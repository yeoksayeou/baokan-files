Points to Note When Taking Over the National Telecommunications Industry

　　Now that Nanjing has been liberated, the takeover of many national-level enterprises is about to begin. Based on my experience over the years, I offer a few suggestions regarding the takeover of materials in the national telecommunications industry. Due to the corrupt rule of the Kuomintang, all publicly-owned enterprises have been infiltrated by embezzling parasites. The telecommunications industry is no exception. Because the rear areas during the War of Resistance were in the Northwest, Southwest, Jiangnan, and the coastal areas of the Southeast, these regions were ruled by the Kuomintang for even longer, and the methods of plundering the people's property were even more varied than in the Northeast and North China.

　　The operating revenue and expenditure of the telecommunications industry itself usually do not balance; however, because there are large amounts of special construction funds and administrative subsidies, the funds of second-level agencies (referring to agencies directly under the Telecommunications Administration, including regional administrations and special-grade telecommunications bureaus) are not usually short. This is because a large portion of the special construction funds can be diverted to general expenses.

　　Some telecommunications agencies have on-site audits, but these are mostly just for show and do not serve much purpose.

　　Some construction funds have a separate set of accounting books, while others are mixed into the ordinary operating revenue and expenditure accounts.

　　Some construction expenses, such as erecting a certain line or installing a certain component, often involve the entire amount being claimed in advance by the contracting agency or contractor. Therefore, the expenditure amount of the allocating agency is not the actual amount that has been spent. When there is a major change in the situation, embezzlers often use this opportunity to make a large fortune.

　　The funds of agencies below the second level (various telecommunications bureaus, engineering line and equipment sections, teams, and stations) are mostly kept in commercial banks under the private names of the supervisors, or not kept at all, and often no formal accounts are established. During the transition period, it is very easy to convert public funds into private property.

　　Engineering personnel who erect, dismantle, and repair lines usually collude with the Baos and Jia heads and the stationed troops. The requisitioned telephone poles and laborers, although reimbursed according to their value, may not actually be paid to the people at all. Bulky line materials, especially during line installation and dismantling, are mostly stockpiled among the people, with the Baos and Jia heads responsible for guarding them; in the event of military advances and retreats, these materials are very easily transferred into private hands. This is especially true when the engineering personnel remain the same.

　　Buying materials and repairing components is a good opportunity to make money in the telecommunications industry. Some local electrical material stores, printing factories, electrical equipment factories, car repair shops, foundries, and iron factories have shares held by telecommunications agency employees, or even are operated under the guise of groups, specializing in handling transactions with the agency as their main business. The capital and raw materials, and even the equipment, of these businesses are blood-related to the people's telecommunications assets. If the material purchases, machine repairs, or construction of a telecommunications agency in a certain place are frequently transacted with a certain business, special attention should be paid.

　　Renting land to build houses, with the buildings becoming the property of the landlord after a certain number of years, or going bankrupt and being repaired by the lessee, who then rents them out at regular rental fees. These are all done by relatively powerful people in various agencies. Outwardly, it looks like a contractual relationship, but in reality, the landlord or owner is themselves. However, using this opportunity to increase the value of one's own property is still a disguised form of embezzling public funds.

　　The above-mentioned matters may not exist in the process of taking over the telecommunications industry in Beiping; even if they do, perhaps the responsible authorities have already taken notice. However, I feel that speaking out will not have a negative impact on the takeover of the people's assets, so I am submitting these opinions without fear of being trivial.

### 接管全国电信事业应注意些什么？

　　接管全国电信事业应注意些什么？
    南京解放了，许多全国性的事业接收就要开始。我基于历年工作上见闻，对全国电信事业物资的接收，提供几点意见。由于国民党腐败的统治，凡属公营事业，没有不被贪污蛀虫浸蚀者。电信事业也不能例外。因为抗战的后方，在西北、西南、江南及东南的滨海区，那些地区被国民党统治更久，掠夺人民财产的方法也比东北、华北的花样更多。
    电信事业本身的营业收支，通常是入不敷出；但是因为有大宗的建设专款与行政贴补，实际上第二级机关（指电信总局直辖的机关，包括区管理局与特等电信局）的经费是不致短绌的。因为建设专款有大部分可挪作一般经费。
    电信机关有些虽驻有就地审计，那多半是点缀品，并不起什么作用。
    那些建设专款，有的另有一套会计簿籍，亦有的混入普通营业收支帐内。
    有些建设经费，如架设某条线路，装设某部机件，多半是将全部经费由承办机关或承办员事先全部领去。因此拨款机关的支出数，并非实际已经支用的数目。在时局有剧变时，贪污者每借此发一大笔财。
    第二级以下的机关（各电信局、各工程线路机务段、队、站）的经费，大都用主管私人名义存在商业银行，或者不存，且又多半不设立正式帐簿。在过渡时期很易化公为私有。
    在外架线拆线修线的工程人员，通常与保甲长及驻军是有勾结的。征用的电杆木与民工，尽管按值报销，实际上可能根本不支付给人民。笨重的线料，尤其在设线与拆线时，多半分屯在民间，由保甲长负责看管；军事上有进退时，这些物资极易转到私人手中。特别是工程人员仍旧是原人负责的时候。
    买材料，修机件，在电信机关是个弄钱的好机会。有些地方的电料行、印刷厂、电工器材厂、修理汽车厂、翻砂厂、铁工厂，都有电信机关职员的股份，甚至是集团的化名经营，专以承办该机关交易为主要营业。这种商号的资本与原料，甚至设备，与人民的电信产业有血缘系关。如其某地电信机关的购料，修机，或建筑，系经常与某商号交易的，宜特加注意。
    租地建屋，若干年后建筑物归地主所有，或者破产由承租者修理，再按期出租金承租。这些都是各机关比较有权势的人干的。外表看去是契约关系，实则地主或屋主就是自己。不过借此机会增加自己的产业价值，依然是浸蚀公款的变相。
    上述几件事，在北平电信事业的接收过程中，也许没有这种事例；即使有，也许已被主管当局注意到了。不过我觉得说出来对于人民的产业接收不致有坏影响，所以不嫌琐赘的作为意见提出。读者  蒋树森
