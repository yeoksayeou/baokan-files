“We'll build wherever you fight!”
    Li Jiuzhe
    These past few days, the wind has been whipping up yellow sand, the sky and earth blending into one, never stopping from morning till night. The laborers are covered head to toe in mud. And wouldn't you know it! The railway is being built south, but the wind is blowing north. The workers hammering spikes push against the wind, the villagers' carts carrying steel rails are swallowed by the yellow wind, and the trucks carrying sleepers roll like turbulent waves in the wind. In weather this bad, normally all work would be stopped, but this group of laborers is working on a great project with a deadline! Early in the morning, before it's even light, teams emerge from the gale, each wearing those dog-skin or fox-fur hats. As soon as people see this unusual insignia, they shout, "The Northeast Army is moving south again!" The rubber-tired carts pulled by four mules, two abreast, come one after another. Some are loaded with boxes marked with red crosses, others with neat small luggage and daily necessities like buckets and wooden troughs. The soldier drivers sit high on the luggage on the front of the carts, swaying and swaying, cracking those long whips with red silk ribbons tied to the ends... All of this, everything, is so familiar and so heartwarming to the iron-willed warriors. The laboring warriors run, quickly laying the sleepers and sections of steel rail into a new road.
    During a brief rest, the warriors gather into countless small meetings, anxiously discussing one question: "The army is moving south, we need to speed up the repairs!" The entire first squad gathers together, looking at each other: "Look, we haven't fixed the road, and comrades are walking south." The warriors are clearly upset, feeling sorry for the southern expeditionary warriors marching away in the yellow wind. The instructor seizes this opportunity to give everyone a lesson. He says simply: "If we let the Northeast Army walk south across the river, how many days would that take? Just to the Yangtze River is over two thousand li. At eighty li a day, that's three eights are twenty-four, so it would take a month! If they take the train, it'll only take two days! Comrades, we need to speed up the repairs. There are still large units behind!" When they see the army marching, the comrades feel uneasy. Adding the instructor's lesson makes them even more restless. They can't rest any longer, so they pick up their tools and get to work. The first company's mobile blackboard news also features drawings in chalk. The culture instructor runs between the working rows, and the warriors glance at the drawings on the blackboard, then run forward as if afraid to look any longer. The drawings show a group of people repairing a railway, but only a small section has been repaired. A short distance ahead of this small section of railway, lines of the southern expeditionary army are drawn, some driving horse-drawn carts, others carrying luggage. The meaning is that the army marching south on foot is "leaving behind" those repairing the railway. The warriors' emotions are stirred, the ones driving spikes and the ones fastening fishplates propose a competition, the ones carrying steel rails and the ones carrying sleepers issue challenges, all determined to "sweat more, finish the road sooner, and get the troops moving south a day earlier." The infantry company driving spikes proposes that they guarantee the spikes will be driven well and quickly, "Wherever the ones tightening screws reach, the spikes will be driven there." The first company tightening screws proposes, "As long as the materials are supplied, we will resolutely complete eight kilometers a day." The laboring ranks race in the storm, and slogans written in chalk appear on the steel rails: "Warriors, catch up quickly!" "Guarantee quality." The spike-driving team sees that it is about to fall behind, and the following is written on the steel rail ahead: "Quickly catch up with the screw team." The team led by foreman Gong, who is at the front, is working hard. The young men drive down a spike with four or five hammer blows. The ones tightening screws are not far behind either. Pei Zaiyuan fastens a set of screws in twenty minutes. Everyone just wants to move forward, and no one wants to fall behind. After a while, the supervisor looks at his watch. From 9:30 to 10:40, the spike drivers drove one kilometer and five hundred thirty-six meters, and the ones fastening fishplates completed one kilometer and six hundred meters. Everyone is confident that completing eight kilometers today will not be a problem.
    At noon, the army passes again. The cannons are too many to count, pulled by six mules, pulled by eight mules, "clunking" and "clunking" as they climb along the bumpy dirt road. The iron-willed warriors are anxious, and the villagers pulling steel rails are also worried: "When will such big cannons 'clunk' to Nanjing!" There's no time to look at the beautiful cannons. An old man of forty or fifty jumps onto the cart shaft, raises his whip, and shouts, urging his old rickety cart to rush towards the place where the steel rails are being unloaded... The southern expeditionary artillery warriors, riding on tall foreign horses, watch the intense flow of laborers, and their hearts are also stirred. They wave to the iron-willed warriors and shout:
    "Work hard! Fix the railway, and we'll be able to get everything else behind us!"
    "Don't worry, we guarantee to build wherever you fight!" A chorus of replies immediately rises from the iron-willed warriors.

　　“你们打到哪里，我们修到哪里！”
    李久泽
    这几天啊，大风卷着黄沙，天地连成一片，从早到晚没有停过，劳动的人，混身上下变成了一个泥人。可不巧啦！铁路往南修，大风往北刮，打锤的顶着风赶上去，老乡们拉钢轨的车被黄风吞蚀了，载枕木的汽车象一股激流似的滚动在风的波浪中。象这样的恶天气，按照习惯，是一切工作都要停工的，但是，这群劳动人是在干着一件有时间性的伟大工程啊！早晨，天还不大亮，就从狂风里钻出了一股股的队伍，一个个带着那狗皮的，狐狸皮的大皮帽子，一看见这个异样的标帜，人们就喊了起来：“东北大军又南下啦！”那两个皮轮的四个骡子拉着的胶轮车一辆紧跟着一辆的过来了，有的拉着满满的，贴着红十字的箱子，有的拉着一些整齐的小行李和水桶、木槽等日常用具，战士车夫高高的坐在车前板的行李上，摇呀摇的，摇着那样长的大鞭，鞭梢上栓着红绸子布条，……这一切，一切，在铁纵的战士看来是那么熟悉，那么亲热。劳动的战士奔跑着，把一根根的枕木，一节节的钢轨迅速铺成新的路。
    一霎那的休息，战士们集成无数的小会，焦急的咯吵着一个问题：“大军南下啦，要加油修呀！”一中队的全体战士集合在一起了，面面相视：“你看，我们没有修好路，叫同志们走着南下。”战士们那种心情，看来的难过的，觉着对不起那在黄风中走远了的南征战士。教导员借着这个机会也给大家上了一课，他简捷的说：“让东北大军走着南下过江，那得多少天呀，就说到长江边两千多里路吧，一天走八十，三八二十四，还得走一个月啦，要坐火车，不用两天就到啦！同志们要加油修，大队伍还在后头啦！”当看到大军步走，同志们心里就很不安顿，再加教导员这么一课，就更沉不住气了，休息也休息不下去了，拿起家伙就干起来了。一连的流动黑板报上，也出现了用粉笔画的画子，文化教员提着跑在劳动的行间里，战士们瞥一瞥那黑板上的画子，就向前飞跑起来，好象不敢多看一眼似的，那画子上，一边画着一群人在修铁路，只修了一小段，这一小段铁路的前边，不小的一个距离的地方，画着一行一行南下的大军，赶着马车的，背着行李的，那意思是说，步行南下的大军把修铁路的“拉”下了。战士们的情绪沸腾起来，打道钉的和上夹板螺丝的提出竞赛，抬钢轨和扛枕木的下挑战书，都抱定一个决心“咱多流点汗，早修好路，早叫部队南下一天”。打道钉的步兵连提出，道钉保证打的好，又打的快“上螺丝的上到哪里，打钉打到哪里”，上螺丝的一连就提出“只要材料供得上，一天坚决完成八公里”。劳动的行列在暴风里赛跑，钢轨上出现了用粉笔写成的路标：“勇士们，快追上！”“保证质量”。道钉组眼看就要丢在后头啦，前边钢轨上写着：“快快追上螺丝组”打在前头的巩工长那组，小伙子们可卖力气啦，四、五锤就打下一个钉子，上螺丝的也不差，裴在元一个人二十分钟就上好一付螺丝。只想前进，谁也不愿落在后头。一会，监工员看了一下表，从九点三十分干到十点四十分，打道钉的打了一公里五百三十六米，上螺丝夹板的上了一公里六百米。大家有信心，今天修八公里不成问题。
    天正午，大军又过来啦，那大炮啦，可数不过来，六个骡子拉着的，八个骡子拉着的“咣当”“咣当”的，在那坑坑窝窝的汽车路上爬着，铁的战士们看了心焦，拉钢轨的老乡们看了也怪着急：“这么大的大炮，多咱‘咣当’到南京啊！”多好看的大炮也来不及看了。一个四五十岁的老头，跳上车辕子，扬起鞭子吆喝着，他那套老牛破车，朝着卸钢轨的地方急奔而去。………南征的炮兵勇士，骑在高大的洋马上，看着那激烈的劳动人流，他心里也沸腾起来了，向铁的战士们挥着手喊着：——
    “好好干呀，修好铁路，咱后边啥也都能来啦！”
    “请好吧，你们打到哪里，我们保证修到哪里！”铁的战士们立刻响起一片回敬声。
