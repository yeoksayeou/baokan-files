Tangshan Inspection Station Workers Voluntarily Hand Over Equipment

[Tangshan Electric] Workers at the Tangshan Railway Bureau's Telecommunications Section Inspection Station, after studying, and with the consciousness of being masters of their own affairs, handed over equipment that they had secretly hidden during the rule of the Japanese invaders and Chiang Kai-shek bandits to the public. Workers Yao Junrui and Li Chaizhong were transferred from Changli. When the Chiang Kai-shek bandits retreated from Changli last year, they buried factory tools underground in the midst of artillery fire to preserve them. Now they have dug them all out and handed them over to the public, including a PM ammeter, two 2-inch wire tighteners, a track jack, a swivel lock, and several other tools. Under the influence of Yao and Li, supervisor Liu Defa, seeing the lack of equipment, also contributed equipment he had stored from the period of the puppet Manchukuo Railway ten years ago. In addition, worker Zhang Lansheng also contributed a crane (capable of lifting fifteen tons) that he had preserved during the rule of the Japanese invaders.

　　唐山检车所工人献交器材
    【唐山电】唐山铁路局电务段检车所工友经过学习，以主人翁的自觉，把过去日寇和蒋匪统治时私藏的器材献给公家。姚俊瑞、李柴忠二工友，是从昌黎调来的，去年昌黎蒋匪溃退时，他们在炮火下把工厂工具埋藏在地下保存，现在全挖出来交给公家，计ＰＭ型电表一个，二寸的紧线器两把，道掳子一个，旋锁一个，另有其他工具数种。在姚、李二工友影响下，监工员刘得发看到器材缺乏，把自己十年前在伪满铁路时期存的器材，也献交出来。此外，工友张兰生把日寇统治时自己保存的起重机（能起十五吨重）也献交公家了。
