Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, April 24th—The incident of British imperialist warships assisting Kuomintang troops by shelling the People's Liberation Army defense zone on the Yangtze River has aroused infinite anger among the people of Beiping. The Preparatory Committee of the Beiping Municipal Federation of Trade Unions issued a protest yesterday, stating that this action by the British Navy is another vivid exposure of the ugly face of imperialism. All imperialists: If you do not abandon your aggressive attempts to antagonize the Chinese people, you will immediately face a tragic and complete defeat. The protest also stated: This traitorous crime of the Kuomintang proves that they not only have no sincerity for peace that takes the people into consideration, but are also intensifying their betrayal of the motherland, colluding with imperialists to oppose the people. The负责人 (fù zé rén, person in charge) of the All-China Students' Federation issued a statement saying: We demand that the armed forces of British and American imperialism withdraw from China together. Students at Yanjing University issued a warning regarding the British government's dispatch of warships to assist the Chiang bandit gang in combat, stating: If British imperialist warships dare to continue to assist the Kuomintang bandit gang in doing evil in China, the British government shall be held responsible for the consequences.

    要求美英武装一齐退出中国
    【新华社北平二十四日电】英帝国主义兵舰，帮助国民党部队，在长江向人民解放军防区炮击一事引起了北平人民的无限愤怒。北平市职工总会筹委会昨天发表抗议书说，英国海军此举为帝国主义狰狞面目的又一次鲜明的暴露。各帝国主义者：如不放弃与中国人民为敌的侵略企图，将立即招致失败的悲惨绝局。该抗议书又说：国民党这一卖国罪行是证明他们不但毫无以人民为念的和平诚意，而且正变本加厉地出卖祖国，勾结帝国主义者与人民为敌。全国学联的负责人发表谈话说：我们要求英美帝国主义的武装一齐退出中国去。燕大学生对英国政府派遣军舰协助蒋匪作战的暴行，发出警告说：英帝国主义军舰如果胆敢继续在中国协助国民党匪帮作恶，其后果应由英国政府负责。
