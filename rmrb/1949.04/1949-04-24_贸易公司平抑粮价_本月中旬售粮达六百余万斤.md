　　Trading Company Stabilizes Grain Prices
　　Over Six Million Jin of Grain Sold Mid-Month
　　[Ping City News] The trading company sold a total of 6,647,000 jin of grain in mid-month, of which corn had the largest sales volume, reaching 3,118,400 jin, accounting for 46.91% of the total sales. Millet was the second highest, at 1,459,800 jin. The rest included sorghum, tongfen (a type of wheat flour noodle), Northeast sorghum, buckwheat, etc. However, due to the lack of rain in the Central Hebei region, grain prices are higher in the south and lower in the north. Merchants from Jixian and Shunyi in Eastern Hebei and Anguo Wurenqiao in Central Hebei came to Ping City to purchase grain, resulting in the outflow of coarse grains. Additionally, the Tianjin Canal is currently under repair, obstructing the source of wheat, leading to a price increase of 150 yuan per bag of tongfen in Tianjin on the 15th. The prices of flour and rice in this city also increased under the influence of Tianjin's price hikes. Rice prices rose the most compared to other grains due to a reduction in sources from Xiaozhan and other places, with an increase of 35.38% compared to the first ten days of the month. The overall grain price index rose from 162.9 in the first ten days of the month to 183.9, an increase of 13.1%. As of the 21st, fine grains have shown a slight decline because grain prices in Tianjin have stabilized, while coarse grains are still rising slightly due to the outflow.

　　贸易公司平抑粮价
  　本月中旬售粮达六百余万斤
    【平市讯】本月中旬贸易公司出售粮食，计达六百六十四万七千斤，其中以玉米销量最大，达三百一十一万八千四百斤，占销售总量百分之四六·九一。口小米次之，为一百四十五万九千八百斤。其余为高粱、通粉、东北高粱、荞麦等。但因冀中区至今仍未落雨，粮价形成南高北低现象。冀东蓟县、顺义及冀中安国伍仁桥等地商贩来平购粮，致粗粮外流。又天津运河正值修理，小麦来源受阻，致津市通粉十五日每袋升一五○元，本市面粉、大米在津市上涨影响下亦形上提。大米因小站等地来源减少，价格较他种粮食上升为多，较上旬上涨达百分之三五·三八。综计粮价指数自上旬一六二·九上升至一八三·九，比上旬涨百分之一三·一。自二十一日起，因津市粮价已稳，细粮已微显回落，粗粮因有外流仍稍涨。
