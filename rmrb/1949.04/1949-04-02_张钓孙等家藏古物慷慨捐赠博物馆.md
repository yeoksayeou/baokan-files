　　[This City News] The Municipal History Museum recently received several donated antiquities. These include seventeen Song and Yuan porcelain pieces excavated from Julu County donated by Mr. Zhang Diaosun. Mr. Zhang personally went to Julu for archeological research in the twelfth year of the Republic of China and authored the book "A Collection of Song Ceramics from Julu." The porcelain pieces donated this time are mostly recorded in that book and are very precious. In addition, Mr. Pei Zhenshan, Mr. Zhang Jingxuan, Mr. Zhang Weizhen, and Mr. Huang Jinghan, four antique dealers from Liulichang in this city, donated hundreds of items to the museum, including Han tiles unearthed in Shaanxi, Tang porcelain unearthed in Luoyang, and Ming Dynasty embroidery paintings.
