　　The Machines Have Become Younger
    Su Youmin
    The production of the Ji'nan Flour Company in March approached pre-war levels. This is a direct result of the high degree of enthusiasm and tool innovation displayed by all employees.

    The factory's engine is twenty-nine years old. Although it is not past its insurance period, it is somewhat old and dull. Therefore, since it reached a peak of over a thousand bags per day in 1934, production has decreased year by year. During the period of enemy and puppet rule, the lowest daily output was only four hundred bags. Since the liberation of Handan in October 1945, the workers have become the masters of the machines, and the factory has gradually realized democratic leadership. Therefore, since the resumption of work in July last year after preparing for war, the daily output has increased month by month from four hundred bags in August, to five hundred bags in September, and then surged to eight hundred and eleven bags in October and November. This year in February, it further increased to eight hundred and seventy-six bags. Since March, the workers have embraced the spirit of the Labor University and actively demanded increased production; however, the aging of the machines has presented great difficulties. Initially, based on production enthusiasm, they competed with each other, increasing their working hours to ten to twelve hours per day, but the bran was not clear, and the phenomenon of running empty occurred, so production still stalled. The boiler room stoking technicians were sweating profusely, but the steam still frequently failed to build up. Sometimes, even when the steam was raised to the maximum of one hundred and twenty pounds allowed by the machines, the problem of running empty could not be solved. As a result, everyone felt very frustrated, which led to mutual complaints.

    Based on this, the factory management committee decided to repair the machines, calling on everyone to carefully find the problems in their respective positions. After ten days of careful inspection and the technicians' research and discussion, it was decided to stop work for four days for repairs. Under everyone's high degree of labor enthusiasm, each person added to the originally scheduled working hours, breaking through the plan to repair only during the day, and forming a situation where work was done both day and night. As a result, the entire repair task was completed in two and a half days. In addition to general repairs, the first step was the result of painstaking research by technician Shi Huaizhi and others, who transformed the small lever on the steam slide valve of the engine. This is a decisive link in the successful transformation of the machine. Because the small lever controls the size of the air displacement, its flexibility determines the speed of the machine. Because the engine is old, the parts are no longer flexible, even stagnant. The screw sleeve at one end of the lever is subject to long-term friction from the air displacement shaft, and the internal space is enlarged, making it impossible to fit tightly, so the steadying rudder cannot accurately grasp the size of the valve controlled by the lever, so that the steam from the boiler cannot be fully input into the cylinder to drive the engine to rotate. After discovering this problem, due to the limitations of repair tools and the lack of ready-made parts, one end of the small lever was sawn off by four points. This not only did not damage the machine, but also strengthened the lever's control over the valve, overcoming the previous shortcomings. Secondly, for the overhead shaft tiles on the flour milling floor, which had never been paid attention to, the responsible workers completely filled them with babbitt, making the machine healthier and allowing it to rotate lightly, reducing the burden on the engine. After the repair shop's roller drawing machine overcame the previous shortcomings of being different sizes at both ends and having a smaller inclination, the bran became clearer and more flour was produced. Before the repair, because the air damper was too high off the ground, the suction of the chimney was increased, and the fire in the pot was stimulated, making it difficult for the boiler to generate steam, and the stoking workers suffered from twice the effort for half the result. During this repair, the stoking technicians Yan Guitang and Li Chunyu personally repaired the air damper, unafraid of the ashes burning their socks. To save time, they bravely completed the task.

    Under the high production enthusiasm of all employees, the machines were healthy, fuel was saved, and the machines exerted the great power of their youth, reaching a record close to pre-war levels.

　　机器变得年青了
    苏幼民
    三月份冀南面粉公司的产量，接近了战前水平。这是全体职工高度发挥积极性、改造工具的直接结果。
    该厂发动机已有二十九年的历史，虽未过保险期，然已有些老钝了。故自民国二十三年达到日产千余袋的高峰以后，产量一年比一年减低，在敌伪统治期间，最低仅日产四百袋。自一九四五年十月邯郸解放后，工人成了机器的主人，工厂逐步实现了民主领导，故自去年备战后七月复工以来，由八月的日产四百袋起，逐月增加为九月的五百袋，十月、十一月则激增到八一一袋，今年二月更增至八七六袋。三月以来，工人接受了劳大精神，积极要求增产；可是机器的老钝却给了很大的困难。开始基于生产热情相互竞赛，每人增到十时至十二时的工作时间，而劲麸皮却不清亮，打空车的现象存在，产量仍止步不前。锅炉房烧火技工累得满头大汗，气还是经常烧不起来。有时虽烧到机器所能允许的最高度一百二十磅，却仍然解决不了打空车问题。于是大家感到十分苦闷，遂致相互埋怨。
    工厂管理委员会据此决心修理机器，号召大家用心寻找自己岗位上的毛病。经过十天仔细检查，技工们的钻研讨论，确定以四天时间停工修理。在大家高度发挥劳动积极性下，每个人都按原定工时加了工，以致冲破仅限白天修理的计划，形成黑夜白天都动工，结果以两天半时间，完成全部修理任务。除一般修理外，首先是由技师师怀智等苦心钻研的结果，改造了引擎入汽滑瓣上的＠爪小拉杆，这是改造机器成功的决定一环。由于小拉杆掌握着错气大小，它的运动灵活与否，决定着车的快慢。由于引擎已老，因之机件已不灵活，甚至停滞。＠爪一端所置螺丝套筒，受错气轴长年摩擦，内身空间大了，相互不能紧靠，因而稳气舵也不能确实掌握＠爪掌握的汽门大小，使锅炉里来的蒸气不能尽投入气缸，催动引擎旋转。发现此毛病后，受修理工具的限制和缺乏现成机件，即将小拉杆一端锯去四分，如此既对机器无损伤，又加强了拉杆对汽门的控制力，克服了以前缺点。其次对于历来没有理睬过的制粉楼上的天轴瓦，负责的工人们完全灌了乌金，健康了机器，使它得到轻快旋转，减轻了引擎的负担。修理房滚子拉丝克服了以前两端不一样大和倾斜度较小的缺点后，使劲麸皮清亮了，面粉多出了。修理前，因风闸板离地太高，加大了烟囱吸力，锅心火力受刺激，致使锅炉不易烧起气来，烧火工人受事倍功半之苦。这次修理时，烧火技工阎贵堂、李春雨，亲自动手修理风闸板，不怕灰烬未息而烧着了袜子，为争取时间，终于勇敢地完成了任务。
    全体职工在高度的增产热忱下，健康了机器、节省了燃料，使机器发挥着青年时代的巨力，达到了接近战前水平的纪录。
