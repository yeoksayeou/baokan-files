Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 8th. The public in Beiping, in support of the Nanjing patriotic student massacre, is awaiting the Nanjing government's handling of this case, especially waiting for Nanjing Kuomintang Garrison Commander Zhang Yaoming to express his attitude, as he is undoubtedly directly responsible for this massacre. Although Zhang Yaoming claimed on April 3rd, the day after the massacre, that "I cannot shirk my responsibility and have already asked my superiors for punishment," his spokesperson Luo Chunbo made absurd remarks on the same day, claiming that "this incident was entirely orchestrated by a few professional students under the instigation of a certain party, plotting to disrupt public order and obstruct peace." Zhang Yaoming and his spokesperson described the massacre as a so-called "mutual fight" between the reception unit soldiers and students, and claimed that "the reception unit soldiers were all captured by the Communist army and escaped, or were trained by the Communist army for a few days and then released," and "the professional students actually pointed to the reception unit members as armed secret service executioners, hoping to shift the blame to this headquarters." Zhang Yaoming and his spokesperson slandered the students for "obstructing peace," as if they themselves were not opposed to peace. They even pretended to be pitiful, saying that people were "hoping to shift the blame" to this garrison headquarters. However, their entire conversation proves that they are a group of Chiang Kai-shek's die-hards who still have no intention of repenting. Zhang Yaoming and his spokesperson referred to the beating to death of patriotic students by secret agents as a "mutual fight" between students and the reception unit. This is the trademark of Chiang Kai-shek's die-hards. They said that the patriotic students were "professional students under the instigation of a certain party," which is also the trademark of Chiang Kai-shek's die-hards. The so-called "certain party" is obviously referring to the Chinese Communist Party, but they also said that the reception unit soldiers were trained by the Communist army for a few days and then released, implying that the reception unit was also under the instigation of the CCP. That is to say, the reception unit under the instigation of the CCP and the "professional students" under the instigation of the CCP were fighting each other under the instigation of the CCP, with the purpose of "obstructing peace" and incidentally "shifting the blame" to Commander Zhang Yaoming. Observers here believe that Commander Zhang Yaoming is indeed in trouble, because not only did he massacre students under the instigation of Chiang Kai-shek, for which "I cannot shirk my responsibility," but he also fabricated slander afterwards, which should be an even greater crime. Zhang Yaoming said that he had asked his superiors for punishment, which is of course bureaucratic formality. However, if Zhang Yaoming does not immediately plan to atone for his crimes, then the new superiors, the People's Liberation Army, will definitely punish him: the people of the whole country have expressed their anger at the masterminds of the Nanjing massacre, and the People's Liberation Army, which is about to cross the river to the south, must carry out the will of the people.

　　北平人民声援“四一”血案
  　等待南京政府表明态度      
    即将渡江的人民解放军一定要执行人民意志，严惩杀人罪犯。
    【新华社北平八日电】北平方面声援南京爱国学生血案的公众，正在等待南京政府对于这一血案的处理，特别是等待南京国民党卫戍总司令张耀明表明自己的态度，因为他无疑是这一血案的直接负责者。张耀明虽于血案发生的次日即本月三日声称：“本人当不能辞其咎，现已向上峰自请处分”，但是本月三日他的发言人罗春波却又发表荒谬的谈话，竟称“此次事件全系少数职业学生受某方指使，阴谋扰乱治安，阻碍和平而导演”。张耀明及其发言人把血案描写为所谓收容总队官兵与学生“互殴”，并称“收容总队官兵均系被共军俘虏后逃回，或被共军训练数日而放回”，“而职业学生竟指收容队员为武装特务刽子手，希图嫁祸于本部”。张耀明及其发言人毁蔑学生“阻碍和平”，似乎他们自己并不反对和平，他们并且装作可怜的样子，说人们“希图嫁祸”于这个卫戍总司令部，但是他们自己的全部谈话，却是不打自招地证明他们是一批至今尚无悔祸之心的蒋介石死党。张耀明及其发言人指学生被特务凶殴致死为学生与收容总队“互殴”，这是蒋介石死党的商标。他们说爱国的学生是“职业学生受某方指使”，这又是蒋介石死党的商标。所谓的某方显然是指中国共产党，但是他们又说收容总队的官兵是被共军训练数日而放回，暗示收容总队也是受中共指使。这就是说，中共指使下的收容总队与中共指使下的“职业学生”在中共指使下互殴，其目的在于“阻碍和谈”，附带“嫁祸”于张耀明总司令。此间观察家相信：张耀明总司令确是有祸了，因为他不但在蒋介石指使下屠杀了学生，“本人当不能辞其咎”，并且还在事后信口雌黄，造成污蔑，应该罪加一等。张耀明说已向上峰自请处分，这当然是官样文章。但是张耀明如果不立即作立功赎罪的打算，那么新的上峰即人民解放军对于他们处分是一定逃不了的：全国人民已经纷纷表示了对于南京血案祸首们的愤怒，即将渡江南进的人民解放军，不能不执行人民的意志。
