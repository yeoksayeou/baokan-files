Xinhua News Agency Editor's Note: Mr. Zhu Junxin, Standing Committee Member of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, Mr. Xie Bangding, Chairman of the All-China Student Federation, Mr. Chen Qiyu, President of Hong Kong Da De College, Mr. Zhang Naiqi, Standing Director of the China Democratic National Construction Association, Mr. Mao Dun, Director of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles and Vice Chairman of the Preparatory Committee of the All-China Congress of Literary and Art Workers, Mr. Shen Tilan, former professor of Yenching University and St. John's University, Mr. Zhang Zhirang, former professor of Fudan University and Peking University, and other representatives of various democratic parties and people's organizations continued to deliver radio speeches from the Beiping Xinhua Broadcasting Station on the evening of the 21st, responding to the World Congress of Advocates for Peace held in Paris and Prague, supporting our delegation attending the congress, and unanimously denouncing the Nanjing reactionary government's rejection of the domestic peace agreement. The following are the original radio speeches of Mr. Chen Qiyu, Mr. Zhang Naiqi, and Mr. Mao Dun:

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
　　Chen Qiyu
  　Chen Qiyu, President of Hong Kong Da De College:
    To peace-loving people all over the world, and to all compatriots at home and abroad in China:
    Tonight, Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu issued an order for the People's Liberation Army to advance bravely and announced the full text of the "Domestic Peace Agreement" in eight articles and twenty-four clauses. This order has significant implications for the interests of all Chinese people and the independence and integrity of China's territorial sovereignty. The full text of this agreement completely exposes the conspiracy of Chiang Kai-shek's bandits and the U.S. imperialists and their Nanjing reactionary government to prepare for war under the guise of peace, and gives it a powerful counterattack. I call on all compatriots at home and abroad in China to unite and resolutely support its implementation to the end.
    In the past month, there have been three incidents of refusal to sign: the first was the U.S. government's refusal to issue entry visas to peace representatives from Britain, Europe, and South American countries to the New York World Peace Congress; the second was the French government's refusal to issue entry permits to more than eight delegates from various countries to the World Congress of Advocates for Peace; and the third was yesterday's public refusal by the Nanjing reactionary government to sign the "Domestic Peace Agreement" drafted by the CCP delegation and the Nanjing delegation after lengthy discussions. These three consecutive refusal incidents are not isolated or accidental, but have a connected reactionary meaning. That is, it shows that the international reactionary group headed by U.S. imperialism and its running dog Chiang Kai-shek's Nanjing reactionary faction are anti-people, anti-democratic, and anti-revolutionary to the end, and it also shows that U.S. imperialism, French imperialism, and Chiang Kai-shek are all talking about peace, embracing war, rejecting peace, launching aggression, and remaining unrepentant. In his New Year's Day message this year, Chiang Kai-shek boasted about "discussing the cessation of war and the restoration of peace," "benefiting the people's recuperation," and "not harming the country's independence and integrity," all of which have now proven to be a delaying tactic. It proves that "the Nanjing reactionary government is attempting to prevent the People's Liberation Army from advancing in order to gain a respite and then come back to suppress the revolutionary forces." Even Li Zongren's previous so-called acceptance of the CCP's eight peace conditions as a basis has proven to be false and insincere. The clauses of the "Domestic Peace Agreement" announced by the CCP Central Committee tonight are recognized by everyone to be extremely lenient in their treatment of Kuomintang army officers and soldiers, government officials, and even war criminals, truly showing utmost benevolence and righteousness. However, the Nanjing reactionary government still refuses to sign it, which shows that they are still obeying the orders of U.S. imperialism and its bandit leader Chiang Kai-shek. They are not truly considering the interests of the nation, the people, and the people, so they are unwilling to bow their heads to the people.
    I now call on all compatriots at home and abroad in China to unite and resolutely support the order issued by Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu to the People's Liberation Army to advance bravely to the end. We Chinese people vow to unite with the peace-loving people of the world to resolutely support the Paris Peace Conference and wish it a smooth success. We firmly believe that the Chinese people's peace forces under the united banner of the various democratic parties led by the Chinese people's leader Mao Zedong will be able to completely, cleanly, and entirely eliminate Chiang Kai-shek's reactionary forces. We are even more convinced that under the call of the Soviet Union's Stalin's peace banner, the increasingly strong and powerful world people's peace forces will be able to shatter any war-provoking conspiracies and aggressive reactionary forces of U.S. imperialism and its lackeys.
    We are not afraid, U.S. imperialism is a paper tiger! We must not forget that Chiang Kai-shek is a snake that is stiff but not dead! We must kill it!
    Let us shout:
    Unite all Chinese compatriots at home and abroad under the banner of Mao Zedong!
    Support Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu's order to the People's Liberation Army on April 21 to the end!
    Support the People's Liberation Army crossing the river to capture Chiang Kai-shek alive and liberate all of China!
    Unite the world people's peace forces under the banner of the Soviet Union's Stalin!
    Support the World Congress of Advocates for Peace and its resolutions!
    Oppose the U.S. imperialism's North Atlantic Treaty for creating war!
    Long live the liberation of the entire Chinese people!
    Long live the world people's peace forces!
    Long live the World Congress of Advocates for Peace and its representatives!
    Thank you everyone, good night! Finished.
　　Zhang Naiqi
  　Zhang Naiqi, Standing Director of the China Democratic National Construction Association:
    For twenty-two years, the Kuomintang reactionaries, who have consistently believed in force and loved war, suddenly issued a call for peace at the beginning of this year when their military defeat was like a landslide and their main military forces had been annihilated. This is indeed something that is hard to believe. Especially a Kuomintang reactionary faction that has sold out national sovereignty and undermined people's freedom beyond historical records actually proposed safeguarding national sovereignty and independence and the people's free life as conditions for peace among the five peace principles. It is really trying to deceive the Chinese people even when it is dying. Their conspiracy to use peace to gain a respite in order to stage a comeback is further proven by the fact that they stubbornly oppose the People's Liberation Army crossing the river.
    Of course, the people will not be deceived again. In the Kuomintang reactionary-ruled areas, the gold yuan notes are like floods, the secret agents are like wild beasts, and the treacherous activities are proceeding step by step. In addition to selling national sovereignty to U.S. imperialism, they also want to sell it to Britain, France, and even Japan. The voices of the people in the Kuomintang-controlled areas are demanding that the People's Liberation Army arrive quickly. The public opinion of the people in the liberated areas is to quickly liberate the 200 million compatriots in the Kuomintang-controlled areas who are in dire straits, quickly fight to the south of the Yangtze River, destroy the reactionary rule, and arrest the war criminals so that they can no longer sell out the country and harm the people. The Beiping-style peaceful settlement is good, but it must not be delayed. The losses caused by delaying time to the country and the people may be much greater than artillery fire.
    Mr. Mao Zedong, Chairman of the CCP, proposed eight principles in the past to strive for revolutionary peace, and today, together with Commander-in-Chief Zhu De, issued an order to advance bravely, which fully meets the demands of the people. The power of the people is irresistible. The People's Liberation Army on the north bank of the Yangtze River and the people on the south bank will all be overjoyed by this march order. They will soon be able to join hands. Military and political personnel under the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, for the sake of the country, for the sake of the people, and for the sake of the happiness of themselves and their descendants, have no choice but to quickly turn to the People's Liberation Army. This is their only way out.
　　Mao Dun
  　Mao Dun, Director of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles and Vice Chairman of the Preparatory Committee of the All-China Congress of Literary and Art Workers:
    Yesterday, people's representatives from sixty-nine countries around the world convened the World Congress of Advocates for Peace in Paris. This is a manifestation of the will of the vast people around the world who demand peace and true democracy. This is a heavy blow to the war conspiracies of the international reactionary aggressive group headed by U.S. imperialism!
    However, also yesterday, the Nanjing Kuomintang reactionary government rejected the domestic peace agreement drafted by the CCP delegation and the Nanjing Kuomintang government delegation after a long period of negotiations. This incident fully proves that the peace negotiations proposed by the Kuomintang reactionaries since January this year were merely an attempt to prevent the People's Liberation Army from advancing in order to gain a respite and plan for a comeback.
    The Kuomintang reactionaries are the running dogs of U.S. imperialism. Only by completely eliminating the Kuomintang reactionaries can we guarantee true democracy and lasting peace at home. This is the public opinion of the Chinese people.
    Now we know that Chairman Mao of the Chinese People's Revolutionary Military Commission and Commander-in-Chief Zhu of the People's Liberation Army have ordered the entire army to advance bravely and resolutely, thoroughly, cleanly, and completely annihilate all reactionary forces in China who dare to resist. This is carrying out the will of the people. All our compatriots across the country resolutely support this decisive and wise decision by Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu.
    We want to tell the representatives of the World Congress of Advocates for Peace in Paris: Our goals are the same. The Chinese people support your propositions and are willing to do everything in our power to shatter the conspiracies of the international reactionary aggressive group headed by U.S. imperialism to launch a new war and attempt to enslave the people of the world. The Chinese people know that only by completely overthrowing the Kuomintang reactionaries, the running dogs of U.S. imperialism, can we defend the independence and integrity of China's territorial sovereignty. The Chinese people firmly believe that a truly democratic and peaceful China will certainly make a great contribution to the peace and democracy of the people of the world!
    The democratic power of the people is now unprecedentedly strong. The united power of the Chinese people will surely be able to defeat the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary group, the running dogs of U.S. imperialism; the united power of the people of the world will also be able to victoriously shatter the war conspiracy of the international reactionary aggressive group headed by U.S. imperialism to destroy human culture and enslave the people of the world! Let us strengthen our unity, the final victor will not be the reactionary group but the people!

    响应召开世界拥护和平大会痛斥南京政府拒绝和平协定
    新华社编者按：中华全国总工会常务委员朱俊欣先生，全国学生联合会主席谢邦定先生，香港达德学院院长陈其瑗先生，民主建国会常务理事章乃器先生，中国文协理事、中华全国文学艺术工作者代表会筹备委员会副主席茅盾先生，前燕京大学圣约翰大学教授沈体兰先生，前复旦大学北京大学教授张志让先生等各民主党派及人民团体代表二十一日晚续假北平新华广播电台发表广播演说，响应在巴黎及布拉格召开的世界拥护和平大会，声援我出席该会之代表团，并一致痛斥南京反动政府拒绝国内和平协定。兹续志陈其瑗、章乃器、茅盾三先生广播原词如下：
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
　　陈其瑗
  　香港达德学院院长陈其瑗：
    全世界拥护和平的人士们，全中国海内外同胞们：
    今晚毛主席朱总司令向人民解放军发布一个奋勇前进命的令，和公布了“国内和平协定”八条二十四款全文，这一个命令对于我们全中国人民的利益和中国领土主权独立与完整皆有重大的意义。这一个协定全文，把数月来蒋匪和美帝及其主持的南京反动派政府的以和备战的阴谋完全揭穿，予以威力的回击。我号召全中国海内外同胞一致起来坚决拥护其进行到底。
    最近一个月来发现过三次拒绝签字事件：头一件是美国政府拒绝签发纽约世界和平大会从英国、欧洲、南美各国来的和平代表入境证；第二次是法国政府拒绝签发超过八名限额的世界拥护和平大会的各国代表入境证书；第三件就是昨天南京反动政府公开拒签中共代表团与南京代表团经过长时间讨论所拟定的“国内和平协定”。这三个一连串发生的拒签事件不是孤立偶发的，而是有其联系反动的意义存在。即是说明以美帝为首的国际反动集团及其走狗蒋介石的南京反动派都是反人民、反民主、反革命到底的东西，也说明美帝、法帝、蒋介石都是口讲和平、怀抱战争、拒绝和平、发动侵略、至死不悟的东西。蒋介石在其本年元旦文告中，夸夸其谈“商讨停止战争恢复和平”、“有利于人民的休养生息”、“无害于国家的独立完整”的各种好听词句，现在都证明是一种缓兵之计。证明“南京反动政府是企图阻止人民解放军向前推进获得喘息之机会，然后卷土重来扑灭革命势力”，即李宗仁从前所谓承认中共八个和平条件为基础者，亦证明其虚伪无诚意。今晚中共中央所公布的“国内和平协定”的条文，谁都认识其内容是对于国民党军队官兵政府官吏甚至战犯的处理都是极为宽大，真是仁至义尽。但是南京反动政府仍不予以签字，可见他们仍然是服从美帝国主义及其匪首蒋介石的命令，他们不是真正为着国家民族人民利益打算，所以他们不肯对人民低头。
    我现在号召全中国海内外同胞一致起来，坚决拥护今天毛主席朱总司令向人民解放军所发布奋勇前进的命令到底。我们中国人民誓与世界和平人民团结一致坚决拥护巴黎和平大会并预祝其顺利成功。我们坚信在中国人民领袖毛泽东所领导的各民主党派联合旗帜底下的中国人民和平力量，必能彻底干净全部消灭蒋介石反动派势力。我们更坚信在苏联斯大林和平旗帜号召底下，日益壮大坚强的世界人民和平力量，必能粉碎美帝及其走卒的任何挑拨战争阴谋及其侵略的反动势力。
    我们不要怕，美帝是纸老虎！我们不要忘记，蒋介石是僵而未死之蛇！我们必要打死它！
    让我们高呼：
    在毛泽东旗帜底下全中国海内外同胞和平力量团结起来！
    拥护四、二一毛主席朱总司令向人民解放军发布的命令到底！
    拥护人民解放军渡江活捉蒋介石，解放全中国！
    在苏联斯大林旗帜底下全世界人民和平力量团结起来！
    拥护世界拥护和平大会及其决议！
    反对美帝制造战争的北大西洋公约！
    全中国人民解放万岁！
    全世界人民和平力量万岁！
    世界拥护和平大会及其代表万岁！
    谢谢各位，晚安！完了。
　　章乃器
  　民主建国会常务理事章乃器：
    廿二年来，一贯迷信武力，嗜好战争的国民党反动派，在兵败如山倒，军事主力已被歼灭的时候，忽然在今年初发出和平的呼声，的确是使人难以相信的一件事情。尤其一个出卖国家主权，摧残人民自由超过了历史纪录的国民党反动派，居然在五项和平原则当中，提出什么保障国家主权独立和人民自由生活作为和平的条件，真是临死还要想欺骗中国人民。他们借和平以争取喘息时间，以期卷土重来的阴谋，从这次顽固的反对解放军渡江一点上，更得到事实的证明。
    当然，人民是不会再被欺骗了。国民党反动派的统治区域中，金圆券有如洪水，特务有如猛兽，卖国的勾当在着着进行，除了把国家主权卖给美帝国主义外，还想向英、法，以至日本出卖。国统区人民的呼声，是要求人民解放军赶快到来。解放区人民的公意，是赶快解放二万万在水深火热中的国统区同胞，赶快打到江南去，摧毁反动统治，捉拿战犯，使他们不能再出卖国家，伤害人民。北平式的和平解决是好的，但决不能拖延时间，拖延时间对于国家人民的损失，可能比炮火还要大得多。
    中共主席毛泽东先生过去提出八项原则以争取革命的和平，和今天会同总司令朱德先生下令奋勇进军，都完全符合人民的要求。人民的力量是无可抵抗的。长江北岸的人民解放军和南岸的人民，都将为这一进军令而欢欣鼓舞。他们很快的就可以携起手来。国民党反动派统治之下的军事政治人员，为了国家，为了人民，为了自己和子孙的幸福，都只有赶快投向人民解放军。这是他们唯一的出路。
　　茅盾
  　中国文艺协会理事、中华全国文学艺术工作者代表会筹备委员会副主席茅盾：
    昨天，全世界六十九国的人民代表在巴黎召开了世界拥护和平大会，这是全世界要求和平与真民主的广大人民意志的表现，这对于以美帝为首的国际反动侵略集团的战争阴谋是一个沉重的打击！
    可是也就在昨天，南京国民党反动政府拒绝了中共代表团和南京国民党政府代表团经过长时间的谈判所拟定的国内和平协定。这件事，充分证明了国民党反动派从今年一月所提议的和平谈判，不过是企图阻止人民解放军向前推进，以便获得喘息时间，作卷土重来之计。
    国民党反动派是美帝国主义的走狗，彻底消灭国民党反动派然后才能保障国内的真正民主与持久和平。这是中国人民的公意。
    现在我们知道：中国人民革命军事委员会毛主席和人民解放军朱总司令业已命令全军奋勇前进，坚决、彻底、干净、全部地歼灭中国境内一切敢于抵抗的反动派，这是执行了人民的意志，我们全国同胞都坚决拥护毛主席和朱总司令这一果断明智的决定。
    我们要告诉巴黎的世界拥护和平大会的代表们：我们的目标是一致的。中国人民拥护你们的主张，愿意竭尽全力粉碎美帝国主义为首的国际反动侵略集团发动新战争、企图奴役世界人民的阴谋。中国人民知道：唯有把美帝走狗的国民党反动派彻底打倒，然后才能保卫中国领土主权的独立与完整。中国人民深信：实现了真正民主与和平的中国对于全世界人民的和平与民主一定是有巨大的贡献的！
    人民的民主的力量现在是空前地壮大了。中国人民团结一致的力量一定能够战胜美帝走狗蒋介石反动集团；世界人民团结一致的力量也一定能够胜利地粉碎美帝为首的国际反动侵略集团的毁灭人类文化奴役世界人民的战争阴谋！让我们加强团结罢，最后胜利者不是反动集团而是人民大众！
