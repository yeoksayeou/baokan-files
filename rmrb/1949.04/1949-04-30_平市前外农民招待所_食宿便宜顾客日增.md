　　Ping Municipality Qianwai Farmers' Hostel
  　Affordable Accommodation and Meals Lead to Increased Customer Numbers
    [Report from this newspaper] The Qianwai Langfang Toutiao Farmers' Hostel in this city has been growing its business since it opened on the 18th of this month. The number of farmers staying at the hostel each day has increased from eighteen to forty. Farmers staying at the hostel have expressed satisfaction. The reasons for their satisfaction are: 1. The hostel room rates are cheap: An ordinary double room costs only 60 yuan in RMB per day, including tea. The cheapest inn in Ping Municipality costs at least 110 yuan per day. The rooms are also smaller than here. 2. Farmers staying at the hostel can eat together, with a full meal costing only 30 yuan; eating outside would cost far more. 3. The rooms are quiet, and the residents are all fellow villagers, so they feel safe and don't worry about losing their belongings. 4. They receive enthusiastic service from the hostel staff and don't have to worry about being cheated.
    The farmers staying at the hostel mostly come from the rural areas of Pingzhou. They sell chickens, pigs, mountain goods, homespun cloth, pig bristles, and pig hair, and buy straw hats, tobacco leaves, and cloth remnants. In addition to buying and selling on behalf of its guests, the hostel also provides services such as transferring goods (from the freight station to the railway station), buying train tickets, inquiring about market prices, and exchanging border currency, all free of charge. The guests find it convenient and automatically promote the hostel after returning to their villages, which has led to the business growing day by day.

　　平市前外农民招待所
  　食宿便宜顾客日增
    【本报讯】本市前外廊房头条农民招待所自本月十八日开张以来，业务日渐开展。每日在该所住宿的农民已由十八人增加至四十人。在该所留宿的农民均表满意。满意的原因为：一、该所房钱便宜：普通双人房间，日收人民币六十元，茶水费在内。平市最便宜的客栈，每日也得一百一十元。房间还比这里小。二、留宿农民可在该所搭伙，饱餐一顿仅用三十元；在外面吃则远远不够。三、房间清静，住房皆为老乡，彼此放心，无丢东西的顾虑。四、受到该所工作人员的热情招待，用不着担心受骗上当。
    留宿该所的农民多来自平周农村，出卖鸡、猪、山货、土布、猪鬃，猪毛等，买回草帽、烟叶、布头等。该所除代客买卖外，并代为转送（由货栈转到车站）代买车票，打听行市，代为兑换边币等，不取报酬。客人们感到便利，返乡后自动宣传，该所业务就一天天开展了。
