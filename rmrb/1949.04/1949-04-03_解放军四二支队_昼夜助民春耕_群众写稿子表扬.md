　　PLA 42nd Detachment
  　Helps People with Spring Farming Day and Night
  　Masses Write Articles Praising Them
    [Our Newspaper] The various units of the PLA 42nd Detachment, taking advantage of the breaks from political training, have been helping farmers with spring farming in the villages near their garrisons. The "Three Zero" artillery company, seizing every spare moment before and after morning exercises, during breaks between classes, and even at night and before getting up, collected 87 loads of manure and carried 2,740 loads of water for the farmers in the village over the course of twenty days. The division's health department sent over 5,000 baskets of manure in a little over ten days. Soldiers Zhang Diantang from the "Three Zero" Seventh Company, Shang Junsheng, the radio operator squad leader from the headquarters radio station, and Zeng Qi and others, six or seven people in total from the Second Machine Gun Company, used moonlight to pound manure for the villagers. Guo Tianyao, a former KMT soldier of the First Special Company, got up too early every day to pound manure for the villagers, causing his hands to crack from the cold. Still, he pounded manure with all his might. An old woman advised him, "Don't pound anymore, take a rest, your hands are bleeding!" He happily replied, "The harder I work, the less my hands hurt." He alone pounded two large piles of manure for the villagers. "Two Zero" soldier Guo Changtai and others, put down their rifles every day and picked up hoes to pound manure and collect manure for the villagers. As a result, the relationship between the army and the local people became extremely harmonious. The landlady of the small artillery company, an old woman, sent half a basin of hot dumplings on the second day of the second lunar month. Everyone was unwilling to eat them, and the old woman became extremely angry, saying, "You children, why are you so disobedient? Aren't you just like my sons? If you don't eat, then we are not one family!" The old men, watching the soldiers help with production without rest, said with emotion, "The comrades put down their guns and immediately pound manure, I really can't bear it!" And said, "The world has really changed, I've never seen an army working for the people!" Literate villagers wrote articles about the actual deeds of the army helping with farming and prepared to send them to the Jidong "People's Soldiers" newspaper. Wu Yuzhou, a villager from An'gulin, wrote "Field Army Soldiers Help Villagers with Production," and Chen Rang, a 75-year-old man from Zhanggezhuang, wrote an article titled "I Bear Witness for the Soldiers," introducing the harmonious relationship between the PLA and the masses.

　　解放军四二支队
  　昼夜助民春耕
  　群众写稿子表扬
    【本报讯】解放军四二支队各单位利用政治练兵空隙，在驻地附近各村帮助农民春耕。“三零”炮兵连抓紧早操前后、上课休息甚至夜晚及起床前的各个空隙时间，二十天中，帮助驻村农民起了八十七圈粪，担了二千七百四十担水。师卫生部十几天送粪五千多筐。“三零”七连战士张殿堂、司令部电台摇机班长商俊生、机二连战士增起等六、七人，利用月光给老乡捣粪。特一连的解放战士郭天尧，因替老乡捣粪，每天起得太早，手都冻裂了，还是一个劲地捣粪，老大娘劝他说：“不要捣了，休息休息吧，看你手上流血了！”他却高兴地说：“越使劲干，手越不痛。”他一人就给老乡捣了两大堆粪。“二零”战士郭长太等，每天放下大枪就拿起镐头，替老乡捣粪、起圈。这样一来，军队和驻地群众关系极其融洽。小炮连的房东老大娘，在阴历二月二节日，送来半盆热腾腾的饺子，大家都不肯吃，老大娘气极了，说：“你们这群孩子，怎么不听话呀？你们还不是和我的儿子一样？你们不吃，就不是一家人！”老大爷们看着战士们不休息地帮助生产，感动地说：“同志们放下枪就给捣粪，真叫我不忍心！”并说：“真改天换地啦，没见过军队给老百姓干活的！”会写字的老百姓，把军队助耕的实际材料，写成稿子、准备寄到冀东“子弟兵”报去，安固林村民吴郁周写了“野战军战士帮老乡生产”，张各庄七十五岁的老人陈让写的稿子题为“我给军人作见证”，介绍解放军与群众的融洽关系。　　　　　　　（四二支队宣教科）
