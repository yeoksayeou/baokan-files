Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, April 26th: In the production competition to welcome "May Day," workers in Tianjin's public enterprises have successively completed their plans ahead of schedule. The Second Power Plant of Jibei Electric Power Company completed the repair work of boiler No. 6 in only twelve days, ten days ahead of the original plan. The major repair work of boiler No. 12 in the Second Power Plant was also completed in seventeen days, four days ahead of the original plan. The casting team of the Central Radio Equipment Factory originally planned to complete the task of rush-casting 100 wheels on the 22nd of this month, but after launching a shock competition, it was completed ahead of schedule on the 15th. The workers in the team also saved a lot of electricity and fuel in the competition. For example, in the past, it took 1,000 kilograms of coal to bake a box of sand, but now it only takes 600 kilograms. After the North Station track team of the Tianjin Engineering Section of the Pingjin Railway Bureau accepted the task of replacing 1,500 sleepers in 20 days, they replaced 1,000 sleepers in five days due to their work in a spirit of shock. The "May Day" and "Labor" buses repaired by the workers of the Tianjin Automobile Transportation Company maintenance yard were also completed on the 23rd, seven days ahead of the original schedule.

　　迎接五一的生产竞赛中
  　津市公营企业职工
    纷纷提前完成计划
    【新华社天津二十六日电】在迎接“五一”的生产竞赛中，津市公营企业职工纷纷提前完成计划。冀北电力公司第二发电厂仅十二天即完成了六号锅炉的修理工作，较原定计划提前了十天。第二发电厂十二号锅炉的大修理工作亦于十七天内完成，较原定计划提前了四天。中央无线电器材厂铸工组原定本月二十二日完成赶铸一百个车轮子的任务，但在展开突击竞赛后，已提前于十五日完成。该组职工在竞赛中还节省了大量电力和燃料。如过去烘一匣砂箱需煤一千公斤，现在只需六百公斤。平津铁路局天津工务段北站道班工人在接受二十天完成抽换枕木一千五百根的任务后，由于以突击精神进行工作，五天就抽换了一千根。天津汽车运输公司保养场工人所赶修的“五一”“劳动”两号大客车，也于二十三日比原定时间提早七天完成。
