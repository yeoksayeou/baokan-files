　　Support the Kailuan Miners
    Today, we express our utmost indignation as we publish the news of the continuous tragedies occurring at the Kailuan Coal Mine in Tangshan!
    Since liberation, the Kailuan Coal Mine workers have consciously strived to overcome difficulties, restore production, and implement the People's Government's call to develop production and promote economic prosperity. They truly deserve to be called an excellent force of the Chinese proletariat. However, the capitalist side of the Kailuan Coal Mine not only does not appreciate the workers' enthusiasm for actively developing production and their contributions to rapidly restoring production but also adopts an indifferent attitude towards their lives and safety. They still view the lives of Chinese workers as worthless as those of cattle and horses!
    As early as January 15th, there was already a poisoning incident involving ten workers, including Zhao Kai. This should have been enough to attract the mine's attention. However, driven by the pursuit of profit and disregarding worker safety, they opened the old tunnels, allowing toxic gases to spread. Consequently, in the four days of March 21st, 23rd, 26th, and 27th, the number of continuously poisoned workers, including those from before, reached as many as 103! This situation was not unavoidable, so why was it allowed to happen repeatedly, five times in a row?
    Not only that, but the mine also canceled the post of windmill watchman, leading to a fire in one location that killed worker Guan Heming and injured sixteen employees, including Hu Xuting. The steel cables of the coal transportation tanks had exceeded their safe service life by twenty months without being replaced, almost resulting in an even greater tragedy! Moreover, after each incident, the employees immediately requested basic improvements from the Mining Bureau, but each request was met with no proper response. Furthermore, the medical care for injured workers was very irresponsible. This arrogant attitude of the Kailuan mine owners, who treat workers' lives as a joke and regard the working class as cattle and horses, is a complete violation of the principle of "developing production with benefits for both labor and capital," a violation of the People's Government's decrees, and is intolerable! "Benefits for both labor and capital, developing production" must be a principle that both sides jointly adhere to. The Kailuan Coal Mine workers have consciously and actively overcome difficulties and restored production in a short period, fulfilling their responsibility. However, the Kailuan Coal Mine capitalists still treat today's Kailuan workers with the same arrogant and cruel attitude that imperialists have always held towards the Chinese working class, disregarding the Military Control Commission and the People's Government's decrees. They are not implementing a policy of benefits for both labor and capital but a policy of benefiting capital and harming labor, which cannot but arouse the indignation of all the employees and the broad masses of the people in Tangshan and Tianjin! The Kailuan workers said: "Today, Tangshan has been liberated. All working people should be the masters of society, and capitalists should also turn over a new leaf and be different from the past. However, in the three months since liberation, the attitude of the Mining Bureau towards us employees has not changed at all. They still treat our lives as a joke. For decades, we have suffered too much in our hearts, and today we want to pour out our bitterness!" This statement is entirely correct. We hope that the Kailuan mine owners will change this attitude. The four remedial measures proposed by the temporary representative assembly of the mine's employees on March 29th are correct, and we support this demand and attitude. We hope that the mine's capital side can provide a satisfactory response and immediately improve the mine's safety equipment to effectively protect the legitimate interests and safety of the workers.

　　声援开滦矿工
    今天，我们以极度愤慨的心情，发表唐山开滦煤矿连续发生惨案的消息！
    开滦煤矿工人，在解放之后，自觉地努力克服困难，恢复生产，执行人民政府发展生产繁荣经济的号召，他们真不愧是中国无产阶级的一支优秀部队。但是，开滦煤矿的资本家方面，对于工人方面，这种积极发展生产的热情和迅速恢复生产的功劳，不但不加感谢，反而对于他们的生命安全，采取漠不关心的态度，对于中国工人的生命，仍然是看得象牛马一样的不值钱！
    远在一月十五日，该矿已经有赵凯等十个工友的中毒事件发生，这已经足够引起矿方的注意了。但是，他们只求牟利，不顾工人安全，竟把老塘取开，使毒气传来，遂使三月二十一、二十三、二十六、二十七四天当中，连续中毒者，连前竟达一百零三名之多！这种情况不是不可以避免的，为什么让它一而再、再而三，连续发生五次之多呢？
    不但如此，该矿还因为取消看管风车的里工，有一处发生火灾，烧死工友关鹤鸣一人，烧伤职工胡旭庭等十六名。因为运煤大罐的钢绳已经超过保险期二十个月不加更换，险些出了更大的惨案！而且在每次出事之后，职工都马上向矿务局要求起码的改善，而每一次要求，都得不到应有的回答。而且，工人受伤之后医疗护理也很不负责。这种拿工人生命当儿戏，把工人阶级当牛马看待的开滦矿方的蛮横态度，是完全违反“发展生产，劳资两利”的原则的，是违反人民政府的法令的，是不能令人容忍的！“劳资两利，发展生产”，必须是双方共同遵守的原则。开滦煤矿工人自觉地积极地排除困难，在短期内恢复生产，他们已经是尽到了责任的。但是，开滦煤矿的资本家，却依然以帝国主义者历来对中国工人阶级的骄横惨忍的态度来对待今天开滦的工人，蔑视军管会和人民政府的法令，他们实行的不是劳资两利，而是利资害劳的政策，这不能不引起唐山以及平津全体职工和广大人民的愤慨！开滦的工人说：“今天唐山已经解放了，一切劳动人民，都应该是社会的主人，资本家亦应改弦更张与过去所有不同，但工矿局在解放后的三个多月中间，对待我们职工的态度却丝毫也没有改变，他们仍旧把我们的生命当儿戏。几十年来，我们心里是太苦了，今天要把苦水吐出来！”这话讲得完全对。我们希望开滦的矿方，把这种态度改变过来。三月二十九日，该矿职工临时代表大会提出善后办法四条，是正确的，我们支持这个要求和态度。希望该矿资方能圆满答复，并立即改善矿中安全设备，以切实保障工人应有的利益与安全。
