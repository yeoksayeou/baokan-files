　　Resolving Water Disputes Among Farmers
  　Jin-Gao Canal Implements Segmented Management
  　Jianping Completes the Renovation of Twenty Major Canals
    [JiZhong Electric] The Jin-Gao Irrigation Canal Management Committee, in response to past water disputes among farmers and disasters caused by unauthorized gate openings, has decided to strengthen the organization and management of the canal. Irrigation committee cadres and workers are assigned to specific segments to take responsibility for inspection and patrol. First, in Cuijiazhuang, where canal management is relatively good, the entire village is mobilized. During irrigation, workers are assigned to watch the furrows based on the length of the small canal lines, with five or six workers assigned to each line. Women, the elderly, and children watch the furrows during the day, while able-bodied adults watch at night. This ensures orderly irrigation of land along each line. Village cadres, if too busy with work to participate, are credited with work points. Poor and weak families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers are exempt from work and receive grain and wages. Land in neighboring villages along the same line is also irrigated together, with records kept for final settlement of work points. This reduces water disputes between households and villages, while also greatly saving manpower and water resources. Influenced by Cuijiazhuang, more than a dozen villages along the canal have successively organized themselves and formulated water usage covenants. Farmers in all villages are highly enthusiastic. Dongshilv is repairing new canal lines while irrigating. Wangjiazhuang and Shijiazhuang are releasing water day and night. In highland areas, earth wells are dug and buckets are used for irrigation. All villages are as busy as during the autumn harvest. According to incomplete statistics from ten villages, a total of 2,500 mu of land have already been irrigated.
    [Chahar News] In order to complete the task of increasing grain production by 10,000 shi, Jianping has completely repaired all twenty major canals on both banks of the Hutuo River, and most of them have already released water and begun irrigation. These twenty canals are 224 li in total length. Currently, the masses are diverting water to irrigate wheat and plant early-maturing crops such as vegetables, barley, and beans.

　　解决农民争水纠纷
  　晋藁渠道分段管理
  　建屏修竣廿道大渠
    【冀中电】晋藁灌溉渠管理委员会，因过去农民时有争水纠纷和偷放闸门造成决口灾害等现象，决定加强渠道组织管理，灌溉委员会干部、工人分段切实负责，巡视检查。首先在管理渠道较好的崔家庄，组织起全村群众，浇地时，按小渠线的长短派工看畦浇地，每道可派工五、六人，妇女老头小孩白天看畦，青壮年晚上看畦。这样，一道线的土地能有次序的挨块的灌溉。村干部因工作太忙不能去，也按工计算。贫苦无力的烈军工属，可以不出工不拿工资米。对邻村的地只要在一道线上也一块浇水，记出帐来最后清工。这样，减少了户与户村与村争水纠纷，同时大大节省了人力与水源。在崔家庄的影响下，沿渠的十几个村都先后组织起来，制定了使水公约。各村农民情绪都非常高，东寺吕一面浇一面开修新渠线，王家庄、石家庄昼夜不停的放水，高地挖土井排上斗子浇，各村都和过大秋一样忙碌。据十个村不完全的统计，共已浇地二千五百亩。
    【察哈尔讯】建屏为完成增产粮食一万市石的任务，将滹沱河两岸二十道大渠全部修复，并已大部放水开始灌溉。这二十道渠共长二百二十四里，现群众正引水浇麦，并种菜、大麦、豆子等早熟作物。
