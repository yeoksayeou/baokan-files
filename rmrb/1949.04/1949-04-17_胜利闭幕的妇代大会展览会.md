The Women's Congress Exhibition, which lasted for seventeen days, closed victoriously on the 9th. Over the seventeen days, the average daily audience was around 5,000 people, and right up to the closing, many viewers were still requesting an extension of the exhibition or a travelling exhibition, printed journals, and so on. The enthusiasm of the audience and their feedback and criticisms after the visit demonstrate that this exhibition, like the Women's Congress, was an unprecedented and epoch-making event with great educational significance for the newly liberated people of Beiping!

In the seventeen days, nearly 100,000 people visited, including people from various organizations, groups, military units, women representatives from various regions, students, teachers, housewives, ordinary citizens, female workers, and people from all walks of life. They were all excited and amazed to see in the exhibition hall the situation of women in the liberated areas actively engaged in production, enthusiastically supporting the front lines, and the happy and fulfilling lives of women and children!

The representatives attending the Women's Congress from various regions gained an exchange of experiences after visiting the exhibits from various places, which was of great help to their future work. A North China peasant representative said, "In the past, due to the enemy's blockade and inconvenient transportation between the liberated areas, our vision was limited to a very narrow circle, and we only felt that our region's work was good enough. After seeing so many good things from various places, I realized that there were still many shortcomings in the work of our region. After seeing the situation of machine production, I understood the principle of cities leading the countryside and workers leading the peasants. I also had a deeper understanding of Comrade Deng Yingchao's report."

A Mrs. Wang, a doctor working at the Railway Bureau, said to the reception comrade, "The previous exhibitions displayed exquisite personal artworks, which had nothing to do with us ordinary people, and we couldn't understand them. This time it's different. The things here are all used by our hands, and they are made by everyone, not for viewing, but for use. Look how strong these homespun cloths are, and there are so many patterns."

A housewife, Mrs. Zhong, said, "In the past, not to mention that men looked down on us, even we ourselves thought that women couldn't accomplish great things; after seeing this exhibition, I personally saw women farming, producing, and managing national affairs. I then believed that women are capable, and I realized that only by participating in production can we be respected!"

Gao Youwen, a kindergarten teacher, lingered for a long time in the room displaying photos of children's lives. When she talked to the reception comrade about her experiences, she said, "Before liberation, my husband was a small clerk, and the money he earned was not enough to support a family of four. I had to leave my children at home and go out to teach kindergarten. Every day, I brought other people's children home exhausted, and my own two children were crying from hunger and cold, dirty and wild! Look at the children in the nurseries in the liberated areas, how happy and joyful they are!" As she spoke, she sobbed and cried, leaning on the shoulder of the reception comrade. Many people silently watched her with sympathetic eyes, because she expressed the painful voices of the broad masses of women in the old society!

Thirteen housewives from the Seventh District came and looked in surprise at the photos of sending sons and husbands to the front lines. They whispered, "I used to wonder, if men are sent to the front lines, what will the family eat? After looking at these pictures, I understand that women can also participate in labor, produce to support the family, and the government provides preferential care. Who wouldn't want to! In fact, before liberation, even if men stayed at home, weren't they still being bullied, starving, and unable to make a living?!"

Six large criticism books were filled with writing, with about two thousand people writing down their impressions (or her impressions) after the visit. They recognized the power of liberated women, the power of women's contributions in the ten years of war. Many people changed their incorrect view of treating women as "vases" and understood that women's past ignorance and incompetence was due to the feudal forces hindering the development of their abilities! Most importantly, they realized that women must be completely liberated under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, and they must participate in labor. The words "Labor is glorious" are deeply imprinted in their hearts!

Of course, this exhibition still has shortcomings, such as: lack of comprehensive statistical charts; models and detailed explanations of various products; introductions to the deeds of labor heroes; the struggle process of women's liberation; realistic depictions of women's heroic struggles in the Soviet era, and so on. As the audience expects, we believe that more perfect exhibitions will be held in the future. In the near future, larger and richer exhibitions will be seen everywhere in Shanghai, Nanjing, Hankou, Guangzhou, wherever the People's Liberation Army sets foot.

### 胜利闭幕的妇代大会展览会

　　胜利闭幕的妇代大会展览会
    历时十七天的妇代大会展览会已经在九日闭幕了。十七天以来，平均每天的观众都在五千人左右，并且直到将闭幕时，许多观众还在纷纷要求延长展览日期，或者举行巡回展览，印画刊等等。从观众的踊跃，和他们参观后的反映与批评，可以说明了这个展览会对于新解放的北平人民有着极大的教育意义，和妇代大会一样是空前的，划时代的盛会！
    十七天里，参观的观众将近十万人，有各机关、团体、部队、各地妇女代表、学生、教师、家庭妇女、一般的市民、女工等各阶层的人，她们（他们）眼看着展览室中，解放区妇女积极生产，热烈支前以及妇女儿童愉快幸福的生活情状，都是兴奋赞叹！
    从各地区来的出席妇代大会的代表们，参观了各地的展览品之后，彼此获得了经验的交流，对以后的工作有很大帮助。一位华北农民代表说：“过去因为敌人的封锁，各解放区之间，交通不便，我们的视线被局限于很狭小的圈子里，只觉得自己地区的工作就作得很够了，看了这许多各处来的好东西，才看出自己地区的工作缺点还多得很，看了这些机器生产的情况，我才想通了城市领导乡村，工人领导农民的这个道理，对邓颖超同志的报告也有了更深刻的认识。”
    一个大夫在铁路局工作的王女士对招待同志说：“从前的展览会都是摆的个人的精致的艺术品，跟咱们老百姓没有关系，咱们也看不懂，这回可不同了，这里的东西都是咱们手使的，而且都是大家伙作的，不是为了看，是为了用的。看这些土布多结实，花样也多。”
    一个家庭妇女钟女士说：“从前不用说男人瞧不起咱们，就是咱们自己也以为女人家成不了大事；看了这个会，我自己亲眼看见妇女种地、生产、管理国家大事，我才相信了女人是有能力的，我才明白：只有参加生产，才能被人瞧得起！”　　
    幼稚园的女教师高幼文在陈列儿童生活照片的房里，流连徘徊了许久，当她和招待同志谈起她的遭遇时，她说：“解放前，我的丈夫是小公务员，挣的钱不够养活一家四口，我只得把孩子丢在家里，出去教幼稚园，每天给人家带孩子精疲力尽地回到家里，自己的两个孩子啼饥号寒，又脏又野！看解放区保育院的孩子们，多幸福，多快乐！”她说着抽咽地啜泣起来，俯在招待同志肩上痛哭起来了；许多人默默地用同情的眼光注视着她，因为她道出了旧社会时广大妇女群众的沉痛呼声！
    七区来了十三个家庭妇女，惊奇地看着那些送子送郎上前线的照片，她们悄悄地低语着：“我以前纳闷，送男人上前线去了，一家人吃啥呀？看了这些画，我明白了，女人一样可以参加劳动，生产养家，政府还优待照顾，谁不愿意呀！其实，解放前，就是男人呆在家里，也还不是受气、受饿，过不成日子吗！？”
    六大本批评簿，写得满满的，大约有两千人写出了他们（或她们）的观后感，她们认识了解放了的妇女的力量，认识了十年战争中妇女贡献的力量，许多人改变了把妇女当作“花瓶”的不正确的观点，也明白了妇女过去的无知无能是封建势力阻碍了她们的能力之发挥！最重要的是她们领会到妇女必须在共产党和人民政府领导下，并且必须参加劳动才能得到彻底解放。“劳动是光荣的”这几个字是深深地印在她们心里！
    当然，这个展览会还是有缺点的，象：缺少全面性、综合性的统计图表；各种产品的模型与详细说明；劳动英雄的事迹介绍；妇女翻身的斗争过程；苏维埃时代妇女英勇奋斗的写真等等……。正如观众们所期望的，我们相信以后会有更完美的展览会要举行。不久的将来会在上海、南京、汉口、广州，随着解放军足迹所到之地，到处可以见到规模更大、内容更丰富的展览会。
