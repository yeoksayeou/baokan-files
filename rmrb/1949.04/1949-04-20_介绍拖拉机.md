　　Introduction to Tractors
　　Question: We often hear that our liberated areas will use tractors for plowing in the future, and we are very happy and look forward to using them as soon as possible. However, we only know that this new type of agricultural tool is of great help to the people's agricultural production, but we don't know to what extent. We don't understand. Please introduce its shape, use, the area required for it to turn around, and how much land it can plow every day in detail.
　　Zhao Binwu, Jingxing County
　　Answer: Comrade Binwu: The shape of a tractor is like a small jeep, driven by one person, and uses gasoline. There are many types of tractors. In North China, there are "Allis" and "Ford" brands. The former uses a disc plow, which is installed in the right front and uses thrust to turn the soil. The latter uses a moldboard plow, which is hung at the back and uses pulling force to turn the soil. The Allis brand has 25 horsepower, uses a disc plow, and plows to a depth of six to eight inches. It can plow five mu of land per hour. Assuming eight hours a day, it can plow forty mu of land a day, consuming about 0.4 gallons of oil per mu. The Ford brand has 15 horsepower, uses a moldboard plow, and plows to a depth of four to six inches. It can plow seven mu of land per hour. Assuming eight hours of work, it can plow 56 mu a day, consuming 0.2 gallons of oil per mu. Generally speaking, the former is suitable for land reclamation and deep plowing, and the Ford brand is suitable for shallow plowing on cultivated land.
　　In addition to plowing, tractors can also be used for harrowing, sowing, weeding, and harvesting. If a belt pulley is attached, its power can also be used for pumping water, grinding flour, pressing oil, and ginning cotton.
　　To use a tractor, the terrain must be flat, and the larger the area, the better. It can plow small plots of dozens of mu, but turning is inconvenient, efficiency is low, and fuel consumption is high, which is not cost-effective.

### 介绍拖拉机

专栏：询问与答复

　　介绍拖拉机
    问：我们经常听说，咱们解放区将来耕地要使用拖拉机，心里很高兴，盼望能早日使用。可是只知道这种新式农具对于人民的农业生产帮助效力是很大的，但是到底到什么程度呢？我们不了解，请把它的形状及用途，有多大面积才能容它转动，每天能耕多少地，详详细细的给介绍一下。
　　井陉县赵彬武
    答：彬武同志：拖拉机形状好象小吉普车，由一人驾驶，用的是汽油。拖拉机类型很多，华北有“阿力斯”及“福特”两种牌子的，前者为圆盘犁，装在右前方，用推力翻土，后者为壁犁，挂在后边，用拉力翻土。阿力斯牌的为二十五匹马力，用圆盘犁，耕地深度六英寸到八英寸，每小时可耕地五亩，每天以八小时计，一天可耕地四十亩，耕一亩地约耗油零点四加仑。福特牌为十五匹马力，用壁犁，耕地深度四英寸到六英寸，每小时可耕地七亩，以八小时工作计，一日可耕五十六亩，每亩耗油零点二加仑。一般讲，前者适于垦荒及深耕，福特牌适于熟地浅耕。
    拖拉机除耕地外，耙地、播种、除草、收获等都可以做，如挂上皮带轮还可用它的动力抽水、磨粉、榨油、轧花。
    使用拖拉机要地势平坦，面积越大越好，几十亩小块也能耕，只是转动不便，效力小，耗油多，不上算。
