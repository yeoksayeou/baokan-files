Criticism and Suggestions

　　Yuci West Station Accepts Criticism and Conducts Self-Examination
Editor Comrade:
    Regarding the article published in the People's Daily on March 26th concerning the bureaucratic style of some staff members at our station, we deeply feel after reading it that the fact that Comrades Zhang and Li were able to point out the negative aspects of our station's work style to help us progress and correct our errors is something for which we are sincerely grateful. There are many small units along this railway line. For example, when a train departs, there are station personnel, railway security teams, inspection stations, train crew, and engine crew all working. Among them, there are inevitably individual employees who lack sufficient understanding, whose attitudes are not amiable, who do not earnestly solve problems for the common people, and who stand idly by, exhibiting various negative bureaucratic styles. Not only do the masses hate such negative habits, but our railway personnel should also do their best to correct these bad habits. In the future, in addition to resolutely correcting past negative work styles and actively helping the masses solve problems, we also hope that comrades and fellow villagers will continue to provide more specific suggestions regarding all the errors and shortcomings of our station.

　　榆次西车站接受批评作检查编辑同志：
    关于三月二十六日人民日报登载本站某些工作人员官僚主义作风一稿，我们看后深感张、李二同志能指出本站不良作风，以帮助进步、纠正错误，这种善意实在感激万分。本路各小单位较多，例如某一列车出发之际，有车站、路卫队、检车所、车上乘务及机务等等人员进行工作，其中不免有个别员工，认识不够，态度不和蔼，不给老乡认真解决问题，而且袖手旁观，作出各种恶劣官僚作风，此种恶劣习惯不但群众痛恨，本路人员亦应尽量纠正这种坏作风。今后本站除坚决纠正已往恶劣作风，积极帮助群众解决问题外，尚望诸位同志和老乡们对本站一切错误与缺点继续较具体的多多提示为盼。
