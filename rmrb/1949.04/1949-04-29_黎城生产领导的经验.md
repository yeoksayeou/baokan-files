Li Cheng's Experiences in Production Leadership
    Our reporter Li Wen

    I. Three Situations

    The spring plowing and production in Li Cheng County can be roughly divided into three situations: The first type of village has a relatively good production foundation in the past. The Party branch can form a leadership core. Based on the county Party congress's resolution on increasing production, and combined with the actual situation of the village, it has carried out more detailed discussions and mobilizations, initially inspired the masses' enthusiasm for increasing production, and solved some specific difficulties in increasing production. Some mutual aid groups have been rectified, and some farmer mutual aid groups have formulated or are brewing specific production increase plans. The masses have begun to topdress, etc., and the masses' enthusiasm for increasing production is generally high. The second type of village has convened various meetings, and the Party and the masses have carried out general mobilization for large-scale production, but the integration with the actual situation of the village is poor, and the specific problems in increasing production have not been well resolved. Village cadres are generally active, but they lack specific leadership in production. The third type of village is where the village cadres are negative, cannot form a leadership, and the spirit of increasing production has not been conveyed and implemented, and production is in an unguided, free-flowing state. According to the analysis at the base point village group leader meeting in the fifth and sixth districts, out of the fifty villages in the two districts, seven are of the first type, thirty-three are of the second type, and ten are of the third type.

    II. How to Start?

    The main problems encountered by the county in recent production leadership work are as follows:

    After the county's production mobilization meeting, some cadres went to the countryside only to carry out general production mobilization, simply regarding ideological mobilization as "meeting mobilization," and even believing that as long as the masses' production enthusiasm is high, all specific problems will be solved by themselves. Therefore, they are satisfied with the mobilization of Party member meetings, people's congresses, and other meetings, and the general publicity and discussion of production policies, ignoring how to delve into the masses to discover and solve various specific problems related to increasing production. As a result, the masses have not been fully mobilized, they do not understand the meaning of increasing production, and because specific difficulties cannot be resolved, they are indifferent to increasing production actions such as topdressing. The successful experience of some villages in starting work is: starting from checking spring plowing preparations, focusing on mobilizing the masses to seize the time to topdress wheat, hoe wheat, etc. In some places where there is no habit of topdressing and hoeing wheat, the work team guides the masses to break the masses' concerns about topdressing by discussing examples (such as specific examples of increased grain production due to topdressing in this village) and specifically calculating the pros and cons. And from solving specific difficulties, they inspired the masses' confidence and enthusiasm for increasing production, so that the masses had a concrete understanding of increasing production: "Without topdressing and hoeing seedlings well, increasing production becomes empty talk."

    III. About Production Plans

    The process of formulating a production increase plan is also the process of inspiring the masses' enthusiasm for increasing production. When the Huo Fuchun mutual aid group in Huo Jia Yao, Sixth District, discussed and formulated a production increase plan of topdressing wheat land and increasing fertilizer by five loads for autumn land, at the beginning, the entire group believed that "Our group has a production foundation, and we applied a lot of fertilizer to the wheat land last year, so there is no need to topdress." After discussion, when they realized that topdressing could further increase the yield, they were afraid that "topdressing would lead to a lack of autumn fertilizer." After specifically calculating the existing materials and production conditions of each household, it was actually not very difficult to topdress the wheat land and increase fertilizer by five loads for the autumn land. Some group members said happily: "After this calculation, I dare to topdress." After planning, the goals were clear, confidence was enhanced, and the entire group's production enthusiasm was greatly improved.

    There are two ways to formulate production increase plans in various places: The successful method is that the entire village only generally proposes the current production increase goals, and the formulation of the production increase plan is mainly carried out in each group through full deliberation, starting from typical examples and gradually promoting it throughout the village. According to each person's conditions and abilities, formulate farmer production increase plans, comprehensively formulate group production increase plans based on all farmers' production increase plans, create experience, and then broadcast it throughout the village for promotion. Another method is to allocate production increase figures from top to bottom, and farmers formulate their own plans based on these figures. This top-down method that does not proceed from reality is often prone to formalism.

    IV. Village-Level Leadership Issues

    In recent months' work, two deviations have occurred in how to discover and cultivate active elements in the large-scale production movement: One is that the work team cadres replaced the village-level leadership, ignoring how to help village cadres learn to specifically lead production and improve their ability in daily production activities, so as to fully exert the leadership role that village organizations should play in production; the other deviation is that district cadres only see that some village cadres are negative in leading production, and then take the approach of closing the door to get through the village cadres' thinking, intending to first make these village cadres active, and then lead production. Because the village cadres' thinking is not gradually transformed in the large-scale production action, simply "getting through the thinking" cannot achieve good results. The masses reflect: "Cadres talk about the importance of production all day long, but no one cares about our affairs!"

    Another important issue in village-level production leadership is that most of the village's main cadres are busy with meetings and the village's daily administrative work all day long, which affects their personal participation in mutual aid group production and deepens their leadership in the group (some village cadres also fail to seize the time or are unwilling to deepen into the group to participate in production); some village cadres also serve as production group leaders or hold too many concurrent positions, often delaying work, making their production worse than that of ordinary farmers, which affects the leadership of production. Therefore, how to improve the village-level leadership structure, clarify the division of labor, so that each village cadre can carry out production well, and lead the production of all farmers with production, and systematically cultivate leadership backbones from the production movement is an urgent problem to be solved.

　　黎城生产领导的经验
    本报记者  力文
    一、三种情况
    黎城全县春耕生产的进行，大致可分为三种情况：一类村是过去生产基础较好，支部能形成领导核心，依据县党代会增产决议，结合本村情况，进行了较细致的讨论动员，初步启发了群众的增产热情与解决了增产中的某些具体困难，部分互助组进行了整顿，部分农户互助组已制订出或正酝酿着具体的增产计划，群众已开始上追肥等，群众增产情绪一般很高。二类村已召开了各种会议，党内外进行了一般的大生产动员，但结合本村实际情况较差，对增产中的具体问题尚未很好解决，村干部一般积极，但对生产不会和缺乏具体领导。三类村则是村干部消极，形不成领导，增产的精神尚未传达贯彻，生产是无领导的自流状态。据五、六区基点村组长会议上的分析，两区共五十个村，一类村为七个，二类村三十三个，三类村十个。
    二、怎样入手？
    该县在近来领导生产工作中遇到的几个主要问题如下：
    县生产动员大会后，有些干部下乡只一般的进行生产动员，把思想发动简单的看成为“开会发动”，甚至认为只要群众生产情绪高，什么具体问题都自行解决，因之满足于党员会、人代会等各种会议的动员与对生产政策一般的宣传讨论，忽略了如何深入群众发现与解决有关增产的各种具体问题。致群众未能充分发动，不了解增产意义，加之具体困难不能解决，因之对上追肥等增产行动抱冷淡态度。有些村入手工作的成功经验是：从检查春耕准备入手，有重点的动员群众抓紧上追肥、锄麦等，有些地方没有麦地上追肥与锄麦习惯，工作员便引导群众从讨论实例（如本村某些因上追肥多产粮食的具体事例），和具体计算利害，来打破群众上追肥的顾虑。并从解决具体困难中启发了群众的增产信心与热情，这样使群众对增产有了具体的认识：“不上追肥不好好锄苗，增产便成了空话。”
    三、关于生产计划
    制订增产计划的过程，同时也是启发群众增产热情的过程。六区霍家窑霍富春互助组，在讨论制订麦地上追肥、秋地增肥五驮的增产计划时，开始全组均认为“俺组生产有基础，去年麦地上肥多，不用上追肥。”经过讨论，认识到上追肥更能提高产量时，却又怕“上了追肥、缺了秋肥”。经过按每户现有吧料及生产情况具体计算后，实际上麦地上追肥，秋地增肥五驮并不十分困难。有的组员高兴地说：“这一计算，我敢上追肥了。”经过计划，奋斗目标明确，信心增强，全组生产情绪大为提高。
    各地制订增产计划有两种作法：成功的方法是全村只一般的提出当前增产目标，增产计划的制订主要放在各小组内进行充分酝酿，从典型入手逐步推广全村，根据每个人条件能力，订出农户增产计划，综合全组各农户增产计划，制订小组增产计划，创造经验，然后广播全村进行推广。另一种办法是自上而下的分配增产数字，农户便根据这个数字制订出自己的计划，这种自上而下不从实际出发的办法，常易流于形式。
    四、村级领导问题
    近月来的工作中，对于如何发现与培养大生产运动中的积极分子，曾发生了两种偏向：一是工作组干部代替了村级领导，忽略了如何在日常生产活动中，帮助村干部学会具体的领导生产，提高其能力，以便充分发挥村组织在生产中应起的领导作用；另一种偏向是区干部只看到某些村干部对生产领导表现消极，便采取了关门打通村干部思想的作法，意图首先使这些村干部积极起来，再领导生产。由于不是在大生产行动中逐渐改造村干部的思想，单纯的“打通思想”便不能收到良好的效果。群众反映：“干部整天讲生产重要，却没有谁管俺的事！”
    村级生产领导中的另一重要问题，是大多数村的主要干部，整天忙于开会和村中的日常行政工作，而影响亲身参加互助组生产，深入小组进行领导（也有些村干部是抓不紧时间或不愿深入小组，参加生产）；有些村干部兼任生产小组长，或兼任职务太多，经常误工，使自己的生产不如一般农民，而影响了对生产的领导。因之如何健全村级领导机构，明确分工，使每个村干部都能很好进行生产，且以生产来领导全村农民生产，并从生产运动中有计划的培养领导骨干是目前急需解决的问题。
