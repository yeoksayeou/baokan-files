　　Who is Pulling the Strings?
　　The French Government, Afraid of Messengers of Peace, Restricts the Number of Eastern European Representatives

　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 12th: Reports from various sources: The French reactionary government's Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced on the 9th that the number of representatives from Eastern European countries participating in the World Congress of Supporters of Peace would be limited to eight per country. The French Embassy in Hungary has notified the Hungarian delegation of the above decision. The Hungarian newspaper "Szabad Nép" commented on this, stating that it is not surprising that the French government is afraid of messengers of peace. A few weeks ago, the US government refused to allow Hungarian representatives to participate in the New York Peace Conference. It is not difficult to see the person pulling the strings behind this action of the French government: American imperialism.

  　法政府害怕和平使者竟限制东欧代表名额
    【新华社北平十二日电】各方报道：法国反动政府外交部于九日宣布，东欧各国参加世界拥护和平大会的代表，每国仅以八名为限。法国驻匈牙利公使馆已将上述决定通知匈牙利代表团。匈“萨巴德·涅普”报对此著文评论称：法国政府害怕和平使者，是毫不奇怪的。几星期前，美国政府曾拒绝匈牙利代表参加纽约和平大会。人们不难从法政府的这一行动中，看出幕后的指使者—美帝国主义。
