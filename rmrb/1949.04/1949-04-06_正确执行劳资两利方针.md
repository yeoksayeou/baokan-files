　　Correctly Implement the Policy of Labor-Capital Benefits
Editor's Note: After the successive liberation of cities such as Beiping, Tianjin, Tangshan, and Zhangjiakou, the central task of the Party in these cities is to rapidly restore and develop production, and to transform consumer cities into productive cities. However, to achieve this goal, it is first necessary to correctly implement the policy of the labor movement and protect industry and commerce, and to resolutely combat "leftist" and rightist tendencies in the implementation of these policies. To this end, we are republishing the Xinhua News Agency's "February 7th" memorial editorial from 1948, "Adhere to the Correct Line in the Labor Movement and Oppose 'Leftist' Adventurism," the portion of Comrade Ren Bishi's report from January of the same year concerning the policy of protecting industry and commerce, and the Xinhua News Agency's short commentary from September of the same year, "Correctly Implement the Policy of Labor-Capital Benefits," in succession. These documents point out, on the one hand, the harm of "leftist" errors in the labor movement, which "destroy or reduce production, harm the liberated areas, harm the victory of the war, and harm the construction of a new democratic society, and whose dreadfulness is the same as the Kuomintang bandit gang's 'three alls policy'." On the other hand, they point out the rightist errors that may occur in urban work: "Protecting the legal and legitimate interests of industrialists and businessmen does not mean that we should unconditionally assist their operations that are detrimental to the national economy, nor can we ignore the need to protect the various rights to which workers are entitled." Therefore, it is emphasized that all relevant leading organs should prevent the occurrence of either of the above-mentioned deviations at any time and place, and ensure the correct implementation of the policy of "developing production, promoting economic prosperity, taking into account both public and private interests, and benefiting both labor and capital." These instructions are very beneficial for helping comrades in urban work to better grasp policies and for helping people from all walks of life to further understand our Party's policies, and we hope that all localities will conduct in-depth study in conjunction with the inspection of urban policies.

　　The news about labor-capital relations in Harbin broadcast by this agency today reflects that in the production and construction movement in which the correct policy of "developing production, promoting economic prosperity, taking into account both public and private interests, and benefiting both labor and capital" is being universally promoted in various liberated areas and has achieved remarkable results, some private industrialists and businessmen are distorting government policies and arbitrarily infringing upon the legitimate rights of workers and apprentices and infringing upon the interests of the People's Government in violation of laws and regulations. This situation has also been found in other liberated areas and deserves attention.

　　"Labor-capital benefits" is the basic policy of the new democratic people's government in handling labor-capital relations. The so-called "two benefits" means that in order to achieve the goal of "developing production and promoting economic prosperity," it is necessary to take into account the interests of both labor and capital at the same time, and not to take into account the interests of either labor or capital while ignoring the interests of the other party. In the past, many places have mistakenly overemphasized the temporary interests of the workers and neglected the interests of the capitalists, so that the capitalists had no profit to make, and even mistakenly used the methods of anti-feudal struggle in rural areas to deal with ordinary capitalists. The indirect or direct results of these erroneous actions not only harmed ordinary capitalists, but also seriously harmed the workers themselves. This "leftist" error has been corrected or is being corrected in various places in recent times, and as long as it continues to exist, it will continue to be corrected. However, it is equally important to oppose and prevent another deviation, that is, unilaterally emphasizing the interests of the capitalists, condoning the capitalists' violations of laws and regulations, infringing upon the legal rights of workers without interference, and even sacrificing the basic interests of the workers. This is also a violation of the basic policy of labor-capital benefits.

　　The new democratic government in the liberated areas, in the past, now, and even for a long period of time after the victory of the revolution throughout the country, while resolutely implementing the policy of eliminating bureaucratic capitalism, allows the existence of general capitalist economy and protects all private industries and businesses that are beneficial to the national economy. However, it must be pointed out that what the new democratic government allows and protects is only all capitalist industries and businesses that are beneficial to the national economy, only its legal business operations. If there are elements that undermine the national economy or acts that violate laws and regulations, they will naturally not be allowed to be protected, but should be prohibited and subject to appropriate legal sanctions. Acknowledging that the liberal bourgeoisie occupies a certain position in the economic and political organization of the new democracy does not mean that the economic leadership of state-owned enterprises and the political leadership of the proletariat are eliminated or relaxed, or that the status of capitalists is inappropriately elevated above workers and peasants, oppressing workers and peasants. Protecting the legal and legitimate interests of industrialists and businessmen does not mean that we should unconditionally help their operations that are detrimental to the national economy, nor can we ignore the need to protect the various rights to which workers are entitled.

　　Therefore, in dealing with labor-capital relations, the Party and government leading organs in various places must correctly implement the policy of "labor-capital benefits," and oppose both "leftist" and rightist deviations. It is necessary to protect the interests of workers and appropriately take care of the interests of capitalists; it is necessary to appropriately protect the liberal bourgeoisie economically and politically; but when they have wrong actions that violate the interests of the people and their government, it is necessary to carry out appropriate struggles to ensure that the political and economic development of the country and society follows the correct direction that is beneficial to the entire people. Wherever there are "leftist" errors, workers should be persuaded to take care of long-term interests and correct such errors. In places where capitalists violate policies and regulations, capitalists should be persuaded or ordered to abide by policies and regulations. For a few who refuse to be persuaded and knowingly violate the law or pretend to comply while acting otherwise, the government and relevant parties should take effective measures to deal with them according to the severity of the case. However, at the same time, we must pay attention not to repeat the "leftist" errors, and not to adopt a policy of attacking and destroying the legal operations of small and medium-sized capitalists that are beneficial to the national economy, but to adopt a policy of firm protection. All relevant leading organs should pay attention to preventing the occurrence of any of the above-mentioned deviations at any time and place, and ensure the correct implementation of the policy of "developing production, promoting economic prosperity, taking into account both public and private interests, and benefiting both labor and capital." However, if such two-sided struggles are not carried out in society, and if such two-line struggles against "leftism" and against rightism are not carried out in Party and government organs, then the correct implementation of this policy cannot be guaranteed, the new democratic economy cannot be developed, and either the error of agricultural socialism or the error of the capitalist road will be committed. This is what all Communist Party members and revolutionary cadres must understand. (Xinhua News Agency short commentary, September 21, 1948)

### 正确执行劳资两利方针

　　正确执行劳资两利方针
    编者按：北平、天津、唐山、张垣等城市相继解放后，在这些城市中党的中心任务，是迅速恢复与发展生产，把消费的城市变为生产的城市。但要达到这个目的首先必须正确执行职工运动的方针与保护工商业的政策，与执行这些政策中“左”的和右的倾向作坚决的斗争。为此，我们特将新华社一九四八年“二七”纪念社论“坚持职工运动中的正确路线反对‘左’倾冒险主义”，同年一月任弼时同志报告中关于保护工商业的政策部分，及同年九月新华社短评“正确执行劳资两利方针”等文件，重新陆续发表。在这些文件中，一方面指出职工运动中“左”倾错误危害，它“破坏或降低生产，是危害解放区的，危害战争胜利的，危害新民主主义社会建设的，其可怕的程度是与蒋介石匪帮的‘三光政策’是一样的。”另一方面，又指出了城市工作中可能发生的右倾错误：“保护工商业主合法的正当的利益，并不是说因此就无原则地帮助其不利于国民经济的经营，就可以不注意保障工人应享有的各种权利。”因而着重指出：一切有关的领导机关，应该随时随地防止上述任何一种偏向的发生，保证“发展生产，繁荣经济，公私兼顾，劳资两利”政策的正确执行。这些指示，对于帮助城市工作同志更好掌握政策和帮助各阶层人民进一步了解我党政策，是非常有益的，希望各地结合城市政策的检查进行深入的学习。
    今天本社所广播的关于哈尔滨市劳资关系的消息中，反映解放区各地在普遍推行“发展生产，繁荣经济，公私兼顾，劳资两利”的正确政策并获得显著成效的生产建设运动当中，尚有部分私营工商业主曲解政府政策，任意侵犯工人学徒正当权利和侵犯人民政府利益的违法行为。这个情况在其他解放区也有发现，值得提起注意。
    “劳资两利”是新民主主义的人民政府处理劳资关系的基本方针。所谓“两利”，就是说，为达到“发展生产，繁荣经济”的目的，必须同时兼顾劳资双方的利益，而不能只顾劳资任何一方而不顾对方的利益。过去许多地方，曾经错误地过分强调了工人一方面的暂时利益，忽视了资方利益，致使资方无利可图，甚至错误地搬用农村反封建斗争的方法来对付普通资本家，这些错误行动的间接或直接结果，不但损害了普通资本家，而且更严重地损害了工人本身。这种“左”的错误的偏向，近来各地都已纠正或正在纠正中，只要它继续存在，也还要继续纠正。但是，同样重要的，就是必须反对与防止另一种偏向，即是片面地强调资方利益，纵容资方违法犯纪，侵犯工人的法定权利而不加干涉，以至牺牲工人方面的基本利益。这也是违背了劳资两利的基本方针。
    解放区新民主政府，在过去、现在乃至将来革命在全国胜利以后的一个长时期内，与坚决执行消灭官僚资本主义政策同时，是允许一般资本主义经济的存在，是保护一切有益于国民经济的私营工商业的。但必须指出，新民主政府所允许和保护的，只是一切有益于国民经济的资本主义工商业，只是其合法的营业。如果其中有破坏国民经济的成份，有违反法令的行为，自然不在被允许保护之列，而应受到禁止与法律上适当的制裁。承认自由资产阶级在新民主主义的经济和政治组织中占一定的位置，并不等于取消或放松国家企业的经济领导和无产阶级的政治领导，或者把资本家的地位不适当地抬高到工人、农民之上，压迫工人农民。保护工商业主合法的正当的利益，并不是说因此就应该去无原则地帮助其不利于国民经济的经营，就可以不注意保障工人应享有的各种权利。
    因此，在处理劳资关系问题上，各地党政领导机关，必须正确执行“劳资两利”的方针，反对“左”的和右的两种偏向。既要保障工人利益，又要适当地照顾资方利益；既要在经济上政治上适当地保护自由资产阶级；但当他们有违反人民及其政府利益的错误行为时，又必须进行适当的斗争，才能保证国家和社会的政治与经济循着有利于全体人民的正确方向顺利发展。凡是存在着“左”彻错误的地方，应说服工人照顾长远的利益纠正这种错误，在发生资本家违反政策法令情事的地方，则应劝导或命令资方遵守政策法令。对于少数不服劝导明知故犯或阳奉阴违的分子，则应由政府及有关方面分别轻重依法予以有效的处置。但是同时又须注意，不要由此而又重复“左”的错误，对于一切有益国民经济的中小资本家的合法营业，不采取坚决保护的方针而采取打击破坏的方针。一切有关的领导机关应，随时随地注意防止上述任何一种偏向的发生，保证“发展生产繁荣经济，公私兼顾，劳资两利”的政策的正确执行。但是，如果在社会上不进行这样两方面的斗争，如果在党政机关中不进行这样反“左”与反右的两条战线斗争，那就不能保证这个政策的正确执行，就不能发展新民主主义的经济，就或者要犯农业社会主义的错误，或者要犯资本主义路线的错误。这是一切共产党员和革命干部必须了解的。 　 （一九四八年九月二十一日新华社短评）
