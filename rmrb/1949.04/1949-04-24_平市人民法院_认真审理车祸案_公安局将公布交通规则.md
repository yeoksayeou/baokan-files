  　Seriously Tries Traffic Accident Case
  　Public Security Bureau to Announce Traffic Regulations
    [This newspaper reports] The People's Court of Ping City is actively handling automobile accident cases. The court has accepted more than twenty such cases, large and small. Some of the cases involved minor circumstances. After mediation by the court, both parties voluntarily reached a settlement, with the party responsible for the accident compensating the other party for all losses, and the driver being released on bail pending trial. Certain drivers who violated traffic regulations and caused accidents due to speeding are now being tried according to the law and will be sentenced accordingly. In order to actively eliminate traffic accidents, the Public Security Bureau has drafted traffic regulations, which will be announced soon. Appropriate measures will be taken to address the phenomenon of some people in Ping City still not complying with traffic regulations.
