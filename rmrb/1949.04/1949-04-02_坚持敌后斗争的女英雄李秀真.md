　　Li Xiuzhen, a Female Heroine Who Persisted in Fighting Behind Enemy Lines

　　At the opening ceremony of the First National Women's Congress, the entire hall applauded warmly to welcome an elderly peasant woman to the stage to speak. She was Li Xiuzhen, a representative from the North China Region attending the Congress. This gray-haired heroine had experienced long-term struggles against the enemy and countless hardships. Finally, she had transformed from a slave into the master of the new society and received immense glory!

　　Li Xiuzhen spent her childhood in a poor tenant farmer's family in Dongzhuang Village, Hua County, on the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Plain.

　　She looked forward day and night, and finally, the saviors arrived. After Hua County was occupied by the Japanese devils in 1937, the Eighth Route Army came to this area to fight guerrilla warfare. Li Xiuzhen had joined the Communist Party the year before. She knew that the Eighth Route Army was a team for the poor, and the only way to turn things around was to follow the Communist Party. She immediately joined the war of resistance and did communication work for the troops.

　　When the Japanese devils were in Hua County, she often disguised herself as a superstitious Buddhist granny to burn incense at the City God Temple, scouting the enemy's troop movements. At dusk, she would quietly throw leaflets and various propaganda materials on the sentry posts, main roads, and around the entrance of the enemy headquarters. She calmly went back and forth delivering letters and making contacts.

　　In 1940, the three regiments of Sun Dianying's puppet troops stationed in Dongzhuang Village. She accepted the task from her superiors to open a fried dough stick shop in the village, making contacts with the puppet soldiers to collect and buy bullets to send to the guerrillas. She bought the bullets, tied them around her waist, carried a basket, and pretended to dig wild vegetables in the fields, delivering the bullets to the people's guerrillas.

　　In the summer of 1941, the enemy was about to set out from the city to launch a lightning encirclement against our army, and she was ordered to travel fifty li that day to deliver a letter to our army's stationed village. Li Xiuzhen was a woman with bound feet, and walking fifty li in a day was already very difficult. To make matters worse, she encountered a flood when she reached the Wangsha River. At this time, revolutionary enthusiasm inspired her, and she only thought about resolutely completing the task. In a hurry, she came up with a good idea, clamping the letters in her hair, untying the bullets from her waist and putting them in the basket, and holding a sorghum stalk in her hand, wading through the flood. She fell down and stood up seven times, but never forgot to touch the letters on her head. No danger could stop her from rushing through the flood to advance. When she arrived at the military sub-district office, the comrades in the Eighth Route Army saw that she was as wet as a drowned chicken and quickly told her to change clothes and rest. However, she said, "Don't bother, I have something important!" She took the letters from her hair and handed them to the director of the office. She said, "This isn't much hardship. To have a good life, everyone has to work hard!" She loved the people's army and personally sent her only son to join the army. At the same time, she mobilized fifteen young people to take up guns together.

　　When the Kuomintang reactionaries attacked the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Plain in 1946, the landlord armed forces and local bandits cooperated, harassing, looting, and killing in various villages, arresting the village militia and cadres and burying them alive. Li Xiuzhen was transferred to the sandy area, but soon returned. On the way back, she was caught by an old soldier under the command of Wang Sanzhu, a local bandit leader, who threatened her, saying: "This time, we're going to spread yellow earth and build a yellow covering (note), you can't escape!" During the first interrogation, the enemy took her to a large room, and the local bandit leader asked:

　　"How many years have you been a member of the Communist Party? How many years have you been a cadre?"

　　Li Xiuzhen cleverly did not utter a single true word in front of the enemy:

　　"What do you mean by 'round'? I have been a servant for eight or nine years. When I see pears, red dates, and apples, they are not very round. Only the leather balls that the young masters play with are the roundest. What do you mean by 'dry wood'? I heard that the crossbeam on the South Heaven Gate is the driest. Besides that, what other dry wood is there'!"

　　The enemy was both angry and amused, and re-interrogated her:

　　"I'm asking you if you are a Communist Party member? Is your son an Eighth Route soldier? Tell the truth!"

　　"Every family has sons. Some sons are in the 'Central Army,' and some are in the Eighth Route Army. Are their parents guilty?"

　　The local bandit leader shamelessly tried to deceive her:

　　"Is your son an Eighth Route soldier? The Eighth Route Army has been disbanded, do you know? They are going to be chased into the grasslands to eat atomic bombs. Quickly find your son and bring him back to our side!"

　　"My son was chased into the grasslands! Where can I find him!"

　　"You hurry up and find them, the Eighth Route Army is still in this area!" The enemy ridiculously revealed their trick.

　　"I'm not going, I can't find them, they were chased into the grasslands!"

　　At this time, the enemy terrifyingly pulled out a gun to threaten her: "Do you want your life or not!"

　　Granny Li was not afraid at all. A surge of hot blood rushed to her head, and she said loudly:

　　"My son joined the Eighth Route Army. If his parents are guilty, you can kill us if you want, bury us if you want! I just won't go find him!"

　　The Kuomintang bandit leader saw that she was not afraid at all and said: "This old woman is stupid, she doesn't understand anything!" They detained her.

　　Li Xiuzhen cursed in her heart: "You are the stupid pig, but I am a Communist Party member!"

　　The enemy interrogated her three times in a row and got no confession, so they had to let her go. On the way home, she encountered more than a hundred "Homecoming Corps" riding livestock. Without hesitation, she quickly reported to our army, and the enemy was completely captured.

　　For more than ten years, in the long-term guerrilla warfare, rent reduction and interest reduction, democratic party rectification, land reform, army expansion and production, she always actively played a leading role. Her bold, resourceful, courageous, and persevering heroic deeds represent the brand-new and great personality of rural women in the Chinese Liberated Areas, summoning us to move forward unyieldingly!

　　坚持敌后斗争的女英雄李秀真
    全国第一次妇代大会开幕典礼时，全场代表热烈鼓掌欢迎一个年老的农妇上台讲话，她就是华北区出席大会的代表——李秀真大娘，这位白发苍苍的英雄，经历过长期对敌斗争、千辛万苦，终于，从奴隶变成了新社会的主人，得到了莫大的光荣！
    在冀鲁豫平原滑县东＠城村一个贫穷的佃户家庭，李秀真渡过了她的童年。
    日盼，夜盼，救星终于来了。一九三七年滑县被日本鬼子占领后，八路军开到这一带打游击战，李秀真在前一年就已参加共产党。她知道八路军是为穷人的队伍，要翻身只有跟共产党走，她即参加抗战做了部队通讯工作。
    当鬼子在滑县城里时，她经常假扮成迷信的佛婆子上城隍庙去烧香，侦察敌人的兵力动向。到黄昏时，又把传单和各种宣传品悄悄地扔到岗哨要道上、敌人司令部的门口左右，她沉着地来回送信连络。
    一九四○年，汉奸孙殿英部三旅三个团在东＠城村驻扎，她接受了上级的任务，在村里开了个炸油条铺子，和伪军们连络收买子弹，给游击队送去。她买下子弹扎在腰里，挎着个篮子，假装到地里挖野菜，便把子弹送到人民的游击队里。
    一九四一年夏天，敌人要从城里出发，闪击合围我军，要她当天赶五十里地把信送到我军驻村。李秀真是个小脚妇女，一天走五十里地已是非常困难，更不凑巧的是她走到王沙河边，又碰到发大水，这时，革命的热情鼓舞着她，一心只想着要坚决完成任务，在急忙中，她想出了一个好办法，把信件夹在头发里，将腰里的子弹解下来放到篮子里，手中握一根高粱秸，淌过大水。她七次倒下去又站起来，但时刻不忘用手摸摸头上的信件，一切危险阻止不了她冲过大水前进。当她走到军分区办事处时，八路军里的同志们见她湿得好象一只落水鸡，赶快叫她换衣休息，她却说：“别忙，有要紧事哪”！一边取下头发里的信件交给了办事处主任。她说：“我这不算啥累，要过好日子，就得大家努力才行！”她热爱人民的部队，亲自送自己的独生子参军，同时，动员了十五个青年一同扛起了枪。
    国民党反动派军队在一九四六年进攻冀鲁豫平原时，地主武装和土顽部队配合，到各村骚扰抢杀，逮捕了村里的民兵和干部就活埋，李秀真转移到沙区，不久又回去，半路上被土顽头子王三祝部下的老兵油子逮了去，威吓说：“这次，可是要铺黄铺土，盖黄盖地，（注）你跑不了啦！”第一次审讯时，敌人把她带到一间大屋里，土顽头子问：
    “你是多少年的老党员？多少年的干部？”
    李秀真机智的在敌人面前，不吐出一句真话来：
    “你说什么是圆么？过去我当了八九年的老妈子，见到梨、红枣、苹果都不很圆，只有人家少爷玩的皮球最圆，你说啥是‘干木’？‘我听说南天门上的过木是最干的，除去这，还有什么干木’！”
    敌人又生气，又好笑，重新拷问：
    “我问你是不是共产党员？你儿子是不是八路，快实说！”
    “谁家也有儿子，儿子有当‘中央军’，有当八路军的，他爹娘都是有罪的么？”
    土顽头子无耻的想哄人：
    “你儿子是个八路么？八路解散了，你知道么，要撵他们到草地里去吃原子弹啦，快把你儿子找回到我们这边来！”
    “我儿子撵到草地去了！上那里去找他呀！”
    “你赶快去找他们，八路还在这一带咧！”敌人可笑地露了马脚。
    “我不去，我找不着，他们被撵到草地里去了！”
    这时，敌人恐怖地掏出枪来威吓她：“你要命不要！”
    李大娘毫不害怕，心中一股热血直往上顶，高声说：
    “我儿子当了八路军，他爹娘若是有罪，你们想杀就杀吧，想埋就埋吧！我就是不去找他！”
    国民党匪军头子看她毫不畏惧，说：“这老婆子蠢死啦，啥也不懂！”把她扣押起来，
    李秀真心里骂：“你才是蠢猪，我可就是个共产党员呀！”
    敌人一连审了三次，没有口供，只得把她放了。在回家的大路上，遇见了一百多个“还乡团”骑着牲口走过，她毫不迟疑赶快报告了我军，将敌人完全俘掳。
    十几年来，在长期游击战争里，减租减息、民主整党、土地改革、扩军生产中，她总是积极地起着带头作用。她大胆、机智、英勇和坚忍的英雄事迹代表着中国解放区农村妇女崭新的伟大人格，召唤着我们不屈不挠的前进！
