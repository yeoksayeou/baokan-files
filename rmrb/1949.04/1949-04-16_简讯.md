　　Brief News
　　▲On the three sidings (switches for loading and unloading goods) of Liangxiang Station, there were piles of stones—these were used by the Kuomintang reactionaries when they vainly attempted to "open up" the Pingbao Railway to pave the rails, making it very inconvenient to shunt and hook up cars. After liberation, the railway workers of the station voluntarily requested to clean them up. On the 27th of last month, under the leadership of the staff and workers' union, the station master, clerks, and others also joined the workers in cleaning up. It was estimated to take six days, but it was completed in three days.

　　▲Chen Bibo and other village cadres of Dawen Village, Anguo, wrote and sang fast-clapper rhymes to promote the benefits of planting more cotton and peanuts at the village assembly, which yielded good results. The entire village is preparing to plant 840 mu of cotton, accounting for 20 percent of the total village land area.

　　▲Xue Ji, a disabled veteran and farmer representative from Jifengyao Village, Mixinguan District, Tianzhen, actively led the entire village in repairing canals. It was originally planned to use 180 workdays, but it was completed in 100 workdays. On the 24th of last month, all the land of the revolutionary martyrs' families and military dependents in the village was irrigated in one day. Now the entire village is taking turns irrigating the land. Not only does this village use the water, but it also reversed the decades-old habit of not allowing other villages to use the water. Now it has notified the masses in downstream villages such as Wujiayuan to level the fields and wait for the water.

    ▲良乡车站三股道（装卸货物的道岔子）上，堆满了石子——这是国民党反动派妄想“打通”平保路时用以铺道轨的，甩车、挂车很不方便。解放后，该站铁路工人自动要求清理，上月二十七日在职工分会领导下，站长、司事等也随工友们一齐参加清理工作。预计六天，但三天便完成了。
