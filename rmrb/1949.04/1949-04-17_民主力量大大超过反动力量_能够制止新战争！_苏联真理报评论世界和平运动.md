Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 15th: Moscow Dispatch: Pravda published an article by Z. Dimitrov titled "The Hounds of Anglo-America Oppose the World Peace Movement," stating: A powerful global movement to defend peace and oppose imperialist aggression is unfolding in all countries with irresistible force. This movement has spread to all countries and all nations. There is not a corner of the world where people are not rising up to defend peace. Workers, peasants, and intellectuals in all European countries, the United States, China, and Australia, and even tribes in South Africa, have risen up to support the Paris World Peace Congress. The people's peace movement includes broad progressive intellectual strata in all countries. Regardless of party affiliation or work, they are united by a common desire to defend peace and prevent the recurrence of war terror.

The author emphatically stated that hundreds of millions of people proclaim to the world: no matter how shamelessly capitalist newspapers and magazines lie, no matter how hypocritically the governments of some countries declare that aggressive actions and aggressive pacts are "defensive" in nature, and no matter how various anti-Soviet broadcasts clamor, nothing can deceive them. The huge movement of hundreds of millions of people cannot be suppressed. The attempts by American reactionaries, French police, and even British Labor Party leaders to obstruct working people from participating in the World Congress of Supporters of Peace are both ridiculous and pathetic. They use "communism" to intimidate the timid, and deceive these people by claiming that the World Congress of Supporters of Peace is only attended by Communists and "Communist-controlled groups." However, Anglo-American reactionaries are too late. The movement of the people to defend peace has already taken deep root in all countries, including Britain. The reason why the people's peace movement is so powerful is precisely because it unites the broadest non-Party masses, and because all sincere people around the world hate the murderous plans of the new war instigators and rise up against aggression. The spontaneous power of this people's movement is so great that it attracts all true peace-loving people, regardless of their political and religious beliefs.

After pointing out that many priests and various churches from various countries participated in the World Peace Congress, the author stated: The lies of American imperialism and its lackeys about the "purely Communist" composition of the World Peace Congress are useless. Mothers and wives around the world know that it is the imperialists, not the Communists, who want to use their sons and husbands as cannon fodder again. It is they who, in order to increase profits, want to wash the world in blood, destroy cities, and turn fertile land into deserts.

The author concludes by writing that the seekers of new world hegemony have forgotten the grim lessons of the recent past and have gathered all the dark forces that hate democracy and hate the people under its adventurous banner. However, the forces of democracy far outweigh the forces of reaction. The people have the means to stop the bloodstained hands of the war merchants from strangling the world.

### 民主力量大大超过反动力量　能够制止新战争！  苏联真理报评论世界和平运动

　　民主力量大大超过反动力量
  　能够制止新战争！
    苏联真理报评论世界和平运动
    【新华社北平十五日电】莫斯科讯：真理报刊载季米多夫题为“英美的警犬们反对世界性和平运动”一文称：强有力的世界性保卫和平、反对帝国主义侵略的运动，在世界各国以不可压制的巨大力量开展起来。这个运动已扩及一切国家和一切民族。世界上已没有一个角落的人民不起来保卫和平。一切欧洲国家、美国、中国和澳国的工人、农民和知识分子，以至南非的部落，都奋起拥护巴黎世界和平大会。人民的和平运动包括一切国家的广泛的进步知识阶层。他们不分党派，不分工作，在保卫和平和防止战争恐怖再起的热望下，一致联合起来了。
    作者着重称，数以亿计的人民昭告全世界：无论资本主义的报纸杂志如何恬不知耻地撒谎，无论某些国家的政府如何伪善地宣言侵略行动和侵略公约是“防御”性质，也无论各种反苏的广播如何叫嚣，什么也欺骗不了他们。数亿人民的巨大运动是压制不住的。美国的反动派、法国的警察以至英国的工党领袖们阻挠劳动人民参加世界拥护和平大会的企图，是既可笑又可怜。他们以“共产主义”恫吓胆小的人们，以什么世界拥护和平大会只有共产党和“共产党控制的团体”参加来欺蒙这些人。但是，英美反动派已经太晚了。人民保卫和平的运动已经在一切国家，包括英国在内，扎下了深根。人民和平运动之所以如此强大，正是在于它是团结了最广泛的非党群众，在于全世界一切真诚的人都痛恨新战争挑拨者的杀人计划，起来反对侵略。这一人民运动的自发的力量是如此强大，它吸引着一切真正爱好和平的人，不论他们的政治信仰和宗教信仰如何。
    作者在指出各国许多神父和各种教会参加了世界和平大会之后称：美帝国主义及其走狗们关于世界和平大会的成分“纯粹是共产党的”之谎话，是毫无用处的。全世界的母亲们和妻子们知道，正是帝国主义者而不是共产党，想把他们的儿子和丈夫再次充作炮灰。正是他们为了增加利润，要想血洗世界，毁灭城镇，把沃土变成荒漠。
    作者最后写道，新的世界霸权的追求者忘记了不久以前的严峻教训，把一切憎恨民主、憎恨人民的黑暗势力，结集在它的冒险的旗帜之下。但是，民主的力量大大超过反动的力量。人民有办法制止战贩们伸出来的扼杀世界的血手。
