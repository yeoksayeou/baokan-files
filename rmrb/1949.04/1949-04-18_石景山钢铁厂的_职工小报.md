The "Workers' Little Newspaper" of Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant
Workers run it, workers write it, workers edit it, making it a garden for workers' thoughts, lives, work, and study.
(I) The Birth of the "Workers' Little Newspaper"
In a large-scale enterprise with three thousand employees, at a time when the old reactionary forces had not been thoroughly eliminated and a new revolutionary order was urgently needed, our "Workers' Little Newspaper," shouldering the task of "propaganda, agitation, and organization," was born on January 31st at the foot of Shijingshan. It was difficult to start this publication when material and financial resources were scarce and the masses had not yet been mobilized.

But after two months of effort, we have now moved from pulling workers to write articles to workers organizing communication groups to mobilize the masses to write; from finding workers to help to workers organizing editing groups and stencil groups to participate in the work; from proofreading to mimeographing, from receiving manuscripts to distribution, the workers are doing it all themselves. Workers demonstrate the same proletarian initiative and creativity in this work. And the work team adopts a planned and step-by-step approach to leadership and assistance.

The "Workers' Little Newspaper" (mimeographed, two pages) aims to report and reflect the production, life, and study of all the workers of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant; and to lead, educate, and unite the working masses ideologically, so as to give full play to their consciousness, initiative, and creativity, and to cooperate with the work center in the plant, such as in the inventory work and the handling of bad elements of the Kuomintang. Special issues have also been published. The vast majority of the manuscripts published in the "Workers' Little Newspaper" are written by workers. In the past sixty days, a total of 817 articles have been received, with 241 contributors. The little newspaper has become a garden for workers' thoughts, lives, work, and study. It is now distributed to 370 copies, an average of one copy for every eight people.

(II) How to Mobilize Workers to Write Articles
At first, we went deep into the workers' work areas, dormitories, and rest areas, chatting with them about everything big and small in the factory and at home and abroad, or helping them read newspapers, learn to read, and study documents, integrating with them and establishing relationships with them. Later, we talked about the little newspaper and asked them to write articles. After they wrote them, we would revise them on the spot, pointing out the shortcomings and advantages of the manuscript in a concrete, sincere, and frank manner. We also talked to them about writing methods, telling them how to write and the purpose of writing. At the same time, we listened to their opinions and humbly learned from them. When revising workers' works, we tried to preserve the original words and sentences as much as possible. As long as there were no errors in principle, it was best to revise less or not at all at first, and then gradually improve the quality step by step. If the requirements were too high, no one would dare to write. If we found that the words and sentences they wrote were inappropriate, we would ask them to say it out loud and write it in colloquial language, which was both popular and vivid. This gave the workers the courage and confidence to write. In addition, when talking to them, if we discovered a problem, we would solve it for them on the spot if possible. If it was a big problem, it could be published in the little newspaper the next day. This further strengthened the connection between the little newspaper and the workers, making the workers cherish and rely on the little newspaper even more. As one worker said: "From now on, there is a teacher (referring to the little newspaper) to answer my questions. I have to ask about everything." Another worker said: "Since the little newspaper published the suggestion of 'saving electricity,' the people of Jinding Village have not turned on the night lights. The factory is ours, we must make full use of the little newspaper to praise the good, criticize the bad, and encourage everyone to work." The little newspaper promoted work, strengthened education, and promoted workers' learning of culture. Therefore, less than twenty days after the little newspaper was founded, the problem of manuscript shortage was completely solved, and sometimes the manuscripts could not be used up. However, due to the limitation of space, the manuscripts could not be published one by one. Twenty days after the first issue, there were more than seventy manuscripts in stock, so the workers' enthusiasm for writing declined somewhat. At this time, we publicly solicited copyists in the little newspaper and launched the "Spark" blackboard newspaper campaign, arranged in order of units and number of manuscripts. After the blackboard newspapers were published, the workers saw their own and their co-workers' manuscripts, encouraging and competing with each other. The workers of the transportation department immediately invited thirty-two people to form a "Spark" contribution communication group, and put forward the slogan: "We want to compete with the whole factory to see who contributes the most." "We must respond to the call for everyone to run newspapers and everyone to write articles." Calling up all the workers in the factory. In the factory's inventory work and the support-the-army movement, they wrote a lot of manuscripts and poems, and the workers took the lead.

(III) How is the Little Newspaper Organized?
The Workers' Little Newspaper Society is divided into five groups: communication group, editing group, stencil group, printing and distribution group, and blackboard newspaper group.

The development of correspondents began with the discovery of activists from the submissions, who were hired after interviews. Later, as the preparatory branches of the trade union were established in each factory and department, we reorganized the communication groups, using the original correspondents as the backbone, with each branch as a unit. Now there are fifteen communication groups and one hundred and sixty-two correspondents, scattered in every corner of the steel plant like a spider web.

The editing group currently has six employees participating in the work, recommended by the cultural and educational department of the trade union. During the day, some of them work next to the machines, and some are on duty in the office. In the evening, they run to the little newspaper society at six o'clock to edit the newspaper. In the work, they have explored a set of experience, and set out the editing steps and work logs and manuscript statistics forms, filled in daily, and recorded work experience daily. Three people in a team, take turns to be responsible for editing. In the early stage, the layout was messy, but now the standard layout has been set. As long as the manuscripts are compiled, the number of words can be quickly placed on the page. In addition, the editing group has an attached database, collecting three kinds of newspapers in Beiping and local worker newspapers and ten or so reference books.

The stencil group has seven employees participating. At first, because no one had ever engraved newspaper-type wax paper, the engraving was slow. Sometimes the title and the content were the same size, with no significant difference. Sometimes the words were written too large, exceeding the layout calculation... After three learning sessions of review and research, it is now on track, the size of the words is uniform, and the layout is also clear.

The printing work is done by two workers from the factory's affairs section. If too many copies are printed, the wax paper is easily broken. They try to overcome difficulties and save ink and paper. In the early days of distribution, we personally delivered the newspapers to the workers, helped them read the newspapers, and organized them to elect persons in charge to pick up the newspapers at a certain time every day. Later, the work of picking up and distributing the newspapers was transferred to the branch offices of the trade union. The little newspaper also printed a distribution survey form, which was filled in by each unit, and the form immediately showed who handled each newspaper, how many people there were, and the total number of copies. Now, around 10:00 every day, each person in charge goes to the newspaper distribution office in the workers' club to pick up the newspaper.

From March 8th, the factory's blackboard newspapers were uniformly established by the Little Newspaper Society, which was also done through the trade union branches. The comrades responsible for editing the little newspaper transcribed the important news from the little newspaper with carbon paper after editing it, placed it in a certain place, and the heads of each branch would take it to copy every morning. Seven comrades responsible for copying formed a blackboard newspaper group.

Now, although the "Workers' Little Newspaper" has initially taken shape, there are still many shortcomings in the work, such as the problem of better uniting the staff, the problem of the education of correspondents, etc., which have not been well resolved and need to be worked on in the future.

### 石景山钢铁厂的“职工小报”

　　石景山钢铁厂的“职工小报”
    工人办，工人写，工人编，成了工人思想、生活、工作、学习的园地。
    （一）“职工小报”的产生
    在一个三千职工的大规模企业中，当旧的反动势力没有彻底地肃清，新的革命秩序尚待迫切建立的当儿，我们的“职工小报”，肩承着“宣传、鼓动、组织”的任务，于一月三十一日那天，在石景山下诞生了。在物力、财力奇缺，群众还没有动起来时，办这份刊物，是有着很多困难。
    但经过两月来的努力，现在已从拉职工们写稿，变为职工们组织通讯小组发动群众写稿；从找职工们帮忙，变为职工们组织编辑组、钢版组参加工作；从校对到油印，从收稿到发行，都是职工们亲手去作了。工人在这一工作中同样表现着无产阶级的积极性和创造性。而工作组则是采取有计划、有步骤去领导与帮助。
    “职工小报”（油印两版）以报导和反应石景山钢铁厂全体职工们的生产、生活及学习情况为目的；更从思想上领导、教育和团结工人群众，使高度发挥其自觉性、积极性、创造性，并配合厂内工作中心，如在清点工作、处理国民党员坏分子时，也出过增刊。“职工小报”所刊载的稿件，工人们写的占绝大多数。六十天来，共收到来稿八一七篇，投稿人数二四一人。小报成了工友思想、生活、工作学习的园地。现发行到三百七十份，平均每八人可看一份。
    （二）怎样发动工人写稿
    起先，我们深入工人的工作地区、宿舍及休息场所，跟他们聊天，厂内、国内、大小事都谈，或帮助他们读报、认字、学习文件，跟他们打成一片，与他们建立起感情。以后就谈到小报问题，要他们写稿，写好后，当面删改，把稿的缺点和优点，具体的、诚恳的、坦白的说出来。并和他们讲写稿的方法，告诉他们怎么写，和写稿的目的。同时听取他们的意见，虚心的向他们学习。删改工人作品时，尽量保存原有的字句，只要不犯原则上的错误，开初最好少改或不改，以后，一步一步的从质量上提高，倘若要求过高，谁也就不敢下笔了。如果发现他们写出来的字句不妥当，便叫他们说出来，用口语的字句写上去，又通俗又生动。这样，才给了工人们的写稿勇气和自信心。另外，跟他们谈话时，发现问题了，可能的话，当面就给他解决。如果属于大问题，即可在第二天的小报上发表。这样更加强了小报与工人的联系，使工人更爱惜与依靠小报，如一位工友说：“以后，有先生（指小报）替我解答问题了。有啥事我就得问啥事。”还有一位工友说：“自从小报发表了‘节约电’的建议后，金顶村的人就没有开通夜灯的了。工厂是咱们的，咱们要充分利用小报表扬好的，批评坏的，鼓励大家工作。”经过小报推动了工作，加强了教育，同时推动了工人学习文化。因此小报创刊不到二十天，完全解决了稿荒问题，而且有时稿还用不了。但受篇幅的限制，稿件不能一一刊出，到创刊二十天时，存稿已有七十余篇，因此工人们写稿的情绪，一度低落了些。这时我们就在小报上公开征求抄写人员，发动出“火星”壁报运动，按单位和稿件多少的顺序排列出来。壁报出后，工人们看到自己与工友的稿件，互相鼓励和比赛起来。运输科工友们立刻邀集了三十二人，组织“火星”投稿通讯小组，并且提出口号：“我们要和全厂比赛，看谁投稿最多”。“要响应大家办报，人人写稿的号召。”把全厂工人们都呼唤起来了。在本厂清点工作中、在劳军运动中，他们都写了不少的稿件与诗歌，工人起了带头的作用。
    （三）小报社是怎样组成的？
    职工小报社，下面分有五组，即通讯组、编辑组、钢版组、印刷发行组和黑板报组。
    通讯员的发展，开始是从来稿中发现积极分子，经访问后聘请的。后来各厂处职工会筹备分会成立，我们就以各分会为单位，以原有的通讯员为骨干，重新划分了通讯小组。现在已有通讯小组十五个，通讯员一百六十二人，象蛛网一样，散布在钢铁厂每一个角落。
    编辑组现有职工六人参加工作，由职工会文教部推荐来的，白天，他们有的在机器旁工作，有的在办公室里值班，晚上，六点钟就跑到小报社来编报。在工作中，已摸索着一套经验，定出了编辑步骤和工作日志及稿件统计的表格，逐日的填写，逐日的纪录着工作经验。每三人一班，轮流负责编辑。初期，排版零乱，现在已定出了标准版面，只要稿件编齐，把字一数就很快排上版了。另外编辑组附设了一个资料库，收集有北平的三种报纸及附近各地工人小报和十来本参考书籍。
    钢版组有职工七人参加，开始因都没有刻过报纸型的腊纸，刻的慢，有时标题和内容字迹一般大，没有显著的分别，有时字写的过大，超出排版计算……经过三次学习会的检讨和研究，现已上了轨道，字大小均匀，版面也明显了。
    印刷工作，由厂方事务科二位工友同志担任，份数印的太多，腊纸容易破，他们设法克服困难，节省了油墨、纸张。发行工作，初创办时，我们亲手交到工友们的手中，帮助他们读报，并且把他们组织起来，推举负责人于每天一定时间取报。后来取发报的工作，都转交给各职工会分会办理。小报社还印制一种发行调查表，由各单位自行填写，在表中，立刻可看出每份报纸由谁经手取，有多少群众，总份数多少等。现在每天十时左右，各负责人都到职工俱乐部本报发行处取报。
    从三月八日起，全厂的黑板报，由小报社统一的建立起来了，这也是通过各职工分会去做的。负责编辑小报的同志，编完报后，将小报上重要的消息用复写纸誊好，搁在一定的地点，每天清早由各分会负责人自行取去抄写。由七位负责抄写的工作同志，组成了一个黑板报组。
    现在“职工小报”虽已初具模型，但在工作中仍存在很多缺点，如关于更好的团结职员的问题，通讯员的教育问题等等还未有很好解决，尚待今后努力。
