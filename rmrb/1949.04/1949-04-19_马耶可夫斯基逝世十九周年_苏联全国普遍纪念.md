Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 17th: Moscow, April 15th – The Soviet Union is universally commemorating the nineteenth anniversary of the death of the great Soviet poet Vladimir Mayakovsky. The Soviet Writers Publishing House has specially published a new book, "Mayakovsky on America," which collects many things Mayakovsky wrote about what he saw during his trip to the United States in 1925. Mayakovsky vividly and profoundly revealed the true essence of American bourgeois society, exposing the internal contradictions of this society nakedly and revealing its hypocrisy and obstinacy. Mayakovsky pointed out that there are two Americas: the America of the exploiters and the America of the exploited.

Mayakovsky's works in the Soviet Union have been published in forty-seven languages, totaling 11,244,000 copies. His complete works have also been published in large quantities several times. Another version of Mayakovsky's complete works will be released this year. This version will include some recently issued poems and essays that he published in newspapers and magazines during his lifetime. A selection of Mayakovsky's works will also be published this year. In the Soviet Union, many of Mayakovsky's poetry collections, which are extremely popular with readers, are published almost every year. One of Mayakovsky's best poems, "Vladimir Ilyich Lenin," has been published thirty-four times in Russian, Ukrainian, Uzbek, Georgian, Hungarian, Finnish, German, and other languages, with a total of 952,000 copies, and another 250,000 copies are now to be published.
