Breakfast is rice porridge and pickles, and the other two meals are fine grains, with three vegetarian dishes and one meat dish per table. Two single dormitories have been prepared, accommodating sixty to seventy people. The Telephone Bureau also established a staff canteen on April 1st. Administratively, it helped build the dining hall and kitchen, provided all the necessary furniture, and subsidized the mess hall with 110 catties of millet per month. The general affairs section was designated to assist in organizing the accounts, and food items such as rice, flour, oil, and salt were purchased in bulk by the cooperative to reduce the burden on the employees who joined the canteen.
