　　Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Introduction
　　A brief reply to readers Yuchi and Xue Jun
　　On August 9, 1945, the Soviet Union declared war on Japan. People in various parts of Inner Mongolia rose up in response and organized the Inner Mongolia People's Self-Defense Army and Autonomous Army (now forming the unified Inner Mongolia People's Liberation Army) to fight against Japan in cooperation with the Soviet Red Army and the Chinese People's Liberation Army. In November of the same year, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Movement Organization United Association was established in West Mongolia, and in December, the East Mongolia Autonomous Government was established in East Mongolia. On April 3, 1946, with the help of the Chinese Communist Party, representatives from East and West Mongolia held a meeting in Chengde, Rehe, and unanimously agreed that the people of Inner Mongolia should implement an autonomous movement. Various autonomous movement organizations in East and West Mongolia were unified under the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Movement United Association, with Yunze (alternate member of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party), a leader of the Inner Mongolian people, as chairman and Boyan Mandu as vice chairman. On May 1, 1947, the Inner Mongolian people held a representative assembly in Wangye Temple, passed the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Government's policy program and organizational law draft, legally produced the Inner Mongolia Provisional Senate, and elected Boyan Mandu as the speaker and Yunze as the chairman of the Autonomous Government. On May 5, the Autonomous Government announced its establishment and decided that Wangye Temple (now changed to Ulanhot City) would be the capital of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.
　　The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region's local administrative regions are divided into four levels: (1) League (province), (2) Banner (county), (3) Nutuk and (Mu District), (4) Su'airi, Gacha and Baga (township or administrative village). The entire territory of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region includes the leagues and banners of Mongolian ethnic groups in the Northeast and within Rehe, Chahar, Suiyuan, and Ningxia. In the Northeast, there are six leagues including Jerim, Josutu, Jao Uda, Hinggan, Navin Morin, and Hulunbuir, generally known as East Mongolia. Within Chahar, Suiyuan, Rehe and Ningxia there are six leagues and tribes including Xilin Gol, Ikezhao, Ulanqab, Chahar, Bayannur and Xia Mongolia, generally known as West Mongolia. In total there are twelve leagues and seventy-nine banners. The total area of the region is approximately 1.5 million square kilometers, with a population of approximately 11.4 million or more.

    一九四五年八月九日苏联对日宣战，内蒙各地人民纷纷起而响应，并组织了内蒙人民自卫军、自治军（现在已组成统一的内蒙古人民解放军），配合苏联红军及中国人民解放军对日作战。同年十一月在西蒙成立了内蒙古自治运动组织联合会，十二月在东蒙成立了东蒙古自治政府。一九四六年四月三日，在中国共产党的帮助下，东西蒙代表在热河承德开会，一致通过内蒙古人民实行自治运动，东西蒙各种自治运动组织均统一于内蒙自治运动联合会，以内蒙人民领袖云泽（中国共产党候补中央委员）为主席，博彦满都为副主席。一九四七年五月一日，内蒙人民举行代表大会于王爷庙，通过内蒙自治政府施政纲领及组织法草案，依法产生了内蒙临时参议会，选出博彦满都为参议长，云泽为自治政府主席。五月五日自治政府宣布成立。并决定王爷庙（现在已改为乌兰浩特市）为内蒙自治区的首都。
    内蒙自治区地方行政区分为四级：（一）盟（省）、（二）旗（县）、（三）努图克及（木区）、（四）苏爱里、嘎查及八嘎（乡或行政村）。内蒙自治区全境包括东北及热河、察哈尔、绥远、宁夏境内蒙古民族的各盟旗。在东北的有哲里木、卓索图、昭乌达、兴安、纳文慕仁及呼伦贝尔等六盟，一般称为东蒙。在察、绥、热、宁境内的有锡林郭勒、伊克昭、乌兰察布、察哈尔、巴彦塔拉宁及夏蒙古等六盟部，一般称为西蒙。总计十二个盟部，七十九个旗。全区面积约一百五十万平方公里，人口约一千一百四十万以上。
