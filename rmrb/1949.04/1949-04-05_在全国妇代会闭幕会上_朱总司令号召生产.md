　　At the Closing Ceremony of the National Women's Congress
  　Commander-in-Chief Zhu Calls for Production
    [This Newspaper's Report] Commander-in-Chief Zhu De of the Chinese People's Liberation Army delivered a speech at the closing ceremony of the First National Women's Congress of China (April 3rd), the summary of which is as follows:
    The First National Women's Congress of China is of particular and great significance, marking the victory of the people nationwide and the new development of the women's movement.
    For many years, Chinese women, especially the vast number of working women, have been under the rule of feudalism, imperialism, and bureaucrat-capitalism, suffering from numerous persecutions. They had no independent social status and became objects of exploitation and manipulation. Only by completely destroying the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang can Chinese women achieve complete liberation. In the liberated areas, the oppressed and enslaved state of women has been fundamentally changed. Many women have participated in the work of the people's government, the land reform work, and the production movement. Under the people's government, they are achieving a position of equality with men in politics, economy, culture and education, and marriage issues. In factories and in various professional positions, the principle of equal pay for equal work for men and women has been implemented.
    Now that the day of complete victory for the Chinese people is fast approaching, the task of building a new China is before us. To this end, we must strive to restore and develop production. After overthrowing the reactionary Kuomintang regime, developing production is not only of decisive significance for the progress of Chinese society, but also of decisive significance for improving the social status of women. Only by actively participating in the production process can women achieve truly independent economic status. The first priority of production is industrial production. The focus of the entire Chinese revolutionary work has shifted from the countryside to the cities, and the focus of women's work should also shift to the cities, without neglecting the rural work, and should especially strengthen the work of female workers.
    In mobilizing and organizing women for production, we should not ignore the special difficulties and demands of women themselves, such as implementing freedom of marriage and developing childcare services.
    China's peace and world peace are necessary for the happy life of the Chinese people in the future, and also a guarantee of the fundamental interests of Chinese women and children. Domestically, we must follow Chairman Mao's eight peace proposals to achieve genuine peace and oppose false peace. Internationally, today the people of the whole world are uniting to oppose the aggressive bloc headed by US imperialism. It is hoped that the representatives attending the meeting will return to their respective regions, unite and call on the masses of women across the country to rise up, strive for genuine peace in China, and defend lasting peace in the world.

　　在全国妇代会闭幕会上
  　朱总司令号召生产
    【本报讯】中国人民解放军朱德总司令前（四月三日）在中国妇女第一次全国代表大会闭幕会上的讲话摘要如下：
    中国妇女第一次全国代表大会是有着特殊重大意义的，它标志着全国人民的胜利，和妇女运动的新发展。
    许多年来，中国妇女，特别是广大劳动妇女，一直处在封建主义、帝国主义、官僚资本主义的统治之下，遭受着重重的迫害。她们没有任何独立的社会地位，成为被剥削被玩弄的对象。只有彻底摧毁国民党反动的统治，中国妇女才能得到完全的解放。在解放区妇女被压迫被奴役的状态已经根本改变了，很多妇女参加了人民政权的工作、土地改革的工作和生产运动。在人民政权下，她们在政治上、经济上、文化教育上、婚姻问题上，都正在取得与男子平等的地位。在工厂里，在各种职业岗位上，实现了男女同工同酬的原则。
    现在中国人民完全胜利的日子很快就要到来，建设新中国的任务，已摆在我们面前，为此必须努力恢复和发展生产。在推翻反动的国民党政权之后，发展生产，不仅对中国社会前进有决定的意义，而且对提高妇女社会地位也有着决定的意义。妇女只有在积极参加生产过程中，才能取得真正独立的经济地位，生产事业的第一位是工业生产。整个中国革命工作重心已经由乡村转到城市，妇女工作重心亦应在不忽视乡村工作的条件下转入城市，并应特别加强女工工作。
    在动员与组织妇女生产中，不应忽视妇女本身所具有的特殊困难和要求，如贯彻婚姻自由，开展儿童保育事业等。
    中国的和平与世界的和平，是今后中国人民幸福生活所必需，也是中国妇女与儿童根本利益的保障。在国内，我们必须按照毛主席的八项和平主张，实现真正的和平，反对假和平。在国际，今天全世界的人民，正在团结起来，反对以美帝国主义为首的侵略集团。希望到会的代表回到各地，团结和号召全国妇女群众起来，争取中国的真正和平，保卫世界的持久和平。
