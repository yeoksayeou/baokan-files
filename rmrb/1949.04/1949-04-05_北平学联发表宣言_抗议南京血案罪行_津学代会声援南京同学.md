　　Peiping Student Union Issues Declaration Protesting Nanjing Bloodshed Crimes
　　Tianjin Student Congress Supports Nanjing Students
　　[Report from this newspaper] The Peiping Student Union, protesting the Nanjing reactionary government's massacre of students, issued a declaration yesterday (the 4th), pointing out that this tragedy once again proves the reactionary faction's conspiracy of fake peace. A year ago, the bloody traces of the 4/9 Normal University massacre during the Peiping students' anti-hunger movement were still visible. Today, the blood of Nanjing students striving for peace has stained the land south of the Yangtze River red. The persecution of Peiping students by the Kuomintang reactionaries could not stop the liberation of Peiping. Similarly, their massacre of Nanjing students cannot stop the heroic advance of the Chinese people against false peace and demanding true peace. The declaration concludes with firm belief: the unanimous demand of the Chinese people will surely achieve final victory!
　　[Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 4th] The first Tianjin Student Congress, currently in session, to protest the Nanjing Kuomintang reactionary government's bloody crimes of beating and killing students, and to support the just action of Nanjing students demanding true peace, telegraphed Nanjing students on the 2nd, saying: We represent the 40,000 students of Tianjin in expressing our full support to you. We hope that you strengthen your unity and strive to thoroughly defeat the Kuomintang reactionaries and establish a New Democratic China throughout the country.

　　北平学联发表宣言　抗议南京血案罪行
  　津学代会声援南京同学
    【本报讯】平市学生联合会抗议南京反动政府屠杀学生，于昨（四日）发表宣言，指出这一惨案再一次证明了反动派假和平的阴谋。一年前，北平同学反饥饿运动中四九师大惨案的血迹斑斑，今天，南京同学争取和平的鲜血染红了江南的土地。国民党反动派对北平同学的迫害阻止不了北平的解放。同样的，他们对南京同学的屠杀也阻止不了中国人民反对假和平要求真和平的英勇进军。宣言最后坚定地相信：中国人民的一致要求，一定会得到最后胜利！
    【新华社天津四日电】正在开会的天津学生第一届代表大会为抗议南京国民党反动政府打死打伤学生的血腥罪行，和声援南京学生要求真和平的正义行动，于二日致电南京学生说：我们代表天津四万同学向你们表示，我们全力支援你们，希望你们加强团结，为彻底打垮国民党反动派，在全国范围内建立新民主主义的中国而奋斗。
