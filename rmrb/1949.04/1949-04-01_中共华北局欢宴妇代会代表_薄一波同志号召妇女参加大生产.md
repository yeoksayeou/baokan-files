    The CCP North China Bureau Hosts a Banquet for Women's Congress Representatives
    Comrade Bo Yibo Calls on Women to Participate in the Great Production

    [Our Newspaper] The CCP Central Committee North China Bureau, the North China People's Government, the North China Military Region Headquarters, the Beiping Military Control Commission, the CCP Beiping Municipal Committee, the Beiping People's Government, and the Beiping Garrison Headquarters hosted a banquet for all the representatives of the Women's Congress at 6 p.m. on the 30th.

    After all the representatives were seated, Comrade Bo Yibo of the North China Bureau delivered a speech. He began by saying: "Everyone feels very excited to hold such a grand national women's representative conference in the ancient cultural city of Beiping today. But the reason we can hold it here is that we should think about the past. First of all, it is because the Chinese Communist Party, the leader of the Chinese revolution, pointed out a correct path for us. Without this correct path, the revolution would not be victorious. Secondly, it is due to the heroic and skillful fighting of the powerful People's Liberation Army, as well as the efforts and struggles of all the people." Comrade Bo Yibo highly praised the great contributions of Chinese women, especially women in the liberated areas, to the Chinese revolution: "The broad masses of women and women cadres, like men, actively participated in the land reform, which gave the liberated areas a new look. After the land reform, more than two million farmers enthusiastically went to the front lines to join the People's Liberation Army. The political consciousness of women in the liberated areas has been unprecedentedly enhanced. Touching deeds of mothers sending their sons and wives sending their husbands to the front lines can be seen everywhere. Not only that, the most important thing is that women gloriously took over the work left behind by the men who went to the front lines, and universally participated in agricultural and sideline production, and handicraft production. So many young and middle-aged men joined the army and went to war, but it did not reduce production in the liberated areas. This should be attributed to the enthusiasm of women in production. Women's participation in production, from not participating to actively participating, is a revolutionary process. Because they participated in production, their political status has been greatly improved. In the three major movements of land reform, production movement, and supporting the front, women have made significant contributions. If women had not participated in these three major movements, the victory of the People's Liberation War would have been unimaginable." Finally, Comrade Bo Yibo emphasized: "The past contributions were great, but that is all in the past. In the future, when we turn to construction, we should do more. We have now entered the cities, and to do a good job in urban work, we must first do a good job in production. Many cities in the past, under the rule of imperialism and the Kuomintang, were merely consumer cities, with few producers and many consumers. We must transform consumer cities into production cities. Only in this way can the people's regime be maintained and consolidated. Eliminating the reactionary faction of Chiang Kai-shek and the Kuomintang is a great project, and building an industrialized China will be an even greater project. Representatives! You should call on and organize women to participate in the great production movement together. Only by turning over in production can China truly turn over. Women should still participate as actively as before in the great production movement. Any great revolution, without the participation of women, is a lame one. I believe that women comrades will not lag behind in the construction of the new China."

    Zhao Zhixuan, a representative of the Northeast delegation, delivered a speech of thanks on behalf of all the representatives, and the banquet ended happily around 8 p.m.

　　中共华北局欢宴妇代会代表
  　薄一波同志号召妇女参加大生产
    【本报讯】中共中央华北局、华北人民政府、华北军区司令部、北平军管会、中共北平市委、北平人民政府、北平警备司令部七单位，三十日晚六时欢宴妇代会全体代表。
    当全体代表入座后，华北局薄一波同志即席致辞，他首先说：今天我们在文化古都北平开这样盛大的全国性的妇女代表会议，人人感到十分兴奋，但我们所以能够在这里开，就应该想想过去，这首先是由于中国革命的领导者中国共产党给我们指出了一条正确的道路，没有这一条正确的道路，革命是不会胜利的。其次是由于强大的人民解放军的英勇善战，以及全体人民的努力奋斗的结果。一波同志盛赞中国妇女特别解放区的妇女在中国革命中的伟大贡献：广大妇女群众和妇女干部，她们和男子一样积极地参加了土地改革，使解放区焕然为之一新。土地改革以后，曾经有二百多万农民踊上前线参加了人民解放军。解放区的妇女们政治觉悟空前提高，母亲送儿子与妻子送郎上前线的动人业迹，随处可见。不仅这样，最重要的还是妇女光荣地接替了走上前线的男子所遗留的工作，普遍地参加了农业和副业生产、手工业生产。有这样多的青壮男子参军、参战，而并没有使解放区的生产降低，这首应归功于妇女生产的积极性。妇女从不参加生产到积极参加生产，是个革命的过程。由于她们参加生产了，所以她们在政治上的地位也就大大提高了。在土地改革、生产运动、支援前线三大运动中，妇女们都有重大贡献，假如没有妇女参加这三个大运动，人民解放战争的胜利也是不可想象的。最后，一波同志强调的指出：过去的贡献是很大的，但那都是过去的了，今后我们转入建设的时候，我们应该做的事情则更多，我们现在已经进入城市，要把城市工作做好，首先要把生产工作做好。许多城市过去在帝国主义国民党统治下，仅仅是一个消费城市，生之者寡，食之者众，必须把消费城市变为生产城市，只有这样，人民政权才能维持，才能巩固。消灭蒋介石国民党反动派，是一件伟大的工程，建设一个工业化的中国，将是一个更伟大的工程。代表同志们！应该号召组织妇女同胞，一齐来参加大生产运动，只有生产翻身，中国才能够真正翻身，妇女在伟大的生产运动中，仍应和以往一样积极参加。任何伟大的革命，如果没有妇女参加，则是一个跛脚子，相信妇女同志们在新中国的建设中决不会落后。
    东北代表团赵志萱代表全体代表致答谢词，至八时许，尽欢而散。
