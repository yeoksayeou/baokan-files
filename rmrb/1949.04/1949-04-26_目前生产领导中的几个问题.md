　　Several Problems in the Current Production Leadership
    The Taihang District Party Committee Office:
    In the past month, various localities have successively adopted methods such as county, district, and village cadre meetings, Party representative meetings, and labor hero meetings to carry out widespread and in-depth mobilization among the masses. A vigorous and surging mass production movement is being enthusiastically launched. The production enthusiasm of the masses is truly unprecedented in recent years. This is the result of land rights being determined and rewarding farmers for their hard work and prosperity after the completion of land reform. With the high production enthusiasm of the masses, coupled with the strong leadership of the Party and the government, it is entirely possible to successfully complete the task of increasing agricultural production by 10% in 1949. However, there are several problems in the current production leadership. The following opinions are provided for reference by various localities:
    (1) Cherish the valuable production enthusiasm of the masses, earnestly strengthen leadership, and oppose all forms of laissez-faire.
    Some comrades believe that after finishing land reform and Party rectification, they have been busy for a year, and now that the masses have great enthusiasm for production, they should relax and rest. They do not provide leadership for mass production. This is an old mentality of idleness and laziness at work. They do not understand the arduous task of long-term production and construction in the future. Without the strong leadership of the Party, production and construction cannot be successful. At the same time, if the Party does not actively lead the masses in production, it will inevitably become detached from the masses. Therefore, this kind of thinking should be strictly criticized and corrected in a timely manner. There are also some comrades who believe that the masses know how to produce, and they are very enthusiastic, so what else does the Party need to lead? For this part of the comrades, the leadership should provide more patient and specific help, instructing them on the content of leading the masses in production, frequently summarizing and introducing some specific experiences, so that they can gradually learn to lead the masses in production in practice.
    In addition, many comrades are doing the right thing. They cherish the enthusiasm of the masses for production, go deep into the masses, understand the problems in production, patiently dispel the ideological concerns of the masses about developing production, help overcome difficulties in production, formulate plans for getting rich, organize production competitions, commend labor models, and disseminate technical knowledge. The work attitude of these comrades should be commended. Comrades who do not know how to lead production should learn from them.
    (2) Ending land reform, Party rectification, and other work must be carried out around production, and the order must not be reversed.
    Carrying out a large-scale production movement is the overriding central task for the future. The District Party Committee emphasized this point at its February meeting. However, it has recently been discovered that individual counties have disregarded the Party's instructions and ignored the urgent production demands of the masses. In terms of the use of forces and the focus of work, they continue to regard ending land reform and Party rectification as the overriding central task, aiming to strive for the unified completion of land reform and Party rectification throughout the county before starting to fully lead production, resulting in considerable losses to the production movement. This kind of practice of independence from the Party and the masses is obviously wrong and must be corrected. The order of central and non-central work must not be reversed. However, there is another kind of deviation, namely, believing that since production is already the center of all work, other problems need not be addressed anymore. For example, in some villages during Party rectification, the masses raised many opinions to the Party members, but they were not distinguished and dealt with in the end. Some problems did not conform to the facts, and both Party members and the masses were dissatisfied. The relationship between the Party and the masses was not further strengthened, and no one cared about production in the village. Both of these deviations need to be overcome.
    (3) Guarantee the realization of the production plan.
    Regarding the development of agricultural production, all counties have formulated annual struggle plans and called on the masses to strive for their realization, which is very good. However, we have found that the plans formulated by various localities have a common major shortcoming, that is, how to ensure that the plan can be effectively realized, and what necessary steps and methods should be taken are rarely seen. For example, one county's plan mentioned that it is necessary to increase the number of livestock by 4,000 in 1949, but how to increase it? What is the purchasing power of the masses? How much can bank loans help? How many female livestock are there in the county? How many livestock breeding stations need to be set up? Not a word was mentioned. This inevitably makes people worry that the plan will fail. Therefore, various localities should not be satisfied with the plans that have been formulated, but should review them again, carefully discuss the effective steps and methods for their realization, and then strictly check and supervise them, so as to ensure their realization.
    (4) Concretely strengthen the activities of rural branch members in production and correct unrealistic empty talk.
    In the production movement of the past few years, there is a valuable experience, that is, only when rural Party members truly become the most outstanding laborers and active leaders of mass production in the production movement, does it have a decisive significance for inspiring the production enthusiasm of the masses. This is especially obvious after Party members are made public. For example, when Communist Party members Li Shunda, Xiang Tishui, and Shi Cun Jin became labor heroes, the masses in the whole village under their leadership were also full of vitality. All Party members in the district should learn from this living example. Therefore, making the branch a strong leading core for mass production and making each Party member the most outstanding laborer on the production front is the best way to persuade the masses to respond to the Party's policies.
    However, some places, ignoring the above situation, are only focused on giving empty talks to the masses about "working hard in production to support the national war" and "two futures," etc. As a result, not only does it waste the masses' extremely valuable labor time (some masses have already protested by not participating in such meetings. Our bureaucrats also say that the masses are backward), but it also adds many new confused thoughts to the masses (such as fear of burden, fear of communism, etc.). This should be corrected immediately.

### 目前生产领导中的几个问题

　　目前生产领导中的几个问题
    太行区党委办公室：
    月来各地先后采用了县区村扩干会议、党代表会议、劳动英雄会议等方式，在群众中进行了普遍深入的动员，一个蓬勃高涨的大生产运动，正在热烈开展。群众的生产积极性实为历年来所罕见，这是完成土地改革后，地权确定，奖励农民勤劳致富的结果。群众的高度生产热情，再加以党与政府的有力领导，胜利的完成一九四九年农业增产一成的任务，是完全可能的。但目前生产领导上，存在着几个问题，特提供如下意见，供各地参考：
    （一）宝贵群众生产热情，认真加以领导，反对一切自流主义
    有些同志认为，结束土改整党，忙了一年，现在群众生产劲头又很大，我该松口气，休息一下了。对群众生产，不加领导。这是一种游闲偷懒的旧意识在作怪。不了解今后长期生产建设的艰巨任务，如没有党的坚强领导，生产建设是不可能搞好的。同时党如不积极领导群众生产，也必将脱离群众。因此对上述想法，应该给以严格批评，及时纠正。还有一种同志认为：生产吗？群众都会，劲头又都很高，还有什么事情需要党去领导呢？对这部份同志，领导上应更多的耐心的去给以具体帮助，指示他领导群众生产的内容，勤总结介绍一些具体经验，使之在实践中，逐渐学会领导群众生产。
    另外，有许多同志是作的对的。他们非常珍贵群众生产的热情，深入到群众中去，了解生产中的问题，耐心地解除群众发展生产上的思想顾虑，帮助克服生产中的困难，订出发家计划，组织生产竞赛，表扬劳动模范，传播技术知识，这些同志的工作态度是应该加以表扬的。不会领导生产的同志，应向他们学习。
    （二）结束土改整党等工作，必须围绕生产进行，不容倒置
    开展大生产运动是今后压倒一切的中心工作，区党委二月会议上曾强调过这点；但近来发现个别县份，竟不顾党的指示，不理群众急迫的生产要求，在力量使用上，工作重点上，还继续把结束土改整党工作作为压倒一切的中心，目的在争取全县结束土改整党工作整齐划一后，再开始全力领导生产，致生产运动蒙受了不小损失。这种对党对群众闹独立性的作法，显然是错误的，必须扭正过来，不容把中心与非中心工作倒置。但还有另一种偏向，即认为生产既已为一切工作中心，其他问题当可不必再理了。例如有些村在整党中，群众给党员提了不少意见，最后未加分辩处理；有些问题不符事实，党员群众都不满，党群关系未进一步密切起来，村里生产无人理。这两种偏向都需克服。
    （三）保证生产计划实现。
    关于发展农业生产，各县都订出了全年奋斗的计划，并号召群众为其实现而努力，这是很好的。但我们发现，各地所订的计划，有一个普遍的大缺点，即如何保证计划能够有效的实现，应该采取些什么必要的步骤与方法，则很少见到。例如有一个县的计划中提到：要在一九四九年内增加牲口四千头，但如何增加呢？群众购买力如何？银行贷款可以扶助多少？全县母牲畜多少？需要设置多少牲口配种站？则只字未提。这就难免不令人耽忧计划要落空。因此各地不应满足于已订出的计划，应该从新将它审查一遍，仔细讨论出求其实现的有效步骤与方法来，然后加以严格检查、督促，务求其实现。
    （四）具体加强农村支部党员在生产中的活动，纠正不切实际的空调
    数年来的生产运动中，有一条可贵的经验，即只有农村党员在生产运动中，真正成为最出色的劳动者与群众生产的积极领导者时，对激励群众的生产热情，有着决定的意义。党员公开后，这点尤为明显。如共产党员李顺达、向提水、石寸金等，当他们成了劳动英雄的时候，在其领导下的全村群众，亦无不生气勃勃，这种活的榜样，全区党员应该向他们学习。因此使支部成为群众生产的坚强领导核心，使每个党员成为生产战线上最出色的劳动者，就是说服领导群众响应党的政策的最好方法。
    但有些地方，抛开上述情况不顾，一味的在集中群众空洞的讲述什么“努力生产，支援全国战争”，“两种前途”等，结果，不仅耗费了群众极可贵的劳动时间（有些群众已经以不参加这种会作抗议了。我们的官僚主义者，还说群众落后），并且添加了群众许多新的糊涂思想（如怕负担、怕共产等）。这是应该立即纠正的。
