　　"Plant the banner of Mao Zedong all over China!"
　　Xin Tuo
　　Early in the morning, stepping out of the south gate of Liangxiang city, the roads were sprinkled with clear water. Springtime, walking on the moistened yellow earth road, feels exceptionally comfortable. The young People's Liberation Army soldiers all had joyful smiles on their faces. The soldiers were smiling, the people cheering along the roadside were smiling, and the neat footsteps could not conceal the laughter. Wave after wave of sound vibrated across the Hebei Plain.
　　For the past half-month, I have continuously been seeing off the various armies heading south, watching the almost entirely American-equipped iron torrent. New clothes, new shoes and hats, clean white masks, all kinds of firearms, made people happily breathe a sigh of relief. For more than twenty years, nurtured by Chairman Mao's wisdom, this army has become an invincible force. Today, I stood on a higher mound and looked down. In the songs, laughter, and the sounds of gongs and foreign trumpets of thousands of workers, peasants, and students who came to see them off, this long procession of soldiers surged forward, heading south. I could not see the head of the line ahead, and turning around, I could not see the end of the line behind. Above the heads of those seeing them off, fluttered a banner more than ten feet long, reading "Plant the banner of Mao Zedong all over China," which echoed the red flags fluttering in the marching ranks that read "Fight to the South of the Yangtze River, liberate all of China!" Yes, wherever Chairman Mao's troops fight, the people there will be liberated. History has proven this unwavering truth.
　　Along the road, a dozen children with calluses all over their hands were vying to fill the marching water bottles of the People's Liberation Army soldiers, filling one and then another, and after one bottle was finished, going to fetch another. They were not tired at all. ——"We will fully support you!" This is a slogan for the actions of those seeing them off, because the people already understand why they should support the People's Liberation Army. I remember at a public accusation meeting a month ago in Liangxiang, where the pseudo-Ba甲 system was destroyed throughout the city, a sixteen-year-old Chen Yongsheng cried out and said: "This is no longer the era of the pseudo-regime, the Liberation Army is here, I want to speak out. ......" This sentence was repeatedly spoken by those who were making accusations. Today, I saw Chen Yongsheng holding a list of slogans he was going to shout, busy directing people to carry tables and fetch tea. He is now a street representative.
　　The supply vehicles passed by, and a leather-wheeled cart fully loaded with salt and straw overturned into a ditch beside the road because the livestock were frightened by the military horns of those seeing them off. Look! At that moment, those who could unhitch the harnesses, untie the ropes, move the straw, it was indistinguishable whether it was the army doing it or the common people. In just a few minutes, the livestock had been rescued from under the cart, everything had been unloaded, and countless people, pulling and pushing, pulled the cart out of the ditch. In an instant, the salt and straw were loaded back onto the cart, the whip of the People's Liberation Army cracked, and it caught up with the main force.
　　The people seeing them off along the road tried their best to find the People's Liberation Army soldiers who had once lived in their homes. Once found, they held hands, chattering away, reluctant to part, just like family members seeing them off. The people of Fifth Street once presented a red flag to a certain unit, on which was written: "Bring the spirit of loving the people to the South of the Yangtze River."
　　The people instructed the People's Liberation Army: "Fight to the South of the Yangtze River, liberate all of China!" The People's Liberation Army also instructed the people: "Produce more in the rear to support the Liberation War." Everyone's goal is the same: "Plant the banner of Mao Zedong all over China!"

### “把毛泽东的旗帜插遍全中国！”

　　“把毛泽东的旗帜插遍全中国！”
    辛拓
    清晨，走出良乡城的南门，汽车路上泼着匀匀的清水。春天，走在润湿的黄土道上，显得格外的舒适。年轻的人民解放军战士脸上都流露着欢快的笑容。战士们笑着，道旁欢送的人们笑着，整齐的步伐掩没不了的笑声，此起彼伏的在河北平原上振荡。
    半月来，我不断的欢送着南下的各路大军，眼看着几乎全部美械装备的铁流，新衣、新鞋帽、洁白的口罩，各式各样的枪械，使人高兴地长长出了一口气。二十多年来，这支武装在毛主席的智慧哺育下，已经是一支不可战胜的力量了。今天，我特别站在一个较高的土丘上向下了望，在数千欢送的工人、农民、学生的歌声、笑语、铜鼓洋号声中，涌着这列长长的大军，一直向南行进着。前边已经看不见头，扭回头来，后边也看不见尾。欢送者的头上，横飘着一丈多长的“把毛泽东的旗帜插遍全中国”的旗帜，和行进行列里飘荡着的“打到江南去，解放全中国！”的红旗互相辉映。是的，毛主席的队伍打到哪里，哪里的人民就得到解放。历史证明了这个不渝的真理。
    路旁，十几个手背上长满了茧子的小孩，争先的给解放军战士灌着行军水壶，灌满一个再灌一个，一壶完了再去提一壶。他们一点也不疲倦。——“我们全力支援你们！”这是欢送者一个行动的口号，因为人民已经懂得为什么要支援解放军。记得月前良乡全城摧毁伪保甲的诉苦大会上，一个十六岁的陈永生哭诉着说：“这不是伪政权的时代了，解放军来了，我要说一说。………”这句话不只一次被诉苦者反复的说着。今天，我看见陈永生手里拿着准备喊的口号单，忙着指挥抬桌子、弄茶水，他现在已经是街代表了。
    辎重车过来了，一辆满载着盐、草的皮轮大车，因为牲口被欢送者的军号吓惊了，大车翻在路旁的沟里，你看吧！当时卸套的卸套，解绳的解绳，搬草的搬草，分不出是军队干的，还是老百姓干的，仅仅几分钟的功夫，牲口已由车底下解救出来，东西都卸下来了，无数的人，连拉带推，大车由沟里推了出来。顷刻间，盐、草又装上了车，解放军的鞭子一扬，赶上了大队。
    道旁欢送的人们，极力找寻曾经住过自己房子的解放军。找着了，象自己临行的家人一样，拉着手，絮着话，恋恋不舍的。五街人民曾送给某部一面红旗，上面写的：“把爱民的精神带到江南去。”
    人民嘱咐着解放军：“打到江南去，解放全中国！”解放军也嘱咐着人民：“在后方多多生产，支援解放战争。”大家的目的都是一个：“把毛泽东的旗帜插遍全中国！”
