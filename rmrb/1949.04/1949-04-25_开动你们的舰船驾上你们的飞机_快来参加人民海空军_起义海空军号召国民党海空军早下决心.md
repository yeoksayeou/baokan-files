Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 24th: Naval officers of the uprising cruiser "Chongqing" and air force personnel who joined the People's Liberation Army, recently sent a telegram to the Kuomintang Navy and Air Force personnel, calling on them to take decisive action and quickly come to the liberated areas to participate in the construction of the people's new navy and new air force. Excerpts from the telegram are as follows:

　　Navy and Air Force classmates, friends: We, the Navy and Air Force personnel who have joined the People's Liberation Army, recently met. We were extremely happy and excited. Although it was our first meeting, we were as close as brothers, shaking hands and offering condolences to each other, and telling each other about our personal experiences after arriving in the liberated areas and the great people's construction forces we had witnessed. After meeting, we felt even more that our actions were just and glorious, and we were filled with infinite hope and confidence in the construction and development prospects of the people's new navy and new air force. Based on our actual life after arriving in the liberated areas, and the results of our observations in factories, rural areas, etc., we also experienced that only the liberated areas truly achieved "making the best use of people's talents, land resources, and material resources." The people's construction power is great, and the construction and development prospects of the people's new navy and new air force will be unlimited. Now things are clearer than ever. The People's Liberation Army has crossed the Yangtze River and will soon cross the Taiwan Strait to liberate Taiwan. All reactionary forces will inevitably be eliminated, and the time for the liberation of all of China will not be long. We know that many of you are still in pain and hesitation. We sincerely hope that you will take decisive action quickly, based on our past friendship as classmates, colleagues, and friends, start your ships, drive your planes, and come to the liberated areas. All seaports and airports in the liberated areas can allow you to safely dock and land. The Communist Party, the People's Liberation Army, and the people of the liberated areas warmly welcome your just actions. Make up your mind quickly!

    【新华社北平二十四日电】起义的巡洋舰重庆号海军官员和参加人民解放军的空军人员，顷致电国民党海、空军人员，号召他们采取决然行动，迅速到解放区来参加人民的新海军、新空军的建设事业，电文摘录如下：
    海军、空军同学们，朋友们：我们参加人民解放军的海、空军人员，最近会面了，我们高兴和兴奋极了。我们虽然是第一次见面，但是我们都象亲兄弟似的亲热，互相握手慰问，互相诉说我们到了解放区后的亲身经历，和亲眼见到的伟大的人民建设力量。我们见面后，更感到我们的行动是正义的、光荣的，我们对人民的新海军、亲控军的建设事业和发展前途也更充满了无限的希望和信心。根据我们到达解放区后的实际生活，和在工厂、农村等处观察的结果，我们也体验到只有解放区才真正做到了“人尽其才，地尽其利，物尽其用”。人民的建设力量是伟大的，人民的新海军、新空军的建设和发展的前途，将是不可限量的。现在事情已经再明显也没有了。人民解放军已经渡过长江了，不久就要渡过台湾海峡去解放台湾，一切反动势力必然被消灭，全中国解放的时间不再需要很久了。我们知道，现在你们许多人还在痛苦彷徨，我们仅以过去同学、同事、朋友之谊，诚恳地希望你们迅速采取决然的行动，开动你们的舰船，驾上你们的飞机，到解放区来，解放区的一切海港和机场，都可以让你们安全的停泊和降落。共产党、人民解放军和解放区的人民是热烈地欢迎你们的这种正义行动的。你们赶快下决心吧！
