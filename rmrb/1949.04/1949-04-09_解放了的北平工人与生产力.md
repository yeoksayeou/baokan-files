Liberated Workers of Beiping and Productivity
    Our Correspondent Yong Jin

    Before and After Liberation

    Before the liberation of Beiping, workers were always trampled underfoot, living a life of darkness. An old worker from Changxindian who participated in the "February 7th" strike wrote this poem:

    "No wages in August, faces yellow from hunger. No energy to work, only think of the Communist Party."

    After liberation, workers clasped the hands of the soldiers, saying, "Comrades, the Kuomintang made us suffer so much, turning Changxindian into a place of sorrow." Peng Zhen, secretary of the CCP Beiping Municipal Committee, made a special trip to Changxindian to comfort these railway worker brothers who had suffered so much, telling them that the Party had returned from the countryside to the cities to join its own class. The working class had become the masters of the country. Xu Bing, the Deputy Mayor of the Beiping People's Government, hosted banquets for streetcar employees, widely soliciting workers' opinions on building a new Beiping. Comrade Xiao Ming from the Beiping Municipal Federation of Trade Unions also frequently talked with workers. After Li Lisan, chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, came to Beiping, he immediately held a forum with worker representatives at the 70th Arsenal to understand the problems in the workers' movement, pointing out: "To improve the lives of workers, we must first overthrow bureaucratic capitalism."

    A New Life Begins

    A female sewing worker described her current situation this way:

    "The People's Liberation Army is like the god of spring, bringing us joy and light; from now on, we are no longer slaves, a happy day has come."

    Workers' cooperatives have been established in major factories to ensure the supply of workers' necessities and reduce the intermediate exploitation of merchants. In the thirty-two cooperatives, since liberation, 2,245,294 jin of food, as well as large quantities of salt, coal, oil, and other daily necessities, have been sold below market prices.

    To improve themselves, workers make use of their spare time to study diligently. Staff members from Beiping municipality often give lessons to workers or participate in their discussions. Since the establishment of the Beiping Library's mobile reading station, more than 10,000 workers have been reading. Workers at the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant have begun to automatically refute the employer's idea of "work for food," proposing "we want to work for food and also have a say." When a transportation worker saw another worker stealing coal, he immediately stopped him: "This is our own thing, we must cherish our property." Many skilled workers in the Mentougou coal mine are now enthusiastically passing on the "high tricks" they were unwilling to teach before.

    In private factories, in accordance with the principle of benefiting both labor and capital, many have adjusted wages and working hours. In the Zhicheng Cloth Factory and Xinhua Rubber Factory in the Third District, workers used to work eighteen hours a day, and apprentices worked twenty-one hours, and the wages they received were not even enough to support one person; after a negotiated solution, workers and apprentices are now temporarily working twelve hours. In addition to maintaining their personal lives, wages can support one and a half people. After improving their treatment, workers automatically held meetings to review their work attitudes, and work efficiency also improved. Many unemployed workers have also found jobs. A child wrote a poem saying:

    "Peach blossoms are red, willow leaves are green, this year is very different from the past: in the past, Dad was unemployed, this year Dad has returned to work. Dad works and Mom cooks, sending me to school to read. Every day I read it once: "Chairman Mao and the Communist Party lead the people to turn themselves over!"

    The Glory of the Workers of Beiping

    In order to support the front lines and supply the needs of the citizens, the workers are carrying out a production campaign with great enthusiasm. The workers of the Mentougou Coal Mine Company have democratically established production mutual aid groups, producing 120 tons more coal per day than before liberation (with the same number of workers as in the past). In February, the plan was to produce 13,000 tons, but the result was 24,905 tons; in March, the plan was 30,000 tons, but the result was 31,021 tons.

    The Shijingshan Power Plant, which used to be called the "Dark King" by the people of Beiping, never went a month without a power outage in the past; now this title is no longer mentioned. It can now guarantee the light of Beiping. Before liberation, there were fewer than forty streetcars, now seventy-eight can be dispatched, and working hours are automatically increased. A campaign for one hundred streetcars is now underway to welcome "May Day". Railway workers in Changxindian exceeded the quota for cutting rails last month, surpassing 4,336.2 meters in four days. Before liberation, the railway machinery factory produced 3,600 fishplates in six days, now it produces 10,000 in six days, and some workers are injured but still do not rest, forcing the trade union preparatory committee to issue an instruction "no working while injured". In the past, the Yanjing Paper Mill could only produce forty reams of paper per day, now it has increased to more than one hundred reams per day. Before liberation, six to ten out of every one hundred pairs of shoe soles made by the Xinhua Rubber Factory were damaged, after adjusting wages, 471 pairs of shoes were made in three days, and only one and a half pairs were damaged. This production enthusiasm is unprecedented in the history of Beiping.

　　解放了的北平工人与生产力
    本报记者勇进 　 解放前后
    北平未解放前，工人一直被踏在脚下，过着暗无天日的生活。长辛店参加过“二七”大罢工的老工人中产生过这样一首诗：
    “八月里没关饷，饿的面皮黄。工作没有劲，就想共产党。”
    解放后，工人们紧握着战士们的手，“同志，国民党可把我们害苦了，把长辛店变成了伤心店”。中共北平市委书记彭真同志专到长辛店慰勉了这些受尽苦难的铁路工人兄弟，告诉他们党又由农村回到城市与自己的阶级本队结合了。工人阶级已成为国家的主人。北平人民政府徐冰副市长分别宴请电车员工，广泛的听取工人们关于建设新北平的意见。平市总工会萧明同志也时常找工人谈话。全国职工总会主席李立三同志来平后马上就与工人代表在七十兵工厂召开座谈会，了解工运中的问题，指出：“要改善工人的生活，首先必须打垮官僚资本主义。” 　 新的生活开始
    一个女缝工这样描述她现在的情景：
    “解放军象春神，给我们带来了愉快与光明；从此不再作奴隶，幸福的日子已来临。”
    各大工厂里都建立了职工合作社，以保障工人必需品的供给，减少商人的中间剥削。在三十二个合作社中，从解放到现在，低于市价售出食粮二二四五二九四斤，及大批盐、煤、油及其他日用品。
    工人们为提高自己，利用工余紧张学习。平市工作人员时常给工人们上课，或参加他们的讨论。北平图书馆巡回阅览站成立以来，已有万余工人阅览。石景山钢铁厂工人已开始自动反驳“干活吃饭”的雇佣思想，提出“要干活吃饭还要管事”。一个运输工人看到另一工人偷煤时，就马上阻止他：“这是咱们自己的东西，要爱护家产。”门头沟煤矿许多技术工人把自己从前不肯教人的“高着”也热心地传授开了。
    私营工厂中，按劳资两利原则，不少的已调整了工资、工时。三区的志成布厂新华橡胶厂等，过去工人每天做十八个小时的工，学徒做二十一小时，所得工资还不够一个人的生活；经协议解决后，工人学徒，暂时一律改为十二小时。工资除维持个人生活外，能养活一个半人。工人在改善待遇后，自动开会检讨劳动态度，工作效率也提高了。并有不少失业工人得到了职业。一个小孩写了一首诗说：
    “桃花红，柳叶青，今年与往年大不同：往年爸爸失了业，今年爸爸复了工。爸爸做工娘做饭，送我学堂把书念。天天念一遍：“毛主席共产党领导人民把身翻！” 　 北平工人的光荣
    工人为支援前线，供应市民需要，以极大的热情开展生产运动。门头沟煤矿公司工人已民主的建立了生产互助组，每日比解放前多出煤一二○吨（工人与过去相同）。二月份计划出一万三千吨，结果出了二四九○五吨；三月份计划三万吨，结果出三一○二一吨。
    过去被平市人民称为“暗黑大王”的石景山发电厂，以往没有一个月不停电的；现在这个称号已没人再提了。它已能保证北平的光明。电车解放前不足四十辆，现在可出七十八辆，并自动增加工时。现正发起百辆车运动来迎接“五一”。长辛店铁路工人上月竞赛截铁轨，四天超过四三三六·二米。解放前铁路机厂生产夹板六日出三六○○块，现在六日出产一万块，有的工人受了伤还不休息，使工会筹备会不得不发出“不许带伤工作”的指示。过去燕京造纸厂每日只能出纸四十令，现在增至每日百余令。新华橡胶厂在解放前一百双鞋底内总有六双到十双毁的，经过调整工资，三天作鞋四百七十一双，才毁了一双半。这种生产热情，是北平历史上所没有的。
