Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 25th: The key members of the Kuomintang bandit gang who fled from Nanjing to Shanghai continue their dispirited escape to Guangzhou, Taiwan, and other places. After the pseudo-Premier and Minister of Defense, He Yingqin, fled to Shanghai on the 23rd, he immediately summoned war criminals such as Gu Zhutong, Tang Enbo, Zhou Zhirou, Gui Yongqing, and Chen Daqing for a military conference. On the morning of the 24th, He again summoned Pan Gongzhan, Xu Ji, and others, brazenly announcing, "The government has the utmost determination to secure Greater Shanghai." But no sooner had this meeting concluded than He fled to Guangzhou. Also fleeing to Guangzhou were Jia Jingde, Huang ShaoGu, Duanmu Jie, He Zhonghan, and others. It is rumored that bandit chief Chiang Kai-shek fled from Shanghai to Xiamen on a warship on the 24th. Zhang Qun, after seeking instructions from bandit chief Chiang Kai-shek, also hurriedly returned to Chongqing from Shanghai. Gu Zhutong, Weng Wenhao, Sun Lianzhong, Chen Xueping, Yan Xishan, and others fled to Taiwan on the same day. The Songshan Airport in Taipei was filled with the roar of aircraft from morning to night. Planes were constantly evacuating high-ranking bandit gang members from Shanghai. Planes staying in Shanghai dared not stay overnight, all fleeing to Taipei before dark.

    【新华社北平二十五日电】由南京逃到上海的国民党匪帮首要分子继续丧魂落魄地向广州及台湾等地逃命。伪行政院长兼国防部长何应钦于二十三日逃到上海后，当立即召集顾祝同、汤恩伯、周至柔、桂永清、陈大庆等战犯分子举行军事会议。二十四日上午，何又召集潘公展、徐寄＠等大言不惭地宣布：“政府有确保大上海的最大决心。”但这个会刚刚开完，何匪就溜往广州。同时逃到广州的还有贾景德、黄少谷、端木杰、贺衷寒等人。匪首蒋介石据传已于二十四日自上海乘军舰逃向厦门，张群在向匪首蒋介石请示后，亦已由上海慌忙回重庆。顾祝同、翁文灏、孙连仲、陈雪屏、阎锡山等人则于同日逃往台湾。台北松巴机场从早至晚机声隆隆不绝。飞机不断自上海抢撤匪帮高级人员。停留上海的飞机不敢留在上海过夜，均于天黑前逃至台北。
