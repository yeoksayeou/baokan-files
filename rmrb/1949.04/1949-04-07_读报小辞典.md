Reading the Newspaper: A Small Dictionary

    Jeju Island Uprising—In early October 1948, the people of Jeju Island and nearby Seogwipo Island in South Korea organized an armed uprising to oppose the continued presence of aggressive U.S. imperialist troops and the Syngman Rhee puppet regime. At the time, the Syngman Rhee "government" ordered more than 40 cadet students and the 14th Regiment of the Army Garrison stationed in Yeosu, a coastal city in southeastern South Korea, to Jeju Island to carry out suppression. However, the 14th Regiment—approximately 2,400 men—and the cadet students refused this reactionary order and revolted in Yeosu on October 19, joining the People's Revolutionary Armed Forces. From that time on, guerrilla warfare in South Korea spread like wildfire, developing victoriously.
    U.S.-British Joint Chiefs of Staff—The U.S.-British Joint Chiefs of Staff was originally established by the United States and Britain in 1942 during the war against Germany. The anti-fascist war ended more than three years ago, but the U.S. and British imperialists, disregarding the opposition of peace-loving countries and peoples around the world, have consistently maintained this military organization, which is a conspiracy for aggression. In September 1947, the U.S.-British Joint Chiefs of Staff commanded the naval fleets of the United States, Britain, and Canada to conduct provocative exercises in the North Atlantic. In September 1948, they again commanded the air forces of the United States and Britain to conduct so-called "defense" exercises over England. After the signing of the "North Atlantic Treaty," this organization intensified its military aggression. The main representatives participating in the U.S.-British Joint Chiefs of Staff include the Americans Leehey, Denfeld, Bradley, and Vandenberg; the British representatives include Henry, Moore, William, Morgan, and Middlemiss. These representatives are generally warmongers.
