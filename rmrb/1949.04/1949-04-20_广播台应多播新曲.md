　　Radio Stations Should Broadcast More New Songs
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Ge Mao
　　Although superstitious and obscene old operas have now been stopped, there are still many things similar to them. For example, *dagu* performances, *lianhualuo*, *danxian*, storytelling, and popular songs should all be carefully adjusted, because many of them promote obscene ideas, superstitious beliefs, and praise feudalism. Especially popular songs. If you turn on a privately-owned radio station, they are almost all singing about "brother and sister" incessantly, which is very unpleasant to listen to. We suggest that the government prohibit these radio stations from broadcasting these poisonous songs.
　　New songs are welcomed by the people, but the airtime devoted to them is too short (the People's Broadcasting Station only has fifteen minutes a day, and other stations have practically none). It is hoped that radio stations will add more airtime for broadcasting new songs to meet the needs of the masses.

　　广播台应多播新曲

    现在虽然是停演了迷信淫乱的旧剧，但是和那些相似的东西还多的很，例如：大鼓、莲花落、单弦、评书以及流行歌曲等都应当注意的调整一下，因为在那里提倡淫乱思想，神怪迷信，表扬封建等是很多的。尤其是流行歌曲，如你打开无线电里面的私营广播电台，差不多都是郎呀妹呀的唱个不停，十分难听。我们建议政府，禁止这些广播台播放这类有毒素的歌曲。
    新歌曲是人民群众所欢迎的，但时间是太少了（人民广播电台一天只有十五分钟，别的电台简直没有），最好希望电台多加一些播新歌曲的时间，以适应群众的需要。
