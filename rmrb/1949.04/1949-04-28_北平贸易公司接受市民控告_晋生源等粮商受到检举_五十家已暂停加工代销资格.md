　　Beiping Trade Company Accepts Citizen Accusations
  　Jinshengyuan and Other Grain Merchants Reported
    Fifty Businesses Have Had Their Processing and Sales Agent Qualifications Suspended
    [Our Dispatch] The Beiping Trade Company has accepted citizen accusations and investigated the hoarding of currency by grain processing and sales agents, achieving results. The first batch of accusations has revealed the secrets of the trickery by the four worst grain merchants, including Jinshengyuan, Xianbaochang, Dongxingjiu, and Shengli Rice Shop. To supply the people with food, the Trade Company entrusted more than 400 grain merchants in various districts of the city with processing and sales. The contract signed between the Trade Company and the grain processing and sales merchants stipulated that the Trade Company would take into account the reasonable profits of private merchants, and the private merchants would guarantee the quality of the finished products and fulfill the provisions of the agreement between the two parties. For more than a month from the beginning to the present, most of the grain merchants have been honest in their business operations, but a few grain merchants still use base methods such as substituting inferior products for superior ones, adulteration, and speculative selling to deprive the people of their interests and extract illegal profits. The Trade Company, upon receiving feedback from workers and citizens of the city and with the assistance of the street governments in each district, investigated 118 processing and sales shops in the first inner district, fourth inner district, and fifth outer district over the course of a week. Among them, 56, including Wanyuande, performed excellently, with the grain undergoing sun-drying and sifting procedures during processing, and the bran being removed during flour milling to ensure pure quality. Fifty, including Yong'anlong, did not fulfill the original regulations: grain was not sun-dried during storage, the quality of processed flour was poor, and the sales volume reports were not truthful. These businesses have been given the penalty of suspension of processing and sales agent qualifications. In addition, there are twelve grain merchants who have engaged in illegal operations, among which the illegal situations of the four, including Jinshengyuan, are the most serious. A summary of the tricks used by these four bad grain merchants has revealed four categories: The first category is "substituting superior products for inferior ones." The example of Jinshengyuan on Rice Market Street is the most typical: Jinshengyuan received 248,898 catties of wheat from the Grain Branch Company, and calculated at 75 catties of standard flour per 100 catties of wheat, it should have turned in 186,673.5 catties of standard flour; however, the shop actually extracted 700 small bags (30,800 catties) of first and second-grade flour from the flour, and mixed in 1,400 catties of black flour and 4,620 catties of third-grade flour to compensate. The extracted 700 bags of good flour were sold on the market at a high price. Because the standard flour sold by Jinshengyuan was too adulterated, it resembled fourth-grade flour. 669 large bags (60,210 catties) of this low-quality flour were sold to clothing factories and other places. In addition, it screened out large grains from the sorghum rice it sold on commission and sold them privately at high prices, while selling the small grains to citizens at the fixed price. The second category is: stealing or misappropriating raw materials and adulterating them. Dongxingjiu is such a grain merchant. Not only did it produce inferior products, but it also privately wholesaled to peddlers for retail, and stole 7,100 catties of corn, then used the proceeds to buy back soy flour and white corn, milled them into millet flour, and sold them to Huiwen Middle School, and then used the money to report to the Grain Company, in order to seek huge profits. The third category is stealing food grain, which Xianbaochang Grain Store did most fiercely. It successively stole 5,400 catties of food grain, using public grain for speculation and profiteering. The fourth category is failing to take care of food grain, causing it to become moldy and fermented. Shengli Rice Shop had 300 catties of corn that became moldy and 2,000 catties that fermented and tasted bad. The same situation exists in eight other stores, which are currently being investigated. The illegal and harmful acts of the four grain merchants, including Jinshengyuan, have been reported by workers and citizens, and the evidence is conclusive. They will be dealt with separately by the People's Government in accordance with the law.

　　北平贸易公司接受市民控告
  　晋生源等粮商受到检举
    五十家已暂停加工代销资格
    【本报讯】北平贸易公司接受市民检举，清查粮食加工代销店的积币，获得成绩。首批检举已揭发了晋生源、仙保长、东兴久、胜利米庄等四家最坏的粮商捣鬼的秘密。贸易公司为供应民食，曾委托全市各区四百余家粮商加工代销。贸易公司与粮店加工代销粮商所订契约是：贸易公司照顾私商合理利润，私商保障成品的品质，履行双方协议的规定。由开始到目前一个多月中，大多数的粮商都能老实经营，但有少数的粮商依然用提精顶次、搀杂、套卖等卑劣的办法，剥夺人民的利益，榨取非法的利润。贸易公司接受本市工人、市民的反映，于各区街政府协助下，经过一周，清查了内一、内四、外五等三区的加工代销店一百十八家，其中有万源德等五十六家成绩优良，粮食在加工时经过晒筛手续，磨粉时将皮壳打出，保障品质纯良；有永安隆等五十家没有履行原来的规定：保管粮食不经过晒晾、加工磨制面粉品质粗劣，销售数量报告不真实。这些商号已分别予以暂停加工代销的处分。另外有违法经营的粮商十二家，其中有晋生源等四家不法的情形最为严重。综合这四家坏粮商的捣鬼办法已发现的有四类：第一类是“提精顶次”，以米市大街晋生源例子最为典型：晋生源曾向粮食分公司领到小麦二四八、八九八斤，以每百斤小麦缴七五斤通粉计算，应缴通粉一八六、六七三、五斤；而该号竟由面粉中提出头、二等粉七百小袋（三○、八○○斤），另以黑面一、四○○斤，三号面四、六二○斤掺入抵补。提出的七百袋好面，在市场上以高价出售了。晋生源代销的通粉因为掺杂太多，竟和四号粉相似，这种品质低劣的面粉六六九大袋（六○、二一○斤）售给被服厂等处。另外它在代销高粱米中筛出大粒的用高价私自卖出，小粒的按定价卖给市民。第二类是：盗卖或挪用原料及掺杂，东兴久即是这样的粮商。它不但出品粗劣，曾私自批发给小贩零售，并且盗卖玉米七千一百斤，复以卖得价款买回豆黄、白玉米磨成小米面卖给汇文中学，再将卖到的钱顶报粮食公司，以谋厚利。第三类是盗卖食粮，以仙保长粮店搞的最凶。先后盗卖了食粮五千四百斤，利用公粮投机倒把。第四类是不经心保管食粮，致使霉烂发酵。胜利米庄曾霉烂了玉米三百斤，发酵生味者二千斤。同样情形的尚有八家，现正清查中。晋生源等四家粮商此种违法害民行为、经工人和市民检举，证据确凿，即将由人民政府分别依法处理。
