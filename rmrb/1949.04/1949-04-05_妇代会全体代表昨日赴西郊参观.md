　　Women's Congress Representatives Visited the Western Suburbs Yesterday
    [Report from this newspaper] After the conclusion of the First National Women's Congress of China the day before yesterday, all the representatives went to visit the western suburbs yesterday (the 4th). At 11:00 AM, the cars arrived at Yenching University. Yenching University immediately held a welcoming meeting. Female worker representative Zhang Yanqing, female student representative Han Dezhuang, and female faculty representative Yang Junru delivered welcoming speeches respectively. Yenching University students requested to meet the hero and model representatives. The heroes and models immediately went on stage, and comrades from each delegation introduced them one by one. The female students shouted in unison: "We want to learn from you!" After visiting Yenching University, the representatives went to the Summer Palace for sightseeing. When Li Xiuzhen, a representative from North China, heard a comrade tell her that Kunming Lake was man-made, she exclaimed in surprise: "This is all the blood and sweat of the people!" After the tour, the representatives took a group photo. Because such magnificent and beautiful scenic spots already belong to the people, many representatives were excited to perform the Yangko dance when passing through the Long Corridor at the end.

　　妇代会全体代表昨日赴西郊参观
    【本报讯】中国妇女第一次全国代表大会在前天闭幕以后，全体代表于昨（四日）到西郊参观。上午十一时，汽车到达燕京大学，燕大当即举行欢迎会，有女工友代表张艳清、女同学代表韩德庄、女教职员代表杨钧儒等分别致词欢迎，燕大同学要求和代表中的英雄模范见面，各英雄模范当即登台，并由各代表团的同志一一加以介绍，女同学们齐声喊出：“我们要向你们学习！”参观燕大以后，代表们到颐和园游览。当华北代表李秀镇听见一个同志告诉她说，这个昆明湖是人工挖成的，她惊讶地说：“这都是老百姓的血汗呀！”游园完毕，代表们集体照像。由于这样辉煌优美的名胜已经归于人民，最后在经过长廊时，许多代表都兴奋地扭起秧歌舞来。
