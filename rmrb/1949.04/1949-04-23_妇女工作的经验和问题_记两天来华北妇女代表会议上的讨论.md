Experiences and Problems in Women's Work
　　--Notes on Discussions at the North China Women's Representative Conference Over the Past Two Days
　　By Our Reporter Tian Zhen
　　At the North China Women's Representative Conference, twelve representatives spoke enthusiastically, sharing many opinions and experiences, and also raising some unresolved issues.
　　Female workers from Shijiazhuang and Tianjin put forward three points of experience in women workers' work: First, educate them according to the specific suffering and demands of women workers, gradually raising their class consciousness. Only then will women workers consciously accept the truth and fight against all unreasonable phenomena, giving full play to their production enthusiasm. Second, mobilizing women workers to increase their production enthusiasm must be combined with appropriately resolving their immediate interests. Let them tell about the abuse and insults they encountered under the Kuomintang rule, show them great respect and care, and even solving the problem of sanitary napkins will make them feel comforted and moved. Third, women's work should be combined with various tasks. Shijiazhuang's experience shows that women's work is unified in trade union work, which is both convenient and quick to solve problems, and women workers are not isolated. If it starts independently, women workers feel that there is too much time spent in meetings, and the administration and trade union do not agree.
　　Regarding mobilizing rural women, Tong Yi and Dong Hongjing especially emphasized the role of cadres personally taking action in leading production. Some comrades emphasized that appropriately resolving women's interests and rights is necessary to mobilize women's enthusiasm for participating in agricultural production; some representatives also believed that resolving women's issues should be combined with improving farmers' production enthusiasm.
　　Regarding the organizational form of women's work, Representative Han Qimin believed that in the initial stage of mobilizing women, a strong leadership organization from top to bottom like in the past is needed. Today, with a foundation in women's work and further in-depth mobilization, she supports the saying that "the representative meeting is the best organizational form for organizing women." The leading organs only need to leave a few people to direct work, contact all parties, summarize experiences, and hold regular meetings. The remaining members of the Women's Federation can participate in government, health, education, cooperative, and other work, which can strengthen contact with women from all aspects and directly understand and solve women's problems in various aspects. Doing so will truly strengthen women's work, and women's workers must first attach importance to women's work ideologically. Her opinion was supported by everyone. However, whether the newly liberated areas still need an organizational form like the past from top to bottom according to her opinion has not been discussed.
　　Li Zhiguang, the director of the Shijiazhuang nursery, used touching examples to illustrate two important experiences in nursery work. Her nursery had two children whose personalities were very abnormal because their parents were far away. The younger one was called "Dog Boy," and he had been not talking much for more than two years. The older one was called "Ugly Girl," and she was very dull. Once, Ugly Girl saw other children being picked up by their parents, and she quietly asked the nursery worker, "Auntie, where is my mother?" In order to answer this question, their Secretary Zhao recognized her as a goddaughter, and Doctor Du volunteered to be Dog Boy's mother. They treated Dog Boy and Ugly Girl like their own children. Soon, the inactive Ugly Girl became active, and Doctor Du used teaching Dog Boy to speak as a challenge for a competition with another nursery worker, and Doctor Du won. Comrade Li repeatedly told everyone: Pay attention to the issue of maternal love in the future. Please feel free to send your children to the nursery, and hope that mothers will personally do nursery work.
　　The conference also provided opinions on the education and promotion of female cadres and the issues of cadres' families.
　　Finally, some opinions raised by female workers' representatives from Tianjin and Beijing. Some people said that factories and workers should pay attention and inspect these concerns:
　　1. The Tianjin female workers' representative mentioned that after becoming an activist, there are many activities to participate in, and the salary is reduced by one-third in a month.
　　2. The female workers' representative from the Beijing Clothing Factory mentioned that the suspension of work and waiting for materials affects the workers' income, but at the same time, many organs have clothes to be made, but the factory did not contract for them.
　　Of course, this type of issue has not been collected more widely, just a start here.

　　妇女工作的经验和问题
  　记两天来华北妇女代表会议上的讨论
    本报记者  天珍
    华北妇女代表会议大会上，十二个代表争相发言，谈出不少的意见和经验，也提出了一些没有解决了的问题。
    石家庄、天津的女工工作者，提出女工工作三点经验：一、根据女工的具体苦痛与要求进行教育，逐步提高其阶级自觉，女工们才自觉地接受真理，和一切不合理的现象作斗争，高度发挥生产积极性。二、发动女工提高生产热情必须与适当的解决其切身利益相结合，让她们诉出了国民党统治下她们所遭遇到的虐待与侮辱，对她们十分尊重与关怀，即使解决了一点月经纸的事情，她们也会感到安慰和感动。三、妇女工作与各种工作相结合，石家庄的经验说明：女工工作统一在工会工作中，解决问题既方便又迅速，女工也不致孤立起来。如开始单独进行，女工方面感到开会的时间太多，行政与工会也不同意。
    对发动农村妇女，童一和董宏井等特别强调干部在领导生产中亲自下手的作用。有些同志强调必须适当的解决妇女的利益与权利才能发动妇女参加农业生产的积极性；也有些代表认为解决妇女问题，要与农民生产情绪的提高相结合。
    关于妇女工作的组织形式问题，韩启民代表认为当发动妇女的初期，需要象过去自上而下的强有力的领导机构，在今天妇女工作已有基础，深入一步发动的时候，她拥护“代表会是组织妇女最好的组织形式”的说法，领导机关只要留下少数人指挥工作联系各方，总结经验，并定期召开会议等，其余的妇联委员可参加到政权、卫生、教育、合作社等工作中去，可以加强与各方面妇女群众的联系，并直接了解与解决妇女各方面的问题，这样做，才是真正加强了妇女工作，妇女工作者首先在思想上要重视妇女工作。她的意见，获得大家的拥护。但是，按她所说的意见，新解放区还是否仍须有象过去自上而下的那样组织形式，还没有讨论到。
    石家庄保育院长李志光以动人的例子，说明保育工作两个重要经验。她的保育院有两个孩子，因为父母远离，孩子的个性很不正常，小的叫狗小子，两岁多了，一直不大说话，大的叫丑闺女，很沉闷，有一次丑闺女见别的娃娃被父母接走了，她悄悄问保育员：“阿姨，我的妈妈呢？”为了解答这个问题，她们的赵秘书认下她当干闺女，杜大夫自愿当狗小子的妈。她们象自己的儿女一样看待狗小子和丑闺女，不久、不活跃的丑闺女活跃了，并且杜大夫以教会狗小子说话和别一个保育员作为挑战竞赛的条件，结果杜大夫胜利。李同志再三告诉了大家：今后注意母爱的问题了，请大家放心把孩子送到保育院来，并希母亲们要亲自下手做保育工作。
    也大会对女干部教育与提拔问题，干部家属问题提供了意见。
    最后平津女工代表提出的一些意见，有人说应该在报上提起工厂及工人工作者的注意与检查：
    一、天津女工代表提到：当了积极分子之后，参加的活动多，一月之中工资少挣了三分之一。
    二、北平被服厂女工代表提到，停工待料影响到工人的收入，但同时有许多机关人员的衣服要做，而厂方则没去包揽。
    当然这一类的问题还没有更广泛的收集起来，只在这里提个头罢了。
