Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 4th: The wave of strikes and class boycotts against hunger among the people in Kuomintang-ruled areas continues to expand. 1. Teachers in secondary schools in Fuzhou began a general "leave" on March 30th, demanding the issuance of rice and salaries to maintain their livelihoods. The teachers complained that their monthly salaries could not be paid in full on time, making it difficult to maintain even the most basic living standards, and recently they have been unable to borrow money. Students in various middle schools in the city have also launched enthusiastic support movements for the teachers' anti-hunger struggle. 2. More than one hundred lecturers and teaching assistants at Sichuan University in Chengdu went on strike on the 2nd because the Kuomintang reactionary government announced that the cost of living index for adjusting treatment in the Chengdu area was too low. Last month, all the professors at the school held a week-long strike to protest the excessively low treatment. 3. Students at Guiyang Medical College and Guiyang Normal College, following the anti-hunger parade by students at Guizhou University on the 26th, also held anti-hunger parades one after another and petitioned the pseudo-provincial government. 4. All professors, lecturers, and teaching assistants at Guangxi University in Guilin have been on strike for a week and are still persisting. The strike that recently occurred on the Xiang-Gui Railway is also continuing.

　　国民党统治区人民无法生活
  　反饥饿斗争益扩大
    成都等地教员工人罢教罢工
    【新华社北平四日电】国民党统治区人民反饥饿的罢教、罢工的浪潮，继续扩展。一、福州中等学校教员三月三十日开始总“请假”，要求发给食米、薪水维持生活。教员们诉说：每个月的薪水都不能够按期一次发清，最低生活也难维持，最近已经是借贷无门了。该市各中学的学生对教师们的反饥饿斗争也热烈展开声援运动。二、成都四川大学讲师、助教一百多人，因为国民党反动政府所公布的成都区调整待遇生活指数过低，二日起罢教。上月间该校全体教授即曾为抗议待遇过低举行罢教一周。三、贵阳医学院及贵阳师范学院学生，继二十六日贵州大学学生反饥饿游行之后，也接连举行了反饥饿游行，并向伪省府请愿。四、桂林广西大学全体教授、讲师、助教已罢教一星期，现仍在坚持中。湘桂路最近发生的罢工，也还在继续进行。
