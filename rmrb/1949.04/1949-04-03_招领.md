　　A rickshaw puller named Zhao Jiantang told a comrade in the Eighth District Working Group: on the 28th, a person riding a bicycle hired his rickshaw to carry a bag of flour and a lined robe from Hepingmen to Xidan. However, after traveling for some distance, he lost sight of the cyclist. These two items are currently being kept by him. We hope the owner will come to claim them at the Xin Ju Iron Factory, No. 94 Damochang Street, Qianmenwai.

    三轮车夫赵鉴镗托第八区工作组的一个同志告诉我们：廿八日有一个骑自行车的人，叫他的车子装了一袋面粉和一件夹袍，从和平门到西单。不料，走了一段路之后，他就看不见那骑自行车的人了。现在这两件东西都在他那里保存着，希望失主即到前外打磨厂九十四号新聚铁厂去认领。
