　　Employee Life
　　Establishing Cooperatives, Providing Grain at Low Prices, Studying for Progress, Increasing Production
    ▲ The China People's Printing Factory, with over three thousand employees, has established an employee cooperative. The cooperative purchased more than 200,000 jin of food grains, including flour, millet, sorghum rice, and cornmeal, from the general cooperative and sold them to the workers at low prices. Workers flocked to buy them and expressed great satisfaction. (Gao Deming)
    ▲ More than 400 railway employees at Fengtai Station donated goods and money generously during the campaign to support the army. They have now donated 48,000 yuan and sent letters of appreciation. (Jiu)
    ▲ The machine dyeing factory of the North China Military Supply Clothing Bureau No. 1 launched a production competition. Workers Cui Goushuan, Ge Shijun, Zhang Pu, and Liu Quansheng volunteered to work night shifts, some starting as early as 2 a.m. Yang Zhongjie, Yu Jingyan, Zhang Decheng, and Han Shouye sometimes got up to work as early as 12 a.m. Workers Liu Fulin and Zhao Wuxiang also worked on Sundays to repair troughs and dryers. Since the start of the competition, both the quantity and quality of finished products have improved significantly.
    ▲ The preparatory committee for the North Sea Park Employees' Union has been formally established, with seven people elected as members. They are now conducting employee learning activities. More and more employees are buying chalk, finding blackboards, and subscribing to newspapers.
    ▲ Employees of the Jibei Electric Power Company are preparing to establish an employee union in mid-April. They have been actively recruiting members since March 21st, and participation has been very enthusiastic, with applications exceeding 90% of the total number of employees.
    ▲ In order to strengthen the learning of its staff, the Ping City Clothing General Factory has divided its 148 employees into 13 groups according to administrative units for study. The main content is "Carry the revolution through to the end." The method is to raise questions for discussion and then summarize and improve. Some people thought that the reactionaries were finished and that the US economic crisis was serious, so there was no need to fight anymore, but they were refuted by everyone.
    ▲ The Qinghe Woolen Mill held a grand military-civilian get-together on the afternoon of the 2nd. All employees of the factory and soldiers of the 41st Army stationed there participated, and operas such as "Brother and Sister Reclaiming Wasteland" and "Beasts Seeking Peace" were performed.
    ▲ After study and short-term training, the employees of the Fourth Institute of the 70th Ordnance Factory realized that working today is for themselves, and their enthusiasm for production has increased. Now, the production efficiency in nine hours has increased compared to the Kuomintang era. For example, Dou Guanying and three others increased by 3.6%, and Xu Changfu and three others increased by 3.5%. Everyone is still working hard. The blackboard newspaper will issue a call to learn from the workers of the Fourth Institute. (Guo Maolin)
    ▲ Workers at the Guanting Reservoir are enthusiastically engaged in learning, with widespread discussions on the differences between pre-liberation and post-liberation. Many workers were extremely angry when recalling the bullying they suffered from the Kuomintang police and secret agents in the past. The conclusion was that to consolidate the liberation we have now obtained, we must support the front lines and completely defeat the US-Chiang reactionaries.

    职工生活
　　成立合作社　低价供粮食　学习求进步　生产更有劲
    ▲三千多职工的中国人民印刷厂成立了职工合作社，由合作总社购入食粮面粉、小米、高粮米、玉米面二十余万斤，廉价卖给工人，工人前往购买者十分拥挤，并极表满意。  （高德明）
    ▲丰台车站四百多铁路职工在劳军运动中，献物、捐款的很多。现已捐到四万八千元，并有慰问信。  （久）
    ▲华北军供被服一局机染厂开展生产竞赛运动，工人崔狗拴、葛士军、张普、刘全生等均自动打夜工，有的从夜两点就开始工作。杨忠杰、于景言、张德成、韩守业等四人，有时夜十二时就起床上工，工人刘福林、赵武祥二人在礼拜天也不休息，自动修理槽子和干燥机。竞赛以来，成品、质量也有显著提高。
    ▲北海公园职工筹委会已正式成立，选出七人为筹委，现在开展职工学习。职工买粉笔、找黑板、订报纸的日见增多。
    ▲冀北电力公司职工，预备在四月中旬成立职工会。自三月二十一日起积极办理吸收会员工作，报名参加者甚为跃踊，现已超过职工总数百分之九十。
    ▲平市被服总厂为加强职员学习，将全厂职员一百四十八人按行政单位划分为十三个小组，进行学习。内容以“将革命进行到底”为主。方法是大家提问题讨论，最后总结提高。有人以为反动派已经完蛋，美国经济危机严重，用不着打了等，都被大家驳斥了。
    ▲清河制呢厂，二日下午召开盛大的军工联欢大会。全厂职工及驻厂四十一军战士均参加。并演出“兄妹开荒”、“野兽求和”等歌剧。
    ▲七十兵工厂第四所职工经过学习与短训，觉悟到今天干活是为自己，生产情绪高涨。现在九小时的生产效率已较国民党时期提高。如窦冠英等四人增加百分之三点六，徐长富等三人增加百分之三点五。大家还在继续努力。黑板报上将发出号召向四所的工友们看齐。  （郭茂林）
    ▲官厅水库工人热烈展开学习，普遍的讨论，题是解放前与解放后的不同。许多工人在回忆到过去受国民党警宪的欺侮时，极为愤怒。结论都说：要想巩固现在所获得的解放，必须支援前线，彻底打垮美蒋反动派。
