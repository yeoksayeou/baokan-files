　　Delusional About Using War to Resolve Crisis
  　U.S. Imperialism's Huge Military Budget
    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 17th—U.S. monopoly capitalists, delusional about using aggressive war to resolve the economic crisis, have had their hired congressional representatives pass a military expenditure budget bill of unprecedented size for the U.S. during peacetime. According to a report by the Associated Press, 271 representatives representing U.S. monopoly capitalists passed a military expenditure of $15,909,116,800 for the 1950 fiscal year (July 1st to June 30th of next year) in the House of Representatives on the 13th. This bill, which violates the will of the American people and increases the burden on taxpayers, has been submitted to the Senate for discussion. It can be predicted that, at a time when 600 million organized people around the world have expressed their determination to defend peace, this war plan will ultimately be crushed by the increasingly powerful forces of peace around the world.

　　妄想用战争解脱危机
  　美帝军费预算庞大
    【新华社北平十七日电】妄想用侵略战争来解脱经济危机的美国独占资本家，经过其雇佣的国会议员通过了美国和平时期空前庞大的军费预算法案。据合众社报道，代表美国独占资本家的二百七十一个众议员，于十三日在众议院通过了一九五零年财政年度（七月一日至明年六月三十日）的军费一百五十九亿零九百十一万六千八百美元。这个违反美国人民意志、增加纳税人负担的法案，已经提交参议院讨论。可以预言，在全世界六万万有组织的人民已经表示了保卫和平的决心之际，这一战争计划，终将被日益发展壮大的全世界和平力量所粉碎。
