Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, 24th: The All-China Federation of Trade Unions has issued instructions on commemorating May Day. The full text is as follows:

　　This year's "May Day" Labor Day is approaching. The working class of the world will commemorate this festival of striving for liberation with high spirits and a fighting posture, under the slogan of supporting world peace and opposing imperialism's instigation of a new war. Under the wise leadership of its own political party, the Chinese Communist Party, and its own leader, Chairman Mao Zedong, our Chinese working class, united with the broad masses of the people, has achieved glorious victory after a long period of arduous struggle. The Kuomintang reactionaries, in order to maintain their remaining reactionary forces, to buy time to regroup their forces and stage a comeback, and to extinguish the revolutionary forces, engaged in hypocritical peace conspiracies. After more than half a month of negotiations, the reactionary Nanjing Kuomintang government, under the control of US imperialism and Chiang Kai-shek, resolutely rejected the domestic peace agreement proposed by the Chinese Communist Party. As long as they reject this agreement, their plot will be completely bankrupt. During the negotiations, the Kuomintang reactionaries intensified various war preparations and massacred a large number of students in Nanjing who demanded peace. This tells us once again that the Kuomintang reactionaries have no sincerity in resolving domestic problems through peaceful means and are determined to fight the counter-revolutionary war they launched to the end. Only by completely eliminating the Kuomintang reactionary forces and sweeping away the counter-revolutionary nests in various places can the Chinese people obtain true democratic peace. Therefore, Chairman Mao Zedong and Commander-in-Chief Zhu De ordered all commanders and fighters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army on April 21 to resolutely advance to the south of the Yangtze River and other areas still ruled by the reactionaries, thoroughly, completely, and cleanly eliminate all Kuomintang troops who dare to resist, liberate the people of the whole country, and realize the Eight Peace Proposals. On the third day after the start of the Yangtze River Crossing Campaign, the People's Liberation Army occupied Nanjing, the revolutionary center of the Kuomintang for twenty-two years, and the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang was declared extinct. Our working class and all oppressed people should commemorate this year's "May Day" by celebrating their own victories and striving for greater victories. To this end, the following tasks should be carried out:

　　(1) The revolution must be carried through to the end. The hypocrisy of the Kuomintang reactionaries' peace conspiracy has been exposed. Our working class must unite with the people of all patriotic and democratic classes in the country, respond to the call of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and carry the revolution through to the end. Strive for the complete victory of the National People's Liberation War. Therefore, the workers in the liberated areas should unite with all the people, warmly welcome the PLA to the south with the greatest enthusiasm, and increase industrial and agricultural production with a high degree of labor enthusiasm, providing the front lines with all necessary military and material resources, so that they can more quickly destroy all enemies. Workers in the Kuomintang-controlled areas should unite all working people and patriotic bourgeoisie, and use all possible means to protect all production facilities, equipment, and raw materials, prevent the destruction and removal by the evil enemies, and prepare to welcome the People's Liberation Army to liberate the vast cities and villages in the South.

　　(2) Must rapidly restore and develop production, strive for China's complete independence, and strive for the gradual improvement of the material life of the working class and the people of the whole country. The underdevelopment of China's industrial production is the result of the long-term rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism in China, and it is also the fundamental reason why our Chinese nation has suffered from imperialist aggression and bullying, and suffered from poverty and suffering. What is the purpose of our working class and the people of the whole country risking bloodshed and sacrifice to overthrow imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism? It is to develop production, prosper the economy, and make China not only politically but also economically a truly independent and autonomous country, so that the Chinese people can not only completely get rid of the suffering of the three layers of oppression by imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucracy, but also gradually improve our lives with the development of production. Therefore, the workers in the liberated areas must understand that after liberation, they have not only gotten rid of the suffering of oppression and contempt, and the inhuman life of being insulted and beaten, but have also become the leading class of the new democratic regime and the masters of society and the country. Therefore, we should take a master's attitude towards labor, actively produce, endure hardships, and do more work, become a model for all the people, so that production can be quickly restored and developed, and the lives of our workers and all the people can be gradually improved. But to achieve this goal, we must resolutely implement the policy of "both public and private interests are taken care of, and both labor and capital benefit" as instructed by Chairman Mao. Therefore, all trade union organizations and management organs of public enterprises must care about the needs of the workers, quickly resolve the reasonable and possible demands raised by the workers, and strive to improve the lives of the workers. Only in this way can we achieve the goal of raising the workers' enthusiasm for production. In private enterprises, trade unions should negotiate with capitalists on behalf of workers and shop assistants, sign contracts with trade associations organized by capitalists, properly resolve labor-capital disputes, and eliminate the old semi-feudal oppression and excessive exploitation. If this is not done, it will damage the enthusiasm of the workers, and it will not be possible to achieve the goal of developing production and prospering the economy, which is a mistake. But at the same time, it is necessary to explain to the workers that excessive wage demands and excessive treatment demands, especially incorrect forms of struggle, are harmful to the development of production and the prosperity of the economy. Since it is harmful to the development of production and the prosperity of the economy, it is harmful to the current and future interests of the working class. Therefore, whether it is for public or private enterprises, a reasonable attitude should be adopted to resolve public-private relations and labor-capital relations, and there should be no excessive demands, otherwise it is a mistake. In private enterprises, workers should jointly assume the responsibility of developing production and prospering the economy with the capitalists in order to achieve the goal of benefiting both labor and capital. It is absolutely impossible to only consider the interests of the workers without considering the business interests of the capitalists. At the same time, capitalists should be made to adopt an attitude that takes care of the interests of the workers. Trade unions should publicize this to the capitalists so that they understand that they should never only consider the interests of the capitalists without considering the interests of the workers, otherwise it is a mistake on the part of the capitalists.

　　(3) Must establish a solid trade union organization. The strength of the working class lies in organization. There is no strength without organization. The trade union is the most important mass organization of the working class. We must organize all manual and mental laborers who rely solely or mainly on wages and salaries as a source of livelihood into trade unions. Therefore, we must establish trade unions from top to bottom in a planned and orderly manner according to the industrial and occupational systems, so that workers in various industries and trades are included in several large trade unions, in order to avoid the phenomenon of being scattered and disorganized, to facilitate centralized and unified leadership, and to promote the great organizational power of the working class. To this end, we must oppose the closed-doorism, sectarianism, and guildism that restrict trade unions under the pretext of political beliefs, levels of awareness, and partial guild interests. This closed-doorism, sectarianism, and guildism are the main obstacles in the current work of establishing and expanding trade unions. To this end, we must earnestly realize the democratic life of trade unions, widely use the system of trade union representative conferences, so that all the work of trade unions can truly achieve the goal of being decided by the masses themselves and implemented by the masses themselves. The leadership role of our trade union leading organs lies in persuading the trade union masses to willingly accept our proposals, and we must never adopt coercive orders and paternalistic methods to achieve our goals. The responsible personnel of the trade union must implement a strict election system, and should not implement an appointment system, because the implementation of the appointment system will make the workers unhappy, and the result will be that the trade union leading organs will be divorced from the trade union masses and fall into isolation. Only when the trade union implements a democratic election system can it become an organization that is truly loved by the broad masses of workers. Only in this way can the trade union become a reliable pillar of the new democratic regime.

　　(4) Unite all democratic forces in the world, oppose the threat of imperialist war of aggression, and safeguard world peace. Our Chinese working class and all the people, especially in recent years, have deeply recognized the aggressive ambitions of US imperialism. Because US imperialism has tried its best to support the Kuomintang forces headed by Chiang Kai-shek, attempting to eliminate the Chinese democratic revolutionary forces and turn China into an American colony, this aggressive conspiracy of US imperialism has been gradually bankrupt under the valiant resistance of the Chinese workers and the people of the whole country. Due to the existence and increasing development of huge economic and political crises within the United States, as well as the internal existence of imperialist countries such as Britain, France, the Netherlands and Belgium, their regimes are very unstable, their future is extremely bleak, and their days of death are approaching. Therefore, they are carrying out large-scale aggression conspiracies all over the world, creating the Marshall Plan, supporting the reactionary forces of various countries, organizing aggressive fronts, successively concluding the Inter-American Treaty of Reciprocal Assistance and the North Atlantic Treaty, and are brewing the conclusion of the Pacific Pact, actively preparing for war of aggression, opposing all democratic countries headed by the Soviet Union, and suppressing the laboring people of all capitalist countries. We deeply know that China's independence, freedom, and peace must stand with the world's peaceful and democratic forces to oppose the aggressive forces headed by US imperialism. Therefore, we fully support the statement of the democratic parties headed by the Chinese Communist Party against the North Atlantic Treaty: "If the imperialist aggressive group dares to provoke this reactionary war that endangers the people of the world, then we will unite the people of the whole country and abide by the principles of Mr. Sun Yat-sen to launch a resolute struggle, defeat the aggressors, overthrow the entire imperialist system, and realize the liberation of all mankind and permanent peace." US imperialism seems to be powerful, but it is actually a paper tiger that looks strong but is weak inside. Other imperialist countries are even second- or third-rate paper tigers. Only if the world's democratic forces unite and work hard can their aggressive conspiracies be shattered and the world's peaceful situation be maintained. If people dare to launch a war of aggression madly and rashly, then all the world's democratic forces will unite to give them a head-on blow and beat them to a pulp, and the whole world will become a new world ruled by the people.

　　Regarding the way to commemorate "May Day," in the current situation where the national victory is about to come, May Day Labor Day should not only become a day of commemoration for the vast masses of workers, but also become a mass celebration for all the people. Therefore, we have the following suggestions.

　　(A) In major cities in the liberated areas, the trade union should initiate and invite all mass organizations to participate together to organize a May Day Preparatory Committee in order to mobilize all the people to enthusiastically participate in this commemoration.

　　(B) In the days before May Day, meetings such as forums, speeches, and activist meetings should be organized among the broad masses, especially among the workers, to publicize the significance of May Day Labor Day and the tasks of the Chinese working class and all the people at present.

　　(C) Consult with all newspapers and periodicals to intensify the publicity of May Day commemoration in the days before May Day. Publish a special May Day commemorative issue on May Day.

　　(D) On May Day, hold grand mass commemorative rallies and demonstrations in general and in various districts.

　　(E) On May Day or the two days before and after, organize various evening parties separately so that the broad masses of workers can participate. The main thing is to mobilize the workers themselves to create various entertainment programs, and at the same time, there must be reports and speeches on May Day.

　　(F) In the Kuomintang-controlled areas, various democratic trade unions should carry out publicity and commemoration of May Day in various forms according to the objective conditions, but it is necessary to organize mass gatherings and demonstrations.

　　After the May Day commemoration, trade unions in various places should make a summary of this work experience and lessons learned and report to us.

　　中华全国总工会关于纪念五一劳动节的指示
    【新华社北平二十四电】中华全国总工会顷发表关于纪念五一劳动节的指示，全文如下：
    今年的“五一”劳动节快到了。全世界的工人阶级都将以激昂的心情和战斗的姿态，在拥护世界和平，反对帝国主义挑拨新战争的口号下，来纪念工人阶级这个争取解放的节日，我们中国工人阶级在自已的政党——中国共产党和自已的领袖——毛泽东主席的英明领导下，联合全国大人民群众经过长期的艰苦奋斗，已经获得光辉的胜利。国民党反动集团。为了保持其残余的反动势力，争取喘息时间，重整兵力，卷土重来，扑灭革命势力。他们就进行了虚伪的和平阴谋。经过半个多月的谈判，南京国民党反动政府，在美帝国主义和蒋介石控制之下，断然拒绝了中国共产党提出的国内和平协定。只要他们拒绝这个协定，他们的阶谋就全部破产了。而在谈判进行期间，国民党反动集团更加紧进行种种有关战争的准备，并且屠杀了南京要求和平大批学生，这样就再一次告诉我们，国民党反动集团毫无以和平方示解决国内问题的诚意，决心将他们所发动的反革命战争打到底。只有彻底消灭国民党反动势力，扫清各地的反革命巢穴，中国人民才能得到真正的民主的和平。因此毛泽东主席和朱德总司令已于四月二十一日，命令中国人民解放军全体指挥员、战斗员，向长江以南及其他尚被反动派统治的地方坚决地前进，彻底、全部、干净地消灭一切敢于抵抗的国民党军队，解放全国人民，实现八项和平主张。在实行渡江作战以后的第三天，人民解放军便占领国民党二十二年来的革命中心南京，国民党反动统治从此宣告灭亡。我们工人阶级及一切被压迫的人民，在今年应以庆祝自已已得到的胜利和努力争取更大的胜利来纪念“五一”劳动节。为此，应进行下列各项工作：
    （一）必须将革命进行到底。国民党反动集团的和平性阴谋的虚伪已经暴露。我们工人阶级必须团结全国一切爱国民主阶级的人民，响应毛主席朱总司令的号召，把革命进行到底。争取全国人民解放战争的彻底胜利。因此，在解放区的工人应当联合全体人民，以最大的热忱欢送解放军南下，以高度的劳动热情的提高工业农业生产，供给前线以一切必需军用和物资，使能更迅速地摧毁一切敌人。在国民党统治区和工人，应当团结一切劳动人民，与爱国的资产阶级用一切可能的方法，保护一切生产机关的器材原料，防止万恶敌人的破坏与 移，并准备迎接人民解放军去解放 南方广大的城市和乡村，
    （二）必须迅速恢复和发展生产，争取中国的完全独立，争取工人阶级及全国人民的物资生活逐渐改善。中国工业生产不发展，是帝国主义、封建主义、与官僚资本主义长期统治中国的结果，同时也就是我们中华民族遭受帝国主义侵略欺侮、遭受贫穷痛苦的基本原因。我们工人阶级和全国人民不惜流血牺牲去推翻帝国主义、封建主义与官僚资本主义，是为了什么目的呢？就是为发展生产，繁荣经济，使中国不仅在政治上而且在经济上面为真正独立自主的国家，使中国人民不仅能彻底摆脱帝国主义、封建主义与官僚主义三层压榨的痛苦，而且能随着生产的发展，就可以逐渐改善我们的生活。因此，解放区的工人，要了解解放后，不仅摆脱了遭受压迫贱视的痛苦，遭受侮辱打骂的非人生活，而且成了新民主主义政权的领导阶级，成了社会国家的主人。所以，我们应以主人翁的劳动态度，积极生产，吃得苦，做得多，成为全体人民的模范，使生产能迅速地恢复和发展起来，使我们工人和全体人民的生活都能逐渐地改好起来。但是达到这个目的，必须坚决执行毛主席所指示的“公私兼顾，劳资两利”的政策。所以一切工会组织与公营企业的管理机关，必须关心工人的需要，迅速解决工人所提出的合理而可能的要求，力求使工人的生活有所改善。只有这样，才能达到提高工人生产积极性的目的，在私营企业中，职工会应当代表工人店员与资本家协商，与资本家织组的同业公会订立契约，适当地解决劳资争议，解除旧有的半封建压迫和过分的剥削。如果不是这样做，就将损害工人的积极性，就不能达到发展生产，繁荣经济的目的，就是犯错误。但在同时，又必须向工人好好地说明，过高的工资要求和过高的待遇要求，特别是不正确的斗争方式。是于发展生产繁荣经济有害的，既然对于发展和产繁荣经济有害的，就是对于工人阶级的现在利益和将来利益都有害的，因此，不论对公营企业和私营企业，都应采取合理地解决公私关系和劳资关系的态度，而不应有过分的要求，否则就是错误，在私营企业中，工人应与资方共同担负发展生产繁荣经济的责任，才能达到劳资两利目的，绝不可以只顾工人的利益而不顾资本家的企业利益。同时，应使资本家采取照顾工人利益的态度，工会应向资本家作宣传，使他们了解这一点绝不可以只顾资本家一方面的利益，而不顾工人方面的利益，否则就是资本家的错误。
    （三）必须建立巩固职工会组织，工人阶级的力量就是在于组织，不组织便没有力量。工会是工人阶级最主要的群众组织。我们必须把一切以工资和薪水为生活资料的唯一来源或主要来源的体力和脑力的顾备劳动者，都组织在工会之内。因此，我们必须有计划地有条理从上而下，地按照产业和职业系统去建立职工会，使各种产业和行业的工人都包括在几个大的职工会之内，才能免除零乱散漫的现象，才便于集中统一的领导，才能发扬工人阶级伟大的组织的力量，为此，就必须反对以政治信仰、觉悟程度、局部行会利益等等借口限制职工人会的关门主义的宗派主义的和行会主义的思想，这种关门主义的宗派主义的和行会主义的思想，是目前建立的和扩大职工会工作中的主要的障碍，为此就必须切实实现工会的民主生活的广泛地运用职工代表会议的制度，使工会的一切工作，真正达到由群众自已决定，群众自已执行的目的，我们工会领导机关的领导作用，是在于说服职工群众，使职工群众乐意接受我们的主张，决不可以采用强迫命令和包办代替的方法去达到我们的目的，工会的负责人员，必须实行严格的选举制度，而不应该实行委派制度，因为实行的委派制度，工人群众不高兴，其结果就使工会领导机关脱离职工群从，而陷于孤立，只有工会实行了民主的选举制才能使工会成为真正广大职工群从所爱护的组织。也只有这样，才能使工会成为新民民主义政权的可靠柱石。
    （四）联合世界上一切民主势力，反对帝国主义侵略战争的威协，保卫世界和平。我们中国工人阶级和全体人民，特别在最近几年来，深切地认识了美帝国主义的侵略野心。因为美帝国主义极力扶植以将介石为首的国民党势力，企图消灭中国民主革命力量，企图把中国变为美国殖民地，美帝国主义的这种侵略阴谋，在中国工人和全国人民的奋勇抗击之下，已经一步步的陷于破产了，由于美国帝国主义用英法荷比等国帝国主义国家的内部存在着，并且日益发展美钜大的经济危机和政治危机，他们的江山很不稳固，他们前途极为黑暗，他们的死亡日子日益迫近，于是乎他们就在全世界上大规模地进行侵略的阴谋，造出马歇尔计划，扶持各国的反动势力。组织侵略阵线，先后订立南北美洲的公约，北大西洋公约，并且酝酿着订立太平洋公约，积极准备侵略战争，反对以苏联为首的一切民主国家，并镇压各资本主义国家的劳动的人民。我们深知道，中国的独立自由与和平，必须与世界和平民主势力站在一块，反对以美帝国主义为首的侵略势力，所以，我们完全的拥护以中国共产党为首的各民主党，反对北大西洋公约的声明：“如果帝国主义侵略集团竟敢挑动这个危害全世界人民的反动的战争，那么，我们将团结全国人民，遵守孙中山先生的发动者作坚决斗争。打败侵略者，推翻整个帝国主义制度，实现全人类的解放和永久的和平，”美帝国主义看来好似有力量，其实是一个外强中干的纸老虎，其他帝国主义国家更是二三等纸老虎，只有全世界民主势力团结一致，努力奋斗，他们的侵略阴谋是可以粉碎的，世界的和平局面是可以维持的，如果人们竟敢疯头疯脑冒冒失失地发动侵略战争，那么，全世界一切民主势力就将联合起来给他们一个迎头痛击，把他们打得落花流水，全世界变成人民统治的新世界。
    关于纪念“五一” 方式，在目前全国胜利快要到来的形势下，五一劳了不仅不仅应当成为广大工人群从的纪念日，而且还成为全体人民群众性的纪念 。因此，我们有下列各项建议。
    （甲）在解放区各大城市中，应由工会发起，邀请所有一切民众团体共同参加，组织五一节筹备委员会，以便动员全体人民群众热烈参加这一纪念。
    （乙）在五一以前的几天时间内，就应在广大群众中，首先在职工群众中，组织座谈会，演讲会、积极分子会议等，  宣传五一劳动节的意义和中国工人阶级与全体人民在目前的任务。
    （丙）商请一切报纸刊物，在五一节以前的几天内，加紧五一纪念的宣传。在五一这一天出版五一纪念特刊。
    （丁）在五一节，举行总的分区的盛大的群众纪念大会游行示威。
    （戊）在五一或前后两日中，分别组织各种晚会，使广大职工群众都能参加，主要是要动员工人群众自已各种游艺节目，同时必须关于五一的报告和演讲。
    （己）在国民党统治区，各民主工会应当按照客观条件的可以形式种各样的方式，进行宣传和纪念五一，但为一定要组织群众的集会和示威游行。
    各地职工会，在五一纪念后，应将这项工作经验教训，作成一个总结，报告我们。
  中华全国总工会一九四九年四月二十四日
