　　The Straw Hat Industry in Shangjialin
　　Is an Outlet for Handicraft Textile Workers to Change Professions; Hoping for Better Support from the Local Government.
　　The straw hat industry in Shangjialin, Xian County, has a history of eighty years. Initially, it only involved weaving straw hat braids and selling them to major cities across the country. Later, some were made into suitcases and handbags, and transported to foreign countries through Qingdao, Tianjin, Shanghai, and other places. Since Shangjialin learned to manufacture finished products in the ninth year of the Republic of China (1920), the straw hat industry in Shangjialin began to develop in a new way. Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, it had developed to 85 straw hat factories, with 210 machines and more than 600 workers, capable of weaving 840 dozens of straw hats per day. Every spring and summer, merchants from all over came to purchase goods in an endless stream. As a result, knitting straw hat braids became one of the main side occupations for many farmers in Xian County, Jiaohe, Jianguo, Hejian, Raoyang, Qingxian, and other places. At that time, no less than 50,000 women alone participated in this production. Unmarried girls in various villages used the money they earned from knitting straw hat braids to pay for their dowry.
　　After the War of Resistance Against Japan, due to the destruction by the enemy and puppet regimes, most of the machines were destroyed, and the straw hat industry in Shangjialin completely collapsed.
　　After the liberation of Xian County, in the spring of the thirty-sixth year of the Republic of China (1947), with the active organization of the Industry and Commerce Bureau, and the investment and support of the Jizhong River Bureau and the Jixi Jianhe Store, the straw hat industry in Shangjialin began to recover. However, due to the lack of capital and the difficulty in repairing the machines for a while, the straw hat industry was still subject to seasonal restrictions, and it could only be woven and sold in the favorable season of selling finished products every year, and could not be produced regularly. Last winter, the Xian County Promotion Agency established a branch in Shangjialin to specialize in leading this side occupation. Through the leadership of the village cooperative, it organized a straw hat factory with the nature of mass cooperation, mobilized the masses to invest, and the profits were divided between shareholders and workers at a ratio of 60/40 (40 for workers, 60 for shareholders). It also consulted with machine owners that each machine was counted as 50 yuan of equity. For the workers who didn't want dividends, they earned three catties of rice per day in addition to food and drink. In order to solve the funding difficulties, the publicly-owned Jizhong Yudong Store uniformly purchased the finished products, and stipulated that payment should be made before taking delivery of the goods. In the first month, it paid 1.16 million yuan and ordered 2,400 dozens of hats. With such support, the straw hat industry gradually developed. 797 households have invested successively, with a total investment of 176,210 yuan. The whole village has formed four factories, with 74 workers, 56 machines operating regularly, and producing 196 dozens of straw hats per day, which can yield a profit of 9,800 yuan. The 14 machines in the three villages around Shangjialin, such as Weizhuang, have also been driven up, and many villages such as Huangqinzhuang are also repairing machines in preparation for starting work.
　　Now, no less than 20,000 farmers in the villages within a radius of dozens of miles around are participating in knitting straw hat braids. Everyone says, "With the straw hat factory in Shangjialin starting work, we have work to do."
　　Because the straw hat industry is the main side occupation of the people in the Xian County area, and machines cannot replace it, the straw hat industry is a suitable side occupation when the handicraft textile industry in the nearby rural areas needs to find another way out after the liberation of industrial cities such as Tianjin. Therefore, the Party and government leading organs in Xian County, especially the Promotion Agency, should continue to vigorously lead and support it, conduct investigations and repairs of the old machines in the past, and strive to activate them in the favorable seasons of spring and summer. Supply and marketing cooperatives should also be organized to solve the supply and marketing difficulties in production.
　　In addition, most of the persons in charge of the factories are currently the main cadres in the village, and their treatment is the same as that of the machine workers. However, because they are busy with village work, they inevitably often miss work. Over time, this will cause dissatisfaction among the masses. In order to properly solve this problem, in addition to the cadres participating in the factory taking the initiative to spare time to carry out production, a method for calculating the work of factory employees should be further formulated, and dividends should be distributed according to the principle of equivalent value, based on work. This will strengthen the unity between workers and cadres and facilitate the consolidation and development of the factory.

### 商家林的草帽业　是手工纺织转业的出路，望当地政府更好扶植。

　　商家林的草帽业
  　是手工纺织转业的出路，望当地政府更好扶植。
    献县商家林的草帽业已有八十年的历史，最初只是编织草帽辫，销售国内各大城市。后来有的制成箱柜提包，经青岛、天津、上海等地运销国外。自民国九年本地学会制造成品以后，商家林的草帽业，开始得到新的发展。抗战前曾发展到八十五家草帽工厂，有机器二百一十架，工人六百多名，每天能织草帽八百四十打。每年春夏两季，各地商人赶来购货的络绎不绝。因此结草帽辫成了献县、交河、建国、河间、饶阳、青县等地许多农民的主要副业之一。当时参加这一生产的，只妇女就不下五万人。各村未出嫁的闺女都是靠自己编草帽辫的体己钱办理嫁妆。
    抗战后，由于敌伪摧残，大部机器被破坏，商家林草帽业遂全部垮台。
    献县解放后，民国三十六年春天，经工商局的积极组织，及冀中河务局、冀西建合商店的投资扶助，商家林的草帽业才开始恢复。但因资本少及机器一时难于修复，草帽业仍受季节性的限制，只是在每年春天销售成品的有利季节一织一散，不能经常生产。去冬献县推进社在商家林建立了分社，专门领导这一副业。通过村合作社的领导，组织群众合作性质的草帽工厂，发动群众入股，营利由股东和工人四六分红（工人四，股东六）并与机器户协商每盘机器算作股金五十元，不愿分红的蹬机器工人，每天除吃喝外挣三斤米的工资。为了解决资金的困难，由公营冀中裕东商店统一收买成品，并规定先交款后取货。第一月即交款一百一十六万元，订帽两千四百打。经过这样的扶植，草帽业日渐发展，群众先后入股的已有七百九十七户，共入股金十七万六千二百一十元，全村分别组成了四个工厂，工人七十四个，经常开动着五十六部机器，每天能出草帽一百九十六打，可得利九千八百元。商家林周围的位庄等三个村的十四盘机器也被带动了起来，皇亲庄等不少村庄也正在修整机器准备开工。
    现在周围数十里内村庄的农民，参加结草帽辫的已不下两万人，大家都说：“商家林的草帽工厂这一开工，咱们就有了活做了。”
    因为草帽业是献县一带人民的主要副业，机器还不能代替它，在天津等工业城市解放后，附近农村的手工纺织业正需另寻出路的时候，草帽业正是纺织转业的适当副业。因此，献县的党政领导机关，特别是推进社，应继续大力加以领导与扶植，将过去的旧有机器，进行调查修理，争取在春夏有利季节活动起来。并应组织供销合作社，以解决生产中的供销困难。
    此外目前各厂的负责人多是村里的主要干部，待遇和蹬机工人一样，但他们因忙于村中工作，难免常常误工，这样时间长了会造成群众的不满。为了适当解决这一问题，除参加工厂的干部主动抽空挤时间进行生产外，应进一步订出工厂职员的计工办法，根据等价两利，按工取值的原则分红。这样才能加强工人干部间的团结，利于工厂的巩固与发展。
