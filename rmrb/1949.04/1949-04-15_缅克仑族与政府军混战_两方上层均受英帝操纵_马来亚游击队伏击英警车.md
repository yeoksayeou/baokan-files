　　Karen Ethnic Group Clashes with Government Forces
    Both Sides' Upper Echelons Controlled by British Imperialism
    Malayan Guerrillas Ambush British Police Vehicle
    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 13th – According to American and British news agencies, the Karen insurgent forces in Burma continue to clash with the Thakin Nu government forces. In the central Burma region, the Burmese government forces captured Mandalay, Burma's second-largest city, on the 3rd of this month, which had been seized by the Karen mutiny forces on March 12th. In southern Burma, the Karen forces besieged at Insein, 10 miles north of Rangoon, since January 31st, have refused to reconcile with the Burmese government. According to a United Press report, Karen leader Saw Ba U Gyi traveled from Insein to Rangoon on the 5th to negotiate peace with the Burmese government and signed an agreement on the 6th. In the agreement, Thakin Nu agreed to "establish a committee to study the Karen's demand for the establishment of an autonomous state," while Saw Ba U Gyi agreed that the Karen forces would surrender their weapons to the Burmese government and then cooperate to oppose the people's forces in Burma. However, after Saw Ba U Gyi returned to Insein, the Karen forces refused the surrender ceremony scheduled for the 8th, and the war continued. According to reliable sources, the upper echelons of these two mutually attacking armies are being manipulated by British imperialists. British imperialists are using different faces and methods to manipulate this protracted conflict to achieve their goal of controlling Burma.
    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 13th – According to an Associated Press report citing an 11th communiqué from British forces in Singapore, Malayan People's Guerrillas ambushed two British police vehicles in Pahang state in central Malaya on the night of the 9th, killing one British police officer and two Malayan policemen. In the ensuing battle, another nine policemen were injured, and one was "missing."

　　缅克仑族与政府军混战
    两方上层均受英帝操纵
    马来亚游击队伏击英警车
    【新华社北平十三日电】据美英通讯社消息，缅甸克仑族叛乱部队继续与达钦努政府军混战。中缅方面缅政府军本月三日攻占了克仑族哗变部队于三月十二日攻入的缅甸第二大城曼德勒。南缅方面，自一月三十一日起即被包围于仰光以北十哩之英山的克仑族军，已拒绝与缅政府媾和。据合众社讯：克仑军首领索巴宇吉曾于五日自英山赴仰光与缅政府谈判媾和，并于六日签订协定。达钦努在协定中同意“设立委员会以研究克仑族所提成立自治邦之要求”，索巴宇吉则同意克仑军向缅政府缴械投降，然后合作反对缅甸的人民力量。但索巴宇吉返英山后，克仑军拒绝了预约于八日举行的投降仪式，战事遂继续进行。据可靠方面的观察，这两支互相攻击的军队的上层分子都受着英国帝国主义者的操纵。英国帝国主义者用不同的面目和手段操纵着这个绵延的冲突，来达到它的控制缅甸的目的。
    【新华社北平十三日电】据美联社引新加坡英军十一日公报称，马来亚人民游击队于九日夜在马来亚中部的彭亨州伏击英国警车二辆，毙英警官一人，马来亚警察二人。在随后发生的战斗中，另有警察九人受伤，一人“失踪”。
