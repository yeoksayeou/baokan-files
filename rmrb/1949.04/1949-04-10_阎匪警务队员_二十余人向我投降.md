　　Yan Bandit Police Officers
  　Over Twenty People Surrender to Me
    [Taiyuan Telegraph] On the night of March 21st, twenty-two members of the Shanxi Provincial Government Police Department of the Yan bandit stationed in Dongliuzhuang, led by captain Yi Liang, deputy captain Xu Haicheng, and instructor Zhao Xueming, arrived at Xiwu Village from their station and collectively surrendered to me. They brought with them fifteen rifles, three pistols, over seven hundred rounds of ammunition, and over twenty hand grenades. Those who requested to return home have been issued grain coupons and travel expenses and have been sent away separately. It is reported that this team was organized by Yang Zhengji, one of the special agent bosses of the Yan bandit, and was officially established in Dongliuzhuang on March 18th, attempting to infiltrate our Yangqu area to carry out sabotage. After we learned of this, we immediately issued a warning, ordering them to surrender, otherwise they would be completely annihilated. Under the shock of our power, the enemy surrendered with their weapons.
