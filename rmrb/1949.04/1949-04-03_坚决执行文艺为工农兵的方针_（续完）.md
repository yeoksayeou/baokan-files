Resolutely Implement the Policy of Literature and Art Serving Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers (Continued)
    Xiao San
    Naturally, due to objective environmental factors, and due to the fact that literary and art workers themselves still have many shortcomings, and have not yet been able to properly connect their creations with the creations of the people, this new art has not yet reached its due height. Many new creations are either just budding, experimental, or remain at a certain stage without further development and improvement. What is now offered to our worker brothers in the cities is far from good enough. In terms of themes, there are relatively few works that extensively and positively depict the labor enthusiasm of peasants in production after liberation and land reform, or that extensively and positively depict the heroic combat of revolutionary war and commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army—these are things we should self-examine, criticize, and strive to improve. We must never be complacent. But we must also never be self-deprecating, discouraged, or give up. Our direction is right. This preliminary effort of ours is meaningful. We must continue to work hard. Never let it go for the rest of our lives. For example, although we have now returned to the cities, we must never forget the countryside for a single day or moment (the fact that there is still a very vast rural area in China that has not been liberated is enough to illustrate that rural work cannot be ignored). We must continue to do rural work, rural cultural and artistic work, raise the culture of the broad masses of peasants who have been liberated, improve agricultural production technology... We must also continue to do cultural and artistic work for the troops, improve the culture of the troops, and strengthen the combat effectiveness of the troops, because "an army without culture is a stupid army and cannot win battles." The Chinese people's revolution, obtaining political power, and maintaining political power, all urgently require an army, and the People's Liberation Army urgently needs culture and art. If we don't do this, then we are forgetting our roots. — This is one aspect.
    On the other hand, some of our literary and art workers have now returned to the cities. Furthermore, if the People's Liberation War in Northeast, North China, and Central China was mostly about encircling the cities from the countryside, that is, we liberated the countryside first and then the cities; then in the future, south of the Yangtze River, we will probably liberate the cities first and then the countryside, and literary and art workers will first have to work in the cities. The city has a vast working class—the most concentrated, most organized, and most revolutionary class. Without this class, without the leadership of this class, the revolution cannot be victorious, and all the people cannot be liberated. Revolutionary literary and art workers must now work harder to serve the workers, connect with the workers, represent the workers, and depict the infinitely positive and heroic spirit of the working class, and depict their role as revolutionary leaders. This is also a matter of course. There is truly a vast and boundless world here! There are countless moving and inspiring deeds. Let us see how, for many years, the workers in the liberated areas have struggled hard under extremely difficult conditions, overcoming all obstacles, carrying out production, and supporting the front lines! How many workers directly participated in the revolutionary war, displaying infinite heroism, and are worthy of being outstanding children of the working class! How arduously and heroically did the workers in the KMT-controlled areas struggle against reactionary rule! How loyally and intelligently did the workers in the cities temporarily occupied by the KMT bandit troops and about to be recovered by the People's Liberation Army preserve machines and materials, prevent the bandit troops from sabotaging them, and protect this people's property, handing it over to the People's Liberation Army and the People's Government! After the People's Liberation Army entered the city, how actively did the workers support them, or quickly resume work, or still continue to work as usual! When they were suppressed and exploited by the KMT bandits, they went on strike, protested, and resisted... Once liberated, how enthusiastically and actively did they produce! In general, the workers in the liberated cities, in order to build the great cause, how bravely and vigorously, selflessly for the public, highly developed their labor enthusiasm, automatically worked overtime, saved money, reduced costs, and increased unprecedented output and quality! The workers, who were enslaved and oppressed slaves in the past, now feel that they are the masters of the factory! They are the masters of the new society! Isn't this change in psychology, emotion, and spirit a great revolution that has not happened in thousands of years? Isn't this the glorious victory of Marxism, Leninism, and Mao Zedong Thought? Isn't it very obvious that literary and art workers can find unlimited themes and draw boundless inspiration in this field?
    Let's go to the factories, mines, railways, and docks again! Go to learn from the workers, to experience their lives, learn their language, to understand them, become familiar with them, and integrate our own thoughts and feelings with their thoughts and feelings, and then write about them, paint them, perform and sing about them! In the past few years, our literary and art workers have been able to endure hardship and be hardworking in the countryside, make friends with peasants sincerely, and genuinely seek benefits for the peasants; from now on, when we go to the factories again, we will also be able to make friends with the workers sincerely and serve the workers genuinely. Is there any doubt about this?
    At the beginning of the founding of the Chinese Communist Party, we did some workers' literary and artistic activities, but they were very small. Later, in the ten years of civil war, the literary and artistic activities in the countryside and the army were also relatively small—at that time, the revolutionary cultural army was active in the cities, and there was no possibility of combining with the People's Army and the peasants. During the Anti-Japanese War, revolutionary literary and art workers continuously came to the People's Army and the countryside. After the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art, especially during the land reform, a large number of literary and art workers went to the countryside, and a large number of literary and art workers regularly worked in the army. But the literature and art for the workers were restricted and very small during this period. Now, we have the possibility to do a large number of workers' literary and artistic activities again. We have vast possibilities to fully realize the overall task of "serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers." Our overall goal is: to enable the broad masses of peasants, the broad masses of workers, and the armed workers and peasants—the masses of soldiers—to have their own culture and art, because "art belongs to the people. It should penetrate into the deepest roots of the broad masses of working people with its deepest roots. It should be understood by these masses and loved by them. It should link the feelings, thoughts, and aspirations of these masses and elevate them. It should awaken artists among them and develop them" (Lenin, see Zetkin's memoirs). To improve and further unite the relationship between the city and the countryside, the relationship between workers and peasants, under the new regime, in order to completely defeat the rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat-capitalism over the people, to complete the construction of new democracy in all aspects, and to increase the welfare of workers, peasants, and revolutionary intellectuals, this is the current political task of new democratic culture and art; this is the task of the construction of new democratic culture and art itself.
    Revolutionary cultural and artistic workers, work hard!
    The broad masses of students and friends in the intellectual circles of the city, join us in going to the camp of the working masses, and use your cultural weapons to serve the workers!
    Many artistic geniuses among the working people, come and write, perform, paint, and sing about yourselves! "Worker writers are not readily dropped from the sky, they only grow slowly in the process of writing. They just need to be bolder to do it, and they will learn to write after hitting a few snags." After reading these words of Stalin in the editorial of the inaugural issue of "Pravda" on May 5, 1912, we are infinitely excited, and we have even more confidence.

　　坚决执行文艺为工农兵的方针　（续完）
    萧三
    自然，由于客观环境的关系，由于文艺工作者自身还有很多缺点，还没有能够把自己的创造和人民的创造好好联结起来，这种新的艺术还没有达到它应有的高度，许多新的创造或则只是萌芽、尝试，或则停留在一定的阶段上而还没有得到更进一步的发展与提高，现在献给城市工人兄弟们看的还远不够美好，在主题方面，特别是描写农民在解放后和土改后积极生产的劳动热忱的作品，比较大规模地正面描写革命战争与解放军指战员的英勇作战的作品，都还很少——这些我们应该自我检讨、批评，力求进步。我们决不能自满。但是我们也决不能自卑、自馁、自弃。我们的这个方向是对的。我们这一初步的努力是有意义的。我们还要继续努力。一辈子也不放松它。比如我们现在虽然回到了城市，但绝不能一天一时忘掉乡村（中国还有非常广大的农村没有解放，就这一点，已够说明农村工作之不能忽视了）。我们还要继续作农村工作，作农村的文化文艺工作，提高那获得解放的广大农民群众的文化，改进农业生产技术……我们还要继续作部队的文化文艺工作，提高部队的文化，加强部队的战斗力，因为“没有文化的军队，是愚蠢的军队，是不能打胜仗的”，中国人民革命，取得政权，维持政权，都迫切需要军队，人民解放军迫切需要文化与文艺。如果我们不这样做，那就是忘本。——这是一方面。
    另一方面，我们一部分的文艺工作者现在又回到了城市。再则，假如人民解放战争在东北、华北以及在华中大都是以乡村包围城市，即我们先解放乡村，后解放城市；那么今后在长江以南我们大概先解放城市，后解放乡村，文艺工作者在那里首先就要在城市中工作。城市有广大的工人阶级——最集中、最有组织、最革命的阶级。没有这个阶级，没有这个阶级的领导，革命就不能胜利，全体人民就不能得到解放。革命的文艺工作者现在又要多多努力为工人服务，联系工人，表现工人，描写工人阶级无限积极英勇的精神，描写他作为革命领袖的作用，这又是天经地义的事。这里真是有一片广大无垠的天下！有无数可歌可泣的动人的事迹。我们试看，长年以来，解放区的工人是如何在极端困难的条件下，艰苦奋斗，克服一切障碍，进行生产，支援前线的！有多少工人直接参加革命战争，表现无限的英雄气概，不愧为工人阶级优秀子女的！在蒋管区的工人是如何艰苦、英勇地作反抗反动统治的斗争的！在蒋匪军一时占驻、解放军即将收复的城市工人是如何忠诚机智地保存机器、物资，阻止匪军破坏，将这人民财产保护起来，交给解放军与人民政府的！在解放军入城之后，工人们是如何积极拥护，或很快就恢复工作，或仍然全部照常开工的！他们在蒋匪镇压剥削时怠工、罢工、反抗……一经解放，他们是如何热烈积极生产的！在一般解放了的城市工人，为了建设大业，是如何英勇奋发、克己为公、高度发挥劳动热忱、自动加工、节约、减轻成本、提高前所未有的产量与质量的！工人，过去是被奴役、受压榨的奴隶，现在感觉自己是工厂的主人了！是新社会的主人了！这一心理、情感、精神的变化，不是千年未有的伟大的革命吗？这不是马克思、列宁主义和毛泽东思想的光辉的胜利吗？文艺工作者在这个领域内能发现无限的题材，能汲取无量的灵感，这还不非常明显吗？
    我们再到工厂里，矿山中，至铁路上，码头上去吧！去向工人学习，去体验他们的生活，学习他们的语言，去了解他们，熟悉他们，把自己的思想感情和他们的思想感情打成一片，然后写他们，画他们，演、唱他们吧！这几年以来，我们的文艺工作者在农村中能够吃苦耐劳、诚诚恳恳，和农民交朋友，切切实实替农民谋利益；从现在起，我们再到工厂去的时候，也同样能够诚诚恳恳和工人交朋友，切切实实为工人服务，这还有什么疑问吗？
    在中国共产党成立之初，我们作了些工人的文艺活动，但那是很微小的。后来十年内战中，农村和部队的文艺活动也是比较微小的——那时革命的文化大军是在城市活动，没有可能和人民军队与农民结合。抗战时期才不断有革命的文艺工作者来到人民军队和农村。延安文艺座谈会以后，特别是土改中，才有大批的文艺工作者下乡，大批的文艺工作者经常在部队中工作。但为工人的文艺在这时期是受了限制，而非常小的。现在呢，我们又有可能大量作工人的文艺活动了。我们有广大可能，来全面实现“为工农兵”的总任务了。我们总的目的是：要使广大的农民群众、广大的工人群众和武装的工农——兵士群众都有自己的文化文艺，因为“艺术是属于人民的。它应该凭自己最深的根走进广大劳动群众的最密层里去。它应该为这些群众所懂得，为他们所爱好。它应该联结这些群众的感觉、思想和愿望，提高他们。它应该在他们中间唤起艺术家和发展他们”（列宁，见蔡特金回忆）。要使城市与乡村的关系，工人与农民的关系，在新的政权下面日益改进和更加团结起来，以彻底打垮帝国主义、封建主义与官僚资本对人民的统治，完成新民主主义各方面的建设，增进工人、农民和革命知识分子的福利，这就是新民主主义文化文艺的当前政治的任务；这就是新民主主义文化文艺本身建设的任务。
    革命的文化文艺工作者们，努力吧！
    城市广大的学生群众和知识界的朋友们，和我们一道走向劳动群众的阵营，用自己的文化武器为劳动者服务吧！
    劳动人民中不少艺术的天才，你们自己来写、来演、来画、来歌唱自己吧！“工人作家不是现成地从天上掉下来的，他们只是在写作过程中慢慢成长的。只是需要更大胆地来干，碰几回钉子就会学会写作的”。读了斯大林在一九一二年五月五日“真理报”创刊号社论里的这些话，我们无量地兴奋，我们更有了信心。
