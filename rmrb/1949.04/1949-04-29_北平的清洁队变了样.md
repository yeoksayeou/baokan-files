The Cleansing Brigade of Beiping Has Changed
By our reporter Chen Ji

The Beiping Public Security Bureau Cleaning Brigade has a total of 1,750 members, distributed in seven districts in the city and five districts outside the city. They are organized into twelve district teams, responsible for cleaning every street and hauling away garbage accumulated by households.

Before the liberation of Beiping, the streets and lanes were filled with sewage and scattered paper.

And the cleansing brigade? From the headquarters to the district team leaders, there were layers of corruption, deduction of wages, acceptance of gifts, embezzlement of funds, and extortion. The team members were perfunctory in their work: after the dirt cart was pulled out, they would only load less than ten baskets before going to chat and rest; sometimes they would push the cart to their own homes to do other things. Therefore, garbage piled up like mountains in some places. Especially in the poor areas, because there was no "extra income," no one wanted to clean them, and these places became the gathering places for filth and garbage. After the People's Liberation Army entered the city of Beiping, the corrupt elements in the cleaning brigade could no longer thrive; after studying, they understood that it was now the people's city and began to establish a new style. In the past, each person could only pull four or five carts a day; now it has increased to seven or eight carts a day, and some have even reached twelve carts. When there are not enough carts, they even borrow carts to use. They are able to start and end work on time, without being lazy or making excuses to leave their posts. Wang Zhong, a member of the Sixth Team, wore out the handle of his cart, but still continued to pull it. The members of the Eleventh District Team went to the poor areas to haul away ashes and soil, and even worked overtime every Monday and Friday. Residents Liu Guangsen and Yao Kequan presented them with a banner with the words "Cleaning Model" to express their respect for their work enthusiasm. In the past, the automobile dirt hauling team could only haul seven or eight times a day, but now they average ten times a day. Because there are too few cars available now (only fourteen), the drivers have automatically repaired eight cars to use. After finishing work at 6:00 p.m., they also check the machine parts. In the past, the dirt cart team members were not organized, but now they have been organized separately. In order to avoid being late for meals, a food committee has been established, and everyone eats together. This not only does not interfere with work, but also allows time for study. Some of them have dug up guns, bullets, and hand grenades buried by Kuomintang secret agents in garbage dumps and have automatically handed them over to the public. This situation did not exist in the past.

After less than three months of everyone's efforts, the streets and lanes of Beiping have been completely renewed and are completely different from when Chiang Kai-shek occupied the city. However, some team members still retain many old habits, which need to be overcome. For example, Yang Guoshan and Cao Yongtian of Section 7 of the Second Team once asked residents for money and were severely criticized by the masses. For this reason, the team conducted publicity to inform the citizens that cleaning team members must not extort money from residents, nor are they allowed to accept gifts. Another is the so-called "ash and soil relocation": for example, someone from the First District Team once dumped the ash and soil they hauled into the Seventh District Team, which aroused the anger of other district teams. This must also be completely eliminated.

Some district team members told reporters: "When we ring the bell to ask residents to pour out the dirt, they don't come out; after we leave, they dump the garbage on the side of the road." This adds a lot of trouble to the cleaning work. In the previous period, due to the lack of cleaning tools, the general public did not pay enough attention to cleaning and hygiene, so the work of removing garbage has not yet been put on the right track. Now the Public Security Bureau will equip 1,000 dirt carts and increase the number of cars to 35. The comrade in charge of the cleaning brigade said: "There are enough tools, and the team members' work enthusiasm has been improved. As long as the general public can cooperate with us, we guarantee that Beiping will no longer be as dirty and filthy as it was in the Kuomintang era." In the past, Beiping had forty-six large garbage waiting fields, which were very smelly in the summer. Now even these waiting fields will become our target for clearing. The Cleaning Brigade plans to mobilize all team members to clean up these waiting fields starting on the 29th of this month, and hopes that the general public will assist in this work.

### 北平的清洁队变了样

　　北平的清洁队变了样
    本报记者  陈迹
    北平公安局清洁总队队员共有一千七百五十人，分布在市内七个区和市外五个区，组织成十二个区队，负责清扫每条街道，装拉住户积存拉圾。
    北平未解放前，街道巷衢，冀便横流，纸片纷飞。
    清洁队呢？从总队部到区队领导人员，层层贪污，扣薪水，受赠馈，吃空额，敲诈勒索。队员对工作是敷衍塞责：土车拉了出去，还没装上十箩筐，就去谈天休息；有时把车子推到自己的家里，去干别的事情。因此有些地方垃圾堆成了山。尤其是贫民区，因为没有“外水”，谁也不愿去打扫，这些地方就成了肮脏垃圾的汇集地。解放军进了北平城，清洁队中贪污分子吃不开了；经过学习，明白了现在是人民的城市，开始建立新的作风。过去每天每人只能拉四五趟车；现在每天增至七八车，最多竟有达到十二车的。车子不够时，还借车来使用。均能按时出班入班，不偷懒，也不借故离职。第六队队员王仲拉车把手都磨破了，还要继续拉下去。第十一区队队员到贫民区去拉灰土，每逢星期一、五还加班工作。住户刘光森、姚克泉为此特赠送了他们一面“清洁模范”的锦旗，对他们的工作热情表示敬意。汽车拉土队以前每天只能拉七八次，现在每天平均十次。因为现在能够使用的汽车太少（才十四辆），司机们便自动修理了八辆来使用。下午六点钟工作完了，他们还要检查机器零件。拉土车的队员过去没有组织，现在已分别组织起来。为了避免回去吃饭误了时间，特地成立了伙食委员会，大家合伙吃饭。既不误工作，又能抽出时间学习。他们有的在垃圾堆里挖出了国民党特务埋藏的枪械子弹和手榴弹，都自动交给公家。这种情形，在过去也是没有的。
    经过大家不到三个月的努力，北平的街巷现已焕然一新，和蒋占时迥然不同了。不过有一些队员还残留着不少旧作风，急须继续克服。如第二队七段的杨国山和曹永田曾经向住户要钱，受到了群众严厉批评。为此，该队曾对市民进行宣传，说明清洁队员绝对不能向住户敲诈，也不容许接受赠馈。还有是所谓“灰土搬家”：如第一区队有人曾把自己拉的灰土倒在第七区队里，引起了其他区队的愤怒，这也须彻底清除。
    有些区队队员向记者说：“我们摇铃要住户倒土的时候，居民不出来；等我们走了之后，他们却把垃圾倒在路旁。”这给清洁工作增加了许多麻烦。前一时期由于清洁工具不够应用，广大市民群众没有十分注意到清洁卫生，因此清除垃圾的工作还没有走上正轨。现在公安局将配备好一千辆土车，并把汽车增至三十五辆。负责清洁总队的同志说：“工具够用了，队员的工作热情提高了，只要广大市民能够和我们配合起来，我们保证北平市不会再象国民党时代那样肮脏龌龊。”过去平市有四十六个大的垃圾待运场，到了暑天，非常难闻。现在连这些待运场也将成为我清除的对象了。清洁总队预定在本月二十九日开始动员各队员清除这些待运场，希望广大市民来协助这个工作。
