　　[Jizhong Electric] In the 11th District of Xian County, twenty villages near the Hutuo River are flooded every year. The 17,200-plus disaster victims mainly rely on 1,669 iron looms and 9,000 spinning wheels to maintain their livelihoods. Recently, as fine cloth has become more common, the local cloth has been affected. In the past month, under the leadership and assistance of the county's Production Promotion Cooperative, seven villages in Fengtu have switched to weaving sacks. The Promotion Cooperative used 5,000 jin of cotton and 200,000 yuan in RMB to exchange for sacks, and has now received 22,470 sacks. It has also sent three salespersons to Beiping and Northeast China to find long-term sales channels.
