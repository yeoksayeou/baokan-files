　　Notification from the North China People's Government
　　　　　(I)
　　Strictly Prohibit the Export of Antiques and Books
    The North China People's Government, in order to prohibit the export of antiques and books, hereby orders all administrative offices, provincial governments, directly governed municipal governments, and Tianjin Customs:
    It is found that during the Chiang Kai-shek bandit regime, officials and merchants colluded to steal and export our country's antiques and books, causing immense damage to our country's cultural heritage. Now that Tianjin and Beijing have been liberated and land and sea transportation is open, in order to prevent the theft and export of antiques and books, from the date of this order, all antiques related to archeology, history, paleontology and other cultural fields, and all books older than eighty years, are strictly prohibited from being exported abroad (except for those specifically permitted by the government for exchange). Regardless of whether the violator is Chinese or foreign, in addition to confiscation of their items, they will be prosecuted for theft. In addition to separately ordering the customs and inspection stations to earnestly inspect and implement this order, it is hoped that you will comply and instruct your subordinates to implement it accordingly!
    　　　　(II)
