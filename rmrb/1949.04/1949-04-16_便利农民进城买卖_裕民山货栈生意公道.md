To facilitate farmers buying and selling in the city, the Yumin Mountain Goods Store, since moving from Wanping to Ping City, has provided great convenience to farmers and merchants selling mountain goods in the city. To expand its business, it moved to 17 Yangmeizhu Diagonal Street, Qianmen Wai on April 12th. In half a month, it has purchased 24,537.5 jin of mountain goods (such as apricot kernels and peach kernels). The store indeed provides many conveniences to farmers and merchants: (1) In the past, whether farmers or merchants came to the city to buy and sell, they were often deceived by merchants, such as being forced to accept lower prices. However, the Yumin Mountain Goods Store offers fair deals and the purchase price is slightly higher than the market price. For example, for apricot kernels, the store's purchase price is 80 yuan, which is 5 yuan higher than the market price. (2) Some merchants in the market are picky when buying goods and even deduct a bit at the end. Yumin not only does not have these bad habits of merchants, but also pays immediately, which is very convenient for farmers and merchants. (3) Some merchants in the market buy with large scales and sell with small scales. The store's scales are fair, with consistent measurements for buying and selling. (4) It also provides accommodation and meals, which is very convenient, just like staying at home.

The store's purpose is to facilitate the exchange of agricultural products and daily necessities between farmers and the city, reducing the exploitation by intermediate merchants, so it is very popular with farmers. Currently, its business includes consignment, storage, and sales.

　　便利农民进城买卖
  　裕民山货栈生意公道
    【本报讯】裕民山货栈自宛平迁至平市后，即给进城卖山货的农民或商贩很大便利；为扩大业务，已于四月十二日迁至前外杨梅竹斜街十七号。半月来，即收买山货（杏仁桃仁等）达二万四千五百三十七斤半。该栈确实给农民商贩很多方便：（一）过去无论农民商贩来城买卖，常受商人的欺骗如压低价格等等，而裕民山货栈买卖公道，收价比市价稍高，如杏仁，该栈收价为八十元，即比市价高出五元。（二）市上有些商人买货时还要挑剔，临了还要扣点零头；裕民不但没有这种商人恶习，并马上可以取钱，对农民商贩非常方便。（三）市场上有些商人用大秤买进小秤卖出，该栈斤秤公道，进出一致。（四）并可在该栈住宿、吃饭，非常方便，如同住家一样。
    该栈目的在便利农民与城市交换生产品与日用品减轻中间商人剥削，所以甚得农民欢迎。现在业务为代收，代存，代销。
