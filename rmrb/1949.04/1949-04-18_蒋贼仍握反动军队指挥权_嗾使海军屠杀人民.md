　　Chiang Kai-shek Still Holds Command of Reactionary Troops
　　Instigates Navy to Massacre People
    [Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, 16th] On the 13th, the Kuomintang's 54th Army near Zhenjiang, aboard the "Weihai," "Yongxiang," and "Yongjia" ships, departed from Dagang, east of Zhenjiang, and landed at the southern end of Lao Zhou in the center of the river, attacking Gaoqiao on Lao Zhou and the People's Liberation Army positions to its north. On the same day, five Kuomintang warships shelled the Sanjiangying area on the north bank of the Yangtze River northeast of Lao Zhou, causing enormous losses to the residents. According to a Reuters dispatch from Nanjing on the 14th, this attack by the Kuomintang army occurred after a telephone conversation with Chiang Kai-shek in Xikou. This fact fully proves that the number one war criminal Chiang Kai-shek still holds the command of the remaining reactionary Kuomintang troops.

　　蒋贼仍握反动军队指挥权
  　嗾使海军屠杀人民
    【新华社北平十六日电】十三日，镇江附近的国民党五十四军曾乘“威海”、“永翔”、“永嘉”三舰由镇江以东的大港出发，在江心的老洲南端登陆，并向老洲上的高桥及其以北的解放军阵地攻击。同日，国民党军舰五艘向老洲东北长江北岸的三江营地区炮击，居民损失浩大，据路透社南京十四日消息：国民党军的此项攻击发生在与溪口的蒋介石用电话商谈之后。这个事实充分证明第一号战争罪犯蒋介石现在仍握有国民党残余反动军队的指挥权。
