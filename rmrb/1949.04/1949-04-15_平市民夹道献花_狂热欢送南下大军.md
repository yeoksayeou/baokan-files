　　Ping Citizens Line Streets to Present Flowers
　　Enthusiastically Send Off Southern-Bound Troops
　　[Our Newspaper] Yesterday (the 14th), the citizens of Beiping enthusiastically sent off the 41st Army, which had been guarding Beiping, as it headed south. Because the route of the march had been announced in advance, workers, students, ordinary citizens, and government employees poured in from all directions to Dongdan North Street, Beichizi Road, Chang'an Avenue, and even outside Guang'anmen, waiting along the streets. At 7:30 AM, the 41st Army departed in two routes: one route went through Dongsi Intersection, Dongdan, North Street, Chang'an Avenue to Guang'anmen; the other went through Beichizi Road, Chang'an Avenue, out of Guang'anmen. As soon as the troops set off, they entered a hard-to-navigate procession of well-wishers and a chorus of enthusiastic songs. Whether on Dongdan North Street or Beichizi Road, when the red flags with the words "Attacks Bravely, Defends Tenaciously" and "The People's Army" appeared, the colorful flags of the well-wishers on both sides waved enthusiastically, and the singing and cheers grew even louder. Especially when the Beiping Xinhua Broadcasting Station broadcasted "March of the Eighth Route Army," "Forward... Forward... We are an invincible force...," the soldiers smiled, the workers smiled, the students smiled, everyone smiled. There were too many people. In several places, streetcars stopped, cars stopped, and pedicabs also stopped. From Dongsi to Dongdan, six streetcars stopped within half an hour.
　　Along the way, workers, students, and ordinary citizens busily presented the troops with precious lilac and white pear blossoms. When the troops reached Xuanwumen, He Binlun and Hou Wenyuan from the No. 11 District National Primary School rushed into the ranks to shake hands with the troops one last time. The eyes of the soldiers shaking hands were moist, but some people also stuck the colorful flags they were holding onto the muzzles of the soldiers' guns, shining with "Go to the South, Liberate All of China!"
　　The troops marched forward. Some people who wanted to see them off further were often stopped by another line of well-wishers and could only stare blankly as the troops marched away.
　　[Another Dispatch] The various regiments of the 122nd Division of the 41st Army, the Beiping Garrison troops that began heading south yesterday (the 14th), are scheduled to assemble at their original garrisons at 7:00 AM this morning and depart south in three routes: one route out of Xizhimen, one route out of Fuchengmen, and one route out of Fuxingmen. The 122nd Division of the said army is also scheduled to depart south tomorrow (the 16th).

　　平市民夹道献花
  　狂热欢送南下大军
    【本报讯】昨（十四）日北平市民狂热欢送警卫北平的四十一军南下，因为事先宣布了行军的路线，在东单北大街和北池子路，长安街直到广安门外，从四面八方涌来了工人、学生、市民、机关工作人员，等候在街头。七时半，四十一军分两路，一路经东四口、东单、北大街、长安街至广安门；一路经北池子路、长安街出广安门。部队一出发后，就进入了一条难以通过的欢送行列和一片热情的歌声里。无论在东单北大街或在北池子路，当写着“攻得英勇，守得顽强”，“人民的军队”的红旗出现时，两旁的欢送的彩旗就热烈的挥动着，歌声、欢呼声更响亮起来，尤其当北平新华广播电台播出“八路军进行曲”“向前……向前……我们是一支不可，战胜的力量……”时，部队笑了，工人笑了，学生笑了，所有的人笑了。人太多了，在好几个地方，电车停了，汽车停了，三轮车也停了，从东四到东单，半小时内，就有六辆电车停下来了。
    沿路上都有工人、学生、市民，忙着给部队献着珍贵的丁香花、白梨花，当队伍走至宣武门时，他们手中、背包上、甚至驮炮的马头上，也插上了鲜花。到菜市口时，十一区的国民小学何宾伦、侯文元赶到队伍中，和队伍要握最后的一次手，握手战士的眼睛都润湿了，但是又有一些人又把拿着的彩旗，给战士插在枪口上，闪耀着：“打到江南去，解放全中国！”
    队伍向前行进着，有些要远送的人，常常被另一支欢送的行列阻止了，只能在队伍走远了，呆呆的望着。
    【又讯】昨日（十四日）开始南下的平市卫戍部队第四十一军一二二师各团，定于今晨七时由原驻地整队分三路出发，一路出西直门，一路出阜城门，一路出复兴门南下，该军所属一二二师亦定于明日（十六日）出发南下。
