　　Afforestation Movement in Xizheng Village, Xingtang
　　●Zhang Guokai● Xizheng Village Greatly Needs Afforestation
　　Xizheng Village, located in the southeastern part of the large sandy wasteland of the Fifth District of Xingtang, has more than 1,200 mu of sandy land susceptible to wind erosion, accounting for more than 69 percent of the village's 1,734 mu of cultivated land. Although almost the entire village is paddy field (with only 6.5 mu of dry land), it suffers increasingly from wind and sand damage year after year. In 1947 and 1948, two wells in the northeast of the village disappeared without a trace due to being buried by wind and sand, and seven wells were temporarily unusable. Therefore, when the cadres I led in afforestation arrived in the village, they quickly heard calls for afforestation. An old woman said worriedly, "There's nothing we can do about it! We planted two mu of wheat, and half of it was covered by wind and sand!" Fan Laoze said anxiously, "My land is all in the northeast of the village. If we don't build windbreaks, my family will have nothing to eat!"
　　Propagandizing Forest Protection, Breaking Down Concerns About Afforestation
　　Although the villagers urgently demanded tree planting and afforestation, they were afraid of damage by children and trampling by sheep, and dared not plant trees; at the same time, after the large-scale logging and destruction by the Japanese invaders in the past, there was a severe shortage of saplings. The villagers' concerns about damage by children and trampling by sheep arose in this way: because of the poor work style of a few cadres in the village, their children picked up firewood, stole and cut down small trees and dug up tree roots, and sheep trampled small trees, the villagers dared not speak out. The village's forest protection regulations not only had nothing to do with the village cadres themselves, but even the cadres' relatives and close friends shielded each other; some villagers therefore spitefully cut down their own trees.
　　In view of this situation, the cadres I led in afforestation used mealtimes or planned street corner chats to carry out in-depth propaganda as much as possible. The village's blackboard newspaper and primary school students also carried out propaganda, repeatedly explaining the government's policy of protecting forests and trees. It was specifically explained that if anyone damages trees, no matter who it is, they must be dealt with in accordance with the village's forest protection regulations, and serious offenders will be handed over to the government for punishment! If someone doesn't dare to speak out in the village, they can also report directly to the district. (Note: In order to thoroughly solve the problem, in addition to the above-mentioned propaganda, certain poorly styled village cadres should be educated and criticized individually or face-to-face through certain organizations, so that they can correct their past bad work styles. - Editor)
　　After four days of propaganda and deliberation, the villagers' concerns began to be dispelled. For example, Fan Wu'ni, who erected a "windbreak ridge" (i.e., a ridge of good soil to block wind and sand) on the edge of her field the year before last, had plowed it flat and planted crops. Now, after propaganda and mobilization, Fan Wu'ni cut down some willow branches from her own trees and bought more than 50 jin of poplar branches, working with others to build a forest at the "windbreak ridge". Some said, "We have regulations, and the government is backing us up, there's nothing we can't protect!" On February 5th and 6th, people bought 949 jin of tree branches from three families. An old woman hitched up a cart and borrowed more than 300 jin of poplar branches from relatives in Xingjia Village. Fan Laoze, who dared not plant pear trees a few years ago for fear of damage by children, also transplanted 100 Du trees from relatives and friends, preparing to cultivate a pear orchard. According to statistics, a total of 3,228 trees were planted on the 5th and 6th. Three relatively long windbreak forest belts have been created; the method is to plant in each family's field along the "hundred family field edges" (i.e., the field edges of each family that are close to each other) according to the terrain. For example, on the east side of the village, on the oblique road, 21 households planted in this way, forming a windbreak forest that is one and a half li long. According to the villagers, if these trees grow into large trees, they can protect more than 300 mu of cultivated land from wind and sand damage. This method is not only suitable for the entire plan of building windbreak forests, but also easily gives play to each individual's enthusiasm and sense of responsibility in mastering technology, and the survival rate of the trees is relatively high.
　　Organizing a Forest Protection Committee, Upholding Forest Protection Regulations
　　After the village's afforestation movement initially began, in order to have planned control and leadership, a "Forest Protection Committee" was formed, consisting of 12 people including the village head, branch secretary, squad leader, primary school teacher, and villagers who were active and experienced in afforestation (the primary school teacher mainly took charge of forest protection propaganda), to lead the forest protection and afforestation work for a long time.
　　At the same time, a mass meeting was held to re-discuss the forest protection regulations. The villagers unanimously proposed: if someone violates the rules three times, they will be sent to the district for handling. Some villagers also suggested: "The fine should not be too high, it won't work if it's too high." Therefore, it was stipulated that "Those who steal and cut down small trees and jujube slopes (i.e., jujube tree clusters), the amount is one handful, fined 10 jin of rice, more than one handful or stealing a small tree as thick as a hand, fined 30 jin of rice; the newly built windbreak forest, whether the owner or others, shall not be allowed to peel bark, if someone violates twice, they shall be fined double the amount according to the above." The branch secretary also made a guarantee on the spot: if the children of party members violate the rules, the forest protection regulations will be strictly enforced; the leader of the poor peasant group also proposed at the cadre meeting: guarantee that if the children of poor peasant families violate the rules, they will resolutely handle the matter according to the forest protection regulations!
　　Continuing to Strengthen Forest Protection Work, Expanding the Afforestation Movement
　　The villagers of Xizheng Village have initially established confidence in forest protection work, but some are still somewhat skeptical. For example, some said, "Maybe we can suppress the red dust this year!" Or they said, "If we can't protect it this time, we will never plant trees again!" There are also individuals who don't dare to interfere when they see children digging up tree roots. Therefore, it is still necessary to continue to strengthen the leadership of forest protection work, so that the afforestation movement can be expanded in the future. Now some villagers say, "As long as we can protect it for these few months, afforestation in the dog days will not be a problem." At the same time, the village has made preliminary plans for afforestation during the rainy season; if we can do a good job in forest protection now, it will not only enable the village's afforestation movement to continue to develop, but also affect the development of the entire sandy wasteland afforestation movement in the area, because the farmers in the nearby sandy wasteland villages are all watching whether the windbreak forest in Xizheng Village can survive.

### 行唐西正村的造林运动

　　行唐西正村的造林运动
    ●张国楷● 　 西正村很需要造林
    行唐五区大片沙荒东南部的西正村，有犯风的沙地一千二百多亩，占全村耕地一千七百三十四亩的百分之六十九以上。虽然全村几乎全部都是水地（旱地只有六亩半），但因大部犯风沙，受害一年比一年严重。一九四七和四八两年，村东北的水井，因风沙填埋，已有两眼不现痕迹，七眼暂不能使用了。因此，我领导造林的干部到村就很快听到了要求造林的反映。一个老太太忧愁的说：“这可没办法呀！种了二亩麦子，着风沙压了一半！”范老泽着急的说：“俺家的地都在村东北，再不造挡风林，俺家就吃不上饭啦！” 　 宣传护林，打破造林的顾虑
    虽然该村农民迫切要求植树造林，但又怕小孩们破坏和羊群的糟蹋，而不敢造林；同时，在过去日寇大量砍伐破坏后，非常缺乏树秧。农民怕小孩们破坏及羊群糟蹋的顾虑是这样产生的：由于这村少数干部作风不好，他们的孩子拾柴偷砍小树和刨树根，以及羊群糟蹋小树，农民不敢说，村里规定的护林公约，不但形成与村干部自己没有关系，而且连干部的亲友等知己人，也互相包庇；有的农民就因此睹气把自己的树砍掉了。
    根据这种情况，我领导造林的干部，就利用吃饭时或有计划的街头谈天，尽量深入宣传，村里的黑板报和小学生也宣传，反复解释政府保护林木的政策。更具体说明：如有破坏林木者，不论何人，一定要按村护林公约处理，重者送交政府惩办！有的如在本村不敢说，也可直接到区反映。（按：为了彻底解决问题，除进行上述宣传外，还应经过一定组织，对某些作风不好的村干部，个别的或当面的进行教育和批评，使其改正过去不好作风。——编者）
    经过了四天的宣传酝酿后，农民的顾虑开始解除了。如前年有人在范五妮地头折起的“挡风岭”（即用好土垒起一条土岗子，以挡风沙），他已耕平种了庄稼，现在经宣传动员后，范五妮砍了自己一部柳树枝、又买了五十多斤杨树枝，配合着别人在“挡风岭”处造起林来；有的说：“咱们有公约，政府又给撑腰，没有保护不住的！”二月五、六号两天，人们就买了三家的树枝九百四十九斤。一个老太太，套着大车到邢家庄，从亲戚家借了杨树枝三百多斤。前几年怕小孩破坏而不敢栽梨树的范老泽，也从亲友家移栽了一百棵杜树，准备培植梨园。据统计：五、六号两天共栽了三千二百二十八棵。较长的挡风林带，已造成了三条；方式都是按照地形在“百家地头”（即各家并拢相邻的地头）各栽各地。如村东斜道上，有二十一户这样栽，连成了一里半长的一条档风林，据该村农民谈：如长成大树，可保护耕地三百多亩不再受风沙之害。这种方式，不但适合造防风林的整个计划，而且容易发挥各个人的积极性和认真掌握技术的责任心，树的成活率比较高。 　 组织护林委员会，坚持护林公约
    该村造林运动初步开展起来后，为了有计划的掌握领导，由村长支部书记、中队长、小学教员和造林积极而有经验的农民等十二人，组成了“护林委员会”（小学教员主要掌握护林宣传）长期领导护林造林工作。
    同时召开了群众大会，重新讨论了护林公约。农民一致提出：如果连犯三次，就送区处理。又有的农民提议：“罚款不要太高，太高了行不通。”因而规定：“偷砍小树和酸枣坡子（即酸枣树丛）者，数量一把，罚米十斤，一把以上或偷一手粗的小树者，罚米三十斤；新建造的挡风林，不论本主或他人，一律不得削条子，如果连犯两次，则按以上罚款加倍处罚。”支部书记也当场提出保证：如果党员家的孩子犯了，同样按护林公约严格执行；贫农团长也在干部会上提出：保证贫农家的孩子犯了也坚决按护林公约办事！ 　 继续加强护林工作，扩大造林运动
    西正村农民对护林工作的信心。是初步树立了，但有的还是多少有些怀疑。如有的说：“今年也许能压住红！”或者说：“这回再要保护不住，永辈子不再栽树啦！”个别的也还有见了小孩刨树根不敢干涉的。因此，还须继续加强领导护林工作，以便使今后造林运动得以扩大。现在该村有些农民就说：“只要这几个月能保护住。伏天造林不成问题。”同时该村已作出了雨季造林的初步计划；如果现在能把护林工作作好，则不但会使该村造林运动继续开展，而且会影响到该地区整个沙荒造林运动的开展，因为附近沙荒村的农民，都在观望着西正村的挡风林，到底能否存在得住。
