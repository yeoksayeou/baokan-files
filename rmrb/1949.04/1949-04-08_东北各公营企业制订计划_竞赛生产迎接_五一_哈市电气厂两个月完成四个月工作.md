Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 6th—State-owned enterprises in Northeast China are universally launching a great production competition movement to welcome "May Day" Labor Day. The Harbin Electric Repair Factory has completed four months of production tasks in two months since the competition began on February 1st. The Shenyang Chemical Factory completed its March production plan a week ahead of schedule. The bleaching powder department of the factory originally planned to produce 90 tons of bleaching powder in March, but it produced 110 tons by March 24 (the highest monthly output during the puppet Manchukuo period was 108 tons). The monthly output of hydrochloric acid in the factory has reached 118 tons, exceeding the output of the puppet Manchukuo era by 28 tons. The repair department is striving to complete the repair plan for the first half of 1949 two months ahead of schedule by "May Day". In addition to ensuring the completion of the predetermined plan, the soap department is also preparing to specially produce one ton of high-quality soap printed with the words "Labor Model" for "May Day" rewards for labor models in various enterprises. The Second Mine of the Third Coal Mine Area in Northeast China has adopted the method of individuals and teams setting plans, and conducting competitions with the pit mouth as the unit. In the first eight days of March, the total output of the mine reached 3,216 tons, exceeding the planned target by 22 percent. During the competition, the First Coal Mine Area of the mine made great improvements in mining methods. For example, due to the change in mining methods, the daily output of a coal mining cave in the first pit increased from more than 100 tons to more than 200 tons, and the mining rate increased from 30 percent to 60 percent. Since the launch of the competition in the Sunjiawan Mine of the Fuxin Coal Mine Bureau, the amount of coal mined has increased from an average of three tons per person per day to six tons, and the amount of coal mined by worker Cui Yi has increased to ten tons. Thanks to the timely commendation and criticism through blackboards and the active improvement of workers' meals in the Northeast Woolen Mill during the competition movement, both output and quality have improved. One shift in the cotton weaving department of the factory increased its daily output of cotton cloth from 140 bolts to 200 bolts. In addition, the Shenyang Railway Bureau's locomotive depot guarantees that the two sections will complete the safety journey plan of 200,000 kilometers in the 40 days before "May Day". The Jinzhou Railway Bureau's locomotive depot is striving to complete two typical locomotives in early April. The Chengde Electric Power Bureau plans to add 1,000 electric lights before "May Day" and install all the street lights in the city. The Harbin Tram Factory guarantees to produce 33 trams before "May Day" and restore the third line to traffic. In other industrial cities such as Andong, Jilin, Changchun, Qiqihar, and Mudanjiang, employees of state-owned enterprises in railways, military industries, textiles, rubber, papermaking, and electric power are also working hard to complete their competition plans.

  　竞赛生产迎接“五一”
    哈市电气厂两个月完成四个月工作
    【新华社沈阳六日电】东北各地公营企业普遍展开生产大竞赛运动，以迎接“五一”劳动节。哈尔滨电气修理厂自二月一日开始竞赛以来，两个月内便完成了四个月的生产任务。沈阳化学工厂三月份生产计划已提前一周完成。该厂漂白粉部门原计划在三月份生产漂白粉九十吨，但至三月二十四日即生产了一百一十吨（伪满时最高月产量为一百零八吨）。该厂盐酸月产量已达一百一十八吨，超过伪满时代的产量二十八吨。修理部正争取在“五一”时实现提前两个月完成一九四九年上半年的修理计划。肥皂部门除保证完成预定的计划外，还准备特制一吨印有“劳动模范”字样的上等肥皂，以供各企业“五一”奖励劳动模范之用。东北第三煤矿区第二矿采取个人、小组订计划，以坑口为单位进行竞赛的办法。在三月上旬的八天中，全矿产量达三千二百一十六吨，超过预定计划的百分之二十二。该矿第一煤矿区竞赛期间在采掘方法上有很大的改进。如第一坑一个挖煤洞由于改变采掘法，日产量由一百余吨增至二百余吨，采掘率由百分之三十增至百分之六十。阜新煤矿局孙家湾矿自展开竞赛以来，采煤量已从每日每人平均三吨增至六吨，工人崔义的采煤量增至十吨。东北毛织厂由于在开展竞赛运动中经过黑板报及时进行表扬和批评，同时积极改善工人伙食，产量质量均有提高。该厂棉织部一个班即由日产棉布一百四十匹增至二百匹。此外，沈阳铁路局机务段保证两段在“五一”前的四十天内完成二十万公里的安全行走计划。锦州铁路局机务段争取在四月上旬完成两台典型机车。承德电业局计划在“五一”前增加电灯一千盏，同时装好全市路灯。哈尔滨电车厂保证在“五一”前出车三十三台，并恢复第三线通车。其他工业城市如安东、吉林、长春、齐齐哈尔、牡丹江等的铁路、军工、纺织、胶皮、造纸、电业等公营企业职工亦正积极为完成竞赛计划而努力。
