[Taihang News] The Jixi Forestry and Animal Husbandry Promotion Society was established on April 1st to uniformly lead and promote forestry and animal husbandry in various counties of Jixi. The society is divided into three sections: general affairs management, forestry promotion, and animal husbandry promotion. This year's work plan focuses on Shahe County. The work content includes: (1) In terms of forestry: conducting forest surveys, determining forest rights, dividing forest areas, establishing forest protection organizations, developing nurseries, establishing an economic forest farm under the society, and assisting the government in organizing the masses to carry out autumn afforestation, creating three flood prevention forests to protect Shahe County and the Pinghan Railway. (2) In terms of animal husbandry: conducting livestock surveys, establishing breeding stations, veterinary stations, and medical cooperatives, organizing local veterinarians, holding regular veterinary symposiums to study methods for preventing animal diseases, and providing treatment. Purchasing 250 head of high-quality female livestock and lending them to the masses to breed livestock and solve the problem of insufficient animal power for the masses. (Xue Xin Nan)

[Jinan News] Baixiang recently held a production meeting to study the issue of seed and loan distribution, determining that seed loans should be distributed according to soil conditions. For example, if peanuts grow well in a certain area, more peanut seeds should be loaned; if cotton grows well in another area, more cotton seeds should be loaned. Mechanical egalitarianism is opposed. Furthermore, due to the large number of paddy fields in the county, there is a shortage of waterwheels among the masses. According to incomplete statistics, there are 419 broken waterwheels in the county urgently needing repair. The Jinan Water Conservancy Promotion Society supports the county promotion society in lending a large number of waterwheels. The county promotion society's iron factory can produce one raw iron waterwheel per day, and one wrought iron waterwheel every three days. It has now produced 50 raw iron waterwheels and 8 wrought iron waterwheels, which will be loaned to farmers in large quantities. At the same time, the masses are being mobilized to repair damaged waterwheels in large numbers. To solve the difficulty for the masses in "pulping" waterwheel buckets, the county promotion society has also loaned 1,000 jin of tung oil. Specific regulations for various loans: calculated based on the actual price of cloth at the time, to be repaid after the wheat harvest; those with individual difficulties can postpone repayment until after the autumn harvest, and those who borrow peanut seeds will repay with peanuts after the autumn harvest. The above funds and materials are now being allocated to various villages. (Tu Jiang)
