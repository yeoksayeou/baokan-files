　　Chinese People's Revolutionary Military Commission
  　Provisional Regulations on Railway Military Transportation
    (These regulations will be implemented from April 10th)
  　Chapter I General Provisions
    Article 1 Railways are a national enterprise and an integral part of the People's Liberation War structure. The purpose of these regulations is to ensure the smooth flow of railway military transportation while ensuring the rational use of railway transportation without wasting railway transport capacity.
    Article 2 Military transportation is the primary task of the railway. In the military transportation plan, the Ministry of Railways unconditionally executes the orders of the Chinese People's Revolutionary Military Commission (hereinafter referred to as the Military Commission) to ensure the safety, speed, and convenience of military transportation.
    Article 3 Military transportation must emphasize unity and discipline. All levels of the military must strictly abide by the general military transportation plan and established rules and regulations of the railway formulated by the Military Commission and the Ministry of Railways. All levels of the military must ensure that vehicles are fully manned and loaded, and loaded and unloaded quickly. Except for military transportation approved by the Military Commission to adapt to front-line operations, and special emergency military transportation personally reviewed and approved by the heads of each level of military region and field army and their logistics departments, no emergency military transportation or special train transportation may be requested.
    Article 4 People's railways are gradually moving onto the right track. Past free preferential treatment and other methods will be abolished. From now on, all transportation, including military transportation, will be charged.
  　Chapter II Definition of Military Transportation
    Article 5 Transportation for the purpose of troop transfer, replenishment, combat, military industry, military supplies, military ordnance, and military medicine by the various organs directly under the Military Commission, various field armies, corps headquarters, armies, military regions, military sub-regions, and armed forces above independent regiments is considered military transportation. Transportation required by troops for the purpose of industrial and agricultural production or exchange of materials, transportation required by local party and government organs, the deployment of local armed forces below the county level and town public security personnel and the supplies they need, and transportation required by various public enterprises are not within the scope of military transportation.
  　Chapter III Differentiation of Military Transportation Handling
    Article 6 Large-scale (one train or more at a time) military transportation required by the emergency deployment and combat plans of the Military Commission and the headquarters of each field army shall be directly submitted to the Ministry of Railways of the Military Commission by the field army or first-level military region headquarters for joint planning. This transportation plan shall be notified by the headquarters and the Ministry of Railways to the relevant administrative units according to the system. After receiving the notice or telegram, each administrative unit shall contact the designated railway general bureau, management bureau, branch bureau, and station for handling according to the plan; before receiving the joint notice or joint telegram, it shall not negotiate vehicles on its own to avoid repeated allocation of vehicles, delay transportation, or make the transportation plan impossible to realize.
    (Note) When the station receives the joint notice or telegram of railway military transportation, it must keep it carefully. After the person holding the military transportation certificate (the unit requesting transportation of troops and military supplies) arrives, it shall handle all procedures in accordance with the regulations.
    Article 7 Mass replenishment of front-line labor and material supplies, such as weapons, ammunition, grain, firewood, vegetables, bedding, equipment, transportation, communications, and equipment and daily necessities used by military medical personnel, directly according to the emergency deployment and combat plans of the Military Commission, each field army, and each first-level military region headquarters, shall be handled by the headquarters and the Ministry of Railways in accordance with the method in Article 6.
    Article 8 The transportation of wounded, laborers, prisoners, and captured goods from the front to the rear shall be handled by the headquarters' stationed organs, or offices, or designated agent organs, by contacting the railway general bureau, management bureau, branch bureau, and station for vehicles. These vehicles shall be given priority in allocation and loading.
    Article 9 The transportation of troops maintaining law and order in the rear, the deployment of combat troops at the front, and the transportation of material supplies, the transfer of wounded soldiers to hospitals, and the transportation of all comfort goods sent to the front shall be handled by the logistics departments of the first-level military regions and field armies and their local offices by contacting the local railway general bureau, management bureau, branch bureau, and station for vehicle allocation. This transportation shall be given priority in vehicle allocation and transportation.
    Article 10 The rear transportation of military industry, military ordnance, military supplies, and health departments shall be planned uniformly by the logistics departments of each field army and each first-level military region and the Ministry of Railways, and each department must strictly implement the plan. The designated offices or agencies of the above departments may contact the local railway general bureau, management bureau, branch bureau, and station for vehicle allocation according to the plan. Except for weapons and ammunition, which may be given priority in vehicle allocation and transportation, other goods, raw materials, and machines shall be allocated and transported according to the military transportation consignment order number.
    Article 11 Temporary sporadic whole-car military transportation other than those in Articles 6, 7, 8, 9, and 10, even if not within the normal planned transportation, the railway bureau may still accept and handle the transportation. However, all military organs should strive for planned military transportation as much as possible to reduce sporadic transportation.
    Article 12 For the transportation in Articles 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11, the freight and miscellaneous fees shall be paid with military transportation checks. The military transportation checks shall be uniformly printed and issued by the Logistics Department of the Military Commission to the financial and economic offices in various regions for collection. The financial and economic offices in various regions shall allocate them to the logistics departments of the military regions and field armies on a regular basis according to the predetermined military transportation expenses, so as to pay the railway bureau's freight and miscellaneous fees before the military transportation vehicle is allocated. At the end of each month, the Ministry of Railways shall remit the military transportation checks to the Logistics Department of the Military Commission for review, and then submit them to the Central Financial and Economic Committee for appropriation according to the amount. The Central Financial and Economic Committee shall transfer the funds to various regions for settlement.
    Article 13 Railways shall differentiate all military transportation from general commercial transportation, establish a separate consignment order number, give priority to vehicle allocation, give priority to loading, and not charge express delivery surcharges.
  　Chapter IV Consignment and Acceptance Procedures
    Article 14 The military transportation referred to in Articles 6 and 7 of the previous chapter shall be issued by the Ministry of Railways of the Military Commission with a joint notice (or instructed by telegram to the general bureau and management bureau for handling); for the military transportation in Articles 8 and 9 of the previous chapter, the consigning organ or unit shall use a formal official letter, affixed with the official seal and the private seal of the responsible person, and deliver it to the railway general bureau, management bureau, or branch bureau, which shall issue a military transportation certificate. The consigning unit shall then use the certificate to pay the freight and miscellaneous fees (military transportation check) to the station for vehicle requisition. However, the station shall issue a military cargo ticket separately before loading and boarding. The military cargo ticket shall be divided into four copies. Copy A shall be stamped by the consigning unit and sent to the auditing section of the management bureau by the railway system together with the military transportation certificate as a supplementary basis for clearing freight with the Logistics Department of the Military Commission at the end of the month. Copy B shall be given to the using unit and sent to the department bearing the freight according to the military system as a reimbursement voucher. Copy C shall be used as a cargo ticket notice for the station and train to handle transportation procedures, and finally sent by the arrival station to the finance department auditing section of the bureau in charge for filing. Copy D shall be sent by the sending station to the military transportation section of the transportation department of the bureau in charge together with the consignment note for filing. In order to maintain the secrecy of military transportation, the station handling the military transportation certificate shall not retain any cargo ticket stub or military transportation certificate.
    Article 15 For the military transportation in Articles 10 and 11 of the previous chapter, the consigning unit shall fill in the military transportation consignment note and consign it directly to the stationmaster of each station. After receiving this military transportation consignment note, each stationmaster shall, in addition to receiving the consignment and collecting freight and miscellaneous fees (military transportation check) in accordance with the provisions of Article 13, also request vehicle allocation from the general bureau, management bureau, or branch bureau. All other procedures and cargo tickets used shall be the same as ordinary cargo transportation, including inspection of goods and identification of cargo grades.
  　Chapter V Calculation and Use of Military Transportation Freight
    Article 16 Each passenger car is defined as having 120 people, a passenger car converted from a covered wagon is defined as having 80 people, and a covered wagon is defined as having 60 people. Regardless of the actual number of passengers, whether it exceeds or falls short of the vehicle's defined number, the freight shall be calculated at half price according to the vehicle's defined number, which is the approved freight.
    The ambulance car shall also calculate freight according to the defined number of each car as specified above.
    Article 17 For military goods transported with a military transportation certificate or military cargo ticket, regardless of the grade of the goods, regardless of the actual weight (but the maximum weight shall not exceed 10% of the marked load of the freight car), each freight car used shall be calculated according to the marked load of the freight car. If the freight rate is divided into ten grades, it shall be calculated according to the freight rate of grade seven products (see Articles 6, 7, 8, and 9). If the freight rate is divided into five grades, it shall be calculated according to the freight rate of grade four products. The fractional part of the freight and miscellaneous fees shall be handled separately according to the passenger and freight transport rules.
    Article 18 For military goods transported with ordinary cargo tickets, all shall be graded, weighed, and charged according to the general current cargo transportation regulations (see Articles 10 and 11).
    Article 19 Except for weapons and ammunition sent directly to the front or sent back directly from the front, or supplied to the troops, they shall not be mixed with other military goods in one car. If they must be mixed, the military transportation certificate or military cargo ticket shall not apply, and all shall be calculated as ordinary goods, and shall not be calculated as weapons and ammunition.
    Article 20 The miscellaneous fees incurred in military transportation, such as shunting fees, late fees, loading and unloading fees, storage fees, and change fees, shall all be calculated according to the ordinary freight rates in the general cargo transportation regulations, and shall be paid in cash with military transportation checks. The handling of fractional miscellaneous fees and the minimum amount shall be collected in accordance with the general cargo regulations.
  　Chapter VI Transportation of Wounded
    Article 21 If the railway transports 10 freight cars or 5 passenger cars of wounded at one time from the same sending station to the same arrival station, and there is no suitable train to load and transport them at that time, a special train shall be opened for special transportation. However, such a special train shall not refuse the railway to add other vehicles. If the number of vehicles is less than the above, the railway shall use the most convenient train and give priority to loading and transporting them.
    Article 22 The train or special train with wounded cars added shall be changed to the current timetable operation, listed as the highest-level train, except for passenger trains or mixed trains, to reduce the pain of the wounded and allow them to be treated in the rear as early as possible.
    Article 23 Any wounded car shall be escorted by personnel responsible from the military health organ, and shall not be blamed on the railway. The railway may refuse to allocate vehicles to all those who do not send escorts or whose escorts do not report to the station.
    Article 24 The equipment and supplies of the wounded car shall be designed and prepared by the Ministry of Railways and the Logistics Department of the Military Commission, and the expenses shall be borne by the Logistics Department. The railway shall be responsible for safekeeping during peacetime. When in use, the conductor shall hand over the wounded car to the person in charge of the health organ escorting the wounded, and the escorting person in charge shall hand it over to the conductor at the arrival station. Both parties shall sign and seal in writing as evidence of the transfer. If there is any loss or damage, the responsibility for compensation shall be borne according to the circumstances of the transfer.
    Article 25 When using freight cars as substitute wounded cars to transport wounded in winter, the heating fuel is temporarily set at 2.5 kg of firewood and 30 kg of coal per 100 kilometers (including station stops). The fractional part less than 100 kilometers shall be converted proportionally, and the remainder less than 10 kilometers shall be rounded off.
    The fuel shall be prepared by the sending station, and the person in charge of the health organ escorting the wounded shall apply to the station for collection, be responsible for loading the car, and the collector shall sign and deliver it to the station. The summary shall be cleared at the end of each month, and the logistics departments of each first-level military region shall compensate the Ministry of Railways.
  　Chapter VII Measures for Military Personnel and Laborers to Take Trains
    Article 26 Unless otherwise specified, commanders and fighters in neat military uniform and holding formal passports of the unit may purchase half-price military tickets with their passports to ride in military cars. When railway personnel on the train or at the station check tickets, they shall present both the passport and the half-price ticket for inspection at the same time.
    If there are military cars on the train (such military half-ticket cars should be ordinary passenger cars and should not be replaced by freight cars), soldiers holding half-price tickets shall not sit with passengers. If they sit with passengers in passenger cars, they shall purchase full-price tickets like passengers to maintain order and discipline. If the military car is full, they shall comply with the designation of the railway responsible person and concentrate on riding in other passenger cars. When passengers are crowded, if there are empty seats in the military car, they shall be allowed to ride in the military car at the request of the conductor. If soldiers ride in passenger express trains, they shall also be charged half price.
    In order to reduce the fatigue of military and political organs above the regimental and county level who take long-distance night trains, a sleeping car is added to the passenger train (no mixed train), and cadres above the regimental and county level can buy sleeper tickets and enter the berth according to the number. When responsible cadres above the provincial governor and army commander use chartered cars, they shall pay cash at half price.
    Article 27 Military personnel in plain clothes, family members of military personnel, and party and government workers in military uniforms who are not in the military system shall not purchase half-price tickets. If they are found to be using them fraudulently, they shall make up the ticket according to the regulations.
    Article 28 New recruits with escorts and holding formal passports above the county level proving that they are indeed enlisted may obtain a ride certificate by submitting an official letter from the first-level military region to the railway general bureau, management bureau, or branch bureau and paying the fare (military transportation check) at a group half price before being allowed to ride the train.
    Article 29 Laborers who follow the troops or directly participate in the war and are sent back sporadically from the front shall hold a passport from an organ above the army level of the field army and a formal letter of introduction from the organ issuing the passport (the letter of introduction shall state the number of people and the sending and arrival stations) and may purchase half-price train tickets with the passport and letter of introduction before being allowed to ride the train.
  　Chapter VIII Special Designated Matters
    Article 30 The loading and unloading of military transportation goods shall be handled by the troops themselves in principle, but for less-than-carload military transportation goods handled in accordance with Article 32, or goods that the troops request the railway to load or unload, the railway may load or unload them after indicating them on the military transportation certificate or military transportation consignment note. When the railway loads or unloads vehicles as stipulated in the preceding paragraph, it shall collect cash loading or unloading fees as stipulated in the cargo transportation rules. The loading or unloading time for military transportation goods is stipulated as four hours. If the specified loading or unloading time is exceeded, the freight car late fee shall be collected in cash as stipulated in the cargo transportation rules. (Note: More specific regulations on the loading and unloading time of various goods and the progressive collection of late fees will be announced separately.)
    Article 31 All military transportation must be escorted by the consigning unit. For escorts of ammunition, weapons, valuables, and dangerous goods, the number shall not exceed five per car. For other military goods, the number shall not exceed three per car. For less-than-carload military goods, the number shall be one per batch.
    If the number of escorts exceeds the number specified in the preceding paragraph, the escort fee shall be collected as stipulated in the cargo regulations. The escort shall ride in the freight car being escorted.
    In addition, when less-than-carload military goods and ammunition are loaded in suitable vehicles, the escorts shall not leave the escorted goods.
    Article 32 Military transportation shall be based on whole cars and less-than-carload military transportation shall not be handled, but if the military transportation needs to carry goods that are less than one vehicle, the person in charge of the logistics command department above the army level shall send a letter to the railway bureau for transportation. After receiving the above letter, the railway bureau shall still accept and handle the transportation, and both parties may jointly discuss the allocation of other goods to avoid wasting transport capacity without hindering the guarding and safety of military goods.
    Article 33 Each organ using military transportation vehicles shall make a freight budget on a monthly basis and apply to its direct superior for checkbooks and a limited amount of freight funds. If any unit or troop issues bad checks or uses checks improperly, it shall be deducted from the unit's regular expenses and shall be prosecuted as illegal.
    Article 34 When the Logistics Department of the Military Commission issues military transportation checks, it shall agree on the method of use with the Railway Department of the Military Commission. If improper use of checks is found, it is an internal problem of the user, and the Railway Department of the Military Commission shall not be refused to cash the checks on schedule for any reason. If the user colludes with the railway bureau to commit fraud, the Logistics Department of the Military Commission and the Railway Department shall jointly be responsible for handling it.
    Article 35 All levels of military organs and railway organs shall strictly implement railway regulations and these regulations. Hereafter, if disputes arise between the two parties in military transportation, they shall not use unfamiliarity with railway regulations or these regulations as an excuse to shirk responsibility.
    Article 36 When loading and unloading military transportation goods, except for military ordnance, ammunition, and troops, the remaining military transportation railway bureau may send personnel to conduct spot checks. The spot check personnel shall wear a certificate issued by the ministry. With this certificate, they may conduct inspections, and each consigning unit shall not resist. If the spot check results show that the name, nature, quantity, etc. are inconsistent with the original cargo ticket record, they shall be handled as stipulated in the cargo transportation rules, and if the goods cannot be transported in one batch but are transported in one batch, they shall be handled in batches in accordance with the regulations.
    Article 37 For the loading and unloading of ammunition, the troops must handle the loading and unloading matters as stipulated in Article 9 of the regulations on the transportation of gunpowder stipulated by the Ministry of Railways of the Military Commission. (Before these regulations are issued and the gunpowder transportation regulations of each bureau are unified, they shall be handled in accordance with the regulations of each bureau.)
    Chapter IX Discipline
    Article 38 Discipline to be observed by railway personnel
    1. Railway personnel must enthusiastically handle military transportation, recognize that military transportation work is their own sacred duty, and explain the procedures of railway regulations and these regulations to the consigning troops in detail. Earnestly help solve the transportation difficulties of the troops, and shall not delay or make things difficult. Any problems that they themselves should or have the right to solve shall not be shirked to other departments or superiors, resulting in delays. In the event of an accident, railway personnel shall do their best to help the escort personnel protect and rescue.
    2. For military transportation consignors who have legal procedures, railway personnel shall not make them make extra complicated connections, and in particular, the procedures that the railway itself should handle shall not be entrusted to the consignor to handle on their behalf.
    3. Military transportation secrets must be kept confidential. No railway employee may disclose military transportation secrets, announce the direction of military transportation, or the content of military transportation.
    4. Wounded cars, weapons and ammunition cars, dangerous goods cars, and horse cars shall not be shunted or heavily loaded.
    Anyone who violates the above regulations shall be severely punished by the Ministry of Railways of the Military Commission depending on the severity of the circumstances, up to and including being handed over to the judicial organs for sentencing according to law.

　　中国人民革命军事委员会
  　铁路军运暂行条例
    （本条例定于四月十日起实行）
  　第一章　总则
    第一条　铁路为国家企业，又为人民解放战争机构的组成部分。本条例之目的在于既保证铁路军事运输之顺畅，又保证合理使用铁路运输而不浪费铁路运输力。
    第二条　军事运输为铁路的第一等任务。在军运计划上，铁道部无条件地执行中国人民革命军事委员会（以下简称军委会）之命令，保证军运之安全、迅速与便利。
    第三条　军事运输必须强调统一性与纪律性。各级部队必须严格遵守军委会铁道部奉令制定的总军运计划与铁路的既定规章和制度。各级部队必须保证在车辆使用上满员满装，快装快卸。除军委会批准的适应前方作战之军运及经各一级军区各野战军及其后勤部首长亲自审订的特殊紧急军运外，不得要求紧急军运或专车运送。
    第四条　人民铁路逐渐步入正轨。过去免费优待等办法即予废除。今后一切运输，包括军事运输在内，一律纳费。
  　第二章　军运定义
    第五条　军委会直属各机关、各野战军、各兵团司令部、各军、各军区、各军分区、各独立团以上之武装部队，以调防、补给、作战、军工、军需、军械、军医为目的之运输方为军运。至于部队以工农业生产或交换物资为目的所需之运输，地方党政机关所需之运输，县以下地方武装、市镇公安人员之调动及其物资供给品所需之运输，各种公营企业所需之运输，均不属军运范围。
  　第三章　军运办理上之区分
    第六条　依军委会及各野战军司令部之紧急调防作战计划所需大批（一次一列车以上）军事运输，由野战军或一级军区司令部向军委会铁道部直接提出，共同计划。此项运输计划，由司令部与铁道部分别按系统通知有关行政单位。各该行政单位收到通知书或电报后，即照计划向指定之铁路总局、管理局、分局、车站接洽办理；未收到共同通知书或共同电报之前，不得迳自交涉车辆，以免配车重复，贻误运输，或使运输计划不能实现。
    （注）车站接到铁路军运共同通知书或电报时，必须慎密保管之，俟持军运证人（请求输送部队及军用品者）到达后，即按章办理一切手续。
    第七条　凡属根据军委会各野战军各一级军区司令部之紧急调防作战计划直接大量补充前线之民工与物质供给品，如武器、弹药、粮秣、柴菜、被服、装具、交通、通讯、军医所用之器材与日用品，均由司令部与铁道部依第六条办法办理之。
    第八条　由前方向后方输送之伤员、民工、俘虏、以及缴获品，统由司令部驻在机关，或办事处，或指定之代理机关，向铁路总局、管理局、分局、车站交涉车辆，此项车辆应优先配给，优先挂运。

    第十八条　以普通货票运送之军货，统按一般现行货运规程之规定，分等、计重、计费（参看十、十一条）。
    第十九条　除迳送前方或迳由前方送回，或供给部队之武器弹药外，不得与其他军货混装一车，如必须混装时，不适用军运证或军运货票统按普通货物计算，不得按武器弹药计算。

  　第六章　伤员运送
    第二十一条　同一发站，同一到达站，铁路一次承运伤员达十个货车或五个客车，且当时适无适当列车挂运时，应特开专车专送之，但此项专车不应拒绝铁路加挂其他车辆，如少于上开辆数时，铁路需利用最捷便之列车，优先挂送之。
    第二十二条　加挂伤员车之列车或专车，除旅客列车或混合列车外，均须改为现时刻运转，列为最上级列车，以减少伤员之痛苦，俾得提早到后方治疗。
    第二十三条　任何伤员车，均应由军队卫生机关派人负责护送，不得诿责铁路。所有不派护送人员，或护送人员不向车站办理报到手续者，铁路得拒绝拨车。
    第二十四条　伤员车之装置及备品，由铁道部与军委会后勤部设计及筹备之，其费用由后勤部负担，平时由铁路负责保管，使用时由车长点交伤员车卫生机关护送负责人，到达到站再由该护送负责人点交车长。双方授受均以书面签章为凭，如有遗失损坏，按授受情形，分别负赔偿之责。
    第二十五条　使用货车代用之伤员车，在冬季输送伤员时，采暖燃料每百公里（停站时分在内）暂定为木柴二·五公斤，煤三十公斤，不足百公里之尾数，按比例折算，十公里以下之零数，四舍五入之。
