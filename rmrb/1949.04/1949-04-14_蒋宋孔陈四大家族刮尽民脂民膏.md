　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 12th. Wang Lihang, a Kuomintang pseudo-legislator, admitted in a written inquiry to the pseudo-Executive Yuan on the 8th of this month that the Kuomintang's minority financial oligarchs (referring to the bureaucratic capital group headed by the Chiang, Soong, Kung, and Chen families) are the culprits of treason, dictatorship, theft of the national treasury, exploitation of the people, and launching a counter-revolutionary civil war. Wang Lihang's inquiry stated: "Let's not beat around the bush. The current so-called national financial institutions, including the Four Banks (referring to the Central Bank, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Farmers Bank), the Two Bureaus (referring to the Central Trust Bureau and the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau), the One Treasury (referring to the Central Cooperative Treasury), and the One Committee (referring to the National Economic Commission), own 1,170 units, employ more than 24,000 people, and have assets all over the world, scavenging every penny. The state cannot control them, and the people cannot question them. Their items are not included in the national budget, and the financial authorities do not have their files; even if they do, they are unimportant waste paper. The accounting and auditing agencies have no records of them, and the examination and personnel agencies have no trace of them. Among the 177 directors and supervisors of the eight banks, bureaus, treasuries, and committees, only twenty people hold real power. In other words, the entire financial power of the country and the lifeline of all the people are determined by these twenty-odd people. They wave the banner of commercial shares, wear the cloak of the state, grab the government with their right hand, grab the people with their left hand, step on China with one foot, and are in foreign countries with the other, biting our compatriots and sucking our marrow; biting until corpses lie in the wilderness and blood flows like a river. May I ask Premier He and Minister of Finance Liu, have you seen the facts clearly in the face of this vast and tragic scene? What do you plan to do?" The inquiry wrote: "Please quickly add a clause to the policy to thoroughly reform the national financial institutions, so as to achieve the nationalization of banks, the unification of organizations, the socialization of business, and the democratization of supervision and command." But the logic of the facts is: only by destroying the anti-people's state organs controlled by the four major families, only by establishing a united government of people's democracy led by the proletariat and based on the worker-peasant alliance without the participation of reactionaries, can this government take over the power of the Nanjing Kuomintang reactionary government and its subordinate institutions at all levels, and can this government implement the nationalization of large enterprises and large banks, that is, confiscate bureaucratic capital and turn it into state-owned economy owned by the people, can the sinful rule of the four major families be eliminated.

　　蒋宋孔陈四大家族
  　刮尽民脂民膏
    【新华社北平十二日电】本月八日一国民党伪立法委员王力航在对伪行政院提出的书面质询中，承认国民党的少数金融寡头（按即以蒋、宋、孔、陈四大家族为首的官僚资本集团），乃是卖国、独裁、盗窃国库、剥削人民和发动反革命内战的罪魁。王力航的质询案称：“圈子不要兜了，现时所谓国家金融机构，包括四行（按指中央、中国、交通、农民四银行）两局（按指中央信托局及邮政储金汇业局）一库（按指中央合作金库）一会（按指全国经济委员会），拥有一、一七○个单位，职员二万四千余人，财产遍天下，搜刮尽锱铢。上之国不能管，下之民不能问，国家总预算上没有他们的科目，财政金融主管没有他们的案卷，纵有也是些无关重要的废纸；主计审计机关没有他们的记录，考试铨叙机关没有他们的影子。八个行局库会的理董监事一七七人的名额中，实权只操在二十人的手里。换言之，国家整个的财政金融大权和全体人民的命脉，只是这二十余人决定其命运。他们打着商股的旗帜，披着国家的外衣，右手抓住政府，左手抓住人民，一脚踏在中国，一脚乃在外国，咬紧我们的同胞，吸吮我们的膏血；咬得尸横四野，咬得血流成河。请问何院长、刘财长，面对这广大悲惨的场面，看清楚了事实么？打算怎样办呢？”该质询案写道：“请在施政方针里快快地加上一条，要彻底改革国家金融机构，做到银行国家化，组织统一化，业务社会化，监督指挥民主化。”但事实的逻辑却是：只有摧毁四大家族所控制的反人民的国家机构，只有成立没有反动分子参加的、无产阶级领导的、工农联盟为主体的人民民主的联合政府，由这个政府接收南京国民党反动政府及其所属各级机构的权力，并由这个政府实行大企业、大银行的国家化，亦即没收官僚资本，使之变为人民所有的国营经济，才能消灭四大家族的罪恶统治。
