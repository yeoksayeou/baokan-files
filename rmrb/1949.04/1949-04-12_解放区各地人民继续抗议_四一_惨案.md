    [This Newspaper's News] According to Xinhua News Agency: People's masses in various regions continue to protest the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary clique's massacre of Nanjing students. The Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Youth Federation, the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Student Federation, and the Yan'an University Student Union jointly issued a circular telegram on the 6th, expressing sincere condolences to all students in Nanjing's colleges and universities. The Northeast Student Federation also sent a telegram to the whole country on the 6th, protesting the "April 1st" Massacre and expressing support for the students in Nanjing. The telegram stated: "We students in the Northeast have never forgotten our fellow students in the Kuomintang-controlled areas who are under the oppression and massacre of the Kuomintang reactionaries. We will study hard and actively support the People's Liberation War, using our practical actions to support the students in Nanjing, resolutely support Chairman Mao's eight peace proposals, so that the liberation of the people in Jiangnan can be realized as soon as possible, and the vast number of students in Jiangnan can quickly gain freedom." One hundred and fifty representatives from eleven colleges and universities and ten secondary schools in Shenyang City gathered on the afternoon of the 8th to support the great struggle of Nanjing students for genuine peace. The Heilongjiang Student Federation also recently sent a telegram to support the heroic struggle of Nanjing students. The Jinan Student Federation, representing more than 20,000 students from universities and secondary schools throughout the city, sent a telegram on the 9th protesting the "April 1st" bloodbath, stating: This bloodbath nakedly shows that the Kuomintang reactionaries are waving the banner of "peace" in one hand and holding a butcher knife in the other. We will work together with students across the country to resolutely fight for the realization of the eight peace conditions put forward by Chairman Mao Zedong. The Preparatory Committee of the Central Plains Federation of Trade Unions also sent a telegram to students across the country on the 6th, expressing support and condolences to the patriotic students in Nanjing, calling on all workers in the Central Plains to urgently mobilize and support the People's Liberation Army's southward advance, so as to resolutely realize Chairman Mao's eight peace conditions and achieve genuine peace.
