　　【Jinan News】In order to vigorously develop afforestation, the En County Construction Section will establish a "Forest Company" and solicit public and private joint management through shareholding. The county has an old Shahe River, about sixty li long. Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, trees were widely planted on the riverbanks. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, due to lack of management, many trees were destroyed, causing crops on both sides of the river to suffer greatly from wind disasters, resulting in significant losses for farmers. To address this, the county government has decided to establish a "Forest Company" under the responsibility of the Construction Section to develop forestry along the Shahe River and green this sixty-li Shahe River. The company will have a manager, deputy manager, technician, accountant, and correspondent, each one; the entire length of the Shahe River will be divided into twelve sections, each with a section chief and deputy section chief; each village will have a shareholder representative; villages with fewer than ten shares will be merged into nearby villages. The shareholding methods are temporarily set as follows: 1. The total capital is 390,000 jin of millet. The government will hold two-thirds of the shares, and the people on both sides of the river will freely hold one-third of the shares. Dividends will be calculated according to the number of shares. 2. Each share is 10 jin of millet, and there is no limit to the number of shares that can be purchased. 3. Construction assistants in each district will be the directors of shareholding recruitment committees in their respective districts; village chiefs will be the shareholding committee members. 4. Tree seedlings can be used as shares: ten poplar seedlings with a height of four feet, or twenty seedlings with a height of three feet, will be counted as one share; forty jin of green poplar or willow branches will be counted as one share. 5. Labor can be used as shares: those who work planting trees will have every three workdays counted as one share.
