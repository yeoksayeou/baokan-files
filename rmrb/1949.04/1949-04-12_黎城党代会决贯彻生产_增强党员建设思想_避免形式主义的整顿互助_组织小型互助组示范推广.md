[Our Newspaper] Taihang Licheng County has completely finished the land reform work. In order to mobilize all party members to take active action and shift to the great production movement, the county party committee specially convened a county-wide party congress on March 18 to discuss the issue of ensuring the realization of this year's agricultural great production plan. The attending representatives, through discussion of the superior party committee's situation report, first recognized the new tasks brought about by the new situation and enhanced the construction thinking of actively building a new democratic society. The representatives examined various confused ideas about the new situation and new tasks: some believed that arranging production once a year was just the same old thing; some felt that production didn't need leadership anymore; others thought that democratic party consolidation work was tense, and that shifting to production could provide a rest. The ideological consciousness of building a new society was inspired from the criticism of the above confused ideas. For example, the representative of Yuancun in the first district said: "In the past, I thought leading production was a side job. After a few days of discussion, I realized that the army's victory and the implementation of land reform were all for production and construction. This meeting is just laying the foundation, and then we should build a good house!"

The representatives analyzed and studied the basic situation in rural areas after the land reform: After the land reform, the production enthusiasm of the vast number of farmers greatly improved. On the other hand, the following situations still existed relatively commonly: those who worked hard ate well, were active in production but not thrifty, and thought "it's okay to get by," and gloried in poverty. The above situation was mainly caused by the farmers' unclear understanding of the direction of rural economic development after the land reform. Therefore, it is necessary to widely and deeply publicize various policies to inspire the production enthusiasm of the broad masses. In addition, it is necessary to focus on developing rural supply and marketing cooperatives and doing a good job in production mutual aid work. Licheng's agricultural production mutual aid had achievements in the past, but some villages had great blindness when organizing mutual aid, regardless of the actual effect, but formalistically pursuing numbers; one-sidedly emphasizing mutual aid at all times and in all matters, which restricted the masses' production activities; forming groups involuntarily in order to take care of the widowed and lonely or to create experience; verbally claiming voluntariness but not allowing non-participation in mutual aid. Based on this, they then discussed how to earnestly implement the true voluntary and mutually beneficial mutual aid policy, organizing when production needs it, and disbanding when it is not needed, clarifying that rectifying mutual aid is an important key to whether the task of increasing production can be realized. The congress pointed out that party members (including district and village cadres) should set an example and, in accordance with different situations, truly voluntarily form small mutual aid groups that are conducive to production, set typical examples, and gradually promote them, overcoming the old formalistic methods of rectifying mutual aid. The congress demanded that all party members should overcome incorrect views such as belittling and exploiting women, earnestly do a good job in women's work, and mobilize half of the female labor force to invest in field labor. At the same time, seize the season, earnestly solve all practical problems related to increasing production, such as deep plowing and careful cultivation, repairing land and accumulating fertilizer, improving technology, promoting improved varieties, transporting firewood and coal, and, where possible, building canals to improve the conditions for increasing production. The congress clearly pointed out that before sowing, farmers should be organized to actively carry out more plowing, more weeding, and topdressing, increasing fertilizer by five loads per mu on the existing basis, averaging 30 to 40 loads of fertilizer. This is the only way to ensure the completion of the annual production increase plan. The congress called on all party members to take active action and carry out party building work in the great production movement, and to consolidate the achievements of party consolidation in the rural branches that have completed party consolidation.

  　增强党员建设思想
    避免形式主义的整顿互助
  　组织小型互助组示范推广
    【本报讯】太行黎城县已全部完成结束土改工作。为动员全体党员积极行动起来，转向大生产运动，该县委特于三月十八日召开了全县党代会议，讨论了保证今年农业大生产计划的实现问题。到会代表从讨论上级党委的形势报告中，首先认清新形势带来的新任务，增强积极建设新民主主义社会的建设思想。代表们检查了对新形势新任务的种种糊涂观念：有的认为一年一次布置生产，还不是那一套啊；有的则感到生产用不着领导啦；有的则是：民主整党工作很紧张，转上生产可以歇歇啦。从批评以上糊涂观念中启发了建设新社会的思想自觉。如一区元村代表说：“过去我觉得领导生产是捎搭，几天的讨论，我才知道，军队打胜仗，实行土地改革，都是为了生产建设，这会才是铺平地基，以后才该好好盖房子哩！”
    代表们分析与研究了土改结束后农村中的基本情况：土改结束后，广大农民的生产情绪大为提高了，另方面还相当普遍的存在这样几种情况：手里勤吃得好，生产积极但不节约，思想上是“能过就行”，以穷为荣。以上情况主要是由于农民对土改后农村经济的发展方向了解不明确而产生的。因之必须广泛深入的宣传各种政策，启发广大群众的生产热情。另外，必须有重点的发展农村供销合作社与搞好生产互助工作。黎城的农业生产互助，过去是有成绩的，但部份村庄组织互助时有很大的盲目性，不管实际效果，而是形式主义的追求数目字；片面强调时时互助、事事互助，而限制了群众的生产活动；为照顾孤寡或为创造经验，不自愿的组成小组；口讲自愿但不允许不参加互助。据此接着讨论了如何切实执行真正的自愿两利，生产需要则组织，不需要则解散的互助政策，明确整顿互助是能否实现增产任务的重要关键。大会指出，党员（包括区村干部）应以身作则的切实按照不同情况，真正自愿的组成有利于生产的小型互助，典型模范，逐步推广，克服老一套形式主义的整顿互助的办法。大会要求全体党员应克服对妇女的轻视、利用等不正确观点，认真做好妇女工作，发动妇女劳动力的半数，投入田间劳动。并抓紧季节，切实解决有关增产的一切实际问题，如深耕细作、修地积肥、提高技术、推广优良品种、打柴运煤，以及在可能条件下，修建水渠等，以改善增产条件。大会明确指出在下种以前，应组织农民积极进行多耕多锄上追肥，每亩地在现有基础上增加肥料五驮，平均上肥三十＠至四十驮，这对全年增产计划的完成，才有切实的保证。大会号召全体党员积极行动起来并在大生产运动中进行建党工作，已完成整党的农村支部巩固整党成果。（力文）
