　　Malayan People's Guerrilla Force—In January 1942, the Japanese invaders entered Malaya. In February, British Major General Percival, who was stationed in Singapore, signed the surrender to the Japanese invaders. The people of Malaya and the overseas Chinese, unwilling to be slaves of the Japanese invaders, formed the People's Anti-Japanese Army under the leadership of the Malayan Communist Party and persisted in the anti-Japanese struggle in Malaya. After Japan surrendered, British imperialism returned to Malaya, tearing up its promise to grant Malaya autonomous rights, using a hypocritical "federal plan" to dismember Malaya, and demanding the confiscation of the Anti-Japanese Army's weapons. At that time, they arrested the Anti-Japanese Army leader Wang Jinguang (transliteration) and more than 2,000 other democrats, and declared the Malayan Communist Party illegal... This series of reactionary measures made the Malayan people see the true face of British imperialism. Under the new call of the Malayan Communist Party, they reorganized the Malayan People's Anti-British Guerrilla Force (in July of last year, British official reports stated that the guerrilla force had four to five thousand people) and launched an armed independence and liberation movement. Since June last year (1948), Britain has concentrated almost its entire Pacific Fleet in Singapore, transported the British "elite troops" - the Scottish Guards Brigade and the 4th Light Cavalry Regiment - from England, transported the "Gurkha" (name of an Indian ethnic group) troops from India, and transported the cannibalistic savage "Dayak" troops from Borneo, totaling 50,000 troops, and equipped with large squadrons of aircraft, they hunted and killed people everywhere and burned villages. But Britain's brutal massacre cannot eliminate the armed forces of the Malayan people. On the contrary, it has aroused the more determined resistance of the Malayan people. In August, Britain itself announced that the "first stage of military offensive" had failed. The Malayan Communist Party, with 16,000 members, and the Malayan People's Guerrilla Force, with five independent detachments, after three years and eight months of anti-Japanese struggle and more than three years of the independence and liberation movement, the Malayan people are bound to win independence and liberation.

    马来亚人民游击队—一九四二年一月，日寇侵入马来亚，二月驻守新加坡的英国少将柏思华向日寇签字投降。马来亚人民和华侨，因为不甘做日寇的奴隶，在马来亚共产党领导下组成了人民抗日军，坚持了马来亚的抗日斗争。日本投降后，英国帝国主义回到了马来亚，撕毁了给马来亚以自治权利的诺言，以虚伪的“联邦计划”来肢解马来亚，并且要收缴抗日军武器，当时逮捕了抗日军领袖王锦光（译音）及其他民主人士二千多，宣布马来亚共产党为非法，……。这一连串的反动措施，使马来亚人民看清了英帝的真面目，他们在马共的新号召下，重新组成了马来亚人民抗英游击队（去年七月英国官方报导游击队有四五千人），展开了武装的独立解放运动。去年（一九四八）六月起，英国在新加坡几乎集中了整个太平洋舰队，从英伦运来了英国的“精锐部队”——苏格兰警卫旅和第四轻骑队，从印度运来了“廓尔喀”（印度一个民族名称）部队，从婆罗洲运来了吃人的野人“达雅克”部队，总计有五万兵力，并配备了大队的飞机，到处捕杀人民，烧毁村庄。但是英国的残酷屠杀消灭不了马来亚人民的武装，相反的，激起了马来亚人民更坚决的反抗，八月间，英国自己宣布“第一阶段的军事进攻”是失败了。拥有一万六千党员的马来亚共产党，拥有五个独立队的马来亚人民游击队，经过三年又八个月抗日斗争和三年多独立解放运动的马来亚人民，是一定会获得独立解放的。
