Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, April 17th: Students from ten universities and colleges in Nanjing formed the "Nanjing Area University and College April 1st Bloodshed Aftermath Handling Committee" after the Nanjing April 1st Massacre. They conducted a strike to protest and issued an open letter to compatriots across the country. This letter was mimeographed, and we only recently received the original text, which is now transcribed as follows:

Dear elders, brothers, sisters, and fellow countrymen!

Now, we, all the students in Nanjing, with the deepest sorrow, cry out to you about a bloody crime of government military officers, a planned and large-scale massacre of students!

The facts are as follows: Due to the continuous soaring prices, our public funding cannot fill our stomachs. Students without public funding cannot survive, and professors cannot escape hunger. Therefore, we hope the government will solve our survival difficulties. The government announced the release of political prisoners more than two months ago, and big and small traitors have already been released, but our students are still locked in iron cages. Therefore, we demand that the government release our arrested students. At the same time, we hope that true peace can be achieved. So, on April 1st, the day the government representatives set off for Beiping to begin peace talks, in order to express our wishes, we, the students from ten universities and colleges in Nanjing, held a petition for "struggling for survival" and "struggling for true peace." Who knew that the tragedy would happen on the way back to their respective schools after the petition was over!

At 2:30 pm that day, after the students from various schools dispersed at the Jinling University playground, more than 60 students from the National Academy of Dramatic Arts returned to school in a truck. When passing the National Defense Ministry's Officer Reception Corps on Daguang Road, more than 1,000 officers from the corps, armed with newly made wooden sticks about four feet long, were waiting in battle formation. When the truck arrived, they stopped it, shouted to attack, immediately smashed the glass, dragged the students off the truck, tied them with ropes, and beat them brutally. The students from the Academy of Dramatic Arts were beaten until they were seriously injured and collapsed on the side of the road. The nearby people shouted, "Too tragic! Too tragic!" At this time, more than 100 students from the National Chengchi University rushed to the scene, hoping that the officers' violence could be dissuaded, but as soon as the truck arrived, the officers immediately smashed the truck and dragged the students to beat them. More than 50 students from Chengchi University were injured in the attack. Upon hearing this news, students from National Central University and Jianguo College of Law and Commerce had no choice but to go to the Presidential Palace to petition, asking the government to order a stop to this violence. Who knew that after arriving at the Presidential Palace, more than 50 policemen arrived, followed by the officers of the National Defense Ministry's Reception Corps, who arrived from Daguang Road in large trucks, each carrying wooden sticks and stones. After getting off the trucks, they immediately launched a fierce attack on our unarmed students. At this time, the students fled in panic, and shouts rose everywhere. The Presidential Palace not only did not allow us to enter for refuge and protection but instead closed the iron gates and allowed the officers of the National Defense Ministry's Reception Corps to brutally beat more than 100 students locked inside the iron gates. The police also whipped the students with belts. As a result, dozens more students were seriously injured. So far, more than 200 injured students have been counted, and more than 70 of them are seriously injured and sleeping in the hospital. Cheng Luyi, a student from Zhongda, has died due to serious injuries, and Chen Lisan, a driver from Chengchi University, has also died. In addition, there are ten seriously injured students whose lives are in danger. The whereabouts of 35 students are still unknown. That night, the officers of the reception team robbed the Academy of Dramatic Arts three times, looting all the savings of teachers and students.

Dear elders, brothers, sisters, and fellow countrymen! The government military officers' large-scale massacre of our young students is a completely planned and vicious conspiracy. More than 1,000 government military officers, all carrying newly made wooden sticks, had arranged a killing formation in advance, tying up students and subjecting them to collective beatings and massacres. The so-called officers of the reception team are, in fact, armed secret agents conspiring and instigating by reactionaries.

We are forced by survival to ask the government to solve our difficulties, and we ask for the release of our arrested students. Are these unreasonable demands? We demand the realization of true peace. Is this unreasonable? Is our reasonable petition for survival and true peace worth the government military officers using wooden sticks and stones to carry out inhumane massacres against us?

The cruel civil war has been fought for more than three years, making the people miserable! Which of the people across the country does not hope for the realization of true peace? Acting President Li has also announced seven promises to release political prisoners, abolish martial law, and guarantee the people's personal freedom. Our reasonable petition for survival and true peace is carried out with the aim of hoping for the realization of true peace and the implementation of Acting President Li's seven promises, but our experience is so tragic!

The government has been talking about peace for more than three months, and now it has sent representatives to Beiping for peace talks, but on the first day of the peace talks, the capital Nanjing witnessed a planned and large-scale massacre of students by government military officers. The government's peace talk representatives went to talk peace, while the government military officers collectively killed people in the back. We really don't know how the government's sincerity for peace can be proven? Is there really such a strange thing in the world as talking about peace while killing people?

We hate the bloody crimes of the reactionaries' large-scale planned massacre of young students! We mourn the martyred students who have died! We are anxious for the injured and missing students who are groaning in pain! Dear elders, brothers, sisters, and fellow countrymen, we hope you will extend your hands to rescue us!

We are determined to avenge the dead, demand a thorough investigation of the masterminds of this bloodshed, demand punishment for the masterminds and murderers! Demand the return of the missing students! Demand that the authorities compensate for all losses, including medical expenses, funeral expenses, bereavement compensation, and items that were broken or robbed! Demand the protection of students' lives, personal freedom, and school stability! And we will continue to fight for survival! Fight for true peace!

Dear elders, brothers, sisters, and fellow countrymen: Please see clearly this bloody and tragic fact! Please rescue us! Help us! Finally, for the sake of the people across the country to live on, let us join hands to strive for the survival of the people across the country! Strive for the true peace that the people want!

Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, April 18th: According to Hangzhou news: Students from various universities and colleges in Hangzhou have launched activities to protest the Kuomintang reactionaries' massacre of Nanjing students in the "April 1st" tragedy. They had decided to hold a collective parade and demonstration on the 14th, but the Zhejiang Provincial Puppet Security Command dispatched a large number of military police and secret agents to suppress them, causing the parade and demonstration to fail to take place as scheduled. According to Shanghai news: In view of the fact that the Nanjing Academy of Dramatic Arts was destroyed and robbed by Kuomintang military police and secret agents on April 1st, students from various universities in Shanghai have established emergency response organizations to prevent Kuomintang bandit troops and secret agents from destroying schools, killing and robbing students before the arrival of the People's Liberation Army. They are ready to "cope with emergency situations" at any time through school protection movements. Students at Jiaotong University took the lead in forming an "Emergency Response Team," with various agencies set up to undertake fire fighting, rescue, surveillance, patrol, and other tasks. More than 1,000 students at Fudan University practiced digging trenches and rescue operations on campus. In order to participate in the preparatory work for dealing with emergencies, students at National Tongji Medical College have suspended classes for two days. In other universities and middle schools, the emergency response school protection movement is also developing rapidly. Such self-defense actions by unarmed students are also prohibited by Chiang Kai-shek's diehards. Chen Daqing, the Shanghai Puppet Garrison Commander, ordered the authorities of various schools on the 17th to disband student school protection organizations such as "School Protection Teams" and "Emergency Situation Committees," and threatened to send bandit troops to station in the schools.

### 中大等十院校学生　控诉南京惨案罪行

　　中大等十院校学生
  　控诉南京惨案罪行
    【新华社北平十七日电】南京十个专科以上学校的学生，在四月一日南京惨案发生后，曾组成“南京区大专学校四一血案善后处理会”，进行罢课抗议，并发出告全国同胞书。该书系油印，本社最近才收到原文，现转录如下：亲爱的父老兄弟姊妹们！
    现在我们全南京的学生，怀着十二万分沉痛的心情，向您哭诉一桩政府军官有计划地大规模屠杀学生的血腥的罪行！
    事实的经过是这样的：由于物价的不断飞涨，我们的公费填不饱肚子，没有公费的同学，更是无法生存，教授们也不能免于饥饿，因此我们希望政府为我们解决生存的困难。政府宣布释放政治犯已经有两个多月，大小汉奸都已经释放了，而我们的同学仍然被关在铁牢里，因此我们要求政府释放我们被捕的同学。同时我们更希望真正的和平能够实现。所以在四月一日政府代表启程北飞开始进行和谈的一天，为了表达我们的愿望，我们全南京十个专科以上学校的学生举行了“争生存”，“争真和平”的请愿。谁知在我们请愿完毕，各校同学分别返校的途中惨案便发生了！
    那天下午二点半钟。各校同学在金陵大学操场解散后，国立戏剧专科学校同学六十余人乘卡车一辆回到学校去。路过大光路国防部收容军官总队时，便早有该队军官一千多人，手持新制的长约四尺的木棍，在那里严阵以待。当车子开到时，他们把车拦住，一声喊打，立刻将玻璃捣碎，将车上同学拖下，用绳索捆绑，施以毒打。剧专的同学被打得一个个伤重倒地，丢在路旁。附近老百姓看了都连叫“太惨了！太惨了！”这时政治大学同学一百多人闻讯赶到，希望军官们这种暴行能被劝阻，但是车刚开到，不由分说，军官们立刻将卡车捣毁，拖住同学便打；政大同学经此围殴，又受伤五十余人。中央大学和建国法商学院的同学听到这个消息，在无可奈何之下，只有到总统府去请愿，请政府下令制止这种暴行。谁知在到达总统府之后，就来了五十多名警察，接着国防部收容总队的军官就从大光路乘大卡车赶到，人人手执木棍石块，下车之后立即向我们徒手的学生凶猛进攻。这时同学们都纷纷逃命，喊声四起，总统府不但不让我们进内避难，加以保护，反而把铁门拉上，并且将关在铁门内的同学一百余人任国防部收容军官毒打，警察也用皮带抽打同学。这样，同学又有数十人受重伤。到目前为止，受伤的同学经统计出来的已有二百多人，其中伤势沉重睡在医院里的有七十多人，中大同学程履绎已因伤重身死，政大司机陈礼三亦身死。其余尚有十个重伤同学，生命危在旦夕。有三十五个同学至今下落不明。那天深夜收容队军官并三次向剧专校进行抢劫，将教职员学生仅有的积蓄洗劫一空。
    亲爱的父老兄弟姊妹们！政府军官这样大规模屠杀我们青年学生的罪行，完全是有计划的狠毒的阴谋行动。他们一千多政府军官，一律手持新制的木棍，事先就布置好了杀人的阵势，将学生捆绑，施以集体的毒打和屠杀。所谓收容总队的军官，事实上就是反动派阴谋策动的武装特务。
    我们由于生存所迫，要求政府给我们解决困难，我们要求释放我们被捕的同学，难道都是不应该的吗？我们要求真和平的实现，难道又是不应该的吗？难道我们要求生存、要求真和平的合理的请愿，就值得政府军官用木棍石块向我们进用惨无人道的屠杀吗？
    残酷的内战打了三年多，打得人民好惨！全国人民哪一个不希望真正的和平实现？李代总统也曾宣布过七项诺言，要释放政治犯，要取销戒严令，要保障人民身体的自由。我们争生存，争真和平的合理请愿，便是在希望真和平实现和李代总统七项诺言实施的目的之下进行的，但是我们的遭遇，却是这样的悲惨！
    政府讲和平已经讲了三月多，现在更已派出代表到北平去进行和谈，但是就在和谈开始的头一天，首都南京就发生了政府军官有计划地大规模屠杀学生的血案；政府和谈代表前去讲和，政府军官在后面集体杀人，我们真不知道政府和平的诚意究竟如何可以证实？世界上难道有一面杀人一面讲和平的奇事吗？
    我们痛恨反动派大规模有计划屠杀青年学生的血腥的罪行！我们为已死的殉难的同学悲伤！我们为辗转呻吟的受伤同学和失踪的同学焦急！亲爱的父老兄弟姊妹们，愿您们伸出营救我们的手！
    我们决心为死者复仇，要求彻底查出这次血案的主谋者，要求惩办主谋者和杀人的凶手！要求交出失踪的同学！要求当局赔偿一切损失，包括医药费、治丧费、遗族抚血费以及被打坏被抢劫的什物！要求保障同学的生命安全，身体自由和学校安定！并且我们要继续争生存！争真和平！
    亲爱的父老兄弟姊妹们：请您看清楚这一次血腥惨痛的事实！请您营救我们！援助我们！最后，为了全国人民要活下去，让我们共同携手，争取全国人民的生存！争取人民所要的真正的和平！

    【新华社北平十八日电】据杭州消息：杭州各大学和专科学校的学生，为了抗议国民党反动派屠杀南京学生的“四一”惨案，已展开活动，并曾决定于十四日集体游行示威，浙江省伪保安司令部竟出动大批军警特务镇压，致游行示威未能按期举行。另据上海消息：上海各大学学生鉴于南京剧专四月一日曾遭国民党军警特务破坏抢劫，为了防止国民党匪军特务在解放军到达前破坏学校，杀害及抢劫学生起见，纷纷成立应变组织，随时“准备应付紧急情况”的护校运动。交通大学学生首先组成“应变团”，分设各种机构，准备担任救火、救护、监视、巡逻等项工作。复旦大学千余名学生在校内实习挖战壕及救护动作。国立同济医学院学生为了参加应付紧急事变的准备工作，已停课两天。在其他大学和中学内，应变护校运动，也正在迅速发展。赤手空拳的学生们的这种自卫举动，亦为蒋介石死党所禁止。上海伪警备司令陈匪大庆已于十七日命令各校当局解散“学校防护团”，“应付紧急情况委员会”等学生护校组织，并且威胁说：他准备派遣匪军进驻学校。
