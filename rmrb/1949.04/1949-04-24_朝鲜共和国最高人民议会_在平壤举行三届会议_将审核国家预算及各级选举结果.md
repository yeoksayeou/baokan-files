Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 23rd -- TASS, Pyongyang: The third session of the Supreme People's Assembly of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea convened in Pyongyang on April 19th. Five hundred representatives were present, including 227 representatives from South Korea. After an opening address by He Xianzhi, Chairman of the Supreme People's Assembly, the assembly unanimously adopted the following agenda: to examine the 1949 national budget and the 1948 budget implementation report; the results of the visit of the delegation of the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to the Soviet Union; and the results of the elections of the provincial, municipal, and county committees in the northern part of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

Minister of Finance Cui Guoyi reported on the implementation of the 1948 budget and the draft budget for the northern part of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in 1949. He said: At present, South Korea is occupied by the U.S. military against the will of the Korean people. Therefore, it is impossible to draft a unified national budget for the entire Democratic People's Republic of Korea, and only the budget for the northern part of the republic can be submitted to the assembly for review. He pointed out that the 1948 national budget showed a surplus of 1,097,300,700 won compared to revenue and expenditure. The budget revenue stipulated a reduction in taxes and an increase in revenue from the national economy. The main expenditures in 1948 were used for national economic sectors such as industry, agriculture, state-owned trade, local industry, and transportation, as well as social and cultural needs. He also stated that the 1949 draft budget submitted to the assembly must guarantee the successful completion of the two-year plan for the restoration of the national economy. The budget revenue for the northern part of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea is set at 19.07 billion won, and the budget expenditure is set at 19 billion won.

    将审核国家预算及各级选举结果
    【新华社北平二十三日电】塔斯社平壤讯：朝鲜人民民主共和国最高人民议会第三届会议于四月十九日在平壤开会，到有代表五百名，其中包括南朝鲜代表二百二十七名。在最高人民议会主席许宪致开会词后，大会一致通过议程如下：审核一九四九年度国家预算及一九四八年度预算执行报告；朝鲜人民民主共和国政府代表团访苏成果；朝鲜人民民主共和国北部省、市、县委员会选举结果。
    财政部长崔呙益报告一九四八年度预算执行情形及朝鲜人民民主共和国北部一九四九年度预算草案。他说：目前朝鲜南部是被美军违反朝鲜人民意志而占领着；因此，草拟全朝鲜人民民主共和国统一的国家预算是不可能的，只能提出共和国北部的预算交付大会审核。他指出：一九四八年度国家预算中岁入与岁出相比，计盈余十亿九千七百三十万七千元。预算岁入项中规定减少税收，增加国家经济方面的收入。一九四八年度主要岁出曾用在工业、农业、国营贸易、地方工业、运输业等国民经济部门以及社会文化需要方面。他又称：提交议会的一九四九年预算草案必须保证国民经济两年复兴计划的胜利完成。朝鲜人民民主共和国北部预算岁入定为一百九十亿七千万元，预算岁出定为一百九十亿元。
