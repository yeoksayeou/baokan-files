　　A Doctor's Transformation
　　Hu Xu
　　Dr. Liu used to be a top student at Peking Union Medical College. After graduating, he went to Germany and then returned to the school as the director of the school clinic. Although Dr. Liu studied medicine, no one ever saw him treat a patient. Later, it was learned that he studied medicine out of curiosity to see iron lung patients, but in the end, he chose pathology, specializing in reading books and writing papers. Dr. Liu was very careless. Last year, when the students marched into the city, he was afraid that someone would get hurt, so he organized a rescue team and specially invited him to explain first aid methods. He first said that it didn't seem like anything would happen today. After repeated requests from the students, he only talked about some very common medical knowledge. He also knew that this temper of his was not very good, but he forgave himself and it was over. Around December last year, after the People's Liberation Army attacked Dashiqiao outside Yuanmingyuan, fierce fighting took place there. The Kuomintang bandit army, unable to withstand the attack, retreated at night, and from then on, the western suburbs of Peiping were officially liberated. Dr. Liu chose a good day, carrying a cloth bag, and taking a few bottles of medicine, and walked towards Yuanmingyuan, hoping to obtain some good specimens. Dr. Liu was really tired that day. He didn't come back for lunch, and it was not until evening that he returned home excitedly. A few days later, on the windowsill on the right-hand side of Dr. Liu's desk, there were three or four glass bottles, soaking several thin, wrinkled broken hands in pale yellow liquid. Each bottle was labeled with a piece of paper, saying: "Injured by mortar shells," "Injured by hand grenades"... In his opinion, whether it was a just war or an anti-people war, that was all it was. Dr. Liu was in his forties or fifties, but he only had one child, who was only seven years old this year. Dr. Liu and his wife loved their child very much. One day, Dr. Liu was in a good mood and took his child on a bicycle ride to the road in the western suburbs. Just as he arrived at the entrance of the Summer Palace, Dr. Liu proudly rushed through the archway. Suddenly, a PLA truck came from the opposite side. A pedicab in front of Dr. Liu immediately braked, but Dr. Liu didn't notice the brake. The truck couldn't stop in time, and the front of the truck knocked down Dr. Liu's bicycle, and both the bicycle and the people fell down. The truck stopped immediately, and a PLA comrade opened the door and jumped down, busily asking, "Is the child hurt?" Dr. Liu got up, looked at the bloodstains on the child's wrist, and said, "It's okay, it's okay, just scratched the skin." The PLA comrade grabbed the child's arm and looked at it, saying seriously, "That won't do! The child's arm is sprained, take him to the hospital quickly." Saying that, he picked up the child and put him on the truck. Dr. Liu carried the bicycle onto the truck and followed. He thought about the extent of the child's injury, and also thought that his wife at home would complain about him, and he became even more flustered. After a while, the car stopped in front of a field hospital. The PLA comrade took the child in, and Dr. Liu followed in. After a while, that comrade came back and introduced himself to Dr. Liu as Yang Ming, a military doctor in this military hospital. Dr. Liu was in no mood to be polite to him, and asked anxiously, "How is the child?" Comrade Yang Ming said, "You rest for a while, the X-ray is being used inside, I'll go in and take a look for him right away." Dr. Liu walked back and forth in the waiting room, Comrade Yang Ming went in, and he started to think irrationally - he was worried whether the PLA would be like American cars in the past that ran over Chinese children, blaming him for blocking the truck's way? He was also worried that the PLA would run away, who would be responsible? Who would pay for this medical bill? He also thought, what exactly happened to the child's arm? ... In an instant, Comrade Yang Ming came in and said plainly, "It's okay, just a sprain in the wrist joint, no broken bones." Dr. Liu was relieved and wanted to go in and see with Yang Ming. Dr. Liu saw that the child's arm was in a cast, and his heart settled down. At this time, Yang Ming came over and apologized to Dr. Liu, and talked to him for a while. Dr. Liu thought about the issue of treatment costs, and hurriedly asked how much the medical expenses would be. Yang Ming shook his head and stated that it was his own mistake and he would pay for the medical expenses himself. Dr. Liu thanked him for a while, bid farewell to Comrade Yang Ming, and went home to report the news. On the way, he thought about how to deal with his wife. But as soon as he got home, his wife heard that the child was in the hospital, and she knew that something was wrong, and she cried out in fright. While crying, his wife argued with Dr. Liu for a while. She knew her husband's carefree temper and didn't believe what her husband said. She had to go and see the child. Dr. Liu knew that it was useless to persuade her, so he had to watch his wife leave. The room was too quiet, without a sound to disturb Dr. Liu. His thoughts began to move. He thought: Why was he so flustered when riding the bicycle? He replayed the scene of hitting the child and entering the ward in his mind. He took a deep puff of his cigarette and whispered to himself: "Oh, my child! Luckily, we met Comrade Yang Ming." At this time, the more he thought about it, the more confused he became. He wondered why the army could be so responsible when a car hit the common people, and why the PLA doctors could be so earnest in serving the patients. Why couldn't the doctors he had seen be like this, and why couldn't he be like this? ... He couldn't understand thousands of questions! ... He used his brain the most this day, and unknowingly, Dr. Liu fell asleep. On the day the child was discharged from the hospital, Dr. Liu found Comrade Yang Ming, partly to thank him for his kindness, and partly to bravely raise his questions: "I really admire your earnestness and enthusiasm, but I don't know what force drives you to do this?"
　　Yang: (Smiling) It's just having a firm people's standpoint and infinite enthusiasm for serving the people. For example, those wounded soldiers, they are dedicating their lives to the work of liberating the people. Their goals are the same as ours, and we doctors are just..."
　　Liu: (Interrupting Yang) I understand all these theories, I just don't understand why you do things so earnestly, and I am so careless when things happen?
　　Yang: (Thinking for a moment) This is because you haven't established a standpoint of serving the workers and peasants. The medical talents cultivated in the old society were all for the enjoyment of the ruling class. The ruling class often wants to extend their lifespan and maintain their health. When they have a cold or cough, they are afraid of pneumonia, and when their stomach hurts slightly, they are afraid of cholera, and you used to serve them.
　　Liu: Nodding.
　　Yang: The viewpoint of serving the working class and the masses must be established.
　　Liu: Is research work not important?
　　Yang: It is very important. But engaging in theory without linking it to the lives of the masses will become dogma, useless things.
　　Liu: Thought for a while and then said: I have decided to participate in practical work.
　　Yang: You can still continue to do research, because in a new society, people are also needed to engage in research work. As long as you stand on the people's standpoint and hold the viewpoint of serving the people, it is fine.
　　Liu: (Standing up) No, I still want to start with practical work. A few weeks later, the school's bulletin board said that Dr. Liu had left. Where did he go? It's not accurate to say, but someone saw that Dr. Liu had already put on a PLA uniform.

　　一个医生的转变
    胡  须
    刘大夫过去是协和医学院的高材生，毕业后去德国一趟，归国后又来学校当了校医室主任。刘大夫虽然是学医的，却从没有见到他诊过一次病。后来才知道他因为好奇要看看铁肺人才学医的，但结果他又选择学病理学，专门看看书，写论文。刘大夫很马虎，去年同学们进城游行时，怕有人受伤，组织一个救护队，并专请他来讲解急救法。他首先说看情形今天不会出事的。经同学们再三请求之后，他才讲了一点最普通的医学常识。他也知道自己这种脾气不太好，但自己原谅自己一下就过去了。去年十二月间，解放军进攻圆明园后的大石桥，在那里发生激战，国民党匪军不支就乘夜退却，从此平市西郊正式解放。刘大夫选了一个好天，提着一个布袋，带上几瓶药水，走向圆明园，希望能够获得几样好标本。刘大夫这天真辛苦了，午饭也没回来吃，到晚上才兴冲冲地回家。几天以后，在刘大夫办公桌右手的窗台上，摆着三四个玻璃瓶，淡黄色的药水里浸着几只瘦绉绉的断手，每个瓶上贴着张纸条子，文曰：“迫击炮弹炸伤”，“手榴弹炸伤”……在他看来，不管是正义战争，还是反人民战争就是这样一回事。刘大夫年纪有四五十岁了，可是他只有一个小孩子，今年才七岁，刘大夫和他太太非常疼爱他的孩子。有一天，刘大夫高兴起来，带着小孩骑上自行车想到西郊马路上去逛。刚到颐和园门口，刘大夫得意地冲过牌坊，突然对面一辆解放军大卡车开过来，在刘大夫前面的一辆三轮马上杀住，刘大夫却没注意杀车，卡车开过来一时收不住了，车头碰倒了刘大夫的车子，车与人都倒下来。卡车马上停下，一个解放军同志打开车门跳下来忙问道：“小孩伤了没有？”刘大夫爬起来，看看小孩手腕上有些血痕说道：“不要紧，不要紧，只是擦伤了块皮。”那位解放军同志拉着小孩的膀子看了看，严重地说：“不行呵！小孩的膀子挫了，快送到医院去。”说着把小孩抱上卡车，刘大夫把自行车搬上卡车随着走了。他想着小孩的受伤程度，也想到家里太太会埋怨自己，心里更慌乱了。一会儿，车子停在一个野战医院的门前，解放军同志把小孩抱进去，刘大夫也跟进去。一会那个同志走回来向刘大夫介绍自己叫羊明，是这个军医院的军医。刘大夫也没心和他客气，急问道：“小孩怎样了？”羊明同志道：“你休息会儿，里面Ｘ光有人正用着，马上我就进去替他照照看。”刘大夫在候诊室走来走去，羊明同志进去了，毫无理智地乱想起来—他担心解放军是否会象过去美国汽车辗死中国小孩那样，怪他拦住卡车的去路？他又担心这个解放军逃了，责任归谁担负？这一笔医药费归谁出？又想到，究竟孩子的膀子怎么样？……一瞬间，羊明同志走进来，平淡地说了声：“没事，只是腕骨关节挫开了，没有跌碎骨片”。刘大夫松下了心，要跟着羊明进去看看。刘大夫看见孩子的膀子上了石膏，心才安下来。这时羊明走过来向刘大夫赔了罪，又和他谈了一阵，刘大夫想起疗诊费的问题，连忙问得多少医药费。羊明摇了摇头，申明这个错误是自己犯的，医药费得自己出。刘大夫感谢了一阵，辞别了羊明同志，回家去报讯。在路上他想着如何应付太太。可是一到家，太太一听到小孩住在医院里，就知道大事不好，骇得哭啼起来，太太一面哭一面与刘大夫争吵一阵，她知道丈夫吊儿朗当的脾气，不相信丈夫的话，她非要去看看小孩子不可。刘大夫知道自己劝也没用，只好看着太太去了。屋子里太静了，没有一点声音打扰刘大夫，他的思索运动起来，他想：为什么自己骑车子那么慌乱？他把孩子又碰着，到进入病室的情景，都在脑子里放映了一遍。他深深地抽了口烟，低声地自言自语：“哦，我的孩子！幸亏遇到羊明同志”。这时，他越想越糊涂起来，他对军队汽车碰了老百姓能这样负责，对解放军的医生这样认真为病人服务，为什么自己见过的医生就不能这样，自己就不能这样……，千头万绪的问题都不理解呵！……这一天他用脑子最多了，在不知不觉中，刘大夫睡去了。小孩子出院的那一天，刘大夫找着羊明同志，一方面是感谢他的恩情，一方面勇敢的提出了他的疑问：“我真佩服你们作事认真、热心，但不知道什么力量推动你们去这样作？”
    羊：（笑了笑）只是有一个坚定的人民立场，与无限为人民服务的热情，譬如说那些受伤的战士，他们献出生命从事解放人民的工作。他们的目标和我们是一样的，咱们做医生的就是把……”
    刘：（拦住羊）这一套理论我都懂，只是不懂为什么你们作事那样认真，而我遇事那样马虎？
    羊：（想了想）这是因为你为工农服务的立场还没有树立的原故。在旧社会里面所培养出来的医学人材，都是为统治阶级享受用的，统治阶级常常想延续自己的寿命，保持自己的健康，有点伤风咳嗽时，他就怕是肺炎，肚子稍痛时，他就怕是霍乱，而过去你就为他们服务。
    刘：点点头。
    羊：替工农大众服务的观点必须建立起来。
    刘：研究工作不重要吗？
    羊：是很重要的。但空搞理论不与群众生活联系，就会变成教条，没有用的东西。
    刘：想了想接着说：我已决定去参加实际工作。
    羊：你现在还可以继续研究，因为在一个新的社会里，也需要人从事研究工作。只要你是站在人民的立场上，抱着为人民服务的观点就可以了。
    刘：（站起来）不，我还是要从实际干起来。几个礼拜后，在学校的布告上说刘大夫走了。什么地方去了呢？说不准确，不过有人看到刘大夫已经穿上了解放军服。
