　　【Tianjin, 3rd】 The Tianjin branch of Jibei Electric Power Company has recently established its fourth power plant, which began transmitting electricity on the 1st, initially sending about 1,000 kilowatts. The company's original three power plants had a maximum power generation capacity of 37,000 kilowatts. After liberation, although the power generation of each plant has reached its maximum limit, it still cannot meet the ever-increasing electricity demand. Therefore, at the beginning of last month, a contract was signed with the No. 7 Textile Factory of the China Textile Corporation (as the factory was damaged by the Chiang bandits during the Tianjin Liberation Campaign and could not be fully restored for a while) to use its site and power generation equipment to establish the fourth power plant. However, in order to adapt to the power supply situation, it must be modified. From the 10th to the 31st of last month, through the efforts of all employees for 20 days, it was successfully completed after seven test runs and several modifications. During the last test run, the power generation reached 2,800 kilowatts.

　　冀电天津分公司新建第四发电厂
    【天津三日电】冀北电力公司天津分公司新近建立第四发电厂，已于一日开始送电，第一次暂发一千千瓦左右。按该公司原有发电厂三处，最高发电量为三万七千千瓦。解放以后，各厂发电量虽已达到最高限度，但仍不能满足日益增加的电力需要，因此于上月初与中纺第七厂（按该厂曾于天津解放战役中，遭到蒋匪破坏，一时无法全面复工）订立合同，利用其厂址与发电设备筹组第四发电厂。但为适应供电情形，必须加以改装。从上月十日至三十一日经全体员工二十天努力，前后七次试车，数次更动，方告成功。末次试车时，发电量已达二千八百千瓦。
