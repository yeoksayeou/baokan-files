　　North Atlantic Treaty is a Law of Violence
  　Wall Street Financial Groups Admit it Themselves
    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 9th: TASS, New York - The Wall Street Journal, the mouthpiece of American monopoly capitalists, big speculators, and stock exchange brokers, blatantly admitted that the North Atlantic Treaty abandoned the principles of the United Nations. In its editorial on the 5th, commenting on the signing of the North Atlantic Treaty on the eve of the opening of the UN General Assembly, the newspaper stated: "The successive occurrence of these two events suggests that it was intentionally arranged to flaunt the law of violence prevailing over international cooperation on a global scale. Therefore, regardless of what is said, the North Atlantic Treaty does indeed abandon the principles of the United Nations. The initiators of the North Atlantic Treaty may object to calling it a law of violence, but even the most cursory analysis reveals that the civilized facade used to conceal it is very thin. This makes military force the decisive factor in international relations." However, the Wall Street Journal did not express regret that Washington replaced the principles of international cooperation and human reason with the law of violence and barbarous force. On the contrary, the newspaper claimed: "We do not regret these things, and we do not believe the assertion that the North Atlantic Treaty should not exist because it negates the principles of the United Nations. We believe that the law of violence of the North Atlantic Treaty is more practical than the ideal human principles of the United Nations."

　　北大西洋公约是暴力法则
  　华尔街财阀不打自招
    【新华社北平九日电】塔斯社纽约讯：美国垄断资本家、大投机家和证券交易所经纪人的喉舌华尔街日报，露骨地承认北大西洋公约废弃了联合国的原则。该报在五日的社论中就北大西洋公约签订于联合国大会开幕前夕一事评称：“这两件事接连发生，令人想到是有意安排的，用以炫耀暴力法则在世界规模上胜过国际合作，所以，姑不论怎样说，北大西洋公约确实废弃了联合国的原则。北大西洋公约的发起人可以反对把它叫做暴力法则，但是最粗略地分析一下，就可以看出来用以掩盖它的文明的外装是很单薄的。这使得军事力量在国际关系上成为决定的因素。”但是，华尔街日报对于华盛顿之以暴力法则和野蛮力量代替国际合作原则和人类的理智，并不表示遗憾。相反的，该报声称：“我们对于这些事情，并不惋惜，而且我们也不信这种说法，即因为北大西洋公约否定了联合国的原则，就不应该有它。我们认为：北大西洋公约的暴力法则比较联合国理想的人类原则要更合实际些。”
