Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 28th: Moscow dispatch: Léap, General Secretary of the General Confederation of Labour (CGT) of France, recently published an article in *Trud* discussing the struggle of French workers to defend peace. Léap wrote: Approximately eighteen months ago, the CGT resolutely stepped forward to oppose the Marshall Plan. Even at that time, the French working people clearly understood that the Marshall Plan was a plan by American imperialism to establish world hegemony and prepare for a third world war against the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies. Léap pointed out that the CGT has relentlessly exposed the French government's measures regarding the German question, the so-called "European Union," and the North Atlantic Treaty. The CGT recently launched a movement against converting peaceful industries into arms production. It is necessary to counter the government's attempt to place the working class in the predicament of "either manufacturing munitions or facing unemployment." Léap emphasized that the CGT has actively participated in the movement for peace and freedom, and in the preparatory work for the World Peace Congress. French workers and employees have spoken out at every trade union meeting against the threat of war, and declared that the unity of the proletarian ranks is essential for defending peace. The French masses are steadily consolidating their unity. The French people do not want war, and the French government will have to consider this growing strength of the French people.

　　法国人民不要战争！
  　劳动群众英勇维护和平
    勒里普著文论述
    【新华社北平二十八日电】莫斯科讯：法国总工会总书记勒里普顷在劳动报上著文论述法国工人维护和平的斗争。勒里普写道：大约在十八个月以前，总工会坚决地挺身而出，反对马歇尔计划。甚至在那时，法国劳动人民就清楚地知道：马歇尔计划是美国帝国主义建立世界霸业和准备反苏、反人民民主国家的第三次世界大战的计划。勒里普指出，法国总工会不屈不挠地揭露法国政府关于德国问题，所谓“欧洲联盟”和北大西洋公约的措施。总工会最近发动了一个反对把和平工业转为军火生产的运动。必须反击政府把工人阶级置于“不是制造军火就是失业”的困境的企图。勒里普着重指出，总工会曾经积极参加争取和平与自由的运动，和世界拥护和平大会的筹备工作。法国工人和职员在每一次工会集会上都发言反对战争威胁，并宣告：无产阶级队伍的团结，是保卫和平所必须的。法国人民大众正在稳步地巩固他们的团结。法国人民不要战争，法国政府将不得不考虑法国人民这种日趋增加的力量。
