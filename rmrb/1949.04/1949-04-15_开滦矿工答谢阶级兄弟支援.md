　　Kailuan Miners
  　Thank Class Brothers for Support
    [Tangshan Electricity] The struggle of Kailuan coal mine workers against the capitalists' "profiting capital at the expense of labor" and for safeguarding the life safety of workers, has won the enthusiastic support of the broad masses of workers in Tianjin, Beijing and Tangshan. They have sent delegations, written letters, and sent telegrams of condolence, demonstrating the strong unity of the working class. The Preparatory Committee of the Kailuan Coal Mine Workers, on the 9th, wrote a letter on behalf of all the mine workers to express their thanks, grateful for the warm condolences, encouragement, and support given by the class brothers in various places. They consider this a glorious page in the history of the Tangshan miners' struggle. The letter stated: "Under the correct leadership of the Communist and Democratic Government of Tangshan and the Preparatory Committee of the Trade Union Federation, especially with your strong support, our struggle has achieved initial victory." It also stated: "But in order to fully realize the conditions and thoroughly guarantee the life safety of the workers, we must strengthen unity, heighten vigilance, and continue to work hard to achieve final victory, and use our active restoration and development of production to support the front, so that the People's Liberation Army can cross the Yangtze River as soon as possible and liberate all of China."

　　开滦矿工
  　答谢阶级兄弟支援
    【唐山电】开滦煤矿职工反对资本家“利资害劳”，维护职工生命安全的斗争，获得平津及唐山市广大工友的热情支援，纷纷派代表团、写信、打电报慰问，显示了工人阶级坚强的团结力量。开滦煤矿职工筹委会于九日代表全矿工友写信道谢，感激各地阶级弟兄给予的亲切慰问、鼓励和支援。认为这是唐山矿工斗争史上的光荣之页。信中说：“在唐山的共产党民主政府及职工总会筹委会的正确领导下，特别是你们坚强的支援，使我们的斗争获得初步胜利。”又说：“但为了全部实现条件，彻底保证职工生命安全，我们尚必须加强团结，提高警惕，继续努力，以取得最后胜利，并用我们积极恢复与发展生产支援前线，使解放军早日打过长江，解放全中国。”
