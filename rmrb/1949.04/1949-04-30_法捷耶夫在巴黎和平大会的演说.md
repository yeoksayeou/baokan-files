Fadeyev's Speech at the Paris Peace Congress
    Translated by Ding Ming and Ji Yin

    There is a word in the world now, a word that has been used more and more frequently to intimidate people recently, and that word is "propaganda." To avoid misunderstanding my report, I must first declare that I will engage in propaganda advocating peace and opposing warmongers. I am not saying that advocating peace and opposing warmongers is my profession. I am a writer. Like many of my colleagues, I prefer to write books about the peaceful lives of the people, especially because the most distinctive feature of the lives of the people in our country is peaceful labor. However, the social conscience represented in this hall, which gathers representatives of nationals, intellectuals, and manual laborers from more than sixty countries, people of different political beliefs and religions, that is, the social conscience that greatly excites us and sends a voice of truth and humanity to the world despite all the efforts of the enemies of peace and humanity, urges me to wholeheartedly support the cause of justice.

    I cannot say that war has come to our door, but the reason why war has not come to our door is only because the people do not want war. This has been proven by our peace congress, which is of great significance.

    On behalf of the cultural workers and millions of manual laborers of our great Soviet motherland, I would like to extend my heartfelt greetings to all of you, our close friends and brothers in the struggle to consolidate peace!

    I would also like to take this fortunate opportunity to extend my greetings to the French intellectuals and the French people, who have demonstrated outstanding creativity in this great cause of defending peace, and to all the people who are hosting us here in France. As everyone already knows, it may be more appropriate to say this because there are people in France who are not too willing for us to be here.

    War has not yet come to our door, but it is already a real threat for tomorrow. There are some very simple things that not only every thinking person knows, but even every school-age child knows.

    For example, who doesn't know that, contrary to the wishes of the people, an arms race is underway in some countries in Western Europe and the Americas? Newspapers and pamphlets from all over the world have repeatedly published figures and facts in this regard. These things could have been easily suppressed, but the people are increasingly aware of this fact due to increased taxes and rising living costs. Wouldn't it seem to be the simplest thing in the world for the four powers to reach an agreement on disarmament in order to reduce the burden on the people and eliminate the danger of war?

    Atomic weapons cannot be regarded as defensive weapons; this is common sense. Because it is primarily designed to destroy cities and things of cultural value, and to massively eliminate the old, the weak, women, and children. In this sense, atomic weapons are the most inhumane weapons ever used against humanity.

    Prohibiting the manufacture of this weapon and its use for war purposes, and establishing supervision over the implementation of this decision, wouldn't that seem to be the simplest and clearest thing? This is even simple and understandable for children. However, there are people and even newspapers in the world who regard this simple and clear proposal as "propaganda," and on the other hand, they consider their infinitely chaotic and illogical ideas as "freedom" and "democracy" to justify the arms race and the use of atomic weapons. Maps are circulating in countries around the world, and these maps are even published in magazines. In these maps, one can see a large string of military bases crossing Greenland, Iceland, Britain, Portugal, Spain, Germany, Greece, the Near East and Middle East countries, Pacific islands, China and Japan. The vast majority of these bases are thousands of miles away from the countries that established them. Every elementary school student understands that these bases cannot be considered defensive bases, no one is threatening the countries that established these bases; on the contrary, the existence of these bases constitutes the most terrible threat to world peace. Every literate person who reads the newspaper every day knows that, although the Second World War has ended, foreign troops are still stationed in Greece, Egypt, Transjordan, Iran, Indonesia, Vietnam, and other countries. They all know that the foreign armed forces stationed in these countries are against the will of the people of these countries, and these forces actually constitute a hotbed of new wars.

    However, as soon as the voice of truth about the above-mentioned facts and other well-known facts is issued, those who are related to the existence of these facts and their newspapers distort and distort the truth that even elementary school students understand, and even more, they fill their ambiguous and illogical ideas as the highest expression of "freedom" and "democracy."

    It has only been four years since dozens of countries, large and small, freed themselves from the bloodiest war the world has ever seen. They emerged from the war after close cooperation to defeat the forces that dreamed of world hegemony and launched the war. This close cooperation among countries in the righteous war naturally led to the United Nations organization. It would seem to be the simplest thing to solve all the conflicts that occur between countries in this United Nations agency that grows on the basis of cooperation. But that is not the case. There is such a force in the world that needs a "Western European Union" and a so-called "North Atlantic Treaty Organization." And a certain "Mediterranean Group" is also appearing on the horizon.

    The countries of the world have not had time to forget the disaster of German fascism, and some people are already trying to drag West Germany, its un-dismantled war industrial potential, and Nazi cadres, rampant cannibals, into the so-called "Atlantic Federation."

    But what are the motives and arguments of the glorifiers of atomic weapons and military blocs (who are causing real war dangers to countries around the world)? One of the most common arguments is that these groups are established to resist the alleged threat of aggression from the Soviet Union. However, everyone has seen the peaceful efforts of the Soviet Union, knows that there has never been any attempt to involve the Soviet Union in these groups, and knows that the initiators of these groups rejected the peace treaty proposed by Stalin, the great leader of the Soviet state. They also put forward another strange argument. According to this argument, the people of the so-called "Atlantic Federation" countries are "monopolizing" culture and humanism, while we, the Soviet people, the successors of Pushkin and Tolstoy, Mendeleev and Pavlov, the Soviet people who created the world's first socialist country with our own hands, are said to be enemies of "Western, Atlantic" culture. But can anyone who truly advocates culture and humanism imagine the development of the human spirit without the great Russian literature, science, and music? Is it possible to justify launching a new world war, the most barbaric war of its kind, as "necessary" simply because one disagrees with the nature of the cultural development that has encompassed the lives of nearly 70 nationalities and 200 million people in the Soviet Union for 30 years? They ignore the fact that the new socialist culture of the Soviet people is developing on the soil prepared by the great predecessors. They ignore the fact that the free life of the Soviet people under socialist conditions cannot but add new value to the cultural wealth of mankind, and if one hopes to achieve mutual understanding between countries, at least this new value must be made known to people.

    Some say that faithfulness to national traditions, faithfulness to the motherland of the people who give birth to the new Soviet culture, is hindering the Soviet people from understanding the so-called "Western culture." But doesn't everything great in the culture of France, England, Italy, and the United States grow on the land of its own people? Isn't the true culture of all mankind great and brilliant because it is the result of the cultural development of dozens or hundreds of large and small nations, each of which has made its own unique, unrepeatable contributions? Only with loyalty to our motherland and the struggle against all the great-unity theories in our country can there be respect and love for everything advanced and progressive in the culture of every country. Is there anyone who does not know that it is precisely in the Soviet Union that the classical works of many countries and the works of modern progressive writers are translated and published more than anywhere else, world music is studied in conservatories and music schools, and the idea of uniting all progressive forces against war in the world is one of the great ideas used to nurture our youth and grow up with the sacred concept of patriotism?

    I would like to ask, which country's culture do the glorifiers of atomic weapons and military blocs love? In 1948, a book written by William Vogt appeared in New York, entitled "Road to Survival." The preface to this book was written by the famous American politician Baruch. In his so-called scientific analysis of the fate of mankind, Vogt started from Malthus's theory. As everyone knows, according to Malthus's theory, the basic contradiction of human survival is the result of the fact that the increase in the human population is faster than the increase in natural resources that maintain human survival. Therefore, Malthus believes that war, plague, disease, poverty, and hunger are inevitable and beneficial factors for mankind.    (To be continued)

　　法捷耶夫在巴黎和平大会的演说
    丁明、吉茵  译
    现在世界上有一个字，这个字近来越来越经常地被用来恐吓人民，这个字就是“宣传”。为了避免对我的报告的误解，我首先必须声明，我将从事拥护和平与反对战争贩子的宣传。我并不是说和平与反对战争贩子的宣传是我的职业。我是一个从事写作的人。如象我的许多同人一样，我更喜欢写作人民的和平生活的书籍，尤其是因为我们国家人民生活的最具特色的特点便是和平劳动。但是，在这一聚集着六十多国国民、知识分子和体力劳动者的代表，不同政治信仰和宗教信仰的人的大厅中所代表的社会良知，也就是尽管和平与人道之敌人的一切努力，而使我们大为兴奋的、向世界发出真理与人道之呼声的社会良知，敦促我全心全意支持正义的事业。
    我不能说战争已临我们家门，但是战争之所以没有降临我们家门只是因为人民不希望战争。——这已由我们这次具有重大意义的和平大会证明。
    我谨代表我们伟大的苏维埃祖国的文化工作者和千百万的体力劳动者，向你们全体——我们在巩固和平的斗争中的密友和兄弟——衷心致意！
    我也愿趁这一幸运的机会，向在这一保卫和平的斗争的伟大事业中表现了卓越的创造力的法国知识分子及法国人民，向在法国此地招待我们全体的人们致意。大家已经知道的，由于法国有着并不太愿意我们到这里来的人，所以这样讲也许更见恰当。
    战争尚未到临我们家门，但是已经是明天的实际威胁。有一些很简单的事，不仅每一个能思想的人都知道，而且连每一个学龄儿童也知道。
    举例说，谁不知道：与人民的愿望相反，军备竞赛正在西欧及美洲的一些国家进行呢？全世界各国的报纸和小册子，已再三地公布过这方面的数字和事实。这些东西本来可以轻易地扣住不发表，但人民由于赋税的增加和生活费用的上涨日渐认识到这一事实。四强之间应就裁减军备问题取得协议，以减轻人民负担和排除战争危险，看起来不是世界上最简单的事情吗？
    原子武器不能被视为是防御的武器，这是很普通的常识。因为它首先是设计来毁灭城镇和有文化价值的东西，大规模消灭老弱妇儒。在这一意义上说，原子武器是有史以来用来对付人类的最不人道的武器。
    禁止这一武器的制造及其应用于战争目的，并建立对执行这一决定的监督，这看来不是最简单明了的事情吗？这甚至对小孩子都是简单和可以了解的。但是，世界上有这种人甚至报纸，视这种简单而明白的建议为“宣传”，而另一方面，他们却认为他们的混乱无比而不合逻辑的念头为“自由”和“民主”，以辩护军备竞赛和原子武器的使用。世界各国正流行着一些地图，这些地图甚至在杂志中发表。在这些地图中，人们可以看到穿越格陵兰、冰岛、英国、葡萄牙、西班牙、德国、希腊、近东和中东的国家、太平洋岛屿、中国及日本的一大串军事基地。这些基地中的绝大多数距建立这些基地的国家都有数千哩之遥。每一个小学生都了解：这些基地不能认为是防御性基地，没有任何人威胁建立这些基地的国家，相反，这些基地的存在，却构成对全世界和平的最可怕的威胁。每个天天阅读报纸的识字的人都知道，尽管第二次世界大战业已结束，外国军队仍然驻留在希腊、埃及、外约旦、伊朗、印尼、越南、及其他国家，他们都知道，驻留在这些国家的外国武装部队是违反这些国家的人民的意志的——这些部队实际上构成了新战争的温床。
    但是关于上述事实及其他众所周知的事实的真理呼声一发出，与这些事实的存在有关的人以及他们的报纸就曲解和歪曲甚至小学生都明白的真理，甚至更有进者，他们把他们的暖昧而不合逻辑的念头充作“自由”“民主”的最高表现。
    自从数十个大小国家自世界上从未有过的血腥的战争中摆脱出来，为时不过四年。它们在密切合作击败了那些梦想世界霸权而发动战争的力量之后，从战争中摆脱出来。各国在正义战争中的这一密切合作自然地产生了联合国组织。在这一从合作的基础上生长起来的联合国机构中来解决各国间所发生的一切冲突，看来似乎是最简单的事情了。但事实却不是这样。世界上有这样一种势力，它需要“西欧联盟”及所谓“北大西洋公约”。而且某种“地中海集团”也正在地平线上呈现。
    世界上的国家还没有来得及忘记德国法西斯的掺祸，就已有人又在企图把西德及其未拆卸的战争工业潜力以及纳粹干部——猖獗的吃人野兽——拖入所谓“大西洋联邦”。
    但是，原子武器和军事集团的歌颂者（他们正使全世界各国遭遇真正的战争危险）的动机和论据是什么呢？最普通的论据之一是说什么这些集团之建立是为抵抗，据说出自苏联的侵略威胁。但是，每一个人都看到苏联的和平努力，都知道并不会有过任何使苏联参加这些集团的试图，都知道这些集团的发起者拒绝了苏维埃国家的伟大领袖斯大林所建议的和平公约。他们还提出了另一个古怪的论据。按照该论据，所谓“大西洋联邦”国家的人民是“独占”文化和人道主义的，而我们苏联人民，普希金和托尔斯泰、门得雷叶夫和巴夫洛夫的继承者，用自己的手创造了世界上第一个社会主义国家的苏联人民，据说却是“西方，大西洋”文化的敌人。但是，难道有什么真正主张文化和人道主义的人，能够离开伟大的俄罗斯文学、科学和音乐而想象人类的精神的发展吗？难道，仅以不同意三十年来范畴着苏联约近七十个民族两万万人民的生活的文化发展的性质，就可能为发动新的世界大战之类最野蛮的战争辩护，说那是“必需的”吗？他们无视：苏联人民的新的社会主义文化是在伟大先行者们所准备的土壤上发展起来的。他们无视：苏联人民在社会主义条件下的自由生活，不能不给人类的文化财富增加了这样的新价值，如果希望达到国与国间的互相了解，至少须使这种新价值为人所知。
    有人说，忠实于民族传统，忠实于生育新苏联文化的人民的祖国，是在阻碍苏联人民了解所谓“西方文化”。但是，难道法兰西、英吉利、意大利和美国的文化上每一件伟大的东西，不都是在其本国人民土地上生长起来的吗？难道整个人类的真正文化之成为伟大灿烂，不是由于它是数十个数百个各自作了它们自己独特的、不能复制的贡献的大小民族的文化发展的结果吗？有对于我们祖国的忠诚和对我们国家中各种大一统主义理论的斗争，才能有对每一个国家文化上一切先进、进步的东西的敬和爱、难道竟有这样的人，他不知道恰恰是在苏联，许多国家的古典作品和现代进步作家的作品翻译和出版的分量多于其他任何地方，世界音乐在音乐院和音乐学校中研究着，而全世界一切反对战争的进步力量团结一致的观念，是与神圣的爱国观念一起被我们用以培育我国青年长大的诸伟大观念之一吗？
    我愿意问一问，原子武器和军事集团的歌颂者们爱那一国的文化？一九四八年，纽约出现了威廉。瓦格特所写的一本书，名字叫“生存之路”。这本书的序言是著名的美国政治家巴鲁区写的。瓦格特在其对人类命运的所谓科学分析中，从马尔萨斯的理论出发。大家知道，照马尔萨斯的理论，人类生存的基本矛盾是人类的增加较维持人之生存的自然资源增加得快的结果。因此，马尔萨斯就认为战争、瘟疫、疾病、贫穷和饥饿是不可避免的，是对人类有利的因素。    （未完）
