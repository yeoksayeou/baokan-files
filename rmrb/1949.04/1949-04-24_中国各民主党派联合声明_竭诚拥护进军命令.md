Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, April 23rd: On April 23rd, China's democratic parties issued a joint statement, the full text of which is as follows:

　　China's democratic parties fully endorse the order to advance issued to all People's Liberation Army soldiers on the 21st of this month by Chairman Mao of the Chinese People's Revolutionary Military Commission and Commander-in-Chief Zhu of the People's Liberation Army, and wholeheartedly support it in order to swiftly and thoroughly eliminate all reactionary forces that resist stubbornly, and to complete the task of liberating all of China. China's democratic parties deeply believe that the peace negotiations conducted previously by the CCP delegation and the Nanjing delegation, and the domestic peace agreement reached, are fair and reasonable, beneficial to the people and the country, and especially enable patriotic people with a sense of justice within the Nanjing reactionary forces to obtain the opportunity to participate in the construction of a democratic and peaceful new China. However, the responsible elements of the Nanjing government have failed to abandon their policy of relying on American imperialism, willingly accepted Chiang Kai-shek's orders, and resolutely refused to accept the peace agreement drafted by both delegations, only causing the people of southern Jiangsu to suffer increased pain. The responsibility for the war that they bear is truly inexcusable.

　　China's democratic parties further deeply believe that the dangerous situation currently faced by the Nanjing reactionary group commanded by Chiang Kai-shek is already hopeless. In addition to popular resentment and a lack of fighting spirit among the soldiers, the contradictions and divisions manifested within, and the situation of economic and financial collapse caused by military defeats, completely determine that the Nanjing government has no ability to resist, and will ultimately fall into a tragic situation of total destruction.

　　Based on this shared understanding, China's democratic parties are willing, on this day of the army's advance and victorious unfolding, to make a solemn announcement to the people of the whole country and to patriotic people within the Nanjing Kuomintang: In all liberated areas, all the people must step up production, obey laws, and mobilize to support the front lines. In the areas where the People's Liberation Army is fighting, and in the areas that will be attacked, all democratic parties and people from all walks of life must work hard to mobilize, welcome the liberating army, assist in killing the enemy, and protect all important materials from destruction. Finally, within the reactionary Nanjing Kuomintang, there are still many people who are loyal, patriotic, and understand the advantages and disadvantages. We still place great hope in them, and in accordance with the third and fourth principles of the order issued by Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, we will proceed with local peaceful resolution methods to reduce the suffering of the people, and not join Chiang Kai-shek in inviting the same fate of destruction.

　　Li Jishen, Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang
　　Shen Junru and Zhang Bojun, Standing Committee Members of the China Democratic League
　　Huang Yanpei, Standing Director of the China Democratic National Construction Association
　　Ma Xulun, Standing Director of the China Association for Promoting Democracy
　　Tan Pingshan, Standing Committee Member of the Chinese Kuomintang Three People's Principles Comrades Association
　　Peng Zemin, Chairman of the Supervisory Committee of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party
　　Li Zhangda, Central Executive Committee Member of the China National Salvation Association
　　Cai Tingkai, Chairman of the Chinese Kuomintang Democratic Promotion Association
　　Chen Qiyou, Chairman of the Central Committee of the China Zhi Gong Party
　　April 23rd

　　中国各民主党派联合声明
  　竭诚拥护进军命令
    【新华社北平二十三日电】四月二十三日中国各民主党派发表联合声明，全文如下：
    中国各民主党派，对于本月二十一日中国人民革命军事委员会毛主席及人民解放军朱总司令向全体人民解放军所发布之进军命令，完全表示赞同，并竭诚拥护以求迅速彻底消灭一切负隅抵抗之反动力量，完成解放全中国之任务。中国各民主党派深信前此中共代表团与南京代表团所进行之和平谈判，及其所达成之国内和平协定，为公允合理，有利于人民与国家，而对于南京反动势力下有正义感之爱国人士，尤使能获得参加民主和平新中国建设之机会。然而，南京政府负责分子，竟不能放弃依赖美帝国主义之政策，甘受蒋介石之命令，断然拒绝接受双方代表所拟定之和平协定，徒使江南人民增加痛苦，其所负之战争责任，实无可宽贷。
    中国各民主党派更深信蒋介石所指挥之南京反动集团，现在所处之危险局势，已属绝望，在人民怨愤，士无斗志以外，其内部所表现之矛盾与分化，及经济财政因军事溃败而招致总崩溃之形势，完全判定南京政府绝无抵抗之能力，而最后必陷于全部灭亡之惨局。
    中国各民主党派基于共同之认识，愿乘此大军前进，胜利展开之日，向全国人民及南京国民党内爱国人士，作郑重之宣告：在一切解放区，全体人民，必须加紧生产，服从法令，动员支前，在解放军作战之区域，及将进攻之区域，所有各民主党派及各界人民，必须努力动员，迎接解放大军，协助杀敌，并保护一切重要物资，免受破坏。最后，南京反动国民党内，尚不乏忠贞爱国、明晓利害之人士，吾人仍寄予甚大之期望，依照毛主席朱总司令所发布命令第三第四两项原则，进行局部和平解决之方法，以减少人民之灾难，而不与蒋介石共招同一灭亡之命运。
    中国国民党革命委员会主席李济深　中国民主同盟常务委员沈钧儒章伯钧　民主建国会常务理事黄炎培　中国民主促进会常务理事马叙伦
　中国国民党三民主义同志会常务委员谭平山　中国农工民主党监察委员会主席彭泽民　中国人民救国会中央执行委员李章达　中国国民党民主促进会主席蔡廷锴　中国致公党中央委员会主席陈其尤　四月二十三日
