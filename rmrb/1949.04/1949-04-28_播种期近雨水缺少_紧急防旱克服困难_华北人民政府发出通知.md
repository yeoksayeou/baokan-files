　　Sowing Season Approaches with Lack of Rain
    Emergency Drought Prevention to Overcome Difficulties
  　North China People's Government Issues Notice
    [From Our Newspaper] The North China People's Government issued an emergency notice on the 27th of this month, launching a drought prevention mobilization, calling for ensuring timely sowing. The full text of the notice is as follows: (No separate document will be issued)
    To all Administrative Offices, Provincial and Municipal Governments:
    The sowing season is now upon us, but due to lack of rainfall in vast areas of North China, sowing is encountering difficulties. In order to not miss the agricultural season and to ensure timely sowing, all regions should take the following measures:
    1. Conduct drought prevention mobilization among the masses, promote the drought prevention methods used by the masses in previous years, introduce past experiences in drought resistance and sowing, organize the masses to start early, carry water for planting, so as to ensure the sowing of spring seedlings. Special attention should be paid to organizing and guiding the sowing of cash crops such as cotton and peanuts, as their sowing period is even shorter. In areas with suitable conditions, watering of wheat seedlings should be carried out. If there is still no rain after emergence, and there is a risk of drought withering, lead the masses to protect the seedlings.
    2. Maximize the use of water resources, utilize available canals, wells, and pools for sowing, and pay attention to water management to save water. Expedite the completion of water conservancy projects, and mobilize the masses to build small-scale water conservancy projects such as small canals, permeable wells, water storage ponds, and artificial water lifting. Repair old wells, old waterwheels, and old canals on a large scale, and the government will provide necessary assistance. Local loans should also be used as much as possible in water conservancy.
    3. In the drought resistance and sowing movement, special attention should be paid to the organization of labor and animal power, and women's labor should be mobilized to participate in this movement. After rainfall, when there is a need for rush planting, the adjustment of labor and animal power should be organized to ensure immediate sowing.
    Ensuring timely sowing is currently extremely urgent and must be regarded as an urgent central task, organized and implemented with great effort. The situation of drought resistance and sowing should be reported by telegram at any time.

　　播种期近雨水缺少
    紧急防旱克服困难
  　华北人民政府发出通知
    【本报讯】华北人民政府于本月二十七日发出紧急通知，进行防旱动员，号召保证按时播种，通知全文如下：（不另行文）
    各行署、省市政府：
    目前播种季节已届，唯华北广大地区因雨水缺少，播种遭到困难，为了不误农时，保证按时播种，各地应作如下措施：
    一、在群众中进行防旱动员，发扬群众历年防旱办法，介绍过去抗旱下种经验，组织群众，即早动手，担水点种，以保证春苗下种；棉花、花生等经济作物播种期更为短促，应特别注意组织指导，有条件地区要做到麦苗浇水；如出苗后仍不落雨，有旱枯之虞者，即领导群众进行保苗。
    二、尽量发挥水力，运用可能利用的水渠、水井、水池，进行播种，并须注意使水管理以节省水量，加紧完成兴修水利计划，并发动群众修小水渠、透河井、积水池、人工扬水等小规模的水利。大量修复旧井、旧水车、旧水渠，政府并给以必要的扶助。各地贷款，亦应尽可能的用到水利方面来。
    三、在抗旱下种运动中，要特别重视劳畜力的组织工作，并动员妇女劳力参加这一运动。在落雨后，需要抢种时，更应组织劳畜力的调剂，以保证即时下种。
    目前保证及时播种异常迫切，必须视为紧急的中心任务，用大力组织实现，并将抗旱下种情形随时电告。
