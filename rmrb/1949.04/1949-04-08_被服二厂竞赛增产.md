　　Clothing Factory No. 2 Competition Increases Production
    ▲In order to welcome the "May Day" holiday, Clothing Factory No. 2 in Beiping has launched a labor competition. Fifteen-year-old apprentice Li Youlin said, "My job-seeking performance was too poor last month, so I must work harder this time to make more pieces." Zhou Lu Lin and others worked until after 10 p.m. and still didn't leave. On the 7th, before working hours in the morning, the work rooms were already full of workers working.

　　被服二厂竞赛增产
    ▲北平市被服二厂为迎接“五一”节，掀起劳动竞赛，十五岁的学徒李有林说：“上月找工作成绩太差，这次一定要加劲多做几件。”周路麟等一直工作到深夜十点多钟还不走。七日早上还没有到上班时间，工作房间已坐满了工人在工作。
