Awarded the title of "All-Army Female Comrade Model"
　　Ding Zhihui has been commended five times
[Report from this newspaper] Comrade Ding Zhihui, the hospital director of a field hospital under a certain unit of the Fourth Field Army, has been working selflessly in the army for ten years, healing countless wounded soldiers, and has been awarded the title of "All-Army Female Comrade Model" by the unit. During the last five years of the War of Resistance Against Japan, Comrade Ding Zhihui was commended four times by higher authorities for her consistent active and responsible work. She was selected as a model cadre member of the New Fourth Army Health Department Sanatorium and a first-class model worker in the Subei Huaihai Division. In 1945, she went north with the army to participate in the Northeast Liberation War. In an emergency situation when the troops were retreating north, she and other staff members led civilian laborers, carrying some of the wounded, braving wind and sand for twenty-eight days. Along the way, they took care of the wounded, providing treatment, and carefully managed and educated the civilian laborers, finally overcoming countless dangerous environments and successfully transferring the wounded to their destination. When the troops were resting in Xifeng County, Liaoning Province, she often braved the rain to visit the wards to care for the patients. She said, "Patients cannot be denied treatment because it is raining. Delaying for one minute will increase the patient's risk by one point!" Sometimes, in order to care for the patients, she did not hesitate to sacrifice her sleep and meal times. At that time, some people said, "The ward is her home." Because she loved the patients, the patients also regarded her as a relative and missed her. If they didn't see her for a while, they would shout, "Why hasn't the director come yet!" Seeing her was like bathing in the sunlight in winter, feeling warm and happy. During the Tianjin Campaign, she performed operations on the wounded in the front-line operating room for several days and nights in a row. Due to overwork, she became ill, with a fever of over 40 degrees Celsius. She still worried about her work and murmured in a coma, "It doesn't matter if I sacrifice myself, but if the wounded are not operated on quickly, the casualty rate will increase." The next morning, as soon as her fever subsided, she dragged her shaky body to the second facility to operate on more than twenty wounded soldiers, finally falling ill again due to physical weakness. But after her second fever subsided, she selflessly went to perform surgery on the wounded again. After the Tianjin Campaign, she led the entire hospital in a blitz treatment, again creating treatment results that shocked the entire army.

　　荣膺“全军女同志模范”称号
  　丁志辉五次受表扬
    【本报讯】第四野战军某部野战医院院长丁志辉同志，十年如一日的在部队中忘我工作，治愈无数伤员，荣获该部“全军女同志模范”的称号。丁志辉同志曾在抗日战争的后五年内，由于一贯工作积极负责，先后得到上级四次表扬，被选为新四军军卫生部休养所的模范干部党员，及苏北淮海分区一等模范工作者。一九四五年，随军北上，参加东北解放战争。在一次部队北撤的紧急情况下，她和其他工作人员，率领民工，带了一部份伤员，冒风沙跋涉二十八天。一路上一面照顾伤员，进行治疗，一面慎密地掌握、教育民工，终于克服无数险恶环境，胜利地把伤员转运到目的地。部队在辽宁省西丰县休整时，她经常冒雨到各病房去看护病号，她说：“病人不能因为下雨而不要治疗，拖延一分钟就会使病人增加一分危险！”有时为了看护病号，她不惜牺牲睡觉和吃饭时间。当时有人说：“病房就是她的家。”由于她热爱病号，病号也把她当做亲人般惦念着，一时见不到她，就喊：“院长怎么还不来啊！”见到了她，就象冬天浴身在太阳光下一样感到温暖、愉快。天津战役中，她在前线手术室里一连好几昼夜给伤员们开刀，由于过度疲劳而得了病，发烧到四十度以上。她仍记挂着工作，在昏迷状态中喃喃自语：“牺牲自己没有关系，要是不给伤员迅速开刀，伤亡率会增大的。”第二天上午热度刚退，下午就拖着摇幌的身体，到第二所去给二十几个伤员开了刀，终于因身体虚弱而又病倒了。但在第二次退烧后，她又忘我地去给伤员动手术了。天津战役后，她领导全院进行了一次突击治疗，又创造了惊动全军的治疗成绩。
