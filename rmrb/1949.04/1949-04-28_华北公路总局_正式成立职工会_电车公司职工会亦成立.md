　　[Our Newspaper] The North China Highway Bureau held a worker representative meeting on the 22nd of this month to formally establish a trade union. A total of 123 representatives from the Hebei Provincial Highway Bureau, Pingbao Engineering Office, Beiping Equipment Depot, Repair Shop, Transportation Office, and Automobile Branch attended. Representatives from the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the Beiping Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, and the Beiping Postal Administration Trade Union Preparatory Committee also participated. At the meeting, the draft constitution of the trade union and various representative proposals were read and discussed. He Zhong, Wang Ruomei (female), and 15 others were elected as executive committee members of the trade union, with four alternate executive committee members. The presidium of the meeting announced the proposals from the representatives: (1) to establish worker schools and to establish nurseries and kindergartens; (2) to strengthen the unity of new and old workers; (3) to organize family members to engage in production and supply raw materials; (4) to establish investigation and visitation agencies to separately visit the lives of workers' families; (5) to establish public funds and strengthen the performance appraisal system; (6) to re-examine membership qualifications. The above proposals were explained by the presidium and handed over to the newly elected executive committee of the trade union to study implementation measures.
　　[Our Newspaper] The inaugural meeting of the Beiping Tram Company Trade Union was held yesterday (the 27th) at the Beiyang Cinema. Nineteen units, including the Pingjin Railway Bureau, sent representatives to congratulate. Workers at the Pingjin Clothing Factory, who had previously had minor conflicts with tram workers due to provocations by the Kuomintang reactionaries, expressed their apologies and requested that they strengthen unity in the future to prevent provocations.
