Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 6th: The Soviet newspaper Pravda published an article by Marinin on the 4th, exposing the aggressive military measures being implemented by American reactionaries on a wide scale.

Marinin writes: Among the various aggressive signs of the North Atlantic Treaty, the most important is the extremely extensive military measures being implemented by the United States in cooperation with Britain and France. Wall Street is linking the strengthening, reorganization, and re-equipment of Western European countries' armies with the North Atlantic Treaty. The issues being discussed include a significant increase in the number of troops of various services and the transformation of the continental military system into an element of the American military system, managed by representatives of the American General Staff. Preparatory measures have already been implemented with the help of two organizational centers: the first is the so-called US-UK Joint Chiefs of Staff; the second is the Western European Union General Staff. Now that the North Atlantic Treaty has been signed, American militarists intend to accelerate the Americanization of Western European weapons on a larger scale. According to official American announcements, the scale of the new weapons delivery plan has not yet been determined, but the numbers mentioned by some newspapers roughly equate to the appropriations of the Marshall Plan. According to official sources, all assistance activities related to the new military lend-lease plan will be directed by a special assistant to the Secretary of State. Thus, exporting various military equipment and intensifying preparations for aggression are becoming one of the most important tasks of American foreign policy. This task will be executed by the State Department. The American ruling clique is increasingly turning the State Department into a part of the armed forces' General Staff. The ongoing organizational restructuring can be said to extend to the diplomatic sphere. General Carter, who recently arrived in London, is an official with the rank of minister, tasked with controlling British "defense." In London, the United States also has a "European Liaison Committee" to supervise the distribution of items delivered under the military lend-lease act. Negotiations are also underway in Washington between representatives of the US Army and the French Chief of Staff. According to a report in the Paris newspaper Le Monde, these negotiations concern the "urgent needs of the French Army," which, bluntly put, means "the urgent needs of the American General Staff." According to the London Daily Mirror, Washington is planning to hold a secret military conference with the participation of Eisenhower, Montgomery, and others. All of this is a fully eloquent commentary on the North Atlantic Treaty. Undeniable facts shatter the myth of the so-called "defensive" nature of the North Atlantic Treaty, revealing that the purpose of this product of Wall Street and the City of London is aggression.

### 美帝的诡辩破产　华尔街的目的在于侵略  真理报揭露美帝武装西欧阴谋

　　美帝的诡辩破产
  　华尔街的目的在于侵略
    真理报揭露美帝武装西欧阴谋
    【新华社北平六日电】苏联真理报于四日发表马里宁的论文，揭露美国反动派正在实行具有侵略性的广泛的军事措施。马里宁写道：北大西洋公约各种侵略迹象中最具重要性的，就是美国在英法合作之下所实行的极广泛的军事措施。华尔街把加强西欧各国军队的整顿与重新装备和北大西洋公约联系在一起，正在讨论的问题，就是各种兵种人数的大大增加，以及把大陆军事系统转变为美国军事系统的一个要素，由美国参谋部的代表予以管理。筹备措施业已在两个组织中心的帮助下实行：第一个就是所谓美英联合参谋部；第二个就是西欧联盟参谋部。现在，北大西洋公约签字了，美国军国主义者就打算加速更大规模地实行西欧武器的美国化。据美国官方宣布，新的武器交割计划的规模尚未确定，但是，某些报纸提到的数目，约略相当于马歇尔计划的拨款。根据官方消息判断，有关新军事租借计划的一切援助活动，将由国务卿的特别助理来指导。这样，输出各种军备和加紧准备侵略，正成为美国外交政策最重要的任务之一。这个任务将由国务院负责执行。美国统治集团正将国务院愈来愈变成武装部队参谋部的一部分。现在进行中的组织整顿，可以说也及于外交方面。新近抵达伦敦的卡德将军，是公使级的官员，任务是控制英国的“防务”。在伦敦，美国还设有“欧洲联络委员会”，以监督按军事租借法所交割的东西之分配。美国陆军代表和法国参谋总长之间，现在也在华盛顿进行谈判。据巴黎世界报报导，这次谈判是关于“法国陆军的紧急需要”，这句话戳穿了讲，就是“美国参谋部的紧急需要”。据伦敦每日写真报消息，华盛顿正在筹划举行秘密军事会议，有艾森豪威尔、蒙哥马利及其他人等参加。所有这一切，都是对北大西洋公约的充分雄辩的评论。无可争辩的事实，粉碎了关于北大西洋公约的所谓“防务”性质的神话，昭然若揭地证明了这一华尔街和伦敦城的出品的目的在于侵略。
