　　Southern Marching Army Passes Through Southern Hebei
　  Jinan Branch
　  Strict Discipline
　　The mighty Southern Marching Army, passing through various parts of southern Hebei, every soldier conscientiously implemented the Three Main Rules of Discipline and the Eight Points for Attention.

　　When the army passed through Fanbao Village, a vendor accidentally gave a soldier 500 yuan too much in Hebei currency. The soldier only realized it after walking one or two *li*, and immediately ran back to return the extra money in full. The cavalry stationed in Hanzhuang, fearing they would damage the trees of the common people, the handlers wrapped their own bedding around the trees. When a certain squad was stationed in Baixiang, a staff member of the Huimin Grain Store, seeing that the soldiers were all smoking dry tobacco, felt bad and bought several packs of cigarettes for the soldiers, but the soldiers firmly declined. The impression the Southern Marching Army gave to the people of southern Hebei is just like the "Strict Discipline" banner that the masses of Southern Zhanghe presented to a certain regiment, which will fly all over the country.

　　Worthy of Being the People's Own Army
　　In every village where the army was stationed, the masses unanimously praised: apart from the People's Own Army, where in the world could one find such an army? A squad stayed at the home of Ma Laonan, and the soldiers not only swept the house and courtyard clean but also carried out basket after basket of manure that had been piled up in the cowshed for a month. Old Nan hurriedly tried to stop the soldiers from carrying the baskets and劝止 them, and said with emotion: "You are working too hard, take a rest, you still have a long way to go!" He regretted not having cleared the manure from the cowshed earlier. Another squad stayed at the home of Hao Zhenyu in Linmingguan, and the soldiers, disregarding their meal, helped Zhenyu's son gin cotton; some treading, some feeding, they ginned a large pile of cotton in half a day. After the troops left, Zhenyu told everyone about this. As soon as a certain company was stationed in Tian Village, a soldier was sitting and resting at the door when he saw an old man of about sixty going to the well to fetch water, so he hurried over to help him carry the water, delighting the old man who grinned and patted the soldier on the shoulder, saying: "Truly worthy of being the people's own army!"

　　Open Price Reduction and Secret Price Reduction
　　The citizens of Nangong, in order to express their warm support for the Southern Marching Army, all public and private businesses uniformly reduced prices. Daily necessities and essentials such as toothbrushes, toothpaste, towels, socks, etc., were all sold to the passing army at prices 15 to 20 percent below market prices. Supply cooperative branches were also set up in larger villages and towns near the highway, such as Hanzhuang and Donglizhuang, specializing in selling goods at low prices. A man selling carrots in Mubi Village, seeing the magnificent Southern Expeditionary Army coming, smiled with his mouth open in excitement. When the troops bought his vegetables, knowing that the troops would definitely not accept them for free, he sold the public price of 1,000 yuan for four *jin* to the soldiers for 1,000 yuan for seven *jin*. And happily said to others: "This is my secret salute, secret price reduction, to the People's Liberation Army."

　　Sending Eggs
　　Many villages and towns' primary school students organized comfort groups and *yangge* teams, and whenever the army arrived, they were active in front of the soldiers. The Xunzhai Primary School *Yangge* Team performed *yangge* and flower drum dances for the army, and the soldiers were so happy they couldn't close their mouths. Then the comfort group came, with eggs, noodles, peanuts...stuffing them randomly into the soldiers' bags. A twelve-year-old primary school student happily presented an egg to a soldier, with the words written on the egg: "Eat this egg, strengthen your heroic courage, fight to the South, and capture the war criminals alive."

　　Old Woman Bai
　　In Ximeng Village, Ningnan, the emancipated woman Old Woman Bai (a military dependent), when the army entered the village, she excitedly called the soldiers to stay at her house. In the evening, she brought out all eight quilts that her family of three used, but the soldiers refused to use them. Old Woman Bai insisted, saying: "You are marching so hard to liberate all the people of the country, I can't bear to let you suffer, even if I don't sleep for two nights." The soldiers had no choice but to keep seven quilts, and Old Woman Bai went to sleep peacefully. The next day, when the army left, they left a letter for the old woman, which said: "Please wait, old woman! When we cross the Yangtze River and completely defeat the Kuomintang reactionaries, we will come home with your son to see you!"

### 南下大军过冀南

　　南下大军过冀南
    冀南分社
　  纪律严明
    浩浩荡荡南下的某野战军，行经冀南各地，每个官兵都认真的执行了三大纪律，八项注意。
    路经范堡村的大军，一个卖馍馍的多找给战士冀南票五百元，战士走了一、二里路才发觉，即刻跑回来把多找的钱如数还给了。驻韩庄的骑兵，怕咬了老百姓的树，饲养员们把自己的包袱皮包在树上。某班驻在柏乡时，惠民粮店的伙友，见战士都吸旱烟，心里过意不去，买了几盒纸烟给战士，战士坚决谢绝了。南下大军给冀南人民的印象，正如南漳淮群众，赠给某团“纪律严明”的大红旗一样，将在全国飞扬。
    不愧为人民的子弟兵
    凡大军所驻村庄，群众一致的称赞者：除了人民子弟兵，天下哪有这样的军队。马老南家住的一个班，战士除把屋子、院子打扫的干干净净外，又把牛棚里积了一个月的粪堆一筐筐抬出来。老南慌忙向战士们夺筐劝止，并且感动的说：“你们太辛苦了，休息休息，还要走长路呢？”他后悔自己没有早把牛棚的粪推出来。住在临名关郝振玉家的另一个班，战士不顾吃饭，帮助振玉的儿子轧花；蹬的蹬、续的续，半晌轧了一大堆棉絮。队伍走了以后，振玉便到处述说着这件事。刚住在田村的某连，一个战士正在门口坐着休息，看见一位六十左右的老大爷去井边担水，便急忙跑去替他担水，喜的老头撇着大嘴，拍着战士的肩膀说：“真不愧为人民的子弟兵！”
    明减价与暗减价
    南宫市民，为了表示对南下大军的热烈拥护，各公私营商号一律大减价。牙刷、牙粉、毛巾、袜子……等日用品和必需品，一律低于市价百分之十五至二十出售给过路大军。并在公路附近的韩庄、东里庄等较大村、镇设有供应合作分社，专门低价售卖。木鼻村一个卖红萝卜的，望见雄伟的南征大军来了，兴奋的张着嘴笑。部队买他的菜，他知道白给部队一定不要，便把一千元四斤的公开价，卖给战士为一千元七斤。并高兴的对别人说：“我这是给人民解放军的暗敬礼，暗减价。”
    送鸡蛋
    许多村庄和城镇的小学生，都组织了慰问团、秧歌队，每逢大军到来，他们便活跃在战士面前。寻砦小学生秧歌队，给大军扭秧歌、打花棍，战士正在喜的合不上嘴，慰问团又来了，鸡蛋、挂面、花生，………乱往战士袋里塞。一个十二岁的小学生拿着一个鸡蛋笑喜喜的送给战士，鸡蛋上还写着：“吃了这鸡蛋，壮壮英雄胆，打到江南去，活捉大战犯。”
    白老大娘
    宁南西孟村，翻身妇女白老大娘（军属），当大军一进村，她兴奋的把战士叫在她家住。晚上，她把全家三口盖的八床被子都拿出来，战士不用，白老大娘说啥也不行，她说：“你们行军这样辛苦，是为了解放全国老百姓，我两夜不睡，也不能叫您受罪。”说的战士没法，只好留了七床，白老大娘这才安生的睡觉去了。第二天大军走时，给老大娘留了一封信，信上说：“请大娘等着吧！等我们渡过长江，把国民党反动派彻底打垮了，和你儿子一块回家看你！”
