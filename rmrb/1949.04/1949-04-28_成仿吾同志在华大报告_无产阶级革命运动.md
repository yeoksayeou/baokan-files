　　Comrade Cheng Fangwu's Report at North China University
  　The Proletarian Revolutionary Movement
    [Report from this newspaper] To commemorate the "May 1st" Labor Day, Comrade Cheng Fangwu, Vice President of North China University, gave a report to more than two thousand students of the First Department on the morning of the 27th, entitled: "The Proletariat and the Proletarian Revolutionary Movement." Principal Cheng first explained the four characteristics of the working class: First, it is the most oppressed and exploited class at the bottom of society. If the working class wants to turn itself over, it must transform the entire class society. Therefore, the interests of the working class are completely consistent with the interests of the entire oppressed people, and its interests can represent the interests of the majority of the people. Second, the working class has no property, no means of production, and relies entirely on wages to eat. Revolution can only make the working class lose the chains around its neck. They are not selfish or self-interested. They want to eliminate private property and build a completely equal society without exploitation and oppression. Third, it is the most organized. They are organized by large industries and capitalists, so they are the easiest to unite and accustomed to organized life. This is reflected in their methods of struggle, whether it is strikes, demonstrations, or street battles with reactionary government troops, everything is organized. Fourth, it is internationalist. The interests of the Chinese proletariat are consistent with the interests of the foreign proletariat, and narrow nationalistic concepts do not exist.
    Due to the above four characteristics, the working class is the most determined and thoroughgoing revolutionary class.
    Principal Cheng continued to elaborate on the history of the proletariat's struggle, and emphasized that during the First World War, the Russian working class, under the wise leadership of its leaders Lenin and Stalin, turned the imperialist war into a civil war, overthrew the reactionary Tsar, and established a proletarian dictatorship socialist Soviet Republic. It eliminated reactionary rule on one-sixth of the world's land, overthrew the bourgeois regime, and gave imperialism a severe blow, influencing the oppressed people in colonial and semi-colonial areas to rise up against imperialism, and deepened the overall crisis of capitalism. This was the first great victory of the world proletariat. The victory of the anti-fascist war in the Second World War defeated the three most reactionary imperialist countries of Germany, Italy, and Japan, weakened the forces of imperialism, and aggravated the overall crisis of capitalism. On the contrary, socialist countries have become more consolidated, and many new democratic countries have been added to the world. The strength of the proletariat has become stronger, which is the second great victory of the world proletariat. At present, in our China, the army is crossing the Yangtze River, liberating Nanjing, and national victory is about to come. The Chinese New Democratic Revolution is a part of the world proletarian revolution, and the victory of the Chinese revolution will be the third great victory of the world proletariat.
    Principal Cheng's report gave the students a great education.

　　成仿吾同志在华大报告
  　无产阶级革命运动
    【本报讯】为了纪念“五一”劳动节，华北大学副校长成仿吾同志于二十七日上午给第一部两千余同学作报告，题目是：“无产阶级与无产阶级革命运动”。成校长首先说明工人阶级的四个特点：一、它是社会最下层最受压迫与最受剥削的阶级。工人阶级要翻身，必须把整个的阶级社会改造过来，所以工人阶级的利益，和整个被压迫人民的利益是完全一致的，它的利益能代表大多数人民的利益。二、工人阶级没有财产，没有生产工具，完全靠工资吃饭，革命只能使工人阶级失去勒在他脖子上的锁链。他们毫不自私自利，他们要消灭私有财产，来建设一个完全平等没有剥削和压迫的社会。三、它最有组织性，他们被大工业和资本家组织起来，所以他们最容易团结，习惯于组织生活，表现在他们的斗争方式上，无论罢工、游行或和反动政府军队巷战的时候，一切都是有组织的。四、它是国际主义的，中国的无产者和外国的无产者底利益是一致的，狭隘的民族观念是不存在的。
    由于以上四个特点，所以工人阶级是革命最坚决最彻底的阶级。
    成校长继续详述了无产阶级的斗争历史，并着重指出第一次世界大战，俄国的工人阶级在它英明的领袖列宁、斯大林的领导下，把帝国主义战争变为国内战争，推翻了反动的沙皇，建立了一个无产阶级专政的社会主义苏维埃共和国，在全世界六分之一的土地上消灭了反动统治，推翻了资产阶级的政权，给帝国主义一个严重的打击，影响了殖民地半殖民地的被压迫人民起来反对帝国主义，加深了资本主义的总危机，这是世界无产阶级第一次伟大的胜利。第二次世界大战反法西斯战争的胜利打垮了德、意、日三个最反动的帝国主义国家，削弱了帝国主义的势力，加重了资本主义的总危机。而相反的社会主义国家更加巩固，并在世界上又添了许多新民主主义国家，无产阶级的力量更加壮大，这是世界无产阶级第二次伟大的胜利。目前我们中国，大军过江，解放南京，全国胜利就要到来，中国新民主主义革命，是世界无产阶级革命的一部分，中国革命的胜利将是全世界无产阶级第三次伟大的胜利。
    成校长的报告，给同学们一个很大的教育。
