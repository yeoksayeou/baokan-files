　　Economic Crop Planting Underway; Lai, Zhuo, and Other Areas Revise Plans
　　The Lai Zhuo County Party Committee recently inspected and revised the planting plans for economic crops, and conducted self-criticism regarding subjective leadership. In February, when the county formulated a peanut planting plan, the Industrial Department subjectively estimated that the county had planted a total of 24,917 mu of peanuts last year (the actual planting was only 10,289 mu). Based on this estimated figure, the county party committee submitted a plan to the district committee to plant 50,000 mu of peanuts. At that time, many village cadres and representatives reflected that the task could not be completed, but the county party committee did not conduct in-depth investigation and research. Instead, it emphasized that this was a "political task" and demanded that the district guarantee its completion. As a result, a forced planting situation was formed from the county to the district and from the district to the villages. Beiqishan Village in the Second District, which is fundamentally unsuitable for planting cotton and peanuts, was also assigned to plant more than 100 mu. A representative from Nanhuning Village in the Fourth District was so worried about not being able to complete the district's required figures that he was on the verge of tears. The First District required villages to write triplicate forms and guarantees, forcing the masses to commit to planting. The masses were very dissatisfied and said to the district cadres: "Don't worry about whether I plant or not. Can't I sell peanuts and cotton in the autumn to repay it?" The masses thought they were planting peanuts for the public. After the county party committee discovered this, it immediately inspected and improved, and made a review at an expanded cadre meeting. It is now conducting inspections at each level to strive to improve production leadership. (Du Senyao)
　　[Jizhong News] In leading the Second District of Zhengding, based on the different soil qualities and the habits of the masses in the district, the promotion of special crops was carried out, and the subjective error of equally dividing the number of mu was corrected in a timely manner. The county originally planned to plant more than 23,000 mu of cotton and more than 26,600 mu of peanuts. After the plan was arranged, no attention was paid to investigation and research or appropriate allocation, and it was simply distributed equally based on the total number of mu in each village, without making detailed explanations. For example, Dongciting Village, which had not planted cotton in the past, was assigned to plant 523 mu of cotton. After the responsible comrade of the district party committee discovered this situation, he immediately convened a meeting of various departments to discuss ways to correct it. At the village branch secretary meeting, the actual situation was studied, and the problem of equal distribution was initially changed, but it was still not thorough enough. For example, the soil quality in Dongkou Village is not suitable for planting peanuts, but a certain amount of peanuts was still retained. Some farmers said: "It's no good to plant too much, and it's not worth guarding if you plant too little, it's not even enough for badgers to eat!" After the responsible comrade of the district party committee heard this reflection, he conducted further research. At the second village cadre mass production inspection meeting, the restrictions on numbers and crop types were broken. According to different soil qualities and the habits of the masses, three different regions were divided: the southwest is a cotton-producing area, which can specialize in cotton planting without being assigned peanut planting tasks. The north is a peanut-producing area, which can specialize in peanut planting. The southeast is a region suitable for both cotton and peanut planting, and both can be planted. In this way, cotton reached more than 30,200 mu, exceeding 27 percent of the district's task. Peanuts reached more than 20,000 mu, which is about 20 percent less than the total required number for the district. This excellent style of concrete arrangement based on soil quality and the habits of the masses, proceeding from reality, provides a concrete guarantee for increased production.

　　经济作物正值播种涞涿等地修正计划
    浃涿县委最近检查修正了种殖经济作物的计划，并对主观主义的领导进行了自我批评。二月间，该县订花生种植计划时，实业科主观的估计去年全县共种花生二万四千九百十七亩（实际仅种一万零二百八九亩），县委根据此估计数字，即向地委提出了种花生五万亩的计划，当时许多村干部、代表反映完不成任务县委也未深入调查研究，即强调这是“政治任务”，要区里保证完成。因此，形成县向区、区向村的强迫派种。二区北起山村，根本不适宜种棉和花生，也布置了一百多亩。四区南胡宁村代表怕完不成区的要求数字，愁得要哭。一区要村写三联单、打保证条，逼着群众认种。群众很不满，向区干部说：“你不要管种不种，秋后我卖花生棉花缴还不行？”群众认为是给公家种花生。县委发现后，即检查改进，并在扩大干部会议上作了检讨，现正逐级检查，力求改进生产领导。  （杜森尧）
    【冀中讯】正定二区领导上，根据本区不同的土质与群众习惯，推广特种作物，及时纠正了主观上平均分派亩数的错误。该县原布置植棉二万三千多亩，植花生二万六千六百余亩，布置后没注意到调查研究，适当分配，只根据各村土地总亩数，平均分配下去，也没有作详细解释。如东慈亭村过去就不种棉花，却布置了五百二十三亩棉花。区委负责同志发现了这种情况后，马上便召集了各部门会议，商量纠正的办法。在村支书会议上，研究了实际情况，初步改变了平均分配的毛病，但仍不够彻底。如东叩村的土质，本不宜种花生，但仍留有一定数量的花生。有的农民说：“种多了不成，种少了值不得看管，还不够獾吃的！”区委负责同志听到了这种反映后，又进行了研究，在第二次的村干大生产检查会议上，打破了数字与作物种类的限制，根据不同的土质与群众习惯，划分三种不同地区：西南是产棉区，可以专种棉花，而不分配种花生的任务。北部是产花生区，可以专种花生。东南部是棉花花生都适宜种植的地区，可两样兼种。这样，棉花达到了三万零二百多亩，超过了全区任务的百分之二十七。花生达到了两万多亩，不足全区总要求数字百分之二十的样子。这种根据土质与群众习惯的具体布置，从实际出发的优良作风，使增产有了具体保证。      （本报记者药夫、文哲）
