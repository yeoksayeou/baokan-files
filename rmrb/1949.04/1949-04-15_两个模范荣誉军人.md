　　Two Model Honorable Servicemen
　　Honorable serviceman Zhang Zanle is from Nanbanqiao Village, Second District, Qinshui. He joined the Anti-Japanese Dare-to-Die Corps in 1937 and was wounded in the battle of Eastern Mountain in Linfen in 1939, returning home to rest. After recovering, he joined the 57th Regiment of a certain Taiyue unit in 1941. In 1941, he retired home due to a serious illness. At that time, the rent reduction and interest rate reduction movement was in full swing here. He joined the movement, actively leading the masses to settle accounts with the landlords and implement rent and interest rate reductions. In the large-scale conscription movement of 1944, he led thirty-two young people to join the army. In 1945, he gloriously joined the Communist Party of China. In 1946, he was wounded in the chest, back, and kidneys in the Yicheng battle, losing his ability to fight. After recovering from his injuries, he was discharged and returned home. After returning to his village, Comrade Zhang Zanle continued to actively help the village cadres with their work, organizing and leading the masses in production, and helping other honorable servicemen. For example, once he, Zhang Wenxi, and Zhang Haibao went to the county government to attend a meeting for honorable servicemen. Zhang Wenxi and others said to him, "The masses are not good to us, they can't get along with us, and the cadres are not good to us either." Comrade Zhang Zanle said to them, "We should first examine ourselves to see if there is anything we have done wrong. We received more education in the army than the masses. If they don't approach us, we should take the initiative to approach them and let them understand us first." He educated the other honorable servicemen in this way. After returning from the meeting, he encountered conscription, so he actively publicized and introduced the learning, mutual assistance, and friendship in our army units, and mobilized new soldiers. When winter school started, he attended every time. He took the initiative to read newspapers to the masses, explain current events, and publicize victory news, which was very popular with the masses, so they elected him as a volunteer teacher. He taught even more patiently. More than thirty men and women in the whole natural village were able to attend the lessons on time every day. Because he was humble and patient, and able to enthusiastically help others, everyone consulted him whenever they had any problems. In the summer of 1947, he saw in the newspaper that the combination of production and armed forces was needed, so he actively promoted it among the militia. After deliberation, he organized mutual aid teams that combined production and armed forces. At this time, there was a drought, so he led the drilling of wells for irrigation and organized the masses to sell steamed buns and engage in transportation, overcoming the disaster. He actively participated in the mass movements over the years, but never took more than a little bit of the fruits of the masses. In the initial party rectification, he was also an activist. When adjusting the leadership composition, he was initially elected as a member of the branch committee, and finally elected as the secretary of the branch. Currently, Comrade Zhang Zanle has become the leadership core of his village.
　　Comrade Zhang Taisheng is from Hangxi Village, Gaoping. He joined our troops at the age of eighteen in 1941. He was wounded in the Fushan Campaign in 1945, and his left arm was disabled. He retired from the army in 1946, and the government resettled him in Jiaozhuang Village, Qinshui. At that time, it was the spring famine, so he lent the grain allocated to him by the government to six households including Zhang Zongshan and Du Laiwang who had nothing to eat. In the spring of that year, the land reform movement was in full swing. He actively participated in it, publicized and mobilized, and organized the masses to struggle, establishing a good influence among the masses. In the land reform, he was allocated land, houses, farm tools, furniture, and livestock. He only had one arm and could not hoe or cut, only carry burdens and herd cattle, so he exchanged work with the masses to farm the land. He was able to work actively, picking up wheat while herding cattle, picking up seven dou in one summer. He was very frugal. If he couldn't eat all the grain he harvested, he would buy livestock and purchase utensils, and his life became better and better. But he was still a bachelor, eating at other people's houses and having to ask someone to make his clothes. Because he was upright and able to actively participate in production and live frugally, in the spring of 1947, the village chief and the secretary of the women's association automatically introduced him to a partner, and both parties voluntarily married. At the wedding, more than fifty families in the village came to help. Although he was an outsider and disabled, he did not feel any difficulties in the problems that arose during the marriage because the masses helped him. Now, Zhang Taisheng's family is even better established. (Taiyue Branch of the New China News Agency)

　　两个模范荣誉军人
    荣誉军人张赞乐是沁水二区南板桥村人，一九三七年参加了抗日决死队，一九三九年临汾东山战斗时负伤，回家休息。伤好后，一九四一年又参加了太岳某部五十七团，一九四一年因重病又退休回家。当时，减租减息运动已在这里轰轰烈烈地开展起来了，他投入运动，积极领导群众，向地主算帐，实行减租减息。一九四四年大参军运动，他又带领三十二个青年参军，一九四五年他光荣的参加了中国共产党。一九四六年他在翼城战斗中，胸、背、肾三处负伤，失去了作战能力，伤好后复退伍回家。张赞乐同志回村后仍积极帮助村干部工作，组织、领导群众生产，并能帮助其他荣誉军人。如有一次他和张文喜、张海宝等到县政府开荣誉军人会议，张文喜等对他说：“群众对咱不好，和咱搞不到一起，干部对咱也不好。”张赞乐同志对他们说：“咱们应先检讨自己是不是有不对的地方，咱们在部队上比群众受的教育多，他不接近咱，咱要主动接近他，让他们先了解咱。”这样教育了其他荣誉军人。开会回去后，正碰上参军，他便积极宣传介绍我军部队中学习、互助、友爱等情况，动员新战士。上冬学时，他每次都去参加，他主动给群众读报、讲解时事、宣传胜利消息，群众十分欢迎，就选他做义务教员，他更加耐心的教学，全自然村三十多个男女，每天都能按时去学习。由于他虚心耐心，又能热心帮助别人，所以谁有什么问题都找他商量。一九四七年夏天，他看到报纸上说生产武装要结合的消息，他积极在民兵中进行宣传，经过酝酿后，组织了生产武装结合的互助组。这时正当天旱，他就领导打井浇地，并组织群众卖蒸馍、搞运输，渡过了灾荒。历年来的群众运动，他都积极参加了，但从没有多占群众一点果实。初步整党中，他又是积极分子，当调整领导成份时，初选为支部委员，最后选为支部书记。目前张赞乐同志已成为他村的领导核心了。
    张太胜同志，是高平沆西村人，十八岁一九四一年时参加我部队。一九四五年浮山战役负伤，左胳膊失去效能。一九四六年退伍，政府给安置在沁水交庄村。当时正值春荒，他就把政府拨给他的粮食，借给张宗善、杜来旺等六户没吃的。当年春天适值土地改革运动，他便积极参加，并宣传动员，组织群众斗争，在群众中树立了良好影响。土地改革中，他分到了土地房屋、农具家具和牲口。他只有一条臂，不能锄、不能割，只能担挑、放牛，他就和群众变工种地。他能积极劳动，放牛时捎带拾麦，一夏天就拾了七斗。他十分俭省，打下的粮食吃不了，买牲口置用具，光景越过越好。但他还是个独身汉，吃饭还在别人家，穿衣仍得找人作，由于他为人正派，又能积极参加生产，节俭度日，一九四七年春，村长、妇会秘书等，即自动给他介绍了个对象，双方自愿结了婚。结婚时，全村五十多家都来帮忙。他虽是个外路人，自己又是个残废，但他在结婚中的一些问题，都由群众帮助丝毫没感到困难。现在，张太胜的家务就建立得更好了。（太岳分社）
