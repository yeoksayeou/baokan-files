　　Eliminate Bureaucracy and Strengthen Planned Production

　　[Tianjin Electric] After the Tianjin Municipal Enterprise Company was taken over by the People's Government Public Works Bureau, workers in various factories began to establish a new attitude toward labor and actively engaged in production. However, due to many unreasonable systems and bureaucratic institutions left over from the Kuomintang rule, necessary reforms were not carried out. At the same time, production was unplanned, resulting in factory losses. In order to reform this unreasonable enterprise structure, the company began to reorganize and reduce redundant personnel in early March, and prepared a cost calculation table. Starting from both increasing revenue and reducing expenditure, the organization of each factory will also be reorganized in the future, and a factory management committee will be set up to carry out preliminary democratic management.

　　天津市企业公司
  　革除官僚制度加强计划生产
    【天津电】天津市企业公司经人民市政府公用局接管后，各厂工人工作开始树立了新的劳动态度，积极进行生产，由于国民党统治时代遗留下来许多不合理制度，与官僚机构，没有进行必要的改革，同时又是无计划性的生产，以致工厂赔本。为了改革这种不合理的企业机构，三月初旬公司方面已经着手整理裁减冗员，作出成本计算表。从开源节流两方面着手进行，今后各个厂的组织亦将予以整理，筹组工厂管理委员会，作初步的民主管理。
