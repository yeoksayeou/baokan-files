Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 12th. The people of Northern Jiangsu are tensely mobilized to support the People's Liberation Army's crossing of the river to the south. After the Northern Jiangsu Support the Frontline Headquarters issued an emergency mobilization order, under the leadership of all cadres and Communist Party members, the vast majority of people in the region were involved in this movement. A large number of standing laborers, skilled boatmen, and sailors, after training, have set off for designated locations. In the rear, 12,000 cadres led a million people to carry out transportation, road repair, grain milling and other work. A huge amount of military grain and fodder has been concentrated to ensure an adequate supply for the southward army. More than one hundred military supply stations have been set up in areas along the river, preparing a large number of vegetables, cooking oil, salt and daily necessities, ready to supply military needs at any time. Through the tense efforts of the people of the entire region, more than 3,000 li of highways have been repaired, and 969 bridges have been built, making transportation throughout Northern Jiangsu unimpeded. Farmers in villages along the transportation lines automatically vacated and cleaned their houses, prepared bedding and straw mats, and installed stables and troughs in preparation for the accommodation of the southward People's Liberation Army. Factories everywhere have launched production competitions to support the People's Liberation Army. Workers at a certain flour mill milled flour and rice for the People's Liberation Army day and night, and porters bravely transported grain and materials under enemy strafing. Since the Liberation War, the people of Northern Jiangsu have suffered greatly from the ravages of the Kuomintang reactionaries. In the first year of the war, more than 40,000 people in the area were slaughtered, and more than 100,000 women were raped. When they saw that the People's Liberation Army was about to cross the Yangtze River and advance south to liberate the whole country, they excitedly contributed all their strength to strive for the complete victory of the liberation cause.

    【新华社华中十二日电】苏北全区人民紧张地动员起来支援南下解放军渡江。苏北支援前线司令部发出紧急动员令后，在全体干部和共产党员带头下，全区广大人民均卷入此一运动。巨大数额的常备民工，熟练的船夫和水手经过整训后，已开赴指定地点。在后方，一万二千个干部率领百万人民进行运输、修路、磨粮等工作。巨大数目的军用粮草已经集中，保证南下大军的充足供给。沿江各地区并设立了一百多个随军供应站，准备了大批菜蔬、油盐及日常用品，随时供应军需。全区人民经过了紧张的努力，已经修复公路三千多里，造桥九百六十九座，使苏北全境交通畅通无阻。交通沿线村庄农民自动腾出和打扫房屋，备好床铺垫草，安好马棚马槽，准备南下解放军住宿。各工厂普遍掀起了生产竞赛，支援解放军。某面粉工厂工人夜以继日的为解放军磨面磨米，搬运工人在敌机扫射下，仍勇敢搬运粮食物资。自解放战争以来，苏北人民曾受尽了国民党反动派的蹂躏。在战争的第一年中，该区被屠杀的人民达四万余人，被奸淫的妇女在十万以上。当他们眼见人民解放军即将渡江南进，解放全国时，他们兴奋无比地贡献出一切力量，以争取解放事业的完全胜利。
