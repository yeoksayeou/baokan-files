    The China People's Bank Peiping Branch has achieved good results in purchasing silver dollars and silver. Since the bank began posting purchase prices on March 7, it has purchased 24,543 silver dollars and 24,376 taels of silver as of March 28. Among them, during the first price posting period (a total of March 7 to 16), 6,756 and a half "big head" silver dollars were purchased, along with 803 "small head" silver dollars, and 587 and a half foreign silver dollars. After the price adjustment on the second occasion (March 17), the number of purchases sharply increased because the price of small heads and foreign coins was raised relatively significantly (the first quoted price was 190 yuan for a big head, 120 yuan for a small head, the small head price accounting for 63% of the big head price; the second quoted price was 230 yuan for a big head, 190 yuan for a small head, the small head price accounting for 82% of the big head price, a 19% increase compared to the first time). From March 17 to 28, over twelve days, a total of 5,916 and a half big heads, 1,743 small heads, and 8,736 and a half foreign coins were purchased. There was a significant increase in small heads and foreign coins. The silver purchase also showed a similar situation: since the silver price was adjusted to 230 yuan per tael on the 17th, the amount of silver purchased has gradually increased. For example, only over 970 taels were purchased on the 17th, but the amount purchased on the 28th reached 5,127 taels. In addition to purchasing silver dollars, the bank also confiscated 10,278 silver dollars. These confiscated items were all from those who speculated or traded in violation of the People's Government's laws and decrees, or who privately carried them out of the country.
