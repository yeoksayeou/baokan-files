　　Cooperative Bank Business Department
　　Loans to Support Handicraft Industry
　　[Our Newspaper] The small production loans provided by the Ping City Cooperative Bank's Business Department to support small handicraftsmen have been enthusiastically applied for. As of the 13th, 23 households had completed loan procedures within five days, and 70-80% of them had already used the borrowed funds to purchase raw materials or tools and officially started production. These small producers include those making cloth shoes, braiding straw ropes, making soap, ironware, making copper wire mesh, knitting socks, the transportation industry, toothbrushes, weaving cold cloth, weaving cloth, and making batteries, totaling 11 industries. The loan amounts varied depending on the needs, with the largest amount being 80,000 RMB and the smallest being 4,000 RMB. Other households borrowed amounts ranging from 10,000-20,000 to 30,000-40,000 RMB. The total amount of loans issued was 632,915 RMB. The loan term: the longest is three months, and most are one month. The loan interest rate is determined based on the producer's profit and turnover capacity: small handicraft loans have a monthly interest rate of 9-12%, and transportation industry loans have a monthly interest rate of 12-15%, which is equivalent to a real monthly interest rate of 0.3-0.6%. According to the person in charge of the bank, there are more than 100 types of handicraftsmen in Beiping, and the initially determined support targets include nine types such as toothbrushes, papermaking, copper wire mesh, fertilizer, oil pressing, ironwork, knitting, and bamboo and wood farm tools. As for the "agricultural tool trust," which is one of the bank's main businesses, it is still under preparation. Cooperative loans are also being discussed and coordinated with relevant departments.
