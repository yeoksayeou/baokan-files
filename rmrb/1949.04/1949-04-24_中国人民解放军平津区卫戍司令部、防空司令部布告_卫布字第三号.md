Proclamation of the Pingjin Area Garrison Command and Air Defense Command of the Chinese People's Liberation Army
Wei Bu Zi No. 3

The Nanjing Kuomintang government has rejected the peace agreement and continues its counter-revolutionary war. Our People's Liberation Army on the Yangtze River front, acting on the orders of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, victoriously crossed the river on the 21st. In order to prevent the Kuomintang reactionaries from carrying out air raids and sabotage against our rear cities, to protect the lives and property of the people in the Pingjin area, and to safeguard industrial and commercial construction and the ancient capital's culture, this Headquarters is ordered to concurrently serve as the Pingjin Area Air Defense Command and is directly responsible for air defense matters in Beiping. Tianjin Municipality will be concurrently handled by the Tianjin Garrison Command. The following air defense measures are hereby announced:

First: All soldiers and civilians must be urgently mobilized, and air defense facilities shall be commenced from this date. In addition to the troops having their specific organization and tasks, the agencies, factories, schools, and streets in the city shall be uniformly responsible by the Municipal Air Defense Committee, establishing air defense organizations for each unit and carrying out air defense tasks.

Second: The regulations for air raid warning signals are divided into four types:
    A. Preliminary Alarm—Issued when intelligence is received of an enemy aircraft approaching and there is concern that the city may be subjected to an air raid. The signal is two long tones. Upon hearing this signal, the military police should immediately deploy and carry out their tasks in accordance with the regulations of this Headquarters; civilians, except those who are organized to undertake air defense duties, should immediately evacuate on their own and carry out air defense according to the organization of each unit.
    B. Emergency Alarm—Issued when enemy aircraft are approaching the urban area. The signal is one long and two short tones. Upon hearing this signal, the military police should quickly enter their designated air defense and alert positions. Civilians should quickly complete their own evacuation and enter air defense shelters; those who are responsible for air defense duties should immediately prepare to perform their duties.
    C. Imminent Alarm—Issued when enemy aircraft have entered the city's airspace. The signal is a continuous short tone. Upon hearing this signal, martial law should be immediately implemented. Except for military police performing duties who are permitted to pass, and those from agencies, factories, schools, and streets who are responsible for duties within their respective units, all pedestrians should stop, traffic should be cut off, and everyone should hide or lie down on the spot.
    D. All Clear Alarm—Issued when enemy aircraft have escaped and are far from the city's airspace. The signal is one long tone. Upon hearing this signal, martial law should be lifted immediately, and traffic should be restored.

Third: During the air defense period, in addition to the usual traffic regulations, in order to avoid temporary congestion and hinder air defense evacuation, the Public Security Bureaus of Pingjin municipalities are specifically tasked with designating certain streets as one-way directional roads. During martial law and traffic interruption, trams should stop immediately on the spot, and automobiles and other vehicles of all kinds should park on the right side of the street.

Fourth: In the event of an air raid at night, after the emergency alarm is issued, lighting restrictions should be implemented immediately, except for street lights. After the imminent alarm is issued, all street lights should be extinguished. Lighting control should be the responsibility of designated personnel in each unit.

Fifth: Fire brigades, rescue teams, and patrol teams should be organized by agencies, factories, schools, and streets as units, actively responsible for promptly extinguishing fires, rescuing the wounded, and arresting bandits, special agents, and saboteurs in their respective units and residences, and reporting or delivering them to the relevant departments.

Sixth: Anyone who violates the air defense regulations of this Headquarters, especially spies who indicate bombing targets for enemy aircraft, or who take the opportunity to steal, loot, set fires, or engage in other counter-revolutionary sabotage activities, the military police responsible for guard duties have the right to immediately prohibit, arrest, or take other emergency measures.

Seventh: Specific implementation measures regarding air defense will be separately stipulated by the military system and the Municipal Air Defense Committee.

This proclamation is hereby issued.

　　中国人民解放军平津区卫戍司令部、防空司令部布告
  　卫布字第三号
    南京国民党政府拒绝和平协定，继续其反革命战争，我长江前线人民解放军执行毛主席朱总司令之命令，已于二十一日胜利渡江。为防止国民党反动派对我后方城市进行空袭与破坏，保卫平津地区人民之生命财产及工商业建设与古都文化，本部奉命兼任平津区防空司令部，并直接负责北平市防空事宜。天津市则由天津市警备司令部兼任之，兹特公布防空办法如下：
    第一条：全体军民紧急动员起来，自本日起开始防空设施。除部队有其特定之组织与任务外，市内之机关、工厂、学校和街统一由市防空委员会负责，建立各单位之防空组织，执行防空任务。
    第二条：空袭警报信号之规定，分为四种：
    甲、预备警报——接获敌机来袭情报，本市已有遭受空袭之顾虑时发出之。其信号为两长音。闻此信号时，军警应立即出动，按照本部规定，执行任务；市民除有组织的担负防空勤务者外，应即自行疏散，并按各单位之组织进行防空。
    乙、紧急警报—敌机逼近市区时发出之。其信号为一长二短音。闻此信号时，军警均应迅速进入指定之防空警备位置。市民应迅速自行疏散完毕，进入防空隐蔽部；担负防空勤务者，应即准备执行勤务。
    丙、临空警报—敌机已进入市空时发出之，其信号为连续短音。闻此信号时，迅即实行戒严，除执行勤务之军警许可通过，各机关、工厂、学校、和街担负勤务者得在各该单位执行任务外，一律停止行人，继绝交通，就地隐蔽卧下。
    丁、解除警报——敌机逃逸，远离市空时发出之。其信号为一长音。闻此讯号时，即行解严，恢复交通。
    第三条：防空期间之交通，除按平时交通规定执行外，为避免临时拥挤，妨碍防空疏散起见，特责成平津两市公安局划定若干街道为定向单行路。在戒严断绝交通时，电车应即就地停驶，汽车及其他各种车辆，一律停靠街道右侧。
    第四条：夜间遭遇空袭时，在紧急警报发出后，除路灯外，立即实行灯火管制。在临空警报发出后，路灯亦一律熄灭。灯火管制应由各单位指定专人负责。
    第五条：按机关、工厂、学校、和街为单位应组织消防队、救护队、纠察队等，积极负责在各该单位住地内及时扑灭火灾、救护伤员、纠捕匪徒特务破坏分子，并向各主管部门报告或解送。
    第六条：凡有违犯本部防空规定，特别是为敌机指示轰炸目标之奸细分子，或乘机盗窃、抢掠、纵火及进行其他各种反革命破坏活动者，负责警备任务之军警有权立即加以禁止逮捕或采取其他紧急之措置。
    第七条：关于防空对空之具体实施办法，分别由军事系统及市防空委员会另行规定之。
