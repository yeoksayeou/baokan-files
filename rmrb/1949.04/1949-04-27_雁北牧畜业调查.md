　　Yanbei Animal Husbandry Survey
    Ministry of Agriculture, North China People's Government, Li Gengxin
    The area north of Yanmen Pass in Chahar Province—Fan County, Guangling, Lingqiu, Hunyuan, etc.—is lush with vegetation and a good area for breeding livestock. According to incomplete statistics from 34 districts in six counties last September, villages capable of breeding livestock accounted for more than 47 percent of the total number of administrative villages, and breeding households accounted for a little over 42 percent of the total number of households. However, livestock losses in this area have been significant due to enemy and puppet destruction and damage. Raising livestock is very common among the masses here, with generally one animal per household. Cattle breeding is more common in this area, followed by donkeys, horses, and mules. The breeding capacity is also generally large. Cattle in the Wutai Mountain area, if well-fed, can produce one calf per year, while in other areas, they can produce two calves every three years. According to a survey of six counties, the livestock breeding rate in breeding and semi-breeding areas reached 16 to 17 percent of the total livestock number last year. In Fan County and Lingqiu County, according to the situation in eleven districts, the general livestock breeding capacity is that large cows produce an average of one calf every two years, large female donkeys produce an average of slightly more than one offspring every four years, and large female horses produce an average of one foal every three years. In Yangbaiyu Village, Wutai Eighth District, there were only 50 head of cattle and 5 donkeys when the Japanese surrendered in 1945. By last autumn, there were 27 donkeys, 5 horses, 8 mules, and 110 head of cattle, almost doubling in three years. This year, the North China Government requires the entire region to breed 240,000 head of livestock. Based on this overall requirement, the breeding rate will still not reach 13 percent of the total number of livestock in the region. From this, it can be seen that achievements can be made in this area. However, there are still several issues that need attention: (1) Some artificial insemination technicians still have the view that they are afraid of being discriminated against. Efforts should be made to change their perceptions, improve their social status, and enable them to engage in livestock mating with peace of mind. On the other hand, the masses are not accustomed to keeping breeding bulls. Cattle breeding is mostly free mating, so the breed of cattle has been greatly reduced. The selection of breeding males and females is a very important issue, and the leadership should pay attention to it. (2) Regarding the issue of wartime labor service, the labor service for female animals after they are pregnant should be reduced or exempted. According to incomplete statistics from a special commissioner's office during a grain transport in Yanbei last September, as many as 19 calves were crushed to death, which is a great loss. It is hoped that the North China Government's instructions on encouraging livestock breeding will be thoroughly implemented in the future.

　　雁北牧畜业调查
    华北人民政府农业部  李更新
    察省雁门关北部——繁峙、广灵、灵邱、浑源等县，草木繁茂，是繁殖牲畜的良好地区。据去年九月六个县卅四个区不完整的统计，能繁殖的村估所有行政村总数的百分之四十七以上，繁殖户估总户数的百分之四十二强。但这一带因历经敌伪摧残、破坏，牲畜损失很大。这里群众畜养牲口很普遍，一般每家都有一个，该地牲口繁殖以牛较多，驴、马骡次之，其繁殖力一般也很大。五台山地区的牛，喂养好的能一年生一犊，其他地区能三年生二犊。据查六个县在去年繁殖区与半繁区的统计，牲畜繁殖率已达总牲畜数百分之十六、七。繁峙、灵邱两县十一个区的情况，一般的牲口繁殖力是大母牛平均每年两个生一个，大母驴平均四个生一个多，大母马三个平均每年生一驹。五台八区杨白峪村于一九四五年日寇投降时，只有牛五十头、驴五匹，截至去秋已有驴二十七头，马五匹、骡八头、牛一百一十头，三年中几乎增加两倍。今年华北政府要求在全区繁殖牲畜二十四万头，按其总要求繁殖率还达不到全区牲口总数的百分之十三，由此，可见在这一带是能够作出成绩的。但目前尚有几个问题须引起注意：（一）有些拉公子驴的技术人员，仍存有怕被人歧视的观点，应设法转变他们的认识。提高其社会地位，使其安心从事牲畜交配。另方面是群众留种牛不习惯，牛的繁殖多是自由交配的，因此牛的品种降低很多。公母畜选种是很重要的问题，领导上应加注意。（二）战勤支差问题，母畜怀驹后应该减免其勤务，去年九月间雁北一次运粮中，据一专署不完全统计，压落犊十九头之多，这是很大的损失，望今后应彻底执行华北政府奖励繁殖牲畜的指示。
