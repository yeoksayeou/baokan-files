　　Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 27th. Song Chunhua and Chen Zuozhen, workers at Tianjin Paper Company No. 1 Factory, successfully modified a paper machine and received promotions and material rewards. This is one of countless inspiring examples of the creativity of workers in the liberated areas being brought into play. The paper machine was originally a cylinder mold paper machine for making coarse paper and Lian Shi paper. When making paper, it was necessary to add hibiscus to the pulp to prevent sedimentation. Since August of last year, due to the shortage of hibiscus, the machine has been operating intermittently. At that time, Song Chunhua and several other workers had a plan to modify the machine; however, under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, either because the factory did not support it, or because they were warned by pseudo-trade union cadres, they had no opportunity to realize it. After the liberation of Tianjin, the need for newsprint greatly increased, and the factory's original output could not meet the demand, so it wanted to modify the machine to manufacture newsprint. At this time, Song Chunhua drew a sketch of the modification design and submitted it to the factory. The Industrial Department attached great importance to this news. It immediately notified the paper company to hold a production symposium to discuss the modification issue. And it was decided to organize a committee to be responsible for studying and implementing the specific measures for modification. The modification work began on April 1st. Under the guidance of Song Chunhua, the design group, repair group, and electrical engineering group followed the sketch and adopted the opinions of worker Chen Zuozhen. After seven days, the machine was modified into a dual-purpose paper machine. In addition to making newsprint, hibiscus can still be used to make coarse paper. Moreover, the amount of waste paper is reduced, the paper-making speed is increased, and both labor and fuel are saved compared to the past. In order to reward Song Chunhua and others for their contribution to the modification of the machine, the factory specially promoted Song Chunhua and Chen Zuozhen to shift leaders of Machine No. 1, and awarded Song Chunhua 500 jin of corn flour (equivalent to one month's salary, the highest in the factory) and Chen Zuozhen 300 jin of corn flour. The workers who assisted in the work were also commended. Song Chunhua said: If it were not for the liberation, a worker would not have the opportunity to contribute his technology. Although he came up with the idea for this successful modification, it still depended on the joint efforts of everyone.

　　天津纸业公司一厂工人
  　宋春化等改装造纸机成功
    【新华社天津二十七日电】天津纸业公司第一厂工人宋春化、陈作珍改装造纸机成功，得到提升和物质奖励。这是解放区工人的创造性得到发挥的无数感人的事例之一。该造纸机原为造毛边纸和连史纸的圆网造纸机。造纸时浆内须加黄蜀葵，以免沉淀。自去年八月起，因黄蜀葵缺乏，该机时开时停。当时宋春化及其他几个工人曾有改装该机的计划；但在国民党反动统治之下，或因厂方不予支持，或因受到伪工会干事的警告，没有实现的机会。津市解放后，新闻纸的需要大大增加，该厂原有产量供不应求，故欲将该机改装制造新闻纸。宋春化乃于此时画了一张改装设计的草图送交厂方。工业处得到这个消息后，极为重视。当即通知纸业公司召开生产座谈会，讨论改装问题。并决定组织一委员会负责研究进行改装的具体办法。改装工作于四月一日开始，在宋春化指导下，由设计组、修理组和电机组等依照草图，并采纳工友陈作珍的意见，历时七天，将该机改装为两用造纸机，除造新闻纸外，仍可用黄蜀葵造毛边纸。而且坏纸减少，造纸速度增加，人工燃料亦均较过去节省。为了奖励宋春化等对于改装该机的贡献，厂方特提升宋春化和陈作珍为一号机领班，并奖给宋春化玉米面五百斤（相当于全厂的最高工资一个月工资），陈作珍玉米面三百斤，对帮助工作的工友亦予表扬。宋春化表示：如果不是解放了的话，一个工人是没有机会贡献出他的技术的。这次改装成功，虽然是他出的主意，但还是靠大伙的一齐努力。
