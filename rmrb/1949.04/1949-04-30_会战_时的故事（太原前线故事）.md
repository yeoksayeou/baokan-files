　　Stories from the "Campaign"
　　(Stories from the Taiyuan Front)
　　Geng Xi
　　(I)
　　Before midnight, the outskirts of the village had already been breached by our army. The enemy was concentrated in several good courtyards, preparing to resist stubbornly.

　　The regiment commander had already, based on the direction of the enemy's mountain artillery fire and the conversations with several captured enemy soldiers, determined the location of the enemy's division headquarters; and based on this, he determined the main attack direction, allocated firepower, and deployed troops. Now, everything was ready, waiting only for the attack time to arrive, a signal, and it could begin. However, he was still deep in thought in the temporary command post's bomb shelter. This bomb shelter was dug in the open field, no more than two hundred meters from the enemy. Stray bullets whizzed past overhead from time to time. However, he still sat there quietly, without saying a word, facing the enemy side, staring absently at the red, glowing bullet trajectories in the night sky.

　　The political instructor of the main attack battalion, having accepted the repeatedly conveyed mission from the regiment commander, was about to return to prepare for its execution. But, he was very curious about what the regiment commander was still thinking about. In his opinion, this battle deployment was already very comprehensive, and their battalion had always executed orders perfectly and safely. The regiment commander was a person who liked to use his brain. What was he still worried about? ...

　　He walked towards their attack starting point, carrying this small question.

　　(II)
　　At their attack point, only the family of Wang Erhuo was still at home. They, like all peasant families in central Shanxi, had lived through such difficult days:

　　... How many families were ruined and bereaved! How many fertile farmlands have turned into wasteland! Here, only thirty miles from Taiyuan city, the patches of weeds grow more than a person tall. Yan Xishan's bandits' "soldier-farmer valley one" even lured wolves down from the mountains. They hide in the wasteland during the day, and howl in the village at night, wanting to eat people, so scary! But, even so, every family had to go to the wasteland to pick sand thistle and dig wild vegetables, return to boil bean cake soup to drink. People were so weak from hunger, they still had to suffer to death in the fields, hoping for something.

　　With great difficulty, they persevered until autumn, when the grain ears turned yellow. Yan Xishan's hook-nosed army came again, wanting to rob something to eat. The days of wolves eating people returned.

　　When Yan Xishan's soldiers entered the door, they said such nice things:

　　"This time, we've changed. We know the Eighth Route Army treats you well. This time we'll learn from them, not take a single needle or thread from the people, and we'll change even better than them."

　　However, as soon as this speaking officer left, another person entered Wang Erhuo's house, immediately rummaging through boxes and cabinets, even wanting the woman's bright red socks. And from that cabinet, he found money, picked it up and put it in his pocket.

　　Erhuo's wife stared in astonishment. The few coins earned with great difficulty could not help but make her anxious. She frowned and said timidly:

　　"Didn't your officer say not to take anything from the people!?"

　　"You're talking nonsense, I am the officer." That person took his hand out of his pocket, waved his hand, stamped his foot, and left. She had no choice but to wait for her husband to return, and tell him with a weeping face.

　　But, what could her husband do? These past two days, he had begged everywhere, even running to the doors of those high officials, but it was no use. People said: "Nonsense, our troops are 'conspiring with the people,' how could this happen." What else could the couple dare to say? ... May this world of the dead quickly pass, they could only hope that the People's Liberation Army would come quickly. ...

　　(III)
　　Now, two or three hours before the attack was to begin, the political instructor had already arrived at Wang Erhuo's house. Wang Erhuo was boiling water for the soldiers. Erhuo's wife was sitting on the kang, sewing explosive packs for the soldiers, which were to be used immediately in the battle. The sound of gunfire still rang out intermittently outside. Erhuo's wife was constantly patting the crying baby, sewing, and talking to the soldiers:

　　"Before the sun set today, I was delivering food to the hook-nosed soldiers, and I saw that their troops were so lax!"

　　"How so?"

　　Immediately, she changed her voice, imitating some of the Yan Xishan soldiers' conversations:

　　"One soldier looked at the food and said: 'Eating this, all pumpkin and corn, how can we get full?'

　　Another said: 'One division only has a little over one regiment left. I think it's better to surrender.'

　　Yet another glared his eyes: 'Humph! You surrender!?' ...

　　'Hey! Who are we fighting for! When will we tilt our hats, raise our guns like this, and then we'll be happy.'

　　'Folks, whether we can get through this depends on tonight.'

　　'Folks, watch us hand in our guns tonight.'"

　　"Comrades, did you hear what this sister-in-law said? Isn't it easy to fight these enemies?" The political instructor seized this opportunity to carry out pre-battle mobilization.

　　Erhuo's wife added: "Oh my, those troops are no good, they have nothing to eat and keep running away, stealing all our food. If you come any later, we'll starve to death this year, quickly get rid of them!"

　　"Comrades, did you hear that, this is the demand of the masses. Our task is very simple, six big characters: 'Seize the mountain artillery, capture the division commander'."

　　But, exactly which house was the enemy's division headquarters located in? This question flashed in his mind, immediately making him think of the regiment commander pondering in the command post. He was probably also calculating this, so this old woman was so familiar with the enemy, she might know, he asked, and Erhuo's wife replied:

　　"Oh my! Of course, I know, of course, I know! These past few days, we've been so badly harmed that we almost broke the threshold kicking it. Quickly have him tell you."

　　She pointed to her husband, the political instructor sent someone to invite the regiment commander, and the regiment commander came immediately:

　　...

　　"Then, do you know where the enemy's mountain artillery is?"

　　"In the alley at the entrance of the division headquarters," Erhuo interjected.

　　"How do you know that's mountain artillery?" The regiment commander was a little strange. How could a peasant know these things?

　　Erhuo said: "Comrade, you don't know how much we people are looking forward to you, we've been concerned about it for a long time, people told me it was mountain artillery!..."

　　"Oh! That cannon has two wheels!"

　　"Yes! It jumps when it fires, jumps when it fires!" Erhuo imitated the mountain artillery firing, jumping up and down happily.

　　"Right!" The regiment commander patted his shoulder and smiled.

　　Immediately, Erhuo followed the regiment commander out. The regiment commander told Erhuo his main attack direction, asking if it was appropriate. Erhuo said: It's not good to attack from the south, there's a pool there, and a slope that's hard to climb. It's better to attack from the north where the houses are low, it's an earthen wall, easy to climb, and the enemy isn't paying attention, catch them off guard. The regiment commander, based on the actual situation, immediately changed his main attack direction.

　　(IV)
　　After a few explosions and a fierce battle, the gunfire stopped. As soon as it was bright, people jumped out of their fire pits where they had been sheltering from the shells, and the streets became lively again. Wang Erhuo's wife held her child, standing at the doorway. After a while, the division commander of Yan Xishan's army was escorted over. In the group of prisoners, she saw her husband following that guy who had robbed them. Behind them, the regiment commander and political instructor of the People's Liberation Army, who had come to their house last night, also slowly walked over.

　　The regiment commander said to the political instructor: "This time in the battle, we've seen the power of our military democracy again. What should we call this battle today?"

　　"What should we call this battle?" The political instructor hadn't thought it through yet, the regiment commander interjected and said:

　　"A campaign!"

　　"Why call it a campaign? We didn't use that many people!" The regiment commander pointed to Wang Erhuo's door and said: "Look there, weren't they cooperating with us in this battle? When aren't we fighting this great campaign of the army and the people!"

　　Both of them laughed heartily, and together stepped over the threshold of Wang Erhuo's house.

　　“会战”时的故事
    （太原前线故事）
    耿西
  　（一）
    午夜前，村子外围已经被我军突破了，敌人集中在几座好院子里准备顽抗。
    团长已经根据敌人山炮发射的方向，和几个俘虏的谈话，判断了敌人师部的位置；并且根据这个确定了主攻方向，配备了火力，部署了部队。现在，万事俱备，只等攻击的时间一到，一发信号，便可以开始了。但是，他仍在临时指挥所的避弹坑里沉思着，这避弹坑是挖在野地里的，离敌人顶多不过二百公尺，流弹不时啸啸地从头上飞过。然而，他仍旧安静的坐在那里，一声也不吭，面对着敌人那边，望着夜空里红色发光子弹所划的虚线出神。
    主攻营的教导员，接受了团长刚才反复传达完了的任务，马上就要回去准备执行了。但，他很奇怪团长还在想什么呢？在他看来这作战部署，已经是很完善了，而且，他们这个营执行命令也向来是不折不扣保险完成任务的。团长这个人是爱用脑筋的，他还在不放心什么呢？……
    他带着这个小小的疑问，往他们所在的攻击出发点走去。
    （二）
    在他们的攻击点那里，只有王二货这么一家老百姓还在家，他们曾经和所有晋中农民家庭一样，过着这种苦难的日子：
    ……多少人家，家破人亡了！多少肥美的庄稼地，变成荒草场了！这里离太原城只有三十里路，连片的荒草竟长得一人多高，阎匪的“兵农谷一”，把野狼也从山上引下来了。它们白天里躲在荒草地里，晚上便跑到村里嗥嗥叫，要吃人，多怕人呀！可是，就那样，谁家也只得到荒地里去挑沙蓬、挖野菜，回来熬豆饼汤喝，人饿得没力气了，也得到地里去死受，弄个盼头。
    好容易熬到秋天，谷穗黄了，阎匪勾子军又来了，他们想来抢点东西吃，那狼吃人的日子又回来了。
    阎匪军一进门，嘴里说得可好听哩：
    “这回，我们来可改了，我们知道八路军待你们好，这回我们跟他们学，不拿老百姓一针一线，要改得比他们还好。”
    可是，这个说话的官刚走，王二货家里又进一个人，马上翻箱倒柜，女人的水红袜子都要，并且从那柜里翻出了钱来了，拿起来便往口袋里装。
    二货媳妇瞪眼看着只发楞，千辛万苦挣来的几块钱，不由得不令人发急，她皱着眉胆战心惊的说：
    “你们官长不是说不拿老百姓的东西么！？…”
    “你放屁，老子就是官长。”那人把手从口袋里掏出来，手一摆一跺脚就走了。她只好等她男人回来，哭着脸告诉他。
    可是，他男人又有什么办法呢？这两天他到处求爷爷拜奶奶，那个大官的门口都跑到了也不行，人家说：“混蛋，咱们的队伍是‘与民合谋’的，那儿能办出这事情。”他们夫妇俩还敢说什么呢？………这死人世界快过去吧，他们只有盼望解放军快来。……
    （三）
    现在，离开始攻击的时间还有两三个钟头，教导员已走到王二货家里了。王二货正在给战士们烧水喝，二货媳妇正坐在坑上，替战士们缝炸药包，那是马上打仗要用的，外面枪声仍间断的响，二货媳妇不时拍着吓得哭泣的娃娃，一面缝，一面和战士们谈起话来了：
    “今日太阳还没落出，我给勾子军送饭，瞧着他那队伍可稀松哩！”
    “怎么样？”
    马上，她就变着嗓子，学开邢些阎匪士兵的谈话了：
    “一个兵看了看饭说：‘吃这，尽是南瓜玉茭，怎能吃饱？’
    另一个说：‘一个师只剩一个多团了，我看不如投降了好。’
    又一个瞪瞪眼睛：‘哼！你投降！？……’
    ‘咳！咱们为谁干咧！什么时候，咱们帽子一歪，两手把枪这么一举就美了。’
    ‘老乡，能过不能过，就看今天晚上。’
    ‘老乡，看我们今天晚上交枪吧。’”
    “同志们，听到了这位大嫂的话吗？这敌人还不好打吗？”教导员抓紧这个机会，就进行战前动员。
    二货媳妇又补充说：“哎呀，那队伍可不行呀，没有吃的尽偷跑，把我们的粮食都抢吃光了，你们再迟来一天，咱们今年就要饿煞，快解决他们呀！”
    “同志们听到了没有，这是群众的要求，我们的任务很简单，六个大字：‘夺山炮，捉师长’。”
    但是，敌人的师部究竟扎在那个家里呢？这问题在他脑子一闪，使他马上想到在指挥所里沉思的团长，他大概也是在盘算这个吧，那么这个女老乡对敌人这么熟，她可能是知道的，他一问二货媳妇便回答道：
    “哎呀！可是知道，可是知道哩！这几天，遭害得咱们家出了点事，简直跑的恨不得把那个门坎都踢断了。快叫他告你。”
    她用嘴向他男人一指，教导员就派人去请团长，团长马上来了：
    …………
    “那么，你知道敌人的山炮在那里吧？”
    “在师部门口的胡同里。”二货接口回答说。
    “你怎样知道那是山炮呢？”团长有些奇怪了，一个庄稼汉怎么会知道这些呢？
    二货说：“同志，你不知道咱们老百姓盼你们象盼什么似的，早就操上心了，人家告我说是山炮嘛！……”
    “呵！那炮有两个轮轮！”
    “有！一打一蹦，一打一蹦的嘛！”二货学那山炮发射的样子高兴得蹦蹦跳跳的。
    “对！”团长拍拍他的肩膀笑了。
    马上，二货跟着团长出去了，团长又把他的主攻方向告诉二货，问他合适不合适，二货说：从南面攻不好，那里有个水池，还有个坡坡不好上，不如从北面攻那里房子低、是土墙，好爬，敌人又不注意，打他个冷不防。团长针对实际情况，马上把他的主攻方向改过来了。
    　　　　（四）
    几声爆炸，一个猛烈的战斗以后，枪声停止了，天大亮了人们都从他们躲避炮弹的火坑里跳出来，大街上又热闹了。王二货媳妇抱着他的孩子，立在大门口上，不一会，阎匪军的那个师长被押着过来了，她在俘虏人群里看到他丈夫跟上了那个抢他们东西的家伙。后面昨天晚上曾到他们家里的解放军的团长和教导员也慢慢的走过来了。
    团长跟教导员说：“这回打仗，又看到了咱们军事民主的力量了。你说咱们今天这个仗，该叫个啥战？”
    “该叫个啥战？”教导员还没有想好，团长就抢着说：
    “会战！”
    “怎么叫个会战呢？咱们没有用多少人嘛！”团长用手往王二货门上一指说：“你看那里，他们这次不是在配合我们作战吗？我们啥时打的不是这个军与民的大会战！”
    两个人都哈哈大笑了，一起踏进了王二货家的门坎。
