　　Villages like Mujia Ying
  　Plug Breaches and Plant Hyacinth Beans
    [Taihang Telegraph] After successfully plugging the breach in the Xinhe River under the leadership of the government, villagers in more than ten villages, including Mujia Ying in the sixth district of Hui County, have planted a large number of hyacinth beans and peas. Before and after the Lunar New Year, the county government of the county, seeing that the water level of the Xinhe River was gradually receding, organized the masses along the river to go into the water to plug the breach on the fifth day of the first lunar month. In two days, the breach, which was more than seventy feet wide, was plugged, allowing more than 16,800 mu of land to be flooded. Before sowing, many households raised concerns about the difficulty of obtaining grain and seeds. The government immediately provided a loan of 4,200 jin of grain and 5,450 jin of seeds, which was enough to plant 1,100 mu. It also called on the masses to lend to each other. Villages began to rush to plant hyacinth beans and peas on the sixth and seventh days of the first lunar month. In less than half a month, according to statistics from seven villages in the entire district, more than 5,100 mu have been planted. Now, they are continuing to plant early-maturing crops, planting a large number of trees on the river堤, and actively raising sorghum seeds, planning to plant all the flooded land in the third month of the lunar calendar.

　　穆家营等村
  　堵决口种扁豆
    【太行电】辉县六区穆家营等十余村村民，在政府领导下抢堵新河决口后，已大量种植扁豆、豌豆。旧历年前后，该县县政府见新河水势渐落，即在正月初五组织沿河群众下水堵口，两天即将七十余丈宽的缺口堵好，使一万六千八百余亩地先后落水。在下种前，不少户曾提出粮食和种籽困难，政府当即贷粮四千二百斤，及种籽五千四百五十斤，计可种一千一百亩。并号召群众互借，各村在旧历正月初六、七即展开抢种扁豆、豌豆。不到半月，据全区七个村统计，已种了五千一百多亩。现继续种早熟作物，并在河堤上大量栽树和积极筹集高粱种籽，计划在阴历三月，将所有落水地全部种上。
