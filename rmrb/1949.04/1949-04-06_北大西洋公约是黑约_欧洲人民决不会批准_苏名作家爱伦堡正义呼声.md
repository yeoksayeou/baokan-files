Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 4th: According to Agence France-Presse, Moscow: Renowned Soviet writer Ilya Ehrenburg recently published an article in the "Culture and Life" weekly, describing the North Atlantic Treaty as a black pact. Ehrenburg wrote: No matter what those governments do, the people of Europe will never approve this black pact. Parliamentary approval is one thing, the people's approval is another. One can buy an Italian senator, one can intimidate a Danish member of parliament, but the people as a whole will never accept bribes. The people of Europe will never approve this aggressive pact, because they do not want their long-standing culture to be destroyed by the sins of a few thousand merchants who only see war as more business for them. We believe that the people of all countries will know how to safeguard the cause of peace and how to overthrow the imperialists who attempt to dominate the world. War-mongers are indeed issuing orders, but they lack troops because the people refuse to fight. The world is divided into two camps: the creators and the destroyers, the builders and the wreckers, those who defend life and those who support the atomic bomb. France, Italy, and Britain are also divided internally into two camps. The same thing is happening in the United States, where a movement to defend peace is rising.

　　北大西洋公约是黑约  欧洲人民决不会批准
  　苏名作家爱伦堡正义呼声
    【新华社北平四日电】据法新社莫斯科讯：苏联著名作家爱伦堡顷在“文化与生活”周刊上发表论文，将北大西洋公约描述为黑约。爱伦堡写道：无论那些政府怎么样，欧洲的人民是决不会批准这黑约的。议会批准是一会事，人民批准是另一会事。人们可以收买一个意大利的参议员，可以威吓一个丹麦的众议员，但是，全国人民是决不会接受小费的。欧洲的人民决不会批准这个侵略公约，因为他们不愿他们的悠久文化，由于几千个只看到战争是他们更多的生意经的买卖人的罪过而被毁灭。我们相信各国人民会知道如何保障和平事业，如何推翻企图支配世界的帝国主义者。战争贩子固然在发号施令，但是他们缺少军队，因为人民拒绝打仗。世界分为两个阵营：创造者的与毁灭者的，建设者的与破坏者的，保卫生命者者的与支持原子弹的。法国、义大利与英国内部也分为两个阵营。同样的事情也在美国发生，在那里，保卫和平的运动正在兴起。
