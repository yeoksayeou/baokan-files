Qinhuangdao Seaside District
Fisheries, Past and Present

　　The fisheries in the Qinhuangdao Seaside District, after liberation, are gradually recovering with the support of the democratic government. Among the district's 8,003 residents, 433 are engaged in fishing, with 2,165 relying on it for a living, accounting for 37% of the district's population. Last year, the fish production reached 2,526,000 jin, sold in Ping, Tianjin, Tang and other regions.

　　During the Japanese occupation, the fisheries suffered greatly from the oppression and exploitation of the "Fisheries Association." During the Kuomintang rule, the destruction and exploitation of fisheries was even more intensified. In addition to imposing various exorbitant taxes, they used various extortion methods to oppress the fishermen. For example, if fishermen went out to sea to fish at night, they would be arrested under the charge of "night crime" to achieve their extortion goals. Countless enemy and puppet organizations such as "Traffic Police," "Self-Defense Force," "Security Team," "Port Headquarters," and "Police Bureau"... arbitrarily robbed the fishermen's fish. Frequent "gatherings," "indoctrination," and conscription caused the number of fishing boats in the seaside district to decrease from more than 200 to 103, and half of the people who relied on fishing for a living fell into starvation.

　　After the liberation of Qinhuangdao, the fisheries in the seaside district were freed from the shackles imposed by the Kuomintang and, with the support of the democratic government, embarked on the road to recovery. First, they established their own organizations, the "Fishermen's Association" and the "Fishermen's Union," and resolved the relationship between boat owners and fishermen according to the principle of "benefit for both labor and capital." They replaced wages with "profit sharing according to shares" (the number of shares is jointly negotiated by labor and capital, such as "large seine nets" which use "40-60 profit sharing," meaning 40% of the fish price goes to the boat owner and 60% goes to the fishermen). This stimulated the fishermen's interest in increasing production, which benefited both labor and capital. Before liberation, the sale of fish was completely controlled and monopolized by fish merchants, causing the fisheries to suffer a lot of exploitation and affecting sales. Now, it is stipulated that 70% is sold by fish merchants and 30% is sold by peddlers.

　　On February 19th, the district government loaned 88 jin (old scale) of yarn for weaving nets, with 28 fishing households receiving from 1 to 8 jin each. The Qinhuangdao People's Bank also loaned 10,000 yuan in Renminbi and 22 bundles of yarn (8 or 9 jin per bundle) to support the unemployed fishermen in the district. In addition, women were mobilized to weave nets with the loaned yarn. For example, in Chitu Mountain Village, the number of women who could weave nets has increased from 30 to 125. According to the Fishermen's Association's March statistics, the district added a total of 10,523 various fishing nets, an increase of 40% compared to last year. Fishermen used the loans to add eight sampan boats. For example, six fishermen from Caochang received a loan of 4,500 yuan. They divided into two groups, bought boats, and wove nets, and happily said: "After working for others for so many years, today we finally have our own boats." Lu Zhuang's Pan Yongren and Li Jinsheng were on the verge of being unable to fish, but this time they received loans, eliminating the threat of unemployment.

### 秦皇岛海滨区　渔业今昔

　　秦皇岛海滨区
  　渔业今昔
    解放后的秦皇岛海滨区渔业，在民主政府的扶助下，逐渐走向复兴。该区八千零三口人中有四百三十三人经营渔业，赖以为生的有二千一百六十五人，占全区人口百分之三十七，去年产鱼达二百五十二万六千斤，销售于平、津、唐各地。
    在日寇占领时期，渔业倍受“渔业组合”压榨剥削之苦，在国民党统治时期，他们对于渔业的摧残、压榨更是变本加厉，除课以各种苛捐杂税外，更用各种敲诈手段来欺压渔民。如渔民夜间下海捕鱼，则按“犯夜”罪名加以逮捕，以达到他们勒索的目的；“交警”、“自卫队”、“保安队”、“港口司令部”、“警察局”……等无数敌伪机关随便抢走渔民的鱼；三天两头的“集合”、“训话”、抓壮丁，使得海滨区的渔船由二百数十只减至一百零三只，赖以为生的人民二分之一陷于饥饿苦境。
    秦皇岛解放后，海滨区的渔业摆脱了国民党所给的枷锁，并在民主政府的扶植下，走上复兴的道路，首先成立了自己的组织“渔会”及“渔工会”，按着“劳资两利”的原则解决了船主与渔工间的关系，用“按份分红”的办法代替工资（份数多少由劳资双方共同商议，如“大挂子网”则按“四六分红”，即鱼价的四成归船主，六成归渔工），这样刺激了渔民增产兴趣，对于劳资双方都有好处。鱼产的销售解放前完全由鱼商控制垄断，使渔业受到很多剥削，并且影响销路，现在则规定七成由鱼商销售，三成由小贩去卖。
    二月十九日区政府贷出织网洋线八十八斤（老秤），二十八家渔户各得一斤至八斤不等。秦市人民银行也贷出人民币一万元及洋线二十二捆（每捆八、九斤）扶植该区失业渔工。此外并发动妇女用所贷得之线织网，如赤土山庄从前只有三十名妇女会织网，现在则增至一百二十五名。据渔会三月份统计，全区添了各种鱼网共一万零五百二十三件，比去年增多了百分之四十；渔民们利用贷款添置八艘舢板船。如草厂六个渔工得到四千五百元的贷款，他们分成两组，买了船，织了网，高兴的说：“扛活多年今天自己也有船了。”陆庄潘永仁、李金生两家眼看无力打渔了，这回得了贷款，免去了失业的威胁。　　　　（冀东分社）
