On August 3, the Potsdam Conference Communiqué was issued, which stipulated in detail the principles of the Soviet, American, and British countries jointly establishing a Council of Foreign Ministers, dealing with the German issue, and dealing with the control of Italy, Austria, Poland, Romania, Bulgaria, and Hungary.

　　"Holy Alliance"—On September 26, 1815, three European feudal ruling countries, Russia, Prussia, and Austria, signed an alliance treaty under the instigation of the Russian Emperor Alexander I and the Austrian Prime Minister Metternich. This treaty was disguised as a religious alliance but was actually aimed at military aggression and interference in the revolutions of various countries (bourgeois revolutions) to maintain reactionary feudal rule. This treaty was shamelessly called the "Holy Alliance" by the reactionary rulers at the time.
