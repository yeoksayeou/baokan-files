　　How to Improve Technology to Increase Agricultural Production
　　Jizhong Administrative Office Agriculture Department
　　Increasing the production of grain, cotton, and oil crops is the main task of agricultural production this year. In this year's great production movement, in addition to widely organizing the masses to implement labor exchange, we must also promote the improvement of agricultural technology. These two things are indispensable conditions for achieving increased production. Every rural work cadre should regard leading and organizing this movement as an important and regular task.
　　What things should we start with to improve technology?
　　　　Improving Seeds
　　At present, the crops sown by the masses are very mixed. In one field, some stalks are tall, some are short, some ripen early, and some ripen late, which is very uneven and makes harvesting difficult. This is a major reason for reduced yields. Therefore, promoting seed selection, discovering good seeds from farmers, and organizing farmers to exchange seeds are the first and most important things to improve agricultural production technology. Our farm has few improved varieties tested by scientific methods. Now, the main thing is to encourage the masses to select seeds in the fields. When selecting, choose those with high yield, good quality, early maturity, strong resistance to wind, rain, drought, diseases, and insects, even maturity, and uniform shape. Good crops can also be organized for seed exchange. This year, we should vigorously promote seed selection and organize the masses to exchange seeds with each other during the wheat harvest and the autumn harvest.
　　　　Preventing and Controlling Diseases and Pests
　　In recent years, crops have been affected by diseases and insects every year. The common ones are smut of millet, sorghum, wheat, and corn; head smut of millet (also called white hair disease or gun barrel); and wheat nematode disease (also called wheat cockle or flaxseed). In terms of insects, there are mole crickets, aphids, red spiders, ＠ insects, locusts, ② grubs, corn borers, and fruit tree psyllids and pear bugs. Many places suffered from these pests last year. If we do not find ways to prevent and control these disasters, crop yields will not be guaranteed. According to our current conditions, it is difficult to treat disasters once they occur. Therefore, strengthening prevention is the most important method. The secret to prevention is: more plowing and weeding, crop rotation, and enhanced resistance. For smut of millet and sorghum and head smut of millet, we must also universally promote seed soaking (two parts boiling water and one part cold water to make warm water, the water should be more than twice the amount of seeds, soak the seeds for five minutes, take them out and cool them). In areas with wheat cockle disease, promote the use of salt water to remove seeds, and float away the diseased grains (one part salt to ten parts water), and immediately remove any diseased plants. If pests are found, eliminate them immediately and do not neglect them.
　　　　Improving Farming Methods and Farm Tools
　　At present, plowing and weeding are generally rough and shallow, which not only hinders the development of seedlings but also often causes diseases and pests. Because there is a shortage of people and livestock, especially some women and children who are not skilled in techniques, we must find ways to organize experienced elderly people to teach them more. In addition, we should also pay attention to the more advanced farm tools used by the masses and introduce them widely. For example, in Xian County, plowing the land without using a "gai" (farm tool) to smooth it has been successful, and a certain farm in Jizhong has transformed the stone roller. Of course, we must also understand local soil habits and not blindly copy the experience of other regions. In the past, some cadres in the Tenth District of Jizhong believed that the local method of sowing on large ridges was backward and insisted on promoting narrow drills, but in fact, sowing on large ridges is more scientific in fertile land.
　　Farms should take the lead in the improvement of technology. At present, farms are generally equipped with experimental fields, specializing in experiments on various improved varieties and prevention and control of diseases and pests; and breeding farms, where all the seeds successfully tested in the experimental fields are initially propagated; and they are responsible for leading the county extension stations to carry out extension work. In villages, we must rely on and organize production heroes and models, local experts, and enthusiastic farmers to form village technology research groups to promote farmers to improve their technology. In many places in the Taihang and Jinnan areas, this method has been used to improve technology, and it has played a significant role. This is the best way to rely on the masses to carry out work.
　　However, the promotion and introduction of technology must be based on full confidence and evidence, and some must be scientifically researched and experimented before they can be promoted or introduced lightly. For example, last year a newspaper in Jizhong introduced that one jin of black oil fertilizer and two sheng of sorghum could replace two carts of manure. Many farmers used this method of fertilization, but it burned the wheat seedlings. This is worth noting.
　　　　"If the solar terms are wrong, the whole year is wasted"
　　In addition, the seasonality of agriculture has a decisive effect on technology. "If the solar terms are wrong, the whole year is wasted." Therefore, in studying farming technology, it is very important to pay attention to mastering the seasons and climate, otherwise the production increase plan will fail.

### 如何改良技术增加农产

　　如何改良技术增加农产
    冀中行署农业处
    增产粮食、棉花、油料，是今年农业生产的主要任务。今年的大生产运动中，除了广泛的组织群众实行拨工换工以外，还必须提倡改良农业技术，这两件事情，是达到增产不可缺一的条件。我们每个农村工作的干部，应将领导与组织这一运动当作重要与经常的任务。
    改良技术要从那些事情入手呢？
    　　　　改良种籽
    现在群众中的庄稼种，非常杂乱，一块地里的庄稼有秸高、秸低，有勤有晚，很不齐楚，在收割时左右为难。这是减少收成的很大原因。因此提倡选种、和发现农民的好种、组织农民换种，是改良农业生产技术第一重要的事情。咱们农场用科学方法试验的良种现在还少，现在主要是提倡群众在田里进行选种，选时要选产量大、品质好、熟的早、抵抗风、雨、旱、病、虫力强、熟的齐、长的形状一样的。庄稼长的好的，还可组织换种。咱们今年应当在麦熟在大秋都要大量提倡选种，并组织群众相互换种。
    　　　　防除病害虫害
    这几年的庄稼年年发生病虫，常见的是谷子、高梁、小麦、棒子的黑疸，谷的看谷老（白发病也叫枪杆），小麦的线虫病（也叫麦莠子马莲子）都不少。在虫子方面蛄蝼、蚜虫、火蜘蛛、＠虫、蚂蚱、②螬、钻心虫，果木树的步曲、梨狗子等。去年不少地方发生这种虫害，如果我们不想法防除这些灾害，庄稼就没保障。按我们现时条件，灾害如发生除治就有许多困难。因此，加强预防是最要紧的办法。预防的妙诀就是：多耕多锄，换种倒茬，增强抵抗能力。对于谷子、高梁的黑疸和谷的白发病，还要普遍的提倡浸种（两份开水一份凉水对成温水，水要多于种子的一倍，把种子浸入五分钟，捞出凉干）。有麦莠子病的地方，提倡用盐水捞种，把病粒漂去（一份盐十分水），发现病棵立即拔去。发现害虫马上消除不能疏忽。
    　　　　改良耕作法和农具
    现在耕地锄地一般是又粗又浅，不但幼苗发育不好，还常常好闹病闹虫。因现在人缺牲口少，尤其一些妇女儿童技术不熟练，因此必须设法组织有经验的老年人多教他们。另外还应当注意群众中有那些比较进步的农具，进行广泛介绍。例如：献县耕地不使盖（农具）擦平，冀中某农场改造砘子，都有一定成绩。当然还要了解当地土质习惯，不能硬搬其他地区经验。以往有的干部在冀中十分区认为当地耩大垄是落后，硬提倡窄耧，实际壮地耩大垄是比较合乎科学的。
    技术的改良，农场应首先负起这个责任。现在农场的设置一般是有试验场，专作各种优良品种和防除病虫害的试验；有繁殖场，凡试验场试验成功的种籽都先由他们初步繁殖；并由他们负责领导县推广场，进行推广工作。在村中必须依靠与组织农民当中的生产英雄模范、土专家、热心生产的农民，组成村技术研究小组，推动农民提高技术。太行区、冀南区，不少地方都是利用这个方法来改进技术的，起的作用很大，这是依靠群众开展工作最好的办法。
    不过对于技术的提倡和介绍，要有充分的把握和根据，有些要经过科学的研究和实验，不能轻易提倡或介绍。如去年冀中某报介绍一斤黑油二升高梁能顶两车粪，不少农民用这法施肥，结果烧了麦芽。这是值得注意的。
    　　　　“节气一错一年白过”
    此外农业上的季节性，对技术是有决定作用的。“节气一错，一年白过”，因此在研究农作技术中，注意掌握季节与气候是十分重要的，否则增产计划必将落空。
