　　Prevent Traffic Accidents!
    Our Reporter

    It has been two months since Beiping's liberation, and the chaotic traffic situation of the past has gradually improved. However, there are still some undesirable phenomena that should be quickly corrected. For example, cars speeding or overtaking recklessly, pedicabs randomly driving side by side on the road, passengers waiting for streetcars crowding disorderly in the middle of the road, vendors occupying the entire sidewalk in some places, even extending their stalls onto the road; pedestrians often walking on the slow lanes on both sides of the road, forcing slow vehicles into the fast lanes in the center of the road. As a result, traffic accidents frequently occur. In the twenty-eight days of February alone, streetcars were involved in twenty-nine accidents. From March 1st to 19th, there were twenty major traffic accidents (causing injury or vehicle damage) in the city. Although this number is much lower than before Beiping's liberation, the issue of establishing good traffic order and ensuring pedestrian safety still requires serious attention.

    According to statistics from the People's Municipal Government Public Works Bureau, there are now a total of 3,038 cars in the city, more than double the 1,119 in 1947. There are 24,426 pedicabs, an increase of more than 5,000 from the 18,975 in 1947. There are 177,496 bicycles, an increase of 36,000 from the 141,743 in 1947 (the above figures do not include military vehicles and some unregistered vehicles). These vehicles operating within the forty square li area of Beiping, with its two million people, would not cause chaos if traffic control were better. So, why are these traffic accidents happening? According to information gathered by our reporter from the Garrison Command, Public Security Bureau, streetcar company, traffic police, car drivers, and pedicab drivers, the reasons are approximately as follows: (1) Many car drivers lack sufficient political education. Some military vehicle drivers are careless while driving and do not obey traffic commands. Some newly liberated military vehicle drivers have not completely abandoned their bad habits of disregarding everything during the Kuomintang rule. A small number of drivers who recently entered the city after liberation are still unclear about the city's traffic regulations and geography, making accidents more likely to occur. (2) Some pedicab drivers misunderstand the meaning of liberation, thinking that since Beiping has been liberated, cars dare not hit them and the police cannot manage them, so they drive in the middle of the road and do not avoid cars. (3) Some citizens do not obey the commands of traffic police. Vendors set up stalls on the road and do not listen to restraints. (4) Some traffic police are lax and absent from their posts, and dare not actively direct military vehicles. (5) In some crucial locations, traffic signs are lacking. (6) Streetcar passengers sometimes exceed the limit, and drivers are squeezed and cannot drive freely. (7) After liberation, vehicles from various places come and go frequently, and some have not obtained license plates. If they flee after causing an accident, there is no way to investigate, reducing the driver's sense of responsibility. (8) There are too many types of vehicles, and the speed differences are too great, requiring faster vehicles to overtake. (9) Some commercial vehicles, in order to make money, put poorly equipped cars on the road for business. (10) Many pedicabs and bicycles have inadequate control equipment (brakes). (11) Some main streets have potholes, causing both fast and slow vehicles to crowd onto the flat road in the middle. (12) Some vehicles do not turn on their lights when driving at night.

    In response to these reasons, and based on the opinions of various parties, our reporter has summarized the following points for the reference of relevant departments: (1) Strengthen education for traffic police, car and streetcar drivers, pedicab drivers, bicycle riders, cart drivers, and the general public, so that they recognize that strictly enforcing traffic order is an extremely important measure to promote urban prosperity, increase efficiency, and ensure the safety of pedestrians. Traffic police should be conscientious and responsible and not leave their posts without authorization, and their commands must be clear. When all types of vehicles pass through intersections, they should proceed according to traffic rules. When traffic lights malfunction, accidents are especially likely to occur due to misjudgment of targets by vehicles, horses, and pedestrians, and traffic police should pay special attention. Car drivers must not exceed the prescribed speed, and when overtaking a vehicle in front, they should first honk to warn and maintain a certain distance, overtaking from the left. When entering an intersection, they should pay attention to the traffic lights, honk and slow down, and stop immediately to check after causing an accident, and should not flee to avoid punishment. Streetcar drivers should strictly abide by traffic regulations, and when passing through intersections and bustling areas, they should pay attention to looking up at the wires, down at the road, and left and right at pedestrians, and when passing another streetcar, they should tightly brake and ring the bell to prevent pedestrians and vehicles from crossing the tracks. Pedicabs, rickshaws, bicycles, and carts should travel on the right side of the road and should not proceed side by side in the middle of the road. Pedestrians must walk on the sidewalks, and when crossing the road, they must follow the crosswalk lines. (2) Relevant agencies should form a unified traffic management organization, solicit opinions from all parties, formulate practical traffic regulations, strengthen publicity, and thoroughly implement them. Those who violate the regulations should be advised or punished. (3) Expedite the registration of various vehicles and issue license plates. (4) Strengthen the sense of responsibility and authority of traffic police, and handle all vehicles according to the law. (5) Regularly inspect the control equipment of vehicles, strictly examine car drivers, and also conduct tests when pedicab drivers obtain licenses. (6) Streetcar mechanisms are not as agile as cars, and cars must change direction at least ten meters away when overtaking a streetcar. When driving parallel to a streetcar, a one-meter gap should be maintained. (7) Regulate vendors, so that they are neatly arranged, and floating stalls should be absolutely prohibited on the road. Large items should not be piled in front of stores. (8) Plan and designate parking areas, and empty vehicles should not wander on the road. Pedicabs and rickshaws should not be parked near streetcar stations. Streetcar passengers should line up in a place that does not obstruct traffic and board the streetcar in an orderly manner. (9) The driver's area of the streetcar should be separated from the passenger compartment. (10) Build more traffic police booths, repair roads, and organize traffic signs and red and green traffic lights. (11) Add more traffic police to crucial streets (the Xianyu Kou to Zhushikou street is bustling and the traffic is chaotic, but there are no traffic police).

　　防止车祸！
    本报记者
    北平解放已经两月，过去那种交通混乱的情形，已经逐渐改善了。但是，还有一些不良的现象，应该迅速纠正。例如汽车超速度地急驰或超越行驶，三轮车在马路上随意并行前进，等候电车的乘客散乱的聚集在马路中心，有些地方摊贩将人行道全部侵占，甚至一直摆到马路上；行人多走马路两侧的慢车道，慢车被挤入马路中央的快车道，因此，车祸就常常发生了。在二月里的二十八天中，仅电车就发生车祸二十九次，三月一日至十九日，全市发生较大车祸（伤人或毁车）达二十起，这个数字虽比北平解放前减少了许多许多，但是，建立良好的交通秩序，保证行人的安全，这个问题还是应该十分注意的。
    据人民市政府公用局统计，现在全市汽车共三○三八辆，比民国三十六年的一一一九辆增加了一倍多，三轮车二四四二六辆，比三十六年的一八九七五辆增了五千多辆，自行车一七七四九六辆，比三十六年的一四一七四三辆增加了三万六千辆（以上数字不包括军车和若干尚未登记的车辆）。这些车辆放在四十里方圆、二百万人口的北平城内，假如对交通管制得更好一些，是不致发生混乱现象的。那么，这些车祸为什么发生的呢？据记者从警备司令部、公安局、电车公司、交通警察、汽车司机、三轮车夫等各方面了解，约有以下这些原因：（一）许多汽车司机的政治教育不够，某些军车司机开车时漫不经心，且有不服从交通指挥的现象。有些新解放的军车司机，在国民党统治时期不管一切的恶习，尚未完全改掉。极少数解放后新入城的司机，还不明了城内交通规章和城内各处的地理，以致较易发生车祸。（二）有些三轮车夫误解了解放的意义，以为北平既已解放，汽车不敢碰，警察不能管，因而走到马路中央，不躲汽车。（三）有些市民行动，不服从交通警察指挥。摊贩把小摊摆到马路上，也不听约束。（四）若干交通警察情绪旷勤空岗，不敢积极指挥军车。（五）个别冲要地方，交通标帜缺乏。（六）电车乘客有时逾额，司机被挤得不能自由开车。（七）解放后各地车辆往来频繁，有的未领牌照号码，肇祸后如果逃逸，便无从查缉，司机减少了责任感。（八）车辆种类过多，速度相差悬殊，快车必须超越行驶。（九）一部分商车为了赚钱，把设备不全的汽车也开出营业。（十）不少三轮车、自行车控制设备（闸）不够。（十一）有些大街道路坑坎，快车、慢车都挤在中间的平坦道上行驶。（十二）有些车辆夜间行驶不燃灯。
    针对以上这些原因，根据各方面提出的意见，记者谨综合成下列数端，提供有关方面参考：（一）对交通警察、汽车电车司机、三轮车夫、自行车骑用者、大车夫和一般市民加强教育，使他们认识严肃交通秩序，是繁荣城市，加强效率，保障路人安全的极重要的措施。交通警察要认真负责不得擅离岗位，指挥必须明确。各型车辆通过街口时，应按交通规则放车。在红绿灯失灵时，车马行人，因错视目标，尤易发生事故，交通警察应特别注意。汽车司机开车不得超过规定速度，超越前车时，应先鸣笛警告，并保持一定距离，自左侧抢行。入街口应注意指挥灯，鸣笛缓行，肇事后立即停车查看，不应畏罪潜逃。电车司机应切实遵守交通规章，行经交叉路口及繁华地带时，应注意抬头看线，低头看道，左右看行人，错车时应紧闸踏铃，以防行人车辆横穿轨道。三轮车、人力车、自行车、大车应行走马路右侧，不得在马路中心并列前进。行人必须走便道，横穿马路，要按照横穿道线行走。（二）由有关机关组成统一整理交通机构，征询各方意见，订定切合实际的交通规章，加强宣传彻底执行。违反规章者劝告或处罚。（三）速办各种车辆登记，颁发牌照。（四）加强交通警察责任心和权限，对任何车辆，均应依法处理。（五）随时检查车辆之控制设备，严格考试汽车司机，三轮车夫领牌照时也应加以试验。（六）电车机件不若汽车灵敏，汽车超越电车时须在十公尺以外，再变换方向。与电车并行，应保持一公尺间隔。（七）整理摊贩，使整齐排列，马路上绝对禁摆浮摊，各商店门前不得堆置大件货物。（八）规划指定停车处，空车不得在马路上徘徊，电车站附近禁止停放三轮车、人力车。电车乘客应在不妨害交通地点，排队等候，鱼贯上车。（九）电车司机开车处应与乘客车厢隔开。（十）多修交通警岗台，整修马路，整理交通标帜及红绿指挥灯。（十一）冲要街道多设交通警（鲜鱼口至珠市口街道繁华，车辆混乱，却无一交通警察）。
