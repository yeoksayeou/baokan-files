　　Cultivating a New Labor Attitude
　　By Beza Bazong, translated by Totov
　　For many years, the Hungarian working class was suppressed under the yoke of capitalist exploitation. Manufacturers and industrialists enriched themselves at the expense of labor. Therefore, workers did not feel interested in the success of production.

　　After our country declared itself a democratic republic, the Communist Party faced the important task of developing a new labor attitude among workers and making them interested in performing their duties in factories.

　　When the state took over the Weiss Manfred Factory in December 1946, the Communist Party members in this factory immediately organized talks and meetings to explain the need for a new production attitude.

　　We made the following explanation: Up until now, capitalists have become rich through your labor. But now there are no capitalists. You are working for yourselves and your country. By consciously working under the current conditions, you are strengthening the country's economic power while also improving your living standards. Our party organization popularized Comrade Rákosi's earlier slogan: "It is your country—build it!" Hundreds of propagandists engaged in political work in the factory's workshops. A large amount of material on this kind of topic was published in our widely circulated newspapers, in the "Wing" publications, and on wall newspapers.

　　In March of last year (1947), the factory was nationalized. A former worker was appointed as the factory director. The party organization mobilized all party members and trade union members to implement the production plan as prescribed and launched a labor competition. It must be pointed out that even before nationalization, the labor competition had already begun.

　　Many workers exceeded their production targets and competed with each other. The success of the most advanced workers clearly showed that the time was ripe to organize labor competitions in the factory.

　　The next task was to develop this competition on a mass scale. In practice, our party organization encountered many difficulties. For example, some workers believed that if they exceeded their targets, they would not receive extra compensation. To refute this point, we convened a meeting of Communist Party member workers and decided to start a labor competition among themselves. Soon after, they achieved great victories. Propagandists announced these victories at party and trade union meetings and in the factory newspaper, pointing out how much each comrade had exceeded the target and how much extra income they had earned.

　　The Party and Trade Union Committees called on workers to emulate their example, and immediately one hundred and twenty workshops responded.

　　The factory was the initiator of the national labor competition. And party members were the driving force of the competition. For example, lathe operator Antal exceeded the standard by 160 to 170 percent, grinder Janos exceeded by 180 percent, and engineer Florian exceeded the bonus standard by 165 to 170 percent. These workers are examples for the remaining workers to strive for in order to achieve the next three-year plan.

　　The labor competition has helped improve the work of the enterprise. Before nationalization, the factory was losing money. However, in April of this year (1948), it earned a profit of 300,000 pengős, and in May and June it reached 9 million. Output is increasing monthly. The first year's plan was completed on June 26, which means it was completed 35 days ahead of schedule.

　　Labor productivity per hour has increased by 50 percent. Wages have also increased accordingly. For example, a worker who completed 107 percent of the plan in January had an average weekly wage of 137.28 pengős. When a worker exceeded the target by 131 percent in June, his average weekly wage was 174.72 pengős. The factory's average weekly wage in January was 143 pengős, and by June it was 164.44 pengős.

　　While we encourage labor competition as the main method of inducing a new labor attitude, we have not forgotten other tasks in this regard. A conscious attitude towards work is not only reflected in high labor productivity.

　　The Party emphasizes the need for high discipline among workers, the need to use equipment and raw materials carefully; we are training workers in the spirit of complete production procedures, which in turn promotes the growth of labor productivity.

　　Our propagandists have done a lot of work in this area, explaining the harmful results of lateness and absenteeism, and calling on workers to maximize production during the work day. This has promoted discipline, and as a result, there are now few instances of lateness and absenteeism at the factory. Workers are enthusiastic about labor competition and have applied it to their work, fully aware of their responsibilities.

　　养成新的劳动态度
    ＢｅｚａＢａｚｏｎｇ作托夫译
    许多年来，匈牙利的工人阶级是被压制在资本主义剥削的拘轭之下。制造家及工业家以劳工为牺牲而致富。所以工人对于生产的成功并未感到兴趣。
    当我们国家宣布为民主共和国之后，共产党乃面临着使工人发展着新的劳动态度的，并使他们在工厂执行职务感到兴趣的重要任务。
    当国家于一九四六年十二月接管威斯·曼富利特工厂时，在此工厂中的共产党员立即组织会谈和会议，解释着新的生产态度之需要。
    我们作着如下的解释。迄今以前资本家是靠着你们的劳动致富。但现在没有资本家了。你们是为着你们自己及你们的国家而工作。在现在条件下自觉地工作，你们是加强着国家的经济力量，同时又是改进着你们的生活标准。我们党的组织通俗化了拉科西同志早先所提出的口号：“它是你们的国家——建设它！”数百位宣传员在该工厂的工场中从事政治工作。在我们广泛流行的报纸上，在“翼”刊物上及墙报上大量公布关于这类的材料。
    去年三月间（一九四七年），这工厂国有化了。一位以前的工人被指定为厂长。党的组织动员了一切党员及职工会员按规定实施生产计划，并发动劳动竞赛。这里必须指出甚至它在国有化之前，劳动竞赛早已开始了。
    许多工人都突破了他们的生产目标，并互相比赛。最先进工人的成功，显明地表示着在工厂中组织劳动竞赛的时机已经成熟。
    接着的任务则是将这种竞赛发展为群众的规模。在实行时我们党的组织曾遭遇着不少困难。例如，某些工人都这样相信着，以为超过目标，他们将不会获得额外的报酬。为着反证这点，我们召开了一次共产党员工人的会议，决定在他们自己之间开始劳动竞赛。不久之后，他们达到巨大的胜利。宣传员在党及职工会会议上及在工厂报上公布这些胜利，指明着每个同志超过目标几何以及额外收入几何。
    党及职工会委员会号召工人效仿他们的前例，立即有一百二十个工场响应。
    该工厂是全国劳动竞赛的创始者。而党员则是竞赛的推动力。象旋盘工人安特尔超过标准的百分之一百六十至一百七十，磨工杨诺斯竟超过百分之一百八十，而工程师富罗利安奖金标准的百分之一百六十五至一百七十。这些工人是其余工人为实现今后三年计划而斗争的榜样。
    劳动竞赛曾起着改进企业工作的帮助作用。在国有化之前，该厂是亏本的。然而，今年四月间（一九四八年），它曾获得三十万保币的利润，在五月和六月竟达到九百万。产量是每月增长着。六月二十六即已完成了第一年计划，就是说提前了三十五天。
    每小时的劳动生产性已上升了百分之五十。工资也同样地增加着。例如，一位工人在正月份完成了计划的百分之一百零七，每周平均工资是一百三十七点二八保币。当一位工人于六月份超过目标的百分之一百三十一，则他每周平均工资是一百七十四点七二保币。该工厂正月他的每周平均工资是一百四十三保币，至六月则是一百六十四点四四保币。
    当着我们将鼓励劳动竞赛当作诱导新劳动态度的主要方法的时候，我们未曾忘记了在这方面的其他任务。对工作自觉的态度不仅是反映在高度劳动生产性上面。
    党强调着工人高度纪律的需要，需要谨慎地使用设备和原料；我们正在以完整的生产程序的精神去训练工人，此反又促进劳动生产性的增长。
    我们宣传员在这方面已经做了许多工作，他们解释着迟到和不上工的损害结果，并号召工人从工作日中使出产达到最高限度。这样促进了纪律性，其结果是该工厂现在很少发生迟到和不上工的现象。工人都热心劳动竞赛，并自己将已运用于工作中，完全自觉及他们的责任。
