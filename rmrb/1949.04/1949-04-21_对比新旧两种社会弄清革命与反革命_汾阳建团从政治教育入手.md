　　Contrasting the New and Old Societies to Clarify Revolution and Counter-Revolution
　　Fenyang Builds the Youth League by Starting with Political Education
[Jinzhong Electric] In Fenyang City, 113 young men and women had joined the New Democratic Youth League by March. The establishment of the League began with political education, starting with the Kunlun Match Factory and Fenyang Middle School. Initially, some young people at the Kunlun Match Factory held skeptical and wait-and-see attitudes toward the Youth League. The factory branch, through Party members, explained the purpose of building the League to the young workers, conducted discussions contrasting the new and old societies, and enlightened the class consciousness of the young workers. On the spot, more than 30 young workers applied to join the League. Students in various schools had long been subjected to the enslaving education of the Japanese invaders and Yan bandits, and could not distinguish between the New Democratic Youth League and the enemy's reactionary organizations – the "Three People's Principles Youth League" and the "Comrades Association." The County Youth Committee used methods such as lectures and organized discussions to enable the youth to strictly distinguish between revolutionary and counter-revolutionary organizations in essence, providing education on the future and enlightening ideological awareness. On March 27th, more than 70 young people from various agencies, factories, and schools in the city held a grand ceremony to join the League. More than 600 students automatically attended as observers, expanding the influence of the Youth League among the masses. However, individual departments and districts/villages exhibited the phenomenon of "forced conscription," simply pursuing the number of League members and abandoning ideological education. For example, some used voting elections, and some organized groups according to age. The County Youth Committee decided to stop it immediately and emphasized re-education, review, and approval, so that people could become formal League members.

　　对比新旧两种社会弄清革命与反革命
  　汾阳建团从政治教育入手
    【晋中电】汾阳城三月份已有男女青年一百一十三人参加新民主主义青年团。建团是从政治教育着手的。并从昆仑火柴厂与汾阳中学开始。开头昆仑火柴厂有些青年对青年团存着怀疑观望态度，工厂支部通过党员向青年工人讲解建团目的，并对比新旧社会，进行座谈，启发青年工人的阶级觉悟后，当场即有三十余青年工人申请入团。各校学生过去长期受日寇、阎匪的奴化教育，弄不清新民主主义青年团与敌人的反动组织——“三青团”、“同志会”的区别。县青委会即以上课讲解、组织讨论等方式，使青年在思想上将革命与反革命的组织从本质上严格区别开来，给以前途教育，启发思想觉悟。三月二十七日，全城各机关、工厂、学校七十余青年举行了盛大的入团仪式，自动列席学生达六百余人，扩大了青年团在群众中的影响。但个别部门及区村存在着单纯追求团员数目，放弃思想教育的“拉夫”现象。如有的用投票选举，有的按年龄编团等。县青委决定立即停止，重新教育、审查、批准，才能成为正式团员。
