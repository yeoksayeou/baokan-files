Editor's Note: As the delegation from the reactionary and traitorous Kuomintang government in Nanjing comes to Beijing for peace talks with the Communist Party of China, the most pressing issue on the minds of the people across the nation is how the Kuomintang government and its representatives will address the question of responsibility for the war. Although the Li Zongren-He Yingqin government in Nanjing claims to be willing to use the CPC's eight-point peace proposal as the basis for negotiations, in reality, it has yet to sever ties with the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary clique and the U.S. imperialist government, continuing to serve as a tool for their counter-revolutionary activities. This is, of course, completely incompatible with the path to true peace as outlined in the CPC's eight-point proposal. The reactionary and traitorous Kuomintang government in Nanjing is clearly unwilling to acknowledge its full responsibility for launching the war against the people. To help the people across the nation understand the systematic evidence regarding the responsibility for the war, and to help the reactionary and traitorous Kuomintang government recall the undeniable and heinous crimes of itself and its master, the U.S. imperialist government, our agency has compiled the following chronology of major events in China from the time of Japan's surrender to the present (August 1945 to March 1949). By examining these concrete facts, the people will be able to judge the true value of the Kuomintang government's and U.S. imperialism's flowery rhetoric; and those who attempt to evade and conceal their own and their master's crimes will be exposed.

**1945**

August 8: The Soviet Union declares war on Japan. The Soviet Army enters the Northeast, annihilating the main force of the Japanese Army, capturing 510,000 Japanese soldiers, and decisively contributing to Japan's collapse and surrender. August 9: Chairman Mao Zedong of the CPC issues a statement: "With the Soviet Union's action, the time has come to finally defeat the Japanese invaders and all their lackeys. The Eighth Route Army, New Fourth Army, and other people's forces should, under all possible conditions, launch a broad offensive against all unwilling-to-surrender invaders and their lackeys, annihilating their combat forces, seizing their weapons and resources, and rapidly expanding the liberated areas while reducing the occupied areas. ... The people of the entire nation must be vigilant against the danger of civil war and strive to establish a democratic coalition government."

August 10: The Japanese government announces its intention to surrender. On the same day, General Zhu De, Commander-in-Chief of the People's Liberation Army, orders the forces in North China, Central China, and South China to advance rapidly to disarm the enemy and accept the surrender of Japanese troops, and orders the forces that had been fighting against the Japanese in the Suizhong-Liaoning border area to advance quickly into the Northeast to cooperate with the Soviet Army in recovering the entire Northeast. August 11: The traitorous Kuomintang government's Chairman, Chiang Kai-shek, issues an order to General Zhu De: "All units under your command should stay in place and await further orders," and not to take any unilateral actions against the enemy. He also orders the puppet army to "maintain order" and resist the People's Liberation Army's acceptance of surrender. Note: At this time, the People's Liberation Army was fighting against 69% of the Japanese invaders and 95% of the puppet army. Most cities in North China, Central China, and South China were long surrounded by the People's Liberation Army, while the majority of the Kuomintang's passive anti-Japanese army was hiding in the southwestern and northwestern parts of China, preparing for a civil war against the people. Chiang Kai-shek's absurd order shows that the Kuomintang reactionaries are determined to seize the fruits of the Chinese people's eight years of struggle, returning China to the dark semi-feudal, semi-colonial state that existed before the war of resistance against Japan.

August 13: General Zhu De and Vice Commander Peng Dehuai of the People's Liberation Army send a telegram to Chiang Kai-shek, firmly rejecting his order of the 11th: "Because your order to us is not only unfair but also contrary to the national interests of the Chinese people, it only benefits the Japanese invaders and the traitors who betrayed their country." The People's Liberation Army continues to launch resolute attacks on the Japanese and traitors, thereby recovering vast territories and many cities. However, the reactionary Kuomintang government orders its army to "recover lost territory" from the People's Liberation Army.

August 14: The Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance is signed. The treaty stipulates that the Soviet Army will enter the Northeast to disarm the Japanese army and cooperate with the Chinese army until final victory is achieved. The treaty also stipulates that after the end of hostilities against Japan, neither country shall conclude a separate peace treaty with the Japanese government, and both must take all measures to prevent Japan from resuming aggression and disrupting peace. To jointly defend against aggression in the Far East, the annex to the treaty stipulates that the two countries will jointly use the naval base in Lushun, and during the war against Japan, Dalian will also be included within the scope of this base. This treaty plays a significant role in the annihilation of the Japanese Kwantung Army and the maintenance of peace in the Far East. On the same day, the Japanese Emperor formally accepts unconditional surrender.

August 15: General Zhu De of the People's Liberation Army sends a letter to the ambassadors of the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union in China, stating: (1) The Kuomintang government and its command cannot represent the liberated areas of China, the broad masses of the occupied areas, and all genuine anti-Japanese armed forces. If any agreements or treaties concerning the liberated areas of China, the occupied areas, and all genuine anti-Japanese armed forces are made without our prior consent, we reserve the right to speak. (2) All anti-Japanese armed forces in the liberated areas and occupied areas of China, under the command of the headquarters in Yan'an, have the right, based on the provisions of the Potsdam Declaration and the surrender procedures stipulated by the Allies, to accept the surrender of Japanese and puppet troops surrounded by our forces, to seize their weapons and resources, and to implement all the regulations of the Allies after the surrender. (3) The broad masses of the liberated areas and occupied areas of China and all anti-Japanese armed forces should have the right to send their representatives to participate in the Allies' acceptance of the enemy's surrender and the handling of post-surrender matters. (4) The liberated areas and all anti-Japanese armed forces should have the right to send their representatives to participate in future peace conferences on the handling of Japan and the United Nations conference. (5) To reduce the danger of civil war in China, we request that the government of the United States of America, standing on the common interests of the Chinese and American peoples, immediately stop the execution of the Lend-Lease Act to the Kuomintang government. If the Kuomintang government launches a nationwide civil war (the danger of which is now extremely serious), do not provide assistance to the Kuomintang government.

August 23: The reactionary Kuomintang government's Chief of the General Staff, He Yingqin, orders the Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese forces in China, Okamura Yasuji, in Nanjing: "A. Illegal armed organizations that unilaterally pursue and seize weapons from the Japanese army before the designated National Army takes over should be responsible for effective defense. B. Currently, bandits are attacking Kaifeng, Tianjin, Zhengzhou, and other places. ... Regarding this matter, special attention should be paid at present, and the designated Japanese troops should be concentrated in the above-mentioned places where bandits are attacking and other places, to take effective defensive measures. If various places are occupied by bandits, the Japanese army should be responsible, and the Japanese army should take them back." Here, the traitorous Kuomintang government openly stands with the Japanese invaders against the People's Liberation Army, which it defames as "bandits." The traitorous Kuomintang government not only does not allow the People's Liberation Army to recover lost territory from the Japanese, but also orders the Japanese to "recover lost territory" from the People's Liberation Army.

August 25: The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China issues a statement on the current situation. Although, as mentioned earlier, the Kuomintang reactionary government began to reverse its course immediately after Japan's surrender, intensifying preparations for a full-scale civil war, the CPC Central Committee still expresses in this statement on the current situation its urgent desire to save domestic peace. The statement says: "The war of resistance has been won, and the new era of peace construction has begun. We must insist on peace, democracy, and unity, and strive for an independent, free, and prosperous new China." The statement demands that the Kuomintang government implement the following urgent measures to lay the foundation for future peace construction: "(1) Recognize the elected governments and anti-Japanese armies in the liberated areas, withdraw the troops surrounding and attacking the liberated areas, and immediately realize peace to avoid civil war. (2) Define the areas where the Eighth Route Army, New Fourth Army, and South China Anti-Japanese Corps will accept the surrender of Japanese troops, and give them the right to participate in all work related to the handling of Japan, to show fairness. (3) Severely punish traitors and disband the puppet army. (4) Fairly and reasonably reorganize the army, demobilize soldiers, relieve the suffering of the people, reduce taxes to alleviate the people's hardships. (5) Recognize the legal status of all parties, abolish all laws that hinder the people's freedom of assembly, association, speech, and publication, abolish secret police agencies, release patriotic political prisoners. (6) Immediately convene a conference of representatives of all parties and non-partisan figures to discuss major issues after the end of the war of resistance, formulate a democratic governance program, end the period of political tutelage, establish a unified democratic coalition government, and prepare for a free and unrestricted national congress."

August 28: To avoid civil war, Chairman Mao Zedong of the CPC Central Committee flies to Chongqing to negotiate peace, democracy, and unity with the Kuomintang government. August 29: He Yingqin secretly orders all war zones to print and distribute the reactionary documents "Bandit Suppression Manual" edited by Chiang Kai-shek and He Yingqin during the anti-people civil war from 1927 to 1936. This is another piece of evidence that Chiang Kai-shek, He Yingqin, and others claim to seek peace but are actually determined to wage civil war.

September 10: The People's Liberation Army repels the Nationalist army of Fu Zuoyi, which had advanced to the outskirts of Zhangjiakou. During the war of resistance against Japan, Fu Zuoyi's main forces were concentrated in the Suixi-Shanbei area. The People's Liberation Army had already liberated most of the land east of Baotou in Suizhong and Chahar before and after Japan's surrender. A telegram from the deputy commander of the 16th Army, Liu Wanchun, to his internal forces on September 23 states: "Since our army advanced eastward, the troops have caused unrest in the local area, even committing rape and looting, discipline has been lost, and public resentment is boiling over." September 30: U.S. troops land in Tianjin. The landing of U.S. military forces in China is an act of aggression and interference in China's internal affairs, which cannot be concealed. The U.S. government claims that this is to assist China in accepting the surrender and repatriating prisoners of war, but in fact, it is to disrupt China's acceptance of the surrender and repatriation. The true intention of the U.S. government is to help its puppet, the Kuomintang reactionary government, gain the upper hand in the anti-people civil war, so as to turn China into a colony of the United States. After landing in Tianjin, U.S. troops freely enter and exit places like Tanggu and Qinhuangdao, and together with the Kuomintang army, they occupy the liberated areas of Suizhong, such as Qinhuangdao, Beidaihe, Liushuikou, Haiyang Town, Shenzhai Town, and guard the strategic points of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway in Tianjin and Jinghai, to facilitate the Kuomintang army's supply of troops and materials.

October 4: A U.S. warship enters the port of Yantai in the liberated area of the people and sends officers ashore, openly threatening the People's Liberation Army to hand over Yantai to the U.S. military for "acceptance." The next day, representatives of the People's Liberation Army send a serious protest to the Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. forces in China, Wedemeyer, and the U.S. warship is forced to leave. October 10: U.S. troops land in Qingdao. At the same time, three squadrons of the U.S. Navy Air Force are stationed in Qingdao and Beijing. October 10: Representatives of the Communist Party of China, Zhou Enlai and Wang Ruofei, and representatives of the Kuomintang government, Wang Shijie, Zhang Qun, Zhang Zhizhong, and Shao Lizi, after 40 days of negotiations, sign a memorandum of talks, announcing that both sides agree to "resolutely avoid civil war and build an independent, free, and prosperous new China." The main points of the agreement are: to determine the basic policy of peaceful construction; to confirm that the Kuomintang should quickly end the period of political tutelage and realize political democratization; to guarantee that the people enjoy the democratic freedoms that the people of democratic countries should enjoy; equal status and legality of parties; abolition of secret police agencies; release of political prisoners; implementation of local self-government and holding of universal elections from the bottom up, etc. The main unresolved issue is the problem of the People's Liberation Army and the liberated areas. The Kuomintang reactionary government insists on not recognizing the People's Liberation Army and the liberated areas, which shows that the Kuomintang reactionary government and its negotiators have not relaxed their counter-revolutionary civil war plans throughout the negotiations. Regarding the problem of the People's Liberation Army, the CPC side proposed to reorganize the national army fairly and reasonably, and the anti-Japanese army led by the CPC can be largely demobilized. The anti-Japanese army in eight regions, including Guangdong, Zhejiang, southern Jiangsu, southern Anhui, central Anhui, Hunan, Hubei, and Henan (excluding northern Henan), can quickly start demobilization and immediately withdraw to northern Jiangsu, northern Anhui, and other places. The entire People's Liberation Army can be reduced to 24 divisions or at least 20 divisions. However, the Kuomintang reactionary government expressed that the army under its leadership has already been reorganized, and did not give any positive response to the reorganization of the anti-Japanese army led by the CPC, only saying "it can be considered." Regarding the problem of the people's government in the liberated areas, the CPC side proposed four solutions, all of which were unreasonably rejected by the Kuomintang reactionary government. In addition, regarding the National Assembly, the CPC advocates the abolition of the representatives of the fake National Assembly produced by the Kuomintang reactionaries before the war of resistance against Japan, the revision of the reactionary National Assembly Organization Law, Election Law, and Constitution Draft formulated by the Kuomintang reactionaries, and the Kuomintang side also expressed that it cannot accept this. Since the Kuomintang reactionary government has not relaxed its plans for civil war and dictatorship, the agreements already obtained in the negotiations, first of all, the agreement on "resolutely avoiding civil war," have been completely destroyed by the Kuomintang reactionary government. The Kuomintang government representatives who signed the agreement either actively participated in this destruction or remained silent and did nothing. In fact, two days before this agreement was signed, Chiang Kai-shek was still using airplanes to send "Bandit Suppression Manuals" to Yan Xishan. This document was obtained due to an airplane crash. After Mao Zedong, Chairman of the CPC, returned to Yan'an on November 11, and the memorandum of talks was published on November 12, Chiang Kai-shek issued a "bandit suppression" secret order on November 13, which was also seized by the People's Liberation Army. The order states: "With the victory of the war of resistance, the enemy has surrendered, and we must quickly build up our strength to complete the great cause of the war of resistance. However, bandits have taken the opportunity to invade cities, disrupt transportation, and attempt to disrupt unity, in order to achieve their plot of division. If we do not quickly suppress them, not only will the eight years of resistance be in vain, but it will also leave endless harm, making the Chinese nation have no hope of revival. How can we, the soldiers, face the deceased compatriots, and how can we face the fallen soldiers? Your commanding officer has been distinguished for his merits since the war of resistance, and the party and the country rely on you as a bulwark. This time, the suppression of bandits is for the happiness of the people, and you must follow the spirit of the past resistance war, follow the bandit suppression manual compiled by me, and urge your subordinates to strive to complete the task. Those who complete the task will certainly be rewarded, and those who delay and cause mistakes will certainly be punished according to the law. Please instruct your subordinates to strictly follow this." In this month, the Nationalist army of Yan Xishan, which invaded the liberated area of Jin Dongnan, numbering more than 30,000, was completely annihilated by the People's Liberation Army. Many high-ranking officers, including the commander of the 19th Army, Shi Zebo, were captured. The invasion of Yan Xishan's forces began during the Chongqing talks in late September, and was the first large-scale attack by the Kuomintang reactionary army on the People's Liberation Army since Japan's surrender, using a total of 13 divisions. The Jin Dongnan area was the headquarters of the People's Liberation Army's field army throughout the war of resistance, and since 1939, there had been no Yan Xishan or any other Kuomintang army. After Japan's surrender, Yan Xishan openly colluded with the Japanese invaders, and used Japanese troops to participate in the anti-people civil war, killing people indiscriminately, and was extremely hated by the people of Shanxi. October 17: The General Headquarters of the People's Liberation Army announces that since Japan's surrender, the Kuomintang army has occupied 31 cities in the liberated areas. October 18: The People's Liberation Army in the liberated areas south of the Yangtze River, including Su Nan, Huai Nan, Zhe Dong, and Zhe Xi, begins to withdraw to the north of the Yangtze River. October 31: In accordance with Chiang Kai-shek's "bandit suppression" order, the 8th, 30th, and 40th armies, totaling more than 70,000, advance along the Pinghan Railway towards the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu liberated area and are completely annihilated by the People's Liberation Army in the Hanzhong area. The deputy commander-in-chief of the First War Zone, Ma Fawu, and other generals and colonels are captured.

November 4: General Zhu De of the People's Liberation Army protests to the Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. forces in China, Wedemeyer, for the U.S. military's armed interference in China's internal affairs. November 7: The General Headquarters of the People's Liberation Army announces that the Kuomintang government has mobilized 1 million regular troops and commanded 700,000 Japanese and puppet troops to attack the liberated areas. November 8: The Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. forces in China, Wedemeyer, threatens in Shanghai that "U.S. troops in North China may advance towards the Communist Party's army." November 11: 31 U.S. warships transport Kuomintang troops to land in Qinhuangdao. This is the beginning of the U.S. Navy transporting Kuomintang troops to the front lines of the civil war. November 15: The U.S. government announces that it will continue to provide lend-lease materials to assist the Kuomintang government, which is another step by the U.S. government to create and expand the counter-revolutionary civil war in China. According to the U.S. State Department, by the end of June 1947, this assistance amounted to 777,638,292 dollars. On the same day, U.S. planes cover the Kuomintang army's invasion of Shanhaiguan. November 19: Representatives of various circles in Chongqing establish the Anti-Civil War United Front, calling on the people in the Kuomintang-controlled areas to take action against the Kuomintang's civil war policy and the U.S. interference in China's internal affairs. This movement simultaneously occurs in other major cities in the Kuomintang-controlled areas. The Kuomintang reactionary government suppresses this just movement of the people and instructs its followers to put forward reactionary slogans such as "oppose the opposition to civil war," "oppose internal disorder," and "suppress the disorder," clearly expressing its determination to wage civil war.

December 1: The Kuomintang reactionary government massacres students and teachers in Kunming who oppose civil war and U.S. interference in China's internal affairs, killing four and injuring dozens. The anti-civil war patriotic movement of Kunming students began on November 25 and lasted for a month. After the massacre, large-scale protests and strikes supporting the movement occur in various places, with the main targets being opposition to civil war and U.S. interference in China's internal affairs. December 4: U.S. troops shell a village in the liberated area of Lu Long County. December 15: Truman issues a policy statement on China. Although the statement claims to support China's unity and democracy and guarantees that the U.S. will not use military intervention to influence any internal conflict in China, subsequent events prove that this is merely a deception. The statement uses various false pretexts to justify the stationing of the U.S. Army and Navy in China, even claiming that the purpose is to ensure that "China becomes a unified, democratic, and peaceful country." However, this sophistry only proves the U.S. government's military interference in China's internal affairs. The statement also states: "The existence of autonomous armies, such as the Communist Party's army, is inconsistent with China's political unity." This reactionary and arbitrary statement reveals the U.S. government's plan to support the Kuomintang reactionary government in waging a counter-revolutionary civil war. December 20: U.S. President's special envoy Marshall comes to China under the pretext of "mediating" the Chinese civil war. December 22: The U.S. Navy begins transporting Kuomintang troops led by Du Yuming to the Northeast to attack the People's Liberation Army. December 27: The Moscow Conference of the Foreign Ministers of the Soviet Union, the United States, and Britain issues a statement on the Chinese issue, stating that "they are faithful to the policy of non-interference in China's internal affairs. ... Mr. Molotov stated: The Soviet Army has completed the task of disarming the Japanese army in Manchuria and withdrawing the Japanese army from there. However, at the request of the Chinese government, the Soviet Army will delay its withdrawal until February 1. Mr. Byrnes stated that the U.S. Army is stationed in North China at the request of the Chinese government, and the main responsibility of the U.S. Army is to execute the conditions of Japan's surrender, that is, to disarm and withdraw the Japanese army. He stated: Once these tasks are completed, or if the Chinese government cannot execute these tasks without the assistance of the U.S. Army, the U.S. Army will withdraw from China." The Soviet Union has since faithfully implemented this resolution, but the U.S. government is still interfering in China's internal affairs and has troops stationed in China. On the same day, the CPC delegation in Chongqing proposes to the Kuomintang reactionary government to immediately stop the war unconditionally, but the proposal is rejected by the Kuomintang reactionary government.

**1946**

January 10: The CPC Central Committee and the Kuomintang government simultaneously issue a ceasefire order. On the one hand, this is the result of the CPC and the people across the nation insisting on fighting for peace, and on the other hand, it is the result of the Kuomintang reactionary government, under the instructions of U.S. special envoy Marshall, recognizing that it must gain time to fully deploy its army to maintain its reactionary rule. Since the Kuomintang reactionary government and its U.S. master have such a plot, the Kuomintang reactionary army has never faithfully abided by the ceasefire order, and after the ceasefire order, it continues to attack the liberated areas in many places, especially in the Northeast, with the help of the U.S. and the deployment of troops to the front lines of the civil war. Chiang Kai-shek had issued a secret order to "quickly seize strategic points" three days before the ceasefire order was issued. On the same day, to implement the ceasefire order, the Military Adjustment Executive Committee is established in Beijing by representatives of the Kuomintang government, the CPC, and the U.S. government, with equal voting rights from the three parties, and several Military Adjustment Executive Subcommittees are set up under it, which are sent to various conflict points for mediation. In fact, the Kuomintang representatives and the U.S. representatives do not stop the Kuomintang army from violating the ceasefire order, so the Kuomintang army's attacks continue to occur, and after half a year, they expand into a nationwide civil war. On the same day, the Political Consultative Conference opens in Chongqing and closes on January 31. This conference is attended by the Kuomintang, the CPC, the Democratic League (the Democratic Socialist Party was also included at the time), the Youth Party, and non-partisan figures, with reactionaries in the majority. However, under the pressure of the people and the fact that the Kuomintang government's preparations for war had not been fully completed, they unanimously passed many resolutions reflecting the people's wishes and conducive to peace, democracy, and unity under the conditions at the time. These resolutions include the program for peaceful construction, and the reorganization of the national army based on democratic principles, the reorganization of the National Government, the revision of the Constitution Draft, and the convening of the National Assembly. In addition, Chiang Kai-shek announced at the opening of the Political Consultative Conference that he would guarantee the people's freedoms, guarantee the legal status of all parties, implement universal suffrage, and release political prisoners. However, whether it is Chiang Kai-shek himself, or the Kuomintang representatives Sun Ke, Wu Tiecheng, Chen Lifu, Chen Guofu, Zhang Lisheng, Wang Shijie, Shao Lizi, Zhang Qun, or the Youth Party representatives Zhang Qiqing, Chen Qitian, Yang Yongquan, Yu Jiaju, Chang Yansheng, or the Democratic Socialist Party representative Zhang Junmai, or the non-partisan representatives close to the Kuomintang Wang Yunwu, Fu Sinian, Hu Lin, Qian Yongming, Miao Jiaming, and Mo Dewen, they all betrayed their own promises and the resolutions they had once expressed support for. As the Kuomintang's war preparations progress, these reactionaries who pretended to support the Political Consultative Conference resolutions gradually, and finally completely, tore up the Political Consultative Conference resolutions.

February 10: The Kuomintang reactionary government directs its secret police to smash the celebration of the success of the Political Consultative Conference in Chongqing's Changqiao, injuring Guo Moruo, Li Gongpu, and many others. Before and after this, similar rallies and parades in various major cities in the Kuomintang-controlled areas were also disrupted by Kuomintang secret police. These incidents clearly show the Kuomintang reactionary government's opposition to the Political Consultative Conference resolutions and its insistence on dictatorship and civil war. February 21: The Kuomintang reactionary government directs its secret police to disrupt and smash the Military Adjustment Executive Committee in Beijing. February 22: The Kuomintang reactionary government organizes an anti-Soviet, anti-Communist parade in Chongqing and smashes the Chongqing New China Daily and the Democratic Daily. After this, the Kuomintang reactionary government continuously organized similar parades advocating civil war in other major cities.

March 1 to 17: The Kuomintang holds its Second Plenary Session of the Central Committee. Chiang Kai-shek openly calls for the destruction of the Political Consultative Conference resolutions at the meeting, saying that "we should carefully consider the major issues and take appropriate measures to remedy them." The meeting resolution overturns the democratic principles in the Political Consultative Conference's resolution on the Constitution Draft and passes several resolutions against the CPC. March 18: The CPC Central Committee's spokesperson exposes the Kuomintang's destruction of the Political Consultative Conference resolutions and calls on the people across the nation to make a serious struggle to insist on the implementation of all the Political Consultative Conference resolutions. March 19: The U.S. government sends a military advisory group to the Kuomintang reactionary government. On the same day, the Kuomintang reactionary government directs its secret police to assassinate Li Zhaolin, the former leader of the Northeast Anti-Japanese Allied Army, in Harbin. March 27: The Northeast Ceasefire Agreement is established. When the ceasefire order was issued on January 10, the Kuomintang reactionary government representatives insisted that the Northeast was not within the scope of the ceasefire order. After the Political Consultative Conference, the Kuomintang government, with the help of U.S. special envoy Marshall and the U.S. Navy, transports a large number of troops to the Northeast to expand the civil war in the Northeast. At this point, through the efforts of the CPC and the people across the nation, the Kuomintang government reluctantly agrees in words to the Northeast ceasefire. However, by March 31, the Kuomintang immediately breaks this agreement and launches a large-scale attack on Yingkou, Benxi, and Siping in the Northeast. March 28: The Kuomintang reactionary government directs its secret police to assassinate four democratic youth in Nantong, Jiangsu, and throw them into the Yangtze River, and continues to massacre and arrest dozens of people.

April 1: Chiang Kai-shek, at the reactionary-controlled National Congress, delivers a speech, openly overturning the Northeast Ceasefire Agreement, declaring that "military conflict mediation can only be conducted on the premise that it does not affect the exercise of national administrative power"; at the same time, he openly overturns the Political Consultative Conference resolutions, saying that "the Political Consultative Conference is not a constitutional conference in essence, ... if the Political Consultative Conference becomes such a conference, our government will never recognize it." April 6: The Yan'an Liberation Daily publishes an editorial "Refuting Chiang Kai-shek" to strongly condemn him. April 3: The Kuomintang government arrests 39 staff members of the Beijing Liberation Daily, which is run by the CPC. April 8: CPC representatives Wang Ruofei and Qin Bangxian fly to Yan'an due to the Kuomintang's overthrow of the Political Consultative Conference resolutions, and Ye Ting and Deng Xiaoping accompany them. Along the way, they encounter an airplane crash and die. April 9: Chiang Kai-shek secretly meets with American journalists, expressing his determination to eliminate the Communist Party, "now it all depends on the attitude of the United States." April 16: The 87th Division of the Kuomintang army, which is attacking the outskirts of Siping, is annihilated. April 18: The Northeast People's Liberation Army liberates Changchun from the hands of the puppet army. The next day, the Dushikeng of the Kuomintang's Political Study Group publishes an editorial "The Shameful Battle of Changchun," opposing the People's Liberation Army's liberation of Changchun and the entire self-defense war of the People's Liberation Army.

May 1: The Northwest responsible person of the Democratic League, Li Furen, is assassinated by Kuomintang secret police in Xianyang and is rescued but not killed. May 3: The Soviet Army completes its withdrawal from the Northeast. Note: The Soviet Army's withdrawal was delayed several times due to the Kuomintang government's repeated requests. May 7: Xinhua News Agency publishes that since the ceasefire order was issued on January 10 until the beginning of this month, the Kuomintang's regular army has made 35 army-level and 99 division-level adjustments for the continuation of the civil war, with a total of more than one million troops. This illegal adjustment, which violates the ceasefire order, fully shows that the Kuomintang army is intensively preparing for a new nationwide large-scale civil war. May 20, 22, 28: The Kuomintang army, equipped and transported by the United States, successively occupies Siping, Changchun, and Yongji. The Kuomintang army suffered heavy losses from the People's Liberation Army in the battle of Siping. Note: After the establishment of the Northeast Ceasefire Agreement, the U.S. Navy became more active in transporting troops to the Northeast for the Kuomintang government, calculating that by the end of March, three armies were transported, and by the end of April and the beginning of May, two more armies were transported. Including the beginning of the month, a total of more than seven armies have been transported. The CPC had protested to Marshall about this troop transport, which violates Marshall's own promise, pointing out that the U.S. government should be responsible for the consequences of this matter. May 29: The Kuomintang government seals the Beijing Liberation Daily, which is run by the CPC, and simultaneously seals 77 other newspapers and news agencies in Beijing. May 31: The 184th Division of the Kuomintang army in the Northeast, led by Commander Pan Suo, mutinies in Haicheng. After this, due to the continued strong resistance of the People's Liberation Army and the dispersion and weakening of the Kuomintang army's strength, and because most of the Kuomintang army is tied down in the interior and cannot continue to reinforce, the Kuomintang army's offensive in the Northeast turns into a local offensive.

June 14: U.S. Secretary of State Byrnes submits the "Military Aid to China Act" to the U.S. Senate. Mid-June: The Kuomintang reactionary government representatives propose five absurd conditions to the CPC, attempting to force the CPC to surrender. The conditions are: to demand that the People's Liberation Army withdraw from the following areas: (1) All areas south of the Longhai Railway; (2) The entire Jiaoji Railway; (3) Chengde and all areas south of Chengde to the eastern coast of Hebei; (4) All provinces in the Northeast except the provinces of Heilongjiang, Xing'an, and the northern and central parts of Nenjiang Province, and the Yanji area; (5) All areas liberated by the CPC from the puppet army in Shandong and Shanxi after June 7. And it is stated that if the CPC does not withdraw from the above-mentioned areas, the Kuomintang government will not consider the ceasefire issue. The reactionary demands of the Kuomintang reactionary government make the ceasefire talks held in Nanjing in June fruitless. These reactionary demands are insisted on by the Kuomintang reactionary government for several months and are handed over to the CPC representatives again in early August through Marshall and the U.S. Ambassador to China, Stuart. During the talks, the Kuomintang government also formally proposed in a written document to hand over the "final decision-making power" of the Sino-American talks to Marshall, and Marshall himself also tacitly agreed. June 20: CPC representative Zhou Enlai in Nanjing declares opposition to the Kuomintang's proposal to hand over the "final decision-making power" on the Chinese issue to Marshall. June 21: The CPC Political Consultative Conference delegation proposes to the Kuomintang government four suggestions for a long-term ceasefire, restoration of transportation, reorganization of the army, and reopening of the Political Consultative Conference, and hopes to continue negotiations on this basis to finally stop the Kuomintang government's already prepared full-scale civil war, but the proposal is rejected by the Kuomintang. June 22: CPC Central Committee Chairman Mao Zedong issues a statement opposing the U.S. "Military Aid to China Act," announcing that "we resolutely oppose the U.S. government continuing to provide military aid to the Kuomintang dictatorship in China through selling, exchanging, lending, giving, or transferring military equipment, we resolutely oppose the U.S. sending a military mission to China, and we resolutely demand that the U.S. immediately stop and withdraw all its so-called military aid to China and immediately withdraw all U.S. troops from China." June 23: Ten thousand people in Shanghai hold a demonstration against civil war and U.S. interference in China's internal affairs, selecting Ma Xulun and others as representatives to petition in Nanjing. Ma and others are brutally beaten by Kuomintang secret police when they arrive in Nanjing that evening. June 26: The Kuomintang army launches a large-scale attack on the Central Plains Liberation Army in the eastern Hubei and southern Henan regions, which is a signal for the Kuomintang to launch a full-scale civil war. The Central Plains Liberation Army breaks out. June 27: The U.S. State Department approves the establishment of the 8.33rd Air Force Squadron for the Kuomintang government to conduct civil war. Note: From September 1945 to this month, the U.S. Navy and Air Force have transported 14 armies, 41 divisions, 8 traffic police brigades, and about 540,000 troops to the front lines of the civil war. This decisively helps the Kuomintang reactionary government complete the main preparatory steps for launching a full-scale civil war.

July 7: The CPC Central Committee issues a declaration commemorating the 9th anniversary of the "July 7th" incident. The declaration, after analyzing the attacks by the Kuomintang reactionary government and the U.S. imperialist government on the Chinese people, appeals for: (1) Unconditionally, unconditionally, and indefinitely stopping conflicts, stopping the movement of troops, stopping the construction of fortifications, and stopping the conscription of soldiers. (2) Reopening the Political Consultative Conference and implementing all the resolutions of the previous Political Consultative Conference. (3) Implementing demobilization and reduction of military expenditures. (4) Requesting the U.S. to stop interfering in China's internal affairs, stop fomenting the Chinese civil war, and withdraw all its troops from China. The declaration says: "If the greedy and unscrupulous reactionaries insist on challenging, then let us be prepared to send all the reactionaries who dare to challenge back!" July 11 and 15: The Kuomintang reactionary government directs its secret police to assassinate Li Gongpu and Wen Yiduo, leaders of the Democratic League in Kunming. July 12: The Kuomintang's 500,000 troops launch a large-scale attack on the Su-Huai liberated area along the 800-kilometer front from Luan to Nantong. The Kuomintang army's attack on the liberated areas is thus fully launched. The Kuomintang government uses 200 divisions, about 2 million troops, accounting for 85% of the Kuomintang army's combat strength, in this full-scale civil war. At this time, the total number of the Kuomintang army reaches 4.3 million, while the total number of the People's Liberation Army is only 1.2 million, and its equipment is far inferior to that of the Kuomintang army. Relying on the numerical and equipment superiority, Chiang Kai-shek and his Chief of Staff Chen Cheng both boast that "within two months, the Communist Party's army in Subei will be annihilated, and within five months, the entire Communist Party will be solved militarily." At the end of this month, Kuomintang reactionary government Defense Minister Bai Chongxi, at a military conference in Xinxiang, declares: "The American friend, General Marshall, has criticized us for not fighting well outside the Great Wall, and the Kuomintang army is useless, so this time everyone must fight for honor, otherwise General Marshall will criticize us again for being useless." July 15: The People's Liberation Army annihilates an entire brigade of the invading Kuomintang army in the Taixing area of Suzhong. From July 15 to August 27, the People's Liberation Army wins seven consecutive victories in the Suzhong area, annihilating 13 brigades of the invading Kuomintang army, including 7 entire brigades, capturing more than 50,000 troops. The People's Liberation Army, in its operations, aims primarily at annihilating the enemy's combat forces, not at conserving or capturing cities and places, so although it retreats from many cities and some rural areas in the face of the Kuomintang army's offensive, it ultimately breaks the enemy's offensive and turns to the offensive. July 16: The U.S. Congress passes a resolution to "donate" 271 ships to the Kuomintang traitorous government to conduct counter-revolutionary civil war. July 22: Chen Lifu, in Shanghai, gives a speech, comparing the solution of the Communist Party issue to treating appendicitis, advocating the use of surgery. July 29: U.S. troops invade the liberated area of Anping Town in Suizhong, shooting at the People's Liberation Army.

August 10: Marshall and the U.S. Ambassador to China, Stuart, issue a joint statement. After the U.S. government has helped the Kuomintang reactionary government launch a full-scale attack on the liberated areas, Marshall and Stuart defend the Kuomintang reactionary government by saying: "Both the Kuomintang and the Communist Party want to end the war, but there are still unresolved issues that have not been agreed upon. It seems impossible to reach an agreement on the above issues." August 10 to 21: The People's Liberation Army annihilates more than 16,000 invading Kuomintang troops in the eastern section of the Longhai Railway in Henan. August 16: The Yan'an Liberation Daily publishes an editorial, calling on all the people in the liberated areas to mobilize urgently and smash Chiang Kai-shek's offensive. August 27: The Kuomintang army invades Chengde. August 28: The People's Liberation Army annihilates 9,000 invading Kuomintang troops of Yan Xishan's forces in the middle section of the Tongpu Railway. August 30: The Kuomintang traitorous government and U.S. Air Force officer Chennault establish an agreement to set up the Chennault Air Transport Company, responsible for the Kuomintang government's air transport of personnel and military supplies to the battlefields in the Northeast, North China, and Central China. August 31: The U.S. government, despite the CPC's opposition, sells at a low price the remaining military equipment from the Pacific War worth more than 800 million dollars to the Kuomintang government.

September 3 to 9: The People's Liberation Army annihilates four entire brigades of the invading Kuomintang army in the Detao and Puzi areas of Shandong, capturing the enemy brigade commander Zhao Siti. September 14: After annihilating more than one brigade of the invading Kuomintang army, the People's Liberation Army withdraws from Jining. After this, the Kuomintang army continues to advance towards Zhangjiakou. September 17: The Kuomintang army occupies Huaiyin. September 23: Chiang Kai-shek, in Nanchang, delivers a speech, praising the "glorious tradition" of the "bandit suppression" in Jiangxi more than ten years ago. On the same day, the people in various cities in China begin the week-long movement demanding the withdrawal of U.S. troops from China. September 24: The People's Liberation Army annihilates the invading 1st Division of the Kuomintang army in Fushan, Shandong, capturing the enemy division commander Huang Zhengcheng. September 30: Zhou Enlai sends a memorandum to Marshall and the Kuomintang government representatives, stating: "If the Kuomintang does not immediately stop all military actions against Zhangjiakou and its surroundings, the CPC representatives cannot but consider that the government has publicly declared a complete breakdown and has finally abandoned the policy of political settlement; the serious consequences caused by this will, of course, be fully borne by the government." However, the Kuomintang government still refuses to stop the attack on Zhangjiakou.

October 11: The Kuomintang army occupies Zhangjiakou. The occupation of Zhangjiakou represents the highest point of the Kuomintang army's full-scale offensive. Therefore, in the afternoon of the same day, Chiang Kai-shek, intoxicated by "victory," issues an order to convene a split, dictatorial, and fake National Assembly in violation of the Political Consultative Conference resolutions. However, in fact, due to the continuous annihilation of combat forces, the Kuomintang army's offensive gradually declines and soon turns from a full-scale offensive to a concentrated offensive. October 17: The CPC Central Committee issues a statement on the current situation, recounting that the CPC, in order to achieve domestic peace, has made eight major concessions in the following: (1) The memorandum of talks on October 10, 1945; (2) The ceasefire agreement on January 10, 1946; (3) The five resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference on January 31; (4) The military reorganization plan on February 25; (5) The Northeast ceasefire agreement on March 27; (6) The peace talks in June; (7) The expression of willingness to participate in the reorganization of the government under the ceasefire conditions after the failure of the June talks; (8) The expression of willingness to start military and political talks as long as the Kuomintang army stops the attack on Zhangjiakou at the beginning of October. It can be seen that the Chiang and the U.S. are only pursuing the elimination of the Chinese democratic movement. The statement points out: In view of the mediation of the third party, the CPC is still willing to make the final and greatest concession, that is, to restore the military positions on January 13, 1946, and to realize all the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference on January 31 as a precondition for conducting peace talks. The Kuomintang reactionary government still rejects the above proposal of the CPC. After the CPC's statement on the current situation is issued, the Kuomintang leaders Peng Xuepei and Wu Tiecheng successively issue statements, claiming that the entire national territory should be under the jurisdiction of the Kuomintang reactionary government, and that the restoration of the military positions on January 13 is "impossible." October 18: Chiang Kai-shek holds a secret military conference in Nanjing and once again announces that "the Communist Party will be crushed within five months." Bai Chongxi, at this meeting, delivers a speech, believing that it is necessary to implement Chiang Kai-shek's "bandit suppression" tactics in Jiangxi, "three parts military, seven parts political." At the same time, Chen Cheng holds another military conference in Beijing, also repeatedly declaring that "within three to five months, the problem can be solved militarily." October 19 to 26: The People's Liberation Army annihilates an entire brigade in the defensive battle of Lianhua in northern Jiangsu. October 25: The Kuomintang army occupies Anshan.

November 1 to 2: The People's Liberation Army annihilates an entire brigade of the invading Kuomintang army in the Huandian and Huanren areas of South Manchuria, capturing the enemy brigade commander Li Zhengyi. November 4: The Kuomintang traitorous government signs a treaty with the U.S. imperialist government that severely infringes upon China's economic sovereignty, the "Sino-American Friendship Trade and Navigation Treaty." This treacherous treaty is directly presided over by the fake Premier Song Ziwen and the fake Ambassador to the U.S. Gu Weijun, and signed by the fake Foreign Minister Wang Shijie on behalf of the Kuomintang government. November 12: Gu Weijun, at the National Foreign Trade Conference in New York, USA, declares that according to the "Sino-American Commercial Treaty," "the entire territory of China is open to American businessmen." November 15: Chiang Kai-shek convenes a reactionary and illegal National Assembly in violation of the Political Consultative Conference resolutions to pass a reactionary and dictatorial fake constitution. The Kuomintang representatives Zhang Qun, Shao Lizi, and others who had participated in the passage of the Political Consultative Conference resolutions, as well as the representatives of the Youth Party, the Democratic Socialist Party, and the so-called social elites Wang Yunwu, Fu Sinian, Mo Dewen, Hu Lin, etc., all participate in this fake National Assembly. The presidium of the fake National Assembly includes Li Zongren, Bai Chongxi, Wang Yunwu, Mo Dewen, Hu Shi, Yu Bin, etc. However, all democratic parties and non-partisan democrats refuse to participate in the fake National Assembly. Therefore, even the newspapers of American imperialism, such as the New York Herald Tribune, have to admit: "Those who listen to Chiang Kai-shek's speech are all reactionaries." After passing the reactionary and dictatorial fake constitution, the fake National Assembly closes on December 25. December 28: The CPC declares that the fake National Assembly and the fake constitution formulated by Chiang Kai-shek are both illegal and invalid. The China Democratic League, the Three Principles of the People's Alliance, and the Shanghai Workers' Association, among others, successively declare that they do not recognize the fake constitution. November 19 to 21: The People's Liberation Army annihilates two entire brigades of the invading Kuomintang army in the Puyang and Huaxian areas of northern Henan, capturing the enemy brigade commander Yang Xianming. November 22: Molotov condemns in the United Nations Political Committee the U.S. violation of the December 1945 Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference resolution by continuing to station troops in China. November 30: The Kuomintang traitorous government signs a treaty with the U.S. imperialist government that infringes upon China's airspace sovereignty, the "Sino-American Air Transport Agreement." On the same day, the Kuomintang reactionary government orders the military police in Shanghai to massacre street vendors, killing seven and injuring and arresting many. On December 2, 5,000 street vendors besiege the Kuomintang police station in Shanghai all day, and are again massacred by the Kuomintang military police, killing ten and injuring more than a hundred.

December 3: U.S. President Truman awards the "Freedom Medal" to the Kuomintang army generals Du Yuming, Zheng Dongguo, Zhao Jiaqing, Xiao Yaoxiang, and Zhao Gongwu, who attacked the people of the Northeast. Previously, Bai Chongxi and Chen Cheng had also received the same medal from Truman. December 15 to 19: The People's Liberation Army annihilates three brigades of the Kuomintang's reorganized 69th Division in the Suzhong area of Suining and Shuyang, killing the enemy division commander Dai Zhichi. December 24: A violent incident occurs in Beijing where U.S. soldiers rape a female student from Peking University, sparking nationwide student protests against U.S. atrocities and demanding the withdrawal of U.S. troops from China. From the end of this month to January 1947, tens of thousands of students in Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Nanjing, Kaifeng, Chongqing, Kunming, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Hangzhou, Suzhou, Taipei, and other places successively hold protests, strikes, and demonstrations. Since Japan's surrender, U.S. troops in China have been committing atrocities against Chinese compatriots, including killing, beating, and raping Chinese women. According to the Chongqing Democratic Daily, by the end of this year, more than 1,000 people have been killed under U.S. jeeps, 300 women have been raped, and more than 300 people have been beaten and injured by U.S. soldiers in Shanghai alone. According to the Shanghai Times, from August to the end of this year, there have been more than 800 incidents of U.S. jeeps running over and injuring people in Shanghai alone. The bloody crimes of the U.S. troops stationed in China without reason have aroused the great patriotic indignation of the Chinese people. However, the Kuomintang government protects the U.S. troops. After the incident of the rape of a female student from Peking University, the Kuomintang traitorous government, under the pretext of "disgracing the friendly country," prohibits all newspapers from reporting this news and sends military police everywhere to suppress the patriotic demonstrations of students. December 26: Chen Cheng, at the reception for the fake National Assembly representatives, declares that he will "eliminate the Communist Party within one year." December 27: The Kuomintang reactionary government, under the protection of the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration controlled by the U.S. imperialist government, violates the agreement reached in the summer between the CPC, the Kuomintang, and the UNRRA on the Yellow River, which stipulates that the river should be repaired and returned to its original course, and recklessly releases water to guide the Yellow River back to its original course, attempting to flood the liberated areas. December 30: Chiang Kai-shek issues a secret order, instructing his subordinates: "The combat objectives of various units in the first half of the 36th year should be to open the Longhai, Tianpu, Tongpu, Pinghan, and China-Eastern Railways, and to eliminate bandits in the areas of Hebei, Shandong, Shanxi, and Shaanxi. In the next year, the evil bandits should be completely eliminated."

**1947**

January 1: CPC Chairman Mao Zedong issues a New Year's address, predicting that in this year, "the Chinese people's struggle for democracy and freedom will achieve even more important victories than in 1946," and "an independent, peaceful, and democratic new China will definitely lay a solid foundation in the next few years."

The victories in southern and western Shandong seriously strike the Kuomintang reactionary government's offensive focused on Shandong, but the Kuomintang reactionary government continues to concentrate heavy troops in Shandong and continues the attack. January 7: Marshall, under the cover of "mediation," helps the Kuomintang reactionary government gain time to prepare for the civil war, equips and transports a large number of civil war troops for the Kuomintang reactionary government, provides a large amount of war materials assistance, and launches an unprecedented large-scale counter-revolutionary civil war. After his deception is completely exposed by the Chinese people, he returns to the U.S. January 16: Chiang Kai-shek, through Stuart, notifies the CPC that he wants to send Zhang Zhizhong to Yan'an for peace talks. January 17: The CPC Central Committee's responsible person issues a statement rejecting this, pointing out that "this is completely a deception. ... Zhang Zhizhong himself, on March 27 last year, represented Chiang Kai-shek in signing the Northeast ceasefire agreement, but only five days later, it was torn up by Chiang Kai-shek, and a large-scale battle broke out in the Northeast. ... Unless Chiang Kai-shek abolishes the fake constitution and restores the military positions on January 13 last year, there is no way to prove that he is not deceiving."

February 10: Due to the further deterioration of the Kuomintang reactionary government's economic crisis, Chiang Kai-shek issues the "Emergency Economic Measures Plan," using "economic police" to control the market, plunder small and medium-sized industrialists and businessmen, freeze the living index of workers, and prohibit workers from striking and private capitalists from closing factories. February 15: The Kuomintang army occupies Linyi, Shandong. February 20 to 23: The People's Liberation Army annihilates the invading Kuomintang army's 73rd Army, 46th Army, and one division of the 12th Army, totaling seven entire divisions, 50,000 troops, in Laiwu, Shandong, capturing the deputy commander of the 2nd Pacification Region, Li Xianzhu, and the commander of the 73rd Army, Han Jun. February 21: The CPC representatives in the Military Adjustment Executive Committee in Beijing, including Ye Jianying, are forced to return to Yan'an. February 27 and 28: The Kuomintang reactionary government notifies the CPC representatives in Nanjing, Shanghai, and Chongqing to withdraw to Yan'an by March 5, and immediately surrounds and monitors the CPC representatives in the three places with secret police, and declares that "in the future, if CPC members are found, they will be treated as bandit spies and punished according to the law." The CPC representatives in the three places all return to Yan'an on March 7. The Kuomintang's final action of expelling CPC members shows that it has completely cut itself off from the people. February 28: Due to the Kuomintang reactionary government's command of the military police to massacre civilians in Taipei, the people of the entire island rise up in armed rebellion. By March 8, the rebels had controlled most of the cities in Taiwan. The Kuomintang reactionary government carries out a bloody massacre of the rebels.

Chiang Kai-shek and Chen Cheng both declare at the meeting that they will fight to the end. Chen Cheng, on March 20, at a reception for reporters, says: "I have said that if we really fight, it only takes three months to break the main force of the Communist Party, but in the past, because of the negotiations, the National Army was mostly passive and suffered defeats. The government's purpose in using troops is to suppress the rebellion, and it will not stop until the Communist Party is completely disarmed."

On June 1, the Nationalist Party's reactionary government ordered military police to kill three students from Wuhan University. The Nationalist Party government arrested thousands of peaceful citizens across the country, with the most notable incidents being: from June 1 to 5, 700 students, teachers, and journalists were arrested in Chongqing; from June 1 to 3, over 1,000 people were arrested in Guangzhou; on June 2, 1,800 residents were arrested in Guiyang; on June 3, 152 students were arrested in Qingdao. According to newspaper reports, in May and June, the Nationalist Party government arrested over 13,000 students and citizens in major cities, causing over 400 deaths and injuries. On June 3, the People's Liberation Army recaptured Xifeng and Kaiyuan in Northeast China, annihilating an entire enemy division. On June 6, they recaptured Chifeng. On June 10, they recaptured Andong. On June 15, they launched an attack on Siping, annihilating 16,000 enemy troops. From June 12 to 15, the People's Liberation Army launched an offensive on the northern segments of the Tianpu and Pinghan railways, annihilating over 10,000 enemy troops and capturing Qing County, Yongqing County, and Cang County. On June 19, the Nationalist Party's China Student Union was established in Shanghai. Although the union was banned by the Nationalist Party's reactionary government, it continued to lead the patriotic struggle of students in Nationalist-controlled areas. On June 22, the vice chairman of the Nationalist Party's sellout government, Sun Ke, issued a statement accusing China's civil war of being caused by "the Soviet Union's inability to make America's efforts in China successful," and vigorously appealed for American aid to the Nationalist Party government's counter-revolutionary civil war, stating that if "America's response is lukewarm, it is equivalent to abandoning China." Sun Ke declared: "In military terms, as long as we fight to the end, we will ultimately succeed." On June 25, the Nationalist Party's reactionary government's Supreme Court issued "Order No. 1906," placing a bounty on the leader of the Chinese people, Mao Zedong. On June 27, the U.S. government provided 130 million bullets to the Nationalist Party army. On June 30, the Nationalist Party's Central Standing Committee and Political Committee held a joint meeting to pass the "Strengthening the Campaign Against Bandits" resolution, with the majority advocating the issuance of a decree of extermination. The meeting was attended by over 50 people, including Sun Ke, Zhang Qun, Chen Cheng, Chen Lifu, Zhang Lisheng, Zhu Jiahua, Gu Zhenggang, Gu Zhengding, Wu Zhongxin, Xu Yongchang, Deng Wenyi, Zheng Yanhong, and others, chaired by Sun Ke. From July to the end of the month, in the first year of the People's Liberation War, the Nationalist Party's army, which initiated the counter-revolutionary civil war, occupied 191,000 square kilometers of liberated areas, 18 million people, and 84 cities, reducing the liberated areas to 2.2 million square kilometers, the population to 131 million, and the number of cities to 422. However, the People's Liberation Army annihilated 97.5 enemy regular divisions (including 46 whole divisions) and a total of 1,120,000 enemy troops in one year. The Nationalist Party's army was reduced to 3.7 million, while the People's Liberation Army increased to 2 million. The People's Liberation Army's great victory in the first year of the war changed the situation in the second year, with the People's Liberation Army shifting from defense to offense and the Nationalist Party's army from offense to defense.

On July 1, the People's Liberation Army concluded its summer offensive in Northeast China, annihilating 82,000 enemy troops and capturing 43 cities. From July 1 to 8, the People's Liberation Army annihilated two enemy divisions in Fei County and Tai'an, Shandong. Since June 30, the People's Liberation Army in the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu front crossed the Yellow River, advancing to the southwest of Lu, and turned to the offensive. On July 8, in Yuncheng, they annihilated two brigades of the 55th Reorganized Division, capturing the deputy commander Li Mingya. On July 10, in Dingtao, they annihilated one brigade. From July 12 to 14, in the area between Juye and Jinxiang, they annihilated the 32nd and 70th Reorganized Divisions, capturing the commander Chen Yiding. On July 22, north of Jinxiang, they annihilated one brigade and one regiment, capturing the brigade commander Wang Shiqiao. On July 28, in Yangshanji, north of Jinxiang, they annihilated two brigades of the 66th Reorganized Division, capturing the commander Song Ruike. In just 20 days, they annihilated 9.5 enemy brigades, totaling over 60,000 troops. This marked the beginning of the People's Liberation Army's nationwide shift to the offensive. On July 4, the Nationalist Party's reactionary government held a "State Council Meeting," attended by "National Government Commissioners" including Nationalist Party members Chiang Kai-shek, Sun Ke, Zhang Qun, Ju Zheng, Dai Lian, Yu Youren, Zhang Jie, Zhou Ru, Song Ziwen, Weng Wenhao, Wang Ronghui, Shao Lizi, Wang Shijie, Chiang Menglin, Niu Yongjian, Wu Zhongxin, Chen Bulei, and others, as well as members of the Young China Party and the China Democratic Socialist Party. They unanimously passed Chiang Kai-shek's proposal to "implement a nationwide total mobilization to suppress the bandits, eliminate democratic obstacles, implement constitutional government as scheduled, and carry out the policy of peaceful nation-building." The reactionary elements responsible for the counter-revolutionary civil war all exposed their true colors. Yu Jiaju of the Young China Party said: "We should strengthen the campaign against bandits." Chen Qitian said: "We fully support the government's major measures." Jiang Yunshan of the China Democratic Socialist Party said: "We strongly support the campaign against the communists." Zhang Junmai said: "We hope the total mobilization plan will achieve the desired effect." The puppet provincial and municipal assemblies and the Nationalist Party's official "people's organizations" in various provinces and cities issued telegrams supporting the decree to suppress bandits, and held "National Defense and Reconstruction Mobilization Conferences" in various places. On July 7, Li Zongren, the chief of Chiang Kai-shek's Beijing Office, gave a speech stating: "All manpower and resources must be used to suppress the bandits, so that the internal turmoil can be quickly suppressed. The current stage is the most important for military affairs. If the military can be victorious, all problems can be solved." On July 11, Bai Chongxi gave a speech to the Nationalist Party's National Political Council, opposing peace talks, stating that the strength of the Communist Party was partly due to the truce policy of 1946, which prevented the government from attacking the weak Communist forces a year ago, allowing them to grow stronger. On July 20, the U.S. government's ambassador to Nanjing, Stuart, declared: "Given the current situation in China, the discussion of the peace treaty with Japan is secondary. The primary task is to suppress the communists militarily." On July 9, the Nationalist Party's reactionary government decided to dissolve the name and secretariat of the Political Consultative Conference. On July 25, the Nationalist Party's reactionary government issued an order to cancel the seats of Communist Party representatives in the National Assembly and the National Government Commission, and to expel current Communist Party members of the Political Council.

On August 2, the Nationalist Party's sellout government, following the instructions of the U.S. government, reopened trade with Japan, supplying large quantities of iron sand, phosphate, and salt as raw materials for Japanese industry, and allowing Japanese industrial products to be dumped into China again. On August 11, the People's Liberation Army, which had crossed the Yellow River from the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu front, advanced south across the Longhai Railway and reached the Dabie Mountains on August 28. On August 12, the People's Liberation Army annihilated an enemy division in Yancity, Suibei. On August 17, the Nationalist Party's army blew up two dikes in the Lantian area of Lanfeng County, causing the dikes in the liberated areas of Changyuan, Huaxian, and Puyang to be destroyed and flooded. On August 20, the People's Liberation Army annihilated the 36th Reorganized Division in the Huanglong Mountains of Shaanxi, turning the Northwest battlefield into an offensive. On August 23, the People's Liberation Army crossed the Yellow River in the Jinan front and advanced to the west of Henan. On August 24, the U.S. special envoy Wedemeyer left China. At the same time, he issued a statement insulting China and interfering in China's internal affairs, openly demanding that the Communist Party of China "stop using force." Wedemeyer arrived in China on July 22 and had visited Shanghai, Nanjing, Beijing, Tianjin, Hankou, Qingdao, Jinan, Shenyang, Guangzhou, Taiwan, and other places for inspections. On August 22, he attended the Nationalist Party's sellout government's secret cabinet meeting and gave a speech, which Chiang Kai-shek immediately agreed to. After Wedemeyer arrived in China, the U.S. sent more advisors to the Nationalist Party's sellout government and gained more bases in the Nationalist-controlled areas.

On September 5, Bai Chongxi issued a statement refuting the claim that "the Communist bandits cannot be completely eliminated," stating: "The government overthrew the Qing Dynasty in the Xinhai Revolution, completed the Northern Expedition, and won the War of Resistance, demonstrating its strength. Now that various parties have joined the government, its strength has increased even more, and the elimination of bandits is undoubtedly achievable." On September 8, the People's Liberation Army, which had advanced from Shandong, annihilated the 57th Reorganized Division in the south of Yuncheng, capturing the commander Shuan Ruimao, and crossed the Longhai Railway on September 26, advancing south to the Huai River. The People's Liberation Army's large-scale southward offensive changed the overall situation of the war. On September 14, the People's Liberation Army launched its autumn offensive in Northeast China. On September 17, the People's Liberation Army's Longhai West Line Campaign ended, annihilating 25,000 enemy troops and capturing 10 cities. On September 30, the Nationalist Party's army occupied Yantai. This was the peak of the Nationalist Party's army's concentrated offensive in Shandong since the spring, using about 80 divisions. The Nationalist Party's army in the Shandong liberated area committed atrocities, including killing and burning, and severe destruction.

From October 1 to 13, the People's Liberation Army attacked the outskirts of Luoyang, annihilating 6,000 enemy troops and capturing 8 cities. On October 1 to 2, the People's Liberation Army attacked the Changcheng section of the Beijing-Shenyang Railway, capturing 4 cities and annihilating two enemy divisions and one regiment. From October 3 to 9, the People's Liberation Army annihilated over 10,000 enemy troops in the south of Changyi, Shandong, turning the Shandong battlefield into an offensive. From this point on, the People's Liberation Army had shifted to the offensive on all fronts. On October 8, the People's Liberation Army attacked the Beijing-Baoding Line, and on October 22, in Qingfengdian south of Baoding, they annihilated over 10,000 troops of the Third Army, capturing the commander Lu Lisheng. On October 8, the People's Liberation Army annihilated one brigade in the east of Huoshan, Anhui. On October 27, in Gaochangpu, eastern Hubei, they annihilated two and a half brigades. On October 10, the People's Liberation Army issued a declaration and slogans, calling on the people of the whole country to cooperate with the People's Liberation Army to "overthrow Chiang Kai-shek and establish a new China." On the same day, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China promulgated the Land Law Outline, stipulating the abolition of the feudal and semi-feudal land system of exploitation and the implementation of the land system of "the tillers own the land." Since the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China issued the directive on implementing land reform on May 4, 1946, the land reform movement in the liberated areas had developed significantly. This movement became more widespread with the promulgation of the Land Law Outline of China. Within about a year after the promulgation of the Land Law Outline of China, approximately 100 million peasants in the Chinese liberated areas had obtained land. On the same day, the U.S. magazine Life published a proposal by the war profiteer Britt, which was to mobilize 400 million Chinese people under the command of MacArthur to fight against the Soviet Union for $135 million, "which is a great benefit to the United States." The Nationalist Party's sellout government welcomed Britt's proposal. On October 11, the People's Liberation Army captured Qingjian in Shaanxi, annihilating over 5,000 enemy troops and capturing the commander of the 76th Reorganized Division, Liao Ang. On October 17, the Nationalist Party's sellout government "informed" the U.S. government that it "welcomed" the continued stationing of American troops in Chinese territory. On October 27, the Nationalist Party's reactionary government dissolved the China Democratic League, marking the end of the illusion of the "middle road" of seeking peace, legality, and reform from the Nationalist Party's reactionary government. On October 29, Tao Xisheng, the deputy minister of the Nationalist Party's Propaganda Department, issued a statement slandering the China Democratic League as "traitors to the state" and "pests of humanity." He also said: "We hope that the security agencies will not allow them to escape the country and complete the last stroke of the epitaphs of Zheng Xiu and Zhao Xinhai." On the same day, the Nationalist Party's sellout government signed the "Sino-American Aid Agreement" with the U.S. government, which infringed upon China's economic, financial, trade, and resource sovereignty, providing $27 million in material aid to the Nationalist Party government to fight the civil war. On October 28, the Nationalist Party's special agents killed a student from Zhejiang University, Yu Zisan, sparking a new wave of anti-oppression and pro-freedom movements among students in the Nationalist-controlled areas. By the end of October and the beginning of November, tens of thousands of students in major cities such as Hangzhou, Beijing, Tianjin, Nanjing, Shanghai, Kunming, and Xiamen participated in strikes and demonstrations.

From November 1 to 29, the People's Liberation Army launched an offensive from the Longhai Line to the south, reaching the Tongbai Mountains, annihilating over 12,000 enemy troops in the entire campaign, and capturing the commander of the 15th Reorganized Division, Wu Tinglin. From November 9 to 19, the People's Liberation Army launched an offensive on the Xuzhou-Jinan section of the Longhai Railway, annihilating nearly 10,000 enemy troops. On November 5, the People's Liberation Army's autumn offensive in Northeast China ended, annihilating 69,000 enemy troops and capturing 15 cities in 50 days. On November 12, the People's Liberation Army liberated Shijiazhuang, annihilating over 22,000 enemy troops.

From December 8, the Nationalist Party's sellout government signed the "Naval Agreement" with the U.S. government, which infringed upon China's national defense, territorial, and maritime sovereignty, giving the U.S. the right to supervise the Chinese navy and to obtain naval bases in China. From December 13 to 16, the various armies in the Central Plains launched a joint attack on the Pinghan and Longhai railways, annihilating over 20,000 enemy troops and capturing 23 cities, including Xuchang. On December 15, the People's Liberation Army launched its winter offensive in Northeast China. On December 19, the U.S. Congress passed a $18 million temporary aid bill for the Nationalist Party government. On the same day, Li Zongren gave a speech stating: "The full-scale campaign against bandits in China will affect the world situation. In the future, we must review and improve the campaign against bandits at all times to achieve the ultimate victory." On December 22, the People's Liberation Army annihilated one brigade of the enemy in Liuheji, Longhai Line. On December 26, Mao Zedong, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, gave a report at the Central Committee meeting titled "The Current Situation and Our Tasks," pointing out that the People's Liberation War of China had completely shifted to the offensive, marking the turning point from the development to the elimination of Chiang Kai-shek's 20-year reactionary rule and the more than 100-year rule of imperialism in China. The report set out and reinterpreted the military, political, and economic policies of the Communist Party of China in the new situation. On December 26, the People's Liberation Army annihilated one reorganized division in the south of Xiping, Henan. From December 26 to 29, the People's Liberation Army annihilated 7,000 enemy troops in the area of Suining and Dongming.

In 1949,

On January 1, Chiang Kai-shek gave a New Year's Day broadcast, declaring that he would eliminate the Communist main forces within one to six months. On the same day, the Revolutionary Committee of the Nationalist Party was established in Hong Kong, issuing a declaration advocating the unity of the Communist Party of China and other democratic parties to overthrow Chiang Kai-shek's dictatorship and oppose the interference of American reactionaries in China's internal affairs. On January 5, leaders of the China Democratic League, including Shen Junru, held the Third Plenary Session of the China Democratic League in Hong Kong, deciding to rebuild the leadership of the China Democratic League, resume activities, and issue a declaration advocating the adoption of revolutionary methods to oppose the Nationalist Party's reactionary government and the U.S. policy towards China, and to cooperate with the Communist Party of China and other democratic parties.

On February 26, the People's Liberation Army recaptured Yingkou, with the commander of the 52nd Army's 58th Division, Wang Jiaxian, leading his troops to surrender.

From March 2 to 3, the People's Liberation Army achieved a great victory in Yichuan, Shaanxi, annihilating five brigades and killing the commander of the 29th Reorganized Army, Liu Jue. On March 9, the People's Liberation Army recaptured Yongji, the capital of Jilin Province.

On March 22, the People's Liberation Army captured Zichuan, annihilating 12,000 enemy troops. On March 25, the Nationalist Party government promulgated the "Organization of Special Criminal Courts," using fascist "special courts" to persecute patriotic democrats. To pass this regulation, Sun Ke stated in the fake Legislative Yuan: "The establishment of special criminal courts is to punish the Communist bandits. Today, we no longer allow any sympathy for the Communist bandits. Those who sympathize with the Communist bandits should leave!" On March 29 to May 1, the Nationalist Party's reactionary clique held a fake "Constitutional National Assembly," with Chiang Kai-shek and Li Zongren serving as the fake president and vice president, respectively. Li Zongren's appointment as the fake vice president was at the behest of the U.S. government and received praise from American imperialist public opinion. The U.S. government, seeing the worsening situation of the Nationalist Party in the war, prepared to use another Chinese reactionary leader and American agent, Li Zongren, with the facade of "anti-Chiang," to deceive the Chinese people and preserve the reactionary forces. On March 30, Li Zongren, while in Shanghai on March 22, told reporters: "I fully agree with MacArthur's opinion that military resolution is the most important before implementing other reforms. After being elected vice president, I will definitely assist the future president in 'suppressing bandits.'" On March 31, the People's Liberation Army recaptured Weihaiwei.

On April 1, Mao Zedong, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, gave a speech at the Jin-Sui cadre meeting, reaffirming the general line of the Communist Party of China in the current historical stage: "The revolution led by the proletariat, the people's masses, against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism," and the general line of the Communist Party of China in land reform work: "Relying on the poor peasants, uniting the middle peasants, and gradually and differentially eliminating the feudal system of exploitation to develop agricultural production." On April 3, the U.S. Congress passed a $463 million "aid to China" bill (reduced to $400 million on June 19). By this time, the total value of loans, materials, and services provided by American imperialism to the Nationalist Party's reactionary government to fight the civil war after Japan's surrender was $4.34 billion. On April 9, Chiang Kai-shek gave a speech at the fake National Assembly, stating: "I will definitely eliminate the bandit forces in southern China within three to six months." On April 22, the People's Liberation Army recaptured Yan'an. On April 23, the People's Liberation Army recaptured Duolun in Chahar. On April 27, the People's Liberation Army captured Weifang, annihilating 25,000 enemy troops and capturing the commander of the 96th Army, Chen Jinceng. In April, the anti-oppression and anti-hunger strike and boycott movement in the education sector in the Nationalist-controlled areas expanded, spreading to more than ten cities, including Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Nanjing, and Chengdu.

On May 1, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China issued a call to commemorate May Day, calling for the convening of a new Political Consultative Conference without the participation of reactionaries to discuss the establishment of a democratic coalition government. On May 4, 120 overseas Chinese organizations in Singapore issued a telegram supporting the convening of a new Political Consultative Conference. On May 5, the Revolutionary Committee of the Nationalist Party, the China Democratic League, the China Democratic Promotion Association, the China Zhi Gong Party, the China Democratic Peasants and Workers Party, the China People's Salvation Association, the China Nationalist Party Democratic Promotion Association, and the Three Principles of the People's Comrades Association, along with other democratic parties and personages, issued a telegram supporting the convening of a new Political Consultative Conference. On May 8, the Huadong People's Liberation Army's spring offensive on the Jiaoji Line ended, annihilating over 90,000 enemy troops and capturing 17 cities, making the area east of the Tianpu Railway in Shandong, except for a few enemy strongholds such as Qingdao, Yantai, and Linyi, completely liberated. From May 17 to 18, the one-month-long People's Liberation Army's Zhongyuan Daling and Wei River Campaign ended, annihilating over 19,000 enemy troops. On May 18, the People's Liberation Army captured Linfen, annihilating 25,000 enemy troops and capturing the deputy commander of the Sixth Army Group of Yan Xishan's forces, Liang Peihuan. On May 19, Li Zongren gave a speech on the eve of his inauguration as the fake vice president, stating: "I hope that the whole country will unite under the leadership of Chairman Chiang in the future to eliminate internal turmoil." On May 22, over 10,000 students from various universities in Shanghai held a rally, launching a patriotic movement against American support for the revival of Japanese aggression. This movement quickly spread to major cities across the country, with Shanghai, Beijing, Wuhan, Chengdu, Kunming, and other places holding demonstrations with tens of thousands of participants. The Nationalist Party's reactionary and sellout government violently suppressed and sabotaged this patriotic movement, sending large numbers of military police to prevent student demonstrations in various major cities, and arresting and beating patriotic students. The Central Daily News published editorials calling for the "elimination of the disabled to avoid trouble" and "immediate and decisive action to root out the weeds." The spokesperson of the Nationalist Party's Central Propaganda Department publicly called on all Nationalist Party reactionaries to "fight to the death" with patriotic students. On May 25, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China issued a directive on "Land Reform and Party Rectification Work in 1948." In late May, the People's Liberation Army launched an offensive on the Tianpu Line between Xuzhou and Jinan. In late May, the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu and Jin-Cha-Ji liberated areas merged to form the North China liberated area.

On June 2, the People's Liberation Army annihilated the headquarters of the 58th Reorganized Division and one of its brigades near Nanyang. On June 4, the American imperialist agent Stuart issued a statement, openly interfering in the patriotic movement of Chinese students against American support for Japan, slandering the student patriotic movement as a "conspiracy," "mistake," and "wrong path," and threatening students with "unfortunate consequences" to stop this patriotic movement. In addition, the U.S. Consul General in Shanghai, Carpentier, gave speeches in April and May, stating that American support for Japan was a duty, and that the opposition to American support for Japan was due to the deception of villains, and that the Chinese students and people who benefited from American aid had no right to oppose American policy. Stuart, Carpentier, and others' shameless interference in the patriotic movement of Chinese students aroused the indignation of the Chinese people. But the American running dog Hu Shi expressed his "agreement" with Stuart's statement on June 5. On the same day, the first fake "Constitutional Cabinet" of the Nationalist Party's reactionary government, headed by Weng Wenhao, was formed. On June 11, the People's Liberation Army recaptured Qufu, annihilating over 10,000 enemy troops. On June 16, the People's Liberation Army captured Kaifeng, annihilating over 30,000 enemy troops. The Nationalist Party government carried out brutal arson and bombing in Kaifeng, killing and injuring tens of thousands of civilians, provoking the opposition of the people across the country. On June 25, He Yingqin reported to the fake Legislative Yuan that "we must have confidence and accept all good advice to eliminate the Communist bandits as soon as possible." On June 28, Bai Chongxi gave a speech stating: "Today, the bandit situation is rampant, and the whole country must make a firm decision to prioritize the campaign against bandits to achieve results." From July 1, 1947, to the end of June, in the second year of the People's Liberation War, the People's Liberation Army annihilated 94.5 enemy regular divisions (including 50 whole divisions), totaling over 1.52 million enemy troops, and liberated and recaptured 155,000 square kilometers of land, 164 important cities and counties, and 37 million people, restoring the liberated areas to 2.355 million square kilometers (35,000 square kilometers less than at the start of the civil war), increasing the population to 106.8 million (19 million more than at the start of the civil war), and increasing the number of cities to 586 (80 more than at the start of the civil war). The Nationalist Party's army was reduced to 3.65 million, while the People's Liberation Army increased to 2.8 million.

On July 3, the Nationalist Party's sellout government signed the "Sino-American Bilateral Agreement" with the U.S. government, which infringed upon China's economic, financial, trade, and resource sovereignty. On July 5, the Nationalist Party's reactionary government massacred students from Northeast China in Beijing, killing 18 and injuring 24. On July 6, the People's Liberation Army, following the victory in Kaifeng, achieved another great victory in the area of Suixian and Xianxian, Shandong, annihilating over 50,000 enemy troops and capturing the commander of the Army Group, Qu Shounian. On July 9, Li Zongren told the Associated Press that he opposed Sino-Soviet friendship, stating: "The Soviet Union has no right to demand that the Chinese government comply with any provisions in any Sino-Soviet agreement," and "I am convinced that the Soviet Union will never fulfill the terms of the treaty." On July 10, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China issued a resolution on the issue of the Yugoslav Communist Party, agreeing with the resolution of the Communist Information Bureau on the issue of the Yugoslav Communist Party, and calling on the whole party to strengthen party, class, internationalist, self-criticism, and discipline education. On July 13, the People's Liberation Army captured Jiujiang, annihilating 27,000 enemy troops and capturing the commander of the 12th Reorganized Army, Hu Shouyi.

On July 15, the Nationalist Party's reactionary government massacred students in Kunming, killing and injuring over 100 people.

On July 24, Weng Wenhao gave a broadcast in Nanjing to the domestic and international community, calling for the strengthening of the campaign against bandits, stating: "We must unite the strength of the whole country to shoulder the sacred task of suppressing bandits and saving the country." Due to the failure of the Nationalist Party's reactionary government in the counter-revolutionary war, American imperialist elements instigated a group of Nationalist Party reactionaries led by Li Zongren to engage in fake peace activities to preserve the shaky Nationalist Party reactionary forces; however, the hardline Nationalist Party elements who continued to fight were also alarmed, so Weng Wenhao gave this broadcast. On the same day, Li Zongren denied rumors, stating: "Anyone who believes and spreads rumors is unreasonable. There is currently no basis for talks with the Communist Party." On July 25, the Nationalist Party's reactionary government dissolved the China Democratic League, marking the end of the illusion of the "middle road" of seeking peace, legality, and reform from the Nationalist Party's reactionary government.

I will not abandon the responsibility of suppressing bandits, so I must lead my comrades to struggle hard to complete the task of suppressing bandits and building the country." On August 5, the Nationalist Party's sellout government signed an agreement with the U.S. government to establish the so-called "Sino-American Joint Committee for Rural Reconstruction," which sold out China's agricultural sovereignty. On August 7, the North China People's Congress opened, closing on August 19, electing the North China People's Government.

On August 17, the Nationalist Party government issued an order to arrest patriotic students and other democrats in various major cities in the Nationalist-controlled areas, carrying out large-scale arrests. On August 19, the Nationalist Party government "reformed the currency," issuing fake gold yuan and implementing unprecedented inflation, while also implementing forced price controls, forcibly seizing gold, silver, and foreign currency from the people, and further plundering the people. From August 22 to September 17, Nationalist Party aircraft continuously bombed Shijiazhuang, killing and injuring over 160 civilians.

On September 3, Xinhua News Agency refuted the "peace rumors" and exposed that certain American imperialist elements, seeing the deepening military crisis of the Nationalist Party reactionaries, attempted to use Li Zongren, He Yingqin, and other reactionary military and political cliques to deceive the Chinese people with the facade of "peace," thereby preserving the remnants of the Nationalist Party reactionary forces and American imperialist forces in China.

From October 6 to 13, the People's Liberation Army achieved two great victories in the Weibei area of Shaanxi, annihilating over 17,000 enemy troops. On October 15, the People's Liberation Army captured Jinzhou, annihilating over 120,000 enemy troops and capturing the deputy commander of the Northeast "Pacification Headquarters," Fan Hanjie.

In late October, Chiang Kai-shek discussed with Fu Zuoyi in Beijing to launch a surprise attack on Shijiazhuang, hoping to boost morale, but this plot failed under the blows of the People's Liberation Army. In early October, large-scale panic buying occurred in more than 20 major cities in the Nationalist-controlled areas, and the fake gold yuan immediately depreciated sharply.

On November 1, the headquarters of the People's Liberation Army issued an order to punish war criminals, stating that all Nationalist Party military officers and party and government officials at various levels who ordered their subordinates to commit atrocities such as massacring people, using poison gas, destroying buildings, and destroying property would be considered war criminals; those who led the execution of the above-mentioned atrocities would also be punished according to law; those who took effective measures to ensure the safety of people's lives and property, cities, buildings, and property would be rewarded. On the same day, the Nationalist Party government was forced to abolish the policy of forced price controls. After the abolition of price controls, prices in the Nationalist-controlled areas soared even more, and large-scale riots and strikes occurred in Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, and other places, with over 100,000 workers in Shanghai alone going on strike. Under this pressure, the Nationalist Party government announced the "revised" currency reform plan on November 11, declaring the complete failure of the original "currency reform" plan. On November 2, Shenyang was liberated, and all enemy troops were annihilated. Thus, the 50-day autumn offensive of the Northeast People's Liberation Army ended in victory, annihilating 470,000 enemy troops in Northeast China. The entire Northeast region was liberated. On November 4, the People's Liberation Army liberated Nanyang. On November 6, the People's Liberation Army launched the Huaihai Campaign.

On November 8, the deputy commander of the Third Pacification Zone, He Jidong, and Zhang Keshi led 20,000 troops to surrender in the front line of Xuzhou. On the same day, Chiang Kai-shek gave a speech at the Nationalist Party's Central Party Affairs Week, denouncing those who advocate peace, stating: "Today, these people ignore the interests of the state, lose the stance of the people, respond to the Communist bandits' propaganda offensive, and advocate surrendering to the Communist bandits. This not only makes them willing to be slaves of the Communist bandits but also harms our entire Chinese nation to be slaves of foreigners forever." "The Nationalist Party's policy of suppressing bandits has been determined and will be carried out to the end. Currently, all peace rumors are only to support the Communist bandits' propaganda offensive and will not affect our government and military and civilian comrades' determination to eliminate the bandits." "My personal attitude towards doing things is that if I don't start, I won't; once I start, I will definitely seek success; I will not easily take on any responsibility, but once I take on a responsibility, I will definitely be responsible to the end; especially in the past 30 years, I have never decided on any battle without careful consideration, and once I decide, I will fight to the end regardless of any setbacks, difficulties, and failures." On the same day, Bai Chongxi gave a speech at the Central China Pacification Headquarters, stating: "We should carry forward the revolutionary spirit, enhance the will to fight, and thoroughly implement total war." On November 12, the People's Liberation Army recaptured Chengde. On November 14, a responsible person from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China announced that the People's Liberation War had entered a new turning point. Due to the results of the battles of Suixian, Xianxian, Jinan, Jinzhou, Changchun, Liaoxi, Shenyang, and others, the total number of the People's Liberation Army quickly increased to over 3 million, while the Nationalist Party's army quickly decreased to about 2.9 million, thus the People's Liberation Army had also numerically surpassed the Nationalist Party's army. This is a sign that the success of the Chinese revolution and the realization of peace in China are approaching. From November 15 to 28, the People's Liberation Army achieved three consecutive victories in the area of Luohe River in Shaanxi, annihilating over 30,000 enemy troops and capturing the commander of the 76th Army, Li Ribao. On November 20, the Nationalist Party's reactionary warlord Hu Shi gave a speech at the Nationalist Party's North China "Pacification Headquarters" meeting, stating: "Peace is a thousand times more difficult than war, and talking to the Communist Party is a fantasy." He urged the Nationalist Party reactionaries to "hold on and wait for change," and continue the war to the end. Hu Shi also told the Associated Press reporter on the same day that he requested American aid for Fu Zuoyi's war. On November 21, Song Meiling broadcasted to the United States, stating: "I can assure American friends that we will continue the righteous war of suppressing the communists. The president (referring to Chiang Kai-shek) and I, as long as we are alive, will definitely fight to the end to eliminate the threat of the evil communists." and begged the U.S. government for aid. On November 22, the People's Liberation Army completely annihilated the 10 divisions of the Huang Bingtou Army Group east of Xuzhou.

On November 24, the People's Liberation Army completely surrounded the Huang Wei Army Group in the southwest of Suixian, and the commander of the 101st Division of the 85th Army, Liao Yunzhou, led his troops to surrender. On the same day, the People's Liberation Army liberated Baoding. On November 26, the fake administrative cabinet of the Nationalist Party's reactionary government headed by Weng Wenhao collapsed, and Sun Ke took over as the fake premier.

In 1949,

On January 1, Xinhua News Agency published an editorial titled "Carrying the Revolution to the End," exposing the Nationalist Party's reactionary clique and American imperialism's fake peace plot and the plot to organize an "opposition" in the revolutionary camp, calling on the people of the whole country and various democratic parties to unite more closely under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, thoroughly eliminate the reactionary forces, and carry the revolution to the end. On the same day, Chiang Kai-shek issued a peace appeal, proposing to negotiate "peace" with the Communist Party of China under the conditions of preserving the fake constitution, fake constitutional government, and preserving the Nationalist Party's reactionary army, attempting to use the fake peace plot to gain breathing room, reorganize forces, and counterattack the revolutionary forces. Xinhua News Agency's reporter issued a commentary on January 5, severely denouncing it. On January 1, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China issued a resolution on "Establishing the New Democratic Youth League of China" and published the "Draft Constitution of the New Democratic Youth League of China." On January 8, the Nationalist Party government requested mediation from the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union in the Chinese civil war, attempting to let foreign countries interfere in China's internal affairs. On January 17, the Soviet government replied to the Nationalist Party government, refusing to participate in the mediation of the Chinese civil war. On January 24, the spokesperson of the Nationalist Party government admitted that the United States, Britain, France, and the Soviet Union had all refused to mediate the Chinese civil war. On January 10, the People's Liberation Army completely annihilated the 8 divisions of the 21st Army of Qiu Qingquan and Li Mi and the remnants of the Sun Yuran Army in the northeast of Yongcheng, capturing the war criminal and deputy commander of the Xuzhou "Pacification Headquarters," Du Yuming, who refused to surrender and used poison gas, and killing the commander of the Army Group, Qiu Qingquan. Thus, the great Huaihai Campaign ended in complete victory, annihilating 600,000 enemy troops, including 57 whole divisions. On January 12, Nationalist Party aircraft indiscriminately bombed Jinan, killing and injuring over 140 civilians, and on the next day, they bombed Xuzhou, killing and injuring over 30 civilians. On January 14, Mao Zedong, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, issued a statement on the situation, proposing: In order to quickly end the war, achieve true peace, and reduce the suffering of the people, the Communist Party of China is willing to negotiate peace with the Nationalist Party's reactionary government in Nanjing and other Nationalist Party local governments and military cliques on the basis of eight conditions: (1) Punish war criminals; (2) Abolish the fake constitution; (3) Abolish the fake constitutional government; (4) Reorganize all reactionary armies according to democratic principles; (5) Confiscate bureaucratic capital; (6) Reform the land system; (7) Abolish treasonous treaties; (8) Convene a political consultative conference without the participation of reactionaries to establish a democratic coalition government and take over all power of the Nationalist Party's reactionary government and its subordinate governments at all levels. This statement was warmly supported by the people of the whole country and various democratic parties. On January 15, the People's Liberation Army liberated Tianjin, annihilating over 130,000 enemy troops and capturing the commander of the Tianjin Nationalist Party Garrison, Chen Changjie, and the fake mayor, Du Jianshi, and others. Before the People's Liberation Army began the attack on Tianjin on January 14, they had advised the Nationalist Party army in Tianjin to lay down their arms to avoid the destruction of Tianjin, but Chen Changjie and others rejected the advice of the People's Liberation Army and committed the crime of ordering the complete burning of more than ten villages in the suburbs of Tianjin, causing tens of thousands of people to become homeless and starving. On January 17, the People's Liberation Army liberated Tanggu. On January 19, the fake administrative council of the Nationalist Party's reactionary government decided to request an "unconditional ceasefire first," while ignoring the Communist Party's eight conditions, proving that the Nationalist Party government had no sincere intention of peace. The spokesperson of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China issued a statement on January 21, severely denouncing it. On January 20 and 21, the People's Liberation Army liberated Bangbu and Hefei.

On January 21, the fake president of the Nationalist Party's reactionary government, Chiang Kai-shek, announced his "resignation" due to illness and handed over his duties to the fake vice president, Li Zongren, to act as president. Chiang Kai-shek flew from Nanjing to Fenghua and retreated to the background to direct operations. Before Chiang Kai-shek's "resignation," he had planned to use "peace talks" to gain three to six months of time to reorganize the Nationalist Party army in southern Jiangnan. On January 22, Li Zongren issued a proclamation, stating: "The eight conditions proposed by the Communist Party are acceptable for immediate negotiations." Li Zongren said in the proclamation: "After eight years of resistance and three years of civil war, not only was the possibility of national revival after the victory of the resistance war destroyed, but the war spread throughout the Yellow River, destroying fields and homes, and causing countless innocent people to be killed and injured. This unprecedented catastrophe in the history of Chinese civil war is indeed the responsibility of the Nationalist Party's reactionary government." Li Zongren here actually admitted the responsibility of the Nationalist Party's reactionary government for the war. However, Li Zongren's actions still did not go beyond the attempt to preserve the remnants of the American invaders and the Nationalist Party's reactionary forces. On the same day, 55 representatives of various democratic parties, people's organizations, and other democrats who arrived in the liberated areas, including Li Jishen, Shen Junru, Ma Xulun, Guo Moruo, and others, issued a statement on the situation, expressing their firm support for the eight peace conditions proposed by the Communist Party on January 14, opposing the Nationalist Party's reactionary government's fake "peace" plot, and stating their willingness to unite under the leadership of the Communist Party to carry the revolution to the end.

The spokesperson of the Communist Party issued a statement on January 28, ordering the Nationalist Party's reactionary government to immediately re-arrest Kaneko and other Japanese war criminals, and stated that the Chinese people reserved the right to re-trial all Japanese war criminals released by MacArthur's headquarters in Tokyo in the future. But the Nationalist Party's sellout government still sent Kaneko Ryunosuke and other 260 Japanese war criminals to Japan on January 31. On January 29, the fake Minister of Defense, Gu Zhenrong, issued a secret order to the Nationalist Party's reactionary army, stating: "We must make the greatest effort to defend the state, the nation, and the party and army's survival, and be determined to fight to the end with the Communist Party, and resolutely carry out a long-term self-rescue, self-defense, and national salvation war." Bai Chongxi forwarded this order to his subordinates on February 4, which was seized by the People's Liberation Army. On January 31, the People's Liberation Army liberated Beijing. The commander of the Nationalist Party's North China Pacification Headquarters, Fu Zuoyi, led 250,000 troops to accept the request of the People's Liberation Army on the Pingjin front to withdraw from the city on January 22 and await reorganization. The liberation of Beijing was one of the most important military and political developments in the great Chinese people's revolutionary movement, and was the first example of ending the war according to the Communist Party's eight peace conditions. Fu Zuoyi's actions of seeking forgiveness for his past crimes in peacefully resolving the Beijing issue gained the understanding of the people. In January, the People's Liberation Army annihilated and reorganized 628,000 enemy troops, including 61 whole divisions, liberated 9.6 million people, 20,000 square kilometers of land, and 39 cities.

On February 5, the spokesperson of the Communist Party stated that the first condition of the eight peace conditions should include the punishment of Japanese war criminals and domestic war criminals.

On February 9, the director of the Political Affairs Bureau of the fake National Defense Department, Deng Wenyi, issued a statement, stating: "We will not hesitate to sacrifice everything and fight to the end with the Communist Party." On February 13, the Central Propaganda Department of the Nationalist Party issued a "special propaganda directive," ordering local propaganda to "govern without unconditional surrender, rather than fight to the end," and "Mao Zedong's January 14 statement is a condition for national surrender, which the government should not accept." On February 12, the fake governor of Yunnan, Lu Han, and the police in Kunming killed 21 civilians in front of the Central Bank who were exchanging the fake gold yuan declared as counterfeit by the bank.

On February 14, Yan Huichang, Shaoli Zi, Zhang Shizhao, Jiang Yong, and Huang Qihan flew to Beijing as private individuals to discuss state affairs with the Communist Party side, and on February 22, they flew to Shijiazhuang and were received by Mao Zedong, Chairman of the Communist Party, and General Zhu De, exchanging views on a wide range of issues, including peace talks and north-south communication and mail. On February 15, the original Jin-Sui liberated area and the Shaan-Gan-Ning liberated area merged. On February 23, the fake administrative council of the Nationalist Party's reactionary government in Guangzhou passed the "Financial and Economic Reform Case," stipulating that silver dollars and so-called "customs dollars" would be used as the calculation units for military expenditures and customs duties, some commodity taxes and salt taxes would be changed to real goods, and local governments would be allowed to levy taxes freely, etc. In essence, it was a declaration of the complete failure of the fake gold yuan and the adoption of direct plunder of the people's cash and real goods, as well as the permission for various local governments to levy unlimited taxes. On February 25, 35 democrats, including Li Jishen, Shen Junru, Ma Xulun, and Guo Moruo, arrived in Beijing from Northeast China, welcomed by the responsible person of the Communist Party in Beijing. On the next day, the responsible person of the Communist Party in Beijing held a grand welcome ceremony for the democrats from all sides.

From March 1 to 3, the negotiations on communication between the North China liberated area and the Nationalist-controlled area were successfully concluded in Beijing and Tianjin. On March 1, MacArthur issued a ridiculous statement that "Taiwan belongs to the Allied Command before the signing of the peace treaty with Japan," and instructed Taiwan to issue a call for "independence" under the guise of the Taiwanese people's organization, led by the American spy Liao Wenyi, in an attempt to occupy China's territory, Taiwan Province.

From March 14 to 28, due to the severe famine caused by the Nationalist Party's reactionary rule, students, teachers, and school workers in various places in the Nationalist-controlled areas held anti-hunger struggles. On March 18, Xinhua News Agency published an editorial, responding to the call for the World Peace Conference, and pointed out: If the adventurous elements of the imperialist countries dare to provoke a new world war, the Chinese people will carry out the instructions in Sun Yat-sen's letter to the Soviet Union: China and the Soviet Union will "advance together to achieve victory." On March 19, American imperialists and the Nationalist Party's reactionary and sellout government dispatched B-29 heavy bombers with American emblems to bomb the cruiser Chongqing, which had mutinied on January 25 and arrived in Northeast China's Lüshun on February 4. On the same day, the U.S. Navy also dispatched three submarines to the waters of Lüshun to prevent the Chongqing from moving elsewhere. The action of the American imperialists once again directly violated China's air and sea sovereignty and directly participated in the counter-revolutionary civil war of the Nationalist Party's reactionary government. On March 25, the Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou Garrison Command prohibited the sale of 185 newspapers and magazines from Hong Kong and other places.

The plenary session pointed out: The party's work focus has shifted from the countryside to the cities, and all party members must strive to learn industrial production technology and production management methods, and learn commercial work, banking work, and other work closely related to production. The plenary session pointed out: The party must seriously unite the entire working class, the entire peasant class, and a large number of revolutionary intellectuals to form the leading force and foundation of the people's democratic dictatorship led by the proletariat and based on the worker-peasant alliance. At the same time, it is necessary to unite as many representatives of the petty bourgeoisie and the free bourgeoisie who can cooperate with the Communist Party as possible, their intellectuals and political factions, to jointly overthrow the domestic reactionary forces and imperialist forces, quickly restore and develop production, and thus create conditions for China to gradually transform from an agricultural country to an industrial country, and from a new democratic country to a socialist country. On March 25, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the headquarters of the People's Liberation Army moved to Beijing.

On March 26, the delegation to the Paris World Peace Conference selected by various people's organizations in China was established in Beijing, with Guo Moruo as the head, Liu Ningyi and Ma Yinchu as deputy heads, and Qian Junrui as the secretary-general. The delegation departed for Paris on March 29. On March 26, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China decided to appoint Zhou Enlai, Lin Boqu, Lin Biao, Ye Jianying, and Li Weihan as representatives for peace talks (adding Nie Rongzhen as a representative on April 1), with Zhou Enlai as the chief representative, based on the eight peace conditions proposed by Mao Zedong on January 14, to conduct peace talks with the representatives of the Nationalist Party's reactionary government from April 1 in Beijing, and notified the Nationalist Party's reactionary government through the radio station to send its representatives to the designated time and place, bringing the necessary materials for the eight conditions to facilitate the talks. The Nationalist Party's reactionary government appointed Shaoli Zi, Zhang Zhongliang, Huang Shaojun, Zhang Shizhao, Li Zhen, and Liu Fei as representatives for talks, with Zhang Zhongliang as the chief representative, and arrived in Beijing on April 1. It is worth noting that: First, Zhang Zhongliang, on March 29, specially received instructions from Li Zongren and He Yingqin to fly to Fenghua to see the first-class war criminal and public enemy, Chiang Kai-shek, to "request instructions." Second, the Zhang Zhongliang delegation arrived in Beijing on April 1, and the 6,000 patriotic students in Nanjing who sent them off were brutally beaten by the military police and special agents of the Nationalist Party, with over 200 people killed, injured, or missing. These two incidents show that up to now, the Nationalist Party's reactionary and sellout government only wanted to use peace talks to raise its price and preserve the reactionary forces, and had no sincere intention of repenting and reforming, seeking forgiveness, and accepting the Communist Party's eight peace conditions to achieve true peace. Mao Zedong, Chairman, had anticipated this situation in his January 14 statement, so he said at the end of the statement: "All commanding officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, pay attention: Before the Nationalist Party's reactionary government in Nanjing accepts and implements true democratic peace, you must not relax your fighting efforts in the slightest. For any daring rebels, you must annihilate them completely and thoroughly."

　　什么人应负战争责任？
  　日本投降以来大事月表（之一）
    新华社
    编者按：当南京国民党反动卖国政府的和谈代表团来到北平，与中国共产党举行和平谈判的时候，全国人民最注意的一个问题，就是国民党反动卖国政府及其代表团对于战争的责任问题将取何种态度。南京的李宗仁何应钦政府虽然在口头上说愿以中共八项和平条件为谈判基础，在事实上却至今拒绝与应对战争负最大责任的蒋介石反动集团和美国帝国主义政府决裂，至今还继续担任蒋介石反动集团和美国帝国主义政府的反革命工具，而这当然是与按照中共八项条件实现真和平的路线绝对不可调和的。南京的国民党反动卖国政府，显然还不愿承认自己对于发动反人民战争的全部责任。为了帮助全国人民掌握关于战争责任问题的系统材料，也为了帮助国民党反动卖国政府回忆它自己及其主人美国帝国主义政府的无可抵赖的滔天罪恶，本社特将自日本投降以来迄今的四十四个月（一九四五年八月至一九四九年三月）中的中国大事，编为以下的大事月表。人们看了这些真凭实据，对于今天国民党反动卖国政府及其主人美国帝国主义的花言巧语，就不难知道应当怎样去判断其价值；而对于企图抵赖和掩饰自己及其主人的罪恶的骗子们，也不难知道应当怎样去加以揭穿了。
    一九四五年
    八月八日，苏联对日宣战。苏军进入东北境内歼灭了日本陆军的主力，俘日军五十一万人，决定地促成了日本的崩溃和投降。九日，中共毛泽东主席发表声明称：“由于苏联的这一行动，最后地战胜日本侵略者及其一切走狗的时间已经到来了。八路军、新四军及其他人民军队，应在一切可能条件下，对于一切不愿投降的侵略者及其走狗实行广泛的进攻，歼灭这些敌人的有生力量，夺取其武器与资财，猛烈地扩大解放区，缩小沦陷区。……全国人民必须注意制止内战危险，努力促成民主的联合政府之建立。”十日，日本政府宣布要求投降。同日，人民解放军朱德总司令下令华北华中华南各战区人民解放军应迅速前进收缴敌伪武装，接受日军投降，并令原在冀热辽边区抗击日军的解放军和其他部队，迅速深入东北，配合苏军收复全东北。十一日，国民党卖国政府主席蒋介石“命令”朱德总司令，“所有该集团军所属部队，应就地驻防待命”，不得向敌伪“擅自行动”。另令伪军“负责维持治安”，抵抗人民解放军受降。按：此时人民解放军抗击着侵华日军的百分之六十九，伪军的百分之九十五，华北华中各城市和华南的若干城市均为人民解放军所长期包围，而消极抗日的国民党军队的绝大部分都躲在中国的西南部和西北部，忙于准备反人民的内战。蒋介石的这个荒谬命令表示国民党反动派决心夺取中国人民八年奋斗的果实，使中国仍然回到抗日战争以前的半封建半殖民地的黑暗状态。十三日，人民解放军朱德总司令和彭德怀副总司令致电蒋介石，坚决拒绝蒋介石十一日的命令：“因为你给我们的这个命令，不但不公道，而且违背中华民族的民族利益，仅仅有利于日本侵略者及背叛祖国的汉奸们。”人民解放军继续向日寇汉奸作坚决的进攻，因而收复了广大的国土和大批的城市，但是国民党反动政府则指挥其军队又从人民解放军手中实行所谓“收复失地”。十四日，中苏友好同盟条约签字。该约规定苏军进入东北消灭日本军队，与中国军队合作，直至获得最后胜利为止。该约规定中苏两国在对日战事终止后，不得单独与日本政府缔结和约，并须采取一切措施，使日本无再事侵略及破坏和平之可能。为了共同防御远东方面的侵略，该约附件规定中苏两国共同使用旅顺海军根据地，而在对日作战期间，大连亦包括在该根据地范围内。此约对于消灭日本关东军和维护远东和平均有重大作用。同日，日皇宣告正式接受无条件投降。十五日，人民解放军朱德总司令向美英苏三国驻华大使送出给三国政府说帖一件，声明：（一）中国国民党政府及其统帅部，在接受日伪投降与缔结受降后的一切协定和条约时，不能代表中国解放区、中国沦陷区广大人民及一切真正抗日的人民武装力量。如协定及条约中，有涉及中国解放区、中国沦陷区一切真正抗日的人民武装力量之处，而又未事先取得我们的同意时，我们将保留自己的发言权。（二）中国解放区、中国沦陷区一切抗日的人民武装力量，在延安总部指挥之下，有权根据波茨坦宣言条款及同盟国规定之受降办法，接受被我军所包围之日伪军队的投降，收缴其武器资财，并负责实施同盟国在受降后之一切规定。（三）中国解放区、中国沦陷区的广大人民及一切抗日的人民武装力量，应有权派遣自己的代表参加同盟国接受敌国的投降和处理敌国投降后的工作。（四）中国解放区及其一切抗日武装力量应有权选出自己的代表团，参加将来关于处理日本的和平会议及联合国会议。（五）为减少中国的内战危险，请美利坚合众国政府站在中美两国人民的共同利益上，立即停止对于中国国民党政府之租借法案的继续执行。如果国民党政府发动反对中国人民的全国规模的内战（此种内战危险，现已极其严重）请勿予国民党政府援助。廿三日，国民党反动政府陆军总司令何应钦在南京命令侵华日军总司令冈村宁次称：“甲、中国境内之非法武装组织，擅自向日军追求收缴武器，在蒋委员长或何总司令指定之国军接收前，应负责作有效之防卫。乙、现股匪攻开封、天津、郑州等地……关于此事，目前应特别注意，并应依中字第四号备忘录，迅即将指定之日军，集中于上述股匪进攻之地方及其他各地，作有效之防卫。如果各地……为股匪所占领，日军应负责任，并应由日军将其收回。”在这里，国民党卖国政府公然和日本侵略者站在一起，反对它所污蔑为“股匪”的人民解放军。国民党卖国政府不但不许人民解放军向日寇收复失地，而且进一步命令日寇向人民解放军“收复失地”了。二十五日，中国共产党中央委员会发表时局宣言。虽然如前所述，国民党反动政府在日寇刚一投降后便如此倒行逆施，加紧准备全面内战，但是中共中央在这个对时局宣言中仍然表示了最后地挽救国内和平的迫切愿望。宣言说：“抗战胜利了，新的和平建设时期开始了，我们必须坚持和平、民主、团结，为独立自由与富强的新中国而奋斗。”宣言中要求国民党政府实行以下的紧急措施，以奠立今后和平建设的基础：“（一）承认解放区的民选政府和抗日军队，撤退包围与进攻解放区的军队，以便立即实现和平，避免内战。（二）划定八路军、新四军及华南抗日纵队接受日军投降的地区，并给予他们以参加处置日本的一切工作的权利，以昭公允。（三）严惩汉奸，解散伪军。（四）公平合理的整编军队，办理复员，救济难胞，减轻赋税以苏民困。（五）承认各党派合法地位，取消一切妨碍人民集会结社言论出版自由的法令，取消特务机关，释放爱国政治犯。（六）立即召开各党派及无党派代表人物的会议，商讨抗战结束后的各项重大问题，制定民主的施政纲领，结束训政，成立举国一致的民主联合政府，并筹备自由无拘束的普选的国民大会。”
    二十八日，为了努力避免内战，中共中央毛泽东主席飞重庆与国民党政府当局进行实现和平民主团结的谈判。二十九日，何应钦密令各战区印发蒋介石在一九二七年至一九三六年反人民内战期间所编辑的反动文件“剿匪手册”。这是蒋介石、何应钦等伪称要求和平实则决心内战的又一实证。
    九月十日，人民解放军击退东侵至张家口外围之傅作义部国民党军。抗日战争期间傅部主力均集中于绥西陕坝一带，人民解放军则在日本投降前后即解放包头以东之绥远和察哈尔的大部土地。人民解放军缴获傅部暂三军副军长刘万春九月二十三日致其内部的电报中称：“自我军东进以来，部队骚动地方，甚至奸淫抢掠，纪律荡然，以致民怨沸腾。”三十日，侵华美军在天津登陆。美国军事力量不在抗日战争期间而在日本投降以后在中国海岸登陆，这是无可掩饰的侵略中国领土主权和干涉中国内政的行为。美国政府辩称这是为了协助中国的受降和遣俘，事实证明这只是破坏中国的受降和遣俘。美国政府的真正意图是帮助它的走狗国民党反动政府在反人民的内战中取得优势，以便变中国为美国的殖民地。美军登陆天津以后，即在塘沽、秦皇岛等地自由进出，率同国民党军侵占冀东解放区之秦皇岛、北戴河、留守营、海阳镇、深海镇等地，并侵驻北平、天津、唐山、开平、秦皇岛、静海等地区，守护北宁路天津静海段，以便为国民党军守护战略据点输送兵员物资等。
    十月四日，美国军舰侵入中国人民解放区的烟台海港，并派军官上岸，公然胁迫解放军将烟台交美军“接收”。次日，解放军代表向侵华美军总司令魏德迈致严重抗议，美舰始被迫离去。十日，侵华美军在青岛登陆。同期，美海军航空队三个大队进驻青岛、北平。十日，中国共产党代表周恩来、王若飞与国民党政府代表王世杰、张群、张治中、邵力子，在经过四十天的谈判后，签订会谈纪要，宣布双方协议必须“坚决避免内战，建设独立、自由和富强的新中国”。协议要点如下：确定和平建国的基本方针；确认国民党应迅速结束训政，实现政治民主化；保证人民享有各民主国家人民应享之民主自由；党派平等合法；取消特务机关；释放政治犯；实行地方自治，进行自下而上的普选等项。未获协议的主要问题是人民解放军问题和人民解放区问题。国民党反动政府坚持不承认人民解放军和人民解放区，这表明国民党反动政府及其谈判代表在谈判中始终没有放松其反革命内战计划。关于人民解放军问题，中共方面提出公平合理地整编全国军队，中共领导下的抗日军队可以大量复员，并可将广东、浙江、苏南、皖南、皖中、湖南、湖北、河南（豫北不在内）八个地区的解放军迅速着手复员，并即从上述地区撤往苏北、皖北等地。全部解放军可以缩编为二十四个师或至少二十个师。但国民党反动政府表示其所领导下的军队已在整编，对中共领导的抗日军队的整编问题，未作任何肯定答复，只称“可以考虑”。关于解放区的人民政府问题，中共方面先后提出四种解决方案，均遭国民党反动政府无理拒绝。此外，关于国民大会，中共主张取消抗日战争前国民党反动派包办产生的伪国大代表，修改国民党反动派制定的反动的国民大会组织法，选举法和宪法草案，国民党方面也表示不能接受。国民党反动政府既然没有放松其内战独裁的计划，所以已经在谈判中获得的协议，首先是关于“坚决避免内战”的协议，随即被国民党反动政府破坏无余。签字的国民党政府代表或则积极参加这一破坏工作，或则坐视此种破坏不作一声。事实上在此协定签字之前二日，蒋介石还在用飞机向阎锡山运送“剿匪手册”，此项文件因飞机失事被获。在十一日中共毛泽东主席返延安，十二日会谈纪要公布后，十三日蒋介石即对其部下颁发“剿匪”密令，该令也被人民解放军缴获。该令称：“查抗战胜利，日寇投降，亟应从速建设，以完成抗战大业，乃奸匪竟乘机侵入城市，破坏交通，企图破坏统一，以遂其割据之阴谋，若不速予剿除，不仅八年抗战前功尽失，且必遗害无穷，使中华民族永无复兴之望，我辈将士何以对死难之同胞，更何以对阵亡之将士？贵长官所部自抗战以还，迭著勋功，党国依为长城，中正尤寄厚望。此次剿匪为人民幸福之所系，务本以往抗战之精神，遵照中正所订剿匪手本，督励所属，努力进剿，迅速完成任务，其功于国家者必得膺赏，其迟滞贻误者当必执法以罪，希转饬所属剿共部队官兵一体遵悉为要。”本月中，进犯晋东南解放区的阎锡山部国民党军三万余人被人民解放军完全歼灭，十九军军长史泽波等以下高级将领多人被俘。阎部的进犯开始于九月下旬的重庆谈判期间，是日本投降以来国民党反动军队向人民解放军第一次大规模的进攻，使用兵力先后达十三个师。晋东南地区为人民解放军整个抗战时期野战军总司令部所在地，一九三九年后即无阎锡山及其他任何国民党军。阎锡山在日本投降后公开与日寇勾结，并留用日军参加反人民的内战，杀人如麻，为山西人民所极端痛恨。十七日，人民解放军总部公布，日本投降后，国民党军已侵占解放区城市三十一座。十八日，长江以南苏南、皖南、浙东、浙西四个解放区内的人民解放军开始撤往长江以北。三十一日，依照蒋介石的“剿匪”命令而沿平汉路向晋冀鲁豫解放区北犯的第八军、三十军、四十军等部七万余人，于侵陷汤阴、磁县等地后，被人民解放军在邯郸地区全部歼灭，国民党军第一战区副司令长官马法五及其他军师长多人被俘。
    十一月四日，人民解放军朱德总司令向驻华美军总司令魏德迈抗议美军武装干涉中国内政。七日，人民解放军总部发表，国民党政府已调动一百万正规军并指挥七十万日伪军进攻解放区。八日，美国驻华军队总司令魏德迈在上海威胁称，华北美军“可能向共产党军队前进”。十一日，美国军舰三十一艘载运国民党军在秦皇岛登陆。这是美国海军运送国民党军往内战前线的开始。十五日，美国政府宣布继续以租借物资援助国民党政府，这是美国政府制造与扩大中国反革命内战的又一步骤。后据美国务院公布，迄至一九四七年六月底止，此项援助共达七七七、六三八、二九二美元。同日，美机掩护国民党军侵陷山海关。十九日，重庆各界代表成立反对内战联合会，号召国民党区的人民以行动反对国民党内战政策，反对美国干涉中国内政。这个运动同时发生于国民党区其他各大城市。坚持内战的国民党反动政府压迫人民这种正义运动，并指示其党徒提出“反反内战”、“反内乱”、“戡乱”等反动口号，明白地表示了自己的内战决心。
    十二月一日，国民党反动政府在昆明屠杀反对内战、反对美国干涉中国内政的学生和教员，死四人，伤数十人。昆明学生的反内战爱国运动开始于上月二十五日，坚持一月之久。惨案发生后，各地相继发生大规模的声援示威与罢课，均以反对内战、反对美国干涉中国内政为目标。四日，侵华美军炮轰解放区卢龙县某村。十五日，杜鲁门发表对华政策声明。声明中虽然声称赞成中国的团结与民主，并保证美国将不以军事干涉影响中国任何内争的过程，但以后的事实证明，这只是一种欺骗。声明用各种虚伪的借口来辩护美国海陆军驻扎中国，甚至说其目的是为了保障“中国成为一个统一、民主与和平的国家”，但是这种诡辩，恰恰证明了美国对于中国内政的军事干涉。声明中又称：“自治性的军队例如共产党军队之存在，乃与中国政治团结不相符合。”这个反动的武断，透露了美国政府支持国民党反动政府进行反革命内战的计划。二十日，美国总统特使马歇尔以“调处”中国内战的名义来华。二十二日，美国侵华海军开始运送国民党军杜聿明部前往东北进攻人民解放军。二十七日，莫斯科苏美英三外长会议发表中国问题公报，声明“他们忠实于不干涉中国内政的政策。……莫洛托夫先生声称：苏军已解决了解除满洲日军的武装并从那里撤退日军的任务。但根据中国政府请求，苏军因而延期在二月一日前撤退。贝纳斯先生声称其美军根据中国政府的请求驻在华北，美军的主要责任是执行日本投降条件，即是解除日军武装与撤退日军的责任。他声称：这些任务一旦完结时，或在中国政府没有美军援助能够执行这些任务时，美军即撤离中国。”以后苏联忠实地执行了这个决议，美国政府却至今仍在干涉中国内政，并在中国驻有军队。同日，重庆中共代表团向国民党反动政府提出立即无条件停战的建议，但被国民党反动政府所拒绝。
    一九四六年
    一月十日，中共中央与国民党政府同时颁布停战令。这一方面是中国共产党和全国人民坚持为和平而奋斗的结果，另一方面是国民党反动政府在美国特使马歇尔指示下认识到为了保持其反动统治必须争取时间充分展开其军队的结果。国民党反动政府及其美国主人既然抱着这样的阴谋，所以国民党反动军队从未忠实地遵守停战令，在停战令后仍在许多地方特别是在东北向解放区继续进攻，并在美国协助下调动军队前往内战前线。蒋介石曾于停战令发表之前三日颁发“尽速抢占战略要点”密令。同日，为了执行停战令，由中国国民党政府，中国共产党和美国政府三方代表成立军事调处执行部于北平，由上述三方有同样表决权的代表组成，下设若干军事调处执行小组，分赴各冲突地点进行调处。事实上国民党代表和美国代表并不制止国民党军队的破坏停战令，所以国民党军队的进攻继续发生，而在半年后就扩大成为全国性的内战。同日，政治协商会议在重庆开幕，三十一日闭幕。这个会议由国民党、共产党、民主同盟（民主社会党当时也包含在内）、青年党和无党派人士参加，其中反动分子虽占多数，但在人民压力和国民党政府内战布置尚未充分完成的情况之下，不得不全体一致地通过许多反映当时人民愿望和在当时条件下有利于和平民主团结的决议。这些决议包括和平建国纲领，和根据民主原则整编全国军队，改组国民政府、修改宪法草案、召集国民大会等项。此外，蒋介石在政协会议开幕时，曾宣布关于保障人民自由，保障各党派合法地位，实行普选和释放政治犯的四项诺言。但是无论蒋介石本人，或是国民党的代表孙科、吴铁城、陈布雷、陈立夫、张厉生、王世杰、邵力子、张群，或是青年党的代表曾琦、陈启天、杨永浚、余家菊、常燕生，或是民社党的代表张君劢，或是亲国民党的无党派代表王云五、傅斯年、胡霖、钱永铭、缪嘉铭、莫德惠，都背叛了他们自己的诺言和他们所曾表示拥护的决议。随着国民党战争准备的进展，这些假意拥护政协决议的反动分子就逐步地、最后并全部地撕毁了政协决议。
    二月十日，国民党反动政府指挥其特务人员在重庆较场口捣毁庆祝政协成功大会，打伤郭沫若、李公朴等多人。在此前后，国民党区各大城市均有同样的集会及游行，也多遭受国民党特务的破坏。这些事件，明显地表示了国民党反动政府反对政协决议，坚持独裁内战的立场。二十一日，国民党反动政府指挥其特务人员骚扰并捣毁北平军事调处执行部。二十二日，国民党反动政府在重庆制造反苏反共游行，并捣毁重庆新华日报及民主报。在此以后，国民党反动政府在其他大城市连续地制造了同样的鼓吹内战的游行。
    三月一日至十七日，国民党开该党二中全会。蒋介石在会上公开号召破坏政协决议，说是应“就其荦荦大端，妥筹补救”。该会决议推翻政协关于宪草决议中的各项民主原则，并通过了多项反对中国共产党的决议。十八日，中共中央发言人揭露国民党破坏政协决议，号召全国人民为坚持实现政协一切决议进行严重的奋斗。十九日，美国政府派赴国民党反动政府的军事顾问团成立。同日，国民党反动政府指挥其特务人员在哈尔滨刺死前东北抗日联军领袖李兆麟。二十七日，东北停战协议成立。一月十日停战令发布时，国民党反动政府代表坚持东北不在停战令范围之内。政协会后，国民党政府在美国特使马歇尔和美国海军的帮助之下，大量运兵前往东北扩大东北内战。至此，经中共及全国人民之努力，国民党政府乃在字面上勉强同意东北停战。但至三十一日，国民党即破坏该协议，在东北续向营口、本溪、四平街等地大举进攻。二十八日，国民党反动政府指挥其特务机关在江苏南通将四个民主青年暗杀后投入长江，并继续屠杀及逮捕数十人。
    四月一日，蒋介石在反动派包办的国民参政会发表演说，公开推翻东北停战协议，宣称“军事冲突的调处只在不影响行使国家行政权力的前提之下进行”；同时公开推翻政协决议，说“政治协商会议在本质上不是制宪会议，……如政治协商会议果真成为这样一个性质的会议，我们政府是决不能承认的”。六日，延安解放日报发表“驳蒋介石”的社论予以痛斥。三日，国民党政府逮捕北平中国共产党主办的解放报人员三十九人。八日，中共代表王若飞、秦邦宪因国民党推翻政协决议飞延安，叶挺、邓发等同行，途中因飞机失事遇难。九日，蒋介石秘密接见美国记者，表示他已决心消灭共产党，“现在只看美国的态度如何”。十六日，进攻四平街外围的国民党军八十七师被歼。十八日，东北人民解放军自伪军手中解放长春。次日，国民党政学系的大公报发表“可耻的长春之战”社评，反对人民解放军解放长春，并反对人民解放军的整个自卫战争。
    五月一日，民主同盟西北负责人李敷仁被国民党特务在咸阳暗杀，遇救未死。三日，东北苏军撤退完毕。按苏军的撤退曾因国民党政府的再三请求而再三延期。七日，新华社公布自一月十日停战命令起至本月初止，国民党正规军为继续内战而进行的师以上的调动，已查明者即达三十五个军九十九个师，兵力达一百万人以上。这种违背停战令的非法调动，充分表明了国民党军队正在紧张地布置着新的全国性的大内战。二十日、二十二日、二十八日，美国装备和美国运输的优势的国民党军先后侵占四平街、长春、永吉。国民党军在四平街作战中曾遭受人民解放军的严重打击。按：在东北停战协议成立后，美国海军替国民党政府运兵往东北更加积极，计三月底运去三个军，四月底五月初又运去两个军，连前一月份开始运送者，已达七个军以上。中共曾向马歇尔抗议这种运兵违背马歇尔本人的诺言，指出美国政府对于此事的后果应当负责。二十九日，国民党政府封闭中共主办的北平解放报，并同时封闭北平其他报刊通讯社共七十七家。三十一日，东北国民党军一八四师在师长潘朔端率领下在海城起义。此后，由于人民解放军的继续坚强抗击和国民党军兵力的分散和削弱，由于大部分国民党军被牵制于关内不能继续增援，国民党军在东北的进攻变为局部性。
    六月十四日，美国务卿贝纳斯向美国参议院提出“军事援华法案”。中旬，国民党反动政府代表向中共提出五项荒谬条件，企图胁迫中共屈服。条件为要求人民解放军退出下列各地：（一）陇海路以南的一切地区；（二）胶济线全线；（三）承德与承德以南的一切地区，以迄冀东沿海；（四）东北除龙江、兴安两省，嫩江省中部北部及延吉地区以外之所有各省；（五）六月七日后中共在山东山西两地从伪军手中解放的一切地区。并声明中共如不退出上述地区，则国民党政府不能考虑停战问题。国民党反动政府的反动要求，使六月间在南京举行的停战谈判毫无结果。这些反动要求国民党反动政府在以后数月一直坚持，并于八月上旬经马歇尔及美国驻华大使司徒雷登之手再次转交中共代表。谈判中，国民党政府并曾于书面文件中正式提议将国共谈判的“最后决定权”交予马歇尔之手，马歇尔本人也加以默认。二十日，南京中共代表周恩来声明反对国民党提出将中国问题“最后决定权”交给马歇尔的提议。二十一日，中共政协代表团向国民党政府提出长期停战、恢复交通、整军复员、重开政协等四项建议，并在此基础上继续谈判，希望最后阻止国民党政府已经部署就绪的全面内战的爆发，但遭国民党拒绝。二十二日，中共中央毛泽东主席发表反对美国“军事援华法案”声明，宣布“坚决反对美国政府继续以出售，交换、租借、赠送或让渡等方式将军火交给中国的国民党独裁政府，坚决反对美国派遣军事使团来华，并坚决要求美国立即停止与收回对华的一切所谓军事援助，和立即撤回在华的美国军队”。二十三日，上海十万群众举行反对内战、反对美国干涉中国内政示威，选出马叙伦等十人为代表赴南京请愿。马等于当日晚抵南京时遭国民党特务凶殴。二十六日，国民党军大举围攻在鄂东豫南地区的中原解放军，这是国民党发动全面内战的信号。中原解放军突围。二十七日，美国务院批准替国民党政府建立八又三分之一队空军进行内战。按：自一九四五年九月至本月止，美国海空军运送国民党军到达内战前线者，已达十四个军，四十一个师，八个交通警察总队，约五十四万余人。这样就决定地帮助完成了国民党反动政府发动全面内战的主要准备步骤。
    七月七日，中共中央发表纪念“七七”九周年宣言。宣言在分析国民党反动政府和美国帝国主义政府对于中国人民的进攻以后呼吁：（一）无例外、无条件、无限期的停止冲突、停止运兵、停止建筑工事、停止征兵。（二）重开政治协商会议，实行上届政治协商会议的一切决议。（三）实行复员裁兵，裁减军费。（四）要求美国停止干涉中国内政，停止助长中国内战，撤退一切在华海陆空军。宣言说：“如果贪得无厌的反动派一定要挑战，那么，就让我们准备着把一切敢于挑战的反动派打回去！”十一日、十五日，国民党反动政府指示其特务机关先后暗杀昆明民主同盟领袖李公朴、闻一多。十二日，国民党五十万军队在来安至南通八百里战线上向苏皖解放区大举进攻。国民党军队对解放区的进攻，至此遂全面发动。国民党政府用于这个全面内战中的兵力达二百个师，约二百万人，占国民党军作战兵力的百分之八十五。这时国民党军总数达四百三十万人，而人民解放军总数仅一百二十万人，其装备亦远不如国民党军。由于迷信自己的数量上和装备上的优势，蒋介石和他的参谋总长陈诚都吹嘘“两个月内消灭苏北中共军，五个月内在军事上解决整个中共”。又，本月底，国民党反动政府国防部长白崇禧在新乡召集的军事会议上宣称：“美国友人马歇尔将军，曾责备我们关外没有打好，国民党军队太没用，所以这次大家必得争口气，否则马歇尔将军又将责备我们无用。”十五日，人民解放军在苏中泰兴地区歼灭进犯的国民党军一个整编旅。自本月十五日至八月二十七日，解放军在苏中地区七战七捷，共歼灭进犯的国民党军十三个旅，内有七个整旅，俘五万余人。人民解放军在作战中以歼灭敌人有生力量为主要目标，不以保守或夺取城市及地方为主要目标，所以虽然在国民党军的进攻面前退出了许多城市和一部分乡村，但是最后终于击破敌人的攻势而使自己转入进攻。十六日，美国会通过以二七一艘舰艇“赠送”国民党卖国政府进行反革命内战。二十二日，陈立夫在上海发表谈话，认为解决中共问题如治盲肠炎，应当施用外科手术。二十九日，美军侵入冀东解放区之安平镇，枪击人民解放军。
    八月十日，马歇尔及美驻华大使司徒雷登发表联合声明。在美国政府已经帮助国民党反动政府发动了对解放区的全面进攻后，马、司二人为国民党反动政府辩护说：“国共双方均愿终止战争，但仍有立须解决之问题尚未获得任何协议。对于上述各问题似已不可能获得解决。”十日至二十一日，人民解放军在陇海路豫东段歼灭进犯的国民党军一万六千余人。十六日，延安解放日报发表社论，号召全解放区人民紧急动员起来，粉碎蒋介石的进攻。二十七日，国民党军侵陷承德。二十八日，人民解放军在同蒲路中段歼灭进犯的国民党军阎锡山部九千。三十日，国民党卖国政府与美空军军官陈纳德成立协定，设立陈纳德空中运输公司，担负国民党政府对东北、华北、华中各战场空运人员与军用物资的任务。三十一日，美国政府不顾中共的反对，以廉价让售原值八万万余美元之西太平洋战争剩余物资与国民党政府。
    九月三日至九日，人民解放军在鲁西南定陶、菏泽地区歼灭进犯的国民党军四个整旅，活捉敌整编师长赵锡田。十四日，人民解放军于歼灭进犯的国民党军一个多师后撤出集宁。此后国民党军即继续向张家口方向进犯。十七日，国民党军侵占淮阴。二十三日，蒋介石在南昌发表演说，宣扬十多年前江西“剿匪”的“光荣传统”。同日，中国各城市人民要求美军退出中国运动周开始。二十四日，人民解放军在晋南浮山歼灭进犯的国民党军第一师，活捉敌师长黄正成。三十日，周恩来致马歇尔并转国民党政府代表备忘录一件，内称：“如果国民党不立即停止对张家口及其周围的一切军事行动，中共代表不能不认为政府业已公然宣告全面破裂，并已最后放弃政治解决方针；其因此造成的一切严重后果，当然全部责任均由政府方面负之。”但国民党政府仍拒绝停止对于张家口的进攻。
    十月十一日，国民党军侵占张家口。占领张家口代表国民党军全面进攻的最高潮。因此，同日下午，被“胜利”冲昏头脑的蒋介石即违背政协决议下令召开分裂的独裁的伪国民大会。但是事实上由于有生力量的不断被歼灭，国民党军的攻势此后即逐渐下降，并在不久以后由全面进攻转入重点进攻。十七日，中共中央发表时局声明，历述中国共产党为了实现国内和平，曾在（一）一九四五年十月十日的会谈纪要，（二）一九四六年一月十日的停战协定，（三）同月三十一日的政协五项决议，（四）二月二十五日的整军方案，（五）三月二十七日的东北停战协议，（六）六月的和平谈判，（七）六月谈判失败后的关于在停战条件下参加改组政府商谈的表示，（八）十月初的关于只要国民党军停止进攻张家口即可开始军事政治商谈的表示中，作了八次重大的让步，但均为国民党与美国方面所破坏与拒绝。由此可见，蒋美两方所追求的只是中国民主运动的消灭。声明指出：鉴于第三方面的斡旋，中共仍愿作最后最大的让步，即在恢复本年一月十三日停战令生效时的军事位置及实现一月三十一日政协一切决议的先决条件下进行和平谈判。国民党反动政府对于中共上述提议仍然拒绝。在中共时局声明发表后，国民党首要彭学沛、吴铁城等相继发表谈话，声言全国版图均应在国民党反动政府管辖之下，恢复一月十三日停战令位置为“不可能”。十八日，蒋介石在南京召开秘密军事会议，又一次宣布“五个月之内打垮中共军”。白崇禧在该会上发表演说，认为必须实行蒋介石在江西“剿共”的战术，“三分军事，七分政治。”同一期间，陈诚在北平召开另一军事会议，亦重复宣称“三个月至多五个月可以完成以军事解决问题”。十九日至二十六日，人民解放军在苏北涟水保卫战中歼敌一个整旅。二十五日，国民党军侵占安东。三十日至三十一日，人民解放军在鲁西南鄄城附近歼灭进犯的国民党军一个半旅，活捉敌旅长刘广信。
    十一月一日至二日，人民解放军在南满宽甸、桓仁地区歼灭继续向南满进犯的国民党军一个整师，活捉敌师长李正谊。四日，国民党卖国政府与美国帝国主义政府签订空前地侵害中国经济主权的“中美友好通商航海条约”。该项卖国条约的签订系由伪行政院长宋子文、伪驻美大使顾维钧等直接主持，并由伪外交部长王世杰代表国民党政府签字。十二日，顾维钧在纽约美国全国对外贸易会议上声明称：按照“中美商约”，“全中国领土均向美国商人开放”。十五日，蒋介石召开反动的、违反政治协商会议决议的伪国民大会以通过反动独裁的伪宪法。曾经参加通过政协决议的国民党代表张群、邵力子等人，以及中国青年党代表、民主社会党代表和所谓社会贤达王云五、傅斯年、莫德惠、胡霖等人，都参加了这个伪国大。伪国大的主席团包括李宗仁、白崇禧、王云五、莫德惠、胡适、于斌等。但一切民主的党派和民主的无党派人士都拒绝参加伪国大。因此，连美国帝国主义的报纸纽约先锋论坛报都不能不承认：“听蒋主席演说的都是反动分子。”伪国大在通过反动独裁的伪宪法之后，于十二月二十五日闭幕。十二月二十八日，中国共产党声明：已闭幕的蒋记国大及其制订的蒋记宪法均属非法与无效。中国民主同盟、三民主义同志联合会等民主党派，和上海工人协会等人民团体均先后声明不承认伪宪法。十九日至二十一日，人民解放军在豫北濮阳、滑县地区，歼灭进犯的国民党军两个整旅，活捉敌旅长杨显明。二十二日，莫洛托夫在联合国政治委员会上谴责美国违背一九四五年十二月莫斯科外长会议决议而继续驻军中国。三十日，国民党卖国政府与美国帝国主义政府签订侵害中国领空主权的“中美空中运输协定”。同日，国民党反动政府在上海命令军警屠杀摊贩，摊贩死七人，受伤和被捕多人。五千摊贩为此于十二月二日竟日包围上海国民党警察局，又被国民党军警加以屠杀，死十人，伤百余人。
    十二月三日，美国总统杜鲁门以“自由勋章”颁给进攻东北人民的国民党军将领杜聿明、郑洞国、赵家骧、廖耀湘、赵公武等。在此以前，白崇禧和陈诚也曾受到杜鲁门的同样勋章。十五日至十九日，人民解放军在苏北宿迁、沭阳地区歼灭进犯的国民党军整编第六十九师三个旅，击毙敌师长戴之奇。二十四日，北平发生美军强奸北大女生暴行案，引起全国学生抗议美军暴行、要求美军退出中国的爱国运动。从本月底到一九四七年一月，北平、天津、上海、南京、开封、重庆、昆明、武汉、广州、杭州、苏州、台北等地数十万学生相继举行抗议罢课和游行示威。自日本投降以来，驻华美军杀害、殴辱中国同胞，强奸中国妇女的暴行，层出不穷。据重庆民主报发表，截至本年七月止，中国人民死在美军吉普底下者达一千多人，中国妇女被强奸者达三百人，上海一地被美军无理殴打受伤的即达三百多人。又据上海时代日报发表，自本年八月至年底，上海一地美军吉普撞死撞伤人的事件，即达八百起之多。无理占驻中国领土的美军的这种血腥罪行，激起了中国人民的巨大爱国义愤。但国民党政府则庇护美军。北大女生被强奸事件发生后，国民党卖国政府以“有污友邦”为名，禁止各报刊登此项消息，并到处出动军警镇压学生的爱国游行。二十六日，陈诚在伪国大代表招待会上宣称将于“一年内消灭中共”。二十七日国民党反动政府在由美国帝国主义支配的联合国救济总署庇护下，违反本年夏间中共、国民党与联总三方关于黄河应先复堤后归故的协议，悍然放水引导黄河归入故道，企图水淹解放区。三十日，蒋介石发出侍天字第七十号密令，指示其部下称：“三十六年度上半年各部队作战目标应是打通陇海、津浦、同蒲、平汉与中东铁路诸线，肃清冀鲁晋陕等地境内股匪”，“在今后一年内彻底消灭万恶之奸匪”。
    一九四七年
    一月一日，中共毛泽东主席发表新年献词，预言本年“中国人民争取民主自由的运动，将要得到比一九四六年更重要的胜利”，“独立和平民主的新中国，一定要在今后数年内奠定稳固的基础。”一日至三十一日，人民解放军在鲁西南巨野、鱼台等地歼灭进犯的国民党军三万余，活捉敌旅长谢懋权。二日至二十日，人民解放军在鲁南歼灭进犯的国民党军四个整旅另一个快速纵队，共四万九千余人，活捉敌整编师长马励武、周毓英。鲁南和鲁西南的胜利，严重地打击了国民党反动政府以山东为重点的进攻，但国民党反动政府仍继续调集重兵于山东方面，并继续进攻。七日，马歇尔在以“调处”为掩护，帮助国民党反动政府取得了准备内战的时间，为国民党反动政府装备与运输了大量内战军队，给以大量战争物资的援助，使其发动了空前大规模的反革命内战之后，在他的欺骗诡计已被中国人民所彻底揭穿之后，离华返美。十六日，蒋介石经司徒雷登通知中共要派张治中来延商谈和平。十七日，中共中央负责人发表谈话予以拒绝，指出“这完全是欺骗作用。……张治中氏本人曾于去年三月二十七日代表蒋介石签订了东北停战协定，但是仅仅五天，就被蒋介石撕毁，在东北大打起来。……除非蒋介石取消伪宪，及恢复去年一月十三日军事位置，便无法证明他不是欺骗。”二十九日，美国政府宣布退出中国三人委员会及军事调处执行部。二十日至二十八日，人民解放军在晋西孝义地区歼敌万余。二十一日至二十八日，人民解放军在望都和定县歼敌万余。
    二月一日，中共中央声明：国民党政府在内战期间与外国成立的借款、协定与外交谈判一概无效。二日，人民解放军在豫东太康等地区歼敌万余。四日，延安解放日报发表，美国帝国主义政府经过国民党卖国政府，在台湾取得海空军基地。五日及八日，国民党卖国政府指挥军警特务在重庆两度凶殴进行抗议美军暴行宣传的爱国学生，打伤四十多人。九日，国民党卖国政府又在上海指挥特务袭击爱用国货集会，打死永安公司职员梁仁达，打伤十余人。十日，由于国民党反动政府经济危机进一步恶化，蒋介石颁布“紧急经济措施方案”，以“经济警察”管制市场，掠夺中小工商业者，冻结职工生活指数，并禁止工人罢工及私人资本家关厂。十五日，国民党军侵占山东临沂。二十日至二十三日，人民解放军在山东莱芜歼灭继续进犯的国民党军七十三军、四十六军及十二军一个师共七个整师，五万余人，活捉敌第二绥区副司令官李仙洲和七十三军军长韩浚。二十一日，中共驻北平军事调处执行部人员叶剑英等被迫全部返回延安。二十七日及二十八日，国民党反动政府通知中共驻南京、上海、重庆三地人员限定三月五日前撤返延安，随即以特务包围监视中共驻三地人员，并宣称“以后如发现中共党员，即作为匪徒间谍治罪”。该三地中共人员于三月七日全部返延。国民党采取逐退中共人员的最后分裂行动，说明它已最后自绝于人民。二十八日，由于国民党反动政府指挥军警屠杀台北市民，全台人民发动武装起义。迄三月八日止，起义者曾控制台湾大部分城市。国民党反动政府对起义者实行血腥屠杀。自三月八日至十六日，台胞被屠杀者在一万人以上，全台五家民间报纸都被封，各报负责人都被逮捕。
    三月十日，人民解放军在松花江畔全歼自长春出犯的国民党军一个整师。自一月至三月，人民解放军三下松花江南，并在南满临江地区四次击退进犯的国民党军，共歼敌六万九千余人。十四日，国民党十六个旅在胡宗南指挥下大举进犯陕甘宁解放区，于十九日侵占中共中央所在地延安，并继续向陕北各地进攻，所至奸淫掳掠，破坏极烈。按国民党军这时的进攻只有两个重点，即山东和陕北。十五日，国民党召开该党三中全会。蒋介石和陈诚在会上都宣称作战到底。陈诚在二十日招待记者称：“余曾有言，如果真正作战，只需三个月即可击破共军主力，但过去因是和谈关系，国军多是被动挨打。政府用兵之目的在于平定叛乱，非至共军全部解除武装不止。”二十三日，内蒙人民代表大会开幕，于五月五日闭幕，选出内蒙人民自治政府。二十五日，人民解放军在延安东北歼敌一个旅，活捉敌旅长李纪云。
    四月三日，人民解放军在南满柳河地区歼敌一个整师。本月四日至五月六日，人民解放军在晋南举行进攻，歼敌一万七千，克城十九座，除临汾、运城等少数孤点外，晋南全部解放。九日，人民解放军在石家庄外围歼敌万余。自九日至五月四日，人民解放军连克正定、滦城、井陉、娘子关、盂县、平定、阳泉、寿阳等城镇，共歼敌三万五千，内日军四百。十四日，人民解放军在陕北瓦窑堡附近歼敌一个旅，活捉代旅长麦宗禹。十六日至十八日，人民解放军在豫北淇县以北歼敌一个快速纵队和一个整旅，活捉敌第二快速纵队司令李守正。十八日蒋介石“改组政府”，国民党政学系首领张群代宋子文为伪行政院长，反动政客王云五为副院长，其他参加这个政府做伪国府委员、伪政务委员、伪部长的政协代表，有曾琦、左舜生、陈启天、余家菊、莫德惠、缪嘉铭、邵力子等。二十四日至二十六日，人民解放军在鲁中泰安歼敌整编第七十二师三个整旅。
    五月一日，人民解放军在豫北攻克汤阴，歼敌九千余人，活捉敌纵队司令孙殿英。同日，白崇禧在伪立法院呼吁支持政府消灭中共。白反对再谈和平，以免影响士气。并称美国对国民党政府的同情是“不必担心的问题”。四日，白又在国民党政府全国粮食会议上呼吁加紧征粮以为“戡乱”军事之用，并称将于本年内击溃中共。二日至九日，在物价飞速上涨，人民食粮缺乏的情况下，杭州、无锡、芜湖、宣城、合肥、吴兴、衢县、成都、上海、南京等城市相继发生抢米风潮。四日，上海各校学生举行游行示威，反对物价高涨与官僚资本投机操纵。学生反饥饿反内战运动，迅即扩及南京、杭州、北平、沈阳、青岛、开封等地。与此同时，国民党区工人罢工示威的浪潮亦趋高涨。初旬上海八千工人与学生包围国民党警察局，另有一万五千人举行反饥饿示威。南通二万多工人举行反饥饿罢工。同日，人民解放军在延安东北蟠龙镇歼敌一个整旅，活捉敌旅长李＠岗。十一日，人民解放军在东北的夏季攻势开始，二十天内歼敌五万，克城二十二座，东北战场转入进攻。十四日至十六日，人民解放军在鲁中蒙阴孟良崮全歼敌整编第七十四师三个旅三万二千余人，毙敌师长张灵甫。十八日，国民党反动政府颁布法西斯恐怖的“维持社会秩序暂时办法”。国民党反动政府二十日召开伪国民参政会，会上国民党参政员纷纷反对和谈，要求下讨伐令。孔庚说“主和者为现代秦桧”，燕树棠说他“不愿和谈，更讨厌和谈”，这类言论都受到会场大多数的鼓掌。该会决议“请政府速派大军清剿各地共匪”，并“速向美国政府切实磋商借款”。二十日，京沪苏杭区学生六千余人不顾国民党反动政府的压迫，在南京举行“挽救教育危机联合大游行”，并向于同日开幕的伪国民参政会请愿，参政员溜走，学生被军警重伤二十一人，轻伤九十七人，逮捕二十余人。天津学生在同日示威中亦受伤五十余人。此次反内战、反饥饿、反暴行的学生运动遍及于京、沪、杭、平、津、沈、青岛、开封、西安、武汉、长沙、重庆、成都、贵阳、昆明、广州、福州、南昌等地。三十日，中共权威人士评时局，指出国民党政府已处在全民的包围中，并且找不出逃脱的方法，中国人民应为革命的胜利准备一切必要的条件。

    七月一日，人民解放军在东北夏季攻势结束，共歼敌八万二千人，克城四十三座。一日至八日，人民解放军在山东的费县和泰安歼敌两个旅。自六月三十日起，人民解放军在晋冀鲁豫前线渡过黄河，进至鲁西南，转入进攻，于本月八日在郓城歼敌整编第五十五师两个旅，活捉敌副师长理明亚；十日在定陶歼敌一个旅；十二日至十四日在巨野金乡间歼敌整编第三十二师及整编第七十师三个旅，活捉敌师长陈颐鼎；二十二日在金乡以北歼敌一个旅另一个团，活捉敌旅长王仕翘；廿八日在金乡以北的羊山集歼敌整编第六十六师两个旅，活捉敌师长宋瑞珂。二十天内共歼敌九个半旅，六万余人。这是人民解放军在全国范围内转入进攻的开始。四日，国民党反动政府举行“国务会议”，出席的“国府委员”有国民党的蒋介石、孙科、张群、居正、戴传贤、于右任、张继、邹鲁、宋子文、翁文灏、王宠惠、邵力子、王世杰、蒋梦麟、钮永建、吴忠信、陈布雷，青年党的余家菊，民社党的胡海门、＠翼翘，“社会贤达”的王云五、莫德惠、陈辉德等人，“一致通过”蒋介石所提的“厉行全国总动员，以戡平共匪叛乱，扫除民主障碍，如期实施宪政，贯彻和平建国方针案”。应对反革命内战负责的反动分子们，这次都向人民暴露了自己的真面目。青年党的余家菊说：“自应加强剿匪军事。”陈启天说：“余等对政府此一重大措施，完全表示赞同。”民社党的蒋匀田说：“对剿共戡乱一事，余等极表拥护。”张君劢说：希望“总动员案能获得所希望的效果”。各省市的伪参议会，国民党官办的所谓人民团体亦纷纷通电拥护戡乱伪令，并在各地召开所谓“戡乱建国动员大会”。七日，蒋介石的北平行辕主任李宗仁发表演说称：“所有一切人力物力，都要用在戡乱方面，这样才可以迅速的戡平内乱。目前是军事最重要的阶段，军事能够胜利，一切问题都可以有办法。”十一日，白崇禧向伪国民参政会常驻会发表反对和谈的演说称：共军的优势地位，一部分即由一九四六年的调处政策所造成，因该项政策阻止了政府在一年前去进攻尚属薄弱的共军，而使共军得以坐大。二十日，美国政府驻南京大使司徒雷登宣称：“以中国目前局势论，对日和约之讨论尚属次要，首要工作当为军事剿共也。”九日，国民党反动政府决定撤消政协名义及政协秘书处组织。二十五日，国民党反动政府通令取消共产党国大代表、国民政府委员会保留名额，对现任共产党参政员予以除名。

    一月一日，新华社发表题为“将革命进行到底”的社论，揭露国民党反动派和美国帝国主义所玩弄的假和平阴谋和企图在革命阵营中组织“反对派”的阴谋，号召全国人民和各民主党派更加巩固地团结一致，在中国共产党领导之下，彻底消灭反动势力，将革命进行到底。同日，蒋介石发表求和声明，提出要在保存伪法统、伪宪法和保存国民党反动军队等条件下，与中国共产党谈判“和平”，企图以假和平阴谋，争取喘息时间，重整力量，以便卷土重来，向革命力量反扑。新华社记者五日发表评论予以痛斥。一日，中共中央发布“关于建立中国新民主主义青年团的决议”，并公布“中国新民主主义青年团团章草案”。八日，国民党政府要求美英法苏调停中国内战，企图让外国干涉中国内政。十七日，苏联政府函复国民党政府拒绝参与调停中国内战。二十四日，国民党政府发言人承认美英法苏四国都已经拒绝调停中国内战。十日，人民解放军于永城东北地区全部歼灭邱清泉、李弥两兵团八个军二十一个师及孙元良兵团残部，活捉拒绝投降并施放毒气的战争罪犯国民党徐州“剿总”副总司令杜聿明，击毙敌兵团司令邱清泉。至此，伟大的淮海战役全部胜利结束，全役共歼敌六十万人，内包括五十七个整师。十二日，国民党飞机狂炸济南，炸死炸伤市民一百四十余人，次日又轰炸徐州，死伤市民三十余人。十四日，中共中央毛泽东主席发表关于时局的声明，提出：为了迅速结束战争，实现真正的和平，减少人民的痛苦，中国共产党愿意与南京国民党反动政府及其他任何国民党地方政府与军事集团在八个条件的基础之上进行和平谈判：（一）惩办战争罪犯；（二）废除伪宪法；（三）废除伪法统；（四）依据民主原则改编一切反动军队；（五）没收官僚资本；（六）改革土地制度；（七）废除卖国条约；（八）召开没有反动分子参加的政治协商会议，成立民主联合政府，接收南京国民党反动政府及其所属各级政府的一切权力。此项声明获得全国人民及各民主党派的热烈拥护。十五日，人民解放军解放天津，歼敌十三万余人，活捉天津国民党警备司令陈长捷及伪市长杜建时等人。人民解放军于十四日开始进攻天津前，曾劝告天津国民党军自动放下武器，免使天津遭受战争破坏，但陈长捷等却拒绝人民解放军劝告，并实行了罪恶的战犯行为，下令将天津市郊十多个村镇全部烧光，使数万人民陷于流离失所和饥饿境地。十七日，人民解放军解放塘沽。十九日，国民党反动政府行政院决议要求所谓“先行无条件停战”，而对中共八项条件置若罔闻，证明国民党政府完全没有和平诚意。中共中央发言人二十一日发表谈话予以痛斥。二十日和二十一日，人民解放军解放蚌埠和合肥。战争罪犯顾祝同命令国民党军队于蚌埠撤退前将蚌埠以北淮河大桥炸毁。二十一日，国民党政府伪总统蒋介石以“因故不能视事”的名义宣告“引退”，把职务交给伪副总统李宗仁“代理”。蒋贼由南京飞到奉化，退到幕后指挥。蒋贼“引退”前曾拟定一项利用“和谈”、争取三个月至六个月时间、在江南重新编练国民党军队的计划，以便卷土重来。二十二日，李宗仁发表文告，宣称“中共所提八条件，政府愿即开始商谈”。李宗仁在文告中说：“在八年抗战之后，继之以三年之内战，不仅将抗战胜利后国家可能复兴之一线生机毁灭无遗，而战祸遍及黄河南北，田园庐舍悉遭摧毁荒废，无辜人民之死伤成千累万，妻离子散啼饥号寒者到处皆是。此一惨绝人寰的浩劫，实为我国内战史上空前所未有。”李宗仁在这里实际上是承认了国民党反动政府应负战争的责任。但是李宗仁在行动上依然没有超出企图为美国侵略者和国民党反动派保存残余势力的范围。同日，到达解放区的各民主党派、各人民团体的代表人物及其他民主人士李济深、沈钧儒、马叙伦、郭沫若等五十五人发表对时局声明，表示坚决拥护中共十四日声明中所提出的八项和平条件，反对国民党反动派的假“和平”阴谋，表示愿在中共领导下，团结一致，将革命进行到底。接着，中国民主同盟、中国人民救国会、中国农工民主党、中国民主促进会、中国致公党、国民党革命委员会、三民主义同志会等又分别发表了同类性质的声明。二十五日，人民解放军解放扬州。二十六日，蒋介石自奉化亲函在南京、上海的国民党军事、政治、党务、特务首领，命令他们必须作战到底。同日，国民党反动卖国政府的审判战犯军事法庭宣判日本侵华战犯冈村宁次无罪。中共发言人为此于二十八日发表谈话，命令南京反动政府立即将冈村重新逮捕监禁，其他日本战犯一概不得擅自释放。但国民党卖国政府仍于三十一日将冈村宁次及其他日本战犯二百六十名送往日本。二十九日，伪国防部参谋总长顾祝同对国民党反动军队发出密令称：“吾人为求捍卫国家民族及党与军之生存，应下最大决心，与之（指中共）誓不两立，坚决从事长期自救、自卫与救民之战争。”白崇禧于二月四日将该通令转发其部下，为人民解放军缴获。三十一日，人民解放军解放北平，北平国民党军华北剿匪总司令傅作义率部二十五万人接受平津前线人民解放军的要求自二十二日起开出城外听候人民解放军改编。北平的解放，是伟大的中国人民革命运动中最重要的军事发展和政治发展之一，是遵照中共八项和平条件以和平方法结束战争的第一个榜样。傅作义在和平解决北平问题上的将功折罪的行动，使他获得了人民的谅解。本月份人民解放军共歼灭和整编敌军六十二万八千人，内包括六十一个整师，解放人口九百六十万，土地二万平方公里，城市三十九座。
    二月一日，人民解放军解放南通。四日，人民解放军解放湖北荆门，活捉敌七十九军军长方靖。二十日，人民解放军向陕中进军，至二十四日，连克铜川、耀县、蒲城、富平、淳化等五城。三日，人民解放军举行进驻北平入城式，受北平市民盛大热烈欢迎。四日，中共中央关于国民党卖国政府将日本侵华战犯冈村宁次放回日本事发表声明，警告国民党反动政府须将冈村及其他日本战犯立即追回交人民解放军重新审判，并声明中国人民保留将来重新审判被东京麦克阿瑟总部释放的一切日本侵华战犯之权。五日，中共发言人声明：八项和平条件的第一条应包括惩办日本战争罪犯和国内战争罪犯的两个项目。五日，国民党反动政府行政院迁往广州。七日，伪行政院长孙科在广州宣布“吾人应对过去重新加以检讨”，“共党所提出之惩办战犯一节，系绝对不能接受者”，反对中共所提之八项和平条件。九日，国民党反动政府国防部政工局长邓文仪发表谈话，宣称“不惜牺牲一切，与共党周旋到底”。十三日，国民党中央宣传部发出“特别宣传指示”，令各地宣传“政府与其无条件投降，不如作战到底”，“毛泽东一月十四日声明所提八点为亡国条件，政府原不应接受”。十二日，国民党云南省主席卢汉及宪警，在昆明中央银行门前枪杀因挤换被该行宣布为伪票之金圆券的市民二十一人。十七日，国民党京沪杭区警备总司令汤恩伯及淞沪警备司令陈大庆下令枪决上海交通汽车公司罢工之三名职工。十三日，中共发言人痛斥澳洲外长伊瓦特建议联合国调停中国内战的荒谬建议。十四日，颜惠庆、邵力子、章士钊、江庸、黄启汉等以私人资格飞抵北平，与中共方面商谈国事，并于二十二日飞石家庄，为中共毛泽东主席及周恩来将军所接见，对和平谈判及南北通航通邮等项问题广泛交换了意见。十五日，原晋绥解放区与陕甘宁解放区合并。二十三日，国民党反动政府在广州的行政院，通过“财政金融改革案”，规定以银元和所谓“关元”为军费开支和关税征收的计算单位，部分货物税和盐税改征实物，允许各地方政府自由征税等。其实质即是宣告金圆券的完全破产，另采取直接掠夺人民现金及实物及允许各地无限制的征收苛捐杂税。二十五日，李济深、沈钧儒、马叙伦、郭沫若等民主人士三十五人经中共中央代表林伯渠迎接自东北抵平。次日，中共北平方面负责人举行欢迎各方民主人士的盛大欢迎会。二十七日，北平市军事管制委员会通令，因现值军事时期，所有在平外国通讯社及外国记者，均应停止在平活动。
    三月一日，中华全国学生全国代表大会在北平开幕，六日闭幕，建立了统一的中华全国学联，并通过了目前中国学生运动的任务决议案。一日至三日，在北平和天津举行的华北解放区与国民党统治区的通航商谈获得协议。一日，麦克阿瑟发表“在对日和约签订前台湾属于盟军总部”的荒谬声明，并指使台湾借美国间谍廖文毅等假借台人团体名义重新发出要求台湾“独立”的叫喊，妄图侵占中国的领土台湾省。三日至六日，中原解放区举行临时人民代表大会选出中原临时人民政府。五日，中国民主同盟在北平成立临时工作委员会，其原在香港的总部同时结束。八日，国民党反动政府孙科内阁总辞职。伪代总统李宗仁在乞得蒋介石同意之后于十二日任命何应钦为伪行政院长。九日，国民党伪国防部兵役局宣布，本年度将征集二百万人入伍，国民党伪政府正在各地召开征兵会议，赶速抓丁，以继续进行反革命内战。十四日至二十八日，由于国民党反动统治所造成的严重饥饿状态，国民党统治区各地学生、教职员和校工举行了反饥饿斗争。十八日，新华社发表社论，响应召开世界拥护和平大会，并指出：如果帝国主义国家的冒险分子居然胆敢挑动新的世界大战，中国人民将执行孙中山先生致苏联遗书中的指示：中国与苏联“携手并进以取得胜利”。十九日，美国帝国主义者与国民党反动卖国政府出动漆有美国国徽的Ｂ９式重轰炸机多架炸毁于上月二十五日起义并于本月四日开到东北葫芦岛的巡洋舰重庆号。同日美国海军并出动三艘潜水艇到葫芦岛海面，以阻止重庆号转移他处。美国帝国主义者的这个行动，又一次地直接侵犯了中国的领空领海主权，并直接参加了国民党反动政府所进行的反革命内战。二十五日，京沪杭警备总司令部禁止香港等地一百八十五种报纸杂志销售。二十四日，中国妇女第一次全国代表大会开幕。上月二十日至本月二十四日，人民解放军在陕中春季战役中歼敌七千人。本月中，中国共产党在石家庄附近举行七届二次中央委员会全体会议，批准了自一九四五年六月一中全会以来中央政治局的工作，批准了召开没有反动分子参加的新的政治协商会议，以便成立民主联合政府，并批准了毛泽东主席一月十四日关于与国民党反动政府进行和平谈判问题的声明。全会指出：党的工作重心由乡村移到城市，全党党员必须用全力学习工业生产技术和管理生产的方法，学习与生产有密切联系的商业工作、银行工作和其他工作。全会指出：党必需认真地团结全体工人阶级，全体农民阶级和广大的革命知识分子，以为无产阶级领导的以工农联盟为主体的人民民主专政的领导力量与基础力量，同时，也必需团结尽可能多的能够与共产党合作的小资产阶级和自由资产阶级的代表人物，他们的知识分子与政治派别，以便共同打倒国内的反革命势力与帝国主义势力，迅速地恢复和发展生产，从而创造条件使中国有可能稳步地由农业国转变为工业国，由新民主主义国家转变为社会主义国家。二十五日，中共中央委员会与中国人民解放军总部迁至北平。中国人民革命军事委员会主席毛泽东和中国人民解放军总司令朱德在西苑机场举行盛大的阅兵式。二十六日，中国各人民团体所选出的出席巴黎世界拥护和平大会的中国代表团在北平成立，以郭沫若为团长，刘宁一、马寅初为副团长，钱俊瑞为秘书长。代表团于二十九日启程赴巴黎。二十六日，中共中央决定派周恩来、林伯渠、林彪、叶剑英、李维汉为和谈代表（四月一日加派聂荣臻为代表），周恩来为首席代表，以毛泽东主席一月十四日声明的八项和平条件为基础，自四月一日起在北平与国民党反动政府的代表团进行和平谈判，并由广播电台通知国民党反动政府，依照上述时间地点，派遣其代表团，携带为八项条件所需的必要材料，以利举行谈判。国民党反动政府派定邵力子、张治中、黄绍＠、章士钊、李蒸、刘斐为谈判代表，以张治中为首席代表，于四月一日来平。关于这个代表团，值得注意的是：第一、张治中于二十九日特奉李宗仁、何应钦之命飞往奉化见第一号战争罪犯人民公敌蒋介石，“请求指示”。第二、张治中代表团于四月一日来平，送行的南京六千爱国学生竟遭南京军警特务凶殴，死伤失踪两百余人。这两件事表明，迄今为止，国民党反动卖国政府只是想利用和谈抬高身价，保存反动势力，并没有悔祸自新，将功折罪，接受中共八项和平条件实现真正和平的任何诚意。毛泽东主席在一月十四日的声明中曾经估计到这种情况，因此在声明结束时说：“中国人民解放军全体指挥员战斗员注意：在南京国民党反动政府接受并实现真正的民主的和平以前，你们丝毫也不应当松懈你们的战斗努力。对于任何敢于反抗的反动派，必须坚决、彻底干净全部地歼灭之。”
