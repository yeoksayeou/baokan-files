Xinhua News Agency, Yangtze River Front, 22nd, 2400 hours: During the crossing-the-river operation in the Zhenjiang-Jiangyin section, the People's Liberation Army (PLA) overcame the joint attacks of British imperialism and the Kuomintang's large fleet on the 20th and 21st. This event deserves the great attention of the people of the whole country. The course of events is as follows: When our army attacked the enemy bridgehead on the north bank and many islands in the river on the 20th, preparing to cross the river in a large scale, in addition to fighting the Kuomintang army, it also had to fight the Kuomintang navy. On the morning of the 20th, two enemy ships sailed from east to west, firing at our bridgehead position on the north bank called Kou'an, northwest of Taixing County and directly north of Yangzhong County. The purpose was to prevent us from attacking Central Island and deploying ships to cross the river. Our artillery immediately fought back bravely, destroying one enemy ship, which soon sank. The other was wounded and sailed west, sinking mostly near Zhenjiang. At this time, another enemy ship sailed east from Zhenjiang and fired at our position near Kou'an. We returned fire again and damaged the ship. The ship then sailed downstream. On the morning of the 21st, two more ships came from the east, one large and one small. At this time, we fired first, preventing them from approaching, and wounded both ships, which fled in a panic towards Jiangyin. Because of the victory in this battle against enemy ships, the enemy's plan to prevent us from crossing the river was broken, and we were able to cross the river on a large scale on the afternoon of the 21st. When our army fought the above-mentioned five enemy ships, there were still several enemy ships anchored in the river not far from the above-mentioned five ships, which also participated in the battle, but were not very active because they feared our artillery fire. Until the night of the 21st, our army still thought that the above-mentioned ships were Kuomintang warships. It was not until the 22nd, after collecting information from various sources, that we learned that four of the above-mentioned ships were British warships. Of the four British warships, three fled east of Jiangyin after being defeated, probably to Shanghai. Another British warship is now aground in the river not far from Zhenjiang. Detailed information will only be available after our army occupies Zhenjiang. In the process of fighting the above-mentioned ships, the People's Liberation Army suffered 252 casualties, and part of the positions and weapons were destroyed. British imperialism's navy dared to be so rampant and colluded with the Kuomintang reactionaries to provoke the Chinese people and the People's Liberation Army, intruding into the People's Liberation Army's defense zone to fire and attack, directly participating in the Chinese civil war, causing huge losses to the People's Liberation Army. The British imperialist government must bear full responsibility. The Kuomintang reactionaries have always colluded with American imperialism to launch wars and slaughter compatriots. Now, as their doomsday approaches, they have once again colluded with the British imperialist navy to penetrate deep into the Yangtze River, attempting to prevent the People's Liberation Army from crossing the river. This kind of treasonous and cruel act must be thoroughly settled.

　　国民党勾结英舰向我联合进攻
  　我军战胜阻挠奋勇渡江
    英舰直接参加中国内战英政府应负全责
    【新华社长江前线二十二日二十四时电】在镇江江阴段的渡江作战中，人民解放军曾于二十日及二十一日战胜英国帝国主义和国民党的大队军舰的联合进攻，这件事值得全国人民极大注意。事情的经过是这样的：当二十日我军攻击北岸敌桥头据点及江中许多洲岛准备大举渡江的时候，除和国民党陆军作战外，还要和国民党的海军作战。二十日上午，有两艘敌舰由东向西开来，向我泰兴县西北扬中县正北名叫口岸的北岸桥头阵地发炮，其目的是阻我向中心洲进攻及展开船只渡江。我军炮兵当即奋勇还击，敌舰一艘被毁，不久下沉。另一艘负伤，向西驶至镇江附近大部下沉。此时又有一艘敌舰从镇江方面向东开进，至口岸附近向我阵地发炮，我再还击，又将该舰击伤，该舰后向下游驶去。二十一日上午，又由东面来了两舰，一大一小。此时我即首先发炮，使其不敢迫近，又将该两舰击伤，狼狈向来路江阴方面逃去。由于这一次向敌舰作战胜利，方才将敌舰阻我渡江之计划打破，二十一日下午方得大举渡江。当我军和上述五艘敌舰作战时，江中尚泊有几艘敌舰和上述五舰相距不远，亦参加战斗，惟畏我炮火，不甚积极，直到二十一日夜间，我军还以为上述各舰都是国民党的军舰。到了二十二日，从各方面收集情报，方才知道上述诸舰中，竟有四艘是英国军舰。四艘英舰中，有三艘在战败后向江阴以东逃去，大概是逃往上海。另一艘英舰现搁浅于镇江附近不远的江中。要待我军占领镇江后才能将详细情形查清楚。在和上述诸舰作战的过程中，人民解放军伤亡二百五十二人，阵地及武器被毁一部。英帝国主义的海军竟敢如此横行无忌，和国民党反动派勾结一起，向中国人民和人民解放军挑衅，闯入人民解放军防区发炮攻击，直接参加中国内战。致使人民解放军遭受巨大损失，英帝国主义政府必须担负全部责任。国民党反动派历来勾结美帝国主义发动战争，屠杀同胞，现当日暮途穷之际，又复勾结英帝国主义的大队海军深入长江，图阻人民解放军渡江，此种卖国残民罪行，必须彻底清算。
