　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 6th: Due to the Kuomintang reactionary government's policy of continuing the counter-revolutionary war, the economic collapse in the Kuomintang-controlled areas has further developed. According to reports from various sources on April 4th: (1) The Kuomintang reactionary government's military and administrative expenses are rapidly expanding. The pseudo-Minister of Finance, Liu Gongyun, admitted in a report to the Monetary and Financial Committee of the pseudo-Legislative Yuan that the Nanjing government's expenditure for this month will be 800 billion yuan (referring to pseudo-Gold Yuan notes, same below), while the expenditure for February this year was over 40 billion yuan, and the expenditure for the first twenty days of March was still only 159.4 billion yuan. The pseudo-government's expenditure has expanded twenty times in two months. Liu Gongyun confessed that the speed of the printing press cannot keep up with inflation. Due to the devaluation of the pseudo-currency, the pseudo-government's income is decreasing day by day. The proportion of its reliance on the excessive issuance of Gold Yuan paper money to make up for the deficit is increasing day by day. Liu Gongyun also revealed that after the Kuomintang reactionary government issued large-denomination Gold Yuan notes of 5,000 yuan and 10,000 yuan from the 1st of this month, it is now printing new large-denomination Gold Yuan notes with denominations of 50,000 yuan and 100,000 yuan. (2) With the acceleration of the inflation of pseudo-Gold Yuan notes, prices in the Kuomintang-controlled areas continue to soar. In the Shanghai market, rice has risen to 180,000 yuan per shi (unit of dry measure), which was 70,000 yuan ten days ago. Flour and other daily necessities have also risen to new heights. The general price level in the first three months of this year has risen more than 32 times, of which food prices in the fourth week of March alone soared by 8.355 times. (3) Due to inflation and soaring prices, Shanghai's industry is facing total collapse. Industries such as cotton spinning, dyeing and weaving, paper making, and cigarette manufacturing are shutting down and reducing production. Of the original 100 or so cigarette companies, only 30 or so are still operating. People in Shanghai's industrial circles say that if Shanghai's industry drags on for another month, it will completely collapse.

　　国民党疯狂扩大军费
    伪金圆券加速膨胀
　  沪工厂停工减产面临总崩溃
    【新华社北平六日电】由于国民党反动政府采取继续反革命战争的政策，国民党统治区经济崩溃的情势已进一步发展。据本月四日各方电讯报道：（一）国民党反动政府的军政费正在急剧扩大。伪财政部长刘攻芸在伪立法院货币与财政委员会的报告中承认，本月份南京政府的开支将为八千亿元（指伪金圆券，下同），而今年二月份的开支为四百余亿元，三月份头二十天的开支亦尚仅为一千五百九十四亿元。伪政府的开支在两个月内已膨胀二十倍。刘攻芸供认：印钞机的速度赶不上通货膨胀。由于伪币的贬值，伪政府的收入日益减少。其依靠滥发金圆券纸币以为弥补的比例则日益增大。刘攻芸并透露，国民党反动政府于本月一日起发行五千元及一万元大额金圆券之后，现在正在印刷票面五万元及十万元的新的大额金圆券。（二）在伪金圆券加速度膨胀的情况下，国民党统治区物价继续狂涨不已。在上海市场，大米每市石已涨到十八万元，十天之前尚为七万元。面粉以及其他日用必需品亦涨至新的高度。本年头三个月一般物价水平已上涨三十二倍以上，其中食物类价格在三月份第四周一周之内就暴涨了八点三五五倍。（三）由于通货膨胀与物价飞涨，上海的工业已面临全部崩溃。棉纺、染织、造纸、卷烟等工业正纷纷停工、减产，原来情况较好的卷烟业一百余家亦仅有三十余家开工。上海工业界人士称：沪市工业再拖一个月将全部崩溃。
