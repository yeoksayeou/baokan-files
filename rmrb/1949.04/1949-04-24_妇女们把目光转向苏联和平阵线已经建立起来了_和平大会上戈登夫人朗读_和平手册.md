Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, 23rd. Paris dispatch: At the World Congress of Advocates for Peace meeting in Paris on the 21st, Madame Gordon, President of the Women's International Democratic Federation, delivered a speech, reading some moving words written by French women in the "Peace Handbook" circulating throughout France. She said: Women had said at the First World Women's Congress that they were not limited to describing the horrors experienced by themselves and their relatives and friends. Now, the Women's International Democratic Federation unites 80 million women. The Marshall Plan and the North Atlantic Treaty have increased the threat to peace. Less than four years after the end of the war, in all the Marshallized countries that are still in ruins, reconstruction work has been interrupted, children lack schools, families lack homes, and unemployment is increasing. In all countries, women have risen to defend peace. They will never sacrifice the lives of their children to protect the interests of American trusts. Women all over the world are turning their eyes to the Soviet Union—the strongest defender of peace. Madame Gordon concluded: Women yearn for a united front for peace, a front that has already been established. They warmly welcome participating in this Peace Congress, and the voice of the people will resound throughout the world.

　　妇女们把目光转向苏联和平阵线已经建立起来了
    和平大会上戈登夫人朗读“和平手册”
    【新华社北平二十三日电】巴黎讯：在巴黎世界拥护和平大会二十一日的会议上，世界民主妇联主席戈登夫人发表演说，朗读法国妇女们在流传全法的“和平手册”中写的一些动人的话。她说：妇女们曾在第一次世界妇女代表大会上讲过，她们并不仅仅限于叙述她们自己和她们亲友们所经历的恐怖。现在，世界民主妇联团结了八千万妇女。马歇尔计划和北大西洋公约增加了对和平的威胁。战争结束还不到四年，然而在仍然残破不堪的一切马歇尔化国家中，恢复工作业已中断，儿童缺乏学校，家庭缺乏房屋，失业增加。在一切国家中，妇女们已奋起保卫和平。他们决不为了保护美国托辣斯的利益而牺牲她们的孩子们的生命。全世界妇女把目光转向苏联—最强大的和平保卫者。戈登夫人结语说：妇女们渴望争取和平统一阵线，这种阵线已经建立起来了。她们热烈地欢迎参加这个和平大会，人民的声音将响澈全世界。
