[Chahar News] Xiling Farm has cultivated new wheat varieties. A, the creation of new spring wheat has been basically completed. This type of wheat was first tested at Lingshou Farm in 1943. It is the third type of wheat produced by artificial hybridization of spring and autumn wheat, and is named "New Spring Wheat." It has high yield, is cold-resistant, and has a short growing period. Both in quantity and quality, it exceeds spring wheat. Further advanced tests will be carried out this year, and it can be promoted after a large number of varieties are available. B, Six new wheat varieties have been cultivated. This experiment used "Six Thousand Spikes" wheat from different regions (preliminary experiments began in Shuling in 1942). After seven years of careful research and selection and elimination at four experimental farms, the entire experimental process was completed. Six of the best strains, 2059, 1112, 4099, 585.C, 424, and 2191, have been cultivated, and their yields all exceed the standard variety "72" wheat. Among them, "2059" is the best. In this year's experiment, it is also planned to cross autumn wheat with wild wheat to produce a third type of wheat that retains the excellent quality of autumn wheat and the strong vitality, disease resistance, and strong propagation of perennial roots of wild wheat. If this experiment is successful, then general land can be planted. In addition, two conclusions have been reached on the method of cultivation: small American "Si Zi Cotton" does not need pruning, which not only saves labor but also increases yield; millet seedling cultivation does not affect yield and can prevent drought and resist famine.

　　察省西陵农场育成小麦新品种
    【察哈尔讯】西陵农场育成小麦新品种。甲、新春小麦的创造已基本完成。此种小麦，在一九四三年开始试验于灵寿农场，以春、秋两种小麦使用人工杂交所产生的第三种小麦，命名为“新春小麦”。产量大、耐寒，且生长期短，在数量上质量上都超过了春小麦。待今年再作高级试验，有了大量品种后即可推广。乙、六种小麦新品种育成。该项试验系以不同地区之“六千穗”小麦（一九四二年开始初级试验于寿灵），经过了七年四个试验场的精细研究，选择淘汰，完成了全部试验过程。育成了２０５９，１１１２，４０９９，５８５．Ｃ，４２４，２１９１六种最优良品系，其产量都超过了标准品种“七二”号小麦。其中尤以“２０５９”号为最佳。在今年试验中，并计划以秋小麦与野生小麦杂交，使之产生第三种小麦，保有秋小麦的品质优良性和野生小麦的强生性、抗病性及宿根的强大繁殖性。该项试验若获成功，则一般土地均可种植。另外在耕作方法上，也得到了两个结论：小美“斯字棉”不打杈，不但省工，而且可以增加产量；粟作育苗栽培，不影响产量，并可防旱御荒。
