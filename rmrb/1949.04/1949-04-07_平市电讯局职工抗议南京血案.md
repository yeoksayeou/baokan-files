　　Ping City Telecommunications Bureau Workers
  　Protest Nanjing Massacre
    [Our Newspaper] The workers of the Beiping City Telecommunications Bureau are protesting the Nanjing reactionary government's crime of massacring students. The workers believe that: Just as the Nanjing reactionary government sent representatives to Beiping for negotiations, the false peaceful face of the Nanjing reactionary government was exposed again. They said: "This massacre of students demanding true peace has given us another profound lesson. We will never be fooled by the Nanjing reactionary government. We must adhere to the eight peace conditions put forward by Chairman Mao and wipe out the reactionary group headed by Chiang Kai-shek."

    【本报讯】北平市电讯局职工抗议南京反动政府屠杀学生的罪行。职工们认为：正当南京反动政府派代表来平谈判的时候，南京反动政府假和平的鬼脸又暴露了，他们说：“这次屠杀要求实现真和平的学生，又深刻的给我们一个教训，我们绝不上南京反动政府的当，我们要坚持毛主席所提的八项和平条件，把以蒋介石为首的反动集团消灭干净。”
