　　[Chahar News] In Jianping, Jicha, Chabei, and other special districts, some counties are suffering from severe famine. The Chahar Provincial People's Government has allocated grain to organize disaster-stricken people to engage in production for self-salvation and issued specific instructions: (1) In areas severely affected by famine, it is necessary to establish and improve production and disaster relief committees to understand and grasp the disaster situation in various places at any time, and formulate specific famine relief measures based on the principles of "saving to prevent disaster, self-salvation through production, mutual assistance among the masses, and work-for-relief" in conjunction with local conditions. (2) Actively call on and mobilize the masses to plant more early-maturing crops, collect wild vegetables and leaves, preserve substitute foods, universally promote savings, conscientiously allocate and use agricultural loans, and organize the masses in disaster areas to engage in production for self-salvation. (3) Jianping Special District has called on all counties in relatively affluent areas to collect a spoonful of rice from each household; in mountainous areas that produce dates, it has called on each household to collect a pound of dates or collect bran and vegetables, etc., and use various methods to ensure that no one starves to death. Promote the spirit of mutual assistance and fraternity to achieve mutual aid. In areas severely affected by famine, permission is also granted to issue half a year's preferential treatment grain in advance to resettle particularly difficult revolutionary martyrs, soldiers, and workers' families so that they can engage in production.
　　[Hebei-Shandong-Henan Telegram] The 3rd, 5th, and 7th special districts on the south bank of the Yellow River in Hebei-Shandong-Henan have long suffered from the devastation of the Kuomintang bandit army. Last year, they suffered from floods and insect plagues, and this spring, they are experiencing a severe famine, and production is encountering great difficulties. For this reason, the Administrative Office has issued urgent instructions on production and disaster relief and fundraising and relief, pointing out that the basic principle of disaster relief is to first enlighten the masses' confidence and awareness in overcoming famine through production, implement self-salvation through production, and the solution of various difficulties in production should be organized by the disaster-stricken people themselves for mutual assistance, and government loan support is only an aid. According to the specific conditions of the disaster area, establish county and district disaster-stricken people's production and marketing cooperatives, and set up production and transportation loan offices with key points and plans in each county, implement cost loans for various side businesses, advance payment of goods, order raw materials, and exchange finished products for grain. The disaster-stricken people's products should be organized by the masses for transportation and self-sales. All public-run stores, organs, and disaster-stricken people's production and marketing cooperatives should open up sales channels for the disaster-stricken people's production. In production and disaster relief, organize manpower and animal power to launch surprise attacks on spring plowing and spring planting, and strive not to violate the agricultural season. Regarding fundraising and relief, the Administrative Office has now allocated 700,000 jin of relief grain, which has been distributed to the 3rd, 5th, and 7th special offices in Henan and the 2nd and 4th special offices in Hebei, and instructed each special office to specifically grasp and quickly distribute it to areas severely affected by the disaster. Special care should be given to the families of revolutionary martyrs, soldiers, and workers and the elderly, weak, orphaned, widowed, sick, and disabled who have no means of livelihood. Launch a "smoke one less pack of cigarettes" and "eat one less vegetable dish" savings-for-disaster-relief fundraising campaign, calling on all cadres to tighten their belts and make generous donations. Special care should be given to the poor among the families of revolutionary martyrs, soldiers, and workers in the disaster area. There should also be a planned and regular appropriate relief and timely condolences for the families of revolutionary martyrs, soldiers, and workers who have no production.
