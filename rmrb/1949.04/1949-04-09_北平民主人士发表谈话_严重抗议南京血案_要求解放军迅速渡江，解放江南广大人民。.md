Xinhua News Agency, North China, April 8th: Our reporter has interviewed democratic figures in Beiping in recent days regarding the Nanjing student massacre perpetrated by the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary clique. They all expressed strong protests against this incident. Li Jishen, Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, said: "Just as peace talks representatives are in Beiping for negotiations, the massacre of students occurred in the capital of the reactionary government. This incident has caused the people of the entire country to greatly doubt the sincerity of the Nanjing reactionary government in seeking peace. Since the reactionary government expressed its desire for peace, similar incidents have occurred repeatedly. For example, Comrade Wang Baozhen of our association, who is seventy years old, was arrested by reactionaries in Shanghai and subjected to torture, resulting in a broken arm. We believe that if some figures in the Nanjing reactionary government truly desire peace for the sake of the country and the people, they should immediately and completely sever ties with the Chiang Kai-shek clique, severely punish the murderers of the people, release all political prisoners, and join the ranks of the people!" Shen Junru, Standing Committee Member of the China Democratic League, said: "Nanjing is conducting peace talks on the one hand, while on the other hand, it is causing the tragedy of massacring the people. This proves their lack of sincerity in the peace talks. The Nanjing reactionary government should bear great responsibility for this tragedy. They should admit to the people of the whole country that this kind of massacre is a criminal act and immediately implement measures sufficient for the people of the whole country to understand; otherwise, it will be a major obstacle to the current peace talks!" Zhang Bojun, Standing Committee Member of the China Democratic League, pointed out: "The occurrence of the student massacre in the location of the Nanjing reactionary government fully exposes the extremely vicious reactionary nature of the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary secret agent clique in Nanjing. It has aroused greater hatred from the people of the whole country and further strengthened the determination of the people of the whole country to eliminate the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary secret agent clique." Huang Yanpei, Executive Director of the China Democratic National Construction Association, said: "The occurrence of the Nanjing massacre has made the people of the whole country even more disappointed in the Nanjing political situation. If the Nanjing reactionary government is sincere about peace talks, it should severely punish those who committed violence against the students!" Ma Xulun, Executive Director of the China Association for Promoting Democracy, said: "The Nanjing Kuomintang reactionary clique manufactured the Nanjing massacre. This is completely the same as Chiang Kai-shek's style of conducting peace talks on the one hand and massacring the people on the other in previous peace talks, reflecting their complete lack of sincerity in the peace talks. The Chinese People's Liberation Army should swiftly cross the Yangtze River to eliminate the forces of the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary clique and liberate the broad masses of people in southern Jiangsu." The famous revolutionary writer Mao Dun said: "Everyone understands that the so-called 'peace talks' of the reactionaries are a conspiracy, just an attempt to find a chance to catch their breath while dying. The students in Nanjing demanded real peace and exposed their conspiracy, so they were murdered by the reactionaries. Now only the People's Liberation Army can cross the river in force, completely defeat the reactionary clique, or they can surrender to the people, then there will be real peace."

　　北平民主人士发表谈话
  　严重抗议南京血案
    要求解放军迅速渡江，解放江南广大人民。
    【新华社华北八日电】记者连日就南京蒋介石反动集团屠杀学生事件访问此间民主人士，他们对于这一事件都表示严重的抗议。中国国民党革命委员会主席李济深说：“正当和谈代表来平谈判之际，在反动政府的首都却发生屠杀学生的暴行，这事件使全国人民对南京反动政府的求和诚意发生很大的怀疑。自从反动政府表示求和以来，类此事件屡屡发生，如本会王葆真同志年已七十，在沪被反动分子逮捕，并受酷刑，以致折臂。我们认为南京反动政府中某些人物，如果真是为国家为人民而希望和平的话，就应该立刻与蒋介石集团完全割断，严办屠杀人民的凶手，释放一切政治犯，并投到人民的队伍来！”中国民主同盟常委沈钧儒说：“南京一方面进行和谈，一方面却发生屠杀人民的惨剧，这证明他们对和谈缺乏诚意。南京反动政府对这一惨案应负很大的责任，他们应向全国人民承认此种屠杀是罪恶的行为，立即实施使全国人民足以谅解的措施，否则为目前和谈的一大障碍！”中国民主同盟常委章伯钧指出：“在南京反动政府的所在地发生屠杀学生的暴行，完全暴露出南京蒋介石反动特务集团穷凶极恶的反动本质，引起了全国人民的更大痛恨，更加强了全国人民消灭蒋介石反动特务集团的决心。”民主建国会常务理事黄炎培说：“南京惨案的发生，使全国民众对南京政局愈加失望。如果南京反动政府对和谈有诚意的话，应对这些向学生行凶的人们予以严重的惩罚！”中国民主促进会常务理事马叙伦说：“南京国民党反动集团制造南京惨案，这与蒋介石在历次进行和谈的时候，一方面和谈，一方面屠杀人民的作风完全一样，反映出他们对和谈毫无诚意。中国人民解放军应该迅速渡江，去消灭蒋介石反动集团的势力，解放江南广大人民。”著名革命文学家茅盾说：“每一个人都很明白，反动派的所谓‘和谈’就是一种阴谋，不过是在垂死时，想找一个喘息的机会。南京的学生们要求真正的和平，揭破了他们的阴谋，因此就被反动派下毒手屠杀。现在只有人民解放军大军过江，把反动集团彻底打垮，或他们向人民投降，才有真正的和平。”
