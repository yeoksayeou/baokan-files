　　In Memory of Mr. Li Dazhao
　　Shen Junru
　　In late February of this year, I traveled from Shenyang to Beiping. When the train passed through Changli, someone said that Leting in front was the hometown of Mr. Li Shouchang (Dazhao). I couldn't help but feel a sense of awe and a mix of emotions.

　　I thought at the time that since ancient times, all great reforms and great undertakings have been bought with the heads and blood of countless patriots and people of lofty ideals. If there had been no Mr. Li Shouchang and the thousands upon thousands of revolutionary martyrs who had sacrificed themselves for the cause of the people's liberation over the past thirty years, paving the way with their own flesh and blood, then today's earth-shattering great victory of the people's democratic revolution and the liberation of China's four to five hundred million working people would be unimaginable.

　　I never met Mr. Li Shouchang, but we are people of the same era, and Mr. Li was a visionary and pioneer of this era. Mr. Li was one of the initiators of the May Fourth New Culture Movement. Some intellectuals of the "May Fourth" era either betrayed the revolution halfway or tended towards passivity, but Mr. Li Shouchang was loyal to the liberation of the Chinese people from the beginning. Because he first recognized the era – the era of people's revolution, and he stood firm on the position – the position of the people. Afterwards, with a spirit of fearlessness, he resolutely fought for the interests of the workers and peasants until the very end.

　　As early as thirty-one years ago, the year after the victory of the October Revolution, Mr. Li Shouchang said: "The Russian revolution is merely a single tung leaf alarming the world with the coming of autumn. ... The victory of Bolshevism is the victory of the new spirit of common awakening in the hearts of all mankind in the 20th century!" (New Youth, Vol. 5, No. 5, "The Victory of Bolshevism"). He also said: "From now on, everyone in the world will be a commoner and a worker. ... If we want to be a commoner in the world, we should be a worker in the world." (Ibid., "The Victory of the Common People")

　　Now, this immortal prophecy of Mr. Li's is about to come true. The Chinese people's revolution is about to achieve a comprehensive and final victory, and the people of the world will soon achieve victory as well. He did not just talk empty words. He not only regarded himself as a worker, but also, together with other revolutionary pioneers, created a workers' party, the great Chinese Communist Party. Finally, he died for the working class and for the masses of the Chinese people. He gloriously sacrificed himself as the most heroic Communist Party member.

　　Mr. Li Shouchang's life should serve as the most outstanding model for Chinese revolutionary intellectuals, making us, the survivors, feel only ashamed.

　　Mr. Li Shouchang once told us: "Not only should the youthful me of today pursue and kill the white-haired me of yesterday, but also the youthful me of today should preemptively kill the white-haired me of tomorrow." This also means that intellectuals should strive to lay down the broken old baggage of the past, constantly strive for progress, faithfully serve the people, serve the workers and peasants, and dedicate themselves to the cause until their last breath. We must embrace this spirit of selflessness and impersonality, learn from Mr. Li Shouchang, and only then will we be qualified to commemorate him!

### 纪念李大钊先生

　　纪念李大钊先生
    沈钧儒
    今年二月下旬，我从沈阳来北平，火车经过昌黎的时候，有人说前面乐亭就是李守常（大钊）先生的故乡，我不禁肃然起敬，并且百感交集。
    我当时想，自古以来一切大改革，大事业，都是用无数志士仁人的头颅和鲜血换来的。假如没有李守常先生以及三十年以来千千万万杀身成仁的革命先烈，用他们自己的血肉，替人民解放事业铺平道路，那么，今天人民民主革命惊天动地的伟大胜利和全中国四五万万劳苦大众的翻身是不可设想的。
    我和李守常先生无一面之缘，但我们是同一个时代的人，而李先生却是这个时代的先知先觉。李先生是五四新文化运动的创导人之一，“五四”时代一部分知识分子，或则中途变节，或则趋向消极，但是李守常先生从开头就忠于中国人民的解放。因为他首先认清了时代——人民革命的时代，他站定了立场——人民大众的立场。以后他就以大无畏的精神，为工农大众的利益，坚决奋斗直到最后。
    早在三十一年前，当十月革命胜利的第二年，李守常先生就说：“俄国的革命，不过是使天下惊秋的一片桐叶罢了。……布尔什维主义的胜利，就是二十世纪世界人类人人心目中共同觉悟的新精神的胜利！”（新青年五卷五号“布尔什维主义的胜利”）。他又说：“今后世界的人人都成了庶民，也都成了工人。……我们要想在世界上当一个庶民，应该在世界上当一个工人。”（同上“庶民的胜利”）
    现在李先生这一不朽的预言，已经快要应验了。中国人民革命快要得到全面的最后的胜利，全世界人民不久也要得到胜利。他并没有说空话，他不但把自己当作工人，而且和其他的革命先进，共同创造了工人政党，伟大的中国共产党。最后他为了工人阶级，为了中国人民大众而殉身，他作为一个最英勇的共产党员而光荣牺牲。
    李守常先生的一生，应当作为中国革命知识分子的最杰出的模范，使我们后死者感觉到只有惭愧。
    李守常先生曾经告诉我们：“不仅以今日青春之我，追杀昨日白首之我，并宜以今日青春之我，预杀来日白首之我。”这也是说，知识分子应当努力放下过去的破烂的旧包袱，不断争取进步，忠实为人民服务，为工农服务，鞠躬尽瘁，死而后已。我们要抱定这种忘我无我的精神，去学习李守常先生，我们才有资格来纪念他！
