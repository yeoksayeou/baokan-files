Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, 17th. Polish News Agency, Warsaw dispatch: Frédéric Joliot-Curie, Chairman of the World Peace Congress Preparatory Committee, President of the France-Poland Friendship Association, world authority on atomic energy theory, and famous French physicist, in an interview with a Polish News Agency reporter stationed in Paris, spoke at length about the significance of the World Congress of Supporters of Peace, saying: Only a very small number of people are provoking a new war. But they still have power now. At international conferences, they oppose disarmament and the prohibition of atomic weapons, and they conclude aggressive military agreements with vassal states. The problem now is that many people do not sufficiently recognize the activities of the war-mongers. On the other hand, it is very exciting that hundreds of millions of people have already declared their support for the Peace Congress, that they truly recognize this danger and are determined to maintain peace. Everything proves that they will win victory. Speaking of the tasks of the Congress, Joliot-Curie said: We will emphasize the need to resolve disputes through negotiation; but if they are unwilling to negotiate, they will expose themselves as enemies of peace. We will oppose the insane arms race. We must condemn actions that hinder normal trade between European countries. We must emphasize the importance of national independence and sovereignty. The Peace Congress must establish a permanent body to implement the decisions of the Congress and should establish a strong world front for the defense of peace. Joliot-Curie stressed that the solidarity of the French and Polish people is very important in the situation where West Germany is rapidly becoming a war arsenal with the extensive assistance of US imperialism.
    When asked about the significance of atomic energy in aggressive war and the role of atomic energy in consolidating peace, Joliot-Curie replied: To say that atomic weapons can achieve a rapid victory with a blitzkrieg is nonsense, a lie deliberately spread by those who aim to create war madness. It can be determined that atomic weapons, despite their destructive power, will not play a decisive role in a world war. The war-mongers probably know this, and it is probably this fact that will prevent them from engaging in crazy actions. In a prolonged and exhausting war, such actions can easily turn against them. On the other hand, applying atomic energy to peaceful purposes will be of decisive importance for increasing the prosperity of the whole world. Using atomic energy for such purposes will create unprecedented prosperity, happiness and freedom for mankind within one or two decades. We believe that many Americans share our views. The growing scale of the peace movement of American citizens proves this.
    Xinhua News Agency Note: Joliot was originally named Frédéric Joliot. Only after marrying Irène Curie, the daughter of Madame Curie, the female scientist who discovered radium, was the name Curie added to his original surname Joliot to commemorate Madame Curie. Now both Joliot and his wife are initiators of the Peace Congress.

　　原子能理论权威居里谈和平运动
  　世界人民将赢得胜利
    战贩侈谈原子战只是一派谎言
    【新华社北平十七日电】波兰通讯社华沙讯：世界和平大会筹委会主席、法波友好协会会长和世界原子能理论权威、法国著名物理学家斐德烈·约利奥·居里在接见波兰通讯社驻巴黎记者时畅谈世界拥护和平大会的意义称：挑拨新战争的只是很少数的人。但是他们现在还有力量。在国际会议上，他们反对裁军和禁止原子武器，他们与附庸国家缔结侵略性军事协定。现在的问题是还有许多人对战争贩子的活动认识不够。另一方面，非常令人兴奋的是，数亿人民已经宣告他们拥护和平大会，他们确实认识到了这一危险，并决心维护和平。一切事情都证明他们将赢得胜利。居里谈到大会的任务时说：我们将强调以谈判解决纠纷问题的必要；但要是不愿意谈判，就暴露他们自己是和平的敌人。我们将反对疯狂的军备竞争。我们必须谴责阻碍欧洲各国之间正常贸易的行动。我们必须强调国家独立与主权的重要性。和平大会必须建立常设机构，执行大会的决定，并且应该建立强大的世界保卫和平阵线。居里强调在西德藉美帝国主义的广泛援助而迅速成为战争兵工厂的情形下，法波两国人民的团结，十分重要。
    当问到原子能在侵略战争中的意义及原子能在巩固和平中的作用时，居里答称：说原子武器能够以闪击战取得迅速的胜利，乃是一种胡说，这是那些以制造战争狂为目的的人们故意散布的谎话。可以确定的说，原子武器尽管有破坏力量，但却不会在世界战争中起决定作用。战争贩子们很可能知道这点，也很可能正是这个事实将阻止他们从事疯狂的行动。在持久的和消耗的战争中，这种行动很容易转而使他们自己不利。另一方面，把原子能应用于和平用途，对于增加全世界的繁荣，却将有决定的重要性。把原子能用于这样的目的，一二十年之内，将为人类造成空前的繁荣，幸福和自由。我们相信，许多美国人和我们有同样的意见。美国公民和平运动规模的日益扩大，可以证明这一点。
    新华社按：居里原名菲德烈·约利奥，自与发现镭的女科学家居里夫人之女伊兰尼·居里结婚后，才在他的原姓约利奥之外，加上居里一姓，用来纪念居里夫人。现在居里夫妇都是和平大会的发起人。
