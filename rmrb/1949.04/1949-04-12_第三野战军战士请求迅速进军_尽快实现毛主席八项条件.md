Xinhua News Agency, Bengbu, 10th. The various units of the Third Field Army, preparing to advance into the Jiangnan region, have undergone thorough training for a sufficient period and are in unprecedentedly high spirits, requesting a swift advance to realize Chairman Mao Zedong's eight peace conditions as soon as possible. Since the victory of the Huaihai Campaign, the units have been conducting large-scale training between the Yangtze and Huai rivers. The first step was to conduct current affairs studies. One unit adopted methods such as "calculating family wealth" and "comparing strengths" to mobilize everyone to calculate the strength of the Kuomintang reactionaries and the People's Liberation Army, and to compare them with each other. This made the soldiers clearly realize that the strength of the People's Liberation Army surpassed that of the Kuomintang reactionaries in all aspects. They also recognized more clearly that the purpose of the defeated Kuomintang reactionaries in playing peace conspiracies was to seek a respite, reorganize their forces, and stage a comeback. Subsequently, the unit conducted "calculating blood debts," calculating the oppression and persecution of each individual and their relatives by the Kuomintang reactionaries. The Seventh Company of the unit calculated that 21 people were conscripted by the Kuomintang reactionaries, 59 were beaten, 7 were crippled, 29 were persecuted to death, 17 were forced to lose their families, and 112 mu of land were seized. During the calculations, many people recalled their new and old grievances and cried bitterly. Everyone resolutely demanded that the Kuomintang reactionaries be thoroughly eliminated, the war criminals be punished, and Chairman Mao Zedong's eight peace conditions be realized. After the current affairs studies, the units conducted advance education, studying urban policies, new area policies, and discipline. After these trainings and exercises, the commanders and fighters of the units could not wait to write letters or personally request the commanders to advance.

　　第三野战军战士请求迅速进军
  　尽快实现毛主席八项条件
    【新华社蚌埠十日电】准备进军江南的第三野战军各部经过了充分时间的整训，士气空前昂扬，纷纷要求迅速进军，尽快实现毛泽东主席八项和平条件。各部自淮海战役胜利结束后，即在江淮之间进行大整训。首先是进行时事学习，某部采用了“算家当”、“比力量”等方法，发动大家来计算国民党反动派和人民解放军的力量，并互相比较，使战士们明确认识了人民解放军的力量在各方面都超过了国民党反动派，也更认清了被打败的国民党反动派玩弄和平阴谋的目的是在求得喘息机会，重整力量，以便卷土重来。接着该部又进行“算血债”，算国民党反动派对每个人和自己亲属的压迫和残害。该部七连算出：被国民党反动派抓丁的二十一人，被打的五十九人，打残废的七人，被迫害死的二十九人，被逼得家破人亡的十七人，被强占土地一百十二亩。在计算中，许多人都回忆起新仇旧恨而痛哭失声，大家都坚决要求彻底消灭国民党反动派，惩办战争罪犯，实现毛泽东主席的八项和平条件。经过时事学习后，各部进行了进军教育，学习城市政策、新区政策和纪律等。经过了这些整训和练兵，各部指战员即急不可待地纷纷上书或者亲自向指挥员请求进军。
