　　Ping City Public Factory Representatives Discuss Trade Union Organization Issues
    [This Newspaper's Report] The Organization Department of the Preparatory Committee of the Trade Union of Beiping City, convened a meeting of representatives from more than ten units, including the People's Printing Factory and the 70th Ordnance Factory, at 2:00 pm on the 15th of this month. Comrade Zhang Hongshun first gave a brief report on the recent situation of trade union organizations in various factories. According to the spirit of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, and after everyone's discussion, the following two issues were mainly clarified: First, regarding the issue of reviewing membership. In some factories, methods such as review by the preparatory committee and first and second batch reviews were adopted, which aroused dissatisfaction among the majority of workers and staff, and also resulted in the phenomenon of a few bad elements sneaking into the organization because the preparatory committee had few people and a lot of work and had no time to conduct thorough understanding. Therefore, in the future, the method of members reviewing members should be adopted. That is, first organize a review committee, and distribute the list of members introduced to each group for extensive and in-depth discussion and identification; if it is considered that someone does not meet the qualifications for membership, they should raise their opinions. In order to prevent malpractice such as favoritism, an opinion box is set up, where anonymous opinions can be submitted. This method saves time and effort in the review and is relatively strict. It has been adopted by some factories. Second, regarding the issue of the proportion of workers and staff members in the election of the trade union committee. This issue is not clear in many places. For example, some places believe that if there are more staff members, they should occupy the majority, resulting in disunity among workers and staff. In the future, attention should be paid to the leading position of workers. In the past, it was of course wrong for workers to organize trade unions behind closed doors and not allow staff members to participate. Therefore, in the future election work of trade unions, this issue should be explained publicly and discussed before the election, and then the election should be carried out.

　　平市公营工厂代表讨论职工会组织问题
    【本报讯】北平市职工筹备委员会组织部，于本月十五日下午二时召集人民印制厂，七十兵工厂等十余单位代表会议。首由张洪顺同志对最近一个时期各厂组织职工会的情况作了简单的报告，根据市总工会的精神，经过大家讨论，主要明确了下面两个问题。第一、关于审查会员问题。在某些厂中曾采用了由筹委会审查与第一批审查第二批等方式，致引起了大多数职工的不满，同时也发生了因筹委会人少事繁，无暇精密进行了解，而使少数坏分子混进组织的现象。因此今后应采用会员审查会员的方式。即首先组织审查委员会，将所介绍的会员名单，发到各小组，进行广泛深入的讨论鉴别；如认为某人不够会员资格，即提出意见。又为防止情面等弊病，特设立意见箱，可投不记名的意见书。这一方式使审查省时省力，又比较严密。已为某些工厂所采用。第二关于选举职工委员会中，工人与职员所占比例数的问题。这一问题，很多地方不够明确，如有些地方认为职员多，就应占多数，结果形成职工间不团结的现象。今后应注意工人的领导地位。过去工人关上门组织工会，不让职员参加，当然也是不对的。因此在今后职工会的选举工作中，对这一问题应在选举前首先公开说明。并进行讨论，然后进行选举。
