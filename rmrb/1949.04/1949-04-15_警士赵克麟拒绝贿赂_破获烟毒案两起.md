　　Policeman Zhao Kelin Refuses Bribe
  　Solves Two Opium Cases
    [Ping City News] On the 5th of this month, Zhao Kelin, a policeman from the 16th police station of Ping City, cooperated with Ma Shiying and Ma Shaiyu to search the home of Pan Shouzhu, the wife of opium dealer Sima Zhuliang, at No. 8 Bei'an Lane, Dazhalan, Inner District 2. They found a small basin containing one catty and two taels of raw opium, fifteen opium bubbles, eighteen silver yuan, and one package each of opium bubbles, white flour, eucha, tin dross, medicinal pills, raw soil, and crushed opium bubbles. When Sima Zhuliang saw all the drugs being seized, he immediately tried to bribe Zhao Kelin with five silver dollars, saying, "We are from the same area, we are all good people, why did you bring them here?" He was immediately rejected by Zhao, and both the person and the drugs were taken to the sub-bureau. It was also discovered that Nian Kuihan, Lin Changying, and Nian Zishu, a father and two sons residing at No. 2 Zaolin Courtyard, 16th District, were all opium addicts. In the above two cases, the more serious offenders (Sima Zhuliang and Pan Shouzhu) were sent to the People's Court for processing, while the less serious offenders were immediately educated and released, but they guaranteed that they would no longer use opium.
