[Jizhong Telegram] Some village cadres in Xianxian, Renqiu, and other counties have established a rotating duty system to strengthen work without neglecting production. In Nanzhuang Village, Xianxian, the 38 village cadres were mostly busy with work every day, which affected production. At the same time, the work was sometimes tight and sometimes loose, which reduced work efficiency. In addition, there was a phenomenon of uneven workload. For example, Feng Xishan, the director of the production committee in the village, was busy with work every day and had no time for production. However, some cadres were just burying their heads in their own production and ignoring the work. In order to solve the contradiction between the production and work of village cadres, Nanzhuang Village in the first district of Xianxian, Niucun Village and Dongguanzhang Village in Renqiu, and Chenjiazhuang Village in the fifth district of Ningjin have all worked out some methods. Nanzhuang Village in the first district of Xianxian stipulated the following six methods: (1) Cadres take turns on duty. Each day, one cadre and one villager are on duty; the villager is responsible for sending letters, and the cadre is responsible for promoting work and taking care of odd jobs. When changing shifts, the procedures must be explained to the next shift. (2) It is stipulated that each department will hold a meeting every night to report and review production work; a village affairs meeting will be held every five days to study and solve problems in production work. (3) If a cadre has special urgent matters and cannot be on duty, he will be pushed down according to the shift order. The team headquarters is responsible for recording work points, and work points will be settled every half month. Those with fewer work points will be compensated, and the duty roster will be posted in the village office for rotation. (4) If going to a meeting outside the village for more than two days, the cadres at home will be responsible for doing work for them as a work point transfer, so that they can attend the meeting with peace of mind. (5) If there is urgent work that requires summoning all village cadres to gather, a gong will be struck as a signal. (6) Those who do not follow the methods will be criticized at the meeting of all cadres. This method has been implemented since March 24. Before these six methods were stipulated, they were first studied and prepared by county and district cadres and branch secretaries. On the evening of March 21, a forum of all village cadres was held, and the cadres who were not actively working were educated. Then everyone had a casual discussion, and finally a show of hands was used to vote. After the regulations were made, the general cadres were in higher spirits than before. Feng Xirui said in connection with his own experience: "Last year, after doing some work, I didn't want to go to production until noon. This year, I can do so much more work!" Nan Rongxin, who was not active in the past, also said: "I will guarantee to adhere to the system in the future!"

　　任邱等县若干村庄干部
  　建轮流值班制
  　加强工作不误生产
    【冀中电】献交、任邱等县有些村庄的村干部，为了加强工作不误生产，建立了轮流值班制。献交南庄村的三十八个村干部，大都每天忙于工作，生产受到影响；同时工作忽紧忽松，又减低了工作效率；另外还有忙闲悬殊的现象。如该村生产委员会主任冯西山，天天忙工作，没有生产时间；可是有的干部则只是闷着头搞个人的生产，对工作不闻不问。为解决村干部生产和工作的矛盾，献交一区南庄、任邱牛村和东关章村，以及宁晋五区陈家庄，都研究出一些办法，献交一区南庄规定了以下六项办法：（一）干部轮流值日。每天值日的有干部一人村民一人；村民负责送信，干部负责推动工作，照顾零星事务。换班时，要向下一班交待手续。（二）规定每晚开各部门碰头会一次，汇报和检讨生产工作；五天一次村务会，研究解决生产工作中的问题。（三）干部因有特殊急事不能值日时，依班次往下推，中队部负责记工，半月一齐工，工少者补工，并把值日名单贴在村公所，以便轮流推动。（四）出村开会在两天以上者，由在家的干部负责给做活，作为拨工，使其开会安心。（五）如有紧急工作需要召集全村干部集合时，打锣为号。（六）不按办法执行者，全体干部会上进行批评。该办法已于三月二十四日实行。这六项办法规定前，先由县区干部和支部书记研究准备。三月二十一日晚，又召开全村干部座谈会，对个别不积极工作的干部进行了教育，然后大家漫谈讨论，最后经过举手表决。规定以后，一般干部，比以前情绪高了，冯西瑞联系自己的经验说：“去年作一会工作，天不到晌午也就不愿意生产去了，今年这样，得多做多少活呀！”过去不积极工作的南荣信也说：“以后保证坚持制度！”
