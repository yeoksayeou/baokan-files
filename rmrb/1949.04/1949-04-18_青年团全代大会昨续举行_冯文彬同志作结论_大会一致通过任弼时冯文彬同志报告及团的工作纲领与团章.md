　　Youth League National Congress Continues Yesterday
  　Comrade Feng Wenbin Delivers Conclusion
    Congress Unanimously Approves Reports by Comrades Ren Bishi and Feng Wenbin, as well as the League's Program of Work and Constitution
    [Ping City News] The First National Congress of the China New Democratic Youth League, after five days of intense and enthusiastic reports and discussions, concluded yesterday morning (the 17th) with a conclusion delivered by Comrade Feng Wenbin. He first praised the congress as an unprecedentedly united one in the history of the Chinese youth movement, resulting from the correct leadership of the CCP Central Committee, particularly the Central Secretariat and Chairman Mao's extraordinary concern and attention to the Youth League, and the concerted efforts of all. After explaining the basic lessons of the history of the youth movement, he continued: A correct start in building the League requires earnest and responsible perseverance. League building must come from various revolutionary struggles and revolutionary work, various construction undertakings, as well as learning movements and ideological advancement movements. It must be done openly, step-by-step, planned, and with leadership. Once the League is established, it must have correct working principles and content, sufficient cadres, and conduct work under the strong leadership of the Party. He also explained how to implement the spirit of the congress into practical work, saying: This congress has made various correct resolutions and reports, but this is only the beginning of the work, and it is even more important to actually do the work well. Finally, he said that the Youth League should fight for uniting and educating the younger generation. In the future, the focus of the Youth League's work will be in the cities, and the work among young workers in the cities is of paramount importance.
    The congress, amidst warm applause, unanimously approved Comrade Ren Bishi's political report, Comrade Feng Wenbin's report and conclusion on the tasks and work of the Youth League, and the League's Program of Work and Constitution. It also resolved to send telegrams of respect to the CCP Central Committee and Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, the Chinese People's Liberation Army, the All-Union Leninist Communist Youth League of the Soviet Union and Soviet youth, and the Korean Democratic Youth League and Korean youth. With unparalleled excitement, the congress listened to the Presidium reading the inscriptions given to the congress by Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu.
    In the afternoon, a preliminary election of members and alternate members of the Youth League Central Committee was held. The formal election is scheduled for this morning, and the closing ceremony of the congress will be held in the afternoon.
