　　Agricultural Situation in North China in February and March
　　Agricultural Production Increase Campaign Unfolds
　　Deviations Occurring in Some Areas Should Be Swiftly Corrected
　　[Report from this newspaper] The central focus of rural production in North China during February and March was to mobilize for full-year production and to prepare for all sowing work. Based on the North China Government's agricultural and forestry conference in January, which determined the region's production tasks—requiring an increase of 7.5 million shi of food grains, 130 million jin of cotton, and 930 million jin of oil crops compared to last year—various production mobilization meetings (including labor models and cadres) were convened in all areas around mid-to-late February. By the end of February, these arrangements had generally reached the villages. In specific implementation, the Party and government leadership at all levels mainly addressed the following issues:

　　Loan Distribution and Promotion of Special Crops
　　First, based on the loan plans issued by the North China Government and the requirements for promoting special crops, all areas specifically carried out the work of distributing loans and seeds. The Jidong Administrative Office has already loaned out 397,000 jin of cotton seeds, 636,000 jin of peanut seeds, 1,091,000 jin of spring wheat seeds, and 60,000 jin of sweet potato seedlings. The Chahar Provincial Government, starting from February 28th, issued agricultural loans totaling 42.5 million RMB. The Jinzhong Trading Company purchased 370,000 jin of seeds from outside the region. All areas also vigorously organized the masses to borrow loans to solve various production problems. For example, the No. 2 Hydraulic Power Promotion Society in Jizhong supported farmers in ordering 110 large waterwheels and 102 small waterwheels. Jiyuan County in the Taiyue District allocated 1,000 shi of grain to help farmers manage rivers and open canals, turning 5,000 mu of watered land into fertile fields. Second, efforts were made to vigorously address farmers' livestock difficulties. Currently, the number of livestock in various areas is increasing. For example, statistics from 1,259 villages in 19 counties including Licheng, Shahe, Zanhuang, Heshun, Zuoquan, Linxian, Wu'an, Wuxiang, and Lucheng in Taihang showed an increase of 24,204 heads of livestock in February, averaging about 18 heads per village. The entire Taiyue District has purchased more than 3,000 heads of livestock from pastoral areas. The Jinzhong Yuci State-owned Tongtai Store and the Jinyu Public-Private Joint Store and other organizations also purchased more than 140 heads of livestock for farmers.

　　Helping Farmers Organize to Solve Livestock and Fertilizer Difficulties
　　Farmers in Chicheng County, Chahar Province, have also recently purchased livestock in large quantities with the government's assistance. For example, 15 households in Nandazhuang bought 12 cattle. Achievements have also been made in breeding livestock in various areas. For example, Guangzong County in Jinnan has 9,001 cattle, 135 mules and donkeys, and 12 horses, including 2,650 female animals and 11 breeding bulls. Currently, 356 cattle have been mated, and 208 are confirmed pregnant. Third, all areas have emphasized superior varieties, pesticides, and fertilization. For example, Jizhong has convened agricultural meetings to study and formulate annual promotion plans. The 11th Special District of the region has established a promotion network for superior varieties. The Jiluyu Administrative Office has designated six American cotton cultivation areas, covering approximately 33,000 mu, planning to sow 100,000 jin of 2B-grade "S" cotton. Various areas are currently focusing on guiding the masses to experiment with sowing. Secondly, in addition to mobilizing farmers to accumulate large amounts of fertilizer, many regions are specifically organizing and assisting the restoration and expansion of oil presses and flour mills, and purchasing oil cake, fertilizer powder, and ferrous sulfate through promotion societies and production cooperatives to sell or loan to farmers. Some areas (such as Yushe in Taihang) have paid more attention to solving the fertilizer shortage for revolutionary martyrs' families, emphasizing that in order to do a good job in supporting the military, it is necessary to ensure that military families do not lack fertilizer, so that they can achieve the same harvest as the masses during the wheat harvest season.

　　Sufficient Prior Preparation to Help Disaster Victims with Spring Plowing
　　Fourth, attention was paid to disaster relief work. This year, grain and seed shortages in disaster areas such as Chahar, Jinzhong, Jizhong, and Jinnan are a very serious problem. However, all regions made sufficient preparations in advance. For example, the Jinnan Administrative Office has issued 1.75 million jin of grain and 15 million RMB to the disaster-stricken third and fourth special districts to help farmers in disaster areas with spring plowing and prevent spring famine. The Chahar Provincial Government has allocated 10,000 shi of grain to disaster victims in the severely affected Jicha and Jianping sub-districts to alleviate the severe spring famine in some areas. After the promotion societies in Xianxian, Gaoyang, and Wenxin counties in the Jizhong flood-stricken area loaned out approximately 37,000 jin of wheat seeds, the farmers' seed shortage was completely resolved.

　　From the perspective of agricultural timing, this period is mainly for preparing for sowing. Field work mainly includes transporting manure, sowing spring wheat, irrigating, harrowing, and planting trees and hemp. Since the beginning of spring, the enthusiasm for production shown by farmers has been filled with a new atmosphere of active production everywhere. In the third special district of Jinnan, all land was harrowed before the sowing season. Areas along the river are trying to irrigate the land. Pingxiang plans to irrigate 6,200 hectares, and has now completed 85% of it. The second district of Ningnan has irrigated more than 20,000 mu of wheat and more than 6,000 mu of autumn land. According to the experience of irrigating wheat in the district last year, each mu of irrigated wheat field can increase production by 40 to 60 jin. The 20,000 mu of wheat fields that have been irrigated are expected to increase production by more than 900,000 jin. Farmers in the waterlogged areas of Wenxin, Gaoyang, Renqiu, Jinghai, Jin, Ba, and Xian counties in Jizhong are now rushing to plant spring wheat and barley. Statistics from 76 waterlogged villages in Xianxian and Wenxin counties alone show that 4,087 mu of spring wheat and barley have been sown. During sowing, most of the disaster-stricken villages mobilized full and half labor forces to rush to plant. After the production plan in Pingshan County, Chahar Province, was conveyed to the villages, most of the 16- and 17-year-old women in the first district participated in driving cattle carts to transport fertilizer, and the 20-year-old young women pushing manure with soil carts were no less than strong men. This year, the orchards have applied 100 small soil carts of fertilizer (pen manure) per mu, which is more than in previous years on average, and the manure is more finely crushed than in previous years. In Qian'an County, Jidong, 125,000 mu of manure has been sent out of 178,900 mu of cultivated land. Some areas have also used a large amount of black soil to make up for the lack of fertilizer and improve the quality of sandy soil.

　　Responding to the Government's Call to Plant Hemp and Trees in Large Quantities
　　In terms of planting trees and hemp, the people in various places actively responded to the government's call because they realized that doing so would be beneficial to them. Therefore, a nationwide upsurge of planting trees and hemp is underway. According to statistics from 14 villages in Guantao, Jinnan, more than 28,000 hemp seeds were planted, with an average of 67 seeds planted per person, which can harvest about 10 jin, and it is expected that a large amount can be sold in addition to self-sufficiency. According to statistics from eight districts in Xushui County, Chahar Province, a total of 48,390 trees were planted. From January to early March, Linzhang 6th District in Jinnan planted 32,577 trees. Under the influence of the active planting by Wang Dechao, the director of the Farmers' Association, and Pang Wensheng, the militia captain, in Xianwang Village, the entire village planted 2,400 trees. Xinle County in Jizhong has a total of 190,000 mu of sandy land. In order to create forests and prevent sand, many villages along the banks of the Shahe River have also mobilized to strive to plant 950,000 trees this year. The four markets of Yilunbao and Dongdawu in Renqiu County also show the farmers' enthusiasm for planting trees this year. Farmers snapped up all the tree seedlings sold in the market, and some even traveled dozens of miles to buy them in a hurry to plant. At present, the tree planting campaign is still being widely carried out in various places.

　　However, after inspecting the work in February and March in line with the specific requirements for spring plowing preparations, the following points still need to be improved: First, it is good that various places have attached considerable importance to the promotion of special crops, but this has led to two deviations: One is that the entire production task has been divided. For example, some areas only focused on planting cotton and peanuts in the deployment and mobilization work, but neglected the promotion of increased production of other crops throughout the year. Therefore, some district and village cadres only paid attention to leading the planting of special crops, and showed a neglect of the development of comprehensive production. This has also caused some farmers to misunderstand the planting of special crops, thinking, what if we plant too much cotton and have nothing to eat or burn? The second is that without taking into account the different conditions and soil quality of various places, the deployment is generally downwards. For example, in the eighth district of Ding County in Jizhong and the sixth and ninth special districts of the Jiluyu district, situations occurred where the number of flower plantings was emphasized in grain-producing areas that were not suitable for planting flowers. If these two deviations are not resolved, they will affect the entire year's production. Second, it is necessary to strengthen the organizational leadership at the district and village levels. Due to frequent cadre transfers during this period, the work has become somewhat disconnected. Therefore, the work in many areas still cannot be carried out in depth. Some areas have not undergone mass mobilization work, and have only made general calls. According to the situation in 91 villages in five districts of Hejian, Jizhong, 19 villages are still inactive. In the second district of Qingyuan, only one village has been mobilized out of 19 villages, and 12 villages have only held a few meetings, and 6 villages have only broadcasted it once and then ended it. According to this situation, the Jizhong Administrative Office instructed various places that it is a good way to conduct short-term training for district and village cadres by grasping specific work content according to different seasonal requirements in the development of production, and various places can also adopt it. Third, specifically solve some of the difficulties in planting special crops, such as seeds, technology, and firewood. Jizhong has solved the problem of coal for the masses. The North China Government has decided on a method of collection in order to dispel the masses' concerns about planting too much cotton and peanuts. These are extremely important measures, but how to truly implement this year's production in a planned and led manner requires a lot of specific organizational work, which is hoped to attract the attention of leaders in various places.

　　华北二三月份农情
    农业增产运动展开
　  部份地区发生偏向应迅速纠正
    【本报讯】二、三月份的华北农村生产，是以动员全年生产并做好一切下种的准备工作为中心开展起来的。根据华北政府一月份的农林会议所决定的全区生产任务——要求今年较去年增产食粮七百五十万石，增产棉花一亿三千万斤，产油料作物九亿三千万斤——各地均先后于二月中下旬召开了各种的生产动员会议（包括劳动能手与干部）截至二月底左右，这些布置均已先后到村。在具体进行中，各级党政领导机关，主要解决了以下问题：
    进行贷款贷种推广特种作物
    第一、是依据华北政府所发布的贷款计划，并依据推广特种作物的要求，各地具体的进行了发放贷款、贷种的工作。冀东行署已贷放棉籽三十九万七千斤，花生种六十三万六千斤，春麦种一百零九万一千斤，白薯种六万斤。察哈尔省政府于二月二十八日起，发放各种农业贷款人民币四千二百五十万元，晋中贸易公司从外区购买三十七万斤种籽，各地且大力组织群众借贷款解决各种生产问题，如冀中第二水利推进社，扶植农民订购了大水车一百一十辆，小水车一百零二辆。太岳区济源县拨粮千石帮助农民治河开渠，已使五千亩水地变成良田。第二、是以大力解决农民牲畜困难。目前各地牲口数目正日趋上升，如太行黎城、沙河、赞皇、和顺、左权、林县、武安、武乡、潞城等十九个县在二月份的统计，在一千二百五十九个村中，共增加牲口达二万四千二百零四头，平均每村约增加十八头。太岳全区已从牧畜区购回牲口三千余头，晋中榆次国营同太商店及晋榆公营商店等机关也替农民购买牲口一百四十余头。
    扶助农民组织起来解决牲畜肥料困难
    察省赤城县的农民近来在政府的协助下，也大批集股购买，如南大庄十五户就买牛十二头。在繁殖牲口上各地也已取得成绩，如冀南广宗县有牛九千零一头，骡驴一百三十五匹，马十二匹，其中母畜共二千六百五十头，种牛十一头，现仅牛已交配三百五十六头，确已怀牛者二百零八头。第三、对优良品种、农药、施肥等方面，各地已均重视，如冀中已召开了农场会议，研究与制订了全年的推广计划，该区十一专区并建立了优良品种推广网。冀鲁豫行署划定了六个美棉培植区，约三万三千余亩，拟播种二Ｂ号斯字棉十万斤，现各地正有重点地领导群众试行播种。其次在肥料上除发动农民大量积肥外，不少地区正具体组织与扶助油房、粉房的恢复与扩大，并通过推进社及生产合作社采购油饼、肥田粉、黑矾等出卖或贷给农民使用。有的地区（如太行榆社等地）更注意了解决烈军属缺肥问题，强调提出为把优军工作做好，首先要做到使军属不缺肥料，达到麦秋时和群众一样的收获。
    事前充分准备扶助灾民春耕
    第四、注意了救灾工作。察省、晋中、冀中、冀南等灾区，今年缺粮、缺种…是一个很严重的问题，可是各区事前准备较充分，如冀南行署为扶助灾区农民春耕和预防春荒，已向遭灾的三、四专区发放贷粮一百七十五万斤，人民币一千五百万元。察哈尔省为解救部份地区之严重春荒，顷拨粮万石予灾情较重之冀察和建屏两个分区的灾民。冀中水灾区献县、高阳、文新三县的推进社，合计贷下麦种约三万七千余斤后，使农民的缺种困难方得到完满解决。
    从农时上讲，这一段主要是为下种做准备，地里活主要是送粪、种春麦、浇地、耙地及植树种大麻等生产，自入春以来农民所表现的生产热忱，是到处都洋溢着积极生产的新气象，冀南三专区土地未到下种期即全部耙完，沿河地区都在设法浇地，平乡预计浇地六千二百顷，现已完成百分之八十五，宁南二区已浇麦两万余亩，秋地六千余亩，根据去年该区浇麦经验，浇过的麦田，每亩可增产四十斤至六十斤，已浇之两万余亩麦田，计可增产九十余万斤。冀中文新、高阳、任邱、静海、晋、霸、献等县水灾区农民，现正赶种春麦、大麦，仅献县、文新两县七十六个水灾村的统计，即已播种春麦、大麦四千零八十七亩，在播种中，大部灾村整劳动力和半劳动力都动员起来，突击赶种。察省平山县生产计划传达到村后，一区十六、七岁的妇女，大部参加了赶牛车送肥，二十岁左右的青妇，用土车推粪已经不弱于壮年男子，今年园子地达到每亩施肥（圈粪）一百小土车，平均比往年多，且粪比往年捣的还碎。冀东迁安全县十七万八千九百余亩耕地中，已送出十二万五千余亩地的粪，有些地区为了补救肥料的不足及改良沙地土质，还大量使用了黑土。
    响应政府号召大量种麻植树
    在植树与种大麻上，各地人民均积极响应政府号召，因为他们已认识到这样做对他们是有利的。所以到处开展着栽树和种大麻的热潮。据冀南馆陶十四个村统计，种大麻子达二万八千余棵，每人平均种六十七棵可收获十斤左右，预计除自给外，尚可大量售出。察省徐水县据八个区统计，在植树方面，共栽种四万八千三百九十余棵，冀南临漳六区自一月至三月初共植三万二千五百七十七棵，该县显王村在农会主任王得朝和民兵队长庞文生两家积极种植的影响下，全村共栽二千四百棵，冀中新乐全县计沙地十九万亩，为造林防沙，在沙河沿岸的许多村庄，也都动员起来，今年争取栽树九十五万棵。任邱县义论堡、东大坞等四个集市上，也可看出今年农民对栽树的积极，农民对市上所出售的树秧，全抢购一空，且有的为急于栽种，不惜远走数十里去购买，目前各地植树运动，仍在广泛的开展着。
    但从春耕准备工作的具体要求来检查二、三月份工作，还有以下几点是需要改进的：第一、各地相当的重视了对特种作物的推广是好的，但由此却发生了两个偏向：一是把全部生产任务割裂了，如有的地区在布置动员工作上，只着重了种植棉花和花生，对推动全年其他生产作物的增产方面却忽略了，故使一些区村干部只重视种特种作物的领导，对全面生产的开展则表现着忽视态度。这样也就造成了一些农民对种植特种作物的误解，以为种得棉多了，没吃的了，没烧的了怎么办？一是不照顾各地不同情况与土质，一般化的向下布置，如冀中定县八区及冀鲁豫区的六、九专区都发生在产粮区、不适宜种花的地区强调分配种花数字的情形。这两个偏向不解决，将影响全年的生产。第二、必须加强对区村级的组织领导，由于这一段干部调动频繁，工作有些脱节，因此许多地区工作仍不能深入展开，还有些地区未经过群众性的动员工作，只做了一般号召、据冀中河间五个区九十一个村的情况，尚有十九个村毫无动静，清苑二区十九个村中只有一个村已动起来，其中十二个村只开了几个会，六个村也只广播了一下即完事大吉。冀中行署据此情况指示各地，在开展生产上，根据不同的季节要求抓住具体的工作内容进行短期训练区村干部的办法是很好的，各地亦可采用。第三、具体解决一些种植特种作物的困难，如种籽、技术、烧柴等，冀中已给群众解决了一部份煤的问题，华北政府为了解除群众怕多种棉花和花生的顾虑已决定了征收时的办法，这些都是极为重要的措施，但如何使今年生产真正有计划有领导的贯彻下去，即还要做许多具体的组织工作，望能引起各地领导上的注意。
