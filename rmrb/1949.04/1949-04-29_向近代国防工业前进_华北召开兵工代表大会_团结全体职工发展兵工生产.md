　　Advancing Towards Modern National Defense Industry
  　North China Convenes Ordnance Industry Representative Conference
    Unite All Employees to Develop Ordnance Production
    [Ping City News] The first employee representative conference of the North China Ordnance Bureau opened on April 10th and victoriously concluded on April 23rd. 123 representatives attended the conference. This is the first time in over a dozen years, since the War of Resistance, that the North China Ordnance Industry, which was divided by the enemy into northern and southern regions separated by thousands of miles of mountains, has been able to unite under one organizational leadership, gather together, exchange experiences, jointly discuss major issues such as production to support the front, and solve pressing problems. Therefore, the representatives were all extremely excited. The conference received congratulatory banners from Commander-in-Chief Zhu De and the General Rear Services Department of the Central Military Commission, the North China People's Government, and the All-China Federation of Trade Unions. Commander-in-Chief Zhu De's congratulatory banner read: "Advance towards a modern national defense industry," indicating the general direction for future efforts. The conference summarized and exchanged experiences from the labor union work in the former Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu and Jin-Cha-Ji regions, adopted a collective contract, formulated unified organizational regulations, drafted the North China Ordnance Wartime Provisional Labor Insurance Measures, and discussed and adopted resolutions on future work guidelines and tasks. In addition to correctly assessing the achievements of the ordnance industry in the past two regions in developing production, supporting the war, and implementing the enterprise-based policy, the resolution pointed out the main shortcomings in the work of the two labor unions: the effectiveness of the labor union organization in the entire production process and in promoting democratic management of factories was not sufficient, and there was still a certain degree of formalism and bureaucracy that was not thorough and did not understand the situation at the grassroots level. The resolution emphatically and clearly put forward that the general policy and task today is: all employees should unite closely, vigorously develop ordnance production, implement the enterprise-based policy, advance towards a modern national defense industry, support the southward army, and rapidly liberate all of China. Under this general policy and task, the specific goals of the increasing production and meritorious service campaign were clearly defined - to improve quality, reduce costs, complete production tasks, guarantee supplies to the front, and strive to improve production efficiency and work quality by using revolutionary competition methods.
    Regarding employee education, it was stipulated that it should revolve around the center of developing production and implementing the enterprise-based policy, improving the class consciousness of employees, fully developing the sense of being masters of the country, and improving cultural and professional skills. The specific content of after-work education and the direction of development towards standardization were clearly defined. Regarding labor insurance and employee welfare undertakings, it was specifically stipulated to rapidly implement various insurance undertakings under the conditions of being justified, necessary, and permissible. Such as running supply cooperatives, organizing family production, and establishing welfare undertakings such as nurseries and children's schools. Finally, the conference elected the first executive committee and established its own leading body. Representatives to the North China Workers' Congress were also elected.

　　向近代国防工业前进
  　华北召开兵工代表大会
    团结全体职工发展兵工生产
    【平市讯】华北兵工局首届职工代表大会于四月十日开幕，二十三日胜利闭幕。出席大会的代表有一百二十三人。自抗战至今十几年来，被敌分割在南北两区千余里山沟中的华北兵工，能够统一在一个组织领导之下，团聚一堂，交流经验，共同商讨生产支前等重大事项，解决切身问题，这是第一次。因此到会代表，无不兴奋异常。会中收到朱总司令与中央军委后方勤务部，华北人民政府，全国总工会等首脑机关的贺幛。朱总司令的贺旗上写着：“向近代国防工业前进”，指示了今后努力的总方向。大会总结和交流了原晋冀鲁豫、晋察冀两区工运工作的经验，通过了集体合同，制订了统一的组织章程，拟订了华北兵工战时暂行劳动保险办法，讨论和通过了今后工作方针和任务的决议。决议中除对过去两区兵工在发展生产，支援战争，实行企业化方针方面的成绩做了正确的估计外，并指出两工会工作中存在的主要缺点：工会组织在整个生产过程中所发挥的效能及促进工厂管理民主化方面做的不够，还存在某种程度的不深入，不了解下情的形式主义、官僚主义的作风。决议着重而明确地提出了今天的总的方针任务是：全体职工亲密团结，大力发展兵工生产，贯彻企业化方针，向近代化国防工业前进，支援南下大军，迅速解放全中国。在这一总方针任务之下，又明确规定了增产立功运动的具体目标——提高质量，减低成本，完成生产任务，保证前方供给，用革命竞赛的办法，把生产效率和工作质量努力提高一步。
    关于职工教育规定围绕发展生产，贯彻企业化方针这一中心，提高职工阶级觉悟，充分发扬国家主人翁的感觉，提高文化业务水平。明确规定了业余教育的具体内容及向正规化发展的方向。关于劳动保险与职工福利事业，则是在正当的、必需的、条件许可的诸条件下，具体规定了迅速举办各项保险事业。如举办供应社，组织家属生产，创办保育院、子弟学校等福利事业。最后大会选举了第一届执行委员，建成了自己的领导机关。并选举了出席华北工代大会的代表。
