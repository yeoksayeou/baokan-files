[Zhangjiakou News] Liu Yujiang, a soldier of the Zhangjiakou Security Brigade, was expelled from the police force and sent to the People's Court for legal processing due to extortion. Liu Yujiang was originally a soldier in the puppet Zhangjiakou Police Corps. After liberation, he was incorporated into our Security Brigade and assigned to the Third Branch of the Public Security Bureau. While guarding and escorting opium offender Zhang Peiyu, he went to Zhang's home on several occasions, extorting RMB 1,350, 11 packs of cigarettes, one bolt of white cloth, and numerous items such as cotton and foreign socks. After our public security organs discovered this egregious Kuomintang-style behavior, they immediately ordered Liu Yujiang to hand over the extorted money and goods to the original owner and decided to: In addition to expelling Liu Yujiang from the police force, he will also be sent to the People's Court for legal punishment.
