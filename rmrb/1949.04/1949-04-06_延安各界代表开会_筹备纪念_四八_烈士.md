　　Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 5th. Representatives from all circles in Yan'an's Party, government, military, and civilian sectors met at the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Government on the 31st of last month to discuss preparatory work for commemorating the third anniversary of the martyrdom of the "April 8th" Martyrs. The meeting decided to hold a memorial service at the "April 8th" Martyrs Cemetery on April 8th, along with a tomb-sweeping ceremony. The purpose is to publicize the deeds of the "April 8th" Martyrs who sacrificed their lives for peace and democracy, and to expose the current false peace conspiracy of the Nanjing Kuomintang reactionary government. Note: Three years ago, Chinese Communist Party leaders Wang Ruofei, Qin Bangxian, Ye Ting, Deng Fa, and educator Huang Qisheng, among others, were working for the cause of national peace and democracy when they tragically died in a plane crash on Black Tea Mountain in Xing County, northwestern Shanxi Province, on April 8th.

　　延安各界代表开会
  　筹备纪念“四八”烈士
    【新华社延安五日电】延安党政军民各界代表上月三十一日在陕甘宁边区政府开会，讨论纪念“四八”烈士殉难三周年的筹备工作。会上决定四月八日在“四八”烈士陵园召开纪念大会，举行扫墓仪式。宣传“四八”烈士为和平民主而殉难的事迹，揭露目前南京国民党反动政府的假和平阴谋。按：三年前中国共产党领袖王若飞、秦邦宪、叶挺、邓发和教育家黄齐生等，为全国和平民主事业奔走，四月八日在山西西北部兴县黑茶山，因飞机失事不幸遇难。
