　　The Lüda region, including Dalian City, Lüshun City, Dalian County, Jin County, Changshan Islands, Sanshan Island, and many adjacent small islands, also known as Kwantung, is located at the southern tip of the Liaodong Peninsula. It starts from Shiheyi in the north, extends deep into the Bohai Sea in the south, and faces the Shandong Peninsula, forming a peninsula surrounded by sea on three sides. It covers an area of 3,399 square kilometers and currently has a population of over 910,000. The Chinese Changchun Railway runs through the entire region, connecting it to major cities in Northeast China. Maritime transportation, centered on Dalian, connects to major domestic ports. Dalian City, located at the southern end of Dalian Bay, formerly known as Qingniwa, is an ice-free port capable of accommodating large ships. In the past, most of Northeast China's products were exported through here, and its foreign trade was second only to Shanghai. Lüshun is located southwest of Dalian, at the juncture of the Bohai and Yellow Seas. Surrounded by high mountains, it is strategically important and serves as an excellent naval port. The region's specialties include salt, fish, peanuts, apples, etc., all of which are famous in Northeast China. There are also mineral resources such as stone quarries, silica, and dolomite.

　　The Lüda region was long invaded by Japanese imperialism. During the Sino-Japanese War of 1894, Dalian was once occupied by the Japanese. Later, in 1898, Dalian and Lüshun were "leased" to the Russian Empire for 25 years. In 1905, due to the defeat of Tsarist Russia in the Russo-Japanese War, Lüda was "leased" to Japan again. After the expiration of the lease, Japan occupied it without returning it. It was not until August 15, 1945, that the people of Lüda, with the help of the Soviet army, were freed from the enslavement of Japanese invaders and liberated. According to the "Sino-Soviet Treaty of Friendship and Alliance" and the "Agreement between China and the Soviet Union on Lüshunkou," signed simultaneously, in order to strengthen the common security of China and the Soviet Union and prevent Japan from launching another invasion, it was stipulated that Lüshunkou would be defended by the Soviet Union for thirty years, while civil administration would still belong to China, making it a jointly used naval base for both countries, with the Soviet Union allowed to station naval, land, and air forces in the area. According to the "Agreement between China and the Soviet Union on Dalian," in order to ensure the Soviet Union's interests in Dalian for the import and export of its goods, Dalian was designated as a free port, and it was stipulated that during the war against Japan (now that the peace treaty with Japan has not been signed, this state of war has not ended), Dalian would also be included within the scope of the naval base regulations stipulated in the Lüshun Agreement and subject to the military jurisdiction of that area. These two agreements placed the Lüda region in an important position in the common cause of China and the Soviet Union to defend peace and democracy in the Far East against and prevent imperialist aggression.

　　After the liberation of Lüda, the Chinese Communist Party organizations in Lüda, with the support of the people, the friendly assistance of the Soviet army, and the correct leadership of the Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, mobilized and organized the broad masses of workers and other working people, and led the construction of New Democracy, achieving great success in these endeavors. The industry left behind by Japanese imperialism in Lüda was completely paralyzed, but through the arduous efforts of the people of Lüda, by 1947, 64 of the larger state-owned factories had resumed operations, and this number increased to 75 in 1948. The industrial investment in 1947 was 1.2 billion Kwantung currency, while the industrial investment in 1948 reached 5 billion yuan (excluding investments from Sino-Soviet joint ventures). The number of industrial workers in the entire region was 23,095 in 1947, and by the end of June 1948, it had increased to 57,411, and currently it has reached 59,012 (including handicraftsmen, totaling 98,057). The total value of production in 1947 was 20.7 billion yuan, and the total value of production in 1948 increased to 40 billion yuan. In agriculture, as a result of leading farmers in dividing public land, reclaiming wasteland, and intensive cultivation, the total output in 1945 was 120,000 tons, which increased to 125,000 tons in 1946, 140,000 tons in 1947, and surged to 208,000 tons in 1948. Cultural and educational construction has also developed rapidly in the past three and a half years. After the liberation of Lüda, the four newly established specialized schools of industry, medicine, literature and art, and electrical engineering had a total of 784 students in 1947, and the number of students increased to 1,158 in 1948. Dalian University was founded at the beginning of this year, with two colleges of engineering and medicine, as well as a Russian language training course, and currently has 1,250 students. In 1947, there were six middle schools with a total of 1,708 students. Last year, two more middle schools were added, and the number of students has increased to 4,020. In 1947, there were 61,708 students in 229 primary schools. In 1948, the number of primary schools increased to 289, and the number of students was 80,859. Regular publications include the People's Daily, the Truth Newspaper, the Workers' Newspaper, the Farmers' Newspaper, the Literature and Art Newspaper, and magazines such as "Friendship" and "Democratic Youth." Mass cultural and entertainment venues, in addition to the Cultural Palace, Cultural Center, and Cultural Entertainment Department in Dalian City, are spread throughout the cities, counties, districts, and factories. Mass organizations such as trade unions, farmers' associations, youth groups, women's groups, and the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association have been widely established in factories, schools, rural areas, and government agencies. According to current statistics, the number of organized masses in the entire region has reached over 350,000, an increase of more than 90,000 from last year. The Preparatory Committee of the New Democratic Youth League of Lüda has been established and is actively working to establish the Youth League.

　　Over the past three years, the material life of the broad working people of Lüda has greatly improved. The eight-hour working day has been implemented in most factories. The vast majority of workers in the entire region are able to receive subsidies for medical treatment, weddings and funerals, and benefits such as nurseries and free education. In rural areas, due to the implementation of the policy of developing agricultural production and the implementation of rent reduction policies and progressive agricultural taxes that are beneficial to working farmers, the lives of farmers have generally improved. After participating in production, the social status of women has also greatly increased. In Dalian and Lüshun, 24,355 women are engaged in the production of various light and heavy industries, and they enjoy the same treatment as male workers. A large number of working women have gained independent economic status as a result of participating in production. Over the past three years, the political consciousness of the people of Lüda has greatly increased. They are not only working hard to build a new Lüda of New Democracy, but also actively assisting the Soviet army in consolidating the Lüshun naval base because they recognize the great significance of the Soviet army's garrisoning in defending peace and democracy in the Far East.

　　In April of this year, the Lüda District Committee of the CPC launched a conference of party activists in the Lüda region, discussed the work of the Lüda Party in the past three years, and determined that further development of production and construction is the basic task of Lüda in the future. With the demands and support of the working class and working people in the entire region, the CPC in Lüda has begun to be made public among the masses from this conference of activists.

　　旅大概况
    旅大地区，包括大连市、旅顺市、大连县、金县、长山列岛、三山岛及其临近许多小岛，或称关东，位于辽东半岛南端。北起石河驿，南部深入渤海，与山东半岛相望，是一个三面临海的半岛。面积三千三百九十九平方公里，现有人口九十一万余人。陆路交通有中国长春铁路贯穿全区，沿该路向北可通东北各大城市。海上交通以大连为中心，可通国内各大港口。大连市位于大连湾南端，旧名青泥洼，为一能容巨船的不冻港。过去东北物产多由此出口，对外贸易之盛仅次于上海。旅顺在大连西南，当渤海和黄海的要冲，高山四围，形势险要，是一个优良的军港。区内特产有盐、鱼、落花生、苹果等，均驰名东北。此外尚有石矿属矿、硅石、白云石等矿产。
    旅大地区曾经长期被日本帝国主义所侵略。在一八九四年“甲午”中日之战中，大连一度被日本人所占。以后，在一八九八年，大连和旅顺同被俄罗斯帝国所“租借”，为期二十五年。一九零五年，因为帝俄在日俄战争中失败，旅大又被转“租”于日本，期满后日本却霸占不还。直到一九四五年八月十五日，旅大人民才在苏联出兵帮助下，摆脱了日本侵略者的奴役，得到了解放。按照和“中苏友好同盟条约”同时签订的“中苏关于旅顺口之协定”，为加强中苏两国的共同安全、防止日本再事侵略起见，规定旅顺口在三十年内为由苏联负责防卫，而民事行政仍属于中国的中苏两国共同使用的海军根据地，苏联得在该区驻扎海陆空军。按照“中苏关于大连之协定”，为保证苏联对大连为其货物进出口之利益获得保障起见，规定大连为一自由港，并规定在对日作战期间（现在对日和约尚未签订，这种作战状态尚未结束），大连也包括在旅顺协定所定之海军根据地章程效用范围之内，受该区域之军事管辖。这两个协定，使旅大地区在中苏两国保卫远东和平民主以反对和防止帝国主义侵略的共同事业中，占有重要的地位。
    旅大解放以后，中国共产党在旅大的组织，在人民的拥护下，在苏军的友好帮助和中共中央东北局的正确领导下，发动和组织了广大的工人群众与其他劳动人民，领导进行了新民主主义的建设工作，并在这些工作中获得了巨大的成绩。日本帝国主义在旅大所遗留下的工业，原是完全处于瘫痪状态的，但经过旅大人民的艰苦努力，到一九四七年，规模较大的公营工厂开工的已达六十四所，一九四八年则增至七十五所。一九四七年工业投资额为十二亿关东币，而一九四八年的工业投资即达五十亿元（中苏合营企业的投资未计在内）。全区产业职工一九四七年是两万三千零九十五人，一九四八年六月底已增至五万七千四百十一人，目前则达五万九千零十二人（加上手工业工人，共计九万八千零五十七人）。一九四七年的生产总值为二百零七亿元，一九四八年生产总值增至四百亿元。在农业方面，由于领导农民进行分公地、开荒、深耕细作等的结果，一九四五年全年产量是十二万吨，一九四六年增至十二万五千吨，一九四七年增至十四万吨，一一九四八年激增至二十万零八千吨。文化教育的建设三年半来也有迅速的发展。旅大解放以后，新设的工业、医药、文艺、电气等四个专科学校，在一九四七年共有七百八十四名学生，一九四八年学生人数即增至一千一百五十八名。今年年初又创办了大连大学，内设有工、医两院及俄语专修科，现有学生一千二百五十名；中等学校在一九四七年是六所，共有学生一千七百零八名，去年增设两所中学，学生人数已增至四千零二十名。一九四七年，在二百二十九所小学中有学生六万一千七百零八名，一九四八年小学增至二百八十九所，学生人数则为八万零八百五十九名。定期出版物有人民日报、实话报、职工报、农民报、文艺报等报纸和“友谊”“民主青年”等杂志。群众性的文化娱乐场所，除大连市的文化宫、文化馆、文化娱乐部等，遍布各市、县、区及各工厂。工会、农会、青年团体、妇女团体和中苏友好协会等群众团体，已普遍地在工厂、学校、农村、机关中建立。据目前统计：全区有组织的群众已达三十五万人以上，较去年增加九万余人。旅大的新民主主义青年团筹委会已经成立，正在积极进行建立青年团的工作。
    三年多来旅大广大劳动人民的物质生活，已大为改善。在大部工厂中实行了八小时工作制。全区绝大多数工人都能够受到疗病、婚丧的补助和托儿所、免费学习等项优待。在农村中，由于贯彻了发展农业生产的方针，并实行了有利于劳动农民的减租政策和农业累进税，农民生活已普遍上升。妇女在参加生产后，社会地位亦大大升高。大连旅顺两地有二万四千三百五十五名妇女从事各种轻重工业的生产，她们享受了与男工一样的待遇。大量劳动妇女已因参加了生产而取得了独立的经济地位。三年多来，旅大人民政治觉悟大大地提高了。他们不但努力于建设新民主主义的新旅大，并且因为认识到苏联驻军对保卫远东和平民主的重大意义，而积极地协助苏军巩固旅顺海军根据地。
    今年四月份，中共旅大区党委展开了旅大地区党的活动分子大会，讨论了旅大党三年来的工作，确定了进一步发展生产建设为旅大今后的基本任务。在全区工人阶级和劳动人民的要求和拥护下，旅大的中共党已经从这次活动分子大会开始在人民群众中公开。
