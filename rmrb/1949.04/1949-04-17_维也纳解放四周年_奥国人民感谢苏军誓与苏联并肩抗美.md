　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 15th: Vienna dispatch: On April 13th, all buildings in the Austrian capital were flying the national flag to commemorate the fourth anniversary of the Soviet army's liberation of Vienna from Hitler's troops. Representatives of the Austrian government and the Vienna City Council laid wreaths at the monument to the Soviet officers and soldiers who died in the battle to liberate Vienna in Stalin Square. The Austrian Association for Cultural and Economic Relations with the Soviet Union held a memorial meeting. Fiala, the second vice-chairman of the Presidium of the Austrian Trade Union Federation, delivered a speech at the meeting, stating: Today, we not only express our deep gratitude to the Soviet people and their great leader Marshal Stalin, but also swear that we will stand shoulder to shoulder with the Soviet people in the struggle for peace. Fiala continued: American reactionaries, with the help of certain Austrian politicians, are attempting to turn Austria into a base for aggression against the Soviet Union and a front line for a new war. However, even if the American militarist group launches a war, the Austrian working people will not stand with the warmongers, imperialists, brutal beasts, and their accomplices. The Austrian people will stand on the side of the camp of peace, democracy, and socialism to fight.

　　维也纳解放四周年
  　奥国人民感谢苏军誓与苏联并肩抗美
    【新华社北平十五日电】维也纳讯：四月十三日，奥京所有建筑物，都高悬国旗，纪念苏军自希特勒军队下解放维也纳的四周年。奥政府及维也纳市议会的代表，在斯大林广场上，向在解放维也纳之战中阵亡的苏军官兵纪念碑献花圈。奥国对苏文化经济关系协会举行纪念会，奥地利工会联合会主席团第二副主席斐亚拉在会上发表演说称：今天，我们不仅要对苏联人民及其伟大领袖斯大林元帅表示深切的感谢，而且，我们宣誓我们将与苏联人民肩并肩地参加和平事业的斗争。斐亚拉继称：美国反动派借奥地利某些政客之助，正企图变奥地利为侵略苏联的据点，变奥地利为新战争的前线。但是，即使美国军国主义集团发动了战争，奥地利劳动人民也是不与战争贩子，帝国主义分子，残暴的野兽及其帮凶站在一边的。奥地利人民将站在和平、民主与社会主义阵营方面作战。
