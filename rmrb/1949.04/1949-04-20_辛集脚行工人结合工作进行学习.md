    [Jizhong News] Under the leadership of the Xinji City Party Committee and the Trade Union, the porter workers of Xinji City have established a study system over the past year. Their learning method is to combine it with practical work, learning whatever they do. For example, when unloading coal, loading cars, or carrying something, they learn the corresponding characters. The learning method is to gather every morning, write the characters to be learned that day on the blackboard, and teach everyone to recognize them once. After dispersing, each group takes a piece of paper with the same characters written on it to the workplace and learns whenever they have time. Political study is also tightly grasped. Every night, the group leaders go to the trade union to hold a preliminary meeting, and then begin to study newspapers or textbooks for one hour. The next day, they take time in the group to tell everyone the news of victory and government decrees. The workers have a high enthusiasm for learning. Group leader Wu Guixu, who used to be illiterate, has learned to do accounting in two months. An Miaolai had his foot broken by a train and is recuperating in the hospital, but he still asks to study. Trade union cadre Liu Changshuan grabs newspapers and books to study whenever he has a little free time.

　　辛集脚行工人　结合工作进行学习
    【冀中讯】辛集市脚行工人，一年来在市党委与工会的领导下，建立了学习制度。他们的学习方法是与实际工作结合，作什么，学什么。如卸炭、装车或搬运什么东西，即学什么字。学习方式每天早晨集合，上班时把当天要学的字写在黑板上，教大家认一遍。散后各组将写着同样字的纸条带到工作地方，有空就学。时事学习抓得也很紧，每天晚上，各组长到工会开碰头会后，即开始学习一小时的报纸或课本，第二天在组里抽空把胜利消息和政府法令讲给大家听。工人学习情绪很高，组长吴桂须，过去一个字不识，两个月已学会计工帐了。安庙来被火车轧断了脚，在医院里休养着还要求学习；工会干部柳长栓有一点空就抓起报纸和书学习起来。
