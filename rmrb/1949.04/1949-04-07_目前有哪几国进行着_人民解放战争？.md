　　Which Countries are Currently Engaged in
  　People's Liberation Wars?
    Editor:

    Besides our country, which other countries in the world are currently engaged in people's liberation wars?
　　Fang Hui

    Mr. Fang Hui:

    Besides our country, which is currently engaged in a people's liberation war, the people of the Philippines, Indonesia, Vietnam, Burma, Malaya, India, Greece, and Spain are also, under the leadership of their respective Communist Parties, waging people's liberation wars to fight for freedom, peace, and independence against their reactionary rulers, who are manipulated by American and British imperialism.
    The people's armed forces of these countries are now growing stronger day by day. For example, the number of guerrillas (People's Anti-Japanese Army) in the Philippines has increased to 200,000. The provinces of Pampanga, Nueva Ecija, Bulacan, Tarlac, and Laguna, which belong to the most affluent island of Luzon in the Philippines, are controlled by the people. Their forces have also extended to Mindanao Island and Negros Island, establishing guerrilla zones. Land reform is also being implemented in the guerrilla zones. The people's liberation war in Indonesia has entered a new stage. After the Hatta reactionary government shamelessly sold out the Republic of Indonesia to Dutch imperialism, the democratic forces of Indonesia have resolved to fight for genuine independence. Currently, the guerrilla war is expanding, and there are 300,000 guerrillas. The Vietnamese People's Liberation Army, under the leadership of Ho Chi Minh, launched a counteroffensive as early as December 1947 and recovered three-quarters of the land occupied by the French army. The Vietnamese People's Government is also drawing up a list of war criminals. The valiant Burmese people's armed forces have caused Tachin Aung San to panic due to their growing strength. The Burmese people's armed forces have controlled most of the densely populated central and southern Burma regions between Yangon and Mandalay, establishing democratic base areas. The "Malayan People's Anti-British Army" under the leadership of the Communist Party of Malaya is now engaged in a new anti-British struggle. In the first stage, British imperialism has suffered a crushing defeat. Farmers in Hyderabad, the largest princely state in India, and Madras Province, under the leadership of the Communist Party of India, continue to persist in guerrilla warfare. In Haibang, a liberated area with 5 million people and more than 2,000 villages has been established. The Greek People's Liberation Army (Democratic Army) has recovered three-quarters of the territory of Greece, where there is already a people's state and government. Now the Greek People's Liberation Army is also fighting for the liberation of the whole of Greece. The flames of guerrilla warfare against the fascist Franco in Spain are spreading throughout Spain.

　　目前有哪几国进行着
  　人民解放战争？
    编辑先生：
    世界上除我国外，尚有那些国家正在进行人民解放战争？
　　方晖
    方晖先生：
    世界上除我国正在进行人民解放战争之外，还有菲律宾、印度尼西亚、越南、缅甸、马来亚、印度、希腊及西班牙等国家的人民，也正在各国共产党领导下与其在美英帝国主义操纵下的各该国反动统治者们，进行着争取自由、和平、独立的人民解放战争。
    这些国家人民武装力量现已日渐增强。如菲律宾的游击队（民抗军）员人数已增为二十万，菲律宾最富足的吕宋岛所属班邦加、奴瓦伊西加、布拉坎、塔尔拉克和拉格纳各省均控制在人民的手中，他们的力量并已伸展到民答那峨岛和内格罗（黑人）岛，建立了游击区、在游击区内还实行着土地改革。印尼的人民解放战争已进入新阶段。这次哈达反动政府无耻地把印尼共和国断送给荷兰帝国主义后，印尼的民主力量已决心争取真正独立。目前游击战正在扩大，游击队员已拥有三十万人。在胡志明领导下的越南人民解放军，早于一九四七年十二月开始了反攻，收复法军占去的土地四分之三。越南人民政府也正在制订战犯名单。英勇的缅甸人民武装，由于力量的增涨，已使达钦弩惊慌失措。缅甸人民武装已控制了仰光与曼德勒间人口繁密的中、南缅绝大部分地区，建立了民主根据地。在马来亚共产党领导下的“马来亚人民抗英军”，现正进行新的反英斗争，在第一阶段英帝国主义已遭到了惨败。印度最大土邦海德拉巴土邦及马德拉斯省的农民，在印度共产党领导下，继续坚持游击战争。在海邦建立了拥有五百万人口的两千多乡村的解放区。希腊人民解放军（民主军）已经收复了希腊全境的四分之三的土地，在那里已有了人民的国家与政府。现在希腊人民解放军也在为解放全希腊而奋战。西班牙人民反对法西斯佛朗哥的游击烽火，正蔓延在西班牙全境。
