　　Notice from the North China People's Government on Protecting Railway Collection Materials
    [Our Newspaper's Dispatch] Currently, most of the railways in North China have been taken over by us and have become the people's railways. In order to develop production and construction and support the nationwide liberation war, the North China People's Government has issued a notice to earnestly protect them. It also ordered governments at all levels to educate the masses and mobilize them to work together to protect the railways, strictly prevent sabotage by bandits and special agents, and pay special attention to tunnels, bridges, power lines, and water supply facilities. The notice pointed out: Some railways have not yet been recovered, but they will soon all be under our control. Therefore, they must also be protected and no further damage is allowed. No military, government, or civilian personnel are allowed to damage them again under the pretext of military or work needs (such as moving rails, pulling electric wires, or damaging machinery). Those who deliberately violate this will be dealt with according to the law. The notice continued: In the past, road destruction caused many railway materials to be scattered throughout various regions. Local governments should earnestly continue to deeply mobilize the masses to collect the remaining railway materials (including steel rails, fishplates, screws, spikes, electric wires, etc.) and send them to the stations along the line for use. The collection method can be implemented with reference to the Instruction No. 4 issued by the Jiaotie [Communications and Railway] Department on December 16 of last year; however, Article 4 of that order, which stipulates "giving appropriate bonuses," has led to abuses since its implementation. Therefore, it has been decided that the method of giving rewards or buying at a price will no longer be adopted. As for the expenses required for transporting materials, they will still be paid by the Railway Bureau. Finally, the notice requires local governments to maintain close contact with the railway bureaus and stations along the line to discuss specific methods for collection, transportation, and reception.

　　华北人民政府通令保护铁路收集器材
    【本报讯】目前华北铁路已大多为我掌握，成为人民的铁路，为发展生产建设，支援全国解放战争，华北人民政府顷通令切实加以保护。并令各级政府应对群众进行教育，动员群众一体努力保护铁路，严防匪特破坏，对于山洞、桥梁、电线及给水等各项更须特别注意。通令指出：有些铁路，虽尚未收复，但很快的亦将全部归我掌握，因此亦必须予以保护，不许再事破坏，无论军、政、民，均不得借口军事或工作需要，再行破坏（如搬道轨、拉电线、搞机件等均所不许），如有故违，应依法处理。通令继指出：过去破路，使许多铁路器材散失各地，各地政府应切实继续深入动员群众，将所存之铁路器材（包括钢轨、鱼尾板、螺丝、道钉、电线等）搜集起来送交沿线各站，以便应用。收集办法可参照去年十二月十六日所发交铁字第四号训令执行；但该令第四项有“酌量给予奖励金”之规定，实行以来，流弊滋生，因此决定不许再采用给奖或出价收买办法。至于运输器材所需之费用，则仍由铁路局支付。最后通令要求各地政府应与沿线铁路局站密切连系，研商搜集输送与接收之具体办法。
