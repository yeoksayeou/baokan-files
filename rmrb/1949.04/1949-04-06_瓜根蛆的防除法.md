　　Prevention and Control of Melon Root Maggots

　　When planting melons, the seeds don't sprout for many days after sowing, or they sprout very small and then wither and die. Digging open the melon nest, you see a kind of small white maggot. This is the melon root maggot. The reason why the melons don't sprout or wither is because they are bitten by it. It not only harms pumpkins, gourds, and cucumbers, but also radishes, turnips, beans, and peanuts.

　　The melon root maggot is the larva of a small fly (also known as seed fly). Seed flies are about the same size as houseflies, and reproduce several times a year, overwintering as pupae. When it's time to plant melons and vegetables in the spring, they turn into seed flies and fly out, laying their eggs in the ground where melons and beans are sown. The eggs turn into larvae (melon root maggots) in a few days, and they bite and harm seeds and seedlings.

　　Prevention methods:

　　1. To make the seeds germinate quickly and avoid being harmed, such as cucumbers and cantaloupes, the seeds can be placed in a bowl and soaked in warm water for half a day. Pour out the water, and then cover with a clean, damp towel (keep it moist often) to make them germinate before sowing, which can avoid harm.

　　2. Sowing in seedling beds and then transplanting can also be avoided. Cover with a layer of dry sand after planting.

　　3. This insect is less common in dry places and more common in humid places, so planting should be in dry places.

　　4. Fresh manure has a foul smell, which easily attracts seed flies to lay eggs, causing maggot damage. Therefore, avoid applying fresh manure when planting melons, and it should be applied after it is well rotted.

　　5. When sowing, the seeds can be mixed with zinc phosphide bait to poison and kill the larvae.

### 瓜根蛆的防除法

　　瓜根蛆的防除法
    种瓜的时候，种子播下后许多日子不见出苗，或是出苗很小就又枯死，掘开瓜窝一看有一种小白蛆，这就是瓜根蛆，瓜不出苗与枯死的原因就是被它咬的。它不光吃害南瓜、北瓜、黄瓜，还咬害萝＠、蔓菁、豆类、落花生。
    瓜根蛆是一种小苍蝇（又名种蝇）的幼虫。种蝇和家蝇大小差不多，一年繁殖好几次，是以蛹越冬。到了春天种瓜菜的时候就变成种蝇飞了出来，将卵产在播种瓜豆的地中，卵不多几天即变为幼虫（瓜根蛆），来咬害种子及幼苗。
    防除方法：
    一、为使种子发芽快，避免受害，如黄瓜、甜瓜，可将种子放在碗里，用温水泡半天，将水倒去，然后盖一干净湿手巾（要时常湿），使它生芽后，再行播种，可免危害。
    二、播种秧畦再行移栽也可避免，种后盖一层干沙。
    三、此虫干燥地方较少，潮湿地方较多，故种植应选干燥地方。
    四、新鲜的大粪有臭味，容易招致种蝇前来产卵，酿成蛆害。所以种瓜时要避免施新鲜大粪，应腐熟后再施用。
    五、播种时可将种子拌入信谷毒饵，毒杀幼虫。
