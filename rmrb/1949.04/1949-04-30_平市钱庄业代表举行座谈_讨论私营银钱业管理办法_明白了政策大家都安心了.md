　　Ping City Money Shop Representatives Hold Symposium
　  Discussing Management Measures for Private Silver and Money Businesses
    Understanding the Policies Gives Everyone Peace of Mind
    [Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper] Representatives from the city's money shops, including Qin Zhipu, held a symposium at the Money Shop Association on West River Bank yesterday (the 29th) to discuss the "Management Measures for Private Silver and Money Businesses in the North China Region" recently promulgated by the North China People's Government. Representatives from forty-eight money shops attended. Zeng Ling, Director of the Financial Department of the Head Office of the People's Bank of China, Deputy Director Xiang Weile, and Zhang Yuntian, Manager of the Ping City Branch, also attended. Manager Zhang Yuntian explained at the meeting that the "Management Measures for Private Silver and Money Businesses in the North China Region" had been promulgated for two days; in order to implement this policy, the People's Government sincerely wishes to absorb opinions from all parties and hopes that all representatives will actively speak. More than thirty representatives expressed their opinions at the meeting, all saying that the promulgation of these measures has stabilized the mood of both the silver and money industries. Before the promulgation of these measures, they were unsure how the People's Government would handle the silver and money industries, and some even thought that this industry would not be allowed to exist. After the measures were announced, people felt relieved, knowing that as long as the silver and money businesses operate deposits, loans, remittances, and other legitimate businesses properly, and contribute to the development of industry and commerce, they will be allowed to exist and develop. They also pointed out that Beiping is different from other commercial ports: the silver and money industry in Beiping was not developed enough to begin with, and it has been further devastated and plundered by the Kuomintang reactionary government's "currency system reform," so it has been declining. They hope that under the supervision of the People's Government, it can operate normally. After everyone discussed the issues related to the management measures, they further suggested that the People's Bank formulate specific measures to prohibit businesses from issuing bad checks in order to maintain the credit of negotiable instruments; recall small denomination banknotes to facilitate the collection and payment of funds; and print and distribute banknote samples to the silver and money industry to distinguish genuine from counterfeit. Finally, Manager Zhang Yuntian said to the representatives attending the meeting: "You can still tell us your unfinished opinions in writing." He said: "We will also exchange opinions with various banking units in the city in the coming days. After we have collected all aspects of opinions, we will jointly study them again." (Yu)

　　平市钱庄业代表举行座谈
　  讨论私营银钱业管理办法
    明白了政策大家都安心了
    【本报专访】本市钱庄业代表秦芝圃等于昨（二十九）日在西河沿钱庄业公会举行座谈会，讨论华北人民政府最近颁布的“华北区私营银钱业管理办法”。四十八家钱庄业，均有代表出席。中国人民银行总行金融处处长曾凌、副处长项伟略、平市分行经理张云天亦出席参加。张云天经理在会上说明：“华北区私营银钱业管理办法”已公布两天；人民政府为了贯彻执行这一政策，深愿吸收各方意见，希望各代表踊跃发言。会上有三十几个代表发表意见，都说：这个办法一颁布，银钱两业的情绪都安定了。在这个办法未颁布前，他们对人民政府将要如何处理银钱两业，都摸不着底，甚至有人以为将不准许这一行业存在；该办法公布后，人们心里都踏实下来，知道银钱业只要正当经营存放款、汇兑和其他正当业务，有助于工商业的发展，是允许存在和发展的。他们又提出：北平与其他商埠市不同：北平银钱业原不够发达，又遭国民党反动政府“改革币制”的摧残掠夺，已是每况愈下，希望在人民政府督导下能够正常经营下去。大家讨论了有关管理办法的问题后，进一步建议人民银行规定具体办法，禁止商号开发空头支票，以维票据信用；收回小额钞票，以便利款项收解，印发钞票样本，分发银钱业，以资辨别真伪。最后，张云天经理向参加会的代表们说：“大家有未说完的意见还可以用书面告诉我们。”他说：我们日内还要和本市银行业各单位交换意见，等到把各方面的意见搜集齐全后，大家再共同研究一次。（宇）
