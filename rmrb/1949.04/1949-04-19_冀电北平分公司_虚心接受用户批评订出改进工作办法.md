　　Humbly Accepts User Criticism and Formulates Measures to Improve Work
　　[Beiping News] Due to the conscientious efforts of all employees and the assistance of users throughout the city, the Jibei Electric Power Beiping Branch has made considerable improvements in its operations. Before liberation, the number of households that had their power cut off often reached 50%, but now it has been reduced to 1.5%. Illegal electricity theft has also gradually decreased. However, they are not complacent and are still constantly striving to overcome shortcomings. They recently received letters from some users expressing disagreements with the company's handling of power outages. These can be summarized into the following points: 1. After a power outage (i.e., wire cutting), in addition to paying a reconnection fee, users also have to pay an electricity deposit, which is too harsh on users; 2. Wire cutting consumes a lot of materials and labor; 3. The company's publicity work is insufficient, and not everyone who uses electricity understands the company's regulations. Based on these opinions, the company has humbly conducted research and review. Everyone unanimously believes that the company is now a people's enterprise and should strengthen the mass perspective, thinking about users in every aspect. If the past system was good, it should be retained; if there are unreasonable aspects, it should be modified at any time based on the opinions of the masses. Regarding the need to collect an additional electricity deposit when requesting reconnection after a power outage due to arrears, this was a method used by the Kuomintang in the past. Now that Beiping has been liberated and the people's awareness has been raised, it is indeed necessary to consider modifying this method of collecting an additional deposit. As for future situations where power outages are unavoidable due to arrears, they plan to take the following measures: 1. When a user whose power has been cut off requests reconnection, in addition to collecting the reconnection fee, the electricity deposit will not be collected. 2. The original method of handling power outages was to cut the wires. In order to save materials and labor, it has been decided to use the method of sealing the gate valve box, except in cases where there are special difficulties in the work. 3. It has been decided to conduct extensive publicity before implementing new regulations or changing rules, so that every user can understand and consciously implement them.

　　冀电北平分公司
  　虚心接受用户批评订出改进工作办法
    【平市讯】由于全体职工对工作的认真负责，和全市用户的协助，冀北电力北平分公司在业务上已有相当的改进。解放前应停电户数常达到百分之五十，现减至百分之一·五。非法窃电的情形也已逐渐减少。但他们并不因此而自满，仍在时常注意克服缺点。他们最近接到有些用户来信，对于公司处理停电有些异议；总结起来有下述几点：一、在停电（即剪线）之后，除交复电费之外，还要补交电费保证金，这对用户太苛刻；二、剪线在材料、人工方面都耗费大；三、公司宣传工作做得少，不能使用电者人人明了公司章则。根据上述意见，该公司虚心的进行了研究和检讨，大家一致认为公司现在是人民自己的企业了，应当加强群众观点，处处为用户来着想。过去的制度如果是好的，应该加以保留；有不合理的地方，也应该随时接受群众的意见，加以修改。关于欠费停电后请求复电需要补收电费保证金，是过去国民党的办法。现在北平解放，群众觉悟已提高，这种补收保证金的办法确有考虑修改的必要。至于今后如有欠费情事，不得不停电时，他们拟采取以下办法：一、停电用户请求复电时，除收复电费外，电费保证金不补收。二、停电处理原来是用剪线方法，为了节省材料和人工。除工作上遇到特殊困难者外，决定改用封闸盒的方法。三、决定在实行新规定或更改规则之前，事先进行广泛宣传，使每个用户都能明了，自觉的执行。
