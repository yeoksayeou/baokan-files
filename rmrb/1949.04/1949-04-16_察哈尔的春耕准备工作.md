Spring plowing preparations in Chahar

This year's production movement in Chahar Province has achieved preliminary results in March due to relatively sufficient preparation. Initially, the spirit of the North China Agricultural and Forestry Conference was conveyed through provincial and county party congresses, and various meetings such as district and village cadres and labor hero models. Extensive publicity and mobilization were carried out through market fairs and temple fairs. The Beiyue area held training classes for agricultural and forestry cadres. These measures have provided more adequate preparation for this year's production work. The Yishui Special District Production Promotion Society has purchased more than 100,000 jin of "Si" character cotton seeds and more than 40,000 jin of peanut seeds from Central Hebei and locally, and prepared more than 200 shi of Japanese millet. Each county in the Jianping Special District has prepared 134,000 jin of cotton seeds, and seven counties have prepared 83,500 jin of peanut seeds. Laishui, Wanping, Laizhuo, Fangshan, Liangxiang and other counties in the Pingxi Special District purchased more than 40,000 jin of cotton seeds and 49,000 jin of peanut seeds from Ding County. In addition to preparing seeds, blacksmiths in various places have begun to build farm tools. The Fuping Promotion Society subsidized blacksmiths and carpenters with 20,000 jin of millet to start their businesses. Laiyuan organized 15 blacksmith shops to go to the countryside to build farm tools. Before the spring plowing, all farm tools can be repaired, in addition to hoes and sickles. The Chahar Provincial Water Conservancy Promotion Society has also built nearly 1,000 waterwheels. The tubular waterwheels lent out in the Xushui and Wangdu areas are very popular among the masses.

All localities attach great importance to eliminating wasteland and rushing to cultivate uncultivated land. According to incomplete statistics, there are about 70,000 mu of wasteland in southern Chahar and more than 266,000 mu in the Jicha Special District. Both regions plan to completely eliminate wasteland in three phases: spring, summer, and early autumn. Concentrated efforts have been made to start cultivating the no-man's land created by the enemy, and it is planned to eliminate 200,000 mu in spring and summer. The Yishui Special District organized cattle plowing teams before the thaw and demanded that uncultivated land be eliminated before the vernal equinox. It is estimated that the Pingxi, Jianping, Yishui and other special districts can complete the cultivation of uncultivated land before the sowing of autumn crops. Manure delivery and firewood collection have also been carried out universally in various places. According to a survey of six villages including Daliushu in Fuping, more than 70% of fertilizers have been sent out from the Rain Water to the Awakening of Insects solar terms. Since the Beginning of Spring, the Jicha Special District has launched a firewood collection and manure delivery campaign, and 118 villages in Si Hai have collected 3.4 million jin of firewood. One district in Longguan collected a total of more than 4.19 million jin of firewood, enough for three months of firewood. In addition, the Jianping Production Promotion Society has purchased 86,000 jin of sesame bran, and Pingxi has purchased 40,000 jin of bone fertilizer. 300 jin have been burned, and the Zhengding Bone Fertilizer Factory can produce 500 jin of bone fertilizer every day. Xingtang and Jingxing counties have also purchased a part of bone fertilizer.

In this stage of the production movement, the morale of the masses is generally very high. However, some areas still do not pay enough attention to production work. For example, the Yanbei Special District has never submitted a report on production deployment work, and the Laiyuan production meeting was not held until after March 15. When the Yishui Special District inquired about the production situation in Wan County, the county emphasized that it could not do the work without cadres. Tang County arbitrarily changed the plan to plant 13,300 mu of peanuts guaranteed at the production meeting to 3,900 mu (this plan can be completed with strengthened leadership). Chicheng arranged for the promotion farm to try planting cotton, but the county's climate is cold and not suitable for planting cotton, so the county believes that the promotion farm is useless, so it divided the original 32 mu of dry land of the promotion farm to the farmers. These all show that some counties still do not pay enough attention to production and lack long-term construction ideas. (Yi)

### 察哈尔的春耕准备工作

　　察哈尔的春耕准备工作
    今年察哈尔全省的生产运动，由于准备工作比较充分，在三月份中已得到初步成绩。开始曾通过省、县党代表会，和区村干部、劳动英雄模范等各种会议，传达了华北农林会议的精神，又经过集市、庙会进行了广泛的宣传动员，北岳地区曾召开了农林干部训练班，这些措施，使今年的生产工作，有了较充分的准备。现易水专区生产推进社已从冀中及本地购到斯字棉籽十余万斤，花生种籽四万多斤，准备好日本谷子二百余石。建屏专区各县已准备棉籽十三万四千斤，七个县准备花生种八万三千五百斤。平西专区的涞水、宛平、涞涿、房山、良乡等县由定县购到棉籽四万余斤，花生种籽四万九千斤。除准备好籽种外，各地铁匠炉都已开始打造农具。阜平推进社以两万斤小米扶植铁工、木工开张营业。涞源更组织十五个铁匠炉，下乡巡回打造农具。在春耕前，除了锄头、镰刀外，可把所有农具修补齐全。察省水利推进社，更造出了水车近一千辆。在徐水、望都地区贷出的管子水车，很受群众欢迎。
    各地对消灭荒地、抢耕白茬地很是重视。据不完整的统计，察南约有荒地七万亩，冀察专区有二十六万六千余亩。这两个地区都计划分春、夏、秋初三期完全消灭荒地。曾被敌人造成的无人区已集中力量开始抢耕，计划于春、夏消灭二十万亩。易水专区在开冻前即组织了牛犋，要求在春分前消灭白茬地。估计平西、建屏、易水等专区在大秋作物播种前，可将白茬地耕完。各地的送粪、打柴也已普遍的进行。据阜平大柳树等六个村的调查，自雨水至惊蛰，已送出肥料百分之七十以上。冀察专区自立春后，即开展了打柴送粪运动，四海一百一十八个村已打柴三百四十万斤。龙关一个区共打柴四百一十九万余斤，足够三个月的烧柴。此外，建屏生产推进社已买麻糁八万六千斤，平西买骨肥四万斤，现已烧制三百斤，正定骨肥厂每天能出骨肥五百斤，行唐、井陉两县也都买了一部分骨肥。
    在这一阶段生产运动中，群众情绪一般都很高涨。但部分地区对于生产工作仍重视不够，如雁北专区始终未作生产布置工作的报告，涞源生产会议迟至三月十五日以后才召开。易水专区询问完县生产情况时，该县竟强调没有干部没法做工作。唐县更把在生产会议上保证种花生一万三千三百亩的计划，随便改变成三千九百亩（该项计划加强领导是可以完成的）。赤城给推广场布置试种棉花，但该县气候寒冷，不适合种棉，该县就认为推广场没有什么用，于是就把推广场原有的旱地三十二亩分给了农民。这些都说明了某些县份对生产仍重视不够，缺乏长期建设思想。（逸）
