　　North China New Youth League Congress
    Cables Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu
  　Resolves to Intensify Study to Become the Party's Reserve Force

    Chairman Mao:
    The first North China Congress of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League has now successfully concluded. The history of the League's establishment in North China over the past two years fully proves the correctness of the Central Committee's policy on building the League. All 40,000 League members in North China, closely united under Chairman Mao's banner, together with the broad masses of youth in North China, are intensifying their studies and working tirelessly to completely overthrow imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, and to establish a new democratic North China and the People's Republic of China. The work we have done is still little, and the shortcomings are still many. We clearly know that the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people have great hopes for the youth, and they are very concerned and cherish us. The historical task that the people have given us is great and arduous. We must truly become a powerful assistant to the Party and the People's Government. We must not fail to live up to the extremely glorious title of the Party's reserve army. We are determined to follow Chairman Mao's guidance, to be neither arrogant nor rash, to be prudent and humble, to further strengthen the study of Marxism-Leninism, to improve our technical culture, to actively work in various work positions, to strive to complete and exceed the tasks, to expand the League's organization, and to unite the broad masses of youth to further develop the youth movement in North China!
  　The First North China Congress of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League
    April 7th
    Commander-in-Chief Zhu, to all instructors of the People's Liberation Army:
    Thanks to the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao and your leadership; thanks to the brave fighting of all commanders and fighters and the support of the broad masses of people, the People's Liberation Army is about to liberate all of China. We are holding our first congress in liberated Beiping, and all the delegates warmly pay high respect and gratitude to the ever-victorious People's Liberation Army!
    In order to further mobilize all the youth of North China to work with the People's Liberation Army to carry the revolution through to the end. Our congress has decided that the Youth League must make leading the youth masses to support the front line its glorious task at present. We hope that you will give us more guidance and help in the future, so that we can better dedicate our share of strength in the cause of the people's liberation and the cause of building a new democratic country.
  　The First North China Congress of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League
    April 7th
