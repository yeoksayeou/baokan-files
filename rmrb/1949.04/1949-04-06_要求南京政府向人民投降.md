　　Chairman Mao Zedong, in his reply to General Fu Zuoyi, said: "The Nanjing Kuomintang reactionary government's policy of launching a counter-revolutionary civil war is completely wrong. The Chinese people have suffered immense disasters due to this counter-revolutionary civil war in recent years, and this government must be held responsible. However, the civil and military officials of the Kuomintang reactionary government who implement this policy, as long as they recognize right and wrong, repent sincerely, act out of genuine sincerity, and have concrete actions that are conducive to the advancement of the people's liberation cause and to the peaceful resolution of domestic problems, no matter who they are, we welcome them." All military, political, party affairs, economic, and cultural personnel in the Nanjing Kuomintang government and its local government party, government, and military systems should study this call carefully.

　　The Kuomintang reactionary traitorous government bears full responsibility for the counter-revolutionary civil war since Japan's surrender, and all important responsible party, government, and military personnel of this government must also bear certain responsibilities according to the severity of their circumstances. All important responsible party, government, and military personnel of this government have committed crimes against the people for many years. If they want to seek the people's forgiveness at the last moment, then they must "recognize right and wrong, repent sincerely, act out of genuine sincerity, and have concrete actions that are conducive to the advancement of the people's liberation cause and to the peaceful resolution of domestic problems." This is called "atoning for one's crimes by good deeds." If they cannot do these things, then the people will absolutely not forgive their ironclad and well-documented crimes, and they will absolutely not escape the people's trial and punishment.

　　Many Kuomintang party, government, and military personnel have now begun to adopt an honest attitude of atoning for their crimes. The April 1st circular telegram of General Fu Zuoyi, former Commander-in-Chief of the Kuomintang North China "剿匪" [bandit suppression], expresses this honest attitude. However, many key military and political figures of the Nanjing Kuomintang reactionary traitorous government have not yet intended to do so. They also express the hope of participating in the peaceful resolution of domestic problems, but like Chiang Kai-shek and his die-hard followers, who continue to advocate war, they oppose the continued advance of the People's Liberation Army, oppose accepting the CCP's eight terms, and absurdly advocate so-called "equal and glorious peace" instead of so-called surrender. The counter-revolutionary essence of this absurd argument has been fully exposed in the instructions of the Kuomintang Central Propaganda Department published by this agency today. This instruction proves that those heroes who oppose so-called surrender "cannot admit today's failure as the final failure of China's anti-communist struggle," but regard it as merely "a ripple" in the world's anti-communist struggle, and that "only surrender to the CCP" would be "our final failure." Why do they demand so-called "equal and glorious peace"? Because they refuse to take responsibility for the counter-revolutionary civil war, they refuse to hand over war criminals to the people for punishment, they refuse to hand over the reactionary army to the people for reorganization, and they refuse to hand over the reactionary government to the people for takeover. They want to preserve the reactionary forces "equally" and "gloriously" as capital for a comeback. They even demand to restore the status of the old Political Consultative Conference in January 1946, demand an unconditional ceasefire on the spot, and demand that the People's Liberation Army not go south of the Yangtze River to liberate more than 200 million oppressed compatriots. In short, they pretend as if they are not a group of reactionary and traitorous war criminals, pretend as if they have not "finally failed," and arrogantly demand to stand on an equal footing with the Chinese revolutionary people and their leader, the Chinese Communist Party, who are fighting for independence, democracy, and peace. This is an extremely absurd, extremely arrogant, and extremely reactionary attitude, which is completely incompatible with the attitude of atoning for one's crimes.

　　There is absolutely no allowance for talking about equality between reactionary traitorous war criminals and the revolutionary people. To allow such equality is to betray the people, to obliterate right and wrong, to obliterate war responsibility, to encourage counter-revolutionary war criminals to launch war anew, and to make the compatriots slaughtered by war criminals and the martyrs who shed blood for self-defense and liberation unable to rest in peace. In the forty-four months since Japan's surrender, the Kuomintang reactionary traitorous government, with the support of American imperialists, has repeatedly rejected the people's demands for peace, repeatedly torn up agreements signed with the Chinese Communist Party and various democratic parties, and brazenly launched a civil war. Even Li Zongren, the pseudo-president of the Nanjing Kuomintang reactionary traitorous government today, said that it "not only destroyed the glimmer of hope for the country's possible revival after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, but also caused war to spread throughout the north and south of the Yellow River, with fields, gardens, and houses all destroyed and abandoned, and countless innocent people were killed and injured, with wives separated from their husbands and children, crying from hunger and cold everywhere. This tragic catastrophe is unprecedented in the history of our country's civil wars." The Kuomintang reactionaries, the executioners who should be held responsible for this blood debt, deserve to die ten thousand times over. Now the Chinese people and the Chinese Communist Party actually allow them to atone for their crimes under eight conditions. What great benevolence is this? If they do not know how to repay such benefactors, and conspire to preserve counter-revolutionary strength in the name of equality, so as to repay kindness with hatred in the Third World War they expect, how extremely vicious would that be?

　　War criminals also cannot demand any glory from the revolutionary people, because their past crimes are despicable, dark, and foul. If there is any glorious action they can take, it is to surrender to the people. The party, government, and military personnel of the Kuomintang reactionary traitorous government must understand that if you are unwilling to automatically and consciously surrender to the people from a political standpoint, admit your counter-revolutionary crimes to the people, and hand over your military and political counter-revolutionary armed forces to the people, and continue to maintain your anti-people stance and retain your military and political counter-revolutionary armed forces, then there will be no true peace between you and the people, and at most you will only be hiding dangerous killing intent instead of eliminating it. In today's China, there is only one kind of peace: the peace in which counter-revolutionaries surrender to the people's revolutionary forces from a fundamental standpoint. Only with this awareness can it be called "recognizing right and wrong, repenting sincerely," and only then can it "act out of genuine sincerity and have concrete actions that are conducive to the advancement of the people's liberation cause and to the peaceful resolution of domestic problems." This is the political prerequisite for accepting the CCP's eight peace conditions, and no negligence or compromise is allowed. The words of the Kuomintang Central Propaganda Department, with a few words slightly changed, are completely correct for the Kuomintang party, government, and military personnel: "Only when we lay down our butcher knives and surrender to the Chinese people and their representatives, the Chinese Communist Party and various democratic parties, and stop struggling against the independence of the country and the freedom of the people, will it be the people's final victory, and the complete demise of China's counter-revolutionary evil forces." This kind of surrender is beneficial to the people and beneficial to the motherland, and it can be hoped that the people and the motherland will forgive it. It is far more glorious than refusing to surrender to the people, continuing futile struggles, and being captured alive, tried, and punished one by one.

　　Kuomintang party, government, and military personnel who are willing to atone for their crimes to the people and the motherland! The final moment has arrived. Quickly distinguish yourselves from those counter-revolutionary conspirators who oppose surrendering to the people! Bravely admit your mistakes, jump out of the counter-revolutionary camp, and surrender to the people's side! This is the road to realizing true peace, this is the road to atoning for your crimes.

### 要求南京政府向人民投降

　　要求南京政府向人民投降
    毛泽东主席答复傅作义将军的电文中说：“南京国民党反动政府发动反革命内战的政策，是完全错误的。数年来中国人民由于这种反革命内战所受的浩大灾难，这个政府必须负责。但是执行这个政策的国民党反动政府的文武官员，只要他们认清是非，翻然悔悟，出于真心实意，确有事实表现，因而有利于人民解放事业之推进，有利于用和平方法解决国内问题者，不问何人，我们均表欢迎。”南京国民党政府及其地方政府党政军系统中的一切军事、政治、党务、经济、文化等项工作人员，都应当对于这个号召好生做一番研究。
    国民党反动卖国政府对于日本投降以来的反革命内战是要负全部责任的，这个政府的一切重要负责的党政军人员，也都要按照各人情节轻重分别担负一定的责任。这个政府的一切重要负责党政军人员，在多年以来向人民犯了罪过，如果他们想在最后的时机要求人民的宽恕，那么他们就必须“认清是非，翻然悔悟，出于真心实意，确有事实表现，因而有利于人民解放事业之推进，有利于用和平方法解决国内问题”。这样就叫做“立功自赎”。如果不能做到这些，那么人民就绝对不能宽恕他们的铁案如山、斑斑可考的罪行，他们就绝对不能逃脱人民的审判和惩办。
    国民党党政军人员中有许多人现在已经开始采取立功自赎的老实态度。前国民党华北“剿匪”总司令傅作义将军在他的四月一日通电中所表示的，就是这种老实态度。但是南京国民党反动卖国政府的许多首要军政人员至今还没有打算这样做。他们也表示希望参与和平解决国内问题，但是他们和继续主战的蒋介石及其死党一样，反对人民解放军继续前进，反对接受中共的八项条件，反对所谓投降而荒谬地鼓吹所谓“平等的光荣的和平”。这种荒谬议论的反革命实质，在今天本社所发表的国民党中央宣传部的指示中、已经暴露无遗。这个指示证明那些反对所谓投降的好汉们，“不能承认今日之失败为中国反共斗争之最后失败”，而认为它只是世界反共斗争中的“一道波纹”，只有“向中共投降”“始为吾人最后之失败”。他们为什么要求所谓“平等的光荣的和平”呢？因为他们拒绝对反革命内战负责，他们拒绝把战争罪犯交给人民惩办，拒绝把反动军队交给人民改编，拒绝把反动政府交给人民接收，他们要把反动势力“平等”地“光荣”地保存下来，以为卷土重来的资本。他们甚至要求恢复一九四六年一月旧政治协商会议时代的地位，要求就地无条件停战，要求人民解放军不要到长江以南去解放二万万以上被压迫的同胞。总之，他们装得好象他们并不是一伙反动卖国的战争罪犯，装得好象他们并没有“最后失败”，而狂妄地要求与为独立民主和平而奋斗的中国革命人民及其领导者中国共产党分庭抗礼。这是一种极端荒谬极端狂妄极端反动的态度，是与立功自赎的态度完全不相容的。
    反动卖国的战争罪犯与革命人民之间根本不允许讲什么平等。如果允许讲这种平等，就是背叛人民，就是抹煞是非，抹煞战争责任，就是鼓励反革命战争罪犯从新发动战争，就是使被战争罪犯们所屠杀的同胞和为自卫和解放而流血的先烈死不瞑目。在日本投降以来四十四个月中，国民党反动卖国政府在美国帝国主义者的支持之下，无数次地拒绝人民的和平要求，无数次地撕毁与中国共产党和各民主党派签订的协定，悍然发动内战，连今天南京国民党反动卖国政府的伪代总统李宗仁也说是“不仅将抗战胜利后国家可能复兴之一线生机毁灭无遗，而战祸遍及黄河南北，田园庐舍，悉遭摧毁荒废，无辜人民之死伤成千累万，妻离子散啼饥号寒者到处皆是。此一惨绝人寰的浩劫，实为我国内战史上空前所未有”。应对这一笔血债负责的刽子手国民党反动派，万死不足以蔽其辜。现在中国人民和中国共产党居然允许其在八项条件下立功自赎，这是何等的皇恩浩荡？如果对于这样的恩人还不知报答，阴谋在平等的名义下保存反革命实力，以便在他们所期待的第三次世界大战中恩将仇报，这又是何等的穷凶极恶？
    战争罪犯同样也不能向革命的人民要求什么光荣，因为他们过去的罪恶是卑鄙的，黑暗的，瘟臭的。如果说他们可以有什么光荣的行动，这就是向人民投降。国民党反动卖国政府的党政军人员们必须明了：如果你们不愿意自动自觉地从政治立场上向人民投降，向人民承认自己的反革命罪恶，向人民缴出自己的军事上和政治上的反革命武装，而继续保留自己的反人民的立场，保留自己的军事上和政治上的反革命武装，那么你们和人民之间就没有什么真和平，那么你们至多也就是把危险的杀机隐藏起来，而不是加以消灭。在今天的中国只有一种和平，这就是反革命分子从根本立场上向人民革命力量投降的和平。有了这种自觉，才叫做“认清是非，翻然悔悟”，才能够“出于真心实意，确有事实表现，因而有利于人民解放事业之推进，有利于用和平方法解决国内问题”。这是接受中共八项和平条件的政治前提，决不容许有一丝一毫的马虎苟且。国民党中宣部的话，稍微改动几个字对于国民党党政军人员就是完全正确的了：“只有吾人放下屠刀，向中国人民及其代表中国共产党及各民主党派实行投降，而停止妨害国家独立反对人民自由之挣扎，始为人民最后之胜利，亦即为中国反革命恶势力之彻底灭亡。”这种投降是有益于人民，有益于祖国的，是可以希望人民和祖国的宽恕的，比之拒绝向人民投降，继续无谓的挣扎，因而一个个被活捉，被审判，被惩办，当然要光荣得多。
    愿意向人民和祖国立功自赎的国民党党政军人员们！最后的时机到了，赶快与那些反对向人民投降的反革命阴谋家分清界限吧！勇敢地承认自己的错误，跳出反革命立场，投降到人民方面来吧！这是实现真和平的道路，这是立功自赎的道路。
