To avenge the dead workers, students, and compatriots! Workers and staff in the Kuomintang-controlled areas! Intensify your preparations, unite closely with students and compatriots throughout the country, and actively prepare to welcome the People's Liberation Army! We firmly support the eight conditions proposed by Chairman Mao and, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, will swiftly and thoroughly destroy the Kuomintang's reactionary and wicked rule, swiftly liberate the suffering workers and compatriots in various parts of southern China, and achieve genuine and lasting democratic peace throughout the country.
