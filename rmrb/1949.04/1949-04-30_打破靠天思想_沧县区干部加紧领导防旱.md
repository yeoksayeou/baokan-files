(Jizhong News) The land in Cang County's Fenghuadian District has been completely cultivated. Due to the drought and lack of rain, some cadres and masses have a "rely on heaven for food" mentality, are confused by the current difficulties, and lack confidence in completing production tasks. Due to these ideological obstacles, the sowing work has not been promoted smoothly. In order to strengthen production leadership, the district conducted a special review and found that most cadres believed that it would be difficult to complete the sowing task without rain. Regarding the planting of cash crops, some emphasized that the masses were not used to it. For example, district cadre Zhang Chenglong said, "What the county party committee requires is what it requires, but it may not be possible to complete it." Police officer Jiang's wife believed that the masses should plant as much as they can. They completely abandoned their leadership role. Some cadres could not go deep into the production work, and secondary cadres relied on primary cadres.

After the review, everyone unanimously recognized the urgency of the current task and the importance of drought resistance and sowing. They believed that the main link in carrying out the work was to first transform the district cadres, then break through the "rely on heaven for food" mentality of the village cadres and masses, organize them to overcome the drought, and plan to fully utilize the existing seven waterwheels in the three villages, ensuring that the wheels never stop and the people take shifts. Villages closer to the river should repair water diversion tunnels and repair old wells. We must use all water conservancy conditions to ensure sowing according to the season.

Regarding the planting of special crops, everyone proposed to guarantee the completion of the task. The county also lent the district 5,000 catties of cotton seeds and 4,000 catties of peanut seeds, which further increased the confidence of the cadres. The working method determined that there should be a focus on helping groups and households, discovering and solving problems.

### 打破靠天思想　沧县区干部加紧领导防旱

　　打破靠天思想
  　沧县区干部加紧领导防旱
    【冀中讯】沧县风化店区土地已耕完，因天旱不雨，部份干部群众存在有靠天吃饭思想，为当前困难所迷惑，对生产任务的完成缺乏信心。由于这些思想障碍，致使播种工作未得顺利推进。为了加强生产领导，该区特进行检讨，发现一般干部多认为不下雨播种任务难完成，对经济作物的种植，有的强调群众没习惯，如区干部张成龙说：“县委要求是要求，但不一定完的成。”公安员姜太太认为群众能种多少就种多少。完全放弃了领导作用。有些干部对生产工作深入不进去，次要干部依赖主要干部。
    经检讨后，大家一致认识到当前任务的急迫，和防旱播种的重要，认为开展工作的主要环节，是区干部首先转变，再打通村干部及群众靠天吃饭的思想，组织起来战胜天旱，计划将三村现有的七辆水车完全使用起来，作到歇人不歇车，离河较近村庄修治涵水洞，重新修理旧井。利用一切水利条件，一定作到按季节下种。
    关于种特种作物，大家提出保证完成任务。县又贷给该区棉籽五千斤，花生种四千斤，更提高了干部信心。工作方法确定要有重点的帮助一组一户，发现解决问题。　　　　　　（赵广德、刘凯元、刘宝增）
