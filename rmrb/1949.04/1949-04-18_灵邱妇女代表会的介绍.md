Introduction to the Lingqiu Women's Representative Assembly

The Development Process of the Lingqiu Women's Representative Assembly

(1) The Lingqiu Women's Representative Assembly was gradually established and developed from the bottom up based on the demands of women during the land reform and production movements. In the early stages of land reform, when organizing the masses, no distinction was made between men and women, and they were all organized into poor peasant leagues and new peasant associations according to their class status (which was necessary in the early stages of land reform). Later, with the development of the movement, it was gradually felt that simply participating in poor peasant leagues and new peasant associations made it difficult to universally and fully mobilize the broad masses of women. At the same time, mixed-gender groups meant that, during meetings, only a few activists dared to speak boldly, and most women were afraid to speak. Therefore, many women requested to be grouped separately from men and to hold separate meetings. Based on this request, and also to further mobilize women, the leadership began experimenting in Donghe Village in the Third District and Shangbeiluo Village in the Eighth District, with good results, and women became more active in attending meetings. In January of this year, a county-wide election was held, and all villages in the county had women's representative organizations, with a total of 2,390 village representatives elected, 266 district representatives in eight administrative districts, and 35 county representatives.

(2) The emergence of representative assemblies at all levels: generally, elections are held by dividing villages into smaller areas or streets, depending on the size of the village or the number of women. For example, in Shapo Village in the First District, the entire village has more than 200 households, divided into eight neighborhoods, with each neighborhood electing two to three representatives, for a total of 17 representatives. Then, a representative assembly is held to elect seven representative committee members, who are assigned tasks according to work needs. In small villages, elections can be held by dividing into smaller areas, and one representative can be elected from every 10 to 20 women to directly reflect the opinions of the masses, convey current government work, and promote its implementation. However, in large villages, a representative has more than 20 women voters, and because the number is too large to lead effectively, it is necessary to form groups and elect group leaders to be led by the representative and help the representative carry out the work.

Once the village women's representative assembly is well-established, instead of convening women's mass meetings to arrange and discuss general work, the representative assembly is convened, and then each representative goes back to convey and inspect the work. This can directly solve problems and avoid the past problem of frequently holding mass meetings, which made the masses feel bored.

After the establishment of the representative assembly, village women cadres reflected, "In the past, when a few of us held meetings, we ran our legs off and couldn't find many people. Now that there are more people, it is more convenient to hold meetings. After the representatives finish the meeting and go back to convey the information, the task can be completed very quickly."

District women representatives are elected by village women representatives, based on the size of the village and the number of women. Large villages with more than 500 households elect two district representatives, while small villages with about 40 or 50 households can combine two villages to elect one woman representative to form the district women's representative assembly.

The county women's representative assembly is elected by the district representative assembly. Based on the size of the district and the number of women in each district, each district elects three or five county representatives to formally establish the county women's representative assembly. The Lingqiu County women's representative assembly has a total of 35 representatives, from which 11 are elected to form a representative committee. The 35 county representatives include rural working women, women from political and economic departments, female teachers, and students.

In each election of representatives, Lingqiu has been able to combine it with solving practical problems, which is very important. For example, the recent election in January resolved four cases of family disharmony, one case of early marriage, and one case of arranged marriage. At the same time, opinions were raised and criticisms were made about some irresponsible representatives during the election, while those who were active and enthusiastic in their work could be re-elected, such as Comrade Su Wenlian, who was re-elected three times and was supported by the masses.

(3) County representative assemblies are held seasonally and play a significant role. Last year, a total of three county women's representative assemblies were held. The first was at the beginning of the spring plowing season, where the women's representative assembly focused on discussing mobilizing women to participate in production and production competitions. At the meeting, the women representatives of "Shangzhai" and "Xiaguan" challenged each other. After the meeting, district and village women representatives went back to convey the message and mobilize women to participate in production. During the spring plowing and sowing period, 50% of the women were mobilized to participate in production. During the summer hoeing stage, the county women's representative assembly held its second meeting to summarize the spring plowing and arrange the summer hoeing work. First, the representatives' thinking was clarified and their enthusiasm was improved. They went back and widely mobilized the women to ensure that 50% to 70% of the women participated in weeding and tending the seedlings. At the beginning of the autumn harvest, the third representative assembly was convened to vigorously mobilize all representatives to lead the masses in carrying out the autumn harvest, so that women's participation became even more widespread. In this way, it was combined with the entire production season, suitable for the needs of the rural masses, and promoted production.

The benefits of the women's representative assembly:

(1) The representative assembly can reflect the opinions of the broad masses of women, further deepen women's work to the lower levels, and facilitate understanding of the situation. At each county and district women's representative assembly, the representatives who attend can reflect many specific situations and problems below, such as Su Wenlian and Zhao Yuzhi, and can often write letters to the county to report on the production situation of women in their villages. After the women cadres go to the countryside, holding a representative assembly is more effective than holding a full village women's meeting in the past, and it does not delay women's production, overcoming the shortcomings of not going deep enough into the work.

(2) The representative assembly implements and promotes democracy more widely and unites various different women. In the past, the Women's Federation mostly dispatched or designated cadres from top to bottom. The women's representative assembly is a representative elected from bottom to top at each level. Each election fully promotes democracy and allows women to discuss. At the same time, the representative assembly not only includes rural working women, but also includes women representatives from different fields such as political power, production, education, and Party affairs. Therefore, the women's representative assembly has become the core of uniting various different women.

(3) The representative assembly transmits information quickly and can widely exchange experiences. After the county representative assembly is held, it can be quickly transmitted to the village, saving the past when only a few cadres ran errands, and it can be widely transmitted to the masses. In particular, regarding production experience, at each meeting in Lingqiu, the representatives can tell everyone about their methods of leading production for promotion.

(4) The representative assembly can make the work style of women cadres more democratic. Because the women's representative assembly has a regular election system, each representative is very serious and carefully studies and discusses during the election before proceeding with the election. Because it is a representative system, the concept of the masses and cadres is also different from the past. Representatives represent the masses, not manage the masses, so the work style must be democratic. If you cannot represent the masses, you will be impeached. Therefore, those who do not approach the women masses and have problems with their work style receive practical education. For example, Meng Xiangying is a women's representative from Yewowo Village in the Third District. Because her work style was not very good, everyone did not elect her when she was nominated as a candidate, which was a great education for her. After returning to the village, her work style improved.

(5) The representative assembly can cultivate a large number of outstanding cadres: Lingqiu County has a total of 2,691 village, district, and county representatives. Active elements continue to emerge in the work. In the course of a year, a total of 40 village representatives were promoted to work in the district, including 23 who participated in political power work, including one district head, one deputy district head, one secretary, one deputy section chief, and the rest are assistants.

　　灵邱妇女代表会的介绍
    灵邱妇女代表会的发展过程
    （一）灵邱妇女代表会是在土改、生产运动中，根据妇女群众的要求，自下而上的逐渐建立和发展起来的。在土改初期，组织群众队伍时，不分男女，统一按成份组成贫农团、新农会（这在土改初期是必需的），后来随着运动的发展，逐渐感到只参加贫农团和新农会，不易把广大妇女普遍的充分的发动起来，同时男女混合编组，开会时，除少数积极分子敢大胆发言外，多数妇女不敢发言，因而，有不少妇女提出与男人分开编组，单独开会的要求。领导上根据这种要求，同时也为了更进一步的发动妇女，就在三区东河南，八区上北罗村开始试验，结果成效很好，妇女们对开会也积极起来了。今年一月，全县普遍的进行了一次选举，全县各村都有了妇女代表会的组织，共选出村代表二千三百九十人。八个行政区的区代表二百六十六人，县代表三十五人。
    （二）各级代表会的产生：一般的是根据村庄的大小，或妇女的多少，分片分闾分街进行选举，如一区沙坡村，全村共二百多户，分八个闾，每闾选出两个至三个代表不等，共选出十七个代表，然后开代表会，选出代表委员七人，按工作的需要分工。如系小村，则可分片选举，在十个至二十个妇女群众中，可选代表一人，直接反映群众的意见，传达政府当前的各项工作，并推动执行。但在大村子，一个代表的选民有二十个以上的妇女，因人数太多不便领导，须结成小组，选出组长，受代表领导，帮助代表执行工作。
    村妇女代表会健全了，布置讨论一般的工作，就不召开妇女群众大会，开完代表会后，由各代表回去传达和检查工作，这样既能直接解决问题，又避免了过去常开群众会，使群众厌烦的毛病。
    代表会成立后，村妇女干部反映说：“过去我们少数几个人开会，跑断了腿也找不到几个人，现在人多了，开会也方便了，有什么工作代表们开完会回去传达，任务就能很决的完成。”
    区妇女代表是由村妇女代表选出来的，根据村庄大小，妇女多少，选出区代表。大村如五百户以上者选区代表二人，小村如四○户或五○户左右的村庄，可两个村合选一个妇女代表，组成区妇女代表会。
    县妇代会是经过区代表会选举出来的、根据区的大小，各区妇女人数的多少，每区选出县代表三人或五人，正式成立县妇女代表大会，灵邱县妇女代表共三十五人，从三十五个代表中，再选出十一人，组成代表委员会。三十五个县代表中，包括有农村劳动妇女、政权经济部门、女教员、学生。
    灵邱在每次选举代表的时候，都能与解决实际问题结合起来，这是很重要的。如最近一月份的选举，就解决了家庭不和四件，早婚一件，买卖婚姻一件，同时对一些不负责任的代表选举时提出意见，进行批评，而工作积极热心的可连选连任，如苏文莲同志，三次连选连任，得到群众的拥护。
    （三）县代表会按季节开，作用很大。去年一年时间，共召开三次县妇女代表大会。第一次是在春耕开始时，妇代会着重讨论了发动妇女参加生产与生产竞赛工作，会上即有“上宅”与“下关”妇女代表进行了挑战，会后，有区村妇女代表回去传达，动员妇女参加生产，在春耕播种期间，即动员了百分之五十的妇女参加了生产。在夏锄阶段，县妇女代表大会召开了第二次会议，总结春耕，布置夏锄工作，先将代表们的思想搞通，积极性提高，回去广泛的动员了妇女群众，做到了百分之五十至七十妇女参加锄草＠苗。秋收开始时，召开了第三次代表大会，大力动员全体代表带领群众进行秋收工作，因而妇女参加的更为普遍。这样，就和整个生产季节结合起来，适合于农村群众的需要，推动了生产。
    妇女代表会的好处：
    （１）代表会能反映广大妇女群众的意见，进一步使妇女工作深入下层，便于了解情况。每次县区妇女代表大会，到会的各个代表，都能反映下边许多具体情况与问题，如苏文莲、赵玉枝，并能经常给县里写信，报告她们村妇女生产的情形。妇女干部下乡后，开代表会，比过去开全村妇女大会起作用较大，也不耽误妇女的生产，克服了工作不深入的缺点。
    （２）代表会更广泛的实行和发扬了民主，团结各种不同的妇女，过去妇联多是由上而下的派干部或指定干部，妇女代表会是自下而上逐级选出的代表，每次选举都充分发扬民主，让妇女们讨论，同时代表会，不但有农村劳动妇女，而且包括了政权、生产、教育、党务等不同工作的妇女代表，因此妇代会成为团结各种不同妇女的核心。
    （３）代表会传达工作快，且能广泛交流经验。县代表会开完会后，能很快传达到村，省得过去光是少数干部跑腿，而且可能广泛传达到群众中。特别关于生产经验，灵邱每次会议时，代表们都能把她领导生产的办法，告诉大家以便推广。
    （４）代表会能使妇女干部作风更加民主化。因为妇女代表会有定期的选举制度，选举时各个代表都很认真，细心的研究讨论，再进行选举。因是代表制，在群众中及干部的观念上亦和过去不同，代表是代表群众的，不是管群众的，所以作风上要民主，如不能代表群众，那要罢免你，所以对一些不接近妇女群众，作风有毛病的，都得到实际的教育。如孟香英是三区野窝村的妇女代表，因她作风不十分好，提出候选人时，大家都不选她，对她自己是很大教育，她回村后，作风有了改进。
    （５）代表会能培养出大批的优秀干部：全灵邱县共二千六百九十一个村、区、县的代表，在工作中不断涌现出积极分子，在一年的过程中，共提拔四十个村代表到区里工作，其中参加政权工作的有二十三人，有区长、副区长一人，秘书一人，副科长一人，其余都是助理员。
