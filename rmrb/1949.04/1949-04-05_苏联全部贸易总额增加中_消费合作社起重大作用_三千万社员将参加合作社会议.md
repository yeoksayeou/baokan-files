Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 3rd: According to a Moscow dispatch from the Electric News Agency: Mr. Heholov, Chairman of the Central Union of Consumer Cooperatives of the Soviet Union, announced that the trade of consumer cooperatives has played a significant role in the increase of the total trade volume of the Soviet Union in the past eighteen months. This is one of the characteristics of the Soviet economic life. The total trade volume of consumer cooperatives in 1948 increased by 18% compared to 1947. In rural areas, cooperatives sold 88% more woven goods to farmers than in 1947, 87% more shoes, and 65% more metal, porcelain, and glass. Cooperative trade has also expanded greatly in cities. Agricultural products sold in 1948 doubled compared to 1947. Sales of fats tripled, meat increased by 60%, and sugar increased sixfold. The trading network of consumer cooperatives added 27,000 stores last year.

Note: According to statistics published on November 11, 1948: The Central Union of Consumer Cooperatives of the Soviet Union has 28,000 cooperatives, more than 32 million members, and approximately 220,000 stores. The retail trade volume of consumer cooperatives accounts for more than 50% of the total retail trade volume of the Soviet Union.

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 3rd: According to a Moscow dispatch from the Electric News Agency: Members of consumer cooperatives affiliated with the Central Union of Consumer Cooperatives of the Soviet Union will hold meetings in the coming weeks to discuss work reports of the cooperatives, and will criticize current shortcomings with the utmost enthusiasm, and elect new boards of directors and supervisory committees. It is estimated that more than 30 million members will participate in the meetings. Last year, the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union criticized consumer cooperatives in its orders for being too slow in supplying goods under the new circumstances after the abolition of the rationing system. This order also called on them to improve trade methods, improve the quality of goods, and increase the variety of goods. Mr. Heholov, Chairman of the Central Union of Consumer Cooperatives of the Soviet Union, recently wrote an article in Pravda reminding members that incompetent cooperative staff should be replaced, and those who advocate necessary regulation of cooperative business, and those who are determined to seriously fight against waste, misappropriation, and theft, must be elected to the supervisory committee.

　　苏联全部贸易总额增加中
  　消费合作社起重大作用
    三千万社员将参加合作社会议
    【新华社北平三日电】据电通社莫斯科讯：苏联消费合作社中央联合会主席贺何洛夫宣布：在过去十八个月苏联全部贸易总额的增加中消费合作社的贸易起了重大作用。这是苏联经济生活的特色之一。一九四八年消费合作社的贸易总额，比一九四七年增加了百分之十八。在农村中，合作社向农民销售的编织品比一九四七年增加了百分之八十八，鞋百分之八十七，金属、磁器与玻璃百分之六十五。在城市中，合作贸易也大大扩充了。一九四八年销售的农产品，比一九四七年增加了一倍。脂肪的销售量增加了三倍，肉类增加了百分之六十，糖增加了六倍。消费合作社的贸易机构网中，去年又增加了商店二万七千家。
    按：据一九四八年十一月十一日发表的统计：苏联消费合作社中央联合会拥有合作社二万八千所，社员三千二百多万人、商店约二十二万家。消费合作社的零售贸易额，占苏联全部零售贸易总额的百分之五十以上。
    【新华社北平三日电】据电通社莫斯科讯：苏联消费合作社中央联合会所属消费合作社的各地社员们，将在今后数星期中开会，讨论合作社的工作报告，并将以最大的热诚批评现在的缺点，选举新的董事会和监察委员会。参加开会的社员，预计将超过三千万人。苏联部长会议去年的命令中，曾批评了消费合作社在取消配给制以后的新情况下，供应货物过于迟缓。这个命令并号召它们改进贸易方式、提高货物的质量、增加货物的种类。苏联消费合作社中央联合会主席贺何洛夫最近在真理报著文提醒社员们说：应当撤换那些不称职的合作社工作人员，必须把那些主张对合作社的业务加以必要的管制的人们，有决心对浪费、盗用和偷窃的现象进行严肃斗争的人们，选入监察委员会。
