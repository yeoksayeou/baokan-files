　　First Detachment of the Southbound Work Team
  　Progress in Ideology and Style After Two Weeks of Current Affairs Study
    [This newspaper reported] The first detachment of the People's Liberation Army Southbound Work Team concluded its current affairs study on the 14th of this month after two weeks of intense study (the first brigade had a longer period). Starting from the 15th, it entered the policy study phase according to the original plan.
    During the two weeks of current affairs study, the trainees made significant gains in their understanding of the current situation, their attitude and method of study, and their lifestyle: some had previously harbored some illusions about the Kuomintang; now they have a preliminary understanding of its essence; for example, some previously believed that the Kuomintang's role in the War of Resistance should be valued, but after studying, they recognized the Kuomintang's passive resistance against Japan and active anti-communism from various historical facts, and clarified that the victory of the War of Resistance was due to the merits of the Chinese people and the Communist Party. Some had previously overestimated the United States' aid to the Kuomintang reactionaries, but after studying, they understood the comparison of strength between the entire world's democratic camp and anti-democratic camp, and the advantage lies on the side of the people. In China, the advantage lies on the side of the People's Liberation Army. Some had previously held certain so-called "third party" views and attitudes towards the people's revolutionary war, but now they have a preliminary understanding of the just nature of the Liberation War, and their confidence in victory has also been strengthened. Some of the original motives for joining the group, such as finding a job, having poor family relationships, and wanting to see Jiangnan, have also been preliminarily criticized, and they know that they should "serve the people." Therefore, they have also stabilized some of the uneasy emotions they had when they first arrived. A member of the first company had a fiancée who did not want him to leave, but as a result, the fiancée was persuaded by him and also joined the Southbound Work Team. Some initially thought that studying was simply for their own pursuit of knowledge, but later realized that in order to serve the people, they must have the ability, so studying is also an obligation; some initially always liked to listen to large lectures and theory, and did not like to connect with reality; now they are beginning to connect with reality in discussions to solve ideological problems, and they also request labor heroes to talk about their personal experiences. In the first few days, they did not keep to their schedules, it took a long time to gather, they asked for leave a lot, and personal freedom and laxity were very serious; now they are living a revolutionary collective life in a tense and lively manner. They are punctual, gather quickly, and do not ask for leave unless absolutely necessary. The concept of labor has been initially cultivated, and they have begun to recognize labor as glorious, sweeping the floor, washing toilets, helping to cook in the kitchen, and repairing the playground, all happily. They have also been able to use criticism and self-criticism to correct the shortcomings of comrades, and mutual help and friendship in life have also been strengthened.

　　南下工作团一分团
  　经过两周时事学习
  　思想作风都有进步
    【本报讯】人民解放军南下工作团第一分团在历时两周（其中第一大队时间较长）的紧张学习后，时事学习于本月十四日结束，自十五日止，即按原定计划进入政策学习阶段。
    在两周时事学习中，学员对时局的认识上，学习态度与学习方法上，以及在生活作风上，都有显著收获：有的过去对国民党多少存在一些幻想；现在初步认清了它的本质；如有的过去认为应当重视国民党在抗战中的作用，经过学习，从各种史实中认清了国民党的消极抗日和积极反共，弄清了抗日的胜利是中国人民与共产党的功绩。有的过去对美国对国民党反动派的援助有些估计过高，经过学习，了解了整个世界民主阵营与反民主阵营力量的对比，优势是在人民方面。在中国说来，优势是在解放军方面。有的过去对人民革命战争也有某些所谓“第三者”的看法和态度，现在初步弄清了解放战争的正义性，胜利信心也加强了。入团时的某些为了找职业、家庭感情不好、想到江南看看之类的动机也作了初步的批判，知道应当是“为人民服务”了。因此也稳定了刚来时的某些不安情绪。一中队某团员有未婚妻不让他走，结果是未婚妻被他说服，也来参加南下工作团了。有的起初对于学习认为是单纯为了自己求知识，以后才认识到要为人民服务，就要有本事，所以学习也是一种义务；有的起初老是喜欢听大课，听理论，不喜欢联系实际；现在开始在讨论中联系解决思想问题，并要求劳动英雄来讲亲身的经验。初来几天，起居作息不按时，集合得半天，请假也多，个人自由散漫很厉害；现在则紧张活泼地过着革命的集体生活。遵守时间，集合迅速，非万不得已不请假外出。劳动观念已初步养成，开始认劳动为光荣，扫地，冲洗厕所，到伙房帮忙作饭，修整操场，无不愉快。他们并已能使用批评与自我批评来矫正同志的缺点，生活上友爱互助也加强了。
