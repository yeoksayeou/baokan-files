　　Cross the Yangtze River and Liberate All of China!
  　The Liberation Army Surges South
    The Broad Masses of the North China Plain Warmly Receive and See Them Off
    [Report from this newspaper] The masses in various parts of North China are enthusiastically receiving and seeing off the People's Liberation Army as they pass through on their southward expedition. After victoriously completing the tasks of liberating Tianjin and liberating North China, the People's Liberation Army of Northeast and North China are shouldering another great and glorious task—marching to the south of the Yangtze River to liberate the 200 million people of Jiangnan. On the liberated vast plains of North China, they are advancing south along railways, highways, and main roads in countless torrents. Wherever they pass, the masses have prepared the roads, sewn comfort bags, bought gifts, erected decorated arches, painted new slogans, and established reception stations in advance; men, women, old and young, have separately organized service, supply, sewing and washing, and comfort groups. They have also prepared food, fodder, vegetables, vacated houses, papered windows, laid out kang mats, and boiled water to welcome the Liberation Army passing through on their way south. In Hejian City, central Hebei, 338 women from 14 streets formed 71 sewing, washing, and comfort groups. When the troops passed through various villages and towns, the masses warmly received them. More than 3,000 people from 16 villages near Tang County organized a welcome team, beating gongs and drums, performing Yangko dances, and bringing gifts to welcome them outside the city. As soon as the long line of the Liberation Army appeared, deafening sounds of gongs, drums, and slogans arose from the welcoming crowd. As the troops passed through the welcoming crowd, eggs, cigarettes, peanuts, snacks, comfort bags, and tobacco pouches were stuffed into the soldiers' hands. The Yangko dances and "Little Devils" dances of the primary school students weaved through, twisted, and sang in the advancing ranks of the Liberation Army. When the troops rested, the primary school students performed storytelling with drums and Yangko dances, while women and children ran back and forth with pots to pour water for the soldiers. Some villages not located on main roads ran several miles to welcome them. When the troops encamped, the masses welcomed them into the villages, and receptionists led them to houses that had been vacated and cleaned long ago. The landlords brought boiling water for the soldiers to drink, wash their faces, and wash their feet. The soldiers, in turn, rushed to fetch water and sweep the courtyards for the landlords. The sewing and washing teams went to each squad to ask the soldiers for sewing work to do. In Hejian City, central Hebei, the South Gate sewing and washing team of 19 women mended more than 90 pieces of clothing, shoes, and socks for the soldiers in one day. The landlords were even more concerned about the sick and wounded. Liu Dafeng, a female cadre in Nanguan, Hejian, and others took out white flour and eggs to make soup for the sick and wounded, and covered them with quilts to induce sweating. As soon as the troops were stationed, people went to help the cooks chop vegetables, wash rice, boil water, and cook. In Nanguan, Hejian, 30 households helped make 180 jin of pancakes at one time. When the hero company, which won the Chairman Mao Medal in the Liaoxi campaign, stayed in Hejian, they held a get-together with local cadres and the masses. The soldiers told stories of annihilating the enemy on the battlefield, and the village cadres told how they persisted in the cruel May anti-mopping-up campaign and how they fought down the landlords and distributed the land, encouraging each other. When the troops set off, the masses organized a warm send-off. Some villages even rushed to make flags to present to the victorious army on their southward expedition. Shangzhuangtou Village in Lincheng, western Hebei, wrote "Defenders of the People" on the large red flag presented to the Liberation Army. When the welcoming team shouted slogans such as "Welcome the People's Liberation Army to the south of the Yangtze River, capture Chiang Kai-shek alive!" and "We will support you wherever you fight!", the soldiers also shouted the slogan "We will cross the Yangtze River and liberate all of China!" to respond to the enthusiastic reception and send-off from the masses. Currently, after seeing off the first batch of Liberation Army advancing southward, the masses in various places are busy welcoming, receiving, and seeing off the second batch, the third batch... of the Liberation Army on their southern expedition.
