Brief Comments

    Bandit Xie Shifeng Captured
    The capture of Zhangshi robber Xie Shifeng and others proves once again that in the people's city, any fierce bandit or special agent cannot escape the people's justice. The matter is very simple: our Public Security Bureau maintains democratic order and eliminates harm for the people, so it can obtain various assistance from the broad masses of people at any time and any place, leaving bandits nowhere to hide. We are telling the hidden bandits who attempt to continue to harm the people to quickly repent and register with the government. If they can truly correct their past mistakes, the government will give them lenient treatment. Otherwise, if they stubbornly persist in their errors and continue to do evil, they will inevitably suffer the sanctions of the government's law, just like Xie Shifeng and others.
   The Branch Should Become the Core of Leading Production
    How to improve production and become prosperous through labor is the urgent demand of the masses at present, so the party branch should take leading the masses in production as its main task. The Gaocheng County Party Committee plans to train rural party members in batches to further enhance the branch's leading role in production, which is very necessary. All localities should use various methods to strengthen the education of party members, dispel some of their ideological concerns, overcome certain erroneous ideas of "taking a break" after the land reform, and improve their ability to lead production, so that the branch truly becomes the core of leading production.
    Of course, strengthening the branch's leadership over production does not mean that branch members can arbitrarily order the masses; rather, it means that party members should patiently explain the party's production policies in production, transform the party's policies into the conscious actions of the masses; they should lead by example, use their own exemplary behavior to influence and promote the masses, and jointly embark on the road of prosperity through labor.

　　三言两语
  　匪徒谢世峰落网
    张市抢匪谢世峰等的被擒，再次证明：在人民的城市里，任何行凶的匪特，都逃不脱人民的法网。问题很简单，我们的公安局，是维持民主秩序，为人民兴利除害的，故能随时随地得到广大人民的各种帮助，而使匪徒无藏身之所。我们正告妄图继续危害人民的潜藏的匪徒，赶快悔悟，到政府登记，果能痛改前非，政府当予以宽大处理。否则执迷不悟，继续为非作歹，必将同谢匪世峰等一样，逃不脱政府法律的制裁。
  　支部应成为领导生产的核心
    如何搞好生产、劳动致富，是目前群众一致的迫切要求，所以党的支部应把领导群众生产作为自己的主要任务。藁城县委计划分批普训农村党员，以进一步发挥支部对生产的领导作用，这是很需要的。各地都应运用各种方式，加强对党员的教育，解除他们思想上的某些顾虑，克服土地改革后某些要求“歇一歇”的错误思想，提高他们领导生产的本领，使支部真正成为领导生产的核心。
    当然，加强支部对生产的领导，绝不是说支部党员可以任意命令群众；而是说，党员应在生产中，耐心的解释党的生产政策，把党的政策变为群众的自觉行动；应以身作则，以自己的模范行为，来影响推动群众，一同走向劳动发家的道路。
