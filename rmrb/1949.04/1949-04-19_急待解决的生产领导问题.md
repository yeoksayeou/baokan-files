　　Pressing Production Leadership Problems Awaiting Resolution

　　"The farmers' enthusiasm for production is higher than in any previous year." This is the new phenomenon after the basic liberation of the entire North China region, especially after the completion of land reform among 100 million people. Spring plowing reports from various places have fully proven this accurate fact. Launching this year's agricultural production campaign is a major event. Party and government organs at all levels above the county level in the entire region attach great importance to this matter. They have generally formulated annual production increase plans based on local conditions, issued agricultural loans, and paid attention to the organizational work within the loans. All efforts are being made to solve the various difficulties of farmers in terms of livestock, fertilizers, farm tools, and seeds. In many places, preparations for this year's large-scale production began in the winter of last year. It should be considered that these many measures are indispensable important steps in ensuring the completion of this year's production increase plan, and in fact, they have already played a great role in promoting the production movement throughout the region. What should be earnestly paid attention to at present is how to conduct inspections, how to effectively implement the production plan, and how to organize the production enthusiasm of all laboring farmers so that they can complete the production increase plan step by step.

　　If viewed from the specific leadership work of districts and villages, it is generally positive. However, spontaneous phenomena are still serious. First, a considerable number of places hold the mistaken view that "farmers' enthusiasm for production means everything." Some cadres in the Jicha Special Zone even thought that "last year, we could still persist in production in the environment of war, what problems will there be in production this year without enemies?" District and village cadres in many places in Southern Hebei, Shandong-Henan-Hebei, and Central Hebei have resisted leading production. They believe that "we have been busy all winter, finishing land reform, party rectification, army expansion... we have done everything, shouldn't we take a break this year?" "Farmers have land, won't they engage in production themselves? For thousands of years, no one has ever taught anyone how to farm." Starting from these erroneous viewpoints, they fundamentally abandon production leadership. Second, some leading organs have correctly analyzed that the farmers' high enthusiasm for production is only one of the favorable conditions for carrying out production this year, and pointed out that the difficult conditions in production are that farmers who have obtained land do not have enough means of production and production tools, the spring famine problem in some areas urgently needs to be solved, and farmers still have concerns about planting special crops... But there are generally more general appeals than specific help on how to overcome these difficulties. If there are "appeals" at each level, naturally the less specific guarantees there are further down the line. The Hengshui County Party Committee discovered in its inspection and promotion of cash crops that some village cadres said: "We will call on people to plant if we are told to, whether they plant or not is up to the masses." The masses also said: "The call is over, we will plant as we plan." This kind of situation also occurs in a considerable number of areas.

　　Therefore, the concept that "production must have leadership" should be educated among cadres at all levels, and thoroughly understood. Not only that, but the leadership should also comprehensively grasp the specific situation of one village, several villages, or one district (like what the Pingxi Prefectural Committee did as reported on today's edition), analyze these situations, and point out where the main problems in the local area are. Is it a fertilizer problem? Or a livestock problem? Or a problem with the concerns of the masses? … If these problems exist at the same time, then it is necessary to understand which are the main ones? Which are the secondary ones? Which are urgent and can be solved? Which can be postponed? Then deal with these problems step by step, distinguishing between urgency and importance. At present, in clarifying the thinking of cadres, most areas treat the head when it hurts and the foot when it hurts, or talk about the importance of increasing production from a broad perspective, but there is less analysis based on different situations to point out the direction and provide specific help. The experience of many places has proven that to make cadres establish the concept of leading production, it is necessary to start by changing the leadership at the county level first, because the current problems are mainly below the county level. We have seen that the Party committees in many places believe that new cadres are weak in ability and should not be assigned too many tasks, and that it must be specific and so on. We have said before that specificity is very necessary, but some places therefore divide a whole task and assign it separately. For example, in order to ensure the completion of the planting of cotton and peanuts, they no longer assign the task of increasing the production of general grains, nor do they assign the task of delivering manure or building dams... If it is said that these ten days are for planting gastrodia elata and planting trees, then they feel that they can no longer promote planting other things. In fact, this kind of deployment method is exactly the opposite of the demands of the farmers. Every farmer has a small plan when planting in the spring. The problem is that his plan lacks foresight. He can only do things based on experience. He can hardly consider how to make production more in line with the interests of the country, and therefore more convenient for the improvement of his own production. The responsibility of the leadership lies in guiding them from these aspects, making it their own plan through the farmers' own experience and needs, and realizing it according to the farmers' possible conditions and our help. The recent method adopted by the Gaocheng County Party Committee in Central Hebei, which is to train party members in batches with the base point as the unit, study and analyze the needs of local farmers in the training, and implement the leadership's requirements and plans for production based on specific situations, we believe is also one of the ways to solve the problem of in-depth leadership, and can be used as a reference for various places.

　　In order to make the plan rationally completed, we cannot blindly push it down, but also check in actual work whether the production plan is practical, and revise it in time. The Sixth Prefectural Committee of Southern Hebei-Shandong-Henan recently discovered in an in-depth inspection that it was inappropriate to assign too many cotton planting tasks in grain-producing areas, and immediately made corrections. We believe that this measure is very necessary. Only by correcting those impractical deployments in the actual test can our production increase work be guaranteed. Otherwise, it will be counterproductive, harmful to the people and unprofitable to the country. This point should indeed arouse the attention of the leadership in various places.

　　Spring plowing and sowing has reached a critical juncture. In summary, to create a widespread spring plowing upsurge, the main thing is the problem of in-depth leadership. But the so-called in-depth should be timely inspection, good at discovering problems based on typical materials, and able to combine with the masses to study, analyze, and solve problems in a timely manner, rather than occupying one side and stubbornly guarding one village. At present, there are many problems in production in various places, such as the lack of livestock, fertilizer..., the problem of combining wartime service tasks with production, the ideological obstacles of the masses to the prospect of getting rich, the relationship between village cadres and the masses... Different regions have different problems. Without the in-depth involvement centered on the leadership of the county, these problems are difficult to be solved specifically from the village or district level.

### 急待解决的生产领导问题

　　急待解决的生产领导问题
    “农民生产情绪高涨，超过以往任何一年。”这是华北全区基本上已获得全部解放，特别是在一万万人口中已完成了土地改革以后的新气象。各地的春耕报导与报告中都已充分地证明这个确切的事实。开展今年的农业生产运动，是一件大事，全区县以上的各级党政机关都十分重视这件事，普遍的均依据本地情况，制定了全年的增产计划，发放农业贷款并注意了贷款中的组织工作。以一切努力来解决农民的牲畜、肥料、农具、种籽等各种困难。有不少地方，从去年冬季起，就注意了今年大生产的准备工作。应该认为这许多措施，在保证完成今年的增产计划上是不可缺少的重要步骤，事实上也已经对于全区的生产运动，起了很大的推动作用。当前所应切实注意的是如何进行检查，如何有效地把生产计划贯彻下去，并把全体劳动农民的生产热情组织起来，使之有步骤地完成增产计划。
    如果从区村的具体领导工作中来看，一般是积极的。但自流的现象，仍是严重的。第一是相当多数的地方存在着：“农民有了生产情绪便有了一切”的错误观点，冀察专区有的干部竟以为是“去年战争环境中还能坚持生产，今年没有敌人了，生产会有什么问题呢？”冀南、冀鲁豫、冀中不少地方的区村干部对于领导生产都发生过抵抗，他们认为：“去年忙了一冬，结束土改、整党、扩军……哪一样都办了，今年还不该歇一歇？”“农民有了土地，自己还不会闹生产，几千年了，也没见过谁还教给谁种地。”从这些错误的观点出发，便从根本上放弃了生产领导。第二是有的领导机关，已经正确的分析了农民生产情绪高涨只不过是今年开展生产的有利条件之一，并指出生产中的困难条件是获得土地后的农民还没有足够的生产资料和生产工具，部分地区的春荒问题还急待解决，农民在种植特种作物上还有顾虑……。但对于如何克服这些困难，却是一般号召多于具体帮助，如果逐级“号召”，自然越往下便越没有具体保证。衡水县委在检查推广经济作物中即曾发现有的村干部表示：“叫咱号召咱就号召，种不种，在群众。”群众也表示：“号召过去就完了，咱打算怎样种还是怎样种。”此类情况亦发生在相当多数的地区。
    因之，“生产必须有领导”的观念，应在各级干部中进行教育，彻底弄通，不仅如此，而且领导上应当全面的掌握一个村或几个村或一个区的具体情况（象昨日本版所载平西地委所做的那样），并分析这些情况，指明当地的主要问题在哪里，是肥料问题？还是畜力问题？还是群众有顾虑的问题？……如果这些问题同时存在，那就要弄明白哪些是主要的？哪些是次要的？哪些是迫切而且可能解决的？哪些还是可以缓行的？而后再分别缓急轻重有步骤地处理这些问题。目前多数地区，在弄通干部思想上，多是头痛医头，脚痛医脚，或从大道理上讲增产重要性的多，而依据不同情况去分析指明方向具体帮助的少。许多地方的经验证明，要使干部树立领导生产的观念，必须首先从改变县级的领导做起，因为目前的问题主要在县以下。我们曾看到不少地方的党委认为：新干部能力弱，布置任务不能太多，必须具体等等。我们前面已经说过具体是很必要的，但有的地方因此而把一个整体的任务割裂开来布置，如：为保证完成棉花、花生的种植，便不再去布置一般谷物的增产，也不布置送粪、垒堰………了。这十天说是种天麻、植树，便觉得不能再宣传种别的。其实这种布置方法，恰恰与农民的要求是相反的，那一个农户在春天种地时都要有个小打算的，问题就在于他的打算是缺乏远见的，他只能凭经验办事，对于如何使生产更符合于国家的利益，因而也就更便利他自身生产的提高，他难以考虑到；而领导上的责任，正在于从这些方面，给以引导，使之通过农民自身的体验与需要，而成为农民自己的计划，并根据农民可能的条件与我们的帮助使之实现。冀中藁城县委最近所订的以基点为单位，分批训练党员，在训练中研究与分析当地农民需要，并以具体情况作基础，贯彻领导上对生产的要求与计划的作法，我们认为也是解决领导深入问题的办法之一，可供各地参考。
    为了使计划合理的完成，也不能一味硬向下推，还应当在实际工作中检查生产计划是否切合实际，而及时加以修正。冀鲁豫六地委最近在深入检查中发现自己过多的在产粮区布置植棉的任务是不妥当的，并立即做了纠正，我们认为这种措施十分必要。只有在实际的考验中，修正了那种不切合实际的布置，我们的增产工作才会是有保证的。否则事与愿违，于民有害而于国家无利，这点确应引起各地领导上的注意。
    春耕播种已至紧张关头，综上所述，要想普遍的造成春耕热潮，主要是深入领导的问题，但所谓深入，应该是及时检查，善于根据典型材料发现问题，并能结合群众来研究分析与及时解决问题，而不是各据一方，死守一村。目前各地生产中存在的问题很多，如：牲畜、肥料……的缺乏问题，战勤任务与生产结合的问题，群众对发家前途的思想障碍，村干与群众关系问题……不同地区存在不同问题，没有以县的领导为中心环节的深入下去，这些问题是很难从村或区级得到具体解决的。
