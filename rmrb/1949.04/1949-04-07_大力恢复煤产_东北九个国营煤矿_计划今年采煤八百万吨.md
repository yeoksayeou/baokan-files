Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 5th. The nine state-owned coal mines in Northeast China, including the well-known Hegang, Jixi, Jiaohe, Xi'an, Tonghua, Saima, Fuxin, Beipiao, and Fushun, plan to mine eight million tons of coal this year. This was decided at the recent Second Northeast Mining Affairs Conference. The conference also stipulated the specific management policies for each mine in the future. The management policy for the mines in North Manchuria this year is to consolidate existing achievements, strive to rationalize production and scientize management, and step up preparations for restoration and construction projects. The policy for the mines in South Manchuria is to restore and produce simultaneously. In the future, all mines should strengthen transportation work, giving it equal importance with production. Seven million six hundred thousand tons of coal must be transported out this year to avoid coal accumulation. The conference decided that all mines should strengthen political education for employees to establish and improve new labor attitudes. On the other hand, they should pay close attention to the material and cultural lives of employees, especially mine workers' housing, medical and health care, and make necessary and possible improvements. The conference requested that all mines should promptly establish production committees and employee representative meetings to realize the corporatization and democratization of production management.

  　东北九个国营煤矿
  　计划今年采煤八百万吨
    【新华社沈阳五日电】东北著名的鹤岗、鸡西、蛟河、西安、通化、赛马、阜新、北票、抚顺等九个国营煤矿，今年度计划采煤八百万吨。这是最近召开的东北第二次矿务会议上决定的。该会议对各矿今后的具体经营方针亦有规定。北满各矿今年经营方针以巩固已有成绩为主，努力使生产合理化和管理科学化，并加紧准备修复和建设工程，南满的方针是一面恢复，一面生产。各矿今后应加强运输工作，使之与生产并重，今年内须运出煤七百六十万吨，避免存煤。会议决定各矿一方面应加强对职工的政治教育，以建立和提高新的劳动态度；另一方面应切实注意职工的物质生活与文化生活，特别是矿工住宅、医药卫生等，要作必要而可能的改善。会议要求各矿应及时成立生产委员会和职工代表会，以实现生产管理的企业化和民主化。
