A Visit to Qintun Middle School
    By our reporter Rong An

　　I. Growing from Battle
    I visited Taiyue Qintun Middle School at the Qin County station on the Zhuozhang River - Baijin Road. This middle school, like dozens of other emerging secondary schools in the old liberated areas of North China, was created from scratch, from small to large, using the collective labor and wisdom of all teachers and students.
    Just outside the south gate of Qin County, on the right is the turbulent Zhang River, and on the left is a row of neat gray houses, which is the location of Qintun Middle School. This place used to be a barracks for Japanese invaders and Chiang Kai-shek-Yan Xishan bandit troops. In 1946, when the bandits were defeated and fled, they carried out large-scale destruction, but with the efforts of all teachers and students of Qin Middle School (the abbreviation of Qintun Middle School, same below), this wreckage left by the enemy has been transformed into neat, simple, comfortable and beautiful classrooms and dormitories, becoming a good place for more than 300 students to study. Comrade Zhang Ai, the principal of the school, said with a smile to the reporter: This is much better than before! Recalling the past, he said: The birth of Qin Middle School was during the Anti-Japanese War in 1944. At that time, the Japanese invaders were still entrenched in Qin County and the surrounding strongholds. At that time, in order to meet the needs of young people in the Qin (County), Tun (Liu), and Xiang (Yuan) anti-Japanese base areas to study and train cadres, Qin Middle School was established in the remote village of Getuo in the mountains. In order to cope with enemy attacks, the school moved every few days, classes were held on the top of the mountains, sleeping in the fields, textbooks were compiled by ourselves, and sometimes we had to help the anti-Japanese democratic government mobilize the masses and help the masses in production and study. In order to solve financial difficulties, teachers and students once organized guerrilla groups to penetrate the enemy stronghold of Nanguan in Qin County, seized two war horses from the enemy, and used them to cultivate the land themselves. Students were both farmers and students. At the beginning, there was only one class of 50 students, and now it has developed to six classes with 350 students. In the past four years, more than 200 revolutionary cadres have been trained and sent to various work positions on the front line and in the rear. Now it is much better, especially since the higher authorities proposed the regularization of schools. Not only has the curriculum and school system been regularized, but also in terms of material equipment, although it is not as complete as in the city, it is much more complete than before.
    Subsequently, Principal Zhang led the reporter to visit the school's classrooms, dormitories, reading rooms, libraries, sports venues, etc. The overall impression here is: simple, clean, practical, and everything seems to be organized. Pointing to the various construction equipment, Principal Zhang said to the reporter: From doors, windows, tables, chairs, benches to specimens, wall charts and simple instruments, except for a few that were purchased and repaired by carpenters, most of them were made by teachers and students themselves.

　　II. Teachers are Responsible for Students to the End
    In the reporter's opinion, this school not only has new creations in the learning environment, but more importantly, the style and attitude of work and study of all teachers and students are fundamentally different from those of old-style schools. First of all, from the perspective of teachers: the teachers here, as Principal Zhang said, are not for "getting a meal ticket" or "earning some clock hours," but consciously serving the New Democratic education cause. Therefore, teachers are responsible for students to the end in teaching. Each semester, month, and teaching unit of the school must formulate a detailed and applicable plan and teaching plan in advance, and after full deliberation and discussion by the students, propose amendments before making a final decision. Before class, students should have a preview of the text, and put forward the difficulties and key points, so that teachers can focus on teaching, and students can also focus on listening to lectures. In order to improve their teaching methods at any time, the teachers organize a mutual listening system. For example, Du Hongye, a mathematics teacher, is very accomplished in mathematics, but he cannot teach students. After listening to the teaching method of another mathematics teacher, he made great improvements himself. In order to be responsible for their own learning, students often reflect their opinions on the teaching methods of teachers through their own organizations such as the student union, the Youth League, and study groups, and teachers also solicit students' opinions at any time for improvement. For example, geography teacher Zhang Yunzhong taught geography to the third grade last winter. He thought that the students were highly proficient and neglected the teaching of the text. After the students raised their opinions, he immediately corrected it.
    The reporter specifically interviewed Comrade Zhang Yunzhong, a geography teacher, who has been teaching for 20 or 30 years. He expressed that he would serve the New Democratic education cause for life. He is a model teacher, and he has many creations in his work. In addition to having full preparation before teaching, he also helps students preview before class. Because students lack maps, he draws the maps before teaching and prints them with mimeograph for students to refer to in their previews. There is no colored chalk for drawing maps on the small blackboard, so he makes colored chalk himself. In order to facilitate students' memory, he compiles the humanities, landforms, mountains, rivers, and specialties of each province into rhymes. For example, he compiles the mountains and rivers of Shanxi into: Guan Cen, Yunzhong, Wutai, Heng; Taihang, Taiyue, Luliang, Zhong (Tiao); Yellow River tributaries Fen, Lai, Qin; Sang (Gan), Hu (Tuo), Zhang, Dan Guhe root (that is, the place of origin). The products of Henan are compiled into: wheat, beans, sorghum, sesame, rice, cotton, tussah silkworms and tung oil, and more yellow cattle; Jiaozuo Liuhegou, the most abundant coal production, Xinyang and Boai, iron production is really good. These rhymes are sometimes initiated by the students themselves. Comrade Zhang Yunzhong is also a class teacher. The fourth group of the fourth class, the model living group mentioned above, is under his leadership.
    The spirit of teachers being responsible for students to the end is also reflected in the guidance of students' self-study time, which is truly patient and tireless. In extracurricular time or in the classroom, there are often students there asking questions and studying their lessons, and the teachers also study with them patiently until the students fully understand. In addition to going deep into the study groups during students' self-study time, discovering problems and conducting general guidance, teachers provide individual guidance to individual students with poor grades; adopting separate reports, inspections, and assistance. For example, student × Yuqing failed algebra, and after individual tutoring by the teacher, he scored 100 points on the test. In order to help and encourage students to work hard and make progress, in addition to giving spiritual and material rewards to those with excellent results in monthly and quarterly exams, the school often carries out competitive activities such as model classes, model groups, red flag grabbing, and airplane grabbing. And help students hold seminars and run wall newspapers to exchange experiences and promote learning. The reporter found more than a dozen kinds of wall newspapers run by the students themselves on the walls of the student dormitory and classroom. The central content of the wall newspapers revolved around the recently launched reading campaign. There are reading experiences, reading notes, reading afterthoughts, reading gleanings, etc., through wall newspapers to exchange experiences and commend models, setting off a wave of reading.
    Qin Middle School is a secondary school in a rural environment. Most of the students are children of laboring farmers. Among the 348 students, there are 37 poor peasants, 306 new and old middle peasants, and 5 rich middle peasants. Because most of them are children of emancipated peasants, they have a high degree of conscious learning spirit, which is very natural! Because they know that in the old China of feudalism and semi-feudalism and semi-colonialism, they did not have the learning opportunities they have now. Their learning consciousness, in addition to being reflected in the above-mentioned spirit of being responsible for teachers and themselves, can also be illustrated by two small things. For example: although most of the students here live very close to their homes, none of them delay their studies because of going home. In one semester, more than 50 students did not ask for leave at all. Another thing is that there is no need for teachers to invigilate during the exam, because there is no such thing as bringing or passing notes among the students. However, in old-style schools in old China, this kind of thing was commonplace.

　　III. Respecting Teachers and Loving Students, Enthusiastic and Lively
    The new style of Qintun Middle School is also reflected in the relationship between teachers and students and between students. In addition to being serious and responsible for each other in the classroom and self-study time, they are enthusiastic, lively, respectful to teachers and loving to students in extracurricular activities. First of all, teachers care for students meticulously. For example, last autumn, student Tian Zhongxiao suffered from fever and had a severe stomachache. Class teacher Du Yunting watched him until midnight, and only after inviting a doctor, taking medicine and getting an injection, and the condition improved slightly, did he go back to sleep. When student Zhang Huankui was ill, the class teacher also stayed up all night to watch over him. As for the teachers personally checking whether the students are sleeping well at night, that is the most common thing. In the relationship between students, the characteristics here are that old students are the best leaders and new students are the most favored. Whenever new students arrive, old students clean up their dormitories, paste windows, prepare bowls and chopsticks, deliver soup and water, and even provide a set of luggage for individual students from poor families with meager luggage. In learning, they also fully promote the spirit of mutual assistance and love among students. There is a mutual assistance covenant in their learning life covenant, and students who are progressing faster should help students who are worse. For example, student Zhang Huaiwang was not good at arithmetic, and often failed the exam. With the help of student Lian Shuli, he consistently scored 90 points on the test. In old-style schools, the training department often had to resolve some disputes between students, but the teaching department here often does ideological leadership for students. There are also constant disagreements among students here, but they automatically find someone to talk to, and at most solve them with a review at a group meeting.
    After the North China Secondary Education Conference last year, under the slogan of emphasizing regularization, after quickly overcoming the tendency of no planning, no system, and neglecting cultural learning, significant achievements have been made in improving the students' cultural level. The student's total score book in the fourth class of the school records: the average student score in November was 78.56, in December it was 81.75, and in January it became 83.58.
    Of course, Qintun Middle School is not perfect, and may be far from our ideal, but the reporter believes that it is indeed a model in the New Democratic education work.

　　沁屯中学访问记
    本报记者  荣安
　　一、从战斗中生长
    记者在浊漳河畔——白晋路的沁县车站上，访问了太岳沁屯中学校。这所中学校和华北老解放区其他数十座新兴的中等学校同样，经过从无到有从小到大，运用全校师生的集体劳力和智慧创建起来的。
    一出沁县城南门，右边是浊浪滔滔的漳河，左边是一排一排整齐灰色的房子，这便是沁屯中学所在地。这里，过去曾经是日寇和蒋阎匪军的兵营。一九四六年，匪帮们战败逃窜时，曾大肆破坏，但在沁中（系沁屯中学简称，下同）全体师生的努力下，这片敌人遗留下的残骸，已经变成整齐、朴素、舒适、美观的课堂和宿舍，成为三百多学生优良的学习场所。该校校长张艾如同志笑着对记者说：这比以前就好的多了！他回溯以往情形说：沁中的诞生，是在一九四四年抗日时期，那时日寇还盘据着沁县城和城周围的大小据点。当时为了满足沁（县）、屯（留）、襄（垣）一带抗日根据地青年求学和培养干部的要求，沁中便在山沟里的圪陀村成立起来。为了应付敌人的袭击，学校三天两头转移，上课在山头上，睡觉在野地里，教材自已编，有时还要帮助抗日民主政府发动群众，帮助群众的生产和学习。为了解决经费困难，师生曾经组织游击小组，深入敌据点沁县南关，缴获了敌人两匹战马，拿来自己种地，学生都是半耕半读。开始只有一个班五十名学生，发展到现在，已有六个班三百五十名了。四年来已培养出二百多名革命干部，输送到前线和后方的各个工作岗位上去。现在好得多了，特别自上级提出学校正规化以后，不但课程学制正规化了，就在物质设备上虽然没有城市那样齐全，但比较以前总算完备得多。
    随后张校长带领记者参观了该校的课堂、宿舍、阅览室、图书馆、体育场所等，这里给我的总印象是：朴素、整洁、适用，一切都显得有条有理。张校长指着各种建筑设备对记者说：从门窗棹椅板凳到标本、挂图和简单的仪器，除少数是购买和请木工修置的以外，大部分是师生亲自动手做出来的。
　　二、教员对学生负责到底
    据记者看来，这所学校不仅在学习环境上有新的创造，更重要的是在全校师生的作风和工作学习的态度，和旧式学校有着基本的区别。首先从教师方面来说：这里的教师，正象张校长所说的，他不是为了“混饭碗”、“赚点钟”，而是自觉地为新民主主义教育事业服务，因此教员在教学上是对学生负责到底。该校每学期、每月、每个教学单元，事前都要订出周密适用的计划和教案，并经过学生的充分酝酿和讨论，提出修正意见，才作最后决定。在上课前，学生对课文要有一次预习的程序，把难处和重点提出来，这样可以使教员在教课时有重点，学生听课也有重点。教员们为了随时改进自己的教学方法，组织互相听课制度，象数学教员杜宏业，他的数学很有修养，但是教不懂学生。在他听了另外一个数学教员的教法以后，自己就大有改进了。学生为了对自己的学习负责，经常通过自己的组织如学生会、青年团、学习小组等反映对教员教学方法的意见，而教员也随时征求学生的意见加以改进。象地理教员张允中，去年冬天给三年级教地理，他认为学生程度高，忽略了对课文的教授，学生提出意见以后他马上就改正了。
    记者专门访问了地理教员张允中同志，他是一个教了二、三十年书的老教员，他表示要为新民主主义教育事业服务终身。他是一个模范教员，在他的工作中有很多的创造。他除了在授课前有充分的准备工作之外，还要帮助同学们课前的预习。因为学生缺乏地图，他在授课前把地图画出，用油印印出来，让同学们在预习中参考。在小黑板上画地图没有彩色粉笔，他就自己亲手制彩色粉笔。他为了便于学生记忆，他把各省的人文、地势、山脉、河流、特产等编成韵语，如把山西的山脉河流编成：管岑、云中、五台、恒；太行、太岳、吕梁、中（条）；黄河支流汾、涞、沁；桑（乾）、滹（沱）、漳、丹沽河根（即发源地）。把河南的产品编成：麦豆高粱谷、芝麻小稻棉、柞蚕和桐油、更多产黄牛；焦作六河沟，产煤最丰厚，信阳和博爱，产铁真不赖。这些韵语有时候也发动学生自己来编。张允中同志又是级任教员，上面所说的第四班第四组生活模范小组，就是在他领导之下的。
    这里教师对学生的负责到底的精神，还表现在学生自学时间的辅导上，真正是循循善诱诲人不倦。在课外时间或教室里时常不断有学生在那里问长问短研究功课，而教员也不惮烦地和他们研究、直到学生完全懂了为止。教员们除了在学生自学时间深入学习小组，发现问题进行一般指导外，对于个别程度差的学生，则予以个别辅导；采取单独汇报、检查帮助的方式。象学生×余庆，代数不及格，经教员个别辅导后考到一百分。学校当局为了帮助和鼓励同学们努力上进，除了在月考，季考中对成绩优良者予以精神的和物质的奖励之外，在平时经常开展模范班、模范组、夺红旗、夺飞机等竞赛运动。并帮助同学开座谈会，办壁报交流经验推进学习。记者在学生宿舍和课堂的墙壁上，发现学生自己办得有十多种墙报，墙报的中心内容都是围绕着最近开展的阅读运动而写的。上面有阅读经验、阅读小记、阅读后感、阅读拾零等等，通过墙报交流经验和表扬模范，掀起了阅读的热潮。
    沁中是一座农村环境里的中等学校，学生绝大部分是劳动农民的子弟，在三百四十八名学生中，有贫农成份的三十七人，新旧中农成份的三百零六名，富裕中农五名。由于他们绝大部分是翻身农民的子弟，所以他们有着高度自觉的学习精神，那是很自然的！因为他们知道：在封建和半封建半殖民地的旧中国，是没有他们象现在这样的学习机会的。他们的学习自觉，除了表现在上述对教员和对自己负责的精神之外，有两件小事也可以说明。例如：这里的学生虽然他们大部离家很近，但他们之中没有一个因回家而耽误功课的。在一学期中，有五十多个同学根本没有请过假。另外一件事是考试时，用不着教员监考，因为在学生之中根本就没有带挟带递条子的这回事。然而在旧中国旧式的学校里，这种事情是司空见惯的。
　　三、尊师爱生热情活泼
    沁屯中学的新作风，还表现在师生之间、同学之间的关系上。他们除了在课堂上和自学时间严肃认真互相负责外，在课外则是热情活泼尊师爱生。首先是教师关心学生无微不至，象去年秋天同学田忠孝得了热症，肚子痛得很厉害，级任教员杜云亭一直看到他半夜，直到请来医生，经过吃药打针，病况稍轻以后他才回去睡觉。同学张焕魁病了，级任教员也是通夜看守。至于同学们黑夜睡觉，教员亲自检查是否睡好，那是最普遍的事。在同学关系上，这里的特点是老同学最好领导，新同学最受优待。每当新生一到，老同学就给他们打扫宿舍、糊窗子、备置碗筷，送汤送水，甚至有个别家庭贫寒学生行李单薄，大家也给他凑一套行李。在学习上也充分发扬了同学之间的互助友爱精神，在他们的学习生活公约里就有一条互助公约，进步较快的同学要帮助差的同学。象同学张怀旺算术不好，考试经常不及格，在同学连树立的帮助下，一直考到九十分。在旧式学校里，训育处经常要解决同学间的一些纠纷，然而这里的教导处，常做的事则是对学生的思想领导。这里的同学之间也不断互相发生一些意见，但在他们自动找着谈心，顶多在小组会上一检讨就解决了。
    该校在去年华北中等教育会议以后，在强调正规化的口号下，迅速克服了无计划无制度和轻视文化学习的倾向以后，在学生文化程度的提高上已经取得显著的成绩。在该校第四班学生总分数册字上记载着：十一月份学生平均分数是七八·五六，十二月份是八一·七五，一月份就成了八三·五八了。
    当然，沁屯中学还不够尽善尽美，也许距离我们的理想还相差很远，但记者认为：他确是新民主主义教育工作中一个范例。
