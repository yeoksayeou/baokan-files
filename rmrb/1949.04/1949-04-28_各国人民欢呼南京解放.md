Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, 27th: Reports from various sources: The news of the Chinese People's Liberation Army's victorious crossing of the Yangtze River and the liberation of Nanjing has been received with jubilation by people of all countries. Newspapers in the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies have placed the news of the Chinese people's victory in the most important position. In Moscow, Pravda published on the 25th, in a prominent position, the news that the Chinese People's Liberation Army had liberated Nanjing, the center of the Kuomintang's counter-revolutionary rule for twenty-two years, and reported on the Kuomintang reactionaries' desperate flight and the stability of Nanjing after liberation.

In New York, US Communist Party Chairman Foster and General Secretary Dennis gave speeches stating that the liberation of Nanjing is a milestone in the Chinese people's liberation from the oppression of its external and internal enemies. It was also said: The imperialists' plan to enslave 475 million people through military, financial, and political manipulation and use them as cannon fodder for war has now been destroyed. Their dream of ruling China and turning it into a huge war base to attack the Soviet Union and strangle the national liberation movement throughout Asia has now been shattered.

Polish newspapers on the 24th and 25th both published news and commentaries on the rapid advance of the Chinese People's Liberation Army on the most important pages. The Warsaw newspaper said: The failure of the Chinese reactionaries is not only the failure of the Asian reactionaries, but also the failure of US imperialism. The victory of the Chinese people has shifted the balance of world power in favor of the anti-imperialist democratic camp striving for progress and peace. The newspaper said: American bankers have spent 6 billion US dollars to aid the Chinese reactionaries (more than the amount the United States intends to spend arming the signatories of the North Atlantic Treaty), but it is of no use. This is the inevitable result of the efforts of imperialists and war-mongers when faced with the opposition of the people's will. The events that have taken place in China are so enormous that their impact extends to the entire Asian region, which accounts for half of the world's population. Undoubtedly, the victory of the Chinese people will accelerate the progress of the liberation movements of the oppressed nations in Asia. The Polish Peasant Newspaper stated: The failure of the Chinese Kuomintang marks the failure of world imperialism. When the People's Liberation Army entered Nanjing, a major link in the imperialist chain was declared broken.

In India, one hundred and fifty Indian male and female students held a meeting at Calcutta University on the evening of the 25th to celebrate the liberation of Nanjing by the Chinese People's Liberation Army. The students held a demonstration after the meeting, despite the Nehru reactionary government's ban.

　　各国人民欢呼南京解放
    【新华社北平二十七日电】各方报道：中国人民解放军胜利渡过长江、解放南京的消息传到国外后，各国人民欢欣鼓舞。苏联和人民民主国家的报纸，都将中国人民的胜利消息，放在最重要的地位，在莫斯科，真理报于二十五日以显著地位刊载中国人民解放军解放了国民党二十二年来反革命统治中心南京的消息，报道了国民党反动分子狼狈奔逃，和南京在解放后秩序安定的消息。
    在纽约，美共主席福斯特、总书记但尼斯发表演说，南京的解放乃是中国人民从它的外部与内部敌人压迫下解放出来的里程碑。又说：帝国主义者想用军事、财政和政治的操纵来奴役四亿七千五百万人民供其作战争驱使的计划，现在已经被摧毁了。他们要统治中国并把它变成巨大战争基地以进攻苏联和扼杀全亚洲民族解放运动的梦想，现在已经被粉碎了。
    波兰各报二十四、二十五两日均以最重要版面刊载中国人民解放军势如破竹的前进的消息和评论，华沙报说：中国反动派的失败，不仅是亚洲反动派的失败，而且是美帝国主义的失败。中国人民的胜利，使世界力量的对比，有利于争取进步与和平的反帝国主义民主阵营。该报说：美国银行家曾花费六十亿美元援助中国反动派（大于美国打算武装北大西洋公约各签字国费用的数目）一点用处也没有，这是帝国主义和战争贩子的努力，在遇到人民意志的反对时所遭到的必然结果。中国所发生的事件是如此巨大，其影响的地区，及于占世界人口半数的整个亚洲。无疑的，中国人民的胜利，将加速亚洲各被压迫民族解放运动的进展。波兰农民报称：中国国民党的失败标志着世界帝国主义的失败。在人民解放军进入南京的时候，帝国主义锁链的一个主要环节宣告粉碎了。
    在印度，一百五十名印度男女学生，二十五日晚在加尔各答大学开会庆祝中国人民解放军解放南京。学生们不顾尼赫鲁反动政府的禁令，在会后举行了示威游行。
