　　Shijiazhuang Workers' Congress Concludes
    Approves Resolutions on Strengthening Workers' Class Education, etc.
  　Decides to Launch "Red May" Production Campaign
    [Shijiazhuang News] The Shijiazhuang Workers' Representative Congress successfully concluded on the 6th, after a duration of twenty-four days. At the congress, the representatives clearly recognized the position and role of the working class in the New Democratic Revolution and further established their sense of ownership. They discussed and criticized the bureaucratic style of leadership in individual factories and unanimously adopted the resolution on the enterprise-based production and democratic management. They also formulated a consistent and unified direction and task to increase production by an inch and gradually build Shijiazhuang into a fully productive city to support the front lines and liberate all of China. In order to better accomplish the above general task, the congress discussed and approved the labor insurance measures for state-owned and public-owned enterprises, as well as resolutions on wages, working hours, and welfare. For private enterprises, based on the different characteristics of various industries, various interim measures for labor insurance, wages, working hours, and welfare were formulated for private factories and shops. The trade union of government organizations also formulated welfare mutual aid measures. The approval of these resolutions provided the workers with the most powerful material guarantee. To ensure the continuous improvement of workers' political, cultural, and technical levels, the congress discussed and approved the strengthening of workers' class education and the strengthening of education in communism and Mao Zedong Thought. The congress also elected the unified leading body of all workers in the city—the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions Executive Committee—laying a solid foundation for the city's labor movement to move towards complete unification, consolidation, and unity in the future. These are the most important achievements of this Workers' Congress.
    During the congress, the participants also listened to Comrade Liu Xiufeng's summary of the production increase and loss compensation competition and the call to launch a new competition. Representatives from state-owned, public-owned, and government organizations unanimously and firmly responded to this call. It is expected that a large-scale production competition upsurge will be launched throughout the city in Red May. The congress also elected representatives to attend the first North China Workers' Representative Congress.
