To the Editorial Comrades,

Please convey an opinion on our behalf. We are cadres engaged in workers' affairs in Handan City, and we have been doing this work for more than a year. We are very interested in this work, especially after the leadership helped us to clarify that we should rely on the working class in the city this year. We feel that the work we are doing is very important and we are willing to do our work well. However, there is a major difficulty in our current work, which is the lack of culture and theory, especially too little understanding of knowledge related to guiding workers' work. The files of the Labor University have been reprinted by the Jinan General Trade Union, and each cadre has a copy, but comrades with low cultural and theoretical levels cannot understand them, and it is not possible to take them to the workers' comrades for study and reading. We have now set up two or three workers' night schools, and some factories have stipulated a study system. The workers' comrades have a high enthusiasm for learning, but the schools do not have any reading materials for workers. We compile them ourselves, and human and financial resources are limited. When we go to Xinhua Bookstore to buy them, there are none. There are also very few things about workers published in "Worker-Peasant-Soldier" (magazine). This makes both teachers and scholars feel extremely difficult. Therefore, we suggest that the newspaper make a suggestion to the cultural and publishing circles for us, and ask them to use popular words to write, print, and report more about workers. Our specific requirements are: First, write some popular booklets on the files of the Labor University for staff and workers to study themselves. Second, write worker's textbooks (including literacy and political education) for workers' night schools to study. Third, publish popular workers' publications and readings. In addition to cultural and political education, the content should guide entertainment.

### 建议文化界出版界多写工人通俗读物

专栏：批评与建议

　　建议文化界出版界多写工人通俗读物编辑同志：
    请代我们转达一个意见。我们是邯郸市做职工工作的干部，我们专做这个工作也有一年多了。对这个工作很有兴趣，尤其是在今年领导上帮助我们明确了城市里应该依靠工人阶级之后，我们更感到自己所做的工作非常重要，很愿意把工作做好。但是，目前在工作里有一个很大的困难，就是缺乏文化和理论，尤其是关于指导职工工作方面的知识了解的太少，这使我们掌握工运的方针、政策具体领导与教育工人感到困难。劳大的文件，冀南总工会是翻印了，每个干部都有一本，但文化理论水平低的同志们都啃不动，拿去叫工友同志们学习和阅读也不行。现在我们办了两三个工人夜校，在有些工厂里规定了学习制度。工友同志们学习情绪都很高，但学校里却没有工人的读物，我们自己来编写，人力财力都受到限制，到新华书店去买，一本也没有。“工农兵”（杂志）上登载工人的东西也很少。这样使教、学者都感到极大的困难。因此我们建议报社为我们向文化界、出版界作个建议，请他们用通俗的文字，多写、多印、多反映报导有关工人的事情。我们具体要求：第一、将劳大文件写出些通俗小册子，供职工干部和工人们自己学习。第二、写种工人读本（包括识字和政治教育），供工人夜校学习。第三、出版通俗的工人刊物和读物。内容除文化政治教育外，应指导娱乐。
