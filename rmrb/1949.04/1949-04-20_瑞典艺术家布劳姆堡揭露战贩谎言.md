　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 18th: The Polish News Agency reports: Swedish artist Ylek Blomberg, in an interview with the agency's Stockholm correspondent, commented on the widespread global movement in support of peace, stating: To justify the new arms race, military alliances, and war propaganda, imperialists attempt to prove that the existence of the Soviet Union and the people's democracies is a threat to peace. However, none of these countries threatens any other country with war. The Soviet Union, from its inception, has sincerely striven for peace, disarmament, and international economic cooperation. Poland recently demonstrated its will for peace at the World Congress of Intellectuals for Peace in Wrocław. Blomberg then pointed out that all countries should unite to maintain peace. Finally, he said: "I personally firmly believe that the Swedish people will never allow themselves to be instigated to participate in violent actions against any other peaceful and democratic country." Blomberg, the head of the Polish delegation to this World Peace Congress, also participated in the World Congress of Intellectuals for Peace in Wrocław last year and is a non-partisan individual.

  　揭露战贩谎言
    【新华社北平十八日电】波兰通讯社讯：瑞典艺术家伊列克·布劳姆堡对该社斯德哥尔摩记者发表谈话，评论目前全世界广泛的拥护和平运动称：帝国主义者为了辩护新的军备扩充，军事联盟和战争宣传，企图证明苏联和人民民主国家的存在就是对和平的威胁，但是这些国家中没有任何一国以战争威胁任何国家。苏联从其建立之日起，即真诚力谋和平，废除军备和国际经济合作。波兰于不久以前在罗克劳世界文化工作者保卫和平大会上表现了它的和平意志。布劳姆堡继即指出一切国家应团结起来维持和平。最后他说：“我个人深信瑞典人决不会让自己被人家挑拨起来参加反对任何其他和平民主国家的暴力行动”。布劳姆堡是这次波兰出席世界拥护和平大会的代表团团长，去年曾参加罗克劳世界文化工作者保卫和平大会，是一个无党派人士。
