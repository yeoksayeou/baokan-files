Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 8th -- ČTK Prague: Czechoslovak Communist Party General Secretary Slánský published a statement in Rudé právo on the 6th, calling on Czechoslovak communist party members to strive daily to grasp the situation of completing the five-year plan in production. Slánský said: The main task of the Communist Party is to raise the undiscovered potential of the working class in the struggle to build socialism. The continuous increase in production volume is faster than experts estimated. Many experts admit that they themselves had narrow "expert" views. Some experts now admit that the output of the metallurgical industry may increase by 50 percent, while the five-year plan only stipulates an increase of 35 percent. Slánský criticized Communist Party members in some factories in the statement for "misunderstanding their tasks, they thought that implementing the party's leading role meant directing the factory manager, interfering with his power, and doing his work for him." Slánský said: Party personnel have no right to order factory managers, and no right to order workers instead of managers. The task of the party is to "invite the manager to attend the meetings of the party committee, draw his attention to his shortcomings, propose remedies for his work, and give criticism. When the factory manager does not value the rational suggestions and advice of the factory party organization, makes serious mistakes, and ignores correct criticism, the party organization has the right and the responsibility to appeal to the higher party organization. The higher party organization will review this and take the necessary measures through the appropriate administrative authorities." Slánský said: The creativity and initiative of the broad masses are the source of great strength. "Without Germans, without a single foreign loan, and facing the resistance of Western capitalist countries, our industry had already exceeded the pre-war production level by 8 percent on January 1 this year. This is because our government is supported by the working people, and we have obtained the help and support of the great socialist motherland, the Soviet Union." Slánský criticized all theories that allow for easing class struggle when transitioning from capitalism to socialism, pointing out that they are the opportunist theories of social democracy. He said: "Everyone knows that the theory of reconciling class struggle in the period of transition from capitalism to socialism has been accepted by the Yugoslav Tito group. This theory has been used by them as an excuse to throw themselves into the imperialist camp, restore capitalism in Yugoslavia, and try to conclude treaties with American and British capitalist countries."

　　捷共总书记号召全体党员
  　完成五年计划建设社会主义
    【新华社北平八日电】电通社布拉格讯：捷共总书记斯兰斯基六日在红色权利报上发表声明，号召捷克斯洛伐克共产党员每天都要努力在生产方面掌握完成五年计划的情形。斯兰斯基说：共产党的主要任务是提高工人阶级在建设社会主义斗争中尚未被发见的潜力。生产量的不断增加较专家所估计的为快，许多专家承认他们自己曾具有狭隘的“专家”观点。某些专家现在承认冶金工业的生产量可能增加百分之五十，而五年计划中仅规定增加百分之卅五。斯兰斯基声明中批评在某些工厂中的共产党员“错误地了解他们的任务，他们以为实行党的领导作用就是指挥工厂的经理，干预他的权力，代替他做工作。”斯兰斯基说：党的人员无权命令工厂经理，无权代替经理命令工人。党的任务是“邀请经理参加党委员会的会议，使他注意到他的缺点，对他的工作提出补救办法和给予批评。当工厂经理不重视工厂党组织的合理建议与忠告，做出严重错误及忽视正确的批评时，党的组织有权而且有责任向上级党申诉。上级党组织将对此加以审查，并通过适当的行政当局，采取必要的措施。”斯兰斯基说：广大群众的创造性与积极性，是伟大力量的泉源。“不用德国人，没有一点外国的贷款，面临着西方资本主义国家的抵制，我们的工业在今年一月一日已经超过了战前生产水平的百分之八。这是因为我们的政府为劳动人民所支持，我们获得社会主义伟大祖国苏联的帮助与支持。”斯兰斯基批评一切从资本主义过渡到社会主义时允许缓和阶级斗争的理论，指出它们是社会民主党的机会主义理论。他说：“大家都知道，从资本主义过渡到社会主义时期调和阶级斗争的理论已为南斯拉夫铁托集团所接受。这一理论被他们用作投入帝国主义阵营，在南斯拉夫恢复资本主义，力图同美英资本主义国家缔结条约的借口。”
