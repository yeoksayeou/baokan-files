Introducing the Information Office of the Beiping People's Court
	Court Correspondence Group
	Following the establishment of the Beiping People's Court on March 18th, the first thing to meet the broad masses of citizens was the Information Office of the Beiping People's Court, established simultaneously with the court.
	The Kuomintang's courts also used the name "Information Office." However, in terms of its essence, working methods, and relationship with the masses, it was completely different from our Information Office. The Kuomintang's laws and courts were bodyguards for a small number of rulers, used to rule and suppress the broad masses of people. Of course, its information office could only do things like: where to register, where to buy legal documents, where to pay litigation fees… In general, these things were to make the working people submissive and obediently subjected to exploitation and欺诈. Therefore, the Information Office of the Kuomintang's Beiping District Court was the place the masses were least interested in; it was the most deserted place in the old court.
	Our Information Office of the Beiping People's Court is completely different. It is a place where the People's Court understands the demands of the masses, solves the difficulties of the masses, and at the same time enables the masses to learn their policies and laws so that they can master and use them themselves. According to Wang, the president of the Beiping People's Court: The purpose of the Information Office is to popularize judicial work, and the main tasks are as follows: First, to enable the court to communicate with the people and eliminate the bureaucratic air of the reactionary court. This is also a concrete measure to smash the reactionary regime and establish a brand-new people's regime. Second, to reduce litigation, strengthen the unity of citizens, and strive to engage in production. Third, to publicize and explain policies and conduct policy education so that the broad masses of citizens can understand and master policies. This is a broadcasting station of the People's Court. Therefore, the People's Court requires the staff of the Information Office to put down their airs and stand among the masses (the parties involved) instead of standing outside the masses, let alone standing above the masses. Therefore, the Information Office is the most beloved place for the masses. As soon as the court was established, it immediately opened four rooms and allocated ten staff members (now increased to twenty-two) to receive inquiries. Some submitted legal documents, some asked questions, and those with minor disputes were waiting for immediate judgment and mediation. Some did not know how to write legal documents, and the staff had to write them for them… From 8:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m., and from 1:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m., at least fifty or sixty people came in and out every day. The long benches in the corridor of the Information Office were full of people. Every day, at least forty or fifty questions were raised and legal documents were submitted, which simply kept the staff busy and unable to eat. Although some of the staff had worked in the old court, they had never done such busy and diverse work. But this is the beginning of transforming and training them to be servants of the people, so they are willing to accept this test.
	In just five days, from the 18th to the 22nd, eighty-nine new cases were received, not to mention the large and small questions raised by the masses. Some cases were simple and the facts were clear, and twelve cases were resolved immediately. Some cases were not complicated, but the facts needed to be clarified, so they were referred to the district government for investigation and resolution. Some cases were complicated and could not be dealt with immediately, so they patiently explained to the masses the reasons why they could not be resolved immediately, and at the same time told them: "You can leave your legal documents, and we will be responsible for submitting them to the adjudication committee. When they officially accept the case, we will notify you to come again." The masses were very satisfied with this approach. Some people said: "This is different from the old government office. In the past, we didn't dare to say anything, but now we dare to say anything." Some said: "This is really great. A case like mine would have taken months in the past, but now it's solved as soon as we talk about it."

　　介绍北平人民法院问事处
    法院通讯组
    北平市人民法院于三月十八日成立后，首先与广大市民见面的，就是和法院同时设立起来的北平市人民法院问事处。
    单就问事处这一名称说，国民党的法院也曾采用过。但从其本质上、工作方式方法上，以及和群众的关系上讲，都和我们的问事处完全不同。国民党的法律、法院都是为少数统治者保镖，用以统治与镇压广大人民的。当然它的问事处，也只能作些：到什么地方报到，到什么地方买状纸，到什么地方交讼费，………一类的事情。这些事情，总起来说，就是使劳苦大众伏首贴耳规规矩矩的受剥削，受欺诈。因此，国民党的北平地方法院问事处，是群众最不感兴趣的地方，那是旧法院最冷落的所在。
    我们的北平市人民法院问事处却完全不同了。它是人民法院了解群众要求，解决群众困难，同时又是使群众学习自己的政策法律，以便自己能够掌握运用的场所。据北平市人民法院王院长谈：问事处的目的，是在使司法工作大众化，主要任务有以下几点：一、使法院与人民通气，肃清反动法院的衙门气，这也是粉碎反动政权机构，建立崭新的人民政权机构的一种具体措施。二、减少讼争，加强市民的团结，努力从事生产。三、宣传解释政策，进行政策教育，使广大市民能了解与掌握政策，这就是人民法院的一座广播台。因此人民法院要求问事处的工作人员放下架子，站在群众（当事人）之中，而不要站在群众之外，更不能站在群众之上。因此，问事处是群众最热爱的场所。法院一成立，马上开辟了四个房子，拨了十个工作人员（现已增到二十二人），来接待问事的人，有的提状纸，有的问问题，有小纠纷的，还等着马上评断调解。有的不会写状纸，工作人员还得代书，…从早上的八点到十二点，下午一点到五点，每天出来进去的人，至少有五六十名之多，在问事处过道里几条长椅上，尽坐满了人。每天提问题交状纸至少在四五十件以上，简直把工作员忙得应接不暇，连饭也顾不上吃。虽然有些人员是在旧法院工作过的，他们从来没有作过这样繁忙而多样性的工作。但这正是改造与锻炼他们为人民当勤务员的开始，因此他们也是愿意接受这种考验的。
    从十八日至二十二日，这短短的五天中，单说收的新案子就有八十九件，而群众所提的大小问题还不算在内。有些案件案情简单，事实清楚，马上可以解决的，共解决了十二件。有些案子虽然不复杂，但还需要弄清楚事实的，就介绍给区政府调查解决。有些案情复杂不能马上处理的，就很耐心向群众解释不能马上解决的理由，同时向他们说：“你的状纸可以留下来，我们负责给你交到审判委员会，等他们正式受理案子时，马上通知你再来。”群众对这种作法都很满意。有的群众说：“这可跟旧衙门不一样，过去有话不敢说，现在什么也敢说了。”有的说：“这可真痛快，象我这样的案子，在过去得拖好几个月，现在说说当下就解决了。”
