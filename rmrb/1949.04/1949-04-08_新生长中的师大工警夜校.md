　　The Budding Normal University Worker-Police Night School
　　·Qiu Xi'en·
　　In the past, the workers and police of Peiping Normal University received no education. The masters of the school did their utmost to exploit and oppress them in all aspects, keeping them in ignorance. At that time, we helped them establish a worker-police night school. But in the Kuomintang era, anyone who tried to awaken the laborers was guilty, and anyone who tried to serve the masses was persecuted. So, we had to do it secretly, risking a great deal to run two sessions. Now that Peiping is liberated and Normal University has turned over a new leaf, the workers and police have also turned over, and the worker-police night school has officially been established. It has received voluntary support from many students and financial support from the Cultural Management Committee. Today, it has become a school of considerable size.
　　To achieve the goal of education, we have divided the school into two departments: cultural education and political education. These two departments are closely linked and mutually supportive.
　　In terms of cultural education, the workers and police are divided into five classes according to their educational level: literacy, elementary, intermediate, advanced, and advanced study. For these five classes of students, a flexible promotion system is adopted. When teachers find that students are at different levels during teaching, they can be promoted or demoted at any time. For workers and police who cannot leave their posts, a mobile teacher system is adopted, where teachers go to the dormitories or workplaces of the workers and police to conduct education during their rest time. In addition, parallel to the Academic Affairs Office, there is a Mathematics Research Committee to collect and study more suitable teaching methods, using a combination of individual teaching, group discussions, classroom lectures, and mutual tutoring. At the same time, a method of combining teaching, learning, and doing is adopted. Appearing at the same time as the Teaching Research Committee is the Textbook Compilation Committee, which uses practical and closely related issues to the lives of workers and police to form the content of the textbooks, in order to arouse their interest in learning and to fulfill their conscious and automatic desire to study and improve.
　　Regarding political education, a Life Assistance Committee has been established, aiming to integrate teachers, students, workers, and police, to cultivate their labor service perspective for serving classmates, and to plant the ideas and knowledge of the new era into the lives of every teacher and student in the process of mutual learning. To achieve this goal, three departments have been established under it: first, the Organization Department, which divides the workers and police into living groups according to their residential areas, with students visiting, understanding, and educating them daily, using new policies and new knowledge combined with their actual life problems as conversation materials, to awaken their class consciousness and improve their political understanding. The second is the Culture and Education Department, under which there is a blackboard newspaper team, which excerpts important news from the newspapers every day and transforms cultural vocabulary into popular mass language for them to read, so that they can have some understanding of the times. The wall newspaper team assists the workers and police to publish their own wall newspapers every two weeks, so that they can record their life feelings, work experience, and learning experiences, so as to observe their degree of progress. The "Worker-Police Home," which is also the worker-police library, where they read, ask questions, and create, making it their life and learning center, becoming a home they cannot leave. The third is the Recreation Department, which introduces new knowledge of "preservation, health, well-being, and happiness" to them on the one hand, and organizes those among them who love music and art into dance teams and labor-meaningful Yangko dances and frontier dances.

### 新生长中的师大工警夜校

　　新生长中的师大工警夜校
    ·邱锡恩·
    北平师范大学的工警过去是没有进行过教育，学校的主子们在各方面都尽量剥削压迫，把他们蒙蔽在愚昧无知中。我们那时帮他们成立了工警夜校。但国民党时代，谁要唤醒劳动者就有罪，谁要服务大众也要受到迫害，所以大家只偷偷摸摸，冒了多少危险办了两期。现在北平解放了，师大翻身了，工警也翻了身，工警夜校正式产生了。她得到许多同学的义务赞助及文管会经济的供给，如今她已变成个规模可观的学校了。
    要达到教育的目的，我们把学校分成了两部：文化的教育，政治的教育。这两部是紧相连系互相辅导的。
    在文化教育方面，按工警们的文化程度将他们分成识字、初级、中级、高级及进修五班。对此五班学生，采用了弹性升级制，在教师教学时，发现了学生程度不齐，可随时让他们升级降级。对不能离开职守的工警们，采用了流动教师制，利用工警的休息时间，教师到工警的宿舍或工作处去进行教育。此外与教务科平行的有数学研究委员会去搜集研究更适宜的教学法，以个别教学集体讨论，课堂讲授互相辅导合用，同时又采用了教、学、作合一的办法。与教学研究委员会同时出现的有教材编纂委员会，是以具有实用价值的及与工警生活紧相结合着的问题组成教材的内容，裨引起他们学习的兴趣，以完成他们自己自觉自动的要求学习上进。
    关于政治教育方面，设立了生活辅助委员会，目的在使师生工警打成一片，对服务同学也养成他们劳动服务观，并在互相学习的过程中，将新时代的思想与知识，种植于每个师生生活中，为达成此目的，在它下面设立了三部：第一组织部，将工警们按居住区域分成生活小组，同学逐日去访问，了解，教育他们，以新政策，新知识结合着他们实际生活问题作为谈话资料，以唤醒他们的阶级觉悟，提高政治认识。第二是文教部，下设板报股，每日将报上重要消息摘录下来将文化语汇，变成通俗的大众话，让他们看，裨对时代有所认识。壁报股，辅助工警每两周自己出壁报一次，使他们自己将生活感想、工作经验、学习心得记录下来，借以观察其进步程度。“工警之家”，也就是工警图书馆，他们在里面读书，在里面发问，在里面创作，使其成为他们的生活学习中心，变成他们自己离不开的家庭。第三康乐部，一面将“保、健、康、乐”的新知识介绍给他们，一面将他们中间爱好音乐、爱好艺术的分子分别组成舞蹈队与富有劳动意义的秧歌舞与边疆舞。
