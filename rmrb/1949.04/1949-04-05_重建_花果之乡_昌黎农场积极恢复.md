[Jidong Telegram] Changli Farm, known as the "Land of Fruits and Flowers" in North China, suffered serious damage when the Kuomintang bandit troops occupied Changli. The entire farm was crisscrossed with trenches. One hundred and seven large fruit trees and more than two thousand saplings were destroyed. One hundred and sixty to seventy rooms within the farm were reduced to ruins. After Changli was liberated on September 15th last year, the democratic government immediately combined the original "Railway Farm" and "Fruit Tree Improvement Institute" into Changli Farm, totaling approximately 2,900 mu of land, and actively carried out recovery and reconstruction work. Since liberation, the farm's employees have been highly motivated. They are now stepping up the repair of fruit trees. All the workers and technicians are working together on pruning. The technicians are also taking the initiative to help workers improve their skills, thus greatly increasing work efficiency. Last year, the Fruit Tree Improvement Institute spent forty-five days pruning, and the pruning was very rough. This year, it was completed in only twenty-three and a half days. Not only was it faster, but the pruning was particularly fine. The farm's production plan for this year stipulates: 1. The office and warehouse in the experimental area, purchasing simple meteorological instruments and breeding improved breeds of livestock and poultry. 2. Dispatching technicians (twenty have already been sent to Tangshan, Zunhua, and other places) to guide agricultural production in various places. Promoting 3,000 fruit tree seedlings in counties east of the Luan River. 3. Cultivating 100,000 seedlings of wild pear, peach, persimmon, chestnut, walnut, apricot, grape, etc. Strengthen fruit tree pruning, fertilization, irrigation, spraying and other work. In addition, a large amount of weeds, fallen leaves, ash, and manure will be used to accumulate 900,000 jin of fertilizer, laying the foundation for self-sufficiency in fertilization next year.

　　重建“花果之乡”
  　昌黎农场积极恢复
    【冀东电】以“花果之乡”著称于华北的昌黎农场，在国民党匪军侵据昌黎时，遭到严重破坏。全场到处都挖了交通沟，一百零七棵大果树、两千多棵树苗被毁坏，场内的房屋有一百六、七十间成为废墟。去年九月十五日昌黎解放后，民主政府即将原“铁路农场”及“果木改进所”统划为昌黎农场，共有土地约二千九百亩，积极进行恢复重建工作。场内员工自解放后，工作情绪高涨，现正加紧修整果树。在剪枝工作中全体工人技术员一齐下手。技术员并主动帮助工人改进技术，因此工作效率大为提高。去年果木改进所剪枝四十五天才剪完，并且剪得很粗率；今年只用二十三天半就完成了，不但快而且剪得特别精细。该场今年的生产计划中规定：一、试验区的办公室、库房，增购简单的气象仪器和繁殖优良种畜、家禽。二、派遣技术员（现已派出二十名分赴唐山、遵化等地），指导各地农业生产。在滦河以东各县推广果树苗三千株。三、培养山梨、桃、柿子、栗子、核桃、杏、葡萄等幼苗十万株。加强果树的剪枝、施肥、灌溉、喷药等工作。此外，将大量利用杂草、落叶、灰土、厩肥等达到积肥九十万斤，打下明年施肥自给的基础。
