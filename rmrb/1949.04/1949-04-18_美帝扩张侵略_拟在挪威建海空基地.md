　　U.S. Imperialism Expands Aggression
  　Plans to Build Naval and Air Bases in Norway
    [Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 17th] TASS Helsinki: Local newspapers, citing sources from Oslo via Washington, state that the so-called "American Transportation Delegation" that arrived in Norway in mid-March is composed of American military experts, including military engineers, transportation experts, and other "experts." The mission of this "delegation" is to investigate Norwegian territory and ports in order to establish naval and air force bases. The delegation will also investigate Norwegian transportation equipment, as the United States intends to make this equipment suitable for the needs of the U.S. armed forces. To cover the expenses required for all these plans, the United States will provide Norway with long-term loans sufficient to cover 65 percent of the costs, according to the secret clauses of the North Atlantic Treaty. The remaining 35 percent of the costs will be paid by the Norwegian government. According to the treaty, the U.S. Army will have the right to use the aforementioned military bases until 1970.
