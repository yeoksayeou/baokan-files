　　Rescuing Frozen Agricultural Crops
    Jinnan Third Prefectural Committee Dispatches Personnel to Villages for Inspection, Orders Counties to Organize the Fight Against the New Disaster
    [Our Newspaper] The Jinnan Third Prefectural Committee Office received telegrams on the 14th of this month from Wei County, Guangping, and Handan stating that the climate has been erratic since the beginning of spring, with frequent winds and a lack of rain, and more cold than heat, severely damaging various agricultural crops. In Guangping's Fourth District, many wheat crops have been frozen to death, and rapeseed flowers in the Second, Third, and Fourth Districts have also been damaged by frost. Feixiang County has reached the time for planting cotton, but if it does not rain again, cotton planting will be difficult. The Third Prefectural Committee attaches great importance to this situation and is now reporting it to higher authorities. At the same time, it is directly dispatching personnel to villages for inspection and urgently urging all counties to quickly assign specialists to personally go to the disaster areas, understand the situation in detail, and deeply solicit the masses' opinions on rescue methods for various crops that have been frozen to death or damaged by frost, planning to organize a vigorous and resolute fight against the new disaster.

　　抢救冻坏农产作物
    冀南三地委派员下乡勘察　令各县组织向新灾作斗争
    【本报讯】冀南三地委办公室于本月十四日接得魏县、广平、邯郸电告：入春以来气候不调，风多雨缺，冷多于热，严重的伤害了各种农产作物。广平四区麦子冻死不少，二、三、四区菜籽花亦遭冻毁。肥乡已至种棉时节，如再不下雨，棉花点种困难。三地委对此情况十分重视，现一面向上报告；一面直接派人下乡勘察，并电催各县迅速指派专人，亲到灾区，详细了解情况，深入征询群众对冻死冻毁之各种作物的抢救办法，拟组织大力向新灾做坚决斗争。  （柳塘）
