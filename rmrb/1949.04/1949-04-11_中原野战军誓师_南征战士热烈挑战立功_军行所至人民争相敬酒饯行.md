　　Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains Front, 10th: The various units of the Second Field Army of the Central Plains People's Liberation Army solemnly held mobilization rallies for the crossing of the Yangtze River and the southern advance. All commanders and fighters took the following oath: "We are glorious People's Liberation Army soldiers, vowing under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao to carry the revolution through to the end, advance into the South, realize true peace, and liberate all of China." At the oath-taking rally of the Field Army's directly subordinate units, Field Army Chief of Staff General Li Da said: "The 200 million people of the South are looking forward to us day and night, we must quickly go and save them." He then called on all commanders and fighters to overcome all difficulties, victoriously complete the advance mission, and conscientiously implement the Three Main Rules of Discipline and the Eight Points for Attention. After entering the big cities, maintain the hardworking and simple style of the working people and not be dazzled by the colorful world. At a mobilization rally of a certain army, Corps Deputy Commander General Guo Tianmin called on the entire army to highly promote revolutionary heroism in the great advance and strive for the first meritorious service in crossing the river. Yu Hongyuan, director of the political department of the army, representing the CPC Army Committee, called on everyone to cross the river victoriously, further regularize the army, correctly implement the urban policy and the new district policy, unite officers and soldiers, and study hard. The mobilization rallies in various departments were filled with enthusiastic and vigorous emotions. The venues were filled with various American-made weapons, and the surroundings were plastered with the southern advance requests and merit-seeking challenge letters from various units and soldiers, as well as clear and simple large-character slogans. Banners such as "Achieve Meritorious Service in the South" and "Million-Strong Army Advances South," and large flags pasted with southern advance determination letters, shone in the sun. Representatives of local people's governments and residents also participated in the rallies. At a rally of a certain division, local residents competed to offer wine to the heroes of the troops. Combat hero Fang Zhengyi took the wine and said: "After drinking your first cup of wine, I will resolutely go south to repay your kindness; the second cup is for liberating all of China; the third cup is for fearing no sacrifice and carrying the revolution through to the end!" His words immediately aroused the triumphant cry of "Advance to the South to Liberate All of China!" throughout the venue.
