Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 5th: The Changtaiguan Huaihe River Railway Bridge on the Pinghan Railway, which is crucial for north-south transportation, has been completely destroyed by the Kuomintang bandit troops, with only two spans remaining at the northern end of the bridge. The Huaihe River Railway Bridge is located near Changtaiguan, north of Xinyang, and is one of the major engineering projects of the Pinghan Railway. As early as February 12th of this year, the puppet Ministry of National Defense and war criminal Bai Chongxi secretly ordered the engineering regiment stationed in Wuhan to carry a large amount of explosives to the Xinyang area, preparing to cooperate with Zhang Zhen, commander of the puppet Fifth Pacification Zone, to destroy the Huaihe River Railway Bridge and the large tunnel at Wusheng Pass, south of Xinyang, when the bandit troops withdrew. The Central Plains Military Region of the People's Liberation Army issued a serious warning to the puppet Ministry of National Defense, Bai Chongxi, Zhang Zhen, etc., stating that if they dared to implement this criminal plan, they would be arrested and severely punished. However, the puppet Ministry of National Defense and Bai Chongxi, etc., disregarded the warning of the People's Liberation Army and brazenly destroyed the Huaihe River Railway Bridge, an important construction project of China, during the peace negotiations. It is also reliably learned that the White bandits plan to blow up the Zhanggong Dyke on the Hanshui River west of Hankou and the outer dike of Shashi when the People's Liberation Army liberates Hankou and Shashi, flooding Hankou and Shashi, turning the two cities into a watery grave, and causing millions of citizens and the People's Liberation Army to suffer the disaster of extinction. The destruction of the Huaihe River Railway Bridge, this counter-revolutionary act of sabotaging national construction and the people's property, seriously violates the order issued by the General Headquarters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army to punish war criminals; and the conspiracy to blow up the dikes and flood Hankou and Shashi is even more insane and inhumane. This criminal action and the huge conspiracy being planned, along with the massacre of patriotic students in Nanjing who demanded genuine peace and the bombing of the Chongqing cruiser that revolted and joined the People's Liberation Army, are all serious provocations by the Kuomintang reactionaries against the Chinese people and the People's Liberation Army during this period. Although Li Zongren, He Yingqin, Bai Chongxi and others have sent delegations to Beiping for peace talks and released information requesting lenient treatment for war criminals, their actions show that they not only lack sincerity for peace and have no remorse, but also do not want to atone for their crimes and gain the understanding and forgiveness of the people. Instead, they are determined to use the peace talks as a cover to continue their rampant atrocities, continue to accumulate sins on top of their already countless crimes, and alienate themselves from the people. The treacherous and sinister Gui系 warlord leaders Bai Chongxi and his ilk attempt to use the destruction of the Huaihe River Bridge and the preparation to flood Hankou and Shashi to prevent the advance of the People's Liberation Army, but historical facts have long shown that any resistance, sabotage, and conspiracies cannot stop the victorious development of the People's Liberation War. All the crimes and conspiracies of the war criminals only tell the People's Liberation Army that it should quickly cross the Yangtze River and advance south to liberate all of China, capture the war criminals alive as soon as possible, so that the patriotic people of the south of the Yangtze River will no longer be slaughtered, the country's construction and resources will suffer less damage, and their new, heinous conspiracies cannot be realized.

　　反动派严重挑衅自绝国人
  　白匪借和谈掩护恣意横行      
    悍然炸毁淮河铁桥
  　解放军应迅速渡江活捉战犯
    【新华社北平五日电】关系南北交通的平汉铁路长台关淮河大铁桥，已被国民党匪军彻底炸毁，全桥仅残剩北头两孔。淮河铁桥在信阳以北长台关附近，是平汉铁路的巨大工程之一。在今年二月十二日，伪国防部和战犯白崇禧即密令驻武汉的工兵团，携带大批炸药至信阳地区，准备在匪军撤退时，协同伪第五绥区司令张轸，将淮河铁桥和信阳以南武胜关的大隧道炸毁。人民解放军中原军区为此曾向伪国防部和白崇禧、张轸等提出严重警告，如胆敢实行这一罪恶计划，必将缉捕归案，严厉惩办。但是伪国防部和白崇禧等竟不顾解放军的警告，在和平谈判之际，悍然将中国的重要建设淮河铁桥炸毁。又据确息，白匪计划在人民解放军解放汉口沙市时，炸毁汉口西面汉水上的张公堤和沙市外堤，水淹汉口沙市，使两市成为泽国，使数百万市民和人民解放军同遭灭顶之灾。炸毁淮河铁桥，这一破坏国家建设和人民财产的反革命行为，严重地触犯了中国人民解放军总部所颁布的惩处战争罪犯的命令；而准备炸毁堤坝，水淹汉口沙市的阴谋，更属丧心病狂，灭绝人性。这一犯罪行动和正在策划的巨大阴谋，与屠杀南京要求真和平的爱国学生及炸毁起义参加解放军的重庆号巡洋舰，同为这一时期国民党反动派对于中国人民和人民解放军的严重挑衅。尽管李宗仁，何应钦、白崇禧辈派出代表团来北平进行和谈，并放出空气要求对战争罪犯从宽发落，但他们的所作所为，却表明他们不但缺乏和平诚意，毫无悔过之心，不想立功自赎，取得人民的谅解和宽恕，而且决心借和谈为掩护，恣意横行到底，在已经难以计数的罪孽上继续积累罪孽，自绝于国人。阴贼险狠的桂系军阀首领白崇禧辈企图以炸毁淮河大桥和准备水淹汉口、沙市来阻止人民解放军的前进，但历史事实早已昭示，任何抵抗、破坏和阴谋诡计是绝对阻止不了人民解放战争的胜利发展的。战犯们的一切罪行和阴谋，只是告诉人民解放军，应该迅速地渡江南进，解放全中国，把战犯们早日活捉归案，以免江南爱国人民再受屠戮，国家的建设和资材少受破坏，并使其新的罪恶滔天的阴谋无法实现。
