Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, April 13th: Budapest Dispatch: The Central Leadership Organ of the Hungarian Working People's Party held a plenary meeting here and listened to the political situation report by General Secretary Rakosi and the new Five-Year Plan report by Vida, Chairman of the Hungarian National Planning Bureau. The meeting adopted Rakosi's report and his proposals, and approved the draft Five-Year Plan for the development of the Hungarian national economy proposed in Vida's report. The plenary session resolution pointed out that judging from the current achievements, Hungary's Three-Year Plan will undoubtedly be fully completed by the end of 1949, that is, nine months ahead of schedule, and even more in some departments. In the past three years, Hungary has become a country of the working class and the laboring peasants, that is, a country of the laboring people. State power is in the hands of the working class. The allies of the working class are the laboring people. The Three-Year Plan has created the necessary conditions to continue and complete the construction of the foundation of socialism, not only in the cities but also in the countryside. The new Five-Year Plan stipulates the acceleration of the country's industrialization, especially the development of heavy industry and machine manufacturing. The completion of the new Five-Year Plan will enable the socialist economy to occupy a dominant position in the entire national economy. To achieve these goals, 35 billion Hungarian forints will be invested in the national economy in the next five years. By 1954, the national income will increase by 160% compared to 1949. The plenary session resolution emphasized that it is necessary to eliminate the backwardness of the Hungarian countryside, improve agricultural productivity, mechanize agriculture, and develop animal husbandry. This will create the necessary conditions for transforming the scattered small-scale peasant system into a modern and advantageous large-scale agricultural system, ensuring that the people can live a prosperous and cultured life. The implementation of the Five-Year Plan will raise the living standards of the Hungarian working people by 15% compared to 1948. The plan also stipulates the construction of many hospitals, sanatoriums, maternity hospitals, etc. Large sums of money will be used to develop national education, train workers, staff, and scientific and cultural facilities. The plenary session resolution stated: The Five-Year Plan is the road to building a socialist Hungary.

Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, April 13th: TASS Budapest Dispatch: The Hungarian Council of Ministers discussed the resolution passed on April 6th by the Presidium of the People's Independent Front, namely the People's Independent Front requested the government to recommend to the President to dissolve the parliament and set a date for new elections.

　　保证走向社会主义
    匈拟定新五年计划
  　三年计划将于本年底提前完成
    【新华社北平十三日电】布达佩斯讯：匈牙利劳动人民党中央领导机关在此间举行的全体会议听取了总书记拉科西的政治形势报告和匈牙利国家计划局主席维达的新五年计划报告。会议通过了拉科西的报告及其所提建议，并标准了维达报告中提出的发展匈牙利国民经济五年计划草案，全会决议指出由目前的成绩判断，匈牙利的三年计划，无疑地将在一九四九年底全部完成，也就是较规定时间提前九个月，而在某些部门甚至还要多些。在近三年的过程中，匈牙利已经成为工人阶级和劳动农民的国家，也就是劳动人民的国家。国家政权掌握在工人阶级的手里。工人阶级的同盟者就是劳动人民。三年计划已经创造了必要条件，可以继续并完成社会主义基础的建设。不但在城市，即在乡间也是如此。新的五年计划规定要加速国家的工业化，首先是发展重工业与机器制造业。新五年计划的完成，将使社会主义经济在整个国民经济中占支配地位。为了达到这些目的，今后五年内投入国民经济的资金将为三百五十亿匈币。到一九五四年国民收入将比一九四九年增加百分之一百六十。全会决议着重指出必须消除匈牙利乡村的落后性，提高农业生产力，使农业机械化，并发展牧畜业。这样就可以创造必要条件，使分散的小农制度变为现代的、有利的大规模农业制度，保证人民能过上富裕而有文化的生活。五年计划的实现将使匈牙利劳动人民的生活水准比一九四八年提高百分之十五。计划并规定要建筑许多医院、疗养院、产科医院等。大宗款项将用于发展国民教育，训练工人、职员以及科学与文化设施。全会决议说：五年计划就是走向建设社会主义匈牙利的大路。
    【新华社北平十三日电】塔斯社布达佩斯讯：匈牙利部长会议讨论人民独立阵线主席团四月六日通过的决议，该决议即人民独立阵线请求政府向总统建议解散议会和规定日期举行新的选举。部长会议通过了人民独立阵线主席团的建议，并请求总统解散议会。
