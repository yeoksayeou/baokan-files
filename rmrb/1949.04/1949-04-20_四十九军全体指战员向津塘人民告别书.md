To the fellow compatriots of all circles in Tianjin and Tanggu:

    Recently, the industrial, commercial, academic, women's, and other mass organizations in Tianjin initiated a large-scale consolation and farewell movement. Every citizen, from rickshaw pullers to factory workers, especially the factory workers and school students, enthusiastically participated in this movement, presenting flags, flowers, and letters, and holding labor-consolation and farewell rallies, everywhere filled with boundless enthusiasm, giving us spiritual and material encouragement. We extend our deepest gratitude to all the citizens!

    Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, the People's Liberation Army has always stood with the Chinese people, striving for the cause of the liberation of the Chinese people. Now, in order to liberate the 200 million people south of the Yangtze River and thoroughly overthrow the rule of the reactionaries, we are ordered to march south of the Yangtze River. We are determined to complete this glorious and great task with staunch combat actions.

    It has been nearly three months since the liberation of Tianjin. Our army was ordered to assume the task of garrisoning the city. Thanks to the efforts and support of people from all walks of life, the city's order has been rapidly restored and developed. However, due to the increase of new elements in the troops and insufficient education, the garrisoning was not meticulous and in-depth enough, and the order in the city was not yet perfect. Furthermore, there were phenomena of some troop personnel violating discipline. We sincerely accept everyone's criticisms and guidance so that we can better serve the people.

    Farewell to all the citizens of Tianjin and Tanggu!

    Sincerely,
    All officers and soldiers of the Fourth Field Army, Forty-Ninth Army of the Chinese People's Liberation Army

    四十九军全体指战员向津塘人民告别书天津塘沽的各界同胞们：
    最近天津市工商学妇女及各界群众团体，发起了盛大规模的慰劳欢送运动，每个市民以至三轮车夫，尤其是工厂工友们，学校的学生们，都热烈的参加这一运动，献旗、献花、写信，举行劳军欢送大会，到处充满了无限的热情，给我们以精神上和物质上的鼓励，谨向全体市民深致感谢！
    人民解放军在中国共产党和毛主席朱总司令领导之下，始终和中国人民站在一起，为中国人民的解放事业而奋斗，现在为了解放长江以南二万万人民，沏底推翻反动派的统治，我们奉命向长江以南进军，我们决以顽强的战斗行动，完成这一光荣伟大的任务。
    天津解放近三个月，本军奉命曙任警备，承各界民众努力支持，使城市秩序迅速恢复和发展，但由于部队中新成份增加，教育不够，以至警备不够细致深入，市内秩序未尽完善，并某些部队人员破坏纪律的现象发生，我们当诚恳的接受大家的批评和指导，使我们能更好的为人民服务。
    谨向天津塘沽全体市民告别！
    中国人解放军第四十九军全体指战员谨启
