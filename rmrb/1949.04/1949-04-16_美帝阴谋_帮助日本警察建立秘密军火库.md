　　US Imperialist Conspiracy
  　Helping Japanese Police Establish Secret Armories
    Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, April 14th: According to reliable sources, MacArthur Headquarters in Japan has established multiple secret armories for the Japanese police. This reactionary step to re-arm Japan was decided upon by the former Undersecretary of the US Army, Mr. Draper, during his visit to Japan last spring. In view of the growing sentiment among the Japanese people against American aggression and demanding democratic reforms, Draper conferred with MacArthur, and they agreed that MacArthur Headquarters and the Japanese government would jointly establish secret armories for the Japanese police, so that the Japanese police would have sufficient armed forces to suppress the struggles of the Japanese people. MacArthur has accordingly instructed his chief of staff to work with the Japanese government to establish these armories nationwide. It is reported that the former Nakajima Aircraft Company's warehouses are among the many secret warehouses storing large quantities of weapons and military supplies. This measure by the American occupiers, which once again violates the Potsdam Declaration, indicates that the American aggressors' plan to conquer the Japanese people is encountering serious difficulties. Although the American government is trying to use Japan as a Far Eastern base for launching new wars of aggression, the Japanese people are determined not to serve as tools of American imperialism.

　　美帝阴谋
  　帮助日本警察建立秘密军火库
    【新华社北平十四日电】据可靠消息，日本的麦克阿瑟总部已为日本警察建立秘密军火库多处。此一从新武装日本的反动步骤，系前美国陆军部次长德莱柏在去年春季访日时所决定。德莱柏鉴于日本人民反抗美国侵略和要求民主改革的情绪的增长，曾与麦克阿瑟商定，由麦克阿瑟总部与日本政府合作为日本警察建立秘密的军火库，以便日本警察有充分的武装力量来镇压日本人民的斗争。麦克阿瑟已据此授命其参谋长与日本政府着手在全国建立此项军火库。据悉，前日本中昔飞机公司的仓库就是这种储藏大批武器与军用物资的许多秘密仓库之一。美国占领者此项又一次违背了茨坦公告的措施，表示美国侵略者征服日本人民的计划正在遭遇严重困难。尽管美国政府力图把日本当作发动新的侵略战争的远东基地，日本人民却决不愿意充当美国帝国主义的工具。
