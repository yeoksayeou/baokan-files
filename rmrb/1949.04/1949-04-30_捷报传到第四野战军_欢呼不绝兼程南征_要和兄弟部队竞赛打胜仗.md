Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 27th: As the good news of crossing the Yangtze River and liberating Nanjing continuously reached the Fourth Field Army on their march, cheers resounded along the way. Every soldier and officer was advancing rapidly with an impatient heart. Chen Zhihong, a soldier of the "Tower Hill Hero Regiment," said: "Our hearts are burning like fire. We can't wait to sprout wings and fly across the Yangtze River to compete with our brother units in winning a great victory!" Many soldiers immediately made plans to perform meritorious deeds during the crossing. Soldiers with blisters on their feet were excitedly keeping up with the ranks. They gritted their teeth and said, "I'll crawl to the south of the Yangtze River if I have to." Soldiers passing through their hometowns changed their minds about going home to visit. They said: "Crossing the river is the priority. It's not too late to go home after the victory." Many soldiers quickly composed new clappers and ditties, and the broadcasting stations in the squads became even more active, spreading news of victories and praising models. Every rank was extremely lively. The officers and soldiers of the units about to depart are now even more anxious. After a certain unit received the marching order, it received eleven "Southward Expedition Resolution Letters" in a quarter of an hour. Machine gunner Yin Zuofu received three letters from home asking him to come back and get married. He said: "Carrying out Chairman Mao's orders is the priority. It will be even more glorious to come back and get married after making a meritorious contribution!"

　　捷报传到第四野战军
  　欢呼不绝兼程南征
  　要和兄弟部队竞赛打胜仗
    【新华社北平二十七日电】打过长江，解放南京的捷报接连传到征途中的第四野战军时，沿途欢呼不绝，每个指战员都以急不可待的心情迅速前进。“塔山英雄团”的战士陈志红说：“我们的心象火烧一样，恨不得马上插上翅膀飞过江南，和兄弟部队竞赛打个胜仗！”许多战士立刻订立渡江立功的计划。脚上打起了泡的战士，都兴奋地紧紧跟着行列前进。他们咬着牙说，我爬也要爬到江南去，路过家乡的战士们都改变了回家探望的念头，他们说：过江要紧，胜利了再回来看家不迟。许多战士们都很快编出许多新的快板小调，班里的广播台更加活跃起来，传播着各种胜利和表扬模范的消息，每个行列都热闹异常。正待出发的部队的指战员现在是更加焦急了。某部接到进军令后，一刻钟之间收到了十一封“南征决心书”。机枪射手尹佐福接到三封要他回去娶亲的家信。他说：“执行毛主席的命令要紧，立功回来娶亲更光荣！”
