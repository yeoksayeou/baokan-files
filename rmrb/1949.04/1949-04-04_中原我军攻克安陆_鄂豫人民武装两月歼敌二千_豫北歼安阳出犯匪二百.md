　　Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 3rd: The People's Liberation Army recovered Anlu County, more than 100 li northwest of Hankou, on the 26th of last month, and completely annihilated the county's puppet security brigade of more than 400 people at Wangjiadian, a railway station on the Pinghan Road east of Anlu City, on the 31st.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 3rd: Since the great victory of the Huaihai Campaign, the people's armed forces in the Hubei-Henan Liberated Area have actively carried out military suppression and political offensives against the remaining enemies in various places, and have achieved successive victories. According to incomplete statistics, since the end of January, the area has eliminated a total of more than 2,300 enemy local teams and bandit armed forces in two months, and seized more than 50 machine guns and more than 1,700 long and short guns, and successively liberated five county towns including Macheng, Huangchuan, Guangshan, Luotian, and Yingshan. Because the area correctly implemented the policy of "the ringleaders must be punished, the coerced will not be questioned, and those who perform meritorious service will be rewarded" against the enemy, it accelerated the disintegration of the enemy. On January 30th and 31st, the puppet Guangshan and Huangchuan county governments and five security squadrons in Huangchuan surrendered one after another. On February 1st, bandit Fu Molin of Gushi County led more than 100 of his men to surrender. In Shangcheng County alone, more than 1,200 bandits have returned in the past two months.
　　Taihang Telegram: The bandit troops of Chen Dazeng and Liu Lexian, and the 4th Supervisory Battalion of bandits, a total of more than 2,000 people, who were besieged by our liberating army on the isolated island of Anyang, attacked Dahan Village southwest of Anyang City at dawn on the 27th of last month in an attempt to seize food. After receiving the information, our Qihe Detachment rushed to the scene at 10:00 a.m. and gave the enemy a head-on blow. After two and a half hours of fighting, we captured Su Nanqing, the first battalion commander of the 5th Regiment of the 3rd Brigade of the Ji-Yu Bandit Suppression Command, and Xue Yongtian and Li Yutian, the first and third company commanders, and more than 200 others, killing 83 enemies and wounding 20. We seized 18 light and heavy machine guns, 134 rifles, 1 pistol, more than 10,000 rounds of ammunition, more than 10 incendiary bombs, more than 100 grenades, 3 war horses, 3 bugles, and a part of other military supplies.
