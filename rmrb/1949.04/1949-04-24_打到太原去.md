　　March to Taiyuan!
    Comrade Li Zhimin, Director of the Political Department of the Corps, said:
    “This time, we are marching towards the final victory in North China!”
    Our unit has fought in Suiyuan and various parts of North China, and countless heroes and models emerged during the liberation of Baotou and Zhangjiakou. This time, in this last major annihilation battle in North China, who would be willing to lag behind?
    In the past few days, soldiers and soldiers, squads and squads, platoons and platoons... battalions, regiments, and battalions, regiments, between each other, have launched fierce challenges and competitions.
    Each unit, with Communist Party members as the core, has organized "fortress groups." They guarantee that no comrades in their unit will fall behind, and they also help other units. The third platoon of the third machine gun company of a certain unit has challenged the entire regiment, and everyone's heart is united—to be a hero in the advance!
    On March 12, 1949, we set off from the outskirts of Peiping.

　　March 12th
    When the advance bugle sounded, the sky was still twinkling with stars. The instructor gave a simple speech in front of the team: "We are about to set off now, to fight Taiyuan! Our previous plans will be tested in actual action from now on. I believe that every comrade is a hero who can speak and act!" The soldiers were all in high spirits, and their breathing became rapid.
    After walking twenty li, the sun had just shown half of its red face in the east. Everyone happily cheered and marched. If you haven't been to the company, you probably can't imagine how high the morale of the soldiers is today. Wu Huinian, a meritorious hero, painstakingly came up with many motivational words to help others. He said to An Zhigui, a seventeen-year-old soldier who had been liberated from Zhangjiakou: "Comrade, you are really wrong. We should look far ahead. Now I will carry your gun to the mountain ahead for you, you rest for a while, so that you won't collapse from exhaustion and can persevere forever. This is good for our squad and our company. If you don't let mutual assistance collapse, then our model squad and model company will be finished." But this seventeen-year-old soldier put on a "statesman" face and said seriously: "You don't understand at all, my marching ability is very strong. Besides, you want to be a model, doesn't anyone else want to be a model?" "Okay, then I'll challenge you!" "Challenge, let's challenge to the end!" The two turned mutual assistance into a challenge. Communist Party member Luo Yuyou came up with a clever method, he secretly organized a "flying squad" to carry out mutual assistance. That is, seeing who is tired, he quietly runs up from behind and suddenly snatches his things. If this person wants to snatch it back, he throws it to the second person. Everyone knows that the new soldier Hu Shangxian, today he twisted a "Yangko" dance, not far out, his two feet, one foot palm had two big blisters, but he refused to let others help, leaning on a stick, hobbling along with his heel, and constantly singing Shanxi opera. When people asked him, he said: "I'm dancing the Yangko dance!"

　　March 14th
    This is also the old rule of marching, the first few days are always more tiring. When we walked into the camp, our legs were almost too bent to straighten.
    The fifth and sixth squads lived in the easternmost house. As soon as everyone entered the yard, they felt a kind of warmth. Two middle-aged women and several children in their teens were busy leading everyone:
    "This room, this room! The water has been boiled long ago, have a bowl!"
    The room was cleaned spotlessly, and an old woman with all her teeth missing sat on the kang, pursing her mouth, holding a little fat boy in her arms. As soon as she saw us come in, the wrinkles on her face all bloomed with a smile, and she said to the child: "Hurry up and welcome them, call them uncles." The child opened two small white hands, nodding and clapping his hands while saying "Ah, ah!", causing everyone to burst into laughter, and most of the day's fatigue was lost.
    After a while, her son came back, wearing a half-new blue cotton coat. He said his name was Pan Zuotong. The squad leader asked him to buy some eggs for the sick, and he readily agreed: "Okay," and ran out after speaking. After a while, he brought back four, and asked: "Do you need noodles?" The squad leader gave him money, and he said: "Give it to whom? These are all given to the sick by the villagers, and the village office has a lot more in stock!"
    In the evening, the squad invited him over and held a discussion meeting together. He said:
    "Half a month ago, our district chief came and said that our troops would pass through here. The people were so happy to hear it, and they all said: 'Last time they passed through here, they won a great victory, liberated Suiyuan and Zhangjiakou, and then liberated Peiping; this time they pass through here, they will fight Taiyuan and go south, and it looks like the whole country will be victorious!' Everyone prepared supplies day and night, grain, firewood, grass, everything. Comrades! You don't know, since the district chief mentioned the troops that day, we have been waiting all day long. After ten days or so, we didn't see them coming, and people were anxious. Whenever they had time, they grabbed the wall and looked north. Yesterday, more than a dozen people came down from the mountain, all on foot. I said: 'These are the advance scouts, the troops are coming soon.' Sure enough, they stopped here. Everyone got busy, those who were preparing rice, those who were setting up stoves.
    Comrades! This is also two good things in exchange for one! That year (1943), a great flood came down from the mountain and washed away the river beach. People were all eating tree bark and grass roots, their faces were yellow and green from starvation. The government found out and the county chief and commissioner came to our village in person. At that time, money was useful, and the government took millions to dredge the river beach again. The government also went to Yu County and Xing Tang to get rice seeds and distribute them to us, and the villagers came back to life! Comrades, even if we were asked to take out our hearts and give them to the Eighth Route Army to eat, people would be willing, the Eighth Route Army has the grace to save our lives!"
    Everyone listened so attentively that they even forgot to wash their feet, especially the new comrades were most moved. Wang Shikui said: "No wonder the Eighth Route Army wins battles, the Eighth Route Army has taken root in the hearts of the people!" Yan Mingxi said: "In the past, in the reactionary army, people everywhere pointed at my spine and cursed, today I see that the villagers are so good to us, I feel that being a soldier of the People's Liberation Army is really glorious!"

### 打到太原去

　　打到太原去
    徐孔
    向太原进军！
    兵团政治部主任李志民同志说：
    “这一回是走向华北最后的胜利！”
    我们这支队伍曾经转战绥远和华北各地，在解放包头、张家口的时候，曾出现了无数的英雄模范。这一回，在这华北最后的仅有的一次大会歼战里，谁肯走在别人的后边？
    几天来，战士与战士、班与班、排与排……营、团与营、团之间，展开了炽烈的挑战竞赛。
    各个单位，以共产党员为核心，全组织起“堡垒小组”他们保证不让本单位的同志掉队，并且帮助别的单位。×部三机连的第三排向全团立擂（挑战），人们的心都是一致的——作前进中的英雄！
    一九四九年三月十二日，我们由平郊出发了。
　　三月十二日
    吹前进号的时候，天空还闪着星星。指导员在队前简单的说了几句：“我们现在就要出发了，打太原去！我们从前的计划，从现在起就要在实际行动里考验。我相信，每个同志都是能说能作的英雄汉！”战士们个个精神抖擞，呼吸也紧促起来。
    走了二十里路，太阳刚刚在东边露出半块红脸，大家都高兴地欢呼着行进，如果没有到过连队的人，也许想象不出今天战士们的情绪是怎样的高涨。大功功臣吴惠年为了帮助别人，苦心的想出许多动员话来，他和张家口解放过来的十七岁的小战士安直贵说：“同志，你实在不对，咱们应该往远处看，现在我替你把枪背到前边的山头上，你稍休息一下，这样你累不垮，就能以永远坚持下去，这对咱们班咱们连全有好处。如果你不让互助累垮了，咱们的模范班模范连也就完蛋了。”可是这个十七岁的小战士却摆起一付“政治家”的面扎，严肃的说：“你根本不了解，我的行军力可强哩。再说，你想作模范，人家就不想作模范呀？”“好，那我挑你的战啦！”“挑，咱们挑到底！”两个人把互助变成挑战。共产党员罗玉有想出一个巧妙的办法，他在暗中组织一个“飞行小组”，进行互助。就是看谁累了，他就悄悄的从后边跑上去，猛的夺下他的东西来，如果这个人想往回夺，他就扔给第二个。谁都知道新战士胡尚先，今天扭了一道“秧歌”，走出不远，他两只脚，一只脚掌打了两个大泡，可是他却不肯叫别人互助，拄着棍子，一拐一拐的用脚跟走，嘴里还不住的唱着山西梆子。人家问他，他说：“我这是跳秧歌舞哩！”
　　三月十四日
    这也是行军的老规律，前几天总是累一些。我们走进宿营地的时候，两条腿，简直有些打不过弯来了。
    五、六班住在最东头的一家。大家一进院就感到一种亲热劲儿，两个中年大嫂还有几个十多岁的小孩子忙着带领大家：
    “这屋这屋！水早烧开了，喝碗吧！”
    屋里打扫得干干净净，炕上坐着一个老大娘牙都掉光了，扁扁着嘴，怀里抱着一个小胖孩。一见我们进来，满脸的皱纹都笑开花了，对着小孩说：“快欢迎欢迎，叫叔叔。”这个小孩张开两只小白手一边点头，一边“啊啊！”的拍起手来，惹得大家哄的一声笑起来，一天的疲劳也就丢了大半。
    一会，她儿子回来了，穿着半新的蓝棉袄，他说他叫潘作通，班长求他给病号买些鸡蛋，他满口答应：“好，”说完就跑出去了，一会拿回四个来，还问：“要不要挂面？”班长给他钱，他说：“给谁呀？这都是老乡们自动送给病号吃的，村公所存的还多哩！”
    晚上，班里把他请过来，一块开了个座谈会。他说：
    “头半月咱们区长就来了，说咱们队伍要过这里，老百姓一听可喜欢坏了，都说：‘上回从这过打了大胜仗，解放了绥远、张家口，后来又解放北平；这回从这过又要打太原、南下，眼看就要全国胜利呀！’大家白天黑夜的筹备给养，你说粮、柴、草，什么也有。同志！你们不知道，自从那天区长一说过队伍，咱们就整天的盼，一连十来天不见来，人们都急坏了，有空就抓着墙头往北看。昨天，山上下来了十多个人，全是步行。我说：‘这是打前站的，队伍可快来了。’果不然到这里就停下了。大伙都忙起来了，弄米的弄米，安锅的安锅。
    同志！这也是两好换一好啊！那一年（一九四三年），山上下来大水，把河滩都给拉了。人们全吃树皮、草根，脸饿的黄里透青。政府里知道了，县长、专员亲自到俺村来，那工夫钱顶用，政府里拿了好几百万，河滩又淤起来了。政府又到蔚县和行唐去弄的稻子种发给俺们，这村子人又活过来了！同志，就是叫俺们把心掏出来给八路军吃，人们也愿意，八路军对我们有活命之恩哪！”
    大家听得连洗脚也忘掉了，尤其新同志受感动最大。王世奎说：“怨不得八路军打胜仗，八路军在老百姓的心里长了根了！”阎明喜说：“过去在反动派军队里，到处叫人指着脊梁骨骂，今天看到老乡对我们这样好，我觉着当个解放军的战士实在是光荣！”
