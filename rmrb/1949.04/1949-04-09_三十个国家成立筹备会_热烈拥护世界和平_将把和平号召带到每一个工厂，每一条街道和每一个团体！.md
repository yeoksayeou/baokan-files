Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 7th: Reports from various sources indicate that people of all nations, political persuasions, and religious beliefs are increasingly supporting the World Congress for the Defense of Peace. Groups representing 550 million people have already announced their willingness to participate in the Congress. Preparatory committees in thirty countries are conducting extensive activities.

The National Congress for the Defense of Peace in Bulgaria has concluded in Sofia. The Congress unanimously passed a resolution condemning the instigators of new wars, the initiators of aggressive pacts, and the enemies of democracy, culture, and progress; expressing welcome and support for the convening of the World Congress for the Defense of Peace, and electing representatives to attend the Paris Congress.

Many towns in Czechoslovakia are holding rallies in support of peace. Last week, in the Bardubice district alone, 730 towns and cities held rallies in support of peace. The Women's League and the Youth League have respectively mobilized 2.5 million and 350,000 people to sign declarations in support of peace. The Czechoslovak delegation to the World Congress for the Defense of Peace will consist of 77 members, led by National Assembly Vice-Chairman Spurna.

Indonesian overseas youth representative Sukiono, representing Indonesian youth groups resisting imperialist aggression, sent a telegram to the Preparatory Committee of the World Congress for the Defense of Peace, stating: "We Indonesian youth, together with the people, are conducting an armed struggle against the Dutch aggressors supported by American and British imperialism. We fully support and respond to the convening of the World Peace Congress. As frontline fighters striving for peace and democracy through national liberation struggles, we hope the Peace Congress will be a great success."

The movement to strive for peace and oppose the war actions of American and British imperialism is developing throughout Britain. Last weekend, peace demonstrations were held in Steiney, a working-class district of London, and in Manchester and Liverpool. Mothers in Steiney placed their children in prams with slogans attached, reading: "Cut arms, not meat," "The North Atlantic Pact is a war pact," and "Friendship with the Soviet Union." At the 5th Congress of the Yorkshire Communist Party held in Leeds, delegates pledged to bring the message of peace to every factory, every street, and every group in Yorkshire. The meeting decided to hold grand demonstrations in Sheffield, Leeds, Bradford, and Hull in Yorkshire. Shop stewards at the Rosyth Dockyard (in the Firth of Forth) in Scotland decided to send two representatives to the Paris Congress. The Scottish delegation also includes representatives from the Scottish area of the National Union of Mineworkers and representatives from the Annbank and Sancothill mines. The first British trade union to support the Paris Congress was the Foundry Workers' Union, whose president, McGorr, will represent 80,000 members at the Congress.

Sweden has established a preparatory committee to participate in the World Congress for the Defense of Peace. The committee issued a letter to progressive citizens, democratic groups, and trade unions throughout the country, urging them to support peace and send representatives of the progressive public to the Congress.

Mrs. Brunfaut, secretary of the Belgian Women's League, said at the Belgian Women's Peace Congress: "Belgian women will oppose warmongers and all those who create war." She expressed support for the World Congress for the Defense of Peace. The Belgian League of Pensioners also expressed the same sentiment.

The first Brazilian Congress for the Defense of Peace will be held on the 8th in the capital, Rio de Janeiro. The preparatory committee of the Congress issued a declaration, calling on the people of the country to participate in the struggle to defend peace and oppose the adventurers of war.

Dada, a spokesman for the Transvaal branch of the South African Indian Congress, wrote to the Preparatory Committee of the World Congress for the Defense of Peace in Paris, saying: "We people of color, the peace-loving people of South Africa, welcome the World Peace Congress and believe that it is a powerful weapon in the struggle against warmongers, racists, and fascists. The war preparations carried out by colonial countries mean cruel exploitation for us nine million oppressed colored residents of South Africa."
