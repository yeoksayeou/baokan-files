The enemies of the working class erupted in a frenzy of celebration after the British and American labor traitors broke away from the World Federation of Trade Unions (WFTU). The reactionary newspapers hailed these splitters as heroes; Deakin, Carey, and Kupers became instant darlings. Reactionary commentators "gleefully" announced the demise of the WFTU. For instance, "The Economist," a journal closely linked to big capitalists in the City of London (London's economic center, equivalent to New York's Wall Street—translator's note), wrote:

“After the withdrawal of the British, American, and Dutch representatives, the World Federation of Trade Unions can no longer even pretend to be a genuine international trade union.”

"Le Monde," the Parisian newspaper closely associated with big capital, declared in the same vein: "The World Federation of Trade Unions has now lost its title of ‘World’ alliance and the universality of the trade union's total power."

However, subsequent facts and developments have demonstrated how baseless the predictions of the reactionaries, who desired to realize their wishes, were. The WFTU, after the desertion of Deakin, Carey, and Kupers, remains a world alliance, just as the French General Confederation of Labor (CGT) after the departure of Jouhaux and his "workers' force" partners remains the French General Confederation of Labor. Naturally, the WFTU has suffered damage from these splitters. But the workers of Britain, America, and the Netherlands suffered the most due to this unjust act and the attempt to force them to break away from the progressive international trade union movement. The protests in Britain, America, and the Netherlands against this move fully demonstrate that the grassroots trade unionists are alert to the dangers lurking within. The idea of realizing international solidarity and cooperation within the WFTU is deeply imprinted in the minds of millions of working people.

The representatives of the British Trades Union Congress (TUC) and the American Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) wanted to disrupt the ranks of the WFTU supporters by withdrawing from the WFTU, leading to its failure. But those who instigated the split clearly lost their sense of reality. They neglected or failed to recognize the profound changes within the WFTU and the trade union ranks.

Since the withdrawal of the Anglo-American bloc representatives, the resolutions of the WFTU's executive bodies have repeatedly emphasized that the era in which the trade unions of two or three countries could completely control and direct the fate of the international trade union movement has definitively ended with the Second World War. Trade unions in many countries have become mass organizations and play a significant role in national life. They very rightly reject discriminatory intentions in international affairs. There are no fundamental differences between the trade unions of various countries that might prevent them from working together to ensure the common interests of the working people. This became even clearer after the Paris conference. Differences of opinion on individual issues do not preclude the possibility of cooperation within an international organization, but it was precisely the lack of this desire on the part of the British and American representatives. This fact could not be concealed by them at the most recent meeting of the Executive Bureau. In order to justify themselves, Deakin, Carey, and Kupers made grand pronouncements such as "Soviet trade unions want to control the WFTU," "Communist trade unions are plotting conspiracies," and so on.

Trade unions are not party organizations, and this is the view of Soviet workers, which they firmly adhere to in their relations with other countries' trade unions. But the fact is that some trade union leaders eagerly defend the interests of the working class, while others do not. Deakin, Carey, and Kupers actually share the views of certain elements who fear closer cooperation among trade unions in the struggle for higher wages and better working conditions, against fascism and war, and for a genuine, consolidated, and lasting peace.

Needless to say, this is not the view of the workers of Britain, America, and the Netherlands, but the view of the monopoly consortia in those countries. Similarly, the attempt to vigorously apply the "Cold War" rules that imperialists are directing against the Soviet Union and other people's democratic countries to the trade union movement is not for the benefit of the workers, but is dictated by the interests of the monopoly capitalists; because international disputes are a good source of wealth for them.

There is no doubt that the resolutions passed by the WFTU Executive Committee in Paris are warmly embraced by workers in various countries. It is now clear that in rejecting the proposals of the Anglo-American labor traitors that could have collapsed the WFTU, the resolutions of the WFTU Executive Committee not only fully comply with the WFTU Constitution, but also with the will of millions of WFTU members. The WFTU's activities are sorely needed in order to defeat the conspiracies of the enemies of peace and security in all countries and to repel the reactionary attacks on the living standards of the masses and their freedoms and the freedoms of their unions. At this juncture, who would demand the dissolution of the WFTU, except the enemies of the working class?

The Executive Committee, in the name of more than sixty million trade union members on five continents, declared that the WFTU remains, severely condemned the splitters, and reiterated that the WFTU is a voluntary union of trade unions from all countries, regardless of their political orientation. The Executive Committee's resolutions and statements leave the door open to all trade union organizations, including the British TUC and the American CIO. What better proof is needed of the WFTU's sincere efforts for cooperation?

The Executive Committee not only announced that the WFTU would continue to work regardless of all the ultimatums of the enemies of unity, but also adopted concrete plans to expand and strengthen the WFTU's activities. Some of these were deliberately and stubbornly sabotaged by the British and American representatives. It was also decided to convene the Second World Congress on June 27, 1949, likely in Milan. Such a broad gathering of trade union representatives has long been acutely needed, but has been unsuccessful due to the opposition of the British and American leaders. Apparently, they feared that their opinions would not be supported at the meeting. Three and a half years have passed since the WFTU's founding congress in Paris, and the time has come to discuss the status of trade unions worldwide, to plan their future development path, and to formulate the WFTU's economic and social program.

The issue of establishing industrial departments, as stipulated in the WFTU Constitution, was also brought up for resolution. The main task of the industrial departments is to coordinate the activities of trade unions in various industries, but this has been unsuccessful due to the machinations of the British TUC. While deceptively pretending to support the idea of establishing industrial departments, the British trade union leaders incited the current International Trade Secretariats to refuse to participate in the WFTU.

The Executive Committee issued a final warning to the Secretariats, calling on them to change their adverse situation, to stand with the WFTU, and to jointly fight for the interests of workers in all industries. If this invitation is still rejected, the WFTU will establish industrial departments regardless of the existing Secretariats. It can no longer be tolerated that one of the main resolutions of the Paris World Trade Union Congress has not been implemented due to the bad faith of certain leaders of the International Trade Secretariats, who are more concerned with personal prestige and interests than with the welfare of the workers.

The Executive Committee paid considerable attention to the needs of trade unions in colonial and dependent countries. The leaders of the British and American trade unions had tried to instill in the WFTU staff the contempt for colonial trade unions that was prevalent in the Amsterdam International (i.e., the Yellow Trade Union International—translator's note). The former minister of the WFTU Colonial Department, Kupers (representative of the American CIO), shirked his work as much as possible and was indifferent to the interests of the African and Asian trade union movements. This situation no longer exists. It has been decided to establish an Asian Liaison Bureau in China, and a long-planned meeting of the WFTU Executive Bureau and Asian trade union representatives will be held in May. This meeting should be an important factor in developing the trade union movement in colonial and semi-colonial countries.

Even while the Executive Committee was still in session, it received a large number of congratulations, indicating that millions of workers have great confidence in the WFTU and hope that it will succeed in every effort for the welfare of the people. Telegrams from trade unions all over the world poured in, expressing heartfelt support for the WFTU. In particular, letters were also received from large trade unions in London, Birmingham, and other British cities, as well as from trade unions belonging to the American CIO. The joining of the WFTU by trade union organizations in Chile, the Philippines, Southern Rhodesia, Malta, Siam, and Tunisia, representing 500,000 members, strongly demonstrates the growing influence of the WFTU, which the slander of reactionary leaders and the rumors of reactionary newspapers are powerless to obstruct. The Executive Committee's decision to accept German and Japanese trade unions into the WFTU was warmly welcomed in both countries.

A cursory glance at the Executive Committee's resolutions is enough to show how far removed the predictions of the commentators of the British "Economist" magazine and the French "Le Monde" newspaper are from the facts! They were judging the situation of the WFTU based on the boasting of Deakin and Carey.

The failure of the plot to disintegrate the WFTU greatly upset the splitters. The newspapers of the Anglo-American monopoly capitalists replaced the praise and flattery of them from three or four weeks ago with indignant rebukes. Because the WFTU stands firm, and the splitters find themselves outside the world trade union movement, the true initiators of the plan to split the workers' movement cannot conceal their embarrassment.

What particularly annoys the Anglo-American reactionary newspapers is that Deakin and Carey did not even think to issue a "statement" explaining why they withdrew from the WFTU, so as not to make their behavior appear too repugnant to the workers. As if skillfully crafted documents could reverse black and white, or persuade people that the attempt to dissolve the WFTU was not for the benefit of the exploiting classes, and so on. The reactionaries are forcing the British TUC and the American CIO to quickly unite with the American Federation of Labor (AFL), at least to create some kind of "international" to confront the WFTU.

But this is not so easy or simple. One of the main difficulties for the builders of a new organization that can be recognized by the monopoly capitalists is the lack of materials. Of course, the French Jouhaux and his small group and the Italian Pastore and his Catholic group can be driven, but this is not enough to place the workers' movement in the Marshallized countries under American control, which the American masters are precisely trying to control. Ibáñez and his small group of followers from various South American countries can be hired with money, but the Confederation of Latin American Workers (CTAL) remains the true leader of millions of working people. No wonder Brown, the European agent of the Green (President of the American AFL - translator's note) faction, in explaining his plan to establish a new "international" in the Christian Science Monitor, emphasized the need to establish a general organization of Eastern European "free trade union" exiles.

The contradictions between these three trade union federations, which are trying to control the international labor movement, are also becoming increasingly apparent. Since the CIO withdrew from the WFTU, Green and his cronies have blatantly tried to push it into the background. According to the New York Times, the AFL has demanded recognition as the leader of the American trade unions. On the part of the TUC and the CIO, they continue to want to control the international organization they want to establish. This quarrel is a good illustration of the "democratic principles" in which Deakin, Carey, and Green beautifully proclaim their desire for cooperation.

Needless to say, the efforts to form a reactionary trade union international organization will be strengthened even more recently. The monopoly capitalists are very "interested" in this. As in the past many times, they will probably be able to reconcile their quarreling agents. This divisive activity can form a danger to the working class in all countries, but no matter whether Deakin, Carey, or Green serves as the capitalists' superintendent in the trade union movement, the workers are ultimately indifferent to it. What is important is the purpose and objectives of this planned international organization. It is clearly recognized as nothing more than an international organization for undermining strikes, a command post for opposing democratic elements in trade unions in various countries, and the foundation of an imperialist aggressive war policy.

Ressa, the labor movement columnist for the New York Daily Mirror, wrote that one of the main tasks of the new "international organization" is to oppose strikes; he also said that Dubinsky, Reuther, Minne and similar extremely reactionary reformists will be sent to some countries to advise workers not to rely on strikes.

This alone illustrates the servile nature of the planned international organization. Everyone knows that in capitalist countries, when all methods of safeguarding workers' rights are exhausted, workers rely on the weapon of strikes as the last resort to protect their interests. Now, in order to attempt to calmly and fearlessly issue orders to Western European countries, the American monopoly capitalists want to deprive the workers of this weapon.

Trade unions and trade union activists all over the world will watch with high vigilance the conspiracies of the enemies who undermine the unity of the working class and who are striving to make trade unions serve the capitalists.

To millions of working people in all countries, regardless of race, color, religion, or political belief, the WFTU is a victorious symbol of their struggle for adequate living conditions, democracy, and peace. The slogans engraved on the WFTU banner are clear and lofty. These slogans have won the WFTU the sympathy of the working class all over the world and unite all those who truly value the interests of the people, peace, and social progress around the WFTU.

　　世界工联为工人阶级的团结而奋斗
    沙丁  作  刘诗嵘  译
    英美工贼们与世界工联决裂后，在工人阶级的敌人阵营里曾涌起一阵子狂欢。反动报章称这些分裂者为英雄，狄金、加莱和古柏斯成为一时的宠儿。反动评论家们也“欢快的”宣布世界工联的灭亡。例如伦敦区（伦敦的经济中心，相当于纽约的华尔街——译者）的机关杂志“经济家”写道：
    “英、美、荷兰代表退出后，世界工联甚至不能再假装为真正的职工国际了。”
    和大资本家密切连系着的巴黎世界日报以同样的声调断然宣称：“世界工联现在已失去其‘世界’联盟的名称和工联全部力量的普遍性。”
    但是以后的事实与发展已说明了欲实现其愿望的反动派的预言是多么的没有根据。狄金、加莱和古柏斯叛离后的工联仍不失为世界的联盟，与当石屋及其“工人力量”的伙伴们退出后的法国总工会不失为法国的总工会是一样的。自然，世界工联受到了这些分裂者的损害。但英、美和荷兰的工人由于这非正义的行为和强迫使他们脱离进步的国际职工运动的企图而受害最深。在英、美及荷兰对此举所引起的抗议，充分证明了下层职工运动者对蕴藏着的危险是警觉的。为实现世界工联的国际团结与合作的思想是深深地印在千百万劳动人民的脑筋里。
    英国职工大会和美国产联的代表们想以脱离世界工联使工联的拥护者的队伍陷入混乱，而致工联失败。但教唆分裂的人们很明显的失去了对现实的感觉。他们忽略了或未认识到世界工联和工会队伍中深刻的变化。
    自从英美集团的代表们退出后，世界工联执行机构的决议一再强调两三个国家的工会就能完全控制和指导国际职工运动的命运的时代，已肯定地和第二次世界大战同时完结。许多国家的工会已成为群众组织，并在国家生活中起着重大的作用。它们非常正确的拒绝了在国际事业中歧视的意图。各国工会之间是没有基本差别的，这些差别可能使他们不为保证劳动人民的共同利益而一起工作，这在巴黎会议之后显得更清楚了。个别问题上不同的意见并不有碍于在国际组织内合作的可能，但恰巧是英美代表们缺少这种愿望；这件事实是他们在执行局最近一次会议上所不能掩饰的。狄金，加莱和古柏斯为了要使自己站得住，使大放厥词说“苏联工会要控制世界工联”，“共产党工会在制造阴谋”等等。
    职工会不是党的组织，这是苏联工人们的看法，在与别国工会的关系上他们坚决把握着这个观点。但事实上有的工会的领袖们热切维护工人阶级的利益，有的领袖们却不然。狄金、加莱和古柏斯实际与某些分子持共同意见，这些分子恐惧在为争取较高工资和较好的工作条件、反对法西斯和战争与求实巩固持久的和平的奋斗中，各国工会更密切的合作。
    不用说，这不是英、美和荷兰工人们的观点，而是那些国家中独占财团的观点。同样，将帝国主义者正对苏联及其他人民民主国家“冷战”的法则极力运用到对职工运动上去，也不是为了工人利益的目的，而是受着独占资本家利益的指使；因为国际纷争对他们是一笔很好的财源。
    巴黎世界工联执委会所通过的决议，得到各国工人的热烈拥戴是毫无疑问的。现在很明显，在否决英美工贼们可能使工联崩溃的提案中，工联执委会的决议不但完全符合工联章程，也符合千百万工联会员的意志。为了击败各国和平安全的敌人的阴谋诡计，为了击退反动派向群众的生活水准和他们及工会的自由之不断进攻，工联的活动是非常需要的。值此时机，除了工人阶级的敌人，谁会要求解散工联呢？
    执委会以五大洲六千多万工会会员的名义宣称工联仍旧保持，严厉的斥责了分裂分子并再度强调世界工联是各国工会自愿的联合，而不论其政治倾向如何。执委会的决议和声明向一切工会组织开着大门，英国职工大会和美国产联亦不例外。对工联诚心为合作而努力还需要什么更好的证明呢？
    执委会不但宣布工联将不顾团结的敌人的一切最后通牒而继续工作，并通过扩展加强工联活动的具体方案。其中有的是一向为英美代表们有意顽强的加以破坏的。也决定一九四九年六月二十七日召开第二次世界代表大会，地点大约是米兰。这样一个工会代表广泛的集合是老早就极感需要的，但由于英美领袖们的反对一直未能成功。很显然的，他们害怕自己的意见在会上不会有人支持。自工联在巴黎的成立大会到现在已三年有半，讨论工会在全世界的地位、规划其将来发展的道路和形成工联的经济社会纲领的时候已经来临。
    如在工联章程中所规定成立产业部的问题亦提出解决。产业部主要工作为在各产业中配合工会而活动，但由于英国职工大会的阴谋一直未能成立。英国工会领袖们一面欺骗工联假装支持成立产业部的意见，一面鼓动现在的国际职业工会秘书处拒绝参加世界工联。
    执委会最后一次告诫秘书处，号召他们改变自己恶劣的情势，来和世界工联站在一起，为维护各业工人的利益而共同奋斗，假若这个邀请仍被拒绝，世界工联将不管现存的秘书处而成立产业部。由于国际职业工会秘书处某些领导者不守信用，对个人的威信与利益比对工人的福利更为关注，以致巴黎世界职工大会的主要决议之一仍未实行，这是再也不能容忍的了。
    执委会对殖民地和附庸国工会的需要是相当注意的，英美工会的领袖们曾想在世界工联人员中灌输在阿姆斯特丹国际（即黄色职工国际——译者）中流行的轻视殖民工会的思想。世界工联殖民地部的前任部长考甫（美国产联的代表），就对他的工作尽量怠工，并对非洲及亚洲职工运动的利益漠不关心。现在这种情形已经没有了。已经决定在中国成立亚洲联络局，并将在五月召开久已筹划的工联执行局及亚洲工会代表的会议。对在开展殖民地和半殖民地国家的职工运动上，这个会议应是一个重要的因素。
    甚至当执委会仍在开会期间，已接到大量的祝贺，说明千百万工人对工联表示极大的信任，并希望它在每一项为人民福利的工作上都能成功。世界各处工会的电信蜂涌而至，表示衷心支持世界工联。特别是也收到了伦敦、伯明翰及其它英国城市里大工会和属于美国产联的工会的信件。智利、菲律宾、南罗得西亚、马尔他、暹罗和突尼斯的工会组织加入工联，代表着五十万会员；此事强烈的证明工联正在增涨的影响，反动头子们的诽谤和反动报纸的谣言无力加以阻挠。执委会决定接受德国及日本的工会加入工联，受到这两个国家热烈的欢迎。
    仅就执委会的决议大略一看，便足以显出英国“经济家杂志”和法国世界日报评论员们的预见距事实是何等遥远！他们是依据了狄金和加莱的吹牛来判断世界工联的情况的。
    瓦解世界工联诡计的失败，使分裂分子大为不安了，英美独占资本家的报纸以愤慨的责骂代替三四个星期前对他们的称赞恭维。由于世界工联屹立不动，而分裂分子发现自己处于世界职工运动的外面，分裂工人运动计划的真正发起者不能掩饰其窘状。
    使英美反动报纸特别着恼的是狄金和加莱竟没有想到发表一篇什么“声明”，解释他们为何退出工联，以便使他们这种行为在工人眼中不致显得太招人厌。好象巧妙制造的文件可以颠倒黑白，或说服人们取消工联的企图并不是为了剥削阶级的利益等等。反动派们正在迫令英职工大会和美产联赶快与美国劳联联合，至少得造成一个什么“国际”来和世界工联对抗。
    但这并不那么容易简单。能为独占资本家所认可的新组织建筑者主要的困难之一就是缺乏材料。当然可以驱使法国的石屋及其小集团和意大利的巴士托里及其天主教集团，但这不足以在马歇尔化了的国家中将工人运动置于美国控制之下，而美国主子们恰是力图要控制的。伊本尼兹及其一小撮南美各国的党徒们虽可以以金钱来雇用，但南美总工会仍是千百万劳动人民的真正领导者。难怪格林（美国劳联的主席—译者）一派的欧洲代理人布郎在基督教科学箴言报上解释其成立新“国际”的计划，非常强调需要成立东欧“自由工会”流亡的总机构。
    企图控制国际工运的这三个总工会的矛盾亦日益明显。自从产联退出世界工联后，格林及其朋党便露骨的极力想将它排斥到幕后。据纽约时报载称，劳联已要求承认其为美国工会的领导。在职工大会和产联这方面，则继续要控制他们想成立的国际组织，对狄金、加莱和格林漂亮的宣称他们渴望合作中的“民主原则”，这种争吵是很好的说明。
    不用说，要形成一个反动派的工会国际组织的努力，在最近要更为加强。独占资本家们对此非常感到“兴趣”，如在过去屡次一样的，他们大概能使其互相争吵的代理人和解。这分裂的活动对各国工人阶级来说能形成为一种危险，但无论是狄金、加莱或格林谁在职工运动中充任资本家的总管，工人毕竟是对之冷淡的。重要的是这个筹划成立的国际组织的宗旨和目的，很明显地被公认为是破坏罢工的国际机构、反对各国工会中民主分子的运动的指挥部和帝国主义侵略战争政策的基础而已。
    纽约每日镜报工运专栏作家雷萨，曾写道：新的“国际组织”的主要任务之一就是反对罢工；又说：杜宾斯基、吕特、明尼和类似的极端反动的改良主义者将被派到一些国家去劝告工人不要依靠罢工。
    只此事已说明在筹划的国际组织之奴隶性。谁都知道，在资本主义国家，当所有维护工人权益的方法都用尽时，工人依仗罢工这件武器为保护他们利益的最后办法。现在美国的独占资本家们为了企图坦然无惧地向西欧各国发号施令，所以要剥夺工人这件武器。
    全世界工会和职工运动者们将以高度的警觉注视破坏工人阶级团结的敌人的阴谋，他们极力要使工会为资本家们服务。
    对各国千百万劳动人民，不分种族、肤色、宗教及政治信仰，世界工联是他们为适当的生存条件、民主与和平而奋斗的胜利的象征。镌于工联旗帜上的口号是明显的崇高的。这些口号已为工联赢得全世界工人阶级对它的同情，并将一切真正重视人民的利益、和平与社会进步的人们团结在工联的周围。
