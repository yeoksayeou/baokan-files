　　东北实物公债认购者极踊跃
    【新华社沈阳十四日电】为加强东北工业建设而发行的实物有奖公债，正在东北各城市积极推销中。自上月初东北行政委员会公布公债发行条例以来，沈阳、哈尔滨、长春、吉林、齐齐哈尔、安东等地均已先后成立公债劝募委员会，从事劝募工作。沈阳市劝募委员会于本月一日开始工作，至十日止，全市即有工商业者一万余户共认购公债二百万份，合东北流通券一千八百亿元，占全东北本年度上期公债发行额的三分之一。哈尔滨市亦于本月三日成立公债劝募委员会开始劝募。齐齐哈尔市工商会于四日召开工商业主一千三百余人的劝募公债大会，当场认购者极为踊跃。安东市劝募委员会设分会七个，分头进行劝募工作。除工商业主外，全市工人和职员也都热心认购。吉林市各机关及人民团体特抽调二百人组织宣传队赴各区劝募。该市各学校师生亦积极参加此项工作。
