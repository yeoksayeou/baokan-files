Hebei-Shandong-Henan Region Inspects Production

[Hebei-Shandong-Henan Telegram] The Sixth Prefectural Office of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Region convened a meeting of the heads of agricultural departments and directors of agricultural extension stations from various counties on the 16th of last month to inspect the production plans of the prefectural office and various counties. It was deemed that the first, and undeniable, shortcoming was insufficient understanding of the agricultural production policy focusing on increasing grain production, and a lack of correct assessment of the basic situation that the Sixth Special District is a grain-producing area. Consequently, in the previous period, emphasis was placed solely on tasks such as planting trees and flax, while publicity and specific organizational leadership for spring plowing were extremely neglected, leading to a tendency to abandon leadership of spring plowing in the work of enlisting in the army. Secondly, the cotton planting figures for the Sixth Special District are relatively large, but most farmers have no habit of growing cotton, and it is necessary to publicize this to them and help them solve the difficulty of obtaining cotton seeds. However, insufficient attention was paid to this point in the plan, and the survey and statistics of cotton seeds have not yet been completed. Furthermore, the Ninth Prefectural Office, in its inspection of the production plan, also believed that the estimates exceeded the reality and were simply formulated based on the administrative office's plan. The plans of the counties under its jurisdiction, with the exception of Guancheng and Fan counties, which were more practical, generally had the following shortcomings: excessive demands for increased production without guaranteed conditions for completion; failure to pay attention to the ideological mobilization and specific organizational leadership work of cadres and the masses; lack of confidence in the two tasks of weeding wheat and mobilizing 50 percent of the young and middle-aged women to participate in major agricultural labor; and failure to make specific plans for water conservancy construction. Everyone believed that errors and shortcomings in the plan should be corrected at any time so that the plan would gradually become practical and conducive to completion.

　　计划不切实际
  　冀鲁豫检查生产
    【冀鲁豫电】冀鲁豫区六专署上月十六日召开各县农业科长及农业推广场主任会议，对专署及各县生产计划作了检查。认为第一个不容忽视的缺点，是对以增产粮食为主的农业生产方针认识不足，对六专区是产粮区这一基本情况缺乏正确估计，因而前段单纯强调了植树种麻子等项工作，而对春耕工作的宣传及具体的组织领导则极为忽视，造成在参军工作中放弃春耕领导的偏向。其次，六专区的种棉数字较大，但多数农民无种棉习惯，需要向他们宣传，并帮助解决棉种困难。但在计划中注意这点不够，棉种的调查统计至今尚未做好。又九专署在检查生产计划中，亦认为估计多于事实，只是简单地根据行署计划制定出来。所属各县除观城、范县的计划较切实外，其他各县计划多存在下述缺点：增产要求过高、无保证完成的条件；未注意干部及群众的思想动员和具体组织领导工作；对锄麦及动员百分之五十的青壮年妇女参加农业主要劳动两项工作缺乏信心；对兴修水利工作未作出具体计划。大家认为应随时修正计划中的错误与缺点，使计划逐步切合实际而利于完成。
