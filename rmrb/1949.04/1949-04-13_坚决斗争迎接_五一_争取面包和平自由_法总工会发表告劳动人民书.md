Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 11th: TASS, Paris, April 9th: The French General Confederation of Labor issued a letter to the French working people in celebration of May Day. It stated: May 1st, the day of international labor solidarity, has particularly significant meaning for the French proletariat this year. Some are attempting to deprive you of your daily bread and infringe upon your rights and freedoms. The propaganda regarding the economic revival of France is completely inconsistent with the facts. The gap between wages and the cost of living is difficult to conceal. They are using every means to keep the working class living in hardship. The rulers and employers are trying to prevent the improvement of the working class's living standards. Complete or partial unemployment plunges working families into poverty. The reactionary faction in power is launching an offensive against traditional rights and the right to strike. The fascist threat represented by de Gaulle is gradually taking shape. Because the government is preparing for war, it is pursuing a policy of reaction, bankruptcy, and poverty, and is spending large sums of money on it. The reactionary government signed the anti-democratic and anti-Soviet aggressive North Atlantic Treaty, pushing France onto a path of adventure. But the French people will reject war. They will forever remain faithful to the friendship of the Soviet Union, which saved the world from Hitlerism. The General Confederation of Labor calls on the working people—Communists, Socialists, and People's Republicans, as well as non-party people, trade union members, and people from all walks of life—to unite and fight for bread, peace, and freedom.

    法总工会发表告劳动人民书
    【新华社北平十一日电】塔斯社巴黎九日讯：法国总工会为迎接五一节特发表告法国劳动人民书。内称：五月一日，国际劳动者团结的日子，在今年对法国无产阶级有特别重大的意义。有人正在试图剥夺你们每天的面包，侵害你们的权利和自由。关于法国经济复兴的宣传，完全不符事实。工资与生活费用之间的距离，难以掩盖。他们正用一切方法使工人阶级继续生活于困苦境地。统治者和雇主们力图阻止工人阶级生活的改善。完全或部分的失业使工人家庭陷于穷困。当权的反动派对传统的权利和对罢工权利发动攻势。以戴高乐为代表的法西斯威胁逐渐形成。政府因为正在准备战争，所以推行反动、破产和贫困的政策，并且将大量金钱用在这上面。反动政府签字于反民主反苏的侵略的北大西洋公约，把法国推上了冒险的道路。但是法国人民将要摈弃战争。他们将永远忠实于把世界从希特勒主义中拯救出来的苏联的友谊。总工会号召劳动人民——共产党人、社会党人和人民共和党和无党无派人民、工会会员及其他各界人民联合起来，为面包、和平、自由而斗争。
