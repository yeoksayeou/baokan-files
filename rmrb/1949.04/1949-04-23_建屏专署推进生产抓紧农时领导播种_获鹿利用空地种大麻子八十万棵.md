The Jianping Prefectural Office Promotes Production, Grasps the Farming Season, and Leads Sowing

　　Huolu Utilizes Vacant Land to Plant 800,000 Hemp Seedlings

[Chahar News] The Jianping Prefectural Office recently summarized the production work before Qingming and determined the production plan from Qingming to Mangzhong and its implementation methods. Currently, the entire prefecture has planted 1,061,129 trees. The planting process emphasized the protection of trees, effectively stimulating the enthusiasm of the masses for planting trees. To ensure the completion of this year's cotton and peanut planting tasks, the advancement cooperatives in various counties have prepared 242,900 jin of cotton seeds and 134,000 jin of peanut seeds. The sowing of early-maturing crops has been done in a timely manner, and the amount of fertilizer applied has increased. To supplement the shortage of fertilizer, the four counties of Xingtang, Jianping, Huolu, and Fuping have prepared 86,000 jin of oil cakes. The four counties of Xingtang, Jingxing, Zhengding, and Pingshan have produced 117,500 jin of bone fertilizer. In terms of water conservancy, the five counties of Jianping, Pingshan, Xingtang, Lingshou, and Fuping have repaired 171 old canals; in addition to assisting in the repair of old waterwheels and wells in waterwheel irrigation areas, Xingtang, Huolu, and Pingshan counties have lent out 109 new waterwheels, ensuring timely sowing and wheat irrigation. The work of substitution farming has been widely valued. One-third of the villages in Jianping, Xingtang, and Lingshou counties have determined contract farming, and other villages are continuing to contract. A total of 280,000 jin of relief grain has been allocated to disaster areas to organize disaster victims to engage in production for self-relief and to organize mutual assistance and borrowing between relatives and friends in disaster and non-disaster areas to overcome difficulties and tide over the spring famine. These achievements have laid a favorable foundation for this year's large-scale production work, but in many areas, there are still many problems in production leadership: (1) The implementation of production plans and increased production tasks is not thorough and universal enough. The preparation of seeds cannot keep up with the needs of the masses. Some county and village cadres believe that production does not require leadership. Furthermore, a small number of village cadres are not active and responsible in their work. They are unwilling to attend meetings in the county, or only send general cadres to attend meetings. After the meeting, they do not convey the information to the masses, and there is a lack of specific organizational leadership, resulting in production work being in a state of laissez-faire. (2) There is a lack of in-depth publicity and understanding of the situation. Some district and village cadres are very enthusiastic about leading production and are very serious about completing production plans; but instead of educating the masses about the benefits of growing more cotton and peanuts, they adopt a top-down distribution method and cater to the narrow and conservative view of farmers who want to grow whatever they eat, making farmers think that production is to complete tasks for the higher authorities, which fosters the idea of relying on the higher authorities to solve the difficulties of seeds. (3) Some village cadres are arrogant and undisciplined, look down on the new district cadres, and neither accept the leadership of the higher authorities nor actively work. In addition, there are still a few villages where gambling and superstition are rampant, and backward religious sects are secretly active, which all affect the implementation and development of the production movement. (4) Not enough attention is paid to organizing and mobilizing women to participate in production, and there is no specific leadership for the masses to overcome difficulties based on the season. Based on the experience of the previous stage, the prefectural office has determined the plan and leadership focus from Qingming to Mangzhong: From Qingming to the Beginning of Summer, efforts should be made to lead the sowing of cotton fields and peanuts. Watering wheat should be timely, "water wheat when it is young" and "water millet when it is old," and it is advocated to water and hoe wheat fields early, making it possible to increase the yield of each mu of wheat field by five jin. It is also necessary to lead the sowing of autumn crops, and mountainous drylands should be prepared and sown early. From the Beginning of Summer to Mangzhong, in addition to a small number of wheat fields and some drylands, the sowing of autumn crops should be completed. Dry seedlings should be hoed over. Fuping, Xingtang, Quyang, and Jianping, which produce dates, and Quyang, which produces pears, should have a planned and organized leadership to prevent and control pests, and the jujubes and pears should not be damaged due to agricultural production. All canal beach flood control dyke construction and flood control river management projects must be completed, and the repair of waterwheels and wells, and the loan of new waterwheels, should be completed for the majority. In order to ensure the completion of this plan, the prefectural office has determined a number of specific methods, among which it is particularly proposed that if it does not rain during the sowing season, the masses should be organized to carry water and sow, especially for cotton, beans, and corn. It also emphasizes strengthening the ideological education of village cadres and rectifying organizational discipline to enhance production leadership. The prefectural office has now organized working groups to go to various counties to help supervise and inspect the current large-scale production work. (Cheng Guoquan)

[Chahar News] Cadres and the masses in Huolu County are using all available idle land, mountainsides, banks, and ditch edges to launch a large-scale hemp seed planting campaign. As of Qingming Festival, in the preliminary statistics of only 130 villages out of the county's 229 villages, 800,717 seedlings have been planted. (Wang Zhen)

　　建屏专署推进生产抓紧农时领导播种
    获鹿利用空地种大麻子八十万棵
    【察哈尔讯】建屏专署顷总结清明前生产工作，确定清明至芒种生产计划及其实现办法。现全专区植树一百零六万一千一百二十九株，植树中强调了林木的保护，有效地启发了群众植树的积极性。为保证完成今年种棉与花生的任务，各县推进社准备棉种二十四万二千九百斤，花生种十三万四千斤。早熟作物播种已作到及时，施肥量增多。为补充肥料不足，行唐、建屏、获鹿、阜平四县准备油饼八万六千斤。行唐、井陉、正定、平山四县制骨肥十一万七千五百斤。在水利方面，建屏、平山、行唐、灵寿、阜平五县已修复旧渠一百七十一道；另在水车灌溉地区除扶助整修旧水车水井外，现行唐、获鹿、平山三县已贷出新水车一百零九架，保证了及时播种与浇麦。代耕工作被普遍重视起来，建屏、行唐、灵寿三县已有三分之一村庄确定了包耕，其他村正在继续出包。灾荒地区拨发救济粮二十八万斤，组织了灾民生产自救，并组织灾区与非灾区亲朋之间互助互借，克服困难，渡过春荒。这些成绩给今年大生产工作打下有利基础，但在不少地区，生产领导上尚存在不少问题：（一）对生产计划与增产任务贯彻不够深入普遍，种籽的准备还赶不上群众的需要，有些县区村干部认为生产勿须领导。再，少数村干部对工作不积极负责，不愿到县区开会，或只派一般干部去开会，会后不向群众传达，又缺乏具体组织领导，生产工作形成自流状态。（二）缺乏深入宣传、了解情况。有些区村干部对领导生产热情很高，对完成生产计划很认真；但不是教育群众了解多种棉花、花生的好处，而是采取自上而下的分配方法，并迁就农民吃什么种什么的狭隘保守观点，使农民认为生产是为上级完成任务，助长了依赖上级解决籽种困难的思想。（三）部分村干部自高自大和无组织无纪律，看不起新的区干部，既不接受上级领导亦不积极工作，另外还有少数村庄赌博、迷信，落后教门暗中活动，这些都影响着生产运动的贯彻与开展。（四）对组织起来与发动妇女参加生产重视不够，没有根据季节，具体领导群众克服困难。根据上一阶段的经验，专署确定了清明至芒种的计划与领导重点：清明至立夏，要大力领导棉田与花生的播种。放水浇麦要作到及时，“麦浇小”“谷浇老”，提倡早浇与锄麦田，使每亩麦田增产五斤成为可能。并领导大秋作物播种，山岳旱地更要早作准备，早播种。立夏至芒种，除少数麦田与部分旱地外，要全部完成大秋作物播种。旱苗要锄过头遍。山岳地区的阜平、行唐、曲阳、建屏产枣地区与曲阳产梨村庄，要有计划有组织地领导群众防治虫害，不能因农业生产而使枣梨受到损失。各渠滩防洪筑堤与防洪治河工程必须全部完成，水车水井的整修，与新水车的出贷要争取完成大部。为保证这一计划的完成，专署确定了若干具体办法，其中特别提出一到播种节令时如天不下雨，即应组织群众担水点播，特别是对棉、豆、玉茭。并强调加强村干部的思想教育与整顿组织纪律，以增强生产领导。现专署已组织工作组到各县帮助督促检查当前大生产工作。（程国权）
    【察哈尔讯】获鹿全县干部、群众利用一切闲地、山边、岸坡、沟沿，展开点种大麻子运动。截止清明节，全县二百二十九个村，仅一百三十个村的初步统计，已种八十万零七千七百一十七棵。（王祯）
