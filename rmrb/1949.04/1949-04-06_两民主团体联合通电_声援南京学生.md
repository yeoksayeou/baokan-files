Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, 5th. The China Association for Promoting Democracy and the Shanghai People's Organizations Federation jointly issued a telegram on the 5th to express their support for the struggle of Nanjing students. The telegram reads as follows:

　　To the students of Nanjing! To the compatriots of the whole country!

　　On the first day of the peace talks, the Kuomintang reactionary government perpetrated a bloody massacre of Nanjing students who demanded genuine peace. The Kuomintang reactionaries' slaughter of the people and beatings of students have always been their consistent practice! However, in recent months, under the continuous and fatal blows of the powerful People's Liberation Army, it has made various gestures of peace and democracy. The Nanjing massacre exposed the ferocious original form behind this posture without any disguise. This major blood case on the first day of the peace talks is the so-called expression of the Kuomintang reactionary government's demand for peace! This is the essence of the Kuomintang reactionary government's claim to value public opinion! If the Kuomintang reactionary government does not swiftly punish the murderers, does not take practical actions to ensure the safety and freedom of the people, and does not accept the eight terms for peace, then even if the peace talks are successful and both sides sign the agreement, it will definitely tear up the treaty and make a comeback once it has had a chance to catch its breath. The peace that the people demand is genuine peace, not the deception of peace. Therefore, we demand that the CCP adhere to the eight terms in the peace talks, and we hope that the people of the whole country will be vigilant and not put a snake feigning death in their bosom. The snake in Nanjing is biting people! We must avenge the students of Nanjing, those who were bitten to death and those who were bitten and injured, and completely eliminate the snakes! Students, your blood has not been shed in vain! You have already exposed the reactionary government's conspiracy of peace to the compatriots of the whole country. You have clearly told the people that everyone must carry the revolution through to the end! Compatriots in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, continue to fight, victory is just around the corner. The People's Liberation Army, which is about to cross the Yangtze River and advance southward, is your backing.

　　两民主团体联合通电
  　声援南京学生
    【新华社北平五日电】中国民主促进会和上海人民团体联合会于五日发表联合通电，声援南京学生的斗争。电文如下：
    南京的同学们！全国的同胞们！
    和平谈判开始的第一天，国民党反动政府就制造了屠杀要求真正和平的南京学生的大血案。国民党反动派屠杀人民，殴打学生，原是一贯的作风！但是近几个月来，在强大的人民解放军接连不断的致命打击之下，它曾经做出种种和平民主的姿态。南京惨案把这个姿态背后的凶恶的原形一丝不挂地暴露出来了。这个和谈第一天的大血案，就是国民党反动政府所谓要求和平的表现！就是国民党反动政府所声的以民意为重的实质！国民党反动政府如果不迅速惩办凶手，不以实际的行为来保障人民的安全与自由，来接受对和平的八项条件，则即使和谈成功，双方签了字，等到它喘息既定以后，也必会撕毁和约，卷土重来，人民所要求的和平是真正的和平，不是和平的欺骗。因此，我们要求中共在和谈中坚持八项条件，并且希望全国人民警觉起来，别把装死的毒蛇放在胸口里，南京的毒蛇正在咬人呢！我们要为南京的同学们，被咬死被咬伤的同学们报仇，彻底消灭毒蛇们！同学们，你们的血不是白流的，你们已经给全国的同胞揭穿了反动政府和平的阴谋，你们已经明白地告诉了人民大家必须把革命进行到底！国民党统治区的同胞们，继续奋斗，胜利就在面前，即将渡江南进的人民解放军，就是你们的后盾。
