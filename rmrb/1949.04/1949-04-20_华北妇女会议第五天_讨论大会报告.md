  　Discussion of the Conference Report
    [From Our Newspaper] On the fifth day of the North China Women's Representative Conference, the delegates discussed the reports by Comrade Qu Mengjue and Comrade Yang Yunyu.

During the deliberations, specific topics were divided, and each delegation nominated a central speaker to address the conference.
    Representatives from Shijiazhuang, while introducing the work of urban women, emphasized that it is necessary to first strengthen the work of female workers, to integrate with the lives of female workers, understand their past sufferings, and solve their current difficulties in order to do the work well. In order to mobilize rural women to participate in major agricultural labor, first, based on past experience, we should further make them aware of the relationship between the development of rural production and the vital interests of women, and help them solve the difficulties in participating in production, in order to give full play to their enthusiasm for production. Comrade Li Zhiguang, the director of the Shijiazhuang Nursery, gave a detailed explanation of the importance of nursery staff (i.e., nannies) in childcare work, and called on female comrades with children to personally participate in childcare work to help solve the current difficulties of nurseries and kindergartens. Representatives from directly affiliated organizations, when talking about the training of female cadres, first demanded that female cadres consciously strengthen their studies, work hard, and overcome the situation of paying excessive attention to trivial matters in life. Secondly, they requested that the leadership provide more help to improve the level of female cadres, help various organizations establish nurseries to solve the personal difficulties of female cadres. Family members of cadres should be organized to participate in various productions, develop a spirit of independence and self-sufficiency, reduce the burden on the public, and the leadership should help them go to various technical training classes to learn production skills.
