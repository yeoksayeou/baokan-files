Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, April 14th: The Changxindian Railway Machinery Plant, with over two thousand employees, officially established its trade union on the 2nd of this month. He Fengting, Qi Tengjiao, and twelve others were elected as members of the trade union committee. This is the result of three mass movements jointly launched by the trade union preparatory committee and the plant's administration since the preparatory work began in late January. In the initial stage of the preparatory committee's work, employees were not enthusiastic about joining the union. The preparatory committee, based on the issues that employees were concerned about at the time, launched a factory-wide discussion. During the twenty-plus days of extensive discussion from February 20th to March 12th, the political consciousness of the employees was greatly enhanced, and they joined the trade union one after another. Subsequently, in order to complete the urgent task of producing 10,000 large railway fishplates within a week, the plant launched a shock competition campaign from March 14th to 20th. In this vigorous campaign, the number of employees joining the union increased sharply to 2,000. After the competition, all ten factories and a general office successively launched election campaigns to elect the trade union committees for each unit and the entire plant. The election campaign lasted for more than ten days. Under the leadership of comrades from the work teams, each trade union group first held meetings to discuss the qualifications of trade union committee members, then nominated candidates, and then conducted elections by secret ballot (workshops with too many candidates held preliminary elections first). Members were able to fully exercise democracy and freely and conscientiously elected their own trade union committee members. The elections in all units were completed on April 2nd. On the 6th, the entire plant held a trade union establishment conference and celebrated the victorious completion of the shock task of 10,000 fishplates. All employees unanimously stated that they must carry forward the revolutionary tradition of "February 7th," avoid complacency, and strive to complete even greater production tasks.

[This Newspaper's Report] The Changxindian Work Group arrived at various factories and sections to carry out trade union work after the liberation of Changxindian last December. Now that trade unions have been generally established in various factories, in order to unify the leadership of the trade union movement, the work group formally announced its dissolution on the 8th.

　　长辛店铁路机厂
  　职工会正式成立
    【新华社北平十四日电】拥有两千余职工的长辛店铁路机厂职工会，已于本月二日成立，何凤亭、齐腾蛟等十二人当选为职工会委员。这是该会筹备工作自一月下旬开始以来该会筹委会与机厂行政方面共同发动三次群众运动的结果。该会筹备之初，职工们入会并不踊跃。筹委会乃根据当时职工们所关心的问题，发动全厂展开大讨论。在二月二十日至三月十二日的二十余天的大讨论中，职工们的政治觉悟大为提高，纷纷加入工会。接着，机厂为完成一星期内赶制一万块大型铁道夹板的紧急任务、在三月十四日至二十日间展开突击竞赛运动，在这轰轰烈烈的运动中，入会职工又猛增至二千人。竞赛结束后，全厂十个工厂和一个总办公室即相继展开选举运动，选举各单位职工会和全厂职工会的委员。选举运动历时十余天，各工会小组在工作组同志领导下先开会讨论职工会委员的条件，继之提出候选人，然后用无记名投票方式进行选举（候选人人数太多的工场先举行初选），会员们可以根据自己意愿选举候选名单以外的任何人。会员们在选举中充分发扬了民主，毫无拘束而又严肃认真地选出了自己的职工会委员。四月二日，各单位选举完毕。六日全厂召开职工会成立大会，并庆祝突击一万块夹板任务的胜利完成。全体职工们一致表示：今后一定要发扬“二七”的革命传统，不骄傲自满，为完成更大的生产任务而努力。
    【本报讯】长辛店工作组，去年十二月长辛店解放后，即到各厂各段进行工运工作，现各厂职工会普遍建立，为统一领导工运，工作组乃于八日正式宣布撤销。
