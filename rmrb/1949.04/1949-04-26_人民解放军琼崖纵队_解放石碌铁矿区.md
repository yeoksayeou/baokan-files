Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 25th. News: The People's Liberation Army Qiongya Column liberated the largest mining area on Hainan Island, the Shilu Iron Mine Area, on the afternoon of the 17th of this month, and completely eliminated the defending enemy. The mining area is located in the southwest corner of Baisha, spanning twenty li, with complete internal equipment and a large scale. However, it ceased operations after the Kuomintang took it over from the Japanese invaders. The Resource Committee of the puppet Executive Yuan had an office there and sent a platoon (equivalent to a company) of mine police to defend it. The puppet Baisha County government and its subordinate two companies of the Self-Defense Force were also stationed in the mining area, with eleven bunkers built around it. In addition, a company of the 159th Division of the Kuomintang army was stationed in Baoqiao, thirty li from the mining area. The People's Liberation Army launched an attack at 4:00 PM on the 16th, and by 7:00 AM on the 17th, had annihilated the enemy mine police platoon and occupied most of the mining area. At 3:00 PM, the remaining defenders in the mining area and the enemy in Baoqiao surrendered one after another. In this battle, a total of 189 enemies were captured, including Zhao Kegang, the puppet Baisha County magistrate and commander of the puppet Self-Defense Force, Chen Wencai, the deputy commander, and Huang Decheng, the machine gun company commander of the Second Battalion of the 126th Regiment of the 159th Division, etc.; 15 enemies were killed; 17 light machine guns of various types, 166 rifles, more than ten warehouses, and many other military supplies were seized. The materials in the mining area were not damaged. The People's Liberation Army has sent personnel to organize a management committee to manage it.
