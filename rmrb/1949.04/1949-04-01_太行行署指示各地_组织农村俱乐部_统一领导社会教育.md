Taihang Administrative Office Directs Localities to Organize Rural Clubs and Unify Leadership of Social Education

[Taihang Telegram] In order to raise the political consciousness of the masses and meet the strong cultural learning demands of the vast number of emancipated peasants, the Taihang Administrative Office has recently instructed localities to organize rural clubs to strengthen social education work, requiring old areas, semi-old areas, and even new areas to seize all possibilities to organize mass learning. The content of social education is stipulated as current events, production, democratic construction (ending practical work), and cultural education (with a focus on eliminating illiteracy, conducting scientific production technology education, and anti-superstition education). The directive stated: The past forms of winter schools and people's schools can no longer meet the requirements of today's situation, and rural clubs are a more suitable form. The nature, tasks, and organization of the clubs are defined as follows: (1) The club is the centralized leading body for mass cultural education in rural areas. Its task is to pave the way for the central work under the leadership of the village government, conduct systematic ideological education targeting the masses' thinking, and be responsible for organizing cultural and recreational activities in the village. (2) The club is organized by the village government's education director, volunteer teachers, primary school teachers, and those who are enthusiastic about mass education and love cultural entertainment to form a club committee, which is responsible for regular organizational activities. The committee has departments for political education, cultural education, and cultural entertainment. Activities are carried out by making full use of broadcasting stations, mass blackboards, production technology and medical and health seminars, exhibitions, youth literacy classes, reading groups, correspondence groups, rural theater troupes, and yangko dance teams. Finally, it is reminded that the main work of the club is to organize mass cultural activities, and care should be taken to prevent the formalistic tendency of "national salvation rooms" in some places during the Anti-Japanese War, which had only form but no content. (Editor's note: Forms such as winter schools and people's schools can still be used and it is not necessary to only engage in a single form.)

　　  太行行署指示各地
      组织农村俱乐部
      统一领导社会教育
    【太行电】为提高群众政治觉悟及满足广大翻身农民强烈的文化学习要求，太行行署顷指示各地组织农村俱乐部，加强社会教育工作，要求老区、半老区，甚至新区都要争取一切可能，组织群众学习。社会教育内容，规定为时事、生产、民主建政（结束实际工作进行）及文化教育（应有重点地扫除文盲、进行科学的生产技术教育及反迷信教育）。指示称：过去的冬学及民校形式，已不能适应今天形势的要求，而农村俱乐部则是比较适合的形式。对俱乐部的性质、任务及组织规定如下：（一）俱乐部是农村大众文化教育的集中领导机关，其任务是在村政府领导下，为中心工作开辟道路，针对群众思想进行系统的思想教育；并负责组织村中文化娱乐活动。（二）俱乐部由村政府的教育主任、义务教员、小学教员及聘请热心大众教育与爱好文化娱乐者组织俱乐部委员会，负责经常的组织活动。委员会下设政治教育、文化教育、文化娱乐等部。充分利用广播台、大众黑板、生产技术、医药卫生等座谈会、展览会，及青年补习班、读报组、通讯组、农村剧团、秧歌队等形式进行活动。最后并提请各地注意：俱乐部的主要工作是组织群众性的文化活动，应防止重复抗战时期有些地方的“救亡室”空有形式而无内容的形式主义倾向。（编者按：冬学与民众学校等形式仍可继续采用，不一定单搞一种单一形式。）
