Criticism and Suggestions

To the Editor:
The Wu Yi County Support-the-Front Militia First Battalion has a terrible work style. On the fifteenth of last month, when stationed at Liang Village, No. 7 House, in Gaocheng District, Ji Zhong, they beat a military family member. While cooking, they went to find firewood themselves. A farmer had just bought sorghum stalks to use for medicine, but they found them and insisted on taking them. When refused, they beat three people. While eating, they borrowed a bowl from the village instructor, broke it, and refused to pay for it. When an argument started, they called the instructor a "spy," searched him and found a "Tuoke" pistol case (托盒枪), and beat him up. Before leaving, they also took the instructor away, declaring they would execute him on the road. Village cadres went to our troops to plead, and only then did they get the man back on the road. The grain rations they gave were from 1937. Editor, these militiamen have a terrible work style! Therefore, I suggest that the leaders should not only conduct a strict investigation, criticism, and education, but also publicly apologize to the village.

专栏：批评与建议

　　武邑民兵第一营打骂群众违犯纪律编辑同志：
    武邑县支援前线民兵第一营作风太恶劣。上月十五日在冀中藁城七区良村号房子时打了军属。做饭时自己去找柴，一家农民为煎药而刚买来的秫秸，被他们找到了，一定要拿走，不允，打了三个人。吃饭时借了该村指导员一个碗，打破了，不赔，吵起来，他们说指导员是“特务”，在身上搜出一支托盒枪，便把指导员打了一顿，临走又把指导员带走了，声言在路上枪毙他，村里干部找了咱部队去说了说，才在路上把人要回来。走时给的粮票是三十七年的。编辑同志，这些民兵的作风可太坏了！因此我建议该领导者除应对其严格检查、批评和教育外，并应向该村公开道歉。
