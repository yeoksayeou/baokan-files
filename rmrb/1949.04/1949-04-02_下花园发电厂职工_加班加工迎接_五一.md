　　Xiayuan Power Plant Workers
  　Work Overtime to Greet "May Day"
    [Chahar News] After Wang Wanzhang, the worker representative of the Xuanhua Xiayuan Power Plant, returned to the factory from attending the Zhangxuan Workers' Representative Conference, he held a meeting with five team leaders on the 17th of last month to discuss what actions to take to welcome "May Day." The plant needed to repair a temporary water tower, which required digging ditches and connecting water pipes. Everyone decided to complete this task by voluntarily working overtime outside of the eight-hour workday, and to donate all overtime wages to support the front lines. On the same day, after work, twelve people from the Maintenance Department, led by Wang Wanzhang, began digging ditches. Kang Baocheng, whose one hand was disabled due to work-related injury, also participated in this work without falling behind. After the news spread, workers from the entire plant joined in. The next day, thirty people from the Transportation Department also voluntarily worked overtime. The workers of the Civil Engineering Section and other departments, seeing that all departments were working overtime, but they themselves could not work overtime due to different conditions, gave up their rest on the following day (Sunday) and voluntarily worked overtime for half a day. Within five days, a total of one hundred and fifty-seven people participated, working overtime for two hundred and forty-seven hours, completing a project one meter wide, one and a half meters deep, and over three hundred and ten meters long. In addition, all workers are currently formulating specific production plans to greet "May Day" in order to support the front lines.

  　加班加工迎接“五一”
    【察哈尔讯】宣化下花园发电厂职工代表王万掌，出席张宣职工代表会回厂后，于上月十七日即和五个班长开会酝酿以什么行动来迎接“五一”。该厂要修临时水塔，需挖沟接水管，大家决定在八小时工作以外，自动加班完成这一任务；并将全部加班工资支援前线。当日下午下班后，保修部十二个人在王万掌领导下，开始挖沟。康保诚的一只手因公残废，也不落后的参加了这一工作。消息传出后，全厂工友纷纷参加。第二天，运输部三十人也自动加班。土木股及其他部的工友见各部都加班，而自己却因条件不同不能加班，便于次日（星期日）放弃休息，自动加班半天。五天内共参加一百五十七人，加班二百四十七小时，完成宽一米、深一米五、长达三百一十余米之工程。此外全体工友现正制定迎接“五一”的具体生产计划，以支援前线。
