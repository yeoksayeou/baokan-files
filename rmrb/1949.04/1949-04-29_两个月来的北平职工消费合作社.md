　　The Beiping Workers' Consumer Cooperative in the Past Two Months
    Before liberation, almost every large state-owned enterprise and factory in Beiping had a cooperative organization. These cooperatives could generally be divided into two types: one was sponsored by the factory, providing goods in kind once a month, but only some senior staff and people with "connections" could benefit from this. Workers had no way to access it; the other was sponsored by the puppet trade union, which forcibly deducted a portion of the workers' wages as "shares" when they were paid, and used this money to hoard goods, which were then sold to the workers at slightly lower than market prices every few months. The cooperative could obtain huge profits from this, and its essence was to exploit the workers with their own money. In addition, some cooperative personnel were arrogant, corrupt, and engaged in speculative trading, causing all the funds to disappear without a trace. The workers called this "rotten to the root" and hated it. But this does not mean that workers do not need cooperatives. From the drastic fluctuations in grain prices in Changxindian (for details, see this newspaper on March 4th and 5th), it can be deeply realized that cooperatives organized under the leadership of the People's Government can play a considerable role in combating profiteers and guaranteeing the interests of workers. It is on this basis that the construction of cooperatives in Beiping began.
    (1) Starting to Establish New Cooperatives and Handle Old Ones
    First, the Municipal Supply and Marketing Cooperative and the General Labor Union Cooperation Department decided to: convene comrades from the trade unions and work groups of various factories to discuss the specific issues of establishing cooperatives; then establish a cooperative preparatory committee, absorbing active elements found in this process to participate in the preparatory work. The method of publicity was through comrades in the work group using blackboards, worker newspapers, and oral explanations, and organizing discussions and explanations on cooperative issues in study classes. However, this work was not carried out thoroughly enough in some factories. For example, when the Pingjin Clothing Factory established a cooperative, it only convened a meeting of all factory staff and welfare representatives to explain the economic policies of the New Democracy and the organization and nature of cooperatives, without conducting discussions or mobilizing workers, which should be reviewed. The principle for handling old cooperatives was: the original shares were returned to the workers (the factory's shares were returned to the factory); the houses and utensils were temporarily borrowed by the preparatory committee in its name. Because the accounts of the old cooperatives were generally very chaotic, we implemented the principle of accepting the actual goods (remaining materials) but not the accounts in order to clarify responsibilities. The retention or dismissal of the old personnel was mainly determined based on their relationship with the masses and their work ability. However, some factories failed to fully educate the old personnel and give play to their enthusiasm, causing the old personnel to stand aside and watch, which was a loss.
    (2) Business Operation
    In the past two months (up to April 15th), 40 consumer cooperatives have been established among employees of state-owned enterprises in the city. There are a total of 87,403 members, accounting for 41.5% of the total number of 210,207 employees and their families in state-owned enterprises in the city. Among them, there are 31,116 employee members and 56,287 family members (including 14,645 children aged two to fifteen), and there have been continuous increases recently. In the initial stage of establishment, the share capital was set at 50 yuan per share (later converted to 4.5 jin of millet), and those who joined later paid 5 jin of rice per share. In terms of business operation, the main focus is on supplying members with food, ensuring the lives of workers and their families to a certain extent, and protecting them from the impact of market price fluctuations. The grain company sells to the cooperative at a price 4% lower than the wholesale price. From February 23rd to April 11th, a total of 2,372,174 jin of major food (rice and flour), 613 boxes of daily necessities such as soap, 558 dozens of towels, 115,940 jin of edible salt, and 419,835 jin of oil were supplied. According to the average difference between the wholesale price and the market retail price from March 25th to April 23rd, vermicelli was 2.54 yuan per jin, millet was 0.86 yuan per jin, and corn flour was 0.60 yuan per jin. According to the statistics of the above three kinds of grain from April 4th to April 23rd, the cooperative purchased a total of 485,373 jin of vermicelli, 192,407 jin of millet, and 55,483 jin of corn flour from the trade company (including the cash transaction figures of the cooperative with the trade company), and the cooperative can make a profit of 1,461,607 yuan. Supplying each employee member with 45 jin of grain per month (including 15 jin of refined grain) can enable each person to profit 68.1 yuan; supplying each family member with 35 jin per month (10 jin of refined grain) can enable each person to profit 46.9 yuan. A family of four can save a total of 208.8 yuan per month from intermediate exploitation.
    On the other hand, each cooperative can go to Tianjin, Baoding, Shijiazhuang and other cities or villages to purchase goods on its own through the introduction of the Municipal Supply and Marketing Cooperative, but should ensure that the prices are low and the quality is good to satisfy the members. This is beneficial to regulating the exchange of materials in various places. Generally speaking, the development of business is from simple to complex, starting with staple foods such as grain and coal, and then engaging in non-staple foods and daily necessities.
    (3) Existing Problems and Future Suggestions
    The role of cooperatives in the construction of the New Democratic economy is significant. In the future, it may be the largest mass organization in the country, including hundreds of millions of people, but today our most important work is to try out, explore, and open up this new economic road on the existing basis. The cooperative undertaking in Beiping for two months can give us a general impression that problems are being gradually resolved. For example, in the past, the problem of grain processing was handled by the trade company finding consignment stores to handle it, but the consignment stores sold good goods in the store and replaced them with inferior goods or adulterated them when they were handed over to the cooperative, which made the members dissatisfied. Now the processing is changed to be the responsibility of the cooperative itself (the trade company and the general cooperative introduce reputable electric milling plants), and people are sent to supervise it, which guarantees the quality. In the past, the cooperative had to register and pay before buying grain from the grain company, and it took four or five days to get the physical goods, which also made the members very headache. Later, the trade company and the municipal general cooperative agreed that the cooperative could be given goods on credit in advance, and the accounts would be settled after ten days, and the price would be calculated according to the date of the credit purchase. According to the latest statistics (April 16th to 18th), the cooperative made a profit of 1.6 million yuan; in terms of quality, the cooperative also has the priority of choice. In this way, many problems are gradually being solved. But it is undeniable that there are still some problems that have not been resolved or are not clear.
    (1) Generally, cadres have the idea of relying on trade companies, regarding their business as a store that "helps" the state distribute grain, and they have no initiative (mainly because they are afraid of losing money) and cannot find ways to operate in many ways. Some cooperatives even put the shares paid by the members aside or deposit them in the bank, losing the meaning of the members paying the shares. It must be quickly corrected, and the masses should be thoroughly investigated to find out what things can be done by mobilizing the members. For example, organizing bath and laundry services in factories, and organizing experienced workers' families to produce non-staple foods (such as soy sauce, ground bean curd) and other (such as laundry) production. Retired workers in some factories can be organized into vegetable growing teams, flour milling groups, and sales agents, etc. Everything should revolve around the consumption of members. Only in this way can we truly connect with the members and make them truly realize that this is their own organization. Today, many of our cadres have not been able to organize these businesses that benefit the members, but only calculate there: the trade company should give the cooperative more preferential treatment, this kind of dependence thinking should be eliminated.
    (2) The issue of quality assurance and collection procedures. Because grain is transported in large quantities from other places, it is inevitable that there will be individual cases of poor quality or spoilage. Cooperative cadres should check more carefully when collecting goods. If the cooperative purchases in large quantities and cannot check in detail, if the above situation is found after returning to the cooperative, the grain company should replace it after the person in charge proves that it is true. Also, the grain comes from various different places, resulting in the grain storage being very scattered, and allocation cannot be unified, and the cooperative purchases grain in many varieties, so it is bound to run from the east of the city to the west of the city, forming a large parade of grain, which is a waste of manpower and freight. Currently, the grain company plans to establish a cooperative grain depot, and the location is suitable in the area of Qianmen or Xuanwumen, but there are still many difficulties.
    (3) Capital and "dividend" issues. Generally speaking, five jin of millet per share is indeed too little, not enough for turnover, and it is difficult to even buy daily necessities. The main way to solve this problem is to rely on the masses and everyone to think of ways to operate and obtain profits (of course, it also needs to rely on the support and help of the New Democratic country). This way of solving capital may be slower, but it is very practical. In the past, taking "shareholding dividends" as a slogan was a capitalist cooperative. Because if you want to pay dividends, you are bound to take the road of commercial speculation, and it is impossible to talk about serving the members. The New Democratic cooperative is able to supply members with goods at lower than market prices because it directly transports and sells them itself, and it has the support and preferential treatment of higher-level cooperatives and state trade agencies. The benefits that members get from this transaction will far exceed the value of their shares. This is one reason for not paying dividends. In addition, because the consumer cooperative itself does not generate value at all, if there is a surplus, it is mainly obtained from the support of higher-level cooperatives and the state. Therefore, these surpluses should not be distributed to individual members, but should be accumulated to expand and strengthen the cooperative's business capital. The more sufficient the cooperative's capital, the larger the transaction volume, and the greater the benefits the members will receive, which means that the cooperative has taken a step forward.
    (4) The organization and leadership of the cooperative. In terms of organization, the cooperatives of various factories are led by the Cooperation Department of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, and in terms of business, they are led by the Municipal Supply and Marketing Cooperative. According to different situations, the development of the organizational form of each cooperative can be divided into two categories: the separation of the community affairs committee and the business department, and the consistency of the community affairs committee and the business department. The former is suitable for larger factories: because in addition to supplying members with grain twice a month when wages are paid, there is usually a need for a retail department to meet the needs of members. Therefore, business personnel must leave production to specialize in cooperatives. The community committee focuses on contacting the masses, educating the masses, and guiding business. The latter is because there are fewer workers in the factory (less than 200 people), and if they leave production, it will inevitably affect the work, and the workers themselves are unwilling to do so. Therefore, this type of cooperative can order goods from the supply and marketing cooperative when paying wages. Transportation, purchasing, sales, contacting the masses, and planning business can all be the responsibility of the community committee elected by everyone.
    In order to strengthen the leadership of the employee cooperative, some people have proposed forming a general employee cooperative in order to better and faster solve certain specific problems and correctly guide business. In order to develop the cooperative undertaking of more than 200,000 employees and their families in Beiping City, it is hoped that relevant parties will study this proposal.

　　两个月来的北平职工消费合作社
    解放以前，北平每个较大的公营企业、工厂差不多都有合作社的组织。这些合作社一般可分为两种：一种是由厂方主办，每月进行一次物品配给，但这只有某些高级职员及有“关系”的人物能受惠。工人是无法问津的；另一种是由伪工会主办，在工人发工资时，强行扣下一部分钱，算作“入股”，利用这笔钱囤积货物，隔几个月再把这批货物按稍低于市价售给工人，合作社在其中可取得巨大的利润，其本质是以工人自己的钱剥削工人。加之某些合作社人员的横蛮、贪污、做投机买卖，致使全部资金不知下落，工人们称这个为“连根烂”，无不憎恨。但这并非说明工人们不需要合作社。从长辛店的二次粮价剧烈波动（详情见本报三月四日、五日）中，可以深深地体会到，人民政府领导组织的合作社，可以在打击奸商、保证工人的利益上起到相当作用。就是在这个基础上，北平开始建社工作。
    （一）着手建立新社及处理旧社
    首先由市供销合作总社与总工会合作部决定：召集各厂工会及工作组同志，讨论组社的具体问题；再成立合作社筹委会，吸收在这个过程中所发现的积极分子参加筹备工作。宣传方式是通过工作组同志用黑板报、职工小报、口头讲解，并在学习班上组织对合作问题的讨论及解释。但这个工作，在某些厂做得不够深入。如平津被服厂在建社时仅召开了全厂职员与福利代表会，讲解新民主主义的经济政策，合作社的组织及性质，没有进行讨论，更未发动工人，这是应该检讨的。对旧社的处理原则是：原有的股金，退还给工人（厂方的退给厂方）；房屋用具由筹委会具名暂时借用。因为旧社帐目一般很混乱，我们为明确责任，实行接实（剩余的物资）不接帐。对旧有人员，主要根据与群众的关系及其工作能力决定去留。但有些厂未能充分教育旧有人员，发挥其积极性，致使旧人员站在一旁观望，这是一个损失。
    （二）业务经营情况
    两个月来（截至四月十五日止），全市已在公营企业职工中建立消费合作社四十个。社员共八七四○三人，占全市公营企业职工及其家属之总人数二一○二○七人之百分之四十一点五强。其中职工社员三一一一六人，家属社员五六二八七人（包括两岁至十五岁之小孩一四六四五人），最近并陆续有增加者。股金是在建社初期，规定每股五十元（后折合为小米四斤半），后入股者一律为五斤米。在业务经营上，主要是供应社员粮食，适当保证了工人及其家属生活，不受市场物价波动的影响。粮食公司则按低于批发价百分之四的价格售予合作社。自二月二十三日至四月十一日，共供给主要食品（米面）二三七二一七四斤，日用品肥皂六一三箱，毛巾五五八打，食盐一一五九四○斤，油四一九八三五斤。按三月二十五日至四月二十三日之批发价与市场零售价，平均通粉每斤相差为二元五角四分，小米每斤相差为八角六分，玉米面每斤相差六角。据四月四日至四月二十三日以上三种粮食统计，合作社向贸易公司共购得通粉四八五三七三斤，小米一九二四○七斤，玉米面五五四八三斤（包括合作社向贸易公司之现款交易数字），合作社可获利一四六一六○七元。按每月供给职工社员粮四十五斤（其中细粮十五斤），可使每人获利六十八元一角；家属社员每月三十五斤（细粮十斤），每人可获利四十六元九角。四口之家，每月共可省去中间剥削二百零八元八角。
    另一方面，各社可经过市供销合作总社之介绍，去天津、保定、石家庄及其他城市或乡村自行采购物品，但应保证价廉物美，使社员满意。这对调剂各地物资的交流有一定的好处。一般说，业务的发展是由简至繁，先搞主食品如粮煤等，后搞副食品及日用品。
    （三）目前存在的问题及今后的意见
    合作社在新民主主义经济建设中的作用是重大的。它将来可能是全国最大的，包括几万万人的群众组织，但今天我们最重要的工作，是在现有的基础上试办、探讨与开辟这条新的经济道路。北平两个月的合作事业，可以给我们一个概括的印象，即问题是在逐步解决着。如过去粮食加工的问题是由贸易公司找代销店办理，而代销店在门市上出售的是好货，交给合作社时则换成劣货或掺了假，使社员不满；现在加工改由合作社自己负责（贸易公司和总社介绍有信用的电磨厂），派人监督，这样就保证了质量；过去合作社向粮食公司买粮是先行登记交款，隔上四、五天才能把实物拿到手，这也很使社员头痛，后贸易公司与市总社商定可预先赊给合作社东西，十天后清帐，价格按赊购日计算，据最近这一期（四月十六至十八日）统计，合作社得利达一百六十万元；在质量上，合作社并有选择的优先权。这样，不少问题逐步得到解决。但不可否认，其中仍然存在着一些问题，未得解决或不明确。
    （一）一般干部都存在着依靠贸易公司的思想，把自己的业务看成是“帮助”国家配售粮食的商店，而自己毫无主动性（主要是怕赔钱），不能多方设法经营。有些社竟把社员缴纳的股金放着不动或存入银行，失去了社员缴纳股金的意义。必须迅速纠正，深入群众调查，发现那些事可以发动社员来做。如工厂中办理发、洗澡，组织有经验的工人家属进行副食品（如酱油、磨腐豆）及其他（如洗衣等）生产。某些厂的退休工人则可组织成种菜队，磨面组，以及代客售买等业务，一切应围绕社员消费进行。只有如此，才能真实地联系社员，使社员真正地体会到这是大家自己的组织。今天我们不少干部尚未能组织这些有利这员的业务，而光在那里盘算：贸易公司应该对合作社再优待一点才好，这种依赖思想应该清除。
    （二）关于质量的保证及取货手续的问题。因为粮食是从他处大批运来，其中难免有个别质量较差的或腐坏的情况。合作社干部在取货时应多加检查。若合作社大批购买、无法详细检查时，回社后发现上述情况，由负责人证明属实，粮食公司应予以换取。又粮食来自各个不同的地方，致使粮仓很分散，调拨无法统一，而合作社购粮是多种的，因此势必从东城跑到西城，形成粮食的大游行，很浪费人力及运费。刻粮食公司拟建立合作粮库，地点以在前门或宣武门一带为适中，但其中困难尚多。
    （三）资金和“分红”问题。一般说来，每股五斤小米，的确太少，不够周转，连买日用品都很成问题。解决这个问题主要是依靠群众，依靠大家想办法来经营业务所获得的利润（自然也需要依靠新民主主义国家的扶植和帮助），这种解决资金的办法也许较慢，但是很实在。过去以“入股分红”为号召，是资本主义性质的合作社。因为要分红，就必然走商业投机的道路，根本谈不到为社员服务。而新民主主义的合作社是由于它自己直接运销，并有上级社和国家贸易机关的支持和优待，因此它可以用低于市价的货物供给社员，社员从这种交易中所得到的好处，是会远远地超过他们入股的价值。这是不分红的一个原因。另外，因为消费合作社本身根本不产生价植，如有盈余，主要是从上级社及国家支持所得到的，因此不应该把这些盈余分配给社员个人，而应该全部积蓄起来，以扩大和加强合作社的业务资金。合作社的资金越充足，交易额愈大，社员所得的利益就愈大，这就是说合作社向上提高了一步。
    （四）合作社的组织领导问题。各厂社在组织上受市总工会合作部的领导，业务上受市供销合作总社领导。根据不同的情况，各社组织形式的发展可分为两类：社务委员会与营业部分离及社务委员会与营业部一致。前者适合于较大的工厂：因为除每月两次发工资时供给社员粮食外，在平时每需要门市部，以满足社员需要。因此，营业人员就必须脱离生产专搞合作社。社委会则以联系群众，教育群众及指导业务为中心工作。后者因厂内工人较少（二百人以下），如脱离生产，必然影响工作，且工人自己亦不愿如此做，所以这类社在发工资时可到供销总社订货。运购、售卖、联系群众、计划业务，可统由大家选出之社委负责。
    为加强职工合作社的领导，有人提出组成职工合作总社，以便更好和更快地解决某些具体问题，正确的指导业务，为了开展北平市二十余万职工及其家属的合作事业，希有关方面研究这个建议。
