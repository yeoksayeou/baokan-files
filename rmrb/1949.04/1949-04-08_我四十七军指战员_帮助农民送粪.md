　　Soldiers and Commanders of the 47th Army
  　Help Peasants Deliver Manure
    [This Newspaper Reported] The 47th Army of the People's Liberation Army helped villagers in their garrison area deliver manure and haul soil. The regimental commander of the 421st Regiment personally took the lead in carrying manure. The 141st Division organized all logistical personnel and carts to deliver manure. All the cadres and soldiers of the 5th Company of the 23rd Battalion, in just two hours of free time, delivered seven carts of manure and hauled nine carts of soil for military dependents and poor peasants, and cultivated twenty mu of land. Each "agricultural assistance group" of the 17th Battalion went to the homes of martyrs, military personnel, and workers to haul manure as soon as it dawned. The groups competed with each other, and just four groups delivered a total of thirty-five carts of manure in one day. They didn't even bother the villagers for drinking water during their work, but boiled it themselves. The villagers were so moved that they said: This is truly our people's army! It's good enough if the "white necks" (referring to the Chiang bandit army) were here and didn't cause trouble, let alone carry manure and haul soil for you!

　　我四十七军指战员
  　帮助农民送粪
    【本报讯】解放军四十七军，帮助驻地村民送粪拉土。四二一团团长亲自带头挑粪。一四一师组织了所有的勤杂人员和车马送粪。二三大队五连全部干部战士，仅在自由活动两点钟的时间，就给军属和贫苦农民送了七车粪、拉了九车土，种了二十亩地。一七大队各“助耕小组”，天一亮就都到分配好的烈、军、工属家去拉粪，各组互相竞赛，仅四个组一天共送粪三十五车。在工作中连口水也不麻烦老乡，自己烧。感动得老乡们说：真是咱人民的军队，团长都给咱挑粪！要是“白脖”（指蒋匪军）在这里，不找事已经是好的，别说还给你挑粪拉土！
