Children in Beiping Celebrate the Holiday
　　Eighteen Cinemas Provide Free Admission to Children; Parks and Scenic Spots Open for Children to Visit
[Our dispatch] Today (April 4th), the 400,000 children of Beiping celebrate their first holiday after liberation. Under the leadership of the Children's Corps Preparatory Committee, over 100,000 children in the city will collectively participate in today's celebrations. Apart from the children in the suburbs celebrating separately, children over ten years old in the city will gather in twenty-one locations for celebrations. Eighteen cinemas will screen famous films such as "Rainbow" to provide free admission to children, while three locations will host entertainment programs by performing arts troupes and children. Today, Zhongshan Park, Beihai Park, and the Palace Museum will be open to welcome children to visit. The Beiping Liberation Daily and the Dazhong Daily will publish special commemorative issues. The Beiping People's Radio will also broadcast celebration programs from 6:45 PM to 7:30 PM this afternoon and evening. This is an unprecedented event in the children's community of Beiping. Last year, when the Kuomintang bandit gang ruled Beiping, they superficially embellished this festival, with only 470 children participating in health competitions. Now, the gates of various cinemas, parks, and scenic spots are wide open to tens of thousands of out-of-school and impoverished children. Moreover, in addition to the more than 70 after-school night schools already established by the People's Government in various districts, the "Three Loves Movement" of loving learning, loving labor, and loving the New Democratic New China will be promoted in the future to cultivate new children for the New China. Yesterday, all primary schools in the city held celebration meetings. More than 600 primary school students from the Sixth District Central Primary School gathered to celebrate, performing newly learned Yangko dances such as "Brother and Sister Reclaiming Wasteland" and "Husband and Wife Learning to Read," and singing 32 programs including "The Kuomintang is a Complete Mess." They also elected model heroes in the school's cleaning campaign, which shows that the newly liberated children of Beiping are advancing rapidly. When the famous Rongzhen Primary School in North China held a carnival, four-year-old Ren Yanxi from the kindergarten conducted a choir of children aged three to five, which shows that the children in the old liberated areas are being fully nurtured and developing their intelligence.

　　平市儿童欢度节日
    十八家电影院免费招待儿童　公园名胜开放让小朋友参观
    【本报讯】今日（四月四日），平市四十万儿童欢度他们解放后的第一个节日。在儿童团筹委会领导下，市内将有十万以上儿童集体参加今日的庆祝活动。除市郊儿童另行庆祝外，市内各区十岁以上的儿童，将分二十一处集会庆祝，十八处电影院放映名片“虹”等，免费招待儿童，三处则由文工团及儿童表演游艺节目。今日中山公园、北海公园、故宫博物馆将开放招待儿童游览，北平解放报及大众日报将出特刊纪念，北平人民电台昨今两日下午六时四十五分至七时三十分并广播庆祝节目，这是北平儿童界的创举。去年国民党匪帮统治北平时，曾演戏式地点缀过这佳节，只有四百七十个儿童参加了健康比赛；而现在则各电影院和公园名胜的大门向数万失学的贫苦儿童畅开着，而且，人民政府除在各区已举办七十多补习夜校外，今后并将推行爱学习、爱劳动、爱新民主主义新中国的“三爱运动”，以培养新中国的新儿童。昨日全市各小学，举行庆祝大会，第六区中心小学六百多小学生集会庆祝，表演了新学的秧歌舞“兄妹开荒”、“夫妻识字”，合唱“国民党一团糟”等三十二个节目，并选举了校内清洁运动中的模范英雄，这表示着新解放的北平儿童正在飞快地前进着。华北有名的荣臻小学开游艺会时，幼稚园的四岁儿童任燕西指挥一队三岁至五岁的儿童合唱队，这表示了老解放区的儿童是充分被培养并发展着他们的智能。
