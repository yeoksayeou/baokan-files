　　Joyfully Hearing of the Liberation of Nanjing and Taiyuan
  　The People of Yulin Eagerly Await Our Army
    [Broadcast by Beiping Xinhua Broadcasting Station on the 29th] The people of Yulin City, northern Shaanxi, are eagerly awaiting the arrival of the People's Liberation Army. On the 24th of this month, many workers, students, staff, and citizens of Yulin City heard the news of the liberation of Nanjing and Taiyuan from the broadcast of the Beiping Xinhua Broadcasting Station. At that time, everyone was overjoyed and said one after another: "Nanjing and Taiyuan have been liberated, the Kuomintang is finished, and the liberation of Yulin is not far away!" The lower-ranking officers and soldiers of the Kuomintang army's 22nd Army, which remains in Yulin, are very disappointed with the Kuomintang's anti-government refusal to sign the peace agreement. They privately discussed that Nanjing and Taiyuan have been liberated, so what is little Yulin? It is better to accept Chairman Mao's eight peace terms sooner rather than later, to save everyone from suffering.

　　欣闻南京太原解放
  　榆林人民渴盼我军
    【北平新华广播电台二十九日广播】陕北榆林城人民热烈期待解放军到达，本月二十四号榆林城的许多工人学生职员和市民，从北平新华广播电台的广播中听到南京、太原解放的消息，当时大家都欢喜万分，纷纷地说：“南京太原都解放了，国民党完蛋了，榆林的解放也不远了！”残存在榆林的国民党军二十二军的下级官兵，对于国民党反对政府拒绝签订和平协定感到非常失望。他们私相议论说，南京、太原都解放了，小小的榆林还算个啥，不如早一点接受毛主席的八项和平条件，免得大家受累。
