Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 21st: The full text of the Domestic Peace Agreement (Final Amendment), submitted by the CCP delegation to the Nanjing government delegation on April 15 after half a month of negotiations and rejected by the Nanjing government on April 20, is as follows:

In the 35th year of the Republic of China, the Nanjing National Government, with the help of the US government, violated the will of the people, undermined the ceasefire agreement and the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference, and launched a nationwide domestic war against the Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army in the name of opposing the Chinese Communist Party. This war has lasted for two years and nine and a half months. The people of the whole country have suffered greatly as a result. The country's financial and material resources have suffered enormous losses, and the country's sovereignty has suffered new damage. The people of the whole country have consistently expressed dissatisfaction with the Nanjing National Government's violation of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary Three People's Principles, Dr. Sun Yat-sen's correct policies of alliance with Russia, alliance with the Communist Party, and assistance to farmers and workers, and Dr. Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary last will. The people of the whole country especially oppose the Nanjing National Government's launch of this unprecedented domestic war and the resulting erroneous policies and measures in politics, military affairs, finance, economy, culture, and diplomacy. The Nanjing National Government has completely lost the trust of the people of the whole country. And in this domestic war, the Nanjing National Government's army has been defeated by the People's Liberation Army led by the Chinese Communist Party and commanded by the Chinese People's Revolutionary Military Commission. Based on the above situation, the Nanjing National Government proposed to the Chinese Communist Party on January 1, 38th year of the Republic of China, to hold negotiations to stop the domestic war and restore a state of peace. The Chinese Communist Party issued a statement on January 14 of the same year, agreeing to the above proposal of the Nanjing National Government, and proposed to punish war criminals, abolish the pseudo-constitution, abolish the pseudo-legal system, reorganize all reactionary troops according to democratic principles, confiscate bureaucratic capital, implement land reform, abolish traitorous treaties, and convene a new Political Consultative Conference without reactionary elements to establish a democratic united government to take over all the powers of the Nanjing Kuomintang reactionary government and its subordinate governments at all levels as the basis for peace negotiations between the two sides. These eight basic conditions have been agreed to by the Nanjing National Government. Therefore, the Chinese Communist Party and the Nanjing National Government sent their own delegations, authorized with full powers to hold negotiations and sign agreements. Representatives of both sides gathered in Beiping, first confirming that the Nanjing National Government should bear full responsibility for this domestic war and its various erroneous policies, and agreed to establish this agreement.

  　Article 1

    Section 1: In order to distinguish right from wrong and determine responsibility, the Chinese Communist Party delegation and the Nanjing National Government delegation (hereinafter referred to as both parties) confirm that the war criminals of the Nanjing National Government who are responsible for launching and executing this domestic war must, in principle, be punished, but should be handled separately according to the following circumstances:

    Item 1: All war criminals, no matter who they are, if they can recognize right from wrong, repent sincerely, have factual performance, and are conducive to the advancement of the Chinese people's liberation cause and to solving domestic problems by peaceful means, shall be allowed to cancel their war criminal status and be given lenient treatment.

    Item 2: All war criminals, no matter who they are, who are obstinate and do not repent, hinder the advancement of the people's liberation cause, are not conducive to solving domestic problems by peaceful means, or even instigate rebellion, shall be severely punished. Those who lead troops to rebel shall be put down by the Chinese People's Revolutionary Military Commission.

    Section 2: Both parties confirm that the Nanjing National Government's declaration of innocence for Okamura Neiji, a Japanese general and war criminal of the war of aggression against China, on January 26, 38th year of the Republic of China, and its permission to send 260 other Japanese war criminals back to Japan on January 31 of the same year were wrong. These Japanese war criminals should be re-examined once the Chinese Democratic United Government, which represents the new central government of the entire Chinese people, is established.

  　Article 2

    Section 3: Both parties confirm that the "Constitution of the Republic of China" passed by the "National Assembly" convened by the Nanjing Kuomintang government in November of the 35th year of the Republic of China should be abolished.

After the signing of the Domestic Peace Agreement, a national reorganization committee should be established immediately to be responsible for this reorganization work. The reorganization committee shall have seven to nine members, with four to five members sent by the People's Revolutionary Military Commission and three to four members sent by the Nanjing National Government, with one member sent by the People's Revolutionary Military Commission as the chairman and one member sent by the Nanjing National Government as the vice-chairman. In the areas reached and taken over by the People's Liberation Army, regional reorganization committee branches may be established as needed. The ratio of the number of people on both sides of this branch and the sharing of the chairman and vice-chairman are the same as those of the national reorganization committee. Separate reorganization committees should be established for the reorganization of the navy and air force. All matters relating to the People's Liberation Army's advance into and takeover of the areas currently under the jurisdiction of the Nanjing National Government shall be stipulated by order of the Chinese People's Revolutionary Military Commission. When the People's Liberation Army advances, the armed forces of the Nanjing National Government shall not resist.

The reorganization principle should be to incorporate the above-mentioned army troops that have been concentrated and reorganized into the regular troops of the People's Liberation Army in accordance with the democratic system and regular organization of the People's Liberation Army. The old, weak, and disabled among the soldiers who have been verified and must be discharged, and who voluntarily retire, and the officers who voluntarily retire or change careers, shall be handled by the reorganization committee and its branches, providing them with the convenience of returning home and living arrangements, so that they can all be in their proper positions and not be unemployed and have bad behavior.

    【新华社北平二十一日电】经过半个月谈判，四月十五日由中共代表团提交南京政府代表团，四月二十日被南京政府所拒绝的国内和平协定（最后修正案），全文如下：
    中华民国三十五年，南京国民政府在美国政府帮助之下，违背人民意志，破坏停战协定及政治协商会议的决议，在反对中国共产党的名义之下，向中国人民及中国人民解放军发动全国规模的国内战争。此项战争，至今已达两年又九个半月之久。全国人民，因此蒙受了极大的灾难。国家财力物力遭受了极大的损失，国家主权亦遭受了新的损害。全国人民，对于南京国民政府违背孙中山先生的革命三民主义的立场，违背孙中山先生的联俄、联共及扶助农工等项正确的政策，以及违背孙中山先生的革命的临终遗嘱，历来表示不满。全国人民对于南京国民政府发动此次空前规模的国内战争以及由此而采取的政治、军事、财政、经济、文化、外交等项错误的政策及措施，尤其表示反对。南京国民政府在全国人民中业已完全丧失信任。而在此次国内战争中，南京国民政府的军队，业已为中国共产党所领导、为中国人民革命军事委员会所指挥的人民解放军所战败。基于上述情况，南京国民政府曾于中华民国三十八年一月一日向中国共产党提议举行停止国内战争恢复和平状态的谈判。中国共产党曾于同年一月十四日发表声明，同意南京国民政府上项提议，并提议以惩办战争罪犯，废除伪宪法，废除伪法统，依据民主原则改编一切反动军队，没收官僚资本，实行土地改革，废除卖国条约，召集没有反动分子参加的新的政治协商会议成立民主联合政府接收南京国民党反动政府及其所属各级政府的一切权力等八项条件为双方举行和平谈判的基础，此八项基础条件已为南京国民政府所同意。因此，中国共产党方面和南京国民政府方面派遣自己的代表团，授以举行谈判和签订协定的全权。双方代表于北平集会，首先确认南京国民政府应对于此次国内战争及其各项错误政策担负全部责任，并同意成立本协定。
