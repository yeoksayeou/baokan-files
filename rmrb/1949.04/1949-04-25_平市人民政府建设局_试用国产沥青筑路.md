　　Ping City People's Government Construction Bureau
　　Trial Use of Domestically Produced Asphalt for Road Building

　　[This Newspaper's Report] The Ping City People's Government Construction Bureau, in order to promote the use of domestically produced asphalt for road construction, recently obtained two types of soft and hard asphalt samples, by arrangement with the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company, as by-products of coking.  It is conducting on-site road construction and laboratory tests, respectively, for further experimentation. Based on the experience of skilled workers, combined with the technical guidance of municipal engineering personnel, asphalt concrete and asphalt macadam road surfaces are being tested on the eastern section of East Chang'an Street in the city. The work began on the 20th and is still in progress.  The laboratory tests are conducted using scientific methods to analyze the properties of the asphalt. Arrangements have been made for the Materials Testing Laboratory of the North China Highway Administration Bureau to handle this.  It can also begin within days.  After these two tests are completed, it is expected that good results will be obtained for the use of domestically produced asphalt for road construction.
