Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains, 13th. More than 13,000 employees of the Longhai Railway enthusiastically support the People's Liberation Army's southward advance. Starting in early February, railway workers across the line began repairing the railway in sections to ensure traffic safety and increase travel speed. The completion time for this work in each section was advanced by a quarter to a half compared to the time previously required. In seven days, the 74 workers of the Lanfeng Engineering Section completed the task of replacing 1,406 sleepers and 95 bent rails, and laying 2,000 meters of track. Work efficiency was doubled compared to the past. More than 30 employees of the Yancheng Engineering Section voluntarily extended their working hours by two hours, and repaired a 200-meter-long military platform at the station in seven days under extremely scarce material conditions. Employees of the Xuchang East Station Engineering Section tried to find materials and added a new 500-meter-long track, which greatly facilitated transportation. Employees of the Zhengzhou, Kaifeng, Xuzhou, Yancheng and other locomotive sections overcame various difficulties and rushed to repair 15 damaged locomotives and more than 300 passenger and freight cars that had been abandoned for several years in a short period of time, which were used to transport the southbound army. The Yancheng Locomotive Section repaired a 20-ton water tower's water pump in ten days, which solved the problem of locomotives adding water in the Zhengzhou-Yancheng section. As the number of trains increased and there were not enough station duty and traffic personnel to be assigned, the Zhengzhou employees worked overtime voluntarily regardless of fatigue. The 24 employees of the Yancheng Traffic Section voluntarily divided themselves into two shifts, doing the work that used to be done by 60 people in three shifts. The loading and unloading workers completed their tasks one hour ahead of schedule each time, and voluntarily reduced the loading and unloading price of a large amount of military supplies from eight catties of white flour per ton to three catties of millet, in order to reduce government expenditure. With the concerted efforts of the employees across the line, the first phase of the Longhai Railway's military transport mission was gradually completed victoriously.

　　陇平铁路分段整修
  　职工紧张工作自动加班
  　保障南下大军行车安全
    【新华社中原十三日电】陇平铁路一万三千余员工热烈支援人民解放军南进。从二月上旬起，全路铁道工人即分段进行整修工作，以保障行车安全和提高行车速率。各段此项工作均较过去所需时间提前四分之一到二分之一完成。兰封工务支段七十四名工人七天内即完成抽换枕木一千四百零六根和弯曲铁轨九十五根，铺道二千公尺的任务。工作效率较过去提高一倍。郾城工务段三十余员工自动将工作时间延长两小时，在器材极端缺乏的条件下七天修竣该站二百公尺长的军用站台。许昌东站工务段员工则设法搜寻材料，加铺了一条长五百公尺的新轨，大大便利了运输。郑州、开封、徐州、郾城等地的机务段员工更克服种种困难，在短期内抢修好已废置数年的破损机车十五辆、客货车三百余辆，用以运送南下大军。郾城机务段十天修好二十吨水塔的吸水机一部，解决了郑郾段机车添水的困难。由于车次增多，车站值班和行车人员不够分配，郑州员工们就不顾疲劳，自动加班。郾城车务段二十四人自动分为两班，做了过去六十人分为三班的工作。装卸工人每次都提前一小时完成任务，并自动将大量军用物资的装卸价格从每吨白面八斤降为小米三斤，以减少政府开支。在全路员工一致努力下，陇平铁路第一阶段的军运任务逐步胜利完成。
