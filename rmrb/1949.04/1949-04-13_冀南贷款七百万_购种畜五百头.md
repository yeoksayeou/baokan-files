　　Ji'nan Loans Seven Million
  　To Purchase Five Hundred Head of Breeding Stock
    [Ji'nan Telegram] In order to realize the livestock development plan, the Ji'nan Administrative Office has issued loans of RMB 7 million to purchase 500 head of breeding stock, which will be distributed to each special district (100 per district) for continuous breeding. Regarding purchase, transportation, and feeding methods, the Administrative Office, on March 20, instructed each special commissioner's office to formulate specific plans based on the conditions of the counties under its jurisdiction. The Production Promotion Cooperative should organize reliable livestock dealers and the masses to exchange cloth for livestock in Zhangbei or along the Yellow River. Before the breeding stock is transported back, the county construction section should be responsible for organizing and finding suitable feeding households, so that after the livestock dealers return, both parties can freely negotiate prices and complete the transactions. The instructions emphasize purchasing and transporting breeding cattle, while breeding donkeys can be purchased and transported as needed. It is strictly forbidden to purchase from areas where livestock epidemics are prevalent to avoid infection. The instructions finally stipulate that half of this work should be completed before the end of May, and efforts should be made to complete all of it by the end of July, in order to meet the needs of increased production. In addition, the Ji'nan Agricultural Supply Cooperative is instructed to purchase ten head of breeding stock and directly manage the feeding, hygiene, and breeding of the breeding stock for demonstration purposes, and to experiment with jointly operated cattle breeding stations with farmers to gain experience for promotion.

  　购种畜五百头
    【冀南电】为实现发展牲畜计划，冀南行署发贷人民币七百万，准备购买种畜五百头，分至每专区各百头进行经常配殖。关于购运、饲养等办法，行署于三月二十日，指出各专署按所辖各县情况具体计划，由生产推进社组织可靠的牲畜贩子及群众到张北或黄河两岸以布易畜。在种畜贩回前，应由县建设科负责组织与找妥饲养户，以便畜贩回来后，即由双方议价自由成交。指示提出以购运种牛为主，种驴可按需要购运一部。严禁到流行畜疫地区购买，以避免传染。指示最后规定：此次工作要在五月底以前完成一半，七月底争取全部完成，以应增产需要。此外，并责成冀南农业供应社购买种畜十头，直接经营种畜的饲养、卫生、配种以作示范，并实验与农民合营耕牛配种站，取得经验，以资推广。
