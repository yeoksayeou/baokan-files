　　Xiayuan Power Plant Workers
  　Work Overtime to Greet May Day
    [Ping City News] The workers of Xiayuan Power Plant, responding to the call of the Zhangxuan Conference, decided to greet May Day with practical actions. Starting from the 17th of last month, everyone spontaneously initiated overtime production in various labor activities for repairing the temporary water tower (digging ditches, connecting water pipes, etc.) and decided to use the wages earned from overtime to support the front lines. Kang Shoucheng of the Maintenance Department, whose one hand had been disabled due to work, did not fall behind in his work despite having only one hand. Thirty people from the Transportation Department voluntarily worked overtime for one hour and completed more than 30 meters of ditch in one day. Workers from the Civil Engineering Section and other departments, due to objective conditions that prevented them from working overtime, gave up their rest on Sundays and voluntarily worked overtime for half a day. According to five-day statistics, a total of 152 people participated, working a total of 242 hours, thus completing the huge project of digging a ditch one meter wide, one and a half meters deep, and 310 meters long. Currently, all workers are formulating specific production plans to welcome "May Day."

　　下花园发电厂职工
  　加班生产迎接五一
    【平市讯】下花园发电厂职工响应张宣会议号召，决以实际行动来迎接五一劳动节。从上月十七日开始，在修临时水塔的各种劳动（挖沟接水管等）中，大家自动发起加班生产。并决定将加班所得工资支援前线。保修部的康守诚一手已因公残废，只有一只手，工作并不落后。运输部三十人自动加班一小时，一天完成了三十余米沟。土木股及其他部的工友，因客观条件不能加班，即在星期日放弃休息，自动加班半天。五天统计，共参加者一五二人共作二四二小时，即全部完成宽一米深一米半长达三一○米之巨大工程。现全体工友正在制定迎接“五一”的具体生产计划。
