Problems in the Mining of the Yangquan Iron Mine

To guarantee the fulfillment of the 1949 Yangquan public and private pig and wrought iron furnace production plan, a supply of ××10,000 tons of iron ore raw materials is required. However, according to surveys and estimates from 96 iron mine villages in Meng County, Pinyin County, and Yangquan City, the iron ore production falls far short of the demand. Therefore, the existing problems in iron ore mining must be resolved.

In the past, it was one-sidedly believed that once the ironware furnaces were up and running, iron ore production would naturally be driven, which led to insufficient efforts in solving difficulties and providing necessary assistance to the iron ore kilns, causing many already-mined iron ore kilns to collapse. According to incomplete statistics from Yangquan City, 48 iron ore kilns have been shut down. Although four new iron ore kilns were added and two old kilns were restored in the Fourth District in January of this year, and seven new kilns were added in the Third District, the total daily increase in iron ore production of 51 tons is still far from meeting the demand. Therefore, public and private iron furnaces frequently compete to purchase iron ore, and public iron furnaces forcibly demand supply through administrative organs. When iron prices are high, mine owners adulterate the ore, raise prices, and hoard it. When prices are low, private iron furnaces use inferior rice as payment, causing losses to the mining workers. These mining iron ore kilns are all privately operated in cooperation. All laborers participating in mining, regardless of age or skill, are counted as one share, and everyone is responsible for profits and losses. Each kiln typically has six or seven people; the largest, Taihe Kiln in Yangquan City, has 27 people. Such cooperative mining kilns account for more than 90%. There are very few family-run mining operations (commonly known as "father and son teams"), such as the Tonghuashu Kiln in Beiyangjia Village, Yangquan City, where a father and his two sons mine, extract, and sell the ore themselves. A common characteristic of these two types of operations is that they do not accumulate capital; they distribute whatever they earn and adopt primitive production methods. When mining begins, they rely on their own resources, buying simple production tools such as ropes, cages, and explosives. If they do not find a ore vein (iron ore veins are mostly pocket-shaped, unlike coal seams), they will lose money. The wages of iron ore miners are very low. For example, in the 25 mining kilns in the Third District of Yangquan City, the average wage is just over three catties and three taels of rice per person per day, with the highest being five catties and ten taels, and the lowest being one catty and two taels. Many workers feel that it is better to be a coal miner, so they have switched careers and stopped working. Of the 45 iron ore kilns in the district, 27 had stopped work by last winter.

Secondly, the vast mining area of 4,360 square kilometers in Yangquan City, Meng County, Pinyin County, and Xiyang County lacks appropriate transportation and transportation lines, resulting in high transportation costs and ore prices in remote areas, and low transportation costs and ore prices in nearby areas. Purchasers of ore are bound to compete to buy ore from nearby mines, making it difficult to sell ore from remote mines. Furthermore, because some ore purchasers do not calculate transportation costs according to mileage, it is even more impossible to promote the development of mining production.

Thirdly, there is indiscriminate mining without long-term planning, and this method of mining is very destructive. According to mining custom, the distance between mine entrances is fifty, eighty, or one hundred steps. But now, in an ancient tomb mining field in Shangzhangzhao Village, the mine entrances are as dense as honeycombs, and everyone rushes to dig once someone discovers a ore outcrop. Workers from the four villages of Xitoucen, Dongyujing, Beitoucen, and Pubei compete for mining in the intersecting mining field, which frequently leads to disputes. The above problems seriously affect the mining of iron ore kilns and must be resolved by the leadership. Therefore, we would like to offer a few suggestions for relevant parties to consider.

1.  It must be made clear that the development of iron smelting and the development of iron ore mining are inseparable, and neglecting one aspect will lead to failure. To ensure the completion of the pig and wrought iron industry production plan, the leadership over the development of iron ore production must be strengthened. It is necessary to pilot the establishment of an iron ore mining and marketing cooperative under the city's Cooperative Supply and Marketing General Society to uniformly lead the solution of tool supply problems in iron ore mining, guide mining methods, make overall plans, establish mutual supply relationships with wrought iron furnaces, reduce intermediate exploitation by merchants, overcome the imbalance of fluctuating ore and rice prices and the phenomenon of mutual manipulation, and gradually move towards mutual cooperation in production.

2.  The government should promptly formulate measures for mining area management and protection, rewards and penalties, and determination of mining rights, to overcome unplanned and destructive mining and improve production organization forms. First, the establishment of a mining kiln must be submitted to the government for approval (at least through the district). The distance between mine entrances should be determined: 50 steps for a pit, 100 steps for a shaft, and 30 steps for a visible entrance. Since the ore-rich areas near forbidden mountains and temples are most likely to cause disputes during mining, state-owned or joint ventures with local people should be adopted for planned mining. If the masses mine on their own, in addition to obtaining approval, a detailed survey should be conducted to delineate boundaries. If it is found that there is no long-term plan and only mining is done, regardless of mine construction, it should be stopped. Those who mine in accordance with the above principles should be rewarded according to their achievements to encourage large-scale mining, with emphasis on the restoration of old iron ore kilns, and then planned and focused assistance to new mining kilns.

3.  Transportation construction and the improvement of transportation tools play a huge role in developing iron ore, reducing costs, increasing production, and saving labor, especially in this mountainous area. This should be vigorously addressed. The government is planning to repair the old highway from Jucheng, Pinyin County, to Yangquan, and the road from Sanquan Village to Yangquan City, and to repair several branch lines. However, the repair costs for these roads, in addition to the mobilization of civilian labor by Yangquan City, will require subsidies from the North China Government (already requested) to be completed.

4.  It is very necessary to provide investment, loans, and other assistance to iron ore mining through the National Bank (even better if combined with the Supply and Marketing Cooperative). Investment and loans can mainly be in the form of tools and food, and help mining kilns accumulate capital and expand production. The Yangquan office of the People's Bank of China has planned to issue loans for 1,000 small handcarts, and also plans to issue loans for adding 500 large carts and 500 livestock. At present, it has helped the masses to borrow money to buy more than 60 livestock. It is also a method for state-owned iron factories to pilot loans, investments, and the purchase of iron ore.

### 阳泉铁矿开采中的问题

　　阳泉铁矿开采中的问题
    要保证一九四九年阳泉公私生熟铁炉生产计划的完成，必须有××万吨铁矿原料的供给，但据盂县、平定、阳泉市九十六个铁矿村庄的调查估计，所出铁矿和要求相离甚远。因此铁矿开采上现存的问题必须加以解决。
    过去片面认为铁业成品炉搞起来了，铁矿生产自然也就会带动起来，致使给铁矿窑解决困难和必要的扶助作得不够，因而引起很多已经开采的铁矿窑走向垮台。据阳泉市不完全统计，即有四十八座铁矿窑停顿下来；今年一月虽四区新增铁矿窑四座、恢复旧窑两座，三区新增七座，每日共增产铁矿五十一吨，但亦供不应求，因此经常发生公私铁炉争购铁矿现象，而公营铁炉则通过行政机构强要供给。铁货行情高时，矿主则在矿内掺假抬价，囤积不售；行情低时，私营铁炉则以劣米抵价，让开采工人受到损失。这些开采的铁矿窑，均系私人合作开办，凡参加开采的劳力工人，不分老幼、技术好坏均算一股，赔赚大家负责，每座窑普通有六、七人，最大的阳泉市太和窑有二十七人，此种合营开采的窑约占百分之九十以上；家族经营开采的（俗称父子班），为数很少，如阳泉市北阳家庄的同花树窑，父子兄弟三人开采，自采自卖。这两种经营共同的特点，均不积累资金，赚多少分多少，采用原始的生产方式。初开采时，吃自己的，各人买些绳笼炮药等简单的生产工具，碰不到矿脉（铁矿脉多系窝状，与煤层不同）同要赔本。采铁矿工人的工资很低，如阳泉市三区二十五座矿窑，平均每人每日三斤三两多米，最高者五斤十两，最低一斤二两。许多工人感到不如当煤矿工人，纷纷转业停工，该区四十五座铁矿窑至去冬停工的则有二十七座。
    其次，阳泉市、盂县、平定、昔阳四千三百六十方公里的漫长矿区，没有适当的交通工具和交通线，造成了远处运费高，矿价高，近处运费低，矿价低的现象，购矿户势必争购近矿，远矿则不易出售。再由于有的购矿主开支运费不按里程计算，更不能推进采矿生产的发展。
    再就是采矿时争刨，不作长期打算，这种开采方法破坏性很大。按开采习惯，矿口与矿口之间的距离，有五十步八十步百步者；而现在上章召村一个古坟矿田，矿口密如蜂窝，一人发现矿苗，别人争刨。西头岑、东峪井、北头岑、铺北四村交界矿田，四村工人争刨，经常发生纠纷。以上问题，严重影响铁矿窑开采，必须从领导上加以解决，因此，我们特提出几点意见，供有关方面参考。
    一、要明确发展炼铁与发展铁矿开采是密不可分的，放松一面即会遭到失败。为了保证生熟铁业生产计划的完成，对铁矿生产的发展，必须加强领导。需要在市合作供销总社下试办铁矿开采供销社，统一领导解决铁矿开采中的工具供给问题，指导开采方法，通盘筹划，与熟铁炉建立互相供应关系，减少商人中间剥削，克服矿价米价时高时低的不平衡及互相操纵的现象，逐步走向生产上的互相合作。
    二、由政府迅速制订矿区管理保护、惩奖与确定矿权等办法，克服无计划破坏性的开采，改进生产组织形式。首先开矿窑必须呈请政府批准（最低经区）。矿口与矿口之间的距离，确定坑五十步，井一百步，口见口三十步。由于禁山、神庙附近储藏量丰富的矿区，开采时最易引起纠纷，应有计划的采取公营或与当地群众合营开采；如群众自行开采时，除经过批准外，应详细勘查，划清界限。如发现无长期打算只图采矿，而不顾矿井建设者，应予停止。合乎上述原则开采的，根据成绩，给予奖励，鼓励大量开采，着重旧铁矿窑的恢复，再有计划有重点的帮助新辟矿窑。
    三、交通建设与运输工具的改进，在开发铁矿、减低成本、增加产量、节省人力上作用巨大，尤其此地山路崎岖，应予大力解决。政府正拟修补平定县巨城至阳泉的旧有公路，阳泉三泉村至阳泉市的路，亦拟修筑，并整修若干支线。但这些路程的修补费用，除阳泉市动员民工而外，还需华北政府的补助（已请示）才能完成。
    四、通过国家银行（与供销社结合更好）对铁矿开采上进行投资、贷款等扶助，十分必要。投资贷款可采用工具、食粮等实物为主，并帮助矿窑积累资金，扩大生产。中国人民银行阳泉办事处，已拟发放一千辆人推小车的贷款，并计划发放增加大车五百辆、牲口五百头的贷款，目前已帮助群众贷款买牲口六十余头。又公营铁厂试行贷款、投资、收购铁矿也是办法。（石家庄分社）
