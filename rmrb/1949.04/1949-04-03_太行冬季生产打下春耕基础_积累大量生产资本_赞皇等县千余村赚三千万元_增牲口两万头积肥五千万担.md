Taihang Electric News: The winter production in Taihang has made direct preparations for this year's spring plowing. From December of last year to February of this year, in the past three months, the winter production in the entire region has achieved great results. According to incomplete statistics from various regions, the sideline production of transportation, weaving, and oil pressing in 1,124 villages in 24 counties including Licheng, Cixian, Xiuwu, Xiangyuan, Xiyang, Changzhi, Pingshun, and Huixian, has generated a total profit of over 30,079,000 yuan (RMB), plus over 2,098 shi of rice. In addition to directly subsidizing the people's living rations, most of this production income was used for reinvestment in production. With the support of some loans and the organization of public idle capital, a large number of livestock have been added in various places since last winter. According to statistics from 1,259 villages in 19 counties including Licheng, Shahe, Zanhuang, Heshun, Zuoquan, Linxian, Wu'an, Wuxiang, and Lucheng, the number of livestock has increased by 24,204, an average increase of about 18 livestock per village. Baicaoping Village in Zanhuang County suffered a poor autumn harvest, and the masses relied on winter production to make up for the shortage of grain and solve production difficulties. Only 28 people engaged in transportation earned 45,700 yuan, an average of 1,600 yuan per person, equivalent to more than 1.5 shi of rice, enough for one person to eat for half a year. Secondly, according to incomplete statistics from 680 villages in 15 counties including Zuoquan, Changzhi, and Qinyang: women spun 92,814 jin of cotton and wove 75,022 chi of cloth. In terms of fertilizer accumulation, great achievements have also been made in the past three months (December last year to February this year). According to incomplete statistics from 784 villages in 18 counties including Xingtai, Qixian, and Qinyang, a total of 49,796,431 dan of fertilizer were accumulated. In addition, the entire region has planned and carried out firewood and coal accumulation to prepare fuel for the busy farming season. According to incomplete statistics from 575 villages in 15 counties including Zuoquan, Shahe, and Xiyang, a total of 10,577,830 dan of firewood were cut and 63,842,886 jin of coal were transported. The basic experience in achieving the above results lies in strengthening leadership and giving full play to the role of organization. Many villages paid attention to ideological mobilization from the beginning, overcame the masses' thinking of winter idleness, and led winter production in an organized and planned manner. For example, Xiaonanqing Village in the Fourth District of Huguan County, after completing autumn plowing in early November last year, immediately launched winter production in conjunction with the end of land reform. First, it solved the problem of village cadres waiting for the end of land reform before carrying out production. After research, the cadres divided their work and organized the masses to carry out sideline production activities. Secondly, cooperative societies in many areas played a huge organizational role in winter production. For example, after the Zuoquan Seventh District Hamaotan Village heard the county party committee's slogan of "Strive to earn an average of 100 yuan per person in winter production," the village cadres organized all the village's labor and livestock, and divided them into several groups for basket weaving, transportation, and charcoal burning according to local production conditions. Under the unified leadership of the village production committee and the village cooperative, various production activities were carried out separately. So far, a total profit of 115,820 yuan has been earned, and the 586 people in the village have earned an average of 190 yuan per person, nearly doubling the standard set by the slogan, which greatly made up for the poor autumn grain harvest and excited everyone. At present, the entire region is summarizing winter production and carrying out the spring plowing campaign.

　　太行冬季生产打下春耕基础
  　积累大量生产资本
    赞皇等县千余村赚三千万元　增牲口两万头积肥五千万担
    【太行电】太行的冬季生产，给今年的春耕作了直接准备。从去年十二月到今年二月，三个月来，全区的冬季生产取得巨大成绩，根据各地不完全的材料统计，黎城、磁县、修武、襄垣、昔阳、长治、平顺、辉县等二十四个县一千一百二十四个村的运输、编作、榨油等副业生产，总获利三千零七十九万余元（人民币，下同），又米二千零九十八石余；这批生产收入，除直接补助了群众的生活口粮外，即大部运用到再生产投资上，再加上部份贷款的扶植及群众游资的组织，去冬以来，各地牲口大量增加，据黎城、沙河、赞皇、和顺、左权、林县、武安、武乡、潞城等十九个县一千二百五十九个村的统计，增加牲口达二万四千二百零四头，平均每村增加牲口约十八头。赞皇白草坪村去秋歉收，群众依靠冬季生产，补足了粮食的不足，解决了生产困难，仅二十八人搞运输即赚洋四万五千七百元，平均每人赚一千六百元，折米一石五斗多，够一人半年吃用。其次，妇女纺织据左权、长治、沁阳等十五个县六百八十个村的不完全统计：纺花九万二千八百一十四斤，织布七万五千零二十二尺。在积肥工作上，三个月（去年十二月至今年二月）来也取得很大成绩，据邢台、淇县、沁阳等十八个县七百八十四个村不完全统计，共积肥四千九百七十九万六千四百三十一担。此外，全区有计划地进行了打柴积煤准备农忙季节的燃料，据左权、沙河、昔阳等十五个县五百七十五个村不完全统计，共打柴一千零五百七十七万八千三百担，又驮煤六千三百八十四万二千八百八十六斤。获得以上成绩的基本经验，是在于领导的加强与发挥组织起来的作用。不少村庄一开始即注意了思想发动，克服了群众冬闲思想，有组织有计划地领导冬季生产。如壶关四区小南青村，于去年十一月初完成秋耕后，紧接着就结合结束土改开展了冬季生产。首先解决了村干部中的等待结束土改后再进行生产的思想；经过研究，干部进行了分工，组织群众进行副业生产活动。其次不少地区的合作社在冬季生产中发挥了巨大的组织作用。如左权七区哈蟆滩村在县委提出“争取冬季生产中每人平均赚洋一百元”的口号之后，该村村干部即组织了全村劳畜力，根据当地生产条件，分成编筐、运输、烧木炭等几个小组，在该村生产委员会与村合作社统一领导下，分别进行各项生产。至今春共获利十一万五千八百二十元，全村五百八十六人，平均每人赚洋一百九十元，超过口号所提标准近一倍，大大弥补了去秋粮食的歉收，兴奋了大家的情绪。目前全区正总结冬季生产，开展春耕运动。
