Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 14th: TASS, Berlin, April 13th: The Communist Party of North Rhine-Westphalia, West Germany, recently convened its Second Congress. West German Communist leader Lehmann delivered a lengthy speech at the congress, sharply criticizing the West German "Occupation Statute" and the North Atlantic Treaty. Lehmann emphasized that the aggressors plan to incorporate West Germany, as a military and industrial base, into the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. This treaty is a descendant of the "Anti-Communist Pact," permeated with the spirit of Hitler, Mussolini, and Tojo. Lehmann pointed out that the people of the world have never yearned for peace as strongly as they do now, as evidenced by many events, one of which is the World Peace Congress to be held in Paris soon. Lehmann declared that West German representatives will also participate in the congress. Lehmann, on behalf of the German Communist Party, stated that the "Occupation Statute" deprives the West German people of their right to self-determination and independence. However, the German people have no intention of enduring this humiliation. Lehmann also said that although Adenauer (the speaker of the so-called "Bonn Parliament," the leader of the West German Christian Democratic Party) and Schumacher (the leader of the West German Social Democratic Party) refused to accept the invitation from the German People's Congress to participate in the all-German conference, the movement to increase mutual understanding between the people of West and East Germany is gaining momentum among West German workers, farmers, intellectuals, and industrialists and businessmen. Lehmann congratulated the Socialist Unity Party of Germany and the democratic forces in the Soviet-occupied zone, who are eager to establish a unified and independent German Republic. Lehmann concluded by calling on the people of West Germany, regardless of their political beliefs, to form a united front to fight for the unification and independence of Germany.

　　雷曼抨击“占领法规”
  　号召西德人民争取独立统一
    【新华社北平十四日电】塔斯社柏林十三日讯：西德北莱茵—威斯特伐利亚州共产党，最近召开第二届代表大会：西德共产党领袖雷曼在大会上发表长篇演说，尖锐抨击西德“占领法规”及北大西洋侵略公约。雷曼强调指出：侵略者计划把当作军事与工业基地的西德列入北大西洋公约机构中，该公约是“反共公约”的后裔，侵透着希特勒、墨索里尼和东条的精神。雷曼指出，全世界人民对和平的渴望，从没有象现在这样强烈，这点已为许多事件所证明，其中之一就是即将在巴黎召开的世界拥护和平大会。雷曼宣称，西德代表也将参加大会。雷曼代表德国共产党声称：“占领法规”剥夺了西德人民的自决与独立的权利。但是，德国人民无意忍受这种耻辱。雷曼又称，虽然阿登纳（所谓“波恩议会”的议长，西德基督教民主党的领袖）与舒马赫“西德社会民主党的领袖”拒绝应允德国人民代表大会的邀请参加全德会议，但是，西德与东德人民增进互相了解的运动，在西德工人、农民、知识分子与工商业者中间正日益得势。雷曼祝贺德国统一社会党与苏占区的民主力量，他们是热望成立统一与独立的德意志共和国的。雷曼最后号召西德人民不分政治信仰组成联合阵线以争取德国的统一与独立。
