　　Plains People Support the Army's Southern Advance
    Repairing Over 3,000 Li of Highways
  　Eight Highways in Hebei-Shandong-Henan Now Lead to the Central Plains
    [Jinan Dispatch] The people of Jinan, Hebei, are supporting the People's Liberation Army's southern expedition, building 2,000 li of highways, seven large bridges (including the Weihui River large pontoon bridge with a carrying capacity of 20 tons), and five small bridges.
    [Hebei-Shandong-Henan Dispatch] To support the People's Liberation Army's crossing of the Yangtze River and advance southward, the people of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan region are rushing to repair highways day and night. According to incomplete statistics, in February and March, the total length of highways repaired in various places reached more than 1,480 li, and more than 60 large and small brick, stone, and wooden bridges were built. Currently, the entire region has eight highway trunk and branch lines leading to the Central Plains. Over 500,000 civilians and 1,000 cadres participated in this highway repair effort. Due to the attention paid to educating the road repair workers and conducting thorough current affairs propaganda, the broad masses of workers understood the great purpose and significance of road repair, showing unprecedentedly high enthusiasm and initiative. In many areas, in order to complete the repair work ahead of schedule to avoid delaying the rapid southern advance of the People's Liberation Army, the masses voluntarily got up early and went to bed late, even rushing to repair roads day and night. As a result, the originally planned four-day repair plan was completed in just two to three days. Women in Nanle, Gaoling and other places also actively participated in the road repair work, competently undertaking lighter tasks such as dismantling bricks and digging earth, thereby freeing up a large number of full laborers for tasks such as ramming.
    [Hebei Central Dispatch] To support the People's Liberation Army's southern advance, the people of central Hebei are rushing to repair highways. Three thousand civilian workers in the Pingnan Special District completed 150 li in three days, regardless of the wind and rain. The people of Xinxiong County (newly established county) dug 78 earth wells to sprinkle water on the roads. The ramming team and the road rolling team in Peng Erwan sang in unison: "Everyone exert all your strength, quickly repair the road, hey yo! Cross the Yangtze River, hey yo! Liberate all of China, hey yo ya yo..." The singing further invigorated the people. More than 11,400 civilian workers in Qing County repaired 67 li of highway in just four days. The Jiedi Bridge in Cang County and the large bridge south of An'guo Jiaozhuang Village were also restored through the efforts of the people. In order to facilitate troop movement, Qingyuan County has leveled all the traffic trenches throughout the county.

　　平原人民支援大军南下
    赶修公路三千余里
  　冀鲁豫已有八条公路通往中原
    【冀南电】冀南人民支援人民解放军南征，修建公路二千华里，大桥七座（内有载重二十吨的卫河大浮桥），小桥五座。
    【冀鲁豫电】为支援人民解放军渡江南进，冀鲁豫区人民日夜抢修公路。据不完全统计，二、三两月份，各地抢修完竣之公路线达一千四百八十余华里，建筑大小砖、石、木桥六十余座。现全区已有八条公路干线与支线通往中原。参加此次抢修公路之民工达五十余万人，干部达一千人。由于注意了对修路民工的教育，比较深入地进行了时事宣传，广大民工了解了修路的伟大目的和意义，表现了空前高涨的积极性和自动性。许多地区为提前完成抢修工作以不误解放军迅速南进，群众纷纷自动早起晚睡，以至日夜赶修，因而原订四天的抢修计划只需两天至三天即告完成。南乐、高陵等地的妇女亦积极参加此次修路工作，她们胜任愉快地担任着拆砖、挖土等较轻便的工作，由此便节省出大批全劳力用于打硪等工作。
    【冀中电】为支援人民解放军大军南下，冀中人民赶修公路。平南专区的三万余民工，不顾风吹雨打，三天完成一百五十里。新雄县（新设县）人民为在公路上面泼水，挖了土井七十八眼。彭二湾的打夯组和轧路组，齐声唱着：“大家使齐了劲呀，快着修好道呀，咳哟！打过长江去，咳哟！解放全中国呀，咳哟呀哟………”歌声更振奋了人心。青县一万一千四百多民工仅四天，就修好六十七里公路。沧县捷地桥和安国焦庄村南的大桥，也在人民努力下修复。清苑为了便于部队行动，已将全县各地的交通沟都平好了。
