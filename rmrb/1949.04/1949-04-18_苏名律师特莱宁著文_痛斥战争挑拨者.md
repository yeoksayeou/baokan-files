Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 17th: TASS, Moscow: The newspaper "Izvestia" published a special article on the 14th by Trainin, a well-known Soviet lawyer and corresponding member of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, as the World Congress of Supporters of Peace is about to open in Paris on April 20. The article begins by stating: The Second World War has greatly increased the political consciousness and political activity of the people of all countries. People's democratic countries have begun to flourish and grow in Southeastern Europe. The democratic forces of the world are also growing stronger. These most important historical transformations have caused evil commotion in the camp of warmongers. A small group of despicable minorities are terrified by the awakening of millions of people and are trying to subject the countries to another massacre. For this purpose, they emit a torrent of slander and lies. Shameless, slanderous spears are aimed at the countries of the intended aggression—the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries. International evolution is becoming increasingly tense due to each new "defense" pact. This has immediately aroused strong opposition from the masses. Friends of peace, regardless of the prohibitions, atrocities, and obstructions of the ruling groups in capitalist countries, have transcended national boundaries to unite and help each other.
    The author emphasized: The Soviet Union is a steadfast defender of the interests of the masses and the cause of promoting peace, with both ideals and actions. The author pointed out that the future does not belong to war provocateurs. History is created by the invincible democratic forces and the Soviet Union, which inspires them. History is advancing along a new path of progress and civilization. It is not so simple to repeat the experiments of Hitler's Germany and launch a new world war under the new circumstances. Trainin concluded: People have always expected peace, and now they have learned how to fight for peace, and they must fight for peace.

　　苏名律师特莱宁著文
  　痛斥战争挑拨者
    【新华社北平十七日电】塔斯社莫斯科讯：消息报以世界拥护和平大会即将于四月二十日在巴黎开幕，十四日特发表苏联著名律师、苏联科学院通讯会员特莱宁的专文。该文首称：第二次世界大战已使各国人民的政治觉悟和政治活动大大增长。人民民主国家已开始在东南欧繁荣成长。全世界民主力量也正在壮大着。这些最重要的历史转变，在战争贩子阵营中引起了邪恶的骚动。一小撮卑鄙的少数人因千百万人的觉醒而感到惊恐，力图使各国再遭一次大屠杀。为了这一目的，他们发出诽谤与谎言的浊流。无耻的，诬蔑的矛头正对着预定侵略对象的国家——苏联和人民民主国家。国际的演变正因每一个新的“防御”公约而益趋紧张。这已立即引起了群众的强有力反对。和平之友不顾资本主义国家统治集团的禁止、暴行与阻挠，已超越国界，团结互助。
    作者强调指出：苏联是始终不渝地挺身服务于人民大众的利益和促进和平事业的有理想也有行动的卫士。作者指出，将来不是属于战争挑拨者的，历史是由不可征服的民主力量以及鼓舞它们的苏联所创造的，历史是沿着进步与文明的新道路前进的。要在新的情况下重复希特勒德国的实验，发动新的世界大战，并不那么简单。特莱宁结语说：人民历来期望和平，现在他们已学会了如何为和平而战，他们也一定要为和平而战。
