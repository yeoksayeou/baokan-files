　　Northeast Cultural Snippets
    ▲The Northeast Bureau of the CPC Central Committee has recently decided to establish the First Yucai Elementary School in Shenyang, primarily to enroll the children of staff members directly under the Northeast Bureau. All expenses for the students will be provided by the school.
    ▲The Shenyang Northeast Daily recently held a symposium for worker correspondent representatives. The correspondents expressed the hope that the newspaper's reporters would frequently visit factories for interviews. They also hoped that workers' manuscripts would not be backlogged, as many manuscripts were delayed for ten days to half a month. They hoped to publish more reports on the active production of workers in the old liberated areas and various model deeds.

　　东北文化零讯
    ▲中共中央东北局顷决定在沈阳成立第一育才小学，以招收东北局直属机关工作人员的子女为主。学生一切费用均由学校供给。
    ▲沈阳东北日报社日前召开工人通讯员代表座谈会，各通讯员代表希望报社记者能常到工厂去采访。工人写的稿件不要积压，不少稿件被压迟了十天半月。希望多登一些老解放区工友积极生产的情形及各种模范事迹。
