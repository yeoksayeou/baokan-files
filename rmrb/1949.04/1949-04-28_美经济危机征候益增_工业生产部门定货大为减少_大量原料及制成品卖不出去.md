Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 27th: A correspondent for the Polish News Agency in New York reports: Signs of an economic crisis in the United States are increasingly evident. American economic experts who had hoped for an improvement in the economic situation in the spring have been disappointed. In March, the average work week (legally 40 hours per week) was reduced by half an hour, which means a corresponding reduction in workers' wages. Coupled with rising unemployment, the people's purchasing power will further decline. Many sectors of industrial production show a significant reduction in orders. American wholesalers stated in a special survey: "We have accumulated large quantities of raw materials and finished products." The reduction in demand has caused prices of agricultural and industrial products, as well as raw materials, to fall. The price of zinc fell to a quarter of its original price in March, and it is expected that other prices will also fall soon. Agricultural product prices are already falling. The Wall Street Journal reports: "This year, farmers are selling corn for 30 percent less than last year, and livestock and dairy products for 20 percent less." Despite official optimism, the President's economic advisors have been asked to conduct a special study of the overall economic situation with its dwindling employment numbers and to complete it by May 15th.

　　美经济危机征候益增
  　工业生产部门定货大为减少
    大量原料及制成品卖不出去
    【新华社北平二十七日电】波兰通讯社驻纽约记者报导：美国经济危机的征候已经愈益增多，那些希望春季能改进经济情势的美经济专家，也已经失望了。在三月份，平均工作周（法定每周工作四十小时）减少了半小时，这就表示工人工资相应减少，再加上日益增加的失业，人民购买力就要更加低落。工业生产的许多部门显示大批定货大为减少。美国批发商在一特别调查书中声称：我们积存了大量原料与制成品。需求的减少已使农产品与工业品以及原料的价格下跌。锌的价格在三月跌到了原价四分之一的程度，预料其他物价也即将下跌。农产品价格已在跌落。华尔街日报称：今年农民的玉米卖价要比去年低百分之三十，家畜和乳品要低百分之二十。虽然官方表示乐观，但总统经济顾问已被要求对就业人数日益减少的经济总情势，加以特别研究，并限五月十五日以前完成。
