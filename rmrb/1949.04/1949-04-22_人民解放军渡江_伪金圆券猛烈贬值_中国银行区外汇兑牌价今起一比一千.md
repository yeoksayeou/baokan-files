　　The People's Liberation Army Crosses the Yangtze River
　　Pseudo-Gold Yuan Plummets in Value
　　Bank of China's Overseas Exchange Rate Starts Today at 1 to 1,000
　　[This Newspaper's News] As the People's Liberation Army marches south in a steady stream, about to cross the Yangtze River, the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang is quickly approaching complete collapse. The pseudo-gold yuan issued by them has depreciated again and again, almost becoming worthless paper. People are afraid of it rotting in their hands, so they rush to buy physical goods as soon as they get it. As a result, prices in cities like Nanjing and Shanghai have skyrocketed, and the market is in complete chaos. The price of gold, banknotes, and silver dollars increased by 110% in just one day (for example, in Shanghai on the 20th, one tael of gold cost 13.2 million yuan, but on the 21st it rose to 27.3 million yuan; one US dollar cost 270,000 yuan on the 20th, but 550,000 yuan on the 21st; one silver dollar cost 250,000 yuan on the 20th, but 500,000 yuan on the 21st). The prices of food, cloth, yarn, etc. have also increased by about 50% (rice cost 1.47 million yuan per dan on the 20th, but rose to 2.4 million yuan on the 21st; "warship" flour cost 520,000 yuan per bag on the 20th, but rose to 710,000 yuan on the 21st; 20-count yarn cost 48 million yuan per piece on the 20th, but rose to 73 million yuan on the 21st; Dragon Head fine cloth cost 1.51 million yuan per bag on the 20th, but rose to 2.08 million yuan on the 21st. All the above prices are in pseudo-gold yuan). The Bank of China's overseas exchange rate has therefore been further increased to 1 to 1,000.
　　[Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 21st Dispatch] The soaring prices in the Kuomintang-controlled areas have triggered huge rice riots. According to the Shanghai Shen Bao, fifteen rice looting incidents occurred in Chongqing on the 16th of this month, with hundreds of dan of rice being seized by hungry people. The rising tide of prices in the Shanghai market reached a new high on the 19th. The price of rice per shi dan has risen to 1.7 million pseudo-gold yuan, the asking price for each US dollar is 300,000 yuan, and the price of gold per tael has risen to 15 million yuan. The general price level has risen by more than 15 times compared to the beginning of this month, and by 80,000 times compared to August of last year. On the 17th, the North and South rice markets in Shanghai experienced chaos due to the sharp price increases. The Shanghai Kuomintang reactionary authorities ordered a halt to trading and set a maximum price of 1.3 million yuan per shi of rice; however, because the price increases were caused by the Kuomintang pseudo-government's exploitation of the people through the excessive issuance of banknotes, the price control order quickly failed. Under the pressure of daily soaring prices, the hunger and discontent of Shanghai's million workers are increasing daily. Prices in Fuzhou are also continuing to fluctuate at an average daily rate of 30%. The general price level in the city is more than 50,000 times higher than the level of August 19th of last year. The continuous devaluation of the pseudo-gold yuan is accelerating the financial and economic collapse of the entire Kuomintang reactionary rule. The wave of factory closures in various cities of the Kuomintang-controlled areas continues to develop, and more factories in Shanghai have closed down. The Kuomintang reactionary government's printing presses are working day and night, but they are still not enough to supply the huge financial expenditures. In this situation, the Kuomintang government is planning to issue so-called "silver dollar notes" to replace the "gold yuan notes" in order to plunder the people through new inflationary measures. According to a report by the Kuomintang Central News Agency on the 15th, "the issuance of silver dollar notes has reached a mature stage." However, this move will not be able to reverse the economic collapse of the Kuomintang-controlled areas. A dispatch from Shanghai by the American news agency Associated Press on the 19th also acknowledged that the Kuomintang government's "fate of issuing new currency is doomed from the beginning, and the new currency will fail as miserably as the gold yuan."

　　人民解放军渡江
  　伪金圆券猛烈贬值
    中国银行区外汇兑牌价今起一比一千
    【本报讯】人民解放军源源南下，行将渡江，国民党反动统治很快就要完全垮台，其所发行的伪金元券一跌再跌，几成废纸，人们都怕烂在自己手里，拿到了就争购实物，因而京沪等地物价狂涨，市场完全陷于混乱状态。金、钞、银元仅隔一日即上升百分之一百一十（如上海二十日黄金一三二○万元，二十一日涨至二七三○万元，美钞二十日为二七万，二十一日涨至五五万，银元二十日二五万元，二十一日涨至五○万元），食粮、布、纱等亦均上升约百分之五十（大米每担二十日一四七万，二十一日涨至二四○万，兵船粉每袋二十日五二万，二十一日涨至七一万，二十支纱每件二十日四八○○万，二十一日涨至七三○○万，龙头细布每袋二十日一五一万，二十一日涨至二○八万。以上均伪金圆券价）中国银行之区外汇兑牌价亦因之再行提高为一比一、○○○。
    【新华社北平廿一日电】国民党统治区物价的狂涨，引起巨大的抢米风潮。据上海申报披露：本月十六日重庆发生十五起抢米骚动，数百担大米为饥民夺去。上海市场的涨风，十九日又达到新的高点。大米每市担已涨到伪金圆券一百七十万元，美钞每元喊价三十万元，黄金每两涨至一千五百万元。一般物价水平较本月初已上涨十五倍以上，较去年八月已上涨八万倍。十七日上海南北米市曾因涨价猛烈而发生混乱。上海国民党反动当局曾下令停止交易，并限定大米每市石最高价格为一百三十万；但由于物价上涨乃国民党伪政府以滥发纸币剥削人民所造成，限价令已迅速破产。在逐日飞涨的高物价压力下，上海百万工人的饥饿状态和不满情绪正在逐日增进。福州物价亦以平均每日上涨百分之三十的速度继续波动不已。该市一般物价已高出去年八月十九日水平的五万倍以上。伪金圆券的不断贬值，正推动整个国民党反动统治的财政经济加速崩溃，国民党统治区各城市工业倒闭的浪潮继续发展，上海已有更多的工厂关门歇业。国民党反动政府的印钞机日夜不停地工作，但仍不足供应浩大的财政开支。在这种情势下，国民党政府又打算发行所谓“银元券”代替“金圆券”，以新的通货膨胀手段掠夺人民。据国民党中央社十五日报道，“发行银元券一事，已臻于成熟阶段”。但此举绝不能挽回国民党统治区的经济崩溃。美国通讯社美联社十九日自上海发出的电讯中亦承认：国民党政府“发行新币的命运从一开头起就已经注定了，新币将和金圆券失败得一样惨。”
