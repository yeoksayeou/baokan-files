　　Widespread Afforestation
　　▲The Zhangjiakou Railway Bureau has obtained a large number of various tree seedlings from the Forestry and Animal Husbandry Section of the Chahar Provincial Department of Agriculture and is preparing to plant them along the railway lines in the vicinity around the Qingming Festival.
　　　　(Zhang Juwu)
　　▲The 4th, 5th, and 7th district villages of Xingtang have established sand desert afforestation committees. The 4th district has already planted more than 7,500 trees. Fu Jiwen, a farmer from Gujun Village in the 7th district, has planted 1,000 trees this year.
　　▲The She County Party Committee convened a meeting of all county cadres on the 14th, calling on all villages to plant trees widely to complete the task of planting 360,000 trees, laying the foundation for long-term construction. (County Party Committee Office)
　　▲Yushe plans to plant 300,000 trees along the Shahe River and 150,000 trees on the hillsides. Each cadre must plant at least three trees. Li Chunrong, head of the County Cooperative Section, led people to move back 320 small pine trees from the mountains south of the city and planted them around the city.
　　　　　　(Rong Sheng, Zhi Zhong)
　　▲Lingshou has launched a large-scale tree-planting upsurge along both banks of the Cihe River. According to current statistics, more than 19,000 trees have been planted. More than 15,000 trees have been planted on flat land.
　　▲In Xinle's 3rd district, 376 male and female farmers from Dongcao Village, led by the Communist Youth League, planted a total of 33,580 trees on the 8th and 9th of this month, covering an area of 647 mu.
　(De Chun, Jian Ying)
　　▲Wanping recently held a symposium of veteran farmers to exchange tree-planting experiences. (Li Fangyi)
　　▲According to incomplete statistics from only five districts in Quyang, more than 148,000 trees have already been planted. (Long Zhu, Yi Min)
　　▲Daqiu Lin Village in Gaoyi planted 2,100 trees last winter. This spring, due to the lack of tree seedlings, tree owners with poplar and willow trees stated: "As long as they are not cut down to burn, branches below walnut thickness can be cut at will," solving the difficulty of tree seedlings.
　　　　　　　　(Zhang Guoquan)
　　▲The trees around Wangdu City were all cut down by the Kuomintang bandit army when they were in power, and the forests within the territory were also severely damaged. This spring, the County Party Committee specially called for the restoration of forests throughout the county and vigorously planted trees. Currently, 160 trees have been planted in Beiguan and 340 trees in Nanguan. Other villages have also joined the tree-planting upsurge.
