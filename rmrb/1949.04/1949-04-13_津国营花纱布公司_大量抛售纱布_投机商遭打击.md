Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, April 11th: The Tianjin State-Run Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company correctly led the market and cracked down on speculators, stabilizing cotton cloth prices. Since mid-March, prices in Tianjin have generally stabilized. A few speculators, distressed by the lack of opportunities for speculation, started spreading rumors and raising prices on the 6th of this month. Speculators first engaged in black market trading of gold and silver, subsequently causing fluctuations in the yarn and cloth market. On the 5th of this month, a bolt of "Five Blessings" cloth from the No. 2 Textile Factory was selling for only 4,250 yuan. Due to large-scale purchases by speculators, the price gradually rose starting on the 6th, reaching a high of over 4,700 yuan. The Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company then sold a large quantity at a price of 4,550 yuan per bolt. On the 8th, the company suddenly lowered the listed price of "Five Blessings" cloth from 4,550 yuan to 4,250 yuan. At this point, speculators dared not purchase any more. The market price therefore fell from 4,750 yuan to 4,350 yuan. At the same time, the People's Bank also notified its subordinate departments and offices, as well as the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications, to suspend lending and overdrafts in order to tighten credit. By this point, speculators suffered significant setbacks both directly and indirectly, and prices in Tianjin gradually declined as a result.

[Another Dispatch] To directly supply citizens with spring clothing and prevent them from being exploited by speculators, the Tianjin Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company has opened 32 consignment shops for clothing. On the 6th of this month alone, a total of 11,145 bolts of white cloth and 40 bolts of colored cloth were sold. As a result, many workers, students, and citizens were able to buy clothing at wholesale prices.

  　大量抛售纱布
  　投机商遭打击
    【新华社天津十一日电】津市国营花纱布公司正确地领导市场，打击投机商人，稳定了棉布价格。三月中旬以来，津市物价即日趋平稳。少数投机商人苦于无机可投，乃于本月六日起制造谣言，抬高物价。投机商人先从事金银黑市交易，继引起纱布商场波动。本月五日，中纺二厂五福布每匹仅售四千二百五十元，由于投机商人大量收购，致六日起即逐步上涨，最高时曾达四千七百余元。花纱布公司当以每匹四千五百五十元之价格大量出售。至八日该公司复将五福布牌价由四千五百五十元突降至四千二百五十元。此时投机商人即不敢再行购进。市价因而由四千七百五十元跌至四千三百五十元。与此同时，人民银行亦通知所属各部、处及中国、交通两行，一律暂停放款，并停止一般透支，借以收缩银根。至此投机商人遂直接间接均受重大打击，津市物价因而逐渐回落。
    【又讯】津市花纱布公司为直接供给市民春季衣料，使其免受投机商人中间剥削，特先后开设衣料代售店三十二家。本月六日一天，即共售出白布一万一千一百四十五匹，色布四十匹。不少职工、学生及市民，均因此得以按批发价格买到了衣料。
