　　Strengthening Work in People's Education Centers
  　Instructions from the Propaganda Department of the 11th District Committee of Hebei Central
    [Our Newspaper] The Propaganda Department of the 11th District Committee of Hebei Central recently put forward the following opinions on how to strengthen the publicity activities of the People's Education Centers in various counties: 1. Strengthen organizational leadership: The People's Education Centers should be directly led by the county propaganda departments, and cadres from the People's Education Centers can participate when the propaganda departments study propaganda work. In addition, it can check whether the cadres of the People's Education Center are qualified. 2. The radios of each county must be set up in the People's Education Center, and the received news must be written or broadcast in a timely manner. In order to establish a closer relationship with the masses, question offices can be set up to answer questions raised by the masses based on the answers in the "Question Column" of the Hebei Daily. If major problems are not easy to answer, they can be forwarded to the Hebei Daily; when answering minor problems, they must consult with the responsible cadres of the Propaganda Department. Larger county towns should set up more blackboard newspapers in the downtown area. On market days, prevent merchants from gathering in front of the gate and hindering work. 3. Use various forms to publicize the Party's policies, such as organizing folk artists and organizing lectures. In addition to displaying books and newspapers in the center, cartoons, pictorials, and photographs should be added, and special attention should be paid to adding cartoons related to large-scale production.

　　加强民教馆工作
  　冀中十一地委宣传部指示
    【本报讯】冀中十一地委宣传部，顷对如何加强各县民众教育馆宣传活动，提出如下意见：一、加强组织领导：民教馆应直接由县宣传部领导，宣传部在研究宣传工作时，可吸收民教馆干部参加。此外可检查民教馆干部是否称职。二、各县之收音机必须设在民教馆，所收消息要及时书写或广播出去。为了和群众取得更密切的联系，可设问事处，根据河北日报“问事栏”的答案，解答群众所提的问题。大问题不易解答时，可转河北日报；小问题解答时必须协同宣传部负责干部共同商榷。较大县城应在闹市多设黑板报。集日应防止商人云集门前妨碍工作。三、利用多样形式宣传党的政策，如组织民间艺人及组织讲座等。馆内除陈列书报外，应添设漫画、画报、照片等，并应特别注意添列有关大生产的漫画。
