Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 7th: TASS Rome Dispatch: The working people of all of Italy, upon learning that Foreign Minister Sforza represented Italy in signing the North Atlantic Treaty in Washington, disregarded all the special "alert" measures taken by the police authorities and launched a new wave of protests across the country on the day the treaty was signed (April 4). According to newspaper reports, all enterprises in Milan went on strike on the afternoon of the 4th, and all factory sirens sounded at 3 p.m. as an expression of the anger of the working class of Northern Italy towards the signing of the North Atlantic Treaty. Protest rallies and demonstrations were also held on the same day in Trento, Bologna, Ferrara, Reggio, Emilia, Modena, Brescia, and other towns. In Padua, despite the police surrounding all factories and workshops from dawn, thousands of working people still held gatherings. The Italian Preparatory Committee for the World Congress of Supporters of Peace is receiving many resolutions from gatherings in various places, expressing support for peace and opposition to warmongers. On the same day, a delegation of Roman students submitted a resolution protesting the signing of the North Atlantic Treaty to officials at the American Embassy in Rome. Nenni, the leader of the left wing of the Socialist Party, Xie Jue, the Deputy Secretary-General of the Communist Party, and Vittorio, the Secretary-General of the General Confederation of Labor, have all delivered speeches at protest rallies held in various places in the past few days. Nenni said at a meeting of Socialist Party activists in Milan: "In order to defend the interests of socialism today, it is necessary to unite around the Soviet Union."

After the signing of the North Atlantic Treaty, the Gasperi government has taken special measures to "maintain order." The strength of the Roman patrol police has been strengthened. The embassies of "friendly" countries—the signatory countries of the North Atlantic Treaty—are guarded by the police. The vicinity of the American Embassy has been guarded since the 4th by a large number of police equipped with armored vehicles. The "Evening Times" stated that special measures to deal with possible protest demonstrations have been taken not only in the capital but also in other centers in Italy, first and foremost in Milan, Turin, Genoa, and Emilia. In some places, soldiers and mounted police have been ordered not to leave their barracks.
