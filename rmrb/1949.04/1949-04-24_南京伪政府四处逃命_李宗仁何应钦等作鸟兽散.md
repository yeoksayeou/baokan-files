Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, 23rd: Following the victorious crossing of the Yangtze River by the People's Liberation Army's million-strong troops, the entire reactionary ruling apparatus of the Kuomintang in Nanjing rapidly disintegrated, and all its key figures have fled in panic in all directions. The various Yuan, Ministries, and Commissions of the puppet government fled to Guangzhou on the 22nd. The puppet Presidential Office also fled to Shanghai on the same day. The puppet Acting President Li Zongren and the puppet Executive Yuan President He Yingqin have both fled Nanjing. Dozens of planes from the puppet Central and China aviation companies, carrying puppet officials fleeing for their lives, took off continuously from three airports. The airports were crowded with high-ranking officials and dignitaries who, just a few days ago, were riding roughshod over the common people but are now in a state of utter disarray, along with the piles of luggage and valuables they had plundered from the people. On the 22nd, the puppet Executive Yuan President He Yingqin dispatched a large number of planes to transport a portion of his luggage to Taiwan. The puppet President of the Control Yuan Yu Youren, the puppet President of the Legislative Yuan Tong Guanxian, the puppet Director of the National History Museum Ju Zheng, the puppet Secretary-General of the Presidential Office Weng Wenhao, and other key figures such as Jia Jingde, Niu Yongjian, Sun Yueqi, and Zhang Daofan have fled to Shanghai. The puppet Vice President of the Legislative Yuan Liu Jianqun and others have fled to Guangzhou. Hundreds of puppet legislators and puppet supervisors are scattering to Shanghai, Hangzhou, Taipei, Guangzhou, and various cities in South China. The Kuomintang bandit gang, scattering like frightened birds, is looting a large amount of national treasury property and destroying and burning materials and files. The puppet Ministry of Finance has smuggled important archives to Shanghai and plans to flee to Guangzhou along with the puppet Central Bank. The stove in He Yingqin's official residence has been burning fiercely all day long, and his secretaries are burning all the official documents that cannot be taken away. (Attached picture)
