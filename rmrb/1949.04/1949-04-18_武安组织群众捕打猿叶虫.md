　　Wu'an Organizes the Masses
  　To Catch and Kill Flea Beetles
    [Taihang News] In the latter half of last month, a type of vegetable pest occurred in the third and eighth districts of Wu'an, causing serious damage to crops. Of the 2,000 mu of rapeseed planted in Wu'an, 500 mu were damaged. The larvae are brown, small and soft, about two-thirds of an inch long, and quickly develop wings, reproducing rapidly. After research, it was determined that these were flea beetle larvae. There are three methods of control: First, fill a small basin with limewater, hold a broom in one hand, and beat the vegetable seedlings, causing the insects to fall into the basin and be killed. Second, grind bitter tree bark into flour and sprinkle it on the vegetable leaves. Third, put red fuel into a woodpile and burn it to ashes, then mix it with twenty times the amount of wood ash and sprinkle it on the vegetable leaves. The county has now established an insect extermination headquarters to organize the masses to catch and kill the pests. (Kai Qi)

　　武安组织群众
  　捕打猿叶虫
    【太行讯】上月下旬武安城关三、八两区发生一种菜虫，吃害庄稼很严重。城关种油菜二千亩，就有五百亩被吃坏。幼虫褐色，小而软，长约二三分，很快就生翅，繁殖很快。研究后认为这是猿叶虫的幼虫。治法有三：一、以小盆内盛石灰水，一手拿笤帚，鼓打菜秧，虫子落入盆内即被杀死。二、用苦树皮磨成面，撒在菜叶上也可。三、用红的放入柴堆里，用火烧成灰，然后再加上二十倍柴灰混和撒入菜叶上也可。现该县已成立灭虫指挥部，组织群众进行捕打。（开琪）
