Tianjin Railway Department Holds Award Ceremony; Eighty Railway Heroes Receive Awards

[Tianjin News] The Tianjin Military Control Commission Railway Department held an award ceremony on the 3rd.

Nearly 1,000 people attended, including representatives of the 25,000 railway employees and guests. Lu Zhengcao, Minister of Railways of the Chinese People's Revolutionary Military Commission, Guo Hongtao, Director of the Pingjin Railway Administration, and Huang Yifeng, Director of the Engineering Bureau of the Northeast Railway Column, made a special trip to attend.

Wu Mengzhen, former Director of the Tianjin Office of the Jinpu Railway, reviewed his past mistakes in his capacity as the person handing over the office, and called on his former colleagues to study hard and use their skills to serve the new China.

Director Guo Weicheng summarized the work of the Railway Department since liberation: the volume of freight reached 707,739 tons in March, compared to only 246,000 tons in February, an increase of more than double. The number of passengers reached 1,056,000 in March. The completion of such a large transportation task is entirely the result of the hard work of the railway employees.

After the speeches by two employee representatives, Guo Hongtao, Director of the Pingjin Railway Bureau, emphasized the importance of democratic management, saying that the Railway Bureau will formulate regulations to allow workers to participate in business meetings at all levels. He pointed out that the railway can only be well-managed with the participation of workers, and in order to meet this requirement, the working class must improve their studies and raise their political awareness. This statement was met with enthusiastic applause from the audience. The conference also held an award ceremony. Jiang Hongzhi, Deputy Engineer of the Steel Fittings Factory, won the first prize for actively organizing the factory protection work of the North and South factories before liberation, avoiding all dangers, and was finally arrested by the Chiang bandit army. Jiang Hongzhi adhered to the revolutionary stance, did not confess, and did not yield. He escaped from prison during the fiercest fighting and returned to the factory to organize workers to protect the factory. In addition, Jing Qingtang, a cleaner at the East Station, stayed at the East Station during the fiercest artillery fire, not leaving for three days and three nights, and finally preserved the property of the East Station, winning the first prize. A total of eighty railway employees were rewarded this time, either for meritorious service in protecting the factory or as labor models.

　　津铁道处交接给奖大会
  　八十位铁路英雄获奖
    【天津讯】天津军管会铁道处于三日举行交接给奖大会。
    到会的有二万五千铁路员工的代表和来宾近一千人，中国人民革命军事委员会铁道部长吕正操、平津铁路管理局长郭洪涛、东北铁道纵队工程局长黄逸峰都特地赶来参加。
    前津浦路天津办事处长吴梦祯以移交人资格检讨过去的错误，并向旧同人呼吁努力学习，把自己的技术为新中国服务。
    郭维城处长总结了解放以来铁道处的工作：货运吨数三月份达到七十万七千七百三十九吨，而二月份只有二十四万六千吨，增加到两倍以上。旅客人数三月内达到一百零五万六千人。这样大的运输任务的完成，完全是铁路员工辛勤努力的结果。
    两位职工代表讲话之后，平津路局郭洪涛局长强调民主管理的重要，说铁路局将要订出规章，让工人参加各级业务会议。他指出只有工人参加管理才能办好铁路，为了适应这个要求，工人阶级就必须提高学习，提高政治认识。这一段话获得会场全体热烈的掌声。大会并举行给奖。钢铁配件厂的副工程师蒋洪志获得一等奖，因为他在解放前积极组织了南北两厂的护厂工作，不避一切艰险，终于被蒋匪军逮捕，蒋洪志坚持了革命立场，不招供，不屈服，在战火最猛烈的时候逃出牢狱，仍然回到厂里组织工人护厂。此外东站清扫夫井庆堂在炮火最烈的时候坚守东站，三天三夜不离一步，终于保存了东站的财产，获得一等奖。此次共有八十位铁路职工，或因护厂有功，或因劳动模范得到奖励。
