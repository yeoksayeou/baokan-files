Huaibei Agricultural Machinery Factory
Introduces Pear Tree Pest Control Formula

To the Editor:

　　After seeing the article "Serious Pest Damage to Pears in Shulu County, Hope to Introduce Good Pest Control Methods" in your newspaper, we would like to introduce two medicines, and the methods of use are as follows: (1) Lead Arsenate: One jin of lead arsenate mixed with two hundred jin of clean water, stir well, and spray on the leaves of the fruit trees with a sprayer. The insects will be poisoned and die after eating it. (2) Calcium Arsenate: One jin of calcium arsenate, one jin of slaked lime powder, and two hundred jin of clean water, mixed and stirred well, and sprayed on the fruit trees with a sprayer (but be careful not to use it on fruits with pits such as peaches, apricots, and plums, to avoid causing phytotoxicity). The effectiveness is about the same. The above two medicines are sold by our factory. The address is No. 9 Luchang Street, North Gate of Xian Nong Tan, Beiping. First Branch of Huaibei Agricultural Machinery Factory.

To the Editor:

　　I saw the news about the pest damage to pear trees in Donglu County in the People's Daily on April 24. Based on my experience, there is a simple method, which I will introduce now: dig soil next to the pear tree, mix it with water into a sesame paste-like consistency, put it in a small bucket or ladle, and smear it on the trunk and large branches. Smear as much as possible where there are many eggs and where there are eggs. Do not smear tender branches if there are no eggs. This method is suitable when the eggs have not yet turned into insects. It cannot be cured now, but it can be prevented early next year.

　　华北农业机械厂
  　介绍治梨狗药方编者同志：
    见贵报登载“束鹿梨树虫害严重，希望介绍除虫良方”一文后，我们愿意介绍两种药，使用方法如后：（一）砒酸铅：一斤砒酸铅，和二百斤清水，混合搅匀，用喷雾器喷在果树花叶上，虫子吃了，就被毒死。（二）砒酸钙：一斤砒酸钙，和一斤熟石灰粉，二百斤清水，混合搅匀，用喷雾器喷在果树上（但注意果类核如桃、杏、李等不能施用，以免产生药害），效力也差不多。上面两种药，本厂出售。地址在北平先农坛北门禄长街九号。华北农业机械厂第一分厂。编辑同志：
    我在四月二十四日的人民日报上，看到东鹿梨树有虫害的消息，根据我的经验，有一个笨法，现在介绍出来：在梨树旁挖土，用水弄成芝麻酱形，用小桶或瓢装起来，往树干和大的枝干上抹擦。卵子多的地方和有卵的地方尽量抹；嫩的枝儿没有弹子就不要抹。这法在卵没变成虫时适用，现在治不了，年明可早预防。    范之春
