　　Yishui District Welcomes Spring Rain
　　Prefectural Committee Directs Seizing the Opportunity to Cultivate Land

　　[Chahar News] Most areas of Yishui District experienced spring rain from the night of March 27th to the morning of March 28th, creating favorable conditions for the development of spring plowing. The Prefectural Committee has issued urgent instructions to all counties: (1) Strengthen the county, district, and village production committees, establish production offices, and fully lead spring plowing. (2) Because the area of ​​bare and wasteland in the district is very large—generally accounting for about 10 to 30 percent in most counties—it is necessary to mobilize all manpower and animal power. It is required to finish plowing the bare land within half a month after the rain; districts and villages without bare land should universally organize recultivation. (3) Seize the opportunity after the rain to plant trees. (4) Continue to carry out water conservancy work. (5) Call for the planting of more early-maturing crops.

　　易水专区喜降春雨
  　地委指示抓紧耕地
    【察哈尔讯】易水专区大部地区，于三月二十七日夜至二十八日晨，下了春雨，对于开展春耕工作增加了有利条件。地委特紧急指示各县：（一）健全县、区、村生产委员会，成立生产办公室，全力领导春耕。（二）因全区白茬地、荒地面积很大，—一般县份约占百分之十到三十，所以需要动员一切人力畜力。要求能在雨后半月内耕完白茬地；没白茬地的区、村，要普遍组织复耕。（三）抓紧雨后栽树。（四）继续开展水利工作。（五）号召多种早熟作物。
