Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 9th: Regarding the Concrete Implementation of the Eight Principles, Chairman Mao's Telegram in Reply to Li Zongren.

Having received a telegram from Li Zongren of Nanjing on the 7th, Chairman Mao Zedong, with good intentions, replied with the following telegram on the 8th:

To Mr. Li Delin of Nanjing,

Your telegram of the Mao Yang (April) date has been received. The Chinese Communist Party's position on the current situation is fully stated in our declaration of January 14th of this year. Since your side agrees to take the eight terms as the basis for negotiations, it will not be difficult to arrive at a correct solution by seeking concrete implementation based on these eight principles. The issue of war criminals is also the same. The standard is whether it is conducive to the advancement of the cause of liberation of the Chinese people and whether it is conducive to resolving domestic problems by peaceful means. Under this standard, we are prepared to adopt a lenient policy. I told Mr. Zhang Wenbai this idea when I met with him today.

For the liberation of the Chinese people and the independence of the Chinese nation, for the early end of the war, the restoration of peace, and the benefit of starting the great work of production and construction nationwide, so that the country and the people can steadily enter a state of prosperity and well-being, it is imperative that both of us reach a peace agreement as soon as possible. The Chinese Communist Party is very willing to work hand in hand with all patriotic elements in the country to strive for this great goal.

Mao Zedong, April 8, 1949.

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 9th: A Central News Agency dispatch from Nanjing on the 8th stated: To show the government's sincerity in seeking peace, Acting President Li telegraphed Chairman Mao Zedong of the Chinese Communist Party to reiterate his determination to seek peace. The telegram was sent out at 11 o'clock last night. The original text is as follows:

To Chief Zhang Wenbai, please forward to Mr. Runzhi.

Since Zongren took office, he has overcome all difficulties and resolved to seek peace. The sincerity of this is understood by your party and all democratic figures. Now that the peace talks have begun, the government representatives have complied with the invitation to come to Peiping (Beijing), and the issues for negotiation have adopted the eight articles proposed by your party as the basis. Zongren, mindful of the cruelty of the war and the suffering of the people, and also learning from the historical errors of mankind, therefore considers the focus of the difficulties in the peace talks and is willing to make further expressions with a heart that feels the hunger and drowning of others as if it were his own: All so-called historical mistakes that may hinder peace, such as so-called war criminals, even if they are subject to the punishment of Tang, Zongren will gladly accept it himself without complaint. As for the great plan for national construction, we are determined to follow Dr. Sun Yat-sen's immortal will, join hands with your party, and work together with all democratic figures to undertake the mission of building a new China. Moreover, the world situation is becoming increasingly treacherous, and cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party is even more urgent. If we both adhere to this principle, other problems can be easily solved. What does Zongren seek? What I hope for today is to turn swords into ploughshares and bring peace to the people. This sincere heart is as clear as white water. I am sending this telegram to express my sincerity. I hope you will understand.

Your younger brother, Li Zongren, Mao Yang (April) seal.

Xinhua News Agency's note: Li Zongren's telegram still contains many Q-style (Ah Q) tones, and he is quite interested in boasting about himself. The so-called "Kuomintang-Communist cooperation" has no boundaries, which makes people feel a little disgusted. But fundamentally speaking, under the urging of the people of the whole country, Li Zongren seems to have increased some sincerity in hoping for the success of peace. Whether this is the case remains to be seen.

### 关于具体实现八项原则　毛主席电复李宗仁

　　关于具体实现八项原则
  　毛主席电复李宗仁
    【新华社北平九日电】八日，毛泽东主席在接获南京李宗仁七日来电后，本与人为善之意，答复一电如下：南京李德邻先生勋鉴：卯阳电悉。中国共产党对时局主张，具见本年一月十四日声明。贵方既然同意以八项条件为谈判基础，则根据此八项原则以求具体实现，自不难获得正确之解决。战犯问题，亦是如此。总以是否有利于中国人民解放事业之推进，是否有利于用和平方法解决国内问题为标准，在此标准下，我们准备采取宽大的政策。本日与张文白先生晤谈时，即曾以此意告之。为着中国人民的解放和中华民族的独立，为着早日结束战争，恢复和平，以利在全国范围内开始生产建设的伟大工作，使国家和人民稳步地进入富强康乐之境，贵我双方亟宜早日成立和平协定。中国共产党甚愿与国内一切爱国分子携手合作，为此项伟大目标而奋斗。毛泽东一九四九年四月八日。
    【新华社北平九日电】中央社南京八日电称：李代总统为表示政府谋和之诚意，特电中共主席毛泽东重申谋和之决心。是项电报业于昨夜十一时拍出。兹志其原文如次：
    张长官文白兄转润之先生有道：自宗仁主政以来，排除万难，决心谋和，悱恻之忱，谅贵党、各位民主人士所共亮察。今届和谈伊始，政府代表既已遵邀莅平，协谈问题亦已采纳贵方所提八条为基础，宗仁懔于战祸之惨酷，苍生之憔悴，更鉴于人类历史演成之错误，因以虑及和谈困难之焦点，愿秉己饥己溺之怀，更作进一步之表示：凡所谓历史错误足以妨碍和平如所谓战犯也者，纵有汤获之刑，宗仁一身欣然受之而不辞。至立国大计，决遵孙总理之不朽遗嘱，与贵党携手，并与各民主人士共负努力建设新中国之使命。况复世界风云，日益诡谲，国共合作，尤为迫切。如彼此同守此义，其他问题便可迎刃而解。宗仁何求，今日所冀，惟化干戈为玉帛，登斯民于衽席，耿耿此心，有如白水。特电布悃，诸希亮察。弟李宗仁卯阳印。新华社按：李宗仁此电尚有许多阿Ｑ语调，对于自己吹擂，颇饶兴趣。所谓“国共合作”，毫无界限，尤使人们感到心头有些作逆。但是在根本上说来，李宗仁在全国人民的督促之下，似乎已增长了某些希望和平成功的诚意。是否如此，且看将来。
