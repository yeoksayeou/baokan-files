Introduction to the Ding County Youth League

　　　　The Youth League was born in the Land Reform

The New Democratic Youth League of Ding County was established during the land reform movement in the winter of 1947. Throughout the peasant movement, poor and hired peasant youth first actively organized armed forces, monitored the sabotage activities of landlords and rich peasants, and held symposiums to conduct "turning over" and "pouring out bitterness" sessions. Their level of awareness was raised through vivid and richly-detailed class education. Following this, when the equal distribution of land began, middle peasant youth also had the desire to organize and participate in the movement. Based on the needs of the work and the demands of the youth, an organization for the broad masses of laboring youth—the Youth Vanguard—was established.

The Youth Vanguard played a certain role in the movement, but as the movement continued to develop, this large organization without a core could no longer meet the needs of the active youth elements. Therefore, the establishment of the New Democratic Youth League was promoted and brewed among the youth and the entire masses, starting step-by-step from key areas to a comprehensive scale.

　　　　Taking the Lead in Joining the Army

Soon after the League was established, it was precisely the time when the movement to join the army was launched. The League bravely welcomed this major and glorious task. Because the members were educated to understand that joining the People's Liberation Army was the glorious duty of every young adult, and backward ideas of being afraid to join the army were opposed, many members voluntarily signed up to join the army. According to incomplete statistics from six districts, 131 members joined the army. For example, the Youth League branch secretary of Yuetian and three members led 29 young people to enlist. There were many such examples. After enlisting, the members also became a reliable force in consolidating the new recruits. The Youth League was tested in this movement.

　　　　Supporting the Front Lines

Last November, when Chiang Kai-shek and Fu Zuoyi dreamed of a surprise attack on Shijiazhuang, a mass road-breaking movement was launched throughout the county. The members were even more actively involved, with both men and women working together. The members in villages on both sides of the Pinghan Railway further cooperated with the main forces to lead the masses in relocation and to scout out the enemy's situation at any time to inform the masses. After the Chiang bandit troops withdrew, the members also used their exemplary role to motivate the masses to repair the railways and highways as soon as possible, completing the task ahead of schedule. After the Pingjin Campaign began, many members signed up to join the militia to cooperate in the battle.

　　　　Promoting Production Mutual Aid

During the summer hoeing and autumn harvest production movements, under the promotion of the League, many production mutual aid groups were organized according to the principle of voluntariness and mutual benefit, solving the difficulty of lacking labor and helping the families of soldiers. In the Ninth District, more than half of the 33 villages organized mutual aid groups. The mutual aid group organized by the Youth League branch secretary of Ximatou, in addition to allocating labor themselves, also helped military families to pull wheat. In the autumn harvest, according to a survey of 100 Youth League branches, 334 mutual aid groups were formed under the leadership of the members, including 1,021 households and 1,458 people, including 760 men and 690 women, with 763 Youth League members. The Youth League united so many people to carry out production mutual aid, which shows that in various production activities for building a new democratic society, the Youth League will undoubtedly be one of the main forces. In production mutual aid, Youth League members created many exemplary examples. Ten Youth League members in Chen Zhuangzi helped each other in production and planted 12 mu more wheat than last year, saving one worker two and a half days. The mutual aid group organized by the Youth League members in Dongliuchun consisted of ten households and ten people, nine of whom were military families. After being organized, they did not need the village to cultivate on their behalf for a year, and the crops were harvested early and planted quickly. The active production and help to others by Youth League members like this has won praise from the masses, cadres, and families. The mother of a female League member said: "In the past, I wouldn't let her go to meetings, fearing it would delay work, but since she joined the Youth League and the mutual aid group, the family's production difficulties have been solved. I won't stop her from going to more meetings in the future."

　　　　In the Winter School Movement

At the beginning of running winter schools, many Youth League branches in the villages reviewed the shortcomings of running winter schools in the past, such as not arranging classes and groups according to everyone's needs and cultural level, or not being able to combine well with winter production, and lacking a conscious discipline. This time, in addition to political classes, cultural classes were freely grouped, and everyone discussed and selected content, hired teachers, and set rules themselves, combining production and setting time themselves. This improved the enthusiasm for learning and expanded learning achievements. The Youth League members in Xiaoxixiang Village led more than 60 young people to participate in the winter school, and in half a month, each person learned an average of 39 characters and learned two new songs. With the efforts of Youth League cadres and members throughout the county, winter schools were established in 270 villages. According to statistics from 14 districts, there were a total of 9,652 students, achieving considerable results.

The Youth League also played a major role in other tasks such as democratic party rectification and the collection of public grain.

　　　　The Youth's Fighting Force Has Grown Stronger in Various Movements

Over the past year, the Youth League of Ding County has been tempered through land reform, joining the army, production, winter school, democratic party rectification, and other movements, and has become stronger. The facts have proven that as long as the leadership pays attention to combining the establishment and expansion of the Youth League's organization with the current central tasks and movements, it is entirely possible, and it can play a role in promoting the completion of central tasks. At the same time, the work of the League is closely linked to the vital interests of the youth and their families, and it has won widespread support from the masses. The foundation of the League is solid.

By the end of February this year, the Youth League of Ding County had established 221 branches in 422 villages throughout the county, plus 23 school branches, for a total of 245 Youth League branches. According to incomplete statistics from 244 Youth League branches, there were 5,371 members. This youth fighting force has become a strong new force in building a new democratic society.

　　定县青年团介绍
  　　　　　青年团在土地改革中诞生
    定县新民主主义青年团是在一九四七年冬土地改革运动中建立起来的。在整个农民运动中，贫雇农青年首先积极的组织武装，监视地主富农的破坏活动，召开座谈会，进行翻心诉苦，在生动而有丰富内容的阶级教育下，觉悟程度提高了，接着平分土地开始，中农青年也有组织起来参加运动的要求，根据工作的需要和青年的要求，成立了广大劳动青年的组织——青年先锋队。
    青年先锋队在运动中发挥了它一定的作用，但当运动继续发展，这个庞大而没有核心的组织，已经不能满足青年积极分子的要求。因此就在青年和整个群众中，宣传酝酿了建立新民主主义青年团，由重点而全面，有步骤的开始建立。
    　　　　带头参军
    团刚建立不久，正是参军运动开展的时候，团勇敢的迎接了这个重大而光荣的任务，由于教育了团员了解参加人民解放军是每个青壮年的光荣义务。又反对了一部分怕参军的落后思想，因此有很多团员自动报名参军，据六个区不完全的统计有一三一个团员参了军，如月店团支书和三个团员带动了二十九个青年入伍，这种例子很多，在入伍以后团员也成了巩固新兵团的可靠力量，青年团在这次运动中，得到了考验。
    　　　　支援前线
    去年十一月当蒋介石傅作义梦想偷袭石家庄的时候，全县展开了群众性的破路运动。团员更是积极参加，男女一齐动手，平汉路两侧村子里的团员，更配合主力作战，领导群众转移，并随时侦察敌情，告知群众，在蒋匪军撤退后，抢修铁路公路，团员也用自己的模范作用带动群众，提早完成任务，在平津战役开始后，很多团员报名参加民兵，配合战斗。
    　　　　推动生产互助
    在夏锄秋收等生产运动中，在团的推动下，根据自愿两利的原则，组织了很多生产互助组，解决了缺乏劳动力的困难，并帮助军属生产。九区三十三个村有半数以上组织了互助组，西马头团支书组织的互助组，除自己拨工外，还帮助军属拔麦，在秋收中根据一百个团支部的调查，在团员的带动下，组成了三三四个互助组，包括了一○二一户，一四五八人，中间男七六○人，女六九○人，团员七六三人，青年团团结了这样多的群众来进行生产互助，这可以看出在从事新民主主义建设的各种生产中，青年团无疑的将是主力之一。在生产互助中，青年团员创造了很多模范例子，陈庄子十个团员互助生产，比去年多种了十二亩麦子，一人两天半的时间就节省了一个工。东留春团员组织的互助组十户十人，有九户是军属，组织起来以后，一年没有要村里代耕，并且庄稼收得早种得快。团员象这样的积极生产，还帮助别人，得到了群众、干部和家庭的赞扬，有一个女团员的娘说：“过去我不让她去开会，怕耽误工夫，可是从她参加了青年团又参加互助组后家里的生产困难都解决了，以后再多开会我也不管她了。”
    　　　　在冬学运动中
    在办冬学开始时，很多村里的团支部对过去村里办冬学不按大家的需要，不按文化高低编班划组或是不能很好的结合冬季生产，没有自觉的纪律等缺点作了检讨。这次他们除了政治课外，文化课都是自由结组，并且由大家讨论自选内容，自聘教员，自订纪律，结合生产自订时间，这样提高了学习情绪，扩大了学习成绩，小西乡村团员带动了六十几个青年参加了冬学，在半个月中平均每人学了三十九个字，还学会两个新歌。在全县团干部和团员的努力下，二七○个村成立了冬学，十四个区的统计，共有学员九六五二人，获得了相当大的成绩。
    其他在民主整党，征收公粮等工作中，青年团也起了很大的作用。
    　　　　青年的战斗队伍在各种运动中壮大了
    定县的青年团一年多来，经过了土改、参军、生产、冬学、民主整党等运动的锤炼，已经坚强和壮大起来了，事实证明了只要领导上注意，结合当前各种中心工作和运动来建立和壮大青年团的组织是完全可能，而且对完成中心工作能起推动作用，同时团的工作又紧密的结合着青年和家庭的切身利益，得到群众广泛的拥护，团的基础是巩固的。
    到今年二月底，定县青年团在全县四二二个村中已经建立了二二一个支部，连三三个学校支部总数已经有了二四五个团支部，根据二四四个团支部不完全的统计，就有五三七一个团员，这一支青年战斗队伍，已经成为建设新民主主义社会强大的生力军了。
