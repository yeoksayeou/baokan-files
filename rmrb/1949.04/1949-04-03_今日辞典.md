    泛浆 (Fàn jiāng) - Refers to land that has been flooded in the autumn and subsequently freezes in winter. When the weather warms up the following spring (around February), the soil loosens and the moisture thaws. At this point, the land is said to be "泛浆 (fàn jiāng)," and after a short period of time, it can be cultivated.
    摇机班 (Yáo jī bān) - When generating electricity with a DC telegraph machine, manpower is often used to crank the motor. The organization that manually cranks the motor is commonly called the "摇机班 (yáo jī bān)."
    卖犋 (Mài jù) - Also known as "卖晌 (mài shǎng)." After farmers have finished cultivating their own land, they use their livestock and farm tools to cultivate land for others or in other places in exchange for wages. Two head of livestock are called a "犋 (jù)." The practice of "卖犋 (mài jù)" was very common in mountainous and plain areas before they were divided by the enemy, because the climates of the two regions differed, and the mountainous areas had less land but more livestock. Therefore, many people went to the plains to "卖犋 (mài jù)." Although the blockade situation has changed in recent years, the lack of animal power has reduced "卖犋 (mài jù)."
    解放战士 (Jiěfàng zhànshì) - Soldiers who were captured or defected from the Kuomintang reactionary army and joined the People's Liberation Army after being educated, raising their awareness, and voluntarily participating in the cause of people's liberation are called "解放战士 (jiěfàng zhànshì)," or liberated soldiers.
    冬季生产 (Dōngjì shēngchǎn) - This refers to the Communist Party and the democratic government leading the peasants in the liberated areas to engage in production during the winter slack season. The general approach to winter production is to mobilize the peasants to organize themselves and cooperate with each other in terms of labor and capital. Based on local conditions, they transport goods if they can, dig up medicinal materials if they can, and also spin cotton, sew shoes, press oil... There are many types. The duration of winter production is about three months. Well-organized winter production can equal half a season's income for farmers, and in some areas, it often relies on winter production to overcome disasters.
