Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 20th – To strengthen its control over the Nanjing-Shanghai-Hangzhou area, the Chiang Kai-shek clique has established a Nanjing-Shanghai-Hangzhou Garrison General Headquarters Political Affairs Committee as a special ruling body for the area. The leading personnel of this institution were approved by the puppet Executive Yuan at a meeting on the 16th, and are all notorious Chiang Kai-shek die-hards. Tang Enbo, puppet Nanjing-Shanghai-Hangzhou Garrison General Commander, serves concurrently as the chairman, with Wu Guozhen, Gu Zhenggang, and Deng Wenyi as standing committee members, and Chen Liang, Zhou @, Zhang Qiang, Ding Zhipan, Gu Xiping, Teng Jie, Pan Gongzhi, Fang Zhi, Fan Zhengbo, and Lu Jingshi as committee members, and Chen Daqing as secretary-general. Observers believe that the purpose of this organization is to oppose the peace faction within the Kuomintang and to resist the People's Liberation Army from crossing the river to realize the Eight Peace Conditions, but this small group of vermin can do nothing except prepare to flee, and scare some neurasthenic people before fleeing.

Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 20th – According to a report from the Hong Kong Industrial and Commercial Daily, quoting sources in Hong Kong via the Associated Press on the 18th, the Chiang Kai-shek clique, which is fully preparing to resist stubbornly, has purchased a large number of weapons from a French company in Hong Kong. The newspaper quoted reliable sources as saying that these weapons are being delivered to Taiwan. According to a report in the Hong Kong Standard on the 29th of last month, the batch of weapons was ordered by Soong Tzu-wen.

　　蒋匪死党虚张声势
  　梦想阻挡我军渡江
  　这一小撮臭虫正准备逃跑
    【新华社北平二十日电】蒋介石死党为加强其对京沪杭地区的控制，成立了一个京沪杭警备总司令部政务委员会，作为对该地区之特殊统治机构。该机构为首人员已由伪行政院于十六日会议通过任命，全部都是臭名昭著的蒋介石死党分子。伪京沪杭警备总司令部汤恩伯兼任主任委员，吴国桢、谷正纲、邓文仪为常务委员，陈良、周＠、张强、丁治磐、顾希平、滕杰、潘公之、方治、范争波、陆京士等为委员，陈大庆为秘书长。观察家相信这个组织的企图是反对国民党内的主和派和反抗人民解放军渡江实现八项和平条件，但是这一小撮臭虫除了准备逃跑，并在逃跑以前恐吓一些神经衰弱的人们以外，什么事也办不了。
    【新华社北平二十日电】据美联社香港十八日电引该地工商日报消息披露，正在全力准备顽抗的蒋介石死党已经香港法国公司购得大量武器。该报引可靠方面消息称：这些武器正交到台湾。按上月二十九日香港标准报曾报导该批武器系由宋子文经手订购。
