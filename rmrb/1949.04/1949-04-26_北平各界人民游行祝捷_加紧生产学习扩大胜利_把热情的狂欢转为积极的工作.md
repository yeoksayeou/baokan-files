　　Beiping People from All Walks of Life Parade to Celebrate Victory
  　Accelerate Production and Learning to Expand Victory
    Turn Passionate Celebration into Active Work
    [Reported by this newspaper] Yesterday (the 25th), the people of Beiping continued their joyous celebrations of the liberation of Nanjing and Taiyuan. Workers and students expressed their intention to support the advancing People's Liberation Army with practical actions. Factories and schools participated in the celebratory parades. At night, the main thoroughfares were still filled with the sounds of gongs and drums. Three thousand employees of the Beiping-Tianjin Railway Bureau marched in demonstration, holding high portraits of Chairman Mao and shouting, "Wherever the Liberation Army advances, we will repair the railways to!" Their enthusiasm and determination moved every member of the masses. Railway workers Zhao Ke-ren and Yu Zhen-hua, who came to Beiping from Fengtai, said, "The 'May 1 Labor' locomotive that we rushed to repair will be test-driven tomorrow. This is a broken locomotive that has not been used for several years, and we repaired it in a concentrated effort. We want to support the war, and each of us will automatically work an extra hour." Workers at the Beiping China People's Printing Factory excitedly stated that they would guarantee that wherever the army advances, they would deliver the People's Currency there. They said, "The Gold Yuan notes have caused great suffering to the people in the South. We will send the People's Currency to the South to overthrow the Kuomintang's counterfeit money." Many workers tried their best to celebrate without delaying production. Workers in the leather industry in the outer five districts automatically finished a day's work in the morning and happily joined the parade in the afternoon. At the Peking University Democracy Square, a celebration meeting with more than 5,000 people was held at 6:00 PM. The meeting paid tribute to Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and the Liberation Army on the Yangtze and Taiyuan fronts. At 6:45 PM, a grand torchlight parade began. Students shouted slogans such as "Step up learning skills and go south to work." Along the route they passed, many slogans were written such as "Attack Hangzhou, attack Guangzhou, attack Taiwan." Students from Normal University also excitedly participated in the demonstration parade and decided to write letters of condolence to the victorious Liberation Army. People's emotions have gradually calmed down from excitement, and they are planning to improve their own affairs and work. Many staff members of government organizations are studying how to intensify their learning and improve the quality of their work in the face of the rapidly developing situation, and when work requires it, go to the distant South. While the reporter was on the street where the parade was celebrating in full swing, he interviewed combat heroes who came to Beiping to participate in the National Youth Congress. Tian Guang-wen, an outstanding combat hero of the "White Tiger Company" in the famous Jinzhou liberation campaign, expressed great regret that he did not have time to cross the river with his combat comrades of the past nine years. But he recognized the importance of this conference even more. He said, "I am now determined to study the reports of the leaders carefully, bring the spirit of the conference to the troops, and participate in the final battle to annihilate the Jiang bandits in the vast area south of the Yangtze River!"
    Cheng Yong-yuan, 25 years old, is from Yidong County, Luzhongnan. He has contributed the greatest strength in the People's Liberation War. For nearly two years, he carried a stretcher and fought in several provinces including Jiangsu, Shandong, Henan, and Anhui. He was selected as a model stretcher bearer. When he heard the news of the liberation of Nanjing, he immediately stated, "From now on, wherever the People's Liberation Army fights, I will carry it there!" Liu Wen-gui, a model nurse from East China, in the extremely cold weather of heavy snow during the Huaihai Campaign, took apart her quilt, disinfected it, and used it as cotton for the wounded, and covered the remaining quilt cover on the wounded. In 1947, when the Kuomintang reactionaries frantically attacked the Shandong Liberated Area, she led twelve stretchers and crossed the Wulian Mountains in Jiaodong on a snowy night, and twelve wounded were safely transferred. She sincerely said: "Although I have made some achievements in the past, I am not proud or complacent at all. These are all the achievements I have gained under the cultivation of the Party. After the meeting, I will immediately return to my post and follow the army directly to the south of the Yangtze River, wholeheartedly serving the wounded and sick!"

　　北平各界人民游行祝捷
  　加紧生产学习扩大胜利
    把热情的狂欢转为积极的工作
    【本报讯】平市人民昨（二十五）日继续狂欢庆祝南京、太原的解放。工人、学生们纷纷表示以实际行动支援前进中的解放军。各工厂、学校都参加了庆祝游行，入夜，各通衢大道还在锣鼓喧天。平津铁路局三千职工高举毛主席画像示威游行，沿路喊着：“解放军打到那里，我们把铁路修到那里。”他们的热情和决心激动了每一个群众，从丰台来到北平的铁路工人赵克仁、于振华等说：“我们赶修的‘五一劳动号’，明天就要试车了。这是一台几年不用的破机车，我们突击修好的。我们要支援战争，我们每个人要自动加工一小时。”北平中国人民印刷厂的工人兴奋之余，表示保证军队打到那里，把人民券送到那里。他们说：“金圆券把江南的老乡们害苦了。我们把人民券送到江南去，打倒国民党的伪票子。”许多工人尽量作到庆祝而不误生产，外五区制革业的工人自动在上午赶完一天的工作，下午欢快的参加到游行的行列中。在北大民主广场，下午六时举行了五千多人的庆祝大会。大会向毛主席、朱总司令及长江、太原前线的解放军致敬。六时三刻起，开始了盛大的火炬游行。学生们高呼：“加紧学本事、南下工作去”的口号。在他们经过的路上，书写着许多“打到杭州、打到广州、打到台湾”的标语。师大的同学们同样兴奋的参加了示威游行，并决定每人写一封慰问信，送给胜利前进的解放军。人们的情绪已逐渐由兴奋而冷静下来，计划改进自己的事情和工作。不少机关工作人员正在研究在迅速发展的形势之前，如何加紧学习，提高工作质量，而在工作需要的时候，就开往遥远的南方。记者在街上游行庆祝热火朝天的时候，访问了此次来平参加全国青年代表大会的战斗英雄。在著名的解放锦州作战中，“白老虎连”杰出的战斗英雄田广文，对于此次没有来得及和自己九年来的战斗同伴一块渡江，表示十分惋惜。但是他更认识到这次大会的重要，他说：“我现在决心好好的学习各位首长的报告，把大会的精神带到部队中去，在长江南岸广大的地区里，参加歼灭蒋匪的最后一战！”
    二十五岁的程永元，是鲁中南沂东县人，他在人民解放战争中贡献了最大的力量。在将近两年的时间里，抬着担架转战苏、鲁、豫、皖数省，被选为担架模范。这次听到南京解放的消息，当即表示：“今后，人民解放军打到哪里，我就抬到哪里！”华东模范护士刘文桂，在淮海战役中，下着大雪的奇寒天气，曾将自己的被子拆开，经过消毒，充作伤员的药棉，又将剩下的夹被单给伤员盖上。一九四七年国民党反动派疯狂进攻山东解放区时，她曾带着十二付担架，在一个下雪的夜里，翻过胶东的五连山，十二个伤员得以安全转移。她诚恳的说：“我过去虽然工作有些成绩，我一点也不骄傲，不自满，这都是在党的培育下得到的一点成绩。开完了会，我马上要回到工作岗位上，随军直下江南，全心全意为伤病员服务！……”
