　　Unauthorized Sale of Confiscated Goods
  　Han Xinquan Receives a Demerit
    [Taiyue Electric] Han Xinquan, the former secretary of the Fourth Branch of the Industry and Commerce Tax Bureau, in December of last year, when the industry and tax organs were changing, violated the regulation that "all confiscated items shall be handed over to the district bureau for disposal," and without authorization sold the confiscated items stored in the bureau to cadres of various organs and small vendors at low prices. Compared with the market price at the time, the public suffered a loss of approximately 161,240+ yuan in Renminbi. The department believes that as a secretary in an important position, this comrade disregarded the instructions and decisions of the higher authorities and acted arbitrarily, knowingly violating the rules, which is a kind of unorganized and undisciplined behavior. For this reason, the Taiyue Administrative Office submitted a request to the North China People's Government for approval to give the comrade a demerit and to issue a notice throughout the region as a warning.

　　擅自出卖没收物品
  　韩新泉记大过一次
    【太岳电】原工商税务四分局秘书韩新泉，于去年十二月份，工税机关变动时，违背“凡没收之物品，统交区局处理”之规定，擅自将该局所存没收品，以贱价出卖给各机关之干部及小商贩，与当时市价相比，公家亏损约合人民币十六万一千二百四十余元。部署认为该同志身为秘书要职，竟不顾上级指示决定，擅做主张，明知故犯，实为一种无组织无纪律行为。为此太岳行政公署呈请华北人民政府批准，给该同志记大过一次之处分，并通令全区以警效尤。
