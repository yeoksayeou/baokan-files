　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 27th: According to reports from various sources: The Shanghai Kuomintang bandit gang frenziedly slaughtered and arrested people on the eve of its destruction. Shanghai citizens Liu Jinshan and Yan Peifu were shot on the 25th by the pseudo-Songhu Garrison Command with the fabricated charge of "spreading rumors to confuse the public." At midnight on the same day, the pseudo-Songhu Garrison Command brazenly announced a so-called "emergency order," dispatching a large number of military police and secret agents to universities such as Jiaotong and Fudan to arrest students, and handed over blacklists to the universities. The reactionary school authorities even handed over students according to the lists. As of the 26th, four to five hundred students from various universities in Shanghai had been arrested, including about sixty students from one university alone. St. John's University was occupied by Kuomintang bandit troops on the 25th.
