　　Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan Front, 21st: Laborers from the North China, Jin-Sui, and Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Liberated Areas are gathering at the Taiyuan front lines, actively supporting the People's Liberation Army in attacking Taiyuan. Before departing, laborers from all regions fully prepared various transportation equipment suitable for mountainous terrain and full gear suitable for battlefield life. After arriving at the front lines, they watched the enemy's artillery fire and helped the People's Liberation Army to transform the terrain, build fortifications, and transport ammunition and equipment. The stretcher team from Shenze County, Jizhong, after passing through the enemy's artillery blockade to reach the position, dug more than twenty zhang of communication trenches and more than eighty bulletproof ditches overnight. The labor team from Ningjin County, Jizhong, after just arriving at the front lines, practiced martial arts and mountain climbing with the troops, and learned basic battlefield military knowledge such as air defense, anti-poisoning, and first aid, and conducted exercises. The second squad of stretcher bearers from the county requested to their superiors to take on first-line rescue tasks, and launched a competition to all the laborers at the Taiyuan front, determined to serve the army and earn merits on the front lines. The stretcher teams and cart transport teams from nineteen counties in Jinzhong have been assigned tasks in batches and are concentrated at designated locations. In just a few days, laborers from Pingyao, Taigu, and other four counties alone completed the task of transporting 10,000 wooden strips and 5,000 wooden boards to the front lines. A large cart transport team composed of Chahar and other regions is now fully loaded with grain, continuously supplying the front lines. Labor teams from the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region and Jingle and Guoxian counties in Jin-Sui have also recently rushed to the Taiyuan front lines and have joined forces with brother laborers from all over North China.
