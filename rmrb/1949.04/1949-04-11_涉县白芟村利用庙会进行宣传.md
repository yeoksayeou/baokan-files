　　Shexian Baituan Village
  　Using Temple Fair for Propaganda
    [Taihang News] In Shexian's Seventh District, the fifteenth day of the second lunar month is the old temple fair period. District leaders are taking advantage of this old custom to carry out propaganda work. Before the gathering, new slogans were written, and the Seventh Elementary School prepared a "Beasts Seeking Peace" square performance and set up three exhibition halls for current events, hygiene, and student achievements. Chen Qingshou, a demobilized soldier from the village, stood under the current affairs map and automatically explained current events to the audience, describing the victorious situation and exposing the Kuomintang reactionaries' fake peace conspiracy. The "How to Raise Children" cartoons in the hygiene hall provided the masses with a lot of hygiene knowledge about infant care, and approximately 4,500 people visited the temple fair in three days.

　　涉县白芟村
  　利用庙会进行宣传
    【太行讯】涉县七区白芟村阴历二月十五为旧庙会期，区领导上利用此种旧习展开宣传工作。大会前换写了新标语，七完小准备了“野兽求和”的广场剧，并布置了时事、卫生、学生成绩三个展览馆。该村退伍军人陈庆寿站在时事地图下自动向观众讲解时事，说明胜利形势，揭露国民党反动派的假和平阴谋。卫生馆的“怎样养孩子”漫画，使群众获得不少育婴养孩的卫生常识，三天的庙会参观的约有四千五百多人。
