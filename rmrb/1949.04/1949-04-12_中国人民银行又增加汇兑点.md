    [This newspaper reports] Since the People's Bank of China's Beiping branch began handling remittances to various locations, it has played a role in regulating local finances. According to statistics, from March 17th to April 9th, RMB 24,007,813 was remitted from Beiping, and RMB 21,094,699.68 was remitted from various locations to Beiping. In order to continue expanding the remittance business, in addition to adding Handan as a remittance point on the 11th, the bank plans to add Shanhaiguan, Jinan, Zhengzhou, Kaifeng, Linqing, and Dezhou as remittance points in the near future. In areas where there are no branches of the People's Bank of China, the bank's offices will handle remittances. A remittance network covering the entire liberated area is about to be formed.
