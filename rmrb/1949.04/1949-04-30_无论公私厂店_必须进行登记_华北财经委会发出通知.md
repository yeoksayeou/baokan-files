　　Regardless of Whether Public or Private Factories and Stores,
  　Registration is Mandatory
  　Notification Issued by the North China Financial and Economic Committee
    [Report from this newspaper] The North China Financial and Economic Committee has issued a notification regarding the mandatory registration of public and private factories and stores. The notification states: According to the "Provisional Measures for Industrial and Commercial Registration in the North China Region," all factories and stores, whether public or private, must register with the local industrial and commercial authorities. It has recently been discovered that some state-owned factories and stores, as well as factories and stores run by government agencies, are unwilling to comply with registration, which is unacceptable. In order to understand the overall situation of industry and commerce in the region, study the development trends of public and private economies, and develop the national economy, it is hoped that this will be conveyed to all subordinate factories and stores, requiring them to register with the local industrial and commercial authorities. Some foreign representatives, along with the French representatives, are traveling throughout France. In Rouen, thousands of residents held a rally, where Polish representative Zwieck gave a speech. In Marseille, citizens broke through police barriers to hold a rally, where American representative Torbert Kahn and Tunisian representatives Mouhannod and Rade spoke. A crowded rally was also held in Limoges (central-western France), where Soviet representative Fadeyev and Greek writer Asoti delivered speeches. Soviet representative Ehrenburg delivered a speech at a rally in Lyon. The French Women's Union issued a communique stating that French women within the union must live up to the trust placed in them by the world and continue the struggle for peace and democracy with unwavering determination.
