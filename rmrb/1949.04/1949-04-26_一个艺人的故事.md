The Story of an Artist
　　Luo Lun
　　Gao Huailin was an artist from the old society. Since childhood, his family was very poor. He often pushed a small cart with his mother sitting on it, going to the countryside to escape famine.
　　He himself had suffered from hunger and cold; he also saw many poor people suffering from hunger and cold. He felt that the world was unequal. He thought day and night, "How can everyone be equal, with no oppressors and no oppressed?" He couldn't find a good solution, so he learned to read, studied morality books, and recited scriptures. He thought that "Buddha" could save him and others.
　　He shut himself in his room, knelt on the cold brick floor, learned to recite morality books, and tried to find a way to save people, save himself, and save the world from them. He racked his brains, but still couldn't find it; if he couldn't find it, he would still rack his brains. Thinking it over and over, he became silly, turned into a fool, a half-mad, half-idiotic person. One day, he went to the market and saw someone buying several sheep. He was afraid that the sheep would be killed. He felt that all things should live well and that no one should harm anyone. So he stole a sheep and took it away in the dark of night. Later, he was discovered and chased, and the sheep was taken back.
　　He lived this half-mad, half-foolish life for many years. Many times, he almost starved to death.
　　Later, the Eighth Route Army came, and the village began to implement land reform, struggling against feudal landlords. He felt a glimmer of hope in his mind, thinking that the Eighth Route Army was fighting the landlords to save the poor.
　　As land reform was carried out more deeply and universally, the poor people turned over, and were given land, houses, and fruits. He felt that this method was very good. He thought, "If there are no oppressors in the world, then there will naturally be equality."
　　To make a living, he learned to paint portraits very early. He had a gentle personality, a meticulous mind, and skillful hands. The portraits he painted were very lifelike. Many wealthy people asked him to paint portraits. He painted them well, and they gave him a little money, barely enough to eat a bowl of rice. Since the land reform, the landlords no longer asked him to paint portraits, and he had no opportunity to use his skills.
　　Just then, the Folk Art Department of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Liberated Area wanted to train old artists, and he volunteered to participate. The cadres of the art department were very kind to him, and he felt warmth and peace. The pain that had been suppressed in his heart for a long time slowly came out, and it felt like a major illness had been removed from his heart. His mind felt clearer, his heart was brighter. Living together, he heard many principles such as "Artists must turn over, must no longer serve the feudal landlords, and must serve the people." He felt that these principles were even better and more practical than what the morality books said. He thought, "What's the use of morality books? I've read them for many years and still can't find a way to save people."
　　He understood some principles and was no longer mad or foolish, but he couldn't find a way to serve the people. Everyone encouraged him and reminded him: "You can learn to paint portraits of Chairman Mao!" He was happy and enlightened: "Chairman Mao is the savior of the people. If I can paint Chairman Mao, I am serving the people."
　　He began to paint portraits of Chairman Mao. He painted many, and they became better and better, more and more refined. Later, he also painted portraits of Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and also learned to paint New Year pictures. He has been detached from production and has been working in the art department for two years. Last year, when creating New Year pictures, he painted several and also helped artists mix colors, trace patterns, and print. He worked very hard.
　　He threw away those morality books long ago and reads newspapers, studies, and is convinced that "I must always follow the Communist Party." He often said: "When will I be able to see Chairman Mao? If I can see Chairman Mao, I will definitely be able to paint his portrait even better!"

　　一个艺人的故事
    罗伦
    高怀林是一个旧艺人，从小家里很穷，常推着一辆小车，叫他娘坐在上面，到四乡去逃荒。
    他自己挨过饿，受过冻；也看见很多穷人，挨着饿，受着冻。他感到世界是不平等的，他日日夜夜地想，“怎样才能叫人人平等，没有压迫人的也没有受压迫的呢？”他找不到好办法，于是他学认字，学念善书，念经文，他想着“佛”能救他，也能救别人。
    他闷在房子里，跪在冷砖头上，学念善书，想从上面找救人、救己、救世的方法。他苦用思想，还是找不到；找不到，还是苦用思想。想来想去，想傻了，变成了呆子，变成了一个半疯半痴的人。一天去赶集，看见有人买了几只羊，他怕把羊杀掉了，他觉得万物都该好好地活着，谁也不该残害谁，于是他偷了一只羊，黑天半夜的把羊带走了，后来，被人家发觉，追上去又要走了。
    这样半疯半傻的生活，他一直过了好多年，多少次，差点儿饿死。
    后来，八路军来了，村里开始实行土地改革，斗争封建地主，他思想里感到一点明路，觉得八路军是打地主救穷人的。
    土地改革更深入普遍地进行了，穷人都翻了身，分了土地、房屋、果实，他感到这个办法很好，他想“世上没有压迫人的了，自然就能平等了”。
    他为了糊口，很早学会了画像。他的性格很温和，心很细，手很巧，画出像来，很象似。很多有钱的人，找他画像，他画好了，人家给他一点钱，勉强吃碗饭。自从土地改革以后，地主们都不再找他画像了，他这份手艺也就没有使用的机会。
    恰好，冀鲁豫解放区民间艺术部要训练旧艺人，他自动去参加了。艺术部的干部对他很亲热，他感到温暖，感到安静。他长久压抑在内心里的痛苦，慢慢地都吐诉出来，心里仿佛除下了一块大病。思想觉得清醒了，心里亮了，大家生活在一起，听到了很多“艺人要翻身，不能再替封建地主服务，要给人民服务”的道理。他感到这些道理比善书三说的还好，还切实，他想“善书有啥用处呢？看了好多年也找不出救人的方法”。
    他懂得了一些道理，也不疯痴了，但他找不出为人民服务的路。大家都鼓励他、提醒他：“你可以学画毛主席像呀！”他高兴了，想开了：“毛主席是人民的救星，我能画毛主席，正是为人民服务。”
    他开始画毛主席像，画了好多张，越画越好，越画越精细。以后，他又画朱总司令像，也学画新年画。他已脱离生产，在艺术部工作够两年了，去年创造新年画，他画了好几张，还帮助艺人调色、描版、印刷，工作很卖力。
    那些善书本，他早扔掉了，整天看报、学习、认定了“永远要跟着共产党走”。他常说：“我啥时候能看见毛主席呢？能看到毛主席，我一定更能把他的像画好！”
