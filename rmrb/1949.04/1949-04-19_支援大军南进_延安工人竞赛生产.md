  　Yan'an Workers Compete in Production
    Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, 17th. Yan'an workers, government organs, and organizations are taking practical actions to support the People's Liberation Army's southward advance. The Northwest Printing Factory launched a production competition, and its output in ten days exceeded that of March by a quarter. More than ten tailors in Yan'an City assisted the clothing factory day and night in rushing to produce military uniforms for the People's Liberation Army, and have now completed more than 8,000 sets of military uniforms. The First Troupe of the Northwest Literary and Art Troupe is creating songs, dramas, and studying literary and artistic policies, and is preparing for publicity activities in newly liberated cities. The Northwest Party School of the Chinese Communist Party is stepping up its study of urban policies to lay a solid foundation for future urban work.
