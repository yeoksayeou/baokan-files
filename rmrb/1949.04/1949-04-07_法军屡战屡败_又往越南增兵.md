Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 4th: According to a Paris Morning Post report by Agence France-Presse on the 2nd, in view of the repeated defeats of the French army in Vietnam, the French authorities have decided to send the Chief of Staff of the French Ministry of Defense, Rivet, to Vietnam to study the issue of changing combat methods, especially regarding decentralized combat methods. It is reported that the French government has also decided to send an additional ten battalions of French troops, carrying five hundred various vehicles and a number of fighter planes to Vietnam; some of them have already departed. This is a prelude to the return of the Vietnamese traitor Bảo Đại to Vietnam in mid-April.
