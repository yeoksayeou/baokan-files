　　Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, 10th. Outstanding sons and daughters of the people from various liberated areas are enthusiastically joining the People's Liberation Army, preparing to advance on the South of the Yangtze River and liberate the 200 million compatriots in Jiangnan. Statistics from the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu, Ji-Zhong, and Subei Yanhudistricts alone show that nearly 40,000 people have joined the army and returned to their units in recent months. In addition to over 10,000 young and strong people joining the army in Jin-Lu-Yu, in the nine counties of the Subei Yanhudistrict, 16,900 people enlisted in the twenty-five days from February 10th to March 5th, of which more than a quarter, or 4,660, were local cadres and Communist Party members. Since February, over 7,300 young and strong people in the Ji-Zhong district have joined the army and returned to their units. In carrying out the army enlistment movement in various places, the victorious situation has been linked with universal education on "carrying the revolution through to the end." The people who have undergone this education have deeply understood the current victorious development of the revolution and, from the pain they themselves suffered under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang in the past, have been reminded of the broad masses of compatriots who are still under the oppression of the Kuomintang reactionaries today. They are determined to join and strengthen the People's Liberation Army, advance on the South of the Yangtze River, thoroughly realize Chairman Mao's eight peace conditions, and liberate all the people of the country.
