Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 15th: Reports from various sources indicate that the British House of Commons passed the "guns before butter" budget for this year (from April 1st to the end of March next year) on the night of the 12th by a vote of 302 to 3. The three dissenting votes were cast by Communist MPs Gallacher and Piratin, and former Labour MP Mr. Mills. All Conservative MPs in the House of Commons abstained, as did twelve Labour MPs. Prior to this, when Attlee attended a Labour Party conference in Glasgow from the 10th, many people demonstrated outside the venue. Demonstrators demanded the withdrawal of the hunger budget, cuts in military spending, and trade with the Soviet Union. Attlee did not dare to meet with representatives of the demonstrators and sneaked into the secret room of the venue through a side door.

The abstention of the Conservatives, led by warmonger Churchill, is clearly due to the upcoming general election next year. The Conservatives are attempting to deceive British voters with this ambiguous attitude. In the recent two weeks of British county council elections, the Conservatives have taken the lead in the counties of England and Wales, and have defeated the Labour Party's fifteen-year control of the London County Council. It is reported that the Labour Party's defeat in the county council elections is mainly due to the British people's dissatisfaction with the Labour Party's new budget, which lowers living standards.

### 英国人民示威　要求撤回饥饿预算

　　英国人民示威
  　要求撤回饥饿预算
    【新华社北平十五日电】各方报导：英国下院已于十二日夜以三百零二票对三票通过克利浦斯提出的“大炮代替牛油”的今年度（自四月一日至明年三月底）预算案。投反对票的三人为共产党议员加拉赫与皮拉丁及前英工党议员米尔斯。下院保守党议员全体弃权，工党议员也有十二名弃权。在此以前，当艾德礼十日至格拉斯哥参加工党会议时，会场门外有许多人示威。示威者要求撤回饥饿预算，削减军事开支，并要求与苏联进行贸易。艾德礼不敢见示威者代表，偷偷地从侧门溜入会场的密室。
    以战争贩子邱吉尔为首的保守党的弃权，显然是鉴于明年大选行将到来，保守党企图以这种暖昧的态度来欺骗英国选民。在最近两周的英国郡议会选举中，保守党已在英格兰、威尔士各郡占先，并击败了工党十五年来对伦敦郡议会的控制。据悉，工党在郡议会选举中的失败，近因为英国人民对工党降低生活水准的新预算的不满。
