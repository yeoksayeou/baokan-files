Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 19th. The Headquarters and Political Department of the Third Field Army of the Chinese People's Liberation Army recently sent a letter on behalf of the entire army to the people of the two major liberated areas of East and Central China, expressing their determination to repay the people's solicitations and hopes with new victories. The letter expressed heartfelt gratitude for the hard work of various organizations and people in East and Central China during the Huaihai Campaign, who actively supported the army and ensured the smooth completion of its combat missions. The letter stated: Workers in cities such as Jinan, Kaifeng, Xuzhou, Zhengzhou, and Luoyang saved wages, and workers from the Mining Department of the East China Financial and Economic Office donated one day's wages, all to express solicitude to the troops. Men and women farmers from various places sent large quantities of vegetables, pigs, sheep, shoes, socks, and comfort bags to the front lines, undeterred by long journeys. Some comfort bags contained a pair of handcuffs and a rope, asking the People's Liberation Army to capture the war criminal Chiang Kai-shek; others contained two dates, meaning they wanted the People's Liberation Army to liberate all of China "sooner rather than later." These clearly illustrate the rear area people's eagerness for the rapid liberation of the entire country and their love for their own troops. In addition to heartfelt gratitude, the entire army is now intensively preparing to cross the river to the south, stepping up military training, studying policies, and improving the military and political level of the troops, in order to cooperate with fraternal corps and answer the people's solicitations and hopes with the victory of liberating the entire country.

  　第三野战军致书华东华中人民
    【新华社济南十九日电】中国人民解放军第三野战军司令部、政治部，顷代表全军致书华东、中原两大解放区人民，表示将以新的胜利答谢人民的慰问与希望。信中对淮海战役中华东、中原各机关团体和人民不畏艰辛，积极支援，保证部队顺利完成作战任务的劳绩，表示衷心感激。信上说：济南、开封、徐州、郑州、洛阳等各城市工友节约工资，华东财经办事处矿工部工友献出一天工资，各地机关节余伙食菜金，慰劳部队。各地男女农民把大批蔬菜、猪羊、鞋袜和慰问袋，不辞千里跋涉地送来前线。有些慰问袋里放了一付手铐和一条绳，要解放军把战犯头子蒋介石捉起来；有的慰问袋里放了两个枣子，意思是要解放军“早早”解放全中国。这些很清楚地说明了后方人民要求迅速解放全国的热望和对自己队伍的热爱。全军除了衷心感谢以外，现正紧张地进行渡江南进的准备工作，加紧练兵习武，学习政策，提高部队的军事水平和政治水平，以配合兄弟兵团，用解放全国的胜利来回答人民的慰问与希望。
