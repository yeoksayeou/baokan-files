Ping City First Machine Factory
  Processing and Rushing to Boost Production
    [Ping City News] The production campaign launched by the First Machine Factory in our city to welcome "May Day" and support the southward movement has achieved considerable results as of the 18th, and is still expanding. The forging department originally planned to complete a task in twelve and a half days (two hundred and eighteen work units), but successfully completed it in six days (eighty work units). Casting Team One was supposed to have seven or eight workers, but they used five people and one apprentice to do the same work. By the 18th, they had completed 80% of the total work, and also made thirteen copper tiles, one large tool rest, fourteen small tool rests, as well as chucks, copper rods, and other items. In order not to delay the work of the machinists, they also held group meetings and decided to start the fire earlier. The machinist department also held meetings to discuss and express opinions, proposing to use soap water instead of machine oil to save materials in addition to united production. The carpentry department originally planned to use more than two hundred and ten work units of labor, but completed it in one hundred and seventy work units. In order not to delay the army's southward advance, they worked overtime repairing guns overnight. In order not to delay the work of the sand molders, the carpenters rushed to make wooden molds. Workers in the fitter department still worked for several hours after get off work. Some workers in the milling department went to work at 4:30 AM to rush work (original work time was 7:30 AM). In order to improve quality, they also adopted methods of mutual supervision, inspection, and mutual assistance. The engineering section rushed to make drawings and also voluntarily increased night work. Although there are many such model facts, the development is not balanced enough, and continued efforts are needed in the future.

　　平市第一机器厂
  　加工赶活闹生产
    【平市讯】本市第一机器厂为了迎接“五一”，支援南下而发动的生产运动，截至十八日止，已获相当成绩，并仍在继续扩大。锻工部原计划十二天半（二百十八个工）能完成的任务，六天（八十个工）即胜利完成。铸工一班应有七、八个工人工作，但他们用五个人和一个工徒即同样工作，到十八日已完成全部工作的百分之八十，并加作铜瓦十三付，大刀架子一个，小刀架子十四个，及卡盘、铜棍等多件。他们为了不误机工工作，并开了小组会，决定提前点火。机工部也开会讨论并发表意见书，提出除团结生产外，并用胰子水来代替机油，节省材料。木工部原定用二百一十多个工的活，一百七十个工即完成，为了不误军队南下，他们曾连夜加班修装枪支。为了翻砂不误工作，木工急着赶造木型。钳工部下班后仍工作数小时。铣工部有些工人四点半就上班赶作（原为七点半上班）。为了提高质量，他们并采用了互相督促检查与互相帮助的办法。工务科赶着制图，也曾自动增加夜工。这种模范事实虽然很多但发展还不够平衡，需要今后继续努力。
