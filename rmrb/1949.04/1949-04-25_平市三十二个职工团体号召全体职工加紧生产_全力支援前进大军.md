It stated: "Workers of Beiping! The Kuomintang reactionaries are unwilling to have peace. They have challenged the people of the whole country. There is only one attitude we can take now: to cross the Yangtze River, capture the war criminals headed by Chiang Kai-shek who are stubbornly unrepentant, thoroughly eliminate all Kuomintang reactionary troops who dare to resist, and liberate all of China. We firmly support the orders of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and support the People's Liberation Army's expedition to the south of the Yangtze River. We call on all workers in the city to restore production, develop production, and use our strength, our sweat, and the wisdom of our working class to support the People's Liberation Army."
