　　North China People Actively Build and Support the Front Lines
  　Constructing Hundreds of Highway Bridges

　　[Reported by this newspaper] In order to support the front lines and engage in long-term construction, the broad masses of the people in the North China liberated areas are actively building highways and bridges. Workers and farmers who have been liberated, under the victorious situation nationwide, have built over a hundred large bridges and over forty culverts on the rivers, mountain streams, and gullies crossed by twenty-six highways in the past year with unparalleled construction enthusiasm. On the Shijiazhuang-Fuping highway via Pingshan, twenty-five large bridges and twelve culverts have been built. On the Qu-Xin highway from Shizui to Wutai, seventeen large bridges have been built. On the Ping-Han highway from Beiping to the Yellow River, which is over 1,200 li long, a bridge with twenty-four arches has been erected. More than ten large stone bridges are found on the Han-Chang highway (from Handan to Changzhi), which passes through layered mountains. This fully demonstrates the greatness of the people's power and the creativity of the people in the liberated areas. The Changcun large stone bridge in the Licheng-Lucheng section features a bridge built on top of another bridge, is seventy-five meters long and over twenty meters high, is grand in scale. In addition, there is the Cunbei tunnel in Weijiazhuang, which is over seventy meters long. On the Zhuozhang River, where the Shiliao of Lucheng and the Baimaling of Licheng stand tall, there is a forty-one-meter-long Howe truss steel bridge, unprecedented in history. The people fully demonstrated their enthusiasm as masters of the country in the construction of bridges and highways. Workers launched fervent revolutionary competitions in their work, persisting even during heavy snowstorms and adding night shifts. When building the large pontoon bridge at Nanguantao, over thirty civilian boats voluntarily participated in the bridge construction. Workers overcame all difficulties in engineering and materials, completing the tasks ahead of schedule. Many commissioners and county heads in Ji-Lu-Yu and Ji'nan also personally participated in this work. On the Ping-Han, Ping-Da, Jin-Pu and other highways, there are river beaches, marshlands, and saline-alkali lands that stretch for over a hundred li. For long-term construction, they are currently being repaired and paved. One to two hundred vehicles, and sometimes more than five hundred, pass daily on the Ping-Da and Ping-Han highways. The People's Liberation Army is passing through these highways and bridges, advancing southward in a mighty force.
