(Ping City News) The First Branch of the North China Agricultural Machinery Factory (No. 9 Luchang Street, North Gate of Xianongtan, Beiping), was established by reorganizing the former "Beiping Branch of the Pest and Disease Control Machinery Manufacturing Experimental Factory of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry" of the puppet regime. Before liberation, all machines in the factory were at a standstill. After liberation, with the government's active restoration efforts and the hard work of all employees, all machines have been able to operate flexibly and are gradually getting on the right track. Currently, the factory can produce 12,000 jin of "Rotenone Powder" (Dilis Powder) per month. This medicine has a wide range of uses in insecticidal aspects, and its effectiveness is the same as that of DDT. It is harmless to plants and has very little toxicity to humans and animals. Other agents that will soon resume production include "Mole Cricket Drug" and "Mole Cricket Drug Solution". Agents planned to be increased in production include "Lime Sulfur Mixture," "Nicotine Preparation," and "Rotenone Extract," all of which are effective agricultural pesticides for pest control in North China. The machinery manufacturing part of the factory plans to produce "Sprayers," "Dust Sprayers," and "15-horsepower Electric Rollers." Samples have been made, and raw materials have been purchased, so they can be shipped soon. In addition, the factory originally stored many insecticides and fungicides (such as lead arsenate, calcium arsenate, Cerasan, Bordeaux powder, etc.), and various sprayers, which have already been priced for sale. Now that Qingming has passed, crops are being sown one after another. If you want to prevent the spread of various insect pests and diseases, you should prepare pesticides and sprayers as soon as possible. Local governments, agricultural organizations, groups, and individual farmers can send people or write to contact for purchase. (The First Branch of the North China Agricultural Machinery Factory)

　　华北农业机械厂一分厂
  　大批制造农业用药
    【平市讯】华北农业机械厂第一分厂（北平先农坛北门禄长街九号），是接收伪“农林部病虫药械制造实验厂北平分厂”改组而设的。该厂在解放前，所有机器，均陷停顿，解放后，在政府积极进行恢复和全体职工努力下，所有机器，已能灵活运转，且逐渐走上正轨。现该厂每月可产“鱼藤粉”（地力斯粉）一万二千斤。此药在杀虫方面，用途很广，效力和滴滴涕一样，对植无害，对人畜毒性亦甚小。其他即将恢复生产的药剂有“蝼蛄药”、“蝼蛄药水物”等。预备增加生产的药剂有“硫黄合剂”、“尼古丁剂”、“鱼藤精”等，这些也都是对于华北虫害有效的防治农药。该厂制械部份，计划生产“喷雾器”、“喷粉器”、“十五马力电滚子”等，样品多已作好，原料买齐，即可出货。此外，该厂原存有许多杀虫杀菌药（如砒酸铅、砒酸钙、赛来散、波尔多粉等），和各种喷雾器，已经订价出售。现清明已过，农作物正陆续播种，如想防止各种虫害、病害的蔓延，应及早准备药剂和喷雾器，各地政府和农业机关团体以及个别农民，均可派人或写信接洽购买。（华北农业机械厂第一分厂）
