　　The Children Also Want to Go South
　　Shi Jianzhang
　　I followed the vanguard of the troops and was about to reach Dajia Village in Ding County. This village, like other liberated areas, was preparing a warm welcome for the soldiers marching south! From about a mile away, I could hear the deafening sound of gongs and drums in the village. As I entered the village, I saw the villagers in the street busily carrying water and tables. A group of children who had been waiting at the entrance of the village rushed to the front of my horse. They eagerly raised their voices and asked me, "Comrade! Is the army coming soon?"
　　Seeing these adorable children, who seemed as close to us as brothers, I smiled and said to them, "Do you like to watch soldiers? Then you should become soldiers!" As I dismounted, the children happily grabbed my horse's reins.
　　A child of twelve or thirteen approached me and said, "I'm afraid you won't want us! A few days ago, several of us signed up to join the army, but the village didn't want us, insisting that we couldn't fire guns or fight battles. But we all dare to fire guns. Comrade! Seriously, do you want us?"
　　"Good! If you want to be soldiers, you have to leave immediately, leave home, and go to the South." I put away my smile and seriously tried to scare them.
　　"That's no problem! I'll go to the village right away and leave a message for my mother." "Let's go! Let's go home and see my mother, and then we'll go..." They all shouted and jumped without hesitation, leading me to the village while holding the horse's reins.
　　The villagers in the street came to greet us, and the children proudly shouted, "You think we're too young and won't let us be soldiers, but these comrades will let us be soldiers and go with them to fight Chiang Kai-shek!"
　　An old villager handed me a bowl of hot water. I took it, smiled, thanked them, and saluted them, saying, "You are too kind."
　　The villagers quickly said, "Comrade! You are the ones who are really working hard! From the North to the South, fighting for the people!"
　　I drank two large bowls of water and took the reins from the children's hands, but the children surrounded me, not letting me leave, insisting that I take them "to be soldiers." And they said, "We've already told our mothers!"
　　At this moment, each of their round, red faces was filled with smiles, and their eyes shone with hope as they looked at me. I stroked the children's heads and said with a smile, "Little comrades! When you grow up, I will definitely come back and call you. What are your names?"
　　"My name is Liu Shengxue!" "My name is Liu Xiaolin?" "I am Zhang Xiaochun!" "…!" They rushed to report their names, not even asking if I could remember them. Some were looking down, dissatisfied, saying, "You said just now you would take us away, but now you're not taking us."
　　I mounted my horse, and the children reluctantly saw me off as I advanced south.

　　孩子们也要南下
    史建章
    我随着队伍的先头尖兵，眼看就要到定县大贾村了。这个村子也象解放区其他村子一样，准备热烈欢迎南下的健儿们！离村子还有一里来地远，就听到了村里震天响的锣鼓声。我踏进村口，就望见街心里老乡们担水抬桌忙个不停。早在村口等着的一群小孩子们，抢先跳到我马前。他们争着提高桑子，问我：“同志！队伍快到了吧！”
    我看到这些可爱的孩子，见了我们好象对哥哥一样亲切，便笑着对他们说：“你们爱看兵吗？那么你们就当兵吧！”说着跳下马来，孩子们都高兴的抢着拉住我的马缰。
    一个十二、三岁的孩子凑近我，说：“只怕你们不要俺！前两天俺们好几个报名参军，村里不要俺们，硬说俺们不会放枪，不会打仗。其实我们谁也敢放枪。同志！说真的，你们要俺们吗？”
    “好！要当兵就得立时走，离开家，到江南去。”我收住笑脸，认真的吓他们说。
    “那有什么不行！俺立刻到村里边，给俺娘留下个话。”“走！咱家去看娘一下，就走……”他们都毫不犹豫地这样嚷着、蹦着。一面牵着马缰引我到村里去。
    街心的老乡都迎上来了，孩子们便得意地嚷起来了：“你们嫌俺小，不让俺当兵，这些同志让我们当兵了，跟他们一块打老蒋去！”
    一个老乡递给我一碗热水，我接了笑着谢谢他们，给他们敬礼说：“你们太费心了。”
    老乡们忙说：“同志！你们才真太辛苦了！从北方到江南，为人民打天下！”
    我喝了两大碗水，把马缰从孩子手里拿过来，但孩子们围住我，不放我走，一定要我带他们“去当兵”。并且说：“我们已经和娘说过了！”
    这时，他们每个圆圆的红红的脸，浮起微笑，眼睛闪出希望的光芒注视着我。我摸了摸孩子们的头，笑着说：“小同志们！等你们长大了，我一定回来叫你们。你们叫什么名子？”
    “俺叫刘生学！”“我叫刘小林？”“我是张小春！”“…！”他们就抢先报着名，也不问我到底是否记得住。有几个还在低着头，不如意的说：“你刚才说带我们走，这会又不带了。”
    我骑上了马，孩子们恋恋不舍地送我向南前进了。
