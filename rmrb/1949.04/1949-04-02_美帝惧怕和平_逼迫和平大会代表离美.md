　　American Imperialism Fears Peace
  　Forces Peace Conference Delegates to Leave the US
    [Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, March 31st] The American government, which had strenuously tried to prevent foreign delegates from attending the New York Peace Conference, immediately forced foreign delegates attending the conference to leave the US after the conference concluded. According to a United Press report on the 29th, the US State Department and Justice Department clearly stated that the US does not want the delegates to travel around the US. Attorney General Clark instructed New York immigration officials to say that foreign delegates attending the conference must leave the US as soon as possible. Previously, the State Department had notified delegates from the four Eastern European countries attending the conference that their passports did not allow them to attend meetings scheduled in other cities in the United States. The US State Department and Justice Department have separately notified the delegates' countries and the delegates themselves that the delegates should leave the US immediately.

　　美帝惧怕和平
  　逼迫和平大会代表离美
    【新华社北平三十一日电】曾经竭力阻止外国代表出席纽约和平大会的美国政府，于大会结束后，即逼迫参加大会的外国代表立即离美。据合众社二十九日消息，美国国务院与司法部明白表示美国不愿意代表们游历美国。司法部部长克拉克指令纽约移民局官员说，参加会议的外国代表必须尽快离美。前此，国务院曾通知参加会议的东欧四国代表说：他们的护照不允许他们参加预定在美国其他城市举行的会议。美国国务院和司法部曾分别通知各代表的国家及本人说，代表们应即离美。
