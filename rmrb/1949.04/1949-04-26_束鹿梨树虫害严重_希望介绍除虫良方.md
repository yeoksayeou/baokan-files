[Hebei Central News] Pear trees in villages around Dachecheng and Chujiazhuang in Shulu County account for about 50% of the total cultivated land area, and most farmers rely on pears for a living. Currently, more than 80% of the pear trees in the area are suffering from insect infestations. The pests are about the size of black beans, light black in color, and are locally called "pear scorpions." In April and May (lunar calendar), they grow wings and fly, laying eggs on the trees. The larvae live in the bark over the winter. These insects prefer to eat pear leaves and flowers, often causing the flowers to wither and fall. They also secrete a silk-like substance to stick themselves to the leaves, causing the leaves to curl up to avoid wind and rain. These insects existed in previous years, but not as early or as numerous as this year. Many young pear leaves have already been eaten. According to the past experience of the local people, there is no good solution other than catching and killing them individually. However, this method is not very effective; it usually takes two people a whole day to catch all the insects on one tree. This year, because there are too many insects, the masses are very worried, and some say, "It's over, it's over," and their livelihood is in jeopardy. The local government is mobilizing the masses to kill the pests and hopes that those with experience in pest control from other regions will quickly introduce effective pest control methods.

　　束鹿梨树虫害严重
  　希望介绍除虫良方
    【冀中讯】束鹿大小车城、褚家庄一带村庄梨树占总耕地面积百分之五十左右，多数农民以梨为生。现该地百分之八十以上的梨树发生虫灾，害虫体如黑豆大小，浅黑色，当地人叫他“梨蝎子”。四五月时（旧历）生翅飞空，产卵树上，幼虫寄居树皮中过冬。该虫喜食梨叶和花，往往使花枯落；并能分泌丝状物，将身粘附叶上，使叶卷曲，以避风雨。该虫往年亦有，但不如今年生得早而且多。现不少嫩小梨叶已被食殆尽。据当地群众以往经验，除挨个捕捉杀死外，别无良策。但这种治法收效甚微，一般的两个人一天才能捕完一树。今年因虫太多，群众甚为忧虑，有的说：“完了，完了”，今年饭碗难保。该地政府正动员群众进行捕杀，并希各地治虫有经验者，迅速介绍除虫良方。　　　（刘根茂）
