　　Urgent Prevention and Control of Insect Plagues

　　Recently, a severe insect plague occurred in Ningjin County, Jizhong District. Wheat fields in the county have been widely damaged by spider mites. According to statistics from eleven villages, the severely affected wheat fields reached 16,950 mu (more than 40% of the wheat fields). More than 70% of the rape in these eleven villages has been eaten by flea beetles. In Anyang County, Taihang District, locust nymphs have spread to seventy-five villages. This is a signal of the spread of insect plagues and a serious threat to this year's great production. Preventing and controlling insect plagues has become one of the urgent tasks at present.

　　Due to the damage caused by the enemy and disasters over the past ten years, the land has not been thoroughly cultivated, making it prone to pests. In the new areas, the land was barren under enemy rule, and insect plagues were even more severe. These historical reasons affected the occurrence of insect plagues in some areas of North China last year. The large number of insect eggs left in the areas affected by insect plagues last year will inevitably lead to the recurrence of insect plagues this year. Thanks to the early attention of the leadership, the insect plagues in most areas last year were quickly eliminated. However, some areas suffered from paralysis and passivity. For example, in the first district of Shouzhang County, Jiluyu, farmers reported the insect plague to the district several times, but the district cadres continued to hold their meetings. When the disaster became severe and they were criticized by higher authorities, they took temporary measures, but the huge losses could not be recovered. "Prevention is better than cure" is the smartest approach. All localities should learn from the example of the Eighth Special District of Jizhong District, which learned from last year's lessons and held training courses on disaster prevention and insect control in advance this year, focusing on how to prevent and control spring pests. In Jianguo County, under that special district, the method of promoting the digging of noctuid pupae to prevent noctuid moths has been effective. Anyang County was alert to locust nymphs in advance, so when locust nymphs first occurred, they concentrated their efforts on a blitz attack and promoted the masses through incentive measures, preventing the locust plague from spreading and achieving considerable success in locust control.

　　Whether insect pests can be overcome depends entirely on the timely leadership of the Party and the democratic government. Therefore, in areas where insect plagues have occurred, special attention should be paid to seizing the time to eliminate them. The local Party committees and all cadres should go all out and must oppose any neglect or hesitation, and no excuses should be allowed. It is necessary to conduct in-depth mobilization among the masses, organize them to act in a unified manner, and strive for time to reduce losses. In particular, it is necessary to rely on the masses to come up with more solutions, oppose superstition, backwardness, lack of confidence, and the attitude of simply waiting for instructions from higher authorities, so as to quickly eliminate insect plagues.

### 紧急防治虫灾

　　紧急防治虫灾
    近日冀中区宁晋县发生了严重的虫灾，该县麦田普遍遭火蛛子害，据十一个村统计受害严重的麦田即达一万六千九百五十亩（占麦田百分之四十强），该十一村油菜的百分之七十以上已被猿叶虫吃光。太行区安阳县，蝗蝻已蔓延七十五村，这是虫灾蔓延的信号，是今年大生产的严重威胁，防治虫灾已成为目前紧急任务之一。
    由于十余年来敌灾的破坏，土地耕耙不周，易生害虫，新区过去在敌人统治下，土地荒芜，虫灾更重，这些历史原因就影响到去年华北有些地区发生虫灾，去年闹虫灾地区遗下大量虫卵就影响到今年必然又要出现虫灾。去年多数地区的虫灾，由于领导上的及早注意，消灭很快。但也有些地区吃了麻痹被动的亏，如冀鲁豫寿张县一区，农民几次跑到区上报告虫灾，区干部却仍开他的会。既至灾害严重，受到上级指责，才临时抓一把，而巨大损失已无法挽救。“防患于未然”，才是最聪明的办法，各地应该学习冀中区八专区的榜样，他们接受了去年的教训，今年已提前召开了防灾除虫训练班，着重研究了春季害虫如何防治，该专区建国县，推广挖步曲蛹防步曲的办法已收成效。安阳县预先即警惕着蝗蝻，所以当蝗蝻初发生时即集中力量突击，并用奖励办法推动了群众，使蝗灾未能扩大，灭蝗已获相当成绩。
    能否战胜虫害，完全决定于党与民主政府的及时领导，因此在已发生虫灾地区应特别注意抓紧时间扑灭，当地党委及全体干部，应全力以赴，必须反对任何忽视、犹豫的情绪，不容许有任何借口。对群众必须进行深入动员，组织起来统一行动，才能争取时间少受损失。尤应依靠群众多想办法，反对迷信落后、无信心及单纯等待上级的态度，才能使虫灾迅速捕灭。
