(Jizhong Electric) Farmers in Gexinzhuang, Renqiu, have always had the habit of raising female livestock to breed young animals, adding many small cattle and donkeys every year. Especially since the Jizhong Administrative Office promulgated the seven production-incentive measures, and after continuous publicity and education, the breeding of young livestock has increased even more. Last year, the village bred a total of sixteen small mules and twenty-six small calves. This year, thirty-two small calves and nine small donkeys have already been born; there are also forty-four cows and donkeys that are pregnant. Many farmers have greatly increased their wealth by breeding livestock. For example, Bian Wanjia has bred five small calves in recent years, and after selling them, bought land, increasing his land from four and a half mu to twenty-three mu. Wang Sheng's cow has given birth to ten calves in nine years, and there are many households like this. Because farmers have seen the actual benefits, the number of people raising female livestock to breed small animals is increasing year by year. Poor peasant Bian Zhenhe said, "Raising a one-year-old donkey foal can sell for more than 10,000 yuan, which is equivalent to five large bags of grain, which is better than planting several more mu of land!" Recently, the village production committee plans to add one donkey (there was originally one breeding bull) and one breeding pig.

　　阁辛庄大量繁殖牲口
  　王升养九年得十犊
    【冀中电】任邱阁辛庄农民，历来就有养母畜繁殖小牲口的习惯，年年增添不少的小牛小驴。尤其自冀中行政公署颁布了奖励生产的七项办法以后，经过不断宣传教育，繁殖小牲口的更多了。去年全村共繁殖了小骡十六个，小牛犊二十六个。今年又已经生了小牛三十二个，小驴九个；还有怀驹的牛驴共四十四个。不少农民因繁殖牲口增添了很大财富。如边万家近年来繁殖了五个小牛，卖出后买地由四亩半地增到二十三亩。王升养的母牛，九年生了十个小牛，象这样的户还很多。由于农民看到了实际好处，所以养母畜繁殖小牲口的一年比一年增加。贫农边振和说：“养一年的小驴驹，就能卖一万多元，合粮食五大口袋，比多种几亩地还强呢！”近该村生产委员会计划增添一个驴（原有一个种牛）一个种猪。
