Party Cadres in North China
Enthusiastically Participate in the Southern Expedition

[This newspaper report] (This newspaper report is replacing "本报讯" which is a placeholder for the newspaper itself as the source.) After studying documents such as "Carry the Revolution Through to the End," cadres from special districts, counties, and districts in the North China liberated areas have requested to go south to liberate the broad masses of people in Jiangnan. Many Communist Party members, responding to the call of the Party, have promoted this work. Comrade Du Rirui from Jingxing County said, "I am a person who has suffered, but now I have not only turned over economically, but the Party has also cultivated me to be a cadre. However, the people of Jiangnan are still suffering! I am willing to go south. This is a very glorious obligation for a Communist Party member, and it is a very happy thing!" Qi Fulu from Jianping County said, "I am a Communist Party member, and I must fight for the revolution to the end. Wherever the Party tells me to go, I will go!" A cadre from Kunwu County in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan area who volunteered to go south said, "Before the War of Resistance, most of the Red Army were from the South. In order to liberate our people in North China, they went through the heroic struggle of the Long March of 25,000 li, the eight-year War of Resistance, and the two-year-plus War of Liberation. Only then did our people here get liberated. Now we should help the suffering masses of Jiangnan to stand up." Before their departure, all the cadres from the First Prefectural Committee of Central Hebei who were going south sent a letter to the Central Hebei District Party Committee, guaranteeing that they would obey the organization, abide by discipline, obey commands, study hard, improve themselves, work hard, and closely connect with the masses in Jiangnan. Currently, enthusiastic farewell parties for the cadres going south have been held in various places. The Eleventh Prefectural Committee of Central Hebei also presented the cadres going south with a red flag with the words "Opening up Territory and Establishing a Career."

　　华北各地党员干部
  　踊跃参加南征
    【本报讯】华北解放区各专署、县、区干部，在学习了“将革命进行到底”等文件以后，纷纷要求南下解放江南广大人民。许多共产党员响应党的号召，推动了这一工作。井陉县杜瑞瑞同志说：“我是个受苦人现在不但从经济上翻了身，而且党培养我当了干部，可是江南人民还在受罪哩！我愿南下，这是共产党员很光荣的义务，是很高兴的一件事！”建屏县齐福禄说：“我是共产党员，要为革命奋斗到底，党叫我到哪里就去哪里！”冀鲁豫昆吾县一个自愿南下的干部说：“抗战前的红军多为南方人，为了解放咱华北人民，曾经过两万五千里长征，八年抗战，二年多解放战争的英勇斗争，咱这里人民才得到解放，现在咱应该帮助江南的劳苦群众翻身。”冀中一地委南下全体干部在出征前致书冀中区党委，保证服从组织、遵守纪律、听从指挥，好好学习，提高自己，努力工作，密切和江南群众联系。现各地都举行了热烈的欢送南下干部晚会。冀中十一地委还赠给南下干部一面“开疆立业”的红旗。
