Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 9th: After the reactionary leading group of the American Federation of Labor's attempt to split the World Federation of Trade Unions from within failed, they are now attempting to establish a separatist organization from the outside to confront the World Federation of Trade Unions. According to Agence France-Presse, the American Federation of Labor announced on the 7th that it intends to establish another "International Labor Organization." The first step in this conspiracy to undermine the solidarity of workers worldwide is to establish a temporary committee to study the issue of establishing an international labor organization. According to a report from the Telepress Agency, British Trades Union Congress General Secretary Towson revealed in a statement that trade unions controlled by right-wing Social Democrats in West Germany, Greece, and Spain will become the backbone of this "International Labor Organization." British labor traitors will serve as the link between the aforementioned three countries' trade unions and the American Federation of Labor. The upper-level leaders of the Labor Federation are acting in accordance with the intentions of the U.S. State Department and the Economic Cooperation Administration.

　　美英破坏工联阴谋失败后
  　妄图建立分裂机构
    【新华社北平九日电】美国劳工联合会的反动领导集团企图从内部分裂世界职工联合会失败之后，现在又妄想从外部建立一个对抗世界工联的分裂机构。据法新社报道：美国劳联七日通告，该会拟成立另一个“国际劳工组织”。这一破坏全世界工人团结的阴谋，第一步计划为成立一临时委员会，研究设立国际劳工组织问题。据电通社消息，英国职工大会总书记陶逊发表的声明中透露，西德、希腊和西班牙右翼社会党所控制的职工会，将成为这一“国际劳工组织”的支柱，英国的工贼则将充当上述三国职工会与美国劳联联系的纽带，劳联上层领导分子是秉承美国国务院及经合总署的意旨行事的。
