　　How to Run a Good Spare-Time School for Government Cadres?
    -- Experiences from the Rectification by the Taihang Second Prefectural Committee

    The spare-time cultural supplementary school for government cadres of the Taihang Second Prefectural Committee and the Second Administrative Office, after thorough examination and re-organization, has now been brought into order. Here are some issues from the rectification:

    I. In addition to the leadership of the Academic Committee, the school must also absorb active elements in teaching, promptly reflect the requirements and opinions of the students, and formulate a teaching plan for a certain period based on the students' level and through student discussions. The teaching content, requirements, purpose, and progress should be researched and announced so that teachers and students can implement them together. In this way, the general interest in learning is improved because it meets everyone's requirements. Some reflected: "Don't blame us for not understanding before, how can we jump into the well across the Yellow River?" This overcomes the phenomenon of teachers grabbing lessons randomly and students learning blindly.

    II. Adult learning differs from primary school students in that their memory is poor, but their comprehension is strong. The teaching staff and students are colleagues, which is a characteristic of spare-time schools. If the leadership cannot grasp this well, it will inevitably lead to a casual and unserious phenomenon. Therefore, it is necessary to correct the teaching attitude. For example, some teachers initially felt embarrassed to teach, thinking that everyone was a cadre. Especially when some students were higher in position than themselves, they became even more timid. In addition, some students did not respect the teachers enough, or demanded too much too quickly, which hindered learning. At this time, the school should help improve the teachers' courage and correct their learning attitude. Under the slogan of "teaching and learning from each other," the phenomenon of perfunctory work was overcome. Now everyone reflects: "Studying like this for a year is no simple matter!"

    III. It is very important to teach with preparation, for the teaching materials to be systematic, and for the content to suit the students' taste. For example, in the previous period, the first class of the special commissioner's branch school taught arithmetic, teaching "root extraction." As a result, it did not meet the students' requirements and was compared to "reclaiming wasteland," which felt difficult, and many even became pessimistic, thinking: "We'll never be able to learn it." After the reorganization, the amount and content of the courses were based on the needs and levels of the students. Teachers must prepare well before class, and students must also prepare, which not only saves time but also enhances learning effectiveness.

    IV. Teachers should not only explain the problems clearly but also take care of practice. In the previous stage, teachers often used the "injection" method, regardless of how the students received it, only continuing to lecture. As a result, some more complex courses made it impossible for students to understand, and with insufficient self-study and adults' weak memory, they went in one ear and out the other, and everything was forgotten after the lecture. Therefore, the allocation of lecture time must be precisely controlled, so that it can be explained clearly and there can be practice time. Otherwise, the effect is not great and it affects work. For example, some students also study during office hours.

    V. The culture of机关学员 (difficult to translate - roughly 'government agency students') is mostly cultivated after participating in work. They can read and understand books, but they cannot figure out the organization of words and sentences and the application of word meanings. Therefore, what they write is often ungrammatical, which is exactly the shortcoming that needs to be filled. Therefore, when teaching, special attention should be paid to clarifying the explanation of words and sentences and the application of word meanings.

　　怎样才能办好机关干部业余学校？
    ——太行二地委整顿的经验
    太行二地委及二专署的机关干部业余文化补习学校，经过深刻检查，重新整顿，现已纳入正规，今将整顿中几个问题介绍如下：
    一、学校除由学委会领导外，还必须吸收教学方面的积极分子，及时反映学员的要求和意见，才能根据学员水平，通过学员讨论做出一定时期的教学计划，并把学习内容、要求、目的、进度，经研究后公布出来，使教员学员共同执行。这样由于吻合了大家的要求，学习兴趣的普遍提高。有的反映说：“不怨以前咱不懂，还能隔着黄河去跳井？”并克服了教员乱抓一气的教课，学员盲目学习的现象。
    二、成人学习与小学生不同点是记忆力差，理解能力强。教学双方都是一块工作的同志，这是业余学校的特点。如领导上不能很好掌握，必然会形成不严肃，不认真的自流现象，因此必须端正教学态度。如有的教员开始上课觉着不好意思，认为大家都是干部。尤其有的学员比自己职位还高，更胆怯起来，加上有的学员对教员尊重不够，或要求太急，都障碍了学习。这时学校就帮助提高教员的勇气，端正学习态度，并在“教学相长”的口号下，克服了支差应付现象，现在大家反映说：“这样学习一年就不简单了！”
    三、有准备的教，教材要有系统，内容要适合学员口胃，这是很重要的。如前一段专署分校第一班上算术教“开方”，结果不适合学员要求，把它比作“开荒”，感到困难，甚至有好多人悲观起来，认为：“学到啥时也不行”。经整顿后，课程分量，内容，均根据学员的需要与水平。教员课前要作充分准备，学员也必须准备，既不浪费时间，又能增进学习效果。
    四、教员既要讲清问题，同时还要照顾到练习。前段教员往往是用“注入式”，不管学员接受如何，只管一直讲下去，结果有些较繁复的课程，使学员无从理解，再加自学不够，成人记忆弱，形成东耳朵进，西耳朵出，讲完了，也忘光了。因此在授课时间上要精确掌握分配，既能讲清，又能有练习时间。反之则收效不大，影响工作，如有的学员在办公时间也学习。
    五、机关学员的文化多是在参加工作后锻炼下的，看书能念也能懂，就是弄不清词句的组织与字义的应用，故写出东西，往往是辞不达意，这正是需要补起的缺陷。所以在授课时，应特别注意弄清词句的解释，与字义的应用。
