Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains Front, 12th: The people of the Dabie Mountains area enthusiastically support the southward-bound People's Liberation Army entering the area. Before the troops arrived, all the personnel of a supply station in a newly liberated district of a certain county braved wind and rain to raise 500,000 jin of rice, 650,000 jin of straw, 6,000 jin of oil, and 8,000 jin of salt for the southward-bound army. They also specially prepared 5,000 umbrellas and repaired 80 li of road. Four communications personnel in the station, all around 50 years old, worked day and night to contact and deliver letters. Communication personnel Zhu Fazhen said: "Since the New Fourth Army left, I have been looking forward to their return every day. Now that they are back, why shouldn't I work harder!" More than 30 students from a certain county, upon hearing that the army was heading south, voluntarily signed up to participate in the support work. When the troops arrived in the county, the people in each village along the way voluntarily vacated their houses and prepared straw mats, and set up tea and water refreshment stations. A certain local armed force that persisted in the struggle in the Dabie Mountains area was extremely excited to see the arrival of the large army. They voluntarily vacated their own houses for the field army to live in, and enthusiastically inquired about regular combat and the work of the troops. In their letter of appreciation to the field army, they wrote: "We will support you with all our strength so that the elder brothers can quickly cross the river and liberate all of China."

　　不分日夜递信件
  　冒着风雨筹粮草
  　大别山人民卷入支前热潮
    【新华社中原前线十二日电】大别山地区人民热烈支援进入该区的南下解放军。在部队到达前，新解放的某县某区供应站全体人员即冒着风雨为南下大军筹集了五十万斤大米，六十五万斤草，六千斤油，八千斤盐，并专门准备了五千把雨伞，修了八十里公路。该站四个五十岁上下的通讯员不分日夜四出联络和传递信件，通讯员朱法祯说：“自新四军走后，我没有一天不在盼望他们回来，现在盼来了，我为什么不加劲干呢！”某县三十余学生听说大军南下后，自动报名参加支援工作。部队到达该县时，沿途各村人民自动腾出房子和备好铺草，并设立了茶水招待站。坚持大别山地区斗争的某地方武装，见到大军到达，兴奋无比，他们自动腾出自己的住房让给野战军住，热烈地向野战军战士询问着正规作战和部队工作的情形。在他们送给野战军的慰问信上写着：“我们将以全力支援你们，使老大哥迅速渡江，解放全中国。”
