　　Ping City Trading Company Assigns Specific Personnel to Handle Grain Approval for Cooperatives
    [Ping City News] The Ping City Trading Company has changed its grain collection method and assigned specific personnel to handle grain approval for cooperatives. Previously, the grain collection for cooperatives and the trading company's entrusted stores was mixed together. Cooperatives often couldn't get their grain for several days. Every time grain was collected, there would be a dozen or twenty people waiting. Now, after changing the method, it is possible to collect the grain quickly upon arrival at the collection point. This is of great help to the cooperatives.

　　平市贸易公司设专人负责合作社批粮工作
    【平市讯】平市贸易公司改变取粮方式，设专人负责合作社批粮工作。以前合作社和贸易公司委托商店取粮是混合一起。合作社等几日都取不到手。每次取粮时都有一二十个人等着。现在改变办法后，到取粮地点很快即可取来。这对合作社帮助很大。
