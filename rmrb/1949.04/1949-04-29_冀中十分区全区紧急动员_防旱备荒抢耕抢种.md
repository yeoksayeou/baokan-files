　　Jizhong Tenth District Mobilizes Entire District Urgently to Prevent Drought, Prepare for Famine, and Rush to Cultivate and Plant

　　[Our newspaper dispatch] Reporter Zhao Gang reports: The Jizhong Tenth District, on the basis of initially completing the mobilization of the masses to resolve land issues, is now launching an emergency drought prevention, famine preparation, and rush cultivation and planting production campaign throughout the district. This district aims to alleviate the production and livelihood difficulties of the masses. At the beginning of March this year, in conjunction with spring plowing work, the masses were mobilized to initially resolve land issues. In just over a month, considerable progress has been made in production. However, there are still many obstacles and difficulties in the current production work: (1) Many cadres underestimate the leadership of production, some emphasize that the masses have no habit of planting special crops, and lack confidence in completing tasks. (2) Among the masses, there is a widespread mentality of waiting and relying on the heavens for food, believing that cultivation is impossible without rain and that wells cannot be dug in sandy land. In particular, many masses have concerns about planting special crops, fearing that there will be no market for cotton and peanuts, and fearing that the government will collect them at low prices, making it difficult to implement planting plans. (3) This district has suffered from exploitation and extortion by the enemy and puppets for several years, and production materials are very scarce. In addition, most of the masses in sandy wasteland areas do not have the habit of digging wells for watering and planting, forming a major obstacle to production.
    In view of the above situation, the District Committee specially convened an enlarged cadre meeting of county secretaries and county heads, and formulated an emergency production plan for drought prevention, famine preparation, and rush cultivation and planting, emphasizing that the Tenth District has been fully liberated for less than half a year, the masses are extremely short of production materials, and coupled with the drought, it is an arduous task to complete the restoration of production this year. Therefore, the entire party, army, and people should be urgently mobilized to overcome all difficulties and mobilize the masses to complete this task. Currently, we should first focus on digging wells and opening canals, and planting special crops on time to prevent the delay of farming time due to drought. In areas where special crops are not planted, we should launch a concentrated effort on general crops. In the process, we should earnestly solve the difficulty of seeds. In addition to the cotton and peanut seeds loaned by the district to the counties, the main thing should be to mobilize farmers to exchange and borrow from each other, correcting and preventing the erroneous idea of simply relying on the higher authorities. Leaders should pay attention to organizing farmers for mutual assistance and labor exchange to solve the difficulty of lacking manpower and livestock. Finally, on how to mobilize all forces to ensure the victorious completion of the production task, after repeated discussions at the meeting, it was determined that the county committees should formulate specific plans and then convene farmer representative conferences in various areas to dispel the cadres' underestimation of production leadership and the masses' backward thinking of "relying on the heavens for food," as well as various concerns about planting special crops. Educate party members and cadres on how to lead production. Mobilize women to participate in field labor. Hold three meetings in the village (branch meeting, farmers' association, mass meeting), and organize according to the production tasks. Establish a village production committee on the basis of the farmers' association to uniformly lead the production of the entire village.

　　冀中十分区全区紧急动员
  　防旱备荒抢耕抢种
    【本报讯】记者赵刚报导：冀中十分区在初步完成发动群众解决土地问题的基础上，全区正开展紧急防旱备荒、抢耕抢种的生产运动。该分区为解除群众生产和生活的困难。今年三月初结合春耕工作，发动群众初步解决土地问题。在短短的一个多月中，生产已获相当成绩。但当前生产工作中仍存在不少障碍和困难：（一）不少干部轻视生产领导，有些强调群众无种特种作物习惯，而缺乏完成任务信心。（二）在群众中普遍存在着靠天吃饭的等待思想，认为天旱无雨不能耕种，沙土地不能挖井。特别是不少群众对种植特种作物有顾虑，怕种了棉花、花生没销路，怕政府低价征收等，这样使种植计划难于实现。（三）该区数年来受敌伪的压榨勒索，生产资料甚为缺乏。加上沙荒地一般群众多又没打井浇地点种习惯，形成生产上的一大障碍。
    根据上述情况，地委特召集县书、县长扩大干部会议，制订紧急防旱备荒和抢耕抢种的生产计划着重指出：十分区全部解放不到半年，群众生产资料极为缺乏，加上天旱不雨，今年要完成恢复生产，是一个艰巨的任务。因此全党全军全民应紧急动员起来，克服一切困难，发动群众完成这一任务。当前首先应抓紧打井开渠，按时点种特种作物，防止天旱不雨误了农时。不种特种作物地区，应突击一般作物。进行中应认真解决籽种困难，除分区贷给各县的棉籽花生种应及时贷下以外，主要应是发动农民互换互借，纠正与防止单纯依赖上级的错误思想。领导应注意组织农民变工互助，解决人畜力缺乏困难。最后关于如何动员全体力量保证生产任务的胜利完成，经过大会的反复讨论，确定各县委具体制订出计划后，分片召开农民代表大会，打通干部轻视生产领导和群众“靠天吃饭”的落后思想，以及种植特种作物的各种顾虑。教育党员干部如何领导生产。发动妇女参加田间劳动。到村召开三个会（支部会、农会、群众大会），根据生产任务进行组织起来。在农会的基础上建立村生产委员会，统一领导全村生产。
