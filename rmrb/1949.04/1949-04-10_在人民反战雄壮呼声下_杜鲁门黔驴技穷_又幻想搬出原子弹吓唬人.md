　　Amidst the People's Mighty Anti-War Cries,
    Truman Runs Out of Tricks
  　And Fantasizes About Using the Atomic Bomb to Scare People Again
    [Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 9th] As over 550 million organized people who love peace around the world issue a powerful call against new war preparations, U.S. President Truman is again fantasizing about using the atomic bomb to scare people. On the 6th, he declared to the newly elected members of the 81st U.S. Congress that "for the peace and happiness of the world," he would order the use of the atomic bomb if necessary. It is not difficult for people to understand that the reason Truman is again brandishing the atomic bomb, this "magic weapon," is precisely because the North Atlantic Treaty Organization is deeply hated and unanimously opposed by the people of the world. The people are not only unwilling to be driven by war blocs, but are united and rising up to fight for democracy and lasting peace. Truman also wildly boasted about the "power" of the atomic bomb, but this not only cannot scare the people who are determined to fight for peace, but even those senior warmongers in the Washington headquarters of the war camp have long dared not believe it. Truman's clamoring only shows that he is working harder and harder but achieving less and less, and that he has run out of tricks.

　　在人民反战雄壮呼声下
    杜鲁门黔驴技穷
  　又幻想搬出原子弹吓唬人
    【新华社北平九日电】当全世界爱好和平的五亿五千万以上有组织的人民，发出反对新战争准备的雄壮呼声之际，美国总统杜鲁门又幻想搬出原子弹来吓唬人。六日他向美国第八十一届新任议员们声称：“为了世界的和平与幸福”，必要时将下令使用原子弹。人们不难了解，杜鲁门所以又祭起原子弹这件“万灵法宝”，正是因为北大西洋公约遭受全世界人民的深恶痛绝与齐声反对。人民不但不愿供战争集团驱使，而且团结一致，奋起争取民主与持久的和平。杜鲁门还狂吹了一顿原子弹的“威力”，但是这不但吓不住坚决争取和平的人民，就在战争阵营的华盛顿总部里，那些高级战争贩子们也早已不敢置信。杜鲁门的叫嚣，徒然显示其心劳日拙，黔驴技穷而已。
