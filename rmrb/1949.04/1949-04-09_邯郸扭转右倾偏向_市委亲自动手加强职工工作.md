　　Handan Reverses Rightist Deviation
  　Municipal Party Committee Personally Strengthens Work Among Employees

    [Report from this newspaper] The Handan Municipal Party Committee has begun to strengthen work among employees. This is a direct result of studying last month and initially clarifying the idea of relying on the working class to build the city. Thus far, the deviation of neglecting reliance on the working class in Handan City for the past three years has been initially corrected. According to the city, after its liberation in October 1945, it immediately began Party building work, but did not take root among the workers. According to statistics from last November, out of 745 Party members composed of workers, farmers, and handicraftsmen in the city, only 11 were of worker origin. After development in recent months, the number of Party members of worker origin has only reached 26. The city's work among employees also has a three-year history. After the wage increase campaign for shop employees following liberation, although the number of union members reached thousands, activities among employees in other departments were minimal, except for a few activities among shop employees. Between August and September 1947, work among employees was nearly suspended. After Party rectification in 1947, the proposal was made that the city needed to develop industry and commerce, and the Municipal Party Committee felt that it was not possible without organizing workers. It was not until April of last year that cadres were transferred to organize the Municipal Employees Preparatory Committee to begin rectifying work among employees. Between July and August of last year, the city discovered illegal exploitation of workers in private factories such as Da Xing. Because the Municipal Party Committee's thinking was unclear at the time, it did not dare to resolutely implement the policy of benefiting both labor and capital, and the matter was not resolved until October. After this, the Municipal Party Committee began to pay attention to work among employees, such as holding two sessions of workers' night schools last winter, organizing workers' consumer cooperatives, and making decisions on worker's work, while also instructing the Handan Daily to focus primarily on workers, etc. After studying last month, the Municipal Party Committee truly initially clarified in its thinking that the working class is the Party's fundamental class, and it is necessary to rely on the working class to unite other classes to build the city. Recalling the past deviation of neglecting reliance on the working class, it then further strengthened Party building and work among employees, increased the number of employee cadres, and Zhao Yuqing and Xue Jinglun from the Municipal Party Committee personally participated in leading work among employees, and the Employees' Association also formulated a work plan. However, because a thorough examination of the past deviations in policy implementation has not yet been carried out, and cadres have not received further education, many cadres still have confused ideas about relying on the working class. Some said: "One cannot see workers in Handan City." Some comrades in the trade and banking departments felt that what they were doing was not work among employees and felt it difficult to serve workers. And although the city's trade union has now reached more than two thousand members, the organization is very weak, and the municipal government has not yet properly resolved some issues among workers. It is heard that individual private factories (such as Yumin Printing Bureau) still have an illegal exploitation system of sixteen hours of work, and workers still lack cultural education. At present, the Municipal Party Committee, Employees' Association, Municipal Government, and enterprise departments urgently need to further conduct in-depth inspections, correct past deviations in policy implementation, earnestly study the Party's policies, and at the same time earnestly strengthen employee education in order to do a good job in work among employees.

### 邯郸扭转右倾偏向　市委亲自动手加强职工工作

　　邯郸扭转右倾偏向
  　市委亲自动手加强职工工作
    【本报讯】邯郸市委开始加强职工工作。这是经过上月学习，初步明确了依靠工人阶级建设城市的思想之直接结果。至此，邯市三年来忽视依靠工人阶级的偏向，已初步得到纠正。按该市于一九四五年十月解放后，即进行建党工作，但没有扎根在工人身上。据去年十一月统计，全市工人、农民、手工业者等成份党员七百四十五名，工人成份只有十一名，近几月来又经发展，工人成份党员才仅有二十六名。该市职工工作也有三年的历史，解放后经店员增资运动，工会会员虽数达千名，但除店员有少许活动外，其他部门职工活动则极少。一九四七年八、九月间，职工工作更陷于半停顿状态。一九四七年整党后，提出城市要发展工商业，市委觉得不组织工人不行，于去年四月才又抽调干部组织了市职工筹委会，开始整顿职工工作。去年七、八月间，该市曾发现私营大兴等工厂非法剥削工人，因当时市委思想不明确，对劳资两利政策不敢坚决贯彻，事件拖到十月才解决。此后市委对职工工作开始注意，如去冬举办了两期工人夜校，组织了工人消费合作社，并对工人工作作出决定，同时指示邯郸日报应以工人为主要对象等。市委于上月学习后，思想上真正初步明确了工人阶级是党的基本阶级，必须依靠工人阶级团结其他阶层来建设城市，回忆了过去忽视依靠工人阶级的偏向，遂即更进一步加强职工中党的建设和职工工作，增加了职工干部，市委赵玉清、薛经纶亲自参加领导职工工作，职工会并制订了工作计划。但因对过去执行政策的偏向还没有进行彻底检查，对干部还没有进行进一步的教育以致不少干部对依靠工人阶级尚存在糊涂观念。有的说：“在邯郸市上看不到工人。”贸易、银行部门有的同志认为自己作的不是职工工作，感到为工人服务困难。而该市工会至今会员虽达二千余名，组织却很薄弱，市政府则对工人中的一些问题尚未好好解决，据闻个别私营工厂（如裕民印刷局）尚存有十六小时工作的非法剥削制度，工人尚缺乏文化教育。目前该市市委、职工会、市政府及企业部门急需进一步深入检查，纠正过去执行政策的偏向，认真学习党的政策，同时要认真加强职工教育，才能把职工工作做好。
