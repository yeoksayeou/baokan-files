Xinhua News Agency, Northern Jiangsu, 17th: "Only let grain wait for the troops, not the troops wait for grain!" This is the slogan of the people of Jiangsu and Anhui to prepare sufficient food and grass for the southward army. Villages in the riverfront areas of northern Jiangsu are bustling with activity, concentrating the grain that was previously dispersed and stored due to intense struggles at transfer stations. Men and women have formed grain transport teams, using boats, livestock, vehicles, and carrying poles for transportation. For example, in (Gao)dong County, the sound of gongs summoning grain transportation can be heard everywhere. At night, lights illuminate the roads, and carts and carrying poles move back and forth continuously. Children follow the grain transport teams, beating gongs and drums, singing "Picking and packing, supporting the army to cross the Yangtze River," eliciting laughter from the ranks. In Glorious Township of the county, 2,345 laborers were mobilized in two days to concentrate all 150,000 catties of grain at the station. In Pinbei Township, 101 women participated in grain transportation, and two members of the township women's association carried more than 60 catties of grain several times. A martyr's family member and her daughter-in-law, one pushing and one pulling, transported 200 catties of grain. They said, "Good men were killed by the reactionaries. This time, transporting grain to the People's Liberation Army is also avenging the men!" The farmers are busy clearing the dikes and other obstacles such as stones and branches that were built in the rivers in the past to prevent the enemy from seizing grain, so that grain transport ships can pass smoothly. In Rudong County, a township farmers' association director led 23 cadres and many farmers to take turns going into the water. One group would replace the other when they were frozen. From early morning to dusk, they removed hundreds of large stones, allowing grain ships carrying 200 dan to pass. The Yanfu District formed a large-scale shipping group to transfer large quantities of grain in a planned manner. Workers have been more active in grain transportation. More than 200 young people in Bengbu voluntarily participated in grain transportation, dispatching 120 flatbed carts at a time. The rice and flour mills in various cities are as busy as grain transportation, generally milling rice and grinding flour for the People's Liberation Army. Workers in ten rice mills in Luhe City work more than ten hours a day. If they find the rice quality is slightly rough, they will process and grind it again. They say: This is for our troops, it must not be rough! There is a sound of milling flour and rice everywhere in the vast countryside. A village even decided at a villagers' meeting that men would transport grain and women would grind flour. Many rice bags were sewn for the People's Liberation Army. Women in Yeting (Yancheng) City alone made 14,580 bags in one day and night.

　　支援大军渡长江
  　女推磨男运粮
  　苏皖人民准备粮草
    【新华社苏北十七日电】“只能粮等部队，不让部队等粮”这是苏皖人民为南下大军准备充足粮草的口号。苏北沿江地区的乡村都忙碌起来，把过去因斗争紧张而分散保管的粮食集中到转运站。男的女的纷纷组成运粮小组，船只、牲口、车辆、担子都被用以转运。如（皋）东县到处可闻召集运粮食的锣声，晚上沿路灯火，车子担子来往不绝。儿童们跟随着运粮队敲锣打鼓，唱着“挑的挑来装的装，支援大军过长江，”引得行列里哈哈大笑。该县光荣乡在两天内出动了二千三百四十五个民工，把十五万斤粮食全部集中到站。拼北乡有一百零一个妇女参加运粮，乡妇女会两个委员都挑着六十几斤粮运了几趟。一个烈士家属和她的媳妇一推一拉，运着二百斤粮食，她们说：“好男人被反动派杀死了，这次运粮给解放军也是给男人报仇呀！”农民们正忙着给各大小河流清除过去为阻挡敌人抢粮而在河里筑的堤坝和其他石头、树枝等障碍，以便运粮船顺利通过。如东县一个乡农会主任率领二十三个干部和许多农民轮番下水，这一组冻疆了就让那一组来替换，从清早到傍晚总共起出几百块大石头，使载重二百担的粮船可以通过。盐阜区组成了大规模船运团，有计划地转运大批粮食。工人们在运粮中表现得更为积极。蚌埠二百多个青年自动参加运粮，一次就出动了一百二十辆平车。各城市的米厂磨场也和运粮一样紧张起来，普遍为解放军碾米磨面。六合城十家米厂的工人每天工作十小时以上，一发现米质稍为粗糙就加工再碾，他们说：这是给咱们队伍吃的，决不能粗糙！广大农村到处都是一片磨面碾米声。某村还在村民大会上决定男运粮，女推磨。各地给解放军缝制了许多米袋，仅叶挺（盐城）市妇女一昼夜中就做了一万四千五百八十条。
