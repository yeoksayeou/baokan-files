  　Complete Takeover of Northwest Cement Plant
    Municipal Party Committee Transports Large Quantities of Grain, Oil, and Salt, Prices Fall
    [Taiyuan Special Dispatch] The famous Northwest Cement Plant has been taken over by personnel sent by the Taiyuan Military Control Commission. The workers are now actively cleaning and tidying up the machinery, preparing to resume production. The plant is located in Ximing Village, 12 kilometers west of the city, covering an area of approximately 138 mu. It has complete power distribution, physical and chemical testing, and water supply equipment. With a daily output of 200 tons of cement, it is one of China's famous cement plants, along with Qixin in North China, Liaoning in Northeast China, Xicun in South China, and Huaxin. Moreover, because the plant site is located in the resource-rich Xishan area of Taiyuan, the raw materials needed to manufacture cement are all nearby: gypsum reserves reach 300 million tons, white flintstone is at least 100 tons or more, and kantu and soft sandstone are inexhaustible, so the prospects for development are extremely great. On the 20th of this month, the People's Liberation Army, penetrating deep, approached the plant. Yan's bandits fled in panic without being able to destroy it. All the factory workers remained at their original posts and did not move. Representatives of the Military Control Commission immediately entered the factory to take over, and on the 22nd, a workers' congress was held. On the one hand, policies were announced, ordering the original enterprise staff to handle the handover, and on the other hand, 30,000 jin of millet and hundreds of jin of oil and salt were transported in. The workers were overjoyed. They said, "We haven't had oil and salt for more than half a year. As soon as the People's Liberation Army arrived, the oil and salt also came." Each person was pre-borrowed seven days' worth of wages, with half a jin each of rice, salt, and oil. People have also been sent to buy vegetables for the workers. The staff and workers feel extremely happy about the Communist Party and the democratic government's great love for the workers. Preparations for resuming work have already begun.
    [Taiyuan Special Dispatch] The Taiyuan Municipal Trading Company has been transporting large quantities of grain, oil, and salt into the urban area for several days, and officially began selling them on the 28th. The People's Government is deeply concerned about the famine situation faced by the people of Taiyuan caused by Yan's bandits. On the evening of the liberation of Taiyuan, the first batch of grain was transported in. As of the 27th, more than 450,000 jin of millet, more than 76,000 jin of corn, more than 40,000 jin of white flour, and more than 100,000 jin of salt have been transported in. The above commodity prices have fallen by 75% compared to before liberation. For example, millet used to cost 112 yuan (People's currency - the same below) per jin, but now it only costs 28 yuan. In the future, large quantities of grain, oil, and salt will continue to arrive.

    【太原专电】太原市贸易公司连日将大批粮食油盐运入市区，并于二十八日正式开始出售。人民政府对阎匪所造成太原市人民的饥饿情况深切关怀。太原市解放的当天晚上，首批粮食，即行运到，截至二十七日止，已运到小米四十五万余斤，玉米七万六千余斤，白面四万余斤，盐十万余斤。上项物价已较未解放前下跌百分之七十五，如小米以前需一百一十二元（人民券——下同）一斤，现只要二十八元了。今后仍有大批粮食油盐陆续运到。
