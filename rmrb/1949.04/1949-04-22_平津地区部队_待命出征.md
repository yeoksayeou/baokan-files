　　Troops in the Beijing-Tianjin Area
　　Stand Ready to March
    The People's Liberation Army in the Beijing-Tianjin area, upon hearing the order from Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, were extremely excited and unanimously pledged to resolutely complete the glorious task given by the Party, ready to go south at any time to participate in the great Chinese People's Liberation War. When the headquarters of the Beiping Garrison Headquarters heard this news, it immediately conveyed it to its subordinate units and held a meeting of heroes; the soldiers immediately wrote wall newspapers and blackboard newspapers to express their determination. Special-class hero Wang Ru said, "We have been waiting impatiently for a long time. Since the Nanjing Kuomintang government has rejected the domestic peace agreement, we will respond to it by resolutely executing the orders of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu!" Hero Zhao Bingxi stated: As soon as the order comes, we will immediately go to the front. Sun Yunfu, a hero of a certain unit of the Northeast Field Army, said straightforwardly, "Great! This is simply it!" The large Liu Zhicheng waved his gleaming bayonet, his face flushed with excitement, and cheered, "Let the higher-ups give us orders. Now it's the right time!" The soldiers unanimously stated: On the first day the Nanjing Kuomintang government sent representatives to Beiping for negotiations, the Kuomintang reactionaries massacred students in Nanjing who were demanding genuine peace; now they have openly rejected the domestic peace agreement, which has completely exposed the tricks they are playing.

　　平津地区部队
  　待命出征
    平津地区的人民解放军，听到毛主席、朱总司令下了命令，情绪非常激昂，一致保证坚决完成党所给予的光荣任务，准备随时南下，参加伟大的中国人民解放战争。北平纠察总队司令部听到这一消息时，立即向所属部队作了传达，并举行功臣座谈会；战士们立即编写墙报、黑板报，表示决心。特等功臣王儒说：“我们早就等得不耐烦了，南京国民党政府既然拒绝国内和平协定，我们就用坚决执行毛主席、朱总司令的命令来回答它！”功臣赵柄喜表示：只要命令一来，我们立刻开赴前线。东北野战军某部功臣孙云甫爽朗地说：“好啦！这就干脆啦！”大个子刘志成幌着雪亮的刺刀，涨红着脸欢呼着：“上级给咱们下命令吧，现在可对劲啦！”战士们一致表示：南京国民党政府派代表来北平谈判的第一天，国民党反动派就在南京屠杀要求真正和平的学生；现在又公然拒绝国内和平协定，已经完全暴露了他们玩的是什么鬼把戏。
