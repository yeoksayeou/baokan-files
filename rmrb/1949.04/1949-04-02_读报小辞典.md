　　The All-Union Leninist Young Communist League (Komsomol) — The All-Union Leninist Young Communist League was founded on October 29, 1918. After Lenin's death in 1924, it was renamed the All-Union Leninist Young Communist League in memory of Lenin. At the time of its establishment, it had 22,000 members. By the end of last year (1948), the number of members had increased to more than 8 million. Among them, the majority are young people engaged in industrial production, young people in collective farms, young students, and young staff members, as well as engineers, technicians, teachers, doctors, and agronomists. Since its establishment, the Youth League, under the guidance of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), has participated in battles on various fronts. During the civil war, the anti-imperialist and anti-White bandit armed struggle, the Youth League mobilized three times to participate in the battle and won the Red Banner of Combat Medal. During the economic recovery period of 1921-24 and the period of the two Five-Year Plans, the Youth League members initiated the "Shock Brigade" movement and the "Stakhanov" movement, creating amazing production achievements. During the Patriotic War of Self-Defense, 7,000 combat heroes emerged. The underground organizations of the Youth League and the "Young Guards" established in the occupied areas of the enemy showed unparalleled patriotism and heroic spirit. Since the implementation of the post-war new Five-Year Plan, the Youth League members have become the most active members in various industrial and agricultural production departments, and the leaders of the "reducing costs" and "creating excess profits" movement.
