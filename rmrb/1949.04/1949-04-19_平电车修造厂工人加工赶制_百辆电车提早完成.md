　　Workers at the Ping Electric Tram Repair and Manufacturing Plant Speed Up Production
  　100 Trolley Cars Completed Ahead of Schedule
    [Report from this Newspaper] The “Welcome May First, Produce 100 Trolley Cars” campaign initiated by workers at the Beiping Electric Tram Company Repair and Manufacturing Plant has been completed ahead of schedule. The number of trolley cars operating on various lines has increased to eighty per day, and there are still twenty-five good cars in the factory, ready to be deployed at any time. Among them, four new-style trolley cars have been newly painted and named "Beiping Liberation," "Production," "Labor," and "People," respectively, and are scheduled to begin operation on May 1st, Labor Day. After the liberation of Beiping, through preliminary mobilization and education, the workers of the Beiping Electric Tram Company realized that the Communist Party is the party of the working class, and the tram company belongs to the workers themselves. Therefore, in the process of rushing to repair vehicles, the workers in each team automatically processed, helped each other, and created many miracles, with no team failing to exceed the planned target. The benchwork team originally planned to make only six copper heads, which would be enough, but in the eight days from March 18th to 26th, they not only completed the planned number but also produced three more. In the past, the entire benchwork team of twenty workers could only make one copper head a week, but now Liu Mengxing and Fang Wenlong have completed two in a week. (Whether new methods were adopted, please supplement the report – Editor) The original team in the overhaul group has now been divided into two teams, and seventeen cars were overhauled in March, while in the past, a team of seventeen workers could only overhaul four cars a month. Wang Naiquan, the welding foreman, used to weld a large gear wheel in three days, but now it only takes him a day and a half to weld one. All the workers in the team automatically work overtime and have cancelled contracting work and do not want overtime pay. The workers in the electrical team automatically extend their working hours, do not go home for lunch, and continue to work after get off work in the evening. The ironworkers used to produce thirty pinion gears a month, but now they make sixty in twenty days. Luo Wenzhong and Peng Zhanbao, workers in the iron furnace room, received letters from home asking them to return home, but they said, "We'll go after May First, after completing the task." On March 11th, the factory inspection found that the electric cylinders of nineteen damaged cars were incomplete, with 70% of the parts missing. Repairing electric cylinders was originally the task of the jacking team, but the jacking team had to maintain the operation of eighty cars every day and was too busy. Therefore, it was decided to change the plan to be done by the electrical and benchwork teams. The benchwork team supplied materials, and the turning team matched the screws. Everyone worked together, and from March 12th to March 26th, the electric cylinders of the nineteen damaged cars were repaired. Before liberation, it took five or six days to repair an electric cylinder, but now it takes less than a day to repair one.

　　平电车修造厂工人加工赶制
  　百辆电车提早完成
    【本报讯】北平电车公司修造厂工人发起之迎接五一，出车百辆运动，已经提前完成计划。现每天在各线行驶之电车已增至八十辆，厂内尚存好车二十五辆，随时可以出动。其中新式电车四辆已油饰一新，并分别命名为“北平解放号”，“生产号”，“劳动号”，“人民号”，定“五一”劳动节起开出行驶。北平解放后，北平电车工人经过初步的发动与教育，认识到共产党是工人阶级的党，电车公司是工人们自己的了，所以在赶修车辆过程中，各班工人自动加工，互相帮助，创造了许多奇迹，没有一班不超过预定计划的。案工班原来计划做铜头六个就够用了，由三月十八日到二十六日的八天中，不仅完成了预计数目，且多赶造了三个。过去案工班全体二十个工人一星期只能做一个铜头，现在刘梦星、方文龙两个人在一星期内就完成了两个。（是否采用了新办法，希补充报导——编者）大修班原有的一班人，现在分成两班做工，三月份一个月大修了十七辆车，而过去一班十七个工人，一个月只能大修四部车。焊工领班王乃全以前三天焊一个大牙轮，现在焊一个只用一天半。全班工人都自动加班，并且取消包工，不要加班费。电工班工人自动延长工作时间，中午不回去吃饭，晚间下了班还继续工作。铁工班以前一个月出三十个少牙轮，现在二十天做了六十个。铁炉房的工人罗文忠、彭占宝接到家信，让他们回家，他们说：“过了五一，完成任务再说”。三月十一日，厂方检查发现十九辆坏车的电缸残缺不全，短少零件百分之七十；修电缸原是架车班的任务，但架车班每天要维持八十辆车的行驶，忙不过来；于是改由电工、案工计划去做。案工班供给材料，旋工班配螺丝，大家通力合作，从三月十二日起，到三月二十六日，把十九辆坏车的电缸都修好了。解放前修一个电缸要五、六天，现在修好一个还不要一天的时间。　　　　　　（仲）
