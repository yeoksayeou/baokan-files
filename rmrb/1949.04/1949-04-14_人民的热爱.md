　　The People's Love
    Mei Lei
    When the southward marching troops of the Liberation Army's × unit approached Li Village, the sound of a loudspeaker faintly carried from the village: "Our troops are here! Whoever wants to send boiled water, please bring it to the front of the theater stage..."

    Once the troops entered the village, they saw old uncles, old aunties, little sisters, and sisters-in-law all carrying kettles, holding basins, and taking tea cups and bowls, coming from all directions, east, west, north, and south, talking and laughing. As soon as the troops entered the square in front of the theater stage, all kinds of kettles, basins, and bowls from men, women, old and young, were piled up. Little brothers and sisters came up to hold the soldiers' hands, asking about their well-being...

    "Comrades, you've worked hard!" "Drink it while it's hot!" Old uncles and aunties... also came up with soup and tea. Indeed, there wasn't much plain boiled water, mostly steaming jujube soup and fragrant tea. ...The masses were as sincere as family members, and the soldiers didn't decline. Because everyone was so thirsty, they all wanted to find something cooler to drink, but couldn't find any. An old auntie said with a smile, "My good children! Drink it hot, drinking it hot won't make you sick..." A little sister pointed to the basin she had just put down and said, "Drink my jujube soup! It's good for your health!..." Everyone was vying to have the soldiers drink their own soup and tea... In this deep love of the people's big family, the soldiers were at a loss.

    Several comrades took out cold cornbread buns and ate them. Two little girls saw this and whispered a few words to an old auntie. The old auntie hurriedly came over, speaking in a tone of complaining about children, "Hey! Why are you eating cold ones! Quickly let me heat them up for you, eat them hot." The auntie said, going to snatch the cornbread buns from the soldiers' hands. The soldiers repeatedly declined, "Auntie, it's okay, we are all young people with strong internal heat, and besides, the troops are about to depart." The auntie couldn't win the argument, and still worriedly muttered, "Eating cold things, you'll get sick...."

    When the troops were preparing to leave, Captain Lu gave the firewood coupons to the village cadres. When the masses saw this, they stirred up a commotion. An old uncle ran over and said earnestly, "Comrades! Everyone's opinion is not to accept the comrades' firewood coupons. A little bit of boiled water is not worth it." The troops can't use the people's things for free, the troops insisted on obeying discipline.

    The troops realigned and thanked the masses. In the magnificent singing of "Follow Chairman Mao," the people's fathers, mothers, brothers, and sisters cheered and sent off their own soldiers.

　　人民的热爱
    梅蕾
    当解放军×部南征的队伍走近李家庄的时候，村里隐隐地传出来广播筒的喊声：“咱的队伍来了，谁愿意送开水，可送到戏台前……”
    一回，队伍走进村，看见老大叔、老大娘、小妹妹和大嫂子们都提着壶，端着盆，拿着茶杯、茶碗，说着笑着自东西南北涌来了，队伍刚走进戏台前广场，男女老少各色壶、盆、碗都堆满了，小弟弟、妹妹们就上来拉着战士的手，问长短……。
    “同志都辛苦啦！”“趁热快喝吧！”老大叔、大娘们……也都端着汤、茶偎上来了。确实，没什么开水，多半是热气腾腾的枣汤香片叶子茶。……群众们诚如家人，战士们也就不推辞了。因为大家太渴了的缘故，都要找比较凉些的喝，可是找不着呀，一位老大娘笑着说：“我的好孩子呀！喝热的，喝热的不害病呵……”一位小妹妹指着她刚才放下的盆说：“喝我的枣汤吧！喝了对身体有好处呀！……”大家都争着叫战士喝自己汤、茶……在这人民大家庭的挚爱里，战士都不知所措了。
    在几位同志，取出了凉棒子面窝窝头吃了，被两个小姑娘瞧见啦，跑到一位老大娘跟前咕哝了两句，那位老大娘慌忙地过来，带着抱怨孩子的口吻，说：“哎！你为啥要吃冷的呀！快给我去给你们烧烧，热了吃吧。”大娘说着就去夺战士手里的窝窝头，战士再三推辞：“大娘，没关系呀，俺们都是年青人火气大，再说队伍就要出发了”。大娘争执不过，还担心地嘴里嘟噜着：“吃冷的，得病……。”
    队伍准备走的时候，吕队长把柴票给了村干部，群众看见哄了起来，一位老大叔跑来郑重的说：“同志！大家的意见是不收同志们的柴票，一些开水，不值得。”队伍不能白用群众的东西呵，队伍坚持要遵守纪律。
    队伍又整队，向群众致谢，在“跟着毛泽东走”的雄壮歌声里，人民的父、母、兄、妹欢呼着、送着自己的子弟兵。
