　　【Beiping News】In addition to the sixteen newspapers, magazines, and news agencies that were approved for registration by the Military Control Commission some days ago, another second batch of fourteen in this city have been approved by the Municipal People's Government News Office and the Military Control Commission, and will be issued temporary registration certificates. They include: (1) Three daily newspapers: "People's Evening News," "Daily English Telegraph," "Movie News Daily"; (2) One five-day publication: "People's Railway News"; (3) Two weekly publications: "Literary Gazette," "Beiping English Digest"; (4) One ten-day publication: "North China Pictorial"; (5) One semi-monthly publication: "Comrade-in-Arms"; (6) Four monthly publications: "Banking Monthly," "North China Literature and Art," "Literary Labor," "Progressive Youth"; (7) One quarterly publication: "Journal of the Chinese Chemical Society"; (8) One irregular publication: "Military and Political Communications." Furthermore, the "Drama World Pictorial" and "Drama World Daily," which applied for registration, were purely pornographic publications before liberation, engaging in unprincipled flattery or attacks on actors. After liberation, there has been no thorough change in content and style, resulting in numerous letters of complaint from all sides. In accordance with Article 4 of the "Provisional Measures for the Registration of Newspapers, Magazines, and News Agencies in Beiping," the Military Control Commission has ordered them to suspend publication first, pending review and handling.

　　平市第二批报刊十四家
  　领得临时登记证
    戏世界画刊、戏世界日刊停刊
    【平市讯】本市申请登记的报纸、杂志、通讯社，除日前由军管会批准登记的十六家外，现又有第二批十四家经市人民政府新闻处呈奉军管会批准，允予发给临时登记证。计有：（一）日刊三种：人民晚报、每日英文电讯、影戏日报；（二）五日刊一种：人民铁道报；（三）周刊二种：文艺报、北平英文文摘；（四）旬刊一种：华北画刊；（五）半月刊一种：战友；（六）月刊四种：银行月刊、华北文艺、文艺劳动、进步青年；（七）季刊一种：中国化学会会志；（八）不定期刊一种：军政通讯。又，申请登记的“戏世界画刊”与“戏世界日刊”，在解放前为纯黄色性刊物，对剧人进行无原则吹捧或攻击。解放后在内容及作风上仍未有彻底改变，致引起各方纷纷投书控诉。军管会根据“北平市报纸杂志通讯社登记暂行办法”第四条规定，已令其先行停刊，听候审查处理。
