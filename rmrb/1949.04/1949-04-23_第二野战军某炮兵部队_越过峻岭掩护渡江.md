Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains Front, 22nd – A certain artillery unit of the Second Field Army, tasked with covering the crossing of the Yangtze River, safely traversed a steep mountain, previously considered impassable for artillery, reaching a height of 5,700 meters, in the Dabie Mountains. When they arrived at their bivouac site singing songs, the local people exclaimed in amazement: "How were you able to cross this mountain? In the past, the Kuomintang artillery lost many animals, which fell and died, trying to cross it." Inspired by the great task of crossing the Yangtze River, the artillerymen, with their determination and courage, carefully and intently traversed the precipitous mountains. They often unloaded the cannons and carried them themselves across mountain paths that were impassable for the animals. When one horse lost its footing and fell into a ditch, two platoon leaders and five soldiers jumped into the chest-deep water without hesitation and pulled the horse out. To allow the animals to rest and catch their breath, Deputy Company Commander Cheng Xiangrui carried a cannon carriage weighing 173 kilograms for more than half a kilometer. A horse handler, Run Liu, carried a cannon cradle weighing 197 kilograms over a mountain ridge three kilometers high. When one animal fell and could no longer walk, Battalion Commander Jia Wenxian carried a cannon weighing more than 50 kilograms up a mountain five kilometers high. Under his influence, officers and soldiers eagerly vied to carry the cannons. Deputy Company Commander Xing Yongfu, whose wounds had not yet healed, also carried artillery shells. These artillerymen finally crossed this steep mountain safely with unwavering determination.

　　第二野战军某炮兵部队
  　越过峻岭掩护渡江
    【新华社中原前线二十二日电】掩护渡江的第二野战军某炮兵部队，在大别山中安全通过了以往一般认为炮兵无法攀越的高达五千七百公尺的某峻岭。当他们唱着歌开抵宿营地时，驻地人民都惊奇地说：“你们怎么能过得这座山的呢？过去国民党炮队摔死了好多牲口也没过得来。”被打过长江去的伟大任务鼓舞着的炮兵们，都以他们的决心和智勇在悬崖峻岭上谨慎而紧张地行走着，他们常常把炮卸下来自己扛着走过牲口无法通过的山路。有一匹马一失足落到沟里了，两个排长和五个战士便毫不犹疑地跳进没胸水里，把马拉上来。为了让牲口喘气休息，副连长成祥瑞扛着一百七十三斤重的炮车走了一里多路。驭手—润流扛着一百九十七斤重的炮腰架爬过了三里高的山头。有匹牲口摔的不能走了，营长贾文先便扛着五十多斤重的炮爬上五里高的山头。在他的影响下，干部战士们都争先抢着扛炮。伤口未好的副连长邢永富也担着炮弹。这些炮手们终于以顽强坚毅的决心安全越过了这座峻岭。
