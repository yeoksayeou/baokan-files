　　The Entire Soviet People Commemorate Gorky's Birthday
   "His Brilliant Works Record the Birth of a New Socialist Era!"
    [Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 31st] This year, March 28th marked the 81st anniversary of the birth of the great Soviet writer Maxim Gorky. The entire Soviet people held extensive commemorations. The Pravda newspaper excerpted and published Gorky's famous work "Mother" and his famous political essay "The City of the Yellow Devil" written in 1906 about New York.
    Pravda published Xibierbina's commemorative essay. Xibierbina wrote: Gorky is the petrel in the storm of the socialist revolution, and his literary activities mark the entry of human art into a new era. His brilliant works record the birth of a new socialist era and enrich the treasure house of world culture. His voice resounds throughout the world, exerting a powerful influence on the minds and hearts of hundreds of millions of people. Xibierbina continued: With the true enthusiasm of a patriot, Gorky closely integrated his creative activities with the urgent tasks of the people's liberation movement. For example, his famous novel "Mother" expresses the ideas in Lenin's book "What Is To Be Done?". Gorky's best works were written under the personal influence of Lenin and Stalin. Thanks to their friendship and powerful help, he became the founder of Soviet literature. Under his guidance, Soviet writers turned to pay close attention to the issues of the people's destiny. Xibierbina pointed out that Gorky unyieldingly cultivated among the people a feeling of national self-esteem and a love for the motherland and its culture. He resolutely criticized the uncritical flattery and servility towards Western bourgeois culture. One of the main tasks of his literary activities was to fight against bourgeois deception. He exposed the enemies of progress and democracy hidden behind the facade of bourgeois democracy, and with perseverance and enthusiasm, he fought against imperialist ideology, war worship, racism, and other forms of spiritual banditry. Xibierbina concluded that Gorky's literary works, political essays, and social activities play a huge role in helping the best representatives of world intellectuals stand on the side of the fighting proletariat. He influenced many famous writers in the world and became a recognized leader in progressive cultural circles worldwide. Gorky's example shows how enormous the Soviet people's contribution to world culture is.

　　全苏人民纪念高尔基诞辰
   “他的光辉的作品记载了社会主义新时代的诞生！”
    【新华社北平三十一日电】今年三月二十八日是伟大的苏联作家高尔基诞辰八十一周年纪念，全苏人民都举行广泛的纪念。真理报摘录刊载了高尔基的名著“母亲”、和他在一九零六年所写的关于纽约的著名政治论文“黄色魔鬼的城”。
    真理报刊登了希贝尔比娜的纪念论文。希贝尔比娜写道：高尔基是社会主义革命暴风雨中的海燕，他的文学活动标志着人类艺术的发展进入了新时代。他的光辉的作品记叙了社会主义新时代的诞生，充实了世界文化的宝库。他的声音响彻全世界，对几万万人的脑筋和心灵发生了有力的影响。希贝尔比娜继称：高尔基以爱国者的真实热情，把他的创造活动和人民解放运动的迫切任务密切结合起来。例如他的著名的小说“母亲”，就表现了列宁所写的“做什么？”一书中的思想。高尔基的最好的作品都是在列宁和斯大林个人的影响之下写成的，由于他们的友谊和有力的帮助，他成为苏维埃文学的奠基者。在他的引导下，苏联作家都转而密切地注意人民命运的问题。希贝尔比娜指出：高尔基不屈不挠地在人民中间培育民族至尊的感情，热爱祖国和祖国文化的爱情。他坚决斥责对西方资产阶级文化的无批判的阿谀奉迎的态度，他的文学活动的主要任务之一，就是对资产阶级愚民主义作战。他揭露了隐藏在资产阶级民主面貌下的进步和民主的敌人，并以坚毅和热情，对帝国主义思想，对战争崇拜、种族主义以及其他形式的精神上的盗匪主义进行战斗。希贝尔比娜最后称：高尔基的文学作品、政治论文和社会活动起着极大的作用，帮助世界知识分子最优秀的代表站到战斗的无产阶级这一边来。他影响了世界许多著名的作家，成为公认的世界进步文化界的领袖。高尔基的例子说明苏联人民对世界文化的贡献是多么巨大。
