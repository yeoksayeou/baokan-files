　　Beiping People's Broadcasting Station
  　Holds Employee Broadcasting Forum
  　To Listen to Workers' Opinions!
    [Beiping City News] The Beiping People's Broadcasting Station held an employee broadcasting forum at the preparatory committee of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions at 9:00 AM yesterday (the 12th). In attendance were working comrades from the Propaganda and Education Department of the preparatory committee of the Federation of Trade Unions, and 24 representatives from 19 key state-owned enterprises and factories, including the Changxindian Railway Machinery Factory, Mentougou Coal Mine Bureau, 70th Ordnance Factory, Uniform General Factory, and Telecommunications Bureau. Everyone agreed that the content of the broadcast must be enriched to become a powerful tool for carrying out worker propaganda and education and for exchanging experiences. Ka Di, a representative from the Second Uniform Factory, said: "Among the more than 800 workers in our factory, more than 400 are illiterate. If we use radio broadcasting to educate the workers, the effect will be stronger than newspapers." Xu De, a representative from the Mentougou Trade Union, said: "The workers believe that the songs popular during the Kuomintang era should really no longer be broadcast in Beiping City. Our radio station should strengthen its work and change those decadent sounds."
    Regarding the distribution of radios, it was very uneven in the past: the 70th Ordnance Factory only had one, and the Eighth Repair Shop had none. The representatives earnestly requested that radios be distributed at low prices in a planned manner. The Changxindian Railway Machinery Factory has many radios, most of which are placed in staff dormitories. The Uniform Factory and the Telecommunications Bureau have their own amplifiers, and each workshop has loudspeakers, but they are now idle. Therefore, everyone also suggested organizing workers to listen in a planned way.
    In addition, several representatives hoped to make more use of old forms in the future. The representative from the Changxindian Railway Machinery Factory hopes to use the radio station for popular lectures. Everyone believed that the allocation of worker time should be arranged from 12:00 to 1:30 PM and from 6:00 to 9:00 PM in the evening.
    Regarding the establishment of broadcasting groups in each unit, it was finally decided that the existing communication groups in each factory would do it first. In addition to providing the radio station with broadcast communication drafts, the broadcasting groups should also organize various singing, drama and other performance programs. Representatives from eleven units volunteered and guaranteed that they could broadcast on the People's Broadcasting Station once every ten days.

### 北平人民广播电台　召开职工广播座谈会　倾听工人意见！

　　北平人民广播电台
  　召开职工广播座谈会
  　倾听工人意见！
    【平市讯】北平人民广播电台昨天（十二日）上午九点钟在本市职工总会筹委会召开职工广播座谈会，到会的有职工总会筹委会宣教部的工作同志，和长辛店铁路机厂、门头沟煤矿局、七十兵工厂、被服总厂、电讯局等重要公营企业工厂十九个单位代表二十四人。大家一致认为必需充实广播的内容，成为进行工人宣传教育与交流经验的有力工具。被服二厂代表卡笛说：“我们厂里八百多个工人当中，有四百多个不认识字，如果用广播电台来教育工人，效果比报纸还要强”。门头沟职工会代表许德说：“工人们都认为国民党时代流行的歌曲，实在不应该再让它在北平市上播送了。我们的电台应该加强工作，把那些靡靡之音改过来。”
    关于收音机的分布，过去很不平均：七十兵工厂只有一架，第八修械所一架也没有。代表们热切要求能以低价有计划地配售收音机。长辛店铁路机厂有许多收音机，大部份放在职员宿舍里。被服厂和电讯局自己有扩音器，每一个工作室都有喇叭，可是现在都闲放着。所以大家又提议有计划的去组织工人收听。
    此外，好几个代表希望以后能够多利用旧形式。长辛店铁路机厂代表希望用电台作通俗的讲课。职工时间的分配，大家认为应该安排在中午的十二点到一点半和晚上的六点到九点。
    关于各单位建立广播小组的问题，最后决定先由各工厂原有的通信小组来作。广播小组除供给电台以广播通讯稿外，还应该组织各种歌咏戏剧等表演节目。有十一个单位的代表自告奋勇，保证每隔十天可以到人民广播电台广播一次。
