　　North China People's Government Reissues Previous Order
    Martyrs' Families Should Postpone Moving Remains During Spring Ploughing
  　Military Dependents Should Postpone Visiting Troops
    [Our Newspaper] The North China People's Government recently issued a circular to governments at and above the county level, stating: "Recently, reports from Northeast China, Rehe, Beiping, and Tianjin indicate that 'although it is now the spring ploughing season, the transportation of martyrs' remains continues in various places, which not only affects production but also creates obstacles due to busy military transport, leading to resentment among the martyrs' families, even to the point of crying and causing a negative impact.'" This government issued a circular on March 8th, instructing all provinces and offices to postpone the moving of martyrs' remains. As the spring ploughing season is now upon us, and it is a busy time for agriculture, with military transport also heavily occupied, the continuous introduction of martyrs' families to move remains from various places is impractical. We hereby reissue the previous order: if any martyrs' families request to move remains, they must be persuaded with tact and no passports or official letters should be issued to avoid delays and impact on supporting the front and production. Furthermore, recently, there have been many military dependents visiting troops. Issues regarding transportation and travel expenses often cause many difficulties. To take care of spring ploughing, district and village governments should be instructed to explain this situation to military dependents, persuading them not to come and to use communication methods to contact their children.
　　Important Correction
    In the first mimeographed news release "Proclamation of the People's Liberation Army" issued by this agency to Beiping newspapers on April 25th, there are two errors: (1) In the second sentence of Article 3, "...all recognize their ownership" should be "...shall recognize their ownership." (2) In the first sentence of Article 7, "The feudal land ownership system among peasants is unreasonable" should be "The feudal land ownership system in rural areas is unreasonable."
    In addition to requesting Beiping newspaper readers to pay attention to this correction, all troop units, institutions, schools, and bookstores are requested to make the above corrections when printing this proclamation, based on the April 25th Beiping newspapers or the mimeographed draft of this agency.

### 华北人民政府再申前令  春耕期中烈属暂勿起灵  军属暂勿到部队去省亲

　　华北人民政府再申前令
    春耕期中烈属暂勿起灵
  　军属暂勿到部队去省亲
    【本报讯】华北人民政府顷向县以上各级政府发出通令称：近据东北、热河、北平、天津各地反映：“今虽时值春耕，但各地仍不断有起运烈士灵柩者，不独影响生产，且现在军运繁忙，起灵烈属往往因乘车问题发生障碍而表愤懑，甚或痛哭流涕，影响不佳。”等情；查本府三月八日曾通令各省、署暂缓让烈属起灵，际此春耕季节，正值农忙，且军运繁忙，各地仍不断介绍烈属前往起灵，实际不容易办到。兹特再申前令，如遇烈属要求起灵者，务必婉言劝阻，不得再开护照或公函，以免往返误事影响支前与生产。再者，最近军属到部队省亲者仍甚多，因乘车与路费问题亦常常发生许多困难，为照顾春耕，应转饬区村政府向军属多多解释，劝其勿来，可用通信办法与子弟联系。
　　重  要  更  正
    四月二十五日本社发给北平各报的第一次油印新闻稿“人民解放军布告”一稿中，有两处错误：（一）第三条第二句“……均承认其所有权”，应为“……当承认其所有权”。（二）第七条第一句“农民中的封建的土地所有权制度是不合理的”，应为“农村中的封建的土地所有权制度是不合理的”。
    除请北平各报读者注意此项更正外，并请各部队机关学校书店在印行这个布告时，凡以二十五日北平各报或本社油印稿为根据者，务必作如上的更正。
