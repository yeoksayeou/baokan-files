　　Drought Resistance and Disaster Prevention
    The Grain Rain period has passed, which is the season for farmers to sow seeds, but there has been no thorough rainfall yet. Therefore, leading and organizing the masses to utilize water resources for sowing is our current important task. The North China People's Government has issued an urgent notice on drought resistance and disaster prevention, and all regions must overcome all difficulties and vigorously organize and implement this urgent central task.
    Although the North China region is prone to drought, it has stubbornly overcome nature in the past under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government. Experience has proven that as long as we have planned and led organization of the masses, all difficulties can be solved. Chahar Province had to replant seeds for four consecutive years due to drought, but this did not cause farmers to miss the farming season. This year, significant achievements have been made in farmland water conservancy construction, increasing production, and drought resistance. For example, in Huixian County, Taihang, the construction of a 10,000-zhang (Chinese unit of length) canal can irrigate 12,000 mu (Chinese unit of area) of land. In Ningnan County, Jinnan, the construction of a sluice gate and canal on the North Feng River has already irrigated 30,000 mu of land. In Qingyuan, Jizhong, six villages dug 22 earth wells and 6 cone wells in six or seven days, which can supply water for carrying and sowing on 600 mu of land. All of these can serve as models for drought resistance, disaster prevention, and utilizing water resources for sowing in various regions.
    Cadres in various regions should deeply mobilize and persuade the masses on this work, break the superstitious idea of relying on the heavens for food, and wage a firm struggle against nature.

　　抗旱防灾
    谷雨已过，正是农民播种时节，但至今尚未落透雨。因之领导组织群众发挥水力进行播种，则是我们当前的重要任务，华北人民政府已发出了抗旱防灾的紧急通知，各地必须排除一切困难把这一紧急的中心任务大力组织实现。
    华北区虽然多旱，但在共产党及人民政府领导下过去曾顽强的战胜了自然。经验证明，只要我们有计划的有领导的组织群众，一切困难即可迎刃而解。察哈尔省因天旱曾连续四年点种，而没使农民误过节季。今年兴修农田水利，增产抗旱已获得了很大的成绩，如太行辉县兴修大渠万丈可浇地一万二千亩，冀南宁南县在北沣河修闸开渠现已浇地三万亩，冀中清苑六个村在六七天内挖土井二十二眼，锥井六眼，可供挑水播种六百亩，这一切都可作为各地抗旱防灾发挥水力播种的借镜。
    各地干部对此工作应当深入动员与说服群众，打破靠天吃饭的迷信思想，与自然作坚强的斗争。
