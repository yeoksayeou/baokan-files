Shijiazhuang North China Iron Factory Clearly Distinguishes Rewards and Punishments
Completes One Hundred High-Pressure Sterilizers Ahead of Schedule
[Shijiazhuang News] After initial improvements in leadership, the Shijiazhuang North China Iron Factory has achieved the success of completing one hundred large and small high-pressure sterilizers ahead of schedule. The factory originally planned that fifty large high-pressure sterilizers would require 1,550 workdays; fifty small high-pressure sterilizers would require 350 workdays; and the repair and inspection of the large and small high-pressure sterilizers would require 100 workdays, for a total of 2,000 workdays to complete. Under the enthusiastic competition of the thirty workers (of whom only nine were skilled workers) who participated in this labor, production efficiency was greatly improved. Each large high-pressure sterilizer only required 18 workdays, and each small high-pressure sterilizer only required 4 workdays. With the addition of 50 workdays for repair and inspection, a total of 1,150 workdays were used, and all were completed. Eight hundred and fifty workdays were saved, and 250 catties of coal were conserved. The achievement of these results is mainly due to the improved leadership after the initial rectification of discipline in the factory. In the past, the leadership problems of the factory were manifested in the fact that it rarely gave appropriate praise and rewards to active workers, and it did not assist in improving the loose organization of workers. After the year-end appraisal and salary adjustment, the factory focused on employee education. Under the leadership of the trade union, it gave everyone political and technical lessons, established a workers' club, and the blackboard newspaper frequently reflected everyone's strengths and weaknesses, and held meetings to discuss and conduct struggles against undesirable tendencies. Workers who were not active in the past but became active were also rewarded. In the salary adjustment, fair treatment was also given according to their skills. These clear-cut rewards and punishments increased the enthusiasm of the workers for production. Previously, one sterilizer lid was made per day, but this was improved to two and a half per day, and even three were strived for. The convening of the city's workers' representative conference further encouraged the enthusiasm of the factory's workers, so the task of completing one hundred sterilizers was completed ahead of schedule.

　　石市华北铁厂赏罚分明
  　提前完成百个高压消毒器
    【石家庄讯】经过初步改善领导，石市华北铁工厂，已获得提前完成一百个大、小高压消毒器的成绩。该厂原计划五十个大高压消毒器，须一千五百五十个工；五十个小高压消毒器，须三百五十个工；大小高压消毒器修检须用一百个工，总共两千个工才能完成。在参加这次劳动的三十个工人（其中仅九个熟练工人）的热情竞赛下，生产效率大大提高，大高压消毒器，每个只用工十八个，小高压消毒器，每个用工四个，再加修检工五十个，共用了一千一百五十个工，已全部完成。少用了八百五十个工，且节省了二百五十斤煤。这些成绩的获得，主要是该厂在初步整顿纪律以后，改善领导的结果。该厂过去领导上的毛病表现在对积极工人很少予以适当表扬奖励，工人组织散漫亦未予以协助改进。该厂在年终评奖，调整工资以后，抓紧了职工教育，在工会领导下，给大家上政治课技术课，建立了工人俱乐部，黑板报经常反映大家的优缺点，并开会讨论，进行反不良倾向的斗争，对于过去工作不积极而变为积极的工人同样给以奖励。在调整工资上，也按其技术给以公正的待遇，这些赏罚分明的作法，提高了工人生产的积极性。以前一天作一个消毒盖的提高到一天作两个半，甚至争取作三个。全市职工代表大会的召开，更鼓励了该厂工人的热情，因此提前完成了一百个消毒器的任务。
