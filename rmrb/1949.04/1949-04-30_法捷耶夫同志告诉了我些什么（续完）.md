　　What Comrade Fadeyev Told Me
　　(Conclusion)
　　Ding Ling

　　Sophronov continued to tell his personal story. In 1930, he wrote "The First Cavalry Army" (about the story of Bukharin). After Gorky read it, he immediately wrote him a letter, which he still keeps. He also personally promoted four writers, and he enthusiastically spoke of Stalin. Comrade Stalin almost read every work and remembered them. This spring, he talked with the writers for four hours. At that time, international issues were very tense, but he still came to talk about each work, and he knew everyone. Some works even the writers had forgotten, but he still remembered. He also made a summary, saying that they pointed out right and wrong in a very friendly manner, and he valued literature most. So I also told them that our Chairman Mao was also like that. He read the supplements of the Party newspaper every day, he remembered our works, he personally led us in meetings, and solved major problems for us. His speech at the Forum on Literature and Art could become a world-famous saying.

　　Comrade Sophronov showed great interest in the stories I told about Chairman Mao. I didn't feel that time passed quickly at all. Lyuba reminded me that I should talk about publishing. I had to look at my watch again, it was already half past five. So, I busily introduced the books I brought one by one, such as "Li Youcai Tells Tales," "Glory Belongs to the Heroes," "The Invincible Three Warriors," "The Hurricane," "The White-Haired Girl," and "Blood and Tears of Hatred," more than a dozen books in total. Several people gathered around to look at them. They promised me that they would find someone to translate them, criticize them after translation, and tell us their opinions. I also introduced Gu Yuan and Yan Han's woodcuts to them. There was a catalog, explanation, and author's biography in it, so they also promised me to forward the same copy to the art magazine and try to publish it. Whether they can do it, I don't know, but I extremely believe them, although there are so many difficult ancient Chinese characters, they must have a way to overcome them.

　　The publishing in the Soviet Union is amazing. There is a national general publishing bureau, and also various departments' publishing houses, such as for youth, children, workers, and women. The publishing office of the Writers' Association has more than two hundred staff members, including management personnel and newspaper and magazine staff. They published eight million books (one hundred and twenty kinds) this year, costing three thousand tons of paper. The royalties are so high that Chinese literary workers are afraid to hear them. One page (sixteen pages) costs 1,500 to 4,000 rubles. The average worker's salary is 500 to 600 rubles per month, and the lowest wage is 300 rubles (the wages of Stakhanovites are very high). Because each book sells a lot, the royalties are even higher. The value of intellectual labor is generally highly valued in the Soviet Union.

　　Sophronov and Visnevsky are both playwrights, and the other two young writers are also involved in drama. They are very concerned about my relationship with drama, and especially interested in knowing that I led the Northwest Battlefield Service Corps. But no matter what, the time had reached six o'clock, it was time to say goodbye. I especially apologized to Visnevsky, because there was no chance for us to exchange opinions, he always listened very carefully, but rarely spoke. The publishing issue was not discussed in detail either. The publisher with the particularly shiny hair promised to write a report, including the charter, plan, and situation. He said with a smile, "Everything will be there."

　　When putting on my coat downstairs, Comrade Ye told me that this house was the house of Natasha, the heroine in the novel "War and Peace." I complained to him again: "Oh, why didn't you tell me earlier?" He smiled, but asked: "What is your impression of the conversation?" I didn't answer, but asked him what he thought of the problems I talked about. He said: "Very important and very meaningful."

　　On the way back, Comrade Ye became a talkative person. He was also sitting next to the driver in the front, turning his whole body to the back, sometimes saying a few words in Chinese, and when there was no way, he said Russian, sometimes calling me Mr. Ding, sometimes calling me Comrade Ding, and sometimes calling me Ding Ling directly. What I remember most is that he said: "You must find a way to come again, you must come again, and she (referring to Lyuba) and I will help you as much as possible, I will definitely help you." His enthusiasm influenced the very young secretary who always followed him. She was originally very quiet, but now she seemed like my little sister. Lyuba worked even harder. The air in the car really became so lovely, but suddenly we arrived at the hotel door. Comrade Ye sent me out and told me to try to come again when he said goodbye. He made me feel a little reluctant to part with him.

　　When Lyuba and I sat at the dining table, my hands were shaking when I picked up the spoon. I realized that I only ate two slices of bread in the morning. Although the Writers' Association was full of snacks and candies, and they were kindly offering them to me, I felt very full at that time, too full of joy and excitement, I didn't eat anything at all, and now I felt very empty in my stomach. I thought of this and laughed even more. Lyuba asked me what I was laughing at, and I said: "We prepared so many speeches in the house, and not a single sentence was used, it's a pity for your beautifully modified words! Ha……" Lyuba answered seriously: "I think it's better to say it this way than to prepare it." I said: "Really?" He agreed it was true, and added that you must remember what Comrade Ye said. I had no feeling at this time, I just wanted to hug her and kiss her to celebrate how well we had spent this afternoon.

　　法捷耶夫同志告诉了我些什么
    （续完）
    丁玲
    梭芙洛罗夫却继续告诉他个人的故事，他在一九三○年写了“第一骑兵队”（写布加宁的故事），高尔基读后即刻就写了一封信给他，他到现在还保存着。他个人也提拔了四个作家，并且他热情的说起斯大林，斯大林同志几乎看每个作品，而且都记得，今年春天他同作家们谈了四个多钟头，那时国际问题很紧张，但仍来谈每个作品，每个人他也知道，有些作品连作家们也忘了，可是他还记得。他还做了个总结，他们是极友谊的指出是非，他最看重文学。于是我也告诉他们我们的毛主席也是这样，他每天都看党报的副刊，我们的作品他都记得，他亲自领导我们开会，替我们解决重大的问题，他的文艺座谈会讲话可以成为世界名言。
    梭芙洛罗夫同志对于我谈起毛主席的故事，表示了很大的兴趣，我一点也没有感觉得时间走得太快，柳芭又提醒我应该谈到出版的问题了。我不得不再看表，已经五点半钟了。于是我忙着把我带来的书，李有才板话，光荣属于勇士，无敌三勇士，暴风骤雨，白毛女，血泪仇等十几本书一本一本的介绍给他们听，几个人都围起来看，他们答应我说要找人翻译，翻译后批评，并且将意见告诉我们。我又把古元和彦涵的木刻介绍给他们，这里面是有目录、说明和作者小传的，因此他们也答应我将同样一份转给美术杂志，并且设法出版。他们能否做到呢，我不知道，但我是极其相信他们的，虽然那里面是有那么多的艰难的中国的古代文字，但他们一定有办法去克服。
    苏联的出版是惊人的，有国家的总出版局，还有各个部门的，如同青年，儿童，职工，妇女都各有各的。作家协会的出版处，管理人员与报纸杂志就有二百多工作人员，他们今年共印八百万本书（一百二十种），共费三千吨纸。稿费之多，使中国文艺工作者听来怕人，一页（十六个Ｐ）一千五百卢布到四千卢布。普通工人工资每月五六百卢布，最低工资三百卢布（斯达汉诺夫者的工资是非常之高的）。因为每种书销路多，版税就更多。知识劳动的代价在苏联一般是非常重视的。
    梭芙洛罗夫和维斯内夫斯基都是戏剧家，另外两个年青的作家也是搞戏的人，他们对于我和戏剧的关系很为关心，特别知道我领导过西北战地服务团感到兴趣，但不管怎样，时间已经到了六点，是到了应该告辞的时候了。我特别对维斯内夫斯基感到抱歉，因为没有机会让我们交换些意见，他总是很注意的听、却很少讲话。出版的问题也没有详细的谈。那位头发梳得特别光亮的出版家，他答应写一份材料，包括章程，计划，情况，他笑着说，“一定统统都有。”
    在楼下穿大衣的时候，叶同志告诉我，这栋房子是战争与和平小说中女主人公娜塔沙的房子，我又埋怨他起来了：“唉，你们什么不早告诉我。”他笑了，却问道：“谈话给你的印象怎么样？”我没有答应，只反问他对我所谈的问题有什么意见。他说：“很重要，而且很有意义。”
    在回去的路上，叶同志成了一个爱说话的人了。他也是坐在前边车夫旁边的，把整个身子朝后边，有时说几句中国话，没有办法了，就说俄国话，有时称呼我丁先生，有时称呼丁同志，有时也直呼我丁玲。我最记得的是他说：“你一定要设法再来，你要再来，我和她（指柳芭）尽可能帮助你，我一定帮助你。”他的热情影响了常跟着他的那位极年青的秘书，她本来是很少说话的，现在也好象我的一位小妹妹。柳芭就更辛苦的。车子内的空气真是变得这样可爱，但一下就到了旅馆门口，叶同志把我送出来，和我告辞时还叮嘱我要设法再来。他使我对他有些依依惜别了。
    我和柳芭坐到饭桌上时，我的手在拿匙子时都发抖，我在发现我还是早上吃了两片面包的，作家协会虽然摆满了一桌子的点心糖果，他们也殷勤的让过，但我那时却觉得很饱，为欢喜和兴奋填得太饱，简直一点什么也没有吃，现在才觉得肚子里十分空虚。我想到这里，就更笑起来了。柳芭问我笑什么，我说：“咱们在房子里准备的那么多的讲演，一句也没用上，太可惜你的经过修饰的漂亮的词句了！哈………”柳芭却正经的答道：“我以为还是这样说比准备的更好。”我说：“真的吗？”他又答应真的，而且加添说，你要记得叶同志的话。我这时什么感觉也没有了，只想拥抱她，和她接吻，来庆贺我们今天下午过得这样的好。
