　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 15th: London - The strike by London dockworkers, which began on the 11th, is continuing. According to Agence France-Presse, the number of striking workers has increased from 15,000 to 19,000. British newspapers acknowledge that the entire Port of London has been paralyzed. The Thames is filled with ships of all sizes from various countries, and the bourgeois press is calling on the Labour government to take actions similar to those taken last summer, namely to declare martial law. Minister of Labour Isaac told the House of Commons on the 13th that the government is considering taking all steps to ensure the normal operation of the docks. The British Cabinet held an emergency meeting on the 13th for this purpose and decided that if the workers do not return to work by the beginning of next week, the army will be used to replace the workers in unloading cargo. The London dockworkers' strike is in support of dockworkers who have been deemed unfit for work and dismissed due to old age or injury.

　　码头工人继续罢工伦敦海港已陷停顿
    【新华社北平十五日电】伦敦讯：十一日开始的伦敦码头工人的罢工，仍在继续进行。据法新社讯，罢工工人已由一万五千人扩大至一万九千人。英国报纸承认，整个伦敦港已陷于停顿。泰晤士河中塞满各国大小船只，资产阶级报纸呼吁工党政府采取类似去年夏季所采取的行动，即宣布戒严。劳工部部长伊萨克于十三日告下院说：政府考虑采取一切步骤保证码头工作正常进行。英内阁已为此于十三日曾举行紧急会议，决定如工人在下周初仍不复工，将使用军队来代替工人卸货。伦敦码头工人的罢工是支援因年老或受伤而被列为不宜工作予以开除的码头工人。
