　　Light in the Desert
    Mongolian Notes
    By A. Avdeyev, translated by Wang Fei
    The People's Republic of Mongolia covers an area of 1.5 million square kilometers, with the barren but picturesque Mongolian Altai Mountains running through it. The mountain peaks are often covered with snow that never melts, like wearing a white hat. There are also the endless Khangai forests and the emerald green Kerulen River, which flows through the fertile grasslands of the plains. To the south lies the vast desert stretching for thousands of kilometers. This sea of desert is sometimes flat and sometimes rolls up into ridges of sand. The herders who live in this area (called Alatts in Mongolian) lead a difficult and harsh life. In winter, fierce blizzards and severe cold freeze the land as hard as stone. People then huddle in yurts and light fires. When the flames leap merrily in the stove, the pot exudes a strong tea aroma, and thick camel milk bubbles, the blizzard is not only not frightening, but the simple yurt almost feels like paradise. In summer, the desert sometimes heats up to 60 to 70 degrees Celsius, like a brazier. At this time, water is as precious as gold. Because the health of the livestock depends on water, and the health and prosperity of the livestock are equivalent to the entirety of life.

    Mongolia was for a long time a Chinese colony, subjected to the cruel exploitation and plunder of foreign merchants. In 1918, the herders’ debts to large Chinese commercial firms reached 50 million gold rubles. The Dashenghu (transliteration) family company alone collected annual interest of 700,000 sheep and dairy cows, and 500,000 other livestock. The vast majority of livestock were in the hands of foreign capitalists and Mongolian feudal landlords and lama temples. Mongolia once had 700 lama temples and 100,000 lamas, accounting for 40 percent of the total male population.

    After the Mongolian People's Revolution in 1921, the Mongolian herders began a new life. They became masters of their country, land, and livestock. New people appeared in the deserts, grasslands, and mountains—doctors, teachers, veterinarians, and livestock experts. For the first time in Mongolian history, a government emerged to serve the health, welfare, and culture of the people, and began to transform the old, backward way of life.

    Livestock breeding is the foundation of Mongolia's national economy. The vast grasslands provide unlimited opportunities for the development of livestock industry. The material conditions of Mongolians are calculated by the number of their livestock. In 1918, Mongolia had an average of 18 head of livestock per person, but the vast majority belonged to feudal landlords, lamas, and Chinese merchants. By 1947, the average livestock per person had increased to 30, and each herding family had an average of 130 head of livestock. The total number of livestock had more than doubled, of which 99 percent belonged to the herders, and state-owned ranches accounted for only 1 percent. The state helps herders promote livestock breeding rates and feeding methods, established hundreds of veterinary stations, livestock treatment research institutes, biological experiment stations, improved pastures, opened up new water sources, and established grass cutting machine stations.

    Mongolia—the land of livestock herders, until recently imported cheese from abroad. Today, the People's Republic of Mongolia has approximately 180 well-equipped condensed milk factories, producing 156,000 poods of high-quality cheese annually. Cheese is increasingly playing an important role in its exports.

    Wool is one of Mongolia's basic products. Thousands upon thousands of camels carry wool from all over the country to wool combing factories or transportation stations from autumn until winter, and then return various goods from these places.

    Mongolia's industry, mainly the industry that manufactures local raw materials, is growing year by year. Many factories have been established in the Ulaanbaatar (Kuren) area, including leather, saddle, shoe, food, wool spinning, wool weaving factories, as well as an auto parts manufacturing factory and a power plant. In addition, there are hundreds of handicraft cooperatives.

    Mongolia's young working class already numbers in the tens of thousands. They eagerly learn new technologies and launch competitions with each other to complete plans. Women have also entered the factories, with 1,500 women shock workers emerging, 400 of whom have received government medals.

    In December 1947, the first five-year plan (from 1948 to 1952) for the development of the national economy and culture was passed. Its main goal is to comprehensively develop the country's productive forces, improve cultural education and healthcare, and raise the material and political level of the working people. By the time the five-year plan is completed, the total number of livestock belonging to the herders will reach 31,025,000 head. The livestock breeding rate will be increased. This extremely important economic sector will no longer be allowed to be dominated by blind nature. The state will help herders store fodder with ten times as many grass-making factories as now, that is, 120 factories. They will also help improve livestock breeding methods.

    During these five years, 40,000 livestock wintering sheds will be built in the Khangai wool-producing area, and herders in the grassland areas of the Great Desert will receive 50,000 such mobile sheds. Herders are preparing to dig 20,000 wells in grazing areas, not counting the 100 wells equipped with water pumps that the state plans to build.

    As in the past, livestock breeding will mainly be based on individual herding families. However, the government has been adopting more progressive breeding forms and methods. Herders' production cooperatives have existed for several years. There are now one hundred such cooperatives. A portion of their livestock is collectively owned. Herders are eager to expand this collectivity and strengthen it economically and organizationally.

    Within five years, industrial production is expected to increase by 97 percent, almost doubling.

    The Nalaikha mine, which supplies coal to the Mongolian capital, produced only a few thousand tons of coal each year before the revolution, and was mined using the most primitive methods. After the revolution, the Nalaikha mine has been modernized, and by the time the five-year plan is completed, it will produce 542,000 tons of coal annually. Other mineral deposits will also be surveyed.

    In South Gobi Province, many changes have taken place in the economic and cultural life of the herders over the past few years. People's lives have improved, leading to significant progress in cultural levels. The government has allocated large sums of money to establish schools and popularize education. Although less than one percent of the population was literate before the People's Revolution, now almost half of the population is literate. In the past, there was only one non-lama-run school in the country that could accommodate 50 students. Today, virtually every adult and child in a Mongolian yurt is studying, even in the most remote villages.

    We visited many villages in South Gobi, and in every place, people can see a new and healthy generation in the people's actions and hopes for a better future. The people have criticized the existing methods and forms of economic endeavors. At a meeting in Nuoyan Village, we heard moving speeches calling for the large-scale use of collective labor methods. Herders in many districts and villages have also expressed the same ideas.

    The streets of Ulaanbaatar (Kuren) are indeed very pleasant on summer evenings. The daytime heat has disappeared in the face of the fresh cool air blowing from the surrounding mountains. The air is refreshing and peaceful. When the street lights illuminate, the dazzling characters appear at the entrance of the National Theatre: Tonight's performance of Simonov's "The Russian Question." The cinema is showing "Soldier Matrosov" and "Alisher Navoi." The Mongolian Film Studio also shot a newsreel about the glorious deeds of Mongolian men and women in completing the five-year plan.

    There is still much work to be done in the construction of the Mongolian capital, but every day you can see that the city is being improved. Thousands of working people, men and women, participate in voluntary labor days. Among these volunteers, you can see members of the Central Committee of the People's Revolutionary Party and members of the Republic's government, who work side by side with ordinary herders.

    The Mongolian people are moving forward with confidence. Creative construction labor is transforming this country, enabling it to move directly from feudalism to socialism without going through the stage of capitalism. In this regard, they have a strong and loyal neighbor—the Soviet Union—as their backing, and are constantly giving them fraternal assistance. (Excerpted from the first issue of New Times, 1949)

　　沙漠里的光明
    蒙古记行
    作者  Ａ·阿夫德也夫  王飞译
    蒙古人民共和国面积有一百五十万平方公里，境内绵亘着荒凉的，但富于画意的蒙古阿尔泰山，山头上经常积雪不化，象戴着一顶白帽子一样。这里还有一望无际的杭爱森林和环流于平原肥沃草地区的碧绿的克鲁伦河。它的南面是迤逦数千公里的大沙漠。这个沙漠之海有时很平坦，有时卷起一道道沙梁。居住这块地方的牧民们（蒙语叫阿拉特），生活是艰苦而严厉的。冬季凛冽的暴风雪和严寒，把土地冻得象石头一样的僵硬。人们这时都躲在蒙古包里，生起火来。当炉里悠然地跳跃着火头，锅里冒出强烈的茶香，浓密的骆驼乳嘟嘟地沸腾起来的时候，暴风雪不但不可怕，而且简单朴素的幕蓬里，简直又如天堂了。到了夏天，沙漠里有时热到摄氏六十至七十度，象一个火盆一样。这时候，水是和金子一样的贵重。因为，牲畜的健壮与否要取决于水，而牲畜的健壮与兴旺，也就等于生活的全部。
    蒙古在一个长时期中曾经是中国的殖民地，受着外国商人残酷的剥削与劫掠。一九一八年，牧民们见中国大商号的债务达五千万金卢布。大神户（译音）一家公司一年所收的利息即达羊和乳牛七十万头，其他牲畜五十万头。绝大部份的牲口都握在外国资本家和蒙古封建地主和喇嘛庙的手里。蒙古曾有喇嘛庙七百所，喇嘛十万人，占全部男丁的百分之四十。
    一九二一年蒙古人民革命后，蒙古牧民开始新的生活。他们变成了他们国家、土地和牲畜的主人。沙漠、草原和山岳里出现了崭新的人——医生、教师、兽医和牧畜专家。在蒙古历史上，第一次出现了为人民的健康、福利与文化而服务的政府，开始改造旧的落后的生活方式。
    饲养牲畜是蒙古国民经济的基础。一望无际的草原提供了发展牲畜业的无限机会。蒙古人的物质条件是以其牲畜多寡来计算的。一九一八年，蒙古平均每人有牲畜十八头，但其中绝大部份是属于封建地主、喇嘛和中国商人的。一九四七年，每人平均的牲畜增到三十头，每个牧民家庭平均有牲畜一百三十头。整个牲畜的数目增加了一倍多，其中百分之九十九属于牧民，国营牧场只占百分之一。国家帮助牧民们提倡牲畜的繁殖率和饲养方法，建立了成百所的兽医站、牲畜治疗研究所、生物试验所，改善牧场，开辟新水源，建立切草机器站。
    蒙古——这块牧畜者天地，在不久以前，还从外面输入乳酪。今天，蒙古共和国具有头等装备的炼乳厂约一百八十所，年产上等乳酪十五万六千普特。乳酪在它的出口中已日益居于重要的地位了。
    羊毛是蒙古的基本出产之一。成千成万的骆驼，从秋季直至冬季，从各地驮着羊毛运到刷毛厂或运输站，然后又从这些地方运回各种货物。
    蒙古的工业，主要是制造当地原料的工业，正逐年增长着。乌兰巴托（即库伦）区已经建立了许多工厂，其中有制革、鞍辔、制鞋、食品、纺毛、毛织及一个汽车机件制造厂和一个电力厂。此外，还有成百个手工业合作社。
    蒙古年轻的工人阶级已经数以万计。他们热切地学习新的技术，并为完成计划而相互展开竞赛。妇女也进入了工厂，涌出了一千五百名妇女突击手，其中四百人得到了政府的奖章。
    一九四七年十二月，发展国民经济与文化的第一个五年计划，（从一九四八至一九五二）通过了。它的主要目标是全盘地发展国家的生产力，提高文化教育与保健工作，提高劳动人民的物质生活与政治水平。到了五年计划完成时，属于牧民的牲畜总数将达三千一百零二万五千头。牲畜的繁殖率将被提高。这一极重要的经济部门，将不再允许它由盲目的自然来支配。国家将以十倍于现在的制草厂，即一百二十个厂，来帮助牧民储存饲草。它们同时帮助改良牲畜繁殖的方法。
    在这五年中，在杭爱产毛区，将建筑牲畜冬季饲养棚四万所，大沙漠中草原地带的牧民将得到五万个这样活动的饲养棚。牧民们预备在放牧地区掘井二万孔，国家计划建筑的附有抽水机的一百孔水井，尚不计算在内。
    如同过去一样，牲畜的饲养将主要建筑在个体牧民家庭的基础上。但是，政府已在采取更进步的饲养形式与方法。牧民生产合作社若干年来即已存在。这种合作社现在有一百个。他们一部份的牲畜是共有的。牧民很希望能扩大这种集体性，并在经济上和组织上加强它。
    在五年之内，工业生产量预计增加百分之九十七，即几乎增加一倍。
    供给蒙古首府煤斤的纳莱哈矿井，革命前每年产煤仅数千吨，而且是用最原始的方法开采。在革命后，纳莱哈矿井已被现代化，至五年计划完成时，它将每年产煤五十四万二千吨。其他矿藏亦将加以勘测。
    在南戈壁省，牧民们过去几年来的经济生活和文化生活已发生许多变化。人民的生活改善了，从而引起了文化水平的显著进步。政府拨了大笔款子来建立学校和普及教育。虽然在人民革命前能读能写的人不到百分之一，但现在已几乎有一半人能读能写了。过去，全国只有一所能容学生五十人的非喇嘛办的学校。今天，实际上每个蒙古包里的大人和儿童都在念书，即使在最偏僻的乡村也是如此。
    我们访问了南戈壁的许多乡村，在每个地方，人们都可以人民的行动和对将来更好生活的希望中，看到新的健康的一代。人民对现存经济努力的方法和形式，已经提出批评。在诺岩村的一个会上，我们听到了要求更大规模地使用集体劳动方法的动人演说。许多区、村的牧民们也表示了同样的思想。
    乌兰巴托（库伦）的市街在夏天的晚间的确是很令人愉快的。白天的闷热在四周山中吹来的新鲜凉空气面前消失了。空气清爽而宁静。当街灯放光的时候，国立剧院的门口就显出光耀夺目的大字：今晚演出西蒙诺夫的“俄罗斯问题”。电影院放映着“士兵马特罗佐夫”与“阿里莎·纳伏伊”。蒙古制片厂也摄制了一个蒙古男女在完成五年计划光荣事迹的新闻片子。
    蒙古首都的建设，仍有很多工作待做，但是每天你都可以看见这座城市在被改善中。成千的劳动人民，男的和女的，参加自愿劳动日。在这些自愿参加的人们中，你可以看到有人民革命党的中央委员和共和国政府的委员们，他们和普通牧民并肩地劳作。
    蒙古人民正在充满信心地向前迈进。创造性的建设劳动正在改造这个国家，使它不经过资本主义的阶段，直接由封建主义走向社会主义。在这方面，他们有强大而忠诚的邻邦——苏联，作他们的后盾，并正给他们以不断的兄弟般的帮助。（节译自一九四九年新时代第一期）
