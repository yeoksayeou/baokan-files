　　Recommending a Soviet Masterpiece
　　“Siberian Symphony”
　　Lǐ Xíng
　　This is a musical film that won the "Labor Prize" and "Color Prize" at the International Film Presentation Conference (and previously won the Stalin First Class Prize domestically). Of the sixty-one feature and short films from eighteen participating countries at the time (including the Soviet Union, Poland, the United States, France, the United Kingdom, Italy, etc.), "Siberian Symphony" along with two other Soviet films, "The Russian Question" and "The Third Blow," received the highest praise. The outstanding artistic achievement of "Siberian Symphony" demonstrates the victory of socialist cinema art. Whether in content or form, it far surpasses the productions of capitalist film studios such as "Hollywood" in the United States and "Eagle-Lion" in the United Kingdom. Take a few British and American musical films with stronger artistic merit, such as "Waterloo Bridge" and "Stairway to Heaven," for example. The entire film is permeated with melancholy, sadness, and unhealthy emotions. Soviet films, on the other hand, are all cheerful, healthy, and powerful, as exemplified by "Siberian Symphony."
　　This film is a hymn to Soviet Siberia, a musical work about the patriotic laborers of the Soviet people. The barbaric Tsars turned the Siberian land into a frontier of suffering, death, and forced labor, but the proletarian revolution changed the face of Siberia, and Stalin's Five-Year Plan transformed it into a paradise for the happy people. This is the motivation of the film's creator—the talented director Ivan Pyryev—in making this film. At the same time, this film points out the inseparable relationship between Soviet artists and the people and criticizes the art-for-art's-sake view of art. Pyryev expresses these rich contents through the beautiful story of a Siberian young musician's successful struggle. In addition, the color of this film even surpasses "The Stone Flower." The Siberian sunrise and the Arctic snowstorms are truly beautiful. As for the film's music, it breaks the old form of musical films, and the entire film is a beautiful piece of music from beginning to end.
　　In this film, you will see how a musician overcomes difficulties with strong perseverance; you will see the great creativity of the Soviet people and their love for their socialist motherland; you will see the life of the happy Soviet working people. Every audience member, especially those working in the arts, will gain rich inspiration from this film. We can also see the happy future of New China in this film. This film not only reflects the happy life of the Soviet people but also reflects the new morality of socialist society, radiating the light of noble and true humanity. Only in socialist countries can people with such beautiful character be produced.

　　推荐苏联名片
  　“西伯利亚交响乐”
    李行
    这是一部在国际影片献映大会上获得“劳动奖金”“彩色奖金”（在国内曾获得斯大林一等奖金）的音乐影片。当时参加献演的十八个国家（包括苏联、波兰、美、法、英、意等）的六十一部长短影片中，“西伯利亚交响乐”与其他两部苏联影片“俄罗斯问题”、“第三次打击”，均获得了最高的评价。“西伯利亚交响乐”卓越的艺术成就，说明了社会主义国家电影艺术的胜利，它无论在内容或形式上，都远远的超过了美国“好莱坞”、英国“鹰狮”等资本主义国家影片厂的出品。就拿几部英美艺术性较强的音乐片：“剑胆琴心”、“来世怨缘”来说，贯穿在整个影片中的都是些忧郁的、伤感的、不健康的情感。而苏联影片则都是愉快的、健康的、有力的，如“西伯利亚交响乐”就是一例。
    这部影片是苏维埃西伯利亚的赞美歌，是关于苏联人民爱国主义劳动者的音乐作品。野蛮的沙皇把西伯利亚大地变成了苦难、死亡、劳役的边疆，但是无产阶级革命改变了西伯利亚的面貌，斯大林的五年计划使它变成了幸福的人民乐园。这就是这影片制作人——天才导演伊凡·贝利耶夫制作这影片的动机。同时这影片指出了苏联艺术家与人民的血肉关系，并批判了为艺术而艺术的艺术观。贝利耶夫通过了一个西伯利亚青年音乐家奋斗成功的美妙故事，表现出这些丰富的内容。另外，这影片的彩色比起“宝石花”来，实有过之无不及。西伯利亚的日出，北极的风雪，真是美极了。至于该片的音乐，更是打破了旧的音乐片的形式，从头至尾整个片子就是一个优美的乐曲。
    在这部影片里，你将看到一个音乐家怎样的以坚强的毅力克服了困难；你将看到苏联人民伟大的创造力与他们对于社会主义祖国的热爱；你将看到幸福的苏联劳动人民的生活。每一个观众，尤其是艺术工作者，将从这部影片中得到丰富的启示。我们也可以在本片中看出新中国的幸福远景。这部影片不但反映出苏联人民的幸福生活，更反映出社会主义社会的新道德，放射着崇高的真正人性的光辉。全世界上只有在社会主义国家里才能产生出这样美丽性格的人来。
