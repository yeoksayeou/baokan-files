Taiyue Administrative Office
　　Punishes Speculator Wu Xide

　　[Taiyue Electricity] The Tongyi Yong Flower Shop, owned by private merchant Wu Xide in Nanfan Town, Jiang County, repeatedly engaged in speculation during price fluctuations. To serve as a warning, the Taiyue District Administrative Office has imposed a fine of 1,500 yuan. During last winter's price fluctuations, this flower shop colluded with Wang Shangkun of the Jishuncheng production organization in Yangcheng County. On the 16th day of the eleventh lunar month, they raised the price of cotton by one yuan per catty. On the 6th day of the twelfth lunar month, they raised it again by four yuan, and on the 23rd day, they raised it by another two yuan and five jiao, engaging in speculative manipulation and reaping huge profits. On March 5th of this year, the shop borrowed 30,000 yuan recently withdrawn from the bank to disrupt grain prices in the market. At that time, wheat was 3,300 yuan per dan, but the shop took advantage of the farmers' honesty and bought 4.8 dan of wheat from Zhang Quanli of Xiwu Village for 3,000 yuan. When the masses asked to buy one or two dou, the shop refused, insisting on selling it for 3,500 yuan, 200 yuan higher than the market price, causing the price to rise suddenly that day. When the shop bought grain, Comrade Qiao Guangwen of the trade company educated him face to face, but he ignored it. Based on the report from the Second Special District Office, the shop engaged in speculative manipulation, repeatedly committing offenses without repentance. The Administrative Office has decided to impose a penalty.

　　太岳行政公署
  　处罚投机商吴希德
    【太岳电】绛县南樊镇私商吴希德的同义永花店，因在物价波动中屡次投机，太岳区行政公署为警效尤，特给予一千五百元的罚金处分。按该花店于去冬物价波动中，与阳城县生产机关集顺成的王尚坤结合，在阴历十一月十六日将棉花每斤提高一元，十二月初六日又提高四元，二十三日又提高二元五角，投机操纵，获利很大。本年三月五日该店又借刚由银行抽来的三万元，在市场上扰乱粮价，当时麦子三千三百元一大石，但该店欺负农民老实，将西吴村张全礼的四石八斗麦子，以三千元买下，群众要求分买一、二斗，该店均拒绝不给，硬要另售三千五百元，高于市价两百元，使当天物价突然提高。当该店买粮时，贸易公司乔广文同志曾当面对其教育，但却置之不理。据此二专署报告，该店投机操纵，屡犯不改，经行政公署决定予以处罚。
