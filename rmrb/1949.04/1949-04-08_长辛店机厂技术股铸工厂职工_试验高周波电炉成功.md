　　Changxindian Machine Factory Technology Section Foundry Workers Successfully Experiment with High-Frequency Induction Furnace
    [Ping City News] Workers in the Technology Section and Foundry of the Changxindian Machine Factory have successfully experimented with a "high-frequency induction furnace." During the Kuomintang period, the factory had experimented with a steel-melting high-frequency induction furnace for seven months. Although it could melt steel, the temperature was insufficient, and the resulting molten steel was always like a paste. Moreover, the refractory material of the furnace wall was not strong at high temperatures; the lining could only be used once per melt. This time, after the diligent research of the foundry and technology section workers, they used waste materials stockpiled for many years from the Recycling Factory and used cylindrical magnesite refractory bricks as a lining. The experimental results showed that three furnaces of steel were melted in six hours, and the bricks were not damaged at all. The steel melting time was shortened, and much less electricity was used. The fastest furnace took only seventy-seven minutes to melt. The workers said: "Although we have succeeded, we must continue to work hard to improve it and make it a complete machine."

    [Another News] Zhang Deshan, a fitter in the Punching Department of the First Institute of the 70th Ordnance Factory, created a set of punches for flattening head cap nails, making a great contribution to the manufacture of ×× bullet parts. Using this new tool, the number of pieces punched by each person each day is twelve and a half times greater than in the past. Comrade Zhang has also had two new creations in the past: one is a small gear punch, and the other is a rolling machine. These two machines increase work efficiency fourfold.

  　试验高周波电炉成功
    【平市讯】长辛店机厂技术股、铸工厂职工试验“高周波电炉”成功。该厂熔钢高周波电炉在国民党时期曾试验了七个月，虽然能熔钢，但是温度不够，化出来的钢水都是酱状，而且炉壁耐火材料在高温下不坚固。一次衬底化一次钢就不能再用了。这次经该厂铸工厂及技术股职工努力研究后，用再制品厂堆存多年的废料，用圆筒形镁砂耐火砖做衬里，经试验结果，六小时即熔化三炉钢，炼瓦一点都没有损毁。熔钢时间缩短，用电也省多了。其中熔钢最快的一炉，仅用时七十七分钟。职工们表示：“虽然成功了，但仍要继续努力改进，使它成为完备的机器。”

    【又讯】七十兵工厂第一所冲压部钳工部工人张德山，创造一套冲平头帽钉的冲具，对于××弹零件的制造贡献很大，利用此种新工具，每人每天冲制的数目十二倍半于过去。张同志过去亦曾有过两种新创造：一为小型冲齿机，一为卷筒机，这两种机械提高工作效率四倍。
