　　Workers and Citizens of Beiping and Tianjin Warmly Comfort
  　and See Off the Southern-Bound Army
  　Guaranteeing Increased Production to Support the Yangtze River Crossing People's Liberation Army
    [Comprehensive report from this newspaper] The people of the Beiping and Tianjin area warmly comforted and saw off the Fourth Field Army, formerly the Northeast People's Liberation Army, as it headed south. Factories, schools, and government offices in Beiping and Tianjin established committees to rush-produce banners and gifts for the troops, and held grand send-off rallies. Employees of the Tianjin Yibei Electric Power Company, the Municipal Enterprise Company, and other units donated money and wrote letters of appreciation. All 800 employees of the East Railway Station wrote to the southern-bound troops, saying, "We will strengthen our work to support your battle. Wherever you fight, we will drive the train there!" Employees of the privately-owned Hengyuan Yarn Factory and Fuxing Paper Mill stayed up all night to rush-produce banners. Many factories and schools held joint military-civilian celebrations. After holding a celebration with the southern-bound soldiers, all the employees of Dasheng Yarn Factory escorted the People's Liberation Army back to their station, and more than 300 citizens and more than 20 rickshaw pullers joined the procession along the way. The Third District held a grand send-off rally of more than 20,000 people. When a unit of the People's Liberation Army set off for the southern expedition, the masses showed unparalleled excitement and attachment, singing "The People's Liberation Army March" and shouting slogans such as "Long live Chairman Mao!" and "Long live the People's Liberation Army!" The female workers of Hengyuan Yarn Factory specially composed songs, singing: "The People's Liberation Army charges forward, we will not relax production!" The masses sending off troops in the Tenth District escorted them all the way to Balitai in the suburbs. Many female workers were sweating profusely, but still closely followed the ranks. When the People's Liberation Army bid farewell to the masses, cheers and blessings resounded in unison. Citizens gave the soldiers a large number of gifts. Residents of the Fourth District of the city embroidered words such as "Successful Crossing of the Yangtze River" and "Meritorious Service for the People" on more than 200 comfort bags and towels. Li Zongfu, a poor citizen of the Fifth District, personally took 30 yuan RMB to the district government to comfort the troops. He said: Although the money is not much, it expresses my feelings. More than 200 representatives of workers in Beiping and representatives from Peking University, Tsinghua University, and other schools rushed to the station of a certain army with a large number of gifts to express their appreciation. The representatives asked the commanders and fighters to plant the red flag of victory in Nanjing, Guangzhou, and Taiwan. On the eve of the army's departure to the south, people from all over held farewell rallies, presented flags and flowers, and gave various gifts. Employees of the 70th Ordnance Factory held a warm farewell rally on the 6th, presenting the 3rd company of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army with a banner reading "Strive to be the First Company to Cross the Yangtze River." Citizens of the Tenth District and the guard troops held a joint celebration attended by more than 20,000 people on the 4th. He Zhushan, a worker, shouted to the People's Liberation Army at the meeting: "Don't worry, we are determined to intensify production under the leadership of Chairman Mao and support you in eliminating the enemy!" When the 2nd company of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army set off, residents cooked eggs and stuffed them into the pockets of every soldier who resolutely refused. Before dawn, the old landlady automatically got up to boil water for the soldiers. The residents helped tidy up the luggage and prepare the horses. When the training team gathered and set off, the residents surrounded the troops for a final farewell. A resident representative just said, "Only after you came did we have a peaceful year," and was so excited that he cried and couldn't continue. When the troops started moving, the residents spontaneously formed teams to send them off. Everyone scrambled to hold the soldiers' hands, walking and instructing them to take good care of their health on the road. The village cadres repeatedly shouted to the soldiers: "Your family's life will not be difficult, you can rest assured to go south and eliminate the reactionaries." Everyone kept sending them off for six or seven miles before stopping, and then the people from the next village who were sending off the troops greeted them.
