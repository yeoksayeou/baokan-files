Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 27th: According to a United Press dispatch from Tokyo on the 22nd, transmitted by the Central News Agency, MacArthur still intends to carry out armed intervention in China under the pretext of protecting overseas Chinese. The dispatch stated: "The U.S. Far East military authorities are prepared to execute any orders from Washington to protect the lives and property of Americans in China. If necessary, U.S. aircraft and warships can be transferred from Japan to China to protect American interests." It also said: "MacArthur has recently been extremely concerned about the development of the situation in China. He has long envisioned supplying China with military materials, and his consistent view of China is that China has strategic importance to the United States." It is reported that MacArthur instructed the President of the University of Pennsylvania, Stassen, on the 1st of this month to propose a "MacArthur Plan" to aid the Kuomintang in South China to resist the People's Liberation Army with 1 billion US dollars annually. However, even the opinions of many big bourgeois Americans were lukewarm towards this warmonger's adventurous plan, because everyone can see that any so-called MacArthur Plan will inevitably be crushed under the hammer of the great Chinese people.

　　麦克阿瑟阴谋借口护侨
  　妄图武装干涉我国
    【新华社北平二十七日电】据中央社东京二十二日合众电透露，麦克阿瑟仍然打算在护侨的借口下对中国实行武装干涉。该电说：“美国远东军事当局已准备执行华府方面之任何命令，以保障在华美人之生命财产。如有必要，美国之飞机、战舰可自日本调华，保护美国之权益”。又说：“麦克阿瑟迩来极度关切中国局势之发展，渠久已设想应以军火供应给予中国，渠对华之一贯看法为中国对美国有战略上之重要性。”按麦克阿瑟曾授意美国宾夕法尼亚大学校长史塔生于本月一日提出一项每年以十亿美元援助国民党在华南抵抗人民解放军的“麦克阿瑟计划”。但甚至美国许多大资产阶级的舆论也对这个黩武主义者的冒险计划表示冷淡，因为人人都看得到，任何所谓麦克阿瑟计划，在伟大的中国人民的锤击之下，必将归于粉碎。
