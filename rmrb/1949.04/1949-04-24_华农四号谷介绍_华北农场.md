Introduction to Huanong No. 4 Millet
　　North China Farm

　　This millet variety was originally selected from the spring-sown millet "Mao Mao Huang" near Shijiazhuang. When the villagers planted Mao Mao Huang, it was very messy. Our farm selected the best ear from Mao Mao Huang and, after several years of continuous testing, breeding, and promotion, now has enough seeds for seven hundred hectares. This millet seed has many advantages over the original Mao Mao Huang, including higher yield, uniformity, and consistent maturity. Therefore, it is also called "Huanong No. 4 Millet." Under normal management conditions, its yield averages around 450 jin per mu. The millet grains are large, and the rice yield is high, with 75 to 80 jin of rice per 100 jin of millet. The rice quality is good, with no broken tips, yellow in color, uniform, and sticky, making it delicious for steaming cakes. The stalks are tall, and there is a lot of millet straw, with each mu yielding about 300 to 450 jin. The stalks are thick and sturdy, preventing lodging in strong winds. In years of flooding, temporary waterlogging in the fields will not kill it. For example, Jia Zhenling, an old farmer from Jia Village in Gaocheng, Hebei, planted 1.2 mu of this millet and 0.3 mu of local white millet. When the flood came, the white millet was drowned, but this millet was not affected by the water damage. Secondly, it is highly resistant to armyworms. For example, last year, among the 40 millet varieties planted at the Xinji Farm, only this one was not affected by armyworm damage. Hao Xiaoshan, an old farmer from Wangjiazhuang in Jin County, planted three mu of millet, half of which was local Qitou White Millet and half of which was this millet. With the same management, the Qitou White Millet was damaged by armyworms and yielded six bags, while this millet was not infested and yielded nine bags. The ears of this millet also have barbs, which protect them from wind damage and millet flies, and it does not develop black smut (black spike disease) and other benefits.

　　This millet also has disadvantages: the growing period is long, requiring about 125 days from sowing to maturity, but it does not affect wheat planting. It is prone to whitehead disease (i.e., old millet, hedgehog head). It is best not to plant it continuously in the same field. Paying attention to intercropping and sowing between the Beginning of Summer and Grain Full can reduce whitehead disease. It requires a lot of fertilizer and does not grow well in poor soil. It has a strong nutrient absorption capacity, depleting the soil. If less manure is applied, the land will not be fertile in the second year. Because the growing time is long, sowing around the Beginning of Summer is most suitable. When the seedlings grow to about 1.5 inches tall, they can be thinned. The distance between seedlings should be one chi for rows, and a cluster can be left every six to seven cun. Each cluster should retain two or three seedlings, as this millet does not branch much. If single seedlings are left, the distance between plants should be closer.

　　华农四号谷介绍
  　华北农场
    这种谷原由石家庄附近春播谷“毛毛黄”中选出。毛毛黄这个品种，老乡们种时非常杂乱，经本场由毛毛黄中选出最好的一穗，经数年继续试验繁殖和推广，到现在已有足种七百顷之种子。这谷种比原来的毛毛黄产量大、整齐、成熟一致，优点很多，因此另称为“华农四号谷”。它的产量在一般管理条件下，平均每亩可收四百五十斤左右。谷粒大、出米多，每百斤可碾米七十五斤至八十斤。米品质好，没有烂米尖，米黄色，整齐，有粘性，蒸饼子好吃，秆高谷草多，每亩可收三百至四百五十斤左右，秆粗坚硬，刮大风不倒，涝年田间一时过水不至淹死。如冀中藁城贾村老农贾真灵，种了一亩二分这种谷，三分当地白谷，发水时，白谷被水淹死了，这种谷未受水害。其次是抗粘虫力强。如去年在辛集农场中四十种谷种，只有这一种谷未受粘虫害。晋县王家庄老农郝小善种着三亩谷，一半当地齐头白谷，一半这种谷，同样管理结果，齐头白谷被粘虫所害，打了六袋，这种谷未上粘虫，打了九袋。这谷穗上还有刺毛，不怕大风磨穗子和谷蝇子，不生黑疸头（黑穗病）等好处。
    这种谷也有缺点：生长期间长，由播种至成熟须一百二十五日左右，但不影响种麦，易生白发病（即看谷老，刺猬头），最忌连续在一地种，如注意调楂和在立夏至小满间播种，可减少白发病。需要的肥料多，在坏地里长不好，吸肥力强，拔地，如果上粪少，第二年地就没有劲。因生长时间长，立夏前后播种最为适宜。当幼苗生长高约一寸半左右时，即可间苗，留苗之距离，一般的行距一尺，可隔六—七寸远留一丛，每全留苗两三株，因这种谷子分杈力不大，如留单苗，须将株距离近些，较为合宜。
