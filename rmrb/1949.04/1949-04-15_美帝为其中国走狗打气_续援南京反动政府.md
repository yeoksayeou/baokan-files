Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, April 14th: According to a Reuter dispatch from Washington on the 10th, U.S. imperialism, in order to encourage its Chinese lackeys to engage in a last-ditch struggle, has again passed a bill in its Congress to extend the "Aid to China Act" passed by the U.S. Congress on April 3rd of last year to February 15th of next year, using the remaining $54 million of the $400 million allocated by the act to continue aiding the Kuomintang reactionary government. This action by U.S. imperialism fully demonstrates that despite the impending final demise of the Kuomintang reactionary rule, U.S. imperialism, in order to continue its aggression against China and to coordinate with its overall conspiracy to launch a new world war, is still boosting the Kuomintang reactionaries. It is worth noting that the Nanjing Kuomintang government, which is currently conducting peace talks with the Chinese Communist Party, still has not expressed a willingness to break with U.S. imperialism and cease its traitorous policies. The puppet Executive Premier He Yingqin stated in Shanghai on March 14th that he was "happy to accept" U.S. aid, and on the 30th he declared in the puppet Legislative Yuan that he "welcomed foreign aid," listing this as one of the puppet Executive Yuan's "governing policies."

Another dispatch: Before the U.S. Congress passed the bill to continue aiding the Kuomintang government, General David Barr, former head of the U.S. military advisory group to the Kuomintang government, made secret reports on the "China situation" to the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the House Foreign Affairs Committee on March 24th and April 6th respectively. Barr returned to the U.S. from Japan in March.

　　美帝为其中国走狗打气　续援南京反动政府
    【新华社北平十四日电】据中央社华盛顿十日合众电：美帝国主义为鼓励其中国走狗进行垂死挣扎，又由其国会通过一项议案，决定将去年四月三日美国会所通过的“援华法案”延期至明年二月十五日，以该法案拨款四亿美元中尚未动用的五千四百万美元继续援助国民党反动政府。美帝国主义这个行动充分说明：尽管国民党反动统治即将最后死亡，但美帝国主义为了继续侵略中国，并配合其发动世界新战争的整个阴谋计划，仍在给国民党反动派打气。值得注意的是，正在与中国共产党进行和平谈判的南京国民党政府依然没有愿与美帝国主义决裂并停止卖国政策的表示。伪行政院长何应钦曾于三月十四日在上海声称对美援“乐于接受”，三十日又在伪立法院声明“欢迎外援”，并将此列为伪行政院的“施政方针”之一。
    另讯：美国会通过继续援助国民党政府的议案前，前驻国民党政府美军顾问团团长巴大维曾于三月二十四日及本月六日分别向美国参院外委会及众院外委会作关于“中国形势”的秘密报告。巴大维系于三月间由日本返美。
