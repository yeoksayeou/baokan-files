　　Jinnan Flour Company Produces Over Nine Hundred Bags Daily
  　Approaching Pre-War Level
    [Jinnan Electric] The Jinnan Flour Company's output surged in March, averaging 917 bags of flour per day, an increase of 41 bags compared to the February daily average of 876 bags. This approaches the pre-war level of 1,000 bags per day and is more than double the daily output of 400 to 500 bags during the enemy and puppet regime's rule. In addition, the original estimate was 80 jin of flour produced per 100 jin of wheat, but the current output is 82 to 83 jin. The original estimate for coal consumption was 38.99 jin per 100 jin of wheat, but it is now only 29 to 31 jin, saving two tons per day. The combined value of increased flour production and saved coal amounts to 6,945 yuan in Renminbi per day.
