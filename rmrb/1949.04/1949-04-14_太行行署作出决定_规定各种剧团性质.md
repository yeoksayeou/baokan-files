Taihang Telegraph: The Taihang Administrative Office has made a decision stipulating the nature and tasks of various theatrical troupes as follows: A. Rural theatrical troupes are amateur cultural life organizations of farmers, and should implement the self-directed, self-acted, self-sung, and self-entertained self-education policy. In principle, they should not leave the village, let alone be regarded as sideline production. The content of performances should reflect the reality of struggle life and serve production and war. The members of the troupe should participate voluntarily and be free to join and leave. Like all rural citizens, they bear the same obligations to the state and should not be treated specially. It is also necessary to oppose extravagance and waste, and prohibit the dissemination of feudal culture. B. Professional theatrical troupes are allowed to carry out activities outside the village, but must first register with the government. They can only perform approved repertoires. If they illegally perform banned programs, they will be given a penalty of suspension for a fixed period or even dissolution of the troupe. The guiding principle for professional theatrical troupes is: to encourage them to create and perform more new plays, and to adapt old plays as much as possible. C. The task of the special and county theatrical troupes is to use artistic forms to carry out policy publicity, and to demonstrate the rural theatrical troupes and other professional theatrical troupes within the scope of the entire special and county in terms of business. Therefore, the requirements are higher. However, some county theatrical troupes are still performing old plays and cannot play a demonstrative role. Therefore, it has been decided that all special and county theatrical troupes will be strictly registered and reviewed this year, with the standard of being able to implement the theatrical movement policy. Only those who have been reviewed and approved are legal special and county theatrical troupes. Those who are not legal should be transformed into professional theatrical troupes.

　　太行行署作出决定
  　规定各种剧团性质
    【太行电】太行行署作出决定，规定各种剧团的性质任务如下：甲、农村剧团是农民业余的文化生活组织，应贯彻自编自演自唱自乐的自我教育方针，原则上不出村，更不应作为副业生产。演出内容应反映现实斗争生活，为生产、战争服务。剧团之成员，应该是自愿参加，出入自由。和农村一切公民一样，对国家负担同样的义务，不能特殊。并须反对铺张浪费，禁止传播封建文化。乙、职业化剧团，允许出村活动，但须先向政府登记立案。并只能演出批准剧目，如违法演出已禁演之节目，要给以定期停演甚至解散剧团的处分。对职业剧团的指导方针是：鼓励其多编演新剧，尽量改编旧剧。丙、各专、县剧团的任务，是利用艺术形式，进行政策宣传，在业务上示范全专、县范围内的农村剧团及其他职业剧团，因此要求高一些，但目前若干县剧团仍在演旧剧，不能起示范作用，故决定今年各地专、县剧团，一律要进行严格登记审查，以能够执行剧运方针为标准。经审查核准后，方为合法的专、县剧团。不合法者，应转为职业剧团。
