Increased Production by One Tenth with Timely Sowing and Universal Manure Application
Ji'dong, Taihang, and Taiyue Issue Spring Plowing Instructions

[By Our Own Correspondent] The Ji'dong District Party Committee, in its spring plowing instructions issued on March 23rd, demanded that Party committees at all levels overcome all difficulties to ensure that all cultivated land is sown on time and to realize the sowing plans for cotton and peanuts. In areas where the burden on the masses is still heavy due to the army's operations, the burden should be adjusted immediately. In mountainous disaster areas, the difficulties of disaster victims must be resolved conscientiously and specifically, ensuring that all of their land is sown, and earnestly leading production for disaster relief. After proposing vigorously mobilizing women to participate in major agricultural labor, organizing small-scale labor exchange and mutual aid, and resolving the issue of substitute cultivation, the instructions emphasized that in all regions, it must be guaranteed that whoever sows will reap. In areas where land reform has not yet been carried out, it is equally important to vigorously mobilize and organize the masses to produce, paying close attention to avoiding land waste, and ensuring that whoever sows this year will reap. Local landlords and old-style rich peasants must abide by government laws and decrees and actively engage in production. If they engage in acts of sabotage of production, the government will severely punish them. The instructions stipulate that all public enterprises, in addition to ensuring the completion of seed loan plans, should also stabilize seed prices and avoid price increases.

[By Our Own Correspondent] The Taiyue District Party Committee has recently issued spring plowing instructions. Based on the situation of land reform and Party consolidation in the entire district, it has been determined that all efforts will be fully shifted to large-scale production after the end of April, mobilizing all peasants in the district to strive for a 10% increase in production. The instructions pointed out that all cadres must learn to do production work. In this year's spring plowing, attention should first be paid to resolving the ideological problems of the masses and publicizing the Party's various policies. Industrial raw materials should be produced as much as possible according to various conditions such as climate and soil quality. Secondly, consolidate and lead various forms of mutual aid that are suitable for the production season and needs of the masses. Third, solve the production difficulties of the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers and cadres going south. Fourth, broadly absorb women to participate in agricultural labor. Fifth, solve difficulties such as agricultural implements and draught animals. Sixth, when sowing arrives, strictly stop dispatching labor for other tasks in accordance with the regulations of the administrative office. Leadership should not only make general calls, but must go deep among the masses to provide specific leadership and learn to create and develop production experience.

[By Our Own Correspondent] The Taihang District Administrative Office issued spring plowing instructions on March 25th, requiring all localities to universally apply base fertilizer, with 5 dan (approximately 50 kg) of fertilizer per mu (approximately 1/6 of an acre) in old areas, and 3 dan in semi-old areas, and strive to hoe wheat fields once. Repair field edges and build embankments, eliminate 200,000 mu of uncultivated arable land on flat ground, build canals and wells to increase paddy fields by 150,000 mu, promote improved varieties, pay attention to preventing and controlling pests, and earnestly complete the sowing plan. To this end, it is necessary to widely publicize production policies, mobilize the enthusiasm of the masses, develop labor exchange and mutual aid, organize the purchase of livestock, and cooperatives should pay attention to solving the difficulties of production tools and materials. Finally, it was emphasized that all leading cadres must personally help the masses complete the production plan.

In addition, the Taihang Xinhua Daily also published an editorial entitled "Intensify the Spring Plowing Movement and Lay the Foundation for a One Inch Increase in Agricultural Production," calling on all localities to deepen publicity, overcome all ideological obstacles to spring plowing production, and specifically help the masses solve various difficulties in production. The editorial pointed out that many cadres simply understand "leadership" as "holding meetings" and "getting through ideas," lacking a patient and meticulous construction style, which is why they are not leading production well. The editorial finally pointed out that in this year's agricultural production, it is particularly necessary to organize labor exchange and mutual aid and establish supply and marketing cooperatives to solve the actual difficulties of spring plowing. Regarding spring plowing production in new areas, the editorial pointed out that the spring famine should be resolved first, and bandit suppression and other work must be carried out around production.

　　按期播种  普上的粪  增产一成
  　冀东太行太岳颁发春耕指示
    【本报讯】冀东区党委在上月二十三日发出的春耕指示中，要求各级党委克服一切困难，保证全部耕地按期播种，并实现棉花、花生的播种计划。其因大军作战，群众负担还重的地区，应即进行调整负担。在山地灾区，则须认真具体地解决灾民困难，保证灾民土地全部播种，并切实领导生产救灾。指示在提出大力发动妇女参加农业主要劳动，组织小型变工互助，解决代耕问题之后，着重说明在各种地区必须保证谁种谁收。在未经土地改革地区，同样以大力动员与组织群众生产，要十分注意不荒土地，保证今年谁种谁收。当地之地主与旧式富农，必须遵守政府法令，积极生产，如有破坏生产行为，政府定予严惩。指示规定各公营企业除保证完成贷种计划外，并作到稳定种价，避免高涨。
    【本报讯】太岳区党委顷发出春耕指示。根据全区土改整党情况，确定四月底以后全部转入大生产，发动全区农民为增产一成而努力。指示指出所有干部必须学会作生产工作，今年春耕中首先应注意解决群众的思想问题，宣传党的各种政策。根据气候、土质等各种条件尽可能的多生产工业原料。其次整顿和领导适合群众生产季节与需要的各种互助形式。三、解决烈军属及南征干部家属的生产困难。四、广泛吸收妇女参加农业劳动。五、解决农具耕畜等困难。六、在播种到来时，应根据行署规定，切实停止支差。领导上不能只作一般号召，必须深入群众具体领导，学习创造发展生产的经验。
    【本报讯】太行区行政公署于三月二十五日发出春耕指示，要求各地作到普上底肥，老区每亩增肥五担，半老区增三担，麦地争取普锄一次。修边垒堰，消灭平地熟荒二十万亩，修渠修井增加水田十五万亩，推广优良品种，注意防治虫害，切实完成播种计划。为此必须广泛宣传生产政策，发动群众热情，发展变工互助，组织买牲口，合作社注意解决生产工具与资料的困难。最后强调各领导干部必须亲自动手帮助群众完成生产计划。
    又，太行新华日报亦以“加紧开展春耕运动，奠定农业生产长一寸的基础”为题发表社论，号召各地深入宣传，克服春耕生产的一切思想障碍，并要具体帮助群众解决生产中的各种困难。社论指出不少干部把“领导”简单了解为“开会”“打通思想”，缺乏耐心细致的建设作风，这是领导不好生产的。社论最后指出今年农业生产中特别需要组织变工互助、建立供销合作社，以解决春耕的实际困难。关于新区春耕生产，社论指出首先应解决春荒，肃匪及其他工作，必须围绕生产进行。
