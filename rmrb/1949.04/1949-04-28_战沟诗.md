Trench poems are a concentrated expression of the joyful combat life of soldiers on the front lines.

The reporter visited the X × × and × × positions on the Xinxiang front and deeply felt the joy and interest of trench life. Many soldiers have rich and simple artistic talents. In the trenches, they built clubs, mess halls, bulletin boards, Q&A columns, and even turned each communication trench into a road, naming them something like "Road" or "Street." The families (cave dwellings) living on these roads were all assigned to a certain street (or road) with a house number. Each cave dwelling was named by the soldiers according to their preferences, and next to the cave, there were couplets written by the cave owner, such as No. 8 on "Firepower Street," which was named "Tiger Cave." The upper couplet read, "Go out of the cave and bite the enemy to death," and the lower couplet was paired with, "Defend the people of northern Henan." Outside the cave, a mud figure, more than a foot high, holding sorghum stalks was sculpted, with an explanation: "Henan People's Liberation Army, defend the people of northern Henan, you stand guard here, pay attention! Pay attention!" On "Laiyang Street," "Liberate Northern Henan Cave" wrote: "Revolutionary soldiers live in trenches, better than big western-style buildings in Xinxiang." This fully reflects the soldiers' joyful mood.

It was in this cheerful atmosphere that trench poems appeared!

Some of these poems were submitted to the bulletin board, and more were written and painted by the soldiers themselves on the neatly repaired edges of the communication trenches. Some were written with brushes, in red, yellow, blue, white, and black. Some were carved with bayonets in the earth's natural color, and even more were made of bullet casings, shining beautifully in the sun. At the outpost position on × × × × Road, some soldiers even scooped up unexploded chemical mortar shells from the enemy in the wheat field, poured out the yellow explosives inside, washed them with water, and wrote on the trench wall, looking like gold characters at a glance, appearing exceptionally beautiful.

These soldiers' works, which I jotted down at random, include:

(1) Three Laughs at the Enemy

First, we laugh at the enemy for firing mountain guns,
Our fortifications are well hidden,
The shots are really inaccurate,
　　Ineffective! Ineffective!

Second, we laugh at the enemy's counter-attack,
They charged many times without success,
The enemy comes out to charge again,
Incompetent! Incompetent!! Still incompetent!!!

Third, we laugh at the enemy's low morale,
They run away as soon as we attack,
Only regretting that their parents gave them short legs,
　　Run fast! Run fast!!

(2) He Doesn't Want a Receipt

Listen clearly, comrades,
The Xinxiang enemy is really cowardly,
Resting for three days, they are not convinced,
Carrying drums and looking for cudgels.
These attacks are even more sparse, (referring to March 17th)
Sending a large group of prisoners,
Corpses and wounded lined up,
And machine guns, rifles, small cannons,
Ammunition delivered completely.
Wanting to open a receipt,
He ran away with his tail between his legs.

(3) Sharpshooter

Listen clearly, comrades,
Zhao Ximing from the Third Company of Laiyang,
On the morning of March 12th,
Several enemies were heading south,
Ximing saw them and quickly aimed,
Shooting down the first one with one shot.
When the enemy saw things were not good,
They turned around and ran away.
One enemy risked danger,
Wanting to carry the corpse back,
Ximing did not hesitate when he saw it,
Sending another enemy to his death with one shot.
Comrades saw it clearly with their own eyes,
Praising Zhao Ximing in unison,
Truly a sharpshooter,
The top name is spread in the trenches.

(4) Fortifications

The People's Liberation Army digs in the ground,
Digging good fortifications, not afraid of artillery fire,
Fortifications are well dug,
The Xinxiang enemy cannot escape.
　×　×　×
Xinxiang enemy, don't run,
Fortifications are well dug on all sides,
If you want to sit in an airplane in the air,
I won't let you land.
　×　×　×
A road connecting Xinxiang,
Where heroic generals live and walk,
Dalu Zhuang frightens the enemy,
Shrinking their heads and waiting for death.
　×　×　×
Air raid shelter, well dug,
Not afraid of airplanes and artillery,
Strong and solid—
You also contribute to the liberation of Xinxiang.

(5) Machine Gun

Comrades, look inside,
A "three-section" heavy machine gun is inside,
If the enemy dares to invade,
I will destroy his bastards.
　×　×　×
"Breda" machine gun pointing down,
If the enemy comes, destroy them,
If you anger it, it will wail,
No matter how many of you (enemies) come, you can't escape.

(6) Hand Grenade

Hand grenade,
Egg-shaped,
If you dare to charge,
I will send you to "Fengdu City" (i.e., the underworld)

(7) Small Iron Shovel

Small iron shovel, black and shiny,
The fortifications dug are strong and sturdy,
If the enemy shoots, we drill in,
Ensuring that we are not injured.

(8) How to Earn Merits?

Sweat more, bleed less,
The task must be completed resolutely,
Attack fiercely and charge fiercely,
Capture prisoners to make great achievements.

In addition, there are many others about discussing the situation, emphasizing hygiene, paying attention to discipline, controlling the airport, learning from the Northeast elder brothers, etc. These all demonstrate the soldiers' creative talents in combat life.

### 战沟诗

　　战沟诗
    史  洪
    战沟诗的出现，是前线兵士一种愉快的战斗生活的集中表现。
    记者曾游历新乡前线×××和××的两大阵地，深感战沟生活的愉快而有趣。许多战士是有很丰富的朴素的艺术，战沟里他们建设了俱乐部、饭堂、门板报、问答栏，还把每条交通沟修成马路，起名什么路或什么街，在这些路上住的人家（窑洞），都编了什么街（或路），门牌多少号，每个窑洞战士们依自己的喜爱起了名字，在洞边还有洞主人自编自写的对联，如××一条名为“火力街”的门牌八号就起名“猛虎洞”，上联写的“出洞咬死敌人”，下联则配以“保卫豫北人民”，洞外捏了一个一尺多高持着秫秸的泥人，一边加了说明：“豫北人民解放军，保卫豫北人民，你在这里站岗，注意！注意！”在“莱阳大街”一个“解放豫北洞”上则写了：“革命军人住战沟，赛过新乡大洋楼”。这充分的体现了战士们的愉快心情。
    就在这种欢快的情绪下，战沟诗出现了！
    这些诗，一部分是投给门板报的，更多的则是战士们亲手写画在他们修理得很整齐的交通沟边，有的是用毛笔写成的，红黄蓝白黑各色都有，有的是用刺刀加以雕刻的土本色，更有的用子弹壳砌成，迎着太阳发着美丽的金光。在××××路前哨阵地上还有的战士在麦田里，掬回敌人没有爆炸的化学迫击炮弹，把里面的黄色炸药倒出，用水冲起来，写在沟墙上，一眼望去都象是金字，显得异常美丽。
    这些战士的作品，就我随手抄到的有：
    （一）三笑敌人
    一笑敌人放山炮，
    咱们工事隐蔽好，
    打的没准真无效，
      无效！无效！
    二笑敌人反冲锋，
    冲了数次也不中，
    敌人出来再冲锋，
    无能！无能！！还无能！！！
    三笑敌人士气小，
    我们一打就跑了，
    只恨爹娘生腿短，
      紧跑！紧跑！！
　
　　（二）他不要收条
　
    列位同志听分明，
    新乡敌人真孬种，
    休息三天不服气，
    背上大鼓找棒捶。
    这些进攻更稀松，（指三月十七日）
    送来俘虏一大群，
    死尸伤员排成队，
    还有机枪、步枪、小炮、
    子弹样样送齐备。
    有心开个收到条，
    他夹着尾巴一直跑。
　　（三）神枪手
　
    诸位同志你听清，
    莱阳三连赵希明，
    三月十二清晨起，
    几个敌人往南行，
    希明看见忙瞄准，
    一枪打倒第一名。
    敌人一看事不好，
    扭回头来就逃跑。
    一个敌人来撞险，
    要把死尸搬回程，
    希明一见不待慢，
    一枪又送敌性命。
    同志亲眼看的准，
    齐声称赞赵希明，
    真是一个神枪手，
    战壕里边传头名。
　
　　（四）工事
　
    解放军，地里挖，
    挖好工事不怕炮来打，
    工事挖的好，
    新乡敌人跑不了。
  　×　×　×
    新乡敌人你别跑，
    四面工事挖的好，
    你要空中坐飞机，
    我就不准你落地。
  　×　×　×
    一条道沟通新乡，
    住的走的英雄将，
    路庄打得敌丧胆，
    缩头不出等死亡。
  　×　×　×
    防空洞，挖的好，
    不怕飞机和大炮，
    坚又牢——
    解放新乡你也有功劳。
　
　　（五）机枪
　
    同志们，往里看，
    “三节式”重机在里面，
    要是敌人敢进犯，
    我就消灭它王八蛋。
  　×　×　×
    “白达林”机枪梭朝下，
    敌人来了消灭它，
    惹怒它了哇哇叫，
    你（敌人）来的多少都跑
    不了。
　
　　（六）手溜弹
　
    手榴弹，
    鸡蛋形，
    你要敢来冲，
    保送你到“酆都城”（即冥国）
　
　　（七）小铁铣
　
    小铁铣，黑又亮，
    挖的工事坚又强，
    敌人打炮钻进去，
    保险自己不伤亡。
　
　　（八）怎样立战功？
　
    多流汗，少流血，
    任务完成要坚决，
    猛打又猛冲，
    捉住俘虏立大功。
    除此，谈形势，讲卫生，注意纪律，控制飞机场，学习东北老大哥等还有好多。这些都表现了战士在战斗生活中的创造才能。
