    Organize Housewives to Participate in Various Productive Labors
    --Opinions on the Huang Piao Issue and Transforming Consumer Cities into Productive Cities.
    Editor:
    An unstoppable force compels me to write this letter to you. I am a high school student, graduated two years before the "July 7th Incident." Later, because I got married, had children, and lost my job, I have been living a parasitic life at home. The liberation of Peiping, like a thunderclap in spring, awakened even a small insect like me, lurking in a dark corner. Although I have been indifferent to social affairs, I also feel that this time is different from the changes of dynasties in the past by warlords, Japanese devils, and Kuomintang. I often go to the streets to read newspapers. When I saw the "Decision on the Current Tasks of the Women's Movement in Peiping City" by the Peiping Municipal Women's Committee, and the editorial "Transforming Consumer Cities into Productive Cities," as well as Ms. Huang Piao's recent appeal and everyone's enthusiastic support for her, I was excited as I haven't been in decades, and the vitality of life returned to me. I painfully felt that, like Ms. Huang Piao, there were thousands upon thousands of young sisters who enthusiastically pursued progress but were groaning and struggling under feudal oppression in the old society, and many eventually ruined their youth and future. Even someone like me, who was fortunate enough to have an opportunity to study, was ultimately rejected and excluded by the old society, returned to the kitchen, and became increasingly depressed and numb, wasn't I? At that time, no matter how many sisters there were like this, who could they turn to for help, and even if they spoke out, they would only be ridiculed, who would be willing to give you a helping hand? But today is different, the Communist Party cares about and helps all the oppressed people. If you don't rise up and seek liberation, you are truly willing to degenerate. I myself think this way, whether it is someone like Ms. Huang Piao or someone like me, there is only one way to liberate ourselves: participate in productive independent work. Otherwise, how can we break through this feudal bondage? How can we talk about "equality between men and women" if we cannot work independently? How can we seek progress? If some sisters want to liberate themselves but are afraid of labor, that is not right. At the same time, they should no longer be ambitious and afraid of doing specific work. I myself have lived a parasitic life for more than a decade and have degenerated into a person with no skills, but I can still learn one or two productive skills, or do some specific work. Whether it is sewing, being a childcare worker, or learning to type, etc., I am willing to learn and willing to do. At the same time, I also hope that the comrades working in various street districts can pay attention to organizing housewives like us to engage in labor and production, such as setting up small cooperatives, small handicrafts, etc., or training us to do some specific work. The newspaper is discussing how to turn consumer cities into productive cities. I think that there are many women like me in Peiping. This is a large group of consumers who do not engage in production. Women account for half of the population. Organizing them to participate in labor not only enables women to get rid of their shameful parasitic lives, but also makes it a contribution that women should make in the process of turning Peiping into a productive city. I don't know if my opinion is right?

### 组织家庭知识妇女参加各种生产劳动——对黄飘问题和变消费城市为生产城市的意见。

　　组织家庭知识妇女参加各种生产劳动
    ——对黄飘问题和变消费城市为生产城市的意见。编辑同志：
    一股不可遏止的力量迫使我不能不给你写这封信。我是一个高中学生，“七七”事变前两年毕业的。后来因为结婚后生了孩子，又失了业，一直在家庭过着寄生虫的生活。北平的解放，象一声春雷，把我这垫伏在阴暗的角落里的小虫也惊醒了。尽管我对社会上的事情漠不关心，可是也感觉到这一次和过去军阀、日本鬼、国民党们你来我去的改朝换代不同。我上街经常去看看报，当看到北平市妇委“关于北平市妇女运动当前任务的决定”，和“把消费城市变成生产城市”的社论，以及最近黄飘女士的呼声和大家对她的热情的支援后，十几年来从未有过的兴奋激动着我，生命的活力重新回到我身上。我痛感到：象黄飘女士那样热情追求进步的年轻姊妹，在旧社会里有千千万万在封建压迫下呻吟挣扎，但不少的人终于葬送了自己的青春和前途。即使象我这样，幸而能有个求学机会，但终归还不是被旧社会摈弃排斥，回到厨房，而日益消沉麻木了吗？那时候纵然这样的姊妹有多少，但有苦向谁去诉，说出来也不过遭人嘲笑而已，有谁肯助你一把力？今天可是不同了，共产党关心并帮助所有被压迫的人，再不起来自求解放，那可真是自甘堕落了。我自己这样想，不管是黄飘女士那样的，或是我这样的，要想解放都只有一条路：参加生产独立工作。不然怎样冲破这种封建束缚？不能独立工作怎样能谈“男女平等”？怎样能求进步？假使有的姊妹们想解放又怕劳动那就不对了。同时也不应再好高鹜远，怕做具体工作。我自己过了十几年的寄生生活，已经退化成一无所长的人，但要学习一两样生产技能，或者做一点具体工作还是可以的，不论是缝纫做保育员学打字等等我都愿意学愿意做。同时还希望在各街区工作的同志，能注意组织我们这样的家庭妇女从事劳动生产，比如搞些小合作社，小手工业等，或者训练我们做一点具体工作。报纸上讨论如何把消费城市变成生产城市，我想到，北平象我这样的女人还多得很，这是一大批不事生产的消费者。妇女占人口的一半，把她们组织起来参加劳动，不仅使妇女能摆脱可耻的寄生生活，同时也是妇女在把北平变成生产城市的过程中应尽的一份力量，不知我这意见对不对？
