　　Brief Replies
    To a postal agency in Beiping:
    The commission given to postal agencies by the post office is determined by the amount of stamps sold each month. According to a telephone reply from the Municipal Post Office: the commission is limited to no more than ten percent.
    To Tang Baishi: Your son, Tang Yiru, has indeed joined the People's Liberation Army. The reason that the district government notified others to register but not you may be that the district government was unaware of this situation. You can go to the district government to explain the situation and register.
　　To Mr. Yi Junshi: Your brother participated in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Public School and the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University during the Anti-Japanese War. It has been ten years since you last heard from him. Because you do not know his work address or unit number, it is impossible to inquire. To Mr. Li Muqing of Tianjin: Your suggestions for preventing theft from train passengers have been forwarded to the Pingjin Railway Bureau Office.
    To Mr. Wen Duo: Please provide a detailed mailing address so that we can reply to your questions by letter.
    To Mr. Jia Yun: The question you raised cannot be answered in just a few words. Please come to our office (2:00 PM to 5:00 PM daily) for a discussion.
