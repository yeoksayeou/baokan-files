Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 25th.

　　Taiyuan is the capital of Shanxi Province, one of North China's heavy industrial bases, and a well-known industrial city in the country. It was the old nest of the pro-Japanese traitor, war criminal of the civil war, and famous Chinese warlord, Yan Xishan, who ruled for nearly forty years. The population is about 400,000. Taiyuan's suburbs are rich in mineral resources, with iron in the eastern mountains and coal in the western mountains, which can meet industrial needs. Factories are lined up in the four suburbs, especially the arsenal, steel plant, coal mine, cement plant, Northwest Chemical Plant, etc. Light industry includes paper mills, woolen mills, cotton mills, match factories, flour mills, leather factories, printing factories, and lumber factories, all of which are quite large in scale. Culture and education are also very developed. There are Shanxi University, the Academy of Natural Sciences, and dozens of secondary schools. Taiyuan is located in the central part of Shanxi Province, with a strategic location. It has been a battleground for strategists since ancient times. During the Japanese occupation, it built strong fortifications as an important strategic base for invading North China. After Yan inherited the legacy of the Japanese invaders, he greatly expanded the fortifications. There were three defense lines built outside Taiyuan city alone, with no less than 3,000 steel-concrete and brick bunkers, including 685 main bunkers. Four airports were built on the south, north, and east sides of the city wall. The Wusu South Airport and the Xincheng North Airport can accommodate giant aircraft. After Yan was besieged in Taiyuan, he used this as the only transportation line to obtain foreign aid. After the People's Liberation Army launched the Jinzhong Campaign in June and July last year, it eliminated the important strongholds in the outer areas of Taiyuan. In October, the PLA launched another offensive, approaching the suburbs, and Taiyuan was surrounded. After the Huaihai and Pingjin Campaigns, Yan Xishan, fearing that he would be captured alive when Taiyuan was liberated, fled to Nanjing alone in February. Before this attack, in order to spare the hundreds of thousands of people in Taiyuan from the ravages of war, the Taiyuan Front Command of the People's Liberation Army repeatedly advised the defending enemy to lay down their weapons voluntarily, but they were all rejected by Yan's bandit army. The bandit leader, Liang Huazhi, and others set fire and poison, destroying assets. The People's Liberation Army completely cleared the outer fortress strongholds from the 20th to the 22nd, and launched a general attack on the city walls on the morning of the 24th. After only five hours of fighting, the entire defending enemy was annihilated, ending the inhumane feudal fascist rule of the Yan bandit group. After the liberation of Taiyuan, the city's industry will have the conditions for full development, and it will play an important role in the People's Liberation War in North China and the national construction cause.

　　太原介绍
    太原为山西省会，华北的重工业基地之一，也是全国有数的工业城市，是亲日汉奸、内战战犯、中国有名的军阀阎锡山统治近四十年的老巢。人口约四十万左右。太原城郊矿产丰富，东山之铁，西山之煤，可供工业需要。四郊工厂林立，尤以兵工厂、炼钢厂、煤矿、洋灰厂、西北化学厂等为著名。轻工业有造纸厂、毛织厂、棉织厂、火柴厂、面粉厂、皮革厂、印刷厂、木料厂等，规模都相当宏大。文化教育亦很发达。有山西大学，自然科学院及中等学校数十所。太原位于山西省中部，形势险要，自古为兵家必争之地，日寇侵占时期，曾修筑强固工事，作为侵略华北的重要战略基地。阎贼继承日寇遗产后又大事增修，仅太原城外就筑有三道防线，钢骨水泥与砖碉不下三千座，其中主碉就有六百八十五个。城垣南、北、东三面筑有四个飞机场，武宿南机场与新城北机场可落巨型飞机，阎贼在太原被围后曾借此作为取得外援的唯一运输线。去年六七月间人民解放军发动晋中战役后，即扫除太原外围地区各重要据点。十月，解放军再度发动攻势，逼近城郊，太原就陷入重围。淮海、平津战役后，阎匪锡山害怕太原解放时被活捉，就在二月间只身逃亡南京。此次进攻前，为使太原数十万人民免于战祸，解放军太原前线司令部曾多次劝告守敌自动放下武器，但均遭阎匪军拒绝。匪首梁化之等并大肆纵火放毒，破坏资产。解放军乃于二十日至二十二日完全肃清城外要塞据点，二十四日晨向城垣发动总攻，仅经五小时战斗，即将守敌全部歼灭，结束了阎匪集团的惨无人道的封建法西斯统治。太原解放后，该城工业将从此获得充分发展的条件，对于人民解放战争自华北及全国建设事业，都将起重要作用。
