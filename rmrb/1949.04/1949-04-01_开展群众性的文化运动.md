　　Launching a Mass Cultural Movement
    In the rural areas of the liberated zones after land reform, there is a need to widely launch a mass cultural movement. After acquiring sufficient means of production, farmers strongly demand cultural emancipation and are closely concerned about the Party's current policies, requiring to maintain political contact with the Party at all times in order to "follow the path of the Communist Party." Therefore, during this period, schools have greatly developed, newspapers are unprecedentedly close to the masses, various literacy schools are established everywhere, and the rural drama movement has widely developed. This vigorous and diverse rural cultural activity is one of the achievements of the victory of land reform. We should combine the demands and enthusiasm of the masses to give correct leadership, so that these cultural activities are more popular and improved, and truly become an important part of the daily life of the masses. The instructions of the Taihang Administrative Office on organizing rural clubs are a good measure. This will provide systematic leadership, which is very necessary. In addition, we believe that the content should be closely integrated with the mass production movement, explaining the Party's production policies, exchanging production technologies, and learning scientific and health knowledge. The steps should not be to demand universal establishment all at once, but to select villages with better conditions to conduct pilot projects first, create experience, and gradually promote them. The rural Party branches should strengthen leadership in a planned way to prevent them from becoming a mere formality. All localities should attach great importance to this work. Do not think that a call can organize it all at once, but carefully select and compile propaganda content, strengthen the ideological leadership of cultural and educational workers, and create diverse forms to meet the needs of the masses. Only in this way can we greatly strengthen the mass ideological education in all land reform completed areas, improve the class consciousness of the peasants, and ensure that agricultural production is improved from the existing foundation.

　　开展群众性的文化运动
    在土地改革后的解放区农村，需要广泛的兴起一个群众性的文化运动。农民在取得了足够的生产资料之后，强烈要求文化翻身，密切地关切着我党当前各种政策，要求时时在政治上保持着与党的联系，以便“跟上共产党的道路走”。所以在这一时期，学校大发展，报纸同群众空前的密切，各种补习学校到处设立，农村剧运广泛发展，这种蓬勃多样的农村文化活动，是土地改革胜利成就之一。我们应该结合群众的要求和热情予以正确的领导，使这些文化活动更加普及和提高，并真正成为群众日常生活的重要部份。太行行署组织农村俱乐部的指示是一个好的措施。这样便会有系统的领导，这是非常必要的。此外，我们认为在内容上应紧密结合大生产运动，讲解党的生产政策，交流生产技术，学习科学卫生常识。进行的步骤不要一下子便要求普遍设立，而应选择条件较好村庄先行试办，创造经验，逐渐推广，农村党的支部应当有计划地加强领导，勿使其流于形式。各地都应十分重视这一工作。决不要以为发一个号召便可以一下子组织起来，而要认真选择编制宣传内容，加强文化教育工作者的思想领导，创造多样的适应群众要求的形式。只有这样，才会大大加强一切土地改革完成地区的群众思想教育工作，提高农民的阶级觉悟，保证农业生产从现有基础上提高一步。
