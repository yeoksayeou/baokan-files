Implementing Labor-Capital Cooperation Promotes Rapid Production Development

Private Da Hua Kiln Company Conducts Democratic Wage Assessment

[This newspaper's exclusive interview] This newspaper reported recently (April 25th) that the private Da Hua Kiln Company has experienced rapid production development due to the implementation of a labor-capital cooperation policy. Now, both labor and capital sides of the company have elected a wage assessment committee on the 22nd of this month to conduct democratic wage assessment. After five days of deliberation and discussion, the assessment has now been completed, and April's wages have been distributed according to the new regulations the other day (April 26th), which employees are generally satisfied with. The factory's assessment committee is composed of assessment members elected by the production unit workers, together with the foremen of each unit and the factory manager, totaling 42 members. The assessment committee first announced that the wage assessment and adjustment aimed to make wages more reasonable, based on technical skill, labor capacity, and level of responsibility, to determine wage levels. The assessment committee proposed a plan with five grades and nineteen levels. Each production unit group studied the specific situation, encouraged workers to express their opinions, and after five days of repeated comparisons and continuous revisions through three assessment committee meetings and two group meetings, the assessment committee finally determined three types of workers: technical workers, skilled workers, and apprentice workers, with four grades and ten levels, from the lowest fifth grade, eighteenth level, to the highest wage of second grade, seventh level. Levels nineteen, twelve, and six and above are left vacant, in preparation for advancement after technical improvement. It was determined that Chang Jianzhang and six others would be at the fifth grade, eighteenth level, with a daily wage of four jin and one liang of rice per person (food and lodging provided – same below); Xing Fenglin and twenty-four others would be at the fifth grade, seventeenth level, with a daily wage of four jin and three liang of rice per person; Ma Jiankui and twenty-three others would be at the fifth grade, sixteenth level, with a daily wage of four jin and five liang of rice per person (above are apprentice workers); Wu Wenliang and twelve others would be at the fourth grade, fifteenth level, with a daily wage of four jin and fifteen liang of rice per person; Zhang Wen and twenty others would be at the fourth grade, fourteenth level, with a daily wage of five jin and two liang of rice per person; Liu Fengyu and twenty-five others would be at the fourth grade, thirteenth level, with a daily wage of five jin and five liang of rice per person (above are skilled workers); Yang Wenmin and seven others would be at the third grade, eleventh level, with a daily wage of six jin and seven liang of rice per person; Qi Longkui and three others would be at the third grade, tenth level, with a daily wage of six jin and ten liang of rice per person; Jin Yuxiang and seventeen others would be at the third grade, ninth level, with a daily wage of six jin and thirteen liang of rice per person; Ma Fuqin and eleven others would be at the third grade, eighth level, with a daily wage of seven jin of rice per person; Zhang Xiucheng and eight others would be at the second grade, seventh level, with a daily wage of seven jin and a half of rice per person (above are technical workers). This wage regulation is calculated based on a ten-hour workday. One hour of overtime is converted into one ordinary hour for wage payment. In addition, the manager's original salary of 250 jin per month has been increased to 500 jin; the engineer's original salary of 500 jin per month has been increased to 600 jin; the foreman now receives 300 jin per month; the salaries of the 14 staff members now range from 160 jin to 250 jin per month; and the wages of other long-term workers, barbers, etc., range from 80 jin to 220 jin per month. According to the factory's wages before the adjustment, the lowest daily wage was three and a half jin of rice per person, which has now been increased to four jin and one liang; the highest was originally five and a half jin of rice, which has now been increased to seven and a half jin. There has been no decrease, but an overall increase, and the gap between the highest and lowest wages has been widened through this general increase. Based on the current situation, the lowest wage is not considered low; however, the difference between the wages of technical workers and the lowest wage of apprentice workers is still less than double. Of course, it cannot yet be said that a cross-progressive wage system has been implemented, but a step has been taken in this direction, and for the time being, this is all that can be achieved. Some people have reflected that the assessment of individual workers' wages is not completely fair, and if this is the case, the factory's management committee needs to make individual adjustments in the future. This factory's experience in wage assessment proves that a guided democratic assessment method can be implemented in private enterprises to solve wage problems.

　　实行劳资两利生产迅速发展
  　私营大华窑业公司进行民主评定工资
    【本报专访】本报曾于日前（二十五日）报导私营大华窑业公司由于实行了劳资两利政策，生产得到迅速发展，现该公司劳资双方，又在本月二十二日推选出评资委员会，进行民主评定工资。经过五天的酝酿讨论，现已评议完竣，四月份工资并已按新的规定于日前（二十六日）发下，职工一般都很满意。该厂评议委员会，系由生产单位工人推出的评议委员，会同各该单位的工务长、该厂经理共同组织而成，共有委员四十二人。评委会首先即宣布评议调整工资，是为了使工资更加合理，是依据技术高低，劳动能力，责任大小，来规定工资的高低。评委会提出了五等十九级的方案，各生产单位小组根据具体情况研究，启发工人提意见，先后五天经过三次评委会、两次小组会反复比较不断修正，最后由评委会确定为技术工、熟练工、学习工三种，四等十级，自最低五等、十八级起，至最高工资为二等、七级，等级之间空出十九级、十二级、六级以上各级，以准备技术提高后的进级。计确定常建章等七人为五等、十八级，每人每日工资米四斤一两（供给食宿——下同），邢风林等二十四人为五等、十七级，每人每日工资米为四斤三两，马建魁等二十三人为五等、十六级，每人每日工资米为四斤五两（以上为学习工），吴文良等十二人为四等、十五级，每人每日工资米为四斤十五两，张文等二十人为四等、十四级，每人每日工资米为五斤二两，刘凤玉等二十五人为四等、十三级，每人每日工资米为五斤五两（以上为熟练工），杨文敏等七人为三等、十一级，每人每日工资米为六斤七两，齐龙魁等三人为三等、十级，每人每日工资米为六斤十两，金玉祥等十七人为三等、九级，每人每日工资米为六斤十三两，马福钦等十一人为三等、八级，每人每日工资米为七斤，张秀成等八人为二等、七级，每人每日工资米为七斤半（以上为技术工）。此次工资规定，是以每日十小时工作计算，加点一小时，折普通一小时就发工资。除此外，经理每月原为二百五十斤，现增至五百斤，工程师原为每月五百斤，现增至六百斤，工务长现每月三百斤，职员十四人现每月薪资由一百六十斤起至二百五十斤止，其他外长工、理发工等每人每月工资由八十斤至二百二十斤不等。按该厂调整前的工资，每人每日最低者为三斤半米，现提高到四斤一两；最高者原为五斤半米，现提高到七斤半。没有下降的，是平均上升的现象，从普遍上升中来拉长最高工资与最低工资的差额。依据现在情况，最低工资已不算少；但技术工的工资与学习工的最低工资差额还不到一倍。当然还不能说是实行了交叉累进工资制，但已朝着这个方向进了一步，并且暂时也只能作到这样。有人反映，此次评资中，对个别工人工资的评定，尚有不完全公允之处，如系事实，是需要该厂厂务管理委员会在今后加以个别调整的。次次该厂评议工资的经验证明：在私人企业中也可以实行有领导的民主评议的办法来解决工资问题。
