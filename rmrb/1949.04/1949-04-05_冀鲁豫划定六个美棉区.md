[Ji-Lu-Yu Electric] The Agricultural Department of the Ji-Lu-Yu Administrative Office recently designated six American cotton improved seed management zones, totaling over 33,000 mu, planning to sow 100,000 jin of 2B type Si Zi cotton seeds. Specifically, Qingfeng and Guancheng will each receive 20,000 jin, Liaocheng 25,000 jin, Huaxian and Yuncheng each 10,000 jin, and the Administrative Office's farm 15,000 jin. These will be loaned to the masses to encourage planting. To prevent the cotton seeds from becoming mixed, within a ten-li radius of the improved seed zones, the masses will be persuaded not to plant other mixed cotton varieties. On the 25th of last month, the Agricultural Department dispatched personnel to Linqing to transport the cotton seeds, which will soon be directly distributed to the various improved seed zones for planting.
