　　Beijing Workers Support Miner Brothers
  　Unanimously Protest the Kailuan Massacre
    The Era When Capitalists Treated Workers as Less Than Human is Over
    [Our Newspaper] After the news of the successive tragedies at the Kailuan Coal Mine in Tangshan reached Beijing, all the workers in Beijing's factories expressed extreme indignation and lodged protests one after another.
    At the 70th Ordnance Factory, the news was written on the blackboard newspaper. Workers flocked to find newspapers, and some study groups immediately held discussions. They said, "The four demands are the most basic conditions, and the capitalists must fulfill them!" Worker Fan Zhiquan said angrily, "We workers have overcome all difficulties and restored and developed production. Why do capitalists still want to mistreat us? We can no longer tolerate this oppression. We, all the workers, first mourn the dead and extend our condolences to the injured. We demand that capitalists quickly improve all safety equipment and properly treat the injured workers." Worker Fan Zhiquan proposed, "We demand that the North China People's Government send someone to the mine to thoroughly investigate this matter." Wang Lezhai said, "Imperialists have always treated our working class with arrogance and cruelty. Now, our people have the strength to deal with them."
    When the workers of the Beijing No. 2 Clothing Factory were electing trade union committee members, the unfortunate news came. All the more than 800 workers quarreled. The male workers shouted and cursed, and some female workers couldn't help crying. As soon as the news was read, the workers surrounded the reader. Jin Yunzhen, a female worker from the sewing department, said with tears in her eyes, "They are deliberately harming us workers. I must avenge my dead brothers." Qi Gang and Xu Baozhen, workers from the second and third shifts of the department, said, "They still dare to be so bold. If they don't change their previous attitude, the working class will show its strength."
    Wang Shiyuan, a worker at the Jibei Electric Power Company, said, "The factories and mines run by imperialists in China, where Chinese workers work, are simply selling their lives to them."
    All the workers of the Tongzhou Power Plant of the Tram Company were very angry when they heard the news by telephone and automatically gathered together to discuss the Kailuan incident. More than 4,000 workers of the People's Printing Factory gathered automatically at the trade union to discuss the Kailuan incident. They decided that, in addition to strongly supporting the thorough implementation of the four conditions put forward by the Kailuan miners, they would also add a condition that the capitalists should be responsible for taking care of the lives of the families of the dead and injured workers forever and treat the injured well. All the workers expressed a serious protest to the Kailuan capitalists. They said, "The working class today is not what it used to be. We have strong arms, we have the strong leadership of the Communist Party. The era when capitalists treated us workers as less than human is over."

　　平市职工声援矿工兄弟
  　一致抗议开滦惨案
    资本家拿工人不当人看的时代已经过去了
    【本报讯】唐山开滦煤矿连续发生惨案消息传至北平市以后，北平市各厂的全体职工表现了极度的愤慨，纷纷提出抗议。
    七十兵工厂，将此消息写到黑板报上，工人们纷纷找报纸，有的学习小组马上开会讨论，他们说：“四个要求是最起码的条件，资本家非办到不行！”工人范之权气虎虎地说：“我们工人克服了一切困难，恢复发展了生产，资本家为什么还要虐待我们呢？我们再也不能忍受这种压迫了，我们全体工人先向死者哀悼，向受伤者慰问，要资本家赶快改善一切安全设备，急速将受伤的工人妥为医治。”工人范之权提出：“要求华北人民政府派专人前往该矿将此问题彻底查明。”王乐斋说：“帝国主义者历来对待我们工人阶级是骄横残忍的，现在，我们人民自己是有力量对付他”。
    北平市被服二场工人正在选举工会委员的时候，不幸的消息传来，全体八百多工人都吵起来了，男工友大声叫骂，有些女工禁不住哭了，消息刚读完，工人们都围到读报人面前去了，缝纫部女工金云珍带着满脸泪水说：“他们诚心谋害我们工人，我一定要为死去的弟兄们报仇。”该部二、三班工人齐刚、徐宝珍说：“现在他们还竟敢如此大胆，不改变以前的态度，工人阶级会表示自己力量的。”
    冀北电力公司工人王世元说：“帝国主义在中国办的工矿，中国工人作工，简直就是把性命卖给了他们。”
    电车公司通州发电厂全体工人从电话听到此消息，都非常生气，自动集合到一块讨论开滦事件。人民印刷厂四千多工人，纷纷自动的集合到工会去讨论开滦事件，他们决定除大力支持开滦矿工所提出之四个条件彻底实现以外，并提出要增加一个条件，资本家应永远负责照顾死亡和负伤职工的家属的生活。并将伤员好好医治。全体工人都表示对开滦资本家提出严重抗议，他们说：“现在的工人阶级可不是过去了，我们有了坚强的武装，有了坚强的共产党的领导，资本家拿我们工人不当人看待的时代已经过去了。”
