People's Cadre
  Hao Yongsheng Refuses Temptation Three Times
    As soon as the comrades of the Third District work team arrived at the Eighth Bao, the former pseudo-Bao chief wanted them to go to his house for dinner, saying that he had white flour, a stove, and servants, which was very convenient. At that time, team leader Comrade Hao Yongsheng politely declined him. Later, after inquiring, they learned that this Bao chief was hired by a certain pharmacy with money.
    After a few days, Comrade Hao happened to pass by a barbershop with the pseudo-Bao chief, and he babbled to Comrade Hao: "You are too tired, always busy, and you don't even have time to get a haircut, and the allowances are too small..." He wanted to invite Hao to get a haircut and eat in a restaurant. Comrade Hao immediately put on a stern face and refused him. The Bao chief walked away with a smirk.
    Later, after the former pseudo-Bao chiefs took an oath of determination to serve the people, he ran into Comrade Hao and pulled Hao to drink across the street with a smile, saying: "After being busy for so many days, it's finally the end of a stage of work, and it's time to enjoy it." Comrade Hao said sternly, "Why do you keep talking about this?" The other party dared not mention it again.

　　人民的干部
  　郝勇生三次拒诱
    三区工作组的同志们一到八保，前伪保长就要他们到他家里去吃饭，说他家里有白面有炉火，又有差役，什么都方便。当时组长郝勇生同志即婉言谢绝了他。后来一打听，才知道这个保长是×××药号拿钱雇的。
    过了些日子，郝同志偶然又与该伪保长经过理发店，他又罗罗嗦嗦对郝同志说：“你们太辛苦了，整天忙，头发也没工夫剃，津贴又少……”要请郝去理发、吃馆子。郝同志立即放下脸严词拒绝了他，该保长嘻皮笑脸地走了。
    后来在前伪保长们具结决心为人民服务的宣誓仪式后他碰上了郝同志，又满面笑容的拉郝去对门喝酒；说：“忙了这么些日子，好容易工作告一个段落，也该享受享受了。”郝同志正色说：“你怎么老谈这个？”对方就再不敢提了。
