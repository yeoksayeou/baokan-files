　　Family is Landlord Class
　　Those Who Sell Labor for a Full Year are Considered Workers
　　To the Editor,

　　I live in a rural village. My family owns more than 1 qing of land. The whole family does not work, but hires two farmhands and rents out more than 30 mu of land, relying on exploitation for a living. I ran away from home because I was dissatisfied with my marriage and joined an iron factory as a worker, and have been there for more than three years. Before the liberation of Beiping, I heard rumors that anyone who had lived off exploitation would be liquidated and struggled against. At that time, I thought, "Beiping must not be liberated." Now it has been liberated for several months, but I haven't heard any news about me being liquidated. Comrades are very kind to me, but I am always timid in my heart. What should be done about my situation? Please answer.

　　Mr. Zhu Yiling:

　　Based on the information you provided, and according to the 1933 document and Comrade Ren Bishi's report, the answer is as follows: The document states: Landlords or rich peasants whose family members have sold labor for a full year before liberation should be recognized as workers, and they and their wives should be treated as workers. Other family members should still be landlords or rich peasants and should not enjoy workers' rights. So, your timidity is unnecessary.

### 家庭是地主成份　本人出卖劳力满一年者即算工人

　　家庭是地主成份
  　本人出卖劳力满一年者即算工人
    编辑同志
    我家居乡村，家有一顷多地，全家不劳动，雇有二个雇工，出租三十多亩地，依靠剥削生活。我因对婚姻不满，逃出家庭，参加到一个铁工厂当工人，已有三年多了。北平未解放前，听人传说，只要吃过剥削饭的，一律被清算斗争，那时我心想，北平可别解放。现在已解放数月，但也听不到我被清算的消息，同志们见了我都很和气，我心里老是胆虚，象我这个情形，该如何处理，求您解答。
    　　　　　朱易岭易岭先生：
    根据你所谈情况，依据一九三三年文件，及任弼时同志报告，答复如下：在文件中说：地主或富农家中，在解放前出卖劳动力已满一年者，应承认其为工人成份，本人及其妻子照工人待遇。家中其他人应仍为地主或富农，不得享受工人权利。所以你这种胆虚是不必要的。
