　　Destroying the Lies of Wall Street
  　To Ensure Peace
    Richard Boyer
    At the literature group meeting, American writer Richard Boyer gave a moving speech on the responsibility of writers in the struggle for peace. He said: Unless we destroy the various lies that permeate all aspects of American life, we cannot ensure peace. One such lie is that those who advocate peace are traitors, while those who plan wars are patriots. According to this lie, it is said that the Soviet Union's suggestion of disarmament is a step towards war, while the United States approving a twenty billion dollar budget to manufacture weapons of mass destruction is for peace. Boyer urged American writers to expose these lies spread by Wall Street warmongers. The audience responded with warm applause to the speech by Soviet writer and Stalin Prize winner Pavlenko.
    Soviet Writer Pavlenko: The air that humanity breathes today is filled with the ideal of cooperation through the labor of the people
    Pavlenko said that since the time of Pushkin, Soviet literature has always stood on the side of progress. During the thirty-one years of the Soviet state's existence, our literature, publishing, journalism, and our theater and film have greatly enriched our noble traditions, which are filled with the ideal of peaceful cooperation among nations. Pavlenko continued: However, if we peruse the newspapers or magazines published in certain countries, we find that reactionary forces are spreading a large amount of absurd, spiritually depraved war propaganda, corrupting the minds of millions of readers. In Germany, Italy, and Japan, the shattered forces of fascism are regrouping, donning new disguises, and preparing new disasters for humanity. At such a time, all those who consider themselves defenders of peaceful cooperation among nations can no longer remain silent or act as indifferent bystanders. Writers are the engineers, shapers, and designers of the human soul. We have the power to shape and nurture our future generations with the worldview that we believe is most beneficial for the future. If everyone works together and determines common goals and tasks, nothing can stop us. The air that humanity breathes today is filled with the ideal of cooperation through the labor of the people. Pavlenko emphasized: We must never lose faith in peace, because that means losing the will to defend peace. The people of all countries do not want to raise their children only to have them sacrificed for the interests of crazy politicians like Hitler and his henchmen, who can be found in capitalist countries. Children must grow up to live, not to die. We must teach the younger generation that taking up arms to attack one's neighbors is as criminal as theft or rape. We will achieve victory, we will defeat the plague of war, and we will extinguish the aggressive ideas that are spreading as rapidly as a plague. The famous American writer Albert Kahn said: "For thirty years, we have been repeatedly told that the Soviet Union wants to overthrow the governments of other countries in the world. The opposite has proven to be true. For thirty years, other governments, including the United States government, have been deliberately trying to destroy the Soviet Union." He believes that he is grateful to the Soviet Union, not only for its role in the anti-fascist war, but also for leading the struggle to defend peace. The female writer Smottlei advised writers to serve the cause of the people and peace with their talents. She said: "Let us not forget that if millions of Soviet people had not sacrificed their lives in the anti-fascist war, we would not be meeting here now."
    The Literature Group Passed a Resolution Calling on Writers to Actively Strive for the Cause of Peace
    Finally, the meeting passed a resolution, which briefly stated: "As writers, we cannot remain silent. We celebrate this conference, and we will leave it full of determination, moving forward with the noble will to ensure that our people do not suffer the horrors of war. We call on all writers to express their opinions, use their talents to explain the truth, and strive for the cause of peace." At the meeting of the Literature Group, a group of writers who had sold themselves to Wall Street tried to obstruct the proceedings, but under a strong counterattack, the obstructors retreated in panic.
    At the meeting of the Public Propaganda Group, film, radio, and newspaper workers discussed their tasks in defending peace. Lawson, a famous American playwright who had been sentenced for contempt of the Un-American Activities Committee, spoke painfully about the fact that American films were being used to prepare for war. This is the main reason why the crisis and depravity of American films are becoming increasingly profound today.
    Famous American Playwright Lawson: Oppose the Use of American Films to Prepare for War
    Lawson said: Propaganda for war inevitably promotes extreme narrow patriotism, racism, and hysteria; the production of such films has met with strong resistance from film workers and film audiences who boycott such films. The current struggle surrounding the ten famous figures in Hollywood (who were tried for making films with democratic consciousness) shows that American film workers are ready to fight to defend peace. The speech by Soviet filmmaker Gerasimov made a deep impression on the audience. He emphasized the noble activities of Soviet artists, especially filmmakers, which are manifested in promoting freedom, democratic national independence, and advocating the ideas of universal happiness and peace throughout the world. He said: The socialist system determines our creative method - socialist realism. During the war, Soviet films served the noble purpose of eliminating the fascist plague as soon as possible for the whole world. Now, all the forces of our society, our cultural policies, are directed towards one goal: to stop war. Every Soviet artist fully knows the goal of his life and understands the great responsibility he bears for the future of humanity. Gerasimov urged artists to fully understand all their activities and the full responsibility they bear to the people. The American radio commentator Gus said that the American broadcast depends on the financial resources of industrialists and businessmen, which is a threat to social interests.
    At the meeting of the Economic and Social Science Group, the outstanding American professor of economics, Wayne, gave a speech, pointing out that the so-called "Cold War" has caused the United States to pay the largest financial expenditures except for the period of World War II. This year, the money spent on the "Cold War" is nearly 23 billion US dollars. But such an amount cannot satisfy the militarists of the United States. Wayne pointed out that the American economy is rapidly becoming wartime in nature and is declining. Wayne said: Increasing military production cannot bring stability to the American economy. The outstanding American women's movement activist Wittfish gave a speech attacking the racial policy of the United States and appealing for the oppressed people in the colony. Economist Sweezy made a detailed critique of the Marshall Plan, which is preparing for a new war. He said that the threat to peace lies in the attempt of the American ruling class to delay the inevitable economic recession by means of militarism and imperialism.
    The Education Group meeting was attended by six hundred teachers, university professors, and lecturers. The presidium included Professors Burtwatz, Phillips, and Gentrach, who were recently dismissed from the University of Washington for their progressive views. Professor Debell of the University of Illinois strongly attacked American war preparations. He said: The American people, like the people of other countries, want peace. They want peace more than anything else. Debell continued: Their desire for peace is so strong that every step in the preparation for war and the war propaganda in the newspapers and radio cannot but disguise itself as a step towards peace, even the North Atlantic Treaty, this major military alliance, is so. He pointed out that in many states of the United States, the rights of teachers to advocate peace have been threatened or completely deprived. Suppression bills have been introduced in many state legislatures, and the proponents and proposers of these bills do not conceal the fact that the purpose of these bills is to restrain all educators who support the Progressive Party or oppose the current war policy. A professor at the University of Washington was dismissed for supporting the scientific views of Academician Lee of the Soviet Academy of Sciences. Canisden, the director of the Art Department of Michigan University, also strongly condemned the persecution of people with progressive views in the United States.

　　摧毁华尔街的谎言
  　才能确保和平
    李查德·鲍耳
    在文学组会议上，美国作家李查德·鲍耳就作家在争取和平的斗争的责任问题，发表动人演说。他说：除非我们摧毁渗入美国生活各方面的各种各样的谎言，我们就不能够确保和平，有一种谎言说，主张和平的是卖国者，而策划战争的却是爱国者。按照这一谎言，据说，苏联建议解除军备是走向战争的步骤，而美国批准二十亿美元的预算，制造大规模毁灭性的武器，却是为了和平。鲍耳敦促美国作家揭发华尔街战争贩子所散播的这些谎言。听众对于苏联作家、斯大林奖金获得者巴甫连科的演说报以热烈的鼓掌。
    苏文学家巴甫连科：人类今天呼吸的空气充满人民劳动合作的理想
    巴甫连科说，从普式金时代起，苏联的文学就一直站在进步的方面。在苏维埃国家存在的三十一年间，我们的文学、出版、新闻事业、以及我们的戏剧和电影，对我们高尚的传统大有增益，在这一传统中充满着各国之间和平合作的理想。巴甫连科接着说：但是，如果我们披阅某些国家所出版的报纸或杂志，那么我们发现反动势力正在散播大量荒谬的、精神上堕落的战争宣传腐蚀着成百万读者的心灵。在德、意、日，被粉碎的法西斯主义势力正在重新集结，穿起新的伪装，为人类准备新的灾难，在这种时候，一切自认为是各国间和平合作之保卫者的人们，不能再保持缄默，再作一个毫不关心的旁观者。作家是人类灵魂的工程师、塑造者与设计家。我们有力量把我们认为对将来最有益处的世界观来塑造与培养我们的后代。如果大家一致努力，并决定共同的目标与任务，便没有什么能够阻挠我们的。人类今天呼吸的空气，充满着各国人民劳动合作的理想。巴甫连科着重地说：我们决不可失去对和平的信念，因为这意味着失去保卫和平的意志。各国人民不愿意把他们的子女抚养成人之后，让他们为一些象希特勒及其走卒那样疯狂政客的利益而牺牲，这些政客是可以在资本主义各国找到的。孩子们长大起来，一定要活而不是去死。我们必须教诲年青的一代：拿起武器进攻邻人，正如偷窃或强奸一样，也是犯罪的行为。我们会取得胜利，我们将击败战争的瘟疫，我们将扑灭象瘟疫一样迅速散布的侵略思想。美国名作家亚尔伯特·堪说：“三十年来，有人再三告诉我们说，苏联想推翻世界上别国政府。事实已证明完全相反，三十年来，是别国政府，包括美国政府在内，处心积虑要毁灭苏联。”他认为他自己对苏联是感激的，这不仅由于它在反法西斯战争中所起的作用，而且因为它领导着保卫和平的斗争。女作家斯沫特莱劝作家们以他们的才能为人民与和平事业服务。她说：“我们不要忘记，如果不是千百万苏联人民在反法西斯战争中献出他们的生命，我们现在决不会在这里开会”。
    文学组通过决议　号召作家积极努力为和平事业而奋斗
    最后会议通过决议，略称：“我们身为作家，不能缄口不言，我们庆贺这次大会，我们散会时必将满怀决心，本着保障我们人民不遭受战争恐怖这一崇高意志，向前迈进。我们号召一切作家，来表示他们的意见，运用他们的才能说明事实真相，为和平事业而奋斗。”在文学组的会议上，一批卖身给华尔街的作家试图阻挠，但在有力的还击下，阻挠分子仓惶退却。
    在民众宣传组会议上，电影、广播与报纸工作者讨论了他们保卫和平的任务。曾被以蔑视非美活动委员会的罪名而被判徒刑的、著名的美国剧作家劳森，痛心地谈到美国电影被用来准备战争的事实。这是今天美国电影危机愈陷愈深与堕落的主要原因。
    美名剧作家劳森：反对美国电影用来准备战争
    劳森说：宣传战争因而必然宣传极端偏窄的爱国主义、种族主义与歇斯底里；这种影片的摄制遭到电影工作者和抵制这类片子的电影观众的顽强抵抗。现在围绕着好莱坞十位著名人物（他们因为制造民主意识的影片而被审讯）进行的斗争，显示美国电影工作者随时准备为保卫和平而战斗。苏联影片摄制家格拉西莫夫的讲话，给予听众以深刻的印象。他着重指出苏联艺术工作者特别是电影工作者的高尚活动，表现在宣传自由、民主民族独立和主张全世界普遍幸福与和平的思想上。他说：社会主义制度确定了我们的创作方法——社会主义的现实主义。在战争期间，苏联的影片为全世界尽早解除法西斯瘟疫的高尚目的而服务。现在，我国社会的一切力量，我国的文化政策，都是向着一个目标：阻止战争。每一位苏联艺术家，完全知道他的生活目标，了解他对人类前途所负的伟大责任。格拉西莫夫力促艺术界人士充分了解他们的一切活动，在人民面前所负的全部责任。美国广播评论家格斯说：美国广播仰赖工商业家的财力，是对社会利益的威胁。
    在经济和社会科学组会议上，美国杰出的经济学教授魏恩发表了演说、他指出所谓“冷战”，使美国所付出的财政支出，成为除了第二次世界大战时期以外最庞大的数目。今年为“冷战”所花费的钱几乎达二百三十亿元。但这样的数额，也不能满足美国的军国主义者。魏恩指出美国经济迅速具有了战时性质，并正在衰退。魏恩说：增加军事生产，并不能给美国经济带来稳定。美国杰出的妇女运动者威特费希发表演说，攻击美国的种族主义政策，并为殖民地被压迫人民呼吁。经济学家斯维兹对准备新战争的马歇尔计划作了详尽的批判。他说：对和平的威胁在于美国统治阶级企图用军国主义及帝国主义手段来延缓不可避免的经济萧条。
    教育组会议有六百名教员、大学教授与讲师参加。在主席团中有不久前因观点进步而被华盛顿大学解聘的勃特瓦兹、菲列普斯及耿特拉奇三教授。伊利诺斯大学教授德布尔猛烈抨击美国的战争准备。他说：美国人民也和其他各国人民一样，是希望和平的。他们想要和平甚于一切。德布尔接着说：他们对和平的愿望是如此强烈，以致战争的每个准备步骤以及报上和广播中的战争宣传都不能不伪装成争取和平的步骤，甚至北大西洋公约这个主要的军事联盟也是如此。他指出，美国许多州内，教师们主张和平的权利已受到威胁或已完全被剥夺。许多州议会中已提出镇压法案，这些法案的赞成者和提议者都毫不隐讳这一事实，即这些法案的目的在于箝制那些支持进步党或反对现行战争政策的一切教育工作者。华盛顿大学一位教授因支持苏联科学院会员李某科的科学观点而被解聘。密契安大学艺术系主任凯尼斯登也猛烈谴责美国目前对具有进步观点的人士所加的迫害。
