To the Editors:

The re-evaluation of disability grades is currently underway for revolutionary martyrs and disabled soldiers in various regions. We have the following questions and would appreciate your answers:

(1) In the past, those who had an arm or a leg amputated were generally classified as first-class disabled soldiers. Now, according to the instructions of the North China People's Government, they are to be reclassified as second-class disabled soldiers. What is the reason for this?

(2) If a soldier, while serving in the army, sustains a hand or leg injury in combat at the front or is injured during an enemy mopping-up operation, resulting in a disability, should they be considered a revolutionary martyr or disabled soldier?

(3) If a soldier is admitted to a hospital due to illness and the treatment results in further damage, should they be entitled to a Certificate of Honor?

Qiao Yujin, Chen Tianfu, comrades:

Our answers to your inquiries are as follows:

1.  In the past, the Jin-Chahar-Hebei and Jin-Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region governments both stipulated that amputation of an arm or a leg constituted a second-class disability. If the original certificate indicated a first-class disability, it may have been incorrectly assessed at the time of evaluation, or the individual may have been referred from another neighboring region. If the original grade was incorrect, it is correct to adjust it according to the new grade. If the individual is from another region (such as Jin-Sui), the grade should be adjusted according to the regulations of the North China region.
    Furthermore, although Jin-Sui stipulated that amputation of a leg or arm constituted a first-class disability, the annual pension was 650 catties of millet, which is lower than the pension for second-class disabilities in our region. Therefore, we cannot simply compare the grades. Additionally, Grade B second-class disabled soldiers still retain some productive capacity and have already been allocated land in the old liberated areas. As long as they engage in production, they will not face hardship.

2.  Soldiers who sustain hand or leg injuries in combat at the front or are injured during an enemy mopping-up operation, resulting in disability, are all considered revolutionary martyrs and disabled soldiers.

3.  Those whose conditions worsen due to medical treatment in hospitals are not considered revolutionary martyrs and disabled soldiers, nor are they issued Certificates of Honor or pension certificates. They can be handled according to the Measures for the Treatment of Retired Soldiers Who are Old, Infirm, or Sick.

### 关于重评荣军等级问题

专栏：询问答复

　　关于重评荣军等级问题编辑同志：
    现各地荣誉军人正在进行重评残废等级，我们有以下几个疑问，请作解答：（一）在过去切断一臂或一腿者，大都评为一等荣军，现按华北人民政府指示则改为二等荣军，不知其原因何在？（二）参加部队在前方战斗中将手、腿、脚等部跌伤或在敌人扫荡时跌伤而成残废者，是否应算为荣军？（三）在部队中，因病住医院者，医治坏了，应否得荣誉证？
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　乔玉金、陈天富乔玉金、陈天富同志：
    兹将所询问题答复如下：一、切断一臂或一腿，过去在晋察冀及晋冀鲁豫两边区政府，均规定为二等残废；若原持有一等残废证的，可能是评等时评错，或系其他友邻区介绍来的。如果是原等级有错，改按新等执行是对的；如是外区来的（如晋绥），因各地等级规定不一致，但到我区后即应按华北区之规定执行。同时，原晋绥规定一腿或一臂切断虽为一等残废，但每年抚恤费为小米六百五十斤，比我区二等尚低，因此我们不能单从等级上来对比。并且，二等甲级尚有一部生产能力，在老区亦已分得土地，只要自己从事生产，生活是不会困难的。二、参加部队在前方战斗中将手腿跌伤或在敌人扫荡时跌伤致成残废者，均以荣军论。三、在医院治病治坏者不算荣军，亦不发荣誉证或抚恤证，可按年老病弱退伍军人待遇办法办理。
