　　Organize Cadres to Study Documents, Deeply Promote Production Propaganda
  　Pingxi District Committee Issues Instructions
    [Chahar News] During the Great Production Movement, some cadres in the Pingxi area did not pay enough attention to production work, believing that the masses would produce without leadership. They did not seriously study important documents related to production work and production techniques, and propaganda and education for Party members and the masses were insufficient. As a result, some masses (especially in newly liberated areas without land reform) still had many concerns about production. In addition, the rumors spread by landlords and old rich peasants to sabotage production were not refuted in a timely manner, which affected the development of the production movement. To this end, the Pingxi District Committee issued instructions on April 6 to strengthen propaganda and education work in the production movement, focusing on: (1) Each county must organize cadres to study relevant documents such as the North China Bureau's instructions on agricultural production and the Provincial Party Committee's instructions on launching the production movement in 1949, to overcome the erroneous idea of ​​underestimating production work. (2) In accordance with the spirit of the documents and the ideological concerns of the masses in various places, conduct extensive and in-depth propaganda among the masses, and refute rumors at any time. For example, in newly liberated areas without land reform, the spirit of resolutely not infringing on the interests of middle peasants, whoever cultivates owns the harvest, no wasteland is allowed, actively producing to become rich, and women participating in labor to eliminate dependence should be explained to the masses. (3) In branch education, focus on studying important documents related to production, connect with the thinking of Party members, review production work, and make each Party member make a production plan, so that Party members play a vanguard role among the masses and strive to become labor heroes or production models. (4) Restore, establish, and improve blackboard newspapers and rooftop broadcasting, making them powerful weapons to encourage the production enthusiasm of the masses and exchange production experiences. (5) Strengthen production reports, promote production work through Party newspapers, and the county party committees of each county should personally write comprehensive reports on the entire county in each stage.

　　组织干部学习文件深入开展生产宣传
  　平西地委发出指示
    【察哈尔讯】大生产运动中，平西地区某些干部对生产工作不够重视，认为群众不用领导也会生产，对生产工作的重要文件以及生产技术，没有认真研究，对党员、群众的宣传教育也不足，以致有些（特别是新区未作土地改革的地区）群众对于生产还有很多顾虑；再加上没有及时揭穿地主和旧富农破坏生产的谣言，使生产运动的开展受到影响。平西地委为此于四月六日发出加强生产运动中宣教工作的指示，着重提出：（一）各县必须组织干部研究华北局关于农业生产的指示、省委关于一九四九年开展生产运动的指示等有关文件，克服轻视生产工作的错误思想。（二）根据文件精神以及各地群众的思想顾虑，在群众中进行广泛而深入的宣传，并随时揭破谣言。比如在未作土改的新区，应向群众说明坚决不侵犯中农利益，谁种谁收，不许荒地，积极生产发财致富，妇女参加劳动清除依赖思想等精神。（三）在支部教育上，以学习有关生产的重要文件为主，联系党员的思想，检讨生产工作，使每个党员作出生产计划，使党员在群众中起先锋作用，争取当劳动英雄或生产模范。（四）恢复、建立、提高黑板报和屋顶广播，使其成为鼓舞群众生产情绪、交流生产经验的有力武器。（五）加强生产报导，通过党报推动生产工作，各县县委要亲自动手，写出每一阶段全县的综合报导。
