　　Specific Help Should Be Given to Elementary School Teachers in Their Studies
    There is now a very good objective condition for organizing on-the-job elementary school teachers to study, that is, the teachers generally have an urgent need to study revolutionary theory; but in our district, some teachers don't understand after reading this book, and still don't understand after reading that book, so they lose confidence in learning and reduce their enthusiasm for learning. Therefore, I hope that the leading organs can make specific instructions on the content of study for on-the-job elementary school teachers in the short term, and formulate some specific methods to help them study.

　　应该具体帮助小学教员学习
    组织在职小学教员学习，现在有一个很好的客观条件，即教员们普遍有学习革命理论的迫切要求；但在我们区里，有的教员看了这本书不懂，看了那本书依然不懂，于是便对学习丧失了信心，降低了学习情绪。因此，希望领导机关能在短期内作一关于在职小学教员学习内容的具体指示，并订些具体帮助他们学习的办法。
