　　Cooperatives Can Guarantee Workers' Real Wages

To the Editor:
    Because of price fluctuations, after wages are paid each month, the price of goods near the factory, especially the price of rice, always seems to rise once in a regular pattern. After six or seven days after wages are paid, the price of goods gradually falls back, so that wages calculated on the basis of commodities still cannot be guaranteed. Is it possible, according to the spirit of the Sixth National Labor Congress resolution, to establish state-run supply stores to supply the materials needed by the employees of state-owned factories?
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Military Labor Union of the North China Public Enterprise Department

Comrades of the Military Labor Union of the North China Public Enterprise Department:
    Regarding the issue of piloting a new rationing system in state-owned enterprises. We have asked the North China People's Government Enterprise Department to reply as follows:
    In factories in the mountains, as the letter states, "a large amount of currency appears in a small market, and grain tends to be in short supply." Grain prices will inevitably rise, and other daily necessities will also rise with grain prices, resulting in a large difference between workers' real wages and nominal wages. The best solution is for the labor union to run cooperatives, and the factory should provide strong assistance. Factory cooperatives should establish contact or business relationships with local county and district trade departments and cooperatives. At the same time, the trade department should also take the initiative to carry out material allocation to industrial areas, because there are still various difficulties in carrying out rationing work at present, and only when the work of cooperatives has a foundation can rationing work be done well.

### 办合作社可以保证工人实际工资

专栏：询问与答复

　　办合作社可以保证工人实际工资编辑同志：
    因为物价波动，我处每月发工资后，在工厂附近的物价，特别是米价，总有一次似乎是规律性的上涨，等到工资发过六七天后，物价又渐渐疲落，致使以实物为计算基础之工资，仍然不能得到保证。可否根据六次劳大决议之精神，办理国家供给商店，以供给公营工厂职工所需要的物资。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　华北公营企业部军工会华北企业部军工会的同志们：
    关于国营企业中试办新的配给制度问题。我们已请华北人民政府企业部答复如下：
    在山沟里的工厂发工资后，确如来信所说：“大量货币涌现一个小市场上，粮食因有供不应求之趋势。”粮价必然上涨，其他日用品，亦随粮价而上涨，致使工人的实际工资与名义工资相差很大。解决的办法，最好由工会办理合作社，工厂应大力帮助。工厂合作社，应与所在地县区贸易部门及合作社取得联系或业务关系。同时贸易部亦应主动向工业区进行物资调剂工作，因目前办理配给工作，尚有多种困难，也只有合作社工作有基础，才能做好配给工作。　　　　　—编者
