Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, April 8th: More than 40 representatives of officers from the Kuomintang cruiser "Chongqing" who revolted and Kuomintang air force personnel who joined the People's Liberation Army successively, held a symposium on the 1st. After Wang Jijie and other officers from the "Chongqing" reported on the uprising of the ship and its bombing, the participants rose up to denounce the various crimes committed by American imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries against the Chinese people. Yu Qingrong, a former instructor at the Kuomintang Air Force Academy, cited the facts he had personally witnessed of American imperialism directly participating in the Kuomintang reactionaries' operations, saying: "In April last year, I was serving in the Kuomintang Air Force combat unit, stationed in Qingdao. At that time, the Kuomintang troops of Chen Jincheng and Zhang Tianzu in Weixian were surrounded. The director of the Second Department of the Second Military Region of the Kuomintang Air Force colluded with the American imperialist element Chennault to have Chennault's air force bomb the periphery of Weixian every night in an attempt to save the Kuomintang troops from defeat. The bombing of the "Chongqing" this time is just one of countless incidents of American imperialists directly slaughtering the Chinese people." Aviator Zhang Yunong exposed the fact that the Kuomintang reactionaries ordered the air force to indiscriminately bomb Kaifeng and the Yellow River Iron Bridge. All the participants expressed extreme indignation. Wang Jijie said, "In order to commemorate the destruction of the "Chongqing," I still keep a piece of shrapnel from the bomb. When I see it, it will arouse hatred in my heart." Aviator Wang Yuke said: "Although the "Chongqing" was destroyed, its righteous appeal to the Kuomintang naval personnel is indestructible. Two years ago, Liu Shanben's uprising aircraft was bombed, but at that time, although I was still in the United States, his righteous behavior deeply moved me. Now I have finally followed him. Many planes have followed him. The Kuomintang navy is the same, they will follow the "Chongqing" to the people's ocean one after another." Many representatives listed the greatness of the people's construction strength they had seen after arriving in the liberated areas, and unanimously expressed their infinite hope and confidence in the construction and development of the people's navy and air force. They expressed that they would actively study in order to participate in this glorious construction work. The meeting unanimously decided to send a telegram to Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and the CPC peace negotiation delegation, supporting the complete realization of Chairman Mao's eight peace conditions. In addition, it was also decided to send a telegram to the Kuomintang naval and air force personnel, calling on them to take resolute action quickly, stand on the side of the people, and participate in the construction of the people's new navy and new air force.

　　通电国民党海空人员
  　迅速弃暗投明
    【新华社沈阳八日电】起义的国民党巡洋舰重庆号军官和先后参加解放军的国民党空军人员代表四十余人，于一日举行座谈会。重庆号军官王继捷等报告该舰起义及被炸经过后，与会者即纷起控诉美国帝国主义及国民党反动派残害中国人民的种种罪行。前国民党空军军官学校教官禹庆荣举出他亲见的美国帝国主义直接参加国民党反动派作战的事实说：“去年四月，我在国民党空军作战部队任职，驻扎青岛。当时潍县国民党军陈金城、张天佐等部被围，国民党空军第二军区第二处处长即与美国帝国主义分子陈纳德商定，由陈纳德航空队每夜到潍县外围轰炸解放军，以图挽救国民党军的败局。此次轰炸重庆号，不过是美国帝国主义者无数次直接屠杀中国人民事件中的一次而已。”航空员张雨农揭发了国民党反动派命令空军滥炸开封和黄河大铁桥的事实。与会者无不表示极度愤慨。王继捷说：“为了纪念重庆号的被毁，我现在还保存着一块炸弹的弹片。我看到它就会激起心头的仇恨”。航空员王玉珂说：“虽然重庆号被炸毁了，但它对国民党海军人员的正义感召是不可毁灭的。两年前刘善本起义的飞机被炸毁了，那时我虽还在美国，但他的正义行为深深地打动了我。现在我终于跟着他来了。很多飞机跟着他来了。国民党的海军也一样，他们将相继跟着重庆号开到人民的海洋里来。”许多代表列述他们到解放区后所见人民建设力量的伟大，一致对人民的海军、空军的建设与发展寄以无限的希望和信心。他们表示将积极学习，以参加这一光荣的建设工作。会议一致决定致电毛主席、朱总司令和中共和平谈判代表团，拥护彻底实现毛主席的八项和平条件。此外，并决定致电国民党海军空军人员，号召他们迅速采取决然的行动，站到人民方面来，参加人民的新海军、新空军的建设事业。
