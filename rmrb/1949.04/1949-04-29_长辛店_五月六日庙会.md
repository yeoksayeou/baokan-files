  　May 6th Temple Fair
    [Ping City News] The Changxindian Temple Fair will be held from the 6th to the 9th of next month. In previous years, the enemy forced the town's April (lunar calendar) Temple Fair to be suspended. After liberation, our People's Government, in order to promote the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas, specially advocated and decided to restore it. (Hao Ran)
