　　Based on the Principle of Mutual Benefit for Labor and Management and Public-Private Partnership
  　Kailuan Coal Mine Labor and Management Reach Agreement
    Mine Pays Off Old Debts, Ensures Workers' Livelihood and Safety
    North China People's Government Loans 300 Million Yuan to Support Production
    [This newspaper's report] This newspaper reporter Bai Qing reports: Although Tangshan was liberated as early as last December, the worker and factory sides of the Kailuan Coal Mine faced some difficult problems that have not been well resolved, which has greatly affected production. For example, in the Kailuan Tangshan Mine, the capitalist side did not pay attention to worker safety and violated mine regulations. Tragic accidents occurred continuously (see this newspaper on April 5th for details). Although all employees reasoned with them and put forward three demands, and the mine side had already accepted them, the mine side still did not conduct a detailed and thorough investigation and registration of all safety facilities above and below the mine after the event, nor did it put forward any opinions on how to improve them, so that the can rope broke again in early April. Ventilation and anti-poisoning equipment has also not been improved. Also, because the mine side has no long-term plans for production, in order to increase output, preparatory work was stopped and dead ends and rock tunnels were halted in some mining areas, affecting the long-term mining of the mine. In addition, regarding the issue of wages, no wages were paid from last December after liberation to early April of this year. The workers' union negotiated with the mine on April 5th and reached an agreement stipulating that old debts would be paid off within two months. The workers' union also requested that the mine return old debts in flour and guarantee that there would be no more arrears in the future. The mine side promised to respond within ten days, but has not yet responded. The agreement that has been reached between the two sides has not been announced and implemented by the Mining Bureau. Due to the large amount of unpaid wages, workers' lives are extremely difficult, and many people are starving. Many workers have been forced to seek other employment and cannot go to the mine for production. Therefore, the Kailuan Coal Mine Workers' Union, representing the opinions of all workers, requested that the North China People's Government help resolve the above problems to benefit production. In addition, since last October, due to traffic interruptions, Kailuan Coal Mine has had one million tons of coal stored that has not been transported out. Funds cannot be turned over. After liberation, although the People's Government has helped several times, due to the heavy military transportation on the railway, the transportation capacity is still insufficient, and funds still cannot be turned over, and workers' arrears cannot be repaid. Therefore, the mine side also asked the North China People's Government to send personnel to study the production and management situation of Kailuan and continue to provide assistance. The Industry and Commerce Department of the North China People's Government then sent letters to the labor and management of Kailuan, requesting them to send representatives to Beiping to discuss the matter.

    Government Convened Labor and Management for Consultation Based on the Needs of Both Parties
    The first meeting was held on April 18th. The worker representatives who attended were Yang Zhan, Deputy Director of the Tangshan Federation of Trade Unions, and Kailuan Mine worker representatives Chai Baocheng, Liu Cun, Shang Shan, Cao Xingshun, Yuan Zhiliang, and Shi Baoxiang, seven people in total. The mine side representatives were Yu Mingde, General Manager of the Kailuan Mining Bureau, Peilie (British), and Wei Chun, the person in charge of the mining area. First, Yao, Minister of the Industry and Commerce Department of the North China People's Government, reported the purpose of the meeting, followed by representatives from both sides expressing their opinions. The issues raised by the worker representatives were: (1) Guarantee the livelihood of employees and implement the April 5th agreement. (2) The mine side guarantees the safety of employees' lives and implements mine safety rules. (3) The mine side should make long-term plans for production and change unreasonable mining methods. (4) Reform the existing unreasonable system. The issues raised by the mine side were: (1) Increase railway transportation volume. (2) Reduce special export taxes. (3) Request government loans. (4) Determine Kailuan's coal production. The conference decided that two representatives from each of the labor and management sides, plus three military representatives stationed in Kailuan by the government, would form a sub-committee to exchange views on the above issues.

    In Order to Cooperatively Increase Production, Miners Should Abide by Labor Discipline
    After four days of repeated consultations, the labor and management sides reached the following agreement: (1) Regarding the issue of employee benefits, in addition to the labor-management agreements of April 5th and April 1st remaining valid, the old debt of flour will be fully repaid from now (April 22nd) to June 15th, with half of it repaid before May 20th. (2) Regarding the issue of ensuring the safety of employees' lives, the mine side guarantees to implement mine regulations, respect the opinions of the employee safety committee, and accept its supervision. (3) Regarding production issues: the mine side should still conscientiously implement the policy of long-term planning for the development of production for underground coal mining projects and all production-related equipment above ground. Immediately correct the measures of stopping the construction of dead ends and rock tunnels and other preparatory projects. The mine side should immediately formulate a production plan, which should include the repair and addition of coal mining preparation projects and all production-related equipment above and below ground. The formulation of the plan should solicit the opinions of the worker representatives of the workers' union, and the mine side should actively find ways to purchase and transport all materials related to production and safety equipment. (4) Under the condition that the mine side implements the above conditions, all employees should abide by labor discipline in accordance with the principle of mutual benefit for labor and management, and work together to increase production and promote economic prosperity. This agreement was jointly signed by Yang Zhan, Deputy Director of the Tangshan Federation of Trade Unions, and Yu Mingde, General Manager of Kailuan Mine, on the morning of April 22nd.

    A conference was held at 11:00 am on April 22nd. At the meeting, Minister Yao first explained the opinions of the North China People's Government on the Kailuan issue: He first pointed out that "After the liberation of Ping, Tianjin, and Tangshan, the People's Government, based on the principle of mutual benefit for labor and management and public-private partnership, has given Kailuan Coal Mine a lot of help. After the liberation of Tangshan, in order to solve the difficulties of Kailuan Mine having no money or food to pay wages and to prevent employees from starving, the Jidong Trading Company and the Great Wall Bank exchanged 1,500 tons of miscellaneous grains for 40,000 tons of coal and purchased 70,000 tons of coal with 14 million yuan in People's Currency. During the old Lunar New Year, the mine side only distributed 300,000 tons of coal to workers as a bonus because they had no money or food. At that time, the employees could not sell it, so the North China Trade Corporation and Tangshan Trading Company recovered 300,000 tons of coal tickets from the employees in exchange for flour and cloth. Also, when overseas transportation had not yet recovered shortly after liberation, the People's Government first specially allowed Kailuan Coal to transport 50,000 tons to Shanghai to exchange for flour, and later successively specially allowed Kailuan Coal to exchange 250,000 tons for flour. It also specially allowed Kailuan Radio Station to contact outside the area. Especially during the busy military transportation period, the Tianjin Railway Bureau tried its best to transfer vehicles to transport Luan coal, totaling more than 300,000 tons. It is precisely because of the above assistance from the government that Kailuan Coal Mine has been able to maintain production during the current tense military period." Subsequently, Minister Yao explained that the North China People's Government "Based on the current situation of Kailuan Coal Mine and the results of consultations with the mine side and worker representatives in the past four days, in order to enable Kailuan Mine to increase the amount of coal mining, improve coal mining methods, and repay employees' old debts, the government has decided to continue to provide Kailuan Coal Mine with the following assistance and will begin to implement it after the meeting. (1) The People's Bank of China will provide Kailuan Mining Bureau with a loan of 300 million yuan in People's Currency, which will be repaid by Kailuan Mining Bureau in installments with cash or in kind. (2) The North China Trade Corporation will purchase 1.7 million kiln pillars from the Northeast on behalf of Kailuan. The delivery to Kailuan will begin in May to solve the difficulty of Kailuan's serious shortage of kiln pillars. (3) The North China People's Government agreed to reduce the special export tax on Kailuan coal from 30% to 15%, so that the export of Luan coal can obtain higher profits. (4) In order to take care of Kailuan Mine's difficulty in cash turnover, the North China People's Government agreed to completely change Kailuan Mine's import and export taxes, and production and sales taxes to in-kind payment. (5) The Pingjin Railway Bureau has agreed to increase the transportation volume of Luan coal to 10,000 tons per day in the near future, but requires Kailuan Mine to actively shorten the loading and unloading time in order to increase the transportation volume. This is to be established by an agreement between Kailuan and the Pingjin Railway Bureau. (6) The North China People's Government agrees that the price of Kailuan coal can be appropriately adjusted according to the rise in prices. In the future, the Tianjin Fuel Management Committee will convene a special meeting to study and determine it. (7) Agree to Kailuan Coal Mine actively exploring overseas sales channels."

    Minister Yao Emphasized:
    The Demands Put Forward by Employees Are Justified, the Mine Side Should Improve Mining Methods
    In his speech, Minister Yao stated the People's Government's policy of mutual benefit for labor and management and public-private partnership. He affirmed that the government would definitely help solve the current difficulties of the Kailuan factory, and the above seven articles are the specific assistance of the People's Government to the Kailuan Coal Mine Company. Minister Yao continued to emphasize that the various demands put forward by the worker representatives at the meeting were justified. He said: "The realization of these demands will enable the existing unreasonable mining methods of Kailuan Mine to be improved, and the lives and safety of employees to be guaranteed. These demands are in line with the interests of all employees and also in line with the interests of entrepreneurs who invest in Kailuan. The Kailuan Mining Bureau should accept and implement these demands; because the Kailuan Mining Bureau has the responsibility to guarantee the lives and safety of workers and to guarantee the long-term mining of the coal mine." In his concluding remarks, he pointed out: "In the past few months, Kailuan employees have resolutely implemented the call of the People's Government, persisted in production, and overcome difficulties in the difficult conditions of having no guarantee of life and safety, and have mined more than 500,000 tons of coal. This is an important contribution of Kailuan employees to Kailuan and to the revolutionary war. The government hopes that both the Kailuan Mining Bureau and the employees will jointly implement the policy of 'public-private partnership and mutual benefit for labor and management' in the future in order to restore and develop the industrial construction of the New Democratic country. Neither side should implement the policy of one-sided benefit for labor and management and public-private partiality. That is harmful to production and to all aspects."

    After Minister Yao's speech, representatives from both labor and management successively expressed their opinions. Yu Mingde, General Manager of Kailuan Mining Bureau, said: "This meeting, under the leadership of the People's Government and with the efforts of the worker representatives, has solved many problems. The government has helped a lot, and we are very grateful! We should work hard to do what we should do so as not to live up to the goodwill of the government's help and the efforts of the employees." Wei Chun, the person in charge of the Kailuan mining area, said: "Both parties must take responsibility for the results of this meeting. I will definitely abide by the agreement and do a good job regarding the safety of workers' lives and technical issues. In the future, I hope everyone will further cooperate and work hard for the country in accordance with the government's intentions." Chai Baocheng, a representative of Kailuan Mine employees in Tangshan, said: "Today, I represent all employees in expressing that in the future, under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the People's Government, we will resolutely advance in accordance with the policy of 'developing production and mutual benefit for labor and management'. As long as the mine side sincerely implements these conditions, we will definitely work together with the mine side to develop production with all our strength to support the People's Liberation War, so that the country will win victory at an early date!" Yang Zhan, Deputy Director of the Tangshan Federation of Trade Unions, said: "When Tangshan was liberated, all employees made a heroic struggle to protect the mine. Coupled with the rapid action of the People's Liberation Army, the mining area was preserved. After liberation, all employees, in the face of hunger and starvation, continued to work hard and overcome difficulties for the benefit of the entire employees and the mine side, and for the economic construction of the New Democratic country. In the past, due to the mine side's lack of understanding of the policies of the People's Government, it adopted a delaying attitude towards the issue of employees' lives and safety, but these things are all in the past. Today, under the correct leadership of the People's Government, all kinds of problems such as employees' lives, safety, and production have been satisfactorily consulted and resolved. We hope that the mine side will further understand government laws and regulations and strictly implement the agreement. At the same time, our employees themselves, under the condition that the mine side implements the agreement, will definitely abide by labor discipline and complete the great production task." At this point, the meeting closed in a harmonious and pleasant atmosphere.

　　本劳资两利公私兼顾原则
  　开滦煤矿劳资双方获协议
    矿方还清旧欠保障职工生活及安全
    华北人民政府贷款三亿元扶植生产
    【本报讯】本报记者柏青报导：唐山虽早于去年十二月解放，但是开滦煤矿的工人方面和工厂方面均有一些困难问题，未能获得很好解决，以致影响生产很大。比如开滦唐山矿因资方不重视工人安全，违反矿章。曾连续发生惨案（四月五日详见本报）。虽经全体职工据理力争，提出三项要求，并已经矿方接受，但事后矿方对所有矿务井上井下一切安全设施，仍未进行详细周密的调查登记，也还没提出如何改善的意见，以致于四月初罐绳又断过一次。通风防毒设备亦未改善。又由于矿方对生产没有长期打算，为了增加产量，在某些矿区停止了预备工程停止作死处与石峒。影响矿山的长期开采。此外在工资问题上，从去年十二月解放后，至今年四月初未发工资。职工会于四月五号与矿方交涉获得协议，规定两月内还清旧欠，职工会并提出要求矿方归还旧欠面粉，保证以后不再拖欠，矿方答应在十天内答复，至今迄未答复，双方已成立的协议，矿务局亦始终未布告执行。由于工资积欠很多，工人生活极为困难，许多人陷于饥饿。有不少工人被迫另外谋生，不能上矿生产。为此开滦煤矿职工会，代表全体工人意见，要求华北人民政府帮助解决上述问题以利生产。又如自去年十月以来，开滦煤矿由于交通断绝，存煤百万吨未曾运出。资金无法周转。解放后，虽经人民政府数度帮助，但因铁路军运繁忙，运输力仍感不足，资金仍无法周转，工人积欠无力归还。因此矿方亦曾请华北人民政府派员研究开滦生产及经营情况，继续予以帮助。华北人民政府工商部乃根据双方要求函告开滦劳资双方各派代表来北平会商。
    政府根据双方要求召集劳资双方会商
    四月十八号开第一次会议。出席之职工代表为唐山职工总会副主任杨展、开滦矿职工代表柴宝成、刘存、尚山、曹兴顺、苑志良、石宝祥等七人。矿方代表为开滦矿务局总经理余明德裴利耶（英人）矿区主管魏肫，首由华北人民政府工商部姚部长报告开会目的，继由双方代表发表意见。职工代表提出的问题是：（一）保证职工生活，执行四月五日协议。（二）矿方保障职工生命安全，执行矿厂安全规则。（三）矿方对生产应作长期打算，改变不合理的开采方法。（四）改革现存的不合理制度。矿方提出的问题是：（一）增加铁路运输量。（二）减低特许出口税。（三）要求政府贷款。（四）确定开滦煤产量。大会决定由劳资双方各派代表二人，政府派驻开滦军事代表三人合组小组委员会，对以上问题交换意见。
    为了协力增加生产矿工应守劳动纪律
    经四天数度磋商，劳资双方达成了以下协议：（一）关于职工待遇问题，除四月五日与四月一日之劳资协议书仍然有效外，旧欠面粉部份自即日起（四月廿二日）至六月十五日全部归还，五月二十日前还清一半。（二）关于保障职工生命安全问题，矿方保证执行矿厂规则，并尊重职工安全委员会之意见，接受其监督。（三）关于生产问题：矿方对井下采煤工程及井上一切有关生产设备，仍应按照发展生产长期打算之方针认真执行。立刻纠正停做死处与石峒及其他预备工程之措施。矿方应立即制定生产计划，此计划应包括采煤预备工程及井上下一切有关生产设备之修理与增添。计划之制订应征求职工会职工代表意见，矿方对有关生产及安全设备之一切器材，应积极设法购运。（四）在矿方执行上述条件下，全体职工应本劳资两利方针，遵守劳动纪律，协力增加生产，繁荣经济。此项协议于四月二十二日上午已由唐山职工总会副主任杨展、开滦矿总经理余明德共同签字。
    四月廿二日上午十一时举行大会。会上首由姚部长说明华北人民政府对开滦问题的意见：他首先指出“平、津、唐解放后，人民政府本劳资两利公私兼顾的原则，曾给开滦煤矿不少帮助，唐山解放后，冀东贸易公司及长城银行为解决开滦矿无钱无粮发放工资之困难，使职工免于饥饿，曾以杂粮一千五百吨换回煤四万吨，以人民券一千四百万元购煤七万吨。旧历年关时，矿方因无钱无粮，只给工人发煤三十万吨以代花红。当时职工无法出售，华北贸总及唐山贸易公司以面粉布匹向职工收回煤票三十万吨。又当解放不久，海外交通未复之际，人民政府首先特许开滦煤五万吨运沪换面，其后又陆续特许开滦煤二十五万吨换取面粉。并特许开滦电台与区外联络。尤其是在军运繁忙之际，天津路局尽力抽调车辆运输滦煤共达三十余万吨。正由于政府以上帮助，才使开滦煤矿在目前紧张军事时期得以维持生产。”随后姚部长说明，华北人民政府“根据目前开滦煤矿情况，经四日来与矿方与职工代表会商的结果，为了使开滦矿增加采煤数量，改进采煤方法，归还职工旧欠，政府决定继续给开滦煤矿以下列帮助，并于会后开始执行。（一）中国人民银行给予开滦矿务局人民券三亿元的贷款，此项贷款由开滦矿务局以现款或实物分期归还。（二）华北贸易总公司代开滦向东北采购窑柱一百七十万根。五月份开始交付开滦，以解决开滦严重缺乏窑柱之困难。（三）华北人民政府同意将开滦煤特许出口税由百分之三十降低为百分之十五。使滦煤出口能获得较高利润。（四）为照顾开滦矿现金周转困难，华北人民政府同意将开滦矿应纳之进出口税产销税完全改为实物缴纳。（五）平津铁路局已同意在最近期间将滦煤运输量提高至每日一万吨，但要求开滦矿积极缩短装卸时间，以求增加运量。此项由开滦与平津铁路局成立协定。（六）华北人民政府同意开滦煤价得根据物价上涨情况作适当调整。今后由天津燃管会召集专门会议研讨确定之。（七）同意开滦煤矿积极开拓对外销路。”
    姚部长强调提出：
    职工所提要求正当　矿方应改善开采方法
    姚部长在发言中，申述人民政府劳资两利公私兼顾的方针后，对开滦厂方目前困难政府一定帮助给以解决，上述七条就是人民政府对开滦煤矿公司的具体帮助，姚部长继续强调提出会议上职工代表所提各项要求是正当的，他说：“这些要求的实现，将使开滦矿现存之不合理的开采方法得以改善，职工生活，生命安全获得保障。这些要求符合全体职工利益，同时也符合于投资于开滦的实业家的利益。开滦矿务局应当接受与执行这些要求；因为开滦矿务局有保障工人生活与安全及保障煤矿长远开采的责任。”在结语中，他指出：“过去数月中开滦职工在生活与安全没有保障的困难条件下，坚决执行人民政府号召，坚持生产，克服困难，采煤达五十余万吨。这是开滦职工对于开滦及对革命战争的重要贡献。政府希望今后开滦矿务局与职工双方共同执行‘公私兼顾、劳资两利’的方针。以恢复与发展新民主主义国家的工业建设。无论那一方面都不应执行劳资一利公私偏顾的方针。那是对生产对各方面都是有害的。”
    姚部长发言后，劳资双方代表都相继发表自己意见。开滦矿务局总经理余明德说：“此次开会，在人民政府领导之下及职工代表大家努力之下，解决了很多问题，政府帮了很多忙，我们感激得很！我们应努力我们所应做的事情，以不负政府帮助与职工努力的善意”。开滦矿区主管魏肫说：“对于此次会议结果，双方都要负起责任来，对于工人方面的生命安全及技术问题我一定遵守协议好好去做。今后希望大家进一步合作，本着政府的意思，替国家努力。”唐山开滦矿职工代表柴宝成说：“今天我代表全体职工表示：今后我们要在毛主席及人民政府领导下，坚决本着‘发展生产，劳资两利’的方针前进。只要矿方真心实意执行这些条件，我们一定与矿方共同协力发展生产，以全副力量支援人民解放战争，使全国早日胜利！”唐山职工总会副主任杨展说：“唐山解放时，全体职工曾做了英勇护矿斗争，加上人民解放军的迅速行动，矿区得以保全。解放后全体职工在忍饥挨饿的情况下，为了整个职工与矿方益利，为了新民主主义国家的经济建设，克服困难，继续努力。过去由于矿方对人民政府政策不很了解，对职工生活与安全问题，采取延不解决的态度，但这些事情都已成过去了。今天在人民政府正确领导下，关于职工生活，生命安全及生产等各种问题都得到圆满的会商结果。我们希望矿方今后要进一步了解政府法令，厉行协议，同时，我们职工本身，在矿方执行协议的条件下，一定遵守劳动纪律，完成伟大的生产任务。”至此，会议在和谐愉快的气氛中闭幕。
