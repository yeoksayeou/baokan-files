　　North China People's Government Ministry of Health
  　Issues Instructions for Smallpox Vaccination
    [This newspaper] Smallpox is highly prevalent in the region this spring. It has occurred commonly in LaiShui, BaoYuan, ZhangBei, ChongLi and other counties of Chahar Province. Therefore, the Ministry of Health of the North China People's Government has issued "Instructions for Implementing Smallpox Vaccination," instructing all levels of health agencies, public hospitals, social education departments, and mass organizations to pay attention to prevention and eliminate smallpox transmission. In addition to government, medical institution and health personnel carrying out vaccination, private hospitals, pharmacies, village doctors, etc., should be entrusted and organized in a mobilized and incentivized manner to assist in vaccination. In remote areas lacking vaccination sites and medicine, and in areas where smallpox is prevalent, mobile anti-epidemic medical teams should be organized to conduct vaccinations. The instructions stipulate that more than 40% of urban and rural residents under the age of thirteen should be vaccinated, and more than 70% of collective places such as primary schools, kindergartens, factories, and mines should be vaccinated. In areas where smallpox is prevalent, mandatory vaccination should reach more than 90%. The Beiping Epidemic Prevention Office has also manufactured a large number of smallpox vaccines for use throughout the region.

  　指示实施种痘
    【本报讯】今春本区天花流行甚炽，察省涞水、保源、张北、崇礼等县普遍发生，为此，华北人民政府卫生部特发布“实施种痘指示”，指示各级卫生机关、公立医院及社教部门民众团体等注意防预，杜绝天花传染，除政府及医疗机关卫生人员必须进行施种外，并须以动员奖励方式，委托与组织私立医院、药房、乡医等协助施种。一般没有种痘处所及缺乏医药的荒僻地区、天花流行地区，则应组织防疫医疗队巡回施种。指示规定城乡居民十三岁以下儿童应种到百分之四十以上，小学校、幼稚园、工厂、矿山等集体场所应种到百分之七十以上，天花流行地区，应强制接种到百分之九十以上。北平防疫处并制造了大批痘苗，供给各地使用。
