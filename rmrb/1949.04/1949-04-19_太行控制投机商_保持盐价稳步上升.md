Taihang Controls Speculators
  Maintaining a Steady Rise in Salt Prices
    [Taihang Electric] In early March, as salt prices rose, the Taihang Trade Company prevented speculators from causing trouble in advance, achieving a stable increase in salt prices. In half a month, the price only increased by two yuan per jin. The specific methods were: 1. Organize forces to concentrate salt, quickly transporting sea salt from the eastern line to the main towns of the Taihang region, such as She County and Changzhi on the Handan-Changzhi line. 2. Salt prices were gradually increased along with market prices, while gradually maintaining them below market prices. We opposed raising prices several times a day, and instead raised them appropriately every few days, with only small price increases each time. 3. Distinguish between different targets and sell freely, focusing on entrusting sales to government agencies, production stores, and cooperatives; control speculators and do not sell to them.

　　太行控制投机商
  　保持盐价稳步上升
    【太行电】三月上旬盐价上涨，太行贸易公司事先防止了投机商的捣乱，做到了盐价的平稳上升。半个月中，每斤只上升二元。具体做法是：一、组织力量集中食盐，迅速把东线的海盐运到太行区各线的主要城镇，如邯长线上之涉县、长治等地。二、食盐价格采取由随市价稳步上升，而逐渐保持低于市价的办法，反对一日几次上升，隔几日适当上升一次，每次上升价格的距离也很小。三、区别对象，放手出卖，有重点地委托机关生产商店与合作社出售；对投机商进行控制，不予卖给。
