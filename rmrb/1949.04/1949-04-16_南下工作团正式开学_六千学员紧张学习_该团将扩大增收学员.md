　　Southward Work Corps Officially Starts Classes
  　Six Thousand Students Studying Intensely
  　The Corps Will Expand and Recruit More Students
    [Our Newspaper] To coordinate with the southward advance of the army, the Southward Work Corps currently has two branches. The first branch in Beiping has officially started classes, and the second branch in Tianjin has also begun some classes. The two branches have a total of 6,100 students and staff, mainly consisting of university and middle school students. The Tianjin branch is also preparing to establish a workers' brigade. Further plans are now underway to establish four more branches, recruiting approximately 10,000 students, and to set up a research office, mainly composed of university professors and specialized technical personnel, currently numbering over forty. Additionally, there is a drama class with one hundred people. The Southward Work Corps' educational plan is to be implemented in three stages over four and a half months: The first stage, one and a half months, primarily involves classroom study of documents, enabling the members to gain a preliminary understanding of several basic issues in the current stage of China's New Democratic Revolution. The second stage, one and a half months on the southward journey, mainly involves conducting investigations and research along the way in liberated area cities and villages, receiving education from the workers and peasants, absorbing practical struggle experience, and cultivating a spirit of hard work. The third stage, after arriving at the destination, involves concentrating on further study for as long as one and a half months, summarizing and elevating the practical knowledge gained in the second stage, and conducting further study on the specific circumstances of the newly liberated areas of Jiangnan. Currently, the first detachment of the first branch is making the fastest progress and is the most enthusiastic and tense in their studies. They have now established various study organizations and systems and have formed a club, economic committee, wall newspaper group, choir, library, and cooperative. After a period of study, everyone has strong confidence and great determination. For example, Du Mian, from the second squad of the first detachment, had his fiancée come from the Northeast wanting him to return, but he not only resolutely refused to return but also persuaded his fiancée to join the work corps.

　　南下工作团正式开学
  　六千学员紧张学习
  　该团将扩大增收学员
    【本报讯】配合大军南下的南下工作团，现已有两个分团。在北平的第一分团已正式开学，在天津的第二分团亦有部分开课，两团共有学员及工作人员六千一百人，其中以大学生、中学生为主，天津分团并筹设职工大队。现更进一步计划成立四个分团，约收一万学员，并设研究室，以大学教授和专门技术人才为主，现已有四十余人。另外有一个戏剧班有一百人。南下工作团的教育计划，是以四个半月时间，分做三段来实现：第一段一个半月，主要是课堂学习文件，使团员对中国现阶段新民主主义革命中的若干基本问题作一初步了解。第二阶段南下路上，计划一个半月，主要是沿途对解放区城市、乡村的调查研究，接受工农群众的教育和吸收实际的斗争经验，锻炼艰苦奋斗的作风；第三阶段是在到达目的地之后，尽可能再集中学习一个半月，把第二阶段得到的实际知识，经过总结加以提高，对江南新解放区的具体情况再进行些学习。目下第一分团第一大队学习进步的最快，情绪也最热烈紧张，他们现在已经建立了各种学习组织和制度，并成立了俱乐部、经济委员会、墙报组、合唱团、图书馆、合作社。经过一段学习之后，大家信心很强，决心很大，如第一大队第二中队的杜勉，他的未婚妻从东北赶来要他回去，可是他不但坚决不回去，还说服了他的未婚妻参加了工作团。
