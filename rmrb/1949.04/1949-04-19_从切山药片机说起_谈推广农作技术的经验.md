　　Starting from a Yam Slicing Machine
　　Talking About Experiences in Promoting Agricultural Technology

　　In the summer of the year before last, I met a farmer named Zhang Bufu in Liusu Village, Ding County. This man was clever and skilled. He had never apprenticed, but he could do all kinds of work in mud, brick, wood, and iron. He once made a bicycle out of wood that could be ridden just like a real one... He made a man-powered waterwheel and a spinning wheel with eight threads... Even the oil lamp he used at home was very special, with an iron wire loop on the lamp to hold the wick, which was both fuel-efficient and bright. He also grew crops differently from others, often coming up with new tricks; grafting beans onto cucumber seedlings resulted in cucumbers that were long, crisp, and plentiful... I felt that this person would be very useful for the improvement and promotion of agricultural technology, so I often chatted with him. Once, he casually told me something, which, although very ordinary, increased my knowledge of this issue quite a bit.

　　He said that one year he went to the county to visit an agricultural exhibition. Among the exhibits was a "yam slicing machine." This machine was very convenient; as long as you put the yam into the machine and cranked the handle, the slices would fall like snow, more than ten times faster than cutting by hand. This area is rich in yams (sweet potatoes), which are one of the main food crops. Every year, in addition to putting a portion of the yams in cellars, most of them are cut into slices with a knife for drying and preservation. But this requires cutting one slice at a time, which is very time-consuming. Therefore, the visitors were very interested when they saw such a convenient machine.

　　But after looking at it, Zhang Bufu concluded: This yam slicing machine is good, but it just can't be promoted! Later, the facts proved that his judgment was correct. Not a single yam slicing machine was ever promoted. What exactly is the reason? He said that yam slicing is only done for a few days a year, so even the knife for slicing yams is not owned by every household. When needed, they have to borrow it from others, so who would buy this machine? This machine is certainly cheap, but it is ten times more expensive than a yam slicing knife. Secondly, although the yam slicing machine is easy to use, it requires a period of practice, which is difficult to achieve.

　　This yam slicing machine, although a small matter, provides many important insights for the improvement, modification, and promotion of agricultural technology:

　　First of all, the improvement, modification, and promotion of agricultural technology must take into account the existing economic foundation of the peasants. Without this, everything will fall flat. All improvement, modification, and promotion of agricultural technology must first focus on the technologies that the majority of peasants most urgently need to improve: such as locust control, seed soaking, drought prevention, flood prevention, etc., focusing first on the most important aspects of agricultural production.

　　Second, it must be something that peasants can currently afford and accomplish, so that it can be widely promoted. In the past, we promoted "live-bottom manure baskets," "May First waterwheels," etc... Although we have achieved many successes, they cannot be widely promoted. One of the main reasons is that farmers already have agricultural tools, and if you ask them to add a new one, they will first consider whether it is worthwhile. If the new one does not have a significant effect compared to the old one, but there is even a little bit of help, they will try their best to make do with the old one. For example, in the past, our newspapers and magazines have introduced a lot of scientific agricultural knowledge and methods, which have indeed played a significant role. But some of them are indeed a bit "remote"! I remember once introducing a method for killing aphids, using one catty of kerosene per mu of land, plus some western medicine... The teachers of the people's schools read this to the peasants, and the peasants scoffed and then smiled, as if they were listening to "Strange Tales of the Past and Present." This shows that even if the method is very effective, it would be difficult to implement.

　　Third, in the improvement, upgrading and promotion of agricultural technology, never think of promoting it comprehensively all at once. You must take it step by step. First, select a few farmers who are willing to accept new technologies, and actually achieve some results, first making a model for everyone to see. This is more important than any propaganda; everyone will follow suit.

　　Fourth, farmers originally have a lot of scientific farming techniques, but what is lacking is that they are very fragmented and unsystematic. As long as we remove some of the unscientific ones, collect, identify, systematize, and improve the scientific ones, and then promote them universally, it will be twice as effective as introducing "scientific technology" in a raw and uncritical way.

　　Any effort that meets the above points for improving, upgrading, and promoting agricultural technology will achieve significant results. For example, locust control—the whole set of methods from controlling nymphs to hitting adult locusts—is something that the masses like to accept.

### 从切山药片机说起　谈推广农作技术的经验

　　从切山药片机说起
  　谈推广农作技术的经验
    前年夏天，我在定县留宿村认识了一个叫张不服的农民，这人心灵手巧，从没投过师，可是泥、瓦、木、铁的活全会做。他曾经用木头做了一辆自行车，一样的能骑。……做了一辆人推的水车，做了一辆出八根线的纺车……就连他家里用的油灯，也非常特别，盏上有一个夹灯捻的铁丝圈，即省油又明亮。他种庄稼，也和人不一样，常常出些新花样；黄瓜苗上接豆夹，长出的黄瓜来又长、又脆、又多……我觉得这个人对于农作技术的改良和推广的工作上很有用处，所以时常找他闲谈；有一次他偶而和我说了一件事，虽很平常，但增加了我对这问题不少知识。
    他说，有一年他上县里参观了一个农业展览会。展览品中有一架“切山药片机”。这机器非常灵便，只要把山药塞在机器里，手摇机把，片如雪下，比起用手来切，何止快十倍。这一带盛产山药（红薯），是主要食粮之一。每年除了把一部分的山药下窖外，大部分都用刀切成片，以便晒干保存。但得一刀一刀的切，很费功夫。所以参观的人一见这么架灵便的机器都很感兴趣。
    但张不服看了，就断定：这架切山药片机好是好，可就是推广不了！后来事实证明他的判断是对的。这架切山药片机始终连一架也没推广出去。到底是什么道理呢？他说，切山药片一年也不过切几天，所以平常人家就连切山药片的刀也并不是一家一把，用时还得向旁的人家去借，谁还去买这架机器，这机器固然便宜，但比起切山药片的刀来要贵十倍。其次，这切山药片机固然用法简单，但也得经过一个时期的练习，这一点就难行得通。
    这架切山药片机虽是件小事，但对于农业技术的提高、改良和推广，却提供了不少重要的启示：
    首先，农业技术的提高、改良和推广，必须要照顾到农民现有的经济基础。离开了这一点一切都将会落空。一切农业技术的提高、改良和推广，第一必须是大多数农民最迫切需要改良和提高的技术：如治蝗、浸种、防旱、防涝……等，首先着重到最主要的农业生产方面。
    第二、必须是农民目前力能所及能够办得到的，这样才能普遍推广。过去我们推广过“活底粪篓”、“五一水车”……等，虽然获得了不少成就，但还不能普遍推广，其中有一个主要原因：农民已有了的农具，叫他重添置一种新的农具，他先要考虑的是合算不合算，若这新的比旧的没有显著的效果，但有一分奈何，他就尽先凑合着旧的用。又比方过去我们的报章杂志上，曾经介绍过不少科学的农业知识和办法，确实起了不少作用。但有一些也实在是比较“遥远”一点！记得有一回介绍了一个杀蚜虫的办法，每亩地用煤油一斤，还有若干西药……，民校教员拿这念给农民们听，农民们听了嗤之以鼻，继而微笑，仿佛听了“今古奇观”一般。这就可以想见这办法即使十分有效也就很难行得通的了。
    第三、农业技术的改良，提高与推广，千万别想一下子全面推广，必须一步一步的来。先选择几户愿意接受新技术的农民，切切实实做出一点成绩来，先做一个样子给大家看看。这样比任何宣传都要紧；大家就会跟着学。
    第四、农民中原来也就有很多合乎科学的农作技术，所不足的是很零碎，不系统，只要我们去掉一部分不合乎科学的。把合乎科学的加以收集、辨别、系统化而加以提高，再加以普遍推广，比起生吞活剥的来介绍“科学技术”，定会事半功倍。
    凡合乎以上数点来进行农作技术的改良、提高和推广的，成绩就显著。如治蝗——从治蝻到打成虫的一整套办法，就是群众喜欢接受的。
