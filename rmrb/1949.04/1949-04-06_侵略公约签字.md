　　Aggression Pact Signed
    [Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, 4th] According to Washington reports: The foreign ministers of twelve countries, including the United States, Britain, France, Canada, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, Norway, Italy, Denmark, Iceland, and Portugal, are scheduled to sign the North Atlantic Treaty today. The twelve foreign ministers, led by U.S. Secretary of State Acheson, issued a communique after consultations on the 2nd, rejecting the Soviet government's memorandum denouncing the North Atlantic Treaty as aggressive and violating the goals and principles of the United Nations. The communique also stated that once the North Atlantic Treaty is ratified by the participating countries, a consultative committee will be formed by the foreign ministers of the participating countries. The first task of the Consultative Committee is to establish a so-called "Joint Defense Committee" composed of twelve military personnel. According to the provisions of the North Atlantic Treaty, the "Joint Defense Committee" will make recommendations on matters related to the implementation of the two most important articles of the North Atlantic Treaty - Article 3 and Article 5. Article 3 stipulates the so-called "mutual assistance measures" between the contracting countries; Article 5 stipulates that when certain contracting countries suffer so-called "armed attacks," other contracting countries may "take necessary actions," "such actions include the use of force."
