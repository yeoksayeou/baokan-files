　　Lifting the Corner of the Kuomintang Navy's Secrets
　　Mu Qing
　　When the officers and soldiers of the "Chongqing" warship who revolted spoke to reporters about the corruption and crimes of the Kuomintang Navy authorities and war criminal Gui Yongqing, someone laughed and said, "Let's present his 'family treasures' and ask you to count them for him!"

　　Treating Torpedo Launchers as Rocket Launchers
　　War criminal Gui Yongqing, this "Commander-in-Chief of the Navy," didn't understand what the navy was, only that the navy was his private property. He gave important positions to relatives and friends. Old subordinates who had followed him in the Kuomintang Army, regardless of whether they understood the navy or not, put on navy uniforms and became captains and staff officers. One of Gui's nephews and one of his wife's nephews, knowing nothing, became battalion commanders of the navy's guard battalion. Once, a large group of senior generals from the Kuomintang Naval Headquarters visited the "Chongqing" warship and actually mistook the torpedo launcher for a rocket launcher and the minesweeping gear for torpedoes, sparking heated discussions that caused the entire ship's officers and soldiers to laugh afterwards. Gui's three wives and children could freely throw tantrums and scold people at the Naval Headquarters and on the warships. Truly talented naval cadres were squeezed out and had to leave the navy to seek other opportunities. A third of the personnel on the "Chongqing" warship alone angrily left.

　　Sixty Boxes of Ginseng
　　The "naval generals" who completely didn't understand the navy were very skilled in smuggling and looting. It was already common practice to use warships to smuggle opium from Chongqing to Shanghai. Last October, when Gui personally led the flagship to Yingkou, Northeast China, to respond to the retreat of the Kuomintang remnant army, he looted civilian sailboats and fishing boats loaded with goods in the waters around Yingkou and Huludao. Gui Yongqing alone received sixty boxes of ginseng. The "Emei" warship, which was anchored in Yingkou, simultaneously used machine guns to strafe the army requesting to board the ship for escape and nervously moved and checked the looted property. Afterwards, they gave a large share of the stolen goods to Gui, who greatly praised this. The "Emei" warship thus transformed from an oil tanker into a flagship, and the ship's captain was promoted from a lieutenant to a commodore.

　　A Month's Salary Couldn't Buy Three Bowls of Noodles
　　The Kuomintang navy sailors received their salaries for October last year in January this year. With soaring prices, a month's salary couldn't even buy three bowls of noodles. When the "Chongqing" warship returned to China, there was supposed to be a sum of money for the voyage, but it was all embezzled by Gui. Gui reported increased tonnage of ships every month, and most of the increased funds were pocketed by Gui. The various dark aspects of the Kuomintang Navy aroused the dissatisfaction of the navy soldiers, and Gui took strict measures to suppress them. A large number of officers and soldiers deemed unstable were imprisoned on Changshan Island. Eight people from the "Chongqing" warship alone were sent there.

　　The Bund in Shanghai is the World of American Warships
　　Last year, when the "Chongqing" warship returned to China and sailed to Shanghai, it could not even dock on the Bund and had to hide quietly in the Jiangmian area of Gaochang Temple in Nanshi. The reason was that it had not been approved by the American Navy authorities in Shanghai. All Kuomintang ports, especially the Jiangmian area of the Bund in Shanghai, had become the world of American warships and the Stars and Stripes. All Kuomintang port facilities and the movements of warships had to be reported to the Kuomintang American naval advisors every day. Americans attended and guided the Naval Headquarters' bi-weekly "bandit suppression reports." Last year, when one or two hundred people were freezing to death in Shanghai every day, the Naval Headquarters spent hundreds of millions of yuan on banquets for Americans. Gui's servile attitude towards American imperialism was beyond description. Gui usually arbitrarily beat and scolded the officers and soldiers on the ship, but he was respectful to the American military and saluted even a single American soldier. The person who told the reporter said that he personally saw Gui salute an American sailor with the number 444 first.

　　The Behind-the-Scenes of "Peace"
　　Just as the Kuomintang reactionaries were singing loudly about "peace," war criminal Gui Yongqing repeatedly announced to the navy that spring would be the time for the navy's major counter-offensive. He said, "We will use the power of the navy to stir up the angry tide of the Yangtze River." He ordered the Jiangnan Shipyard in Shanghai to rush to build fifty gunboats before May and to repair a large number of ships and amphibious tanks for the armored corps of war criminal Jiang Weiguo. In order to prepare for the final struggle, the Kuomintang Navy is actively building Changshan Island and training new recruits in Zuoying, Taiwan. All important naval materials and documents, along with Gui's private property, have been transported to Taiwan. A large number of middle and lower-ranking officers' families have also been transported to Taiwan as hostages. But no matter what method is used, the hearts of the majority of officers and soldiers in the Kuomintang Navy will be the same as those of the "Chongqing" warship's officers and soldiers and can no longer be moved to Taiwan.

　　拉开国民党海军黑幕的一角
    穆青
    “重庆”舰起义的员兵们和记者谈起国民党海军当局及战犯桂永清的腐败和罪恶时，有人笑着说：“我们把他的‘家珍’献出来，请你替他数一数罢！”
    把鱼雷发射器当做火箭炮
    战犯桂永清这位“海军总司令”不懂得什么叫做海军，只知道海军是他的私人财产。他把重要职位都送给亲戚朋友，过去在国民党陆军中跟过他的老部下，不管懂不懂海军，都穿上了海军制服，当舰长，当参谋。桂匪的一个侄子，一个内侄，一事不知，都当了海军警卫营营长。有一次国民党海军总司令部的大批高级将领到“重庆”号参观，竟把鱼雷发射器当作火箭炮，把扫雷具当做鱼雷，并大发议论，惹得全舰官兵事后大笑不止。桂匪的三个老婆和孩子们可以随便到海军总部和海舰上发脾气骂人。真正有才能的海军干部被排挤，只好离开军舰另谋出路，仅仅“重庆”号就有三分之一的人员愤然出走。
    六十箱人参
    完全不懂海军的“海军将领”们，对于走私、抢掠却非常精通。用军舰从重庆满载鸦片走私上海，这已经是惯例了。去年十月桂匪亲率旗舰去东北营口接应国民党残军撤退时，在营口葫芦岛一带海面把满载货物的民间帆船渔船抢劫一空。仅仅桂匪永清一人，就分到了六十箱人参。停泊在营口的“峨嵋”舰则一面用机枪扫射要求登舰逃命的陆军，一面紧张地搬运、查点抢来的财物。事后孝敬了桂匪一大注贼物，桂匪对这事大加赞赏。“峨嵋”舰就这样从一只油船变成旗舰，该舰舰长也从一个中尉一跃而为准将。
    一个月薪饷买不到三碗面条
    国民党海军水兵们去年十月份领的薪饷，到今年一月才发，在物价飞腾下，一个月的薪水还买不到三碗面条。“重庆”号回国时，按规定有一笔航海货，但全部为桂匪侵吞了，桂匪每月都呈报增加舰艇吨位，增加的经费大多被桂匪中饱。国民党海军中的种种黑暗，激起了海军士兵们的不满，桂匪采取严厉镇压。大批被认为不稳的员兵被关禁在长山岛上，仅“重庆”号即被送去了八人。
    上海外滩是美舰的世界
    去年“重庆”号回国驶向上海时，竟然不能在外滩停泊，只好冷清清的躲到南市高昌庙一隅的江面。原因是没有呈经上海美海军当局批准。国民党所有的港口特别是上海外滩江面已成为美国军舰和花旗的世界。所有国民党一切港口设备，军舰动态每天必须呈报国民党美海军顾问。海军总部每两周两次的“剿匪汇报”，都有美国人出席指导。去年上海每天冻死一二百人的时候，海总招待美国人的筵席动辄花费亿万元。桂匪对美帝国主义奴颜婢膝的丑态是无以复加的。桂匪平常虽动辄肆意打骂舰上员兵，但对美军却必恭必敬，哪怕对一个美国士兵也要敬礼。告诉记者的人说，他就亲见桂匪有一次对一个四四四号的美国水兵首先敬礼。
    “和平”的幕后
    正当国民党反动政府高唱“和平”的时候，战犯桂永清再三向海军们宣布：春天将是海军大反攻的时期。他说：“我们要用海军的力量掀起长江的怒潮。”他命令上海江南造船厂在五月以前赶造五十艘炮艇，大量补修船只及水陆两用坦克车，供给战犯蒋纬国的装甲兵团。为了准备作最后的挣扎，国民党海军正积极建设长山岛，在台湾的左营训练新兵。一切重要的海军物资文件连同桂匪的私产统统运台了。大批中下级官员的家属，也被当做人质般的运到台湾。但是不论用什么方法。国民党海军中多数官兵，他们的心会和“重庆”号官兵一样，是再搬不到台湾去了。
