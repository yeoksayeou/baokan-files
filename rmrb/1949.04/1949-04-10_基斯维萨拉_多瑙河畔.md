Kisvásár – On the Danube
    Ding Ling

    Editor's Note: Last December, the Chinese women's delegation participated in the Third World Women's Democratic Congress held in Budapest, Hungary. Comrade Ding Ling was one of the delegates. This article is a vivid portrayal of their visit to Kisvásár city and the warm friendship they received from the people of the city. We are now introducing it to our readers.

    (I)
    I'm not entirely sure how many cities and towns there are in Hungary, but on November 7th, mass rallies were held in fifty locations across the country to welcome the delegates attending the World Women's Congress.

    We made preparations in advance, dividing ourselves into four groups, each with a comrade who could speak English or Russian. Because none of us wanted to be deaf and mute, and the experiences of the past few days had been painful enough for those of us who didn't understand foreign languages. So we insisted on having a translator. We gave the list to Elizabeth, waiting to be assigned our regions, and urged them that we could only go to four regions. However, before we left, the guides came and split us up. They hoped we could go to more places, preferably one person to each location. We disagreed with this approach and all said we wanted to be with someone who could speak a foreign language. As we insisted, a Hungarian girl kept saying "Han Qimin, Kisvásár." We pointed out Da Han to her, and she was overjoyed, grabbing her to leave. But Da Han was also anxious, repeatedly asking, "Who's going with me? I should have a translator." Lao Ji and Wulan, who were originally scheduled to go with her, then decided to go to another place temporarily. At this time, no one wanted to give up their translator, no one wanted to go with her. Da Han kept asking anxiously, and the girl kept grabbing Da Han to leave. Without thinking, I stepped forward and said, "Da Han, I'll be your translator, let's go. It doesn't matter if we don't understand." At the same time, I said to everyone, "I think they're right, going to more places, even if we can't speak, it's good to let people see us." Everyone laughed and said, "Right, we support your spirit." What kind of translator could I be? The pidgin English I learned in my youth, I had long forgotten. I was indeed forced to be so brave.

    Two cars were waiting for us at the hotel entrance. Da Han and I sat in one car with the girl, and an American delegate and another Hungarian girl, who was acting as her translator, sat in the other. Our car took the lead and drove off. Da Han and I smiled at each other and said, "Now, it's all good. We'll listen to commands, our fate is sealed, let's be complete exhibits. We each have a small copper plate hanging on us, with the Hungarian word for 'China' written on it. We don't need anyone to introduce us, we can just point to the plate, 'China,' this is a Chinese person."

    The car didn't go far before stopping. We thought, "That's good, so close." The girl went down alone, entered a house, and after a while, brought out several blankets, giving one to the American and wrapping one around our legs. She also wrapped one around herself. "Ah, so it must be far. Good, we have to go even if it's far."

    The car crossed the Danube and drove out of Budapest. Da Han and I admired the scenery of the countryside. The road we were on was next to a railway track, sometimes on its right, sometimes on its left. Gradually, I tried to talk to the girl. I had already learned, or rather, invented, many ways to talk to people who didn't speak the same language. She told me her name was Lyuba. I was extremely happy because that name had belonged to a Soviet girlfriend. She was twenty-five years old this year, not yet married, and had parents and siblings. She took their photos out of her handbag to show me. She was a member of the Women's Association and a member of the Hungarian Working People's Party. We were going to Kisvásár, which was one hundred and fifty kilometers from Budapest. She asked us if we were Communist Party members. We didn't answer her, but she smiled very kindly. She might not look beautiful at first glance, slightly plump, but once you started talking, she seemed very enthusiastic, and you could tell she was very capable. The driver was a man in his thirties, and judging by his rough skin and hands, he was a worker, but his attitude was very gentle and dignified, like a professor or a musician. It's not easy to judge a foreigner's life and occupation using Chinese habits and standards. He occasionally participated in our conversation, sometimes they exchanged a few words, then looked at us, and then laughed again. We understood their good intentions and spoke to them, and smiled at them. These incomprehensible words must all be harmless and full of goodwill. The air outside the car was very cold, the scene was completely different from the capital. There was residual snow in the fields, and ice on the roadside, but it was very lively in the car, and we didn't feel cold at all. The pain of being deaf and mute that Da Han and I had anticipated had disappeared somewhere, and precisely because there was no translator, we talked even more. Even if there was someone who could speak English and Russian, what use would they be? Besides their own language, they could only understand the international language I had created. Instead, we had a lot of interest.

    We arrived at a town, and many women holding flowers blocked our car on the street, but we drove past. We understood that there was also a mass meeting in this place. Then we passed a big house, with banners and flags, probably as a venue for the meeting.

    (II)
    After driving for more than two hours, the car stopped outside a small restaurant in a large town. Lyuba asked us to go down. She told us, "The American is terribly cold. Shaking." We had to get out. The town seemed large, with buildings, many beautiful shops, and the asphalt roads were also very clean. The waiters in the small restaurant brought wine, very fragrant, sweet, and beautiful wine, and a plate of small sausages. They talked to us, asked about the situation in China, how we came, and how far away it was. They also asked us what "Xuzhou" was, hearing on the radio that the Communist army had occupied Xuzhou.

    The American representative was a Ms. in her thirties or forties, wearing a very large thin leather coat. The meaning of this coat was novel, the style was novel, but it couldn't keep out the cold. This Ms. was very delicate, and her legs in glass stockings were simply frozen stiff. She huddled by the fireplace, rubbing her hands and feet, and seeing Da Han's big leather boots, she kept saying, "So good, so good." She had been conquered by the cold and couldn't be interested in anything, as if staying in this restaurant was a good idea. But Lyuba and we were very anxious, we just waited for her to feel comfortable, and then urged her to leave again. In fact, we felt very sorry for her, her skin was very pale.

    The car drove for another hour before reaching its destination. We were surrounded and taken to a house, flowers piled all over us, some old ladies came over to kiss us, and after kissing us, they pulled their daughters or friends over to introduce them. They praised us to each other, and blamed each other for not letting us rest. The chairman of the Women's Association personally brought wine, and the tea table was filled with wine, two glasses for each of us, one red and one green. Everyone asked us to toast. I tasted a sip, like honey, but the honey didn't have such a clear fragrance, it was extremely delicious, almost like fairy dew. I drank a glass of green, and they persuaded me again, so I drank a glass of red. Thinking that a little bit of sweet water wouldn't matter, but immediately felt my face burning, it turned out to be very strong wine. Then another group of people poured in, some peasant women wearing headscarves also came. One of them, hearing that I was a Chinese representative, hugged me and started crying. I held her head and wiped away her tears. She told me like a child. I hurriedly pulled the translator of the American representative and asked her to translate a few sentences for me. Before she could speak, a very beautiful local woman came out. Her name was Lucy, and she told me the old lady's history in English. Her English wasn't very good, but I could barely understand it. She told me that the old lady had a son who was taken away by the Germans. The British then occupied the German area where her son lived. The British didn't release her son, but transported him to Indochina (Saigon). Therefore, as soon as she heard that I was Chinese, she thought of her son. She told me how brutal the German fascists were and how unreasonable the British were. I told her that our conference was against war, against fascism, against American imperialism, and against all reactionary elements. We must strive to bring his son back, to liberate the sons of the world. She hugged me tightly, shedding tears, and asked how the lives of Chinese peasant women were, and whether I had a son, and whether my son was in the army.

    A very simple but sumptuous lunch was set up in the big room outside. We went out to eat. There were about twenty people, a quarter of whom were men. After sitting down, the director of the Women's Association stood up to speak, expressing her welcome. After she finished, the mayor of Kisvásár also stood up. He was very tall and very dignified. He also said a few words of welcome. Lucy had already taken on the role of my translator. She was a teacher. I could hear that her English couldn't fully translate what others were saying, but she could say a general idea. I listened with a discount, but I could still understand a general idea. At this time, the American representative had warmed up. She stood up to thank and raised her glass to Wallace. Everyone stood up to drink. Da Han and I were anxious. Were we going to be fools? No, we didn't want to be fools, so I stood up and said, "Lucy, I'm going to say a few incomplete English sentences, please translate them well for me." She was extremely happy. For the first time in my life, I spoke in English, I said, "I am very happy to come to Kisvásár to see you all, I have unlimited enthusiasm, but I can't speak Hungarian, I can only say a few very pitiful English sentences, I want to simply tell you: First, thank you for your hospitality, Second, the Hungarian people and the Chinese people are the best friends, a family. Third, everything is good here, we are winning against Chiang Kai-shek. Fourth, Live! Rákosi!" As I spoke, I noticed grammatical errors, but my muscles were very relaxed, I didn't care at all, and the whole room laughed and applauded. The American representative also smiled with great interest. Da Han asked me what I said? I told her, and she asked Lucy if she understood, and then asked me again what she translated. I said I didn't know what she translated. If she didn't understand, it was her own fault! But Lucy said she understood completely. I could see that Lyuba liked me very much.

    Da Han took out several maps of the liberated battlefield and gave them to the mayor and the director of the Women's Association. We also asked Lucy to awkwardly translate for them. We also gave them several portraits of Chairman Mao, which made them extremely happy. They scrambled to look at them, but they didn't want to scramble to take them. They raised their glasses to wish Chairman Mao good health.

    (III)
    The location of the mass meeting was only five or six houses away. When we arrived, the venue was already full of people. We walked onto the stage from the crowd, also from the applause. The stage was not big, but it was decorated very solemnly and beautifully. The venue held about a thousand people, and there was a floor in the back half, which was also full. Nine out of ten people in the crowd were women, none were dressed too dazzlingly, and none were ragged or dirty. No matter where my eyes fell, on old or young, I always saw a pursed-lip smile, and a warm glance. They made me forget that I was in a foreign country, they made me forget that I didn't speak their language. I seemed to be participating in a mass meeting during land reform in the countryside. I was as unrestrained as I was in front of many people I knew best, especially since I had Lucy, who didn't leave me now. If she forgot to translate, Lyuba would urge her. Sometimes I could understand half, guess half, sometimes I could only understand a third, and the rest was up to guessing. But in any case, it was still better than the "international language" I had created.

    First, the director of the Women's Association gave a welcome speech, which was very simple, but very clear. It satisfied the masses very much. The second was a speech by the American representative. Third, it was the turn of the Chinese representative. Da Han insisted that I speak. I took out my speech and read it. This time Lyuba translated for me. Lyuba also had a translated speech, and our two speeches were exactly the same. We had prepared them the day before. It was a relatively complete speech introducing China, specially prepared for all the mass meetings, so even if she didn't understand my words, it didn't matter. I had divided it into paragraphs in advance, and after I finished reading a paragraph, she would also read this paragraph. We wouldn't be wrong. To be honest, when I started reading, I didn't have any emotion at all, because I clearly knew that except for Da Han, who could hear my pronunciation, all the sounds were meaningless, maybe it sounded like birdsong or something else. But after Lyuba read a sentence, the masses applauded warmly. She always received several non-stop applause after reading each paragraph. This atmosphere made me serious. When I was reading, even though they didn't understand, they listened very attentively and eagerly. I seemed to be thinking only about how to make my words understandable to them. I was very excited, and later I felt strange that I was so excited. But the masses were also like that. I couldn't describe their support for my speech. The news of the Liberation Army's victory, the concrete figures, became the reason for their cheers. I had previously said verbally that China's victory was also the victory of the world's democratic front. Until now, I realized deeply the joy that the people of the world held for the victory of the Chinese people. When I said more, I felt like I was talking about their victory.

    After the guests finished speaking, the hosts spoke one by one. The most noteworthy of these was the secretary of the Kisvásár Labor People's Party, who was a short man, also slightly fat. His speech was very inflammatory and poignant. He recounted the poverty and hunger of their lives under Fascist rule. Many old ladies took out handkerchiefs from their pockets to wipe their tears, and some used their headscarves to wipe them. This short man was like a ball of fire. He burned himself and scorched people's hearts. He denounced the makers of war. He said that those imperialists and Fascists were going to take away our husbands and sons again, take away our land and property. We can no longer be widows and orphans, we can no longer be beggars. We must defend our peace. The audience wiped away their tears again. They stared, clenched their fists. Although I didn't understand the entire content of what he said, his voice, his agitation, and the reaction of the masses made me feel the pain that the Hungarian people had suffered in the past, as well as their determination today. I applauded his speech along with the masses, shouting "Long live! Rákosi! Long live! Stalin!"

    After the speeches, it was time to give gifts, coming from one small area after another. They all walked onto the stage, reading out the dedications they had prepared. Several women were trembling as they read. I saw how much the piece of paper she was holding was shaking. They were too excited. Some people didn't say anything, they just hugged us forcefully, their faces full of smiles, and their eyes inlaid with tears. They piled the embroidery, bottles, baskets, and small wooden boxes they sent in front of us. Someone sent a pigeon. The pigeon was placed in a beautiful flower basket. The pigeon symbolized peace. Even more, someone sent a pig, an interestingly fat pig arching its mouth in a wooden box. It is said to represent happiness. The gifts piled up like a small mountain. I showed them to the masses one by one, and the masses applauded wildly. We had indeed never seen such exquisite and beautiful things, and we had never received so many gifts. They took out their most beloved things, which was indeed not a simple thing.

    The meeting ended at more than seven o'clock. It was already dark, and Da Han and I asked to go back, as we were afraid of delaying tomorrow's visit. But Lyuba didn't agree, just shrugged. Lucy told me we were sleeping here tonight. We didn't agree, and we found the driver. The driver also shrugged and smiled. He said the road was slippery and difficult to walk on. This was clearly a lie. The road was wide, with no ice or snow. The car had lights, so why couldn't it go? It was obviously a lie. I asked the American representative. She was very afraid of the cold. She didn't want to go back at night. Da Han was more anxious than I was. She often blamed me for not speaking to them in English, thinking I wasn't firm. But what could I do? I had no choice but to persuade Da Han to stay. Alas, not understanding the language, and having to stay here, how would we spend the night? As we were hesitating, Lucy invited us to dinner. We followed everyone to another house for dinner. As soon as we entered, we understood why they wouldn't let us go back. There was a big banquet here. More than a hundred people, Kisvásár's cadres, and famous figures were all here. The secretary of the Municipal Party Committee personally came over to greet us, placing us next to him, the mayor, and another elder. I praised his speech as very good, but he didn't agree, just blinked. Although this banquet was in the countryside, it was very grand. Kisvásár's music team and elementary school students performed many programs on the small stage. Lucy quietly pointed out to me that the music conductor with the long hair was her husband, who was a music teacher in a school. These programs included singing, dancing, and very short operas, very similar to our school's entertainment evenings. And I couldn't help but notice that some Hungarian girls were simply as beautiful as those in ancient foreign oil paintings. Although we were eating, we were overwhelmed with attention. All kinds of men, women, old, and young came to ask questions. Sometimes I felt my English was improving, and I remembered a lot of words, but sometimes I really couldn't understand. When I had no way, I had to use my "international language," which sometimes worked after all.

    They were indeed people who knew how to have fun, and they drank to their heart's content. Everyone was so friendly. The secretary of the Municipal Party Committee was completely unlike the way he was during his speech. He was extremely kind and humorous, constantly winking at you, and making dancing gestures to invite us. We couldn't dance. Later, they invited us too much, so Da Han sang a passage of Peking Opera. I told them this was Chinese classical Arabic (opera). They listened with great interest, because Da Han was singing in the old male voice. But if she were to sing in the female role, it would be even more surprising.

    Lucy told me in detail how the Hungarians moved here from the Tianshan Mountains more than a thousand years ago. She said that their ancestors were originally yellow people, Asian peoples, and were similar to the Chinese. Hungarians all like to talk to us about this matter. It is said that they were originally the Huns, and many Mongolian words still exist in the roots of their current language. Does this explain another reason why they especially like us?

    They started dancing the Hungarian dance again. Most of the people participated. Lyuba also pulled me to dance, so I had to follow them and play. But Da Han and I said goodbye to them at twelve o'clock and went to the residence. Later, I heard that they danced until four o'clock in the morning.

    (IV)
    Da Han and I studied our landlords. They had four small rooms. The living room was full of high-quality sofas and carpets, as well as various decorations. There were photos and paintings on the walls. We slept in their living room, on a temporary spring bed. The quilt was made of duck down, washed very clean, and they gave us two very beautiful nightgowns. The landlord was an old man and an old lady. The old man slept in a small room behind the dining room. I didn't see him until the next morning. The dining room was also decorated very delicately. I went to their small room and washroom. I couldn't see any old or rough furniture. This should be a middle-class or above family. They treated us to a very delicate breakfast. The old man wanted to talk to me in English, but I didn't know what he was saying. I couldn't understand a single word. It was true that he could speak German. Perhaps they were old and their minds were not flexible. I tried every means to make them understand what I meant, but I couldn't. I could only know that the old man's father was a professor of high standing. They were not a couple, but sisters. The old man's wife had died, and his son was disabled. They also led me to two small rooms next door to see his disabled son. The son lived in the kitchen. The kitchen was cleaned very neatly. It seemed like there was a servant. This family was probably richer. Da Han and I discussed going for a walk on the street to see if the other residents were also like this. It would be best to go to a farmer's family. We already knew that there were farmers in this town, and no factories. The workers were not here, or only their families were here. We said goodbye to the old lady and went to the street, refusing her company.

    The air on the street was very fresh. Few people were walking in the early morning. On some streets, the remaining snow had frozen into ice, making it difficult to walk, but there was always a small path on the sidewalk that people had walked out of. The houses on both sides were generally the same as the one where we lived. Each house had a small yard, with three or four rooms. There was a corridor outside the house, and you could see gauze or silk curtains hanging between the windows. The houses were very neat, and the paint was very good. It seemed like they were all affluent and cultured families. Some young women and men came out with bottles to fetch water, also dressed very neatly and with a calm attitude. When they got close, they said good morning to us. Da Han and I couldn't believe that their standard of living was so high. We were planning to break into any house to play when Lucy suddenly appeared. She grabbed us with joy as if she had seen a relative, and pulled us back to eat breakfast. I always felt it was a pity that she broke our plan, but a new plan was devised by me.

    I asked to see her children. She was very happy to hear that, but said that the children hadn't gotten up yet, and the house was messy, but in the end, she couldn't refuse our sincerity and brought us to her home. Her house also had three or four rooms. There was a good piano in her husband's room. Her eldest child had gone to school, the second was getting dressed, and there was a nanny. The little one was lying in bed, looking at us and smiling. The furnishings in her house were relatively poorer. But as a primary school teacher, we thought she was living very well.

    When we arrived at the Women's Association, everyone was waiting for us. They had also distributed, tied, and placed the gifts sent yesterday in the car. The two drivers had also danced all night and looked very energetic, telling us that the road was no longer slippery, and the car could go. I also smiled and told him that I had known all along that the road was not slippery at all, and I was glad that we didn't go back, because last night's meeting was very interesting.

    Everyone, the secretary of the Municipal Party Committee, the mayor, the director of the Women's Association, and some other people, couldn't bear to part with us, holding our hands tightly, hugging, and kissing us. Several old ladies cried again. Lucy often said to me, "Don't forget me! Don't forget Kisvásár!" The director of the Women's Association said, "Please go back and tell the Chinese sisters and women heroes that the women of our Kisvásár pay their respects to them and wish them good health. Let us peace-loving people join hands." The secretary of the Municipal Party Committee winked humorously again, like an old father, opened the car door, and helped us into the car.

    The car slowly drove forward, leaving the town in the following and waving of a group of people. We couldn't see them anymore, we couldn't see the streets anymore, but we would do as we had promised them: "We will never forget Kisvásár, and the deep friendship that the people of Kisvásár gave us. We must tell the Chinese people that your noble sentiment of defending peace will be an incomparable encouragement to us. Thank you, and we wish you victory in construction!"

    The return seemed faster and warmer than the arrival. Da Han was in a very good mood, and she almost sang all the way home. I also sang her the little tunes I had learned from the meeting, one by one. Lyuba and the driver kept giving us smiles and nods. The American representative's car broke down halfway, but we didn't wait for them. The driver also drove the car back to Budapest with the best interest, speeding like lightning.

　　基斯维萨拉—多瑙河畔
    丁玲
    编者按：去年十二月在匈京布达佩斯召开的世界民主妇女第三次代表大会时，中国妇女代表团曾参加了这次大会，丁玲同志是代表之一，这篇文章就是她们去参观基斯维萨拉市时，受到该市人民极浓厚的友情的写照。现特介绍出来，以飨读者。
    （一）
    匈牙利一共有多少城镇呢，我不大清楚，但在十一月七号这天全国有五十个地方同时举行群众大会欢迎出席世界妇女代表大会的代表们。
    我们预先准备好了，分成四个组，每个组里有一个会说英文或者俄文的同志。因为我们谁也不愿意当哑吧和聋子，而且这几天来的经验，已经使我们不懂外国语言的几个人够痛苦了。所以我们坚持着一定要有翻译。我们将名单给了伊利莎白，等候分配我们的地区，并且叮嘱她们，我们只能去四个地区。可是当临走之前，那些领路人来了，却将我们拆开，她们希望我们能多去几个地方，最好是一个人去一个地点。我们不同意这个办法，都说要和能说外国语的一道。这样坚持在那里，有一个匈牙利女孩子老说“韩启民，基斯维萨拉。”我们将大韩指给她，她高兴极了，抓着她就要走，可是大韩也急了，连问：“谁同我走呢，我应该有一个翻译呀。”本来拟定和她一道的老计和乌兰，却又临时决定到另一个地方去，这时谁也不想把自己的翻译让给她，谁也不想和她一道走，大韩急着老问，那个女孩子也急着抓住大韩要走，我当时也不做思考，挺身而出，我说：“大韩，我给你当翻译，咱们走，不懂话不要紧。”同时并且向大家说：“我以为她们的话是对的，多去几个地方，不会说，给人看看也好。”大家都笑了说：“对，拥护你的这种精神。”我能当什么翻译呢，年青时候学的一点洋泾滨英文，老早不知道忘记到什么地方去了。我的确是逼着没法才这末勇敢起来的。
    旅馆门口有两部小汽车等着我们。我和大韩，那个女孩子坐了一部，另一部是一个美国代表和另一个匈牙利的女孩子，她是充当她的翻译的。我们的车打头就开出去了。我和大韩相视一笑，说：“现在，好得很，一切听指挥，命运已定，当一次完完全全的展览品吧。我们每人身上挂得有一块小铜牌，上面写得有匈牙利文字的‘中国’，咱们也不必要人介绍，将牌子指给人看看好了，‘中国’，这就是中国人”。
    车子走了没多远，停下了，我们想：“倒好，这样近。”那个女孩子单独下去，走进一栋房子，一会拿出来了几条毛毡，送了美国人一条，拿一条盖在我们腿上，她自己也裹了一条。“啊，这样，一定很远，好，再远也得去。”
    车子走过多瑙河，走出了布达佩斯，我和大韩浏览着乡间的风景，我们走的公路，是在一条火车道的旁边，一时在它右边，一时又在它左边。慢慢地我就设法和那个女孩子交谈起来了。我已经学会，也可以说是发明，用很多方法同一个不通语言的人们谈话。她告诉我她的名字叫柳芭。我高兴极了，因为这个名字曾经是一个苏联女朋友的。她今年二十五岁，还没有结婚，有父母兄弟，她将他们的像片从小提包中拿给我看。她是妇女会会员，而且是一个劳动人民党的党员。我们是到基斯维萨拉去的，它离布达佩斯有一百五十公里。她问我们是不是共产党员，我们没有答复她，她却极亲切的笑了。她一眼看来也许不漂亮，稍微有点胖，但一谈开了，却显得非常热烈，而且看得出她是一个很能干的。车夫是一个三十多岁的人，看他的皮肤和手很粗糙，认得出是一个工人，但他的态度很文雅，很自重，象一个教授，或者象一个音乐家，用中国的习惯和尺度是不容易判辨一个外国人的生活和职业的。他偶尔也参预我们的谈话，有时他们俩人交换几句，说了以后又看看我们，跟着又笑了。我们懂得他们的好意，也说他们，也向着他们笑，这些无法懂得的言语，一定都是无伤的，和有许多好感。车外面空气很冷，情景完全和京城不一样，田间有余雪未化，路边上也有冰块，但是小汽车里却显得很热闹，一点也不感觉冷，我和大韩所预感到的聋哑的痛苦也不知消失到哪里去了，而且正因为没有翻译，我们才说得更多，纵然夹上一个会说英语和俄语的，又有什么用呢，他们除了本国话以外，就只能懂我所创造的国际语言，我们倒反而有了很大的兴致。
    我们走到了一个镇子，街上有很多妇女捧着花，拦住我们的汽车，但是我们却走过去了，我们懂得这个地方也有一个群众会。跟着我们走过一个大房子，那里有标语，有旗帜，大约是做为会场的吧。
    （二）
    走了两个多钟头，车子停在一个大镇子的小餐馆外面。柳芭请我们下去，她告诉我们：“美国人冷的不行。发抖呢。”我们只得下来。这个镇看来很大，有楼房，有很多漂亮商店，柏油马路也很干净。小餐馆里的侍者拿了酒来，很香很甜很好看的酒，又拿了一碟小香肠，他们和我们谈话，问中国情形，问我们怎么来的，相隔有多远。还问我们“徐州”是什么地方，听广播说共产军占领了徐州。
    美国代表是一位三四十岁的马丹，穿一件非常硕大的薄皮子大衣，这件衣服的意义是新奇，样子新奇，却不能御冷。这位马丹身体很纤弱，穿着玻璃袜子的小腿简直冻僵了。她偎依着壁炉搓着手和脚，看见大韩的大皮靴，连说：“真好，真好。”她已经被寒气所征服，对什么都不能发生兴趣，好象就在这个餐馆里住下去也不错似的。但柳芭和我们都很着急，我们刚等她觉得舒服了，就又催着她走了。其实我们心里也觉得她很可怜，她的皮肤很苍白。
    车子又走了一个多钟头才到达目的地。我们被簇拥着到了一间房子里，鲜花堆满了我们一身，一些老太太走过来吻我们，自己吻了之后，又把自己的女儿或者朋友拉过来介绍，她们互相说着赞叹我们的话，又互相埋怨没有让我们休息。妇女会长亲自捧了酒来，茶几上倒满了酒，我们每个人两杯，一杯红的一杯绿的，大家都请我们干杯，我尝了一口，蜜似的，但蜜却没有那样清香，好吃极了，简直象仙露，我干了一杯绿的，她们再劝，便又干了一杯红的。以为一点点甜水不要紧，但即刻觉得脸在发烧，原来是很厉害的酒呢。接着又拥进来了一批人，有些披大头巾的农妇也来了，当中一个听说我是中国代表，抱着我就哭起来，我扶着她的头，替她揩眼泪，她象个孩子似的，向我诉说起来了。我急忙拉那位美国代表的翻译，叫她翻几句给我听，她还没说，这时却走出来一个很漂亮的本地人，名字叫露西，用英文告诉我老太太的历史，她的英文不十分好，但我勉强能听得懂。她告诉我这位老太太有一个儿子，被德国人抓走了，英国人又占领了他儿子所住的德国地区，英国人不释放他儿子，却把他运到印度支那（西贡）去了。因此她一听说我是中国人，就想起她的儿子，她诉说德国法西斯是如何的残暴，和英国人如何不讲理。我告诉她我们这次大会就是反对战争，反对法西斯，反对美帝国主义，和一切的反动分子，我们一定要争取把他的儿子放回来，要解放全世界的儿子，她紧紧地抱着我，流着泪，问中国的农妇们的生活怎样，问我有没有儿子，我的儿子当兵没有。
    一顿极为简单而丰盛的午饭，摆在外面的大屋子了。我们出去就餐。约摸有二十多个人，四分之一是男的。就坐后，妇女会主任站起来说话了，致欢迎之意。她说完后，基斯维萨拉的市长也站起来了，个子很高大，极为庄重，他也说了几句欢迎的话。露西已经替我担任了翻译，她是一个教员，我听得出她的英文并不能把别人的话翻全，但他能说出一个大意，我又打折扣的听了下来，但也仍能懂得一个大意。这时美国代表已经暖和了，她站起来致谢，而且举杯为华莱士干杯。大家都站起来喝酒。我和大韩着急了，难道我们当傻子么？不，我们不愿当傻子，于是我也站起来，我说：“露西，我将说几句不完全的英文，你好好地替我翻吧。”她快乐极了。我有生以来第一次用英文说话了，我说：“我非常之高兴到基斯维萨拉来见到诸位，我有无限的热情，但我不会说匈牙利话，只能说几句非常可怜的英文，我要简单的告诉你们：第一，谢谢你们招待，第二，匈牙利人民和中国人民是最好的朋友，是一家人。第三，你们这里什么都好，我们打蒋介石胜利。第四，里雅！拉科西！”我一边说一边发现文法的错误，但我的肌肉却非常松弛，毫不在乎，满室的人都大笑鼓掌。美国代表也很有兴趣的笑着，大韩问我说了些什么？我告诉她，她又问露西懂得么，又回过来问我，她翻了些什么，我说她翻的我不知道，她要没听懂，活该！但露西却说她完全听懂了，我看得出柳芭很喜欢我起来了。
    大韩拿出来几张解放战场地图，送给市长和妇女会主任，我们又请露西胡里胡气的凑着翻译给他们听。又送了几张毛主席像给他们，简直把他们乐坏了。他们争着看，又不好争着要。他们举杯祝毛主席健康。
    （三）
    群众大会的地点离这里只隔五六家。我们到时会场上已经坐满了人。我们从人丛中，也是从掌声中走到了台上。台不大，装饰得却很庄严美丽。场子里约容一千人，后半截还有楼，楼上也坐满了。群众十分之九是妇女，没有打扮得太刺目的人，也没有褴褛或者不干净的人，不管我的眼光触到老的或者少的，总是看见一个抿着嘴的笑容，而且送来一个热情的秋波。她们使我忘记了是在外国，使我忘记了我和她们是不通语言的，我好象是在乡下土地改革时参加群众会一样，我是在许多我最熟识的人面前那样无拘束，何况我还有露西，她现在已经不离开我了，假如她忘了翻译，柳芭就会催促她，有时我能听懂一半，猜一半，有时只能听懂三分之一，剩下的就靠猜了。但无论如何，还是比我所创造的“国际语言”要好一些。
    首先又是妇女会主任致欢迎词，词很简单，但很清楚。使群众很满意。第二是美国代表讲话。第三又轮到中国代表了。大韩一定要我讲。我拿出我的讲演稿来念。这一次是柳芭替我翻译。柳芭也有一份翻译好的讲演稿，我们两份稿子一模一样，我们在头一天就准备好的。是一篇介绍中国的比较完整的讲演稿，专门为所有群众会而准备的，所以她虽然不懂我的话也不要紧，我事先分好了段，我念完一段，她也念这一段。我们不会错的。说老实话，我开始念的时候，一点情绪也没有，因为我明明知道除了大韩一人之外，谁也只能听到我的发音，所有的音都毫无意义，也许觉得象鸟叫或者象别的什么叫。但柳芭念完一句，群众就热烈的鼓掌，她每念一段总有几次不停的掌声。这种空气把我弄严肃起来，当我念的时候，她们虽不懂得，却非常注意的热切的听，我似乎只在想如何使我的话说得让她们懂得，我非常激动，后来想起来都觉得奇怪，为什么会那样激动的。可是群众也是那样。我无法形容她们对我的讲话的拥护，那些解放军的胜利消息，具体的数目字，都成为她们欢呼的原因，以前我口头上说过中国的胜利，也就是世界民主阵线的胜利，直到现在我才切身体会到世界人民对中国人民的胜利所抱的欢欣，当我再说下去的时候，我就好象是说他们的胜利一样的心情了。
    客人讲完以后，主人一个一个的讲，其中最使人注意的是基斯维萨拉的劳动人民党的市委书记，他是一个矮个子，也稍微有些胖，他的讲话非常煽动和沉痛，他历述在法西斯统治下他们生活的贫穷和饥饿，许多老太太都从口袋里掏出手绢拭眼泪，有的就拿头巾来揩，这个矮男人就象一团烈火，他自己燃烧着，又烧焦了人心，他痛斥战争的制造者，他说那些帝国主义，法西斯分子又要来夺走我们的丈夫和儿子，夺走我们的土地和财产，我们不能再做寡妇孤儿，我们不能去做乞丐，我们一定要保卫住我们的和平。听众又揩干了眼泪，她们瞪着眼，攒紧拳头，我虽不懂他讲的整个内容，但他的声音，他的激昂和群众的反映，使我也感受到匈牙利人民过去所受的痛苦，以及今天的决心，我和群众一样对他的讲演鼓掌不歇，而大呼“里雅！拉科西！里雅！斯大林！”
    讲完了话是送礼物，一个小地区一个小地区来的，她们都走到了台上，念她们所准备好的献辞，有几个妇女一边念一边发抖，我看见她拿的纸片颤得多厉害，她们为兴奋弄得太激昂，有的人什么也不说，只用力的拥抱着我们，脸上堆着笑，而眼里镶着泪珠把送来的绣花、瓶子、提篮、小木匣子堆在我们面前，有人送了一个鸽子，鸽子放在一个美丽的花篮里，鸽子象征着和平，更有送一个小猪，肥得有趣的小猪在木箱子里拱着它的嘴，据说它代表幸福。礼物堆积如小山，我一样一样的举给群众看，群众就疯狂的鼓掌。我们的确没有看见过这样精致和美好的东西，我们从来也没有接受过这样多的礼物。她们把她们最心爱的东西都拿出来了，这的确不是一件很简单的事。
    会开完七点多钟了，天色已暗，我和大韩便要求回去，我们怕耽误了明天的参观。可是柳芭不答应，只耸耸肩，露西告诉我今晚要睡在这儿。我们不同意，找到汽车夫，汽车夫也耸肩而笑，他说路上滑不好走。这话明明是假的，路很宽既无冰又无雪，车上有灯为什么不能走呢？显然是假话。我问美国代表，她是很怕冷的，她不愿晚上回去。大韩比我还着急，她常常责备我不用英文说给她们听，以为我不坚决，可是我有什么法子呢，只好劝大韩留下来，唉，又不懂话，还要住在这里，晚上将如何渡过呢？我们正踌躇的时候，露西约我们去吃饭，我们跟在大家后边又走到另一家去吃饭，一进屋我们就明白了她们为什么不放我们回去，这里正有一个大的宴会呢。足有一百多人，基斯维萨拉的干部，有名人物全集在这里了。市委书记亲自走过来招待，把我们安置在他和市长，以及另一个年长者一道。我称赞他演讲得非常好，他也不答应，只眨了眨眼，这个宴会虽然在乡下，却很隆重。基斯维萨拉的音乐队，小学生都在那个小舞台上表演了很多节目。露西悄悄指点给我看，那个音乐指挥，留了很长头发的就是她的丈夫，他正在一个学校里当音乐教员。这些节目有唱歌，有跳舞，有很短的歌剧，很象我们的学校里的娱乐晚会一样。而且我不能不注意，有些匈牙利女孩子简直只有外国古代油画上才有的那么美丽。我们虽然是吃饭，却应接不暇，各种各样的男女老少都跑来问长问短，我有时觉得我的英文提高了，想起了很多字，但有时我实在无法懂，我一没有办法就只好使用我的“国际语言”，究竟有时也生效力。
    他们的确是会娱乐的人们，他们都放怀畅饮。他们人人都那样的友好，市委书记完全不象刚才讲演时的样子，是一个极为和蔼，而且很幽默的样子，不时望着你眨眼，又做出跳舞的样子来邀我们，我们不会跳，后来她们邀得太厉害，大韩唱了一段京戏。我告诉他们这是中国古典的阿拉伯（歌剧），他们听得非常有趣，因为大韩唱的是老生嗓子，不过假如她要唱青衣，那会更使人吃惊的。
    露西安详的告诉我，一千多年以前，匈牙利人如何从天山搬到这里来，她说，她们的祖宗本来是黄种人，是亚洲民族，和中国是差不多的。匈牙利人都喜欢同我们谈这件事，据说她们本是匈奴族，现在的文字的语根中，仍存在着许多蒙古文，这是否说明她们特别欢喜我们的另一原因呢？
    他们又跳起匈牙利舞来了，大半的人都参加了，柳芭也拉着我跳，我只好跟着她们玩，但我和大韩到十二点就辞别了他们到了住处，后来听说她们一直跳舞到早晨四点钟。
    （四）
    我和大韩把我们的房东研究了一番，他们有四间小屋子，客厅里全是上等的沙发和地毡，以及各种摆设，墙上有照片有画。我们睡在他们的客厅里，是临时架的弹簧床，盖的被子是鸭绒的，浆洗得非常干净，并且给了我们两件很好看的睡衣，房东是一个老头子和一个老太太，老头子睡在餐厅后边一间小屋子，第二天早晨才看见他，餐厅里也陈设得很精致，我又走到他们的小屋和洗脸室，我看不到一件旧的粗的家具。这应该是一个中产以上的家庭。他们款待我们很精致的早点，老头子，想拿英文同我讲话，可是不知道他说的什么，我一个字也听不懂，他会说德文倒是真的。也许他们年老了，心里不灵活，我想尽方法也无法使他们懂得我的意思。我只能知道老头子的父亲是一个很有地位的教授，他们不是夫妇，是姊妹，老头子的妻子死了，儿子是残废，他们又引我到间壁两间小屋去看他残废儿子，儿子住在厨房里，厨房收拾得非常整洁，好象有一个佣人，这家大约是较有钱的一家。我和大韩商量到街上溜＠去，看看别的住户是否也是这样，最好能到一个农民家庭，我们已经知道这个市镇上有农民，没有工厂，做工的都不在这里，或者只有家属在这里。我们便辞别了老太太到了街上，而且拒绝了她陪送。
    街上的空气很新鲜，清晨很少有人走路，有的街路上残雪结成冰不很好走，但人行道上总有一条人走出来的小路，两边的房子和我们的住处那家，大体相同，每家都有一个小院子，有三四间房，屋外有走廓，窗户间都看得见垂有纱制的或绸制的帘帷，房子很整齐，粉刷都很好，似乎全是一个个生活很充裕、很有文化的家庭。有些年青女人和男人，拿个瓶子出来汲水，也穿得很整齐，态度很安详。走近时，便向我们道早安。我们和大韩总不能相信，他们生活程度这样高，正打算闯进任何一家去玩玩，露西忽然出现了。她象看见了亲人似的欢喜捉住我们，拉我们回去吃早点，我总觉得她打破了我们的计划觉得很可惜，不过一个新的计划又被我想出来了。
    我要求去看她的孩子，她听到果然非常高兴，不过说孩子没起来，屋子里乱七八糟，但结果她还是不好拒绝我们的诚意，把我们带到了她的家。她家也有三四间屋子，她丈夫的屋子里有一架很好的钢琴，她的大小孩上学去了，第二个正在穿衣，有一个保姆，小的一个睡在床上直望着我们笑。她家里的陈设都要比较差一些。但做为一个小学教员的生活，我们以为已经很不错了。
    到妇女会时，全都在等着我们，昨天送来的礼物，她们也替我们分配好，扎好，放到了汽车上，两个汽车夫昨夜也跳了一夜的舞，显得精神非常好，告诉我们说路上不滑了，汽车可以走，我也笑着告诉他，我早知道路途根本不滑，并且说幸喜没有回去，因为昨晚的会是很有意思的。
    他们全体，市委书记，市长，妇女会主任，和别的一些人，都舍不得我们，紧紧握着我们的手，抱着，吻着，有几个老太太又哭了。露西常常向我说：“不要忘记我！不要忘记基斯维萨拉！”妇女会主任说：“请你回去告诉中国的姊妹们和妇女英雄，我们基斯维萨拉的妇女向她们致敬，祝她们健康，我们爱和平的人们携起手来。”市委书记又幽默的眨着眼，象一个老爸爸似的把车门打开，照顾我们上车。
    汽车在一群人的跟随、挥手之中慢慢的驶向前去，离开了市镇，我们望不见他们了，望不见街道了，但我们会象我们答应她们的话一样：“永远不会忘记基斯维萨拉，和基斯维萨拉人民给我们的浓厚的友情。我们一定要告诉中国人民，你们的保卫和平的高尚的情绪，将是对我们的无比的鼓励，我们谢谢你，更祝你们建设的胜利！”
    回去似乎比来时更快和更暖和，大韩的兴致真好，她几乎一路唱着回家。我也把我听会了的小调，一个一个唱给她听。柳芭和汽车夫就不断的给我们以微笑，点首。美国代表的汽车半路上坏了，但我们并没有等她们，汽车夫也用最好的兴致把汽车开得风驰电闪的驶回了布达佩斯。
