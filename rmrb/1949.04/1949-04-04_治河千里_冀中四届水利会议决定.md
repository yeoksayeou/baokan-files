　　Harnessing the Rivers for a Thousand Li
  　Hebei Central Fourth Water Conservancy Conference Makes Decisions
    [Hebei Central Dispatch] The Hebei Central Administrative Office Water Conservancy Bureau recently convened the Fourth Hebei Central Water Conservancy Conference, attended by 257 water conservancy work cadres from various special districts, counties, and the Hebei Central Water Conservancy Bureau. The conference reviewed the water conservancy work of the past year and made special reports and discussions on this year's water conservancy construction outline (general river conditions and engineering plans for each river), irrigation and navigation projects, river embankment afforestation, and the organization and leadership of civilian workers. After the meeting, a complete engineering plan for this year was made and has been approved by higher authorities. The total length of this year's Hebei Central water conservancy project is 1,000 li, with 1 million cubic meters of earthwork, 1.4 million workdays, and a budgeted cost of 11 million jin of millet for labor and materials. In addition, 120,000 mu of land will be irrigated by canals, 500 li of navigation will be opened up, and 2.5 million trees will be planted on river embankments. The conference determined to strictly require engineering quality this year, stipulating that ramming work should generally account for one-third of the earthwork, requiring that general floods do not cause breaches, and that even cyclical floods can protect the hinterland between the Daqing and Ziya Rivers, and reduce floods in other areas. Labor is generally organized in the form of supporting the front lines of service, requiring a combination of technical cadres and foremen, and a combination of engineering benefits and the interests of the civilian workers. In order to strengthen the leadership of water conservancy work, the conference specifically proposed and discussed the issue of organizational structure. With the approval of higher authorities, it was decided to establish special district water conservancy offices, county water conservancy bureaus, and full-time or part-time water conservancy assistants in districts. The spring work headquarters for the six major rivers in Hebei Central will be organized and led by the respective special commissioner's offices, and work sections or construction offices will be established below the headquarters.
