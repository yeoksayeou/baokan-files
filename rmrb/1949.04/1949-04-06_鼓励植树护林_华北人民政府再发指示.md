　　Encouraging Afforestation and Forest Protection
  　North China People's Government Issues Another Directive
    [Our Newspaper's Dispatch] In order to carry out the afforestation and forest protection movement, the Agricultural Department of the North China People's Government has once again issued a directive to the administrative offices, provincial governments, and directly subordinate municipal governments. The original text of the directive is as follows: 1. Regarding the afforestation movement, specific plans have been made at the North China Agricultural and Forestry Conference. Currently, various regions are also organizing and mobilizing the masses to carry out afforestation under the slogan of "planting trees early to ensure survival." In order to make this work a conscious movement of the masses, more emphasis should be placed on forest protection and incentive policies. 2. The masses, through personal experience, deeply understand the benefits of afforestation. The main reason they still have doubts is fear of destruction. This has become the biggest ideological obstacle to carrying out the afforestation movement today. Although forest protection has been repeatedly proposed in the past, it has not become a habit of the masses due to insufficient implementation and lack of inspection. Currently, the government will not issue regulations for the time being. Local areas can emphasize protection and prohibit destruction through public announcements and meetings, and as much as possible, county and district cadres should specifically help villages formulate forest protection covenants, and designate special personnel to manage them. The covenant should solve the actual problems of the local area, without requiring lengthy provisions and overly harsh penalties, but it must be seriously implemented and must not become a mere formality. 3. Mobilizing the masses to protect forests must be combined with the masses' own interests. State-owned and publicly owned forests should allow nearby masses to carry out auxiliary production such as pruning, thinning, and digging medicinal materials according to designated methods and times. This will inspire and increase the masses' interest in actively protecting forests, and it will also be conducive to the growth of forests. 4. In many places, land reform has emphasized opposing destruction and restricting the masses' freedom to dispose of their trees, and logging must be approved by the peasant association. Now that land reform is complete, land rights and tree rights have been determined. If restrictions continue, it will affect the masses' interest in planting trees and even cause doubts. Therefore, restrictions should no longer be imposed to remove obstacles to the development of the afforestation movement. 5. Experience has shown that to carry out the afforestation movement, one should not only be satisfied with general appeals and arrangements, but must attach great importance to leadership and specific organizational work in order to guarantee the completion of the task. The status of afforestation and the establishment of nurseries in various places are expected to be reported by telegram at any time.

　　鼓励植树护林
  　华北人民政府再发指示
    【本报讯】为开展植树护林运动，华北人民政府农业部特再度指示各行署、省府及直属市府，指示原文如下：一、关于植树造林运动，华北农林会议上已作了具体计划，目前各地亦正在提倡早栽树保证成活的口号下，组织与动员群众进行植树造林，为了使这一工作形成群众的自觉运动，更应着重注意林木保护与奖励政策。二、群众由于亲身体验，深知植树造林的利益，其所以仍有疑虑，主要是怕破坏，这成为今天开展植树造林运动上的最大思想障碍，关于林木保护，过去虽曾一再提出，但因执行不够认真，和很少检查，致未能成为群众之习惯，目前政府暂不颁布条例，各地可用布告会议方法强调保护，禁止破坏，并尽可能的由县、区干部具体帮助村订立护林公约，并推定专人掌管，公约应当解决当地的实际问题，不须繁冗条文，和过于苛重的罚则，但要认真贯彻执行，勿使成为具文。三、发动群众护林，必须与群众本身利益结合，国有、公有林应允许附近群众按照指定办法与时间修枝间伐及进行刨药材等副业生产，这样才能启发与提高群众积极保护林木的兴趣，同时也有利于林木的成长。四、许多地方在土地改革中强调反对破坏限制群众对于其树木的自由处理，砍伐必须经过农会批准。目前土地改革完成，地权、树权等已确定，如继续限制，将会影响群众植树兴趣，甚至发生疑虑，故不应再予限制，以解除造林运动开展上障碍。五、经验证明，开展植树造林运动，不应只满足于一般号召与布置，必须十分重视领导与具体的组织工作，才能保证完成任务。各地植树造林的情形及设立苗圃情形，均望随时电告。
