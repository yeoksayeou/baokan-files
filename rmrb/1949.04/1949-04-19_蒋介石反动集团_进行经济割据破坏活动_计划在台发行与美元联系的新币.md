Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 18th. Reports from various sources indicate that the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary group is engaged in economic separatist sabotage activities. Bandit chieftain Chiang Kai-shek is still controlling the national treasury cash that has been transported to cities in South China and Taiwan. In order to prevent the pseudo-Central Bank from transporting silver dollars out of Guangzhou, Chiang Kai-shek's die-hard followers in Guangzhou dispatched troops on the 14th to prevent planes carrying silver dollars from taking off. The reactionary Guangdong Kuomintang authorities also plan to reprint and circulate pseudo-gold yuan notes, refusing to accept pseudo-gold yuan notes that have not been reprinted. Chiang Kai-shek's die-hard followers in Taiwan plan to issue new banknotes directly linked to the US dollar and refuse to link them to local currency. Pan Gongzhan, the pseudo-municipal speaker of Shanghai, also proposed on the 16th to issue a special Shanghai currency to replace the pseudo-gold yuan notes. The purpose of Chiang Kai-shek and his die-hard followers in carrying out these activities is to further undermine the people's economic life and use this as a preparation for a desperate military struggle.

　　蒋介石反动集团
  　进行经济割据破坏活动
    计划在台发行与美元联系的新币
    【新华社北平十八日电】据各方报道：蒋介石反动集团正在进行经济割据的破坏活动。匪首蒋介石仍在控制着已运至华南各城市及台湾的国库现金。为了阻止伪中央银行将库存银元运出广州，蒋介石在广州的死党曾于十四日出动军队，阻止载运银元的飞机起飞。广东国民党反动当局并计划将伪金圆券加印流通，拒绝未加印的伪金圆券行使，台湾的蒋介石死党则计划发行直接与美元联系而拒绝与本土货币联系的新纸币。上海伪市参议长潘公展亦于十六日提出发行上海的特别货币以代替伪金圆券。蒋介石及其死党进行这些活动的目的，就是在于进一步破坏人民的经济生活，并以此作为进行军事上绝望挣扎的准备。
