　　To Avenge Patriotic Compatriots Who Were Murdered
  　Trying Bandit Special Agents in Changchun
    [Xinhua News Agency, Changchun, 13th] The Changchun Garrison Command discovered sixty-seven corpses of murdered people in the courtyard of the former Kuomintang special agent organization's Inspectorate. The People's Municipal Government Public Security Bureau therefore held a trial a few days ago for the main Kuomintang Changchun special agents, including Chen Mu, the former Director of the Inspectorate's Interrogation Department, and Qu Pixi. According to their confessions, in addition to the above-mentioned corpses, there are still one hundred and eleven bodies that have not been unearthed. The victims were mostly young workers, students, journalists, and citizens who were dissatisfied with the Kuomintang's reactionary rule, and also included a small number of Kuomintang army deserters. Among the unearthing bodies, there are several former Changchun University students. The victims were all subjected to various tortures and then collectively executed in early October of last year, before the liberation of Changchun. When this news came out, and after the People's Municipal Government announced the list of victims one by one, people from all walks of life in the city were extremely angry. In recent days, family members of the deceased have gone to identify the bodies, and workers, students, and citizens from various factories and schools have also flocked to pay their respects. Currently, all sectors of the city have decided to hold a memorial service in the coming days, and demand the arrest of Chiang Kai-shek and other murderers for severe punishment, in order to avenge the countless murdered patriotic compatriots.
