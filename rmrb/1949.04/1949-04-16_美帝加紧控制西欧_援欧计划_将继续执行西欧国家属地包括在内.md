Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, 15th—In order to further strengthen its economic and political control over European countries, the U.S. Senate has passed a bill to continue the Marshall Plan. According to the U.S. Information Service in Washington, the Senate passed a bill on the 8th by a vote of 70 to 7, authorizing the appropriation of $5.58 billion for the United States to continue implementing "financial assistance" for the economic recovery of Europe over the next 15 months. The U.S. House of Representatives has not yet begun debating this bill. The bill submitted by the House Foreign Affairs Committee provides for a reduction of $200 million compared to the bill passed by the Senate. The Senate bill only approves the allocation of funds for the Economic Cooperation Administration from April 3rd of this year to June of next year, and actual appropriations must be approved separately.

Last month, on the 25th, the Economic Cooperation Administration established a new department "to assist countries participating in the Marshall Plan to promote the economic development of their backward territories." The establishment of this new department illustrates that after controlling the politics and economy of Western European countries, U.S. imperialism also intends to seize their interests in colonies and territories. The new department is headed by Barnaby, the former president of Johns Hopkins University. Cleveland, the director of the Economic Cooperation Administration's China Program Department, serves as the adjustment commissioner and continues to be responsible for aid to the Kuomintang reactionaries.

　　美帝加紧控制西欧
    “援欧计划”将继续执行西欧国家属地包括在内
    【新华社北平十五日电】为了进一步加强对欧洲各国的经济和政治控制，美国参议院通过了继续执行马歇尔计划的法案。据美国新闻处华盛顿讯：参院于八日以七十票对七票通过授权拨款五十五亿八千万美元，以便美国在今后十五个月内继续实行对欧洲经济复兴的“财政援助”。美众院对此项议案，尚未开始辩论。众院外委会所提出的议案，较参院所通过的议案规定减少二亿美元。参院的法案，仅为核准拨付经合总署本年四月三日至明年六月的基金，实际拨款须另案通过。
    上月二十五日，经合总署成立了一个新部门，“俾协助参加马歇尔计划各国，促进彼等落后属地之经济发展”。这一新部门的成立，说明美国帝国主义在控制了西欧国家本国的政治、经济以后，还要侵占它们在殖民地和属地中的利益。新部门由前任贺甫金斯大学校长巴曼主持。经合总署对华计划部门主任克里夫兰则为调整专员，仍兼管对国民党反动派的援助。
