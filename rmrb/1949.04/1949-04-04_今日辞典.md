　　Today's Dictionary
    "硪" (wò) - is a round stone weighing thirty to sixty catties, with a flat bottom and eight stone noses around it for tying ropes. The ropes are about eight feet long. When working, each person pulls on a rope, drawing the "硪" (wò) more than ten feet high, and then letting it fall to compact the soil. "硪工" (wò gōng) are workers who build dikes and pound the earth with the "硪" (wò). One "硪" (wò) requires eight workers. Farmers along the Yellow River are accustomed to using the "硪" (wò) due to the constant need to build and repair the Yellow River dikes. They sing "硪" songs together while working.
    Lying Fallow—is a method used by farmers to accumulate fertilizer. It usually involves enclosing sheep in the field overnight with wire mesh or hemp rope nets to allow their excrement to fertilize the land.
