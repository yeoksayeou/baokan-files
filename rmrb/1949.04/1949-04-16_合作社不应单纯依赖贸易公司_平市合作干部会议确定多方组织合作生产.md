　　Cooperatives Should Not Rely Solely on Trading Companies
  　Ping Municipality Cooperative Cadre Meeting Determined
    To Organize Cooperative Production in Multiple Ways
    [Ping Municipality News] The Ping Municipality Supply and Marketing Cooperative held a cadre meeting of employee consumer cooperatives from various factories (bureaus) and district branches yesterday (the 15th) to summarize their work. Comrade Wang Chun, director of the cooperative, stated in his speech that the cooperative had made achievements in guaranteeing workers' food supply. However, due to cadres' unclear understanding of the policy, such as regarding the cooperative as a mere shop for rationing food, they failed to mobilize the masses of members to find ways to run the cooperative well, and had the mentality of completely relying on the general cooperative and state-owned trading companies, which affected the cooperative's business. In the future, everyone must recognize that the cooperative is their own economic organization, and everyone should fulfill their responsibilities and find solutions. In the future, a variety of methods should be adopted in management, such as supplementary food, soy sauce, bean sprouts, flour milling, and organizing workers' families to raise pigs and grow vegetables. To assist each cooperative in better developing its business, the general cooperative has discussed with trading companies and other relevant agencies to make decisions to support the cooperatives: (1) To simplify the procedure for obtaining grain, the Grain Company will establish a cooperative wholesale section (preparing to establish a cooperative grain depot in the future). The cooperative can directly contact the section with a letter of introduction from the general cooperative. (2) Cooperatives have priority in obtaining good quality goods. (3) To take care of the financial difficulties of each cooperative, the trading company can sell goods to each cooperative on credit in advance (generally 4% lower than the wholesale price of the trading company), with a small settlement every five days and clearing the account within ten days (calculated at the price on the date of credit). The general cooperative also suggests that each cooperative can change the price when selling goods to members according to the rise and fall of the market price (the daily market price will be notified to each cooperative by the wholesale section the night before), and it is not necessary to stipulate a fixed price within ten days. (4) In order to ensure the quality of grain, future processing (i.e., grinding into flour) will be handled by each cooperative based on the address of the members selecting factories to sign contracts, and the cooperative will send people to supervise, so as to prevent some merchants from engaging in sabotage. (5) Transportation vehicles will be solved by each cooperative itself. If they do not have their own vehicles, they can notify the wholesale section in advance to prepare them, and the freight will be paid by themselves.

　　合作社不应单纯依赖贸易公司
  　平市合作干部会议确定
    多方组织合作生产
    【平市讯】平市供销合作总社于昨（十五）日召开各厂（局）及各区分社的职工消费合作社干部会议，总结工作。该社主任王纯同志发言中，肯定合作社在保证工人粮食上是有成绩的。但由于干部对方针认识不明确，如把合作社当成了单纯配售粮食的商店，未能发动社员群众大家想办法来办好合作社，而有完全依靠总社及国营贸易公司的思想，使合作社业务受到影响。今后必须使大家认识：合作社是自己的经济组织，每个人都应该尽责任，想办法。今后经营上应采取多种方式，如副食品、酱油、生豆芽、磨面，组织工人家属养猪、种菜等。总社为协助各社更好开展业务，特与贸易公司及其他有关机关商讨做出扶植合作社的决定：（一）为简便取粮手续，由粮食公司成立合作社批发科（将来准备成立合作粮库），合作社持有总社介绍信，即可与该科直接联系。（二）质量好的货物合作社有优先权取得。（三）为照顾各社资金困难，贸易公司可将物品预先赊给各社（一般低于贸易公司批发价百分之四），限期五天一小结，十天内清帐（按赊出日价格计算）。总社并建议各社：物品售给社员时，可按市价之涨落而变动（每日行情由批发科头天晚上通知各社），不必在十天内规定死的价格。（四）为保证粮食的质量，以后加工（即磨成粉）由各社根据社员住址选择工厂订立合同办理，并由合作社派人监督，以免某些商人从中捣鬼。（五）运输车辆由各社自己解决。如自己没有车，可预先通知批发科请代为准备，运费由自己付。
