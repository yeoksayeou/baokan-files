Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 26th. Chinese war criminal and American imperialist lackey Hu Shih, who set off for the United States on the 5th of this month, made absurd remarks in San Francisco on the 22nd, praising the Kuomintang reactionaries for rejecting the domestic peace agreement, and begging the United States for aid for the Kuomintang reactionaries. He said: "I believe that if the Chinese government proves its ability to resist communism, American aid will come without being asked." He also said: "The government still has a good navy and a strong air force, which, if used properly, will be a powerful reliance to prevent the Communists from entering South China." But the facts happen to contradict Hu Shih. One day before Hu Shih blindly touted that the Kuomintang's "strong navy and air force" could prevent the People's Liberation Army from entering South China, the powerful People's Liberation Army had already defeated the joint resistance of the Kuomintang's navy, army, and air force, and smashed the Kuomintang's thousand-mile defense line along the Yangtze River. The day after Hu Shih's speech, Nanjing was liberated. Hu Shih's remarks prove his blindness. Even though U.S. Secretary of State Acheson has already clearly announced that the Kuomintang is bound to perish and that the U.S. government can do nothing about it, Hu Shih, the admirer of the Kuomintang reactionaries and American imperialism, still wants to blindly brag. He desperately wants the Kuomintang to fight hard and the United States to save their lives.

　　美帝走狗胡适团紧眼睛吹牛
  　乞求美国主子救命
    【新华社北平二十六日电】于本月五日启程逃美的中国内战战犯和美帝国主义走狗胡适，二十二日在旧金山发表荒谬谈话，赞扬国民党反动派拒绝国内和平协定，并为国民党反动派乞求美国援助。他说：“余认为中国政府如证明其力能抵抗共产主义，则不待求而美援必自至。”又说：“政府仍有良好之海军与强大之空军，如使用得宜，将为阻止共党进入华南之有力倚恃。”但事实偏偏要和胡适作对，在胡适瞎吹国民党“强大海空军”可以阻止人民解放军进入华南的前一天，强大的人民解放军已经战胜了国民党海陆空军的联合抵抗，粉碎了国民党的长江千里防线，在胡适谈话的第二天就解放了南京。胡适的谈话证明他的盲目。虽然连美国国务卿艾奇逊都已经明白宣布国民党必然灭亡，美国政府对此毫无办法，国民党反动派和美国帝国主义的崇拜者胡适却还要闭紧眼睛吹牛。死活要国民党拼命，要美国救命。
