We firmly maintain that the Nanjing government must immediately fulfill Chairman Mao's eight peace conditions, break with Chiang Kai-shek and his diehards, and severely punish the perpetrators of the Nanjing Massacre.

The murderers of the people must be punished, and the blood of the martyrs will never be shed in vain. We, the youth of all liberated areas, pledge our full support to the righteous struggle of the students in Nanjing and all Kuomintang-controlled areas, to avenge the martyrs. We hope you will restrain your grief.
