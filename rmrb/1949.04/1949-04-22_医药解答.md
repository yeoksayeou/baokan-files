    Treatment for Measles—Measles begin like a cold, with chills and fever all over the body, headache, increased body temperature, sore muscles and bones, cold hands and feet, red eyes, tearing, coughing, and sneezing. These are the initial signs of measles. At this time, do not use extremely cold medicine, which will cause the measles toxin to freeze and prevent it from coming out, but also do not use medicine that is too hot. The most suitable is Ge Gen Shu Zhen Tang: Kudzu root, Cimicifuga, Perilla leaf, Peucedanum, Fructus Aurantii Immaturus, hawthorn, Chinese Angelica, Chuanxiong Rhizome, safflower, Cicada slough, pangolin scales, Angelica dahurica, Akebia, licorice, and coriander as a guide. After two or three days, the rash will appear in different colors such as red, purple-red, bright red, and dull. Some noses will bleed, some will have diarrhea-like yellow soup, and some will be in a coma. After another day, the feet will turn red, sneezing will decrease, and tearing will lessen. This is the second stage of measles. Do not let the patient drink cold water. If the rash color is purple-red, use purple gromwell, Akebia stem, Platycodon root, Lycium root bark, Anemarrhena, Cicada slough, Kudzu root, Cimicifuga, Scrophularia, peppermint, and licorice decoction. If the rash color is bright red, use Chinese Angelica, Chuanxiong Rhizome, hawthorn, Kudzu root, and Cimicifuga (red type), Angelica dahurica, Peucedanum, Fructus Aurantii Immaturus, and licorice decoction.
