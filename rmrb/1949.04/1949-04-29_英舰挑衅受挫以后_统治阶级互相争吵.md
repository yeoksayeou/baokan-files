　　After the British Warship Provocation Suffers a Setback
  　The Ruling Class Quarrels with Each Other
    The incident of British warships intruding into the Yangtze River and shelling the People's Liberation Army, and suffering a setback, has caused infighting within the British ruling class. The Conservative Party, led by Churchill, is using the incident to launch a major attack on the Labour government. They are attacking the Labour government as "foolish and irresponsible," causing the British Empire to "lose face and political prestige in the Far East," believing that the Secretary of State for Air and the First Lord of the Admiralty should bear considerable responsibility for this incident. These Conservative Party members, who harbor militaristic ideas, portray the British Empire as a lion, and so it seems to have really become a lion. Therefore, they particularly criticize the British government for failing to produce a sufficient number of aircraft or for distributing its air power too thinly around the world. It seems that with "sufficient aircraft" they could do whatever they wanted, showing that they are still dreaming. Several Labour members of Parliament joined in this attack. The Conservative Sunday Express published such attacks under the big headline "Who Made Britain Look Foolish." At the same time, the Labour government and Conservative Party members are attempting to use this incident to stir up anti-communist sentiment and divert the attention of the British people who are demanding peace and democracy. It is reported that the British First Lord of the Admiralty, Hall, paid tribute to those British sailors who were driven into the Yangtze River to carry out aggressive activities and made meaningless sacrifices, with the aim of "creating an atmosphere of national unity." However, most British people know that it was wrong for British warships to intrude into the Yangtze River and open fire. Several Conservative members of Parliament questioned Attlee as to why the British government sent British warships into this dangerous area while the north and south banks of the Yangtze River were at war. The liberal Manchester Guardian's editorial on the 25th, although containing some nonsensical remarks, believes that "now is not the time to sharpen knives, even if we (referring to Britain) have knives to sharpen." It also said: "The Kuomintang has brought about its own demise due to its own corruption, and we advise the West to accept the Chinese revolution and not make any useless gestures."

### 英舰挑衅受挫以后　统治阶级互相争吵

　　英舰挑衅受挫以后
  　统治阶级互相争吵
    【新华社北平二十七日电】英舰侵入长江炮击人民解放军受挫一事，引起了英国统治阶级内部的争吵。以邱吉尔为首的保守党，借题发挥，对工党政府大事攻击。他们攻击工党政府“愚蠢而不负责任”，使英帝国“在远东丧失体面和政治威望”，认为空军大臣和海军大臣对这次事件都应负相当责任。这些抱有黩武主义思想的保守党人，把英帝国说成狮子，于是好象真的变成了狮子。所以，他们特别指责英政府未能生产足量的飞机，或将空军势力分布世界各地，而表现过于单薄。似乎有了“足量的飞机”就可为所欲为，可见他们还是好梦未醒哩。若干工党议员参加了这个攻击。保守党的星期快报则以“谁使英国出丑”的大标题刊载了这一类攻击。同时，工党政府和保守党分子，企图利用这一事件，鼓动反共空气，转移要求和平民主的英国人民的视线。据息，英海军大臣霍尔之向那些被驱入长江进行侵略活动而无谓牺牲的英国水兵致敬，其目的即在“造成全国团结的空气。”但是，大多数英国人民都知道，英舰侵入长江开炮是不对的。若干保守党议员则诘问艾德礼，何以英政府当长江南北两岸正在作战之际，派英舰驶入此段危险地区。自由党曼德斯特卫报二十五日的社论，虽然有些不伦不类的话，但它认为：“现在不是磨刀霍霍的时候了，即使我们（指英国）有刀可磨的话。”又说：“国民党已因自己的腐化而自取灭亡，奉告西方，最好接受中国的革命，而不要作任何无用的表示。”
