(Jidong Electric Dispatch) With the financial assistance of the People's Bank, the wooden boat transport industry on the Luan River in eastern Hebei and the coastal fishing industry have gradually recovered. The Luan River starts from Chengde in the north and extends to Luan County, Leting, and even the estuary in the south, flowing through approximately one hundred li within Qianxi County (newly established county, formerly the western part of Qian'an County). Before the War of Resistance, there were over a thousand boat households with more than four hundred wooden boats in the county. For many years, due to the division and destruction by the Japanese invaders and the Kuomintang bandits, river transport was stagnated, many wooden boats were burned, most of the boat households lost their jobs, and their lives were extremely difficult. After the river opened this spring, the Qianxi County Bank issued loans of 140,000 yuan (Renminbi, same below) to poor boat households to help them repair their boats. It is estimated that five new boats can be built and twenty-eight old boats repaired to be launched for transportation, allowing mountain goods to be sold outside. Yanghekou Village in the fifth district of Funing County is close to the Bohai coast. This spring, the Funing County Bank issued loans of 180,000 yuan to help boat households and fishermen repair boats and mend nets. After each household began fishing, the method of "profiting and repairing at any time" was adopted to gradually restore production. Twenty-six old boats have now been repaired, fifteen of which are cargo ships traveling to and from the Daqing River to transport salt. Each ship can carry 45,000 jin of salt per trip, earning more than 64,000 yuan in freight. In addition to salt transport vessels, there are also twenty-eight fishing boats fishing at sea in the village.

[Another dispatch] Since the fishermen in eight villages in the Haibin District of Qinhuangdao City began going to sea this spring, the district government and the People's Bank have lent 22 bundles and 88 jin of yarn (for weaving nets) and 10,000 yuan in Renminbi to unemployed fishermen to help them restore production. Currently, 112 fishing boats in the district have gone to sea to fish.

　　冀东滦河与沿海地带
  　恢复船运渔业
    【冀东电】冀东滦河木船运输业和沿海捕渔业，在人民银行货款扶助下，已逐步恢复。滦河北起承德，南至滦县、乐亭以至海口，在迁西（新设县，原迁安县西部）县境内穿流约百里。抗战前，该县有船户一千余家，拥有木船四百余只。多年来在日寇及国民党匪帮分割摧残下，河运停滞，木船亦多遭焚毁，船户大部失业，生活异常困苦。今春开河之后，迁西县银行发放贷款十四万元（人民币，下同）贷给贫苦船户，帮助他们修造船只。预计可造新船五只和修补旧船二十八只下水运输，使山地货物得以外销。抚宁县五区洋河口村临近渤海岸，今春抚宁县银行发放贷款十八万元，帮助船户渔民修船补网。各户开始捕鱼后，采取了“随时得利，随时修补”的办法，逐渐恢复生产。现已修好旧船二十六只，其中十五只货船往返大清河运盐，每只一次可载盐四万五千斤，可赚运费六万四千多元。现该村除运盐船只外，并有二十八只渔船下海捕鱼。
    【又讯】秦皇岛市海滨区八个村的渔工今春开始下海以来，区政府及人民银行对失业渔工贷给洋线（织网用）二十二捆又八十八斤及人民币一万元，帮助他们恢复生产，现全区已有渔船一百十二只下海捕鱼。
