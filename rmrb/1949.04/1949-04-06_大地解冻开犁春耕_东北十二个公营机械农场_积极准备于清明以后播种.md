    Twelve State-Owned Mechanical Farms in Northeast China
  　Actively Prepare for Sowing After Qingming Festival
    【Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, April 4th】Spring cultivation preparations at the twelve state-owned mechanical farms in Northeast China are nearing completion and sowing will begin shortly. The four mechanical farms directly managed by the Agricultural Department of the Northeast Administrative Committee, namely Tongbei in Heilongjiang Province, Dong'an in Hejiang Province, Heshan in Nenjiang Province, and Masanjiazi in Shenyang, have repaired houses, roads, and bridges during the spring cultivation preparation period. Currently, they are disinfecting seeds and will begin ploughing for spring cultivation as soon as the land thaws. The aforementioned four farms have a total of 5,450 hectares of cultivated land and 52 tractors. In addition, the spring cultivation preparation work of the eight mechanical farms in the seven provinces of Songjiang, Hejiang, Nenjiang, Heilongjiang, Liaobei, Liaoning, and Jilin is also nearing completion. These eight farms have a total of 10,700 hectares of cultivated land and 108 tractors, as well as other new-style agricultural implements. Recently, the Agricultural Department of the Northeast Administrative Committee has supplemented a total of 140 tons of gasoline and 360 tons of kerosene according to the needs of each farm for tractor oil and fuel. At the same time, 310 tons of wheat seeds have been issued to ensure timely sowing after Qingming Festival. Currently, the trade unions of each state-owned farm have been established, and the production enthusiasm of agricultural workers is extremely high. The management policy of the state-owned mechanical farms in Northeast China this year is to implement enterprise management effectively, achieve the highest output at the lowest cost, and gain experience, train cadres, and gradually expand the mechanical farms in the process of operation.
    In other news: Northeast farmers Zhao Jinzhang and others, along with state-owned agricultural implement manufacturing factories, have created and improved many agricultural implements such as horse-drawn seeders and "Shovel Zhao" machines under the reward of the People's Government. Various new-style agricultural implements have been rushed into production in large quantities by agricultural implement factories in various regions and are being loaned to farmers by the democratic government in preparation for spring cultivation.

　　大地解冻开犁春耕
    东北十二个公营机械农场
  　积极准备于清明以后播种
    【新华社沈阳四日电】东北各地十二个公营机械农场的春耕准备工作将近结束，不久即可开始播种。东北行政委员会农业部直接经营的黑龙江省通北、合江省东安、嫩江省鹤山和沈阳的马三家子等四所机械农场，在春耕准备期间修理了房舍、道路桥梁，目前正在进行种籽消毒，只待土地解冻后，即可开犁春耕。上述四处农场，共有耕地五千四百五十垧，拖拉机五十二台。此外，如松江、合江、嫩江、黑龙江、辽北、辽宁、吉林等七省的八所机械农场，春耕准备工作亦将结束。这八所农场共有耕地一万零七百垧，拖拉机一百零八台，并有其他新式农具。最近，东北行政委员会农业部已按照各农场拖拉机油脂、燃料的需要程度共补充汽油一百四十吨，煤油三百六十吨。同时又发出小麦种籽三百一十吨，以便清明过后及时播种。现各公营农场的职工会已成立，农业工人的生产情绪极高。今年东北各公营机械农场的经营方针，是确实施行企业化的管理，做到以最低的成本达到最高的产量；并在经营过程中取得经验，培养干部，逐步扩展机械农场。
    又讯：东北农民赵锦章等和公营农具制造工厂，在人民政府奖励下创制和改造了马拉播种机，铲赵机等许多农具，各种新式农具已由各地农具工厂大批赶造，并由民主政府贷给农民准备春耕使用。
