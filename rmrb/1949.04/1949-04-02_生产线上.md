　　Production Line
    ★ After liberation, the workers of the Nankou Railway Bureau Machinery Plant, braving the cold wind and sweating profusely, worked enthusiastically. After completing the production of 150,000 railway spikes on February 19th, they have recently plunged into a surge to produce 2,000 railway fishplates. The workers overcame the difficulty of insufficient raw materials, made extensive use of scrap rails, and rushed out 327 pieces in three days.

    ★ Anxin County began to divert water from Baiyangdian to open canals from the beginning of spring. The county party committee, the county head and deputy county heads, and the head of the agricultural science section personally went to guide the work. Up to now, two old main canals have been repaired, with a length of twenty-three li; one new canal has been opened, with a length of four and a half li; six old branch canals have been repaired, with a length of forty-two li; and many small water canals have been opened. Currently, 18,000 mu of land have been irrigated. In the process of repairing the canals, opening canal committees have been established in forty-three villages, and they are being established in twenty-five villages.
    　　　　　　　(Liu Yintong)
    ★ More than forty women in Baima Village, District Three, Yi County, organized themselves to prune pear tree branches and scrape pear tree bark, completing 320 trees in three days. There are many pear trees in the village, which is one of the important sources of income for the villagers. However, in previous years, they suffered from insect pests, which caused great harm. This year, scraping the pear tree bark early to prevent insect pests should result in a good harvest.

　　生产线上
    ★南口铁路局机厂的工人们，在解放以后，冒着寒风，汗流满面地热情地工作着，他们自二月十九日完成了十五万个铁路道钉生产后，近又卷入突击铁道夹板两千块的热潮。工人们克服了原料不足的困难，大批利用了废铁轨，三天就赶出了三百二十七块。

    ★安新县从初春开始，即着手从白洋淀引水开渠，县委、正、副县长、农业科长亲自前往指导。截至目前已修整旧干渠二道，长二十三里；开新渠一道，长四里半；修整旧支渠六道，长四十二里；使水小渠开辟甚多。现已浇地一万八千亩。在修渠过程中，健全了四十三个村的开渠委员会，正在建立者二十五个村。

    ★易县三区白马村四十余妇女，组织起来修理梨树柯枝，刮梨树皮，三天完成三百二十棵。按该村梨树甚多，是村民副业重要收入之一。但往年时遭虫害，为害颇大。今年提早刮梨树皮，预防虫害，当可丰收。
