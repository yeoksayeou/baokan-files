Xinhua News Agency, Yangtze River Front, April 27th: The People's Liberation Army entered the city of Danyang late at night on the 23rd. Residents of the city welcomed them with lanterns, and gasoline lamps hung on the main streets, illuminating them as bright as day. Over a thousand students who gathered to greet them were particularly enthusiastic. They sang songs such as "Welcome the People's Liberation Army" and "We'll Follow You." They proudly told the PLA soldiers, "We've learned these songs a long time ago, and we've been waiting for you to come!" That evening, the reporter went to the telephone bureau and spoke with nearby cities. When connected to Zhenjiang, before the reporter could speak, the female telephone operator in Zhenjiang said excitedly, "Zhenjiang has been liberated, has Danyang been liberated?" When the reporter told her that she was speaking to a reporter accompanying the PLA, her laughter could be heard immediately. When speaking with Nanjing, the operator said anxiously, "The People's Liberation Army has not yet entered the city." When the reporter told her that the PLA was advancing towards Nanjing and hoped that they would continue to serve and protect the equipment, she immediately told her colleagues loudly. Then a burst of laughter came from the telephone. They all scrambled to talk to the reporter: "Come quickly, we will definitely guard the equipment and not let it be damaged!"

Xinhua News Agency, Yangtze River Front, April 27th: Order is excellent after the liberation of Jiangyin. The electric light company has never stopped supplying electricity. The day after the liberation, workers went out to inspect and repair the lines along the streets. All the male workers of the Li Zeng Yarn Factory, which employs over a thousand workers, remained in the factory, and the female workers are gradually returning to the factory. Students of the Provincial Nanhua Middle School organized a school protection committee before the liberation. The school was not damaged, and a meeting was held yesterday to discuss the resumption of classes. Zhengcun Middle School and Chengjiang Middle School have resumed classes as usual. All 48 employees of the post office and telecommunications bureau, including the director, are working as usual. City telephones are working smoothly. The long-distance telephone lines that were damaged by the Kuomintang have been restored to Wuxi, and communication with Jiangbei is being repaired. Mail delivery is as usual. The Cheng (Jiangyin) Xi (Wuxi) highway was reopened to traffic on the 26th.

　　丹阳人民提灯迎接解放军 　 高唱“跟着你走”！
    江阴解放后秩序良好！
    【新华社长江前线二十七日电】人民解放军在二十三日深夜进入丹阳城，城内居民都提灯欢迎，通衢大街挂着汽油灯，照耀如同白昼。结队迎候的千余学生情绪尤为热烈。他们高唱着“欢迎解放军”、“跟着你走”等歌曲。他们骄傲地向解放军战士们说：“我们早已学会这些歌子了，早等着你们来哩”。记者当晚即到电话局与附近城市通话。接通镇江时，记者尚未开口，镇江的女接线生首先以兴奋的语调说：“我们镇江已解放了，丹阳解放了么？”当记者告诉她与她通话的正是解放军的随军记者时，立刻听到她的欢笑声。与南京通话时，接线生焦急地说：“解放军还没有进城”，当记者告诉她解放军正向南京开进，希望她们照常供职，保护器材时，她立即大声转告左右的同事。接着从电话中传来一片欢笑声。她们都争着与记者通话：“你们快来吧，我们一定看守器材，不让破坏！”
    【新华社长江前线二十七日电】江阴解放后秩序良好，电灯公司始终未停止送电，解放后第二天工人即出动检查与修理沿街线路。拥有千余工人的利缯纱厂全体男工留厂未动，女工赤正陆续回厂。省立南华中学的学生在解放前即组织护校委员会，该校未受损失，昨已开会讨论复课。征存中学与澄江中学已照常上课。邮局与电讯局自局长以下全体职工四十八人照常工作。市内电话畅通，被国民党破坏的长途电话已可通至无锡，与江北通话正在修复。邮递照常。澄（江阴）锡（无锡）公路已于二十六日恢复通车。
