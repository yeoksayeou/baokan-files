Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant Power Plant
　　Assists "Ji Electric" in Supplying Electricity to Beijing

　　[This newspaper dispatch] The Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant's power plant is helping the North Hebei Electric Power Company supply electricity to the city by repairing machines ahead of schedule. The plant's repair work was originally scheduled to be completed by "May 1st" to cooperate with the opening of the No. 1 blast furnace for power supply; however, because the No. 15 boiler of the North Hebei Electric Power Company's Shijingshan Power Plant needed to be repaired, it requested the iron and steel plant to help generate electricity in advance. The plant then convened a meeting of engineers, construction workers, and foremen on the 3rd to discuss mobilization. The workers unanimously guaranteed to strive to generate electricity on the 15th, and formulated a specific plan to start a sprint. Boiler repair workers also volunteered to work night shifts. After such intense work, all departments completed the plan ahead of schedule. In terms of generators, the inspection of the 3,200-kilowatt generator was originally scheduled to be completed on the 11th. In terms of the boiler room, the inspection of the large and small gate valves and auxiliary machinery on boilers No. 1 and No. 2 was originally scheduled to be completed on the 10th, and the temporary ash discharge channel was scheduled to be completed on the 14th; however, all departments had completed the work by the 8th. The furnace was warmed up in the afternoon, a test run was conducted on the 9th, and electricity can be supplied to the city on the 11th. (Chi)

  　协助“冀电”供给平市电力
    【本报讯】石景山钢铁厂所属电力厂提前修复机器帮助冀北电力公司向城内供电。该厂修复工作原定“五一”完成，配合第一号炼铁炉开炉送电；但因冀北电力公司石景山发电所第十五号锅炉要整修，要求钢铁厂提前帮助发电。该厂乃于三日召集工程师、工务员、领班等开会商讨动员，职工们一致保证争取在十五日发电，并订出具体计划，开始突击。锅炉修理工并自愿开夜班突击。经过这样紧张工作，各部门均提前完成了计划。发电机方面，原定十一日将三千二百千瓦发电机检查完。锅炉房方面，一、二两号炉上的大小截门及附属机件检查原定十日完成，临时出灰道预定十四日完成；可是八日各部门都已完工。下午即开始温炉，九日试车，十一日即可向城内发电。　　　　　　　　　（炽）
