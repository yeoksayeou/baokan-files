　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 9th: TASS reported on the 6th: Unemployment in the United States is constantly increasing, and due to overproduction and decreased demand, the wave of unemployment has spread to almost all industrial sectors. According to government statistics, 3.75 million people were unemployed in the United States in March, and 9.5 million people were working part-time. Compared with February, the number of unemployed people in March increased by 557,000. Progressive labor unions believe that the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the US Department of Labor has underestimated the actual number of unemployed workers in the United States. According to the figures of the Electrical Workers' Union, there are currently more than five million unemployed workers in the United States. The Associated Press pointed out: In all industrial sectors, a continuous increase in unemployment can be seen, and unemployment affects all major industrial centers in the United States. According to newspaper reports, there were 750,000 unemployed workers in New York State in mid-March, of which 442,000 received unemployment benefits. In Pennsylvania, 332,000 people received unemployment benefits in mid-February. In New Jersey, which has 150,000 unemployed workers, older workers and black people will be laid off first. On the railways, 100,000 workers have already been laid off, and it is expected that 200,000 will continue to be laid off. According to union figures, the US textile industry has reduced production by 20%, and workers in the clothing industry only work three or four days a week. Workers in Massachusetts shoe factories work 22 to 28 hours a week. With the number of unemployed people increasing daily, the director of the US Bureau of Labor Statistics announced that unemployment benefits in the United States can only be short-term.
　　The Central Committee of the American Progressive Party pointed out in its special statement that unemployment is increasing, and the government has not taken measures to stop it. The statement also recommended the immediate adoption of large-scale public works programs and the implementation of a unified federal unemployment insurance system to achieve an actual increase in unemployment benefits. The Progressive Party called on state party departments to establish committees responsible for helping unemployed workers.

　　美国缩减生产五百万人失业
    【新华社北平九日电】塔斯社六日讯：美国的失业在不断地增加着，而且由于生产过剩和需求减少，失业浪潮已经扩展到几乎所有的工业部门里。据政府统计，美国在三月中有三百七十五万人失业，九百五十万人做部分时间的工作。与二月相比，三月份的失业人数增加了五十五万七千人。进步工会方面认为美国劳工部的劳工统计局缩小了美国失业工人的实际数字。根据电力工会的数字，美国现有五百万以上的失业工人。美国报联社指出：在一切工业部门里都可以看到失业不断增加的趋势，而且失业影响着美国所有的大工业中心，据报纸消息称：三月中纽约州有失业工人七十五万人，其中四十四万二千人领取了失业补助金。二月中宾州有三十三万二千人领取失业补助金，在现有失业工人一十五万人的新泽西州，年老工人和黑人将首先被解雇，在铁路上，已有十万工人被解雇，而且预期将有二十万人继续被解雇，根据工会方面的数字：美国纺织工业已减产百分之二十，被服工业中的工人每周工作仅三、四日，麻萨诸塞州制鞋厂的工人每周工作二十二至二十八小时，在失业人数日增的情况下，美国劳工统计局局长却宣布，美国对于失业工人的补助金，只能是短期的。
    美国进步党中央委员会在其特别声明中指出，失业在增加，而政府并未采取措施以制止之。声明并建议立即通过大规模公共工程计划，而且实行单一的联邦失业保险制度，以求失业补助金的实际增加。进步党号召各州党部设立委员会，负责帮助失业工人。
