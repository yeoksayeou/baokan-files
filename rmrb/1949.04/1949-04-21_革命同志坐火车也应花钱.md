　　Revolutionary Comrades Should Also Pay for Train Travel

To the Editor:
    I have a question that I would like answered. When revolutionary comrades were working in the countryside, they would say, "Comrades, work hard! When we capture the cities, we won't have to pay for train tickets." Now we have driven away the enemy, occupied the big cities, and taken over the trains. Didn't our comrades risk their lives to get these trains? Why do we still have to pay for tickets? Where would our comrades get the money?

Comrade Zhou Ziyu:
    The main point of your letter is that since the railway belongs to the country, public officials should not have to pay for train tickets. You also mention that comrades who have left production to participate in the revolution are provided with food and clothing by the state and have no money.

    Yes, the railway is a large-scale enterprise organization run by the state. Running the people's railway means serving the people wholeheartedly, serving the Liberation War, and serving the national economy of the liberated areas. Therefore, in railway management, there must be a certain income based on the fare standards approved by the state, and transportation costs must be reduced through precise calculations to maintain railway expenditures and seek development. It also has a responsibility to formulate systems to ensure that other state organs and enterprises calculate as precisely as possible when transporting materials and personnel, to prevent waste. For example, if a state enterprise or organ wants to transport something, its负责人 (person in charge) must estimate how to save money and how to waste money. If he spends too much money, his office is responsible for checking his work. The practice of transporting goods or having revolutionary cadres and miscellaneous personnel ride trains for free has been experienced in the Northeast Railway and the railways inside the customs today, and it has resulted in a great waste of national resources. In the past, many people often traveled by train for no important reason, simply because they could ride for free, which affected revolutionary work. If train travel costs money, these unwanted phenomena will disappear.

    For all legitimate official business trips or transportation of materials, agencies or troops will approve budgets and reimbursements. Therefore, Article 4 of the "Provisional Regulations on Military Transportation by Railway" promulgated by the Chinese People's Revolutionary Military Commission states: As the People's Railway gradually gets on the right track, past free preferential treatment and other methods will be abolished.

### 革命同志坐火车也应花钱

专栏：询问与答复

　　革命同志坐火车也应花钱编辑同志：
    我有一件事情请给答复一下。革命同志们在乡村工作时，谈到“同志努力呀！日后打到城市里边去，坐火车不用花钱。”到现在把敌人打走了，咱们也占了大城市，也把火车得过来了，这个火车不是咱们同志拿命换来的吗？为什么还叫同志们花钱打票呢？咱们同志哪有这笔钱？
　　　　　唐山市四区职工会周子舆周子舆同志：
    你的中心意见，是说铁路是国家的，所以公家人乘火车就不必花钱，而脱离生产参加革命的同志，吃饭穿衣都由国家供给，也没有钱。
    是的，铁路是国家经营的大规模的企业组织。办人民铁路就是全心全意为人服务，为解放战争服务，为解放区的国民经济服务；那么在铁路管理方面，必须在国家批准的收费标准（运价）下有一定的收入，经过精密的计算，减低运输成本，以维持铁路支出，并进而谋求发展。它也有责任制定制度，以使国家其他机关企业运送物资及人员时尽量精密计算，防止国家浪费。譬如某一个国家企业机关要运送东西，他们的负责人就要预计一下怎样运可以省钱，怎样运就浪费。若他多花了钱，他们的机关便有责任检查他的工作。运东西或革命干部杂勤人员搭车不花钱的办法，在东北铁路和今天关里各铁路都体验到对国家浪费非常大。过去有很多的人往往没有多大重要事情，只因为坐火车可以不花钱，便随便的坐着走了，影响了革命工作。如果坐火车花钱的话，这些不应有的现象就会消灭。
    凡是正当的因公出差或运输物资，机关或部队都会准许作预算和报销的。因之咱们中国人民革命军事委员会颁布的“铁道军运暂行条例”第四条说：人民铁道逐渐步入正轨，过去免费优待等办法即予废除。
