　　Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region Wheat Fields
　　Most Hoed and Harrowed Once
　　[Hebei-Shandong-Henan Dispatch] In order to guarantee increased wheat production this year, many counties in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region have already hoed the majority of their wheat fields once. Qingfeng County proposed guaranteeing that all wheat would be hoed once in their production plan. In Chengguan District of that county, there are a total of 14,164 mu of wheat fields this year. According to statistics from half a month ago, over 17,000 mu have been hoed. In that district, those who have hoed their wheat twice account for 15 percent of the total wheat hoed. According to judgments by local leading organs and experienced farmers, each mu can increase production by two jin after hoeing. The entire district can increase production by a total of more than 28,000 jin. One district in Neihuang County reported statistics. The entire district planted more than 32,000 mu of wheat. According to statistics from half a month ago, among them, more than 14,000 mu have been hoed once, and 11,000 mu have been harrowed once. The total area hoed and harrowed is more than two-thirds of the total wheat field area. This district is a sandy land area, and farmers previously had no habit of hoeing wheat. This year, most fields have been hoed and harrowed once. From this, it can be seen that the production enthusiasm of the general public has greatly increased, and old production habits are also being broken quickly. In addition, in Nanle, Puyang, Weihe, and most or part of the areas under the jurisdiction of the Second, Third, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, and Ninth Special Districts, a widespread wheat hoeing movement has been formed. This is of great significance for increasing wheat production this year.

　　冀鲁豫麦地
  　大部锄耙一遍
    【冀鲁豫电】为保证今年麦子增产，冀鲁豫区不少县已作到大部锄麦一遍。清丰在生产计划中，曾提出保证所有麦子锄一遍。该县城关区今年共有麦地一万四千一百六十四亩，据半月以前统计，用锄一万七千余亩。该区麦锄两遍者，达锄麦总数的百分之十五。据该地领导机关及富有经验之农民判断：锄麦之后，每亩可增产二斤，全区合计可增产二万八千余斤。内黄县第三区一个区统计。全区共种麦三万二千余亩，据半月前统计，其中锄一遍者一万四千余亩，耙一遍者一万一千亩，锄耙合计二万六千余亩，占全部麦地面积的三分之二以上。该区为一沙土地带，以往农民无锄麦习惯，今年做到大部锄耙一遍。于此可见一般群众生产积极性已大为提高，陈旧的生产习惯也很快的被打破。此外、南乐、濮阳、卫河及二、三、四、五、六、七、九专区所属大部或一部地区，皆曾普遍形成锄麦运动。此对今年之麦粮增产，实具重大意义。
