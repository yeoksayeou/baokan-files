　　Ping City News: The Huabei Water Conservancy Commission has issued the following instructions to ensure the successful completion of the plan, as spring construction has already begun in some areas and is being prepared in others:

　　(1) Strengthen Organizational Leadership: Spring construction generally involves repairs to existing infrastructure, with only a few new projects. Therefore, after the plan is drafted, technical work is not a major issue during construction. The key to strengthening project quality, improving work efficiency, and completing the project on time lies in organizational work. Local leading authorities must scientifically organize time and manpower, put forward project requirements, and establish a mass inspection and acceptance system and a construction reporting system to ensure the thorough, timely, and accurate completion of the project.

　　(2) Conserve Manpower and Materials: Based on past experience, serious waste of materials and manpower has occurred due to insufficient preparation before construction and the lack of a strict, planned approach to completing work, as well as thorough supervision and inspection. Some areas even prioritize completing tasks over ensuring project quality. The above practices are extremely detrimental to our requirements for this year's and future construction and must be resolutely overcome. Therefore, a formal system must be established for the transportation, use, and storage of materials. The use of manpower must take into account the agricultural season. Workers' travel, work, and rest must be managed by dedicated personnel. Conserving manpower and materials does not mean lowering project standards or quality, but striving to achieve these goals while adhering to project principles.

　　(3) Strengthen Education for Civilian Workers: Spring construction is a project that involves the mass mobilization of the people. It is essential to inspire the masses to consciously and willingly do the project well, instill the spirit of ownership, link the interests of civilian workers with the interests of the project, and coordinate the development of heroic model campaigns. Establish reward and punishment measures, and develop revolutionary heroism. A purely supervisory approach is not very effective.

　　(4) Closely Integrate Administration and Technology: For each project, the project requirements and preparations must be thoroughly communicated and deployed to unify the thinking of cadres. Engineering cadres tend to focus on the overall interests of the project while neglecting the smaller interests of the masses, while administrative cadres tend to focus on the smaller interests of the masses while neglecting the overall interests of the project. These phenomena are both one-sided views of the masses and are incorrect. Unless it is absolutely necessary to sacrifice small interests to serve larger interests, we must take into account the overall interests of the masses. River management is not simply a technical task; it requires strong administrative leadership to be done well. The establishment of spring construction headquarters in various rivers in Jizhong, combined with the Party and government, is a very good organizational form and can be used as a reference for other areas.

　　(5) Project Accounting: Upon completion of each project, an accounting report must be prepared. Each river affairs section should first report to the special district office, and the Yellow River levee maintenance section should first report to the levee maintenance office for preliminary review and sign their opinions before reporting to the River Affairs Bureau (or Water Conservancy Bureau) and the Yellow River Commission. Implement a zero-reporting, zero-write-off system. If river construction materials are purchased collectively and it is difficult to report separately, they may be reported and written off collectively after the completion of each project. When reporting the accounting, supporting expense receipts must be attached (to be retained after review by the Bureau/Commission, and subject to random checks by the Commission if necessary). The River Affairs Bureau (or Water Conservancy Bureau) and the Yellow River Commission should submit the spring construction accounts to the Commission by the end of June, listing the budgeted and calculated figures for each grain-consuming unit by river and classifying them by work type for comparison and review. Please report the progress, experience, and lessons learned from construction in various areas at any time and report on them in the newspapers.

### 华北水利委员会发布　关于春工施工问题的指示

　　华北水利委员会发布
  　关于春工施工问题的指示
    【平市讯】现各地春工，有的已经开始施工，有的准备施工。为保证计划之胜利完成，华北水利委员会特发出指示如下：
    （一）加强组织领导：春工一般是在旧有基础上，加以修补新修工程是少数的。因此，计划拟定后，在施工过程中技术工作不是很大的问题；而工程质量能否加强，工作效率能否提高，能否到时完工，组织工作，则是决定的环节。各地领导机关，必须科学地组织时间人力，提出工程要求，建立群众性的检查验收制度，施工报告制度，以做到工程彻底，按期准确地完成。
    （二）节约人力物力：根据已往经验，由于施工前准备不足，施工中又缺乏严格的按计划完成工作及周密的督促检查的正规作风，以致在材料人力的使用上，都存在着严重的浪费现象；甚至有的地区不要求工程质量，有单纯完成任务的观点。以上作风，对我今年及以后施工的要求，都是极端有害的，必须加以坚决克服。因此对材料的运输、使用、保管，必须建立一套正规制度；对人力的使用，必须注意农时。工人走路、做工、休息，必须有专人负责管理。节约人力物力，不是在降低工程标准，工程质量上想办法，而是在坚持工程原则下，努力以求。
    （三）加强民工教育：春工是一个大量发动群众的工程，必须启发群众自觉自愿地把工程做好，灌输主人翁的思想，把民工利益与工程利益联系起来，配合开展英模运动，订出奖惩办法，发展革命英雄主义，单纯的监工观点，收效是不大的。
    （四）行政与技术密切结合：每一工程必须把工程要求，工程准备，深刻地传达布置，打通干部思想。工程干部交易重视工程大的利益，而忽视群众小的利益；行政干部容易重视群众小的利益，而忽视工程大的利益。这些现象都是片面的群众观点，不正确的，必须做到非不得已时，舍小利服从大利外，要兼顾群众全面利益。治河工作不单纯是技术工作，必须有行政上大力领导，才能做好。现冀中各河设立春工指挥部，与党政结合，这一组织形式很好，可供各地参考。
    （五）工程计算：每一工程结束，即造报计算。各河务段先报专区办事处，黄河修防段先报修防处，进行初步审核，签具意见，然后报河务局（或水利局）黄委会。采零报零销制度。各河工材料，系集体采购者，在分报有困难时，得于各工程完竣后，合并报销。报计算时，必须附有开支单据（局会审查后留存，本会必要时抽查）。各河务局（或水利局）及黄委会，春工计算于六月底造报本会，以河为单位，表列各用粮机关的预算数，计算数并按工分类，分别造报，以便比较审查。各地施工进展情形、经验教训，希随时具报，并要在报纸上多作报导。
