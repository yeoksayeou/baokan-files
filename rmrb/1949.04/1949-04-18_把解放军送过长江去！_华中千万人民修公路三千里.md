Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 16th: Ten million people in Central China are working day and night to repair railways and highways and build bridges to pave the way for the southward advance of the People's Liberation Army. A thousand railway workers on the Jinpu Railway are actively carrying out repairs under the slogan "Extend the railway to Pukou." Although the Kuomintang army severely damaged the railway when they fled, and enemy planes constantly harassed them, the workers repaired four bridges in six days. When building Bridge No. 178, the original plan required 6,000 workdays, but after collective research by workers and engineers, it was completed with only 600 workdays. Farmers in Jingjiang Houhe and Jianghua districts voluntarily contributed 47 dan of iron, and blacksmiths worked day and night to rush-produce iron nails, solving the material difficulties in railway construction. After receiving the road construction notice, more than 9,000 laborers from four districts, including Taixian Da＠, rushed to repair the road overnight. The laborers shouted: "Work harder! Today we are building the road to victory and the bridge to victory, to send the People's Liberation Army across the Yangtze River and liberate all of China!" In one and a half days, all the laborers repaired the entire 60-li Jiang (Yan) Huang (Qiao) highway. Currently, 3,000 li of highways have been repaired in the沿Jiang area of northern Jiangsu, and 969 bridge holes have been built. Farmers along the road have organized road protection teams to ensure that the highways are always smooth and facilitate the southward advance of the People's Liberation Army.

　　把解放军送过长江去！
  　华中千万人民修公路三千里
    【新华社华中十六日电】华中千万人民正日夜抢修铁路公路，架设桥梁，为南下解放军铺平前进道路。津浦路千名铁路员工在“把铁路修到浦口去”的口号下，积极进行抢修，虽然国民党军逃跑时曾对铁路进行了严重破坏，敌机并不断骚扰，员工们在六天内便修好四座桥梁。在修筑一七八号桥时，原计划需工六千个，后经工人和工程师的集体研究，仅用六百个工即告完成。靖江候河、蒋华两区农民自动献铁四十七担，铁匠们日夜赶制铁钉，解决修筑铁路的器材困难。泰县大＠等四个区接到修路通知后，连夜有九千多民工赶来抢修，民工们高喊：“加油干呀，今天筑的是胜利路、胜利桥，把解放军送过长江去，解放全中国。”一天半内，全体民工即将六十里长的姜（堰）黄（桥）公路全都修好。现苏北沿江地区已修好公路三千里，造桥九百六十九孔，沿路农民纷纷组织护路小组，保证公路经常平坦，便利解放军南进。
