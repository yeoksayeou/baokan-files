　　Workers Welcoming the "May Day" Holiday
　　"May Day" Brand Valve Core
　　▲ The Beijing 409 Automotive Factory successfully trial-produced valve cores (used for inflating tires, previously imported) and carburetors. This is a "May Day" gift the workers planned in advance. They named the valve core the "May Day" brand and have already produced six boxes. They unanimously decided: first send two boxes to our Chairman Mao, so Chairman Mao's car can use the valve cores we made. (High-speed steel)

　　Clean the Locomotives a Little More
　　▲ The Beijing Xizhimen area railway locomotive section regularly cleans the locomotives very thoroughly and repairs them to be very sturdy. They also plan to repair a "May Day" locomotive before "May Day" to welcome "May Day". Workers in the inspection section decided to produce 1,135 brake shoes and other items before "May Day". Workers at the iron factory in the engineering section used to make 70 spikes a day, and now they have increased to 80 a day. (Gong Yunhan)

　　Repair the Planer
　　▲ Old worker You Chongjin of the Second Department of the Second Institute of the Beijing 70th Ordnance Factory, under the call of "welcoming May Day with practical actions," completely repaired a planer that was considered scrap iron during the Kuomintang era on the 21st. (Huang Wenliang)

　　One Day's Work Completed in Three Hours
　　The delivery section of the Dongying office of the Beijing Telecommunications Bureau used to need about 200 sheets of paper per shift, but now it uses less than 100 sheets. The workers voluntarily extend their working hours by one hour each day to clean dormitories, offices, and the newsroom. Telegram deliveryman Wang Keliang delivered 105 telegrams from 7:00 AM to 10:00 AM, which used to take a whole day. When He Baoming's team of 13 from the line section was rushing to repair the obstacle in the Dongchangan Street underground well of the Fifth Bureau, they worked for 14 hours a day, temporarily installing electric lights in the underground well at night to change the lines and check the repairs, quickly restoring communication. (Dongying Communications Group, Lei)

　　"Zhangjiakou" Locomotive to Depart on May Day
　　▲ The Zhangjiakou Railway Bureau's locomotive section has launched a May Day upsurge. All the staff of the section polished all 23 locomotives very brightly. They named the "PF" type No. 1505 as "Zhangjiakou" and prepared it for departure on May Day. Young driver instructor Wei Guodong enthusiastically designed the decorations for the "Zhangjiakou," so busy that he sometimes forgot to eat. (Zhu Fengchi)

　　Make a Hydraulic Electric Welding Machine as a Gift for May Day
　　▲ After Chen Guihua, an electric welder at the Zhangyuan Inspection Section, successfully trial-produced welding rods and received commendation from the Zhangjiakou Railway Sub-bureau, his labor enthusiasm increased even more. Recently, he made a hydraulic electric welding machine as a gift for "May Day." (Xu Zheng)

　　Process for one hour a day
　　▲ All employees of state-owned factories in Baoding City unanimously decided that from the 18th to the 25th, for the purpose of welcoming "May Day", each factory would carry out a production campaign week. During this week, an hour to an hour and a half of working time is generally increased.

　　Ten-Day Plan Completed in Three Days
　　▲ All public enterprises in Shijiazhuang City are implementing the spirit of the city's first workers' congress, actively preparing for the "May Day" competition ideologically and materially. The railway machinery factory adjusted wages, evaluated professional titles, stipulated work standards, and deliberated on competitions based on the workers' congress. Daxing Yarn Factory and Yumin Industrial Company have established short-term training classes to discuss issues such as democratization of enterprise management and labor discipline. The electric light company added a connecting line to ensure the power supply for each factory during the "May Day" competition. With the efforts of the employees, the ten-day plan was completed in three days.

　　The Same Number of People Shipping More Goods
　　▲ Employees of various factories and mines in Tangshan are launching competitions to welcome "May Day." Employees of Tangshan Steel Plant rushed to produce 300 tons of shell tail steel in the first half of this month, delivering the goods to a certain ordnance factory ahead of schedule. They decided to complete another 300 tons before "May Day". The Qinghua and Steel Wire Department of Huaxin Yarn Factory recently broke previous production records. The "Xin" and "Hua" classes of Qinghua, with 32 people, used to produce 350 rolls before liberation, and more than 400 rolls only by adding three hours of overtime every day. Now, without adding machines or working overtime, they produce 440-450 rolls every day.

    把机车擦干净些
    ▲北平西直门地区铁路机务段，经常把机车擦得很干净，修理的很坚固。并预定在“五一”以前修出一台“五一号”机车，来迎接“五一”。检车段的工友在“五一”以前决定打造出一千一百三十五个闸瓦仟和其他物品。工务段铁工厂的工友以前每天做七十个道钉，现在增加到每天作八十个。　　　　　（龚云汉）

    同样的人数出货增多了
    ▲唐山各厂矿职工正展开竞赛，迎接“五一”。唐山制钢厂职工，在本月前半月突击生产了三百吨弹尾钢，提前向某兵工厂交货。并决定在“五一”前再完成三百吨。华新纱厂清华、钢丝部，最近产量突破以往纪录，清华间“新”、“华”两班三十二人，解放前出卷三百五十个，每天加三小时班，才出卷四百多。现在不加机器不加班，每天出卷四百四、五十个。
