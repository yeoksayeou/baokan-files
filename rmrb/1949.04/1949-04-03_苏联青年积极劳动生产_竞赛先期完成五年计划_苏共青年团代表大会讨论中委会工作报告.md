Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 1st: TASS reports: The 11th Congress of the All-Union Leninist Young Communist League (Komsomol) convened day and night on the 30th to hear and discuss the supplementary report by Central Committee Chairman Mikhailov and the report by Central Auditing Commission Chairman Krivtsov. The delegates' speeches cited many moving facts about Soviet youth completing the Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule. In Moscow city and oblast, nearly 100,000 young people have completed their five-year production plans. The youth of the oblast have also decided to complete the electrification of all collective farms in the oblast next year. In Ukraine, nearly one million young people are participating in the competition to complete the plan ahead of schedule. Young Komsomol members in Uzbekistan have decided to turn 150,000 hectares of barren land into fertile fields.

　　Vavilov, Chairman of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, paid tribute to the congress and explained that science, once it becomes the science of the people, that is, when science serves the people and is supported by the people, becomes a powerful tool. He said that before the revolution, there were only a handful of scientists, but today there is an army of more than 100,000. The vast majority of these scientists come from the masses of the people. Many such scientists have emerged from the Youth League.

　　Representatives of youth organizations from Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Bulgaria all offered congratulatory messages to the congress. Figuères, Secretary-General of the French Youth Union, paid tribute to the congress on behalf of the French Republic Youth Union and stated that the working youth of France will use all means to ensure that the sinister schemes of the instigators of a new war can never be realized.

　　The congress adjourned after the chairman announced many congratulatory telegrams from all parts of the Soviet Union and the world and read out the congratulatory telegram from the World Federation of Democratic Youth.

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 2nd: Moscow dispatch: The 11th Congress of the All-Union Leninist Young Communist League (Komsomol) continued its session on the 31st. Selivanov, Secretary of the Central Committee of the League, delivered a report on the work of the Credentials Committee.

The ethnic composition of the delegates reflects the unbreakable friendship of the various nationalities of the Soviet Union. They include forty-four nationalities.
