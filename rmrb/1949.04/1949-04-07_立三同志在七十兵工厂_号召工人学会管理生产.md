　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 6th: Comrade Li Lisan, Vice-Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, and others held a forum with worker representatives at the 70th Ordnance Factory a few days ago. In his speech to the workers, Li Lisan first explained that the All-China Federation of Trade Unions is an organization that represents the interests of workers across the country. The primary interest of workers across the country is to ensure the victory of the people's democratic revolution nationwide and to develop production. The working class is the leader of the new democratic country and must learn the skills of managing production and managing the country. He said: The All-China Federation of Trade Unions has just moved to Beiping and does not yet have a good understanding of the situation here. I hope everyone will offer more suggestions. At the meeting, worker representatives spoke enthusiastically, raising suggestions for improving some of the factory's unreasonable phenomena. A worker representative from the gun repair department suggested that the procedures for obtaining materials were too cumbersome, delaying production. Another worker representative pointed out that there were too many idlers in the department and could be greatly reduced. Several representatives criticized several employees who oppressed workers. Many representatives also made many good suggestions on worker welfare issues, such as opening worker canteens and bathhouses, increasing worker dormitories, and establishing schools for worker's children. Finally, in his speech, Li Lisan praised the workers for their enthusiasm in caring for the factory and proposed that the factory should establish a workers' representative meeting and a factory management committee, and the workers' suggestions on improving production methods and improving living conditions should be discussed with relevant parties to gradually find solutions.

  　号召工人学会管理生产
    【新华社北平六日电】中华全国总工会副主席李立三等，于日前到七十兵工厂召开工人代表座谈会。李立三在向工人讲话中首先说明中华全国总工会是代表全国工人利益的组织。全国工人的利益首先就是使人民民主革命在全国范围内取得胜利和发展生产。工人阶级是新民主主义国家的领导者，必须学会管理生产和管理国家的本领。他说：全国总工会刚迁到北平，对这里情况还不很了解，希望大家多提意见。会上工人代表热烈发言，对工厂的一些不合理现象提出了改进意见。修炮部工人代表提出领材料手续太繁多，耽误生产。另一位工人代表指出该部门闲人太多，大可减少。几位代表对几个欺压工人的职员提出批评。许多代表对工人福利问题，如开辟工人饭堂和澡堂，增加工人宿舍，设立工人子弟学校等，也提出了许多好的意见。最后李立三于发言中称赞工友们热心爱护工厂，并提出工厂要成立工人代表会和工厂管理委员会，工友们提出的关于改进生产的办法和改善生活的要求，当与有关方面商量逐渐地求得解决。
