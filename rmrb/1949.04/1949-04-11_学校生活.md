    Tsinghua University Distributes Relief Supplies to Children in Surrounding Villages
    ▲ The Tsinghua Children's Welfare Committee recently distributed a batch of supplies originally issued by the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration to children in villages surrounding Tsinghua University. Currently, 400 weak rural children and infants have received milk powder, butter, rice, and other nutritional products. Furthermore, with the recent outbreak of smallpox, whooping cough, and other epidemics in various villages, the committee has decided to organize and train students to go to the villages to vaccinate children against smallpox.
    In addition, the Tsinghua Family Women's Association has successively established a tofu workshop, sewing department, vegetable stall, consignment department, and reading group. Recently, they plan to pilot a nursery and prepare for a rural women's literacy class. (Tsinghua Communications Group)
    Si Cun School Requests Renaming as "Ninth Middle School"
    ▲ After Si Cun Middle School was taken over, the students were very happy. All associations automatically brushed revolutionary slogans, and red and green paper was plastered everywhere. Recently, the students requested the comrades who took over to change Si Cun to "Ninth Middle School," and a cheerleading squad chanted loudly, "Through, through, through, hoping Si Cun becomes Ninth Middle School." This situation is rarely seen in Si Cun, which has always been called "Confucius Temple." (Kai)

Also, the First Branch of the school is scheduled to conduct physical examinations for students admitted in the first and second rounds of the second term of that branch today and tomorrow at the original North China College.

Preparations are now complete, and enrollment has begun. (Fu Jen University Communications Group)
