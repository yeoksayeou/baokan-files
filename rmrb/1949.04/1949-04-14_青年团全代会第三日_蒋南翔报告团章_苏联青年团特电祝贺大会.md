　　Third Day of the National Congress of the Youth League
  　Jiang Nanxiang Reports on the League Constitution
  　Soviet Youth League Sends Special Telegram to Congratulate the Congress
    [Our Dispatch] Today was the third day of the First National Congress of the China New Democratic Youth League. There were 352 representatives in attendance, including six newly arrived representatives from the First Field Army. In the morning, Jiang Nanxiang, representing the presidium of the congress, gave a report on the constitution of the China New Democratic Youth League. The report was divided into four parts. The first part was an explanation of some of the revisions to the draft constitution. He pointed out that the draft constitution of the League, published by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on January 1st of this year, served as a guide for the establishment of the League nationwide. Based on the experience of establishing the League in various regions over the past year and the development of the current revolutionary situation, it is necessary to make some revisions to that draft. However, the fundamental spirit of the draft constitution remains unchanged, which is to educate youth with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, so as to make them powerful assistants and reserve forces of the Party. The second part was an explanation of the nature of the China New Democratic Youth League. He pointed out that the Youth League is a mass organization of advanced youth, led by the Communist Party of China, guided by the proletarian ideological system, based on young workers, young peasants, and young revolutionary intellectuals, uniting advanced youth from all walks of life, and striving for the thorough realization of new democracy. He particularly pointed out that the experience of the Chinese revolution over the past thirty years has proven that only the Communist Party consistently cares for, leads, and educates the broad masses of youth. It has also proven that only under the leadership of the Communist Party of China can youth achieve progress and development. The third part of the report explained the fundamental organizational principle of the Youth League—democratic centralism. It pointed out that the League constitution reflects both a full spirit of democracy and a high degree of centralism. He elaborated that the relationship between democracy and centralism is essentially interconnected, unified, and inseparable. Democracy is the foundation of centralism; only with a full democratic life can a high degree of centralism be established; only with correct centralism can a genuine spirit of democracy be promoted. He pointed out that democratic centralism conforms to the truth of the greatest benefit for the greatest number of people. Only the Communist Party, which represents the greatest benefit for the greatest number of people, and the Youth League or other revolutionary organizations led by the Communist Party can truly apply democratic centralism. The fourth part explained the specific content of the organizational independence of the Youth League. It provided explanations on the three aspects of the Youth League's work, cadres, and budget. It pointed out that under the Party's general tasks and guidelines, the Youth League should have its independent work and activities. In the afternoon, the representatives were divided into groups to discuss the four documents: Comrade Ren Bishi's political report, Comrade Feng Wenbin's work report and work program, and the draft constitution of the League.

    Yesterday, the congress received a total of four congratulatory telegrams, from the Central Committee of the All-Union Leninist Communist Youth League, the Jin-Sui Democratic Youth Federation and the Youth League Preparatory Committee, the First Congress of the Harbin Municipal Youth League, and all railway League members in Shijiazhuang. When the chairman read out the congratulatory telegram from the Central Committee of the All-Union Leninist Communist Youth League, it repeatedly evoked enthusiastic applause from the audience.
