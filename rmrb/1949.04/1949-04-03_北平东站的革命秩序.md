　　Revolutionary Order at Beiping East Station
    Chen Ji
    The order at Beiping East Station is much better now than before. People entering the station form a long line, one after another, without any noise or yelling. When the marshals check the disembarking passengers, they always explain in a friendly manner: "This is different from the inspections by the Kuomintang reactionaries. Please don't be afraid. Our inspections are for the safety of all the people."
    Workers and staff at the East Station told reporters that maintaining order was impossible when the Kuomintang reactionaries were here. The Railway Bureau stipulated that everyone, regardless of rank, had to buy tickets for first-class reserved seats, but this simply wouldn't work when it came to the Kuomintang army. Anyone who asked them for a ticket would be beaten severely. Last July, stationmaster Liu Rulin was injured by more than twenty "honorary soldiers" from the Kuomintang 208th Division for asking for tickets, and he was hospitalized for more than a month before he recovered. Last October, a Judge Lin from the court was seeing his girlfriend off on the train. He argued with Stationmaster Li because he didn't have a ticket. Later, he called more than twenty bailiffs to the station to arrest people, and the court's prosecutor even wanted to open a temporary court in the station to interrogate Stationmaster Li. The order of buying tickets, queuing, boarding, and disembarking had nothing to do with these privileged people. The staff had to deal with these bastards all day long, constantly worried about things going wrong. They would say "Amitabha" if they weren't beaten or cursed for a day. There was no way they were in the mood to improve their work! They turned a blind eye to it all.
    In the past, they turned a blind eye to things; now they inspect and improve their work every day.
    Since the People's Liberation Army arrived in Beiping, the staff have no more worries or fears. The People's Liberation Army has set a model in observing station order, and passengers no longer need to be managed. The arrogant special agents and officials of the past are now also respectful. Although there were some scattered soldiers rushing around in the past few days, things have been much better recently after the marshals strengthened their control.
    The staff said: "Today we are serving the people, and our goal is to establish a new people's station. Our work is never sloppy. We have review meetings every day to inspect our work."
    During the period of military control, before revolutionary order was fully established, the Pingjin Garrison Command's marshal team, which is responsible for inspecting passengers coming to and from the East Station, is now strengthening its work. In the past few days, the highest number of scattered soldiers and vagrants captured in a single day reached more than seventy, and even now, ten to twenty are still being discovered every day. In order to stabilize finance and protect people's lives, the government prohibits the circulation of silver dollars; however, there are still daily reports of unscrupulous merchants secretly taking silver dollars out of the country. The highest amount of silver dollars seized from unscrupulous merchants in a single day reached three hundred yuan. Recently, the number of passengers has increased daily, and the East Station now has as many as 14,000 passengers every day. Although the number of trains has increased to forty round trips, there are still more people than trains, so scalpers are taking the opportunity to cause trouble, which also hinders station order. The marshal team is also cracking down on this. In order to further establish the order of the people's station, the team believes that revolutionary cadres must first consciously abide by it. Recently, it was discovered that individual working cadres could not observe station order, arbitrarily cutting into passenger lines, or boarding the train without going through the formalities of buying tickets. After being criticized by the marshal team, they admitted their mistakes; however, this kind of bad phenomenon must be completely eliminated.

　　北平东站的革命秩序
    陈迹
    北平东站的秩序，现在是比从前好多了。进站的人们，一个跟着一个，自然形成长蛇阵，没有乱吵乱骂的声音。纠察员检查下车的旅客时，总是和和气气解释着：“这和国民党反动派检查不同，请大家不要害怕，咱们检查，是为了人民大伙儿安全。”
    东车站的工人和职员向记者说，国民党反动派在这儿的时候，要想维持秩序是做不到的。铁路局规定，头等对号车任何人都要买票，但一碰到国民党的军队，就硬是行不通。谁要向他们要票，就要被臭打一顿。去年七月，站长刘汝霖曾因要票被国民党二○八师二十多个“荣誉军人”打伤，在医院住了一个多月才痊愈。去年十月底，有个法院的林推事送他的女朋友上车，因无票和李站长闹了起来，后来他叫了二十多个法警来站捕人，法院的检察官还要在车站开临时审判厅审问李站长。卖票、排队、上车、下车的秩序，和这些特权者毫没关系。职工们一天到晚应付这批混蛋，提心吊胆，生怕出乱子；只要一天没挨打骂，真是阿弥陀佛了，那里有心情改进工作！睁一眼闭一眼算了。
    从前做事是睁一眼闭一眼；现在天天检查改进工作。
    自从解放军到了北平城，职工们没有了顾虑和畏惧。人民解放军在遵守车站秩序上起了模范作用，乘车的客人也不用人管了。过去盛气凌人的特务官吏也恭顺了。前些日子虽也有一些散兵东闯西撞，但经纠察员严加管制之后，最近也好多了。
    职工们说：“咱们今天是为人民服务，目的是建立新的人民车站。我们的工作决不马虎，每天我们有检讨会，检查我们的工作。”
    在军管时期，革命秩序没有完全建立之前，负责检查东车站来往客人的平津卫戍司令部纠察队，现正加强其工作。在前些日子里，一天查获的散兵游勇最高曾达七十余人，直到现在，每天尚要发现一二十个。政府为了稳定金融，保护人民生活，禁止银元流通；但私带银元出境的奸商，还是日有所闻。查获奸商的银元最高日达三百元。最近乘客日增，每天东站乘客已达一万四千人。虽车次已增至四十往复，但仍是人多车少，卖黑票的遂乘机作怪，对于车站秩序亦有所妨碍，纠察队亦在取缔中。该队为了进一步建立人民车站的秩序，认为革命干部必须首先自觉遵守。最近曾发现个别的工作干部不能遵守车站秩序，随便穿插客人的行列；或不按照手续买票上车，经纠察队批评后，他们虽已承认错误；但这种恶劣现象，必须完全消灭。
