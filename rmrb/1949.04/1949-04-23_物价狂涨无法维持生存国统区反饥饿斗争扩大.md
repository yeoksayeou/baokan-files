　　Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, April 21st: The anti-hunger struggle of teachers and staff in various Kuomintang-controlled areas continues to expand. The Shanghai Secondary and Higher Education Staff Association, in order to oppose meager treatment, sent five representatives to Nanking on the 19th to petition the puppet Presidential Office, the Executive Yuan, and the Legislative Yuan, but the petitions yielded no results. The representatives returned to Shanghai on the 20th. More than 1,000 teachers from municipal primary and secondary schools in Guangzhou began a strike on the 19th due to delayed salary payments and constantly rising prices, making it impossible for them to maintain their livelihoods. Two hundred and fifty professors at Sun Yat-sen University, after persisting in a strike for three weeks, decided to temporarily resume classes on the 19th in order to take into consideration the students' studies, but they still insisted on striving to improve their treatment. The professors of the school condemned the puppet Ministry of Education for failing to remit funds on time and for issuing salaries in installments and in small amounts, making it impossible for them to maintain their livelihoods amidst skyrocketing prices.

　　The anti-hunger strike of eighteen provincial colleges in Chengdu has persisted for more than three weeks, and the strike of professors and teaching assistants at Sichuan University has persisted for more than a month, but the reactionary Kuomintang government still refuses to make a reasonable settlement. The teachers of the provincial colleges initially only demanded that salaries be issued at 1,000 times the cost of living index, but the reactionary education authorities did not agree. Prices have continued to soar in the past three weeks, and the Sichuan puppet provincial government has now been forced to agree to issue salaries at 3,000 times the cost of living index, but because this is far removed from the actual cost of living index, the teachers still have no intention of resuming classes.

　　物价狂涨无法维持生存国统区反饥饿斗争扩大
    【新华社北平二十一日电】国民党统治区各地教职员的反饥饿斗争继续扩大。上海市中等以上学校的教职员联谊会为反对菲薄的待遇，推派代表五人于十九日到达南京向伪总统府、行政院、立法院请愿，请愿没有任何结果。代表们已于二十日返回上海。广州市立中小学教师一千多人，因为薪水迟迟不发。而物价又节节上涨，已于十九日起开始罢教。中山大学的二百五十位教授，在坚持罢教三星期后，为了顾全学生的学业，决定于十九日暂时复课，但仍坚持争取改善待遇。该校教授谴责伪教育部不按时汇款，和分期零星发薪，使他们在物价狂涨中无法维持生存。
    成都十八个省立院校的反饥饿罢教已坚持三个星期以上，四川大学教授助教的罢教已坚持一个月以上，国民党反动政府仍然拒作合理解决。省立院校教师们最初只要求薪津按生活指数一千倍发给，反动教育当局不答应。三星期来物价不断猛涨，四川伪省府现已被迫答应照三千倍发给，但因为已离开实际生活指数很远，教师们仍无意复教。
