Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 10th: Moscow dispatch: One of the secretaries of the Central Committee of the All-Union Leninist Young Communist League of the Soviet Union, Ivanov, delivered a report on the revision of the League's constitution at the League's 11th Representative Congress on the 5th. Ivanov pointed out that the original constitution was in line with the League's various tasks and was suitable for the times. However, now, the League's organizations face new and significant tasks of communist education for young people. The role of the Youth League as the Party's assistant in national economic and cultural construction has been enhanced. Therefore, according to the changed situation, it is necessary to make certain revisions and supplements to the League's constitution.

Ivanov declared that all revisions to the Constitution of the All-Union Leninist Young Communist League of the Soviet Union stipulate the resolute further expansion of democracy within the League, the expansion of the rights and activities of League members, stipulate the responsibilities of League organizations to League members, and enhance the role of the League's grassroots organizations. All of this once again emphasizes the role of the League as a reserve force of the Bolshevik Party, as an assistant to the Communist Party in the struggle to build communism, and in the communist education of young people. Ivanov said that the constitution must also stipulate that the League must carry out Marxist-Leninist ideological propaganda, resolutely and tirelessly struggle to implement the resolutions of the All-Union Communist Party and the Soviet government. Every League member must be a model of compliance with the Soviet Constitution. Ivanov proposed that the constitution include the provision that all League members must make every effort to develop Soviet culture and strengthen the friendship and fraternal cooperation between all nationalities of the Soviet Union. Defending the motherland is the sacred duty of every League member. The All-Union Leninist Young Communist League of the Soviet Union must contribute to the cause of consolidating the anti-imperialist democratic camp and must be faithful to the principles of proletarian internationalism. Ivanov also stated that the constitution must also stipulate measures to further improve the League's leadership of the Young Pioneers and stipulate the basic tasks of the Young Pioneers.

The congress conducted extensive discussions on Ivanov's report. The committee elected by the congress, based on the majority of the representatives' suggestions, put forward a proposal on the revision of the League's constitution. The congress unanimously approved this proposal and the League's constitution. The representatives pointed out that the revised constitution will further consolidate and expand the ranks of the League and strengthen the activities of League members.

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 10th: Moscow dispatch: The 11th Representative Congress of the All-Union Leninist Young Communist League of the Soviet Union closed on the 8th after electing new leading bodies. The congress on the 7th conducted candidate nominations, discussions, and secret ballots. The election results were announced on the 8th, with a total of 103 members elected to the Central Committee, 47 alternate members of the Central Committee, and 31 members of the Central Auditing Commission. After the election, the congress, which lasted for eleven days, closed.

　　进一步巩固和扩大团的队伍
  　苏联青年团修改团章
    选出团中央后代表大会闭幕
    【新华社北平十日电】莫斯科讯：苏联共产主义青年团中央委员会书记之一伊凡诺夫五日在该团第十一届代表大会上作了关于修改团章的报告。伊氏指出：原来的团章是符合团的各项任务和适合时宜的。然而，现在在团的组织面前，有着以共产主义教育青年的新的重大的任务。青年团作为党在国家经济文化建设方面的助手的作用，已经提高了。因此，按照改变了的情况，团章有作某些修改和补充的必要。
    伊氏宣称：苏联共产主义青年团团章的一切修改，规定了坚决地进一步扩大团内民主，扩大团员的权利及其活动，规定团的各个组织对团员的责任，提高团基层组织的作用。所有这一切，都是再度强调团作为布尔什维克党的后备军的作用，作为共产党在建设共产主义的斗争中，以共产主义教育青年的助手的作用。伊氏称：团章中也必需规定。团必须进行马列主义的思想宣传，坚决不倦地为实现联共党与苏维埃政府的决议而斗争。每一个团员必须是遵守苏联宪法的模范。伊氏提议团章中列入这一条，即凡团员必须尽一切努力，发展苏维埃文化，加强苏联各民族间的友谊与兄弟般的合作。保卫祖国是每一个团员神圣的职责。苏联共产主义青年团必须对巩固反帝国主义民主阵营的事业有所贡献，必须忠实于无产阶级国际主义的原则。伊氏并称：团章也必须规定采取措施，进一步改进团对少年先锋队的领导工作，并规定少先队的基本任务。
    大会对伊凡诺夫的报告作了广泛的讨论。大会选出的委员会，根据代表们的大部建议提出关于修改团章的议案。大会一致通过了这个议案和团章。代表们指出：修改后的团章，将进一步巩固和扩大团的队伍，并加强团员的活动。
    【新华社北平十日电】莫斯科讯：苏联共产主义青年团第十一届代表大会在选出新的领导机构后，已于八日闭幕。七日的大会进行了候选人提名，讨论及秘密投票。八日公布选举结果，共选出中央委员会委员一百零三名，候补中央委员四十七名，中央监察委员会委员三十一名。选举结束后，一共开了十一天的大会即行闭幕。
