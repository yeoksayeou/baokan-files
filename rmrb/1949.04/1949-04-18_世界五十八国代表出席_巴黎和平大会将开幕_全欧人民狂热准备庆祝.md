Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 16th: The Polish Press Agency reports from Paris: The preparatory committee for the World Congress of Supporters of Peace is preparing to receive approximately two thousand representatives from fifty-eight countries attending the congress. Eighty hotels and a corresponding number of restaurants have been reserved for the representatives. Thirty translators will simultaneously translate speeches for the representatives in French, English, Russian, Spanish, and other languages. The congress will be held in the Pleyel Hall. The second floor of the hall will serve as a press box.

All of Europe is celebrating the World Congress of Supporters of Peace, which is to open in Paris in three days. Various posters with the congress logo have been posted on the streets of Paris. The preparatory committee has received tens of thousands of letters and telegrams from French groups and individuals expressing their willingness to help the preparatory committee organize the preparations for the congress. The Amsterdam Daily in the Netherlands publishes special issues every day to report on the progress of the peace movement. A meeting of democratic groups and workers was held in Helsinki, Finland, where representatives preparing to attend the Paris Peace Congress spoke, emphasizing Finland's demand for peace.

The preparatory committee continues to receive more and more declarations and letters in support of the Peace Congress, including those from the Israeli United Workers' Party, the Spanish Communist Party, one million residents of Prague, the Indonesian Youth League with 2.5 million members, the All-India Trade Union Congress with 800 trade unions, the Indian Peasants' Union with one million members, the Ecuadorian Women's League, the Finnish Youth League, the African Youth Workers' League, the Spanish Anti-Franco Alliance in Havana with 8,000 members, and prominent figures such as Wallace from the United States, Britain, Argentina, Venezuela, Chile, and Sweden. The twenty-seven-member delegation from the United States includes Black professor Du Bois, novelist Fast, artist Kent, Black singer Robeson, Leather Workers Union Secretary Lucy, and former Assistant Attorney General Rogge.

The French government continues to restrict and obstruct representatives from attending the Peace Congress. Of the twenty-two-member German delegation, France has refused to grant passports to fifteen people. The French government also refused to issue a passport to Indonesian representative Rukioeno. This action by the French government continues to draw strong criticism from the International Association of Journalists and Polish newspapers. The Central Bureau of the French General Confederation of Labor issued a communiqué protesting the government's reactionary measures restricting representatives from attending the Peace Congress and expressing the solidarity of the French working class with the representatives of various countries who were unable to attend the Peace Congress as a result. The French Communist newspaper L'Humanité said that no matter what the decision of this representative may cause, the French people will warmly welcome the delegations from various countries.

　　世界五十八国代表出席
  　巴黎和平大会将开幕
    全欧人民狂热准备庆祝
    【新华社北平十六日电】波兰通讯社自巴黎报道：世界拥护和平大会筹委会正在准备接待来自五十八个国家的约二千名出席大会的代表，给代表们定了八十所旅馆和相应数量的饭店。三十位译员将同时以法、英、俄、西班牙等语言翻译供代表们的讲演。大会将在布电耶大厅召开。大厅的二层楼将作为记者席。
    全欧都在庆祝三天后就要在巴黎开幕的世界拥护和平大会。巴黎街上已张贴各种有和平大会会章的宣传画。筹委会已接获法国数以万计的团体与个人的函电，表示愿意帮助筹委会组织大会的筹备工作。荷兰阿姆斯特丹每日出版专刊，报道和平运动的进展。芬京赫尔辛基举行了民主团体与工人的集会，准备出席巴黎和平大会代表在会上演说，强调芬兰要求和平。
    筹委会陆续收到愈来愈多的拥护和平大会的宣言与函电，其中有以色列统一工人党、西班牙共产党、布拉格一百万居民、拥有二百五十万会员的印尼青年联盟、包括八百个职工会的全印职工大会、拥有一百万会员的印度农民联盟、厄瓜多尔妇女联盟、芬兰青年联盟、非洲青年工人联盟、在哈瓦那的拥有八千会员的西班牙反佛朗哥联盟及美、英、阿根廷、委内瑞拉、智利、瑞典等国的著名人物华莱士等。美国出席大会的二十七人代表团中有黑人教授杜波伊斯、小说家法斯特、艺术家肯特、黑人歌王罗伯逊、鞣皮工人工会书记芦基、前司法部助理部长罗治。
    法国政府继续限制与阻挠和平大会的代表赴会。在由二十二人组成的德国代表团中，法国已拒绝给予十五人的护照。法政府同时拒发护照给印尼代表芦基奥诺。法政府这种行动，继续引起国际新闻记者协会和波兰报纸的严厉抨击。法国总工会中央局所发表公报，抗议政府限制出席和平大会代表的反动措施，并对因此不能出席和平大会的各国代表，表示法国劳动阶级的声援。法共人道报说，不论这一代表的决定会造成怎样的结果，法国人民将热烈欢迎各国的代表团。
