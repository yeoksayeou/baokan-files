[Jizhong News] In order to realize the democratization of factory management, the state-owned Lihua Flour Mill in Jizhong mobilized all employees to inspect past management methods and factory leadership. After the trade union carried out class education and established the concept of workers as masters of the factory, the workers in the flour group proposed: the factory lacks systems and discipline; there is no record of how much flour and bran are produced, how much coal is burned, and how much machine oil is used each day. As a result, it is unclear who is saving and who is wasting, or whether the factory is making or losing money. The workers in the boiler group proposed: employees do not know who to ask for leave when going home, and some people go home casually without administrative knowledge; there is no system for recording work and attendance. No one is specifically responsible for receiving or adding equipment and materials, and no one is specifically in charge of production, resulting in inappropriate labor allocation. When machines break down, the leadership does not organize technicians to study and improve them, which seriously affects production. In terms of administrative management and business operations, there is also extreme disorder due to the lack of dedicated personnel and unclear division of labor. The employees also believe that past factory management did not follow the mass line and lacked management methods of division of labor and responsibility at each level. Therefore, there is a great waste of machinery, raw materials, and tools. For example, in terms of coal burning, sometimes 320 jin are burned per hour, and sometimes as much as 450 jin; in terms of machine oil, sometimes 18 jin are used per day, but sometimes 56 jin are used; there is also no standard for flour extraction from wheat, sometimes 71 jin are extracted from every 100 jin of wheat, and sometimes 80 jin; some bran is not ground cleanly, and 100 jin of bran contains 11 to 20 jin of white flour. The workers also researched and found that the reason for the above situation is that the factory leaders - the factory director and deputy director - are not united, push work to each other, and are not responsible, thus often abandoning leadership of the factory, causing great damage to the work. Based on the workers' opinions, the factory leadership first conducted strict self-criticism in each department, and mutually launched criticism and self-criticism. On this basis, the factory and the trade union put forward methods for improving the factory, first calling on employees to return to their posts ideologically, establishing the idea of relying on workers to build the factory, continuing to improve the class consciousness of the workers, absorbing workers to participate in factory management, establishing various systems and disciplines, and making factory management democratic and enterprise-oriented.

　　冀中国营利华面粉厂
    发动职工检查工作
  　工人要求确立登记考勤等制度
    【冀中讯】国营利华面粉厂为实现工厂管理民主化，发动全厂职工对过去的管理方法，及工厂领导，进行检查。在职工会进行了阶级教育，树立工人主人翁思想之后，面粉组的工人提出：工厂没有制度和纪律，每天出多少面和麸子，烧多少煤，用多少机油，没有登记。结果谁节省谁浪费，赚钱或赔钱，都弄不清。锅炉组的工人提出：职工人员回家，不知道向谁请假，有的人随便回家行政上也不知道，没有记工考勤制度。领取或添购器材无专人负责，生产上亦没有专人指挥，劳力配备上不适当。机器发生障碍时，领导上也不组织技师研究改进，严重影响生产。在事务管理及业务经营上，也因无专人负责及分工不明确，极为紊乱。职工们并认为过去工厂管理没有走群众路线，缺乏分工负责和逐级负责制的管理方法。因此，在机器、原料、工具各方面的浪费很大。如烧煤，一个钟头有烧三百二十斤的，有时竟烧到四百五十斤；用机器油，有时每天用十八斤，有时却用到五十六斤；麦子出面也没有标准，有时每百斤麦子出七十一斤，有时则出八十斤；有的麸子磨不净，一百斤麸子中还有十一斤到二十斤白面。工人们并研究出造成以上情形的原因是工厂领导上——正副厂长闹不团结，工作互相推靠，互不负责，因此常常放弃对工厂的领导，使工作遭受到极大损夫。工厂领导上根据工人意见，首先在各科作了严格的检讨，相互展开了批评与自我批评。并在这个基础上由工厂和职工会提出改进工厂办法，首先号召职员思想归队，树立依靠工人建厂的思想，继续提高工人阶级觉悟，吸收工人参加工厂管理，树立各种制度、纪律，使工厂管理走向民主化、企业化。
