　　North China Women's Congress Opens in Beiping

　　Comrade Bo Yibo Attends and Reports

　　Emphasizing that the current task of women's work is to unite urban and rural women and participate in production and construction in all aspects.

　　[Our Newspaper] Following the First National Women's Congress, the North China Women's Representative Conference opened at 9:00 AM yesterday (the 15th) at Huairentang. Comrade Song Ting from the former Jin-Cha-Ji and Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Women's Federation first announced the opening of the conference and explained the tasks of this meeting. Two hundred and ninety-six representatives attended, and a presidium consisting of twenty-one members including Zhang Ruihua, Yang Yunyu, Zhao Jinzi, Li Xiuzhen, Han Qimin, and Ji Yun was formed. They listened attentively to Comrade Bo Yibo's report. The atmosphere was intense and solemn.

　　Comrade Yibo first expressed his earnest hopes for this meeting, pointing out that this conference is not to re-examine principles and directions, but to solve specific problems in women's work based on the principles and directions decided by the National Women's Congress. During the Anti-Japanese War, in the land reform, and in the work of production and supporting the front lines, the women of North China have done their best and made great achievements. Now that North China has entered a new period of construction, women's work should study how to participate in production and construction in all aspects. There are three tasks that women should be called upon to participate in: (1) call on women to participate in childcare and hygiene work; (2) call on women to become primary school teachers; (3) participate in various lighter production undertakings, such as accounting, warehousing, and cooperative management. Other issues, such as freedom of marriage and whether women should bring a share of land when they marry, should also be specifically resolved so that future women's work in North China can be aligned with the spirit of the National Women's Congress. Afterwards, Comrade Yibo gave a detailed analysis and study of the current situation and the structure of the Chinese economy, and, according to Chairman Mao's instructions, gave a good explanation of the New Democratic economic policy, pointing out that the current task of women's work is to unite urban and rural women and the broad masses of women to participate in production and take part in various work posts, and to strive for production and construction. Only by achieving economic emancipation in production can political emancipation be thoroughly achieved. Comrade Yibo finally proposed to carry out an enlightenment movement among the working women masses to awaken their class consciousness. The main content of the education is "labor creates everything," and the working women should be educated with the viewpoint of class struggle and the materialist conception of history, so that they can more actively participate in production.

　　After Comrade Yibo's report, the conference adjourned. Group discussions were held in the evening.

　　华北妇代大会在平揭幕
  　薄一波同志出席报告
    指出目前妇女工作的任务，是团结城乡妇女，  从各方面参加生产建设。
    【本报讯】继全国妇女第一次代表大会之后，华北妇女代表会议，昨（十五）日上午九时，在怀仁堂揭幕。首先由原晋察冀、晋冀鲁豫妇联宋汀同志宣布开会，并说明这次会议的任务。出席代表二百九十六名，由张瑞华、杨蕴玉、赵金子、李秀镇、韩启民、纪云等二十一位组成主席团，静听薄一波同志的报告，会场情况紧张而静肃。
    一波同志首先对这次会议寄予殷切希望，指出这次大会不是再研究方针方向等问题，而是根据全国妇女代表大会所决定的方针方向，解决妇女工作中的具体问题。华北妇女在抗日时期对敌斗争中，在土地改革中，在生产和支援前线的工作中，都尽了自己的力量，做出很好的成绩。今后华北已经进入新的建设时期，妇女工作应该研究从各方面参加生产建设工作。有三件工作应号召妇女参加进去：（一）号召妇女们参加保育卫生工作；（二）号召妇女做小学教员；（三）参加各种比较轻的生产事业，如会计、保管、合作社主任等。其他如婚姻自由问题、妇女出嫁是否带一份土地问题等，亦应具体解决，使今后华北妇女工作与这次全国妇代大会的决议精神衔接起来。之后，一波同志就目前情况及中国经济的构成，加以详细分析研究，根据毛主席的指示，对新民主主义的经济政策作了很好的解释，指出目前妇女工作的任务是团结城乡妇女及广大妇女群众，参加生产，参加到各种工作岗位上去，为生产建设而努力。只有在生产上翻身了，政治上才能澈底翻身。一波同志最后提议在劳动妇女群众中，进行一个启蒙运动，启发劳动妇女的阶级觉悟。主要教育内容是“劳动创造一切”，用阶级斗争的观点，唯物史观的观点教育劳动的妇女，以使能更积极的参加生产。
    一波同志报告后，大会休会，晚间小组讨论。
