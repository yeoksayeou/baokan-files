    Protest Against the Atrocities of British Warships (II)

    As the angry tide of the Chinese People's Democratic Revolution has swept across the Yangtze River to the south, the attitude of the imperialist aggressors is noteworthy. Just as the Nanjing Kuomintang government announced its rejection of the peace agreement, four British warships intruded into the Yangtze River defense line of the People's Liberation Army on April 20th and 21st, and jointly shelled the People's Liberation Army with Kuomintang warships, causing 252 casualties among our loyal and patriotic soldiers. This incident has now shocked China and foreign countries, arousing not only the anger of the Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army, but also the protests of most British people except for a very small number of die-hard imperialist elements. The British people do not understand why, in the critical period of China's civil war, the British government suddenly ordered its warships to intrude into China's inland river and into the water defense line of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. The British people have raised a legitimate demand: immediately withdraw all British armed forces from China. We believe that the British government must implement compensation, punishment of the murderers, and apology to the Chinese People's Liberation Army. The British Foreign Office spokesman arrogantly declared that the Chinese People's Liberation Army's resistance to the British warships' aggression was an "aggression" against Britain. But British imperialists must understand that China is no longer the time of the British warships bombing Wanxian in 1926, nor the time of the joint bombing of Nanjing by Britain, the United States and other countries in 1927. The Yangtze River already belongs to the Chinese people and their People's Liberation Army, and no longer belongs to the traitorous compradors. The British Conservative Party members are right, this was indeed "unimaginable" a few years ago. The military forces of British aggressors must withdraw from China. The American aggressive forces, which usually stood in front of Britain to invade China and interfere in China's civil war, but this time let Britain stand in front, first of all its naval, land and air forces stationed on China's territorial waters and territories, must withdraw from China. In short, the aggressive forces of any imperialist country, first of all their naval, land and air forces stationed on China's territorial waters and territories, must withdraw from China; only in this way can they have the possibility of establishing commercial and diplomatic relations with China on an equal footing. Foreigners can engage in various benevolent businesses in China on an equal footing with the Chinese people, provided they obtain the permission of the Chinese People's Government and abide by the laws of the People's Government, but they are not allowed to continue to maintain imperialist privileges.

    抗议英舰暴行（二）
    当中国人民民主革命的怒潮已经席卷长江以南的时候，值得注意的是帝国主义侵略分子的态度。恰当前南京国民党政府宣布拒绝和平协定的时候，英国军舰四艘在四月二十日和二十一日竟侵入长江人民解放军防线，与国民党军舰共同炮击人民解放军，致我忠勇为国健儿伤亡二百五十二人之众。这件事现已震动中外，不但引起了中国人民和中国人民解放军的愤怒，而且引起了除极少数帝国主义死硬派分子以外大多数英国人民的抗议。英国人民不懂得，何以在中国国内战争的紧急时期，英国政府突然命令它的军舰侵入中国内河，而且侵入中国人民解放军的水上防线。英国人民提出了正议的要求：立即将英国武装力量全部撤出中国。我们认为英国政府必须向中国人民解放军实行赔偿、惩凶和道歉。英国外交部发言人狂妄地宣称：中国人民解放军抵抗英国军舰的侵略是对于英国的“侵略”。但是英国帝国主义者们必须懂得：中国现在不是一九二六年英舰炮轰万县的时候了，不是一九二七年英美等国联合炮轰南京的时候了，长江已经属于中国人民及其人民解放军，而不再属于奴颜婢膝者的卖国者了。英国保守党分子说得对，这在几年前确是“不能想像”的事。英国的侵略者的军事力量必须退出中国。平时站在英国前面侵略中国并干涉中国内战，而在这次却让英国站在前面的美国侵略势力，首先是它驻在中国领水领土上的海陆空军，必须退出中国。总之，任何帝国主义国家的侵略势力，首先是它们驻在中国领水领土上的海陆空军，都必须退出中国；只有这样，它们才有以平等地位与中国建立通商和外交关系的可能。外国人可以在获得中国人民政府允许和服从人民政府法令的条件下，以和中国人民平等的地位，在中国从事各种善良的业务，却不允许继续保持帝国主义的特权。
