The Enterprise Department of the North China People's Government and the Enterprise Department of the Beiping Military Control Commission jointly presented a banner to all the employees of the Shijingshan Power Plant, rewarding them for their achievement of keeping Beiping powered without interruption for nearly two months. The banner read, "Vanguard of Increased Production." "Two Months of Continuous Brightness" - those who have lived in Beiping for a long time know its value. During the rule of the Japanese invaders and Chiang Kai-shek's bandits, there were either power outages by district or scheduled power outages. It is the first time in ten years that we have enjoyed two months of continuous light. Here are two small incidents: First, before liberation, the boiler always developed "growths" (impurities). The "growths" would require the furnace to be shut down, and the power to be cut off. Now, surprisingly, there have been no major "growths" for more than three months. It's not surprising: "It's our own machine; would we let it get sick?" Second, not long ago, a dry gas pipe inside a furnace burst. In the past, the furnace would have been shut down for repairs. Now, the workers said, "We can't cut off the power!" After research, they said, "Repair it without shutting down the furnace." In the latter half of the night, when electricity demand was low, they cooled and dried it simultaneously. When the furnace still had a scorching high temperature of over 50 degrees, workers Cui Fugui and several others crawled inside. As a result, it was repaired without cutting off the power. Currently, a production competition is underway at the plant in April, and everywhere there are cries of "No one will fall behind!" The No. 3 machine disassembly and repair team voluntarily adds two hours of work every morning and noon, without pay. The No. 3 machine disassembly and repair was scheduled to be completed in two months. After disassembly, more places needing repair were discovered. Some said, "It won't be repaired in two months, right?" But with the current work enthusiasm, it can be done in a month and a half. They are closely united and use criticism to consolidate unity. Striving for speed, they have not forgotten the thoroughness of the work. Cui Denglun did not apply lead powder when tightening a screw. He said several times: "The work was a little sloppy!" Regarding saving, they put forward the slogan of not wasting a single drop of oil. Their efforts have motivated several nearby work teams.

### 北平两月没停电原因是什么？

　　北平两月没停电
    原因是什么？
    华北人民政府企业部和北平军管会企业处合送了一面锦旗给石景山发电厂的全体职工，奖励职工们对北平近两月前夜不停电的成绩。旗上写的是“增产前锋”四个大字。“光明连两月”，久住北平的人才知道它的价值。在日寇和蒋匪统治时期，要不是分区停电，就是定时停电，连续享受两月光明，这是十年来第一次。这里有两件小事：一、解放前锅炉内老是生“瘤”（杂质），生“瘤”就要停炉停电；现在奇怪：三个多月就没有生大“瘤”。也不奇怪：“自己的机器，还让它生病么？”二、不久前有一个炉内干气管爆了，照以前是停炉修理。现在职工们说：“不能停电！”研究的结果，说“不停炉修理”。在后半夜用电少时，一面冷却一面干。当炉内还有五十多度炙人的高温时，工人崔富贵等几个就钻进去了，结果不停电就修好了。　，现在四月生产竞赛正在该厂展开，到处是一片“谁也不落后呀”的呼喊。三号机拆修班自动每日早上、中午增加两个钟头的工，不要薪。三号机拆修，在计划中规定两个月完成，拆开后发现更多需要修的地方。有人说：“两个月修不好吧？”但照现在的工作热情，一个半月就能弄好。他们紧密团结，并用批评来巩固团结。争取速度，没有忘记工作的确实。崔登仑在上一颗螺丝钉的时候没有上铅粉，他几次说：“工作马虎了一点！”对于节省，他们提出不浪费一滴油的口号。他们的努力，已带动了临近的几个工作班。
