　　Ping City Trade Company Inspects Grain Retail Stores to Ensure People's Food Supply

　　[Our Newspaper] To ensure the quality of food for the citizens, the Grain Branch of the Ping City Trade Company has recently conducted investigations into the work of the 477 established processing and retail stores, and has listened to feedback from factories, organizations, schools, cooperatives, and citizens. It was discovered that some individual retail stores were engaging in dishonest practices. These retail stores, in order to save electricity and labor, produced coarse flour; or they substituted inferior goods for the corn and wheat entrusted by the company, processing and selling them afterwards. After investigation, those who admitted their mistakes (such as Yongda Flour Mill at 7 Baozi Street, Inner Second District), guaranteed finer processing in the future, and attached a letter of repentance, were still allowed to retail. Another example is Jinshengyuan Store on Dongdan Rice Market Street, which not only did not admit its mistake, but also argued that "the workers took the wrong flour sample, and the bad flour was old flour from sweeping the bottom of the pile." The company immediately issued a warning and suspended processing. Many honest merchants among the retail stores processed and milled according to the company's standards and were praised by the citizens. For example, Yuanchangyong at 120 Qianwai Street and Yongshengxiang Retail Store at 7 Anyuan Hutong, Inner Second District, first dried the grain they received, and the milling method was also more refined, removing the bran more thoroughly, thus improving the quality. There were many buyers, and they could sell 1,000 to 1,500 catties of corn flour, 1,500 to 2,000 catties of millet flour, and 400 to 500 catties of sorghum per day.

　　平市贸易公司为保证民食
  　检查粮食代销店工作
    【本报讯】平市贸易公司粮食分公司为保证市民食粮质量，近特对所建立之四七七家加工代销店的工作进行各方面的调查，并向各工厂机关学校合作社市民听取反映，发现了个别的代销店有捣鬼现象。这种代销店为了省电省工，使所磨出的面粉粗糙；或以劣货顶替公司委托的玉米小麦，加工后出售。调查后，对于承认错误的（如内二区报子街七号永大制粉厂），保证以后加工细制，且附有悔过书者，仍允许代销。另如东单米市大街的晋生源号，不仅不承认错误，且巧辩说系“工人把面样拿错了，坏的面粉是打扫底子的陈面”。公司方面即予当面警告，暂停加工。代销店中有不少正当商人，按着公司的标准加工磨制，得到市民赞许者，如前外大街一二○号源昌永，内二区按院胡同七号永盛祥代销店，将领取的粮食先行晒干，磨法也比较精细，提净皮壳，品质因之提高，购买户很多，每天玉米面可售一千斤至一千五百斤，小米面一千五百斤至二千斤，高粮四百斤至五百斤。
