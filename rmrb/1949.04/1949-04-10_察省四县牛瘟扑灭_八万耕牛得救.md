　　Cattle Plague Eradicated in Four Counties of Chahar Province, Saving 80,000 Head of Cattle
  　[Chahar News] The cattle plague in Kangbao, Baoyuan, Duolun, and Chongli counties in northern Chahar Province has been eradicated. The epidemic prevention team is now transferring to work in northern Yanbei. During this period, the epidemic prevention teams in northern Chahar treated a total of 776 sick cattle and performed immune injections on 74,219 cattle. In Chicheng, Sihai, and four other counties in Hebei-Chahar, they treated 110 sick cattle and performed immune injections on 12,593 cattle. In both areas, a total of 886 sick cattle were treated, and 86,812 immune injections were performed. In the epidemic prevention work, the technical personnel of each team and cadres at all levels engaged in epidemic prevention work were mostly hardworking, enduring, and actively responsible. For example, Doctor Su Lin stayed up several nights to rush-produce rabbit-adapted vaccine, and still insisted on working during the day. Jing, the director of the Zhangjiakou Animal Husbandry Farm, and Doctor Tang Chunyuan's group, etc., injected vaccines under the light of lamps all night and created many new methods: they overcame the difficulties of the lack of distilled water and physiological saline, and also made their own refrigerators, which extended the validity period of the vaccine. Local cadres also played a significant role in the coordination work. The main responsible cadres in the counties and districts of northern Chahar were able to go deep into the masses to carry out propaganda and conscientiously organize the work of blockade, isolation, and concentration of cattle herds. Due to the efforts of all personnel, including doctors and cadres, the medical speed was increased from about 100 injections per day to a shocking work efficiency of more than 3,000 injections. At the same time, due to the detailed publicity to farmers and the impact of practical work achievements, superstition was broken, science was believed, and the concern of the Party and the People's Government for them was recognized. Therefore, they rushed from dozens of miles away to request injections, which also laid a good foundation for long-term epidemic prevention work. (Sun Jiyu)

　　察省四县牛瘟扑灭
  　八万耕牛得救
    【察哈尔讯】察北康保、宝源、多伦、崇礼等四县牛瘟已告扑灭。现防疫队转雁北工作。此次各防疫队在察北共治疗病牛七百七十六头，免疫注射七万四千二百一十九头；在冀察之赤城、四海等六县，治疗病牛一百一十头，免疫注射一万二千五百九十三头。两地共治病牛八百八十六头，免疫注射八万六千八百十二头。在防疫工作中，各队之技术人员及从事防疫工作之各级干部，大都吃苦耐劳，积极负责。如医生苏麟为赶制兔化毒疫苗，曾几夜不睡，白天还坚持工作，张垣牧畜场荆场长和医生唐春元等小组，连夜点灯注射，并创造了不少新办法：克服了蒸溜水、生理食盐水的缺乏困难，又自制冰箱，延长了疫苗有效期。地方干部在配合工作中也起了很大作用，察北县、区主要负责干部，都能深入群众进行宣传，认真组织封锁、隔离与集中牛群工作。由于医生、干部等全体人员的努力，使医疗速度由每日注射百头左右提高到三千余头的惊人的工作效率。同时，由于对农民进行了详尽的宣传，和实际工作成绩的影响，而破除了迷信，相信了科学，认识到党与人民政府对他们的关切，故争先恐后地从几十里外赶来请求注射，这也给长期防疫工作打下了良好的基础。　　　　（孙纪玉）
