Today's Dictionary

　　Coke Oven—A factory that turns smoky coal into coke through the combustion of its own gas. This kind of coke has a high heating power and is generally used in the iron and steel industry. Ordinarily, one ton of crushed coal can produce 1,400 *jin* of coke, and there are many by-products such as foul oil (also known as coal tar), green oil, red oil, middle oil, soft asphalt, hard asphalt, *biansu* oil, ammonia, naphthalene powder, carbolic acid, fertilizer powder, and more than two hundred other kinds (currently, the coke oven in Shijiazhuang in our district can only extract more than twenty kinds), which have great value in industry.

　　Altar Master—In superstitious secret societies, when receiving disciples, the person being received must buy some gifts, paper ingots, and sandalwood, and set up a table, which is called setting up the altar. The person who accepts disciples is called the altar master.

　　Initiation Master—In feudal superstitious Taoist sects, after receiving disciples, they write some strange characters that people cannot recognize, called "Buddhist scriptures." Then, they hang up a Buddha statue, and the preacher uses his finger to point at the Buddhist scripture and授(shou)gives it to the disciple. The person who points is called the Initiation Master.

　　Yellow Phosphorus—Made from animal bone ash or phosphate rock. It is a rod-shaped solid. Initially colorless, it turns yellow when exposed to light, and eventually becomes black. It is as soft as wax and easily ignites, so it should always be stored in water. In the dark, it can emit a bluish-white light, which is called phosphorescence. It is very easily soluble in carbon disulfide and is highly poisonous. It is used to make red phosphorus, phosphoric acid, and matches.

　　Potassium Chlorate—A chemical term, also called *yansusuan jiali*. It is a colorless plate-like crystal that is soluble in hot water. When mixed with flammable substances such as sulfur and antimony sulfide, it ignites very violently when rubbed. Therefore, it is used to manufacture matches, gunpowder, and dyes. It also has many uses in medicine.
