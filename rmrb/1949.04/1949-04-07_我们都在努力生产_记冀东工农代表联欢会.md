	We Are All Striving to Produce
	—A Record of the Jidong Worker-Peasant Representatives' Get-Together

　　The Jidong peasant visiting delegation arrived in Tangshan and received a warm welcome from all sectors of the Party, government, military, and people of the Jidong District and Tangshan City. On March 26th, a grand get-together was held at the Kailuan Company Club. Party and government leaders, as well as representatives of workers and students, attended the symposium. The venue was filled with the joy and brotherly love felt by the workers and peasants who had been liberated under the leadership of the Communist Party. After the leaders spoke in succession, Dong Fenghua, a female worker representative from the Huaxin Yarn Factory, said, "In the past, the Japanese invaders and the Kuomintang妄想 attempted to split the unity of workers and peasants, but we were not divided. Now, we are all striving to produce. Rural areas and cities are inseparable. If rural areas do not produce more cotton, how can we produce?" The worker representative of the Jibei Power Company recounted the restoration of their power plant and future production plans. The worker representative of the Tangshan Iron Factory denounced the Kuomintang reactionaries for only allowing them to manufacture guns and artillery and forbidding them to manufacture farm tools. Now they are planning to manufacture a large number of farm tools for the peasants. Li Guipu, a peasant from Qingping Second District, said, "I have broadened my horizons here and heard many truths. I will definitely take them back and call on everyone to produce more." Yang Zhenquan, a peasant from Qianxi Seventh District, said, "Our workers and peasants are as close as flesh and blood and will always be together. The workers use all kinds of machines to drive us forward. Worker brothers, walk ahead, and we will follow behind. We will definitely not lag behind. We must help each other and unite as one." Guan Lichang, a peasant from Qianxi Fourth District, said, "Before, we had not seen the lives of workers. We always felt that workers ate well, dressed well, and had no difficulties. Today we have seen their hard work, guarding such hot furnaces, working so fast, and so hard, while they are dressed in such rags. The fire in the kiln is so big, the molten iron is so red, and the female workers at the yarn factory are so quick at connecting the threads, which has really broadened my horizons." Gao Futian, a peasant from Qianxi Third District, said, "In the past, the Japanese devils and the Kuomintang implemented the 'Three Alls Policy,' with a stronghold every ten li. They burned houses eight times in a year and arbitrarily massacred us. But the more the enemy killed us, the more we fought them. If we sacrificed, others, our descendants, would avenge us. At that time, we hid in mountain caves every day, starving like ghosts. But we and the Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army were always united as one. We gave grain to the comrades, and we gave chaff to the comrades. The comrades also cared for the people in the same way, eating two bowls of rice when they should have eaten three, and eating one bowl when they should have eaten two, and giving us their clothes to wear. We shared weal and woe together for more than ten years." Cong Wenyong, a peasant from Qingping County Eighth District, envied the Soviet Union's machine farming and hoped that the city could supply the countryside with better farm tools. The peasants from Lulong County Third District proposed their plan for this year to dig more "foreign wells" and hoped that the workers of the iron factory would help. He said, "If everyone cooperates and has water, we are not afraid of poor production..." Wang Jichang, a peasant representative from the "no-man's land" in Chengde, spoke in a somber tone about the disasters inflicted upon them by the Japanese devils and the Kuomintang. He said, "From 1941, we did not farm for three years. Many people were killed by the devils, and the houses were burned down. From 1943, it was forbidden to live there. People were killed on sight. Even the leaves and thatch were burned by the enemy. The mountain caves were destroyed by water, and women, old people, and children were frozen to death. When the enemy smoked the mountain caves, we don't know how many people were burned to death. When we secretly planted some grain, it was destroyed before it sprouted. Now, we lack grain, farm tools, livestock, and fertilizer. Most of the villages are shacks built with a few sticks. More than a hundred households can only raise seven or eight sheep." He said that he was able to represent the "no-man's land" here, and the people there were moved to tears, all saying, "The government will never forget us." He asked the government to find more ways to solve the difficulties of the peasants in the "no-man's land." Everyone in the audience was very moved. (Jidong Branch)

　　我们都在努力生产
    ——记冀东工农代表联欢会
    冀东农民参观团到了唐山市，受到了冀东区及唐山市党政军民各界的热烈欢迎。三月二十六日在开滦公司俱乐部，举行了盛大的联欢会，参加座谈会的有党政军首长，还有工人、学生的代表，会场上充满了在共产党领导下得到解放的工人农民所感到的愉快和兄弟般的友爱。在各首长相继谈话后，华新纱厂女工代表董凤华说：“过去日寇和国民党妄想分裂工人和农民的团结，我们是没有被分裂的；现在，我们都在努力生产。农村和城市是分不开的，假如农村不多生产棉花，我们还能生产吗？”冀北电力公司的工人代表讲述了他们电厂的恢复情形和以后的生产计划。唐山铁工厂的工人代表控诉国民党反动派只让他们制枪炮，不准他们制造农具；现在他们正在计划要替农民制造大批的农具。青平二区农民李贵朴说：“我在这里开了眼界，听了很多的道理，我一定把它带回去，号召大伙多多生产。”迁西七区农民杨振全说：“咱们工人和农民血肉相连，永远在一起，工人用的全是机器，要来带动我们，工人大哥在前面走，我们跟在后面，我们一定不掉队，我们要互相帮助，团结一致。”迁西四区农民关利昌说：“以前我们没有见到工人生活，总觉着工人吃得好，穿得好，不困难，今天我们看到了他们这样的劳累，守在这样热的炉边，做得这样快，这样吃力，而他们穿的又是这样的破烂，窑里的火这么大，铁浆这样红，纱厂女工接线头时那样快，真使我长见识不少。”迁西三区农民高富田说：“过去鬼子和国民党实行三光政策，十里地一个据点，一年里就烧了八次房，任意屠杀我们，可是敌人越杀我们越和他干，牺牲了有别人，有后代给报仇，当时每天躲在山洞子里，饿得不象人，可是我们和共产党八路军是永远团结一心，有谷给同志谷吃，有糠给同志们糠吃，同志们也是同样爱护百姓，该吃三碗饭吃两碗，该吃两碗吃一碗，把自己的衣服给我们穿，我们一同共患难，一直到十几年。”青平县八区农民从文永很羡慕苏联机器耕田，他希望城市能供给乡村更好的农具。卢龙县三区农民则提出他们今年的计划，要多开“洋井”，希望铁工厂的工人帮忙。他说：“大家合作有了水，不怕生产不好………。”承德无人区农民代表王吉昌用沉痛的语调诉说日本鬼子和国民党给予他们的灾难，他说：“从一九四一年起，我们三年没有种地，很多人被鬼子杀死了，房屋给烧光了。一九四三年起，就不准住人，见人就杀，连树叶茅草都被敌人烧光了，山洞被水冲坏，妇女老少活活给冻死，敌人薰山洞时，也不知烧死多少人，偷着种点粮食，没出芽就给毁了。现在，我们缺乏粮食、农具、畜力和肥料，村子多是用几根棍子架的棚，一百多人家还只能养着七八只羊。”他讲到他能代表该地“无人区”到这里来参观，那里的人民都感动的落泪，都说“政府永远不会忘记我们。”他要求政府多多设法解决无人区农民的困难，会场上每一个人都很受感动。  （冀东分社）
