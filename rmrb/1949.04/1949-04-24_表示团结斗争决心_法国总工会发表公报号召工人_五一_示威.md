　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 23rd: TASS, Paris: The Executive Bureau of the French General Confederation of Labor issued a communiqué calling on all trade union organizations and working people to demonstrate on May Day to show the French working class's determination for solidarity and struggle, to achieve their demands, and to strive for freedom and peace. The Executive Bureau of the General Confederation of Labor expressed satisfaction with the results of the recent elections of worker representatives in factories, especially in mines. Despite repression and unfair election laws, they once again resolutely expressed their loyalty to the General Confederation of Labor, and their desire for solidarity and to fight for their legitimate demands. This is a major setback for the government's divisive conspiracy.

  　法国总工会发表公报号召工人“五一”示威
    【新华社北平二十三日电】塔斯社巴黎讯：法国总工会执行局发表公报，号召各工会组织和劳动人民在“五一”示威，表示法国工人阶级团结斗争，争取达到他们的要求，和争取自由与和平的决心。总工会执行局对于最近在工厂，特别是在矿厂中举行的工人代表选举的结果表示满意。尽管有镇压和不公平的选举法，他们仍然再度坚决地表示了他们忠于总工会，表示了他们团结与争取其合法要求的愿望。这是政府分裂阴谋的一个重大挫败。
