　　Strictly Prevent the Activities of Hidden Bandits and Special Agents!
　　Over Ten Citizens of Beiping Poisoned; Counterfeit Banknote Bandits Apprehended
　　[Beiping News] Kuomintang bandits and special agents hiding in this city are plotting to poison citizens with potent poisons to disrupt public order. According to a report from the 14th District Government, yesterday (6th), in the Erdao Street and Balizhuang areas outside Chaoyangmen in that district, bandits and special agents disguised themselves as vendors selling sweets, secretly adding poison. Li Song and others were poisoned to death, with a total of ten people poisoned. According to those who have recovered from the poisoning: around 9:00 am yesterday, a dark-faced, tall man dressed in a blue cotton casual outfit was selling sweets. A soldier from our People's Liberation Army machine gun squad bought and ate some, and immediately felt stomach pain, fortunately not severe. Later, Li Song and others found paper-wrapped sweets on the street and, thinking they had been lost by the vendor, picked them up and ate them. Three or four hours later, those who ate the sweets turned pale, felt weak in their limbs, dizzy, and uncomfortable. Upon receiving the report, the district government immediately took the poisoned people to the hospital for treatment, injecting antidote and cardiac stimulants. However, Li Song died despite seven injections due to being postpartum. The Municipal Public Security Bureau, upon learning of this, dispatched personnel to investigate and apprehend the perpetrators.
　　[This newspaper] Bai Wenxuan, former Deputy Commander of the Kuomintang bandit gang's Pseudo-Western Shandong Advance Army, Wang Yongquan, Major General and Director of the Ordnance Repair Shop of the Pseudo-92nd Army's 21st Division, and Qiu Yunchang, Second Lieutenant Adjutant of the Pseudo-92nd Army, were arrested by our Beiping Municipal Public Security Bureau for engaging in activities to undermine our financial and monetary credibility and counterfeiting Jinnan banknotes. As early as October of last year, the bandit Bai and others began printing counterfeit banknotes in the Pseudo-92nd Army Ordnance Repair Shop on Shifumajie Street, having already printed 30,000 one-thousand-yuan Jinnan notes. After the liberation of Beiping, our Public Security Bureau, after careful investigation, found four transceivers, one pistol, five bullets, and thirteen pieces of gold on Wang Yongquan at the repair shop. Due to the seriousness of the case, the criminals have been sent to the People's Court for punishment.
　　[Another News] Sun Bi, a dispersed soldier of the Kuomintang bandit gang, colluded with bandits to continuously commit thefts in Yanjia Hutong, Shitou Hutong Houhe, and other places since January. Later, he forged the seal and travel permits of the Xiaotangshan District Office of Changping County, attempting to plot sabotage activities, and was recently investigated and apprehended by our Beiping Municipal Public Security Bureau.
