Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 8th: The Tuanjie Bao [Solidarity News] reports: Demonstrations of protest were held throughout Italy on the 3rd, opposing the Fanfani anti-labor bill. The main point of this bill is to abolish the method of employing workers through trade unions, and instead to employ workers through the government, which is entirely for the benefit of employers. Hundreds of thousands of laboring people participated in demonstrations and protest meetings against the Fanfani bill. More than 80,000 people participated in the protest meeting in the province of Milan. On the 4th, various glass factories in Tuscany (central-western coast of Italy) went on strike for half an hour to express their protest. 30,000 laboring people attended the protest meeting in Bari.

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 7th: Rome dispatch: The Executive Committee of the Italian General Confederation of Labor has scheduled a special meeting today to discuss the statement made a few days ago by the Italian Minister of the Interior, Scelba, regarding the government's preparation to infringe on the freedom of trade unions. Regarding this matter, the secretary of the General Confederation of Labor issued a statement saying: Scelba's statement distorts the reasons for the working class's anxiety and attempts to defend the government's intention to seek benefits for Italian and foreign capital in the face of public opinion. It confirms the government's intention to use the police to weaken the laboring people and their trade unions. The laboring people are fighting for peace and demanding wage increases. The government openly and shamelessly interferes in the struggle of the laboring people in order to support employers at a time when the relationship between the Confederation of Italian Industry and the Italian General Confederation of Labor is particularly tense. Such interference will only hinder the resolution of disputes and make them more acute, because the laboring people will never give up defending their acquired rights and the freedom of trade unions by all means, nor will they tolerate the government's threats to use measures that violate democratic laws and encourage employers' stubborn attitude towards economic demands.

　　意政府无耻侵犯工人自由
  　全国劳动人民示威抗议
    总工会声明将坚决保卫已得权利
    【新华社北平八日电】团结报消息：意大利全国各地三日举行抗议示威，反对范凡尼反劳工法案。该法案的要点是要取消雇用工人必须通过工会的办法，而成为通过政府雇用工人，这是完全为了雇主的利益。成十万的劳动人民都参加示威和反范凡尼法案的抗议会议。米兰省的抗议大会有八万多人参加。四日，杜斯坎尼州（意中部西海岸）的各玻璃工厂停工半小时表示抗议。在巴利的抗议大会上有三万劳动人民出席。
    【新华社北平七日电】罗马讯：意大利总工会执委会定今日举行特别会议，讨论意政府内政部长谢尔巴日前所发表的关于政府准备侵犯职工会自由的声明。关于此事，总工会书记发表声明称：谢尔巴的声明，歪曲了工人阶级不安的原因，企图在舆论面前为政府给意大利及外国资本谋利益的意图辩护。它证实了政府利用警察以削弱劳动人民及其职工会的意图。劳动人民正在为和平及要求增加工资而战。政府公开而无耻地干涉劳动人民的斗争，以便在目前意大利工业家联合会和意大利总工会的关系特别紧张的时候，支持雇主。这种干涉只会阻挠争端的解决，使争端更形尖锐，因为劳动人民决不会放弃用一切手段保卫其已得权利和职工会的自由，也不会容忍政府使用违犯民主法律的措施的威胁和鼓励雇主们对经济要求的死硬态度。
