Xinhua News Agency, Kaifeng, 8th: The Henan Provincial People's Government is leading farmers to restore production to overcome the spring famine. In the past, under the Kuomintang's tyranny, the province invariably experienced minor famines every three years and major famines every ten years. Last year, the massive Kuomintang bandit troops harassed and destroyed the area, and some areas suffered crop failures due to rain in the autumn, so a spring famine has occurred in various places this spring. The first difficulty encountered in disaster relief and famine alleviation work is that some areas, especially severely ravaged disaster areas such as Liuhe District in Yongcheng, have a mentality of simply relying on government relief. Therefore, governments at all levels have dispatched personnel to carry out propaganda and mobilization, repeatedly explaining the principles of self-reliance in production, and improving farmers' production enthusiasm and confidence in overcoming the spring famine. At the same time, various places have made specific arrangements for production and disaster relief work based on their local conditions. Counties such as Yu County, Yiyang, Baofeng, Changge, Xihua, and Yongcheng have all set specific tasks. Some have proposed eliminating wasteland, while others have proposed more hoeing of wheat fields. For areas with severe disasters, the People's Government has also issued grain and funds to help disaster areas purchase seeds, cattle, and production tools. In order to solve the problem of farmers' livelihoods during the spring famine, various places have also organized mass sideline production and developed local specialties. Gong County is a cotton-producing area, and the government is supporting the cotton industry. The fourth district of the county has now cultivated and fertilized all 25,000 mu of cotton fields, waiting for the planting season. Lushan is a famous silk-producing area, and the county government has issued silk loans. Other examples include Yiyang organizing brick-making and papermaking; Zheng County supporting mat weaving and salt boiling; and Yancheng calling for vegetable planting and tree planting, all adopting methods to alleviate the spring famine. In addition to mobilizing mass production for disaster relief, government agencies and troops in various places are universally carrying out a movement to save resources and provide disaster relief. Staff in Yiyang County have decided to save one liang of millet per person per day for three months, April, May, and June, and have already saved 3,900 jin. The Chenliu Local Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has called on personnel from agencies and troops in nine counties to help the people with farming without exception, with each person cultivating half a mu to one mu, and stipulated that no temporary assignments are allowed during the spring plowing period. Baofeng County stipulates that during the spring plowing period, districts will not hold large meetings, and village meetings should not delay production.

　　河南人民政府组织生产渡荒
    【新华社开封八日电】河南省人民政府正领导农民恢复生产，以渡春荒。该省过去在国民党暴政下向来三年一小荒，十年一大荒。去年庞大的国民党匪军往返骚扰破坏，入秋部分地区又雨灾歉收，所以今春各地便发生春荒现象。在救灾渡荒工作中，首先遇到的困难，是有些地区尤其是受匪军蹂躏严重的灾区，如永城刘河区等，群众中存在一种单纯依赖政府救济的思想。因此，各级政府分派人员进行宣传动员，反复说明生产自救的道理，提高农民的生产情绪和战胜春荒的信心。同时，各地又都根据当地不同情况，具体布置生产渡灾工作。禹县、宜阳、宝丰、长葛、西华、永城等县，都各别地规定了任务，有的提出消灭荒地，有的提出多锄麦地，对于灾荒较重地区，人民政府并发放粮款，帮助灾区购买种籽、耕牛和生产工具。为解决春荒期农民的生活问题，各地又组织群众副业生产，发展地方特产。巩县为产棉区，政府就扶植棉业，现该县四区已将二万五千亩棉田全部耕好上粪，待时播种。鲁山为著名蚕丝产区，县府已发放蚕丝贷款。他如宜阳则组织烧磁、造纸；郑县则扶植编席、熬盐、郾城则号召种菜、植树，都各采办法，解救春荒。除发动群众性的生产救灾外，各地机关、部队正普遍地进行节约救灾运动。宜阳县工作人员决定在三、四、五三个月内，每人每天节约小米一两，现在已经节约了三千九百斤。中共陈留地方委员会号召九个县中的机关、部队人员无例外地助民耕作，每人耕半亩到一亩，并规定春耕期间，禁止拨差。宝丰县规定在春耕期间，区不召开大会，乡村开会也要不误生产。
