　　Great Chexing Village Relies on Grinding
  　To Overcome the Spring Famine
  　Early Action Brings Benefits
    [Chahar News] Relying on mutual aid in grinding rice and flour, Great Chexing Village in the eighth district of Huolu County has overcome the spring famine. Of the 173 households in the village severely affected by the disaster, they have already ground 470,000 jin of grain for the government, earning five jin of rice for every 100 jin of grain, totaling 23,500 jin of rice. In addition, 25 grinding stones were used to grind flour, earning 29,100 jin of rice, making a total of 52,600 jin of rice. This not only enabled the disaster-stricken households to overcome the spring famine, but also allowed them to buy seven or eight head of livestock, and more than ten households built new houses. Now, the work of grinding rice and flour has been handed over to women, while men concentrate their efforts on spring plowing. The village's success is due to the practical leadership of the district and village cadres. Last summer, the village suffered from drought, and then from floods in the autumn. Each mu only yielded four dou of grain. Among the more than 500 households in the village, one-third could only eat until the end of January this year. The district and village cadres immediately put forward the slogan of "early action," overcame the mentality of waiting, and organized to overcome the famine. The village immediately restored 23 large mills and 25 small grinding stones. The 173 households severely affected by the disaster formed six large groups, with production committee member Li Fuhong in charge, contacting outside parties and keeping accounts. After months of effort, they finally overcame the spring famine by contracting with Yuhua Store in the county and the second and third grain depots to grind rice, and with the military organs stationed there to grind flour.

　　大车行村依靠推磨
  　渡过春荒
  　下手早沾了光
    【察哈尔讯】依靠互助推米磨面，获鹿八区大车行村渡过春荒。全村一百七十三家灾荒严重户，已给公家推谷子四十七万斤，每百斤赚米五斤，共赚米二万三千五百斤；另外有二十五盘磨磨面，计赚米二万九千一百斤，两项共赚米五万二千六百斤。此不仅使灾荒户渡过春荒，并添买牲口七、八头，有十余户盖了新房子。现在，推米磨面已交妇女担任，男子则集中力量进行春耕。该村这一成绩之获得，乃因当地区村干部切实领导所致。该村去夏遭旱，秋后又遭水灾，每亩只打四斗谷，全村五百余户中，三分之一的户仅能吃到今年正月底。区村干部当即提出早下手的口号，克服等待心理，组织渡荒。全村当即恢复了二十三盘大碾、二十五盘小磨，重灾户一百七十三家组成六个大组，推生产委员李福红负责，对外接洽并记帐，当订下给本县裕华号及第二、三粮库推米，给驻军机关推面，经数月努力，终于渡过春荒。
