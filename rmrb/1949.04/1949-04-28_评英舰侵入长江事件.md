　　Commentary on the British Naval Ship Intrusion into the Yangtze River Incident
　　He Sijing
    The British ships HMS Amethyst, HMS Consort, HMS London, and HMS Black Swan forcibly passed through the People's Liberation Army's defense line in the Yangtze River and shelled the People's Liberation Army, indicating that the British imperialist government is attempting to armed intervention in China's internal affairs. According to an Associated Press report from London on the 21st, after the British ships had already ventured to attack the Chinese People's Liberation Army and suffered a powerful blow, the British Admiralty also admitted: "It is obviously not good for it (the Amethyst) to pass through the concentrated crossfire at this time." However, the British Admiralty cautiously remained silent about what purpose the Amethyst had for "passing through the concentrated crossfire at this time." And what time was this "passing through the concentrated crossfire"? This was precisely the day when the Kuomintang's reactionary Nanjing government had to indicate to the people whether it accepted or rejected the people's "Domestic Peace Agreement," that is, whether it would sign it. British imperialism passing through the concentrated crossfire of the warring parties in the Chinese civil war is by no means an ordinary, non-coercive action, but an abnormal, coercive action. This action must represent a will, and the more clearly the British flag is displayed, the more obvious it becomes: to stop the People's Liberation Army's actions and interfere in the Chinese civil war!
    The British Admiralty wants to conceal this attempt. But a British Foreign Office spokesman revealed a little, saying: "Britain has the consent of the Chinese government," and "the CCP is well aware that our warships are sailing up the river." Therefore, it seems that "Britain has the right to send warships into Chinese inland rivers" to infringe upon and damage Chinese sovereignty! But the British Foreign Office spokesman "knows very well" that the "Chinese government" he speaks of is a "government" that does not represent the will of the independent Chinese people, and "knows very well" that the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army have never recognized the right of imperialists to send warships into Chinese inland rivers. The British Foreign Office spokesman said that "the CCP is well aware that our (British) warships are sailing up the Yangtze River," which proves that the British side "knows very well" that the Chinese People's Liberation Army is preparing to cross the Yangtze River at this time, and also proves that the British side is attempting to make the Chinese People's Liberation Army stop its preparations for crossing the river in front of British warships, that is, to stop its action of taking over the Nanjing Kuomintang government's power and liberating all of China's just people's sovereignty. Moreover, this attempt by the British side has been expressed by the actions of its four warships, and the British Foreign Office spokesman has only expressed the attempt of this action with ambiguous implications. But this statement, after all, proves both that British imperialists are damaging Chinese sovereignty and that they do have the intention and action to undermine the principle that the Chinese people decide their own internal affairs according to their own will, and undermine the international principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries.
    The British Foreign Office spokesman only revealed a hint of the attempt, but the Daily Mail, a British Conservative Party newspaper, makes the British imperialist's attempt even more challenging to understand, writing: "The guns of the British ships give a warning to the whole of Asia: the lion is a peaceful animal when left undisturbed, but when provoked, it will show its teeth, and if necessary, use its teeth." The whole of Asia should pay close attention to the warning of the imperialist who calls himself this lion's challenge. The Daily Mail's words mean: All Asians should be good slaves of the imperialists, and if they want to be masters, it will "use its teeth." This passage by the British imperialist who calls himself a lion exposes the secret of the actions of the British ships HMS Amethyst, HMS Consort, HMS London, and HMS Black Swan, a secret that the British Labour government dares not reveal.
    However, this forced and emboldened intimidation by the British Conservatives is also quite pathetic. British imperialism has fallen to the status of a second-rate player in the world's reactionary camp, and still compares itself to the king of beasts, which can only make people laugh. It might be more appropriate to say that it is a deposed king of beasts, or rather, it is a fake lion, and will certainly not be more powerful than a paper tiger. The Asian people are not only not afraid of paper tigers and fake lions, but they are also not afraid to fight and subdue them, even if real lions and real tigers come. They have teeth, and now the Asian people know very well how to pull out their teeth.
    The fake lion said: "Asians should not think that the British flag and everything it represents can be insulted at will without fail." We Asians can remember that this sentence was said by your Conservatives, who are most opposed to the people, opposed to democracy, and opposed to peace. May I ask, does the British flag represent the British people? Or does it represent you, a group of anti-people, anti-democracy, and anti-peace aggressors? The flag of the British people is not your flag. Your flag should be abolished, and the flag of the true British people should be raised for the people of the world to see. You should not prevent the British people from raising their flag. But in fact, you either do not allow the British people to raise their flag, or you insist that your flag is the flag of the British people.
    The author firmly believes in the power of reason of the CCP and the People's Liberation Army. It has always declared its willingness to live in peace with all countries. But the author also firmly believes that it will never be subdued by violence. At this time, whoever plays with gunpowder risks self-immolation.

　　评英舰侵入长江事件
    何思敬
    英舰紫石英号、伴侣号、伦敦号和黑天鹅号在长江人民解放军防线内强行通过，并炮击人民解放军，表明英国帝国主义政府企图武装干涉中国内政。据美联社伦敦二十一日电，在英舰业已冒险进攻中国人民解放军并遭到了有力的打击之后，英海军部也承认：“要它（紫石英）在这个时候通过集中之炮火的夹击显然是不好的”。但英海军部却谨慎地噤口不谈紫石英会“在这个时候通过集中之炮火的夹击”究竟是为着一个什么目的。而且“通过集中之炮火的夹击”的这个时候是什么时候？这正是国民党南京反动政府必须向人民表示是否接受或拒绝人民底“国内和平协定”，即是否在其上签字的日子。英帝国主义在中国内战敌对双方集中炮火之夹击中通过，决不是普通的无强行性的行动，而是不正常的强行性的行动。这一行动必然代表一个意志，这个意志越把英国旗帜挂得明显就越加显明，就是要阻止人民解放军底行动，干涉中国内战！
    英海军部想掩盖这一企图。但英外部发言人却泄露了一点，他说：“英国获有中国政府的同意”，而且“中共很晓得我们的军舰沿江上驶”。因此，好似“英国就有权派军舰进入中国内河”侵犯与损害中国主权！但英外部发言人“很晓得”他所说的“中国政府”是不代表独立中国人民底意志的“政府”，“很晓得”中国共产党与人民解放军向来不承认帝国主义者有权利派军舰进入中国内河。英外部发言人既说“中共很晓得我们（英国）的军舰沿长江上驶”，那就证明英方“很晓得”中国人民解放军正在这个时候准备渡过长江，又证明英方企图要中国人民解放军在英国兵舰面前停止其渡江准备，即停止其接收南京国民党政府之权力与解放全中国之正义的人民主权的行动。而且英方这一企图已由它的四艘军舰底行动来表达了，英外部发言人不过用暧昧的言外之意来表达了这一行动底企图而已。但这一发言毕竟既证明英帝国主义者损害中国主权，又证明其确有企图和行动破坏了中国人以自己意志决定自己内政之原则，破坏了不得干涉他国内政之国际原则。
    英外部发言人只泄露了一点企图，但英保守党报纸每日写真报更挑战地令人了解英帝国主义底企图，它写道：“英舰的炮给全亚洲一个警告：狮子在不受打扰的时候是和平的动物，但被激而起，它将显示它的牙齿，并且如果有必要的话，使用它的牙齿。”全亚洲应该好好注意以这狮子自命的帝国主义者底挑战的警告。每日写真报的话就是说：全亚洲人应该好好做帝国主义者底奴隶，如果想做主人，它就要“使用它的牙齿”。以狮子自命的英帝国主义者底这段话暴露了英舰紫石英号、伴侣号、伦敦号、黑天鹅号底行动底秘密，英国工党政府所不敢泄露的秘密。
    不过英国保守党底这个强自壮胆的恫吓也煞是可怜。英帝国主义在世界反动阵营中已落到二等角色底地位，还以百兽之王自比，这只能令人失笑。说它是一只退位了的百兽之王，也许更恰当些，更毋宁说它是一只假狮子，而且决不会比纸老虎更利害些。亚洲人民不仅不怕纸老虎、假狮子，就是真狮子、真老虎来也不怕和它们搏斗而制服它们。它们有牙齿，现在亚洲人民很晓得把它们底牙齿拔掉。
    假狮子说：“亚洲人不要以为英国旗帜及其所代表的一切可以随意侮辱而万无一失。”我们亚洲人可以记住这句话是你们最反对人民、反对民主、反对和平的保守党人所说的。试问英国旗帜究竟代表英国人民呢？还是代表你们这批反人民、反民主、反和平的侵略分子？英国人民底旗帜并不是你们底旗帜。你们底旗帜应该作废，而真正英国人民底旗帜应该升起来给全世界人民看。你们不应妨碍英国人民举起他们底旗帜。但事实上你们或者不让英国人民举起他们底旗帜来，或者把你们底旗帜硬说做是英国人民底旗帜。
    作者深信中共与人民解放军富有理性的力量。它历来声明愿与一切国家和平相处。但作者亦深信，它决不为暴力所屈服。在这个时候，谁要玩弄火药，谁就有自焚的危险。
