　　Restore Water Conservancy in Yongnian and Other Counties
  　Jinnan Orders First Batch of 100 Waterwheels
    [Our Newspaper] In order to meet the urgent needs of farmers in restoring and developing water conservancy, the Jinnan Water Conservancy Promotion Agency recently ordered the first batch of 100 waterwheels from ten public and private iron factories in Handan City, including Tai Mao and Da Xin. The Handan Municipal Administration for Industry and Commerce specially helped various iron industrial households to delineate a unified style to facilitate farmers' repairs, and led the iron factories to propose quality guarantees to the purchasers. The factories also independently set out to oppose shoddy work and materials and strive to improve quality. In order to help the factories develop, the Promotion Agency paid all the set prices. On March 24, both parties officially signed the contract. Yongnian, Jize, Nanhe and other counties in Jinnan have natural water conservancy conditions, and the masses have always had the habit of digging wells for water. There is a saying, "Nanhe and Renxian do not rely on the sky" (meaning that they can grow crops even without rain). After ten years of destruction and plunder by the enemy and bandits, the masses' management strength has declined, the water wells have fallen into disrepair, and the waterwheels are incomplete. Yongnian County alone has 40,000 old water wells, but only 6,900 waterwheels, and many are missing buckets and frames. After the land reform, the fertile land and water wells were owned by the farmers, and the North China People's Government clearly ordered that the burden of dry land becoming irrigated land would not change for three years. Farmers are eager to develop water conservancy, but lack the ability to independently add waterwheels. Therefore, the Jinnan Water Conservancy Promotion Agency, based on the instructions given by the Head Office, decided to help farmers repair and add 4,000 waterwheels before May. The Promotion Agency also purchased the first batch of water bucket raw materials to help repair old cars and add water buckets, which is a great help for farmers to quickly restore and develop water conservancy.

　　恢复永年等县水利
  　冀南订购第一批水车百辆
    【本报讯】冀南水利推进社，为应目前农民恢复发展水利的急需，日前特向邯郸市太茂、大新等十家公私铁工厂订购第一批水车一百辆。邯市工商管理局特帮助各铁工业户划出统一样式，便于农民修理，并领导各铁厂向购户提出保证质量。各厂间亦自行定出反对偷工减料、力求提高质量。推进社为帮助各厂发展，并将定价全部交付。三月二十四日，双方已正式签订合同。按冀南永年、鸡泽、南和等县，有天然的水利条件，群众素有凿井用水习惯，有“南和任县不靠天”俗语（意即不下雨也能种地），十年来经敌匪摧残掠夺，群众经营力量下降，水井失修，水车残缺，永年一县即有旧水井四万眼，而水车却只有六千九百辆，且多缺斗子、缺架子。土地改革后，肥沃的土地和水井为农民所有，我华北人民政府又明令旱地变水地三年不变负担，农民迫切要求发展水利，但又缺乏独立添置水车的能力。因此冀南水利推进社，根据总社所给指示，决于五月前帮助农民修添水车四千辆。推进社又代购到第一批水斗原料，帮助修理旧车添置水斗，这对农民迅速恢复发展水利是一大帮助。
