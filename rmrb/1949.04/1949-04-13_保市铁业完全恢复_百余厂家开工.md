[Jizhong Electric] The iron factories and oil presses in Baoding City, which were destroyed by the Kuomintang reactionaries, have restored and developed production after liberation, under the leadership of the People's Government and with the key support of the People's Bank through loans and procurement. The number of iron factories in the city has increased from 135 with 408 workers and apprentices at the time of liberation to 143 with 538 workers and apprentices. From December last year to March this year, they have produced 95 waterwheels, and 50 spinning machines and bellows. In terms of sales, the People's Government and the bank purchased 14 waterwheels, 110,000 jin of cottonseed cakes, sesame oil cakes, and sesame paste. As a result, the iron factories and workshops have been able to continue to expand their operations. According to statistics, Tong Shengde alone produced 31 large and small waterwheels (7 small waterwheels), 750 waterwheel buckets, 220 water tanks, pots, shovels, and other farm tools weighing over 72,000 jin, and 337,000 jin of various bean cakes in just two months.
