　　A New Creation of War Zone Culture in Northern Henan

　　"Study when not fighting, strive to improve culture!" -- In Shen Xiaoying's trenches, this is no longer a beautiful colored slogan, but the most moving objective reality.
　　In order to enable illiterate comrades to quickly grasp culture, in addition to general teaching methods, they have also created many new methods. One such method, used by the Second Company, is to write combat tasks and slogans on small wooden signs and insert them on one side of each intersection, allowing squad leaders to teach them. Another method, used by Shen Zhanping, the study group leader of the artillery squad of the First Company, is to write poems composed by comrades on the walls near their fortifications and then teach illiterate comrades to imitate them on the side. But an even better method is the "Literacy Poker" created by Zhang Xiusheng, the study group leader of the Sixth Squad of the Third Company.
　　The content of this "Literacy Poker" is determined according to the current work tasks and the needs of the comrades. The number of characters and the number of cards are determined according to the learner's level and the number of people. For example, they wrote twenty-four characters such as: "Hold the position, control the airport," "Grasp the enemy's throat," "Liberate Xinxiang, capture Li Zhenqing alive," "Prevent sabotage and rumors," "Cross the Yangtze River," etc. At first, they taught the comrades to recognize the characters several times, and then they copied each character onto a piece of soft paper for each card.
　　When playing, like playing poker, the cards are shuffled and dealt to four or six people in turn until they are all dealt out. After dealing, the first player plays the first card and asks the next player to recognize it. If the next player does not recognize it, the third player is asked to recognize it. If the third player recognizes it, they play a card from their hand. If no one around the third player recognizes it, the player who played the card must tell them what the character is and then continue playing. If they also don't recognize it, the teacher is asked to teach them, and the right to play passes to the next player.
　　In this way, those who study well can play their cards early, while those who do not study hard play their cards later, or cannot play them completely. After several rounds, if everyone recognizes the characters, the content is changed. By adopting this method, they taught everyone twenty or thirty new characters in three or four days, breaking the previous record for recognizing new characters.
　　Since this method was introduced, illiterate comrades have been as happy as if they had received the gospel. It quickly spread from one squad to the entire platoon. Now, not only has the Third Company fully adopted this method, but it is also being disseminated to other companies and battalions through their brigade's "Quick Report."

　　识字扑克
  　豫北战地文化新创造
    史洪
    “不打仗就学习，为提高文化而努力!”——这在沈小营的战沟里，早已不是漂亮的彩色标语，而是最动人的客观实际。
    他们为了使不识字的同志很快的掌握文化，除一般的教法，又创造了好多新方法，一种如二连把战斗的任务和口号写成一个个小木牌插在每个交叉口的一边，让各班学习组长去教；一种如一连炮班学习组长申占平的办法，是把同志们伙编的诗歌，写在靠近他们工事的墙上，然后教不识字的同志在一边摩仿；而更好的却是三连六班学习组长张秀生同志创造出来的一种带娱乐性的“识字扑克”。
    这“识字扑克”的内容，是根据当前的工作任务与同志们的需要而确定的，其字数多少与牌数多寡，是依要者的程度、人数而确定的。比如他们写了：“坚持阵地控制飞机场”“卡住敌人脖子”“解放新乡，活捉李振清”“防止破坏谣言”“过长江”等二十四个字。一开始，是教同志们认几遍，然后即以一片片的软纸把每张上都抄上一个字。
    在要时，如打扑克一样，把牌搅乱，由四个或六个人轮摸，一直摸完。摸完后，由起头牌者出第一张，让其下手去认，如其下手不认识，即改第三者认；若第三者认得，即出他自己手里牌，如第三者周围都不认得，出牌者得告诉这是什么字，然后继续出牌，如他也不认得，即请先生教给，出牌权利转其下手。
    这样，学习好的，即把牌早早推出，而不好好学习的，就推出较迟，或不能完全推出。经过轮番数次，如都认会了，即改换新的内容。他们采用了这种办法，三四天之内，就教会了每个人二三十个生字，打破了以往认生字的纪录。
    自从有这种办法以后，不识字的同志如得福音一样，很快的由一个班传遍了全排，现在三连不仅完全采用了这办法，而且经过他们旅的“快报”在向其它的连队与团营传播着。
