　　The Significance of "Taking Both Public and Private Interests into Account"
    Question: What is the significance of "taking both public and private interests into account"?
    Answer: "Taking both public and private interests into account" has two meanings: First, in terms of the relationship between state-owned enterprises and private enterprises, state-owned enterprises occupy a leading position in the national economy, but at the same time, private enterprises should be allowed to engage in and develop activities that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood. The people should, according to the specific conditions of various regions, industries, and periods, impose appropriate restrictions on private enterprises in terms of their scope of activities, tax policies, market prices, and labor conditions. This is what the people's interests require; however, these restrictions should not suffocate private enterprises, but should allow private enterprises to have the opportunity to obtain legitimate profits under certain conditions. This is also what the people's interests require. Therefore, it is called taking both public and private interests into account. The other meaning of this phrase refers to the relationship between workers and the state in the state-owned enterprises of people's democratic countries. Here, the workers themselves are the masters of the enterprise, the interests of the enterprise are public, and the personal interests of the workers are private. The administrative management personnel within the enterprise should take care of the workers in terms of wages, labor conditions, and welfare, while the workers should abide by labor discipline, improve labor techniques, cherish tools, save raw materials, increase production, and improve quality to increase the interests of state-owned enterprises.

　　“公私兼顾”的意义
    问：“公私兼顾”的意义是什么？
    答：“公私兼顾”有两种意义：一是就国营企业与私营企业的关系来说，国营企业在国民经济中处于领导地位，但同时应允许私人企业作有益于国计民生的活动和发展。人民对于私营企业，应在活动范围、税收政策、市场价格、劳动条件等方面，根据各地、各业和各个时期的具体情况，予以恰如其分的限制，这是人民利益所要求的；但是，这些限制又不应达到窒息私营企业的程度，而应使私营企业在一定条件之下仍有获得正当利润的机会，这也是人民利益所要求的。所以叫做公私兼顾。此语的另一种意义是就人民民主国家的国营企业中职工与国家的关系说的。这里职工自己就是企业的主人，企业的利益是公，职工个人的利益是私。企业内的行政管理人员应在工资、劳动条件、福利事业等方面照顾职工，而职工则应遵守劳动纪律，改进劳动技术爱护工具节省原料，增加产量、提高质量，以增加国营企业的利益。
