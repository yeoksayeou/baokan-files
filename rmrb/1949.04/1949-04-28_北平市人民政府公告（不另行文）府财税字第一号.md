Announcement of the Peiping Municipal People's Government (No Separate Document) Municipal Finance and Taxation Letter No. 1

Regarding the announcement of fixed salary income tax rates:

It has been determined by this government that the tax rates for fixed salary income tax for public educators, police officers, and employees of public and private enterprises in this city will be collected starting from April of this year. The relevant details are hereby announced for reference by all agencies, schools, and public and private enterprises.

1.  Salary income tax will be levied starting from April of this year.

2.  The salary income tax will be calculated based on the equivalent amount of millet (jin) for each person's monthly salary. The current market price at the time of salary distribution will be used to convert it into currency for collection. If the salary is originally issued in currency converted from millet prices, the tax amount will be calculated based on the millet price at the time of issuance.

3.  The salary income tax is tentatively set at 250 jin of millet as the tax-free threshold. Income below 250 jin is exempt from tax, and income above 250 jin will be taxed on the excess portion. The tax rate will be progressive, ranging from 4% to 15%. The tax brackets and calculation formulas are as follows:

    Salary Income (Millet)　Tax Rate　Tax Calculation Formula (X = Salary Income)
    251 jin - 350 jin　4%　0.04X - 10 jin
    351 jin - 450 jin　5%　0.05X - 13.5 jin
    451 jin - 600 jin　7%　0.07X - 22.5 jin
    601 jin - 750 jin　9%　0.09X - 34.5 jin
    751 jin - 900 jin　12%　0.12X - 57 jin
    Above 900 jin　15%　0.15X - 84 jin

    Note: ⒈ Salary income with fractions less than one jin will not be taxed.
    　　　⒉ Round off the second decimal place.

4.  For employees of public and private enterprises whose food and lodging are provided by factories and shops, the value of food and lodging will be calculated as 150 jin of millet. If their net salary exceeds 100 jin of millet per month, the excess portion will be taxed at the same rates as above.

5.  Salary income tax shall be withheld by each salary-issuing unit at the time of salary distribution. Within five days after salary distribution, the withheld tax amount shall be declared to the Municipal Taxation Bureau using the prescribed forms. The Taxation Bureau will then issue a payment voucher for immediate payment into the treasury.
