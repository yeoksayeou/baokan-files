　　Australian Dockworkers Strike
　　Protest "Trial" of Australian Communist Leader
　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 2nd: Reports from various sources: The Australian Waterside Workers' Federation, with 23,000 members, went on strike for one day on March 27 to protest the so-called "trial" of Sharkey, General Secretary of the Communist Party of Australia, by the Sydney Federal Special Court. Because Sharkey's speech supporting the declaration of the French Communist leader Thorez seriously struck a blow to the schemes of the Australian warmongers, the Sydney Special Court, on March 30, on the pretext that Sharkey had committed the so-called crime of "publishing seditious words," decided to hand him over to the criminal court for "trial." Sharkey's defense lawyer denounced this "trial" in court as illegal political persecution against Sharkey.

　　澳码头工人罢工
  　抗议“审讯”澳共领袖
    【新华社北平二日电】各方报导：拥有两万三千会员的澳大利亚码头工人工会，于三月二十七日罢工一日，以抗议悉尼联邦特种法庭对澳共总书记夏基的所谓“审讯”。由于夏基支持法共领袖多列士声明的演说严重的打击了澳洲战争贩子地计谋，悉尼特种法庭于三月三十日借口夏基犯有所谓“发表煽动言词”之罪，决定将他交与刑事法庭“审讯”。夏氏辩护律师在法庭上斥责这种“审讯”，是对夏基施行非法的政治迫害。
