　　National Democratic Women's Federation Chairman
　　Comrade Cai Chang Calls on Women to Fully Support the Advance Order
    [Report from this newspaper] Comrade Cai Chang, Chairman of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, gave a radio address on the 22nd, calling on women across the country to fully support the People's Liberation Army's advance. Her speech is as follows:
    Women compatriots,

    In order to achieve true peace in all of China, the Chinese Communist Party delegation and the Kuomintang delegation conducted peace negotiations in Beiping and drafted a domestic peace agreement, but the Nanjing Kuomintang government completely rejected it. This shows that the Nanjing Kuomintang government completely obeyed the orders of American imperialism and the bandit leader Chiang Kai-shek, using a false peace conspiracy to cover up the Kuomintang reactionaries' attempt to gain a breathing space, vainly attempting to stage a comeback and strangle the revolution.

    Chairman Mao Zedong and Commander-in-Chief Zhu De, in order to liberate all of China, in order to ensure the realization of true and lasting peace throughout the country, issued an advance order yesterday. I, on behalf of the broad masses of women in China, resolutely and warmly support this order. Less than half a day after the order was issued, our heroic People's Liberation Army began the battle to resolutely, thoroughly, cleanly, and completely annihilate the enemy. On the 21st, 300,000 troops had already crossed the Yangtze River. The People's Liberation Army on the Taiyuan front launched a general offensive, and in the first battle alone, annihilated six enemy divisions. Women compatriots! What exciting news!

    We women in the liberated areas must use all our strength to support the People's Liberation Army, liberate the men and women compatriots in the south of the Yangtze River, and liberate all the Chinese people. In the rear, women in both cities and villages must work hard to participate in production and construction to meet the material needs of the military and civilians. We must also frequently write letters to the People's Liberation Army on the front lines to express our condolences and encourage them to fight heroically with all their hearts to fulfill the orders of Chairman Mao Zedong and Commander-in-Chief Zhu De. Sisters on the front lines should work even harder to participate in supporting the front lines and logistics, and take over the production tasks completed by men. Sisters who are still in the Kuomintang-controlled areas should appropriately carry out various tasks to disintegrate the Kuomintang reactionary army and reactionary government, advise their husbands, sons, brothers, and fathers not to be driven by the Kuomintang reactionaries, and try their best to protect factories, schools, and all social constructions, so as to prepare forces to welcome the arrival of the People's Liberation Army and overthrow the Kuomintang reactionary rule.

    Women compatriots! Thanks to the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the heroic and skillful fighting of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and the unprecedentedly strong power of the Chinese people, the liberation of the whole country is not far away! I hope that all our women compatriots will continue to struggle, contribute all our strength to support the People's Liberation War, and promote the early realization of national victory.

　　全国民主妇联会主席
  　蔡畅同志号召妇女全力支援进军命令
    【本报讯】中华全国民主妇女联合会主席蔡畅同志，二十二日广播演讲，号召全国妇女全力支援解放军进军，其演词如下：
    妇女同胞们：
    为着实现全中国的真正和平，中国共产党代表团在北平和国民党代表团进行和平谈判，拟订了国内和平协定，但是南京国民党政府完全拒绝了。这表示了南京国民党政府完全服从了美帝国主义及匪首蒋介石的命令，以虚伪的和平阴谋掩护国民党反动派取得喘息机会，妄想实现卷土重来扼死革命的诡计。
    毛泽东主席和朱总司令，为着解放全中国，为着保证在全国范围内实现真正的持久和平，昨天颁布了进军命令，我代表全中国广大妇女群众坚决地热烈地拥护这个命令。这个命令发表不到半天。我们英勇的人民解放军开始了坚决彻底干净全部歼灭敌人的战斗，二十一日已有三十万大军横渡长江。太原前线的人民解放军发动了总攻，第一仗就消灭了敌人六个师。妇女同胞们！这是多么令人兴奋的捷报！
    我们解放区的妇女要用全力支援人民解放军，解放江南的男女同胞，解放全中国人民。在后方，不论城市和乡村的妇女，都要努力参加生产建设，满足军民的物资需要；我们还要经常向前线人民解放军写信慰问，鼓励他们全心全意为实现毛泽东主席朱总司令的命令而英勇战斗。在前线的妇女同胞更加努力参加支援前线和后勤工作，接替男子完成生产任务。现在还在国民党统治区的姐妹们，应该适当地进行各种工作，以瓦解国民党反动军队反动政府，劝告自己的丈夫子弟父兄不要受国民党反动派驱使，尽力设法保护工厂、学校及一切社会建设，以便准备力量，迎接人民解放军到来，推翻国民党反动统治。
    妇女同胞们！由于中国共产党的英明领导，中国人民解放军的英勇善战，中国人民力量空前强大，全国解放为期不远了！希望我们全体妇女同胞继续奋斗，贡献一切力量支援人民解放战争，促进全国胜利早日实现。
