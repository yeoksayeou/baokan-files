　　Relying on the Strength of the Working Class, Yuhua Machine Factory Grows
　　By Our Reporter Tian Liu
　　The people need various industries, and even more so the machine manufacturing industry; the people need various machines, especially machines that make machines.
　　Shijiazhuang has a Yuhua Machine Factory, second only to the railway machine factory in terms of equipment and scale. Now it can manufacture five important machine tools and many other machines every month. In fact, it has been established for less than a year!
　　Last March, the Shijiazhuang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China gave Comrade Wu Guanghua the task of establishing a machine factory, allocating him four lathes, one planer, a factory site that had been used as a wool weaving factory during the Japanese imperialist occupation, and a dozen workers and a dozen apprentices, and finally a little scrap iron. Old Wu and nearly thirty workers and apprentices took those five machines to the new factory, but what kind of factory was this! All the houses either had roofs open to the sky, or were missing a wall, and none of the houses had doors or windows; the five machines were all old, toothless old men. Everything was very difficult, lacking everything, short of everything, even drinking water required digging a well first!
　　However, none of the thirty people were discouraged, and none of them bowed their heads to the difficulties.
　　This Old Wu, who had gone through twenty years of revolutionary struggle, mobilized everyone and said: "Comrades, this is our world now. No matter how great the difficulties were in the past, we still had to overcome them. What is this little difficulty now?" Some of the thirty employees came from old liberated areas, and they were also well-trained. The newly liberated workers had also undergone arduous struggles under the oppression and exploitation of the Japanese invaders, the Kuomintang, and capitalists. Therefore, everyone said with confidence: "We workers have always relied on our own hands to create the world. Now, let's create our own factory!" So thirty people started working together, first digging wells for water, then repairing doors and windows and building workshops. Fitter Yang Xi耕 (who has now been promoted to deputy director) led the way in assembling machines and making tools. Old Wu worked hard all day and patrolled every corner of the factory at night to prevent saboteurs from damaging it. With the active efforts of more than thirty employees, they built the factory in just over a month, and in May, they produced half a lathe. The thirty people were so happy that they couldn't close their mouths. Comrades said: "If we can produce half, we can produce ten or a hundred. As long as we can produce, everything is victory." Everyone's spirits were even higher, and a vigorous production movement began. By October, they were already able to produce two to three lathes per month.
　　In early November, after crushing the Kuomintang bandit gang's conspiracy to sneak attack Shijiazhuang, the Yuhua Machine Factory returned. When all the employees returned to the factory that they had rebuilt with their own hands and wisdom, they were ecstatic. In just three days, they completed the resumption of work and factory construction plan that would have taken two weeks. Then, they launched a production increase competition movement. Machine apprentice Jia Ziqiang persisted in working for twenty hours at a stretch to complete the manufacture of the large machine wheel; worker Wang Chengying had something to do at home and had already asked for leave, but seeing that it was still early, he added two hours of voluntary work before leaving; worker Liu Hongxin saw that the main shaft had moved, so he added half a day of voluntary work during everyone's Sunday break to repair it; none of the employees lagged behind, and everyone was more active than the other. They not only forgot their fatigue and used their hands to compete in production, but also carried out intellectual competitions. Technician Liu Zhijing studied and put "gear wheels" of the same size on the lathe at the same time, and the output increased by more than two times at once; fitter section chief Li Faxiang reorganized the planer workers and implemented a three-shift system, and the output also increased by one time; in addition, there were many small but valuable inventions, creations, and suggestions, some of which increased output, some of which improved quality, and some of which saved raw materials and improved working conditions.
　　In this way, due to the selfless production of all the employees and the full play of the proletarian's unique creativity, the production task for two months was completed in thirty-five days, making up for the loss of half a month of work stoppage during the preparation for war. When Shijiazhuang summarized this production increase competition movement this March, the Yuhua Machine Factory won first prize, and the Shijiazhuang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Municipal People's Government, and the Federation of Trade Unions jointly awarded the banner of "Produce More Machines and Strive for the Industrialization of China." The Yuhua Machine Factory should be rewarded by the people. Even in such simple, incomplete, and difficult conditions, but because it truly relied on the working class and gave full play to the political enthusiasm of all employees, it not only quickly established and developed the factory, but also produced twelve large lathes and one hundred and four special machines in five months last year. This March, it produced five such lathes. With the development of production, the Yuhua Machine Factory itself has also grown stronger. When it was first founded in April last year, it only had four lathes and one planer. By the end of the year, it already had ten various lathes, four planers, one washer, four drills, and an electric motor of 23 H.P. The number of employees has also expanded from thirty to one hundred and six.
　　The people in the liberated areas—the people who have realized land reform and abolished the feudal system—their lives have been greatly improved. They need various industries, especially the machine industry to replace the slow handicraft industry. Therefore, they need various machines, especially machines that make machines. This is very obvious. As long as there are machines that make machines, there will be not just one or two, but many, many. It is precisely for this reason that the products of the Yuhua Machine Factory are in great demand. The city, central Hebei, and other places are all vying to buy them, and even need to order in advance to get the machines in order. Therefore, at the beginning of this year, the Yuhua Machine Factory formulated a "Two-Year Development Plan" based on the existing foundation and this need. The plan states that by the end of the year, its equipment will develop to four times its current capacity to manufacture machines.
　　On April 7th, when the reporter visited the factory, it was expanding its workshops and installing new machines. In the first quarter of this year, it had already added three new shaper planers and six lathes (four of which were eight feet and two of which were five feet) and one large universal washer. Now, in order to welcome the People's Liberation Army crossing the Yangtze River and celebrate their own festival—the "May Day" Labor Day, they are making preparations in all aspects to launch a new production competition movement in Red May! Manufacture more and better machines!

　　依靠了工人阶级的力量裕华机器厂成长起来了
    本报记者  田流
    人民需要各种工业，更需要机器制造工业；人民需要各种机器，尤其需要制造机器的机器。
    石家庄有个裕华机器工厂，设备和规模仅次于铁路机厂，现在它一个月能制造五部重要的工作母机和很多别的机器。一其实，它建立起来还不满一年呢！
    去年三月，中共石家庄市委给了吴光华同志建立一个机器工厂的任务，并拨给他四部元车一部刨床，一所在日本帝国主义侵占时代曾作过毛织工厂的厂址，及十多个工人和十多个学徒，最后还有一点烂铁。老吴和近三十个工人学徒带着那五部机器到了新工厂，但这是个怎样的工厂啊！所有的房子不是能抬头望天，就是少了一面墙壁，而且，没有一间房子是有门窗的；五部机器呢，也都是老的没有牙齿的老头子了，一切都很困难，用甚没甚，缺东少西，连喝水全要自己先挖井哩！
    可是，他们三十个人谁也没有泄气，谁也没有向困难低头。
    这位经过二十来年革命斗争的老吴，便动员大家说：“同志们，这是我们的天下了，过去再大的困难还要克服了，现在这点困难算什么呢？”三十个职工有些是老解放区来的，他们也是老有锻炼的，那些新解放的工人，也曾在日寇、国民党、资本家的压迫剥削下进行过艰苦的斗争的。因此，大家都有信心地说：“咱们工人从来就是靠着双手创造天下的。现在，创造咱们自己的工厂吧！”于是三十个人就一齐动起手来了，先挖了水井有水喝，又修门窗、盖工房，钳工工人杨希耕（他现在升任了副厂长）领着头儿装机器造工具。老吴白日劳作一天，晚上还要在工厂各个角落里巡查，防备歹人破坏。在三十多个职工积极努力下，仅仅一个多月的时间，他们就把工厂建立了起来，五月份便开始出了半部车床，三十个人欢喜的简直合不上嘴，工友同志们说：“能出半部，就能出十部百部，只要能生产，一切都是胜利。”大家情绪更高啦，热火朝天的生产运动开始了，到十月份，已经能够每月生产两部到三部的圆车了。
    十一月初，粉碎国民党匪帮偷袭石家庄的阴谋后，裕华机器厂又回来了。当全体职工又回到自己双手和智慧重建起来的工厂时，他们兴奋地发狂了，仅仅三天的时间，就完成了两个礼拜才能完成的复工建厂计划，接着便掀起了增产竞赛运动。机工学徒贾自强为完成大机器轮的制造，一口气坚持了二十个小时的工作；工人王承盈家中有事，已经请了假，看看天气还早，又加了两小时的义务工才走；工友刘鸿信看见大轴有了移动，趁大家星期日休工的时候，多加半天的义务工把它修好；全体职工谁也不落后，一个比一个积极，他们不光忘了疲劳的用双手比赛生产，还开展智力比赛。技术工人刘志经研究将同样大小的“牙轮”同时上在车床上，产量一下子提高了两倍多；钳工股长李发祥将刨车工人重新组织，实行三班制，产量也提高了一倍；另外还有很多小的，但是却很有价值的发明创造和建议，有的增加了产量，有的提高了质量，有的节省了原料和改善了工作条件。
    就是这样，由于全体职工的忘我生产，和无产阶级所特有的创造性的充分发挥，三十五天便完成了两个月的生产任务，弥补了备战期间停工半月的损失。今年三月石家庄总结这次增产竞赛运动时，裕华机器厂得了一等奖，中共石家庄市委、市人民政府和总工会联合颁给：“多多生产机器，为工业化中国而努力”的大旗。裕华机器厂是应该受到人民的奖励的，虽在那样简陋的残缺不全的困难情况下，但由于切实地依靠了工人阶级，发挥了全体职工政治积极性，不仅把工厂很快建立和发展起来，并且，在去年五个月内，生产了十二部大型元车机床、一百零四部专用机器。今年三月份，则生产了五部那样的元车。随着生产的发展，裕华机器厂自己也壮大起来了，去年四月刚创办时，只有四部元车，一部刨床，到年底就已经有各种元车十部、刨车四部、洗车一部、钻车四部、电动机２３．Ｈ．Ｐ．了，职工也由三十人扩充到一百零六人。
    解放区的人民一一实现了土地改革、废除了封建制度之后的人民，生活都大大的改善了，他们是需要各种工业的，特别需要机器工业来代替迟缓的手工业，因此他们需要各种机器，尤其需要制造机器的机器。这道理是很明显的，只要有了这种制造机器的机器，不是一部两部而是很多很多。正是这个原故，裕华机器厂的产品是供不应求的，本市、冀中及其他别的地方都争着来买，甚至先要订购，才能按次序的得到机器。因此，今年初，裕华机器厂就在现有的基础上，根据着这种需要，订出了一个“两年发展计划”，该计划标出：到年底，它的设备将发展到四倍于今的制造机器的机器。
    四月七日，记者访问该厂时，它正扩充工房、安装新的机器，在今年的第一季里，已经新添了三部牛头刨车，元车六部（内八英尺者四部，五英尺者两部）大万能洗车一部。现在，他们为欢送解放军南渡长江，迎接自己的节日——“五一”劳动节，正从各方面进行准备，以掀起红五月的新的生产竞赛运动！制造出更多的更好的机器出来！
