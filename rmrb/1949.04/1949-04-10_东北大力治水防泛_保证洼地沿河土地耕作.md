Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 8th. The provinces of Northeast China are vigorously organizing the people to manage water and prevent floods, so as to avoid flooding of inland rivers and ensure the cultivation of the vast amount of low-lying and riverside lands. The Water Conservancy Bureau of the Agricultural Department of the Northeast Administrative Committee has successively dispatched a large number of personnel to various provinces to survey river embankments and assist the provincial water conservancy bureaus in organizing people to prevent floods in a planned manner. In Songjiang Province, in addition to establishing water conservancy committees in six counties, including Wuchang, Tonghe, Yanshou, Hailin, Shangzhi, and Ning'an, to protect the original water conservancy projects, it has also mobilized farmers in various districts to dig moats and build dams to drain water and prevent waterlogging. In order to prevent spring floods in the Niuhe River within its borders, Lalin County has recently processed and repaired water conservancy facilities to protect more than 500 hectares (1 hectare = 10 mu) of dry land and 300 hectares of paddy fields from disasters. When the water conservancy project is completed, it can also expand the paddy field area by 700 hectares. The Hunhe River water conservancy project in Liaoning Province, which is funded by the state, has also started construction in most areas. When completed, it can protect tens of thousands of hectares of fertile land from floods and restore more than 10,000 hectares of paddy fields, which is estimated to increase rice production by 40,000 tons. Five other major projects in the province have also been surveyed and are scheduled to start construction in early this month. Xinmin County in Liaobei Province is building a 96-li-long Liaohe River embankment across its territory, which is expected to require more than 300,000 man-days of labor and will be completed soon. The construction of this embankment can protect 33,000 hectares of fertile land and 35 villages along the river from floods. In order to prevent flooding in the middle and lower reaches of the Tao'er River, Nenjiang Province is carrying out deployment and repair work. The work of preventing spring floods in inland rivers in Heilongjiang, Jilin, and Hejiang provinces has already begun.

　　东北大力治水防泛
  　保证洼地沿河土地耕作
    【新华社沈阳八日电】东北各省大力组织人民治水防泛，以免各地内河泛滥成灾，保证为数巨大的洼地及沿河土地的耕作。东北行政委员会农业部水利总局已陆续派出大批人员至各省勘测河堤，并协助各省水利局有计划地组织人民防泛。松江省除在五常、通河、延寿、海林、尚志、宁安等六个县建立了水利委员会，防护原有的水利工程外，还动员各区农民挖濠筑坝，排水防涝。拉林县为预防境内＠牛河春泛，已于最近加工修筑水利，以保五百余垧（每垧十亩）旱田和三百垧水田不遭灾害。该水利全部完工时，还可扩大水田面积七百垧。辽宁省由国家拨款资助修治之浑河水利工程亦已大部开工，工成可使境内数万垧良田免遭水害，且能恢复水田一万余垧，估计能增产稻米四万吨。该省另有五处较大工程，亦已勘测完毕，定于本月初旬动工。辽北省新民县正修筑横贯境内九十六里的辽河河防，预计需人工三十余万个，争取于最近完成。该堤之修筑，可使沿河三万三千垧良田与三十五个村免受水灾。嫩江省为防止洮儿河中下两游之泛滥，正进行布置修治工作。黑龙江、吉林、合江三省之防止内河春泛工作则早已开始。
