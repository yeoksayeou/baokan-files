　　Ji Pifu and His Culture Village
　　Introduction of Representatives Attending the First National Congress of the Youth League
　　Liang Hang
　　Ji Pifu, one of the representatives of the East China New Democratic Youth League, is from Jingou Guanzhuang Village in Junan County, Shandong Province. He is a poor peasant and is twenty-five years old this year. When he was about to set off to Beijing to attend the meeting, the villagers joyfully saw him off. The elderly people solemnly told him, "Our Jingou Guanzhuang has never had anyone go to Beijing in generations!" Ji Pifu is honored to be a representative of the East China Youth League and to attend the First National Congress of the Youth League in Beijing because he has outstanding work achievements: he transformed Jingou Guanzhuang, a culturally backward village, into a culturally advanced village.

　　In this village of more than 760 people, only one landlord and one rich peasant could write documents and contracts in the past; in addition, there were six people who could recognize three or four hundred characters, but they could only recognize and not write. The peasants in the village suffered too much from illiteracy. Tang Xi borrowed some money to do a small business, selling eggs and wine. When someone came to buy wine on credit, he would draw a large wine pot, and draw a few horizontal lines for every tael they bought. When someone came to buy eggs on credit, he would draw an egg and also draw some lines to calculate the number. But after drawing and drawing, when he opened the paper, he only saw the paper full of eggs and wine pots. Whose debt it was, was completely messed up and impossible to figure out. Ji Pifu himself had also suffered from this kind of hardship. He once helped his elder brother keep track of the accounts for selling pork head meat. Ji Pifu said, "There are more than 180 households in the whole village, asking me to keep these accounts in my mind, where can I even begin to think?" He didn't know how many beatings he had endured because of these worrying things.

　　Ji Pifu was originally a hired laborer. In 1940, after some areas of Ju County were liberated and democratic governments were established, Ji Pifu's life slowly improved. In 1943, when Ji Pifu was nineteen years old, he was a youth work cadre in the village, the captain of the Youth Anti-Japanese Vanguard. He often went to the district to attend meetings and knew the importance of learning culture. Moreover, he had suffered from a lack of culture himself, so he had long wanted to learn. Mu Changqing, the chairman of the village's Youth National Salvation Association, once suddenly took out a broken fountain pen from his pocket. This was the first time it had ever been seen in Jingou Guanzhuang! Old Mu wrote a large "大" (dà - big) character for Ji Pifu to recognize. Learning started from here. Old Mu couldn't recognize many characters either, so the two of them would always learn together whenever they had time. They recognized the characters on the couplets pasted on the door, and looked for characters with few strokes on the proclamations posted by the People's Government.

　　After learning together for more than twenty days, they summarized that they had recognized a total of forty-seven characters. Ji Pifu said unsatisfied, "This won't do! We need to find more young people to learn together. If I forget a new character, you won't forget it. If you forget it, he won't forget it. This is how we can help each other." As they talked, they went to find people separately, each first trying to mobilize one person. After several attempts to mobilize people, a man named Ji Pixiang hesitated and said, "People study in the study, and they still can't learn. We work in the fields, and our hands are like sticks, I'm afraid we can't learn." In the end, they managed to mobilize two people, so there were four of them learning together. The two new participants learned for twelve days and also learned about twenty characters. The few people discussed and felt that it would be more convenient to learn with more people, so they went to mobilize more people to participate in the learning. When they encountered people who were difficult to mobilize, they would ask Ji Pifu to persuade them. There was a man named Wang Zitong, who was very stubborn and always refused to participate in the learning. The last time, he even got angry with the person who was trying to persuade him, saying, "I want to learn or not! Why are you meddling in my business?" From then on, they looked like enemies when they met. But Ji Pifu didn't think it was meddling in his business. He still patiently persuaded him, and used the hardship that Wang Zitong himself suffered from not knowing how to read to persuade Wang Zitong; he also used the learning achievements of the people who had already started recognizing characters to encourage Wang Zitong. After mobilizing him for the seventh time, Wang Zitong was both grateful and ashamed, and finally agreed to learn. He said, "I am a very clumsy person! ... I'll try to learn a few characters!" The number of people participating in learning to recognize characters slowly increased to sixteen. At that time, the landlords and rich peasants in the village scornfully said of these activities, "Poor monkeys, making ghosts."

　　When learning, they needed stationery. They composed a song: "Grass as a pen, the ground as paper, never forget to learn." They wrote with lime, and dipped scraped soot from the pot in grass sticks to write. Later, they even modified two bullet casings into homemade fountain pens, which could be carried on their bodies after they were used up. Ji Pifu helped the people who were learning together make twenty-six homemade fountain pens.

　　Ji Pifu's activities were initially only among young peasants. Later, many young people in the village had organized themselves to study. The following year, 1944, Ji Pifu and his comrades' activities of publicizing and organizing learning shifted to young women. Ji Pifu, with the help of the democratic village government, opened a women's literacy class in the village. At the beginning, there were sixty-two women participating. But some people, although they participated, were not active in learning, and some even skipped classes. When it was time for class, the captain had to shout everywhere. Ji Pifu and the young people who were studying culture together composed a song to criticize the women's literacy class, saying: "Literacy class, a real disgrace, have to be shouted at every time to go to school. Recognize many characters, much more respectable, writing letters and keeping accounts is not difficult. Why don't you do it this way? Where do you call one, hey! Why don't you do it this way?" After the criticism, the women's literacy class made some progress in their learning. Ji Pifu and the others immediately composed a song to praise and encourage the women in the literacy class: "Literacy class, a true model, go to work on time to study, go up to the class until two o'clock, when you get home, you still spin thread, still spin thread." After the praise, the women in the literacy class were very happy and studied very attentively, and also composed a song to answer the young people, saying: "The Youth National Salvation Association, offers opinions, offers more opinions to help us; if there are mistakes, point them out, and work together to move forward."

　　A wave of learning swept the whole village, men and women. Like Mu Kui and his wife! They asked each other questions and learned from each other at home. The table and the edge of the bed were covered with chalk writings. Even the elderly men earnestly studied. An old man of a revolutionary martyr's family, named Wang Zhen, was very moved when he saw the enthusiasm of the young people in the village for learning culture. He said, "I was born too early!" Another old man named Ji Xiang, recalling the cultural backwardness of the village when he was young, was saddened by his youthful ignorance and sighed, "The Eighth Route Army came too late." But Old Man Wang Zhen was not willing to admit that he was old at all. He carried a piece of broken tile with him and asked Ji Pifu and some literate young people to write new characters on the tile and teach him to recognize them. He also had a large wooden board at home, on which he repeatedly practiced.

　　Now, when you go to Jingou Guanzhuang, you can see a very eye-catching feature as soon as you enter the street, that is, all the smooth places on the street are crookedly filled with words; the doors of every household have also become blackboards for learning, filled with words written in white powder, and all have become flowery doors. Today, none of the 197 young people in the village is illiterate, and at least they can recognize two or three hundred characters. People like Ji Pifu are now able to read books and newspapers and write general letters and communications. There are twenty-seven work exchange groups in the village, and each group does not worry about not having anyone to keep accounts. Ji Pifu said that these twenty-seven work exchange groups have never collapsed, and one of the important reasons is that there are more literate people, and the work accounts are clearly recorded one by one. In an ordinary small village, ordering a few newspapers is almost enough for everyone to pass around. But in Jingou Guanzhuang, there are forty-six households subscribing to the Binhai Rural News, and twenty households subscribing to the Binhai Pictorial. In the previous period, in order to cope with the war situation, the newspaper office had to reduce the number of copies issued, and at that time it had to notify the subscribers in Jingou Guanzhuang to reduce the number of subscriptions. In addition, the village also runs five blackboard newspapers to promote all the work in the village. This blackboard newspaper is not just a name. Because there are too many people who can write articles, there are more than 120 people who regularly contribute. A female correspondent named Mu Rong, who is eighteen years old, contributed thirty-two articles to the blackboard newspaper in one month. In order to facilitate learning, the emancipated peasants in the village have bought one hundred and twenty or thirty fountain pens.

　　In just five or six years, Jingou Guanzhuang has been transformed from an ignorant and culturally backward village into a village that has basically eliminated illiteracy. In this regard, Ji Pifu and his young comrades have made contributions. Therefore, on November 25, 1946, Ji Pifu was admitted into the New Democratic Youth League as a member.

　　纪丕福和他的文化村
  　出席青年团第一次全国代表大会代表介绍
    梁行
    华东新民主主义青年团的代表之一纪丕福，是山东莒南县金沟官庄的人。他是一个贫农，今年二十五岁。这次他临动身到北平来开会，村里人欢天喜地地送他上路，上了年纪的人郑重地对他说：“咱金沟官庄，可几辈子也还没一个人上过北京城哪！”纪丕福能够很光荣地作为华东青年团的代表，到北平参加青年团第一次全国代表大会，那是因为他有着光辉的工作成绩：他把一个文化上最落后的金沟官庄，改造成为一个文化上的先进村了。
    这个村七百六十多口人里面，过去只有一个地主和一个富农能写写文书契约；另外有六个人能认得三四百字，但是他们光能认不能写。村里的农民吃不认字的苦头，那就吃得太多了。有个唐喜借了点钱做小生意，卖鸡蛋和酒，别人来赊帐买酒，他就画一个大酒壶，买几两就画几条横道道。有人来赊鸡蛋，他就画个鸡蛋，并且也画上几道道用来计算数目。但是画来画去，打开纸只看见满纸是鸡蛋和酒壶，究竟那一份是谁赊的，都已经完全乱得找不出一个头绪了。这种苦头，纪丕福本人也受过，他曾经帮助他哥哥用脑子记卖猪头肉的帐，纪丕福说：“全庄一百八十多户人家，叫我在心里记着这些帐，那叫我上哪里想去？”就为了这些愁人的事，他不知道挨过了多少顿打。
    纪丕福本来是一个雇工。一九四○年，莒县有一部份地区，在解放了之后，建立了民主政府，纪丕福的生活这才慢慢好起来。一九四三年，就是纪丕福十九岁那一年，他在村子上是一个青年工作干部，是青年抗日先锋队的队长，经常到区里去开会，知道学习文化的重要，更加上自己受过没有文化的苦处，他早就很想学习。村里青年救国会会长穆长清，有一次忽然从身上掏出了一枝破钢笔，这在金沟官庄还是头一回见哩，老穆写了个大小的“大”字，给纪丕福认。学习从这里就开始了。老穆同样也认不了几个字，两人从此一有空就总在一块认字。照门上贴的对联上的字认，照人民政府贴的布告上找笔划少的字认。
    两人一块学了二十几天，总结了一下，一共认了四十七个字。纪丕福不满足地说：“不行呵！咱们得多找几个青年一块学，学个生字我忘了，你忘不了。你忘了，他忘不了。这样互相帮助才行。”两人说着就分头去找人，一人先去动员一个。动员了几次，有个叫纪丕祥的犹豫的说：“人家在书房里学，都还学不成，咱们下地做活，手象棍子似的，怕学不了。”最后好歹动员成功了两个人，这就四个在一块学习。新参加的两个人，学了十二天，也都学会了有二十来个字。几个人一商量，觉得还是人多点学着方便，就又去动员人参加学习，遇到难动员的人，就叫纪丕福去说服。有个王子同，个性很固执，总是不愿意参加学习，最后一次，他还对劝他的人，发了脾气说：“我爱学不学！要你管这个闲事？”从此见了面象仇人似的。但是纪丕福可不认为这是闲事，他还是耐心地劝说，并且就用王子同本人不认得字受的苦处，来劝说王子同；还用已经开始认字的几个人学习的成绩来鼓励王子同。动员到第七次，王子同又感激又渐愧，终于同意学习了，他说：“我这个人很鲁呵！……学几个字试试吧！”参加学习认字的慢慢发展到十六个人了，对于这些活动，村里的地主富农们当时轻视地说：“穷猴子，瞎出鬼。”
    学习起来要用文具。他们编了个歌：“草当笔，地当纸，时时刻刻不忘学习。”他们用石灰写，用刮下的锅墨灰沾在草棍上来写，后来还用两颗子弹壳改装成土造的自来水笔，用完了可以往身上一装带着走。纪丕福帮着一块学习的人做了二十六枝土钢笔。
    纪丕福他们的活动，开头还只是在青年农民中间。后来，村里许多青年人已经组织起来进行学习了。第二年，就是一九四四年，纪丕福他们宣传和组织学习的活动，又转移到青年妇女中间。纪丕福得到民主村政府的帮助，在村里开办了一个妇女识字班。一开头，参加的妇女，就有六十二个。但是有些人虽然参加了，学习并不积极，有的还逃学。到上课的时候，还得队长到处喊。纪丕福和一起学习文化的青年们就编了个歌子批评妇女识字班，说：“识字班，真丢脸，每逢上学要人喊。认字多，多体面，写信记帐不费难。你为什么不这样干？哪叫一呀嘿！你为什么不这样干？”经过批评以后，妇女识字班的学习有了一些进步。纪丕福他们又马上编了一只歌表扬和鼓励识字班的妇女们：“识字班，真模范，按时到学去上班，一上上到下两点，回到家里还纺线，还纺线。”经过表扬，妇女识字班的妇女们都欢喜的很，学习很用心，并且也编了个歌，回答青年们，说：“青救会，提意见，多提意见帮助俺；有错处，多指点，共同努力往前干。”
    全村男男女女学习热潮掀起了。象穆魁和他的妻子吧！在家里互相考问互相学，桌子上、床沿上都写满了粉笔字。甚至，就是上了年纪的老汉也认真学习起来。一位烈属老汉叫王贞的，看到全村青年壮年学习文化的热潮，他很感动地说：“我这是下生早了！”还有一位老汉叫纪相，他回想自己年青时村子里文化落后的情形，他难过自己少年时的愚昧，叹息地说：“八路军来晚了。”但是王贞老汉一点也不服老，随身就带着一块破瓦片片，看到纪丕福和一些识字的青年们，他就叫他们在瓦片上写生字教他认。他家里还有一块大木板，回到家里就在那上面反复的练习。
    现在到金沟官庄去，一进街里就可以看到一个很引人注意的特色，就是大街上凡是平滑的地方，都歪歪斜斜地写满了字；家家户户的大门扇上也都成了学习的黑板，写满了用白粉写的字，统统成了花花的大门了。到今天，全村一百九十七名青年少年，没有一个不认得字的，至少都可以认得二三百字。象纪丕福他们，现在都已经能够读书看报，写一般的信件和通讯。村里有二十七个变工组，每组都不愁没有人记帐。纪丕福讲，这二十七个变工组从来没有垮台，其中有一个很重要的原因，就是因为识字的人多了，一笔一笔的工帐记的清楚。普通一个小村庄里订几份报纸，差不多就够传看的了。但是金沟官庄，订滨海农村报的就有四十六户人家，还有二十户人家订了滨海画报。前一个时期，为了战争情况，报馆不得不减少发行数量，当时曾经不得不通知金沟官庄的订户，请他们减少订阅的份数。另外村子里还办了五块黑板报，推动村子里的一切工作，这黑板报可不是单单有个名目。因为能写稿子的人太多了，经常写稿的就有一百二十多人。有一个十八岁妇女通讯员穆荣，他一个月就给黑板报投过三十二篇稿子。全村翻身农民为了便于学习，买来的自来水钢笔，已经有一百二三十枝。
    只是五六年功夫，金沟官庄就这样由一个愚昧的文化落后的村庄，变成为一个基本上消灭了文盲的村庄。在这方面，纪丕福和他的青年同志们是有功劳的。因此，在一九四六年十一月二十五号，纪丕福被新民主主义青年团吸收作为一个团员。
