　　Celebrating the Liberation of Nanjing and Taiyuan
    Ancient Capital of Beiping in a Frenzy of Jubilation
    [This Newspaper's Dispatch] On April 24th, the people of Beiping saw more clearly the great power of the people, the People's Liberation Army, a million strong, rushed to Nanjing, liberating Nanjing; rushed to Taiyuan; rushed to Jiangyin, liberating Jiangyin... The day after Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu issued the order to advance, Chiang Kai-shek's old nest was liberated by the invincible People's Liberation Army.
    Two and a half months ago, the people of Beiping celebrated their own liberation; now, two and a half months later, they celebrate the liberation of Nanjing, and people recognize its great significance!
    The complete liberation of China is coming soon!
    The China Youth Art Academy Rushes to Assemble Three Floats in One Hour and Takes to the Streets
    The news of the liberation of Nanjing spread throughout the city like lightning, something everyone had hoped for. Students at Tsinghua University received the news during dinner and immediately began to dance, throwing their food bowls into the air. When the news reached the China Youth Art Academy, everyone assembled three floats and dressed as a yangko dance team within an hour. When the news reached the news vendors, in less than an hour, the news vendors in the East City, West City, and Qianmen... were all crowded at the entrances of various newspaper offices, waiting for the extra edition. This newspaper issued two extra editions in a row, and the rotary press accelerated its work, but still could not meet the demands of the news vendors.
    Around four o'clock, the floats of the China Youth Art Academy, carrying the victorious extra editions, started from Wangfujing Street and headed north. At the front of the first vehicle were huge portraits of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu and flags reading "Liberation of Nanjing" and "Liberation of Taiyuan." Victory stirred everyone's hearts, just like the People's Liberation Army's entry ceremony on January 3rd, and like the welcome to Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu on March 25th. People ran out of factories, shops, schools, and homes, some still holding tools, some holding rice bowls, smiling and shouting, chasing after the vehicles, asking for extra editions. Everyone had the same feeling, and the expression was the same - excitement and joy. Three months ago, Beiping was liberated, and now Nanjing is liberated.
    Countless hands stretched out from the trams, three-wheeled rickshaw drivers abandoned their passengers, travelers dropped their luggage, and vendors abandoned their business, all to ask for extra editions.
    The floats moved slowly forward, followed by hundreds and thousands of hands, enthusiastically chasing after them. Among them were three-wheeled rickshaw drivers, auto repair shop workers, students, and policemen, all shouting, "Give me one, give me one, give me one!" When the tram approached the floats, the tram stopped, and countless hands stretched out from the tram carriages, asking for the victorious extra editions. When the floats entered Qianmen Square, in front of the Arrow Tower, they immediately gathered into a sea of people. Everyone cheered "Long live Chairman Mao, Long live Commander-in-Chief Zhu," "Long live the People's Liberation Army!" The Liberation Army March was played. Hundreds and thousands of extra editions fluttered in the wind, people scrambling for them, chasing after them. At this moment, people forgot everything. Tram drivers stopped the trams, three-wheeled rickshaw drivers abandoned their passengers, travelers dropped their luggage, and vendors forgot their business. Some people even scuffled over the extra editions. Some victors, holding the extra editions they had snatched, read and shouted.
    At this time, every person passing by in a military uniform would receive special respect. Comrade Zhang Jiasheng, a soldier of the Qingshui Division who participated in the battle to liberate Nanjing, said to people while reading the extra edition: "They are too good, too glorious!"
    Torches and Yangko Teams Flood the Night Streets
       The floats turned from Zhushikou to Xuanwumen, and were again surrounded by people, thousands of mouths and thousands of hands reaching for the victorious "extra edition." Load carriers danced their carrying poles, scrap collectors threw their small cloth bundles into the air and danced with their hats. Three-wheeled rickshaw drivers stood on their vehicles, and everyone shouted "Long live!" Some people spontaneously started yangko dances in the crowd. In factories, many activities were being carried out intensely. Newly created wall newspapers were posted, and discussion meetings were automatically started. The Pinghan Railway Youth League, which was holding its founding meeting, specially discussed this matter. Everyone resolved to guarantee the completion of the million-ton military transport plan to support the advancing army. At night, major streets held torch parades. The North China Art Troupe, with seventy or eighty people in a large yangko team, carrying torches, started from Donghuamen Street, passed through Wangfujing, Dongdan, Dengshikou... More than five hundred students, professors and staff members staying at Yenching University also paraded in Haidian, west of the city, to celebrate. When the North China Art Troupe appeared on the street, it attracted thousands upon thousands of people, and the shouts shook the sky. The torchlight reddened everyone's face, and everyone sang and laughed together. When the yangko team sang "Where is Chiang Kai-shek running to? He can't escape to the ends of the earth..." thunderous applause suddenly erupted. Forty or fifty empty three-wheeled vehicles formed several columns and followed closely, and everyone spontaneously sang a heroic song.
    Late at night, the yangko team and countless crowds were still drumming and walking happily in the streets.

　　庆祝南京太原解放
    古都北平一片狂欢声
    【本报讯】四月二十四日，北平人更清楚地看见了人民的伟大力量，人民解放军百万雄师，奔向南京，解放了南京；奔向太原；奔向江阴解放了江阴……在毛主席、朱总司令的进军命令发出后第二天，将介石的老巢，就被无敌的解放军解放了。
    两个半月以前，北平人民庆祝自己的解放；两个半月以后的现在，又来庆祝解放南京，人们都认识它的伟大意义！
    全中国彻底解放即将到来了！
    中国青年艺术学院一小时札起三辆彩车，开上街头
    解放南京的消息象闪电似的传遍了全市，这是每个人所希望着的。清华大学的学生在吃饭时候得到了这个消息，立刻舞动起来，把菜盆也抛向空中。消息传到中国青年艺术学院，一小时内，大家札起三辆彩车，化装了一个秧歌队。消息传到报贩耳中，不到一小时，东城、西城和前门……的报贩，都挤在各报馆门口等着号外。本报连发了两次号外，轮转机加速工作，还是不能应付报贩的要求。
    四时左右，中国青年艺术学院的彩车载着胜利的号外从王府井大街向北开动发了。最前面的一辆车上，竖着毛主席、朱总司令的巨像和“南京解放”“太原解放”的旗帜。胜利激动了每个人的心，像一月三日人民解放军举行入城式一样，象三月二十五日欢迎毛主席、朱总司令一样。人们从工厂里、商店里、学校里、家庭里跑出来，有的还拿着工具，有的拿着饭碗，笑着，叫着追赶汽车，索要号外，心情只是一个，表情也只是一个——兴奋愉快，前三个月解放了北平，现在解放南京了。
    电车里伸出无数双手，三辆车放下了乘客，旅客丢下了行李，商贩
    放下了买卖，都来索取号外。
    彩车缓缓前进，后面扬直千百只手，热情地追随着。这里边有三辆夫的，有修车铺工人的，有学生的，有警察的，大家你嚷我叫：“给我一张，给我一张，给我一张！”电车和彩车靠近时，电车停止了，从电车厢子伸出无数只手，索取着胜利的号外。彩车进到前门广场上，箭楼前，立刻汇成一片人海。大家尽情欢呼“毛主席万岁，朱总司令万岁”“解放军万岁”奏起解放军进行曲。千百张号外随风飘扬，人们争夺着，追逐着，这时人们把一切忘了，开电车的停了电车，三辆车夫放下乘客，旅客丢下了行李，商贩忘了作买卖，还有人因为号外，甚至扭作一团。有些胜利者拿着自已抢到的号外，边看边喊。
      这时，每个过路的穿军衣的人，都会受到特别的尊敬，部队的同志，念着号外，十分羡慕参加解放南京作战的战友擎卫师的战士张家声对人说：他们太好了太光荣了！
    火炬和秧歌队涌上夜的街头
       彩车从珠市口折向宣武门，又被人包围起来，千百张嘴千百双手，朝着胜利的“号外”。挑担的舞着扁担、卖破烂的小骨包袱抛向空一近舞着帽子，三辆车夫蹬着在车上，大家一直高喊：“万岁”有些人自动在人群中扭起了秧歌舞。因工厂里，许多活动在紧张的进行着，赶制的壁报贴出来，座谈会自动开起来发，正在开会的平汉有青年团成立大会，特别讨论了这件事情，大家决议，保证完成百万吨军输计划，，支援前进大军。入夜，各主要街道举行发火炬游行，华北文工团七八十人，的大秧歌队，执着火炬，从东华门大街出发穿过王府井、东单、灯市口……燕京大学留校的五百余学生、教授和工作人员，也在城西海淀游行庆祝。当华北大文工团在街上出现时，吸引着上千上万的人，呼声震天。火光照红发每个人的脸，大家一起高歌，一起欢笑．当着秧歌队唱到“蒋介石往那里跑，天涯海角也跑不了……”的时候，突然爆发了雷鸣似的掌声。四、五十辆空三轮车排成几列纵队紧紧的跟随着，大家不约而同起了雄壮的歌曲。
    夜深了，秧歌队和无数的人群还敲着罗鼓，在街上兴高采烈地走着。
