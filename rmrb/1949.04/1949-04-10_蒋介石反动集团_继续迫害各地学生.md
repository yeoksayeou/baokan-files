　　Many reports indicate that the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary clique continues to persecute students in Nanjing and other places.
　　1. According to Agence France-Presse, Nanjing, April 7th: Nanjing students told the press that they are still under the threat of massacre. They insisted that the Nanjing reactionary government must guarantee their safety and that events similar to the "April 1st" massacre must not happen again; and demanded an investigation to find out who was truly responsible and severely punish them. Another report, according to Reuters, Nanjing, April 4th: Four days after the massacre, Kuomintang military police and secret agents were still stationed around Central University and the National Academy of Drama, threatening to shoot any student who dared to go out.
　　2. Chen Cheng, the puppet chairman of Taiwan Province and war criminal, sent a large number of military police and secret agents on the 6th to surround National Taiwan University and Taiwan Provincial Normal College, searching for and arresting students, and forcing the Normal College to suspend classes, with all students required to re-register. At the same time, he threatened students in secondary and higher education with "expulsion" and "effective sanctions" if they went on strike or demonstrated.
　　3. The Kuomintang reactionary governments in Wuhan, Fuzhou, Chengdu and other places have all issued martial law orders prohibiting student parades and demonstrations.

    二、台湾省伪主席战犯陈诚六日派大批军警特务包围台湾大学和台湾省立师范学院，搜捕学生，并迫令师范学院停课，所有学生一律重新登记。同时以“开除学籍”和“有效制裁”威胁各中等以上学校学生不得罢课游行。
    三、武汉、福州、成都等地国民党反动政府，都曾下令戒严，禁止学生游行和示威。
