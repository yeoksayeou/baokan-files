Xinhua News Agency, North China, 13th. Our reporter interviewed Yunze, Chairman of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Government, who recently arrived in Beiping, and learned about the current situation in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. He said: The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region now has a population of more than 11 million. The six leagues under the jurisdiction of Eastern Mongolia, namely, Jirem, Josutu, Juu Uda, Hinggan, Nawen Murren, and Hulunbuir, have been completely liberated. The six leagues under the jurisdiction of Western Mongolia, namely, Xilingol, Chahar, Ih Juu, Bayannuur, Ulanqab, and Ningxia Mongol, have also been largely liberated. Since the beginning of the People's Liberation War, under the leadership of the Inner Mongolia Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Government, the people of Inner Mongolia have supported the war on the one hand and carried out various new democratic construction tasks on the other. In the past two years, great achievements have been made in military, political, economic, and cultural construction. The armed forces of the Inner Mongolian people—the Inner Mongolian People's Liberation Army—have grown into a powerful force with three columns in combat. This Inner Mongolian people's iron cavalry, fighting side by side with the Northeast and North China People's Liberation Army, has thoroughly shattered the Kuomintang reactionaries' attack on the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and eliminated bandits. In Hinggan League alone, more than 5,000 bandit rifles were seized, and the banditry that had plagued Inner Mongolia for many years has now been eliminated. The Inner Mongolia Autonomous Government was established on May 1, 1947. Since then, it has actively carried out the construction of democratic power in various leagues and banners. Now, people's governments have been generally established in the autonomous region. In the construction of political power, the interests of the Mongol and Han peoples in the autonomous region have been fully taken into account. In pastoral areas, the head of the banner government is generally a Mongolian; in banner governments in agricultural and pastoral areas, there are heads and deputy heads of the banner. In banners with more Mongolians and fewer Hans, Mongolians are generally appointed as the head of the banner and Hans as the deputy head of the banner. In banners with more Hans and fewer Mongolians, Hans are generally appointed as the head of the banner and Mongolians as the deputy head of the banner. The working people of Inner Mongolia have organized various mass organizations. The Inner Mongolia Communist Youth League now has more than 8,000 members. After the Inner Mongolia Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party put forward the slogan of "Mongol and Han peoples are closely united and develop together," the relationship between the Mongol and Han nationalities is extremely harmonious. Land reform has been implemented in agricultural areas, and both Mongol and Han peoples have been allocated land, and their enthusiasm for production has been unprecedentedly enhanced. Under the education of the autonomous government, the agricultural production technology of the Mongolians has greatly improved. For example, in the past, Mongolians never used manure when farming, but last year, 20% of the Mongolians engaged in agricultural production used manure, thus improving the level of agricultural production. In pastoral areas, livestock have increased due to the implementation of the policy of free grazing and protecting and breeding livestock. The lives of the Mongol and Han peoples have now been preliminarily improved. Universal education has now been implemented throughout the region, and there is a primary school in every large administrative village. There are six middle schools in the entire autonomous region, with approximately 2,000 students. In addition, there is the Inner Mongolia Military and Political University and a cadre school for training senior cadres, with approximately 1,000 students. Since the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Inner Mongolia Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Government have trained more than 10,000 cadres and intellectuals. The news media in the autonomous region are also developing. In Ulanhot City (i.e., Wangye Temple), where the autonomous government is located, there is the Inner Mongolia Daily in Mongolian and Chinese versions, with a daily circulation of approximately 4,000 copies.

    【新华社华北十三日电】记者访问了最近到达北平的内蒙古自治政府云泽主席，承告以内蒙自治区的现况。他说：内蒙自治区现拥有一千一百余万人口。东蒙所辖的哲里木、卓索图、昭乌达、兴安、纳文慕仁、呼伦贝尔六个盟已全部解放，西蒙所辖的锡林格勒、察哈尔、伊克昭、巴彦塔拉、乌兰察布、宁夏蒙古六个盟亦已大部解放。自人民解放战争开始以来，内蒙古人民在中国共产党内蒙古党委会和内蒙古自治政府的领导下，一方面支援战争，一方面进行新民主主义的各种建设工作，两年多以来，在军事、政治、经济、文化建设方面均获得了很大的成绩。内蒙古人民的武装——内蒙古人民解放军现已在战斗中壮大成为一支拥有三个纵队的强大队伍。这一支内蒙古人民的铁骑，与东北、华北解放军并肩作战，彻底粉碎了国民党反动派对内蒙自治区的进攻，肃清了土匪，仅在兴安盟，即收缴土匪枪支五千余枝，内蒙多年来的匪患现已消除。内蒙古人民自治政府是于一九四七年五月一日成立的，此后，即积极进行各盟、旗的民主政权的建设工作。现在，在自治区内已普遍建立了人民政府。在建政工作中，充分照顾了自治区内蒙、汉两族人民的利益。游牧区内，旗政府的旗长一般多由蒙人担任；在农牧区内的旗政府则设正副旗长，在蒙民较多汉民较少的旗，多由蒙民任旗长，汉人任副旗长，在汉人较多蒙人较少的旗则多由汉人任旗长，蒙人任副旗长。内蒙劳动人民已组织了各种群众团体。内蒙古青年团现拥有团员八千余人。中国共产党内蒙党委会提出了“蒙汉人民亲密团结、共同发展”的口号后，蒙汉民族间的关系异常融洽。土地改革已在农业区实行了，蒙汉两族人民都分得了土地，生产情绪空前提高。在自治政府的教育下，蒙民的农业生产技术已有了很大的进步。如过去蒙民种地从不上粪，去年上粪的已占从事农业生产的蒙民的百分之二十，因而提高了农业生产的水平。在游牧区内，由于实施了自由放牧、保护与繁殖牲畜的政策，牲畜已有增加。蒙汉人民的生活现已得到了初步改善。全区现已实施了普及教育，在每一较大的行政村都有一所小学。整个自治区内有六个中学校，学生约有二千人。此外尚有内蒙古军政大学和一个培养高级干部的干部学校，学生约有一千余人。从抗战胜利以来，中国共产党内蒙古党委会和内蒙古自治政府已培养了一万多名的干部和知识分子，自治区内的新闻事业亦正在发展。在自治政府所在地的乌兰浩特市（即王爷庙），有蒙文版和汉文版的内蒙古日报，日销约四千份。
