    [This Newspaper reported] The Savings Department of the People's Bank of China's Beiping Branch officially opened yesterday (the 1st). Throughout the day, there was a continuous stream of people conducting pegged-to-value savings transactions. Due to the enthusiastic response from depositors, the bank's operations were quite busy. According to statistics gathered last night, a total of 5,299 standard physical units of various savings deposits were received throughout the day, equivalent to 490,687.4 yuan in People's Currency. Civil servants accounted for the largest proportion of depositors, numbering twenty-four, followed by teachers and students, totaling fourteen.

To facilitate depositors, the department is also actively preparing to establish branch offices, with plans to set up one office in each of the eastern, western, southern, and northern districts of the city.
