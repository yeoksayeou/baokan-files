　　Railway Ministry Party Committee Decides
  　Dismiss Lan Zi'an from His Post
    [This Dispatch] After our newspaper published the editorial and news on the 9th regarding Comrade Lan Zi'an, Director of the Zhangjiakou Railway Sub-bureau, displaying serious right-leaning ideology and bureaucracy, the Party Committee and administrative leadership of the Military Commission's Railway Ministry immediately issued a ministry order on the same day, designating the Pingjin Bureau to thoroughly investigate and review the matter within a week and report back for handling. In order to alleviate the concerns of the Zhangjiakou workers so they can boldly express their opinions, to make Comrade Lan Zi'an seriously face his mistakes, and to correct the phenomenon of detachment from the working masses and forgetfulness of our roots within the railway system at all levels, the Railway Ministry Party Committee has decided to immediately give Comrade Lan Zi'an the punishment of dismissal from his post, and publicly announce it to all employees. After all materials and employee opinions are collected and compiled, further handling will be determined based on the extent of Comrade Lan Zi'an's self-criticism. Furthermore, because the mistakes committed by Comrade Lan Zi'an did not only occur in one place, it was decided that the Party Committees at all levels under the Railway Ministry should mobilize all employees to study this editorial, conduct extensive and in-depth discussions; examine the leading organs and responsible persons, Party members at all levels on the points pointed out in the editorial, and connect with self-examination. A special report summarizing this work should be submitted to the Railway Ministry Party Committee by the end of May.

　　铁道部党委会决定
  　撤销兰子安职务
    【本报讯】本报九日发表张家口铁路分局长兰子安同志严重右倾思想、官僚主义的社论与消息后，军委铁道部党委会与行政领导上即于同日以部令指定平津局，以一周时间迅速澈查检讨此事具报，俾便处理外，为了使张家口工人去掉顾虑，能大胆的发表意见，为了使兰子安同志严重的正视自己的错误，为了纠正铁道系统各级机构内脱离工人群众的现象与忘本思想，铁道部党委会决定立即给兰子安同志撤职处分，并向全体员工公开宣布：俟全部材料与员工意见搜集汇齐后，参照兰子安同志自我检讨的程度，再作进一步的处理。又因兰子安同志所犯的错误不止在一个地方发生，决定铁道部所属各级党委会领导发动全体员工学习这一日社论，广泛深入讨论；在社论指出的各点上，检查各级领导机关与各级负责人、党员并联系检查自己，限于五月底总结这一工作向铁道部党委会作专门报告。
