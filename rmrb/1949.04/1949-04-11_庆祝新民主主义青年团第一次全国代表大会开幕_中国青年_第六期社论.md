Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 10th: "China Youth" Issue 6 editorial, titled: "Celebrating the Opening of the First National Congress of the New Democratic Youth League" reads as follows:

　　The First National Congress of the New Democratic Youth League of China will be held in Beiping on April 11th, and the New Democratic Youth League will be formally established. This is an epoch-making event in the history of the Chinese youth movement, worthy of cheers from this generation of young people. Since October 1946, when the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China proposed to re-establish the Youth League, after two and a half years of trial operation, the Youth League has been established in vast areas. For example, the factory Youth Leagues and school Youth Leagues in some cities in the Northeast, and some rural Youth Leagues in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, have a fairly solid foundation. In the past two and a half years, especially after the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China issued the resolution on establishing the League in January this year, many advanced young people in factories, rural areas, and schools have rushed to join the Youth League, and have worked harder in production and study after joining the League, feeling honored to be a member of the Youth League. The newly growing New Democratic Youth League has become a fighting banner supported by all revolutionary youth.

　　The Chinese youth movement has a heroic revolutionary tradition for thirty years and has accumulated many valuable experiences. This conference must summarize and develop these experiences in order to determine the direction and tasks of the Youth League, formulate the work program of the Youth League, and adopt the official charter of the Youth League.

　　Regarding the work of the Youth League, we would like to offer a few simple suggestions on the occasion of the opening of the First National Congress of the Youth League:

　　First, regarding the nature of the Youth League. According to the experience of the past thirty years, to organize and educate the younger generation, we must start by uniting and organizing advanced young activists, and then unite and educate the broad masses of young people through the organization of these activists. Only by organizing the advanced elements among the advanced youth can the broad masses of young people have a core. The Communist Youth League during the Great Revolution and the Land Revolution, the National Liberation Vanguard during the December 9th Movement and the early stage of the Anti-Japanese War, the Wuhan Youth National Salvation Corps, the Guangdong Youth Anti-Japanese Vanguard, the Northeast Democratic Youth League and the New Democratic Youth League in the Kuomintang-controlled areas during the Liberation War, all demonstrated this point with their vigorous atmosphere in their work. Without the organization of activists as the backbone, directly organizing the broad, scattered youth, including the progressive, intermediate, and backward elements, and trying to make everyone act in the same way, the result is often unsustainable and eventually becomes formalism, with no one being able to move. The Youth National Salvation Association during the Anti-Japanese War played a very active role in the Anti-Japanese War at the beginning, but eventually became lax and powerless in the later stage of the Anti-Japanese War due to the lack of organization and promotion by advanced youth. This point should be noted. At the same time, we must prevent the youth organization from becoming a narrow organization, like the Communist Youth League in the later period of the Land Revolution, which would lose its role of educating the broad youth and training a broad reserve force for the Party. Therefore, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China pointed out in this resolution on establishing the League: the New Democratic Youth League is a mass organization of advanced youth under the political leadership of the Communist Party of China, resolutely fighting for New Democracy.

　　Second, regarding the status of the youth movement in the people's revolutionary movement. Our youth movement is originally a part of the people's revolutionary movement. The Youth League should call on and organize young people to participate in the New Democratic cause and serve the people. However, young people themselves have some "special demands and special interests." For example, issues related to treatment, learning, and marriage must be taken care of. On this issue, on the one hand, we should not, like in a few areas during the mid-stage of the Anti-Japanese War, overly emphasize the special interests of young people in rural areas where the family is the unit of production, even mobilizing young people to organize their own youth farms, so as to unnecessarily oppose the family and hinder the overall interests of the people, thus making the youth work itself unable to develop. At the same time, on the other hand, we should not, like the other deviation that occurred in some areas of the Liberated Areas after 1942, quite ignore the special demands and special interests of young people, ignore the learning problems of young people, and thus fail to fully exert the due enthusiasm of young people, making the entire revolutionary work lack a powerful assistant and reserve force. We believe that we must combine the overall interests of the people with the special interests of young people, strive to serve the special interests of young people on the basis of the overall interests of the people, and gradually guide the broad masses of young people to participate in the New Democratic revolutionary cause in this effort.

　　Third, regarding the tasks of the Youth League. As mentioned above, the tasks of the Youth League should be subordinate to the overall tasks of the Chinese people's revolutionary movement. The old China is about to perish. We must not only know how to eliminate the remaining Kuomintang reactionary forces, but also restore and develop production, and engage in the construction of a New Democratic country. We must see the bright and brilliant future of China. The future of the new China will be borne by this generation of young people. This is the highest task that the current Chinese people's revolutionary movement has given to the youth movement. Therefore, young people must establish a Marxist-Leninist worldview, learn Marxist-Leninist thinking methods, learn the unity of Marxism-Leninism and the practice of the Chinese revolution, and learn the full set of skills to build a new China. Therefore, the basic task of the Youth League should be learning and cultivating the younger generation. The Youth League should educate itself and the broad masses of young people, not only to learn how to defeat imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism from theory and practical struggles, but also to learn how to engage in the construction of modern industry and agriculture to build a new China.

　　Fourth, regarding the scope of the Youth League's work. Since the Youth League is learning to cultivate the younger generation, it is to educate young people to learn Marxism-Leninism, and to learn the full set of skills for combat and production, so as to continuously transport them to various work positions and become the pillars of building a new China; since the youth movement itself is a part of the people's revolutionary movement, it is to serve the interests of the masses of young people on the basis of the overall interests of the people; therefore, the scope of the Youth League's work and study cannot be very broad, so that everyone can be exercised in all aspects and learn things. The work of the Youth League itself should not be limited to developing members, holding branch meetings, studying the history and organizational forms of the youth movement... within this narrow scope. It must allocate its cadres and members to participate in various construction works, learn in various works, and study the experiences and lessons learned from the study, so that it can slowly become a skilled worker as it grows older. The cadres and members of the Youth League at all levels should learn to organize production, participate in wars, learn to manage politics, run schools, run newspapers, manage factories, and learn science and technology and production technology in participating in various works. Everyone should become a specialized talent, instead of being a mere talker. In this way, can it undertake the role of cultivating talents and transporting cadres.

　　This Youth League Congress will definitely have detailed discussions on these issues. The New Democratic Youth League of China will be formally established in this conference, and the Central Committee of the Youth League will be elected. It is believed that under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the Youth League will inherit and carry forward the glorious tradition of the Chinese youth movement for thirty years, become the core of uniting and educating the broad masses of young people, lead the broad masses of young people to participate in the construction of a new China, and strive for the complete liberation of all China and all mankind. We hereby wish the conference a successful victory!

　　庆祝新民主主义青年团第一次全国代表大会开幕
    ——“中国青年”第六期社论
    【新华社北平十日电】“中国青年”第六期社论：题：“庆祝新民主主义青年团第一次全国代表大会开幕”文如下：
    中国新民主主义青年团第一次全国代表大会四月十一日在北平举行，新民主主义青年团就要正式成立。这是中国青年运动史上划时代的大事，值得这一代的青年们举手欢呼的。自从一九四六年十月，中共中央提议从新建立青年团以来，经过两年半的试办，在广大地区都已建立起青年团。例如东北的一些城市中的工厂青年团，学校青年团，陕甘宁边区的一些农村青年团，已具有相当坚实的基础。两年半以来，特别是在今年一月中共中央发出建团决议以后，许多工厂农村学校的先进青年们争先恐后地涌入青年团，在入团之后更加努力工作，生产与学习，为加入青年团而感到光荣。刚刚生长起来的新民主主义青年团，已经成为一切革命青年所拥护的战斗旗帜。
    三十年来中国的青年运动，具有英雄的革命传统，积累了许多宝贵的经验，这次大会，一定要将这些经验加以总结与发挥，借以确定青年团的方针与任务，制定青年团的工作纲领，通过青年团的正式团章。
    关于青年团的工作，我们愿乘青年团第一次全国代表大会开幕之际，简单的提供几点意见：
    第一、关于青年团的性质问题。根据三十年来的经验，要组织与教育青年一代，必须从团结与组织先进青年积极分子着手，再经过这种积极分子的组织，去团结和教育广大青年群众。只有很好的组织先进青年中的先进分子，才能使广大青年群众有一个核心。大革命与土地革命时期的共产主义青年团，一二九时代与抗日战争初期的民族解放先锋队，武汉青年救国团，广东青年抗日先锋队，解放战争中东北的民主青年联盟及国民党统治区的新民主主义青年联盟等，它们在工作中的那种蓬蓬勃勃的气象，都说明了这一点。若没有积极分子的组织作为骨干，而直接组织广大的、散漫的、包括前进部分、中间部分与落后部分的青年，想使大家同样地动作起来，其结果往往不能持久，最后流为形式主义，大家都动不起来。抗日战争时期的青年救国会，在开始时候对于抗日战争曾起了很大的积极作用，但终于因为缺少先进青年的组织推动，在抗日战争后期，便显得松懈无力了，这一点是应该注意的。但同时，又要防止将青年团体变为狭隘的组织，象土地革命后期的共产主义青年团那样，那就失去了为党教育广大的青年、训练广大的后备军的作用。因此，在这次中共中央建团决议上就指出：新民主主义青年团是在中国共产党的政治领导下坚决地为新民主主义而斗争的先进青年的群众性的组织。
    第二、关于青年运动在人民革命运动中的地位问题。我们的青年运动本来是人民革命运动的一部分。青年团就要号召与组织青年参加新民主主义事业，为人民大众服务。但是青年本身有一些“特殊要求与特殊利益”。例如关于待遇问题、学习问题、婚姻问题等，是必须照顾的。在这个问题上，一方面不应该象抗日战争中期少数地区一样，在以家庭为生产单位的农村中，过于强调青年的特殊利益，甚至动员青年们自己组织了青年农场，以致不必要地与家庭对立，妨碍了人民群众的总的利益，因而使青年工作本身也不能开展。同时，在另一方面，也不应该象一九四二年以后，解放区有些地区青年工作中所发生的另一偏向，就是相当忽视了青年本身的特殊要求与特殊利益，忽视青年的学习问题，因而不能充分发挥青年应有的积极性，使整个革命工作中缺少一个有力的助手和后备军。我们认为必须把人民群众的总的利益和青年的特殊利益结合起来，在人民群众的总的利益的基础上努力为青年群众的特殊利益服务，并在这种努力中有步骤地引导广大青年群众参加新民主主义革命事业。
    第三、关于青年团的任务问题。如上所说，青年团的任务，应该服从中国人民革命运动的总任务。旧中国就快要灭亡了，我们不但要知道肃清残余的国民党反动力量，而且要恢复与发展生产，从事新民主主义国家的建设，要看到中国光辉灿烂的将来。新中国的将来，就要这一代的青年来担承了。这是当前中国人民革命运动所赋予青年运动的最高任务。因此，青年们必须建立马列主义的人生观，学习马列主义思想方法，学习马列主义与中国革命实践之统一的思想，并学会建设新中国的全副本领。因此，青年团的基本任务就应该是学习，培养青年一代。青年团要教育自己和广大青年从理论上，从实际斗争中，不仅学会如何战胜帝国主义封建主义和官僚资本主义，并且要学会如何从事现代化的工业和农业的建设，来建设新中国。
    第四、关于青年团工作的范围问题。青年团既然是培养青年一代的学习，是要教育青年们学会马列主义，学会战斗与生产的全副本领，以便不断输送到各种工作岗位上去，成为建设新中国的栋梁；青年运动本身既是人民革命运动的一部分，是要在人民大众总的利益基础上为青年群众的利益服务；因此，青年团的工作与学习的范围就不能不是很广泛的，以便使大家在各方面得到锻炼，学到东西。青年团本身的工作就不能仅仅局限于发展团员，开支部会，研究青运历史与组织形式………这一狭隘的范围之内。必须分配自己的干部和团员参与各方面的建设工作，在各项工作中学习，并且研究学习的心得与经验，使自己随着年龄的增长而慢慢成为熟练的工作者。青年团的各级干部与团员，应该在参加各方面的工作中学会组织生产、参加战争，学会管理政治、办学校、办报纸、管理工厂、学会科学技术、生产技术，各人都应该成为具有专门的人才，而不是只会夸夸其谈的清谈家。这样，才能担负起培养人才输送干部的作用。
    这次青年团代表大会开幕，对于这些问题，一定会有详尽的讨论。在这次大会中将正式成立中国新民主主义青年团，并选出青年团的中央委员会，相信青年团将在中国共产党的领导之下，继承与发扬三十年来中国青年运动的光荣传统，成为团结与教育广大青年的核心，领导广大青年参加建设新中国，为全中国全人类的彻底解放事业而奋斗，我们在这里敬祝大会的胜利成功！
