　　Ehrenburg – Ilya Ehrenburg, the world's most prestigious journalist and famous Soviet writer, was born in 1891 in the family of a manufacturer in Moscow. He participated in revolutionary activities at the age of fifteen, was arrested and imprisoned for more than a year, and fled to France at the age of eighteen and began writing poetry. In 1917, he returned to his homeland to participate in the February Revolution, and in 1921 he went to Paris again. After his momentarily successful "Julio Jurenito" was published, he wrote more than fifty works in succession. During World War II, he first wrote the immortal masterpiece "The Fall of Paris," which won the Stalin Literary Prize. After Hitler invaded the Soviet Union, he returned to China as a journalist and columnist for "Red Star", and was awarded the Lenin Medal for his meritorious service. After the war, he traveled to Europe and the United States, writing many travelogues praising the light of the new society and exposing the corruption of the old world, and completed another masterpiece, "The Storm," winning the Stalin Literary Prize for the second time.

　　Taylor – Born in Oregon, USA in 1904, he worked as a cowboy on a small farm, dropped out of school at the age of twelve, and began to make a living by acting. Since 1937, he has participated in congressional elections, but he failed in three elections. It was not until 1944 that he defeated his opponent, the isolationist Clark, and was elected as a senator from Idaho. In the Senate, he opposed the passage of anti-labor bills (Taft-Hartley Act), accused the Democratic and Republican parties of being completely controlled by monopoly capitalists, vehemently opposed the Truman Doctrine and the Marshall Plan, and spoke out for blacks who were racially discriminated against. In February 1948, he announced his withdrawal from the Democratic Party, and in November of the same year, he was nominated as the Progressive Party's vice presidential candidate in the US presidential election.
