Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 7th: Free Greece Radio broadcast: The new and powerful offensive launched by the Greek Democratic Army in the Grammos Mountains earlier this month is now proceeding according to the original plan. The enemy forces have been surrounded, and all attempts to break out have failed and are being annihilated. The enemy's forces and equipment have suffered heavy losses. This offensive by the Democratic Army has caused panic and disorder within the royalist fascists. Greatly alarmed by the fate of the large royalist fascist force that has been surrounded and cut off, the Athens headquarters has ordered the immediate replacement of the commander of the First Army Corps operating in the Grammos region.
