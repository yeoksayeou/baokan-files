　　Preventing Drought to Ensure Planting
　　Jiahe Launches Well-Digging Campaign

　　[Hebei Central News] In order to prevent drought and ensure timely planting, Jiahe County has mobilized the masses to dig wells extensively. The farmers in this county have traditionally not had the habit of digging wells, and they have concerns: brick wells are too expensive, earthen wells don't last long, the bottom is sandy and unstable, and the water quality is poor, etc. After leadership and mobilization by cadres at all levels, preliminary results have been achieved in the past half month. According to statistics from 87 villages, 12 new brick wells have been dug, 34 old brick wells have been repaired, and 336 earthen wells have been dug. The villages are continuing to carry out well-digging. The following experiences have been gained: (1) Rely on the leadership of the Party to motivate ordinary farmers. In Sanlizhuang Village, First District, when well-digging was mentioned, the farmers all thought it was impossible. After repeated discussions at the branch party member meeting, party member Guo Shaoxian organized four households and dug an earthen well in two days. Under his propaganda and influence, three more groups were formed, a total of twelve people, who dug three earthen wells. (2) Hold forums with experienced farmers to study planting experience, inspire the masses to plant early, and mobilize the masses to dig wells and carry water for planting. When the Sizihe Village branch held a forum with experienced farmers, they started with sayings like "Little Fullness flowers don't return home" and "Peanuts planted late don't mature" (meaning peanut beans are not plump), fostering the idea of ​​early planting. After such mobilization, two earthen wells have been dug. Zhang Molong from Duanzhuang Village digs earthen wells every year, planting melons and watering other crops, and his harvests are better than most. This year he promoted: "I dig earthen wells every year, it's not difficult. I water my land when it's dry, and my crops are always better than others!" The farmers believed his true words and started digging wells. The village has now dug 25 earthen wells. (3) Guide farmers to engage in debate themselves, dispelling their concerns that there will be no good water and that the wells will not last long. When Renlao Village mentioned digging wells, some people raised the issue "All alkaline water, can't be used to water the land!" However, others said: "One mu has three springs, the water is different." After debate, the masses' ideological concerns were dispelled.

　　[Hebei East News] During the Kuomintang rule, the water and irrigation ditches of Xiaojie Village, Tong County, were blocked from allowing farmers to introduce canal water into the moat, citing city defense reasons. After liberation, with the support of the North China Cotton Improvement Office, led by farmers Wang Yushu and Hong Yuyuan, the masses were organized, with the help of the local People's Liberation Army, and the ditches, engine rooms, and riverbanks were completely repaired within ten days. The Cotton Improvement Office also borrowed electric engines, water pumps, etc., which were equipped in two days and completed on the 22nd of this month, capable of irrigating 1,100 mu of land. Local farmers have escaped the threat of spring drought and are actively planting cotton.

　　防备天旱保证播种
  　交河发动打井
    【冀中讯】为了防旱及保证按时播种，交河发动群众普遍打井。该县农民，向来没有打井习惯，他们顾虑着：砖井打不起，土井使不长，底下有沙站不稳，水不好等等，经过各级干部的领导发动，半个月来，已获初步成绩。据八十七个村的统计，已经打好新砖井十二眼，修好旧砖井三十四眼，挖了土井三百三十六眼。现各村还在继续开展打井。并获得了以下几点经验：（一）依靠党的领导，带动一般农民。一区三里庄村，一提打井，农民都认为不可能，经过支部党员会上反复讨论，党员郭绍先组织了四户，两天挖成了一个土井。在他的宣传影响下，又组成了三组，共十二个人，打成了三个土井。（二）召开老农座谈会研究播种经验，启发群众早种要求，发动群众打井和挑水点种。四合村支部，召开老农座谈会时，从“小满的花不回家”、“花生晚了不实成”（花生豆不饱满的意思）等说起，酝酿早种，经过这样发动，已打好了两眼土井。段庄村张墨龙，每年打土井，也种瓜也浇别的庄稼，收成比一般的都好。今年他向人宣传说：“我年年打土井，这活并不难。我的地天旱了就浇，哪年的庄稼不比别人强？”农民听信了他的真实话，也就动手打开井了。现该村已挖好了土井二十五眼。（三）诱导农民自己展开辩论，打破他们怕没有好水和不能长期使用的顾虑。任老村提起打井就有人提出“净碱水，不能浇地！”可是另外也有人说：“一亩三泉，水不一样。”经过辩论，打消了群众的思想顾虑。
    【冀东讯】通县小街村的水和灌溉沟，在国民党统治时，借口城防不准农民将运河水经护城河引入水渠。解放后，在华北棉产改进处扶植下，由农民王玉书、洪玉元领导，组织群众，加上当地解放军的帮助，水沟、机房、河岸于十日内完全修复。又由棉产改进处借到电力发动机、扬水机等，经二日装备，本月二十二日完工，可浇地一千一百亩。当地农民已摆脱春旱威胁，正积极播种棉花。    （民）
