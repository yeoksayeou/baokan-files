　　Celebrating the Liberation of Nanjing (I)
    Good news has arrived! The People's Liberation Army, having crossed the Yangtze River and proven invincible, has liberated Nanjing, the Kuomintang's counter-revolutionary center for the past twenty-two years. In three days of fighting, it has also liberated many famous cities and key towns along the Yangtze River, from Wuxi in the east to Anqing in the west. The People's Liberation Army is now advancing south, sweeping away the remaining enemy forces. Simultaneously, on the Taiyuan front, the People's Liberation Army liberated Taiyuan, the capital of Shanxi Province, in three days of fighting. We extend our highest respect to the brave soldiers of the People's Liberation Army on all fronts. We extend our condolences to our compatriots in southern Jiangsu and Taiyuan who have been liberated from their hellish lives. Since January of this year, the Kuomintang has been engaging in false peace negotiations, attempting to buy time and consolidate its defenses. However, after three months and twenty days, the Kuomintang reactionaries have, on the one hand, exposed their incorrigible wickedness to the people; on the other hand, their organized strength, both militarily and politically, has rapidly disintegrated, unable to withstand a single blow from the People's Liberation Army. During this period, the People's Liberation Army not only won the sympathy of the people of the whole country and all those within the Kuomintang system who were willing to perform meritorious service, but also fully completed all preparations for crossing the Yangtze River, advancing south, and launching other new offensives. Therefore, once the Kuomintang refused to sign the peace agreement, it immediately advanced with the force of a whirlwind sweeping away leaves, determined to occupy wherever it pleased. The liberation of Nanjing officially marks the demise of Kuomintang rule. Even if the Kuomintang's remnants continue to eke out a temporary existence in Guangzhou, Taiwan, Guilin, and other places, they can no longer maintain any semblance of order. Now, the bandit chieftain Chiang Kai-shek and the counter-revolutionary diehards who cling to him have truly reached their final days. The Chinese people's democratic revolution is about to achieve complete victory, and no one but a madman would have the slightest doubt about it.

　　庆祝南京解放（一）
    捷报传来，横渡长江、所向无敌的人民解放军，已经解放了国民党二十二年来的反革命中心南京，并在三天的作战中，解放了长江沿岸东起无锡西至安庆的许多名城重镇。人民解放军正在长驱南下，扫荡残敌。同时，在太原前线，人民解放军也以三天的作战解放了山西省会太原。对于英勇作战的各路人民解放军将士，我们在此谨致最大的敬意。对于从地狱生活中获得解放的江南同胞和太原同胞，我们谨致慰问。国民党在今年一月以来曾经玩弄假和平阴谋，妄想借此赢得时间，巩固防线。但是经过三个月二十天的时间，国民党反动派一方面向人民暴露了它自己的怙恶不悛；另一方面，它的有组织的力量，无论在军事上和政治上，都已经迅速瓦解，无法抵挡人民解放军的一击。人民解放军在这个期间，不但在政治上赢得了全国人民和国民党系统内一切愿意立功自效的人们的同情，而且在军事上也充分地完成了渡江南进和其他新攻势的一切准备，所以国民党一旦拒绝鉴订和平协定，就立即以疾风扫落叶之势，奋勇前进，要占领那里便占领那里。南京的解放正式地表示了国民党统治的灭亡。国民党的残兵败将纵然还在广州、台湾、桂林等地苟延残喘于一时，已经再也维持不了一个什么局面了。现在匪首蒋介石以及依附匪首蒋介石的反革命死党，他们的末日真正到来了，中国人民民主革命即将取得完全的胜利，除了疯子以外谁也不会有丝毫怀疑了。
