　　I Shouldn't Be Unjustly Dismissed
　　Editor:
　　I am a young shop assistant who has been dismissed for no reason. Unemployment and hunger are closing in on me. I have been working as a shop assistant in a private store for more than three years. I have never made any mistakes. I have been working hard for the owner every day with loyalty. The manager often said to me, "You have to work hard, you have a lot of promise." When I heard this, I worked even harder for him. I don't know why, four or five days before the liberation of Beiping, they said they wanted to dismiss me, saying, "We don't need anyone in the store, you are too unpromising, go home!" My wages have been stopped for more than two months now. Yesterday, our manager said angrily again, "I dismissed you, and you still haven't left, what are you waiting for?" I said, "I can't find a job." The manager was even more angry, he said, "That's not my business, you have to leave immediately!" When the manager drove me away, he didn't even give me a penny for travel expenses. Editor, this poor unemployed young man is about to be expelled! I am about to starve. What should I do now? But I dare not write my real name! I also dare not state my address, please reply to me publicly.

　　Mr. Gao Xin:
　　We first express our sympathy for your plight of being unreasonably expelled by the shop owner. If you have indeed been unreasonably dismissed and your wages are being withheld, it is illegal. Please report the details to the labor union and ask them to help you find an appropriate solution.

专栏：询问与答复

　　不该无理解雇我编辑先生：
    我是一个无故被辞退的青年店员，失业饥饿接连逼来，我在一个私人商店里当店员，已有三年多了。从来没有犯过什么错误。每日忠实的给主家苦干。经理也常和我说：“你要好好的干，你很有希望”。我听了这话，给他苦干的就更有劲了。不知怎的，北平解放前四五天，就说要辞退我，说：“柜上不用人了、你也太没出息、回家去吧”！到现在我的工钱已停止两个多月了。昨天我们经理又很生气的说：“辞了你，你还不走，等什么？”我说：“我找不到职业。”经理更生气了，他说：“那我不管，你要马上走！”经理撵我的时候，一分钱的路费都没有给。编辑先生，我这穷困的失业青年马上就要被驱逐了！眼看就要挨饿，现在应当怎么办呢？可是我不敢写我的真名！也不敢说明我的地址，请公开答复我。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　读者告辛。告辛先生：
    我们首先对你被店主无理驱逐的困境寄予同情。如果真的是这样无理被解雇，并克扣工资，是违法的，请到工会声诉原委，请他们帮助你适当的解决。
