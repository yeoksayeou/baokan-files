　　Changzhi Cadres and Masses Donate Money and Grain to Aid Compatriots in Northern Henan Disaster Area

    [Taihang News] The people of Changzhi City are donating money and grain to aid compatriots in northern Henan who have suffered from the ravages of the Kuomintang bandit troops. On February 27th, cadres from all streets in the city, under the call of the Municipal Government, took the lead in mobilizing the masses in each street to raise donations. Because the citizens hated the Kuomintang bandit troops to the bone, they all voluntarily donated money and grain. Niu Xiaotou, from Dongguan Street, alone donated one dou of millet. Cadres from Longhua Street each donated 100 yuan Renminbi as a leading example, and the entire street donated a total of 2,910 yuan. In three days, the entire city donated a total of 48,755 yuan Renminbi, 1,469 jin of millet, and 111.5 jin of corn. All of this has now been sent to the Special Commissioner's Office for forwarding to northern Henan.

　　长治干部群众捐钱助米
  　救济豫北灾胞
    【太行讯】长治市群众对豫北受国民党匪军蹂躏的同胞进行捐助救济。二月二十七日全市街干部在市府号召下，带头在各街发动群众进行募捐，由于市民对国民党匪军恨之入骨，都纷纷自动捐钱助粮。东关街牛小秃一人即捐助小米一斗。龙华街干部在带头当中每人捐助了人民币一百元，全街共计捐二千九百一十元。三天中全市共捐助人民币四万八千七百五十五元，捐米一千四百六十九斤，玉茭一百一十一斤半。现已全部送往专署，以便转送豫北。
