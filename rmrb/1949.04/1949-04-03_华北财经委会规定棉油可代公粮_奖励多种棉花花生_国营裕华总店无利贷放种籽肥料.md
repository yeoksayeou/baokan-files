　　North China Financial and Economic Committee Stipulates Cottonseed Oil Can Substitute for Public Grain
  　Rewards Planting Various Types of Cotton and Peanuts
    State-Run Yuhua General Store Provides Interest-Free Loans for Seeds and Fertilizer
    [Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] In order to enhance the enthusiasm of farmers to increase the production of cotton and peanuts, the North China Financial and Economic Committee has issued a special notice regarding the method of using cotton and oil to substitute for the payment of public grain. After the liberation of Tianjin and Beijing, agricultural production must adapt to the needs of the cities and increase export goods. Increasing the production of cotton and peanuts has become an important task in this year's agricultural production plan. In order to guarantee the planting of cotton and peanuts, special regulations have been made for the method of using cotton and peanuts to substitute for the payment of public grain: Those who plant American cotton can use one jin of lint cotton to offset eight jin of public grain rice, one jin of peanut oil to offset five jin of public grain rice, and one jin of crude oil to offset four jin of rice. If the actual market price exceeds this ratio, the General Trading Company will purchase it at the market price. The North China Financial and Economic Committee has notified governments at all levels to conduct extensive publicity among farmers regarding the above regulations.
    [News from This Newspaper] In order to develop agricultural production, support the masses in planting large quantities of cotton and peanuts, and solve the difficulties of the masses in terms of fuel and seeds, the state-run Yuhua General Store, according to the instructions of the Jizhong Administrative Office and the Jizhong Trading Company, has decided to provide interest-free loans of large quantities of peanut and cotton seeds, as well as fertilizer and coal, to the masses in various counties and cities of the Eleventh Special District. It has now formally signed contracts with production promotion cooperatives in various counties. Last year, some areas in the Eleventh Special District experienced late planting due to spring drought, and suffered from floods and insect pests in the summer and autumn, resulting in relatively difficult living and production conditions for the masses this year. Since last winter, the Yuhua General Store has processed a large quantity of black beans into bean cakes through oil mills. Since the beginning of spring, in order to implement the agricultural production policy of 1949, the store has specially convened meetings of its subordinate branches to prepare large quantities of cotton and peanut seeds. In the previous stage, it had already sold more than 38,000 jin of bean cakes at prices lower than the market price in five counties and cities including Gaocheng, Ningjin, and Xinji, and allocated 1 million jin of cotton seeds to counties in the Ninth and Eleventh Special Districts, enough to plant approximately 140,000 mu of land. Recently, in order to further support the large-scale planting of peanuts and cotton and solve production and living difficulties, it has again provided interest-free loans of 95,000 jin of peanuts, enough to plant more than 3,160 mu, and 1 million jin of bean cakes, enough to fertilize 20,000 mu of land, through eight counties and cities including Zhao, Gao, Luan, Jin, Shen, and Xinji. The store has also formally ordered 20 million jin of coal from the Zhengtai Coal and Iron Company, which will be loaned to the masses at the original price of the coal mine plus transportation costs, to be repaid with cotton and peanuts in the autumn. On average, each jin of cotton can be exchanged for 44 to 54 jin of coal, which is about 10% lower than the market price. All of the above items are loaned to members of village cooperatives or cotton and peanut farmers through county and city production promotion cooperatives. In the contract formally signed on March 25, based on the principle of considering both public and private interests and ensuring repayment, the time and place of delivery and the pricing standards are clearly stipulated. When taking delivery of goods (coal and bean cakes), the price will be converted into peanuts or cotton based on the then-current market price of each county and city (bean cakes are 5% lower than the market price), and repayment will be made in full in the autumn without interest. The time and quality requirements for repayment are: peanuts must be repaid by the end of the Gregorian calendar year, with a guarantee of 9 liang of kernels per jin. Cotton must be repaid from the beginning of Bailu (White Dew) to the end of Hanlu (Cold Dew), guaranteeing that the cotton is dry and white. Those who wish to pay lint cotton (ginned cotton) can use 3 jin of lint cotton to offset 1 jin of unginned cotton. Furthermore, in order to take care of the difficulties in returning and transporting goods, it is stipulated that each borrowing household will be collected by the nearest general store, branch store, or county and city production promotion cooperative. The contract finally stipulates that both parties maintain credibility, and either party shall comply with the regulations. (Yao Fu)
