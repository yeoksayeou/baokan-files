　　Allowing Businessmen and Industrialists to Legally Operate in the New Democratic Society

　　Editor:
　　I used to make a living by running around doing business. Does this count as being a laborer? If this way of life is not allowed to exist, then my family's livelihood will be in trouble. Because I don't have enough capital to open a shop, and I don't know how to do manual labor. I think there are many people like me. Please point out a correct path for us to take. We would be truly grateful! Reader Yunzhang

　　Mr. Yunzhang:
　　The People's Government's attitude towards small business operators was made very clear in Chairman Mao's report "The Present Situation and Our Tasks" in 1947: "The object of the New Democratic Revolution is only to eliminate feudalism and monopoly capitalism, only the landlord class and the bureaucratic bourgeoisie (the big bourgeoisie), and not to generally eliminate capitalism, nor to eliminate the petty bourgeoisie and the middle bourgeoisie." At the same time, there is also a provision in the Land Law Outline of China: "Protect the property of industrialists and businessmen and their legitimate business operations from violation." The industrialists and businessmen mentioned here refer to all independent small industrialists and businessmen and all small and medium capitalist components. The protection mentioned here is only to protect industrialists and businessmen who abide by all industrial and commercial laws and policies of the People's Government, and speculative and manipulative industrialists and businessmen must be absolutely prohibited. The People's Government does not ban merchants from doing business, so you can rest assured to do business. However, merchants only profit from it and do not directly participate in production, so they cannot be considered laborers.

　　在新民主主义社会允许工商业者合法营业
    编辑先生：
    以往我是以来往跑生意的方式维持生活的，这算不算劳动者？如果这种方式不许可存在，那么一家生计就发生问题了。因为开铺子没有大本钱，做工不会。我想，同我一样的人也不少，请给我们指出一条正确的路走，我们真是衷心的感谢！  读者云章
    云章先生：
    人民政府对小本营商者的态度，在一九四七年毛主席“目前形势与我们的任务”的报告中说的已经很清楚：“新民主主义革命，所要消灭的对象只是封建主义与垄断资本主义，只是地主阶级与官僚资产阶级（大资产阶级），而不是一般地消灭资本主义，不是消灭小资产阶级与中等资产阶级”。同时中国土地法大纲上也有一条规定：“保护工商业者的财产及其合法的营业，不受侵犯”。这里所说的工商业者，就是指的一切独立小工商业者及一切小的与中等的资本主义成份。这里所说的保护，只是保护遵守人民政府一切工商业法令及政策的工商业者，而对投机操纵的工商业者，是绝对要予以禁止的。人民政府并不取缔商人经商，你可以放心做生意。不过商人只是从中取利，不是直接参加生产，所以不能算是劳动者。
