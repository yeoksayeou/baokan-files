　　Fangshan Tests Cadres
  　Shulu Inspects Learning
    [Chahar News] The Fangshan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party held a county-wide cadre examination at the end of last month's expanded cadre meeting, with a total of 201 participants. The test revealed that the vast majority of cadres had improved their understanding of current affairs and policies, and that their understanding of the basis and significance of carrying the revolution through to the end, as well as the Party's general line and general policies in land reform, was much clearer than before. In particular, they had a deeper understanding of the need to strengthen learning and oppose all disorganization and undisciplined phenomena in their work in order to do a good job. However, the shortcoming was that the pace of learning showed an imbalance between departments, districts, and cadres. For example, the Armed Forces Department averaged 69.6 points per person, the First District averaged 75 points, and the Sixth District averaged only 38.9 points. Comparing individual cadre scores, some scored 92 points, while others scored only 10 points. Therefore, the County Party Committee specifically proposed: (1) Each department must strengthen the organization of learning, with leaders taking the lead in learning and enforcing it on anyone who does not value learning. (2) Everyone should make a learning plan and check it regularly.

    [Jizhong News] The Shulu County Party Committee recently inspected the learning situation of cadres and found that, in general, the eleven directly subordinate departments were in a state of drift and formalism. The Public Security Bureau even had key cadres who could not adhere to the learning system. The Taxation Bureau completely abandoned learning during the crash work. The County Armed Forces Department, which had previously been relatively good at learning, was able to learn on time, but it was formalistic: discussions were very dull, and difficult issues were not explored deeply. The Shulu Branch of the People's Bank once grasped learning tightly, and also made a learning plan after the Lunar New Year, but due to the main cadres neglecting leadership, thinking that the learning committee was responsible for whether learning was good or bad, there were phenomena of late arrivals and early departures during learning; the teaching materials were also unplanned: one document was not finished before another was changed to be studied. Similar situations were found in other departments. The main reason for the slackening of learning was that the leading cadres of each department did not pay enough attention to learning, and some cadres were transferred south, and the learning organization was not adjusted in a timely manner. The county is now actively working on rectification.

　　房山测验干部
  　束鹿检查学习
    【察哈尔讯】中共房山县委于上月底的扩大干部会议上，举行全县干部测验，参加者共二百零一人。从此次测验中可看出：绝大部份干部对时事、政策的认识提高了一步，对必须将革命进行到底的根据和意义以及党在土地改革中的总路线和总政策的认识较以前明确多了。尤其是更深刻的认识了要想把工作作好，就必须加强学习和反对一切工作中的无组织无纪律现象，但缺点是：学习进度表现了部门与部门、区与区、干部与干部之间的不平衡。如武装部每人平均六十九·六分，一区平均七十五分，六区平均分数只三十八、九分。从干部个人成绩来比较，有的得九十二分，有的仅得十分。因此，县委特提出：（一）各部门必须加强学习组织，领导者带头学习，对任何不重视学习者强制之。（二）每人都订学习计划，定时检查。

    【冀中讯】束鹿县委近检查干部学习情形，发现直属十一个部门中，一般都陷于自流和形式主义状态。公安局甚至主要干部也不能坚持学习制度。税务局在突击工作中完全放弃了学习。过去学习比较好的县武装部，虽能按时学习，但是形式的：讨论中很沉闷，对疑难问题也不深究。人民银行束鹿支行虽一度学习抓得还紧，旧历年后也作了学习计划，但由于主要干部忽视领导，认为学习好坏有学习委员会负责，以致后来有学习时迟到早退的现象；教材方面也无计划：一本文件未学完又改学另一文件。其他部门也多类似情形。研究学习松弛的主要原因，乃是各部门领导干部对学习不够重视所致，加以某些干部南调，学习组织未得及时加以调整。该县现正积极着手整顿。
