　　Strictly Prevent Car Accidents
    The newspaper publishes a news item today regarding a car accident in the city of Beiping. In a city, this is a major issue. To ensure the safety of citizens and pedestrians and to establish good order in the city, we would like to once again call this to the attention of relevant parties.
    On April 1st, this newspaper put forward the suggestion of "preventing car accidents." However, car accidents have not decreased. In the twenty-eight days of February, there were twenty car accidents; in the first half of March, there were sixteen; and on April 15th alone, there were two. This number is alarming. In the people's city of Beiping, why haven't car accidents been eliminated? There are two main reasons: Some car drivers are not following the necessary traffic rules, and some other vehicles and pedestrians are careless while walking, lacking awareness. In fact, on roads crowded with pedestrians, vehicles, and horses, accidents can be prevented as long as one side pays attention.
    A car accident is a legal issue and an educational issue. Hitting someone is wrong, and it is even more wrong and illegal to flee the scene after hitting someone. For accidents that have occurred and may occur in the future, it is important to quickly determine right and wrong, distinguish responsibilities, and resolve them appropriately and fairly in accordance with the law. The most fundamental way to completely solve this problem is to strengthen education. Those who own cars should educate their drivers: In their own people's city, they should abide by traffic discipline, obey traffic commands, and maintain traffic order. In the event of an accident, they should bravely take responsibility and await handling. In addition, we call on pedestrians and the general public to pay close attention to complying with traffic regulations to avoid preventable accidents. Do not misinterpret "liberation" by thinking that you don't have to pay attention to anything, or that you can be careless and casual. Traffic police should be proactive and responsible, loyal to their duties, and take on the important task of maintaining traffic order. At the same time, they also have the responsibility to constantly educate the general public and car drivers in this regard. With this two-pronged approach, unexpected events can be avoided.

### 严防汽车闯祸

　　严防汽车闯祸
    本报今天发表了一个平市汽车肇祸的消息。在城市中，这是一个大问题。为了保障市民与行人的安全，建立城市良好的秩序，我们愿意再一次提请有关方面的注意。
    四月一日，本报就提出了“防止车祸”的意见。但是车祸并没有减少。在二月里的二十八天中，汽车肇祸二十起，三月上半月，发生了十六起，四月十五日一天，就发生了两起，这个数字是很惊人的。在人民的城市北平，为什么还没有消灭车祸呢？主要原因有两个：某些汽车司机没有遵守应有的交通守则；若干其他的车辆和行人走路时漠不经心，缺乏注意。事实上，在行人车马拥挤道上，只要有一方面注意起来，就可防止车祸发生。
    汽车肇事是个法律问题，也是个教育问题。撞了人是不对的，撞了人又私行逃逸更是错误的，违法的。对于已经发生和以后可能发生的肇祸事件，应该迅速辨明是非，分清责任，依法秉公，适当解决。彻底解决这个问题最基本的方法是加强教育。有汽车的人要教育汽车司机：在自己的人民城市中，应该遵守交通纪律，服从交通指挥，维护交通秩序。万一发生事故，应该勇敢担负起责任，听候处理。另外，我们号召行人和广大市民：很好的注意遵守交通规章以免发生可以避免的事故，不要曲解“解放”，认为什么都可不注意，可以马虎随便了。交通警察应该积极负责，忠于职守，很好的担负起维持交通秩序的重大任务，同时并有责任随时把这种意思向广大市民和汽车司机进行教育，这样双管齐下，就可以避免意外事件发生。
