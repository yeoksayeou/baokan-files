In the Former Beiyue District of Chahar Province, Collecting Old Loans While Correcting the Tendency of Coercive Orders

[Chahar News] Thanks to the efforts of cadres at all levels, certain achievements have been made in the work of collecting agricultural loans from 1948 in the former Beiyue District of Chahar Province. Last year, a total of 10,338,434 catties of grain and 10,048,943.5 yuan (Renminbi) were issued as loans. After the former Beiyue Administrative Office arranged the work of collecting agricultural loans last September, the counties generally attached great importance to this work. Ru Tang proposed "equal emphasis on collecting agricultural loans and conscription work." Tang County organized a large force to carry out this work and used market days to publicize agricultural loan policies. Therefore, both counties achieved great results. When carrying out this work, most areas adopted the method of first resolving the thinking of cadres, launching competitions, conducting typical experiments, rewarding the good, criticizing the bad, and giving the masses a deadline to repay the agricultural loans based on the actual situation. For example, the Pingxi Special District also collected mountain goods and medicinal materials, and Fuping County in the Jianping Special District combined this with supply and marketing businesses, collecting firewood, herbs, naked oats, etc., in addition to cloth. Currently, the entire district has recovered 5,281,749 catties of grain, accounting for 51 percent of the original loan amount, and 4,236,870.27 yuan, accounting for 41 percent of the original loan amount. The following deviations have occurred in the work: (1) Individual areas once proposed the slogan "Villages that do not pay off their debts will not be given loans." The good aspect of this is that it makes the masses supervise each other, but it easily leads to forced debt collection. For example, the village chief of Nanguan Village in Quyang County was afraid that he would not be able to repay the loan, which would affect the entire village's ability to obtain loans, so he sold livestock to repay the agricultural loan. (2) Some cadres issued coercive orders. In individual villages in Chahanam, incidents of tying up people occurred. (3) Cadres in individual counties were "sightseeing on horseback," visiting several villages in one day, and their work was not thorough. The leadership is currently correcting various deviations in the work and plans to complete it by the end of April.

　　察省原北岳区收旧贷中
  　纠正强迫命令偏向
    【察哈尔讯】察省原北岳区部份一九四八年的农贷催收工作，由于各级干部的努力，已收到一定成绩。去年共发放贷粮一千零三十三万八千四百三十四斤，款（人民币，下同）一千零四十八万九千四百三十一元五角。去年九月原北岳行署布置了催收农贷工作后，一般的县份对此工作相当重视，如此唐提出“催收农贷与征收工作并重”，唐县曾组织了很大力量去进行这一工作，并利用集市宣传农贷政策。因此，该两县成绩都很大。各地在进行这一工作时，大部采取了首先打通干部思想，发动竞赛，典型试验，奖励好的，批评坏的，根据实际情形给群众以归还农贷的限期的方式。如平西专区兼收山货、药材，建屏专区阜平县与供销业务结合，除收布外，并收柴草、山药、莜面等。现全区已收回粮五百二十八万一千七百四十九斤，占原贷数百分之五十一；款四百二十三万六千八百七十元二角七分，占原贷数百分之四十一。工作中曾发生以下偏向：（一）个别地区曾提出“哪村还不清，不贷给哪村”的口号。这样作，好的方面是使群众互相督促，但容易形成逼债现象，如曲阳县南关村长怕还不了，影响全村贷不上款，就卖牲口还农贷。（二）有的干部强迫命令，察南个别村曾发生捆人现象。（三）个别县份的干部，“走马观花”，一天走几个村，工作不深入。领导上现正在纠正工作中的各种偏向中，计划于四月底完成。　　　　　　　　　　　　（兴）
