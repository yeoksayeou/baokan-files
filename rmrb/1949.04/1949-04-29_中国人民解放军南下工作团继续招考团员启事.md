Announcement of the Southward Work Group of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Continuing to Recruit Members

　　Now that the domestic peace agreement has been rejected by the reactionary Kuomintang government, our People's Liberation Army's million-strong force has crossed the Yangtze River. The capital of the reactionary Kuomintang government, Nanjing, has also been liberated by our army. Other cities will become the property of the people as soon as our army arrives. The task of our group going south to carry out takeover work is already urgently pressing. In addition to stepping up the completion of the education plan for existing members in order to depart ahead of schedule, and in order to take care of the recent requests from many young students to participate in southward work, and considering the rapid progress of the People's Liberation Army, the need for personnel to work will inevitably be greater. Therefore, it is decided to publish another recruitment notice. All those who are determined to participate in the southward takeover work in this great revolutionary victory struggle and who meet the requirements of the previous recruitment notice for members of this group may go directly to the following locations to register and be tested at any time. This is the announcement.

　　　　　　　　Commander-in-Chief: Tan Zheng　Deputy Commander-in-Chief: Tao Zhu　Shao Shiping

　　Registration and examination locations are listed below:

　　Beiping: 1. General Headquarters of the Southward Work Group, Dongsi Toutiao　2. No. 30 Jiutiao Hutong, Dongsi Pailou　3. Headquarters of the Third Detachment of the Southward Work Group, Zhantan Temple
