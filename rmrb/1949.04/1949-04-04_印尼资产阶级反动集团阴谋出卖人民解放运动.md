Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 3rd: Various sources indicate that the Indonesian reactionary bourgeois clique is attempting to further betray the Indonesian people's national liberation movement. According to a TASS report, the Security Council passed a new proposal on the Indonesian question by the United States' assistant, the Canadian representative, on March 23rd. Ignoring the opposition of the Soviet representative and world democratic public opinion, the resolution openly agreed to the Dutch convening the so-called Hague Round Table Conference, which attempts to destroy Indonesia. However, the Netherlands should first release Hatta and others before holding the conference, and the United Nations Indonesian Committee, controlled by the United States, should convene a so-called "preparatory meeting" in Yogyakarta between the Netherlands and Indonesia. This is the result of behind-the-scenes bargaining between American and Dutch imperialists. The United States' eagerness to have the Netherlands release Hatta and others is an attempt to use Hatta to split the Indonesian guerrillas, and then have Hatta exclude the Dutch. After the US representative to the Security Council, Austin, expressed support for the Canadian proposal, the Indonesian representative, Palar, canceled his opposition to the Dutch Round Table Conference plan. The Dutch representative, van Royen, also expressed agreement with the Canadian proposal on the 23rd. On the same day, the Security Council instructed the Indonesian Committee to convene a preparatory meeting. Invited by the committee, Hatta stated that he must first consult with other former leaders of the Republic in Yogyakarta. According to an Associated Press dispatch on March 30th, former Indonesian Republic Minister of the Interior Soekiman (leader of the extreme right-wing Masyumi Islamic Party) has been granted permission by the Dutch to return to Yogyakarta from his hideout in East Java. On the same day, an Associated Press dispatch revealed that the former core troops of the Indonesian Republic, the Siliwangi Division, have been "entrusted by the Dutch to maintain order in certain areas south and east of Bandung in West Java." On March 31st, Agence France-Presse and United Press, citing a Dutch Army communique from Batavia, confirmed the news, stating that five battalions of the Siliwangi Division, totaling 4,500 men (the division has a total of twelve battalions), have agreed to cooperate with the Dutch army in clearing "troublemakers."

　　印尼资产阶级反动集团阴谋出卖人民解放运动
    【新华社北平三日电】各方消息显示：印尼反动资产阶级集团，正图继续出卖印尼人民的民族解放运动。据塔斯社报导，安理会曾于三月二十三日通过美国的助手加拿大代表对印尼问题的新提案。该议案不顾苏联代表和世界民主舆论的反对，公开同意荷兰召集企图灭亡印尼的所谓海牙圆桌会议；但荷兰应在举行该会之前，首先放出哈达等人，并且由美国控制的联合国印尼委员会在日惹召集荷兰、印尼双方，举行一个所谓“预备会议”。这是美荷帝国主义者背着安理会进行讨价还价的结果。美国急欲使荷兰释放哈达等出来的目的是企图利用哈达等分裂印尼游击队，然后再使哈达去排挤荷兰。在美国驻安理会代表奥斯汀表示支持加拿大提案后，印尼代表帕拉尔取消了对荷兰圆桌会议计划的反对。荷兰代表罗延亦于二十三日对加拿大提案表示同意。安理会另于同日训令印尼委员会召集预备会议。在该委员会邀请下，哈达表示须先与前共和国其他首领在日惹举行会商。据美联社三月三十日电透露，前印尼共和国内政部长苏基曼（极右翼的马希乌希回教党头子）已得到荷方允许，自其东爪哇的隐匿地回到日惹。同日美联社电透露，前印尼共和国的基干部队希利旺师团所部，已被荷方“委托在西爪哇万隆以南与以东的若干地区维持秩序”。三十一日，法新社与合众社引巴达维亚荷兰陆军公报证实该消息称：希利旺师团的五个营四千五百人（该师共十二个营），已同意在清除“扰乱分子”上与荷军合作。
