　　Cangzhou New China Flour Company
  　Shorter Work Hours, Higher Efficiency
    [Jizhong News] Workers at the state-owned New China Flour Company in Cangzhou, inspired ideologically and following the democratic wage assessment in March, have become more active in their work, leading to improved efficiency. The daily flour production has increased from 1,100 bags during the enemy-puppet regime to 1,400 bags. Coal consumption per bag of flour has decreased from over 20 jin during the enemy-puppet regime to 14 jin. Their enthusiasm for learning has also increased; they often seize work breaks to read newspapers and write. However, they worked 12 hours a day, and rotated night shifts every other week, which was physically exhausting, affecting their work and study. In order to care for the workers' health and increase their study time, the company, starting from the 14th of this month, changed from a two-shift system to a three-shift system with the existing number of workers, with each shift working eight hours a day. This was unanimously supported by all workers, who believed that although the number of workers would be smaller, and the work would inevitably be more intensive, the shorter work hours would provide enough time for rest, study, recreation, and helping others. Therefore, they guarantee the current daily production.

　　沧州市新中国面粉公司
  　工时缩短效率提高
    【冀中讯】沧州市国营新中国面粉公司工人，经过思想启发，和三月份民主评定工资后，工作积极，郊率提高。面粉的日产量已由敌伪时一千一百袋增至一千四百袋，每袋面的燃煤量由敌伪时期二十余斤减至十四斤。学习情绪也提高了，常常抓紧工作空隙读报写字。但是，他们每日有十二小时的工作，且每隔一周就轮夜班，身体很累，影响工作学习。该公司为了顾全工人们的健康和增加学习时间，自本月十四日起在原有的人数上，将两班制改为三班制，每天工作八小时。获得全体工人一致拥护。认为人数虽少了，工作不免紧张些，但工时减短了，有足够的时间休息、学习、娱乐和抽空去帮助别人。故此保证现在的日产量。
