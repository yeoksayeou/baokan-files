　　Our Policy on Private Banking and Money Businesses

　　Private banking and money businesses can play two roles in the New Democratic economy: On the one hand, through their legitimate deposit and loan, remittance, and other legitimate businesses, they play a positive role in regulating social capital and supporting the development of industries and businesses that are beneficial to the national livelihood. This should be protected and allowed to exist and develop. On the other hand, if they go beyond the scope of legitimate business and use deposits for speculation and hoarding, they will not only fail to play a positive role in regulating social capital and supporting the development of industries and businesses that are beneficial to the national livelihood, but will also fuel price fluctuations and hinder the development of legitimate industries and businesses, which is harmful to the national economy. Therefore, we must strictly manage private banking and money businesses, promote and restrict their development only in ways that are beneficial to the national livelihood, and ban all illegal speculative activities. Only in this way can we facilitate the development of production and benefit the broad masses of the people; only in this way can we meet the requirement of turning consumer cities into production cities. This is our basic policy towards private banking and money businesses. The promulgation of the "Provisional Measures for the Management of Private Banking and Money Businesses in the North China Region" yesterday is the concretization of this policy.
　　Production is the foundation of all economic activities, so banking and money businesses engaged in monetary credit and acceptance are subordinate to production and should serve production. If it deviates from the needs of production, it will inevitably embark on the road of speculation and adventure. What the reactionary Kuomintang has done in the economy for more than ten years can be summarized as facilitating the plunder of the broad masses of the people by imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, thereby hindering the development of production and causing most of the national capital to deviate from production and turn to speculation. General banks, silver houses, and money shops have also deviated from their legitimate business of regulating social finance to support the production of the industrial sector, and have engaged in financial speculation and other speculative businesses. Especially in the context of war, many private banking and money businesses have absorbed idle social capital and engaged in hoarding and speculation, extracting illegal profits. The so-called "national banks" controlled by the four major families not only did not fight against these speculative activities, but also specialized in leading speculation and plundering the wealth of the people across the country to enrich the private pockets of the four major families. Therefore, in the recent ten years of reactionary Kuomintang rule, private banks and shops have sprung up like mushrooms after a rain, flourishing. This abnormal development of banking and money businesses does not indicate the prosperity of the national economy, but rather the decline of the national economy to the point of near bankruptcy. Whether private banking and money businesses engage in speculative activities themselves or provide funds to help merchants engage in speculation, their activities are harmful to production. We must thoroughly eliminate this ugly face of private banking and money businesses left over from the rule of the reactionary Kuomintang, and must place private banking and money businesses correctly on the correct foundation of developing production. Articles 4, 5, and 6 of the "Measures for the Management of Private Banking and Money Businesses in the North China Region" regarding the scope of business, Articles 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12 regarding capital, and Articles 15, 16, 17, and 18 regarding the use of funds and deposit reserve requirements, are all based on this spirit. This is very appropriate and necessary in terms of stabilizing finance, developing production, and protecting the rights of depositors. In terms of private banking and money businesses themselves, these provisions are also very appropriate and necessary. Without this, it would be impossible for private banking and money businesses to play a positive role in the development of the national economy; without this, it would be impossible to prevent private banking and money businesses from taking the road of speculation and adventure; without this, it would affect the stability of the market and the development of the national economy, thereby causing private banking and money businesses to lose the basis for existence and development.
　　North China has been completely liberated. Our overriding central task in North China in the future is production. Our national economy is in a very backward state. Only by developing the state-owned economy, the private economy, and the cooperative economy together can we hope to improve our production level in a considerable period of time and gradually transform our country from an agricultural country into an industrial country. Corresponding to this situation is: if private banking and money businesses abide by laws and regulations, operate legitimate businesses, and are needed for industrial, agricultural, and commercial production, they can exist and develop. However, if private banking and money businesses still want to follow the bad practices of the reactionary Kuomintang era, and do not want to do something useful in the New Democratic production and construction, but only want to seize opportunities to make a quick buck, then they will cut off their own future. Because the New Democratic economy cannot allow this phenomenon to continue to exist. Our state-owned economy, especially the state banks, must resolutely fight against all illegal speculative activities for the benefit of the people. The Chinese people will use their own labor and wisdom to develop production and consolidate their victory. The Chinese people love all undertakings that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood, and beneficial to the development of production; and hate all speculative reselling and self-enriching behaviors. Whoever conforms to this wish can exist, otherwise they will be eliminated.

### 我们的私营银钱业政策

专栏：社论

　　我们的私营银钱业政策
    私营银钱业在新民主主义经济中可能起两方面的作用：一方面是经过其正当的存放款、汇兑和其他正当业务，起着调剂社会资金和扶助有益于国民生计的工商业发展的积极作用。这是应当受到保护和被允许存在与发展的。另一方面如果它们越出正当的业务范围，利用存款投机囤积，则又不仅不能起调剂社会资金和扶助有益于国民生计的工商业发展的积极作用，反而会助长物价波动，妨碍正当工商业的发展，对国民经济是有害的。为此我们对私营银钱业就必须严加管理，促使并限制其只能向有益于国民生计的方面发展，取缔其一切非法投机的行为。只有这样，才有利于发展生产，并有利于广大人民；只有这样，才符合于把消费城市变成生产城市的要求。这就是我们对私营银钱业的基本政策。昨天华北区私营银钱业管理暂行办法的颁布，则正是这一政策的具体化。
    生产是一切经济活动的基础，所以从事于货币信用受授的银钱业，是从属于生产，并应为生产服务的。如果脱离了生产的需要，就必然走上投机、冒险的道路。十余年来反动的国民党在经济上所做的事情，概括言之，就是便利帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义对广大人民的掠夺，因而阻碍生产发展，使大部分的民族资本脱离生产，转向投机事业。一般银行、银号、钱庄亦脱离其调剂社会金融，以扶助工业界生产的正当业务，而从事于金融投机，以及其他投机事业。特别在战争的情况下，许多私营银钱业吸收了社会闲散资金，从事囤积居奇，勒取非法利润。而四大家族控制下的所谓“国家银行”，则不但不与这些投机行为作斗争，而是专门领导投机，掠夺全国人民的财富，以充实四大家族的私囊。所以在反动的国民党统治的最近十余年来，私人行庄如雨后春笋，蓬勃发展。这种银钱业的畸形发展，并不表示国民经济的繁荣，相反的是国民经济衰落，以至临近破产的表现。私营银钱业，不管它们自己进行投机活动或者供给资金帮助商人进行投机，它们的活动都是对生产事业有害的。我们对于反动的国民党统治所遗留下来的私营银钱业这个丑恶面，必须彻底肃清，必须把私营银钱业端正的放在发展生产的正确基础上。“华北区私营银钱业管理办法”第四、五、六等条在业务范围方面的规定，第八、九、十、十一、十二等条在资金方面的规定，及第十五、十六、十七、十八等条在资金运用及存款准备金方面之规定，正是根据这种精神。这在稳定金融、发展生产、保障存款人权利上说，都是十分应该和必要的。即在私营银钱业本身说，这些规定也是十分应该和必要的。不如此就不可能使私营银钱业对国民经济的发展起积极作用，不如此就不能防止私营银钱业走投机冒险的道路，不如此就会影响市场的稳定和国民经济的发展，从而使私营银钱业丧失了存在和发展的根据。
    华北已全部解放。我们华北区今后压倒一切的中心任务是生产。我们国民经济处于十分落后的状态，只有把国营经济、私营经济和合作经济统统发展起来，才有希望在相当时期内，提高我们的生产水平，使我们的国家逐渐的由农业国变成工业国。和这种情况相适应的是：如果私营银钱业遵守法令，经营正当业务，为工农商业生产所需要，它是可以存在的和发展的。但是如果私营银钱业还想因袭反动的国民党时代的坏作风，不在新民主主义的生产建设中做一部分有益的事情，只想看机会钻空子捞一把，那么它就会自绝前途。因为新民主主义经济是不能容许这种现象继续存在的。我们的国营经济，尤其是国家银行，为了人民利益，是一定要坚决和一切非法投机行为做斗争的。中国人民要用自己的劳动和智慧来发展生产，巩固自己的胜利。中国人民喜爱一切有益于国计民生，有益于生产发展的事业；憎恶一切投机倒把，损公利私的行为。谁顺应这种愿望就能存在，否则就会被淘汰。
