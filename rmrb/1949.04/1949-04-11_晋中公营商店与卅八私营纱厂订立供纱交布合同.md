　　Jinzhong Public Store Signs Yarn Supply and Cloth Delivery Contract with Thirty-Eight Private Textile Factories
    [Jinzhong Telegram] To improve the product quality of private cotton textile industry, the Taiyuan City Trading Company and Tongtai Store have signed a yarn supply and cloth delivery processing contract with private cotton textile factories in Yuci. Recently, private cotton textile industries in various parts of Jinzhong have been solely pursuing profits, resulting in extremely poor product quality and sluggish sales, which have affected industrial development and workers' lives. Under the principle of considering both public and private interests, Tongtai Store first signed a yarn supply and cloth delivery contract with the Yuci Cotton Textile Industry Association on the 15th of this month. The contract stipulates that the weight of sizing for each bolt of cloth must not exceed one jin; each bolt of cloth must be eleven zhang (Chinese feet, same below) long, two chi six cun wide, and weigh eleven jin four liang; the density must be fourteen warp threads and twelve weft threads for every two cloth eyelets, etc. Those who meet the standards will be rewarded, and those who do not meet the standards will not be accepted. Those who violate or intentionally sabotage this contract will be subject to appropriate punishment or ordered to suspend operations by the Trading Company, the Cotton Textile Industry Association, and the government in coordination (Editor's note: If the contract is violated, the government can be coordinated to enforce the contract according to law. It is not necessary to stipulate "punishment" or "suspension of operations" in the contract). Currently, nearly twenty private cotton textile factories in Yuci, such as Jincheng, Jin Yi, and He Cheng, have signed the above contract with Tongtai Store. Tongtai Store has also instructed its branches to sign contracts with local cotton textile factories based on this principle and according to local conditions. Currently, the Taigu and Hongtai Stores of the Trading Company have signed contracts with six private cotton textile factories; the Pingyao Fenghua Mao Store of the Trading Company has also signed contracts with eight private cotton textile factories. At present, the workers in the various private factories that have signed contracts are actively urging their factories to implement this contract and improve product quality.
