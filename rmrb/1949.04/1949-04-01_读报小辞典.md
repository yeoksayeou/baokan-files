　　Gorky—(Original name Alexei Maximovich Peshkov) was the greatest writer of the Soviet Union. He inherited the excellent traditions of Russian classical literature and created the new art of socialist realism. He laid the foundation for young Soviet literature.
　　In 1868, Gorky was born in Nizhny Novgorod, Russia (now Gorky City). His grandfather was a sailor, and his father was a furniture maker. He became an orphan in his childhood. From the age of ten, he was an apprentice, worked as a handyman on a ship, caught birds, acted as a stagehand in a theater, worked as a baker, stevedore, and railway clerk. In his youth, he developed revolutionary enthusiasm due to poverty and oppression.
　　In 1892, when he was an unknown worker in a railway factory, he published his first short story "Makar Chudra" in the "Caucasus" newspaper. In 1898, he published two novels and a collection of essays, and began to gain fame. These novels and his 1899 "Foma Gordeyev" all depicted the lower classes, exposing the hypocrisy and greed of the bourgeoisie. During the era of Tsarist autocracy and reaction, the Tsarist government used arrests and exile to force him to stop revolutionary writing, but he was not afraid of violence. He became closer to the Bolshevik Party and actively participated in revolutionary activities. Among his lifelong masterpieces are "The Song of the Stormy Petrel," "Mother," and his autobiographical trilogy "Childhood," "In the World," "My Universities," as well as "The Life of Klim Samgin" written after the October Revolution.
　　His close contact with revolutionary leaders Lenin and Stalin facilitated his work. His pen and his activities were powerful weapons against fascism. The enemy saw this, so in 1936 he was murdered by Trotskyite-Bukharinite elements hired by fascists. But Gorky's writings are immortal, and peace-loving people all over the world are following the path illuminated by his brilliant works.

    高尔基——（原名阿列克斯·马克西莫维奇·皮石柯夫）是苏联最伟大的作家，他继承了俄国古典文学的优良传统，创造了社会主义现实主义的新艺术，他奠定了年青的苏维埃文学基础。
    一八六八年，高尔基生于俄国尼治尼。诺佛戈洛德城（现已改为高尔基城），他的祖父是一个水手，父亲是个家具匠，他在幼年就成了孤儿，十岁起当学徒，到轮船上打过杂，抓过鸟儿，到剧院跑过龙套，当过面包师，码头夫和铁路职员。在他年青时，就因遭受穷苦和压迫而具有革命热情。
    一八九二年当他是一个铁路工厂的无名工人时，在“高加索”报发表了第一部短篇小说“玛加尔·邱德拉”，一八九八年他又发表了两部小说和小品文集后，开始博得声誉。这些小说和他一八九九年的“福玛·高尔捷耶夫”都是写下层平民的，他揭露了资产阶级的虚伪与贪婪。在俄国专制反动的年代，沙皇政府用逮捕和充军威迫他停止革命写作，但他不畏强暴，更接近了布尔塞维克党，积极的参加了革命活动。在他毕生的名著中，有“海燕”，“母亲”和他的自传三部曲“童年”，“在人间”，“我的大学”，以及十月革命后所写的“克里姆·沙木金的一生”。
    他和革命领袖列宁，斯大林密切接触，便利了他的工作。他的笔和他的活动是反法西斯主义的有力武器，敌人看到了这一点，所以他在一九三六年被法西斯雇用的托落茨基分子布哈林分子谋害了。但是高尔基的著作是不朽的，全世界爱好和平的人民，都跟随着他的光辉的著作行进。
