When the Special Edition Came Out
　　Sketches of the Streets of Beiping

　　Yesterday, April 21st, all the people of Beiping angrily heard the news that the Nanjing Kuomintang government had refused to sign the domestic peace agreement. People cursed the Kuomintang reactionaries for once again demonstrating their lack of sincerity for peace. At the same time, soldiers, workers, students, and citizens excitedly listened to and discussed Chairman Mao's and Commander-in-Chief Zhu's orders to advance, saying, "Now we can achieve real peace."

　　Slightly after noon, the city's radios became the focus of attention. When the radio station loudly broadcast Chairman Mao's and Commander-in-Chief Zhu De's order for the People's Liberation Army to bravely advance, the streets and alleys were filled with people gathered around many radios. The announcer broadcast this solemn order clearly and steadily, and every word of the order deeply stirred the hearts of every listener. People eagerly awaited this mobilization order, waiting for the days of the great advance.

　　The news spread like wildfire, quickly spreading throughout factories, schools, and government offices... The whole of Beiping was in an uproar. Everyone was concerned and talking about it, while soldiers and cadres discussed when to head south.

　　Around 3 o'clock in the afternoon, the "Special Edition" came out. Before the "Special Edition" was published, the front of our newspaper office was surrounded by enthusiastic readers. The newspaper boys anxiously waited to bring this big news to all the people of Beiping as soon as possible.

　　At 3:40, our newspaper first sent out two cars to deliver the "Special Edition." In Qianmen and Xidan—the cars were often surrounded by the masses, and countless hands reached in through the car windows, all wanting to get a copy first. As the cars drove off, people still clung to the cars, running alongside. A bicycle repairman by the roadside read the "Special Edition" and said, "The Kuomintang are simply bastards, they've completely made fools of themselves. Chiang Kai-shek is just that kind of trash, there's no other way but to fight!" An old man with a cane said, "Ah! The Kuomintang should have been fought long ago! Our Chairman Mao was really too lenient in the past!" Several young students on Wangfujing Street excitedly read every word of the "Special Edition," one student eagerly said, "The peace talks expired on April 20th, I went to the newspaper early this morning, but didn't see any news, I had expected this move from the Kuomintang long ago. Without fighting, there can be no peace! Chairman Mao's order is correct! Fight!..." The patrol soldiers on duty in Dongdan also gathered next to the newspaper boys, vying to see the news, they were so calm and tense, after reading it, they smiled and walked away confidently.

　　Dusk fell, the newspaper boys forgot the day's fatigue, running excitedly, from the streets to the alleys, selling the last copies in their hands. Before dark, the 20,000 copies of the "Special Edition" printed by our newspaper were snatched up by the citizens. (Attached picture)

　　号外出来的时候
  　北平街头速写
    昨天，四月廿一日，全北平的人民愤怒的听到南京国民党政府拒绝在国内和平协定上签字的消息。人们咒骂国民党反动派又一次表现了没有和平诚意。同时战士们、工人们、学生们、市民们兴奋的倾听着、交谈着毛主席、朱总司令进军的命令，人们说：“这一下就能实行真正的和平了。”
    中午稍过，全市的收音机成了人们注意的中心。当广播电台响亮地广播出毛主席和朱德总司令命令人民解放军奋勇进军的命令时，大街上、胡同里，许多广播器的周围都站满了人。广播员清晰稳重地广播这个庄严的命令，命令的每一个字句都深深地激荡在每个听众的心上。人们殷切地等待着这个动员令，等待着大进军的日子。
    消息如野火飞传，迅速传遍工厂、学校和机关……整个北平都轰动了。人人都在关心地交谈着它，战士们和干部们则商量着何时南下。
    下午三点多钟，“号外”出来了。“号外”出版以前，本报门前就被热心的读者围满了。报童们焦急地等待着，早一点把这个大消息带给全北平的人民。
    三点四十分，本报首先开出了两辆汽车，传送“号外”。在前门、在西单——车子经常被群众包围起来，车窗里伸进无数只手，谁都想先得到一张。车子开动了，人们仍然扒满车身，跟着飞跑。马路旁一个修理自行车的工人看了“号外”说：“国民党简直混蛋，洋相总算出足了。蒋介石就是这么块货，不打不行！”一个拄着手杖的老头说：“唉！国民党早就该打啊！咱们毛主席过去真是太宽大了啊！”王府井大街几个年青的学生在兴奋地读者“号外”上的每一个字句，一个学生抢着说：“四月二十日和谈到期，我今天一早就去看报，可是没有看到消息，我早就料到国民党这一手。不打就不能和毛主席的命令对！打！……”在东单值勤的纠察队战士也凑到报童的旁边，争看这个消息，他们是那样的镇静而紧张，看完以后，才笑着读着，满有信心的走了开去。
    黄昏了，报童们忘记了一天的疲劳，奋兴地跑着，从大街到巷口，售卖手中最后的一张。不到天黑，本报印的两万份“号外”，就被市民抢光了。（附图片）
