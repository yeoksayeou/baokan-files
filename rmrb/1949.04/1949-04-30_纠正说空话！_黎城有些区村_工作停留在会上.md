　　Correct Empty Talk!
  　In Some Districts and Villages of Licheng
  　Work Remains in Meetings
    [Our Newspaper News] Our newspaper reporter Li Wen reports: In the spring plowing preparation work in Licheng, some districts and some cadres showed lax leadership and a bureaucratic work style of not earnestly going deep into the masses to understand the production situation, resulting in losses to production work. After the county's production mobilization meeting, the cadres of the Fourth District returned from the county to the district. It happened to be a large temple fair in the villages of the district, and the vast majority of cadres, even the district secretary and district chief, left their work posts to attend the fair, resulting in the cessation of leadership in production work for three consecutive days throughout the district. In addition, the original decision to immediately convene a meeting of women activists in the key villages after returning to the district was also delayed for five or six days until April 1st, delaying the development of the large-scale production movement. In the recent meetings of production key village team leaders held in each district of the county, a common phenomenon was exposed, namely, that most cadres did not understand the production situation in the villages, nor did they understand the specific production situation of a team or several households of farmers. They only knew in general terms: "All kinds of meetings have been held, production increase plans have been arranged, and the enthusiasm of the masses is very high!" They lacked in-depth understanding and research into specific problems in production. These comrades did not go deep into the masses to work, but simply urged the village cadres, or limited the leadership of production to "holding meetings." For example, the district cadres who went to Xiaozhai Village in the Sixth District held thirteen meetings in fourteen days, but did not understand what problems actually existed in the village. Comrade Niu of the Nanweiquan work team did not study and solve the actual problems of mass production, adopted a liberal attitude towards the decisions of higher authorities, and independently evaluated land. In addition, there were also a few cadres who did not lead the masses to cultivate according to the production conditions and regional characteristics of the masses, but only based on their own subjective views. Songhou Village in the Fourth District is mostly hillside land, with high altitude and strong winds, and is not suitable for early harrowing, but the district cadres emphasized early harrowing, and as a result, five mu of land that was harrowed was blown away by the wind. The county party committee has begun to pay attention to correcting the above bureaucratic work style in production leadership.

　　纠正说空话！
  　黎城有些区村
  　工作停留在会上
    【本报讯】本报记者力文报导：黎城在春耕准备工作中，在部分地区、部份干部中表现了领导松懈，不认真深入群众了解生产情况的官僚主义作风，致使生产工作受到损失。该县生产动员大会结束后，四区区干部自县返区，适逢该区村庄有较大庙会，绝大多数干部甚至区书、区长在内都离开工作岗位去赶会，以致一连三天，全区停止了生产工作的领导。另外原决定回区后立即召开了基点村妇女积极分子会议，也拖延了五六天至四月一日才召开了拖延了大生产运动的开展。在最近全县各区，分别召开的生产基点村组长会议上，普遍的暴露了一种现象，即大部分干部不了解村中的生产情况，不了解一个组或几户农民的具体生产情况，只笼统知道：“各种会都开过了，增产布置了，群众情绪很高！”对生产中具体问题则缺乏深入了解与研究。这些同志没有深入到群众中去行工作，而只是简单的督促村干部，或把生产领导，停留在“开会上”。如去六区小寨村的区干部，十四天开了十三个会，该村究竟存在什么问题，却不了解。南委泉工作组的牛同志，对群众生产的实际问题不加研究解决，对上级决议抱自由主义态度，孤立的去评丈土地。另外也有少数干部，不根据群众的生产条件、地区特点，只凭主观去领导群众进行耕耘。四区松后村多是山坡地，地高风多，不宜早耙，但区干部强调早耙，结果耙了五亩地，都被风刮坏了。对以上生产领导中的官僚主义作风，该县县委已开始注意纠正。
