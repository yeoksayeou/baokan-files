　　Hebei-Shandong-Henan Grain Prices Rise Slightly
  　Trade Company Sells Grain to Stabilize Prices
    [Hebei-Shandong-Henan Dispatch] The Hebei-Shandong-Henan Trade Company has taken effective measures to once again stabilize the seasonal increase in grain prices in the region. Starting March 9th, grain prices rose generally throughout the region, and remained unstable until early April. In early April, the prices of industrial products tended to fall. Grain was led by sorghum and soybeans, followed by wheat and millet. Between March 9th and March 30th, grain prices in the region's major markets generally rose by about 10 to 45 percent. Prices in early April exceeded this number. During the same period, industrial products fell by about 20 percent. The main reason for the increase in grain prices was that farmers had little grain in storage in the spring, and the amount on the market decreased. For example, in Heze it decreased by about 40 percent. In addition, the masses needed a large amount of bean cake for fertilizer in this year's agricultural production increase campaign, and at the same time, the sales of soybean oil in cities were smooth. Therefore, soybeans had the largest number of transactions on the market, and the price also rose accordingly. Cotton prices were also relatively strong due to a large increase in demand from textile factories in large cities.
    The characteristic of this grain price fluctuation was a seasonal and steady rise throughout the region. However, there are still a few speculative grain merchants storing grain and waiting for higher prices, and even individual speculative merchants entrusting others to buy grain on their behalf, which further pushed up grain prices. In order to regulate demand and stabilize prices, our region's trade company has, since April 1st, sold grain in large quantities at prices lower than the market prices in various parts of the region, while also coordinating with the contraction of currency. Market grain prices have gradually fallen in recent days.

　　冀鲁豫粮价微升
  　贸易公司售粮平抑
    【冀鲁豫电】冀鲁豫贸易公司采取有效措施，再次稳定本区粮价季节性的上涨。三月九日起，全区粮价普遍上升，到四月初尚动荡未定。四月上旬工业品价格则趋于下落。粮食以红粮、元豆带头，小麦、小米跟进。三月九日及三月三十日，本区各主要市场粮价一般上升百分之十到百分之四十五左右。四月初价格，尚超出此数。同一时期的工业品，均跌落百分之二十左右。粮价上涨的主要原因，是春季农民存粮不多，上市量减少。如荷泽即减少百分之四十左右。加以群众在本年农业增产运动中，需要大量豆饼肥地，同时城市豆油销路顺畅，所以元豆在市场上成交数最大，价格亦随之上升。棉花则因大城市纺织厂需量大增，价格亦较坚挺。
    这次粮价波动，其特点为季节性的稳升，遍于全区。但仍有少数投机粮商储粮观望，甚至有个别的投机商人转托他人出面买进粮食，致更推动粮价上涨。我区贸易公司为调剂需求，平抑物价，自四月一日起，特在本区各地，以低于市场的价格，大批出售，同时配合了收缩通货，市场粮价，日来已渐低落。
