Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 25th: The news of the People's Liberation Army's million-strong force successfully crossing the Yangtze River and the successive liberation of Nanjing, Taiyuan, and other places has stirred up waves of jubilation in the liberated areas. In the cities, citizens scrambled to read "special editions" and listen to the radio. In the countryside, members of children's corps stood on rooftops and used megaphones to loudly announce the good news, while peasants spread the word. Wherever the good news reached, cheers erupted. Millions of people expressed their determination to redouble their efforts to support the People's Liberation Army and accelerate the liberation of all of China. Workers at the Shenyang Railway Bridge Factory decided to rush-produce several machines and send them to the south of the Yangtze River before May 1st. The Rubber Factory of the Third Bureau of the Military Supplies Department originally planned to complete the task of producing 1.2 million pairs of rubber shoes by the end of May. Now, the workers have unanimously proposed to complete the task ten days ahead of schedule. The Jinan Railway Factory is rushing to repair the "Jiangnan" locomotive before May 1st and send it to the south of the Yangtze River. Workers in the factory's locomotive, machine, and boiler plants have voluntarily increased their daily working hours from nine to twelve hours. After hearing the news of the army crossing the river, workers at the Zhengzhou Public Iron Factory immediately implemented their May Day plan to increase night shifts that evening. Workers in the Telecommunications Bureau's engineering team, who were preparing to set off for work, said: "As soon as the army crosses the river, Wuhan will be liberated soon. After quickly erecting the wires from Luohe to Zhumadian, we will continue to erect them all the way to Hankou." After Yan'an received the news of the liberation of Nanjing and Taiyuan, the Masses Daily immediately printed a "special edition" and dispatched propaganda trucks. The citizens discussed: Taiyuan is setting an example for Xi'an. If the Kuomintang bandit army in Xi'an does not surrender, it will be eliminated like Taiyuan. The trade union, peasant association, youth league preparatory committee, and women's federation of the Subei Yancheng District called on all sectors to accelerate the completion of the task of supporting the front lines. The Henan Provincial Congress of the Communist Party of China, which is currently being held, sent a telegram congratulating the People's Liberation Army troops advancing south across the Yangtze River, saying: Your actions represent the great will of the people of the whole country to "carry the revolution through to the end" and are an effective sanction against the Kuomintang reactionaries' blatant rejection of the peace agreement. We, on behalf of the party, government, army, and people of Henan, extend our warm and high respects to you and are willing to do our utmost to support the southern expedition of the army and strive for the rapid arrival of the liberation of the whole country.

    【新华社北平二十五日电】人民解放军百万大军胜利渡过长江，南京、太原等地相继解放的消息在解放区各地掀起了一个紧接一个的欢腾。在城市里市民争读“号外”，听广播，在乡村里儿童团员站立屋顶用扬声筒大声宣读捷报，农民们奔走相告。捷报传到哪里，哪里就响起一片欢声。成千百万的人民表示将以加倍努力支援人民解放军，加速地解放全中国。沈阳铁路桥梁工厂工友决定在“五一”以前特别赶制几种机器送到江南去。军需部三局橡胶厂原定于五月底完成一百二十万双胶鞋的任务，现在工友一致提出要提前十天完成。济南铁路工厂赶于“五一”前把“江南号”机车修好送到江南去。该厂所属机车、机器、锅炉三个厂的工人自动将每天工作时间由九小时增加到十二小时。郑州市公营铁工厂工人听到大军渡江消息后，当晚就实行了“五一”增加夜工的计划。正准备出发工作的电讯局工程队工人说：“大军一过江，武汉就快解放啦，赶快架好漯河到驻马店的电线后，好一直架到汉口去。”延安接到南京、太原解放的消息后，群众日报社立即印发“号外”，并出动宣传卡车。市民们议论着：太原是给西安做样子的，西安国民党匪军不投降，就象太原一样消灭它。苏北盐阜区工会、农会、青年团各筹委会及妇联会号召各界，加紧完成支援前线任务。正在举行的中共河南省代表会议，电贺人民解放军渡江南进部队，里面说：你们的行动，代表了全国人民“把革命进行到底”的伟大意志，也是对国民党反动派悍然拒绝和平协定的有效制裁。我们谨代表河南党政军民向你们致热烈崇高的敬礼，并愿竭力支援大军南征，争取全国解放的迅速到来。
