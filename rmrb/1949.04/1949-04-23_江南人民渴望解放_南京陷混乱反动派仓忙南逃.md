Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains Front, 22nd: The people in various areas south of the Yangtze River are yearning for the People's Liberation Army to cross the river. According to peasants from Jiangxi, the Kuomintang bandit army is conscripting soldiers in the Pengze area, assigning as many as forty men to each bao (unit of collective security). At the same time, they are extorting heavy grain taxes, and the people are eagerly awaiting the PLA to rescue them. A worker from a spinning factory said, "The workers in Jiujiang are anxiously waiting for the PLA." Many industrialists and businessmen who understand the CCP's policies also hope that the PLA will arrive sooner rather than later. They can no longer endure the oppression and destruction of the Kuomintang reactionaries. They say, "It's better to cross the river sooner than later." A teacher from Suzhou wrote a letter to his friend in Huangmei, eastern Hubei, comforting him, saying, "The Liberation Army will surely advance south soon. During the Dragon Boat Festival in the fifth lunar month, we can safely drink realgar wine here." Furthermore, according to a Kuomintang soldier who fled from Jiujiang, the enemy troops along the river lack fighting spirit. The enemy troops guarding the south bank of Wangjiang in Anhui were so frightened by the sound of the PLA's artillery attacking Huayang Town on the north bank that they fled. Many lower-ranking officers believe that the so-called "river defense" is actually useless, and they are deserting in droves to return home.

Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, 22nd: Under the valiant advance of the People's Liberation Army, the Kuomintang reactionary government in Nanjing has fallen into complete chaos. Kuomintang reactionaries who refused to accept the peace agreement are scrambling to board planes to flee south. The pseudo-Central News Agency, which has consistently promoted war and opposed peace, has also ordered the Taipei branch to prepare to take over operations. However, the general public in Nanjing and the majority of civil servants in the Kuomintang government are displaying a different sentiment. They are calmly waiting for the arrival of the People's Liberation Army. Agence France-Presse, Nanjing, 19th: A dispatch said that the capital (referring to Nanjing) does not have any anxiety, and commercial activities are proceeding as usual. The people believe that the Communists' crossing of the river is inevitable, and except for a small number of officials, there are no signs of people fleeing the capital.

　　江南人民渴望解放
  　南京陷混乱反动派仓忙南逃
    【新华社中原前线二十二日电】长江南岸各地人民都渴望着解放军渡江。据从江西来的老百姓谈：国民党匪军在彭泽一带抓兵，每保派四十名之多，同时还勒索繁重的粮款，他们都望眼欲穿地盼望解放军去救他们。某纺纱工厂来的工人说：九江的工人都等解放军等得心焦了。许多了解中共政策的工商业者也希望解放军早点过去，他们再经不住国民党反动派的压榨摧残了，他们说：“早点过江比迟点好。”苏州一个教员写信安慰鄂东黄梅的他的朋友说：“解放大军必将在最近南进，旧历五月端阳佳节，我们这里可以安然喝雄黄酒了。”又据九江逃来的国民党军士兵说：沿江各地敌军士无斗志，安徽望江南岸守敌，听到北岸解放军攻打华阳镇的炮声就吓得跑了。许多下级军官都认为所谓“江防”，实际毫不顶事，纷纷开小差回家。
    【新华社北平二十二日电】在人民解放军的奋勇进军下，南京国民党反动政府已陷于完全的混乱。拒绝接受和平协定的国民党反动分子都在抢坐飞机南逃。一贯宣传战争反对和平的伪中央通讯社也已命令台北方面准备接替工作。但是南京一般市民和国民党政府中大多数公务人员却表现一种另外的情绪，他们都在安定地等待着解放军的到达。法新社南京十九日消息说：首都（指南京）没有任何焦虑情绪，商业活动在照常进行。老百姓都认为共产党的渡江是不可避免的，除了一小批官员外，首都没有任何外逃的迹象。
