　　The North China Trade Corporation Holds Manager Joint Conference
  　Organizes Urban-Rural Material Exchange
  　Develops Industrial and Agricultural Production
    [This Dispatch] After the North China Trade Corporation moved to Tianjin, based on the new situation after the liberation of Peiping and Tianjin, it convened the Third District, City, and Specialized Company Manager Joint Conference last month to discuss inland trade issues and determine new management policies for inland trade. It also arranged business plans for the entire region for the spring and summer seasons. The conference first discussed the characteristics of the current trade work, believing that: 1. It faces the task of supplying a large amount of concentrated necessities of life and production raw materials, and distributing a concentrated large amount of industrial products. Not only are the types of commodities managed more complex and expanded than before, but also the management methods must be transformed from simple agricultural seasonal and regional adjustments to a large-scale organization of the exchange of industrial and agricultural products. 2. In the market, we will encounter huge amounts of speculative capital. These speculative capitalists are constantly watching for opportunities to engage in speculative activities and undermine the national economy. Therefore, the task of combating speculation in our business activities is even more important. 3. Supply and marketing cooperatives have not yet been universally organized, and there is a lack of links between the state-owned economy and the small-scale production economy. Therefore, the purchase of agricultural products and the promotion of industrial products must be mainly carried out through legitimate private merchants at present. Due to more than ten years of war blockade and destruction of transportation, the old urban-rural material exchange relations have been disrupted, and new trade relations have not yet been formed, requiring us to explore and grasp them through business activities.
    The conference then put forward the future management policy: to vigorously organize urban-rural material exchange to develop industrial and agricultural production, and stabilize prices and develop the economy through the rational exchange of industrial and agricultural products and the strengthening of regional and seasonal adjustments. It is necessary to sufficiently supply cities and industrial areas with grain and industrial raw materials, supply disaster areas with grain, and distribute a large number of industrial products to the countryside in a timely manner.
    1. In terms of price policy, it is necessary to vigorously promote industrial products in exchange for industrial raw materials and grain. Under the principle that industrial production is profitable, trade companies should strive for small profits and quick sales and accelerate turnover when selling industrial products, so that industrial products can quickly flow into the countryside in exchange for grain, cotton, other industrial raw materials, and export goods to the city to stabilize urban and rural prices. In practice, it is necessary to strengthen regional and seasonal material adjustments in a more planned way, and regions must support each other. Regions with low prices must resolutely support regions with high prices. It is necessary to prevent the erroneous idea of hoarding and refusing to sell, pursuing high profits, hindering urban-rural exchange, and hindering production.
    It is necessary to earnestly support cooperatives, but it is also necessary to organize a large number of private businesses to serve the country.
    2. In the relationship with cooperatives, it is necessary to earnestly support cooperatives, supply means of production and means of living, and ensure good quality, cheap prices, and fair prices for purchasing cooperative products. Any business that cooperatives can handle must first be entrusted to cooperatives. However, since cooperative organizations are still just beginning, it is not yet possible to conduct trade mainly through cooperatives. It is still necessary to organize a large number of private businesses to serve the country. For example, in cities, in addition to going through cooperatives, grain and cloth should also be sold through a large number of retail stores to form a retail network to quickly meet the needs of citizens. When purchasing grain, industrial raw materials, and export goods, in addition to going through cooperatives, a large number of private processing factories and private warehouses should also be organized. Give them appropriate profits so that they can purchase materials for state trade agencies.
    3. It is necessary to resolutely and unhesitatingly fight against speculative capital that hoards, manipulates the market, fluctuates prices, and undermines production. The government's policy of protecting industry and commerce must also be resolutely implemented for legitimate industrial and commercial households. In the fight against investment, the conference proposed learning from the lessons of the Shijiazhuang price fluctuations last year and learning the strategies of anti-speculation struggles.
    4. In relation to urban industry, the conference decided that state-owned trade agencies must use great efforts to assist in the restoration of urban industry, first state-owned enterprises and then private enterprises. The conference decided that trade companies must guarantee the start of production at Zhongfang and strive to fully supply cotton.
    In order to adapt to the new situation and new working policies, the conference decided to partially reorganize trade institutions. The general company's business section is divided into fiber, coal and iron, general merchandise, grain and oil, and other departments to gradually specialize. The establishment of storage and transportation departments and transit stations to strengthen warehouse business and transportation work, the establishment of specialized companies such as Pingjin Coal and Iron Company and Changlu Salt Industry Company to operate special commodities. The conference also decided to focus on cities in the future, with Tianjin as the center, and for cities to lead the countryside. In the future, the company's funds will be further unified and dispatched, and the system of calculating the break-even point of each company, which promotes the purely profit-making viewpoint and promotes anarchic phenomena, will be abolished.
    The conference pointed out that all cadres must learn how to manage commerce and must improve their policy level. All business measures must start from policies and be conducive to the development of production. It is required that all comrades do not be arrogant and complacent, learn all the business knowledge of operating commerce in the city, learn to master the current massive material transfer, storage, and organization, and use modern transportation tools such as railways and ships. Learn to identify various scientific methods of commodities and learn how to meet industrial needs in the supply of raw materials. The conference formulated a new business plan. It was decided to focus on the operation of grain, cotton, export goods, and the promotion of urban industrial products as the main business, and to concentrate funds on the operation of these commodities.

　　华北贸总召开经理联席会
  　组织城乡物资交流
  　发展工业农业生产
    【本报讯】华北贸易总公司移津后，根据平津解放后的新形势，于上月召开了第三次区、市、专业公司经理联席会议，讨论内地贸易问题，决定了内地贸易新的经营方针。并布置了全区春夏两季的业务计划。大会首先讨论了当前贸易工作上的特点，认为：一、面临着大量的集中的生活必需品与生产原料的供给，和集中的大量的工业品的分配任务。不仅经营商品种类较前更为复杂，更为扩大，经营方法上也必须从单纯的农业季节性与地区性的调剂，转为大量的组织工农业产品的交流。二、在市场上我们将会遇到巨量的投机资本。这些投机资本家时时刻刻在窥伺空隙，进行投机活动，破坏国民经济。因此在我们的业务活动中反投机的任务是更加加重了。三、供销合作社还没有普遍组织起来，国营经济与小生产经济的密切联系还缺乏纽带，因此收购农产品与推销工业品，必须以通过正当私人商贩为目前的主要方式。由于十多年的战争封锁和交通的破坏，旧的城乡物资交流关系已被打乱，新的贸易关系尚未形成，需要我们从业务活动中去摸索掌握。
    会议继即提出今后的经营方针：要大力组织城乡物资交流，以发展工业农业生产，从工农业产品的合理交换与加强地区性季节性的调剂中稳定物价，发展经济。必须充足供给城市、工业区以粮食和工业原料，供给灾区粮食，并把大量的工业品及时分配到农村中去。
    一、在物价政策上，必须大量的推销工业品，以换取工业原料和粮食。在工业生产有利可图的原则下，贸易公司出售工业品，应力求薄利多销，加速周转，使工业品很快的流入农村，换取粮食、棉花及其他工业原料和出口物资进城，以平稳城乡物价。在作法上，必须较有计划的加强地区性与季节性物资调剂，各地区间必须相互支援。物价低的地区，必须坚决支持物价高的地区。必须防止囤积不卖，追求高利，妨害城乡交流，妨害生产的错误思想。
    要认真扶植合作社，但必须大量组织私人商业，使之为国家服务。
    二、在与合作社的关系上，要认真扶植合作社，供给生产资料与生活资料，要做到货物质量好，价钱便宜，收购合作社产品，一定要价格公道。凡属合作社能够办的业务，一定要首先委托合作社去办。但在目前合作社组织还刚在开始，因此还不能以通过合作社进行贸易为主要方式，还必须大量的组织私人商业，使私人商业为国家服务，例如在城市中出售粮布。除经过合作社外，还应大量的组织零售店，构成零售网，以迅速供应市民需要。在收购粮食、工业原料与出口物资时，除经过合作社外，还应大量的组织私人加工工厂，私人货栈。给以适当的利润，使他们替国家贸易机关收购物资。
    三、对待囤积居奇、操纵市场、波动物价、破坏生产的投机资本，要坚决地、毫不犹豫地进行斗争。对正当的工商业户，也必须坚决执行政府的保护工商业政策。在对投资的斗争上，大会提出接受去年石家庄物价波动的教训，学会反投机斗争的策略。
    四、在与城市工业的关系上，大会决定国营贸易机关必须用大力来协助恢复城市工业，首先是国营企业，其次是私营企业。大会决定贸易公司必须保证中纺开工，力求充分的供给棉花。
    为了适应新的情况和新的工作方针。会议决定局部的改组贸易机构，总公司业务部分为纤维、煤铁、百货、粮油等部，以求逐渐专业化。设立储运部与转运总站，以加强仓库业务与运输工作，设立了平津煤铁公司、长芦盐业公司等专业公司，以经营特种商品。大会并决定了今后把经营重点放在城市，以天津为中心，以城市领导乡村。今后全公司资金进一步统一调度，取消促进单纯盈利观点，助长无政府现象的各公司计算保本的制度。
    大会指出了全体干部必须学习经营商业，必须提高政策水平。一切业务措施必须从政策出发，从对发展生产有利出发。要求全体同志不要自骄自满，学会在城市经营商业的一切业务知识，学会掌握当前庞大物资的调运保管和组织使用铁路轮船等近代交通工具。学会鉴别商品的各种科学方法，学会在供给原料上如何适合工业需要。大会制订了新的业务计划。决定以经营粮食、棉花和出口物资及推销城市工业品为主要业务，并把资金集中使用于这些商品的经营方面。
