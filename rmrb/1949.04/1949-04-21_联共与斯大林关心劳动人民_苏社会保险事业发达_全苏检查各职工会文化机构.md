Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 19th: "The Soviet social insurance undertaking is the most progressive in the world. The care of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and Stalin for the working people is also vividly manifested in the social insurance undertaking." This was pointed out by Soloviev, Secretary of the Central Committee of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions, in an article published in Labor News. Soloviev wrote: The social insurance undertaking enables workers to enjoy the rights of recuperation, treatment, and support when they are old or lose their ability to work due to some accident. The total amount of state funding for social insurance increases year by year. It was 10.4 billion rubles during the First Five-Year Plan, and has already been 62 billion rubles since the implementation of the post-war Five-Year Plan. The budget for social insurance in 1949 reached 17.491 billion rubles.

Soloviev said: In 1933, the Bolshevik Party and the Soviet government authorized trade unions to manage social insurance, thus making trade unions closer to the working masses and ensuring that the working masses can widely control the social insurance fund and use it correctly and rationally. Every enterprise, factory, manufacturing plant, and local trade union committee with more than 100 workers has established a social insurance fund committee to deal with some important issues. These committees send workers to sanatoriums and health resorts for recuperation, and establish children's camps for workers' children. At present, there are more than 1.2 million social insurance representatives and factory social insurance committee members in various enterprises and agencies.

The working people of the Soviet Union have a dense network of medical institutions, sanatoriums, and health resorts. Before the war, in 1940, trade unions had 893 sanatoriums, epidemic prevention stations, and health resorts, and after the war, in 1948, the number had reached 1,117. Last year, nearly 1.8 million workers received national social insurance funds to spend their holidays. And this year, the number of people accommodated in sanatoriums and health resorts will increase to more than 2 million. Not only that, workers and others will also organize thousands of workers to camp and hike to spend their holidays. At the same time, the families and children of workers will recuperate in public health institutions and various health departments. The state also allocates the largest social insurance fund to organize entertainment activities for children.

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 19th: Moscow News: According to the resolution of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions, the Soviet Union has begun to inspect the cultural institutions of trade unions nationwide from the 15th.

In the coal mining industry alone, the All-Union Miners' Union owns more than 600 clubs and palaces of culture, more than 600 libraries, and 2,389 reading rooms, serving workers, engineers, staff, and their families. Tens of thousands of miners, staff, and their families participate in various amateur art activities in these clubs and palaces of culture. Excellent movies are shown in the clubs. The number of miners' libraries has exceeded 600, with a total of 1.25 million books. They are still being continuously expanded, and 243 libraries are scheduled to open before the end of this year, and 8 million rubles have been allocated to purchase books. The Central Committee of the Coal Mining Industry Trade Union and the Coal Mining Industry have recently begun to jointly build new clubs and palaces of culture. There are currently 118 clubs under construction. In the coal mining areas of Voroshilovgrad and Stalino Oblast, in the Urals and the Far East, new cultural institutions are increasing. The miners of Stalino Oblast will also install new and beautiful equipment in the Palace of Culture.

  　苏社会保险事业发达
    全苏检查各职工会文化机构
    【新华社北平十九日电】“苏联社会保险事业是全世界最进步的。苏联共产党和斯大林对劳动人民的关心，也生动地表现在社会保险事业上”。这是全苏职工会中央委员会书记索洛维耶夫在劳动报上发表的文章里指出的，索氏写道：社会保险事业使职工在老年或因某种意外以致失去工作能力的时候，有享受休养、治疗及赡养等权利。国家对社会保险事业拨款的总额一年比一年增加，第一个五年计划期间是一百零四亿卢布，而实行战后五年计划以来，就已经拨了六百二十亿卢布。一九四九年社会保险的预算达一百七十四亿九千一百万卢布。
    索氏说：一九三三年，布尔什维克党及苏联政府授权职工会，来管理社会保险，使职工会因而更加接近职工群众，并保证劳动群众得以广泛地控制社会保险基金，正确而合理的运用。每一个有一百名工人以上的企业、工厂、制造厂及各地职工会委员会，都设立了社会保险基金委员会，来处理一些重要问题。这些委员会送职工们到休养所和疗养院去疗养，并给职工的孩子们建立儿童营。目前在各企业和各机关中，共有一百二十余万社会保险代表和工厂社会保险委员会委员。
    在苏联劳动人民有着密如蛛网的医疗机关，疗养院和休养所。在战前一九四○年，职工会有八百九十三所疗养院、防疫站和休养所，而战后，在一九四八年，数目已达到了一千一百十七所。去年将近有一百八十万职工，得到国家社会保险金，渡过他们的假期。而今年，疗养院和休养所收容的人数将增加到二百多万人。不仅如此，职工等还要组织数千职工登山宿营和徒步旅行，以消度他们的假期。同时，职工的家属和子女将在公共卫生机构和各个卫生部门疗养。国家并拨付大最的社会保险基金来组织儿童们的娱乐活动。
    【新华社北平十九日电】莫斯科讯：依照全苏联工会中央委员会的决议，苏联全国已从十五日开始检查各职工会的文化机构。
    仅仅在煤矿工业中，全苏矿工的职工会就拥有六百多所俱乐部和文化之宫，六百多所图书馆及二千三百八十九个阅览室，为工人、工程师、职员和他们的家属服务。成万的矿工、职员和他们的家属，都参加这些俱乐部和文化之宫的各种业余艺术活动。俱乐部里放映着优美的电影。矿工图书馆数目已超过了六百所，共拥有一百二十五万册图书，现在还在不断的扩充，还有二百四十三所图书馆，定于今年年底以前开放，并且拨了八百万卢布用来添置图书。煤矿业职工会中委会与煤矿工业近又开始共同建造新的俱乐部和文化之宫。现在正有一百一十八所俱乐部在建造中。在伏罗希洛夫格勒和斯大林诺州，在乌拉尔和远东等煤矿区，新的文化机构都正在增加。斯大林诺州的矿工们还要在文化之宫里装设新式的漂亮的设备。
