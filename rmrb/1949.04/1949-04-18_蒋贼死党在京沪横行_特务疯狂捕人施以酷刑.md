Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 17th: According to news from Nanjing: Chiang Kai-shek's diehards are still running amok in the Nanjing and Shanghai areas. The war criminal Tang Enbo's puppet Nanjing-Shanghai-Hangzhou Garrison Headquarters arrested Xu Wentian, a member of the Kuomintang Legislative Yuan, on the 10th in Nanjing on the charge of so-called "plotting to incite the army and plotting wrongdoing." Jin Shaoxian, another member of the Kuomintang Legislative Yuan, was also arrested at the same time. Jin was released on the same day, while Xu was detained in Shanghai before being returned to Nanjing after protests from the Kuomintang Legislative Yuan. Jin disclosed to the press: When he was detained at the Nanjing Garrison Headquarters, he heard and saw people (including students) detained there being subjected to cruel torture such as waterboarding and tiger benches by special agents. Jin said, "Now I know how cruel these special agents are," "Now I see who the murderers of Chinese democracy are." Zhang Jiuru, another member of the Kuomintang Legislative Yuan, also confirmed during questioning at a meeting of the puppet Legislative Yuan that Kuomintang special agents were frantically arresting people. He said, "I have received calls from various parties in Shanghai, and I know that more than just Committee Member Xu has been arrested, and many people have been arrested without authorization in various places."

  　特务疯狂捕人施以酷刑
    【新华社北平十七日电】据南京消息：蒋介石死党仍在京沪地区恣意横行。战犯汤恩伯的伪京沪杭警备司令部又于十日在南京将国民党立法委员许闻天逮捕，罪名是所谓“策动军队，图谋不轨”。另一国民党立法委员金绍先亦同时被捕。金当天释放，许则被押往上海经国民党立法院抗议后才放回南京。金向新闻界披露：他被押在南京卫戍司令部时，曾听到和看到被押在那里的人（包括学生）被特务施以灌水、老虎凳一类的残酷刑法的情景。金说：“我现在知道了这些特务有多么残酷”，“现在我看到了中国民主的杀害者究竟是谁”。另一国民党立法委员张九如在伪立法院会上质询时亦证实国民党特务正在疯狂捕人。他说：“在沪接各方电话，知道被捕的不止许委员一人，各地擅自逮捕的人亦很多。”
