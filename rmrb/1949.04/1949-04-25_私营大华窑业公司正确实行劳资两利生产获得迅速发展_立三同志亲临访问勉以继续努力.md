　　Private Dahua Pottery Company Correctly Implements Labor-Capital Collaboration, Achieving Rapid Development
    Li Lisan Visits and Encourages Continued Efforts
    [Our Newspaper News] Our newspaper reporter Ai Fang reports: During the symposiums held by the CCP Beijing Municipal Committee for both private factory worker representatives and capitalists, it was discovered that Dahua Pottery Company in the city has rapidly restored and developed production since the liberation of Beijing, thanks to the implementation of a labor-capital collaboration policy. Workers' living standards have also improved considerably, and labor-capital relations are quite harmonious. In order to gain an in-depth understanding of the company's situation, Comrade Li Lisan of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions made a special visit on the 23rd, engaging in separate discussions with the factory manager, engineers, and worker representatives. He broadly exchanged views on issues such as factory management, labor-capital relations, wages, and education. Manager Chen Yintang, Engineer Wang, and worker representative Liu Chaoqin first introduced the company's recovery process. According to them, before the liberation of Beijing, Manager Chen had heard of the policies of the Chinese Communist Party. After the liberation, he invested the money from selling a house into the factory. With the active efforts of all employees, the factory officially resumed work on February 4th. In March, they produced five kiln loads of goods, and in April, they expect to produce eight kiln loads. In May, they plan to produce ten kiln loads, and in the second half of the year, they plan to produce at least fifteen kiln loads, ideally seventeen kiln loads per month. Last year, the total output for nine months was only twenty kiln loads. During the Kuomintang rule, the factory's business suffered heavy losses. Since the resumption of work in February, its production income has covered all factory expenses and paid the living allowance (2,000 yuan per person) for employees who stayed in the factory and guarded it during the shutdown due to the war. If eight kiln loads are produced in April, it can earn 200,000 to 300,000 yuan. What are the main reasons for the company's success? When Manager Chen answered Comrade Li Lisan's question, he summarized the answer as follows: Because the factory management problem was solved relatively reasonably, and employees' lives were properly taken care of, employees' enthusiasm for production increased. After the liberation of Beijing, the first reform in the factory was the establishment of a factory management committee. The director of the committee is the factory director, under which there are eight groups: auditing (auditing accounts), inspection (inspecting the quality of products), technology, sales, business, welfare, and learning. Among the nineteen committee members, seven are worker representatives. The worker representatives report every resolution of the factory committee to the workers and reflect the workers' opinions to the next meeting of the factory management committee. The factory management committee solves all production and labor welfare issues within the factory, appropriately adopting the workers' opinions. This is a relatively democratic and scientific management mechanism. Through it, workers understand the major events within the factory, business operations, income and expenditure, profit and loss, and even the entire process from purchasing raw materials to production and sales of finished products, inspiring workers to take common responsibility for production. Through it, labor-capital relations can be reasonably resolved. Since the liberation of Beijing, the company has never had any labor-capital disputes. The second reform is economic transparency and improved living standards for workers. According to worker representatives, before liberation, the general wage was only enough to buy socks and shoes in addition to food. Some people did not have enough to eat after being sick for a few days. Now, in addition to the factory providing food, the minimum daily wage is three and a half catties of rice, and the maximum is five and a half catties of rice. The engineer receives 500 catties of rice per month. Manager Chen receives 250 catties of rice per month. Calculated according to the minimum wage, the monthly income, including food, can reach about 160 catties, which can maintain the minimum life of two people. Comrade Li Lisan pointed out that this wage standard is almost the same as the labor regulations, but the level difference is smaller. For example, the minimum wage for workers (excluding food and accommodation) is about 100 catties, and the maximum wage is only about 150 catties. The difference in the middle is too small, and the manager's 250 catties of rice is also too little. Comrade Li Lisan explained that the wage policy of New Democracy is based on "payment according to work." He said that under the current conditions, wages should not be set too high; capital should be accumulated for construction and expanded production. Of course, it should not be too low either; if it is too low, it will affect employees' ability to maintain their lives, which will also affect production. According to the workers' representatives, because everyone understands that the factory has just resumed work and is not currently making money, they voluntarily set the wages not high. The manager's salary was originally rated as 500 catties, the same as the engineer, but he voluntarily reduced it. Currently, the salary evaluation committee is discussing adjustments and has drafted a new plan. The third reform is the gradual establishment of worker welfare services and the development of employee cultural and entertainment activities. The factory has now established a barber shop, improved the canteen and diet, and a bathhouse is also planned. It has also established a ball field, music group, wall newspaper group, and organized a team. When Manager Chen talked about employee welfare, he said, "People are still people," and they should live a material and cultural life. Employees are very enthusiastic about learning, and the factory management committee is also paying attention to leadership. However, there is still much work to be done in this area, such as the establishment of employee cooperatives and subsidies for employee medical treatment. The employees’ enthusiasm and the establishment of new labor attitudes are caused by these specific reforms. This point was also fully explained in the discussion with worker representatives: For example, a worker named Yang said, "Working in industry is like living life. Now wages cannot be very high. If they are too high, the factory will close down, and we will lose our jobs." Another worker said, "Now our lives are much better than before liberation, so we are all willing to work. Not only has the number of products increased, but the quality has also improved. In the past, Dahua products could not be sold. Now Tianjin and other places are coming to order goods and are willing to pay a deposit first." Comrade Li Lisan finished talking with the labor and capital sides, and visited the machine, blank making, and kiln factories to inquire in detail about the production situation and the lives of the workers. Before leaving, Comrade Li Lisan said to Manager Chen: "You are an entrepreneur. If you continue to work hard according to the current spirit, you will surely make many achievements in the cause of developing China's industry."
    Note: Mr. Chen Yintang, manager of Dahua Pottery Company in this city, is a graduate of a former Japanese higher industrial school. After returning to China, he has been working in the industry for 30 years. He once co-founded Zaoxing Pottery Company in Shenyang with democrat Mr. Du Chongyuan, and also ran Dongxing Textile Factory, etc. Dahua Pottery Company was founded by Manager Chen and has a history of seven years.

　　私营大华窑业公司正确实行劳资两利生产获得迅速发展
    立三同志亲临访问勉以继续努力
    【本报讯】本报记者艾方报导：在中共北平市委所召开的私营工厂职工代表座谈会，以及资本家座谈会上，发现本市大华窑业公司由于实行了劳资两利的政策，在平市解放后，迅速恢复并发展了生产，工人生活也相当改善了，劳资关系也很协调。全国总工会李立三同志为了深入了解该公司的情况，特于日前（二十三）前往访问，先后与该厂经理、工程师及职工代表分别座谈，就工厂管理、劳资关系、工资、学习诸问题，广泛交换意见。该厂经理陈荫棠、王工程师及职工代表刘潮钦，首先介绍该厂恢复生产的经过。据称：北平解放前，陈经理就听到过中国共产党的政策，北平解放后，他把以前卖了一所住宅的钱，投资工厂，在全体职工的积极努力下，该厂遂于二月四日正式复工。三月份出了五窑货，四月份可望八窑，五月份计划出十窑，下半年每月预定出到十七窑，至少出十五窑。在去年，九个月的总产量也只二十窑。国民党统治时期，该厂营业是赔本很厉害的，自二月份复工以后，其生产收入除供工厂一切开支外，并发了因战争停工住厂职工的看管费（每人两千元）。四月份如果出到八窑，即可获得二、三十万。该公司能以获致这种成绩的主要原因是什么呢？在陈经理回答立三同志的问题时，总结出这样的答案：由于工厂管理问题比较合理的解决了，职工生活得到了适当的照顾，所以职工的生产积极性提高了。北平解放后，该厂第一个改革是建立厂务管理委员会，主任委员是厂长，下设审核（审核账目）、检查（检查制品好坏）、技术、推销、营业、福利、学习等八个小组，在十九个委员中，有七个工人代表参加。每次厂务委员会的决议，工人代表都向工人报告，并将工人意见，反映到下一次的厂务管理委员会的会议中。厂务管理委员会解决厂内的一切生产、劳工福利等问题，都适当的采纳了工人的意见。这是个比较民主科学的管理机构。通过它，工人们了解了厂内的大事，业务经营，收支状况，盈亏情况，以至自购买原料，生产至推销成品的整个过程，启发了工人对生产共同负责的观念，通过它，使得劳资关系得以合理解决。自平市解放迄今，该公司从未发生过劳资纠纷。第二个改革是经济公开，工人生活改善，据工人代表谈，解放前一般的工资，除吃饭外，只够穿袜子鞋的，有的生了几天病，就不够吃。现在除由厂方供给食突外，每天工资最少的是三斤半米，最多的是五斤半米。工程师是每月五百斤米。陈经理是每月二百五十斤米。按最低的工资计算，每月连吃在内能收入一百六十斤左右，可维持两口人的起码生活。立三同志指出这个工资标准与劳大规定还差不多，只是等级差额小些，如工人最低工资（食宿除外）一百斤左右。最高工资也只有一百五十斤左右。中间差额太小，经理二百五十斤米，也太少了。立三同志讲明新民主主义的工资政策是按劳付酬。他说在现有条件下，工资不能订的太高；应当积累资本，从事建设，扩大生产。当然，也不能太低；太低了，影响职工不能维持生活，也就会影响生产。据工人代表的反映。由于经济公开，大家了解到了工厂刚刚复工不入，目前不赚钱，因此自动把工资订的不高，经理的工资原评定为五百斤，与工程师同，但本人自动缩减，目前评议工资委员会正讨论加以调整，已拟定新的方案，第三个改革，是工人福利事业的逐渐建立、职工文化娱乐工作的开展。该厂现已建立了理发室，改进了食堂和饮食，澡塘也在计划建设中。还建立了球场，音乐组、壁报组，组织了球队。陈经理谈到工人福利事业时说：“人总是人”，应该过物质的文化的生活。职工学习情绪很高，厂务管理委员会在领导上也很注意。不过，在这一方面，尚有许多工作要做，如职工合作社的举办，职工疾病治疗的补助等。职工积极性的发挥，新的劳动态度的树立，是通过这些具体改革而引起的。这一点，与工人代表的座谈中，也充分得到了说明：如姓杨的工友谈，“干工业像过日子一样。现在工资不能很高，太高了，工厂倒闭了，还会失业呢？”另一个工友说，现在我们工人生活比解放前好多了，所以我们大家都乐意干，不仅产品数增多了，而且质量也改好了。以前大华产品推销不出去，现在天津等处都来订货并愿先交几成钱。立三同志与劳资双方交谈完毕，并至机器、制坯、大窑各厂参观，对生产情况，工人生活，一一询问甚详。立三同志临行，对陈经理说：“你是个事业家，今后按照现在精神继续努力，在发展中国工业的事业上一定会有很多建树的。”
    按：本市大华窑业公司经理陈荫棠先生，为日本前高等工业学校毕业学生，回国后即在产业界任职，至今已三十年，曾与民主人士杜重远先生在沈阳合办造兴窑业公司，并办过东兴纺织工厂等，大华窑业公司为陈经理所手创，至今已有七年的历史。
