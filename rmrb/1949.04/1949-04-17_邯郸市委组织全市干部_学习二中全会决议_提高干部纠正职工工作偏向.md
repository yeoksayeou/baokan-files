　　Handan Municipal Party Committee Organizes City-Wide Cadre
    Study of the Second Plenary Session Resolution
  　Improve Cadre Correction of Worker Work Deviations

    [Reported by this newspaper] After studying the Resolution of the Second Plenary Session of the Central Committee, this newspaper's March 17th editorial "Transforming Consumer Cities into Production Cities," and the Northeast Bureau's instructions on strengthening political and cultural education for the worker masses, the Handan Municipal Party Committee, in conjunction with the city's current work and the ideological issues of cadres, believes that a systematic study must be launched. It was decided to organize a study centered on "The Whole Party Develops Worker Work, Restores and Develops Industrial Production" from April 4th to 11th, involving over 450 cadres from the Party, government, trade unions, women's federations, and industrial and commercial enterprises, in order to improve cadres and promote work. The Municipal Party Committee first made a report: the Central Committee and the North China Bureau have pointed out in the above three documents the issues of who the urban work relies on, who to unite, and the restoration and development of industrial production. These are still new topics for Handan, which has been liberated for nearly four years, because currently our comrades still feel out of touch with the workers. First of all, the Municipal Party Committee does not pay enough attention to the leadership of worker work. The municipal government has, for a long time, been "managing when they come but not asking if they don't" regarding the democratic rights and welfare of workers. For example, in private factories such as Jiuda and Yumin, illegal infringements on workers' interests have not been dealt with promptly by the government. In state-owned and publicly-owned factories and shops, some units do not seriously establish factory management committees and trade unions, considering trade unions as troublesome, and are unwilling to use the 2.5% insurance premium and 1.5% cultural education fund stipulated by the Labor Congress resolution to carry out worker welfare programs. This is because some responsible comrades are still superstitious about individual, purely administrative leadership. Under the guidance of this kind of thinking, they have deprived workers of their democratic rights, extremely neglected the improvement of workers' culture, politics, and technology, and therefore cannot give play to the workers' enthusiasm for production, causing the restoration and development of production to lose its reliance. Finally, the Municipal Party Committee called on everyone to seriously study the documents, relate them to their own work and thinking, and seek improvement. (You Min)

　　邯郸市委组织全市干部
    学习二中全会决议
  　提高干部纠正职工工作偏向
    【本报讯】邯郸市委研究了二届中央全会决议和本报三月十七日社论“把消费城市变为生产城市”及东北局关于加强工人群众政治文化教育工作的指示等文件之后，联系该市目前工作与干部思想问题，认为必须展开有系统的学习。确定从四月四日至十一日以“全党开展职工工作，恢复发展工业生产”为中心内容，组织全体党、政、职工、妇联、工商各企业干部四百五十余人的学习，借以提高干部，推动工作。首由市委作报告：中央、华北局在以上三个文件中，提示了城市工作依靠谁团结谁，以及恢复发展工业生产等问题，对我们解放了近四年的邯郸来说，仍是新题目，因为在目前我们同志对职工仍感格格不入。首先市委对于职工工作的领导就不够重视，市政府对工人的民主权利与福利事业，长时期是“找来就管不来不问”，如久大、裕民等私营工厂，非法侵犯工人利益，政府未迅速处理。在国营公营工厂商店中，有好些单位不认真建立工厂管理委员会与职工会，认为职工会是麻烦，不愿按照劳大的决议抽百分之二点五的保险金，百分之一点五的文化教育基金拿来举办工人福利事业，这是因为某些负责同志，还在迷信个人的单纯行政领导，他们在这种思想指导下，剥夺了职工的民主权利，极端忽视工人文化政治技术的提高，因而也不能发挥职工的生产积极性，使恢复与发展生产失去依靠。最后市委号召大家认真学习文件，联系自己的工作与思想，求得提高。（幼民）
