[Ping City News] The news of the Shanghai reactionary authorities arresting students and massacring citizens reached Beiping. The Beiping Student Union and the Preparatory Committee of the Beiping Democratic Women's Federation issued a joint declaration yesterday (29th), stating:

　　Just as all peace-loving and democratic people are cheering for the victory of the liberation of Nanjing and Taiyuan, the atrocities of the Shanghai Kuomintang reactionary authorities in massacring two citizens and arresting hundreds of students have come to light. This is the death throes of the war criminals, which precisely shows that they have cut themselves off from the people, and they will not escape the judgment of the people!

　　The declaration hopes that the People's Liberation Army will continue to advance, saying: We, the students and women of Beiping, are determined to support you in continuing to advance bravely! Liberate Shanghai! Liberate all of China!

[Beiping Xinhua Broadcasting Station, 29th Message] The Preparatory Committee of the Beiping Democratic Women's Federation and the Beiping Student Union jointly issued a declaration protesting the British imperialist warships' armed interference in China's internal affairs, demanding: "British armed forces immediately withdraw from China, and the British government must punish the murderers and compensate and apologize to the Chinese People's Liberation Army." The declaration concluded: "The heroic people and all peace-loving people in the world will certainly stand with the Chinese people and fight to the end against any imperialist aggression and to defend world democracy and peace."

    正当所有爱好和平民主的人民为南京太原解放的胜利而欢呼的时候，传来了上海国民党反动当局屠杀两个市民和逮捕数百个同学的暴行。这是战犯们垂死前的挣扎，正表示他们自绝于人民，他们将逃脱不了人民的审判！
