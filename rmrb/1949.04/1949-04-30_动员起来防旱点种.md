Mobilize to Prevent Drought and Plant Seeds

The planting season has arrived, but rainfall is scarce in the vast areas of North China, and drought is developing, making planting extremely difficult. Drought resistance and disaster prevention, and ensuring timely planting have become the most urgent tasks in current rural work. To this end, the North China People's Government has issued an emergency notice (see page 2 of this newspaper on the 28th), calling on all levels of government in North China to urgently mobilize and implement drought prevention measures. In this regard, Ba County, Qing County, Hejian and other places in the Jizhong District have set an example for us. The experience of the sixth district of Hejian tells us that after they persuaded farmers to recognize the number of economic crops to be planted and helped them prepare seeds, some cadres were satisfied with their achievements, while ignoring the more important task of specifically organizing the masses to prevent drought and plant seeds. Some cadres, like the farmers, had a fluke mentality of relying on the heavens for food and were unwilling to dig wells, carry water, or plant seeds, passively waiting for rain. Only after breaking these ideological obstacles could the mass movement of well-digging and seed-planting be launched. The experiences of Ba County, Hejian and other places tell us that all rural party members must be mobilized to lead the farmers in fighting the drought. For more than ten years, the Party in rural North China has led the masses to overcome many droughts. When party members set an example, the masses will follow suit. Examples are the most effective method of persuasion for farmers. Countless experiences tell us that when farmers are blinded by backward, conservative, and even superstitious ideas, cadres and party members must persistently and patiently persuade them, without the slightest hesitation or wavering. Time is of the essence, and the task is urgent. Party and government leading organs at all levels should immediately take action and go all out to organize the masses to carry out shock drought prevention and planting. As long as we wholeheartedly lead the farmers and are good at applying our experience, we will surely win the support of the masses and achieve victory in drought prevention and planting.

　　动员起来防旱点种
    播种季节已到，但华北广大地区雨水缺少，旱象将成，播种已遭遇极大困难。抗旱防灾，保证按时播种已成为当前农村工作中最紧急的任务。为此华北人民政府特发出紧急通知（见二十八日本报二版），号召全华北各级政府紧急动员实行防旱措施。在这方面，冀中区霸县、青县、河间等地已给我们做出了榜样，河间六区的经验告诉我们：当他们说服农民认种的经济作物的数目，并帮助农民准备了种籽之后，于是有些干部就满足于自己的成绩，而忽视了更为重要的去具体组织群众防旱点种，有的干部与农民一样存在着靠天吃饭的侥幸心理，不愿意打井、挑水、点种，消极的等待着下雨。打破了这些思想障碍之后，群众打井、点种运动才得开展。霸县、河间等地的经验告诉我们：必须将全体农村党员动员起来，带领农民与旱灾进行斗争。十余年来我华北农村党曾带领群众克服了多次旱灾，当党员做出榜样之后，群众也就跟着行动起来。实例对农民是最有效的说服方法。无数次的经验告诉我们：在农民的落后、保守甚至迷信的观念所蒙蔽时，干部、党员要坚持地耐心地去说服农民，而不能有丝毫的动摇犹疑。时间是刻不容缓的，任务是迫切紧急的，各地党、政领导机关，应立即行动起来，全力以赴，去组织群众突击防旱播种。只要我们全心全意的领导农民，而又善于运用我们的经验，就一定会取得群众的拥护，取得防旱播种的胜利。
