How 察 Province Prevents Rinderpest

　　Our reporter Lü Guangming

　　In January of this year, rinderpest broke out in Duolun, 察北. Initially, the symptoms included shivering, swollen and rotten tongue, inflamed throat, and refusal to eat or drink. Subsequently, the cattle would vomit yellow fluid, develop severe diarrhea with a foul odor, cough, bleed from the nostrils, and stop ruminating. Upon death, the lungs would be ulcerated and extremely foul-smelling, the liver hardened, the gallbladder enlarged, and the small intestine filled with blood. Severe cases resulted in death within three to four days. The disease initially spread from the Mongolian grasslands to Duolun and then quickly spread westward to counties such as Chongli and southward to northern 平. Over the past three months, the epidemic area has spread to seven counties including Kangbao in the 察北 Special District and four counties including Chicheng, Longguan, Sihai, and Huairou in the冀察 Special District, totaling eleven counties and the Taibus Banner of Inner Mongolia. Duolun and Baoyuan were the most severely affected. According to a survey of seven villages including Tuchengkou in Duolun, out of 3,000 cattle, 1,000 died. By February 15, 2,800 cattle had died in Duolun County alone. In the two special districts mentioned above, according to incomplete statistics, the number of dead cattle reached more than 4,199, and including the recent death statistics from various counties, the number should be more than 5,000. In addition, of the approximately 5,000 head of cattle supplied by state-owned, publicly-owned commercial departments and supply and marketing cooperatives to various places, 950 died en route. Local people remember that during the rule of the puppet Mengjiang government, there was a major cattle plague that killed more than half of all the cattle. At that time, the enemy and puppet government took the opportunity to extract large quantities of good cattle blood and make a fortune from the cattle plague. Therefore, the masses are extremely terrified of this outbreak of rinderpest, and some of them initially held a skeptical and wait-and-see attitude towards our preventive inoculations.

　　This outbreak of rinderpest was still in its infancy at the end of last year. The Duolun County government reported to the 察北 Special Commissioner's Office, which immediately issued some folk remedies for treating the plague. On February 10, when the situation became more serious, the 察北 Prefectural Committee reported to the provincial government by telephone. The provincial government subsequently issued four emergency instructions, stating that rescuing cattle must be regarded as the most important task at present. At that time, veterinary epidemic prevention committees were immediately established from the special commissioner's office to the villages, and a large number of cadres were dispatched to the villages to carry out mass prevention and control campaigns. Under the correct principle of "prevention is more important than treatment," the first step was to establish blockades and checkpoints around the epidemic area to implement isolation. Cattle markets were immediately dissolved and transportation was stopped. Cattle were strictly prohibited from entering or leaving the rinderpest danger zone until the state of emergency was lifted. At the same time, the provincial government reported to the North China People's Government. Seventy-three doctors were dispatched from the 察蒙 Animal Husbandry Farm, the Livestock School, and the Beiping Military Equine Epidemic Prevention Office of the North China Military Region, along with forty-two students from the 察蒙 Animal Husbandry School. Together with cadres from the province and special district, they formed four medical teams and rushed to the disaster areas in 察北 and 冀察 by car.

　　During the work process, under the unified leadership of the Party, close cooperation between the Party, government, military, and people and the medical team fully demonstrated the spirit of serving the people. Medical workers from the newly liberated cities went deep into the countryside for the first time, braving the severe cold of the frontier, working from dawn to dusk, and were in high spirits. However, due to the excessive size of the epidemic area, it was inevitable that some areas were neglected. For this reason, the provincial government specially requested assistance from the Northeast Administrative Committee through the North China People's Government. The committee immediately dispatched a medical team of thirty-one people, carrying 160,000 cc of anti-plague serum, together with 400,000 cc of rabbit-derived vaccine cultivated by the North China Beiping Epidemic Prevention Office and a large number of pharmaceutical materials, and compressed from the outer lines to the inner lines by different routes, in order to stop the outward spread and ultimately achieve complete eradication. In 察北, the epidemic area was first delineated, with Baoyuan as the focus and Zhangbei Dahulun as the starting point for prevention and control, and the prevention and control work was developed from the starting point to the northwest and northeast sides. Stations were set up on all major transportation routes to isolate cattle carts and cattle herds from entering and exiting. By March 6, the inoculation work including Zhangbei, Baoyuan, Kangbao, and nine districts and seventy-two villages in Zuoqi had been fully launched. According to statistics on March 10, more than 10,000 cattle had been inoculated in the 察北 Special District, and more than 300 cattle had been cured. The rinderpest situation in 察北 had improved.

　　After rinderpest was discovered in Chicheng in the 冀察 District, the county immediately reported to the provincial government and organized traditional Chinese medicine to treat it with local methods. At the same time, a large number of cadres were transferred to the countryside for inspection. Although the results were not significant at that time, it laid the foundation for prevention and control. The rapid eradication of rinderpest in the county was closely related to this. After the medical team arrived, the county quickly set up seventy blockades on the periphery and forty-four checkpoints in the inland. The industrial assistant and director of the Joint Cooperative in each district were withdrawn to be specifically responsible for leading the militia to isolate cattle herds and implement martial law inspections (referring to the prohibition of cattle carts and cattle from entering and exiting). Party members in each village also guaranteed to implement various defense measures, so when the preventive inoculation was carried out, many villages made it so that the cattle were waiting for the people. The medical team that went to the county, including escorts and some local cadres who cooperated in the work, mostly learned the inoculation technique. By March 6, after twenty days of hard work, they finally completed the inoculation task for more than 5,600 cattle, accounting for about 70% of the total number of cattle in the county, and the rinderpest was eradicated. On March 7, the team transferred to Sihai and Huairou counties to carry out prevention and control work. By March 20, it had basically completed the prevention and eradication work in the 冀察 Special District.

　　According to the county's experience, defense should be the main focus, that is, isolation and inoculation should be given equal importance. In-depth and appropriate publicity and explanation work should also be carried out. First of all, we should break the masses' superstitious ideas of "natural life" and "fate," and explain that rinderpest is transmitted, and only strict prevention can avoid it. For the masses in the new district, we should also explain that the People's Government is fundamentally different from the enemy, puppets, and Kuomintang reactionary governments, in order to eliminate concerns about being unable to use the cattle immediately after being inoculated, being afraid of damaging pregnant cows, being afraid of having cattle blood drawn, and being afraid of being charged fees. After the publicity, the masses eliminated their suspicions and competed to welcome and invite the medical team, or traveled long distances to take their cattle for treatment. In this process of preventing and controlling rinderpest, the county truly achieved a close combination of publicity, organization, and technology, so the rinderpest could be eradicated quickly.

　　察省是怎样防治牛瘟的？
    本报记者  吕光明
    今年一月间，察北多伦发生牛瘟，初患时，混身发抖，舌头肿烂，咽喉发炎，不饮不食；继则吐黄水，拉大痢，恶臭，咳嗽，鼻孔出血，停止反＠；死后肺部溃烂且奇臭，肝硬结，胆涨大，小肠有血，重者三四天即死。此病初由蒙古草地传染至多伦，复因贩卖、运输，迅速向西传至崇礼等县，向南传至平北。三个多月以来，疫区蔓延至察北专区康保等七个县及冀察专区的赤城、龙关、四海、怀柔四个县，共十一个县及内蒙太仆左旗。其中以多伦、宝源为最严重。据多伦土城口等七个村的调查，共有牛三千头，死去一千头。至二月十五日，多伦全县已死牛二千八百头。以上两个专区，据不完全统计，死牛达四千一百九十九头之多，连各县最近死亡统计在内，当在五千头以上。另外国营、公营商业部门及供销社向各地供销之耕牛，共约五千头，途中死亡达九百五十头。当地群众记得，伪蒙疆政府统治时期，曾发生过一次大牛灾，死亡全部耕牛一半以上。当时敌伪政府借机抽走大批好牛血，饱发牛灾财。因之群众对此次牛瘟异常恐怖，部份群众对我之预防注射，最初亦抱怀疑与观望态度。
    此次牛瘟在去年底尚处于萌芽时期。多伦县政府曾报告察北专署，专署当即指示了一些治瘟偏方。二月十日情况较为严重，察北地委用电话报告到省，省府先后发了四次紧急指示，谓必须将抢救耕牛列为当前头等重要工作。当时从专署到村立即成立了兽疫防治委员会，并配备大批干部，深入到村，开展群众性的防治运动。在“预防重于治疗”的正确方针下，首先在疫区周围建立封锁线和检查站，实行隔绝。并立即解散牛市，停止贩运。在牛瘟危险区未解严以前，绝对禁止牛只出入。与此同时，省府报告了华北人民政府。先后由察蒙牧畜场、牲畜学校、华北军区的北平军马防疫处，调派了七十三位医师及察蒙牧畜学校四十二个学员，连同省、专的干部，共组织了四个医疗队，乘汽车赶赴察北、冀察各地灾区。
    工作进行中，在党的统一领导下，党政军民与医疗队间密切配合，充分发挥了为人民服务的精神。新解放城市的医务工作者们，首次深入乡村，冒塞外严寒，起早摸黑，情绪甚高。但由于疫区面积过大，不免有些顾此失彼，为此，省府特转请华北人民政府向东北行政委员会请援，该会当即派出三十一人的医疗大队，携带十六万西西的抗瘟血清，连华北北平防疫处培制的兔化毒疫苗共四十万西西的注射药及大批制药材料，分路由外线向内压缩，如此停止向外蔓延，以便最后达到全部扑灭的目的。在察北首先划定疫区，以宝源为重点，以张北大囫囵为防治起点，由起点分向西北、东北两侧线发展。并在各交通要路，设站隔绝牛车牛群出入。至三月六日，包括张北、宝源、康保，及左旗四个县九个区七十二个村的注射工作，已全面展开。据三月十日统计，察北专区已注射好牛一万余头，治好的牛有三百余头，察北牛瘟情况遂告好转。
    在冀察区的赤城发现牛瘟后，该县立即报告省府，并组织中医用土法治疗，同时抽调大批干部下乡检查。当时虽收效不大，但打下了防治基础，该县牛瘟之被迅速扑灭与此有很大关系。医疗队到达后，该县于短期内在外围设下七十个封锁卡，内地设立了四十四个检查站。各区将实业助理员、联社主任抽出，专门负责领导民兵进行牛群隔离，及戒严检查工作（指禁止牛车牛只出入）。各村党员并保证执行各项防御办法，故在注射防疫针时，很多村作到牛等人。去该县之医疗队，包括随员及一部份配合工作的地方干部，多学会了注射技术，至三月六日，经二十天的艰苦努力，终于完成五千六百余头牛的注射任务，约占全县总牛数的百分之七十，牛瘟乃告扑灭。三月七日该队转赴四海、怀柔两县，进行防治工作，至三月二十日，基本上已完成了冀察专区防治扑灭工作。
    根据该县的经验，应以防御为主，即隔离与注射并重。并要作深入恰当的宣传解释工作。首先应打破群众“天年”“由命”的迷信思想，说明牛瘟是传来的，只有严格地预防，才能避免。对新区群众还要说明人民政府与敌伪、国民党反动政府有根本上的不同，以消除怕打了针，当下不能使用，怕打坏胎牛，怕抽走牛血，怕要钱等顾虑。经宣传后，群众去掉怀疑，对医疗队就会争相迎接邀请，或远道牵牛前往就医。该县在此次防治牛瘟过程中，真正作到了宣传、组织、技术三大工作密切结合，因此，牛瘟能够迅速扑灭。
