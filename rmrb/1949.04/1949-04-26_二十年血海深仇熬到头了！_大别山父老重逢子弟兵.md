Xinhua News Agency, Central China Front, April 25th: "Twenty years of blood feud have finally come to an end!" The people of the Dabie Mountains are spreading the news of the southward advance of the liberation army. As they rushed towards the surging ranks with mixed feelings of grief and joy, the relatives of the Red Army discovered that the guerrillas who had left home twenty years ago had become invincible field armies equipped with American weapons. In Xuanhua Store, the place where the Kuomintang reactionaries first bloodbathed when they launched a full-scale civil war, artillery salutes are now sounding, and cheers are constantly erupting from the crowds lining the streets: "The days of suffering are over!" "Twenty years of revolution have finally paid off!" The Dabie Mountains, the revolutionary homeland that has been massacred four times by counter-revolutionaries, one of the birthplaces of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, the beautiful home and fertile land of the Red Army soldiers, has now been burned and killed by the reactionaries into a sparsely populated and desolate place. In Xin County (renamed Jingfu by the Kuomintang reactionary government) alone, more than 3,000 people were brutally murdered under the charge of being "Red Army family members," and many families were wiped out. On the road from Xiji to Macheng for more than one hundred miles, almost every village and town has been burned down, and many families in every village and town have been harmed and destroyed. Xu Qixiao, a Red Army soldier and current division commander, excitedly returned to Dahepu in Macheng to see his home. But his heart turned cold as soon as he entered the village. The once bustling market town he remembered now only had six households and three young people left. His home had become ruins, and his father, elder brother, and younger brother had all been killed, leaving only his seventy-year-old mother begging for food. When Division Commander Xu Qixiao found her, he hugged her and cried out, "Qixiao, our whole family has been killed by the White bandits!" When Army Commanders Zhou Xihan and Li Chengfang returned to their hometown of Macheng, they could not find which pile of weed-covered ruins was their own home. Outside a small mountain village in Xiaoshiwan, an old lady with blind eyes sat by the roadside and grabbed the passing soldiers, saying, "Comrades, tell me, are you leaving again? You must never leave us again." Her name was Guo, and two of her sons had joined the Red Army. Her third son also joined the Central Plains Liberation Army three years ago. During the breakout of the Central Plains Liberation Army in a certain month of 1946, her third son was captured by the bandit army and local security team after being separated from the team. The bandits nailed her son to the ground with wooden nails in front of her and shot her nephew who wanted to join the Liberation Army. From then on, she went crazy and became blind. The only thing that has not changed in the Dabie Mountains is the people's unwavering loyalty to the revolution. "We knew you would definitely come back!" They said to the soldiers beside the endless ranks, "Our children have also joined the Red Army like you. Seeing you now is like seeing our own sons." At a forum held by a certain unit for the families of the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army, the revolutionary elders counted the years their children had been away from home and expressed their long-standing desire for revenge. Supported by the Liberation Army cadres, the 84-year-old Wang smiled and said, "My child has been in our army for nineteen years. I never thought I would live to see you, and I would live to see the world of us poor people!" The relatives of the Red Army praised: the current Liberation Army is as good as the original Chinese Red Army, and they love the people and are supported by the people. The difference is that there are many more people and weapons! "The Dabie Mountains can be considered bright!" The suffering people under the long-term encirclement and suppression of the counter-revolutionaries said with relief. The people of the Dabie Mountains everywhere established front-line support headquarters and supply stations, repaired roads and built bridges day and night, mobilized ferry boats, and prepared a large number of rain hats, umbrellas, colored buildings, tea stations, and welcome red flags all the way to the river, just like they cared for the Red Army soldiers back then. The suffering and ardent hope of the people in the Red Army's hometown moved every soldier of the Liberation Army in the Dabie Mountains. A certain political commissar excitedly said at a meeting: "When the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army went north to resist Japan, it held the first 25,000-li Long March in history; now, advancing from the liberated north to the south of the Yangtze River, the entire China will be completely liberated in this second great Long March in history!"

　　“二十年血海深仇熬到头了！”
  　大别山父老重逢子弟兵
    【新华社中原前线二十五日电】“二十年的血海深仇熬到头了!”大别山人民这样地奔走相告着南下解放大军到来的消息。当他们悲喜交集地奔向潮涌而来滚滚行列时，红军的亲属们发现离家二十年的游击队已经变成全副美械装备的无敌野战军。在宣化店，国民党反动派发动全面内战时首先血洗的地方，现在礼炮齐鸣，夹道欢迎的人丛不时发出欢呼：“苦难的日子过去了！”“闹了廿年的革命这回有头了！”大别山，这个被反革命屠杀过四次的革命故乡，中国人民解放军的诞生地之一，红军战士们的美丽家乡和丰饶的土地，现在已经被反动派烧杀成人烟稀少，一片荒凉的地方了。仅仅新县（国民党反动政府把它改名经扶）城关一地，在“红军家属”的罪名下惨遭虐杀的就有三千多人，许多人家灭门绝户。从新集到麻城一百多里的路上，几乎没有一个村镇没有被烧毁过，每个村镇都有许多人家被残害的家破人亡。红军战士现任师长的徐其孝兴奋地回到麻城大河铺去看他自己的家。但他一进村心就冷了。记忆中的热闹集镇现在只剩下六户人家和三个青年。他的家已成了废墟，他的父亲、哥哥、兄弟都被杀了，只剩下一个七十多岁母亲在讨饭。当徐其孝师长找到她时，就一把抱住他痛哭失声地说：“其孝，我们一家都被白党杀了呀！”周希汉和李成芳两位军长回到麻城故乡时，也都找不出那一堆长满荒草的败墙是自己的家门。在小石湾的小山庄外，一位双目失明的老太太坐在路边扯住路过的战士们说：“同志们，跟我说，你们还走不走，可千万不能再离开我们了。”她姓郭，两个儿子参加了红军，第三个儿子三年前也参加了中原解放军，在一九四六年某月中原解放军突围时，她的第三个儿子因掉队被匪军乡保队捉住，匪徒们当着她的面用木钉子把她儿子钉死在地上，又枪毙了她的一个想参加解放军的侄子。从此，她就疯了，眼也瞎了。大别山唯一不变的是人民对革命坚贞不移的心。“早知道你们一定要回来的！”他们在望不到头的行列旁边对战士们说：“我们的孩子也和你们一样地参加红军了。如今看到你们，就象看到自己的儿子一样了。”某部邀请的一个中国工农红军家属座谈会上，革命老人们屈指计算着自己的子弟们离家的岁月，倾诉着多年来伸冤报仇的心愿。让解放军干部扶着的八十四岁的王老太太笑不住嘴地说：“我的孩子参加咱队伍十九年了。想不到我还能活着看到你们，还能活着看到咱穷人的天下！”红军的亲属们都夸奖着：现在的解放军和最初的中国红军一样好，一样爱护人民和为人民拥戴，不同的是人马武器都多得多了！“大别山可算天光（亮）啦！”在反革命长期围剿进攻下的苦难人民透着大气说。大别山的人民到处建立支援前线司令部、供应站，日夜抢修公路、铺架桥梁、调集渡船、和当年爱护红军战士一样地准备了大批雨帽雨伞、彩楼、茶水站和欢迎的红旗一直摆到江边。红军故乡人民的苦难和热望激动过着大别山的每一个解放军的战士。某政委在一个会师大会上兴奋地说：“中国工农红军北上抗日时，曾举行了历史上第一次的二万五千里长征；现在从解放了的北方进军江南，全中国将在这历史上的又一次伟大长征中完全解放！”
