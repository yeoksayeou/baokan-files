Cooperation Hero Zhang Qiulin
    Wei Ying
    Zhang Qiulin is a good example of rural women's production movement in the Jin-Sui sub-region, a cooperation hero who emerged from the masses. She is the representative of the Jin-Sui sub-region to attend the National Women's Congress.
    In the labor hero conferences of 1943 and 1944, she won the glorious title of Special Class Labor Hero First Place.
    After returning to the village from the Labor Hero Conference, she immediately implemented the production plan established at the meeting, mobilized and organized women for labor exchange and mutual assistance, weaving standard cloth, and established a textile cooperative. She and the village cadres traveled to more than a dozen villages to collect share capital from the masses. But she encountered great difficulties because a farmer's cooperative formed by collecting shares in this area was burned down by the enemy before she collected shares; the women were unwilling to contribute shares again. So every time she went to a village, she first mobilized at the cadre meeting, and then held a women's conference, saying to the women: "It is beneficial to run a textile cooperative, and I guarantee that everyone will not lose money. The more shares you invest, the more dividends you get." Under the leadership of the cadres, plus the trust of the masses in her, the share capital was collected. But when collecting shares, she found that landlords and rich peasants invested a lot of shares, so she restricted the number of shares, but poor women could invest half a share. She grew up in poverty, so she can care for poor women everywhere.
    The Zhang Qiulin Cooperative was established in a large kiln in Zhangjia Village, concentrating several fast looms, preparing to organize women to weave cloth. The government also helped with some funds, and the cooperative lent money to poor farmers to buy raw materials and tools. At the request of the masses, some daily necessities were also provided for farmers to purchase.
    Women from nearby villages went to the cooperative to buy cotton and tools, spun and wove them into yarn and cloth at home, and then the cooperative helped to carry them to Lin County in bundles of thirty or fifty bolts to sell them, and then carried the grain back. In this way, the cooperative made a profit, and the women earned money and spent it, and then went back to produce again. The cooperative's share capital is mainly used for developing textiles, lending to women, and purchasing spinning wheels, looms, and cotton, all solving the practical difficulties of the masses in production in terms of raw materials, tools, and technology.
    She organized women to spin and weave together, creating a method of labor exchange, using pencils to draw lines to record work, because the women did not know how to use an abacus. They calculated their working hours, wages, etc. orally. Labor exchange and mutual assistance made it possible for women without looms and capital to produce. Those who worked more got more money, and those who worked less got less. Some families, with one woman and two young girls of thirteen or fourteen years old, wove standard cloth, which could be used to pay a year's worth of public grain, and the rest could provide clothing for the whole family. The masses knew the benefits of the cooperative from their own interests.
    The work was very busy at the beginning. She was busy in the cooperative collecting cloth, distributing cotton, and weighing, and she also had to handle administrative work in the village, sometimes busy until the roosters crowed twice before going to sleep, but she never lost her temper. The accountant in the cooperative often lost his temper with the masses. Zhang Qiulin patiently persuaded and educated him. The accountant was moved and said: "I have never seen such a capable woman!"
    The cotton distributed by the cooperative to the village was not enough when it reached the women's hands due to wear and tear back and forth. She noticed this and advocated zero distribution to avoid losses for the women.
    After half a year, each share could be distributed with a dividend of one hundred and eighty yuan. The women all received dividends, and the cooperative's prestige was improved, and the number of members increased to three hundred and sixty-one. She did a lot for the masses, but she was not proud at all, and modestly improved her work, and more actively tried to free up energy to help women with labor exchange and mutual assistance. She also selected people from each labor exchange group to learn fast loom weaving, and then promoted fast loom weaving among women.
    Because she correctly implemented the policy of developing production and the mass line, the capital of the Qiulin Cooperative has expanded four or five times today. In addition to textiles, it has added business and medical departments. Dividends are distributed per share in each period. When poor farmers are short of money, they can also go to the cooperative to buy on credit.
    Hero Zhang Qiulin will redouble her strength in the future rural production movement. The cooperative she painstakingly founded, although only a prototype, has illuminated a glorious path for the cooperative production of the vast rural women in the new China!

　　合作英雄张秋林
    韦荧
    张秋林是晋绥分区农村妇女生产运动中的好榜样，从群众中间产生的一个合作社英雄。为晋绥分区出席全国妇代大会的代表。
    一九四三年，和一九四四年的两次劳动英雄大会上，她都获得了特等劳动英雄第一名的光荣称号。
    从劳英大会回到村里，她马上进行在会上订立的生产计划，发动和组织妇女变工互助，织标准布，成立纺织合作社。她和村干部们，跑过十几个村庄，去集合群众的股金。但碰到很大的困难，因为在她集股前，这一带由集股成立的一个农民合作社被敌人烧了；妇女们就不肯再出股了，于是她每走到一个村庄，先在干部会上动员，然后开妇女大会，向妇女们说：“办纺织合作社是有利的事情，我保证大家赔不了，入的股多，分的红利也多。”在干部带头下，再加上群众对她的信任，股金就集合起了。可是在集股时，她发现地主富农入的股多，就限制股金的数目，但贫妇入半股也行，她从贫苦中长大，所以能处处关心贫苦妇女。
    张秋林合作社，在张家庄的一个大窑里成立了，集中起几架快机，准备组织妇女来织布，政府又帮助了一部分款，由合作社贷款给穷苦的农妇买原料和工具。在群众要求下，又办了些日用品，供农民购买。
    附近村庄里的妇女们到合作社买棉花和工具，回家纺织成纱线布匹，再由合作社帮助，三十匹五十匹一捆一捆的驮上到临县去卖了，再把谷米驮回来，这样合作社就有了利，妇女赚得钱又秤上花，回去再生产。合作社的股金主要放在发展纺织上，有贷款给妇女的，有购买纺车织机和棉花的，都解决群众生产中原料、工具、和技术上的实际困难。
    她组织妇女一块纺织，创造出工变工的方法，用铅笔画道道记工，妇女们不会打算盘。就用口算着自己的工时、工资等。变工互助使没机子和没本钱的妇女有办法生产了，劳动多的多分钱，少的就少分。有的人家家中一个婆姨两个十三四岁的小女子，纺织出标准布，能顶上交一年的公粮，余下的还能供一家大小穿衣。群众从切身利益上知道了合作社的好处。
    工作开始时很忙碌，她一面在合作社忙着收布、发花、拾秤，一面又要到村里办行政工作，有时忙到鸡叫两遍才睡，但从不发脾气。合作社里的会计，常对群众发脾气，张秋林耐心地说服教育他，那会计被感动的说：“我从没见过这么能干的妇女！”
    合作社发到村里的棉花，因来回耗损，到了妇女手中就不够数，她注意到这件事，就主张零发，不叫妇女吃亏。
    过了半年结帐每股能分得红利一百八十元，妇女们都分到红利，合作社威信提高了，社员增加到三百六十一人。她为群众做了许多事，但一点不骄傲，虚心改进工作，更积极的设法抽出力量帮助妇女变工互助。并在每一变工组挑人去学快机织布，随后就在妇女中推广了快机织布。
    由于她正确的执行了发展生产和群众路线的方针，到今天秋林合作社的资本已扩大了四五倍，除纺织外，又增添了营业部、医药部，每期按股分红，贫苦农民手头不济时，还可以到合作社去赊帐。
    英雄张秋林，将在今后的农村生产运动中，更加倍地发挥她浑厚的力量，她艰辛创办的合作社，虽只是一个雏型，但已为新中国广大农村妇女合作生产的前程，照耀出光辉的道路！
