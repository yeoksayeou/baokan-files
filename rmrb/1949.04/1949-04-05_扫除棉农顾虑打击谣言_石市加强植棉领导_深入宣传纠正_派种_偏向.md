　　Eliminate Cotton Farmers' Concerns and Combat Rumors:
    Shijiazhuang City Strengthens Leadership in Cotton Planting
  　Conducts In-Depth Propaganda to Correct "Assigned Planting" Tendencies

    [Our Newspaper's Report] Shijiazhuang City inspected the cotton planting preparations in the suburbs and decided to reorganize forces to thoroughly implement policy education, dispel farmers' various concerns, so that farmers understand that cotton planting is indeed beneficial and plant cotton in large quantities. According to reports from the suburbs on March 17th, except for most of the eighth district being black soil, which is not suitable for cotton planting, the remaining five, six, and seven districts have prepared to plant a total of 14,109 mu of cotton, accounting for 14 percent of the 100,1689 mu of cultivated land in these three districts (last year's cotton planting was 10 percent), which is far from the original plan of 25 percent. The main reasons are:

    (1) The suburbs of the city were originally cotton-producing areas before the War of Resistance Against Japan. During the period when the Japanese invaders and the Kuomintang bandit army occupied the area, the material adjustment between urban and rural areas was isolated due to the war, and cotton farmers could not exchange for equivalent food, suffering losses. In addition, the Japanese invaders forcibly purchased cotton, plundering all the farmers' harvests. This adverse impact caused by the enemy bandits on the farmers has not been completely eliminated to this day.

    (2) Because our policy education has not been thoroughly implemented, some cadres have insufficient understanding, and they either ignore cotton planting or use simple "assigned planting" methods to allocate planting to farmers. As a result, the concerns are getting bigger. Some are afraid of over-reporting, and that they will have to bear more burdens after increased production. For example, a farmer in Dongjiazhuang, Fifth District, actually planned to plant 2.6 mu of cotton, but reported 1.6 mu, saying: "This is for you to plant (referring to the government), and that one mu is my own." Therefore, some farmers underreport the area. In Beidu Village, Seventh District, more than 500 mu of cotton were planted in the past, but only 400 mu are reported now; in Tazhong Village, Eighth District, more than 500 mu were prepared to be planted, but only 300 mu were reported.

    (3) Some are afraid of not being able to exchange for equivalent food. Because the harvest of miscellaneous grains was not large last year, wheat fields account for 50 to 55 percent of the total cultivated land this year. Farmers urgently demand to plant early-maturing crops such as peas in the remaining cultivated land to prepare for the pre-wheat interface; some want to grow grain grass for feeding livestock. In addition, farmers are also afraid of insect plagues and droughts and heavy rains, which reduce cotton production.

    In response to the above situation, the Municipal Construction Bureau decided to reorganize forces, strengthen the sense of responsibility of district and village cadres, go to the villages and use mass organizations, especially the Communist Youth League as the backbone, to carry out repeated and in-depth publicity and mobilization, and let students from the North China Farm and the North China Agricultural College go to the villages to carry out disguised publicity, help farmers calculate specific accounts, use blackboard newspapers to introduce typical examples, organize old farmers to have discussions in villages, especially explain the policies, guarantee that increased production will not increase the burden, and after the cotton harvest, the Municipal Supply and Marketing Cooperative will purchase the members' cotton at a price higher than the market price, or exchange it for grain, to ensure that the members do not suffer losses. For the prevention and control of insect pests, each district will jointly organize forces with the farm and the Agricultural College, set up guidance stations in each district, and introduce insecticides that have been tested and are effective, that is, mixing quicklime with tobacco leaf water, which is very cheap. For the prevention of peach drop after rain, it is proposed to water after rain to reduce the heat of ground water vapor, and use various methods to dispel farmers' concerns, and criticize certain "assigned planting" methods that do not follow the mass line, and also criticize the laissez-faire attitude towards bad people spreading rumors and sabotaging. For example, in Gaozhu Village, Sixth District, a witch dresses up as crazy and makes trouble, coercing her family not to plant cotton. Such sabotage should be effectively stopped.

    [Our Newspaper's Report] As the cotton planting season approaches, the 150,000 jin of S-character cotton (B2) seeds allocated to Shijiazhuang City by the North China People's Government have recently been transported to the city from Beiping. The freight and packaging costs per jin of cotton seeds are equivalent to 2.12 jin of millet. The freight alone is worth 280,000 jin of millet. In order to encourage cotton planting and reduce the burden on seed buyers, the freight and packaging costs are fully covered by the North China Government. The batch of cotton seeds is purchased by the city's Supply and Marketing Cooperative at a price equivalent to one jin of rice per jin, and then distributed to the supply and marketing cooperatives in each district through the farm, and directly lent to cotton planters. It is stipulated that each jin of cotton seeds will be recovered in autumn with 5.5 liang of seed cotton (including interest). 120,000 jin have now been distributed to four districts. In order to maintain pure strains, each district has specially designated pure strain areas, mobilized the masses to exchange hybrid cotton seeds in the area with the Supply and Marketing Cooperative for pure strains, one jin for one jin. In autumn, the farm purchases the seed cotton in the pure strain area at a high price, sets up a ginning factory, maintains the pure strain, and prepares to promote it again. The city's Supply and Marketing Cooperative has also purchased 900,000 jin of fertilizer, which is also being lent to farmers. (Lin Yuan)

### 扫除棉农顾虑打击谣言  石市加强植棉领导　深入宣传纠正“派种”偏向

 　 扫除棉农顾虑打击谣言
    石市加强植棉领导
  　深入宣传纠正“派种”偏向
    【本报讯】石家庄市检查郊区植棉准备情形，决定重新组织力量，深入贯彻政策教育，解除农民的各种顾虑，以使农民了解种棉确实有利，大量种棉。据三月十七日，各郊区报告，除八区大部份是黑土地，不宜种棉外，余五、六、七三个区，共计准备植棉一万四千一百零九亩，占该三个区耕地面积十万零一千六百八十九亩的百分之十四（去年植棉百分之十），距原计划植棉百分之二十五尚远。主要原因是：
    （一）该市郊区在抗战前本是产棉区，当日寇和国民党匪军占领时期，城乡的物资调剂，因战争隔绝，植棉的农民换不到等价的食粮，曾吃了亏，加以日寇的强制收买棉花，掠夺了农民的全部收获，敌匪对农民造成的这种恶劣影响，至今尚未完全消除。
    （二）由于我们的政策教育深入贯彻的不够，有些干部认识不足，对种棉的事情不是放任不管，便是用简单的“派种”方式，分配农民种植。因之引起的顾虑越大。有的怕多报了，增产后要多负担，如五区董家庄一个农民实计划种二亩六分棉，却报一亩六分说：“这是给你们种的（指政府），那一亩是我自己的。”所以有的农民以多报少。七区北杜村过去种棉五百余亩，今只报四百亩；八区塔冢村准备种五百余亩，报了三百亩。
    （三）有的怕换不到等价食粮，因去年杂粮收成不多，今年麦田占全耕地面积百分之五十到五十五，所余耕地农民迫切要求种植豌豆等早熟作物，以备麦前接口；有的因喂牲口，要种谷草。此外，农民还怕遭虫灾，怕遭旱灾猛雨，减少了棉花的收成。
    市建设局针对上述情况，决定重新组织力量，加强区村干部责任心，到村利用群众组织，特别要以青年团作骨干，进行反复深入的宣传动员，并由华北农场和华北农学院的学员，到各村进行化装宣传，帮助农民具体算帐，利用黑板报介绍典型，以村为单位组织老农座谈，特别说明政策，保证增产不增加负担，棉花收获后，市供销总社将以高于市价的价格收买社员的棉花，或以粮食交换，保证社员不吃亏。防除虫害，则由各区与农场和农学院共同组织力量，各区设指导站，并介绍已试行收效的杀虫剂，即用生石灰拌和烟叶水，价钱很便宜。对雨后落桃的预防，提出雨后浇水，降低地面水蒸气的热度，利用各种方式解除农民顾虑，并批评了某些不走群众路线的“派种”方式，也批评了对坏人造谣破坏行为的放任不管态度。如六区高柱村，巫婆装疯闹鬼，胁骗他家人不要种棉，对此等破坏行为，应予有效制止。
    【本报讯】植棉期近，华北人民政府拨给石家庄市的斯字棉（Ｂ２）棉籽十五万斤，日前已由北平运抵该市。每斤棉籽运费和包装费折合小米二点一二斤，只运费一项即值小米二十八万斤，为奖励植棉减少买籽户负担，运费和包装费完全由华北政府开支。该批棉籽以每斤折合一斤米的价格，由该市供销总社收买下，然后，通过农场分发到各区供销社，直接贷给植棉户。规定每斤棉籽，秋后收回籽棉五两半（利息在内），现已发到四个区共十二万斤。并为了保持纯种，各区特划出纯种区，将该区内的杂种棉籽，动员群众向供销社兑换纯种，一斤换一斤，秋后，农场以高价收买该纯种区的籽棉，设轧花厂，保持纯种准备再推广。该市供销总社又购到肥料九十万斤，亦正在贷发给农民。　　（林远）
