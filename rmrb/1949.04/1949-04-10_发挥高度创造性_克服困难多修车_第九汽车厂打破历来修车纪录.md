　　Giving Full Play to High Creativity, Overcoming Difficulties and Repairing More Vehicles
  　The Ninth Automobile Plant Breaks All Previous Repair Records
    [Our Newspaper] The work of the Ninth Automobile Plant in Ping City made great progress in March. The plant repaired 51 vehicles in February (21 major repairs, 30 minor repairs), and then surged to 115 vehicles in March (80 major repairs, 35 minor repairs), breaking the plant's all-time record for the number of vehicles repaired. The distribution department, because they could not buy the crucible (lead powder container) for casting "pistons," painstakingly researched and created a "crucible" made of pig iron. Purchased crucibles cost 15,000 yuan each, while self-made crucibles cost only 2,600 yuan each; purchased crucibles could only be used 12 times each, while self-made crucibles could be used 30 times. It was both cheaper and more durable, and the workers called it the "liberation crucible." In addition, the staff of the distribution department also created a way to rivet and modify "timing gears." In the past, timing gears were thrown away after they became loose, but now, because they are difficult to buy, the staff painstakingly researched and used old ones to re-rivet them. Finally, they discovered a method of replacing the eyelets with grinding shafts to re-rivet, and the result was a complete success. Repairing one timing gear only took four work hours. The workers in the cylinder washing department of the plant automatically organized a night shift, so that the two cylinder washing machines were running day and night, non-stop. Other affiliated factories, welding and other workshops also ensured that vehicles were not delayed. They overcame the past phenomenon of "you wait for me, I wait for you." The sand casting workers in the foundry workshop began to repair the old crucibles to make do with them before the pig iron crucible was made, ensuring a continuous supply of auto parts. After the creation of the pig iron crucible, their enthusiasm was even greater. On the first day, they made more than 120 various "Jeep" "pistons" (the highest daily output of pistons during the Kuomintang rule was only more than 50); fuel consumption was also reduced by two-thirds. Now they are still researching the successful casting of the "Universal Carburetor" as a contribution to the "May 1st" Labor Day. At present, the entire plant is discussing the production plan for April, and the staff generally believe that this plan will definitely be surpassed.

　　发挥高度创造性  克服困难多修车
  　第九汽车厂打破历来修车纪录
    【本报讯】平市第九汽车厂三月份工作获得很大进展。该厂二月份修好汽车五十一部（大修二十一部，小修三十部），三月份即突增至一百一十五部（大修八十部，小修三十五部），打破该厂历来修理汽车数的纪录。配制课因为买不到铸制“活塞”用的钳锅（铅粉罐），便悉心研究，创造了用生铁制“钳锅”。购买的钳锅每个需洋一万五千元，自制的钳锅每个仅合二千六百元；买的钳锅每个只能用十二次，自制的钳锅可用三十次。又省钱又耐用，工人称之为“解放钳锅”。此外，配制课的职工又创造了铆改“调时练”。过去调时练松弛以后就把它扔掉了，现在因为难买，职工们费尽心血研究利用旧的来改铆，最后发现了用磨轴换眼圈的方法重新改铆，结果完全成功，修一个调时练只用四个工。该厂洗缸部工人自动组织夜班，使二部洗缸机昼夜不停的转动。其他附属工厂、电焊等工作间也保证了不耽误出车。克服了过去你等我，我等你的现象。铸工间的翻沙工人，在未制成生铁钳锅前，即已开始把过去旧的钳锅修好来凑合着用，保证汽车零件继续供应。从创制生铁钳锅后，他们的劲头更足，第一天就制成了各种“吉普”“活塞”一百二十多个（国民党统治时期日产活塞最多时才五十多个）；燃料也节省了三分之二。现在他们还在研究把“万国化油器”铸造成功，贡献给“五一”劳动节。目前全厂正在讨论四月份生产计划，职工们普遍相信：这计划一定更能超过。
