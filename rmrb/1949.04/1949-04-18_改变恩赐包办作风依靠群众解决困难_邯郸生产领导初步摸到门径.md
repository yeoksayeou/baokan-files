Changing the Style of Bestowing Favors and Taking Over Everything, Relying on the Masses to Solve Difficulties
Handan's Production Leadership Initially Finds a Path

[This Newspaper Reported] The production leadership work in Handan City has initially reversed the tendency of relief and bestowing favors and has begun to rely on the strength of the masses to overcome difficulties, finding some production avenues. In the past, women in Handan mostly engaged in handicrafts such as knitting sweaters, winding velvet, making ready-made clothes for sale, weaving hairnets and socks, making palm fans, and rolling packaged cigarettes. Recently, due to the influence of the liberation of large cities on handicrafts and seasonal changes, two problems have emerged in production this spring: one is that there is labor but no suitable production avenues, and the other is that small producers have difficulty with capital. A month ago, the municipal party committee deployed work: taking production as the center, combined with temporary tasks such as supporting the front, giving preferential treatment to military families, maternal and child hygiene, and mobilizing to join cooperatives. The work team did not study in advance and did not know how to combine these tasks. The difficulty of leading production was in front of them, and the other work was very specific. They were busy completing temporary tasks, and the central production work naturally fell through. The municipal party committee checked these shortcomings and clarified the view that "production is the overriding central task." The work team restarted organizing production, but still with a set of viewpoints of bestowing favors and relief and methods of taking over everything. Similarly, village cadres have not had the habit of independently solving problems for a long time. When production was mentioned, they raised difficulties: "How can we produce without capital or work?" "The bank's loans have been recovered, factories are using fewer people, and trains are not running, so goods cannot be sold... what can we do?" Some even said: "If these specific problems are not solved, we cannot produce." The work team proposed: "The shoe factory is recruiting workers to make shoes, everyone can go." However, urban women are not accustomed to heavy work and said, "Such heavy work can only be done by people from the mountains, we can't do it." The cadres also felt that it was really impossible to do. Production work was frustrated again. After the help of the municipal party committee's leadership and everyone's research, they discovered that the key to the problem was in the work viewpoint and method. After criticism and research, they analyzed what were the actual difficulties and what were ideological obstacles. Then they started from small things and relied on the masses to overcome difficulties themselves. The party members in Southwest Village held a meeting to study production and raised those difficulties again. Under the new guidance, the masses' thinking of fearing profit and fearing heavy work was criticized. It was immediately pointed out that making shoes for the shoe factory not only does not require capital, but also guarantees a way out. Fearing heavy work is a matter of labor habits and should be corrected. At the same time, the comrades of the work team took the lead in learning and trying to do it. Lack of capital was originally a big difficulty. In the past, people with a little savings were unwilling to lend money, fearing that they would be accused of exploitation; people who borrowed money were also afraid that the interest rate would be inappropriate and that prices would rise and fall, so they dared not borrow. Once the problem was explained, it was easy to handle. Liu Songshi, a party member in Southwest Village, guaranteed good faith and borrowed capital. Zhao Yude had two hundred catties of wheat but did not dare to lend it out in the past. Li Fuzi had a donkey and a mill but no capital. After negotiation, they decided to use bran and black flour to offset the donkey's labor, and split the profits equally. They would withdraw the capital after the wheat harvest in May, and the two families started milling flour together. In this way, relying on credit to develop private lending, turning dead money into active capital, and organizing small-scale mutual assistance that combines labor and capital on the principle of not suffering losses from each other, they have initially found a path to leading production.

### 改变恩赐包办作风依靠群众解决困难　邯郸生产领导初步摸到门径

　　改变恩赐包办作风依靠群众解决困难
  　邯郸生产领导初步摸到门径
    【本报讯】邯郸市的生产领导工作，已初步扭转救济恩赐偏向，开始依靠群众力量克服困难，找到一些生产门路。邯郸妇女过去多从事打毛衣、络绒子、做卖成件衣服、织头网子袜子、编蒲扇、卷包纸烟等手工业生产，最近由于大城市解放后给予手工业的影响，及季节的变化，今春生产上出现两个问题：一是有劳力的无适当生产门路，一是小本生产者资金困难。一月前，市委布置了工作：以生产为中心，结合支持前线、优待军属、妇婴卫生、动员入合作社等临时任务，工作组事先没有研究，不知道该怎样把这些工作结合起来。领导生产的困难摆在眼前，另外的工作又非常具体，忙于完成临时任务，中心的生产工作自然就落空了。市委检查了这些缺点，明确了“生产是压倒一切的中心工作”观点后，工作组重新开始组织生产，但仍是带着一套恩赐救济观点和包办代替方式。同样，村干部长期也没有独立解决问题的习惯。一说生产，就提出了困难：“没本钱没活干怎样生产？”“银行的贷款收回去了，工厂用的人少了，火车不通货卖不出去……我们做什么？”甚至说：“不解决这些具体问题，我们是生产不起来的。”工作组提出：“鞋厂招工纳鞋，大家可以去。”可是城市妇女不习惯做重活，都说：“那样重的活除非山里人做得了，俺们不行。”干部们也就觉得真是做不了。生产工作再次遭到挫折。经过市委领导的帮助和大家的钻研，发现了问题的关键在于工作观点和方法有毛病。经过了批判研究，分析了哪是实际困难，那是思想障碍，然后由小处着手，依靠群众自己起来克服困难。西南庄党员开会研究生产，又提出那些困难，在新的指导下，对群众的等大利怕重活思想就得到了批判，当即指出给鞋厂做鞋既不用本钱，出路又有保证，怕活重是劳动习惯问题，应该改正。同时工作组同志首先带头学习试做。没本钱本是个大困难，过去稍有积蓄的人不肯往外借钱，怕说是剥削；借钱的人也怕利钱不合适，物价有涨有落而不敢借。问题讲通了就好办，西南庄党员刘宋氏保证守信用，便借到了本钱。赵玉德有二百斤麦子过去不敢往外借，李夫子有驴有磨没本钱，双方商量决定麸子黑面顶驴工，赚利对半分，五月收麦后抽本钱，两家就合伙磨起面来。这样依靠信用发展私人借贷，把死钱变成活资本，并在互不吃亏的原则下，组织劳力资本相互结合的小型互助，从这中已初步摸索到领导生产的门径。　　（苏幼民）
