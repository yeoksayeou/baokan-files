This is a record of the Kuomintang reactionaries' massacre of three employees of the Shanghai Public Bus Company on February 17th, translated from the March 8th Hong Kong English-language "China Digest."

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　——Translator Bo Wen

In mid-February, the worker movement in Shanghai developed to a new scale. Four thousand workers on the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway went on strike first to demand improved treatment. Workers on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway also rose up in response. Subsequently, the Shanghai Public Utility Bureau Public Bus Company, the French-owned Tram Company, and the French-owned Public Bus Company all went on strike one after another, paralyzing railway transportation from Shanghai to Nanjing and Hangzhou, and bringing the city's transportation to a semi-paralyzed state.

On the evening of February 17th, the Kuomintang Songhu Garrison Command massacred three innocent employees of the Shanghai Public Bus Company.

Requesting Emergency Rice Subsidies

Initially, the workers of the Public Bus Company requested the same treatment as the workers of the French-owned Water and Electricity Company, that is, wages and subsidies should be determined according to the cost of living index for the second half of the month. On the 9th, at a company business meeting, Zhong Quanzhou, chairman of the employee welfare association, was invited to make suggestions, which were immediately ignored by the company authorities.

However, Zhao Zengyu, director of the Public Utility Bureau and director of the Public Bus Company, pretended to submit the matter for public discussion to show his "democratic demeanor." According to Zhao Zengyu's order, Zhong Quanzhou convened a meeting of employee representatives from various departments. In the six resolutions, everyone agreed to propose two points: first, the emergency rice subsidy should be set at six dou; second, the rice subsidy should follow the same steps as the French-owned Water and Electricity Company. All resolutions were reported to the company by Zhong Quanzhou on behalf of the employees.

The company decided that the issue of rice subsidies would be considered after investigation. As for emergency subsidies, they were rejected altogether.

On the morning of the 16th, after the workers learned of this decision, buses were driven back to the parking lot one by one. At eight o'clock in the morning, Zhong Quanzhou was stopped by striking workers on his way to the office, demanding that he negotiate with the company again to reach a solution.

Zhong Quanzhou was a graduate of the Electrical Engineering Department of the Southwest Associated University, and a sincere and simple person. He was hired by the Public Bus Company after graduating in 1945. He proved his ability in three years of hard work and enthusiastic service to his fellow workers. In his conversation with Director Zhao, he asked Director Zhao to consider the workers' demands. The matter remained unresolved until late that night, and the negotiations reached a stalemate.

However, that afternoon, Director Zhao Zengyu had secretly planned to notify the Garrison Command, hand over the list and photos of the personnel they had decided to remove to the Garrison Command, and request the arrest of these people in the name of inciting labor unrest.

Unwarranted Atrocities

In the evening, Zhong Quanzhou returned home as usual and listened to the radio with his newly married wife. At eleven o'clock, Kuomintang secret agents broke into his home and searched it thoroughly. Zhong Quanzhou was arrested and taken to the Garrison Command. It is said that more than 30 people were arrested that night. Another said: more than 80 people were arrested.

The charges against Zhong Quanzhou were unwarranted. He was accused of "inciting French-owned Tram workers to go on a go-slow." In fact, after the strike, he only made a phone call to inquire about the implementation of the rice subsidy for reference, and this was what Director Zhao asked him to inquire about, which can be proved in the minutes of the 134th regular meeting (chaired by Zhao Zengyu) held in the Public Utility Bureau conference room. As a result, Zhong Quanzhou was sentenced to ten years in prison, and finally "promoted" to the death penalty.

Employee Gu Bokang proposed that Public Bus Company employees should receive a six-dou emergency rice subsidy. This proposal resulted in Gu Bokang's death sentence; during the same period, the lowest-level employees of the Kuomintang state-owned four major banks received subsidies of 150,000 gold yuan, which could buy more than 15 dou of rice at that time.

There was no excuse for the execution of employee Wang Yuan. Wang Yuan's arrest was heartbreaking. He lived in his sister's house, which was very remote and hardly ever saw a car passing by. On the day he was arrested, his sister saw a car nearby. She became suspicious and remembered that her brother had been arrested once for speaking at a gathering and was only released on Lunar New Year's Eve. During this period of the Public Bus workers' strike, she feared that her brother would be arrested again. She advised him to leave immediately and hide. However, he said that he had not spoken at any meetings recently, and he had nothing to fear. He did not listen to her advice and was finally arrested. He asked the secret agents to let him bring his bedding, thinking that he could be released within a month or two. But he never thought that he would be executed. In addition to these three employees sentenced to death, another six people were sentenced to three to five years in prison.

According to the court's verdict records, Tang Enbo, commander of the Kuomintang Garrison Command in the Nanjing-Shanghai-Hangzhou area, had ordered that all nine people be shot immediately. But his subordinates thought that shooting nine people at once was too much, and Tang Enbo decided on the death penalty for three people.

At 5:10 pm on February 17th, the striking workers began to resume work in order to save the condemned employees, but this action was still delayed and could not change the brutal decision to execute three innocent people at 6 o'clock.

Where are you?

At 6 o'clock on February 17th, three innocent young people who served the interests of the masses were taken to Jiangwan and shot. After sunset, friends received the tragic news, and were extremely saddened. They hurried to look for the bodies. In this dark and windy wilderness, the bodies were not found until eleven o'clock. Zhong Quanzhou was naked, only wrapped in a coat, and the other two were in even worse condition, wearing thin clothes!

At the same time, a tragedy also occurred in the home of the deceased. After Zhong Quanzhou's wife heard the news of her husband's death, she cried bitterly. She was so grief-stricken that she attempted to hang herself, but was fortunately discovered by neighbors who saved her. They had been married for less than a year, and Mrs. Zhong was already pregnant. The scene of her determined suicide attempt was truly unbearable to think about, and also unimaginable.

The remains of the three victims were collected by the Xieqiao Funeral Home. Perhaps the Public Bus Company was "too financially strained," their coffins were very thin and the ceremony was very simple. Mrs. Zhong cried incessantly as she watched the ceremony, and Gu Bokang's old mother was also heartbroken. No one who attended the ceremony was not sympathetic and shed tears. The Public Bus Company authorities were unwilling to make any further efforts, and even unwilling to raise funds for the families of the deceased. Finally, the Shanghai branch of the Southwest Associated University Alumni Association initiated a fundraising campaign to support the Zhong family's descendants.

"I am innocent"

On the 21st, a local newspaper published the full text of Zhong Quanzhou's will:

"In the past few labor disputes, the company repeatedly asked me to mediate. I asked the company to prove my behavior and my position as a mediator... My family, I ask classmate Zhao Sen (transliteration) to take care of."

On the afternoon of the 20th, Zhong Quanzhou's brother-in-law took a written will to see Zhao Zengyu. The servant first said that the master was taking a nap upstairs. When Zhao Zengyu learned the name of the visitor, he told the servant that he was not in. At this time, Zhong Quanzhou's brother-in-law felt helpless, and repeatedly asked the servant to tell the master that he himself, like Zhao Zengyu, was a civil servant (Mrs. Zhong and her brother worked in the local court), and his purpose was to ask for sympathy rather than to cause trouble. He only wanted to talk to Zhao Zengyu once to fulfill the wishes of the deceased. To his disappointment, the servant still replied that the master was "really" out. Zhong Quanzhou's brother-in-law then left there very dejectedly. Later, Mrs. Zhong personally wrote a letter to Zhao Zengyu, telling him the last words of her murdered husband.

Crocodile tears

"Deep regret"

It is said that Zhao Zengyu felt very embarrassed after reading the newspaper on the morning of the 21st. He felt that he should find someone to approach the Zhong family and make some explanations, but no one was willing to explain for him. Even more shameful was that in a speech on the 18th, he had said:

"I express my deep regret for the unfortunate encounter of this company. As for the arrest and interrogation of some employees, the responsibility lies entirely with the security authorities and has nothing to do with me."

He further said that he was not concerned with anything other than the reconstruction and improvement of the city's public utilities.

In fact, Zhao Zengyu only "reconstructed" illegality and "promoted" slaughter!

Revenge will be taken on the murderers

The Executive Committee of the Shanghai Association of Scientific Workers (Mr. Zhong was a member) decided to protest the murder of Zhong Quanzhou. However, fearing that such a protest would not be published in the newspaper, they wrote a letter of condolence to Mr. Zhong's family. It is said that the alumni associations of Shanghai, Peking University, Tsinghua University, and Nankai University jointly issued a declaration of protest.

The reaction here (referring to Hong Kong) was not as clear and forceful as the reaction from all walks of life in Beiping in the CCP broadcast on the evening of the 21st. The Public Bus Company has now resumed work. Although no one dares to openly talk about the emergency subsidy, which was the focus of the dispute, no articles commemorating this event have been published in the newspaper. The criminals and their accomplices are secretly rejoicing at having suppressed the worker dispute, but under the bloody pressure, hatred has been planted in the hearts of every conscientious person. The people are looking to the north, believing that the day of punishing war criminals is near.

　　上海三职工的惨死
    陆秀芳（译音）
    这是一篇记述二月十七日国民党反动派在上海屠杀公共汽车公司三位职工的记录，译自三月八日香港英文“中国文摘”。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　——译者伯文
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
    二月中旬，上海的工人运动发展到了一个新的规模，京沪铁路四千工人为了要求改善待遇首先罢工，沪杭路工人亦起而响应，随后上海市公用局公共汽车公司、法商电车公司以及法商公共汽车公司都相继罢工，使上海到南京、杭州的铁路交通都瘫痪了，市内交通也呈半瘫痪状态。
    十二月十七日黄昏，国民党淞沪警备司令部便屠杀了上海市公共汽车公司的三位无辜职工。
    要求紧急补助食米
    事件起初，市公共汽车公司工人要求与法商水电公司工人有同等待遇，即工资和津贴根据下半月的生活指数规定。九日，公司业务会议上，员工福利会主席钟泉周被邀提出建议，这个建议当即遭到公司当局的漠视。
    不过，公用局局长兼公共汽车公司主任赵曾钰，为表示他的“民主风度”起见，假装要把这件事情提交公议，钟泉周根据赵曾钰的命令，便召开了各部门职工代表会议，在六项决议中，大家同意提出两点：第一点，紧急补助食米应定为六斗；第二点，食米津贴应与法商水电公司采取同一步骤。所有决议由钟泉周代表职工向公司报告。
    公司决定，食米津贴问题经调查后当予考虑。至于紧急补助，则一概拒绝。
    十六日早晨工人知道这个决定后，公共汽车一辆一辆的开回停车场。早晨八点钟，钟泉周在赴办公室途中被罢工工人阻住，要求他再向公司交涉，以获得解决。
    钟泉周是西南联大电机系毕业生，为人诚朴。一九四五年毕业后被雇于公共汽车公司。在三年辛勤工作和对伙伴工人的热心服务中证明了他的能力。在和赵主任的谈话中，他要求赵主任考虑工人的要求。直到当天深夜，事件仍旧没有解决，谈判成了僵局。
    可是当天下午赵曾钰主任已经秘密计划通知警备司令部，把他们决定要除去的人员的名单和照片交给警备司令部，并且以鼓动工潮为名，要求将这些人逮捕。
    莫须有的暴行
    晚上钟泉周和平日一样回家，和他的新婚夫人一同听着无线电。十一点，国民党特务闯到他家里搜查了一遍。钟泉周被捕，被带到警备司令部。据说当晚被捕的有三十多人。另一说：被捕的在八十人以上。
    钟泉周的罪名是莫须有的。他被控“鼓动法商电车工人进行怠工”。事实上，在罢工以后他只不过打电话询问食米津贴实行情形以为参考而已，而且这是赵主任要他询问的，在公用局会议室举行的第一百三十四次常会（由赵曾钰主席）会议记录中可证明这一点。结果钟泉周被判十年徒刑，最后“晋升”到死刑。
    职工顾伯康是提议公共汽车公司职工应得六斗紧急食米补助的。这一提议就使顾伯康判了死刑；在同一时期，国民党国营四大银行最低级的职员却得到十五万金元的津贴，当时可买十五斗米以上。
    职工王元被处死刑是没有任何借口的。王元的被捕令人悲痛。他住在她姐姐家里，这所房子很偏僻，几乎从来不见有汽车经过。他被捕那天，他姐姐看见附近有一辆汽车。她疑惑起来，并且想起她弟弟曾经因为在一次集会中讲话而被捕，于阴历大年夜晚才释放出来。当此公共汽车工人罢工期间，她怕她的弟弟又会被捕。她劝他立即离开隐藏起来。不过他说最近开会他没讲话，他没什么可怕的。他没有听她的劝告，终于被捕了。他要求特务让他把被褥带去，他还以为一两个月之内可以释放的。可是他一点没有想到他会被处死刑。除了这三位判处死刑的职工外，另外有六个人被判三年到五年的徒刑。
    从法庭的判决记录看来，京沪杭地区国民党警备司令汤恩伯，曾经命令过立刻把九个人都枪毙。但他的下属认为一下子枪毙九个人未免太过分了些，汤恩伯决定了三个人的死刑。
    二月十七日下午五点十分，罢工工人为了拯救被判受刑的职工开始复工了，可是这样做法，仍迟延不了，也变更不了六点钟枪决三个无辜者的残暴决定。
    你在哪儿？
    二月十七日六点整，三个为群众利益服务的无罪的青年人被带到江湾枪毙了。日落以后朋友们接获噩耗，悲痛万分，赶紧去找寻尸体。在这月黑天高，寒风刺骨的漫漫荒野里，直到十一点钟尸体方才找到。钟泉周赤着身子，光裹了一件大衣，其他两位景况更惨，穿的是薄薄单衣！
    同时，被难者家里也发生了一个悲剧，钟泉周夫人听到丈夫的死讯以后，伤心大哭。她悲痛已极企图自缢，幸而邻人发觉得早，把她救了过来。他们结婚不满一年，钟夫人已经有孕了，她打定主意要自杀的情景真教人不忍想，而且也难以想象。
    三个被难者的遗体由斜桥殡仪馆收殓。也许公共汽车公司“经济太紧迫”，他们的棺木很薄，仪式也很简陋。钟夫人看着仪式恸哭不止，顾伯康的老母也哀伤欲绝，观礼的没有一个不同情流泪。公共汽车公司当局却不愿再尽任何力量，甚至也不愿意为死者家属募捐，最后还是由西南联大校友会上海分会校友发起募捐，教养钟氏遗族。
    “我是无辜的”
    二十一日，当地的一张报纸登载了钟泉周遗言全文：
    “在过去几次劳工纠纷中，公司屡次要我调解，我要求公司证明我的行为和我作调人的地位，……我的家属，我请同学赵森（译音）先生照料。”
    二十日下午，钟泉周妻舅带了书面遗嘱去见赵曾钰，当差的先说主人在楼上睡午觉。等到赵曾钰知道来访者的名字以后，他便告诉当差的说他不在。这时候钟泉周的妻舅觉得毫无办法，再度的请求当差的转告主人，说他自己和赵曾钰一样的是公务员（钟夫人和他兄弟同在地方法院任职），他来的目的是要求同情而不是来找麻烦，他只要和赵曾钰谈一次话，达成死者的意旨就是了。使他失望的是：当差仍是回答说，主人“真的”出去了。钟泉周的妻舅于是非常沮丧的离开那儿，后来，钟夫人亲自写了一封信给赵曾钰，告诉他她被害丈夫的遗言。
    猫哭老鼠
    “深表遗恨”
    据说二十一日早晨赵曾钰读了报纸以后，觉得非常尴尬。他觉得他应当找人和钟氏家属接近作一些解释，可是没有人愿意代他去解释。更可耻的是在十八日的一篇谈话中他曾经说过：
    “对本公司之不幸遭遇，深表遗憾。至于一部分员工之被捕与审讯，其责权全在治安当局，与本人无关”。
    他更说，除了市公用事业之重建与增进以外，他一概无关。
    事实上，赵曾钰只“重建”了不法与“增进”了屠杀！
    对谋杀者将要复仇
    上海科学工作者协会执行委员会（钟君为会员之一）决定抗议钟泉周的被谋杀。不过，恐怕这样的抗议报上不会登出来，他们就写了一封信慰问钟君家属。据说上海、北大、清华、南开联大校友会，联名发表了宣言抗议。
    这里（指香港）的反应，不及廿一日晚中共广播中北平各界的反应那么明确有力。公共汽车公司现在已经复工了，作为纠纷焦点的紧急补助虽然目前已无人敢公开再谈，报纸上也没有发表纪念这一事件的文章。罪犯们正和他们的同谋者暗自高兴把工人纠纷压制了下去了，但是，在血腥的压力底下，每一个有良心的人的心里已种下了憎恨，人民望着北方，相信惩办战争罪犯的日子是近了。
