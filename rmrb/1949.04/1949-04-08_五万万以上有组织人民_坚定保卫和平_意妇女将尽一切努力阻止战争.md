"In view of the great danger threatening peace, the Preparatory Committee calls on all Germans to participate in this movement, strengthen it, and expand it. We appeal to the conscience of all Germans: unite in the great German movement for peace, just as people all over the world are united in the World Congress of Supporters of Peace to be held in Paris. Nothing is more indispensable and vital to our people than peace. We will hold mass rallies throughout Germany when the World Congress of Supporters of Peace is held in Paris and act in unison with peace defenders around the world."

The Congress called on all organizations of the Women's League to hold meetings, establish peace committees, and elect representatives to attend the World Congress of Supporters of Peace. The Congress passed a letter to Truman, pointing out that the North Atlantic Treaty violates the people's desire for peace and the principle of collective security. It also said that Italian women will do everything possible to prevent the occurrence of a world war. The slogan at the end of the letter was "Down with the North Atlantic Treaty."
