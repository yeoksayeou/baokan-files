　　Celebrating the Opening of the Paris World Peace Congress
    Today, the World Peace Congress held in Paris opens. This is a great review of the peace forces of democratic people all over the world. Our Chinese people, in response to the call of the Congress, have sent a delegation to attend. We congratulate the opening of the Congress and wish it success.
    The force represented by the Paris Congress is the force formed by the great will of the people of all countries and all nations against war. It is a sign of the growing strength of the world anti-imperialist democratic camp led by the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries. The Congress brings together representatives of workers, peasants, youth, women, scientists, cultural figures, artists, and religious figures from various countries, representing not only the people of the socialist Soviet Union, the new democracies of Eastern Europe, and China, but also the people of imperialist countries and the oppressed nations in various colonies and semi-colonies. This lineup appears infinitely more powerful than the handful of diplomatic representatives of the US, British, and French imperialists and their vassal states who signed the North Atlantic Treaty in Washington two weeks ago, headed by US imperialist elements.
    The Paris Congress will discuss resolving international disputes through negotiations, opposing the insane expansion of armaments, opposing the obstruction of normal economic relations between countries, respecting the independence and sovereignty of all countries, and establishing a permanent world organization to implement the decisions of the Congress, and then having the delegations from various countries bring the decisions of the Congress back to their own countries to establish branches to defend peace. The Congress will make the already existing peace camp a more organized and powerful force, a global standing force for the defense of peace.
    Increasingly serious economic and political crises exist within the entire imperialist camp. The reactionaries, headed by US imperialism, vainly attempt to find a way out of the crisis through war. Therefore, the danger of war exists. But the danger of war can be overcome. This depends on the united and continuous struggle of the peace-loving people of the world. The Paris Congress is a clarion call and a tremendous impetus for the world's peace forces.
    Entrusted by the Chinese people, the Chinese delegation traveled more than 9,000 kilometers, bringing the voice of the Chinese people to the meeting, and working with delegations from various countries to jointly devote themselves to the cause of defending peace. The Chinese delegation will tell the Congress with its own glorious experience of struggle: US imperialism is not to be feared, it is just a paper tiger, and the victorious liberation war of the Chinese people has already pierced it; we believe that the war danger created by imperialism can be overcome, and any plan of aggression can be completely smashed; the aggressive forces of US imperialism in China and its agents—the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary clique—are obstacles to China's peace. Now, this obstacle has been overcome by the Chinese people, and its remaining forces will soon be eliminated, thereby enabling China to achieve true peace, which is a major contribution to world peace. The Chinese people deeply feel that the US imperialism's support for reactionary forces in China, the establishment of military bases, and the fostering of the revival of Japanese aggressive forces in China's neighbors are not only infringements on China's national sovereignty and threats to peace in the Far East, but also endanger world peace. The United States and other aggressive countries are attempting to create a Pacific Pact based on the model of the North Atlantic Treaty. The Chinese people are vigilantly watching this development and bringing to the Paris Congress our determination to work hard to destroy this evil conspiracy, so that the people of all countries can unanimously smash the US imperialist war plan. As declared in the joint statement of all democratic parties in China: "If the imperialist aggressive bloc dares to provoke this reactionary war that endangers the people of the world, then we will unite the people of the whole country, abide by Mr. Sun Yat-sen's immortal will, adopt necessary methods, and join hands with China's allies, the Soviet Union, and the peace-loving and democratic forces of various countries to resolutely fight the instigators of aggressive war, defeat the aggressors, overthrow the entire imperialist system, and realize the liberation of all mankind and permanent peace."
    News has come that the reactionary French government, acting on the orders of its American masters, is obstructing delegations from China and other countries from entering Paris. This shameful act is a manifestation of the cowardice of the warmongers. The democratic parties and people's organizations of China, the people of various countries, and the organizing committee of the Paris Congress have already lodged angry protests against this unreasonable action. However, although this shameful action by the French government can hinder the entry of a few representatives, it can never hinder the victorious advance of the great world people's movement for peace.

### 庆祝巴黎世界拥护和平大会开幕

　　庆祝巴黎世界拥护和平大会开幕
    今天，在巴黎举行的世界拥护和平大会开幕了。这是全世界民主人民和平力量的大检阅。我们中国人民响应大会的号召，派遣了代表团前往出席。我们庆贺大会开幕，并预祝大会的成功。
    巴黎大会所代表的力量是一切国家和一切民族的人民反对战争的伟大意志所结成的力量。它是以苏联和人民民主国家为首的世界反帝国主义民主阵营愈益壮大的标志。大会集合了各国工人的、农民的、青年的、妇女的、科学家的、文化界的、艺术界的和宗教界的代表，不仅代表着社会主义国家苏联、东欧新民主主义国家和中国的人民，而且代表着帝国主义国家的人民和各殖民地、半殖民地的被压迫民族。这个阵容，比起以美帝国主义分子为首的战争贩子集团；比起两星期以前在华盛顿签订北大西洋公约的美英法帝国主义及其附庸国家的一小撮外交代表来，显得无比的强大。
    巴黎大会所要讨论的是以谈判方式解决国际纠纷，反对疯狂的扩充军备，反对阻隔各国之间的正常经济关系，尊重各国的独立主权，以及建立一个世界性的常设机构，执行大会的决定，然后再由各国代表团把大会的决定带回本国去，建立保卫和平的分支机构。大会将使早已存在的和平阵营成为一支更加有组织的强大力量，一支全球性的保卫和平的常备部队。
    整个帝国主义国家内部都存在着日益严重的经济危机和政治危机。以美帝国主义为首的反动派妄想从战争中寻找逃出危机的道路。因此，战争的危险是存在的。但是战争的危险是可以克服的。这要依靠世界爱好和平的人民团结一致，不断奋斗。巴黎大会就是世界和平力量的一个号角，一个巨大的推动力。
    中国代表团受到中国人民的付托，远涉九千公里以上的路程，把中国人民的声音带到会上，与各国代表团通力合作，共同致力保卫和平的事业。中国代表团将以自己的光辉斗争的经验告诉大会：美帝国主义是不可怕的，它不过是一只纸老虎，中国人民的胜利的解放战争已经把它戳穿了；我们相信帝国主义制造的战争危险是可以克服的，任何侵略计划是完全可以粉碎的；美帝国主义在中国的侵略势力及其代理人——蒋介石反动集团是中国和平的障碍，现在，这个障碍已被中国人民所战胜了，它的残余力量也即将被肃清，从而使中国实现真正的和平，这是对于世界和平的一个重大的贡献。中国人民深刻地感到美帝国主义在中国扶植反动势力，建立军事基地，以及在中国近邻扶植日本侵略势力的复活，不只是对中国国家主权的侵害，对远东和平的威胁，而且也危害着世界和平。美国和其他侵略国家正在企图依照北大西洋公约的模型，塑造一个太平洋公约。中国人民正在警惕地注视着这一发展，并且把我们努力摧毁这一罪恶阴谋的决心，带给巴黎大会，以便各国人民一致粉碎美帝国主义的战争计划。正如中国各民主党派联合声明中所宣告的：“如果帝国主义侵略集团竟敢挑动这个危害全世界人民的反动的战争，那么我们将团结全国人民，遵守孙中山先生的不朽遗嘱，采用必要的方法，与中国的盟友苏联和各国和平民主势力，携手并进，向侵略战争的发动者作坚决的斗争，打败侵略者，推翻整个帝国主义制度，实现全人类的解放和永久的和平。”
    消息传来，法国反动政府奉其美国主子之命，正在阻挠中国和其他国家的代表团进入巴黎。这种可耻的行动，是战争贩子胆怯的表现。中国各民主党派、各人民团体、各国人民与巴黎大会筹委会一起，对于此种无理行动已经提出了愤怒的抗议。但是，法国政府这种可耻的行动虽能阻挠几个代表的入境，却决不能阻挠伟大的世界人民争取和平运动的胜利前进。
