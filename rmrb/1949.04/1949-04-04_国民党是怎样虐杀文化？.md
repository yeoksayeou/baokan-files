　　How Does the Kuomintang Abuse and Murder Culture?
       He Jiahuai
    The Kuomintang reactionaries have always opposed progress, destroyed culture, and hated intellectuals. Since the start of the Huaihai Campaign, the collapse of the Kuomintang reactionary group has become increasingly obvious. Therefore, the oppression they exert on the cultural sphere has become even more frantic.
    The most favored means of destruction they employ is, of course, to directly and swiftly close bookstores, confiscate books and periodicals, and arrest, imprison, and murder progressive cultural workers. Taking Shanghai as an example, newer bookstores can no longer exist. "Life," "New Knowledge," and "Reading Life Publishing House" first ended their storefronts, then canceled their offices, and finally, even places for consignment sales or distribution disappeared. All of these were said to be "voluntary," but in fact, they were completely forced to close down. Because if they did not "voluntarily" close down early, Kuomintang secret agents would immediately smash these bookstores entirely, search them completely, and arrest the office staff and shop assistants. Other bookstores simply did not dare to publish progressive books and periodicals, otherwise they would definitely suffer unbearable persecution and irreparable losses. The "Liqun United Publishing House" printing factory was searched more than once, and many workers and staff were arrested. Even people who bought books at its storefront were often searched and arrested. Mr. Lao Xing, a young writer dedicated to literary criticism, was kidnapped by Kuomintang Military Intelligence Bureau personnel while buying books at Qunyi. After being kidnapped, his family took a long time to find out his whereabouts, but the Kuomintang authorities did not allow them to visit him, nor were they allowed to send bedding, clothing, and food. Even a public trial was not held, only repeated torture was inflicted in private. He had several young children, and their life was hopeless. His wife was also very weak. Since I left Shanghai, I have not heard any news from them. Thinking about it really makes people sad and indignant.
    Most of the newspapers in Shanghai are in the hands of the Kuomintang, and what they do is nothing more than spreading rumors every day. Since the "Wenhui Daily" was suspended, there was basically no readable newspaper except for the "Times Daily," which was run by Shanghainese merchants. Finally, even the "Times Daily" was forced to suspend publication. Of course, newspapers from the liberated areas were not seen at all: Hong Kong newspapers were also prohibited, and the "Huashang Bao" and "Wenhui Daily" (moved from Shanghai to Hong Kong) were absolutely not allowed to be imported. There were originally very few progressive publications in Shanghai. Before I left Shanghai, they were especially pitiful. "Shi Yu Wen" was forced to suspend publication, "Reading and Publishing" also died prematurely, "Outlook" was precarious, and "World Knowledge" was repeatedly oppressed. Other publications that had nothing to do with the Kuomintang reactionaries, such as "Wenxun," "Open-Minded Juvenile," and "Middle School Students," were all trembling with fear, afraid of getting into trouble. In terms of literature and art, purely literary and artistic publications were especially scarce. The journal of the National Association of Literary and Art Circles of China, "Chinese Writer," only published three issues, "Literary and Art New Collection" only published one issue, "Literary Renaissance," "Wenxun's" special literary issue, and several poetry publications were all fraught with disasters. The literary supplement of the "Times Daily" died with the newspaper's suspension. It can be seen that the Kuomintang's reactionary tentacles are all-pervasive, and they attempt to turn the cultural garden into a wasteland.
    The Kuomintang's bloody hands often seek out targets for slaughter among progressive cultural workers. The blacklist they prepared almost included all cultural figures who were unwilling to throw themselves into the arms of the Kuomintang and act as its tools. Even writers like Mr. Ye Shengtao, who did not often concern themselves with foreign affairs, were actually included on the blacklist. Other people are at risk of losing their lives anytime and anywhere. Before I left Shanghai, the White Terror in Shanghai became more and more severe. Some friends tried to go north, but most went south to Hong Kong. Even those who could not move for the time being moved and closed their doors to guests. But even so, they could not guarantee their safety or escape the tracking and persecution of secret agents. Mr. Yang Hui's home was searched immediately after he went to Hong Kong. After Mr. Xia Kangnong left home, secret agents visited. Professors and teachers in Shanghai universities and middle schools who did not usually echo the so-called "Suppression of Rebellion Mobilization" in the Kuomintang cultural and educational circles did not dare to live in the schools. Even more students went missing and were harmed for no reason.
    In addition to bloody destruction, the Kuomintang also attempted to implement a despicable policy of bribery and intimidation by various means. They wanted to buy off "Shi Yu Wen" (it was ordered to suspend publication because the bribery was ineffective) and "Outlook." They also repeatedly warned and threatened international affairs publications like "World Knowledge," repeatedly concocting charges in an effort to force it to suspend publication.
    Another method is to control newspapers, prevent distribution, and force you to "voluntarily" suspend publication or shelve it indefinitely. This is an extremely vicious policy of strangling culture, a policy of killing people without seeing blood, which is sometimes more severe than not allowing registration or direct persecution. Because the reactionary group has completely controlled white paper, more progressive bookstores and publishers are naturally not allocated white paper at all, and they have no choice but to seek it from the black market, which is an extremely heavy burden, and no bureaucratic capital bookstore or publisher has such great power to support it. The Kuomintang used this method to ruin countless bookstores and publishers, and bury countless progressive books and newspapers. Taking my personal experience as an example, I translated "Two Hundred Years of Leap Forward," originally titled "The People Who Built Stalingrad," part of the Soviet "History of Factories." It was first introduced by Mr. Mao Dun to the Dadi Bookstore to be included in the "Datong Literary Series" he and several others co-edited, but it was shelved due to the bookstore's lack of white paper and business losses. The second time it was introduced by Mr. Chen Yuan to the Gengyun Publishing House, it was also aborted because the allocation of white paper was canceled. Of course, more important losses than this are too numerous to calculate.
    The censorship system, which was once superficially abolished, has actually been restored long ago. Some bookstores have to go through several inspections and several gates guarded by Kuomintang censors or their representatives to publish a book or magazine, or to publish an article. As a result of the review, even if the original manuscript is not completely confiscated, it is often truncated and unrecognizable.
    In addition, there are economic difficulties and the oppression of life. We know that the people in the Jiang-controlled areas are subjected to the exploitation and blackmail of the reactionary class every day by means of inflation and exorbitant taxes. The suffering of life has reached its extreme, and cultural workers are naturally no exception. For example, in October last year, the price of rice was two yuan per catty (counterfeit gold yuan coupons), but by the time the manuscript fee was received, it had risen to more than 20 yuan per catty in just a few days. Therefore, the manuscript fee, which was originally expected to buy eight or nine catties of rice, ended up not being able to buy even one catty of rice. You see this situation, how can a literary worker maintain the life of a family of several people? Moreover, books published in Shanghai used to be printed in thousands of copies, but later they shrunk to only one thousand copies, and being able to sell a few hundred copies was considered a great fortune, and royalties were even more difficult to receive on time. In this situation, what way is there for writers to avoid starving to death? Therefore, in the Kuomintang areas, friends who engage in writing cannot survive unless they also work as teachers or do other jobs. They are either struggling desperately on the verge of starvation every day, or they are suffering from illness all year round due to overwork. Mr. Zhang Tianyi and Ms. Bai Wei both suffer from severe lung disease, Mr. Sha Ting is also bedridden, and Mr. Gao Shiqi can hardly live, let alone receive treatment.
    In short, under the rule of the Kuomintang, the cultural world has become a wasteland and a blank sheet of paper. Shanghai (which was originally the center of culture) is like this, and other places are even more so. This is because the reactionary group headed by Chiang Kai-shek is fundamentally anti-progressive and anti-cultural. These bandits think about nothing but how to abuse and murder culture and persecute intellectuals, so that they can more smoothly carry out their fascist policy of anesthetizing, deceiving, persecuting, and slaughtering the broad masses of people. This is in stark contrast to the situation in the liberated areas.
    This time, I escaped from Shanghai in the White Terror, went through all kinds of hardships, and finally arrived safely in the Central Plains. The heartfelt joy is really indescribable. But now that the reactionary remnants have not been completely eliminated, there are still many friends in the cultural world who are still groaning under the dark rule, and even breathing is impossible. Therefore, just to save Chinese culture, it is also necessary to promote the early liberation of the whole country. This is the main motivation and hope for me to write this short article.

　　国民党是怎样虐杀文化？
       何家槐
    国民党反动派是一向反对进步，摧毁文化，仇视知识分子的。在淮海战役开始以后，国民党反动集团的崩溃日益明显，因此对于文化界所施的压迫，也更其疯狂了。
    他们最爱采用的摧残手段，自然是直截痛快地关闭书店，查封书刊，逮捕、监禁和杀害进步的文化工作者。以上海来说，较新的书店早已不能存在，“生活”、“新知”、和“读书生活出版社”开始是结束门市部，以后是取消办事处，最后连代售或分销的地方也不见了。这些说起来都是“自动”的，事实上都是完全被迫停业，因为如果不趁早“自动”结束，国民党特务分子就马上会把这些书店整个捣毁，全部抄查，并把办事人员和店伙捕去。其他书店根本不敢出版进步书刊，否则一定会遭到不能忍受的迫害，无法弥补的损失，“利群联合出版社”印刷所，就曾经不止一次地受到抄查，被逮捕了好多工友和职员，连在它的门市部买书的人也常常遭受搜查和逮捕。致力文艺批评的青年作家劳辛先生，就是群益买书给国民党军统局人员绑走的。绑去以后，他的家属很久才打听到他的下落，但是国民党当局，不准他们探视，也不准送被褥、衣服和食物，连公开的审问都没有举行过，只是一味的私刑拷打。他有好几个小孩，生活毫无办法，他的夫人身体也很衰弱。我离开上海以后就一直没有听到他们的消息，不知道是死是活，想起来真是使人悲愤。
    上海的报纸，大部分都是在国民党手里，所干的行当，无非是天天造谣。自从“文汇报”停刊以后，除了苏商办的“时代日报”，根本没有一份可看的报，最后连“时代日报”也被迫停刊。解放区的报纸当然根本看不到：香港的报纸亦遭禁止，“华商报”，“文汇报”（由上海迁移香港）绝对不准进口。上海的进步刊物本来很少，在我离开上海以前，尤其少得可怜，“时与文”被迫停刊了，“读书与出版”也中途夭折了，“展望”风雨飘摇，“世界知识”屡受压迫，其他和国民党反动派没有关系的刊物如“文讯”，“开明少年”，“中学生”等，也无不战战兢兢，生怕出事。在文艺方面，纯文艺的刊物尤其稀少，中华全国文艺协会总会的会刊“中国作家”只出了三期，“文艺新辑”只出了一期，“文艺复兴”、“文讯”的文艺专号、以及几个诗歌刊物都是灾难重重，“时代日报”的文艺副刊因为报纸停刊而随着夭折。可见国民党的反动触角，是无孔不入，他们企图把文化园地变成一片荒芜。
    国民党的血手，更常常在进步的文化工作者中找寻屠杀的对象。他们所准备的黑名单，差不多网罗了一切不愿投入国民党怀抱替它当工具的文化界人士。就是象叶圣陶先生那样的不常过问外事的作家，也居然被列入黑名单。其他人士更随时随地都有丧失生命的危险。我离沪以前，上海的白色恐怖越来越厉害，一部分朋友设法北上，但大部分朋友则南下香港。即使一时无法走动的，也纷纷迁居，杜门谢客。但就是这样，也还不能保证生命的安全，不能逃避特务的追踪和迫害。杨晦先生刚去香港，家里即遭受搜查。夏康农先生离家之后，就有特务去光顾，上海各大学和各中学的教授和教员只要平日不随声附和，参加国民党文化教育界的所谓“戡乱动员”的，也都不敢在学校里住宿。学生无故失踪遭害的更多。
    除了血腥的摧残以外，国民党也企图以各种方法，实行收买和恐吓的卑劣政策。他们想收买“时与文”（因收买无效，才勒令停刊）和“展望”；对于象“世界知识”这样的国际问题刊物，也加以屡次警告，一再威胁，极力罗辑罪名，务使停刊而后快。
    另一个办法，就是控制的报纸，阻止发行，逼迫你“自动”停刊或无期搁浅。这是一种极毒辣的、杀人不见血的绞杀文化的政策，有时比不准登记或直接迫害更其厉害。因为反动集团既把白报纸完全控制在手里，比较进步的书店和出版社，自然根本配给不到白报纸，势不得不求之于黑市场，而这是沉重无比的负担，并非官僚资本的书店和出版社，哪里有这么大的力量支持呢？国民党用这方法，不知搞垮了多少书店和出版社，埋没了多少进步的书报。拿我亲身的经历说，我翻译过一本“跃进二百年”原名“建设史达林格拉的人们”，为苏联“工厂史”的一部分，第一次由茅盾先生介绍给大地书室编入他和其他几个人共同主编的“大同文艺丛书”，因书店缺乏白报纸和营业亏损而中途搁置。第二次由陈原先生介绍耕耘出版社，也因白报纸配给被取消而中途流产。当然比这更重要的损失，是多得无法计算的。
    曾经表面上一度取消的审查制度实际上早已恢复了。有些书店要想出版一本书或者一个杂志，要想发表一篇文章，都得经过几次检查，通过几重由国民党大小审查官或其代表人把守的鬼门关。审查的结果，即使不是原稿完全被没收，也往往被截头断尾，体无完肤，根本不象个样子。
    此外还有经济的困难和生活的压迫。我们知道在蒋管区的人民，天天遭受反动阶级以通货膨胀及苛捐杂税等项方法所施行的剥削和敲诈，生活的痛苦已达极点，文化界工作者自然不能例外。例如去年十月间，那时米价是每斤二圆（伪金圆券），但待到拿到稿费，只不过几天功夫，就一涨涨到二十多元一斤了。因此原来预计可以买八九斤米的稿费，结果却是一斤米也买不到。你看这种情形，一个文艺工作者怎能维持一家数口的生活呢？而且，上海出版的书籍，过去一印就是几千份，但以后却萎缩到只印一千份，能售几百份已算万幸，版税更不易按时拿到，象这种情形，作家不饿死又有什么办法呢？因此在国民党区，从事写作的朋友如不兼做教员或兼做其他工作，就都不能过。不是天天在饥饿线上拼命挣扎，就是因为辛劳过度，终年都在病痛中过日。张天翼先生和白薇女士，都害着极重的肺病，沙汀先生也在卧病中，高士奇先生几乎无法生活，更没有办法进行疗治。
    总之，在国民党统治之下，文化界已经成了一片荒芜和一张白纸。上海（这本来是文化的中心）如此，其他各地更是如此。这是因为以蒋介石为首的反动集团根本是反进步、反文化的。这些匪徒天天所想的就是如何来虐杀文化，迫害知识分子，使他们得以更顺利地进行麻醉欺骗，迫害和屠戮广大人民的法西斯政策，这和解放区的情形，恰恰是一个极鲜明的对照。
    这次我于白色恐怖中逃出上海，历尽了千辛万苦，总算平安地到达了中原，衷心的愉快实在难以形容。但如今反动的残余势力尚未肃清，还有多少文化界的朋友依然辗转呻吟在黑暗的统治下面，连喘息也不可能。因此仅仅为了挽救中国的文化，也需要促成全国的早日解放。这是我写这篇短文的主要动机和希望。
