Criticism and Suggestions

　　Harassing Passengers by Refusing Small Denomination Bills
　　Yuci North Station Should Be Investigated
　　To the Comrade Editor:
　　I have a suggestion: The ticket office at Yuci North Station on the Zhengtai Railway has a terrible work style. On the 25th of last month, it was drizzling, and there were particularly many people buying tickets (mostly farmers and peddlers), but the ticket office deliberately made things difficult for passengers: refusing to accept small denomination bills, finding it troublesome, and only accepting RMB or Ji banknotes in denominations of 1,000 yuan or more. But where would the passengers get that from? When the villagers pleaded nicely, they were even beaten by the railway protection team. As a result, many people were unable to get on the train. I personally saw an old woman so distressed that she left crying. Therefore, I suggest that the responsible comrades at the station should conduct a strict investigation and correction, and educate their personnel.

### 刁难旅客不收零票　榆次北车站应检查

　　刁难旅客不收零票
  　榆次北车站应检查编者同志
    我有个意见：正太路榆次北车站票房作风恶劣。上月二十五日，天下小雨，买票的人特别多（多是农民和小贩），但票房却故意刁难旅客：不收零票，嫌麻烦，只收人民币或冀钞千元以上的。但旅客那里有呢？老乡说好话，还被护路队打了。所以很多人没能上车。我亲眼见到一个老大娘难为得哭着走了。因此我建议，该站负责同志应进行严格检查、纠正，对其人员进行教育。
