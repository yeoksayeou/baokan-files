　　Stone Steel Plant Pseudo-Trade Union Commits Heinous Crimes
  　Workers Demand Investigation of Chief Culprits
    [Ping City News] The pseudo-trade union of the Stone Steel Plant was a well-known Kuomintang secret agent organization. Before liberation, relying on the power of the pseudo-municipal party headquarters of Beiping outside the factory, and on hooligan groups inside the factory, they oppressed workers, embezzled and extorted, stole public property, conscripted soldiers, and beat workers. They arbitrarily "exposed" workers, acted tyrannically, and did all kinds of evil. All the workers in the factory cursed them. After liberation, Hu Dianchen (chairman of the pseudo-trade union), attempted to continue his activities and has been detained by the Stone Public Security Bureau for investigation. It has also been found that pseudo-trade union directors Xing Shikuan, Ni Cailin and others conspired to embezzle 14,400 jin of relief grain allocated by the People's Government, which they have admitted to. In addition, Xue Yushu, Gao Yonggui and others had served as members of the Kuomintang 39th District Party Committee's Anti-Communist Committee, and Zheng Jingchen had worked as a special agent for the Kuomintang Central Bureau of Statistics, organizing intelligence work against the Communist Party and the people in various factories and departments. After liberation, they went into hiding, attempting to carry out secret activities. Based on the above facts, the administrative side of the Stone Steel Plant has decided to suspend Xing Shikuan, Dou Jingshan, Ge Xingwu and others from their original positions and keep them under observation in the factory. The workers unanimously support this administrative measure. At the workers' congress of the plant on the 15th of this month, it was unanimously decided to ask the Public Security Bureau to be responsible for investigating the crimes of Xing Shikuan and others.

　　石景山钢铁厂伪工会罪恶累累
  　职工要求查办首恶
    【平市讯】石景山钢铁厂的伪工会是一个有名的国民党特务组织。解放前，他们在厂外倚仗着北平伪市党部的势力，厂内凭借着流氓集团、欺压职工、贪污勒索、盗卖公物、抓壮丁、打工人，任意“检举”工人，横行霸道，无恶不做，全厂职工没有不咒骂他们的。解放后，胡殿宸（伪工会理事长），企图继续活动，已由石景山公安局扣押究办，并查出伪工会理事邢士宽、倪才林等共谋贪污人民政府拨发的救济粮一四四○○斤，经承认不讳。另薛玉书、高永贵等都曾任国民党三十九区党委清共委员会委员，郑景臣曾给国民党中统局当特务，组织各厂处反共反人民的情报工作，解放后潜伏隐匿，企图进行秘密活动。根据上面的事实，石景山钢铁厂行政方面决定停止邢士宽、窦景山、葛兴五等的原有职务，留厂察看。对于行政上的这一措施，职工们都一致拥护。本月十五日该厂职工大会上，一致决定请公安局负责查办邢士宽等的罪恶。
