　　State-Owned Farm Cooperates with Farmers
  　Reclaims 30 Hectares of Wasteland in Suburban Plains
  　Using Tractors for Large-Scale Operation
    [This Newspaper's Report] The Ping Municipal Nanyuan State-Owned Farm is cooperating with farmers from villages such as Wudian to cultivate 30 hectares of fertile land, formerly wasteland abandoned by the Japanese and puppet regimes, using tractors. Under the leadership of village cadres, the villages are actively forming groups to cultivate collectively and have already begun sowing cotton. Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Kuomintang had opened up dozens of hectares of fertile land in the area to build an airfield. The Japanese invaders then built oil and ammunition depots there. After the victory of the War of Resistance, the Kuomintang bandit troops used the excuse of "guarding" the area to continue to leave it deserted. After liberation, the People's Government decided to cooperate with nearby farmers to manage it and proposed six measures: 1. The purpose of the cooperation is to eliminate wasteland and increase production, with priority given to poor and landless laboring farmers in nearby villages who have labor power but no land. 2. The method of cooperation is to lease the state-owned land to farmers, who will sow, hoe, weed, and harvest, with dividends distributed according to regulations after the autumn harvest, after the land is plowed and harrowed by tractor. 3. The principle of dividend distribution is to ensure that farmers benefit and that tractors can continue to develop. It is stipulated that an average yield of 30 jin of cotton per mu and an average yield of 2 dou of corn per mu will be used to cover tractor fuel, depreciation, and other expenses. If the harvest is poor due to the year's weather conditions, the amount may be reduced appropriately. Those who work hard in weeding and fertilizing and produce more will not be charged more. 4. Planting should be unified as much as possible, that is, planting as much cotton as possible. If other crops are planted, it must be approved by the state-owned farm. In order to maintain pure strains, cotton seeds will be lent out by the state and returned according to regulations after the autumn harvest. If the farm needs cotton seeds or seed cotton, it has priority at the same market price. 5. In order to maximize the role of the tools, the land should be operated in large blocks, and organized as much as possible. At the very least, it cannot affect the work of the tractors. 6. All those who borrow land must establish production teams, led by the team leader, to ensure that the land is well cultivated. Each village selects a general representative from among the farming households to be led by the farm and jointly responsible for technical guidance and production inspection. After these measures were announced, the masses responded very well, so many people wanted to farm the land. In order to allocate it carefully, after each village reported, the farmers' association drafted, the district cadres reviewed, and the masses finally approved, a total of 346 farmers from seven villages, including Jiugong, Wudian, and Nanchang, were allocated 30 hectares. The remaining land (including buildings and roads) is directly managed by the government. Throughout the entire work process, the education of becoming rich through production was implemented, and the masses were also organized in various ways to visit the actual effectiveness of tractor cultivation, so the masses' enthusiasm was extremely high. The masses in Nanchang Village put forward the slogan "Even though everyone is very difficult, we must find ways to send fertilizer." The cadres of Wudian Village guaranteed that there would not be a single weed in the land. Each village filled in the battle fortifications in the allocated land and cleared the scattered artillery shells, barbed wire, and other debris, so the tractor cultivation was relatively smooth.

　　国营农场与农民合作
  　开垦平郊荒地卅顷
  　使用拖拉机大块经营
    【本报讯】平市南苑国营农场，与庑甸等村农民合作经营，用拖拉机开垦原为日伪荒芜的良田三十顷，各村在村干部领导下，纷纷结合小组，集体伙种，现已开始点种棉花。按抗战前国民党曾在该地开辟了数十顷地之大的良田作飞机场，日寇在此又曾建油弹库，抗战胜利后，国民党匪军借口“警戒”此地仍然荒废，解放后，人民政府决定与近地农民合作经营，并提出六条办法：一、合作目的是为消灭荒地，增加生产，附近村庄有劳力而没有土地的贫苦劳动农民有优先权。二、合作办法是把国有土地分借予农民，由拖拉机耕耙，农民下种、锄、耘、收割，秋后照规定分红。三、分红原则是保证农民有利，拖拉机也能继续发展，规定每亩棉花平均收三十斤，每亩玉米平均收三斗，以此作为拖拉机耗油折旧等开支。如因年景歉收，可酌情减少，锄耘施肥努力而多产者亦不多收。四、种植上要求统一，即尽量多种棉花。如种其他，须经国营农场批准。为了保持纯种。棉籽由公家统一贷发，秋后照规定归还；农场如需要棉籽或籽棉，同等市价有优先权。五、为了发挥工具作用，土地要求大块经营，尽可能的组织起来，最低限度也不能影响拖拉机工作。六、凡借地人须成立生产小组，由组长领导，保证把地种好。每村在种地户中，选一总代表受农场领导，共同负责技术指导、生产检查。这办法宣布后，群众反映很好，所以要求种地的人极多。为了慎重分配，经各村自报、农会起草、区干部审查、群众最后通过后，计九宫、庑甸、南昌等七村、三百四十六户农民共分种三十顷，其余土地（包括建筑物及道路）由政府直接经营。在整个工作的进程中，贯彻了生产致富的教育，同时又多方组织群众参观拖拉机耕地实际效能，所以群众情绪极高。南昌村群众提出“虽然大家很困难，也要设法送粪”的口号。庑甸村干部保证不让地内有一棵草。各村把分到的地里的作战工事，都填平了，满地零乱的炮弹头、铁丝网等也清理了，因之拖拉机耕作比较顺利。（王大明、马鹏云）
