　　Baxian Loans Grain to Dig 30 Wells
　　Eight Hundred Qing of Land Irrigated Underground
　　[JiZhong News] In Baxian, along the northern bank of the Daqing River, over eight hundred qing of irrigated land has completed sowing, and further water conservancy construction is underway. Last winter, Baxian opened canals. The first, second, and seventh districts, comprising twenty-one villages, utilized irrigated land, irrigating 84,000 mu, and have completed sowing with early-maturing crops such as barley, spring wheat, "79 wheat," and peas. This can compensate for the shortage of wheat this year and the insufficient autumn harvest last year. To solve the difficulties faced by impoverished military families in irrigated land villages in sowing, the government issued 34,081 jin of barley, spring wheat, and pea seed loans, benefiting 923 impoverished military households, enabling them to sow 2,717 mu. Seven livestock were loaned to twenty-five impoverished military households in five villages for shared use.
　　[Another Dispatch] The Baxian County Government loaned 1,560 jin of corn to help Yuan Kou in the first district build a new water gate, capable of irrigating over a thousand mu. Among them, one qing of large field has been turned into garden land, thanks to the diligent assistance of a certain battalion of the 46th Army stationed in Northeast China.
　　[Another Dispatch] Baxian loaned 6,118 jin of corn for well-digging grain. Ten brick wells (capable of using waterwheels) and twenty earthen wells are planned to be built to solve the difficulties of planting cotton due to drought. (Qí Xīn)

　　霸县贷粮打井卅眼
  　八百顷水地下种
    【冀中讯】霸县沿大清河北岸，八百余顷水浇地，已完成播种，并进一步建设水利。霸县去冬开渠，利用水浇地的有一、二、七三个区，二十一个村，浇地八万四千亩，已完成了播种，种上了大麦、春麦、“七九麦”、豌豆等早熟作物。这样可以补助今年麦子少和去秋减收之不足。为了解决水浇地村庄贫苦军属播种的困难，政府发放了大麦、春麦、豌豆贷种三万四千零八十一斤，贷款九百二十三户贫苦军属，能播种两千七百一十七亩。七个牲口贷给五个村二十五户贫苦军属伙用。
    【又讯】霸县县政府贷玉米一千五百六十斤，帮助一区苑口新建水闸一个，能浇地千余亩，其中一顷大田变成了园子地，这是在东北驻军四十六军某营努力帮助下成功的。
    【又讯】霸县贷打井粮玉米六千一百一十八斤。计修砖井十眼（能按水车），土井二十眼，解决天旱种棉困难。　　（齐心）
