Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 27th: The All-China Federation of Trade Unions and sixteen other people's organizations recently issued a circular protesting the British warship's violation of Chinese sovereignty by entering the People's Liberation Army (PLA) defense zone and shelling PLA positions. The full text of the telegram is as follows:

　　At a time when the People's Liberation Army is advancing on orders, crossing the Yangtze River to finally eliminate the remnant forces of the Kuomintang reactionary rule that openly refuse to sign the domestic peace agreement, British imperialists have actually dispatched warships to enter the PLA defense zone and bombard PLA positions, causing 252 casualties among PLA commanders and fighters. This atrocity by British imperialists, which violates Chinese sovereignty and openly participates in the Kuomintang reactionaries' opposition to the Chinese people's civil war, cannot but arouse the infinite indignation of the Chinese people. We lodge a serious protest against this provocative act by the British imperialists. We warn the British imperialists that if they dare to continue this act of violating Chinese sovereignty and antagonizing the Chinese people, they will inevitably suffer resolute and just resistance from the Chinese people and suffer a shameful defeat. We believe that this sinful act by the British imperialists is against the will of the British people; the British people will certainly stand with us, the Chinese people, to oppose the British imperialists' policy of aggression, work together, and strive to defend world peace.

　　All-China Federation of Trade Unions, China Liberated Areas Youth Federation, All-China Students' Federation, All-China Democratic Women's Federation, China Association of Scientific Workers, All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, North China Literary and Art Circles Association, Chinese Association of Academic Workers, China Liberated Areas Journalists Association, China Youth Journalists Society, Shanghai People's Organizations Joint Conference, Peking University Professors' Association, Tsinghua University Professors' Association, Yenching University Professors' Association, Normal University Professors' Association, Preparatory Committee of the United Association of Primary and Secondary School Teachers and Staff in Peiping.

　　全国总工会等十六人民团体
  　抗议英舰暴行
    警告英帝如敢继续挑衅必遭中国人民正义抗击
    【新华社北平二十七日电】中华全国总工会等十六个人民团体顷发表通电抗议英国军舰侵犯中国主权，驶入人民解放军防区，并炮轰解放军阵地。该电全文如下：
    正当人民解放军奉命进军、南渡长江、最后消灭公然拒绝签订国内和平协定的国民党反动统治残余势力的时候，英帝国主义者竟派遣军舰驶入解放军防区，并发炮轰击解放军阵地，使解放军指战员伤亡二百五十二人之众。英帝国主义者此种侵犯中国主权、公然参加国民党反动派反对中国人民的内战的暴行，不能不激起中国人民的无限的愤溉。我们对英帝国主义者这种挑衅行为，提出严重抗议。我们警告英帝国主义者，如果它胆敢继续此种侵犯中国主权、与中国人民为敌的行为，必将遭受中国人民坚决地正义抗击，而招致可耻的失败。我们相信，英帝国主义者此种罪恶行为是违反英国人民意志的；英国人民一定和我们中国人民站在一起反对英帝国主义者的侵略政策，携手合作，为保卫世界和平而奋斗。
