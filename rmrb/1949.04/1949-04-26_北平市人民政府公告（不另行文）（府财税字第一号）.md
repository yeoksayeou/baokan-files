Announcement of the Beiping Municipal People's Government (Not Separately Documented) (Fu Cai Shui Zi No. 1)

Regarding the Announcement of the Fixed Salary Income Tax Rate:

Having investigated and determined the fixed salary income tax rate for public education, police personnel, and public and private enterprise employees in this city, the People's Government has decided to commence collection from April of this year. The relevant details and instructions are hereby announced for the information and compliance of all agencies, schools, and public and private enterprises.

1.  Salary income tax will be levied starting from April of this year.

2.  The salary income tax is calculated based on the equivalent amount of millet in jin for each person's monthly salary. It will be collected in currency based on the market price at the time of salary disbursement. If the salary is originally disbursed in currency based on the millet price, the tax amount will be calculated based on the millet price at the time of disbursement.

3.  The provisional tax exemption threshold for salary income tax is 250 jin of millet. Those earning 250 jin or less are exempt from tax. For those earning more than 250 jin, the tax rate will be levied on the excess portion, using a progressive tax rate ranging from 4% to 15%. The tax brackets and calculation formulas are shown in the table below:

    Salary Income (Jin)　　Tax Rate　　Tax Calculation Formula (X = Salary Income)
    251-350 　　4%　　0.04X - 10 jin
    351-450 　　5%　　0.05X - 13.5 jin
    451-600 　　7%　　0.07X - 22.5 jin
    601-750 　　9%　　0.09X - 34.5 jin
    751-900 　　12%　　0.12X - 57 jin
    900 and above　　15%　　0.15X - 84 jin

    Note: 1. Salary income with a fraction of less than one jin will not be taxed.
    	  2. Round to two decimal places.

4.  For employees of public and private enterprises whose food and lodging are provided by the factory or store, the value of the food and lodging will be calculated as 150 jin of millet. Those whose net salary exceeds 100 jin of millet per month will be taxed on the excess portion, with the same tax rates as above.

5.  The salary income tax will be withheld by the disbursing unit at the time of salary payment. Within five days after the salary payment, the withheld taxes should be declared to the Municipal Tax Bureau using the prescribed form. The Tax Bureau will then issue a payment voucher for immediate deposit into the treasury.

    Mayor: Ye Jianying
    Deputy Mayor: Xu Bing
    April 24, 38th Year of the Republic of China
