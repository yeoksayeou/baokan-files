　　【Comprehensive report from this newspaper】The masses in Zhangjiakou, Tangshan, Shijiazhuang, and Chahar Province were ecstatic upon hearing the victorious news of the People's Liberation Army rapidly crossing the Yangtze River and liberating Nanjing. In Zhangjiakou, many factories immediately held meetings to discuss how to support Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu's order with practical actions, so as to take Nanjing and liberate all of China sooner, upon seeing the order from Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu ordering the People's Liberation Army to advance bravely! The Ping-Sui Railway Trade Union convened seventeen units and seventy-seven employee representatives to discuss and propose resolutely completing the support-the-front tasks, ensuring timely operation of vehicles, and striving for a safe speed of 100,000 kilometers. Workers in Tangshan proposed to work hard to produce and support the front, and complete the task of liberating all of China. Yang Songxiang, the group leader of the Chahar Province Electric Power Administration, proposed: complete the installation of the power lines and street lights from Qianningyuan to Shalingzi ahead of schedule. Liu Xingong, the head of the repair team, proposed to install 1,000 households with electric lights from the 18th of this month to the "May Day" festival. The masses in various parts of Chahar Province wrote letters of慰问 to the troops one after another. Students from Xiayongxing Primary School in the Seventh District wrote 31 letters in six days to express sympathy and solicitude to the commanders and fighters on the Taiyuan front. The masses helped the troops build bridges, lead the way, and helped the southward troops to stand guard. They organized sewing teams, etc., to sew and wash 173 pieces of clothing for the soldiers. After the troops went south, when the news of the victory crossing the river and liberating Nanjing came, everyone was overjoyed. The victory reporting teams of factories and schools in Shijiazhuang spread the news of the victory, which immediately aroused enthusiastic cheers from the masses. More than 200 club members heard the news of the liberation of Nanjing, some ran upstairs and climbed to the windows to shout to the masses. When the news spread to theaters and cinemas, the audience cheered throughout the venue for a long time. Railway workers worked even harder to rush to assemble the Taiyuan locomotive, eager to have it leave the factory immediately. The Shijiazhuang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Shijiazhuang People's Municipal Government and other agencies sent a special telegram to the officers and soldiers of the Yangtze River People's Liberation Army, congratulating them on the victory of the liberation of Nanjing.
