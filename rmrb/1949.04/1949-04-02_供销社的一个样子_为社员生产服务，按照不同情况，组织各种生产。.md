　　A Glimpse of a Supply and Marketing Cooperative:
    Serving the Production Needs of Members, Organizing Various Production Activities According to Different Circumstances.
    [News from Jizhong] The Yimin Cooperative of Dalucun, Fifth District, Ningjin County, truly serves its members. The masses are enthusiastically buying shares, gradually expanding its business. It is currently purchasing tree saplings and peanut and cotton seeds. This village cooperative was established with the help and leadership of the county promotion agency and the village branch. From the time it was established in early December of last year, the business policy was clearly defined as serving the production and life of the members; the nature of the cooperative is supply and marketing. At that time, Zhao Siqi, the branch secretary, and village cadres and party members Chu Fushun and You Xiaoliu, mobilized party members and the masses to buy shares, saying: Buying cotton collectively will definitely be cheaper. Thus, households whose home production was weaving enthusiastically bought shares, totaling two hundred households, raising 600,000 yuan (冀鈔, Jichaopaper currency). At the shareholders' meeting, Zhao Siqi and two others were elected as manager and accountant. It was stipulated that business hours would be after breakfast every day. All three are village cadres, and they take turns working when the village is busy. Except for travel expenses for purchasing goods far away, all work is voluntary. Shares are generally four thousand yuan (per household), but there are also two thousand and one thousand shares. After starting business, it was close to the old lunar year, and only 96 jin of cotton wadding was purchased. The market price was 7,300 yuan per jin, but members bought it for 6,300 yuan. Members hand over the cloth they weave to the cooperative to be transferred to the county promotion agency, and then receive wadding. At the end of the lunar year, the accounts were settled to ensure capital and, in real terms, they earned five jin of cotton. In terms of money, they earned even more. The members said, "We are not doing it for dividends, but for the convenience of production." Cao Shengtin and twelve others also requested to buy shares. At the end of the old year, when the cooperative reported to its members, it reiterated: Shares can be bought and withdrawn at will, and a members' meeting is held every half month. Everyone proposes what goods are needed, and the cooperative buys them. The cooperative is for the convenience of members' production. Since its establishment, the cooperative in Dalucun has supported the weaving production of more than 200 member households. Women such as Duan Xiaoshun and Guo Xiucai bought wadding from the cooperative, wove it into cloth, and then gave it to the cooperative to resell to the promotion agency. They felt that production was very convenient and solved the living expenses for last winter. After the major production plan for this spring was laid out, the cooperative studied that women's weaving will be appropriately reduced in the future, and more people will participate in agricultural production. It is preparing to call on the masses to buy a large number of shares to expand business. It has already gone to Shulu to buy peanut seeds, to Zhaoxian to buy cotton seeds, bought tree saplings from the first district of this county, and sent people to buy hoe blades and other agricultural tools.

　　供销社的一个样子
    为社员生产服务，按照不同情况，组织各种生产。
    【冀中讯】宁晋五区大陆村益民合作社，真正作到为社员服务，群众纷纷入股，逐渐扩大营业，现正购买树秧和花生棉花种籽。该村合作社是由县推进社和村支部帮助、领导成立起来的。从去年十二月初成立时，营业方针就明确确定为社员生产和生活服务；合作社的性质是供销。当时，支部书记赵四起和村干部党员褚福顺、尤小六等三人，动员党员群众入股说：伙买棉花准贱。这样以纺织为家庭生产的户，遂纷纷入股，共二百户，集股金六十万元（冀钞，下同）。在股东大会上选出了赵四起等三人为经理、会计，规定每天早饭后营业，三人都是村干部，村里忙了轮流办公。除了往远处办货用盘费以外，平时全是义务。股金一般都是四千（按户说）元，也有二千、一千的。开始营业后已离旧历年近了，只买了九十六斤花穰子，市价每斤七千三百元，社员买按六千三，社员织出布来就交到社里转县推进社，再领穰子，到旧历年底结帐保本折实还赚了五斤花，按钱说赚得就多了。社员们说：“咱不为的分红，是为了便利生产。”曹生亭等十二人也要求入了股。旧年底合作社向社员报帐时，重新说明：随便入股和撤股，半月开一次社员大会，由大家提议需要什么货，就办什么货，合作社就是为了社员生产便利。大陆村自成立起这个合作社后，扶助着二百多户社员纺织生产，妇女段小顺、郭秀彩等都是从社里买了穰子织成布又给了社里转卖到推进社，她们感到生产上很方便，并解决了去冬的生活用费。今春大生产计划布置下来后，社里研究今后妇女纺织会适当减少，参加农业生产的多了，准备号召群众大量入股，以扩大营业。现已去束鹿买花生种，到赵县买棉花种，从本县一区买了树秧并派人去买锄板等农具。
