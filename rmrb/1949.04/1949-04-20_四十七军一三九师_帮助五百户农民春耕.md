　　The 139th Division of the 47th Army
  　Helps 500 Farm Households with Spring Plowing
　　[This Newspaper Reports] The 139th Division of the 47th Army is actively helping the people with spring plowing. In five days from the 21st to the 25th of last month, they helped the villagers transport 219 cartloads of manure, harrowed 730 mu of land, transported 143 cartloads of earth, carried 768 loads of manure, and did many other odd jobs such as hauling bricks, planting vegetables, and plowing land. A total of 518 households were helped, including eight middle-peasant households, and the rest were families of revolutionary martyrs, military personnel, and poor peasants. Because of their hard work, Zhang Jun, a feeder from the headquarters of the 416th Regiment, Liu Yongji from the 1st Battalion, and soldiers Liu Yongxiang and Wang Enlin from the 3rd Company, were all commended and each received a merit (three merits equal one minor achievement).
　　(Political Department of the 139th Division, Civil Affairs Section)
　　[This Newspaper Reports] A certain unit of our army stationed in Haizhou mobilized all officers and soldiers to suspend training exercises for one day to help local farmers with spring plowing. Each unit vied to do the work. Section Chief Liao of the 1st Section of the Division personally took the lead in carrying manure, spreading manure, and pulling plows, without rest for the whole day. Squad Leader Sun Yonggui of the communication unit carried manure for the villagers despite being ill. Everyone did their work meticulously, such as breaking up the soil clods with harrows after planting wheat. Even the grass roots on the edge of the fields were pulled out. While working, the comrades enthusiastically asked, "Is this how it should be done?" completely following the instructions of the masses. During the work, the villagers automatically brought water to the fields. When the villagers' water had not yet arrived, the cooks had already brought boiled water. Some villagers offered cigarettes and food, but they were politely declined by the soldiers.

　　四十七军一三九师
  　帮助五百户农民春耕
    【本报讯】四十七军一三九师积极助民春耕。于上月二十一至二十五五天内，帮老乡送粪二百一十九车，耙地七百三十亩，拉土一百四十三车，挑粪七百六十八担，及其他拉砖、种菜、翻地等许多零活。受到帮助的群众共五百一十八家，其中有八户是中农，其余是烈、军属和贫苦农民。由于干活努力，四一六团团部饲养员张俊，一营部刘永吉，三连战士刘永祥、王恩林等七人都受到表扬，并各记一个优点的功（三优点为一小功）。
    （一三九师政治部民运科）
    【本报讯】我军某部海州部，顷发动全师官兵，停操课一天，帮助驻地农民春耕。各部都是争先恐后地抢着干，师部一科廖科长亲自带头挑粪、撒粪、拉犁，整整一天没休息。摇机班长孙永贵带着病给老乡挑粪。大家做的活都很细致，如种上麦子后，土块均用耙子打碎。甚至连地边上的草根也都拔去了。同志们一边干活，一边热心的问：“这样干行不行？”完全听从群众指挥。在干活中间，老乡们自动地往地里送水，当老乡的水还没送到地时，炊事员早把开水送到了，有的老乡送烟送饭，但都被战士们婉言谢绝了。
