Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 16th: The China Liberated Areas Youth Federation and the All-China Students Federation issued a joint notice on the 15th regarding the commemoration of the 30th anniversary of the "May Fourth" Movement. The full text is as follows:

This year's "May Fourth" Youth Day coincides with the Chinese New Democratic Revolution, which began with the "May Fourth" Movement, about to achieve victory on a nationwide scale, and Beiping, the birthplace of the "May Fourth" Movement, has been liberated. The First National Youth Congress, a symbol of the great unity of democratic youth across China, will be held in Beiping this "May Fourth." This year's commemoration of the 30th anniversary of the "May Fourth" Movement is of particularly great significance to the youth of the whole country. Therefore, the China Liberated Areas Youth Federation and the All-China Students Federation have decided to expand the commemoration of the "May Fourth" Movement.

To commemorate the "May Fourth" Movement, we should call on the youth of the whole country to study and publicize the history of the Chinese New Democratic Revolution since the "May Fourth" Movement, and to study and publicize Chairman Mao's works such as "On New Democracy." We must recognize the truth that Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought are bound to achieve victory in China, from the beginning of the New Democratic Revolution to the present day, when it is about to achieve victory nationwide.

To commemorate the "May Fourth" Movement, we should call on the youth of the liberated areas to actively engage in production, establish a new attitude towards labor, and strengthen the study of various cultural and scientific knowledge. We should call on the students in the liberated areas to study hard, establish the viewpoint of serving the working people, and participate in appropriate social activities outside of class.

To commemorate the "May Fourth" Movement, we should call on the youth of the whole country to support and participate in the People's Liberation War and the struggle of the people in the Kuomintang-controlled areas against the US-Chiang regime, in order to accelerate the victory of the New Democratic Revolution throughout the country. We should call on the broad masses of youth to stand with the people of the whole country, oppose the international aggression camp headed by US imperialism plotting and preparing to launch a new war, support the peace and democracy camp headed by the Soviet Union, and strengthen the ties between the democratic youth movements of various Eastern countries.

The Liberated Areas Youth Federation and the All-China Students Federation have jointly decided on the following commemorative methods:

(1) In accordance with the above-mentioned contents, adopt various different methods according to the different conditions of each place. Such as holding commemorative meetings, symposiums, lectures, exhibitions, as well as organizing production and study competitions, electing labor heroes and model youth, and publishing special issues and wall newspapers, commemorative essays, etc. When circumstances permit, other commemorative activities may also be held, such as sports meets, bonfire parties, cultural and entertainment evenings, and various sports and recreational activities.

(2) In the middle of commemorating "May Fourth", attention should be paid to establishing and improving democratic youth organizations. In places where student unions and student federations have not yet been established, student unions and student federations should be established through the commemoration of "May Fourth" if possible.

We hope that all youth organizations across the country will adopt our suggestions. The various levels of organizations affiliated with the Liberated Areas Youth Federation and the All-China Students Federation are instructed to implement this, and to report to us on the work plan, the process of implementation, and the work summary.

　　中国解放区青年联合会中华全国学生联合会发出通知
    扩大纪念“五四”卅周年
  　号召青年加紧学习生产支援前线
    【新华社北平十六日电】中国解放区青年联合会、中华全国学生联合会十五日发出关于纪念“五四”三十周年的联合通知。全文如下：
    今年的“五四”青年节，正值从“五四”开始的中国新民主主义革命即将在全国范围内取得胜利，“五四”的发源地北平已获解放。作为全中国民主青年大团结的标志的全国青年第一次代表大会，即将于今年“五四”在北平召开。今年纪念“五四”三十周年，对于全国青年具有特别重大的意义。因此，中国解放区青年联合会与中华全国学生联合会决定扩大举行“五四”纪念。
    纪念“五四”，应当号召全国青年学习与宣传“五四”以来中国新民主主义革命的历史，学习与宣传毛主席新民主主义论等著作。要从新民主主义革命开始直至今天即将在全国取得胜利的历史过程中，认识到马列主义、毛泽东思想必然在中国取得胜利的真理。
    纪念“五四”，应当号召解放区青年积极生产，树立新的劳动态度，加强学习各种文化科学知识。应当号召解放区的学生努力学习，树立为劳动人民服务的观点，并在课外参与适当的社会活动。
    纪念“五四”，应当号召全国青年支援与参加人民解放战争以及在国民党统治区人民反对美蒋的斗争，以加速新民主主义革命在全国的胜利。应当号召广大青年与全国人民在一起，反对以美帝为首的阴谋准备与发动新战争的国际侵略阵营，拥护以苏联为首的和平民主阵营，加强东方各国民主青年运动的联系。
    解放区青联与全国学联特共同决定纪念办法如下：
    （一）按照以上各项内容，依各地条件的不同，采取各种不同的方式。如召开纪念大会、座谈会、讲演会、展览会，以及组织生产与学习竞赛，选举劳动英雄模范青年，及出版特刊壁报，纪念征文等。在情况许可时，并可举办其他纪念活动，如运动会、营火会、文化娱乐晚会及各种体育娱乐活动等。
    （二）要在纪念“五四”的中间，注意建立与健全民主青年组织。尚未成立学生会与学联的地方，如有可能，应通过纪念“五四”成立学生会及学联。
    希望全国各青年团体采纳我们的建议。责成解放区青联与全国学联所属的各级组织予以执行，并将工作计划、执行经过及工作总结报告我们。
　　　一九四九年四月十五日
