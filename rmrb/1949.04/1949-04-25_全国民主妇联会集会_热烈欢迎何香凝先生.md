　　National Democratic Women's Federation Meeting
　　Warmly Welcomes Mr. He Xiangning

　　[Our newspaper reported] The National Democratic Women's Federation warmly welcomed Mr. He Xiangning, honorary chairman of the federation, in Beiping yesterday (24th). More than 300 women representatives from all walks of life attended. After the good news of the liberation of Nanjing was received during the meeting, the welcoming meeting and the celebration meeting immediately merged. Comrade Deng Yingchao, vice chairman of the federation, first delivered a welcoming speech, saying: "Mr. He Xiangning and Ms. Soong Ching Ling are the most faithful followers of Mr. Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People and are good friends of the Chinese people and the Chinese Communist Party." Comrade Deng Yingchao, on behalf of women across the country, warned the Kuomintang reactionaries in Shanghai: "If the Kuomintang secret agents in Shanghai inflict any harm on Madam Sun on the eve of Shanghai's liberation, the women of the whole country will absolutely not forgive them." Subsequently, democratic figures from the women's community, such as Ms. Lei Jieqiong, Shi Xiuying, a representative of female workers in Beiping, and Li Xiuxian, a representative of female students, delivered speeches of welcome. In his reply, Mr. He Xiangning particularly emphasized calling on women across the country to participate in labor production.
