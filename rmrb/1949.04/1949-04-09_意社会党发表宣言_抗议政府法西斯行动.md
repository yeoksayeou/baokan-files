TASS, Rome, 6th: The Executive Committee of the Italian Socialist Party issued a declaration stating that Minister of Interior Scelba's speech in Siena was a violent and open threat to the freedom of the opposition. The declaration pointed out that the government's attempt to classify the actions of those who oppose its foreign policy as illegal is the most serious sign of entering into open fascist methods. The Executive Committee of the Socialist Party called on all free citizens, regardless of their political beliefs, to recognize the extreme seriousness of the threats posed by Scelba to various political parties, trade union organizations, etc., and to do their best to reject the government's attempt to restore past reactionary measures.

　　意社会党发表宣言
  　抗议政府法西斯行动
    【新华社北平七日电】塔斯社罗马六日讯：意大利社会党执行委员会发表宣言称，内政部长谢尔巴在西纳的演说，是对反对派之自由的强暴而公开的威胁。宣言指出，政府企图把反对其外交政策者的行动列为非法行动，这是进入公开法西斯手段的最严重的信号。社会党执行委员会号召一切自由公民，不论其政治信仰如何，都要认识谢尔巴所提出的对各政党，各工会团体等威胁的极端严重性，并尽力拒绝政府恢复过去的反动措施的企图。
