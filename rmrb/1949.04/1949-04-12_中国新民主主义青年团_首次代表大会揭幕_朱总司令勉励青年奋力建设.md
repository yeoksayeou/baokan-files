    First National Congress Opens
  　Commander-in-Chief Zhu Encourages Youth to Strive for Construction
    [Our Newspaper's Dispatch] The first National Congress of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League solemnly opened in Peiping yesterday (the 11th). Three hundred and forty delegates (including seventeen alternate delegates) came from the Northeast, Northwest, North China, East China, Central Plains liberated areas, and the Kuomintang-controlled areas, including overseas Taiwan. They are labor heroes from factories, production models from rural areas, learning models from schools, combat heroes from the military, and representatives of youth work from various periods of the Chinese youth movement, marking an unprecedentedly victorious gathering in the history of the national youth movement. Representatives from the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the headquarters of the People's Liberation Army, Zhu De, the Korean Youth Delegation, comrades-in-arms from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, Li Lisan, representative of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, Deng Yingchao, representative of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, Xie Bangding, representative of the All-China Students' Federation, and democratic figures such as Shen Junru, Tan Pingshan, Ma Xulun, Mao Dun, Zhang Naiqi, and Wu Han were present. The venue was filled with red flags, and portraits of the great teachers of world and Chinese youth, Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin, Mao Zedong, and Zhu De, affectionately looked down upon the representatives of these advanced youths in the congress. More than seventy brocade banners sent by various sectors of the Party, government, and military expressed their love and expectations for the Youth League.
    After Comrade Feng Wenbin, Chairman of the Congress, delivered the opening speech (see separate article), Commander-in-Chief Zhu, on behalf of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the headquarters of the People's Liberation Army, delivered a congratulatory message to the congress, encouraging the young generation of China to strive for construction (see separate article). Zhang Ruizhen, Vice-Chairman of the Central Committee of the North Korean Democratic Youth League of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, reported to the congress on behalf of the 5.3 million Korean youths, pointing out that the youths of China and Korea have fought together in the past and present to overthrow the common enemies of Japanese imperialism and American imperialism, and hoped that they could unite more closely and advance side by side in the future. In his speech, Comrade Li Lisan said that the Chinese youth movement has always been under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, working closely with the working class and fighting together, thus achieving brilliant accomplishments, and believed that it would definitely make greater contributions in future construction. Comrade Deng Yingchao said: The youth movement and the women's movement are closely related. She earnestly hoped that the Youth League members could widely unite young women from all walks of life and lead the vast number of children. Subsequently, Mr. Shen Junru, Tan Pingshan, Ma Xulun, Mao Dun, Zhang Naiqi, Wu Han, and others delivered speeches. Mr. Shen, Tan and others especially mentioned that the achievements of the youth movement are inseparable from the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. Although they are old, they are willing to be with young friends and jointly study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. Mr. Ma Xulun said that the difference between the New Democratic Youth League and the Three People's Principles Youth League is the difference between revolution and counter-revolution. Mr. Mao Dun compared the youth movement during the "May Fourth" period with today's youth movement, explaining that the youth movement has made leapfrog progress. At the end of the congress, a resolution was passed to support the Nanjing "April 1st" massacre, express condolences to the students who suffered, and decided to have a vegetarian diet for one day today to show mourning and remembrance.
