    Regulations of the North China People's Government
    Will be Compiled and Published
    To the Editor:
    I often see in your newspaper's "Questions and Answers" column, matters handled according to Article ×, Section ×× of the regulations of the North China People's Government. Apart from the announcement of the agricultural tax, other regulations have not been published. For example, the interim standards for public expense treatment for middle school and normal school students and the treatment of their faculty were only published after someone inquired. Also, it was previously announced that tax collection work would be carried out according to new regulations starting from January 1st, but what are the new regulations? It is hoped that the government will publish various regulations immediately.
    Wang Zizhong, Pindong County
    Comrade Zizhong:
    Regarding the question about laws and decrees, the answer is as follows: Various regulations and ordinances promulgated by the North China People's Government have been published successively in the PingShan People's Daily in the past, but because the people in the newly liberated cities have not seen this newspaper before, they mostly do not know about them. In order to enable the people in the newly liberated cities to understand the various regulations and ordinances promulgated by the North China People's Government, we have suggested that the North China People's Government compile the important laws and decrees promulgated in the past into a book for sale as soon as possible, so that everyone can know about them.

    华北人民政府法规
    将汇编发行
    编辑同志：
    常见贵报“询问与答复”栏内，依照华北人民政府规定的×条例第×条××执行云。除农业税公布外，其他条例未见公布，例如：中学及师范学生公费待遇及其教职员待遇暂行标准，直到有人询问才公布。又如前公布：一月一日起税收工作要按新条例执行，但未见新条例是什么？希政府将各种条例即日公布是要。
    平定县王子中
    子中同志：
    询问法令问题，答复如下：华北人民政府所公布的各种法规，条例，过去均已在平山人民日报上陆续登载过，但因新解放的城市人民过去没有看到该报，故多不知道。为使新解放的城市人民对华北人民政府所颁布的各种法规条例有所了解，我们已建议华北人民政府把过去所颁布的重要法令尽速汇编成册出售，俾众周知。
