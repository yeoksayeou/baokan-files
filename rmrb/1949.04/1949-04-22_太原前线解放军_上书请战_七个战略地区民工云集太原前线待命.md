[Telegram from the Taiyuan Front] (Delayed) The People's Liberation Army, which is besieging Taiyuan, has been improving its tactics through training, and troops are writing letters requesting battle, eager to make contributions in the Taiyuan campaign. During the siege of Taiyuan, this unit widely launched a training movement on the position, truly achieving a unity of combat and teaching, learning and application. In the offensive practice of the third company of a certain regiment, they first familiarized themselves with the enemy's position and then selected a similar terrain, setting up many fake substitutes for research. A certain division also established an inspection team, led by the division leaders themselves, to conduct specific inspections in various units. In order to improve the military level of cadres, a certain unit held a tactical test. Chen Qingsheng, a machine gunner of a certain unit, hit 29 rings with three bullets after hard training. Many combat units have recently written letters requesting battle. A certain company wrote in its letter of request: In terms of technology, 80% of the company can use explosives and bayonets, and the average grenade throwing distance is 31 meters. In terms of tactics, the coordination and actions of squads, platoons, companies, and battalions in command and combat are relatively skilled. In terms of politics, class consciousness has increased, and they are generally requesting battle, formulating "Compliance with Government Covenants" and helping new comrades. The company's combat plan: resolutely seize a position in the Taiyuan campaign, guarantee that each person captures a prisoner, overcome difficulties, and abide by the company's "Policy Covenants" when entering Taiyuan City, ensuring good unity with fraternal units. They are challenging each other. Yang Liuer, the hero of explosions, was selected as a special-class hero at the brigade's commendation meeting and was promoted to squad leader. This time he said: "During the general offensive on Taiyuan, I will make more contributions and turn my entire squad into a hero squad!"

[Telegram from Jinzhong, April 21] (Delayed) Marching thousands of miles to support the liberation of Taiyuan, laborers from Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia, Jin Sui, Ji'nan, Ji'zhong, Taihang, Beiyue, Jinzhong and other places have gathered at the Taiyuan front. Labor corps from thirteen counties, including Wucheng, Qinghe, Gucheng, and Ji counties in Ji'nan, arrived at the Taiyuan front one after another at the end of last month after a long journey. In the 1,800-person contingent from Wucheng County, only nine people fell behind during the thousand-mile journey, but they also rushed to the front one after another when the main force arrived. Sun Shengtang, a laborer from Zhangzhuang Village in the county, suddenly suffered an acute illness during the march. The county and district cadres wrote him a letter of introduction, hired a car, and sent him home for treatment, but he insisted on being treated locally. After his illness was slightly relieved, he traveled two days' worth of journey in one day to catch up with the team. The stretcher teams from ten counties in Taihang, including Lincheng, Zanhuang, Pingshun, and Changzhi, arrived at the Taiyuan front on April 19. They accepted the experience of the laborers who participated in the Taiyuan peripheral campaign for the first time, and fully prepared various transportation equipment suitable for mountain operations and a full set of battlefield living equipment before the expedition. Each squad carried specially made light hoes and shovels for digging fortifications, and they are currently undergoing battlefield practice with the direct help of the People's Liberation Army, with extremely high enthusiasm for participating in the war. The Taihang Huguan stretcher team achieved the best results in battlefield exercises, and the entire county's stretcher teams could be assembled in less than five minutes. Laborers from several counties in Ji'zhong, including Ningjin, Luancheng, Gaocheng, and Jinxian, have also taken the opportunity to set off a wave of martial arts training. The Ningjin labor corps and troops practiced martial arts and climbed mountains together every day before dawn, and learned basic military knowledge about air defense, bulletproofing, poison gas prevention, and first aid on the battlefield. All the stretcher team members of the third company in the county have gained increased confidence after practicing martial arts, and specially requested to undertake first-line rescue tasks from the superiors; and proposed a competition to all the laborers participating in the Taiyuan campaign, resolutely following the army to make contributions on the front line. The ten labor corps of the Ninth Military Subdistrict of Ji'zhong, which arrived at the front line on April 15, have joined the Taihang laborers and are carrying out battlefield road repairs with the cooperation and guidance of the PLA engineers. The Jinzhong nineteen county labor stretcher teams and horse-drawn transport teams have been assigned tasks in batches. Zhao Baoquan, a laborer from Xiangyuan Village, Pingyao Third District, quickly completed the spring plowing after the land reform and prepared a set of necessary supplies to support the front—a tea mug, a carrying pole, etc. His wife also specially prepared red dates and dry food for Lao Zhao. A huge cart transport team composed of Beiyue and other regions is also fully loaded with grain and grass, continuously supplying the front line. In addition, labor corps from the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region and Jinsui's Jingle, Guoxian, Ningwu and other places have also recently rushed to the Taiyuan front from afar and have joined forces with fraternal laborers from all over North China. Currently, laborers on all fronts are actively repairing various tools, shoes and socks, and preparing to welcome the battle.
