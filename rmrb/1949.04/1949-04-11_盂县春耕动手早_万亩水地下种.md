[Jinzhong Telegram] In Yu County, the masses' enthusiasm for spring plowing is high and they have started early after the land reform. The barley and summer yams on 10,800 mu of irrigated land in the fourth and fifth districts were all sown by the end of last month. In Changchi River, Ninth District, due to the cold climate, the land cannot be plowed in the morning. The whole village organized 100 head of livestock to deliver manure in the morning and plow the land in the afternoon. In addition, manpower was organized to dig and break up soil clumps. Now, one-third of the village's 17,000 mu of land has been plowed. Guo Village, Second District, has good organization and leadership, ensuring that both production and support for the front lines are not delayed: the village chief leads production, and the deputy village chief leads support for the front lines. According to statistics on March 17, the whole village had plowed 216 mu of land, cleared 934 mu of stubble land, and delivered more than 80,000 loads of manure. Women put forward the slogan "This year, we will be the main force on the production front." Women's organizations alone cleared 943 mu of stubble land. The turned-over peasant Rong Wanli fertilized with green manure and bought sheep manure last autumn, and got up early and went to bed late this spring to accumulate manure, applying an average of 100 loads of manure per mu of land.

　　盂县春耕动手早
  　万亩水地下种
    【晋中电】盂县土改后群众春耕情绪高，动手早，四、五区的一万零八百亩水地的大麦与夏山药蛋，已于上月底全部下种。九区苌池川，因气候寒冷，早上不能耕地，全村组织起一百犋牲口，上午送粪，下午耕地，再加组织人力刨、打土块，现全村一万七千亩土地，已耕过三分之一。二区郭村组织领导好，使生产、支援前线两不误：村长领导生产，副村长领导支援前线。据三月十七日统计：全村已耕地二百一十六亩，刨楂地九百三十四亩；送粪八万余担。妇女提出了“今年要作生产战线上的主力军”的口号。仅妇女组织刨楂地即九百四十三亩。翻身农民荣万里，去年秋季即压绿肥、买羊粪，今年春季又早起晚睡的积肥，每亩地平均上一百担粪。
