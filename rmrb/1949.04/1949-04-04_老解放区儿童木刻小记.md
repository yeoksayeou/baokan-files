　　A Short Note on Children's Woodcuts in the Old Liberated Areas
    Zou Ya
    These children's woodcuts are free creations of children in the Taihang anti-Japanese base area during the War of Resistance Against Japan. In the past, there was no opportunity to publish them, and some were lost. Now, a few have been found again from books. Unfortunately, the names of the authors are no longer remembered.

    During the War of Resistance Against Japan, we lived in the countryside and often went to the market to practice sketching. This attracted many children from the village to watch and ask us art workers for paintings. After school every day, they would come to our house to watch us make woodcuts. They would also draw and bring their work to us for comments, asking us to teach them, asking us for pear wood boards, and borrowing knives to carve themselves. We gave them some paper and wooden boards and let them draw and carve freely. They carved on benches, sweating profusely and full of enthusiasm. Even if they broke their little hands, they wouldn't cry. They would wrap them with a piece of cloth and continue carving until they finished a piece. However, because there were too few tools and they couldn't be bought, it was impossible to promote it universally. But later, mud carving was developed in elementary schools throughout the Taihang area. The knives for mud carving were relatively simple, and several pieces of tinplate could be used to make carving knives. Then, mud was used to make clay figures, which replaced pear wood boards. This was similar to woodcuts in different ways, and many works were published in children's publications in Taihang. Unfortunately, I can't find a single piece now.

    From these children's woodcuts, we can see the new thinking of children in the old liberated areas. Each one reflects the real struggle of life, depicting their understanding of politics, their observation of reality, and reflecting their own lives. At the same time, in terms of formal expression, they are also brand new and diverse, without any restraint, very childish and natural, concise and lively. For example, the picture of the Japanese devils leading the traitors and bandits was created by a fourteen-year-old young soldier (i.e., a young orderly). After listening to the instructor's speech, he expressed his political understanding in the form of a cartoon. Pictures such as "Soldiers Transporting" and "Delivering Public Grain" reflect the wartime life behind enemy lines. "July 7th" Conference, was carved by an elementary school student the day after he participated in this memorial meeting, depicting a large meeting scene in a small woodcut. Pictures such as "Picking Up Manure" and "Carrying Loads and Driving Donkeys" reflect the daily life of farmers. There are also paintings of their own happy school life, such as "Racing," which expresses the feeling of movement quite fully and powerfully.

    In short, they are all free thought and free creation, unlike the past when children's art education simply asked children to imitate and copy, and to draw subjects that were divorced from the struggle of life, which restricted their intellectual development.

    Many comrades who have seen these woodcuts believe that they are a new approach worth promoting in children's art education. They are now specially introduced for reference and research by children's art education workers.

　　老解放区儿童木刻小记
    邹雅
    这几幅儿童木刻，是在抗日战争时期，太行敌后根据地的儿童的自由创作。过去没有发表的机会，有的失散了，现在偶然又从书里找出几幅来，可惜作者的名字都不记得了。
    在抗日战争时期，我们住在农村里，常到场上去练习速写，引起村里许多儿童围着来看，向我们美术工作者要画。每天放了学，就到我们家里去看我们刻木刻，他们也画了拿来交给我们提意见，要求我们教他们，向我们要梨木板，要借刀子给他们也去刻。我们就送他们一点纸和木板，让他们自由去画，自由去刻，在板凳上，刻得满头大汗，兴致勃勃，刻破了小手，也不哭，用布片包一包，仍旧继续的刻，非把一幅刻成是不停止的。但是因为工具太少，又买不到，也就无法普遍提倡。但后来在太行区各地小学校里发展起泥刻来，泥刻的刀子比较简单，用几块洋铁片，自己就能做成刻刀，再用泥做成泥人，便代替梨木板。这与木刻是异曲同工的东西，曾在太行出版的儿童刊物上发表过不少作品，可惜手头已找不到一幅了。
    我们从这几幅儿童木刻里，可以看出老解放区儿童的新的思想，每一幅都是反映着现实的斗争生活，描绘出他们对政治的认识，对现实的观察，以及反映他们自己的生活等。同时在形式的表现上，也是崭新而多样的，毫不受拘束，都很稚气而自然，简洁而生动。例如那幅日本鬼子牵着汉奸和托匪一图，这是我们一个十四岁的路军小鬼（即小勤务员）的作品，他听了指导员的讲话后，把他这一政治认识，用漫画的形式表现出来；如战士运输和送公粮两图，反映着敌后的战时生活，象“七七”大会，是一个小学生参加了这一纪念会后第二天刻的，把一个开会的大场面在一幅小木刻里描写出来了，如拾粪和挑担赶毛驴两图，把日常见到的农民的生活反映出来；还有画他们自己的愉快的学校生活，赛跑一幅，动的感觉表现得相当充分而有力。
    总之，他们都是自由的思想，自由的创作，不象过去对儿童美术教育那样，叫儿童们单纯地依样临摹，并且画着脱离生活斗争的题材，束缚了他们的思想发展。
    很多同志见了这几幅木刻，都认为对儿童美术教育上是值得提倡的一条新路子，现特介绍出来，供儿童美术教育工作者参考和研究。
