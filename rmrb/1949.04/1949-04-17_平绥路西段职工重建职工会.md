Xinhua News Agency, Xing County, 15th: The employees of the western section of the Ping-Sui Railway officially re-established their trade union at a representative meeting held last month. This trade union was founded during the liberation period in 1946 but was forced to cease operations when the Kuomintang bandit troops occupied the section. After the section was re-liberated last November and December, the employees actively worked on resuming work and completed the preparations for restoring the trade union. Currently, employees at each station have begun to establish amateur clubs, and the employees at Jining Station have pooled their resources to establish a consumer cooperative. The employees of this section made great efforts in resuming work and supporting the War of Liberation. When eastern Suiyuan was first liberated last winter, the employees proposed the slogan "Wherever the People's Liberation Army goes, we will repair the railway there," and rushed to repair the railway. Drivers braved enemy aircraft strafing and drove back and forth twenty times between Fengzhen and Shiba Tai, a distance of one hundred kilometers, in one day and night, completing the task of supporting the front lines. On one occasion, two locomotives derailed. At that time, there were no machines to lift the cars, so the employees laid stones and iron plates in the freezing weather for two consecutive days and nights, finally pulling the locomotives back onto the tracks. When the Kuomintang bandit troops invaded the section along the line in September 1946, the employees not only worked hard to maintain transportation but also helped the People's Liberation Army fight. When the People's Liberation Army withdrew from the line, hundreds of employees voluntarily followed the army to the liberated areas to study and have now become strong revolutionary work cadres. The employees of this section had carried out various heroic struggles during the Kuomintang occupation and the Japanese occupation and suffered all kinds of persecution. During the Kuomintang rule, the railway bureau established a puppet trade union and a "Communist Purge Committee" to exploit and persecute employees. Many employees were brutally killed under the charge of "collaborating with the bandits." According to preliminary statistics, more than seventy employees of this section died under the guns and knives of the Japanese invaders and the Kuomintang. In 1945, eleven workers, including Song Youshan, were tied to trees by the Japanese invaders and bitten to death by military dogs.

　　平绥路西段职工重建职工会
    【新华社兴县十五日电】平绥铁路西段职工在上月召开的代表大会上正式恢复了自己的职工会。该职工会成立于一九四六年解放时期，在国民党匪军侵据该段期间被迫停止活动；去年十一、十二月间，该段重获解放以后，职工们在积极复工中完成了恢复工会的准备工作。现各站职工已开始成立业余俱乐部，集宁站职工并集资成立了消费合作社。该段职工曾在复工中和支援解放战争中作了很大的努力。当去冬绥远东部刚获解放时，职工们就提出“解放军到那里，我们修到那里”的口号，抢修铁路。司机人员曾冒敌机扫射，在一昼夜间，从丰镇到十八台的一百公里之间，往返开车二十趟，完成了支援前线的任务。一次有两部机车出轨，当时没有起车的机器，职工们在冰天雪地中，一连两昼夜，铺石子，垫铁板，终于把机车拉上轨道。当一九四六年九月国民党匪军侵犯该段沿线时，职工们不仅努力保持运输，而且帮助解放军作战。当解放军从沿线撤退时，成百职工自动随军撤退，到解放区学习，现已成为坚强的革命工作干部。该段职工曾在国民党侵占期间和日寇统治期间，曾进行各种英勇斗争，并受尽各种迫害。国民党统治期间，铁路局成立了伪工会和“清共委员会”压榨残害职工。不少职工，因“通匪”罪名被惨杀。据初步统计，该段职工，前后死于日寇和国民党枪刀之下者达七十余人。一九四五年，工人宋有山等十一人，被日寇捆在树上用军狗咬死。
