　　Tower Hill Hero Regiment Vows to March South
  　Shen Junru and Other Democratic Parties Present Flags to Pay Respects
    [This Newspaper] The famous "Tower Hill Hero Regiment" attached to the Fourth Field Army held a rally yesterday (the 15th) to vow to march south. Responding to the superior's call to "advance into the south of the Yangtze River and liberate the whole country," all the officers and soldiers of the regiment have made full preparations ideologically and materially in recent days. Everyone at the meeting unanimously stated: We will resolutely carry forward the glorious tradition of winning every battle and taking every position, quickly strike into the south of the Yangtze River, and capture the war criminal Chiang Kai-shek alive. Comrade Guo Geling, the political commissar of the regiment, said at the meeting: The war criminal Chiang Kai-shek is still gathering remnants and defeated soldiers, attempting a final struggle and resisting stubbornly. We will definitely fight to the south of the Yangtze River, capture Chiang Kai-shek alive, and liberate the 200 million oppressed people in the south of the Yangtze River. All the officers and soldiers of the regiment responded in unison, and the shouts shook the sky. They also wrote letters one after another to express their determination, striving to be heroes in killing the enemy and models of work.
    Note: Last October, when the People's Liberation Army attacked Jinzhou, the bandit Chiang Kai-shek personally commanded eleven regular divisions, scurrying northwest from Jinzhou, attempting to relieve the siege of Jinzhou. A certain unit of the Fourth Field Army was ordered to hold the Tower Hill line. The 34th Regiment of the 12th Division of this unit bore the brunt. After several days and nights of bloody battle, it finally repelled countless joint offensives by the Chiang bandit's naval, land, and air forces, ensuring that our attacking troops could prepare calmly and take Jinzhou in one fell swoop. The regiment was awarded the glorious title of "Tower Hill Hero Regiment."
    [Also News] Before the "Tower Hill Hero Regiment" held a rally to vow to march south, at 10:30 a.m. on the 15th, democratic figures in Ping, including Shen Junru, Peng Zemin, Tan Pingshan, Cai Tingkai, Chen Qiyou, Xia Kangnong, Chen Qiyuan, and Zhou Jianren, representing the China Democratic League, the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, the China National Democratic Construction Association, the China Association for Promoting Democracy, the Three People's Principles Comrades Association of the Chinese Kuomintang, the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, the China National Salvation Association, the Democratic Promotion Association of the Chinese Kuomintang, the China Zhi Gong Party, the Chinese Association of Academic Workers, the Chinese Association of Scientific Workers, and the All-China Federation of Literary Associations, presented flags to the Chinese People's Liberation Army's Fourth Field Army guarding Peiping, to pay respects. Representatives of the "Tower Hill Hero Regiment" accepted the flag on behalf of the unit. Mr. Shen Junru first delivered a congratulatory speech on behalf of the twelve democratic parties and people's organizations, followed by Mr. Cai Tingkai, representing these parties and organizations, presenting a banner with the inscription "Winning Every Battle, Liberating the South of the Yangtze River" to the army. Subsequently, Yang Fengchun, a soldier from the First Company of the Tower Hill Hero Regiment, delivered a reply on behalf of all the soldiers of the regiment. Comrade Yang Fengchun said with confidence: "We have one hundred percent confidence and certainty to completely defeat the Kuomintang reactionaries, march into the south of the Yangtze River, liberate the whole of China, and make contributions to the people in the south of the Yangtze River to respond to the ardent hopes of the people of the whole country and democratic figures."

　　塔山英雄团誓师南征
  　沈钧儒等代表民主党派献旗致敬
    【本报讯】第四野战军所属著名的“塔山英雄团”于昨（十五）日举行南征誓师大会。全团指战员响应上级“进军江南、解放全国”的号召，连日从思想上，物质上作了充分的准备。大家在会上一致表示：坚决发扬过去战必胜攻必克的光荣传统，迅速打到江南去，活捉战犯蒋介石。该团政治委员郭戈令同志在会上说：战犯蒋介石还在收拾残兵败将，企图最后挣扎，负隅顽抗。我们一定打到江南去，活捉蒋介石，解放江南二万万还被压迫的人民。全团指战员一致响应，呼声震天。并纷纷上书表示决心，争做杀敌英雄与工作模范。
    按：去年十月，人民解放军进攻锦州，蒋匪介石亲自指挥十一个正规师，由锦西北窜，图解锦州之围。第四野战军某部奉命坚守塔山一线，该部十二师三十四团首当其冲，经过数昼夜血战，终于打退蒋匪无数次海陆空军联合进攻，保障我攻击部队能从容准备，一举而下锦州。该团遂获得“塔山英雄团”的光荣称号。
    【又讯】“塔山英雄团”举行南征誓师大会之前，十五日上午十时半，在平民主人士沈钧儒、彭泽民、谭平山、蔡廷锴、陈其尤、夏康农、陈其瑗、周建人等，代表中国民主同盟、中国国民党革命委员会、民主建国会、中国民主促进会、中国国民党三民主义同志联合会、中国农工民主党、中国人民救国会、中国国民党民主促进会、中国致公党、中国学术工作者协会、中国科学工作者协会、中华全国文艺协会等十二个民主党派与人民团体，向警卫北平的中国人民解放军第四野战军某部献旗致敬。“塔山英雄团”代表该部受旗。沈钧儒先生首先代表十二个民主党派和人民团体致祝词，继由蔡廷锴先生代表这些党派团体向该军献“旗开得胜，解放江南”的锦旗，随后，塔山英雄团第一连战士杨逢春代表全团战士致答词，杨逢春同志充满信心地说：“我们有百分之百的信心和把握，彻底打垮国民党反动派，进军江南，解放全中国，在江南为人民立功来回答全国人民和民主人士的热望。”
