　　Under the instigation of US Imperialism
  　Syria "Coup"
    [Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, 2nd] Reports from various sources: Syrian Army Chief of Staff, Colonel Sam, launched a coup d'état in the Syrian capital Damascus on the evening of March 29th. Syrian President al-Quwatli and all cabinet members were arrested at the same time. Sam has established himself as the head of state. The coup occurred just as American oil groups were about to sign a pipeline agreement with the Syrian government. The United States had recently expressed dissatisfaction with the Syrian President's failure to implement "essential security measures" to protect the pipeline. Sam's actions are clearly related to the United States supporting the establishment of a military dictatorship in Syria.

　　在美帝策动下
  　叙利亚“政变”
    【新华社北平二日电】各方报道：叙利亚陆军总司令萨姆上校，于三月二十九日晚在叙京大马士革发动政变。叙总统柯特利及所有阁员均于同时被捕。萨姆已自立为元首。政变正发生于美国石油集团即将与叙政府签订油管协定之际。美国最近曾对叙总统未能实行为保护油管所“必不可少的安全措施”表示不满。萨姆的行动，显然与美国支持建立叙利亚的军事独裁有关。
