　　The New Democratic Youth League of Shijiazhuang

　　--One of the Reports from the First Youth Congress of North China

　　Lin Yanying, An Yuanrong

　　The Youth League of Shijiazhuang has been established for nine months now. In the past, due to the long-term reactionary rule and deceptive propaganda of the Japanese invaders and the Kuomintang, the establishment of the New Democratic Youth League in Shijiazhuang encountered many difficulties. However, due to the concrete implementation of the Party and the democratic government's various policies, the rapid development of the revolutionary situation, and our extensive publicity and education, the youth's awareness has been increasing day by day, and the youth's demand to join the League has been growing.

　　I. From the Establishment of the League to the Present

　　Before the establishment of the League, the leading organs of Shijiazhuang took open deliberation, using symposiums, lectures, and various lively and effective methods such as newspapers, wall newspapers, and blackboards to mobilize. In June of last year, the Shijiazhuang Daily published news about the establishment of the League in the Northeast and the joint League establishment in the Border Region. Then, a symposium of 200 young people and activists from all walks of life was held at the Municipal Teachers College. Subsequently, Comrade Feng Wenbin was invited to give a report on "The Chinese Youth Movement and the Youth League," which proved to be very effective. At the same time, various specific activities were organized according to the needs and interests of the youth, such as cultural classes in Da Xing Yarn Factory, technical training classes in the Railway Bureau, and democratic movements and social activities in schools. This not only provided cultural learning but also strengthened political and organizational education and conducted ideological deliberation, laying a preliminary foundation for the establishment of the League. Due to the lack of experience and insufficient cadre strength, we adopted the policy of focusing on trial establishment first and then gradually expanding in the early stages of the League's establishment. We first equipped cadres in Da Xing Yarn Factory, Municipal Teachers College, and the Railway Bureau to start building the League. At the same time, other units continued to promote and deliberate extensively. As the key establishment of the League gained basic experience and the youth's awareness greatly improved, especially after the publication of the Central Committee's resolution on the establishment of the League, the youth demanded to join the League one after another. Therefore, we adopted a more general development, successively establishing League organizations in nine public factories such as the Coking Plant and the Telephone Bureau, four middle schools, and twelve municipal enterprises and organs. We also began to experiment with establishing the League in private factories, shops, streets, and rural areas in the suburbs of the city. The Second District has established League organizations in the cotton weaving industry, and each district also has League branches. As of the beginning of March, the city has twelve directly subordinate general branches of the Municipal League, seventy-eight branches (including districts), one hundred and sixty-four groups, and one thousand two hundred and fifty League members! Among them, workers and staff League members account for 60%, students and teachers account for 36%, and soldiers, citizens, and farmers account for 4%.

　　Our experience in the steps of establishing the League is that we must first start with workers and students, expand to districts, streets, and rural areas, from one point to several points, from part to whole, from public enterprises to private enterprises, from urban to suburban. We believe that this gradual expansion policy is correct.

　　However, in the process of establishing the League, due to the lack of sufficient deliberation in some units, unclear guidelines and routes, the Municipal League's insufficient leadership, and some League establishment cadres being eager to achieve quick results, some deviations such as mass development (e.g., the Coking Plant) and secret establishment of the League (e.g., the Machine Factory) have occurred, as well as some unorganized phenomena. However, after being discovered, they were corrected in time. These deviations have now been basically corrected or are being corrected.

　　Currently, the organization of the Youth League in the city is focusing on consolidating and improving the organization at all levels, establishing and adhering to the meeting and reporting system, improving and enriching the group meetings, conducting planned learning, and enlivening the life of the League.

　　II. The Role of League Members on Various Fronts

　　Under the direct cultivation and education of the League, the general League members in the city actively responded to the various calls of the Party and the democratic government, and played an active and vanguard role in various production, work, and learning, and have become loyal assistants to the Party and the democratic government. During the preparations for war in Shijiazhuang last October, League members actively engaged in the preparations for war. After the preparations for war, the Shijiazhuang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China put forward the call for increasing production to compensate for losses to public enterprises. League members in various factories enthusiastically participated in the production competition, and further established a new labor attitude in the competition movement. League members of Da Xing Yarn Factory put forward the slogan of "Increase production, save raw materials, cherish machines, and help each other," breaking the old idea of "You don't help me, I don't help you." League members Quan Pingjin and Zhang Fengjuan helped others connect after finishing their own work, saying, "You don't help me, I'll help you." In the car division competition, most League members won red flags (award flags). League members Nie Qingzhen and Zhang Fengjuan achieved the highest record in the factory - nine red flags, and League member Zhang Fengyi received nine commendations. Yao Qishun and Bai Lanhua proposed the guarantee conditions of "Let's compete in our group to ensure that we don't run the car, don't casually go to the toilet, don't practice knots, don't be absent from work, go to work early, and don't delay eating" in order to compete for the red flag. This not only won them the red flag but also motivated the old male worker Feng Guangshun to win the red flag as well. The results of the competition evaluation (once every ten days) showed that thirty-three League members won the red flag (the number who didn't win the red flag was extremely small), sixteen League members won the red flag five times or more, and seventeen League members won the red flag less than five times. For example, League members Wu Guirong and Wu Guoshan of the Railway Machine Factory organized mutual aid groups in the production increase campaign, which increased output and completed tasks. For example, League members in the Telephone Bureau and other departments played a considerable role in the competition movement. Many League members were rewarded, ensuring the completion of production tasks, and some even exceeded the tasks.

　　After the preparations for war in October, the secondary schools launched a learning competition. The Municipal Teachers College Youth League proposed that the average score of League members should strive to be above 70 in the annual exam. The No. 2 Middle School Youth League challenged the Youth Leagues of other schools. In the competition learning, they not only improved their own learning but also helped students with poor grades to make up their lessons. Municipal Teachers College League member Kui Zhiren scored zero in mathematics before the competition, but improved to 59 points after the competition. Hao Shenfeng failed algebra before the competition, but improved to 90 points after the competition. League members in each school ensured the completion of the school's education plan. When each school elected learning role models before last year's annual holiday, most of the role models were League members. The six school-wide role models in the Municipal Teachers College were all League members. In addition, they united non-League students to carry out mass propaganda activities outside during the holidays.

　　League members in other organs, banks, municipal enterprises, and security forces also played an active role in various positions, and work efficiency has been improved.

　　These facts all show that the League members in the city have made considerable contributions and played an indispensable role for the cause of the people's revolution and for the construction of the people's Shijiazhuang.

　　III. League Learning and Life

　　The general League members' biggest demand in learning is to learn politics, culture, and technology. In January and February, all League members in the city studied the Central Committee's resolution on the establishment of the League and the League Constitution. In order to launch a learning movement, the Municipal League Preparatory Committee held dozens of reports on the above two documents, with more than 5,000 listeners. In addition to all League members, propaganda was carried out to non-League youth. In the study, for the working League members with low cultural levels, the meaning was explained on the one hand, and literacy was taught on the other hand, which was very effective. Many League members said: "This method is good, we understand the truth and learn to read, and the listeners are willing to listen." After studying this document, they are now studying "The Chinese Revolution and the Chinese Communist Party," some are studying "On New Democracy," some are studying "Mao Zedong's Style," and some are studying "Labor Union Resolutions" and "The Tasks of Student Movement in North China and the Whole Country." The city's League is currently working hard to "eliminate illiteracy within the League," and school League members are working hard to "strive for an average of 70 points for each League member." In addition to ensuring participation in the general cultural learning of the trade union, some factory youth leagues have also organized cultural supplementary classes and united non-league youth to participate. As for technical learning, it is less because of the difficult conditions, but the Youth League of the Coking Branch and the Workers' Union combine, there is a technical learning once a week, explaining the preliminary theoretical knowledge in the business. Some workers with practical experience are also very interested in this, and the Railway Bureau also holds technical lectures, explaining some difficult technical problems for workers. Now technical learning is gradually being carried out, and has widely aroused the interest of factory League members, which is very important for improving production.

　　In addition, the entertainment of youth league members is also very lively under the principle of not hindering production and learning.

　　石家庄的新民主主义青年团
    ——华北第一届青代大会报告之一
    林燕英　安远荣
    石家庄市的青年团从开始建立到现在已有九个月的历史了。过去由于日寇和国民党长期的反动统治及其欺骗宣传，石家庄开始建立新民主主义青年团时，曾遭到很多困难。但由于党与民主政府各项政策的具体实施，革命形势的飞跃发展以及我们大量的宣传教育，青年的觉悟一天天地提高起来，青年们要求入团的呼声日益增多。
    一、从建团到现在
    建团前石家庄领导机关曾采取公开酝酿，用座谈会、讲演会及日报、墙报、黑板报等各种活泼有效的方式进行动员。去年六月石家庄日报发表了东北建团及边区联中建团的消息，接着在市立师范召开了二百人的各界青年、积极分子的座谈会，继又请冯文彬同志作了“中国青运与青年团”的报告，均起了很大效用。同时，根据青年的要求及兴趣，举办各种具体活动，如大兴纱厂的文化补习班，铁路局的技术学习班，学校的民主运动与社会活动。这样不仅进行了文化学习，而且加强了政治与组织的教育，并进行了思想酝酿，打下了建团的初步基础。由于缺乏经验及干部力量不足，因而建团初期，只采取了重点试建，再逐步扩大的方针。首先我们在大兴纱厂、市立师范、铁路局配备了干部，开始建团。与此同时，其他单位仍大量宣传普遍酝酿。由于重点建团取得了基本经验，青年觉悟大大提高，尤其在中央建团决议发表后，青年纷纷要求入团，于是我们便采取了比较普遍的发展，相继在炼焦厂、电话局、财政局等共九个公营工厂、四个中学及十二个市政企业和机关中，建立了团的组织，并在私营公厂、商店、街道与市效农村中，亦已开始试验建团，二区在棉织业中已建立团的组织，各区亦有团的支部。截至三月初止，全市已有十二个市团的直属总支，七十八个支部（区在内），一百六十四个小组，一千二百五十个团员了！其中职工团员占百分之六十，学生教员占百分之三十六，军人、市民、农民共占百分之四。
    我们在建团步骤上的经验是：必须首先以工人、学生为起点，扩展到区街和农村，由一点到数点，由片到面，由公营企业到私营企业，由市内到市郊，这个逐步扩大的方针，我们认为是正确的。
    然而，我们在建团过程中，由于某些单位，缺乏充分酝酿，方针路线不够明确，市团的领导不深入，个别建团干部急于求成，故曾发生过某些拉夫式地、无条件的大量发展（如炼焦厂）与秘密建团（如机厂）等偏向，以及某些无组织现象；但经发觉后，及时克服，这些偏向，现已基本上纠正或正在纠正着。
    当前全市青年团的组织，正在着重巩固、健全各级机构，建立与坚持会议、汇报制度，健全和充实小组会，进行有计划的学习，活跃团的生活。
    二、团员在各种战线上的作用
    全市一般团员在团的直接培养与教育下，积极响应了党与民主政府的各种号召，在各种生产、工作和学习中，均起了积极和先锋的作用，已成为党与民主政府的忠实助手。去年十月石家庄备战中，团员积极投入了备战工作。备战后，中共石家庄市委会对公营企业提出了增产补损的号召，各工厂的团员，踊跃地参加了生产竞赛，在竞赛运动中进一步树立了新的劳动态度，大兴纱厂的团员提出：“增加产量，节省原料，爱护机器，互相帮助”的口号，打破了“你不帮我，我也不帮你”的旧思想。团员权平金、张凤娟做完了自己的工作帮助别人接头上线，说：“你不帮我，我也帮助你。”在分车竞赛中多数团员得了红旗（奖旗），团员聂庆珍、张凤娟生产达到全场最高纪录——九次红旗，团员张凤仪受到九次表扬。姚起顺、白兰花为了争红旗，提出“咱们组里赛一赛，保证不跑车，不随便跑茅房，不练疙疸，不旷工，上工早，吃饭不误时间”的保证条件，这样不但自己得了红旗，而且带动了老男工冯广顺，也得了红旗。竞赛评判（十天一次）结果，团员得红旗的三十三人（没得红旗的是极少数），团员得红旗五次以上者十六个人，得红旗五次以下的十七个人。再如，铁路机厂的团员吴桂荣、吴过山，在增产运动中，组织了互助组，提高了产量，完成了任务。还如，电话局等部门的团员在竞赛运动中，均起了相当大的作用，许多团员得到奖励，保证了生产任务的完成，有的还超过了任务。
    各中等学校在十月备战后开展了学习竞赛，市立师范青年团提出，在年考时，团员的成绩争取平均分在七十分以上。二中青年团向各校青年团提出挑战，在竞赛学习中，不仅提高了团员自己的学习，而且还帮助了功课较差的同学补习功课。市师团员奎志仁，数学在竞赛前得零分，竞赛后提高到五十九分。郝慎丰代数在竞赛前不及格，竞赛后竟提高到九十分。各校团员均保证了学校教育计划的完成。去年年假前，各校选举学习模范生时，模范生大多数是团员，市师的六个全校模范生，都是团员，此外还团结了团外同学，节日外出，进行群众的宣传活动。
    其他机关、银行、市政企业、保安部队的团员，也均在各种不同的岗位上，起了积极作用，工作效率提高了。
    这些事实，均说明着全市团员，为着人民革命的事业，为建设人民的石家庄，付出了相当的贡献，起着不可忽视的作用。
    三、团的学习和生活
    团员们一般的在学习上的最大要求是学政治，学文化，学技术，一二两月份全市团员统统学习了中央建团决议及团章，为着掀起学习运动，市团筹委会曾举行十数次关于以上两文件的报告，听众五千余，除所有团员外，并对团外青年进行了宣传，学习中对文化低的工人团员，一面讲意思，一面教识字，收效很大，许多团员说：“这法子好，又懂得道理，又学了字，听的人也愿听”，学完这本文件后现有的学“中国革命与中国共产党”，有的学“新民主主义论”，有的学“毛泽东的作风”，也有的学“劳大决议”与“华北及全国学运的任务”。现全市团正为着“消灭团内文盲”而努力，学校团员正为着“争取每个团员平均七十分”而努力。工厂团员除保证参加工会一般文化学习外，某些工厂青年团又举办了文化补习班，并团结了团外青年参加。至于技术学习因限于条件困难，举办较少，但炼焦分厂青年团与职工会结合，每星期有一次技术学习，讲解业务中的初步理论知识，有些有实际经验的工人，对这也感到极大兴趣，铁路局还举办技术讲座会，讲解一些工人疑难的技术问题。现在技术学习正在逐步开展，已广泛的引起工厂青年团员的兴趣，这对提高生产颇有重要意义。
    另外青年团员的文娱在不妨碍生产和学习的原则下也搞得很热闹。
