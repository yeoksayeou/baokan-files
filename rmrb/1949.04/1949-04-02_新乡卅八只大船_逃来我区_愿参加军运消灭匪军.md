　　【Taihang Telegram】 (Delayed) The civilian boats on the Wei River, which were detained by Chiang Kai-shek's 40th Army inside Xinxiang city, have been fleeing to the Liberated Areas due to the oppression of the bandit troops. According to statistics from February 27th to March 4th, in six days, a total of thirty-eight large boats capable of carrying thirty tons fled to Jixian, with one hundred and seventy-eight boatmen and their families. The Jixian People's Government gave them condolences, and the Weihui store of the trading company lent them grain, organized them to transport coal and salt for production, and solved their current living difficulties. These fleeing boat people recounted their suffering when they were detained in Xinxiang by Chiang Kai-shek's bandits. They said that the Chiang Kai-shek bandits used the boats without paying wages, and did not even provide food. If the boats were damaged, they could not be repaired. The boat people relied on picking coal cinders and drinking two thin soups a day to maintain their lives. After arriving in the Liberated Area, they were very grateful for the enthusiastic help of the democratic government, and all said: When Xinxiang is attacked, we are willing to sail the boats to transport troops and grain to support the People's Liberation Army in eliminating the murderous bandit troops in Xinxiang.

　　新乡卅八只大船
  　逃来我区
  　愿参加军运消灭匪军
    【太行电】（迟到）被蒋匪四十军扣留在新乡城内的卫河民船，不堪匪军压迫，纷纷逃来解放区。据二月二十七日至三月四日六天统计，逃来汲县能载三十吨的大船共三十八艘，船夫及其家属一百七十八人。我汲县人民政府当予慰问，贸易公司卫辉商店并借给粮食，组织他们运煤、运盐生产，解决当前生活困难。这些逃来船民纷纷诉说他们在新乡被蒋匪扣留时的苦况。他们说，蒋匪使船不给工钱，连饭也不叫吃，船坏了也不能修。船民们靠拣煤渣，一天喝两顿稀汤维持生活。到解放区后，对民主政府的热情帮助非常感激，都说：打新乡时，我们情愿开船去运军队、运粮食，支援解放军消灭新乡的杀人匪军。
