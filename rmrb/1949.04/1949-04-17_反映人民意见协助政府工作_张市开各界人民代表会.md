In the future, after the period of military control ends, and after social order is completely stable and various municipal constructions have further developed, we will conduct democratic elections to establish a formal People's Representative Conference." Subsequently, Mayor Zhang Mengxu reported on the work of Zhangjiakou City in the past three and a half months and the tasks for 1949. The second day was devoted to group and plenary discussions, and the election of the chairman and vice-chairmen of the representative conference. During the discussions, everyone offered many valuable opinions to the People's Government, such as demanding the thorough crushing of the prestige of the puppet Baojia personnel, and factories should start work as soon as possible to settle unemployed female workers. There were also 73 written proposals. Finally, the representatives democratically elected Guo Chunlin, Zhang Fugui, and Chen Jun as the chairman and vice-chairmen of the All-Circles People's Representative Conference.
