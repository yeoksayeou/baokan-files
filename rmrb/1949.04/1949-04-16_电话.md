　　Telephone
    "Ring, ring, ring..." The telephone rings. Picking up the receiver, you can hear people talking from far away, just as if you were speaking face to face.
    It's strange. Two people are far apart, so why can you hear the speech so clearly and so close? What exactly is a telephone, and how can it transmit sound so far?
    On the telephone, where you speak, there is a very thin metal disc. When you speak, sound waves are produced in the air, and the metal disc vibrates according to the pitch and intensity of the sound waves. Each vibration causes an electrical current to travel to the electrode, which moves an electromagnet. The electromagnet then attracts another metal disc, causing it to vibrate in the same way and produce the same sound.
    The speed of electricity is very fast, and transmitting speech by electricity is much faster than transmitting speech through the air. Therefore, it only takes a fraction of a second to transmit from one end of the phone to the other.
    If you want to talk to a certain comrade, you connect a line to their location. But if you want to talk to thousands of people, you would need to connect thousands of lines. Wouldn't that be too expensive and too troublesome? In reality, such expense isn't necessary. Each telephone only has one line, which connects to the telephone exchange. The telephone exchange then connects you to the telephone you want to reach.
    The telephone exchange connects lines for you in two ways. One is the older method, where if you want to talk to a certain comrade, you must first call the operator at the telephone exchange, who then connects you to the telephone line you want. The other method is the automatic telephone, which is even more convenient. When you want to call someone, you only need to dial a specific number on the rotary dial once, and you can talk directly.

　　电话
    “呤呤呤……”，电话响了，拿起电话来，是可以听到老远的人说话，就和在当面说话一样。
    奇怪，两个人离开很远，为啥说话听得这么清楚这么近，电话究竟是什么玩艺儿，能将声音传得这么远呢？
    电话机上讲话的地方，有一块很薄的金属圆板，你一说话，空气中发生音波，金属圆板也随着音波的高低强弱而震动。每次震动就使电流走到电极的那一端，拨动一个电磁石，使电磁石再吸引一块金属圆板，因而发生同样的震动而发出了同样的声音。
    电流的速度是非常快的，用电流传话比空气传话要快得多。因此，从电话的这头到那头只要一秒钟的几分之一时间。
    倘若你要跟某位同志说话，便接一根线到他那里。那么，你要跟几千个人说话，就须要接几千根线，那不是太花费、太麻烦了吗？实际是不需要这样花费的，每个电话都只有一根线，通到电话局，由电话局来替你接上你所要的电话。
    电话局代你接线的方法有两种：一种是比较旧式的，假如你要跟某同志说话，得先叫电话局的接线生，再接到你所要的电话线上。还有一种是自动电话，那更方便了，你要叫谁时，只须将转盘按照一定的号码拨动一次，就可以直接通话。
