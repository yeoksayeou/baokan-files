　　Young Hero Li Guangzheng
  　Delegate to the First National Congress of the Youth League Introduction
    Long Teng　虞丹
    Among the military representatives at the First National Congress of the China New Democratic Youth League, there is a young deputy company commander named Li Guangzheng. He is only twenty-five years old this year, joined the army four years ago, and in the three years of the People's Liberation War, he has made seven great contributions to the people, won two bravery medals, one hero medal, and one most glorious Mao Zedong Medal, becoming a brilliant combat banner in the Fourth Field Army of the People's Liberation Army, and also a model member of the China New Democratic Youth League today.
    Comrade Li Guangzheng is from Jinwu County, Hebei Province, and comes from a working-class background. He suffered hardships in a coal mine during the puppet Manchukuo period, relying on physical labor to survive from the age of thirteen, working for eight years. This laid the foundation for his high degree of proletarian heroism of risking his life for the people, fighting hard with the enemy, and never retreating.
    In his heroic achievements, one thing people will never forget is his astonishing feat of continuously blasting twelve times overnight in the siege of Siping Street in 1947, destroying the enemy's Great Red Building. At that time, Comrade Li Guangzheng was the deputy squad leader of the eighth squad of the first company. When the higher-ups decided to eliminate the enemy's 263rd Regiment entrenched in the puppet court's Great Red Building in Siping Street, Comrade Li Guangzheng volunteered to lead the blasting team and take on the blasting task. The higher-ups granted his request and immediately prepared blasting equipment. During the day, he braved the intense enemy fire to blast down a brick wall on the assault road. As soon as it got dark, after squad leader Han Lixun blew up the barbed wire, he held the explosives and carried out two consecutive blasts, blowing a breach in one side of the building. The troops rushed into the building, but due to the enemy's fierce firepower, it was temporarily difficult to succeed, and many comrades were seriously injured. Comrade Li Guangzheng angrily vowed: "I will destroy the Great Red Building even if I die, to avenge the comrades!"
    He then held up the third package of explosives and blew a hole half a room in size in one side of the Great Red Building's wall, but the enemy was still stubbornly defending. After he carried out the fourth blast, the smoke choked his throat and nose, and the bricks and stones heavily flattened his helmet. He was also shaken unconscious. Later, he woke up slightly and crawled back with difficulty, dragging his sore body. Along the way, bullets whizzed past him, but he didn't care. When he was about to crawl back to the squad, he was so exhausted that he collapsed. He anxiously thought: "Li Guangzheng! Are you really done for? You haven't completed the task yet!" He also thought of the wounded comrades, and the flames of revenge burned fiercely in his chest. He endured the pain and mustered his spirits to crawl to the front of the building, appearing near the comrades. The comrades originally thought he had sacrificed, but when they saw him at this time, they were so happy that they quickly dragged him to a hidden place and gave him water. He lay on the ground in a daze. Suddenly, he heard the higher-ups assigning the blasting task to another squad, and immediately got up to see the instructor, saying: "Our eighth squad will continue to complete the task!" The instructor dissuaded him and told him to rest, but he refused to agree, picked up the explosives, and led the eighth squad soldiers to charge towards the enemy again, carrying out the fifth blast. In the middle, two more comrades in the squad were injured. Li Guangzheng and the remaining two soldiers were determined: "As long as there is one person left in the eighth squad, the blasting task cannot be snatched away by another squad!" In this way, from dark to dawn, Comrade Li Guangzheng, under the enemy's artillery fire and dense blockade of bullets, made twenty-four round trips, using more than two thousand catties of explosives, and continuously blasted twelve times, finally collapsing half of a three-story, two- to three-hundred-meter-long Great Red Building. At this time, he was the first to rush into the Red Building, and with two signalmen, captured the enemy's deputy regimental commander alive. The troops followed, and completely eliminated the enemy's 263rd Regiment. Comrade Li Guangzheng was awarded the Hero Medal.
    In the great Jinzhou campaign, Li Guangzheng once again created a brilliant battle example. At that time, he had been promoted to second platoon leader of the second company. The second company was tasked with deep battle missions. He led the second platoon, like a sharp knife following the deputy company commander, inserted into the city from the southeast of the old city, disrupting the enemy, and launched a pursuit battle.
    They chased all the way to the enemy's anti-tank gun position, where there was a company of enemies. Seeing the pursuing troops, they immediately climbed onto the roof and used firepower to hold off the second company. Comrade Li Guangzheng cleverly dispersed the troops, clinging to the base of the wall, and approached the enemy. At this time, the deputy company commander sacrificed himself, so he acted as the deputy company commander, commanding the entire company's small cannons, machine guns, and rifle grenades, firing at the roof, eliminating the enemy in a burst of fierce fighting. The second platoon continued to develop in depth, chasing to the front of a large courtyard, where an enemy battalion was stubbornly defending. Comrade Li Guangzheng, according to the terrain, deployed firepower, adopted the "one point, two sides" tactic, seriously and quickly requested the first platoon leader to lead the first platoon to encircle the enemy, and led the second platoon to attack into the courtyard from the front, annihilating all the enemies in a very short time.
    The second company pursued fiercely for eleven o'clock, chasing from the southeast of the city to the northwest, capturing nearly two thousand enemies at the cost of seven or eight casualties. After the war, all the comrades in the company unanimously requested the higher-ups to award him two major merits.
    After completely annihilating the Chiang bandits in the Northeast, Comrade Li Guangzheng followed the troops to North China to attack Tianjin. In order to reduce his own casualties, he followed the orders of his superiors and led the second company to dig a traffic trench overnight on the open ground two to three hundred meters away from the enemy's east city, building four bunkers as an attacking position, ensuring that brother troops could capture Tianjin.
    As soon as it dawned, the enemy discovered this position and bombarded it with fierce artillery fire, and launched continuous assaults, attempting to seize the position. Comrade Li Guangzheng was at the very front of the entire company, telling the second platoon to disperse in the traffic trench to repel the enemy. But the enemy was not reconciled, and organized a battalion of troops to attack the position, dozens of shells hit, collapsing the bunkers. Smoke filled the position, and Comrade Li Guangzheng was wounded in the shoulder. The second platoon leader wanted him to go down and rest, but he resolutely said: "It doesn't matter if I'm injured a little, comrades, fight calmly!" The soldiers, moved by his unparalleled bravery, expressed their determination to hold on, and repelled the enemy again in one go. They held on until night, repelling nine enemy assaults, and the position stood firm. The regimental committee announced on the spot that he had made a great contribution.
    Having participated in the three-year People's Liberation War and made great contributions, Comrade Li Guangzheng is now facing Jiangnan, he vowed to cross the Yangtze River, and continue to fight for the liberation of all of China, striving to make even greater achievements.

　　青年英雄李广正
  　青年团第一次全国代表大会代表介绍
    龙腾　虞丹
    在中国新民主主义青年团第一次全国代表大会的部队代表里，有一个年轻的副连长叫李广正，他今年才二十五岁，参军四年，在三年人民解放战争中，为人民立下了七大功，获得两个勇敢奖章，一个英雄奖章，和一个最光荣的毛泽东奖章，成为人民解放军第四野战军中一面光辉灿烂的战斗旗帜，也是今天中国新民主主义青年团中的一个模范团员。
    李广正同志是河北省津武县人，工人出身，伪满时曾在炭矿里受过千辛万苦，从十三岁起就靠卖力气过活，一直作了八年工。这些，打下了他为人民出死入生、和敌人艰苦搏斗，决不后退的高度的无产阶级英雄气概的基础。
    在他的英勇战绩里，人们永远不能忘记的一件，那就是一九四七年在四平街的攻坚战中，他一夜连续爆破十二次，炸毁敌人大红楼的惊人事迹。那时李广正同志是一连八班副班长。当上级决定要消灭龟缩在四平街里伪法院大红楼中的敌人二六三团时，李广正同志自报奋勇，要求领导爆破组担任爆破任务。上级允许了他的请求，立刻准备好爆破器材。白天，他冒着炽烈的敌火炸倒了冲锋道路上的一堵砖墙。天一黑，待等小组长韩立训炸开了铁丝网，他就抱起炸药，连续进行了两次爆破，把大楼的一边炸出了个突破口，队伍冲进大楼，由于敌人火力猛烈，暂时不易得手，不少同志负了重伤。李广正同志气愤地宣誓：“我死也要炸毁大红楼，为同志们报仇！”
    他又抱起第三包炸药，把大红楼一边墙壁炸开半间房大的窟窿，但敌人仍在顽守着。当他进行第四次爆破后，硝烟呛着他的喉咙、鼻子，砖石沉重地打扁了他的钢盔，他也被震动得人事不知。后来他稍一苏醒，拖着酸疼的身体，吃力地往回爬。一路上，子弹嗖嗖地在他身边擦过，他不管这些。当他快爬到班上时，全身疲乏得软摊了，他着急的想：“李广正啊！你真的完了吗？你还没有完成任务啊！”又想起负伤的同志，复仇的火焰熊熊地在心胸中燃起，他忍痛强振起精神爬到大楼前边，出现在同志们的近处。同志们原以为他已牺牲了，这时一见到他，高兴得连忙把他拖到隐蔽地，给他喝水。他迷迷糊糊地躺在地上。突然听到上级在向别班交待爆破任务，立即爬起来去见指导员，说：“我们八班要继续完成任务！”指导员劝止他，叫他休息，他不答应，抱起炸药带领八班战士又冲向敌人，进行了第五次爆破。中途，班内又有两个同志负伤了，李广正和剩下的两个战士下决心：“只要八班有一个人，爆破任务就不能被别班抢去！”就这样，从黑夜到天亮，李广正同志在敌人炮火、枪弹密集的封锁下，来回二十四趟，用了两千多斤炸药，连续爆破十二次，终于把一座三层高、二三百米长的大红楼炸塌了一半。这时他第一个冲进红楼，和两个通讯员生俘敌人副团长。队伍随后跟上，全部解决了敌人第二六三团。李广正同志挂上了英雄奖章。
    伟大的锦州战役中，李广正再次创造了光辉战例。那时他已升为二连二排长。二连担任纵深战斗任务。他带领二排跟着副连长象一把锋利的尖刀似地，从旧城东南插入城内，把敌人打乱了套，就发起追击战。
    一气追到敌人的一个战防炮阵地，那里有一个连的敌人，见到追击部队，马上爬上屋顶，用火力顶住二连。李广正同志机灵地把队伍散开，紧贴墙根，逼近敌人。这时副连长牺牲了，他便代理副连长指挥全连小炮、机枪、枪榴弹，齐向屋顶开火，一阵猛打，消灭了敌人。二排继续向纵深发展，追到一个大院前，院内有敌人一个营在顽守着。李广正同志按照地形，配备好火力，采用“一点两面”战术，严肃而迅速地请一排长带领一排迂回包围敌人，自己带二排在正面攻进大院，在很短时间内，就全歼了敌人。
    二连猛追十一点钟，从城东南直追到城西北，以七、八人伤亡的代价，俘虏了将近两千敌人。战后，全连同志异口同声地请求上级给他记了两大功。
    全歼东北蒋匪后，李广正同志跟着部队到了华北，攻打天津。为了减少自己伤亡，他遵照上级命令，带领二连在离敌人东城二、三百米的开阔地上挖了一夜交通壕，筑起四个地堡，作为攻城阵地，保证兄弟部队攻取天津。
    天刚亮，敌人发现了这阵地，以猛烈炮火轰击，并且发起连续的冲锋，企图夺取阵地。李广正同志在全连的最前面，叫二排疏散在交通壕内，击退了敌人。但敌人并不死心，又组织一个营的兵力进攻阵地，几十颗炮弹打过来，把地堡打塌了。阵地上烟火弥漫，李广正同志肩上负了伤，二排长要他下去休息，他坚决地说：“伤一点不要紧，同志们沉着打！”战士们在他无比的英勇感动下，表示了坚守的决心，一鼓作气把敌人又一次打退了。他们一直坚守到夜晚，打退敌人九次冲锋，阵地屹立不动。当场团委宣布他立大功。
    参加了三年人民解放战争，立下了伟大功劳的李广正同志，现在又面向江南，他宣誓要打过长江，为了解放全中国而继续战斗，争取立更大的功绩。
