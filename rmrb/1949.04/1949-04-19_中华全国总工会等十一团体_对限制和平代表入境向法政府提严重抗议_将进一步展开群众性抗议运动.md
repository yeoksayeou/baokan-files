Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 18th: Chinese people's organizations participating in the Paris World Congress of Supporters of Peace were extremely indignant upon learning that the French government was restricting the number of delegates from each country. The All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the All-China Youth Federation of Liberated Areas, the All-China Students' Federation, the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, the China Association of Scientific Workers, the All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, the North China Literary and Art Circles Association, the China Association of Academic Workers, the China Liberated Areas Journalists Association, the China Youth Journalists Society, and the Shanghai People's Organizations Joint Conference, a total of eleven people's organizations, held a meeting at 2:00 PM today at the All-China Federation of Trade Unions in Beiping for this purpose. They decided to lodge a strong protest against the French government's unreasonable action and passed a protest letter on the spot. The meeting decided that the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, the All-China Students' Federation, the Preparatory Committee of the All-China Congress of Literary and Art Workers, and the China Liberated Areas Journalists Association would form a temporary committee to further launch a mass protest movement to support the delegates from various countries who are being blocked. The protest letter from the eleven people's organizations has been telegraphed to Mr. Aragon, Chairman of the Preparatory Committee of the Paris World Congress of Supporters of Peace, for transmission to the French government. The full text is as follows:

Mr. Aragon, Chairman of the Preparatory Committee of the Paris World Congress of Supporters of Peace: We are extremely indignant upon learning of the French government's decision to limit the number of delegates from each country attending the World Congress of Supporters of Peace in Paris. We express our strong protest against this action by the French government. The protest letter is telegraphed as follows:

The Chinese people's organizations, which sent forty delegates to participate in the Paris World Congress of Supporters of Peace, are extremely indignant upon learning that the French government is unreasonably restricting the number of delegates allowed to enter the country to no more than eight per country.

The Chinese people's organizations, who love peace, express their strong protest to the French government for this action and demand that the French government immediately rescind this unreasonable decision and allow the peace delegations from various countries to arrive in Paris freely to hold the meeting according to the original number. We believe that this unreasonable decision by the French government violates the will of the French people. Therefore, we hope that the French people will protest together with us and demand that the French government change this decision. We unanimously believe that the French government's adoption of this decision only places it on the same reactionary position as the American government, which is trying its best to undermine this meeting, and that it is standing against world peace and preparing for a war of aggression. It only shows that the reactionary governments of these aggressive countries are extremely afraid of the peace forces of the people of all countries. We believe that no matter how the reactionaries of various countries obstruct it, the peace-loving people of the world have already demonstrated and will continue to demonstrate their united will and power to fight to the end to defend world peace. We believe that this united will and power is sufficient to defeat all the malicious conspiracies of the new war instigators to undermine peace.

　　中华全国总工会等十一团体
    对限制和平代表入境向法政府提严重抗议
    将进一步展开群众性抗议运动
    【新华社北平十八日电】参加巴黎世界拥护和平大会的中国各人民团体，在闻悉法国政府限制各国代表人数的消息后，极为愤慨。中华全国总工会、中国解放区青年联合会、中华全国学生联合会、中华全国民主妇女联合会、中国科学工作者协会、中华全国文艺协会、华北文艺界协会、中国学术工作者协会、中国解放区新闻记者联合会、中国青年记者学会、上海人民团体联合会等十一个人民团体，为此特于今日下午二时在北平全国总工会集会，决定对法政府此种无理举动提出严重抗议，并于当场通过了抗议书。会议决定由中华全国总工会、中华全国民主妇女联合会、中华全国学生联合会、中华全国文学、艺术工作者代表大会筹委会、中国解放区新闻记者联合会等五个团体组成临时委员会，以进一步展开群众性的抗议运动，声援各国被阻代表。十一个人民团体的抗议书已电告巴黎世界拥护和平大会筹委会主席阿拉贡转交法国政府。兹录其全文如下：
    巴黎世界拥护和平大会筹委会主席阿拉贡先生：我们闻悉法国政府限制各国派赴世界拥护和平大会的代表人数这一消息以后，不胜愤慨。我们对法政府此举表示严重抗议。兹将抗议书电告如下：
    派出四十名代表参加巴黎世界拥护和平大会的中国各人民团体，闻悉法国政府毫无理由地限制各国入境代表人数不能超过八人的消息以后，不胜愤慨。
    中国爱好和平的各人民团体向法国政府此举表示严重的抗议，要求法国政府立即取消此项无理决定，允许各国的和平代表团按照原有人数自由地到达巴黎举行会议。我们相信法国政府此项无理决定是违反法国人民意志的，因此，我们希望法国人民和我们一致抗议，并要求法国政府改变此种决定。我们一致认为：法国政府采取此项决定，只是会把法国政府与竭力破坏这一会议的美国政府一样，是站在反对世界和平和准备侵略战争的反动立场上，只是表明这些侵略国家的反动政府极端地害怕各国人民的和平力量。我们相信：无论各国反动派怎样阻挠，世界爱好和平的人民是已经表现了并将继续表现自己的团结一致的意志和威力，为保卫世界和平奋斗到底。我们相信：这种团结一致的意志和威力足以战胜新战争挑拨者破坏和平的一切恶毒阴谋。
