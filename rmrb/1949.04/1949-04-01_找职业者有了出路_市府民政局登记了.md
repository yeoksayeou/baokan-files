　　Job Seekers Find a Way Out: Registration at the Municipal Civil Affairs Bureau

Messrs. Wang Fusheng, Zhao Jiachang, Geng Hongbin, Wang Zixin, Wu Qiyi, Sun Qiwu, Li Huo, Li Guang, Li Shuchun, Zhao Min, Gao Wanqing, Wang Yubing, Zhao Ying, Sun Shixu, Xie Yi, Liu Guangtian, Liu Shugong, Zhang Wenbin, Wang Yun'gong, Wang Shanling, Tian Keqin, Peng Chichang, Liu Jinting, Li Hou＠, Cui Zhengxuan, Su Wenqing, and Zhu Yulin:

　　Your letters have been received. The following is a comprehensive response to your employment issues:

　　(1) Location, Time, and Procedures for Registration

　　The Social Service Department of the Beijing Municipal People's Government Civil Affairs Bureau has begun registering unemployed technical personnel to assist in resolving their employment problems. You should proceed to register. The registration location is No. 286 Damochang, Qianmenwai, Beijing. The registration time is from 9:00 AM to 6:00 PM daily. The registration procedure is very simple, requiring only the completion of a registration form.

　　(2) Can a Job Be Found Immediately?

　　It is difficult to provide a definite answer to this question. We have discussed it with comrades from the Social Service Department of the Beijing Municipal Government. Their opinion is that it must be determined based on the urgency of the need for personnel from all parties and your own qualifications. However, we can tell you that the Social Service Department of the Civil Affairs Bureau maintains contact with various government agencies and public and private factories. After you register, they will make every effort to introduce you to a job based on your qualifications. If there are any results, you will be notified by special letter. But do not passively sit at home and wait; you should actively seek solutions from all sides.

　　(3) Job Placement is Easier Outside the City

　　Currently, the various agencies and factories in the city do not need many personnel. However, many industrial, political, and educational departments in outlying areas are in great need of personnel. If you are willing to leave the city to work in other areas, your employment problem will be easier to solve.

　　(4) Is it a Supply System or a Salary System?

　　At present, with the exception of enterprise departments, most still use the supply system. This is because we cannot overburden the people. Therefore, it is still difficult to fully implement a salary system, but it will be implemented soon. At the same time, the standard of this salary system will gradually increase as the general social living standard improves.

　　找职业者有了出路　市府民政局登记了
    王复生、赵家昌、耿宏斌、王自新、吴奇一、孙栖梧、李活、李光、李树春、赵敏、高婉清、王玉冰、赵英、孙世勖、谢毅、刘广田、刘树功、张文彬、王允恭、王珊玲、田克勤、彭炽昌、刘金亭、李厚＠、崔政宣、苏文卿、朱玉麟诸先生：
    来信收到，对你们的职业问题，综合答复如下：
    （一）登记的地点、时间和手续
    北平市人民政府民政局社会服务处，为协助解决失业技术人员的职业问题，已开始办理该项人员登记。你们应前往进行登记，登记地点在北平市前门外打磨厂二八六号，登记时间是每日上午九时至下午六时，登记手续，只填写一张登记表，非常简单。
    （二）能否立刻找到职业？
    这个问题很难做肯定的答复，我们曾向北平市政府社会服务处的同志商谈过，他们意见必须根据各方需用人员的缓急，与你们本身的各种条件来决定。但可告诉你们，民政局社会服务处，与各机关，和各公私营工厂等，都保有一定的联系，你们登记之后，便可根据你们的条件，尽量设法予以介绍职业，如有结果，便以专函通知。但千万不要消极的坐在家里等待，应主动从各方面想些办法。
    （三）如能到市区以外，职业就较易解决。
    目前情况，在市内各机关工厂都已不需要很多人员，但外区有很多工业部门、政权及教育部门，都很需要人员，你们如能离开本市到外地工作，职业问题就更容易解决些。
    （四）是供给制还是薪金制？
    在目前，除了企业部门外，一般的还都是供给制，因为要使人民负担不能过重，所以完全实行薪金制还有很多困难，但不久即要实行薪金制。同时这种薪金制的标准也会根据一般社会生活水平的提高而逐渐提高的。
