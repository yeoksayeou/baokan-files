The Beiping Municipal Government Holds Meeting for New and Old Staff

Mayor Ye Encourages Diligent Work

Emphasizes Strengthening Learning and Striving for Progress

[Reported by this newspaper] Beiping Mayor Ye Jianying convened a meeting of over two thousand new and old staff members from various bureaus, institutes, and banks of the Municipal Government at the Fourth Middle School on the 9th. Mayor Ye first explained the changes in the current situation, stating: "After two and a half years of heroic and bloody battles in the Chinese People's Liberation War, we have completely seized the political and military initiative in the hands of the people. We can now use military or political methods to resolve the liberation issue of most of China that has not yet been resolved." The reason why the people have been able to obtain this complete initiative is due to the complete annihilation of the enemy's main forces in the Liaoshen, Huaihai, and Pingjin campaigns. Regarding the peace issue, Mayor Ye said: "Now, peace is the desire of all Chinese people, and it is also the desire of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army, because a peaceful resolution can preserve manpower and material resources to build our New Democratic country. However, reactionary rulers in history have never been willing to automatically hand over the power to oppress the people to the people; they all require armed struggle. But when the revolutionary people have a stronger military force than the enemy, they can demand that the problem be solved without force and bloodshed. However, it is inconceivable to seek peace with the rulers without a strong revolutionary armed force." Mayor Ye also said: "Now that the time for nationwide victory is approaching, we must carry the revolution through to the end, so that the Chinese people will be liberated forever and stand strong in the world. This is something we cannot waver on in the slightest."

When Mayor Ye mentioned the work attitude of the Municipal Government staff, he said: "The comrades of the Municipal Government are serving the people under the people's regime. We will respectfully do whatever the people want us to do. Now is the era of the people, the era of New Democracy. The people must concentrate all their efforts on supporting Chairman Mao's peace proposals and at the same time carry out national construction." Regarding the issue of the staff's living standards, he said: "The war has not yet ended, and it is impossible to have abundant materials to provide for us. Moreover, our living standards should not and cannot exceed the treatment of ordinary people, especially workers, by several times. In order to solve our own living problems, we should mobilize our relatives to participate in production work. Except for the disabled, the elderly, the young, and those who need to study and cannot support themselves, everyone, regardless of whether they are educated or uneducated, skilled or unskilled, must participate in the production front." Mayor Ye emphasized: "All parasites who rely on others for a living should be corrected in the era of the people. All staff members should see those who are struggling on the streets and are more hardship than us, and should consider that their lives cannot exceed the lives of ordinary people."

Finally, Mayor Ye encouraged all levels of staff to study diligently the combination of Marxist theory and the practice of the Chinese revolution, which is often studied by communists, and to learn the communist way of looking at problems—dialectical materialism. Study the history of the Chinese revolution and the struggle of the Chinese Communist Party, and arm your minds well with Marxism. When talking about the attitude of a revolutionary worker, Mayor Ye asked everyone not to succumb in the face of violence, but to bow their heads in the face of truth. He also quoted the famous saying of the writer Lu Xun: "Fierce-browed, I coolly face a thousand pointing fingers, Head-bowed, I gladly serve as an ox for the children." In the concluding remarks of Mayor Ye's speech, he advised the new and old staff: Strive to transform yourselves and create a person needed by the people! (Loud applause) The meeting ended at 3:30 pm.

　　北平市府开新旧职员大会
  　叶市长勉刻苦工作
    强调加强学习努力进步
    【本报讯】北平市叶剑英市长，于九日召集市政府各局、院、行等新旧职员两千余人在第四中学讲话，叶市长首在说明时局的变化时称：中国人民解放战争经过两年半以来的英勇血战的结果，完全将政治上军事上的主动权掌握在人民手里，我们现在可以用军事方法或用政治方法来解决目前尚未解决的大半个中国的解放问题。人民之所以能够获得此完全主动权，是由于辽沈、淮海、平津三大战役，把敌人主力军全部歼灭的结果。关于和平问题叶市长说：现在和平是全中国人民的愿望，也是中国共产党和人民解放军的愿望，因为和平解决可以保存人力物力来建设我们的新民主主义国家。但是，历史上的反动统治者，从来不愿将压迫人民的政权自动的交给人民的，都是要经过武装斗争的，但是到了革命的人民掌握有比敌人更加强大的武力时，就可以要求不用武力，不用流血来解决问题，可是没有强大的革命武装，而想和统治者求和是不能设想的。叶市长又称：现在快要到全国胜利的时候了，我们要把革命进行到底，使中国人民永远的翻身，使中国人民在世界上坚强的站起来，这点是我们丝毫不能动摇的。
    叶市长提到市府人员工作的态度问题时说：市政府的同志们是在人民的政权下为人民服务的，人民要什么我们就恭恭敬敬的给人民作什么，现在是人民的时代，是新民主主义的时代，人民必须集中全力拥护毛主席的和平主张，同时进行国家的建设。对工作人员生活待遇问题，他说：现在战争并未结束，不可能有优裕的物质来供给我们，而且我们的生活不应亦不能超过一般人特别是工人待遇的若干倍以上，为了解决自己的生活问题，应当动员自己的亲属参加到生产工作中去，除了残废、老年、幼年及需要学习不能自食其力的以外，不论有文化的没有文化的有技术的没有技术的，都要参加到生产战线上去。叶市长着重地指出：一切依靠别人来生活的寄生虫，在人民的时代里应当得到纠正，一切工作人员应当看到比我们更坚苦的流落在街头上的人，应当盘算自己的生活不能超过普通人的生活。
    叶市长最后劝勉各级职员努力学习共产党人所经常学习的马克思主义的理论与中国革命实践的结合，学习共产党人看问题的方法——辩证唯物论。学习中国革命与中国共产党奋斗的历史，好好地用马克思主义把自己的头脑武装起来。叶市长在谈到一个革命工作人员的态度时要求大家在强暴的面前不要屈服，在真理的面前便要低头。他并引证了文学家鲁迅先生的名言：“横眉冷对千夫指，俯首甘为孺子牛”。在叶市长讲话的结束语中忠告新旧工作人员：努力改造自己造成一个为人民所需要的人。（大鼓掌）大会至下午三时半结束。 　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　（陈勇进）
