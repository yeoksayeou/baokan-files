Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 23rd — The number one war criminal, Chiang Kai-shek, has openly stepped forward to lead the Kuomintang reactionary government in continuing the counter-revolutionary civil war. On the 22nd, Chiang Kai-shek flew from Xikou to Hangzhou. The pseudo-Acting President Li Zongren, pseudo-Executive Yuan President He Yingqin, pseudo-Hunan Provincial Chairman Cheng Qian, Hua Zhong pseudo-Military and Political Commander Bai Chongxi, pseudo-Chief of Staff Gu Zhutong, pseudo-Chongqing Pacification Office Director Zhang Qun, pseudo-Defense Minister Xu Yongchang, pseudo-Legislative Yuan President Tong Guanxian, pseudo-Kyong Hu-Hang Garrison Commander Tang Enbo, Jiangsu pseudo-Provincial Chairman Ding ZhiPan, Anhui pseudo-Provincial Chairman Zhang Yi Chun, Jiangxi pseudo-Provincial Chairman Fang Tian, Henan pseudo-Provincial Chairman Zhang Zhen and others also flew from Nanjing, Guangzhou, Hankou, Changsha and other places to Hangzhou upon Chiang's orders. The Associated Press reported that Chiang summoned Li, He, and others to Hangzhou to meet and "discuss the comprehensive operational plan for the final battle." Li Zongren immediately appointed He Yingqin to replace Xu Yongchang as pseudo-Defense Minister. At the same time, the "Kuomintang Central Executive Committee" in Guangzhou is planning to have Chiang Kai-shek completely shed his "retirement" guise and return to power to lead the Kuomintang reactionaries. According to a Guangzhou Associated Press dispatch on the 21st, the association is arranging to welcome Chiang Kai-shek back and has issued a large number of slogans and leaflets "welcoming" Chiang Kai-shek to Guangzhou to lead the Kuomintang in battle. Gu Zhengding, Minister of the Central Organization Department of the Kuomintang, has flown from Guangzhou to Xikou to discuss the matter with Chiang.
