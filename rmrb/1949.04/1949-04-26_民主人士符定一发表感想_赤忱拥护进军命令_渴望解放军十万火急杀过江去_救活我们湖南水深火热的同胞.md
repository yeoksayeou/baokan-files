　　[Special Dispatch] Democratic figure Mr. Fu Dingyi expressed his sentiments yesterday regarding Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu's order to annihilate the enemy. He wrote: "After reading Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu's order of April 21st, I feel that their words about resolutely, cleanly, and completely annihilating the enemy are sincere and indeed exciting and delightful, nothing could be better. Our Chinese revolution has been going on for thirty-eight years, and because the doctrine was not good, and the people implementing the doctrine were hypocritical, things have only gotten worse. Now, Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu are implementing the peaceful agreement with resolute and thorough means, vigorously promoting New Democracy, and liberating all of China. They are driving out the traitorous warlords, secret agents, and war criminals to the best of their ability. With the liberation of the whole country, everyone will be free from oppression; with increased production throughout the country, everyone will have a livelihood. Such a revolution is entirely for the people, and the people cannot help but like it and support it. Since the order to annihilate all the enemies was issued on the 21st of this month, it is said that more than 300,000 troops crossed the Yangtze River that day. By the 22nd, the good news of the river crossing spread, with a million troops. By the evening of the 23rd, a telegram announced the liberation of Nanjing. This kind of victorious rapid advance is proof of the military and civilians desperately supporting Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu's order. I am an old commoner from Hunan, eagerly awaiting the People's Liberation Army to cross the river in great numbers, fiercely, and with utmost speed, to save our compatriots in Hunan from their dire straits. I am also a person who writes books to pass on to future generations, and my position is perhaps a little higher than that of the three elders of Huguan during Liu Bang's time, and I am unwilling to speak lightly. Today, feeling grateful for the merits of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, I cannot help but say a few words to express my sincere support. April 24th."

　　民主人士符定一发表感想
  　赤忱拥护进军命令
    “渴望解放军十万火急杀过江去
  　救活我们湖南水深火热的同胞”
    【本报特讯】民主人士符定一氏，昨日对毛主席朱总司令的歼敌命令，发表感想。他自己写道：“读了毛主席朱总司令四月二十一日的命令，觉他们所云坚决干净全部歼灭敌人，字字真切，的确令人兴奋痛快，再好没有。我们中国革命三十八年矣，因主义不好，实行主义的人们，又是挂羊头卖狗肉，所以愈弄愈坏。现在毛主席朱总司令以坚决彻底的手段，实行和平协定，厉行新民主主义，解放全中国。把祸国殃民的土匪军阀，特务战犯，驱除务尽。全国解放，人人不受压迫；全国增产，人人都有生活。如此革命，完全是为人民，人民没有不喜欢的，没有不拥护的。自本月二十一日发出歼灭全部敌人的命令，是日渡过长江的军队，闻有三十万之多。到二十二日，则渡江的捷报，传有百万大军。到二十三晚，则电告南京解放。这种胜利的狂飞猛进，就是军民拚命拥护毛主席朱总司令命令的证明。我是湖南的一个老百姓，渴望解放军多多的、猛烈的、十万火急的杀过江去，救活我们湖南水深火热的同胞，我又是一个著书传后的人，比那刘邦时的壶关三老，地位或者高一点，不愿意轻于说话。今天感戴毛主席朱总司令的功德，不能不略说几句，以表示赤忱的拥护。四月二十四日。”
