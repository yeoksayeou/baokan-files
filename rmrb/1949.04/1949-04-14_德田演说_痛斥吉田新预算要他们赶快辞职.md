　　Tokuda's Speech
  　Vigorously Condemns Yoshida's New Budget, Demanding Their Immediate Resignation
    [Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 10th] Reports from various sources: From the 5th to the 7th, the Japanese Diet questioned the budget report proposed by Yoshida Shigeru. Tokuda Kyuichi, General Secretary of the Japanese Communist Party, in his speech, vehemently denounced Yoshida as the "greatest traitor." Tokuda pointed out that Yoshida has abandoned his campaign promise of reducing taxes. Due to his betrayal, Japan's railway, telecommunications, and other enterprises will fall into the hands of foreign capitalists, and the petroleum industry is already out of Japanese hands. The Japanese economy is facing a desperate situation. After denouncing Yoshida for hindering Japan's recovery, Tokuda demanded the Yoshida Cabinet's "total resignation."
    The Japanese Diet opened on March 19th. However, during the process of "requesting instructions" from MacArthur Headquarters, MacArthur's financial advisor Dodge repeatedly criticized Yoshida's draft report, causing the report to be submitted to the Diet as late as the 4th of this month. In his new budget report for this year (from April 1st to the end of March next year), Yoshida estimated the total annual revenue at 704.8 billion yen and expenditure at 704.6 billion yen. Reversing his promise to reduce income tax and other taxes, Yoshida implemented a heavy tax policy, stipulating that 72 percent of the total revenue would come from taxes. Among the expenditure items, the openly declared occupation costs alone amounted to more than 125 billion yen, and police expenses doubled compared to the previous year. The introduction of this reactionary budget案 not only aroused opposition from progressive public opinion, but even conservative newspapers criticized it. In the Diet, many members of reactionary parties such as the Socialist Party and the Democratic Party also expressed their opposition.

　　德田演说
  　痛斥吉田新预算要他们赶快辞职
    【新华社北平十日电】各方报道：日本议会于五日至七日，对吉田茂提出的预算报告，进行质问。日共总书记德田球一在演说中痛斥吉田为“最大的卖国贼”。德田指出吉田已背弃他竞选中关于减轻赋税的诺言。由于他的出卖行为，日本铁道、电信等企业，均将落于外国资本家之手，石油工业，则已经不在日人手中。日本经济已面临绝境。德田在指斥吉田妨碍日本的恢复后，要求吉田内阁“总辞职”。
    日本议会是三月十九日开幕的。但由于在向麦克阿瑟总部“请示”的过程中，麦氏的财政顾问道奇对吉田的报告草案曾数度予以批驳，致是项报告迟至本月四日始向议会提出。吉田在其本年度（自四月一日起至明年三月底止）新预算报告中，估计全年的总收入为七千零四十八亿日元，支出为七千零四十六亿日元。吉田一反其减轻所得税及其他赋税的诺言，实行重税政策，规定总收入中百分之七十二来自捐税。在支出项目中，公开的占领费一项即达一千二百五十余亿日元，警察费则较上年度增加一倍。这一反动预算案提出后，不仅引起进步舆论的反对，连保守的报纸亦加斥责。在议会中，反动政党如社会党与民主党的许多议员，也表示反对。
