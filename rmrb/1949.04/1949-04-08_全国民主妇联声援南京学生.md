Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 7th. The All-China Democratic Women's Federation passed a telegram of support for the Nanjing students the day before yesterday. The telegram said: "To the peace and democracy-loving students of Nanjing: Just as the first National Congress of Chinese Women concluded, news arrived of the Nanjing reactionary government's massacre, arrest, and injury of over two hundred students. This bloody incident has aroused the anger of all the delegates at the congress. The so-called sincerity for peace of the Nanjing Kuomintang reactionary government is truly revealed.

Your six thousand students' demonstration represents the will of the entire nation for genuine peace. We, representing the democratic women of all of China, assure you: we will use all our strength to support the People's Liberation Army in crossing the Yangtze River to liberate you and the two hundred million compatriots of southern China. The blood debt of the war criminals who slaughtered the people must be repaid double."

　　全国民主妇联声援南京学生
    【新华社北平七日电】中国民主妇女联合会前日通过声援南京学生的通电一件。通电说：南京爱好和平民主的同学们：正当中国妇女第一次全国代表大会闭幕的时候，传来了南京反动政府屠杀、逮捕、打伤二百多同学的消息。这个血案，激起了大会全体代表的愤怒。南京国民党反动政府的所谓和平诚意，原来如此。
    你们六千同学的游行示威，代表了全国人民要求真正和平底意志。我们代表全中国民主的妇女向你们保证：我们将以全力支援人民解放军渡江南进来解放你们和江南的两万万同胞，战犯们屠杀人民的血债一定要加倍偿还。
