　　Taihang Telegram: The people of Northern Henan are actively repairing the Daokou-Qinghua Railway. The track section from Jiaozuo to Xiuwu (40 li) was completely laid by March 15th. After the government issued the mobilization order to repair the railway, workers and the broad masses of farmers actively participated in this construction work, and everyone's enthusiasm was extremely high. The railway needed new-made sleepers, spikes, fishplates, and screws, and these problems were solved by the workers and farmers. Large and small vehicles transporting sleepers from the surrounding villages came one after another all day long, piling the sleepers up like mountains. When the road repair work was being prepared, there were only 50 people, but it quickly increased to 450. There were more than 100 oven workers in the Jiaozuo Railway Station South Factory, who worked day and night to rush to produce fishplates and spikes. The workers in the North Factory were rushing to make screws. In order to open the railway to traffic as soon as possible, the speed of their work was rapidly increased. At first, each shift of eight hours only produced more than 20 sets, but it quickly increased to 90 to 100 sets. The increase in production ensured the progress of the track laying work. The laying started from Jiaozuo towards Xiuwu on March 1st and was completed on the 15th. The daily speed reached three to four li. In order to increase the speed of road laying, the track laying workers have advanced their work from 6:00 am to 5:00 am starting from the 11th of this month, and only left work at 9:00 pm. Therefore, the plan to reach Xiuwu was completed on schedule. It is now continuing to be built eastward, and trains are running between Jiaozuo and Xiuwu all day long to transport equipment.

　　豫北广大人民
  　抢修道清路
    【太行电】豫北人民正在积极修复道清铁路，焦作至修武段（四十华里）路轨已于三月十五日完全铺好。当政府修复铁路的动员令下来后，工人与广大农民都积极地参加了这一建设工作，大家的情绪极高。铁路需用的枕木、道钉、夹板、螺丝钉都需新制，这些问题为工人与农民解决了。从四乡运送枕木的大小车辆一辆接一辆的整日不断，使枕木象山一样的堆起来，修路工作筹备时只有五十人，很快便增至四百五十名。焦作车站南厂有一百多烘炉工人，日以继夜的赶制夹板与道钉。北厂的工人则是赶制螺丝钉，他们为了提早通车，工作速度是飞速地提高，起初每班八小时只造二十余套，很快即增至九十套到一百套。产量的提高，保证了铺轨工作的进行。自三月一日开始从焦作往修武铺，到十五日即完成。每日速度达三至四华里。铺轨工人为增加铺路速度，自本月十一日起即从早六时上工提前为早五时，晚上九时才下工。因而按期完成了通往修武的计划。现正继续向东修筑，火车为了运送器材也整日驰奔于焦作修武间。
