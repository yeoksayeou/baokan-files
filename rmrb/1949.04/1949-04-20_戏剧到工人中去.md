　　Drama Goes to the Workers
    Shi Dao
    In the past month, the literary and art troupe's performances of famous dramas such as "Chi Ye He" (Red Leaf River) and "The White Haired Girl" in Beiping have won unanimous praise from society. However, I have two suggestions regarding this:
    1. In the past, the audience in Beiping was almost entirely made up of civil servants and students, and very few of the working masses from factories went to see them. The reason for this is that most factories are located in the suburbs, and workers cannot come to the city to see plays after work. As for Sundays, it is even more crowded and difficult to buy tickets, with the result that workers receive very little education from these new operas. Therefore, I suggest that in the future, the literary and art troupe should perform in rotation in the suburban areas of Shijingshan, Changxindian, Fengtai, and the eastern suburban industrial area, so that workers can all receive new literary and artistic education.
    2. The literary and art troupe has been in the countryside for a long time and has many scripts depicting rural situations. However, now that it has come to the city, there are very few scripts with factories as the subject matter. Therefore, I suggest that the literary and art troupe go to the factories, have more contact with the workers, and write some scripts with workers as the theme. This is urgently needed to raise workers' awareness and to build a future industrialized country.

　　戏剧到工人中去
    史道
    文艺工作团一月来在北平演出“赤叶河”“白毛女”等名剧，已博得社会一致好评，可是我对此有两点建议：
    一、过去在北平演出时，观众几乎都是公务员学生等，一般工厂中的劳动大众去看的很少，其原因是工厂大多在郊外，工人下班后不能进城观剧。至于星期日，那更是挤得买不到票，结果工人们得到这些新歌剧的教育的很少。所以我建议以后文工团应在郊区石景山、长辛店、丰台、东郊工业区轮流演出，使工人们都能领受新的文艺教育。
    二、文艺工作团久处农村，描写农村情形的剧本很多，可是现在走进城市来了，以工厂为题材的剧本却很少，因此我建议文工团到工厂去，多与工人接触，编写些以工人为主题的剧本，这在提高工人觉悟和将来建设工业化的国家是迫切需要的。
