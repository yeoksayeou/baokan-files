Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, April 28th: When the Kuomintang bandit gangs prepared to flee and carry out large-scale sabotage, the workers, students, and other working people of Nanjing spontaneously organized people's armed forces such as picket teams to bravely resist the enemy's sabotage, protect factories, schools, institutions, warehouses, and confiscate the arms of defeated enemy soldiers. Most of the police and employees in the original puppet government, except for a few counter-revolutionaries who fled in fear of punishment, stayed at their posts, kept custody of materials and archives, and awaited takeover. The organization of the people's armed forces was based on worker picket teams. Workers from factories such as the clothing factory, the Puzhen plant of the Jinpu Railway, the electric light factory, and the waterworks all carried out factory protection struggles. The workers of the clothing factory not only protected the equipment and materials of their factory from any loss, but also bravely repelled the Kuomintang bandits and secret agents who were sabotaging a warehouse near the factory, allowing the grain in the warehouse to be preserved. The workers of the Puzhen plant of the Jinpu Railway quickly removed the explosives that the enemy had placed on the machines before fleeing in preparation for detonation, and secretly locked several machines in other houses and welded them shut to prevent them from being opened, ensuring the rapid resumption of work after liberation. Because the enemy cut off the supply of coal to the electric light factory before fleeing, the employees took out their own salaries to purchase coal, so that electricity could be supplied as usual after liberation. Workers in many factories worked day and night to extinguish the fires caused by arson and explosions by Kuomintang secret agents and bandits, and to rescue materials. One worker did not sleep for three days and nights. Students from various schools, such as Central University and the Central Research Institute, organized themselves, most of them armed with wooden sticks, and some students even picked up weapons discarded by the enemy to defend their schools. Most of the employees of the puppet government did not leave. The employees of the puppet Executive Yuan even concentrated all the materials in two large auditoriums, guarded them, and prevented sabotage. The former Kuomintang Central Broadcasting Station, on the second day after the People's Liberation Army entered the city, that is, on the 24th, was ordered to rebroadcast programs from the Beiping Xinhua Broadcasting Station. Many policemen were unwilling to follow the bandit gangs and flee, so they buried their guns and waited for the arrival of the People's Liberation Army, and are now performing their duties under the command of the Military Control Commission. The Fire Brigade has resumed its work and is conducting fire prevention.
