【Chahar News】The Jingxing Xinhua Motor Repair Factory has invented a new method of copper wire welding, which has greatly contributed to the use of old copper wire in the manufacture of motors. The general method of copper wire welding involves using silver solder as a flux and passing electricity through the copper wire until the joint is red-hot, allowing the silver solder to pass through the joint and solder it. However, the welding method invented by the factory only uses borax powder and glass powder (preferably potassium glass) to protect the joint. When electricity is passed through until the joint melts, slight pressure is applied to one end to complete the weld. This welding method has the following advantages over silver solder welding: (1) The silver solder weld is very hard, so the welded copper wire cannot be drawn into fine wire again. (2) Silver solder can only weld fine wires; it is very inconvenient to weld thicker wires. (3) Silver solder is very expensive, and we cannot currently produce it ourselves. In addition, in order to support military industrial production, the factory has manufactured a large number of spot welding machines for welding tail fins onto the tail tubes of shells. This welding method is about seven or eight times faster than the previous riveting method. This type of spot welding machine can also be used to weld steel plates. (Zhuang Xin)

  　发明铜线熔接新法
    【察哈尔讯】井陉新华电机修理厂发明了一种铜线熔接新法，对利用旧铜线制造电机起了很大作用。按一般铜线焊接是用银腊做焊剂、在铜线内通电至接点红热时，使银腊经过接点而焊上。但该厂所发明之熔接法，仅用硼砂粉及玻璃粉（最好是钾玻璃）保护接点，通电至接点溶化时，在一端稍加压力即成。这种熔接法比起银腊焊接法来有如下优点：（一）银腊焊接之处很硬，因此，焊过的铜线不能再拔成细线。（二）银腊只能焊接细线，焊太粗的线很不方便。（三）银腊价格很贵，且目前我们自己还不能做。又，该厂为配合军工生产，制造大批点焊机，以供熔焊炮弹尾管上的尾冀，这种焊法比从前用铆钉铆的方法要快约七、八倍。且此种点焊机亦可用以焊接钢板。    （庄心）
