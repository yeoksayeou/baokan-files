Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, April 29th: According to various sources, with the People's Liberation Army advancing victoriously, the Kuomintang bandit gang's rule in Shanghai and Hangzhou is already tottering, and both cities have fallen into a state of complete chaos. The puppet Jinghu-Hangzhou Garrison Command brazenly rejected the Shanghai citizens' request to peacefully resolve the Shanghai issue in the manner of Beiping, and announced its determination to fight to the end, placing this largest city in China under the ravages of war. Bandit chieftain Chiang Kai-shek once again flew to Shanghai on the 27th to discuss so-called "defending Shanghai" with the puppet military and government authorities in Shanghai. The bandit army also destroyed the Suzhou-Shanghai section of the Jinghu Railway in an attempt to prevent the PLA from advancing. Chen Liang, the puppet acting mayor of Shanghai, and others have repeatedly made statements, boasting that "there are comprehensive arrangements to defend Shanghai," that "there is indeed confidence," and that "everything is not a problem." However, the Shanghai citizens both hate the Kuomintang bandit gang's heinous rule and do not believe that they can continue to occupy the city. News of the PLA's imminent arrival is constantly circulating in the city. The puppet garrison headquarters has blockaded news of the war's progress and formulated a killing order: "No speech that affects public order and social order is allowed," and violators will be executed. After the mass arrests on the afternoon of the 25th and the morning of the 26th, all schools have in effect suspended classes, but the bandit authorities again ordered fifteen universities and colleges to completely evacuate Shanghai before April 30th and refused to allow the schools' professors to meet with the arrested students. The market is sluggish, the flow of goods has stopped, the puppet Central Bank's notes are no longer acceptable, and the puppet gold yuan and US dollars are depreciating sharply along with the collapse of the Kuomintang regime. On the evening of the 26th, the value of the puppet gold yuan had depreciated to such a low level that the price of the printing paper was much higher than the face value. Workers are refusing to accept wages paid by capitalists in US dollars or puppet gold yuan. Public utilities and docks are almost unable to continue operating. The price of goods when shops open in the morning only applies to the morning, and prices will rise by noon. Hangzhou, the capital of Zhejiang Province, southwest of Shanghai, is in no less chaos than Shanghai: Kuomintang dignitaries from Jinghu are fleeing there in droves, and large numbers of bandit army stragglers are retreating to Hangzhou, crowding Hangzhou to the point of overflowing. Wherever the stragglers go, they seize recruits, loot grain, enlist soldiers, and persecute the people. A huge commotion occurred at the Hangzhou Railway Station on the 25th.

　　人民解放军节节进击
  　沪杭风雨飘摇
  　国民党官僚纷纷逃难
    【新华社北平二十九日电】据各方消息：在人民解放军节节推进之下，国民党匪帮在上海、杭州的统治已经风雨飘摇，两市陷入全面混乱状态。伪京沪杭警备司令部悍然拒绝上海市民以北平方式和平解决上海问题的要求，宣布决心作战到底，把这一中国第一大城市置于炮火之下。匪首蒋介石二十七日又一度飞沪，与上海伪军政当局、商讨所谓“保卫上海”的办法。匪军并破坏京沪路苏州至上海段，企图阻止解放军前进。上海伪代理市长陈良等一再发表谈话，他们吹嘘：“保卫上海市有万全部署”，“确有把握”，“一切无问题”。但上海市民既痛恨国民党匪帮的万恶统治，也不相信他们还能继续盘踞下去。市内不时流传着解放军快到的消息。伪警备部封锁战事发展的新闻，并制定杀条：“不得有影响治安及社会秩序之言论”，违者处死。在二十五日午夜和二十六日早晨的大逮捕以后，实际上各学校都已停课，但匪方又于二十七日限令十五所大学与专科学校在四月三十日以前完全撤离上海，并拒绝各校教授会见被捕学生。市场萧条，商品流转停止，伪中央银行本票已无人愿意吸受，伪金圆券和美钞都随着国民党政权崩溃而急剧贬值。二十六日黄昏，伪金圆券的价值已贬至如此之低，以至印钞纸的价钱要比票面价高出许多倍。工人拒绝资方以美钞或伪金圆券支付工资。公用事业与码头几已不能继续维持。商店每天早晨开门时的价格只适用于早晨，到中午就要涨价。上海西南的浙江省会杭州，其混乱情形也不下于上海：京沪国民党达官贵人纷纷向那里逃难，匪军溃兵大批退到杭州，把杭州挤得水泄不通。溃兵所到之处，抓丁、抢粮、拉军、迫害人民。二十五日杭州火车站曾发生巨大骚动。
