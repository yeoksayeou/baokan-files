　　Youth Worker Zhu Limin
  　One of the Interviews with Delegates to the National Youth League Congress

    Model worker Zhu Limin is a very sturdy young man, only twenty-two years old this year. His father was a gold mine worker in Harbin, and he toiled his whole life under the cruel oppression of the Japanese puppet regime, eventually working himself to death in the mine. At the age of sixteen, Zhu Limin shouldered a small suitcase and went to work as an apprentice in a private auto repair shop in Harbin.

    In 1946, the Democratic Allied Forces liberated Northeast China. Soon after, he transferred to the large repair department of the Harbin Public Auto Factory. With the help of working comrades, he quickly raised his awareness and recognized the power of the workers themselves. Therefore, in October 1947, when the factory sent him to the workers' school to study, he studied revolutionary theory very seriously, and it was at this time that he joined the Youth League. Three months later, he was transferred back to the factory to work and lead the work of building the League.

    In the labor model movement in Harbin, he demonstrated the vanguard role of the Youth League, leading everyone into the production competition movement with his own exemplary actions. For example, a large machine on a locomotive that needed ten days to repair, he and a young worker named Li Zhimin repaired it in only seven days. In February, the League called for increased production, and Zhu Limin took the lead in leading the large repair department to respond, completing the League's call by extending work by two hours. Other departments also responded one after another, and their action resolutions were passed at the factory affairs meeting. On May 1st Labor Day, they assembled a large number of machines onto cars. At this time, Comrade Zhu Limin was elected as a second-class labor hero in Harbin.

    Soon, Zhu Limin became the director of the large repair department, but he immediately encountered a difficulty. Repairing large machines required "cylinder boring," but there were very few workers with this specialized skill. Only Guo Wenzhong in the entire factory knew how to do it. However, he was very conservative about his skills and unwilling to teach them to others. But Zhu Limin had a solution. He tried to approach Guo Wenzhong, constantly paying attention to his work and helping him improve his understanding. After work in the evenings, Zhu Limin even ran to the factory alone to study hard, repeatedly experimenting with how to use the boring machine. At first, he could not figure out what the unit of calculation on the meter was, and several experiments were unsuccessful. But this did not discourage him. After three months of continuous hard work, he finally learned everything. In October, after the worker surnamed Guo took leave to go home, Zhu Limin took over the work, so that the factory was not affected by the absence of vehicles. At the same time, he quickly taught this skill to others. Later, the worker surnamed Guo was no longer as conservative as before.

    Zhu Limin also used his spare time in the factory to organize all the young workers to help them learn technical skills, and he established a technical study class. In more than two months, even more than forty young ticket sellers learned to drive and do simple repairs. Everyone also experimented with completing the entire repair of a broken car. In a work of transporting wood piles (because their cars all burned charcoal), Comrade Zhu Limin again took the lead. He quickly mobilized more than fifty workers, and in three hours, they moved 120,000 catties of wood piles that were transported to the Songhua River near the factory, without leaving a single one behind. In addition, he also organized everyone to study culturally, established a small library, and mobilized everyone to donate more than 300 books. Therefore, they were able to cooperate with the work of the Harbin Trade Union.

    He got along very well with all the workers in the factory, and the workers were willing to tell him about their difficulties. Therefore, in the merit-making campaign in November 1948, he received one major merit and two minor merits. At the First Congress of the China New Democratic Youth League held in Harbin in March of this year, he was elected as a special model member, and this time he was elected as a representative of the Northeast Delegation to attend the National Youth League Congress.

　　青年工人朱立民
  　青年团全代大会代表访问之一
    柏生
    模范工人朱立民，是一个很结实的小伙子，今年才二十二岁。父亲是哈尔滨地方一个金矿工人，在日伪残酷的压榨下，辛苦了一生，最后竟劳死在矿山上。十六岁的朱立民便独自肩着一个小行李，走进了哈市一家私营汽车修理厂做学徒。
    一九四六年，民主联军解放了东北，不久他转到哈市公营汽车厂大修理部做工，经工作同志的帮助，他很快地提高了觉悟，认识了工人自己的力量，所以一九四七年十月，厂方调他到工人学校学习时，他是非常认真地学习着革命的理论，又在这时参加了青年团。三个月以后，他又调回厂中，一方面做工，一方面领导建团工作。
    在哈市的劳模运动中，他表现了青年团的先锋作用，用自己的模范行动带领大家卷入到生产竞赛运动中。譬如，需要十天修理完的一台车头上的大机器，他和一个小工人李治民两个人，只用七天时间就修好了。二月，团号召提高生产，朱立民首先带领大修理部响应了，以延长两小时的工作来完成团的号召。其它各部门也就接二连三的响应，在厂务大会上通过了他们的行动决议。“五一”劳动节，他们作了大量的机器装车，这时朱立民同志被选为哈市二等劳动英雄。
    不久，朱立民便当了大修理部的主任，可是马上遇到了一个困难，修理大机器时需要“旋缸子”，但会这种专门技术的工人很少，全厂只郭文忠一个工人才会。但他对技术很保守，他不愿意把这门技术教会别人。可是朱立民有办法，他设法接近了郭文忠，经常注意他的工作，帮助他提高认识，晚上下了班，朱立民更一个人跑到厂房里苦苦的研究，一次次地试验着旋缸子用的表到底怎样使用。最初他总也捉摸不懂这表的计算单位究竟是什么，几次的试验都没有成功。但这并不使他灰心，经过三个月连续不断的努力研究，终于被他全部学会了。十月里，姓郭的工人告假回家后，朱立民便代替了这个工作，使厂中没有受到出车的影响。同时，他更很快的把这个技术教给旁人。后来，那个姓郭的工人也就不再象以前那么保守了。
    朱立民在厂中还利用业余时间，组织了所有的青工，帮助他们在技术上的学习，成立技术学习班，两个多月中，连四十多个售票的青工都学会了开车和简单的修理技术，大家并试验着完成了一架破汽车的全部修理工作。在一次运木＠子（木柴）的工作中（因为他们的汽车都是烧木炭的），朱立民同志又起了带头的作用，他迅速的动员了五十多个工人，在三小时内，把运到松花江边离厂不远的十二万斤的木＠，一根也不落的搬到厂里去。另外，他还组织了大家在文化上的学习，成立了一个小型图书馆，动员大家捐献了三百多本书。因此，他们能够配合了哈市的工会工作。
    在厂中他和所有的工人都搞的非常好，工人们有什么困难都愿意告诉他。因此，在一九四八年十一月的立功运动中，他获得了一大功两小功。在今年三月哈市召开的中国新民主主义青年团第一届代表大会中，他被选为特等模范团员，这次又被选为出席青年团全代大会东北代表团的代表。
