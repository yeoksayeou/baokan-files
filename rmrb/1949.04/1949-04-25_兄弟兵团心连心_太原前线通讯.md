Brotherly Armies, Hearts Linked: Frontline Dispatch from Taiyuan
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Xu Kong

　　On March 30th, the troops were advancing towards Taiyuan along the highway. – That night, we heard that tomorrow, a brotherly unit from a certain army group would welcome us in Daming Town, and possibly even a certain field army! The soldiers were so excited they couldn't sleep well, saying, "This is a meeting of 'siblings'! The old brothers from North China are all gathering together!" At that time, many people took out paper and wrote letters of greeting under the lamp.

　　The instructor said, "The south is Daming Town. It's our first time meeting our elder brothers, so we must be presentable." Everyone was busy tidying up their clothes and hats when suddenly they saw dust flying on the highway to the south. A chestnut horse came galloping, with a person riding it, a small red flag stuck on the muzzle of the gun, and a large red flower tied to the flagpole. Many of our cadres immediately went to greet them. It turned out to be a liaison officer specially sent by the welcoming team of a certain army group. A comrade learned from him that the elder brothers of a certain army group had traveled more than 200 li from Yuci to be here. They had been without sleep for two or three nights to welcome us.

　　As we approached Daming Town, we could see tall, colorful arches with two bright red flags waving in the distance. Then, the sound of salutes echoed into the sky, and the bugles blared. Inside the arches were the military band of a certain field army and the local people's wind and string instrument team, followed by rows of welcoming crowds, troops, and rear hospitals. The streets were packed with people, stretching as far as the eye could see. Red and green flags fluttered everywhere, and people shouted at the top of their lungs, "Welcome our elder brothers!" "Brotherly armies unite to take Taiyuan and save the people!" Cheers, slogans, and military music resounded together! Many wounded and sick comrades left their ranks and ran alongside the main force on crutches. A local villager delivering public grain left his cart by the wall and ran into the crowd to shout slogans.

　　Walking into the second archway was a completely different world: many tables were set with tea, peanuts, and red dates, and there were storytellers and peep shows…, decorated into various propaganda and mobilization booths. As soon as the troops appeared, many comrades came running up with gifts, stuffing things into our hands while singing clappers: "Elder brothers, you've arrived, you've worked hard on the march, have a cigarette to relieve your fatigue!" "My peanuts are big and round, elder brother, eat them and fight for Taiyuan!"

　　A small comrade ran out with two bowls of boiled water and said, "Elder brothers! They have peanuts and red dates, I brought boiled water to comfort you! I boiled this plain water myself, elder brother, drink it and make meritorious service!"

　　The comrades in our ranks also shouted slogans excitedly, "Resolutely take Taiyuan!" "Thank you, elder brothers, for welcoming us!" "Learn from the elder brothers' spirit of unity and friendship!" At this moment, the loudspeakers in the air also played a happy song:

　　A burst of drums, a burst of bugles, brotherly armies meet.
　　People cheer, horses neigh, the Taiyuan front is lively!

　　The representative of the welcoming team arrived, ran up, and shook hands warmly with our leaders at the front. They said, "You have had a hard time on this journey! We have been looking forward to you for several months! You have finally arrived today!" We said, "You have worked hard too. We have already seen your heroic deeds in attacking the East Mountains and Niutuozhai in the newspapers!" Everyone's faces were flushed, happy from the bottom of their hearts.

　　Passing through the third archway, a group of small comrades in black pants, white shirts, and red stars on their chests came out with music, especially to present flowers to the leaders and heroes. Each of them held a large red flower, dancing and singing: "This big red flower, let the leaders and heroes wear it! This is a welcome flower, this is a unity flower, this is a forward flower! This is a victory flower! ..."

　　Colored paper fluttered in the sky, and the leaders and heroes all smiled and returned the salute to the small comrades.

　　In the singing of the loudspeakers and the enthusiastic applause of the brotherly troops, the troops walked out of this three-li long welcome station.

　　At the campsite, after the lights-out bugle call, everyone kept singing the song broadcast by the loudspeaker: "Brotherly armies meet, we are confident in capturing Taiyuan! Brotherly armies, hearts linked, advance forward to take Taiyuan!"

　　兄弟兵团心连心——太原前线通讯
    徐孔
    三月三十日，部队沿着公路向太原挺进着。——那天夜里就听说：明天有某兵团的兄弟部队在大盂镇欢迎我们，还可能有某野战军哩！战士们喜欢的觉也未睡好，纷纷的说：“这可是‘手足’相会呀！华北老弟兄们，全凑到一块了！”当时就有许多人，拿出纸来在灯下写慰问信。
    教导员说：“南边就是大盂镇，第一回和老大哥见面，总要整齐点呀。”大家正忙着整理衣帽，忽然看见南边公路上尘土飞扬，一匹枣红马四蹄翻飞的跑来，马上骑着一个人，枪口上插着一面小红旗，旗杆上还糸着一朵大红花，我们许多干部马上迎上去，原来是某兵团欢迎队专派来联络的。一个同志由他那儿知道：某兵团的老大哥们，从榆次二百多里赶到这里，为了欢迎我们，已经两三夜没有睡觉了。
    走近大盂镇，老远就看见高大的彩牌楼上飘着两面鲜红的大旗，紧接着“噔噔”的礼炮声冲天而起，军号也“的的嗒嗒”地响起来。进了牌楼，前边是某野战军的军乐队和老乡们的笙管队，再往里是群众、部队和后方医院的欢迎行列。街道两旁人山人海，望不见边，红绿小旗满天乱飞，人们张大喉咙喊着：“欢迎我们的老大哥！”“兄弟兵团大会合，打下太原救人民！”欢呼、口号、军乐响成一片！许多伤病员同志离开自己的行列，架着拐杖跟大部队旁边跑。一个送公粮的老乡，把大车丢在墙根，也跑进人群跟着喊起口号来。
    走进第二道牌楼，完全是另一个天地：很多桌子放着茶水、花生、红枣，还有唱大鼓的、拉洋片的……，布置成各色各样的宣传鼓动棚。队伍一露面，就有许多同志拿着慰劳品跑上来，一边给往手里塞东西，一边唱着快板：“老大哥，都来到，一路行军辛苦了，抽枝纸烟解疲劳！”“我的花生大又圆，大哥你吃了打太原！”
    一个小同志端着两碗开水跑出来说：“老大哥！他们是花生大红枣，我拿工水来慰劳！白开水我自个烧，大哥喝了立功劳！”
    我们队伍里的同志也激动的喊起口号来：“坚决打下太原城！”“感谢老大哥对我们的欢迎！”“学习老大哥团结友爱的精神！”这时空中的扩音器也唱起快乐的歌子：
    一阵鼓来一阵号，兄弟兵团会师了。
    人欢笑，马欢叫，太原前线好热闹！
    欢迎队的代表来了，跑上来和我们前边的首长热烈地握手，他们说：“你们这一道上太辛苦了！盼望他们好几个月呀！今天真来了！”我们说：“还是你们辛苦，打东山和牛驼寨的英勇事迹，我们早在报纸上看到了！”大家脸上都红通通的，从心里欢喜面上。
    穿过第三道牌楼，伴着音乐出来一群黑裤、白衫胸前镶着红星的小同志，特来给首长和功臣们献花。他们每人手里拿着一朵大红花，一边舞、一边唱：“这朵大红花，首长功臣们戴上它！这是欢迎花，这是团结花，这是前进花！这是胜利花！……”
    五彩纸片随着飞散天空，首长、功臣全都含笑向小同志们还礼。
    在扩音器的歌声中，在兄弟部队热烈的掌声中，部队走出了这三里长的欢迎站。
    到宿营地，吹熄灯号了，大家还不住唱着扩音器播出的歌：“兄弟兵团大会合，攻取太原有把把握！兄弟兵团心连心，打下太原向前进！”
