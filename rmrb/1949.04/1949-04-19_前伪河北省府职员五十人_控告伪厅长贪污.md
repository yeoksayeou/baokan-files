To the Editorial Department: We are a group of small staff members from the former pseudo-Hebei Provincial Government's Finance Department. We have a problem to bring up and request that your newspaper publish it. Because the salaries of employees in the former pseudo-Hebei Provincial Government were meager, each department established employee cooperatives to supplement their income in case of emergencies. Our Finance Department's cooperative was reorganized last spring, and directors, supervisors, and a manager were elected at that time. Before the Dragon Boat Festival last year, 150 bags of flour were purchased from the Fuxing Flour Mill at a price of over 2 million pseudo-legal tender per bag. At that time, due to insufficient capital, the cooperative borrowed over 300 million (pseudo-legal tender) from the department in the name of the cooperative, stating that any losses would be shared by everyone, and any profits would be distributed to everyone. These bags of flour were not distributed by the end of the year, nor after liberation. We went to ask the manager, and he said that the director had handled the batch of flour. Later, when the director found out about this, he said to people, "It is true that the flour was handled by me, surnamed Wang, and whoever dares to ask me about it, I will deal with him!" Because he spoke so fiercely, we did not dare to directly confront him. Helplessly, we can only raise the following points and ask your newspaper to answer them.
    
    1. This flour was purchased from Fuxing, and there are accounts to check, and there are also accounts in the department as proof. The cooperative belongs to everyone. Is it considered embezzlement for the director to swallow it himself? Should we demand its return?
    
    2. If he continues to use oppression and intimidation against us, where should we go to seek justice? This is the truth, without any falsehood. We hope that the full text will be published so that the general public can understand that the remnants of the Kuomintang still exist and are still secretly exerting their power.

### 前伪河北省府职员五十人　控告伪厅长贪污

　　前伪河北省府职员五十人
  　控告伪厅长贪污
    编辑部公鉴：我们是前伪河北省政府财政厅的一群小职员，有一个问题提出来请贵报予以公布。前伪河北省政府因职员待遇微薄，各厅处都成立了员工合作社，以求补助于万一；我们财政厅的合作社在去春重新组织成立，当时曾选了董事监事及经理等。去岁五月节前曾由福兴面粉厂买了一百五十袋面，每袋价洋伪法币二百多万元。当时因股本不足，曾以合作社名义由厅里借了三亿多元（伪法币），并言明赔了大家摊，赚了大家分；这些面到年底没分，解放后也没分。我们曾去问经理，他说这批面由厅长处理了。后来厅长知道了这消息，就对人说：“面是我姓王的处理了，不错，谁敢要我就对付他！”因他说的这么利害，我们不敢直接找他。无奈，只得提出下列几点请贵报见答。
    一、此面系由福兴所买，有帐可查，厅内也有帐可凭。合作社是大家的，由厅长自己吞没是否算贪污？我们应否追还？
    二、他如仍用压迫及恐吓手段对我们，我们应向哪里去申冤？此系实言，毫无虚假，望将全文公布，以便使一般人明白国民党的余孽仍存在，仍在暗施淫威。
