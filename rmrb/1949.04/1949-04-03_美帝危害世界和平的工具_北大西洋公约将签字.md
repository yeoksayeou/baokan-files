Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, 1st -- According to various sources: The North Atlantic Treaty, which endangers world peace, will be signed on April 4th. The foreign ministers of Britain, Italy, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Luxembourg have successively arrived in Washington. The governments of Denmark, Iceland, and Portugal have accepted "invitations" and expressed their willingness to participate to the US government. Prominent Spanish fascists are also discussing participation. The fact that the North Atlantic Treaty is a combination of fascist aggressive blocs is becoming increasingly clear, not only from the content of the treaty itself, but also from the members who have already joined and are about to join.

　　As the treaty is about to be signed, Washington is actively preparing a so-called "military aid plan." U.S. imperialism is preparing to equip the troops of these countries with 1 to 1.5 billion in military materials, making them pawns of American aggressors in Europe. Truman has appointed Beckner as a special assistant to the Secretary of State to specifically strategize on this matter.

　　Furthermore, according to Agence France-Presse, the U.S. government is seeking to take advantage of the foreign ministers being in the United States to discuss the following issues, including: ① the German question, namely, restoring German military industries and supporting the revival of German aggressive forces; ② suppressing the Vietnamese people's democratic revolution; ③ the Middle East military base issue; ④ establishing military bases in Canada and jointly occupying Newfoundland with Canada; ⑤ establishing so-called "Northern Defenses" in Norway, Denmark, and Iceland and wooing Sweden to join the Atlantic Treaty; ⑥ rapidly resolving the Indonesian issue. The above items contain one basic element, which is to further expand the scope of American aggression and establish world military bases, etc., attempting to form an encirclement against the Soviet Union and the New Democratic countries, and preparing to launch a new imperialist war.

　　美帝危害世界和平的工具
  　北大西洋公约将签字
    【新华社北平一日电】据各方消息：危害世界和平的北大西洋公约将于四月四日签字。英、意、荷、比、卢诸国外长，已陆续抵达华盛顿。丹麦、冰岛、葡萄牙三国政府，已接受“邀请”向美国政府表示愿意参加。西班牙著名法西斯分子亦正商讨参加。北大西洋公约是法西斯侵略集团的结合，这个事实，不但从公约的内容来看，而且就从其已经参加和行将参加的会员方面来看，也正在一天比一天明显。
    在该约即将签字时，华盛顿方面正在积极地准备所谓“军事援助计划”。美帝准备以十亿至十五亿的军事物资，装备这些国家的部队，成为美国侵略者在欧洲的走卒。杜鲁门已委任贝克纳为国务卿的特别助理，专门策略此事。
    又据法新社消息，美国政府寻乘各国外长在美的时机，商讨下列问题，包括：①德国问题，即恢复德国军事工业，扶植德国侵略势力复活。②镇压越南人民民主革命。③中东军事基地问题。④在加拿大建立军事基地并与加拿大联合占领纽芬兰。⑤在挪威、丹麦、冰岛建立所谓“北方防御”及拉拢瑞典参加大西洋公约。⑥迅速解决印尼问题。上述项目包含一个基本内容，就是进一步扩张美国的侵略范围，建立世界军事基地等，企图对苏联和新民主主义国家形成包围圈，准备发动新的帝国主义战争。
