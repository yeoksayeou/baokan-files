　　Yushe Third District Adopts Various Methods
  　Guaranteeing Adequate Fertilizer for Military Families
    [Taihang Electric] In order to ensure that the production of families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers yields the same harvest as the masses, Yushi and other places have timely and specifically discussed and arranged preferential treatment for military families through substitute farming. The Yushi Third District specifically convened a village cadre meeting, which decided that if families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers lack manure and fertilizer, and are unable to let livestock lie on the ground or trample manure, the manure from village schools, village offices, and cooperatives can be used. If this is still insufficient, assistance can be provided for ground composting. In short, the land of families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers must maintain a considerable amount of fertilizer. Zhenjing Village in Licheng has consistently done a good job in substitute farming. This year, with the voluntary participation of the families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers and after discussions within mutual aid teams, substitute farming was fixed to each team, and the supply of firewood and water was assigned to specific individuals. Everyone proposed to ensure timely cultivation, with each mu of land to be harrowed once, hoed twice, and weeded three times, with 35 @ of fertilizer applied, to truly achieve an increase of 20 jin of fine grains per person.

　　榆社三区采用各种办法
  　保证军属肥料够用
    【太行电】为使烈军干属生产和群众一样收获，榆社等地及时具体讨论与布置了优军代耕工作。榆社三区专门召开的村干会议上，决定：烈军属没有粪土，又无力卧地与羊踩粪的，可将各村学校、村公所、合作社的粪用上，如仍不足，可帮助卧地，总之要使烈军土属地保持相当数量的肥料。黎城畛井村代耕工作一贯做得很好。今年在烈军属的自愿下，经互助组讨论，把代耕固定到各组，柴水供给固定给专人。大家提出保证做到耕作按时，每亩地要耙一犁二锄三，上肥三十五＠，确实做到每人增产细粮二十斤。
