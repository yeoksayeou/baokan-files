Tianjin Municipal Organs
    Conserve Electricity

[Tianjin Dispatch] Following the Tianjin Municipal CCP Committee's advocacy for conserving electricity, it has garnered attention from all sectors here. Various organs are successively formulating electricity-saving measures. The Municipal Public Security Bureau, to strengthen street light management and conserve electricity, has specially installed circuit breakers in each police station, to be switched on and off by the garrison personnel on time. The CCP's Eleventh District Committee convened an enlarged cadre meeting for this purpose, reviewing serious wasteful phenomena in the past such as lights being left on day and night, and electric stoves constantly being in use. The Organization Department of the District Committee took the lead in stopping the use of electric stoves, reducing six lights to four. The Changlu Salt Administration Bureau also minimized unnecessary lights in the bureau as much as possible, reducing electricity meters from fourteen to two, and telephones from eleven to five. It also established rules such as turning off lights on time and not leaving lights on when the room is empty. The Tianjin Railway Bureau's Telecommunications Section also notified its subordinate units to conserve electricity. The Tanggu Power Engineering Section alone saved more than 900 kilowatt-hours of electricity in the first half of April, and is still adjusting light bulbs, expecting to save more than 1,000 kilowatt-hours in the second half of the month.

　　津市各机关
    节省用电
    【天津电】津市中共市委机关提倡节省电力后，已引起此间各界注意，各机关陆续制定各项节电办法。市公安局为加强路灯管理，节省电流，特将电闸分装于各派出所内，由警备班人员按时开闭。中共第十一区区委会曾为此召开扩大干部会议，检讨过去昼夜不熄灯，电炉经常烧着等严重的浪费现象。区委会组织部首先停烧电炉，将六灯减为四个。长芦盐务管理局亦将该局不必要的灯火尽量减少，电表由十四个减至两个，电话机由十一个减至五个。并树立按时熄灯及室内无人不开灯等制度。天津铁路局电务段也通知所属各单位节省电力，仅塘沽电力工区在四月上半月就省出电力九百多度，现仍调整灯头，预计下半月可省千度以上。
