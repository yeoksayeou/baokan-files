Faced with the powerful political offensive of our army, the escape of soldiers from the Yan Faction's "Steadfast Division" 1st Regiment, entrenched in the Haojiagou area outside the east gate of Taiyuan, could no longer be blocked. From the first to the fifth day of the Lunar New Year, a total of twenty-three people fled from the 1st and 4th companies. To the headache of the bandit leaders, two squad leaders even led their entire squads to defect to the People's Liberation Army.

On February 5th, the bandit regiment commander Shi Ruitian issued an order to move the 1st and 4th companies to the rear, and to let the 2nd platoon of the mortar company, which had not experienced any desertions, guard the front line. When the 2nd platoon leader Wang Ziyi received the order, he constantly pondered in his mind: "Keep a close watch after going to the front line! If the soldiers want to run, even the God of Heaven can't stop them; if you relax a little! Li Yurong, the platoon leader of the 1st platoon of the 3rd company of the 2nd regiment, was shot for his soldiers carrying away a machine gun. Rather than learning from Li Yurong, it would be better to take this platoon of people and defect to the People's Liberation Army." So, on the night of their first day on the front line, the 2nd platoon of the mortar company surrendered to the People's Liberation Army. This incident made Shi Ruitian's eyes widen in anger. From the 6th, he had no choice but to send the trusted special service platoon of the regimental headquarters to the front line.

The special service platoon went to the front line every evening at dusk to replace the 3rd company, and the 3rd company replaced them the next morning. But every night they heard the People's Liberation Army tell them about the national war situation and the liberation of Tianjin and Beijing, that Taiyuan City would definitely be liberated by the People's Liberation Army, etc., and repeatedly advised them: "Do less evil and leave a way out for yourselves." In fact, after the special service platoon arrived at the front, the 1st, 3rd, and 4th companies were still running away in entire squads and platoons. Moreover, when the 1st platoon of the 1st company rushed past the front line to defect to the People's Liberation Army, they impolitely captured the two sentries in front. Faced with this series of events, Zhang Jingyun, the lieutenant platoon leader of the special service platoon, also wavered. He knew: as long as he surrendered, he could go home, and there was a way to bring his wife along from Taiyuan. However, what if his wife couldn't walk when going home? Therefore, on the night of the 10th, he sent his confidant squad leader Li Guifu to contact the People's Liberation Army, and he himself deployed his troops, waiting for a reply. Coincidentally, on the night of the 11th, two soldiers from the special service platoon also ran away. Shi Ruitian knew about it and repeatedly cried out in distress: "The special service platoon can also run away!? How can this team still work!?" In fact, the special service platoon had been preparing to "leave" these past two days. The platoon leader's wife and the soldier Wu Xi's son had both come to Haojiagou from Taiyuan; seven "new soldiers" had suddenly been added to the special service platoon, all of whom were Zhang Jingyun's trusted assistants, and a large hole had been blown in the barbed wire in front of the position by their own hand grenades.

Late on the night of the 14th, the personnel who spread rumors and deceived people, and the law enforcement officers were all asleep. Li Guifu's accent came from the People's Liberation Army's position: "Come over! Don't worry about your families not being able to walk. Last time, Mr. × Platoon Leader's wife came, and it was the battalion commander's horse (referring to the People's Liberation Army) that took her to the rear." Zhang Jingyun casually replied, "Let's talk about it tomorrow!" Here, Li Guifu and Section Chief Hou of the Political Department of the People's Liberation Army Division smiled knowingly and went back to prepare everything to welcome Zhang Jingyun tomorrow.

On the evening of the 15th, the special service platoon that went to the front line was very different from usual: machine gun squad leader Song Mingshan carried two machine guns, Han Fusheng and Hu Jinrong each had a rifle, a submachine gun, and a pistol - three weapons; in addition to carrying his own pistol, Zhang Jingyun also hung the pistol of the 3rd battalion commander on his waist, and the platoon leader's "wife" was also disguised as a soldier. After everything was ready, they were just waiting to "set off" when they reached the front line. Unexpectedly, when Han Fusheng led the platoon leader's wife towards the position, they ran into the deputy assistant battalion commander of the 2nd battalion who was returning from inspecting the position. Han Fusheng quickly told the platoon leader's wife to get into a bomb shelter, and he spoke with the deputy battalion commander. Who knew that the deputy battalion commander turned around and walked to the position with them. It was only when Zhang Jingyun came over that he led the platoon leader's wife to avoid the deputy battalion commander's sight and detour to the front.

At that time, the deputy assistant battalion commander had become suspicious of them. He muttered a few words to the 3rd company instructor who came up to shout slogans, and soon two law enforcement officers and an instructor came and stood dozens of steps away to their left. Han Fusheng and Hu Jinrong, these two veteran soldiers of many years, also saw the general trend of events. One of them approached his platoon leader and the deputy assistant battalion commander, and the other walked a few steps forward to watch the 3rd company instructor who was reciting the Yan faction's "slogan materials." Although the telephone line leading to the regimental headquarters had been cut by them, they were always mindful of the surrounding changes. It was getting dark, and the deputy assistant battalion commander standing between Zhang Jingyun and Han Fusheng was pulling the bolt of his pistol. Zhang Jingyun knew that he would definitely suffer if he acted later. Without delay, he said to the deputy battalion commander: "Look, what are those five or six people doing over there?" As he said this, he pointed in a direction. The deputy battalion commander had just turned his head when Zhang Jingyun shot him in the head, and Han Fusheng casually stuffed the deputy battalion commander into the bomb shelter.

"Who's shooting!? Who's shooting!?" The 3rd company instructor who was shouting slogans asked as he walked to the rear.

"What are you doing!? Go back and shout your slogans!" Hu Jinrong's submachine gun was already aimed at the instructor's chest. When the instructor was forced to turn around and walk forward again, the submachine gun spat out five bullets, and the instructor lay motionless in the trench.

"Who's shooting!? Who's shooting!?" The last instructor and two law enforcement officers rushed towards them together. Perhaps these three ghosts thought that the gunfire was the deputy battalion commander shooting Zhang Jingyun, and that their "major event" had "succeeded." Unexpectedly, at this time the machine guns and submachine guns of the special service platoon swept towards those special agents, shouting "The Eighth Route Army is here!" The artillery fire on the People's Liberation Army's position was also supporting them. Shells burst one by one on the enemy's second line of defense. The enemy on the second line of defense was in a panic, preparing to "parry" the "Eighth Route Army" that had come, while here the People's Liberation Army's position had received sixteen surrendered soldiers loaded with weapons.

　　“堵挡不住的逃风”
  　阎匪“坚贞师”一团的官兵投诚缩影
    张春旬
    在我军强大的政治攻势面前，困守太原东门外郝家沟一带的阎匪“坚贞师”一团士兵的逃跑，已无法堵挡了。从大年初一到初五，一连和四连就跑了二十三人，使匪首们最头痛的——竟有两个班长把整班人都带上投奔了解放军。
    二月五日，匪军团长史瑞田下了一道命令，把一连、四连都调到后面，让没有发生过逃跑的迫击炮连二排去守头道线。二排长王子义接到命令，脑子里就不断的盘算：上阵地后紧紧地监视吧！当兵的要跑，天老爷也挡不住；放松一点吧！二团三连一排排长李玉荣，就是因为士兵扛走机枪被枪毙了，与其学了李玉荣，倒不如带上这排人去投奔解放军。于是，在他们第一天上阵地的夜间，迫击炮连二排就向人民解放军投诚了。这件事急得史瑞田两眼大瞪，从六号起，只好把亲信的团部特务排放到头道线上。
    特务排每天黄昏时到头道线上把三连换下来，天明后三连再把他们换下去。但他们夜夜听到人民解放军告诉他们全国战局及平津解放的经过，太原城一定被解放军解放等，并且一再劝告他们：少作点恶，给自己留后路。事实上特务排到了前边，一连、三连、四连仍是整班整排的跑，而且一连一排在冲过前沿投奔解放军时，不客气地俘虏了前边的两个哨兵。在这一连串事情面前，特务排的上尉排长张景云也动摇了，他知道：只要投诚就能回家，女人在太原也有办法带上。但是，回家时女人走不动怎么办？于是，他在十号晚上，将心腹班长李桂馥派过来和解放军联系，自己调兵遣将，静候回音。恰巧在十一日夜特务排也跑了两个兵，史瑞田知道了直气得连声叫苦：“特务排还能跑了！？这队伍还能行！？”其实，特务排这两天正作“走”的准备，排长的老婆、士兵武喜的儿子，都从太原来到郝家沟；特务排里忽然增加了七个“新兵”，他们都是张景云的亲信助手，阵地前边的铁丝网已被他们自己的手榴弹炸了大窟窿。
    十四日深夜，那些造谣欺骗的喊话人员、执法员都睡觉了，李桂馥的口音从解放军阵地上传来：“过来吧！不要顾虑眷属走不动，上次×排长的太太来了，是人家（指解放军）营长的马送到后方的”。张景云随口答了个“明天再谈吧”！这边李桂馥和解放军师政治部的侯干事会意地笑了笑，便回去准备明天迎接张景云的一切了。
    十五日黄昏，上阵地的特务排和往日大不相同：机枪班长宋明山扛了两挺机枪，韩富生和胡金荣都是一支步枪、一支冲锋枪和一只手枪三件武器；张景云除带上自己的手枪外，还把三营营长的手枪也挂在腰间，排长“太太”也化装成当兵的样子，一切准备好后，当等到了头道线上就要“动身”了。不料韩富生领着排长太太往阵地上走时，碰上了巡视阵地回来的二营助理营副，韩富生赶快叫排长的女人钻入避弹坑，自己和那个营副说话，谁知那个营副又回头和他们一同往阵地上走，还是张景云过来，才领着排长女人避开营副的视线绕到前边。
    当时那个助理营副对他们已起了疑心，他和上来喊话的三连指导员唧咕了几句，不一会又来了两个执法员和一个指导员，站在他们左边几十步远的地方。韩富生、胡金荣，这两个多年的老兵，也看出事情的大势，他们一个靠近了自己的排长和助理营副，一个往前走了几步，看住了背诵阎匪“喊话材料”的三连指导员。虽然，通往团部的电话线已被他们剪断了，但他们总是留心着周围的事变。天黑了，站在张景云、韩富生当中的助理营副在拉手枪拴，张景云见后下手必定遭殃，事不宜迟，便对营副说：“你看那边五六个人是干什么的”？说着用手指了一个方向，营副刚刚扭头，张景云就在他的头脑上给了一枪，韩富生随手把营副填进了避弹坑。
    “谁打枪！？谁打枪！？”正在喊话的三连指导员一面问，一面往后面走。
    “干什么！？回去喊你的话去”！胡金荣手中的冲锋枪已对准了指导员的胸膛，等指导员被迫回头再往前走时，冲锋枪吐出五粒子弹，指导员躺在交通壕里再也不动了。
    “谁打枪！？谁打枪！？”最后来的一个指导员两个执法员一齐向他们扑来，也许这三个送死鬼以为响枪是营副打死了张景云，是他们的“大事”“成功了”。不料这时特务排的机枪、冲锋枪都向那些特务们扫去，一面打一面喊：“八路军来了”！解放军阵地上的炮火也在策应他们，炮弹一颗颗地在敌人二道线上爆发，二道线上的敌人一时手忙脚乱，准备“招架”来了的“八路军”，而这边解放军阵地上已收到了十六个满载武器的投降兵。
