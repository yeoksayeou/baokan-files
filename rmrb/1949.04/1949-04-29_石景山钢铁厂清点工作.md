　　Inventory Work at Shijingshan Steel Plant
    Zi Chi
    The inventory work at the Shijingshan Steel Plant of the North China Steel Company, which began on February 26th, has been successfully completed after more than half a month of work. Because the inventory tightly relied on activating positive elements and mobilizing the masses to assist, a large number of omitted and concealed materials and equipment were found, the number of which was quite astonishing. In the electricity plant alone, the types of unreported materials found exceeded 100%, and the quantity exceeded 50%. The unreported materials found in the mechanical repair shop also reached 30%. As a result, the work of supplementing and creating inventory lists has not yet been fully completed.
    How to Prepare?
    Because the entire plant was too large and the materials were extremely disorganized, the inventory had to be carried out separately by ten units according to the work departments, and the preparation period was extended to two weeks. Before the inventory, it was first necessary to communicate ideas among the cadres, to recognize that it was necessary to mobilize the masses, and to have an attitude of responsibility to the people. Then, the work team provided the active elements participating in the inventory, convened a general meeting of inventory personnel, and mobilization meetings in each factory. The trade union preparatory committee also called on everyone to assist in the inventory and carried out extensive publicity and education through worker's newspapers, blackboards, and study groups, so that the workers recognized that this inventory was not for others, but for everyone, because now the factory is run by everyone.
    Experienced cadres and more than half of the worker representatives were appropriately combined in the organization, and the enthusiasm of the worker representatives was vigorously promoted. In the preparation of specific work, we first went to the nine factories to understand the actual situation, and referred to the original accounts to study the inventory lists (most of the inventory lists were copied from the cards, and the cards were lost, so most of them were unreliable), and printed the material profit and loss statements.
    Gains in the Inventory
    1. Generally, the workers' concern for the factory has been improved. The inventory shows that the workers are truly masters of the factory. The Jin Ding Jie "Oil Character" study group contributed seven suggestions for the inventory work, suggesting that special attention should be paid to private dormitory furniture during the inventory, and hoping to carefully inventory, without time limits, and report omitted materials at any time. Ma Mingsheng from the locomotive factory said: "Today's inventory personnel are not the receiving officers of the Kuomintang in the past, but our own fellow workers, which means that the factory is ours today."
    2. A large number of active departments were discovered, such as the electrical repair department of the electricity plant, the motor section of the iron smelting plant, and the transportation section of the general affairs office. The workers all worked together to sort out the tools and materials by category and waited for the inventory. At the same time, many individual positive elements were also discovered: such as the workers Ma Jiangong, Liu Baolin, Han Renqi, and Ma Jingxin from the coking plant, who picked up a string of discarded faucets and water pipes from various parts of the factory. Mi Rui and other workers from the third boiler room of the power plant picked up some tools in the tunnel ditches and handed them over to the warehouse. They said: "These were thrown there during the puppet regime and no one knew about them. Now that the factory is our own, everyone should be careful to pick up materials at any time and hand them over to the inventory comrades for production applications." Li Yuanting, a worker in the labor section, sorted out all kinds of paper in the warehouse of the affairs section one by one, which took a day and a half. Hao Junhou and Ma Yulin, workers at the crane factory, automatically got up early on Sunday, braved the strong wind and rushed to the vicinity of the new factory to check the lost machines, and found a total of more than ten cranes, eight or nine cement mixing inlays for construction, and many other crane parts in the weeds. When Xu Tianjue from the coal coking plant was sorting out materials that were not in the inventory list, because he was not familiar with the names of the materials and parts, he drew a picture of the original object on it and then recorded the quantity delivered.
    3. Many unreasonable phenomena in management were also discovered in the inventory, so some people proposed the requirement to reform the management of materials and tools.
    Several Experiences
    1. The inventory work is good where the masses are mobilized well, and the inventory work must be bad where the mobilization is not good; this once again proves the accuracy of the mass line. Such a chaotic and disorderly factory has not been cleaned up since the enemy and puppet regime. In the past, the Kuomintang receiving officers looked at these heavy ironwares without any profit, and only looked at the inventory list when they received them, and there was no unified responsible system for materials and tools. If we do not rely on active elements and mobilize the masses to assist this time, the inventory work is unimaginable.
    2. We should conduct in-depth research on the current actual situation, investigate the workers' misunderstandings about the inventory, and conduct ideological education and explanation in advance. For example, the workers in a certain department of the mechanical repair shop were unwilling when they were inventorying tools. Later, after investigation, it was learned that there was no tool management system in the past. Whoever used it took it, and everyone was not responsible. Now, if they want to register, they have to be responsible. Later, after explanation, the emotions stabilized.
    3. The inventory list should not be made too early. Making an inventory list as soon as it is received must have perfunctory behavior. We should first mobilize the masses and then rely on active elements to supervise and help make the inventory list.
    4. The heads of each department should be strictly ordered to conduct a detailed inventory, which can avoid the phenomenon that the heads of departments stand by and do not take responsibility.
    5. After the end of the inventory work, launch a "housekeeping" movement, which not only cleaned up the factory, but also found a lot of discarded materials and tools, which is an extension of the inventory movement.
    6. Many of the scrapped equipment are not completely unusable, and some of the accessories can be taken down and used.

　　石景山钢铁厂清点工作
    子炽
    华北钢铁公司石景山钢铁厂清点工作自二月二十六日起经半月余工作，已全部顺利清点完成。由于在清点中紧紧依靠积极分子发动群众协助，查出大批遗漏及匿报物资器材，为数十分惊人，单就电力厂一个部门所查出的漏报资材，其种类超出百分之百以上，数量超出百分之五十以上。机械修理厂查出的漏报物资也达百分之三十。以致补造清册工作，至今尚未完全结束。
    怎样准备？
    因为全厂规模太大，资材零乱到极点，所以清点时不得不按工作部门分十个单位分头进行，并且把准备时期延长到两个星期。清点前首先在干部中打通思想，要认识到必须发动群众，同时要有对人民负责的态度，然后再由工作团提供参加清点的积极分子，召开清点人员大会，及各厂动员大会。职工筹委会也号召大家协助清点，并通过职工小报、黑板报、学习小组等展开广泛的宣传教育，使职工们认识到这次清点不是替别人清点，而是大家的事，因为现在的工厂是大伙儿当家作主了。
    在组织中适当配合了有经验的干部，和二分之一以上的职工代表，大力发扬了职工代表的积极性。在具体工作的准备上则先下九厂了解实际情况，及参考原帐目研究清册（清册大半照卡片上抄来，卡片有遗失，故大半不可靠），印资材盈亏表。
    清点中的收获
    一、一般提高了工人对工厂的关心，清点说明了工人对工厂是真正当家作主的。金顶街油字学习小组贡献清点工作七点意见，建议清点时要特别注意私人宿舍家具，并希望认真清点，不加限期、随时报告遗漏资材。机车厂马鸣声说：“今天的清点人员并不是从前国民党的接收大员，而是我们自己的工友弟兄，这就表示工厂今天就是我们自己的啦”。
    二、发现了大批积极部门，如电力厂电气修理部，炼铁厂机动科，总务处运输科等单位，工友们都大伙动手把工具材料分门别类整理好等待清点。同时也发现了许多个别的积极分子：如炼焦厂工友马建功、刘宝霖、韩任琦、麻景新等在厂子各处拣回了一串被丢弃的水龙头、水管子。电力厂三锅炉房工友米瑞等在地道水沟内拣起好些工具来交给仓库，他们说：“这些是敌伪时代投在那里的，没人知道，现在厂子是自己的了，物料每人随时都应留神拣起交给清点同志，以备生产应用”。劳工科工友李元庭把事务科仓库各类纸张都一张张整理出来，足足整理了一天半。起重厂工友郝俊厚、马玉琳自动在礼拜天起了一个早，冒着大风赶到新工厂附近去查失散的机器，在乱草堆里一共发现了十多部起重机，八九个建筑用的水泥混合镶和其他许多起重机用件。煤焦厂许天爵在整理清册中没有的资材时，因不熟悉材料零件的名字，就按原物画个图在上面，然后记下交的数量。
    三、在清点中也发现了许多管理上的不合理现象，因此有人提出改革材料、工具管理的要求。
    几点经验
    一、发动群众好的地方清点工作好，发动得不好的地方一定清点不好；又一次证明了群众路线的准确。这样混乱的无秩序的工厂，自敌伪时到现在没有清理过，过去国民党接收大员看着这些笨重的铁器没有油水，收点时也只看了看清册，而且材料工具的无统一的负责制度，如果这回不依靠积极分子并发动群众协助，清点工作是不可想象的。
    二、应该对现在实际情形加以深刻的研究，调查职工们对清点的认识错误的看法，预先加以思想教育及解释。如机械修理厂某部清点工具时工友们都不愿意，后来调查结果，才知道过去没有工具保管制度，谁用谁拿，大家不负责任，现在要登记就要负责任。后来经过解释后，情绪才安定下来。
    三、清册不宜造得过早，一接收时即造清册一定有敷衍塞责的情形，应该先发动群众，然后依靠积极分子监督帮助造清册。
    四、应严格责成各部门主管详细清点，可以避免主管人袖手旁观不负责任的现象。
    五、在清点工作结束之后接着展开“整理家务”运动，不但把厂子打扫了一番，而且找回了不少废弃的材料工具，不啻是清点运动的延长。
    六、很多报废的器材中有许多并不完全不能用，其中有好些附件可以取下来应用的。
