Some Problems in the Recovery and Development of Beijing's Special Handicraft Industry
    Our reporter Feng Zhong

    Beijing's special handicrafts include nineteen kinds such as carpets, bone ware, ivory, drawnwork embroidery, carved lacquer, embroidery, velvet paper flowers, porcelain firing, enamel, jade ware, inlay, silver filigree enamel, filigree, glasswork, copper and tin ware, toys, palace lanterns, jade trees, and iron flowers. Special handicrafts are Beijing's main export products along with pig bristles. Before the War of Resistance Against Japan, the annual output value of various special handicrafts was worth 70 to 80 million U.S. dollars. During the war, it decreased year by year. In the year from September 1947 to August 1948, the annual output value was only over 10 million U.S. dollars. By the end of August 1948, the Kuomintang reactionary government "reformed the currency system" and stipulated unreasonable exchange rates. Foreign exchange in the Kuomintang-controlled areas was controlled by a small number of bureaucratic capitalists headed by the four major families. The export of handicrafts suffered a fatal blow. After a handicraft was exported, the merchant received an exchange settlement certificate. When he took the certificate to the bank, the money he exchanged was not U.S. dollars, but pseudo-gold yuan converted at an unreasonable exchange rate. With this money, he could not buy back the same handicraft. This forced various factories to shut down one after another, and handicraft workers changed jobs. By the eve of liberation, only a few factories continued to operate.
    According to a survey, there are 1,125 large and small factories for the nineteen kinds of special handicrafts in Beijing, with 12,842 handicraft workers, and no less than 200,000 people who depend on this for a living. After the liberation of Beijing, under our Party's policy of protecting national industry and commerce, and with the gradual increase in sales (mostly to Hong Kong), handicraft workers who had changed jobs returned one after another to prepare for resuming work. About three-tenths have already resumed work. The reasons why the un-reopened factories haven't resumed work are approximately the following: (1) Lack of capital. (2) Since August of last year, there have been no sales for half a year, and too many goods have been accumulated, making it difficult to sell them all at once. (3) Factory owners still have concerns, fearing that workers will want to divide up his factory, These issues have now been answered. Various handicraft workers have jointly requested the People's Bank for exchange settlement and loans, and the bank is conducting an investigation. The recently announced reasonable foreign exchange management method for the North China region will allow for a large number of exports in the future. After the Municipal Government Industry and Commerce Bureau's explanation, many factory owners slowly understood what "both public and private interests are taken care of and that labor and capital both benefit" means, and they are no longer afraid. So they are all actively preparing to resume work.
    Sales are a central issue: Since it is entirely for export trade, it is necessary to compete for a place in the international market. Japan also has carpets, enamel, porcelain firing, jade ware, and ivory; Czechoslovakia has filigree; France has porcelain firing, Turkey has carpets; India has ivory; Although their products are not as refined as Beijing's products, they are cheaper. If Beijing's products are to compete in the international market, costs must be reduced.
    Middlemen exploitation is also a major issue: For decades, handicraft workers have rarely had external contacts. The export of a special handicraft has to go through several layers of exploitation by traders, matchmakers, and importers before it can be sold in foreign stores. In this way, the price of the goods must be increased by at least 20%. When purchasing finished products, traders habitually make all kinds of nitpicking and haggling, giving prices at 70% or 80% of the original, causing significant damage to actual producers. The People's Government should assist various special handicraft industries to establish a joint organization to directly handle exports on behalf of various industries and eliminate middlemen exploitation.
    Tax rate issue: Without affecting national tax revenue, taxes on exported special handicrafts can be appropriately reduced. If trading companies can temporarily collect a portion of the finished products before handicrafts can be exported in large quantities, it is also a feasible way to solve the problem.
    Special raw materials are also a relatively big issue. Gold and silver (gold plating and soldering copper wire with silver) must be used to make enamel cloisonné, but they are difficult to purchase. If wool yarn for weaving carpets can be transported from the Northwest, it can be 30% to 40% cheaper than buying it locally. Some raw material merchants often raise prices speculatively (for example, if a factory accepts an order for a large quantity of goods and must use a large amount of copper and tin, the copper and tin merchants will immediately raise the price). This problem also needs to be properly resolved.

　　北平特种手工业恢复与发展中的一些问题
    本报记者  冯仲
    北平的特种手工业有地毯、骨器、象牙、挑补花、雕漆、刺绣、绒纸花、烧瓷、珐琅、玉器、镶嵌、银蓝、花丝、料器、铜锡器、玩具、宫灯、玉树、铁花等十九种。特种手工艺品是北平和猪鬃并驾的主要出口货。在抗日战争以前，各种特种手工艺品年产可值七、八千万美元，战争期间一年年减少，到一九四七年九月至一九四八年八月的一年，年产总值仅一千余万美元。到一九四八年八月末，国民党反动政府“改革币制”，规定了不合理的外汇率，国民党统治区外汇都操在以四大家族为首的少数官僚资本家手里，手工艺品的出口遭到致命打击；一件工艺品出口了，商人得到结汇证后，拿证到银行换回的钱，不是美金，而是按不合理的外汇率折合成的伪金圆券，用这笔钱买不回同样的一件手工艺品。这样逼得各厂陆续停工，手艺工人转业，到解放前夕，继续开工的已寥寥无几了。
    据调查，北平的十九种特种手工业共有大小厂子一一二五家，手艺工人一二八四二人，依此为生的不下二十余万人。北平解放后，在我党保护民族工商业的政策下，又加货品销路渐畅（大部销香港），各厂改业的手艺工人陆续返回，准备复业。现已有十分之三复了工。未复工的厂子约有以下原因：（一）资本缺乏。（二）去年八月起，半年来一直没销路，货品堆积过多，一下不易销出。（三）厂主仍有顾虑，恐怕工人要分他的厂子，这些问题，现在也已得到答案，各手工艺者曾联合向人民银行请求结汇、贷款，银行正在进行调查。最近合理的华北区外汇管理办法公布，以后可以大量出口，许多厂主经过市府工商局的解释，也慢慢明白了什么叫“公私兼顾，劳资两利”，不再恐惧。所以都在积极准备复工。
    销路是一个中心问题：既然是完全作出口买卖，就要在国际市场上争地位。日本也有地毡、珐琅、烧瓷、玉器、象牙；捷克斯拉夫有花丝；法国有烧瓷，土耳其有地毡；印度有象牙；他们的产品虽不如北平的出品精细，但价格低廉，北平出品要在国际市场上竞争，必须减低成本。
    中间剥削也是个大问题：几十年来，手工艺者很少对外联络，一件特种手工艺品的出口，要经过贸易商，跑合的，以及进口商等好几层剥削，才能摆在国外的商店出售。这样，货品的价格至少要提高二成。贸易商在收购成品的时候，又惯例地百般刁难挑剔，给价七折八扣，使实际生产者时常遭受重大打击；人民政府应协助各种特种手工业成立一个联合机构，代表各业直接办出口，取消中间剥削。
    税率问题：在不影响国家税收的原则下，对出口的特种手工艺品可适当减税，手工艺品未能大量出口之前，贸易公司如能暂收一部分成品，也是解决问题的可行办法。
    特种原料　也是比较大的问题，作珐琅景泰蓝必须用金银（镀金和用银焊铜丝），但购买困难。织地毡用的羊毛线，如能由西北运来，可比当地买便宜三、四成。有些原料商往往投机式地涨价（如某一厂子接受了某种大宗货的订单，必须用大量铜锡，铜锡商即立刻抬高价钱），这问题也需要适当解决。
