　　Xu Changxun, Director of Military Industry's Second Major Factory, Violates Discipline and Refuses Work Inspection
    North China People's Government Instructs the Enterprise Department to Educate Him
    [Our Newspaper] In response to the incident of Xu Changxun, director of the Second Military Industry Factory, refusing the work inspection by Deputy Director Yu Li of the Supervisory Yuan, the North China People's Government has ordered the Enterprise Department, the department in charge of the factory, to conduct an in-depth struggle against anarchism and lack of discipline in order to improve work and increase production. In November of last year, Deputy Director Yu, under the order of the North China People's Government and with a letter of introduction from the Enterprise Department, inspected factories under the department, and when he arrived at the Changzhi Second Military Industry Factory, he was openly refused by Director Xu of the factory under the pretext of military secrets because he did not have a letter of introduction specifically for the factory. Even a visit was not allowed. Director Yu made four trips back and forth for this purpose, and once waited for three hours, but Director Xu ignored him and did not pay attention to him. Finally, although they met, Xu's attitude was arrogant and he still refused the inspection. He also raised various dissatisfactions with Comrade Xu Daben of the department to Director Yu in a complaining tone. Deputy Director Yu then telegraphed the Enterprise Department about this and asked for an introduction, but did not receive a definite reply from the department. He then reported the incident to the North China People's Government. After the government investigated with several telegrams, Director Xu telegraphed his self-criticism in February of this year, admitting that his "concepts were vague, he was arrogant to superiors, which violated principles, and was a serious error of being unorganized and undisciplined," and was willing to receive the appropriate punishment from the superiors. In order to make Xu Changxun further recognize his mistake, the North China government pointed out in a circular that the factory director's thinking was arrogant and conceited, and he had committed liberalism, which could easily lead to anarchism, lack of discipline, and independence. He should make a more profound reflection, but considering that the factory director had already made a self-criticism, the Enterprise Department was instructed to continue to educate him, and no punishment was given. As for the Enterprise Department, it should also be held responsible for its improper handling because it did not do enough to assist the Supervisory Yuan in carrying out inspection tasks and its instructions to Director Xu were not clear.

　　军工二大厂厂长徐长勋违反纪律拒绝检查工作
    华北人民政府责成企业部加以教育
    【本报讯】华北人民政府为军工二大厂厂长徐长勋拒绝监察院于力副院长检查工作事，特令该厂主管部企业部深入开展反对无政府无纪律的斗争，以改进工作，提高生产。去年十一月间，于副院长奉华北人民政府命令并持有企业部介绍信，检查该部所属工厂，及到长治军工二大厂时，因未持专给该厂之介绍信，遭该厂徐厂长以军工秘密为词，公然拒绝，虽参观亦不可得，于院长为此往返四次，且有一次坐候三小时之久，徐厂长亦任其默候，不加理睬；最后虽得见面，徐态度傲慢，依然拒绝检查，并当于院长以发牢骚口气提出对该部徐达本同志种种不满意见，于副院长以此又曾电知企业部，请为介绍，也未得该部确复，遂将经过报告华北人民政府，经政府数电追查，迄今年二月，徐厂长始复电自我检讨，承认自己“观念模糊，对上级傲慢，致违原则，实为无组织无纪律的严重错误”，并愿上级给以应得处分。华北政府为使徐长勋进一步认识其错误，特于通令中指出该厂厂长思想上存在自高自大，且犯了自由主义，极易走上无政府无纪律闹独立性的前途，应再作深刻反省，惟认为该厂长既自作检讨，因责成企业部继续加以教育，可不处分。至企业部，也因对协助监察院执行检查任务，未尽周到，对徐厂长指示亦不明确，应负处理不当责任。
