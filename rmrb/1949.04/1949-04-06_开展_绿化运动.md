Launch a "Greening Campaign"

　　At the North China New Youth League Congress, which opened on April 3rd, Comrade Bo Yibo called for the launch of a "greening campaign," advocating horticulture and the planting of more vegetables. This work is now being promoted in cities such as Beiping and Baoding, as well as in the vast rural areas of North China. Here, we offer some suggestions regarding afforestation for local reference.

　　In the past period, cadres at all levels personally took action, integrated with the masses, helped them solve difficulties, mobilized and organized them to plant large numbers of trees to eliminate sandy wastelands, and united experienced farmers to form tree associations and afforestation committees to promote this work. In addition, governments at all levels in mountainous or sandy wasteland areas have professional cadres, enabling afforestation to achieve certain results. Facts have proven that as long as leading cadres go deep into the masses, understand the soil, climate, and the demands of the masses in each region, and mobilize and organize the masses to afforest accordingly, things will be done well.

　　However, on the one hand, the masses deeply understand the benefits of afforestation through personal experience, while on the other hand, they still have concerns such as "fear of damage." This is the biggest ideological obstacle existing among the masses in carrying out the afforestation movement today. Although forest protection has been repeatedly proposed in the past, it has not achieved the desired results due to insufficient implementation and lack of inspection. Although the government has not yet promulgated regulations, local areas have or can use announcements and meetings to emphasize forest protection and prevent damage, and county and district cadres should, as far as possible, specifically help each village to formulate forest protection covenants, and assign dedicated personnel to manage them, solving local practical problems according to local conditions. Furthermore, mobilizing the masses to protect forests must be combined with the interests of the masses themselves. State-owned and collectively-owned forests can allow nearby masses to prune, thin, and engage in sideline production such as digging medicinal materials according to designated methods and times. This will help inspire and enhance the masses' enthusiasm for protecting trees and will also be conducive to the growth of trees.

　　In addition, many places emphasized opposing destruction during land reform and stipulated that logging must be approved by the village peasant association. Under certain conditions in the past, this was correct. At present, land reform has been completed in most areas, and land rights and tree rights have been determined. This method can be changed, and trees related to security should preferably be approved by the village forest protection committee, and then jointly studied to determine the handling method.

　　At the same time, nurseries should also be established in large numbers to cultivate tree species that the masses like most and are suitable for planting, and vacant land and mountains should be used extensively for afforestation. In cities, while planting a large number of vegetables, seize the season around Qingming (which is now). It is hoped that all groups, organizations, schools, and the people of the city will mobilize to step up afforestation and turn Comrade Bo Yibo's call into reality.

### 开展“绿化运动”

　　开展“绿化运动”
    在四月三日开幕的华北新青团代表大会上，薄一波同志号召开展“绿化运动”，提倡园艺，多种蔬菜。现在北平、保定等城市以及华北广大农村，正在推行这一工作。这里，我们仅就植树造林工作，提供一些意见，供各地参考。
    在过去一段时间内，各地干部亲自动手，和广大群众打成一片，帮助他们解决困难，发动和组织了他们去大量植树造林，以消灭砂荒地带，并团结了广大富有造林经验的农民，成立树会、造林委员会等，以推动这一工作。此外在山地或砂荒地带各级政府设有专业干部，使植树造林工作获得了一定成绩。事实证明，只要领导干部深入群众，了解了各地区的土壤、气候以及群众要求，据此去发动和组织群众造林，事情就会办好的。
    但是，一方面群众由于亲身体验，深知植树造林的利益，而另一方面仍有“怕破坏”等的顾虑，乃是今天开展植树造林运动上存在于群众中的最大思想障碍。关于林木保护，过去虽曾一再提出，但因执行不够认真和很少检查，致未能收到应有效果。目前政府虽未颁布条例，但各地已有或可用布告与会议强调护林和防止破坏，并尽可能由县、区干部具体帮助各村订立护林公约，并派定专人掌管，按当地情况解决当地实际问题。再，发动群众护林，必须与群众本身利益结合，国有、公有森林，可允许附近群众按照指定办法与时间，修枝间伐及进行刨药材等副业生产，这样才能启发与提高群众积极保护林木兴趣，同时也有利于林木的成长。
    另外，许多地方在土地改革中强调反对破坏，规定砍伐林木必须经过村农会批准，在过去一定条件下，这是对的。目前大部地区土地改革已经完成，地权、树权业已确定，可以变更此种办法，而有关保安作用的树木，最好经过村的护林委员会的许可，然后再共同研究，确定处理办法。
    与此同时，还应大量建立苗圃，育植群众最喜欢的、适合栽植的树种，大量利用闲地、山地去植树造林。在城市来讲，与大量种菜同时，抓紧清明前后（就是现在）的季节，希望各团体、机关、学校及全市人民动员起来，加紧植树造林，把一波同志的号召变成事实。
