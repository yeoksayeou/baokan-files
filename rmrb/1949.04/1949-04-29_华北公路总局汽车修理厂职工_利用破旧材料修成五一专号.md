Employees of the North China Highway Bureau Automobile Repair Shop
　　Use Old and Broken Materials to Repair a "May First Special" Vehicle
    [Our Paper's Dispatch] With the active efforts of all employees, the Automobile Repair Shop of the North China Highway Bureau overcame the difficulty of material shortages and completed the car repair task using old and broken machine parts. After resuming work on March 29, the workers spontaneously launched a crash work effort. The factory had twenty-eight dilapidated cars, originally planned to be dismantled in two weeks, but it was completed in six days. Workers like Chen Kui collected machine parts from scrap iron and turned them in; electrical workers pieced together eleven good batteries from dismantled bad batteries. Recently, workers Liu Xiaoyou, Fu Wanli, and others, even repaired a "May First Special" vehicle from old and broken materials, and the paint workers painted it brand new. This car was originally planned to be completed in two weeks, but it was completed in only ten days. The entire factory repaired a total of eighteen cars in about forty days. During the Kuomintang rule, with the same time and manpower, the entire factory could only produce a maximum of eight cars. In the past, it was not enough to use four gallons of gasoline for a major overhaul of a car, but now one and a half gallons is enough.

　　华北公路总局汽车修理厂职工
  　利用破旧材料修成五一专号
    【本报记】华北公路总局汽车修理厂在全体职工积极努力下，利用破旧机器零件，克服材料缺乏的困难，完成修车任务。该厂在三月二十九日复工以后，工人即自动突击工作。厂内有二十八部破烂汽车，原计划两个礼拜拆完，结果六天就拆完了。工人陈奎等从废铁中检出机器零件来交公；电气工人将拆下的坏电瓶拚凑成十一个好电瓶。最近工人刘孝友、傅万利等，更将破旧的材料修成了一辆“五一专号”，油漆工人又把它刷的焕然一新。这部车原计划两礼拜完成，但只十天就修成了。全厂四十天左右一共修好十八部汽车。国民党统治期间，同样时间与人力，全厂最多出车八部。过去大修一部车子用四加仑汽油还不够，现在一加仑半就够了。
