(Tianjin Dispatch) Many pre-liberation Tianjin export/import licenses issued by the puppet Transportation Management Committee have already settled foreign exchange, but the goods have not yet arrived or been exported. The North China Foreign Trade Control Bureau has specifically stipulated the following handling methods:

I. For Goods with Settled Foreign Exchange but Not Yet Arrived in Tianjin:

(1) License Extension: All licenses that have already settled foreign exchange, whether expired or not, where the goods have not yet arrived in Tianjin, must apply to this Bureau for an extension before the end of April. An extension of three months will be granted from the date of application. If three months is insufficient for machine parts due to manufacturing time, a further extension will be granted.

(2) Goods Already Arrived in Shanghai and Other Domestic Ports: All must be registered with this Bureau before April 15th. For those already arrived in Shanghai or other ports, the cargo owner must still find a way to transport them to Tianjin. For those arriving at the port after December 15th and having completed tax payments, they can present the tax payment certificate to Tianjin Customs to request exemption from tariffs. For goods stored in Shanghai or other port warehouses that cannot be shipped out or picked up, the foreign exchange bank may cable its Shanghai or other branch to assist the merchant in handling the pickup procedures. However, two guarantors, including the bank or a reputable merchant, must guarantee that after the goods are taken out and sold, the same goods will be shipped back from other ports using self-provided foreign exchange import methods, to be completed within two months.

(3) Goods Already Arrived in Hong Kong or Still at the Place of Dispatch Prepared to Ship to Hong Kong for Transshipment: Must be registered with this Bureau before April 15th. Those already in Hong Kong must be shipped to Tianjin within two months; those not yet shipped from the place of dispatch, prepared to be shipped to Hong Kong for transshipment, are allowed to note "Via Hong Kong" on the letter of credit, but two guarantors, including the designated bank for foreign exchange settlement or a reputable merchant, must guarantee that the goods will arrive in Tianjin within four months.

(4) New import/export business licenses will not be issued until the above situations have been completely resolved.

II. For Goods with Settled Foreign Exchange but Not Yet Exported:

(1) Those whose export foreign exchange has been fully settled are allowed to ship out all goods (unified sales goods are not included).

(2) Those whose export foreign exchange has only been partially settled will be allowed to ship out the portion for which foreign exchange has been settled (unified sales goods are not included).

(3) Unified sales goods are still not allowed to be exported independently, but can be compensated for with other non-unified sales export goods of equal value.

(4) Before the goods are shipped out, an export license must still be obtained from the North China Foreign Trade Control Bureau. When applying for the license, the foreign exchange settlement certificate from the designated bank should be submitted for verification.
