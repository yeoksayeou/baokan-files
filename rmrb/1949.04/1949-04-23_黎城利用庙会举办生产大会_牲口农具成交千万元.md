　　Licheng Utilizes Temple Fair to Hold Production Conference
  　Livestock and Farm Implements Transactions Reach Ten Million Yuan
    [Our Dispatch] Our reporter Li Wen reports: In order to facilitate farmers' purchase of livestock and farm implements for large-scale production, the Licheng County government instructed all districts in early last month to focus on holding production conferences, utilizing farmers' pre-existing temple fair habits and dates. Districts 2, 3, and 4 have already been held. The Dongguan Production Conference in the county was hosted by the county government and the county cooperative. During the conference, current affairs and large-scale production education were carried out among the masses in various forms. More than 20 doctors were gathered to set up a health exhibition room to explain methods for preventing spring epidemics and various diseases. The reception team was responsible for solving accommodation problems for merchants from afar. Several days before the conference, the conference preparatory committee went to neighboring urban and rural areas to call on farmers to prepare goods for trading at the fair. During the Dongguan town production conference, farmers from Xiangyuan, Lucheng, Huguan, and other places within a hundred miles traveled long distances to attend. For the first three days, the number of people attending the fair was no less than 30,000 per day. The total transaction amount reached more than 10.08 million yuan (RMB, same below), mainly in livestock (more than 230 heads traded, worth more than 6.1 million yuan), farm implements (more than 760,000 yuan), ironware (more than 160,000 yuan), and cloth (more than 1.1 million yuan). In particular, farm implements were all sold out on the fourth day of the conference (the conference lasted for six days). The above facts fully reflect the enthusiasm of farmers for active production. The leadership of the county was able to pay attention to using the old temple fair format to hold production conferences and carried out propaganda and education work on current affairs and large-scale production. This is good. If cooperatives and others can be organized before the meeting to carry out planned adjustments according to the needs of farmers (such as raising a large number of needed items from producing areas, or absorbing and solving the sales of local farmers' local products at the meeting), it will play a greater role in the current spring plowing and this year's large-scale production campaign.

　　黎城利用庙会举办生产大会
  　牲口农具成交千万元
    【本报讯】本报记者力文报导：为便利农民添购牲口、农具进行大生产，黎城县府于上月初曾指示各区利用农民旧有的庙会习惯与日期，有重点地举办生产大会。现二、三、四区均已开过。该县东关生产大会系由县府、县联社主持。会中利用各种形式在群众中进行了时事与大生产教育，又约集了二十多名医生，设立卫生展览室，讲解防治春瘟及各种疾病的方法；并由招待股负责解决远途客商的住宿问题。大会筹委会在会期前数日，曾分赴邻近各城乡，号召农民筹备货物赶会交易。该镇生产大会期间，百里内外之襄垣、潞城、壶关等地农民都远道赶来，前三天赶会人数每日不下三万人左右。成交总额计达一千零八十余万元（人民币，下同），主要为牲口（成交二百三十余头，六百一十余万元）、农具（七十六万余元）、铁货（十六万余元）、布匹（一百一十余万元）几项，其中特别是农具，在大会第四天（会期共六天）便全部销完。以上事实充分地反映了农民积极生产的热忱。该县领导上能注意利用旧有庙会形式举办生产大会，并进行了时事与大生产等宣传教育工作，这是好的；如能在会前组织合作社等，根据农民的需要，进行有计划的调剂（如由产区筹集大批农民需要品，或在会上吸收与解决当地农民土产品的销售），则对当前春耕、今年大生产运动，会起到更大的作用。
