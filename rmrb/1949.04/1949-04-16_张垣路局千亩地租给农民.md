　　Thousands of Mu of Land Leased to Farmers

　　[Chahar News] The Zhangjiakou Railway Bureau recently decided to lease over a thousand mu of land along the railway to poor farmers in villages along the line for cultivation. This batch of land was originally reserved for quarrying soil for roadbeds. However, during the rule of the Kuomintang bandit gang, due to lack of responsible management, over a thousand mu of fertile land was left barren. This measure by the Zhangjiakou Railway Bureau will increase income for both farmers and the country.

　　张垣路局
  　千亩地租给农民
    【察哈尔讯】张家口铁路分局，顷决定将铁路沿线的千余亩土地，租给沿路村庄贫苦农民耕种。这批土地原为预备垫道取土而留出的。但在国民党匪帮统治时期，因无人负责管理，致使千余亩良田都荒芜了。张家口铁路分局此种措施，将使农民和国家都增加收入。
