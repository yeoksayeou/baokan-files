　　Ji'nan Fifth Special District Pays Attention to Farming Season

　　Spring Land Mostly Cultivated
    Households Without Livestock Awaiting Assistance
    [From Our Newspaper] According to the "Ten-Day Report Compilation" of the Ji'nan Fifth Special District Commissioner's Office on March 23rd: Spring land throughout the entire special district has been universally plowed and harrowed. According to statistics from the Sixth District of Hengshui, 70 to 80 percent of the spring land has been harrowed one to two times, 25 percent has been plowed but not harrowed, and only about 7 percent of the land has not been plowed. This unplowed land belongs to new middle peasants or elderly, weak, orphaned, and widowed households without livestock. (Note: The Fifth Special District Commissioner's Office governs six counties including Hengshui, Ji County, Jing County, Wuyi, Fudong, and Zaoqiang.)
