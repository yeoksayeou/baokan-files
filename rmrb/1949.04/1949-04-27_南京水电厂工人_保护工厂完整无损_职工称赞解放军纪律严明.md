Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, April 25th: (Delayed) When the Kuomintang bandits fled in disarray, workers at the Nanjing Waterworks and Power Plant spontaneously organized to protect the factories. After the People's Liberation Army entered the city, they immediately dispatched troops to guard them, and the two plants resumed supplying water and electricity as usual. Before the People's Liberation Army entered the city, more than a hundred workers at the waterworks organized a guard patrol to protect the plant, ensuring that the plant's machinery remained intact. Zhang Jingzeng, a worker at the rapid filtration pool, said, "The people are now in charge, and the factory belongs to the workers themselves, so we must protect it well." When the city was in chaos, the power plant workers stopped generating electricity for three hours for fear of fire, but immediately resumed work after seeing the People's Liberation Army. Worker Sun Kejian said, "We feel relieved now that the comrades have arrived. We have managed to protect the factory." Machine workers Peng Chuyuan and Li Guanyi both said: Nanjing used to be dark, but we must not let it be dark again. We must make it shine brightly. Both the workers and the factory director were extremely moved by the People's Liberation Army's care for the factory, and expressed their deep disgust at the Kuomintang bandit army's frenzied acts of destruction during their escape. Xu Zhuo, director of the waterworks, said: "I have been working on this project for thirteen years, and I have never seen a team with such good discipline as the People's Liberation Army. The armed comrades who protect our factory strictly maintain order within the factory and properly protect it, allowing the factory to operate smoothly." Sun Jiayi, a worker at the power plant, said: The Kuomintang is so inhumane, destroying so many ships! They don't want to live anymore, and they don't want others to live either, but we must survive, and we must live even better.

    【新华社南京二十五日电】（迟到）南京自来水厂和发电厂工人，在国民党匪帮狼狈逃窜时，自动组织起来保护工厂，解放军入城后，立即派兵守护，两厂即照常供应水电。自来水厂百余工人，在解放军入城前，曾组织护厂巡逻队防护，使该厂机器得以完好无损。快滤池工人张敬增说：“人民当家了，工厂是工人自己的了，得好好保护。”发电厂在城内秩序混乱时，工人们因怕火灾，曾停止发电三小时，但在见到解放军后，立即恢复工作。工人孙克俭说：“同志们来了，我们就放心了，我们算将工厂保护下来了。”机务工人彭楚源、李贯一都说：南京过去是黑暗的，现在不能再让它黑暗下去，我们要使它放出光明来。工人和厂长对于解放军爱护工厂都极为感动，而对国民党匪军逃跑时的疯狂破坏行为表示深恶痛绝。自来水厂厂长许卓说：“这工程我干了十三年了，从没有见过象解放军这样纪律好的队伍，保护我们工厂的武装同志，严守厂内秩序，妥善防护本厂，使厂内工作能够顺利进行。”发电厂工人孙家翼说：国民党太无人性了，毁坏了多少船只啊！他们不想活了，也不想让人家活，但我们一定要活下来，而且活得更好。
