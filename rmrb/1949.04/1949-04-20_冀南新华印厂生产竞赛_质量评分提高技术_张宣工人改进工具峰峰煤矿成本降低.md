　　【Jinnan Electric】The Jinnan Xinhua Printing Factory, based on a reasonable wage assessment, launched a production competition campaign. From December of last year to February 25th of this year, significant achievements were made, completing and exceeding the huge task of printing textbooks. Among the more than two hundred workers, eighty-five labor models emerged, including eleven Communist Party members and sixty-three young workers. In the movement, they motivated everyone with high production enthusiasm and pioneering roles. On March 21st, at the factory's enthusiastic celebration and award ceremony for model workers, the labor models proudly wore flowers and received prizes. Before the movement, a democratic assessment was made according to the progressive wage system stipulated by the Sixth Labor Congress. On this basis, the factory, in conjunction with the Party branch and the trade union, conducted ideological mobilization several times. The workers' awareness was raised, and encouraged by the victorious situation, the production competition was launched enthusiastically. At the same time, timely commendation and criticism from the leadership and the implementation of democratic management brought the production movement to a climax and ensured that it was implemented throughout. During the movement, the binding department, in addition to working ten hours a day, automatically increased night work. Zhao Ke Gong secretly got up at three o'clock in the night to work. They also automatically established mutual inspection, mutual handover and other systems, implemented cost accounting, and cultivated a large number of registration personnel. In order to improve quality and reduce waste, a quality scoring system was also established. The skills of apprentices were improved, and a large number of young workers were trained. Li Molin, an apprentice in the machine room, has been at the factory for eight months and can print 100,000 sheets a day using a foot-operated machine. His skill is quite proficient. The binding department cherishes and saves every stitch and thread, and all exceed the plan in completing tasks. The lithography team exceeded the original plan by 44.7 percent, and the binding team exceeded it by 44.8 percent. Each member of other teams also greatly exceeded the original standards. Currently, all employees are in high spirits and express that "we will work harder in the future!"

    【Chahar News】Workers in state-owned enterprises in Zhangjiakou, Xuanhua, and other places actively studied technology and overcame many difficulties, which led to great achievements in restoring and developing industrial production. The "window stops" on passenger cars used to be cast in the foundry and then drilled with a machine drill. Now, the workers in the foundry have found a way to make them in advance on the sand mold, so that it is no longer necessary to drill holes after casting. Guo Wenman, a worker at the Shacheng Pumping Station, researched and installed a damper on the boiler, which not only increased the water supply rate but also saved 70 kilograms of coal per day. The coal used in the boilers of the Xiahuayuan Power Plant used to require sixteen people to take turns hammering by hand. Now the workers have invented a coal crushing machine, which only requires four people per day, saving twelve people. Three impellers in the water tower were broken. After research by the employees, they were successfully cast in copper in the factory's repair shop. The water tower is working as usual, so that power generation is not affected. Workers at the Chahar Provincial Enterprise Company's oil mill repaired the No. 3 oil press that had been broken since 1946. The problem with this machine was that the press knife was three inches short and the press knife's central axis was not level. The Kuomintang bandit army had repeatedly repaired it more than twenty times without success. After liberation, Chen Shaowen, a repair technician at the factory, automatically led the repair team to find a solution. The central axis of the press knife was not level, and there was no lathe, so they used a round file to file it. The press knife was three inches short, and there was no oxygen welding, so they used rivets to rivet it, and then filed it flat, finally repairing the machine. Liu Haishan, a worker at the Xuanhua Public Paper Mill, successfully researched electric welding rods. He used waste iron rods and a few simple medicines to make welding rods, which were used to weld pipes, steel shafts, windmills, etc. The effectiveness was the same as that of foreign-made ones. Now he has also used waste iron to make a windmill, which is installed on the blacksmith's furnace, which not only provides fast and strong wind but also eliminates the trouble of bellows blowing, and also saves a worker.

    【Taihang Electric】"Reduced costs" is the biggest feature of the production competition campaign launched successively by the state-owned Fengfeng Coal Mine plants since February. For example, in the use of underground odd-job workers in Factory No. 5, after precise calculation and regulations on usage methods, a total of 348 workers were saved in February, saving more than 60,000 yuan. The riveters in Factory No. 4 were originally planned to use eight workdays to repair each broken can, but with the efforts of the riveters, it was completed in only two and a half workdays. Since the formation of a shock team in Factory No. 2 on March 8, costs have been reduced by 37 percent, while work efficiency has been increased by 73 percent. In the past, Factory No. 2 dug coal for twelve hours a day, averaging 0.212 meters deep and four feet wide. Now, in eight hours, the average is 0.368 meters deep and four feet wide.

　　冀南新华印厂生产竞赛
  　质量评分提高技术
    张宣工人改进工具峰峰煤矿成本降低
    【冀南电】冀南新华印刷工厂，在合理评订工资的基础上，开展生产竞赛运动。自去年十二月开始，至今年二月二十五日止，获得显著成绩，完成并超过了印刷课本的巨大任务。全体二百余工人中，涌现出八十五名劳动模范，其中共产党员十一名，青年工人六十三名。他们在运动中，以高度的生产热忱与先锋作用带动了大家。三月二十一日，在全厂职工热烈的庆功奖励模范大会上，劳动模范们光荣的带上鲜花，受了奖品。运动前，按照六次劳大规定的交义累进工资制，作了民主的评订，在此基础上，厂方结合支部与工会，进行了三番五次的思想动员，工人觉悟提高，在胜利形势鼓舞下，生产竞赛遂热烈展开。同时由于领导上的及时表扬、批评，实行民主管理，使生产运动进入高潮，并能贯彻始终。运动中，装订房除每天十小时工作外，自动增加夜工。赵克恭夜里下三点就偷偷起来干活。并自动建立起互相检查、互相交班等制度，实行了成本计算，培养出大批登记人员。为了提高质量减少浪费，又建立起质量评分制度。提高了学徒技术，培养了大批青年工人。机器房学徒李墨林，到厂八个月，使用脚蹬机每天能印十万张，技术相当熟练。装订房一针一线都十分爱惜、节省，在完成任务上无不超过计划。石印股超过原计划的百分之四四点七，装订股超过百分之四四点八。其他各股，每人也都倍超原订标准，现全体职工情绪正高，均表示“今后将更加努力生产！”
    【察哈尔讯】张家口，宣化等地各公营企业工人，积极钻研技术，克服不少困难，使恢复与发展工业生产获得很大成绩。客车上的“窗户止铁”，过去是在翻砂房铸成后再用机器钻床打眼，现在翻砂房工人研究出在砂模上预先做好，铸成以后不用再费一道手续去打眼。沙城水泵房工人郭文满，研究出在锅炉上装一个风门，不但供水率比过去高，每日还可节省七十公斤煤。下花园发电厂的锅炉用煤，过去需要十六个人轮流用手砸，现在工人们发明了一个砸煤机，每天只需四个人，节省了十二个人。水塔里坏了三个水轮，经职工研究，在本厂修理室用铜铸制成功，水塔照常工作，使发电免受影响。察省企业公司榨油厂工人，将一九四六年就坏了的三号榨油机修好，这个机器毛病是榨刀短三寸和榨刀中轴不平，国民党匪军在时反复修理二十多次始终没修好。解放后，该厂修理技工陈绍文即自动领导修理组工人想办法，榨刀中轴不平，没有旋床，就用圆锉锉，榨刀短三寸没有氧气接就用铆钉铆住，然后再用锉锉平，终将该部机器修好。宣化公营造纸厂工人刘海山，研究电焊棍成功。他利用废铁棍配合了几种简单的药品，制成焊条，焊的管子、钢轴、风车等，效力和外来的一样。现在他又用废铁做成风车一个，按装在打铁的炉上，不但风来的快，火力强，也免去风匣吹风的麻烦，还节省一个工人。

    【太行电】“降低了成本”，这是国营峰峰煤矿各厂自二月先后开展生产竞赛运动以来的最大特点。如五厂在使用坑下杂工上，经精确计算，及规定使用办法后，二月份共省工三百四十八个，节省开支六万多元；四厂铆工匠修理破罐，原计划每个需工八个，在铆工努力下，只用两个半工即完成。而二厂自三月八日组成突击组后，成本降低了百分之三十七，工作效率却提高了百分之七十三。二厂过去每工每天挖煤十二小时，平均挖进零点二一二米深，四尺宽。现在，八小时，则平均挖进零点三六八米，四尺宽。
