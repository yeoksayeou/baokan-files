Kuznetsov pointed out that the Soviet people have won new and significant victories in further enhancing the power of the socialist motherland and in the struggle to build a communist society. This congress is being held under these conditions. The task facing the congress is to summarize the achievements of trade unions in their activities in the process of building a socialist society and to plan how trade unions will participate in the struggle for the victory of communism in the future.
    After electing the presidium, secretariat, drafting committee, and credentials committee, the congress immediately adopted the following agenda: (1) Report of the Central Committee of Soviet Trade Unions and report of the Supervisory Committee; (2) Discussion and adoption of the trade union constitution; (3) Election of the Central Committee and Supervisory Committee of Soviet Trade Unions.

The people of the world do not want war and believe in the possibility of maintaining peace. They believe in the strength and influence of the World Federation of Trade Unions, which embodies the international solidarity of the majority of working people around the world. I can assert that the World Federation of Trade Unions will play a huge role in the struggle for peace and will stand at the forefront of the fighters against a new war.
