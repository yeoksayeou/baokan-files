  　Heze Strengthens Policy Education for Small Vendors, Exposing Tactics of Large Businesses to Shift Burdens
    [Ji-Lu-Yu Telegram] The collection of industrial and commercial income tax in Heze this year has grasped the tax policies for each industry through democratic appraisal passed by the Chamber of Commerce. However, prior to the appraisal, there was a failure to conduct thorough investigations and research, and mobilize democratic discussions, leading to the discovery during the appraisal of some large businesses manipulating and creating disturbances, shifting burdens, and small businesses suffering losses but being afraid to speak out. When the Heze Cheng Guan District Tax Bureau issued the tax revenue tasks in January of this year, it convened a city-wide conference of industrialists, merchants, and employees to explain the industrial and commercial tax policies and called on merchants and citizens to actively pay taxes. Most of the larger industrial and commercial businesses in the urban area have joined the Chamber of Commerce, so during tax collection, the Chamber of Commerce system was used as the collection unit. According to the tax policy regulations, capital of three thousand yuan (RMB) or more would pay income tax, while capital of less than three thousand yuan would only pay license tax. Each industry elected members of the appraisal committee to form a sub-appraisal committee, appraising the total points each industry should receive. Based on the Chamber of Commerce's original number of households and the size of industrial and commercial businesses, the tax ratio points were appraised. The scoring method adopted was self-reporting and public discussion. At the first general appraisal meeting, only 7,500 points were recognized by thirteen industries such as tobacco and silk fabrics, far short of the 20,000 points. At this time, the leadership pointed out that the appraisal should consider the number of households in each industry, the size of capital, the scope of operations, the speed of turnover, and the level of profit rate to be more reasonable. However, industries were still reluctant to express opinions due to considerations of personal relationships. Therefore, the leadership proposed conducting the appraisal by voting, which everyone was quite satisfied with, and the voting results reached the required score. After the general scoring, in the sub-industry scoring, most industries, such as the hardware industry, were able to recognize their scores with a sincere attitude, and as a result, the merchants in the industry were very satisfied. Some industries failed to conduct the appraisal fairly and reasonably, with some large businesses manipulating it from behind the scenes to shift burdens, resulting in the phenomenon of large businesses receiving fewer points and small businesses receiving more points. For example, Fuxing Goods Store in the department store industry was a large business, but received very few points. Many small vendors relied on it for exchanging goods and credit, and therefore dared not express opinions. Similar situations existed in the yarn and cloth industry and the tobacco industry. Especially in the tobacco industry, some cadres initially abandoned leadership, and some larger factories failed to reach the industry's total score even after two appraisals. Later, after the leadership exposed their tactics of shifting burdens and enlightened and educated the small vendors, the small vendors dared to argue on the basis of reason regarding unreasonable appraisals, and after multiple struggles, the problem was resolved more reasonably.

　　评议所得说
  　菏泽加强小商贩政策教育揭穿大商家转嫁负担手段
    【冀鲁豫电】菏泽城区本年度工商业所得税的征收，掌握了民主评议通过商会分配给各行业的税务政策，但在评议之前，未能很好地进行调查研究和发动民主讨论，致评议对发现部分大商号操纵捣鬼，转嫁负担，小商户吃亏而不敢发言的现象。菏泽城关区税务局在本年一月税收任务下达时，即召开了全城工商业者及职工大会，讲解工商业税收政策，号召商民踊跃缴纳。城区较大工商业者，大部已参加商会，因此在征税时即以商会系统作为征收单位，按照税务政策的规定，三千元（人民币）以上的资本，缴纳所得税，不足三千元资本的，只纳牌照税。各业选举了本业的评委会委员，成立分评委会，评议各业应得的总分数。根据商会原来的户数及工商业大小，评议纳税比例分数。评分的方式，采取自报公议。第一次总评委会上，烟草、绸布等十三行业，仅认到七千五百分，距两万分相差甚远。这时领导上提出：评议应把各业户数多少，资金的大小，经营的范围，周转的快慢，利润率的高低等条件联系起来作根据，才较合理。但各行业间仍碍于情面不肯提意见。因此，领导上即提出以投票方式进行评议，大家颇为满意，投票结果才达到应征分数。总评分后，在分业进行评分中，大部行业如五金业等，都能以诚恳态度自认分数，结果该业商户都很满意。有些行业则不能公平合理地进行评议，某些大商户从中操纵，转嫁负担，以致发现大商得分少，小商得分多的现象。如百货业的复兴货栈，是大商号，得分却很少，许多小商贩兑货、赊欠都依靠它，因之不敢提意见。其他纱布业、烟草业都有类似情况。尤其烟草业，开始有的干部放弃了领导，较大工厂有的两次评分都达不到该业总分，后经领导上揭穿其转嫁负担手段，并对小商户进行了启发教育，使小商贩对于不合理的评议敢于据理力争，而后经过多次斗争，才较合理的解决了问题。
