　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 15th: French and Belgian progressive public opinion has exposed the evil consequences of this aggressive plan for the two countries on the third of this month, the first anniversary of the implementation of the Marshall Plan. TASS reported: The French newspaper L'Humanité commented on the 5th, saying: Products delivered to France in accordance with the Marshall Plan are largely surplus goods that the United States must export anyway. A large amount of tobacco and dairy products are completely unnecessary for us. Production equipment accounts for only 2 percent of the large number of goods shipped by the United States. We are buying American coal at a high price of 21 US dollars per ton, while the government refuses our request to obtain coal from the Ruhr. Our blood is being bought for gold.

    The Belgian Red Flag pointed out: Due to American "aid," the United States, with the support of the Spaak government, has completely controlled Belgium and flooded the Belgian market with American goods, causing many industries to reduce production and workers to lose their jobs. The Marshall Plan has brought Belgium to the brink of disaster, and the North Atlantic Treaty will push Belgium onto the path of military gambling. The "Belgian Supply Federation" also pointed out in its bulletin that the Marshall Plan has caused Belgium to have excess imports, a decline in the production of some light industries, and a continuous increase in unemployment. The Spaak government is leading Belgium into the abyss. At the same time, the Belgian Industrial Association also admitted that unless American goods imports are reduced by two-thirds, the unemployment problem cannot be solved. It also believes that Belgium's inability to trade with Eastern European countries due to the restrictions of the Marshall Plan is an unfortunate thing.

　　法比进步舆论揭露“美援”恶果
    马歇尔计划使人民走向灾难
  　侵略公约又将西欧推到绝路
    【新华社北平十五日电】本月三日为马歇尔计划实施一周年，法国和比利时的进步舆论揭露了这一侵略计划对两国所造成的恶果。塔斯社报道：法国人道报五日著文评论称：依照马歇尔计划运交法国的产品，很大一部分是美国无论如何都必须输出的剩余货物。我们所完全不需要的大量烟叶和乳制品。美国运来的大量货物中，生产装备只占百分之二。我们以每吨二十一美元的高价，购买美煤，同时政府却拒绝我们要求获得鲁尔的煤。我们的鲜血正为黄金所收买。
    比利时红旗报指出：由于美“援”，美国在斯巴克政府支持下，完全控制了比利时，并以美货泛滥比利时市场，使不少工业减产，工人失业。马歇尔计划把比利时带到了灾难的边缘，而北大西洋公约则将使比利时推上军事赌博的道路。又“比利时供给联合会”公报也指出：马歇尔计划使比利时入超，若干轻工业生产下降及失业不断增加。斯巴克政府使比利时走向深渊。同时，比利时工业家协会也承认除非把美货输入减少三分之二，无法解决失业问题。并认为比利时因马歇尔计划之限制而不能与东欧各国贸易，是一件不幸的事情。
