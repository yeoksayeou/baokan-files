　　Conveys Resolutions of the National Women's Congress
    Emphasizes the Importance of Women Workers' Affairs

    [Reported by this newspaper] To ensure the thorough implementation of the guiding principles and tasks of the Chinese women's movement as determined by the National Women's Congress in Peiping, and to further the development of the Peiping Women's Federation, the Preparatory Committee of the Peiping Democratic Women's Federation convened representatives from various schools, government agencies, households, and professional fields yesterday (the 23rd) to convey the resolutions. A total of 237 representatives from 64 units, including Peking University, Normal University, Bridgman Academy, Daozhong Girls' Middle School, the Peiping Telecommunications Bureau, the People's Bank, and the Maternity and Child Health Hospital, attended. Comrade Wang Ruqi of the Peiping Municipal Women's Committee of the Chinese Communist Party delivered the briefing. As the attendees were primarily urban female intellectuals, the briefing elaborated in particular detail on urban work and the transformation of intellectuals. She emphasized: "To develop urban women's work, it is essential to first and foremost focus on the affairs of women workers. To advance urban production, it is necessary to organize general working women and housewives to participate in various cooperatives and mutual aid societies. Although the number of women workers in Peiping is not large, the work concerning women workers must be given top priority. Female intellectuals need to carry out self-transformation, overcome shortcomings, and wholeheartedly serve the workers and peasants." The briefing lasted three hours, and the representatives will return to their respective units to disseminate the information and organize discussions.
