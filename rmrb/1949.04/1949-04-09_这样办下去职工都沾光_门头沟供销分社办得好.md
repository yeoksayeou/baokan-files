　　By Doing This
  　The Workers All Benefit
  　Mentougou Supply and Marketing Cooperative is Doing Well
    [Ping City News] The Mentougou branch of the Beiping City Cooperative Supply and Marketing General Cooperative was established and began operations on the 15th of last month, supplying grain (previously supplied by the Trade Company's Second Grain and Coal Supply and Marketing Station, now uniformly supplied by the branch) as well as non-staple foods and daily necessities to the consumer cooperatives of the mines. There are currently three cooperatives in the area, with more than 3,900 members, and three sales agencies. Cooperative prices are generally 3 to 20 percent lower than market prices. Before the issuance of the first half of March wages at the Sino-British Mine and the Xishan Mine (both state-owned), an agreement was reached with the mines: if workers needed money (one-third of their wages were in millet), the mines would issue a slip, and the workers could use the slip to withdraw money from the district branch, with the district branch settling with the mines afterward. To facilitate buying and selling for members, special personnel were also dispatched to the cooperatives of these two mines to collect millet. As a result of this, the workers saved a lot of effort, and there were no fluctuations in the market. The workers are very satisfied. A worker at the Sino-British Mine said, "This method is good, saving effort and trouble; if we continue to do this, we won't suffer." A worker at the Xishan Mine said, "Carrying millet to the market takes effort, and there's weight loss, and the speculators try to exploit us. Doing it this way, we sell for less money and preserve the weight."
    In addition, the branch, in order to take care of the small kiln workers living in the Dongxi Xinfang area, is preparing to set up a shop in the branch to sell them rice, flour, and daily necessities before they organize a cooperative. 　 (Li Wenshuang)

　　这样办下去
  　职工都沾光
  　门头沟供销分社办得好
    【平市讯】北平市合作社供销总社门头沟分社成立，已于上月十五日起开始营业，供给矿厂职工消费合作社粮食（过去是由贸易公司第二粮煤供销栈供给，现在由分社统一供给）及副食品、日用品。该区现有三个合作社，三千九百余社员；另有三个代销社。合作社售价，一般都低于市价百分之三至二十。中英矿、西山矿（都是公营）在发三月份上半月工资前，即与矿方商好：工人如需要用钱（工资中有三分之一是小米）时，由矿方开单据，职工凭据到区分社支款，事后区社从矿方整取。为了照顾社员买卖方便，又派专人到该两矿合作社去收米。这样作的结果，职工省力很大，市场上也没有发生波动。职工们都很满意。中英矿一工友说：“这办法好，省力又省事；这样办下去，我们是不会吃亏的。”西山矿一工友说：“把小米背到市场上，费了力，又要脱分量，投机的买卖人还要想办法剥削，这样作，不少卖钱，又保住了分量。”
    又该分社，为了照顾东西辛房一带居住的小窑工人，在他们还没组织合作社以前，准备分社设一门市，卖给他们米、面及日用品。 　 （李文双）
