　　The Flour Mills of Beiping City

　　Of the original seventeen mechanized flour mills in this city, fifteen have resumed operation. The total production in March was 122,253 bags, exceeding the production level of the three years before liberation. In 1946, the average monthly production of ten flour mills was 85,773 bags. In 1947, the average monthly production of twelve flour mills was 121,548 bags. In 1948, the average monthly production of sixteen flour mills was 77,664 bags.

　　Last November, the fifteen flour mills that were operating had sixty-three machine grinders, working for thirty days, twelve hours a day, with a total output of 105,847 bags, averaging 4.7 bags per grinder per hour. This February, thirteen flour mills were operating with fifty-two machine grinders, working for twenty days, eleven hours a day, with a total output of 62,923 bags, averaging 5.5 bags per grinder per hour. This March, fifteen flour mills were operating with seventy-three machine grinders, working for twenty-five days, ten hours a day, with a total output of 122,253 bags, averaging 6.1 bags per machine grinder per hour. Therefore, not only has the production volume increased, but the productivity has also greatly improved.

　　The prosperity of the flour industry is a natural result of most flour mills improving workers' treatment, improving working conditions, and implementing a policy of mutual benefit for labor and capital. Taking Wanyu Hou Flour Mill as an example, wages were increased by 26% on February 28th. Before the wage increase, the ratio of factory profit to cost was 5.7%. After the wage increase, the profit decreased by 0.55 percentage points, with the ratio to cost being 5.15%, still yielding considerable profit.

　　Furthermore, since the liberation of Beiping, the financial situation has been stable, prices have been stable, and the industrial future is extremely promising. Therefore, the two of the seventeen mills that have not yet resumed operation are actively preparing to do so. The Xintai Flour Mill was severely damaged by the Kuomintang bandit troops. After two months of preparation, it will soon resume operation and has decided to increase from three machine grinders to six.

　　The seventeen flour mills in Beiping have a total of 657 employees, owning 76 flour milling machines, 28 flat sieving machines, 35 round sieving machines, 37 packaging machines, 24 wheat sieving machines, 26 wheat cleaning machines, 19 wheat washing machines, 33 flour bleaching machines, 19 suction fans, 23 bran machines, 18 stitching machines, and 66 motors totaling 2439 horsepower. The machine capacity is capable of producing 348,100 bags per month. Therefore, the flour industry in this city is just beginning to flourish.

### 平市的面粉厂

　　平市的面粉厂
    本市原有的十七家机制面粉厂，已复工十五家，三月份总生产量共一二二二五三袋，已超过解放前三年来的生产水准。一九四六年十家面粉厂平均月产八五七七三袋，一九四七年十二家面粉厂平均月产一二一五四八袋，一九四八年十六家面粉厂平均月产七七六六四袋。
    去年十一月，面粉厂开工的十五家，机磨六十三部，工作三十天，每天十二小时，总产量为一○五八四七袋，平均每部磨每小时生产四·七袋强。今年二月，开工十三家，机磨五十二部，工作二十天，每天十一小时，总产量六二九二三袋，每部磨平均每小时生产五·五袋。今年三月开工十五家，机磨七十三部，工作二十五天，每天十小时，总产量一二二二五三袋，每部机磨平均每小时生产六·一袋。因此，不仅是生产量增加，而且是生产率大大提高。
    面粉业的繁荣，是多数面粉厂提高工人待遇，改善劳动条件，执行了劳资两利政策的必然结果。以万裕厚面粉厂为例，二月二十八日增加工资，为原工资的一·二六倍，在增资以前厂方利润与成本的比例为百分之五·七，增加工资以后利润降低百分之点五五，与成本的比例为百分之五·一五，仍可获得可观的利润。
    更由于北平解放以来，金融稳定，物价平稳，工业前途极有发展，因此，十七家中未能复工的两家都在积极复工中，新泰面粉厂遭国民党匪军破坏严重，经过两个月的筹备，即将在最近期间复工，并决定由三部机磨增为六部。
    北平十七家面粉厂职工共六五七名，拥有制粉机七十六部，平筛机二十八部，元罗机三十五部，打包机三十七部，麦筛机二十四部，净麦机二十六部，洗麦机十九部，漂粉机三十三部，吸风机十九部，麸皮机二十三部，缝口机十八部，马达六十六台，共二四三九匹马力，机器能力每月可生产三四八一○○袋，因此，本市面粉工业的发达正是方兴未艾。
