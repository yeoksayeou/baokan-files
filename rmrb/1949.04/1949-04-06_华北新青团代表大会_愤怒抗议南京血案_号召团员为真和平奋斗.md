　　North China New Youth League Congress
  　Angrily Protests Nanjing Massacre
    Calls on Members to Strive for True Peace
    [Reported by this newspaper] The North China New Youth League Congress, currently in session, upon hearing the bloody crimes of the Nanjing reactionary government in massacring students, has issued a letter of protest, the text of which is as follows:
    Fellow countrymen, youth, and students across the country:
    The entire delegation of the First Congress of the New Democratic Youth League of North China protests with boundless indignation the bloody crimes of the Nanjing reactionary traitorous government in massacring, arresting, and wounding over two hundred patriotic students. The Nanjing reactionary traitorous government, on the one hand, sends representatives to Peiping to conduct peace talks, and on the other hand, opens fire on patriotic students who demand true peace. This not only proves that the so-called peace in the mouths of these reactionaries is completely false, but also once again exposes the hideous faces of the Nanjing war criminals, and once again tells the people of the whole country that the war criminals are the mortal enemies of the people and the mortal enemies of peace. If Chairman Mao's eight terms are not implemented one hundred percent, and if the war criminals are not resolutely punished, there will be no peace at all. We demand the immediate arrest and severe punishment of chief culprits such as Chiang Kai-shek, Tang Enbo, and Zhang Yaoming. We fully support the heroic Nanjing students, and all members of the New Democratic Youth League in North China are their backing, hoping that they will strengthen their unity and continue to strive for the realization of true peace throughout the country. We call on all members of the New Democratic Youth League in North China, all youth and students, to enthusiastically support the People's Liberation Army in crossing the Yangtze River, launch a southern expedition, quickly and thoroughly eliminate the Kuomintang's reactionary rule, liberate Nanjing, liberate all of China, and capture the war criminals one by one alive to avenge the dead students!
　　The First Congress of the New Democratic Youth League of China, North China　April 5th

　　华北新青团代表大会
  　愤怒抗议南京血案
    号召团员为真和平奋斗
    【本报讯】正在开会的华北新青团代表大会，闻悉南京反动政府屠杀学生的血腥罪行以后，特发出抗议书，原文如下：
    全国同胞、全国青年、全国同学们：
    华北新民主主义青年团第一届代表大会全体代表以无限愤慨的心情抗议南京反动卖国政府屠杀、逮捕、打伤两百余爱国同学的血腥罪行。南京反动卖国政府一面派出代表来平进行和谈，一面又对要求真和平的爱国学生开枪。这不仅证明这些反动派口中的所谓和平是完全虚伪，而且再一次暴露南京战犯们的狰狞面貌，再一次告诉全国人民，战犯们是人民的死敌，是和平的死敌，如果不百分之百实行毛主席的八项条件，如果不坚决惩办战犯，就决无和平可言。我们要求立即逮捕并严惩蒋介石、汤恩伯、张耀明等主凶。我们以全力支援英勇的南京同学们，全华北的新民主主义青年团团员都做他们的后盾，希望他们加紧团结，继续为实现全国真和平而奋斗。我们号召全华北的新民主主义青年团员，全体青年和学生，热烈支援人民解放军，渡江南征，迅速彻底消灭国民党的反动统治，解放南京，解放全中国，把战争罪犯一个一个活捉起来，为死难的同学们复仇！
