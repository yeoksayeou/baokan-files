　　Production Inspection Team Dispatched to Western Hebei
  　570,000 Mu of Spring Wheat Planted in Seven Counties Including Yutian, Eastern Hebei
    [Report from this newspaper] The Western Hebei District Committee organized a production inspection team on March 30th and dispatched them to Zhuo(xian)Liang(xiang)Wan(ping), Fangshan, and Lai(shui)Zhuo(xian) counties to conduct production inspections. Ruan Bosheng, the secretary of the district committee, personally arranged the team's tasks. The inspection's content mainly focused on the implementation of production plans, any remaining ideological problems at all levels of leadership, whether production organizations at all levels were sound, and the situation of labor organization. The inspection method adopted a top-down approach first, followed by a bottom-up approach. In each county, the team would conduct in-depth inspections of one village with relatively good production work and one village with relatively poor production work, delving into the households to discover problems, and holding various specialized investigation meetings.

    [Dispatch from Eastern Hebei] As of March 25th, incomplete statistics from the 15th District of Eastern Hebei show that 576,602 mu of spring wheat have been sown in seven counties including Yutian. The sown acreage in Fengrun, Ninghe, Zunhua, Yutian and other counties has exceeded the original plan. At present, wheat sowing is still progressing in various counties. According to this situation, it is estimated that more than 103,900 mu can still be completed before Grain Rain, which can exceed the original plan by more than 84,500 mu. The main reason for this achievement is that the government has promptly helped farmers solve difficulties such as a shortage of seeds. For example, the special district and various counties have organized production work teams and loaned 500,050 jin of wheat seeds, as well as the high production enthusiasm of farmers under the influence of the victorious situation.

　　平西派出生产检查团
  　冀东玉田等七县种春麦五十七万亩
    【本报讯】平西地委于三月三十日组织生产检查团，分赴涿良宛、房山、涞涿三县进行生产检查。地委书记阮伯生并亲自布置该团任务。检查内容主要是生产计划执行情形，各级领导思想上尚有哪些问题，各级生产组织是否健全与劳力组织情形等。检查方式，采取先自上而下，后自下而上的方式。每县深入检查一个生产工作比较好的村庄和较差村庄，深入到农户发现问题，并开各种专门的调查会议。

    【冀东电】冀东十五专区玉田等七县截止三月二十五日，据不完整统计，已播种春麦五十七万六千六百零二亩。其中丰润、宁河、遵化、玉田等县的播种亩数，均超过原订计划。目前各县种麦尚在继续进展，按此种情况估计，在谷雨节前尚可完成十万三千九百余亩，可以超过原订计划八万四千五百余亩。获得这种成绩的主要原因，是政府及时帮助农民解决了缺种等困难，如专区及各县均组织了生产工作队，并贷放麦种五十万零五千斤，以及农民在胜利的形势影响下，生产情绪的高涨。
