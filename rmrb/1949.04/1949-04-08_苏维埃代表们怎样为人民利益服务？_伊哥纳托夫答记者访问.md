Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 6th: Moscow dispatch: TASS reporter interviewed Ignatov, a deputy to the Supreme Soviet elected by the people of the Amavir region in the Krasnodar Territory of the North Caucasus. He vividly explained that Soviet deputies maintain close contact with the masses of the people and faithfully serve the interests of the people. Ignatov often receives petitions from local voters. Workers, engineers, industrial administrators, and farmers all asked him to help them restore factories, workshops, and collective farms destroyed by the German bandits. He mostly gave satisfactory answers to these requests. For example, the Amavir train station was the best station in the North Caucasus before the war. According to the city restoration plan, it will be rebuilt in 1950, but the local people decided to complete it ahead of schedule. Ignatov accepted their request and obtained the necessary funds and materials from the government. Residents voluntarily participated in the construction during their spare time, and the station has now been restored ahead of schedule. In addition, a young engineer was testing a design to accelerate lathe work, but it was put on hold due to difficult conditions. Ignatov also accepted his request and helped him complete his design.

　  怎样为人民利益服务？
  　伊哥纳托夫答记者访问
    【新华社北平六日电】莫斯科讯：塔斯社记者访问了北高加索克拉斯诺达边疆区阿马维尔地区人民所选出的最高苏维埃代表伊哥纳托夫。他生动地说明了苏维埃代表经常地和人民群众保持着密切联系，忠诚地为人民的利益服务。伊哥纳托夫经常接到当地选民的请求书。工人、工程师、工业行政人员和农民们，都要求他帮助他们恢复被德寇破坏了的工厂、作坊和集体农场。他对这些要求大都给了满意的答复。例如阿马维尔火车站在战前是北高加索最好的车站。按照城市恢复计划，它将在一九五○年重建起来，但是当地人民决定提前完成它。伊哥纳托夫接受了他们的请求，从政府得到了所需要的资金和材料。居民们自愿地利用闲暇时间参加建筑，现在已经提前修复了这个车站。此外，有一个年青的工程师试验一种加速车床工作的设计，因为条件困难而搁置了下来，伊哥纳托夫也接受了他的请求，帮助他完成了他的设计。
