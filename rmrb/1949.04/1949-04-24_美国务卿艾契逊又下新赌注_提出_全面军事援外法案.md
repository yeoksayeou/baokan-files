　　U.S. Secretary of State Acheson Makes Another New Bet
  　Proposes "Comprehensive Military Aid Bill"
    【Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 23rd】The long-brewing U.S. military aid to reactionary factions in various countries has taken concrete form. According to the USIS in Washington: U.S. Secretary of State Acheson submitted a "Comprehensive Military Aid Bill" to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on the 21st, stipulating $1.45 billion for the fiscal year of 1950 to be used for "aiding" reactionary factions in the North Atlantic countries and Greece and Turkey. The chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee will begin discussing the North Atlantic Treaty on the 28th, and then discuss the "Comprehensive Military Aid Bill." This bill is an important supplement to the Marshall Plan and a powerful footnote to the aggressive nature of the North Atlantic Treaty.

　　美国务卿艾契逊又下新赌注
  　提出“全面军事援外法案”
    【新华社北平二十三日电】酝酿已久的美国对各国反动派的军事援助，已经具体化。据美新闻处华盛顿讯：美国务卿艾契逊二十一日已向参院外委会提出“全面军事援外法案”，规定一九五○年财政年度以十四亿五千万美元作“援助”参加北大西洋各国及希、土两国反动派之用。参院外委会主席将于二十八日开始讨论北大西洋公约，然后即讨论“全面军事援助法案”。这个法案是马歇尔计划的一个重要补充，也是北大西洋公约侵略性质的有力注脚。
