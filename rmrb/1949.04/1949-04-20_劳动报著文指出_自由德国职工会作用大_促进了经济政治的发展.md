　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 18th: Moscow dispatch: The Soviet Labor News wrote: The Free German Trade Union Federation in the Soviet-occupied zone of Germany has been playing an increasingly important role in economic, political, and cultural development. The Free German Trade Union League is a powerful organization with five million members, representing most of the workers and staff in the Soviet-occupied zone and Berlin. The Free German Trade Union League thoroughly studies the rich experience of the Soviet trade unions and uses this experience to guide its activities. The trade unions in the Soviet-occupied zone are concentrating their efforts on completing the 1949-1950 economic development plan. This plan stipulates that industrial production will be increased by 35 percent compared to 1947, and the total amount of wages will be increased by 15 percent. The Soviet-occupied zone has implemented the principle of "equal pay for equal work," eliminating the terrible disenfranchised status of millions of women. However, in the Western German occupied zones, women's wages at most only reach 70 or 75 percent of men's wages. The elimination of unemployment in the Soviet-occupied zone is of the greatest benefit to the working people, while in West Germany there are more than 1.2 million unemployed workers. The Free German Trade Union League has been unremittingly fighting for the unity of the German trade union movement. Despite the prohibition of the West German trade union leaders and various obstructions from the Allied occupation authorities, the meeting held by the Miners' Union of the Soviet-occupied zone in Halle on January 10th was still attended by representatives of miners from the Ruhr and Rhine regions. The laboring people of the Soviet-occupied zone and East Berlin warmly welcome the decision of the World Federation of Trade Unions to allow the Free German Trade Union to participate. In the decision of the World Federation of Trade Unions, millions of organized German workers not only see the trust and friendship shown by the workers of the world, but they also understand that establishing close organizational ties with the international labor movement within the World Federation of Trade Unions will facilitate the German trade unions' efforts to strive for the unity of the German workers' movement, establish a unified democratic Germany, and safeguard the cause of peace.

　　劳动报著文指出
  　自由德国职工会作用大
  　促进了经济政治的发展
    【新华社北平十八日电】莫斯科讯：苏联劳动报写道：德国苏占区的自由德国职工会联合会，已在经济政治文化发展中起着日益重要的作用。自由德国职工会联盟是一个强有力的组织，有五百万会员，代表苏占区与柏林的大部分的工人与职员，自由德国职工会联盟彻底研究苏联职工会的丰富经验，以这一经验指导它的活动。苏占区职工会集中它的力量完成一九四九年至一九五零年的经济发展计划。这一计划规定将工业生产较一九四七年提高百分之三十五，薪资总数增加百分之十五。苏占区实施了“同工同酬”的原则，消灭了数百万妇女的恶劣的无权利地位，但是西德联占区中妇女的工资，最多却只达男子工资的百分之七十或七十五。在苏占区失业的消灭，对劳动人民有最大的利益，而西德则有一百二十万以上失业工人。自由德国职工会联盟坚持不懈地为德国职工运动的统一而斗争。尽管有西德职工会领袖的禁止以及联合占领区当局的各种阻挠，苏占区矿工联盟一月十日在哈尔所召开的会议，仍有鲁尔和莱茵区的矿工代表参加。苏占区和柏林东区的劳动人民热情地欢迎世界职工联盟允许自由德国职工会参加的决定。数百万有组织的德国工人，在世界工联的决定中，不只看到了全世界工人方面所表现的信任和友谊，他们更了解，在世界职工联盟中建立与国际劳工运动之间密切的组织上的联系，将便利德国职工会争取德国工人运动的团结，建立统一的民主德国与维护和平的事业。
