　　Liberated Area People's Support Army Marches Southward
    1,800 Kilometers of Railways Repaired
  　Trains Reach from Northeast to Central Plains
    [This newspaper dispatch] Reporter Chen Yongjin reports: Amidst the high tide of the Southern Advance Army liberating all of China, the people of the liberated areas have overcome difficulties and rushed to repair more than 1,800 kilometers of railways. Trains now run from the Northeast to the Central Plains, with workers, farmers, and soldiers from all areas supporting the front lines with boundless enthusiasm. Since last September, the commanders, fighters, engineers, and technicians of the Railway Corps of the Military Commission's Railway Department have completed the repair of 1,068 kilometers of the Changbin, Sichang, Shenji, Dazheng, Xinyi, Jichang, Gaoxin, Jingu, Beining, and the Beining section within the customs, and the northern section of the Jinpu Railway by the end of March this year. This included 126 bridges and 183 small culverts. In the construction of the railway, they fully demonstrated their noble labor enthusiasm. An 800-jin rail, which superiors stipulated should be carried by eight people, was carried by soldiers using six or even four people. Sleepers, which were supposed to be carried by two people, were carried away by soldiers alone, and some even carried two or three (referring to dry sleepers). Since the liberation of Shijiazhuang, the Shijiazhuang Railway Bureau has rushed to repair 155 kilometers of railway, with workers going into the cold river water in February to pull out the rails that had been hidden in the past. Employees of the Jinan Railway Bureau, in coordination with the broad masses of farmers in East China (since the liberation of Jinan), have repaired 321 kilometers, enabling the Jinpu Railway to quickly open to traffic from Jinan to Xuzhou, and it has now crossed the Huai River (the Huai River railway bridge has not yet been repaired) to Mingguang in Bengbu. When repairing the 50-plus kilometers of railway from Yanzhou to Lincheng on the Jinpu Railway, an old engineer surnamed Song did not believe it could be completed, but when he saw countless farmers from the countryside sending sleepers to the railway with small carts, large carts, or by carrying them, he saw the power of the people and exclaimed in amazement, "Only the Communist Party can do this!" As a result, this railway was completed in less than a month. When the railway lacked spikes, Jining County alone organized more than 50 blacksmith shops, producing five to six thousand spikes a day. The Zhengzhou Railway Bureau has repaired 320 kilometers of railway and 70 large and small bridges. The Pinghan Railway south of Zhengzhou is now open to traffic to the north bank of the Luohe River in Yancheng. At present, railway employees and farmers along the railway are actively rushing to repair under the slogan "Fight to where, repair the railway to where."
    [Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 14th] The Tianjin-Jinan section of the Jinpu Railway was connected on March 24th. The Tianjin-Jinan section connection project was rushed to completion in just over two months by a certain detachment of the People's Liberation Army Railway Corps with the assistance of a vast number of workers and farmers. The connection project started in early February. After the start of construction, each squad, platoon, and company launched a competition, mutually guaranteeing no work delays. Many soldiers who did not have technical skills or whose skills were not good learned while working in the competition. Because most of the soldiers in the Second Company of the detachment were new, they used the method of apprenticeship in their work, so that everyone learned a skill. When the Second Company was repairing a section of railway on its own, the detachment's task was to repair 1.5 kilometers a day, but they repaired 4 kilometers in two days. After the connection was completed, the first direct train passed through the pine and cypress archway of "Victory Forward" at 1:00 pm on March 24th. The archway was marked with bright red characters: "The Jinpu Railway is open! Please let the army take the train south!"

　　解放区人民支援大军南下
    修筑铁路千八百公里
  　从东北到中原火车通达
    【本报讯】记者陈勇进报导：解放区各地人民在南进大军解放全中国的高潮中，排除困难已抢修铁路一千八百余公里。从东北到中原火车通达，各地工人农民以及战士，以无比的热情支援前线；军委铁道部铁道纵队的指战员及工程师、技术工友们，自去年九月以来，将东北的长滨、四长、沈吉、大郑、新义、吉长、高辛、锦古、北宁与关内的北宁段，津浦北段等铁路共一千零六十八公里于今年三月底抢修完备，并有桥梁一百二十六处，小涵洞一百八十三处。在修筑铁路中充分的表现了他们崇高的劳动热忱，一条八百斤的铁轨，上级规定八个人抬，战士们用六个人或者用四个人，枕木规定两个人扛，战士们却一个人扛走，甚至更有的人扛两个或者三个（系干的枕木）。石家庄铁路局，自石家庄解放后已抢修铁路一百五十五公里，工人们二月里就下到水冷的河水里去拉出过去藏的铁轨。济南铁路局员工，在华东广大农民配合下（从济南解放后）已修复了三百二十一公里，使津浦路很快的从济南到徐州通了车，现已穿过了淮河（淮河铁桥尚未修复）到蚌埠的明光。当修筑津浦路从兖州到临城五十多公里的铁路时，一个姓宋的过去的老工程师不相信能完成，但当他看到无数的农民从乡村中把枕木用小车、大车或抬着送到铁路上的时候他才看到人民的力量，而十分惊奇的赞羡说：“只有共产党才能这样作呀！”结果这条铁路不到一月的时间就修成了。当铁路上缺乏道钉的时候，只济宁县一个地方就组织了五十多个铁匠炉，一天打出五六千道钉。郑州铁路局已修复铁路三百二十公里，大小桥七十座。郑州以南平汉路现已通车至螺河北岸郾城。现各地铁路员工及铁道沿线的农民正在“打到那里把铁路修到那里”的口号下积极抢修中。
    【新华社天津十四日电】津浦铁路津济（南）段已于三月二十四日接轨。津济段接轨工程系人民解放军铁道纵队某大队在广大工人和农民的协助下，以两个多月的时间抢修完成。接轨工程于二月初开工。该队各班、排以及连队之间在开工后即展开竞赛，互相保证不误工。许多不会技术或技术不好的战士，在竞赛中一面工作，一面学习。该队二中队因战士大部是新手，在工作中便用带徒弟的办法，使每个人都学会了一种技术。二中队在单独抢修一段铁路时，大队给的任务是一天修一公里半，他们却两天就修了四公里。接轨完成后，首次直达列车于三月二十四日下午一时穿过“胜利前进”的松柏牌坊，牌坊上标着鲜红大字：“津浦路修通了！请大军乘火车南下！”
