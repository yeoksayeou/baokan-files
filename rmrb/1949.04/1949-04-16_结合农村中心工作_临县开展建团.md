Xinhua News Agency, Xing County, 15th. Since Lin County in northwestern Shanxi Province began establishing the Communist Youth League in May of last year, it has developed more than 1,900 League members, established 37 branches and 241 groups. These League members are distributed in 224 natural villages and play an active role in various rural tasks. The Lin County Communist Party Committee has attached great importance to the work of building the League from the beginning. The County Committee has successively held three meetings of youth cadres. The County Committee Secretary personally participated in discussions on League building and used various meetings to conduct widespread propaganda and education on League building among cadres throughout the county. In addition, the County Committee transferred two Communist Party District Committee Secretaries and established a County Youth Work Committee, absorbing the County Youth League Secretary into the Communist Party County Committee, and five District Youth League Secretaries into the Communist Party District Committee. Currently, the county and district levels throughout the county are equipped with 28 youth work cadres. Lin County's League building work is carried out in conjunction with the current central tasks. Last autumn, the county proposed that League building was a part of party rectification work. Anjiazhuang, starting with party rectification, mobilized youth activists to participate in the party rectification activist meetings, carried out education on party rectification and League building, and held a village-wide youth conference to promote League building. In more than 40 days, the village developed 92 League members in the work of party rectification, autumn harvest, land tilling, distribution of struggle fruits, and consolidation of militia. When Yantou Village organized the militia core company, among the six League members, except for one with a disability, five League members were the first to sign up to participate. Among the 40 members of the core company in the entire administrative village, 20 were Communist Youth League members. In the work of supporting the front lines, League members can generally play a leading role. With the help of Party branches, the Communist Youth League also conducts regular studies to continuously improve itself. In order to further consolidate and develop the work of building the League, Lin County is about to gather the League branch secretaries of various villages and outstanding young Party members in villages that have not yet established the League for training, to cultivate more League backbone members.

　　结合农村中心工作
  　临县开展建团
    【新华社兴县十五日电】山西西北部的临县，自从去年五月开始建立青年团以来，已发展了一千九百多个团员，建立了三十七个支部、二百四十一个小组。这些团员分布在二百二十四个自然村里，在农村各项工作中起着积极的作用。该县中共县委一开始就很重视建团工作。县委曾先后召开过三次青年干部会议，县委书记亲自参加讨论建团工作，并利用各种会议对全县干部普遍进行了建团的宣传教育；此外，县委抽调了两个中共区委书记，成立县青年工作委员会，吸收县青委书记参加中共县委会，五个区的青委书记参加中共区委会。现全县县区一级已配备青年工作干部二十八人。临县建团工作是结合着当前中心工作进行的。去年秋天，该县提出建团是整党工作的一部分。安家庄从整党开始，即发动青年积极分子参加整党积极分子会，进行整党与建团的教育，并召开全村青年大会，宣传建团。四十多天中，该村在整党及秋收、翻地、分配斗争果实、整顿民兵等工作中，发展了九十二个团员，岩头村在组织民兵基干连时，六个团员中，除一个有残疾外，五个团员首先报名参加。全行政村基干连四十人中就有二十个是青年团员。在支援前线工作中，团员一般都能起带头作用。在党的支部帮助下，青年团并进行经常的学习不断地提高自己。为使建团工作得到进一步的巩固与发展，临县即将调集各村团的支部书记和尚未建团的村庄里的优秀青年党员加以训练，培养更多的团的骨干。
