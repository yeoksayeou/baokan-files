　　Awarding National Literary and Artistic Works
　　Decision of the Preparatory Committee for the Congress of Literary and Art Workers
　　[Our Newspaper] The Preparatory Committee for the All-China Congress of Literary and Art Workers held its second meeting yesterday (the 6th), determining the organizational structure and methods for selecting representatives, and discussing the preparatory work for the congress. The Preparatory Committee decided to evaluate literary and artistic works from the past five years in the Liberated Areas and the Kuomintang-controlled areas at the time of the congress. A "Literary and Artistic Works Evaluation Committee" was established to complete the preliminary selection of works. When the representative congress convenes, another award committee will be formed to conduct the second round of selection, and the final selections must be approved by the representative congress. The evaluation criteria will be a combination of expert standards and mass standards. The form of awards will be, in principle, divided into individual awards and group awards, with bonuses, certificates, and banners awarded accordingly. The Literary and Artistic Works Evaluation Committee will be divided into groups for novels (including essays and reports), poetry, music and drama, fine arts, and music.
　　[Another Report] The North China Literary and Art Circles Association and the North China Cultural and Art Work Committee jointly hosted a reception on the 6th for literary and art workers newly arrived in Beiping from Hong Kong and other places, including Ye Shengtao, Yang Hansheng, Hu Feng, Feng Naichao, Yu Ling, Shi Dongchuan, Zang Kejia, Bian Zhilin, Ding Cong, and Te Wei.
