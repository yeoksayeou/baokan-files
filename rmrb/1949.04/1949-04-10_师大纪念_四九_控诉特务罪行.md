　　Teachers College Commemorates "April 9th" Incident, Accuses Special Agents of Crimes

　　[Report from our newspaper] Over nine hundred teachers, students, and staff members of Teachers College, along with more than one hundred alumni in the revolutionary ranks, held a rally on the 9th to commemorate the "April 9th" bloodbath and protest the Nanjing "April 1st" massacre. Representatives from the All-China Student Federation, the Beiping Student Federation, and universities such as Peking University, Tsinghua University, and the Railway Institute also attended. At the meeting, students bitterly recounted the details of the bloodbath and denounced the crimes of the Kuomintang special agents. Mr. Xu Yingchao, the fifty-year-old director of the Physical Education Department, who had been arrested on November 14th, leaned on his cane and, pointing to his wobbling leg and dozens of burn scars on his chest and hands, said indignantly: "Look, this is what the Kuomintang special agents did to me. I fainted six times because of this." The assembly unanimously demanded that the People's Liberation Army swiftly cross the Yangtze River and capture the war criminals alive. It called on deceived students to quickly turn over a new leaf. Two students who had been deceived by special agents confessed publicly on the spot, admitted their mistakes, and exposed the crimes of the Kuomintang special agent organs in buying them off and instructing them to kill their own classmates.

　　师大纪念“四九”
  　控诉特务罪行
    【本报讯】师大师生员工九百余人及在革命队伍中的校友百余人，九日举行纪念“四九”血案与抗议南京“四一”惨案大会。全国学联、北平学联及北大、清华、铁院等校亦派代表参加。会上同学们痛陈血案经过，并控诉国民党特务罪行。十一月十四日曾被捕过的五十余岁之体育系主任徐英超先生，支着拐杖，指着一颠一颠的腿和胸前与手上数十处火烙的伤痕激愤地说：“请看，这就是国民党特务给我的，我曾因此昏过去六次。”大会一致要求人民解放军迅速渡过长江，活捉战犯。号召被骗的同学赶快自新。当场有两个曾被特务欺骗的同学当众坦白，承认错误，揭发了国民党特务机关收买他们，指使他们残杀自己同学的罪行。
