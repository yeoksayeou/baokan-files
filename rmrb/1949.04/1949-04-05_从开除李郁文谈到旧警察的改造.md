　　From the Expulsion of Li Yuwen to the Transformation of Old Police Officers
　　仲
　　On March 27th, the Seventh Precinct of the Beiping Public Security Bureau expelled a corrupt police officer. The incident unfolded as follows: At 12:00 AM on March 15th, Third-Class Police Officer Li Yuwen of the Tenth Police Station abandoned his post and, together with Third-Class Police Officer Zhu Zhilian, went to the Donglaishun Hotel in Qianmenli to drink. After finishing their drinks, it was already 1:00 AM. Drunk, they not only refused to pay, but also barged into the room of a female traveler, Wang Shuqin, to harass her and attempt rape. After the Donglaishun staff member Liu Baichuan reported the incident, the Seventh Precinct investigated and confirmed the facts, detaining Li Yuwen for two days before expelling him. Zhu Zhilian was detained for two days and kept under observation at the station.

　　During the Kuomintang rule, Li Yuwen had been a local tyrant in his jurisdiction, making it a common occurrence to take things without paying. Back then, who among the small business owners dared to provoke such an accomplice of evil! After liberation, the people who had been oppressed for years could no longer bear it. A few days ago, when the Seventh Precinct went to the Qianmenli Qipan Street area to investigate Li Yuwen's past crimes, Ni Ji Restaurant, Liu Ji Restaurant, and Li Chunshan, who runs a cigarette stall, all said in unison: "There's no need to mention it! In the past, he would buy things, eat meals, and not pay, even glaring at you. Sometimes, if he had money, he would only pay half. It was always like that. Anyway, he (referring to Li Yuwen) never paid, so we didn't bother keeping records. How much he owed us is simply unclear."

　　Of the 10,000 police officers in Beiping in the past, those as bad as Li Yuwen were not a minority. According to residents, at that time, their superiors not only didn't care but also used many methods to encourage the police to do this! Because if the police didn't do this, the police officials wouldn't be able to make money. They said that at that time, to become a police chief, one had to bribe inspectors and bureau members, and inspectors had to bribe branch chiefs, otherwise they would be dismissed or suppressed. The police's salary was not enough for their own living expenses, so where would they get the money to bribe their superiors? They could only take it from merchants and residents.

　　A police officer told a reporter a very common and ordinary story: A bureau member's bicycle tire was damaged and needed to be replaced. He called the police chief of the police station in his jurisdiction that sold tires and had him buy a bicycle tire. The police chief went to the tire shop to "buy" it, took a tire, and casually asked, "How much does one cost?" Did the shop dare to ask for money? They could only say, "Take one and use it!" If they asked for money, they wouldn't be able to do business tomorrow. The police chief gave the tire to the bureau member, and the bureau member also pretended to ask, "How much does it cost?" The police chief could only smile and say, "You don't have to worry about it." Really ask for money? The police chief wouldn't be a police chief tomorrow.

　　After the liberation of Beiping, corrupt police officials were eliminated, and new cadres were replaced. Under correct leadership, the police have gradually turned away from evil and embraced the path of serving the people in the past two months. Police scum like Li Yuwen, who persisted in their old evils, have been successively expelled and eliminated, and are gradually becoming fewer. A dozen days ago, an incident occurred in the East City where police officers forced residents and shops to buy inferior cigarettes. If this extortionate behavior is not corrected, Li Yuwen is a warning from the past.

　　Times have changed. It is hoped that police officers or other public officials who have been tainted with the bad habits of the old society will quickly transform themselves and reform themselves so as not to be abandoned by the times. As Yu Wenying, the police chief of the Seventh Precinct, said, in the past, money and gifts could buy discipline, and the law was completely ineffective; now, officials only recognize reason and not money. The old ways are no longer working. Whoever still wants to extort, blackmail, or oppress the people deserves their own misfortune!

　　从开除李郁文谈到旧警察的改造
    仲
    北平公安局内七分局三月二十七日开除了一个作恶的警察。这件事的经过是这样：第十派出所三等警士李郁文，在三月十五日夜十二时值勤的时候，擅离职守，偕同三等警士朱之廉，到前门里的东来顺旅店饮酒，喝完后已深夜一时，醉熏熏地，不但不给钱，反跑进女旅客王淑琴的住房里调戏王女，并企图行奸。事经东来顺伙友刘百川告发，内七分局调查属实，将李郁文禁闭两日后开除，朱之廉禁闭二日，留所看查。
    在国民党统治时期，李郁文在所管辖的地段横行霸道，买东西不给钱是常事。那时候，作小买卖的谁敢惹这类为虎作伥的腿子！解放了，经年被压迫的人再也忍不住了，前几天，内七分局到前门里棋盘街一带调查李郁文过去的罪恶时，倪记酒饭铺、刘记饭铺，还有摆烟摊的李春山等等，都异口同声的说：“就不用提啦！过去买东西，吃饭，不给钱还瞪眼，有时候有钱，也只给一半。经常是这样，反正他（指李郁文）也不给钱，我们也不记帐，费那事干什么？究竟欠我们多少钱，简直闹不清”。
    过去北平全市一万名警察中，象李郁文这样坏的并非少数。据居民说，那时候，他们的头目，不仅是不管，还用许多办法来鼓励警察们这样做呢！因为警察们要不这样做，当警官的也就无财可发了。他们说，那时候当一名警长要给巡官、局员送礼，巡官要给分局长送礼，否则不是开除，就要受制。警察的薪水，自己尚不够维生，那来钱给上司送礼？只有取之于商民了。
    一个警士对记者说了一件很普通很平常的事：一个局员的自行车带坏了，需要换新的，他就把辖区内有卖带子的派出所警长叫了来，让他买自行车带去。警长跑到车带铺去“买”，拿了带子随便一问“多少钱一条”；铺子里敢要钱吗？只有说：“您拿一条用吧！”要钱，明天买卖就不用作了。警长给局员送了带子去，局员也假装着问：“多少钱”？警长只有含笑说：“您不用管啦”，真要钱？明天警长就不用当啦。
    北平解放，贪污腐化的警官淘汰了，换上了新的干部。警察们在正确领导下，两个月来，已逐渐改邪归正，走向了为人民服务的大道。象李郁文这种坚持旧恶的警界败类，则陆续被开除淘汰，逐渐很少了。十几天前东城曾经发生过警察到住户商店强卖劣等纸烟的事情，这种敲诈行为如仍不改，李郁文就是前车之鉴。
    时代变了，希望曾经染有旧社会恶习的警察或其他公务人员迅速转变自己，改造自己，使不为时代所抛弃。正如内七分局警长于文英所说，过去用金钱礼物可以买纪律，法律根本不发生效力；现在当官的只认理不认钱了，旧的那一套吃不开了，谁要还想勒索敲诈，欺压人民，就活该他自己倒霉！
