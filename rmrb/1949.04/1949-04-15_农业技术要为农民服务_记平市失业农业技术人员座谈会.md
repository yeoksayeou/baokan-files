Agricultural Technology Must Serve Farmers
　　A Record of the Symposium for Unemployed Agricultural Technicians in Ping City

　　The symposium for unemployed agricultural technicians, sponsored by the Agricultural Department of the North China People's Government in late March, was attended by 413 people. They graduated or studied at 138 schools at home and abroad, with the most coming from the Agricultural College of Peking University, the China Agricultural Training Class, the Northeast, and those who studied in Japan. Among these people, some had been unemployed for a long time, some became unemployed immediately after graduation, and some had to change careers. They all had varying degrees of dissatisfaction with the old society and expectations for the people's government.

　　The symposium started on March 22nd and ended on the 28th. During the meeting, four slogans were the main content of the study: "Transform the consuming city into a productive city," "Only under the New Democratic regime can we give full play to our strengths," "Increase agricultural production by one inch on the existing foundation," and "Establish the idea of serving the people." During this period, the Deputy Minister of Agriculture made two reports, followed by group discussions and individual talks. Attendees had preliminary changes in understanding, which can be summarized as follows:

　　Some people, having been deceived by the Kuomintang's registration-only-no-employment policy after the Japanese surrender, came to register this time with a skeptical attitude. However, after understanding the government's agricultural production plan guidelines and practices for 1949 and seeing the hard-working and pragmatic style of the people's government cadres, their doubts gradually disappeared, and they believed that the government would assign appropriate work.

　　Some feared the hardship of the countryside and were unwilling to leave their homes or leave Tianjin. The Deputy Minister explained to them: Agricultural production cannot be carried out in the city; if cattle plague occurs somewhere, we must never drive all the sick cattle into Beijing for treatment. Similarly, it is impossible to transport pests to Beijing to kill them. Technicians must go to the countryside to make a career. Closing the door for experiments and research that are divorced from reality will not contribute or help farmers. After understanding this principle, some who insisted on staying in Tianjin were willing to go to the countryside.

　　Some feared that the supply system could not support their families and were concerned about the amount of their monthly salary. Through group discussions and individual talks, they began to see the prospects for the development of science and technology under the leadership of the democratic government, and automatically lowered their demands. A Mr. Li said: "I feel very ashamed to talk about treatment now: how to integrate with the peasants is a more important issue than treatment!"

　　Some doubted that the government did not value science and technology personnel. After several days of discussions, they realized that only under the leadership of the people's government can science and technology develop, and technicians can give full play to their personal strengths.

　　However, there were also a few individuals who stubbornly emphasized personal treatment, had no concept of serving the people, and stubbornly said: "Simply, without discount, four hundred catties of rice!" This statement has been criticized.

　　Before the end of the meeting, the Ministry of Agriculture, according to the needs of various regions, formulated a plan for assigning work. On the last day, individual talks were conducted, considering each person's requirements and aspirations, and based on the principle of employing people according to their talents, the work of more than 300 people has been determined.

### 农业技术要为农民服务　记平市失业农业技术人员座谈会

　　农业技术要为农民服务
  　记平市失业农业技术人员座谈会
    华北人民政府农业部三月下旬主办的失业农业技术人员座谈会，出席四百一十三人。他们分别在国内外一百三十八个学校毕业或肄业，其中以北大农学院，华农训练班，东北的，留学日本的占数最多。这些人中，有的失业已久，有的才毕业就失业，有的不得已改了行。他们对旧社会都有不同程度的不满，对人民政权怀着期望。
    座谈会从三月二十二日开始，于二十八日结束，会议中，“把消费城市变成生产城市”，“只有在新民主主义政权下才能发挥我们的所长”，“在现有基础上把农业生产提高一寸”，“树立为人民服务的思想”等四个口号是学习的主要内容。这期间，农业部副部长作了两次报告，接着进行了小组讨论和个别谈话，与会者在认识上都有了初步的变化，总括起来，有下列几种情况
    有的人由于在日本投降后受了国民党只登记不录用的欺骗，这回便怀着半信半疑态度来登记。及至了解了政府一九四九年的农业生产计划方针和作法，看到人民政府干部的艰苦切实作风之后，疑虑渐消，相信政府一定会分配适当工作。
    有的怕农村苦，不愿离开家，离开平津。副部长向他们解释：农业生产不可能搬入都市来进行；假如某地发生了牛瘟，我们绝不能把病牛都赶进北平来治，同样，也不可能把害虫运到北平来杀死。技术人员必须下乡，才能做出事业来。关上门作脱离现实的试验研究，是不会对农民有什么贡献与帮助的。经了解这个道理之后，一些坚持不离平津的，也肯到农村去了。
    有的怕实行供给制不能养家，斤斤于月薪的多寡。经过小组讨论与个别谈话，他们开始看到了在民主政府领导下科学技术发展的远景，自动把提出的要求降低下来。有一位李先生说：“现在让我谈待遇问题，我觉得非常惭愧：怎样和农民打成一片，是比待遇还重要的问题呀！”
    有的怀疑政府对科学和技术人员不重视，经过几天的座谈，他们了解到惟有在人民政府领导下科学技术才能发展，技术人员才能发挥个人所长。
    但也有个别人固执的强调个人待遇，丝毫没有为人民服务的观点，顽固的说：“干脆，不折不扣四百斤米！”这种说法已受到批判。
    会议结束前，农业部根据各地区的需要，订出了分配工作的计划，经于最后一日进行个别谈话，考虑了每个人的要求与志趣，并根据量才录用的原则，已确定了三百多人的工作。　　　　　（韩占忠）
