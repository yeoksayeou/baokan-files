　　First Engineering Team of Changxindian Road Construction Office
  　Launches Spike-Driving Competition to Rush Repair the Pinghan North Section
    [Ping City News] The First Engineering Team of the Changxindian Road Construction Office, during the emergency repair project of the Pingbao section of the Pinghan Railway, launched a spike-driving competition. Except for personnel, cooks, and some military cadres who were unable to participate, everyone else joined the work. During the rush repair, the captain, supervisor, all cadres, and guards all participated in carrying the sleepers. Drivers, stokers, and conductors also sometimes helped out. In the past, the engineering team had a total of 280 participants, using entirely American sleepers, each weighing less than 100 jin. Eleven sleepers were laid every ten meters, and they could only spike 1.5 kilometers per day. Now, with only 185 people, they lay 16 to 17 sleepers every ten meters. The lightest sleeper weighs 150 jin, and the heaviest weighs up to 300 jin. However, they can now spike 1.933 kilometers of track per day, averaging 10.4 meters of track spiked per person per day, creating a new record for spike-driving.

　　长辛店筑路处第一工程队
  　展开钉道竞赛　抢修平汉北段
    【平市讯】长辛店筑路处第一工程队在抢修平汉路平保段工程中，展开钉道竞赛，除配备人员、炊事员及一部分部队干部未能参加外，其余都加入工作。抢修时，队长、监工、各干部、警卫队员均参加扛枕木。司机、司炉及车长有时也都下手帮忙。该工程队过去参加工作人数共二百八十人，完全使用美国枕木，每根不足一百斤重，每十米铺枕木十一根，每天仅钉一公里半。现在只一百八十五人，每十米铺枕木十六到十七根，每根枕木最轻者也有一百五十斤，最重的有到三百斤者，可是每天钉道竟达一、九三三公里，平均每人每日钉道一○·四公尺，创造了钉道的新纪录。
