[JiluYu Electric Dispatch] The people of Kunshan have suffered from enemy destruction for years and the floods of last year, making their lives extremely impoverished this year. Before the dyke restoration began, the government and the Kunshan Flood Control Section decided to adopt a work-relief contracting method. Based on the principle of voluntary participation, the workers selected their own foremen, and each cubic meter of earthwork was compensated with two catties of rice and two catties of firewood. More work meant more rice, and any losses or gains were not the village's concern. A large number of people rushed to contract work. This not only guaranteed the completion of the task of over 120,000 cubic meters of earthwork in Kunshan but also provided a way for the people of Kunshan, who were severely affected by the famine, to overcome the difficulties through self-help. It started on March 30, and 1,556 people have already begun work. In Chengge Village, each worker completes 3.5 cubic meters per day. If each person’s daily life is calculated at 2.5 catties of grain, the wages earned can still save half or one-third.

　　崐山以工代赈动工复堤
    【冀鲁豫电】崐山群众由于连年遭敌摧残和去年的水灾，今年生活极端贫困，复堤开始前，政府及崐山修防段，即决定采取以工代赈的包工办法，在自愿结合的原则下，自选工头，每方土发给二斤米二斤柴，多挖了多挣米，赔赚与村无关。大批群众争先包工，这样不仅使崐山完成十二万余方土的任务有了保证，且对灾荒较严重的崐山群众以渡荒自救的出路。于三月三十日开始，已有一千五百五十六人开始动工。成阁村每天每工合三方五分，每人每天生活按二斤半粮计算，所挣工资，尚可节余一半或三分之一。
