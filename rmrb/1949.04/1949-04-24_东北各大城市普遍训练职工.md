Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 22nd. Recently, major northeastern cities, including Shenyang, Harbin, Changchun, Jilin, Jiamusi, Qiqihar, Siping, Mudanjiang, Andong, Jinzhou, and Chengde, have universally established worker training classes and night schools. In Shenyang, in addition to the Northeast Worker Political University and four larger training classes, there is also a worker literature and art training class jointly run by the Industrial Department of the Northeast Administrative Committee and the Lu Xun Academy of Art, and two worker short-term literature and art training classes jointly run by the Preparatory Committee of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions and the Northeast Literature and Art Association. There is also a party newspaper worker correspondence work school run by the Preparatory Committee of the Railway Workers' General Union, with a total of more than 400 students. Worker night schools and training classes in Harbin are all over the streets, with more than 10,000 workers regularly attending classes. There are also more than 40 worker night schools in Qiqihar, with more than 2,000 students. The Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China in Jiamusi, the Municipal Government, and various schools have sent personnel to factories to assist in cultural education. In the past few months, the night schools and training classes in the above-mentioned areas have achieved considerable results in improving the general political and cultural level of workers, but the most basic content of worker education, namely class and class struggle, labor creating the world, the bourgeoisie exploiting surplus value, what is the Communist Party, what is internationalism, etc., has not received enough attention. This is now beginning to attract attention.

　　东北各大城市普遍训练职工
    【新华社沈阳二十二日电】东北各大城市沈阳、哈尔滨、长春、吉林、佳木斯、齐齐哈尔、四平、牡丹江、安东、锦州、承德等，最近已普遍开办了工人训练班及夜校。沈阳市除东北工人政治大学及四个较大的训练班外，还有东北行政委员会工业部与鲁迅艺术学院合办的工人文艺训练班一处，市职工总会筹委会与东北文艺协会合办的工人短期文艺训练班两处，另有铁路职工总会筹委会办的党报工人通讯工作学校一处，共有学员四百余名。哈尔滨市工人夜校及训练班遍及各街区，经常上学的工人达万人以上。齐齐哈尔市职工夜校亦有四十余处，学员二千余人，佳木斯市中共市委会、市政府及各学校分别派员至工厂帮助文化教育。上述各地夜校及训练班。在过去数月中对提高职工一般政治文化水平上已获得不少成绩，但对职工教育中最基本的内容，即阶级与阶级斗争，劳动创造世界，资产阶级剥削剩余价值以及什么是共产党、什么是国际主义等等，都注意得不够。现在正开始引起注意。
