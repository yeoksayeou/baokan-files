【Taihang Electric】 Workers at the Wuan Yihua Weaving Factory, under the Taihang Industrial Company, worked day and night to complete the task of rushing to produce mosquito net cloth for the cadres heading south. After receiving the task on March 15th to produce 700 bolts of mosquito net cloth for the cadres heading south within fifteen days, all the workers in the machine weaving department, encouraged by the victorious situation, actively rushed to produce them. To this end, they sacrificed their holidays and worked ten extra night shifts, victoriously completing the plan on schedule at the end of March, exceeding it by 99 bolts. During this shock task, many model workers and activists emerged. In order to commend these activists and promote future work, the factory leadership held a commendation and award meeting on April 1st. Li Peichen, an old worker who was selected as a first-class model, unreservedly taught everyone the technique of weaving twisted silk mosquito net cloth during this shock work, which improved everyone's skills. He said at the commendation meeting: "It is wrong for us to be secretive about techniques when working in our own factory. We must be able to teach our techniques to everyone, so that we will be honored and everyone will be honored, and the contribution to the revolution will be greater." Zhao Chengtin, Jiao Chengji, Guo Longquan and others all worked while ill. The leadership asked them to rest or transfer to some lighter work, but they all declined the leadership's care and continued to add night shifts to rush production for days.

【Jidong Electric】 Cadres from all parts of the Jidong District are enthusiastically responding to the Party's call and are heading south one after another. At present, nearly 3,000 people heading south have gathered at the district party committee organs and formed the "Jidong District Southward Work Group." They have made preparations and are seizing the opportunity to study before their departure.

【Another Electric】 The Jidong District Women's Federation saw off the Jidong District Southward Work Group and proposed: 1. Assist the comrades in the nursery to set up the nursery as soon as possible and try to make it as good as possible. 2. Guarantee that the children of the cadres heading south who are left behind in the counties and villages will receive their benefits and care on time. 3. Mobilize women's federation cadres at all levels and women to take care of the military and cadre dependents heading south and help solve their difficulties.

【Taihang Electric】 In welcoming the army heading south, the Anyang County United Cooperative organized a temporary sales station. The county United Cooperative assigned three cadres and one district cadre to supply the army with necessities. The method is: the village governments of the border villages organize the disaster victims, who are introduced by the district office, to get soy sauce, vinegar, eggs, cigarettes, pears and other goods on credit from the cooperative, and go to the villages where the troops are stationed to sell them on the move. Prices are uniformly stipulated in advance to ensure that the vendors get a certain profit and are not allowed to raise prices arbitrarily, and the price of the goods is returned within the agreed time limit. Since the 15th of last month, the sales station has organized 25 mobile sales teams, each with three to five people, organizing 114 farmers, and sold 48,708 yuan worth of goods in the villages where the troops were stationed in five days. This not only provided the troops with necessities of life, reduced the intermediate exploitation of merchants, but also solved some of the difficulties for the disaster victims.

　　积极支援大军南下
  　益华厂加工制蚊帐
    冀东妇联会决努力帮助军干属
    南下道上安阳设售物站
  　冀东三千干部待命南下
    【太行电】太行实业公司所属武安益华织布厂工人，日以继夜的完成了给南下干部赶制蚊帐布的任务。三月十五日该厂接受了给南下干部在十五日内赶制七百匹蚊帐布的任务后，机织部全体工人，在胜利形势的鼓舞下，积极赶制，为此，他们牺牲了礼拜，连加十个夜工，于三月底胜利地按期完成计划，并且超过了九十九匹。在这一突击任务中，涌现出不少模范工人与积极分子。厂领导上为了表扬这些积极分子，推动今后工作，特于四月一日召开了表功嘉奖大会。被选为头等模范的老工人李培臣在这次突击工作中，毫不保守地把会织绞丝蚊帐布的技术教给大家，使大家技术提高了一步。他在表功会上说：“我们在自己的工厂做活，保守技术是不对的，要能把自己的技术教给大家，自己光荣大家也光荣，对革命的贡献也大。”赵成廷、焦成吉、郭龙全等都是带病工作，领导上让他们休息或调动一些轻闲工作，但他们均谢绝了领导上的照顾，仍然连日增加夜工突击生产。
    【冀东电】冀东区各地干部，热烈响应党的号召，纷纷南下。目前近三千名的南下人员已齐集区党委机关，组成“冀东区南下工作团”，他们已做好准备工作，并抓紧行前时机学习。
    【又电】冀东区妇联会欢送冀东区南下工作团，提出：一、协助保育院同志尽快地把保育院办起来，并要尽量办得好。二、对南下干部们留在各县各村的孩子们，保证给按时领到待遇和照顾一切。三、动员各级妇联干部和妇女群众照顾南下军属干属，帮助解决困难。
    【太行电】在欢送南下大军中，安阳县联社组织了临时售货站，由县联社抽出三个干部与区干部一人，供给军队必需品。办法是：由边沿村村政府组织起灾民，经区署介绍，到合作社赊上酱、醋、鸡子、纸烟、梨等货物，到部队所在村庄，流动出卖。预先统一规定价格，使贩卖者获得一定利润，并不得任意涨价，在约定期限内归还货价。该售货站从上月十五日起，共组织了二十五个流动卖货小组，每组三、五人不等，组织了农民一百一十四人，五天内在部队驻村共卖洋四万八千七百零八元。这样不但使部队获得生活必需品，减少了商贩的中间剥削，并给灾民解决了部分困难。
