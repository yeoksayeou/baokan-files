　　What were the results of the Soviet Union's previous "Five-Year Plans"?
    Question: How many "Five-Year Plans" has the Soviet Union implemented? What were the purposes and results of each "Five-Year Plan"? Ye Molin
    Answer: The Soviet Union has already implemented three "Five-Year Plans," and the current "New Five-Year Plan" is the fourth "Five-Year Plan." The main contents of these four "Five-Year Plans" are as follows:

    From 1928 to 1932, was the period of the first "Five-Year Plan." Due to the enthusiasm of the Soviet working people in production, the task was completed in only four years and three months. The result of the completion of this Five-Year Plan: It transformed the Soviet Union from a backward agricultural country into an advanced industrial country. In terms of industry, capitalist elements were eliminated, and the kulak class in rural areas was also eliminated. There was no unemployment or poverty, and people's lives were guaranteed from then on. Heavy industry and the machinery industry were also established. Therefore, agriculture also developed accordingly. Within three years, more than 200,000 collective farms and 5,000 state farms were organized, and more than 60 percent of farmers joined collective farms. Collective farms and state farms cultivated two-thirds of the land in the Soviet Union, laying the foundation for the socialist economy.

    The Second Five-Year Plan, from 1933 to 1937, saw the elimination of all exploiting classes. Ninety-four percent of the residents, workers, staff, and collective farmers engaged in the socialist economy, completed the technical improvement of the entire national economy, increasing industrial output by 4.3 times compared to 1929, and agricultural output by 54 percent compared to the First Five-Year Plan. It reached the level stipulated for the final year of the plan in four years and three months. At the same time, the living standards of the workers were also greatly improved. Not only did the real wages of workers increase more than twofold, but the income of collective farmers also increased from 4.6 billion rubles to 14.2 billion rubles. Moreover, people's savings deposits also increased from 1 billion rubles to 4.5 billion rubles. Cultural construction also made great progress, with the number of students in senior schools reaching 550,000, and the number of university students exceeding the total number of university students in Germany, Britain, France, Italy, and Japan.

    After the Soviet Union completed the two Five-Year Plans, Soviet socialist industry ranked first in the world, but in terms of production volume per capita, it had not yet caught up with countries such as Britain and France. Therefore, the Third Five-Year Plan (from 1938 to 1942) saw the Soviet Union continue to develop heavy industry, accelerate the development of national economic sectors, to complete the construction of socialism and gradually transition socialist society to communist society.

    But in the third year of the plan, fascist Hitler launched a barbaric attack, destroying the peaceful construction of the Soviet Union. Even so, the Soviet Union had then completed the electrification of various industrial production processes, and agricultural output increased by 52 percent compared to the 30.5 billion rubles at the end of the Second Five-Year Plan. National consumption increased by 1.5 to 2 times. The number of students in Soviet universities and advanced technical schools reached as many as 650,000, and almost every worker's family's children received secondary education.

    After the victory of the Soviet Union's patriotic war of self-defense, a new "Five-Year Plan" (the Fourth "Five-Year Plan") was implemented. As determined by the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union: From 1946 to 1950, all the damages suffered by the Soviet Union would be restored, and industry and agriculture would also be restored to pre-war levels, and continued efforts would be made to surpass this level. It was also stipulated that industrial products should increase by 48 percent compared to 1940. Under the superior Soviet social and state system, the broad masses of workers and peasants displayed unparalleled enthusiasm for production and construction, and carried out enthusiastic revolutionary competition, all striving to complete the new "Five-Year Plan" in four years.

### 苏联历次实行“五年计划”的结果如何？

　　苏联历次实行“五年计划”的结果如何？
    问：苏联实行过几次“五年计划”？每个“五年计划”实行的目的和结果如何？  　 叶墨林
    答：苏联已经实行了三个“五年计划”，目前所实行的“新的五年计划”是第四次“五年计划”。这四次“五年计划”的主要内容是这样的：
    自一九二八年到一九三二年，是第一次“五年计划”的时期，由于苏联劳动人民生产的热情，仅四年零三个月就完成了任务。这次五年计划完成的结果：使苏联由落后的农业国变成了先进的工业国，在工业方面，消灭了资本主义成份，农村中的富农阶级也消灭了，没有了失业、贫困现象，人们的生活从此得到了保障，重工业与机械工业也建立起来。因此，农业随着也得到了发展，三年以内，组织了二十万以上的集体农庄和五千个国营农庄，百分之六十以上的农户参加了集体农庄。集体农场和国营农场耕种了全苏联的三分之二土地，替社会主义经济打下了基础。
    第二次五年计划从一九三三年到一九三七年一切剥削阶级都被消灭了，有百分之九十四的居民、从事于社会主义经济的工人、职员和集体农民，完成了全部国民经济的技术改进，使工业产品比一九二九年增加了四·三倍，农业出产量比第一次五年计划时增加百分之五十四。时历四年零三个月就达到计划最后一年所规定的水平。同时，劳动者的生活水平也大大的提高了，不但工人的实际工资增加到两倍以上，集体农民的收入也从四十六万万卢布增到一百四十二万万卢布，而且人民的储蓄存款也由过去的十万万卢布增到四十五万万卢布。文化建设方面也得到了飞跃进展，高级学校的学生达五十五万之多，而大学学生人数为德、英、法、意、日诸国大学生的总数。
    苏联完成了两个五年计划后，苏联社会主义的工业已占全世界第一位，但按苏联人口为标准的生产额来说，还没有赶上英、法等国，因此第三次五年计划（自一九三八年——一九四二年），苏联即继续发展重工业，加速发展国民经济部门，要完成社会主义的建设，使社会主义社会逐渐过渡到共产主义社会。
    但在计划的第三年，法西斯希特勒发动了野蛮的进攻，破坏了苏联的和平建设，即或如此，苏联在那时也已完成了各种工业生产过程的电汽化，农业出产量比第二次五年计划终结时的三百零五万万卢布增加了百分之五十二，国民消费额提高一倍半到两倍。苏联大学及高级技术学校学生人数达到了六十五万之多，几乎每个工人家庭的子女都得到了中等教育。
    苏联的爱国自卫战得到胜利后就实行新的“五年计划”（即第四次“五年计划”）。经苏联最高会议的确定：在一九四六年到一九五零年中，要将苏联所遭受的全部损害恢复起来，工农业也要恢复到战前水平，并继续努力超过这个水平。又规定工业产品比一九四零年增加百分之四十八。在优越的苏维埃社会与国家制度下，广大工人、农民发挥着无比的生产建设热情，进行热烈的革命竞赛，都争取新的“五年计划”四年完成。
