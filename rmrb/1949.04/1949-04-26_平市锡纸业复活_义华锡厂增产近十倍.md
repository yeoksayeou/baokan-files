　　Ping City Tin Foil Industry Revives
  　Yihua Tin Factory Increases Production Nearly Tenfold
    [Reported by this newspaper] Yihua is the only factory in Ping City that manufactures tin foil. Before liberation, cigarette factories relied on foreign tin foil, so the factory barely survived by producing tin foil for superstitious items. After liberation, cigarette factories resumed prosperity, while foreign tin foil disappeared. Consequently, the factory had an opportunity to develop. The annual output in 1947 was only 150,000 sheets. Last year, due to poor business, it was closed from February to August, and the product was almost nonexistent. After resuming production in March this year, the monthly output was 80,000 sheets. From April 1st to 25th, it has already produced 120,000 sheets, and the output is almost ten times that before liberation. It is estimated that after the cigarette factories in the city increase production in May, the monthly demand for tin foil will be 1.5 million sheets, so the future of the tin foil industry is very optimistic.

　　平市锡纸业复活
  　义华锡厂增产近十倍
    【本报讯】平市制造锡纸的工厂仅义华一家，因解放前各卷烟厂所用锡纸一向仰赖外国，故该厂仅能赖制造锡箔迷信品勉强维持。解放后，烟厂纷纷恢复繁荣，而外来锡纸却告绝迹，该厂遂获得发展的机会。一九四七年全年产量仅十五万张，去年因营业不振，从二月歇业到八月，产品几等于没有。今年三月恢复后，全月产八万张，四月份一日至二十五日已产十二万张，产量几达解放前十倍，预计五月份本市各烟厂增产后，每月需要锡纸一百五十万张，锡纸工业的前途故极乐观。（鸣）
