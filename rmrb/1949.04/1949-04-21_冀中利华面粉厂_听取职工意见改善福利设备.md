The state-owned Lihua Flour Mill, after leadership review, is paying more attention to employee welfare. Based on the opinions of all members of the employee union, the factory's Party, administration, labor union, and factory management committee discussed and decided on the following four items to be implemented: (1) In the past, workers in the boiler group, flour group, labor group, and repair group did not have work clothes. However, boiler group workers needed two sets of single-layer clothes to change during the winter, and flour group workers wore out one set of cotton clothes each winter. Many workers and trainees could not solve the clothing problem. Therefore, the factory decided to provide work clothes for workers in each group and stipulated a system for issuing new clothes in exchange for old ones. At the same time, workers should cherish their work clothes, often sew and wash them, and prevent the tendency of not valuing public property. (2) Further appropriately improve employee meals, especially night shift meals. (3) Last winter, all employees raised funds to establish a cotton ginning workshop, which was very profitable. In the future, it will be directly led by a dedicated person from the labor union, who will report accounts monthly to facilitate development. In order to expand the cooperative production of workers' savings, a brick kiln was also opened. Regarding employee health and insurance facilities, such as masks and bathhouses, equipment is being planned.

　　冀中利华面粉厂
  　听取职工意见改善福利设备
    【冀中电】国营利华面粉厂，经过检查领导，更进一步重视职工福利事业，根据职工会全体会员意见，由工厂党、行政、工会及工厂管理委员会讨论，已决定以下四项开始执行：（一）过去无论烧锅炉组、面粉组、劳动组、修理组的工人都没有工作服；但烧锅炉组工人，一冬就要两身单衣服来套换，面粉组工人一冬也要穿坏一身棉衣，好多工人和学员不能解决衣服问题。为此工厂决定给各组工人增添工作服，并规定领新交旧的领发制度。同时工人对工作服要爱护，经常缝洗。防止拿公家衣服不当事的偏向。（二）进一步适当改善职工伙食，特别是夜班伙食。（三）去冬全体职工集资办理的一个轧花作坊，盈利很大，以后直接由工会派专人领导，每月报帐一次，以利发展。为了扩大工人积蓄的合作生产，又开办砖窑一座。关于职工卫生、保险设备，如口罩、浴塘等正计划设备。
