All the representatives first welcomed Comrade Rao Shushi, member of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and Secretary of the East China Bureau, and Comrade Liu Xiao, alternate member of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, who attended the congress with long and enthusiastic applause. During the discussion, Comrade Xiao Hua from the People's Liberation Army delegation spoke first, stating that the establishment of the League in the army should resolutely implement Commander-in-Chief Zhu's instructions to make the League a powerful assistant to the political work of the troops. Comrade Wang Zhizhou from the Northwest delegation, based on the experience of the League's establishment in the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region, believed that the most important task of the rural Youth League was to strengthen the education of League members.

Subsequently, two combat heroes reported on their heroic deeds. Twenty-four-year-old combat hero Tian Guangwen recounted the battle of Baitun in the Jinzhou campaign, in which 37 soldiers repelled more than fifteen counterattacks by two regiments of the enemy, and finally completed their mission with all 37 soldiers safely returning to their team. The whole audience was moved. Hua Dong female combat hero Shi Zhenyu narrated her eighteen months of guerrilla warfare and ninety-two battles. The audience applauded thunderously.
　　Finally, the congress adopted the election methods and election schedule for the Central Committee members and alternate Central Committee members of the China New Democratic Youth League proposed by the Presidium.
