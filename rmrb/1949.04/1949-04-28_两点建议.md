To the Editor:
　　On the way from Shijiazhuang to Beiping, I saw some unreasonable phenomena and problems. Although they may only be temporary, they still need to be brought to the attention of the relevant authorities for improvement:
　　1. Lack of organization and management of private passenger and freight vehicles. At present, there are many private long-distance buses traveling between Ping and Shi. Due to decentralized operations and each going its own way, ticket prices are arbitrarily raised and prices vary. Moreover, there is no limit to ticket sales, and there is no system for getting on and off the bus. The bus is so crowded that it is still selling tickets, which adds a lot of difficulties to women and children taking the bus. Once it starts, it sways from side to side, which is very dangerous. And disputes often arise due to squeezing seats, which urgently needs to be improved.
　　2. The bad habits of checkpoint police have not changed. When a car drove out of the Shijiazhuang city checkpoint, a checkpoint policeman stopped the car, intending to let a person he brought get on the car without buying a ticket. However, because the passengers objected and drove the car away in time, he did not get on the car. When the car arrived at the Baoding public-private car joint parking station, an inspector in charge of inspection pointed to a person wearing a leather coat and said: "This is my friend, you all have to stay at his shop when you get off the car!" And the shop owner in the leather coat strutted back and forth in front of the people, looking very arrogant. These checkpoint police, inspectors, etc., are said to be former checkpoint police with old habits that have not changed and a bad work style, which urgently needs to be corrected. Therefore, I suggest:
　　1. The government transportation authorities should organize private transportation businesses, especially in terms of passenger transportation. In order to properly take care of the safety of women and children and avoid the danger of taking the bus, in addition to the unified regulation of car prices (price increases must be discussed by an organization such as a "trade association" and then apply for approval from the government authorities in charge), there must be a certain limit on ticket sales, and there should also be a system for getting on the bus, without allowing random grabbing and squeezing.
　　2. Education should be strengthened for some personnel who are responsible for checkpoints and inspection work. When performing tasks, our military and government comrades can be responsible for supervision or spot checks.

### 两点建议

　　两点建议编辑同志：
    从石家庄到北平途中，见到一些不合理的现象和问题，虽可能只是一时的现象，但仍需提起各该主管机关的注意及改进：
    一、私营客货汽车缺乏组织管理。现时往返于平石之间的私营长途汽车很多，由于分散经营，各自为政，以致票价随意提高，且价格不一。而卖票又漫无限制，上下车也无制度，车上挤得水泄不通，仍然卖票。给乘车的妇女儿童增加不少困难。一经开驶，东摇西摆，非常危险。且因挤座位时常引起纠纷，这是急需加以改善的。
    二、卡警恶习未改。汽车开出石家庄市卡时，一个卡警让汽车停住，打算叫他带来的一个人不买票上车，后因乘客反对并及时将车开走，才未上车。车到保定公私汽车联合停车站时，一个负责检查的纠察员，指着一个穿皮大衣的人说：“这是我的朋友，你们下车都要住他的店！”而那个穿皮衣的店主东，也就在人民面前摆来摆去，神气十足。这些卡警、纠察员等，据说都是出身旧卡警，旧习未改，作风恶劣，急需加以纠正。为此特建议：
    一、政府交通机关应把私营运输事业组织起来，特别是客运方面，为了适当照顾妇女儿童的安全及避免乘车危险，除车价统一规定外（涨价时须由“同业公会”一类的组织议定后，声请政府主管部门批准），卖票必须有一定限制，上车时也应有制度，不容乱抢乱挤。
    二、对某些担任关卡和纠察工作的人员，应加强教育。在执行任务时，可由我军政工作同志负责监督或抽查。　　　　　　（优言）
