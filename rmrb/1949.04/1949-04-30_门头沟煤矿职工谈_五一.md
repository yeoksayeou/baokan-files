Mentougou Coal Mine Workers Talk About "May Day"
　　Wéi Jìn

　　From the roaring machine rooms to the coal dust-filled mines, I visited many workers. They all unanimously called this year's "May Day" Labor Day "Welcoming the first joyous festival!" "Why is it called the first joyous festival?" Old miner Bai Baochun, in a loud and powerful voice, spoke of the oppression he suffered under the capitalists in the past, saying, "I came to the mine from my hometown of Beiping at the age of fifteen, selling my strength until I'm forty-five this year. The capitalists never treated us like human beings, cursing us coal blacks and keeping their distance when they saw us. Working underground was very dangerous: four pieces of rock sandwiching a piece of meat (meaning: surrounded by stone slabs and coal seams with only the human body being flesh), not knowing when you'd lose your life. But the foreman would say, 'If he dies, just wrap him in a straw mat and throw him out.' The foreman would even drink the blood of the dead: he'd report to the higher-ups, saying how much he spent on burial expenses. In short, with those bureaucratic capitalists running the factory, there was no way for the workers to survive. Liberation is good. The workers eat their fill, dress warmly, have housing (they used to live in riverbeds or under bridges), get medical care when they're sick, and receive compensation for injuries or death. Workers participate in the factory management committee, and workers have truly become the masters of the mine. Why do we get these benefits? Because we have the Communist Party, it is the workers' 'strength' (i.e., leadership); because we have the trade union, it is a 'guarantee' for the workers (also meaning leadership). This time, having turned ourselves around to welcome 'May Day,' we must stand firm in our resolve: unite, increase production, produce more coal, so that the electricity is good, we can make more guns and cannons, support the troops to defeat the Kuomintang reactionaries completely, and the working class can be thoroughly liberated!"

　　Zhang Ming, who used to be a coal miner and bravely delivered intelligence to the guerrillas, and who was recently elected by the people to the trade union as a labor protection committee member, recalled how the Kuomintang reactionaries restricted the workers' every move in the past, and how he now lives a life of freedom and democracy. How happy he is to express his "May Day" thoughts! He said, "In the past, if we said the wrong word, the capitalists would whip us. When we met on the road, we didn't dare to speak casually, we could only nod or wave; if we spoke casually, they would say we were holding a meeting for the Eighth Route Army, and we'd lose our heads. Now the Communist Party allows us to speak, and it feels so good. As a committee member, I can speak boldly to the workers, and the workers dare to raise their opinions to me. I reflect the opinions of the workers to the trade union. Now, based on the opinions of the workers, we are planning to do a good job in labor protection, so that the workers can step up production to welcome 'May Day.'"

　　Turner Song Fushen (currently also the chairman of the trade union) said, "In the past, when the 'May Day' came, the Kuomintang reactionaries would hold meetings for the workers and say, 'Labor is sacred! Long live the workers!' But they wouldn't say half a word about what 'May Day' was all about. Of course, they wouldn't mention it, they were afraid the workers would understand the meaning of 'May Day' and unite to resist."

　　Sand casting worker Wang Zhongli said, "What the Kuomintang reactionaries said and what they did were two different things, they simply treated the workers as fools. In 1946, a takeover official named Wu Hongyi came to the mine and held a meeting for the workers, saying, 'Now the mine belongs to the state, there is no capitalist exploitation and oppression, we will implement democracy, and anyone can raise their opinions.' Li San, a worker in the machine room, raised an opinion saying, 'In the past, wages were paid every tenth of the month, but now it's the seventeenth and wages haven't been paid yet. How can everyone live?' The official readily said, 'Good, this problem must be solved.' But the next day, just as Li San was happily thinking, 'The mine belongs to the motherland, and the workers' lives are guaranteed,' he suddenly received a notice from the mine saying, 'Worker No. 136 is suspended from work.' Li San immediately lost his job. In short, that's what the Kuomintang is like. The workers' answer to the Kuomintang's treatment of them was 'go-slow.' Now that we are liberated, the workers not only don't 'go-slow,' but also automatically started a production competition."

　　Liu Taichen, a young staff member of the transportation team, said, "This time, after liberation, the first new thing I felt was that the Communist Party uses people according to their talents and emphasizes democracy. During the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, they didn't care whether you had talent or not, they only looked to see if you had a backer. Subordinates didn't dare to raise opinions to superiors, especially us young people, who were often seen as showing off. If there was a problem, and you were labeled as being with the Eighth Route Army, you would not only lose your job but also face lawsuits. Now everyone has the right to speak, and this time everyone raised a lot of opinions about those unreasonable bureaucratic systems. The second new thing is that this year's welcome to 'May Day' is different from the past. In the past, when 'May Day' was approaching, the superiors would tell the staff to prepare for ball games, high jump, long jump, races, and other competitions. This year, 'May Day' also has competitions, but it's not those staff members playing ball games for people to watch, but our workers consciously competing to increase production and support the southward-bound army."

　　门头沟煤矿职工谈“五一”
    维  进
    从机声隆隆的机器房，到煤尘飞舞的煤井下，我访问许多职工，他们对于迎接今年“五一”劳动节，都不约而同称为“迎接头一个欢喜节！”“为什么叫它头一个欢喜节？”老矿工白宝纯以洪亮有力的声音从过去受资本家的压迫谈起，说：“我十五岁从老家北平城出来到矿山，卖气力卖到今年四十五岁，资本家从来不把我们当人看待，开口骂我们煤黑子，见面离得远远的。我们到在井下工作，很危险：四块石头夹一块肉（即：四面是石板与煤层只有人身是肉），不定哪天就卖了命。但是，包工头说：“死了，破席子把他卷出去。”，包工头还要喝死人的血：到上级报帐，说他花了多少葬埋费。说来说去，那些官僚资本家统治工厂，就没有工人活的路。这回解放算好了。工人吃的饱，穿的暖，有房住（过去经常住河滩或桥下），有病看病，伤亡领到抚恤金，工人参加工厂管理委员会，工人真个成了矿山的主人啦。为什么得到这些好处？因为有了共产党，它就是工人的“势力”（即领导）；因为有了工会，它就是工人的一个“把握”（亦即领导也）。这回翻过身来迎接“五一”节，就要立起咱们的志：团结起来，提高生产，多出一些煤，让电力磨好，就能多造枪炮，支援部队把国民党反动派打的翻不起身，工人阶级就能彻底解放！”
    曾经是挖煤工人，并英勇地给游击队送过情报，最近被民选到工会当劳动保护委员的张明，想起从前国民党反动派限制工人一举一动，现在过着自由民主的生活，他是多么高兴发表“五一”感想呵！他说：“过去说错一句话，资本家鞭打我们。我们在路上见面，不敢随便说话，只能摆摆头，摆摆手；如果随便说话，就说是八路开小组会，脑袋就保不住。现在共产党许我们说话，心里痛快。我当个委员，可以大胆给工人说话，工人有意见，也敢向我提。我代表工人的意见，向工会反映。现在我们根据工人的意见，正在计划办好劳动保护，使工人加紧提高生产，迎接‘五一’节”。
    车工宋福申（现兼任工会主任）说：“从前过‘五一’，国民党反动派给工人开会说：‘劳动神圣呀！工人万岁呀’！可是，‘五一’到底是怎么回事，半句话也不提。当然他不提啦，怕工人知道‘五一’的道理，团结起来反抗。”
    翻砂工人王钟利说：“国民党反动派说和干是两个事情，根本把工人当傻子看待。民国三十五年，矿里来了一个接管大员叫武弘毅，给工人开会说：‘现在矿山成了国家的了，没有资本家的剥削压迫，实行民主，谁有意见都能提。’机器房的工人李三提了一个意见说：‘从前每月逢十日发工资，现在到十七日还不发工资，大伙生活都成问题，怎么办？’这位大员痛快的说：‘好，这个问题要解决。’但是第二天，当李三正在高兴想着‘矿山归了祖国，工人生活有保障啦。’忽然接到矿方一个通知说：‘一百三十六号的工人停止上工。’李三便马上失业了。总之，国民党就是这个玩意。国民党这样对待工人，工人给他的回答就是‘磨洋工’，现在解放了，工人不但不‘磨洋工’，还自动展开生产比赛啦。”
    运输组的青年职员刘泰辰说：“这回解放，我感到第一件新鲜的事情，就是共产党量才用人，讲民主。在国民党反动派统治时期，不问有才能没才能，但看有靠山墙没靠山墙。下级不敢向上级提意见，特别是我们年青人，往往被认为出风头，有问题，如果扣上八路的帽子，打掉饭碗还要吃官司。现在谁都有说话的权利，这次大家对于那些不合理的官僚制度，就提出不少的意见。第二件新鲜的事情，就是今年迎接‘五一’节和从前不同。从前将到‘五一’节的时候，就是上面叫职员们准备球类比赛呀，跳高跳远赛跑等比赛呀。今年‘五一’倒也比赛，但不是那些职员们赛球玩给人家看，而是我们工人自觉的比赛提高生产，支援南下大军。”
