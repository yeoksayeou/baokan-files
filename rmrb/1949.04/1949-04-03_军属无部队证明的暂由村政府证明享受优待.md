Title: Dependents of military personnel without proof of unit affiliation will temporarily receive preferential treatment based on village government certification.

To the Editor:

Article 7 of the Regulations on Preferential Treatment for Families of Revolutionary Soldiers, promulgated by the North China People's Government and published in the People's Daily on February 9th, states: "If proof of unit affiliation cannot be obtained temporarily, the village people's representative assembly or village government may certify that they are not eligible for preferential treatment." Several comrades and I have studied this sentence and find it incomprehensible. Therefore, we are writing to request a clear answer.

To Comrades Liang Songlin and Ying Jun:

The question you raised has been answered by the North China People's Government as follows:

"If proof of unit affiliation cannot be obtained temporarily, the village people's representative assembly or village government may certify that they 'not' are eligible for preferential treatment." The word "not" is a mistake for the word "also." The North China People's Government has notified governments at all levels to correct this.

　　军属无部队证明的暂由村政府证明享受优待编辑同志：
    二月九日的人民日报登载的华北人民政府公布之革命军人家属优待条例之第七条说：“部队证明文件一时无法取得者，得暂由村人民代表会或村政府证明不得享受优待”。这一句话我曾经和几位同志研究都不通，故特来信请给一明确的答复。  　　　　梁松林　英隽梁松林、英隽二同志：
    你们所问的问题已请华北人民政府答复如下：
    “部队证明一时无法取得者，得暂由村人民代表会或村政府证明，‘不’得享受优待”，“不”字系“亦”字之误，华北人民政府已通知各级政府更正。
