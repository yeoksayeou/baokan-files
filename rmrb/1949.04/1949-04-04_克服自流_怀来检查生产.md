Overcoming Complacency
	Huailai Inspects Production
[Zhangjiakou News] Huailai County’s production work has not been done well recently. The County Production Committee, based on reports from various districts, conducted a review and identified the following reasons: (1) The County Party Committee's leadership was not focused. The County Production Conference was not well convened, and after the meeting, no dedicated force was organized to help the districts hold meetings. Furthermore, there was a lack of timely understanding of the situation at the lower levels. (2) Both the county and districts made the mistake of only deploying tasks without inspection. (3) The rumors spread by saboteurs were not promptly exposed, which affected the enthusiasm of the masses for production. In addition to conducting a deep review of the above deviations, the meeting also formulated specific plans for how to strengthen leadership in the future.

　　克服自流
  　怀来检查生产
    【张垣讯】怀来县这一个时期生产工作没作好，县生产委员会根据各区汇报，作了检讨。找出以下几点原因：（一）县委领导精神不集中，县生产会议没开好，会后又没组织一定力量帮助区里开会，同时对下边的情况了解不及时。（二）县、区都犯了只布置不检查的毛病。（三）没及时揭破坏分子的谣言，以致影响群众生产热情。会议除对上述偏向作了深刻的检讨外，并作出今后如何加强领导的具体计划。
