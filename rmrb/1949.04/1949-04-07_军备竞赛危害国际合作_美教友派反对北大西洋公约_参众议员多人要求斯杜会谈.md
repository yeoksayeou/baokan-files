Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, April 6th: TASS reports: The New York Times correspondent in Philadelphia reports: American Quakers recently passed a resolution opposing the North Atlantic Treaty, stating: "We call on our country to cooperate with other countries to stop the arms race. The arms race risks destroying civilization and increasing the danger of war, and endangers the United Nations' ideal of 'One World'."

Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, April 5th: According to the Diantong News Agency in Washington: Democratic Congressman Mansfield said on the 2nd that several members of the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives are demanding a meeting between Truman and Stalin. Mansfield said: Some members of Congress have met with Truman to request him to hold talks with Stalin. Mansfield also said that he and his colleagues believe that it would be very beneficial if Truman and Stalin tried to talk directly to reach an agreement on issues between the United States and the Soviet Union. Mansfield's remarks, along with the news of members of Congress meeting with Truman, were suppressed by American news authorities, especially Truman's press secretary, Ross.

    参众议员多人要求斯杜会谈
    【新华社北平六日电】塔斯社讯：纽约时报驻费城记者报道：美国教友派近通过反对北大西洋公约的决议，内称：“我们号召我们的国家同其他国家合作，以阻止军备竞赛。军备竞赛有破坏文明和增加战争的危险，并危害了联合国‘天下一家’的理想。”
    【新华社北平五日电】据电通社华盛顿消息：民主党众议员孟斯斐尔德二日说，美国参众两院的若干议员，正在要求杜鲁门与斯大林会谈。孟斯斐尔德说：某些国会议员曾往见杜鲁门，要求他和斯大林举行会谈。孟斯斐尔德又说，他和他的同事们相信，如果杜鲁门和斯大林试图直接会谈，以求在美苏之间的问题上达成协议，那将是很有益的。孟斯斐尔德的谈话连同国会议员谒见杜鲁门的消息，都被美国新闻当局特别是杜鲁门的新闻秘书罗斯所扣压。
