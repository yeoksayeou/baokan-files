Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 14th: Reports from various sources indicate that a crisis has occurred in the royalist fascist cabinet in Athens. Premier Sophoulis submitted his resignation on the 12th. The reason for the cabinet crisis is the serious defeat suffered by the royalist fascist army in the anti-people's war in the Grammos Mountains, and the chaos caused by the involvement of many cabinet ministers in a large counterfeit currency scandal. According to Diantong News Agency, those involved in the scandal include Foreign Minister Tsaldaris, Minister Without Portfolio Makkenizis, and other ministers. King Paul of Greece is also implicated. Paul ordered Sophoulis to form a new cabinet after Sophoulis resigned.

　　雅典内阁发生危机
    【新华社北平十四日电】据各方报道：雅典保皇法西斯内阁发生危机，总理索福利斯已于十二日提出辞职。内阁危机的原因是保皇法西斯军近来在格拉姆斯山区的反人民战争中遭到严重失败，同时又由于内阁许多部长卷入造假币的大舞弊案而紊乱不堪。据电通社称：卷入舞弊案的包括外长曹达利斯、不管部长马肯尼齐斯及其他部长，希王保罗也牵涉在内。保罗已于索福利斯辞职后命他重新组阁。
