[Jizhong Electric] 1,396 students, 73 faculty members, and 38 workers who returned to Baoding from Peiping had resumed work and classes by the end of March. Before resuming classes, they underwent general political education, the content of which included: "The Current Situation and Our Tasks," youth and student issues, industrial and commercial policies, land policies, and policies regarding intellectuals. Through this stage of study, their political awareness was raised, some previous concerns were beginning to be dispelled, and they began to understand our Party's policies. After we announced the dissolution of "Si Cun" (likely a school or organization), the teachers and students of the school demanded to accuse Zhang Yinwu, and some teachers and students began to reflect some true situations. Under these circumstances, the returning teachers and students from Peiping merged with parts one and two of Baoding Lianzhong (likely a joint middle school), and were divided into Baoding No. 1 Middle School, No. 2 Middle School, Girls' Middle School, and Normal School, and are now beginning regular study.

　　由平返保师生
  　就业复课
    【冀中电】由北平返保定的学生一千三百九十六名，教职员七十三名，工友三十八名，于三月底已就业复课。在复课前经过一般政治教育，内容为：“目前形势和我们的任务”、青年学生问题、工商业政策、土地政策、知识分子政策等。经过这一阶段学习，提高了他们的政治觉悟，对以前所存在的某些顾虑开始消除，对我党政策开始了解。当我们宣布解散“四存”后，该校师生要求控诉张荫悟，并有些师生开始反映一些真实情况。在这种情况下，返保师生与保定联中一部二部合并，分为保定一中、二中、女中、师范四校，现开始正规学习。
