　　Liberated Area Workers and Students Protest Nanjing Massacre
  　Demand PLA Swiftly Cross the Yangtze River
    [This newspaper comprehensive report] The Nanjing Kuomintang reactionary traitorous government's "April 1st" massacre of patriotic students has aroused the anger of young people in liberated areas. The Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Youth Federation, the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region Student Federation, and the Yan'an University Student Union, on the 6th, sent a telegram to the All-China Student Federation, voicing support for the just actions of Nanjing students demanding genuine peace. The Kaifeng City Student Federation convened a meeting of committee members from all secondary schools and above in the city on the 4th, issuing a circular telegram denouncing the Kuomintang reactionaries. The preparatory committee of the Zhangjiakou City Student Federation issued a circular telegram saying: "This great tragedy tells us that the Nanjing reactionary government's seeking peace is just using negotiations as a cover." The circular telegram stated: "Resolutely support and assist the People's Liberation Army to swiftly cross the Yangtze River, capture all murderers, and achieve genuine peace." More than 5,000 students from Tongzhou Municipal Secondary School and 30 elementary schools held a "Tongzhou Students Protest Nanjing Massacre, Oppose Fake Peace, Support Genuine Peace Rally" at the square inside the South Gate on the 6th. Teachers and staff from public and private primary and secondary schools in the city, as well as workers from the Telecommunications Bureau, attended the meeting. After the meeting passed a protest telegram, they set off on a parade to carry out propaganda to the masses. Teachers from public and private primary and secondary schools in the city also issued a letter of inquiry to the Nanjing reactionary government's peace talk representatives and a letter of condolence to Nanjing students. Students from Ping City Chaoyang University and Shanxi University also protested one after another. In recent days, all wall newspaper organizations at Chaoyang University have unanimously demanded the early liberation of Jiangnan and the capture alive of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang to avenge the dead classmates! The protest letter from Shanxi University students stated: "We must use all our strength to support China's liberation war." The protest letter from teachers, students, and workers of the Normal University Affiliated High School said: "We have suffered many times from the reactionaries' poisonous methods, and we have long seen through their hideous faces." They believe that those executioners who kill without blinking an eye must be severely punished.
