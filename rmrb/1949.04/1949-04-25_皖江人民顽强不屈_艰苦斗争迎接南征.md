　　Xinhua News Agency, Bengbu, 23rd: News from the Yangtze River front: When the Third Field Army of the People's Liberation Army, crossing the Yangtze River in the middle reaches, passed through the Chaoxian and Wuwei areas of central Anhui, groups of residents complained to the PLA about the crimes of the Kuomintang bandits. This area was originally the Wanjiang Liberated Area established by the Seventh Division of the New Fourth Army during the War of Resistance Against Japan. After Japan surrendered, the division was ordered to withdraw in order to seek domestic peace. After suffering three and a half years of devastation by the bandit gangs, the local people could not help but be overcome with mixed feelings of sorrow and joy when they saw the PLA again. They told the PLA that as soon as the Kuomintang bandit gangs arrived, they stigmatized the people who resisted Japan as "bandits" and carried out suppression by means of forced "confessions" and "five-family joint guarantee" systems. Countless outstanding sons and daughters died under the executioner's knife. In Baiyuan District of Wuwei County alone, more than 60 people were killed last year. A bandit defense director named Gao Laoping, stationed in Cangtou Town in the northeast of the county, personally killed 145 people in three months. The Kuomintang bandit gangs forced the people to pay supplementary taxes and conscription fees for the four years after the bandit army fled during the War of Resistance Against Japan, and colluded with local tyrants and landlords to retroactively settle accounts with farmers who had implemented rent reduction and interest rate reduction under the democratic government. As a result, many farmers were ruined and fled to other places. The Kuomintang bandit gangs carried out another large-scale looting before fleeing. The 46th Division of the bandit army stayed in Chengjiadian, Jiangjiaqiao and other places for two days, and most of the women who did not have time to escape were raped. As for the loss of people's houses and property, it is impossible to count. The people of Wanjiang also told the PLA that they had not succumbed. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, they organized guerrilla teams and persisted in more than three years of arduous struggle. After hearing the news that the PLA was about to cross the river on a southern expedition, every household made a pair of shoes, waiting to give them to the PLA.

　　皖江人民顽强不屈
    艰苦斗争迎接南征
    【新华社蚌埠二十三日电】长江前线消息：在长江中游南渡的人民解放军第三野战军，当通过安徽中部巢县、无为地区时，成群结队的居民，向解放军控诉国民党匪帮的罪恶。这地方原是新四军第七师在抗日战争中建立起来的皖江解放区，日本投降后，该师为求国内和平，奉命撤离。当地人民在遭受匪帮三年半的摧残以后，一旦重见解放军，不禁悲喜交集。他们告诉解放军，国民党匪帮一来，就污蔑抗日革命的人民是“匪”，用强迫“自首”和“五家联保”等办法进行镇压。无数优秀儿女死在刽子手的屠刀之下，无为县白苑区一个区去年一年被杀害的就有六十多人。驻在该县东北仓头镇的一个叫高老平的匪联防主任，三个月内，就亲手杀了一百四十五人。国民党匪帮逼迫人民补交抗日时期匪军逃跑后四年中的捐税和壮丁费，并纠结恶霸地主向在民主政府管辖时实行了减租减息的农民倒算。许多农民因而倾家荡产，逃亡他乡。国民党匪帮在临逃时，又进行了一次大规模的洗劫。匪军四十六师在程家店、江家桥等地住了两天，没有来得及逃避的妇女大部分都被奸污。至于人民房屋财产的损失，更无法计数。皖江人民又告诉解放军，他们并没有屈服，在共产党领导下，他们组织了游击队，坚持了三年多艰苦斗争。听到解放军要渡江南征的消息以后，每家都做了一双鞋，等着送给解放军。
