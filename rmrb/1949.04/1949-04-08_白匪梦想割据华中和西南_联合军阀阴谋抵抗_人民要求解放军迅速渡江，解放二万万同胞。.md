Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 7th: The Central Plains People's Liberation Army captured a secret telegram from Bai Chongxi, dated February 18th and forwarded by Zhang Gan, commander of the Kuomintang bandit army's Third Army Corps, on February 25th, during the battle in the Huayuanshi Zhoujiamiao area of the Pinghan Railway on the 1st. The telegram stated: "Today, in order to protect five thousand years of historical culture and to safeguard the people's free way of life, we should, on the basis of the common belief in the Three Principles of the People, unite as one, regardless of regional boundaries or party affiliations, and fight to the death. We should especially support the central authorities to make effective decisions. Otherwise, if everyone acts on their own and disperses their forces, the painful historical lessons of countless failures in ancient and modern times will fall upon us! I believe that the CCP's current victory is due to the major political defects of our past. There was little coordinated fighting in the military, and there were no measures to guarantee a livelihood suitable for the people throughout the entire period. As a result, the people's hearts were scattered, and morale was low. North of the Yangtze River gradually fell. We must not forget the past as a guide for the future. In total, our side still possesses the provinces of Southwest, Southeast, and Northwest China, with a large population and vast land, and abundant resources. Observing the international situation, there are still many who sympathize with our country. If we can unite as one, revive and become strong, and first improve ourselves, then we will not have to worry about foreign aid not arriving, or the people's hearts and morale not being boosted. Turning danger into safety is a matter of human effort. Central China is at the forefront and is a barrier for the southwestern provinces. Chongxi is entrusted with a heavy responsibility but lacks talent. Although he knows that it is difficult to win, since he has dedicated himself to the country, he should prepare for a rainy day. Therefore, as a man of limited talent, I make a request for assistance. Gentlemen, I hope you will rise up together and quickly make plans for survival and national salvation." Bai Chongxi's stubborn and reactionary tone in this circular is no different from that of Chiang Kai-shek's diehards, indicating his determination to lean towards the diehards. Although he admits that "the people's hearts are scattered and morale is low" and that he has reached a dead end, he not only has no remorse, nor does he have any plans to surrender to the people in order to achieve true peace; but also vainly attempts to seize areas in Central and Southwest China, unite with other warlords, "unite as one, regardless of regional boundaries or party affiliations, and fight to the death," and beg for further assistance from foreign imperialism, "revive and become strong," and make a comeback. Bai Chongxi vainly attempts to use the guise of "peace" to deceive and bluff, and even demands that the People's Liberation Army stop advancing in order to preserve counter-revolutionary strength and resist the implementation of the CCP's Eight Peace Proposals. However, the Chinese people have rich political experience. What the people pay attention to is not Bai Chongxi's rhetoric, but his secret order to "fight to the death," his bombing of the Changtaiguan Huaihe River Bridge on the Pinghan Railway, his looting of the people in the Dabie Mountains, and his preparation to flood Hankou and Shashi, etc. a series of perverse actions. The people demand that the People's Liberation Army quickly cross the river, eliminate counter-revolutionary conspiracies, and achieve true democratic peace, in order to liberate 200 million compatriots in deep water.

　　白匪梦想割据华中和西南
  　联合军阀阴谋抵抗
    人民要求解放军迅速渡江，解放二万万同胞。
    【新华社北平七日电】中原人民解放军于一日平汉路花园市周家庙地区战斗中，缴获国民党匪军第三兵团司令张淦于二月二十五日转白崇禧二月十八日的机密电一份。该电内称：吾人今日为爱护五千年历史文化，为保障人民自由的生活方式，应在三民主义共同信仰基础下，不分畛域，不问党派，团结一致，作殊死斗争。尤当支持中枢，作有效之决策。否则人自为谋，分散力量，古今多少失败惨痛历史教训，转瞬落到吾人头上矣！窃谓中共今日幸胜，皆为我过去政治上有重大缺陷所给予，军事既少协同奋斗，整个时期政治又无适合民生之措施保证。致影响所及，民心离散，士气消沉，大江以北，逐渐沦陷。夫前事不忘，后事之师。总计我方现尚拥有西南、东南、西北各省，民众而地广，物资亦丰富。默察国际情势，同情我国者尚大有所在。如我辈能团结一致，振兴为雄，先从本身健全，则外援不患不致，人心士气不患不振，转危为安，事在人为。华中地当前线，且为西南各省之屏藩。崇禧任重材辁，明知艰巨难胜，惟既属以身许国，亦当未雨绸缪。故以樗栎之材，作发声之求，诸公明达，尚希共起，速作图存救亡之计。白崇禧在这个通电中的顽固反动口吻与蒋介石死党毫无二致，表明决心向死党靠拢。他虽然自认“民心离散、士气消沉”，到了山穷水尽的境地，但是不但没有悔祸之心，没有向人民投降以便实现真和平的打算；而且妄图割据华中和西南，联合其他军阀，“不分畛域，不问党派，团结一致，作殊死斗争”，并乞求外国帝国主义的进一步援助，“振兴为雄”，卷土重来。白崇禧妄想假借“和平”的幌子招摇撞骗，居然要求人民解放军停止前进，以图保存反革命实力，抗抵中共八项和平主张的实现。但中国人民已有丰富的政治经验，人民所注意的不是白崇禧的花言巧语，而是他的“作殊死斗争”的密令，是他炸毁平汉路长台关淮河大桥，抢劫大别山人民，准备水淹汉口、沙市等等一连串的倒行逆施。人民要求解放军迅速渡江，消灭反革命的阴谋诡计，实现真正的民主的和平，以解放二万万处于水深火热中的同胞。
