　　"Mao Zedong" Locomotive
　　By our reporter Zhou Ziqin
　　The "Mao Zedong" locomotive, renowned throughout the Northeast, arrived in Fengtai on March 27th. As it passed through stations like Shenyang, Jinzhou, and Shanhaiguan, it received warm welcomes from the staff at each station.
　　The predecessor of the "Mao Zedong" locomotive was the No. 304 locomotive left behind by the Japanese. When the Democratic Allied Forces entered Harbin, it was still a broken-down vehicle. After being repaired, it achieved excellent results in the Northeast's implementation of the contracted responsibility system and was selected as a "Model Locomotive." After the Sixth Labor Congress, in order to maintain the honor of "Model Locomotive," the workers proposed learning from Chairman Mao and named it the "Mao Zedong" locomotive.
　　During the Northeast Democratic Allied Forces' battle to take Dehui in 1947, enemy planes flew low, strafing and bombing. Several locomotive drivers were wounded. At that time, the "Mao Zedong" locomotive was responsible for the important task of transporting military supplies and ammunition, and the workers completed the task perfectly amidst the flying bombs.
　　In one month, excluding four days for repairs, the "Mao Zedong" locomotive traveled 10,400 kilometers. Since participating in the Liberation War, it has traveled more than 137,000 kilometers safely. It has only undergone one "Class A Inspection." In North China, a general locomotive can only run a maximum of 35,000 kilometers; in the Northeast, the maximum is 50,000 kilometers. The "Mao Zedong" locomotive's safe speed has created a surprising national record.
　　The "Mao Zedong" locomotive has a total of nine workers: three drivers, three firemen, and three apprentice firemen, divided into three shifts. They implemented the contracted responsibility system from the very beginning. The chief driver is the famous old hero Li Yong, 49 years old, who has now been selected as an instructor driver. Last "May Day," he was awarded a major commendation, a reward of 10,000 yuan, and a flag and certificate for the high number of kilometers traveled safely, saving oil, saving coal, and saving materials. All nine of them have learned driving, repairing, and stoking, so they can help each other with technical learning. The locomotive is cleaned every time it runs. Every time a task comes, they actively respond and take the lead. This year, after the successful trial implementation of the locomotive circulation system, the administration called for a safe speed of 400,000 kilometers from March 10th to "May Day." Li Yong called out at the meeting that they would not only complete 400,000 kilometers, but also exceed it. And he guaranteed that there would be no accidents, and it was planned to travel 600,000 kilometers by "May Day" this year.
　　On March 21st, the "Mao Zedong" locomotive received an order to go to North China. Everyone immediately repaired the locomotive and brushed on the oil, and proposed that after arriving in North China, they would establish the "Mao Zedong" locomotive's banner in North China, and even in all of China. This is not an exaggeration: after arriving in Fengtai, their technology and style have greatly promoted the contracted responsibility system at Fengtai Station, presenting a new look to the work at Fengtai Station.

### “毛泽东号”机车

　　“毛泽东号”机车
    本报记者  周子芹
    誉满东北的“毛泽东号”机车，于三月二十七日由哈尔滨开到了丰台。她在经过沈阳、锦州、山海关等车站时，受到各站职工的热烈欢迎。
    “毛泽东号”的前身，是过去日本人留下的三○四号机车，在民主联军进入哈尔滨时，还是一个破车，经修理后，在东北实行包乘制中，建树了良好的成绩，被选为“模范号”。六次劳动大会后，工人们为了保持“模范号”的荣誉，提出要向毛主席学习，便命名为“毛泽东号”。
    在一九四七年东北民主联军打德惠的战斗中，敌机低飞扫射轰炸，有好几个机车的司机都被打伤了。当时“毛泽东号”担任运输军用品与弹药的重大任务，工人们在炸弹横飞中把任务圆满完成。
    “毛泽东号”在一个月内，除去四天的修理时间，曾经跑过一万零四百公里，从参加解放战争以来到现在，已走了安全速度十三万七千多公里。其中只“甲检”过一次。在华北，一般机车最多只能跑三万五千公里；东北机车最多能跑五万公里。“毛泽东号”的安全速度创造了全国的惊人纪录。
    “毛泽东号”共有九个工人：司机、司炉、学习司炉各三人，共分成三班工作。他们从一开始就实行了包乘制。司机长是四十九岁的有名的老英雄李勇，现在已被选为指导司机。去年“五一”节，因安全行走的公里多、省油、省煤、省材料，曾记大功一次，得奖金一万元，奖旗奖状各一。他们九个人都学会了开车、修车、烧炉等工作，故可互相帮助进行技术学习。机车每走一次就擦洗一次。每次任务一来，他们就积极起来响应，带头。今年试验实行机车循环制成功后，行政上号召由三月十号，到“五一”要走安全速度四十万公里。李勇在大会上号召，不但完成四十万公里，还要超过。并且保证不出事故，预定到今年“五一”要走六十万公里。
    三月二十一日“毛泽东号”接获开到华北的命令，大家立即修车刷油，并提出到华北以后要把“毛泽东号”的旗子树立到华北，以至全中国。这话并不夸张：到丰台以后，他们的技术和作风，已把丰台站的包乘制大大推进了一步，使丰台车站的工作呈现了一幅新的面貌。
