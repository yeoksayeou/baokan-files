　　Challenge and Response
  　A Record of the Symposium of Worker Representatives from Public Enterprises in Beiping
    [Special Feature from Our Newspaper] On the afternoon of the 19th, 210 worker representatives from more than 40 public enterprise units in Beiping, at the invitation of the Beiping Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, discussed a major event of historical significance: how to effectively transform Beiping from a consumer city into a production city.
    Every word of the speech by Comrade Peng Zhen, Secretary of the Municipal Party Committee, struck the hearts of the representatives. The various principles and methods he announced regarding rational reform of institutions, appropriate adjustment of personnel, and adjustment of wages were precisely the issues that the representatives and more than 60,000 workers in public enterprises throughout the city were concerned about, and now there are solutions. Zhang Shuxun, a worker representative from the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, excitedly jumped onto the stage and said: "When the reactionaries were in power, they oppressed us workers. Now we have turned over. Comrade Peng Zhen's words are exactly what the workers in our factory mean. The workers in our factory are all satisfied with the wage treatment. We will definitely increase production. Before, we produced three steel ingots in two days, now we produce twelve steel ingots in one day!" Zhang Shuqing, a worker from the Mentougou Coal Mine, said: "In the past, we produced 900 tons of coal every day, now we can produce 1,965 tons of coal a day." The conference hall was overflowing with the heroic spirit of the working class. Sun Yishu, a worker representative from the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, stood up and said loudly: "The more than 3,000 workers in our steel plant dare to challenge all public enterprise factories in Beiping. The conditions we propose are: (1) Maintain the existing level and strive for further improvement in production. (2) All comrades working in the trade union should not make mistakes and ensure that they act according to the instructions of the Municipal Party Committee."
    A worker representative from the Chengzi Coal Mine said: "As long as the power doesn't go out, we will accept the challenge."
    A worker representative from the Post Office said: "We guarantee the fast delivery of news and intelligence, and will never affect your 'strategy'." A burst of hearty laughter erupted in the hall.
    The worker representative from the 70th Ordnance Factory was even stronger. He said vigorously: "Having brought up the challenge, we will definitely guarantee that the anti-aircraft guns are repaired. As soon as we aim, we can shoot down the reactionaries' planes."
    Lu Shenming, a worker from the People's Printing Factory, was so excited that he wrote a challenge poem on the spot.
    A worker representative from the Pingjin Railway Bureau said: "We respond to the challenge. As long as there is electricity, we will transport coal for you. As long as steel is produced, we will transport it for you. We guarantee to transport the troops well to the south of the Yangtze River."
    At this time, Wang Wenbin, a worker representative from the Shijingshan Power Plant, said humorously: "We dare not challenge, because there are too many people monitoring us, but in today's situation, we will challenge even if we don't want to, we will fight even if we don't want to!"
    A worker representative from the Telecommunications Bureau said: "Our challenge conditions are: (1) Telegrams are sent quickly (2) Telephone calls are connected accurately; (3) Circuits are checked frequently, and we are notified when they are broken."
    "Three sentences cannot leave the profession," a worker representative from the Beiping Film Studio said: "We will also rise up and respond to the challenge, and guarantee that the shots of the production challenges of each factory are captured in the film!" The enthusiastic scene of challenge and response continued until late at night. Everyone didn't feel hungry even without eating. Finally, when the chairman announced the adjournment of the meeting, many units were still rushing to hand slips to the chairman's podium. (Xiao Du, Baisheng)

　　挑战与应战
  　记平市公营企业工人代表座谈会
    【本报特写】十九日下午，平市四十多个公营企业单位的二百一十名工人代表，应中国共产党北平市委会之邀，商议着一件具有历史意义的大事——怎样有效地把北平这个消费城市变成生产城市。
    市委书记彭真同志的讲话，每一字句都打在代表们的心上，他所宣布的合理的改革机构，适当的调整人事、调整工资的各项方针与办法，正是代表们以及全市公营企业六万多工人所关心的问题，现在都有解决的办法了。石景山钢铁厂工人代表张树勋兴奋的跳上讲台说：“反动派在时，欺压我们工人，现在我们翻身了，彭真同志的话正是我们厂子里工人的意思。我们厂子里的工人对工资待遇都满意，我们一定提高生产，以前我们两天出三块钢砖，现在我们一天就出十二块钢砖！”门头沟煤矿工人张淑清说：“过去我们每天产九百吨煤，现在我们一天能产一千九百六十五吨煤。”会场上横溢着工人阶级的英雄气概，石景山钢铁厂工人代表孙以恕站起来响亮地说：“我们钢铁厂里三千多工人，敢向北平市所有公营企业工厂挑战，我们提出的条件是：（一）保持现有水平，争取生产的再提高一步。（二）所有作职工会工作的同志不要犯错误，保证根据市委指示去做。”
    城子煤矿工人代表说：“只要不停电，我们就应战。”
    邮政局的工人代表说：“保证消息、情报传递的快，决不影响诸位的‘战略’”。会上掀起一阵爽朗的笑声。
    七十兵工厂工人代表更不弱，他很带劲地说：“提起了挑战，我们一定保证把高射炮修好，只要一瞄，反动派的飞机就可以打掉。”
    人民印刷厂工人路申明兴奋得不得了，当场写了一首挑战诗。
    平津铁路局工人代表说：“我们响应挑战，只要发电，我们给你运煤，只要出了钢，我们给你运，保证把队伍好好的送到江南。”
    这时石景山发电厂的工人代表王文斌幽默地说：“我们不敢挑战，因为监视我们的人太多，但在今天的情况下，我们不挑也挑，不战也战！”
    电信局工人代表说：“我们的挑战条件是（一）电报打的快（二）电话接得准；（三）电路勤查看，坏了通知我们管。”
    “三句话不离本行”，北平电影制片厂工人代表说：“我们也起来应战，保证把各厂生产挑战的镜头都摄到片子中去！”挑战应战的热烈场面，一直继续至深夜，没吃饭大家也都不觉得饿，最后主席宣布散会时，还有许多单位抢着向主席台上递条子。（小杜，柏生）
