　　Huo Jia Yao Branch Mobilizes All Villagers
  　Accumulate New Fertilizer Before the Spring Busy Season
    Guarantee Topdressing of Wheat Fields
  　Increase Manure by Five Loads Per Mu for Autumn Fields
    [Taihang Electric] This reporter Li Wen reports: The Hujia Yao Village Branch in the sixth district of Licheng, a Taihang production model village, has overcome the "complacency" and "conservatism" in production, and is leading the masses to topdress wheat fields and increase manure by five loads per mu for autumn fields, launching a new fertilizer accumulation campaign before the spring busy season. In late last month, the village branch committee, in accordance with the spirit of the county party congress, convened various meetings and, under the leadership of the People's Representative Assembly, conducted a full-scale production mobilization in the village; however, due to the failure to adequately combine the specific conditions of the village with the thinking of the masses for thorough deliberation, coupled with the failure of village cadres to delve into the masses to solve specific problems, the spring plowing preparation work was still in a state of laissez-faire, and the following problems existed: First, the majority of the masses believed that they had already prepared about thirty loads of manure per mu, compared to the past application of twenty loads per mu (the village's fertilizer application had reached this level last year), which was almost enough. Although the village has the habit of weeding wheat, most of the masses expressed doubts about topdressing wheat fields due to their lack of experience; some also feared that topdressing wheat fields would lead to a shortage of fertilizer for autumn fields. Second, there was considerable blindness in farmers' production; in the preparation for spring plowing, many households focused on engaging in sideline occupations and neglected to actively improve the conditions for increasing production. The more common situation was that there was a lot of fertilizer accumulated in the fall and winter of last year, but this spring was relaxed. In addition to pen manure and sheep manure, no other methods were used to accumulate new fertilizer. Some households were only concerned with transportation, and to date, there were still one hundred and twenty loads of pen manure not transported to the fields, dozens of loads of sheep manure not taken out, and the land that needed to be repaired was not repaired. After the village work team learned about the above situation from discussions with various classes, mutual aid team discussions, old farmer discussions, and individual visits, they conducted research and believed that it was necessary to reverse the mood of complacency and conservative thinking among cadres and the masses, and strive to topdress wheat and accumulate new fertilizer in order to achieve the production increase plan. After the branch committee and the general membership meeting, everyone believed that thirty loads of good manure per mu for millet land was sufficient and should not be excessive; the more manure applied to wheat and corn fields, the better, and wheat fields should be topdressed. The meeting also analyzed the village's advanced examples: generally, each mu yields about five dou of wheat, while Huo Peizhong can harvest one stone and two dou per mu, and Fan Fusheng can chop more than three hundred jin of firewood a day, which is more than double that of the average person, thereby criticizing the "complacency" and "conservatism" viewpoints, and inspiring a positive labor mood for increasing production. It was decided to launch a village-wide upsurge of topdressing; to solve the difficulty of lacking autumn fertilizer, a new fertilizer accumulation campaign was launched at the same time. The general membership meeting also helped four party members on the spot to make plans for topdressing and increasing fertilizer for autumn fields. For example, Wang Haiwen, who has more than sixteen mu of land, including five mu and six fen of wheat land, applied thirty-five loads of manure per mu last fall, and now plans to topdress ten loads per mu. Last year, the autumn land applied thirty-five loads of manure per mu, and he plans to increase the manure by ten loads per mu this year, requiring a total of four hundred and ninety-six loads of manure. He currently has two hundred loads of sheep manure, one hundred loads of sludge manure, and forty loads of pen manure, totaling three hundred and forty loads, leaving a shortage of one hundred and fifty loads of fertilizer. He currently has three mu of corn stalks, and by cutting some artemisia grass, he can produce the required fertilizer before the spring busy season. Currently, all party members are actively promoting the increase and accumulation of new fertilizer.

　　霍家窑支部发动全村农民
  　春忙前多积新肥
    保证麦地普上追肥
  　秋地每亩增粪五驮
    【太行电】本报记者力文报导：太行生产模范村黎城六区霍家窑村支部，克服生产中的“自满”、“守旧”思想，领导群众麦地上追肥，秋地每亩增粪五驮，在春忙前开展积新肥运动。上月下旬，该村支部会根据县党代大会精神，召开了各种会议，并在人民代表会领导下进行了全村生产大动员；但因未能很好结合本村具体情况与群众思想进行充分酝酿，加之村干部未深入群众解决具体问题，因之春耕准备工作仍处自流状态，并存在以下问题：一是大部分群众认为过去每亩地上粪二十驮，现下已准备有三十驮了（该村去年施肥已达此水平），差不多了。该村虽有锄麦习惯，但对麦地上追肥，多数群众因无此习惯，表示怀疑；也有的怕麦地上了追肥，秋地缺肥。一是农民生产存在很大盲目性，春耕准备中，不少户偏重搞副业而忽视了积极的改进增产条件。较为普遍的情况是去年秋冬积肥多，今春放松，除圈粪羊粪外，未用其他方法积新肥。甚至有一户只顾搞运输，至今尚有一百二十驮圈粪未往地运送，数十驮羊粪未出，需修的地未修。该村工作组从各阶层座谈、互助组座谈、老农座谈、个别访问中，了解以上情况后，作了研究，认为必须扭转干部、群众满足现状的情绪与守旧思想，争取麦地上追肥并积新肥，才能实现增产计划。经过支部委员会、党员大会，大家认为谷地上好粪三十驮即可，不宜过多；麦地、玉蜀黍地，粪土越多越好，麦地宜上追肥。会上并分析了本村的先进事例：一般户每亩收麦五斗左右，而霍培忠每亩能收麦一石二斗，樊福生一天打柴三百余斤，超过一般人一倍，从而批判了“自满”与“守旧”观点，启发了积极增产的劳动情绪。决定掀起全村上追肥热潮；为解决缺秋肥的困难，同时开展积新肥运动。党员大会并当场帮助四个党员，作了上追肥、秋地增肥计划。例如王海文，十六亩多地，麦地五亩六分，去秋每亩上三十五驮粪，现计划每亩上追肥十驮，去年秋地每亩上粪三十五驮，计划今年秋地每亩增粪十驮，共需用四百九十六驮粪，现有二百驮羊粪，一百驮污土粪与圈粪四十驮，共三百四十驮，尚缺肥一百五十驮，他现存三亩地的玉蜀黍秆，再割些草蒿，春忙前即可薰出所缺乏之肥。现全体党员正积极推动增肥与积新肥运动。
