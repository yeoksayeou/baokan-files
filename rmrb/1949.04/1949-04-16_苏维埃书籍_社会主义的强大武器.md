　　Soviet Books—A Powerful Weapon of Socialism
　　Translated by Jun Qiang
　　We can judge the cultural level of a country by the abundance of its books. In this regard, the first place in the world belongs to the Soviet Union. We publish more books than any other country in the world. Not only in quantity, but also in quality, Soviet books are different from those published in capitalist countries. They are permeated with leading and progressive theories, and they truly serve the interests of the people. Soviet books have not been tainted by certain publications, such as those that obscure the people's consciousness with the poison of superstition and mystery, or those that degrade readers with vulgar, criminal "literature" or other dross. However, such commodities occupy the first place in the publishing circles of petty-bourgeois capitalist countries.
　　In the Soviet Union, the publication of books is only for the political, scientific, and artistic education of the people. Books are the most important weapon of the Bolshevik Party. Comrade Stalin said: "We must make all workers and peasants cultured and educated, and now we must do this." Therefore, the preparation for the distribution and dissemination of books is the most important part of the theoretical front.
　　Our success in publishing is great and undeniable. Before the Great October Socialist Revolution, villages knew almost nothing about books. They also knew nothing about libraries. Now there are nearly 50,000 village libraries with more than 40 million books.
　　Not only has the number of copies issued increased, but also the number of editions. There has never been anything similar in the capitalist book world, nor could there be. The hundreds of editions of the collections of works by Lenin and Stalin can fully point out this characteristic. In addition, "The History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) Short Course" has been published 34 million copies in the Soviet Union in ten years—this is an unprecedented phenomenon!
　　Before 1917, Russian books, with a few exceptions, were only available in Russian. Soviet federal books are now available in more than 100 languages. Among these languages, many were only given writing and literature by the national policies of Lenin and Stalin.
　　Fascist German invaders destroyed Soviet books everywhere they went. They burned libraries and destroyed printing presses and paper mills... In those heavy days, the Soviet people risked their lives, hid from the enemy, and preserved printed materials as if they were the most precious treasures of the Soviet Union.
　　The enemy brought major damage to the Soviet book printing industry. In some places liberated from the Hitlerite bandits, the revived schools had no textbooks and no printing equipment. The Bolshevik Party, the Soviet government, and the entire Soviet public rose up to help the suffering republics and states.
　　After a short period, the publishing industry reached pre-war levels, and the wounds were healed. At the beginning of this academic year, Soviet students received 106 million textbooks. If we change the words of Lomonosov, we can say that Soviet books are like a vast and bright river irrigating our country.
　　Many books have been published, but it is still not enough. We need more, better, and more needed books. No matter how great the success is, we cannot be satisfied. The country is racing against book production in cultural development. In addition, our readers have increased not only in number, but also in quality. In terms of textbooks alone, more than 4,000 kinds should be published in the post-war five-year plan. At the same time, the quality should also be improved, and the richest experience and innovative ideas of the Soviet Union should be comprehensively utilized.
　　Soviet readers demand a large number of high-quality artistic creations. There is also great interest in domestic politics, and a large amount of propaganda literature is needed in the socialist competition of various sectors of our people's economy. Books and pamphlets are needed to introduce the achievements of enterprise pioneers to popularize academics. Party and political education also need many reference books—everything is countless. One thing is clear: the printing industry stands at the center of all great political education work, and this work revolves around all Soviet citizens.
　　The large team of workers in our country's book publishing industry has contributed the richest abilities. Our colleges, universities, specialized schools, scientists, and writers' organizations have provided sufficient information to ensure the high quality of creations. There is also more and more paper, and the printing industry is specially equipped to perform this most complex task. Why is this? In order to make appropriate use of all the tools; because in the past, the education of domestic reactionary publishing workers proved that the huge book printing machines were not fully utilized, not rationally utilized, and sometimes even used for harmful things.
　　The publishing industries of the Kazakh, Armenian, and Uzbek republics have not completed their plans and are still lagging behind in publishing valuable works of Marxism-Leninism. Many publishing industries have hardly published a large number of pamphlets to make Soviet readers aware of the success of socialist construction and to inspire Soviet patriotic feelings. Some publishing industries have apparently forgotten that they are the formulators of theory and have issued some ideologically and aesthetically trivial things. The publishing undertakings of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, Ukraine and other allied republics, as well as the publishing undertaking of foreign literature, issued popular editions of the anti-scientific reactionary theory of biological Morganism.
　　This shows that the Communist Party members and Party organizations working in the printing industry have the responsibility to pay close attention to the actions of the publishing industry. Due attention has not been paid to the most important theoretical front. Bolshevik Party spirit is equally necessary in book publishing as it is in the publication of magazines or newspapers.
　　Some publishing houses publish books that are not needed at all. Some important works cannot be published, while some popular and vulgar books fill the shelves in the store and cannot be sold.
　　The publishing industry of the academy rarely takes care of the publication of general scientific literature books. This is still the solidified retention of the relationship of the class science's contempt for the masses of the people in the past, and this attitude should be ended now. Soviet science is the science of the people. It is not confined to its own small circle. It is actively sharing all the results with the masses.
　　People love books, so if books are published without love for them, it is an insult to Soviet readers. Poorly printed books, with errors, unclear text, bad type, stupid, unartistic, formalistic pictures and poorly bound books that fall apart with a little carelessness will certainly cause readers' anger. A Soviet book is often read by thousands of people, and it should be bound more firmly, especially when it is a mass communication reading material or textbook.
　　The culture of books is a great thing. Ilyich Lenin demanded a rigorous attitude towards the printing of works. Once, because the people who managed the publication were negligent in their work, Lenin proposed that they be sent to prison. The tools of culture, books, cannot be treated rudely.
　　Well-published books should be well disseminated. But our dissemination work is far from complete! Many books do not reach the places that need them—books are often piled up in places where they are not needed.
　　Improving all our publishing undertakings cannot be without the leadership and help of local Party organizations. Only under the constant supervision of the Party and the broad attention of Soviet society can our publishing undertakings carry out the enormous responsibilities placed before it. In our country, working in books for the people is considered a sacred job.

　　苏维埃书籍——社会主义的强大武器
    君强译
    由于国家书籍之丰富，我们可以判定它的文化程度。在这方面，全球的第一位是属于苏联的。我们出版的书比世界上任何国家都多，它不只在数量上，和资本主义国家出版的书籍不同，苏维埃书籍是贯穿着领导和进步的理论，它们是真正为人民的利益服务。苏维埃书籍，没有被某些出版物沾污过，象以迷信和神秘的毒素蒙蔽人民的意识，用卑俗犯罪的“文学”或其他碎屑使读者堕落等。但是这类的商品却在小商人气的资本主义国家出版界占据着第一位。
    在苏联，书籍的出版只是为了人民的政治、科学、艺术的教育，书是布尔什维克党的最重要的武器。斯大林同志说过：“我们要使所有的工人和农民成为有文化和受过教育的，到了现在，我们要作这件事。”因此，书籍的发行和传布的准备是理论前线最重要的一部份。
    我们在出版事业上的成功是伟大的，不可置辩的，在伟大的十月社会主义革命以前，村庄几乎完全不知道书籍。关于图书馆也一点不懂，现在村庄图书馆已将近五万，馆内书籍有四千万册以上。
    不仅发行的册数一一版数也增加了，在资本主义的书籍界不曾有过任何类似情形，也不可能有，列宁和斯大林作品集的数百版，足可以指出这种特质。此外在十年之间“联共（布）党史简明教程”在苏联，就发行了三千四百万册——这是前所未闻的现象！
    一九一七年以前俄罗斯书籍，除去少数例外，只有俄文版的，苏维埃联邦书籍却有一百种文字以上。这些语言之中，许多却只是列宁、斯大林的民族政治，才给了他们文字和文学。
    法西斯蒂德国侵略者，在他们所到的一切地方，毁掉了苏维埃书籍，他们烧了图书馆，打毁印刷机和造纸工厂……在那些沉重的日子，苏维埃人民冒着生命危险，瞒过敌人，保藏起印刷品来，象是对待苏维埃最珍贵的宝物。
    敌人给苏维埃的书籍印刷业带来了重大的破坏。在有些从希特勒匪帮解放了的地方，复兴起来的学校里没有教科书，没有任何印刷用具。布尔什维克党、苏维埃政府、整个苏维埃社会大众起来援助遭受苦难的共和国和州区。
    经过了一个短时期出版业就已达到战前水准，创伤治愈了。在今年学年开始时，苏维埃学生得到了一万万零六百万册教科书。如果把罗曼诺索夫的话改变一下，可以说苏维埃书籍象是广阔光明的河流灌溉着我们的国家。
    书籍出版了许多，但总还是不够。我们需要更大量的和最好的需要的书。不论成功是如何伟大，但却不能认为满足，国家在文化发展上是和书籍生产竞走的。此外，我们的读者不但在数量上增加了，而且问题也提高了。只就教科书一方面，在战后五年计划中，就应该出版四千种以上。同时质量方面也应提高，要综合利用苏维埃最丰富的经验和革新的思想。
    苏维埃读者要求大量出版高尚文学的艺术创作。对国内政治也有很大的兴趣，在我们人民经济的各部门的社会主义竞争方面也需要大量的宣传文学。书和小册子来介绍企业先锋的成就，以普及学术。党和政治教育也需要许多参考书——一切是数不胜数的，有一件事却是清析的：印刷事业是站在一切巨大的政治教育工作的中心，这工作围绕着所有的苏维埃公民。
    我国书籍出版事业工作者的大量队伍供献了最丰富的能力。我们的学院、大学、专门学校、科学家和作家组织给与了保证创作品质高尚的足够资料。纸也愈来愈多了，印刷业专门地被装备起来以执行这最繁复的任务。为什么这样呢？为了使一切工具的适当应用；因为在过去，国内反动出版业工作者的教育证明了巨大的书籍印刷机器没有整个被利用，没有合理的利用，而有时甚至用在有害的事情上。
    哈萨克、亚美尼亚和乌兹别克共和国的出版业没有完成计划，在出版马列主义有价值的文作上仍是落后的。许多出版业几乎没有发行过大量的小册子，使苏维埃读者认识社会主义建设的成功和启发苏维埃爱国主义感情。某些出版业显然地忘记了他们是理论的制定者，发行了一些观念政治的和美学的屑物。苏联科学院、乌克兰和别的加盟共和国的出版事业，还有外国文学的出版业，发行了普及本的反科学的生物学莫尔根主义的反动理论。
    这表示出在印刷界工作着的共产党员和党组织有责任深刻注意出版事业的行动。对于最重要的理论战线没有给与应该的注意。布尔什维克党性在书籍出版方面同样是必需的。和在杂志或报纸的发行上同样重要。
    某些发行所出版的书籍没有一点需要。一些重要作品不能出版，同时一些通俗平鄙的书，充满了店中的书架，找不到销路。
    学院的出版业对于一般的科学文学书籍的出版很少照顾得到。这还是从前阶级科学对人民大众的轻视关系的固留，现在应该结束这种态度。苏维埃科学是人民的科学，它并不拘限在自己的小圈子里，它是积极和大众共享一切成果的。
    人们都爱书籍，所以如果出版书籍而对它没有爱的话，那就是侮辱苏维埃的读者。印刷不好的书，有错误的、不清楚的、铅字坏的、有愚蠢的、不艺术的、形式主义的、图画的和装订得不好稍一不慎就散了的，这种包装当然会引起读者的愤怒。苏维埃的一本书常是有成千的人阅读，应当装订的坚固些，尤其当这书是大众传播读物或课本时。
    书籍的文化是件巨大的事情，伊里奇·列宁曾要求对作品的印刷要抱严谨的态度，有一次因为经营出版的人对工作疏忽，列宁曾提议把他们送入监狱去。文化的工具、书，是不能以粗野的态度对待的。
    出版了的很好的书，应当好好地传布它们。但是我们传布的工作离完成还远的很呢！许多书籍到不了需要他们的处所——书时常是堆积在没有需要的地方。
    改善我们一切出版事业，不能没有地方党组织的领导和帮助。只有在党的不断的监督和苏维埃社会广阔的注视下，我们的出版事业才能执行，摆在它面前的庞大责任，为了人民，在书籍方面的工作，在我国被认为是一项神圣的工作。
