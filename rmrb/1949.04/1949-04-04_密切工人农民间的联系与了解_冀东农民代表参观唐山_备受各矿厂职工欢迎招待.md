Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 3rd. To strengthen the ties and understanding between workers and peasants, peasants from Qian'an, Funing, Lulong, and Linyu counties in the Hebei Eastern District have selected over a hundred representatives to form a peasant visiting group to visit Tangshan City.

The peasant visiting group arrived in Tangshan on the 24th of last month and returned home on the 30th. During their week in Tangshan, the peasant representatives were warmly welcomed and received by workers from various mines and factories, as well as Party and government organizations. They were also invited to visit various mines and factories in Tangshan City. At a forum jointly convened on the 26th by the CPC Hebei Eastern District Committee, the Hebei Eastern District Administrative Office, the Hebei Eastern District Military Region Headquarters, the Tangshan City Military Control Commission, and the Tangshan CPC Municipal Committee, peasant representatives and worker representatives exchanged many opinions on how to cooperate in building their country in the future, how rural areas can supply the cities with needed grain and industrial raw materials, and how cities can supply rural areas with daily necessities. The meeting was filled with the spirit of worker-peasant unity.

Worker representatives said, "Without the grain supplied by our peasant brothers, the workers would have no food, and without the cotton from the countryside, the yarn factories would have to close." A worker representative from an iron factory said, "We are researching the manufacture and improvement of agricultural tools for the use of our peasant brothers." The peasant representatives unanimously praised the worker brothers, saying, "The workers are our elder brothers and should help us and lead us to improve technology and spread machines to the countryside." A young peasant representative from Qingping County said, "When I think of the benefits of the Soviet Union using machines to reclaim land and plant crops, I even dream of such a day when I sleep." The peasants also described their arduous struggles and efforts to support the war during the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan and the two-year-plus War of Liberation, which greatly moved the workers.

After visiting the various mines and factories, the peasant representatives more keenly appreciated the hard work, diligence, courage, determination, and organization of the workers. They unanimously stated: after returning, they must plant crops better, produce more grain, and grow more cotton to meet the needs of urban industry.
