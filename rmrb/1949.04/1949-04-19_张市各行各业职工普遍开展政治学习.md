　　Zhangjiakou News: The cultural and educational work among workers in Zhangjiakou City has greatly developed in February and March. After the first liberation of Zhangjiakou (1945), the workers already had a considerable level of political awareness. After this liberation, they urgently demanded to study. In March, with the efforts of the Party and the trade union, and with the help of the factory administration, spare-time schools were established in various factories, and study committees were organized. Political study has been universally launched, and the study of "carrying the revolution through to the end" and the current situation is generally the most in-depth. The study of the documents of the Labor University, various basic policies, and a brief history of social development has also been launched successively. Under the leadership of the district offices, various private industries have organized seven training classes according to different industries. Through the study, workers have initially understood the Party's economic policies, which has enabled the wage issue to be resolved smoothly. Recreational activities have also become active at the same time. Eleven clubs have been set up, with books, magazines, newspapers, balls, musical instruments, drama troupes, singing teams, and music teams being relatively complete. In the past, workers would wander around after work, causing petty factionalism and disunity. Now they have proper entertainment, and after work, they all go to the clubs to read books and sing songs. They have become interested in learning, and unity has been gradually strengthened. Communication and writing work has also been slowly established. The Telecommunications Bureau developed and organized twenty-five communication groups in February and March, totaling one hundred and forty-seven correspondents. They are writing articles for newspapers, and compiling blackboards and wall newspapers within the factory with great enthusiasm.

　　张市各行各业职工普遍开展政治学习
    【张家口讯】二、三月份张市职工文教工作有很大开展。张市经过第一次（一九四五年）解放，职工在政治上已有相当觉悟。这次解放后，迫切要求学习。三月份，在党与工会的努力与工厂行政的帮助下，各厂设立了业余学校，组织了学习委员会。政治学习已普遍展开，“将革命进行到底”和目前形势的学习一般最为深入。劳大文件、各种基本政策、社会发展简史的学习也都相继展开。各私营行业在区办事处的领导下，根据不同行业，举办了七个训练班。在学习中工人已初步了解了党的经济政策，使工资问题得到顺利解决。文娱工作同时也活跃起来。俱乐部搞起了十一处，其中书籍杂志报纸、球类、乐器以及话剧团、歌咏队、音乐队设置相当齐全，过去职工们下班后到处游逛、闹小派别不团结，现在有了正当娱乐，一下班就都到俱乐部看书唱歌，学习有了兴趣，团结已日渐加强。通讯写作工作也慢慢建立起来。电信局二、三月份发展组织通讯组二十五个，计一百四十七个通讯员。给报社写稿，在厂内编写黑板报墙报等，搞得非常起劲。
