　　North China People's Government Ministry of Justice
  　Answers Questions on Marriage Policy

    On April 6th, a special correspondent from this newspaper visited Director Wang of the First Division of the Ministry of Justice of the North China People's Government to answer questions on marriage policy. Fourteen questions were raised, and Director Wang answered them comprehensively in three major areas:

    Q: Does polygamy constitute bigamy?
    A: The People's Government decrees strictly prohibit the backward practice of polygamy. However, regarding the "established facts" left over from the old society, in order to take care of the woman's current life, we generally do not force them to divorce. If any woman voluntarily requests a divorce, the man must not interfere, and the government should approve it immediately. After the establishment of the People's Democratic Government, any further occurrence of polygamy will be subject to legal punishment.

    Q: Regarding children after divorce, who should have custody?
    A: Article 21 of the Marriage Regulations of the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region stipulates: "Children born before the divorce of a man and a woman, those under the age of four shall be raised by the woman after the divorce, and those over the age of four shall be raised by the man. If there is another agreement, that agreement shall be followed. However, if the woman has not remarried and is unable to maintain her livelihood, the man shall provide the woman with living expenses for raising the children until the woman remarries." Article 22: "Children brought by a woman after remarriage shall be jointly responsible for raising by the woman and her new husband." Furthermore, Article 14, Paragraph 1 of the Implementing Rules of the former Marriage Regulations: "Children of four years of age, if the man is not suitable for raising them, shall still be raised by the woman; children under four years of age, if the woman is not suitable for raising them, may be raised by the man." Paragraph 2: "If both parties refuse or compete for custody of the children, the children shall be assigned to the party with suitable conditions for raising them." Before the promulgation of unified North China marriage regulations, the above provisions may be referred to for implementation. In short, the principle is to raise the children to adulthood.

    Q: What should be done if one party requests a divorce and the other party does not agree?
    A: If a husband and wife have irreconcilable differences and one party requests a divorce while the other party does not agree, the judicial organs must analyze and study the crux of the dispute and conduct appropriate mediation. During the mediation, any incorrect thoughts or behaviors of either party should be given appropriate education and criticism, or a deadline for correcting errors should be set. If the parties are willing, a divorce should not be decreed if it can be avoided. If the conditions for cohabitation no longer exist in reality, a divorce should still be decreed even if one party does not agree.

　　华北人民政府司法部
  　答有关婚姻政策诸问题
    四月六日，本报派专人前往华北人民政府司法部，专访第一处王处长，解答有关婚姻政策中诸问题，共提出十四个问题，蒙王处长综合三大问题分别答复如下：
    问：一夫多妻制，是否犯重婚罪？
    答：人民政府法令，对落后的一夫多妻制，是严厉禁止的；但对旧社会遗留下来的“既成事实”，为了照顾女方的当前生活，一般是不迫令他们离婚，如果任何女方自愿提出离婚，男方不得加以干涉，政府应即批准。人民民主政府成立后，再发生一夫多妻制的罪行，应受法律处分。
    问：离婚后的小孩问题，应归谁抚养？
    答：查晋冀鲁豫边区婚姻条例第二十一条：“男女离婚前，所生之子女，离婚后未满四周岁者，由女方抚养，已满四周岁者，应由男方抚养，其另有约定者，应从其约定。但如女方未再婚时，无力维持生活者，男方需给女方抚养子女之生活费，至女方再婚时止。”第二十二条：“女子再婚后所带之子女由女方及新夫共同负责抚养。”又前婚姻条例施行细则第十四条第一款：“四周岁之子女，如男方不适合教养者，仍归女方教养，四周岁以下之子女，如女方不适合教养者，得归男方。”第二款：“双方拒绝或争索教养子女者，判归有适合教养条件之一方。”在统一的华北婚姻条例未颁布前，上述规定均可参照执行，总之以教养小孩成人为原则。
    问：一方提出离婚，一方不同意如何办？
    答：夫妻感情不合，一方提出离婚，一方又不同意，司法机关须依据双方争执的症结点，加以分析研究，适当的进行调解，在调解中对于任何一方不正确的思想行为，给以适当的教育与批评，或订定改正错误的限期，在双方自愿之下，能够不离的就不应判决离婚，如事实上已构成不能同居的条件，即使一方不同意，仍应判决离婚。
