　　Syria—An Arab country in southwestern Asia. It has an area of 57,900 square miles and a population of over 3.91 million (1943 statistics). It is an agricultural country, rich in wheat and tropical fruits. After World War I, it became a League of Nations mandated territory under French rule. On June 8, 1941, Allied forces entered Syria to prevent Hitler from invading the Middle East. In September of the same year, France hypocritically declared Syria's independence. After World War II, the French army not only did not withdraw immediately, but also increased its troops to Syria and Lebanon in 1945. As a result, the Syrian people launched a nationwide struggle for independence, striving for the withdrawal of British and French troops in 1946. Now, American imperialism is carrying out expansion everywhere, and its plunder of Middle Eastern oil is even more frantic. Syria is the only way for Iranian and Iraqi oil to reach the sea, so American aggression is intensifying.

　　Middle East Oil Pipeline—Starting from Kirkuk, the oil production center of Iraq, it branches into two not far to the west at Haditha in Iraq. One line passes through Syria and Lebanon to Tripoli, a port on the Mediterranean Sea. The other line passes through Transjordan and Palestine to Haifa, a Mediterranean port south of Tripoli. Collectively known as the Middle East Oil Pipeline, it is 1,176 miles long. It was built by Britain and France starting in 1932 to facilitate the plunder of Iranian and Iraqi oil and was completed in 1935.

    叙利亚——亚洲西南部阿拉伯国家之一。面积五万七千九百方哩，人口三百九十一万余人（一九四三年统计）。是一个农业国，盛产小麦及热带果品。第一次世界大战后，成为国联委任统治地，委托法国统治。一九四一年六月八日盟国军队为防范希特拉侵入中东而开进叙利亚，同年九月法国曾虚伪地宣布叙利亚独立。第二次世界大战结束后，法国军队不但不即时撤退，而且在一九四五年增兵到叙利亚与黎巴嫩，因此叙利亚人民曾掀起了全国范围的独立斗争，争取英法军队于一九四六年撤退。现在，美帝国主义到处实行扩张，对中东石油的掠夺更为疯狂，叙利亚既是伊朗、伊拉克石油出海的必经之路，美国的侵略就日益加剧。
