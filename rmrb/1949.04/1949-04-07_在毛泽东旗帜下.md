Under the Banner of Mao Zedong
　　Guo Moruo

　　Today's young friends are fortunate, and I sincerely wish you well.

　　For many years, I have been dreaming: all young friends should develop freely, without restraint, without worry, just like a forest in the free air, with sufficient sunlight and air, sufficient nutrition and moisture, naturally growing into solid trees, pillars of society. Today, this dream can be fully realized very quickly.

　　The reactionary forces that bind our youth, enslave our youth, and slaughter our youth—the alliance of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism—will soon be completely defeated by us in large-scale military operations. The Chinese people have turned over a new leaf, and Chinese youth have also gotten rid of all shackles and handcuffs, and can live happily ever after.

　　Young people are born in such a great era of new history, it is truly worthy of blessings. We must not fail this era, and we must not be intoxicated by the joy of happiness. We should maintain full clarity, calmness, friendship, and courage to understand and complete the historical mission of youth.

　　How to understand and complete one's own mission? To sincerely accept the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, study Marxism-Leninism, study Mao Zedong Thought, experience the various policies and calls of the Chinese Communist Party, and establish a strong revolutionary outlook on life, this is the only way, and it is the way that everyone must experience. With this foundation, we can have a healthy soul, we can master various technologies, and truly serve the people.

　　Whether it is spiritual production or material production, technology is of course necessary, but the person who uses the technology is still a human being. If the user is not healthy, the more sophisticated the technology being used, the greater the harm it will cause. Therefore, one must be a revolutionary before one can master revolutionary technology, and one must have a thorough understanding of the people before one can become a loyal servant of the people.

　　These words should have become revolutionary common sense today. Especially young friends may all know it, and know it very thoroughly. But knowing it is not enough, we must also ask us to do it. Not only to do it, but also to do it well. This is not an easy task. Let us work hard for a lifetime, and we don’t have to do it just right.

　　In short, let us work hard. Don't be exaggerated, and don't be discouraged, let us work hard in a pragmatic way. Work hard to study, work hard to experience, work hard to work, not only to carry the revolutionary war to the end, but also to truly shoulder the sacred mission of building a new democratic China. To make the construction of new democracy rapidly achieve victory and rapidly transition to the stage of socialist construction.

　　Today's young friends are fortunate, and I sincerely wish you well. Today there is already a very good objective environment for you to develop freely, you must not fail this era, you should work harder. With a good objective environment, there must be a good subjective effort to cooperate with it. Let us forever advance bravely under the banner of Mao Zedong.

　　在毛泽东旗帜下
    郭沫若
    今天的青年朋友们幸福了，我诚恳地向你们祝福。
    很多年辰以来，我就作着这样的梦想：凡是青年朋友都应该无拘无束、无忧无虑、自由自在地发展下去，就象自由空气里面的森林那样，有充分的阳光和空气，充分的养料和水分，自然而然地长成为磐磐大木，栋梁之材。今天这梦想，竟很快地便可以全部实现了。
    束缚我们青年，奴化我们青年，屠杀我们青年的反动势力——帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义的联军，在大规模的军事行动上很快便要整个被我们击溃了。中国人民来了一个大翻身，中国青年也从此脱掉一切的脚镣手铐，可以畅畅快快的做人了。
    青年们生在这样的新历史开幕的大时代，真是值得祝福。我们千万不要辜负了这个时代，千万不要在幸福的欢乐中陶醉了自己，应该保持着十分的清明、沉着、友爱、勇敢，来认识并完成青年所负的历史使命。
    怎样来认识和完成自己的使命呢？诚心诚意地接受中国共产党的领导，学习马列主义，学习毛泽东思想，体验中国共产党的各种政策和号召，建立一个坚强的革命的人生观，这是唯一的途径，而且是每一个人所必须经历的途径。有了这种基础，然后我们才能具备一个健全的灵魂，我们才能掌握得到各种技术，而切实地为人民服务。
    无论是精神生产也好，物价生产也好，技术自然是必须的，然而运用技术的还是人。运用者如不健全，则被运用的技术，愈精巧时害人的成分愈大。故必须是革命家，然后才能掌握革命的技术，必须有彻底的人民意识者，然后才能成为忠实的人民勤务员。
    这些话在今天，应该是已经成为革命的常识了。尤其青年朋友们可能个个都知道，而且知道得很透熟。但知道了并不能算事，一定还得要求我们做到。不仅是做到，而且还须得做好。这却不是容易的事。就让我们一辈子努力做去，都不必一定做得恰到好处。
    总之，我们努力吧。不要浮夸，也不必气馁，我们实事求是地努力吧。努力学习，努力体验，努力工作，不仅要将革命战争进行到底，而且要把建设新民主主义的新中国这种神圣的使命，切实地担负起来。使新民主主义的建设迅速地得到胜利，迅速地过渡到社会主义建设的阶段。
    今天的青年朋友们幸福了，我诚恳地向你们祝福。今天已经有了很好的客观环境让你们自由发展，你们千万不要辜负了这个时代，应该加倍的努力。有了很好的客观环境，必须有很好的主观努力和它配合。我们永远地在毛泽东的旗帜之下奋勇前进吧。
