[Report from Central Hebei] Anguo is organizing drought resistance and planting of cash crops, and has broken through key villages to gain important experience. In order to boost the planting of cash crops, the County Party Committee organized four work teams to go deep into various districts. The work team that arrived at Xibaizhang, a key cotton-planting village in the Fifth District, encountered the first problem: village cadres raised the issue that "it is impossible to plant without rain in such a drought." The work team immediately held a meeting on the night of the ninth, which was composed of twenty-one village cadres and veteran farmers. They believed that the only way was to fetch water for planting. But what about places far from the well? They said that water could be transported by carts. Depending on the strength of the livestock, a large cart could pull two or three large buckets, and five or six carts of water would be enough to plant one mu of land. The labor shortage could be overcome by organizing women and children, who could all carry water to irrigate the land. In places too far from the water well, the villagers were mobilized to dig wells, digging several wells in a row to ensure enough water. After solving the above problems, everyone felt it was important to find ways to make the seeds germinate as soon as possible. According to everyone's review, in the past, there was not enough research on soil quality. For example, in small red clay soil, deep ditches were dug, and seeds were sown first, then watered, which often glued the seeds and made them difficult to germinate. Everyone believed that an effective method was to rake the soil well, use a rake to make shallow ditches, dig pits, water the pits, and after an hour or two, turn the soil with an iron hoe, sprinkle the seeds, and push back and forth with a hoe to make it easy to germinate. Because the ditches were shallow and the soil covering was thin, the result of watering before sowing was that the wet soil was pressed underneath, which was not easy to dry and drought-resistant, and would not stick to the seeds. Everyone believed that these methods were specific and effective, enough to make farmers believe. As a result of the publicity, the farmers in the whole village broke the idea of "relying on the weather" and laid the foundation for overcoming the drought, actively taking action.

    [Another dispatch] Farmers in the Fifth District of Ba County are joining forces to dig wells and plant cotton. Nanmeng Village has already dug seventeen earthen wells. After digging six brick wells in Dongyan Village, they sent people to various villages to buy bricks in preparation for digging more. Li Jiaying originally had twenty-six wells, and the Farmers' Association plans to dig thirty-six more, of which eight have already been dug. Xiwuying originally had one hundred and seven brick wells, and plans to dig thirty more. These efforts will greatly reduce the difficulties caused by the drought. However, some farmers are still waiting for rain, relying on the weather, and are currently being educated.

    [Another dispatch] The Anguo County Party Committee's work team gained new publicity experience in Xibaizhang Village, which promoted farmers to grow more cotton and peanuts. At the beginning of entering the village, the work team made rooftop broadcasts and wrote wall newspapers, and then went deep into the farmers to listen to their feedback, and found that the publicity effect was not very good. Because those who were illiterate did not read the wall newspapers, and some people did not understand the broadcast, people still had some concerns about growing cotton. Then, according to the farmers' concerns, explanations were made in a question-and-answer format on the rooftop broadcasting station. For example, question: What will you grow more of this year? Answer: More cotton and peanuts. Question: If you grow more cotton and peanuts, what about paying public grain? Answer: The North China People's Government has announced that one catty of cotton can be worth eight catties of millet... Question: What if you can't sell the cotton and peanuts? Answer: We have big cities and factories so big, no matter how much there is, it can be sold; besides, some places don't produce cotton, how can it not be sold? Question: What if we don't have grain to eat if we only grow cotton and peanuts? Answer: If you turn cotton and peanuts into money, you can buy anything. The Northeast is so big, it produces a lot of grain, the trains are already running, and there is plenty of grain... With this kind of publicity, farmers can easily accept it. Therefore, the land planned by farmers in the village to grow cash crops has reached 28 percent of the total land area. Experience has proven that as long as we have a deep understanding of the farmers' psychology and educate them in various ways, the plan to grow cash crops will definitely be completed.

### 县委深入领导防旱  安国组织点种棉花  工作组突破重点村取得经验

　　县委深入领导防旱
  　安国组织点种棉花
  　工作组突破重点村取得经验
    【冀中讯】安国组织防旱点种经济作物工作，已突破重点村而取得重要经验。为突击种植经济作物，县委曾组织四个工作组分头深入各区。到达五区种棉重点村——西柏章的工作组，碰到的第一个问题是村干部提出的“天旱不雨没法下种”。工作组立即于九日夜间开会讨论，会议系由二十一个村干部与老农组成。他们认为只有弄水点种。但是，离井远的地方怎么办呢？他们说，可以用大车拉水。看牲口强弱，一辆大车能拉二至三个大桶，有五、六车水，足可点种一亩。劳力的困难可组织妇女、儿童来克服，他们都能抬水浇地。在离水井过远的地方，则发动挖井，一连挖上几眼，以保证水量够用。在解决了上述问题之后，大家认为设法使种籽早日发芽，有重要意义。据大家检讨，过去研究土质不够，比方小红胶泥地，挑沟深，又先撒种，后浇水，往往把种籽黏住不易发芽。大家认为有效的办法是把土耙好，用耧挑成浅沟，挖好坑，用水浇坑，过一两点钟，用铁铣把土翻一下，撒上种，用锄推个来回，就容易发芽。因为沟浅，盖的土薄，先浇后种的结果，把湿土压在下面，既不易干，耐旱，又粘不住种籽。大家认为这些办法具体而有效，足以使农民相信。经过宣传的结果，全村农民打破了“靠天吃饭”的思想，奠定了战胜天旱的信心，积极行动起来。　　　　（张步胜）
    【又讯】霸县五区农民纷纷合伙打井种棉。南孟村已打好十七眼土井。东岩村在打好六眼砖井以后，又派人到各村买砖，准备再打。李家营原有二十六眼井，农会计划再打三十六眼。已打好八眼。西务营原有一百零七眼砖井，计划再打三十眼。这些工作将大大减少天旱给予的困难。但仍有一些农民专等下雨，靠天吃饭，现正教育中。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　                   （刘志远）
    【又讯】安国县委工作组在西伯章村获得新的宣传经验，推动了农民多种棉花、花生。进村之初，工作组作了屋顶广播，写了壁报，接着又深入到农民中听取反映，发现宣传效果不很好。因为不识字的不看壁报，广播又有些人听不懂，人们依然对种棉有好些顾虑。又根据农民的顾虑，在屋顶广播台上用问答方式作了解释。比方，问：今年多种什么？对方答：多种棉花、花生。问：多种棉花、花生，缴公粮怎么办？答：华北人民政府已经公布，每斤棉花能顶八斤小米……问：多种棉花卖不了怎么办？答：我们有了大城市，工厂那么大，有多少也卖得了；再说，有些地方不出棉花，怎么卖不了呢？问：光种棉花、花生没粮食吃怎么办？答：有棉花、花生变了钱，什么也能买到。东北那么大的地方，产粮食可多哩，火车已经通开，粮食多得很。……这样宣传，农民很易接受。故该村农民计划种经济作物的土地，已达土地总数的百分之二十八。经验证明，只要深入了解农民心理，用各种方法向农民进行教育，种植经济作物的计划一定会完成的。
