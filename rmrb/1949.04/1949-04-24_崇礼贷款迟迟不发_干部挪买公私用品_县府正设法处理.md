　　Chongli Loan Delayed
  　Cadres Misappropriate Funds for Public and Private Use
  　County Government is Working on a Solution
    [Chahar News] The improper use of livestock loans in Chongli County has caused great losses to the people. According to the plan, after the county received 400,000 yuan (RMB) in loans from the Special Commissioner's Office in January this year, if the old agricultural loans could be recovered in time, it was estimated that 200 heads of draught animals could be purchased in Duolun at that time. However, the county not only failed to issue new loans and recover old loans in a timely manner, but also put the 400,000 yuan on hold for more than a month. Moreover, Deng Bo, the head of the Industry and Commerce Section, and the deputy secretary of the county party committee, while the county magistrate was attending a meeting at the Special Commissioner's Office, privately advocated using the loan to buy cloth in Beiping and then exchanging the cloth for livestock. Liang Shufang, a clerk from the Industry and Commerce Section who was sent to Beiping to buy cloth, also used the loan without authorization to buy newspapers, basketballs, kerosene and other public goods, as well as bed sheets, leather bags, and milk substitutes for private use, totaling 91,681 yuan. After learning about this, the People's Bank's cadre stationed in Chongli immediately went to question Deng and ask for purchase procedures. Deng refused to provide them. The bank comrade immediately went to the Special Commissioner's Office to report to the county magistrate, who in turn reported to the Special Commissioner's Office. Deng Bo not only did not review his actions on this matter, but also said that the county magistrate had "individual heroism" and a "undemocratic work style." Finally, after a discussion at the county government's political affairs meeting, Deng Bo realized his mistake. The meeting decided to first sell five horses of the county government to make up for the misappropriated loan, and then pursue individual loans. Due to the delay and misuse of loans, only more than 40 heads of livestock can be purchased at present.

　　崇礼贷款迟迟不发
  　干部挪买公私用品
  　县府正设法处理
    【察哈尔讯】崇礼县运用牲畜贷款不当，人民受到极大损失。按该县今年一月接到专署拨给的四十万元（人民币，下同）贷款后，如能再及时催收旧农贷，估计当时可去多伦买耕畜二百头。但该县不但未及时发放新贷与催收旧贷，反把四十万元搁置了一个多月，而且实业科长邓波与县委副书记又在县长去专署开会之际，私自主张以此贷款去北平买布，再以布换回牲口。派往北平买布的实业科员梁树芳等，又擅用贷款买了报纸、篮球、煤油等公用物品，以及为私人购买被面、皮包、代乳粉等，共动用贷款达九万一千六百八十一元之多。人民银行驻崇礼干部闻讯后，立即前往质问、要购货手续，邓推托不给，银行同志随即去专署报告该县县长，转报专署。邓波对此事不但不作检讨，反说县长有“个人英雄主义”，“作风不民主”。最后经县府政务会议讨论后，邓波才认识到错误。会议决定先以县府五匹马卖掉，补起挪用贷款，之后追要个人贷款。由于拖延和滥用贷款，结果目前只能买到四十多头牲口。
