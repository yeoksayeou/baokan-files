[Jinzhong News] The Shouyang branch discovered unexpected losses in March when clearing grain loans in the fifth district. The original loan of rice in the fifth district was 100,935.5 jin. At that time, the credit cooperative relied on district and village cadres for loans. The credit cooperative's oversight was lax, and it did not examine the objects and uses of the loans. Instead, it blindly let go without inspection, resulting in the abuse of grain loans, mostly for relief. In terms of procedures, borrowers did not sign agreements; instead, village cadres signed a general agreement. Due to the district and village cadres' simple task-oriented perspective and the belief that it was relief, once the loans were given out, they were considered done, and there was no repayment or collection at maturity. After clearing, it was discovered that district cadres in the fifth district had abused grain loans. For example, Secretary Han Zhenchang and others each borrowed 160 jin of rice, and other district cadres borrowed a total of 1,133 jin of rice. Han Zhenchang also misappropriated the grain loans without going through the credit cooperative, lending 110 jin of rice to Yin Xirui, a veteran in Taiping Village, and 100 jin of rice to Pan Lafu, a cadre in Taiping Village, for his wedding. The grain committee of Yao'na Village also fabricated false names and occupied an extra 583 jin of loan rice and 120 jin of small beans, saying that they "provided relief to the poor and hired laborers." For example, Ding Binggong, the chief treasurer of Longtan Village, and others used 701.4 jin of loan grain to pay public grain. After verification with each household, 436.3 jin were found, and the remaining 265.1 jin were eaten.

　　寿阳五区干部滥用贷粮
    【晋中讯】寿阳支行三月份在五区清理贷粮时，发现受了意外损失。五区原贷米十万零九千九百三十五点五斤，当时信用部是依靠区、村干部出贷，信用部掌握松懈，也未审查对象及用途，盲目放手不作检查，结果滥用贷粮，大部用于救济；手续上贷户也不立约，由村干部立一总约。由于区、村干部的单纯任务观点和认为是救济，放出去就算，到期也不还也不催收。经过清理，发现五区区干部有滥用贷粮现象，如秘书韩振昌等，每人贷米一百六十斤，连其他区干部共贷米一千一百三十三斤，韩振昌并擅自动用贷粮，不通过信用部，借给太平村荣誉军人尹喜瑞米一百一十斤，太平村干部潘拉富结婚也借给一百斤。窑垴村粮委并捏造假名多占贷米五百八十三斤，小豆一百二十斤，说是“救济了贫雇”，又如龙潭村总财粮丁丙公等，将贷粮七百零一点四斤，交了公粮，经各户对证找出四百三十六点三斤，余二百六十五点一斤吃了。
