    Sand Casting—is a common method used in general factories to manufacture parts. First, a model of the part to be made is created using hardwood. The model is placed in a sand box (the sand should be slightly moist) and pressure is applied. Then, the model is removed. Molten iron or copper is poured in, and after it solidifies, it becomes the required part. This process is called sand casting.
    Repair and Maintenance—is part of the work of the construction and maintenance department of a factory, specializing in the repair of all factory buildings, structures, work equipment, and office furniture.
    Distilled Water—is water that has been distilled. It is clear, colorless, and pure, with no impurities. It is used for chemical experiments and pharmaceutical manufacturing, etc. Distillation is commonly done with a distiller. Water is placed in a flask (a heat-resistant glass bottle), heated to boiling, and turned into steam. The steam passes through a condenser (a double-layered glass tube, with the steam passing through the inner layer and cold water flowing through the outer layer). The water that comes out is distilled water.

    翻砂—是一般工厂里通常用以制造零件的方法。首先将要制的零件用坚木制成模型，把模型置于砂箱（砂应稍带潮湿）中，加以压力，然后取出模型。再将铁水或铜水倒入，凝结后，即成为所需之零件。这个过程谓之翻砂。
