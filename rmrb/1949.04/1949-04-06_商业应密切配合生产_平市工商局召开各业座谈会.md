Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 5th. The Beiping Municipal People's Government Industry and Commerce Bureau convened a symposium on the morning of the 3rd in the Chamber of Commerce auditorium, gathering more than 250 representatives from over 120 industry associations across the city. Cheng Hongyi, Director of the Industry and Commerce Bureau, elaborated in detail on the New Democratic economic program and the People's Government's policy towards industry and commerce, and pointed out the path that Beiping's industry and commerce should take in the future. Director Cheng pointed out that the People's Government's policy of protecting industry and commerce is clear. All economic activities that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood, and that comply with policies and laws, will be allowed to operate and develop freely by the government, and will also be protected and assisted. However, the government will certainly sanction the speculative activities, financial disruptions, or illegal trading and smuggling and tax evasion of a small number of unscrupulous merchants, because these actions are detrimental to the interests of the people. Director Cheng then put forward three suggestions, requiring the business community to pay close attention to them in the future: 1. The business community should closely cooperate with the task of restoring and developing production in Beiping, that is, under the guidance of the government, cooperate with national trade organizations to supply raw materials to industry and handicrafts and promote the sale of finished products, and exchange urban and rural materials according to the needs of the people. A small number of industries that are experiencing difficulties due to not meeting the needs of the people can find ways to switch to production. 2. As for the legitimate demands of the workers, such as the demand to ensure the necessary living standards, organize trade unions, not to be dismissed without reason, abolish abuse and beatings of workers, and clear wage arrears, as long as the capitalists and shop employees discuss well, they can be resolved. If disputes arise that cannot be resolved, the government will mediate or arbitrate based on the principle of developing production and benefiting both labor and capital. 3. In the past, the Chamber of Commerce handled affairs for the Kuomintang reactionary government and apportioned donations and taxes, which was extremely unfair; in the future, the Chamber of Commerce should handle affairs impartially in accordance with the policies of the People's Government, frequently inform the government of the opinions of merchants, and effectively convey the government's policies and laws to all merchants, large and small. Director Cheng called on everyone to operate with peace of mind, to strive for the rapid restoration and development of Beiping's production, and to work hard to build a new Beiping.

　　商业应密切配合生产
  　平市工商局召开各业座谈会
    【新华社北平五日电】北平市人民政府工商局，三日上午在商会大礼堂，召集全市一百二十余行业公会的代表二百五十余人举行座谈。工商局程宏毅局长于会上详细阐述新民主主义的经济纲领和人民政府的工商业政策，并且指出北平工商业今后应走的道路。程局长指出：人民政府保护工商业政策是明确的。凡有利于国计民生、遵守政策法令的经济活动，政府均允许其自由经营和发展，并且还加以保护和帮助。但少数奸商的投机倒把、扰乱金融，或经营非法买卖、走私漏税等不法行为，政府必予以制裁，因为这些行为有损于人民的利益。程局长继即提出三点意见，要求商业界今后切实注意：一、商业界应密切配合恢复和发展北平市生产的任务，即在政府的指导下，配合国家贸易机关，为工业和手工业供给原料和推销成品，根据人民的需要交流城乡物资，少数因不合人民需要而经营困难的行业，可设法转到生产事业方面。二、对于职工们的正当要求，如要求保障必要的生活水准、组织工会、不得无故解雇、废除虐待打骂工人及清偿工资积欠等，只要资方与店员工人很好地商量，是能够解决的。如果发生争议不能解决，政府当本发展生产、劳资两利的方针予以调解或仲裁。三、过去商会替国民党反动政府办事，摊派捐税，极不公平；今后商会应按人民政府政策秉公办事，经常把商户意见告诉政府，把政府的政策法令切实传达给大小商户。程局长号召大家安心经营，为迅速恢复和发展北平的生产，为建设新北平而努力。
