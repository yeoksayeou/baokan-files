　　Shijiazhuang Workers' Production Increase Competition
    Kang Weizhong
    For over a year since liberation, the awareness and enthusiasm of Shijiazhuang workers have been continuously improving. During the preparations for war last winter, the working class demonstrated a high degree of labor enthusiasm and creativity. Many factories achieved remarkable results in completing their resumption of work plans. This is the foundation upon which Shijiazhuang's production increase and loss compensation competition was launched.
    On November 20th last year, the Municipal Party Committee issued a call for state-owned enterprises throughout the city to launch a production competition. After thorough mobilization by the factory's Party, administration, and trade union, and relying on the workers' high enthusiasm, factories successively joined the heated competition movement.
    The companies participating in this competition included Yumin Industrial Company, Qianjin Factory, Daxing Yarn Factory, the Telephone Bureau, Northern Printing Bureau, Zhenxing Industrial Company, the Waterworks, and factories under the North China Industrial Company. After more than two months, the competition achieved significant results: First, both output and quality improved, and all factories completed and exceeded their competition plans ahead of schedule. The Telephone Bureau repaired 1,000 automatic telephones in ten days; the Qianjin Factory's vehicle workshop originally planned to overhaul 76 passenger and freight cars in one and a half months, but completed it one month and one day ahead of schedule; it originally took the Daxing Yarn Factory's maintenance department seven days to install a spinning frame, but after liberation it took five days, and during the competition it was completed in just two and a half days. Before the competition, Yumin Industrial Company's weaving factory produced 22 bolts of white cloth, 20 yards per day; during the competition, the daily output increased to 27 bolts, 24 yards, an increase of more than 11%. Not only was there an increase in quantity, but there were also considerable achievements in caring for equipment and saving raw materials. For example, the glass department of Yumin Industrial Company's chemical plant used a combination of potassium dichromate, antimony sulfide, and manganese dioxide to manufacture yellow glass before the war preparations; each can of chemicals cost 3,500 yuan (People's Currency). After Xu Zhenghua, the department director, researched and used brown sugar, activated carbon, and a small amount of sulfur as substitutes, the quality of the yellow glass produced was not reduced, and the cost of each can of chemicals was reduced by 2,000 yuan (People's Currency). Although the ice factory used the same amount of materials as before when producing ammonia, the output more than doubled, and the quality was also better than before.
    During the competition, workers demonstrated a high degree of creativity: During the short one-and-a-half-month competition period, Qianjin Factory had no fewer than 80 technical improvements and inventions; Li Xiaowu, a worker in the forging workshop, created the "self-locking chain" manufacturing method, which increased productivity threefold; Xu Zhenghua of Yumin Industrial Company's glass department carefully researched and used air tubes to replace manual bottle blowing, which saved labor and increased output sixfold. These creations and inventions played a huge role in the production increase movement.
    During this competition, many heroes, models, and glorious deeds emerged. At the beginning of the competition, Wu Guirong and eighteen other young workers from the Qianjin Factory's decoration workshop formed a shock team, and after completing their own work, they also helped others to catch up. At the beginning of the competition in the Northern Printing Bureau's second factory's lead printing unit, the bureau stipulated that workers' voluntary overtime should not be too long in order to protect their health; however, they voluntarily went to work early, which increased the operating time of the lead printing unit's machines.
    Comrade Liu Xiufeng of the CPC Shijiazhuang Municipal Committee gave a detailed analysis of the reasons for this achievement at the summary meeting. He said: "This is primarily due to the workers' high labor enthusiasm and increased class consciousness. A production competition movement can only be launched in a country where the factory is under the leadership of the proletariat, because the workers understand that the development of the factory is closely related to their own interests. Secondly, this competition movement was launched in a planned way, which means that this credit should also be given to the plans and leadership of our workers' representatives—the trade union, administrative personnel, and technical personnel—in combination with the workers' production enthusiasm, so that the competition movement can be launched enthusiastically. Therefore, this competition movement is a planned, led, and conscious mass movement. Third, we prevented the tendency of emphasizing quantity over quality. Fourth, in ideological leadership, we paid attention to preventing 'hero prominence.' We often use the combination of individual models and collective models to educate our workers, so that the workers can unite more closely in production. Fifth, it is best to have rewards for the competition. Rewards should be universal, but they should also have levels, and only competitions with rewards can be sustained. Sixth, we must pay attention to different factories and different conditions, and use different methods to launch this movement. We cannot force uniformity. For example, those that cannot increase output can start from improving technology, saving raw materials, and reducing costs."
    What have we learned in this competition movement? Comrade Xiufeng said: "First, our production management cadres have begun to learn how to follow the mass line in production. Everyone makes plans, and everyone implements them. This is a very important magic weapon for managing factories. Second, to do a good job in our production, in addition to relying on our workers, our cadres, engineers, and technicians at all levels must also be mobilized and unite the backbone with the masses. Third, we have begun to recognize the greatness of the working class's wisdom and creativity. Fourth, we have learned the system that must be established in production management. However, in order to establish the necessary system, we must not only rely on administrative power, but also combine it with the consciousness of the masses.

　　石市工人的增产竞赛
    康伟中
    解放一年多的石家庄工人，觉悟性和积极性正在不断的提高，在去冬备战中，工人阶级更发挥高度的劳动热忱和创造性，不少工厂在完成复工计划上，表现了惊人的成绩，这就是石市增产补损竞赛开展的基础。
    去年十一月二十日，市委提出了全市公营企业展开生产竞赛的号召，经过工厂党、行政与职工会的深入动员，依靠着工人的高度热情，各厂先后卷入热烈的竞赛运动。
    参加这次竞赛运动的有裕民实业公司、前进工厂、大兴纱厂、电话局、北方印刷局、振兴实业公司、自来水厂和华北实业公司各厂。经过两个多月时间，竞赛获致显著成绩：首先是产量质量提高，各厂都提前完成与超过竞赛计划。电话局十天修好了自动电话一千部；前进工厂车辆所原拟一月半装修客货车七十六辆，结果一月零一天就提前完成了；大兴纱厂保全部原来装一部细纱机需时七日，解放后五天装成，竞赛中两天半即完成了。裕民实业公司织布厂竞赛前日产白市布二十二匹二十码，竞赛中日产二十七匹二十四码，产量提高百分之十一强。不仅数量有了提高，在爱护器具、节省原料方面也有相当成绩。如裕民实业公司化学厂的玻璃部，在备战前制造黄料玻璃需用重铬酸钾、硫化锑、二氧化锰相配合；每罐药料合人民币三千五百元，经该部主任徐正华研究改用红糖、活性碳素及少量硫磺为代用品后，所制出的黄色玻璃，质量并没降低，而每罐药料减低成本二千元（人民币）。制冰厂在制阿母尼亚时虽用的材料和以前一样多，但出品超过一倍以上，质量也较前为好。
    在竞赛中工人们发挥了高度的创造性：前进工厂在短短的一个半月竞赛期间，仅技术的改进与发明就不下八十余件；锻工所工人李小五创造的“自链锁”制造法，提高了生产率三倍；裕民实业公司玻璃部徐正华，细心研究出以气管代人力吹瓶，节省了人工，产量也提高了六倍。这些创造与发明在增产运动中起了巨大的作用。
    在这次竞赛过程中，出现了不少的英雄模范与光荣事迹。竞赛开始，前进工厂装修所吴桂荣等十八个青年工人组织了突击组，在自己工作完成后，还帮助别人赶工。北方印刷局第二厂铅印股，在竞赛开始时，局方为了保护工人健康，规定工人义务加班不能过长；但他们自动提早上班，使铅印股的机器增加着转动时间。
    这次成绩获得的原因，中共石市市委刘秀峰同志在总结大会上作了详细的分析，他说：“这首先要归功于我们职工高度劳动的热情和阶级觉悟的提高。生产竞赛运动，只有工厂属于无产阶级领导下的国家才能搞得起来，因为工人懂得：工厂的发展与自己的利益是密切相关的。其次是有计划的发动了这一次竞赛运动，就是说：这份功劳也该归功于我们工友选出来的代表——工会和行政人员、技术人员的计划与领导，这与工友的生产热情相结合，才能使竞赛运动火热的展开。所以，这次竞赛运动是有计划有领导的自觉的群众运动。第三，防止了重量不重质的偏向。第四在思想领导上注意防止了“英雄突出”，我们经常用个人模范要与集体模范相结合来教育工友。使工友们更加紧密的团结生产。第五是竞赛最好有奖励。奖励应该普遍，但是也要有等级，有奖励的竞赛才能持久。第六是要注意不同厂子，不同条件，就用不同的办法来展开这一运动，不能勉强一律，比如不能增加产量的就可以从改进技术，节省原料，减低成本等方面去发动。”
    而在这次竞赛运动中我们学到些什么呢？秀峰同志说：“第一，我们管理生产的干部开始学会了如何在生产中走群众路线。计划大家订，大家来执行，这是管理工厂很重要的法宝。第二，要搞好我们的生产，除依靠我们的工友外，我们的各级干部工程师技术人员也要一齐动员，团结骨干与群众。第三，我们开始认识了工人阶级的智慧和创造力的伟大。第四是我们学会了生产管理上必须建立的制度。但要想建立必须的制度，不只要依靠行政力量，这必得和群众的自觉性结合起来。
