Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, April 28th: In light of the fact that the people of Henan Province actively lent a large amount of grain and fodder during the People's Liberation Army's southern expedition, and that the spring famine in various regions is quite serious, the Central Plains Provisional People's Government has decided that, with the exception of a few areas, all outstanding autumn public grain payments and outstanding spring grain loans from the previous year for middle peasants and those below middle peasants will be waived. Landlords and rich peasants who lack labor, families of revolutionary martyrs, families of revolutionary soldiers, and families of revolutionary workers who have difficulty in living will also be granted postponement, reduction, or exemption of levies based on their circumstances. At the same time, interest-free production loans are being issued, including 3.71 million catties of grain and 205 million Central Plains currency. Currently, people's governments at all levels in Henan Province are using these loans to organize farmers to engage in production and overcome the famine.
