The greatest factor in the strength, power, and invincibility of the Bolshevik Party is that it possesses advanced revolutionary thought.

Our Party knows how to guide its cause in the right direction, and it has the most correct compass – Marxist-Leninist theory. Fourteen years ago, at the 17th Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks), Comrade Stalin, when emphasizing why the Bolsheviks achieved their victories, pointed out: "Because it is a Marxist party, a Leninist party, because it is guided in its work by the teachings of Marx, Engels, and Lenin. There is no doubt that as long as we remain faithful to this doctrine, as long as we grasp this compass, we will continue to succeed in our work in the future." (Russian edition of "Problems of Leninism," page 484)

Marxist-Leninist theory is the science of social development, the workers' movement, socialist revolution, and communist construction. Marxist-Leninist theory scientifically demonstrates the inevitability of the victory of communism and the ways and means to achieve this victory.

Marxism-Leninism is a theory of action. Its task is not only to correctly interpret the world but also to transform it. Once the masses consciously grasp the Marxist-Leninist worldview, it becomes an immense mobilizing, organizing, and transforming force. Comrades Lenin and Stalin have told us more than once that Bolshevik theory is a guide to action, and that there can be no revolutionary action without revolutionary theory.

Guided by Leninism and the highest achievements of Russian and world culture, the Communist Party has led our country to the victory of socialism. Contrary to the predictions and conclusions of bourgeois science, the Soviet people, in their struggle against capitalist ideology, overcame the fierce resistance of many internal and external enemies and built their socialist state. Socialism, which had been dreamed of by many generations, has now become a tangible reality. The principle of public ownership of the means of production and production tools has laid an absolute and unshakable foundation in the Soviet state. The system of exploitation of man by man has been eliminated there, the exploiting classes have been wiped out, and the socialist principle of "from each according to his ability, to each according to his work" has been realized.

The Soviet people are proud that, while imperialism and its agents, the Trotskyites and Bukharinites, attempted to sabotage socialist construction, the overall level of Soviet economic development in the short period of thirteen years has caught up with capitalist countries that were fifty to a hundred years ahead of us.

The Soviet people achieved such victories because they followed the path of Lenin and Stalin. Lenin and Stalin's doctrine that socialism can be victorious in one country is the basis of the Soviet people's patriotic self-esteem. Based on this doctrine, the Russian people, under the leadership of the Bolsheviks, implemented profound socialist reforms throughout the Soviet Union. Now the Soviet people have become the vanguard of all mankind, pointing the way for the world to liberate itself from the capitalist system and move towards the creation of a communist society.

The Great Patriotic War fully and clearly demonstrated the results of the Marxist-Leninist education of our people over the years. The Party made the Soviet people ideologically prepared for the struggle for the freedom and independence of the motherland.

The fact that the Soviet Union became the victor in this war also fully demonstrates the great maturity of our people's thinking, and that in the Soviet Union, Marxist-Leninist ideology and communist ideology have become flesh and blood with the broad masses of workers, peasants, and intellectuals.

Marxist-Leninist doctrine was the sharpest weapon of the Soviet people in the war. Marxist-Leninist doctrine strengthened our faith in the truth, made us understand the noble purpose and justice of the Great Patriotic War, and armed our soldiers and rear-area personnel with this understanding. Marxist-Leninist thought further enhanced the spirit of Soviet patriotism and the sentiment of sacred hatred towards the enemy. Soviet officers used Marxist-Leninist thought to educate and train our soldiers and junior officers, instilling in them extremely high political enthusiasm, solidifying their loyalty to the socialist motherland and the cause of the great Lenin and Stalin, and preparing them to overcome the enemy at any cost and under any circumstances.

Comrade Stalin, based on the theoretical foundations of Marxism-Leninism, created and developed Soviet military science, and the war greatly manifested the excellence of this military science. The entire experience of the Great Patriotic War of the Soviet Union proved the outstanding achievements of this military science, which had been tested on the battlefield. The Soviet army, armed with Stalinist military science, shattered the boasting and exaggerated authority of all bourgeois military theorists and achieved an unprecedented military victory over Hitler's Germany.

The advanced Soviet socialist system and the most advanced worldview based on Marxism-Leninism defined the advanced nature of Soviet military science.

After the Great Patriotic War of the Soviet Union, the Soviet people, as always, took the teachings of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin as their guiding light, and under the shining light of this beacon, carried out the cause of peaceful construction and the struggle towards communism. Marxist-Leninist doctrine spiritually armed our people. It revealed to the people the prospects of communism, pointed out the path of communist construction, and strengthened their confidence in the inevitable victory of communism.

Recently, the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) passed many important resolutions on ideological issues. This attention paid by the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) to ideological education work illustrates that to complete the post-war recovery and development plan of the national economy, and to implement the program of communist construction in our country, all of this is related to the ideological level of the Soviet people, the degree of communist consciousness of the Soviet people, and the level and scale of our ideological education.

The Party has always emphasized the great significance of educating and raising the political consciousness of the working people. In the current conditions of completing socialist construction and gradually transitioning to communism, the work of political education of the people is of particularly great significance.

Fighting against the remnants of capitalism in the consciousness of the Soviet people, educating the builders of communism, solidifying the confidence in the victory of the cause of the party of Lenin and Stalin, and preparing to overcome any difficulties on the road to communism - all of this work is a prerequisite for our victorious advance.

The Party constantly educates all Party and Soviet cadres, all military workers, to tenaciously and unwaveringly study and master Marxist-Leninist theory.

Comrade Stalin educated our cadres that there is a scientific department that all Bolsheviks in all scientific departments must know – "this is Marxist-Leninism, the science of society, the laws of social development, the laws of development of socialist construction, and the victory of communism." (Russian edition of "Problems of Leninism," pages 5, 9, 8)

A Bolshevik cannot merely be an expert in his favorite practical work sector. He should not limit himself to his specialized knowledge and should not exclude himself from the circle of socio-political life.

Soviet officers, Party and non-Party Bolsheviks in the Soviet armed forces, should all be politicians and social activists. They should express an active interest in social life and in the struggle of our people for the victory of communism. They should be familiar with the laws of social development, and they should know where our cause is developing and how it is developing.

Comrade Stalin often educated our cadres in this way, saying that if practical work is separated from the theory of the Bolshevik Party, it cannot be carried out. The more actively our cadres improve their ideological level, and the higher their political consciousness, the better and more effectively our practical work can be carried out. Conversely, the lower the political level of cadres, the more easily their work will fail, and the workers themselves will become short-sighted pragmatists and petty people who only seek immediate interests, and will become politically blind and wavering people and the easiest to be captured by bourgeois ideology.

In peacetime, the soldiers of the Soviet navy, army, and air force still bear major and glorious tasks. Their mission is to be highly vigilant in defending the peace and construction cause that our people have won. To loyally defend the national interests of the Soviet Union, to complete the above tasks requires us to deeply understand our sacred obligations to the motherland, to better serve the motherland, and to make our political and military knowledge more mature.

If our officers can persistently educate soldiers and junior cadres with the thought of the Lenin-Stalin Party, and constantly explain to them the current tasks of the Party and the Soviet state, then our soldiers and junior cadres can truly understand the glorious tasks of the soldiers of the Soviet armed forces.

Whether Soviet officers can clearly and deeply understand their military tasks and fulfill these tasks in an exemplary manner depends on how well they understand the Bolshevik Party's worldview and how they use this worldview to understand the current tasks of the Soviet people and the ways to solve these tasks. Only officers who have studied Marxist-Leninist theory, who understand the policies and tasks of the Bolshevik Party and the Soviet state, can correctly lead the training and education of their subordinates. If the leader of a unit is not good at training and educating his subordinates in the spirit of constantly implementing all military discipline requirements, and if he is not good at inspiring the subordinates' sense of military self-esteem and responsibility for completing the unit's tasks, but only relies on his own low level of political knowledge, then he himself cannot become an example for his subordinates.

　　苏联军官的强有力的思想武器
    本文为苏军政治部动员干部加强理论学习专论
    叶群译
    布尔什维克党之所以强大有力和不可战胜的最大的因素就是由于党具有先进的革命的思想。
    我们党知道把事业引导到那个方向去，我们党有最正确的指南针——马克思主义和列宁主义理论。十四年以前，在联共（布）第十七次代表大会上斯大林同志说到布尔什维克因为什么会取得自己的胜利时曾经强调指出“——就是因为它是马克思主义的党，是列宁主义的党，就是因为它在自己的工作中是以马克思、恩格斯、列宁学说为指南的。毫无疑义地，只要我们始终仍然忠实于这个学说，只要我们始终把握住这个指南针，那么我们今后在自己的工作中也一定会得到成功。”（俄版列宁主义问题四八四页）
    马克思、列宁的理论是关于社会发展，关于工人运动，关于社会主义革命以及共产主义建设的科学，马列主义理论科学的论证了共产主义胜利的必然性及实现这个胜利的道路和手段。
    马列主义是行动的理论，其任务不仅仅是为了正确的解释世界，而且是为了改造世界，马列主义的宇宙观被群众自觉的掌握之后就会成为巨大无比的动员力量组织力量和改造力量，列宁、斯大林同志不只一次地告诉我们说：布尔什维克的理论是行动的指南，不只一次地告诉我们说：没有革命的理论就不能有革命的行动。
    以列宁主义及俄国、世界文化的最高成就为指南的共产党已引导着我们国家走向社会主义的胜利，与资产阶级科学的预言和论断整整相反，苏维埃人民在同资本主义思想进行斗争中，克服了很多内外敌人的凶残的反抗，建成了自己的社会主义国家。曾被很多前代人所幻想过的社会主义，现在已变成了真实的现实。生产手段，生产工具归社会公有的这一原则，在苏维埃国家里，已奠定了绝对的，不可振撼的统治。在那里已消灭了人剥削人的制度，肃清了剥削阶级，并实现了“各尽所能，各取所值”的社会主义原则。
    值得苏联人民引为自豪的是：我们的人民在帝国主义及其代理人托洛斯基、布哈林等企图破坏社会主义建设的情形下，在十三年的短暂过程里，苏联经济发展的总水准已经赶上了比我国先进五十年到一百年的资本主义国家。
    苏联人民取得这样的胜利是由于他们走了列宁、斯大林的道路，列宁、斯大林的关于社会主义在一国可以胜利的学说，是苏联人民爱国主义自尊心的依据。依据这一学说，俄国人民在布尔什维克的领导下，实行了全苏范围的深入的社会主义改革，现在苏联人民已成为全人类的先锋队，已向全世界指出了，从资本主义制度里解放出来，和走向创造共产主义社会的道路。
    伟大的卫国战争，充分明确地说明了我国人民多年来马列主义教养的结果，党使得苏联人民为祖国自由和独立的胜利斗争有了思想的准备。
    苏联成为这次战争的胜利者这件事，也充分的说明了我国人民的思想已大大的成熟，说明了在苏联，马列主义思想、共产主义思想已与广大的工人、农民、知识分子群众血肉相关的结为一体。
    马、列主义学说，是苏联人民在战争中最尖锐的武器，马、列主义学说，巩固了我们对真理的信仰，使我们理解了伟大卫国战争的高尚目的和正义性，并用这种理解武装了我们的军人和后方工作人员，马列主义思想更提高了苏联的爱国主义精神，以及神圣的对敌憎恨的情绪。苏联军官以马列主义思想来教育和锻炼了我们的士兵和下级军官。使他们有极高的政治情绪。用马列主义思想坚定了他们对社会主义祖国，对伟大列宁、斯大林党的事业的忠心，并使他准备好，不惜任何代价，不顾任何条件，随时去战胜敌人。
    斯大林同志曾依据马列主义的理论基础，创造和发展了苏维埃的军事科学，而战争又把这种军事科学的卓越性大大的显现了出来。伟大的苏联卫国战争中的全部经验，都证明了这种在战场上考验了的军事科学的卓越成就。被斯大林军事科学武装了的苏维埃军队，已经击碎了一切资产阶级军事理论家的吹牛、夸大的权威。并取得了战胜希特勒德国的史无前例的军事胜利。
    先进的苏维埃社会主义制度，以马列主义为基础的最先进的人生观，规定了苏维埃军事科学的先进性。
    在伟大的苏联卫国战争之后，苏联人民仍和任何时候一样，以马、恩、列、斯的学说为灯塔，并在这灯塔的万丈光芒的照耀下，进行着和平建设的事业，和走向共产主义的斗争。马、列主义学说从精神上武装着我们的人民。他给人民揭示出共产主义的远景，指出了共产主义建设的道路，和坚定了共产主义必然胜利的信心。
    最近期间，联共中央委员会，曾通过了很多关于思想问题的重要决议。联共中央对思想教育工作的这种注意说明了要完成战后恢复和发展国民经济计划，要在我国，实行共产主义建设的纲领，这一切都关系于苏联人民的思想水准，苏联人民的共产主义觉悟程度，我们的思想教育的水准和规模。
    党在任何时候，都强调提高劳动人民政治觉悟这种教育的重大意义。在完成社会主义建设，逐渐转入共产主义的现存条件下，人民政治教育的工作，更有特别重大的意义。
    向苏维埃人民意识中的资本主义残余进行斗争，对共产主义建设者进行教育。坚定对列宁、斯大林党事业的胜利信心，准备好去克服走向共产主义道路上任何困难，这一切工作，都是我们胜利前进的，必备的条件。
    党经常教育一切党的、苏维埃的干部，一切军事工作者，要顽强地，坚持不移地，学习掌握马列主义理论。
    斯大林同志教育我们干部说，有一个科学部门，是一切科学部门中的布尔什维克，必须知悉的，——“这就是马列主义关于社会，关于社会发展规律，关于社会主义建设事业发展规律，关于共产主义胜利的科学。”（俄版列宁主义问题五、九、八页）
    布尔什维克不能仅仅是他自己所喜爱的实际工作部门的专家，他不应当以自己的专门知识为限，不应当把自己排除在社会政治生活的圈子外面。
    苏维埃的军官，苏联武装部队里的党的，非党的布尔什维克，都应当是政治家，是社会活动家，他们对社会生活，对我国人民为共产主义胜利而进行的斗争不应当不表示积极的兴趣，他们应当通晓社会发展的规律，应当知道我们的事业正在向那里发展和怎样发展。
    斯大林同志经常这样教育我们干部，他说，如果脱离了布尔什维克党的理论，干部的实际工作就不可能进行，我们的干部越是积极的提高自己的思想水准，越是具有高度的政治觉悟，那么我们的实际工作就能更好，更有效的进行。反之，干部的政治水准越低，则他的工作就越容易失败，而工作者本身，也就越会变成鼠目寸光的事务主义者，和只图眼前利益的小人，越会成为政治上盲目的和动摇的人及最容易被资产阶级思想俘虏的人。
    在和平时期，苏联海、陆、空军的将士们仍负有重大和光荣的任务。其使命是高度警惕地保卫我国人民已争得的和平和建设事业。忠心保卫苏联的国家利益，要完成上述任务就要求我们深刻的了解自己对祖国的神圣义务，更好的服务祖国，和使自己的政治、军事知识，更加成熟。
    如果我们的军官们，能坚持地以列宁、斯大林党的思想来教育战士和下级干部，经常向他们解释党和苏维埃国家的当前任务，那么我们的士兵和下级干部，就能真正的领会苏维埃武装部队战士的光荣任务。
    苏维埃军官要清楚和深刻地理解自己的军事任务和模范的完成这些任务，这一切能否作到都看他对布尔什维克党的人生观的了解程度怎样？和怎样以这种人生观去了解苏联人民当前任务，和解决这些任务的途径？只有研究了马列主义理论的军官，懂得布尔什维克党和苏联国家的政策及任务的军官，才能正确的领导对部下的训练和教育工作。部队首长如果不善于以不断执行全部军事纪律要求的精神来训练和教育自己的部下，如果不善于启发部下的军人自尊心，和完成部队任务的责任心。而只凭自己政治知识的低级水准，那么他本身就不能成为部下的榜样。
