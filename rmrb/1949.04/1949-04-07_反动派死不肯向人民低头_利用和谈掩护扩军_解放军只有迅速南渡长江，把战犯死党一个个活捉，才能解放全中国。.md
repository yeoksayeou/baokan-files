Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 6th:
  The reactionary Nanjing Kuomintang government, behind the scenes of the peace negotiations, is stepping up the training of troops, preparing to continue the counter-revolutionary war, and waiting for an opportunity to counterattack the people. The bogus Ministry of National Defense has established fourteen training headquarters responsible for training Kuomintang bandit troops, attempting to restore all the troops annihilated in the three-year anti-people civil war, and to re-expand the Kuomintang regular army, which has been weakened to just over one million people, to 2.5 million to 5 million. According to available materials, there are currently 37 corps and two divisions of counter-revolutionary troops that have been established and are being supplemented and trained. The corps belonging to the Qiu Qingquan Corps and the Huang Wei Corps, which were annihilated in the Huaihai Campaign not long ago, are also being restored. The commanders, locations, and responsible training troop numbers of these fourteen training headquarters are as follows:

    First Training Headquarters: Commander Wang Jingjiu, stationed in Longxi, Fujian, commanding the 5th Corps, 25th Corps, and 121st Corps.

    Second Training Headquarters: Commander Hu Lian, stationed in Shangrao, Jiangxi, commanding the 10th Corps, 18th Corps, and 67th Corps.

    Third Training Headquarters: Commander Shen Fazao, stationed in Ganzhou, Jiangxi, commanding the 70th Corps and 23rd Corps.

    Fourth Training Headquarters: Commander Ou Zhen, stationed in Guangzhou, Guangdong, commanding the 62nd Corps, 63rd Corps, 64th Corps, and 109th Corps.

    Fifth Training Headquarters: Commander Huang Jie, stationed in Hengyang, Hunan, commanding the 100th Corps and 102nd Corps.

    Sixth Training Headquarters: Commander He Shaozhou, stationed in Kunming, Yunnan, commanding the 26th Corps, 49th Corps, and 89th Corps.

    Seventh Training Headquarters: Commander Luo Guangwen, stationed in Chongqing, Sichuan, commanding the 44th Corps, 108th Corps, and 110th Corps.

    Eighth Training Headquarters: Commander Chen Tie, stationed in Chengdu, Sichuan, commanding the 72nd Corps and 112th Corps.

    Ninth Training Headquarters: Commander Zhang Xuezhong, stationed in Quzhou, Zhejiang, commanding the 12th Corps, 73rd Corps, 74th Corps, and 85th Corps.

    Tenth Training Headquarters: Commander Sun Yuanliang, stationed in Wanxian, Sichuan, commanding the 41st Corps and 47th Corps.

    Eleventh Training Headquarters: Commander Zhong Ji, stationed in Nanning, Guangxi, commanding the 329th Division and 330th Division.

    Twelfth Training Headquarters: Commander Hu Zongnan, stationed in Hanzhong, Shaanxi, commanding the 76th Corps, 113th Corps, and 114th Corps.

    Thirteenth Training Headquarters: Commander Li Mi, stationed in Changting, Fujian, commanding the 8th Corps, 9th Corps, and 39th Corps.

    Fourteenth Training Headquarters: Commander Song Xilian, stationed in Enshi, Hubei, commanding the 14th Corps, 118th Corps, and 122nd Corps.

  The troop strength of the above corps and divisions is extremely insufficient, and many only have empty designations. The bogus Ministry of National Defense plans to conscript two million soldiers and has ordered the respective training headquarters to recruit soldiers locally and quickly replenish them. However, because the People's Liberation Army is about to cross the Yangtze River southward, and the broad masses of the people are extremely opposed to the counter-revolutionary civil war and refuse to be cannon fodder for the reactionaries, it is absolutely impossible to realize their arrogant dream, whether by conscription or recruitment. The Kuomintang reactionaries have sent representatives to conduct peace talks and clamor for "unconditional ceasefire on the spot" in an attempt to prevent or delay the People's Liberation Army's advance to the south of the Yangtze River, in order to buy time to complete this huge plan to train counter-revolutionary armed forces. This shows how sinister and treacherous the Kuomintang reactionaries are, and what evil intentions they harbor. Although they have been definitively defeated, and their Li Zongren and He Yingqin government has had to express its acceptance of Chairman Mao Zedong's eight peace conditions as the basis for negotiations, and has sent six peace talk representatives to Beiping; the reactionaries are not only refusing to bow their heads to the people and hand over the reactionary army to be reorganized by the People's Liberation Army in accordance with democratic principles, but are also massively expanding counter-revolutionary armed forces, continuing to act as the jackals of American imperialism in China, preparing to stage a comeback with the qualification of being "part of the world's anti-communist struggle," and slaughter the Chinese people. This most effectively educates the Chinese people and the People's Liberation Army: only by rapidly advancing south across the Yangtze River, carrying out a thorough housecleaning, sweeping away the nests of evil-intentioned counter-revolutionaries piece by piece, eliminating the existing and in-training bandit armed forces one by one, and capturing alive those war criminals, die-hard elements, and ambitious elements who are incorrigible, can all of China be completely liberated, and can the Chinese people truly live in peace.

　　反动派死不肯向人民低头
  　利用和谈掩护扩军
    解放军只有迅速南渡长江，把战犯死党一个个活捉，才能解放全中国。
    【新华社北平六日电】南京国民党反动政府在和平谈判的幕后，正加紧编练军队，准备继续反革命战争，并待机向人民反扑。伪国防部已设置了十四个编练司令部，负责编练国民党匪军，妄想把在三年反人民内战中被歼灭的部队全部恢复起来，使目前已经削弱到只剩一百多万人的国民党正规军从新扩充为二百五十万至五百万人。据已有材料，目前已经建立番号正在进行补充和编练的反革命部队，共有三十七个军和两个师，不久以前在淮海战役中被歼的邱清泉兵团、黄维兵团等所属各军，亦在恢复之列。这十四个编练司令部的司令人员、驻地及其负责编练部队的番号如下：
    第一编练司令部：司令王敬久，驻福建龙溪，辖第五军、二十五军、一二一军。
    第二编练司令部：司令胡琏，驻江西上饶，辖第十军、十八军、六十七军。
    第三编练司令部：司令沈发藻，驻江西赣州，辖七十军、二十三军。
    第四编练司令部：司令欧震，驻广东广州，辖六十二军、六十三军、六十四军、一零九军。
    第五编练司令部：司令黄杰，驻湖南衡阳，辖一百军、一零二军。
    第六编练司令部：司令何绍周，驻云南昆明，辖二十六军、四十九军、八十九军。
    第七编练司令部：司令罗广文，驻四川重庆，辖四十四军、一零八军、一一零军。
    第八编练司令部：司令陈铁，驻四川成都，辖七十二军、一一二军。
    第九编练司令部：司令张雪中，驻浙江衢州，辖十二军、七十三军、七十四军、八十五军。
    第十编练司令部：司令孙元良，驻四川万县，辖四十一军、四十七军。
    第十一编练司令部：司令钟纪，驻广西南宁，辖三二九师、三三零师。
    第十二编练司令部：司令胡宗南，驻陕西汉中，辖七十六军、一一三军、一一四军。
    第十三编练司令部：司令李弥，驻福建长汀，辖第八军、第九军、三十九军。
    第十四编练司令部：司令宋希濂，驻湖北恩施，辖十四军、一一八军、一二二军。
    上述各军、师兵额极不充实，有许多还只有一个空头番号。伪国防部拟征丁二百万，并命令各该编练司令部就地募兵，迅速补充。但由于人民解放军即将南渡长江，以及广大民众极端反对反革命内战，拒绝替反动派当炮灰，故无论采取征发或招募办法，都绝对无法实现其狂妄的梦想。国民党反动派派出代表进行和谈，并大肆叫嚣“无条件就地停战”，即在企图借以阻止或延缓人民解放军向江南的进军，以便争取时间，完成这一庞大的编练反革命武装的计划。由此可见国民党反动派是何等阴险奸诈，何等包藏祸心。虽然他们已经肯定地失败了，而且他们的李宗仁何应钦政府已经不能不表示承认以毛泽东主席的八项和平条件作为谈判基础，并已派了六个和谈代表来到北平；但是反动派不但不向人民低头，交出反动军队听候人民解放军按照民主原则改编，而且正在大规模地扩编反革命武装，继续充当美帝国主义在中国的鹰犬，即所谓以“世界反共斗争之一部分”的资格，准备卷土重来，屠杀中国人民。这就最有效地教育了中国人民和人民解放军：只有迅速地渡江南进，进行犁庭扫穴工作，把包藏祸心的反革命渊薮一块块扫除，把已有的和正在编练中的土匪武装一股股消灭，把那些至死不悟的战犯死党野心分子一个个活捉，全中国才完全解放，中国人民方能真正过太平日子。
