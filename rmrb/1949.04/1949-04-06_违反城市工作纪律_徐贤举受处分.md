(Tianjin Electric) In order to rectify revolutionary discipline, the Tangda District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has given Comrade Xu Xianju, who had become corrupt, degenerate, and lost his standpoint, a public warning. Comrade Xu Xianju joined the Communist Party in 1945. After the liberation of Tangda, Xu was assigned to the Yongli Alkali Plant to be responsible for worker affairs. Soon after, Xu brought his wife to live in the home of a worker named Yang, who worked at Yongli, and privately accepted 500 catties of coal from the factory. This violated the city work discipline of "no accepting invitations to meals or gifts of any kind." Furthermore, using the excuse that his wife was ill, he did not work for half a month. At the same time, he supported the factory's plan to unreasonably dismiss 100 construction workers. He lost his revolutionary standpoint, arbitrarily handled the matter himself, neither requesting instructions beforehand nor promptly reporting afterward, fully demonstrating a lack of organization and discipline. When the higher authorities decided to transfer Xu out of the Yongli Alkali Plant, Xu even called the factory director, asking the director to go to the Military Control Sub-Committee to request that he be retained. Comrade Xu Xianju, not long after entering the city, forgot the education the Party gave him before entering the city and lost his revolutionary standpoint. In order to educate Comrade Xu Xianju and all party members in Tangda, the Tangda District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party decided to give Comrade Xu Xianju a public warning as a disciplinary measure.

　　违反城市工作纪律
  　徐贤举受处分
    【天津电】中共塘大区委为整饬革命纪律，已将腐化堕落丧失立场的徐贤举同志，予以当众警告处分。徐贤举同志于一九四五年加入共产党。塘大解放后，徐被派到永利碱厂负责工人工作。不久徐即将其妻接来，住在永利工人杨某家中，并私自接受厂方煤五百斤，违犯了“不许吃请及接受任何馈送”的城市工作纪律，且借口妻子有病，半个月不做工作。同时竟支持厂方无理解雇一百名盖房工人的打算。丧失革命立场，自己擅加处理，事前既不请示，事后又不及时报告，充分表现了无组织无纪律。当上级决定将徐调出永利碱厂时，徐竟给厂长打电话，求厂长到军管分会去请求挽留。徐贤举同志在入城不久，就忘掉了党在入城前对他的教育，丧失革命立场。为教育徐贤举同志及塘大全体党员，中共塘大区委决定给徐贤举同志以当众警告处分。
