Taiyue Trading Company Rectifies Warehouse
　　Inspects Material Management
　　[Taiyue Telegram] The Taiyue Trading Company has initially inspected its material management work over the past year. The past problems in material management were: 1. Insufficient leadership oversight and a lack of tight control. For example, at the Yongyu Main Store, there were many errors in the ledger and accounting books at the end of June, but they were not corrected in a timely manner. 2. General cadres looked down upon management work, believing that warehousing work had no future and was difficult to do; there was also a tendency to value money and devalue material storage. For example, the Yongyu Main Store once had a cash shortage of 500 yuan, which everyone investigated several times; but they were less concerned about the leakage of more than 300 jin of gasoline in the warehouse, and the spoilage of grain and salt, believing that it was "lost or leaked, and not that the cadres were embezzling." In addition, emphasis was placed on physical labor, while design work was neglected, with more people doing the work and fewer people planning. Individual comrades at the Yongheng Main Store also believed that warehousing work was just "lifting," "carrying," and "weighing," and their work was passive. 3. In terms of systems: in the past, bookkeeping procedures were extremely unsound, lacking clear division of labor and scientific management. In the past, at the Yongfeng Main Store, everyone received, everyone managed, everyone was responsible, and no one was responsible, resulting in a situation where no one was held accountable when problems arose. The Yongheng Main Store stored cotton in Shangwucun, Yicheng, and over 100 jin were damaged due to dampness. In addition, the common problem was that goods were not separated by quality and were piled together when entering the warehouse, so they were always sold at a lower price than the general market price, selling good goods at the price of inferior goods. After this general rectification of warehouses and inventory of materials, leaders at all levels gradually began to pay attention to warehousing work. All regions have established specialized agencies, equipped warehouse cadres, established various storage systems, checked losses once every ten days, and conducted a final inventory at the end of each month to clear accounts immediately. The rationality of attrition is also being studied for improvement. Other methods for receiving goods, buying goods, dispatching goods, selling goods, inventory in sales departments, and various material management methods have all been detailed and regulated.

　　太岳贸易公司整顿仓库
  　检查物资管理
    【太岳电】太岳贸易公司初步检查去年一年来的物资管理工作。过去物资管理上的毛病是：一、领导上检查少，抓得不紧，如永裕总店六月底的保管帐和会计帐上，有很多错误，但却未及时纠正。二、一般干部轻视管理工作，认为保管工作没前途，不好做；并有看重金钱而轻视物资保管的倾向。如永裕总店有一次短少现金五百元，大家检查了几次；但对仓库的汽油漏了三百多斤，粮食、食盐等的脱耗腐烂，就不大关心，认为那是“丢漏了，并不是干部贪污了”。另外是重视体力劳动，忽视设计工作，出力的人多，计划的人少。永恒总店也有个别同志认为保管工作就是“抬”“扛”“过秤”，工作处于被动。三、在制度方面：过去帐簿手续极不健全，缺乏明确分工，科学管理。永丰总店过去是谁也收，谁也管，谁也负责，谁也不负责，出了问题无人负责的现象。永恒总店在翼城上吴村存棉花，因地下潮湿，坏了一百多斤。此外普遍的毛病是商品不分质量好坏，入库时都堆在一起，出售时便总比一般市价低一些，好货卖成次货价钱。经过这次普遍整顿仓库，清理与盘存物资后，各级领导上对保管工作，逐渐重视起来，各地都建立起专门机构，配备仓库干部，建立了各种保管制度，每旬清查一次损耗，每月终清库，总兑一次，即时转清。并研究脱耗的合理与否，以作改进。其他收货、买货、发货、卖货、营业门市部的存货，以及物资管理的各种方法，均有了详细的规定与办法。
