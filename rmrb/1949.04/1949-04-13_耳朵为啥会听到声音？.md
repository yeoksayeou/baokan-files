Why Can Ears Hear Sounds?

　　The ear is the organ for hearing sounds. So, if we cut off our ears, could we still hear?
    The answer is: yes, although it would be less clear.
    What we see as the ear is actually only the less important part of the ear—the outer ear. Its function is simply to collect sound waves from the air and transmit them inward.
    Inside the outer ear is a passage a little over an inch long, called the ear canal. At the end of the ear canal is a thin membrane, like the skin stretched on a drum, called the eardrum. When sound waves travel from the ear canal to this point, the eardrum begins to vibrate. The eardrum is connected to a small chain of three small bones, the malleus, incus, and stapes, which also swing back and forth, transmitting the vibration to the inner ear.
    The inner ear is a very complex machine, shaped like a coiled conch shell, with another membrane inside, connected to the auditory nerve. This is the last stop from the outer ear to the brain. Any sound we hear is a process of successively transmitting vibrations at the same speed as the original sound, station by station. Therefore, in deaf or hard-of-hearing people, a certain part of the ear must have completely or partially lost the ability to vibrate, so the sound cannot be transmitted well to the auditory nerve.
    Machines need to be oiled from time to time, and so does the ear. The oil added to the ear is very soft and thick, called earwax. But in some people, too much earwax or hardened earwax can block the ear canal, preventing the sound vibrations from passing through, resulting in poor hearing.

### 耳朵为啥会听到声音？

　　耳朵为啥会听到声音？
    耳朵是听声音的器官，那末，如果把我们的耳朵割掉，我们还能听吗？
    回答是：能的，虽然要比较听不清楚些。
    原来我们所看到的耳朵，只是耳朵较不重要的一部分——外耳。它的功用，只是收集空中的声波，传进去。
    外耳进去，就是一英寸多长的一条小道，叫做听管。听管之末，有一层薄膜，象鼓上张的皮一样，叫做鼓膜。音波从耳管传到这里，鼓膜也开始震动。鼓膜里面连着由锤骨、砧骨、马蹬骨三根小骨所组成的小链索，也就前后摆动，把震动传到内耳去。
    内耳是件很复杂的机器，形状象卷起的贝谷，另外有一层薄膜在内，连着听神经，这就是从外耳连到脑子的末一站。我们听到的任何声音，都是一站一站地相继把与原来声音同速度的震动传达进去的。所以聋子或听觉不好的人，耳朵里一定有一部分器官完全或者部分地失去了震动的能力，因此声音就不能很好地传到听神经。
    机器要时常加油，耳朵也是如此。耳朵加的油很软很浓，叫做耳脑。但有些人的耳脑太多或变得很硬，就会阻塞住耳管，使声音的震动不能通过而变成听觉不良。
