The former puppet Baojia chiefs before the liberation of Beiping acted like tyrants and arbitrarily oppressed the people. For example, in the bao where I lived, there was once a need to apportion money for two soldiers before liberation, which should have been 2,400 to 2,500 yuan in Gold Yuan notes, but the Baojia chief allocated more than 4,000 yuan, and they all bought "soldier boat flour" [inferior quality flour]. At that time, flour was about 60 yuan a bag, and they bought about 70 bags. By the time they paid the money upwards, the flour had risen to more than 1,000 yuan a bag, and the more than 2,000 yuan paid was only worth two bags of flour. The remaining sixty-odd bags were all divided up by the Baojia chief and the three-person group who handled it. I think this kind of thing should be treated as embezzlement and they should return the stolen goods to the masses.

　　内二区八保伪保甲长
  　贪污白面应退出
    北平解放前，伪保甲长们作威作福，任意欺压人民。如我住的这一保，解放前有一次要摊两个兵额的钱，应是金圆券二千四五百元，而保甲长派了四千余元，他们全买了兵船面。那时面粉约合六十余元一袋，共买了约七十袋面。及至往上缴款时，面已涨到千余元一袋了，所缴的两千余元，仅合两袋面。下余六十余袋，全由保甲长及经手的三人小组分了。我觉得象这种事情应当以贪污论。让他们把赃物退给群众。
