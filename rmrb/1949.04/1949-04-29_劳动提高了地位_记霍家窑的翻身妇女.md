　　Labor Improves Status
　　A Record of Liberated Women in Hojia Kiln

　　When reporters were interviewing rural women in Hojia Kiln, Sixth District of Licheng, women had a common opinion: "The Communist Party leads well, and women are truly liberated." The following are some examples: Zhang Yinfeng's mother-in-law was a wicked old woman who treated Yinfeng very badly in the past. Her father-in-law and husband also treated her coldly. Since the village women's association criticized her mother-in-law, helped Yinfeng learn to spin and weave, and actively participate in field labor (before liberation, the vast majority of women in the village did not participate in field labor and did not know how to spin and weave), the relationship between the family members slowly improved. The mother-in-law could spin but not weave. The mother-in-law spun and she wove. The mother-in-law took care of the children for her. This also changed the father-in-law's thinking. He said, "I used to look down on women. Look at how capable Yinfeng is at work." Yinfeng participated in literacy groups to learn culture, and he caring bought her pencils and notebooks. Zhao Huanlian, a child bride, was looked down upon by everyone in the village before liberation. She was always humble, and her mother-in-law and husband would quarrel with her whenever they wanted. The Communist Party brought happiness to Huanlian. She learned to spin and weave, and she also learned to farm. Everyone in the village praised her and elected her as a representative to the People's Congress. Last autumn, she worked in the fields and helped each other with other people, earning two big dou of corn. Now her mother-in-law and husband are good to her. The mother-in-law boasted to others: "My Huanlian is good at everything she does." Fan Gaihua was weak and incompetent in the past, had no status at home, and dared not say anything. Under the leadership of the women's association, she learned to spin and weave. Last year, in one spring three-month period, she wove thirty zhang of cloth. She and her mother-in-law earned six zhang of cloth together. The family exchanged for new clothes. Her father-in-law, Huo Shouyi, was extremely happy: "In previous years, the family had to patch up three or four zhang of cloth to change clothes for the season, selling a lot of grain. Now women are really progressive and capable." He gave Gaihua a bonus of two thousand yuan. Women's labor and production have created a democratic and pleasant life between many couples. Take Huo Gailian (female) and Liang Chunxian (male), for example. When they went to the fields to produce, the woman chased the livestock, and the man carried the furniture on his back. The couple talked and laughed. When planting, Gailian led the livestock and planted seeds for her husband. Chunxian also discussed everything with Gailian. When buying things at the market, they also broke the old habit of thousands of years. Chunxian often let Gailian go to the market to trade, and he worked at home. From their own experience, the women of the village realized that actively engaging in labor and production is the correct path to achieve women's liberation. The women enthusiastically reflected: "If it weren't for the Communist Party, we wouldn't be able to turn ourselves over. Without production and labor, women would not have today's status!" Now the women of the village and various weaving groups are responding to the call of the Great Production Movement with active actions.

　　劳动提高了地位
  　记霍家窑的翻身妇女
    当记者在黎城六区霍家窑农妇中进行访问的时候，妇女们有一个普遍的舆论：“共产党领导的好，妇女真是翻身解放了”。下面是一部分事例：张银凤她婆婆是个恶老婆，过去对银凤很不好，公公丈夫也是冷眼对待，自从村上妇女会批评了她婆婆，帮助银凤学会了纺花织布，并且积极参加了田间劳动（解放前该村绝大部份妇女没有参加田间劳动习惯也不会纺织），一家人关系慢慢变好了，婆婆会纺不会织，婆婆纺花她织布，婆婆给她看小孩，这样也改变了公公的思想，他说：“过去我瞧不起女人，你瞧银凤干活真是顶事”。银凤参加识字组学文化，他便关心的给银凤买铅笔买学习本。童养媳妇赵还莲解放前，村中家里谁也瞧不起她，整天家低声下气，婆婆男人谁想吵就吵她。共产党给还莲带来了幸福，她学会了纺织，也学会了种地，村中人人称赞，选她当了人代会代表。去秋她下地生产和别人变工互助，挣了二大斗玉茭，如今婆婆男人都对她好起来，婆婆夸耀着给别人说：“俺还莲干哪样生活，都是好手。”樊改花过去软弱无能，在家中没地位，什么事也不敢吮，在妇女会领导下，她学会了纺织，去年一个春三月，她织了三十丈布，她和婆婆共赚了六丈布，一家人换了新衣，她公公霍守义高兴得了不得：“往年一家人换季穿衣，补补贴贴也得三四丈布，卖掉好多粮食，这会妇女们真是进步能干啦。”他给了改花两千元的奖金。妇女们的劳动生产，更创造了许多夫妇间民主愉快的生活，就拿霍改莲（女）和梁春贤（男）来说吧，下地生产时，女的撵着牲口，男的背上家具，夫妻俩说说笑笑，下种时，改莲给丈夫牵牲口、栽种子。春贤办个甚事，也要和改莲商议商议。买东西赶集，也打破了几千年来的旧习惯，春贤常常让改莲去赶集买卖，自己在家中劳动。该村妇女们从自身经历中，体会到积极劳动生产，是求得妇女解放的正确道路。妇女们热烈反映：“不是共产党，咱们翻不了身，不生产劳动，妇女也不会有今天的地位！”现该村妇女、各纺织小组，正以积极的行动来响应大生产运动的号召。
