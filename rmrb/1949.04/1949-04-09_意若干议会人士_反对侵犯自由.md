　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, Eighth: TASS, Rome: Parliamentary figures strongly protested against the open threats to freedom of speech, freedom of trade unions, and the rights of opposition parties contained in the speech made by Italian Interior Minister Scelba in Siena on the third. The Vice-President of the Chamber of Deputies, Socialist Ferdinando Targetti, submitted a question to the President of the Council of Ministers, asking him to explain to the parliament this unprecedented talk by a government official. Targetti demanded that the government answer whether this speech contained the content published in the newspapers, according to which: "The weapons given to the police must also be used as a means of attack." Targetti further questioned whether it was true that Scelba demanded that the organs of state power, first and foremost the municipal councils, immediately severely punish the person in charge of the Communist weekly "Vie Nuove". In his questioning, Targetti pointed out that all these actions are "a blatant infringement of the administrative power of the judicial organs."

　　意若干议会人士
  　反对侵犯自由
    【新华社北平八日电】塔斯社罗马讯：议会人士强烈抗议意内长谢尔巴三日在西纳发表的演说中所包含的对于言论自由、职工会自由和反对党权利的公开威胁。下院副议长社会党人费德兰多。塔基蒂向部长会议主席提出质问，请他向议会解释政府人员这一史无前例的谈话。塔基蒂要求政府答复这一演说是否包含着报纸所刊出的谈话内容，据这些报纸说：“交予警察的武器也必须用作进攻的手段。”塔基蒂进一步质问道：谢尔巴要求政权机关，首先是市代表会议，立即严重惩处共产党周刊“维斯·摩尔”的负责人一事，是否属实。塔基蒂在质问中指出，所有这些行动都是“公然侵犯司法机关的行政权”。
