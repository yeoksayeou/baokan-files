　　We Are Like One Person
　　Remembering the Soldiers Before the General Offensive on Taiyuan
　　Reporter's Account by Yuan Mingruan
　　[Special dispatch from our newspaper, Taiyuan Front, 22nd] Reporter Yuan Mingruan reports from the Taiyuan front: Upon arriving at the Taiyuan front, one immediately feels an immense power. The soldiers before the general offensive are in high spirits, yet also very clear-headed and calm. Every soldier can cite many specific conditions for achieving victory. Among these conditions, I believe the most important is that, based on conscious awareness, everyone has made precise preparations and engaged in close unity and mutual assistance. Facing the enemy's positions, various units, based on their assigned tasks and the current enemy situation and terrain, have launched a fervent training movement and conducted thorough inspections from top to bottom and from bottom to top. In one meeting, soldier Luo Zhangfu said, "Every time I throw a grenade, I always think of Yan Xishan's oppression of me. I can't wait to smash this 'Yan Jar' to pieces. The more I think like this, the more energetic and brave I become." This nineteen-year-old new recruit, in just five months, can now throw grenades forty-three meters. He has learned how to use explosives, how to use a bayonet, and everything a soldier should possess on the battlefield. In the training, the soldiers have a slogan: "If a knife is not sharp, sharpen it." Everyone strictly examines themselves and also examines each other. Soldier Yan Xishun stated, "My shortcomings are: first, I can't throw grenades as far as everyone else; second, I can't tie explosive packs tightly. I need to learn these two things from the squad leader. But I am very skilled in fuse connections and detonator installation. Zheng Laiwang is not confident in this area, and I can help him learn this." After identifying their shortcomings through inspection, the soldiers actively practiced to improve using this method of mutual assistance, constantly improving their tactics and techniques. The soldiers all said in unison, "This time we are confident in completing the plan because we have the determination and the ability. Things we didn't know in the past, we have now learned." I attended a company's democratic meeting to assess the tasks. All the commanders and fighters, gathered around a sand table, conducted a detailed study of the strengths and weaknesses of each platoon and squad, as well as the combat experience, training results, ideological state, and physical strength of each individual. Based on these analyses, the leadership then specifically assigned tasks to each platoon, squad, and even individual. They considered various situations, studied various ways of fighting, and how to learn from each other's strengths and make up for weaknesses to help each other. This approach may seem ordinary, but it is the most reliable guarantee of victory in battle. In the combat plans made by the soldiers, there is always this clause: we must unite well with fraternal units. They stipulated many specific measures, such as: not competing for spoils of war on the battlefield, actively cooperating in combat, and taking on the most difficult tasks ourselves. In a squad meeting, soldier Zeng Shiying said, "Now you see we have so many cannons, and these are all the result of our united struggle under the leadership of Chairman Mao." He saw his own cannons, saw his own strength, and also knew why he had this strength. On a company wall newspaper, there was an article about uniting fraternal units, in which there were two sentences that read: "The People's Liberation Army is one family, class brothers are close and dear." How great is this spirit, how profound are these feelings. Now, the army is gathering under the city of Taiyuan. In addition to the fraternal units fighting in the North China battlefield, there are also the Northwest Field Army fighting hard and the powerful Northeast Artillery. In terms of numbers, this is an army of hundreds of thousands, but in spirit, I deeply feel that it is like one person – this is the greatest giant in the world, and the power emanating from this giant will surely be invincible and unconquerable.

　　我们象一个人一样
  　记总攻太原前的战士们
    记者口  袁明阮
    【本报太原前线二十二日电】太原前线记者袁明阮报导：一到太原前线，马上就使人感到一种无穷的力量：总攻前的战士们，情绪是十分高昂的，同时又是十分清醒与冷静的，每个战士都能举出许多取得胜利的具体条件，在这些条件当中，我认为最重要的一条，就是在自觉的基础之上每个人都进行了精确的准备与亲密的团结互助，面对着敌人的阵地，各个部队根据自己所受领的任务及当前的敌情、地形，展开了热烈的练兵运动，并且进行了自上而下与自下而上的深入检查，在一次会议上，战士罗章福这样说：“每当我打一颗手榴弹，总要想想阎锡山对于我的压迫，恨不得一下打烂这个‘阎罐罐’，这样越打越有劲，越打越勇敢。”这个十九岁的新战士，在短短五个月以内，现在投弹能投四十三米，学会了爆炸，学会了刺枪，学会了一个战士在战场上应该具备的一切本领。在练兵当中，战士们有一个口号叫做：“那把刀不快，磨那把刀。”每个人严格检查了自己，而又互相检查着，战士阎喜顺提出：“我的缺点：第一是投弹不如大家投的远，第二是捆炸药捆不紧，这两点要向班长学习。但是我在火具接连与雷管装置上很熟练，郑来旺在这方面没有把握，我可帮助他学会这一套。”战士们经过检查，发现了自己的缺点以后，就用这种互助办法积极补练，使自己的战术、技术得到不断的提高。战士们都异口同声地说：“这次我们有把握完成计划，因为我有决心，有本领，过去不会的东西，现在学会了。”我参加了一个连队民主评定任务的会议，全体指战人员围绕着沙盘，把每个排每个班的优缺点，以至每个人的战斗经验，练兵成绩，思想情绪与身体强弱都进行了详细的研究；根据这些分析，然后由领导上具体分配每个排、每个班、以至每个人的任务。他们考虑到各种情况，研究了各种各样的打法，以及如何取长补短互相帮助。这种做法看起来好象很平常，然而这都是战斗胜利最可靠的保证。在战士们所订的战斗计划中，都有这么一条：一定要与兄弟部队团结好。他们规定了许多具体办法，例如：在战场不争夺胜利品，战斗中积极配合，把最艰苦的任务放在自己身上等。在一个班的班务会上，战士曾士英说：“现在你看咱们有这么多的大炮，这都是咱们大家在毛主席领导之下团结斗争得来的。”他看到了自己的大炮，看到了自己的力量，而且知道为什么会有这种力量。在一个连队的墙报上，有一篇关于团结兄弟部队的稿子，其中有两句是这样写的：“天下人民解放军，阶级兄弟亲又亲”。这种气概多么伟大，这种情感多么深厚。现在，太原城下大军云集，这里除转战华北战场的兄弟部队外，还有艰苦奋战的西北野战军与强大的东北炮兵各一部，从数量上看，这是一支数十万人的大军，但在精神上，我深深体验到这好象是一个人一样——这是世界上最伟大的巨人，从这个巨人身上发出来的力量，必然是无坚不摧、无攻不克。
