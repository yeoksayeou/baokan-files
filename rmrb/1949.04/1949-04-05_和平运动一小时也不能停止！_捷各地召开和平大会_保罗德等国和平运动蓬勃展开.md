Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 3rd. TASS dispatch: The world movement to support peace is vigorously unfolding in countries such as Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria. The preparatory committee for the World Congress of Supporters of Peace in Czechoslovakia continues to receive resolutions from groups and letters from individuals across the country, expressing the unwavering will of the Czechoslovak people to strive for peace. A Public Committee for the Defense of Peace has been established in Bratislava (border between Czechoslovakia and Austria-Hungary), with representatives from various Czechoslovak parties, public organizations, and cultural groups.

In the northern city of Hradec Králové, a mass youth rally for the defense of peace was held on March 31st. Foreign Minister Clementis delivered a speech at the rally, pointing out that the strength of the peace and democracy camp led by the Soviet Union has an overwhelming advantage over the camp of instigators of new wars. He said: We will not stop the peace movement for even an hour. We will mobilize all forces to victoriously build socialism, thereby promoting the cause of peace and consolidating the strength of the peace and democracy camp. The participants telegraphed the preparatory committee for the World Congress of Supporters of Peace, expressing the readiness of Czech youth to do everything possible to defend peace and international friendship. On the same day, a thousand-person rally was also held in the central city of Brno. On March 30th, peasant women from the Jaroměř district passed a resolution at the district farmers' association meeting, stating: We resolutely condemn the imperialists who are preparing a new war. We wholeheartedly support the peace policies of the Soviet Union and the People's Democracies. Czechoslovak writers, composers, and women participating in cooperative organizations have also successively issued similar statements.

The People's Republic of Romania's Congress of Intellectuals in Support of Peace concluded on the 1st. The meeting passed a letter to the preparatory committee for the World Congress of Supporters of Peace, stating: Scientific, literary, and artistic workers of the People's Republic of Romania sincerely welcome the initiation of the World Congress of Supporters of Peace. The united struggle of freedom-loving people is capable of preventing war and thwarting the aggressive plans of American and British imperialism.

The movement to strive for lasting peace has also spread throughout Bulgaria. People in various parts of Bulgaria are holding meetings to express their firm protest against the evil plans of the American and British warmongers and to guarantee their support for the struggle for peace and cooperation among all nations. The Congress of the Bulgarian Writers' Union passed a resolution on March 31st, stating: Bulgarian writers will contribute all their strength to defend peace. The resolution of the National Lawyers' Conference of Bulgaria on March 30th stated: We firmly stand on the side of the progressive and peace-loving people of all countries, led by the Soviet Union.
