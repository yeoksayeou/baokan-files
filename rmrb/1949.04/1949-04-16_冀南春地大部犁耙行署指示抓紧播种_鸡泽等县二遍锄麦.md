　　【Jinan Telegram】The sowing season has arrived. In the Southern Hebei region, manure delivery, plowing, harrowing, and other tasks have been largely completed. Moreover, the spring rain has provided sufficient moisture in general. Based on these favorable conditions, the Southern Hebei Administrative Office issued instructions on April 9th, urging all subordinate units to seize the time and complete the sowing tasks. 1. The plan for promoting economic crops must be specifically implemented during sowing. This requires continuing to dispel the masses' ideological concerns, helping to solve specific difficulties, and paying attention to resolving the masses' concerns about insufficient rainfall preventing them from plowing the soil and applying base fertilizer. Introduce methods such as using drills to apply decomposed fertilizer or applying a thin layer first, followed by topdressing later. In disaster areas, it is necessary to call on the masses to grow more early-maturing crops such as melons and vegetables. 2. Mobilize the masses to select and soak seeds, publicize that selecting and soaking seeds can increase yields and prevent pests, and introduce specific methods. 3. Organizing the masses to sow must pay attention to organizing all labor, promoting human power in exchange for animal power, and unskilled work in exchange for technical skills. Promote women's participation in sowing, reward and commend active participants in sowing, and criticize the erroneous ideas of underestimating women's labor and women's unwillingness to participate in labor. Specifically organize sowing tools to ensure that drills are not idle when people are idle. Pay close attention to the sowing problems of families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers and the elderly and weak households. All government offices should use livestock to help families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers or the elderly and weak households with sowing. In arid areas, the masses should be organized to carry water for spot sowing, breaking the idea of relying on the heavens and waiting for rain. 4. Sowing is the center of all work and must be done in a timely manner.
    【Jinan News】The spring plowing preparations in ten counties, including Handan, in the Third Prefecture of Southern Hebei, have been largely completed. In Jize, except for some irrigated land in the first district, all spring land has been plowed once. In Wei County, 95% of the spring land has been plowed. In Yongnian, all spring land has been plowed once, and 58,900 mu have been plowed twice. Regarding wheat weeding, most of the wheat fields in Jize and Yongnian have been weeded once and have begun to be weeded a second time. In areas without the habit of weeding wheat, many people are also trying weeding. For example, one-third of the wheat fields in Wei County have been weeded. Regarding the planting of economic crops, the plans made by most villages in Chengci and Guangping exceeded the plans of the counties and districts. The masses in Yongnian plan to plant cotton in the wheat ridges to expand the cotton production area. In addition, during the spring plowing intervals, Yongnian also reclaimed 150 mu of cultivated wasteland and 430 mu of raw wasteland. The achievement of the above results is due to the fact that the Third Prefectural Committee has consistently implemented the style of opposing bureaucratic commandism in its leadership and emphasized in-depth mobilization of the masses. At the beginning of March, the Prefectural Committee discovered from the reports of various counties that the counties and districts were simply issuing orders to the masses to implement the economic crop planting plan. It immediately pointed out that this commandist approach would not be accepted by the masses and would inevitably fail. It emphasized that the implementation of all tasks and plans must be thoroughly arranged to each and every household, and after mobilization, it must become the masses' own plan so that the masses can complete it consciously. Cadres in various counties made inspections based on the instructions, and the work moved forward one step.

　　冀南春地大部犁耙行署指示抓紧播种
  　鸡泽等县二遍锄麦
    【冀南电】播种时节已到，冀南全区送粪、犁地、耙地等均已大部完成，且开春下了雨，水分一般够用，冀南行署据此有利条件，于四月九日指示所属，抓紧时机完成播种任务。一、推广经济作物计划要在播种中具体实现，这就须要继续解除群众思想顾虑，帮助解决具体困难，并应注意解决群众怕雨量小不敢翻土，不能施底肥的困难。介绍用耧沤肥，或先薄施，以后上追肥的办法。在灾区要号召群众多种瓜菜等早熟作物。二、动员群众选种、浸种，宣传选种浸种能多收、防虫，并介绍具体办法。三、组织群众播种，必须注意组织所有劳力，提倡人力换畜力，笨活换技术。提倡妇女参加播种，奖励和表扬参加播种的积极分子，批评轻视妇女劳动和妇女不愿参加劳动的错误思想。具体组织播种工具，作到人闲耧不闲。并十分注意烈军工属和老弱户的播种问题。各机关要以牲口帮助烈军工属或老弱户播种。在天旱地区应组织群众挑水点种。打破靠天吃饭，坐等下雨的思想。四、播种为一切工作的中心，要切实作到不违农时。
    【冀南讯】冀南三专区邯郸等十县的春耕准备工作已大体完成。鸡泽除一区部分水浇地外，其余春地全犁一遍。魏县百分之九十五的春地已犁过。永年春地都翻过一遍，且有五万八千九百亩犁过二遍。在锄麦方面，鸡泽、永年大部麦地锄过头遍，并开始锄二遍。没有锄麦习惯的地区，也有不少群众试锄，如魏县三分之一的麦地已锄过。在经济作物的种植上，成磁、广平大部村庄所订计划超过县、区计划，永年群众计划在麦垄里点种棉花，扩大棉产面积。此外，在春耕间隙，永年还开熟荒一百五十亩，生荒四百三十亩。上述成绩之获得，乃因三地委领导上贯穿了反对包办的官僚主义作风，强调深入发动群众。三月初地委从各县汇报中发现，县、区均以简单命令方法让群众执行种植经济作物计划，当即指出这种包办作法，群众不会接受，定遭失败。并强调指出一切任务、计划的贯彻，必须深入布置到各家各户，经过动员，变成群众自己的计划，使群众自觉完成。各县干部依据指示，均作了检查，工作前进了一步。
