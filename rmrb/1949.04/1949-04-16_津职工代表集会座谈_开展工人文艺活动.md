　　【Tianjin Electric】Over one hundred employee representatives from more than seventy enterprises and factories in Tianjin gathered on the 10th for a discussion on further developing workers' cultural activities. At the discussion, Chen Huangmei, Director of the Cultural Department of the Military Control Commission, based on the experiences and opinions shared by the representatives regarding cultural activities in factories, proposed the purpose of carrying out factory cultural activities: to enhance workers' class consciousness, strengthen worker unity, stimulate production enthusiasm, and support the front lines, in order to accelerate the arrival of national victory. This is the standard by which the success of factory cultural activities is measured. Factory cultural activities should preferably adopt small-scale, decentralized organizational forms. More short and concise performances should be organized. New Yangko dances, dramas, and songs should be promoted. Workers who like Peking Opera should also be encouraged to rehearse plays with new content. Furthermore, the principle of conscious voluntarism must be adhered to, and the direction of workers "writing about themselves, acting as themselves; performing about themselves, for themselves" should be promoted.

　　津职工代表集会座谈
  　开展工人文艺活动
    【天津电】津市七十余企业工厂的百余名职工代表于十日集会座谈进一步开展工人文艺活动。座谈会上军管会文艺处处长陈荒煤根据各代表所谈在工厂中进行文艺活动的经验和意见提出开展工厂文艺活动的目的，在提高工人的阶级觉悟，加强工人团结，激发生产热忱，支援前线，以加速全国胜利的到来，这是工厂文艺活动有无成绩的标准。工厂的文艺活动以采取小型的、分散的组织形式较好，应多组织短小精悍的演出，应提倡新的秧歌剧、话剧、歌咏等，对某些喜爱平剧的工人也应推动他们排演新内容的戏，并须应以自觉自愿为原则，提倡工人“自己写，写自己；自己演，演自己”的方向。
