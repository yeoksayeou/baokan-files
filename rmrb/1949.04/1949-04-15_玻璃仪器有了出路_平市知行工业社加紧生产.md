Glass Instruments Find a Way Out
	Ping City Zhixing Industrial Cooperative Speeds Up Production

[Report from this newspaper] The Zhixing Industrial Cooperative in this city is famous in North China for manufacturing glass instruments. Its business was most developed from 1944 to 1945, when it could produce one and a half tons of glass per day. After the Japanese surrender, during the Kuomintang's rule, it declined due to the destruction of cultural and educational undertakings, and almost no one asked about glass instruments. The factory struggled to survive, relying only on selling kerosene lamp shades and roughly made bottles. After the liberation of Beiping, cultural institutions in Jinnan, Henan, Yan'an, Zhangjiakou, Shenyang, Changchun and other places sent people to the factory to order glass instruments. All the workers of the factory are working together to improve the quality. In terms of heat resistance, acid resistance and alkali resistance, they want to catch up with world standards. Currently, it can make half a ton of glass per day. With better raw materials and sales channels, it will not be a problem to restore the past output soon.

### 玻璃仪器有了出路　平市知行工业社加紧生产

　　玻璃仪器有了出路
  　平市知行工业社加紧生产
    【本报讯】本市知行工业社以制造玻璃仪器驰名华北，一九四四年至一九四五年营业最为发达，每日可作一吨半玻璃。日本投降后在国民党统治时期，因文化教育事业遭摧残而衰落，玻璃仪器几无人问津。该厂惨淡经营，仅赖售卖煤油灯罩和质地粗糙的瓶子来苟延。北平解放后，冀南、河南、延安、张家口、沈阳、长春等地文化机关，纷纷派人至该厂订制玻璃仪器。该厂职工全体一致努力，决心要把质量提高。在耐热耐酸耐碱方面，要赶上世界标准。现每日可作半吨玻璃。在原料及销路较好的情况下，不久恢复过去产量是没有问题的。
