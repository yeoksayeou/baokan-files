　　Seventy Ordnance Factory Worker Correspondents
　　Enthusiastically Offer Suggestions to Improve This Newspaper
　　[This Newspaper's Report] In the past two days, this newspaper invited worker correspondents from the Seventy Ordnance Factory to visit our office and held a discussion meeting with them. The worker correspondents, with the attitude of cherishing their own newspaper, offered many valuable suggestions to this newspaper.
　　Comrade Song Yansheng said: "There should be more things reflecting the workers' side in this city. There are not many reports on the workers' lives and production in other cities in North China, as well as the workers' production situation in the liberated areas such as the Northeast and Northwest. We very much need to know the work attitude of workers in other regions, because we want to learn from them."
　　Sun Jingui said: "The newspaper should encourage the opening of more factories. Beijing has more than two million people, only 200,000 of whom are directly involved in production, and the rest are consumers. However, some people are unemployed and factories should be opened to absorb them and transform Beijing."
　　Comrade Gan Chengxian said: "The articles on the fourth page are too long. More short and concise articles should be published. Some long articles can be published, but they don't have to be published all at once and can be published continuously. Now some comrades feel: when will this long article be finished reading?"
　　Comrade Liu Shaohua said: "We really need war correspondence to know how our soldiers are bravely eliminating the enemy at the front, which is of great benefit to us."
　　Comrade Yao Xin said: "There are not many reports on the life of overseas Chinese in international news. International reporting is also a struggle between two fronts, and I hope to do more reporting on it."
　　"The advertisements and the titles of some articles should be smaller, so that space can be left for publishing more other news."
　　Worker Li Boren said: "In the future development of industry, a technical Q&A column should be set up to improve workers' skills. The Arithmetic Mailbox should continue to be published."
　　They also have some opinions on distribution work: can there be preferential treatment for workers; worker subscribers hope that they do not have to pay the newspaper fee themselves, but that newspaper vendors can collect it on their behalf; because they are very busy with their work.

### 七十兵工厂工人通讯员　热情提意见改进本报

　　七十兵工厂工人通讯员
  　热情提意见改进本报
    【本报讯】近两日来，本报邀请了七十兵工厂工人通讯员来本报参观，并与他们举行座谈会，工人通讯员同志们都以爱护自己报纸的态度对本报提出不少宝贵意见。
    宋燕生同志说：“在本市反映工人方面的东西要多些，其他华北各城市的工人生活、生产以及东北、西北等解放区的工人生产情形报导的也不多，我们非常需要知道其他地区工人的劳动态度等情况、因为我们要向他们学习。”
    孙金贵说：“报纸应该鼓励多开工厂，北平有二百多万人口，仅有二十万直接参加生产的，其他都是消费者，但是有一部分人没有职业，应该开工厂吸收他们进来，改造北平市。”
    甘承显同志说：“四版文章太长，应多登些短小精悍的文章，有些长文章可以登，但不一定一次登完可连续登载，现在有些同志感到：这长的文章什么时候才能看完呢。”
    刘少华同志说：“我们很需要战地通讯，知道我们的战士在前方如何艰苦英勇的消灭敌人，这些对我们有很大好处。”
    姚欣同志说：“国际新闻里关于华侨的生活情形看到的不多。国际报导也是两个阵线的斗争，希望能够多做些报导。”
    “那些广告和有的文章的标题要小一些，这样可留出版面，更多的登载其他新闻。”
    工人李博仁说：“今后发展工业，应该设技术问答栏，提高工人的技术。算学信箱应继续登载。”
    他们对发行工作也有些意见：能不能对工人优待；工人订户希望不要亲自去交报费，可由报贩代收；因为他们工作很忙。
