To the Working Men and Women of the World:

The Executive Committee of the World Federation of Trade Unions assures the workers of all countries that this great world trade union organization, the first of its kind in history, is continuing and will continue to defend the interests of workers in all countries.

Workers have learned of an attempt to destroy the World Federation of Trade Unions, an attempt that was revealed during the Executive Bureau meeting of the World Federation of Trade Unions, which began on January 17 of this year.

The motivations behind this attempt are clearly unrelated to the interests of workers and are in absolute violation of the fundamental principles of international solidarity.

When the Executive Committee of the World Federation of Trade Unions calls upon the workers of the world, it understands that some of them may have been pulled out of the World Federation of Trade Unions without their consent. We know that even in the United States and Britain, many trade union members retain their belief in the World Federation of Trade Unions. Whether it was correct for the leaders of the Trades Union Congress and the Congress of Industrial Organizations to withdraw from the Executive Bureau meeting of the World Federation of Trade Unions on January 19 was not even consulted with the workers of the United States and Britain.

Workers around the world should understand who bears the heavy responsibility for disrupting the international trade union cooperation between the various national trade unions within the World Federation of Trade Unions, a cooperation that existed universally within the organization.

Throughout 1948, they first created many difficulties in the Executive Bureau and the Executive Committee of the World Federation of Trade Unions. This hindered our organization's work in establishing industrial departments, convening Asian trade union conferences, and fulfilling the resolutions of the Prague Council regarding the situation of German trade unions. They used ultimatums to deal with the Executive Bureau and the Executive Committee. They wanted to force their will, believing that only they were ardent trade unionists and true democrats. Since their withdrawal from the Executive Bureau and their effective refusal to convene the World Trade Union Congress, they have confirmed that their statements cannot be believed. The Congress is the highest democratic institution of our world trade union. Here, national trade union organizations, in the name of the organized workers they represent, exercise their highest rights.

The Executive Committee was placed in a dilemma: either it had to halt the life of the World Federation of Trade Unions, which would be equivalent to destroying it; subsequently, a lifeless "custodial" committee of five members could maintain useless contact; or reject the proposal to cease the activities of the World Federation of Trade Unions, in which case those who proposed it would withdraw from the World Federation of Trade Unions.

The Executive Committee neither approved of the first proposal nor the second attitude. The Executive Committee's decision was not to halt the activities of the World Federation of Trade Unions, but to advise all organizations that might be persuaded: if this is their sincere and genuine wish, they still have their place in the ranks of the World Federation of Trade Unions, just as they did before.

The Executive Committee decided to convene the Second World Trade Union Congress. In the current circumstances, this Congress is of utmost importance. It will study the trade union situation that has developed around the world and will establish methods and directions for developing the World Federation of Trade Unions and the economic and social demands of the working men and women of all countries.

The Executive Committee calls on all national trade unions that have joined the World Federation of Trade Unions to pay attention to the preparations for the Second World Trade Union Congress and to assist the World Federation of Trade Unions in all aspects, so that the Congress can successfully complete its tasks.

Regarding the establishment of industrial departments within the World Federation of Trade Unions, the Executive Committee also made a very important resolution. It once again urges the international trade secretariats to cooperate with the World Federation of Trade Unions in a spirit of broad industrial solidarity to establish industrial departments. The industrial departments must engage in serving the urgent industrial interests of all sectors of production and must include workers of all countries without discrimination.

The Executive Committee also studied the situation of trade unions in Asian and Latin American countries and passed important resolutions aimed at providing effective assistance from the World Federation of Trade Unions to trade unions in these countries.

At present, it is more important than ever to consolidate the solidarity of workers around the world and to develop and strengthen the World Federation of Trade Unions.

During the Second World War, the working class shed blood and contributed significantly to the military defeat of fascism. The great sacrifices made by the working class in the struggle against the most barbaric forms of oppression must not be in vain. The working class, united with the democratic forces of the world, has the right to hope for a better and happier life. Only democratic forces united on a worldwide scale can build such a life. The working class can and must become the backbone of these forces.

The World Federation of Trade Unions is an organization representing workers from all countries of the world. It defends their interests without discrimination. Although special circumstances exist in each country, workers in all countries of the world, regardless of their race, political or religious beliefs, have their common interests and goals. During the Second World War, the main task was to defeat fascism; now it is to build a new world free from want, hunger, and unemployment, a world that guarantees all workers wages commensurate with the wealth they create. The rights and freedoms of trade unions must be guaranteed and expanded, and legislation on social protection must also be guaranteed.

The World Federation of Trade Unions supports the people of colonial and semi-colonial countries who are fighting for their independence and living conditions because they have an inalienable right to freedom and self-determination.

The World Federation of Trade Unions is fighting to eradicate the adverse effects of trusts and monopolies on the social, economic, and political life of the world. The World Federation of Trade Unions is assisting democratic forces to eliminate fascist regimes and forces that still exist in some countries and constitute a constant threat to peace.

The World Federation of Trade Unions is fighting for and will fight to ensure a solid and lasting peace among all nations, and the World Federation of Trade Unions will condemn those who attempt to incite a new world war.

The Executive Committee calls on workers to strengthen and support the World Federation of Trade Unions in order to help it achieve its goals of peace and social progress.

To this end, national trade union organizations must fight to consolidate their trade union solidarity at the national level. To this end, the activities of the world trade union organization must be strengthened, which is an important factor in international trade union solidarity.

The Executive Committee declares that nothing can separate the workers of all countries. It especially calls on British and American workers to support the World Federation of Trade Unions. There are no fundamental divisions or reasons for hatred among workers in Britain, the United States, France, Italy, China, the Soviet Union, or any other country.

When their cooperation is based on goodwill and a spirit of mutual cooperation, and there is no attempt to seek hegemony, harmony between them is always possible.

The entire history of workers and trade union life shows that the most effective weapon in the hands of workers to ensure their liberation is their unity. To destroy unity is to destroy this weapon. This is what the enemies of the working class seek at every moment. This has always been the aim of capitalist forces.

Working men and women, the Executive Committee calls on you:

Use your strength to build a better world!

Engage in relentless activity for the victory of your economic and professional demands!

Fight for your trade union and democratic rights and freedoms!

Unite against all attempts to lead the world into a new war!

Unite to ensure a solid and lasting peace among all nations!

Unite to defend international trade union solidarity by supporting the World Federation of Trade Unions!

### 世界工联执行委员会告全世界工人书

　　世界工联执行委员会告全世界工人书
    陈舜琼  译劳动男女们：
    世界职工联合会执行委员会向全世界工人保证，这向所未有的第一个伟大的世界职工会组织正在继续并将继续保卫一切国家工人的利益。
    工人们已得知一个目的在于摧毁工人的世界职工会组织的企图，这企图在今年一月十七日开始的世界工联执行局会议的过程中显露出来。
    这个企图所根据的动机，显然对工人的利益全无关系，并绝对违反了国际团结的基本原则。
    工联执委会在向全世界工人号召时，了解到他们其中一部分，可能未得他们同意而被拉出世界职工联合会。我们知道，甚至在英美有许多职工会会员对世界职工联合会保有他们的信念。关于职工大会及产联的领导者在今年一月十九日退出工联执行局会议一事，是否正确，亦未与英美工人磋商。
    全世界工人应当了解，谁在今年一月破坏了普遍存在于工联内部的世界各全国性的职工会之间的国际职工会的合作，谁就要负重责。
    在整个一九四八年内，他们首先在工联执行局和执委会中制造了许多困难。这样阻碍了我们的组织建立产业部，召开亚洲职工会议，以及履行布拉格理事会有关德国职工会情况的决议的工作。他们利用最后通牒以应付执行局和执委会。他们想强制实现他们的意志；认为只有他们是热诚的职工运动者和真正的民主分子。自从他们退出执行局，实际上拒绝召开世界职工代表大会，他们证实了自己的言论，不能令人相信。代表大会是我们世界职工会民主的最高机构。在这里各国职工会组织，以其所代表的有组织的工人的名义，运用它们最高的权利。
    执委会被处于进退两难的地位：或者它必须停止工联的生命，这等于使之消灭；随后，毫无生气的“保管”委员会五委员之间或可保持无用的联系；或者否决停止工联活动的提议，这样提议的人就要退出工联。
    执委会既不赞成第一个提议，亦不赞成第二个态度。执委会的决议是不停止工联的活动，而是劝告所有可能被说服的组织：如果这是他们诚恳真正的愿望，现在他们仍和从前一样，皆在世界职工联合会的队伍中有其地位。
    执委会决定召开第二次世界职工代表大会。在目前情况下，该大会有非常的重要性。它将研究在全世界形成的职工会情况，并将建立发展工联以及各国劳动男女的经济与社会要求的方法与方向。
    执委会号召加入工联的一切全国性的职工会，注意筹备第二次世界职工代表大会，在各方面协助工联，以便大会可以胜利的完成任务。
    关于建立世界职工联合会产业部，执委会亦做了一个很重要的决议。它再度敦促国际职业工会秘书处，以广泛的产业团结精神与工联合作建立产业部。产业部须从事于服务各生产部门的产业上的迫切利益，并须无歧视的包括各国工人。
    执委会亦研究了亚洲及拉丁美洲各国职工会的情况，并通过重要决议，目的在于工联给予这些国家职工会以有效的援助。
    目前，巩固全世界工人的团结，与发展并加强世界职工联合会，较以往是更为紧要了。
    第二次世界大战期间，工人阶级流血出力，对在军事上击败法西斯主义做了有力的贡献。在反对最野蛮的压迫形式的斗争中，工人阶级所做的重大牺牲，必须不是需要的。与全世界民主力量在一齐的工人阶级，有权利希望有一个较好的和较快乐的生活。只有在全世界范围内团结起来的民主力量，才能建立这样的生活。工人阶级能够并且必须成为这些力量的骨干。
    世界职工联合会是代表世界各国职工的组织。它无歧视的保卫他们的利益。纵然每一国家存在有特殊的情况，世界各国职工不论种族、政治或宗教观念有何不同，有他们共同的利益及目标。第二次世界大战期间，主要的任务在于击溃法西斯主义，现在则在于建立一个无虞匮乏、饥饿、失业的新世界，一个向一切工人保证符合其所创造的财富的工资的世界。必须保证并扩大职工会的权利和自由，也必须保证有关社会保护的立法。
    世界职工联合会支持殖民地半殖民地的人民，他们因为对自由自决有不可丧失的权利，正为其独立与生活条件而奋斗。
    工联正为根绝托辣斯及垄断资本对全世界社会、经济及政治生活的恶劣影响而斗争。工联正在协助民主力量消灭法西斯政权与法西斯力量，这些法西斯政权与力量仍存在于某些国家，并形成对和平的经常威胁。
    工联正为并将要为保证各民族间巩固持久的和平而斗争，工联将谴责企图煽动世界新战争的人们。
    执委会号召工人们，以协助工联达到和平与社会进步的目的，日益加强工联，支持工联。
    为此，各国职工会组织必需在全国范围内，为巩固其职工会的团结而奋斗。为此，必需加强全世界职工会组织的活动，这是国际职工会团结的重要因素。
    执委会宣称什么都不能分隔一切国家的工人。它特别号召英美工人拥护世界职工联合会。在英、美、法、意、中、苏或任何其它国家的工人中间，没有基本的分歧，也没有仇恨的理由。
    当他们的合作是基于善意和互相合作的精神，并且没有称王道霸的企图时，他们之间是永远可能协调的。
    工人和职工会生活的全部历史昭示：在工人手中为保证他们的解放而斗争的最有效的武器，是在于他们的团结。破坏团结就是破坏这个武器。这就是工人阶级的敌人时时刻刻所企求的。这一向是资本主义力量的目的。
    劳动男女们，执委会号召你们：
    发挥你们的力量建立一个更好的世界！
    为你们经济和职业要求的胜利进行无休止的活动！
    为你们的职工会和民主权利和自由而斗争！
    团结起来反对将世界引向新战争的一切企图！
    团结起来保证各民族间的巩固持久的和平！
    团结起来，以拥护世界职工联合会来保卫国际职工会的团结！
