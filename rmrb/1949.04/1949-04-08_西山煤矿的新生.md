　　The Rebirth of the Xishan Coal Mine

　　Li Chunjiao
    Since the resumption of work at the Mentougou Xishan Coal Mine on January 1st, it has achieved rapid progress by the end of March. According to statistics, the output in January was 6733.8 tons (when everything was not yet ready), which already exceeded the 6,400 tons in November last year.
　　Monthly output increased from 6,400 tons to more than 10,000 tons
    In February, not only did the output increase to 7928.7 tons, but the underground engineering also developed considerably. In March, the estimated monthly output was 90 tons, but it actually produced 10,558 tons. In terms of individual labor efficiency, the daily output before liberation was 0.43 tons, and now it is 0.7 tons. The reasons for the increase in output are: First, the contract labor system was abolished. During the enemy puppet and Kuomintang rule, all underground projects, such as stacking, tunneling, coal mining, propping, shed building, and rock breaking, were contracted by the contract labor bosses recommended by the government. The workers were slaves hired by the contract labor bosses. All project costs were paid by the mine to the contract labor bosses according to the progress of the project. The workers' meager wages were deducted by the contract labor bosses, and the payments were delayed. By the time the money arrived, it had lost its original purchasing power. After liberation, the manager of the contract labor boss fled in fear of punishment, and the remaining workers immediately formed brother teams (today's production groups), directly led by skilled veteran workers. The use of materials, the distribution of wages, and the progress of projects are all directly discussed by the production groups and the mine. Workers receive their daily wages and are no longer subject to intermediate exploitation.
　　Four cornbread buns turned into twelve or thirteen catties of millet
    Second, wage adjustments and improvement of living conditions. During the Kuomintang rule, a day's labor was not worth four cornbread buns. Workers often worked overtime continuously for sixteen hours, or even twenty-four hours, without getting enough to eat. Today, the workers have turned themselves around. Eight hours of work can earn twelve or thirteen catties of millet, which not only improves their own lives but also solves the family's livelihood.
    Those injured on duty receive treatment and are given recuperation or living expenses according to the severity of the injury. This is unlike the indifferent attitude of the Kuomintang era.
    Third, political and cultural learning has raised the workers' awareness, and work has become more active. The workers said, "Today, this is our own mine. The project must be done well, materials must be saved, and more coal must be produced."
　　Skilled workers eagerly taught their "tricks" to others
    Fourth, mutual learning to improve skills: In the past, the "tricks" of masters and skilled workers were almost never taught to others, for fear of losing their jobs. Today, with the guarantee of workers' lives, and the recognition that workers are one family, they are all enthusiastically teaching their skills and experience to others. In the dormitory of the coal miners, at night, one often hears the elderly talking about many ingenious methods of underground coal mining, drilling, and blasting. Those who teach are enthusiastic, and those who learn are also very interested. As a result, skills are improved step by step, and output will increase accordingly.
　　Workers participate in production meetings
    Fifth, the establishment of a democratic system: Now every worker can express opinions on their work and on the administration of the mine, and an underground production meeting is held every ten days. The leaders of each production group represent their group to attend the meeting, and the underground staff of the mine also participate. The formulation of projects, the calculation of labor prices, the use of materials, and all management issues are all raised, discussed, and decided for implementation at the meeting.
    However, some problems still need to be studied today. For example, the wages of coal miners have not been set according to the quality of skills and the degree of proficiency, and the wages of surface workers have not been reasonably adjusted.
    April is a production competition month, and all employees are preparing to contribute more output to the people to welcome the great May Day Labor Day. The above problems should be studied and resolved quickly.

　　西山煤矿的新生
    薄更明
  　厉春蛟
    门头沟西山煤矿自一月一日复工以来，至三月底，工作获得突飞猛进的成绩。据统计，一月份的产量是六七三三·八吨（当是一切都尚未就绪），这个数目就已超过了去年十一月份的六千四百余吨。 　 月产量从六千四百吨增到一万多吨
    二月份不但产量增加到七九二八·七吨，井下工程也发展了不少。三月份估计月产九十吨，却产了一万零五百五十八吨。就各个人的劳动效率说，解放前日产○·四三吨，现在是○·七吨。产量增高的原因：一是取消了包工制度，在敌伪及国民党统治时期，井下一切工程，如垒垛、掘进、采煤、支柱、架棚、打石等，均由官方保荐的包工柜承包，工人是包工柜所雇用的奴役。一切工程费用，按照工程进展，由矿方扫数交与包工柜，工人所赚一点工资，包工柜还要从中克扣，且迟迟不发。钱到了手，已失去了原有的购买力。解放之后，包工柜的经理畏罪溜跑，留矿的职工立即组成了兄弟班（即今日之生产小组），由熟练的老工人直接领导。材料的使用，工资的发放，工程的进展，都由生产小组与矿上直接商讨。工人每日领取自己的工资，不再受中间剥削了。 　 四个窝窝头变成了十二三斤小米
    二、工资调整与生活改善。国民党统治时期，一天的劳动所得，不值四个窝窝头。工人时常在井下连续加班工作十六小时，甚至二十四小时，也不得温饱。今天工人翻了身，八小时的工作可得到十二三斤小米，不但改善了自己的生活，也解决了家庭的生活。
    因公受伤的，除治疗外，还按轻重给疗养或生活费用。不象国民党时代不管不问的态度了。
    三、政治文化的学习中，提高了工人的觉悟，工作便更加积极起来。工人们说：“今天是咱自己的矿，工程作好，材料要省，出煤要多。” 　 熟练工人的“高着”都热心教给了旁人
    四、互相学习提高技术：从前师傅及熟练工人的“高着”，差不多，都不愿意教别人，怕丢了自己的饭碗。今天工人生活有了保障，认识了工人是一家人，都把自己的手艺和经验热心的教给别人。在采煤工的宿舍里，夜间常常听到老年人讲说井下采煤、打眼、放炮的许多巧妙方法。教的人热心，学的人兴趣也大，由此技术一步步提高，产量也会因之更加大了。 　 工人参加生产会议
    五、民主制度的建立：现在每一工人，都可以对自己的工作、对矿上的行政提出意见，并且每旬要召开一次井下生产会议。各生产小组组长代表其小组参加会议，矿上的井下工作人员也都参加。工程的拟定，工价的核算，材料的使用，以及一切管理问题，都在会议上大家提出，商讨决定执行。
    不过今天有些问题还须继续研究。如：采煤之工资未能依照技术之优劣与熟练程度而订定，里工工资尚未得到合理调整等。
    四月份是生产竞赛月，职工全体准备以更多的产量供献给人民，以迎接伟大的五一劳动节。以上问题应该赶快研究解决。
