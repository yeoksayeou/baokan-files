In long-term poverty and persecution, the women of Dajin have mastered a full range of farming skills and are now operating for their own happiness.

The women of Dajin Village in Ding County have traditionally participated in field production, and are now a vital force on the village's production front. Not only do all the women in the village participate in field production, but they have also learned one or more major agricultural techniques: No one doesn't know how to crank a waterwheel to irrigate the garden; 80 percent of the women are proficient in hoeing and driving carts; 20 percent can put down manure and start compost piles; half can thin seedlings (with a hoe); and they have also learned how to plow and level the land.

Every year at the beginning of spring, the women of this village go to the fields. Those with waterwheels watch the ridges, do needlework, and take care of children. Those without waterwheels crank the waterwheels. "Who doesn't know how to hoe and drive a cart? They can do it without even looking!" they proudly said at the women's production forum. When it comes to hoeing, all the women go to the fields. The four able-bodied women in Liu Lao Zhi's family hoe as well as the men. The strong woman Jia Yuxiang mainly relies on herself to hoe her fourteen mu of land.

Speaking of driving livestock, whether donkeys or horses, hauling soil and manure, visiting relatives, or going to the market, they can harness, drive, load, and unload themselves. Zhang Lingxiu, the eleven-year-old daughter of Zhen Xiangyun, the organizing committee member of the Women's Federation, learned to drive a cart. In terms of farming and doing technical work, they have also made great progress in recent years. The young woman Zhang Yunduan is famous for her skill in thinning seedlings. She thins small seedlings quickly and well, and no one can compare to her. Plowing, leveling, and sowing are all major tasks, especially leveling, which is not easy to learn. If it is not leveled well, the garden will flood when irrigated. In the village, not knowing how to level is not considered a complete skill. However, thirteen women, including women Party members Liu Zhanyu and women's association member Meng Xiaozhen, have learned how to level the land. Eleven people, including Zhang Qiuling and Wang Ximei, have learned how to plow the land. Two people, including Liu Ximei, have learned all the farming skills.

Their path of participating in agricultural production has gone through countless hardships and tribulations. In the twelfth year of the Republic of China, 42 of the 78 households in the village were begging for food, and 90 percent of the households were poor tenant farmers. Hunger forced the women to participate in irrigating and planting, freeing up the men to earn money outside to make ends meet. Some women also "contracted" to irrigate gardens for others, earning some wages to make a living. At that time, women only knew how to irrigate gardens, and some knew how to hoe. After the War of Resistance Against Japan, due to the enemy's frequent conscription, young and middle-aged men were forced to flee, and Party cadres had to operate in hiding for a long time. Therefore, the women who were family members of Party cadres took on the task of field production first. Seven or eight women Party members, including Zhen Xiangyun and Liu Fengzhuo, became active members on the production front, encouraging all the women in the village to participate in production. They said, "Aren't women the same? What work can't people do!" After the land reform, the landlord's more than four qing of land "returned to their old home" and were distributed to poor farmers, greatly encouraging the women's enthusiasm for production. At the women's forum a few days ago, people said in unison: "In the past, production was 'people feeding the land,' fattening the landlords year after year; now it is 'the land feeding the people,' and all the production is our own, no longer exploited by the landlords. We must work harder in this year's great production, produce and prosper to support the front line!" In order to respond to the government's call to plant cotton, peanuts, and increase grain production, the women Party members and cadres in the village have held family meetings and made preliminary production plans. According to the production plans of four women Party members, including Zhen Xiangyun, the area planted with cotton accounts for 29.3 percent of the total cultivated area, an increase of nearly four times compared to last year; the area planted with peanuts accounts for 21.55 percent of the total cultivated area, an increase of one time compared to last year. The area they sow with cash crops exceeds the county's requirements. Since the beginning of spring, all the women in the village have actively participated in this year's great production by hauling soil, transporting manure, planting garlic, and hoeing wheat.

　　会耕耘的妇女
    在长期穷困、迫害中，大津妇女掌握了全套庄稼活，而今为自己的幸福操作着。
    定县大津村的妇女，过去即有参加田间生产的习惯，现在已成为全村生产战线上的一支生力军。该村全体妇女不仅参加田间生产，而且都学会了一种或几种主要农业技术：拧辘辘浇园，没有一个不会；锄地、驶车百分之八十的妇女都很熟练；下圈起粪者占百分之二十；能挖苗的（锄头遍）占半数；耕地、平地等活也已学会了。
    每年一开春，这村妇女们就都下地了。有水车的看着畦，捎带做针线，带孩子，没水车的就拧辘辘。“谁不会锄地驶车呀？脚踢手不拉就做了。”她们在妇女生产座谈会上骄傲的这样说。每到锄地的时候，妇女通统下地。刘老栀家四个青壮年妇女，锄地不落在男子后面。壮年妇女贾玉祥，十四亩地主要靠自己锄。
    说到驶牲口，不论驴、马，拉土拉粪、串亲、赶集，她们都能自套、自赶、自装、自卸。妇联会组织委员甄香云的闺女张苓绣十一岁就学会驶车。她们在种地做技术活上，近几年来也有很大进步。青年妇女张云端以会锄苗著名。她锄小苗又快又好，谁也比不上。耕地、平地、耩地都是大活，尤其平地不易学会，若是平不好，浇园就要跑水。在村里，不会平地不算全活。可是，妇女党员刘占玉、妇会会员孟小珍等十三人都学会了平地。张秋领、王喜梅等十一人学会了耕地。刘喜梅等二人学会了全套庄稼活。
    她们这一段参加农业生产的道路，曾经历了数不尽的艰苦和磨难。民国十二年，全村七十八户中，有四十二户要饭吃，百分之九十的户是贫苦的佃农，饥饿逼迫得妇女们开始参加了浇园种地，腾出男子到外面挣个钱来填补日月。有的妇女还给人家“包干”浇园，挣点工资来糊口。当时妇女只会浇园，一部份妇女会锄地。抗战后由于敌人经常抓丁，青壮年被迫流亡，党员干部得长期隐蔽活动。于是党员干部家属的妇女，首先担当起田间生产劳动。妇女党员甄香云、刘凤镯等七八人首先成了生产战线上的积极分子，她们鼓励着全村妇女参加了生产。她们说：“娘们不是一样吗？什么活不是人干的！”土改后，地主的四顷多地“回了老家”，分配给贫苦农民了，大大鼓舞了妇女们的生产情绪。前几天开的妇女座谈会上，人们异口同声地说：“过去生产是‘人养地’，一年一年的把地主养得胖胖的；现在是‘地养人’，生产多少都是自己的，不再受地主的剥削了。今年大生产更得努力干，生产发家好支援前线哪！”为了响应政府种棉花、花生、增产粮食的号召，该村妇女党员干部都开了家庭会，作了初步生产计划。根据甄香云等四个妇女党员的生产计划统计，种棉占总耕地面积的百分之二十九点三，比去年增加近四倍；种花生占总耕地面积的百分之二十一点五五，比去年增加一倍。她们播种经济作物的面积，都超过了县里的要求。开春以来，全村妇女拉土、送粪、种蒜、锄麦，都积极投入了今年的大生产。　　　　　（冀中分社）
