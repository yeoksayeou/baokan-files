Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 5th: TASS, 4th: The Italian working masses continue their intense struggle, demanding improved working conditions and increased wages. Workers at the Fiat factories in Turin have been employing "non-cooperation" measures for nearly two months because the factory refused to increase wages, and have also held "checkerboard-style" strikes, individually stopping work at different times, causing the output of these factories to fall by twenty to thirty-five percent. In mid-February, workers in the Italian chemical industry also joined the struggle because industrialists refused to continue negotiations for the conclusion of new collective contracts. The "non-cooperation" movement has spread to industries such as rubber, coca (narcotic), fats, soaps, and artificial fibers. On April 2, Italian bank employees also went on strike in support of their demands for increased wages. Employees of the National Social Insurance Bureau and its branches have been on strike for two weeks. A few days ago, the province of Parma held a 24-hour strike to protest the closure of nine enterprises in the province in retaliation for "non-cooperation."

  　争取改善劳动条件和增资
    【新华社北平五日电】塔斯社四日讯：意大利工人群众继续紧张的斗争，要求改善劳动条件和增加工资。都灵费亚特工厂工人因厂方拒绝增加工资，采取“不合作”办法为时已近两月，并且举行了“棋盘式”罢工，由不同时间各别地停止工作，使这些工厂的出产跌落了百分之二十到三十五。二月中旬，由于工业家拒绝继续进行缔结新集体合同的谈判，意大利化学工业的工人也参加了斗争。“不合作”运动扩及了橡皮、哥罗＠（麻醉剂）、脂肪、肥皂和人造织维等工业。四月二日，意大利银行职工也举行罢工，支持他们的增加工资的要求。国立社会保险局及其各分局的职工罢工已达两周，几天前，巴马省举行了二十四小时罢工，抗议该省九家企业因报复“不合作”而关厂。
