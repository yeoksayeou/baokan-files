    Back Month—Refers to months when business transactions are generally sluggish. The exchange of many commodities exhibits seasonality based on varying social needs. For example, spring is a "back month" for the cotton industry, and summer is a "back month" for the fur industry.
    Circuit—Is the path that electric current travels. For example, a telephone circuit is where the current of speech from Party A's user is sent to the telephone; after being switched at the telephone exchange, it connects to the user Party B wishes to call. After the aforementioned current of speech is used, it returns to the telephone exchange. The path traversed by this back-and-forth current is called a circuit.
