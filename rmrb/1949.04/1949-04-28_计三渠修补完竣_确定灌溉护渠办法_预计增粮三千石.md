　　Ji San Canal Repair Completed
  　Irrigation and Canal Protection Methods Determined
  　Expected Grain Increase of 3,000 Shi
    [Our Newspaper] The Ji San Canal, one of the four major canals in the Jianping Special District of Chahar Province, with a total length of 51 *li*, was destroyed and silted up last autumn by floods. With the help of 7,000 *jin* of grain and 50,000 *yuan* in *renminbi* loaned by the Special Commissioner's Office, and 1,000,000 *yuan* in *renminbi* loaned by the Huolu County Government, work began on the 29th day of the first lunar month. As of now, more than 11,000 workdays have been used, 607.8 *fang* of stone and 490,000 *jin* of lime have been used, and 181 stone structures have been repaired. In addition, 250 *zhang* of canals have been opened (two *zhang* wide). The original plan was to mobilize 400 people to complete this project in five days, but due to the high production enthusiasm of the peasants, 800 people came instead of 400, and the five-day plan was completed in three days. After a month and a half, the entire repair plan has been completed, and water began to be released on April 11th to irrigate the wheat. It is planned to irrigate five times before the wheat harvest. With careful cultivation, the yield per *mu* can be increased by about one *shi*. It is estimated that the total increase in production will be more than 3,000 *shi*.
    Note: This canal was opened in 1943 and named in memory of Comrade Qi Jisan, the secretary of the Huolu County Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, who bravely sacrificed himself in the anti-Japanese struggle in Huolu County in 1941. Water was first released in 1947, irrigating only 20,000 *mu*. Last year, it irrigated 30,000 *mu*, and this year it is striving to complete the irrigation of 36,000 *mu*. The canal starts from the Ye River in Dongye, Pingshan, and ends at Xiaobi and Baichigan in Huolu County, with a total length of 96 *hua li*. It is divided into three major lines: south, central, and north, and two branch lines, benefiting 22 villages. (Chaoyang, Kedong)
    [Another Report] In order to complete this year's great production task and correct the past wasteful phenomena of unorganized and unplanned irrigation, the canal management committee has specifically stipulated the following irrigation methods: 1. During irrigation, each village should use flat wood to measure the size of the land in *mu*, divide the water outlets, and irrigate their own land; 2. Except with permission, flat wooden water dividers must not be abused or privately pressured, as this would affect the flow rate; 3. In order to achieve the purpose of unified water use, except with permission when releasing water, the water must flow to the end before the upstream can open; 4. In order to ensure that both upstream and downstream lands are well irrigated, after each period of irrigating a certain crop is completed, the water conservancy headquarters will close the water outlet to regulate the unirrigated land. In order to ensure that crops are irrigated on time, the acreage and crop types of each village branch canal should be registered and reported to the headquarters so that the water volume can be adjusted in time during the irrigation period, and each village should form small household groups according to the irrigated land. Finally, it is stipulated that the standing committee members of the headquarters should form an irrigation inspection team according to the trunk canal to inspect the irrigation situation and report to the headquarters in a timely manner. At the same time, in order to prevent damage to the canal, a canal protection agreement has been formulated, stipulating reward and punishment measures. Those who casually dig trunk and branch canals, dig ditches to steal water, and endanger the canal by causing breaches will be punished in coordination with the government, and those who achieve results in protecting the canal will be given certain rewards.

　　计三渠修补完竣
  　确定灌溉护渠办法
  　预计增粮三千石
    【本报讯】察哈尔省建屏专区四大渠道之一、全长五十一里的计三渠，于去年秋即被水冲毁淤塞，在专署贷粮七千斤，人民币五万元，和获鹿县府贷人民币一百万元扶助下，于阴历正月二十九日开工，直到目前止，用工一万一千多个，用石六百零七方八，用石灰四十九万斤，已修好石工一百八十一处。此外，并开渠道二百五十丈（宽二丈）。本计划动员四百人五天完成此工程，但由于农民高度的生产热情，动员四百人来了八百人，五天的计划三天就完成了。经一个半月的时间，已完成全部修补计划，并于四月十一日开始放水浇麦。麦夏前计划浇五次。再加以精耕细作，每亩约可增粮一市斗。总计可增产三千余石。
    按：该渠于一九四三年开修，为纪念四一年坚持获鹿县抗日斗争而壮烈牺牲的中共县委书记齐计三同志而得名。一九四七年开始放水，只浇二万亩，去年浇到三万亩，今年争取完成浇三万六千亩。渠道西起平山东冶之冶河，东至获鹿县之小壁、百尺杆止，全长九十六华里；共分南、中、北三大干线和二支线。受益二十二村。（朝阳、克东）
    【又讯】为完成今年大生产任务，纠正已往浇水无组织无计划的浪费现象，该渠渠道管理委员会特规定灌溉办法：一、灌溉时各村以平木按地亩计尺度分水口各自灌溉；二、平木分水口除允准外，不得滥用私压而影响流速；三、为达到统一用水目的，在放水时除允准外，必须通水到底，上游才得开口；四、为使上下游都能浇好地，每期灌溉一定作物完毕后，由水利总会封闭该水口，以调剂未浇之地。为保证作物按期灌溉，各村支渠之地亩、作物种类亩数，应进行登记报告总会，以便在灌溉期间及时调剂水量，各村按浇地组成小户小组。最后规定：总会常委按干渠编成灌溉检查组，检查灌溉情况，及时向总会报告，同时为防止破坏渠道，特制订护渠公约，规定奖惩办法，对随手挖干、支渠道，挖沟偷水，使渠发生决口危险者定协同政府予以处罚，对护渠有成绩者给予一定的奖励。　（朝阳）
