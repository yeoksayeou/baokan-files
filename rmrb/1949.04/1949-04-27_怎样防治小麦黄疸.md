How to Prevent and Control Wheat Yellow Dwarf Disease

In North China, wheat seedlings often suffer from yellow dwarf disease (also known as yellow rust) every year, which seriously affects wheat yield.

Cause of yellow dwarf disease: It is caused by the transmission of yellow dwarf bacteria. If the wheat fields where yellow dwarf occurred last year were not cleaned of weeds during plowing, this bacterium will parasitize on the weeds. When it encounters humid and hot weather, it will spread. Wheat fields that are too wet, such as irrigated land and river bend land, or low-lying areas that cannot be ventilated and exposed to the sun; or those that are planted too densely, or those that are fertilized with too much human manure or bean cake, causing the wheat leaves to grow very lush, are prone to yellow dwarf. The period from Grain Rain to the Beginning of Summer, when there is a lot of rain and sultry heat, is the period when yellow dwarf is most likely to occur.

Prevention and control methods: First, hoe more appropriately, because more hoeing can remove weeds, eliminate the parasitic and transmission routes of yellow dwarf, and at the same time loosen the soil, allowing air to circulate in the soil, enhancing the weathering of soil particles, and strengthening the supply of nutrients to the wheat. This not only makes wheat more resistant, but also increases wheat yield and flour production.

Second, wheat should be watered less after Grain Rain, because yellow dwarf bacteria cannot easily reproduce without adequate humidity. As the rural saying goes, "Water wheat little, water millet a lot". If necessary, spray more soapy water (dissolve five taels of soap in hot water, then pour it into one hundred catties of cold water, and spray it with a sprayer).

Third, check the fields diligently, and if you find wheat leaves with yellow spots, tear them off immediately, and then pull out the entire plant (yellow dwarf wheat straw is good for treating hernias when eaten by livestock, so it is best to burn it).

Fourth, use less human manure and bean cake, and more ash soil fertilizer, stove soil, and chicken and pigeon manure.

　　怎样防治小麦黄疸
    华北各地，每年的麦苗常发生黄疸病（又名黄锈病），严重影响麦子的产量。
    黄疸病原因：是由黄疸菌传染而来。去年发生了黄疸的麦地，如耕地时没将地里乱草收拾净，这种病菌就寄生在草上，遇上湿热的气候，就传布起来。在水浇地、河套地等过于潮湿或低洼不能透风见太阳的地方；或耩得太密，或施人粪、豆饼过多致麦叶长的非常肥嫩茂盛的麦田都易生黄疸。谷雨到立夏雨多闷热的时期，是黄疸最易发生的时期。
    防治的方法：第一，适当的多锄，因为多锄可除去杂草，消灭黄疸的寄生与传播的路，同时可使土壤疏松，土内空气流通，增进土粒的风化，加强了麦子养分的供给，这不但使小麦增强抵抗力，且能多收麦出面多。
    第二，在谷雨后麦宜少浇。因为黄疸菌得不到适当的湿度就不易繁殖。农村俗说“麦浇小，谷浇老”。必要时可多喷些肥皂水（肥皂五两泡化在热水里，然后倒在一百斤的冷水中，用喷壶装着喷射）。
    第三，需在地里勤查看，发现黄点麦叶赶紧把它撕去，再重就连棵拔去（黄疸麦秸被牲口吃了好得隔疝，所以最好是烧掉）。
    第四，是少施人粪尿和豆饼，多使灰土粪、炕土、鸡鸽粪。
