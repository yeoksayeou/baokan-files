　　Preventing Diphtheria

　　[Beiping News] Diphtheria has occurred among residents of Beiping. The Municipal Third Hospital has admitted diphtheria patients. Diphtheria is an acute infectious disease, and if prevention is not carried out promptly, it will cause great harm. It is hoped that people's governments at all levels will focus on vaccinating children aged one to six with diphtheria toxoid in major cities and densely populated areas along transportation routes. If the disease has already occurred, strict isolation should be implemented, and young people in nearby residential areas should be forcibly vaccinated with diphtheria toxoid to prevent its spread.

　　防御白喉
    【平市讯】北平市民中有白喉发生，市立第三医院曾收容白喉患者。按白喉为急性传染病，倘不迅速预防，危害极大。希各级人民政府在较大城市及交通要道人口稠密地区，有重点的在一岁至六岁的小儿中接种白喉类毒素。如已发生该病应严格隔离，并于附近居民青年中强制接种白喉类毒素，以杜绝流行。（坦丁）
