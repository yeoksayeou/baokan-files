　　Failure to Utilize Right-Wing Elements
    U.S. Imperialism Issues New Instructions to its Spies
  　Changes Tactics to Strengthen Activities in Eastern Europe
    [Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, 5th] Budapest Dispatch: The "New World" newspaper recently published an article on American spies organizing new underground spy networks in Eastern European countries, stating: According to well-informed sources in Washington, the failures of the American espionage agencies in Eastern European countries have forced the heads of the central organs of the American spy network to reorganize and inspect their entire work system and organization in these countries. In mid-February, the central organs of the U.S. intelligence service issued some new instructions to their spies in Eastern European countries, ordering them to temporarily stop using right-wing elements, especially those right-wing elements who have become notorious for their activities directly opposing the current regime. The various central organizations of American intelligence agencies, in accordance with their instructions, proposed to immediately conceal the activities of espionage groups in right-wing parties and church organizations, and to rearrange spies, etc., based on recent failures. These instructions ordered that when selecting intelligence personnel, special attention should be paid to those employees and officers employed by government agencies, some of whom previously served bourgeois governments and are now cooperating with the current regime, and have not yet lost their reputation. The instructions also proposed that espionage organizations operating in Eastern European countries should establish close ties with the diplomatic representatives of Western European countries. It was also proposed that spies operating in these countries should use all legal and illegal opportunities to hire new people to collect intelligence.

　　利用右翼分子技俩失败了
    美帝对其间谍发出新指示
  　变个花样加强在东欧活动
    【新华社北平五日电】布达佩斯讯：新世界报顷发表美国间谍在东欧各国组织新的地下间谍网一文称：据华盛顿消息灵通人士说，美国谍报机关在东欧各国的失败，迫使美国间谍网中央机关的头子改组和检查他们在这些国家的整个工作系统和组织。二月中旬，美国谍报处中央机关给他们在东欧各国的间谍发出了一些新指示，训令他们暂时停止利用右翼分子，特别是那些因为直接反对现政权的活动而声名狼籍的右翼分子。美国特务机关各中心组织依它们的指示，提议把在右翼党派和教会机关中的谍报小组的活动立刻隐蔽起来，并根据最近的失败经验从新布置间谍等。那些指示训令当选择谍报人员时，要特别注意那些受雇于政府机关的职员和军官，他们当中有些是过去曾为资产阶级政府服务，现在与现政权合作，迄今尚未丧失声誉的人。指示也提议在东欧各国活动的谍报组织要与西欧各国的外交代表建立密切的联系。并且提议在这些国家活动的间谍，要利用一切合法与非法的机会，雇用新人搜集谍报。
