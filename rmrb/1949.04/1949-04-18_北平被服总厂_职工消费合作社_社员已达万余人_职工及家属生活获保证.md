　　Beiping Clothing General Factory
  　Employee Consumer Cooperative
    Membership Reaches Over Ten Thousand
  　Guaranteeing the Livelihood of Employees and Their Families
    [Beiping City News] The Beiping Clothing General Factory Employee Consumer Cooperative has 10,490 employees and family members who have joined as members. Among them, 8,500 people have paid their shares, totaling 551,879 yuan in Renminbi. In the 50 days of operation, it has sold 98,547 jin of millet, 110,145 jin of macaroni, 89,090 jin of corn flour, 11,176 jin of sorghum, 7,068 jin of peanut oil, 11,431.25 jin of soy sauce, 7,570.25 jin of salt, and many other daily necessities such as towels, soap, and alkaline blocks. The workers' response to the cooperative is: 1. Sufficient supply: the cooperative supplies the entire family's food and daily necessities. 2. In the past, under the Kuomintang, the cooperative did not care about the workers' difficulties after wages were paid; now the cooperative can guarantee that food can be bought after wages are paid.
    Because it plays a guaranteeing role in the lives of employees, the employees cherish it very much. On the 10th of this month, when the 6th branch was selling goods, the female worker Ning Wenying, while buying goods, found that the cooperative had miscalculated the bill and underpaid the cooperative by 119 yuan. After she discovered it, she automatically went to the cooperative to make up the difference. When the female worker Chen Xiufeng was buying macaroni, the cooperative misread the scale and gave her ten more jin. The next day, she returned it herself. When the male worker Wang Ruihuai from the repair department was buying goods at the general factory cooperative, because the cooperative staff was careless and did not carefully look at the shopping certificate, they gave him two bars of soap. He said, "There is no soap on my shopping certificate. You made a mistake and it can't be accounted for. I don't want it," and returned the soap on the spot.
    However, the cooperative is not complacent about this. At the joint meeting of branch staff on the 14th of this month, the work group and the supply and marketing cooperative work group still seriously reviewed the shortcomings of their work: (1) Insufficient assistance to the branches. (2) Not carefully inspecting the goods during grain transportation, and sometimes merchants play tricks in the middle, which was not checked in time. (3) The cooperation between cooperative sales and wage distribution is not good. (4) Everyone is busy with business, and insufficient education for members. (5) Too little effort is made to go deep into the workers to understand the situation. Regarding future work, everyone put forward the following suggestions: 1. Go deep into the workers to understand the situation, and purchase goods that meet the needs of the workers; 2. Take the initiative to contact worker representatives and workers to study work; 3. Discuss matters with workers and humbly accept everyone's opinions; 4. Strengthen cooperative affairs, organize member groups, establish a cooperative affairs committee, and educate members; 5. Coordinate with worker representatives to carefully inspect the quality of the grain in the warehouse during grain transportation; 6. Carefully study business matters and organize employee purchasing groups; 7. Be selfless, put down airs, endure hardships and work hard, and be a long-term worker for the workers. Regarding the issue of principles, they are prepared to further develop in the direction of production cooperatives.

　　北平被服总厂
  　职工消费合作社
    社员已达万余人
  　职工及家属生活获保证
    【平市讯】北平被服总厂职工消费合作社，职工及家属已有一万零四百九十人入社当了社员，其中八千五百人已缴了股金，计人民券五十五万一千八百七十九元。经营五十天来，出售了小米九八、五四七斤，通粉一一○、一四五斤，玉米面八九、○九○斤，高粱米一一、一七六斤，花生油七、○六八斤，酱油一一、四三一·二五斤，食盐七、五七○·二五斤，及不少毛巾、肥皂、碱块等日用品。工人对合作社的反映是：一、供应充足：合作社把全家人的食粮和日用品全部供给了。二、从前国民党发工资后，合作社不管工人困难；现在合作社能保证发下工资后买到食粮。
    由于她对职工生活起了保证作用，所以职工们对她非常爱护。本月十日六分社售货时，女工宁文英在买货中，因合作社算错了帐，少给了合作社一一九元，她发觉后就自动到合作社补足。女工陈秀峰买通粉时，合作社看错了秤，给他多秤了十斤，第二日自己又交回；修理部男工王瑞槐在总厂合作社买货时，因合作社人员粗心，没有细看购物证，给了肥皂二条，他说：“我的购物证上没有肥皂，你们弄错了没法过帐，我不能要”，当面把肥皂退回。
    但是，该社并不以此自满。在本月十四日各分社职员联席会上，工作组及供销社工作组仍认真检讨了自己工作的缺点：（一）对各分社的帮助不够。（二）运粮中没有细心看货，有时商人在当中搞鬼，也没及时检查。（三）合作社售货和发工资配合不好。（四）大家都忙于业务，对社员教育不够。（五）深入工人了解情况做得太少。关于今后工作，大家提出以下意见：一、要深入工人中去了解情况，购货要适合工友的需要；二、要主动找职工代表和工友取得联系，研究工作；三、有事要和工友商量，虚心接受大家意见；四、加强社务工作，组织社员小组，成立社务委员会，教育社员；五、运粮要配合职工代表，细心到仓库看品质的好坏；六、对业务上要细心研究，组织职工代买小组；七、要大公无私，放下架子，吃苦耐劳，为工人当长工。关于方针问题，他们准备进一步向生产合作社方向发展。　　　　　　　　　　　　　（杨银江）
