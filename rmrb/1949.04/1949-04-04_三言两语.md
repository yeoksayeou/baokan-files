Brief Remarks

　　The Qingming Festival is Approaching

    Production plans must be implemented, and the task of "lengthening production by an inch" must be completed. Judging from the situation in various places, there are still phenomena of empty talk on paper and laissez-faire, and there is still a considerable distance to go to realize the plan. Moreover, farmers still have many concerns about growing various cash crops. However, with the Qingming Festival approaching and the farming season pressing, how to implement the plan is an important issue that local leaders must vigorously resolve. The Jizhong District Party Committee has issued instructions criticizing the laissez-faire attitude of some counties, districts, and villages, as well as the coercive commandism of some village cadres. It has also proposed methods such as conducting a general inspection of the implementation of production plans. Huailai County in Chahar has reviewed its production work and decided to strengthen leadership in the future to overcome laissez-faire. These measures are necessary, but it is also necessary to go deep into the masses and launch a mass inspection in conjunction with the masses. The doubts of the masses must be explained and dispelled, and the difficulties of the masses must be helped to solve, so that the inspection does not become a formality and the production plan is truly implemented!

    Helping the Families of Martyrs and Soldiers Accumulate Fertilizer

    Yushe Third District has decided to adopt various methods to ensure that the families of martyrs and soldiers have a considerable amount of fertilizer in their efforts to provide preferential treatment for military families through land tilling and helping them with production. This will ensure that the land of the families of martyrs and soldiers can also be guaranteed production in the development of the great production movement, which is worthy of emulation by various places. This can not only guarantee universal production increase, but also enable the families of martyrs and soldiers to produce happily and the soldiers to kill the enemy at the front with peace of mind!

　　三言两语
  　清明即至
    生产计划必须贯彻，“生产长一寸”的任务必须完成，就各地情形来看，仍有纸上空文，放任自流现象，实现计划还有相当距离，而农民对于多种经济作物，还有不少顾虑。但，清明即届，农时紧迫，如何贯彻计划，则是各地领导上必须大力解决的重要课题。冀中区党委已发出指示，批判了某些县、区、村的放任自流，也批判了某些村干部强迫命令的作风，又提出普遍检查执行生产计划等办法；察哈尔怀来县检讨了生产工作，决定今后要加强领导，以克服自流，这些措施都是必要的。但还须深入到群众中去，结合群众展开群众性的检查。对群众的疑虑必须解释祛除，对群众的困难必须帮助解决，使检查不致成为形式，使生产计划真正贯彻下去！
    帮助烈军属积肥
    榆社三区在优军代耕、帮助烈军属生产上，决定了采用各种方法，保证烈军属有相当数量的肥料，这在开展大生产运动中，使烈军属的土地，也能因此而保证生产，是值得各地效法的。这不仅可以保证普遍增产，并可以使烈军属愉快生产，战士在前方安心杀敌！
