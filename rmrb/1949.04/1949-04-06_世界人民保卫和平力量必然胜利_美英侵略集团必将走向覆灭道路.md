　　The World's Forces Defending Peace Will Inevitably Triumph
  　The U.S.-British Aggression Group Will Inevitably Head Towards Destruction
    The North Atlantic Aggression Pact, which threatens world peace and security, was signed in Washington on April 4th. The foreign ministers of eleven countries, including Britain, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Italy, Portugal, Denmark, Norway, and Iceland, have gathered in Washington to await the instructions of the U.S. government and sign this contract that betrays the interests of their own people and national sovereignty. These lackey diplomats, who serve the big capitalists, are discussing under the nose of the U.S. government how to absorb Franco's Spain and West Germany, as well as how to win over Sweden to participate in the North Atlantic Pact, and taking this opportunity to discuss the establishment of a West German government, ultimately completing the conspiracy to split Germany.
    On March 31st, on the eve of the formal signing of the North Atlantic Aggression Pact, the Soviet government submitted a memorandum to the governments of seven countries: the United States, Britain, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, and Canada. This memorandum, following the statement by the Soviet Foreign Ministry on January 29th of this year, further exposed and struck at the aggressive intentions of the signatory countries of the North Atlantic Pact. The Soviet government pointed out that the North Atlantic Pact includes major powers such as the United States, Britain, and France, while excluding the Soviet Union, so it is clearly used to oppose the Soviet Union and the people's democratic countries! The North Atlantic Pact is a multilateral treaty establishing a "closed-door national group," and its goal is not to prevent new German aggression, but rather to implement tense military measures through cooperation between the United States, Britain, and France. Therefore, the fundamental nature of the pact is by no means defensive; the countries included in the North Atlantic Pact are located on both hemispheres of the Earth, and the pact stipulates that signatory countries can use force without any approval from the United Nations Security Council, so it is not a regional agreement, but a tool to undermine the United Nations Charter. The Soviet government warned the U.S.-British group that the act of seizing world hegemony through the North Atlantic Pact would only repeat the mistakes of fascist Germany. After the Soviet government's memorandum was issued, the U.S. State Department spokesperson and the foreign ministers gathered in Washington could not make any powerful defense, except for unreasonable rejection.
    The movement against the North Atlantic Aggression Pact and in defense of world peace is continuing to expand. As of April 1st, organized people who have expressed support for the World Congress of Defenders of Peace and their willingness to send representatives to the congress have reached 500 million, that is, nearly a quarter of the world's population. From Algeria in North Africa to Venezuela in South America, from workers to students, the same call is being issued: we want to strive for lasting peace and oppose the instigators of new wars.
    Before the signing of the North Atlantic Pact, on April 3rd, the various democratic parties in China, led by the Chinese Communist Party, issued a joint statement on behalf of the great Chinese people, resolutely opposing the North Atlantic Pact. This historic statement, filled with the spirit and determination to safeguard world peace, solemnly declared: If the imperialist aggressive group dares to provoke a reactionary war that endangers the people of the world, then we will unite the people of the whole country, and join hands with China's ally, the Soviet Union, and the peace and democratic forces of all countries, to defeat the aggressors, overthrow and consolidate the imperialist system, and realize the liberation of all mankind and permanent peace. The Chinese delegation to the World Congress of Defenders of Peace is on its way to Paris, and it will tell the world the firm determination and victorious confidence of the Chinese people, who stand at the forefront of the peace camp, to oppose aggressive wars and strive for people's democracy and lasting peace. The Congress of Cultural and Scientific Workers for World Peace, convened by progressive intellectuals in the United States, passed a resolution before its closing, expressing its determination to fight against fascism and prevent new wars. This meeting brushed aside the war cries spread by the U.S. big capitalists' kept newspapers and radios, and issued a resounding call for the universal peace desired by the American people. This could not but startle the U.S. ruling group, which deliberately covers the eyes of the American people and plans to drive them to the slaughterhouse. Therefore, the U.S. State Department and the Department of Justice forced foreign representatives who participated in the New York Peace Congress to leave the country immediately. However, the congress has produced a Committee for Cultural and Scientific Workers for Peace, and its local committees have begun preparing to convene a series of local "Congresses of Cultural and Scientific Workers for Peace." The U.S. government will not be able to prevent the call of this peace congress from spreading to the vast residents of the United States.
    In the Soviet Union, the bastion of world peace, the 11th Congress of the Communist Youth League was solemnly opened on March 29th. During the thirteen years since the 10th Congress in 1936, the ranks of the Communist Youth League have expanded from 4 million to 9 million, and it also leads more than 10 million Young Pioneers. During this period, the Communist Youth League has played an outstanding role in leading Soviet youth to defeat German and Japanese fascism together with the people of the whole country, completing the task of socialist construction, and educating the younger generation with communism, and struggling to strengthen the unity of democratic youth in the world. The Soviet Communist Youth League is a vital force among the Soviet people, who are the mainstay in defending world peace.

### 世界人民保卫和平力量必然胜利　美英侵略集团必将走向覆灭道路

　　世界人民保卫和平力量必然胜利
  　美英侵略集团必将走向覆灭道路
    威胁世界和平与安全的北大西洋侵略公约，四月四日在华盛顿签字了。英、法、荷、比、卢、意、葡、丹、挪、冰（岛）、加十一国外长已集合在华盛顿，听候美国政府的吩咐，在这个出卖本国人民利益、国家主权的契约上签字。这些为大资本家服务的奴才外交家们，正在美国政府鼻息下，商讨如何吸收佛朗哥西班牙和西德以及拉拢瑞典来参加北大西洋公约，并且乘此时机商量建立西德政府，最后完成分裂德国的阴谋。
    在北大西洋侵略公约正式签订的前夕，三月三十一日，苏联政府向美、英、法、比、荷、卢、加七国政府提出了备忘录。这个备忘录继今年一月二十九日苏联外交部声明之后，给北大西洋公约缔约国的侵略意图，以进一步的暴露和打击。苏联政府指出：北大西洋公约包罗了美、英、法诸大国，而排斥了苏联，所以显然是用来反苏反人民民主国家的！北大西洋公约是建立“关着大门的国家集团”的多边条约，它不以防止德国的新侵略为目标，却由美、英、法合作实行紧张的军事措施，所以公约的基本性质绝不是防御的；北大西洋公约所包括的国家处于地球的两半球上，而且规定缔约国不必经过联合国安理会的任何批准即可使用武力，所以不是区域性协定，而是破坏联合国宪章的工具。苏联政府警告美英集团说：用北大西洋公约来攫取世界霸权的举动，只会重蹈法西斯德国的复辙而已。苏联政府的备忘录提出后，美国国务院发言人和在华盛顿集会的各国外长，除了无理地拒绝外，不能作任何有力的辩护。
    反对北大西洋侵略公约，保卫世界和平的运动正在继续扩大。已经表示支持世界拥护和平大会和愿意派遣代表参加大会的有组织人民，截至四月一日止，已达五万万，也就是说，约近全世界人口的四分之一。从北非的阿尔及利亚到南美的委内瑞拉，从工人到学生，都发出一样的呼声：我们要争取持久的和平，反对新战争挑拨者。
    在北大西洋公约签字前，四月三日，以中国共产党为首的中国各民主党派，代表伟大的中国人民，发表坚决反对北大西洋公约的联合声明。这个充满着维护世界和平的精神与决心的历史性声明，庄严地宣告：如果帝国主义侵略集团竟敢挑动危害全世界人民的反动战争，那么我们将团结全国人民，与中国的盟友苏联和各国和平民主势力，携手并进，打败侵略者，推翻巩固帝国主义制度，实现全人类的解放和永久的和平。中国出席世界拥护和平大会的代表团已在赴巴黎途中，它将把站在和平阵营前列的中国人民反对侵略战争、争取人民民主与持久和平的坚强决心和胜利信心，告诉全世界。美国进步知识分子召开的文化与科学界保卫世界和平大会，于闭幕之前，通过决议，表示反对法西斯主义与阻止新战争斗争的决心。这个会议排开美国大资本家御用报纸与广播所散布的战争叫嚣，发出美国人民渴望普遍和平的响亮呼声。这不能不使蓄意盖着美国人民眼睛，打算把他们驱上屠场的美国统治集团大吃一惊。因此，美国国务院和司法部逼迫参加纽约和平大会的外国代表立即离境。然而大会已产生出文化与科学界拥护和平委员会，它的各地方委员会已开始准备召开一连串的地方“文化与科学界拥护和平大会”。美国政府将无法阻止这次和平大会的呼声传播到美国广大居民中去。
    在世界和平堡垒的苏联，共产主义青年团第十一届代表大会已于三月二十九日隆重地开幕。从一九三六年第十届代表大会以来的十三年期间，共产主义青年团的队伍从四百万人扩大到九百万人，此外还领导着一千多万人的少年先锋队员，在这个期间为苏联共产党准备了四百万党员。共产主义青年团在领导苏联青年跟全国人民一起击败德日法西斯，完成社会主义建设任务方面，以及以共产主义教育年青一代，为加强世界民主青年的团结而斗争方面，都起着卓越的作用，苏联共产主义青年团是作为保卫世界和平的中坚的苏联人民中的生力军。
