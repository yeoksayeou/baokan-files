　　Beggars in Beiping

　　When the Kuomintang reactionaries ruled Beiping, the people suffered from the exploitation and extortion of imperialists, bureaucratic capital, corrupt officials, secret agents, and unscrupulous merchants. Their lifeblood was sucked dry, and many people were reduced to beggars. On the streets and in the alleys, one could see fellow countrymen in ragged clothes begging for alms. The enemy and puppet relief agencies were merely for show. Who cared about your life or death if you were truly poor!

　　Since liberation, over the past two months, through the explanations and persuasion of the People's Government, and assistance in returning refugees to their hometowns, free train tickets were issued to the poor, and the unemployed workers were registered, the number of beggars has gradually decreased a lot. But today there are still no less than four thousand beggars remaining in Beiping. Among them are poor people from professions such as rickshaw pullers, cooks, small businesses, shop assistants, small workers, tea servants, hawkers, cart drivers, and small handicraftsmen. Most of them live in the "chicken feather shops" near Gouweiba Hutong, Chuantangyuan, and Shanjiankou near Tianqiao in the Twelfth District. The Twelfth District People's Government surveyed 232 beggars in the district, including 187 men, 45 women, 128 elderly, 83 middle-aged, 21 young people and children, and 71 disabled people. About one-third of them have labor ability. Some of them are unwilling to be beggars. They plan to beg for some money to go home or find a proper job to make a living. Some have become "professional beggars" under the long-term dark rule. They have developed a dependency and are unwilling to work again, taking begging as a lifelong career and becoming parasites on society. This type of beggar accounts for the majority in Beiping now. There is a one-legged beggar on Qianmen Street who goes to large stores in Qianmen Street, Dashilar, and Xianyukou in turn to ask for money every day. He only needs to visit about ten stores a day. He enters the store without any politeness and demands ten yuan, not accepting five yuan. On the morning of April 10, a beggar named Li Zhishan came to the Zhengxin Cloth Shop outside Qianmen. He refused one yuan, and he refused five yuan, insisting on ten yuan. As a result, an argument broke out. Li Zhishan said that the shop assistant tore up his permit, and the case was taken from the Public Security Bureau police station to the sub-station. Finally, it was taken to the Twelfth Sub-bureau. As a result, the sub-bureau asked Zhengxin Cloth Shop to pay 50 yuan to settle the matter. Whether the handling of this matter by the Public Security Sub-bureau is correct is worth considering, because it does not benefit the transformation of beggars at all, but makes them feel that begging is easy and more unwilling to do proper work.

　　The Beiping Municipal People's Government has decided to further strengthen the reorganization of beggars in the city. Under the policy of developing production, beggars with labor ability will be organized, educated and transformed, and the method of using work as relief will be adopted, first participating in the sanitation campaign and giving appropriate wages. Those who are fleeing landlords and outsiders who become beggars will be assisted in returning to their hometowns and issued free train tickets. Those who cannot work will be given relief and shelter. But simple relief is not a good way. The old, weak and disabled should also be organized to do simple production. If they are missing a leg, don't they still have hands to work? Now some citizens have suggested to the Civil Affairs Bureau to establish simple craft learning centers, such as learning to knit socks, towels, paste matchboxes, tailoring, etc., to teach the old and weak beggars to produce. Although this is not a simple thing that can be done in a short time, if we work hard and use the enemy and puppet relief homes as a foundation, and work in a planned and step-by-step manner, beggars can naturally be reduced from many to few, and from few to none. In the old liberated areas, can't we already see no beggars?

### 北平的乞丐

　　北平的乞丐
    国民党反动派统治北平的时候，老百姓受着帝国主义者、官僚资本、贪官、特务、奸商等多方面剥削与敲诈，脂膏血汗被吮吸殆尽，很多人沦为乞丐。大街上，胡同里，到处可以看到衣服褴褛伸手乞讨的同胞。敌伪的救济机关，只是装饰门面。对真正贫苦的人，谁管你死活！
    解放后，两个月来，经过人民政府的解释，劝说，协助难民还乡，发给贫民免费乘车证，举行失业工人登记，乞丐虽逐渐的减少了很多，但今天留在北平的仍不下四千人。其中包括车夫、厨行、小生意、店伙、小工、茶役、小贩、赶车、小手艺等业的穷人，杂居在第十二区天桥附近沟尾巴胡同、川堂院、山涧口一带“鸡毛小店”的为最多。十二区人民政府调查了区内的二百三十二个乞丐，其中男一八七人，女四五人，老年一二八人，壮年八三人，青年儿童二一人，残废七一人，有劳动力者约占三分之一。这中间有一些是不甘心作乞丐的，他们准备讨一些钱回家去，或找正当职业来谋生。有些则在长期黑暗统治下已经成了“职业性乞丐”，养成了依赖性，不愿意再做活，拿乞讨做终生职业，变成了社会的寄生虫。现在北平的这种乞丐占大多数。前门大街有一个一条腿的乞丐，天天只到前门大街和大栅栏、鲜鱼口的一些大商店轮流要钱。一天只要十家左右，进店门毫不客气，要十块钱不能给五块。四月十日上午，前外正信布庄来了一个叫李志山的乞丐，给一块钱不要，给五块钱也不要，非要十块不可，结果口角起来。李志山说店伙撕了他的路条，由公安局派出所闹到分驻所。最后又闹到十二分局。结果分局叫正信布庄拿出五十元了事。公安分局对这件事的处理是否正确，是值得考虑的。因为这对乞丐的改造没有一点好处，反而使他们觉得行乞容易，更不愿干正当职业了。
    北平人民市政府已经决定对平市的乞丐再加强整理。在发展生产的方针下，组织有劳动力的乞丐，加以教育改造，用以工代赈的方法，先参加清洁卫生运动，给予适当的工资。逃亡地主和外乡人流为乞丐者，协助其还乡，发给免费乘车证，不能劳动生产者予以救济收容。但单纯的救济，并不是一个好办法。对老弱残废，也应该组织起来，作简单的生产，缺了腿，不是还有手能工作吗？现在已经有市民向民政局建议成立简单的工艺学习所，如学习织袜子、手巾、糊火柴盒、裁缝之类，教老弱乞丐生产；这虽然不是简单的一时就能办好的事，但我们认真的去作，用接收敌伪的救济院作为基础，有计划有步骤的去作，乞丐自可以由多而少，由少而无。在老解放区里不是已经看不到乞丐了吗？
