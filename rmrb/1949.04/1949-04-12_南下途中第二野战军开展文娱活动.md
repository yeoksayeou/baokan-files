  　Carries Out Cultural and Recreational Activities
    [Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains Front, 11th] Morale is high among the commanders and fighters of a certain unit of the Second Field Army as they march south. They have created various lively, fresh, and educationally significant cultural and recreational activities. One of the most popular is the "Marching Plaza Drama." This plaza drama was first started by the First Battalion of the Seventh Regiment. The battalion has successively performed plays such as "Supreme Glory," which depicts joining the Party during the march, "Xia Weizhao's Transformation," which depicts the transformation of backward elements and criticizes retreating thoughts, and "Road to Light," which have had a great impact on encouraging and educating the troops. In addition, activities such as "Glory Flower," "Glory Lamp," and "Inserting the Red Flag" are also prevalent in the unit. Every day when encamping, flowers are given, red flags are inserted, or lamps are hung for model individuals and units during the march.

  　第二野战军
  　开展文娱活动
    【新华社中原前线十一日电】第二野战军某部南下途中，情绪高涨的指战员们创造了各种新鲜活泼和富有教育意义的文化娱乐活动。其中最受欢迎的一种是“行军广场剧”。这种广场剧首先是由七团的第一营开始的。该营曾先后演出了描写行军中入党的“无上光荣”，描写落后分子转变和批评退缩思想的“夏伟召转变”，“光明路”等剧，对部队的鼓舞和教育作用很大。此外，该部还普遍流行着“光荣花”、“光荣灯”、“插红旗”等活动。每天宿营时，即给行军中的模范人物和单位戴花，插红旗，或挂灯。
