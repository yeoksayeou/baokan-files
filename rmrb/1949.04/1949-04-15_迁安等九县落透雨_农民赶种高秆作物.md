[Jidong Dispatch] Following a soaking rain on April 1st in Qian'an and nine other counties within the Jidong Twelfth Special District, farmers are seizing the opportune moment to form small mutual aid teams based on the principle of voluntary exchange and are commencing the sowing of tall-stalk crops. Rural women across the region are actively participating in spring plowing and production. Incomplete statistics from Luan County show that approximately 1,939 women throughout the county are engaged in heavy tasks such as assisting with plowing, spring land turning, manure collection, and manure pounding, accounting for 18% of the county's able-bodied women. In Qian'an County, over 200 villages have sown more than 80,000 mu of large fields in the past ten days. In Luan County's First District, Yangwazi, Shuangmiaozi, and ten other villages have planted 636 mu of millet, 36 mu of beans, and 43 mu of spring wheat, and have prepared 175 mu of sweet potato land in the seven days from March 31st to April 6th. After the Funing County Bank issued 400,000 yuan in Renminbi as special crop loans, farmers in various villages are actively preparing to plant more sweet potatoes. In Lulong Second District, Nanshangou Village, 55 impoverished military households, after receiving bank loans, expect to grow 600,000 sweet potato seedlings, enough to plant 180 mu of sweet potatoes.
