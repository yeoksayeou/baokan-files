    Characteristics and Advantages of Sz Cotton
    Sz Cotton is a new variety of American cotton belonging to the large-boll, early-maturing type. Its advantages are: high yield, long fiber, high lint yield, and relatively early maturity. It has a moderate height and robust plant. Its branches and leaves extend outwards, with three to five vegetative branches (water shoots), short internodes, and long fruiting branches, giving the whole plant a pyramidal shape. The bolls are large and round, with four to five segments, and are resistant to wind and rain.

    In detail, Sz cotton can be further divided into many lines. The two lines being promoted for planting in North China this year are Sz Cotton No. 4 and Sz Cotton No. 1. They are introduced separately as follows:

    1. Sz Cotton No. 4: Early maturing, high yielding, relatively drought-resistant, and strong resistance to wind and rain. Its plant has a short, bushy pyramidal shape, about two chi high, with short internodes on the main stem and branches, making it noticeably compact. It has few vegetative branches and many fruiting branches. The bolls are large and round, with four or five segments. Sixty-five to seventy-five bolls can produce one jin of seed cotton. The average yield per mu can reach over two hundred jin of seed cotton. The fiber length is one inch to one and one-sixteenth inches. One hundred jin of seed cotton can yield thirty-three to thirty-five jin of lint.

    2. Sz Cotton No. 2: Matures slightly later than Sz Cotton No. 4. The plant is slightly taller, about two chi to three chi three cun. The branches and leaves are sparse, with deep green leaves. It is high yielding and resistant to wind and rain. The seeds have thick and pure white fuzz (No. 4 cotton seeds are slightly grayish-white; the two are similar in size). The bolls are slightly smaller and pointed, with five segments. Seventy to eighty bolls can produce one jin of seed cotton. The fiber of Sz Cotton No. 2 is slightly longer than that of No. 4, measuring one and one-sixteenth to one and one-eighth inches. The fiber length is very uniform, allowing it to be spun into higher counts of yarn, so spinning mills are willing to pay a higher price to purchase it. It has a high lint yield, with one hundred jin of seed cotton yielding thirty-five to thirty-six jin of lint, sometimes as high as thirty-seven jin. Because it matures slightly later, planting it in areas south of Beijing and Tianjin is safer.

    Key Points to Note When Cultivating Sz Cotton

    1. Land Preparation: The land preparation work for cotton fields should not be done carelessly and must be carefully cultivated. Winter plowing is essential, with a plowing depth of five to six cun. After plowing, the land should be finely harrowed. After thawing in the spring, spring plowing should be carried out again, or the winter-plowed land should be finely harrowed again. The finer the harrowing, the better the soil moisture can be retained.

    2. Fertilization: Sz cotton has robust plants and produces a large number of bolls, so a lot of fertilizer is necessary. Generally, 1,500 jin of farmyard manure and 50 jin of cottonseed cake or 30 jin of soybean cake should be applied per mu. Alternatively, only farmyard manure can be used, generally requiring more than 2,000 jin. The amount can be increased for lean land and decreased for fertile land. The fertilizer should be spread on the ground one week before sowing and then plowed into the soil. For applying fertilizer field powder (ammonium sulfate, ammonium nitrate), it is best to use it as topdressing (grabbing green), open a ditch four or five cun away from the seedlings, sprinkle it down, and cover it with soil. Apply ten to twenty jin per mu.

    3. Sowing Time: The sowing time for Sz cotton should not be too late, as too late sowing will increase frost-damaged cotton and reduce the amount of high-quality white cotton. However, it should not be too early either. The most suitable time is around Grain Rain.

    4. Seed Soaking and Germination: Sz cotton germinates slowly. Before sowing, the seeds should be soaked in warm water. The method is to pour boiling water over the seeds and immediately stir quickly with a wooden stick for about two or three minutes, then add cold water and stir. Soak for a day and night. For irrigated land, after soaking the seeds, take them out and cover them with burlap sacks or cloth to promote germination. Sow them quickly when the tips of the sprouts are slightly exposed. The sprout tips should not be too long to avoid damaging the sprouts during suppression and soil covering.

    Dryland Sowing: When there is a lot of moisture, the germination method can also be used; when there is little moisture, never use it, otherwise, there is a danger of drying out. You can only soak the seeds in warm water or cold water for a day and night, then take them out and mix them with plant ash, and then sow them.

    5. Punctual Sowing Method in Case of Severe Drought: Sz cotton sowing cannot be too late. In case of severe drought during the sowing period, do not wait for rain. You can determine the ridge width and plant spacing, dig holes, water, and sow. Although it is more labor-intensive, the increased yield can make up for it.

    When sowing and watering punctually, one kerosene barrel of water can water eight holes, and one hundred and twenty buckets of water per mu is enough.

    6. Ridge Width and Plant Spacing: Sz cotton plants are large, so the ridges should be widened, and the plants should be spaced further apart. According to the results of experiments in Beiping and Shijiazhuang, the highest yield is obtained when planting Sz cotton with a ridge width of two chi and a plant spacing of one chi two cun. However, the plant spacing on lean land can be closer.

    7. Thinning Seedlings: Many farmers thin their cotton seedlings only once, which has many shortcomings, such as missing seedlings or crowding. If thinning is done twice, the first time when the seedlings are two or three cun high, the dense areas should be thinned out. The second time, when the seedlings are four or five cun high, the plants should be fixed. Doing this can not only select strong cotton seedlings to leave behind, but also reduce the risk of missing seedlings.

    8. Intertillage and Weeding: Farmers know that the more diligently cotton fields are hoed, the better. When the cotton seedlings have grown three small leaves, weeding can be done. After that, intertillage and weeding must be done once every ten days or after rain, preferably five or six times. The first two hoeings should be deep, and then gradually shallower.

    There is now a tool for intertillage and weeding called the "five-tooth cultivator". One person and one animal can hoe twenty mu of land per day, hoeing quickly and well, and also saving labor. Its use is also very convenient, and it can be bought in Beiping.

    9. Topping and Removing Lower Leaves: Generally, farmers believe that cotton must be topped, but in fact, early-maturing American cotton does not need to be topped. According to the results of experiments in various places, sometimes topping can slightly increase yield, but compared with the labor used, it is really not worth it; and sometimes early-maturing cotton varieties actually reduce yield because of topping. Sz Cotton No. 4 can be grown without topping. Sz Cotton No. 2 can be topped once when it grows too vigorously, but it should not be topped too severely. The time is suitable from the Great Heat to around the Beginning of Autumn.

    The work of removing the lower leaves is really undesirable. Not only are the lower fruiting branches injured, but sometimes the bolls on the upper fruiting branches are also knocked off. It is both labor-intensive and harmful. Remember that Sz cotton should never have its lower leaves removed.

    10. Picking Cotton: Pay attention to the following when picking cotton: First, it must be dry; second, it must be clean; and third, it must be ripe. Sz cotton can be picked once every ten days or half a month. Frost-damaged cotton and white cotton should not be placed together, let alone mixed with ordinary cotton varieties. Because Sz cotton can be sold at a higher price, and the cotton seeds are also more valuable than ordinary cotton. More importantly, the pure material is maintained, so not only will you harvest good cotton next year, but it can also be promoted in other regions. After picking the cotton, it should be dried in the sun and then stored.

    11. Seed Selection: The reason why good cotton gets worse year by year and the yield gradually decreases is because of the lack of attention to seed retention. When the cotton is about to bloom, go to the field to select: (1) cotton plants of moderate height, (2) lower branches and trunk are thick and long, internodes are short, (3) cotton bolls are large and numerous, (4) early flowering, and (5) cotton plants with no diseases and pests. Tie a cloth strip or hemp rope on the top as a sign, and pick them first when picking cotton, and gin them separately. Using cotton selected in this way as seeds will definitely get better year by year.

    12. Prevention and Control of Aphids: Sz cotton is prone to aphids and must be carefully prevented and controlled in June and July. (Prevention and control methods will be introduced in another article)

    The results of the experiment in Hebei Province in the 25th year of the Republic of China are listed in the following table:

　　斯字棉的栽培法
    华北棉产改进处
  　斯字棉的性状及优点
    斯字棉是大铃早熟类美棉的新品种。它的优点是：产量高，纤维长，出穰多，成热期较早。高度适中，株体健壮。它的枝叶向四外发展，有叶枝（水杈子）三枝到五枝，节间短，果枝长，全株呈塔形。桃大圆形，四到五个瓣，有抗风雨力。
    斯字棉详细的分，还要分许多系别，本年在华北推广种植的，有斯字四号棉和斯字一号棉两系。现在分别介绍如下：
    １、斯字四号棉：成熟早，产量多，比较能耐旱，抗风雨力强。它的株体塔形矮而生长繁茂，高二尺上下，主杆及枝的节间均短，所以显着紧凑，叶枝少，果枝多，桃大圆形，四或五个瓣，六十五个至七十五个桃可摘籽棉一斤，每亩平均能产籽棉二百斤以上，绒长一英寸至一又十六分之一英寸，一百斤籽棉能轧出穰花三十三斤至三十五斤。
    ２、斯字二号棉：成熟期比较斯字四号棉稍晚，株体稍高，约二尺至三尺三寸，枝叶疏散，叶色深绿，产量多，有抗风雨力，种籽绒厚而纯白色（四号棉籽略呈灰白色，二者大小相似），桃稍小而尖，有五瓣，七十个至八十个桃可摘籽棉一斤；四斯绒比字号棉稍长，为一又十六分之一至一又八分之一英寸，绒的长度很整齐，能够纺较多支数的纱，所以纱厂愿出高价购买。出穰多，一百斤籽棉能轧出三十五斤至三十六斤穰花，有时高至三十七斤。因为它的熟期稍晚，在平津以南地区种植较为安全。
    栽培斯字棉应注意的要点
    １、整地：棉田整地工作不可草率，必须精耕细作；一定要行冬耕，耕的深度在五六寸即可，耕后细细耙平；春季化冻以后再行春耕，或将冬耕的地细耙一遍，越耙的细，越可以保持土中的水分。
    ２、施肥：斯字棉的植株粗壮，桃大量产多，所以必需多用肥料。普遍一亩地下土粪一千五百斤，棉籽饼五十斤或豆饼三十斤。或者都施用土粪，大致需二千斤以上。瘦地可照此数增加，肥地可照此数减少。施肥时期，在下种前一星期撒在地面，然后犁入土中。施用肥田粉（硫酸铔，硝酸铔），最好是做追肥用（抓青），离苗四五寸开沟撒下，盖上土就可以，每亩地施用十斤到二十斤。
    ３、播种时期：斯字棉下种时期不可太迟，太迟了霜花就要加多，好白花减少，但也不要太提早，最适宜的时期是谷雨前后。
    ４、浸种催芽：斯字棉发芽慢，播种前要用温水种，是用开水将种籽浸入，随即用木棒赶快搅动约二三分钟，再加入冷水搅和，浸泡一昼夜；水浇地于浸种后将棉籽捞出，再盖上麻袋或布片，实行催芽，俟微露芽尖时就赶快播种。芽尖不可太长，以免镇压覆土时有伤芽的危险。
    旱地播种：中水分多的时候，也可以用催芽的方法；水分少的时候，千万不要用，否则就有干死的危险，只能用温水或冷水浸种一昼夜，捞出后用草木灰拌种，然后播下即妥。
    ５、苦旱时的点播办法：斯字棉播种不能太晚，遇播种期苦旱的时候，千万不要等雨。可以定出垄宽和株间距离，挖穴浇水播种，虽然多费工，收量增多也能补得上。
    点播浇水时，一煤油桶的水可浇八穴，一亩地有一百二十挑水就够用啦。
    ６、垄宽和株间距离：斯字棉的棵大，所以垄要加宽，留苗也要远一点。在北平和石家庄试验的结果，种斯字棉以垄宽二尺苗的距离一尺二寸的，产量最高。但是瘦地留苗的距离还可以近一点。
    ７、间苗：有许多农民种棉花，只间一次苗，缺点很多，不是缺苗就是拥挤。如果行两次间苗，第一次在苗高二三寸时，把苗密的地方拔稀，第二次在苗高四五寸时再定棵，这样去做，不但可以选强壮的棉苗留下，还可以减少缺苗的危险。
    ８、中耕除草：农民们都知道种棉花锄地越勤越好。棉苗生了三个小叶的时候，就可除草，以后每隔十天或雨后，即须中耕除草一次，最好能中耕除草五六次。前两次锄的要深，以后渐浅。
    现在有一种中耕除草的用具，叫作“五齿中耕器”，一人一畜每天可锄地二十亩，锄的又好又快，还节省劳力，它的使用法也很方便，北平就可买到。
    ９、打尖及掳土叶：一般农民都认为种棉花必须打尖，其实种早熟种的美棉是不用打尖的。据各地试验的结果，有时打尖能稍增产量，但是和用去的劳力比一比，实在是不合算；并且有时早热种的棉花因为打尖，反而使产量减少。种斯字四号棉可不用打尖，斯字二号棉生长太旺盛的时候可以打一次尖，但不可掏的太重，时间以大暑到立秋的前后为适宜。
    打土叶（掳土库）的工作实在要不得，不但下部的果枝受伤，有时上部果枝的桃也被顶掉，既费劳力又有害处。种斯字棉千万记着更不能打土叶。
    １０、收花：收采棉花须注意：第一要干，第二要洁，第三要熟。斯字棉可以隔十天或半月摘花一次。霜花和白花不可放在一处，更不要与普通种棉花混杂。因为斯字棉可卖到较高的价钱，棉种也比一般棉花值钱。更重要的是保持了纯料，不仅自己明年还会收好棉花，且可其他地区推广。摘花后要向晒干再贮藏起来。
    １１、选种：好棉花一年比一年变坏收量也渐渐减少的原因，是因为不注意留种的原故。在棉花将吐絮的时候，到地里选择：（一）棉棵高矮适中，（二）下枝干部粗长，节间短，（三）棉桃又大又多，（四）开絮早，（五）无病害及虫害的棉株。于稍上结一布条或麻绳作记号，摘花时先摘下来另外轧花。用这样选出的棉花作种籽，一定能一年好似一年。
    １２、防治蚜虫：斯字棉容易生蚜虫，于六七月间必须注意防治。（防治办法将来另文介绍）
