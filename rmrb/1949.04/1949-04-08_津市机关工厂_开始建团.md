Tianjin Municipal Government Factories
　　Begin Establishing Communist Youth League
    [Tianjin Dispatch] After the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party issued a decision on establishing the New Democratic Youth League in the latter part of last month, government offices, schools, factories, and other institutions in the city have begun to carry out key work in establishing the League, or have already started preparations. Under the leadership of the district committees, the First and Seventh Districts have successively established League branches. Under the leadership of the CCP branch, the Tianjin Daily has established a preparatory committee for the establishment of the League, and is conducting registration and investigation of the dozens of League members and members of the Democratic Youth League already within the newspaper office, planning to first carry out the work of transferring League members. The "Democratic Youth League" of Nankai University has been publicly organized and collectively transferred to the League. The No. 2 Textile Factory has begun to prepare for the establishment of the League. More than 70 active and enthusiastic young workers in the factory have asked comrades from the working group to explain the organization, nature, tasks, and steps for establishing the League, and discussed the conditions for joining the League.
