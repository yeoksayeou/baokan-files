At the Transportation Conference of the Pingjin Railway Administration
　Director Guo Hongtao's concluding remarks
    Emphasizing strengthening military transport and the responsibility system
　　[This newspaper reports] The Pingjin Railway Administration recently held a railway transportation conference. Director Guo Hongtao made a concluding speech at the conference, the original text of which is as follows:

　　The Administration was formally established on February 22nd and actually began work on February 24th or 25th. At the time of its establishment, a transportation conference was held. Because the takeover of the lines occurred at different times, and everything was not yet unified, that transportation conference solved the problems of unified dispatch and unified transportation plans. At the same time, it was decided to complete a freight volume of one million tons in March, and to operate 24 pairs of passenger trains on all lines, thereby reducing passenger congestion. As a result of the efforts in March, 1,089,000 tons of freight were completed, exceeding the planned target. The number of passengers transported averaged 76,000 per day, and recently the number of passengers has increased to more than 80,000 per day. It is now planned to add two pairs of direct passenger trains between Pingjin and Shenyang starting from May 1st. The Ping-Sui line also feels that tickets are insufficient and need to be increased, but there are not enough passenger cars and need to step up the repair of passenger cars.

　　The only particularly important task in April is military transport, which is also the most glorious task of our railway. Our railway, as the starting point for transport, has a particularly heavy responsibility. It can be said that there has never been such a large-scale military transport in history. Although a large number of vehicles are heading south, the passenger and freight transport itself still needs to be increased. There were more than 4,000 freight cars in March, but only more than 3,000 this month. Therefore, it is necessary to shorten the turnaround rate of vehicles to make up for the shortage of vehicles. We have reduced it from 5.2 in February to 3.5 in March. The turnaround rate for April is set at 2.2, and now it is 2.7. We who handle transportation need to work especially hard on how to improve transportation efficiency and how to shorten the turnaround rate. The travel speed in March was 14.3 kilometers, and in the future we should try to reach 21 to 22 kilometers.

　　The opinions put forward by everyone this time are very good. After sorting them out, they will be published in the bulletin. I am not going to explain these issues, but plan to talk about the following issues:

　　(1) Transportation Issues: Why do we run railways? It is for transportation. Transportation is the concentrated expression of all railway work. Therefore, the transportation department is the most important department in the overall situation. The quality of railway management can be seen from the transportation efficiency. The peace delegation to the Paris conference arrived earlier than scheduled. They were very satisfied and sent a letter of thanks. We should satisfy all sectors of society. Therefore, we should understand the importance of our responsibilities and work together.

　　Transportation should be differentiated according to importance and urgency. At present, military transport should be the first priority. To liberate Nanjing, Shanghai, and Wuhan, and to liberate all of China, a large army needs to go south. The dispatching office must pay special attention to such a large amount of military transport. The railway is not only a business organization, but also a component of the military. The transportation of engineering materials is ranked second for road construction and support. To meet the needs of urban people, food and coal are ranked third. Finally, there is general passenger and freight transport.

　　The railway takes safety, accuracy, speed, and economy as the four major principles. We hope to strive for speed on the basis of safety, oppose conservatism, and improve driving speed as much as possible. The express train between Pingjin must be at least two and a half hours after the change of schedule this time.

　　(2) Dispatcher Responsibility System: The responsibility system is, in a sense, a revolution in the railway system. Dispatchers should be designated to be responsible for route dispatching, and strive for passenger train punctuality and freight train earliness. Commendations should be recorded for what is done well, and demerits should be recorded for what is not done well. All work must be registered. Record it every day, and summarize it every month as the standard for attendance. The dispatcher bears full responsibility for the good or bad operation of the train. The main purpose is to improve travel speed. Railways have two types of speeds: technical speed and travel speed. Technical speed is the average running speed of a train within the operating section without calculating the intermediate station stop time. Travel speed is the average running speed of a train within the operating section, calculating the intermediate station stop time. The general travel speed is 65% of the technical speed. The best lines in the Soviet Union can reach 85%. Only the Soviet Union can do it, which is currently impossible in China. Dispatchers should strive to improve technical speed and travel speed. The time for loading coal, water, and station operations should be regulated. The train dispatcher should make the train load coal quickly, get water quickly, and leave quickly to increase travel speed. The car allocation dispatcher should pay attention to quick car allocation, quick loading, quick coupling, quick shunting, and quick unloading to shorten the freight car turnaround rate. Stations that unload at night should have lighting equipment, and stations with insufficient lines can add sidings. In the future, we will check at any time whether the dispatcher has fulfilled his due responsibilities, and use the amount of punctuality and lateness and the speed of loading and unloading as the criteria for assessing the dispatcher.

　　(3) Section and Station Responsibility System: Each section and station master must be responsible for the business under their jurisdiction. The success or failure of a section or station is first of all the full responsibility of the section and station master. It is necessary to exert the operational efficiency and operation efficiency of the station, and those who handle freight must be fast in requesting cars, fast in loading, and fast in unloading. Those who handle operations must strive for passenger train punctuality and freight train earliness, and ensure that no accidents occur. Signals must not fail. Station appearance should pay attention to cleanliness and hygiene, the station should be orderly, boarding and alighting and buying tickets should be orderly, and passengers should enter and exit the station in an orderly manner. Waiting rooms with loudspeakers should broadcast relevant matters to passengers at any time. The public security section and the station master must be responsible.

　　In terms of station equipment, the station master should put forward opinions. For those stations with incomplete signals, station houses, window glass, and fences, each station should submit a budget for repairs, which will be repaired after being approved by the bureau.

　　Sorting out personnel is extremely important. There are currently too many people and adjustments are needed. Employees should raise more opinions, and the entire station should hold a meeting to discuss. Section and station masters whose ability to handle affairs is insufficient or who are incompetent, or who have other situations, can be transferred. If there are buried employees, they can be promoted. The first batch of 500 progressive young employees will be selected from the North China Staff and Cadre School, and the second batch will prepare to go to 500 people. North China University also promised to accept 200 people. During the study period, the individual will be treated according to the supply system, and the family will still be given 60% to 80% of the individual's salary.

　　(4) Train Crew Responsibility System: The locomotive has implemented a contracted crew system, and the train should also implement a system in which each train has a train captain, car captain, ticket inspector, car inspector, car attendant, etc., divided into two shifts to take turns, and each shift competes with each other, which can promote the progress of work. The cleanliness and order on the train must be improved, express trains can buy tickets with assigned seats, broadcasts can be installed, and train crews can do some publicity work to passengers.

　　(5) Military Transport Issues: Military transport is handled by the Transportation Command. After the large army goes south, the Railway Bureau can set up a military transport section. The new military transport regulations have been promulgated by the Military Commission. There may be some difficulties when it starts to be implemented, which should be overcome. As for the military transport regulations, if there are still opinions on individual clauses, the Transportation Command will submit them to the Military Commission for research. Railway employees should be kind to the military, ask for more explanations, and strictly prohibit showing attitudes to the military. However, the regulations must still be adhered to. In the event of a dispute, the public security section should assist in handling it.

　　(6) Learning Issues: The bureau stipulates that everyone must study for one and a half hours a day, from the director to all employees. The main content of the study is politics, and necessary business learning is carried out at the same time. The plan is formulated by the Learning Committee and led by the Learning Committee. Section and station masters should become learning models. At the same time, we must strive to learn the rules and regulations, because the rules and regulations are a summary of experience. Internal operating rules can be formulated by each station and submitted to the bureau for approval.

　　(7) Establish Various Necessary Systems:

　　(1) Reward and Punishment System—Good things must be rewarded, and bad things must be punished. Taking rewards as the main thing can improve everyone's service enthusiasm. Rewards take the form of bonuses and newspaper praise. Tianjin has rewarded more than 80 people. Those employees who have made meritorious contributions to protecting the factory, actively counting, and working hard in production should be commended and rewarded. We must create model station masters and model dispatchers. To promote the overall work with models and typical examples. The "Iron Bull" locomotive in the Northeast has safely traveled 106,000 kilometers without a Class A inspection and has become a national model. We should all learn from him. Rewarding the good and criticizing the bad should become the railway's reward and punishment system.

　　(2) Establish a Request and Report System—Each unit must have a work plan, have a work summary every month, and report major events.

　　(3) Establish a Work Inspection System—The person in charge of each department should inspect their subordinates and cannot just sit in the office and circle around. The station master should inspect the station equipment and work with relevant personnel when going to work every day, and the same should be done when exchanging shifts. The car section chief should regularly inspect each station, and report the results of each inspection to the bureau.

　　(4) Establish a Morning Meeting System—Mainly to convey orders and report special matters. There is no need to call the roll every day, and the speech should not be too long. All departments should advocate the habit of arriving early and leaving late from work. Oppose the phenomenon of being late and leaving early.

　　(8) Change Labor Attitudes and Styles: The railway is now owned by the people, and labor attitudes and styles must be changed. Everyone must take the attitude of being the master and serve the people's railway. First of all, we must promote a democratic style. The bureau decided to hold a meeting of employee representatives every half month to absorb the opinions of workers. Employee representatives should participate in all section and station meetings and even bureau affairs meetings. Each section should quickly establish an employee representative meeting and a production management committee to absorb workers to participate in railway management. Second, we must closely contact the masses and rely on the masses; without the masses, nothing can be accomplished. Third, we must advocate a honest and simple style, be realistic, not tell lies, not make false reports, and not flatter. Fourth, we must advocate a hands-on style, oppose bureaucratic leadership, and oppose the work style of only talking but not doing clericalism and paperwork.

　　In addition, it is proposed to implement a fixed same-shift system. From the dispatching office to the section and station, the same-shift responsibility system is implemented. This can not only compete with each other, but also easily familiarize with the situation, which is convenient for work.

　　The opinions put forward by everyone, especially the opinions of employee representatives on improving the station, are very practical, which is very good. The Railway Bureau should listen to everyone's good opinions. As for various difficult problems, the Railway Bureau should also try its best to solve them, and hope that each section and station should also strive to solve them by themselves, and should embrace the idea and style of building a family and establishing a career, and strive to overcome difficulties. After everyone goes back, convene a general meeting of all employees to discuss and study together, thoroughly implement the responsibility system, and strive to complete the important tasks entrusted to us by the country.

　　平津铁路管理局运输会议上
  　郭洪涛局长总结发言
    强调加强军运与负责制度
    【本报讯】平津铁路管理局日前召开铁路运输会议，郭洪涛局长在大会上作总结发言，原文如下：
    管理局在二月二十二日正武成立，实际开始工作是在二月二十四、五日，在成立的时候，曾经召开过一次运输会议，因为沿线接管有先后，一切尚未统一，那次运输会议解决了调度统一运输计划统一问题，同时决定三月份完成一百万吨货运的计划，在各线开行二十四对客车，因此减少了旅客拥挤的现象，三月份努力的结果，完成货运一百零八万九千余吨，超过了预定的计划，客运乘车人数每日平均七万六千人，最近旅客人数已增至每日八万人以上。现在计划自五月一日起加开平沈直通客车两对，平绥线方面也觉票车不足，需要增加，但客车不够，需要加紧修理客车。
    四月份唯一特别重要的任务，就是军运，这个任务也就是本路最光荣的任务。本路为起运路，责任特别繁重，也可以说在历史从来没有过这样大批的军运。虽然车辆大批南下，但本身的客货运输仍要增加，货车三月份有四千多辆，本月只有三千多辆，所以要缩短车辆周转率，来补救车辆的不足，我们已由二月份的五·二减少到三月份的三·五，四月份周转率定为二·二现在是二·七。我们办运输的人需要特别努力，如何把运输效率提高，如何缩短周转率。三月份的旅行速度有一四·三公里，将来应该设法达到二一至二二公里。
    大家此次提出的意见很好，把它整理起来，公报上发表，我不准备解释这些问题，就打算谈下面的几个问题：
    （１）运输问题：为什么要办铁路，就是为了运输，运输是铁路一切工作的集中表现。所以运输部门，在全局各处中，是最重要的一个部门。从运输效能，可以看出铁路办的好坏。此次和平代表团到巴黎开会，比预定时间早到，他们非常满意，曾来信致谢。我们对于社会各界都应当使他们满意。所以我们应该了解我们责任的重大，要大家一致努力。
    运输应分别轻重缓急，在目前应该是军运第一，要解放南京上海武汉，解放全中国，需要大军南下，调度所对于如此大量军运，必须特别注意。铁路不仅是一个企业机构，并且是军事中的一个组成部份。为了修路支前，工程材料运输列为第二。为了供给都市人民的需要，食粮煤炭列为第三。最后是一般的客货运输。
    铁路以安全准确迅速经济为四大原则，我们希望在安全的基础上尽力求迅速，反对保守主义，尽可能提高行车速度。平津间特快车，此次改点至少要做到二小时半。
    （２）调度负责制：负责制在某种意义上说是铁路制度上的革命，调度应指定路线负责调度，要争取客车正点，货车早点。办到的应记功，办不好的要记过，一切工作全要登记。天天记起来，每月一总结，作为考勤的标准。调度员负列车运行好坏的完全责任，主要目的在提高旅行速度。铁路有技术速度及旅行速度二种，技术速度是列车在运转区间内不计算中间站站点时分的平均运行速度，旅行速度，是列车在运转区间内计算中间站站点时分的平均运行速度，一般的旅行速度为技术速度的百分之六十五，苏联最好的线路能达到百分之八十五，只有苏联能办得到，在中国目前是不可能的。调度员要努力提高技术速度和旅行速度。上煤上水以及车站作业时间都应当有规定，行车调度员要使列车快上煤、快上水、快走，来提高旅行速度。配车调度员应注意快配车、快装车、快挂车、快甩车、快卸车，来缩短货车周转率。夜间卸车的车站要有照明设备，线路不够用的站可以加铺侧线。将来要随时检查调度员是否尽了应尽的责任，以正点误点的多少与装车卸车的快慢为考核调度员的标准。
    （３）段站负责制：各段站长对于所管业务必须负责。一段一站成绩的好坏，首先责成段站长负完全责任，要发挥车站的营业效能与运转效能，办货运的要快要车，快装、快卸。办运转的要争取客车正点，货车早点，保证不出事故。号志要不使失效。站容整理要注意清洁卫生，车站要有秩序，上下车买票要有秩序，站上要使旅客鱼贯出入，候车室内设有扩音器者，应随时给旅客广播有关的事情。公安段及站长一定要负责。
    车站设备方面，站长要提出意见，凡号志站屋窗户玻璃栅栏有不完整者，由各站提出补修预算，呈局核准后补修。
    整理人事极关重要，现在人员太多，需要调整，职工要多提意见，全站开会讨论，各段站长办事能力不够不能胜任，或有其他情形者，可以调动。有了埋没的职工可以提升，华北职工干部学校，铁路第一批先抽调进步的青年职工五百人受训，第二批准备再去五百人，华北大学也答应收二百人，学习期间本人按供给制待遇，家庭仍给本人工资的百分之六十至百分之八十。
    （４）列车乘务员负责制：机车已实行包乘制，列车上也要实行每一列车有列车长、车长、查票员、检车匠、车僮等人，分两班轮乘，各班之间，互相竞赛，可以推动工作的进步。列车上的清洁秩序必须整理，特快可以对号买票，广播安装起来，列车乘务可以向旅客做一些宣传工作。
    （５）军运问题：军运由运输司令部办理，大军南下之后，路局可设军运课。新的军运条例已由军委会颁布，开始实行时，可能有些困难，应当设法克服。至于军运条例，对个别条文还有意见，由运输司令部提出呈请军委会研究。铁路职工对于军人态度要和霭，多请解释，严禁对军人耍态度。但条例仍要坚持，发生争执，公安段应协助处理。
    （６）学习问题：局内规定每人每日学习一小时半，局长至全体员工，人人必须参加，学习内容以政治为主，同时进行必要的业务学习。其计划由学委会制定，并由学委会领导学习。段站长应成为学习模范。同时对于规章，必须努力学习，因规章是经验的总结。作业内规可由各站自订，呈局核准。
    （７）建立各种必要制度：
    （一）奖惩制度—好的要奖，坏的必罚，以奖励为主，提高大家服务的热情，奖励采取奖金登报表扬的方法，天津已奖励了八十多人，那些护厂有功，清点积极，生产努力的职工均应记功发奖。我们要创造模范站长、模范调度员。以模范以典型推动全盘工作。东北的铁牛号机车安全走行了十万六千公里未经甲检，已经成为全国的模范，我们都应当向他学习。奖励好的批评坏的，应成为铁路的奖惩制度。
    （二）建立请示报告制度—各单位要有工作计划，每月要有工作总结，重大事情都要请示报告。
    （三）建立检查工作制度—各部负责人对于所属均应检查，不能只坐在办公室里兜圈子。站长每日上班时，应当会同有关人员检查车站设备和工作，交换班时也应如此。车务段长要经常巡视检查各站，每次检查结果，要做报告呈局。
    （四）建立朝会制度—主要在传达命令，报告特殊事项，不必天天点名，讲话不要太长，各部份都要提倡有早到晚下班的习惯。反对迟到早退的现象。
    （８）改变劳动态度及作风：铁路已为人民所有，劳动态度与作风必须改变，每个人要拿出主人翁的姿态来为人民铁路服务。首先要发扬民主化作风，局内决定每半月召开一次职工代表会议，吸收工人的意见。各段站会议以至局务会议，都要有职工代表参加，各段应迅速建立职工代表会和生产管理委员会，吸收工人参加管理铁路。第二要密切联系群众依靠群众；离开群众，则一事无成。第三提倡老实朴素的作风，实事求是，不说谎话，不做假报告，不吹牛拍马。第四要提倡亲自动手的作风，反对官僚主义的领导，反对只说不做事务主义文牍主义的作风。
    此外提议实行固定同班制，从调度所到段站都实行同班负责制，这样既可互相竞赛彼此又容易熟习情形，便于工作。
    大家所提的意见特别职工代表提出改进车站的意见，十分合实际，这是很好的，路局应当听取大家的好的意见，至于各种困难问题，路局亦应极力解决，并望各段站亦应自己努力解决，应抱兴家立业的思想与作风，努力克服困难。大家回去后，召开全体职工大会共同讨论研究，彻底实行负责制，为完成国家给予我们的重大任务而努力。
