　　Harbin factories, from the winter of 1947 when they began experimenting with establishing the New Democratic Youth League, have now seen its organizations universally established in over a hundred major public factories and a portion of private factories. The city's 3,210 youth league members in factories (accounting for 47% of all league members and 12.9% of young workers) have used their exemplary actions on the production front to create a wealth of vivid achievements.

　　All of the League's activities in the factories revolve around production. Some have exceeded standards in output and quality, some have taken the lead in competitions and meritorious service, becoming heroes and models, and some have researched and developed new methods in saving materials, waste utilization, and machine part modification. 60% to 80% of the youth league members in municipal enterprise factories have received recognition for meritorious service. The experimental group of the Electric Power Bureau used to repair only twenty or so transformers per month. Thanks to the efforts of the league members and their mastery of technology, this gradually increased to over a hundred. In the past, the Experimental Factory wasted a lot of materials and labor when making steam valves. League member Wu Shouyong researched and improved the steam valve design, which not only saved labor, but also increased the daily output from forty sets of steam valves to sixty. When the youth league members of the Automobile Factory were overhauling new vehicles during the "May 1st" production competition last year, they encountered the difficulty of a severe shortage of parts (which were also hard to buy on the market). The league members mobilized everyone to search through the scrap metal piles. One league member found parts such as propeller shafts, carriage springs, pressure rollers, and screws worth over 2 million yuan, solving the difficulty. During the winter clothing production competition last year, the league members of the Military Supplies Bureau's factories were the first to respond to the administrative call, launching challenges. All teams with league members completed or exceeded their tasks, and organized inspection teams during the competition to overcome some phenomena of cutting corners. As a result, the Military Supplies Bureau attached great importance to the role of the League, and four model branches were rewarded at the summary meeting.

　　The experience of establishing the League in Harbin factories also proves that only a youth league that plays a role in production can be valued and its work can develop quickly. Another important task of the League in the factories is to organize various studies for league members and young workers, with the aim of raising their class consciousness, strengthening their sense of ownership, and establishing new labor concepts. This education is mainly conducted in conjunction with production. They organized "Young Workers' Lectures," which were held once a week and have been given more than forty times. The number of attendees has gradually increased, with a total of over 40,000 listeners. The content includes current events, policies, youth self-cultivation, and study issues. The duration is no more than one and a half hours. After the lecture, each branch puts on a show or shows a movie. Sometimes, induction ceremonies are held. This form is fresh and lively and is very popular among young workers.

　　50% of the workers in Harbin, and about 30% of the young workers, are illiterate or only know a few words. Now, with youth league members as the backbone, a literacy movement is being carried out, which has achieved great results. The main ways of learning are to establish formal night schools, organize small literacy classes, or freely combine to form mutual aid groups, with those who know how to read teaching those who don't. In addition, the youth leagues of various factories run blackboards, wall newspapers, "roll call platforms," question-and-answer columns, or organize correspondence groups, editorial groups, libraries, and hold speech contests and tests, which have played a significant role in learning.

　　Young workers learning technology is a very important issue in factory production. We learn technology through the universally developed "respect the teacher and love the apprentice" movement. The Harbin Iron Factory also organized "Technical Training Classes," inviting the factory director and veteran workers to give young workers three technical lessons every week. League members at the Automobile Factory repaired a car in their spare time. In two months, more than forty league members and young workers learned to drive cars.

　　Cultural and recreational activities in Harbin's factories are now more active than before, which is inseparable from the establishment and efforts of the Youth League. For example, the Dongjian Cement Factory had never put on a play before. With the active leadership of the Youth League, it has now established a club, a literacy class, and organized a choir, and has performed more than twenty plays, which the workers are very happy about. It is now proven that youth are the main force in mass cultural and recreational activities. The artistic talents of young workers are demonstrated in Harbin's cultural and recreational activities. Young workers write plays, compose songs, direct, and perform very well themselves. Organizing cultural and recreational competitions is a very effective way to promote cultural and recreational activities. It can involve the masses in the movement and inspire their enthusiasm and creativity. Only fourteen teams participated in Harbin's first youth workers' singing competition, with nearly three hundred people. Three months later, the second competition increased to twenty-eight teams, with a total of 850 people. In addition, sports activities for young workers were promoted, and youth workers' ball games were organized. Since cultural and recreational activities are carried out in leisure time and attention is paid to not increasing everyone's fatigue, they directly support production.

　　The organizational life of the Harbin Factory Youth League has become more substantial and lively, moving away from simple small group meetings, criticism, and self-criticism. "League Day" and "Commending Models" are two good approaches. "League Day" is held every two weeks (or irregularly). On this day, league members from a region, factory, school, or small group gather in one place to study the League's work, invite people to report on political current events, or hold discussions, lectures, or tell stories. Finally, they put on a cultural performance. In short, it makes league members (young workers) feel relaxed and happy, and allows them to learn something. Appropriate criticism should be given for the mistakes and shortcomings of league members, and more encouragement should be given for the good performance of league members. In particular, constantly calling on league members to learn from models and encouraging their desire to move forward has played a very significant role.

　　Due to the educational role of the League, the class and political consciousness of young people has been rapidly improved after joining the League. Many people regard "becoming a Communist Party member" as their goal, and in the open Party building process, league members not only participate in publicity and meetings, but also actively sign up to apply for Party membership. Many league members have gloriously joined the Party.

　　League members cherish the factory like their own home, and some factory league members automatically take turns on night duty during festivals and holidays to guard the factory. League members at the Automobile Factory risked their lives in firefighting. League members at the Harbin Iron Factory raised awareness of frequent machine damage and finally discovered the Kuomintang's special agent activities. For the factory's public work, such as managing food, cleaning the yard, organizing warehouses, and helping the cooperative transport flour and coal, youth league members always lead the masses to do it. These have given the masses a good impression and won the support of the broad masses.

### 哈尔滨工厂青年团生产战线上称模范

　　哈尔滨工厂青年团
  　生产战线上称模范
    哈尔滨工厂从一九四七年冬开始试验建立新民主主义青年团到目前为止，百余个主要公营工厂及一部份私营工厂里的组织，已经普遍建立起来了。全市三千二百一十名青工团员（占全体团员百分之四十七，青年工人的百分之十二·九）在生产战线上，用自己的模范行动，创造了丰富的生动的事迹。
    团在工厂里的一切活动是围绕着生产进行的。他们有的在产量、质量上超过标准，有的在竞赛立功中积极带头成为英雄模范，有的在节约利废，改造机件上钻研出新办法。市政企业各厂青年团员有百分之六十到八十立了功，电业局试验股以前每月能修出变电器二十多台，由于团员带头努力并掌握技术，逐渐增加到百余台。实验工厂过去做汽门费料很费工，团员吴守永研究改造了汽门样子，不但节省人工，产量每天由作汽门四十套增加到六十套。汽车厂的青年团员在去年“五一”生产竞赛整修新车时，遇到零件奇缺的困难（市面也不好买），团员们发动大伙到废铁堆中去找，一个团员就找出推进轴、车弓子、压轮、螺丝等零件价值二百余万元，解决了困难。军需一局各厂团员在去年冬衣生产竞赛运动中，首先起来响应行政的号召，发动挑战，凡有团员的队都完成或超过任务，在竞赛中组织检查小组，克服了某些偷工减料的现象。因之，一局行政极为重视团的作用，在总结大会上有四个模范支部受到奖励。
    哈市工厂建团经验也证明：只有在生产上起作用的青年团才能受人重视，团的工作才能很快的发展起来。团在工厂的另一重要工作是组织团员与青工的各种学习，目的在于提高他们的阶级觉悟，加强其主人翁感觉，树立新的劳动观念，这种教育主要是结合生产来进行的。他们组织了“青工讲座”，每周开讲一次，已讲了四十余次，每次人数逐渐增加，听讲者共约四万人以上。讲的内容有时事、政策、青年修养、学习问题等。时间不超过一点半钟，讲完后由各支部表演节目或放电影。有时举行入团仪式。这种形式新鲜活泼，极受青工们的欢迎。
    哈市工人中有百分之五十，青工中约有百分之三十的人是文盲或仅识不多的字，现在以青年团员为骨干，开展识字运动，收到很大的效果。学习的方式主要是成立正规夜校，或组织小型的识字班，或是自由结合组织互助小组，识字的教不识字的。此外各工厂青年团主办了黑板报、壁报、点将台、问答栏，或组织了通讯组，编辑组，图书室，举办演讲比赛、测验等，都在学习上起了不少作用。
    青工学习技术在工厂生产中是一个极重要的问题，我们通过普遍发展的尊师爱徒运动来学习技术，在哈尔滨铁工厂还组织了“技术讲习班”，请厂长、老工友每星期定期给青工讲三次技术课，汽车厂团员在工余修好了一辆汽车，两个月中四十多个团员青工都学会了驾驶汽车。
    现在哈市各工厂的文娱活动比以前活跃了，这和青年团的建立与努力是分不开的。如东建洋灰厂过去从来没有演过戏，在青年团积极带头下，现在建立了俱乐部、识字班，组织了合唱队，演出了二十多个戏，工人们非常高兴。现在证明：青年是群众文娱活动的主力，哈市文娱活动中表现了青工们的艺术天才，青工自己编剧、作歌、导演，也演得很好。组织文娱竞赛是推动文娱活动的一种很有效的方式，它能使广大群众卷入运动，启发其积极性、创造性。哈市第一次青工歌咏比赛，仅有十四队参加，近三百人，三个月以后第二次比赛时即增加为二十八队，共八百五十人。此外还提倡青工的体育活动，组织了青年工人的球赛。由于文娱活动是在生产之暇进行的，并注意了不使大家增加疲劳，对生产起直接配合作用。
    哈尔滨工厂青年团的组织生活，已经从过去单纯的开小组会，批评检讨，变得充实活泼起来了，“团日”和“表扬模范”是两种很好的方式、“团日”每两周一次（或不定期），到这一天，一个地区，一个工厂、学校，或一个小组的团员们都聚集在一个地方，研究团的工作，请人报告政治时事或开讨论会，讲书，讲故事，最后表演一次文娱节目，总之使团员（青工）们感到轻松愉快，能学到东西。对于团员的错误缺点应展开适当的批评，对于团员的好的表现应更多的鼓励，尤其经常号召团员向模范看齐，鼓励其前进心，起了很的大作用。
    由于团的教育作用，青年们在入团后阶级的与政治的觉悟是迅速提高了。许多人都把“做个共产党员”当作自己的努力目标，在公开建党中，团员们不但参加宣传和会议，而且积极报名申请入党，好多团员光荣入党了。
    团员们对于工厂象自己的家一样爱护备至，有的工厂团员在年节假日自动轮流值夜，看护工厂、汽车厂的团员在救火中奋不顾身。哈尔滨铁工厂的团员从机器常受损害提高警觉，终于发现了三青团的特务活动。对于工厂的公共工作，如管理伙食，打扫院房，整理仓库以及帮助合作社运粉搬煤，青年团员总是带起群众去做。这些都给群众以良好影响，受到广大群众的拥护。
