　　Suburban District Chiefs' Meeting Decides to
  　Focus on Land Registration
    [Our Newspaper] The Suburban Committee of the Beijing Municipal People's Government held a continued Suburban District Chiefs' Meeting on the 14th. Regarding the survey and registration of land in the suburban districts of Beijing, it was decided to immediately begin registration with a focus. Currently, land measurement in six and a half districts has been completed. Land in new districts and land that has not yet been measured and surveyed will be carried out in coordination with the Land Administration Bureau's land measurement. All registration forms will be uniformly issued by the People's Government. Regarding the issue of cooperative production loans, it was decided that the Beijing Cooperative Bank would coordinate with spring plowing to issue a spring loan. In addition, a preliminary discussion was held on the issue of burdens in the suburbs. (Bai Sheng)
