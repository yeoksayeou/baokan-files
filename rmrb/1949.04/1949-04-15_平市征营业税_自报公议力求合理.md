Ping City Levies Business Tax
　Self-Declaration and Public Discussion Strive for Reasonableness

[This Newspaper] News: The Ping City's business tax collection method for this spring has been officially announced by the Ping City People's Government and will be implemented starting from the 14th. This reporter visited Peng Tao, Deputy Director of the Ping City Taxation Bureau, to learn about the relevant issues. Deputy Director Peng first spoke about the unreasonable phenomena of various taxes under the Kuomintang rule in Beiping. The first type was apportionment exceeding the formal tax: For example, the Xin Chang Industrial Firm in this city paid formal taxes in 1937 (income tax, stamp tax, business tax, house tax, etc.) whose tax amount was equivalent to 386.8125 kg of millet based on the then price, accounting for 47 percent of the total tax amount. Various apportionments (military service fees, guild membership fees, city defense fees, autonomous donations, chamber of commerce membership fees, water association membership fees, district office subsidies, miscellaneous apportionments from Bao offices, etc., totaling more than ten kinds) were equivalent to 452.3125 kg of millet, accounting for 52.8 percent of the total burden. Today, such apportionment no longer exists, and the people's burden has obviously been reduced by more than half.

The second type was that powerful big merchants did not pay taxes or bore very light burdens, while some small businesses bore very heavy burdens. For example, the Minsheng Vegetable Oil Company inside Huanghua Gate in the inner six districts never paid taxes because the company's manager, Han Shouqing, was a Kuomintang-approved Senator. The Great Wall Printing Factory at No. 181 Xuanwumen Inner Street (now closed down) was related to the war criminal Sun Lianzhong and also never paid taxes. The Hebei Enterprise Company (in Lanman Hutong) and the Dahua Printing Factory (in Hufangqiao), which were related to Kuomintang secret service chief Guo Zijun, also never paid taxes. In addition, large stores such as Shanghai Department Store paid a tax of 378 yuan in Renminbi at that time (based on the exchange rate of 10 yuan in pseudo-Gold Yuan notes to 1 yuan in People's Currency, the same below), China Yuan Company should have paid 316 yuan, Hengdeli Watch Shop should have paid 53.4 yuan, Hua'an Hotel 18.1 yuan, and Donglaishun Restaurant 302 yuan. Small businesses such as Yun Sheng Radio Repair Shop (one room, two people) had a tax amount as high as 1,120 yuan, and Heji Transport Business (one room, one person) had a tax amount of 500 yuan, which was even higher than those large businesses. These all should be reasonably changed. He said that the new collection method is for a reasonable burden, and the most important thing is to abolish the unreasonable so-called "simplified tax collection method" of the past and replace it with the self-declaration and public discussion method. And from the perspective of the use of tax revenue, it is completely different. Everyone understands: the taxes collected by the Kuomintang were used for the reactionary civil war and to satisfy the extravagant enjoyment of a few people. Today, the taxes collected by the People's Government are mainly used for Ping City's production and construction, municipal construction, as well as cultural education and social security, truly and unreservedly achieving taking from the people and using for the people.

### 平市征营业税　自报公议力求合理

　　平市征营业税
  　自报公议力求合理
    【本报讯】平市本年度春季营业税征收办法，已由北平市人民政府正式公布，从十四日开始实施。记者曾走访平市税务局彭涛副局长，了解有关这一问题的情况。彭副局长首先谈起在国民党统治北平时，各种税收的不合理现象。第一种是摊派超过正税：如本市信昌实业商行，三十七年所出的正税（所得税，印花税，营业税房捐等）税额以当时物价折合小米计算，为三八六斤十三两，占全部税额百分之四十七。各种摊派（兵役费，公会会费，城防费，自治捐，商会会费，水会会费，区公所补助费，保公所零星摊派等十数种），折合小米四五二斤五两，占全部负担百分之五二点八。今天这种摊派完全不存在了，人民负担很明显的减轻了一多半。
    第二种是有权势的大商人不纳税或负担很轻，有些小商号负担却很重。如内六区黄化门内民生植物油公司从来没有纳过税，因为该公司经理韩受卿是国民党御用的参议员。宣武门内大街一八一号长城印刷厂（现在已歇业）和战犯孙连仲有关，也从没有纳过税。与国民党特务头子郭紫峻有关系的河北企业公司（在烂漫胡同）和大华印刷厂（在虎坊桥）也都是从来不纳税的。另外，大商店如上海百货公司，当时纳税额合人民币三七八元（以伪金元券十元折合人民券一元以下同），中原公司应纳税额三一六元，亨得利钟表行应纳税额五三元四角，华安饭店一八元一角，东来顺饭庄三○二元。小商号如云声无线电修理行（一间房二个人），税额高到一、一二○元，和记运转商（一间房一个人）税额五○○元，竟高于那些大商号。这都是应该合理改变的。他说，新的征稽办法是为了负担合理的，其中最重要的是废除了以往那种不合理的所谓“简化征税办法”，代之以自报公议办法。而从征收税款的用途来看，更是完全不同。谁都明白：国民党征收的税款是用在进行反动的内战上，和满足少数人奢侈享受，今天人民政府所收的税款，主要用在平市的生产建设、市政建设以及文化教育社会治安上面，真正不折不扣的作到了取之于民用之于民。　　　　　　　　　　　　（建、宇）
