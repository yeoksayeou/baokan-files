The 41st Army Garrisoning Beiping Set Off Today to March South
  Soldiers of All Units Took Oaths Before Departure
  Citizens Expressed Heartfelt Gratitude and Presented Banners to See Them Off
    [Report from Our Newspaper] The 41st Army of the Fourth Field Army, which was responsible for the garrison of Beiping, began its southward march today. The 121st Division under its command was scheduled to depart from its garrison area at 7:30 this morning, passing through Beichi Zi, Nanchi Zi, West Chang'an Street, Xidan Archway, Xuanwu Gate, Caishi Kou, and out of Guang'an Gate to the south. Before leaving the city, the unit conducted a thorough discipline inspection and visited residents door-to-door to bid farewell to the citizens of Beiping.
    [Report from Our Newspaper] The divisions and directly subordinate units of the 41st Army of the Fourth Field Army, which served as the garrison force in Beiping, held soldiers' representative conferences separately from the 12th to the 13th on the eve of their southward march, in response to the call from higher authorities and to complete the southward march mission. More than 3,000 representatives, representing all commanders and fighters of the army, including platoon representatives and cadres and soldiers who had received two or more major commendations, enthusiastically expressed their determination to resolutely complete the southward mission assigned by the Party under the banner of Chairman Mao, and to carry forward the spirit of consolidating the troops, uniting and helping each other, maintaining strict discipline, and not violating the people's interests.
    At the soldiers' representative conference of the 121st Division, the People's Government of the Inner Sixth District, the Sixth Branch of the Public Security Bureau, the Workers' Committee, the Trade Union, the Women's Federation, various organizations, and all staff of the Sixth District Government presented the division with two bright red banners inscribed with "March to Jiangnan" and "Liberate All of China." Representatives of the People's Governments of the Inner Third, Inner Fifth, and Inner Sixth Districts, as well as worker representatives, delivered farewell speeches, guaranteeing to resolutely produce and support the front lines in the rear. Under the dazzling red flags, the great strength of the military and the people was fully displayed, strongly inspiring the soldiers' determination to march south. The representatives attending the meeting enthusiastically expressed their determination, launched a high-level revolutionary heroism competition, and established collective and individual merit-making regulations. The soldiers' representatives unanimously shouted: "Resolutely cross the Yangtze River! Liberate all the people of China!" The direct subordinate team put forward four "mores" (more understanding, more research, more help, more education) and five "no departures" (no departure without inspection, no departure without compensation for damaged items, no departure without tidying up, no departure without saying goodbye, no departure through fields with crops). Other regiments also guaranteed that there would be no non-combat attrition, strict discipline would be maintained, and the people's interests would not be violated. The first task was to complete the arduous marching mission. Wang Xiangnian, the representative of the First Battalion of the 367th Regiment of the 123rd Division, not only expressed the determination of the entire battalion to persist in the southward march at the division's conference but also humbly reviewed many past shortcomings, vowing to learn from the class brothers who have mastered excellent work styles in the thousands of miles of long march to complete this historical mission, and to ensure that the excellent qualities of the Communist Party are brought into play, taking the lead in everything, and unreservedly implementing the call of the Party, Chairman Mao, and Commander-in-Chief Zhu. When expressing their determination to march south and cross the river, the representatives of the Second Battalion of the 367th Regiment specifically stated: 1. Consolidate unity and thoroughly ensure that officers love soldiers and soldiers love officers. 2. Guarantee not to bow to difficulties, reduce non-combatants, and minimize attrition. Even if they don't eat well, drink well, or sleep well, they guarantee not to complain or grumble. 3. Guarantee to implement the Three Main Rules of Discipline and the Eight Points for Attention, and absolutely respect the customs and habits of the local people, truly ensuring that not a single needle or thread is taken from the masses, and that the interests of the masses are regarded as their own interests. On the point of safeguarding the interests of the masses, a certain mortar company also called on all commanders and fighters on the spot, "Not to step on a single seedling of the people, and not to let horses eat a single bite of tree bark" along the way. While vowing to liberate the people of Jiangnan, all the soldiers of the Fourth Company of the 368th Regiment challenged all companies of the entire division to help backward comrades and open up their minds. Teng Yuhe, the representative of the Third Company of the 366th Regiment of the 122nd Division, proposed to ensure the unity and love of the entire company, and to carry the sick soldiers to Jiangnan if necessary. In addition to firmly vowing "Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, we will carry the revolution through to the end, without wavering or compromise, unite and consolidate, not violate the people's interests, fight to Jiangnan, realize true peace, and liberate all of China!" all units of the company also resolved to issue a letter of farewell to all institutions, organizations, fathers, elders, brothers and sisters in Beiping, stating "We will use practical actions to answer your condolences to us, and we will plant the banners you gave us all over South China, and under the banner of Mao Zedong, strive for national victory!"
