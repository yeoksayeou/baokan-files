Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 10th: Three field armies of the Chinese People's Liberation Army are actively preparing to cross the Yangtze River to the south in order to achieve genuine peace in accordance with the eight peace terms of the Chinese Communist Party, and liberate the more than 200 million compatriots in the south of the Yangtze. The Second Field Army and the Third Field Army, formerly the Central Plains People's Liberation Army and the East China People's Liberation Army, have now mostly gathered on the northern bank of the Yangtze River. The Fourth Field Army, formerly the Northeast People's Liberation Army, is steadily advancing south. The Kuomintang army defending the southern bank of the Yangtze River and the vast area south of it mainly consists of about 300,000 troops distributed in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River and about 200,000 troops distributed in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River. Their total number is still less than the number of enemy troops annihilated by the People's Liberation Army in the Huaihai Campaign, and their quality is much lower. The vast number of patriotic officers and soldiers at the middle and lower levels of these armies, and some patriotic senior generals, are eager for the Kuomintang government to quickly accept and implement the eight terms of the CCP in order to achieve democratic peace and reorganize their troops into people's armies in accordance with democratic principles. On the side of the People's Liberation Army, which bears the glorious task of liberating the whole country, the morale is now incomparably high. The soldiers of the Liberation Army are eagerly requesting their superiors to quickly issue the order to advance to the south of the Yangtze River. The people in the liberated areas, inspired by victory, are enthusiastically supporting the advance of the Liberation Army. All railways, highways and major roads in the countryside north of the Yangtze River are being repaired. From the Yalu River to the banks of the Yangtze River, grain and laborers are steadily moving south with the army. The waterways along the river have been dredged, and tens of thousands of boats are waiting to transport the Liberation Army across the Yangtze River. The people south of the Yangtze River have long been eagerly awaiting the People's Liberation Army, and are now also taking active actions to welcome the Liberation Army. The armed struggles of the people from Hainan Island to the southern bank of the Yangtze River, and the parades and demonstrations of patriotic students in Nanjing and other cities demanding genuine peace, show that the broad masses of people south of the Yangtze River are irresistibly surging into the great struggle to liberate all of China.

Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains Front, 9th: All units of the Second Field Army (formerly the Central Plains People's Liberation Army) are actively preparing to overcome the various difficulties they may encounter in advancing to the south of the Yangtze River. Every cadre and soldier in a certain unit has been supplied with three pairs of cloth shoes, three towels and other sufficient daily necessities, and each animal has been prepared with more than two spare horseshoes. A surge of making straw sandals has been widely launched in various units. Those who know how to make them are actively helping those who do not. Eleven soldiers in a certain unit helped everyone make one hundred pairs of straw sandals. In order to move lightly and quickly, various units have launched a movement to travel light, with general personal luggage not exceeding eight catties. In order to train for long-distance marching with heavy loads, everyone in the sixth company of a certain unit automatically carries two or three bricks on their backs when running every morning. Li Derong, a cook in his forties from a certain unit, is afraid of not being able to keep up with the troops, so he gets up early and late to exercise his strength so that he has the strength to carry loads when marching. Many soldiers encouraged him and said: "Good old Li, this energy is enough to cross the river." The staff of the Second Field Army General Branch of Xinhua News Agency have also stipulated that they should bring their own office supplies and necessary documents and insist on working during the march. The newspapers of the directly affiliated teams of the Field Army have continuously published introductions to the Yangtze River Basin and other places, so that everyone is familiar with the various specific situations in various places. The workers in the publishing office printed various documents and propaganda materials needed for the southward advance day and night for five days, and some people worked continuously for thirty hours.

　　千军万马云集长江北岸
  　三大野战军待命南渡
    从东北到长江粮食民工络绎于途
    【新华社北平十日电】中国人民解放军的三支野战军正在积极准备南渡长江，以便按照中国共产党的八项和平条件，实现真和平，解放江南的两万万以上的同胞。第二野战军和第三野战军即原中原人民解放军和华东人民解放军，现已大部云集长江北岸。第四野战军即原东北人民解放军正在源源南下。防守长江南岸及其以南广阔地区的国民党军，主要的是分布于长江下游的约三十余万人和分布于长江中游的约二十万人，其总数尚少于人民解放军在淮海战役中所歼灭的敌军的数目，其质量更低得多。这些军队的广大的中下级爱国官兵，和某些有爱国心的高级将领，都渴望国民党政府能够迅速接受和执行中共的八项条件，以便实现民主的和平，并将自己的队伍按照民主原则改编为人民军队。在负着解放全国的光荣任务的人民解放军方面，现在的士气是无比地高涨。解放军的战士们急切地请求着上级迅速下达向江南进军的命令。被胜利所鼓舞的解放区人民，热情地支援着解放军进军。所有长江以北的铁路、公路和乡村中的大路都在抢修中。从鸭绿江到长江边，粮食和民工正随着大军源源南下。沿江的河道已经疏浚，成千成万条船只正等待着把解放军运过长江去。长江以南的人民对人民解放军早已望眼欲穿，现在也正以积极的行动来迎接解放军。从海南岛到长江南岸的人民武装斗争，和南京等城市爱国学生要求真和平的游行示威，表示长江以南的广大人民正不可遏止地涌入到解放全中国的伟大斗争中。
    【新华社中原前线九日电】第二野战军（原中原人民解放军）各部正积极准备克服向江南进军中可能遇到的各种困难。某部每个干部、战士都补充了三双布鞋，三条毛巾和其他足够的日用品，每匹牲口都准备了两副以上的备用马掌。打草鞋的热潮已在各部普遍展开，会打的人都积极帮助不会打的人，某部十一个战士帮助大家打了一百双草鞋。为了行动轻便迅速，各部都发起了轻装运动，一般随身行李不超过八斤。某部六连为了锻炼负重长途行军，每天早上跑步时，每个人自动背上二三块砖跑步。某部四十多岁的炊事员李德荣怕跟不上部队，早晚起来锻炼体力，以便挑担赶路时有劲。许多战士都鼓励着他说：“好老李，这个劲头过江够了。”新华社第二野战总分社的工作人员也已规定了自带办公用具和必要文件准备在行军中坚持工作。野战军直属队的报纸则连续刊登了对长江流域等地的介绍，使大家熟悉各地的各种具体情况。出版处的工人在五天内不分昼夜地印出了南进时需用的各种文件和宣传品，有的人曾连续工作了三十小时。
