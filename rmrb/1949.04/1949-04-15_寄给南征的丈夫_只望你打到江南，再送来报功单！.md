To My Husband Marching South
　"I Only Hope You Fight to the South of the Yangtze, and Send Another Citation!"
　　Bo Yun
　　The sun rises, red and bright,
　　I'm spinning cotton in the yard,
　　Suddenly I hear drums and gongs on the street,
　　I think to myself:
　　"Sounds like they're bringing me a citation."
　　No sooner said than done,
　　Our brother rushes into the yard, shouting:
　　"Sister-in-law, sister-in-law, hurry and receive it,
　　The district is sending Brother's citation!"
　　I'm half believing, half doubting,
　　"Jinxi, you're teasing me again."

　　I was just about to go to the street and see,
　　When the Women's Association director greets me.
　　"Xianmei, I'm here to give you good news,
　　Guess whose citation has been sent?"
　　I say, "I can't guess,"
　　But I think, "Isn't it obvious!"

　　The fiery sun shines all over the yard,
　　The trumpets and drums sound to the heavens.
　　Four people carry a golden plaque,
　　The eye-catching citation is so bright.

　　The yard is usually not small,
　　But that day it seemed like there wasn't enough space.
　　People inside are shouting, "Don't push!"
　　People outside are shouting, "Can't see!"
　　The village chief loudly reads the citation:
　　"Jinqun has performed meritorious service in the Huaihai Campaign,
　　Captured twenty enemy soldiers,
　　Seized two machine guns,
　　First-class meritorious hero, number one."

　　Applause claps resound loudly,
　　Everyone in the yard praises:
　　"Jinqun is the best of the young men in our village,
　　He really is capable."

　　Groups of young sisters,
　　Chatter around me,
　　One asking about this,
　　Another asking about that.
　　Deliberately asking me:
　　"Do you like it or not?"

　　The model squad's Erniu brother,
　　Suggests I say a few words.
　　When one branch of a tree sways, all branches move,
　　The yard is filled with applause.

　　Before I can speak, my face turns red,
　　I stammer and only say half a sentence:
　　"Without the Communist Party and Chairman Mao,
　　How could we have this day!"

　　The sun sets in the west, the sky turns dark,
　　I spin cotton again under the moon.
　　Spinning and thinking,
　　Quickly eliminate all the reactionaries.

　　Water is connected to water,
　　Mountains are connected to mountains,
　　The blood of us poor people
　　Is connected like flesh and blood.
　　The poor people in the South of the Yangtze
　　Suffer from hunger and cold,
　　Rescuing them is the
　　Most important thing!

　　The housework
　　Is on my shoulders,
　　I only hope you fight to the
　　South of the Yangtze—
　　And send another
　　Citation,
　　Citation upon
　　Citation!

　　寄给南征的丈夫
　  “只望你打到江南，再送来报功单！”
    波云
    日头出来红艳艳，
    我正在院里纺棉线，
    忽听街上锣鼓响，
    我心里说：
    “好象给俺送来报功单。”
    话没落音成了真，
    咱兄弟连喊带叫跑进院：
    “嫂子嫂子快去接，
    区里送来俺哥哥的报功单。”
    我心里又信又不信，
    “进喜你又来瞎胡乱。”
　
    我正想去大街看看，
    妇会主任迎上前。
    “先梅我来给你报个喜，
    你猜是送来谁的报功单？”
    我嘴里说：“猜不着，”
    心里说：“那还不明显！”
　
    火红的太阳照满院，
    喇叭锣鼓响连天。
    四个人抬着一块金黄匾，
    照眼的报功单真鲜艳。
　
    院子平常也不算小，
    那天怎的也站不开。
    里边喊着别挤啦！
    外边喊着瞧不见！
    村长大声念着报功单：
    “进群淮海立了功，
    俘虏敌人二十名，
    夺了两挺机关枪，
    头等功臣第一名。”
　
    巴掌拍的哗哗的响，
    院里人人都称赞：
    “咱村青年数进群，
    人家真的算能干。”
　
    年轻姐妹一伙伙，
    叽叽咕咕围住我，
    这个问长，
    那个问短。
    故意问我：
    “喜欢不喜欢？”
　
    模范班的二牛弟，
    提议叫我把话谈。
    树摇一枝百枝动，
    院子里巴掌响连天。
　
    我还没开口红了脸，
    吞吞吐吐只说了半句言：
    “没有共产党毛主席，
    咱们哪有这一天！”
　
    日落西山黑了天，
    月亮底下再纺棉。
    一边纺着一边想，
    快把反动派来消灭完。
　
    水连水，
    山连山，
    咱穷人的血
    相连肉相关。
    江南的穷人
    受饥寒，
    解救他们最
    当先！
　
    家里的活儿
    有我干，
    只望你打到
    江南——
    再送来报功
    单，
    报功单上再
    挂报功单！
