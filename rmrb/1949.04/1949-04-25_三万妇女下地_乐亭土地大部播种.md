　　30,000 Women Go to the Fields
    Most of the Land in Leting is Sown
    [Jidong Telegraph] Over 34,000 women in Leting County have participated in spring plowing and sowing, with 8,000 in the Sixth District alone. The combination of meticulous organizational work and ideological education that establishes the glory of labor has made the broad masses of rural women an important force in agricultural production. The district has achieved particularly remarkable results in organizing the families of martyrs, soldiers, and cadres to participate in production. Among the 8,644 family members of martyrs, soldiers, and cadres who actively participated in agricultural production, there were 4,441 women, thus overcoming the difficulty of insufficient labor. Currently, more than 50% of the county's autumn fields have been sown, and the Fifth District has sown 80% of the total land area. The above figures were obtained within ten days, from the 1st to the 10th of this month. It is estimated that all of the county's autumn fields, except for late crops such as peanuts, will be completely sown by the end of this month. The active participation of the broad masses of women has played an important role in the smooth progress of the county's replanting work.
