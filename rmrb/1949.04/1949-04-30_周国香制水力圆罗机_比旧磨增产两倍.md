　　Zhou Guoxiang Manufactures Water-Powered Circular Flour Mill
  　Doubles Production Compared to Old Mills
    [Taihang Telegram] Comrade Zhou Guoxiang, manager of the Hui County Publicly Operated Hongfeng Flour Mill, after five months of research, has created a water-powered automatic flour-milling circular flour mill. This machine saves half the manpower compared to the old water mills (previously eight people were needed, now only four are required). It can grind 1,400 catties of wheat and produce 1,120 catties of flour per day (calculated on a 24-hour basis). This is nearly double the production increase compared to water mills, which could not grind even 500 catties of wheat per day. The quality of the flour is also better than that ground by the old water mills, and the yield is higher. After inventing the circular flour mill, Comrade Zhou also used water power to create a cotton gin and a cotton batting machine, each. The cotton gin can gin 300 catties of cotton per day, doubling the speed of manual cotton ginning. Manually batting one catty of cotton costs 200 yuan in labor, but Hongfeng only charges 100 yuan. This has solved many difficulties for local residents.

　　周国香制水力圆罗机
  　比旧磨增产两倍
    【太行电】辉县公营宏丰面粉厂经理周国香同志，经过五个月的研究，创造了利用水力自动磨面的圆罗机，此种机器较旧水磨节省人力一倍（过去八人，现在四人即可），每日（以二十四小时计）可磨小麦一千四百斤出面一千一百二十斤。比每日磨不到五百斤麦子就用水磨增产近两倍。面的质量也比旧水磨磨的好，并出的多。在发明了圆罗机之后，周同志又利用水力制置了轧花机、弹花机各一部，轧花机每日轧花三百斤，比人力轧花增快两倍。人力弹花一斤要二百元手工钱，宏丰只收一百元。对当地居民解决不少困难。
