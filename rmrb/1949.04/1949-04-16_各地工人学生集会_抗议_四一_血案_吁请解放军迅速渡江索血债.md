　　Workers and Students in Various Locations Hold Rallies
  　to Protest the "April 1st" Massacre
  　Urge the People's Liberation Army to Swiftly Cross the River and Demand Blood Debts
    [Our Dispatch] To protest the Nanjing "April 1st" massacre of workers and students by the Chiang bandits, workers and students in Tangshan, Zhangjiakou, Baoding, Shijiazhuang, and the Hebei-Shandong-Henan region held angry rallies and parades to protest the bloody crimes of Chiang Kai-shek's die-hard followers. They pointed out that murderers like Tang Enbo and Chen Daqing, even if they escape to the ends of the earth, must be arrested and brought to justice to repay the people's blood debts. They also gave righteous support to the heroic struggle of the workers and students in Nanjing and offered heartfelt condolences to the families of the martyrs and the injured. They unanimously urged the People's Liberation Army to quickly cross the Yangtze River and advance south, thoroughly eliminate the remnant forces of the Chiang bandits, and liberate the compatriots in the south of the Yangtze River. The preparatory committee of the Kailuan Tangshan Mine Workers issued a letter of protest, with over seven thousand signatures. All employees of the North Hebei Electric Power Company mourned the martyrs who died in the "April 1st" incident, and called on the unliberated worker brothers to strengthen their unity, concentrate their forces to welcome the arrival of the People's Liberation Army. Tangshan Iron Factory workers, in order to liberate the suffering worker brothers more quickly, donated money to support the southward army, with seventy-six people donating more than two thousand three hundred yuan in Renminbi. Employees from twenty-five units in Zhangjiakou proposed to work an extra half hour and launch a "one yuan" donation campaign to慰问过慰问过 the troops crossing the river and the Nanjing students in distress. The Hebei Middle School Student Union and more than six thousand students from various schools in Baoding held a rally to protest and then paraded to publicize to the citizens, exposing the false peace conspiracy of Chiang Kai-shek's die-hard followers. On the afternoon of the tenth, more than two thousand middle and university students in Tangshan held a revenge and accusation meeting for the Nanjing martyrs at the Jiaotong University Tangshan Institute Square. The Hebei-Shandong-Henan Student Federation, in protesting the "April 1st" massacre, recalled the more than 80,000 compatriots in the area south of the Yellow River who had been killed, ravaged, and captured by the Chiang bandit troops in the past two years, and demanded that the Chiang bandits be held accountable for their blood debts at the same time.
