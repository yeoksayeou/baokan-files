[Jizhong Electric] Due to the sandy soil in Xinle County, scarce snowfall last winter, and drought this spring, severe wind disasters have occurred. From 5:00 AM to 7:00 PM on April 4th, strong winds blew for an entire day, affecting over 190,000 mu of wheat and pea fields in the county to varying degrees. On the south bank of the Dasha River and the Mudao Ditch, as well as in the second, third, sixth, and seventh districts, 80% of the wheat was buried by sand, with some areas covered by as much as three inches. It is estimated that yields may be reduced by 60%; however, this could be mitigated with immediate irrigation. In response, the County Committee has issued urgent instructions: in addition to continuing to investigate the details of the disaster and the affected acreage, it is also calling on the masses to mobilize immediately and actively prevent wind damage. They are to quickly dig out the seedlings buried by sand and irrigate them. For the damaged wheat fields, the masses should be organized to till the land again and prepare to plant crops such as cotton, peanuts, and corn. At the expanded cadre meeting held in the county on the 7th of this month, a special discussion was held on the wind disaster issue. Methods for preventing wind disasters were studied: (1) Because the wind blows against hard surfaces rather than soft ones, the masses should be called upon to universally till the land, especially the land near wheat fields. (2) Dig ditches or pile up soil and build wall tops at wind gaps. According to the principle that "a single blade of grass can block a strong wind," insert windbreaks in the wheat fields, with dry straw stalks inserted diagonally into the wind channels to disperse the wind force.

　　新乐巨风成灾
    县委指示紧急防救
    【冀中电】新乐境内土质多沙，因去冬下雪少，今春又天旱不雨，遂使巨风成灾。自四月四日上午五时起，到下午七时止，大风一直刮了一天，全县十九万多亩麦田及豌豆，均或轻或重的遭受风灾。大沙河和木刀沟南岸及二、三、六、七等四个区的大麦，百分之八十被沙土埋没，厚者达三寸。据估计可能减收百分之六十，如赶紧浇水或可减轻。对此，县委已发出紧急指示：除继续调查受灾详情及受灾亩数外，并号召群众紧急动员起来积极防风。赶快把被沙压住的科苗刨出来，进行浇水，对已被毁坏的麦羁，组织群众重新耕好，准备种棉花、花生、玉蜀黍等作物。在本月七日全县扩干会议上，又对风灾问题作了专题讨论。研究出防风灾的办法：（一）因为风是刮硬不刮软，所以要号召群众普遍耕地，特别是麦田附近的地。（二）在风口挑沟或折土捻，叠墙头。根据“寸草挡大风”的道理，在麦田间插风障，川干草秫秕斜插在风道上分散风力。
