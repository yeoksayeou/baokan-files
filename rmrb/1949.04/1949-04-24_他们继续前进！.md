　　They Continue to Advance!
　　Ji Luyu Branch

　　As dusk approached, Unit × of the People's Liberation Army, heading south across the Yangtze River, arrived at Qingfeng Huacun in the Ji Luyu Plain. Upon hearing that the southward-bound army would be camping in the village, all the farmers, women, youths, students, and children excitedly ran into the streets and outside the village… The students performed Yangko dances, the women shouted slogans, and people of all ages joined the welcoming crowd…

　　The People's Liberation Army, long awaited by the people of Huacun, finally arrived to cross the Yangtze and liberate all of China. How happy they all were! Village Chief Peng Shulin and Farmers' Association Chairman Liu Xin sent people to guide the soldiers of each squad to houses that had been cleaned in advance for them to rest. After the troops settled in, representatives from various village organizations immediately went to the battalion headquarters to express their gratitude to the hardworking soldiers. Women representatives, including Comrade Wu Gaijiao, requested to wash and mend clothes for the commanders and fighters. The responsible comrade of the battalion, fearing it would delay the women's production, immediately declined. However, after repeated requests from Comrade Wu Gaijiao and others, the battalion headquarters relented and agreed to hand over twenty-six shirts belonging to heroes and model soldiers of the battalion to the women representatives. To express their gratitude, the women also voluntarily made ninety-two pairs of sock linings for the soldiers. They said, "With sock linings, your feet won't blister, and you can cross the river sooner, capture the war criminal Chiang Kai-shek alive, and liberate the people of Jiangnan!" In the evening, the villagers voluntarily provided one hundred and thirty quilts for the soldiers to use. Farmers Liu Erhe, Liu Kehuai, Liu Mingyan, and others took off their own coats and let the soldiers on night duty wear them. At the army-civilian get-together the next day, Village Chief Peng Shulin, on behalf of all the villagers, extended greetings and respect to the × battalion of the southward army. He also expressed the hope that the comrades of the troops would resolutely eliminate all reactionary armies unwilling to surrender to the people. Village cadres offered cigarettes to the model soldiers who loved the people on the southern expedition, and the women presented flowers to the combat heroes. Finally, the battalion commander, on behalf of all the commanders and fighters of the battalion, stated, "We will resolutely carry out the orders of our superiors, complete all tasks, and certainly fulfill the demands of all our elders and siblings!"

　　When the troops departed, the battalion headquarters went to each household to inquire and check on the troops' discipline. The masses unanimously replied, "Every item and clause (referring to the Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention) has been well observed; no one has violated them." As soon as the troops left the village, the village cadres went to each household to check if the troops had left anything behind. Upon seeing the village cadres, the villagers quickly handed over items such as pens, bandages, and spoons that the comrades had forgotten. However, the troops had already traveled far from the village, and the village cadres chased after them for more than ten miles before returning the forgotten items. The people's army continues to advance towards the south.

　　他们继续前进！
    冀鲁豫分社
    天快黑的时候，渡江南进的人民解放军×部来到冀鲁豫平原上的清丰花村。一听说南下大军要在该村宿营，全村的农民、妇女、青年、学生和儿童们都兴奋的跑到街上，跑到村外，……学生们扭着秧歌，妇女们喊着口号，男女老少都加入了欢迎的行列……。
    花村人民久所盼望的、要渡江南下解放全中国的解放军终于来到了，他们都是多么高兴啊！村长彭书林、农会长刘信派人把各班战士们带领到各户早已打扫干净的房子去休息。部队住下后，村中各团体代表立即到营部慰问劳苦功高的全营战士们。妇女代表吴改姣等同志并要求给指战员同志拆洗衣服，该营负责同志怕耽误妇女生产，当即谢绝，但经吴改姣等同志再三再四的要求，营部摆脱不过，只得答应把该营功臣和英雄们的二十六件衬衣交给妇女代表。妇女们为了表示她们的心意，还自动帮助战士们做了九十二双袜底。她们说：“垫上袜底，脚上不磨泡，你们好早一天过江，活捉老蒋那战犯，解放江南的人民！”晚上，村里群众自动拿出一百三十条被子给战士们盖。农民刘二合、刘可淮、刘明言等脱下自己身上穿的大袍让夜晚站岗的战士披上。第二天的军民联欢大会上，村长彭书林代表全村群众向南下大军×营慰问致敬。并希望部队同志要对一切不愿向人民投降的反动军队，坚决消灭他们。村干并向南征中的爱民模范点烟，妇女们向各位战斗英雄献花。最后营长代表全营指战员表示：“坚决执行上级命令，完成一切任务，一定答复诸位父老姊妹的要求！”
    当部队出发时，营部到各家询问和检查了部队执行纪律的情形，群众一致的回答：“那条那项（指三大纪律八项注意）都遵守的很好，没一个人违犯。”部队刚走出村外，村干又到各住家检查有无部队遗失的东西，各住家见到村干，便赶快把部队同志忘下的钢笔、绑带、饭勺等物品交给村干。但部队已离村很远，村干追了十几里路，才把忘掉的东西交还了部队。人民的大军向着南方继续前进了。
