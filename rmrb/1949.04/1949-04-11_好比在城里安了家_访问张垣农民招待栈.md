　　“It's Like Having a Home in the City”
    ——Visiting the Zhangyuan Peasant Reception Station
    By Our Reporter, Lü Guangming
    On Xishahe Street in Zhangjiakou City, five eye-catching characters hang on the middle two telephone poles: "Peasant Reception Station." This was established by the Zhangyuan City Supply and Marketing Cooperative to facilitate the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas and solve the problem of food and lodging for peasants entering the city. The station has the following specific services: (1) Introducing, guiding, and helping peasants buy and sell goods. (2) Selling peasant supplies at fair prices within the station and selling agricultural products and furs on their behalf at fair prices, thereby reducing intermediate exploitation. (3) Properly storing goods bought and sold by peasants. During transport, it can handle all transportation procedures on their behalf. (4) Food and fodder are calculated at appropriate prices. Accommodation and occupancy are charged at a low rate, currently stipulated to be 40 to 50 percent lower than private shops and inns. In addition, a special "Peasant Inquiry Office" is set up to answer all questions from peasants entering the city and to guide them on the rules of conduct to be observed when entering the city.

    The station is spacious, covering an area of about ten mu, with rooms painted snow-white and equipped with electric lights, telephones, and running water. On the east side of the yard is a row of ten houses with two large heated brick beds. On the west side of the yard is a row of twenty to thirty mule and horse sheds, with more than a dozen square enclosures in front of the sheds for feeding pigs, sheep, and camels. In the northwest corner, there are seven or eight small single rooms prepared for peasants with families to live in. In the southeast corner, there is a large awning, which is for sheltering vehicles and saddles from rain and snow on cloudy days. Behind the east side of the yard is a large earth cellar, about forty or fifty zhang in circumference, which is specifically for storing grain and goods for peasants. All the villagers who come to stay or inquire are treated with courtesy. On the third day of its opening, the reporter made a special visit. Before 4:00 PM, the station had already received thirty-eight carts, sixty-nine livestock, and more than eighty people. Several peasants from Chahar were driving ox carts to sell grain. At the entrance of the station, one peasant said: "Look, the sign says 'Cooperative.' I think it's run by the government. Let's go in. Wherever the Communist Party occupies, they always take care of us peasants." During the first liberation, the Zhangjiakou City Mass Cooperative had opened a "Peasant General Store" here for a period of time, providing many conveniences to peasants. After the establishment of this Peasant Reception Station, the news quickly spread to the ears of peasants in nearby counties, who said happily: "The Peasant General Store of Zhangjiakou is open again!"

    Peasants living in private shops and inns came to visit the Peasant Reception Station in groups of three or two. They said: "We must come here next time. If we don't understand something, we can also ask, so we don't have to be taken for fools" (meaning to be deceived). After the peasants arrived at the station, cadres and staff members, in addition to diligently taking care of their food and lodging, proactively introduced them to the prices of various necessities, where to sell, where to buy, where the prices are fair, and so on. For example, they introduced several peasants from Chahar to buy more than 300 bolts of coarse cloth from the public store, and introduced a peasant to sell three shi and five dou of wheat. Nearly 300 peasants were received in this way in three days. They brought grain, furs, etc., sold them for money, and bought cloth, cotton, and some daily necessities to take back. When the reporter visited, there were five villagers from Zhangbei who were driving carts to sell grain. They were sitting around a large cage on the heated brick bed, eating. They said with gratitude: "How convenient this is! If you stay in other shops, you only pay for accommodation, and they don't provide cooking, no hot water to drink, and you can't even turn over in your sleep."

    When they left, they said gratefully: "The government takes care of us so well. Next time we come to Zhangjiakou, we will definitely come here again. It's like we villagers have a home in the city."

　　“好比在城里安了家”
    ——访问张垣农民招待栈
    本报记者  吕光明
    张家口市西沙河街，中间的两根电杆上，悬着五个惹人注目的大字：“农民招待栈”。这是张垣市供销合作总社，为沟通城乡物资交流，解决农民入城食宿困难而开设的。该栈有如下几项具体业务：（一）介绍、指导、帮助农民购销货物。（二）栈内以公道价格出售农民用品，并以公道价格代为推销农产品和皮毛等。借以减轻中间剥削。（三）凡农民收售货物，栈内代其妥为保管。运转时，并可代办一切运输手续。（四）食粮草料，按适当价格计算。住宿占用，收费轻微，现规定低于私人店栈的百分之四十到五十。此外特设“农民问事处”，负责解答农民入城后的一切疑问，并指导入城应注意之风纪规则。
    该栈地方宽敞，面积约有十亩左右，房间都刷得雪白，电灯、电话、自来水，设备周全。院东边一排十间房子，有两条大暖炕，院西边是一排二三十间的骡马棚，棚前有十几个方形圈，可以圈喂猪羊和骆驼。西北角上，另有七八个小单间准备给携带家眷的农民住，东南角上，是一个大天棚，这是为了阴天，车辆鞍毡好不受雨雪淋。院房东侧背后，是一个方圆四五丈的大地仓，是专为农民保管粮食和货物的。凡投宿与问事的老乡，都受到殷勤的招待。开办的第三天，记者特去参观，还不到下午四点钟，栈里就来了三十八辆车，六十九个牲口，八十多个人，察北几个农民赶着牛车粜粮食，走到栈门口，一个农民这样说：你看，牌子上写着“合作社”。我看是公家办的，进去吧。共产党无论占到哪里，对咱农民总有个照顾。在第一次解放时，张市大众合作社曾在这里开过一时期的“农民大店”。给农民不少方便，此次农民招待栈成立后，消息很快传布到附近各县农民的耳朵里，他们庆幸的说：“张垣的农民大店又开了！”
    住在私人店里的农民，三一伙，两一伙，到农民招待栈里来参观，他们说：“下回一定来这里住呀，不懂的事，也可问一问，省得咱乡下人叫人捉老憨”（被欺哄的意思）。农民落栈之后，干部、店员除殷勤的照顾其食宿，主动的向他们介绍各种必需品的价格，什么到那里去卖，什么到那里去买，那里的价格公道等等，如介绍几个察北农民到公营商店买了三百多个粗布，另介绍一个农民粜了三石五斗麦子。如此受招待的农民，三天中将近三百个。他们拉来粮食、皮毛等，卖了钱，又买上布匹棉花及一些日用品拉回去。记者参观时，有张北五个赶车卖粮的老乡，在暖炕上，正围着一个大笼吃饭，他们带着感谢的口吻说：“这有多方便！若住别的店，化钱光许住宿，贵贱不给开锅，喝开水没有，睡觉挤得连身也翻不过。”
    临走时，他们感谢的说：“公家照顾我们这样好，下次到了张家口，一定还上这儿来，这里好比咱乡下人在城里安了一座家。”
