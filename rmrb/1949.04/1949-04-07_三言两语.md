　　A Few Words
　　Farmers' Visiting Group
　　Jidong organized a farmers' visiting group to visit Tangshan, strengthening the friendship between the working class and the peasantry and encouraging each other in production through mutual observation. This is a very good and vivid example. As farmer Yang Zhenquan said, "The workers use machines and want to lead us forward. The worker brothers are walking in front, and we are following behind." When farmers see large machines and collective labor, and intimately understand the progressive mode of production and its benefits to the people, they can free themselves from individualistic and conservative viewpoints and move towards a worker-peasant alliance to jointly shoulder the task of transforming an agricultural country into an industrial one.
　　Making Friends with Farmers
　　At the same time, various lively ways should be used to help workers understand the peasantry, this great ally, and the importance of agricultural production. Many workers in newly liberated large and medium-sized cities have long been unable to join hands with the peasants due to objective environmental limitations. Many of them are unfamiliar with and do not understand the peasantry. Some may even only see the backward aspects of the peasantry, forgetting that it is the most reliable ally of the proletariat, the producer of industrial raw materials, and the main bearer of the national economy. Workers should be mobilized to go to the countryside to make friends with farmers, understand the needs of farmers in production and their living conditions, and establish close friendship with them.

　  三言两语 　 农民参观团
    冀东组织农民参观团到唐山参观，密切工农阶级友情，彼此相互观摩砥砺生产，这是一个很好的生动的范例，农民杨振全说的好：“工人用的是机器，要来带动我们，工人大哥在前面走，我们跟在后面”，农民看到大的机器和集体劳动，亲切地了解了进步的生产方式以及这种进步生产方式对人民的幸福，便可以从个体的保守的观点中解放出来，走向工农联盟，共同担负起由农业国变为工业国的任务。 　 交农民朋友
    同时也要用各种生动活泼的方式帮助工人认识农民这一个伟大的同盟军和了解农业生产的重要性。新解放的许多大中城市的工人由于客观环境的限制，长期没有可能同农民拉起手来，其中不少人对农民是不熟，不懂。甚至可能有人只看到农民某些方面的落后，忘掉了它是无产阶级的最可靠的同盟军，是工业原料的生产者和国民经济主要的负担者，应当发动工人多到乡下去交农民朋友，了解农民生产需要和生活状况，建立同农民的亲密友谊。
