Accepting the Correct Opinions of the Masses
　　Beiping Postal Bureau Carefully Investigates Former Personnel
　　Twenty-Six Spies Dismissed
　　[Reported by Our Newspaper] Since the takeover of the Beiping Postal Bureau, employees have been offering opinions and accusing Kuomintang spies of coercing colleagues to join the Kuomintang and using bribery and fraud to control the labor union. If colleagues disobeyed even slightly, they would be transferred away from Beiping, facing double the financial burden and causing immense pain to their families. Therefore, many colleagues endured in silence, obeying orders, daring to be angry but not daring to speak out. As liberation approached, the activities of spies became even more rampant, and they formed a commando team dedicated to informing and arresting people. The above opinions of the employees, after investigation by representatives of the Military Control Commission, the labor union, and the victims, were found to be based on solid evidence. Therefore, accepting the legitimate demands of the masses, it was initially decided to temporarily suspend sixty-six people from their duties and salaries. After detailed investigation and careful consideration, it was finally decided that Wang Hongye and five others would be dismissed and sent to the Qinghe Brigade for training. Wang Chunfu and eight others would be dismissed. Liu Zhong and ten others were transferred military officers, not postal personnel, and were given severance pay to return to their hometowns. The processing of the above twenty-six people was completed on the twelfth of this month. Other personnel are still under investigation. At the employee meeting convened by the Bureau yesterday (13th) afternoon at 2:00 PM, Comrade Zhang of the Personnel Section explained that the employees' reporting of spies was a manifestation of their increased class consciousness. He called on everyone to promote this sense of political responsibility.

  　特务廿六人被革职
    【本报讯】北平邮政局自接管以后，职工们纷纷提出意见，控告国民党特务分子过去威逼同人加入国民党，用贿赂舞弊办法把持工会。同人稍不服从，就被调离北平，陷入一种收入两种负担，造成家庭的绝大痛苦。同人因此多忍气吞声，听从摆布，敢怒不敢言。快解放时，特务活动更形猖獗，曾组成突击小组，专门做告密和逮捕的勾当。以上职工们的意见书，经军管会代表和职工会及受害人调查，证据确凿，乃接受群众正当要求，初步确定了六十六人暂时停职停薪。然后经过详细调查，慎重考虑，最后确定王洪业等六人革退，送清河大队受训。王春富等九人革退。刘仲等十一人系转业军官，非邮班人员，资遣还乡。以上二十六人已于本月十二日处理完毕。其他人员仍在调查审理中。该局于昨（十三）日下午二时召集职工大会时，人事科张同志说明职工们检举特务的行为，是阶级觉悟提高的表现。并号召大家发扬此种政治责任心。
