[Dispatch from the Yangtze River Front, 25th] Large numbers of new soldiers from Jiangsu and Shandong are pouring into the People's Liberation Army field armies, advancing towards the south of the Yangtze River. Many of these new soldiers are fighters from local troops who have been upgraded after long periods of combat training. When the new soldiers arrive at each unit, they are warmly welcomed. Each unit generally holds symposiums for new and veteran soldiers to introduce combat experience, the life of regular troops, and the situation of production and construction in the rear. Before joining the army, the new soldiers have studied current affairs and recognized the tremendous development of the current revolutionary situation, so their morale is extremely high after joining the army. They all actively learn the experience of large-scale operations from the veteran soldiers.

  　源源涌入野战军南进
    【长江前线二十五日电】江苏、山东大批新战士正源源涌入人民解放军野战大军，向江南开进。新战士中有许多是经过长期战斗锻炼而升级的地方部队的战士。当新战士到达各部时，都受到热烈欢迎。各部普遍地召开了新老战士座谈会，互相介绍战斗经验以及正规部队的生活和后方生产建设的情况。新战士在入伍前都进行了时事学习，认清了当前革命形势的巨大发展，因此入伍后情绪异常高涨。他们都自动地积极向老战士学习大兵团作战的经验。
