[Reported by Jizhong News Agency] The Ba County committees are guilty of seriously wasting manpower, and the county committee has reviewed and corrected the error. After the county committees entered the city, in order to build housing for the committees, from early February to the end of March for two months, the county party committee, county government, public security bureau, armed forces department, industry and commerce bureau, post office and other committees and the suburban district, in addition to hiring 954 carpenters and 239 bricklayers and tilers, they also illegally mobilized 60 carts (for pulling bricks, earth, and wood, equivalent to 180 laborers) and 1,015 laborers. After review, the county committee believes that this is an unorganized and undisciplined bureaucratic behavior. Various committees, in order to live in good houses, disregarded the suffering and burden of the masses, and even destroyed the masses' production. Some committees even demolished bricks and wood from public houses to build housing. The county committee believes that it should take responsibility for the above errors, because after discovering this problem, the county committee did not seriously and resolutely stop it (the county committee机关 had already repaired the house with laborers, fearing that stopping it would cause dissatisfaction among other committees), resulting in such a bad outcome. A profound review was conducted at the county committee meeting. In addition to reporting to the district committee, it was decided: 1. Immediately stop mobilizing laborers to build houses; 2. Each committee should conduct a deep review and reflection on the above errors. (Qixin)

　　霸县县委坚持原则
  　制止非法动用民工
  　检讨机关盖房用民工的错误
    【冀中讯】霸县各机关严重浪费民力，县委已检讨纠正。县各机关进城后，为修建机关住所，县委、县政府、公安局、武装部、工商局、邮局等机关和城厢区自二月初到三月底两个月以来，除雇佣木匠九百五十四个工、瓦匠二百三十九个工以外，还非法动员了大车六十辆（拉砖、土、木料，折合工一百八十个），民夫一千零十五个工。经过检讨，县委认为：这是无组织、无纪律的官僚主义的行为。各机关为住好房，不顾群众疾苦和负担，更不惜破坏群众生产，更有的机关拆毁公共房屋的砖和木料，修建住所。以上错误县委认为应负责任，因为发觉此问题后，县委没有认真坚决的制止（县委机关已用民夫把房修理好，怕制止引起其他机关的不满），以致造成此种恶果。县委会上作了深刻检讨，除报地委外，并决定：一、立即停止动员民工修建房所；二、各机关对以上错误要深刻检讨与反省。　　　（齐心）
