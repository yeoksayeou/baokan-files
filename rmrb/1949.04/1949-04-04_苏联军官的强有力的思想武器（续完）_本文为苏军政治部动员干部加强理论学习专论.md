　　To master Marxist-Leninist theory, every officer must profoundly study the "History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks) Short Course," must study the works of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, first of all the "Communist Manifesto" by Marx and Engels, must study Lenin's "What Is to Be Done?", "One Step Forward, Two Steps Back," "Two Tactics of Social-Democracy in the Democratic Revolutio," "Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism," and other works, and must study Stalin's "Foundations of Leninism," "Problems of Leninism," "Concerning the Problems of Agrarian Policy in the U.S.S.R.," "Report on the Work of the Central Committee to the Eighteenth Congress of the C.P.S.U.(B.)," "On the Great Patriotic War of the Soviet Union," and other works.

　　Studying the classical works of Marx and Lenin enriches us with the revolutionary struggle experience of laborers seeking liberation. Studying Marxist-Leninist classical works equips us with the knowledge of social development laws and establishes an unshakable belief in the inevitable victory of communism. After studying the thoughts of the great leaders of the working class and the creators of scientific communism, we can deeply understand the truly decisive role played by the revolutionary Marxist-Leninist party, as the vanguard and political leader of the working class, in the struggle for the full realization of a communist society.

　　Studying Marxism-Leninism can further enhance our officers' Soviet patriotism, raise the self-esteem of Soviet soldiers, further enhance political vigilance, and make them more loyal to their military duties. It can help in adhering to the military oath and regulations.

　　Many facts show that officers of the Soviet armed forces are studying the history and theory of the Leninist-Stalinist party with the utmost determination and interest. After training Soviet officers in the Marxist-Leninist system, these officers have continuously improved their ideological and theoretical level. The number of students in Marxist-Leninist night schools and study groups on the history of the Communist Party is increasing rapidly. Many officers are studying in military academies and military research classes. Independently studying theoretical books has become the most important and widespread method for intellectuals and cadres in the army. The effect of officers' political study is well demonstrated in improving the quality of combat training in the army and consolidating army discipline.

　　The summary election party meetings and party congresses held at the beginning of this year are of great significance for further improving the ideological and political work of army cadres. These meetings helped our political organs to point out many shortcomings of officers in political study and adopted plans to correct and eliminate these shortcomings.

　　The achievement in the Marxist-Leninist education of officers is reflected in the fact that the vast majority of officers know that mastering Bolshevik theory is of great significance for correctly understanding the policies of the Party and the Soviet state and for understanding the important tasks undertaken by the Soviet armed forces in each period. That is to say, most of our officers have a good grasp of the truth that without the necessary ideological weapons, without the constant work of studying Marxism-Leninism, it is impossible to correctly solve the tasks of building and consolidating the army in the Soviet Union.

　　However, there are still some incorrect ideas that there are no backward people among our officers who do not want to improve their ideological level. This intolerable fact that some officers take an indifferent attitude towards their ideological progress still exists. Some of our officers have not drawn the necessary conclusions from the resolution of the Central Committee of the Communist Party on strengthening ideological work. We should not adopt a liberal attitude of turning a blind eye to these people.

　　Officer Vasilyevsky said in his speech: "I have never engaged in the study of Marxist-Leninist theory, let all these things be studied by my political assistant!" Aren't people who say this bureaucratic? Aren't they people who have lost interest in ideological and theoretical work? Isn't this forgetting the important responsibilities of officers in the Soviet armed forces? Comrade Vasilyevsky, who lags behind in political development and does not study policy development, will eventually become a bureaucrat who cannot see the future development of our cause.

　　Officer Vichkov is also infected with the disease that Vasilyevsky suffers from. At the party meeting, we justly criticized his attitude of neglecting political study. We denounced his contempt for studying Marxist-Leninist theory and his indifference to the study of his subordinates. However, Comrade Vichkov did not draw the conclusions he should have drawn from the criticism and did not take any measures to overcome his political backwardness and organize his subordinates to study.

　　If the head of a unit is indifferent to the ideological development of his subordinates, has no interest in the political training of the unit, and does not take any measures for his subordinates to study the theory and history of the Party, then this head does not understand his tasks.

　　The Party entrusted the important task of organizing the political education of military cadres to the political workers in the army, but some political workers have adopted an indifferent and nonchalant attitude towards this work. In some units (where the propaganda work is led by Comrade Pirogov), the majority of officers in the unit do not participate in Marxist-Leninist study. What else can explain this phenomenon except the lack of Bolshevik concern for the political education of officers and the lack of guarantees? Some of our officers do not participate in study for two months, or even several months. But in the face of this reality, no one feels surprised. The workers of our political organs should regard leading officers in Marxist-Leninist study as their constant and continuous work.

　　There are still many shortcomings in our propaganda of Marxism-Leninism. In some units, ideological propaganda work is still divorced from military training tasks, from consolidating army discipline, and from the political and ideological situation of the army.

　　Our Party has repeatedly educated Party members not to become bookworms and dogmatists. To be proficient in Marxism-Leninism means to learn and grasp the essence of Marxist-Leninist theory and to learn to use this theory to solve practical problems. If this is applied to the life of the navy and army, it means that political training should play a guiding role, so that the military training of the army improves in quality, so that soldiers can better carry out their duties, and so that military discipline, army order, and organization are more consolidated.

　　In some units and corps, the habit that the Party has pointed out, that political workers and Party organizations do not interfere with the ideological and theoretical self-study of cadres, has not been eliminated. The lack of Party inspection is bound to lead to the formation of a situation in which some officers are only formally engaged in self-study, but in fact they have not improved their ideological level for a long time.

　　The task of political workers and Party organizations is to constantly lead the work of officers' political education and help them to work independently. Raise them so that they can carry out a Bolshevik and tenacious struggle against all kinds of phenomena that do not pay attention to the study of Marxist-Leninist theory. Implement strict supervision and inspection of political training work in various forms and methods.

　　According to the instructions of the Director of the General Political Department of the Soviet Armed Forces, a check on the Marxist-Leninist training of officers will be held from November 1st to 30th this year.

　　This is the first check on the political training of officers in the post-war period. The General Political Department of the Soviet Armed Forces calls on all political organs and Party organizations to carefully prepare for this check in all aspects. Before the check is carried out, special attention should be paid to studying the history of the Communist Party after the October Revolution, the Bolshevik Party on the eve of the Great Patriotic War, and the Bolshevik Party that struggled to restore and further develop the national economy after the Great Patriotic War. Before the check begins, the officers should carefully study all domestic and foreign policy issues of the Bolshevik Party and the Soviet government, as well as international situation issues.

　　In order to more deeply study the history and theory of the Bolshevik Party, and to more deeply study the domestic and foreign policies of the Party and the government, Soviet commanders and heads of political work should make more effective use of the summer time. Some leaders often relax their attention to improving the ideological and theoretical level of soldiers during the summer period. They have an incorrect idea that political training work can only be truly carried out in autumn and winter. We should resolutely eliminate this phenomenon. The study of Marxism-Leninism should not be seasonal. Whether it is winter or summer, we should strive to continuously improve the ideological and political education of Soviet soldiers.

　　Commanders and heads of political organs should cooperate with this check to better help our officers conduct Marxist-Leninist self-study. It is necessary to frequently organize content-rich and ideological lecture meetings for officers in order to help them more deeply study the history and theory of our Party. Discussions and individual seminars should be held, in which the officers are given explanations on the issues they are interested in. Help them to consolidate the knowledge they have gained in the process of studying Marxism-Leninism. Meetings, reports and lectures with political themes should be held systematically for the officers.

　　The heads of political organs and Party organizations should make multi-faceted preparations for this study of Marxism-Leninism by officers. Use all means to further improve the ideological and political education of officers. Mobilize them to improve the political training of various corps, units, and fleets. Consolidate military discipline, strengthen the political emotions of each member, and complete the political training and education work of the unit.

　　The thoughts of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, as eternal as the sun and moon, inspire our people to achieve victories in the era of the Great October Revolution, in the era of struggle against foreign armed intervention and domestic counter-revolution, and in the era of socialist construction. Their thoughts inspired the Soviet people and their army to defend the motherland and crush the enemy in the years of the Great Patriotic War of the Soviet Union. Now, their thoughts are inspiring the working people of the Soviet Union to achieve the glorious victory of communist construction, and are inspiring the soldiers of the Soviet Armed Forces to serve the motherland with infinite loyalty and to fulfill their military tasks in an exemplary manner, so as to be ready at any time and under all conditions to defend the interests and honor of the socialist country at all costs.

　　苏联军官的强有力的思想武器（续完）
    本文为苏军政治部动员干部加强理论学习专论
    叶群译
    每个军官要通晓马列主义理论，就必须深刻地研究“联共党史简明教程”，必须要研究马、恩、列、斯的著作，首先就是马克思、恩格斯的“共产党宣言”，必须要研究列宁的“做什么？”、“进一步退两步”、“社会民主党在民主革命中的两个策略”、“帝国主义是资本主义发展的最高阶段”等作品，要研究斯大林的“关于列宁主义的基础”、“关于列宁主义的问题”、“关于苏联土地政策问题”、“在第十八次代表大会上关于联共中央工作的总结报告”、“论伟大苏联卫国战争”等作品。
    研究马克思、列宁古典著作，就能够以劳动者谋取解放的革命斗争经验来丰富自己，研究马列主义古典著作能用社会发展规律的知识来武装自己，和建立对共产主义必然胜利的不可动摇的信念。研究了劳动者伟大领袖和科学共产主义创造者的思想之后，我们就能深刻地领会作为工人阶级先锋队和政治领袖的革命的马列主义政党，在为共产主义社会的全部实现而进行的斗争里，是起着怎样真实的决定作用。
    研究马列主义能更加提高我们军官的苏维埃爱国主义情绪。提高苏联军人的自尊心。能更加提高政治警惕性。使他们更忠实于自己的军事职务。能够帮助军队的誓约和规则。
    许多事实都说明了，苏维埃武装部队的军官们，都在以最大的决心和兴趣，来研究列宁、斯大林党的历史和理论，以马列主义的体系来训练苏联军官之后，这些军官就不断的提高了自己的思想理论水准。马列主义夜校和联共党史研究组学生的数目在激增着，不少的军官都在军事学院和军事研究班学习着，独立研究理论书籍已成为部队知识分子干部的最主要的和最普遍的方法。在提高部队战斗训练的质量方面和巩固军队纪律方面，都很好的表现出军官政治学习的效果来。
    今年年初所举行的总结选举的党的会议及党的代表大会，对进一步改善军队干部政治思想的工作，有很大的意义。这些会议帮助我们的政治机关，指出了很多军官在政治学习方面的缺点，并通过了改正肃清这些缺点的方案。
    军官马列主义教育的成绩表现在绝大多数的军官都知道了：通晓布尔什维克理论，对于正确了解党和苏维埃国家的政策，对于了解每个时期苏联武装部队所担负着的重大任务具有很大的意义。也就是说，我们的大多数军官，已经很好地掌握了这一真理——即没有必要的思想武器，没有学习马列主义的经常工作，在苏联正确的解决建设部队和巩固部队的任务是不可能的。
    然而也还有一些不正确的想法，认为在我们军官中已经没有落后的，不想提高自己思想水准的人。某些军官对自己的思想进步采取毫不关心的态度，这种令人不能容忍的事实至今还存在着。我们的军官中还有一些人，没有从联共中央关于加强思想工作的决议里，做出必要的结论来。对于这种人我们不应采取熟视无睹的自由主义态度。
    军官华西里克夫斯基发言中曾说：“我从来都不从事马列主义理论的研究，让这些事统统归我的政治助手去研究吧！”这样说的人难道还不是事务主义者？还不是对思想理论工作失去兴趣的人？这样说法难道还不是忘记了苏联武装部队中军官的重要责任吗？落在政治发展后面和不研究政策发展的华西里克夫斯基同志，最终将变成看不见我们事业发展前途的事务主义者。
    军官维赤可夫同样也传染上了华西里克夫斯基所害的病。在党的会议上我们已公正的批评了他这种轻视政治学习的态度。已指斥了他鄙弃研究马列主义理论和对部下学习漠不关心的态度。然而维赤可夫同志并没有从批评中得出应有的结论来，没有采取任何克服自己政治落后和组织部下学习的办法。
    部队首长，如果对部下思想发展漠不关心，对部队政治训练工作毫无兴趣，对部下研究党的理论和历史不采取任何办法，那么这个首长就是不懂得自己任务的首长。
    党把组织军事干部政治教育的重任，委托给部队的政治工作者，然而有些政治工作人员却对这种工作采取着漠不关心和满不在乎的态度。在有些部队里（那里的宣传工作是由彼罗果夫同志领导的）参加马列主义学习的不是该部的大多数军官，象这种现象如果不用对军官政治教育缺乏布尔什维克的关心和没有保证来解释外，还能用什么来解释呢？我们有些军官竟有两个月，甚至好几个月不参加学习的。但面对着这种实际情况，却没有任何人感觉到惊奇。我们的政治机关的工作者应当把领导军官们进行马列主义学习，做为自己的经常不断的工作。
    我们在宣传马列主义方面还存在很多缺点，在有些部队里，思想宣传工作还有与军训任务，与巩固部队纪律及部队政治思想状况相脱节的现象。
    我们党曾屡次教育党员们，不要变成书呆子和教条主义者。精通马列主义——就是说要学习掌握马列主义理论的精神实质，并学会用这个理论去解决实际问题，如果把这一点适用于海陆军的生活方面来说那就是说政治训练应当起指导作用，使得部队的军训提高质量，使得军人更好地进行自己的业务，使得军事纪律，部队的秩序和组织更加巩固。
    某些部队和兵团里至今还没有去掉党所指出的政治工作人员和党的组织对干部思想、理论的自我学习采取不干涉政策的习惯。缺乏党的检查，势必要形成某些军官仅仅是形式上算是从事了自我学习，实际上他们很久以来就没有提高自己的思想水准了。
    政治工作人员和党的组织的任务在于经常领导军官政治教育的工作，帮助他们独立进行工作。提高他们，使他们对不注意学习马列主义理论的各种现象进行布尔什维克的顽强的斗争。对各种形式和方法下进行的政治训练工作，实行严密的监督和检查。
    根据苏联武装部队总政治部主任的指示，今年十一月一号到三十号将对军官马列主义训练举行一次检查。
    这是战后期间军官政治训练的第一次检查，苏联武装部队总政治部号召一切政治机关和党的组织，细心地从各个方面来准备这个检查，在检查进行以前要特别注意，研究联共党十月革命以后这一阶段的历史，其次是伟大卫国战争前夜的布尔什维克党，伟大卫国战争之后为恢复和进一步发展国民经济而斗争的布尔什维克党。在检查开始以前应当和军官们一起，仔细研究布尔什维克党及苏联政府一切对内对外政策问题，以及国际形势问题。
    为了更深刻的研究布尔什维克党的历史和理论，更深刻的研究党和政府的对内对外政策，苏联的指挥官和负责政治工作的首长，应当更有效的利用夏季的时间。有些领导者常常在夏季的期间内，对提高军人思想理论水准放松注意，他们有一种不正确的想法，认为只有秋季和冬季才能真正进行政治训练工作，我们应当坚决的肃清这种现象。马列主义的学习是不应当有季候性的。无论是冬季，无论是夏季，都应当争取不断的提高苏维埃军人的思想政治教育。
    指挥官和政治机关的首长们，应当配合这次检查，更好地帮助我们军官进行马列主义自我学习。必须经常为军官们组织内容充实和有思想的演讲会，以便帮助他们更深刻地研究我们党的历史和理论。应当举行讨论会和个别座谈，在这些会上给军官们解释，他们有兴趣的问题。帮助他们使他们在学习马列主义过程中所得到的知识更加巩固，应当有系统的给军官们举行座谈会，有政治主题的报告和讲演。
    政治机关和党组织的首长们，应当对这次军官马列主义学习进行多方的准备工作。用一切办法使军官思想政治教育更加提高。动员他们提高各兵团、各部队、各舰队的政治训练。巩固军事纪律，坚定每一成员的政治情绪和完成部队政治训练和教育工作。
    如日月常存的马——恩——列——斯的思想鼓舞着，我们人民，使他们在伟大十月革命时代，在同外国武装干涉和国内反革命斗争的时代，在社会主义建设时代都取得了胜利，他们的思想鼓舞了苏维埃人民及其军队在伟大苏联卫国战争的年代里，保卫了祖国和粉碎了敌人。现在，他们的思想正在鼓舞着苏联的劳动人民去取得共产主义建设的光荣胜利，鼓舞着苏联武装部队的军人，——无限忠心的服务祖国，模范的完成自己的军事任务。以便随时，和在一切条件下准备好不惜任何代价，去保卫社会主义国家的利益和荣誉。
