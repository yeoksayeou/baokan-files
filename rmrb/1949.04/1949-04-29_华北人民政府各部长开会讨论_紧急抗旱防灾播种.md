　　North China People's Government Ministers Meet to Discuss
　　Emergency Drought Resistance, Disaster Prevention, and Planting
　　[This Newspaper's Dispatch] The North China People's Government convened a joint office meeting of all ministers on the 27th to specifically discuss drought resistance, disaster prevention, and planting issues. After Deputy Minister Zhang Chong of the Ministry of Agriculture reported on the prolonged drought situation in various parts of North China, he pointed out that it is now the planting season, and it is urgent to mobilize the masses to carry out drought resistance and disaster prevention so as not to delay the planting work. He also cited the example of Chahar Province, which has continuously planted for four years without delaying the planting season, as a model for other regions to learn from. In order to prevent drought disasters, the meeting proposed vigorously manufacturing waterwheels and organizing the masses to promote the purchase of waterwheels. Everyone also discussed the pest problems in some areas, saying that the occurrence of pests is mainly due to the lack of snow last winter, but various places have been trying to eliminate them at any time. Vice Chairman Yang Xiufeng emphasized that sowing, drought resistance, and disaster prevention must be regarded as current urgent tasks. In terms of planting, we should make full use of water power for planting, and the most important method is to organize the masses to work together. Vice Chairman Yang finally pointed out: We must sound the alarm and pay attention to this current major issue, and we must do our best to solve it.

　　华北人民政府各部长开会讨论
  　紧急抗旱防灾播种
    【本报讯】华北人民政府于二十七日召开各部长联席办公会议，专门讨论了抗旱防灾与播种问题。农业部张冲副部长报告了华北各地久旱未雨的情形后，提出目前已值播种时节，急须发动群众，进行抗旱防灾，不使耽误播种工作。他并举察哈尔省连续点种四年，作到了没耽误播种季节的例子，可资各地借镜。为防止旱灾，会上提出大力制造水车，组织群众推销购买水车的意见。大家又谈到有些地区的虫害问题，都说：虫害发生主要是因去冬没雪，但各地已随时设法扑灭。杨秀峰副主席着重指出，下种抗旱防灾，必须视为当前的紧急任务。在播种方面则应尽量发挥水力进行点种，最主要的方法是组织群众协力去作。杨副主席最后指出：我们要敲起警钟来，注意这一当前的重大问题，一定要尽力解决它。
