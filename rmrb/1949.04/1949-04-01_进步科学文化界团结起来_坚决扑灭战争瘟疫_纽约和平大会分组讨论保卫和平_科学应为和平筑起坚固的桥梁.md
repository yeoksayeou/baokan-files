Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 30th: TASS reports: The New York Scientific and Cultural Conference for World Peace held its first plenary session on the 26th. On the 27th, group meetings were held, and each group enthusiastically discussed the role of science and culture in striving for peace.

　　The Natural Sciences Group meeting was chaired by American physicist Philip Morrison. Wallace and Alexander Oparin, a member of the Soviet Academy of Sciences, participated in the group's work. Indian mathematician Sambi gave an impassioned speech, declaring his support for the progressive forces that defend peace. He spoke of millions of Indians dying of hunger, while in the United States, large amounts of food are destroyed or used to feed livestock. Leber of Colorado, an astronomer, said: Science should build a solid bridge for peace. Next, Wallace spoke. Wallace is not only the leader of the Progressive Party, but also a famous agronomist and breeder. Wallace urged scientists around the world to cooperate to achieve peace, and exposed the intention of the American reactionaries to suppress the American people and militarize the country. Wallace also condemned racial superiority. The six hundred people who participated in this group meeting were extremely interested in the speech by Oparin, a member of the Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union and a biologist. Oparin said: Hundreds of millions of people do not want war. Democracy in science is the greatest guarantee that science will serve the interests of mankind. Oparin said: True scientists cannot be indifferent to how and for what purpose their achievements are used. His conscience does not allow him to stand idly by while his achievements are used to exterminate innocent people. Oparin said: From the first day of its establishment, the Soviet Union has adopted a policy of democratizing science, consciously and systematically absorbing the broad masses of working people to participate in scientific activities. In our country, science is truly the science of the people, and most of the young Soviet scientists come from the people. The Soviet Union is a bastion of democracy and peace. Soviet scientists are united in their desire to strive for peace and oppose war provocateurs. We extend a friendly hand to American progressive scientists and scientists around the world, hoping that they will strive for full understanding and cooperation with each other. All countries in the world are eager for peace. Let us unite our strength and use the power of science to oppose the agitators of a new world war.

    纽约和平大会分组讨论保卫和平　科学应为和平筑起坚固的桥梁
    【新华社北平三十日电】塔斯社讯：纽约科学与文化界保卫世界和平大会，于二十六日举行首次全体会议后，二十七日即分组举行会议，各组热烈地讨论了科学与文化在争取和平中的作用。
    自然科学组会议由美国物理学家菲立普·莫里主持。华莱士与苏联科学院会员亚历山大·奥巴林参加了该组的工作。印度数学家萨姆毕发表激昂演说，声明他拥护维护和平的进步力量。他讲到千百万印度人民因饥饿而死亡，而在美国却有大量粮食被毁掉或用来喂牲畜。科罗拉多州的天文学家乐伯慈说：科学应为和平筑起坚固的桥梁。接着，华莱士说话，华莱士不仅是进步党领袖，而且也是著名的农学家和选种学家。华莱士敦促全世界科学家合作以获取和平，并揭露美国反动派镇压美国人民和使国家军国主义化的意图。华莱士并斥责种族优越论。参加这一组会议的六百人，对于苏联生物学家科学院会员奥巴林的演讲极感兴趣。奥巴林谈：亿万人民不愿意战争。科学中的民主是使科学为人类利益服务的最大的保证。奥巴林说：真正的科学家对于怎么利用与为了什么目的而利用它的成就，不能漠不关心。他的良心不允许漠然旁观其成就被用来灭绝无辜的人民。奥巴林说：苏联自从成立的第一日起，即采取科学民主化的政策，自觉而计划地吸收广大劳动人民参加科学活动。在我们国家里，科学是真正人民的科学，大部苏联青年科学家是来自人民当中。苏联是民主与和平的堡垒，苏联科学家都团结在争取和平，反对战争挑拨者的愿望之中，我们向美国进步科学家与全世界科学家伸出友谊之手，希望他们力求相互之间充分的了解与合作。世界各国都在渴望和平，让我们团结我们的力量，利用科学的威力，以反对新世界大战的煽动者。
