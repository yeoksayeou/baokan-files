Xinhua News Agency, Yangtze River Front, 2:00 AM, 22nd: The heroic People's Liberation Army had approximately 300,000 troops cross the Yangtze River on the 21st. The crossing battle began at midnight on the 20th, between Wuhu and Anqing. The Yangtze River defense line, built by the Kuomintang reactionaries for three and a half months, was like a house of cards before the People's Liberation Army. The enemy troops lacked the will to fight and collapsed in disarray. The Yangtze River was calm, and our army launched ten thousand ships simultaneously, heading straight for the opposite bank. In less than 24 hours, 300,000 People's Liberation Army troops had broken through the enemy lines, occupied a vast area on the south bank, and are now advancing towards the cities of Fanchang, Tongling, Qingyang, Digang, Lugang. The People's Liberation Army is resolutely executing Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu's orders with their heroic fighting.

　　大军卅万昨日渡过长江
    【新华社长江前线二十二日二时电】英勇的人民解放军二十一日已有大约三十万人渡过长江。渡江战斗于二十日午夜开始，地点在芜湖、安庆之间，国民党反动派经营了三个半月的长江防线，遇着人民解放军好似摧枯拉朽，军无斗志，纷纷溃退。长江风平浪静，我军万船齐发，直取对岸，不到二十四小时，三十万人民解放军即已突破敌阵，占领南岸广大地区，现正向繁昌、铜陵、青阳、荻港、鲁港诸城进击中，人民解放军正以自己的英雄式的战斗，坚决地执行毛主席朱总司令的命令。
