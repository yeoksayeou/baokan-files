　　To Solve the Difficulty of Labor and Animal Power Shortages
    Restrictions on the Use of Civilian Labor During Spring Plowing
  　Order Issued by the North China People's Government and Military Region for Implementation
    [Reported by Our Newspaper] In order to vigorously carry out the spring plowing campaign, increase production to ensure military and civilian food supplies, the North China People's Government and the North China Military Region jointly issued an order on April 16th, instructing all levels of logistics headquarters, all army corps headquarters, all administrative offices, provincial and municipal governments, and all departments and directly subordinate institutions and schools of the North China Government, to restrict the mobilization of civilian labor during the spring plowing period to solve the difficulty of labor and animal power shortages, and formulated the following measures:
    (1) During the spring plowing period, the mobilization of civilian labor is limited to the following scope: First, except for stretchers and civilian laborers necessary for combat and the transportation of firearms, ammunition, grain, clothing, medicine, etc. for the front lines, all other services shall be suspended. Second, the transfer of wounded and sick soldiers and disabled veterans who cannot walk along the way should save civilian labor as much as possible. Any wastefulness should be punished and announced in the newspaper. Third, except for military hospitals, veterans' schools, and field armies, any organs or troops that consume grain within 30 li must transport it themselves, and the remains of martyrs will not be transported. Other items such as clothing, electric poles, wires, magnetic heads, paints, and military industrial equipment and transportation equipment will be suspended unless there is an urgent need and special permission is granted by the North China Logistics Department and the secondary military region logistics department. Fourth, except for necessary plowing on behalf of military dependents and families of martyrs, the reception of the southbound army, and the land exchange plowing of militia and civilian laborers participating in the war, all miscellaneous duties in the village must be absolutely stopped. Fifth, the progress of approved water conservancy, transportation, and civil engineering projects must be coordinated with the local government to ensure that civilian laborers do not miss the time for sowing, hoeing, and harvesting wheat. If necessary, civilian labor can be hired.
    (2) During the spring plowing period, when any organ, group, or troop uses civilian labor, except for wounded and sick soldiers and disabled veterans who cannot walk along the way, it must be signed and sealed by the heads of the political departments at or above the column (army) or secondary military region level, and introduced for approval by the North China or secondary military region logistics department. The front must be approved by the Joint Logistics Department.
    (3) During the spring plowing period, no matter which department or individual mobilizes civilian labor without following these measures or prescribed procedures, the district and village-level governments should strictly refuse. Those who engage in coercion or threats will have government and civilian personnel sent to the government for handling, and soldiers will be sent to nearby troop political organs for handling.
    (4) The start and end dates of the spring plowing period shall be determined and announced by the logistics departments of each district in consultation with the administrative offices and provincial and municipal governments.
    During the spring plowing period, the use of civilian labor must be carefully calculated to achieve less mobilization and rapid demobilization, overcome any waste of civilian labor, and call on and organize civilian laborers who are on expeditions or performing tasks outside to help with spring plowing locally to increase production. It is hoped that the above points will be communicated to your subordinates for resolute implementation!

    （一）春耕时期动员民力只限制下列范围：一、除作战必要用之担架民工及供应前方的枪械、弹药、粮秣、被服、医药等运输外，其他勤务一律停止。二、沿途转送部队伤病员及不能行走之荣军，均应尽量节省民力，如有浪费情事，应予处分并登报公布。三、除军医院荣校野战军外，任何机关部队吃粮在三十里以内者均须自运，烈士灵柩停运。其他如被服、电杆、电线、磁头、颜料及军工器材交通器材除有急需，经华北后司及二级军区后司特准外，一律停运。四、除为军工烈属必要之代耕，南下大军之招待及参战民兵民工之土地变工耕种外，一切村中杂差均绝对停止。五、业已批准之水利交通土木等工程之进行，必须和当地政府配合，保证民工不误下种锄苗收麦的时间，必要时可采取雇佣民力办法。
    （二）春耕期间，任何机关团体部队动用民力时，除沿途伤病员及不能行走之荣军外，均须由纵队（军）或二级军区以上政治部门首长负责签名盖章，介绍经华北或二级军区后司批准，前方须经联勤批准。
