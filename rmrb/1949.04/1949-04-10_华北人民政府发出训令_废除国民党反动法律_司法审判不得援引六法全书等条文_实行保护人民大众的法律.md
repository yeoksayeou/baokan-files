　　Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, April 8th: The North China People's Government issued Law Enforcement Order No. 8 on April 1st, deciding to abolish the "Six Codes" and all reactionary laws of the Kuomintang reactionary traitorous government. The order stated: It is hereby decided to abolish the Kuomintang's Six Codes and all its reactionary laws. Judicial trials at all levels of the People's Government must no longer invoke its provisions. The order pointed out: The Kuomintang's laws were designed to protect the rule of the feudal landlords, comprador, and bureaucratic bourgeoisie, and to suppress the resistance of the broad masses of the people. They were shackles imposed on the broad working people by the Kuomintang reactionaries. Therefore, the Kuomintang's reactionary laws must be thoroughly and completely abolished, and these shackles must be completely smashed. The order pointed out: The laws that the people want are those that protect the rule of the people and suppress the resistance of the feudal landlords, comprador, and bureaucratic bourgeoisie. This is fundamentally different from the Kuomintang's reactionary laws. The order stated: "The people's laws already have a considerable period of ruling experience in the liberated areas. Some have already been studied and written into the various programs, laws, regulations, orders, and resolutions issued by the People's Government and the People's Liberation Army; others are being created. When handling cases, judicial organs at all levels should follow the provisions of programs, regulations, orders, and resolutions if there are any. If there are no provisions, they should be handled in accordance with the policies of New Democracy. It should be affirmed that the content of the people's laws is more civilized and richer than the laws of any ruler in the old era, and it only needs to be sorted out to be perfected." The order called on: "People's governments at all levels, especially judicial workers, should treat the Kuomintang's Six Codes and all anti-people laws of European, American, and Japanese capitalist countries with contempt and criticism. Use all your energy to study the Marxist-Leninist view of the state and law, study the policies, programs, laws, orders, regulations, and resolutions of New Democracy, and collect and study the ruling experience of the people themselves to create new and more complete laws."

　　华北人民政府发出训令
  　废除国民党反动法律
    司法审判不得援引六法全书等条文
  　实行保护人民大众的法律
    【新华社北平八日电】华北人民政府四月一日发出法行字第八号训令，决定废除国民党反动卖国政府的“六法全书”及其一切反动法律。训令内称：兹决定废除国民党的六法全书及其一切反动法律。各级人民政府的司法审判，不得再援引其条文。训令指出：国民党的法律是为了保护封建地主、买办、官僚资产阶级的统治与镇压广大人民的反抗，是国民党反动派套在广大劳动人民头上的枷锁。因此，要彻底地全部废除国民党反动的法律，把这个枷锁彻底打破。训令指出：人民所要的法律，是为了保护人民大众的统治与镇压封建地主、买办、官僚资产阶级的反抗。这与国民党的反动法律本质上不同。训令称：“人民的法律，已有了解放区人民相当长期的统治经验，有的已经研究好，写在人民政府、人民解放军发布的各种纲领、法律、条例、命令、决议等规定里；有的正在创造。各级司法机关办案，有纲领、条例、命令、决议等规定的从规定。没有规定的，照新民主主义的政策办理。应该肯定人民法律的内容，比任何旧时代统治者的法律，要文明与丰富，只需加以整理，即可臻于完备。”调令号召：“各级人民政府，特别是司法工作者，要以蔑视与批判的态度对待国民党六法全书及欧美日本资本主义国家一切反人民的法律。用全副精神来学习马克思列宁主义的国家观、法律观、学习新民主主义的政策、纲领、法律、命令、条例、决议，来搜集与研究人民自己的统治经验，制作出新的较完备的法律来。”
