Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, 23rd: Moscow Dispatch: Kuznetsov, Chairman of the Central Committee of Soviet Trade Unions, delivered a report on the work of the Central Committee of Soviet Trade Unions at the Tenth Congress of Soviet Trade Unions on the 19th. Kuznetsov pointed out that the Soviet working class has created brilliant achievements in the period of peaceful construction, the Great Patriotic War, and the post-war recovery and development. Now, socialist emulation includes more than 90% of all workers, engineers, technicians, and staff. As early as 1948, more than two thousand enterprises had completed their Five-Year Plans. Every quarter, more than a thousand red banner pennants and a large number of prizes are awarded to the winners in the competition.

In his report, Kuznetsov mentioned the collective contracts signed by the trade unions and factories, which are of great importance in helping to complete and exceed plans and in improving the material welfare of employees. Regarding the wage issue, he said that in the Soviet Union, wages are strictly calculated according to the socialist principle of "remuneration according to the quantity and quality of labor." On the basis of increased labor productivity, wages in various sectors of the national economy are gradually increasing. The state labor protection expenditure stipulated in the post-war Five-Year Plan is four times greater than the total labor protection expenditure stipulated in the first two pre-war Five-Year Plans. The state's expenditure on disease relief, maternity leave, free education, and free medical care has increased the real wages of workers by more than one-third. In addition, as a result of the abolition of the rationing system, the reduction of consumer goods prices, and the implementation of currency reform, the real wages of workers in 1948 increased by double that of 1947. As a result of another price reduction on March 1 this year, real wages have increased again. Kuznetsov spoke about the international activities of the Soviet Trade Unions. He said that the Soviet Trade Unions, along with other democratic trade unions, played a leading role in the establishment of the World Federation of Trade Unions in 1945. The World Federation of Trade Unions has now become a genuine organization of workers all over the world, and the plans of the right-wing leaders of British and American trade unions to abolish the World Federation of Trade Unions have failed. The task of the Soviet Trade Unions is to continue to expand friendly ties with foreign trade unions in every possible way, to strengthen international worker solidarity, and to strive for lasting peace.

　　苏联工人的辉煌成就
  　库兹涅佐夫报告苏职工会中委会工作
    【新华社北平二十三日电】莫斯科讯：苏联职工会中央委员会主席库兹涅佐夫十九日在苏联职工会第十届代表大会上作了关于苏联职工会中央委员会工作的报告。库兹涅佐夫指出：在和平建设时期、伟大爱国战争时期及战后恢复与发展时期，苏联工人阶级都创立了辉煌的成就。现在社会主义竞赛已包括了全部工人、工程师、技师和职员的百分之九十以上。还在一九四八年的时候，就已经有两千多个企业完成了五年计划。每一季都有一千多个红旗锦标和大量奖品拨给竞赛中的优胜者。
    库兹涅佐夫在报告中提到职工会和厂方所订的集体合同，在帮助完成并超过计划方面，和增进职工的物质福利方面，有很大的重要性。关于工资问题，他说：在苏联、工资是严格的依照“按劳动的量与质给酬”的社会主义原则来计算的。在劳动率提高的基础上，国民经济各部门的工资正在逐步提高中。战后五年计划所规定的国家劳动保护费，比战前头两个五年计划所规定的劳动保护费的总和大四倍，国家在疾病救济，孕妇休假、免费教育、免费医疗等方面所付的经费，使工人的实际工资增加了三分之一以上。加以取消配给制、减低消费品价格、实行货币改革的结果，工人们一九四八年的实际工资又比一九四七年增加了一倍，今年三月一日再一次减低物价的结果，实际工资又已增加了。库兹涅佐夫说到苏联职工会的国际活动。他说：在一九四五年成立世界工联时，苏联职工会和其他民主职工会一同起了领导作用。世界工联现在已经成为全世界工人的真正组织，英美职工会右翼首领企图取消世界工联的计划都落空了。苏联职工会的任务，就是以一切可能的方法继续扩大和外国职工会的友谊联系，以加强国际工人的团结，为争取持久和平而斗争。
