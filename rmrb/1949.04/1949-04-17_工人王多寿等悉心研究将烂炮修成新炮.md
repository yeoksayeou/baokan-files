　　Workers Wang Duoshou and others carefully researched
  　　and repaired broken cannons into new cannons
    [Ping City News] After liberation, the workers of the 70th Arsenal's Cannon Repair Department, through education, improved their awareness and worked hard to repair cannons for the liberation of the whole country. Cannons damaged by the Kuomintang were repaired into new cannons through workers' research and efforts. A certain type of mountain gun was originally unusable. The breechblock firing pin was dented by four millimeters. The gun barrel had the danger of explosion when firing. After research by workers Wang Duoshou, Zhang Lizeng, Shen Yushi, Han Zhongshen, Wu Maochun, Yuan Kejian, etc., the dented area was padded with steel plates, and it was completed in only half a day after welding and careful repair. A certain type of mountain gun was as useless as scrap iron, with too many missing parts. In the past, this gun would have been scrapped altogether. The workers believed that repairing one more gun meant one more strength, so workers Li Qinghai, Yang Hongyun, Lei Yin, and Li Hongting spent several days repairing and fitting it. In addition, a certain field gun had two breechblocks that were severely damaged, and the firing pin parts were all missing. After the foreman Xie Luquan and workers Chen Bingkui, Wang Deshu, Liu Junlan, and Lei Yizhi jointly researched and designed it, it took a week to repair it into a new breechblock. (Hu Guangzong)

　　工人王多寿等悉心研究
  　将烂炮修成新炮
    【平市讯】七十兵工厂修炮部在解放后，工人们经过教育，觉悟提高，努力为解放全国而赶修大炮。被国民党破坏的炮，经工人研究与努力，修成新炮。××式山炮，原已废不堪用，炮闩击针打火等处凹有四米厘。发射时炮身有爆炸危险。经工人王多寿、张立增、申毓实、韩重慎、吴茂椿、袁克俭等研究，将凹处用钢板垫上，经过烧焊与细修，只用了半日即告完成。××式山炮，已如废铁一般，缺少零件太多，在过去，这门炮根本就是报废，工人们认为多修一门炮即多一份力量，所以经工人李清海、杨鸿云、雷银、李宏庭用了几日修配而成。还有××野炮，炮闩两个已经破烂不堪，击针零件全没有，经领班谢鲁泉和工人陈炳魁、王德树、刘浚澜、雷宜志等共同研究与设计，用一星期的时间，修成新炮闩。（胡光宗）
