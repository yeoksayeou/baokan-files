　　Shijiazhuang News: The Shijiazhuang Trade Company invited the responsible persons of North China Industrial Company, Zhenhua Industrial Company, Jizhong Industrial Company, Trust Commercial Bank, Jinghua Commercial Bank, Hengda Company, New China Tobacco Company, Huafengxiang Flower Shop, Yangtze River Warehouse, etc. on the 26th of last month to hold a discussion based on the principle of concentrating the strength of public enterprises and strengthening the leadership of the market. This was the first meeting of its kind in Shijiazhuang. In the past, there was a lack of contact between each other, which caused the entire public enterprise to show a dispersed strength in the market, relaxing the struggle against speculative merchants. Everyone mentioned this in their speeches. For example, North China Industrial Company and Zhenhua Industrial Company had been deceived by speculative merchants many times due to lack of communication with their brother stores, and sold goods cheaply. Everyone believes that in the future, we must take consistent steps to unite around the state-owned trading company, exchange more information, and help each other. Liu Lifu of Jizhong Trading Company also proposed that: in addition to recognizing the importance of strengthening ties ideologically, it is more important to strengthen ties in specific business. In the end, everyone unanimously requested a common organization to facilitate strengthening ties and consolidating the economic position.

　　石市公营经济部门
  　提议建立联合组织
  　加强市场统一领导
    【石家庄讯】石市贸易公司于上月二十六日邀集华北实业公司、振华实业公司、冀中实业公司、信托商行、经华商行、恒大公司、新中国烟草公司、华丰祥花店、长江货栈等负责人，根据集中公营企业力量，加强对市场领导的方针进行座谈。在石家庄这样的会议还是第一次。过去，互相之间一向缺乏联系，使整个公营企业在市场上表现力量分散，放松了对投机商人的斗争。每个人发言都说到这一点，如华北实业公司、振华实业公司等因与兄弟商店不通气息多次受到投机商人的欺骗，把货物便宜卖出去了。大家认为今后必须采取一致步调团结在国营贸易公司的周围，多交换情况，互相帮助。冀中贸易公司刘力夫并提出：除了在思想上认识了加强连系之外，更重要的是在具体业务上加强联系。最后大家都一致要求有一个共同的组织，以便利加强联系，巩固经济阵地。
