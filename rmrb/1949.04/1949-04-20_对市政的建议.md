　　Suggestions for Municipal Administration
    Recently, this newspaper has received many positive suggestions from readers regarding municipal construction. We believe that these opinions are helpful to both the readers and the relevant authorities. We are now publishing excerpts, hoping to attract the attention of all relevant parties. -- Editor

    Saving Gasoline　The Liberation War requires a lot of gasoline, and our region is very short of gasoline. Therefore, saving gasoline is extremely important. However, currently, within our stationing departments, there are instances of wasting gasoline for personal matters. We believe there should be strict regulations.

    Repair Broken Telephones Quickly　The long-distance telephone line from Beijing to Mentougou has been out of service since the end of March due to a broken line. The telephone bureau does not respond when it will be repaired. Please pay attention to this matter from the relevant departments.

    Ban Iron-wheeled Carts from Traveling on Motor Roads　The motor road in Beijing has been damaged a lot due to the constant traffic of iron-wheeled carts. It is suggested that the competent department send someone to inspect and repair, and strictly prohibit iron-wheeled carts from passing.
    Liu Tingfan

    Outlaw Gamblers　Recently, a group of about ten people has been discovered on Wangfujing Street, colluding with each other, using playing cards to create mobile gambling scams, defrauding honest citizens and young people of their money, and resorting to beating and assault. There are also a few saboteurs tearing down street slogans and propaganda posters. We hope the city's public security organs will pay attention to cracking down on this.
    Zheng Yunda

    Establish Traffic Order　In order to establish traffic order, we would like to offer some suggestions for relevant parties to consider:
    1. There should be clear signs at tram stations, and passengers should wait for those getting off to disembark before boarding.
    2. It is forbidden to stand outside the tram door or behind the tram, and cyclists should not hold onto the tram or chase it, to avoid danger.
    3. Recently, tricycles have often not turned according to the road junction, but have directly rushed through; when parking, they are arbitrarily placed, some parked on the sidewalk, some parked at the entrance of the market (such as the west entrance of Dong'an Market), and the police do not intervene. Please pay attention to the Public Security Bureau.
    Xie Dadao

    Black Market Tickets Should Be Banned　Currently, there are black market tickets being sold at the East Railway Station outside Qianmen. Tickets for the express train to Tianjin cost 120 yuan and sell out an hour in advance, but there are many black market tickets near the square. The selling price is 180 yuan or 200 yuan. The masses have reacted very badly to this phenomenon. Is it related to those selling tickets inside the station? I think the relevant departments should thoroughly investigate this matter and not let this phenomenon continue.
    Li Qiasheng

    Suggest the Municipal Government Repair the Ditch　The stinky ditch beside the street at Dashiqiao outside Chongwenmen in Beijing, every summer, makes people want to vomit, which is really detrimental to the health of the residents there. And the roadbed beside the ditch is narrow, and every summer rain, the road is muddy, and vehicles often overturn into the ditch. In the past, the Kuomintang never cared about this. After the liberation of Beijing, a small part was repaired, but not all of it was repaired. Please convey to the Beijing Municipal People's Government to carry out repairs (using cement pipes or building culverts) to benefit the health of the residents.

专栏：读者意见

　　对市政的建议
    近来本报接到读者对于市政建设许多积极意见，我们认为这些意见无论对读者，对有关机关，都是有帮助的。现特摘要披露，望能引起有关各方的注意。  ——编者
    节省汽油　解放战争需要汽油很多，我区汽油又很缺乏，因此节省汽油是万分重要的。但目前我们兵站部门内有因私人小事而浪费汽油的，我们认为应有严格规定才好。　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
　　供校严梅
    电话坏了应快修好　北平至门头沟的长途电话，自三月底即已因线断不能通话。电话局也不答复什么时候能够修好。请主管部门注意检查一下。
    禁止铁轮大车在汽车路上通行　平市汽车路近因铁轮大车不断来往，路基多被轧坏。建议主管部门派人视察修补，并望严令禁止铁轮大车通行。
    刘廷范
    取缔赌棍　近来在王府井大街发现有十来个人的一伙子，互相勾搭，用纸牌做流动性的赌博骗局，诈取老实市民和青年钱财，动辄殴打行凶。并有少数破坏分子撕毁街头标语和宣传画等，望本市公安机关注意取缔。
    郑运达
    建立交通秩序　为了建立交通秩序，我们愿意提供一点意见供有关方面参考：
    １、电车站要有明确的标示，乘客要等下车的下来完了再上车。
    ２、禁止在电车门外或车后边站人，以及骑自行车者扶车或追车跑，以免发生危险。
    ３、近来时有三轮车在转弯时不照路伞盘转，而直接冲了过去；放车时任意乱放，有的停在人行道上，有的停在市场门口（如东安市场西口）警察也不过问。请公安局注意。
    谢大道
    黑车票应取缔　现在前门外东车站有卖黑票的事情。开到天津的快车票是一百二十元，一小时以前就卖完了，而广场附近的黑票却很多。卖价是一百八十元或二百元。这种现象群众反映很坏，是否与站内卖票的有关系呢？我觉得有关部门应当彻底调查一下，不要让这种现象继续下去。
    李洽生
    建议市府修整水沟　北平市崇文门外大石桥，每逢夏天街旁那条臭水沟，令人闻之欲呕，实在对该地居民卫生有碍。且沟旁路基狭窄，每逢夏雨，路途泥泞，往来车辆时常倾复沟中。以往国民党对此从未过问。北平解放后，曾修葺了一小部分，但未全部修好。请贵报转达北平市人民政府，进行修整（用洋灰管或砌暗沟），以利居民卫生。
　王泽民
