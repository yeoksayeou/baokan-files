　　Regarding Boiler Horsepower Questions
    Regarding the questions about boiler horsepower asked by Comrade Yi Xin, the North Hebei Electric Power Co., Ltd. has been asked to provide a simple answer to each item as follows:

    (1) There are two definitions of boiler horsepower: (A) Each boiler horsepower is equal to the amount of heat required to evaporate 34.5 pounds of water at 212 degrees Fahrenheit to saturated steam at the same temperature per hour, which is also equal to the amount of heat transmitted from the boiler to the water, 33,472 British thermal units per hour. (B) According to the heating surface area of the boiler (referring to the boiler body, excluding economizers, etc.), 10 square feet is equal to one boiler horsepower.

    Note: The above is an older definition and is actually not very reasonable, as it does not truly represent the boiler capacity and is also unrelated to the horsepower generated by the turbine or steam engine supplied by the boiler. Therefore, the currently used standard is the amount of steam evaporation per hour (tons or pounds).

    (2) The "pounds" on the steam gauge usually refer to the pressure per square inch. To calculate the heat of steam, in addition to pressure, the temperature must also be known. Then, it can be found on the steam chart. Except for saturated steam, it is impossible to calculate the heat by only knowing the pressure. For example, for steam with a pressure of 200 pounds per square inch (absolute pressure), if it is saturated steam (temperature equal to 382 degrees Fahrenheit), the heat per pound is 1198 British thermal units. If the temperature is equal to 500 degrees Fahrenheit, the heat is equal to 1269 British thermal units. If the temperature is equal to 550 degrees Fahrenheit, the heat is equal to 1296 British thermal units.

    (3) Most diesel fuel is refined from crude oil extracted from oil wells, and a small amount is also produced by low-temperature distillation of coal, hydrogenation of coal, or from vegetable oil. Regarding the question about efficiency, I don’t know if it refers to the calorific value per unit weight. In terms of calorific value, diesel fuel, gasoline, and kerosene are similar. However, if referring to the efficiency of use in engines, generally speaking, diesel engines have higher thermal efficiency than gasoline or kerosene engines. The chemical composition of diesel fuel mainly consists of hydrocarbons, with small amounts of nitrogen, sulfur, etc.

### 关于锅炉马力诸问题

　　关于锅炉马力诸问题
    关于一新同志所问锅炉马力诸问题，已请冀北电力有限公司逐项简单答复如下：
    （一）锅炉马力定义有二：（甲）每一锅炉马力等于每点钟能蒸发三四·五磅，华氏二一二度之水至同温度之饱和蒸汽之热量，亦即等于每点钟由锅炉传达于水三三·四七二英热单位之热量。（乙）依据锅炉受热面积（指锅炉本体，不包括俭煤器等）规定十平方英尺等于一锅炉马力。
    注意：上述为较老之定义，实际上不甚合理，因其并不能真正代表锅炉容量，并与锅炉所供给之汽轮机或蒸汽机发出之马力亦无关，故目前常用者为每点钟之蒸汽蒸发量（吨或磅）。
    （二）汽表上的磅，普通指每平方英寸所受的压力，欲计算蒸汽热量，除压力外，尚须知道温度，于是在蒸汽图表上即可查得，除去饱和蒸汽外只知道压力是无法计算热量的。例如压力每平方英寸二百磅（绝对压力）之蒸汽，如系饱和蒸汽（温度等于华氏三八二度）每磅热量系一一九八英热单位，如温度等于华氏五○○度，热量等于一二六九英热单位，如温度等于五五○度，热量等于一二九六英热单位。
    （三）柴油大多数是由油井所出的原油分馏提炼而来的，也有少数是由煤炭低温蒸馏法，煤炭加氢法或由植物油制造的，所问效力不知是否指每单位重量之发热量而言。以发热量言则柴油与汽油，煤油差不多，但如指用在发动机的效率言，则一般讲，柴油机较汽油机或煤油机之热效率均高。柴油之化学成份，主要为炭氢化合物，另有少量的氮、硫等。
