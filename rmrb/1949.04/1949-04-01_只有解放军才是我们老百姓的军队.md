　　"Only the People's Liberation Army is our People's Army"
　　To the Editor:
　　We are workers at the Cotton Improvement Office. My name is Xiao Guanghai, I am sixty years old, and I have been a worker for most of my life. I have been burning the boiler in the basement of the Cotton Improvement Office for seven or eight years. He Shengqi is younger than me and has also been a worker for more than ten years. In the past, no one looked up to us. Since the liberation of Beiping, we have been working day and night to protect property during the Military Control Commission's takeover and inventory of materials, and we were elected as models. Now the People's Liberation Army has come to comfort us, and we really feel honored; we are truly liberated! In order to express our respect for the People's Liberation Army, we specially asked someone to write this letter to express our gratitude to the People's Liberation Army.
  　　　　　　Military Control Commission takes over the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry Cotton Improvement Office
  　　　Workers　Xiao Guanghai He Shengqi
  　　　　　　　　And all the workers March 21st
　　On the 16th of this month, as we were getting off work, a burst of drum sounds came from afar... Before long, Zhang Hongfei, the platoon leader of the Second Platoon of the Ninth Company of a certain regiment of the 41st Army of the People's Liberation Army, led all the comrades of his platoon, drumming and walking into the iron gate of our Cotton Improvement Office. Everyone thought that the People's Liberation Army was here to perform the Yangko dance again (because not long after the liberation of Beiping, the People's Liberation Army had performed the Yangko dance in our office). A large group of children followed, and several climbed onto the iron gate.
　　We also ran out of the room to watch the excitement, but unexpectedly, Platoon Leader Zhang came directly to us two, which surprised us.
　　We heard from Liaison Officer Shi that they were here to comfort us! Platoon Leader Zhang said that because their class lived here, we often took care of them and gave them water to drink, so they were very grateful. They automatically requested from their superiors and were allowed to come and comfort us. Oh! When we first heard this, we really didn't know how to answer.
　　A few days ago, Platoon Leader Zhang did say that he wanted to come and comfort us, but we didn't care, thinking he was just joking. Today, he really brought all the comrades of the platoon, beating gongs and drums, singing to us, saluting us, and giving us towels and dry tobacco. Dozens of comrades came to our dark basement. Platoon Leader Zhang also spoke to us on behalf of all the comrades, saying that they would liberate all the oppressed working people in China. They also repeatedly called us "old uncles," which made us feel very sad. We wanted to say something, but we couldn't say it.
　　Platoon Leader Zhang said that they were all born poor, and they understood the difficulties of the poor. They were fighting for the working masses. They lived in the Cotton Improvement Office and said they felt that we treated them too well. Alas! What Platoon Leader Zhang said is true. We also understand who they are fighting for and who they are working hard for, so we voluntarily take care of them and give them some water to drink. This is nothing. Which of us workers is not poor? Aren't they fighting for us? People's hearts are made of flesh, and we should do our best; who would have thought that they would come to comfort us! In the past, we lived in the basement for three hundred and sixty days a year, and rarely went out to play on Sundays. We suffered and sweated, and when we got sick... who would even come to see us? Now we are truly liberated.
　　After the People's Liberation Army comforted us, we were so moved that we didn't know what to do. All the workers in our office were also moved and didn't know what to do. We have never received such comfort. When Platoon Leader Zhang led his platoon of People's Liberation Army comrades out of the narrow door of our year-round sunless basement, we really felt hot in our hearts and wet in our eyes. We deeply felt that "only the People's Liberation Army is our people's army."

　　“只有解放军才是我们老百姓的军队”
    编辑同志：
    我们是棉产改进处的工役，我叫萧广海，今年六十岁，当了多半辈子工人，在棉产改进处地下室烧锅炉也有七八年了。何胜启比我年轻，也当了十多年的工人。已往的年头谁也瞧不起我们。北平解放了，在军管会接收物资、清点物资中，为了保护财产我们白日黑夜的干，就选举了我们模范。现在解放军又来慰劳我们，实在感觉荣幸；我们真正解放了！为了表达我们对人民解放军的敬意，特请人写了这封信，以表示我们对解放军感激的心意。
  　　　　　　军管会接管农林部棉产改进处
  　　　工役　萧广海  何胜启
  　　　　　　　　暨全体工役　三月二十一日
    本月十六日，在我们下班的时候，一阵冬冬的鼓声，从远处传了来……不大工夫，有解放军四一军某团九连二排排长张鸿飞率领着全排同志们，打着鼓，走进了我们棉产改进处的铁栅栏门，大家都以为解放军又来扭秧歌了（因北平解放不久，解放军在我们处里扭过一次秧歌）附近的孩子跟了一大群，铁栅栏门上也爬上去好几个。
    我们也从屋里跑出来瞧热闹，没想到张排长进来以后，就专找到了我们俩，倒叫我们一楞。
    听石联络员说，他们是慰劳我们来啦！张排长说，因为他们的这一个班住在这儿时，我们时常照应他们，给他们送水喝，因此他们大伙儿感谢得很，他们自动的向上级要求，准许他们来慰劳我们。哎呀！我们乍一听这话，真不知道怎么回答好了。
    前几天张排长倒是说过要来慰劳我们的话，我们并没介意，以为说着玩儿呢。今天真的带着全排的同志，敲锣打鼓，又给我们唱歌、行礼，又送给我们毛巾旱烟，几十位同志都来到我们这黑暗的地下室里，张排长还代表全排的同志向我们讲话，说他们还要解放全中国被压迫的劳动人民。他们还口口声声的叫我们老大爷，那老大爷长、老大爷短的，叫得我们心里好难过，我们想说什么，也说不出口了。
    张排长说他们大伙儿都是穷汉子出身，穷人的难处，他们都明白，他们打仗，就是为了劳苦大众，他们住在棉产改进处，说是感觉到我们待他们太好。唉！张排长说的话真对，我们也明白，他们为谁在打仗，为谁在吃苦奋斗，所以才自动的照应照应，给送点水喝，这算不了什么。我们当工役的，那个不是穷人，他们打仗不就是为了我们吗？人心都是肉长的，我们本应该尽心的；谁想到他们又来慰劳我们来呢！已往我们一年三百六十天，住在地下室，很少有个礼拜日出去玩玩，我们受苦流汗，我们生了病，……又有谁来打个照面，瞧我们一眼呢？现在真是解放了。
    解放军慰劳完了我们，我们感动得不知道怎么样儿好了，我们全处的工友们在一旁也被感动得不知如何是好。我们从来没有受过这样的慰劳。当张排长率领着他那一排解放军的同志们，走出了我们这长年不见太阳的地下室的窄门时，我们的确觉着心里热辣辣的，眼里湿漉漉的，我们深切的感觉到“只有解放军才是咱们老百姓的军队”。
