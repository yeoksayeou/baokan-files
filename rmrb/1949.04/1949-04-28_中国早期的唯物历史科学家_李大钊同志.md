China's Early Materialist Historical Scientist
    ——Comrade Li Dazhao
    Fan Wenlan Wang Nan
    What changes is the process of youth,
    What remains unchanged is endless youth...
    What our youth should solemnly vow to show to the world
    Is not to quibble over the immortality of an aging China,
    But to eagerly nurture the rebirth of a youthful China.
    　　　　　——Li Dazhao: "Youth"
    Twenty-two years ago, right here in Beiping, imperialism and feudal warlords jointly strangled Comrade Li Dazhao. Comrade Dazhao sacrificed himself for the Chinese people's anti-imperialist and anti-feudal revolutionary cause, that is, for the revolutionary cause led by the Chinese Communist Party. Today, the revolutionary cause of the Chinese people led by the Chinese Communist Party has triumphed, and Beiping has forever become a city of the people. As we commemorate Comrade Dazhao at this time and in this place, we cannot help but think of the "endless youth" he praised and want to tell him that the youthful China he nurtured with his life and blood has been "reborn." Today's commemoration of Comrade Dazhao in Beiping, this meaningful fact, proves to us once again: Those who unite with the eternally youthful people will never age, and those who unite with the immortal people will be immortal.
    Comrade Dazhao was one of China's early Marxist propagandists and theorists, one of the founders of the Chinese Communist Party, and an immortal fighter in the history of the Chinese revolution. I will not talk much about these aspects, but simply mention Comrade Dazhao as an early historical scientist in China.
    Comrade Dazhao's contribution to historical science should first of all include what he said about "the influence of modern historical research on the attitude towards life." Some scholars say that "historical research is becoming increasingly serious, which is a sign that human spirit is gradually maturing. In the juvenile period of intellectual development, they do not pay much attention to the things that human beings have done in the past, but pay attention to the things that human beings can do in the future, in order to excite them. History should be made into a legendary novel to ignite their imagination." Comrade Dazhao opposed this view. He advocated "enthusiastically studying the past" in order to "illuminate the path of life" and "recognize the road of human progress." "All the past is material for us to use. Our future is created by our current labor, relying on the material of the past. This is the scientific attitude that modern historical science gives us. This scientific attitude creates our down-to-earth outlook on life." Comrade Dazhao said, "Modern historical science tells us that living history is not just these past records. Living history is actually the life of all mankind spanning the past, present, and future. The past, present, and future are connected by a single thread...The path of history, even if it sometimes moves in a spiral pattern of prosperity and decline, is still advancing and ascending in a cycle, not stagnant or retrogressive in a cycle. This gives us a progressive worldview. Since we believe that the world is progressive and history is progressive, we should not be pessimistic or worship the ancients in this progressive world and history, but joyfully walk forward on the road that only allows one passage. The future has our light, and the future has our golden world. This is the optimistic and progressive outlook on life that modern historical science gives us." Comrade Dazhao said, "The history compiled based on the old historical view puts the privileged classes such as emperors, kings, dukes, and earls under the protection of divine power, so that the general people cannot resist or even dare to resent the chaos and hardships they have suffered...In this kind of history, we can only find gods, emperors, saints, and kings, but we can never find ourselves...The new historical view and the history compiled based on the new historical view are different. It teaches us that the driving force of social life is not the 'illustrious' and 'majestic' gods, nor the 'heaven-sent' and 'divinely endowed' sages, but the survival of society itself. The discovery of knowledge, the invention of technology, and even the application of these discoveries and inventions to practical use are all the result of the labor of everyone in society like us. This progress in living technology changes the entire life of society and improves the stage of history. This historical view guides us to discover our world and ourselves in history, makes us aware of our own authority, and knows that the history of the past was jointly created by people like us, and the history of the present and even the future will still be the same...The so-called heroes and great men are not different from ordinary people, but they feel the demands of society more keenly and are more enthusiastic to satisfy the demands of society, so they stand up and dedicate themselves to society, leaving behind tragic and magnificent dramas in history that are worth singing and weeping about."
    Comrade Dazhao himself firmly recognized and repeatedly declared to people that "social change is history." The ideological source of this historical view is the materialist historical view of Marx and Engels that he wanted to strive to master, and the main reason why he wanted to strive to master this historical view was that he was a revolutionary who wanted to "change" the old Chinese society and jointly "create" a new Chinese society with "people like us," because he advocated academically that "any kind of knowledge or learning must be useful to life to be true knowledge and true learning, otherwise it cannot be said to be learning or knowledge." Because he believed that "learning is all about seeking truth, and history is especially so." (Because anti-revolutionary and anti-people guys must cover up the true history and fabricate false history, such as the current American imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries - Wenlan)
    The above excerpts are all from Comrade Dazhao's "Essentials of Historiography," published in 1942. As early as January 1920, he wrote "The Value of the Materialist Conception of History in Modern Historiography" in the New Youth magazine. In December of the same year, he published his article explaining the causes of ideological changes in modern China from an economic perspective. This was an early attempt in China to deal with Chinese historical problems using the method of materialist historical view. It was precisely because Comrade Dazhao was a Marxist revolutionary and historical scientist that when everyone cheered and celebrated the "Allied victory" in 1918, only he could see that the result of World War I was the "victory of the common people" and the "victory of Bolshevism." In China at that time, this can truly be said to be unique insight.
    In summary, in Comrade Dazhao's own words, his historical view is not "worshipping the past" but "loving the present," not "destiny" but "progress," not the so-called "academic interest" of "doing something for nothing" but to "transform" society and "create" society, and advocates the unity of "seeking truth" and "usefulness." This people's historical view, a historical view full of combativeness, is not only higher than the general vulgar historical view of the same period as Comrade Dazhao, but is still very valuable even today.
    Finally, I want to make it clear that Comrade Dazhao has written many works on history, but I have seen very few now. The above is just to talk about one or two points extracted from his works. Furthermore, Comrade Dazhao was an early Marxist historical scientist in China. In our view today, his works are of course inevitably immature, but as Mr. Lu Xun said, "His posthumous writings will last forever because it is the legacy of pioneers and a monument in the history of revolution."

　　中国早期的唯物历史科学家
    ——李大钊同志
    范文澜　王南
    其变者青春之进程，
    其不变者无尽之青春也。……
    吾族青年所当信誓旦旦以昭示于世者，
    不在龈龈辩证白首中国之不死，
    乃在汲汲孕育青春中国之再生。
    　　　　　——李大钊：“青春”
    距今二十二周年以前，就在北平这个地方，帝国主义与封建军阀共同绞死了李大钊同志。大钊同志是为中国人民反帝反封建的革命事业而牺牲的，也就是为中国共产党所领导的革命事业而牺牲的；今天，中国共产党所领导的中国人民的革命事业胜利了，北平永远成了人民的城市，在这个时候这个地方来纪念大钊同志，我们不禁想到他所歌颂的“无尽之青春”，想要向他说，他以生命和热血所孕育的青春中国，已经“再生”了。今天在北平纪念大钊同志，这个富有意义的事实，又向我们证明了：凡与青春不老的人民相结合者，其人不老，凡与不朽的人民相结合者，其人不朽。
    大钊同志是中国早期的马克思主义的宣传家理论家之一，是中国共产党创建人之一，是中国革命史上不朽的战斗者。这些方面我不多谈，只是极简单的提一提作为中国早期的历史科学家的大钊同志。
    大钊同志在历史科学上的功绩，首先应该提出的，就是他所说的“现代史学的研究及于人生态度的影响”。某些学者说“史学研究日趋严重，是人类精神渐即老成的征兆，在智力的少年时期，他们不很注意人间曾经作过的事物，却注意到那些将来人类所可作的事物，为的是兴奋他们，历史似应作成一个传奇小说的样子，以燃烧他们的想象”。大钊同志反对这种说法，他主张“很热心的去研究过去”，是为的“去照彻人生经过的道路”，“可以认识出来人生前进的大路”。“一切过去，都是供我们利用的材料。我们的将来，是我们凭借过去的材料，现在的劳作创造出来的。这是现代史学给我们的科学的态度。这种科学的态度，造成我们脚踏实地的人生观”。大钊同志说“现代的史学告我们以有生命的历史不是这些过去的记录。有生命的历史，实是一个亘过去现在未来的全人类的生活。过去现在未来是一线贯下来的。……历史的进路，纵然有时一盛一衰一衰一盛的作螺旋状的运动，但此亦是循环着前进的，上升的，不是循环着停滞的，亦不是循环着逆返的，退落的，这样子给我们以一个进步的世界观。我们既认定世界是进步的，历史是进步的，我们在此进步的世界中，历史中，即不应该悲观，不应该拜古，只应欢天喜地的在这只容一趟过的大路上向前行走，前途有我们的光明，将来有我们的黄金世界。这是现代史学给我们的乐天努进的人生观”。大钊同志说“本着旧史观所编的历史，全把那皇帝王公侯伯世们等特权阶级放在神权保护之下，使一般人民对于所遭的丧乱，所受的艰难……不但不能反抗，抑且不敢怨恨……在这种历史中，所能找出来的，只是些上帝，皇天、圣人、王者，决找不到我们的自己。……新历史观及本着新历史观编成的历史则不然，他教吾人以社会生活的动因，不在‘赫赫’‘皇矣’的天神，不在‘天＠’‘天纵’的圣哲，乃在社会的生存的本身。一个知识的发现，技术的发明，乃至把是等发现发明致之于实用，都是象我们一样的社会上的人人劳作的结果。这种生活技术的进步，变动了社会的全生活，改进了历史的阶段。这种历史观，导引我们在历史中发现了我们的世界，发现了我们的自己，使我们自觉我们自己的权威，知道过去的历史，就是我们这样的人人共同造出来的，现在乃至将来的历史，亦还是如此。…所谓英雄所谓豪杰的人物，并非与常人有何殊异，只是他们感觉到这社会的要求敏锐些，想满足这社会的要求的情绪热烈些，所以挺身而起，为社会献身，在历史上留下可歌可泣的悲剧、壮剧。”
    大钊同志自己坚定的认识到和再三的向人宣说“社会的变革便是历史”。这种历史观的思想上的渊源，就是他所要努力掌握的马克思和恩格斯的唯物史观，而他所以要努力来掌握这种史观，则主要的由于他是一个要“变革”中国旧社会，要和“我们这样的人人共同造出来”中国新社会的革命者，由于他在学术上主张“凡是一种学问，或是一种知识，必于人生有用，才是真的学问，真的知识，否则不能说他是学问，或是知识。”由于他相信“学都所以求真，而历史的尤然。”（因为反革命反人民的家伙，一定要掩盖真历史，捏造伪历史，如目前的美帝国主义和国民党反动派均是——文澜）
    上面这些摘录，都出自大钊同志所作的一九四二年出版的“史学要论”，他远在一九二○年一月出版新青年杂志上，即写出“唯物史观在现代史学上的价值。”同年十二月又刊出他所写由经济上解释中国近代思想变动的原因，这是中国早期企图用唯物史观的方法来处理中国历史问题的尝试。正由大钊同志是马克思主义的革命者和历史科学家，所以当一九一八年，大家欢呼庆祝“联军胜利”的时候，只有他能够看出第一次世界大战的结果，是“庶民的胜利”，是“布尔什维主义的胜利”。这在当时中国，真可以说是独具慧眼。
    总括起来，用大钊同志自己的语句来说，他的历史观，不是“拜古”的，而是“爱今”的，不是“天命”的，而是“进步”的，不是所谓“无所为而为”的“学问之趣味”，而是要“变革”社会“创造”社会的，而是主张“求真”与“有用”合一的。这种人民的历史观，富有战斗性的历史观，不仅高出与大钊同志同时期的一般庸俗的历史观，就是在今天看来，仍然是很可宝贵的。
    最后，我要说明白，大钊同志有关历史学的著作很多，现在我所见到的却很少，以上只是就其著作中抽出一两点来谈谈。再有，大钊同志是中国早期的马克思主义的历史科学家，在我们今天看来，其著作当然难免有不成熟的地方，但这恰如鲁迅先生所说，“他的遗文却将永在，因为它是先驱者的遗产，革命史上的丰碑。”
