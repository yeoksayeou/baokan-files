Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 9th: Reports from various sources state that the new, heavy budget presented by Cripps on the 6th has aroused the anger of the British people, who are already among the most heavily taxed in the world. An Associated Press dispatch from London on the 7th admitted: "No matter who you ask among the citizens of London, the response is one of anger." The British people, who had been anxiously awaiting the new budget for days, hoping that the Labour government could somewhat improve their current miserable situation, experienced "intense disappointment as their initial reaction" (Agence France-Presse). The wife of a construction worker said: "My husband just heard the budget on the radio and immediately went out to drink." Cripps' new budget also "aroused fierce opposition within the Labour Party" (United Press). Labour MP, Mr. Huffs, compared Cripps' new budget to the Nazi slogan of "Guns before Butter". He said: "Five years after the end of the war, our Chancellor of the Exchequer is still talking about guns before butter."

　　“大炮代替牛油”的英国版
    克利浦斯提出苛重预算　
    英国人民同表愤怒
    【新华社北平九日电】各方报道：克利浦斯六日提出的新的沉重预算，引起了世界上纳税最重的英国人民的愤怒。美联社伦敦七日电承认：“随便你询问伦敦市民，所得的反应都是愤怒”。若干日来即在焦急地等待新预算，幻想工党政府能够多少改善他们目前悲惨状况的英国人，“对它的第一个反应是强烈的失望”（法新社）。一位建筑工人的妻子说：“我的丈夫刚从无线电中听到预算，便马上出去喝酒去了。”克利浦斯的新预算，同样也“引起了工党党内的激烈反对”（合众社）。工党议员霍夫斯将克利浦斯新预算与纳粹的“大炮代替牛油”口号相比拟。他说：“在战争结束五年之后，我们的财相却大谈其大炮先于牛油。”
