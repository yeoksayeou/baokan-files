　　The Thriving New Book Industry in Beiping
　　Chen Ji

　　Since the liberation of Beiping, the newly opened bookstores have been packed with customers every day due to the enthusiastic demand for revolutionary knowledge from workers, students. The Xinhua Bookstore began operations on February 10th and successively established three branches on Wangfujing Street, Xidan, and Qianmen. In the first few days, nearly 9,000 books were purchased by readers every day; now, the daily sales are still over 4,000 books. Among them, Chairman Mao's works sell the most; "On New Democracy" is the most popular among readers. The total number sold in Beiping has now exceeded 100,000 copies, and this does not fully include those privately reprinted by some merchants. Although the New China Bookstore has only one branch, the average number of customers is at least over 1,000 per day. Each person is limited to buying one book, and on average, more than 1,000 books are sold per day. If sales were unrestricted, it is estimated that 10,000 books could be sold per day. In addition to students from various schools buying books, more and more orders are being placed by workers' organizations in various factories.

　　The biggest difficulty currently faced by the several new cultural bookstores in Beiping is that the supply cannot meet the demand. Except for more than 20 kinds of books published in Tianjin and Beiping, most of their books are supplied by the Northeast Bookstore, and some are published by the North China Xinhua Bookstore. They are now planning to publish a large number of new books in Tianjin and Beiping. In addition, they generally lose money on the books they sell, because paper and ink are expensive, and the selling price often cannot cover the original cost. However, they all emphasized that engaging in the new cultural publishing industry today is to serve the people, and a purely business-oriented viewpoint must be resolutely opposed. As long as all of China is liberated, the current difficulties will be easily solved. Currently, various bookstores are preparing to jointly publish "Study Life" to connect with the vast number of readers and to regularly conduct criticism and discussions to improve the revolutionary publishing industry.

　　In Beiping, in addition to Xinhua Bookstore, etc., many new book stalls selling revolutionary books have also appeared in Dong'an Market and Xidan Shopping Center. They are naturally and gradually replacing the foul-smelling old book stalls. Mandarin Duck Butterfly novels and fortune-telling books are gradually losing their readers. The reporter once visited these book stalls. Their current problem is also the lack of sources of books. In order to earn more money, they mainly buy and sell privately reprinted pamphlets from unknown sources, which is a very serious problem. Because besides those printed according to the original text, many are excerpts. Among these pamphlets, several have been found to be fabricated, such as the "Urban and Rural Land and Housing Reform Law." This has a very bad influence on readers. In addition, some book stalls also sell obscene pictorials and novels. These things should be banned.

　　前进中的北平新书业
    陈迹
    北平解放后，由于职工学生热烈要求学习革命知识，新开张的几家书店里天天挤满了顾客。新华书店从二月十日开始营业，先后在王府井大街、西单、前门成立了三个门市部，在刚开始的几天里，每天近九千册的书被读者购去；现在每天也要销出四千多册。其中以毛主席的著作卖得最多；新民主主义论最受读者的欢迎，在北平销出的总数现已超过十万册，这还不完全包括一些商人私自翻印的在内。新中国书店虽然只有一个门市部，每天顾客平均至少有一千人以上，每人购书只限于一册，平均一天也要卖出一千多册。如果放手去卖，估计每天可卖到一万册。除了各校学生买书之外，各工厂职工团体订购的也比较多了。
    现在北平的几个新文化书店，所遇到的最大困难，就是供不应求。他们的书，除了二十多种书是平津出版的以外，绝大部分是靠东北书店供给，还有些是华北新华书店出版的。现在他们正筹划在平津大量出版新书。另外，他们卖出的书，一般都要亏本，因为纸张油墨贵，卖出的价钱往往买不回原来的东西。不过他们都强调地说，今天干新文化出版事业，是为人民服务，纯营业观点是要坚决反对的。只要全中国解放了，目前的困难是很容易解决的。现在各书店正准备联合出版一个“学习生活”，用以和广大读者联系，并经常开展批评与讨论，以改进革命的出版事业。
    在北平除了新华书店等以外，在东安市场和西单商场也出现了许多出售革命书籍的新书摊。它们已在自然地逐步地代替着腐臭不堪的旧书摊。鸳鸯蝴蝶、看相说命的东西，逐渐减少了它们的读者。记者曾访问过这些书摊，他们现在的问题，也是书籍来源不多。他们为要多赚几个钱，所以主要是在买卖那些来路不明的人私自翻印的小册子，这是一个很严重的问题。因为那些小册子除了根据原文印的而外，不少是摘录的。在这些小册子里，现已发现有几本是捏造的，如“城市乡村土地房屋改革法”就是一例。这对于读者有莫大的恶劣影响。另外，在有些书摊上，还出卖着淫秽的画报和小说。这些东西，应当加以取缔。
