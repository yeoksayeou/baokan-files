    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 24th: Key Kuomintang figures, having become like stray dogs due to the demise of the Nanjing puppet regime, fled south again less than twelve hours after escaping to Shanghai. The bogus Acting President Li Zongren fled from Nanjing to Shanghai on the morning of the 23rd, and then immediately fled to Guilin with his confidants Cheng Siyuan, Qiu Changwei, and others. Li Shizhen, the bogus principal of the Central Police Academy, Fang Zhi, the chairman of the Kuomintang Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters, and Yu Shuping, the former Shanghai Police Chief and special agent head, also fled to Keelung, Taiwan on the 23rd. The hidden war criminal Chiang Kai-shek has now emerged from his lair in Xikou, fantasizing about salvaging his last remaining strength. On the morning of the 23rd, the Chiang bandit arrived in Shanghai by plane and held a meeting with the bogus Premier of the Executive Yuan, He Yingqin, and others who had fled Shanghai from Nanjing.

　　国民党首要分子惶惶如丧家之狗
    【新华社北平二十四日电】由于南京小朝廷的灭亡而成为丧家之犬的国民党首要分子，在逃到上海不及十二小时后又继续向南逃亡。伪代总统李宗仁于二十三日晨由南京逃到上海，旋即携带亲信程思远、邱昌渭等逃往桂林。伪中央警校校长李士珍，国民党沪市党部主委方治，前上海警察局长特务头子俞叔平等，也于二十三日逃到台湾基隆。隐身幕后的战犯蒋介石现在已由溪口钻出来幻想挽救他的最后残余力量。蒋匪于二十三日早晨乘飞机抵沪，与由南京逃沪的伪行政院长何应钦等举行会议。
