Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan Front, 22nd – The People's Liberation Army on the Taiyuan front completely cleared out all enemy strongholds outside Taiyuan city by the morning of the 22nd. With the exception of the enemy's "Iron-Blood Division" surrendering, all the enemy troops defending the city's outskirts were annihilated. According to confirmed figures, the People's Liberation Army captured a total of over 23,000 enemy soldiers, including Liu Xiaozeng, commander of the 43rd Army, Yan Junxian, commander of the 46th Division, Wang Tonghai, commander of the Engineer Division, Qi Guochao, commander of the 73rd Division, and Zhang Zhong, commander of the 71st Division. Six tanks and over 250 artillery pieces of various types were seized. Huangjiafen and Shuangta Temple, the last two strongholds captured by the People's Liberation Army this morning, were the strongest fortresses outside Taiyuan city, built by the bandit Yan over four years. Huangjiafen is located three miles northeast of the city, and Shuangta Temple is five miles southeast of the city. Both are situated on strategic high slopes, with heavy troops and powerful artillery groups stationed there, as well as dense bunkers, firing points, moats, and tunnels. However, under the PLA's powerful attack, they were breached in just five minutes and completely occupied in three hours.

　　太原城郊我军
  　扫清敌全部据点
  　俘敌军师长以下已逾二万
    【新华社太原前线二十二日电】太原前线的人民解放军已于二十二日晨肃清太原城外敌全部据点，除敌“铁血师”投诚外，城外守敌悉数被歼。据已查明者，解放军共俘虏敌四十三军军长刘效曾、四十六师师长阎俊贤、工兵师师长王同海、七十三师师长祁国朝、七十一师师长张忠等以下二万三千余名。缴获坦克六辆，各种炮二百五十余门。解放军今日晨最后攻克的黄家坟和双塔寺两据点，是阎匪修筑四年之久的太原城外最强固的要塞。黄家坟在城东北三里，双塔寺在城东南五里。两处都在险要的高坡上，除驻有重兵和强大的炮群外，筑有密集的碉堡、火力点、濠沟和坑道等。但在解放军的攻击威力下，仅五分钟即被突破，三小时即被完全占领。
