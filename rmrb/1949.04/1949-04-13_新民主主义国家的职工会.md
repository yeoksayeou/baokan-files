　　Trade Unions in New Democratic Countries
　　By B. Fuda. Boksha Translated by Yang Huilin
　　The trade unions in new democratic countries include most of the industrial workers, staff, and intellectuals.
　　The unity of the trade union movement—the lack of which caused many failures for the working class in the past and disarmed it in the face of the growing threat of fascism—was achieved as a result of the painful experience of the working people. This experience was gained at the cost of blood and tears in the people's liberation struggle under the leadership of the Communists. Unity was also won as a result of the heroic Soviet Red Army liberating these countries.
　　Today, vast prospects are unfolding before the mass organizations of the working class, the trade unions, which occupy a leading position in the new national system. These organizations of the working class have never shown such great strength as they do now. They unite the vast working people who were divided in the past by various obstacles and prejudices.
　　Today, in the new democratic countries, trade unions are one of the main parts of the people's front. It is an important barrier to the new state power. After the nationalization of most industries, banks, and large-scale commerce, the working class now leads the country's economy together with the working people. Aware of its own historical mission, organized by the trade unions, the working class is a barrier to its own vanguard Communist Party and Workers' Party in rebuilding life under socialist principles.
　　This fundamentally changes the status of trade unions, faces them with new tasks, and makes it possible—even necessary—for them to adopt new methods to protect the economic interests of workers, employees, and intellectuals.
　　In their activities, trade unions note that the realization of general domestic tasks and the struggle for the transformation of new democratic countries into socialist countries are inseparable from the struggle for a higher standard of living for the people. Although trade unions are still organizations that safeguard the material and cultural interests of the working people, in the new democratic society they are becoming an important factor in national and social life. It is educating the working people in the spirit of loyalty to the new state order and socialism. It is a school where workers learn how to be masters of future society and the state. Like the trade unions in the Soviet Union, the trade unions in new democratic countries are mass schools for managing the state and the economy; as Lenin said, "schools of communism."
　　　　Achievements of Trade Union Work
　　The working class in the new democratic countries shattered the reactionary plans. The reactionaries had hoped for the collapse of the nationalization of industry, which was laying the economic foundation for socialist development. Regardless of the enormous post-war difficulties and organizational shortcomings, production in these countries is steadily rising, constantly breaking through plans, and labor productivity is increasing.
　　Last spring, Polish production increased by 152 percent compared to the pre-war level, in Bulgaria it was 134 percent, in Hungary it was 127 percent, and in Czechoslovakia it was 110 percent. Romania, which only recently nationalized its industry, has also largely reached its pre-war production level.
　　This is the result of the efforts of the Communist Party, the Workers' Party, and the trade unions. This is the result of the fact that the working class is now working for itself and its own country instead of for the capitalists.
　　The trade unions in the new democratic countries have given great attention to strengthening the nationalized industry, increasing and improving production, and increasing labor productivity, which is the basis for the successful construction of socialism and the steady improvement of the people's lives. The transformation of the attitude towards labor—Lenin said that this is a more difficult and important factor in the victory of the new social system than overthrowing the bourgeoisie—has already begun in the new democratic countries. This can be seen very well from the continuous increase in the number of workers participating in labor competitions.
　　Along with the growth of production and the stability of the currency, trade unions have done extensive work to improve the living conditions of the working people. The Soviet Union's assistance to the new democratic countries in the form of supplying grain during droughts, reducing reparations, etc., has greatly facilitated this work.
　　For example, the real wages of Hungarian workers increased by 43 percent between October 1946 and July 1948. In Czechoslovakia, average wages increased by 37 percent from January 1946 to the spring of 1948. In particular, the price index did not change. The same picture is presented in other new democratic countries.
　　On the other hand, real wages are constantly declining in capitalist countries. This is true not only in countries strangled by the "Marshall Plan," but even in the United States itself, where real wages fell by 16.5 percent from January to mid-1945.
　　In Romania, Hungary and other new democratic countries, the prices of major commodities have been lowered and rations have been increased. In Poland, bread rationing has been abolished. According to the reactionary newspaper "Observer," prices in the United States rose by 8 percent in just one week from August 18 to 25.
　　The planned economy in the new democratic countries has eliminated unemployment. Surplus labor, especially in rural areas, is being rapidly absorbed into the expanding industry. In capitalist countries, on the contrary, unemployment is growing every day. Today, there are 2,500,000 unemployed people in the United States and 13,500,000 people who cannot get enough working hours.
　　In the new democratic countries, young people and women receive equal pay for equal work, have the right to enjoy vacations, and benefit from other major democratic reforms. Under the influence of trade unions, social insurance systems, labor protection, living conditions, and education are being improved. Industrial workers and office employees can receive medical treatment in sanatoriums and convalescent homes. Their children can be sent to nurseries, middle schools, and universities. Such care for the working people is impossible in capitalist countries.
　　In order to strengthen the ties between the working class and other working people, especially the working peasants, trade unions have supported the struggle of poor and middle peasants for land reform and other living interests. Trade unions are an important weapon in the struggle for the transition to socialism in rural areas, in the victory of the struggle for industrialization and the creation of new agricultural technologies, in helping poor and middle peasants establish cooperatives, and in supporting their struggle against rich peasants.
　　It must be pointed out here that the trade unions in the new democratic countries have carried out successful work in educating and mobilizing the masses to fight against reactionary forces—exploiters and parasites who are trying to exploit the temporary difficulties in these countries.
　　The Czech trade unions provide the most obvious example in this regard. In the "February Days," with their program and demands, the trade unions stood at the forefront under the leadership of the Communist Party, encouraging the general strike of workers, which ended in the complete victory of the broad masses.

　　新民主主义国家的职工会
    Ｂ·伏达·伯克沙作  杨慧琳译
    新民主主义国家的职工会，包括大部分的产业工人、职员和脑力劳动者。
    职工运动的统一——缺少这统一，使工人阶级在过去招致了许多失败，在法西斯主义日益威胁的面前解除了武装——作为劳动人民痛苦经验的结果而达到了。这一经验，是用在共产党员领导下的人民解放斗争的血与泪的代价取得的。统一，也作为英勇的苏联红军解放这些国家的结果而赢得了。
    今天在新的国家制度中居领导地位的工人阶级群众组织职工会的前面，展开了广大的前途。工人阶级的这些组织，从来没有表现过象现在这样强大的力量。它们团结了过去被各种障碍和偏见分裂开的广大劳动人民。
    今天在新民主主义国家中，职工会是人民阵线中主要部分之一。它是新国家权力的重要的屏障。在大部分工业、银行和大规模的商业国有化以后，工人阶级现在已和劳动人民一起领导着国家的经济了。觉悟到他自己的历史任务，用职工会把自己组织起来，工人阶级是他自己的先锋队共产党与工人党在社会主义原则下重建生活的屏障。
    这一点，基本上改变了职工会的地位，使它面对着新的任务，并使他可能——甚至必须——采取新的方式方法来保卫工人、雇员和脑力劳动者的经济利益。
    职工会在它们的活动中注意到实现一般的国内任务和由新民主主义国家转变到社会主义国家的斗争，是与争取人民更高的生活水准的斗争分不开的。职工会虽然仍旧是维护劳动人民物质与文化利益的组织，但是在新民主主义社会中它却正在成为国家和社会生活中重要的因素。它正在以忠于新的国家秩序和社会主义的精神来教育劳动人民。它是学校，工人们在这里学习怎样做将来社会与国家的主人。象苏联的职工会一样，新民主主义国家的职工会是管理国家和经济的群众的学校；如列宁所说是“共产主义的学校”。
    　　　　职工会工作的成绩
    新民主主义国家的工人阶级，粉碎了反动计划。反动分子曾指望正在奠定向社会主义发展的经济基础的工业国有化的垮台。不管战后巨大的困难和组织上的缺点，这些国家的生产正在稳固地上升，不断突破计划，劳动生产率正在增涨。
    去年春天，波兰生产比战前水平增进了百分之一百五十二，在保加利亚是百分之一百三十四，匈牙利是百分之一百二十七，捷克是百分之一百一十。罗马尼亚仅在最近才工业国有化，也大体上达到战前生产水平了。
    这是共产党、工人党和职工会努力的结果。这是工人阶级现在正为自己和自己的国家工作而不是为资本家工作这一事实的结果。
    新民主主义国家的职工会在加强国有化了的工业上，在增加和改进生产品上，在提高劳动生产率上给与了巨大的注意力，这是成功地建设社会主义和使人民生活稳固的改进的基础。对劳动态度的转变——列宁说过这在新社会制度的胜利中是比推翻资产阶级更困难更重要的因素——在新民主主义国家内已经开始了。这点从参加劳动竞赛的工人数目的不断增加上就能很好地看出来。
    随同生产的增长和币制的稳定，职工会对劳动人民的生活条件的改善上作了广泛的工作。苏联对新民主主义国家在荒旱时供给谷物，减少赔偿等等方式的帮助，使这一工作得到巨大的便利。
    例如，匈牙利工人的实际工资在一九四六年十月和一九四八年七月之间增加了百分之四十三。捷克在一九四六年正月到一九四八年春平均工资增加了百分之三十七。尤其是物价指数并没有变动。别的新民主主义国家也呈现了同样的画面。
    另方面在资本主义国家中实际工资是不断的下降。这不但在被“马歇尔计划”绞扼住的国家是这样，就是在美国本身从一九四五年正月到年中实际工资也降低了百分之十六·五。
    在罗马尼亚、匈牙利别的新民主主义国家，主要货物的价格降低了，口粮增加了。在波兰面包配给已经取消了。根据反动报纸“观察家”说，单单从八月十八到二十五一星期之内，美国的物价就涨了百分之八。
    在新民主主义国家有计划的经济消灭了失业。剩余劳动力，特别是农村的，正在迅速地被吸收到扩大中的工业中去。在资本主义国家则刚刚相反，失业正在每天增长着。今天美国有二，五○○，○○○人失业和一三，五○○，○○○人得不到足够的工作时间。
    在新民主主义国家，少年和妇女同工同酬，有享受休假的权利，并从其他巨大的民主改革中得到了利益。在职工会的影响下，社会保险制度，劳动保护，生活条件和教育都在改进着。工业工人和办公室的雇员可以在休养所、疗养院得到医药治疗。他们的孩子可以送进托儿所、中学和大学。对劳动人民的这种关心，在资本主义国家是不可能的。
    为了加强工人阶级和其他劳动人民特别是和劳动农民的连系，职工会支持了贫农中农在土地改革和其他生活利益的斗争。职工会在争取工业化和创建新的农业技术的斗争的胜利中，在帮助贫农、中农建立合作社，并支持他们对富农的斗争中，是农村过渡到社会主义斗争的重要武器。
    这里必须指出在新民主主义国家中，职工会所进行的教育与动员群众向反动势力——正在力图钻这些国家的暂时困难的空子的剥削分子和寄生虫们——作斗争的胜利的工作。
    在这一问题上捷克职工会提供了最明显的例子。在“二月的日子”，以它们的纲领和要求，职工会在共产党的领导下站在前面，鼓励了工人的总罢工，这一罢工是以广大群众的完全胜利而结束的。
