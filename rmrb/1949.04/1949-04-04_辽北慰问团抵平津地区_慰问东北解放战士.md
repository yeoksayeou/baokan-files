Liaobei慰问团 Arrives in the Tianjin-Beijing Area to Comfort Northeast Liberated Soldiers

[Reported by this newspaper] Since the Northeast People's Liberation Army entered the customs, the vast people of Northeast China have been constantly concerned about the health and new victories of their sons and brothers. Seven million people in Liaobei Province specially organized a frontline慰问团 (comfort delegation), led by Mayor Chen of Siping City and others, to travel more than two thousand li (miles) and arrive at the PLA garrison in the Tianjin-Beijing area a few days ago. The Political Department of a certain army of the Northeast People's Liberation Army immediately held a meeting to express a warm welcome. The sentence everyone had been looking forward to, "Go to Beiping to comfort you!" has been realized today. At the welcoming meeting, delegation representatives Dean Yu and Mayor Chen both spoke, explaining the hopes of the people of Northeast China for their sons and brothers, and encouraging everyone to fight to the south of the Yangtze River as soon as possible to liberate all of China. They also gave a detailed introduction to the preferential treatment of revolutionary servicemen's families in the rear. Dean Yu said, "Although the people of Northeast China have already been liberated, they still eagerly hope that you will cross the Yangtze River as soon as possible and liberate the southern half of China. This is the ardent desire of the people of Northeast China and the only hope of the people of Liaobei for you!" In Mayor Chen's speech, he first introduced the flourishing recovery and development of industry and commerce in Northeast China, telling everyone that the people of Northeast China will use all their strength to support the battle to liberate the south of the Yangtze River. Then he said, "The work of giving preferential treatment to families of servicemen in the rear has been raised to a considerably important position. Preferential treatment committees have been organized in various places to specifically handle the work of servicemen's families and help them solve difficulties in various aspects; as for comrades who have come over from the liberated areas to join the People's Liberation Army, they also enjoy the same treatment as revolutionary servicemen's families. I hope that comrades can rest assured to go south to kill the enemy, and the people of Jiangnan are looking forward to you liberating them every day." The deputy director of the Political Department of the army delivered a speech at the meeting, calling on everyone to prepare to go south and assuring the Liaobei慰问团 (comfort delegation) that they would resolutely answer the consolation of the people of Liaobei by fighting to the south of the Yangtze River and liberating all of China.
