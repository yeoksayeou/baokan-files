　　Martyr Zhao Quanlin
  　Posthumously Rehabilitated
  　Beijing Municipal People's Government to Provide Compensation

    [Report from this newspaper] Tu Zhaolanlin, a relative of martyr, recently sent a letter to the North China People's Government, reporting on the deeds of her brother, martyr Zhao Quanlin, during his lifetime. The North China People's Government immediately ordered the Beijing Municipal People's Government to investigate. According to the investigation, Comrade Zhao Quanlin was from Tongzhou and came from a poor background. He was very filial to his mother. He worked in the typesetting department of the Jinghua Printing Bureau in Beiping, initially as an apprentice. Due to his intelligence and diligent self-study, he was promoted to head of the Western Character Section. He was quiet and reserved, and his writing was elegant, earning him respect from his colleagues. In 1922 or 1923, he joined the Chinese Communist Party and engaged in workers' movements. In 1925, he was dismissed by the factory for "unhealthy thoughts." He then went to Hankou, and in 1927, he returned to Beiping to serve as the chairman of the Beijing General Labor Union. In September of the same year, he was arrested for leading a strike by workers on the Ping-Sui Railway. On the first day of the tenth lunar month of the same year, he was shot by reactionaries at Tianqiao. His wife buried him in the Zhao family graveyard in Zhoujiacun, Shilihe, outside Shaguomen. A total of ten men and women were killed at the same time.

    Under the long rule of the reactionary government, the Communist Party and the revolutionary government, although wanting to care for his family, were unable to do so. Someone was sent to prepare to raise his young son, Zhao Zeng, but the harsh environment prevented it. He has been wandering outside for many years and there is no news of him. The only one in Beiping is his sister, Tu Zhaolanlin. The Beijing Municipal People's Government, in addition to providing compensation as soon as there is news of Zhao Zeng, also sent personnel to express condolences to Tu Zhaolanlin yesterday.

    [Report from this newspaper] Zhao Tong, a patriotic youth from Beiping who was shot by the Kuomintang reactionaries in Taiwan on March 22, 1947, will be posthumously recognized as a martyr by the Beijing Municipal People's Government. Zhao Tong was from Beiping and studied at the China College. In the summer of 1946, he joined the Taiwan Innovation Comrades Association's Cultural and Educational Service Group and went to Taiwan, where he taught at Yilan Middle School. He was enthusiastic, forthright, fair, and upright, deeply loved by students and local elders. In addition to teaching, he used his salary to reward students and volunteered to tutor local Taiwanese people in Mandarin in his spare time. In his family letters, he said, "I will spare no effort to do anything that benefits others," and "I would rather die for righteousness than live for profit." Therefore, he united students and their parents, instilling correct ideas in them. The school principal, Li Zushou, a Kuomintang secret agent, accused Zhao Tong of being a "troublemaker" during the "February 28th Incident" and had him arrested by the Kuomintang bandits on March 18, 1947. He was brutally murdered on March 22nd on the southern coast and his body was thrown into the sea. He was only twenty-four years old. Later, local people salvaged and buried him. His students were even more indignant and sent letters demanding revenge for him. The Taiwan Fellow Association in Beiping also hosted reporters, demanding justice, but under the oppression of the reactionary government, there were no results. After the liberation of Beiping, relevant personnel reported to the Ping Municipal People's Government, and after investigation, the facts were confirmed. He will be posthumously recognized as a martyr and compensation will be provided. Zhao Tong is only one of the countless patriotic martyrs who were brutally murdered by the Kuomintang reactionaries, unjustly dying under the bloody hands of the reactionary regime. Only the People's Government can give the deceased such glorious treatment, and people can see the significant difference between the two regimes from this.

### 烈士赵铨林同志　罹难得昭雪　北平市人民政府将补予抚恤

　　烈士赵铨林同志
  　罹难得昭雪
  　北平市人民政府将补予抚恤
    【本报讯】烈士亲属屠赵兰林顷函呈华北人民政府，报告其兄烈士赵铨林生前事迹。华北人民政府立令北平市人民政府调查，据调查所得，赵铨林同志通州人，出身贫苦，事母至孝，曾服务于北平京华印书局排字房，初充学徒，以天资聪颖，自修苦学，得升任西字科长，为人沉静寡言，文墨秀丽，为同仁所推重，于民国十一二年参加中国共产党，从事工人工作，于民国十四年被厂方以“思想不良”开除，旋赴汉口，于民国十六年回平任北京总工会会长，九月间因领导平绥路工人罢工被捕。同年旧历十月初一日为反动派枪杀于天桥，由其妻埋葬于沙锅门外十里河周家村赵家坟内。同时罹难者男女共十名。
    在长久的反动政权统治之下，共产党及革命政府，虽欲照顾其家属，亦无法实现，曾派人准备教养其幼子赵曾，卒以环境恶劣，未克成功。现已多年流亡在外，并无音信，在北平者仅有其妹屠赵兰林。北平市人民政府，除俟赵曾一有消息即行补予抚恤外，昨并派员慰问屠赵兰林。

    【本报讯】三十六年三月二十二日被国民党反动派在台湾枪杀之北平籍爱国青年赵桐，即将被北平市人民政府追认为烈士。赵桐，北平人，中国学院肄业，于三十五年夏参加台湾革新同志会文教服务团赴台，于宜兰中学任教。为人热心爽直，秉公亮节，深得学生及当地父老之爱戴。他除担任教课外，并以薪金奖励同学，业余为当地台人义务补习国语，他在其家书中说：“凡利人之事，无不举全力以赴”，“宁为义死，不做利生”，因此他团结了学生及其家长，为他们灌输正确的思想。该校校长国民党特务分子李祖寿，于“二二八”事变时，加赵桐以“捣乱分子”的“罪名”，于三十六年三月十八日被国民党匪帮逮捕，于三月二十二日惨杀于南方海岸，投尸海中。时年仅二十四岁。后经当地民众打捞埋葬。其学生更为义愤，纷函要为他复仇，台湾旅平同乡会亦曾招待记者，要求申冤，然而在反动派政权压迫之下，并无结果。北平解放后，经有关人士向平市人民政府报告，调查属实，即将追认其为烈士。并予抚恤。赵桐只不过是无数惨遭国民党反动派杀害的爱国志士之一，屈死于反动派政权的罪恶血手之下，只有人民政府才对死者予以如此光荣的待遇，人们从此更可看出两种政权的显著分别。
