　　To Strengthen Transportation, Tianjin-Beijing Railway Bureau Replaces Decayed Railroad Ties
　　"May 1st" to Resume Tianjin-Beijing Direct Express Train
　　[This newspaper reports] To strengthen transportation, facilitate commerce and the people, ensure safe train operation, and increase train speed, the Tianjin-Beijing Railway Bureau is currently making its best effort to replace decayed railroad ties. The North China Railway had not been repaired since two years before Japan's surrender and during the Kuomintang's rule after the surrender. Over the past five years, the railroad ties have been severely damaged. Since the People's Government has actively carried out repairs, the Tianjin-Beijing Railway has completed the replacement of more than 50,000 old railroad ties, accounting for about one-third of the railroad ties that need to be repaired. The railway bureau also proposed more than ten days ago to ensure the punctual operation of passenger trains and improve dispatching and operation methods, which has now achieved significant results. Since April 1st, passenger trains have been almost entirely on time, except for individual special reasons. The railway bureau is also calling for the achievement of punctual freight trains in late April, and plans to resume the Tianjin-Beijing direct special express train on May 1st, guaranteeing arrival in two hours and twenty-seven minutes for the entire journey. It is expected that in two or three months, the train speed will exceed the level during the Kuomintang period.

　　平津铁路局为加强运输
    撤换铁路朽毁枕木
  　“五一”恢复平津直达快车
    【本报讯】平津铁路局为加强运输，便利商民，保障行车安全，提高行车速度，刻正以最大努力撤换朽毁的枕木。华北铁路自日本投降前二年以及投降后国民党统治时期，即未稍加整修。五年来枕木已毁坏不堪。经人民政府积极整修以来，平津铁路已完成撤换旧枕木五万余根，约为需要整修枕木的三分之一。该路局更于十余日前提出旅客列车正点运行，改善调度及行车方法，现已获得显著成效。四月一日起，旅客列车除个别特殊原因外，几已全部正点。该路局更号召于四月下旬，实现货车正点，并拟于五月一日起恢复平津直达特别快车，全程二小时二十七分保证抵达。预计在两三个月以后，超过国民党时期行车速度的水准。
