　　Gaocheng Station Speeds Up Loading and Unloading

　　[Shijiazhuang News] The work of the loading and unloading workers at Gaocheng Station on the Shide Railway has greatly improved. Previously, the work of the workers at the station was very disorganized, the organization was poor, and some individual workers even made things difficult for merchants. Recently, a joint meeting was held by the station staff and the local government, as well as the loading and unloading worker group leaders, to discuss solutions together. After the meeting, the trade union strengthened the education of the workers, and the loading and unloading work has been progressing daily. For example, on February 20th, twenty-one coal cars were used for train 206, including twelve 30-ton cars and nine 40-ton cars, which were unloaded in 45 minutes. According to the transportation regulations, the general shunting time is six hours, especially since the railway bureau currently has few vehicles. Unloading in advance allows the vehicles to be hauled away earlier, increasing transportation capacity. The station is very pleased with the workers' active work and the stationmaster wrote a letter to the railway bureau to commend them.

　　藁城车站装卸加速
    【石家庄讯】石德路藁城车站装卸工人工作，大有改进。以前该站工人工作很乱，组织较差，甚至有个别工人刁难客商。近经车站工作人员和当地政府、装卸工人组长开联席会议，共同商量办法。会后由工会加强对工人的教育，装卸工作日见进步。如二月二十日二○六次列车用煤车二十一辆，其中三十吨的十二辆，四十吨的九辆，四十五分钟就卸完了。按运输规章规定，一般甩车时间是六小时，特别目前路局车辆少，提前卸完，就可以提早把车辆挂走，增加运输。该站对于工人们这样积极工作，非常高兴，站长特写信报告路局表扬他们。
