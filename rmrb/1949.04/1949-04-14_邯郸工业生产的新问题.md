Editor's Note: With the liberation of Tianjin and Beijing, new changes have taken place in the relationship between urban and rural areas, and small and medium-sized cities have also changed accordingly. The problems encountered in Handan's industrial production will also occur elsewhere. This is a new problem, and we provide it for research by all relevant parties.

The legs of commodities are moving very fast due to convenient transportation. When the reporter arrived in Handan on March 12th, the products of Tianjin factories had already appeared on the market. Sunshine and Wufu brand cotton cloth, twisted strips, towels, and socks made using semi-finished products, and even Yimu Gao and Qifeng San from a certain pharmacy in Beiping, were quietly displayed on high shelves, Their quantities were not yet large, but they were very attractive to customers.

The reporter visited the city's cotton, iron, and other factories and found new changes: of the city's cotton weaving factories, which numbered fourteen at the end of last year, only seven are now open, with only twenty-three of sixty-four machines in operation; women's thread winding handicrafts are also being sold at low prices; twisted strip factories have also lost their former eager customers, and the iron smelting furnaces of several iron factories have also stopped. The manager of the state-owned Hengtai Cotton Weaving Factory wants to close down, saying, "I can't keep losing money!" Indeed, at the same price, customers would of course prefer to buy Tianjin goods with even lines and beautiful dyeing. As a result, some factories had weeks where they couldn't sell a single bolt of cloth. When women cadres of the Municipal Party Committee mobilized women to produce, the women said, "What are you asking us to produce?..." A series of difficulties were raised, which the cadres could not solve; they then went to promote a certain weaving factory to lead women's labor, but the factory raised issues such as funds and sales to the cadres, which also could not be solved. Therefore, some cadres, although disagreeing with the closure of some factories, lacked concrete measures and persuasiveness. Most felt "stuck with losing money, difficult to switch to other industries" and felt mentally depressed.

	The arrival of goods from Tianjin and Beijing has brought new changes to Handan factories.

With the liberation of Tianjin and Beijing, the relationship between urban and rural areas in North China has changed. Large-scale machine products are used to supply the countryside with relatively high-quality and low-priced goods; farmers also demand the use of inexpensive and high-quality commodities and more scientifically advanced means of production. This makes it impossible for the industries in cities between large cities and the countryside (such as Handan) - small-scale machine factories as the backbone and a large number of decentralized handicraft family sideline productions - not to undergo drastic changes. In such cities, what to develop in industry? How to develop it? Has become a new issue to be solved urgently in the new environment. Therefore, there must be a clear direction and new ways to enable the industrial production of these cities to continue to develop.

Handan's industry relies on the abundant coal production in Ci County, Wu'an, Fengfeng and other places, and the cotton production in the vast rural areas. In terms of transportation, there are the Pinghan, Hanshe (County), and Hanguan (Tao) railways, and it is also located upstream of the Fuyang River transport, making import and export transportation extremely convenient. These are all favorable conditions for Handan to develop light industry. Before liberation, Handan's industry was almost completely destroyed by the Japanese invaders. Until after liberation in the 34th year of the Republic of China, under the correct policies of our party and the active efforts of the working masses, and with the leadership's support for small producers, industrial production achieved new development. In the past three years, under the sabotage of the Kuomintang bandit army's spying and the indiscriminate bombing by Chiang and the US, state-owned factories such as electric lights, gristmills, printing, cotton weaving, pharmaceuticals, and nitrate sulfur were successively restored and developed. Public and private factories such as ironworks, chemicals, medicinal materials, and civil construction were established, as well as more than 500 handicraft workshops such as blacksmiths, weavers and dyers, chalk, cigarettes, lithography, alkali making, and leather. According to statistics at the end of 1948: In addition to state-owned industries, there were a total of 1,155 public and private factories and workshops in 27 categories, with a capital of 890 million yuan and 3,500 employees. Industrial workers alone accounted for more than 10% of the city's total population. Production was developed, the War of Liberation was supported, and the people were supplied with a large amount of production and living materials.

But it is undeniable that the liberation of Tianjin and Beijing has had a very obvious impact on Handan's industrial production. However, rooted in the needs of the vast people, and with the strong strength of state-owned and public-owned enterprises, this city of the people, under the correct leadership of the Party, can quickly return to normal. They are now groping forward.

	What kind of industry should Handan develop, being situated between large cities and the countryside? How to develop it?

Faced with this new situation, the Municipal Party Committee studied and analyzed the current objective conditions and believed that after we already have large cities and large-scale machine production and transportation is becoming more and more convenient, Handan is now in a position to connect large cities and the countryside. Therefore, it must engage in the production of finished products that cannot be replaced by large machines to supply the countryside, and manufacture semi-finished products to supply the cities, so that production can have a way out. Today's industrial production must improve technology, improve quality, and sell at small profits and large volumes. Regarding what to develop? It is believed that: First, we must develop the production of local raw materials and technologies in order to achieve low costs through sufficient raw materials and high technology in order to achieve brisk sales; Secondly, special handicrafts that large machines cannot temporarily replace can also be developed. Second, obtain raw materials locally and manufacture semi-finished products to supply large cities. Regarding how to develop it? For the existing various industries, the raw material markets were studied separately, the costs were calculated, and it was recognized which had a future, which had a temporary future and no future, and which needed to improve quality and research improvement. After research, it was realized that there is absolutely no product glut at present, but supply falls short of demand. Even the cotton weaving industry, which is most affected in this city, still has a future if it truly improves quality and sells at small profits and large volumes.

After groping for the past twenty days, various public and private factories have undergone the following transformations: (1) Tongren Public Cooperative established an egg-breaking factory. (2) Ten iron factories, including Taimao and Daxin, switched from manufacturing wind bows and carts to contracting to build hundreds of waterwheels for the Jinnan Water Conservancy Promotion Society. (3) Hengtai Cotton Weaving Factory determined the business policy of selling at small profits and large volumes, even without profits (how to continue operating without profits? - Editor), and set up a sales department in Changzhi. The above points provide a new direction for the city's industrial production. For example, the establishment of an egg-breaking factory, the industry has sufficient local raw materials and technology, making semi-finished products to supply large cities, and will greatly stimulate the development of rural sideline occupations.

	Industrial production has a future only when it is closely integrated with the needs of farmers.

Taimao Daxin Iron Factory turned to contracting to make waterwheels, which are currently very much needed for agricultural production increase, and saw the future. These all pointed out the manufacturing direction of various industries. We must closely integrate with the production needs of farmers and cannot forget that Handan's industry has developed along this path. Hengtai's method of delivering goods to Changzhi and Taimao's method of contracting orders put forward a solution in sales. Secondly, the Bureau of Industry and Commerce plans to hold a cotton weaving industry seminar to educate cadres and producers with examples. For example, some factories' products have sales because they are beautifully dyed and durable, while some factories' products have no sales at all, so as to promote the industry forward.

After initially groping for experience, it does not mean that all problems have been solved. For example, the handicrafts of the vast number of urban women still have no way out, and the machines of many iron and cotton weaving factories have not yet recovered to their original numbers, some small factories still have no sales, some factories have lowered wages, and even the phenomenon of a private cotton weaving factory detaining wages, causing workers to drink porridge and starve away has occurred. The vast number of handicraft workshops and small producers are still engaged in decentralized and blind production. But on the other hand, there are not many tools on the market that are greatly needed in agriculture in the vast countryside. Is this because industrial production "has no way out"?

In fact, the city's industrial production situation has not undergone fundamental changes to date. The problem obviously cannot be solved spontaneously, and prolonged delays will cause more losses to production, and the leadership will become more passive. Therefore, educating cadres and clearly emphasizing the direction of production development, in order to improve cadres, clarify the business direction under the view of concentrating on the development of industrial production, and promote the city's production, this is an arduous and meticulous task. How to lead the diverse small producers to gradually develop towards centralization through the organization of production cooperation, and at the same time supplement them with state-owned leadership, is still very lacking in the current specific work. In addition, some also need to carry out ideological and material conversion preparations, which also require educating cadres and the masses. Today, strengthening state-owned industrial production (such as establishing an egg-breaking factory), unifying and organizing forces and leading private industries in industrial production, and combining urban labor are very important tasks. For acts that damage production and illegally infringe on the welfare of employees for profit, appropriate criticism and punishment should be given. In this way, the Municipal Party Committee needs to closely grasp the current problems in the leadership of industrial production, and on the basis of the experience already gained, move forward again, overcome the temporary chaos caused by insufficient preparation, and promote production to return to the path of development.

　　邯郸工业生产的新问题
    本报记者  苏幼民
    编者按：平津解放，城乡关系发生了新变化，中小城市也随着发生了变化。邯郸市工业生产所遇到的问题，在其他地方也将会发生。这是一个新的问题，特提供各有关方面研究。
    商品的腿由于交通便利的原因，就显得非常之快，当三月十二日记者到邯郸时，天津工厂的出品，早已在市场出现了。阳光、五福牌洋布，利用半成品制造的绞条、毛巾袜子，连北平某药行的益母膏、脐风散，也已安静的摆在高脚货架上，其数量虽还不多，但对顾客们却很有吸引力。
    记者访问了该市棉、铁等工厂，发现也有了新的变化：计全市棉织厂去年底为十四户，现仅有七户开门，六十四台机子仅开动二十三台；妇女们的络线手工，也在廉价求售；风弓绞条制造厂也失去了以往争购的主顾，几家铁厂的冶铁风炉亦已停止。公营恒太棉织厂经理要歇业，他说：“不能再赔下去！”的确，同样价格，顾客们当然愿意买线条匀净染色漂亮的天津货。这样有些厂曾有一星期一匹布也卖不出去的。市委的妇女干部在动员妇女生产时，妇女们说：“叫俺生产什么呀？……”困难提出了一连串，干部无法解决；又去推动某织厂要带动妇女劳动，工厂却向干部提出资金、销路等问题，又是不能解决。因而有的干部虽不同意某些工厂歇业，但也缺乏具体办法和说服力。大部认为“守着赔本，转业困难”，思想上感到苦闷。
    　　　　平津的货物到邯郸工厂发生了新变化
    随着平津解放，华北城乡关系有了变化。大机器产品以相对的质高价廉物品来供给农村；农民也要求使用价廉物美的商品和较科学进步的生产资料。这就使得处于大城市与乡村之间的城市（如邯郸）的工业——小规模的机器工厂为骨干与大量的分散的手工业家庭副业的生产，不能不起着急剧的变化。在这样的城市中，在工业上发展什么？如何发展？就成了新环境下急待解决的新课题。因之须有明确的方向，开辟新的途径，才能使这些城市的工业生产继续发展。
    邯郸的工业，依托磁县、武安、峰峰等地丰富的煤产与广大农村的棉产，交通上有平汉、邯涉（县）、邯馆（陶）等铁路，又当滏阳河运上游，出入运输极方便，这都是邯郸发展轻工业的有利条件。解放前，邯郸工业为日寇摧残殆尽，直至民国三十四年解放后，在我党正确方针及工人群众的积极努力下，又加领导上对小生产者的多方扶植，工业生产获得新的发展。三年来在国民党匪军窥伺、蒋美机滥炸等破坏下，先后恢复发展了电灯、火磨，设立了印刷、棉织、制药、硝磺等国营工厂，开设了铁工、化学、药材、土木建筑等公私营工厂，以及铁匠、织染、粉笔、卷烟、石印、制碱、皮革等五百余户手工作坊。据一九四八年年底统计：除国营工业外，公私工厂作坊共有二十七种一千一百五十五户，资金八亿九千万元，职工三千五百人，只产业工人即占全市总人口百分之十强。发展了生产，支援了解放战争，供给了人民大量的生产生活资料。
    但是无可讳言，平津解放给予邯郸工业生产的影响是很明显的。但植根于广大人民的需要，有着国营公营的雄厚力量的这个人民的城市，在党的正确领导下依靠人民是可能很快走上正常状态的。现在他们正摸索着前进。
    　　　　处在大城市与乡村间的邯郸发展什么工业？如何发展？
    面临着这种新的情况，市委研究分析了当前的客观条件，认为在我们已有了大城市大机器生产，交通日趋方便之后，邯郸已处在大城市与乡村联接点的地位上，因此必须从事大机器所不能代替的成品生产以供给农村，并制造半成品以供给城市，生产才能有出路。现在的工业生产，更必须是改进技术，提高质量，薄利广销。关于发展什么？认为：一、要发展本地有原料有技术的生产，以原料足技术高达到成本低以求得畅销；其次大机器在目前暂不能代替的特种手工业亦可发展。二、就地取给原料，制造半成品，供给大城市。关于如何发展？对现有各种产业，分别研究了原料市场，计算了成本高低，分别认识了哪是有前途、哪是暂时有前途将来没有前途的，哪些需要提高质量研究改进的，经研究认识目前绝不是产品充斥，而是供不应求，即如本市所感到最受影响的棉织业，若真正做到改进质量薄利广销，仍是有前途的。
    经过二十天来的摸索，各公私工厂有如下的转变：（一）同仁公营合作社设立打蛋厂。（二）太茂大新等十家铁工厂由制造风弓轧车，转到承造冀南水利推进社的百辆水车。（三）恒太棉织厂确定薄利广销到甚至没利广销（无利如何继续经营？——编者）的营业方针，并于长治设门市部。以上几点，为全市工业生产提出了新的方向。如打蛋厂的设立，该业在本地原料足、有技术，制成半成品供给大城市，且会大大刺激农村副业开展。
    　　　　紧紧结合农民需要工业生产才有前途
    太茂大新铁厂，转到承做目前农业增产非常需要的水车，看见了前途。这些都指出了各业制造方向，必须紧紧结合农民的生产需要，不能忘记邯郸的工业是由这条道路上发展起来的。恒太货运长治和太茂承订货物的办法，是在销售上提出了办法。其次工商局计划举办棉织业座谈会，以实例教育干部与生产者，如有的厂出品因染色漂亮质地耐用而有销路，有的厂出品就全部没销路，以此推动该业前进。
    在初步摸取了经验之后，还不等于问题的全部解决。如当前广大市民妇女的手工仍无出路，不少的铁工、棉织等工厂的机器仍未恢复到原来的数目，某些小型工厂仍无销路，某些工厂压低了工资，甚至还出现某私营棉织厂扣押工资，让工人喝稀饭饿走了工人的现象，广大的手工业作坊小生产者，仍在分散的盲目的生产。但在另一方面，为广大乡村农业上大量需要的工具，市场上却还不算多。这难道是工业生产“没有门路”吗？
    实际全市的工业生产的状况，至今并未有基本的改变。问题显然不能自发地解决，拖长时间将会使生产受到更多的损失，领导更陷于被动，因此教育干部，明确强调发展生产的方向，以提高干部，在集中发展工业生产的观点下明确业务方向，推进全市生产，这是一个艰苦细致的任务。对多样的小生产者，如何以生产合作的组织，领导他们逐渐向集中发展，同时辅之以国营的领导，这在目前的具体工作中尚十分缺乏。另有些还须进行思想的物质的转业准备，这亦须教育干部与群众。今天壮大公营工业生产（如建立打蛋厂），在工业生产中统一组织发挥力量与带领私营工业，结合市民劳力，是十分重要的工作。对于因利润而破坏生产非法侵犯职工福利的行为，应给予适当的批评与处分，如此就须要市委对工业生产的领导上紧紧掌握当前发生的问题，在既经获得的经验基础上，再向前进，克服因准备不足而造成的暂时的混乱，推动生产重新走向发展的道路。
