Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 20th—The long-brewing British Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference will begin on the 21st in London. The prime ministers of British dominions such as Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, India, Ceylon, and Pakistan have arrived in Britain in recent days. Sources indicate that the central agenda of the conference is the issue of establishing a Far East branch of the North Atlantic Treaty, namely a Pacific Pact, and assisting reactionary elements in colonial countries to suppress local national liberation struggles. The organizers of the conference want to conceal the true purpose of the meeting, claiming that the conference is solely for discussing the relationship between India and the British Commonwealth after India formally declares "independence" in the future. New Zealand Prime Minister Fraser falsely claimed on the 14th that he "did not believe that the British Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference in London would consider a Pacific defense pact." But at the same time, this Fraser had advocated on January 9th of this year in Ottawa for the establishment of a Pacific military agreement with the participation of the United States, claiming that this was currently "a rather important issue," and revealed that the British Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference last autumn had discussed the issue of Pacific "joint defense" (United Press).

Since the close of the British Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference last autumn, the British Labour government has followed American reactionaries in carrying out a series of war-provoking activities. In the Far East, it has signed a secret anti-communist agreement with Siam, intensified the persecution of overseas Chinese in Malaya and the people of Hong Kong, incited upper-class elements of the Karen people in Burma to carry out rebellions, and encouraged the Indian government to attack the people. It supports the reactionary policies of the United States towards Indonesia and Vietnam. The recent activities of British High Commissioner to Malaya MacDonald, Conservative Deputy Party Leader Eden, and Cabinet Envoy MacDonald in various parts of the Far East regarding the conclusion of a Pacific Pact are closely related to the upcoming conference.

　　阴谋订太平洋侵略公约
  　英联邦总理会议将在伦敦举行
    【新华社北平二十日电】酝酿已久的英联邦总理会议将于二十一日在伦敦开始举行。澳大利亚、新西兰、南非、印度锡兰、巴基斯坦等英自治领总理已于近数日内陆续抵英。各方消息，显示会议的中心议题是关于订立北大西洋公约的远东支脉即太平洋公约问题，和协助各殖民地国家的反动分子镇压当地的民族解放斗争问题，会议组织者想掩盖会议的真实目的，声言会议是专为讨论印度将来正式宣布“独立”后与英联邦的关系。新西兰总理福莱塞曾于十四日佯称他“不相信伦敦不列颠联邦各国总理会议会考虑太平洋防御公约”。但同时这个福莱塞，曾在本年一月九日在渥太华鼓吹成立有美国参加的太平洋军事协定，声称这在目前“乃一颇为重大的问题”，并透露去秋英联邦总理会议即曾讨论过太平洋“联防”问题（合众社）。
    自去秋英联邦总理会议闭会以来，英工党政府曾追随美国反动派，进行了一系列挑拨战争的活动。在远东方面，曾订立英暹反共密约，加紧迫害马来亚华侨和香港人民，唆使缅甸克仑族上层分子进行叛乱，鼓励印度政府向人民进攻。支持美国对印尼与越南的反动政策。英驻马来亚高级专员麦克唐纳，保守党副党魁艾登与内阁专使麦斯多威尔近来在远东各地进行的关于订立太平洋公约的活动等，都与即将举行的会议有密切关系。
