　　Resolutely Eliminate the "Living Yama"
　　Old brother, please listen carefully:
　　The bandit Yan is a man-eating demon,
　　Ruling Shanxi for forty years,
　　Ruining the country and harming the people to the extreme.
　　People curse him as the "Living Yama,"
　　Countless tricks to harm people:
　　"Soldier-Farmer Unity" cleverly conscripts,
　　Conscripting the younger brother and then the older brother;
　　Land at home lies uncultivated,
　　Even a little grain is "confiscated";
　　"Self-confession and Rebirth" takes lives,
　　Relentless with clubs and guillotines.
　　Nine out of ten families are empty,
　　Making it impossible for the people to survive,
　　If you want to know the people's secrets,
　　Stay and ask the old folks.
　　Our armies are joining forces,
　　Capturing Taiyuan city in one fell swoop,
　　Resolutely eliminate the "Living Yama,"
　　Dig up the old root of disaster in Shanxi.

　　坚决消灭“活阎王”
    老大哥，请细听：
    阎贼是个吃人精，
    统治山西四十年，
    祸国殃民坏透顶。
    人都骂他“活阎王”，
    害人花样数不清：
    “兵农合一”巧抓丁，
    抓走弟弟又抓兄；
    家有土地没人种，
    有点粮食也“充公”；
    “自白转生”要人命，
    乱棍铡刀不留情。
    十家就有九家空，
    害得百姓活不成，
    你们要想知民底细，
    住下问问老百姓。
    咱们军队大会合，
    一举打下太原城，
    坚决消灭“活阎王”，
    挖掉山西老祸根。
