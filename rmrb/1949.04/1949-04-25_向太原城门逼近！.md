　　Approaching the Gates of Taiyuan!
    Zhang Lei
    As dusk approached, the troops set out for the front lines. They had received orders from higher authorities to launch an attack on the enemy defenses outside Taiyuan at dawn tomorrow.
    In the setting sun, the faces of every soldier reflected a brilliant light. Each harbored an unwavering belief in victory, striding towards the city of Taiyuan. Here, in Huangling Village, in the second outer district of Taiyuan, about twenty li from the city, the main north-south street in the village center, which had been cleaned up by the soldiers, was teeming with an endless stream of victorious troops. The infantry passed, followed closely by artillery vehicles. Transport team members cracked their whips, urging on the lazy mules pulling carts laden with ammunition. The cooks carried not only their field kitchens and oil drums but also chopped firewood. To ensure that the heroic soldiers fighting on the front lines had plenty to eat, they also carried bean sprouts and freshly made tofu. The vast numbers of civilian laborers and stretcher teams from Jinzhong, Ji'nan, and Ji'zhong also advanced step by step with the troops! "Go win a great victory!" "Liberate Taiyuan and achieve more merits!" The spirited, steel-like army, like a mighty torrent, was approaching the dark, deathly, and sinful prison city—Taiyuan!
    An hour before the troops set off, I visited soldiers Li Derong of the 7th Company of a certain regiment, as well as Deputy Squad Leader Song Yuhai, Liu Jinbin, and Wang Shichun. They all proudly took out their merit plans from their pockets to show me. Song Yuhai and Wang Shichun were new comrades who had only been liberated from the Kuomintang army during the Pingjin Campaign. On the way from Beiping to the Taiyuan front, the troops received an infinitely warm welcome and send-off from the people of the liberated areas. "Soldiers are actually welcomed by the people!" This surprised Song Yuhai. He began to feel honored, saying, "The people are so good to the People's Liberation Army. Comrades along the way rushed to carry my things for me, asking if I was cold or hungry, treating me better than their own brothers. I must earn merit this time when we fight in Taiyuan!" I looked at his merit plan, which was written in crooked pencil: "Fear no sacrifice, resolutely complete the mission," "If a comrade is wounded, I must rescue him..." In just three months, the people's support for the People's Liberation Army and the noble class solidarity within the People's Liberation Army educated Comrade Song Yuhai, making him a true revolutionary soldier.
    Liu Quanbin is a machine gunner with bright eyes. To complete the plan to cover the infantry's safe demolition work, he had been practicing aiming day and night for several days, to the point where his eyes were bloodshot. He said modestly, "During the live ammunition exercise last time, my machine gun kept acting up, and the bullets only landed to the left and right of the pillbox's firing slit. But some of us have already managed to shoot machine gun bullets into the firing slit from a distance of two hundred and fifty meters. I was so anxious. I practiced during the day and practiced at night, and now I've finally made some progress." As he said this, he breathed a sigh of relief, revealing innocent joy.
    Deputy Squad Leader Li Derong is a veteran soldier, but he is only in his twenties. He wants to compete with other squads for victory, and he personally taught the new comrades demolition techniques. "The higher-ups called on us to fight well, receive well, and hand over well when we attack Taiyuan. Therefore, we not only conducted combat exercises, but we also asked the company commander and instructor to register each person's private belongings, ensuring that we bring as many things into Taiyuan as we take out of the city afterward."
    "Why do you do that?"
    Comrade Li Derong replied without hesitation, "Because after liberation, Taiyuan will belong to the people."
    Wang Shichun is even younger, only twenty-two years old. His home is in Zhuoshui County, and he was conscripted into the Kuomintang army last spring. He was liberated by our army in the Xinbao'an battle. He speaks frankly and cheerfully, "Arriving in the People's Liberation Army is like arriving home. My parents wrote to me, telling me to resolutely fight the reactionaries and carry the revolution through to the end. This time, fighting in Taiyuan is the first time I've truly fought the enemy. I plan to earn a merit, and my family is waiting for news of my accomplishment."
    The assembly call sounded, and they habitually saluted goodbye. "See you in Taiyuan City!" In the blink of an eye, four strong figures immediately leaped into their own company.
    Everyone striving to earn merit is the morale of the People's Liberation Army advancing courageously on the Taiyuan front.

　　向太原城门逼近！
    张磊
    将近黄昏的时候，部队向第一线阵地出发了，他们已经奉到上级命令，准备明天拂晓向太原外围守敌发起攻击。
    夕阳光下，每个战士的脸上，反映出灿烂的光辉，谁都怀着一个必胜的信念，大踏步向太原城下迈进：这儿是太原市外二区黄陵村，离城二十里，被战士们打扫得干干净净的村中心南北大街上，一队一队的胜利之师，正在络绎不绝地通过，步兵过去了，炮车也紧接追上去，运输队员押着满车炮弹的大车扬鞭吆喝偷懒的骡子，炊事员同志不但背着行军锅，担着油桶，并且还担着劈好了的木柴，为了使火线上英勇杀敌的战士们多多吃饭，他们还挑上了绿豆牙和新作的豆腐。来自晋中、冀南、冀中的广大民工、提架队，他们也随着部队，逐步推进！“打胜仗去！”“ 解放太原城再立功！”斗志昂扬的钢铁的队伍象一支巨流向黑暗死亡罪恶的牢狱之城——太原逼近了！
    部队出发前的一小时，我访问了某团七连战士李德荣、副班长宋玉海、刘金宾、王世春，他们都骄傲地从怀里拿出立功计划给我看。宋玉海、王世春都是平津战役中才从国民党军队解放过来的新同志，从北平到太原前线，部队沿途受到了解放区人民无限热情的欢迎和欢送。“当兵还有老百姓欢迎！”这使宋玉海出于意外的惊奇，他开始感到光荣，他说：“老百姓对解放军这样好，同志们一路抢着给我背东西，问寒问暖，待我比亲兄弟还亲，这次打太原我非要立功不行！”我翻看他的立功计划，歪歪扭扭的铅笔字这样写着：“不怕牺牲坚决完成任务”“如若同志负伤我一定要把他抢救下来……”短短三个月时间，人民拥护解放军和解放军内部高贵的阶级友爱，教育了宋玉海同志，使他真正成为一个革命军人。
    刘全宾是机构射手，他有一对明亮的大眼，为要完成掩护步兵安全爆破的计划，几天来他日夜练习瞄准，以致眼白浮上了血丝，他很谦虚的说：“上次实弹演习，我的机构尽和我闹别扭，子弹光落在碉堡的枪眼左右，可是我们已经有人从二百五十公尺距离把机枪子弹打进枪眼里去了。我着急的不行。白天练，黑夜练，现在总算是进步了一点。”说到这里，他松了一口气，现出天真的愉快。
    李德荣副班长是个老战士，但年纪也不过二十几岁，他要争取和别班的挑战获得胜利，他亲自教会了新同志的爆炸技术，“上级号召我们打太原要打好、接好、交好，因此，我们不但进行了战斗演习，我们向连长指导员要求登记每个人的私人衣物，保证带多少东西打进太原去，又是带多少东西出城外。
    “为什么这样做？”
    李德荣同志毫不思索的回答我：“因为解放后的太原已经属于人民了。”
    王世春更年轻了，他才二十二岁，家在涿水县，是去年春天被国民党军队抓兵去的，新保安战斗中被我军解放，他说话直率爽快，“到了解放军就是到了家。父母来信对我说，坚决打反动派，革命到底，这次打太原，是我第一次真正打敌人，我计划立一个功，家里正等着报我的功哩。”
    集合号响了，他们习惯的敬礼告别，“太原城里再见”，一转眼，四个健壮的身影，立刻跃进了他们自己的连队。
    人人争先立功，这就是太原前线人民解放军奋勇前进的士气。
