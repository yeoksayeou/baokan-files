　　After Implementing the Contract Responsibility System, Responsibility of Attendants Improved, Saving Much Manpower and Materials at Fengtai Station
　　[This Newspaper News] After implementing the contract responsibility, contract maintenance, and contract inspection system at Fengtai Station, workers' care for machinery and work enthusiasm have been greatly enhanced. The station originally proposed a plan to implement the contract responsibility system a long time ago, but some workers were afraid of trouble and did not understand the idea. In the past, drivers only drove the train and did not care about other things; with the implementation of the contract responsibility system, they would have to take full responsibility for the locomotive. Later, after a period of learning and seeing the benefits of the contract responsibility system on locomotives coming from the Northeast and Tianjin, they began to be willing to implement it; however, they could not find a way to implement it. After the "Mao Zedong" locomotive came to Fengtai in March of this year, the workers obtained specific methods, and their confidence and enthusiasm were greatly improved. The station officially implemented the contract responsibility system on March 17th. Thirty out of forty vehicles were contracted. Three people formed a team, selected each other freely, and combined freely, such as the fireman being selected by the driver, and the locomotive being designated by the factory. That night, many workers were wiping the vehicles overnight and did not sleep until late at night. Some brought wires, rags, and sacks from their homes; others pooled money to buy brooms, water buckets, paint-wrapped wires, and lamp holders. Many attendants automatically returned previous public property, such as locomotive brake handles, signal lights, wrenchs, and iron shovels. The factory also implemented contract parts and contract maintenance. Starting from the 17th, the past set of work that was divided among many people, such as checking fire, watching fire, firing boilers, oiling, igniting, extinguishing fire, and wiping the vehicles, was changed to be done by three people in a team and nine people in three shifts. The remaining people went to the factory or drove the train, which saved a lot in manpower, materials, and financial resources. Now everyone cherishes the train as if it were their own property. The phenomenon of attendants abandoning the train after losing it in the past has disappeared. The workers have used their spare time to rush to repair two locomotives. Recently, in order to commemorate "May Day," the workers are using old locomotives to repair and manufacture the "May 1st" locomotive as a gift to "May Day."

　　丰台站实行包乘制后
  　乘务员责任心提高人力物力节省很多
    【本报讯】丰台车站实行包乘、包修、包检制度，工人对机器的爱护及工作热情皆大大增强。该站本来在很早以前就提出实行包乘制的计划，但有一些工人怕麻烦，思想不通。因为过去开车的光管开车，不管其他；实行包乘制，就要负全部机车的责任。以后经过一段学习，又从东北、天津开来的机车上看到了包乘制的好处，开始愿意实行包乘制了；可是又找不出实行的办法。今年三月“毛泽东号”机车来丰台后，工人们得到了具体办法，信心和热情都提高了。该站即于三月十七日正式实行包乘制，四十台车包了三十台，按三人一班互相挑选，自由结合，如烧火的由司机挑，车头由厂方指定。当天晚上即有许多工人连夜擦车，直到夜深还不睡觉。有的从自己家里拿出电线、破衣服、麻袋；有的自己集股购买条帚、水筒、油漆包线、灯头。很多乘务员自动交还以前的公物：如机车制动把手、信号灯，螺丝把，铁铣等。工厂里也实行了包件包修。十七号开始，就将过去查火、看火、烧罐、浇油、点火、落火、擦车等由许多人分作的一套工作，改成以三个人一班、九个人分三班的轮流干。剩下的人有的上工厂、有的跑车，这样在人力物力财力上都有很大的节省。现在大家都把车当成自己的财产一样的爱护。过去乘务员一丢车就撒手的现象消灭了，工人们已利用业余时间突击修理出了两台机车。最近为了纪念“五一”，工人们正在利用过去的破机车，要修制成“五一号”，作为对“五一”的献礼。
