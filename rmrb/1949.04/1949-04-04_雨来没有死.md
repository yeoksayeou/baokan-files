　　Yu Lai Did Not Die

  　(1)
    In the northern part of Ji Chahar and Jin, there is a Huanxiang River, and many reeds grow in the river. Behind it is a small village. When the reed catkins bloom, from a distance, the lush green reeds look like they are covered with a layer of thick white snow. When the wind blows, the downy reed catkins flutter and fly, covering these dozens of small houses in soft reed flowers. Therefore, this village is called Reed Flower Village. Yu Lai, a twelve-year-old child, is from this village.
    Yu Lai loved this Huanxiang River, which was close to the village. Every summer, Yu Lai, Tie Tou, San Zuan'er, and many other naked children were like a school of fish, diving and resurfacing in the river, playing hide-and-seek, doing the dog paddle, standing float, and floating on their backs. Yu Lai was the best at floating on his back. He could lie face up in the water without sinking, and even expose his little belly on the surface of the water.
    Mother didn't want Yu Lai to play in the water. Mother said that people had drowned in the river, and she was afraid that Yu Lai would be dragged down to be a substitute ghost.
    One day, Mother saw Yu Lai come in from outside. He was not wearing a single piece of clothing, and his body was covered in water stains, tanned black and shiny by the sun. Mother knew he had gone to play in the water again. She frowned and called him "Come here!" She turned around and grabbed a broom from the bed. When Yu Lai saw that he was about to be beaten, he took off running.
    Mother followed closely, chasing after him. Yu Lai ran and looked back. Oh no! She was about to catch up. Where should he run? Tie Tou was driving the cow back from the riverbank and shouted to Yu Lai from afar, "Run to the riverbank! Run to the riverbank!" Yu Lai understood that there was a hidden meaning in Tie Tou's words, so he turned around and ran towards the riverbank. Mother was still chasing after him desperately. Finally, she caught up. She reached out to grab him, but Yu Lai was as slippery as a little mud loach, and she didn't catch him. Plop! He plunged into the river and disappeared. The river water stirred up many circles; gradually expanding. Mother stood on the riverbank, staring blankly at the water circles.
    Suddenly, from a distance, a small head appeared on the surface of the water. He shook the water off his head like a little duck. He wiped his eyes and nose with his hand, blew air out of his mouth, and smiled at Mother.

    Autumn.
    Father came back from selling reed mats at the market and discussed with Mother, "I saw a comrade from the district. He said that it's not good for children not to go to school and study; they should at least go to night school. Let Yu Lai go to night school! Otherwise, he'll be an illiterate in the future."
    The night school was in San Zuan'er's tofu shop. The house was very dilapidated. The night school teacher was a female teacher from the Dongzhuang School: she wore a blue cloth jacket and pants, was plump, and had short hair. When she walked to the blackboard, the buzzing sound of talking immediately quieted down. Everyone flipped through their textbooks, making rustling noises. Yu Lai took out his textbook from his pocket. It was printed on cardboard paper, soft and wrinkled. Yu Lai was afraid of crumpling it, so he asked Mother for a piece of red cloth and wrapped a cover around it. He wrote Yu Lai's name on it in crooked pencil. Yu Lai put the book on his lap, stuck out his tongue to lick his finger, and opened the book. He saw the female teacher standing to the side, leaning over, pointing at the white characters on the blackboard, and reading:
    "We are Chinese.
    We love our motherland." Everyone followed the female teacher's finger and read softly in one voice.
    "We—are—Chinese.
    We—love—our—mother—land."
    (3)
    One day, Yu Lai returned home from night school, lay on the bed, and recited the book he had learned tonight. However, he fell asleep before he could recite half of it.
    He didn't know when, but the door creaked open. Yu Lai opened his eyes and saw a black shadow flash in. Mother struck a match and lit the lamp. Looking closely, it turned out that Father had returned from selling mats, but why was he suddenly dressed like this? He had a bullet bag slung over his shoulder, a hand grenade stuck in his waist, and a long rifle on his back. He said to Mother, "The Japanese devils are sweeping through again. The militiamen are all gathering in the district. It will be a month or two before I can come back." Yu Lai asked Father, "Father, is it far?" Father put his hand under the covers, touching Yu Lai's smooth back, and said, "There's no telling. It could be far, it could be near." Father turned to Mother and said, "Tomorrow, go to his maternal grandmother's house in Dongzhuang. Tell his uncle, just say that the district said to quickly bring the village militia to the district to assemble." Mother asked, "Where is the district?" Father loaded a bag of tobacco and puffed on it. He said, "Tell them to inquire in the villages around Hebei within three days!"
    Yu Lai wanted to say something, but the door "clanged" and Yu Lai heard Father's footsteps thumping away. After a while, he couldn't hear anything anymore. Dog barks came from the street, one or two at a time.
    One day, after eating breakfast, Mother went to Dongzhuang; before leaving, she said she wouldn't be back until evening. It was past noon. Yu Lai ate some leftovers; because he was watching the house, he couldn't go outside, so he had to climb onto the bed and read his literacy textbook wrapped in red cloth.
    Suddenly, he heard people running down the street with a thud, shaking the house as if it were about to fall apart. The window paper rattled.
    Yu Lai jumped off the bed and hid the book in his arms and ran outside. As soon as he stepped over the threshold, someone came in. Yu Lai bumped right into the person's arms. He looked up and saw that it was Uncle Li. Uncle Li was a transport worker from the district and often stayed at Yu Lai's house.
    Then, he heard the Japanese devils yelling "Uliwala." The transport worker, Old Li, hurriedly moved away the jar in the corner that was half-filled with chaff. Yu Lai's eyes widened: "Ah! When was this hole dug?" The transport worker jumped into the hole and said, "Move the jar back to its original place, and quickly go to another courtyard. Don't tell anyone."
    Twelve-year-old Yu Lai used all his strength to move the jar back to its original place.
    Yu Lai had just reached the main room when he saw a dozen shiny bayonets coming in from the front door. He took off running towards the back. Behind him, there was a "crack" of a gun bolt, and someone shouted loudly, "Stop!" But Yu Lai ignored him. He ran towards the backyard as if he had wind under his feet. Then, bullets flew over his head with a "whoosh." But there was no door in the backyard. Yu Lai broke out in a cold sweat. There was a peach tree against the wall, and Yu Lai hugged the tree and climbed up. The Japanese devils had already chased him to the foot of the tree. They reached out and grabbed Yu Lai's foot, pulling him down, and Yu Lai fell to the ground. They twisted his arms behind his back, tied him up, and pushed him back into the house.
    (4)
    The Japanese devils had searched all over the front and back yards.
    The house had also been ransacked: even the pillows had been ripped open with bayonets.
    The Japanese officer sitting on the edge of the bed, his eyes red, was like a wild dog that had just eaten a dead person. He asked Yu Lai in Chinese, "Boy, I'm asking you, you're not allowed to lie!" Suddenly, he looked at Yu Lai's chest, his mouth open, his eyes wide. Yu Lai looked down: it turned out that in the struggle just now, the literacy textbook had been exposed from his arms. The Japanese devil grabbed it, flipped through it, and asked him, "Who gave you this?" Yu Lai said, "I found it!"
    The Japanese devil piled up the horizontal muscles on his face. He showed a mouthful of gold teeth. He made a face and said to Yu Lai gently, "Don't be afraid! The imperial army greatly loves children!? As he spoke, he called someone in Japanese to untie him.
    Yu Lai put his hands down and felt his arms become more numb and painful. The flat-nosed officer touched Yu Lai's head and said, "It doesn't matter who gave you this book, I won't ask. But you must tell me everything else! Just now, someone ran in, did you see him?"
    Yu Lai wiped his nose with the back of his hand and mumbled, "I was in the house, I didn't see anything!" The flat-nosed officer reached into his leather bag. Yu Lai thought, "What is he taking out? A knife? The Japanese devils get angry and gouge out children's eyes." But what he took out was a handful of snow-white Japanese candy. He stuffed it into Yu Lai's hand and said, "This is very good! You eat it, you tell: where is he? I have a lot of gold tickets." He held out the finger with the gold ring and said, "This, gold, all give to you!"
    Yu Lai didn't take his candy, and he didn't answer him.
    A Japanese devil next to him pulled out his knife with a "whoosh," glared at Yu Lai, and was about to slash at his head. The flat-nosed officer shook his round head. The two of them chattered in Japanese for a while. That person glared at Yu Lai, rolled his eyes, and forcefully put the knife back in its sheath.
    The flat-nosed officer suppressed the anger in his belly and gently patted Yu Lai's shoulder, saying, "Dead or alive, I won't kill, I greatly like children, did you see him? Speak!"
    Yu Lai shook his head and said, "I was in the house, I didn't see anything!"
    The flat-nosed officer's eyes immediately became fierce and terrible. He bent forward and suddenly stretched out his hands. Ah! These hands were like eagle claws! He twisted Yu Lai's ears, pulling them to both sides. Yu Lai cried out in pain. Then, the Japanese devil drew out a hand and slapped Yu Lai's face left and right, "Slap! Slap!" He slapped him twice, then pinched a piece of flesh on Yu Lai's face and twisted it with gritted teeth. Yu Lai's face immediately turned white, then green, then purple. He punched him in the chest. Yu Lai couldn't stand still and staggered back a few steps. The back of his head hit the cabinet. His body swayed and was about to fall, but he was immediately grabbed again, and his stomach hit the edge of the bed. It took Yu Lai a long time to catch his breath. His head felt like a beehive, buzzing, his eyes were flashing gold, and blood was flowing from his nose. The blood droplets fell and splashed on the lines of words in his textbook:
    "We are Chinese.
    We love our motherland."
    The Japanese devil was tired of beating him, but Yu Lai still gritted his teeth and said, "Didn't see!"
    The flat-nosed officer was furious and jumped up, roaring, "Shoot him! Shoot him! Drag him out! Dead! Dead!"
    (5)
    The sun had already set. In the blue sky, patches of floating clouds looked like red silk, shining on the Huanxiang River, and the river water looked like it was filled with large patches of cockscomb flowers. The reed catkins in the reed pond were blown up by the wind and floated and flew above.
    The people of Reed Flower Village heard several gunshots on the riverbank. The old people said with tears in their eyes:
    "Yu Lai is a good child! It's a pity he died!"
    "Great ambitions are not limited by age."
    The children of Reed Flower Village, Yu Lai's friends Tie Tou and Xiao Hei, and several others, cried when they heard the gunshots.
    (6)
    The transport worker Uncle Li didn't see Yu Lai moving the jar in the tunnel. Fortunately, there was another exit in the yard. Uncle Li tentatively pushed open the stone slab over the tunnel entrance, pushed aside the reeds, and the yard was empty, without a single person in sight. He didn't see any movement around him. Suddenly, he heard someone yelling on the street: "Tofu!" Uncle Li knew that this was the code of Reed Flower Village, and he understood that the enemy had gone far away.
    But why was Yu Lai still not to be seen? He searched all over the house and yard, but there was no trace of Yu Lai. He ran to the street to ask and learned, "Yu Lai was beaten to death by the Japanese devils on the riverbank!"
    When Uncle Li heard this, his head buzzed, his ears rang, and tears flowed down his face. He followed the people to the riverbank with all his might.
    When he arrived at the riverbank, he didn't see a corpse, not even a drop of blood.
    Everyone stood blankly on the riverbank. The Huanxiang River was quiet, the river water swirled and flowed downwards. Insects chirped in the grass. Someone said, "Maybe the Japanese devils threw Yu Lai into the river and he was washed away!" Everyone searched downstream along the riverbank. Suddenly, Tie Tou shouted, "Ah! Yu Lai! Yu Lai!"
    In the reeds, a small head emerged from the water, still like a little duck, shaking the water off his head, wiping his eyes and nose with his hand. He blew air out of his mouth and asked the people on the shore, holding onto the reeds with one hand, "Have the Japanese devils left?" Ah! Everyone shouted with joy, "Yu Lai didn't die! Yu Lai didn't die!"
    It turned out that before the gun was fired, Yu Lai took advantage of the Japanese devils' carelessness and suddenly plunged into the river. The Japanese devils hurriedly shot into the water, but our little hero Yu Lai had already swam far away from underwater.

　　雨来没有死
    管桦
  　（一）
    在冀察晋的北部，有一道还乡河，河里长着很多的芦苇。背后有一个小村庄。芦花开的时候，远远望去，碧绿的芦苇上，象盖了一层白白的厚雪。风一吹，鹅毛般的苇絮，就飘飘悠悠地飞起来，把这几十家小房屋，都罩在柔软的芦花里。因此，这村就叫做芦花村。十二岁的儿童——雨来就是这村里的。
    雨来最喜欢这道紧靠着村边的还乡河。每到夏天，雨来和铁头、三钻儿，还有很多很多光屁股的小朋友，好象一群鱼，在河里钻上钻下，藏猫猫、狗刨、立浮、仰浮。雨来仰浮的本领最高。能够脸朝天在水里躺着，不但不沉底，还要把小肚皮露在水面上。
    妈妈不叫雨来耍水。妈妈说河里有淹死的人，怕把雨来拉去当替死鬼。
    有一天，妈妈见雨来从外面进来。身上连一丝布条也不挂，混身的水锈，被太阳晒得油黑发亮。妈妈知道他又去耍水，把脸一沉，叫他“过来！”扭身就到炕上抓条帚，雨来一看要挨打啦，撒腿就往外跑。
    妈妈紧跟着追出来。雨来一边跑着，一边回头。糟了！眼看要追上了。往哪儿跑呢？铁头正赶着牛从河沿回来，远远向雨来喊：“往河沿跑！往河沿跑！”雨来听出铁头话里面有道眼，就折转身，朝着河沿跑。妈妈还是死命追着不放。到底追上了。伸手一抓，可是雨来混身光溜溜象个小泥鳅，一下没抓住，卜通，扎在河里不见了。河水卷起很多圆圈；渐渐扩大。妈妈立在河岸上，眼望着水圈发怔。
    忽然，从老远地方，水面上露出个小脑袋来。象个小鸭子一样抖着头上的水。一边用手抹了一下眼睛和鼻子，嘴里吹着气，望着妈妈笑。
    （二）
    秋天。
    爸爸从集上卖苇子席回来，同妈妈商量说：“看见区上工作同志，说是孩子们不上学念书不行，起码要上夜校。叫雨来上夜校吧！要不，将来闹个睁眼瞎。”
    夜校就在三钻儿家的豆腐房里。房子很破，教夜课的，是东庄学堂里的女老师：穿着青布裤褂，胖胖的，剪着短发，走到黑板前面，于是，嗡嗡嗡嗡说话的声音就立时安静了。听大家翻课本，哗啦哗啦掀纸的声音。雨来从口袋里掏出课本来。这是用加板纸油印的，软古囊囊，雨来怕揉搓坏了，向妈妈要了一块红布，包了个书皮。上面用铅笔歪歪斜斜写着雨来的名字。雨来把书放腿上，伸出舌头舐舐指头，掀开书。见女老师闪在一边，斜着身子，用手指着黑板上的白字，念着：
    “我们是中国人
    我们爱自己的祖国”大家就随着女老师的手指，用一个声音，轻轻地念起来。
    “我—们—是—中—国—人
    我们—爱—自—己—的—祖—国”
    （三）
    有一天，雨来从夜校回到家，躺在炕上，背诵今天晚上学会的书。可是，背不到一半就睡着了。
    不知什么时候，门吱扭响了一声。雨来睁开眼，见闪进一个黑影。妈妈划了根火柴，点着灯。一看，原来是爸爸出外卖席回来了，可是，怎么忽然这样打扮起来了呢？肩上披着子弹袋，腰里插着手榴弹，背着一颗长长的步枪，向妈妈说：
    “鬼子又扫荡了，民兵都到区上集合。一两个月才能回来”。雨来问爸爸说：“爸爸，远不远？”爸爸把手伸进被里，摸着雨来光滑滑的脊背，说：“这哪有准儿呢？说远就远，说近就近。”爸爸又转过脸对妈妈说：“明天你到东庄他姥姥家去一趟。告诉他舅舅，就说区上说的，叫他把村里民兵快带到区上去集合”。妈妈问：“区上在哪儿？”爸爸装了一袋烟，巴达巴达轴着。说：“三天里头，叫他们在河北一带村里打听！”
    雨来还想说什么，可是门“况浪”响了一下，雨来就听着爸爸扑咚扑咚走出去的脚步声。不大一会，就什么也听不见了。从街上传来一声两声的狗吠声。
    一天，吃过早饭，妈妈就到东庄去；临走说：晚上才能回来。晌午歪了。雨来吃了点剩饭；因为看家，就不能到外面去，只得爬在炕上念他那红布皮包着的识字课本。
    忽然，听街上咕咚咕咚有人跑，把这房子震的好象要摇幌起来。窗户纸哗啦哗啦响。
    雨来一骨碌下了炕，把书藏在怀里就向外跑，刚一迈门坎；进来一个人。雨来正撞在这个人的怀里。抬头一看，见是李大叔。李大叔是区上的交通员，常在雨来家落脚。
    随后，又听日本鬼子唔哩哇啦的叫。交通员老李，忙把墙角那盛着一半糠皮子的缸搬开。雨来两眼楞住了：“唉！这是什么时候挖的洞呢”？交通员跳进洞里说：“把缸搬回原来地方，你就快到别的院里去，对谁也不许说”。
    十二岁的雨来拿出吃奶的力气，才把缸搬回原来的地方。
    雨来刚到堂屋，见十几把雪亮的刺刀从前门进来。他撒腿就向后跑。背后“卡拉”一声枪拴响，大声叫着：“站住！”可是雨来没理他。脚下象踩着风，一直朝后院跑。随着，子弹向他头顶上嗦嗦地飞来。可是后院没有门。雨来急出一身冷汗。靠墙有一棵桃树，雨来抱着树就向上爬。鬼子已经追到树底下。伸手抓住雨来的脚，往下一拉，雨来就掉在地下。把他两只胳臂向背后一拧，捆绑起来，推推搡搡回到屋里。
    （四）
    前后院鬼子都翻遍了。
    屋子里也遭了劫难：连枕头都用刺刀挑破了。
    炕沿上坐着的那个鬼子军官，两眼红红的，象刚吃过死人的野狗。用中国话问雨来说：“小孩，问你话，撒谎的不许！”突然，他望着雨来的胸脯，张着嘴巴，眼睛睁得圆圆的。雨来低头一看：原来刚才一阵子挣扎，识字课本从怀里露出来。鬼子一把抓在手里，翻着看了看，问他：“谁给你的？”雨来说：“捡来的！”
    鬼子把脸上的横丝肉堆起来。露出满口金牙。做个鬼脸，温和的向雨来说：“害怕的不要！小孩皇军大大的爱护！？说着就用鬼子话叫人替他松绑。
    雨来把手放下来，觉着胳臂更加发麻发痛。扁鼻子军官用手摸着雨来的脑袋说：“这书谁给你的，关系的没有，我的不问了。别的话要通通告诉我！刚才有个人跑进来，看见没有？”
    雨来用手背抹了一下鼻子，嘟嘟哝哝的说：“我在屋里，什么也没看见！”扁鼻子军官伸手在皮包里掏。雨来心里想：“掏什么呢？找刀子？鬼子生了气要挖小孩眼睛的。”可是掏出来的却是一把雪白的日本糖块。往雨来手里一塞，说：“这个大大的好！你的吃吃，你的告诉：他的什么地方？金票大大的有。”他又伸出那个带金戒指的手指说：“这个，金的，统统的给你！”
    雨来没有接他的糖，也没有回答他。
    旁边一个鬼子飕的抽出刀来，瞪着眼睛要向雨来头上劈。扁鼻子军官摇摇他的圆脑袋。两个人唧唧咕咕说了一阵日本话。那人向雨来横着脖子翻白眼，使劲把刀放回鞘里。
    扁鼻子军官压着肚子里的火气，用手轻轻拍着雨来的肩膀说：“死了死了的没有，我的不叫，我大大的喜欢小孩，你看见的没有？说呀！”
    雨来摇摇头，说：“我在屋里，什么也没看见！”
    扁鼻子军官的眼光，立时变得凶恶可怕，向前弯着身子，突然伸出两手。呵！这手就象鹰的爪子！扭着雨来的两个耳朵，向两边拉。雨来疼的裂着嘴叫。随后，这鬼子又抽出一只手来，在雨来脸上左右开弓，拍！拍！打了两巴掌，又用手把他脸上的肉纠起一块，咬着牙拧，雨来脸立时变成白一块、青一块、紫一块。又向他胸脯打了一拳。雨来脚立不稳，打个趔趄，后退几步，后脑勺正碰在柜板上。身子一歪要倒下去，但立刻又被抓过来，肚子撞在炕沿上。雨来半天才喘过这口气。脑袋里象有一窠蜂，嗡嗡地叫，两眼直冒金花，鼻子里流着血，血珠掉下来，溅在课本那几行字上：
    “我们是中国人
    我们爱自己的祖国”
    鬼子打得累了，雨来仍是咬着牙说：“没看见！”
    扁鼻子军官气得暴跳起来，嗷嗷吼叫：“枪毙的有！枪毙的有！拉出去！死了死了的！”
    （五）
    太阳已经落下去。蓝色的天上，飘着一块一块的浮云象红绸子，照在还乡河上，河水里象开了一大杂一大杂的鸡冠花。苇塘的芦花，被风吹起来，在上面飘飘悠悠地飞着。
    芦花村里的人听河沿上响了几枪。老人们都含着泪说：
    “雨来是个好孩子！死的可惜！”
    “有志不在年高”。
    芦花村的孩子们，雨来的小朋友铁头和小黑几个人，听到枪声，都呜呜的哭了。
    （六）
    交通员李大叔在地洞里不见雨来搬缸，幸好院里还有一个出口。李大叔试探着推开洞口上的石板，扒开苇叶，院子里空空的，一个人影也没有，四外也不见动静。忽然听街上有人吆唤着：“豆腐啦！”李大叔知道这是芦花村的暗号，明白敌人已经走远了。
    可是雨来怎么还不见呢？屋里屋外都找遍，也没有雨来的踪影。他跑到街上一问，才知道：“雨来叫日本鬼子打死河沿上啦！”
    李大叔听说，脑袋轰的一声，耳朵叫起来，眼泪流下来。便一股劲地跟着人们向河岸跑。
    到了河岸，别说尸首，连一滴血也没有看见。
    大家呆呆的在河岸上立着，还乡河静静的，河水打着旋涡哗哗地向下流。虫子在草颗里叫着，不知谁说：“也许鬼子把雨来扔在河里冲走了！”大家就顺着河岸向下找，突然铁头叫起来：“呵！雨来！雨来！”
    在芦苇里，水面上露出个小脑袋来，还是那么象个小鸭子一样，抖着头上的水，一边用手抹了一下眼睛和鼻子。嘴里吹着气，一手扒着芦苇，向岸上人问道：“鬼子走了？”呵！大家都欢喜的叫起来：“雨来没有死！雨来没有死！”
    原来，枪没响以前，雨来就趁鬼子不防备，冷不防扎到河里去。鬼子慌忙的向水里打枪，我们的小英雄雨来却已经从水底游到远处去了。
