　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 17th: According to TASS, Greek civil servants decided on the 15th to continue the strike that began on the 6th of this month, because the royalist-fascist government violated the terms of the agreement reached with the striking civil servants on the 14th. The government refused to increase the allowances for April, May, and June by 50 percent each, and decided to postpone the increase until July. The Greek government's breach of promise was decided after consultation with American advisors stationed in Greece. After the decision, they threatened the striking civil servants with dismissal.

　　反对政府破坏协议希公务员继续罢工
    【新华社北平十七日电】据塔斯社讯：希腊公务员于十五日决定继续在本月六日开始的罢工，因为保皇法西斯政府违背了十四日与罢工公务员之间的协议条款，拒绝增加四、五、六三个月的津贴各百分之五十；而决定把增加津贴之事，推延到七月再说。希腊政府违背诺言的行为，是和美国驻希顾问磋商后决定的，决定后又以解职威胁罢工公务员。
