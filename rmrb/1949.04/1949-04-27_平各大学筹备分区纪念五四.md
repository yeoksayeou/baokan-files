　　Universities in Beiping Prepare Zonal Commemorations of May Fourth
    [Our Newspaper] In order to hold decentralized commemorations of the "May Fourth" Movement, the Student Union of this city and various universities yesterday (the 26th) formed five zonal preparatory committees centered around Peking University, Normal University, Fu Jen Catholic University, Art Vocational School, and Tsinghua University: Central, Southwest, Northwest, Southeast, and Suburban. It was also decided that in commemorating "May Day," in addition to major universities and middle schools selecting student representatives to attend the "May Day" Commemoration Representative Assembly, students from various schools should also be called upon to replace workers in their work during the "May Day" worker holiday. For the commemoration of "May Fourth," each zone will hold lectures before "May Fourth," inviting labor heroes and others to give speeches. On the morning of "May Fourth," students from each school will visit the theater and movie screenings hosted by the city's "May Day" "May Fourth" Commemoration Preparatory Committee and send representatives to participate in the "May Fourth" Youth Representative Assembly. In the evening, five zones will hold commemorative evening parties separately.
    [Another Dispatch] The preparatory committee of the Beiping Municipal Primary and Secondary School Teachers' Union, in order to expand the commemoration of "May Day" and "May Fourth" and strengthen the integration of intellectuals with workers and peasants in education, has decided to hold lectures at two locations today and tomorrow, inviting labor heroes and combat models to give speeches. The content of the lectures will be on issues such as "the integration of intellectuals with workers and peasants." (Jin Feng)
