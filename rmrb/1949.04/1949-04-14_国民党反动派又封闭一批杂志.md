　　Kuomintang Reactionaries
  　Close Down Another Batch of Magazines
    [Broadcast by Beiping Xinhua Broadcasting Station] According to a Nanjing dispatch published in the local Xinmin Daily on the 12th, magazines published in Shanghai, including "Outlook," "Revelation," "China Construction Comprehensive Edition," "University Review," and "Modern Women," were ordered to be closed down by Tang Enbo, commander-in-chief of the Kuomintang Garrison Headquarters of Nanjing, Shanghai, and Hangzhou, on February 27th. The editors of "Outlook," "Revelation," and "China Construction" have "disappeared" one after another before and after the publications were shut down. This is yet another heinous measure by the Kuomintang reactionaries to suppress the people's freedom of speech.

　　国民党反动派
  　又封闭一批杂志
    【北平新华广播电台广播】据此间新民报十二日刊载南京消息：在上海出版的“展望”“启示”“中建综合版”“大学评论”“现代妇女”等杂志，已于二月二十七日为国民党京沪杭卫戍总司令汤恩伯下令封闭。“展望”、“启示”和“中建”的编辑在刊物被封前后，纷纷“失踪”。这是国民党反动派摧残人民言论自由的又一次罪恶措施。
