Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 4th: Tokyo dispatch: Over 25,000 workers in Osaka held their second demonstration on the 2nd, once again suffering bloody suppression by the reactionary Yoshida government. More than 20,000 workers in Tokyo held a demonstration on the 3rd in support of the Osaka workers. The Osaka Workers' Association held a demonstration on March 27th against the Yoshida government and against the revision of the Labor Law. This demonstration was met with the frenzied suppression of the Japanese police, resulting in 75 injuries and one arrest. After the incident, the Osaka Police Department issued a statement on the 2nd, announcing the Osaka Police Department's determination to adopt a "big stick policy" to suppress demonstrators, using firearms if necessary. Upon learning of this statement, angry Osaka workers immediately held another demonstration. Under the bloody suppression of the police, according to incomplete statistics, three more workers were seriously injured, some were slightly injured, and eighteen were arrested in this demonstration. After this news reached Tokyo, workers from forty trade unions affiliated with the Japan Federation of Industrial Organizations immediately convened a mass meeting on the 3rd, resolving to protest to the Yoshida government against the barbaric suppression by the Osaka police, and held a protest demonstration on the streets of Tokyo.
