　　How are jobs allocated after graduating from a Workers' School?
Editor:
    I read the article in your newspaper on March 26th regarding the preferential treatment measures for students of the North China People's Government Workers' Cadre School. I would like to know what kind of talents this school cultivates? When does it enroll students? And how are jobs allocated after graduation? I am a worker and eager to have the opportunity to study New Democracy and serve the broad masses of the people. I hope you can enlighten me.
              　　　　　　　　　　　　Third Sewing Department Worker, Pingjin Clothing Factory, Tang Wenxiu
To Comrade Tang Wenxiu:
    Regarding the questions you raised, the answers are as follows:
    1. The purpose of the North China Workers' Cadre School is to: conduct education on the basics of Marxism-Leninism and the theory of the Chinese revolution, improve the political and ideological level of workers, cultivate industrial production and workers' movement cadres, and promote the leading role of the proletariat in China's new construction. Therefore, all employed industrial workers and staff who are willing to serve the construction of New China can apply for the entrance examination.
    2. Currently, the North China Workers' Cadre School headquarters is located at 26 Jiujiang Road, Tianjin. Personnel have been dispatched to Peiping to recruit students and the enrollment brochure will be announced soon and the enrollment examination will begin.
    3. After graduating from the Workers' Cadre School, work will be assigned back to the original factory or enterprise, or introduced to relevant departments, with reference to individual wishes.
