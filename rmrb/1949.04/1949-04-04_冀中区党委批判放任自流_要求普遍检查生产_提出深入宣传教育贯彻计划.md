JiZhong District Party Committee Criticizes Letting Things Drift
　　Demands Universal Production Inspection
    Proposes In-Depth Propaganda Education Implementation Plan
    [JiZhong Electric] The CCP JiZhong District Committee issued instructions on March 26th to continue implementing and completing this year's agricultural production plan. The instructions summarized the achievements of the past month and pointed out: Currently, in many areas, the concrete organization for implementing the production plan is insufficient, leading to the following problems: (1) The implementation of this year's production plan is not deep or universal enough. Some county, district, and village cadres do not pay enough attention to leading production, believing that production will happen even without their leadership. Another portion of village cadres harbor incorrect ideas: they are unwilling to attend meetings in the county; for example, in Jin County, one hundred village branch secretaries did not attend county meetings. Moreover, many villages have not properly integrated production with military service and return to the ranks; some villages have not conveyed the plan to the masses at all, and others have held meetings of the branch, party members, and village cadres, but then do not know how to proceed. This has caused the production movement to drift along on its own. (2) Regarding leadership methods and work style, some village cadres force the masses to fill in numbers for planting cotton and peanuts. This makes the masses feel that production is merely about completing tasks from higher levels, which leads to many concerns. Another portion of village cadres are blindly arrogant and undisciplined, looking down on the new district cadres, neither accepting leadership nor properly grasping the work, which is also a serious problem. (3) Due to insufficient in-depth propaganda and education, and because promoting more grain crops and fewer cash crops has been emphasized for more than a decade, many masses are now concerned about increasing the planting of cotton and peanuts due to the sudden change, mainly fearing the labor involved, the lack of firewood for burning, and the increased burden of taxation. At the same time, there has been little rain this spring, which has increased the difficulty of spring plowing and sowing. Currently, the JiZhong District's work on military service and return to the ranks is nearing completion, and all efforts will be directed towards leading mass production. Based on the aforementioned problems and the current seasonal conditions, the instructions put forward the following points:
    (1) Local committees and county committees can, at a suitable time in the near future, convene short-term cadre meetings to examine the implementation of the production plan, exchange experiences in leading mass production, solve ideological problems among cadres, and re-examine and strictly verify the increased production plan. For those areas that have the conditions to exceed the original plan, the increased production requirements should be appropriately raised; for those that cannot complete the increased production plan, the reasons should be found and solutions studied; and for those that genuinely find it difficult to complete the plan, it should be revised. It is necessary to prevent both subjectivism and blindly accepting excessively high numbers, and to prevent excessive accommodation of the masses' narrow planting habits, emphasizing difficulties and neglecting the initiative of leadership. We must think of more ways based on facts to ensure the completion of the production plan. (2) April and May are the most crucial seasons for agricultural production in the year. Various major autumn crops, such as cotton and peanuts, must be sown during the Qingming, Guyu, Lichun, and Xiaoman solar terms. If the farming season is missed, the plans for increasing grain, cotton, and peanut planting will fail. However, this spring is dry, and we must prepare to implement this year's increased production plan while preventing drought and preparing for famine. We should immediately think of various ways to break the masses' thinking of relying on the heavens for food, mobilize the masses to actively repair old waterwheels and old wells, make new waterwheels and dig new wells and earthen wells. In areas with canals, the construction, management, and use of canals should be strengthened to expand the area of irrigated land. Once the planting season arrives, if it does not rain, we should immediately organize the masses to carry water for spot planting, strictly prevent a wait-and-see attitude, and ensure that we do not miss the farming season. At the same time, our district will mobilize 100,000 civilian workers to repair rivers and control floods after spring sowing and before wheat ripens, which will take about half a month. The along the river, especially the counties should prepare for this huge project. There should be a detailed plan for the management of civilian workers and the organization of labor. Ensure that manpower is not wasted and the farming season is not delayed. (3) To increase the enthusiasm of the masses for production, it is necessary to carry out in-depth and universal propaganda and education work. In response to the various ideological concerns of the masses, we must patiently explain from their own vital interests to dispel their concerns. According to local experience, the first step is to enlighten the thinking of party members and lead the masses with their own actions. Secondly, through experienced and successful old farmers who plant cash crops, we should hold symposiums with old farmers and widely introduce their personal experiences and benefits, using various forms such as people's schools to persuade the masses. Thirdly, we must break through the narrow and conservative thinking of farmers who only grow what they eat, the most important thing is to vigorously promote the spirit of the new agricultural tax regulations, explaining that the agricultural burden will be fixed in the future, and for the same land, if the harvest volume exceeds the corresponding output due to planting cash crops or intensive cultivation, the excess part will not increase the burden much. (4) Strengthen the leadership, education, supervision, and inspection of village cadres, and overcome the state of disorganization and indiscipline and the bad phenomenon of arrogance among village cadres in a planned and step-by-step manner. Those who openly resist leadership, deceive and conceal from superiors, and make serious mistakes repeatedly without correction, should be disciplined; those who privately apportion village funds, conceal and falsely report land acreage, gamble and loiter, and violate government laws should be dealt with according to the law to suppress evil and promote righteousness.

　　冀中区党委批判放任自流
  　要求普遍检查生产
    提出深入宣传教育贯彻计划
    【冀中电】中共冀中区党委于三月二十六日发出继续贯彻与完成今年农业生产计划的指示。指示中总结了一个月来的成绩，并指出：现在有不少地区，具体组织生产计划的实现不够，致发生以下问题：（一）对今年生产计划的贯彻，不够深入与普遍。有些县、区、村干部对领导生产不重视，认为不领导群众也会生产。另一部份村干部，存有错误思想：不愿到县参加开会，如晋县有一百个村的支部书记不到县开会。又因很多村生产与参军归队不能很好结合；有的村根本没有向群众传达，有的村开过支部、党员、村干三个会以后，便不知怎样动手了。致使生产运动形成自流状态。（二）在领导方法与作风上，有的村干部强让群众填写种植棉花、花生的数字。使群众觉得生产只是完成上级任务，因而产生很多顾虑。另有一部份村干部，存在盲目的自高自大和无组织无纪律状态，瞧不起新的区干部，既不接受领导，亦不很好掌握工作，这也是相当严重的问题。（三）由于宣传教育不够深入，十余年来又曾是提倡多种食粮、少种经济作物；现在骤然转变，很多群众对增种棉花、花生存有顾虑，主要的是怕费工，怕没有柴禾烧，怕征收时增加负担。同时今春少雨，增加了春耕播种的困难。目前冀中区参军归队工作行将结束，将全力转向领导群众生产。根据上述发生的问题与当前季节情况，指示提出以下几点：
    （一）各地委、县委，可于最近的适当时间，召开短时期的干部会议，检查生产计划的执行，交流领导群众生产的经验，解决干部思想问题，重新严格审核增产计划。对有条件超过原定计划的还应适当提高增产要求；对不能完成增产计划的，应找出原因，研究解决办法；对实难完成计划的，则应加以修正，既要防止主观主义、盲目地承认过高数字；又须防止过分迁就群众狭隘的种植习惯，强调困难、忽视领导的能动性，必须有根据的多想办法，保证生产计划的完成。（二）四、五月份是一年农业生产最关重要的季节，各种大秋作物棉花、花生等，皆须于清明、谷雨、立夏、小满四个节令中播种，如农时错过，则增粮、增种棉花、花生等计划，皆将落空。但今春天旱，必须准备在防旱备荒中贯彻今年增产计划。应立即想各种办法，打破群众靠天吃饭的思想，发动群众积极修理旧水车旧井，添制新水车凿新井、土井，有渠道的地区，要加强渠道的修筑管理使用，扩大浇地面积。一到种植节令，如天不下雨，即应全力组织群众挑水点种，严防等待心理，保证不误农时。同时我区将于春播后麦熟前动员十万民工修河治水，约需半月时间。对这一巨大工程，特别是沿河各县，应预作准备。对于民工的管理，劳动力的组织，应有周密计划。做到不浪费民力，不耽误农时。（三）为提高群众生产的积极性，必须深入普遍地进行宣传教育工作。针对群众各种思想顾虑，从其切身利益出发，耐心解释，予以打破。根据各地经验，首先是打通党员的思想，以自己的行动带动群众。其次是通过种植经济作物有经验有成绩的老农，以其身历的事实和好处，召开老农座谈会，利用民校等各种形式广泛介绍，说服群众。第三、必须突破农民自给自足种什么吃什么的狭隘保守思想，最主要的是大力宣传新农业税则的精神，说明今后农业负担固定，相同之土地因种植经济作物或精耕细作，其收获量超过相同土地之应产量者，其超过部份，亦不多增负担。（四）加强对村干部的领导教育、督促与检查，有计划有步骤地克服村干部中无组织无纪律状态和恶劣的自高自大现象。对于公然对抗领导，欺骗隐瞒上级，错误严重屡教不改的，要予以纪律制裁；对于私自摊派村款隐瞒假报土地亩数，聚赌游荡，违犯政府法令者，要依法处理。以压邪气而扶正气。
