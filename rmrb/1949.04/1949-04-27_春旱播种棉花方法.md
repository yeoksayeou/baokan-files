Spring Drought Cotton Planting Methods

　　(1) Germination and Slowing Germination

    I. Germination: In North China, spring is generally dry, and the soil moisture is insufficient, making it difficult for seeds to germinate and break through the soil. Therefore, before sowing, it is necessary to stimulate their vitality and initiate it first by soaking the seeds to increase their moisture. Around Grain Rain (a solar term, around April 20th), after the cotton fields are prepared, and the sowing date is determined, if cold water soaking is used, it can be done three days before sowing; if warm water soaking is used, it can also be done one day before sowing.

    Cold water soaking method involves soaking the cotton seeds in cold water and stirring the seeds with a wooden stick every few hours. Half a day before sowing, take out the seeds and mix them with mud ash for use.

    The warm water soaking method involves pouring a bucket of water that is close to boiling point and immersing the cotton seeds. Immediately stir quickly with a wooden stick for about three minutes, then immediately add twice the amount of cold water. Stir slightly, and take out the cotton seeds the next morning, mixing them with mud ash for use. (The warm soaking time should be well controlled, as too long a time will damage the seeds and make it difficult for them to germinate—Editor's note.)

    All soaked cotton seeds, when taken out and exposed to sunlight for only a few hours, will have slight sprouts emerging. For cotton seeds with exposed sprouts, sowing and covering with soil must be especially careful. Generally, people believe that it is best to sow cotton seeds with exposed sprouts. In fact, as long as the cotton seeds are thoroughly soaked and in contact with moist soil after being sown, they can germinate and emerge from the soil in the same way if the soil covering is done properly. Sowing and covering cotton seeds with exposed sprouts carries the risk of damaging the sprouts, and the longer the sprouts, the greater the risk.

    II. Slowing Germination: Soaked cotton seeds sprout very quickly. In sunlight, they can grow to two or three fen (a unit of length, approximately 0.2-0.3 cm) from morning to afternoon. If they cannot be sown on the same day, or if it suddenly rains and sowing cannot continue, the only way to remedy this situation is to use the "slowing germination" method. This involves re-soaking the cotton seeds in cold water, preferably in a shady place, and changing the water every five or six hours. This can be somewhat effective. How long seeds can withstand being soaked also depends on the variety of cotton. Generally, soaking in cold water for a week is not a problem; after a week, there is a risk.

    (2) Watering and Spot Sowing Method in Severe Drought

    In many places in North China, cotton is sown in the same way as wheat and millet, using a drill or a harrow to open furrows for sowing. This method is more suitable for use in spring when there is rain or in irrigated land. If it is used in dry land and encounters a severe drought in cotton-growing areas, seedlings will not emerge. This requires digging holes for spot sowing, carrying water to irrigate the holes, then sowing the seeds and covering them with soil. This sowing method ensures stable seedling emergence.

    Digging holes for spot sowing is too labor-intensive, so special attention must be paid to planting distance. Generally, people are reluctant to widen the row and plant spacing, so increasing the number of holes per mu (a unit of area, approximately 0.16 acres) requires much more time. Generally, the row spacing should be two chi five cun (a unit of length, approximately 83 cm), and the plant spacing should be two chi (approximately 67 cm), with approximately 1,200 holes per mu, which is about the same labor as using a harrow to open furrows and irrigate. If it is considered too sparse, the method of leaving one plant or two plants per hole during thinning can be used, leaving 1,500 to 2,000 plants per mu. Hole sowing is not only more reliable for seedling emergence, but also saves more than half the seeds compared to using a harrow to open furrows for sowing, and also saves a considerable amount of water.

    When digging holes for spot sowing, the rows should be arranged neatly. First, use a harrow to open the furrows, then dig holes along the furrows. The holes should be about three cun (approximately 10 cm) deep. Irrigate the holes accordingly, with each kerosene bucket of water irrigating about eight holes. After irrigation, do not sow immediately; wait until the soil is moist to a suitable degree. The soil particles can be tested with two fingers; it is best to sow when the soil particles can be crushed and are not sticky. Generally, sowing can be done about three or four hours after irrigation. When sowing, use a shovel to loosen the soil, then sow the seeds, about ten healthy seeds per hole, which is enough to break through the soil. Cover the seeds with about one cun (approximately 3 cm) of moist soil to a suitable degree, then gently pat it a few times with a small shovel, and then cover it with a two-fen (approximately 0.6 cm) thick layer of dry, loose soil, which is sufficient.

    If the weather is severely dry and sowing cannot be done, the only way to remedy this is to dig soil wells on the spot to obtain water. In many places in North China, such as southeast of Nanyuan, south of Langfang, and the plains of central and southern Hebei, where the water source is not deep, the "digging soil wells" method is often used. Each soil well takes about three workdays to dig, and the water from each soil well is enough to plant five to ten mu of cotton.

　　春旱播种棉花方法
  　（一）催芽与缓芽
    一　催芽：华北一般春季干旱，土中水分不足，种子不易发芽破土，故在下种之前，须催其生机先行发动，实行浸种，增加种籽水分。谷雨前后棉田整理就绪，决定了下种的日期后，如用冷水浸，在下种前三天就可举行；倘采温水浸法，在播种前一天也可。
    冷水浸法即将棉籽浸在冷水里，每隔数小时用木棒将种子搅拌数下，至下种前半天将种子取出，拌以泥灰即可应用。
    温水浸法是用将达沸点的水一桶，将棉子浸入，随即用木棒赶快搅动，约三分钟，即刻再加入冷水两倍，稍事搅和，至第二天早晨取出棉籽，拌以泥灰即可应用。（温浸时间应很好掌握，时间过长种籽即受损，不易出芽——编者）
    凡浸过的棉籽，取出后晒于阳光下只要数小时，即有芽尖微露。露了芽尖的棉籽，播种覆土须特别小心。一般人认为露了芽尖的棉籽下种最好，其实只要棉籽浸透，下土后接着湿土的话，覆土得法也同样的可以发芽出土。露了芽尖的棉籽，播种覆土时有伤芽的危险，芽尖愈长，危险性愈大。
    二　缓芽：浸过的棉籽，芽尖长得很快，在阳光下，自上午到下午有长至二三分的，倘当天不能播完，或因忽然下了雨不能继续播种，在这种时候，只有用“缓芽”的办法来补救。即将棉子再浸在冷水里，最好放在阴处，每隔五六小时换清水一次，这样多少可收点效。浸种究可耐至多久，也因棉花的品种不同而有差别，普通浸在冷水里一周是无妨碍的，过一星期以后，就有危险了。
    （二）苦旱时的浇水点播法
    华北许多地方，种棉花也同种麦子谷子一样地用耧或用耠子开沟播种。此种法在春季落雨或水地采用较为适宜，如在旱地又遇苦旱的棉区，这样种下出不了苗，这就需要挖穴点播，挑水灌在穴里，然后下种覆土，这个种法出苗来得稳。
    挖穴点播太费工，因之对种植距离就需特别讲究。一般人都舍不得将行株间距离放宽，所以每亩穴数加多起来，就要多费许多时间。一般行间应距离二尺五寸，株间应距离二尺，每亩计一千二百穴，比用耠子开沟灌水种法费工差不多。如嫌太稀，定苗时每穴以一株与二株相间的留法，每亩留一千五百株到二千株。穴播不仅出苗较有把握，且比用耠子开沟播种省种子一倍以上，省水亦不在少。
    挖穴点种，宜将行间排列整齐，先用耠子开好沟，依沟挖穴，穴深约三寸，依穴灌水，每煤油桶的水量约灌八穴。灌水之后，不能立刻下种，须待土壤湿润适度，可用两手指试探，至土粒可粉碎而无粘性时下种最好。大概在灌水三四个钟头后，便可下种，下种时用锨将土挖松，然后下籽，每穴下十粒上下的健全种籽，足够破土的力量。子上覆以湿润适度的土约一寸，随即用小锨稍拍几下，然后再覆干碎土一层二分厚就够。
    如天气苦旱不能播种，只有就地挖土井取水来补救。华北许多地方如南苑东南、廊坊以南以及冀中、冀南平原地带，水源不深的地方，多用“掘土井”办法，每口土井约费三工，每口土井的水可够种五亩到十亩棉花。
