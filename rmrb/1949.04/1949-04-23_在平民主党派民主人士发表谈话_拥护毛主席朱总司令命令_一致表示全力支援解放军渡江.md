Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, April 22nd: Following Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu’s order to the People's Liberation Army on April 21st, democratic parties, people's organizations, and democratic personages in Beiping have issued statements expressing their support for the order. They also strongly condemned the Kuomintang reactionary government's rejection of the domestic peace agreement, viewing it as a manifestation of the Kuomintang reactionary clique's determination to carry out the counter-revolutionary civil war they initiated to the very end, and to be stubbornly hostile to the people.

Li Jishen: Li Jishen, Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, said: "I am very indignant upon hearing the news that the Nanjing Kuomintang reactionary government rejected the domestic peace agreement drafted by its delegation after lengthy negotiations with the Chinese Communist Party delegation. At the same time, I deeply regret the lack of courage of the 'moving toward the light' faction within the Nanjing government. The 24 concrete measures for achieving domestic peace proposed by the CCP delegation under Chairman Mao Zedong's eight conditions reflect the public will of the entire nation and are both fair and generous. Because two years and nine and a half months ago, the Nanjing reactionary government, headed by Chiang Kai-shek, under the direction of American imperialism, violated the armistice agreement, tore up the Political Consultative Conference agreement, and launched a frantic civil war to slaughter the Chinese people. On the front lines, they committed rape, looting, arson, and murder, stopping at nothing; wherever their troops went, homes were reduced to ruins. In the rear, they forcibly conscripted soldiers, requisitioned supplies, sold out national sovereignty, and brutally murdered patriotic elements. Their crimes were heinous, betraying both Dr. Sun Yat-sen's revolutionary Three Principles of the People and incurring the wrath of all of China's 470 million people. Now, having been defeated in the civil war they initiated against the people by the people's armed resistance, they should receive the punishment they deserve. However, the Chinese Communist Party, 'embracing the principle of treating people with kindness,' will not hold those who have served as tools of the Americans and Chiang Kai-shek and opposed the people to the very end accountable for their past actions, as long as they can perform meritorious service for the cause of the people's liberation. In the negotiations, they made the greatest concessions on the issue of punishing war criminals, which the Nanjing delegation haggled over. They also dealt with the officers and soldiers of the Nanjing Kuomintang reactionary group army and government staff with great leniency. It can be seen that the Chinese Communist Party, in order to spare the people from further war losses, has shown as much leniency as possible, as long as it does not violate the revolutionary goals of realizing the Three Oppositions (i.e., anti-imperialism, anti-feudalism, and anti-bureaucrat capitalism) and the eight principles for resolving domestic peace. Unexpectedly, the Nanjing authorities, which advocate peace, still lack the determination to sever ties with the Americans and Chiang Kai-shek, and still lack the awareness to face the people's power squarely. If they are willing to be hostile to the people, then under the advance of the People's Liberation Army, the fate of being destroyed together with the American and Chiang Kai-shek reactionary group is inevitable. We support the order issued by Chairman Mao of the Chinese People's Revolutionary Military Commission and Commander-in-Chief Zhu of the Chinese People's Liberation Army on April 21st to the People's Liberation Army to advance bravely, resolutely, thoroughly, cleanly, and completely annihilate the Kuomintang reactionaries throughout China. At the same time, we also hope that those in the Nanjing reactionary government camp who truly have a sincere desire for peace will resolutely break away from the shackles of the Americans and Chiang Kai-shek and stand with us."

He Xiangning: He Xiangning, Honorary Chairman of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, said: "All the people of China and Chairman Mao want peace, but the reactionaries still want to continue their dictatorship. Their behavior will not succeed. We are bound to win. All our people across the country will rise up together to help realize Chairman Mao's order."

Shen Junru: Shen Junru, Standing Committee Member of the China Democratic League, said: "In this peace negotiation, the agreement proposed by the CCP has been revised again and again to accept the opinions of the Nanjing delegation. The deadline for signing the agreement has also been extended again and again. The people's side has been extremely generous to the Nanjing reactionary government. However, the peace agreement was still rejected. Who should be responsible is very clear. Chiang Kai-shek and the Kuomintang's main war faction must bear the greatest responsibility, but the so-called 'peace faction' headed by Li Zongren and He Yingqin not only lacked the sincere intention to accept the people's peace conditions, but also failed to resolutely break off relations with Chiang Kai-shek and American imperialism. Even when Huang Shao＠ brought the final revised version of the peace agreement to Nanjing, he still had Wu Tiecheng send it to Xikou for instructions. Li Zongren and He Yingqin's indecisive attitude of recognizing the thief as their father must also bear a great responsibility.

Although the negotiations with the Nanjing reactionary government have stopped now, peace is not hopeless, and it is hoped that true peace will be realized because of this. Because the purpose of the people's revolutionary war was originally to strive for true and lasting peace. Without the series of victories of the People's Liberation Army in the past three years, this peace talk would not have been possible. Now the People's Liberation Army will cross the river and completely eliminate the enemies of the people, then lasting peace throughout China can be established. Therefore, the order issued by Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu today aims to achieve true peace throughout the country. Chiang Kai-shek and his die-hards have long been at the end of their rope and cannot withstand a single blow from the People's Liberation Army. Therefore, even if there is still war, it will only be a short-term war, and lasting peace can be realized thereafter. This is the first point that the Chinese people should recognize.

Although this negotiation has stopped, the third and fourth items of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu's order still give the Kuomintang a way to reform themselves. Except for Chiang Kai-shek, all Kuomintang local governments and armies can sign local peace agreements at any time and place in accordance with the eight articles and twenty-four clauses. Even for the Nanjing Li Zongren government, the door to peace is still open. It can be seen that the people have done everything humanly possible for the Kuomintang reactionaries. If the reactionaries do not wake up again, they will truly not know where to die. This is the second point that all Chinese people should recognize.

Finally, I hope that every Chinese person should rise up, support this order of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and support the People's Liberation Army, so as to remove all obstacles to peace as soon as possible and lay the foundation for lasting peace throughout the country."

Zhang Bojun: Zhang Bojun, Standing Committee Member of the China Democratic League, said: "The Nanjing reactionary government refused to accept the domestic peace agreement, and the People's Liberation Army had no choice but to take armed action to completely complete the liberation cause. This responsibility should be borne by the Nanjing reactionary government.

The main problem during this peace negotiation was that the Nanjing reactionary government refused to allow the People's Liberation Army to cross the river. In fact, the Nanjing reactionary government attempted to maintain its reactionary regime, continue to sell out the interests of the country and the people, and allow a part of China's territory to continue to remain under American rule. In order to maintain the integrity of the country, we must not give in, we must not recognize the Kuomintang reactionaries' conspiracy to postpone the crossing of the river, so the People's Liberation Army must quickly cross the river and crush the situation of the Southern and Northern Dynasties. I hope that when the People's Liberation Army begins to cross to the south, the people south of the Yangtze River and people from all democratic parties will mobilize to help and support the People's Liberation Army in crossing the river. At the same time, call on the people and all democratic parties to support Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu's emergency mobilization order, strive to realize the four major commands, and complete the mission."

Huang Yanpei: Huang Yanpei, Standing Director of the China National Democratic Construction Association, said: "I hope the People's Liberation Army will cross the river quickly and liberate the old folks in Jiangnan quickly."

Ma Xulun: Ma Xulun, Standing Director of the China Association for Promoting Democracy, said: "I am in complete agreement with this order of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu. The Nanjing reactionaries' conspiracy to use peace talks to buy time to catch their breath was exposed by us long ago. This refusal to sign the peace agreement is their own announcement of their crimes to the world. The Nanjing government sent six representatives and twenty-odd attendants, who negotiated with the CCP delegation for more than ten days. Although they did not overturn the eight conditions proposed by the CCP, which they recognized as the basis for the peace negotiation, they have already received a great degree of concessions. We, the heads of the various democratic parties, can all testify to the details of this process. On the side of the democratic parties, we feel that the concessions were too great, but we deeply understand that the CCP is not a warlike element; they only seek to achieve the goals of the revolution. Whether it be war or peace, they don't care about the means. They can strive to achieve a solution that does not violate the goals of the revolution and is resolved in a peaceful manner. Although the degree of concession is larger, they don't care. Concessions such as the first and eighth articles of this agreement, it can be said that any truly fair-minded people would not criticize them. May I ask, is there any instance of the winning side treating the defeated side with such generous treatment? As for the fourth article, which is the basic spirit of the agreement, may I ask, what are we trying to gain in exchange for the sweat and blood of tens of millions of people? If this article can be conceded, then the agreement is unnecessary. This revolution is a joint action of all revolutionary classes under the leadership of the CCP. It is a revolution of the people, and the People's Liberation Army is the people's armed force. The army of the Kuomintang reactionaries is Chiang Kai-shek's private army used to oppress the people, and it should of course be thoroughly reorganized. The measures stipulated in the various clauses of the fourth article are fair and reasonable. Only the Kuomintang reactionaries, who recognize these armies as their private property, feel that there is a problem. It is also because the Kuomintang reactionaries still want to preserve their remaining forces and stage a comeback that they feel that this measure is hindering their attempt to stage a comeback. These eight articles and twenty-four clauses were negotiated by their delegation for more than ten days, and they were in constant communication with Nanjing by telephone and telegram. Now that they have been rendered as waste paper, it can be proven that the Nanjing reactionary government is completely implementing Chiang Kai-shek's conspiracy and has no sincerity for peace. Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu's order of April 21st is in line with the ardent expectations of the people across the country. I personally believe that we must quickly send a large army to cross the river and extinguish the enemies of the people."

Tan Pingshan: Tan Pingshan, Standing Committee Member of the Chinese Kuomintang Three People's Principles Comrades Association, said: "The Nanjing Kuomintang reactionary government's rejection of the domestic peace agreement proves that the Nanjing Kuomintang reactionary government is still controlled by Chiang Kai-shek, the chief culprit of the war under the leadership of American imperialism. When Li Zongren sought peace with the CCP, he openly admitted that Chairman Mao Zedong's eight conditions of the Chinese Communist Party were the basis for the negotiation. Now it proves that he was all false, all in accordance with the intention of the Americans and Chiang Kai-shek and deliberately used as a delaying tactic. Today, the order issued by Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu not only ordered the People's Liberation Army field army to thoroughly, cleanly, and completely annihilate the enemy, but also solemnly pointed out the reasons why the Nanjing reactionary government rejected the domestic peace agreement. The words are solemn and righteous, exposing the conspiracy of the reactionaries. All stubborn war criminals will be punished by the masses of the people."

Liu Yazi: Liu Yazi, Executive Committee Member of the China Democratic League, said: "Hearing that Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu have ordered the People's Liberation Army to attack immediately makes me very excited! We should immediately divide the million-strong army and cross the Yangtze River to capture Chiang Kai-shek alive in Fenghua Xikou."

Peng Zemin: Peng Zemin, Chairman of the Supervisory Committee of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, said: "The Kuomintang reactionary government's rejection of the domestic peace agreement shows that it is determined to carry out the anti-people war to the end, and shows that the so-called peace of the war criminals is nothing more than fake peace. For the benefit of the country and the nation, for the sake of lasting peace, the Chinese people must unite as one, resolutely, bravely, and thoroughly eliminate the war criminal group, eliminate all reactionary forces, and pave the way for a free, peaceful, and prosperous new China, transforming China ruled by imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucrat capitalism into a people's democratic China. Just as the reactionary French government restricted international peace representatives from entering France, the Kuomintang reactionary group rejected the domestic peace agreement, which shows their flesh-and-blood relationship and shows that they are equally loyal lackeys of American imperialism. But they, along with their masters, are both paper tigers. The unparalleled power of the Chinese people, coupled with the power of world peace and democracy, will surely puncture it."

Li Zhangda: Li Zhangda, Standing Committee Member of the People's Salvation Association, said: "The domestic peace agreement drafted by the Chinese Communist Party delegation and the Nanjing Kuomintang government delegation after negotiations in the twenty days since April 1 has been rejected by the Nanjing Kuomintang government. This agreement is based on the eight conditions proposed by the CCP, which the Nanjing Kuomintang government recognized. And these eight conditions, which serve as the basis for the negotiations, are unanimously approved and supported by the people across the country and various democratic parties. Even the twenty-four clauses drafted today are very generous and conducive to the peaceful resolution of the Chinese problem. Now that it has been rejected by the Nanjing government, it proves that the Nanjing government's so-called recognition of the eight conditions as the basis for peace negotiations is completely false, and there is absolutely no sincerity in resolving domestic problems by peaceful means. I feel that the order issued by Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu on April 21st is in line with the demands of the people. Only by doing so can the liberation of the people across the country be achieved."

Cai Tingkai: Cai Tingkai, Acting Chairman of the Chinese Kuomintang Democracy Promotion Association, said: "Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu's order to advance completely represents the will of the people across the country and answers the people's demands. The people of South China have long been waiting for the People's Liberation Army to cross the Yangtze River, liberate South China, and liberate the people of South China. I, on behalf of the Chinese Kuomintang Democracy Promotion Association, completely agree with this order and will make the greatest efforts to support the realization of this order, so that the People's Liberation Army can quickly cross the river, arrest all incorrigible war criminals, especially capture the demon king Chiang Kai-shek for trial by the people, sweep away all reactionary remnants cleanly, and establish a new CPPCC and establish a truly representative joint government of the people as soon as possible."

Chen Qiyou: Chen Qiyou, Chairman of the Central Committee of the China Zhi Gong Party, believes that: "Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu's order for the People's Liberation Army to cross the river completely conforms to the will of the people across the country, and the people across the country will inevitably unanimously serve as the backing. After the liberation of Nanjing and Shanghai in the short term, we must continue to victoriously advance towards South China. South China is the hometown of our overseas compatriots. Today, the situation of overseas Chinese is so bad that it cannot be worse. The safety of the lives and property of overseas Chinese depends on the comprehensive liberation of China and the establishment of an independent and autonomous foreign policy for the new China. Therefore, I hope that the compatriots in South China, especially my comrades in the Zhi Gong Party, will assist the southward march of the army in all aspects and dedicate our strength to the completion of the New Democratic Revolution."

　　在平民主党派民主人士发表谈话
  　拥护毛主席朱总司令命令
    一致表示全力支援解放军渡江
    【新华社北平二十二日电】毛主席、朱总司令四月二十一日对人民解放军的命令发布后，在平各民主党派、人民团体和民主人士纷纷发表谈话，表示拥护这个命令，并力斥国民党反动政府拒绝国内和平协定，认为这是国民党反动集团决心将他们所发动的反革命内战进行到底，死心塌地与人民为敌的表现。
    李济深：中国国民党革命委员会主席李济深说：“我听到南京国民党反动政府拒绝其所派遣的代表团与中国共产党代表团经过长时间谈判所拟定的国内和平协定的消息，非常愤慨，同时又深深惋惜南京政府内部主和派之缺乏“走向光明”的勇气。中共代表团在毛泽东主席的八项条件之下所提出二十四款实现国内和平的具体办法，是反映全国人民的公意，既公正而又宽大的。因为在两年又九个半月以前，以蒋介石为首的南京反动政府，在美帝国主义指示之下，破坏停战协定，撕毁政治协商会议协议，发动疯狂的屠杀中国人民的内战，在前线则奸掳烧杀、无所不为、兵行所至，庐舍为墟；在后方则士兵拉夫，征购征实，出卖国家主权，残杀爱国分子，罪大恶极，既背叛孙中山先生的革命的三民主义之立场，复为全中国四万万七千余万人民所切齿，现在在进攻人民的内战中遭受人民的武装抵抗而失败，自应受到应得之惩处。然而中国共产党“抱与人为善”之旨，除了甘为美蒋工具，反对人民到底之分子外，只要他们能够为人民解放事业立功，便不究其既往，在谈判中对于南京代表团所斤斤较量的惩办战犯问题，曾作了最大的让步，对于南京国民党反动集团军队官兵及政府工作人员，亦作了十分宽大的处理。可见中国共产党为了免除人民再遭受战争损失，只要不违背实现三反（按即反帝、反封建、反官僚资本）革命目标与八项解决国内和平原则，是尽可能地表示宽大的。不想南京主和当局，仍无与美蒋绝缘之决心，仍无正视人民力量之觉悟，甘与人民为敌，则在人民解放军的进军之下，与美蒋反动集团同遭毁灭之命运，自是必然结果。我们拥护中国人民革命军事委员会毛主席与中国人民解放军朱总司令四月二十一日对人民解放军发布之奋勇前进、坚决、彻底、干净、全部地歼灭全中国境内国民党反动派之指令。同时我们亦希望南京反动政府阵营中真有和平诚意者毅然决然脱离美蒋的羁绊和我们站在一起”。
    何香凝：中华全国民主妇女联合会名誉主席何香凝说：“全中国的人民和毛主席都想和平，反动派还想继续专政，他们这种行为是不会成功的，我们是一定胜利的，我们全国人民都一齐起来，帮助毛主席这个命令的实现。”
    沈钧儒：中国民主同盟常务委员沈钧儒说：“在这次和平谈判中，中共所提出的协定，曾经再次三次接受南京代表团的意见而加以修正。协定签字的期限，也一次再次的延长。人民方面对南京反动政府的宽大为怀，是无以复加了。但是和平协定仍被拒绝，谁应当负责，是十分明白的。以蒋介石为首的国民党主战派固然要负最大的责任，但是以李宗仁、何应钦为首的所谓“主和派”既没有接受人民的和平条件的真心真意，又不能毅然决然和蒋介石及美帝国主义断绝关系，直到黄绍＠把和平协定的最后修正案带到南京去，还要叫吴铁城送到溪口去请示，李宗仁、何应钦这种优柔寡断，认贼作父的态度，也要负很大责任。
    现在和南京反动政府的谈判虽然停止。但和平并未绝望，而且因此反更有实现真和平的希望。因为人民革命战争的目的，本来就是为了争取真正的永久的和平，如果没有过去三年间人民解放军的一连串的胜利。这次和谈是不可能的，现在人民解放军大军就将渡江。彻底消灭了人民的敌人，则全中国的永久的和平，就可以建立。所以毛主席朱总司令今天所发表的命令，目的就是为了达成全国的真和平。蒋介石及其死党早已成强弩之末，不堪人民解放军的一击，因此即使还有战争。只不过是短时期的战争，以后永久的和平便可实现，这是中国人民所应当认清的第一点。
    这次谈判虽然停止，但毛主席朱总司令命令的第三、第四项仍予国民党以自新之路。只除了蒋介石以外，一切国民党地方政府及军队，随时随地可以依照八条二十四款，签订地方性的和平协定。甚至对南京李宗仁政府，和平的门户也还是洞开着。可见人民对国民党反动派已做到仁至义尽。反动派如再不觉悟，真将不知死所了。这是全中国人民所应认清的第二点。
    最后我希望每个中国人都应当奋起，拥护毛主席、朱总司令这一命令，支援人民解放军，以便早日扫除一切和平的障碍，奠定全国的永久的和平。”
    章伯钧：中国民主同盟常务委员章伯钧说：“南京反动政府拒绝接受国内和平协定，人民解放军为彻底完成解放事业，不得已采取武装行动，这个责任应该由南京反动政府负担。
    这次和平谈判中间，主要问题是南京反动政府拒绝人民解放军渡江，实际上是南京反动政府企图保持反动政权，继续出卖国家人民利益，让中国一部分领土继续留在美国统治下。我们为了保持国家的完整，决不能让步，决不能承认国民党反动派缓期渡江的阴谋，因此解放军要迅速渡江，粉碎南北朝的形势。我希望人民解放军开始南渡时，大江以南人民暨各民主党派人士动员起来，帮助支持解放军渡江，同时号召人民及各民主党派拥护毛主席朱总司令的紧急动员令，努力实现四大命令，完成任务。”　
    黄炎培：民主建国会常务理事黄炎培说：“我希望人民解放军快快渡江，快快解放江南老百姓。”
    马叙伦：中国民主促进会常务理事马叙伦说：“我对于毛主席朱总司令这个命令是万分赞同的。南京反动派对于和平谈判是换取喘息时机的阴谋，早经我们揭穿，这次拒绝签字于和平协定，是他们自己向世界宣布他的罪恶。南京政府派了六个代表，二十几个随员，与中共代表团经过十几天协商，虽然没有把他们承认的和平谈判的基础八项条件推翻，但已得到很大尺度的让步，其中经过，我们各民主党派的负责人个个可以作证。在各民主党派方面，正觉让步的太大了，不过深切了解中共并非黩武主义者，只求达到革命的目的，战争的方式，和平的方式，在所不计；可以争取到不违背革命的目的而用和平方式得到解决，虽然让步的尺度大些，亦所不计。此次协定中如第一条及第八条的让步，可说任何真正主持公道的人们，不会有所批评。试问战胜方面对战败方面有这样宽大待遇的没有？至于第四条是协定基本精神所在，试问牺牲上千万人民的汗血而要换取的是什么？这条可以让步，协定就可以不要了。这次革命是中共领导的各革命阶层共同行动，是人民的革命，人民解放军是人民的武力；国民党反动派的军队是蒋介石用来压迫人民的私有军队，当然应该彻底改编。第四条各款各项规定的办法，公平合理，只有国民党反动派承认这些军队是他们的私产，才觉得有问题。也由于国民党反动派还想保留残余势力卷土重来，才觉得这种办法，是妨害了他卷土重来的企图。这八条二十四款，是经他们的代表团十几天和南京电话电报往返商定的，现在竟作废纸，可以证明是南京反动政府完全执行蒋介石的阴谋，毫无和平诚意。毛主席朱总司令四月二十一日的这个命令，合乎全国人民的热烈期望，我个人绝对认为必须大军从速渡江，扑灭人民的敌人。”
    谭平山：中国国民党三民主义同志联合会常务委员谭平山说：“南京国民党反动政府拒绝国内和平协定，证明南京国民党反动政府还是受美帝国主义领导之下的战争首犯蒋介石所控制。李宗仁在向中共求和的时候，公开承认以中国共产党主席毛泽东先生八项条件为谈判的基础，现在证明他都是虚伪的，都是秉承美蒋的意旨而故作缓兵之计的。今日毛泽东主席朱总司令发出的命令，除命令解放军野战军彻底干净全部歼灭敌人外，并严正指出南京反动政府之所以拒绝国内和平协定的理由，词严义正，揭破了反动派阴谋。所有冥顽不灵的战争罪犯，必将受人民大众的惩办。”
    柳亚子：中国民主同盟执行委员柳亚子说：“听到毛主席、朱总司令已下令人民解放军立刻进攻，使我非常兴奋！我们应该立刻把百万大军分头渡过长江去，打到奉化溪口活捉蒋中正。”
    彭泽民：中国农工民主党监委主席彭泽民说：“国民党反动政府拒绝国内和平协定。说明了它决心将反人民的战争进行到底，说明了战犯们的所谓和平是不折不扣的假和平。中国人民为了国家民族的利益，为了一劳永逸的和平，只有一致起来，坚决、勇敢、彻底地消灭战犯集团，消灭一切反动势力，为自由、和平、富强的新中国铺平道路，变帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义所统治的中国为人民民主的中国。正当反动的法国政府限制国际和平代表入法之际，国民党反动集团拒绝国内和平协定，说明了它们的血肉关系，说明了它们一样的是美帝国主义的忠实走狗。但它们连它们的主子一起同样都是纸老虎，无比的中国人民力量再加上世界和平民主的力量，一定会戳破它。
    李章达：人民救国会中常委李章达说：“自从四月一日以来二十天的时间内，中国共产党代表团与南京国民党政府代表团，经过谈判所拟定的国内和平协定，已被南京国民党政府所拒绝。这一协定，是以南京国民党政府所承认之中共提出的八个条件为基础的。而这个作为谈判基础的八个条件，又是全国人民及各民主党派一致赞同和拥护的，就以今天拟定的二十四款而论，也是非常宽大而有利于和平解决中国问题的，今既被南京政府所拒绝，是证明南京政府之所谓承认八条件为和平谈判基础是完全虚伪，绝无用和平方法解决国内问题之诚意。我觉得毛主席朱总司令于四月二十一日所发布的命令是符合人民的要求。唯有这样做去，方能得到全国人民的解放。”
    蔡廷锴：中国国民党民主促进会代主席蔡廷锴说：“毛主席朱总司令下的进军的命令，完全代表了全国人民的意志，答复了人民的要求，华南的人民早已等待着人民解放军渡过长江，解放华南，解放华南人民，我代表中国国民党民主促进会完全同意这个命令，要以最大的努力来支持实现这个命令，以便人民解放军迅速渡江，逮捕一切怙恶不悛的战争罪犯，尤其是捉拿魔王蒋介石由人民审判，把一切反动残余扫得干干净净，及早开新政协，成立真正代表人民的联合政府。”
    陈其尤：中国致公党中央委员会主席陈其尤认为：“毛主席、朱总司令下令解放军渡江，完全符合全国人民的意志，全国人民必然一致为后盾。在短期内京沪解放之后，就要继续向华南胜利进军。华南是我们侨胞的故乡，今日海外华侨处境之恶，已无以复加，侨胞生命财产得以保障，实有赖于中国全面解放，建立新中国的独立自主的外交政策。因此我希望华南同胞，尤其是我致公党同志们，在各方面协助南下大军，为完成新民主主义革命而献出我们的力量。”
