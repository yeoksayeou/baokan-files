Criticism and Suggestions

　　Manufacturing Leader Portraits Must Be Approved
　　Editor Comrade:
　　Recently, a person from Tianjin was seen wearing portraits of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, with the background being a reactionary and traitorous Kuomintang emblem. It is understood that these portraits were purchased from stalls on Chongqing Road in Tianjin. Therefore, it is suggested that the Tianjin municipal authorities should immediately inspect and stop the sale of these portraits, and that all those using portraits of our Party's leaders should be subject to review and approval by a designated agency, in order to prevent unscrupulous merchants who only seek profit and those with ulterior motives from engaging in speculation and sabotage, and from selling and disseminating goods that blur the lines between the enemy and ourselves under the guise of revolution.

　　制领袖像必须经过批准编者同志：
    近见从天津来人，佩有毛、朱领袖像，背景是一面反动的卖国的国民党徽章的底子。据了解，此像系天津重庆道摊子上买的。因此建议天津市当局，应即检查，停止出卖，并对一切使用我党领袖像者，应经一定机关审核并批准，以杜绝唯利是图的奸商和别具用心的人们投机破坏，与在革命外衣下出售与散播模糊敌我界限的货色。
