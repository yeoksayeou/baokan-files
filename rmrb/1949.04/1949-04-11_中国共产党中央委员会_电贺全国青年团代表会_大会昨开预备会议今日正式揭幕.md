    [This Newspaper's Report] The First National Congress of the China New Democratic Youth League, representing 190,000 Youth League members, will officially open in Ping (Beiping) this afternoon (11th). A preparatory meeting was held yesterday, where all 291 delegates present (including 17 alternate delegates) solemnly elected Mao Zedong, Zhu De, Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai, Ren Bishi, Chen Yun, Cai Chang, Liao Chengzhi, Feng Wenbin, Xiao Hua, Hu Qiaomu, Jiang Nanxiang, Ai Siqi, Li Chang, Song Yiping, Huang Hua, Gao Tang, Yang Shu, Han Tianshi, Lu Ping, Luo Yi, Liu Daosheng, Zhang Fan, Feng Taizhen, Gao Jingzhi (female), Zhang Yuying (female), Li Baoguang (female), Chen Jingqian, and Fu Zhenyu (female) as members of the Presidium of the Congress.

    Comrade Feng Wenbin, on behalf of the Preparatory Committee, reported on the preparation process: Due to the active role played by the vast number of advanced youth in the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan and the more than two-year People's Liberation War, and their urgent demand for establishing their own organization, the CPC Central Committee first issued a proposal for a pilot program to establish the League in October 1946. The Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region was the first to respond to the call and began the pilot program. The liberated areas of East China, North China, and Northeast China also gradually promoted it. After more than a year of pilot League building, preliminary results were achieved, which were supported by the vast number of youth, approved by adults, and sponsored by the Party, government, and military. On January 1, 1949, the CPC Central Committee issued a formal decision to establish the League, calling on all liberated areas to universally establish the League. After comprehensively considering the candidates recommended by various parties, 57 people were determined to form the Preparatory Committee. The committee issued a notice to convene the First National Congress, determining the time, place, and qualifications and number of delegates, drafted the report of the Congress, and revised the draft of the League's constitution based on the experience of League building in various regions.

    The Congress is expected to last seven days. The main content includes the political report by Comrade Ren Bishi, the work report by Comrade Feng Wenbin, the report on the draft revision of the League's constitution by Comrade Jiang Nanxiang, and the election of the League's national leading body—the League's Central Committee.

    Finally, the agenda, rules of procedure, and rules of debate of the Congress were adopted, and Song Yiping, Yang Wen, and other thirteen people were elected as members of the Credentials Committee, Gao Tang, Yang Disheng, and other fifteen people were elected as members of the Proposals Examination Committee, and Gao Tang and Ma Yi were elected as Secretary-General and Deputy Secretary-General of the Congress.
