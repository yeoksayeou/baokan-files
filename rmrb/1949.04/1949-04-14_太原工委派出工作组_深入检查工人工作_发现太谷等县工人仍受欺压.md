　　Taiyuan Municipal Work Committee Sends Work Group
    To Conduct In-Depth Inspection of Workers' Work
  　Discovers Workers in Taigu and Other Counties Still Subject to Oppression
    [Jinzhong News] After the merger of the Taiyuan Municipal Party Committee and the Jinzhong District Party Committee, the Work Committee sent a work group of more than 40 people on March 12 to conduct inspections in Pingyao, Taigu, Fenyang and other cities in the second and third districts of Jinzhong. Within ten days, it was discovered that many cities (Fenyang, Taigu, Qingyuan, Xugou, Qixian, Taiyuan County, each with about 1,000 workers) seriously neglected workers' work. Since liberation, worker meetings have not been held even once in more than half a year. Xu Guozhen, a worker representative from Qixian County, requested the county government to hold meetings for workers and organize trade unions, but the county government refused the workers' request on the grounds that there were not enough cadres to allocate. When the work group arrived, the representative wrote a request to the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, asking them to forward it. It read: "It has been more than half a year since the liberation of Qixian County, and the treatment of workers remains the same as before...Workers' lives are gradually becoming difficult. At present, what workers most hope for is to quickly organize a trade union. We request that the superiors allocate capable cadres to relieve the urgent needs of the workers in Qixian." The barbers in Pingyao went on strike due to low wages, demanding a pay increase, but this was not resolved. On March 20, workers at the Dazhong Iron Factory in East Street were preparing to strike due to excessive abuse by the capitalists, and only after the work group arrived was the matter resolved. Due to the neglect of workers, labor protection and improvement of living conditions were out of the question. Therefore, the phenomenon of some private factories dismissing workers without reason, deducting wages, and even beating and scolding them still exists in many places. Bai Jili, the owner of the Bai Jili Cotton Weaving Factory in Taigu, did not pay workers' wages for three months. When the workers went to the street office, the street chief said he did not have time to resolve the issue. The factory owner took the workers to the Cotton Weaving Industry Guild (i.e., the old guild) for processing, and as a result, the workers were only given one dan of millet. The worker was immediately dismissed and, through the industry guild, other factories were prohibited from hiring him. Li Huaiyu, an apprentice at Wanquan Motor Shop, was often beaten and scolded by the shopkeeper. Recently, because he did not cook the rice well, the shopkeeper kicked him in the nose and mouth, causing him to bleed, and then dismissed him. Gong Jinku, a clerk at the Tongshun Cargo Store in Ten Streets, Pingyao, was beaten for no reason by the shopkeeper during the year-end settlement last year after an argument over profit sharing, and was forced to go home on New Year's Day. Recently, the shopkeeper only gave the clerks sorghum noodles every day. When the clerks made a suggestion to the shopkeeper while eating, the shopkeeper snatched the bowl and kicked it far away.
    After the work group's mobilization in the above counties for ten days, the workers have spontaneously formed many groups and sent representatives to demand that the government and the factories resolve the above issues. Due to the active urging of the workers after their awakening, the local leaders are now beginning to pay attention to the work of the workers.

　　太原工委派出工作组
    深入检查工人工作
  　发现太谷等县工人仍受欺压
    【晋中讯】太原市委与晋中区党委合并后，工委于三月十二日派工作组四十余人，深入晋中二、三分区的平遥、太谷、汾阳等城市检查工作。十几天内发现很多城市（汾阳、太谷、清源、徐沟、祁县、太原县，各有一千上下的工人），严重忽视工人工作，从解放以来，半年多未开过一次工人会。祁县工人代表许国珍，曾向县政府要求给工人开会和组织工会，县政府却以干部不敷分配拒绝了工人的要求。当工作组去后，该代表向华北总工会写了一个请示书，让给他转去。上面写道：“祁县自解放以来，已半载有余，对工人始终如前，……工人生活逐渐困难，目下工人最盼者，是赶快组织工会。要求上峰配备有力干部以拯祁县工人之急。”平遥的理发工人，因工资过低，曾罢工要求增资，未得解决。三月二十日，东街大众铁工厂工人，因受资方的虐待太甚，准备罢工，正逢工作组去，才得到解决。由于忽视工人，所以劳动保护与生活改善，就谈不到了。因此一些私营工厂对工人无故解雇，克扣工资，甚至打骂的现象仍然存在很多。太谷白聚礼棉织厂，厂主白聚礼，三个月不给工人发工资，工人找到街公所去，街长说没有时间不能解决。厂主就把工人领到棉织业同业公会（即过去的旧行会）去处理，结果只给了工人小米一石，当时就把该工人开除，并通过其同业公会，让别家都不准雇用。万全车行的学徒李怀玉，经常挨掌柜的打骂。最近因做饭没做好，被掌柜的一脚踢的鼻口流血，后来又把他开除。平遥十街通顺货栈的店员巩金库，在去年年关结帐时，掌柜因分红吵嘴后，没处泄气，无故痛打一顿，并在过年的那天强逼其回家。最近每天给店员只吃高粱面，店员在吃饭时向掌柜提了个意见，被掌柜把碗夺下，一脚踢出很远。
    以上各县工人，在工作组十几天的发动后，都纷纷自动组成很多小组，派出代表，对以上问题正要求政府与各厂方进行解决。由于工人觉悟后的积极督促，各地领导上现对工人工作正在开始注意。
