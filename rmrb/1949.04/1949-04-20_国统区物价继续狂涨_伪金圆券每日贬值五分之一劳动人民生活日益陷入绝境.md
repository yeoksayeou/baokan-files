Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 18th: Prices continue to soar in Kuomintang-controlled areas. In Shanghai, rice was 700,000 (pseudo-Gold Yuan, same below) per shi on the 15th, 960,000 on the 16th, and soared to 1.2 million on the 17th, nearly 60,000 times the price when the Kuomintang pseudo-government implemented "currency reform" last August. In addition to rice, flour rose by 50% on the 17th, cooking oil and coal briquettes rose by 150%, and all other necessities or non-necessities rose uniformly. On the same day, the Kuomintang reactionary government announced a 150% increase in tram and bus fares, a 470% increase in airfares, a 900% increase in train passenger and freight fares, and a 1,500% increase in postage and telegram fees. According to telegraphic reports, in recent times, based on general commodity prices and gold, silver, and US dollars, the average daily devaluation rate of the pseudo-Gold Yuan has reached 20%, and this rate is continuing to increase. Due to the continuous devaluation of the pseudo-Gold Yuan, the number of stores refusing to accept the pseudo-Gold Yuan is increasing daily. With skyrocketing prices, the lives of the laboring people in Shanghai are plunging deeper into despair, and incidents of pseudo-famine victims攔路 robbing rice boats and rice trucks have occurred again. In Fuzhou, prices also doubled on the 15th and 16th.
