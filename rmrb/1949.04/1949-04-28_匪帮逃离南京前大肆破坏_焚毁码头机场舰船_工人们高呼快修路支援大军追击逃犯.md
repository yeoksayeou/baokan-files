Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 26th: Before fleeing Nanjing, the Kuomintang bandit gangs engaged in a frenzy of destruction. It has now been verified that the most severely damaged areas include the Xiaguan docks, the airport, and the Nanjing Railway Station locomotive depot on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway. More than 40 ships docked at Xiaguan Wharf were set on fire, with flames soaring into the sky, turning the entire river red. Many dockworkers refused to participate in the destruction and were injured by the bandit soldiers. The airport warehouse and its stored gasoline and other materials were completely burned. The Nanjing Railway Station locomotive depot on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway was bombed into ruins. The destroyed ships, both large and small, included: Feibo, Feirong, Feixin, Wan'an, Fengxiang, Huayi, Da'an, Dapeng, Dakang, Jichang, Anmaru, Qiangfeng, as well as Landing Craft 14, Post Office Landing Craft 1, and Zhaoshang No. 240 wooden barge. When the workers saw the People's Liberation Army entering Nanjing, they all accused the Kuomintang bandit gangs of their crimes. Zhou Weijing, a worker from the destroyed Feirong, gnashed his teeth and said, "They didn't leave anything good behind even when they were dying!" Railway workers excitedly shouted: Let's cooperate, army and people, and quickly repair the roads to support the People's Liberation Army in pursuing the bandit army and eliminating them one by one.
