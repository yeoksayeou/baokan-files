Nanjing Central University Alumni in Beiping
　　Voice Support for Alma Mater and Nanjing Students

Fellow students of Nanjing Central University, fellow students of Nanjing:

We, the alumni of Central University in Beiping, express our greatest respect for your heroic struggle on April 1st to strive for the realization of true peace. We express our sincere condolences to the deceased alumni of our alma mater, and express our angry protest against the atrocities committed against you by the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary group!

Just as Chiang Kai-shek's die-hard followers are desperately trying to buy time, preparing to stage a comeback and counterattack the people, you, representing the will of the people of China, launched a parade demanding the realization of true peace based on Chairman Mao's eight conditions, but were subjected to such a brutal massacre by the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary group.

You have once again used action, blood, and young lives to write a glorious history, educating the people of China and telling everyone that devils wearing beautiful masks cannot be trusted, and true peace cannot be obtained by luck. The heinous war criminals must be punished.

More than once, our alma mater Central University students, together with Nanjing students and students from all over China, have waged unyielding struggles against the Kuomintang reactionary government. In the "May 20th" anti-hunger movement in 1947, the Chiang Kai-shek group used military police, secret agents, water cannons, machine guns, and cavalry, with six lines of defense, but could not stop us. We were not afraid of bloodshed and continued the struggle. In the "May Fourth" and "May 20th" commemorations in 1948, the "August 19th" blacklist, large-scale disappearances, arrests, and imprisonments, all the persecution did not scare us. The students' struggle was more difficult, but also more heroic and resourceful.

Our Nanjing students and Central University students have occupied a very important page in the history of the student movement. Today, the April 1st massacre has stirred up the people of China. Students, professors, and workers in Beiping and Tianjin have risen up to support you. The people of China are supporting you. Now the powerful People's Liberation Army has drunk water on the banks of the Yangtze River. The days of liberating Nanjing, liberating all of China, and realizing true peace are not far off. The long night has come to dawn. We hope that you will continue to struggle, resolutely launch the movement for true peace, and work together to strive for the early arrival of the liberation of all China.

　　南京中央大学在平校友
  　声援母校及南京同学南京中央大学母校同学们，南京全体同学们：
    我们，中大在北平的校友，对你们四月一日为争取实现真和平的英勇斗争表示最大的敬意。对死难的母校同学表示真挚的慰问，对蒋介石反动集团加于你们的残杀暴行，表示愤怒的抗议！
    恰恰在蒋介石死党正在拼命争取喘息时间，准备卷土重来，向人民反扑的时候，你们代表了全中国的民意，发动了游行，要求实现毛主席八项条件的真正和平，但却受到蒋介石反动集团这样残酷的屠杀。
    你们又一次用行动，用热血，用年青的生命，写下了光荣的历史，教育了全中国人民，告诉大家：戴了美女面目的魔鬼是不能相信的，真正的和平是不能侥幸得到的。穷凶极恶的战争罪犯是必须惩办的。
    不止一次了，我们母校中大同学和南京的同学和全中国的同学一起，向国民党反动政府进行不屈不挠的斗争，一九四七年的“五·二○”反饥饿运动，蒋介石集团用军警，特务，水龙，机枪，马队，六道防线都拦不住我们，我们不怕头破血流，继续斗争；一九四八年的“五四”和“五、二○”纪念，“八、一九”公布的黑名单，大规模的失踪，逮捕和监禁，一切的迫害也没有吓住我们，同学们的斗争虽然更艰苦，但也更英勇更机智。
    我们南京同学，中大同学在学生运动史中占了很重要的一页；今天，四一惨案已经激动了中国的人民，北平天津的广大学生，教授，工人都已经起来支援你们，全中国的人民都在支援你们。现在人民解放军强大部队已饮马扬子江边，解放南京，解放全中国，实现真和平的日子已为期不远，漫漫长夜已经到了黎明的时候了。希望你们继续斗争，坚决展开要求真和平运动，共同努力争取全中国解放的早日到来。
