Central Hebei Expanding Cotton Planting
	2 Million Jin of Seeds Loaned
	And 20 Million Jin of Coal Supplied to Cotton Farmers
[Central Hebei Telegram] In order to realize the plan to increase the production of cotton and peanuts and solve the difficulties of seed supply and fuel for farmers planting cotton, the Agricultural Department of the Central Hebei Administrative Office and the Central Hebei Trading Company jointly agreed to prepare 2 million jin of cotton seeds, 400,000 jin of peanut seeds, and 20 million jin of coal in early March for loan or sale to farmers. On March 16, the Central Hebei Administrative Office issued a notice on lending seeds to the agricultural sections of various prefectures, county governments, and the general and branch stores of the Promotion Society. It instructed the Promotion Societies of various counties to transport the seeds from the districts to the counties by the end of March to ensure that farmers could plant them in time. After the autumn harvest, the Promotion Society will recover raw cotton. One hundred jin of peanut seeds will be provided per mu, and 105 jin of peanuts will be returned, ensuring the quality of the peanuts, and they must be repaid by the end of the Gregorian calendar year. All profits will belong to the Promotion Society. The lending of coal will be controlled by the Central Hebei Trading Company and lent to cotton farmers through the Promotion Societies of Jin County, Gaocheng, Zhao County, and other cotton-producing areas. The current coal price (plus freight) will be converted into cotton, and the corresponding amount of cotton will be paid in the fall.
[Another Telegram] The Eleventh Prefecture of Central Hebei and Yuhua Store recently jointly convened a meeting of the supply and marketing directors of the Promotion Societies of various counties to discuss how to repay cotton for coal loans. The Promotion Societies of Wuji and Shenze counties in the Ninth Prefecture have also sent cadres deep into the masses to discuss specific methods for repaying cotton for coal loans.
