  　Jizhong Industrial Company Factory Workers
  　Strengthen Research After Returning from Tianjin Visit

    [Our Dispatch] After workers, technicians, and staff from various factories under the Jizhong Industrial Company visited Tianjin, they are enthusiastically studying how to improve technology and the quality of finished products. In early March, the company organized ten key personnel (managers, technicians, and experienced workers) from its directly affiliated Yonghua, Julong, and Wanju factories, divided into machinery, match, chemical, and leather-making groups, led by company manager Zhou Boyi, to visit Tianjin. During the first six days in Tianjin, they visited sixteen public and private factories involved in matches, oil extraction, machinery, chemicals, salt, pigments, paints, and sulfuric acid. During the visits, each group adopted a very humble and responsible attitude, focusing on different key aspects based on the nature and characteristics of their respective factories. They visited, interviewed, and explored and compared aspects of industrial management, technological improvement, raw material sourcing, finished product quality, and cost accounting. They critically adopted relevant experiences and meticulously recorded or drew charts. Because everyone was using their brains to learn from each other's strengths and compensate for their weaknesses, they gained a lot. After returning to their factories at the end of March, each group enthusiastically and confidently studied improvement plans for their respective factories. After returning to the Julong Iron Factory, the technicians convened a meeting of all factory staff, union cadres, and skilled technical workers to report on the visit and decided to gradually improve production methods based on the existing foundation. Currently, the first step is to improve the axle sets, retainers, and sights for carts. In April, they will install a threading machine to improve the current axle rubbing technique. Then, depending on the situation, they will add more complex tools such as broaching machines and plan to manufacture oil press parts, new-style nail-making machines, and silent horse chains. Preparations for raw materials and detailed drawings have already begun. Veteran worker Zhou Kaigan excitedly said, "The factory makes machines, the workers can learn new technologies, and everyone has more energy." Zhang Ling, a veteran worker of over twenty years, gesticulated and said in a loud voice, "This visit has opened my mind." He had completed the repair of an incomplete gas engine that had not been running for ten years before March, and now he will make even greater efforts to improve his skills. According to Sun Weihan, director of the Yonghua Chemical Factory: Using the same raw materials and coal, the Dafen Factory in Tianjin produces 100 cylinders of sodium sulfide per furnace per day, while we produce only 80 cylinders per day with two furnaces and an extra shift of workers, because our furnaces are small and cannot utilize waste heat. However, our raw material and fuel sourcing are cheaper than in Tianjin, and sales are not a problem. As long as we modify the alkali furnace, add a grate, and change the coal inlet to the front top to ensure adequate ventilation, we may be able to catch up with Tianjin's daily output. Other factories involved in oil extraction, matches, and leather-making have also gained many insights and are studying improvements. The impression gained from this visit is that small factories established during the war, from nothing to something, from small to large, have many excellent styles of work, but their technology urgently needs to be improved.

　　改进工业技术
  　冀中实业公司各厂职工
  　天津参观归来加强研究
    【本报讯】冀中实业公司领导下各厂工人、技师、职员赴津参观后，热烈研究改进技术与提高成品质量。该公司于三月初组织直属永华、聚隆、万聚各厂主要负责人（经理、技师和有经验的工人）十名，分为机器、火柴、化学、制革等组，由公司经理周伯易带领，赴天津参观。在津前六天，参观了火柴、榨油、机器、化学、盐业、颜料、油漆、硫酸等十六个公营与私营工厂。参观时，各组都以非常虚心负责态度，根据本厂性质与特点，各自确定不同重点，一面参观，一面访问，并对工务管理、技术改良、原料取给、成品质量及成本核算等，都加以探讨与比较；批判地接受了与自己有关经验，且详细纪录或绘下图表。正由于大家都很用脑筋取长补短，所以得到不少收获。各组于三月底回厂后，均以高度热情与信心，研究各厂改进方案。聚隆铁工厂技师回厂后，召开全厂职员、工会干部和熟练的技术工人会议，报告参观经过，并决定在原有基础上逐渐改良生产方法。目前首先将车子轴组套挡、套母、视眼加以改进。在四月份按好一盘套丝床，改进现在的搓轴技术。然后，看情况增设拨丝床等较复杂工具，并计划制造榨油机机件，新式砸钉机及闷马链等。现已开始筹备原料，详细绘图。老工人周凯乾兴奋地说：“工厂造机器，工人可以学新的技术，大家更有劲了。”二十多年的老工人张凌＠手舞足蹈，以宏亮的声音说：“我这回参观可打开脑筋了”。他曾在三月前完成了一部残缺不全十年未开动的瓦斯机修理工作，现在他要以更大努力改进技术。据永华化学厂厂长孙维汉谈：同样原料与煤炭，天津大烽工厂一个炉日产硫化碱一百筒，我们两个炉还多一班工人，仅日产八十筒，原因就是炉灶小，不能利用余热。但我们原料与燃料取给上比天津还便宜些，销路亦不成问题。只要改造一下碱炉，加上炉床，添煤口改到正面上方，使通风充足，即有可能赶上天津每日产量。其他榨油、火柴、制革等厂都得到许多启示，正在研究改进中。从这次参观得到的印象是：在战争中建立起来的，由无到有、由小到大的小型工厂，具有很多优良作风；但在技术上急待改进。
