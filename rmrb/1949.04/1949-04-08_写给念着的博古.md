　　Writing to the Beloved Bogu
    Zhang Yuexia
    Bogu: It has been three years since you left the children and me. In the past two years, the 4/8 Incident saw the head war criminal Chiang Kai-shek, Hu Zongnan, and others launch a full-scale barbaric war to attack the liberated areas, and a large-scale offensive against the democratic sanctuary of Yan'an. The people of the liberated areas suffered burning, killing, stabbing, looting, and rape. Your children, like the children of the people, could not concentrate on going to school when the war criminal Hu Zongnan's army attacked Anse. They were only nine or ten years old, carrying small luggage, and marched from Anse to Wu'an. The lovely Xinhua even helped smaller classmates with laundry and other things during the long march. She has become a model member of the Children's Corps. In such tense days of struggle, we could not find a stable place to commemorate you. Thinking of this, my tears of grief are hard to suppress.
    Bogu: The news of the imminent nationwide victory comforts you, who are sleeping underground. The war criminals deeply feel their collapse is at hand, and under the direction of American imperialism, they are using their cunning tricks, secretly deploying new wars while hypocritically chanting "peace" slogans, to gain a chance to catch their breath and attempt to confuse the people in the Kuomintang-controlled areas. But Bogu: the people's minds are clear. The people across the country support Chairman Mao's eight peace conditions. From my personal experience, only the realization of Chairman Mao's eight peace conditions can lead to true peace. Let me illustrate with historical facts! As early as the autumn of 1927, I personally witnessed these war criminals in Hangzhou slaughtering students and young people who helped the Kuomintang develop and establish itself. In 1939, in Guangdong, they secretly slaughtered male and female students who were mobilizing the people to raise donations for the Kuomintang army and support the war. In January 1941, they declared General Ye Ting, who had contributed to the anti-Japanese cause, a traitor. Bogu! I also remember you, Dong Lao, Deng Dajie, and other councilors, starting from 1938, during the anti-Japanese stage, striving to do everything possible to adhere to the goal of anti-Japanese democracy and engage in activities in the Political Participation Council, combating conspiracies and remarks that compromised with Japan, until you were forced to leave Chongqing and return to Yan'an in December 1940 because you could no longer carry out these activities. After Japan surrendered, our Chairman Mao personally went to Chongqing for peace talks. Later, in order to realize the people's desire for peace, Wang Ruofei, you, and others flew to Chongqing again. You also guided the Chongqing Xinhua Daily on how to serve the people's cause of peace under the Kuomintang's news blockade. You were running for the sake of national peace until your death. Furthermore, if it were not for the reactionary Kuomintang group's lack of sincerity for peace, which prevented the realization of the 1946 Political Consultative Conference resolution, increasing your trips between Chongqing and Yan'an, you could have avoided that plane crash and avoided accidental tragic death. Are these facts not enough to illustrate the Kuomintang's attitude towards peace? I remember very deeply the war criminal Chiang Kai-shek's group's hatred of the people and their strangulation of the people's livelihood. We all know their dog-like thoughts, their few dog intestines, and we have learned the bloody lessons very clearly. Therefore, I firmly support Chairman Mao's eight peace conditions and will not allow any of them to be abandoned. Today, as I commemorate your death, I feel the pain of you leaving the children and me. I must also speak for you and insist on Chairman Mao's eight peace conditions on your behalf. I not only said this today in commemorating you, but also widely told the people of Beiping during my participation in the peaceful takeover of Beiping, and I will continue to say so in the future. Only by doing so can I alleviate the pain in my heart.
    Bogu: Today, three years after your death, we commemorate you in the eternally peaceful Beiping. The new Political Consultative Conference will soon be held in Beiping, and a democratic coalition government will be established. Such epoch-making victory news will be the best gift to commemorate you. I believe you will be very happy.

　　写给念着的博古
    张月霞
    博古：你离开小孩们和我已经三年了，前两个年头的四八，由于头等战犯蒋介石胡宗南等发动全面地进攻解放区的野蛮战争，大举进攻民主圣地——延安，解放区的老百姓遭到烧杀、戳掠、奸淫的灾难。你的几个孩子，和人民的子弟遭遇一样，当战犯胡宗南军队进攻安塞时，他们不能安心的上学校，他们只九岁、十岁，背着小行装，由安塞长征到武安，可爱的新华，在长征的遥远路程中还帮助比她更小的同学洗衣等事情，她已成为模范儿童团员，在这样紧张的斗争时日里，我们得不到一个安定的地方，来纪念你们，想念到这里我的悲痛的眼泪是难以禁抑的。
    博：全国很快要胜利的消息告慰长眠在地下的你。战犯们深感到它们的崩溃在即，又在美帝国主义的指使下，施行它的狡猾技俩，一面秘密地布置新的战争，一面假唱“和平”高调，以取得喘息狗命的机会，并企图借此以迷糊国民党统治区的人民。但是博：人民的头脑是清醒的，全国人民都拥护毛主席的八项和平条件，从我的切身体会，也只有毛主席的八项和平条件实现，才能谈到真正的和平、让我以历史的事实来说明吧！远在一九二七年秋，我在杭州亲自见到这伙战犯们屠杀帮助国民党发展和建立的学生青年，一九三九年在广东秘密屠杀从事动员人民为国民党军队而募捐慰劳支援战争的男女学生，一九四一年一月将我们抗日有功的叶挺将军宣布为叛逆。博！我更记得你和董老邓大姐等几位参政员，从一九三八年起，在抗日阶段，就努力于想尽一切办法为坚持抗日民主的目标而从事参政会中的活动，打击与日本妥协的阴谋和言论，直至一九四○年十二月被迫不能再活动而离渝回到延安。日本投降后，我们的毛主席亲临重庆进行和平谈判，后来又为实现人民的和平要求，王若飞和你等又飞渝，你并指导重庆的新华日报，如何在国民党的新闻封锁下，为人民的和平事业服务，你为全国和平一直奔走到死，再进一步说，假若不是反动国民党集团，对和平没有诚意，使得一九四六年的政协决议不能实现，增加你们飞渝飞延的奔跑，你们可以避免那次飞机的失事，可以免去意外的惨死。这些事实还不足够说明国民党对和平是什么态度吗？战犯蒋介石集团仇恨人民的事迹，扼杀人民生路的事实，我记得很深，它们的狗心思，几条狗肚肠，血的教训使我们都数得很清，因此我坚决拥护毛主席的八项和平条件，不容许放弃任何一条，我今天纪念你们的死难，我心痛你离开孩子们和我，我更要代你们说话，代你们坚持毛主席的八项和平条件，我不仅在纪念你的今天说了，我在参加和平接管北平工作中，广泛地告诉北平的人民，而且以后还要这样说，只有这样做，才能减轻我心中的痛苦。
    博：你们死后三年的今天，我们在永远和平的北平纪念你们，很快在北平就要召开新的政协会议，成立民主联合政府，这样的划历史时代的胜利消息，将是纪念你们的最好礼物，相信你会很高兴。
