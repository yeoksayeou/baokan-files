    Philippine People's Anti-Japanese Army—After the outbreak of the Pacific War, in March 1942, the US military was forced to withdraw from the Philippines under pressure from the Japanese imperialist army. At that time, the Communist Party of the Philippines led the people to organize the "People's Anti-Japanese Army" and persisted in fighting against Japan. In three years, it went through more than 1,200 battles, large and small, killing more than 25,000 enemies. The People's Anti-Japanese Army became a people's armed force with 30,000 regular troops and 50,000 reserves. After Japan surrendered, American imperialism returned to the Philippines. Its agent, Philippine "President" Roxas, attempted to use the trick of "peace talks" and American planes, heavy artillery, and flamethrowers to eliminate the People's Anti-Japanese Army. However, these conspiracies and tricks were all defeated. The strength of the People's Anti-Japanese Army is growing day by day, and liberated areas have been established in the central and southern parts of Luzon Island, such as Bulacan Province.
