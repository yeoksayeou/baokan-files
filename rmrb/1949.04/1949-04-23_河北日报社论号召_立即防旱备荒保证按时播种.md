Jizhong Telegram: Currently, most areas of the Jizhong region are experiencing severe drought, which poses the biggest obstacle to spring plowing and sowing. To address this, the Hebei Daily published an editorial on the 17th of this month entitled "Immediately Take Action to Prevent Drought and Prepare for Famine to Ensure Timely Completion of Planting," which stated in part: The Jizhong Great Production Movement has been initially launched, and preliminary achievements have been made in mobilizing and organizing the masses to prepare for spring plowing and sowing. However, the implementation of this year's production plan is not yet thorough or widespread. From cadres to the masses, there is a relatively common mentality of relying on Heaven for food. Until recently, many areas were still poorly prepared for drought prevention, famine preparation, and timely sowing. People are unsure how to proceed with further implementation to every household and individual, especially how to specifically organize the masses to prevent drought, prepare for famine, carry water for spot planting, and overcome difficulties to defeat natural disasters. All localities must overcome these shortcomings, urgently carry out ideological mobilization for drought prevention and famine preparation, and widely conduct propaganda and education to break the mentality of relying on Heaven for food and waiting for luck among cadres and the masses, and establish a strong confidence in overcoming the spring drought (but do not carry this out in flooded or waterlogged areas). Party committees at all levels must not be complacent in their leadership and must first clear the thinking of cadres in order to enhance the confidence of the masses in drought prevention. According to the experience of Qingyuan, in the past six or seven days, six villages have dug a total of twenty-two earth wells, five earth pits, and six cone wells. Each earth well requires only three workdays, and if water is carried for spot planting, one earth well can supply water for more than twenty mu of surrounding land, even for five or six mu of shady land. In the black soil areas of eastern Jizhong, such as Renqiu, Hejian, and Dacheng, it is said that digging an earth well only takes six or seven workdays. If each three households can dig at least one earth well on average, even if it doesn't rain, they can at least carry water for spot planting (mainly cotton, peanuts, and yams, etc.). Localities should, based on their specific local conditions, use these facts to mobilize the masses for specific organization and planning, and patiently persuade the masses: "Missing the season means starving for a year." The less it rains, the sooner you must start. As long as you can plant and protect the spring seedlings, there is hope for an autumn harvest. As long as the whole party and all the people make various efforts, we can overcome natural disasters and complete this year's production plan. To prevent drought, prepare for famine, and realize the production increase plan, the following five specific tasks should be grasped at present: (1) Widely mobilize the masses to build waterwheels and wells. In all irrigated areas, immediately organize the masses to plant seeds in shady areas. In dryland areas, mobilize people as soon as possible to dig earth wells and earth pits, and prepare water wheels and buckets for carrying water for spot planting. Distinguish between urgent and less urgent matters and use resources in a focused manner. All spring drought areas should widely organize mutual assistance among the masses, launch a movement to dig earth wells, and mobilize women, children, and all able-bodied and semi-able-bodied laborers to engage in sowing, carrying water, spot planting, and other field production. (2) Urgently distribute seeds, especially cotton and peanut seeds. Currently, various special districts and counties have accumulated a lot of seeds, which must be organized for lending immediately. Party committees and governments at all levels should conduct in-depth investigations on this matter. If the planting season is missed, the responsibility should be investigated. At the same time, vigorously mobilize the masses to lend to each other to ensure that seeds are prepared before sowing. (3) Plan to prepare and clear land: Plan in advance which land to plant cotton and which land to plant peanuts. As soon as it is time to sow, immediately start planting seedlings in shady areas. Particularly for cotton and peanut fields, preparations should be made as early as possible. (4) This spring is dry, and disasters may spread. Localities should earnestly advocate selecting and soaking seeds to prevent diseases and insect pests during sowing. (5) Launch weeding of wheat, prevent black rust, and eliminate spider mite pests. Finally, party committees at all levels must provide unified leadership based on local conditions, organize all possible cadres, organize work teams, go deep into the countryside, lead the masses, and quickly launch various specific measures for drought prevention and famine preparation. All other levels and departments should focus their work around production. Whether we can lead the masses to do a good job in drought prevention, famine preparation, and timely sowing will be an important test of our ability to lead the masses in production.

　　河北日报社论号召
  　立即防旱备荒保证按时播种
    【冀中电】目前冀中区大部地区天旱严重，成为春耕播种的最大困难。为此，河北日报以“立即动手防旱备荒，保证按时完成播种”为题，于本月十七日发表社论略称：冀中大生产运动已经初步开展，在发动组织群众做好春耕播种的各种准备工作中，亦已获得初步成绩。但今年生产计划的贯彻还不够深入与普遍，从干部到群众比较普遍的存在着靠天吃饭思想，直到最近，很多地区对于防旱备荒、按时播种的实际准备仍然很差。对如何深入一步贯彻到每一户每一个人，特别是怎样具体组织群众防旱备荒、挑水点种，克服困难战胜天灾，则表现不知如何着手。各地必须克服这些缺点，紧急进行防旱备荒的思想动员，广泛展开宣传教育，打破干部与群众中存在的靠天吃饭思想和等待侥幸心理，树立战胜春旱的坚强信心（但对水灾区脱水地区则不要去进行）。各级党委在领导上对此不能有所麻痹，必须首先打通干部思想，才能增强群众防旱的信心。根据清苑的经验，在最近六、七天内，六个村共挖土井二十二眼、土坑五眼、锥井六眼，按每个土井合计不过用三个整工，如果挑水点种，一个土井能供给周围二十多亩地使水，即便浇水阴地也够五、六亩地使用。在冀中东部任邱、河间、大城等黑土地区，据说挖一眼土井也不过六七个工。各地如果能做到至少平均每三家伙挖一眼土井，即使不下雨，至少可以做到挑水点种（主要是棉花、花生、山药等）。各地应根据当地具体情况，以这些事实发动群众进行具体组织筹划，向群众耐心说服：“节令错过，一年挨饿”，越不下雨越要及早下手。只要能种上，保住春苗，就有秋收希望。只要全党全民进行各种努力，是能够战胜天灾完成今年生产计划的。防旱备荒，实现增产计划，目前应抓住以下五个具体工作：（一）应广泛发动群众修建水车、水井、在一切水浇地区，立即组织群众阴地播种。在旱地地区应尽先动员赶挖土井、土坑，制备辘辘水斗，以备挑水点种。要分清缓急，有重点地使用力量。各春旱地区，应广泛组织群众互助，展开挖土井运动，发动妇女儿童及所有整、半劳动力。投入播种挑水，点种等田间生产。（二）紧急发放种籽，特别是棉花、花生种籽。目前各专区、县积存种籽很多，必须立即组织贷放。各级党委及政府对此应深入调查，如果误了农时不及种植，应当追究责任。同时要大力发动群众互相借贷，保证在播种前把种籽准备好。（三）有计划的整地、腾地：事先计划好那块地种棉花，那块地种花生，一到播种时，立即动手阴地按苗；特别是棉花和花生地，应及早准备。（四）今春天旱，灾害可能蔓延，各地在播种时要切实提倡选种、浸种预防病虫害。（五）发动锄麦，防除黑疸，消灭火蛛子虫害。最后，各级党委必须根据当地情况统一领导，组织一切可能抽调的干部，组织工作队，深入乡村，领导群众，迅速展开防旱备荒的各项具体措施。其他各级各部门工作，都应围绕生产进行。能否领导群众做好防旱备荒，按时播种点种，将是我们领导群众生产有无能力的重要考验。
