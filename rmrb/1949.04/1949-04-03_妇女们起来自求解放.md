　　Women Arise to Seek Liberation Themselves
    Since this newspaper published Ms. Huang Piao's letter, it has immediately aroused enthusiastic concern from readers in this city for Ms. Huang Piao, who have written one after another, entrusting this newspaper to forward them to Ms. Huang Piao. The deep sympathy of the readers deeply inspires the colleagues of this newspaper! Therefore, publishing their letters, as the readers said, is by no means just Ms. Huang Piao's problem, but a major issue of the liberation of thousands upon thousands of women in China.
    Beiping is a feudal fortress with a long history of tradition. Since the end of the Qing Dynasty, it has been directly devastated by imperialism and the comprador bourgeoisie. It is already difficult for urban workers and poor urban women to maintain their lives, and if their economy cannot be independent, it will naturally be difficult to get rid of family persecution. The so-called "equality between men and women" under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang can only be empty talk.
    Today, Beiping has been liberated. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, imperialism, feudal warlords, and the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang have been overthrown, and feudal vestiges will also be completely eliminated. Women's liberation must be thoroughly realized. To solve this problem, women must organize under the leadership of the Communist Party and resolutely fight against feudal forces and feudal traditions. What is especially important is that they must enter the production front to seek economic independence.
    Our publishing these letters is not only to express deep sympathy, but especially to hope that readers will further discuss this issue: How to relieve women of these pains? How to truly achieve women's liberation? What are the reasons why Ms. Huang Piao has been oppressed by feudal families for a long time? How to carry out women's work in the city in the future? How can women achieve economic independence? We hope that all readers will express their opinions on all these issues, and especially hope that female workers in factories will discuss them in study groups or in conversations with several people, and write their opinions to this newspaper.

　　妇女们起来自求解放
    自本报发表了黄飘女士的来信后，立即就引起了本市读者对黄飘女士的热情关怀，纷纷来信，托本报代为转达黄飘女士。读者此种深厚同情，本报同仁，亦深感奋！因此，登载了她们的来信，诚如读者所说，这决不是黄飘女士一个人的问题，而是全中国千千万万妇女解放的大问题。
    北平是一个有长时期传统的封建堡垒，清末以来又直接遭受帝国主义和买办资产阶级的摧残，城市工人、贫苦市民妇女，生活尚难维持，经济不能独立，当然也难于摆脱家庭的迫害，国民党反动统治下的所谓“男女平等”，只能是一句空谈。
    今天北平已经解放，在共产党的领导下，帝国主义、封建军阀、和国民党反动统治已被推翻，封建遗毒亦将彻底扫除，妇女解放必须彻底实现，要解决这一问题，必须在共产党领导下，妇女们组织起来坚决与封建势力、封建传统作斗争，尤其重要的，必须走入生产战线谋求经济的独立。
    我们发表这些来信，不仅是为了表示深切的同情，而尤其希望读者根据这个问题，更进一步展开讨论，如何解除妇女这些痛苦？如何真正求得妇女的解放？黄飘女士的长期受到封建家庭的压迫，原因何在？今后如何开展城市中的妇女工作？妇女在经济上如何才能求得独立？所有这些问题，我们希望读者大家都来发表自己的意见，尤其希望工厂中的女工同志在学习小组中，或者在几个人的交谈中，加以讨论，并将讨论的意见写给本报。
