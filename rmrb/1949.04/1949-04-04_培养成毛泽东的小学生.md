　　Cultivating Little Students to Become Mao Zedong
    Du Chen
    When we first came to this new district—the Eighteenth District of Beiping—the western suburbs, we proposed the principle of democratic management, requiring teachers in all schools to abolish corporal punishment. Many teachers doubted whether democratic management could be implemented. If children are not scolded and corporal punishment is not allowed, how can they be made to obey order? This kind of thinking existed for a long time and has not been completely eliminated even now. However, due to the facts, everyone's thinking has gradually undergone a new change.
    The Eighteenth District Central National School, after the beginning of this semester, began to experiment according to the methods we proposed. After a month and a half of effort, preliminary results have been achieved. Today, every child in this school has the habit and understanding of criticism and self-criticism, every child dares to frankly confess their mistakes in front of the masses, and also dares to criticize others. We can see children conducting self-examination collectively or in small groups in classrooms without teachers. They do not have the same concerns and face-saving attitudes as adults, and they criticize each other very frankly and straightforwardly. Since its implementation, most teachers believe that this method is very good. Mr. Zhang, the grade teacher of Class Six B, said: "Now it is much easier than before. Now in the classroom, even if there is no teacher, it is quieter than when there was a teacher before." Mr. Gong, a teacher in the first grade, said: "I never thought that these children could manage themselves!" Undoubtedly, the teachers of the Eighteenth District Central National School have led the students to establish a system of criticism and self-criticism, which is the best way to cultivate children to become Mao Zedong and to develop children's autonomy. However, this is only the beginning of democratic management, and there are still many shortcomings that need to be continuously improved in the process of practice. How exactly did they start doing it? "Everything is difficult at the beginning," especially for students who have been under pressure for a long time. It is not easy to restrain themselves when external constraints are relaxed for a while; this poses a big challenge to this work, and teachers' thinking cannot be figured out for a while. Therefore, at this time, it is necessary to first get the teachers' thinking straight. We took the children in the liberated areas as an example to illustrate that children have the ability to be autonomous and creative. Then, the teachers went to each class to mobilize, explaining that it was wrong for teachers to beat and scold children in the past; from now on, everyone should manage themselves. How to manage? That is to implement a system of criticism. Then, encourage one or two active children in the class to take the initiative to make self-criticism in front of the public, talk about their shortcomings, and then other students offer opinions. At the beginning, the children were not used to it, but after one or two times, everyone actively spoke up and took turns making self-examinations in front of everyone.
    The teachers have created many different methods. Some teachers divided the whole class into many groups, and each group elected a group leader (mostly students with better grades). The group leader leads the self-criticism meeting and makes records. During the small group self-criticism process, we can see that the children are very carefully criticizing each other. Don't underestimate the children in the first, second, and third grades, they can do the same. Some teachers also lead by example, allowing the children to criticize themselves, which makes the children more courageous in conducting self-criticism. What should be done with students who admit their mistakes but do not correct them? Some teachers write their names on the blackboard in the class until they are corrected. After continuous experimentation and exploration by the teachers of the central school, they finally achieved today's results.
    In general, the teachers of the Eighteenth District Central Elementary School are working hard in a new direction. However, during this month and a half of experimentation, there have also been some deviations: First, the leadership is not enough. Individual teachers misunderstood that democratic management is laissez-faire, so there is a phenomenon of drift in the progress of self-criticism meetings. Second, only criticizing shortcomings, not promoting advantages; therefore, more encouragement and praise should be given to exemplary children. Third, the criticism is too trivial, so that the students' criticism is limited to "He spoke during class", "He kicked me" and other trivial matters, and their understanding of the problem should be gradually improved, otherwise it will become a formality. Some more naughty students can frankly admit their mistakes in front of everyone, but do not change afterwards. Over time, criticism will lose its effect, and this point should be paid special attention to. Fourth, do not be too strict, or criticize inappropriately, so that some children cannot bear it, but will lose the positive effect of transforming children's thinking.
    Today is the first Children's Day after the liberation of Beiping. When commemorating Children's Day, it is not enough to shout slogans about raising the status of children and respecting children's personality. We should more actively enlighten and educate children, give play to their initiative and creativity, and be a new Mao Zedong's elementary school student.

　　培养成毛泽东的小学生
    杜琛
    当我们刚来到这个新区——北平第十八区，——西郊一带的时候，我们提出了管理民主的原则，要求各校教师废除体罚。很多教师怀疑管理民主是否可以实行，儿童没人骂，又不准体罚，那能使儿童们遵守秩序？这种思想存在了好久，至今还没有全部消除。可是由于事实的证明，大家的思想已经渐渐有了一个新的变化。
    十八区中心国民学校，当这学期开学以后，便根据我们提出的办法试验。经过一个半月的努力，已获得初步的成果。今天，这个学校里每一个儿童都有了批评与自我批评的习惯和认识，每一个儿童都敢于在群众面前坦白地说出自己的错过，也勇于批评别人。我们可以看见在没有教师的教室里，儿童们会集体地或分小组地进行检讨。他们没有象成人那样的顾虑和爱面子，很坦白很直爽地互相批评着。实行以来，一般教师都认为这个办法很好，六乙的级任教员张先生说：“现在比从前省事多了，现在在教室里，就是没有老师在，也比从前有老师在的时候安静。”一年级的教员龚先生说：“想不到这些儿童真能管理自己！”无疑地，十八区中心国民学校的教师们已经领导着学生建立了批评与自我批评的制度，是培养做个毛泽东的儿童和养成儿童自治最好的办法。但这只是管理民主的萌芽，其中还有很多缺点，仍须在实践的过程中不断地改善。他们究竟是怎样开始做的呢？“万事起头难”，尤其是久在压力之下的学生、一时放松了外力的约束，要自己约束自己是不容易的；这就给了这工作一个很大的难题，教员的思想也一时想不通。所以这时要首先打通教员的思想，我们拿解放区的儿童做例子，说明儿童是有自治与创造能力的。然后由各教师到各班去动员，说明过去教师打骂儿童的不对；今后要大家自己管理自己。怎样管理呢？就是实行批评制度。然后鼓励本班一两个积极的儿童，自动地在大众面前首先作自我批评，把自己的缺点说一说，然后由其他同学提意见。开始时儿童们还不习惯，一两次以后大家发言便踊跃起来了，经常地轮流在大家面前作检讨。
    教师们创造了许多不同的方式，有的教师把全班分成许多组，每组选出一个组长（大部是功课比较好的同学）。由组长领导开检讨会，并作纪录。在小组检讨的过程中，我们可以看见孩子们都很慎重地互相批评着，不要小看一、二、三年级的孩子们，他们也一样能够这样作。有的教师并以身作则，也让孩子批评自己，这就使孩子们更勇于在进行自我批评。对承认了错误而不改的同学怎样办呢？有的教师就在班中的黑板上写下他的名字，直到改过后才擦掉。经过中心学校的教师们不断地试验摸索，终于得到了今天这样的成果。
    在总的方面看来，十八区中心小学的教师们正在朝着新的方向努力。但在这一个半月的试验过程中，也有若干偏向：第一是领导得不够，个别的教师误解管理民主就是放任，因此在检讨会的进行中，有自流的现象。第二是只批评缺点，不发扬优点；因此还应该多鼓励表扬模范儿童。第三，是批评过于琐碎，使学生们的批评只限于“他上课时说话”，“他踢了我一下”等等的小事，还应该逐渐提高他们对问题的认识，否则就会流于形式。有些较顽皮的学生，在众人面前能够很坦白的认错，但事后却不改。久而久之，批评就会失去作用，这一点是要特别注意的。第四，是不要过于严厉，或者批评不恰当，使有些儿童受不了，反而会失去作为改造儿童思想的积极作用。
    今天是北平解放后第一个儿童节，在纪念儿童节时，光空喊提高儿童地位，尊重儿童人格是不够的。我们更应该积极地启发教育儿童，发挥他们的自动性与创造力，做一个新的毛泽东的小学生。
