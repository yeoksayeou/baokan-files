　　Seventh Arsenal Sixth Institute
    Successfully Improves Grinding Machine
    [Ping City News] The Sixth Institute of the Seventh Arsenal has successfully improved the grinding machine (commonly known as a grinder) bed linkage device. It is said that the grinding machine is currently one of the most precise tools, but Fu Wan’yu, a lathe operator at the factory, believed that the bed linkage device had two shortcomings: 1. The reciprocating motion of the bed is driven by the principle of the crank motion of a train. The workpiece on the bed is reciprocated at different speeds through connecting rods, resulting in a very imprecise grinding surface. 2. The shortest reciprocating stroke is currently three inches, while the practical amount of the workpiece is less than one inch, which means that the non-working time gap is too long. It is necessary to change the uneven speed of the reciprocating motion into an average speed and shorten the distance of the reciprocating stroke. Therefore, under the factory director's call to "improve tools," workers have been actively researching improvement methods.
    Worker Zhang Kun used a thin iron sheet to mark the distances of several axes, the center point, and the outer circumference of the gear, carefully considering the shape and size of each part. Liu Shijie and others were also studying another machine (the improvement process was carried out simultaneously with work). In the middle, three small gears, a gear frame, a small rocker arm, a rack, and other small parts were added.
    But there were still problems. Later, engineer Jiang Guanhong discovered that its problem was that when the rack changed direction of motion, the small rocker arm had not completely passed, and the transmission gear had disengaged from the driving gear, so two more "Klopings" had to be installed. After two weeks of research, the difficulty was finally overcome, the speed was also averaged, and the stroke distance could be shortened to one inch. In the past, grinding a leak plate took three hours, but now it can be completed in less than one and a half hours. The precision has also been greatly improved. (Xiaolin, Dahu)

　　七十兵工厂六所
    改进研磨机成功
    【平市讯】七十兵工厂第六所改进研磨机（俗称磨床子）床面联动装置成功。按研磨机是现在最精密的一种工具，但该厂车工傅万煜认为床面联动装置有两个缺点：一、推动床面往复运动，是利用火车拐轴运动原理。床面上的工作物经过联杆，用不同的速度往复推动，研磨的表面结果很不精确。二、往复最短的行程现在够三寸，而工作物实用量不足一寸，也就是非工作时间空隙太长，必须把往复运动的不均速度，改成平均速度，再缩短往复行程的距离。因之，在厂长“改进工具”的号召下，工人纷纷钻研改进方法。
    工人张锟以一块薄铁片，划上几个轴的距离，中心点和齿轮外经线，仔细考虑每个零件的形状尺寸。刘式杰等也在另一架机器上研究。（改进过程是一面工作一面研究的）。中间，曾加添装置三个小齿轮，一个齿轮架子，一个小摆杆，一个齿条和其它小零件。
    但仍有毛病。后来工程师蒋观洪发现了它的病源是当齿条变换方向运动时，小摆杆还没有完全过去，而传动的齿轮，就脱离了主动齿轮，必须再装两个“克崩”。经两星期的研究，困难终于被征服了，速度也平均了，行程距离也能缩短成一寸了。过去磨一个漏盘要用三小时，现在不到一个半小时就完成了。精密程度也提高不少。（小林、大虎）
