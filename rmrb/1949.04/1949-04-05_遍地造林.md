　　Afforestation Everywhere
    ▲Farmers along the Baima River in Xingtai are enthusiastically planting trees. In Wangjiazhuang, Shixiang Village, and the northern Wangduan Village alone, 2,550 trees have been planted. Cadres from the Xingtai Bureau of Agriculture and Forestry are also personally visiting various villages to provide guidance. (Wang Tai)
    ▲In Gaomiao Village, Sixth District of Shahe, under the active leadership of village chief Liu Qiming, 2,852 trees were planted in three days. In the eleven villages of the district, a total of more than 27,000 trees were planted in five days. (Qiao Fengshu)
    ▲As of now, Yixian County has planted more than 117,000 trees, according to statistics from ninety villages. (Zan Tang, Shu Zhuang, Jiao Ye)
    ▲Xushui County designated the period from the Spring Equinox to Qingming as an afforestation blitz week. According to statistics from eight districts, 48,392 trees have been planted so far. (Li Chen)
    ▲On the 12th, the Second District of Heshun County convened 26 members of the district's forestry and animal husbandry committee to exchange experiences in planting and protecting forests in the three years since liberation, and to study how to lead the masses to participate in this year's afforestation movement. (Jin Guang, Yu Tang)
    ▲There are a total of 190,000 mu of sandy wasteland within Xinle County. The county party committee plans to strive to plant 950,000 trees this year. Hejiazhuang has adopted a method of free grouping, using saplings, manpower, and land as shares for joint operation. Jia Shuan, a representative from the village, introduced the benefits he and six other families had previously gained from planting three rows of trees, which protected more than 50 mu of garden land. (Huang Shu, Song Nian, Zhi Ming)
    ▲The Laiyuan County Party Committee called on all personnel from government agencies and schools to guarantee the survival of five trees each. (Chen Shan)
    ▲Wang Dashan from Nanqiu Village, Gaoyi County, introduced his tree-planting experience: first put a layer of soil from the main road at the bottom of the tree pit. This soil is strong and generates heat, so the trees grow quickly and sprout easily.
