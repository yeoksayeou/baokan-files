　　Nenni and Robeson Speeches
    Calling on People of All Countries to Unite to Defend Peace and Turn the Atlantic Aggression Pact into Waste Paper
    Italian representative Nenni delivered a speech at the conference, saying: This conference is a conference of people determined to defend peace and oppose warmongers by all means. The unity of the people of all countries is the best weapon to defend peace. In order to turn the North Atlantic Treaty into a piece of waste paper, peace-loving people of all countries must unite. Nenni finally suggested establishing an International Standing Council for Peace to unite the strength of the world and fight for peace in a united and unwavering manner.
    American representative, famous Black singer Robeson, on behalf of the democratic forces of the United States, especially the Black people of the United States and the people of colonial countries, extended warm greetings to the delegates of the conference. He said that our determination to fight for peace is firm and tenacious. We support peace and friendship with the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries. We want to fight against the new imperialist enslavement. Robeson reminded the conference that the Americas were built by the labor of people from Europe (especially Eastern Europe) and the labor of millions of Black people in the United States. He said that when he was in the Soviet Union in 1934, he felt for the first time in his life that he was a complete person. The progressive forces of the Americas do not want war, and the Black people living in the United States do not want war either. We will fight for peace, for friendship with the people of the great Soviet Union, for the victory of democracy, and for the liberation of colonial people from imperialist oppression.

　　南尼、罗伯逊演说
    呼吁各国人民团结保卫和平把大西洋侵略公约变成废纸
    意大利代表南尼在大会上发表讲演说：这个大会是决心以一切方法保卫和平、反对战争挑拨者的人们的大会。各国人民的团结是保卫和平的最好武器。为了使北大西洋公约成为一团废纸，爱好和平的各国人民必须联合起来。南尼最后建议建立一个国际和平常务理事会，团结全世界力量，联合一致，坚定不移地为和平而斗争。
    美国代表，著名黑人歌手罗伯逊代表美国民主力量，特别是美国的黑人以及殖民地国家人民，向大会代表致热烈的敬礼。他说，我们的为和平而斗争的决心是坚决顽强的。我们拥护和平和与苏联及人民民主国家的友谊。我们要向新帝国主义奴役作战。罗伯逊提醒大会说，美洲是由来自欧洲（特别是东欧）的人民劳动，以及美国数百万黑人的劳动建设起来的。他说，当他在一九三四年在苏联时，他才平生第一次地感觉到他是一个完全意义的人。美洲的进步力量不要战争，居住在美国的黑人也不要战争。我们将为和平，为与伟大苏联的人民的友谊，为民主的胜利和殖民地人民从帝国主义压迫下的解放而战斗。
