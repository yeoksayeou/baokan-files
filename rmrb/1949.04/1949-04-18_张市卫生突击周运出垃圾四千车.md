　　[Zhangjiakou News] Zhangjiakou City's sanitation blitz week achieved great results. The blitz week ran from the 17th to the 23rd of last month. Prior to the week, mobilization and arrangements were made at street cadre meetings. Each street established a sanitation committee. During the week-long blitz, the city cleared out over 4,000 large cartloads of garbage; garbage stations were also established, and designated garbage disposal areas were assigned. Each household's daily garbage was transported out by sanitation vehicles, laying a good foundation for future sanitation work. After the blitz week concluded, evaluations were conducted, with the Second District achieving the best results. All team members started work at six in the morning and continued until dark. They did not unharness the animals during lunchtime but fed them while harnessed, and they resumed work without rest after eating. Therefore, work efficiency was greatly improved. Usually, each large cart would transport seven or eight cartloads of garbage per day, but during the blitz week, they transported fourteen large cartloads daily. However, the city's sanitation work is still far from adequate with just this one blitz. During this time of epidemic prevalence, it is necessary to pay constant attention and greatly strengthen sanitation efforts. (Xing)

　　张市卫生突击周运出垃圾四千车
    【张垣讯】张家口市清洁卫生突击周获得很大成绩。突击周从上月十七日起至二十三日止，事先在街干部会议上作了动员和布置，各街成立了卫生委员会，在一周突击中，全市共清除垃圾四千余大车；并建立了垃圾站，指定了倒垃圾的地方，各户每日所除出的垃圾由卫生车运出，为以后的卫生工作打下了很好的基础。突击周完毕后，即进行评判，以二区成绩为最好。全体队员从早六点开始工作，直至天黑才收工，吃午饭时不卸牲口，套着喂，吃了饭不休息就工作，所以工作效率大大提高，平时每辆大车每日运出垃圾七、八车，在突击周中，每天运出十四大车。但张市清洁卫生工作，仅此一次突击，还很不够，值此瘟疫流行时期，还须经常注意大大加强。　　　　　　　　　　（兴）
