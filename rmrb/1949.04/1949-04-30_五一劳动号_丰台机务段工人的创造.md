　　May Day Labor Locomotive
    — A Creation of Workers at the Fengtai Locomotive Depot
    By our reporter, Xing Jun

    Eight hundred and eighty-five broken parts of locomotive No. 762 were dramatically transformed into a brand-new "May Day Labor Locomotive." This is a gift rushed out by the workers of the Fengtai Locomotive Depot machine shop, in order to commemorate their own holiday—May Day—with extraordinary labor and wisdom.
    When the news that actual actions would be taken to commemorate "May Day" spread to Fengtai, it swept through every corner like the wind, especially touching the hearts of the machine shop workers. "We've been talking about a competition for a long time, but nobody believed it! This is an opportunity!" People were discussing. On April 8th, the technology section convened a meeting of production team leaders and employee representatives to discuss how to prepare for "May Day." Strangely! They all unanimously advocated repairing a broken locomotive as a souvenir. Employee representative Su Yinyi said: "This is an extra task, and it cannot interfere with normal production. We'll do extra work, and we won't take overtime pay. That's our contribution!" Everyone agreed. On the spot, foundry worker Chen Youcai said: "We'll take on the lettering and casting!" Li Qi and Liu Shutian said: "We'll handle the copper work!" But this was only the opinion of a few people, and the above spirit needed to be brought to the teams for discussion. As it turned out, the workers who had been planning this for a long time were waiting for this matter; so they signed up to participate one after another. Then, according to the damage of the locomotive and everyone's skills, the work was specifically divided. The water pump and the side of the boiler were taken over by ten people in the "B and C Inspection" Group A; the driver's cab, steam dome, front wheel, springs, etc., were taken over by twenty-four people in Group B; the interior of the firebox was taken over by the boiler department of "A Inspection"; the air brake parts and the motor were taken over by the air brake team; the slip ring front and rear and the installation of lights were considered to be the job of painter Zhang Zhaofu; the complete set of turning work was taken over by the turning plate team… Exactly what "tricks" would the higher-ups play on this "May Day" also took a lot of effort to figure out. It was decided to officially start work on the 10th. In order to complete the task ahead of schedule, Guo Xigeng of the tool room, Bian Zhenping of the wind turbine room, Fu Guangshun of the boiler team, and others started working without eating after the meeting. From then on, every night, Sunday, and in the intervals of normal production, the machine shop workers could no longer be seen resting. Especially after receiving a letter from the Railway Bureau encouraging them, their enthusiasm was even higher. Some spent their own money to buy oilstones, brooms, and chalk to invest in this production increase campaign.
    On April 23rd, the reporter visited the worker production. The locomotive was covered with people, painting, oiling, lettering, removing rust, busy without end; no cotton thread, only linen, no sandpaper, only red bricks, worker Xu Lu, tightening one by one those slightly loose screws; Liu Liansheng's steady mis-knife, aimed at the rough shaft skin; four young office workers, also automatically participated in drawing smoke pipes; gas lamps swinging back and forth, carefully looking for where to repair; worker Zhang Jinghe vigorously holding the wind grinding wheel, squeaking, rubbing the wheel for many years rolling out the flying edge, sparks flying everywhere, scorching his smiling face, scorching his oily black clothes... the moving scene, I can not describe, only watching that "ashy thing," almost was eaten by them! I know that the most "difficult" work is in two places. One is that the crank axle is not round, and people were very worried at the time. Later, the old technician Li Shengyan invented a eccentric grinding machine, which conquered it. One is to replace the two back-hook air cylinders, because the turning bed is small, it is very difficult, and the turning plate team workers worked day and night, some for eight days and nights without rest, using two pieces of more than three hundred pounds of rough material to make new ones.
    When the reporter went there for the second time, the workers were laughing around the resurrected locomotive. The black boiler was inlaid with strips of raised gold hoops, with broken flowers on top; on the crescent plates on both sides, there were iron statues of workers and peasants, which could make plowing and hammering gestures as the wheels turned, which they called "Worker-Peasant Unity." The upper iron plate of the wind window is inlaid with mercury-containing glass, which can overlook the situation of the rear train, and can be vigilant in time for accidents, which is rarely seen in the front of locomotives. In the center is a huge statue of Chairman Mao, and the outer semicircle is written with "Forever Forward under the Leadership of the People's Leader Chairman Mao"; Below are the words "Labor Creates the World, Workers' Hands are All-Powerful," etc. Some workers commented: "The next one looks better in the top position!" Some said: "There would be no workers without the Communist Party!" (Meaning that there would be no liberation of workers without the leadership of the Communist Party) "It's more reasonable to have Chairman Mao on top" At this time, Military Control Representative Comrade Xi told me incidentally: "This is the half-month effort, all 180 workers in the factory, squeezing out 5,000 work hours day and night without taking overtime pay to complete it: the value of the 'May Day Labor Locomotive' is mainly here"!

　　五一劳动号
    ——丰台机务段工人的创造
    本报记者  邢军
    破损八百八十五件七六二机车，剧然变成一台崭新的“五一劳动号”了。这是丰台机务段机厂工友，为了纪念自己的节日——五一劳动节——以超常的劳动姿态和智慧赶制的礼物。
    当以实际行动纪念“五一”的消息传到了丰台，就象风也似的吹遍了每个角落，特别打动了机厂工友们的心。“早就说竞赛也没信啦！这可是个机会！”人们都在舆论着。四月八日，技术股召集生产小组长和职工代表开会，商量怎么准备过“五一”。怪得很！不约而同的都主张修好个破机车留作纪念。职工代表苏银意说：“这算个额外的任务，不能妨碍正常生产，各外加工，不领加班费，才算是咱们的供献！”大家同意。当场翻砂工陈有才说：“镶字、翻砂我们担任！”李岐和刘书田说：“铜活我们揽！”但这总算是少数人的意见，还需要将上述精神带到小组里讨论。那知道蓄意已久的工友正在盼着这回事；于是纷纷报名参加。随即根据机车破损情况，和每个人的技术，具体分工。水泵和靠锅瓦路，由“乙丙检”甲组十个人担任，车上司机室、汽包、先旋轮、弹簧等，由乙组二十四人担任；火室内部由“甲检”锅炉部担任；风闸各部和电机，由风闸组负责；滑环前后和装灯，油漆匠张兆富自认是他们的活；全套旋活由旋盘组负责……究竟这个“五一劳动节”，上面搞些什么“明堂”，大家又费了一番心血。并决定从十号正式开工。为了提前完成任务，工具室的郭锡庚，风车室的边振平，锅炉组的傅广顺等，散会没有吃饭，便开始了工作。从此，每天晚上、星期日、正常生产的空隙里，就再也看不着机厂工友们休息。尤其接到路局鼓励他们的信之后，情绪更高。有的自己花钱买油石，买条帚，买粉笔，投入这一增产运动。
    四月二十三日，记者参观了工人生产。机车上爬满了人，刷漆的、给油的、镶字的、擦锈的，忙个不了，没有绵丝用线麻，没有砂布用红砖，工人徐禄，一个一个的拧紧那稍微松些的螺丝；刘连生稳重的错刀，对准粗糙的轴皮；四个室内青年职员，也自动参加抽烟管；瓦斯灯晃来晃去，仔细寻找那处需要重修；工人张景和用力持着风砂轮，吱吱作响，磨擦着车轮多年碾出的飞边，火花四处飞舞，燎过他含笑的脸，燎去他油黑的衣服……动人的场面，我不好形容，只看着那个“灰大的东西”，几乎被他们吃喽！我知道其中最“鳌手”的活有两处。一是曲拐轴不圆，当时人们很发愁，后来老技工李圣言，发明一架偏磨旋正机，才征服了它。一是换两个气筒勾背，因为旋床小，很吃力，由旋盘组工人四昼夜，有的八昼夜没有休息，用两块三百多斤重的荒料，制成了新的。
    当记者二次去那里，工友们正在围着复活的机车发笑。漆黑的锅炉，镶着一条一条突起的金箍，上面还有碎花；两边的月牙板上，装置有工人和农夫的铁像，可随着车轮的转动，作出刨地，打锤的姿势，他们称之“工农团结”。风窗上部的护铁板，镶上带水银的玻璃，可以了望后部列车的情况，及时可以警惕发生事故，这是从来机车所少见的车头，中央是毛主席巨像，外围半圆弧上写着在人民领袖毛主席领导下永远前进；下面还有劳动创造世界，工人双手万能等等字样。有的工人评论：“下条放在上面的位置好看！”有的说：“没有共产党就没有工人”！（意思是说没有共产党领导就没有工人的解放）“还是毛主席在上面合理”此时军管代表奚同志顺便告诉我：“这是半月工夫，全厂一百八十名工友，日夜挤出五千个工时不领加班费所完成的：‘五一劳动号’的价值也主要在这哩”！
