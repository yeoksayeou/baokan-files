    Mayakovsky – This great Soviet revolutionary poet was born in 1893 in the village of Baghdadi, Georgia, and died in 1930. In 1908, he joined the Russian Social Democratic Labour Party and was imprisoned for participating in the publication of secret Bolshevik newspapers. He began his literary career by creating many new forms of poetry full of fighting significance. After the October Revolution, he became an outstanding proletarian cultural fighter. In 1919, he worked at the "Russian Telegraph Agency." He wrote scripts, wrote poetry, and drew propaganda cartoons with poetic captions. His most successful works were articles exposing the essence of American society and the poem "Vladimir Ilyich Lenin," which praised the leader of the proletarian revolution. Stalin once said, "Mayakovsky was, is, and will always be the best and most talented poet produced by our Soviet generation."

    马耶可夫斯基——这位伟大的苏联革命诗人于一八九三年生于乔治亚的瓦格达迪村，死于一九九三○年。一九○八年加入俄国社会民主工党，因为参与布尔塞维克的秘密报纸出版工作，曾被拘入监狱。他开始他的文学生涯时，就创造了许多富于战斗意义的诗的新形式。十月革命以后，他成为无产阶级的优秀文化战士，一九一九年在“俄国电讯社”工作，他写剧本、写诗歌、还画着附有诗句的宣传卡通片。他最成功的著作是揭露美国社会本质的文章和歌颂无产阶级革命领袖的“乌拉基米尔·伊里奇·列宁”这首诗。斯大林曾说：“马耶可夫斯基过去是、现在也是我们苏维埃一代产生的最优秀和最天才的诗人”。
