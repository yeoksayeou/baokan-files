　　Strengthen the Learning of Economic Cadres
　　Many of our comrades engaged in economic work have accumulated rich experience, but lack systematic organization and summarization; some comrades, because they have not been involved in economic work for long, lack knowledge, especially after entering the cities, they are not familiar with many complex issues in urban economic work for a while, they are not good at managing factories and enterprises, and they are not good at fighting against speculative merchants... This has caused a lot of losses in work. At present, economic work has been raised to an unprecedentedly important position. If we do not gradually improve our knowledge and ability, we will not be able to shoulder the great task of construction. To this end, Taihang has gathered more than 400 economic work cadres to study, and all regions should pay attention to this matter. According to the learning experience of various places, in addition to learning from Soviet experience (such as Volume 16 of the Selected Works of Lenin), more generally, we must study Chairman Mao's instructions on financial and economic work and the Party's various economic policies, combining them with the actual conditions of the local area, so that theory and practice are combined.
    Compile Popular Readings for Workers
    In order to strengthen the education of workers and improve their political consciousness, workers' night schools and short-term training classes for workers have gradually increased in various places, and they have begun to pay attention to organizing workers' daily study. In this way, the issue of providing workers with reading materials, especially popular reading materials, has been raised. Our authors and publishers should take on this responsibility. At present, we should first compile some such teaching materials: such as historical materialism, basic issues of the Chinese revolution, and explanations of current policies – workers have openly made this request, and we should do our best to do so.

　　三言两语 　 加强经济干部学习
    我们作经济工作的同志，许多人已累积了丰富的经验，但缺乏系统的整理与总结；其中一部分同志则因参加经济工作不久，知识贫乏，尤其是进了城市，对城市经济工作中许多复杂问题，一时仍不摸门，不会把工厂企业管理的好，不善于同投机商人等进行斗争…………致使工作吃了很多亏。目前，经济工作被提到空前重要的地位，如果不逐步提高我们的知识能力，便无从负起伟大的建设任务。为此，太行集合四百多经济工作干部进行学习，各地都应注意这件事。根据各地学习经验，除学习苏联经验（如列宁选集十六卷）外，更普遍的，要学习毛主席关于财经工作的指示，和党的各种经济政策，结合当地实际情况，使理论与实际结合起来。
    编印工人通俗读物
    为了加强对工人的教育，提高他们的政治觉悟，各地工人夜校，工人短期训练班，已逐渐增多，并开始注意组织工人日常学习。这样，供给工人的读物特别是通俗读物的问题，就被提出来了。我们的作者、出版界应负起这个责任。目前首应编些这样的教材：如唯物史观，中国革命基本问题，及对当前各种政策的解释的，——工人已公开提出这个要求，我们应尽力照办。
