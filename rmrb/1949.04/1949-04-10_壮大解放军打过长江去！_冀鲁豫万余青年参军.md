　　Strengthen the PLA and cross the Yangtze River!
  　More than 10,000 youths from Hebei, Shandong, and Henan join the army
    [Hebei, Shandong, and Henan Electric Dispatch] In order to carry the revolution through to the end, the people of Hebei, Shandong, and Henan have successively sent more than 14,000 outstanding young adults to join the People's Liberation Army. At the same time, 1,600 demobilized soldiers have returned to their units. Before and during the conscription campaign, the entire region conducted extensive and in-depth propaganda and education on carrying the revolution through to the end. Party committees and cadres at all levels also explicitly and resolutely implemented the conscription policy of "political mobilization, voluntary participation, and fairness and reasonableness" in their mobilization work. They also implemented the mass line of leadership from within the Party to outside the Party. As a result, a surge of outstanding young adults joining the army has been formed in most areas. Moving stories of vying to join the army are especially common. Ku Shengtang, an old Communist Party member in his sixties from Weihukou Hancun Village, competed with his two sons to join the army after hearing the Party's call for conscription. However, some other areas showed the following tendencies at the beginning of the conscription: namely, cadres did not fully understand the masses' enthusiasm for revenge after two and a half years of burning, killing, and looting by the Chiang bandits in northern Henan, and they underestimated the masses' level of awareness, showing right-leaning tendencies. At the same time, individual areas also experienced blind optimism, believing that "the numbers are not large, and it will be easy to complete the task," and therefore resorted to coercion when encountering difficulties. Again, before the start of conscription, the district Party committee had clearly stipulated that conscription and return to the team should be carried out simultaneously, and the return work should be started first. However, in the implementation of this policy, all localities generally neglected the work of returning to the team.

　　壮大解放军打过长江去！
  　冀鲁豫万余青年参军
    【冀鲁豫电】冀鲁豫人民为将革命进行到底，一万四千余优秀青壮年先后参加解放军。同时，并有一千六百名离队战士归队。在参军运动开始以前及参军运动当中，全区进行了广泛深入的将革命进行到底的宣传教育，各级党委及干部在动员参军工作中也都明确坚决地执行了“政治动员，自觉自愿及公平合理”的兵役政策，并贯彻了由党内到党外，有领导的群众路线。因而大部地区形成了大批优秀青壮年参军的热潮。争着参军的动人事迹，尤属普遍，卫河库韩村六十多岁的老共产党员库升堂，听到党的参军号召后，和他的两个儿子争着参军。但另外一部分地区在参军开始时产生了下述偏向：即干部对豫北群众经过蒋匪两年半的烧杀抢掠的复仇热情认识不够，对群众的觉悟程度估计过低，表现了右倾；同时，也有个别地区产生了盲目乐观的现象，认为“数字不大，很好完成”，因而在遇到些困难就发生了强迫命令。再次，参军开始前，区党委即曾明确规定：参军与归队同时进行，并应从归队入手。但各地在执行这一方针中则较普遍地发生了忽视归队工作的偏向。
