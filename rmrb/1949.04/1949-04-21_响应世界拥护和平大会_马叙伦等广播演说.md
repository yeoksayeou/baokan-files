　　Ma Xulun
Ma Xulun, Standing Director of the China Association for Promoting Democracy, Broadcast Speech Protesting the French Government's Restrictions on the Entry of Peace Representatives from Various Countries

This is the century of the people! The democratic forces of the whole world have surpassed the reactionary forces of imperialism! All peace-loving countries, all nations opposed to imperialism, and all the people who demand democracy, freedom, and happiness have united! The democratic forces of the whole world will never allow the reactionary group headed by US imperialism to provoke a new war, will never allow imperialism to use the peace-loving people of various countries as cannon fodder, and will never allow parasites of mankind to destroy the world for their own profits!

In order to endanger the peace and security of mankind, US imperialism, in violation of the will of the people of all countries, threatened and lured the reactionary governments of its vassal states to sign the North Atlantic Treaty for launching aggression. This reactionary treaty has aroused the roar of the people of the world! The shameless imperialists still want to deceive the world by calling the treaty of aggression "defensive." It has now been proven that what the warmongers are defending is not war, but the peace of the whole world. US imperialism and its lackeys are trembling in front of the world's 600 million organized fighters. The reactionary government of France, under the instructions of its master, has unreasonably restricted the entry of peace representatives, obstructing the peace representatives of 600 million people. This is proof of opposing peace and provoking war. The unparalleled power of the world's people to uphold peace cannot be stopped. Restricting the entry of representatives only proves that US imperialism is a paper tiger, exposing the complete incompetence and stupidity of the reactionary group!

If the reactionary French government does not immediately cancel this unreasonable and stupid behavior, it will surely be spurned by the people of the world and by the French people themselves. The various democratic parties of China and the masses of the Chinese people have expressed their firm will to unite with the democratic forces of the world, led by the Soviet Union. In order to save mankind from disaster, the giant hand of the world's people will surely tear off the bloody hands of the executioners. Whoever is determined to violate the people, whoever is determined to follow the ghosts of Mussolini and Hitler, will be pushed by the masses of the people of the world into the grave he has dug himself!

　　Tan Pingshan
Mr. Tan Pingshan, Standing Committee Member of the San Min Chu I Comrades Association of the Chinese Kuomintang, Broadcast Speech Protesting the French Government's Restrictions on the Entry of Peace Representatives

People all over the world who love peace:

We feel very surprised and indignant to hear that the French government has openly and unreasonably restricted the number of representatives from various countries to attend the World Peace Congress in Paris; on behalf of all members of the San Min Chu I Comrades Association of the Chinese Kuomintang, I express serious protest against the French government's audacious behavior of being an enemy of the peace-loving people of the world! We believe that France's action is completely contrary to the will of the French people. The French government is willing to be a running dog of US imperialism. In fact, it is implementing the reactionary policy of US imperialism to create war and destroy peace. This is a great loss to the dignity of the French people's independence and autonomy. Therefore, we know that peace-loving people all over the world will definitely protest resolutely to the French government until France cancels this restriction.

Since the signing of the North Atlantic Treaty, international warmongers led by US imperialism have been clamoring for war every day, deliberately creating a war atmosphere. This is all a conspiracy by US imperialist financial oligarchs, arms dealers, and ambitious warlords to seek private gain from the war. They want to make big speculative deals in the war. They are determined to destroy world peace and move towards the road of war. However, on the other hand, we must recognize that no one in the world is against war. We firmly believe that the power of the peace-loving people of the world can overcome the war crisis. At the same time, we also firmly believe that even if the imperialists launch a war in defiance of world opinion, then the imperialists will inevitably accelerate their collapse and demise.

We Chinese people must stand closely together with the peace-loving people of the world, resolutely oppose war, uphold peace, and fight to the end against all international reactionaries and imperialists! Now the World Peace Congress in Paris is about to open. We hope that all peace-loving people in the world will unanimously and resolutely protest against the French reactionary government's behavior of undermining world peace! We celebrate the successful success of the World Peace Congress! We respectfully wish the representatives attending the World Peace Congress good health!

　　Huang Yanpei
Mr. Huang Yanpei, Standing Director of the China National Democratic Construction Association, Condemns the French Government for Restricting the Entry of Peace Representatives from Various Countries

The World Peace Congress in Paris opens today. People from various countries who are enthusiastic about upholding peace have sent their trusted representatives, batch after batch, traveling hundreds, thousands, or even tens of thousands of miles, looking forward to going to Paris, the capital of France, to attend the meeting. Suddenly, the French government issued an order that each country sending representatives to the Peace Congress is only allowed to have eight attendees, that is, only eight people are allowed to enter French territory. On top of fiery emotions, a bucket of cold water was suddenly poured. I really don't understand what this means?

The initiation of this Peace Congress has indeed won the sympathy of the people all over the world, except for a very few warmongers, so it has naturally aroused many countries. As far as I know at the time of the broadcast, a total of 53 countries have sent approximately 2,000 representatives, which proves that peace is the most popular noun in the dictionary of the people. We China are in the early stages of the people's revolution, and most of China has been liberated. This delegation does not represent the government, but represents the vast majority of the people of China. I believe that this entire group of 2,000 representatives sent from many countries in all directions represents their people. It can almost be said that they represent the vast majority of the people on the entire earth, except for a very few warmongers. What impression will this action of the French government give to the minds of the vast majority of people on the entire earth, when it may leave three-quarters or even four-fifths of the 2,000 representatives locked outside the French gate?

I dare say that this action of the French government is simply a great violation of the psychology of the French people. The French people were the first to shout out freedom, equality, and fraternity, and wrote a glorious history of the Great Revolution during the time of Louis XVI. Peace and freedom, equality, and fraternity are not two separate things, but have inseparable meaning. This World Peace Congress, held in Paris, is obviously a reward for the merits of the French ancestors who wrote this glorious history. Unexpectedly, the French government would put on such a stupid act. I don't know what method they will use to appease the indignation of the French people who love freedom, equality, fraternity, and peace.

There is the North Atlantic Treaty that provokes aggressive war, and then there is the World Peace Congress that stops this conspiracy. The French government wants to weaken the strength of the conference and reduce the strong reaction of the world by limiting the number of representatives attending. This action, I am afraid, will only increase the anger of countries around the world and instead arouse a stronger reaction from peace-loving people. We must recognize that this shows the behind-the-scenes planning of the imperialist conspirators. We believe that peace is the common demand of all mankind, and we will never allow imperialists to oppress democratic countries with war. Even if such a thing happens, the imperialists will always fail, because their enemies are not only on the other side, but also in their own homes. The people in their homes all love peace and demand peace, even at the cost of being enemies with them. Let's all watch! Watch the final outcome of the imperialists!

　　Liu Yazi
Mr. Liu Yazi, Chairman of the Central Supervisory Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, Broadcast Speech

The current French government is reactionary, treasonous, anti-people, and a running dog of the gold dollar empire. It cannot represent the interests of the workers and peasants of France. Therefore, it has created various difficulties and obstacles for the convening of this World Peace Congress in Paris, restricting the number of representatives from various countries, arousing the public anger of the people of the world.

The convocation of this World Peace Congress is a struggle between peace and war. On the one hand, there is the great alliance of the Soviet Union, the fortress of peace in the world, and the new democratic countries of Southeast Europe, as well as our People's Republic of China. On the other hand, there is the gold dollar empire of the United States and other lackeys of various forms. May I ask: Which nation is against peace? Which nation likes war? Therefore, those who truly welcome war are only the financial giants of Wall Street and their vassals. The rest of the people of the world, as well as the people of the entire United States, welcome peace and oppose war.

In addition, this time the gold dollar empire's provocation of war has its conspiracy: this conspiracy is to provoke war to prosper arms merchants and other kinds of trade, in order to save their impending economic collapse. Another conspiracy is to expand its colonial policy in the name of anti-Soviet and anti-communist, taking the old colonies of Britain, France, and the Netherlands as its own. However, capitalism in the world has reached the final stage of decline, and its dreams will never come true.

When we look back at history, the result of the First World War was the overthrow of the tsarist dynasty in Russia, the creation of the emerging Soviet Union, and the complete transformation of one-sixth of mankind in the world.

The result of the Second World War was the elimination of the most reactionary and barbaric three beasts, Germany, Japan, and Italy, the strengthening of the Soviet Union's power, the lifting of the heads of the new democratic countries of Southeast Europe, the complete victory of the Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and the collapse of the reactionary rule of the traitor Chiang Kai-shek. Therefore, if the dream of the gold dollar empire to provoke war is realized, the result must be the final demise of capitalist imperialism throughout the world. However, the people of the world do not want war, and the people of the entire United States do not want war either. Therefore, the good dreams of the financial giants of Wall Street are bound to be shattered.

Chairman Mao said well: "US imperialism is a paper tiger, don't be afraid of it." We must expose this paper tiger, tear off its hideous face, smash its paper claws, and shatter it to pieces so that it can no longer frighten people. We must adhere to peace, destroy war, eliminate warmongers, and expose the masks of the French reactionary and traitorous government. This is the responsibility of the people all over the world, and the United States is no exception. Of course, it is also the responsibility of all the Chinese people. We want to protest to the reactionaries of the world. We want to shout to the people of the world:

Long live the World Peace Congress!
Long live the true peace of all China!
Long live the liberation of all the Chinese people!

　　响应世界拥护和平大会
  　马叙伦等广播演说
    新华社编者按：中国民主促进会常务理事马叙伦先生，中国国民党三民主义同志联合会常务委员谭平山先生，民主建国会常务理事黄炎培先生，中国国民党革命委员会中央监察委员会主席柳亚子先生等各民主党派、人民团体代表，昨续假北平新华广播电台发表广播演说，响应正在巴黎举行之世界拥护和平大会并声援出席该会之中国代表团。兹志其原词如下：
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
　　马叙伦
    中国民主促进会常务理事马叙伦为抗议法国政府限制各国和平代表入境广播词
    这是人民的世纪，全世界民主的力量已经超过了帝国主义反动的力量！一切爱好和平的国家，一切反对帝国主义的民族，一切要求民主、自由、幸福的人民大众已经团结一致地起来了！全世界民主的力量决不允许以美帝国主义为首的反动集团来挑拨新的战争，决不允许帝国主义把各国爱好和平的人民去充当炮灰，决不允许人类的寄生虫为了自己的利润来毁灭世界！
    美帝国主义为了危害人类的和平与安全，违反了各国人民的意志，威胁利诱地逼着它的附庸国的反动政府签定了发动侵略的北大西洋公约。这个反动的公约已经激起了全世界人民的怒吼！无耻的帝国主义还想欺骗世界把侵略行为的公约称为“防御性”的。现在已经证明：战争贩子们所防御的不是战争，而是全世界的和平。美帝国主义及其走狗们在世界六万万有组织的战士们面前发抖。法国的反动政府在它的主子的指使下，毫无理由地限制和平代表入境，阻挠六万万人的和平代表。这就是反对和平、挑拨战争的证据。全世界人民拥护和平的无比的力量是阻止不了的。限制代表入境只证明美帝国主义是个纸老虎，暴露了反动集团的十足的无能与愚蠢！
    反动的法国政府如果不立即取消这一无理的愚蠢的行为，一定会被全世界人民所唾弃，一定会被法国自己的人民所唾弃。中国各民主党派，中国的人民大众已经表示了坚强的意志，一定和以苏联为首的全世界民主的力量结合在一起。为了挽救人类的灾难，全世界人民的巨手必定把刽子手们的血手掏断。谁决心违反人民，谁决心跟着墨索里尼、希特勒的阴魂走的，谁就会被全世界的人民大众推到他自己所掘的坟墓里去！
　　谭平山
    中国国民党三民主义同志联合会常务委员谭平山先生为抗议法国政府限制和平代表入境广播词
    全世界爱好和平的人们：
    我们听说法国政府公然无理地限制各国派赴巴黎出席世界拥护和平大会的代表人数，感觉非常惊异和愤慨；我代表中国国民党三民主义同志联合会的全体会员对于法国政府这种与全世界爱好和平人民为敌的胆大行为表示严重的抗议！我们认为法国这一行动完全是违背法国人民意志的，法国政府甘愿为美帝国主义的走狗，实际上是执行了美帝国主义制造战争破坏和平的反动政策，这对于法国人民独立自主的尊严是极大的损失。因此，我们知道全世界爱好和平的人民，必定向法国政府坚决抗议，一直到法国取消这种限制为止。
    自从北大西洋公约签订以后，以美帝国主义为首的国际战争贩子天天在叫嚣战争，故意的制造战争空气。这都是美帝的金融寡头，军火商以及野心军阀等企图从战争中获取私利的阴谋，他们想在战争中做大笔投机买卖。他们是存心要破坏世界和平走向战争道路的。可是，另方面，我们必须认清：全世界的人民无人不是反对战争。我们坚信全世界爱好和平的人民力量可以克服战争危机的。同时，我们也坚信：即使帝国主义者冒天下之大不韪发动战争，那么，帝国主义者也必然加速的崩溃，灭亡。
    我们中国人民一定与世界爱好和平的人们紧密的站在一起，坚决的反对战争，拥护和平，并且与一切的国际反动派帝国主义者斗争到底！现在巴黎世界拥护和平大会即将开幕了，希望我们全世界爱好和平的人民一致坚决抗议法国反动政府这种破坏世界和平的行为！我们庆祝世界拥护和平大会胜利的成功！我们敬祝出席世界拥护和平大会的代表们的健康！
　　黄炎培
    民主建国会常务理事黄炎培先生斥责法国政府限制各国拥护和平代表入境广播词
    巴黎世界拥护和平大会今天开幕，热心拥护和平各国的人民派出了他们所信任的代表，一批一批经过了几百几千里甚至几万里的辽远路程，望着法国京城巴黎去赴会。忽然法国政府发出一道命令，各国派赴和平大会的代表每国只准许八名出席，就是只准许八名进法国国境。在火剌剌的情绪上边，突然浇下一桶冷水，我真不了解是什么意思？
    这次拥护和平大会的发起，的确获得全世界人民的同情，只有极少数好战分子除外，所以很自然的激动了许多国家。据我在广播时所知道，已有五十三个国一共派出了大约二千名的代表，这就证明了和平是在人民字典里最博得大众欢迎的一个名词。我们中华正在人民革命胜利的初期，已经解放了大半个中国，这一个代表团，不是代表了政府，而是代表了全中华绝大多数的人民，我相信这整个大群从四方八面许多国家派遣出来的二千名代表，都是代表他们的人民，几乎可以说：他们代表了全地球绝大多数的人民，只有极少数好战分子除外。法国政府这一举动，可能使二千名代表中间，将有四分之三甚至五分之四以上被关在法国国门以外，请问给予全地球绝大多数人民的心理上什么印象呢？
    法国政府这一举动，我敢断言，简直大大违反了法国人民的心理。法国人民最早喊出自由、平等、博爱，在路易十六时，写出一篇大革命的光荣历史。和平和自由平等博爱，不是两件东西，中间具有不可分的意义。这次世界拥护和平大会，开在巴黎，显然是酬答法国先民写出这篇光荣历史的勋绩。料不到法国政府会演出这种愚蠢的把戏。不晓得他们将用什么方法，来平法国爱好自由平等博爱即爱好和平人民的愤慨。
    有挑动侵略战争的北大西洋公约，才有制止这种阴谋的世界拥护和平大会。法国政府想用限制代表出席人数，来削弱大会力量减少世界强有力的反应。这一举动，怕只有增加世界各国的愤怒，反而激起爱好和平者更强有力的反应。我们要认定从这一点上显出帝国主义阴谋家在幕后的策动。我们相信和平是全人类公共的要求，决不让帝国主义者用战争来压迫民主国家。就使演出这种事情，结果帝国主义者总是失败，因为他们的敌人不单在对方，而还在他们的家里，他们家里的人民，就都在爱好和平，要求和平不惜和他们为敌的缘故。我们大家看罢！看帝国主义者最后的结局罢！
　　柳亚子
    中国国民党革命委员会中央监察委员会主席柳亚子先生广播词
    现在的法国政府是反动的，卖国的，反人民的，是金元帝国的走狗。它不能代表法国的工农大众的利益的。因此，它对于这次世界拥护和平大会在巴黎的召开，加以种种留难刁顿，限制各国代表人数，引起世界人民的公愤。
    这次世界拥护和平大会的召集，是和平和战争的斗争。一方面是全世界和平堡垒的苏联，和东南欧新民主主义国家以及我们的中华民主人民共和国的大联合。一方面是金元帝国的美国以及其他形形式式的奴才们。试问：那一个民族是反对和平的？那一个民族是欢喜战争的？所以，真真欢迎战争的，只有华尔街的金融巨头以及他们的附庸者，其余全世界的人民以及全美国的人民都是欢迎和平，反对战争的。
    另外，金元帝国这一次的挑起战争是有它的阴谋作用的：这一种阴谋，它想挑起战争繁荣军火商人以及其他种种贸易，以挽救他们行将到来的经济大崩溃，另一种阴谋，它借反苏、反共的名义来扩充自己的殖民政策，把原来英、法、荷兰的旧殖民地都收为己有。但，世界上资本主义已到了最后没落的阶段，它的幻梦是决不会实现的。
    我们翻开历史来看，第一次世界大战的结果，是推翻了沙俄的皇朝，是造成了新兴的苏联，使世界上六分之一的人类都翻了个大身。
    第二次世界大战的结果，是消灭了世界上最反动、最野蛮的德、日、意三只野兽，是加强了苏联的力量，使东南欧新民主主义国家都抬起了头，使我们中国人民和中国人民解放军得到了完全的胜利，使卖国贼蒋逆中正的反动统治归于崩溃。所以，万一金元帝国挑起战争的梦想实现，其结果一定是全世界资本帝国主义最后的灭亡。但，全世界人民不要战争，全美国人民也不要战争。所以华尔街金融巨头的好梦，是一定要幻灭的。
    毛主席讲得好：“美帝国主义者是一只纸老虎，不要怕它”。我们一定要拆穿这只纸老虎，撕下它狰狞的面目，粉碎它纸糊的爪牙，使它粉身碎骨，再也不能唬吓人们。我们一定要坚持和平，破坏战争，消灭战争贩子，揭破法国反动卖国政府的假面具，这是全世界人民的责任，连美国也不能例外。当然也就是我们全中国人民的责任。我们要向全世界的反动者提出抗议。我们要向全世界人民大声疾呼：
    全世界拥护和平大会万岁！
    全中国的真和平万岁！
    全中国人民解放万岁！
