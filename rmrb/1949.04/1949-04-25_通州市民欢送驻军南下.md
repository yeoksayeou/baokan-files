　　Tongzhou Citizens Cheerfully Send Off Garrison Troops Heading South
    [Ping City News] The garrison troops stationed in Tongzhou City have received orders to head south. Over 20,000 students and citizens held a grand rally to see off the army on its southern expedition. At the rally, the citizens unanimously cheered, demanding the liberation of the 200 million people in the Jiangnan region, the capture of Chiang Kai-shek alive, wishing the People's Liberation Army to water their horses in the Yue River, and extending a victorious salute to the People's Liberation Army. A representative of the People's Liberation Army said in a speech: Thank you for your condolences. Your hopes are our determination. After we leave, we will cause you elders a lot of trouble. We will have to trouble you to take care of our children in the future. The cordial language made the common people feel as if their own brothers and sisters were going on a long journey. Subsequently, hundreds of banners were presented to the rostrum amidst cheers.
