　　[Jizhong Telegram] The Pinghan Railway from Baoding north to Caoheqiao has been repaired, and a test run was successfully completed yesterday. All 274 employees of the Baoding Railway Management Committee completed this project in fourteen days. According to Comrade Zhou Shifan of the Road Construction Office, it used to take the Kuomintang at least one or two months to build the Caoheqiao bridge; now it is different. Only thirty-odd people can build a pontoon bridge in one day, and it is more solid than before. The road construction workers have begun to demonstrate their sense of ownership in their work. They searched everywhere for materials, finding 1,384 rails from the ground, from the river, and from the stone piles of the roadbed.

　　平汉路保漕段修复
    【冀中电】平汉铁路从保定往北到漕河桥已修好，并于昨日试车成功。保定市铁路管理委员会全体职工二百七十四人，十四天即筑起这段工程。据筑路处周士藩同志说：从前国民党修漕河桥，至少得用一两个月；现在则不然，三十几个人，一天就把浮桥架好了，而且比从前结实。修路工人，在工作中开始表现了主人翁姿态。他们到处搜集器材，从地下从河里，从路基的石头堆内，找出了一千三百八十四根铁轨。
