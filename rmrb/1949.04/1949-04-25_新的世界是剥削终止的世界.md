　　The New World is a World Where Exploitation Ends
    Sadoveanu
    Head of the Romanian delegation, Sadoveanu, then spoke. He exclaimed: Peace-loving people of the world, unite! The new world is a world of peace, a world of equality, and a world where exploitation ends. For the big capitalists, war is a profitable business. However, they are opposed by the people's immutable will for peace. They also encountered the opposition of the warriors defending peace—the Soviet Union and all of suffering humanity. The entire Romanian people have risen up to fight for peace.
    Major For, who was separated from his unit while fighting in the Spanish International Brigades, delivered a moving speech. He condemned the imperialists' policy of helping Franco and turning Spain into a fortress of the "Holy Alliance." He called on the assembly to fight against reaction and against fascism, and welcomed the "Great Greek dawn that the assembly brings to the people of the world!"
    Danish representative Hai Bo emphasized the dangers threatening the Danish people because the Social Democratic government, supported by reactionaries, included Denmark in the North Atlantic Treaty, abandoning its traditional policy of neutrality. A wave of protests against this war treaty has swept across Denmark. People from all walks of life, led by the working class, have participated in the Danish peace movement.
    Vietnamese women's representative Da Li Liang (transliteration) reported to the assembly on the Vietnamese people's struggle for national independence against French colonial imperialism and its American masters. She said that the Vietnamese people oppose the Marshall Plan and the North Atlantic Treaty.
    The young French disabled veterans representative spoke after the Vietnamese representative. He said that the French people are unwilling to be accomplices of warmongers. The French representatives declared before the World Congress of Supporters of Peace that they are determined to cleanse the shame that the French government has brought upon our motherland. The chairman of the assembly, Fadeev, announced before the end of the meeting that the Korean delegation had arrived to participate in the assembly. The whole audience applauded to welcome them. The assembly then read out the work reports of the delegates to the Prague Peace Congress.

　　新的世界是剥削终止的世界
    萨多维亚努
    罗马尼亚代表团团长萨多维亚努接着发言。他高呼：全世界和平拥护者联合起来，新的世界是和平的世界，是平等的世界和剥削终止的世界。对于大资本家说来，战争是有利的事业。但是，他们为人民的不可更易的和平意志所反对。他们也碰到了维护和平的战士——苏联和整个受过苦难的人类的反对。整个罗马尼亚人民都已经起来为和平而奋斗。
    在西班牙国际纵队中作战时失散的福尔少校发表了动人的演说。他斥责帝国主义者所奉行的帮助佛郎哥和把西班牙变成“神圣同盟”的城堡的政策。他号召大会为反对反动、反对法西斯主义而战，并欢迎“大会带给全世界人民以伟大希腊的黎明！”
    丹麦代表海柏着重指出威协着丹麦人民的危险，因为反动派支持下的社会民主党政府把丹麦包括入北大西洋公约，摒弃了传统的中立政策。抗议这个战争公约的浪潮已经横扫了丹麦全国。以工人阶级为首的一切阶层人民都参加了丹麦的和平运动。
    越南妇女代表达理梁（译音）向大会报告了越南人民为争取国家独立、反对法国殖民帝国主义者及其美国主子而进行的斗争，她说，越南人民反对马歇尔计划和北大西洋公约。
    年青的法国残废军人代表继越南代表之后演说。他说，法国人民不愿意做战争贩子的共谋者。法国代表在世界拥护和平大会之前宣布，他们决心涤雪法国政府使我们祖国蒙受的耻辱。大会主席法捷夫在会议结束前宣布：朝鲜代表团已经到来参加大会。全场鼓掌欢迎。大会随后宣读了关于布拉格和平大会代表们的工作报告。
