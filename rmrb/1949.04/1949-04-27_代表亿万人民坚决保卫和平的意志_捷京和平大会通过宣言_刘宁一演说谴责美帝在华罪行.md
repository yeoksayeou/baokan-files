Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 26th: Prague dispatch: The Prague Peace Congress passed a declaration on the afternoon of the 25th. The declaration stated:

	We, representatives of the people from 72 countries around the world, we, men and women belonging to all cultures, all ideologies, and all skin colors, have suffered terrible dangers, and this danger – the danger of war – is once again threatening the world.

	Four years after the end of the last great world tragedy, the people are being plunged into the danger of an arms race. The role of science, which was originally intended to guarantee human happiness, is now being diverted from its goal by some, forcing it to serve the purposes of war.

	Wars are already being waged in Vietnam, Indonesia, Malaya, and Greece.

	Gathered at this great World Peace Congress, we declare: we retain free minds, and propaganda cannot influence our judgment. We know who has undermined the agreements concluded between the major powers, agreements that proclaimed the possibility of coexistence of different social systems. We know who is undermining the United Nations Charter today.

	We know who considers treaties aimed at maintaining peace between nations merely scraps of paper, who rejects proposals for negotiations and disarmament, and who is arming to the teeth, exposing themselves as aggressors.

	The atomic bomb is not a defensive weapon. We refuse to engage in the gambles of those who want to turn one bloc of nations against another. We oppose the military alliances that have already produced so many horrific consequences. We oppose colonialism, which risks fomenting armed conflict and becoming the decisive factor in launching a terrible new war. We condemn the support of fascist regimes for the purpose of preparing for war. We condemn the rearmament of West Germany and Japan, where the world's executioners have taken up their weapons again. The deliberate and organized disruption of economic relations between countries already constitutes a form of war blockade. The war criminals of the Cold War have moved from the stage of blackmail to the stage of open preparation for war.

	But the World Congress in Defense of Peace proves the fact that the people of the whole world have ceased to be passive and are striving to play an active and constructive role. The representatives attending the Peace Congress declare: We support the United Nations Charter and oppose all military alliances that invalidate the Charter and lead to war. We oppose the heavy burden of military spending that is responsible for the disasters of nations. We support the prohibition of atomic weapons and other means of mass destruction of mankind. We demand the limitation of the armed forces of the major powers, we demand that the use of atomic energy be limited to peaceful purposes and the welfare of mankind, and we demand the establishment of effective international control.

	We fight for national independence and peaceful cooperation among all nations, and for the right of self-determination of all nations—an important condition for freedom and peace. We oppose everything that is bound to restrict and suppress democratic freedoms in order to open the way for war. We are building a world front to defend truth and reason, so as to render ineffective the propaganda that poisons public opinion.

	We denounce the hysteria of war, and the propaganda of racial hatred and national animosity. We call on everyone to unite in condemning those newspapers, books, publications, individuals and groups that spread propaganda for a new war. We have secured the unity of the people of the world, and we will devote ourselves with the same enthusiasm to the struggle for peace.

	We are determined to remain vigilant. We are establishing a truly international people's committee to defend world peace.

	This committee will put pressure on those who want to wage war, so that at every stage of rebellion they will encounter the permanent resistance of the people's forces.

	Let women, let mothers who bear the hopes of the world, know that we regard the protection of the lives of their children and the safety of their families as a sacred duty. Let young people heed us, unite regardless of political or religious beliefs, in order to remove mass slaughter from the bright road of the future. The World Congress in Defense of Peace declares that henceforth the defense of peace is the task of all peoples. The representatives of the World Congress in Defense of Peace, representing hundreds of millions of men and women, send a telegram to the people of the world, saying to them: Be brave and confident! We know how to unite. We know now how to be in harmony. We are prepared and determined to fight for the victory of the struggle for peace and survival.

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 26th: Polish News Agency, Prague dispatch: Liu Ningyi, Deputy Head of the Chinese Delegation and Vice Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, delivered a speech at the Prague Peace Congress on the 24th, condemning the atrocities of the US military in China. He said: American planes bomb cities and rural civilians, and the United States and Chiang Kai-shek collude to organize secret police to persecute the Chinese people. When Liu Ningyi spoke of the achievements of democratic China, he told everyone: There are 2.83 million trade union members in the liberated areas of China, technical training is being promoted, and workers are being promoted to leadership positions. In the Northeast, coal production and textile production have increased compared to the Japanese occupation period. In the cities of the liberated areas, factories and public utilities have started operations. The workers in the Kuomintang-controlled areas are allies of the workers in the liberated areas. Last year, 3.2 million people went on strike against Chiang Kai-shek's oppression, and the underground democratic trade unions have 800,000 members. The People's Liberation Army is helping farmers carry out land reform. In conclusion, Liu Ningyi said: The resolute attitude of the Chinese people will consolidate people's democracy and guarantee China's lasting peace.

　　代表亿万人民坚决保卫和平的意志
  　捷京和平大会通过宣言
    刘宁一演说谴责美帝在华罪行
    【新华社北平二十六日电】布拉格讯：布拉格和平大会于二十五日午通过宣言。宣言说：
    我们，来自世界七十二国的人民代表，我们，属于一切文化、一切思想和一切肤色的男女，曾经遭受过可怕的危险，而这一危险——战争的危险又再度威胁着世界。
    上次巨大的世界悲剧结束四年之后，人民正被陷入军备竞赛的危险中。科学的作用原在于保证人类的幸福，如今，有人正使它离开它的目标，迫使它服务于战争的目的。
    战争业已在越南、在印尼、在马来亚和在希腊进行着。
    聚集在这一伟大的世界和平大会上，我们声明：我们保有着自由的头脑，宣传不能影响我们的判断。我们知道，是谁曾经破坏了各大国间所缔结的，宣告不同的社会制度有并存可能性的协定。我们知道，是谁在今天破坏着联合国宪章。
    我们知道，是谁认为旨在维持各国间和平的条约仅仅是一堆废纸，是谁拒绝关于谈判和解除军备的提议，是谁正在武装到牙齿，暴露他们自己是侵略者。
    原子弹不是防卫的武器。我们拒绝进行那些想使这一国家集团反对另一国家集团的人们的赌博。我们反对那些业已制造如许恐怖后果的军事同盟。我们反对殖民主义，它有酝成武装冲突，有成为发动可怖的新战争之决定性作用的危险。我们谴责为了准备战争这一目的而扶持法西斯制度。我们谴责武装西德和日本。在那里，世界的绞刑吏取回了他们的武器。国家与国家之间经济关系之被故意和有组织地破裂，业已具有战争封锁的性质。冷战的战犯们已经从讹诈的阶段过渡到公开的准备战争的阶段。
    但是世界拥护和平大会证明，这样一个事实，即全世界的人民停止了被动而努力起着主动与建设性的作用。出席和平大会的代表们宣称：我们拥护联合国宪章并反对使该宪章失效与引导战争的一切军事联盟。我们反对那应对各国灾难负责的沉重的军费负担。我们拥护禁止原子武器及其他大量毁灭人类的手段。我们要求限制各大国的武装部队，我们要求原子能的使用只限于为和平目的与人类福利，我们要求建立有效的国际管制。
    我们为争取各民族独立与各民族间的和平合作，各民族的自决权——自由与和平的重要条件而斗争。我们反对为打开战争的道路而势必限制与压制民主自由权利的一切事情。我们建立保卫真理与理性的世界阵线，以便使毒害舆论的宣传失去作用。
    我们斥责战争的歇斯底里，斥责种族仇恨和民族仇视的宣传。我们要求大家一致起来谴责那些散布新战争宣传的报纸、书籍、刊物、个人与团体。我们曾经确保了世界人民的团结，我们也将用同样的热情致力于争取和平。
    我们决心保持警惕性。我们设立保卫世界和平的真正国际人民委员会。
    这一委员会将给要进行战争的人们以压力，使他们在每一叛乱的阶段上都遇着人民力量的永久阻力。
    让妇女们，让担负着世界希望的母亲都知道，我们把保卫她们儿童的生命和她们家庭的安全看成神圣的职责。让青年们听信我们，不分政治与宗教信仰而团结起来，以便从未来的光明大道上扫除大规模的杀戮。世界拥护和平大会宣布今后保卫和平是各族人民的任务。世界拥护和平大会的代表数亿男女致电世界人民，对他们说：要勇敢和自信！我们知道如何去团结。我们知道现在如何和谐一致。我们已准备并决心争取为和平与生存而斗争的胜利。
    【新华社北平二十六日电】波兰通讯社布拉格讯，中国代表团副团长中华全国总工会副主席刘宁一二十四日在布拉格和平大会上发表演说，谴责美军在中国的暴行。他说：美国的飞机轰炸城市与乡村的平民，美国与蒋介石合伙组织秘密警察迫害中国人民。刘宁一说到民主中国的成就时，告诉大家说：中国解放区有职工会会员二百八十三万人，技术训练正在推进中，工人正被提拔到领导职位。在东北，煤产与纺织生产已比日本占领时期增高。在解放区的城市中，工厂与公用企业已在开工。在国民党统治区的工人是解放区工人的盟友。去年有三百二十万人罢工反对蒋介石的压迫，地下的民主职工会有会员八十万人。解放军正在帮助农民进行土地改革。刘宁一在结语中说：中国人民大众的坚决态度，将巩固人民的民主和保证中国的持久和平。
