　　The Second Day of the National Congress of the Youth League
  　Comrade Ren Bishi Delivers Political Report
　　[Our Newspaper News] The first National Congress of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League held its second day. Three hundred and forty-six delegates attended, including six newly arrived. In the morning, Comrade Ren Bishi, Chairman of the Youth League Preparatory Committee, delivered a political report on behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. After outlining the current situation and tasks, Comrade Bishi elaborated on the leadership of the youth movement. He said that historical facts over the past thirty years have fully demonstrated that the Communist Party of China is the best leader and protector of Chinese youth. He pointed out that, on the one hand, the Youth League must clearly recognize the absolute necessity of accepting the leadership of the Party, ensuring the complete trust of its members and the broad masses of youth in the Communist Party; on the other hand, Party committees at all levels must deeply recognize that strengthening the leadership over the youth movement is one of the most important tasks for the Party in the current victorious development of the revolutionary situation. After pointing out the basic tasks and work positions of the Youth League, he clearly stated that the youth work during the period of the Communist Youth League and the National Salvation Youth League, although there had been errors and biases, was basically successful. He proposed that we should now be more open and allow the cadres engaged in youth work to boldly carry out the work of nation-building. Comrade Bishi's report gave great encouragement to all the delegates, especially when Comrade Bishi mentioned that the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao Zedong were very concerned and attached great importance to the establishment of the Youth League, the whole audience burst into thunderous applause. In the afternoon, Comrade Feng Wenbin, Deputy Director of the Youth League Preparatory Committee, reported on the work and tasks of the Youth League. He explained that the basic task of the Youth League is to study in the combination of Marxism-Leninism and revolutionary practice. The current task of the Youth League is to closely link study with the general task of the Chinese people, which is to restore and develop production. He specifically explained the working principles of the Youth League in factories, schools, and rural areas, as well as the working methods, working style, relationship with various parties, and the work of the Central Committee of the League. In addition, he pointed out that the focus of the Youth League's work is in the cities, but at the same time, rural areas should also be taken into account.
　　The Congress today received congratulatory telegrams from Generals Liu Bocheng, Deng Xiaoping, Zhang Jichun, and Li Da of the Second Field Army of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and all its commanders and fighters, Generals Lin Biao and Luo Ronghuan of the Fourth Field Army and all its commanders and fighters, all commanders and fighters of the 19th Army Corps, the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, and others.

　　I. Current Situation and Tasks
　　The characteristic of the current situation is that the reactionary ruling forces of the Kuomintang have been basically defeated by the people's forces. Whether it is by peaceful means or by war, it will not take long for the People's Liberation Army to achieve victory throughout China. We must make final efforts to realize this national victory, and at the same time make greater efforts to begin building a New Democratic country. The primary task of this construction is to restore and develop industrial and agricultural production, especially industrial production, in order to consolidate China's independence and unity.
　　The reactionary group representing the feudal landlord and bureaucrat-comprador class—the Kuomintang reactionaries—during the Anti-Japanese War, wanted to use the power of Japanese fascism to achieve their goal of weakening and eliminating the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army. They were actively and diligently anti-communist, but passively resistant to Japan, using the name of resistance to Japan to accumulate strength to carry out an anti-people civil war. This coincided with the intentions of the world's imperialist reactionary forces, especially American imperialism. But the Kuomintang's hope of eliminating the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army by borrowing Japan's power did not materialize. Under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the support of the people, the Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army became the backbone of the Chinese people's defeat of Japanese imperialism (without them, China would have become a Japanese colony long ago), and they strengthened themselves in the War of Resistance Against Japan.
　　After Japan surrendered, the Kuomintang reactionaries, with the help of American imperialism, finally launched a full-scale civil war. At the beginning of the war, the Kuomintang had a total of 4.3 million land, sea, and air forces, while the People's Liberation Army had only 1.28 million at the time, with no air force or navy, and very few artillery pieces. The Kuomintang was confident that based on its military advantage and the various aids from American imperialism, it would surely achieve victory and estimated that the People's Liberation Army could be eliminated within three months or half a year. Although numerically inferior, the People's Liberation Army, which implemented the correct political and military line and was therefore supported by the people, combined with the efforts of the entire liberated area and the people of the whole country, after a year of arduous defensive battles, at the beginning of the second year of the war, that is, in July 1947, turned into a national-scale offensive, and the Kuomintang reactionary army turned from offensive to defensive. This was a historically significant transformation. Since then, in addition to recovering most of the land and cities lost in the first year, the People's Liberation Army has also led the war to the areas ruled by the Kuomintang north of the Yangtze River, cultivated its own artillery from the captured materials, built its own engineering corps, and thus was able to capture a number of medium-sized cities, such as Shijiazhuang, Sipingjie, Luoyang, Weixian, and Kaifeng. The fighting power and military prestige of the People's Liberation Army have been greatly improved.
　　By the third year of the war, the People's Liberation Army was not only incomparable to the Kuomintang reactionary army in terms of quality, but also surpassed the Kuomintang reactionary army in terms of quantity. Up to now, in two years and nine months (from July 1946 to March 1949), a total of 4.95 million Kuomintang reactionary troops have been eliminated. The current Kuomintang counter-revolutionary army has been reduced from 4.3 million to only 1.1 million combat troops and hundreds of thousands of logistics units. Many of these remaining combat troops have been replenished after being eliminated once or more, their combat effectiveness is very weak, and they are scattered in a very wide area from Dihua to Taiwan. The People's Liberation Army, on the other hand, has increased from 1.28 million to more than 3 million during the same period, and its equipment is no less than the best land forces of the Kuomintang equipped by the United States.
　　Along with the development of military victory, the territory and population of the liberated areas have also expanded and increased. According to statistics at the beginning of March, the area of ​​the liberated areas is now 2,601,000 square kilometers, accounting for 27 percent of the country's area. The entire Northeast and almost the entire region north of the lower and middle reaches of the Yangtze River have been liberated. The population of the liberated areas has reached more than 200 million. The land problem has been thoroughly solved in areas including more than 100 million people; in these areas, peasants who had no or little land in the past have acquired land, and the landlord class, as a class, has been eliminated. Within the vast liberated areas, there is a considerable foundation of light and heavy industry and railway transportation, and there are extremely important strategic resources, such as coal, iron, grain, cotton, salt, kerosene, and wood. Distributed in this vast liberated area and among the 3 million troops, there are 3 million Communist Party members; in the liberated area, there are tens of millions of mass organizations and militia organizations such as workers, women, and youth. Industrial and agricultural production in the liberated areas is beginning to recover, and financial prices are more stable than in the Kuomintang areas. The influence of the Communist Party among the people of the whole country has greatly increased, the people's confidence in victory is very strong, and the morale of the People's Liberation Army is very high.
　　The victorious development of the people's forces is also the failure and brevity of the Kuomintang. With the Kuomintang's military failure, it is also disintegrating politically and economically. The gold yuan coupons issued not long ago have been reduced to the status of pseudo-legal tender. American imperialism and the Kuomintang have reached an unprecedented level of isolation in front of the Chinese people. All the intermediate forces that were still wavering in the past have now become closer to the people's side. In short, the comparison of the people's forces and the Kuomintang reactionary forces has undergone an absolutely favorable change for the people in the past year. After the three major battles of Liaoshen, Huaihai, and Pingjin, the Kuomintang's reactionary rule has been basically defeated by the People's Liberation Army. No assistance from American imperialism can change the fate of the Kuomintang's demise.
　　Finally, to eliminate the reactionary military forces and ruling institutions left over by the Kuomintang and to achieve a complete victory of the revolution throughout China is the work that the Chinese people must continue to work hard on without slackening. This problem can be solved in the following ways: one is to continue with the war method, that is, the so-called Tianjin method, to completely annihilate this one million Kuomintang reactionary army within half a year to a year; if this needs to be done, the People's Liberation Army is fully confident of doing so. People all over China and even the world, including the Kuomintang reactionaries, will believe this. The other is to resolve the Kuomintang reactionary military forces and ruling institutions in a peaceful way according to the eight peace conditions proposed by Chairman Mao on January 14, which is the so-called Beiping method. Although this method is not as simple and quick as the Tianjin method and cannot achieve the purpose of complete transformation so quickly, it can avoid destruction and manpower consumption.
　　For these two methods of solving the remaining reactionary forces in China, we welcome the second one, but at the same time we must prepare for the first one, and only by severely attacking all parts that resist peaceful resolution can we more easily strive to completely solve the China problem in a peaceful way. But no matter which method is used, we must strive to make the Nanjing government quickly hand over its power in order to convene a new political consultative conference, produce the central government of a new democratic country, and realize China's complete liberation and unification.
　　From the above situation, we can see that we are not far from the period of victory throughout China. This victory has extremely important historical significance for China and the world. This will produce a significant change in the balance of democratic and anti-democratic forces in the world. However, we must recognize the profound significance of Chairman Mao's instruction that "to seize the victory throughout the country is only the first step in the Long March," and understand that completely defeating the Kuomintang reactionary military forces militarily and completely destroying all the Kuomintang reactionary ruling institutions politically means completing China's unification, which is a historically significant event, but it does not mean that China has finally achieved complete independence and autonomy. Chairman Mao emphatically pointed out: "Eliminating imperialism, feudalism, bureaucratic capitalism, and the Kuomintang rule (which is a concentrated manifestation of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism) from China has not completely solved the problem of China's independence and autonomy. Only when the economy has achieved great development, and the backward agricultural country has become an advanced industrial country, and the economy is completely independent of foreign countries, can this problem be finally solved."
　　According to Chairman Mao's estimation, "The proportion of industry and agriculture in the national economy in China, on a national scale, is about 10 percent for industry and 90 percent for agriculture." A considerable part of this approximately 10 percent of industry has been destroyed due to the influence of the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan and the three-year civil war. If we want to make China completely independent economically, we must not only strive to restore the destroyed industry within three to five years, but also have a plan to increase the proportion of industry in the national economy from about 10 percent to 30 to 40 percent within 10 to 15 years, so that China has a fairly strong machine manufacturing industry that produces a large number of machines and vehicles needed for the development of industry, mining, and transportation, and that China's own industry can produce artillery, tanks, and aircraft needed for national defense. Only then can it be said that China has not only achieved an independent position economically, but also has sufficient strength in national defense to protect its sacred and inviolable borders. Only when industry develops, production technology is improved, and production costs are gradually reduced, and a huge number of finished products can be produced, is it possible to gradually improve the living standards of the working class itself and the people, to further consolidate the alliance between workers and peasants, to truly exert the role of cities in leading the countryside, and to lay a solid economic foundation for the future transition to socialism.
　　In the process of restoring and developing industry and striving to make China industrialized, we should first create all the conditions for the rapid development of socialist public enterprises. To this end, we must invest as much capital as possible that can be accumulated in state-owned and public enterprises. We must transform the enterprises taken over from the Kuomintang reactionary rule and bureaucratic capital, preserve everything that is reasonably usable, remove everything that is unreasonable, and create new and applicable things, so that enterprise management and labor organization are more rationalized. It is necessary to educate and transform the old technical cadres. As long as they can change their understanding and attitude towards the working class and establish the viewpoint of serving the people, they should be welcomed by the people and the democratic government. More importantly, we must systematically train a large number of technical cadres from skilled workers, especially young workers; without a large number of hundreds of thousands or even millions of excellent and reliable newly trained technical cadres—various engineers, technicians..., then do not imagine that China can be transformed into an advanced industrialized country. In the restoration and development of industry, all private enterprises that are beneficial to the national economy should be allowed to exist and develop. This policy of the Party is completely necessary under the conditions in China. Private capital should be subject to certain restrictions so that it does not go beyond the track required by the national economy, but it is also wrong to fear the development of private capital and therefore impose inappropriate restrictions.
　　Due to the rapid victory of the war, not only have the liberated areas that were divided by the enemy in the past become one, but there are also a number of large and medium-sized cities, and a large number of cities will soon be liberated. In these cities and their surroundings, there are many industries, businesses, and schools concentrated, and railways and shipping connect the various cities. This situation presents the Chinese people and the Communist Party with a new policy of shifting the focus of work from the countryside to the cities. In the past, because the cities were occupied by powerful enemies, we placed the focus of work in the countryside, mobilized the peasants to carry out struggles to weaken feudalism (reducing rent and interest) until feudalism was eliminated (distributing land), organized troops, and used the countryside to surround the cities, and then seize the cities. The policy has proven to be completely correct in practice. On the contrary, the view that only focuses on cities and ignores the countryside, which existed in the history of the Chinese revolution, has proven to be completely wrong in practice. But now the new situation puts forward the tasks and focus of work in the new period. The period of focusing on the countryside in the past has ended, and a new period of going from cities to the countryside and leading the countryside from the cities has begun. When we march south to the Yangtze River, we will also go to the cities first, and then carry out work in the countryside. Therefore, we must learn to manage and build cities, learn to organize, lead, and rely on the working class in the cities, unite other working people, win over intellectuals, and win over the petty bourgeoisie and the free bourgeoisie to fight with us against imperialism, the Kuomintang, and the bureaucratic bourgeoisie. We must restore, reform, and establish the cultural and educational work of the cities, so that a large number of schools can train a large number of useful talents for the new democratic society. The central link of urban work is to restore and develop production undertakings, and all other work should revolve around this central work and serve it. If we enter the city and do not rely on the working class, do not take the restoration and development of production undertakings as the central work, but rely on the poor and other classes, and busy ourselves with other less important activities, it will inevitably cause damage to the overall work.
　　We say that the focus of work should now be shifted from the countryside to the cities, and a certain amount of power should be transferred to strengthen urban work, but if we abandon the countryside and transfer all the rural work force to the cities, it is also wrong, and must be prevented and opposed. Most of China's population lives in the countryside, and they have a lot of work to do. In order to develop industry, the countryside must be able to supply a large amount of raw materials, such as cotton, soybeans, peanuts, tobacco leaves, hemp..., and the countryside must supply the cities with a large amount of grain. Since the scattered individual agricultural economy accounts for 90 percent of the national economy in quantity, this shows that today we still have to rely on farmers to produce a large amount of grain and raw materials. The feudal forces in the rural areas of the liberated areas have been eliminated or are being eliminated, and there is full room for the development of agricultural productivity. We must strive to lead farmers to improve agricultural technology, improve water conservancy, seeds, fertilizers, etc., to greatly increase the production of agricultural products. In the countryside, we must organize a large number of production, consumption, and supply and marketing cooperatives that farmers think are necessary. We must greatly increase agricultural output, also because we want to use it to exchange with foreign countries for the machines necessary for restoring and developing industry. In addition, we must also strive to do the work of improving the culture of farmers in the countryside. The above-mentioned series of rural work needs to obtain the guidance and help of urban workers and intellectuals, and needs the strong leadership and efforts of the Communist Party, in order to do it well.
　　As mentioned above, although we are close to a national victory—and this requires unremitting and serious efforts and overcoming difficulties to complete—however, in order to make China completely independent and autonomous, we still need extremely significant and arduous efforts. All those who think that the revolution will soon be victorious and can relax, or think that they have worked hard for decades and have done their best, sweated, and shed blood for the people, and can now enjoy themselves, should be considered unhealthy. It is important to know that construction is many times more difficult than destruction. A revolutionary political party, if it only knows how to destroy the old but does not know how to build the new, if it cannot build the new and indeed make the people live a better life politically, economically, and culturally than they did in the old society, then the people will oppose it out of dissatisfaction, and it will eventually fail. Therefore, we must recognize that after achieving victory throughout the country, we must make the same efforts as in the past, maintain the style of hard struggle, diligence, and thrift, and be prepared to save every penny to accumulate a share of strength for the economic construction of the new society. Only in this way, after another ten to fifteen years of effort, can we say that our victory has been finally consolidated, and then we can possibly live a more prosperous and cultural life with the people.
　　We still have such arduous tasks ahead of us, and the legacy left to us by the old society is so poor and backward. Even so, we must never have any pessimism. On the basis of the strength of the 400 million brave and hardworking people, with the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the leader of the Chinese people, Mao Zedong, plus the help of the Soviet Union and the proletariat of all countries in the world, we have reason to believe that China's economic construction will be faster than the development after the Soviet October Revolution.
　　The current international situation is: the democratic camp headed by the Soviet Union is growing stronger. The industrial economies of the Soviet Union and the New Democratic countries in Eastern Europe have recovered and even exceeded the pre-war level, and the people's economic and cultural life is also improving. The strength of the world's democratic camp clearly exceeds the strength of the imperialist anti-democratic camp. The anti-democratic camp headed by American imperialism is facing increasing difficulties. The American imperialism, known as "powerful" after the war, is striving to postpone the arrival of its domestic economic crisis as much as possible by creating new war horrors, but signs of crisis have already appeared. The American aid to Chiang Kai-shek's anti-communist war in China has suffered failure. The victory of the Chinese revolution will completely break through the chains of imperialism in the East, and hundreds of millions of people in Southeast Asia are carrying out heroic struggles under the influence of the Chinese revolution. The Marshall Plan promoted by the United States in Europe has led the economy of Western Europe to a dead end, making the aided countries increasingly dependent on the United States, and therefore suffering increasing opposition from the people of those countries. Because of the approaching economic crisis, some enterprises in the United States have begun to reduce production, the lives of workers are declining, unemployment panic is growing, and the democratic forces of the people are gradually strengthening. Recently, the United States and Britain have again used the North Atlantic Treaty, and will try to use the Pacific Treaty and other methods in the future to step up preparations for war and strengthen the United States' control over the "benefited" countries in order to escape the crisis. However, the people of the whole world, including the American people, do not want the war to come. As long as the world's working class and all democratic forces maintain full vigilance and effort, the war crisis can be overcome. Even if the imperialists really provoke a war, the world's people's democratic forces have the confidence to defeat and eliminate the imperialist forces. All this shows that today's international environment is extremely conducive to the smooth development of our Chinese revolutionary struggle. All views that overestimate the power of the imperialist enemy too much and underestimate the power of the people of the whole world too much are wrong.
　　II. Strengthen the Leadership of the Chinese Youth Movement
　　Chinese young workers, peasants, and students have their own glorious history in the process of the Chinese New Democratic Revolution. In the May Fourth Movement, the May 30th Movement, the Northern Expedition War, the Land Revolution, the December 9th Movement, the Eight-Year War of Resistance Against Japan, the Patriotic Democratic Movement after the War of Resistance, and the Three-Year People's Liberation War, Chinese youth have stood at the forefront of heroic struggles and made brilliant contributions to the people's revolutionary movement. The modern revolutionary history of the past thirty years proves that the Chinese youth movement is an important part of the Chinese revolutionary movement. Comrade Stalin said in 1926: "In China, the youth problem is now of paramount importance, student youth (revolutionary students), young workers, young peasants—all these forces can push the Chinese revolution forward." Chairman Mao said in his speech at the meeting in Yan'an commemorating the 24th anniversary of the "May Fourth" Movement: "What role have Chinese youth played since the May Fourth Movement? They played a vanguard role, that is, a leading role, that is, standing at the forefront of the revolutionary ranks." These arguments are completely in line with the actual situation in China. The reason why Chinese youth can play this role is, as Stalin analyzed: "We should know that no one suffers from imperialist oppression so deeply and urgently, and no one feels the need to fight against this oppression so sharply and painfully, as the youth of China."
　　We are now close to the victory of the revolution throughout the country, but we are required to make the final efforts, and we are faced with the extremely serious historical task of building a new China. Without the mobilization and efforts of all the people, this task cannot be completed. When mobilizing the people's forces, we must focus on mobilizing the youth forces and give full play to the active role of the broad masses of youth. According to the current general working policy of the Chinese Communist Party, on the one hand, we must make the youth actively participate in and support the final march of the People's Liberation Army—to reach all parts south of the Yangtze River; on the other hand, we must make the broad masses of youth actively participate in various construction works, especially in the restoration and development of industry and the improvement of agricultural production. In order to strengthen the leadership of the youth movement, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China specially passed a resolution on January 1 this year to establish a unified national organization of youth mass activists—the Chinese New Democratic Youth League. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China issued this resolution after very careful consideration. In order to gain experience in establishing the Youth League, pilot projects have been started in various places since October 1946. The experience of these pilot projects proves that the organization of the Youth League is necessary. We believe that the Party committees of the Communist Party in various places will resolutely implement this resolution.
　　The experience of the youth movement in the past tells us that there must be an organization of youth mass activists as the leading core of the youth masses in order to more powerfully promote the development of the youth movement. The National Salvation Youth League established in the early days of the War of Resistance Against Japan—a youth organization that included almost all young people—played a positive role in the early days of the Anti-Japanese Movement, but it could not meet the needs of the youth masses in the later period of the War of Resistance. Now, without a relatively strong organization of youth activists as a pillar, it is not easy to unite the strength of the youth, nor can it concentrate the expression of the youth's will and actions. The youth movement will inevitably fall into a state of disunity and weakness.
　　At the same time, under the current situation of national revolutionary development, there is also an urgent need for such a unified national organization that includes all progressive youth activists. The social foundation of this organization should be broader than that of the Communist Youth League in the past. Although it should be based mainly on young workers, peasants, and revolutionary intellectuals, it must also be able to unite progressive youth from all walks of life in the country, and absorb the best of them into the League. In the New Democratic Youth League, there should be systematic and vivid Marxist-Leninist education that combines theory and practice, so that each member has a firm dialectical materialist revolutionary outlook on life and the viewpoint of serving the people, understands the laws of social development, and consciously strives to follow these laws. The New Democratic Youth League with such awareness will inevitably become a capable assistant to the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Democratic Government in the great cause of finally resolving the enemy, especially in building a New Democratic China.
　　Ensuring the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party over the Chinese New Democratic Youth League is the decisive factor for the correct forward development of the Chinese youth movement. The historical facts of the past thirty years fully demonstrate that the Chinese Communist Party is the best leader and protector of Chinese youth. Since the birth of the Chinese Communist Party, the reason why the great youth movements have achieved brilliant results is inseparable from the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. If it deviates from the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, or when the Chinese Communist Party's leadership over the youth movement has certain deviations, then the youth movement there will also suffer a certain degree of loss accordingly.
　　"Ensuring the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party over the youth movement" contains two meanings: On the one hand, the leading cadres and all members of the New Democratic Youth League must clearly and deeply recognize the absolute necessity of accepting the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, resolutely implement and obey all the policies and resolutions of the Chinese Communist Party, study Marxist-Leninist theory and the style of the Communist Party, and ensure the complete trust of all members and the broad masses of youth in the Chinese Communist Party; on the other hand, the Party committees at all levels of the Chinese Communist Party must not abandon or relax their leadership responsibilities for the youth movement, and should place youth work in a proper position and give it the necessary care and help. It is necessary to deeply recognize that strengthening the leadership over the youth movement is "one of the most important tasks for the Party in the current victorious development of the revolutionary situation" (Resolution of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the Establishment of the New Democratic Youth League). While strengthening the leadership of the Youth League, we should also pay attention to respecting the due organizational independence of the Youth League and not interfere with the Youth League in everything organizationally.
　　The basic task of the Youth League is to unite and educate the entire younger generation, and its work position should obviously not be limited to the narrow scope of young students. On the contrary, it is necessary to pay more attention to carrying out work among young workers and peasants, and mainly to rely on the masses of young workers and peasants. Today, when we have grasped the big cities, and at the present time when the focus of the Communist Party's work is shifting from the countryside to the cities, it is necessary to especially strengthen the work among the young workers, and to pay special attention to developing members among the young workers and apprentices, requiring that every major enterprise or every railway, every mine, have an organization of the Youth League, so that the proportion of young workers in the Youth League organization increases. Under the principle of not relaxing rural youth work, the main position of youth work should be placed in the work of young workers in various enterprises in the cities.
　　The main purpose of the Youth League in carrying out work among young workers is to improve the production enthusiasm of young workers and to be a model for observing labor discipline and saving production raw materials. In learning technology and skills, and in the production competition movement, they should be able to play a pioneering and leading role. Young worker members of the League should become activists participating in the trade union. In addition to accepting the leadership of the Party branch, the Youth League in the factory must maintain a correct relationship with the trade union. Organizationally, both the Youth League and the trade union are under the leadership of the Communist Party, but the Youth League should carry out work among young workers so that young workers consciously and automatically abide by and respond to the various regulations and calls of the public enterprises, factories, or trade unions. And when the trade union determines issues related to youth work, it should solicit and respect the opinions of the Youth League. The Minister or Deputy Minister of the Youth Work Department of the same-level trade union should preferably be staffed by Youth League personnel.
　　In the countryside, the Youth League should continue to focus on developing the League's organization, absorbing outstanding members from among farm laborers, poor peasants, and middle peasants into the League. Progressive awakened members from new rich peasants and rural intellectuals can also be absorbed into the League, but it must be ensured that the leading members of the League are mainly young people from farm laborers and poor peasant backgrounds. In rural Youth League members in areas that have implemented land reform in the past, they should become activists in increasing agricultural production (including sideline occupations), leading the broad masses of young peasants to cooperate with adult peasants in changing labor, carrying out deep plowing and fine cultivation, improving water conservancy, planting more grain, producing more cotton and other agricultural products necessary for the development of industry, and actively participating in the cooperative movement in the countryside. In the newly liberated areas, youth work should be carried out in accordance with the Communist Party's policy for new areas, preparing to move from rent reduction to land distribution, while not allowing production to decline.
　　Building the League in the army is an extremely important task, and its principles and steps can be implemented in accordance with the instructions given by Commander-in-Chief Zhu in his opening speech.
　　The Chinese student movement has a very glorious historical tradition. Young students are easy to receive progressive ideas, and they have knowledge. It is hoped that they will pay attention to cultivating themselves into useful talents for building a New Democratic country in their studies. Therefore, it is necessary to strengthen the work among students in the future. In various universities, middle schools, and vocational schools, the League's organization should be established step by step and in a planned way to carry out the League's work. The Youth League members among the students should become models for learning, especially striving to learn the sciences that are beneficial to building a new society. At the same time, they should actively participate in various work of the student union, relying on their excellent academic performance and exemplary practical actions to gain the trust of their classmates, so that the League's organization in the school truly becomes an organization that unites excellent students and is supported by ordinary students.
　　In order to develop industry and agriculture, the government will open a large number of cadre schools and training courses to train cadres in industry, agriculture, and medicine and health. The Youth League in cities and rural areas has the task of providing a large number of excellent members and young workers, peasants, and revolutionary student intellectuals to study in these schools and training courses, in order to train a large number of construction talents for the New Democratic country—industrial and agricultural specialists, engineers, technicians, and cadres who can manage factories and farms.
　　The Youth League wants to carry out work among young people of various professions and different work departments. Its overall goal is to unite and educate the younger generation, and to lead young people to study various theories and practices for building a New Democratic China. Therefore, the learning problem is the common central activity of all Youth Leagues in different professions and different departments. The meaning of learning has two aspects: On the one hand, learning Marxist-Leninist theory combined with the practice of the Chinese revolution and Mao Zedong Thought in a systematic way, learning scientific and technical knowledge, and improving the ideological, political, and cultural level of the Youth League members and the broad masses of youth. On the other hand, learning the practical application of Marxism-Leninism in various specific tasks. That is to say, learning should be combined with one's own practical work. Youth League members in factories should strive to become skilled model workers in the factory; Youth League members in rural areas should strive to become knowledgeable model peasants in the rural areas; Youth League members in the army should strive to become cultural model soldiers or combat heroes; Youth League members in schools should strive to become thoughtful model students in schools; Youth League members in various work posts should strive to become model workers in their respective work posts. To sum up, the basic task of the Youth League is to lead and inspire all Youth League members and the broad masses of youth to continuously learn and make continuous progress in various practical work, so as to enable the revolutionary cause of the New Democratic China to cultivate thousands of excellent revolutionary reserve forces with high political awareness and strong practical working ability, continuously replenish various work posts, promote the revolutionary cause, build a New Democratic society that is indeed much better than the old society, and prepare for entering a socialist society in the future.
　　The work of the Youth League has had deviations in the past history. In order for the Youth League's work and the youth movement to develop smoothly in the future, there must be a correct and appropriate view on several historical deviations in the youth movement, so as to avoid many comrades not being able to bravely and freely establish the Youth League's organization and hinder the development of the youth movement. The youth work during the period of the Communist Youth League and the National Salvation Youth League in the past should be estimated as basically successful and with achievements. The Chinese Socialist Youth League (the predecessor of the Chinese Communist Youth League), established in 1920, was born before the Chinese Communist Party. To a certain extent, it played an ideological and organizational preparatory role for the work of building the Party. From 1920 to the period of the Great Revolution in 1927, the Youth League had a considerable influence among the Chinese people, especially young students and intellectuals. The "Chinese Youth" weekly, edited by comrades Yun Daiying and Xiao Chunu, had a great influence among Chinese students and intellectuals and a part of young workers in major cities, especially in introducing communist ideas and in ideological struggles with the reactionary nationalist faction (i.e., the current Youth Party). Youth League members were also active participants in various anti-imperialist and anti-warlord movements and the Northern Expedition War, as well as in the peasant movements in Guangdong, Hunan, and Hubei. However, due to the influence of the Youth League being established before the Party, and the

　　报告原文
    一、目前形势与任务
    目前时局的特点，就是国民党反动统治的力量已经在基本上被人民的力量所打垮，不管是用和平的方式或用战争的方式，都不需要很久的时间，人民解放军就可以在全中国取得胜利。我们要用最后的努力来实现这一全国胜利，同时又要用更大的努力开始来建设新民主主义的国家，这个建设的首要工作是恢复和发展工业和农业生产，特别是工业生产，以巩固中国的独立与统一。
    代表封建地主，官僚买办阶级的反动集团——国民党反动派，在抗日时期，就想借日本法西斯的力量来达到他削弱和消灭八路军新四军的目的。它对反共是积极努力的，而对抗日则是消极的，借抗日之名以积蓄力量来进行反人民的内战。这与全世界帝国主义反动势力，特别是美国帝国主义的意图是相吻合的。但是国民党借日本的力量来消灭八路军新四军的希望并未能实现，八路军新四军在中国共产党的正确领导和人民群众的拥护之下，成了中国人民击败日本帝国主义的中坚（没有它中国早就变成了日本的殖民地），而且在抗日战争中壮大了自己。
    日本投降以后，国民党反动派在美国帝国主义帮助之下，终于发动了全面的内战。在战争开始时，国民党共有陆海空军兵力总共四百三十万人，而人民解放军当时只有一百二十八万，既没有空军海军，大炮也为数极少。国民党满以为依据他在军事上的优势，和美国帝国主义的各种帮助，一定可以获致胜利，并曾预计在三个月或是半年之内定可消灭人民解放军。在数量上虽占劣势，但是执行正确的政治军事路线因而受到人民拥护的人民解放军，与全解放区和全国人民的努力相结合，经过一年艰苦的防御战斗之后，在战争第二年的开始，即一九四七年的七月，就转入了全国规模的进攻，国民党反动军队则由进攻转为防御。这是一个带有历史意义的转变。从此，解放军除大部收复了在第一年所失去的土地、城池之外，并且把战争引到长江以北国民党统治的地区，从缴获中培养了自己的炮兵，建设了自己的工兵，因而也就能攻克一批中等城市，如石家庄、四平街、洛阳、潍县、开封等，解放军的战斗力和军威大为提高了。
    到了战争的第三年，人民解放军不仅在质量上是国民党反动军队不可比拟的，而且在数量上也超过了国民党反动军队，到现在为止，在两年零九个月中（一九四六年七月到一九四九年三月），共消灭国民党反动军队四百九十五万人。现在的国民党反革命军队已经由四百三十万降到只有一百一十万战斗部队及数十万后勤机关部队，这些残余的战斗部队中许多是经过一次或一次以上消灭后补充起来的，战斗力既很薄弱，而且散布在迪化到台湾这一非常宽广的区域之内。人民解放军则于同时期内由一百二十八万增加到三百万人以上，其装备则毫不亚于美国装备的国民党的最优良的陆军。
    与军事胜利发展的同时，解放区的地域与人口也扩大与增加了。据三月初统计，现在解放区的面积有二百六十万一千平方公里，占全国面积百分之二十七。整个东北和几乎是整个长江下游和中游以北地区，都已被解放。解放区的人口已达二万万以上。在包括一万万人口以上的地区之内，已经彻底地解决了土地问题；在这种地区内，过去无地或少地的农民，都获得了土地，地主阶级当作一个阶级来说是已经被消灭了。在广阔的解放区之内，有相当的轻重工业铁路运输的基础，有极重要的战略性的资源，如煤、铁、粮食、棉花、盐、煤油、木材等。分布在这一广大的解放区内及三百多万军队中，有三百万共产党员；在解放区内，有数以千万计的工人、妇女、青年等群众组织及民兵组织。解放区内工业农业正开始恢复，金融物价也比较国民党区域为稳定。共产党在全中国人民中的影响大为增加，人民胜利的信心非常坚强，解放军的士气甚为高涨。
    人民力量的胜利发展，亦即国民党的失败与短小。随着国民党在军事上的失败，在政治上、经济上也日益土崩瓦解起来。发行不久的金圆券，已经降到伪法币的地位。美国帝国主义与国民党在中国人民面前，达到从来未有过的孤立。一切过去还动摇着的中间力量，现在已经更加靠近于人民方面。总而言之，人民的力量与国民党反动势力的对比，在最近一年之内是起着对人民方面绝对有利的变化，经过辽沈、淮海与平津三大战役之后，国民党的反动统治，已经在基本上被解放军所打垮。美国帝国主义的任何援助，也不能改变国民党灭亡的命运了。
    最后肃清国民党存留的反动军事力量和统治机构，使革命在全中国获得彻底的胜利，是中国人民目前应当继续努力不可松懈的工作。解决这一问题可采取下列方式：一种是继续以战争的方式，就是所谓天津方式，在半年到一年之内，全部歼灭这一百多万国民党反动军队；如果需要这样做的话，那人民解放军是完全有把握做得到的。全中国以至于全世界的人们，连国民党反动派在内，都会相信这一点。另一个是按照毛主席在一月十四日所提出的八项和平条件，用和平方式来解决国民党反动军事力量和统治机构，就是所谓北平方式。这种方式虽然没有如天津方式那样干脆痛快，那样能迅速达到彻底改造的目的，但是可以避免破坏和人力的消耗。
    对于这两种解决中国残余反动势力的办法，我们欢迎第二种，但同时必须准备第一种，而且只有痛击一切反抗和平解决的部分，才更易于争取用和平方式来彻底解决中国问题。但不管用那一种方式，我们都要努力使南京政府迅速交出自己的权力，以便召开新的政治协商会议，产生新民主主义国家的中央政府，实现中国的完全解放与统一。
    由上述情况可以看见，我们离在全中国胜利的时期已经不远了。这种胜利对于中国和世界都具有极为重大的历史意义。这对世界民主与反民主力量的比重上，会产生有重大意义的变化。然而我们要认识毛主席关于“夺取全国胜利，这只是万里长征走完了第一步”这个指示的深远的意义，要懂得在军事上完全打败国民党反动军事力量，在政治上完全摧毁国民党一切反动统治机构，这是完成了中国的统一，是一件有历史意义的事件，但这还不等于中国就已经最后地达到了完全的独立自主。毛主席着重指出说：“从中国境内肃清了帝国主义，封建主义，官僚资本主义和国民党的统治（这是帝国主义封建主义和官僚资本主义三者的集中表现），还没有完全解决中国的独立自主的问题。只有待经济上获得广大的发展，由落后的农业国变成了先进的工业国，经济上完全不依赖外国了，经济上完全独立了，才算最后的解决了这个问题。”
    根据毛主席的估计，“中国的工业和农业在国民经济中的比重，就全国范围来说，大约是工业占百分之十左右，农业占百分之九十左右”。这百分之十左右的工业，因为八年抗战和三年内战的影响，相当部分已被破坏。我们要使中国在经济上达到完全独立，则不独要努力争取被破坏的工业能够在三年五年内恢复，而且要有计划地在十年至十五年之内，使工业在国民经济中由百分之十左右的比重，上升到百分之三十到四十的比重，使中国有相当强大的机器制造工业，生产大量发展工矿交通业所需要的机器和车船，而且要达到中国自己的工业能够生产国防上需要的大炮，坦克以及飞机等，到了那时，才可以说中国不仅在经济上达到独立的地位，而且在国防上也具备有足够力量来保护自己神圣不可侵犯的边疆。只有工业发展起来，生产技术随着提高，生产成本日渐减低，能出产极大数量的成品，才有可能逐渐提高工人阶级自己和人民的生活水平，才更能巩固工农间的联盟，真正发挥城市领导乡村的作用，才是替将来转向社会主义打下了强固的经济基础。
    在恢复和发展工业，努力使中国达到工业化的过程中，我们应当首先使带着社会主义性质的公营企业获得迅速发展的一切条件。为此，我们必须把可能积累的资本，多多地投入国营公营企业里去。我们必须改造从国民党反动统治，官僚资本手里接收过来的企业，保存一切合理可用的东西，去掉一切不合理的东西，创立新的适用的东西，使企业管理劳动组织等更加合理化。教育改造旧有技术干部，只要他们能改变对工人阶级的认识和态度，树立为人民服务的观点，是应当受到人民和民主政府欢迎的。更为重要的，我们要从熟练工人，特别是青年工人中有计划的培养出大批的技术干部；没有大批的数以十万乃至百万计的优秀的可靠的新培养出来的技术干部——各种工程师、技师……，那就不要设想能够把中国变为先进的工业化的国家。在恢复和发展工业中，对于一切有利于国民经济的私人企业，应当允许其存在与发展。党的这个政策，是在中国的条件下完全必要的。私人资本应受到一定的限制，不使它走出国民经济需要的轨道以外，但惧怕私人资本的发展，因而加以不适当的限制，也是不对的。
    由于战争迅速胜利发展，不仅使过去被敌人分割的解放区打成为一片，而且有了一批大的和大批中等的城市，还有大批城市很快就要解放。在这些城市中和其周围，集中有许多工商业和学校，各个城市之间，有铁路和航运连络着。这种形势，在中国人民和共产党面前提出了把工作重心由农村移到城市的新方针。过去由于城市被强大的敌人所盘据，我们把工作重心放在农村，发动农民进行削弱封建（减租减息）直到消灭封建（分配土地）的斗争，组织军队，用农村来包围城市，然后去夺取城市的政策，事实上证明了是完全正确的。相反，在中国革命历史上存在过的只搞城市忽视农村的观点，事实上证明是完全错误的。但是现在新的形势提出了新时期的任务和工作重心。过去以农村为重心的时期已经结束，开始了由城市到乡村，并由城市来领导乡村的新时期。我们向长江以南进军时，也会是先到城市，然后向农村开展工作。因此我们必须学会管理和建设城市，学会在城市中组织、领导并依靠工人阶级，团结其他劳动人民，争取知识分子，争取小资产阶级和自由资产阶级与我们一道去和帝国主义、国民党、官僚资产阶级作斗争。我们要把城市的文化教育工作恢复，改革和建立起来，使大批学校能为新民主主义社会培养大批有用的人材。城市工作的中心环节，就是恢复和发展生产事业，一切其他工作都应当是围绕着这一中心工作并为它而服务。如果我们进到城市，不去依靠工人阶级，不去以恢复和发展生产事业为其中心的工作，而去依靠贫民或其他阶层，忙于其他的比较不关重要的活动，那一定会要使全盘工作受损失。
    我们说，工作重心现在应该由农村移到城市，应该抽调一定力量来加强城市工作，但如果因此而丢掉乡村，把乡村工作力量都移到城市里来，那也是错误的，也是必须防止和要反对的，必须使城市工作和乡村工作很好的结合起来。中国人口绝大部分是住在农村，他们中有许多工作要做。就是为着要发展工业，也必须使农村能够供给大量的原料，如棉花、大豆、花生、烟叶、麻………，须要农村供给城市大量的粮食。分散的个体农业经济在数量上既然占国民经济的百分之九十，这就说明在今天我们还要依靠农民大量生产粮食和原料。解放区农村的封建势力已被肃清或正在肃清中，农业生产力有发展的充分余地。我们要努力去领导农民提高农业技术，改良水利、种籽、肥料等，来大大提高农产品的生产量。在农村中要去组织大量的农民认为需要的生产的、消费的、供销的合作社，我们要大大提高农业产量，还因为我们要利用它来与外国交换为着恢复和发展工业必需的机器。此外，我们还要在农村中努力做提高农民文化的工作。上述这一连串的农村工作，须要获得城市工人和知识分子的指导和帮助，须要共产党坚强的领导和努力，才有可能把它做得好。
    如上所述，我们虽然接近于全国的胜利——这也还要不骄不躁的认真努力，克服困难才能完成——然而要使中国达到完全的独立自主，则还须我们极为重大而艰苦的努力。一切以为革命快胜利了，可以安闲起来，或者以为已经艰苦奋斗了几十年，已经为人民尽了力、出了汗、流了血，现在可以享受一下了，这些想法应当认为都是不健康的。要知道建设比破坏要艰难得多少倍。一个革命的政党，如果只会破坏旧的，而不会建设新的，如果她不能建设起新的，确实使人民在政治、经济、文化上比以前在旧社会里要过得好一些的生活，那人民会由不满而反对她的，而她终于要走向失败。因此要认识在全国获得胜利之后，还必须以同过去一样的努力，保持那艰苦奋斗、勤俭朴素的作风，要准备节省每一个铜板去为新社会经济的建设而积累一分力量，只有这样再努力十年到十五年，那我们可以说我们的胜利是最终地巩固起来，那时我们有可能和人民一道，过着更加充裕更加文化的生活。
    我们的前面还有如此艰巨的任务，而旧社会交给我们的遗产又是如此贫乏与落后。虽然如此，我们绝不能因此发生任何的悲观。在具有如此勇敢、如此勤劳的四万万几千万人民力量的基础之上，有着中国共产党和中国人民领袖毛泽东的领导；加上苏联和世界各国无产阶级的帮助，我们有根据相信中国的经济建设比苏联十月革命后的发展会要更为迅速的。
    现在的国际形势是：以苏联为首的民主阵线日益强大。苏联及东南欧新民主主义国家的工业经济，都已恢复甚至超过了战前的水平，人民的经济、文化生活也日益改善，全世界民主阵营的力量，显然超过了帝国主义反民主阵营的力量。而以美国帝国主义为首的反民主阵线则日益困难起来。战后称为“强大”的美帝国主义，虽在努力用造成新的战争恐怖的方法，争取尽量推迟其国内经济危机之到来，然而危机的征象已在出现。美国援助蒋介石在中国进行的反共战争遭受失败。中国革命胜利将要完全冲破帝国主义在东方的锁链，东南亚几万万人在中国革命影响下，正在进行着英勇的斗争。美国在欧洲推行的马歇尔计划，把西欧的经济引到了绝路，使受援助的国家对美国的附属性越来越大，因此也遭受各该国人民的越来越大的反对。美国本国因经济大危机的迫近，某些企业开始减缩，工人生活日趋降低，失业恐慌随着增长，人民民主力量也逐渐加强。最近美英又在用北大西洋公约，将来还企图要用什么太平洋公约等办法，来加紧准备战争，加强美国对于受“惠”国的控制，以求逃脱危机。然而全世界人民连美国人民在内，是不愿战争到来的。只要世界工人阶级与一切民主力量保持充分的警惕与努力，战争危机是可以克服的。即使帝国主义者真的挑动了战争，世界人民民主力量也有把握战胜并消灭帝国主义势力。这一切都说明今天的国际环境，是极有利于我们中国革命斗争的顺利发展的。一切过高的去估计帝国主义这个敌人的力量，而过低估计全世界人民力量的看法，是错误的。
    二、加强中国青年运动的领导
    中国青年工人农民和学生，在中国新民主主义革命过程中有着自己很光荣的历史。在五四运动、五卅运动、北伐战争、土地革命、一二九运动、八年抗日战争、抗战以后的民主爱国运动和三年人民解放战争中，中国青年都曾站在英勇斗争的最前列，对人民革命运动作了很光辉的贡献。三十年来的近代革命史，证明中国青年运动是中国革命运动中的一个重要组成部分。斯大林同志曾在一九二六年说：“在中国，青年问题现在是有头等的意义，学生青年（革命的学生）、青年工人、青年农民——一切这些力量，能够推动中国革命向前进展。”毛主席在延安纪念“五四”二十四周年大会上的讲演中说：“五四以来，中国青年们起什么作用呢？起了先锋作用，就是带头作用，就是站在革命队伍的前头。”这些论断，完全合乎中国的实际情况。中国青年其所以能起这种作用的原因，也正如斯大林所分析：“我们应当知道，没有那一个遭受帝国主义压迫是如此的深刻和迫切，也没有那一个感觉需要与这压迫作斗争是如此尖锐和沉痛，如象中国的青年一样。”
    我们现在接近于革命在全国的胜利，但要求我们作最后的努力，我们面前又放着建设新中国的极为严重的历史任务，没有全体人民的动员与努力，这个任务是不能完成的。在动员人民力量的时候，必须着重动员青年的力量，充分发挥广大青年的积极作用。必须根据中国共产党当前总的工作方针，一方面使青年积极参加和支援人民解放军的最后进军——到达长江以南的各地；另一方面使广大青年积极努力参加各方面的建设工作，特别努力参加工业的恢复和发展与提高农业生产，为着加强对于青年运动的领导，中共中央特在今年一月一日通过决议，建立全国统一的青年群众的积极分子组织——中国新民主主义青年团。中共中央发布这一决议，是经过了很慎重的考虑的。为了取得建立青年团的经验，从一九四六年十月起，就已开始在各地试办，这些试办的经验，证明青年团的组织是必要的。我们相信这一决议，各地共产党的党委必定会坚决执行。
    过去青年运动的经验告诉我们，必须要有青年群众自己的积极分子的组织，作为青年群众中领导的核心，才更能有力地推动青年运动的发展。抗日战争初期建立起来的青年救国会——包括几乎全体青年的那种青年组织，虽在抗日运动初期，起了积极作用，但在抗战后期就不能满足青年群众的需要了。现在如果没有比较坚强的青年积极分子的组织作支柱，那么就不易团聚青年的力量，也不能集中表现青年的意志和行动，青年运动就势必陷于涣散无力的境地。
    同时在目前全国革命发展的形势之下，也很迫切地要求有这样一个统一的全国性的包括一切进步青年的积极分子的组织。这一组织的社会基础，应当比过去的共产主义青年团更为广泛。它虽应以工农青年及革命知识分子为主要基础，但又须能够团结全国各阶层中的进步青年，并把其中最好的分子吸收到团内来。在新民主主义青年团中，应当有系统的进行生动实际的马克思列宁主义教育，使每个团员具有坚定的辩证唯物主义的革命人生观，和为人民服务的观点，懂得社会发展的规律，并自觉地按照这种规律而去奋斗。有这种觉悟的新民主主义青年团，必然会成为中国共产党和人民民主政府在最后解决敌人，特别是在建设新民主主义中国的伟大事业中的得力助手。
    保证中国共产党对于中国新民主主义青年团的正确的领导，是中国青年运动正确地向前发展的决定因素。过去三十年来的历史事实，充分说明中国共产党是中国青年最好的领导者和保护者。自从中国共产党诞生以来，历次伟大的青年运动，所以获得光辉的成绩，都是和中国共产党的正确领导分不开的。如果离开中国共产党的领导，或者当中国共产党对于青年运动的领导发生某些偏差时，那么那里的青年运动也就会随之而受到某种程度的损失。
    “保证中国共产党对于青年运动的领导”，是包含着两个意义：一方面，新民主主义青年团领导干部及全体团员必须明确地深刻地认识到接受中国共产党的领导的绝对必要性，坚决执行和服从中国共产党的一切政策决议，学习马克思列宁主义理论和共产党的作风，保证全体团员及广大青年对于中国共产党的完全信任；另一方面，就是要中国共产党各级党委，不放弃或放松自己对于青年运动的领导职责，应该把青年工作放在一个应有的适当位置上，给以必要的关心和帮助。必须深刻认识到加强对于青年运动的领导，是“党在目前革命形势胜利发展下的极重要工作之一”（中共中央关于建立新民主主义青年团的决议）。在加强对青年团领导时，又应当注意尊重青年团在组织上应有的独立性，不要在组织上事事去干涉青年团。
    青年团的基本任务是要团结和教育整个青年一代，其工作阵地，显然不应当限于青年学生的狭小范围内，相反，是要把更多的注意放在开展工农劳动青年中的工作上，而且主要地是要依靠工农劳动青年群众。在已经掌握了大城市的今天，正当共产党的工作重心由农村转移到城市的现时，需要特别加强青年工人群众中的工作，并要特别注意在青年工人、学徒中发展团员，要求每个重大企业或每条铁路上，每个矿山中，都有青年团的组织，使青年团组织中青年工人成份的比重增加。在不放松农村青年工作的原则下，把青年工作的主要阵地放到城市各企业的青工工作中去。
    青年团在青年工人中开展工作的主要目的，在于提高青年工人的生产积极性，并作为遵守劳动纪律节省生产原料的模范者。在学习技术和手艺中，在生产竞赛运动中，要能起先锋带头作用。青年工人团员应成为参加工会的积极分子。工厂中的青年团，除接受党的支部领导之外，必须和职工会保持正确关系，在组织上，青年团和职工会都是受共产党领导的、但是青年团在青年工人中应进行工作，使青年工人自觉自动地遵守和响应各公营企业工厂或职工会的各项规定和号召。而职工会在确定有关青年工作的问题时，应当征询和尊重青年团的意见。同级职工会的青工部部长或副部长，最好是由青年团的工作人员来担任。
    在农村中青年团应当继续有重点的去发展团的组织，吸收雇农、贫农、中农中优秀分子入团。新富农及农村知识分子中的进步觉悟分子，也可吸收一部分入团，但必须保障团的领导成份主要是放在雇农、贫农出身的青年身上。在实行过去土地改革地区的农村青年团员，应成为增加农业生产（包括副业）的积极分子，领导广大青年农民与成年农民一道变工合作，进行深耕细作，改良水利、多种粮食、多产棉花和其他为发展工业所必需的农产品，并且积极参加农村中的合作社运动。在新解放区，则应按照共产党新区工作的方针进行青年工作，准备由减租进到分配土地，同时要不使生产低落。
    在军队中建团是一个极重要的工作，其方针与步骤，可按照朱总司令在开幕时的致词中所指示者执行。
    中国学生运动有很光荣的历史传统。学生青年容易接收进步思想，他们又有知识，希望他们在学习中注意把自己培养成为建设新民主主义国家的有用人材，因此今后还要加强学生中的工作。在各大学、中学和专门学校中，要有步骤、有计划地去建立团的组织，开展团的工作，学生中的青年团员，应当成为学习的模范，特别努力学习于建设新社会有益的科学，同时应该积极参加学生会的各种工作，依靠自己优良的学业和模范的实际行动，去取得同学们的信任，使学校中团的组织真正成为团聚优秀学生，而且为一般学生所拥护的组织。
    为着发展工业和农业，政府将要开办大批培养工业和农业以及医药卫生方面的干部学校和训练班，城市和农村中的青年团，有任务要供给大批优秀团员和青年工人，农民及革命学生知识分子进到这些学校和训练班里学习，以便训练出大批新民主主义国家的建设人材——工业、农业的专门家、工程师、技师及能管理工厂、农场的干部等。
    青年团要在各种不同职业，不同工作部门的青年群众中进行工作，其总的目标，在于团结和教育青年一代，在于领导青年学习建设新民主主义中国的各种理论与实际。因此，学习问题，是所有一切不同职业，不同部门的青年团的共同的中心活动。学习的含义有两方面：一方面，学习系统的马克思、列宁主义与中国革命实践相结合的毛泽东思想，学习科学、技术知识，提高青年团员及广大青年的思想政治文化水平。另一方面学习马克思列宁主义在各种具体工作上的实际运用。这就是说，学习要和本身的实际工作结合起来，在工厂中的青年团员，要努力使自己成为工厂中的熟练的模范工人；在农村中的青年团员，要努力使自己成为农村中的有知识的模范农民；在部队中的青年团员，要努力使自己成为有文化的模范战士或战斗英雄；在学校的青年团员，要努力使自己成为学校中有思想的模范学生；在各种不同工作岗位上的青年团员，要努力使自己成为本工作岗位上的模范工作者。总结起来说，青年团的基本任务，是要领导并鼓舞全体青年团员及广大青年在各种不同的实际工作中进行不断地学习，不断的进步，以便能使中国新民主主义的革命事业，培养出千千万万有高度政治觉悟又有坚强的实际工作能力的优秀的革命后备军，源源不断地补充到各种工作岗位去，推动革命事业前进，建设起确实比旧社会不知道要好多少倍的新民主主义社会，并且准备将来进入社会主义的社会。
    青年团的工作在过去的历史上曾经有过偏向的。为着今后青年团工作及青年运动能够顺利地发展，对于青年运动中几个历史上的偏向问题，必须有正确的恰当的看法，以免许多同志不能勇敢放手地去建立青年团的组织，而障碍青年运动的发展。对于过去共产主义青年团和青年救国会时期的青年工作，应当估计为在基本上是成功的，有成绩的。一九二○年成立的中国社会主义青年团（中国共产主义青年团的前身），是先于中国共产党而诞生的，它对建党工作在某种意义上是起了思想上和组织上的准备作用，从一九二○年直至一九二七年的大革命时期，青年团在中国人民中特别是青年学生和知识分子中，有相当大的影响，恽代英、萧楚女等同志负责编辑的“中国青年”周刊，在中国学生知识界和各大城市的一部分青年工人中，发生了很大的影响，特别在介绍共产主义思想，在与反动的国家主义派（即现在的青年党）作思想斗争中起过重大作用。在各种反帝国主义反军阀运动和北伐战争中，以及在广东和湖南湖北的农民运动中，青年团员也都是积极的参加者。但由于青年团先于党产生的影响，以及在大革命末期，青年团在反陈独秀机会主义斗争中产生出的对党不够尊重，形成了青年团的先锋主义的第二党的偏向。后来在土地革命时期中，这种偏向在左倾错误路线领导之下曾有过某种程度上的发展。但就是在这个时期中，青年团在分配土地、查田运动、建立政权、组织少年先锋队和儿童团，动员青年参军、发展教育、以及在军队中，仍然是进行了很多有益的工作。在“一二九”运动中产生的中华民族解放先锋队，不仅在当时的学生运动中起了骨干作用，而且抗战以后大批民先队员走上抗日前线，在坚持敌后斗争，开辟抗日根据地的工作上面，也起了不小的作用。此外在抗战初期的武汉青年救国团、广东青年抗日先锋队以及各解放区青年救国会的活动，大批青年学生、青年工人的下乡工作，也都是轰轰烈烈地发展着，有过优良的成绩。以后有些地方的青年组织，因不善于使青年运动与整个党所领导的人民运动相结合，过分地强调了青年的特殊性，因而产生一种单独去搞青年自己一套的闹独立性的偏向，这是错误的，但是这种偏向为时不久就受到了纠正。
    这就是过去共产主义青年团时代（大革命和土地革命时期）和青年救国会时代（抗日时期）大略的实际情况。从这里面可以看出：不管是共产主义青年团或是抗日时期的青年组织，都是做了很多有益革命的工作，如果不估计到这点，那是不对的。我们承认在过去共产主义青年团及青年救国会时期的青年运动中，曾经发生过“先锋主义”及“闹独立性”的错误偏向，我们吸取这些教训，并防止在今后的青年运动中重犯这类错误，这是十分必要的，但如果只看到这一方面，而且片面的夸大过去青年运动中产生过的错误偏向，因而否定过去青年运动的重大成就，那就必然会做出不合乎历史事实的错误结论，且将造成一种错觉：似乎再没有建立任何青年团的必要了，似乎建立新民主主义青年团也没有什么好处，这类思想如不加以澄清，则将成为创建新民主主义青年团的重大障碍。
    青年人热忱有朝气，容易吸收新的思想和作风，把他们中间的积极分子组织起来，再经过这些积极分子去教育组织团结广大的中间分子，并提高一部分较为落后的分子，使他们积极参加各种活动，参加解放军和支援战争，参加工业、农业生产，所有这一切都会大大的增加我们的力量。目前的重要问题，根本不是惧怕青年先锋主义和闹独立性的问题，因为青年团还没有广泛的建立起来。现在的问题是要放手一些，让做青年工作的干部大胆地去进行建团的工作，共产党和人民政府多多加以指导和帮助。在现在中国共产党有着这样强大而普遍的组织，有着正确的政治路线和自己的领袖；而青年运动本身也有了丰富的经验，有了犯“先锋主义”“闹独立性”（应称为青年主义倾向更为恰当，以免与青年组织在组织上应有独立性混淆）偏向的历史教训，应当是比较不容易重犯过去的错误的。自然对这些历史错误偏向，应当时常警惕，当他出现的时候，则须适当地加以纠正，使青年运动走向正确的轨道。但绝不应因为怕重复错误，就连青年团的组织也不去建立了，如果是这样，那就要犯错误。同时，应当把青年带头当先锋与“先锋主义”加以区别。带头作用，打先锋，不仅是可以的，而且要去提倡，但不要走到先锋主义。先锋主义是不顾共产党的领导，而企图去代替党的领导，这种偏向我们应当反对。对于青年组织应有的独立性与“闹独立性”的偏向（青年主义偏向），也应加以清楚的区别。闹独立性的偏向应加以反对，但同时应当注意尊重青年组织在组织上应有的独立性。我们必需正确地认识和解决这些问题，才能建立对于青年团的正确领导，才能使青年运动按照伟大的中国人民民主事业的需要正确地迅速地前进。
    当此中国反帝、反封建、反官僚资本主义革命快要在全中国取得完全胜利的时候建立起中国新民主主义青年团是具有极为重要的历史意义的。中国共产党中央和毛主席，对于这件事是十分关心和重视，全中国的青年们也都在集中注视这次新民主主义青年团成立大会的经过与结果。我们相信在这次大会以后，全国青年运动会有一个很大的发展，青年积极性也会因此而更为提高，使我们最后取得全国胜利的斗争，特别是在建设新民主主义中国的长期建设事业中会获得从青年方面所来的更大力量的帮助。这是中国共产党所衷心希望的。谨代表中国共产党中央委员会祝贺新民主主义青年团第一次全国代表大会的成功！（附图片）
