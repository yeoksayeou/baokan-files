    Warriors in the Rain
    By Ke Ren
    ① Requests and resolutions from the People's Liberation Army to go south poured in like snowflakes.
    ② A soldier's father called him home to get married, but the soldier said, "I'll go home to get married after all of China is liberated."
    ③ All the soldiers are ready to depart.
    ④ Railway workers assured the southward-bound army, "Wherever you fight, we will build the road there."
    ⑤ From factories to rural areas, a surge of production enthusiasm was set off, and they sang, "As the People's Liberation Army advances, our production grows an inch!"
    ⑥ The people enthusiastically bid farewell to their own soldiers, and everyone had one hope: to quickly liberate the brothers in Jiangnan.
