[Taihang Dispatch] The Heshun County Government recently established livestock breeding stations in four locations: Chengnanguan, Dachuankou, Songyan, and Shangbeishe, and issued loans to support and promote breeding work throughout the county. Currently, the four stations have purchased four male donkeys and three stallions for planned breeding. On the 18th of last month, the county government also convened a meeting of heads of breeding stations. The meeting first criticized the past thinking of underestimating livestock breeders and established the correct view of breeding livestock to serve production and construction. Then, experiences in breeding and raising livestock were exchanged. As the saying goes, "March for calves, April for horses, May for donkey foals is a bad time to hit them." Therefore, it is best to breed donkeys and mules in April and May. Mating should be done on a clear, bright day, so that the donkeys and mules born will have shiny fur and grow tall and strong. Female animals "come into heat" once a month, but the duration varies, some for three or four days, some for five or six days. Young animals should be mated later, and old animals should be mated earlier, so that the female animal is more likely to conceive. If the female animal is obese, it should be made to overwork before mating to make it easier to conceive. When breeding mules with donkeys, the female animal must be tall. Black donkeys give birth to gray donkey foals, so that after transgenerational breeding, mules can be bred. As the saying goes, "A mule born from a horse is like planting onions in mud, a mule born from a donkey is like panning gold in sand," so this should be paid special attention. In addition, do not drink water before mating, and after mating, you must walk around for a while before feeding. Do not mate immediately after crossing a cold river. Do not feed wheat bran to male animals during mating, and depending on the amount of mating, administer one to three doses of Xiaohuang San medicine each month. The meeting also divided the breeding areas for each station and unified the breeding prices. According to the government's labor service regulations, breeding livestock is exempt from labor service, and those who raise breeding livestock are exempt from service during the breeding period. Finally, each station formulated this year's breeding plan.

　　推动全县牲畜繁殖
  　和顺设种畜站
  　各站负责人交流经验
    【太行电】和顺县府近在城南关、大川口、松烟、上北舍四地建立牲畜配种站，并发放贷款，以扶植推进全县配种工作。现在四个站已买到公驴四头，公马三匹，有计划的配种。上月十八日县府并召开种畜站负责人会议，首先批判了过去轻视养种畜人的思想，树立了繁殖牲畜，为生产建设服务的正确观点。接着交流了配种与饲养牲畜经验。俗话说：“三月牛犊四月马，五月驴驹不敢打。”所以配种驴骡最好在四五月。交配时应择晴亮的好天，这样生下的驴骡皮毛光亮，发育高大。母畜每月“性发”一次，但时间长短不等，有三四天的，有五六天的；小牲口交配应晚些，老牲口要交配得早些，这样母畜容易受胎。如母畜肥胖，要在交配前使之过度劳动，才易受胎。驴配骡的必须是母畜高大，黑驴生下灰驴驹，这样转胎后才能配骡。正如俗话所说，“马下骡是泥里栽葱，驴下骡是沙里澄金”这应十分注意。此外，交配前不要饮水，交配后必须遛一阵再喂。过了冷水河不可马上交配。公畜交配时不可喂麦麸，并看交配多少，每月灌一付至三付消黄散药。会议并划分了各站配种地区和统一规定了配种价格。依据政府支差条例，规定种畜不支差、养种畜的人在种畜交配期间不服勤务。最后，各站订出了今年的配种计划。
