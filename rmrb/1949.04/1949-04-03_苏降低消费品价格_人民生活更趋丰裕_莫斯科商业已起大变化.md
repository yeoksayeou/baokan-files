　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 2nd: Moscow dispatch: Since the Soviet state-owned retail trade reduced consumer goods prices, Moscow's commerce has undergone considerable changes in the past month. Due to the people's greatly increased need for industrial products, especially clothing and silk fabrics, many new state-owned stores have opened in March alone. Collective farm transactions in the market have greatly expanded. Collective farmers are bringing more agricultural products to the Moscow market. In March, many collective farms reduced their goods prices by 30 to 40 percent. Many foods have implemented newly set spring prices from April 1st. For example, the price of milk has been reduced by 25 percent, canned cheese by more than 20 percent, and eggs by 25 percent.

  　莫斯科商业已起大变化
    【新华社北平二日电】莫斯科讯：苏联国营零售贸易减低消费品价格后，一个月来，莫斯科的商业已起了相当大的变化。由于人民对于工业品、特别是衣服和丝织品的需要大大增加，三月份一个月内，又有许多新的国营商店开业。集体农场在市场上的交易大大扩充了。集体农民们把更多的农产品带到莫斯科市场。三月份许多集体农场把他们的货物价格减低了百分之三十到四十。许多食品从四月一日起实行新订的春季价格。例如，牛奶的价格减低了百分之二十五，罐装干酪减低了百分之二十以上，鸡蛋减低了百分之二十五。
