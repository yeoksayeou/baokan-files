　　Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, 2nd. The symbols of the U.S. economic crisis are becoming increasingly evident. The sharp decline in agricultural product prices, which began on February 4th, has just shown signs of recovery, and now price reductions in durable industrial goods and consumer goods are following closely. According to a United Press report on the 29th, the items experiencing price drops include steel, which has been consistently strong due to the expansion of armaments, as well as automobiles, radios, refrigerators, stoves, batteries, roasting utensils, men's shirts, blankets, and beer. The largest price reduction is for cars from the Kaiser-Frazer Corporation, where their cheap cars have dropped by $330 per vehicle due to lack of demand. Trucks, radios, electric refrigerators, etc., had already experienced production cuts in the third quarter of last year due to overproduction relative to demand, but still could not escape the fate of price reductions. Even Eccles, a senior official of the U.S. Federal Reserve, has been forced to acknowledge the further decline in the purchasing power of the American people.

　　美国经济危机的象征，益加明显。
  　钢和汽车也都跌价了
    【新华社北平二日电】美国经济危机的象征，益加明显。二月四日开始的农产品价格剧烈跌价甫告回涨，耐用工业品及消费品跌价又接踵而至。据合众社二十九日透露：跌价物品中包括由于扩充军备而一向挺俏的钢，此外则有汽车、收音机、冰箱、汽炉、电池、烙烤用具、男衬衣、毛毯以及啤酒。凡撒·福莱塞汽车公司的汽车跌价最大，该公司的廉价汽车已因无人购买，每辆一下子跌了三百三十元。卡车、收音机、电汽冰箱等，早在去年第三季就已因生产超过需求而实行减产，但仍不能逃过跌价的命运，美国人民购买力的进一步降低，就连美国联邦准备局的高级干部艾克尔斯也已不得不承认。
