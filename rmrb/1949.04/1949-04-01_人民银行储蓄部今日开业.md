　　People's Bank Savings Department Opens Today

　　[This newspaper reported] The Savings Department of the Beijing Branch of the People's Bank of China is now ready and will open today (the 1st) at 9:00 AM. The department will initially handle real value savings deposits and agency collection and payment services. Real value savings uses the price of one "jin" of wheat flour, one "jin" of corn flour, and one "chi" of Five Blessings Cloth as a standard real unit, which will be posted daily. When depositors deposit funds, the amount will be converted into units according to the posted price and credited to the account, and interest will be calculated at the prescribed interest rate. When withdrawing at maturity, it will be converted back into cash according to the then-current price, so that the deposit will not be affected by price fluctuations. The interest on savings is also calculated based on real units. For example, with a one-year term and a monthly interest rate of 0.8%, calculated in real terms: depositing 100 bags of flour will yield approximately 9 bags of interest per year.

　　[This newspaper reported] To facilitate all sectors, the Beijing Branch of the People's Bank of China has decided to start handling telephone remittances between Beijing and Tianjin today (the 1st). (Yu)
