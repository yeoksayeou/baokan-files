　　We realize that implementing this suggestion may be difficult and not easy to achieve, but we believe that Mr. Shen's spirit of active suggestion is very good. We are publishing it specifically to stimulate discussion.

　　The People's Bank of Peiping's Savings Regulation No. 1, as reported on March 29th, is a type of savings that is difficult to find in capitalist countries or feudal societies. Indexed savings not only promote thrift and reduce waste, but also allow depositors to avoid the impact of price fluctuations and other unexpected events. This type of savings is most suitable for public employees, freelancers, laborers, and technicians. The four methods stipulated by the bank are also very thorough. However, regarding item C—lump-sum withdrawal of regular deposits—I have the following suggestions. Regarding this item, the People's Bank's regulations state: "This type of deposit is a fixed-term savings deposit where deposits are made in installments and withdrawn in one lump sum. The terms are divided into half a year and one year, and the deposit periods are divided into once every half month, once every month, once every two months, and once every three months, chosen by the depositor. Regarding the amount, each deposit must be a fixed unit, with one unit as the minimum and no limit to the maximum. The amount is determined by the depositor when opening the account. Once the amount is determined, it cannot be changed." Regarding the deposit period, I believe that after the depositor has chosen one (such as depositing once a month), if the depositor wishes to deposit again within this period (thirty days), the bank may allow them to deposit two or more times, which is more convenient. This is because many freelancers and laborers have uncertain salaries. Regarding the clause "Once the amount is determined, it cannot be changed," I think it is better to allow changes (but the minimum is a fixed unit). Some people may be able to save ten units this month, but may reduce or increase it next month, because they cannot be sure whether temporary events will occur. Having certain restrictions will make them feel inconvenient. If the above two restrictions are broken, everyone can deposit at any time. Although it will be more troublesome for the bank to calculate interest, it will be very good for the masses.

　　对人民银行折实储蓄的一点意见
    北大  沈建民
    这个意见实行起来也许有困难，不易做到，但我们认为沈先生这种积极建议的精神是很好的。特刊出，希望引起讨论。
    ——编者
    三月二十九日报载北平人民银行储字第一号办法，此种储蓄在资本主义国家，在封建社会，都是难以找见的。折实储蓄不但能促进节约，减少浪费，且可使存户避免物价波动及其他意外事件的影响。此种储蓄对公教人员、自由职业者、劳动者、技术人员最为合适。银行所规定之四种办法，也是很周密的。但关于其中之丙项，——零存整付，我有以下意见。关于此项，人民银行之规定为“此项存款系零星存入一次提取的定期储蓄存款，期限分为半年、一年两种、其存交期次分为每半月一次、每一月一次、每两月一次、每三月一次四种，由存户自择。关于额数，每次存入固定之单位数以一单位起码，多者不限。由存户开户时自行规定。额数一经确定，不得变更。”对存交期次，我以为存户在择定一种（如每月存交一次）后，在此期限（三十日）内，如存户愿意再存时，银行可以许可其存入二次或若干次，这样更方便。因为有好些自由职业者、劳动者，他们所得的薪给是不定的。对于“额数一经确定不得变更”一节，我认为许可变更好（但最少是一固定单位），有的人这月可储十单位，下月也许降低或升高，因为他断定不了是否发生临时事情。有一定限制，他会感到不方便。如果以上两种限制打破，大家便随时可以存款。在银行计算利息时虽多些麻烦，但对人民大众却很好。
