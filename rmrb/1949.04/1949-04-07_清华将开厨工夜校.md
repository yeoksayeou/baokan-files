　　School Life

　　▲ Tsinghua University's kitchen staff night school discussed class assignments on the 5th, with 27 second-year students from the Electrical Engineering Department serving as instructors. Recently, donations were solicited for this purpose, resulting in the donation of many notebooks, pencils, and cash. Classes are scheduled to begin soon.
    ▲ In order to provide educational opportunities for out-of-school children in the nearby rural areas and to give students the opportunity to serve the countryside, the New Youth League's Children's Department and the old literacy class at Tsinghua University have decided to resume teaching activities in the Xiliu Village and Lanqi areas. Currently, over 200 children in these two areas have registered to participate.

　　清华将开厨工夜校
    ▲清华大学厨工夜校五日讨论分班上课问题，由电机系二年级二十七位同学担任教课。最近曾为此募损，捐到很多本子、铅笔和现款，准备于近日开课。
    ▲清华为使附近农村失学儿童得到教育，并使同学有服务农村的机会，校新青团少年儿童部和旧识字班合作，决定先恢复西柳村和蓝旗两区的教学工作，现该两区已有二百多儿童报名参加。
