　　[JiZhong News] Yuan Shucai and others in Nanhe Village, Second District of Anxin, have achieved success in raising breeding livestock and mating. The county government is planning to support them and expand the establishment of a mating station. The Yuan Shucai and Yuan Laofu families have been raising breeding livestock for two or three generations and have a lot of experience in mating livestock. Yuan Shucai raises a breeding donkey and a breeding horse; Yuan Laofu raises a breeding donkey. Villages from very far away drive to mate, and even those from Xiongxian, Rongcheng and other counties come. From the beginning of this year to the end of February, the three breeding livestock mated with more than 180 female livestock in total, and every day people bring female livestock to mate.
    The masses in the village also pay attention to breeding livestock. Yuan Dasheng's father also wants to buy a breeding cow, and Yuan Shucai and others also want to add a breeding horse. The county cooperative is also preparing to provide loans to support them, and plans to set up a mating station in Nanhe Village to breed livestock in large quantities. (Li Pu)
    [Taiyue Telegram] In order to solve the difficulties of medical treatment for livestock epidemic diseases for organizations, groups and people in various places, the Taiyue Administrative Office has specially established a livestock epidemic prevention team in Nanguan, Yangcheng, which includes one Western medicine doctor, two traditional Chinese medicine doctors, and trainees. The team has recently purchased a large number of effective drugs and instruments for treating livestock from Luoyang and other places, and officially started work on April 1st, providing free treatment for sick livestock. In recent days, people from Yangcheng Chengguan and nearby villages, as well as Qingshui and other places, have led thirteen livestock to come for treatment. According to the doctors, most of the current livestock diseases are due to dampness in the pens and diseases of the hooves and legs. In the future, it is necessary to promote hygiene in the pens.

　　依托养种畜村庄
  　安新将设交配站
  　太岳组家畜防疫队
    【冀中讯】安新二区南河村袁书材等养种畜，交配有成绩，县府正计划予以扶植，扩大设立交配站。按袁书材袁老副两家，养种畜已有两三辈了，对交配牲畜上很有经验。袁书材养着种驴一头种马一头；袁老副养种驴一头，周围很远的村庄都赶去交配，甚至雄县、容城等县也有来的。自今年开春到二月底，三头种畜共交配母畜一百八十多头，每天都有带母畜去交配的。
    该村群众对繁殖牲口也很注意，袁大生父亲也想买一种牛，袁书材他们还想增添一匹种马。县社亦准备贷款给予扶植，计划在南河村设一交配站，大量繁殖牲畜。（李璞）
    【太岳电】太岳行政公署为了解决机关团体及各地群众医治家畜疫病的困难，特在阳城南关设立家畜防疫队，内有西医一人、中医二人，并有练习生。该队新从洛阳等地购回大批有效的治疗家畜的药品和仪器，已于四月一日正式工作，免费治疗病畜。近几天来，已有阳城城关及附近各村与沁水等地群众，牵着十三头牲口前来治疗。据医生们谈：现在畜病大多是圈内潮湿，蹄腿等病，今后需提倡圈内卫生。
