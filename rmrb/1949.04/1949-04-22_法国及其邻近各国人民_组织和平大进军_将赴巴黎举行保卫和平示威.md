Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 20th: Reports from various sources indicate that the World Congress of Supporters of Peace, an unprecedented grand review of the forces of the world peace camp, is scheduled to open in Paris today. People's organizations from all over France, as the host country of the congress, are actively assisting the congress's organizing committee in its work. People from many cities in France and neighboring countries are organizing peace march brigades, scheduled to arrive at the Brogniart stadium in Paris on April 24 to participate in a large demonstration to defend peace. Trade unions and people's organizations in towns and cities along the route in France are preparing reception stations for the peace march brigades. Peace Week has also begun throughout France.

Delegations from many countries are arriving in Paris one after another. Of the Soviet delegation, six members had already arrived in Paris in advance. The remaining six, including Academician Volgin and writer Ehrenburg, arrived in Paris on the 18th. Delegations from Bulgaria, Poland, Cuba, Haiti and other countries have also arrived. Delegations from Britain, the United States, and other countries will arrive soon. The Italian delegation, with nearly 700 members, arrived in Paris by special train on the 19th. When this impressive delegation drove past the US Embassy, the streets were packed with welcoming crowds. Although the entry visa restrictions between France and Italy were lifted not long ago, three prominent members of the Italian delegation were unreasonably prevented from entering the country. These three are Longo, former leader of the famous Italian guerrillas and Deputy Secretary-General of the Italian Communist Party, Senator Pastore, and Massini, a member of the Secretariat of the General Confederation of Labor and a member of the Central Committee of the Italian Communist Party.

The head of the Cuban delegation, Maribaldo, from Cuba, a small Central American country under US oppression, told a reporter from L'Humanité that they were restricted from contact with the outside world while transiting through the United States. He said that the peace movement in Cuba is now quite strong. When they left Havana, thousands of people went to the pier to see them off. All democratic groups in Cuba actively participated in the preparations for the conference.

Various cities in Romania held meetings on the 18th to express the determination of the Romanian people to fight for peace and to celebrate the upcoming peace conference. The Italian Committee for the Defense of Peace and Opposition to the Atlantic Pact was recently established in Rome. The committee issued a statement demanding that the Italian Parliament make the following guarantees to the people: not to grant Italy's military bases to foreign countries, not to allow foreign armed forces to land in Italy, and not to allow foreign influence on Italy's domestic policies.

In addition to persecuting its own representatives and instigating its French lackeys to restrict representatives from other countries, American imperialists are shamelessly trying to sabotage the peace conference. According to a report from Agence Telegraphique Parisienne, the US Embassy in France requested the French government to install microphones in the hotel rooms of the peace conference delegates in order for the State Department and the Federal Bureau of Investigation to eavesdrop on private conversations. However, the reactionary French government, in view of the strong protests at home and abroad against its restrictions on representatives from various countries, did not dare to comply with its master's demands on this issue. The report also stated that the French government once intended to stop restricting the measures against representatives of various countries, but it was also prevented by the United States.

　　法国及其邻近各国人民
    组织和平大进军
  　将赴巴黎举行保卫和平示威
    【新华社北平二十日电】各方报导：全世界和平阵营力量空前大检阅的世界拥护和平大会，定于今日在巴黎揭幕。作为大会东道主的全法各地人民团体，正在积极地帮助大会筹委会的工作。法国及其邻近各国许多城市中的人民，正在组织和平进军大队，并定于四月二十四日到达巴黎布洛法运动场，参加保卫和平的大示威，法国沿途各城镇的工会及人民团体正为和平进军大队准备招待站。全法各地的和平周亦已开始。
    许多国家的代表团正陆续到达巴黎。苏联代表团除六人已先期到达巴黎外，其余六人包括科学院会员沃尔金，作家艾伦堡等六人已于十八日抵巴黎。保、波、古巴、海地等国代表亦已到达。英美等国代表团不久即将到达。拥有团员近七百人的意大利代表团，已于十九日乘专车抵巴黎。当这一阵容雄壮的代表团乘车驰往美大使馆门前时，街道上挤满了欢迎的群众。虽然法意间的入境签证限制已于不久前取消，但意大利代表团，仍有著名团员三人被无理阻止，不能入境。这三人是意前著名游击队领袖、意共副总书记隆哥，上议员巴斯托和总工会书记处委员意共中委马西尼。
    美国压迫下的中美小国古巴代表团团长马里巴洛告人道报记者说：他们途经美国时，被限制不得与外界接触。他说：古巴的和平运动现在颇为强大。当他们离开哈瓦那时，成千的人到码头欢送他们。古巴一切民主团体积极参加了大会的筹备工作。
    罗马尼亚各城市都在十八日举行大会，表示罗国人民愿为和平进行奋斗的决心，并庆祝即将开幕的和平大会。意大利保卫和平与反对大西洋公约委员会，已经于最近在罗马成立，委员会发表声明，要求意议会对人民作下述保证，不以意大利的军事基地给予外国，不允许外国武装部队在意大利登陆，不容许外国影响意大利的内政政策。
    美国帝国主义者除了迫害其本国代表，嗾使其法走卒限制其他各国代表外，正卑鄙地竭力破坏和平大会。据电通社巴黎讯：美驻法大使馆曾要求法政府在和平大会代表所住的旅馆房间中设置微音器，为国务院和联邦调查局窃录私人谈话。但法国反动政府鉴于它限制各国代表的措施已在国内外引起了强大的抗议声浪。并未敢在此问题上答应其主子的要求。该电又称：法国政府曾一度意图停止限制各国代表的措施，但亦为美国所阻止。
