Analyzing Mirror
　　Wang Zhong

　　When you walk into the finishing room of the Daking Cotton Mill Cloth Factory in Shijiazhuang, you will see the cloth inspectors using a small, one-inch square mirror to check the quality of the cloth. This small mirror is called an "analyzing mirror."

　　Before liberation, this little thing never played a good role, and the weavers all hated it. At that time, it would repeatedly "analyze" the cloth you wove under the eyes of the inspectors. If you weren't good at flattering, a single "analysis" could "analyze" problems. Getting fined was a small matter; if things weren't right, it could "analyze" away your job.

　　Now, the small mirrors used in the factory are bought by the workers themselves. One day, worker Li Wushen returned from the street and said to the administration, "I saw an 'analyzing mirror' in the Garden Market. Our factory really needs this. Buy it quickly!" The administration sent worker Wang Baoquan to buy it for 100,000 border currency. Now, this little "analyzing mirror" is what the workers love to use the most. This is because it helps the workers improve the quality of the cloth!

　　The workers often say, "In the past, we wove cloth to be sold for the capitalists. Now we weave cloth for the people to wear. We must weave the cloth well to be worthy of the people." Indeed, the quality of "Mountain Deer" cloth has improved unprecedentedly.

　　The "analyzing mirror" is still helping workers in the finishing room every day to further improve the quality of the cloth.

　　分析镜
    王中
    当你走进石家庄大兴纱厂布厂整理间去，你会看见验布的工人，用一枚一寸见方的小镜子，在检查布的质量。这小镜子，叫“分析镜”。
    这小东西在解放前，从没有起过好作用，织布的工人都恨它。那时，他在验布人员的眼睛底下，反来复去的“分析”你织的布，如果你不大会拍马屁，一“分析”可就许“分析”出岔子来，挨罚是小事，不对劲儿就许把饭碗“分析”掉。
    现在厂内用的小镜子，却是工人自动买来的，有一天，工人李戊申从街上回来，找到行政上说：“我在花园市场上看到一枚‘分析镜’，咱厂正缺这个，快把它买来吧！”行政上就派工人汪保全，花了边币十万块钱把它买来了。现在这个小小的“分析镜”是工人最爱用它的了。这是因为它帮助工人们提高了布的质量！
    工人们常说：“从前是给资本家织卖的布，现在是为老百姓织穿的布，必须把布织的好好的，才对得住老百姓”。的确，“山鹿”布的质量是空前提高了。
    “分析镜”每天仍然在整理间帮助工人更进一步来提高布的质量。
