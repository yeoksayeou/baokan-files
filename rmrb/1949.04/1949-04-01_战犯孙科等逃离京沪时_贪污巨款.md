Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 30th:

　　Various sources report that several major embezzlement cases have recently been exposed within the Kuomintang reactionary government, with Sun Ke and Chen Lifu as the main culprits in these cases. During his tenure as the puppet Executive Yuan President, Sun Ke privately withdrew 110 million yuan in puppet gold yuan from the "Central Bank" on February 10 under the guise of "confidential expenses," for the use of himself, his son Sun Zhiping, and his concubine Lan Ni. Furthermore, when the puppet Executive Yuan was moved to Guangzhou, he instructed the "Central Bank" to purchase his house in Shanghai at the exorbitant price of 600,000 Hong Kong dollars. Sun Ke also, during the Japanese surrender, gave 650,000 US dollars of public funds from the Kuomintang reactionary government to his concubine Lan Ni, ostensibly as compensation for a large batch of pigments confiscated by the Kuomintang authorities as enemy and puppet property. This so-called "Pigment Case" has also recently attracted public attention. When Chen Lifu fled Nanjing, he adopted the same method as Sun Ke, having the "Central Bank" purchase his property in Shanghai at a high price. In addition, the major embezzlement activities of Bai Yunti, Chairman of the puppet Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, Liu Weichi, the puppet Minister of Industry and Commerce, and Zhao Shen, the puppet Minister of Judicial Administration, have also been exposed. Bai Yunti privately took away the "relocation expenses" of thousands of employees and workers when he fled Nanjing. Sun Ke's embezzlement case has caused an uproar within the Kuomintang government. The puppet Control Yuan filed an "impeachment" against Sun Ke after his resignation, but has remained silent on other embezzlement cases.

　　战犯孙科等逃离京沪时
  　贪污巨款
    【新华社北平三十日电】各方消息，国民党反动政府中最近接连暴露几项大贪污事件，孙科、陈立夫等人是这些贪污案的主角。孙科在伪行政院长任内曾于二月十日以“机密费”名义私自向“中央银行”支领伪金圆券一亿一千万元，供他本人和他的儿子孙治平、他的姘妇蓝妮使用；并在将伪行政院搬往广州时，要“中央银行”以六十万的港币高价收买了他在上海的房屋。孙科还曾在日本投降时，以国民党反动政府公款六十五万美元交给他的姘妇蓝妮，名义上是赔偿她被国民党当局当作敌伪财产没收的一大批颜料。这件所谓“颜料案”也于最近引起社会舆论的注意。陈立夫逃离南京时，也采取孙科同样的办法，让“中央银行”以高价收买了他在上海的房产。此外，伪蒙藏委员会委员长白云梯、伪工商部长刘维炽、伪司法行政部长赵深等人的大贪污行为也已暴露。白云梯逃离南京时曾将数千职员和工人的“迁移费”私自携走。孙科的贪污案已在国民政府内部喧嚷开来。伪监察院于孙科辞职以后对孙科提出“纠举”，但对其他贪污案尚未作声。
