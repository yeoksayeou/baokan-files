Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 17th: According to an Agence France-Presse dispatch from Tokyo: The All-Japan Trade Union Liaison Committee, with over four million members, issued a lengthy statement on the 13th, outlining the circumstances of MacArthur Headquarters' refusal of the Japanese trade union representatives' application to attend the Tenth Congress of All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions. The statement pointed out that the Japanese trade union representatives were elected in a democratic manner. The statement announced that the committee would submit its application to MacArthur again.

According to a report by a Dentsu News Agency Tokyo reporter, officials from the MacArthur Headquarters Labor Section have ordered Japanese trade unions not to take political action against anti-labor laws. This bill, modeled after the American Taft-Hartley anti-labor law, will soon be submitted for discussion in the Japanese parliament. However, the Japan Federation of Industrial Labor Organizations reiterated its opposition to any anti-labor law policies.

  　抗议美帝反动措施
    斥责干涉出席苏职工代表会重申反对任何反劳工法政策
    【新华社北平十七日电】据法新社东京讯：拥有四百余万会员的全日职工组合联络委员会于十三日发表长篇声明，说明麦克阿瑟总部拒绝日职工会代表申请参加全苏职工会第十届代表大会的情形。声明指出，日本职工会的代表是用民主方式选出来的。声明宣布该委员会将再向麦克阿瑟提出其申请。
    据电通社东京记者报道，麦克阿瑟总部劳工组官员已命令日本职工会不得采取反对反劳工法的政治活动。这个仿照美国塔夫脱——哈特莱反劳工法的议案，不久即将在日本议会中提出讨论。但日本产业劳动组合联合会仍重申其反对任何反劳工法的政策。
