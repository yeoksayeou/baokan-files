　　【Taiyuan Electric Dispatch】The Northwest Steel Plant, operated by the bandit Yan Xishan, was taken over by our Taiyuan Military Control Commission on the afternoon of April 21. More than 2,000 employees, including the plant director Liang Haiji, are all sticking to their posts and persisting in their work. Due to the rapid advance of the People's Liberation Army and the strict supervision of the workers, all the machines are in good condition. Before Taiyuan was liberated, Yan Xishan was unwilling to accept this, and on the morning of the 21st, he used artillery to bombard the steel plant, causing 16 workers to be injured. The water pipe of the waterwheel department was broken at 2:00 PM, and a section of the ore car of Blast Furnace No. 1 was broken off, and many electric wires in the plant were also damaged. The workers are very angry at Yan Xishan's shameless behavior and are actively repairing it. The initial takeover work of the plant has now been completed. The power department started work at 9:00 AM on the 25th, and the rolling steel department started work at 7:00 PM. The iron smelting furnace and coking furnace are also starting work one after another.

　　【Taiyuan Electric Dispatch】After the Northwest Coal Mine's No. 1 Plant was liberated on the 20th of this month, the workers actively prepared to resume work and production.

　　Since the Yan Xishan army destroyed the high-voltage lines and fled, the power supply from Taiyuan was cut off, and the underground drainage pump stopped rotating. By 5:00 AM on the 21st, the amount of water accumulated in the pit had reached 2292.36 cubic meters, and the water depth around the large and small roadways around the wellhead was half a meter. The workers discussed one after another: "Our machines have not been destroyed by the Yan Xishan bandits, and have been protected, and we must not let the water flood them!" Forty-seven workers from the electrical and mechanical departments immediately braved the biting cold to go into the water to dismantle the machines. By 7:00 PM on the 22nd, six water pumps and one ore car had been completely transported outside the pit. Then the staff of the electromechanical section studied and implemented a drainage method using ore cars to replace water pumps. At present, the danger of water flooding and destroying the mine pit has been completely eliminated, and production can be resumed quickly after the power supply arrives. After the takeover team came to the mine on the 21st of this month, they saw that the workers were living in extreme difficulty and immediately organized the workers to rush food to the factory for relief overnight. 33,000 jin have been transported so far, and grain is still being transported continuously. The workers' enthusiasm for resuming work and production is increasing day by day.

　　太原军管会进行接管工作
  　西北炼钢厂部分开工
    原第一煤矿亦准备复工
    【太原电】阎匪锡山经营的西北炼钢厂，已于四月二十一日下午为我太原军管会接收。该厂厂长梁海机以下两千余职工，都各守原职坚持工作。由于解放军进展迅速，工人看管严密，所有机器均完好无损。太原没解放前，阎匪对此并不甘心，二十一日早晨，曾用炮向炼钢厂轰击，致工人受伤十六人，水车部地下十四时水管打破，并打断炼铁炉一号高炉的高车的车一截，厂内之电线亦被损坏甚多。工人对阎匪之无耻行为非常愤恨，现正积极抢修。该厂接管初步工作现已告完成，二十五日上午九时动力科开工，下午七时碾钢科开工，炼铁炉、炼焦炉现亦陆续开始工作。
    【太原电】西北煤矿第一厂于本月二十日下午解放后，工人积极准备复工生产。
    该矿自阎匪军把高压线破坏逃跑后，来自太原的电源断绝，坑下排水机停止旋转，至二十一号早五时，坑内积贮水量已达二二九二·三六立方米，流集井口周围的大小行道水深半米。工人们纷纷议论：“咱们的机器没有被阎匪破坏，保护下来，更不能让水淹没！”电气系和机械系的四十七个工人马上冒着刺骨寒冷，下水拆卸机器，至二十二号下午七点，六部水泵一部高车已完全搭到坑外。接着机电科职工便研究出利用高车代替水泵的排水办法实行排水，目前水淹毁矿坑的危险已完全消除，电源到后即可很快复工生产。本月二十一日接管组来到该矿后，看到工人生活万分困难，立即组织了工人，星夜赶运粮食到厂救济，现已运到三万三千斤，现在仍继续运粮，工人复工生产情绪日益高涨。
