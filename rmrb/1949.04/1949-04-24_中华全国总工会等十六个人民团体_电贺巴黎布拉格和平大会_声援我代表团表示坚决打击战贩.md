Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 22nd: The All-China Federation of Trade Unions and fifteen other people's organizations yesterday sent telegrams to the World Congress of Supporters of Peace in Paris, congratulating the opening of the congress, and sent separate telegrams to the Chinese delegation attending the World Peace Congress in Prague and the Chinese delegation attending the Paris Peace Congress, expressing their support. The sixteen people's organizations that signed the telegrams are: All-China Federation of Trade Unions, China Liberated Areas Youth Federation, All-China Students' Federation, All-China Democratic Women's Federation, China Association of Scientific Workers, All-China Federation of Literary and Art Circles, North China Literary and Art Circles Association, China Association of Academic Workers, China Liberated Areas Journalists Association, China Youth Journalists Society, Shanghai People's Organizations Joint Conference, Beijing University Professors' Association, Tsinghua University Professors' Association, Yenching University Professors' Association, Normal University Professors' Association, Preparatory Committee of the United Association of Teachers and Staff of Primary and Secondary Schools in Beiping. The three telegrams are as follows:
(I)
To the Presidium of the World Congress of Supporters of Peace:
　　We are delighted to learn that the congress has opened as scheduled, and we extend our congratulations on behalf of the Chinese people. In recent years, the international reactionary and aggressive bloc headed by US imperialism has violated the will and interests of the people, conspiring to prepare for a new war of aggression, attempting to seize control of the world, and enslave the broad masses of people around the world who demand genuine democracy and lasting peace. The recent conclusion of the North Atlantic Treaty is a further manifestation of this conspiracy. The purpose of convening the congress at this time is to smash this conspiracy and defend world peace. We firmly believe that the delegates to the congress will be able to unite and carefully formulate a plan to call on the vast masses of peace-loving and democracy-supporting people around the world to resolutely fight against the crazy war preparations of the international reactionary bloc and realize genuine democracy and lasting peace throughout the world. The Chinese people have experienced many years of arduous struggle and have now basically defeated the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, the running dog of US imperialism. We represent the heroic Chinese people in declaring our determination: on the front of upholding peace and striving for democracy, the 475 million Chinese people will advance shoulder to shoulder with the people of all countries in the world. We send this telegram to congratulate you and wish the congress a complete success.
(II)
To the gentlemen of the Chinese Delegation to the World Peace Congress in Prague:
　　We learned from the newspapers that you have been restricted by the reactionary French government and cannot arrive in Paris as scheduled. We feel infinite indignation. You represent the wishes of the Chinese people and traveled a long distance to attend the grand gathering of international peace lovers. This action was originally intended to expose the conspiracies of the imperialist warmongers, but it was obstructed by the reactionary French government. This is another exposure of the warmongering intentions of the international reactionary forces. We feel indignant that your mission has been frustrated, and we send this telegram to express our condolences and support. At the same time, we are pleased to learn that you have already held a meeting in Prague, the capital of Czechoslovakia, with peace delegations from other countries, and are determined to give the obstructionist behavior of the international warmongers a crushing blow. The entire Chinese people respond to you and support you, and we will not relax our efforts in the slightest.
(III)
To the representatives of the Chinese delegation attending the Paris Peace Congress:
　　Recently, the reactionary French government restricted the entry of delegates from various countries attending the World Peace Congress in an attempt to obstruct the progress of the congress. We express our deep indignation. However, the will of the people of the world to love peace is firm and cannot be obstructed. The delegates who could not enter French territory are holding meetings simultaneously with you in Prague, the capital of Czechoslovakia. This shows that the forces of world peace are indivisible, and any destructive behavior by the reactionary forces is futile. We extend our deep condolences to you for your long journey and hard work in fighting for world peace, and we extend our warm congratulations to the Paris Congress. At the same time, we will resolutely support you with all our strength. We wish the peace conferences held simultaneously in Paris and Prague the ultimate success.

    声援我代表团表示坚决打击战贩
    【新华社北平二十二日电】中华全国总工会等十六个人民团体昨日致电巴黎世界拥护和平大会，庆贺大会开幕，并分电出席布拉格世界和平大会中国代表团及中国代表团出席巴黎和平大会代表，表示声援。具名的十六个人民团体为：中华全国总工会、中国解放区青年联合会、中华全国学生联合会、中华全国民主妇女联合会、中国科学工作者协会、中华全国文艺协会、华北文艺界协会、中国学术工作者协会、中国解放区新闻记者联合会、中国青年记者学会、上海人民团体联合会、北京大学教授联谊会、清华大学教授联谊会、燕京大学教授联谊会、师范大学教授会、北平市中小学教职员联合会筹委会。三电如下： 　 （一）
    世界拥护和平大会主席团：
    欣闻大会如期开幕，我们谨代表中国人民遥致庆贺。近年以来以美帝国主义为首的国际反动侵略集团，违反人民的意志和利益，阴谋准备新的侵略战争，企业占取全世界的统治，奴役全世界要求真正民主与持久和平的人民大众，最近北大西洋公约之缔结，为此种阴谋的进一步表现。大会于此时召开，其目的就在粉碎这种阴谋，保卫世界和平。我们深信大会代表必能以团结一致的精神，慎重订定方案，号召全世界爱好和平与拥护民主的广大人民，为反对国际反动集团之疯狂的备战阴谋，坚决奋斗，实现全世界的真正民主与持久和平。中国人民经历多年的艰苦战斗，现已基本上打垮美帝国主义走狗蒋介石匪帮。我们代表英勇的中国人民宣告我们的决心：在拥护和平与争取民主的战线上，中国四万万七千五百万人民，将与世界各国人民并肩前进。谨电驰贺，并祝大会胜利成功。
    （二）
    布拉格世界和平大会中国代表团诸位先生：
    从报上知道你们受到法国反动政府的限制，不能照原定计划如期到达巴黎，我们感觉无限的愤慨。你们代表着中国人民的愿望，远道奔赴国际爱好和平的盛大的集会，这一行动，本来就是要揭发帝国主义战争贩子们的阴谋，结果遭到法国反动政府的阻挠，这就是国际反动势力好战企图的又一暴露。我们怀念到你们的任务受到挫折的愤激，特驰电慰问，并表示支持。同时，我们闻悉你们已经会同其他国家的和平代表团在捷京布拉格举行会议，决心予国际战争贩子的阻挠行为以一个粉碎性的打击，我们不胜欣慰。全中国人民响应你们，支持着你们，我们是不会丝毫松懈我们的努力的。
    （三）
    中国代表团出席巴黎和平大会代表们：
    最近法国反动政府限制出席世界和平大会各国代表入境，企图阻挠这一大会的进行，我们深表愤慨。但全世界人民爱好和平的意志，是坚决不可阻挠的。不能进入法境的代表们，已经在捷克京城布拉格和你们同时举行会议。这说明世界和平力量是不可分割的，反动势力任何破坏的行为是徒然的。我们对你们长途跋涉，不辞艰辛，为争取世界和平而奋斗，致以深切的慰问，并向巴黎大会致以热诚的祝贺。同时，我们将坚决以全力支援你们。祝巴黎与布拉格两地同时召开的和平大会，获得最后的成功。
