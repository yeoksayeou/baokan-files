　　Supported by the Trade Company
　　Lifeng Dyeing Factory Resumes Production

　　[Ping City News] The Lifeng Dyeing Factory in this city, with the support of the department store of the trade company, resumed production on the 7th of this month and began dyeing cloth. The factory was established in 1938 and currently has eight dyeing machines, two calendering machines, one drying machine, one stretching machine, one spraying machine, one sizing machine, six bleaching tanks, and two boilers. In the past, due to the squeeze of American goods, the destruction of bureaucratic capital, and the impact of exorbitant taxes, it was frequently in a state of shutdown. After liberation, the department store of the trade company allocated 4,000 bolts of white cloth to assist it, and it was able to resume production. Currently, the workers are very enthusiastic, and on the third day of operation, they produced 500 bolts of cloth.

　　经贸易公司扶植
  　丽丰漂染厂复工
    【平市讯】本市丽丰漂染厂在百货公司扶植下，于本月七日起复工，开始染布。该厂于民国二十七年设立，现有染布机八个，压光机两个，干燥机一架，拉宽机一个，喷布机一个，上浆机一个，漂缸六个、锅炉二个。过去因美货排挤官僚资本摧残，及苛捐杂税的影响，经常陷于停工状态，解放后经贸易公司百货公司拨给白市布四千匹扶助，乃得复工，现工人热情很高，开工的第三天即出布五百匹。
