Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, 23rd—According to a Reuters dispatch from Manila on the 20th: U.S. diplomatic representatives from seventeen Asian and Pacific nations recently held their second meeting in New Delhi (the first meeting was held in Bangkok last June), lasting a week. The Second Secretary of the U.S. Embassy in the Philippines, who attended the meeting, stated: The meeting spent a long time discussing the Pacific Alliance issue. It is said that U.S. diplomatic officials are paying close attention to the Pacific Alliance. Immediately following the New Delhi meeting of U.S. diplomatic officials, the Quirino government, a loyal puppet of the United States, proposed the conclusion of a Pacific Pact at the second meeting of the Asian Conference. The second meeting of the Asian Conference was held in New Delhi from the 13th to the 14th and was conducted entirely in secret.
