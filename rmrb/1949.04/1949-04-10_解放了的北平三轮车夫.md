　　Liberated Beiping Rickshaw Pullers

　　There are over 40,000 rickshaw pullers in Beiping, the vast majority of whom rely solely on pulling rickshaws for a living. Some also engage in other occupations. For example, in the inner first district, most rickshaw pullers use one rickshaw each; some share a rickshaw, taking turns using it. Their rickshaws are mostly rented from rickshaw factories. Some, after working for a long time, save some money, or do some small business, or use some small skills to earn money and buy their own rickshaw. It is estimated that there are about four to five thousand of these self-owned rickshaws.

　　In the long past, the rickshaw pullers of Beiping, like those in all cities under Kuomintang rule, endured the pain of hunger, humiliation, persecution, and beatings. Therefore, they looked forward to the Liberation Army every day. When they heard the news of the Liberation Army entering the city at 1:00 PM on January 31st, they were ecstatic. Forty rickshaw pullers from Baofang Hutong spontaneously gathered and pulled their rickshaws all the way to Xizhimen, hoping that the Liberation Army would sit in their rickshaws and let them pull them into Beiping City. Rickshaw pullers in the inner six districts demolished the bricks and earth used by the Kuomintang reactionaries to block the city gates to welcome the Liberation Army. At the rally celebrating the liberation of Beiping, they pooled their money to buy paper and wrote many slogans, participating freely in this rally for the first time in history.

　　Since the Liberation Army entered Beiping City, the police who had oppressed them for so many years have changed for the better, and hooligans dare not bully them casually. They have gradually organized themselves, and each district of Beiping City has its own labor union. Now, to assist the People's Government in maintaining social order, they are investigating the identities of their members to eliminate various bad elements lurking in the unions.

　　In addition to establishing several consumer cooperatives to ensure that they are not or are less subject to merchant middleman exploitation, their unions are also actively preparing to establish production cooperatives. Forty shares of rickshaw pullers’ family members have joined the toothbrush production cooperative in Paozi River, and production will guarantee their lives. Of course, there are many difficulties at the beginning of the establishment, but the family members are all determined. Even if some private toothbrush factories compete, they firmly say: "We will work to the end and we will definitely succeed." However, a few rickshaw pullers have a misunderstanding, thinking that "no one can control me anymore," and as a result, some bad phenomena have occurred. For example, some rickshaw pullers park their vehicles arbitrarily, hindering traffic order. When getting on and off at the Beiping East Railway Station, some rickshaw pullers squeeze into the station to solicit customers randomly. Every night when the theater lets out at Dong'an Market, Jin Yu Hutong, which is already a narrow street, is almost completely blocked. In view of this, the rickshaw pullers' unions in various districts have launched discussions among the members of each union group, and they unanimously believe: "Today we are liberated, and no one scolds or beats us anymore. We must consciously abide by traffic order and never wait for others to interfere." After discussion, the phenomenon of rickshaw pullers squeezing in disorder has gradually decreased.

　　解放了的北平三轮车夫
    陈迹
    北平三轮车夫约有四万多人，其中绝大部分专靠蹬车为生。也有些兼营其他职业。如内一区的车夫，多数是一人用一车；也有两人共用一辆车，轮流使用的。他们的车子多向车厂租来，有些因为干久了，积余下一些钱，或另外作些小买卖，耍些小手艺，赚一些钱，买一辆车，自己使用。这种自用车，估计约有四五千辆。
    在过去漫长的岁月里，北平的三轮车夫和所有国民党统治的城市一样，忍受着饥饿、侮辱、迫害和殴打的痛苦。所以他们天天盼望解放军。一月三十一日下午一时听到了解放军入城的消息时，他们欢喜得发狂。报房胡同的三轮车夫自动聚集了四十人，把三轮车一直拉到西直门，他们盼望解放军坐上他们的车子，让他们拉进北平城。内六区的三轮车夫，把国民党反动派堵塞城门的砖土拆掉，来迎接解放军。在庆祝北平解放的大会上，他们凑钱买纸，写了许多标语，有史以来第一次自由的参加了这个大会。
    自从解放军进了北平城，多少年来欺压他们的警察改变得好多了，流氓也不敢随便欺侮他们了。他们已经逐步组织起来，北平市各区都有他们的工会。现在他们为协助人民政府维持社会治安，正进行调查会员的身份，肃清潜入工会的各种坏分子。
    他们的工会除了已成立若干消费合作社，保证他们不受或少受商人的中间剥削外，并正积极筹组生产合作社。泡子河的车夫家属加入牙刷生产合作社的已有四十多股，生产将要保障他们的生活。在开始成立时，当然有不少的困难，但是家属们都抱着很大的决心。即使有些私营的牙刷厂竞争，他们还坚决的说：“我们干到底，一定能成功。”但是，也有少数三轮车夫发生一种误解，以为“谁也不能管我了”，于是产生了一些不好现象。例如，某些车夫随便停放车辆，妨碍交通秩序。北平东站上下车的时候，有的车夫随便挤进站去乱拉客人。东安市场每逢入夜散戏时，挤得那条窄窄的金鱼胡同几乎断绝了交通。各区三轮车夫工会有鉴于此，曾发动各工会会员小组展开讨论，他们一致认为：“今天解放了，没有人打骂了，更要自觉的遵守交通秩序，决不要等别人来干涉。”经过讨论，现在三轮车夫乱挤的现象已在逐步减少。
