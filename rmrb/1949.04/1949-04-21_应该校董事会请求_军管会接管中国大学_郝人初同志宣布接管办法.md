　　Upon Request of the School Board
　　Military Control Commission Takes Over China University
　　Comrade Hao Renchu Announces Takeover Measures
　　[Reported by this newspaper] After the Cultural Takeover Committee of the Ping City Military Control Commission repeatedly studied and discussed the request of the board of directors of the private China University on March 26, it sent personnel to the school's Yixian Hall at 2:00 PM on the 19th to hold a general meeting of all teachers, students, and staff to announce the takeover of the school. First, Comrade Zhang Zonglin elaborated that the People's Government's policy towards private schools is to help them exist and develop, not to generally abolish them. However, China University is facing financial difficulties, a lack of teachers, and, in recent years, rampant secret agents, which has greatly affected the school's reputation. It really does not have the conditions to continue operating. Therefore, the takeover was approved, and it was clearly pointed out that the faculty, staff, and students of China University have a great future in the people's revolution. Everyone was encouraged to strengthen their studies and strive to transform themselves. Then, Comrade Hao Renchu announced the takeover measures for China University:
　　(1) The Military Control Commission will allocate 2 million People's Currency to China University to be used for clearing back wages of faculty and staff, as well as for water and electricity expenses. (2) The College of Science of China University will be transferred to Beijing Normal University for continued operation. Faculty, staff, students, and original housing and equipment will also be transferred to Beijing Normal University. (3) The school buildings and equipment of the Colleges of Liberal Arts and Law will be transferred to the People's Revolutionary University. Staff and security guards will be employed and handled separately by the Revolutionary University. (4) Faculty and students of the Colleges of Liberal Arts and Law will be recommended to the Revolutionary University and China University respectively on a voluntary basis. Teachers can enter the Political Research Institute of China University. (5) In order to implement the above matters, a joint processing committee will be formed by representatives from the Education Department of the Cultural Management Committee, China University, and Beijing Normal University to be responsible for handling the matter, and will work at China University. The process must be completed before the 24th of this month. Borrowed books must be returned within the specified period; otherwise, no procedures will be processed. The meeting lasted two hours and ended in warm applause.
