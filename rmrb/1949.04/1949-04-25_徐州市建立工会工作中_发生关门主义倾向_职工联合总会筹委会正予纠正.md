　　【Xinhua News Agency, Xuzhou, April 24th】 Serious "closed-doorism" tendencies exist in the work of establishing trade unions in Xuzhou. This has aroused the vigilance of the Preparatory Committee of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, and they are taking steps to correct it. In the four months since liberation, the preparatory committees of trade unions in the city's fifteen public enterprises have only developed forty-four members. Among them, eleven major state-owned factories, including the Jinpu and Longhai railway stations and repair shops, and the match factory, have not a single member. Among the nearly ten thousand coolie workers, two hundred and sixty members have been developed. Before the establishment of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions Preparatory Committee, the work of developing and organizing workers was carried out without a plan. After the establishment of the Municipal Preparatory Committee, trade union cadres arbitrarily stipulated excessively high membership conditions and repeated membership procedures, restricting the vast number of workers from joining the trade union. For example, the membership conditions for coolie workers stipulated that they must have good political awareness, be selfless and able to work for the masses, have faith among the poor, and be able to connect with the masses, etc. Other membership procedures required new members to have group discussions, old members (from old liberated areas or other regions) to pass through the group, and finally, the approval of the Municipal Preparatory Committee, etc. These regulations are far from the charter of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions. The main reason for the above-mentioned erroneous tendencies is that many trade union cadres, especially leading cadres, have not seriously studied the charter of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and who can join the trade union. At the same time, they do not understand or understand very vaguely the point that the Communist Party relies first on the working class in urban work. They overemphasize the complexity among workers and organize trade unions in the way that the Party's work is developed. Secondly, in some enterprises, the comrades in charge of trade union work subjectively believe that there are too few cadres and no foundation among the workers. Therefore, they do not dare to boldly establish trade union organizations, recruit members, or work in the trade union. In order to completely transform and correct the above-mentioned errors, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions Preparatory Committee, in addition to conducting in-depth self-criticism, has specifically decided that all trade union cadres and all subordinate trade union preparatory committees should study the charter of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions and relevant documents such as the Northeast Daily's editorial on correcting the "closed-doorism" tendency in the establishment of trade unions, correctly recognize the bias they have committed and its ideological roots, and, in connection with the inspection of the trade union work of their own department or factory, accept experience and lessons, and quickly launch the city's workers' movement.

　　徐州市建立工会工作中
    发生关门主义倾向
    职工联合总会筹委会正予纠正
    【新华社徐州二十四日电】徐州市建立工会工作中存在着严重的关门主义倾向，已引起市职工联合总会筹委会的警惕，并正在着手纠正中。在解放以来的四个多月中，全市十五个公营企业的工会筹委会只发展了四十四个会员。其中津浦、陇海两站和修械厂，火柴厂等十一个主要公营工厂，则一个会员也没有。在近万的苦力工人员中发展了二百六十个会员，在市职工总人筹委会未建立以前，发展和组织职工的工作没有计划地进行；市筹委会成立之后，工会工作干部又擅自规定发过高的入会条件和反复听入会手续，限制广大的职工加入工会，如苦力工人入会条件中规定要政治认识好，大公无私能为群从办事，在穷人中有信仰、能联系群众等。其他入会手续，某厂规定要有新会员。小组讨论，老会员（从老解放区或其他地区的来的）小组通过，最后还要市筹委会批准等。这此规定远背发中华全国总工会章程，造成上述错误倾向的主要原因，是由于许多工会工作干部特别是领导干部没有认真研究学习中华全国总工会章程，什么人可以入工会，同时对于共产党在城市工作中首先依靠工人阶级这一点也不了解或者了解得很模糊，过分强调了工人中间的复杂性，以发展党的工作方式来组织工会，其次，在有些企业中。负责工会工作的同志主观地认为干部太少，工人中还没有基础等。因而不敢大胆在建立工会组织、吸收会员、在工会中。市职工筹委会为求得彻底转变与纠正上述错误，除进行深刻检讨以外，特决定所有工会工作干部与所属各个工会筹委会都学习中华全国总工会章程及东北日报关于纠正建立职工会中的关门主义倾向的社论等有关文件，正确认识所犯偏向及其思想根源，并联系检查本部或本厂的职工工作，经接受经验教训，迅速开展全市的职工运动。
