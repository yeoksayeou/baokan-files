Three New Creations of Workers at the Nankou Zhangjiakou Railway Machinery Factory
    By our reporter Lü Guangming

    Wind-nest rivet caps – One hammer strikes four rivets
    In order to make the Ping-Sui railway fully operational as soon as possible, the workers of the Nankou and Zhangjiakou Railway Machinery Factories are actively producing track spikes. Wang Guofu, the foreman of the forging workshop at the Nankou Machinery Factory, developed a method of striking double track spike blanks with one hammer. In the past, when using a pneumatic hammer to strike track spike blanks, one person would use tongs to hold and strike one track spike iron bar for each hammer stroke. The entire workshop could produce 2,600 track spike blanks in eight hours. Now, with the same amount of time and one stroke of the pneumatic hammer, two people can each hold and strike one track spike iron bar. The entire workshop now produces 5,200 track spike blanks per day, doubling work efficiency. However, the workers still felt it was too slow, and everyone unanimously wanted to work two extra hours. The daily output has now increased to 6,800. The blacksmithing team at the Zhangjiakou Machinery Factory uses four people to hold and strike track spike blanks with one stroke of the pneumatic hammer, increasing output by three times compared to before. Regarding the manufacture of track spike caps, which previously required three or four people using hammers to rivet, producing only three to four hundred per day, the workers of the forging and riveting workshops at the Nankou and Zhangjiakou Machinery Factories have successively created new methods of riveting track spike caps using wind-nest machines. The heated track spike material is clamped onto a leaky plate, and one press of the wind machine creates one. Not only is it fast, but the work produced is also regular and smooth. Three or four people tending one furnace can gradually increase the daily output from the initial 300 to over 700, more than twice as fast as manual riveting.

    Self-made welding rods – Can perform all general welding tasks
    Welding rods for repairing vehicles used to be purchased from abroad. Now that the supply routes have been cut off, and the existing stock is about to run out, leading comrades and some workers are worried: What will we do if we can't get welding rods from outside? Chen Guihua, a young worker and electrician at the Zhangjiakou Vehicle Inspection Section, which had just resumed work after liberation, actively sought solutions. He re-experimented with a coating formula that had been preserved for many years but never successfully tested. He spent 160 yuan in people's currency to buy more than ten kinds of items such as water glue, borax, salt, red soil, charcoal residue, and lime. He also obtained some lead wire from the electrical department. After more than seven days of meticulous research, especially in adjusting the amount of medicine, he finally achieved preliminary success. It is now being used to repair vehicles. Using this type of welding rod, all general welding tasks can be performed. The Railway Bureau leadership, recognizing the significant contribution of his creation to future production and construction, not only issued a circular of commendation but also decided to increase his salary by two grades as a reward. He is continuing his research to make the welding rods even better.

    Creating a smoke pipe welding frame – Welds are strong and smooth
    Locomotive boiler smoke pipes have always been conventionally welded with oxygen. During the Japanese puppet regime of Mengjiang, the Japanese tried to weld locomotive boiler smoke pipes with AC welding machines but failed. After Zhangjiakou was liberated again, the supply of oxygen was difficult, and the price was very expensive. Yang Huating, an old railway worker in the riveting group of the Zhangjiakou Machinery Factory, proposed using DC welding machines to weld smoke pipes. Workers Lu Zhenxing, Li Fucheng, Xu Mengqin, Xiao Yulu, Xu ＠, and others in the group, after five or six days of design and research, created a smoke pipe welding frame. They used scrap iron to assemble a channel iron eight inches wide and one zhang six chi long, with arched brick pipes three inches thick at both ends, to make a movable shaft for supporting the smoke pipe. They also used five gears connected to the movable shaft supporting the smoke pipe and used a wind drilling machine that could not do proper work to drive the gears, which in turn drove the smoke pipe. This rotation is very suitable for the speed of electric welding. It saves one person and avoids the problem of uneven speed when rotating by hand. After the successful creation of this welding frame, they began to trial-weld the large smoke pipes of MA-type locomotive boilers. After this type of welding, the joint is strong and smooth. When testing the water pressure (i.e., testing whether the welding is truly strong), the pointer of the pressure gauge pointed to the highest pressure—400 pounds—without any leakage. The welded smoke pipe was also dropped from a height of more than one zhang to the ground, or hammered, without any cracks. This is a great success. For a locomotive with thirty-six large smoke pipes, it used to take two people one and a half days to weld using oxygen, but now it only takes six hours to complete all the work. Not only does it save man-hours, but it also saves oxygen and calcium carbide.

　　南口张垣铁路机厂工人的三种新创造
    本报记者  吕光明
    风窝窝钉帽  一锤打四钉
    为了使平绥全线早日通车，南口、张垣两铁路机厂的职工们，积极生产道钉。南口机厂锻工所领班王国富，研究出一锤打双道钉料的办法来。过去用气锤打道钉料，开一次锤，只是一个人用钳子夹打一块道钉铁条，全所八小时可出道钉料二千六百个。现在以同样时间，开一次气锤，可由两个人各夹打一块道钉铁条，全所日产五千二百个，工作效率增强了一倍。但工人们还嫌慢，大伙一致要加工两小时。现日产量竟增加到六千八百个。张垣机厂打铁组，开一次气锤，用四个人夹打道钉料，出产量较前能增加三倍，道钉帽的制造，过去一向是三个人或四个人用锤子铆，每天只能出三四百个，南口、张垣两机厂的锻工所和铆炉所的工人们，先后创造了利用风窝机窝铆道钉帽的新办法，把烧红的道钉料，卡在漏盘上，拿风机一按压，就是一个，不但快，作出活来又规矩又光溜，三个人或四个人守一盘炉，由最初日产量三百个，逐渐增加到七百多个，比手工铆要快一倍多。
    自己造的电焊条  一般焊活全能做
    修理车辆的电焊条，过去都是从外国买来的。现来路断绝，原存的也将用完，领导同志和一些工人们都发愁：外边的焊条来不了可怎么办？解放后刚刚复工的张垣检车段电焊匠，青年工人陈贵华，积极想办法，把保存多年，从未试验成功的涂料药方，重新作试验，他用一百六十元人民券，买了水胶、硼砂、食盐、红土、炭碴、石灰等十余种物品，又从电务股要了些铅丝电线，经过七天多的精心研究，特别是调配药量，终于初步试验成功。现在开始用它修理车辆。使用这种电焊条，一般的焊活全能做。路局领导上，因他这种创造对今后生产建设上贡献很大，除通令表扬外，还决定给他提高二级薪金，以示奖励。他为了把焊条制造得更好一些，正继续研究。
    创造烟管电焊架  焊得结实又平整
    机车锅炉烟管，向来是习惯用氧焊接的。在伪蒙疆时代，日本人曾用交流电焊机试接机车锅炉烟管而未成功。张垣重获解放后，氧气来源困难，价格也很贵，张垣机厂铆工组的老工务员杨华亭，提议使用直流电焊机焊接烟管，该组工人卢振兴、李福成、徐梦勤、萧玉禄、徐＠等，经过五六天的设计研究，创造烟管电焊架。他们利用废铁料，装成一条宽八英寸、长一丈六英尺的槽铁，两端用三英寸粗的拱砖管，制成托烟管的活动轴，又用五个牙轮，接到托烟管的活轴上，再用一个不能作正经活计的风钻机，来带动着牙轮，使牙轮再带动烟管。如此转动，很适合电焊的速度。既省去一个人，又避免了用手转动速度不均匀的毛病，此项焊架创制成功后，便开始试焊ＭＡ型的机车锅炉的大烟管，经过这种焊接之后，接口处又结实又平整，试水压时（即考验一下是否真正焊接结实了），压力表的指针指到最高压力——四百磅时，一点不漏水，又将焊接成的烟管从丈余高处往地下摔，或用锤子打，都没有丝毫裂纹，这是一个很大的成功。一部机车整三十六条大烟管，过去使用氧气焊接时，两个人需要一天半，现在只需要六小时，即能全部完工。不但节省了工时，还节省下氧气和电石。
