Tianjin Dispatch: Upon hearing the news that the Kuomintang reactionary government had rejected the domestic peace agreement and that Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu had issued a general offensive order, all circles in Tianjin were exceptionally excited. Employees of various public and private enterprises and factories expressed their opinions one after another. Units such as the Transportation Department, the Postal Bureau, Tianjin Transportation Company, and Pingtang Highway Engineering Office held timely symposiums. Employees of various units of the Pingjin Railway Bureau sent nearly a hundred letters to the Tianjin Daily that evening, unanimously expressing their firm support for the orders of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and their determination to step up transportation and production to support the army's advance and liberate all of China. After hearing the news that the Kuomintang had rejected the peace agreement, workers at the East Station immediately issued a bulletin, writing: "This is another time that Chiang Kai-shek has torn off his mask. We must strengthen transportation and support the front lines." Worker Jiao Chunnian said, "It's good that the agreement wasn't signed. We'll dig out the roots and finish the job completely, simply, and happily. Otherwise, it will sprout again." Jia Guizhen, a female worker at the Tianjin Woolen Mill, said, "They weren't really sincere in negotiating peace. They were messing with us." Professors, teachers, and students from major middle schools and universities also unanimously stated that Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu's orders were in line with the wishes of all the Chinese people. Teng Weizao, a professor in the Economics Department of Nankai University, said, "The failure of the peace talks is a concrete manifestation of the Kuomintang reactionaries' continued refusal to repent. The army crossing the river will bring more benefits to China in the future. The basic military strength of the Kuomintang reactionary forces can be said to have been largely defeated this time. We cannot fall short of success." Wu Daren, a professor in the Mathematics Department, hoped that the remaining military forces of the Kuomintang reactionaries would be eliminated more quickly, which would also help world peace. Professor Long Yin said: The Kuomintang wants to use peace talks to catch their breath, delay time, and dream of a third world war to save them. This dream is completely shattered. Members of the Second Detachment of the Tianjin Southbound Work Group immediately shouted when they received the news: "Our time to carry out our mission has come!" Each squadron's study group immediately launched discussions and wrote letters of determination. Li Zhuchen, general manager of Jiuda Refined Salt Company, said: "The Kuomintang is too arrogant. They have brought China to such a bad state, and they still don't admit their mistakes. As soon as the army crosses the river, neither Bai Chongxi nor Tang Enbo will be able to stop the People's Liberation Army's offensive." The broad masses of citizens also heard the same calls. In the evening, when ordinary citizens heard the cries of the extra edition, they rushed to buy it and told each other, "Great, great, we are going to fight to the south of the Yangtze River!" Crowds of people gathered everywhere, talking angrily and excitedly. The head of 26th Street in the Ninth District publicly read out the extra edition on the street. After listening, four or five hundred people shouted in unison: "Fight to Nanjing, go south of the Yangtze River and liberate all of China!" Everyone had full confidence in the future when the people of the whole country would be completely liberated. Cui Zhibo, who sells fried cakes on Sixth Street in the Sixth District, said, "It will be fast once we cross the river." Many citizens are preparing to support the war with practical actions. Du Menglan, a female doctor on Fourth Street in the Sixth District, said to the soldiers: "You are making contributions on the front lines, and we will take good care of your families. Don't worry!"
