　　Fourth Field Army Officers and Soldiers
  　Are as Close as Brothers on the Southern Expedition
    [Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 20th] After rectifying the relationship between officers and soldiers and improving company management, the various units of the People's Liberation Army's Fourth Field Army generally have very close and harmonious relations between cadres and soldiers on this southward journey. At the end of the army's political rectification, each company held a democratic meeting focusing on self-criticism. Cadres and soldiers deeply examined the shortcomings in the relationship between officers and soldiers in the past and formulated a convention for cherishing soldiers and respecting cadres. The cadres guaranteed to improve management methods, pay attention to taking care of the soldiers' lives, strengthen ideological education and the study of military, political, and cultural subjects, and help the soldiers progress. The soldiers proposed that they should be more self-respecting, proactive, and conscious in the future, and strive to do a good job in revolutionary work to avoid causing the cadres to worry. In order to celebrate the close unity between officers and soldiers, each company solemnly held a unity and progress meeting. At the meeting, the conventions were read out, oaths were taken, and cadre representatives and the chairman of the soldiers' committee shook hands tightly under the red flag to express their close unity. Since then, the entire army has become more vigorous and energetic, and has embarked on the journey with high morale. During the march, the cadres were able to lead by example, helping the soldiers to carry guns, wash their feet, and carry burdens, and let the livestock ride those soldiers who could not walk. Zhang Fengming, the instructor of a certain company, helped the porters carry burdens almost every day. Most of the cadres took out their allowances or disability pensions to buy food for the sick. In order to reduce the fatigue and worry of the cadres, many soldiers used various methods to conceal their illnesses and gritted their teeth to persevere in the march. Some soldiers spontaneously organized a comfort group, and went to comfort each class when they arrived at the camp, so that the cadres could have more rest time. Some soldiers surrounded the instructors who came to see them, one pouring hot water, another taking off shoes, and beckoning the instructors to wash their feet. They said: "The cadres have worked too hard, and they still have to be busy for us soldiers after arriving at the camp, let's wash our feet first!" In this atmosphere of love pervading the entire army, no one was left behind in one week of marching in a certain unit.

　　第四野战军官兵
  　南征途中亲如兄弟
    【新华社北平二十日电】人民解放军第四野战军各部，经过整顿官兵关系，改善连队管理后，在这次南下途中，干部和战士一般都很亲密融洽。在该军政治整训末期，各个连队都曾召开以自我批评为主的民主大会，干部和战士都在会上深刻的检讨了过去官兵关系上的缺点，并订出爱护士兵与尊重干部公约。干部们保证改善管理方式，注意照顾战士生活，加强思想教育和军事政治文化的学习，帮助战士进步；战士们则提出今后要更加自爱、自动、自觉，努力把革命工作做好，免得干部操心。为了庆祝官兵之间的亲密团结，各连队又隆重举行了团结进步大会。在会上宣读公约，进行宣誓，干部代表和士兵委员会主席在红旗下紧紧握手，以志亲密团结。自此以后，全军更加生气蓬勃，士气饱满踏上了征途。行军中干部们都能以身作则，帮助战士背枪、洗脚、挑担，并把牲口让给走不动的战士骑。某连指导员张凤鸣几乎每天帮助挑夫挑担子。大多数的干部，拿出自己的津贴费或残废金给病号买东西吃。不少战士为了减少干部的疲劳和操心，用种种方法隐瞒自己的病痛，咬牙坚持行军。有的战士自动组织了慰问组，每到宿营地就到各班慰问，使干部能有更多的休息时间。有的战士把前去看望他们的指导员围起来，你端热水，他脱鞋，招呼指导员洗脚，他们说：“干部们太辛苦了，到宿营地后还要为我们战士忙，先洗洗脚吧！”在这种洋溢全军的友爱气氛中，某部行军一周间，没有一个人掉队。
