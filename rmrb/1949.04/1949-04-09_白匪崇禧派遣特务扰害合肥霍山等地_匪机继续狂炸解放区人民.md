Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains, 7th. War criminal Bai Chongxi has dispatched a large number of agents, colluding with bandits and hooligans, to organize reactionary armed forces and carry out arson, murder, looting in the liberated areas. In the middle of last month, agents dispatched by Bai Chongxi led bandits to harass the county seat of Huoqiu, looting a large amount of grain, and wounding more than ten local soldiers and civilians. In Hefei, Huoshan, Jinzhai, Shucheng and other areas, there have also been organized assassinations, robberies and other sabotage activities by agents. The various atrocities committed by the warlord Bai Chongxi, who is known for his insidious and viciousness, under the smokescreen of peace talks, have aroused boundless anger among the people in various places, who have demanded that the People's Liberation Army quickly liberate Wuhan, eliminate the reactionary nests, and eliminate harm for the people.
Xinhua News Agency, Central China, 7th. Kuomintang bandit planes have continued to bomb and strafe the liberated areas for days. On March 31, a Kuomintang plane strafed Nantong, Tangjia Zha, Beiyang Bridge and other places, killing one resident and injuring six. On the same day, four enemy planes dropped several incendiary bombs in Jiangdu, Qinzhou, Majia Bridge, and Sixiangkou, killing one resident and injuring thirteen, and burning ten civilian boats. On the morning of the 1st of this month, an enemy plane strafed over Hefei City, and in the afternoon, two enemy planes bombed Wanglonggang in the east of Hefei City, dropping six incendiary bombs. Nearby houses caught fire and were extinguished by local soldiers and civilians. The Kuomintang reactionaries' crimes of stepping up the bombing of the liberated areas at the time of the peace talks have made the people in the liberated areas see even more clearly their hideous faces behind their hypocritical rhetoric.

　　白匪崇禧派遣特务扰害合肥霍山等地
  　匪机继续狂炸解放区人民
    【新华社中原七日电】战犯白崇禧派遣大批特务分子，勾结土匪流氓，组织反动武装，在解放区进行烧杀抢掠。上月中旬，白崇禧派遣的特务分子即率领土匪骚扰霍邱县城、抢去粮食甚多，并击伤当地军民十余人。合肥、霍山、金家寨、舒城等地区亦发生特务分子有组织的暗杀抢劫等破坏活动。以阴险毒辣出名的军阀白崇禧在和谈的烟幕下所进行的各种暴行，激起各地人民无比的愤怒，纷纷要求人民解放军迅速解放武汉，剿灭反动巢穴，为民除害。
    【新华社华中七日电】国民党匪机连日继续轰炸扫射解放区。上月三十一日国民党飞机一架扫射南通、唐家闸、北洋桥等地，炸死居民一人，伤六人。同日，敌机四架在江都、秦州、马家桥、寺巷口投燃烧弹数枚，共炸死居民一人，伤十三人，烧毁民船十只。本月一日上午敌机一架在合肥城上空扫射，同日下午敌机两架轰炸合肥城东王隆岗，投燃烧弹六枚，附近民房起火，经当地军民抢救扑灭。国民党反动派在和谈之际加紧轰炸解放区的罪行，使解放区人民更加看出其在虚伪的辞令背后的狰狞面目。
