　　Greeting Red May
  　Shijiazhuang Telephone Bureau Work Competition
    [Shijiazhuang News] The Shijiazhuang Telephone Bureau held a general meeting of all employees on the afternoon of the 22nd of last month, deciding to launch a new work competition to greet "Red May." After the meeting, employees of all sections, offices, and departments actively discussed and formulated plans, preparing to challenge each other. On the 23rd, the female comrades of the answering platform took the lead in proposing: Repair broken telephones themselves, without delaying the work of the repair room; guarantee to test 600 telephone lines every morning; learn repair skills in the afternoon; classify the numbers of agencies, schools, enterprises, and businesses; and organize them. And make a quick reference table of the more commonly used and important numbers to improve work efficiency. Move the answering platform's telephone sets according to two-earphone transmitters and switchboards, so that when answering user inquiries, there is no need to put down the earphones to check the numbers, which is more convenient than using a small switchboard, and answering is more convenient and faster. The mechanical room proposed: Connect empty telephone numbers to the answering platform, so that if someone calls that number, they can be notified that the number is empty. Simplify the numbers of the test platform and answering platform to make them easy for users to remember. Guarantee that at least three destroyed IVW machines (a type of component on the mechanical room's automatic telephone equipment) and distribution frames will be repaired (each worth about 5,000 yuan in People's Currency), try winding burnt electromagnets and interrupters, and reconnect broken jumpers as challenge conditions.

　　迎接红五月
  　石市电话局工作竞赛
    【石家庄讯】石家庄电话局上月二十二日下午召开全体职工大会，决定展开新的工作竞赛，迎接“红五月”。会后，各科、股、室职工积极讨论制订计划，准备相互挑战。二十三日答问台的女同志首先提出：电话坏了自己修，不耽误修机室工作，每天上午保证试验完六百户电话，下午学习修机，将机关学校企业商户的号码分门别类，加以整理。并将比较常用的和重要的号码作速见表，以提高工作效率。把答问台的话机按两个耳机送话器搬闸，这样答用户询问时，不必将耳机放下再查号码，比按小交换机省事，答问时又方便迅速。机械室提出：把空号电话接至答问台，如有人叫到该号时，即可通知用户此号为空号。把试验台、答问台的号码简单化，使用户容易记忆。保证将被炸毁的ＩＶＷ机器（机械室自动电话机械上的一种机件）及配线至少修好三个（每个约值人民券五千元），试缠被烧坏的电磁石及断续器，把断碎跳线统接起来等作为应战条件。
