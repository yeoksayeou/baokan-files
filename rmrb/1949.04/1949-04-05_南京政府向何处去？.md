　　Where is the Nanjing Government Going?

　　Two paths lie before the Nanjing Kuomintang government and its military and political personnel: one is to lean towards the Chiang Kai-shek war criminal clique and its master, American imperialism. This means continuing to be the enemy of the people and perishing together with the Chiang Kai-shek war criminal clique in the People's Liberation War; the other is to lean towards the people. This means breaking with the Chiang Kai-shek war criminal clique and American imperialism, performing meritorious service to atone for one's crimes in the People's Liberation War, and seeking the people's forgiveness and understanding. There is no third way.

　　In the Li Zongren and He Yingqin government in Nanjing, some people still insist on taking the first path. No matter what they say verbally, in action they are actively preparing for war, continuing to sell out the country, and continuing to oppress and massacre the people who demand genuine peace. They are Chiang Kai-shek's die-hard followers. Some people are willing to take the second path, but they have not yet gained a leadership position, and they cannot take decisive action. The third group is some people who are wandering astray and whose direction is unclear. They want to play both sides and profit from both sides. They neither completely stand on the side of Chiang Kai-shek and American imperialism, nor completely stand on the side of the people's democratic camp. They do not want to offend Chiang Kai-shek and American imperialism, and they also want to gain the understanding and acceptance of the people's democratic camp. But this is just wishful thinking. The facts require them to express a clear position—either this or that. They think that their "middle" position can gain the favor of most people, but the fact is that if they continue to hold this illusion, they will not be trusted by anyone. They will go bankrupt like the reactionaries, or even go bankrupt earlier.

　　The Li Zongren and He Yingqin government in Nanjing, including its Zhang Zhizhong delegation, is basically a mixture of the first and third groups to this day, with very few people in the second group. Because of this, the actions of this government, to this day, are still tools of Chiang Kai-shek and the American government. Some spokespersons of this government try to ask the people to believe their "sincere desire for peace," but the power holders of this government are making greater efforts to protect the reactionary forces, protect the interests of the Chiang Kai-shek war criminal clique, and protect the interests of the American aggressors. The soft creatures in the Li Zongren and He Yingqin government who verbally claim to want peace are not only unwilling, dare not, and cannot distinguish themselves from Chiang Kai-shek and his die-hard followers, but they also depend on Chiang Kai-shek and his die-hard followers everywhere, and show their loyalty to Chiang Kai-shek and their cooperation with Chiang Kai-shek's die-hard followers everywhere. This reactionary position cannot but arouse the people's anger, hatred, and condemnation. Military and political personnel in the Nanjing Kuomintang reactionary traitorous government, no matter who they are, have the opportunity to perform meritorious service to redeem themselves, but they must not expect to rely on such a reactionary position to obtain the people's understanding. Only when they have taken concrete actions, declared their separation from Chiang Kai-shek in Xikou, from Chiang Kai-shek's die-hard followers in Nanjing, Shanghai, Hankou, Xi'an, Chongqing, Guangzhou, and Taiwan, and from Chiang Kai-shek and his die-hard followers' master, American imperialism, in Nanjing, Shanghai, Tokyo, and Washington, and taken concrete actions to implement the eight peace conditions of the Chinese Communist Party, will they truly begin to lean towards the people and have the opportunity to gain the people's understanding.

　　The tragedy that occurred in Nanjing on April 1 was not an accidental event. This is the inevitable result of the Li Zongren and He Yingqin government's evil policy of leaning towards Chiang Kai-shek and Stuart but not towards the people. This is the inevitable result of the Li Zongren and He Yingqin government protecting Chiang Kai-shek, protecting Chiang Kai-shek's die-hard followers, and protecting American aggression forces. This is the inevitable result of the Li Zongren and He Yingqin government absurdly advocating the so-called "equal and glorious peace" together with Chiang Kai-shek's die-hard followers, in order to resist the eight peace conditions of the Chinese Communist Party, especially to resist the punishment of war criminals. The Nanjing tragedy once again proves that the Li Zongren and He Yingqin government, which adopts such a reactionary policy, absolutely cannot control Chiang Kai-shek and his die-hard followers, even within the capital of Nanjing, but can only be controlled by Chiang Kai-shek and his die-hard followers. Since the Li Zongren and He Yingqin government has sent a peace negotiation delegation to Beiping to negotiate peace with the Chinese Communist Party and expressed its willingness to accept the eight conditions of the Chinese Communist Party as the basis for negotiations, then, if this government has the minimum sincerity, it should take the handling of the Nanjing tragedy as a starting point, arrest and severely punish the chief culprits Chiang Kai-shek, Tang Enbo, and Zhang Yaoming, arrest and severely punish the special agent thugs in Nanjing and Shanghai, and arrest and severely punish those who resolutely oppose peace, actively sabotage the peace talks, and actively prepare to resist the People's Liberation Army's advance south of the Yangtze River with military, political, open, and secret methods. If Qingfu is not dead, the disaster in Lu will not end; if war criminals are not eliminated, the country will have no peace. Is this truth still not clear now?

　　We would like to solemnly tell the Nanjing government: if you do not have the ability to do this, then you should also assist the People's Liberation Army, which is about to cross the river and advance south, to do this. If you are unwilling to help, there will be helpers. There are many people who are willing to perform meritorious service to contribute to the country or atone for their crimes. Today, all empty talk is unnecessary. It is better to do something practical to contribute to the country or atone for one's crimes, so as to avoid fleeing, avoid being bullied by Chiang Kai-shek's die-hard followers again, and avoid being spurned by the people forever. There is only this one chance, do not miss this opportunity. The People's Liberation Army is about to advance to the south of the Yangtze River. This is not to scare you with empty talk. Whether you sign an agreement accepting the eight conditions or not, the People's Liberation Army will always advance. Signing an agreement and then advancing is beneficial to all parties—beneficial to the people, beneficial to the People's Liberation Army, beneficial to all those in the Kuomintang government system who are willing to perform meritorious service to contribute to the country or atone for their crimes (such people account for the absolute majority in the Kuomintang government system), and beneficial to the vast number of officers and soldiers of the Kuomintang army. It is only detrimental to Chiang Kai-shek, to Chiang Kai-shek's die-hard followers, and to the imperialists. Not signing this agreement, the situation is the same. The problem is still to be solved by peaceful methods and local negotiations one place at a time. There may still be some battles, but there will not be many battles. In such a vast area and a long front from Xinjiang to Taiwan, there are only about 1.1 million Kuomintang troops left for combat. There are not many battles to fight. Whether a comprehensive agreement is signed or many local agreements are signed without signing this agreement, the situation is the same for Chiang Kai-shek, for Chiang Kai-shek's die-hard followers, and for American imperialism—in a word, for all reactionaries who will never change until their death. They will be decisively destroyed. And for other people—for the people, for the People's Liberation Army, for the vast number of officers and soldiers of the Kuomintang army, for all those in the Kuomintang government system who are willing to perform meritorious service to contribute to the country or atone for their crimes—it is all beneficial, or relatively beneficial. Perhaps signing a comprehensive agreement is slightly more beneficial to both the Nanjing side and our side than not signing this agreement, so we are still striving to sign this agreement. But to sign this comprehensive agreement, we must be prepared to deal with many dragged-out matters. It would be much more straightforward for us not to sign this agreement and to sign many local agreements. Even so, we are still prepared to sign this agreement. If the Nanjing government and its delegation are also willing to do so, then they must make a decision in the next few days. All illusions and all empty talk should be discarded. We do not force you to make this decision. The Nanjing government and its delegation have their own freedom to make this decision. That is to say, you either listen to Chiang Kai-shek and Stuart's words and stand with them forever, or you listen to our words and stand with us. You have your own freedom to choose between these two. But the time for choosing is not much left. The People's Liberation Army is about to march. There is no room for hesitation.

### 南京政府向何处去？

　　南京政府向何处去？
    两条路摆在南京国民党政府及其军政人员的面前：一条是向蒋介石战犯集团及其主人美国帝国主义靠拢，这就是继续与人民为敌，而在人民解放战争中与蒋介石战犯集团同归于尽；一条是向人民靠拢，这就是与蒋介石战犯集团和美国帝国主义决裂，而在人民解放战争中立功赎罪，以求得人民的宽恕和谅解。任何第三条路是没有的。
    在南京的李宗仁何应钦政府中，有一部分人仍然是坚持走第一条路。无论他们在口头上怎样说，在行动上他们是积极备战，继续卖国，继续压迫和屠杀要求真和平的人民。他们是蒋介石的死党。也有一部分人愿意走第二条路，但是他们还没有取得领导地位，他们还不能作出有决定性的行动。第三部分人是一些徘徊歧途、行向不明的人们。他们既要左右开弓，又想左右逢源。他们既不完全站在蒋介石和美国帝国主义方面，又不完全站在人民民主阵营方面，既不想开罪于蒋介石和美国帝国主义，又想得到人民民主阵营的谅解和容纳。但是这只是幻想。事实要求他们表示明确的立场——非此即彼。他们自以为他们的“中间”立场可以得到多数人的好感，事实却是如果他们继续抱持这种幻想，他们将不为任何人所置信，他们将与反动派同样地破产，甚至更早地破产。
    南京的李宗仁何应钦政府，包括它的张治中代表团在内，到今天为止，基本上是第一部分人和第三部分人的混合物，第二部分人为数甚少。因为这样，这个政府的行动，到今天为止，仍然是蒋介石及美国政府的工具。这个政府的某些代言人试图要求人民相信他们的“和平诚意”，但是这个政府的掌权者，却用更大的努力来保护反动势力，保护蒋介石战犯集团的利益，保护美国侵略者的利益。李宗仁何应钦政府中的口称要求和平的软体动物，不但不愿、不敢、不能把自己区别于蒋介石及其死党，而且处处与蒋介石及其死党相依为命，处处表明自己对于蒋介石的忠心，表明自己对于蒋介石死党的合作。这种反动的立场，当然不能不引起人民的愤怒、痛恨和唾骂。南京国民党反动卖国政府中的军政人员，无论何人，都有向人民立功自赎的机会，但是他们决不能指望依靠如此反动的立场来获取人民的谅解。只有当他们已经采取确实的行动，宣布他们自己与溪口的蒋介石决裂，与南京、上海、汉口、西安、重庆、广州、台湾的蒋介石死党决裂，与南京、上海、东京、华盛顿的蒋介石及其死党的主人美国帝国主义决裂，并采取确实的行动来执行中国共产党的八项和平条件，他们才会真正地开始向人民靠拢，才有取得人民谅解的机会。
    四月一日发生于南京的惨案，不是什么偶然的事件，这是李宗仁何应钦政府采取靠拢蒋介石、司徒雷登而不靠拢人民的罪恶政策的必然结果，这是李宗仁何应钦政府保护蒋介石、保护蒋介石死党、保护美国侵略势力的必然结果，这是李宗仁何应钦政府与蒋介石死党一同荒谬地鼓吹所谓“平等的光荣的和平”、借以抵抗中共八项和平条件、特别是抵抗惩办战争罪犯的结果。南京的惨案，又一次证明了采取如此反动政策的李宗仁何应钦政府，甚至在南京的都门之内，也绝对不能控制蒋介石及其死党，而只能被蒋介石及其死党所控制。李宗仁何应钦政府既然派出和谈代表团前来北平与中国共产党谈判和平，并表示愿意接受中国共产党的八项条件以为谈判的基础，那么，如果这个政府是有最低限度的诚意，就应当以处理南京惨案为起点，逮捕并严惩主凶蒋介石汤恩伯张耀明，逮捕并严惩在南京上海的特务暴徒，逮捕并严惩那些坚决反对和平、积极破坏和谈、积极准备以军事的政治的公开的秘密的方法抵抗人民解放军向长江以南推进的反革命首要。庆父不死，鲁难未已，战犯不除，国无宁日。这个真理，难道现在还不明明白白么？
    我们愿意正告南京政府：如果你们没有能力办这件事，那么，你们也应协助即将渡江南进的人民解放军去办这件事。你不愿帮忙，自有帮忙者，愿意立功自效或立功自赎的人是很多的。时至今日，一切空话不必说了，还是做件切实事情，借以立功自效或自赎为好。免得逃难，免得再受蒋介石死党的气，免得永远被人民所唾弃。只有这一次机会了，不要失掉这个机会。人民解放军就要向江南进军了。这不是拿空话吓你们的，无论你们签订接受八项条件的协定也好，不签这个协定也好，人民解放军总是要前进的。签一个协定而后前进，对几方面都有利——对人民有利，对人民解放军有利，对国民党政府系统中一切愿意立功自赎或立功自效的人们（这种人们占国民党政府系统中的绝对大多数）有利，对国民党军队的广大官兵有利，只对蒋介石，对蒋介石死党，对帝国主义者不利。不签这个协定，情况也是一样的，问题还是一处一处地用和平方法、用局部谈判的方法去解决。可能还有些战斗，但是不会有很多的战斗了。从新疆到台湾这样广大的地区内和漫长的战线上，只有一百一十万左右的国民党军的作战部队了，没有很多的仗可打了。无论签订一个全面性的协定也好，不签这个协订而签许多局部性的协定也好，对于蒋介石，对于蒋介石死党，对于美国帝国主义，一句话，对于一切至死不变的反动派，情况都是一样的，他们将决定地灭亡。而对于其他的人们—对于人民，对于人民解放军，对于国民党军队的广大官兵，对于国民党政府系统中的一切愿意立功自效或立功自赎的人们，就都是有利，或比较地有利的。也许签订一个全面性协定对于南京方面和我们方面，都比较不签这个协定，来得稍微有利一些，所以我们还是争取签订这个协定。但是签订这个全面性协定，我们须得准备应付许多拖泥带水的事情。不签这个协定而去签订许多局部协定，对于我们要爽快得多。虽然如此，我们还是准备签订这个协定。南京政府及其代表团如果也愿意这样做，那么就得在这几天下决心，一切幻想和一切空话都应当抛弃了。我们并不强迫你们下这个决心。南京政府及其代表团是否下这个决心，有你们自己的自由。就是说，你们或者听蒋介石和司徒雷登的话，并和他们永远站在一起，或者听我们的话，和我们站在一起，对于这二者的选择，有你们自己的自由。但是选择的时间没有很多了，人民解放军就要进军了，一点游移的余地也没有了。
