　　Shijiazhuang Cadre Cultural Remedial School
　　Teaching Content Strives for Accessible
　　[Shijiazhuang News] The Shijiazhuang Cadre Cultural Remedial School recently held its first teacher meeting and proposed improving the teaching content and gradually moving towards regularization. (1) Diversification and simplification of teaching materials: For middle and primary school courses, such as Chinese language classes, articles of various styles can be selected, without necessarily following the textbook; the meaning can be simplified, while vocabulary, grammar, and syntax should be explained in detail. More emphasis should be placed on practical writing. Complex arithmetic problems must be illustrated with more examples. Advanced physics classes: Generally considered difficult, in the future, the focus should be on explaining specific things rather than principles. (2) Adding political classes: Many new cadres urgently request to learn policies, work styles, and cadre self-cultivation. Special political reports can be given on Sundays.
　　[Another News] The Shijiazhuang Third District Workers' Union and the Coking Plant Workers' Union have opened evening remedial schools to improve workers' cultural and technical skills. Over one hundred workers from various industries in the Third District have enrolled, and classes began on the 9th of last month. More than forty students from the Coking Plant have enrolled, and classes began on the 7th of this month.

　　石市干部文化补习学校
  　教学内容力求通俗
    【石家庄讯】石市干部文化补习学校，日前召开第一次教员会议，提出改进教学内容，逐步走向正规。（一）教材多样化与通俗化：中小学的课程，如国文课，可选各种体裁的文章，不必按课文进行，文意可以简略些，词句及文法则尽量求其祥细。多选应用文。复杂的算术题目，必须多举例子。高级物理课：一般感到深，今后尽量少讲原理多讲具体事物。（二）增添政治课：许多新干部，迫切要求学习政策、工作作风、干部修养等。可利用礼拜日作专题政治报告。
    【又讯】石家庄三区职工会与炼焦厂职工会为提高工人文化、技术，开办业余补习夜校。三区百余行业工人报名学习，已于上月九日开学。炼焦厂参加学员四十余人，已于本月七日上课。
