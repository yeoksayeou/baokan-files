[Jilu Yu Electric Dispatch] The Propaganda Department of the Third Prefectural Committee of the Jilu Yu Region conducted a strict inspection of the slogans in the Chengguan District of Shanxian County. According to statistics, there are a total of 167 slogans in Chengguan, Shanxian. First, in terms of content, due to an insufficient understanding of policy propaganda, there are many fundamental errors. For example, regarding enemy and puppet personnel and fugitive landlords, the slogans only promote that landlords and their families should be given the same share of land and property as peasants, but fail to promote that the main culprits must be dealt with. This is unprincipled leniency and violates the Party's policy. Second, the slogans do not differentiate between targets, applying the rural set to the city in its entirety. For example, slogans such as "Organize manpower and animal power to quickly plant wheat," etc. Of course, it cannot be said that these types of slogans are completely unnecessary in small cities, but the voice of the workers and our Party's policy towards intellectuals are neglected, and the policies towards industry and commerce are also written very little about. Furthermore, reactionary slogans from the enemy and puppet period have not been erased in a timely manner, or have not been thoroughly erased, and still have traces. The instruction from the Propaganda Department of the District Party Committee to "erase outdated, non-compliant, and unexamined slogans" has not been well implemented, resulting in the retention of slogans such as "Welcome the powerful summer offensive." This also fully demonstrates a lack of attention to organization and discipline. In addition, in terms of slogan writing technique, there are cases of ungrammatical sentences or missing characters, such as the "qian" character missing from "Jiang bandit is finished before our eyes" (蒋匪完蛋在眼前). Moreover, the handwriting is crooked, illegible, and inverted. In order to correct the above errors and shortcomings, and to ensure that future slogans can complete the Party's task of publicizing current events and policies in each period, the Propaganda Department of the Third Prefectural Committee decided to erase and rewrite the slogans in Chengguan, Shanxian County.

　　单县标语错误潦草地委决定涂掉重写
    【冀鲁豫电】冀鲁豫区三地委宣传部，对单县城关区标语，进行严格检查。据统计，单县城关标语共一百六十七条，首先在内容上，由于对政策宣传认识的不够，所以有许多原则性的错误。如对敌伪人员、逃亡地主，只宣传地主及其家属分给与农民同样的一份土地财产，而没有宣传首恶者必办。这是一种无原则的宽大，违反了党的政策。其次写标语不分别对象，把农村的一套，全搬进城里来。如“人力畜力组织起来，快快种麦”等标语，当然，这类标语不能说在小城市完全不需要，但对工人的呼声和我党对知识分子政策的宣传却被忽视了，对工商业政策也写得很少。再对敌伪时期的反动标语，也未及时涂掉，或涂抹得不彻底，仍有痕迹。对区党委宣传部“要涂抹过时的、不合规定与未经审查的标语”的指示，没有很好执行，以致还保留着：“迎接强大的夏季攻势”等标语。这也充分地说明对组织与纪律不够重视。另外在标语技术上，有句子不通或掉字的情形，如“蒋匪完蛋在眼前”的“前”字也掉了。而且字迹歪斜、潦草、颠倒。为了纠正上述错误与缺点，使今后的标语能完成党在每个时期对时事、政策的宣传任务，三地委宣传部决定将单县城关标语涂掉重写。
