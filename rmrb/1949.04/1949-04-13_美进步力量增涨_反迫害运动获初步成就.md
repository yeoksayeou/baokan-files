Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 12th: TASS, New York: American progressive forces are achieving some success in their efforts to resist the reactionaries' attempts to force through repressive local laws. According to the Worker's Daily, the Wisconsin legislature has cancelled the establishment of a committee to "investigate the tendency of employees in industrial enterprises to subvert the government and anti-American activities" after a meeting of trade union members, farmers, and educators. More than 500 representatives of the Communist Party, trade unions, the Progressive Party, and farmers' associations entered the meeting hall when the Minnesota House of Representatives Legal Committee met on the 6th, to protest against the anti-communist bill. Opposition to five anti-communist bills in Illinois is growing.

    【新华社北平十二日电】塔斯社纽约讯：美国进步力量在其抵抗反动派打算强迫通过镇压性的地方法律的企图中，正获得某些成功。据工人日报报道：威斯康星州议会在职工会员、农民、教育工作者会议后，已经取消成立委员会，以“调查工业企业雇员中颠覆政府的倾向及反美活动”法案。共产党、职工会、进步党、农会的代表共五百多人，在六日明尼苏达州众议院法律委员会开会的时候，走进会场，提出对反共法案的抗议。伊利诺斯州对于五项反共法案的反对，正增涨不已。
