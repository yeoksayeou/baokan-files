　　After Listening to Comrade Ren Bishi's Political Report
  　Attending Representatives Unanimously Supported It
    Discussions in Groups Late into the Night Increased Everyone's Confidence
    [Special Dispatch from Our Newspaper] Reporter Jin Feng reports: After listening to Comrade Ren Bishi's report, the National Youth League representatives first clarified in their minds the Party's emphasis on youth work and the important role of youth work in the revolution and in future construction. For example, a worker representative from Harbin in the Northeast Delegation said: "In the past, although I did youth work myself, because various parties did not pay enough attention to youth work, thinking it was children's work, I also wavered. After listening to the report, my confidence has increased, and I am personally willing to learn in youth work." A farmer representative from the Northwest Delegation announced the results of their group's discussion: "Because Comrade Bishi's report mentioned that the focus of future work is on construction, and construction requires the joint efforts of young people, everyone connects the importance of construction to the importance of youth work. At the same time, in the past, some comrades in the Northwest had vague understandings of building the League, thinking it was biased towards students, and many farmer cadres did not have the confidence to do youth work. Now they realize the importance of the position of workers and peasants in youth work, and the previous doubts have disappeared. Moreover, this report is so persuasive and instructive that it will be of great help to the future development of youth work and the establishment of the Youth League when brought back and studied with the Party committees at all levels." The East China Delegation said that because this conference was held so grandly, and the conference elected Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and other leaders of the Chinese Communist Party to participate in the presidium of the conference, and Commander-in-Chief Zhu and Comrade Ren Bishi personally attended the report, they said: "Comrade Bishi so clearly and historically analyzed the youth movement, pointing out that we should let go and let young cadres carry out the work of building the League, which can indeed solve the problem." They also believed that Comrade Bishi's report clearly analyzed the current situation and tasks, summarized the past thirty years of youth work, pointed out its achievements, biases, and the direction of future work, and placed youth work in an appropriate position, enabling them to have a clear basis for carrying out League work in the future, learn from historical lessons, avoid repeating past mistakes, and move forward in the correct direction. In addition, a student representative from the Northeast Delegation said: "The report mentioned that we should do our best to cultivate young people to learn various kinds of knowledge, so that we students who have just come from the old society clearly realize the happiness of being in the new society, and also think of the future generations, who will surely be even happier. We are truly deeply moved by the love of the Chinese Communist Party and the comrades of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China for us young people." Another comrade said that he saw that Comrade Bishi was in poor health, panting when he spoke, and he sat there without rest for two days of the meeting, working carefully and cautiously, and correcting even a punctuation error in the report on the spot, which made him ashamed of feeling tired when sitting in the meeting and being careless in his work. He said that he must study hard when he goes back.

　　听了任弼时同志政治报告
  　到会代表一致拥护
    各组连夜讨论大家信心更加提高
    【本报特讯】记者金凤报导：全国青年团代表们听了任弼时同志的报告，首先在思想上明确了的是党对于青年工作的重视和青年工作在革命中及在今后建设中的重要的作用，如东北解放区代表团哈尔滨的一位工人代表说：“过去我自己虽做青年工作，但因各方对于青年工作不够重视，以为是小孩子工作，我也动摇起来。听了报告以后，信心增加了，个人愿意在青年工作中去学习”。西北代表团一位农民代表发表他们小组讨论的结果：“由于弼时同志报告中说到今后工作重心在建设，建设需要青年们来共同努力，大家由于对于建设认识的重要而联系到认识青年工作的重要。同时过去在西北有些同志对于建团认识模糊，以为偏重于学生，许多农民干部就没有信心做青年工作，现在认识到青年工作中工农位置的重要，消失了以前的疑虑。而且这个报告如此有说服性和指导性，带回去和各级党委一起研究，对于今后青年工作开展与建立青年团，一定有很大帮助。”华东代表团则因此次大会召开，如此隆重，大会选了毛主席、朱总司令和中共其他领袖，参加了大会主席团，朱总司令、任弼时同志又亲自出席报告，他们说：“弼时同志如此明晰地历史地分晰了青年运动，指出要放手一些让青年干部进行建团工作，的确能够解决问题。”他们并认为弼时同志的报告，清楚地分晰了目前形势和任务，总结了过去三十年的青年工作，指出了它的成就、偏向和今后工作的方向，把青年工作放在一个适当的位置上，使他们对于以后开展团的工作有了明确的根据，接受历史教训，不致再犯过去错误，而能依循正确方向前进。此外，东北代表团中一位学生代表说：“报告中说到要尽力培养青年学习各种知识，使我们才从旧社会走过来的学生明显地意识到处在新社会的幸福，而且想到未来的一代，他们一定会更幸福。我们真是深深为中国共产党和中共中央同志对于我们青年的爱护而感动。”另一位同志则说到他看到弼时同志身体不好，说话都气喘，而开会两天都一直坐着不休息，工作细心谨慎，报告中一个标点错误都当场校对，使他很惭愧于开会时坐着觉得疲倦，工作时粗枝大叶，他说他回去一定要好好学习。
