　　Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, 18th: New York dispatch: The United Nations Third Second General Assembly held its first plenary meeting on the 12th, and decided on two resolutions: one to include the Indonesian question on the agenda, and the other to include the so-called "investigation of whether Hungary and Bulgaria are complying with basic human rights and freedoms" on the agenda. The second topic was opposed by many countries such as the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, Poland, and Yugoslavia.
　　The General Assembly plenary meetings continued on the 13th and 14th, discussing the so-called "Security Council voting issue," or the "revision of the veto power" issue.
　　Opponents of the United Nations Charter had proposed at the Paris meeting of this General Assembly suggestions to "request a General Assembly to revise the Charter," and suggestions seeking to limit the rights of the permanent members of the Security Council. However, due to the Soviet Union's opposition, these suggestions were rejected at that time. However, opponents of the Charter are now adopting roundabout means, trying to exploit loopholes in the nature of the issues submitted to the Security Council for consideration. The representatives of the United States, Britain, France, and China (Kuomintang) jointly proposed a motion at this General Assembly, which stated that the member countries of the Security Council consider many issues that may be submitted to the Security Council for consideration to be "procedural issues." Since the permanent members of the Security Council do not have veto power when considering procedural issues, the true meaning of this motion is very clear. This motion believes that procedural issues should include the following important issues: for example, submitting any issues related to the maintenance of international peace and security to the United Nations General Assembly, the convening of special sessions of the General Assembly, the adoption of the Security Council's annual report to the General Assembly, and the organization of the Security Council's work, etc. These issues are clearly not procedural issues. In order to oppose this motion aimed at undermining the United Nations Charter, the Soviet delegation proposed another motion, calling on all member states of the United Nations to abide by the noble principles of the Charter, which have been recognized by all peace-loving countries, and work together to further consolidate the prestige of this organization.

　　葛罗米柯为联合国宪章辩护
  　主张维护大国一致原则
    抨击美帝集团妄想修改“否决权”
    【新华社北平十八日电】纽约讯：联合国第三届第二次大会于十二日举行首次全体大会，当决定决议二项，一将印尼问题列入议程，二将所谓“调查匈牙利及保加利亚是否遵守基本人权及自由”问题列入议程，第二个议题曾受到苏、捷、波、南许多国家的反对。
    大会全体会议于十三、十四两日继续举行，讨论所谓“安理会表决问题”，或者叫做“修改否决权”问题。
    联合国宪章的反对者，曾经在本届大会的巴黎会议上提出过“要求召开大会修改宪章”的建议，以及寻求限制安理会常任理事国权利的建议，可是，由于苏联的反对，这些建议当时都被否决了。然而，宪章的反对者，现在又采用了迂回的手段，他们想在送交安理会审议的问题的性质上钻空子。美、英、法、中（国民党）的代表们，在这次大会上联合提出一项议案，该议案称：安理会的理事国家认为许多可能提交安理会审议的问题是“程序问题”。由于安理会的常任理事国在审议程序问题时没有否决权，因此，这个议案的真意是很明白的。这个议案认为，程序问题应该包括下述重要问题：例如，向联合国大会提出任何有关保持国际和平与安全的问题，联大特别会议的召集问题，安理会提交大会常年报告的通过问题，组织安理会工作的问题等等，这些问题显然都不是程序问题。为了反对这一旨在破坏联合国宪章的议案，苏联代表团提出另一议案，号召联合国的一切会员国，遵照已为一切和平国家所承认的宪章的高尚原则，共同努力，更加巩固这个组织的威信。
