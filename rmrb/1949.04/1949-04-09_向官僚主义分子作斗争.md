　　After entering large cities such as Beiping and Tianjin, the vast majority of our party and army cadres have maintained the good style of hard struggle and serving the people diligently, earning the praise of urban workers and all working people. This style must be maintained, carried on and promoted. However, a few comrades have not completely followed this style, but have been influenced by the Kuomintang bureaucratic style, leading to corruption and degeneration in their lives, acting like overlords towards the people, and losing the proper stance of a Communist Party member. Comrade Lin Zi'an, director of the Zhangjiakou Railway Sub-bureau, is one such typical example.

　　Entrusted by the Party and the people with the important position of director of the Zhangjiakou Railway Sub-bureau, Comrade Lin Zi'an should, in principle, be humble and prudent, diligent and thrifty, unite the staff, and work hard; but he did not do so. He considered himself an official, treated the work entrusted to him by the Party and the people, and treated the workers and revolutionary staff with a bureaucratic attitude as a people’s superior, an overlord. This "people’s superior" bureaucratic thinking and style of Comrade Lin Zi'an must be thoroughly examined and criticized.

　　First of all, he completely ignored the enthusiasm of workers and revolutionary staff for the people's revolutionary cause. Instead of cultivating this enthusiasm, he suppressed it. He adopted an indifferent attitude towards the reinstatement of workers and revolutionary staff dismissed by the Kuomintang reactionaries, as well as issues such as salaries after reinstatement. He used extremely harmful methods such as dismissal and demotion to suppress outstanding workers and revolutionary staff who were promoted during the railway repair and frontline support efforts. The bad consequences of his very wrong measures were to make workers and revolutionary staff doubt the revolutionary nature of the people's revolutionary cause. Objectively, his measures were completely acts of hostility towards workers and revolutionary staff, and hostility towards the revolutionary cause. He suppressed righteousness and supported evil, using bad people instead of good people in personnel matters. On the contrary, we must wholeheartedly rely on the working class, unite all working people, unite all revolutionary intellectuals, and unite all those who are fighting for the people's revolutionary cause in order to transform and build a new China well. There is no other way.

　　Secondly, Comrade Lin Zi'an flaunted his power and put on airs in front of the working class, seriously damaging the Party's political influence among the masses. On February 1st, when he went to Fengtai for a meeting, he ordered the railway bureau to prepare a special train for him, a first-class sleeping car, occupied by himself and the law enforcement team guards and clerks, etc., and another flatcar carrying his small sleeping car. Before departure, he telegraphed the staff of each station to await instructions and "report on work" (?) He marched mightily straight to the capital. What prestige this was! After receiving the order, the staff of Nankou were busy cleaning the platform and station, and tidying up the interior. It was truly a hardship for us, the common people. When the special train arrived at the station, all the staff lined up on the platform to welcome him and await instructions. Unfortunately, the director was unwell and could not witness his appearance or hear his teachings in person. What a pity, what a pity. This bad habit of riding special trains, taking cars, being followed by many attendants, and having the staff along the way line up to welcome him is only something that the already decaying Kuomintang officials had this shameful and disgusting set of behavior. The good staff have long been disgusted with this set of behavior. Therefore, when Director Lin had a cold, and a comrade from his entourage gave a few words of instruction on his behalf, the already dissatisfied staff could no longer tolerate it, and only became more resentful, sneering: "The Kuomintang director came out in a special train, and the People's Liberation Army is doing the same thing!" What we need is not this, but people who wholeheartedly serve the people, treat the people as superiors, and are willing to serve the people as servants, people who are "willing to be an ox for the children."

　　Comrade Lin Zi'an is indifferent to the interests of the working class, arrogant and conceited in front of the working class, flaunting his power and putting on airs. This is completely a reflection of the Kuomintang officials' and bureaucrats' privileged thinking within our Party. This thinking is precisely the root cause that prompts Comrade Lin Zi'an to imitate the Kuomintang officials' bad bureaucratic style. We believe that the Nankou staff's attitude of sneering at bureaucratic elements is completely necessary, it is a manifestation of righteousness, and should be commended. We must treat bureaucratic elements with a serious attitude, and any carelessness or indulgence is not allowed. In order to give Comrade Lin Zi'an himself and the entire Party and army in North China a practical lesson, we suggest: dismiss Comrade Lin Zi'an from his leadership position, and replace him with a comrade who does not have bureaucracy and is willing to be a servant for the people to take on this position.

　　All comrades of the Party in North China should take the mistakes committed by Comrade Lin Zi'an as a warning, deeply reflect on themselves, strive to improve their awareness, examine their behavior, and strictly prevent the occurrence of bureaucracy.

### 向官僚主义分子作斗争

　　向官僚主义分子作斗争
    进入平津等大城市以后，我党我军绝大多数干部都保持了艰苦奋斗、给人民当勤务员的好作风，获得城市工人及一切劳动人民的赞许。此种作风，必须继续保持和发扬光大。但有少数同志，并不完全循此作风前进，却受了国民党官僚主义作风的影响，生活腐化堕落，向人民作威作福，失掉共产党员应有的立场。张垣铁路分局局长蔺子安同志，便是其中的典型例证之一。
    蔺子安同志身受党和人民的委托，担负着张垣铁路分局局长的重要职务，论理就应当虚心谨慎，克勤克俭，团结员工，好好工作才是；但他没有这样做，他自己是做官了，是以人民的上司，作威作福的官僚主义态度，对待党和人民所委托他的工作，对待工人和革命职员。蔺子安同志这种人民上司官僚主义的思想作风，必须予以清算。
    首先他十分忽视工人和革命职员对人民革命事业的积极性，他不培养而是打击这种积极性，对于被国民党反动派开除的工人和革命职员的复工问题，及复工后的薪资等问题，采取漠不关心的态度；对于在抢修铁路，支援前线中被提拔起来的优秀工人和革命职员，则以撤消与降职等极端有害的办法打击他们。他这种十分错误的措施所造成的恶果，是使工人和革命职员对人民革命事业的革命性发生怀疑。他这种措施，客观上完全是敌视工人和革命职员，敌视革命事业的行为。他是打击正气扶植邪气，在用人上他是用坏人不用好人。恰恰相反，我们必须全心全意地依靠工人阶级，团结一切劳动人民，团结一切革命知识分子，团结一切为人民革命事业而奋斗的人们，才能把新中国改造好，建设好，除此以外，则别无他途。
    其次就是蔺子安同志在工人阶级面前抖威风，摆臭架子，严重地损害了党在群众中的政治影响。二月一日他到丰台开会时，他命令路局为他准备专车，一节头等卧车，坐着他本人和执法队警卫员及科员等，另一节车皮载着他的小卧车。且于出发前电令各站员工，听候训话与“汇报工作”（？）浩浩荡荡，直驶京城而来，这是何等威风，南口职工接到命令后，即忙打扫月台车站，整理内务，真是吾侪小民苦矣，专车到站时，全体职工在月台上列队欢迎，听候训话，不幸局长身体不适，未能目睹容颜，亲聆教益。憾甚、憾甚。这种坐上专车，拉上汽车，随从累累，让沿路员工列队欢迎的恶习惯，只有已经濒于腐朽的国民党官老爷们才有此可耻的令人恶心的一套，善良的职工们，对此一套早就讨厌透了，因而当着蔺局长有些感冒，由随从的某同志代训了几句话之后，本来就不满意的职工，对此就再不能忍耐，只有更其反感，嗤之为：“国民党局长出来坐专车，解放军也闹这一套”！我们所需要的，不是这些，而是全心全意为人民服务的人，把人民当成上司，而自己甘心情愿为人民作勤务员的人，“俯首甘为孺子牛”的人。
    蔺子安同志，对工人阶级利益漠不关心，在工人阶级面前骄傲自大，抖臭威风，摆臭架子，这完全是国民党官老爷们、官僚主义特权思想，在我们党内的反映，这种思想正是促使蔺子安同志极力摹仿国民党官老爷们的恶劣的官僚主义作风的根源。南口职工对官僚分子嗤之以鼻的态度，我们认为这是完全必要的，这是正气的表现，应该加以表扬。我们必须以严肃的态度，对待官僚主义分子，任何马虎、放纵都是不许可的。为了使蔺子安同志本人及华北全党全军得到切实的教训，我们建议：撤消蔺子安同志的领导职务，代之以没有官僚主义的、愿意给人民当勤务员的同志担任此项职务。
    华北党的全体同志，均应以蔺子安同志所犯错误，作为鉴戒，深自惕励，努力提高自己的觉悟，检查自己的行为，严防官僚主义的发生。
