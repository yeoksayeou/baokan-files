Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, April 27th: Guo Moruo, head of the Chinese delegation to the World Peace Congress, delivered a speech to the Congress (Editor's note: This article is the draft of Mr. Guo Moruo's speech to the Congress left to our agency before he went abroad to attend the meeting. Mr. Guo's speech has been published simultaneously in Prague and Paris, and the original manuscript is published here.) The text is as follows:

　　In World War II, mainly through the efforts of the Allied Soviet Union, Nazi Germany was defeated in Europe and Japan was defeated in Asia. We won the war. Less than four years after the end of the fighting, before peace treaties with Germany and Japan have been concluded, and while the people of the world have not yet caught their breath, the imperialist war instigators are already inciting a third world war.

　　The world has been divided into two distinct camps: on one side is the aggressive camp headed by US imperialism, and on the other side is the democratic peace camp headed by the socialist country of the Soviet Union.

　　The big capitalists of the United States made huge profits in World War II. In order to maintain their profits, they even wanted to use money and atomic weapons to monopolize the world. Their huge claws stretched to every corner of the world, constantly expanding a huge network of military bases, funding reactionary forces in various countries to suppress the people, suppress the national liberation struggles in colonies and semi-colonies, and plot all kinds of piratical alliances, actively challenging the democratic peace camp. The United Nations Charter has long been trampled on, and the threat of war does indeed exist.

　　We understand very clearly that US imperialism is accustomed to using rhetoric to deceive the world, slandering the Soviet Union, the bastion of peace, as a totalitarian country, and disguising its own aggressive actions with the name of "aid." But we Chinese people know very clearly that it was the Soviet Union that first abolished unequal treaties in China, that it was the Soviet Union that helped us oppose imperialism and strive for independence and freedom from 1926 to 1927, and that it was still the Soviet Union that unconditionally helped us resist Japan when Japanese imperialism launched a large-scale invasion in 1937. What about the United States? Of course, the American people are friends of the Chinese people. We have not forgotten Stillwell and Carlson's friendship with us to this day. However, the American imperialist government has always been deeply colluding with China's reactionary warlords and comprador classes, cunningly carrying out its economic and cultural aggression. When we were fighting against Japanese imperialism in the early stages, US imperialism supplied Japanese imperialism with large quantities of cotton, scrap iron, gasoline, munitions, and machinery, indirectly presiding over its war of aggression. After the Pearl Harbor Incident, the United States declared war on Japan, but the US government's policy toward China violated General Stillwell's wishes, only helping the Kuomintang reactionaries and unwilling to help the People's Liberation Army. After Japan surrendered and the war no longer existed, the US government's support for the Kuomintang reactionaries continued to expand, and it arbitrarily stationed troops in our country and expanded military bases at will. According to US official acknowledgment, the total amount of direct "aid" and US military spending in China after the war has reached 4.4 billion US dollars. In addition, there are projects that have been acknowledged but whose amounts have not been announced, which are not included. US imperialism, with such great efforts to aid the reactionary Chiang Kai-shek, was intent on making China a colony of US imperialism and using it as an anti-Soviet base. Thus, after eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan, an unprecedented large-scale civil war was triggered. We are the country that has suffered the most, and therefore we know the aggressive ambitions of US imperialism most thoroughly.

　　The Chinese people regard the instigator of aggressive war as the common enemy of all mankind.

　　Today, the reactionary Chiang Kai-shek, who was fostered by US imperialism in China, has been defeated by the Chinese people's military force. But US imperialism's ambitions have not been quelled, and it has turned to supporting the remnants of Japanese fascism. In Europe, it is even more rampant in carrying out activities against the Soviet Union and against the people of all Europe. The North Atlantic Treaty is a very obvious signal of a new war. The tricks that US imperialism once inflicted on our Chinese people are now to be inflicted on the European people, and even all of mankind. We Chinese people cannot but regard this instigator of imperialist war as the common enemy of all mankind.

　　The crisis of a new war must not be allowed to continue to exist and grow. The forces of peace-loving people all over the world must strengthen their unity and take organized and step-by-step actions to overcome this crisis. Although US imperialism is arrogant and domineering, and seems invincible, its internal contradictions are serious. It relies on war to bring about abnormal prosperity, and it delusionally wants to reorganize war to prevent its prosperity from disappearing. This is tantamount to drinking poison to quench thirst, digging its own grave. The strength of the people of the world has made considerable progress since the war. The Soviet Union's post-war five-year plan is proceeding smoothly, the new democratic countries in Eastern Europe are becoming increasingly consolidated, the national liberation wars in the East are rising like a storm, and the people of various imperialist countries have a broad awakening and unity. This peace and democracy camp, led by the Soviet Union, as long as it keeps its steps more orderly and does not make mistakes, already has sufficient strength to send the war crisis, along with the war instigators themselves, into the grave.

　　The peace and democracy camp has sufficient strength to send the war crisis and the war instigators into the grave!

　　Therefore, we believe that today is the time for us to raise our vigilance and review our strength. We are very excited that today, in Paris, this World Peace Congress is being held, gathering peace-loving people from all over the world, outstanding representatives of workers, peasants, youth, and women, authoritative scholars and artists, to jointly discuss the steps to uphold peace, and to accept and solemnly answer the challenge of the war instigators. We Chinese people are doing our utmost to support this conference, and therefore we have sent this delegation to participate. Here are representatives from various fields such as workers, youth students, women, literature and art, academia, education, news, and religion. Although our numbers are not large, we represent the vast masses of the Chinese people, except for a few reactionaries. We are under the orders of the people, and we are here to express the will of all the Chinese people: we want to participate actively and resolutely in the ranks of democratic peace with our own efforts.

　　In the arduous three years since the surrender of Japan, we Chinese people have used the same firm resistance that we used to deal with Japanese imperialism to deal with the Kuomintang reactionary regime, which was fully supported by US imperialism. In the two years and seven months of combat, we have eliminated 4,959,400 soldiers of the reactionary faction, liberated more than 200 million people and half of China, and almost all of the enemy's American equipment has been transferred to our People's Liberation Army. It is absolutely true that the running dogs fostered by US imperialism in our China are merely transporters of our people's military force. We Chinese people believe that we have an obligation to inform friends all over the world of this valuable experience. We believe that the patriotic sentiments of the people of all countries are no less than ours. In order to resist the aggression of US imperialism, we would like to ask our fraternal nations to adopt our experience. The Chinese people have been able to win a large-scale revolutionary war with inferior weapons because of the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, which serves the people wholeheartedly, and by unswervingly fighting hard. Therefore, under the leadership of the conscious working class, unity and firm struggle will surely overcome the enemy - this is the summary of the Chinese people's experience.

　　We must stand in the democratic peace camp headed by the Soviet Union as a powerful fighting unit.

　　At the same time, we Chinese people also feel obliged to inform the aggressive camp headed by US imperialism: today, if anyone wants to arrogantly launch a new world war, we must stand in the democratic peace camp headed by the Soviet Union as a powerful fighting unit. Especially US imperialism, should have learned some lessons in our China. The traitorous running dog is only a transportation team for the people's military force - this general rule should be fully applicable to the whole world.

　　Finally, let us make it clear: today we want to uphold world peace. We Chinese people believe that internationally, we must be led by the Soviet Union, the bastion of peace, and domestically, we must be led by the conscious working class, unite as one, and fight resolutely. If we neither underestimate our own strength nor overestimate the enemy's strength, we will surely be able to overcome the danger of a new war of aggression. If the aggressors dare to launch a war, then the power of the people of the world will surely be able to defeat them, overthrow the entire capitalist imperialist system, liberate all mankind, and achieve lasting peace for the people.

　　Unite the forces of peace-loving people all over the world!

　　Eliminate war with strong unity and fighting spirit!

　　Long live the victory of people's democracy and lasting peace!

　　中国人民击败美蒋经验
  　证明必能克服战争危险
    郭沫若在世界和平大会上讲演
    【新华社北平二十七日电】出席世界和平大会中国代表团团长郭沫若对大会演讲词（编者按：本文为郭沫若先生出国赴会前留交本社的对大会演讲稿，郭先生的演讲已在布拉格和巴黎同时发表，特将原稿发表于此。）文如下：
    在第二次世界大战中，主要靠着盟邦苏联的努力，在欧洲击溃了纳粹德国，在亚洲击溃了日本，我们赢得了战争。战斗结束之后还不到四年，对德对日的和平条约还未缔结，全世界的人民都还喘息未定，帝国主义战争挑拨者们又在鼓舞着第三次大战了。
    全世界分成了鲜明的两个阵营：一边是以美帝国主义为首的侵略阵营，另一边是以社会主义国家苏联为首的民主和平阵营。
    美国的大资本家们在二次大战中获得了高度的利润，为维持其利润，竟想以金元和原子武器，垄断全世界。巨大的魔掌伸向全世界的各个角落里，不断地扩充庞大的军事基地网，资助各国的反动势力镇压人民，镇压殖民地和半殖民地的民族解放斗争，策动着各种各样的海盗式的盟约，积极地向民主和平阵营挑战。联合国宪章早被蹂躏，战争的威胁的确存在着。
    我们认识得很明白，美帝国主义是惯会以花言巧语来蒙蔽全世界的。诬蔑和平堡垒的苏联为极权国，而以“援助”的美名掩饰自己的侵略行动。但我们中国人民知道得很清楚，在我们中国首先废除了不平等条约的是苏联，在一九二六年至一九二七年，帮助我们反对帝国主义争取独立自由的是苏联，一九三七年日本帝国主义大举进侵，无条件地帮助我们抗战的国家还是苏联。美国呢？当然美国人民是我们中国人民的朋友，史迪威、卡尔逊对于我们的友谊我们至今没有忘记。但是美国的帝国主义政府，却一直都是和中国的反动军阀，买办阶级，深相结托，狡猾地进行着它的经济与文化的侵略。当我们在和日本帝国主义作战的初期，美帝国主义以大量的棉花、废铁、汽油、军火、机器供给日本帝国主义，间接主持它的侵略战争。在珍珠港事变后，美国对日宣战，但美国政府对中国的政策，却是违背史迪威将军的意志，只帮助国民党反动派，而不愿帮助人民解放军。在日本投降以后，战争已不存在，而美国政府对于国民党反动派的扶助却继续扩大，并且在我国任意驻兵，任意扩充军事基地，据美国官方所承认，在战后的直接“援助”和美国的驻华军费，总数已达四十四亿美元。此外有承认了项目，而未经宣布款项的，还未包括在内。美帝国主义以这样的大力援助反动派蒋介石，居心使中国成为美帝国主义的殖民地，并充作反苏的基地。于是在八年的抗日战争之后，便引起了空前的大规模内战。我们是受害最深的国家，因而对于美帝国主义的侵略野心也就知道得最为透澈。
    中国人民对于挑拨侵略战争的祸首，视为全人类公敌。
    今天美帝国主义在中国所扶植的反动派蒋介石已经被中国人民的武力击败了。但美帝国主义野心未戢，又转而扶助日本的法西斯残余。而在欧洲也更加嚣张地进行着反对苏联及反对全欧洲人民的勾当。北大西洋公约是极明显的新战争信号。美帝国主义所曾经加害于我们中国人民的诡计，又要加害于欧洲人民，乃至全人类了。我们中国人民对于这一挑拨帝国主义战争的祸首，不能不视为全人类的公敌。
    新战争的危机，不能让它继续存在和增长。全世界爱好和平的力量必须加紧地团结，有组织、有步骤地来克服这种危机。美帝国主义尽管嚣张跋扈，不可一世，但它的内部实包含着严重的矛盾。它靠着战争招致了畸形的繁荣，妄想重新组织战争以防止其繁荣的消失。这无异是饮鸩止渴，自掘坟墓。全世界人民的力量在战后已有长足的进展，苏联的战后五年计划正顺利进行，东欧新民主主义国家日增巩固，东方的民族解放战争正风起云涌，各帝国主义国家的人民已有广大的觉醒和团结，这一以苏联为领导的和平民主阵营，只要更加整齐步伐，不犯错误，已经有充分的力量，可以把战争危机、连同战争挑拨者本身，一道送进坟墓了。
    和平民主阵营有充分力量，把战争危机和战争挑拨者送进坟墓！
    因此，我们认为今天正是我们应该提高警觉，检阅力量的时候。我们很振奋，今天在巴黎，有这个世界拥护和平大会的召开，聚集了全世界爱好和平的人士，有工人、农民、青年、妇女的优秀代表，有权威的学者和艺术家，来共同讨论拥护和平的步骤，接受并严正地回答战争挑拨者的挑战。我们中国人民竭力支持本会，因此派遣本代表团来参加。这儿有职工、青年学生、妇女、文艺、学术、教育、新闻、宗教等各方面的代表。我们的人数虽然不多，但我们所代表的是除掉少数反动派的全中国的人民大众。我们受着人民的命令，要我们来表达我们全中国人民的意志：我们要以自己的努力，积极地、坚决地，参加民主和平的行列。
    我们中国人民在日本投降以来的艰苦的三年岁月中，用对付日本帝国主义的同样坚强抵抗，对付了美帝国主义所全力支持的国民党反动政权。在两年七个月的作战当中，我们已经消灭了反动派的军队四、九五九、四○○人，解放了两亿以上的人民和半个中国，所有敌人的美式配备，差不多全部都转移到我们人民解放军手里来了。一点也不错，美帝国主义在我们中国所培植的走狗，只是我们人民武力的运输家。这个宝贵的经验，我们中国人民认为有义务向全世界的友人们奉告。各国的人民，我们相信，爱国的情绪，决不亚于我们。为了抵御美帝国主义的侵略，要请各兄弟民族采纳我们的经验。我们中国人民是因为有了为人民全心全意服务的中国共产党在领导，不屈不挠地坚苦奋斗，以劣势的武器，终于赢得了大规模的革命战争。因此，在觉悟的工人阶级的领导之下，团结一致，坚强斗争，必能克服敌人——这便是我们中国人民的经验的总结。
    我们一定要站在以苏联为首的民主和平阵营，作为一个有力的战斗单位。
    同时我们中国人民也感觉着有义务向以美帝国主义为首的侵略阵营奉告：今天谁如要狂妄地发动新的世界战争，我们一定要站在以苏联为首的民主和平的阵营，作为一个有力的战斗单位。尤其是美帝国主义，在我们中国应该学到了一些教训了。卖国的走狗，只是人民武力的运输队——这一个公例应该完全可以适用于全世界。
    最后让我们明白地说出：今天我们要拥护世界和平，我们中国人民认为：在国际一定要以和平堡垒的苏联为领导，在国内一定要以觉悟的工人阶级为领导，团结一致，坚决斗争，不过低估计自己力量，不过高估计敌人力量，便一定可以克服新的侵略战争的危险。如果侵略者敢于发动战争，那么，全世界人民的力量就一定可以打败他们，推翻整个资本帝国主义制度，使全人类解放，获得人民的永久的和平。
    全世界爱好和平的力量团结起来
    以坚强的团结和斗志消灭战争！
    人民民主与持久和平胜利万岁！
