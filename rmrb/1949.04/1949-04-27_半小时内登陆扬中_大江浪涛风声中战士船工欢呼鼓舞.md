Xinhua News Agency, Yangtze River Front, 25th. A correspondent accompanying the East Route Army reports on the battle to liberate Yangzhong. At 10:00 PM on the 21st, two battalions of a certain regiment of the force first forcibly crossed the Yangtze River, which was seven li wide and full of turbulent waves. Within half an hour, they landed on Yangzhong and seized the beachhead. The Kuomintang bandit troops entrenched there set fire to civilian houses, attempting to resist, and enemy planes also came out to bomb. At this time, the PLA's powerful artillery immediately bombarded the enemy's front lines and depth with fierce artillery fire, covering the landing infantry's advance into the depth. Hundreds of ships of the follow-up troops braved the enemy's artillery fire and enemy planes' strafing and bombing, speeding towards the south bank through the waves. After arriving at the south bank, the ships quickly returned to the north bank to continue transporting troops across the river. For a time, countless ships on the river were like shuttles. Boatmen and soldiers meeting in the middle of the river cheered and encouraged each other amidst the wind and waves. After the follow-up troops landed on the island, they inserted themselves into the depth from both sides of Dongxing Port, cutting the defending enemy into two sections, and then swept across the north and south. Fifteen hours later, except for a remnant of the enemy that escaped across the Jiajiang River and fled south, the rest were completely annihilated. When various places were liberated, the local people gathered at the entrances of the villages to welcome the PLA. They said excitedly, "Congratulations, congratulations, you have crossed the river. We have been looking forward to you for a long time."

　　半小时内登陆扬中
  　大江浪涛风声中战士船工欢呼鼓舞
    【新华社长江前线二十五日电】东路军随军记者报道解放扬中之战。二十一日夜十时，该部某团两个营首先在宽达七里波浪汹涌的江面强渡长江，半小时内，即在扬中登陆，抢占了滩头阵地。盘踞该地的国民党匪军纵火焚烧民房，妄图抵抗，匪机亦出动轰炸。此时解放军强大炮兵即以猛烈炮火向敌人前沿与纵深轰击，掩护登陆步兵向纵深发展。后续部队的数百艘船只，则冒着敌人的炮火和敌机的扫射轰炸，波浪向南岸疾驶跟进。各船抵达南岸后，又迅速返回北岸，继续载运部队过江，一时江面无数船只有如穿梭。江心相遇的各船船工和战士们都在风声浪涛声中互相欢呼鼓舞，当后续部队登陆该洲后，即从东兴港两侧插入纵深，将守敌截成两段，然后又向南北横扫。十五小时后，除一部残敌逃过夹江南窜外，其余全部被歼。各地解放时，当地人民都群集村口欢迎解放军，他们兴奋地说：“恭喜，恭喜，你们打过江来了。我们盼望你们很久了。”
