　　Mancheng Discovers Wheat Seedling Pest
  　Government Calls for Prevention and Control
    [Chahar News] Recently, in Guocun, Dong, Xi, and Nan Sanyantong villages on the west side of the Pinghan Railway in the Fifth District of Mancheng County, a small insect has been found on wheat seedlings. It is soil-colored or reddish-black, numerous, and resembles a fire spider (fire dragon). Local farmers call it "red sand nuisance." Wheat seedlings with this kind of insect initially have white spots on the leaves, which gradually dry out. Because this type of disaster has not occurred in previous years, farmers lack prevention and control experience. The county has now issued a notice to all districts, calling on farmers to carry out prevention and control measures. The special commissioner's office has also sent a letter to the Chahar Province Xiling Farm to conduct research on prevention and control. (Gu Kedong)

　　满城发现麦苗虫害
  　政府号召防治
    【察哈尔讯】满城县五区平汉路西侧郭村，东、西、南三阎童村一带，最近在麦苗上发现一种小虫，土色或红黑色，数量很多，状似火蜘蛛（火龙）当地农民叫“红沙闹”。有了这样虫子的麦苗，最初麦叶带有白点，逐渐发干。因往年没有发生过这种灾害，农民尚无防治经验。现该县已向各区发出通知，号召农民防治，专署亦已函知察省西陵农场进行研究防治。　　　　　　　（谷克东）
