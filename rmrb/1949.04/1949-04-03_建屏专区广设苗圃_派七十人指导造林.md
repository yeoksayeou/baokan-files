Jianping Special District Widely Establishes Nurseries
Sends Seventy People to Guide Afforestation

[Chahar News] The tree planting movement in various counties of Jianping Special District has begun. The fourth, fifth, and seventh districts of Xingtang have established afforestation committees. Jialuoying and Xixiu Village have planted 3,272 trees. Tree planting has generally begun along the Hutuo River and Da Dao Canal in Pingshan. Shuinian Village has now completed 772 trees. Farmers along the Ci River in Lingshou have put forward the slogan "Plant one tree for every tree cut down" regarding the trees that were cut down in the past, and are actively planting. 10,000 trees have been planted on the canal banks of the Rongzhen Canal in Quyang. In order to solve the difficulty of a large number of tree seedlings for afforestation, nurseries have been cultivated. Nurseries of 200 mu are being sown in the restricted mountains and barren mountain areas, focusing on Jiashan, Huangshan, Zhengjiazhuang, and Dabeishan; 28 mu of nurseries have been planted on the canal banks of Rongzhen Canal. Xixiu Village, Xingtang, planted 2.5 mu of tree seedlings. The entire special district has added 70 temporary cadres detached from production for afforestation, who have been sent to various counties to lead afforestation work. In addition, attention is paid to mobilizing farmers to formulate forest protection covenants, and the government guarantees the implementation of the covenants. Xizheng Village in the fifth district of Xingtang promptly dealt with elements who destroyed trees, giving the masses confidence in tree planting. Various counties are now continuing to plant trees in large quantities.
