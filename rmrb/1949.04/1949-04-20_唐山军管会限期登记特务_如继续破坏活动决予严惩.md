　　Tangshan Military Control Commission
  　Deadline for Special Agent Registration
  　Severe Punishment for Continued Sabotage Activities
    [Tangshan Telegraph] The Tangshan Municipal Military Control Commission issued Public Notice No. 9 on the 13th, setting a deadline for the registration of reactionary party, league, and special agents. After entering the city, the Municipal Public Security Bureau immediately began the registration of reactionary party, league, and special agent elements. From the beginning to March 6th, according to incomplete statistics, 2,013 people had registered and applied for repentance, and many voluntarily handed over public property files, organizational documents, as well as firearms, radios, codes, etc. The People's Government has already granted them a broad path to self-renewal. However, some special agents are still stubbornly unrepentant, fabricating rumors, and distorting government decrees; some are downplaying their crimes, handing in only some, not all, of their weapons and documents, or not handing in the main ones; some are due to a lack of understanding of government policies; but there are still some stubbornly reactionary elements who are using various methods to conspire to carry out sabotage activities. Based on the above situation, the Municipal Public Security Bureau has specially decided to: rely on the masses, mobilize the masses to persuade, expose, accuse, and report, so that they can voluntarily register and repent. The government will, in the spirit of "curing the disease to save the patient," grant leniency. Those who register and repent, voluntarily hand over files, organizations, public property, weapons, etc., and those who contribute to the registration work will be given the opportunity to atone for their crimes as appropriate by the government. Those who downplay their crimes, evade registration, and disregard government decrees will be exposed in a timely manner and severely investigated until they truly register and thoroughly repent. Those who do not register and attempt to hide, or continue to engage in sabotage activities, will be severely investigated and dealt with by the People's Government and will not be tolerated.

　　唐山军管会
  　限期登记特务
  　如继续破坏活动决予严惩
    【唐山电】唐市军管会于十三日发布第九号布告，限期登记反动党、团特务。本市公安局，入城后，即进行反动党、团特务分子的登记工作。从开始至三月六日，据不完全统计，已有二千零十三名登记，申请悔过，不少自动交出公产档案、组织证件及枪支、电台、密码等。人民政府已予以宽大自新之路。但有些特务分子，依然执迷不悟，捏造谣言，曲解政府法令；有的避重就轻，在交武器证件时，只交一部，不交全部，或不交主要的；有的是由于不明政府政策；但仍有一部顽固反动分子利用各种方法，阴谋进行破坏活动。基于上述情况，市公安局特决定：依靠群众，发动群众劝说、揭露、告发、检举，使其自动登记悔过，政府当本治病救人之精神，给予宽大。对登记悔过、自动交出档案、组织、公产、武器等及对登记工作有贡献者政府当酌情给以将功赎罪之机会。对于避重就轻，逃避登记，玩忽政府法令者，必及时揭露，严予追究，直至其真实登记，彻底悔过为止。如有不进行登记企图隐蔽，或继续破坏活动者，人民政府定予严究法办，决不宽贷。
