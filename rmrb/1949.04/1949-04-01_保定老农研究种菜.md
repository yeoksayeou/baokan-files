　　Baoding Old Farmers Study Vegetable Cultivation
　　[Baoding News] The Baoding City Construction Bureau and the Hebei Central Agricultural Experiment Station jointly held a symposium for old farmers on the 17th of this month. Thirteen old farmers, including Wang Fengxiang, and nine government officials attended. At the meeting, Wei Kezhong, Director of the Baoding City Construction Bureau, stated that because Baoding's suburbs have little land, and government personnel and more than 100,000 citizens need vegetables, increasing vegetable production has become an important matter. The attendees then discussed vegetable planting methods. Agricultural station personnel also specifically introduced the superior cotton variety, "Si" cotton. Currently, the agricultural station has dispatched personnel to rural areas to investigate various agricultural conditions and has transported 100,000 jin of "Si" cotton and 2B cotton seeds, as well as Agricultural and Forestry No. 4 sweet potato vines, from the North China People's Government, preparing for vigorous promotion. Regarding vegetables, some seeds of large sweet peppers, lettuce, cabbage, tomatoes, etc., have been prepared, and more than 650 sprayers and more than 200 boxes of insecticidal agents have been repaired, ready for widespread use. The agricultural station's livestock clinic was established a few days ago, only charging for medicine costs and waiving service fees for treating livestock for the masses.

　　保定老农研究种菜
    【保定讯】保定市建设局与冀中农业试验场，本月十七日联合召开老农座谈会。到老农王奉祥等十三人，及机关干部九人。会上市建设局长魏克忠谈到保定市郊因为土地少，且机关人员、十余万市民，都需要菜蔬吃，菜蔬增产也成为一件重要的事情了。到会人员随即座谈了菜蔬的种植方法，农场人员还特别介绍了优良棉种——斯字棉。现农场已派员下乡调查农业方面的各种情况，并已从华北人民政府运来十万斤斯字棉、二Ｂ棉种，及农林四号红薯秧，准备大力推广。在菜蔬方面：已备好一部份大甜青椒、莴苣、洋白菜、西红柿等种籽，且修好六百五十余架喷雾器，二百余箱治虫药剂，以备广泛实用。农场牲畜诊疗所已于日前成立，只收药价，免收手续费为群众治牲口。
