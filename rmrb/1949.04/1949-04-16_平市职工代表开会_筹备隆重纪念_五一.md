    [Report from this newspaper] In order to welcome the "May Day" Labor Day, the Propaganda Department of the City Federation of Trade Unions Preparatory Committee yesterday (the 15th) convened representatives of trade unions from 28 units including Hebei Electric Power Company, Mentougou Coal Mine Company, 70th Arsenal, and Postal Administration to discuss ways to grandly commemorate "May Day". Comrade Zeng Ping spoke first, requesting representatives of each unit to return to the factory and deeply publicize the significance of commemorating "May Day" among the workers. Afterwards, everyone discussed commemorative methods and decided to hold a grand meeting for commemoration, followed by a masquerade parade. They will also produce wall newspapers and mimeographed special publications, with content including production, learning, assisting in the takeover, as well as life reports and literary works. It is suggested that the Beiping Broadcasting Station increase the "May Day" program from the 20th. Finally, representatives of the trade unions of each factory were asked to go back and actively prepare and formulate plans.
