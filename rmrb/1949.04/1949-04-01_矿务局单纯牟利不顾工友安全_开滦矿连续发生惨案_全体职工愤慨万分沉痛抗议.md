(Our newspaper's Tangshan dispatch) In the three months since the liberation of Kailuan Tangshan Mine, the Mining Bureau has only sought unilateral profit, skimping on and ignoring essential safety equipment in the mines. As a result, tragic incidents involving damaged machinery and worker injuries and deaths have occurred repeatedly. This situation has provoked extreme anger among the employees.

As early as 6:00 AM on January 15th, in the "9974" area of the 17.5th stone gate of the ninth roadway underground, ten workers, including Zhao Kai, were injured due to the presence of poisonous gas. The incident unfolded as follows: There was an old shaft at the 17.5th stone gate, which had been sealed off due to a fire in the past. This shaft was filled with poisonous gas. There was a large piece of coal near the old shaft that should have been left as a barrier, but the Mining Bureau, in order to extract this coal, disregarded the workers' safety and allowed the poisonous gas from the old shaft to seep through, injuring the workers. From the 21st to the 23rd, 26th, and 27th of this month, tragedies occurred continuously. In the "9974" and "9975" areas of the 17.5th stone gate of the ninth roadway, poisonous gas appeared five times in a row, injuring 93 workers. Specifically: twice on the 21st, injuring 39; once on the 23rd, injuring 28; once on the 26th, injuring 24; and again on the 27th, injuring 2. In total, as many as 103 workers were injured.

At 6:00 AM on February 17th, in the "1920" area of the second stone gate of the eleventh roadway underground, because the Mining Bureau saved labor costs by canceling the special worker who used to look after the ventilator, replacing him with an outside worker. When the outside worker went off duty, he turned off the ventilator. It would be turned on again once the next worker arrived. During the change over the ventilator would be stopped for two hours, and as a result, a fire broke out, burning to death worker Guan Heming and injuring 16 employees including Hu Xuting. The workers said: If the underground ventilator had been running continuously, the fire would not have occurred, or would have been much smaller.

Another very dangerous incident occurred: Also, at 7:00 AM on the 27th of this month, the steel cable of the large cage used to transport coal and people up and down the mine shaft broke, completely damaging the cage and the coal cars inside. After the coal cars were transported up, it was supposed to transport the workers. If it had been a few minutes later, who knows how many more workers would have suffered! The steel cable on this cage was installed on September 13, 1946, with a warranty period of ten months, but the Mining Bureau used it for two years and six months. Its sole pursuit of unilateral profit, completely disregarding the necessary safety of employees at work, is truly infuriating!

After each tragedy, the mine's employees have negotiated with the Mining Bureau, demanding minimal improvements, but to no avail. Especially after the tragedies on the 21st and 23rd of this month, all employees could no longer tolerate this cruel treatment. At the inaugural meeting of the temporary employee representative assembly on the 24th, they unanimously and sorrowfully stated: "In the past, under the rule of the Japanese devils and the Kuomintang, we workers endured decades of silent resentment. Today, Tangshan is liberated, and Chairman Mao's policy of 'labor-capital mutual benefit' is to be implemented. It is unacceptable for the capitalists to only care about profits, sacrifice the lives and interests of workers, and treat us like cattle and horses!" Others said: "When our workers are injured by the Mining Bureau and go to the Kailuan Hospital, there are very few doctors and nurses in the wards, not to mention medicine. The injured workers have painfully scratched their chests, which shows that the mine is very indifferent to the injured workers." At that time, they unanimously demanded that a protest be lodged with the Mining Bureau. But before they could finish speaking, the events of the 26th and 27th occurred. On the 29th, the mine's temporary employee representative assembly formally submitted a letter of protest to the Mining Bureau, demanding:

(1) Investigate the truth, hold those responsible accountable, and report the facts to the employee representative assembly.

(2) Conduct a thorough investigation of all safety equipment above and below the mine within a time limit, and immediately repair and install it to ensure that similar incidents do not occur in the future.

(3) Publicly acknowledge the mistakes and apologize to all employees.

(4) Provide the appropriate compensation to the employees who have been injured in the past, based on the extent of their injuries. And improve the treatment of injured workers during their hospitalization and recuperation.

### 矿务局单纯牟利不顾工友安全　开滦矿连续发生惨案  全体职工愤慨万分沉痛抗议

　　矿务局单纯牟利不顾工友安全
  　开滦矿连续发生惨案
    全体职工愤慨万分沉痛抗议
    【本报唐山讯】开滦唐山矿从解放到现在的三个多月中间，矿务局只图单方面牟利，对于矿井里十分必要的安全设备，省工减料，毫不理会；因此，损坏机器，死伤工友的惨剧不断发生。这种事情，已引起了职工们的极度震怒。
    还是一月十五日上午六点钟的时候，在井下九道行十七道半石门“九九七四”处，因为出现毒气，曾损伤了工友赵凯等十个人。经过是：十七道半有一个老塘，从前因起火被封闭起来，里面便装满了毒气，老塘附近有一大块煤，本应留挡，但矿务局为了取这块煤，竟不顾工人的安全，把老塘里的毒气透过来，薰伤了工人。到本月二十一、二十三、二十六、二十七四天中间，惨剧更是不断的发生；在九道行十七道半石门“九九七四”、“九九七五”两处，毒气一连出现了五次，薰伤了工友九十三名。计：二十一日两次，薰伤三十九名；二十三日一次，薰伤二十八名；二十六日一次，薰伤二十四名；二十七日又薰伤两名。前后共被薰伤的工友，竟达一百零三名之多。
    二月十七日上午六点钟，在井下十一道行二道石门“一九二○”处，还曾因为矿务局节省人工，把从前专门看管风车的里工取消，换上外工看管，外工一下班，就把风车关上，等接班的来了再开，接换中间风车就要停顿两个钟头，结果发生了火灾，烧死工友关鹤鸣一名，烧伤职工胡旭庭等十六名。工人说：如果井下的风车不停地开着，就不会发生火灾，就是发生，也小得多。
    还有一件非常危险的事：也是在本月二十七日上午七点钟的时候，矿井用来上下送煤和送人的大罐，钢绳子折断，把罐子与罐内的运煤车完全跌坏了。运煤车运上去以后，就该运送工人的，如再迟几分钟，便不知又有多少工人遭殃！考查这个罐上的钢绳子，乃是一九四六年九月十三日装上去的，保险期为十个月，但矿务局却用了两年零六个月，其只图单方面牟利，根本不顾职工工作中必要的安全，实令人愤慨！
    该矿职工在每一惨剧后，都曾向矿务局交涉，要求做起码的改善，但都没有什么效果。尤其是在本月二十一、二十三两天的惨剧发生以后，全体职工，再也不能忍受这种残忍的待遇了，便在二十四日的职工临时代表会的成立大会上，一致沉痛的表示：“过去在日本鬼子与国民党的统治下，我们工人忍气吞声的过了几十年；今天唐山解放了，要实行毛主席的‘劳资两利’的政策，资方只图利润，牺牲工人生命和利益，拿我们当牛马看待是不行的！”还有的说：“矿务局使我们工人受了伤，工友们到了开滦医院，病房里大夫和护士很少，药品更不能谈了，受伤的工友曾痛苦的抓伤了胸口，这表现矿方对受伤的工友，是很不关心的。”当时便一致要求向矿务局提出抗议；但话犹未了：又发生了二十六、二十七两天的事件，二十九日，该矿职工临时代表会，向矿务局正式提出了抗议书；要求：
    （一）清查真相，追究责任，据实报导到职工代表会。
    （二）限期澈查矿方所有之井上井下一切安全设备，立即予以修整装置，保证今后不再发生类似事件。
    （三）公开承认错误，并向全体职工道歉。
    （四）对历次受伤之职工，根据伤情，予以应有的抚恤。并改善受伤工友住院调养等待遇。
