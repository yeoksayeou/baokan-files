Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 22nd: Moscow dispatch: The Labor News published a dispatch by its reporter describing the new life in the East German countryside, stating: Spring plowing in the Soviet-occupied zone of Germany is proceeding with full force. Farmers' mutual aid committees and machine rental stations provide extensive support to farmers, helping them further increase production. The task of East German farmers is to reach the pre-war average harvest level within two years. From 1946 to 1948, the harvest volume in East Germany had a significant increase. Generally speaking, the pre-war level can be reached in five years, while after the First World War, it took until 1938, that is, about twenty years, to restore the pre-war level.

　　The land reform has dramatically changed the countryside in the Soviet-occupied zone of Germany. Farmers have replaced landlords and Junker aristocrats as the main force. They have obtained land through democratic reforms, and they themselves are the main pillar of democracy in the countryside. East Germany has established state-owned large farms for producing grains and seeds, and raising cattle. There are no more landlords' farms in East Germany. Among those who obtained land, there were about 120,000 agricultural workers and landless poor, 113,000 households with little land, and about 34,000 immigrant families. A total of more than 500,000 families obtained land, including some urban workers. In addition to land, farmers also received equipment, cattle, and farm buildings confiscated from the landlords. The farmers' mutual aid committees established during the land reform have obtained many repair shops, power plants, and machines at their disposal. They have become powerful farmers' organizations, and now these committees have about 500,000 members. The food situation in the Soviet zone is constantly improving. On March 1st, the rations of the working people in some industries (about two million people) in the Soviet-occupied zone were greatly increased. Immigrants especially feel the benefits of the land reform. At least 300,000 immigrants (84,000 households) have settled down in the Soviet-occupied zone.

　　The democratic land reform in the Soviet-occupied zone eliminated the reactionary landlord class. However, rich peasants remain (about 60,000 farms). There are also small private properties and small production. Therefore, the class struggle in the countryside has not disappeared. On the contrary, this struggle has become more acute. The rich peasants are unwilling to accept the fact that the poor peasants united in the farmers' mutual aid committees are constantly breaking away from their "leadership." On the contrary, they are trying to infiltrate the leading organs of these committees, trying to rule the countryside through them. The election of new leading organs of the farmers' mutual aid committees is currently underway under conditions of sharp class struggle. The democratic forces in the German countryside are now conducting a large-scale struggle to cleanse the rich peasant elements from the mutual aid committees and machine rental stations and turn them into truly democratizing institutions in the countryside. Seventy percent of the newly elected executive committee members of the Mecklenburg State Farmers' Mutual Aid Committee are new faces. This struggle is led by the German Socialist Unity Party, which enjoys the sympathy of the new farmers and the support of the rapidly growing democratic forces in the new German countryside.

　　东德农村新生活
  　劳动报记者报导
    【新华社北平二十二日电】莫斯科讯：此间劳动报发表该报记者描述德国东部农村新生活的通讯称：德国苏占区的春耕，正在全力进行中。农民互助委员会和机器租借站，给予农民广泛的支持，帮助他们更进一步地提高生产量。东德农民的任务是：在两年中达到战前的平均收获水平。在一九四六年到一九四八年期间，东德的收获量曾有显著的上升。整个地说来，在五年中就可以达到战前的水平，而在第一次大战以后，直到一九三八年，即是说，经过了大约二十年，才恢复战前的水平。
    土地改革剧烈地改变了德境苏占区的农村。农民代替了地主和容克贵族而占主要地位，他们由于民主改革得到了土地，他们自己就是民主在农村中的主要支柱。东德已建立了属于国家的大农庄，生产谷物和种子，蓄养牛群。东德已经没有地主的农庄，在得到土地者中间，有约十二万户农业工人和无地贫民，十一万三千少地户，和约三万四千家移民。得到土地的共五十余万家，其中包括某些城市工人。除土地以外，农民还得到从地主那里没收来的装备、牛群和农场建筑。在土地改革时建立起来的农民互助委员会，得到了很多修理所、动力厂和机器供其支配，它已变成了有力的农民组织，现在这些委员会约有五十万会员。苏战区中的粮食情况在不断改进中。三月一日，苏占区中某些行业的劳动人民（约两百万人）的配给量曾大大提高。移民们特别感到土地改革的好处。苏占区中至少已有三十万移民（八万四千户）安居下来。
    苏占区的民主土地改革消除了反动的地主阶级，但是，富农们留了下来（约有六万家农场）。还有着小的私有财产和小生产，因此，在农村中的阶级斗争并没有消失。相反，这个斗争已更形尖锐。富农们对于下述的事实不愿意服输，即：联合在农民互助委员会中的贫农正不断脱出他们的“领导”。反之，他们还试图潜入这些委员会的指导机关，试图经过那里来统治农村。农民互助委员会新指导机关的选举，刻正在尖锐阶级斗争的条件下进行。德国农村中的民主力量，现在正进行大规模的斗争，以清洗互助委员会和机器租借站中的富农分子，并把它们变成真正使农村民主化的机构。梅格棱堡州农民互助委员会新选出的执委中有百分之七十都是新人。这个斗争是由德国统一社会党领导的，该党享有新农民的同情和新德国农村中迅速增长起来的民主力量的支持。
