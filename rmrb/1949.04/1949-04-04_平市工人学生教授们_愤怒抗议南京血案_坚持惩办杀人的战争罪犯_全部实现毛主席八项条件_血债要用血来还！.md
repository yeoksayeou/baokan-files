　　Beiping Workers, Students, and Professors
　　Angrily Protest the Nanjing Massacre
    Insist on Punishing the Murderous War Criminals, Fully Implement Chairman Mao's Eight Conditions
    Blood Debt Must Be Paid in Blood!
    [Special Dispatch from This Newspaper] After the news came that the Kuomintang reactionaries in Nanjing had beaten to death and injured more than a hundred students who were demanding genuine peace, workers from the Beiping Telecommunications Bureau, the Dongzhimen Water Company, the 70th Arsenal, the First and Eighth Ordnance Repair Shops, in addition to expressing their condolences to the students of Nanjing universities and pledging to be their backing, unanimously exposed the fake peace of the Nanjing reactionary traitorous government and demanded that the murderers be severely punished. Zhu Shidi, a worker at the long-distance station of the Telecommunications Bureau, said: "The Kuomintang talks about peace, peace, but in reality, it is killing, killing." Tang Zhixue, a technician in the tool room of the 70th Arsenal, said: "This fully proves that the Nanjing reactionary government's peace is fake." Bai Zhenquan, a fitter in the fitter section of the Eighth Ordnance Repair Shop, said: "We are extremely angry about the Nanjing reactionary government's massacre of students. We will absolutely work hard in production and resolutely carry the revolution through to the end." The workers all shouted loudly: "The People's Liberation Army must cross the Yangtze River, capture the murderous executioners alive, capture the war criminals alive, and thoroughly sweep away the man-eating beast group."

    [Another Dispatch] The news of the Nanjing massacre aroused infinite anger among professors and students in Beiping.
    The student self-government association of Peking University protested, believing that this bloody massacre proved that the so-called "peace" of the Kuomintang reactionaries was a thorough conspiracy, and proved how the people under the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang longed to break away from the dark reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, longed for peace, and how bravely they were fighting for genuine peace. The blood debt of "April 1st" must be written on the account of the war criminals who must be severely punished. Upon hearing of this atrocity by the Kuomintang reactionary traitorous government, Tsinghua students immediately posted posters stating: "If the reactionaries are not eliminated for even one day, this bloody behavior will not end for even one day!" Professors Fei Xiaotong and Li Guangtian, in addition to expressing their anger at the Kuomintang's consistent brutal means, pointed out: "This is a manifestation of the reactionaries' lack of sincerity in negotiation. The negotiations in Beiping must be resolutely based on Chairman Mao's eight conditions, and not relax a single step." Teachers and students from the political science departments of Yenching University, Peking University, and Tsinghua University were holding a joint party. At the meeting, thirteen professors and students, including Qian Duansheng and Lou Bangyan, unanimously agreed that in addition to expressing support and condolences to the students in Nanjing, they would pledge to support with action and shatter the fake peace. The student self-government association also issued a protest letter.
    The self-government association of Normal University and the self-government association of the Railway Management College issued equally indignant protest letters, demanding blood for blood and severe punishment of the murderers. Organizations such as the Torch Society and the Transformation Society of Yenching University, as well as the Department of Journalism, posted wall newspapers one after another, supporting the just and heroic actions of the students in Nanjing.
    A student from the Normal University Affiliated High School said with grief and indignation: "Reading this terrifying news, every word and every needle pricked my heart. The mask of fake peace of the reactionaries has been torn apart, revealing broken swords and spears. They harmed our innocent young companions, which is to add a new hatred to our old hatred. We will raise our fists together, and the slogan of supporting genuine peace will be shouted even louder. The murderous executioners who are dragging out their last breath, your doomsday has arrived. One more shot fired means one more debt. Do not forget that blood debts must be paid in blood." A student from Huiwen Middle School said: "The Kuomintang reactionaries are pretending to be pious in front but wielding knives behind their backs, what kind of tricks are they playing to deceive people." The students of Beiping have suffered a bloody lesson and will never be fooled again, as the students of the First and Second Boys' Middle Schools said in unison: "We must not be deceived by it (referring to the Kuomintang reactionary traitorous government). Its trick of fake peace has now been exposed by its bloody hands." In addition, teachers and students from the Railway Management College, Municipal First Middle School, Municipal Second Middle School, and Huiwen Middle School all had similar actions and expressions after the massacre occurred.

　　平市工人学生教授们
  　愤怒抗议南京血案
    坚持惩办杀人的战争罪犯　全部实现毛主席八项条件
    血债要用血来还！
    【本报特讯】南京国民党反动派打死打伤一百多名要求真和平的学生的消息传来后，平市电讯局、东直门自来水公司、七十兵工厂、第一和第八修械所等工厂职工，除对南京各大学学生表示慰问并誓作后盾外，一致揭露南京反动卖国政府的假和平，要求严惩杀人凶犯。电讯局长途台工人朱士第说：“国民党嘴说和平和平，实在是杀人杀人。”七十兵工厂工具室技工唐志学说：“这十足证明南京反动政府的和平是假的。”第八修械所钳工部工人白振全说：“南京反动政府屠杀学生，我们心里万分愤怒，我们绝对努力生产，坚决把革命进行到底”。工人们都大声要求地说：“解放军一定要打过长江去，活捉杀人的刽子手，活捉战争罪犯，彻底扫清吃人的野兽群。”（七十兵工厂、东直门自来水公司、电讯局、第八修械所工人通讯组、关欣）
    【又讯】南京惨案的消息引起了平市教授学生无限的愤怒。
    北京大学学生自治会的抗议，认为这一血腥的屠杀证明了国民党反动派所谓“和平”是一种地道的阴谋，证明了国民党反动统治下的人民是怎样渴求脱离国民党反动黑暗统治，渴求和平，而又是怎样英勇地为真和平而斗争。“四一”的血债必须写在一定要严惩的战犯的帐上。清华同学一听到国民党反动卖国政府的这一暴行，马上贴出海报认为：“反动派一日不消灭，这血腥的行为一日不会终止！”费孝通，李广田教授除对国民党一贯的残暴手段表示愤怒外，并指出：“这是反动派对秤没有诚意的表示。在北平进行的谈判，非要坚决根据毛主席的八项条件不可，绝不能放松一步。”燕京大学，北京大学，清华大学三校政治系师生正举行联欢会，会上钱端升，楼邦彦等十三教授和同学，一致通过除对南京同学表示支援和慰问外，誓以行动来支援，粉碎假和平。学生自治会也发出了抗议书。
    师范大学自治会，铁道管理学院自治会，发出了同样愤慨的抗议书，要求血债血还，严惩凶手。燕京大学火炬社，改造社等社团及新闻系等纷纷贴出壁报，支持南京同学的正义英勇行动。
    师大附中同学会的一个同学悲愤地说：“读到这恐怖的消息，一字一针的刺痛了我的心，反动派假和平的面具破了，露出了残破的刀枪剑戟，他害了我们无辜的青年同伴，也就是把一笔新仇加在我们的旧恨上，我们一齐举起拳头，拥护真和平的口号会喊得更响，苟延残喘的杀人刽子手，你们的末日到了，多放一枪，就多一笔债，不要忘了血债是要血还的。”汇文中学的一个学生说：“国民党反动派前面吃斋，后面动刀，耍他妈的什么把戏骗人。”北平学生是遭受过血的教训，再也不会上当的了，正如男一中、二中的同学异口同声所说：“我们不要受它（指国民党反动卖国政府）的骗啊，它的假和平的诡计现在被它的血手所揭穿了。”此外，铁道管理学院、市立一中、市立二中、汇文中学的师生在惨案发生后均有类似的行动和表示。
