　　Sincere and Enthusiastic Taiyuan People
  　Bravely Assist the People's Liberation Army in Combat
    [Taiyuan, 25th Dispatch] Reporters Yuan Mingruan and Liu Guanwen report: The people of Taiyuan welcomed the People's Liberation Army with sincerity and enthusiasm, and bravely assisted the People's Liberation Army in combat. On April 20th, when the People's Liberation Army chasing the enemy arrived at the Jinhua Cigarette Factory in the south of the city, the factory employees, regardless of the artillery fire, busily boiled water for the troops. When the troops continued to advance and had no guide, they very kindly said to the boiler room worker, Li Shuangxi, "How about we discuss something?" When the worker Li Shuangxi knew that he was being asked to lead the way, he immediately patted the comrade of the troops on the shoulder and said, "No problem, let's go!" Wang Sanxi, an employee of the boiler room of the East Factory (Jinhua Cigarette Factory divided into East and West Factories), carried artillery shells to the front line for three days. When the People's Liberation Army entered the city and the war had not yet ended, citizens such as Liu Wenyu, who lived at No. 100 Nanxiaobi, put up red slogans saying "Long Live Chairman Mao!" and "Long Live the People's Liberation Army!" With infinite excitement, they watched their own troops advance victoriously from in front of their doors. Many citizens brought boiled water for the soldiers to drink, but the soldiers, eager to pursue the enemy, smiled and declined. The citizens said excitedly, "We've been waiting for you today! Waiting for you tomorrow! It's not easy to have you here, look how you're running, covered in sweat, and you won't even drink a sip of water!" There is a saying on the streets now: "When the People's Liberation Army fights, they are so fierce against the enemy. After coming in, they are so kind to the people. This is really our own good army." When war criminals Wang Jingguo, Sun Chu, etc. were escorted through the streets, the citizens gnashed their teeth and discussed, "These utterly bad guys have been captured alive. Only the People's Liberation Army makes the people feel comfortable and able to breathe." Some people even inquired about the whereabouts of the secret service chiefs Liang Huazhi and Yang Zhengji. They said, "These guys should be severely punished."

　　真诚热情的太原人民
  　英勇协助解放军作战
    【太原二十五日电】记者袁明阮、刘贯文报导：太原人民以真诚热情欢迎人民解放军，并勇敢协助解放军作战。四月二十号，追击敌人的人民解放军到达城南晋华卷烟厂后，该厂员工不顾炮火，忙给部队烧水。当部队继续前进没有向导，非常和气的给锅炉房工人李双喜说：“咱们商量个事情好不好？”当工人李双喜知道是请他引路后，立即拍着部队同志的肩膀说：“没关系，走！”东厂（晋华卷烟分东西二厂）锅炉房职工王三喜向火线扛炮弹三天。当解放军攻入城内战争尚未结束的时候，住在南肖壁一百号的市民刘文玉等，就把“毛主席万岁！”“人民解放军万岁！”红色标语贴出来了，他们以无限兴奋的心情，望着自己的队伍，从自己的门前胜利前进。许多市民端着开水给战士们喝，战士们因为急着追击敌人，笑着表示谢绝。市民很激动的说：“今天盼你们！明天盼你们！好容易把你们盼来了，你看你们跑的满头是汗，连一口水也不喝！”现在街头上有一种反映：“解放军打起来，对敌人是那么厉害。进来以后对老百姓又是这么和气，这真是咱们自己的好队伍。”当战犯王靖国、孙楚等被押着在街上经过的时候，市民们莫不咬牙切齿，纷纷议论说：“这些坏透了的家伙，把他们活捉着了。只有人民解放军才叫人民舒服吐口气”。有些人并且打听特务头子梁化之与杨贞吉的下落。他们说：“这些家伙都应该狠狠的惩办。”
