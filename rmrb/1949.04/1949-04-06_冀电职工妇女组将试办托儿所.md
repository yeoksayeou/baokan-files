　　Jidian Workers' Women's Group
　　Will Pilot Nursery
　　[Ping City News] The Women's Group of the Preparatory Committee of the Jibei Electric Power Company Workers is established after the dissolution of the Women's Federation Preparatory Committee on March 8th. After two meetings and discussions, they want to pilot a daytime nursery and sell household handicraft products on commission, and prepare to fight for the benefits that female colleagues deserve. These tasks are already underway. The announcement for the sale of household industrial products has been issued, and everyone is welcome to participate at will. Due to lack of experience in piloting the nursery, the Women's Group plans to first visit various nurseries in the city, and on the other hand, investigate the company's internal needs and plan equipment matters. As for striving for the benefits they deserve, the first is to strive for equal benefits for male and female colleagues within the company. We hope that all female colleagues will provide more opinions so that everyone is satisfied.

　　冀电职工妇女组
    将试办托儿所
    【平市讯】冀北电力公司职工筹委会妇女组是妇女联谊会筹备会在三八解散以后才成立起来的。经过两次开会讨论，想试办白日托儿所，及家庭手工业产品代售，并准备为女同事们争取应得的福利。这几项工作，已在开始进行。代售家庭工业品的布告已经出来，大家可以随意来参加。试办托儿所因为缺乏经验，所以准备一方面由妇女组先进行参观本市各托儿所，另一方面，调查公司内部需要及筹划设备事宜。至于争取应得福利，首先是争取公司内男女同事福利相等，其他请全体女同事们多多提供意见，希望能做到人人满意
