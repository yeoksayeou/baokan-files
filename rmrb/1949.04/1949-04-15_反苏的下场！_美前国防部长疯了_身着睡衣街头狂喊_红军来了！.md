　　The Consequences of Anti-Sovietism!
  　Former U.S. Defense Secretary Goes Mad
    Runs Through Streets in Pajamas Shouting "The Red Army is Coming!"
    [Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 13th Dispatch] TASS, New York Dispatch: American columnist Pearson stated in his customary Sunday evening broadcast that former U.S. Defense Secretary Forrestal has completely gone mad and has been confined to the Bethesda Naval Hospital. Pearson said, "Not long ago, Forrestal suffered from a nervous breakdown and was recuperating at Harriman's home in Florida." According to Pearson's broadcast, Forrestal was driven mad by the paranoid idea of a Soviet invasion of the United States. Last Monday night, when a fire alarm sounded outside the Harriman residence, Forrestal hurriedly ran into the street in his pajamas, shouting wildly that the Red Army was coming. His friends forced him to accept emergency treatment and then flew him to the Bethesda Naval Hospital in Maryland. Pearson said, "Although Forrestal's friends agreed to keep this matter absolutely secret, he believes that the American people have the right to know that Forrestal was already mentally unstable during his tenure as Secretary of Defense." Pearson also said that Truman may have known about this situation and hinted that a review should be conducted of the important decisions made by the U.S. military under Forrestal's supervision.
    Associated Press reporters are still covering up Forrestal's scandal. A dispatch from the 12th quoted doctors as saying that his madness was "occupational fatigue."

　　反苏的下场！
  　美前国防部长疯了
    身着睡衣街头狂喊“红军来了！”
    【新华社北平十三日电】塔斯社纽约讯：美国专栏作家皮尔逊在他的照例的星期日晚广播中称：前任美国防部长福莱斯特尔完全陷于疯狂状态，已被关在贝兹达海军医院中。皮尔逊说：“不久以前福莱斯特尔曾患神经错乱症，住在佛罗里达州哈里曼的家里休养。”根据皮尔逊的广播，福莱斯特尔是给苏联进攻美国这种杯弓蛇影的观念弄得发疯的。在上星期一晚，当哈里曼住宅外面响起火警的时候，福莱斯特尔急急忙忙地穿着睡衣，就跑到街上，狂呼红军来了。他的朋友们强制他接受紧急的诊治，随后又用飞机把他送到马里兰州的贝兹达海军医院。皮尔逊说：“虽然福莱斯特尔的朋友们约定对于这件事情要绝对保守秘密，但是他认为美国人民有权知道福莱斯特尔在国防部长任内就已经神经失常了”。皮尔逊又说：杜鲁门可能知道这种情形，并暗示应对美国军事机关在福莱斯特尔主管下所作的重要决定，予以审查。
    美联社记者还在掩盖福莱斯特尔的丑态，该社十二日消息引医生的话，说他的发疯是“职业性疲劳症”。
