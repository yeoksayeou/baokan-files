　　Repairing a Section of the People's Railway
    —On the Project of the Handan-Fengfeng Section of the Pinghan Railway

　　On March 27th, a railway section of more than 40 kilometers from Fengfeng to Handan was completely repaired. This project was completed by an engineering team like this: they had a total of 480 people, most of the cadres and staff among them were farmer cadres from the Taihang Mountains. Many of them had never even seen a train, let alone engineering technology. Among them, except for a technician who was in charge of using instruments to determine the center line, the rest were learning while doing. With high enthusiasm and hard work, an 18-year-old signalman became an excellent surveyor, and farmer cadres became engineering team leaders for building bridges and laying tracks. They had previously chiseled through solid rock and leveled high and low gullies to build the Handan-Shexian Railway more than a year ago. This time, in repairing the Handan-Fengfeng section, this engineering team further demonstrated their creativity and hard-working style. The first difficulty they encountered was the lack of materials: there were no flat cars for transportation, and although there were large pieces such as herringbone and cross-shaped turnouts, there was a lack of various parts such as base plates and rail clips. The road needed to pass through two wide rivers, the Niu River and the Deng River, and several small rivers and ditches. Some bridges had been demolished or damaged long ago. They had no angle iron or plate iron, nor a single riveter; but the difficulties did not overwhelm their enthusiasm. If there were no flat cars, they would build their own. They studied with technicians from rural factories several times, first using scrap rails as raw materials to add pig iron to cast large materials for the wheels, then using the crucible method to infiltrate steel slag and forge durable wheels. Then steel rails were used as the axle body, with four sleepers as the frame, covered with iron plates. This car could carry 20 steel rails weighing 14,000 catties. The "homemade flat car" was successfully manufactured, solving the major difficulty of construction and transportation. Turnout parts were originally difficult to manufacture outside of large-scale steel mills, but under the tenacious will of the workers to overcome difficulties, they searched for old parts as standards while combining the experience of veteran railway workers. First, various models of sand casting were used to make large materials, and then they were hammered into various shapes. For this purpose, different styles of anvils and hammers were forged first, and finally square, round, and long through holes were drilled. During the forging process, sometimes the entire piece needed to be modified and remade because one part's dimensions were not up to standard. It was relatively slow at the beginning, but in the end, they could make four to five "tiger claws" a day. In this way, manual tools replaced machine products, and 20 manual furnaces produced 20 sets of turnouts (each set including 29 styles and 180 parts) in one month, so that each station on the entire line had at least two sets of turnouts for use. Because of the difficulty of riveting on the bridges, they hired three riveters and cooperated with 20 manual blacksmiths, learning while working, thus replacing the work originally planned for 30 riveters. To renovate the disassembled steel beams, angle iron and plate iron were needed. They took channel steel from scrap iron. Some needed to be sawn open, and some needed to be hammered open with hammers that vibrated the eardrums. With the hard work of the workers putting in more sweat and more processing, the difficulties were finally overcome, creating the necessary conditions for the restoration.

    The Taihang Zixin Team made great contributions to earth and stone works during the rush repair of the Handan-Shexian section. This time, they were almost entirely responsible for earthwork transportation. Because the carrying capacity of the transportation vehicles was limited and the number was insufficient, the further the road was repaired, the more difficult it became to supply materials. Under the slogan of "Expressing Zixin through practical actions," they launched a competition of "People rest, but vehicles don't," transporting day and night in two shifts. This lasted for 20 days. They forgot their fatigue and ensured the timely supply of materials, allowing the track laying to proceed smoothly. In addition to receiving material rewards, their greatest gain was that labor transformed them, and they were indeed reborn.

    Another support army that enabled the rapid completion of the construction plan was the peasant masses in the Handan, Feixiang, Cheng'an, and Cixian areas. The sleepers for the Handan-Fengfeng section were originally intended for the Handan-Guantao Road. This time, it was decided to transport more than 20 million catties to Handan. Under the enthusiasm of the peasants who were looking forward to the growth of their own railway, they transported them trip after trip with ox and donkey carts, never even stopping during the Lunar New Year, and finally completed the transportation in two weeks. They also continuously sent the iron rail parts that had been stored for several years to the Railway Bureau. A certain village in Cheng'an-Cixian sent 20 buried steel rails, and an old lady from Zhongliulin Village in the first district of Handan personally sent 14 screws in a small bamboo basket to the comrades of the Railway Bureau. Wood was very scarce in this area because it had been burned by the Japanese invaders, but with the enthusiastic support of the peasants, signal poles and bridge materials were guaranteed to be supplied in full quantities.

    The people's railway has finally been repaired! It began to answer the people's hopes for it from April 2, 1949.

　　修复一段人民铁路
    —记平汉路邯郸峰峰段的工程
    三月二十七日，峰峰至邯郸段一条四十余公里的铁路，完全修复了。这段工程，是由这样一支工程队完成的：他们一共四百八十人，其中的干部和职员大都是来自太行山的农民干部，有不少人连火车也没见过，对工程技术更谈不到了。他们中间，除一位掌仪器定中线的技师外，其余都是一边做一边学，在高度的热情和努力学习下，十八岁的通讯员变成了优秀的测量员，农民干部变成了修桥钉道的工程队长，他们曾凿通了坚厚的山岩，修平了高凹的沟壑，在一年多以前，修成了邯涉铁路。这次修复邯峰段、这支工程队更发挥了他们的创造性和艰苦作风。他们遇到的第一个困难是材料缺乏：运输上没有平车，道叉虽有人字十字等大件，但是垫板、道掌等各种零件都很缺乏。该路需通过牛等两条宽河与若干小河与水沟，有些桥早拆掉或损坏了。他们没有三角铁的板铁，也没有一个铆合工人；但是困难没有压倒他们的热情，没有平车自己造。他们同农村工厂的技工数度研究，先用废轨作原料加灰生铁翻出车轮的大料，然后用蒙炉法渗钢渣，锻出耐用的轮子，再以钢轨作轴身，上面四根枕木作架，铺上铁板，这个车能载二十根钢轨重一万四千斤，“土平车”制造成功了，解决了修筑运输的重大困难。叉道零件，本是大规模炼钢厂以外难以制造的，但职工们在排除困难的坚韧意志下，一面搜罗旧件作标准；一面结合了多年铁路老工人的经验；先用各种模型的翻砂制成大料，然后分别的再用铁锤打成各种形式。为此又先锻出了不同式样的砧锤，最后钻出方、圆、长的透眼。打制过程中有时因一处尺寸凹凸标准不对，而又需全件改装重制，开始比较迟慢，但到最后如“虎爪”却能一天制到四件至五件。就这样以手工工具代替了机器产品，二十盘手工炉一月时间造出了二十付（每付包括二十九种式样、一百八十个零件）道叉，使全路每站均有了至低两付道叉使用，桥梁上因铆工困难，他们请到了三位铆工，配合以二十名手工铁匠，一面学习一面工作，这样代替了原计划三十个铆工的工作。要把拆卸的钢梁装修起来，需要三角铁与板铁，他们就从废铁中取出槽铁来，有的须锯开，有的须用震得耳鼓痛的锤子锤开，在职工们多流汗、多加工的艰苦努力下，困难终于被战胜了，创造出复修中的必需条件。
    太行自新队，在抢修岩涉段时在土、石工程中曾作了很大贡献。这次土工运输等，差不多都是他们担负的。因运输工具载量有限，并且数重不足，路越修越远，器材的供应越困难，他们在“要把自新从实际行动上表现出来”的口号下，提出了竞赛，“人闲车不闲”，黑夜白日两班运送，如此达二十天之久，他们忘记了疲劳，保证了器材的及时供应，使铺道顺利进行，他们除受到了物质奖励外，最大的收获就是劳动改造了他们，他们确是新生了。
    使修筑计划迅速完成的另一支援军，是邯郸、肥乡、成安、磁县一带的农民群众。邯峰段的枕木，原是准备邯馆（陶）路用的，这次决定运到邯郸两千余万斤，原计划一月运完，在农民们盼望自己铁路成长的热情下，他们用牛驴车一趟趟运送，虽在旧历年关也从未间断，终在两个星期就运送完毕了。他们并把贮藏了几年的铁轨零件，络绎不绝的送到铁路局。成磁某村就送到二十根埋藏的钢轨，邯郸一区中柳林村一老太太，用小竹篮放着十四个螺丝钉，亲自送到铁路局同志的手里。这一带的木材，因被日寇焚烧，已很缺乏了，但在农民的热烈支援下，信杆、桥梁等均保证了如数的供给。
    人民的铁路终于修复起来了！它从一九四九年的四月二日起，开始回答了人民对它的热望。
