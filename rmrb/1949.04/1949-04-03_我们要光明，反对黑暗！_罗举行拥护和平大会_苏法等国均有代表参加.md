Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 1st: TASS, Bucharest: The Peace Conference of Intellectual Circles of the Romanian People's Republic opened in Bucharest on March 29th. Representatives from the Soviet Union, France, Free Greece, Germany, Italy, and other countries attended.

　　Soviet representative Surkov delivered a congratulatory speech, saying: "Distinguished representatives of intellectuals from all over the world, today we want to declare: We want peace and oppose war; we want civilization and oppose barbarism; we want survival and oppose death; we want light and oppose darkness." French representative Mabel Viard said in his speech: "The glorious fortress of the peace camp is the Soviet Union led by Stalin. The French people will never fight against the Soviet Union." Free Greek representative Miltiadis said: "Greek democracy will surely triumph because our struggle is a just struggle." Italian representative Alfonso Gato said: "The Italy I congratulate you on is not the Italy represented by the Roman government, but the Italy of workers in factories, fields, scientific academies, libraries, and schools. In factories, in the squares of Milan, Turin, Rome, and Naples, millions of workers are saying 'no' to the North Atlantic Treaty and war mongers. It is impossible to make the Italian people oppose the Soviet Union, which is trusted by all peace-loving people."

　　Next, Professor Savilescu, President of the Romanian Academy of Sciences, delivered a speech elaborating on the role of intellectuals in the struggle for peace. He pointed out that imperialist countries and their governments are openly arming reactionary bandits, inciting them against the growing democratic forces of the world. He said: "In today's Romania, all the efforts of the people are focused on ensuring peace, consolidating democracy, and establishing a socialist society, and on rebuilding the national economy along new lines." He emphasized that the scientific, literary, and artistic workers of the Romanian People's Republic are determined to defend peace and oppose war and the factors of war. Our intellectuals are uniting their ranks to defend peace, civilization, and culture.

　　“我们要光明，反对黑暗！”
  　罗举行拥护和平大会
    苏法等国均有代表参加
    【新华社北平一日电】塔斯社布加勒斯特讯：罗马尼亚人民共和国知识界拥护和平大会于三月二十九日在布加勒斯特开幕。苏联、法国、自由希腊、德国、意大利及其他国家均有代表出席。
    苏联代表苏尔科夫致祝词说：“全世界知识分子的优秀代表们，今天要宣布：我们要和平，反对战争；我们要文明，反对野蛮；我们要生存，反对死亡；我们要光明，反对黑暗。”法国代表马宝尔·维亚德致词说：“和平阵营的光荣堡垒是斯大林领导的苏联。法国人民绝不对苏联作战。”自由希腊代表米尔梯亚底斯说：“希腊的民主必定会胜利，因为我们的斗争是正义的斗争。”意大利代表阿尔丰索·加托说：“向你们祝贺的意大利不是罗马政府所代表的意大利，而是在工厂、田间、科学院、图书馆和学校工作者的意大利。在工厂里，在米兰、都灵、罗马、那不勒斯广场上数以百万计的工人，对北大西洋公约及战争贩子都说‘反对’。要使意大利人民而反对所有爱好和平的人们所信任的苏联是不可能的。”
    接着罗马尼亚科学院院长萨维利斯库教授发表演说，阐述知识分子在争取和平的斗争中所起的作用。他指出：帝国主义国家及其政府正公开武装反动匪徒，煽动他们反对全世界不断增长的民主力量。他说：“在今天的罗马尼亚，人民一切努力集中于确保和平、巩固民主与建立社会主义社会，集中于沿着新的路线重建国民经济。”他着重指出：罗马尼亚人民共和国的科学、文学与艺术工作者坚决维护和平、反对战争和战争的因素。我国知识分子正团结他们的队伍维护和平、文明与文化。
