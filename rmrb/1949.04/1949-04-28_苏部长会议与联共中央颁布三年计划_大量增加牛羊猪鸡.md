Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 27th: Moscow Dispatch: The Soviet Ministerial Council and the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) promulgated on the 19th the decision regarding the three-year plan for the development of livestock breeding in collective farms and state farms from 1949 to 1951. The plan stipulates that the task assigned to collective farms is: by 1951, the amount of meat, animal fat, milk, cream, eggs, and other products supplied to cities, industrial centers, and the people of the whole country, as well as the quantity of fur and other raw materials supplied to the light industry, should be at least half more than in 1948. The plan stipulates: In 1949, collective farms should raise at least 24 million head of beef and dairy cattle (excluding the 30 million head owned by individual collective farmers, workers, staff members, and individual households). By the end of 1950, the number of cattle owned collectively will reach at least 28 million head, and by the end of 1951, at least 34 million head. The number of sheep and goats will increase to at least 88 million head by the end of 1951 (excluding those owned by individual collective farmers, workers, staff members, individual farmers, and state farms). By the end of 1951, the number of pigs raised by collective farms will increase to more than 18 million head (excluding those owned by individual collective farmers, workers, staff members, individual farmers, and state farms). By the end of 1949, the number of poultry in collective farms will increase to 65 million (excluding the current 350 million owned individually), and by the end of 1951, it will increase to at least 300 million.
　　The three-year plan assigns the state farms the task of increasing the number of beef and dairy cattle to at least 5.7 million head, sheep to 13.47 million head, and pigs to 5.6 million head by the end of 1951.
　　The plan also proposes specific measures such as expanding breeding sources in collective farms and state farms, mechanizing the labor-intensive processes of livestock farms, building sheds and barns, improving the breeding of breeding stock and veterinary work, training livestock workers, and developing scientific research in livestock breeding.
