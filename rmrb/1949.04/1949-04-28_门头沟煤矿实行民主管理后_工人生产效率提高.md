　　After Implementing Democratic Management in Mentougou Coal Mine, Workers' Production Efficiency Improves
    [This newspaper reports] Since the abolition of the contract foreman system and the organization of democratically managed production teams, the coal production efficiency of workers at the Mentougou Coal Mine has increased. First, the trade union educated worker activist Mao Shuduo, organized the brothers' production team, and made achievements, promoting all workers to abolish the contract foreman system. On April 1st, seventeen production teams officially went down the well to mine coal. Under the slogan "Today's work is for ourselves," workers worked with a new labor attitude. In the past, drilling, blasting, loading coal, and pushing carts were each managed separately, but now whoever finishes their own work helps each other. They rarely arrive late or leave early for work. From April 1st to 9th, the average daily output of coal per person was more than 11 "fen" (each "fen" equals 120 catties), which is a considerable increase in efficiency compared to the pre-liberation average daily output of about 8 "fen" per person (in the past one or two years, coal was abundant and easy to mine, but now coal is scarce and the mines are deep, so achieving the previous efficiency of about 8 "fen" was already considered an increase, but now it has exceeded 8 "fen"). Some groups are conducting coal mining competitions, and production efficiency is even higher. For example, in the competition between the first and third shifts of the twelfth group, the former averaged 19.5 "fen" of coal per person per day, and the latter averaged 21.9 "fen" of coal per person per day. The groups also pay attention to saving materials and taking care of tools. In the past, the seventeenth group would receive 70 sticks of dynamite per shift and only produce 10 carts of coal (each cart holds 1,200 catties), but now they receive 30 sticks of dynamite and produce 70 carts of coal. Unused dynamite, detonators, calcium carbide, etc., received by each group are returned to the public (for example, the seventeenth group returned all 60 unused packs of black powder). At present, the production teams are launching a large-scale production competition to continue to increase production and welcome "May Day." (Wei Jin)

　　门头沟煤矿实行民主管理后
  　工人生产效率提高
    【本报讯】门头沟煤矿工人，自废除包工柜，组织民主管理的生产组后，产煤效率提高。首先，工会教育工人积极分子毛树多，组织兄弟生产班，作出成绩，推动全体工人废除包工柜。四月一日，十七个生产组便正式下井采煤。在“今天干活为自己”的口号下，工人以新的劳动态度工作。过去打眼、放炮、装煤、推罐都是各管各，现在谁做完自己的活就互相帮助。上班下班，很少迟到早退。自四月一日至九日，平均每人日产煤十一分多（每分合一百二十斤），较解放前平均每人日产煤八分左右，效率相当提高（前一、二年煤多好采，现煤少矿深，采煤能达到以前八分左右的效率，已算提高，现在则已超过八分）。有个别组进行采煤竞赛，生产效率更高。如十二组第一班与第三班竞赛结果，前者平均每人日产煤十九分五厘，后者平均每人日产煤二十一分九厘。各组并注意节省材料，爱护工具。十七组过去每班领七十个炸药，才出煤十罐（每罐合一千二百斤），现在领三十个炸药就出煤七十罐。各组领的炸药、雷管、电石等用不完都交回公家（如十七组领黑药六十包未用，全部交回）。目前生产组为继续提高生产，迎接“五一”，正卷入大生产竞赛。（维进）
