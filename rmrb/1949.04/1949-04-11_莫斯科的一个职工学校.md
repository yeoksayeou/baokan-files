　　A Vocational School in Moscow
    By Ma'er, translated by Bo Peng

    On the road from Moscow to Smolensk, there is a large house with columns that once belonged to Count Golitsyn, now the Moscow Municipal No. 12 Vocational School. This is a school that trains highly skilled metalworkers.

    There are quite a few such typical vocational schools in Moscow alone, and even more throughout the Soviet Union. Schools like these, along with factory and manufacturing schools, which are almost seven years old, are an important source for supplementing the industrial workforce with highly skilled cadres.

    In the five years since their establishment, vocational schools and factory-manufacturing schools have trained 2.46 million highly skilled workers for the national economy. In the post-war new Five-Year Plan, the number of such educational institutions increased from 2,700 to 6,000. By the time the Five-Year Plan is completed, labor reserve schools will be training 1.2 million skilled workers annually.

    The No. 12 Vocational School currently educates 600 young men and women, which is the general number for such schools. The duration of study is two years.

    What kind of talent does the No. 12 Vocational School cultivate? They are future lathe operators, shapers, and blacksmiths. All students at the school have their expenses fully covered by the state, receiving meal allowances, uniforms, and dormitory accommodation.

    They do not pay any fees for their education. This is the regulation of the labor reserve schools.

    After graduating from the school, these young workers are assigned jobs as specialists. Female students who graduate from the school receive the same wages as male students, according to their field of study. Soviet labor law does not recognize any difference between male and female workers.

    The Soviet government expects vocational schools to cultivate workers who are proficient in their professions.

    How well does the No. 12 Vocational School fulfill this expectation? The school has specially equipped studios. Students are divided into groups. Each group is led by a production education expert. The students study Russian, mathematics, and physics. At the same time, students work in the school's factory and participate in completing small production plans, which aims for larger school objectives.

    For example, the No. 12 Vocational School is currently using the students' labor to manufacture lathe machines for producing clocks and watches. The vocational school emphasizes manufacturing one thousand such machines in the next few days. The income generated from the school's production is mainly used to improve students' meals, for the school's recreational facilities, and for the school's cultural activities. For example, students at this school who require special medical treatment go to the country's excellent sanatoriums every year, to the seaside resorts of Crimea and the Caucasus.

    The authorities of the No. 13 Vocational School pay special attention to broadening the students' horizons. The school library has 10,000 books. This library is still being systematically supplemented. The school organizes regular discussions on newly published books, invites writers, and organizes students' own reports on literary topics.

    The students of the school are members of the "Labor Reserve" socialist competition—one of the many competitors in the Soviet Union. They practice eleven different kinds of sports and are regular participants in the traditional Moscow sports meet during the sports festival.

    Foreign delegations often visit the No. 12 Vocational School, hoping to see for themselves and understand the truth of how the Soviet system cultivates the labor reserve. Just today, thirty different foreign delegations visited the No. 12 Vocational School. Among those who have come here are Americans, British, Hungarians, Czechs, Bulgarians, Romanians, etc. Not long ago, a North Korean delegation also visited the school.

    Now the No. 12 Vocational School, like all schools of this system, is preparing for graduation exams.

    This year, the Soviet Labor Reserve Schools will supply 285,000 new skilled workers—builders, railway workers, etc. The country's construction industry, factories, and manufacturing plants are waiting for them. This year, 26,000 graduates will work in mines, 30,000 in the construction industry, 20,000 in ferrous and non-ferrous metal industry factories, 28,000 in textile factories and light industry enterprises, and so on.

    A small batch of graduates from the No. 12 Vocational School joined the new supplementary force of the Soviet working class. This school was awarded the "Order of Honor" for its successful work.

　　莫斯科的一个职工学校
    马尔作  伯鹏译
    在莫斯科到斯摩林斯克路上，有一所从前是属于伯爵戈里津的有栏柱的大房子，现在是开设着莫斯科市立第十二职业学校。这是一个培养高度熟练金属工人的学校。
    象这样典型的职业学校，仅在莫斯科城就有不少，而在苏联全国那就便更多了。就象这类的学校和工厂，制造场教育的学校，已经快满七年了，这是补充工业的高度熟练干部工人的重要源泉之一。
    仅在其成立的五年期间中，职业学校和工厂——制造场教育学校，即为国民经济培养了二百四十六万高度熟练的工人。在战后新五年计划中，这类的教育机关的数量自二千七百所增多到六千所。到五年计划完成时，劳动后备军学校，每年即将增养一百二十万名的熟练工人。
    在第十二职业学校中，现在教育着六百名男女青年，这大多数是此类学校的一般的数量，修业期间为二年。
    第十二职业学校将培养出什么样的人才呢？是未来的旋盘工、削截器工人和锻冶工人，该校的全体学生，其经费完全由国家负担，他们获得膳费、制服并可住宿舍。
    对于自己的教育他们并不支出任何费用。这是劳动后备军学校的规章。
    自学校毕业后，这些青年工人们，都以专门人才的资格而被分派工作。毕业于该校的女学生与男学生，按自己的所学，获得完全的相等工资。苏联劳动法，不承认男女工人间任何的差别。
    苏联政府期望职业学校培养出的工人，都是些精通自己业务的人。
    第十二职业学校对于这一期望执行得如何呢？这一学校有特殊设备的工作室。学生们都被划成小组。每一小组由一个生产教育专家领导。本校的学生都研究俄文、数学、物理学。同时学生们在学校的工厂中工作，并参加完成不大的生产计划纲领，这是追求着更大的学校的目的。
    例如第十二职业学校，现在正以学生们的力量制造生产钟表的旋盘机械。职业学校，强调要在最近几天内制造出一千台这类的机械。学校生产所得到的收入，特别是要用于改善学生们的伙食，用于学校的休养机关及学校的文化工作。例如：这一学校的学生，如果需要特别医治的，每年都到国家的优良疗养院去，到克里米亚和高加索的海滨浴场去。
    第十三职工学校当局特别注意扩大学生们的眼界。学校图书馆有一万部书籍。这一图书馆现在还是很有系统的补充着。在学校中组织关于新出版书籍的定期讨论会，组织招待作家们，并组织学生自己对于文学题目的报告。
    该校的学生是“劳动预备军”社会主义竞赛的成员——是苏联许许多多竞赛者的一员。他们练习着十一种各种各样的运动，并且是在体育节莫斯科传统的体育大会的当然参加者。
    外国代表团时常来参观第十二职业学校，他们都希望亲自看看以便认识苏维埃制度培养劳动预备军之真象。仅在今天，到第十二职业学校去参观的即有三十个各种各样的外国代表团。到这儿来过的有美国人、英国人、匈牙利人、捷克人、保加利亚人、罗马尼亚人等。不久前，北朝鲜代表团也到过这个学校。
    现在第十二职业学校，和一切这种制度的学校同样，准备着毕业考试。
    苏联劳动预备军学校，在今年将供给二十八万五千名新的熟练工人——建筑家、铁路工人等。国家的建筑业，工厂及制造场正在等待着他们。本年将有二万六千名毕业生在矿坑中工作，三万名在建筑业中工作，二万名在黑色金属和有色金属业工场中工作，二万八千名在纺织工厂中及轻工业企业中工作以及其他等等。
    往苏联工人阶级新的补充队伍中，参加了不大的一批第十二职业学校的毕业生，这一学校由于自己成功的工作被奖赏了“荣誉章”的勋章。
