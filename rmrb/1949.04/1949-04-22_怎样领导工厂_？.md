　　"How to Lead a Factory"?
　　Gao Baifei
　　Currently, workers in various liberated areas are intensifying production with unparalleled new labor enthusiasm to support the national liberation war and build their own country. Zhao Zhankui-style labor heroes and Zhen Rongdian-style production models are constantly emerging. However, enthusiasm alone, without organization and leadership, will not transform into strength. This small book, "How to Lead a Factory" (compiled by Ai Mu, published by Dalian Dazhong Bookstore), introduces some preliminary experiences and lessons from An Dong.
　　Based on the starting point of its operations, the An Dong Textile Factory increased its production efficiency to 2,652 percent within just six months of operation. What kind of organizational leadership produced this? The author of the book reports: "(1) Grasping the workers' emotions and launching a production competition." Respect labor models and create a large number of labor model education. "(2) Implementing focused leadership." "In the entire factory, the weaving department is where the greatest success is concentrated. As long as the work in this department improves, other departments must follow suit. Therefore, the leadership devoted two-thirds of its energy to the weaving department, helping them to make specific plans, mobilizing and organizing manpower, allocating machinery, and studying how to overcome difficulties, which quickly doubled the work of the weaving department. Subsequently, the sizing, heddle threading, and warping departments also improved their efficiency under the slogan of 'supplying the weaving department.'" Without this leadership art of driving the overall situation from one point, the general production enthusiasm would not be able to fully exert its effectiveness!
　　Focused leadership must be precise organizational work. The book seizes the following three links: First, organizing manpower (systematically cultivating new models, consolidating and improving existing models... manpower allocation, mixing skilled and unskilled workers in each group, inserting competition flags in each group to compete, and holding regular meetings to conduct self-checks of work and discuss plans). Second, the coordination and adjustment of machines in each department, mainly studying how to coordinate well with each other to minimize machine problems. At the same time, implementing division of labor and strengthening responsibility. Third, in terms of technical improvement, organizing technicians and skilled workers to specifically teach apprentices, train them into skilled workers, improve production, and save manpower.
　　Thus, the production record of 2,652 percent was created.
　　The experience of another factory (a shoe factory) also proves that in the workers' unprecedented production upsurge, it is also necessary to put forward certain slogans at certain times to provide direction for action. In this factory, two slogans were put forward in three months. The first was the "Standardization" merit campaign. The second was the "Saving Raw Materials on the Basis of Standardization" merit campaign. As a result, the momentum of the production movement continued unabated and continued to develop.
　　The experience of this factory also suggests that it is necessary to constantly correct deviations and propose supplementary slogans in action, so that it can continue to develop correctly. For example, when this factory first put forward the slogan of "Standardization," it initially divided standard shoes into first, second, and third grades. As a result, everyone wanted to make first-grade shoes to win glory. On the contrary, the output was drastically reduced, and at the same time, the quality was not necessarily improved. Therefore, the leadership immediately put forward "Gluing second-grade shoes is standardization" and "Progress from making third-grade shoes to second-grade shoes is progress," correcting the deviation and achieving the goal of increasing production (taking both quality and quantity into account).
　　In this production competition, experience has also indicated that "Wage assessment is an important issue in production competition." "Wage assessment is based on technology, earning one point of wages for one point of technology. First compare within the section, and determine how much grain each for first-class technology, middle-class technology, and minimum technology; then compare with the team: who has better technology, is willing to work and teach people, and then compare with the whole factory: who works the hardest, who has research and innovation." The competition movement will be launched universally and deeply.
　　Good administrative management is also a major issue for a factory.
　　"Administrative management and trade union work are two sides of running a factory well. If the trade union is not sound, workers cannot be mobilized; new labor attitudes cannot be cultivated, and production enthusiasm will naturally not be very high. On the other hand, if administrative management is not good, consumption and waste cannot be avoided, workers' production enthusiasm is difficult to maintain constantly, funds cannot be accumulated, and expanded reproduction will also be affected."
　　Another report in this book introduces some aspects of factory administrative management. The article mentions several major issues: 1. Supply and marketing, 2. Storage, 3. Accounting, 4. Wage system, 5. Profit sharing and bonuses, 6. Factory committee. In newly liberated urban factories, the factory committee is a very important issue. The author introduces it this way:
　　"As mentioned earlier: administrative management and trade union work are two sides of running a factory well, and the two are indispensable. But the important thing is the organic connection between the two. In short, the administration is responsible for issues related to factory production, supply, and marketing; the trade union is responsible for workers' education and welfare undertakings. But in order to make the work well coordinated, issues such as the factory's production plan, the determination of wages, and the punishment, employment, and dismissal of workers should be jointly discussed and resolved by both parties. Therefore, the factory committee (with the manager or factory director as the director), or the factory management committee, or the three types of committees in Eastern European countries introduced by Liu Ningyi, can be implemented."
　　This "How to Lead a Factory" includes a total of eleven reports. It mainly introduces the successful experiences and typical examples of several factories in Northeast China in increasing production, improving quality, reducing costs, and promoting new labor attitudes.
　　Strictly speaking, the content of this book is not very rich. But this does not mean that the book is not good. Because we have very little existing experience in industrial leadership. Therefore, this book feels valuable to us, appears to be valuable, and therefore needs special introduction.
　　Old experiences must be absorbed and followed, but the main thing is to create new experiences.

### “怎样领导工厂”？

　　“怎样领导工厂”？
    高白非
    目前各地解放后的工人，正以无比的新的劳动热情，加紧生产，支援全国解放战争，建设自己的国家。赵占魁式的劳动英雄，甄荣典式的生产模范正在不断出现。但仅有热情，没有组织领导还是不会变为力量的。“怎样领导工厂”这一本小书（艾木编，大连大众书店印行），就介绍了安东这样一些初步的经验和教训。
    安东纺织厂以开工时为基数，开工以后仅六个月，生产效率就提高到百分之二千六百五十二的生产率。究竟是在怎样的组织领导下产生的呢？该书的作者报导说：“（一）抓紧工人情绪，掀起了生产竞赛”。尊重劳动模范，大量创造劳动模范的教育。“（二）实行了重点领导”。“整个工厂中，织布部是集其大成的地方，只要这部门工作提高了，别的部门也非跟上不可了。因此领导把三分之二的精力放到织布部去，帮助他们作具体计划，动员组织人力，配备机器，研究克服困难，使织布部的工作很快提高了一倍。随着浆纱、穿扣、整经各部也在‘供上织布部使用’的口号下提高了效率。”如果没有这样从一点带动全面的领导艺术，普遍生产热情是不会充分发挥效能的！
    重点领导必须是精密的组织工作。该书便抓住了以下三个环节：第一、组织人力（有计划的培养新的模范，巩固与提高已有的模范……人力的调配，把熟练与不熟练的工人混编，每组插起竞赛小旗，进行比赛，同时定期开会，自行检查工作和讨论计划。第二、是各部机器的配合调整，主要是研究如何相互配合的好，使机器少出毛病。同时实行了分工负责，加强责任。第三、是在技术的提高上，组织了技师和熟练工人专门教练习生，把他们教成熟练工人，提高生产，并节省了人力。
    于是百分之二千六百五十二的生产纪录创造出来了。
    在另一个工厂（制鞋厂）的经验中又证明：在工人们的空前的生产热潮中，还必须要在一定的时间，提出一定的口号，做行动的方向。在这个工厂，在三个月中，提出过两个口号。首先是“标准化”立功运动。其次是提出了“在标准化的基础上节省原料”的立功运动。由于此，生产运动的锐气一直有增无减，不断发展。
    这一厂的经验同时又提示：在行动中还须不断的纠正偏向，提出补充口号，使之不断的正确的向前发展。例如当这一厂最先提出“标准化”口号时，开始把标准鞋，分成一等二等三等。结果大家都想做一等鞋，争取光荣。反使产量猛减，同时质量也不一定真能提高。因此领导上马上提出“糊二等鞋就是标准化”“从做三等鞋到二等即是进步。”纠正了偏向，达到了增产（质和量兼顾）的目的。
    在这种生产竞赛中，经验又曾指明：“评定工资是生产竞赛的重要问题”。“评定工资是以技术为主，有一分技术，挣一分工资。先在本室比，订出头等技术、中等技术及起码各多少粮；再和本股比：谁的技术好，肯干肯教人，然后和全厂比：谁最埋头苦干，谁有研究创造。”竞赛运动便普遍而又深入的展开。
    一个工厂，良好的行政管理也是个主要的问题。
    “行政管理和职工会工作是办好工厂的两面。职工会不健全，工人不能动起来；新的劳动态度不能养成，生产情绪自然不会很高。另一方面，如果行政管理的不好，则消耗和浪费无法避免，工友的生产积极性也很难保持经常，资金无法积累，扩大再生产也要受到影响。”
    这本书里的另一篇报导，关于工厂行政管理作了一些介绍。文里提到了几个主要的问题：一、供销，二、保管，三、会计，四、工资制度，五、分红、奖励，六、工厂委员会。在新解放的城市工厂里，关于工厂委员会是一个很重要的问题。作者这样介绍：
    “前面谈过：行政管理和工会工作是搞好工厂的两面，二者不可或缺。但重要的则是两者的有机联系，简言之，关于工厂产、供、销有关问题，由行政负责；关于工人的教育、福利事业等，则由工会负责。但要使工作配合得好，关于工厂的生产计划，工资的确定以及工人的处分、采用及解雇等等，应由双方共同讨论解决。因此工厂委员会（由经理或厂长任主任），或工厂管理委员会或象刘宁一所介绍的东欧国家的三种委员会等，是可以施用的。”
    这本“怎样领导工厂”，一共包括了十一篇报导。主要是介绍东北几个工厂从事增加产量、提高质量、减低成本、发扬新的劳动态度的成功经验和典型例子。
    严格说来，这本书的内容并不很丰富。但不能因此说这本书不好。因为我们既有的工业领导经验很少。所以这本书对我们觉得可贵，显得有价值，也就特别需要介绍。
    旧的经验是要吸取遵循的，但更主要的还在创造新的经验。
