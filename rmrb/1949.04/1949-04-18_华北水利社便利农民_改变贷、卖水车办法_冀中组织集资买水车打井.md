　　North China Water Conservancy Society Makes Things Easier for Farmers
    Changing the Methods of Loaning and Selling Waterwheels
  　Jizhong Organizes Collective Fundraising to Buy Waterwheels and Dig Wells

    [Reported by this newspaper] With the approval of the North China People's Government, the North China Water Conservancy Promotion Society changed its methods of loaning and selling waterwheels, and the results have been good. The society previously ordered 3,400 waterwheels from factories in Shijiazhuang City (half of which were tube waterwheels) and entrusted the production promotion societies of Shijiazhuang City and nine counties including Huolu, Zhengding, Pingshan, Lingshou, Xingtang, Yuanshi, Zhao County, Gaocheng, and Luancheng to loan and sell them in the direct promotion area. It is understood that farmers in various counties urgently request to purchase more waterwheels; however, due to recent price fluctuations, the price of waterwheels is based on millet as the standard (for example, each large white tube waterwheel is priced at 820 catties of millet), and the cash part is converted according to the current millet price, which is considered expensive. In order to take care of the farmers' purchasing power and based on the principle of ensuring the cost of raw materials for waterwheels, the society is eager to lend and sell the waterwheels that have been produced, and has specially requested the approval of the North China People's Government. Starting from April 5th, all cash payments will be converted into millet prices based on the cost of iron, that is, the original regulations for lending waterwheels will still be repaid in installments. For those who repay in three installments (one-third in cash, and one-third each after wheat and autumn harvests), or those who repay in two installments (one-half in cash, and one-half after wheat and autumn harvests), the cash payment will be lower than the current millet price. The parts to be paid after the wheat and autumn harvests will still be based on physical millet, which can be converted into wheat and cotton at that time. Methods were also set to reward cash purchases. After this, the number of farmers purchasing waterwheels increased sharply. As of April 11th, the society had lent and sold 220 waterwheels (excluding those wholesale to various counties), but only one-third were purchased in cash. The main reason is that the organization and publicity work in various counties are not keeping up. According to the comrades of the society's credit department, except for Xingtang in the Fourth Prefecture of Chahar Province, which pays more attention to the use of water conservancy, the current central task of other counties is to solve the issue of substitute cultivation and promote sowing. Some cadres believe that the issue of organizing the purchase of waterwheels to utilize water conservancy is not yet in season, and they generally ignore it. For example, Zhengding County Society has manufactured more than 70 waterwheels, but only ten have been sold so far. However, according to experienced farmers, it is best to water the land before sowing this spring because there is little rain and the weather is relatively cold, which will better ensure seedling emergence. Therefore, in these areas, it is an important issue that needs to be solved urgently in the current agricultural production to earnestly organize farmers to utilize water conservancy, combine it with sowing, and launch a wheat field watering campaign under possible conditions, which should attract the attention of the leaders in these areas.

    [Jizhong Electric] The Jizhong Water Conservancy Promotion Society has now prepared well-drilling equipment and is organizing farmers to carry out water conservancy construction. The society has recently acquired 972 waterwheels from the Ninth and Eleventh Prefectural public waterwheel factories through ordering, cash payment, and exchange of scrap iron, and purchased various well-drilling equipment from Tianjin, including more than 9,000 catties of lead wire, more than 12,000 catties of tree palm, 28 iron cones, as well as cone handles, bamboo tubes, bamboo poles, wire ropes, and cement. A part of it has now been launched. The cadres of the credit department have divided into three groups and gone to the countryside to organize and educate the masses to carry out well-drilling in three key counties (Ding County, Qingyuan, and Jin County). The cadres in Dongjianyang Village, Ding County, deeply understand that many farmers have had the idea of digging wells and buying waterwheels for many years, but they cannot afford to dig wells due to poverty. Some worry that if they dig wells and buy waterwheels, others will sabotage them and not repair them. The cadres immediately educated the masses to organize themselves, raised funds to buy four waterwheels based on the actual situation. Other places also use this experience to raise funds to buy waterwheels and repair old wells, so that water conservancy work can be carried out.

　　华北水利社便利农民
    改变贷、卖水车办法
  　冀中组织集资买水车打井
    【本报讯】经华北人民政府批准，华北水利推进社改变贷卖水车办法，收效良好。该社前曾在石家庄市各工厂定制水车三千四百辆（其中管子水车占一半），并以石市及获鹿、正定、平山、灵寿、行唐、元氏、赵县、藁城、栾城等九县为直接推广区，委托各该县市生产推进社贷、卖。据了解，各县农民迫切要求添购水车；但由于最近物价波动，因水车定价以小米为标准（如白大筒管子水车，每架定为八二○斤米），现款部分按目前米价折，颇感价昂。该社为照顾农民购买力，并按水车原料保本原则，急于将已制出之水车贷售出去，特呈请华北人民政府批准，自四月五日起，凡交现款部分，改以铁价保本折成米价，即原规定出贷水车办法，仍分期归还，按三期归还者（现款三分之一，麦和秋后各交三分之一），或两期归还者（现款二分之一，麦秋后交二分之一）之现款部分，一律均低于目前米价折付，麦秋后交付部分，仍以实物小米为标准，可折合当时麦、棉。并定了办法奖励现款购买。此后，购水车之农民骤增，截至四月十一日止，该社贷售者已达二百二十辆（往各县批发者不在内），但以现款购买者，仅占三分之一，其主要原因，即各县的组织和宣传工作多跟不上去，据该社信贷部同志了解，察省四专区除行唐对利用水利比较重视外，其他各县的目前中心工作在解决代耕和推动播种，对组织购水车利用水利问题，有的干部认为还不到季节，一般比较忽视。如正定县社自制七十余辆水车，迄今只卖出十辆。但据有经验的农民谈，今春雨少，天气较寒，播种前最好将地浇一遍，这对出苗更有保证。因此，在这些地区认真组织农民利用水利，与播种相结合，并展开可能条件下的浇麦田运动，是当前农业生产中急待解决的重要问题，应引起各该地领导者的注意。（林远）
    【冀中电】冀中水利推进社，现已备好打井器材，正组织农民进行水利建设。该社近在九、十一专区各公营水车工厂，以订购、现款与破铁交换的办法，掌握起水车九百七十二辆，并从天津购来各种打井器材，计铅丝九千余斤，树棕一万二千余斤，铁锥二十八根及锥把、竹筒、竹竿、线绳、洋灰等，现已推出一部。信贷部干部分了三组，分头下乡，现正在三个重点县（定县、清苑、晋县）组织与教育群众开展打井。在定县东建阳村的干部，深入群众了解有不少农户，多年即有打井买水车的思想，但因穷困打不起井，有的顾虑打了井买了水车，别人使坏了不给修理。干部即根据实际情况，教育群众组织起来，集资买了水车四辆。其他地方也运用这一经验集资买水车，修理旧井，使水利工作得以开展。
