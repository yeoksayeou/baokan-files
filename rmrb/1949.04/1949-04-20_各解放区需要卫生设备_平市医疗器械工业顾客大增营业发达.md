　　Various Liberated Areas Need Sanitary Equipment
  　The Medical Device Industry in Beiping Sees a Surge in Customers and Thriving Business
    [This newspaper] Beiping’s medical device industry, which was on its last legs before liberation, is now vibrantly active again. Companies like Efeng, Xintai, and Shibao suffered during the enemy-puppet regime due to the competition from the medical device factory established by the Japanese in Beiping, as well as restrictions on the private sale of finished products (which had to be sold to the Beiping Medical Device Company established by the Japanese, and then sold exclusively by them). As a result, the business of these factories gradually declined. After the Japanese surrender, the Kuomintang took over the Beiping Medical Device Factory, selling off large quantities of finished products cheaply on the market, while also allowing American goods to flood the market. This pushed the local medical device industry in Beiping to the brink of collapse. After the liberation of Beiping, health departments from the North China, East China, Central Plains, and Northwest military regions sent people to various factories in Beiping to place orders and negotiate purchases. This included ordering 50 distillers and 300 simple blood transfusion tubes from the North China Medical Device Company; ordering 500 scalpels and 20,000 forceps from the Shibao Factory; and ordering over 10,000 straight-toothed vascular forceps, angled-tooth vascular forceps, and ordinary vascular forceps from the Efeng Factory. At the same time, the North China Medical Device Company, the Six Great Medical Device Companies, and the Beiping Device Company have all sold a significant number of medical instruments. The Shibao Factory is now planning to increase its workforce from three to twenty workers to expedite the production of these orders. The Xintai Factory, which closed down last October due to the economic downturn, is also stepping up its efforts to resume production. There are only four medical device factories in Beiping (the rest are all sales stores), and their scale is not large, but due to the widespread need for medical devices in various places, the business situation of each factory is unprecedentedly good, and they are all optimistic about the future. This shows that industries that are closely related to the people's lives will definitely develop. (Ming)

　　各解放区需要卫生设备
  　平市医疗器械工业顾客大增营业发达
    【本报讯】解放前夕已成奄奄一息的平市医疗器械工业，现又朝气勃勃地活跃起来。锷锋、新泰、世保等家在敌伪统治时期，因遭日本所设北平医疗器械工厂出品的抵制，以及限制成品私售（必须售给日本开办的北平医疗器械公司，然后统售），各厂营业逐渐不振。日本投降后，国民党接收北平医疗器械工厂，将大量成品廉价销于市面，同时放任美货流入市场，本市医疗器械工业遂陷崩溃境地。北平解放后，华北、华东、中原、西北等军区卫生机关纷纷派人来平市各厂订货和洽购，计在华北医疗器械行订制蒸溜器五十个，简便输血管三百个；在世保工厂订制手术刀五百把，摄子二万把；在锷锋工厂订制顺牙血管摄子、斜牙血管摄子以及普通血管摄子万余把。同时，华北医疗器械行、六大医疗器械行、北平器械行都销出了不少医疗器具。现在世保工厂拟由三个工人增至二十人，来赶造这批订货。去年十月因萧条而歇业的新泰工厂也正加紧复工。北平医疗器械工厂仅有四家（其余均为销售店），规模均不大，但由于各地对医疗器械的广泛需要，各厂营业情形也空前良好，故对前途均抱乐观。这说明真正与人民生活有密切关系的工业，一定会得到发展。（鸣）
