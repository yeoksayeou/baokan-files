　　Eliminating the Enemy's Artillery Firepower
    —A Record of the Artillery Battle on the Outskirts of Taiyuan—
    The battle to clear the outskirts of Taiyuan was launched with powerful artillery fire. The so-called "Taiyuan Fortress," boasting three thousand cement bunkers and four strong defense lines, was completely crushed under the steel torrent of the People's Artillery's general offensive. "Suppress the enemy's artillery fire, rain shells on Yan's bandits, and blast a path for the infantry's charge!" This was the slogan of the siege artillery. They overcame numerous difficulties to haul howitzers weighing tens of thousands of kilograms up the mountains. On April 20th, the attack began, and the People's Liberation Army's mobile artillery groups first unleashed their initial barrage on the command center of the bandit chief's headquarters, the Pacification Commissioner's Office. Immediately afterward, all cannons of various calibers simultaneously bombarded enemy artillery positions at Huangjiafen, Dadongmen, Shuangta Temple, and other locations. Instantly, the defending enemy's seven hundred cannons fell silent. For a long time, Yan Xishan had boasted about his so-called "fire sea tactics," intending to simultaneously blanket the People's Liberation Army's advancing areas with a "sea of fire" from all five hundred of his mortars and two hundred mountain guns, field guns, and howitzers. But the People's Artillery responded with just one sentence: "Eliminate the enemy's artillery firepower!" A certain artillery unit participating in combat for the first time hit forty-four out of fifty shells fired at Shuangta Temple. The only enemy artillery that dared to counterattack was immediately silenced. When the infantry on the western outskirts launched their attack, an artillery company from a certain unit, firing from 8,000 meters away with four hits out of three shells in an indirect fire mission, severed the retreating enemy's escape route. When the infantry on the eastern front attacked the fortress's warehouse area, an artillery unit blasted apart three large enemy bunkers and nearby firing points in one go. Soon, the assault team's red flag appeared on the enemy's fortifications, and the infantry commander informed the artillery by telephone: "Comrades, your artillery fire is excellent; we have advanced smoothly!" On the afternoon of April 21st, an enemy armored train in the northeastern part of the city attempted to block our charging infantry. A company from a certain unit hit both the engine and the carriages with two shells, turning it into a heap of scrap metal. Five enemy aircraft attempting to provide assistance were also driven away by our anti-aircraft fire. The enemies, battered everywhere, hid in their underground bunkers like rats. When they tried to come out for some fresh air during the lulls in the bombardment, they immediately found themselves face to face with the People's Liberation Army and became prisoners.

　　取消敌炮的发言权
    —太原外围炮战记—
    扫清太原外围之战，是以强大炮火揭开的。拥有三千个洋灰碉堡和四道强固防线的所谓“太原要塞”，在人民炮兵总攻击的钢铁倾流之下全被轰垮了。“制压敌人炮火，把炮弹打在阎匪头上，轰开步兵冲锋道路”，这是攻城炮兵的口号。他们克服了多种的困难，把一尊尊上万斤的榴弹炮拉上山去。二十日攻击开始，解放军的机动炮群首先将第一批炮弹倾泻到群首指挥中心的绥靖公署。接着，所有各种口径的大炮同时向黄家坟、大东门、双塔寺等敌炮兵阵地猛轰。顿时守敌的七百门大炮哑然无声了。阎匪锡山很久以来就吹嘘着所谓“火海战术”，把他所有的五百门迫击炮和二百门山炮、野炮、榴弹炮同时将解放军前进的地区轰成“火海”。但人民炮兵的回答只是一句话：“取消敌人炮兵的发言权！”第一次参加战斗的某部炮兵，向双塔寺打五十炮便命中了四十四炮。唯一敢于反击的敌炮立即消声敛迹了。当西郊步兵发起攻击时，某部一连炮兵从八千公尺外以四发三中的超越射击，炸断了逃敌的退路。当东路步兵进攻要塞仓库区时，某部炮兵一气打垮了守敌三个大碉堡及其附近的火力点。不久突击队的红旗便在敌人工事上出现，步兵指挥员用电话通知炮兵说：“同志们的炮打得好，我们已经顺利前进了！”二十一日下午，城东北敌铁甲列车正想阻击我冲锋的步兵，某部一连两炮都打在车头和车箱上，把它打成一堆废铁。企图助战的五架敌机也被我高射炮轰跑了。到处挨打的敌人象老鼠一样的藏在地洞里。当他们想在轰击的间隙钻出来换换空气时，立即发现解放军就在自己面前，他们成了解放军的俘虏。（张帆）（新华社太原前线二十六日电）
