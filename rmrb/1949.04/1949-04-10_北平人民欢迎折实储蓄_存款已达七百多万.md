　　People of Beiping Welcome the Commodity Unit Savings
  　Deposits Reach Over Seven Million
    [Report from this newspaper] Since the opening of the Savings Department of the Beiping Branch of the People's Bank of China on the 1st, business has been developing daily. In nine days (from the 1st to the 9th), a total of 313 depositors opened accounts, absorbing 83,160 commodity units in deposits, equivalent to RMB 7,595,624.96 yuan. Among the four types of savings, "lump-sum deposit and lump-sum withdrawal" was the most popular, with 234 accounts; followed by "periodic deposit and lump-sum withdrawal," with 40 accounts; then "lump-sum deposit and periodic withdrawal," with 33 accounts; and "fixed deposit with interest payment" with one account. According to the department's statistical analysis of depositors' occupations, there are seven types: freelancers, workers, soldiers, civil servants, teachers, students, and merchants. Among them, civil servants accounted for the largest proportion, accounting for 39% of depositors; followed by teachers and students, accounting for 32.8%. In order to thoroughly introduce "commodity unit savings," the bank sent mobile teams to various factories, schools, and organizations to investigate and explain. Workers raised many questions to them, and most requested the establishment of agencies as soon as possible to facilitate workers who live far from the Savings Department. Others suggested that the Savings Department should not fix the number of units to be deposited each time for "periodic deposit and lump-sum withdrawal" too rigidly. The Savings Department values ​​these opinions and will gradually study and improve them where possible.

　　北平人民欢迎折实储蓄
  　存款已达七百多万
    【本报讯】中国人民银行北平分行储蓄部自一日开业后，业务日见开展。九天（一至九日）中共开了三百十三个存户，吸收存款八万三千一百六十个实物单位，合人民币七百五十九万五千六百二十四元九角六分。在四种储蓄中，“整存整付”者最多，为二百三十四户；其次为“零存整付”，四十户；再次为“整存零付”，三十三户；“存本付息”者一户。据该部统计分析存户职业，计有：自由职业、工人、军人、公务员、教员、学生、商人等七种。其中公务员最多，占存户百分之三十九；其次为教员、学生，占百分之三十二点八。该行为了深入介绍“折实储蓄”，曾派出流动小组前往各工厂、学校、团体调查解释。工人向他们提出许多问题，多数要求赶快设立代理处，以便利距储蓄部较远的工人。另外也有建议储蓄部把“零存整付”每次存入单位数不要规定的太固定。储蓄部对这些意见都很珍视，将在可能情况下逐渐研究改善。
