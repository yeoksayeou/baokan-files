　　Bolshevik Concern for Schools
	Translated by Jun Qiang

　　In the years before the revolution, there was only a three-year primary school in the village of Gonokhova, with thirty or forty students. Now, a complete school has been built in the center of the village, with new school buildings, teachers' dormitories, and a sports field.

　　Before the October Revolution, very few people in the village were literate. Now, few young people have not received seven years of schooling. Many residents of the village have become teachers, agricultural technicians, animal breeders, and mechanics. There are now five hundred collective farm children studying in the seven-year school.

　　The Gonokhova school is one of the best in the Altai region. The school's curriculum is well organized, which has improved student progress. Students regularly receive labor practice in agricultural production. The school has a model experimental farm, and the teachers deeply consider how to make students more familiar with agricultural machinery.

　　The success of the Gonokhova school is closely linked to the local Party regional committee. The Party watches it at all times, carefully studying all its actions. The Party regional committee secretaries, Comrades Skvortsov and Chernenko, often visit the school and talk with the teachers; they have a strong interest in the education of young people.

　　Party regional committees elsewhere also pay close attention to the schools in their areas, treating them as if they were studying the most important theory.

　　It cannot be said that the regional committees did not pay attention to the people's education in the past, but the scope of their concern for schools was narrow. They were interested mainly in whether the school had enough textbooks, stationery, furniture, or fuel, and whether the school buildings were repaired on time. As for curriculum education, they only made general criticisms and occasionally listened to reports from the regional people's education department.

　　Now, the regional committees are exploring the actual work of the schools. This does not mean that they no longer pay attention to the material needs of the schools, but that they are no longer limited to that aspect. The regional committee secretary and other comrades consider it their duty to regularly visit village schools. They talk with teachers about improving their theoretical knowledge and competence, and help them solve matters related to school administration.

　　One day, when we arrived at the Zavyalovo Party regional committee, Comrade Secretary Skvortsov was not there. "He must be at the collective farm?" "No, he went to the Zavyalovo middle school to find him today," the regional committee answered us.

　　We found Comrade Skvortsov, who was discussing the teaching of agricultural biology with the teachers. The teachers decided to consult with him on how to organize the research system of this course in a better way. Similar meetings and conversations are very common here.

　　Comrade Marikov of the Party regional committee propaganda department recently listened to a teacher explain the Soviet Constitution at the Gilev junior middle school. He noticed that the teacher only used the Constitution textbook and advised him to use some supplementary materials and documents, and introduced him to the preparation of charts.

　　Directly familiarizing themselves with the work of the school and personal contact with the teachers enable the regional committee to have a more complete understanding of the state of the people's education. They are able to adopt methods to avoid shortcomings in a timely manner and provide the necessary assistance to the school. At regional committee meetings, they systematically listen to reports from the principal and the secretary of the school's Communist Youth League.

　　The regional committee spends a lot of time and energy on the political education of teachers. Some teachers study the history of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) in groups, or study Marxist-Leninist theory on their own. Teachers of biology, history, and literature have monthly seminars. At one meeting, they studied the results of the conference of the Federal Academy of Agricultural Sciences named after V.I. Lenin.

　　Last summer, a large amount of work was carried out in the Zavyalovo region to prepare the schools for the year. Initiated by the Communist Youth League members of the "Red Lighthouse" collective farm, a movement to help schools was launched. Thousands of collective farm peasants participated in repairing school buildings and preparing firewood for the schools. The "Ilyich's Testament" farm, the Gilev and Kharitonov tractor distribution stations, installed electric lights in their schools and teachers' dormitories. The instrument makers prepared a large number of school supplies. They even cared about the students' warm breakfasts.

　　In short, the regional and village Party organizations have done everything they can to make the schools standard model schools. The example of the Zavyalovo region shows the relationship between the Bolsheviks and the people's education, and it is very important to spread this experience widely to Party organizations in various places.

　　布尔什维克对于学校的关切
    君强节译
    革命前那些年，在哥诺霍瓦村只有一个三年级的小学校，三四十个学生。现在，村庄中央已建起了完整的学校，又新建了校舍、教员宿舍和运动场。
    村庄里，在十月革命前，识字的人占极少数。现在青年中间却很少没受过七年学校教育的了。村子里许多居民已作了教师、农业技师、动物饲养家和机械师。现在七年学校里有五百个集体农场的孩子们在学习。
    哥诺霍瓦的学校，在阿尔泰地方是最好的一个。校中课程进度组织很好，这样就提高了学生的进步性。在农业生产上，经常给学生们劳动的练习。校中附设有模范的实验场，教师们深刻的考虑到怎样才能使学生们更熟习农业的机器。
    哥诺霍瓦学校本身的成功，是和该地党的地区委会密切的连系着的。党时时刻刻注视着它，仔细地研究它的一切行动。党地区委员会书记斯克沃尔曹夫和切尔宁可同志，时常到学校去访问，同教师们谈天，他们对于青年的教育问题，感到浓厚的兴趣。
    别的地方的党地区委会，也是同样注重他们那儿的学校，他们对于学校象是研究某项最重要的理论。
    不能说从前地区委会完全不注意到人民的教育，但是它对于学校关心的范围却是狭小的。他们感到兴趣的，主要是校中的课本、文具、家具、或者燃料够不够，以及是不是按时修缮了校舍等问题。至于课程教育的工作，只总括的批评，时常听听地区人民教育部的报告。
    现在，地区委会却是探究学校实际工作情形。这并不表示他们已不再注意校中的物质需要，而是已经不局限在那一方面了。地区委会书记和其他工作同志，认为经常到村庄的学校去是自己的责任。他们同教师们谈论关于提高他们理论认识的水准的工作问题，还谈到教师权能问题，帮助他们解决和学校行政有关的事项。
    这一天，当我们到了杂维芽罗党的地区委会时，书记斯克沃曹夫同志没有在。“一定在集体农场吧？”“没有，今天到杂维芽罗中学找他去了。”地委会回答我们。
    我们找到斯克沃曹夫同志，他正和教师们谈论关于农业生物学的教授，教师们决定和他商量，怎样组织这门功课的研究系统较为好些。类似的会见和谈话，在这里是十分普通的。
    党地区委会宣传部同志玛立可夫，不久以前曾在吉列夫初级中学听教师讲解苏联宪法。他注意到教员只用宪法课本，就劝他采用一些补充资料和文件，介绍他编制图表。
    直接去熟习学校工作情形和同教师们私人的交际，使地区委会关于人民教育事业的状况，得到更完满的了解。并且能及时的接受避免缺点的方法，而给与学校必要的帮助。在地区委会开会时，有系统的听取校长和校中共产主义青年团书记的报告。
    对于教师们的政治教育，地区委员会化费了许多时间和精力。教师们一部分在小组中研究联共（布）党史，或者自己研究马列主义的理论。生物学、历史和文学的教师们，每月都有讨论会。在一次会议上，他们曾研讨过联邦农业学院会议的结果，这个学院的名字是伊里奇·列宁。
    去年夏天，在杂维芽罗夫地区，进行了庞大的工作，给学校作了一年的准备。由“红色灯台”集体农场的共产主义青年团员们发起，展开了援助学校运动。成千的集体农场农人们参加修理校舍，替学校准备木柴，“伊里奇遗训”农场，吉列夫和哈里托夫曳引机配给所，给自己的学校和教员宿舍都装上了电灯。器具师们预备了大批的学校用具。他们连学生们温热的早餐也要关心到的。
    总之，为了使学校成为标准的模范学校，地区和村庄的党组织机关作了他们能做的一切。杂维芽罗地区的实例，表示出了布尔什维克和人民教育事业的关系，使这种经验广泛的传播到各地党组织中去，是很重要的一件事。
