Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 1st: TASS, New York: At the plenary session of the New York Scientific and Cultural Conference for the Defense of World Peace on March 27th, the famous Soviet writer Fadeyev delivered a long speech. He said:

　　The Soviet people are for peace. Every unbiased American and Western European, upon entering our territory, cannot fail to experience the firm pulse of peaceful life that pervades our entire atmosphere. The 25-year plan for the construction of Moscow, the plan to plant forests in the vast grasslands of the European part of the Soviet Union to guarantee high agricultural yields, Academician Lysenko's large-scale experiments in planting perennial wheat, new works at the Moscow Art Theatre, the cheerful and optimistic mood of the citizens, the calm tone of the newspapers, and the clear voices of the children. We are now raising so many children, who are the symbols of life, the symbols of a life reaching the most beautiful and hopeful state.

　　The Soviet Union is for peace, supporting peace with the strength of a socialist country, filled with creative plans and confidence in the future. In the huge budget for 1949, amounting to 415 billion rubles, almost 40 percent of the funds are invested in the restoration and development of the national economy, and 30 percent are used for cultural endeavors. In 1949, the Soviet Union had 40 million children in school and nearly two million university and college students.

　　Indeed, there are some people in the world, even some newspapers, who believe that our frank and unreserved expression of support for our government's peace policy, that is, the expression of all the Soviet people, is a sign of "no freedom of speech." But we would like to ask, is the blatant promotion of a new war by certain newspapers to be regarded as an expression of "freedom of speech," while the sincere efforts of all people (undoubtedly including the people of both the United States and the Soviet Union) to support peace are considered unfree? When and by whom was this principle established?

　　In this world, only truth is freedom. Before resolving the question of who is more free in the world, it is necessary to honestly determine whose side the truth is on.

　　After elaborating on the deep friendship between the peoples of the United States and the Soviet Union since the American War of Independence in the eighteenth century, Fadeyev said: After our two great peoples shed blood together against the German Nazis who attempted to dominate the world, it would be strange if we could not find common ground to guarantee peace among all nations of the world.

　　People often ask us how the Soviet people view the American people. I think this question is easiest to answer if I talk about it from the field I am most familiar with. According to statistics from the All-Soviet Publishing House from 1917 to 1948, works by 206 American writers (I am only talking about literary works) have been translated into Russian and other languages in the Soviet Union. A total of 2,245 American books were published, with a total circulation of 39,709,000 copies. These include the works of Jack London, Sinclair, Thompson, Mark Twain, Ashleigh, Dreiser, Cooper, Steinbeck, and others. This is the interest that people have in American literature, which reflects the past and present lives of the American people.

　　From this, you can see how unfair are the arbitrary words spread by some American journalists and even official American organs, saying that the Soviet people deny American culture and try to limit themselves to their own national culture. Yes, the Soviet people believe that any great, true, and simple work of art grows from the soil of the national masses. Such an undeniable truth is their starting point. The Soviet people are indeed proud of their own national culture. The national pride of the Russian people arises, among other things, from their knowledge that from the nineteenth century to the beginning of this century, the great Russian classics—the works of Tolstoy, Gogol, Turgenev, Chekhov, and Gorky—had a rich influence on certain aspects of the development of American literature. Stanislavsky's system is used in American drama schools. The plays of Russian playwrights are staged on American stages. The love for Soviet culture and Russian culture has aroused respect for any advanced and progressive achievements in the culture of other nations and countries. This mutual respect and love mark the friendship of the Soviet nationalities. The profound respect for every advanced and progressive achievement created by American culture is reflected in the interest in American literature, which I have just introduced to you.

　　The ideal of international solidarity of progressive forces does not mean contempt for the national and cultural freedom of various countries. It is completely different from the unfounded "cosmopolitanism" that actually conceals racial superiority.

　　It is truly surprising to read the February 6th statement in the Washington Star about the infamous North Atlantic Treaty. The newspaper even believes that the Atlantic Treaty is the first step in establishing a "United States of Europe." The newspaper demands that European nations "forget national pride," which is to despise European countries with centuries of culture. The newspaper confidently says: "The British must abandon their pride to a considerable extent." France is called the "most ambitious" country in Europe by the newspaper. The newspaper even threatens France with "collapse" if it insists on expressing its national pride. I don't know who gave the author of this article such authority, but he dares to say: "The United States is naturally the cornerstone of this policy (that is, establishing the North Atlantic Treaty and then establishing the United States of Europe)." According to the author, the borders between the countries of the North Atlantic Alliance are less important than the borders within the United States.

　　We Soviet cultural workers, nurtured in an environment of respect for the national cultures of large and small countries, cannot but believe that this treaty is a plot to murder the autonomy of nations, to dissolve their national cultures, and to make their national policies subordinate to the interests of some powerful countries seeking world hegemony. In this situation, we clearly see the tendency to implement the racist theory that Churchill announced in Fulton.

　　Some say that this treaty and group are used to prevent aggression, because it is said that the Soviet Union is simultaneously threatening the people of Europe, Asia, and the Americas. But people only need to look at the world map to know that these words are spread from the camp of prejudiced people to confuse inexperienced people. From Greenland, through Iceland, Britain, Portugal, Spain, Germany, Greece, the Near East, and the Middle East, the Pacific Islands to China and Japan, does the Soviet Union have its own military bases? Does the Soviet Union have troops stationed in Greece, Egypt, Transjordan, Iran, Indonesia, Vietnam, and other countries?

　　These facts all illustrate that the threat of a new war does not come from the Soviet Union, but from the insatiable people in the countries of the world who are keen to launch a bloody new war. However, those who launch a new war must remember: the people of all countries in the world will never enter a new war. If anyone tries to drag them into a new war, the people of the whole world will severely punish the initiators of these new wars. Therefore, the Soviet people will do their best to support the American people's desire to strive for peace and consolidate peace, as expressed by the progressive leaders of the American people.

　　Those who are most concerned about peace and the coexistence of all countries are first and foremost all the ordinary people, women, and mothers, because if a war occurs, it will mean the death of their sons. Because some people, regardless of the historical lessons of the recent past, are trying to use the great discoveries in science and technology not to improve the welfare of mankind, but to destroy the fruits of civilization, and to eliminate millions of children, women, and the elderly. This shows that the efforts of benevolent people to defend peace must first be closely combined with the massive popular movements of all countries in the world to fight for the common goal of striving for peace and suppressing war-mongers.

　　Long live all the peaceful forces that oppose war, regardless of nationality or race, regardless of political or religious beliefs! Long live the friendship of all nations in the struggle for lasting peace! Strive for peace on a global scale!

### 纽约保卫和平大会上　苏联是拥护和平的　苏名作家法捷耶夫演词

　　纽约保卫和平大会上
  　苏联是拥护和平的
  　苏名作家法捷耶夫演词
    【新华社北平一日电】塔斯社纽约讯：在纽约科学与文化界保卫世界和平大会的三月二十七日全体大会上，苏名作家法捷耶夫发表长篇演说。他说：
    苏联人民是拥护和平的。不带偏见的美国人和西欧人在进入我国领土时，没有一个不体验到我国整个空气中那种坚实和平的生活脉搏。建设莫斯科的二十五年计划，在苏联欧洲部分的广大草原区域植林，以保证高额农产的计划，科学院会员李森科大规模种植多年生产小麦的实验，莫斯科艺术院的新作品，公民们的愉快而乐观的心情，报章的平静语调，孩子们的清亮的声音。现在我国抚育着这样众多的孩子，他们是生命的标志，是生活达到最美好，最有希望的境地的象征。
    苏联是拥护和平的，尽社会主义国家的力量来拥护和平，他充满着创造性的计划和对前途的信心。一九四九年数达四千一百五十亿卢布的庞大预算中。几乎百分之四十的经费投资于恢复和发展国民经济，以百分之三十用于文化方面。苏联在一九四九年有四千万在学儿童，将近二百万大中学生。
    的确，世界上有些人，甚至有些报纸认为：我们，也就是说苏联全体人民，支持我们政府的和平政策的坦率无隐的表示，是“没有言论自由”的表现。但是，我们愿意问问，某些报纸露骨地鼓吹新战争，可以当作是“言论自由”的表现，而一切人民（无疑的也包括美国和苏联人民在内），支持和平的诚挚的努力，却被认为是不自由，这是什么时候，由什么人规定的道理呢？
    在这一世界上，唯有真理才是自由的。在解决世界上谁较比自由的问题以前，必须老实地确定真理在谁的方面。
    法捷耶夫在详述十八世纪美国独立战争以来美苏两国人民深厚的友谊之后说：在苏联和美国的人民共同流血，反对妄图称霸世界的德国纳粹之后，如果我们两国伟大人民不能够找到共同之点来保障全世界各国人民之间的和平，将是奇怪的。
    常常有人问我们苏联人民对美国人民的态度怎样。我觉得如果我从我最熟悉的领域上来谈，这个问题是最容易回答的。根据一九一七年至一九四八年全苏出版局的统计数字，有二百零六个美国作家的作品（我所谈的只是文学作品）在苏联被译成俄文和别种文字。二千二百四十五种美国书籍，共印行了三千九百七十万零九千册。这里面有杰克·伦敦的著作，辛克莱、汤普生、马克·吐温、奥什利、德莱塞·古柏、史坦培克等人的著作。这就是人民对于反映了过去和现在美国人民生活的美国文学所有的兴趣。
    从这里面你们可以看到某些美国记者还有美国的官方机关所散播的武断之词，说什么苏联人民否认美国文化，并且极力把自己局限在自己的民族文化的范围内，是何等不公平。是的，苏联人民是以为艺术上任何一件伟大、真实和纯朴的作品，都是从民族的人民大众的土壤上滋长起来的。这样一个无可置辩的真理是他们的出发点。苏联人民确是以他们自己的民族文化自豪。俄罗斯人民的民族自豪感之所以产生，除了其他的事情外，也是由于他们知道：从十九世纪到本世纪初，俄罗斯伟大的经典作品——托尔斯泰、戈果里、屠格涅夫、柴霍甫和高尔基的作品，对美国文学发展的某些方面起了丰富的影响，史丹尼斯拉夫斯基的体系在美国的戏剧学校中使用着。俄罗斯剧作家的剧本在美国舞台上上演。对苏联文化与俄罗斯文化的热爱，引起了对其他民族与国家的文化中任何一点先进与进步的成果之尊重。这种互相尊重与爱好，标志着苏联各民族的友谊。对美国文化所创造的每一点先进与进步成果的深巨的尊重，反映在对美国文学的兴趣上，这一点我刚才已经向你们介绍过了。
    进步力量的国际团结的理想，并不表示轻视各国的民族与文化上的自由。它与实际上掩饰种族优越论的毫无根据的“世界主义”是截然不同的两回事情。
    读到二月六日的华盛顿明星报关于声名狼藉的北大西洋公约的言论实在令人大为惊讶。该报竟认为大西洋公约是建立“欧洲合众国”的第一步。该报要求欧洲各民族“忘却民族自尊”，这是轻视有千百年悠久文化的欧洲国家。该报自信地说：“英国人必须在相当大的程度上抛弃他们的自尊”。法兰西被该报称为欧洲“最有野心”的国家。该报并以如果法兰西坚持要表露它的民族自尊，就会“崩溃”相威胁。我不知道是谁使该文作者有这样的权威的，但是他竟敢于说：“美国自然是这种政策（即建立北大西洋公约然后建立欧洲合众国）的基石。”照该文作者看来，北大西洋联盟各国间的疆界倒不如美国国内的疆界重要。
    在尊重大小国家民族文化的环境中培养起来的我们苏联文化工作者，不能不认为这种条约是要谋害各民族的自主权，要溶解他们的民族文化，要使他们的本民族政策服从于某些强国中企求世界霸权的贪得无厌之徒的利益。在这种情形之下，我们明显地看到了那种实施邱吉尔在富尔顿宣布的种族论的趋势。
    有人说，这个公约和集团是用来防止侵略的，因为据说苏联是在同时威胁欧洲、亚洲和美洲的人民。但是人们只要看一下世界地图，就可以知道这种话是从有偏见的人的阵营里散布出来，以迷惑没有经验的人们的。从格陵兰，经冰岛、英国、葡萄牙、西班牙、德国、希腊、近东和中东各国，太平洋诸岛到中国和日本，难道苏联有它自己的军事基地吗？在希腊、埃及、外约但、伊朗、印尼、越南和其他国家里，难道苏联驻有军队吗？
    这些事实在在都说明了新战争的威胁不是来自苏联，而是来自世界上热衷于发动血腥新战争的国家里面的贪得无厌的人们。但是，发动新战争的人们记住：世界各国人民决不会进入新战争，如果有谁企图强把他们拖入新战争，全世界的人民将会严惩这些新战争的发动者。因此，苏联人民将尽他们最大的力量，支持美国人民的进步领袖所表达出来的美国人民争取和平与巩固和平的愿望。
    对于和平与各国的共存最表关切的，首先就是一切老百姓、妇女和母亲，因为如果发生战争，将意味着他们的儿子的死亡。因为有些人不顾刚过去不久的历史教训，企图把科学与技术上巨大的发现不是用来增进人类的福利，而是用来毁灭文明的果实，用来消灭千百万儿童、妇女和老年人。这就说明了，善意的人民保卫和平的努力，首先必须紧密地与世界各国巨大的人民群众运动结合起来，为争取和平、压制战争贩子这个共同目标而斗争。
    不分民族与种族，不论政治与宗教的信仰，一切反对战争势力的和平力量万岁！各民族在争取持久和平斗争中的友谊万岁！争取全世界范围的和平！
