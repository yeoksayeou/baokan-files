Xinhua News Agency, Yangtze River Front, 23rd: The powerful People's Liberation Army corps that swiftly crossed the Yangtze River had drilled in river warfare for a month in the Jiangbei water region, a place characterized by interconnected lakes and harbors. This ensured the victory of the Yangtze River Crossing Campaign. As early as late March, various units of the Second Field Army successively convened forums with soldiers and boatmen, learning water experience and boating skills from the working people on the Yangtze River. A surge of learning to be boatmen swept across the army. A certain unit first organized cadres and soldiers to observe the riverbank on-site, and then practiced rowing in lakes. To dispel the soldiers' concerns about using small boats, large and small boats set off simultaneously during the river crossing drill, and as a result, light boats and arrow boats took the lead swiftly; in the night water offensive and defensive battle drill, the attacking troops' small boats suddenly approached the opposite bank from five miles away, and by the time the defending comrades realized it, they were caught off guard. After these experiments, the soldiers happily composed a quick verse saying: "The small boat has a small body, light and flexible, fast speed, small target, rushes ashore, the enemy doesn't even know."

In the training upsurge, the Communist Party members and cadres of each unit personally took the lead in the drills. In a certain unit, when the model company commander was 50 meters away from the shore, he jumped into the chest-deep cold water first, and the soldiers followed suit, completing the drill of quickly seizing the bridgehead on the shore. After meeting and discussing, they summarized the experience of "three speeds for rapid crossing", namely: get on the boat quickly, row the boat quickly, and get off the boat quickly. In a certain battalion, twenty people learned to row a boat in one day, among them, soldier Zhou Haiqing rowed even faster than the boatmen. A certain unit universally proposed learning three major water skills, namely, setting sails, steering, and distinguishing wind direction. Other personnel, such as medics, practiced water rescue, and telephone operators practiced water wiring. All personnel worked hard for the victorious river crossing and studied various new working methods.

In the pre-crossing study, the various units of the victorious Third Field Army generally promoted military democracy, solving many new tactical and technical problems in the southern expedition across the river. The units adopted learning methods such as mutual teaching and learning, cadres learning first and then teaching soldiers, reporting skills, and practicing and studying at the same time, extensively giving play to military democracy, hence the whole army's learning enthusiasm was generally high. Although it was continuous spring rain, many soldiers disregarded getting wet and practiced barefoot in the mud. The artillery also practiced marching on the fields in the rain and trained mules and horses to cross bridges by the river. A certain platoon used tarpaulins to set up small sheds to study the construction of artillery positions. The "Weixian Hero Company" used coats and bowls with shooting holes drawn on them to form models of embankments and bunkers indoors in heavy rain to study how to attack and develop firepower. Many soldiers practiced swimming regardless of the cold. Soldier Dong Yuxiu stayed up all night at his desk drawing diagrams and came up with some ways to deal with the enemy's defensive fortifications. After studying, many commanders and fighters said with confidence: "The Red Army had heroes when crossing the Wujiang River, heroes when crossing the Dadu River, and watch us when crossing the Yangtze River!"

　　南征大军演习河川战
  　保证了神速渡江
    上船快！划船快！下船快！
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
    【本报讯】据新华社长江前线廿三日电：神速渡过长江的人民解放军强大兵团，渡江前曾在湖港错杂的江北水乡演习了一个月的河川战，因而保证了渡江作战的胜利。第二野战军各部早在三月下旬即先后召开了战士、水手的座谈会，向大江上的劳动人民学习水上经验与驾船技术。全军掀起了学习当水手的热潮。某部首先组织干部战士到江边实地观察，然后在湖泊里普遍练习划船。为了打破战士们使用小船的疑虑，在演习水上进军时大小船只同时出发，结果轻舟箭船飞快当先；在演习夜间水上攻防战时，攻击部队的小船在五里外突然靠拢对岸，待防守的同志发觉时，已经措手不及。经过这些试验，战士们高兴地编了个快板说：“小船身子小，轻便又灵巧，速度快，目标小，突击上了岸，敌人还不知道。”
    各部队的共产党员和干部们，在练兵热潮中都亲自带头演习，某部战斗模范连长当船只距岸还有五十米达时，首先跳下没过胸口的冷水里，战士们也跟着踪身下去，完成了迅速强占岸上桥头阵地的演习。经过开会研究以后，他们总结出“抢渡三快”的经验，即：上船快，划船快，下船快。某营一天中有二十个人学会了划船，其中战士周海清比船工还划得快，某部普遍提出学会水上三大技术，即挂帆、掌舵、辨别风向。其他如卫生员演习水上抢救，电话员演习水上架线等，所有人员都为胜利渡江进行苦练，并研究种种新的工作方法。
    胜利渡江的第三野战军各部在渡江前的学习中，曾普遍地发扬军事民主，解决了渡江南征中许多新的战术和技术问题。各部采用了互教互学，干部先学，再教战士，报本领，边演习、边研究等学习方式，广泛的发挥了军事民主，因之全军学习热情普遍高涨。虽然春雨连绵，许多战士却不顾淋湿身子在泥泞中赤脚演习，炮兵也冒雨在田径上练习行进，在河边训练骡马过桥。某排用油布支起小棚子学习构筑炮兵阵地，“潍县英雄连”在大雨天便在屋里用大衣包和画上射击孔的碗摆成堤坝和地堡模型，研究如何攻击和发扬火力。许多战士不顾寒练冷习游泳。战士董玉秀通夜伏在桌上画图样，想出好些对付敌人防御工事的办法。经过学习后，许多指战员都信心百倍的说：“红军过乌江有英雄，过大渡河有英雄，过长江看我们的！”
