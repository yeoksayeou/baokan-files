A Proposal from the Youth League to Literary and Art Workers
    He Jingzhi

    "We ask literary and art workers to depict our youth and the activities of our Youth League more in the future, and to use literary works to help educate our youth!"

    This is a passage from a speech by a representative at the First Congress of the North China New Democratic Youth League.

    This is an extremely important suggestion for our literary and art workers.

    At the same meeting, reports from various regions on youth activities and Youth League work further powerfully demonstrated the importance of this suggestion.

    In our people's long revolutionary struggle, especially since the War of Resistance Against Japan and the People's Liberation War, under the education of the Party, and tempered by various earth-shattering struggles, millions of young people, as the new generation of our people, have shown unprecedented awareness and great new strength. Especially in the two or three years since the establishment of the Youth League's own advanced core organization—the New Democratic Youth League—under the Party's care and guidance, the manifestation of this awareness and great strength has become even more obvious.

    With the further development of the revolutionary situation, the above situation has added important new components and new glory to the Party and the democratic government's work agenda and to our people's various lives and struggles.

    In the villages after the end of land reform, the vast majority of villages with Youth League organizations are filled with a new atmosphere compared to other villages. All the work led by the Party and the government has been completed and exceeded the tasks with the strong assistance and active promotion of the Youth League members, along with all the liberated peasants. There, it is full of the healthy and happy songs of the young people.

    Ding County, Hebei Central, has had 5,000 Youth League members since it began building the League in 1946. They have guaranteed the completion of conscription work several times, and have played an active role in various tasks. Young people take striving to join the New Democratic Youth League as their goal. For more than two years, the League has cultivated a large number of new cadres and continuously sent advanced League members to join the Party.

    An excellent stretcher team in Zunhua, Hebei East, was organized and consolidated with the support of young Party members and Youth League members. In the Tianjin Campaign, some Youth League members heroically sacrificed themselves while completing their tasks, and as a result, more young people applied to join the League on the front lines and were approved.

    In the troops, where young people account for the absolute majority, the heroic deeds of the young soldiers have long been well known.

    In a factory in Shijiazhuang, in the production competition, the vast majority of the winning red flags were planted on the machines used by the Youth League members.

    Almost in many villages, such things have happened: fathers brought their sons to the Youth League branch and said: "I have handed my child over to the Youth League. You should educate him well. The future belongs to you young generation!"

    Indeed, this young generation, the children of millions of workers and peasants, under the shining light of Mao Zedong, has begun a great new life and embarked on a new path for the future.

    So, why shouldn't our literary and artistic creators depict our "young generation" more, and use our works to educate this "young generation," so that they can avoid wasting their youth with "Seven Heroes and Five Gallants" and "Three Swordsmen" like the previous generation?

    In the past, our authors have depicted various aspects of our people's struggle life. Among them, we have seen the death of the old society and old characters, and also the growth of the new society and new characters, but people know that in our works, new and positive characters are still few and often not outstanding enough. Sometimes in a work that is generally not bad, compared to the performance of the two types of characters, the new characters always seem powerless. — This is a phenomenon that is inconsistent with the development of objective reality.

    But today, in any case, this situation must end. The new life and new tasks force our authors to eliminate those incorrect ideological viewpoints and methods. Strengthen the experience of the new life, and strengthen the understanding of the new characters. The times require our authors to portray our people's new heroic figures more, and to portray our growing young generation, to describe the various lives and struggles of this generation of young people; to describe how the Party organizes and educates young people to embark on Mao Zedong's new path; to describe the activities of the New Democratic Youth League; to describe the various deeds of struggle of the Youth League members.

    Everyone knows that the Soviet Communist Youth League member Paul left a glorious image in Ostrovsky's works. Fadeyev's novel "The Young Guard" is based on the heroic struggle of the Communist Youth League members. Soviet writers portrayed the heroes of the young generation of the motherland and made every effort to educate the Youth League members and the entire Soviet youth with their works.

    So, we have reason to hope that our authors will go to the youth more, to the various activities and committees of the Youth League, to familiarize themselves with them, so that our own "Paul" and our own "Young Guard" can appear in our artistic works. And, make our art workers educate our young generation with their works. It is conceivable how excited the youth will be—when they no longer have to gamble and lose peanuts because they are "bored," but instead concentrate on reading the novels, stories, and poems written for them by our authors!

### 青年团对文艺工作者的一个提议

　　青年团对文艺工作者的一个提议
    贺敬之
    “我们要求文艺工作者今后多描写我们的青年，和我们青年团的活动，用文艺作品来帮助教育我们的青年！”
    这是在华北新民主主义青年团第一届代表大会上，一位代表讲话中的一段。
    对于我们的文艺工作者，这是一个极重要的提示。
    同一会议上，各个地区的关于青年的活动及青年团工作的报告，又更加有力地证明了这一提示的重要性。
    在我们人民长期的革命斗争中，特别是自抗日战争和人民解放战争以来，在党的教育下，在各种惊天动地的斗争的锻炼中，千百万青年，作为我们人民的新生的一代，显示了他们空前的觉悟与伟大的新力量。尤其在党的关怀与指导下建立了青年自己的先进的核心组织——新民主主义青年团之后的两三年来，这种觉悟与伟大力量的表现就更加明显了。
    随着革命形势的更向前发展，上述情况已经在党与民主政府的工作日程上，在我们人民的各种生活与斗争中，增加了重要的新的成份与新的光辉。
    在结束土改后的农村里，绝大多数有青年团组织的村庄，都较之其他村庄更加充满了新的气象。党和政府所领导的各项工作，都是在青年团员的有力协助与积极推动下，和全体解放了的农民一道完成并超过了任务。那里充满了青年们健康愉快的歌声。
    冀中定县，自一九四六年开始建团以来，到现在已拥有五千名团员，他们几次都保证了参军工作的完成，并且在各种工作中都起了积极作用。青年们以争取加入新民主主义青年团为他们的努力目标。两年多以来，团培养了大批新干部，并不断输送先进的团员参加了党。
    冀东遵化的一个出色的担架队，是在青年党员与青年团员的支持下组织与巩固起来的。在天津战役中，有的青年团员在完成任务时英勇牺牲了，结果是更多的青年在火线上申请入团被批准。
    在青年成份占绝对优势的部队中，年青的战士们的英勇事迹，是早为人们所熟知了的。
    石家庄的一个工厂，在生产竞赛中，绝大部分的优胜的红旗是插在青年团员们使用的机器上的。
    几乎在很多村庄里都出现过这样的事情：父亲把儿子带到青年团的支部那里，说：“我把孩子交给青年团了，你们好好管教他吧。以后是归你们这年青的一辈了！”
    的确，这年青的一辈人，千百万的工农劳动人民的孩子，在毛泽东的光辉照耀下，开始了伟大的新的生活，走上了未来的新的道路。
    那么，我们的文艺作者，为什么不应该更多的表现我们的“年青的一代”，并且用我们的作品去教育这“年青的一代”，使他们避免象上一辈的人们一样用“七侠五义”“三侠剑”来消磨青年时代的光阴呢？
    过去，我们的作者，曾经描写了我们人民的斗争生活的各个方面。其中我们见到描写了旧社会和旧人物的死亡，也描写了新社会和新人物的生长，但是，人们都知道，在我们的作品里，新的积极的人物还是不多并且还常常是不够出色的。有时在一部大致还算不坏的作品里，对于新旧两种人物的表现，比较起来，新人物总还是显得无力。——这是与客观实际的发展不符合的现象。
    但今天，无论如何，这种情况一定要终止了。新的生活与新的任务迫使我们的作者一定要肃清那些不正确的思想观点与方法。更加强对于新的生活的体验，加强对于新的人物的了解。时代要求我们的作者，更多的表现我们人民的新式的英雄人物。表现我们的正在生长的年青的一代。描写我们这一代青年们的各种生活与斗争；描写党如何组织与教育青年走上毛泽东的新的道路；描写新民主主义青年团的活动；描写青年团员们的各种斗争事迹。
    大家都知道：苏联共产主义青年团员保尔在奥斯特洛夫斯基的作品里留下了光辉的形象。法捷耶夫的长篇小说“青年近卫军”是以共产主义青年团员们的英勇斗争为题材的。苏联的作家表现了祖国的年青一代的英雄们，并尽一切努力以他们的作品去教育青年团员和整个苏联青年。
    那么，我们有理由这样希望：我们的作者更多地到青年中间去，到青年团的各种活动和各级委员会中去，熟悉他们，以便在我们的艺术作品里能出现我们自己的“保尔”和我们自己的“青年近卫军”。并且，使我们的艺术工作者，以他们的作品来教育我们年青的一代。可以设想，青年们会多么兴奋——当他们已不必因为“闷的慌”去打赌输花生，而是去专心地阅读我们的作者为他们所写作的小说、故事、诗歌的时候！
