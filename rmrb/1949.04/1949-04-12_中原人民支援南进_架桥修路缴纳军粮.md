Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains, 10th: The people of the Central Plains are launching a large-scale upsurge to support and welcome the southward advance of the People's Liberation Army. Young adults throughout the region brave wind and rain to repair roads and build bridges, paving the way for the southward advance of the army. The people of a certain district in Guangshan built a bridge capable of carrying ten tons in thirteen days. When repairing the Huai River Bridge, engineer Ye Luoyi carried stones himself despite being ill, staying up all night. He said, "It is an honor to work hard to support the southward advance of the People's Liberation Army." Currently, over thirty bridges of various sizes and over three hundred li of highways from Huangchuan to Xixian, Huangchuan to Xincai, and Huangchuan to Xinxian have been cleared. Over ten thousand farmers in Xinzheng County have repaired two hundred li of highway branch lines and built seventy-one bridges of various sizes. To ensure the supply of military grain, the people throughout the region are enthusiastically paying advance public grain, calling this advance grain "victory grain" and "crossing-the-river grain." Many counties and districts have already completed their advance tasks. In order to supply the southward advancing army in a timely manner, the Chengguan District of Xin'an County, each mill actively grinds flour, and quickly ground 500,000 jin of dry and good white flour. Various places have adopted the method of collecting and transporting grain at the same time, so that all the grain and fodder can be quickly transported to its destination. Villages and towns along the transportation routes have established "Southward Advance Army Reception Stations." Jia County has set up three supply stations, in addition to supplying grain and fodder to the passing army, it has also purchased a large number of vegetables, oil, salt, pigs from the surrounding villages, and mobilized residents to grind tofu and sprout bean sprouts, etc., to ensure that the troops have no difficulty in eating vegetables. Each station also regularly prepares twenty stretchers and thirty ox carts, specializing in transporting sick soldiers. The support-the-frontline committees in each village have set up road signs and guide lights at each intersection to guide the troops. Villages are welcoming the southward advancing army with gongs and drums. Farmers have automatically vacated their houses in advance for the soldiers to stay in.

　　中原人民支援南进
    架桥修路缴纳军粮
    【新华社中原十日电】中原人民掀起大规模的支援和欢送解放军南下的热潮。全区青壮年冒着风雨赶修公路、架设桥梁，为南下大军铺平进军道路，光山某区人民十三天内造好载重十吨的一座大桥。修建淮河大桥时，工程师叶罗怡带病亲自抬石头，彻夜不眠，他说：“为了支援南下解放军，累点亦光荣”。现该线潢川至息县、潢川至新蔡、潢川至新县三十余座大小桥梁，三百余华里公路已告畅通。新郑县万余农民修复了公路支线二百华里，并建造了大小桥梁七十一所。为保证军粮供应，全区人民踊跃缴纳预借公粮，他们称这次借粮为“胜利粮”、“过江粮”。很多县、区并已全部完成预借任务。新安县城关区为及时供应南下大军，各磨坊积极磨面，迅速磨出五十万斤又干又好的白面，各地并采取了随缴随运的办法，使全部粮草很快运达目的地。交通沿线地区各村镇均成立了“南下大军招待所”。郏县并设立了三个兵站，除供给过境大军粮草外，又从四乡购买了大批菜蔬、油盐、猪和发动居民磨豆腐发豆芽等，保证部队吃菜不发生困难。各站并经常预备二十付担架和三十辆牛车，专门运送行军病号。各村支援前线委员会，在各交叉路口设置了路标和指路灯，给部队做向导。各村锣鼓喧天地迎接南下大军。农民们都预先自动腾出自己的住房，给战士们住宿。
