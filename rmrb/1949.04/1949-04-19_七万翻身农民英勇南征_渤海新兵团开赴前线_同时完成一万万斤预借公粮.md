Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 17th: The new recruit corps composed of over 72,000 emancipated peasants from the Bohai region is heading to the front lines in force to ensure the realization of Chairman Mao's Eight Peace Conditions. They all joined the army around the time of the Winter Festival and the New Year, and after three months of training, their political consciousness and military skills have greatly improved. Before their departure, they made contribution plans and wrote letters home to say goodbye.

Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 17th: The Bohai region's task of pre-procuring 120 million jin of public grain to support the southward advance of the army was successfully completed on the 20th of last month. At the same time, the Jiaodong region also completed the transportation of 70 million jin of military grain. Party and government leading organs at all levels in the Bohai region attached great importance to this grain borrowing, with responsible comrades personally deploying and mobilizing, and cadres at all levels going deep into the masses to promote the idea that grain borrowing is for the rapid liberation of all of China. Villagers of Zhang Feng Village in Lijin County said, "The troops are seeking liberation for us, if we don't provide food, who will?" The entire village delivered the full amount of pre-procured grain early one morning. In the Jiaodong region's procession of transporting military grain, banners fluttered with slogans such as "Push more, walk faster, save labor" and "Supporting the southward advance is our duty."
