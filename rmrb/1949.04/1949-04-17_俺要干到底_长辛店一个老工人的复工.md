　　I Will See it Through to the End
　　——A Veteran Worker from Changxindian Resumes Work
　　Lù Fěi
　　On the afternoon of March 8th, comrades from the trade union preparatory committee came to my house to inform me that I would be going to work tomorrow. I was so happy that my heart was pounding. Eight or nine years, no, almost ten years, since I last stepped into the factory! I've finally reached the end of my suffering, eking out a living with a vegetable stall that was only slightly better than begging! Only with the return of the Communist Party can a poor wretch like me, with no windows or doors, enter the factory! I've come to understand this path! This time, I absolutely must see it through to the end.
　　The world has changed. Our own trade union has been established, and they're all genuinely working for the people! How can I put it? Look at all the veteran workers who lost their jobs during the "February 7th" strike, they've all gone back to work. Wu Zhen's widow, the martyr of the "February 7th" strike, received a thousand catties of rice to start a small business to supplement her income and make ends meet. Ge Shigui's son, who used to learn a trade but was forced into the police force by the Kuomintang, is now able to learn a trade again according to his own wishes. Isn't this all obvious? Not to mention those artisans who were dismissed by the Kuomintang, aren't they all registering and applying to go to Beiping? Who ever did these things for us in the past?
　　On March 9th, I went to work. Many young people looked at me, and old colleagues came over to greet me. A young clerk said, "You haven't worked for so long, is your skill still up to par?" Ha! What kind of question is that? I've been working since I was fifteen until I was over fifty, can you count how many years that is? I've practically eaten this machine into my stomach! It's like when you're young and studying, haven't you eaten all the characters into your stomach? Can you forget them? One comrade said, "You're a veteran worker from the 'February 7th' strike, you have to work hard and take the lead." Alas! Do I still need comrades to worry about that? I can compete with the young people in terms of physical strength, and when it comes to skill and experience, taking the lead goes without saying. I've tasted all the joys and sorrows of life, how could I disgrace the name of a veteran worker from the "February 7th" strike! I can't, I can't!
　　Why can't I? Take the "February 7th" strike for example. At that time, I was full of youthful vigor, fighting for holidays and an eight-hour workday. I ended up in jail, and I didn't get to enjoy the benefits myself. But those who died, though they died, didn't all the benefits end up being enjoyed by the younger generation? I'm enjoying them today too. That day, the comrades talked about labor protection, welfare, and how workers' lives would be even better in a socialist society! I'm old, maybe I'll catch up, maybe I won't. But one can't be short-sighted! Won't the younger generation be better off? Even this big factory, back in the day when we worked with queues, didn't have this scale, and wasn't it all won through blood and sweat? If people's minds are opened, they can do anything and take the lead.
　　It's true that people's hearts are different, some turn quickly, some turn slowly, no rush! In this day and age, anyone who goes down the wrong path can be pulled back by our Chairman Mao! What's to be afraid of! Now, after so many days of liberation, to tell you the truth, the world has changed, and people have changed. But there are still some who take off their hats and bow when they see our People's Liberation Army comrades, trying to say only good things to you. Who knows what they're really thinking, maybe they're still hoping for the "Kuomintang's return"! And then there are some people who are honest and stutter, speaking slowly and working without any urgency. And then there are some people who are only concerned with their own affairs! Who cares about improving their skills?... In that world, everyone had their own way! You couldn't trust things on the surface! You had to distinguish between nice-sounding words and bad-sounding words, and have a bottom line in your heart! That's my old experience.
　　Take my eldest son's matter for example! In the first few days, I kept hoping he would come back to work. He was originally an artisan, and wouldn't it be better if two people were earning money? Yesterday, I received his letter saying he had joined the People's Liberation Army, and I was truly happy! Look, this letter, he says the People's Liberation Army is so good, so good. To be honest, back then when he joined the security force, he did it himself. There was no food or drink at home, and he wanted to get promoted and make a fortune! That was the wrong path. Now it's good! I'm writing to him, telling him not to be indecisive, not to be on two different wavelengths from his father. The Communist Party only looks at whether the qualifications are enough, and doesn't rely on anything else! You have to see it through to the end! Only then will you be worthy of the people!
　　Tell me, how many people wouldn't be happy in a world led by the Communist Party? All of us poor workers from the past are smiling from ear to ear!

　　俺要干到底
    ——长辛店一个老工人的复工
    逯斐
    三月八日下午，工会筹委会同志到俺家来，通知俺明天就去上班，俺高兴得心一个劲跳。八九年，不，将近十年，没走进厂门了！成天摆一个比讨吃强些的菜摊，俺这份罪总算尽头了！共产党回来，才有俺这没窗户门子的臭干活的进厂门！俺算是认清这道儿啦！这回，可是非干到底不行。
    世道变了，自个的工会办起来了，全是真心实意替人办事！怎末说呢？你看“二七”时失业老工人都上了班，“二七”烈士吴珍他媳妇领了一千斤米，做个买卖点补着，能过日子了。葛士贵他儿子，早先学手艺，叫国民党闹的去搞警务段，现在他自个愿学手艺，还叫学手艺，这不是明摆着么？不说这，就是叫国民党刷下的那些手艺人，不是也上北平去登记投考了么？过去，谁给俺们办过这些事？
    三月九日，俺上了班，好些年轻人看着俺，老同事也过来拉着俺。年轻的司事说：“你这久没上班了，手艺还能行么？”嗨！这什么话，打从十五岁干到五十多，你算算有多少年？这份机器都吃到肚子里了！打个比方吧！你从小念书，字可不全吃到肚子里了？能忘么？有一个同志说：“你是二七老工人，你得好好干，干在前面。”唉！这还能叫同志操心？卖力气可以跟年轻人比，讲手艺，老经验，干在前面还用说？一辈子甜酸苦辣全尝过了，还能丢“二七”老工人的脸！不能，不能！
    为什么不能？就拿二七来说，那时俺血气方刚，争礼拜、争八小时，当时俺下了大牢，自个没享受到，那死了的虽死了！可这利益不全叫后辈享受到了么？俺今天也享受到了。那天同志讲劳动保护、福利、社会主义社会，工人生活才更好！俺这大岁数，许赶上许赶不上？可眼光不能浅！后辈还不好了么？就是这大厂，当年甩了辫子上班，那有这规模，还不全是流血流汗争来的！人要思想开了，什么都能干在前面。
    说的是人心不一样也是真的，有的转的快，有的转得慢，不忙！这年头，那个上了岔道，也能叫俺毛主席给拉回来！怕什么！现在，解放了这么些天，说句良心话，天变了人变了。可也还有见了咱解放军同志摘帽子鞠躬，尽挑好话给你说的，他心底怎样，说不准还盼“刮民党”呢！又有一种人，老实结巴，说话绵，没紧没慢的工作。又有一种人自个心里尽操心自个的事！管什么手艺提高呢？……那世道各人有各人的道！明面上的事不能准信！好听的话，赖听的话，要分清，心里要有底！这是俺老经验。
    就拿俺这大小子的事说吧！早先那几天，俺尽盼着叫他回来上班，他原本是手艺人，两个人赚钱不更好？昨个收到他的信，说他参加了解放军，俺可真心实意的喜欢！你瞧，这信，他说解放军这么好那么好的。说实心话，当年他去当保安队，可是自个投的，家里没吃喝，想升官发财呢！那是岔道。现在好了！俺给他去信，叫他别三心两意，别跟爹成了两码子心，共产党只看材料够不够，不能凭什么！要干到底！才对得起人民！
    你们说，共产党领导的世道，能有几个不乐意的呢？俺这伙子从前穷干活的谁都裂开了嘴了！
