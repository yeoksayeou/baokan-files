　　Chiang Bandit Steals Cash from National Treasury
  　Accelerating Sharp Depreciation of Bogus Currency
    [Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, 16th] A joint session of the Internal Affairs Committee and the Finance Committee of the Control Yuan of the Nanking Kuomintang government passed a resolution on the 14th, admitting that the action of bandit chieftain Chiang Kai-shek in looting the national treasury's cash accelerated the collapse of the credit of the bogus Gold Yuan Certificates, causing drastic fluctuations in prices, thereby deepening the disaster of the people in the Kuomintang-controlled areas. The resolution demanded the immediate return of the gold, silver, and foreign exchange reserves stored in Taiwan and Xiamen under Chiang Kai-shek's orders. According to various sources: Around the time of bandit chieftain Chiang Kai-shek's "retirement," the bogus Central Bank's gold reserves were 3.9 million taels, 70 million silver dollars, and 70 million US dollars in foreign exchange, totaling approximately 300 million US dollars. After bandit chieftain Chiang Kai-shek's "retirement," the bogus Central Bank has, under the orders of bandit Chiang, successively transported gold, silver, and foreign exchange worth approximately 200 million US dollars to Taiwan and Xiamen. The above figures do not include the national treasury property transported by the bogus Central Bank to other cities in South China and overseas under orders, including 100 million Hong Kong dollars deposited in Hong Kong.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, 16th] According to various reports, the situation of soaring prices and sharp currency depreciation in the Kuomintang-controlled areas continues to develop. On the 15th, the bogus Gold Yuan Certificates depreciated by 40% in Shanghai market in a single day. The ratio of gold (per tael) and US dollars (per dollar) to the bogus Gold Yuan Certificates reached new highs of 7.5 million to one and 148,000 to one respectively, an increase of more than 37,000 times compared to last August. In Hankow, the continuous depreciation of the bogus Gold Yuan Certificates and the daily fluctuations in prices have plunged industry and commerce into a major collapse. In the three towns of Wuhan, four-fifths of the knitting industry has closed down, and most of the flour mills have ceased operations. The only remaining cotton textile factory in Wuhan, the Wuchang No. 1 Textile Co., Ltd., has shut down. Of the more than one hundred cigarette factories in Hankow, more than ninety have stopped production, and of the original two hundred and ten rice mills, fifty-eight have stopped production, and the rest are also in dire straits.

　　蒋贼盗劫国库现金
  　加速伪钞猛烈贬值
    【新华社北平十六日电】南京国民党政府监察院内政委员会及财政委员会联席会议在十四日通过的一项决议中，承认匪首蒋介石劫走国库现金的行动加速了伪金圆券信用的崩溃，造成物价猛烈波动，从而加深了国民党统治区人民的灾难。该项决议要求立即运回根据蒋介石的命令而移存台湾及厦门的库存黄金、白银及外汇。据各方消息披露：在匪首蒋介石引退前后，伪中央银行的库存黄金为三百九十万两，银元七千万枚，外汇七千万美元，三项合计约值三亿美元。在匪首蒋介石引退后，伪中央银行已奉蒋贼之命，陆续将约值二亿美元之金银外汇运至台湾及厦门。以上数目，尚未计入伪中央银行奉命运往华南其他城市及海外的国库财产，其中包括存在香港的一亿元港币在内。
    【新华社北平十六日电】据各方报道：国民党统治区物价猛涨与纸币猛跌的情势正继续发展中。十五日上海市场伪金圆券一天之内即贬值百分之四十，黄金（每两）及美钞（每元）与伪金圆券的比价达到一比七百五十万元及一比十四万八千元的新高峰，与去年八月比较已涨了三万七千倍以上。在汉口，伪金圆券的不断贬值与物价的逐日波动，已使工商业陷于大崩溃。武汉三镇的针织工业关门的已达五分之四，面粉工厂已大部停工。武汉仅存的棉纺织厂武昌第一纺织股份有限公司，已停顿。汉口纸烟厂百余家停工者已达九十多家，碾米厂原有二百一十家中，五十八家已停工，其余亦在风雨飘摇中。
