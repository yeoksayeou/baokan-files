　　(I)
　　To all commanders and fighters of the 13th Corps, 41st Army, 121st Division, 122nd Division, and 123rd Division of the Chinese People's Liberation Army:
　　Under the correct leadership of Chairman Mao and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and under your mighty power, you liberated the ancient capital of Beiping, rescued the people of Ping City who had been ravaged by the enemy for a long time, and quickly restored order in Beiping and stabilized social security. Your spirit of serving the people, your iron-like discipline, and your serious and amiable style have deeply moved the people of Beiping. You are the heroes of the people of Beiping. We, on behalf of the 2.35 million people of Beiping, extend our highest respect to you.
　　As you are about to leave the people of Beiping, all the people of Beiping sincerely bid you farewell. We will step up production, study hard, consolidate the rear to support the front, and conscientiously carry out preferential treatment for military families. We hope that you will resolutely and thoroughly eliminate the enemy and liberate all the compatriots of China.
　　The people of Beiping offer a brocade banner, hoping that you will plant the banner of victory on the city walls of Nanjing and Wuhan, and throughout China. We wish you continued success in serving the people. The people of Jiangnan are eagerly waiting for you to liberate them, and the people of Beiping will also look forward to the constant stream of your victorious news.

　　To all commanders and fighters of the Beiping Disciplinary Corps of the Pingjin Garrison of the Chinese People's Liberation Army:
　　Under the leadership of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the People's Liberation Army rescued the people of Ping City who had been under long-term oppression by the enemy, and quickly restored order in Beiping and stabilized social security. Your spirit of serving the people, your iron-like discipline, and your serious and amiable style have deeply moved the people of Beiping. You are the heroes of the people of Beiping. We, on behalf of the 2.35 million people of Beiping, extend our highest respect to you.
　　In the past two months, you have fully demonstrated the excellent qualities of the people's army, truly implemented the Three Main Rules of Discipline and the Eight Points for Attention, protected the lives and property of the people of Beiping, and made it impossible for all hidden bandits and special agents and saboteurs to operate. Beiping is entirely owned by the people, and the people have true democracy and freedom. This is your achievement, and this is why the people of Beiping love you so much. We hope that you will expand this achievement and continue to serve the people! We will step up production, study hard, and consolidate the rear to support the front. The military and civilians will work together to build a new Beiping!
　　On behalf of the people from all walks of life in Beiping, this committee presents a brocade banner, wishing you continued success in serving the people and successfully completing your work tasks!
　　Salute!
