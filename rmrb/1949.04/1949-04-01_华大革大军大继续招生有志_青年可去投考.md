    Your letters have been received successively.
    Now, North China University, North China People's Revolutionary University, and North China Military and Political University are continuing to enroll students. You can go there to register and take the entrance examinations. The above three universities are cultivating cadres in various fields such as military affairs, politics, economics, culture, and mass work that are needed by the new China. After graduation, the school will recommend suitable jobs. Therefore, it is hoped that you will first make up your minds to transform yourselves and go to take the entrance examinations without hesitation.
