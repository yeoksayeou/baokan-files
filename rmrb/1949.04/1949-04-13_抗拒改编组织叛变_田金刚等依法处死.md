　　Resisting Reorganization and Organizing Mutiny
  　Tian Jingang and Others Executed According to Law
    [Our Newspaper] The Military Law Department of the People's Liberation Army Pingjin Front Command executed Tian Jingang and Wang Zhicheng, former Kuomintang military officers, and Yu Peijie and Zhao Shifa, former Kuomintang soldiers, at 7:00 AM yesterday (the 12th) in Tongguojiu Tomb in the eastern suburbs of Ping (3 li east of Chaoyangmen) for resisting reorganization, organizing mutiny, and seizing our army's weapons and assassinating our army personnel. Before committing the crime, Tian Jingang was the company commander of the 2nd Company, 1st Battalion, 363rd Regiment, 121st Division of the original Chiang bandit army, and Wang Zhicheng was the platoon leader of the same company. When Beiping was peacefully resolved and the unit was ordered to be reorganized into the People's Liberation Army, they deliberately resisted and distributed reactionary leaflets in the company, attempting to incite military sentiment and plot a mutiny. On March 1st, when the unit was ordered to move from Xingezhuang to Longgezhuang in preparation for reorganization, Tian gathered his accomplices that evening to discuss ways to mutiny. Wang suggested organizing the troops to flee to the enemy area of Qingdao. At 8:00 PM, the two incited more than 150 people to flee east fully armed. On March 3rd, they were intercepted and resolved by our army in Wangjiawo Village, Anci County, and all the principal criminals were arrested. After several days of trial by the Military Law Department, Tian, Wang, and others confessed to resisting reorganization and organizing mutiny, and were sentenced to death according to law.
    Yu Peijie was the deputy platoon leader of the 3rd Platoon, 9th Company, 3rd Battalion, 806th Regiment, 269th Division of the original Chiang bandit Temporary 3rd Army, and Zhao Shifa was the deputy platoon leader of the 1st Platoon of the same company. On February 13th, the two criminals met Comrade Yao Shulin, a guard of a certain regiment of our 42nd Army, at Doudian Railway Station. He was traveling alone and carrying two short guns. They threatened him to get off the train and forced him to hand over the guns. At the side of a pit about 100 meters east of the station, the two criminals fired two shots together, killing Comrade Yao. The two criminals then seized one quick-firing machine gun, three Mauser pistols, and 130 rounds of ammunition, and fled back to their original unit. Later, our army discovered and arrested the two criminals and recovered the evidence. After a trial, the criminals could not hide the ironclad evidence and confessed to the crime, and were sentenced to death according to law. The four criminals were executed by firing squad at the same time yesterday morning.
