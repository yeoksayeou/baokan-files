　　Heighten Vigilance and Defeat Provocations
  　Italian Communist Party Exposes Reactionary Government's Lies and Conspiracies
    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 7th: TASS Rome, April 5th: The Secretariat of the Italian Communist Party recently issued a statement as follows: "The Secretariat of the Communist Party requests all party members and all sincere democrats to pay attention to the propaganda initiated by government newspapers and government representatives, which insist that the Communist Party is preparing an insurrection. This is not the first time such propaganda has been carried out. Last June and July, forged documents were published, stirring up the same propaganda. This propaganda was followed by the assassination of Comrade Togliatti. This must prompt party members, leaders of party organizations, and all sincere democrats to maintain the highest vigilance during these days in order to defeat any possible provocations. The Communist Party's position in the current situation has been widely stated to both houses of parliament and to the country, mainly to prove it to the Italian people in the fullest and most convincing way. The current government's foreign policy, which binds Italy to military treaties, is bound to lead the country back into terrible disaster. It should be gratifying to point out that the masses who support the Communist Party, as well as people from all walks of life and groups belonging to various social classes, warmly support our movement to defend peace and expose warmongers, increasingly fully understand our arguments, and agree with our arguments." The Secretariat of the Italian Communist Party emphasized: "The freedom of speech and publication guaranteed to all citizens by the Constitution means that citizens and political parties are still free to state and disseminate their opinions and political views, even if they openly contradict the opinions of the government and the parliamentary majority. Any attempt to violate this principle is a deliberate return to fascism."

　　提高警惕击败挑衅
  　意共揭露反动政府撒谎阴谋
    【新华社北平七日电】塔斯社罗马五日讯：意共书记处顷发表声明如下：“共产党书记处要求一切党员和一切真诚的民主分子，注意政府报纸和政府代表所发起的宣传，这种宣传硬说共产党正在准备暴动。这已不是第一次进行这种宣传了，去年六月和七月曾公布伪造的文件，掀起过同样的宣传。在掀起了这一宣传之后，接着就是谋杀托格里亚蒂同志。这必须引起党员、党组织的领袖和一切真诚的民主分子在这些日子保持最高警惕，以便击败任何可能的挑衅。共产党在目前形势下的立场，已向议会上下两院和全国广泛申述，它主要是向意大利人民最充分和最令人信服地证明。现政府的外交政策，将意大利束缚于军事条约之下，势必再度把国家引到可怕的灾难中，应当满意地指出，拥护共产党的群众以及一切阶层的人民和属于各个社会阶级的集团，热烈地支持我们保卫和平，揭露战争贩子的运动，越来越充分地理解我们的论点，并且同意我们的论点。”意共书记处着重指出：“宪法保证给予一切公民的言论与出版自由，这意味着：即使它们与政府和议会多数派的意见公开矛盾，公民和政党仍然可以自由申述和传播他们的意见和政治观点。任何违犯这一原则的企图，都是蓄意回复到法西斯主义。”
