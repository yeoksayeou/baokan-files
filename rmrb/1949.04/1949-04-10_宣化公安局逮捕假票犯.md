　　Xuanhua Public Security Bureau Arrests Counterfeit Currency Offenders
    [Chahar News] The Xuanhua City Public Security Bureau has apprehended all ten criminals, including Tong Yumei and Liu Guirong, who were disrupting the financial system and trafficking in counterfeit border currency. Around October 20th of last year, the two criminals, Tong and Liu, transported 80 million yuan worth of fake Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region currency with a face value of 5,000 yuan from Beiping, attempting to penetrate our inland areas and use the counterfeit money to purchase goods. However, shortly after arriving in Xuanhua, Xuanhua was liberated by us. Consequently, apart from 22.7 million yuan that flowed into the Yangyuan County area, the majority of the remaining amount circulated in the Xuanhua urban area, where former Kuomintang bandit soldiers, on behalf of Tong and others, used it to purchase goods, causing great harm to the masses. Our Xuanhua City Public Security Bureau arrested Tong Yumei and the other ten counterfeit currency offenders in early February, confiscating 17 million yuan in fake border currency. Apart from detaining and educating the eight former Kuomintang bandit soldiers who used the counterfeit money, the two principal offenders, Tong Yumei and Liu Guirong, have been handed over to the People's Government for legal action.
