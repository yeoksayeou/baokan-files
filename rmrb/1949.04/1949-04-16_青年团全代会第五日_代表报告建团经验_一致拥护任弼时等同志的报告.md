　　The Fifth Day of the Youth League National Congress
　　Representatives Report on League Building Experiences
　　Unanimously Endorse the Reports of Comrades Ren Bishi and Others
　　[Our Newspaper] The First National Congress of the China New Democratic Youth League was held yesterday (the 15th) for the fifth day. A total of 364 representatives attended and continued the general discussion from the previous day. A total of seventeen representatives spoke, unanimously expressing their support for the reports and work program of Comrades Ren Bishi, Feng Wenbin, and Jiang Nanxiang. They cited examples from their league building experiences to prove that the CCP Central Committee's resolution on league building and the spirit of this conference were completely correct. Han Tianshi, head of the Northeast delegation, said, "One-third of the population of the Northeast is in the cities, so the focus of league building is also in the cities. Two and a half years of league building experience has proven that the Youth League has played a significant role in all aspects. In the future, we must further strengthen urban work, especially the work of young workers." Comrade Chen Mo introduced the activities of the Harbin Youth League, pointing out that they closely revolve around the central tasks. "In factories, they must do a good job in production, and in schools, they must do a good job in learning." Comrade Huang Ruotun proposed that the organizational life of League members in Harbin factories should be combined with production and learning. Lu Ping, head of the North China delegation, pointed out the correct direction for league building: "We should boldly mobilize young people and absorb a large number of activists into the league during movements. After the league is established, it should support and promote the continued development of the youth movement. In this development, it will consolidate and strengthen itself. Therefore, the development process of the youth movement is the process of the consolidation and strengthening of the league." Comrade Zhou Xiaoying reported that the Youth League of the Daxing Yarn Factory in Shijiazhuang played an active and driving role in production. When the Shijiazhuang People's Government called on all factories to restore and develop production, the Youth League members of the Daxing Yarn Factory were the first to respond and worked with all the workers to gloriously complete the task. Comrade Liu Shui of the Central Plains shared his experience in league building in the new district, pointing out that before league building, there must be sufficient preparation and publicity, especially to clarify the fundamental differences between the New Democratic Youth League and the Sanminzhuyi Youth League to the vast number of young people. Comrade Liu Daosheng, head of the East China delegation, said, "The East China Youth League was established during the war, land reform, and production for disaster relief. Most of the members have undergone practical training and have made brilliant contributions." He deeply understood what Comrade Ren Bishi said: "Ensuring the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party over the China New Democratic Youth League is the decisive factor in the forward development of the Chinese youth movement." Others, such as Northwest representatives Dong Nianli and Zhang Yu, East China representative Zhang Mingxiao, Beiping representative Yang Bozhen, Inner Mongolia representative Keli Geng, Central Plains representative Feng Guanzhi, Liu Zengyi (female) from the Field Hospital of the First Field Army, and Xu Guifeng from the Military and Political University, provided a lot of experience and examples. In addition, there were reports from nine combat heroes, such as Comrade Lü Shunbao from the North China Field Army, who captured an enemy company with another comrade in the Jining Campaign. Comrade Huang Xianghe from the Second Field Army received eight model worker and one hero award. Which won warm applause from the audience. After the representatives finished speaking, the representative of the Congress Proposal Review Committee reported on the results of the proposal review: The Congress received a total of 145 proposals, of which 83 were related to the league's program, constitution, leadership, cadre organization, and transfer, etc., which have been resolved in the three reports of the Congress. The remaining 62 were classified by the Proposal Review Committee according to their nature, merged into 24, and preliminary opinions were put forward, which were approved by the general assembly. The Congress also stipulated that the meeting would be adjourned for one day on the 16th. The Congress received three congratulatory messages on the 14th, namely from the Northeast Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, all commanders and fighters of the Taiyuan Front of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and the Shenyang Municipal Preparatory Committee of the China New Democratic Youth League.

    【本报讯】中国新民主主义青年团第一次全国代表大会，昨（十五）日为会议第五日。共到代表三百六十四人，仍继续前日的大会讨论。前后共有十七名代表发言，对任弼时、冯文彬、蒋南翔三同志的报告与工作纲领，一致表示拥护。并就他们的建团经验，举例证明中共中央建团决议以及此次大会精神，是完全正确的。东北代表团团长韩天石说：“东北人口有三分之一在城市，因之建团重心也在城市，二年半建团经验证明，青年团在各方面都发挥了重大作用，我们今后更要加强城市工作，特别是加强青工工作。”陈模同志介绍哈尔滨市青年团的活动，指出他们密切的围绕着中心任务，在工厂里就要搞好生产，在学校里，就要搞好学习。”黄若暾同志提出哈市工厂的团员组织生活，是和生产与学习结合起来的。华北代表团团长陆平同志指出建团的正确方针：“应该放手发动青年，在运动中吸收大批积极分子建团，团建立之后，又支持和推动青年运动的继续发展，在这个发展中巩固与壮大自己，所以，青年运动的发展过程，就是团的巩固壮大的过程。”周小英同志报告石家庄大兴纱厂的青年团在生产中起着积极、推动的作用。当石家庄人民政府，号召各厂恢复与发展生产时，大兴纱厂的青年团员，首先响应并和全体工人在一起，光荣的完成了任务。中原代表刘水同志就新区建团经验，指出建团以前，必须有充分的酝酿与宣传，特别是要向广大青年说清楚新民主主义青年团与三青团的根本不同点。华东代表团团长刘导生同志说：“华东青年团，是在战争、土改、与生产救灾中建立起来的。团员大都经过实际锻炼，同时也有着辉煌的贡献。”他深深领会了任弼时同志所说的话：“保证中国共产党对于中国新民主主义青年团的正确的领导，是中国青年运动向前发展的决定因素。”其他如西北代表董念黎、张宇、华东代表张明晓、北平代表杨伯箴、内蒙古代表克力更、中原代表封贯之、第一野战军野战医院代表刘增毅（女）及军政大学代表续桂峰等，都提供了很多经验与实例。此外，还有九位战斗英雄的报告，如华北野战军代表吕顺保同志，曾在集宁战役中，和另外一位同志，两个人俘虏了敌人一个连。第二野战军代表黄相合同志，得过八个范模一个英雄的荣誉。博得全场热烈的鼓掌。代表发言完毕后，由大会提案审查委员会代表报告提案审查结果：大会共收到提案一百四十五件，其中八十三件有关于团的纲领、章程、领导、干部的编制与调动等问题，已在大会的三个报告中获得解决。其余六十二件，经提案审查委员会按性质归类，合并为二十四件，并提出初步意见，经大会全体表决通过。大会并规定十六日休会一天。十四日大会共收到贺电三件，计来自中国人民解放军东北军区、中国人民解放军太原前线全体指战员及中国新民主主义青年团沈阳市筹委会。
