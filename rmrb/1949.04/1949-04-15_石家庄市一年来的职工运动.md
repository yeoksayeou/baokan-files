　　Shijiazhuang's Employee Movement Over the Past Year
    Shijiazhuang Municipal Committee
    The employee movement in Shijiazhuang over the past year has gone through a tortuous path. It started with "leftist" tendencies from the very beginning of the takeover work. For example, after taking over factories, the old production system was hastily negated; and the wages of technicians were indiscriminately lowered. In cleaning up special agents, no attention was paid to distinguishing between them, and some overly "leftist" slogans were put forward in general terms, causing panic among many workers... These "leftist" tendencies were not corrected until the publication of the "February 7th" editorial and other documents last spring.

    However, after the "leftist" tendencies were corrected, right-leaning tendencies emerged among some comrades, lacking a clear idea of relying on the working class and neglecting political education and guarantees of life for workers. Some cadres held purely technical views, neglecting employee movement work, emphasizing administrative management, and ignoring the mass line in production and democratization in leadership. Some factories neglected the work of the Party and the trade union, and the Party and the trade union had no status; old personnel were overly accommodated without political education. These phenomena did not begin to change until August last year. But it was only after the preparation for war in October that the work really got on the right track.

    The preparation for war was a turning point in our work. It tested the workers and the cadres. The workers further understood and approached the Party from their own experiences, diluting the influence of "digging up Chiang's roots." The cadres further recognized the activeness and greatness of the workers from the performance of the workers. After the sabotage plot was crushed, the enthusiasm for resuming work soared to unprecedented levels. The railway factory completed two weeks' of resumption plan in an average of 24 hours; the first power plant completed a ten-day plan in two days and two nights; and the vast majority of other production units completed their plans ahead of schedule.

    Based on this enthusiasm, the Municipal Party Committee called on all state-owned enterprises in the city to launch a "increase production to compensate losses" competition. This movement was a guided and conscious action by the masses. During the process, we paid attention to preventing the two tendencies that labor competitions are prone to make: one is emphasizing quantity over quality; the other is highlighting heroes and falling into isolation. We emphasized the combination of individual models and collective models, with heroes leading everyone and helping everyone. In addition, we also paid attention to the combination of spiritual and material rewards, and implemented a tiered and universal reward system. As far as the results of the competition are concerned, the railway factory completed two months of plan in one and a half months, not only compensating for all losses, but also gaining an additional 420,000 catties of rice. Units that could not increase production in quantity competed in saving raw materials, saving electricity bills, using waste materials, improving management, and reducing costs (such as electric lights, coking, and tap water). During the competition, the railway factory alone had no less than a hundred inventions and technical improvements; Yumin Glass Factory invented the use of steam pipes to replace mouth blowing, increasing production by four times; Zhenhua Leather Factory technicians invented a drying oven, etc. But the more important gain was that the cadres began to learn the mass line of leading production (democratic discussion, planning, and brainstorming); engineers, technicians, and cadres at all levels were mobilized, and through them, active elements were united to promote production; they began to recognize the power and creativity of the masses, and learned methods of increasing production that the bourgeoisie could not achieve.

    During the competition, the Party, government, and trade union in the factory formed a competition committee, which became a unified leadership organization, and administrative production plans and enterprise management received strong support from the Party and the trade union. The movement strengthened and enriched the work content of the branch and the trade union, improved the uncoordinated relationship between the Party, government, and trade union, and promoted and improved our work in all aspects. It also promoted a number of worker cadres. Among the 175 cadres promoted in 14 units, 130 were workers. In the competition, many factories openly disclosed the Party and openly called on workers to join the Party, which further enhanced the Party's prestige. But throughout the whole process, the leadership of the General Trade Union was far behind the movement.

    In private factories, after mobilizing the masses in the iron industry, certain achievements were made in the cotton weaving, bathing, and other industries. We seized the "official talk" at the end of the year and the year-end rewards (the original habit of year-end "gifts"), opposed the arbitrary dismissal of shop employees and workers, and the determination of monthly wages. Workers, shop assistants, and apprentices formed a warm and lively mass movement. Now the emotions of the shop assistants are high, their awareness has been raised, and many people dare to reason with the capitalists and actively participate in the trade union. The work of trade unions in other industries has also been carried out.

    Due to the increased awareness of the working class and the greatly closer relationship with the Party, we actively developed Party members and openly called on people to join the Party, and actively developed Youth League members. Many active elements in the preparation for war, resumption of work, and production competitions joined the Party and the League. As of February, a total of 2,420 new Party members were added, of which 739 were employees of state-owned factories, accounting for nearly one-third. A total of 1,250 new Youth League members were developed in the city, and six factory units alone had 468. According to statistics at the end of December last year, workers accounted for 76.54% of the new Party members in the urban area (workers accounted for 56.2%, employees of state-owned factories accounted for 10.49%, handicraft workers accounted for 9.85%, students accounted for 8.2%, the poor accounted for 13.9%, and freelancers accounted for 1.7%). This shows that the Party has laid a foundation among the working masses.

    New Party members and League members generally perform well in production and various tasks and can play a leading role. The branch played a significant role in the production competition of the railway factory, Yumin, and the telephone bureau. However, because most of the stronger labor movement cadres in the early stage were transferred to administrative work, the cadres in charge of Party and trade union work were weaker. This is also the reason why the status of the Party and the trade union is not high enough and the role of the trade union is not large enough. Of course, the main problem is still ideological. The Municipal Party Committee should bear a great responsibility for the failure to adjust the cadre issues in a timely manner.

    For a considerable period of time, the fact that the factory director also served as the branch secretary proved to be not good. It easily made the work of the Party and the trade union tend to be suitable for the administrative set, and was somewhat in a subordinate position. Secondly, it could not spare more energy for the Party and trade union work. Therefore, the factory director no longer serves as the branch secretary, but the factory director and the Party person in charge of the trade union participate in the branch committee as the main members. Important issues are discussed by the branch and implemented by each system.

    The main problems existing in the trade union are that the organization is unsound, the cadres are weak, and the leadership lags behind the masses. Although the membership rate of trade unions in state-owned factories is over 80%, the leadership of the city is not in-depth. Although the phenomenon of nominal membership has been corrected in private industries, it only reaches 50% of the total number of workers, and the mobilization of the masses is not widespread.

    What needs to be solved urgently in state-owned factories at present is the issue of democratization of production management. The factory director responsibility system has been achieved, but the factory management committee has not played its due role, which is inseparable from the indifferent attitude in administration. The relationship between the Party, government, and trade union has made great progress in the competition process, but uncoordinated phenomena have been exposed again after the competition. We must conduct further review and implementation of the idea of relying on the proletariat and mobilizing workers to participate in management.

    From more than a year of work, we have experienced the following points:

    1.  The employee movement in Shijiazhuang has made achievements in production in every stage, but it has found the right direction after overcoming the "leftist" tendencies in the early stage and then overcoming the right-leaning tendencies. What we are most likely to commit when we move from the countryside to the city is mechanically moving a set of rural things and acute errors. And when correcting errors, we often reach one extreme from another. This is certainly due to lack of experience, but the main reason is that we do not have enough grasp of the general line and cannot combine policies well with actual conditions, and lack Marxism-Leninism.

    2.  The basic policy of the employee movement in state-owned industries must be to vigorously promote production, and at the same time, it must timely and appropriately solve the vital interests of the masses, so that their lives are guaranteed, and the improvement of production is closely combined with the improvement of material life. We must oppose both pure economic views and pure enterprise views. We must oppose the bureaucracy that disregards the interests of workers and the opinions of the masses. We must make the workers raise their awareness from their own experiences, so that they have the consciousness of being the masters of the country, and can enthusiastically participate in their own cause.

    3.  In state-owned enterprises, carrying out the production competition movement is an important method to improve productivity. It is socialist in nature and is a concrete realization of the democratization of production management and the mass line in production. In the competition process, the enthusiasm and creativity of the workers are fully utilized, which can not only improve production management and organization, but also promote technical improvements, strengthen the great unity among employees, and improve the relationship between the Party, government, and trade union. After the lives of the workers are guaranteed and the welfare has been clearly defined, competition is the most important way to improve the material life of the workers.

    4.  The relationship between the Party, government, and trade union in state-owned enterprises is a problem that has always been difficult to solve. In one year of experience, I feel that the key link to improve the relationship is for the Party, government, and trade union to concentrate their efforts on leading production. At the same time, we must earnestly implement the democratization of enterprise management, earnestly follow the mass line, and earnestly solve the practical problems of the workers' vital interests, so that we can solve them more satisfactorily.

    5.  In the workers' movement in private industries, after entering the city, we must first restore the production of private enterprises that are beneficial to the people's livelihood, and then we must start by solving the vital interests of the workers in order to mobilize them. In accordance with the business situation, we should implement the policy of both labor and capital being beneficial, and under the necessary and possible conditions, we should implement improving treatment, guaranteeing democratic rights, thereby expanding the trade union organization of the working masses and raising their class awareness.

    6.  We must use great efforts to implement the idea of relying on the proletariat. Objectively, due to the Party's 20 years of struggle in the countryside, it has been isolated from its own class for a long time. And most of the cadres who entered the city joined the Party after the War of Resistance Against Japan. Cadres who were of peasant origin or from different intellectuals had no connection with the workers in the past, and lacked communist education. The heroic struggle history of the working class, its class leadership role, and its great role in production and construction of the city were not understood; in addition, the enemy occupied the cities and we occupied the villages for a long time, carrying out a cruel struggle, which affected the attitude towards the class itself, and they considered themselves as victors, and even some thought that serving the enemy and the puppet was not very sympathetic to the insults given to the workers by the Kuomintang, but overly hated them. In addition, viewing the city from a rural perspective and viewing the workers from a peasant perspective, the inconsistency between rural style and urban style is more likely to produce blind sectarianism and incompatibility. Therefore, first of all, the leadership must repeatedly conduct education, loudly call on people to return to the team, and mobilize cadres to go to the factories and among the workers, so that they can recognize these problems from their own experience. After ideological examination, especially the practical education of war preparation and competition, the relationship between cadres and the working masses began to become closer.

    On the other hand, relying on the proletariat must be implemented in practical measures and must be reflected in various tasks. It requires a lot of practical work so that the proletariat can rely on it. Otherwise, there will only be empty wishes and enthusiasm, but in actual work it will be negated, as in the early stage, it is impossible to solve the problem.

　　石家庄市一年来的职工运动
    石家庄市委
    石市一年来的职工运动，曾经过一段曲折的道路。首先从接受工作开始，就滋生了“左”倾偏向。如在接收工厂后急忙的对旧的生产制度予以否定；不加分别的压低技工工资。在洗清特务中，不注意分别对待，笼统的提出一些过左的口号，使许多工人发生恐慌……这些“左”的偏向，直到去年春天“二七”社论等文件发表后，才开始得到纠正。
    但在“左”的偏向纠正后，又在部分同志中，发生了右的倾向，缺乏明确依靠工人阶级思想，忽视对工人的政治教育及生活的保证。有些干部存在单纯技术观点，忽视职工运动工作，强调行政管理，而忽视生产中群众路线与领导上的民主化。有的工厂则忽视了党和工会工作，党和工会没有地位；对旧人员则过于迁就，不进行政治教育，这些现象，直到去年八月才开始转变。但真正使工作走入正轨，则是十月备战以后。
    备战是我们工作的转折点，它考验了工人，也考验了干部。工人从其切身体验进一步地认识了党，靠近了党，冲淡了“挖蒋根”的影响。干部从工人群众表现中进一步地认识了工人的积极与伟大。粉碎了偷袭阴谋后，复工热情空前高涨，铁路大厂平均二十四小时完成两个礼拜的复工计划；第一发电厂两天两夜完成十天的计划；其它生产单位绝大多数提前完成了计划。
    在这种热情的基础上，市委号召全市公营企业开展“增产补损”的竞赛运动，这一运动是有领导的、群众自觉的行动。在过程中，我们曾注意防止劳动竞赛容易犯的两种偏向：一是重量不重质；一是英雄突出，陷于孤立。我们强调了个人模范与集体模范相结合，英雄带动大家，帮助大家。此外，也注意到精神和物质奖励的结合，实行有等级的普遍奖励制。竞赛成绩，以铁路大厂而言，一个半月完成两月计划，不仅补偿了全部损失，且多得四十二万斤米。不能在数量上增产的单位，则从节省原料、节省电费、利用废料、改进管理、减低成本来比赛（如电灯、炼焦、自来水等）。在竞赛过程中发明及技术改进只铁路大厂大小不下百余件；裕民玻璃厂发明了以汽管代替口吹，增产四倍；振华皮革厂技师发明了烤干机等等。但更重要的收获还在于开始使干部学会了领导生产的群众路线（民主讨论，订计划，想办法）；工程师、技师、各级干部总动员，并通过他们团结积极分子，推动生产；开始认识群众力量与创造性，学会了资产阶级所不能达到的提高生产的方法。
    在竞赛过程中，工厂中党、政、工组成竞赛委员会，成为统一的领导组织，行政上的生产计划与企业管理获得党和工会的有力支持。而在运动中加强与丰富了支部和职工会的工作内容，改进了党政工在关系上不够协调的现象，使我们各方面的工作向前推进与提高一步，而且提拔了不少工人干部，十四单位提拔的一百七十五名干部中，有一百三十名是工人。在竞赛中不少工厂公开了党，公开号召工人入党，更加提高了党的威信。但在整个过程中，总工会的领导是远落于运动之后的。
    私营工厂方面，铁工业发动群众工作后，接着棉织、沐浴等业收到了一定成绩。我们抓住年关的“说官话”和年终酬劳（原有年终“馈送”的习惯），反对任意开除店员工人及订定月资，工人、店员、学徒形成热烈生动的群众性运动。现在店员的情绪高涨，觉悟提高，不少人敢于向资方说理，自动地参加工会很踊跃。其它行业工会的工作也有开展。
    由于工人阶级觉悟的提高，和党的关系较前大为密切，我们积极地发展党员并公开号召入党，积极发展青年团员。备战、复工、生产竞赛中的积极分子不少人入了党和团。截至二月止，新党员共二千四百二十人，仅公营工厂职工即占七百三十九人，约三分之一弱。全市共发展青年团员一千二百五十名，只六个工厂单位即有四百六十八人。按去年十二月底统计，市内区新党员中职工占百分之七六·五四（工人占百分之五六·二，公营工厂职员百分之一○·四九，手工业工人百分之九·八五，学生百分之八·二，贫民百分之一三·九，自由职业者百分之一·七）。说明了党在工人群众中已经打下了基础。
    新党员、团员在生产及各种工作中，一般表现好，能起带头作用。支部在铁路大厂、裕民、电话局生产竞赛中起的作用很大。但由于初期较强的工运干部大部转作行政工作，党和工会工作干部较弱，这也是党和工会地位不够高，工会作用不够大的原因，当然主要还是思想问题。市委对干部问题未能及时调整，要负很大的责任。
    相当长的时间内，厂长兼支部书记，证明不好，容易使党和工会的工作偏重适合行政的一套，多少处于附属地位，二则不能拿出多的力量作党和工会工作。所以现在厂长不兼支书，但厂长和工会内党的负责人参加支委为主要委员，重要问题支部讨论，由各系统贯彻下去。
    工会存在的问题主要是组织不健全，干部弱，领导落后于群众。公营工厂工会会员虽达百分之八十以上，但市的领导不深入。私营行业会员，虽纠正了挂名现象，但仅达工人总数的百分之五十，群众的发动尚不普遍。
    在公营工厂目前急需解决的是生产管理民主化的问题。厂长负责制是作到了，工厂管理委员会没有起到应有的作用，和行政上冷淡的态度是分不开的。竞赛过程党政工关系很有进步，但竞赛后不协调的现象又有所暴露。依靠无产阶级的思想，发动工人参加管理，必须作进一步地检讨和贯彻。
    从一年多的工作中，我们体验到下列几点经验：
    一、石市职工运动各个阶段在生产方面都是有成绩的，但是经过克服初期“左”的偏向、继又克服右倾，而后找到正确的方向。我们由农村到城市最易犯的是机械地搬运农村的一套，和急性病错误，而在纠正错误时又常常由一极端达到另一极端，这固然是由于缺乏经验，但主要的是对总路线掌握不够，不能把政策和实际情况很好结合，缺乏马列主义所致。
    二、国营工业中职工运动的基本方针，必须用大力发动生产，同时必须及时地适当的解决群众的切身利益，使其生活得到保障，使生产的提高和物质生活的改善紧密结合，既反对单纯经济观点，又必须反对单纯企业观点。反对漠视工人利益与群众意见的官僚主义。必须使工人从他们亲自体验中提高觉悟，使其有国家主人翁的自觉性，才能热情地参加自己事业。
    三、在公营企业中，开展生产竞赛运动，是提高生产力的重要方法，它是社会主义性质的，是生产管理民主化、生产中的群众路线的具体实现。在竞赛过程中充分发挥工人热情与创造性，既可改进生产管理与组织，又可促进技术上的改进，既可加强职工间的大团结，又可改善党政工的关系。在工人生活有了保障、福利有了明确规定后，竞赛是改善工人物质生活最重要方式。
    四、公营企业中党政工的关系，是历来不易解决的问题，在一年经验中感觉到，党政工只要集中力量领导生产是关系搞好的基本环节，但同时必须认真实行企业管理民主化，认真走群众路线及切实解决工人切身利益问题，才能比较圆满的解决。
    五、在私营行业中的工人运动，入城后首先使与国民生计有利的私人企业恢复生产，此后必须从解决工人切身利益着手，才能发动他们。按营业情况贯彻劳资两利的方针在必要的与可能的条件下，实行改善待遇，保障民主权利，从而扩大工人群众的工会组织，提高其阶级觉悟。
    六、依靠无产阶级思想，必须用大力才能贯彻。客观上由于党在农村斗争二十年，长期与自己阶级隔离，而入城干部绝大多数是在抗战后入党的，农民出身或出身不同的知识分子，过去和工人没有联系，又缺乏共产主义的教育，工人阶级英勇斗争的历史，及其阶级领导作用，在生产和建设城市伟大作用又不了解；加之长年来敌据城市，我据乡村，进行残酷的斗争，影响到对阶级本队也以胜利者自居，甚至有的认为给敌伪服务，对国民党给予工人的污辱不是十分同情，而是过分的仇视。加之以农村观点来看城市，以农民观点来看工人，农村作风和城市作风之不一致，更容易产生盲目的宗派主义和格格不入的现象。所以，首先领导上必须反复进行教育，响亮地号召归队，动员干部到工厂和工人中去，使他们从亲身体验中认识这些问题。经过思想检查，特别是备战和竞赛的实际教育，干部与工人群众的关系开始密切起来。
    另一方面，依靠无产阶级，必须贯彻在实际措施之中，必须在各种工作中体现出来，需要用大力实际工作，无产阶级才能依靠得上，不然只有空洞的愿望和热情，而实际工作中又把他否定了，如象初期一样，是决不能解决问题的。
