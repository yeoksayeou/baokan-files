Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 28th: TASS Paris dispatch: The World Peace Congress passed the following resolution on the organization and activities of the Standing Committee on the 25th: The World Peace Congress, wishing to continue and develop the powerful mobilization of peace-loving forces – the force that made it possible for us to hold the current Congress – and wishing to unite more and more well-meaning people under the banner of peace, has decided to establish a Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress to continue the activities begun by this extraordinary gathering in Paris.

　　The Standing Committee will guide all efforts to maintain peace, all efforts to wage a resolute struggle against all manifestations of aggression, against war propaganda, and against all attempts by the enemies of peace to launch a Third World War.

　　To this end, the Committee will coordinate activities, promote contacts and facilitate the exchange of information between all organizations working for peace – international, national, and local – and all people concerned with maintaining peace. The Committee will pay particular attention to the activities of peace committees in towns and villages, factories, enterprises, universities, and public organizations, as well as the activities of national peace committees that already exist or will be established everywhere.

　　All participants of the Congress, whether organizations or individuals, will help the activities of the World Peace Congress Committee materially as they are able. The main tasks of the Committee are as follows:

　　(1) To make the work and resolutions of the Congress known to the world as quickly and as widely as possible, using all appropriate forms of publicity (reports, collectives, publication of news and resolutions, screening of films about the Congress, exhibitions, etc.) to achieve this goal.

　　(2) To obtain information about peace activities, promote the experience of various countries in this regard, and assist the peace movement and peace work in every possible way, such as sending delegations to regional peace conferences, etc.

　　(3) To denounce actions against peace, and coordinate peace forces against the activities of warmongers and their propaganda. To unite all forces in defense of peace, to stop the aggressions against the national independence and democratic freedoms of the people that are currently taking place, and to help the invaded and oppressed people.

　　(4) To support the activities of all organizations and individuals in the cultural field that are conducive to the cause of peace, such as establishing prizes and encouraging the creation of literary and artistic works that are conducive to the cause of peace.

　　(5) To organize means of publicizing the activities of the World Peace Congress Committee – mainly by publishing an official journal in several languages.

　　All these measures must always be taken with constant attention to uniting all peace-loving forces as widely as possible.

　　The Standing Committee of the World Peace Congress is authorized to accept new members whenever it deems necessary to strengthen the union of peace advocates.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 29th: Reports from various sources: Delegations from various countries who attended the World Congress for the Defense of Peace in Paris and Prague are returning home to convey the resolutions of the Congress to the people of their respective countries. The British delegation returned home on the 26th, and trade unions and democratic organizations will hold public gatherings at which representatives will report on the activities of the Congress. Representatives from East Germany, the Saarland, and the British and American zones of occupation in Germany held a joint meeting after the Congress closed and decided to establish a joint committee for the defense of peace to coordinate peace-related activities throughout Germany.

    代表团纷纷返国向人民传达决议
    【新华社北平二十八日电】塔斯社巴黎讯：世界和平大会于二十五日通过关于常设委员会的组织与活动的决议如下：世界和平大会愿继续并发展和平力量——这种力量使得我们有可能举行目前的大会——的强有力的动员，并愿有越来越多的善意的人团结在拥护和平的旗帜之下，特决定设世界和平大会常设委员会继续巴黎这一次非常的集会所已开始的活动。
    常设委员会将指导一切保持和平的努力，指导一切进行坚决斗争、反对一切侵略表现、反对战争宣传和反对一切和平的敌人发动第三次世界大战的企图的努力。
    为着这个目的，委员会将配合活动，促进一切为和平而工作的团体——国际性的、全国性的和地方性的——以及一切关心保持和平的人民间的联系和便利他们之间的情报交换。委员会将特别注意城镇乡村中、工厂、企业、大学和公共团体中的和平委员会的活动，以及各处已有或将建立起来的全国性和平委员会的活动。
    大会的一切参加者，团体或是个人，都将按照其可能，在物资上帮助世界和平大会委员会的活动。该委员会的主要任务如下：
    （一）使全世界尽量迅速、尽量广泛地熟知大会的工作和决议，运用一切适宜的宣传形式（报告、集体、发表消息和决议，放映有关大会的影片、展览等等），以达到这个目的。
    （二）取得关于和平活动的情报，推广各国在这方面的经验，用一切可能办法帮助和平运动与和平工作，如派遣代表团召开区域性和平大会等等。
    （三）斥责反对和平的行动，配合和平力量反对战争贩子及其宣传的活动。团结拥护和平的一切力量，制止目前正在发生的、对于人民的国家独立和民主自由的侵略，帮助受侵略和受压迫的人。
    （四）支持文化领域中有利于和平事业的一切团体的个人的活动，如设立奖金，鼓励有利于和平事业的文学艺术作品的创作。
    （五）组织宣传世界和平大会委员会的活动的手段——主要是用数种语言出版机关刊物。
    采取所有这些办法，都必须经常注意尽可能最广泛地团结一切保卫和平的力量。
    世界和平大会常设委员会受权在它认为必要时接受新的会员，以加强和平拥护者的联合。
    【新华社北平二十九日电】各方报道：出席巴黎和布拉格世界拥护和平大会的各国代表团正纷纷返国向国内人民传达大会决议。英国代表团已于二十六日返国，工会与民主团体将召开公共集会，请代表们在会上报告该会活动。东德和萨尔以及德境英美联占区的代表在大会闭幕后即举行联席会议，决定设立拥护和平联合委员会，以配合全德有关和平运动的活动。
