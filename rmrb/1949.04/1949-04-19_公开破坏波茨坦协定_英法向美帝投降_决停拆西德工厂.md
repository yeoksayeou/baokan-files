　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 17th: Under the pressure of the United States, Britain and France have agreed to preserve the West German heavy industrial factories that were scheduled to be dismantled. According to a Washington dispatch from the United States Information Service: Murphy, Director of the German and Austrian Affairs Office of the U.S. State Department, announced on the 13th that the United States, Britain, and France have now agreed to preserve 159 West German factories that were to be dismantled as reparations, in order to accommodate the European Recovery Program (i.e., the Marshall Plan for aggression). In announcing this agreement, Murphy also stated that the three countries also agreed to allow the resumption of production of goods that were previously prohibited from being manufactured in West Germany. Murphy said that among the 159 factories, there are 32 steel factories, 88 hardware factories, 32 chemical factories, and 7 non-ferrous metal factories.
　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 17th: Polish Press Agency news: Washington and London political figures have the following views on the agreement between the United States, Britain, and France regarding the future of German industry: France and Britain have once again surrendered to the United States on the issue of dismantling German factories. The United States originally wanted to preserve 167 factories from dismantling, while the final number is 159. Therefore, the so-called compromise is a reduction of eight factories. At the same time, the maximum annual steel production limit for West Germany has been raised to 11.1 million tons. The West German authorities have been allowed to produce aluminum, radios, and ball bearings. This solution sets aside France's protest regarding retaining three factories of the notorious Farben chemical company, as well as Britain's protest regarding allowing Germany to build naval vessels of larger tonnage. British newspapers emphasize that the result of the Washington agreement will allow some German factories to receive new technical equipment. The factories spared from dismantling are those in heavy industry and the chemical industry. The approval of naval shipbuilding is particularly deeply felt in London. This so-called agreement is related to the preparations to include West Germany in the North Atlantic Treaty. Setting the level of German industry more than twice as high as that of France aims to increase the weight of West Germany in order to weaken those who oppose including the "West German state" in the North Atlantic Treaty. German competition in the world market will harm the economic plans of the countries participating in the Marshall Plan, because Germany's production costs are much lower than those of France, Britain, Belgium, and other countries. The Washington agreement signifies an open violation of the Potsdam Agreement and other international obligations. The agreement does not stipulate any measures to ensure that Germany cannot launch aggression again.

### 公开破坏波茨坦协定　英法向美帝投降  决停拆西德工厂

　　公开破坏波茨坦协定
  　英法向美帝投降
    决停拆西德工厂
    【新华社北平十七日电】在美国的压力之下，英法已同意保存应予拆卸的西德重工业工厂。据美国新闻处华盛顿讯：美国国务院德奥事务司司长墨菲于十三日宣布，美、英、法三国顷已同意保存应予拆卸以作为赔偿之用的西德一百五十九家工厂，以迎合欧洲复兴方案（即马歇尔侵略计划），在公布此项协定时，墨菲又说明三国并同意曾在西德禁止制造之货物，亦准予恢复生产。墨菲称：在一百五十九家工厂中，钢业工厂有三十二家，五金工厂八十八家，化学工厂三十二家，以及非铁金属工厂七家。
    【新华社北平十七日电】波兰通讯社消息：华盛顿与伦敦政界人士对美英法三国关于德国工业前途协定的观感如下：法国与英国再次在拆卸德国工厂的问题上向美国投降了，美国原来要保留不拆的工厂是一百六十七家，而最后的数字是一百五十九家。因此，所谓折衷就是减少了八家。与此同时，西德每年钢产量的最高限额，已提高至一千一百一十万吨。西德当局已被允许生产铝、无线电机与球承轴。这种解决办法，把法国关于保留著名的法尔本化学公司三个工厂的抗议以及英国关于允许德国海军建设较大吨位船只的抗议扔在一边。英国报纸着重指出，华盛顿协议的结果，将使若干德国工厂得到新的技术装备。免于拆卸的工厂，是重工业与化学工业的工厂。批准海军造船一事，给伦敦方面的印象特别深。这一所谓协定是与准备将西德列入北大西洋公约有关的。把德国工业水平定得较法国高一倍以上，其目的在于提高西德的比重，以便削弱那些反对将“西德国家”列入北大西洋公约的分子。德国在世界市场上的竞争，将危害参加马歇尔计划各国的经济计划，因为德国的生产成本比法、英、比等国要低得多。华盛顿协定意味着公开破坏波茨坦协定及其他国际义务。该协定没有规定任何保险德国不能再度进行侵略的办法。
