Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 25th: After British imperialism's warships entered the Yangtze River war zone and shelled the People's Liberation Army, instead of repenting, they dared to intimidate the Chinese people and continue to provoke them. However, the British people fiercely opposed this adventurous act of aggression by British imperialism. According to reports, the British warship "Belfast" arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong on the 23rd. The London Admiralty openly stated that the dispatch of these warships to Shanghai "is for the needs of the area when necessary." A British Foreign Office spokesman said on the 21st that "British warships have the right to sail into the Yangtze River" because the British government obtained the consent of the former Nanjing traitorous government, who were in cahoots with them. The Daily Mail, a Conservative Party newspaper in London, falsely accused the People's Liberation Army of resisting the shelling of British warships as "aggression" on the 21st, absurdly demanding that "Britain must demand compensation and demand punishment." Another Conservative Party newspaper, the Daily Sketch, declared arrogantly: The British warships' shelling gave a warning to all of Asia. Britain is a "lion" and will use its teeth if necessary. Some reactionary American newspapers also barked and howled, encouraging the British imperialists to continue their adventures. The Philadelphia Inquirer said: "This has forced the West to pay attention to the Chinese Red civil war." However, the British Communist Party's organ, the Daily Worker, representing the British people, severely condemned British imperialism's deliberate provocation in this incident. The newspaper wrote on the 21st: "The British public will demand to know who ordered the Amethyst (note: referring to the name of the British destroyer that first entered the People's Liberation Army's defense line) to sail up the Yangtze River? British sons have once again sacrificed needlessly because of imperialist policies. Why are British troops stationed in China? The navigation of British warships on Chinese inland rivers is a vestige of imperialist oppression of China and a vestige of the era when China was divided by the powers." The London News Chronicle, a British Liberal Party newspaper, also stated: "The British people are asking: Why did British warships sail the Yangtze River at this time? The British people will want to know how our ships became entangled in the Communist's Yangtze River crossing offensive—what has happened is clearly this: Was it absolutely necessary for the Amethyst to sail to Nanjing at this time?"

　　英舰挑衅行为受打击后
  　英帝竟施恫吓
  　激起英人民激烈反对
    【新华社北平二十五日电】英帝国主义以军舰开入长江战区，炮击人民解放军，受到打击以后，不但不知悔祸，竟胆敢向中国人民施行恫吓，并继续向中国人民挑衅。但英国人民则激烈反对英帝国主义这种冒险的侵略行为。据息：英舰“贝尔法斯”号已于二十三日自香港开抵上海，伦敦海军部公然声称：这些军舰的开赴上海“系供该地区需要时之用”。英国外交部发言人于二十一日发表谈话，竟称“英国军舰有权驶入长江”，因为英国政府获有与其狼狈为奸的前南京卖国政府的同意。伦敦保守党的每日邮报于二十一日反诬人民解放军抵抗英舰的炮击为“侵略”，荒谬地提出“英国必需索取赔偿，要求惩处”。另一个保守党报纸每日写真报则狂妄地宣称：英舰的炮给全亚洲一个警告。英国是只“狮子”，如有必要的话，会使用它的牙齿。美国若干反动报纸亦在一旁狺狺狂吠，鼓动英帝国主义者继续冒险，费城询问报说：“这已迫使西方对中国赤色内战加以注意”。但代表英国人民的英国共产党机关报工人日报则严斥英帝国主义在这次事件中的蓄意挑衅企图。该报于二十一日写道：“英国公众将要求知道是谁下令紫石英号（按系第一舰侵入人民解放军防线的英驱逐舰名）沿长江上驶的？英国子弟已因帝国主义政策而再次无谓牺牲，英国武装为什么留在中国？英国军舰航行中国内河是帝国主义压迫中国的残迹，是中国受列强瓜分时代的残迹。”英国自由党的伦敦新闻纪事报亦称：“英国人民询问：英舰为什么要在此时航行长江？英国人将要知道我们的轮船怎样与共产党的渡江攻势纠缠在一起——已发生的事显然是这样的，紫石英号恰在这时驶往南京是绝对必要的吗？”
