　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 21st – Reports from various sources indicate that despite police persecution and suppression, the Canadian people's movement against new war preparations and against joining the North Atlantic Treaty is growing daily. Peace committees have recently been established in ten major Canadian cities. A national peace conference is scheduled to be held in Toronto on the fourth anniversary of the victory over Fascist Germany (May 8th). In major Canadian cities such as Toronto, Montreal, Winnipeg, Vancouver, and Ottawa, progressive groups, especially the Young Workers League, have used various methods to distribute leaflets and slogans against new wars and against joining the North Atlantic Treaty, despite police oppression. Such leaflets and slogans have been found not only at mass rallies in universities and secondary schools, but also in government offices, mailboxes, and merchandise delivered to stores. The Montreal police recently arrested two representatives of the Young Workers League for distributing anti-war leaflets in the city center; the next day, a large number of anti-war leaflets fluttered down from a restaurant building in the same area.

　　Most Canadian newspapers admit that under the pressure of the people's movement to defend peace and oppose war, forty percent of the members of the Canadian Federal Parliament, fearing that they would be abandoned by their voters if they supported joining the North Atlantic Treaty, deliberately left the House of Commons one after another before the date (April 28th) when the government's motion on agreeing to Canada's participation in the North Atlantic Treaty was put to a vote, in order to avoid voting.

　　加拿大和平运动高涨
  　反对新战争准备
    【新华社北平二十一日电】各方报导，尽管有警察的迫害和镇压，加拿大人民反对新战争准备、反对参加北大西洋公约的运动，仍在日益高涨。加拿大十大城市最近已成立和平委员会。全国和平大会定于战胜法西斯德国四周年纪念日（五月八日）在多伦多举行。在多伦多、蒙特利尔、温尼伯、温哥华、渥太华等加拿大大城市中，进步团体尤其是工人阶级青年联合会，不顾警察的压迫，已用各种各样的方法，散布反对新战争、反对参加北大西洋公约的传单和标语。不但在大学、中学的群众大会上，而且在政府机关中、信箱和商店进货的货物中，都发现这类传单和标语。蒙特利尔警局最近逮捕了在市中心散发反战传单的工人阶级青年联合会的代表人物二人，第二天，该市中心一餐馆的大楼便有大批反战传单飘荡而下。
    加拿大大多数报纸承认：在人民大众保卫和平反对战争运动的压力下，加拿大联邦议会中百分之四十的议员，因惧怕赞成参加北大西洋公约而为选民所弃，特于加政府关于同意加拿大参加北大西洋公约的议案提付表决的日期（四月二十八日）以前，故意先后离开下院，以避免投票。
