　　Successfully Trials Yellow Phosphorus

　　Produced Potassium Chlorate Surpasses Foreign Products

　　[Jingxing News] The Xinhua Electric Machinery Repair Factory (located in Jingxing), a public enterprise under the North China People's Government Enterprise Department, successfully trialed potassium chlorate in January of this year. The initial batch of 1,000 catties has been released and sold to Yuzhong Match Company, with a purity of over 95%. According to the experience of Yuzhong Match Company, it is even stronger than foreign products. The second batch of products will be shipped soon. According to the factory's production capacity, the output can reach 4,000 catties per month. If the market demand is large, the output can be increased to 8,000 catties.

　　The factory also successfully trialed yellow phosphorus in mid-March of this year, with a purity of around 98%, which can be used as raw material for yellow phosphorus matches, phosphorus sulfide, red phosphorus, etc. The electric arc furnace method is used, utilizing the high heat of the electric arc to distill the phosphorus from bone ash. Currently, a small 100-kilowatt electric furnace is being used, which can produce 2,000 catties of phosphorus per month. The raw materials are animal bones, coke powder, and quartz stone, which are all easily obtainable, so the cost is extremely low. After the Xinhua Electric Machinery Repair Factory accepted the task of trial-producing yellow phosphorus and potassium chlorate in May of last year, it began designing drawings, repairing machine parts, and installing equipment. However, due to a lack of materials and experience, it was only after the efforts and research of all employees that the equipment for manufacturing potassium chlorate was installed in November of last year, but the lack of belts delayed the start of manufacturing until the end of December. The phosphorus furnace also began to be equipped at the same time and was completed in March of this year. Manufacturing began in mid-March; however, due to the small capacity of the refined phosphorus equipment, the produced crude phosphorus could not be refined and shipped in time. A larger-scale refining equipment is now being rushed to manufacture. A large batch of refined yellow phosphorus will be released soon.

　　Yellow phosphorus and potassium chlorate are indispensable major raw materials for matches. The matches used by match factories in our region were originally purchased from foreign goods. The success of this trial production is a great victory in the economic struggle and a great progress in the industry of our region.

### 新华电机修理厂　试制黄磷成功　所产氯酸钾胜过外来品

　　新华电机修理厂
  　试制黄磷成功
　  所产氯酸钾胜过外来品
    【井陉讯】华北人民政府公营企业部新华电机修理厂（设井陉）于本年一月份试制氯酸钾成功。初次成品一千斤已问世，销与裕中火柴公司，纯度为百分之九十五以上。据裕中火柴公司使用之经验，较外来品尤强。第二批制品不久即将出厂。按该厂生产能力，产量每月可达四千斤，如市场需要量大时，可增加产量至八千斤。
    该厂并于本年三月中旬试制黄磷成功，纯度为百分之九十八左右，可为黄磷火柴以及硫化磷、赤磷等之原料。制法采用电弧炉法，利用电弧之高热，将骨灰中之磷蒸出，现用者为一小型一百千瓦之电炉，每月可产磷二千斤，原料为兽骨、焦炭粉、石英石等，皆为容易取得之原料，故成本极为低廉。按新华电机修理厂，于去年五月份，接受试行生产黄磷、氯酸钾之任务后，即开始设计绘图，修造机件，按装设备；但材料缺少，经验不足，后经全体职工努力研究，始得于去年十一月份将制造氯酸钾之设备按装完竣，但因缺少皮带，延至十二月底始行开工制造。制磷炉亦于同时开始装备，于本年三月份完工。三月中旬即已开工制造；但因精制磷设备容量太小，故所产之粗磷未能及时全部精制出厂。现正突击制造较大规模之精制设备。大批精制黄磷，不久即可问世。
    黄磷与氯酸钾皆为火柴中不可缺少之主要原料，我区之火柴厂所用者，原皆采购外货，此次试制成功，实为经济斗争中之大胜利，亦为我区工业上之一大进步。
