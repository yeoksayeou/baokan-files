　　Tianjin Zhonghua Match Factory Greatly Increases Production

[Tianjin Electric] After the resumption of work at the Tianjin Public Zhonghua Match Factory, the production volume for the first month (March) has broken through the highest production volume during the Kuomintang rule, and the quality has also been improved compared to before. According to the factory's statistics, the highest production volume during the three years of Kuomintang rule was in May of last year. In that month, the total number of workers in both factories was 613, the number of working days was 27, the working hours were 132,408, and a total of 2,019 standard boxes of matches were produced. After liberation, in March, there were a total of 596 workers (a decrease of 17 compared to before), the number of working days was also 27, the working hours were 129,079 and a half, and a total of 2,020 standard boxes of matches were produced, one box more than in May of last year; however, the total weight of finished products per box was increased by about 13.5 jin (mainly because 15 more matches were added to each small box). If calculated based on the same number of workers, working hours, and finished product weight, the actual possible output would be 177 boxes more than in May of last year. Compared with the production of 641 boxes in December of last year before liberation, it has more than doubled.

　　津中华火柴厂产量大增
    【天津电】天津公营中华火柴厂复工后，第一个月（三月份）生产量已突破国民党统治时的最高产量，质量也较前有了改进。据该厂统计，国民党统治的三年中，以去年五月份的产量为最高。是月总分两厂共有工人六一三名，工作日为二十七天，工作时间为一三二四○八小时，共生产火柴二○一九单箱。解放后，三月份内工人共五九六名（较前减少了十七名），工作日亦为二十七天，工作时为一二九○七九小时半，共生产火柴二○二○单箱，较去年五月份多产一箱；但总成品重量，每箱却较前提高了十三斤半上下（主要为每小盒火柴增加了十五根）。如以同样数目之工人、工作时间及成品重量计算，则实际可能的产量较去年五月份增加一百七十七箱。如和解放前去年十二月之产量六百四十一箱相较，则超过两倍以上。
