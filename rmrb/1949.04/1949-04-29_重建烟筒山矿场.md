　　Rebuilding the Yantongshan Mine
　　He Jianping
　　About ten miles northeast of Xuanhua City, countless red caves are densely arranged on the mountainsides. Many light railways crisscross between them. This is the Yantongshan Mine, which belongs to the famous Longyan Iron Mine. This mine, whose highest annual output once reached 450,000 tons, has been ravaged by the Japanese invaders for a long time and destroyed by the Kuomintang reactionary rule for two years. Yantongshan has long become a pile of scrap iron and rubble. Hundreds of workers' dormitories were demolished, the Xuan (hua) Yan (tongshan) branch line for transporting ore was dismantled and replaced, and many mining tunnels collapsed...
　　Not long after Xuanhua was liberated last year, Yantongshan began preparing to resume work. Under the leadership of the People's Government and the efforts of the workers, the power line from the gunpowder factory outside Xuanhua North Gate to Yantongshan, which is more than 2,900 meters long, was completed in the struggle against frozen ground without firewood for heating. This saved a quarter of the man-hours originally planned. This success not only brought light back to the Yantongshan Mine, which had been dark for more than two years, but also started two electric water pumps, so that workers no longer had to run more than two miles to the foot of the mountain to fetch water, and restored the use of the "sleeping for two years" big electric whistle. On February 9, the east and west entrances of the Fuxing Cave were opened earlier than expected. Therefore, the workers repaired the mine, which already belonged to them, with unparalleled excitement. Ten electricians quickly repaired seven five to twenty kilowatt transformers. Track group workers worked in the piercing cold wind. By April 3, they had repaired more than 1,200 meters of new roads and sorted out 900 meters of old roads, which enabled the ore transportation work in pits 17 and 18 to be carried out. At present, the machine room, substation, and dormitory that can accommodate hundreds of single workers have been completed. The workers in the machine room, in the case of a shortage of materials, had already installed the blower, opened two sets of furnaces, installed a drill car, and erected a shaft frame for driving the lathe. Since the end of last month, 26 workers have been officially mining in pit 17, changing the method of only transporting but not mining for more than three years. In order to quickly transport the existing ore to Shijingshan and turn it into steel for building a new democratic country, loading and ore dressing workers are running around in the wind and sand outside the Great Wall, working selflessly. When reporters talked with the workers about these excellent work achievements, they proudly said: "At that time (under the Kuomintang rule), we went up the mountain to dawdle, and didn't walk up the mountain until eight o'clock, and then took a break in the cave, and didn't start working until eleven o'clock. Now, you understand without me saying it."
　　The smooth progress of the restoration work of the Yantongshan Mine is inseparable from the initial realization of management democratization, the adjustment of wages, and the cleansing of individual special agents in the mine leadership. The mine has now increased from more than 140 people at the time of liberation to 240 people. The plan to increase the number of workers to 400 in April and produce 100 tons of ore per day is being gradually realized.
　　This mine, rebuilt from the ruins, is rapidly developing and growing stronger under the high enthusiasm and efforts of the workers.

　　重建烟筒山矿场
    何建平
    宣化市东北十里左右的一带山岭，半山里上上下下密排着无数红色山洞，许多轻便铁路纵横其间，这就是全国著名的龙烟铁矿所属的烟筒山矿场。这座最高年产量曾达四十五万吨的矿山，遭日寇的长期蹂躏与国民党反动统治两年来的破坏，烟筒山早已成了一片烂铁、瓦砾的废墟。成百间的工人宿舍被拆毁了，运矿石的宣（化）烟（筒山）支路被拆换了，采矿坑道许多都塌陷了……
    去年宣化解放不久，烟筒山就筹备复工。在人民政府领导和工友努力下，从宣化北门外火药厂到烟筒山长二千九百余米的电力线路，在没有劈柴烤地、硬和冻地斗争中完成了。较原计划节省了工数四分之一。这一成功不仅使黑暗了两年多的烟筒山矿场重见光明，开动了两台电力水泵，工人不必再跑二里多到山下挑水，且使“睡了两年觉”的大电笛恢复使用。二月九日，复兴洞东西两口，也比预料为早地开通了。于是，工人们以无比兴奋的心情修复已属于自己的矿场。十个电务工人迅速修好了七个五至二十基罗瓦特的变压器。轨道组工友，在刺骨的寒风里工作着，到四月三日止，共修了新路一千二百余米，整理了旧路九百米，使十七、十八坑的运矿工作得以进行。目前已完成了机器房、变电所和可容百名单身工人的宿舍。机器房的工人，在材料奇缺的情况下，早把送风机按好，开了两盘烘炉，装了一架钻车，架好了为带动旋床而设的天轴架。从上月下旬起，已有二十六位工友在十七坑正式采矿，改变了三年多以来只运不采的办法。为把现存矿石迅速运往石景山，变为建设新民主主义国家的钢铁，装车、选矿工人正在塞外风沙中奔走着，忘我地工作着。当记者和工人们谈起这些优异的工作成绩时，他们骄傲地说：“那时（国民党统治时）我们上山是磨洋工，八点才往山上走，到洞里再歇会儿，干起活来就十一点了。现在呢，不用我说你也明白。”
    烟筒山矿场的修复工作之所以顺畅进行，与矿山的领导上初步实现了管理民主化、调整了工资、洗刷了个别特务份子是分不开的。现该矿场已由解放时的一百四十多人增至二百四十人，四月份工人将增至四百人，日产矿石百吨的计划正逐步实现中。
    这座从废墟上重建起来的矿场，在工人的高度热情和努力下，正在迅速地发展壮大。
