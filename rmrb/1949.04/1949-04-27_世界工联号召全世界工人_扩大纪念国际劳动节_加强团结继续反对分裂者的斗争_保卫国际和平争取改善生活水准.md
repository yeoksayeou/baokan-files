Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 25th: The Polish News Agency reports: As the "May 1st" holiday approaches, the World Federation of Trade Unions has issued a declaration calling on workers worldwide to celebrate this international holiday of working people on the largest scale possible, to express their desire, determination, and strength in fighting for the common goals of the working class of all countries; and announced that the Second World Federation of Trade Unions Congress will be held in June to discuss the achievements of trade union activities and set out future plans. The declaration points out: "Economic crises and the danger of new wars are looming over the world. The endless burden of this crisis will fall on the working people. Representatives of monopoly capitalists and big businesses shamelessly say that war would be more cost-effective than the impending economic depression. That is why an international front for peace should be established to build close cooperation with all supporters of peaceful countries." "The reactionaries know the meaning of the unity of the working class and are destroying the organized trade union movement. But this attempt to destroy the World Federation of Trade Unions has already shamefully failed, the splitters have been isolated, and their actions within the World Federation of Trade Unions have met with increasing opposition." The declaration concludes by calling on all working people around the world to strengthen the unity of trade unions, continue the struggle against splitters, unite to defend peace and support the struggle of working people to improve basic living conditions, and defend democratic freedoms.

　　世界工联号召全世界工人
  　扩大纪念国际劳动节
    加强团结继续反对分裂者的斗争
  　保卫国际和平争取改善生活水准
    【新华社北平二十五日电】波兰通讯社讯：世界职工联合会因“五一”节即将来临，特发表宣言，号召全世界工人以最大的规模来庆祝这一国际劳动人民的节日，以表示他们为实现各国工人阶级争取共同目标而战斗的愿望、决心和力量；并宣布于六月间召开世界工联第二届代表大会，讨论职工会活动的成绩，及订出将来的计划。宣言指出：“经济危机与新战争的危险正隐现于全世界。无止的，这种危机的负担将落到劳动人民的头上。垄断资本家与大商业的代表们无耻地说：战争会比行将来临的经济萧条更合算一些。这就是为什么国际争取和平的战线应该成立，以与和平各国一切拥护者建立紧密合作的原故”。“反动派知道工人阶级团结的意义，且正在破坏有组织的职工运动。但是这种想破坏世界工联的企图业已可耻地惨败了，分裂者已经孤立了，他们在世界工联内部的行动遭到了越来越大的反对。”宣言最后号召全世界一切劳动人民加强职工会的团结，继续进行反对分裂者的斗争，团结一致以保卫和平与支持劳动人民争取改善基本生活条件的斗争，并保卫民主的自由。
