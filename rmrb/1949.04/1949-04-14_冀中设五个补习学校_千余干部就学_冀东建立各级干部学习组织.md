[Report from this newspaper] The Jizhong District Party Committee, Administrative Office, and 27 directly subordinate departments have formed five after-work remedial schools. 1,533 cadres enrolled around the 15th of last month. Fixed terms of study were set for each level, and upon completion of studies, graduation certificates will be issued. The curriculum for learning in various locations includes political courses such as the History of Social Development, On New Democracy, Political Economy, and The Chinese Revolution and the Chinese Communist Party. Cultural courses include Chinese Language, Arithmetic, History, and Geography. All courses are integrated with current affairs education.

[Another report] Jidong has universally established after-work learning organizations for cadres in service. The Jidong District Party Committee emphasized in its learning instructions that leading cadres should personally lead the learning process, and stipulated that the quality of cadres' learning should be one of the important criteria for judging the quality of work in various regions. The directly subordinate departments of the District Party Committee established a General Learning Committee, with the Secretary of the District Party Committee and the Minister of Propaganda serving as the Director and Deputy Director, respectively. Under the General Learning Committee are three sub-committees and seven branch committees, which are divided into three types of learning groups (A, B, and C) according to the cadres' cultural and political levels. All departments and organs started learning on the 1st of last month. In order to promote learning, a "Learning" supplement has been launched in the Jidong Daily, with two issues already published. In Luandong, Thirteenth, Fifteenth, and other areas of the district, directly subordinate organs of the district committees, as well as county and district levels, have also established learning organizations and started classes. Most have established systems for taking notes, inspections, and examinations. The Thirteenth District Party Committee has also stipulated that learning tests should be conducted each time the district or county arranges or summarizes work, and monthly tests should be conducted at the county and sub-district levels. Responsible comrades should be responsible for giving reports and answering difficult questions.
