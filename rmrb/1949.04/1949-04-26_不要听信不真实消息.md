　　Do Not Listen to Untrue News
　　With the successive liberation of Nanjing and Taiyuan, the people of Tianjin and Beiping immediately launched mass celebrations. This is the manifestation of the people's will. Such a great victory certainly deserves enthusiastic celebration. However, in the midst of the fervent celebrations, certain individual manifestations are worth noting. For example, some government offices, schools, and newspapers, upon hearing certain rumors or lightly believing the rumors broadcast by San Francisco Radio in the United States, issued special "Shanghai Liberated" editions. Some of these editions even used the masthead "Xinhua News Agency Shanghai Frontline" without any basis. While this also stems from enthusiasm, it should be pointed out that this is highly inappropriate. First, it mixes correct news with incorrect news, which will result in people not knowing which news is true. It is natural for everyone to eagerly await the liberation of Shanghai, and it is beyond doubt that Shanghai will soon be liberated. When that day arrives, Xinhua News Agency will naturally publish the news. Do not listen to any other unfounded rumors. Second, publishing untrue news or "special editions" is detrimental to the respective government offices or newspapers themselves and does not benefit the masses. In the future, if government offices need to issue victory reports, they must base them on truly reliable news. Before publication, they must also be reviewed by responsible comrades or relevant authorities. This is a matter of organization and discipline for each government office and should be given attention.
　　In passing, regarding how to celebrate victory, this newspaper provided preliminary suggestions yesterday. We believe that celebrating victory must be combined with intensifying production, study, and other concrete work. The enthusiasm of the masses is valuable, but we must soberly guide it to make it a force supporting the war and construction work. We call on everyone to work and study more diligently in the face of victory, uniting the front and the rear, and fighting for the complete annihilation of the enemy and the final liberation of all of China.

### 不要听信不真实消息

　　不要听信不真实消息
    南京太原相继解放，平津两地人民立即掀起了群众性的祝捷浪潮，这是人民意志的表现，象这样伟大的胜利，确实是应狂欢庆祝的。但在热烈地庆祝中，某些个别表现是值得提起注意的，譬如有的机关学校及报纸听到了某些传闻或是轻信了美国旧金山广播的谣言，便发出“上海解放”的号外，有的号外甚至毫无根据地用了“新华社上海前线”字样的电头，虽然这同样也是出于热情的表现，但应当指出，这是十分不妥的；首先是它使正确的消息同不正确的消息混淆起来，其结果将会使人不知那个是真实消息。大家热望上海解放是自然的，上海不久就会解放，这在今天也是无可怀疑的了。到了解放那一天，新华社自会有新闻公布，切勿听信其他一切毫无根据的传闻。其次，发布不真实消息或“号外”对各该机关或报纸本身是有损害的，对群众也无好处，今后各机关如有必要出捷报时必须以真正可靠的消息为依据，发表以前也必须交由一定的负责同志或有关机关审阅，这对各机关来说，是一个组织性和纪律性的问题，望能引起注意。
    附带说一句，关于如何庆祝胜利，本报昨日已提供了初步意见，我们认为：庆祝胜利必须与加紧生产、学习等具体工作相结合，群众的热情是可宝贵的，但我们必须清醒地加以引导，使之成为支援战争建设工作的力量。号召大家在胜利面前更加紧张地工作学习，前后方打成一片，为彻底消灭敌人最后解放全中国而战斗。
