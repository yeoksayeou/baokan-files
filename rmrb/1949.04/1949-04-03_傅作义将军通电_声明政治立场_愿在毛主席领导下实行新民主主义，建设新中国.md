Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, April 2nd: General Fu Zuoyi issued a circular on April 1st, declaring his political stance. The telegram reads:

To Chairman Mao of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, all democratic parties and people's organizations across the country, all democratic figures, and patriotic friends within the Kuomintang:

The peaceful settlement of Beiping began on January 22nd and has now been successfully completed. The region has not been subjected to destruction, the lives and property of the people have not suffered losses, and cultural relics, monuments, industry, commerce, and construction have all been preserved. The peaceful resolution of Beiping has been commended by all parties across the country as the beginning of the realization of national peace. At this moment, as national peace talks are underway, I would like to explain my understanding and opinions to all parties across the country.

In the two and a half years of civil war, my personal inner thoughts and actions, both subjectively and objectively, were in extreme contradiction and painful struggle. The realization of peace in Beiping was the result of recognizing this and acting upon it, a result of painful self-struggle. Looking back now, I feel that my biggest mistake was implementing the reactionary "suppression of rebellion" policy. When we were implementing the so-called "suppression of rebellion," although we spoke of serving the people every day, in reality, all issues involved crushing and oppressing the people. Our troops were guarding the homes of big landlords in the countryside and protecting the special privileges, wealthy families, corrupt officials, and bureaucrats in the cities. We not only protected these evil forces in the countryside and cities but also constantly created and fostered them. These various erroneous causes were reflected politically as corruption, economically as collapse, culturally and educationally as control, suppression, and resistance from young students, and socially as the increasingly impoverished lives of the working masses and the ever-increasing extravagant enjoyment of the upper exploiting classes. Externally, it was reflected in dependence on the United States, and militarily, it was reflected in a shift from advantage to disadvantage. All of these occurred because we violated the interests of the people and therefore failed to gain their support, ultimately being abandoned by them. Why has the Chinese Communist Party succeeded? This is because the Communist Party bases itself on the interests of the workers, peasants, and the people of the whole country, thoroughly resolving the land issue in the countryside and gaining the support of the broad masses of peasants. For urban industries and businesses, it implements the principle of benefiting both public and private sectors, labor and capital, eradicating bureaucratic capitalism and protecting the development of national industry and commerce. The Communist Party's advocacy of a democratic coalition government has been endorsed by all democratic parties and the people across the country. New Democracy not only scientifically explains the content of the revolutionary Three People's Principles but also accurately describes the past, present, and future of the Chinese revolution. The new era of national democratic revolution no longer belongs to the old category but to the new category, and it must have the leadership of the working class and the Communist Party representing the working class to ensure the thorough implementation of revolutionary policies and the complete fulfillment of revolutionary tasks. Since the Communists have a correct understanding of the new history and a spirit of hard work and dedication to serving the people, they are succeeding day by day. Correct policies are the prerequisite for true peace and also the guarantee of true peace. Since the so-called "suppression of rebellion" policy was completely wrong, and the Communist Party's New Democracy is completely correct, we must openly oppose the so-called "suppression of rebellion" policy and sincerely realize peace, without further hesitation, wavering, or violating the wishes of the people. The peace in Beiping is in accordance with the will and aspirations of the people, a courageous and conscious recognition and action, conforming to the correct policies and to the eight peace conditions proposed by Mr. Mao Zedong. This kind of peace is true peace. All patriotic Kuomintang military and government personnel should deeply reflect, bravely admit their mistakes, take the peace in Beiping as the beginning, and strive to promote the rapid realization of national peace, so that the country can begin its construction. Today, the democratic cause of the Chinese people is based on the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the worker-peasant alliance, uniting all democratic parties across the country, progressive elements of the Kuomintang, and all democratic strata across the country to fight together. This is already the general trend and the will of the people. Based on this understanding, I, Zuoyi, am willing to support the leadership of Chairman Mao of the Communist Party of China, implement New Democracy, and peacefully build a new China.
傅作义，四月一日。
Fu Zuoyi, April 1st.

　　傅作义将军通电
  　声明政治立场
    愿在毛主席领导下实行新民主主义，建设新中国
    【新华社北平二日电】四月一日傅作义将军发表通电，对于自己的政治立场有所声明。电文称：中共中央毛主席，全国各民主党派、各人民团体，各民主人士及国民党中的爱国的朋友们：
    北平的和平工作，自一月二十二日开始，现已圆满完成。地方未曾遭受破坏，人民的生命财产，没有遭受损失，文物、古迹、工商、建筑，也都得到保全。北平的和平解决，蒙全国各方所称许，认为是实现全国和平的开端。现正当全国和平商谈之际，在这个时候，我愿把我的认识和意见，向全国各方说明。
    两年半的内战，我个人内心和行动，主观和客观，是在极端矛盾中，痛苦的斗争着，北平和平的实现，就是由认识到行动，自我痛苦斗争的结果。现在回忆既往，我感觉我最大的错误，就是执行了反动的戡乱政策。我们在实行所谓戡乱的时候，每天说的虽是为人民，而事实上一切问题，却是处处摧残和压迫人民。我们的部队，在乡村是给大地主看家，在城市是替特权、豪门、贪官、污吏保镖。我们不仅保护了这些乡村和城市的恶势力，而且还不断的在制造和助长这些恶势力。种种错误的恶因，反映在政治上，就是腐烂；反映在经济上，就是崩溃；反映在文化教育上，就是控制镇压和青年学生的反抗；反映在社会上，就是劳苦大众的生活，一天一天的贫困，上层剥削阶级奢侈淫逸的享受，一天一天的增高；反映在外者，就是依附美国；反映在军事上，就是由优势变成劣势。所有这些都是因为违反了人民的利益，所以得不到人民的支持，最后为人民所抛弃。中国共产党为什么成功呢？这是因为共产党以工农大众和全国人民的利益为基础，在乡村彻底解决了土地问题，得到广大农民的拥护；对城市工业商，实行公私兼顾，劳资两利，铲除官僚资本，保护民族工商业的发展。共产党的民主联合政府的主张，已经得到全国各民主党派和人民的拥护，新民主主义不但科学的解释了革命的三民主义之内容，而且正确的说明中国革命的过去、现在、和将来。新时代的民族民主革命，已经不是属于旧的范畴，而是属于新的范畴，必须有工农阶级和代表工农阶级的共产党的领导，才能保证革命政策的彻底执行，和革命任务的澈底完成。共产党人既然对新历史有了正确的认识，又有为人民服务的艰苦奋斗的精神，所以一天一天的得到成功。正确的政策是真正和平的前提，也是真正和平的保障。所谓戡乱政策，既然完全错误，共产党的新民主主义既然完全正确，我们就必须公开反对所谓戡乱政策，真诚的实现和平，不应该再犹疑、徘徊、违背人民的愿望。北平的和平，就是遵从人民的意志与愿望，勇于自觉，勇于负责的认识和行动，符合于正确的政策，符合于毛泽东先生所提出的八项和平条件，这种和平是真正的和平。一切有爱国心的国民党军政人员，都应该深切检讨，勇于认错，以北平和平为开端，努力促使全国和平迅速实现，然后国家才能开始建设。今天，中国人民民主事业，是以中国共产党的领导，工农联盟为基础，团结全国各民主党派，国民党的进步人士，和全国各民主阶层，共同奋斗。这已经是大势所趋，人心所向。作义本此认识，今后愿拥护中共毛主席的领导，实行新民主主义，和平建设新中国。傅作义四月一日。
