 名词浅释 (Brief Explanation of Terms)

To the Editor:

I have the following questions and would appreciate explanations:

1.  In newspapers, I often see "price index," but I don't know what unit the "index" uses or how it is calculated.
2.  In "Political Economy" (by Xue Muqiao), it says that primitive communist society's agricultural production shifted from an extensive system to an intensive system. I don't know what "extensive system" and "intensive system" mean.

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　Enterprise Department, Comrade Enterprise Department:

Regarding the questions you raised, here are brief answers:

1.  A series of numbers representing a certain phenomenon, expressed as proportions by taking a certain number in the series as 100 or 1000 (i.e., the "base"), is called an "index." Indexes are often used to express changes and proportions in economic phenomena, such as "price index," "wage index," "stock index," "cost of living index," "trade index," "production index," and "raw material index." The function of an index is to make it easier to understand the changes in various economic situations and economic relationships. Regarding the calculation method of the "price index," for example, last year the average price of meat was 40 yuan per catty, the average price of eggs was 5 yuan each, and the average price of rice was 1,000 yuan per stone. This year, the average price of rice is still 1,000 yuan per stone, the average price of meat is 50 yuan per catty, and the average price of eggs is 4 yuan each. Assuming last year's meat price was 100, then this year's meat price is 125; last year's egg price was 100, then this year's egg price is 80; last year's rice price was 100, and it remains 100 this year. This illustrates the price situation: except for the rice price, which did not change, the meat price increased by 25% this year compared to last year, and the egg price decreased by 20%. Now, if we add these three percentages together and calculate the average index for the year, we get slightly less than 102. This indicates that this year's price is 2% higher than last year's. This is the "price index." However, because the goods bought and sold in society are more than just these three, in actual calculations, the price index for a period must include all important goods.
2.  Generally speaking, the "extensive system" means that in agriculture, less capital and labor are invested in a wider area of land. The farming methods are generally coarser, and the yield is lower. In primitive times, the means of production were backward, and manpower was scarce, so production could only be "extensive." The "intensive system" means that more capital and labor are invested in a narrower area of land. The farming methods are more concentrated and meticulous, with the aim of increasing the output of agricultural products. This is the case in many advanced agricultural areas today.

### 物价指数、粗放制与集约制

专栏：名词浅释

  　物价指数、粗放制与集约制编辑同志：
    兹有以下几个问题，请解释：
    一、在报上常看到“物价指数”，但不知“指数”是以什么为单位及如何计算？
    二、在“政治经济学”（薛暮桥著）上说，原始共产社会农业生产从粗放制转向集约制。不知什么叫做“粗放制”及“集约制”？
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　企业部莪企业部莪同志：
    关于你所提的问题，兹分别简答如下：
    一、表示一定现象的一系列的数字，将其系列中的某数字当做一○○或一○○○（即“基准”）换算，而表示出来的比例数，便叫做“指数”。指数是常用来表示经济现象的变动与比重的，一般有“物价指数”、“工资指数”、“股票指数”、“生活费指数”、“贸易指数”、“生产指数”、“原料指数”等。指数的作用是以指数的变动，便于明了各种经济状况与经济关系的变动。关于“物价指数”的计算法，例如去年肉价平均每斤四十元，蛋价平均每个五元，米价平均每石一千元；今年米价仍平均每石一千元，肉价平均每斤五十元，蛋价平均每个四元。假定去年之肉价为一○○，则今年之肉价为一二五；去年之蛋价为一○○，则今年之蛋价为八○；去年之米价为一○○，今年仍为一○○。这就说明了物价情况，除米价不动外，肉价今年比去年涨百分之二十五，蛋价跌百分之二十。现在，我们再将这三者的百分数相加而求其一年的平均指数，则得一○二弱。即说明了今年物价比去年涨百分之二。这便是“物价指数”。然而因社会上买卖的物品不止这三种，故在实际计算时，一个时期的物价指数便非将一切重要物品都包括在内不可。
    二、一般地说，“粗放制”是说在农业中以较少的资本与劳力投于较广大的土地，其耕作方法一般较粗，产量较低，原始时代的生产工具落后，人力又少，所以只能是“粗放”的生产。“集约制”是以较多的资本与劳力投于较狭小的土地，其耕作方法较集中细致，目的在增高农产物的出产额。现在许多进步的农业地区就是如此。
