Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 19th: Reports from various sources indicate that, on the eve of the opening of the World Peace Congress, the mass movement to defend peace continues to unfold widely in many countries. In Italy, thousands of rallies have recently been held in factories and villages across the country. Some strata that have never participated in the work of defending peace have also been drawn into the struggle against the military adventurist groups of Western imperialism. Despite the official newspapers' complete silence on the peace movement, peace committees have been established everywhere under the joint auspices of the Italian General Confederation of Labor, the Women's League, and Italian workers, peasants, former guerrillas, and other organizations, convening conferences and electing representatives to attend the Paris Congress. In many places, especially in Caserta (near Naples) and Southern Italy, the peace congresses have been supported not only by representatives of various opposition parties, but also by many Catholic Democrats, Saragat Democrats, and Republicans in the municipal council. The Italian Confederation of Artisans, various trade unions, cooperatives, the Sardinian Socialist Action Party, the Progressive Christian Monotheistic Movement and other groups have also announced their support for the convening of the peace congress. The Italian delegation to Paris, composed of seven hundred representatives elected by Italian social and cultural groups, enterprise employees, and local peace congresses, is scheduled to leave the country on the 18th.

In Romania, the National Peace Committee has announced April 18th as the World Peace Congress Day. On this day, factories, government agencies, schools, and many villages in various cities of Romania will hold rallies. The eight Romanian representatives to the Paris Congress flew from Bucharest to Paris by plane on the 18th.

In Czechoslovakia, following the 150,000-person rally in Prague, Bratislava, Moravska, and Most have all recently held mass rallies with tens of thousands of participants. Speakers at the rallies unanimously declared that the Czech people are determined to oppose the instigators of new wars, oppose the revival of fascism, and are determined to strive for friendship and cooperation among all nations.

In the United States, the American Preparatory Committee for the World Peace Congress announced that more than two hundred prominent progressive figures in the United States are participating in the work of the association. Elected as chairmen of the association are black historian Du Bois, St. 工会 Bishop Mooreton, and former Assistant Attorney General of the United States, Rogge.

In Canada, Dr. Wen Youzhang, an active organizer of the Canadian peace movement and leader of the Canadian Committee for Peace, and former professor at West China University in Chengdu, will attend the World Peace Congress in Paris. The All-Canada Peace Conference will be held in Toronto in early May, immediately following the Paris Congress.

Free Greece Radio broadcast that Free Greek artists and writers, in a resolution to the World Peace Congress, announced their decision to participate in the work of the congress. The resolution also stated: "All cultural workers in the liberated areas of Greece will fight with maximum effort against domestic fascists and foreign interventionists. We are deeply convinced that the 600 million peace-loving and freedom-loving people who send representatives to the Paris Congress will be able to thwart the attempts of the warmongers."
