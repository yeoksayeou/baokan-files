　　【This Dispatch】The preparatory committee of the trade union of the Shijingshan Power Plant under the Jibei Electric Power Company, in order to develop production and improve the lives of workers' families, has organized 17 workers' family members to engage in handicraft production. Seeing that the workers pushing ash carts in the factory were in urgent need of gloves, they started by making gloves. The cooperative has purchased a batch of cloth and other raw materials for them. Originally, these gloves had to be bought from shops in the city, after being exploited by merchants in the middle. Now, they are made by the workers' families and sold directly to the workers. On the one hand, the workers can buy cheaper gloves, and on the other hand, the profits are earned by the workers' families. This is a mode of production that benefits both the workers and their families. They plan to sew furnace suits (clothes worn by workers when working in the furnace) in the future, and also engage in work such as cleaning coal slag. (Chi)

　　石景山发电厂职工筹委会组织工人家属生产
    【本报讯】冀北电力公司石景山发电厂职工会筹委会为发展生产，提高工人家属生活，已组织工人家属十七人，从事手工业生产。他们看到工厂中推灰车的工人亟需手套，就先制手套。合作社已为他们购到一批布匹和其他原料。原先这些手套要到城里商店去买，经过商人的中间剥削，现在由工人家属制造，直接售卖给工人。一方面工人可以买到便宜的手套，同时盈利又由工人的家属所得。这是一种对工人和他们的家属都有利益的生产方式。他们计划将来还要缝炉衣（工人穿着到炉子里去工作的衣服），并搞清理煤渣等工作。（炽）
