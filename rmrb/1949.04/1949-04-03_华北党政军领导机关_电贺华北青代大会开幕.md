The North China People's Government, the North China Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, and the North China Military Region of the People's Liberation Army, recently sent a telegram congratulating the opening of the North China Representative Assembly of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League. The text is as follows: To the representatives of the First Congress of the New Youth League of North China, comrades:

　　Warmly congratulate the opening of the Representative Assembly!

　　The youth of North China have made extremely valuable contributions on various fronts, including military, economic, and cultural, during the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan and the two-year-plus Liberation War. The establishment of the Youth League has further strengthened the youth movement in North China.

　　This Representative Assembly opens at a time when North China is completely liberated and nationwide victory is imminent. It is hoped that it can strive to unite and educate the vast number of young people, cultivate revolutionary reserve forces, and give full play to the initiative of the youth, to struggle for the consolidation and construction of North China and the liberation of all of China!

　　　North China People's Government
