Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 22nd: According to a report from Diantong News Agency, London, April 21st: The Executive Committee of the British Communist Party has issued a "May Day" manifesto, "demanding that the British people cooperate with the liberation movements in China, Malaya, Greece, Indonesia, Vietnam, and Spain, and work for peace." The manifesto stated: "The British working class, like their worker brothers around the world, will express on 'May Day' their will to defend their living standards and peace, and to oppose the attacks of the Conservative and Labour Parties." The manifesto then discussed domestic and international issues in Britain, stating: "The Labour government wants to obtain 760 million pounds for war preparations by freezing wages, raising prices and profits, cutting social welfare, intensifying the speed-up system in industry, allowing housing, schools, and hospitals to be lacking, and increasing industrial accidents. The Cripps budget is a war budget of monopoly capitalism." The manifesto declared: "We denounce and oppose the North Atlantic aggressive war pact, which aims to make Britain a new Malta in the Third World War."

The manifesto pointed out that British workers are beginning to challenge the entire policy of the Conservative and Labour Parties. "In the struggle for peace, we are encouraged by the most sincere example of all workers maintaining peace and the people of the socialist country, the Soviet Union."

The manifesto then called on workers to fight for increased wages, reduced food and clothing prices, increased housing, schools and hospitals, the complete establishment of a trade union movement with full democratic rights within the trade unions, strengthened international solidarity of trade unions and the World Federation of Trade Unions, the right for workers to march in the streets, and the banning of fascist activities. The manifesto further demanded a large reduction in the expenditure of the armed forces; the withdrawal of British troops sent by the Labour government to Greece and Malaya back to the country, halving the armed forces, and reducing the term of military service to twelve months; the return of American troops to the United States, so that Britain may regain its own independence.

The manifesto opposes the North Atlantic Treaty and all aggressive measures by British and American war-mongers, demands the strengthening of the United Nations, and reiterates respect for the Anglo-Soviet treaty. The manifesto points out: "The forces of peace and progress are greater than the forces of war."
