Xinhua News Agency, Yan'an, April 27th: The war criminal Ma Bufang, in his ruling area of Gansu Province, frantically arrests recruits, kills people, and levies exorbitant taxes, arousing the people's hatred. In order to expand his reactionary armed forces, Ma's bandits ordered Jingzhou County to send six soldiers from each bao (unit of 100 households) in February of this year, eight soldiers in March, and another six soldiers in April. In addition, they apportioned so-called "volunteer soldiers." This spring, Ma's bandits successively established pseudo-security brigades, security regiments, and other reactionary local armed forces in Tianshui, Lintao, Pingliang, Lanzhou, Wuwei, and other places. The peasants who were conscripted into the army fled one after another, and Ma's bandits used cruel punishments to suppress them. Before the new year, three deserters were beheaded at Ankou Kiln in Huating County. In November last year, the bandit army in Pingliang County also buried nine deserters alive. Ma's bandits also ordered various counties to collect weapons. For example, Chongxin County, with a population of only over 30,000, in addition to having many guns confiscated from the people, was assigned 100 rifles, 9 light machine guns, 2 heavy machine guns, and 2 mortars. If the weapons could not be handed over, they had to be converted into gold. Gansu is experiencing a severe spring famine this year, but Ma's bandits' harsh levies have become even more intensified. Those without grain are forced to pay in silver dollars. The people's hatred of the Ma family warlords has reached its extreme. A folk song is popular in the Pingliang and Jingchuan areas: "Heaven has eyes, gods have spirits, Plague God, plague the Ma family soldiers to death, The more Ma family soldiers die, the lighter the burden will be."

　　甘肃马匪抓丁杀人
  　人民痛恨极了
    【新华社延安二十七日电】战犯马步芳在甘肃省他的统治区内，疯狂地抓丁杀人，横征暴敛，引起人民的痛恨。马匪为了扩充反动武装，今年二月曾勒令泾州县每保派兵六名，三月份派兵八名，四月又派兵六名，此外复摊派所谓“志愿兵”。今年春马匪先后在天水、临洮、平凉、兰州、武威等地，成立伪保安旅、保安团及其他反动地方武装。被抓当兵的农民纷纷逃跑，而马匪竟用酷刑镇压。年前曾在华亭县安口窑铡死逃兵三名；去年十一月，平凉县匪军也曾活埋了九名逃兵。马匪又曾勒令各县征收武器，如崇信县仅人口三万余，除被收去民间的枪枝多枝外，被派了步枪一百枝，轻机枪九挺，重机枪二挺，迫击炮二门。如果交不上武器，就得折合黄金缴纳。甘肃今年春荒严重，但马匪的苛征反而变本加厉，没有粮食的，则被迫令用银洋折交。人民痛恨马家军阀达于极点。平凉、泾川一带流行着这样一首民谣：“天有眼，神有灵，瘟神爷，瘟死马家兵，多死马家兵，负担才能轻。”
