　　Jidian Employees Improve Sense of Responsibility
  　Seriously Inspect Electricity Theft
    [Ping City News] In the past two months, the employees of the Jibei Power Company have been actively and responsibly cleaning up the lines illegally connected by the Kuomintang army when they requisitioned civilian houses, as well as the bad behavior of some users using electricity beyond the meter. In February, in addition to correcting the illegal electricity use of 157 households, the inspection department also discovered 61 households stealing electricity with meters and 197 households stealing electricity without meters. From March 1st to 10th, in just ten days, another 21 households were found stealing electricity with meters, and 271 households stealing electricity without meters. The inspections were not only carried out in the city but also in Fengtai, Haidian, the western suburbs, Mentougou, and other places. This time alone, 365 kilograms of privately installed wires were cut off and handed over to the warehouse for storage. In Mentougou, the workers were so busy that they forgot to eat. They did not return to the company until 7:30. A total of two households were found stealing electricity with meters, and ninety-five households stealing electricity without meters. Seventeen households were using electric rollers, totaling as much as 174 horsepower. On two occasions, so many electric furnaces were seized that the company's tricycle had to be used to transport them back. There are already 49 of them now. It is easy to imagine how large the company's electricity loss was in the past.

    【平市讯】两个月来，冀北电力公司的职工们以积极负责态度认真清理过去国民党军队作用民房时私自所接的线路，及某些用户越表用电的不良行为。稽查股二月份内除改正一百五十七户的违章用电行为外，并查获有表偷电者六十一户，无表偷电一百九十七户。从三月一日到十日，十天内又查获了有表偷电者二十一户，无表偷电者二百七十一户。不仅在市内检查，并且到丰台、海淀、西郊、门头沟等地去检查。这一次单剪回私自装置的电线，就有三百六十五公斤已交仓库保存。在门头沟时，由于工作紧张，工人们连吃饭都忘了。直到七点半才回到公司来。共查获有表偷电者二户，无表偷电者九十五户，有十七户使用电滚子，共计一百七十四马力之多。有两次被查获的电炉，多得必须用公司的三轮车才运得回来。到现在已经有四十九具。过去公司损失电量之大，可想而知。
