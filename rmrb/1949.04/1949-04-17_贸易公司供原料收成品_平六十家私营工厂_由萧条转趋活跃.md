　　Trade Company Provides Raw Materials and Collects Finished Products:
  　Sixty Private Factories in Beiping Transformed from Sluggish to Active
    [This Newspaper's Report] The Beiping Trade Company's Cotton Yarn and Cloth Branch and General Merchandise Branch have achieved considerable success in supporting the city's dyeing, weaving, and sand-turning industries, and have also gradually expanded the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas. By supplying raw materials and promoting finished products, the company has successively supported sixty-four private factories, revitalizing those whose businesses were sluggish or in a state of semi-shutdown. Among the weaving factories supported by the company, fifty-four in total, seventeen were able to resume production only after the company purchased their accumulated finished products and supplied them with raw materials. The other thirty-seven factories also increased their production quantities due to the support. From mid-last month to the present, the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Branch has successively collected 3,200 bolts of cotton cloth by supplying cotton yarn and purchasing finished products. Six factories, including Huafeng and Yuchang, have been further absorbed as ordering factories. The Lifeng and Huaxing machine dyeing factories in the city, which originally operated for only two months a year, have been able to keep their machines running constantly under the support of the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company. The company exchanged 40,000 jin of pig iron for 20,000 jin of iron pots from the Shengtai Iron Factory, enabling Shengtai to obtain casting raw materials. In addition, it supplied 983 spools of cotton yarn to small industries such as Wu Jixin's family sock weaving workshop, Ruishengde, Qinqi Factory, and Fulong Factory, recovering 455 dozens of socks and 552 towels. Furthermore, it purchased 600,000 bars of soap, directly assisting the development of the soap manufacturing industry. More than 70% of the finished products purchased by the trade company have been sold to the old liberated areas. (Jian, Yu)
