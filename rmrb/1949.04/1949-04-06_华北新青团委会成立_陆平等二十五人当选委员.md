　　North China New Youth League Committee Established
　　Lu Ping and Twenty-Five Others Elected as Committee Members
　　[This newspaper's dispatch] The first representative assembly of the North China Youth League yesterday (April 5th) elected Lu Ping and twenty-five others to the North China Committee of the Youth League. This committee was immediately formally established. The assembly also elected Xu Shiping and eighty-seven others as delegates to attend the National Youth League Congress to be held on the tenth of this month.
　　The assembly issued a circular telegram, denouncing the bloody crimes of the Kuomintang reactionaries and their conspiracies to play with peace. It protested the Kuomintang reactionary government's massacre of students in Nanjing, firmly supported Chairman Mao's eight peace conditions, and advocated that war criminals must be severely punished.
　　The assembly discussed the proposals submitted to the assembly by the various regional delegations. Regarding the parts related to the League's charter, such as the transfer of League members' affiliations, these were submitted to the National Congress for discussion; matters such as running League schools and publishing periodicals already fall within the scope of Comrade Lu Ping's report and will be resolved by the League Committee; matters such as training teachers for newly liberated areas will be forwarded to the North China People's Government. A resolution was passed on the spot calling on all young people in North China, under the correct leadership of Chairman Mao, to step up production, study diligently, support the front lines, and strive to complete the tasks for 1949 put forward by the North China Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party.
　　Each delegation's group discussions separately put forward lists of candidates for delegates to the National Congress and members of the League Committee.
