　　Small Suggestion

　　Request to the Power Company for More Streetlights
    There are no streetlights near where we live. It is very inconvenient to move around at night, which is detrimental to both residents and public security. The streets west, east, and north of Peking Union Medical College Hospital are also very dark. This situation is not uncommon elsewhere. I hope the power company will quickly find a way to install more streetlights.

　　请电力公司多装置路灯
    我们住的附近一个路灯也没有。晚上行动非常不便，这对于住户以及治安皆不利。在协和医院往西往东往北的街道上，也非常黑暗。这种情形别处亦不少。希望电力公司赶紧设法装置是盼。
