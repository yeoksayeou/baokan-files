  　Plans to Produce 500,000 Liters of Beer This Year
    [Our Newspaper] The private Beiping Industrial Company Brewery resumed work on February 10th. After two months of hard work by the workers to repair the machinery, it began producing beer on April 1st. Although there are many difficulties with raw materials, it plans to produce 500,000 liters of beer this year. Regarding the use of raw materials, of the 180 tons of malt used last year, 103 tons were purchased from Canada and Mexico; now, in addition to obtaining some malt from Tianjin, the factory relies on its own solutions for the rest. In the past, the factory's malt turning machine could only produce five tons of malt per month, but now it plans to increase this to fifteen tons per month. Based on the recent four-day output of three tons, it is estimated that it may even exceed the plan. In addition, the factory's official trade union was established on April 18th. It is now actively preparing to commemorate "May Day."

　　私营北平实业公司啤酒厂
  　今年计划出酒五十万公升
    【本报讯】私营北平实业公司啤酒厂于二月十日复工后，经工人两月来辛勤修理机器，已于四月一日开始出酒。虽然原料等困难很多，但今年计划出啤酒五十万公升。在使用原料上，去年一百八十吨麦芽，购自加拿大和墨西哥的就有一百零三吨；现在该厂除由天津获得一部麦芽外，其余依靠自己解决。过去该厂的翻麦机每月只能出麦芽五吨，现计划每月提高到出十五吨，根据最近四天已出三吨的情形来估计，还可能超过计划。又，该厂正式职工会已于四月十八日成立。现正积极准备纪念“五一”。
