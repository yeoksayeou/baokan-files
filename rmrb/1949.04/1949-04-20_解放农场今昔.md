　　Liberation Farm: Then and Now
　　Jidong Branch
　　The Liberation Farm in the Twelfth Special District of Jidong is located in the Yihai area of Luan County (newly established county, formerly southern Luan County), originally established by the Japanese "North China Reclamation Company". It stretches 20 li from north to south and 15 li from east to west, covering an area of 45,000 mu. The Japanese operated it for three years, but could only plant 25,000 mu, and the total annual harvest never exceeded 800,000 jin of rice. In that dark era, more than 6,000 poor compatriots were forced by the Japanese from various places to work here without pay, and all the rice produced was plundered by the Japanese. The Japanese also set up conscription teams, garrison teams, secret agents, and police in the farm to monitor and suppress the farmers. Therefore, the farmers of the farm at that time struggled in cruel days of hunger, hardship, beatings, and massacres.
　　After the Japanese surrendered, the farm was taken over by the democratic government and renamed "Liberation Farm". A special district government was established, and the "sections" of the Japanese rule were changed into farm villages. The land was leased to the original farmers of the farm village at a low price, who paid 20% of the output to the government as rent each year, and the government purchased the rice produced at a price. Thus, the farmers who had suffered so much turned over politically and economically, their enthusiasm for production increased, and production was gradually rising. They repaired their homes, and each village was completely renewed.
　　Since the beginning of spring plowing, the farmers of the entire farm are working hard to achieve this year's production increase plan, digging ditches, making fertilizer, building new houses, and repairing pigsties. A village cadre from the Fifth Farm Village told reporters that the production figures for their village last year were: 410 qiu (each qiu is 3 mu) of rice planted, producing a total of 280,000 jin of rice, an average of 680 jin per qiu. Counting each jin of rice as equivalent to one jin of millet, the entire village of 210 people produced an average of more than 1,300 jin of millet per person. In addition, they also dry salt and catch fish during the slack season. Living standards are gradually improving. Farmer Zhao Yan'en did not harvest a single grain in three years of rice planting under Japanese rule. The year before last, he planted 15 qiu of rice and produced more than 8,000 jin of rice. Last year, he planted 20 qiu and produced more than 17,000 jin of rice. His family of nine now raises two horses, one cow, four fat pigs, uses a cart, and has built a new house. He knows that a happy life is brought by the Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army, so last year he took out 600 jin of millet and 200 jin of rice at one time to support the front lines, and three of his five sons joined the People's Liberation Army.
　　Now the children in the farm also have the opportunity to study. Last year, 13 primary schools were established in the farm, and two more were added this year, with the number of enrolled children reaching 388. Under the leadership of the Communist Party and the democratic government, the farmers of the farm are building a happy life with their own labor.

　　解放农场今昔
    冀东分社
    冀东十二专区的解放农场，位于滦南县（新设县，原滦县南部）沂河人海的地方，原为日寇“华北垦业公司”所建立。南北长二十里，东西长十五里，面积为四万五千亩。日寇经营三年，但仅能播种两万五千亩，每年收获总量，从没超过八十万斤稻子。在那个黑暗的时代，六千多贫苦同胞，由各地被日寇强迫来到这里，无代价的替日寇劳动，所产的稻子，却全部被日寇掠夺一光。日寇并在农场设立了抓兵队、守备队、特务、警察，监视镇压农民。所以那时农场的农民，是在饥饿、劳苦、鞭打、屠杀的残酷日子里挣扎着。
    日寇投降后，农场被民主政府接收，改称“解放农场”。专设一个区政府，把日寇统治时代的“段”，改为农庄。土地低价出租给原在农庄的农民，每年按产量的百分之二十向政府交租，所产稻米，由政府按价收买。于是，受尽苦难的农民，在政治上、经济上都翻了身，生产情绪提高了，生产正逐步上升。他们修理了住处，各个村庄焕然一新。
    春耕开始以来，全场农民正为达到今年的增产计划而辛勤劳动着，挑沟、制肥、盖新房、修猪圈。五农庄的村干告诉记者说，去年他们村子的生产数字是：种稻四百一十个丘（每丘三亩），共产稻二十八万斤，每丘平均六百八十整斤，每稻按值一斤小米算，全村二百一十口人，平均每人产小米一千三百多斤。此外，还要在农闲的时候晒盐、治鱼。生活渐有余裕。农民赵延恩，在日寇统治时代，种稻三年颗粒未收，前年种稻十五丘，产稻八千多斤，去年种二十个丘，产稻一万七千多斤，他家九口人，现在养着两匹马，一只牛，四口肥猪，使着一辆车，还盖了新房子。他知道幸福的生活是共产党和解放军带来的，所以去年他一次就拿出六百斤小米，二百斤大米，支援前线，他的五个儿子三个参加了解放军。
    现在农场里的儿童们，也有了念书的机会，去年农场里建立了十三个小学，今年又增设两个，入学儿童已达三百八十八人。农场里的农民，在共产党民主政府领导下，用自己的劳动，建立了幸福的生活。
