　　Why We Hear Sounds
　　We hear the voices of people speaking to us, which seems very ordinary, but there's a reason behind it. All the sounds we hear are due to different vibrations in the air that are transmitted to our eardrums. If there were no air, we would not be able to hear sounds.
　　If you hang a bell in a glass bottle, pump the air out of the bottle, and then shake the bell in the middle, you won't hear anything. If you put the air back in, you will immediately hear the bell ringing. If the bottle is filled with water, we can still hear the bell, because the sound vibrations can pass through the water, just as they do in the air. Even in general solids, sound wave vibrations can pass through. If you don't believe it, put your ear to the tabletop and gently tap the table leg with your hand, and the sound you hear will be clearer than the sound transmitted through the air.
　　The vibrations that produce sound are like the ripples caused by throwing a stone into a pool of water, and this kind of fluctuation spreads very quickly through the air.
　　Sounds have different pitches, which is due to the different sizes and speeds of sound waves in the air or other substances. Short, fast vibrations produce high-pitched sounds, while long, slow vibrations produce low-pitched sounds.
　　The rate of sound vibration also varies in different substances. In air, it travels one thousand and ninety feet per second, taking only four and a half seconds to travel one mile, which is much faster than an airplane. In water and in solids, sound waves travel even faster, which is why railway workers can put their ears to the rails and hear if a train is coming from far away. This is because it can transmit farther and faster than air.

### 为什么会听到声音

　　为什么会听到声音
    对面有人说话，我们会听到他说话的声音，这看来是很平常，但其中却有番道理。我们听到的各种声音，都是由于在空气所发生的不同震动，传到我们的耳鼓里来的。假如没有空气，我们就会听不到声音了。
    把一个铃挂在玻璃瓶里，把瓶子里的空气抽出，然后使中间的铃摇动，那么我们什么都会听不到。如果再把空气一放进去，立刻我们便听见了铃声。倘使瓶里放满水，我们也能听到铃声，因为声音的震动可以从水中经过，正和在空气里一样。就是一般固体，声波的震动也能透过。你不信，把耳朵贴在桌面上，用手轻轻地敲着桌子腿，听到的声音，比空气中传来的还要清楚。
    发生声音的震动，好象池水里掷了石块后所起的波纹一样，这种波动在空气中传播得很快。
    声音有高有低，这是由于音波在空气中或别的物质里的大小及速度的不同，短而快的震动发生高音，长而慢的震动发生低音。
    声音的震动，在不同的物质里，速率也不同。在空气中，一秒钟走一千零九十英尺，走一英哩只要四秒半钟，比飞机快的多。在水里，在固体里，音波走得更快，所以铁路工人把耳朵贴到路轨上就能听到远远的火车来了没有。这就是因为它比空气能传得更远更快的缘故。
