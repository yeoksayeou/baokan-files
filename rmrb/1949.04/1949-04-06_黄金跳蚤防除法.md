Now is the time to prepare for planting vegetables. Every year, spring radishes, spring cabbages, mustard greens, and other vegetables often have their two cotyledons wither and die as soon as the seedlings emerge. This is caused by the golden flea beetle.

The golden flea beetle is a small adult insect, slightly resembling a biting flea. It is black in color with two yellow stripes on its elytra. Its hind legs are well-developed, allowing it to jump easily. The period from April to September each year is its feeding period. After being eaten, the leaves show brown spots, and may even wither and fail to produce a harvest.

The following methods can be used to control this pest:

1. Sow seeds early. If the vegetable leaves are already large before this insect appears, they will not be harmed.

2. Sprinkle wood ash on the leaves.

3. Adhesion method: Apply a thin paste or glue to a thin wooden board and place it on the vegetable plot. The beetles will jump on it and be stuck to it, causing them to die.

4. Boil the seeds of the Chinese toon tree in water, let it cool, and sprinkle it on the leaves to prevent harm.

5. Sprinkle bitter tree bark powder when the morning dew has not yet dried, which can poison the beetles.

6. Sprinkle pyrethrum powder to kill them.

7. Spray with "Pingleis" to poison and kill them.

　　黄金跳蚤防除法
    现在，正是准备种菜的时候，每年种的春萝＠、春白菜、介菜等，常在幼苗刚出来时，两个瓣就枯死了，这就是黄金跳蚤咬的。
    黄金跳蚤，成虫体小，略似咬人的跳蚤，色黑，鞘翅上有二条黄纹，后足发达，善于跳跃，每年四至九月为食害期，被吃后，叶现褐色斑点，甚至枯死不能收成。
    这虫的防除方法：
    １，提前播种，当此虫发生以前，蔬菜叶已长大，就不怕为害。
    ２，撒布木灰于叶上。
    ３，沾着法：用一薄木板涂抹稀面糊或胶水，放在菜畦上，它跳在上面，即可把它沾住而死。
    ４，用椿树子煮水，凉后洒布叶上，可防止为害。
    ５，在晨露未干时撒布苦树皮粉，即可毒死。
    ６，撒布除虫菊粉可杀死。
    ７，喷洒平得利斯毒杀之。
