Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 6th: TASS, Moscow reports: On April 4th, the Soviet ambassadors to Italy, Norway, Denmark, and Iceland, on behalf of the Soviet government, delivered memoranda to the governments of these countries (which have been invited to participate in the North Atlantic Treaty). The content of the memoranda is identical to that of the Soviet government's memorandum to the governments of the United States, Britain, France, Canada, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg on March 31st. In the memoranda, the Soviet Union sternly condemns the North Atlantic Treaty as having aggressive purposes, violating the principles and objectives of the United Nations, and sternly condemns the governments of the United States, Britain, and France for violating the obligations they undertook in the treaties or agreements jointly signed with the Soviet government.

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 6th: Helsinki, April 4th: On the anniversary of the signing of the Finnish-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance, Ville Pessi, General Secretary of the Finnish Communist Party, published a statement in the Finnish Communist Party's newspaper "Työkansan Sanomat," stating: The Finnish-Soviet Treaty of Friendship, Cooperation and Mutual Assistance is a guarantee of Finland's freedom and independence. Our reactionary groups are doing everything possible to prevent the implementation of this treaty. They are conducting anti-Soviet propaganda, attempting to undermine the treaty, in order to subject our country to the purposes of American imperialism. We will never take this path. The people of Finland and the Soviet Union want to live in peace. However, if anyone dares to attack our country, or attempts to attack the Soviet Union through our country, then we will, as stipulated in Article 1 of the treaty, "when necessary, with the help of the Soviet Union and together with the Soviet Union," fight against them.

　　苏向意挪丹冰提出备忘录
  　严斥北大西洋公约
    芬共领袖声明决与苏联站在一起
    【新华社北平六日电】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：四月四日，苏联驻意、挪、丹、冰四国大使，代表苏联政府向各该国政府（它们已被邀参加北大西洋公约）递送备忘录一件。该备忘录之内容，与三月三十一日苏联政府致美、英、法、加、比、荷、卢七国政府之备忘录，内容相同。苏联在备忘录中严斥北大西洋公约具有侵略的目的，违背联合国的原则与目标，并严斥美、英、法政府违背他们在与苏联政府共同签订的条约或协定中所承担的义务。
    【新华社北平六日电】赫尔辛基四日讯：芬兰共产党总书记威利。贝西顷就签订芬苏合作互助条约周年纪念，在芬共机关报“杜坎森·杉诺玛”报上发表声明称：芬苏合作互助条约是芬苏自由与独立的保障，我国反动集团正尽一切可能阻止实行这个条约，他们正进行敌视苏联的宣传，力图破坏该条约，以便使我国服从于美国帝国主义的目的。我们决不走这条路。芬苏的人民要在和平中生活。但是，假若任何人竟然攻击我国，或企图经过我国攻击苏联，则我们将如该约第一条所规定的，“在必需时，借苏联之助与苏联一起”与之作战。
