　　Implementing New Therapies
    How to Handle Excessive Pus?

Comrade Editor:

    We are medical personnel at a forward medical station, and we often encounter two common difficult problems in treating wounded soldiers. Please provide us with answers:

    (1) Since the implementation of the new therapies, bandage changes have been reduced, but during changes, a lot of pus often flows out, and eczema develops around the wound. Some wounded soldiers' wounds have healed, but the eczema persists.

    (2) Many wounded soldiers experience nocturnal emission, causing the wound area to turn black, prolonging the healing time. Both the wounded soldiers and the medical staff find this difficult. How can these problems be solved?

　　Medical University Intern, Jiliu

Comrade Jiliu:

    1. While the new therapy advocates for fewer dressing changes, changing dressings is still necessary when there is a lot of pus. However, avoid excessive wiping inside the wound, only clean the area around the wound. If eczema is still present, you can apply the following eczema ointment. According to our experiments, the effect is quite good, please try it:

    Mudi Oil 40 cc
    Zinc Oxide 110 cc
    Ichthammol 60 cc
    Salicylic Acid 5 cc
    Tincture of Iodine 10 cc
    Vaseline 100 cc

    Mix the above into an ointment and apply it to the area with eczema. As for which wounds require more frequent dressing changes?

    (1) For deep suppurating wounds, in addition to incision and drainage and immobilization of the affected limb, more frequent bandage changes are permissible, even once a day.
    (2) The same applies to suppurating fracture wounds.
    (3) Osteomyelitis sinus wounds: The frequency of changes does not matter much.
    (4) Putrid wounds: More frequent bandage changes are also permissible.

    2. The cause of nocturnal emission in wounded soldiers: It is likely due to the reduced ability of the seminal vesicle sphincter to contract after rest. In addition, lying on the back and being covered with thick, warm bedding can also cause nocturnal emission. Furthermore, if patients are not focused on work during the recuperation period and frequently have improper thoughts, this may also be a cause. The treatment method should be to eliminate the causes, and you can also use cold water to rub the lower abdomen, exercise frequently, eliminate improper thoughts, and avoid overeating before bed. In addition, check the sexual organs for any diseases and treat them accordingly.

    As for its impact on the wound, it may not be as serious as imagined. Improper dressing change procedures, or scarring contraction at the base of the wound, hindering nutrition to the wound area, can also delay wound healing. At this time, local immobilization, rest, elevation, warm compresses, and attention to overall nutrition can promote wound healing.

### 实行新疗法发现脓多如何处理？

　　实行新疗法
    发现脓多如何处理？编者同志：
    我们在前方医务所里医疗伤员，时常遇见两个普遍疑难问题，请给我们解答一下：
    （一）自新疗法以来，交换绷带少了，但是交换时，常有很多脓流出，创伤周围起了湿疹。有的伤员创口好了，湿疹还好不了。
    （二）有很多伤员，因遗精创口部发黑了，延长治愈时间，伤员及医者均感困难。以上问题，如何解决？
　　医大实习生激流激流同志：
    一、新疗法固然是反对多换药，但脓多时交换敷料还是需要的。但创面内不必多擦，只清洁伤口周围。如仍有湿疹发现，可涂以下方之湿疹膏，其效果，据我们的实验还不错，请试用：木爹儿四十ＣＣ亚铅华一百一十ＣＣ依比六十ＣＣ撒酸五ＣＣ碘酒十ＣＣ凡士林一百ＣＣ
    以上制成为膏，敷于湿疹范围内。至于那些伤口可以多换药？
    （一）深部的化脓伤，除切开排脓固定患肢外，可以多交换绷带，甚至每天一次均可。（二）骨折伤化脓时亦然。（三）骨髓炎的瘘管伤：交换的多少均无大关系。（四）腐败性创伤：亦可多交换绷带。
    二、伤员遗精原因：恐是休息后而引起精囊口括约能力的减退所致。此外患者仰卧，盖的过厚、过暖，均可引起遗精。再者为患者在休养期对工作等无所用心，常生邪念，亦可能为其原因。治法可针对其原因而除去之，并可用冷水摩擦下腹部，勤运动，去邪念，睡前勿过饱。此外，可检查其性器官有无疾患治疗之即可。
    至其对伤口之影响，恐不会如所想象的那样严重。可能因换药操作不当，或因伤之基底瘢痕收缩，伤区营养受碍，亦可使创面迟延不愈。此时可局部固定安静高举，热敷，并注意其全身营养等，即可促成伤口之愈合。
