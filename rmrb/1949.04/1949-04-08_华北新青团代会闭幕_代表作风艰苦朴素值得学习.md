The North China New Youth League Congress Concludes
Representatives' Austere and Simple Style Worthy of Study

[Our Newspaper] The First Congress of the New Democratic Youth League of China in North China successfully concluded yesterday (April 7th). The congress determined the future direction and tasks of the New Democratic Youth League in North China, selected North China representatives to attend the National Youth League Congress, and formally established the unified leadership organ of the North China Youth League—the North China Committee of the New Democratic Youth League. The congress also sent a respectful telegram to Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu. In addition, after exchanging experiences in establishing leagues in various regions, listening to reports on the future direction and tasks of the North China League, and conducting in-depth discussions, the representatives further understood the spirit of the CCP Central Committee and the North China Bureau's resolutions on establishing leagues, and clearly recognized that the important task of the Youth League is to study. When discussing tasks, directions, and electing the League Committee, the representatives fully demonstrated unity of thought and concentration of will, and also demonstrated a high degree of enthusiasm and a spirit of responsibility towards the Youth League and the people. Furthermore, the representatives voluntarily requested to lower food standards, further promoting a spirit of hard work and simplicity. During the closing ceremony, ten Tianjin workers attending as observers requested to join the League. They were outstanding young workers from Tianjin Zhongfang Textile Factory, Telecommunications Bureau, and other units, and were recommended by the Tianjin Federation of Trade Unions to apply for membership. When the presidium announced that the North China League Committee had approved their membership, the entire venue erupted in applause. Their representative, Chen Dazhao, said: He was very excited today to have found his organization, and in the future, he must accept the League's education, receive training in Marxism-Leninism, and better serve the people.

[Our Newspaper] The Youth League members from all over North China who participated in the North China Representative Meeting of the Youth League lived a simple life, worked hard, and voluntarily requested the preparatory committee to lower their living standards, fully demonstrating a spirit of responsibility to the people.

Their meals were originally two "half-meat dishes," one vegetable dish, and one soup. Later, after the Taihang and Taiyue regions' delegations proposed and other delegations unanimously agreed, they requested the preparatory committee to lower the standard to one vegetable dish, one "half-meat dish," and one soup. The representative from the Taihang region said: "Our original living standards in the base areas and after entering the city were not high. Now that we are still fighting, it would increase the burden on the people if we eat too well." They mentioned that when the North China Youth Representative Meeting was held last November, they ate one meal of fine grains and one meal of coarse grains, and now eating two meals of fine grains is already too good. They lived in the Beichengong Hotel, the Dongya Hotel, and the third courtyard of Yuying Middle School. In the Beichengong Hotel, the representatives living upstairs slept on the floor. A room for two people slept five to six people, and the living room was also full, sleeping nearly thirty people. The representatives living in the Dongya Hotel had two to three people in single rooms. In Yuying Middle School, each room had a communal bed sleeping eight or nine people. The representatives got their hair cut in a simple small shop, without hair oil, for fifteen yuan each time. During the entire congress, they had one dinner, which only added a few dishes. In addition, when the CCP North China Bureau wanted to invite all the representatives to a dinner, they declined and, while accelerating their study, only accepted the "Concise Philosophical Dictionary" and "Concise International Knowledge Dictionary" two books that the North China Bureau changed to send them.

    【本报讯】来自华北各地参加青年团华北代表会议的青年团员，生活朴素，作风艰苦，自动要求筹委会降低他们的生活待遇，充分发扬了对人民负责的精神。
    他们的伙食原来是两个“半荤菜”，一个素菜和一个汤，后经太行、太岳两区代表团提出和其他代表团一致的同意，要求筹委会降低标准，改为一个素菜，一个“半荤菜”和一个汤。太行区的代表说：“咱们原来在根据地和进城以后的生活标准都不高，现在还在作战，我们吃得太好了，都会增加人民的负担”。他们提到去年十一月华北青年代表会议开会时，吃的是一顿细粮和一顿粗粮，现在吃两顿细粮已经太好了。他们分别住在北辰宫饭店、东亚饭店和育英中学的三院，在北辰宫饭店，住在楼上的代表都睡地板，一个两人房间睡了五个人到六个人，连客厅里也满满睡了近三十个人。住在东亚饭店的代表，单人房间都住了两个人到三个人，在育英中学则每个房间打通铺住八个人或九个人。代表们理发是在一家简陋的小店里，不上油，每次十五元。在整个大会期间他们会过一次餐，也只是加了几个菜而已。此外，当中共华北局要请全体代表聚餐时，他们谢绝了，在加紧学习的前提下，只收下了华北局改送他们的“简明哲学辞典”和“国际知识小辞典”两本书。
