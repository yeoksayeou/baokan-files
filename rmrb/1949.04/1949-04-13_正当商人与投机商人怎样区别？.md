　　How to Distinguish Between Legitimate Merchants and Speculative Merchants?

    We have a question and would like you to answer it. In our study, we discussed the issue of loans, specifically not lending to merchants engaged in "speculation and profiteering." After discussion, we believe that merchants themselves are speculative in nature; if they don't speculate, they can't make money. Some say that merchants who cause market price fluctuations are considered "speculators and profiteers," and if that's the case, there would be very few "speculators and profiteers." Others say that those who don't engage in their own line of business (e.g., cloth merchants buying grain) are "speculators and profiteers," and if that's the case, there would be too many "speculators and profiteers." As a result, our understanding of the scope of "speculation and profiteering" is unclear. Please provide a detailed explanation and some examples.

Zhou Zongyuan, Zhang Weifan, and Jin Botao, Comrades:

    The answer to your question is as follows: The standard for distinguishing between legitimate merchants and speculative merchants is whether their operations comply with national policies and laws. Those who engage in adjusting industrial and agricultural products and promoting the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas within the framework of national policies and laws are called legitimate merchants. Conversely, those who hoard goods to seek high profits (i.e., speculate), manipulate prices (i.e., engage in profiteering), cause price fluctuations, disrupt the market, and undermine national policies and laws are speculative merchants. We allow the former to develop, while the latter must be restricted.

### 正当商人与投机商人怎样区别？

专栏：询问与答复

　　正当商人与投机商人怎样区别？
    我们有一个问题，请给解答一下。就是在学习当中讨论到贷款问题，不贷给“投机倒把”的商人。经我们大家讨论：商人本身都是投机性的，如不投机就赚不了钱，有的人说：能引起市场物价波动的商人，才算“投机倒把”，如这样说“投机倒把”就很少很少了。又有人说：不做本行营业的（如布商买粮等）就是“投机倒把”，如这样说“投机倒把”的就太多了。结果我们思想上对“投机倒把”的范围还不明确，请详细解答，并希举出几种类型来。
    　　　　　　　人民银行太原分行读者周宗元、张维藩、靳伯韬周宗元、张维藩、靳伯韬同志：
    你们所询问题答复如下：区别正当商人与投机商人的标准，是看他的经营是否服从国家的政策与法令。凡在国家的政策法令之下，从事于调剂工农产品，促进城乡物资交流的经营者，都叫正当商人。反之，为谋取高利，而囤积居奇（即投机），玩弄价格（即倒把），波动物价，捣乱市场，破坏国家的政策与法令的，就是投机商人。对于前者，我们允许其发展，对于后者，须加以限制。
