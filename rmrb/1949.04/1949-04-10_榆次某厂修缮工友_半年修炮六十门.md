    Yuci Factory Repair Workers
    Repair Sixty Cannons in Half a Year

    [Jinzhong Telegram] Since the liberation of the Jinzhong Campaign (last July), repair workers at a factory in Yuci have, according to incomplete statistics, repaired sixty cannons of various types, twelve machine guns of various models, sixty-four rifles and carbines, one artillery sight, eleven gun carriages, and many military equipment in the past six months. In order to quickly supply the front lines, the workers often automatically work overtime and increase their speed. For example, during the tense Taiyuan siege campaign at the end of last year, the factory received an emergency task to repair howitzers at 6 p.m. one day. Under normal circumstances, it would take three workers three days, but workers Zhao Renfu, Jia Qiling, Wei Changshou, Liu Yi, Shuai Yuhe and others worked from 7 p.m. to 11 p.m., completing the repair in four hours. When worker Wei Changshou was repairing the Type 36 mountain gun, he failed twice. Someone suggested using cast iron to recast it, but he said that cast iron is easy to break, and if something goes wrong at a critical moment in the battle, the loss to the revolution would be too great! After his hard work and research, he finally succeeded in the third repair.

　　榆次某厂修缮工友
  　半年修炮六十门
    【晋中电】榆次某厂修缮工友，自晋中战役解放后（去年七月），据不完全统计，半年来已修理各种炮六十门，名式机枪十二挺，长短枪六十四支，炮镜一架，炮架十一座及许多军用器械。为了迅速供应前线，工友常自动加工及增强速度。如去年年底紧张的太原外围战役中，该厂于某日下午六时接受了修理榴弹炮的紧急任务，按一般情况需三个工人的三天时间，但工友赵仁甫、贾奇玲、魏长寿、刘义、帅玉和等从下午七时至夜间十一时，四小时即赶修完竣。案工魏长寿修理三十六式山炮时，两次未成功，有人建议以生铁翻砂铸造，他说生铁翻砂容易断，在作战紧要关头出了毛病，对革命的损失就太大了！在他努力钻研下，终于第三次修理成功。
