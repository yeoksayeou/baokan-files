　　Exchange Rate for Areas Outside the Region Rises Again
    [Our dispatch] The exchange rate for areas outside the region quoted by the Bank of China will be revised to 1:420 starting today (the 20th), the remittance fee remains unchanged.
    Exchange for areas outside the region: This refers to the exchange between the Liberated Areas and the Kuomintang-controlled areas. Because the currencies of the two areas are different, a certain exchange rate must be determined according to the currency value when there is an exchange relationship between them. For example, 1:420 means that one RMB yuan can be exchanged for 420 pseudo-gold yuan. That is, if a remitter in the Liberated Area remits one yuan to the Kuomintang area through the bank, the recipient in the Kuomintang area can withdraw 420 pseudo-gold yuan from the bank, and so on.

　　区外汇兑牌价再升
    【本报讯】中国银行区外汇兑牌价今（二十日）起改订为一比四二○，汇水仍未变。
    区外汇兑：即是指解放区对国民党统治区的汇兑。因为两区货币不同，故在彼此间有汇兑关系时，必须按照币值确定一定的比价。如一比四二○便是人民券一元兑换伪金圆券四百二十元。即在解放区汇款人从银行汇款一元到国民党区，则国民党区受款人可以从银行取到伪金圆券四百二十元，余依此类推。
