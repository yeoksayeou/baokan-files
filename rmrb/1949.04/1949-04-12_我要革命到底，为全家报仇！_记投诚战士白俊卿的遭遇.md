　　“I will carry the revolution through to the end to avenge my whole family!”
    —An account of the experiences of defector Bai Junqing
    Guo Feng
    I am a homeless person now. My family was harmed by the landlords and the Kuomintang reactionaries, leaving only me. Now the People's Liberation Army is my home. As long as I have a breath left, I will follow the Communist Party and carry the revolution through to the end!
    I am Bai Junqing from Wangjiaying, Salachi County, Suiyuan Province, and I am twenty-two years old this year. My father suffered from a young age in the Qi family. When my mother gave birth to me, my father's taking care of my mother during her confinement period delayed his work for a few days. The manager came to the door and shouted as soon as he entered, "Bai Qishi! Pay back the money you owe, I don't need you anymore! I've already hired someone else." My father was still kowtowing and begging him, but the manager waved his hand and called in a few people to take away our family's pot and move the cabinet. My mother was so angry that she cried for a long time and died of illness. She left me and my four-year-old brother, two motherless children.
    At that time, poor people couldn't talk about "ambition." In order to support the children, my father went back to work for the Qi family. When I was nine years old, my father was guarding a dam for the Qi family. Outside the dam was a large expanse of water, and the land inside the dam was so wet that people sank when they stepped on it. My father laid some grass on the ground and lived there day and night. In less than half a month, my father became ill. At first, he always said it was okay, but after half a month, he told the manager, "I really can't do it anymore!" The Qi family sent my father back. As soon as we met, my brother and I couldn't recognize who my father was. My father was swollen all over like he was blown up like a balloon, his arms as thick as bowls, and his face was frighteningly swollen. My father suffered so much for the Qi family and got sick like this, but the Qi family didn't even ask a question.
    My brother was only thirteen years old that year and had already worked as a young farmhand for three or four years. He told me to stay at home and take care of my father, and he suffered outside to support our family. My father was sick for more than two years and died when I was eleven years old. Before he died, my father grabbed my and my brother's arms and said, "My life is not good, I suffered all my life, and I couldn't even earn a coffin!" He touched the mat under his body and said, "Just wrap me up in this mat." After my father died, my brother spent seventy yuan from the Shang family to buy a coffin and bury him.
    The Shang family was a big landlord with more than forty acres of land. My brothers worked hard for his family for two years to pay off that coffin debt. I was young and herded cattle for him. One day, I was only interested in cutting grass, and the livestock ate the crops. The manager picked up a stick and beat me without rhyme or reason. I was so scared that I ran out of the gate and ran in the wilderness for two days, eating raw wild yams when I was hungry. I came back on the third day and met my brother on the edge of the village. He ran over and hugged me, crying, "I thought you had been eaten by wolves." My brothers cried for a whole day. Then and there, we settled accounts with the Shang family and went to work for others. When I was fifteen years old, my brother, pointing to the two rooms under him, borrowed five hundred yuan from the Wang family to marry me a wife. The IOU stated that my brothers would work hard to pay off the debt. Unexpectedly, less than ten days after the woman married into the family, the Kuomintang bandit army's 31st Division arrested my brother. Two days later, the Wang family drove two large carts into the yard and called out my childhood name, saying, "Zai Geng! Bring money if you have it, if you don't have money, we'll tear down the house!" I quickly begged them, "Manager Wang, I'll work hard to pay you back in a few days, if I can't pay it off in one year, then two years!" That person spoke in a loud voice, "We don't want you to work hard either! When your brother was here, the two of you couldn't pay it off, now that your brother has joined the army, your words are worthless!" While speaking, he ordered people to start tearing down the house. Before I could move all the bedding out, the house collapsed. Finally, they even removed the bricks paved in the yard and pulled them away in a car. From then on, my woman and I had no place to live, so we had to go to my aunt's house to borrow lodging.
    More than a month after my brother left, the team sent a letter home saying that my brother was dead. Crying, I borrowed a cart from my uncles and went to Yinjia Kiln to claim the body. It was the third day after my brother died. We dug out his body from the dilapidated house. His face was already black and blue. He had nothing on his upper body, and only a pair of torn pants on his lower body. I turned the body over and saw that my brother's legs had rotted into bloody holes, exposing white bones, and maggots were crawling all over the rotten flesh. A company commander came out and saw us and scolded, "You people here are really worthless! You don't work hard and try to desert! Do you think you can escape?" At this time, I learned that my brother was killed because he was thinking about his "poor" family and was caught deserting by the team!
    The Kuomintang hadn't harmed my family enough! It arrested my brother in May, beat him to death in June, and arrested me in August, tying me up for fourteen days. When eating, they untied one arm, and tied it up again after eating. Later, they sent me to Wuyuan and assigned me to the Second Company directly under the 17th Replenishment Training Division. After the Kuomintang bandit army occupied Jining, we moved there to garrison. During the day, the training was so tiring that my legs couldn't climb up the bed. When sleeping in the winter, we took off our cotton pants and each covered ourselves with a cotton coat with our bare buttocks. When getting up at night to relieve ourselves, we had to shout one-two-one to let the guards hear us. Even so, the soldiers were still constantly looking for opportunities to run away. When someone ran away, the squad leader and soldiers would be beaten. The squad leader received forty blows, the deputy squad leader thirty-five blows, and each soldier twenty blows. If the deserter was caught and brought back, the whole company would give him fifteen blows each. In the nine months we lived in Jining, more than twenty people were beaten to death. A man surnamed Li from the Third Platoon, also from Sa County, was caught and brought back after deserting. The whole company lined up to beat him in turn. After he was beaten to death, they splashed cold water on him, carried him around a few times, pressed him to the ground and beat him again. He shouted "Dad!" "Mom!" I stood at the back of the line, shivering. Finally, my name was called, and I was startled. When I picked up the stick, I thought of my dead brother. How could I bear to do it! I raised the stick high and lowered it gently, but the company commander saw it. He snatched the stick and said, "You don't know how to hit, I'll teach you!" With that, he hit my back twice with a crack, and two red welts immediately swelled up. Tears in my eyes, I said, "I learned it, I learned it." I took the stick and went to beat that brother. At this time, I realized that the soldiers in the Kuomintang army were all oppressed! I lived this kind of life of a beast of burden for more than four years. I secretly sent a letter home from Erliban Village in Baotou, and my woman replied, "The family is in difficulty, you can come back if you can, if you can't come back, I will find another way." The company commander saw this letter and put me in solitary confinement for seven days, saying that I was going to desert. I hardened my heart: "I won't write letters! Anyway, I can't control whether the family lives or dies, let her go, she should live!"
    I always thought that I would never be able to get out of this for the rest of my life, but unexpectedly, in February, the People's Liberation Army liberated Tianzhen and liberated me. I was covered in scabies, and the People's Liberation Army sent me to Shidaogou Village in Laiyuan to recuperate, where I lived for more than ten days. The landlord, Li Yuan, was an old man in his forties. He boiled water for us early in the morning and heated the bed for us at night. I was very surprised: How could the people in the liberated areas be so good? The old man told me, "I used to be a sufferer, but now I have overthrown the big landlords and divided four or five acres of land and a donkey. I have turned over! I am no longer oppressed, all thanks to the People's Liberation Army. The People's Liberation Army is fighting for us, and it is right for us to help the People's Liberation Army."
    In March, the People's Liberation Army gave me travel expenses and let me go home. I found an older female cousin’s home. She ran a butcher shop in Tianzhen city, and I joined them in trafficking livestock. On August 18th, a group of six of us driving two hundred and fifty sheep passed by Yongjiabao and were caught by the Kuomintang again with the people and sheep. I was assigned to the 13th Road Protection Regiment as a soldier again. In October, when the People's Liberation Army captured Huayuan, I killed the platoon leader, pulled together more than thirty people, and took four machine guns and a small cannon, and ran to Shalingzi Station to surrender to the People's Liberation Army.
    When I arrived at the People's Liberation Army, a comrade asked me, "Are you going home, or are you joining the army?" I said, "I have no home, I want to join the People's Liberation Army." I was assigned to our company. The first night we arrived at the company headquarters, the instructor gave us water to wash our faces. At mealtime, a tall comrade served us food. The next day at roll call, I learned that he was the company commander! I remembered that when I first joined the army, the Kuomintang tied me up for fourteen days, and the company commander over there either beat me or scolded me. When I arrived in the squad, a platoon leader (major meritorious soldier Zhang Benliang) talked to me: "I used to work on the enemy's side, I have been a platoon leader for more than a year since liberation. If you work hard in the People's Liberation Army, there is a way out." The deputy battalion commander (special meritorious soldier Li Guoying) also talked to me: "I used to be a poor man, and I begged for food with my mother when I was young. Now I have turned over, and all three of my brothers have joined the People's Liberation Army. I have made special contributions, and the government congratulated my family, and my mother also became honored!" Later, the instructor lectured: "The troops led by the Communist Party serve the suffering people, and the Kuomintang army is for the big landlords." I recalled what I had encountered in the past twenty years, and it was indeed the case.
    I am also a sufferer! I was beaten and bullied on the Kuomintang side and worked for them for several years, so why shouldn't I work hard now that I'm in my own ranks?! I listened to other comrades complain, and I realized that I am not the only sufferer in China, some are even more miserable than me. This suffering is all caused by the landlords and the Kuomintang. The landlords are the root of the Kuomintang reactionaries, and Chiang Kai-shek is the leader of the big landlords. If they are not wiped out, the suffering people should not think about living a good life. Now I understand what revolution is, who revolution is for. I will follow the Communist Party forever. My goal is to liberate all the suffering people in China and avenge my dead parents and brother! (Attached picture)

　　“我要革命到底，为全家报仇！”
    ——记投诚战士白俊卿的遭遇
    郭锋
    我是个无家可归的人啦，我的家给地主和国民党反动派害得只留下我一个根，现在解放军就是我的家。我只要有口活气，就要跟随着共产党革命到底！
    我是绥远省萨拉齐县王家营人，今年二十二岁。爹从小给齐家受苦。娘生我时，爹服侍娘的月子误了几天工。掌柜找到门上来了，一进门就喊：“白旗世！把你长支下的钱还我吧，我不用你啦！我已雇下旁人了。”爹还在磕头央求人家，掌柜却一摆手叫进几个人来把我家的锅端了，柜也搬走了。娘气得哭了半天，当下就得病死了。抛下我和四岁的哥哥，两个没娘孩儿。
    那时，穷人是不能谈“志气”的，爹为了养活娃娃，又找到齐家受苦去了。我九岁那年，爹给齐家守坝，坝外边是一片大水，坝里边的地，人一踩呼吃呼吃的，湿得不行。爹就在地上铺点草，黑家白日住在那里，不到半个月爹就病了，开头他总说不要紧，忍过半个月才跟掌柜说：“我实在干不了啦！”齐家把爹送回来。刚一见面，我和我哥都认不出爹是谁来了。爹混身肿得象气吹“胖”的一样，胳臂有碗口粗，脸肿的怕人。爹给齐家受苦病成这样子，齐家连问一句也没问过。
    哥那年才十三岁，已经拦了三四年小长工，他让我留在家里侍候爹，他一个人在外边受苦养活我爷俩。爹病了两年多，到我十一岁那年就死了。临死前，爹用手抓住我和哥的胳臂说：“爹的命不好，受了一辈子苦，连口棺材也没挣上！”他摸摸身底下的炕席说；“用这领席把我卷上就得了。”爹死后，哥使了尚家七十块钱，买了口棺材把他发丧了。
    尚家是个大地主，家有四十多顷地。我兄弟俩给他家受了两年苦，才顶齐那笔棺材帐。我年纪小，给他放牛。有一天，我光顾割草，牲口吃了庄稼，掌柜的拉起棍子，没头没脸的就打，我吓得跑出大门，在野地里跑了两天，饿了就刨生山药蛋吃。第三天回来了，在村边碰见了我哥。跑过去，他把我抱住哭着说：“我当你给狼吃了。”我兄弟俩整整哭了一天。当下就跟尚家算了帐，又给别人去作活。我十五岁那年哥指着身底两间房子，找王家借了五百块钱给我娶了个女人，字据上写着我兄弟俩受苦来顶帐。没想到女人过门十来天，国民党匪军三十一师就把哥抓走了。过了两天，王家赶着两挂大车闯进院里来，叫着我的奶名说：“在更！有钱拿钱来，没钱咱就拆房！”我赶紧央求人家：“王掌柜，过两天我受苦给您顶就是了，一年顶不起，二年！”那人说话好气粗：“受苦也不要你呵！你哥在时，哥儿俩还顶不上呢，现在你哥当兵去了，你的话还不是白说！”一边说着一边就叫人动手拆起房子来了。没等我把铺盖全搬出来，房子就倒啦，末了还把院里铺的砖都起上，用车拉走了。从此我和我女人连个住处也没有啦，只好到姑家去借宿。
    哥走了一个多月，队上就给家来了信，说我哥死了。我哭着和叔伯爹爹借了挂车到银家窑子去领尸。那是哥死了的第三天头上，我们从烂房里扒出他的尸首来。他的脸已经黑青黑青了，上身连根毛儿也没挂，下身光穿一条破单裤。我把尸首反过来，就见哥的两条腿烂成血窟窿啦，露出白骨头来，烂肉里面乱营营地爬满了蛆。有个连长出来看见我们，就骂：“你们这地方人真不是玩意儿！不好好干，开他妈的小差！你就跑得了啦？”这时，我才知道哥是因为惦记着那个“穷”家，开小差给队上抓回去打死的！
    国民党还没有害够我家！它在五月抓去我哥，六月把他打死，八月里，又把我抓了去，整整捆了我十四天，吃饭时解开一只胳臂，吃完又捆上。后来把我送到五原，编在补训十七师直属第二连。国民党匪军占领集宁后，我们就搬到那里驻防，白天出操累得两腿上不去炕。冬天睡觉时把棉裤收了，一个个光着屁股盖棉袄。晚上起来解手，嘴里还要喊着一二一，让卫兵听着。就是这样，当兵的还是瞅着空子不断地跑。那班跑了人，班长战士都要挨打，班长四十棍，副班长三十五棍，战士每人二十棍。开小差的本人要是给抓回来，全连每人打他十五棍。在集宁住了九个月，就给他打死了二十来个。三排一个姓李的，也是萨县人，开小差没跑了给抓回去，全连排成队轮番的打，打得他死了用凉水喷过来，架着遛几圈，按在地上再打，他“爹呀！”“娘呀！”的喊叫。我站在队后边混身哆嗦成一团，最后叫到我的名字了，我吓了一跳。拿起棍子来，就想起死去的哥啦。我怎忍心下手呀！把棍子高高举起，轻轻落下，却给连长看出来，他夺过棍子说：“你不会打，我教给你！”说着朝我脊背上啪啪两棍，立刻肿起两条红疙棱。我噙着眼泪说：“学会了，学会了。”接过棍子去打那个弟兄。这时候我才感觉到在国民党军队里当兵的都是受压迫的！我这样过了四年多牛马生活。我在包头二里半村偷着给家里打了封信，我女人回信说：“家里困难，你能回来就回来，不能回来我就另想办法。”这信给连长看见了，押了我七天禁闭，说我要开小差。我把心一狠：“不打信！反正家里死活我也管不了，让她走吧，她还应该活着！”
    我总想一辈子也受不出个头了，没想到年时二月解放军打天镇把我解放。我长了满身疥，解放军送我到涞源石道沟村去休养，在那里住了十几天。房东李元，是个四十多岁的老汉，早起给我们烧水，晚上给我们烧炕。我很奇怪：解放区老百姓怎这么好？老汉跟我说：“我以前是个受苦人，现在打倒了大地主，分了四、五亩地，一头毛驴，翻身啦！再不受压迫了，这全是解放军给的。解放军打仗为的咱，咱帮助解放军是应当的。”
    三月里解放军发给路费让我回家，我找到了一个表姐家，她在天镇城里开肉铺，我就跟他们搭伙贩牲口。八月十八，我们一起六个人赶了二百五十多头羊路过永嘉堡，又被国民党连人带羊都抓去了，又把我补到护路十三团当兵。年时十月解放军攻下花园，我打死排长，拉上三十多个人，带了四挺机枪一门小炮，跑到沙岭子车站投降了解放军。
    到了解放军有个同志问我：“你回家呢，还是参军？”我说：“我没有家了，我要参加解放军。”把我编到咱连里。头天晚上我们到了连部，指导员给我们打洗脸水。吃饭时一个高个子同志给盛饭，第二天点名时，我才知道他是连长！我想起过去刚当兵时，国民党捆了我十四天，那边的连长对我不是打就是骂。到了班里，一排长（大功功臣张本良）和我谈：“过去我也在敌人那边干过，解放一年多，当了排长。在解放军里好好干有出路。”副营长（特等功臣李国英）也找我谈：“早先我也是穷人，小时跟母亲讨吃。现在翻了身，弟兄三个都参加了解放军。我立了特功，政府给家里庆功，母亲也跟着光荣！”后来教导员上课讲：“共产党领导的部队是为受苦人服务的，国民党军队是为大地主的。”我回想起，过去二十年所遇见的事情，确是这样。
    我也是个受苦人呵！在国民党那边挨打受气还给他干了好几年，现在到了自己队伍里为甚不好好干！？我听了别的同志诉苦，我明白了全中国受苦的人不只我一个，有的比我还苦呢，这些苦都是地主和国民党给的。地主就是国民党反动派的根，蒋介石就是大地主头子，不把他们消灭干净，受苦人就别想过好日子。我现在认清了什么叫革命，革命为的谁，我要永远跟着共产党走，我的前进目标就是解放全中国受苦受难的老百姓，为我死去的爹娘哥哥报仇！（附图片）
