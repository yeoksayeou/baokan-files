　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 18th: Moscow dispatch: The international affairs commentator for the Soviet Red Star newspaper recently published a commentary on the joint communique issued by the US, UK, and French foreign ministers on April 8 regarding the German question, stating: The three occupation zones of West Germany will be transformed into the Federal Republic of West Germany, establishing a "government" under the joint control of US, UK, and French "High Commissioners." The communique stipulates that the future West German "government" will retain the "right to exercise the German people's movement towards autonomous government," but all its administrative and legislative powers will be invalid "without the approval of the Allied authorities." Simultaneously with the publication of the communique, the three governments also announced the "Occupation Statute," which reserves for the Western countries' representatives comprehensive control over West Germany's entire economic and political life, including domestic and foreign policies, foreign trade, finance, scientific research, etc. The commentator stated that the flexible wording of the "Occupation Statute" actually grants the "High Commissioners" the right to interfere in all matters of West Germany. Therefore, the "autonomous" West German state is merely a puppet in the hands of the Western countries. Of course, the US "High Commissioner" will play the leading role. The commentator emphasized that the "Washington deal" is part of the divisive policy pursued by the US-UK bloc on the German issue, aimed at completely overturning the Potsdam Agreement. They intend to complete the division of Germany by establishing a pseudo-West German state based on German reactionary forces. German democratic newspapers unanimously declared that the "Occupation Statute" makes any democratic development in West Germany impossible. Under the system of this "Statute," the West German state will become a colony of US-UK monopoly capital. The commentator pointed out that hundreds of millions of people in Europe and around the world justly assess the US-UK-France agreement as a new and serious threat to the security of the European people, attempting to turn West Germany into a fortress for German militarists and revanchists, and a strategic springboard for US-UK imperialist aggression against Eastern European countries.

　　红星报评论美英法协定
  　美帝妄图变西德为殖民地
    严重威胁了欧洲人民安全
    【新华社北平十八日电】莫斯科讯：苏联红星报国际问题评论员顷就美英法外长四月八日关于德国问题所发表的联合公报著评称：西德三个占领区将改变为西德联邦共和国，设立一个在美、英、法“高级专员”联合管制下的“政府”。公报中确定未来西德“政府”保有为“行使德国人民走向自治政府的权利”，但是，所有其行政和立法权，如“未得盟国当局的批准”，即告无效。与发表公报同时，三国政府又公布，“占领法规”，该“法规”保留了西方国家代表对西德的整个经济和政治生活的全面控制权，包括内外政策、对外贸易、财政金融、科学研究等等方面。评论员称，“占领法规”中富有弹性的措词，实际上给予“高级专员”以干涉西德一切问题的权利。因此，“自治的”西德国家只是西方国家手中的傀儡而已。当然，美国的“高级专员”将扮演主要的角色。评论员强调称，“华盛顿交易”是美英集团在德国问题上所奉行的旨在彻底推翻波茨坦决议的分裂政策的一环。他们打算经由建立以德国反动势力为基础的伪西德国家来完成德国的分裂。德国民主报纸一致宣称，“占领法规”使西德的民主发展没有任何可能，在该“法规”的体制下，西德国家将变成美英垄断资本的殖民地。评论员指出，欧洲和全世界千百万人民，公正地评价美英法三国的协定是对欧洲人民安全的新的严重威胁，企图把西德变成德国军国主义者和复仇主义者的堡垒，变成美英对东欧国家进行帝国主义侵略的战略跳板。
