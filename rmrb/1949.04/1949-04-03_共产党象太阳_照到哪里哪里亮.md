　  The Communist Party is Like the Sun
    Shining Brightly Wherever It Goes
    Editor:
    After reading Ms. Huang Piao's letter published in the newspaper on March 29th, my heart! It was about to break. Since then, I have also recalled my unfortunate experiences.
    I got married at the age of fifteen. My husband made a living by pulling a rickshaw, my mother-in-law did laundry and sewing for others, and I went to work as a worker in a tobacco company. The money I earned every day was not enough to support myself, and the money earned by the three of us together could not even maintain the minimum living expenses.
    I lost my job at the age of nineteen. Why did I lose my job? It was because I couldn't bear the inhuman life of a beast of burden in the factory. The factory director and capitalists could insult and scold me at will, even beat me...
    After returning home, there was no way to make a living. My husband pulled a rickshaw, but it was not enough to support the family. Every day he returned home without a smile because he was underfed and had nothing to drink. What could I do? Was my fate really so bitter?
    The Communist Party is like the sun, shining brightly wherever it goes. ...The ancient city of Beiping has also been illuminated by the Communist Party, and my broken heart feels infinite warmth. Recently, I have seen many articles in the newspaper about women seeking liberation. In addition to the clear path you pointed out for Ms. Huang, what is more important is the National Women's Congress held in Beiping, and our beloved Communist Party Chairman Mao also came. He will think of ways for us oppressed women. We demand liberation, but how to seek it, and how to achieve economic independence and political equality? Which department will lead us? How will it lead us on the road to liberation? This is my urgent hope. I hope you will give me a clear path soon!

### 共产党象太阳　照到哪里哪里亮

　  共产党象太阳
    照到哪里哪里亮
    编辑先生：
    三月二十九日报上，发表了黄飘女士的一封信，看后，我的心啊！简直都要破碎了，自此，我也忆起我不幸的遭遇。
    十五岁我即出嫁了，丈夫靠拉三轮车糊口，婆母给别人洗衣缝纫，我就进入了一家烟草公司当工人，每天所得的钱，不够养活自己，一家三口合挣的钱，还不能维持最低的生活费用。
    我于十九岁那年即失业了，为什么失业呢？是因我在工厂，实在不能忍受那种非人的牛马生活，厂长资本家可以任意的侮辱漫骂，甚至打。……
    回家后生活没办法，丈夫拉三轮，顾不住生活，他每天回得家，因少吃没喝的，没有个笑脸，我有什么办法呢？我的命运就是这样的苦吗？
    共产党象太阳，照到哪里哪里亮。…北平这座古城，也被共产党照亮了，我这颗破碎的心，也感到无限的温暖。近日见到报纸上发表了很多关于妇女求解放的事情。除去你们给黄女士指的明路外，更重要的是在北平召开的全国妇女代表大会，还有亲爱的共产党毛主席也来了，对我们这些受压迫的妇女是会想办法的。我们要求解放，但如何求法，怎样才能达到经济上独立政治上平等呢？那个部门领导我们呢？怎样领导我们走上解放的大道？这是我的迫切希望。盼你们赶快给以明路！
