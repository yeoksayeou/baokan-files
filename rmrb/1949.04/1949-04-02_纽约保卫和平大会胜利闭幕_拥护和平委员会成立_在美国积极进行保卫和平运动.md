Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, March 31st: TASS, New York dispatch: The Cultural and Scientific Conference for World Peace concluded on the 27th. This conference, convened by the National Committee of American Scientists, Artists, and Professionals, lasted for three days and passed a resolution calling for a struggle against fascism and to prevent new wars. The conference produced a Committee to Uphold Peace from Cultural and Scientific Circles, responsible for notifying the American people, the American government, and the United Nations Organization of the conference's resolutions, and for organizing an active movement to defend peace in the United States.

Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, April 1st: TASS, New York dispatch: The Committee to Uphold Peace from Cultural and Scientific Circles, elected by the New York Peace Conference, informed reporters that the conference had concluded victoriously. It demonstrated the will of the American people to keep the channels of communication between the United States and all countries of the world open. It also indicated that all differences should be resolved through peaceful negotiations.

As a first step in implementing the conference's resolutions on promoting the peace movement in the United States, the Committee to Uphold Peace announced the launch of a "Peace Signature Campaign," using the form of a petition, inviting millions of Americans to sign it. This petition will be submitted to Truman on May 30th, "National Day," the American holiday commemorating fallen soldiers from all wars since the Civil War. Progressive intellectuals in major cities have begun preparing a series of local "Cultural and Scientific Circles Upholding Peace Conferences" to disseminate the conference's declarations to the wider American populace. According to the National Committee of Artists, Scientists, and Professionals, an incomplete schedule of such meetings being convened by local committees to uphold peace already includes New York, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Detroit, St. Louis, and Los Angeles. Many other cities are also making preparations.
