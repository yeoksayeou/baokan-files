    Dongdan Parade Ground – this was the place where American imperialists humiliated Chinese female students, where the Kuomintang squandered the labor of thousands of people, demolished dozens of civilian houses and shops, and built an airfield in preparation for escape. Less than a month after liberation, a new People's Bazaar emerged here. This market includes 1,500 stalls and shops of all sizes. In terms of industry, there are four major categories: woodwork, used clothing, food and miscellaneous items. There are more than 30 woodwork businesses, more than 260 used clothing businesses, more than 200 food businesses, and more than 1,000 miscellaneous items. The goods of these vendors are mainly collected from small markets and peddlers in Beiping or from households; they are usually sold at prices slightly lower than the market price. Most of the people who buy things here are middle and lower-level civil servants, businessmen, and students. Their purchasing power is generally not high, and they can make do for a while by saving a few dollars and buying one or two pieces of used goods.

    Now their business is generally good. A small restaurant with only three people can earn more than 2,000 yuan a day, and at least 400 yuan. A cloth seller said, "I can always earn more than 200 yuan a day." The slowest business is selling Western suits. A man who has been in the Western suit business for four years said: "I haven't earned a penny in three days. Foreign goods are not popular these days. I plan to change the stored Western suits into uniforms to make a living."

    Most of these stall vendors and shops were originally located in Qianbu Corridor in front of Tiananmen Square. However, under the rule of the Kuomintang, they were driven out by the Kuomintang reactionary military police in the middle of the night in the winter of the 36th year of the Republic because they "affected the appearance and hindered the scenic area." At that time, they had to worry about the Kuomintang military police and secret agents torturing them all day long: yesterday, Uncle Zhang ate rice cakes here and nodded and left; today, Mr. Li came to eat fried tripe and said, "Charge it to my account," never to be seen again. After liberation, they moved from Dongdan, Wangfujing, and near the Pingjin Railway Bureau to the flat ground of Dongdan Parade Ground and established the "Dongdan People's Bazaar." Now they have automatically organized themselves and elected 14 representatives. The Seventh District People's Government often talks to them, absorbs their opinions, and begins to establish order in the bazaar. At present, the weather is getting hotter, the bazaar has many reed mats and wooden boards, and it is too far from the water source, which may cause fires that are difficult to extinguish. The People's Government once issued instructions to dismantle the reed mats; but after the vendors discussed the matter, they believed that if the reed mats were removed, it would be difficult to do a lot of business, such as food shops being afraid of sand getting into the food, and used clothing sellers being afraid of the clothes fading. This opinion was accepted by the People's Government, and it was announced that the sheds could not be dismantled. However, all vendors should be mobilized to pay attention to fire prevention. Now the vendors are paying attention to implementing this. Recently, they have also been discussing with the People's Government to determine the boundaries of the land and have put forward specific measures. The Public Security Bureau of the People's Government has also discussed this. Their representatives said: "We can freely express our opinions today. This is the first time in our lives. From now on, we must assist the People's Government to maintain revolutionary order."

　　东单人民商场
    陈迹
    东单练兵场，这个美帝国主义污辱了中国的女学生，国民党耗费了千百人民的劳力，拆毁了数十栋民房店铺，筑成准备逃跑的飞机场的地方，在解放后不到一个月的功夫，出现了一个新的人民市场。这个市场包括一千五百个大大小小的摊贩小铺。以行业来说，有木器、估衣、饮食和杂项四大类，木器业有三十多家，估衣有二百六十多家，饮食类有二百多家，其余一千多家都是杂项。这些摊贩的货物，主要是从北平各小市和打鼓小担上或住户中收集起来的；通常是以较市场略低的价钱卖出。在这里买东西的人，多是一些中下级公务员、生意人和学生。他们的购买力一般都不高，为了节省几个钱，买上一两件旧货，也能凑合用些时候。
    现在他们的生意，一般都不错。一个只有三个人的小吃店，每天可收入两千多元，至少可赚到四百多元。有个卖布的说：“咱每天总可以赚上二百多元。”生意最清淡的，要算是卖西服了。有个干了四年西服生意的说：“咱三天没收进一文钱，这年头不兴外国货罗。咱准备把存的西服改成制服，才有办法。”
    这些摊贩小铺中，大部分的饮食店原设在天安门前的千步廊。但是在国民党统治下，因为他们“有碍观瞻，妨害风景区”，被国民党反动军警在三十六年冬天半夜里赶了出去。那时候，他们整天要担心国民党的军警特务来折磨：昨天张二爷在这儿吃了年糕，点点头就走；今天李先生又来吃爆肚，说声记帐，永不见面。解放后，他们即从东单、王府井、平津铁路局的附近，都迁到了东单练兵场的平地上，成立了“东单人民商场”。现在他们已自动的组织起来，选举了代表十四人。第七区人民政府常常和他们谈话，吸取他们的意见，开始树立该商场的秩序。目前天气渐热，商场多席篷木板，且距水源太远，恐生火患，难于扑灭。人民政府曾一度发出拆席篷的指示；但经摊贩们商量结果，认为把席篷拆了，有好多买卖不好做，如饮食店怕沙土弄到饭菜中去，卖估衣的怕晒得衣服褪色。这个意见，经人民政府接受了，宣布可以不拆篷。不过应该要发动全体摊贩注意消防工作。现在摊贩们也正注意实行。最近他们又在向人民政府商议确定地界的问题，并提出具体的办法，人民政府公安局亦曾为此讨论。他们的代表说：“咱们今天可以自由提意见了，这是咱们生下来第一次的事。今后，咱们一定得协助人民政府，维持革命的秩序。”
