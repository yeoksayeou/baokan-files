    [Hebei Central News] Since February, influenza had been found in An'guo City. By March, it had spread rapidly, and 220 people in the city's government offices, schools, and shops fell ill within seven days. The government immediately issued an emergency notice to all departments, strictly implementing patient isolation, and organized doctors to treat the outbreak. It was completely eradicated within three days.

　　(Zhang Shuoming)
    [Additional News] Four kinds of epidemics have recently been discovered in Lixian County. The first is similar to meningitis: in the initial stage, it seems like a cold, with chills, slight headache or abdominal pain. After one day, the chest feels congested, with vomiting and loss of appetite. The hands are cold past the elbows, and the feet are cold past the knees, with heavy sweating. The mind is clear, but the pulse is tight and thin. It is an acute infectious disease, and death usually occurs within two or three days. This disease has been found in two villages, Nanwufu and Ligang. Nanwufu discovered this disease last year, and more than 20 people died. This spring, another seven people have died. Cases occur every ten or fifteen days (the mortality rate is over 90%). It is estimated that the incubation period of this germ may be ten to fifteen days. The second is measles: this disease has been discovered in a total of six villages in the county. The third is smallpox and chickenpox: seven villages in the first district and one village in the fifth district, a total of eight villages, have discovered this disease. No less than fifty or sixty people in each village are suffering from this disease. In Zhangcunying Village in the first district alone, six people have died. The fourth is epidemic influenza, which is prevalent throughout the county. The county government has organized doctors to rush to various places for rescue. Most patients have now recovered.

 　　安国时疫　三天扑灭
    【冀中讯】安国市自二月起即发现流行性感冒，至三月蔓延转剧，全市机关、学校、商店七天内即病二百二十人。政府当即紧急通知各部门，严格实行病人隔离，并组织医生突击治疗，三天中已完全扑灭。　
　　（张朔明）
    【又讯】蠡县在最近发现有四种流行病。第一种，类似脑膜炎：在初期好象感冒，发冷，头微痛或腹疼，过一天即胸膈不通气，呕吐，不思饮食，手凉过肘，足凉过膝，大汗如雨，心中明白，脉搏紧细，是一种急性传染病，一般的二、三日即死。发现这种病的有两个村，即南五夫和李岗村。南五夫去年即发现此病，死了二十多人，今春又死了七人。都是每隔十日或十五日病一个或两个人（死亡率占百分之九十以上），估计这种病菌的潜伏期可能是十天至十五天。第二种是麻疹：全县共六个村发现了此病。第三种是天花、水痘：一区有七个村，五区有一个村共八个村发现了此病。每村患此病者不下五六十人，仅一区张村营一村即死了六个人。第四种是流行性的感冒，普遍全县。县府已组织医生，分赴各地抢救。现大部病人已痊愈。
