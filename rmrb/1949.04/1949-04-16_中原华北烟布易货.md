　　Central Plains and North China Tobacco and Cloth Barter
    [Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 12th] The trade corporations of the Central Plains and North China liberated areas are conducting large-scale transactions. According to the contract signed by both parties on February 15th, the Central Plains Trade Corporation will sell 2 million jin of tobacco leaves and 1 million jin of cotton to the North China Trade Corporation. The latter will sell 44,000 bundles of 20-count fine yarn, 1,000 barrels of gasoline (equivalent to 340,000 jin), and 27,300 bolts of Five Blessings and Sunshine white cloth to the former. These goods will be shipped from March 15th and are expected to be completed by mid-April. When the famous Xuchang tobacco leaves arrived in Peiping and Tianjin, various cigarette merchants rushed to purchase them. Now, the North China Trade Corporation has proposed to the Central Plains Trade Corporation to continue purchasing 4 million jin. The Industry and Commerce Department of the Northeast Administrative Committee has also requested to purchase 5 million to 8 million jin. In addition, North China needs to obtain 6 million to 10 million jin of cotton from the Central Plains to supply factories in Tianjin and other places. In the future, the sales of Central Plains' special products, cotton and tobacco leaves, will become increasingly smooth.
