Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 15th: TASS, Berlin dispatch: The German People's Council issued an appeal on April 12th, calling on the German people to elect representatives to attend the Third All-German People's Congress to be held in Berlin on May 15th and 16th, which will discuss issues of national importance. The appeal was signed by Wilhelm Pieck, Nuschke, and Kastner, the Presidium of the German People's Council. The communique stated: The Bonn Parliamentary Council and the Economic Council of the Western Allied occupation zones of Germany have refused to hold a joint meeting in Braunschweig with the delegation elected at the Sixth Session of the German People's Council, which is deeply regretted by all those who cherish the welfare of the German people. The proposal of the German People's Council has received the profound sympathy of the entire German people, who had placed great hope in the Braunschweig joint meeting. The German people are in an extremely critical situation due to the measures taken by the Western occupation powers. Due to the provisions of the colonial "Occupation Statute," the final dismemberment of Germany is nearing completion. The measures taken by the Western occupying authorities pose a major danger to the lives and future of the German people, prompting the People's Council to call on all freedom-loving democratic forces in the German people to strengthen resistance to the policies of dismembering Germany and causing disaster to Germany, and to discuss with the German People's Council issues related to the survival, unification, peace treaty, and democratic economic recovery of our nation. These tasks will be resolved by the Third All-German People's Congress. The representatives attending the congress will be elected by the German people through universal secret ballot. The communique calls on all political parties, organizations, and progressives in East and West Germany to send representatives to the congress.

　　德国人民委员会号召
  　全德选举代表出席柏林会议
    【新华社北平十五日电】塔斯社柏林讯：德国人民委员会于四月十二日发出呼吁，号召全德人民选举代表，出席将于五月十五、十六两日在柏林举行的第三届全德人民代表大会，该会将讨论具有全国重要性的问题。呼吁文告由德国人民委员会主席团主席皮克、努舍克及卡斯纳签字。该文告称：波恩议会委员会及西德联占区经济委员会，已经拒绝与德国人民委员会第六次会议上选出的代表团在布伦瑞克举行联席会议，一切珍爱德国人民福利的人，对于此事都深感遗憾。德国人民委员会的建议，已得到全体德国人民的深刻同情，他们曾对布伦瑞克联席会议寄以很大的希望。德国人民因为西德占领国家所采取的措施已处于极端危急的地位。由于殖民的“占领法规”的规定，德国的最后肢解正抵于完成。西方占领当局的措施，对德国人民的生活和未来的重大危险，促使人民委员会号召德国人民中一切爱好自由的民主的力量，加强抵抗肢解德国、使德国招致灾祸的政策，号召他们与德国人民委员会共同讨论有关我们民族的生存、统一、和约与民主的经济恢复的问题。这些任务将由第三届全德人民代表大会加以解决。出席大会的代表将由德国人民以普遍秘密投票的方式选出。文告号召东德、西德的一切政党、团体和进步人士派遣代表出席大会。
