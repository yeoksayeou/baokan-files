  　Protest the French Government's Reactionary Measures
    [This Newspaper's Report] Over 850 professors, lecturers, and teaching assistants from universities in Peiping signed a protest against the French government's restrictions on the number of representatives from various countries attending the World Congress of Supporters of Peace. The protest stated: "The French government has actually adopted extremely reactionary measures, limiting the number of representatives from various countries sent to Paris to attend the World Congress of Supporters of Peace to no more than eight. We express our utmost indignation and lodge a serious protest with the French government."
    The French people support peace, and the people of the world all support peace. The French government, taking its cue from the American imperialist warmongers, vainly attempts to suppress the will of the French people and the people of the world to support peace. It will surely be spurned by the French people and opposed by the people of the world.
    We ask the French government to show some reason and immediately allow all representatives from various countries attending the World Congress of Supporters of Peace to freely arrive in Paris, to work to eliminate the threat of war, and to work to safeguard world peace.
    In the struggle to defend peace, the people of all countries have already achieved great gains. They will continue to achieve even more brilliant successes. Those warmongers, no matter how cunning, will eventually be eliminated by the forces of peace!
    [Beiping Xinhua Broadcasting Station, 20th dispatch] The World Congress of Supporters of Peace opened in Paris today. Xiao Caiyu and Long Yin, professors at Nankai University in Tianjin, and Chen Jinmin, Dean of the School of Science at Peiyang University, and Professor Zhang Guofan, expressed their indignation at the French reactionary government's measures to restrict the entry of delegations attending the World Congress of Supporters of Peace. Professor Xiao Caiyu said: "This congress is a grand gathering of representatives of peace-loving people from all over the world. No means can weaken the power of peace-loving forces in the world." Professor Zhang Guofan said: "The warmongers have shown dismay at the growth and expansion of the world's peace forces."

  　抗议法政府反动措施
    【本报讯】平市各大学教授讲师助教八百五十余人，签名抗议法国政府限制各国参加世界拥护和平大会代表名额。抗议书说：法国政府居然采取极端反动的措施，限制各国人民派往巴黎参加世界拥护和平大会的代表人数、不准超过八名。我们除了极其愤慨之外，特向法国政府提出严重的抗议。
    法国人民是拥护和平的，全世界的人民也都是拥护和平的。法国政府仰承美国帝国主义战争挑拨者的鼻息，妄想压制法国人民和全世界人民拥护和平的意志，一定会遭受法国人民的唾弃，遭受全世界人民的反对。
    我们请法国政府拿出一点理性来，立即准许各国参加拥护世界和平大会的代表们全部自由地到达巴黎，为消灭战争的威胁而努力，为保障世界和平而努力。
    在保卫和平的斗争中，各国人民已经得到很大的收获。他们将继续获得更辉煌的成就，那些战争贩子，无论是怎样地诡计多端，终于会被爱好和平的力量所消灭！
    【北平新华广播电台二十日消息】世界拥护和平大会今天在巴黎召开，天津南开大学教授萧采瑜、龙吟和北洋大学理学院院长陈荩民、教授张国藩等对法国反动政府限制出席拥护和平大会代表团入境的措施，都表示愤慨。萧采瑜教授说：“这次大会是世界爱好和平的人民代表的大集会，任何手段也不可能削弱世界爱好和平的力量。”张国藩教授说：“战争挑拨者对世界和平力量的增长扩大，已表现了懊丧。”
