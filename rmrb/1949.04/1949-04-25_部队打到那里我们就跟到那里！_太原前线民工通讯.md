　　We will follow the troops wherever they fight!
    ——Frontline Migrant Worker Communication from Taiyuan——
    When the artillery fire for our army's final assault on Taiyuan sounded at midnight on the 19th of this month, the entire line of migrant worker stretcher teams shouted the glorious slogan "We will follow the troops wherever they fight!" Indeed, as the rapidly advancing People's Liberation Army approached the suburbs of Taiyuan, the migrant workers surged forward like a tide, fully demonstrating the people's high degree of political awareness in relying on themselves. When the solid first line of defense of the Yan [Xishan] bandits was broken through by our army and advanced into the enemy's depth, the migrant workers from Wuqi County, Hebei Province, carried ammunition boxes and rolled forward through the artillery fire, continuously supplying the soldiers with grenades. They said with excitement: "The soldiers are shedding blood and fighting for us, our task is to ensure the soldiers have enough ammunition, and the chance to earn merit and win the red flag is now!" They closely followed the Liberation Army in occupying enemy positions, picking up enemy ammunition and handing it over to our own soldiers. They cherished the wounded, not only showing on-the-spot rescue and rapid transfer to the rear, but also caring for the wounded as if they were their own flesh and blood. Migrant workers from Suning County rescued the wounded in a hail of bullets. When the trenches were narrow and could not be turned, everyone carried the wounded on their backs to the dressing station. Communist Party member Sun Hongqi, already over fifty, was brave and active, not falling behind the young people. His stretcher was always closely following the troops, and he made eight round trips in one night, rescuing and transferring the wounded. Zhu Fangzhou, the political officer for the migrant workers in the county and a Communist Party member, was injured by enemy shrapnel. When others tried to bandage him, he firmly refused, fearing that it would hinder the migrant workers from following the army, saying: "My injury is not serious!" (Chen Keng)

　　部队打到那里我们就跟到那里！
    ——太原前线民工通讯——
    当本月十九日午夜，我军最后攻击太原的炮声一响，全线民工担架队便齐声喊出“部队打到那里，我们就跟到那里”的光荣口号。的确，当神速的人民解放军逼进太原城郊时，民工们也如潮水似的涌向前去，充分表现了人民依靠自己的高度政治觉悟，又当阎匪坚固的第一道防线被我军突破而向敌纵深进展时，河北无极县的民工们便抱着弹药箱从炮火中滚滚前进，源源地供应了战士的手榴弹，他们激昂地说：“战士为咱们流血拼命，我们的任务就是保证战士足够的弹药，立功夺红旗就在这会儿！他们紧跟着解放军在占领敌人的阵地上，拣起敌人的弹药交给自己的战士。他们爱护伤员，不仅表现火线上的抢救与迅速转运后方，而且对伤员的关怀尤如骨肉之亲。肃宁县的民工，在枪林弹雨中抢救伤员，交通沟窄不能转弯，大家就背起伤员向包扎所赶送。共产党员孙宏琪已过五十，但其勇敢积极不落后于青年人，他的担架随时都在紧跟着部队，一夜中往返八次抢救转运伤员，该县民工政治干事朱方舟是共产党员，被敌弹片炸伤，别人替他包扎，他恐妨碍民工随军前进，便坚决拒绝说：“我的伤不要紧！”（陈铿）
