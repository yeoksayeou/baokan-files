　　Newly Liberated Soldiers Capture Prisoners
　　(I) On March 1st, while the Second Company of the First Battalion of a certain unit of the Northwest People's Liberation Army was pursuing the Hu Zongnan bandit army's 20th Division, Li Jinshan, a soldier who had been liberated less than nine days earlier, spotted Ma Helian, the deputy commander of the 58th Regiment of the Hu bandits, running ahead. He immediately rushed forward and shouted, "Deputy Commander, stop!" The bandit army deputy commander looked back and, thinking he was one of his men, stopped and asked, "Which company are you from?" Li Jinshan shouted, "I used to be a soldier in the 4th Company, 2nd Battalion of your regiment. I was liberated in the Tongchuan battle on February 20th. Now, why don't you quickly lay down your weapon?" The bandit deputy commander, hearing this, took off running. Li Jinshan tightly held his gun and chased after him, shouting, "As long as you lay down your weapons, the People's Liberation Army will treat prisoners leniently." The bandit deputy commander, with nowhere to run, finally became Li Jinshan's prisoner.
　　(II) Another soldier of a certain unit, Xia Yunjie, who had also been liberated not long ago, shouted while pursuing the Hu bandit's 20th Division, "Don't sell your lives for Hu Zongnan! The People's Liberation Army treats prisoners leniently. I used to be in the 1st Company of the 97th Regiment of the 20th Division. I was liberated in Tongchuan a few days ago." He confiscated two enemy guns along the way. As he continued to pursue, he suddenly saw an enemy with a handgun running away in a panic. Xia Yunjie knew this must be a bandit army "officer," and immediately rushed forward, shouting, "Stop right now! I'll shoot you if you don't stop!" The bandit army "officer" looked back and, knowing he couldn't escape, quickly stopped. Xia Yunjie stepped forward with his gun. He looked and realized it was his former company commander when he was a soldier in Hu Zongnan's bandit army. Xia Yunjie pointed his gun at him and said humorously, "Company commander, I'm sorry, hand over your gun to me." That bandit army company commander thus became a prisoner of his former soldier.

　　新解放战士捉俘虏
    （一）三月一日西北解放军某部一大队二连在追击胡宗南匪部二十师时，刚被解放过来不到九天的战士李金山一眼看见胡匪五十八团的副团长马合连在前面逃跑，就立即冲上去，大喊：“副团长站住！”匪军副团长回头一看，以为他是部下的人，站住问：“你是那一连的？”李金山大声说：“我过去就在你团二营四连当兵，二月二十日在铜川战役中被解放的。现在你还不快放下武器？”匪副团长一听，撒腿就跑。李金山紧紧持枪追赶，并大声说：“只要放下武器，解放军宽待俘虏。”匪副团长走头无路，终于作了李金山的俘虏。
    （二）某部另一个也是刚被解放不久的战士夏云杰在追击胡匪二十师时，一边走一边喊：“不要给胡宗南卖命呀！解放军宽待俘虏。我就是二十师九十七团一连的，前几天才在铜川被解放的。”他一路上缴了两个敌人的枪。当他继续往前追时，忽然瞧见一个带着手枪的敌人正在仓惶逃跑。夏云杰知道这定是匪军的“官长”，立时赶上前去，大声吼道：“马上站住！不站住就打死你！”那个匪军“官长”回头一望，知已无法脱逃，赶紧站住。夏云杰持枪上前，一看，原来就是自己过去在胡宗南匪军中当兵时的连长。夏云杰把枪口对着他，幽默地说：“连长，对你不起，把你的手枪缴给我。”那个匪军连长就这样做了他旧日的士兵的俘虏。
