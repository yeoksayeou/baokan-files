[Taihang Telegraph] After the recovery of Hui County town in northern Henan on February 4th, many returning and fleeing landlords launched counterattacks against the peasants, and some remnant bandits and special agents plotted to lie low and sabotage. Hu Xingtang, a landlord from Beiguan in the Fourth District, went to the house that had been allocated to a farmer and angrily demanded that the owner vacate the house for him. When the owner reasoned with him, he kicked over the owner's stove, putting on a frightening and ugly display. Fleeing landlords also used threats and inducements in an attempt to achieve their conspiracy to counterattack the peasants. Shao Liren, a landlord from Taiping Village in the First District, even openly wrote to the head of the First District, "begging" him to stop the masses from planting "his land" again. At the same time, remnant bandits and special agents continued to carry out lurking activities. Fan Zhenrong, a former security captain for the enemy, returned to Tianzhuang and has already usurped the important position of militia captain in the village. Similar situations have occurred in areas such as the Sixth District. Although the leadership of the county has begun to pay attention to the above-mentioned situations, they still show麻痹 paralysis and allow them to develop. Therefore, the broad masses are very dissatisfied, and a few people even show signs of surrender and are even subjected to humiliation. After the return of a fugitive landlord surnamed Lang in Xigeng Village, Seventh District, he was still fed by his neighbors in turn for fifteen days without working. Many villages even sent large carts to help fugitive landlords transport things and send people back and forth. This right-leaning tendency in the county has directly affected the work of eliminating bandits. In villages such as Mazhuang in the Sixth District, remnant bandits have been found shooting at the militia from the shadows. The leadership of Hui County should conduct a profound self-examination from top to bottom, quickly correct this mistake, and handle the counterattacks by fleeing landlords in accordance with the law.

　　返乡地主竟敢反攻　残余匪特犹图活动
  　辉县急应检查处理
    【太行电】豫北辉县城于二月四日收复后，不少返乡逃亡地主向农民反攻，一些残匪分子阴谋潜伏破坏。四区北关地主胡兴堂走到早已分配给农民的房子里，气汹汹的叫房主给他腾房子。房主和他讲理，他竟一脚把房主的灶台踢倒，装出个吓人的丑样子。逃亡地主并用威胁利诱手段，妄图达到向农民反攻的阴谋。一区太平庄地主邵利仁竟公然上书一区区长，“恳请”制止群众再种“他的地”。与此同时，残匪分子仍进行潜伏活动。敌保安分队长范振荣返回田庄后，已窃取该村自卫队长要职，在六区等地也有此种情事发生。对上述情事，该县领导上虽已开始注意，但仍表现麻痹，任其发展。故广大群众很不满意，少数群众则表示退让，甚至受其凌辱。七区西耿村郎姓逃亡地主返乡后十五天，仍由其邻居轮流管饭而不事劳动。不少村里竟派大车给逃亡地主往返拉东西、送人。该县此种右倾偏向，使肃匪工作受到直接影响，六区马庄等村已发现残匪向民兵打黑枪。辉县领导上应自上而下深刻检查，迅速纠正这种错误，对于逃亡地主反攻等情事应分别予以法办。
