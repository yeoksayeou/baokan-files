Zhengding Women's Federation Rectifies Organization Through Production

[This newspaper's report] The Zhengding Municipal Women's Federation has organized women through production, changing their attitude from indifference to cordiality. In mid-March, the private Rui Fu Cheng Clothing Bureau contracted women to make 4,000 mosquito nets, originally setting the price at 3.5 jin of millet per large net and 2.10 jin per small net. However, the bureau only paid 1.5 jin of millet per net, unreasonably lowering wages. The Municipal Women's Federation and the Municipal Trade Union Association then cooperated with the government to negotiate with the factory, increasing the wage millet. In early April, they also took the initiative to contact the North China Military Region Clothing Factory, mobilizing women from various streets to make machine gun scarves and select military uniforms, solving the living difficulties of some poor working women. During these various tasks, the Municipal Women's Federation paid attention to discovering activists and reforming the organization. The director of the Southwest Street Women's Federation was irresponsible, and all the women immediately held a re-election. Because the work of the Women's Federation was integrated with women's production, the women's attitude towards the Women's Federation cadres also became more cordial.

　　正定妇联通过生产
  　整顿组织
    【本报讯】正定市妇联从生产中组织妇女，使妇女对妇联会的态度由冷淡转向亲切。三月中，私营瑞蚨成衣局，包给妇女蚊帐四千床，原定大的每床三斤半小米，小的二斤十两，但该局每床只发斤半小米，无理压低了工资。市妇联、市职工会便协同政府向工厂交涉，增加了工资米。四月初又主动与华北军区被服厂联系，动员各街妇女作机枪围脖与挑选军衣，解决了一部贫苦劳动妇女生活困难。市妇联在此各项工作中注意发现积极分子，改造组织。西南街的妇联主任不负责任，全体妇女立即进行了改选。由于妇联工作与妇女生产结合，妇女们对妇联干部的态度也亲热起来。
