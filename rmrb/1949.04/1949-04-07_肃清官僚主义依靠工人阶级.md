Rely on the Working Class to Eliminate Bureaucracy

In the public-owned factories in the liberated areas, workers' representatives generally participate in the factory management committee, and solicit workers' opinions through various means, so that factory management gradually becomes democratic, thereby giving play to the enthusiasm of the working masses and achieving the goal of developing production. However, there are still a small number of cadres who retain the old ruling class viewpoints, disregard workers' opinions, and regard the trade union as an optional decoration, with serious bureaucratic work styles. The few leading cadres of the Daxing Cotton Mill in Shijiazhuang, reported today, are among them.

Comrades with this kind of bureaucratic work style cannot see the wisdom of the masses, nor can they see the power of the masses. On the one hand, they demand that workers increase production, but on the other hand, they are seriously divorced from the working masses, do not give workers the democracy they deserve, and do not resolutely rely on the working class. Their mistakes are prominently manifested in the following aspects: First, they disregard workers' criticisms and suggestions of the leadership; even if the opinions are correct, they delay implementation or ignore them, and even take suppressive or disguised suppressive measures; second, they do not care about workers' lives, and even treat workers with the attitude of capitalists, such as saying "there are plenty of workers"; third, they disconnect systems, discipline, and production plans from the enthusiasm of workers, belittle trade union work, want to use administrative power to solve all problems, are unwilling to let workers participate in factory management, and even adopt crude punishment.

These comrades do not understand that only by thoroughly relying on the working class can factories be well-run and production be developed. It is necessary for the leadership to have a production plan and stipulate various systems and labor disciplines; but there is a prerequisite that must be resolved, which is to mobilize the enthusiasm and creativity of the workers. Everything we set, if not combined with this basic condition, is definitely impossible to do well. Our plans and systems themselves, if they do not absorb the opinions of the workers, are also impossible to be truly reasonable and perfect.

Therefore, we need to humbly listen to workers' criticisms and suggestions to us. If they are correct, we must immediately accept and implement them. The same is true for workers' living requirements. As long as these requirements are legitimate and possible to achieve, they should be done quickly; if it is impossible to do so, we should also explain patiently, and we cannot take a cold or indifferent attitude, let alone attack, suppress, or punish. We must care about the lives and difficulties of the workers at all times, just like caring about our own flesh and blood. Taking an indifferent attitude towards this is a mistake in principle.

Of course, overcoming bureaucracy and relying on the working class does not mean that we should not educate and lead the workers. On the contrary, the vanguard of the proletariat—the Communist Party—must lead workers to study at all times and strengthen the education of workers to improve their political level and class consciousness. Only in this way can workers truly become the leading class, become the true masters of the factory, and truly implement the democratization of factory management to achieve the goal of restoring and developing production.

### 肃清官僚主义依靠工人阶级

    肃清官僚主义  依靠工人阶级
    解放区的公营工厂中，一般都有工人的代表参加工厂管理委员会，并通过各种方式，征求工人意见，使工厂管理逐渐走向民主化，从而发挥了工人群众的积极性，达到发展生产的目的。但是，仍有少部分干部，残留有旧的统治阶级观点，漠视工人意见，将工会看成一种可有可无的装饰品，存在着严重的官僚主义作风。今天报载石市大兴纱厂的少数领导干部，便是其中之一。
    存在这种官僚主义作风的同志，看不见群众的智慧，看不见群众的力量。他们一方面要求工人增加生产，但却严重的脱离工人群众，不给工人以应有的民主，不坚决依靠工人阶级、其错误显著地表现在以下几方面：一是漠视工人对于领导的批评建议，明明是正确的意见也拖延不加实行，或置之不理，甚至采取压制或变相的压制；二是不关心工人生活，甚至以资本家的态度对待工人。如所谓“工人有的是”；三是把制度、纪律与生产计划和工人积极性脱节，轻视工会工作，想用行政力量解决一切问题，不愿让工人参加工厂管理，甚至采用粗暴的惩办主义。
    这些同志不了解：只有彻底依靠工人阶级，才能办好工厂，发展生产。领导上有一套生产计划，规定好各种制度和劳动纪律，这都是需要的；但有一个必须解决的前提条件，就是发动工人的积极性与创造性。我们所定的一切，如果不与这个基本条件结合，则决定没有做好的可能。我们的计划与制度本身，如果不吸收工人的意见也同样不可能真正合理与完善。
    为此，我们就需要虚心的倾听工人对我们的批评与建议，正确的，要马上接受、实行。工人的生活要求也是一样，只要这要求是正当的，可能做到的，就应当赶快做；万一做不到，也应该耐心解释，不能采取冷淡或不理的态度，更不能打击、压制或惩办。我们要时时刻刻关心工人的生活与困难，像关心自己的骨肉同胞一样。对此采取漠视态度，是原则的错误。
    当然，克服官僚主义，依靠工人阶级，并不是说就不要对工人进行教育和领导了。相反的，无产阶级的先锋队——共产党，必须时时刻刻领导工人学习，加强对工人的教育，以提高他们的政治水平与阶级觉悟。只有这样，才能使工人真正成为领导的阶级，成为工厂的真正的主人翁，才能真正实行工厂管理民主化，达到恢复与发展生产的目的。
