    [Report from this newspaper] In order to ensure the welfare of employees, the Tianjin-Beijing Railway Bureau has recently formulated provisional measures for education subsidies for employees' children. It is stipulated that applicants for this subsidy must be children of current employees and registered with the Railway Bureau. Subsidies will not be granted in any of the following circumstances: (1) students studying at Rotary primary and secondary schools; (2) those who have already received full public funding from the school they are attending; (3) those studying at schools of a remedial nature; (4) those studying at unregistered private schools; (5) those whose overall average grade in the previous semester was failing. Regarding the amount of the subsidy, it is stipulated that: (A) Primary school: All employees with a monthly salary of 72 yuan (including 72 yuan) or less will receive a subsidy for their children attending primary school. Employees with a monthly salary of more than 72 yuan up to 140 yuan (including 140 yuan) will not receive a subsidy for only one child attending primary school, but for those with two or more children, all except one will receive a subsidy. Employees with a monthly salary of more than 140 yuan will not receive a subsidy for two children attending primary school, but for those with three or more children, all except two will receive a subsidy. Those studying in private primary schools will receive a subsidy equivalent to 50 catties of millet per child. Those studying in private middle schools or universities will receive a subsidy equivalent to 100 catties of millet per child. Those studying in public universities, middle schools, and primary schools will receive a full subsidy for all tuition and miscellaneous fees actually collected by the school. If the subsidy amount for public schools at all levels exceeds the subsidy amount for private schools at the same level, it will be issued according to the subsidy amount for private schools. The subsidy amounts for all levels are applicable to the first semester of this year, and the millet price conversion rate will be calculated according to the salary conversion standard at the time of issuance.
