　　A Model Production Report

　　Our newspaper's reporter promptly covered the news that the waterwheels of the Xinji Water Conservancy Promotion Cooperative in Jizhong were in stock and not moving, urging all parties to find ways to get the waterwheels into the hands of the peasants. This provides an excellent example for reporting on this year's great production. We have published many production news items, some of which are just dry plans. As for whether they have been implemented and how much has been done, there has been no follow-up. Some only say "high morale" and "smoothly transitioning to production," but there is neither material nor analysis as to why morale is so high and why it is so smooth. We do not doubt the possibility of such facts existing, but things are not that simple. Many things often go through tortuous and complex processes. For example, peasants urgently need to develop water conservancy, but our work is not good enough, and as a result, not a single waterwheel has been sold. If we were to use a perfunctory approach, we could simply greatly publicize how the local water conservancy work is being carried out and how many waterwheels have been repaired... but we could remain indifferent as to whether they have truly reached the peasants. This bad style has now been mostly corrected, but we must still be very vigilant, because such reports will surely become a cover for bureaucracy, making some empty talkers complacent and causing the working people to shake their heads. The report from Xinji has sobered our minds, allowing our reporters, correspondents, and the broad masses of readers to calmly investigate and study various issues in this year's spring plowing. As long as it is related to the people's lives and production, we should provide it with a responsible spirit towards the people and seek a solution. This is also an indispensable and important task for us to promote the great production movement from the news front.

### 一个生产报导的范例

　　一个生产报导的范例
    本报记者及时采访了冀中辛集水利推进社水车存货未动的消息，要求各方想办法把水车交到农民手中。这对于报导今年大生产提供了一个极好的范例，我们曾发了不少的生产消息，其中有的只是一个干巴巴的计划，至于做了没有，做了多少？至今没有下文。有的只说“情绪高涨”、“顺利地转入生产”，究竟为什么这样高涨，这样顺利？则既无材料也无分析，我们丝毫不怀疑这样事实存在的可能性，但事情并不是这样简单的，许多事情往往要经过曲折复杂过程。譬如农民是迫切需要发展水利的，可是我们的工作作得不够，结果水车至今没有销售出去一辆，要是客里空的手法，当然仅可以大大宣传当地水利工作如何开展，水车修好多少辆……而对于是否真正到了农民手中，却可以不闻不问。这种恶劣作风现在大部分已被纠正，但仍要十分警惕，因为这样的报导，一定会成为官僚主义的掩体，使某些说空话的人看了沾沾自喜，使劳动人民为之摇头。辛集的报导清醒了我们的头脑，让我们的记者、通讯员以及广大读者都来冷静地调查研究今年春耕中各种问题，只要与人民生活和生产有关，都应本对人民负责精神一一提供出来求得解决，这也是我们从新闻战线上来推动大生产运动一个不可少的重要的工作。
