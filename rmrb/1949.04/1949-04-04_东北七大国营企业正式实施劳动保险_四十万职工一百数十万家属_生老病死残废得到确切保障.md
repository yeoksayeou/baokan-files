Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 2nd: The seven major state-owned enterprises in Northeast China – railways, mines, military industry, military supplies, post and telecommunications, electricity, and textiles – officially implemented labor insurance on April 1st. A total of approximately 400,000 employees and over 1.1 million family members will enjoy the benefits stipulated by the Labor Insurance Regulations. In the three months since the Northeast Administrative Committee promulgated the Wartime Provisional Labor Insurance Regulations, the seven major state-owned enterprise systems have actively carried out various preparatory tasks related to the implementation of labor insurance. The most important thing was to conduct extensive and in-depth publicity among the masses of employees, mobilizing them to discuss the meaning and content of the Labor Insurance Regulations, so that the broad masses of employees recognized that this was a great achievement won by the working class under the leadership of the Communist Party, and also recognized that this was a wartime provisional measure. Only after the national liberation and the restoration and development of production can labor insurance be better implemented. The Northeast Federation of Trade Unions and the Northeast Administrative Committee Labor Bureau extensively solicited opinions from employees, and after detailed discussions at the Enlarged Labor Insurance Conference held in early February, drafted the trial implementation rules, which were approved and promulgated by the Northeast Administrative Committee. Each enterprise system has established labor insurance committees at all levels and grass-roots review committees. Departments such as railways and military industry have also established labor insurance officers in groups. The complex labor insurance registration work was basically completed by the end of March due to the mobilization of the broad masses of employees to work together. After two months of investigation and statistics on employees' birth, old age, illness, death, and disability, most units have made preliminary estimates. The labor insurance committees of each enterprise have all determined the procedures and documents for requesting and receiving labor insurance funds, the labor insurance accounting system, and medical treatment and procedures. In January and February, the seven major enterprises paid a total of 19 billion yuan in labor insurance funds, and the March funds are being paid. According to incomplete statistics, enterprises and factories including 220,000 employees have established 10 hospitals and 76 clinics with 254 doctors. Factories with more female workers are improving and preparing to set up nurseries. Employees' children's schools and other welfare undertakings are also being planned for improvement. In the process of preparation, employees who died or were injured on duty, and female workers who gave birth, have all enjoyed the benefits stipulated by the Labor Insurance Regulations.
