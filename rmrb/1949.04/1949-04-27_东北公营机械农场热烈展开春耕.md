    【Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 26th】The twelve state-owned mechanized farms in Northeast China are vigorously launching spring plowing. Tractor teams from various farms have been dispatched one after another, and 161,500 mu of fertile land will soon be completely cultivated. The Northeast Farm, the largest of the four mechanized farms directly under the Ministry of Agriculture, dispatched seventeen tractors a few days ago. All staff members unanimously pledged to complete the sowing of 15,000 mu of wheat and the cultivation of 10,000 mu of large fields (for planting soybeans, sorghum, corn, etc.) by the beginning of May. The eight mechanized farms operated by various provinces have also begun sowing wheat. The 42 tractors of the Pingyang Farm in Heilongjiang have workers who guarantee that they will complete the turning and harrowing of 60,000 mu of paddy fields and 11,000 mu of dry land by early May.
