Editor's note: After the successive liberation of cities such as Beiping, Tianjin, Tangshan, and Zhangjiakou, the central task of the Party in these cities is to rapidly restore and develop production, transforming consumer cities into productive cities. However, to achieve this goal, it is first necessary to correctly implement the policy of the workers' movement and protect industry and commerce, and to resolutely struggle against "leftist" and rightist tendencies in the implementation of these policies. To this end, we are republishing the Xinhua News Agency's "February 7th" anniversary editorial from 1948, "Adhere to the Correct Line in the Workers' Movement and Oppose 'Leftist' Adventurism," Comrade Ren Bishi's report from January of the same year regarding the policy of protecting industry and commerce, and the Xinhua News Agency's short commentary from September of the same year, "Correctly Implement the Policy of Labor-Capital Benefit," in succession. These documents point out, on the one hand, the dangers of "leftist" errors in the workers' movement, stating that they "damage or reduce production, which is harmful to the liberated areas, harmful to the victory of the war, and harmful to the construction of a new democratic society, the extent of which is as terrible as the Kuomintang bandit gang's 'three alls' policy." On the other hand, they also point out the possible rightist errors in urban work: "Protecting the legitimate and proper interests of industrialists and businessmen does not mean that we should unconditionally help their operations that are detrimental to the national economy, or that we can ignore safeguarding the various rights that workers should enjoy." Therefore, it is emphasized that all relevant leading organs should prevent the occurrence of either of the above-mentioned biases at all times and places, ensuring the correct implementation of the policy of "developing production, promoting the economy, taking into account both public and private interests, and benefiting both labor and capital." These instructions are very beneficial for helping comrades in urban work to better grasp policies and for helping people from all walks of life to further understand our Party's policies. It is hoped that all localities will conduct in-depth study in conjunction with the inspection of urban policies.

　　　
    The first great strike movement of the Chinese working class against the imperialist running dog warlords—the Beijing-Hankou Railway (i.e., Ping-Han Railway) Great Strike—has now been exactly twenty-five years ago. For the past twenty-five years, the Chinese working class and the Chinese people have commemorated this significant day of February 7th every year, because the Beijing-Hankou Railway Great Strike demonstrated the political consciousness and organization of the Chinese working class, and showed that the working class is the advanced class and the most revolutionary class of the Chinese people.
    Twenty-five years have passed, and the cause left behind by the "February 7th" martyrs, such as Comrades Shi Yang and Lin Xiangqian, is about to be completed. Imperialism and feudal forces will be swept away throughout China. The democratic power of the working class, peasants, petty bourgeoisie, middle bourgeoisie, intellectuals, and other patriotic elements has been established in the liberated areas with a population of 160 million, and will be established throughout the country. The glorious achievements of the "February 7th" martyrs will be immortal.
    The Beijing-Hankou Railway Great Strike is a glorious page in the history of the revolutionary workers' movement in our country. The current situation is that some of our country's large cities, railways, and mines have been liberated, and more large cities, railways, and mines will be liberated. On the other hand, the construction of industry and railways in various liberated areas, especially the Northeast liberated area, is actively underway, and this construction must be carried out on a larger scale in the future. Therefore, the workers' movement in the liberated areas will be raised to a more important position, and whether the direction of the workers' movement is correct will inevitably have a greater impact on the development of the revolutionary war and the development of new democratic construction than ever before. We would like to take the opportunity of commemorating the twenty-fifth anniversary of "February 7th" to explain the direction of the workers' movement in the liberated areas.
    The revolutionary workers' movement in the liberated areas and the revolutionary workers' movement in the Kuomintang-controlled areas have the same general goal: this general goal is to strive for the democratic liberation of the working class and all oppressed people, and to establish a new democratic China. However, under the same general goal, the specific policies of the revolutionary workers' movement in two different regions are different, and in many respects, even diametrically opposed. This is because in these two different regions, the political and social status of workers and their status in enterprises are different, and in many respects are diametrically opposed.
    In the Kuomintang-controlled areas, workers are the most lowly slaves in society. Their labor produces profits for imperialism and bureaucratic capital. Their lives are regarded by imperialism and the Kuomintang as worthless as ants. They have no human rights or freedom. In such a tragic environment, the working class must wage a struggle for survival, and in order to liberate themselves and liberate all oppressed people, they must fight to overthrow the state power of imperialism and the big landlord and big bourgeoisie, just like the "February 7th" strike. However, in the liberated areas, the political and social status of workers has fundamentally changed and is completely different. Workers, like peasants, petty bourgeoisie, middle bourgeoisie, intellectuals, and other patriotic elements, have become the masters of the country and society. The working class is especially respected by all the people because it is the advanced class, the most revolutionary class. In such an environment, the working class must support its own democratic politics and the people's democratic politics, and take the lead in playing a vanguard and exemplary role in striving for the victory of the revolutionary war and the construction of a new democratic society.
    The status of workers in enterprises is also different. In the Kuomintang-controlled areas, there are enterprises of bureaucratic capital and enterprises of national capital. In the enterprises of bureaucratic capital, the status of workers is that of slaves of bureaucratic capitalists. Their struggle for survival is often linked to resistance to the oppression of the rulers. In the enterprises of national capital, they are exploited by capitalists, and at the same time, they are oppressed by bureaucratic capital, the Jiang Jieshi bandit gang government, and imperialism together with the national capitalists. On the one hand, for the sake of life, they must make demands to the capitalists to improve their lives. On the other hand, in order to resist the oppression of bureaucratic capital and the rulers, they should unite with the national capitalists and carry out a common struggle. The situation in the liberated areas is completely different. In the state-owned enterprises and cooperative-run enterprises in the liberated areas, the owners of the enterprises are the political power and cooperatives organized by the liberated people. Therefore, the workers in these enterprises are themselves the owners of the enterprises. There is no exploiter and exploited here, no oppressor and oppressed, and therefore there is no and cannot be the so-called opposition between "capital" and "labor," or the opposition between "business owner" and non-business owner. In private enterprises in the liberated areas, workers have a dual status: one is the status of the exploited (the status of the labor side); the other is the status of the masters of the society and leaders of the state power. Because they are exploited, workers have contradictions with private capitalists in their daily interests, but because they are also the masters of the society and leaders of the state power, workers should endure a certain degree of exploitation for their long-term interests so that these private enterprises can carry out production and appropriately develop production to prosper the economy of the liberated areas, support the victory on the front lines, and gradually and reliably develop the new democratic society in the direction of the future socialist society due to the great increase in productivity. It should be known that the difference between a new democratic society and a socialist society is that in a new democratic society, private capital enterprises are still an indispensable component in production. Destroying this part of the enterprise is very detrimental to the working class and all the people and their state power. Precisely because of this, workers should resolutely oppose those private capitalists who carry out strikes, close factories, and carry out sabotage, and at the same time, for those private capitalists who are willing to continue production, they should work together to develop production, prosper the economy of the liberated areas, and on this basis, on the one hand, ensure the appropriate life of the workers, and on the other hand, ensure the appropriate profits of the private capitalists. This kind of labor-capital relationship is completely different from the labor-capital struggle that should be carried out in the Kuomintang-controlled areas.
    From the above basic analysis, we can see how drastically different the social status and the status of workers in enterprises are in the Kuomintang-controlled areas and the liberated areas.
    From this, it can be understood why the policy of the revolutionary workers' movement in the liberated areas should be drastically different from the policy of the revolutionary workers' movement in the Kuomintang-controlled areas.
    The policy of the workers' movement in the Kuomintang-controlled areas is to use all methods to ensure that workers do not starve to death, and to use all methods to overthrow the reactionary government. The revolutionary workers' movement in the liberated areas does not have these tasks, because in the liberated areas, workers are not threatened by starvation, and the reactionary government has long been overthrown. Therefore, the policy of the revolutionary workers' movement in the liberated areas should be thoroughly changed; changed to patiently persuading workers to implement the economic policy of "increasing production, promoting the economy, taking into account both public and private interests, and benefiting both labor and capital" as said by Chairman Mao.
    It should be explained to the workers that revitalizing industry is the most important task for winning the war, and it is also the most important task for building a new democratic society. Destroying or reducing production is harmful to the liberated areas, harmful to the victory of the war, and harmful to the construction of a new democratic society, and its terribleness is the same as the "three alls" policy of the Jiang Jieshi bandit gang.
    It should be explained to the workers that industrial production in the liberated areas is not the responsibility of others, but is the responsibility of the working class and its vanguard, the Chinese Communist Party. The peasants in the liberated areas are fully responsible for agricultural production by handing over large amounts of public grain and performing heavy war service. Workers should also bear the responsibility of industrial production in the same way. Not only in state-owned enterprises and cooperative-run enterprises, the workers must bear complete responsibility for production, but also in private enterprises, the workers also bear most of the responsibility for production, although private capitalists are also responsible.
    It should be explained to the workers that the reason why workers are respected by the people of the liberated areas is not for other reasons, but only because the working class is the advanced class and the most revolutionary class among the people. Workers should set an example for the people and lead the people forward with their infinite loyalty and great contribution to the revolution. In order to win the victory of the revolutionary war and the success of new democratic construction, workers should endure hardship and do more work. They should learn from the examples of many model workers, such as Comrade Zhao Zhankui. Under the circumstances of war, it is not to work eight hours, but to work ten hours, and other labor conditions should not be set too high, and should not violate the limits permitted by economic conditions, and should not violate the general principle of developing production, promoting the economy, taking into account both public and private interests, and benefiting both labor and capital.
    Workers should be led to learn to manage production. In state-owned enterprises and cooperative-run enterprises, under the leadership of the factory director, organize factory management committees, absorb worker representatives to participate, and discuss how to reduce costs, increase the quantity and quality of production, and how to solve and improve the various complex problems in the process of purchasing raw materials, manufacturing finished products, and selling finished products. This management method should also be persuaded to private capitalists in private enterprises to try it out. In the management committee of private enterprises, in addition to discussing the above-mentioned issues, it can also stipulate a certain profit for private capitalists and a certain treatment for workers to achieve labor-capital benefit.
    Chairman Mao pointed out in "The Present Situation and Our Tasks": "Adopting overly left-leaning and erroneous policies towards the economic components of the petty bourgeoisie and the middle bourgeoisie, such as 'excessively high labor conditions, excessively high income tax rates, infringing upon industrialists and businessmen in land reform, not taking the development of production, promoting the economy, taking into account both public and private interests, and benefiting both labor and capital as the goal, but taking the short-sighted and one-sided so-called workers' welfare as the goal,' as we committed during the period from 1931 to 1934; is absolutely not allowed to be repeated. If these mistakes are repeated, they will inevitably harm the interests of the laboring masses and the interests of the new democratic country." Chairman Mao's instruction is very important for the workers' movement in the liberated areas. The leaders of the workers' movement must never take the short-sighted and one-sided so-called workers' welfare as the goal and put forward excessively high labor conditions. The policy of the workers' movement in the liberated areas should strictly conform to the new democratic economic policy, that is, developing production, promoting the economy, taking into account both public and private interests, and benefiting both labor and capital. Everything that conforms to this should be developed, and everything that violates this should be corrected.
    It must be pointed out that until now, there are still many members of the Chinese Communist Party, many cadres, many trade union workers, and even many leading personnel who hold high leadership positions who do not understand the Party's industrial policy and the line of the workers' movement. They only see the trees and do not see the forest. They only know the one-sided, narrow, and short-sighted so-called "workers' interests," and cannot look a little further. They have forgotten the great damage that the left-leaning adventurist industrial policy and the line of the workers' movement implemented during the period from 1931 to 1934 gave to the working class, the laboring people, and the revolutionary government. They completely do not study the correct industrial policies and the workers' movement policies issued by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in the past eleven years since 1937, and they stubbornly resist the Party's line. Many local leading organs of the Party have not even formally discussed and publicized and explained the Central Committee's line for a long time, so that the comrades in the workers' movement work completely do not understand the Central Committee's line, and they have reached such a state of numbness. This situation can no longer continue. All local leading organs of the Party must seriously discuss the Central Committee's line and the entire industrial policy and workers' movement policy, resolutely correct all left-leaning adventurist thoughts, policies, and methods that endanger the working class, the laboring people, and the revolutionary government, and quickly put industrial construction and the workers' movement on the right track. Only in this way can we gather all forces to overthrow imperialism and the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, liberate the Chinese nation and the Chinese people, and establish a new democratic China.

### 坚持职工运动的正确路线　反对“左”倾冒险主义

专栏：

　　坚持职工运动的正确路线
  　反对“左”倾冒险主义
    编者按：北平、天津、唐山、张垣等城市相继解放后，在这些城市中党的中心任务，是迅速恢复与发展生产，把消费的城市变为生产的城市。但要达到这个目的首先必须正确执行职工运动的方针与保护工商业的政策，与执行这些政策中“左”的和右的倾向作坚决的斗争。为此，我们特将新华社一九四八年“二七”纪念社论“坚持职工运动中的正确路线反对‘左’倾冒险主义”，同年一月任弼时同志报告中关于保护工商业的政策部分，及同年九月新华社短评“正确执行劳资两利方针”等文件，重新陆续发表。在这些文件中，一方面指出职工运动中“左”倾错误危害，它“破坏或降低生产，是危害解放区的，危害战争胜利的，危害新民主主义社会建设的，其可怕的程度是与蒋介石匪帮的‘三光政策’是一样的。”另一方面，又指出了城市工作中可能发生的右倾错误：“保护工商业主合法的正当的利益，并不是说因此就无原则地帮助其不利于国民经济的经营，就可以不注意保障工人应享有的各种权利。”因而着重指出：一切有关的领导机关，应该随时随地防止上述任何一种偏向的发生，保证“发展生产，繁荣经济，公私兼顾，劳资两利”政策的正确执行。这些指示，对于帮助城市工作同志更好掌握政策和帮助各阶层人民进一步了解我党政策，是非常有益的，希望各地结合城市政策的检查进行深入的学习。
    　　　
    中国工人阶级第一次伟大的反对帝国主义走狗军阀的罢工运动——京汉铁路（即平汉铁路）大罢工，到现在已经整整的二十五年了。二十五年来，中国工人阶级与中国人民年年纪念二月七日这个意义重大的日子，因为京汉铁路大罢工，显示了中国工人阶级的政治觉悟和组织性，显示了工人阶级是中国人民的先进阶级、最革命的阶级。
    二十五年过去了，“二七”烈士施洋、林祥谦等同志所遗下的事业将要完成，帝国主义与封建势力将要在全中国被扫除，工人阶级、农民、小资产阶级、中等资产阶级、知识分子与其他爱国分子的民主政权，已经在一万万六千万人口的解放区中建立起来，并将要在全国建立起来，“二七”烈士的光荣业迹是永垂不朽的。
    京汉铁路大罢工，在我国革命的职工运动历史中，是光荣的一页。现在的情况是我国的一部分大城市、铁路、矿山已经解放了，更多的大城市、铁路、矿山将被解放；另一方面，各解放区首先是东北解放区，工业和铁路的建设，已在积极进行，此种建设在今后必须更大规模地进行。因此，解放区职工运动将被提到更加重要的地位，职工运动的方针是否正确，对于革命战争的发展和新民主主义建设的发展，必然发生较之以往更加巨大的影响。我们愿趁着纪念“二七”二十五周年的机会，对于解放区职工运动的方针加以说明。
    解放区的革命的职工运动与蒋管区的革命的职工运动，有同一的总目标：这个总目标就是争取工人阶级和一切被压迫人民的民主解放，建立新民主主义的中国。但是在同一的总目标之下，革命的职工运动在两个不同地区的具体方针则是不同的，在许多方面，甚至是截然相反的。这是因为在这两个不同的地区里，工人在政治上、社会上的地位和在企业中的地位是不同的，在许多方面是截然相反的。
    在蒋管区，工人在社会上是最底微的奴隶，他们的劳动是替帝国主义和官僚资本生产利润，他们的生命被帝国主义与国民党看的象蚂蚁一样不值钱，他们没有人权和自由。在这样悲惨的环境中，工人阶级必须为了活命而作救死求生的斗争，并且为了解放自己与解放一切被压迫的人民起见，必须为推翻帝国主义与大地主大资产阶级的国家政权而斗争，如象“二七”的罢工斗争一样。但是在解放区，工人的政治社会地位，是根本改变和截然不同了，工人与农民、小资产阶级、中等资产阶级、知识分子和其他爱国分子一样，都做了国家和社会的主人翁。工人阶级被一切人民特别尊敬，因为它是先进的阶级，最革命的阶级。在这样的环境中，工人阶级必然拥护自己与人民的民主政治，为争取革命战争的胜利，为新民主主义社会的建设起先锋带头的领导作用与模范作用。
    工人在企业中的地位，也是不同的。在蒋管区，有官僚资本的企业和民族资本的企业，在官僚资本的企业中，工人的地位是官僚资本家的奴隶，他们救死求生的斗争，常常与反抗统治者的压迫联结起来。在民族资本的企业中，他们受到资本家的剥削，同时又与民族资本家一同受到官僚资本、蒋介石匪帮政府与帝国主义的压迫。他们一方面为了生活，须向资本家提出改善生活的要求，另一方面为了反抗官僚资本及统治者的压迫，又应与民族资本家联合起来，进行共同斗争。在解放区情形就截然不同了。在解放区的公营企业与合作社经营的企业中，企业的主人是解放了的人民组织起来的政权与合作社，因而在这些企业中的工人，本身就是企业的主人。这里没有剥削者与被剥削者，没有压迫者与被压迫者，因而没有而且不可能有所谓“资方”与“劳方”的对立，所谓“企业主”与非企业主的对立。在解放区的私营企业中，工人有两重地位：一是被剥削者的地位（劳方的地位）；一是社会主人翁的地位，国家政权的领导者的地位。因为是被剥削者，工人在自己的日常利益上与私人资本家有矛盾，但因为又是社会的主人翁，国家政权的领导者，工人便应该为了自己的长远利益，忍受一定限度的剥削，使这些私人企业能够进行生产，并适当地发展生产，以繁荣解放区的经济，支援前线的胜利，并使新民主主义的社会因生产力的大大提高，而逐步地有依据地发展到将来的社会主义社会的方向去。应当知道，新民主主义社会与社会主义社会不同之点，就是在新民主主义社会里，私人资本的企业在生产中还是不可缺少的成份，破坏这部分企业，对于工人阶级和全体人民及其国家政权是非常不利的。正因为如此，工人应当坚决反对那些进行怠工、进行关厂、进行破坏的私人资本家，同时对于愿意继续生产下去的私人资本家，则应当与之共同工作，发展生产，繁荣解放区的经济，并在这个基础上，一方面确定保证工人的适当生活，另一方面保证私人资本家的适当利润。这种劳资关系与在蒋管区所应进行的劳资斗争，是截然不同的。
    从以上的基本分析里就可以看到，在蒋管区与解放区工人在社会上的地位和在企业中的地位是怎样的截然不同。
    从此就可以明白，解放区的革命的职工运动的方针，为什么要与蒋管区的革命的职工运动的方针截然不同。
    在蒋管区职工运动的方针，是用一切方法来保障工作不致于饿死，和用一切方法来推翻反动政府。在解放区革命的职工运动就没有这些任务了，因为在解放区工人没有饥饿的威胁，反动政府早已推翻，在解放区革命的职工运动的方针，因此应当彻底改变；改变到耐心的说服工人来实行毛主席所说的“增加生产，繁荣经济，公私兼顾，劳资两利”的经济政策。
    应当向工人说明：振兴工业是争取战争胜利的最首要的任务，也是建设新民主主义社会的最首要的任务，而破坏或降低生产是危害解放区的，危害战争胜利的，危害新民主主义社会的建设的，其可怕的程度与蒋介石匪帮的“三光政策”是一样的。
    应当向工人说明：解放区的工业生产，不是由别人负责，而是由工人阶级及其先锋队中国共产党负责的，解放区的农民对农业生产交大量的公粮，服繁重的战争勤务，是尽力负责的。工人应当把工业生产的责任，同样负担起来。不但公营企业与合作社经营的企业里，工人对于生产要担负完完全全的责任，而且在私营企业里，工人对生产也负了大部分责任，虽然私人资本家也要负责。
    应当向工人说明：工人所以受到解放区人民的尊敬，不是为了别的原因，仅是为了工人阶级在人民中是先进的阶级，最革命的阶级，工人应该以自己对革命的无限忠诚与伟大贡献来做人民的榜样，领导人民前进。为了争取革命战争的胜利与新民主主义建设的成功，工人应该吃得苦，做得多，应该学习许多模范工人如赵占魁同志等的榜样。在战争的情况下，不是做八小时工作，而是做十小时工作，其他劳动条件亦不可定得太高，不可违背经济情况所许可的限度，不可违背发展生产，繁荣经济，公私兼顾，劳资两利的总原则。
    应当领导工人去学习管理生产，在公营企业与合作社经营的企业中，在厂长的领导下，组织工厂管理委员会，吸收工人代表参加，讨论如何减轻成本，提高生产的数量和质量，如何解决与改善由购进原料、制造成品与推销成品过程中的各种复杂问题。这种管理方法亦应在私人企业中说服私人资本家试办，在私人企业的管理委员会中，除了讨论上述问题外，并可规定私人资本家一定的利润和工人的一定的待遇，以实现劳资两利。
    毛主席在“目前形势和我们的任务”中指出：“对于小资产阶级及中等资产阶级经济成份采取过左的错误的政策，如象我们党在一九三一至一九三四年期间所犯过的那样‘过高的劳动条件，过高的所得税率，在土地改革中侵犯工商业者、不以发展生产，繁荣经济，公私兼顾，劳资两利为目标，而以近视的片面的所谓劳动者福利为目标’；是绝对不许重复的。这些错误如果重犯，必然要损害劳动群众的利益及新民主主义国家的利益”。毛主席这个指示，对于解放区职工运动是非常重要的，职工运动的领导者们，绝对不许可以近视的片面的所谓劳动者福利为目标，提出过高的劳动条件。解放区职工运动的方针，应当严格的符合于新民主主义的经济政策，这就是发展生产，繁荣经济，公私兼顾，劳资两利。一切与此符合的应该发展，一切与此违背的应当改正过来。
    必须指出：直到现在，中国共产党内还有不少的党员，不少的干部，不少的工会工作人员，甚至不少的担负高级领导地位的领导人员，并不了解党的工业政策与职工运动的路线，他们只看见树木，不看见森林，他们只知道片面的狭隘的近视的所谓“工人利益”，而不能稍微看远一点。他们忘记了一九三一至一九三四年时期内实行过的那种左倾冒险主义的工业政策与职工运动路线，曾经给予工人阶级劳动人民与革命政府以何等重大的损害，他们完全不研究一九三七年以来十一年内中共中央历次发布的正确的工业政策与职工运动方针，他们固执地抵抗党的路线。许多党的地方领导机关，在长时期内甚至没有正式讨论与宣传解释过中央的路线，以致于使得工运工作同志，完全不了解中央的路线，他们竟达到如此麻木不仁的地步，这种情况再也不能继续下去了。党的一切地方领导机关，必须严肃地讨论中央的路线及全部工业政策与工运方针，坚决的纠正一切危害工人阶级劳动人民及革命政府的左倾冒险主义的思想、政策与办法，迅速地使工业建设与工人运动走入正轨。只有这样，我们才能聚积一切力量，打倒帝国主义与国民党反动统治，解放中华民族与中国人民，建立新民主主义的中国。
