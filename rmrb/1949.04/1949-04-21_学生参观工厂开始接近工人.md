　　[Ping City News] The students of Wenhua Girls' High School visited the Yanjing Paper Mill and Mentougou Coal Mine on the 15th and 16th, and had individual talks with the workers. Everyone agreed that the past notions of looking down on workers, arrogance, and conceit were completely wrong. We should learn from the workers in the future. (Wenhua Girls' High School Communication Group)
　　[Another News] Students from Ping City Higher Commercial School, taking advantage of the spring break, departed for Changxindian at eight o'clock in the morning on the 16th to visit the railway machinery factory. After returning, the general student body further understood the great significance of the saying "the working class is creating the wealth of the world." (Hua)
