　　Promoting a Simple Work Style
  　Tianjin Municipal Party Committee Organs
  　Save 7,000 Kilowatts of Electricity
    Beijing Municipality Also Saves One-Third of Electricity Consumption
    [Tianjin News] In order to increase industrial electricity consumption and better develop production, the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China promotes saving electricity, reducing light bulbs, and reducing wattage. As early as mid-February, the Municipal Committee had already paid attention to the problem of saving electricity, stipulating that all lights must be turned off when sleeping, light bulbs should be appropriately reduced, electric stoves are forbidden, etc., and called on everyone to earnestly implement these measures. Subsequently, a further specific investigation was conducted, and it was found that most of the original light bulbs were 60 watts, and the highest was 100 watts. According to actual needs, it was stipulated to reduce light bulbs and wattage: each dormitory room should only have one light, offices should average two or more people sharing one light, collective offices, conference rooms, and reception rooms should maintain 60 to 40 watts, general offices, leaders' offices, clerical offices, accounting offices, material rooms, etc., should maintain 40 to 25 watts, and the rest should be changed to 15 watts. The original light bulbs in the Municipal Committee organs consumed a total of 11,520 kilowatts of electricity. After reducing and changing them, they now only consume 3,720 kilowatts, saving a total of 7,800 kilowatts of electricity, which can solve the power problem for four factories with eight-horsepower electric motors.
    [Our Newspaper News] Various organs in Beijing Municipality have begun to pay attention to saving electricity. The city's electricity consumption has been reduced by about one-third compared to the past. Many organs have stipulated a number of electricity-saving methods, such as using desk lamps instead of overhead lights, turning off lights when leaving rooms, and comprehensively planning to reduce the number of light bulbs, etc. The effects are also very significant. One organ in the Dongcheng District with less than 100 people initially planned to reduce 23 light bulbs. However, some departments still have a phenomenon of wasting electricity, which urgently needs to be corrected.

　　发扬朴素作风
  　天津市委机关
  　节省电力七千千瓦
    平市亦节用电力三分之一
    【天津讯】为增加工业用电，更好地发展生产，本市中共市委机关提倡节省电力，减少灯头和度数。早在二月中旬，市委即已注意节省电力问题，规定睡着一律熄灯，适当减少灯头，不准生电炉等，号召大家切实执行。随后并进一步作具体调查，发现原来灯头，大部都是六十度，最高的有一百度，当根据实际需要，规定减少灯头和度数：宿舍每室只安一灯，办公室平均两人以上共用一灯，集体办公室、会议室、会客室保持六十度至四十度，一般办公室、首长室、文书室、会计室、材料室等保持四十度至二十五度，其余一律改为十五度。市委机关原有灯头共用电一万一千五百二十千瓦，减少和改换之后，现只用电三千七百二十千瓦，共节省电力七千八百千瓦，约可解决四个具有八匹马力电动机的工厂的动力问题。
    【本报讯】平市各机关已开始注意节用电力。全市用电量较过去减少了约三分之一。许多机关规定了若干节电的办法，如用台灯就不开挂灯，离开房子就随手关灯，通盘筹划减少灯头等，效果亦甚显著。东城某一不足百人的机关，经初步计划，减少了二十三个灯头。但某些部门仍有浪费电力现象，亟待纠正。
