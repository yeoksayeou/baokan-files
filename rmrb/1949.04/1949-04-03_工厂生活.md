    ▲ 70th Arsenal: After the Trade Union Preparatory Committee was established, it immediately organized a correspondence group, with more than 70 correspondents spread throughout the internal and external factory units. "70th Life" is published every Tuesday and Friday, reflecting the workers' labor life, inventions and creations, attitudes towards the world political situation, and workers' works in production competitions.

    After the Trade Union Cooperative took over and inventoried the old cooperative, it immediately solicited shares and opened for business. The workers were very happy to buy things at their own cooperative.

    ▲ North Hebei Electric Power Company: The "Employee Life" newspaper is published every Tuesday and Friday, responding to the call of the People's Government. As soon as the sanitation movement began, all employees of the factory immediately mobilized and worked together to move the warehouse that had not been cleaned up for twenty years. A reading room was also opened, specially for the field staff to prepare various books. There are many people reading books.

    ▲ Dongzhimen Water Plant of the Water Company: The Trade Union Preparatory Committee has organized many employee welfare institutions, literacy classes, reading groups, singing teams, Yangko teams, and cooperatives. The workers are particularly interested in reading newspapers. One worker said: "Before, I didn't understand why the city should lead the countryside. Isn't it okay for everyone to do their own thing? After studying it, I realized there's a reason in it!"

    ▲ Second Sewing Department of the Clothing Factory: The Second Sewing Department has its own small library. Every day after get off work at noon, the workers borrow books while eating cornbread. "The Chinese Revolution and the Chinese Communist Party" and "On Coalition Government" are always borrowed quickly by those who come first. The Second Sewing Department organized a Yangko team, and after get off work at noon, they beat gongs and drums in the yard, twisting and turning. When the time is up, they rush back to work.

    ▲ Tram Company: "100 trams out of the factory for May Day!" This is the slogan of the tram company workers. They want to use practical work to welcome "May Day."

    The tram company publishes its own mimeographed newspaper, and also has a blackboard newspaper, reporting daily on how workers are working hard, speeding up repairs, and studying revolutionary theory.

    ▲ Ping City Telecommunications Bureau: During the Kuomintang rule, the workers of the bureau had secret study organizations and secretly read progressive books. After liberation, the workers' enthusiasm for learning was brought into play, and soon more than 2,000 employees joined the learning craze. They established book circulation groups, where everyone pooled money to buy books and circulated them in turn. The Dong Chang'an Street Business Office of the bureau called on workers to raise funds to buy books, and raised 14,000 yuan in three days, buying more than 200 new books. The works of Chairman Mao purchased by the bureau's Employee Cultural Service Center are often in short supply. (Yu)

    工厂生活
　　办合作社　开图书馆　出版报纸　开展娱乐
    ▲七十兵工厂：工会筹备会成立后立即筹组通讯组，通讯员七十余人遍布内外厂各单位。每星期二、五出版“七十生活”，反映工人劳动生活，创造发明和对世界政治大势的态度，生产比赛中的工人作品。
    工会合作社接收清点旧合作社后，立即召股开办，工人们很高兴在自己的合作社买东西。
    ▲冀北电力公司：每逢二、五出版“职工生活”报，响应人民政府的号召。清洁运动一起，全厂职工立即动员起来，一齐动手搬运二十年没有整理过的仓库。又辟了一个阅览室，专为外勤的职工准备各种书籍。看书的人特别多。
    ▲自来水公司东直门水厂：工会筹备会组织了许多职工福利事业机构，识字班、读报组、歌咏队、秧歌队、合作社。工友们特别对读报发生兴趣。一个工友说：“以前我不懂为什么要城市领导乡村，各干各的不行吗？研究以后，才知道里边还有道理！”
    ▲被服厂第二缝纫部：第二缝纫部自己有一个小型图书馆，每天中午下班后，工友们一边吃窝窝头，一边来借书。“中国革命与中国共产党”、“论联合政府”老借不到，都给先到的人借去了。第二缝纫部组织了一个秧歌队，中午下班后，就在院子里大锣大鼓，前仰后翻都扭起来了。时间一到，一涌又上班去了。
    ▲电车公司：“五一节百辆出厂！”这是电车公司工人的口号，他们要用实际工作来迎接“五一”。
    电车公司自己出了一份油印小报，另外还有黑板报，每天报告工人怎样努力工作，加紧修车，学习革命理论。
    ▲平市电讯局：国民党统治时期，该局工人曾有秘密学习组织，偷读进步书籍，解放后，工人的学习热情得以发挥，很快地就有二千多职工卷入了学习的热潮。他们建立了图书流通小组，由大家共同出钱买书，轮流传阅。该局东长安街营业处号召工人募款买书，三天就募了一万四千元，买得新书二百多种。该局职工文化服务社所购之毛主席著作，时常是供不应求。　　　　　　（雨）
