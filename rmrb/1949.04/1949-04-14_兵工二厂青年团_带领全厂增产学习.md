　　【Taihang Telegram】Since the establishment of the New Democratic Youth League in the Second Ordnance Factory under the North China Enterprise Department on the 6th of last month, the factory's production, learning, and life have become more intense and active, driven by the exemplary role of the Youth League members. The factory has a total of forty-eight Youth League members. At the beginning of its establishment, the Youth League General Branch called on the members to unite all employees by ensuring increased production and respecting teachers and loving apprentices, in order to strengthen and consolidate the League organization. The Youth League members unanimously responded to this call and first led the masses in formulating production plans. Under the promotion of Youth League members, the output of the carpentry department and the file department has greatly increased. After joining the League, material clerk Zhao Wuxing tidies the warehouse once a day, and his study is also particularly intense. Ma Dongsheng, a Youth League member in the foundry department, actively studies and helps everyone else study. The Youth League members are all working hard to improve themselves. The youth department of the directly subordinate team constantly seeks opinions from the League leaders and quickly corrects any shortcomings that are pointed out. Employees who have not joined the Youth League have also put forward applications for joining the League, with "guaranteeing the completion of production tasks" as a condition. At present, the factory's Youth League is planning to develop League members through the development of production; and organize cultural and technical learning to welcome the arrival of the "May Fourth" Youth Day.

    【太行电】华北企业部所属兵工二厂，自上月六日正式建立起新民主主义青年团后，全厂的生产、学习、生活，在青年团员的模范作用推动下，较前紧张活跃。该厂共有团员四十八人。开始建立时，团总支即号召团员以保证提高生产及做到尊师爱徒来团结全体职工，壮大巩固团的组织。团员们一致响应了这一号召，首先带领群众，订出生产计划。木工部、锉刀部在青年团员推动下，产量有很大增加。材料员赵五星入团后每天整理库房一次，学习也特别紧张。翻砂部团员马冬生积极学习，并帮助大家学习。团员们都在积极努力提高自己。直属队的青年部，不断征求团领导上对他们的意见，提出缺点即很快改正。未参加青年团的职工也纷纷提出以“保证完成生产任务”为条件，申请入团。现该厂青年团正拟从发展生产中发展团员；并组织文化、技术学习，以迎接“五四”青年节的到来。
