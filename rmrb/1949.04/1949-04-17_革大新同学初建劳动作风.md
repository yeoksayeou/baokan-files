　　【Ping City News】 Some new students at the Revolutionary University who had never participated in labor felt unaccustomed to even the small task of picking up a chair when they first arrived at the school. After studying Comrade Huang Jing's "Worldview" report, they began to dislike their past parasitic lives and started to establish a revolutionary and simple style. Many students who went into the city on Sundays did not take the bus even if they had blisters on their feet. Many class wall newspapers put forward challenges and mutually established covenants: no dining in restaurants, no drinking alcohol. They also suggested that the government should not distribute money when issuing shoes, so as to avoid waste.

　　革大新同学初建劳动作风
    【平市讯】革大一些没参加过劳动的新同学，才到学校时，连领取椅子的一点劳动也感觉不习惯，学习了黄敬同志的“人生观”报告后，对过去的寄生生活开始厌恶，革命的朴素作风开始树立：许多同学星期日进城，脚上磨了泡也不坐车。许多班的墙报上提出挑战，互立公约：不下馆子、不喝酒。并建议公家发鞋时不要发钱，以免浪费。
