The Women's Congress Continues

　　Group Discussions on the Constitution of the Democratic Women's Federation
　　Representatives Nominated to Participate in the Preparatory Work for the Youth Congress
　　[Our Newspaper] The First National Congress of Chinese Women continued its discussions yesterday morning (the 31st) at Huiren Hall. 444 representatives attended, with 189 observers and guests. Zhao Shilan chaired the meeting. Fourteen representatives spoke. Speakers today included Wu Chaoxiang, political commissar of the Supply Department of the 41st Army, and Li Yuzhen, former female platoon leader of the East River Column. They detailed the arduous tasks undertaken by female staff in the army during combat, including medical services, stretcher-bearing, political guidance, culture, news, reconnaissance, and staff work. They recounted many heroic deeds of killing the enemy, moving the audience deeply. Representatives of ethnic minorities—Suoluogewa from Inner Mongolia, and Hai Tao, a Hui representative—denounced in their speeches to the Congress the extreme suffering inflicted on ethnic minorities by the Kuomintang reactionaries through their chauvinistic policies of Han supremacy! They demanded the punishment of war criminals Ma Hongkui and Ma Bufang, among others. Fan Jun, a representative of students from the Liberated Areas, Cui Junjie, a representative of students from Beiping, and Ge Qiangyue, a representative of students from the Kuomintang-controlled areas, spoke successively, significantly demonstrating how students in the two regions, under different environments, diligently study, participate in construction, and carry out heroic struggles against the oppression of the Kuomintang.
　　Before adjourning at noon, the presidium reported that the preparatory committee of the National Youth Congress invited the National Women's Congress to select three representatives to participate in the preparatory work. The entire body of representatives unanimously approved the nomination of Zhang Yuying from the Northwest, Li Yuzhen from South China, and Ge Qiangyue from the Kuomintang-controlled areas to attend.
　　In the afternoon, the delegations held group meetings to discuss the draft constitution of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation and the proposals of the Congress, and to further discuss the three reports made by Cai Chang, Deng Yingchao, and Li Dequan.
　　[Another Report] This morning (the 1st), the Congress will conduct a report on the proposals, and in the afternoon, summarize the report on the proposals and pass resolutions.
