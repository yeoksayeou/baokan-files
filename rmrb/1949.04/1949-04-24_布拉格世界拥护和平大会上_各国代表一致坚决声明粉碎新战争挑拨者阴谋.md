　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 23rd: The Prague session of the World Congress of Defenders of Peace opened on the 20th, simultaneously with the meeting held in Paris. Representatives from various countries who were denied entry by the French government attended the meeting. The venue was located in the hall of the Czechoslovak National Assembly, where the national flags of the participating representatives were hung. The Speaker of the Czechoslovak National Assembly, Ion, first extended congratulations to the Congress. Then, the member of the Preparatory Committee of the World Congress of Defenders of Peace in Paris, the Czechoslovak writer Derda, announced the opening of the Congress. Derda said: Although we did not attend the Paris Congress, we are in close solidarity with the representatives attending the Peace Congress in Paris. Nothing can prevent us from uniting with these representatives and all peace-loving fighters around the world to oppose the new war instigators. A statement was unanimously adopted at the meeting, stating: The struggle for peace has become the affair of hundreds of millions of people in various countries around the world, and constitutes a powerful movement, under whose banner the majority of mankind is united. The enormous scale of hundreds of millions of people defending peace proves that all plans of the imperialist war-mongers will completely fail. We strongly protest the French government's refusal to issue entry visas to most of the representatives attending the Paris Peace Congress. We will realize the will of the people who delegated us to participate in the World Congress of Defenders of Peace, and in complete agreement with the representatives gathering in Paris today, begin our meeting as an inseparable part of the World Congress of Defenders of Peace. We call on the people of all countries in the world to fight for peace and against the instigators of new wars.
