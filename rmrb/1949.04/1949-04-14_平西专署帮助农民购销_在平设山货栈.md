　　Pingxi Special District Helps Peasants with Purchase and Sale
  　Establishes Mountain Goods Depot in Ping
    [Chahar News] In order to facilitate the farmers in the mountainous areas under its jurisdiction to enter the city to buy and sell goods, and to reduce the extra exploitation suffered by farmers (such as commissions), the Pingxi Special District specifically established the Yumin Mountain Goods Transfer Depot at the Chengzi Railway Station in Mentougou, Beiping on January 12. The depot stipulates that: food will be provided for meals and water for guests who bring grain, and the room fee is ten yuan (Renminbi) per person per night. The depot has livestock troughs and kangs, and provides free hiring of porters and package transportation. Since its opening, it has been highly praised by passing farmers, with an average of seventy or eighty people coming every day. In the past two months, in addition to expenses, the public has provided the staff of the depot with living expenses according to the supply system, and there has been a surplus of several thousand yuan. The Pingxi mountainous area has little land and a large population. Farmers often go to Pingjin and other places with mountain goods (dried and fresh fruits, timber, bristles, etc.) to exchange for food. However, due to inconvenient food and accommodation, and the fact that unscrupulous merchants often coerce and deceive them, farmers are forced to lower prices when selling goods and raise prices when buying goods. In addition, the commission charged by the market is too high (10%), and farmers often sigh and say: "The goods are given away for nothing!"
    [Another News] The Pingxi Special District opened another mountain goods depot at Shijia Hutong, Qianmenwai, Beiping on the 15th of last month. The depot borrowed 100,000 yuan from the Ping Trading Company as a deposit. Since it started business on the 24th of last month, it has sold more than 40,000 jin of mountain goods (walnut kernels, almond kernels, etc.) by the 3rd of this month. The depot also accepts and introduces customers (collecting at the highest market price when purchasing; charging a 3% commission when introducing customers - used for guards, mats, and other expenses). It is estimated that at least 40,000 yuan can be saved for farmers from merchant exploitation. The Beiping Trading Company expressed a very welcome attitude towards the depot and is willing to help each other. It also hopes that the depot can collect a part of the goods, and the company will transfer grain or industrial products to the depot at a price lower than the market price for sale to farmers. Usually, it is the sales agency of the trading company, giving the depot a certain profit. The Pingxi Special District is now planning to add cadres to expand the scope of business and directly contact the production promotion societies of various counties, so that farmers can directly send the goods to the promotion society of their own county, and the promotion society directly sends them to the depot, which will be more convenient for farmers.

　　平西专署帮助农民购销
  　在平设山货栈
    【察哈尔讯】平西专署为便利所辖山地农民入城买卖货物方便，和减轻农民所受之额外（如佣钱）剥削，特于一月十二日在北平门头沟城子车站设裕民山货转运栈。该栈规定：来客如带粮食管做饭，管喝水，每人每夜房钱十元（人民币），栈内有牲口槽、炕，且义务代客雇脚，并代包运。开办至今，甚得过往农民赞扬，每日平均有七、八十人前来。两月来的收入，公家除开支外，按供给制供给了该栈职员的用费，且盈余数千元。按平西山区地少人多，农民常以山货（干鲜果品、木材、猪鬃等）至平津等地换取食粮，但由于食宿不便，且奸商往往从中要胁、欺骗，致农民卖货时被压低价格，买货时又被抬高价格，此外市场所抽佣钱又太高（百分之十），农民常感叹地说：“白送了货！”
    【又讯】平西专署于上月十五日，在北平前门外施家胡同又开设一山货栈。该栈由平贸易公司借来垫本十万元，自上月二十四号开始营业以来，至本月三日已成交山货（核桃仁、杏仁等）四万余斤，该栈也收也代介绍主顾（收时按市面最高价格；介绍主顾时抽百分之三的佣钱——用做看守、席子等费用），估计至低亦可替农民减少商人剥削四万元。北平贸易公司对该栈表示非常欢迎，并愿彼此帮助，并希望该栈能代收一部货物，公司将以粮食或工业产品低于市价转由该栈卖给农民。平时即为贸易公司之代售处，给该栈以一定利润。现平西专署正拟增添干部扩大业务范围，直接与各县生产推进社发生联系，则农民可把货直接送本县推进社，推进社直接送给该栈，这样将更便利于农民。（辛拓）
