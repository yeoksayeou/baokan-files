Beiping Professors and Students
Request the People's Liberation Army to Cross the River Quickly
[This Newspaper's Report] Upon hearing that Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu issued the order of April 21st, Wu Han, a professor at Tsinghua University in Beiping, stated: The order issued by Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu to all the People's Liberation Army fulfills the aspirations of all the Chinese people, because only by thoroughly and completely eliminating all Kuomintang reactionaries who dare to resist can true and lasting peace be obtained and consolidated. Yuan Hanqing, a professor at Peking University, believes: The Kuomintang reactionaries are still stubbornly clinging to their wrong course despite such a peaceful and magnanimous policy of the People's Government. There is no other way but to completely eliminate them. Lei Jieqiong, a professor at Yenching University, said: "In order to achieve true and lasting peace, it is necessary for the People's Liberation Army to move south, and our people should support it." Professor Yan Jingyao said: "Only by quickly uniting all strata of people across the country to support the front line and let the People's Liberation Army cross the river can the revolution be carried through to the end." Professor Weng Dujian believes: The final revised draft of the peace agreement was already very magnanimous, and the Nanjing government's refusal to sign proves that their so-called "peace" is completely deceptive. In order to achieve true peace, the People's Liberation Army should cross the river immediately. Li Guangtian, a professor at Tsinghua University, put forward his own opinion: Support the order of the Chinese People's Revolutionary Military Commission. I hope that the People's Liberation Army will move south immediately, resolutely and decisively eliminate all Kuomintang reactionaries who dare to resist, and liberate all of China. Professor Qian Weichang requested that the People's Liberation Army cross the river immediately, liberate all of China, and achieve true peace. Professor Fei Xiaotong said angrily: "The Nanjing government's rejection of the domestic peace agreement confirms that it has no sincerity for peace. Now, the only option is to cross the river immediately, smash this reactionary force, and liberate all of China." Feng Zhi, a professor at Peking University, solemnly stated that he is willing to support the order of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu with fervent enthusiasm and carry the revolution through to the end.
[This Newspaper's Report] Students and faculty of Peking University, Normal University, Yenching University, Tsinghua University, National Art College, Normal University Women's High School, Huiwen Middle School, Municipal Advanced Technical School, and other universities and secondary schools in Beiping city expressed great indignation at the Nanjing Kuomintang government's rejection of the domestic peace agreement and unanimously and fervently supported the order of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu. Gu Qizong, chairman of the Beiping City Student Union, said: "Since the Nanjing government dares to refuse to sign, our People's Liberation Army should cross the Yangtze River and eliminate all enemies who dare to resist. We hope that the comrades of the People's Liberation Army will fight bravely and strive to be the first to cross the river." When the students of Yenching University heard the news of the order issued by Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, cheers erupted, and the entire campus was filled with the song "March of the People's Liberation Army." After hearing the reading of the order of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, deafening cheers rang out at Tsinghua University, and countless hats were thrown into the sky. The students discussed one after another: This is the greatest order, it represents the hearts of all the Chinese people, it represents the voices of all the Chinese people, and they believe that the People's Liberation Army will definitely fulfill this glorious mission without compromise. He Zhaoli, executive director of the Peking University Student Union, said: "We must study hard and support the front line." The heads of the faculty and staff union and the student union of the National Art College stated: We resolutely support the order of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and we pledge to support the People's Liberation Army with all our strength. The students of Normal University Women's High School even stated: "If the revolutionary situation requires us to go to the front, we will follow the People's Liberation Army to the front!" The representatives of the student unions of Yenching University and Normal University resolutely support the order of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu on behalf of all the students of the two universities and are determined to support the People's Liberation Army with all their strength to liberate the whole country.
