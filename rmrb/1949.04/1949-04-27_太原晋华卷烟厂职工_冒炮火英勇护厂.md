Taiyuan Jinhua Cigarette Factory Workers
　　Bravely Protected the Factory Amidst Shellfire
　　[Taiyuan Electric Dispatch] All the employees of the Jinhua Cigarette Factory outside the South Gate of Taiyuan, in a tense combat environment, spontaneously organized and bravely protected the factory, so that the factory remained intact. At 8:00 a.m. on the 20th, the 83rd Division of the Chiang Kai-shek-Yan Xishan bandits, retreating from the west of the Fen River, forcibly occupied the factory. The bandit soldiers went everywhere with guns searching for things. One bandit soldier searched the boiler room and forcibly tried to turn on the boiler to drink water. At this time, the boiler fire had not been extinguished. Li Shuangxi, a worker in the room, ignored the bandit soldier's bayonet and resolutely went to persuade him. When persuasion failed, he threatened, "If you turn on this valve, it will blow you right out of the room!" The bandit soldier was frightened and ran away. At about 10:00 a.m., under the threat of our army's fierce artillery fire, the bandit army fled north in a panic again. Our army liberated the factory at noon. In the gap between the retreat of the Yan bandits and the arrival of our army, the factory employees estimated that saboteurs might take the opportunity to steal materials, so they spontaneously organized themselves, publicly electing employees Hou Xiaozhi, Jing Chanhou and others as persons in charge. All 68 employees were divided into four groups to patrol around the factory. At about 11:00 a.m., someone quietly entered the factory, opened the glass window, and was about to take something when a worker noticed it and said to him: "Now we are liberated, the whole of Taiyuan belongs to the people, and this factory belongs to us too. You are not allowed to take things randomly." For the three or four days after the liberation, influenced and educated by the good discipline of our army, the morale of the factory employees was extremely high. They unanimously believed that "The factory is our rice bowl, and we must protect it from any damage." After the takeover team arrived at the factory, the employees took the initiative to propose taking out the flavored but uncut tobacco leaves to dry, in order to prevent them from rotting. Although the shells fired by the Yan bandits constantly fell within and around the East Factory, boiler room workers Wang Jinxi and others never left the boiler for a single step. They said, "The factory depends entirely on it (referring to the boiler). If it breaks down, the factory will be finished."

　　太原晋华卷烟厂职工
  　冒炮火英勇护厂
    【太原电】太原南门外晋华卷烟厂全体职工在紧张的战斗环境中，自动组织起来英勇护厂，使该厂得以完好无损。二十日上午八时，从汾河西溃退下来的蒋阎匪八十三师强占了该厂。匪军们持抢到处搜东西，一匪兵搜到锅炉房，强要扭开锅炉喝水，此时锅炉火尚未熄，该房工人李双喜，不顾匪兵刺刀，便坚决去劝说。劝说无效，就吓唬道：“扭开这个口，一下就把你催到房外去了！”匪兵吓得撒腿就跑。十时左右，在我军猛烈炮火威胁下，匪军又狼狈北逃，我军于正午解放该厂。当阎匪溃退、我军尚未到达的空隙中，该厂员工估计可能有破坏分子乘机盗劫物资，便自动组织起来，公推职员侯孝直、荆潺厚等三人为负责人，全体员工六十八人分为四组，环厂巡逻。十一时许，果然有人悄悄走进工厂，打开玻璃窗正要拿东西，工人发觉后就对他说：“现在解放了，整个太原都是人民的了，这厂也是咱们的了，不许乱拿。”解放后三、四天来，在我军良好纪律影响及教育下，该厂员工情绪极高，一致认为：“工厂是咱的饭碗子，一定要保护得没有半点损坏”。接管组到达该厂后，员工主动提出把已经加好香料未切的烟叶，拿出来晒，以免沤坏。虽然阎匪发射的炮弹不断落于东厂厂内及周围，但锅炉房工人王金喜等始终未离开锅炉一步，他们说：“工厂全凭它（指锅炉），假若坏了工厂就完了。”
