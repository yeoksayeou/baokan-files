Gaining Merit in the Campaign to Cross the Yangtze
	Hai Fan

How should I describe the mentality of the soldiers in this southward campaign? I think I should start with the following example:

Liu Dajie, a martyr's family member from a village in Yongqing County, south of Beiping, once gave a report to the soldiers: She said that she came from a poor family, without land or houses. Her husband and brother worked for the landlord all year round, earning barely enough to survive. They had to beg for chaff and dig wild vegetables to get by, living worse than the landlord's dog. Her husband was so heartbroken that he cried several times and ran away to join the Eighth Route Army. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, her husband was discharged and sent back to his village to work because of a leg injury. Her brother also joined the Farmers' Association, and the family was allocated land and a house. Just as the whole family was celebrating liberation, the Kuomintang bandits invaded her village. Not only did the bandits take back the houses and land for the landlord, but they also killed countless poor people. Her brother was beheaded, her husband was buried alive, and her teenage son was conscripted into the army and died of fear after being tortured. ... After recounting this tragic story, she earnestly asked the soldiers to cross the Yangtze River and capture Chiang Kai-shek to avenge her! An angry and impassioned cry immediately erupted below: "Capture Chiang Kai-shek and avenge the millions of Liu Dajies!" "Cross the Yangtze River and liberate the suffering people of Jiangnan!" This solemn oath represented every soldier of the People's Liberation Army, answering the demands of Liu Dajie and all the suffering people.

The hearts of the soldiers are closely linked with the people of Jiangnan. They know that in the vast areas south of the Yangtze River, thousands upon thousands of people are suffering persecution by the Kuomintang bandits just like Liu Dajie. Therefore, when they saw or heard news in the newspapers that the reactionaries were still creating tragedies and massacring people south of the Yangtze River, they were so agitated that they could no longer endure it. They successively submitted requests to their superiors to order the expedition quickly.

Every day, dozens of letters of request are sent from the companies to the military party committee. From these letters, I seem to see the boiling hearts of thousands of soldiers. The comrades of the third machine gun squad of the second company of a certain regiment requested the military party committee with a noble thought: "We are all prepared, and we no longer want to let our class brothers continue to suffer the ravages and oppression of the bandits. We want to rescue them from the fire pit as soon as possible, and enjoy the happy life of democracy and freedom like our old liberated areas. We request the superiors to give us the task of expedition as soon as possible." The comrades of the first platoon of the second company of a certain regiment guaranteed with a strong will, requesting a quick order to go south: "As long as we are given the task of going south, we can endure any hardship." Comrade Yang Xingyi of the third company of this unit has a cold leg. The medical orderly has already packed his luggage, preparing to send him to the rear for recuperation, but he resolutely refused to go. He found the political instructor and said: "I will not go to the rear no matter what. I will crawl to Jiangnan even if I have to. Political Instructor, you said, this is the last advance to liberate all of China. Where else can I find such an opportunity to gain merit?" Although the political instructor still tried to persuade him to recuperate, he insisted on his own opinion: "If you don't believe me, I will make a resolution in front of you, and then write a guarantee after returning to the squad." He only stopped his request after the political instructor agreed.

In order to liberate the people of Jiangnan and to fulfill the task entrusted by history, a high degree of revolutionary heroism is unfolding universally and vigorously throughout the army. Comrade Luo Qingyun, a feeder in the supply department of a certain regiment, is already forty-five years old. His son, Luo Wenkui, is now the deputy squad leader in the anti-aircraft artillery company. A few days ago, he wrote a letter of challenge to his son:

"Comrade Wenkui: Has every comrade in your company made a plan to earn merit? How about our father and son have a competition? I propose the following three conditions: First, resolutely not to fall behind, and to feed the horses well and fatten them. Second, not to violate mass discipline, not to trouble the people, and to help the villagers with their work during the march, sweeping the yard and carrying water. Third, not to complain if there is no house to live in during the march and no food to eat, and to overcome all difficulties. I not only dare to compete with you, but also dare to compete with all the young men in your squad. I want to be an old hero. If you don't believe it, then see you in Jiangnan. ......" The special qualities of the People's Liberation Army are embodied in this simple but heroic letter.

Of course, there are many examples of this heroism. For example, Li Yongtian of the "Mazhuang Company" of a certain regiment ran to the company headquarters to request to deliver the first package of explosives to Jiangnan. Only after the company headquarters agreed did he return to the squad happily. Another example is the "Jiaoxian Company" of a certain regiment. They collectively expressed that they would be the first to plant the glorious flag in Jiangnan, and they were determined to strive for new glory and leave their names forever on the merit book of national liberation. There are also many comrades who asked the branch to test them, educate them, and admit them to the Party in this great march. Many comrades also ran to the company headquarters from time to time to inquire about the merit regulations.

Before leaving, people said goodbye to their elders at home with a feeling of excitement and pride. The following is a letter from Jiang Xueguang, a soldier of the first battalion of the artillery regiment, to his sister: "... Remember how much hope my father placed on me when he was dying, and how much you elder sisters raised me from the age of three to send me to join the army, hoping that I would make more contributions to the people. But in the Jinzhou and Heishan campaigns, as well as when advancing into Guannei, I missed the opportunity and did not realize the wishes of my father and sisters. I am really ashamed. I have now made a great determination to make a great contribution in the advance into Jiangnan. Please wait at home for us to send you the good news when we win in Jiangnan...". Is there any soldier in Chinese history who can compare with our PLA soldiers in their loyalty and joy to their cause?

### 下江南竞赛立功

　　下江南竞赛立功
    海帆
    我怎样来描述战士们这一次南下的心理呢？我觉得，首先应该说一说下面的一个例子：
    北平南面永清县某庄上的烈属刘大嫂，有一次给战士们作了一段报告：她说她是个穷家户，一大家子人没地没房，丈夫和哥哥终年给地主干活，挣不下个钱，她们只得乞讨糟糠和挖野菜对付渡日，生活得不如地主家的一条狗，丈夫伤心得哭了好几回，一气就跑出去参加了八路军。抗战胜利后，丈夫因腿负伤残废，被派回本庄工作，哥哥也参加了农会，家里分到了土地和房子。正当全家欢庆解放的时候，国民党匪帮侵占了她庄。匪帮们替地主要回了房子和土地还不算，而且又杀害了无数穷人，她哥哥被砍死了，丈夫被活埋了，十多岁的儿子被抓去当兵，因被拷打而唬死。……她在哭诉了这一段悲惨的事实后，恳切地要求战士们打过长江去，捉住蒋介石给她报仇！一种愤恨而激昂的唤呼，立刻在下面爆发：“捉住蒋介石，为千万个刘大嫂报仇！”“打过长江去，解放江南受苦的人民！”这一庄严的誓言，代表着每一个人民解放军的战士，答复了刘大嫂和所有受苦受难的人民的要求。
    战士们的心，和江南的人民紧密联系起来了，他们深知在长江以南广大地区里，成千成万的人民，不正是象刘大嫂一样遭受着国民党匪帮的迫害吗？所以当他们在报纸上看到或听到反动派仍在长江以南制造惨案，屠杀人民的消息后，他们激荡得再也不能忍耐了，他们纷纷向上级提出迅速下令出征的请求。
    每天总有数十封请求书自连队送到军党委。从这些书中，我仿佛看到了千万颗战士们沸腾的心。某团二连机枪三班的同志抱着一种崇高的思想向军党委请求：“我们一切都准备好了，我们再也不愿让自己的阶级弟兄继续遭受匪帮的蹂躏和压迫，我们要早日救出他们出火坑，和咱老解放区一样，享受民主自由的幸福生活，我们请求上级早日给我们出征的任务。”某团二连一排的同志则用刚强的意志作保证，请求迅速下令南征：“只要给我们南下的任务，任何艰苦困难我们都能忍受。”该部三连杨兴乙同志有寒腿，卫生员已经收拾好行装，准备送他到后方去休养，但他坚决不去，他找到了指导员说：“我说啥也不去后方，我爬也要爬到江南去，指导员你说，这回是解放全中国的最后一次进军，再到那里去找这样的立功机会呢？”虽然指导员仍是安慰他去休养，但他还是固执自己的意见：“你要是不相信我，我就在你面前下决心，回班以后再写保证书”。他的请求直至指导员答复才甘休。
    为了解放江南人民，为了完成历史所赋予的任务，一种高度的革命英雄主义，正在全军普遍蓬勃地展开着。某团供给处饲养员罗青云同志，今年已经四十五岁了，他的儿子罗文魁，现在战防炮连当副班长，前几天，他给他的儿子写了一封挑战书：
    “文魁同志：你们连里每个同志的立功计划订好了吗？咱们爷俩来比一比好不好？我提出下面三个条件：第一、坚决不掉队，而且把马喂好喂肥。第二、不犯群众纪律，不麻烦老百姓，行军中还要帮助老乡干活，扫院子挑水。第三、行军中没有房子住，吃不上饭也不讲怪话，克服一切困难。我不但敢和你比，也敢和你们全班小伙子比，我要当个老英雄。如果你不信，那就到江南再看。………”人民解放军的特质，在这封朴素而又充满了英雄气概的信中体现出来。
    当然，表现这种英雄气概的例子很多，比如某团“马庄连”的李永田，他跑到连部要求到江南去送第一包炸药，等到连部答复以后，他才兴高采烈的回到班里。又如某团“胶县连”，他们集体表示要把光荣的旗帜首先插到江南去，并且决心争取新的光荣，将他们的名字永留在全国解放的功劳簿上。还有不少同志要求支部在这次大进军中考验他们，教育他们，吸收他们入党，更有不少同志不时跑到连部去讯问立功条例。
    在临行前，人们带着一种兴奋自豪的心情向家中父老告别，下面就是炮团一营战士姜学光给他的姐姐的信“……记得在父亲临死的时候，对我抱着多大的希望，而诸位姐姐们从三岁抚养我成人到送我参军，也希望我为人民多立功劳，可是在锦州和黑山战役里，以及进军关内时，我都错过了良机，没有实现先父和姐姐们的愿望，实在惭愧。我现已下了很大的决心，要在进军江南中立一次大功，请姐姐们在家等着我们在江南胜利的时候，我一定把喜报寄给你们……”。中国历史上有那一个军队的士兵，能比得上我们解放军的战士对于自己的事业如此忠诚和愉快呢？（附图片）
