　　Hebei Agricultural College Relocates Back to Baoding
  　Jizhong Administrative Office Invites Teachers and Students for a Discussion
    [Jizhong Electric] The Jizhong Administrative Office, on the 26th of last month, held a discussion at the Liberation Restaurant in Baoding City, inviting a total of 26 professors, students, and staff members of the Hebei Agricultural College, which had recently moved back from Beiping, to extensively exchange opinions on how to cultivate agricultural talents in the future. Luo Yuchuan, Director of the Jizhong Administrative Office, Deputy Director Dai Jinong, Zhang Kerang, Director of the Agriculture and Forestry Department, and Su Canru, Director of the Jizhong Farm, all attended. Director Luo suggested that the Agricultural College should be combined with the Jizhong Farm in order to achieve the goal of integrating teaching, learning, and practice. The professors, students, and staff members present expressed their support for Director Luo's proposal and put forward many constructive opinions. It is reported that Hebei Agricultural College was founded in the 27th year of the Guangxu reign and has existed for 48 years. Last October, under the threat and deception of the Kuomintang, the college fled to Beiping. After the liberation of Beiping, the North China People's Government helped the college move back to Baoding on March 9th and instructed it to be led by the Jizhong Administrative Office. Currently, the college is divided into three departments: Agronomy, Forestry, and Agricultural and Forestry Engineering. There were originally 18 professors, and four professors have just been hired from Northeast University and Changbai Teachers College, bringing the total to 22. There are 132 students and 38 staff and workers.

　　河北农院迁回保定
  　冀中行署邀该校师生座谈
    【冀中电】冀中行署，于上月二十六日假保定市解放饭店，邀请新由北平迁回的河北农业学院教授、学生、职员等共二十六人举行座谈，对今后如何培养农业人材，广泛交换意见。冀中行署主任罗玉川、副主任戴冀农、农林处长张克让、冀中农场场长苏灿如等均出席参加。罗主任提议农学院要和冀中农场结合起来，以便达到教、学、做合一的目的。到会的教授、学生、职员对罗主任这一提议，均表示拥护，并发表了不少建设性的意见。按河北农学院创立于光绪二十七年，至今已四十八年，该学院于去年十月在国民党的威胁欺骗下逃往北平。北平解放后，华北人民政府在三月九日帮助该学院迁回保定。并指令由冀中行署领导。现该学院共分农艺、森林、农林工程三系。原有教授十八名，刚由东北大学、长白师院聘请了四位教授，共二十二名，学生一百三十二名，职员工友三十八名。
