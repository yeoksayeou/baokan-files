　　During the eight years of the War of Resistance and the three years of the People's Revolutionary War, all our comrades shared weal and woe with the masses, economizing on food and clothing to support the war. Each person's total monthly expenditure was less than a hundred catties of millet. In years of famine, we even ate chaff and vegetable leaves with the masses, and didn't taste meat for months. This spirit of hard struggle was one of the main reasons why we were able to connect with the masses, overcome difficulties, and defeat the enemy. Now that some of our comrades have entered the cities, this simple style has also been brought to the cities, and life is as frugal as before. Today's report that the representatives of the North China Youth League requested a reduction in their living standards and declined banquets fully demonstrates this spirit and the vanguard role of the youth. Our spirit of hard work and simplicity has influenced and changed the habits of some people in the cities who used to live extravagantly, and is playing a great role in changing customs and habits.

　　However, a very small number of comrades, after entering the cities, have forgotten our glorious tradition. They are no longer content with a simple life and demand "improvements" that are inappropriate and impossible. When they fail to achieve their goals, they complain, and some comrades even develop thoughts of luxury and enjoyment. Although this phenomenon is not very serious, it should arouse our vigilance.

　　We are still in a period of revolutionary war, and our army is about to cross the Yangtze River to liberate the people of the whole country. "He who travels a hundred li considers ninety as half the journey." On the eve of this national victory, we should economize even more on food and clothing, clench our teeth, and put all our strength into supporting the front lines. Any negligence, relaxation, or thought of enjoyment will affect our fighting spirit and our support for the war. We have already traveled a long and arduous road, and victory is ahead. We believe that everyone will be able to learn from the example of the representatives of the North China Youth League, overcome and prevent certain phenomena of extravagance and waste, and maintain and carry forward our consistent spirit of simplicity for our lasting happiness, adhering to the spirit of enduring hardship first and enjoying comfort later.

### 发扬艰苦朴素作风

　　发扬艰苦朴素作风
    在八年抗战和三年人民革命战争中，我全体同志与群众同甘苦共患难，节衣缩食，支援战争。每人一月全部花费，总共不到百斤小米。在灾荒年景，更与群众一块吃糠咽菜，数月不知肉味。这种艰苦奋斗的精神，便是我们连系群众，克服困难，战胜敌人的主要原因之一。现在我们一部分同志进城了，这种朴素的作风，也同时带到了城市，生活的刻苦，一如往昔。今天报载华北青年团代表要求降低生活，与谢绝宴会，就充分表现了这种精神与青年们的先锋作用。我们这种刻苦朴素作风，已影响和改变着城市中一部分过去在生活上奢侈的人民底习惯，正起着一种伟大的移风易俗的作用。
    但是，有极少数同志，他们进城之后，忘记了我们过去的光荣传统，他们已不安于朴素的生活，而要求不应有和不可能的“改善”。达不到目的时，就发牢骚，个别同志中甚至滋长了一些奢侈贪图享受的思想。这种现象，虽并不十分严重，应引起我们警惕。
    目前还是革命战争时期，我大军即将横渡长江，以解放全国人民。“行百里者半九十”，在这全国胜利的前夕，我们更应节衣缩食，咬紧牙关，拿出全副力量，以支援前线。任何疏忽松懈和享乐思想，都会影响我们的斗志与对战争的支援。漫长的艰苦的道路我们已经走过来了，胜利已在前面，我们相信：大家一定能够为着我们永久的幸福，本着吃苦在前，享福在后的精神，学习华北青年代表们的榜样，克服和防止某些铺张浪费的现象，保持和发扬我们一惯的朴素作风。
