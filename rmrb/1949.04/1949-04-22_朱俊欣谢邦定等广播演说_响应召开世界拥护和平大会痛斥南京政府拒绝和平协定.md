The original broadcasts of Mr. Zhu Junxin and Mr. Xie Bangding are recorded below:

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
　　Zhu Junxin

    Zhu Junxin, Workers' Leader of the Shanghai French Water and Electricity Company, Standing Committee Member of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions

    Fellow workers and all the people of the nation:

    Today, because the Nanjing reactionary government has openly rejected the peace terms proposed by the Communist Party, which are unanimously supported by the people of the whole country and based on Chairman Mao's eight conditions, Chairman Mao Zedong and Commander-in-Chief Zhu De have issued a military advance order this morning to liberate all of China. We, representing the working class and all manual and mental laborers of the country, firmly support this just order to advance. The Nanjing Kuomintang reactionary government's rejection of this peace agreement is obviously because they are still obeying the orders of American imperialism and the Kuomintang bandit chieftain Chiang Kai-shek, determined to carry on the counter-revolutionary war they launched to the end, and willingly to be enemies of the Chinese people to the end. Therefore, if the Chinese people do not thoroughly overthrow this American imperialist running dog, the Kuomintang reactionary government, and continue to pity this group of vipers, the Chinese people may soon suffer incomparable pain again, greater bloodshed, and greater disasters, and the Chinese nation will forever be reduced to a colony of American imperialism.

    We call on the working class and all the people of the country to unite and support the People's Liberation Army with the greatest effort, to completely and thoroughly annihilate all the troops of the Kuomintang reactionary government who dare to obstruct the advance of the People's Liberation Army.

    We call on the workers in the liberated areas to step up production and support the front lines. The railway workers must ensure transportation, the military industry workers must produce more weapons, artillery shells, and hand grenades, and the workers in all other industries must produce everything that our People's Liberation Army needs.

    We call on the workers in the Kuomintang-controlled areas to protect factory materials and equipment by all means possible, and to cooperate with the People's Liberation Army to liberate the major cities in the south of the Yangtze River by all possible means.

    We believe that under the invincible power of our heroic People's Liberation Army and with the unanimous support of the people of the whole country, the annihilation of the Kuomintang reactionary army is just around the corner, and the national victory of New Democracy will inevitably come quickly.

　　Xie Bangding

    Xie Bangding, Chairman of the All-China Students' Federation

    Fellow countrymen, fellow students across the country: The domestic peace agreement agreed upon by the delegation of the Chinese Communist Party and the delegation of the Nanjing Kuomintang government after a long period of negotiations has been rejected by the Nanjing Kuomintang government.

    We have long believed that the peace conspiracy carried out by the Kuomintang reactionaries is nothing more than a delaying tactic out of fear of the powerful force of the People's Liberation Army, in order to accumulate strength to prepare for a comeback. Their so-called peace has never been sincere. Didn't the Nanjing Massacre on April 1 already point this out with bloody facts? After the eight articles and twenty-four clauses of the CCP delegation were put forward, if the Nanjing reactionary government really had a little bit of repentance towards the people, it should have immediately accepted this lenient condition. However, today, under the instruction of Chiang Kai-shek and his die-hard elements, they finally rejected even this lenient condition. We firmly support the solemn order issued by Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu today to all commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army, demanding that our heroic People's Liberation Army quickly cross the Yangtze River with the force of thunder, capture the bandit chieftain Chiang Kai-shek and his die-hard elements alive, resolutely, thoroughly and completely eliminate the stubborn bandit army, liberate the south of the Yangtze River, and liberate all of China. We, the students of the whole country, will do everything possible to support the People's Liberation Army and complete the victory of the People's Liberation War on a national scale, and avenge the countless compatriots and students who have suffered persecution by the Kuomintang reactionaries for decades.

　　朱俊欣谢邦定等广播演说
    响应召开世界拥护和平大会痛斥南京政府拒绝和平协定
    新华社编者按：中华全国总工会常务委员朱俊欣先生，全国学生联合会主席谢邦定先生，香港达德学院院长陈其瑗先生，民主建国会常务理事章乃器先生，中国文协理事、中华全国文学艺术工作者代表会筹备委员会副主席茅盾先生，前燕京大学圣约翰大学教授沈体兰先生，前复日大学北京大学教授张志让先生等各民主党派及人民团体代表，昨续假北平新华广播电台发表广播演说，响应在巴黎及布拉格召开的世界拥护和平大会，声援我出席该会之代表团，并一致痛斥南京反动政府拒绝国内和平协定。兹先志朱俊欣及谢邦定两先生广播原词如下：
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
　　朱俊欣
    上海法商水电公司工人领袖、中华全国总工会常务委员朱俊欣
    全国工友及全体人民：
    今天由于南京反动政府公然拒绝了共产党所提出的，全国人民一致拥护的，以毛主席八项条件为基础的和平条款，毛泽东主席和朱总司令已在今天上午颁布了为解放全中国而进军的命令。我们代表全国工人阶级及一切体力和脑力劳动者，坚决的拥护这个正义的进军令，南京国民党反动政府，拒绝这个和平协定，显然是因为他们仍然服从美国帝国主义及国民党匪首蒋介石的命令，决心将他们发动的反革命战争进行到底，甘心与中国人民为敌到底，因此，如果中国人民不去澈底打倒这个美帝国主义走狗的国民党反动政府，还去怜惜这批毒蛇，中国人民就在不久将来可能再度身受无可比喻的痛苦，更大的流血，更大的灾难，中华民族将永远沦为美帝国主义的殖民地。
    我们号召全国工人阶级和全体人民团结起来，以最大的努力支援人民解放军，干净彻底全部地歼灭敢于阻挡人民解放军前进的国民党反动政府的一切军队。
    我们号召各解放区的工友们加紧生产，支援前线。各铁路的工友们要保障运输，军工业工友们要多生产武器和炮弹、手榴弹，其他一切产业的工友们要多多生产我们人民解放军所需要的一切东西。
    我们号召国民党区的工友们，要用一切方法保护工厂物资器材，要用一切可能的方法配合人民解放军解放江南各大城市。
    我们相信在我们英勇的人民解放军无坚不摧的威力底下，在全国人民一致拥护与支持之下，国民党反动军队的歼灭是指日可待，新民主主义的全国胜利必然迅速到来。
　　谢邦定
    中华全国学生联合会主席谢邦定
    全国同胞们，全国同学们：中国共产党代表团和南京国民党政府代表团经过长时期的谈判所协定的国内的和平协定，已被南京国民党政府拒绝了。
    我们早就认为：国民党反动派所进行的和平阴谋，只不过是为了恐惧人民解放军强大的威力，而施行的一种缓兵之计，以便积蓄力量作卷土重来之准备。他底所谓和平就一直没有怀着诚意的。四月一日南京惨案，不是已用血淋淋的事实指明了这一点吗？中共代表团的八条二十四款提出以后，如果南京反动政府真的还有一点向人民悔过之心，是应当立刻接受这一宽大条件的。然而，今天，他们在蒋介石及其死党分子指使下、终于连这一宽大条件也拒绝了。我们坚决拥护毛主席朱总司令今天对解放军全体指战员所下的庄严命令，要求我英勇的人民解放军，速即以雷霆万钧之力，渡过长江，活捉匪首蒋介石及其死党分子，对于顽抗匪军予以坚决彻底全部消灭，解放江南，解放全中国，我们全国同学，将尽一切努力，支援人民解放军，完成人民解放战争在全国范围内的胜利，为数十年来受尽国民党反动派们的迫害的无数同胞同学复仇。
