　　Southern Hebei Women Go to the Fields
  　Participate in Major Agricultural Labor
    [Southern Hebei Electric] Since various places called on women to participate in agricultural labor, many women in Southern Hebei who were not accustomed to participating in agricultural labor have gone from their homes to the fields, and the status of women has also increased. In early March, at a village-wide women's conference of more than 300 people held in Huangjinzhuang, Qinghe First District, it was pointed out that women can only improve their social status if they actively produce in the same way as men. It called on women Party members and cadres to take the lead in leading the majority of women to participate in field labor. After the meeting, women in various villages showed their talents and humbly learned how to do farm work. Shi Licheng's wife in Huangjinzhuang helped her husband to make adobe bricks, starting with carrying half a bucket of water, and after a day of training, she was able to carry a full bucket of water. Zhao Xiaojing and his wife delivered manure. At first, Xiaojing's wife only pushed an empty cart, and gradually she was able to push half a cart to a full cart. Shi Xiaocheng's wife learned to plow and harrow the land, and then learned to hold the seed drill when sowing. Huang Huaniang from Jinglong Village, Linzhang Sixth District, had two acres of land when her husband died, and she was allocated another six and a half acres during the land reform. In the past, she thought that women could not do the work in the fields, and she was worried. This spring, after hearing the government's call for women to participate in production, she decided to learn how to do field work. First, she hoeed three acres of wheat, and now she is learning to plow the land. Wang Jintai's mother and wife from Liulinqiao relied on milling flour and other sideline businesses to maintain their lives all year round. This spring, after hearing that the women's association called on women to actively participate in agricultural production, the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law went to the fields to hoe wheat every day. Now they have hoeed the first time and applied top dressing, and are preparing to hoe again after the rain. Yin Xiqiao from Yuanzhuang, Yuanchao Third District, is a primary school teacher in another village, and no one is planting the land. Xiqiao persuaded his wife, Guimei, to do field work. Guimei learned to make adobe bricks, learned to carry water, and heard others praise her, saying, "This woman is really good!" This strengthened her confidence, and she told Xiqiao, "This year I am determined to learn how to do field work, so you can concentrate on teaching." In Huayuan Village, Qinghe Third District, Lu Lanqin did field work and freed up her husband to do business. She plowed 1.9 acres of land in one morning, plowing it fertile and fine. The women in the village were very envious of her and asked to learn from her. Now there are eighteen young women working in the fields.

　　冀南妇女纷纷走向田野
  　参加农业主要劳动
    【冀南电】自从各地号召妇女参加农业劳动后，冀南各地许多一向不惯参加农业劳动的妇女，纷纷由家庭走向田野，妇女地位也随之提高。三月初，清河一区在黄金庄召开的全村三百余人的妇女大会上指出：妇女只有和男人同样的积极生产，才能提高社会地位。号召妇女党员、干部要以身作则带领广大妇女参加田野劳动。会后，各村妇女大显身手，虚心学作庄稼活。黄金庄石立成媳妇帮助丈夫脱坯，开始担半桶水，一天后就锻炼的能担满桶水。赵小镜夫妇二人送粪，开始小镜媳妇只推空车，逐渐能推半车至满车。石小成媳妇学会了耕地、耙地，耧种时又学扶耧。临漳六区井隆村黄花娘，丈夫死去，原有二亩地，土地改革中又分了六亩半，以往认为地里活妇女不能做，光发愁，今春听到政府号召妇女参加生产，她就决心要学作地里活，首先锄了三亩麦子，现在正学犁地。柳林桥王金台的母亲和妻子常年依靠磨面等副业维持生活，今春听说妇女会号召妇女积极参加农业生产，婆媳二人就每天到地里锄麦，现在已锄完头遍又上了追肥，准备下雨后再锄一遍。元朝三区元庄尹西桥，在外村当小学教员，地没人种，西桥劝他媳妇桂美做地里活，桂美学打坯，学担水，又听到别人夸奖她说：“这个妇女真行！”增强了信心，她告诉西桥说：“今年我决心学会地里活，你安心教学吧。”清河三区花园村，吕兰琴做地里活，腾出男人做买卖，她一个上午犁完一亩九分地，犁得又肥又细。该村妇女都很羡慕她，纷纷提出向她学习，现已有十八个青年妇女下地干活。
