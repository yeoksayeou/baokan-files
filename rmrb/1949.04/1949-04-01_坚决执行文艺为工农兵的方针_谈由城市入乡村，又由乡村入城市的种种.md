　　Resolutely Implement the Policy of Literature and Art Serving Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers
    On the Various Journeys From City to Countryside and Back Again
    Xiao San
    From the very beginning of the founding of the Chinese Communist Party, it began to conduct worker movements in cities (and in mines, railways, ports, docks...). "The combination of Marxism and the workers' movement becomes a material force." The initial approach of Chinese Marxists to worker movements was to establish cultural and educational undertakings for workers. From Changxindian to Changsha... workers' literacy schools or workers' night schools were established everywhere. Running schools for workers was a preliminary method of propaganda and organization. In these schools, in addition to literacy and other cultural and political courses, there were also many courses on singing and acting. After the establishment of various labor unions, organizations such as schools, training classes, and clubs became even more numerous (the "Anyuan Workers' Club," a strong force in the Chinese workers' movement—actually the Road and Mine General Trade Union—had a large amount of artistic activities, including military bands and new and old operas, which were regularly performed on the club's stage for hundreds and thousands of employee spectators).
    Cultural and artistic activities played a huge role in the Chinese workers' movement.
    During the First Great Revolution, the Chinese Bolsheviks, led by Comrade Mao Zedong, the representative of the Chinese proletariat, actively carried out peasant movements. Millions of peasant masses in Hunan, Guangdong, Jiangxi, Hubei and other provinces rose up like a "violent storm." This great force promoted the rapid victory of the Northern Expeditionary Army and the general upsurge of the revolutionary movement. Comrade Mao Zedong once said: "If the merits of completing the democratic revolution are divided into ten parts, then the merits of the city and the military account for only three parts, and the merits of the peasants in the rural revolution account for seven parts." "This vast mass of poor peasants is the backbone of the peasant associations, the vanguard in overthrowing feudal forces, and the meritorious officials who have accomplished the revolutionary cause that has not been accomplished for many years" (all quotations are from Comrade Mao Zedong's "Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan").
    After the failure of the Great Revolution, counter-revolutionaries ruled all cities, and the workers' movement was driven underground. Chinese Communists, headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, retreated to the countryside, mobilized the broad masses of peasants, established base areas and people's armed forces—the Red Army—and brought the revolution to a new stage. This land revolution lasted for ten years.
    After the "July 7th" Incident, Japanese invaders launched a large-scale invasion of China. The Chinese Communists still used the vast countryside as their base to mobilize the peasant masses, promote and unite all anti-Japanese classes, strengthen the Eighth Route Army, the New Fourth Army, and the militia to persist in the war of resistance, implement guerrilla tactics, and penetrate deep behind enemy lines. This war of resistance lasted for eight years until the Japanese invaders were defeated.
    After the Japanese surrendered, the Kuomintang reactionary group, relying on American imperialism, launched a counter-revolutionary civil war. The Chinese Communists united and led all revolutionary democrats to carry out the People's Liberation War, initially starting from the countryside, mobilizing the broad masses of peasants, implementing land reform, developing production, and supporting the war. The great People's Liberation Army is invincible and all-conquering. Now, the liberated areas are expanding day by day, and many large, medium, and small cities have been recovered and are being recovered. There is no doubt that the Chinese people's revolutionary war is about to be victorious throughout the country.
    The experience of the past twenty years, especially the experience of the People's Liberation War in the past two and a half years, has proved that the strategy of "encircling the cities from the countryside" of the Chinese revolution's leader—the proletariat and Comrade Mao Zedong—is completely correct and very brilliant.
    The proletariat sent its own troops to the countryside in the past and worked in the countryside for twenty years, and now it has returned to the city.
    In these twenty years, our cultural and artistic work has also been carried out in the countryside and the army. During the Great Revolution, taking Hunan as an example, "Once the forces of the exploiting class in the countryside collapsed, the peasants' cultural movement began." "They ran night schools in a big way, calling them 'Peasant Schools'...on average, each township peasant association has one night school" (see "Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan"). During the land revolution, there was the "Gorky Art School" in the Central Soviet Area, and there were cultural and recreational activities in other Soviet areas and Red Army troops. Even during the 25,000-mile Long March, singing and acting and other promotional work never stopped. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, the new democratic cultural and educational undertakings in the anti-Japanese democratic base areas developed, and there were many winter schools and public-assisted schools and folk art groups in the countryside. Especially since the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art, our literary and art workers have followed Comrade Mao Zedong's literary and art thought and policy—to serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers—and have carried out a lot of literary and art activities in the countryside and the army, and have made a lot of creations and achievements. Writers, poets, artists, and professional troupes generally went to the countryside and joined the army, creating many valuable literary and artistic works about the countryside and the army. Local village opera troupes of the peasants themselves and the army's own troupes were also established everywhere. The popularization movement of literature and art has been greatly developed in the countryside and in the army.
    With the amazing victory of the revolutionary war, we have now entered many cities and will enter many more cities. This part of the proletariat's troops that has been in the countryside for twenty years can now tell the broad masses of the proletariat in the city: Brothers! We are back. The first gift we bring back to the city is to let the proletarian masses in the city know what we have done in the countryside and the army. Our work in these twenty years has not failed the expectations of the urban proletariat. Comrade Mao Zedong, the representative of the proletariat, the Chinese Communist Party, told us that we must all understand the importance of the countryside and realize that our work in the countryside is precisely to liberate the working class and all working people. He told us: Among the 450 million people, 360 million are peasants. If the proletariat does not mobilize and lead this vast mass and make it its ally, the revolution will not be victorious, and the proletariat and all the people will not be liberated. We believed in this truth and acted according to this policy. Now, what can be seen in the art is the peasants who were exploited, bullied, and oppressed under the rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capital, and who have turned themselves over under the rule of new democracy. They are the peasants who are reforming the land, eliminating feudalism, developing production, supporting the front, and joining the army and participating in the war. They are the peasants who have been hungry, poor, miserable, ignorant, and ignorant for thousands of years, but today they are warm, full, happy, active, conscious, and cultured. This peasant mass accounts for seven-tenths of the merits of the rural revolution in the people's liberation struggle. They are truly the pioneers and meritorious officials of the new democratic revolution. The proletariat should warmly welcome this vast ally and continue to unite closely with it in order to completely overthrow imperialism, feudal forces, and bureaucratic capital, and complete the new democratic revolution. Comrade Mao Zedong also told us: "In China, without armed struggle, there would be no status for the proletariat, no status for the people, and no victory for the revolution." Because "the characteristic and also the advantage of the Chinese revolution is that the armed people oppose the armed counter-revolution" (Stalin). Because "the revolution in China, which is mainly agricultural, is characterized by the military development of riots" (Mao Zedong). "Political power comes from the barrel of a gun, and everything comes from the barrel of a gun"—this is truly an experienced saying, so it is the ultimate truth. The people's gun barrel, the people's armed forces, the people's army, the Mao Zedong-style army, is the place where all the best things of the Chinese nation, the Chinese people, the Chinese proletariat, and the Chinese Communist Party are concentrated. There are the most outstanding people, the most strict and disciplined organization, and the most democratic and centralized system. This is the first army in Chinese history that knows why it is fighting, "it is combined and fighting for the just people's war, for the interests of the broad masses of the people, and for the interests of the entire nation" (Mao Zedong: "On the Coalition Government") The army, that is, the people's own army, their own children, so the relationship between officers and soldiers and the relationship between the army and the people are very united and friendly. It is an infinitely heroic army, "with a spirit of courage, it must overwhelm all enemies and never be succumbed by the enemy" (Ibid.). It is an army with great wisdom and mobile and flexible strategies and tactics. In the past, it could fight guerrilla warfare and mobile warfare, and now it can fight positional warfare and assault warfare, especially annihilation warfare. This army is simply a university, a melting pot. When you get there, the backward becomes progressive, the selfish becomes selfless, and all the good qualities, intelligence, and talents of people are expressed and developed there. The often-said deeds of "moving the world and weeping ghosts and gods" or "touching and weeping" appear in this army. Our literary and art workers, in accordance with the policy of serving the soldiers, go to the army to portray its commanders, combatants, political workers, and logistics workers... The personnel of the army themselves are also very good at portraying their own lives, battles, and various characters. (The various fast-talking performances and gun poems made by the soldiers themselves that are popular in the army today are one example).
    What attitude should the urban proletariat and the petty bourgeoisie take towards all these rural and military literature and art? Should we say that it is backward, primitive, or that this kind of literature and art is "not enough to enter the hall of elegance"? We say: No, absolutely not! First, peasants are the vast majority of the people. So-called folk art mainly comes from the peasants. Folk art has always been very rich. The people are not only material, but also great creators of spiritual civilization. All truly great literary and artistic creations are cultivated and influenced by collective folk creations. All truly great writers and poets must draw inspiration from the source of countless profound, diverse, powerful, and wise folk songs (the general meaning of Gorky's words). Secondly, since the proletariat's troops arrived in the countryside, since the revolutionary literary and art workers went deep into the countryside and the army, they learned from the peasants and soldiers, contacted the peasants and soldiers, and jointly created a new art with the peasants and soldiers. This art further develops the inherent advantages of folk art, such as health, liveliness, simplicity, and truthfulness. This is an art that has been improved by an inch on the basis of popularization. This is an art that truly serves the interests of the people and is the people's own art. It is very valuable and worthy of great respect. We must never adopt a master-style contemptuous and high-ranking attitude to treat it.

　　坚决执行文艺为工农兵的方针
    谈由城市入乡村，又由乡村入城市的种种
    萧三
    中国共产党成立之初，就开始在城市里（和在矿山、铁路、港口、码头………）作工人运动。“马克思主义与工人运动一结合，就成为物质的力量”。中国的马克思主义者最初作工人运动的着手方法，就是为工人办文化教育事业。从长辛店到长沙……到处都办了工人补习学校或工人夜校。为工人办学校是宣传与组织工人的初步方法。在这些学校里除识字等文化政治课外，并有许多教唱歌和演戏的。迨各工会成立后，学校、训练班、俱乐部等组织就更多了（作为中国工运一支雄厚力量的“安源工人俱乐部”——实即路矿总工会——更有大量的艺术活动——那里面组织的有军乐队、有新戏、旧戏，经常在俱乐部的舞台上演出，经常有成百成千的职工观众）。
    文化艺术活动在中国工人运动中，起过巨大的作用。
    第一次大革命时期，以中国无产阶级的代表——毛泽东同志为首的中国布尔什维克积极作农民运动，湘粤赣鄂等省的千百万农民群众“暴风骤雨”似的起来了。这一伟大的力量促成了北伐军的迅速胜利和革命运动的普遍高涨。毛泽东同志曾说：“论功行赏，如果把完成民主革命的功绩作十分，则市民及军事的功绩只占三分，农民在乡村革命的功绩要占七分”。“这个贫农大群众，乃农民协会的中坚，打倒封建势力的先锋，成就那多年未曾成就的革命大业的元勋”（引句均见毛泽东同志写的“湖南农民运动考察报告”）。
    大革命失败，反革命统治一切城市，工人运动被打入地下。以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党人退入乡村，发动广大农民群众，建立根据地与人民武装——红军，使革命走上新的阶段。这一土地革命支持了十年。
    “七七”事变，日寇大规模侵略全中国。中国共产党人仍是以广大乡村为根据地，发动农民群众，推动、联合各抗日阶层，加强八路军新四军与民兵坚持抗战，实行游击战术，深入敌后。这一抗日战争支持了八年，直至把日寇打垮。
    日寇投降后，蒋介石国民党反动集团依靠美帝国主义，发动反革命内战。中国共产党人，联合、领导一切革命民主分子，进行人民解放战争，起初仍是从乡村出发，发动广大农民群众，实行土地改革，发展生产，支援战争。伟大的人民解放军战无不胜，攻无不克。到了现在，解放区日益扩大，已经收复了和正在收复着许多大中小城市。毫无疑问，中国人民革命战争眼看就要在全国得到胜利。
    二十年来的经验，特别是两年半来人民解放战争的经验，证明了中国革命的领袖——无产阶级和毛泽东同志“以乡村包围城市”这一战略是完全正确与非常英明的。
    无产阶级过去派遣了自己的队伍下乡，在乡村中工作了二十年，现在又回到了城市。
    在这廿年中，我们的文化艺术工作也在乡村和部队中开展了起来。大革命时代，以湖南为例，“农村里剥削阶级势力一倒，农民的文化运动便开始了”。“他们却大办其夜学，名之曰‘农民学校’……平均每一个乡农民协会有夜学一所”（见“湖南农民运动考察报告”）。土地革命时期，在中央苏区就有了“高尔基艺术学校”，在其他苏区及红军部队中都有文化娱乐活动，甚至在二万五千里长征途中都没有停止过唱歌演戏等鼓动工作。抗日时代，各抗日民主根据地新民主主义文化教育事业发达起来了，乡村中有了许多冬学及民办公助的学校和民间艺术团体。特别是自延安文艺座谈会以来，我们的文艺工作者遵循着毛泽东同志的文艺思想与方针——为工农兵，在乡村及部队中作了不少的文艺活动，有了不少的创造与成绩。作家、诗人、艺术家及职业剧团普遍下乡、入伍，创造了许多有价值的关于农村与部队的文艺作品。地方的——农民自己的村剧团和部队自己的剧团也到处成立起来了。文艺的普及运动在农村中和在部队中得到了大量的发展。
    随着革命战争惊人的胜利，我们现在又进入了许多城市和还要进入许多城市。下乡二十年的无产阶级这部分队伍，现在可以告诉城市中广大的无产阶级群众说：兄弟们！我们回来了。我们回到城市时所带来的第一个礼物，便是让城市无产阶级群众知道，我们在乡村和部队中作了些什么，我们这廿年的工作，没有辜负城市无产阶级的期望。无产阶级的代表——毛泽东同志，中国共产党告诉了我们，要我们全都了解乡村的重要，了解到：我们作农村工作，也就正是为了解放工人阶级和全体劳动人民。他告诉我们：四万万五千万人口中就有三万万六千万是农民，如果无产阶级不发动并领导这个广大的群众，使成为自己的同盟军，革命就无从胜利，无产阶级及全体人民也就不能得到解放。我们信服了这个真理，按照这个方针做了。现在在艺术上所反映的，大家可以看到的，是在帝国主义、封建制度和官僚资本统治下受剥削欺凌压迫，而在新民主主义统治下翻了身的农民，是改革土地、消灭封建、发展生产、支援前线、参军参战的农民，是千百年来饥饿、穷困、悲惨苦痛、无识无知，而今天衣暖、食饱、愉快、积极、有觉悟、有文化的农民。这个农民大众在乡村革命的功绩，要占人民解放斗争功绩的十分之七，他们实在是新民主主义革命的先锋与元勋。无产阶级应该热烈欢迎这个广大的同盟军，继续紧密地和他团结起来，乃能彻底推翻帝国主义、封建势力与官僚资本，完成新民主主义革命。毛泽东同志又告诉我们：“在中国，离开了武装斗争，就没有无产阶级的地位，就没有人民的地位，就没有革命的胜利”。因为“中国革命的特点同时也是优点，是武装的人民反对武装的反革命”（斯大林）。因为“以农业为主要经济的中国的革命，以军事发展暴动，是一种特征”（毛泽东）。“枪杆子底下出政权，出一切”——这真是经验之谈，所以是至理名言。人民的枪杆子，人民的武装，人民的军队，毛泽东式的军队，是中华民族、中国人民、中国无产阶级、中国共产党所有一切最好的东西所集中表现的地方。那里面有最优秀的人物，有最严格最有纪律的组织，有最民主最集中的制度。那是中国有史以来第一个知道为什么而战的军队，“是为着正义的人民战争，为着广大人民群众的利益，为着全民族的利益，而结合，而战斗的”（毛泽东：“论联合政府”）军队，那是人民自己的军队，自己的子弟兵，因而官兵关系与军民关系是非常团结友爱的军队，那是无限英勇，“具有一往无前的精神，它要压倒一切敌人，而决不被敌人所屈服”（同上）的军队。是具有莫大的智慧，机动灵活的战略策略，从前能打游击战，打运动战，现在又能打阵地战、攻坚战，特别是歼灭战的军队。这军队简直是一所大学，是一座熔炉，到了那里面，落后的变为进步的了，自私的成为舍己的了，人的一切优良品质、聪明才智，都在那里面表现出来和得到发展。常言说的“动天地而泣鬼神”或“可歌可泣”的事迹，都在这个军队里面出现。我们文艺工作者遵照着为兵服务的方针，到部队里去，描绘它的指挥员、战斗员、政治工作人员和后方勤务工作人员……部队的这些人员自己，也很会描绘自己的生活、战斗，自己的各种人物。（现今部队中盛行的战士自己作的各种快板、枪杆诗……就是例子之一）。
    城市无产阶级以及小资产阶级，对所有这些农村的和部队的文艺，该采取什么态度呢？该不该说，那是落后的、原始的，或者说，这种文艺是“不足以登大雅之堂”的呢？我们说：不然，绝对不然！第一，农民是人民中的绝大多数。所谓民间艺术，主要是从农民中间来的。民间艺术向来是非常丰富的。人民不仅只是物质的，而且也是精神文明的伟大的创造者。一切真正伟大的文艺创作是由集体的民间创作所培养、薰陶得来的。一切真正伟大的作家、诗人是要从无量深刻、多样、有力和智慧的民间诗歌的泉源里汲取灵感的（高尔基语的大意）。其次，自从无产阶级的队伍到了乡村之后，自从革命的文艺工作者深入农村与部队之后，他们向农民和兵士学习，联系农民与兵士，和农民与兵士共同创造一种新的艺术，这个艺术更加发挥了民间艺术所固有的健康、活泼、朴素、真实等等优点。这是从普及的基础上提高了一寸的艺术。这是切切实实地为人民利益服务和人民自己的艺术。它是很有价值的，值得非常尊重的。我们绝不能采老爷式轻蔑的、高高在上的态度来对待它。
