Jinzhong Dispatch: The Jinzhong Second Special District, including two-thirds of the new district (governing seven districts including Xugou and Jiaocheng), is actively carrying out spring plowing as farmers overcome difficulties with animal power. According to statistics from Qingyuan, Taiyuan, Xugou, Wenshui counties and 29 villages in Jiaocheng, and 22 villages in Fenyang, farmers used the fruits of land reform and loans to pool shares and buy 1,055 head of livestock. At the same time, farmers in various villages actively organized labor exchanges, using people to pull plows and till the land to overcome the difficulty of lacking animal power. More than 50 percent of women participated in agricultural production, performing various tasks such as tilling stubble, raking grass, breaking up soil clods, delivering manure, reclaiming wasteland, and sowing seeds, supplementing the shortage of labor. Among the 114 labor exchange groups in eight villages in Qingyuan County, there were 33 women's labor exchange groups. In Duancun Village, Jiaocheng County, 355 out of 578 women participated in agricultural production. The plowing teams organized by the village consisted of five people per large plow, plowing five mu of land per day; and three people per small plow, plowing three mu of land per day. In many villages in the Fifth District of Fenyang, livestock are organized to plow the first time, and the second time and sowing are done by human pulling. Feng Erni Women's Mutual Aid Team in Wujiapo, Qingyuan County, exchanged labor with men to plow the land. In addition to accumulating a large amount of fertilizer, farmers in various villages are also building water conservancy projects to increase production. The Longwang Canal in Xugou County, which had been in disrepair for many years under the rule of the Yan bandits, had a canal body higher than the ground, and last year more than 6,000 mu of autumn fields in Chu Wang and other villages were flooded. Now the canal has been repaired, not only eliminating the threat of flooding, but also irrigating the land. The county also plans to build another water conservancy project that can irrigate 120,000 mu of land. Farmers in Baozi and other villages in Wenshui County are starting to repair reservoirs and wells that were destroyed during the Yan bandit rule.

    【晋中电】包括三分之二新区的晋中二专，（辖徐沟、交城等七区）农民排除畜力困难县积极进行春耕。据清源、太原、徐沟、文水四县及交城的二十九个村、汾阳的二十二个村的统计，农民用土地改革果实及贷款，集股伙买牲口一千零五十五头。同时，各村农民纷纷组织变工，人拉犁、刨地，以克服畜力困难。妇女百分之五十以上参加了农业生产，进行刨楂、耧草、打土块、送粪、刨荒地、撒籽等各种劳动，补助了劳动力的不足。清源县八个村的一百一十四个变工组中，有三十三个妇女变工组。交城县段村五百七十八个妇女，即有三百五十五人参加农业生产。该村组织的拉犁组，大犁五人一伙，每日耕地五亩；小犁三人一伙，每日耕地三亩。汾阳五区不少村庄，组织牲口犁第一遍地，二遍与播种均由人拉。清源县武家坡冯二妮妇女互助组，和男人换工犁地。此外，各村农民除大量积肥外，并兴修水利增加产量。徐沟县的龙王渠，在阎匪统治下多年失修，渠身高于地面，去年楚王等村被淹秋田六千余亩。现此渠已修复，不仅免除水患，还可浇地。该县并计划另修建能浇地十二万亩的水利工程。文水县的堡子等村农民正着手修复在阎匪统治期间被破坏的水库与水井。
