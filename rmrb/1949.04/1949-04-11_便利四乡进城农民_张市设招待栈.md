　　To Benefit Farmers from Surrounding Villages Entering the City
  　Zhangjiakou City Establishes Lodging House
    [Zhangjiakou Telegram] To facilitate food and lodging for farmers from surrounding villages coming to Zhangjiakou City, the Zhangjiakou City Supply and Marketing Cooperative has established a farmer lodging house. The lodging house officially opened on March 30th. The lodging house has five large livestock pens (capable of holding hundreds of livestock), seven single rooms, and two large heated platforms (capable of accommodating two hundred people). Its business scope includes entrusted agency services, safekeeping, buying and selling introductions, etc., and a "Consultation Office" is set up to help introduce market conditions and answer questions. Farmers inform each other and come to the lodging house to stay. On the first day of opening, sixty-six farmers, thirty-eight carts, and sixty livestock stayed. The next day, it increased to one hundred and two people, and the number of vehicles and livestock also increased. The farmers staying at the lodging house come from counties including Zhangbei, Kangbao, Baoyuan, Shangdu, and Shangyi. The staff of the lodging house warmly welcomes the farmers staying there, and helps them to fairly trade goods that they cannot sell. On the second day, they helped complete two transactions, totaling three hundred bolts of cloth and three shi five dou of wheat. The farmers are very happy and praise the hospitality and care they receive.
