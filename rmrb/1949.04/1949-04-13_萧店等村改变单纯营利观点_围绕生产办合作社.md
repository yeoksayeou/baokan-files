[Jizhong Dispatch] Xiaodian, Xiduan Village, and other villages in Raoyang County, with the support and leadership of state-owned Yudong and Yuhua stores, have shifted from a purely profit-driven perspective. They now conduct business based on the needs of their members, providing essential daily necessities like salt, oil, and matches at low prices. In Xiduan Village, all cooperative matters, whether lending or pricing, are discussed by the members. One hundred and forty households, accounting for 60% of the village's total households, have invested in the cooperative. The cooperative in Beishanwang Village sells white oil to members at 12 yuan (Renminbi) per jin cheaper than the market price. The Xiaodian Village cooperative provides members with alkali noodles and matches at 2 yuan cheaper per jin and pack, respectively, compared to the market price. The Daqi Village cooperative purchased two dou of spring wheat seeds and three dou of pea seeds, all sold to members at the original price. For members facing genuine difficulties, they were allowed to take the seeds first and pay later, or were provided with loans. Military family member Zhang Huanfang lacked seeds for four mu of land and had no way to obtain them, so the village cooperative lent him the funds. Member Liu Sini had an excess of four dou of pea seeds, which the village cooperative helped him sell. The Southwest Minzhuang Village cooperative organized the masses to make farm tools within the cooperative: those with skills worked as craftsmen, receiving six jin of rice per day, while those without skills peeled trees, receiving three jin of rice per day. The finished products were sold to members at low prices; a wooden trough for feeding livestock was more than 100 yuan cheaper than on the market. The Xiaoguanting Village cooperative prepared over 400 jin of peanut seeds, which were sold to members at low prices during planting season. The Yumin Cooperative in Jianhua Village, the Fourth District of Lixian County, in order to help members with spring plowing and sowing, sold 5,900 jin of fertilizer, 3,000 jin of cotton seeds, and over 100 jin of hemp seeds to members at the original price. A few days ago, they also used pewter to exchange for ten head of draught cattle from western Hebei, planning to sell them to members at prices lower than the market.

　　萧店等村改变单纯营利观点
  　围绕生产办合作社
    【冀中电】饶阳萧店、西段村等村合作社，在推进社与国营裕东、裕华商店的支持和领导下，转变了单纯营利观点，做到根据社员需要开展业务，低价供给社员食盐、油、洋火等生活必需品。西段村合作社不论办什么贷、卖多少钱，都经社员讨论。全村有一百四十户入股，占全村总户数的百分之六十。北善旺村社卖给社员白油每斤比市价低十二元（人民币下同）。萧店村社供给社员碱面每斤、洋火每包，比市价贱二元。大齐村社购买春麦种籽二斗，豌豆种籽三斗，都是按原价卖给社员。对实在困难的社员就让他先取种后交款或是贷给。军属张焕房缺四亩地的种籽没有办法，村社就贷给他款。社员刘四妮有多余的四斗豌豆种籽，村社就代他卖了。西南民庄村社组织群众到社内制农具：会手艺的做工，每天六斤米，没手艺的刨树，每天三斤米。做出成品低价卖给社员，一个喂牲口的木槽就比市上贱一百多元。小官亭村社准备的四百多斤花生种籽，在播种时低价卖给社员。蠡县四区建华村裕民合作社，为帮助社员春耕播种，把肥料五千九百斤，棉种三千斤，大麻种一百多斤，都按原价卖给社员。前几天又用锡器从冀西换来耕牛十头，计划低于市价卖给社员。
