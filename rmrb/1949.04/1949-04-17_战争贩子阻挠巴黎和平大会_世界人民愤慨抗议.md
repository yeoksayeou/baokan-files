　　War Mongers Obstruct Paris Peace Congress
  　World People Angrily Protest
    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 15th -- Reports from various sources indicate that the French reactionary government, at the instigation of American imperialism, has limited each country to sending only eight delegates to the World Congress for Peace. This decision has immediately aroused great indignation among the people of many countries. A rally of 150,000 people was held in Prague, Czechoslovakia, on the 13th, and unanimously resolved to firmly protest this action by the French government. The resolution also stated: We clearly know that the growth of the peace camp has frightened the war-mongers, which is why they are obstructing the peace congress. The resolution announced that the Czech people will resolutely fight to defend peace to the end. On the same day, similar mass rallies were held in Bratislava, Brno, and other places. In addition, the organizing committees of the World Peace Congress in Poland, Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary, the United States, Germany, and other countries have successively sent telegrams to the French government expressing their firm protests. In France, this reactionary decision has also aroused widespread anger, and many letters of protest have been submitted to Foreign Minister Schuman. Communist Party members in the French Parliament have raised questions about this issue. The well-known French Communist Party member, Codad, rebuked the French government for restricting the entry of delegates to the peace congress while allowing Americans to enter France freely without any passports.
    Alagon, a member of the World Peace Congress Organizing Committee, declared on the 13th that one of the aims of the congress is to establish a world organization to prevent war and, if necessary, to prevent it through revolutionary action.
    It is worth noting that the French government's obstruction is not limited to restricting the number of delegates. Some French diplomatic missions abroad are deliberately delaying the issuance of passport procedures, attempting to prevent delegates from arriving at the congress in time. The French Consulate in Berlin even demanded that the German delegation, consisting of twenty-two people, submit a list of only twelve people, and then it would "select" eight people from them.

　　战争贩子阻挠巴黎和平大会
  　世界人民愤慨抗议
    【新华社北平十五日电】各方报导，法国反动政府在美帝国主义怂恿下，限制每国只许派遣八名代表出席世界拥护和平大会的决定，立即激起了许多国家人民的极大愤慨。捷京布拉格于十三日举行了十五万人的大会，一致决议坚决抗议法国政府这一行动。决议又称：我们清楚知道，和平阵营力量的增长使战争贩子们胆战心惊，这就是他们何以阻挠和平大会的缘故。决议宣布捷克人民将为保卫和平而坚决奋斗到底。同日，布拉底斯拉发、布尔诺等地亦举行同样的群众大会。此外，波、罗、保、匈、美、德等国的支持世界和平大会的筹委会，都已先后发出向法国政府提出坚决抗议的电报。在法国，这一反动决定也激起了普遍的愤怒，许多抗议书已提交外长舒曼。法共议员已在国民议会中对此问题提出质问，著名的法共党员科达德斥责法政府一面限制和平大会代表的入境，但同时却让美国人不需要任何护照随便进入法国。
    世界拥护和平大会筹委会委员阿拉贡十三日宣称，大会的目的之一是建立一个世界组织，以防止战争，必要时将以革命的行动来防止。
    值得注意的是，法政府的阻挠行为，并不仅仅是限制代表名额。法国某些驻外国的外交机关，正故意的拖延发给护照的手续，企图使赴会的代表们不能及时赶上大会。法国驻柏林领事馆并要求由二十二人组成的德国代表团只提出十二人的名单，并由它来从中“挑选”八人。
