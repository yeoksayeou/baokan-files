　　Pest Control Methods
　　Fire Spider—Also known as Fire Spider Mites, Red Spiders, Red Sand. It often lives on yams, soybeans, cotton, eggplants, wheat seedlings, peanuts, and even grains. This insect reproduces very quickly and spreads far with the wind, causing great harm to crops. Prevention and control methods: (1) Remove all weeds from the field. (2) Mix one pound of white flour with nine pounds of water, and stir it into a thin paste in a pot (use low heat and stir slowly). Then immediately mix it with seventy pounds of cold water. After the paste water has cooled, spray it on the crops with a sprayer. It is best to do this work on a sunny day at noon (the paste water can be replaced with thin porridge). (3) Add four ounces of sulfur powder to one pound of boiling water, stirring while sprinkling to dissolve the sulfur. Then add four ounces of quicklime to another pound of boiling water. When the lime water produces bubbles, immediately mix the two types of water together, stirring quickly to prevent it from forming clumps. Then pour it into eight pounds of cold water and boil for forty to fifty minutes (stirring while boiling). Stop boiling when the water changes from yellow to tea color, but continue stirring to prevent the lime and sulfur from settling. After the water cools, filter out the residue to make an insecticide. Add this to two hundred pounds of clean water and spray on the crops with a sprayer to kill the insects. (4) Using chili water, croton oil water, sulfur fumigation, and other methods can also treat fire spiders.
　　Leaf Beetle—Only the size of a mung bean, it plays dead and is a pest that specializes in eating vegetable leaves and reproduces quickly. Prevention and control methods: (1) Grind one pound of bitter tree bark into powder, then mix it with one pound of wood ash (sieved). In the morning when there is dew, gently shake it onto the leaves with a coarse cloth bag or sieve, until there is a thin layer of white on the leaves. (2) Mix one pound of bitter tree root bark with thirty pounds of water and four ounces of salt, and boil the mixture. Spraying this liquid several times can kill the leaf beetles. (3) "Derris" powder mixed with 200 times water, "DDT" liquid mixed with 500 times water, "DDT" powder mixed with 200 times soapy water, can all kill leaf beetles completely.

　　除虫办法
    火蜘蛛—又名火蛛子、红蜘蛛、红沙，常生在山药、大豆、棉花、茄子、麦苗、花生上，甚至谷子上也有。这种虫生的很快，随风远播他地，对作物为害极大。防治法：（一）要把地里杂草除尽。（二）用一斤白面加九斤水，放在锅里打成稀浆糊（打时要火小慢熬），然后立即再混合七十斤冷水，等到浆糊水凉了，用喷壶喷在作物上。但这工作最好在晴天正午时去做（浆糊水可用稀饭代）。（三）用四两硫磺末，在一斤的开水里随撒随搅，使硫磺都溶化开后，再把生石灰四两也倒在另一斤开水里，当石灰水生气泡时，立即把两种水混合在一起，急急搅拌，使它不成团块，然后再倒在八斤的冷水中，煮四五十分钟之久（随煮随搅），到水由黄色变成茶色时就不煮了，但还要搅动，以免石灰、硫磺沉淀，等到水冷后，把它滤去渣滓就成了杀虫剂，以此再兑上二百斤的清水，用喷壶喷在作物上就可把虫杀死。（四）用辣椒水、巴豆水、硫磺薰等法也可治火蜘蛛。
    猿叶区—只有绿豆样大，会装死，是一种专吃菜叶繁殖很快的害虫。防治法：（一）以苦树皮一斤轧成粉末，再以草木灰一斤（用罗筛过的）混合在一起，在早晨有露水时，用粗布袋或罗轻轻抖在叶子上，等到叶子上微现一层白的就可以了。（二）以苦树根皮一斤，加水三十斤，食盐四两混合泡煮，以此液喷射几次就可把猿叶虫杀死。（三）“地利斯”粉加水二百倍，“的的替”液加水五百倍，“的的替”粉加肥皂液二百倍，这都可杀绝猿叶虫。
