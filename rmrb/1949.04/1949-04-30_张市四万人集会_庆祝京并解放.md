　　Zhangjiakou City 40,000-Strong Rally
  　Celebrates Liberation of Nanjing and Taiyuan
    [Zhangjiakou Dispatch] On the afternoon of the 25th, people from all walks of life in Chahar and Zhangjiakou City held a warm rally to celebrate the liberation of Nanjing and Taiyuan. This was an unprecedented grand event in the history of Zhangjiakou, attended by over 40,000 people. Starting at twelve noon, various groups of people emerged from every corner of Zhangjiakou City. The sound of gongs and drums from the Yangko dance teams mingled with the shouting of slogans; workers, peasants, soldiers, students, office staff, and citizens, young women supporting elderly women, old men holding the hands of children, flowed like a tide from all directions towards the assembly venue at the end of Changqing Road. Forty artillery salutes marked the opening of the rally. At the rally, Comrade Zhang Su, Chairman of Chahar Province, Comrade Su Qisheng, Deputy Political Commissar of the Chahar Military Region, worker representatives Kong Xianlu, Tang Yushan, and Li Weimin, and student representative Liu Shenghu, delivered impromptu speeches one after another. Slogans such as "Capture Chiang Kai-shek alive, capture all war criminals alive," and "Intensify production, intensify work, and fully support the front lines" resounded through the venue, lasting for a long time. The conference adopted a congratulatory telegram to Chairman Mao, Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and all commanders and fighters at the front. After announcing the adjournment, various units spontaneously paraded, and a enthusiastic lantern parade was held at 7:00 p.m.
