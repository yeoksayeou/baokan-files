The Decorative and Realistic Nature of New Year Pictures
    ——A Letter to a Friend on the Review of New Year Pictures
    Wang Chaowen
    You believe that the works in this New Year picture exhibition lack decorative appeal and are not as aesthetically pleasing as the old New Year pictures. If this refers to the lack of organization, messiness, and disarray in the images and colors of individual works, I have no objection. However, if it means that the general works place too much emphasis on the flavor of life, I disagree. On the contrary, I believe that individual works excessively emphasize decorative appeal, making their realism weak. The opinion against focusing solely on content while neglecting form is also correct, but if the so-called form is not for the fuller expression of content, but for the sake of form itself, then it is not a correct proposition.
    One of the important functions of New Year pictures is to carry out revolutionary propaganda and enhance the joyful atmosphere of the New Year. Its formal characteristic lies in the strong decorative appeal. Many New Year pictures are welcomed by the masses because they can absorb this characteristic of old New Year pictures. However, New Year pictures are ultimately not mere patterns and cannot be divorced from the basic task of reflecting real life to educate the masses, nor can they excessively emphasize decorative appeal to obscure the realism of the image.
    Some masses have criticized that "Heroic Couple" lacks the expression of heroic characteristics, leading people to mistake it for a wedding; "Windfall" places too much emphasis on things like gold ingots, which will give the audience the idea that they do not need to work and can enjoy life without worrying about food and clothing; the interior setting of "Celebrating the New Year" does not resemble a peasant family, but rather a landlord or rich peasant family; "Siege Warfare" emphasizes the fire too much, fails to express the essence of the liberation war, and causes the audience to misunderstand that it is destroying the city; "Children Comforting the Troops" have the same eyebrows and eyes, lack individual characteristics, and do not have the appropriate facial expressions; the clothing of the women in "Spinning Cotton" is not that of modern women in the liberated areas, and the labor feelings of the new rural women cannot be seen. It is easy to confuse it with old New Year pictures.... These opinions sharply point out the shortcomings that cannot be ignored. In order to improve the propaganda role of New Year pictures, these shortcomings must be overcome.
    I believe that the reason for these shortcomings is that the authors do not have a good understanding of the combination of the decorative and realistic nature of New Year pictures, and one-sidedly emphasize liveliness, abundance, and vividness, without regard to its realistic basis and the role of educating the audience.
    As New Year pictures, it is not feasible to copy life too simply, even dryly, flatly, and disorganizedly. They must be simpler, brighter, and more lively. Compared with other art forms, it is closer to patterns and should be stylized with a rich sense of rhythm. As for natural forms, it does not have to adhere to the superficial truth, but should emphasize exaggeration and deformation. However, this exaggeration, deformation, and stylization must also obey the basic laws of reality. That is to say, the decorative nature arises from the realistic nature, rather than being added to it. It can only make the complexion of the emancipated rural woman healthier and the color of her clothes brighter and cleaner, but cannot be so beautiful that it is confused with the painted faces and clothes of landlords and rich peasants. Otherwise, it is not a strengthening of characteristics, but a lie that lacks the atmosphere of life. The so-called artistic processing is nothing more than making the beautiful appear more beautiful and the ugly appear uglier, in order to guide the audience to more easily recognize the essential characteristics of reality and obtain an educational effect. New Year pictures that emphasize decorative appeal cannot violate this fundamental principle either. Decorative appeal is based on the strengthening of characteristics, not on arbitrarily embellishing life to cater to certain tastes (pure visual pleasure), making it a distorted image, a non-realistic image. The balance and fullness of composition is a general feature of New Year picture composition, but one cannot only seek balance and fullness and arbitrarily spoil the blank space (in fact, the blank space is also part of the balance and fullness), forcing together and stuffing in some additional things that are irrelevant to the theme, resulting in a surface that is stable and lively, but the central meaning is drowned out by these things. Being beautiful for the sake of being beautiful and lively for the sake of being lively is a kind of formalistic bad tendency that should be criticized.
    The reason for the formalistic tendency of individual works is probably the insufficient grasp of the principle of accepting heritage – how to learn from old New Year pictures critically; at the same time, it is also due to the lack of a clear understanding of the aesthetic standards of the liberated peasants, and the basis for being popular is narrowly interpreted in relatively secondary formal aspects. These issues are worth discussing. We cannot be satisfied with the existing achievements – the general works have basically achieved the transformation of old New Year pictures, not being bound by the old format, creating new New Year pictures, and not neglecting the advantages of old New Year pictures, such as being bright, clean, and harmonious, so that it has become a tool to cooperate with political tasks, reflect real life, and be welcomed by the broad masses and educate the masses – and neglecting that some works still need to overcome the remnants of formalism and dogmatism that hinder the healthier upward growth of new New Year pictures.
    New Year pictures are a style in which decorative appeal occupies an important proportion, but compared to the realistic nature of the image, the interest is really not the most important. For example, what is the fundamental difference between works such as "Transformation of a Loafer" and general paintings? However, due to the positive significance of the theme, the rationality and liveliness of the relationship between the characters, and the distinctness of the character's personality (especially the depth of the back expression of the loafer's wife), it is welcomed by the broad masses. In Yan'an, New Year pictures such as "Battle of Pingxingguan," although sold during the New Year, were not very decorative, but their sales were no less than other new New Year pictures. I am not against New Year pictures emphasizing decorative appeal, but against isolating, unilaterally, and excessively emphasizing decorative appeal. I do not agree with dryly explaining political content and flatly describing phenomena; but I am against completely disregarding the realistic nature of the image and making arbitrary distortions.
    To say it again: the reason why this New Year picture exhibition gives a good impression is not that they are exactly like the format of New Year pictures, but that most of the works have completed the task of reflecting reality and educating the masses. As for one of the shortcomings, it is not that there is too little decorative appeal, but that some works inappropriately emphasize decorative appeal.
    In short, realism is the main thing, and decorative appeal is secondary. Lacking decoration is not very good, but lacking realism is simply unacceptable. What do you say?

### 年画的装饰性与现实性——对于新年画的检讨致友人书

　　年画的装饰性与现实性
    ——对于新年画的检讨致友人书
    王朝闻
    你认为这次年画展的作品，装饰趣味不够，不如旧年画美观，这如果是指个别作品的形象与色彩缺乏组织性、零乱、无杂、我无异议，如果是认为一般的作品太重视生活气味我不赞成。相反的，我认为个别作品过分的强调装饰趣味，而显得现实性的贫弱。反对只重内容，不顾形式的意见也是对的，但所谓形式，如果不是为了更充分的表现内容，而是为形式的形式，就不是正确的主张。
    年画的重要作用之一，是进行革命宣传并增加新年的愉快气氛，其形式的特点，在于装饰趣味的强烈，许多新年画得到群众的欢迎，也由于它能够吸收旧年画这一特点。但是年画到底不是单纯的图案，不能和反映现实生活以教育群众的基本任务游离，不能过分强调装饰趣味而掩盖形象的现实性。
    有些群众指责“夫妻英雄”缺乏英雄之特质的表现，而使人误以为是结婚；“浮财”太着重元宝之类，将引起观众不必劳动，吃穿不成问题的享受观念；“过新年”的内景的陈设不象农民家庭，而象地主富农家庭；“攻城战”太强调大火，没表现出解放战争的本质，引起观众有毁灭城市的误会；“儿童劳军”眉眼一样，缺个性特征，没有应有的面部表情；“纺棉花”的妇女的服饰不是现代的解放区的妇女，看不出新农妇的劳动感情，和旧年画放在一起，很易混淆……。这些意见尖锐的指出了不容忽视的缺点。为了使年画的宣传作用提高一步，必须克服这种缺点。
    产生这种缺点的原因，我以为由于作者没有很好的理解年画的装饰性与现实性的结合问题，片面的强调热闹、丰富、鲜艳，而不顾及它的现实根据和教育观众的作用。
    作为年画，太朴质地甚至干燥地、平板地、无组织地，抄录生活是不行的，要更单纯、明快、活泼。比较别的美术形式，它更接近图案，应当样式化，有丰富的韵律感。对于自然形态来说，他不必拘泥于外表的真实，应该强调夸张变形。但这夸张、变形、样式化，又不能不服从现实的基本规律。就是说，装饰性是从现实性产生出来的，而不是附加上去的。只能够把翻身了的农妇的脸色提高得更健康，衣服的色彩提高的更鲜洁，而不能漂亮到和涂脂抹粉的地主富农脸孔和衣服相混同。不然就不是特点的强化，而是毫无生活气息的说谎。所谓艺术上的加工，无非把美的显得更美，丑的显得更丑，以便引导观众更方便的认识现实之本质特征，获得教育的效果。强调装饰趣味的年画也不能违反这根本原则。装饰趣味，是根据特质加以强化，并不是为了迎合某种趣味（纯视觉的快感）而任意粉饰生活，使之变成歪曲的形象，非现实的形象。构图的均衡饱满是年画构图的一般特点，但不能只求均衡饱满，任意糟践空白（其实空白也是构成均衡饱满的一部分），勉强拚凑、填塞些和主题无关的附加物，以造成表面虽然安定热闹，而中心意义则被这些东西所淹没的结果。为漂亮而漂亮，为热闹而热闹，是一种形式主义的不良倾向，应当批判的倾向。
    个别作品形成形式主义倾向的原因，恐怕是对于接受遗产——如何批判的向旧年画学习——的原则把握不够；同时，也由于对解放了的农民的审美标准缺乏明确认识，把喜闻乐见的根据狭隘的解释在比较次要的形式方面去了。这些问题，是值得讨论的，我们不能满足于现有的成绩——一般作品基本上做到改造旧年画，不受旧格式的束缚，创造新年画，没有忽略旧年画的明快、鲜洁、调和等好处，使他已经成为配合政治任务、反映现实生活，受到广大群众欢迎，并教育了群众——而忽略了某些作品尚须克服障碍新年画更健康的向上成长的形式主义、公式主义的残余。
    年画，是装饰趣味占着重要分量的样式，但比较起形象的现实性来，趣味实在不是最重要的。比如“二流子转变”等等的作品，到底和一般绘画有什么根本的区别呢？然而由于主题的积极意义，人物之间关系的合理和生动，人物性格的鲜明（特别是二流子妻的背面表情的深刻），受到广大群众的欢迎。在延安，象“平型关大战”之类的年画，虽然是过年时出售的，但装饰趣味并不浓厚，他的销路却不亚于别的新年画。我不反对年画强调装饰趣味，但反对孤立地、片面地、过分地强调装饰趣味。我不赞成干燥的说明政治内容，平板的描写现象；但反对根本不顾形象的现实性，作任意的歪曲。
    重说一句：这一次的新年画展所以给人的印象好，不在于它们恰象年画的格式，而在于大多数作品完成了作为反映现实、教育群众的任务。至于缺点之一，不在装饰趣味太少而在某些作品不恰当的强调了装饰趣味。
    总之，现实性是主要的，装饰趣味是次要的。缺乏装饰性不很好，缺乏现实性简直要不得。你说是不是？
