【Taiyue Electric】Meng County has completed the dredging of the Mang River, starting on March 16th and finishing on April 4th. It is estimated that after this construction, 7,000 mu of land in the villages along the river will be spared from flooding. The Mang River runs for fifty li within Meng County. Due to years of neglect and disrepair, the riverbed has become silted up. Last summer, the river breached its banks, submerging more than 7,000 mu of crops in villages such as Dongmeng'an, greatly reducing the harvest. This spring, the masses urgently requested river management, and the government immediately allocated and loaned 600 shi of grain to help overcome various difficulties. The masses were highly motivated, and 4,000 laborers were mobilized and organized from 83 villages. While repairing the riverbanks, they also newly dug a diversion river to reduce the water volume in the main channel. A total of 800 zhang of river embankments were repaired, with a height of five chi and a width of five chi, so that ordinary rainfall will no longer pose a risk of breaching. In addition, a new diversion river was dug in the direction of Wen County, measuring four li in length, 2.2 meters in depth, 4 meters in bottom width, and 8.2 meters in top width. A total of 24,000 workdays were spent. Thus, the long-standing water disaster of the Mang River, which had caused so much "anxiety," will no longer exist.

　　孟县修治蟒河
  　七千亩良田免水患
    【太岳电】孟县修治蟒河，从三月十六日开始，到四月四日已完工。预计这次修筑后，沿河村庄有七千亩土地，可以免除水患。蟒河贯孟县境内五十里，因多年失修，河身淤塞，去夏河水决堤，东孟庵等村，七千多亩庄稼被淹没，大大减少了收成。今春群众迫切要求治河，政府即拨贷粮六百石帮助，克服了各种困难，群众情绪极高，由八十三个村动员组织了四千个民力，一面修筑河堤，一面又新开撤水河一条，减少河槽水量。计共修河堤八百丈，堤高五尺，宽五尺，平常雨量，不至再发生决堤危险。此外，又在向温县的方向，新开成撤水河一条，计长四华里，深二点二公尺，底宽四公尺，上宽八点二公尺。总计费工两万四千个，至此，多年“提心吊胆”的蟒河水患，将不再有。
