　　"○○" Phone Number
    Resumes Service Yesterday
    [Ping City News] The Beiping Telecommunications Bureau announced yesterday: The "○○" phone number (regardless of the bureau, only dialing two ○ characters) is a dedicated facility for reporting emergencies to local public security organs, and it is of great significance for defending the safety of the people. It was temporarily suspended at the beginning of the liberation of the city due to the disbandment of the puppet garrison headquarters. Now, in order to serve the people, the bureau has reached an agreement with the General Corps of the Disciplinary Inspection Team, and starting from the 24th of this month, it will resume service. The bureau has special equipment installed for the "○○" phone number, and all calls made to "○○" can be traced through records. Please be careful not to test dial or misdial to avoid misunderstandings.

　　“○○”号电话
    昨起恢复使用
    【平市讯】北平电信局昨发表：“○○”号电话（不分局别，仅拨叫两个○字）是专为向地方治安机关报告匪警设备，对于防卫人民的安全，具有极大的功效。于本市初解放时，因伪警备部撤消，暂时停办。现该局为服务人民起见，已洽妥纠查总队部，自本月二十四日起，开始恢复使用。该局对于“○○”号电话装有特殊设备，凡叫拨后“○○”，均于记录可以查询。请大家注意不可试拨或误拨以免误会。
