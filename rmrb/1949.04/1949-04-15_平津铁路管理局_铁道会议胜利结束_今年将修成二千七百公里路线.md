    Railway Conference Concludes Successfully
  　2,700 Kilometers of Routes to be Completed This Year
    [This Paper's News] In order to strengthen and improve transportation capacity, ensure military transportation support for the front lines, and complete passenger and freight transportation tasks, the Pingjin Railway Administration convened a conference of transportation section chiefs and station masters on the 12th of this month. Over a hundred people attended, including the Director and section chiefs of the Transportation Department of the Pingjin Railway Administration, as well as station masters, transportation section chiefs, and worker representatives from Tianjin, Zhangjiakou, Tangshan, Qinhuangdao, Nankou, Kangzhuang, Xinhe, and Xingang stations. After three days of discussion and research, it successfully concluded on the afternoon of the 14th. The conference began with a report by Acting Director Zheng of the Transportation Department, explaining the purpose of the conference. Then, Acting Minister Teng Daiyuan of the Ministry of Railways gave a speech. Minister Teng specifically pointed out the significant task of this conference: to complete the restoration of 2,700 kilometers of lines south of Shanhaiguan and north of the Yangtze River this year. After the connection of the Jinpu Railway in March, routes from Beiping and Tianjin to Bengbu, Zhengzhou, Luoyang, and other places have been opened to traffic. In April, it is planned to repair Bengbu to Pukou, Yancheng to Zhumadian, and Xin'anzhen to Baitapu. Then, in May, June, and July, the Tongpu and Jiaoji lines, as well as the Longhai line from Luoyang to Tongguan, will be repaired. In the third phase, the Pinghan line from Baoding to Xinxiang will be repaired. In his report, Minister Teng encouraged everyone to highly develop the spirit of wholeheartedly serving the people, learn humbly, exchange experiences, improve skills, strengthen inspections, understand the situation, eliminate bureaucratic work styles, enhance transportation capacity and dispatch efficiency, shorten travel times, and strive to complete military transportation tasks. In the afternoon, Comrade Liu Yingcai reported on issues such as the future reorganization of transportation stations, business systems, and employee education. On the 13th, the meeting moved into group discussions, and at 3:00 PM on the 14th, Director Guo Hongtao of the Pingjin Railway Administration gave a summary of the conference, pointing out that in order to ensure military transportation and complete the task of transporting one million tons of goods, unified dispatch and unified planning are essential. Director Guo first pointed out that one million and eight thousand tons of freight had been completed in March, with an average of more than 76,000 passengers per day; in April, the daily number reached over 80,000, with a maximum of 90,000. It was also decided to add a special express train directly to Shenyang. In addition, the heavy military transport is the sole central task of the Pingjin Railway Administration, so it is necessary to improve the freight car turnover rate, and accelerate loading, unloading, and coupling. The freight car turnover rate should be reduced from 3.5 to 2.2, so that the task of transporting one million tons of goods and heavy military transport can be completed. The travel speed should be increased from 14.3 kilometers in March to 21-22 kilometers.

　　平津铁路管理局
    铁道会议胜利结束
  　今年将修成二千七百公里路线
    【本报讯】为加强与提高运输能力，保证军事运输支援前线，完成客货运输任务，平津铁路管理局于本月十二日召开各运输段长及站长会议，到会的有平津铁路管理局运输处长各课长及天津、张家口、唐山，秦皇岛、南口、康庄、新河、新港等站站长、运输段长及职工代表共百余人，经过三天的讨论研究，于十四日午后胜利结束。大会首由运输处郑代处长作报告，说明这次会议的目的，继请铁道部滕代远部长讲话，滕部长特别指出这次会议的重大任务，今年拟完成恢复山海关以南、长江以北二千七百公里的线路，三月份津浦路接轨后，由北平、天津至蚌埠、郑州、洛阳等线路均已通车；四月份拟修复蚌埠至浦口、郾城至驻马店、新安镇至白塔铺。然后于五、六、七三月修复同蒲、胶济线及陇海由洛阳至潼关的线路，第三期修复平汉保定至新乡的线路。滕部长于报告中勉励大家必须高度发挥全体员工高度为人民服务的精神，虚心学习，交流经验，提高技术，并加强检查，了解情况，去掉官僚作风，增强运输能力及调度效率，缩短行车时间，努力完成军运任务。午后又由刘英才同志报告了今后运输整理车站、业务制度及职工教育等问题。十三日即转入小组讨论，到十四日午后三时即由平津铁路管理局郭洪涛局长作大会总结，指出：今后为确保军运并完成运输一百万吨货物的任务，必须调度统一，计划统一。郭局长首先指出：三月份已完成一百万零八千吨货运，每天平均乘车旅客达七万六千多人；四月份每天达八万以上，最多有到九万的。并决定增开直达沈阳的特别快车，此外，繁重的军运是平津铁路局唯一的中心任务，因此必须提高货车周转率、装车、卸车、挂车都需加快。将货车周转率由三·五缩小到二·二，这样就能完成一百万吨的货运及繁重的军运任务。旅行速度由三月一四·三公里，应提高到二十一——二十二公里才好。
