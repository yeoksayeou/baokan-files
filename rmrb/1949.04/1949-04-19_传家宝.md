    There was a district cadre named Li Cheng, and his family consisted of three people—a mother, a wife, and himself. He went to the district to work, leaving only his mother and wife at home, but even these two didn't get along very well.

    In the countryside, according to custom, women go back to their parents' home on the second day of the first lunar month. On this day in this year (1949), at breakfast time, Li Cheng's mother started arguing with her daughter-in-law again:

    Li Cheng's mother called her daughter-in-law's name and said, "Jin Gui! Get ready to go! Go early and come back early!" She said this, feeling that her daughter-in-law would definitely think she was very open-minded and considerate. In fact, her open-mindedness was for her own sake: she had a daughter named Xiao'e, who was married to Wangjia Village, five miles away from their village. Because her son-in-law was also a district cadre and was never home, she hadn't had a chance to visit her parents' home all winter. She thought that Xiao'e would definitely come on this day, and wouldn't they, as mother and daughter, have a heart-to-heart talk? Her heart-to-heart talk, besides commenting on her daughter-in-law's shortcomings, didn't seem to include anything else, so she wanted to send her daughter-in-law away early, to avoid any inconvenience when Xiao'e came later.

    Jin Gui was a female labor hero, who sold coal at the market all winter, passing by her parents' home every day. She could go in and visit whenever she wanted, and didn't treat going back to her parents' home as anything rare. If there was nothing going on in the village that day, she could naturally go back to her parents' home for a visit, but on the twenty-ninth day of the twelfth lunar month, the district issued a notice that a cadre meeting would be held in the village on the second day of the first lunar month to arrange for the conclusion of the land reform work. As the chairman of the women's association, she couldn't leave. When she heard her mother-in-law tell her to go back to her parents' home, she could have replied, "I still have to attend a meeting," but she didn't want to answer that way, because she knew that her mother-in-law had a lot of dissatisfaction with her being a cadre. If she answered like that, they would probably start arguing, so she found another reason and replied, "I won't go for now! Aren't we going to entertain guests when they come?"

    Her mother-in-law said, "What guests? Isn't it just Xiao'e? If she comes, wouldn't she know how to cook a meal for herself?"

    Jin Gui said, "Isn't older sister a guest too? Besides, there's also brother-in-law!"

    Her mother-in-law didn't say anything, and Jin Gui went to chop cabbage, preparing for the guests. She chopped a large cabbage, scooped two large dippers of water into the bucket, carried it to the chopping board, and scrubbed the cabbage from the board into the bucket to wash it.

    As soon as Li Cheng's mother saw Jin Gui's actions, she felt displeased: first, she felt that it didn't look like a woman's behavior. She herself had to spread her legs to walk when she lifted an empty bucket with both hands, while Jin Gui could lift a bucket full of water with only one hand; she always used a bowl to scoop water into the pot, while Jin Gui could fill her small pot with one dipper; how could this be like a woman? Second, she washed a cabbage using only one bowl of water, while Jin Gui used almost half a bucket. She felt this was too wasteful. Since she was displeased, she felt she wouldn't be happy without saying a few words, but what should she say? Saying "not like a woman" wouldn't work, she knew Jin Gui wouldn't take that, so she had to use "opposing waste" as a reason to pick on Jin Gui: "Using half a bucket of water for one cabbage? I don't even use that much for a whole meal!"

    "Two dippers of water, what's so valuable? Just carry one more load from the river and we'll have plenty!" Jin Gui also gave her reason.

    "You're right! You're right! Everything I say is wrong!" Li Cheng's mother said these words, looking a little upset.

    Jin Gui saw her mother-in-law pouting and knew that if she said another word, the two of them would start arguing, so she stopped retorting and calmly washed her vegetables.

    Li Cheng's mother had opinions about Jin Gui almost every time they met: she disliked her using too much water for washing vegetables, too much oil for frying tofu, being too heavy-handed when stoking the fire, and splashing water too loudly... She felt that she wouldn't be a proper mother-in-law if she didn't say anything, but if she said too much, she would still get a retort or two. Anyway, she always felt that Jin Gui couldn't be considered a good daughter-in-law. Jin Gui, on the other hand, was very generous. No matter what her mother-in-law said, she would just do her own things according to her original plan. Although she sometimes retorted a word or two, she wasn't very serious about it. She prepared all the vegetables for the guests, washed the furniture that wasn't in the way, splashed water, and swept up the vegetable roots and onion skins on the ground, considering it a busy period.

    After finishing these things, she was just about to tell her mother-in-law that she had to go to the meeting. Suddenly, she felt that something was still not quite right in the house. After a careful look, she realized that it was the broken black box at the head of her mother-in-law's bed. She had suggested moving this broken box under the bed during the big clean-up at the end of the year, but her mother-in-law disagreed, so it remained on the head of the bed. But now it seemed better to move it down—putting a cracked and broken box above a new blanket and new bedding, what kind of decoration was that? She looked at it for a while and discussed it with her mother-in-law, saying, "Mother! Let's move this box down, shall we?"

    Her mother-in-law said, "What business is it of yours?"

    Although her mother-in-law spoke irritably, Jin Gui didn't take it seriously and still said with a smile, "What kind of sight is that, broken and tattered? Aren't you afraid my brother-in-law will laugh? Come on, let's move it!"

    Her mother-in-law was still in a bad mood, saying coldly, "If you have the strength, you move it! I can't move it with you!"

    She fully expected that Jin Gui, no matter how strong she was, wouldn't be able to move it down alone. Unexpectedly, Jin Gui still agreed with a smile, "Okay," and started to drag the box off the edge of the bed, using her chest to press one end down, then holding the waist of the box with both hands and carrying it to the ground, then using her foot to kick the box under the bed.

    Jin Gui exerted herself for a while, and had only taken two breaths when this aroused her mother-in-law's anger. Her mother-in-law said in the tone of shouting commands on the parade ground, "Move it back up for me! That box has been there my whole life! If you're afraid of losing face, you leave! I'm not afraid of losing my face!" Jin Gui saw that her mother-in-law was really angry and was at a loss, only blaming herself for being nosy. Her mother-in-law still insisted that it "must be moved back up."

    Actually, it's not strange. Li Cheng's mother had a deep connection with this box, but Jin Gui simply didn't know it. Li Cheng's mother was a very capable woman, and felt uncomfortable if she didn't have something to do in her hands, no matter spring, summer, autumn, or winter. She had three treasures: a spinning wheel, a sewing basket, and this black box. The things in this box were also very rich, but the variety was very simple—besides the sewing basket, there were only some scraps of cloth. The sewing basket was woven from wicker and lacquered red, but it was a bit old—it was originally part of her mother's dowry when she got married. When she got married, her mother also made it part of her dowry. She doesn't remember which year the bottom wore out, and she used scraps of cloth to paste it up. After that, she patched it when it broke, and patched it when it broke. She doesn't know how many layers of scraps of cloth she pasted on. Now, not only can't she tell what color it is, she can't even see the wicker. Inside, besides needles, thread, rulers, scissors, thimbles, pliers, and the like, there is nothing else. There are also a lot of scraps of cloth, probably twenty or thirty pounds, all bundled up. To those who don't understand, these bundles all look the same, just pieces of scrap cloth, but to Li Cheng's mother, they are not that simple—unwashed ones are rolled up according to the size of the piece; washed ones are rolled up according to their use—that bundle is for mending clothes, that bundle is for making "bei" (meaning using paste to mount the scraps of cloth for making shoes), that bundle is for padding shoe soles, each with its own characteristics and its own markings—some are tied with cloth strips, some are tied with red string, some are tied with thread of various colors, just like the files (official business) in the office that are numbered. The black box that holds these things was originally Li's family's, but no one knows which generation left it—the mortise joints (official name "tenons") are completely broken, holes have been drilled in the corners and edges, and they are tied with hemp rope. The rats have bitten the bottom and edges like saw teeth, and the paint is almost gone, leaving only small pieces of black paint the size of a palm. This box of things, plus a spinning wheel, is all of Li Cheng's mother's belongings. She has lived her whole life guarding these belongings, mending and sewing, and cannot do without them for a day. When Li Cheng's father was alive, she wanted to find a wife for Li Cheng early and pass on this career meticulously, but when Li Cheng's father was alive, the family only had two acres of hillside land, and both father and son were hired laborers outside. The poorer people are, the more expensive it is to arrange a marriage. They simply couldn't afford it. After Li Cheng's father died, the Communist Party came, and she also received land. After a few years, it didn't cost money to arrange a marriage. Li Cheng married Jin Gui without spending any money. At that time, Li Cheng's mother kowtowed to Chairman Mao several times facing west (at that time, Chairman Mao was in Yan'an). In the first nine days (that is, the nine days after the wedding), in order to test her daughter-in-law's needlework, she asked her daughter-in-law to sew her a pair of pants. She thought it was very satisfactory, more meticulous than she could do herself. But after a few months, she discovered that her daughter-in-law liked to follow the children to the fields to work and didn't like to sit at home mending and sewing, and she began to worry a little. She first said to Li Cheng, "Men have men's work, women have women's work..." Li Cheng said, "I think the fields are more important! I myself am the chairman of the village farmers' association and have to miss some work. It's better to have someone helping in the fields." Half a year later, Jin Gui was selected by the village as a labor hero, and then selected as the chairman of the women's association. Li Cheng was also promoted to work in the district by his superiors. The work in the fields was completely handed over to Jin Gui, and the housework was also handed over to Jin Gui. From then on, Jin Gui almost didn't touch a needle for half a year, and she made all the decisions without asking her mother-in-law. This made Li Cheng's mother really pessimistic. When her son was at home, the mother could express her opinions about her daughter-in-law to her son first, without directly launching an attack; when her son left, leaving only the mother and daughter-in-law, the problems slowly emerged—the mother-in-law only wanted to pass down her three treasures, while the daughter-in-law felt that there was no great future in them, and she couldn't make a living even if she accepted them. Therefore, the two people disagreed from then on, and neither could convince the other. As long as you understand this history, you will know why Li Cheng's mother got so angry when Jin Gui moved the box.

    Seeing that her mother-in-law was getting angrier and angrier, Jin Gui didn't want to escalate the situation, so she thought of a way to resolve it, and still said with a smile, "Mother! Don't be angry! If you don't want me to move it down, I'll move it back up for you!" As she said this, she lowered her head and dragged the box out from under the bed again. She was just about to move it up when she suddenly heard a little girl calling in the yard: "Sister-in-law Jin Gui! The office called you to go to the meeting! The district cadres have already arrived!"

  　一
    有个区干部叫李成，全家一共三口人——一个娘，一个老婆，一个他自己。他到区上做工作去，家里只剩下婆媳两个，可是就只这两个人，也有些合不来。
    在乡下，到了阴历正月初二，照例是女人走娘家的时候，在本年（一九四九年）这一天早饭时，李成娘又和媳妇吵起来：
    李成娘叫着媳妇的名字说：“金桂！准备准备走吧！早点去早点回来！”她这么说了，觉着一定能叫媳妇以为自己很开明，会替媳妇打算。其实她这次的开明，还是为她自己打算：她有个女儿叫小娥，嫁到离村五里的王家寨，因为女婿也是个区干部，成天不在家，一冬天也没顾上到娘家来。她想小娥在这一天一定要来，来了母女们还不谈谈心病话？她的心病话，除了评论媳妇的短处好象再没有什么别的，因此便想把媳妇早早推走，免得一会小娥来了说话不方便。
    金桂是个女劳动英雄，一冬天赶集卖煤，成天打娘家门口过来过去，几时想进去看看就进去看看，根本不把走娘家当成件稀罕事。这天要是村里没有事，她自然也可以去娘家走走，偏是年头腊月二十九，区上有通知，要在正月初二这一天派人来村里开干部会，布置结束土改工作，她是个妇联会主席，就不能走开。她听见婆婆说叫她去走娘家，本来可以回答一句“我还要参加开会”，可是她也不想这样回答，因为她知道婆婆对她当干部这个事早就有一大堆不满意，这样一答话，保不定就会吵起来，因此就另找了个理由回答说：“我暂且不去吧！来了客人不招待？”
    婆婆说：“有什么客人？也不过是小娥吧？如来了还不会自己做顿饭吃？”
    金桂说：“姐姐来了也是客人呀？况且还有姐夫啦？”
    婆婆不说什么了，金桂就去切白菜，准备待客用。她切了一棵大白菜，又往水桶里舀了两大瓢水，提到案板跟前，把案板上的菜搓到桶里去洗。
    李成娘一看见金桂这些举动就觉着不顺眼：第一，她觉着不象个女人家的举动。她自己两只手提起个空水桶来，走一步路还得叉开腿，金桂提满桶水的时候也才只用一只手；她一辈子常是用碗往锅里舀水，金桂用的大瓢一瓢就可以添满她的小锅；这怎么象个女人？第二，她洗一棵白菜，只用一碗水，金桂差不多就用半桶，她觉着这也太浪费。既然不顺眼了，不说两句她觉得不痛快，可是该说什么呢？说个“不象女人”吧，她知道金桂一定不吃她的，因此也只好以“反对浪费”为理由，来挑一下金桂的毛病：“说一棵白菜就用半桶水？我做一顿饭也用不了那么多！”
    “两瓢水吧，什么值钱东西？到河里多担一担就都有了！”金桂也提出自己的理由。
    “你有理！你有理！我说的都是错的！”李成娘说了这两句话，气色有点不好。
    金桂见婆婆鼓嘟了嘴，知道自己再说句话，两个人就会吵起来，因此也就不再还口，沉住气洗自己的菜。
    李成娘对金桂的意见差不多是见面就有：嫌她洗菜用的水多，炸豆腐用的油多，通火有些手重，泼水泼得太响……不说好象不够个婆婆派头，说得她太多了还好顶一两句。反正总觉着不能算个好媳妇。金桂倒很大方，不论婆婆说什么？自己只是按原来的计划做自己的事，虽然有时候顶一两句嘴，也不很认真。她把待客用的蔬菜都准备好，洗了占不着的家具，泼了水，扫了地上的菜根葱皮，算是忙了一个段落。
    把这段事情作完了，正想向婆婆说一声她要去开会。忽然觉着房子里总还有点不整齐，仔细一打量，还是婆婆床头多一口破黑箱子。这口破箱子，年头腊月大扫除她就提议放到床下，后来婆婆不同意，就仍放在床头上，可是现在看来，还是搬下去好——新毯子新被褥头上放上个嗤牙裂嘴的破箱子，象个什么摆设？她看了一会，跟婆婆商量说：“娘！咱们还是把这箱子搬下去吧？”
    婆婆说：“那碍你的什么事？”
    婆婆虽然说得带气，金桂却偏不认真，仍然笑着说：“那破破烂烂象个什么样子？你不怕我姐夫来了笑话？来咱们搬了吧！”
    婆婆仍然没好气，冷冰冰地说：“你有气力你搬吧！我跟你搬不动！”
    她满以为不怕金桂有点气力，一个人总搬不下去，不想金桂仍是笑嘻嘻地答应了一声“可以”，就动手把箱子一拖拖出床沿，用胸口把一头压低了，然后双手抱住箱腰抱下地去，站起来一脚又蹬得那箱子溜到床底。
    金桂费了一阵气力，才喘了两口气，谁知道这一下就引起婆婆的老火来？婆婆用操场上喊口令的口气说：“再给我搬上来！我那箱子在那里摆了一辈子了！你怕丢人你走开！我不怕丢我的人！”金桂见婆婆真生了气，弄得摸不着头脑，只怪自己不该多事。婆婆仍是坚持“非搬上来不可”。
    其实也不奇怪。李成娘跟这口箱子的关系很深，只是金桂不知道罢了。李成娘是个很能做活的女人，不论春夏秋冬，手里没做的就觉着不舒服。他有三件宝：一把纺车，一个针线筐和这口黑箱子。这箱子里放的东西也很丰富，不过样数很简单——除了那个针线筐以外，就只有些破布。针线筐是柳条编的，红漆漆过的，可惜旧了一点——原是她娘出嫁时候的陪嫁，到她出嫁时候，她娘又给她作了陪嫁。不记得哪一年磨掉了底，她用破布糊裱起来，以后破了就糊，破了就糊，各色破布不知道糊了多少层，现在不只弄不清是什么颜色，就连柳条也看不出来了，里边除了针、线、尺、剪、顶针、钳子之类，也没有什么别的东西。破布也不少，恐怕就有二三十斤，都是一捆一捆捆起来的。这东西，在不懂得的人看来一捆捆都一样，不过都是些破布片，可是在李成娘看来却不那样简单——没有洗过的，按块子大小卷；洗过的，按用处卷——那一捆叫补衣服，那一捆叫打褙（就是用面糊把破布裱起来叫做鞋用），那一捆叫垫鞋底，各有各的特点，各有各的记号——有用布条捆的，有用红头绳捆的，有用各种颜色线捆的，跟机关里的卷宗（公事）上编得有号码一样。装这些东西的黑箱子，原来就是李家的，可不知道是那一辈子留下来的—＠卯（官名叫“榫子”完全坏了，角角落落都钻上窟窿用麻绳穿着，底上棱上被老鼠咬得跟锯齿一样，漆也快脱落完了，只剩下巴掌大小一片一片的黑片。这一箱里表都在数，再加上一架纺车，就是李成娘的全部家当。她守着这份家当活了一辈子，补补衲衲哪一天离了也不行。当李成爹在的时候，她本想早给李成娶上个媳妇，把这份事业一字一板传下去，可惜李成爹在时，家里只有二亩山坡地，父子两个都在外边当雇汉，人越穷定媳妇越贵，根本打不起这主意。李成爹死后，共产党来了，自己也分得了地，不多几年定媳妇也不要钱了，李成没有花钱就和金桂结了婚，李成娘在这时候，高兴得面朝西给毛主席磕过好几个头（那时候毛主席在延安）。一九里（就是结婚后的九天里），为了考试媳妇的针工，叫媳妇给她缝过一条裤子，她认为很满意，比她自己做得细致，可是过了几个月，发现媳妇爱跟孩子到地里做法，不爱坐在家里补补衲衲，就觉得有点耽心。她先跟李成说：“男人有男人的活，女人有女人的活……”李成说：“我看还是地里要紧！我自己是村里的农会主席，要多误些工，地里有个人帮忙更好。”半年之后，金桂被村里选成劳动英雄，又选成妇联会主席，李成又被上级提拔到区上工作，地里的活完全交给金桂做，家事也交给金桂管，从这以后，金桂差不多半年就没有拈过针，做什么事又都是不问婆婆自己就作了主，这才叫李成娘着实悲观起来。孩子在家的时候，娘对媳妇有意见可以先跟孩子说，不用直接打冲锋；孩子走了只留下婆媳两个，问题就慢慢出来了——婆婆只想拿她的三件宝贝往下传，媳妇觉着那里边没大出息，接受下来也过不成日子，因此两个人从此意见不合，谁也说不服谁。只要明白了这段历史，你就会知道金桂搬了搬箱子，李成娘为什么就会发那么大脾气。
    金桂见婆婆的气越来越大，不愿意把事情扩大了，就想了个开解的办法，仍然笑了笑说：“娘！你不要生气了！你不愿意叫搬下来，我还给你搬上去！”说着低下头去又把箱子从床底拖出来。她正准备往上搬，忽然听得院里有个小女孩叫着：“金桂嫂！公所叫你去开会啦！区干部已经来了！”
