　　Jinpu Railway South Reaches Guzhen
　　Soon Direct Access from Tianjin to Bengbu
    [Tianjin Dispatch on the 1st] The Tianjin to Guzhen (north of Bengbu) section of the Jinpu Railway, which has been cut off for more than three years, has been fully restored after a month of intensive repairs by the Railway Corps of the People's Liberation Army, railway workers, and some civilian laborers. Once the Huai River Railway Bridge is repaired, the line will provide direct access from Tianjin to Bengbu. During the repair process, the soldiers and the civilian laborers along the line worked with great enthusiasm, with the goal of "repairing to the Yangtze River as soon as possible." When a certain detachment of the Railway Corps was repairing the Cang(xian)-Dong(guang) section, they were able to repair six to seven kilometers per day (excluding the roadbed, all newly constructed), breaking the highest speed record for repair under similar circumstances on various lines in the Northeast.

　　津浦路南通固镇
  　不久即可由津直达蚌埠
    【天津一日电】断绝已达三年多的津浦铁路天津至固镇（蚌埠北）段，经人民解放军铁道纵队、铁路工人和一部民工的努力抢修，历时一月，已于上月二十四日全部修复。该线待淮河铁桥修好，即可由天津直通蚌埠。在这段抢修过程中，战士们和沿线的民工们都以“赶紧修到长江边”为目标，劳动热情极高。铁道纵队某支队，在抢修沧（县）东（光）段时，每天能修六公里至七公里（除路基外，均从新建设），打破东北各线，在同样情形下，抢修速度的最高纪录。
