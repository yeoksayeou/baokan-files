[Taiyue Telegraph] Nanciying, Beiciying, Tancun, Dongfeng, Taohe, Hexi, Shangyi and other seven villages in the fourth district of Yangcheng are seizing the season and sowing intensively. In the valleys of Hexi, Taohe, and Tancun, 138 mu have been plowed, and millet and hemp have begun to be sown. In Hexi Village, 29 mu of millet have been sown. Some farmers said, "If we sow earlier, the soil will be cool and the insects won't eat it; the wind is strong in the spring, and the land dries quickly, so we are afraid of missing the sowing season if the land dries up." The plan is to finish sowing by the end of the third month of the lunar calendar. During sowing, Party members and cadres went to the various farmers' association groups to study and formulate production increase plans with the farmers. In addition to mainly increasing grain production, they also planned to increase oil crops according to soil quality and climate. The seven villages plan to plant a total of 3,428 mu of peanuts, hemp, sesame, and flax, accounting for 10.7% of the total cultivated land area. In order to save money for the masses to purchase farm tools, the Shangyi Branch, with the consent of the households who were to receive the harvest, concentrated and sold the silver dollars, pearls, and other items they had received, bought back 117 plows, ＠5 hoe handles, 5 hoes, and 5 manure buckets, and distributed them to each household according to their needs at a fair price. In addition, the branch also mobilized the masses to repair more than 40 old manure buckets. At the same time, the village cadres paid attention to solving the fertilizer difficulties of the revolutionary martyrs' and soldiers' families. The Shangyi Village solved the problem by having the people who cultivated the land or contracted the land for the revolutionary martyrs' and soldiers' families find ways to provide fertilizer for the revolutionary martyrs' and soldiers' families, using manure to offset the number of cultivation workdays, with three loads of composted manure offsetting one workday, one load of pen manure offsetting one workday, and forty catties of collected manure offsetting one workday. Beiciying sold the oil cakes stored by the cooperative to the revolutionary martyrs' and soldiers' families at a low price of two catties of flour per cake, and the wheat will be returned after the summer harvest. This solved some of the fertilizer difficulties of the revolutionary martyrs' and soldiers' families.

　　南次营等七村
  　抓紧季节播种
    【太岳电】阳城第四区南次营、北次营、谭村、董封、陶河、河西、上义等七村，抓紧季节紧张播种。河西、陶河、谭村谷地已犁过一百三十八亩，并已开始种谷，点种大麻。河西村谷已种了二十九亩，有些农民说：“早些种上，土凉虫不吃；春天风头高，地干的快，地干了就怕误了种。”计划阴历三月底种完。下种中，党员、干部分头深入到各农会小组，和农民研究制订了增产计划，除主要增产粮食以外，还看土质气候，有计划地增植油类作物。总计七村共计划种花生、大麻、芝麻、麻等三千四百二十八亩，占耕地总面积百分之十点七。上义支部为使群众购买农具能省钱，商得分得果实户的同意，把分到的银元、珍珠等东西集中出卖了，买回铧一百一十七个，＠五柄，锄五张，粪桶五担，由各家按需要分用，公平付价。另外，支部还动员群众补修了旧粪桶四十多担。同时，各村干部都注意了解决烈、军属的肥料困难。上义村解决的办法是烈、军属沤粪的，由代耕人或包干人给烈、军属设法，用粪折顶代耕工数，每上三担沤粪顶一工，圈粪就担顶一工，拾粪四十斤顶一工。北次营将合作社存的油饼，每个二斤面，低价卖给烈、军属，夏收后再还麦子。这样解决了一部分烈、军属的肥料困难。
