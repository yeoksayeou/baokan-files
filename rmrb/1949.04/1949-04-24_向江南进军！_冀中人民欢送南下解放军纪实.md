Marching South to the Jiangnan!
　　——A True Record of the People of Central Hebei Cheerfully Seeing Off the Southbound People's Liberation Army
　　Central Hebei Branch
　　I.
　　Across the six-hundred-li expanse of the Central Hebei Plain, a magnificent scene of historical advancement is unfolding. The People's Liberation Army, in a vast and heroic procession, is marching south. The people of Central Hebei place all their enthusiasm and all their hopes upon them, and present them with various gifts of comfort. The people and the soldiers, forged into a great force, are forever invincible.
　　Soldiers in new uniforms, sturdy warhorses, tall convoys of supply trucks, and artillery units towed by trucks, tanks, are advancing along the Pinghan Railway, the Jinpu Railway, the Pingda Highway, and countless flat roads, passing through countless archways decorated with pine, cypress, and colorful silk, crossing countless reception stations. Despite the peasants along the way splashing water to clear the dust, they cannot stop the dust that fills the sky, like ocean tides, rolling south, day and night, advancing southward.
　　All the cities, all the villages, workers, farmers, old women, babies who have just learned to speak, all grin widely and shout at the top of their lungs. Yangko dance teams, Shaolin teams, Ba Wang whip dancers, lion dance troupes, large drums pulled by oxen and beaten by eighteen people, welcome the colorful trucks of the People's Liberation Army, cheering and twirling as they swiftly approach the troops.
　　The People's Liberation Army band plays, its golden instruments gleaming, and a majestic march is sung. The students' gongs and drums, huqins, sheng, story-telling bamboo clappers and wooden blocks resound. Songs and cheers echo in the spring sky, shaking the cities and fields.
　　As the troops pass by, the crowds rush forward to greet them, applauding warmly. Those who are welcoming and those who are being welcomed cheer and salute each other, waving and singing incessantly. When the rear guard of a division – who knows whether it is a division or a regiment? – appears, they transform into a welcoming procession, turning around and marching together with the soldiers' strong steps. Children run and jump, and old women with bound feet have to stand on tiptoe and step heel to toe, walking along the pebble-paved roads and the sandy paths, walking, walking. Ahead, the cities and villages again pour out crowds of welcoming people, merging with the welcomed troops.
　　"March to the Jiangnan, liberate all of China!"
　　II.
　　When the People's Liberation Army appeared on the streets of Baoding, the welcoming crowds surrounded the soldiers. The trucks huffed and puffed, unable to move forward despite the revving engines. Workers, students, and women pinned flowers on them and threw cigarettes and candies into the trucks and mess kits. Even though the soldiers were not thirsty, women held out cups of refreshing boiled water to their mouths: "It's dry in the spring, drink more!" The female worker Zhang Sulan was sweating profusely. Elementary school students, seven or eight years old, climbed onto the soldiers' backs from behind, hugging their necks: "Be sure to catch that good-for-nothing Chiang Kai-shek for me!" The soldiers laughed heartily, and one soldier somersaulted an elementary school student and held him in his arms.
　　The impenetrable crowd surrounded the combat hero Xie Laitang, who had received four major merits and one special merit. Chu Zhenjiang, a railway worker who had participated in the "February 7th" strike, grasped his hand tightly: "Comrade, we hope you add merit upon merit. Our railway workers will actively support your operations!" The hero said in a trembling voice filled with emotion: "The people's love is an order. I will certainly add merit upon merit." The military band cheered for this hero, and bright red flowers filled his hat, clothes, backpack, and rifle, reflecting the three shiny medals on his chest.
　　The citizens of Hejian warmly treated the People's Liberation Army who stayed overnight, boiling water for them to soak their feet. The soldiers went to the cinema to watch a movie, while the women at home sewed sock soles for them, tidied up the beds, and then boiled water to wait for them to return and drink.
　　The seventeen-year-old girl Ju Zhenying served a soldier who had caught a cold. She gently massaged his head and forehead, clearing his chest, and took out her own eggs to make a hot soup. After the soldier ate it, she covered him with three quilts to induce sweating.
　　In all the villages, the peasants sprinkled water on the streets and swept them clean. They tidied up their houses, spread their best quilts, and heated the kangs in the rooms that had not been lived in, waiting for the troops to camp.
　　When the troops arrived, the peasants busied themselves. Young men carried rice, pushed vegetables, moved hoes, and carried yellow grass. Children coaxingly took the warhorses led by the soldiers and paraded them around. Young women ran back and forth, their faces flushed, sharply calling out to their partners to sew and wash clothes and shoes for the soldiers. At night, the soldiers and the peasants, mothers holding children, and young girls gathered together like a family reunion. The soldiers told stories of their personal experiences in battle, pointing out the captured American weapons. The peasants told stories of supporting the front lines, turning over the land, and production competitions in the fields. In other villages, grand army-people get-togethers were held to comfort and bid farewell, and to wish for new victories.
　　Along the road of the march, the people enthusiastically presented their gifts. The Renqiu Women's Federation handed over a hundred colorful embroidered comfort bags to the representatives of the troops who saluted them. Xingyuan Village in Shen County carried entire bags and baskets of peanuts and pears to the troops' marching vehicles. Elementary school students took out eggs with poems written on them from their pockets and handed them to the soldiers. One egg read: "My name is Zhu Baozhen. I give you this egg. Whoever comrade eats it, kill more enemies." Several young women from Dong'anwa presented more than thirty pen covers that they had made overnight to the soldiers. They were willing to dedicate these things to the soldiers marching south for the liberation of all of China.
　　III.
　　The road of departure and the road of farewell connect all the cities and villages, connecting the hearts of the People's Liberation Army and all the people of Central Hebei. The farewell-sending people shouted: "I wish the People's Liberation Army good health, a victorious march, and the liberation of all of China!" The soldiers shouted: "Thank you to the people of Central Hebei for your love and support. We will resolutely carry the revolution through to the end!"
　　Comrade Li Meiying, director of the West Street Women's Federation in Jin County, received a letter from the soldiers of the Second Platoon, Second Squad of the × Department on the second day after sending off the troops: "To all comrades of the Jin County Women's Federation, transferred by Chairman Li: Thank you for your enthusiastic hospitality in sewing, washing, and boiling water for us. We sincerely extend our condolences for the fatigue you have accumulated over the past few days. We are now boarding a train and heading straight south, using our victory news to repay your enthusiasm."
　　In Anguo, when the people who were seeing off the People's Liberation Army pinned bright flowers on the soldiers' clothes, the soldiers shouted: "We will bring the flowers of Central Hebei to the Jiangnan, so that such flowers will bloom all over China."

　　向江南进军！
    ——冀中人民欢送南下解放军纪实
    冀中分社
  　一、
    纵横六百里的冀中大平原上，正演出一幕历史进军的伟大场面，人民解放军浩浩荡荡地、英勇地南下了。冀中的人民，把所有的热情、所有的希望寄托给他们，拿各种物品慰劳他们。人民和战士，凝成了一股伟大的力量，这力量是永远无敌的。
    穿着新军装的战士，肥壮的战马，高大的辎重汽车队，和汽车牵引的炮队，坦克，沿着平汉路、津浦路、平大公路，和无数的平坦大道向前行进，穿过无数的松柏红绿彩绸的牌坊，跨过无数的招待站，尽管农民们沿途泼着清水，也挡不住掀起的弥漫天地的风沙，象海洋的潮水，滚滚南流，日以继夜、夜以继日地向南行进。
    所有的城市、所有的农村，工人、农民、老太太、刚会说话的娃娃，都裂开大嘴欢笑，都张圆了喉咙高喊。秧歌队、少林队、霸王鞭、狮子会，用牛拉着的十八个人敲的大鼓，欢迎解放军五光十色的大卡车，迎着部队欢呼着旋转着疾速的驰来。
    部队的发着金光的军乐响了，雄壮的进行曲歌唱了，学生们的锣鼓、胡琴、笙、说大鼓的竹板和板子响了，歌声和欢呼声交响在春天的晴空，震荡着城市和田野。
    部队过来了，人群飞跑着迎上去，热烈地鼓掌，欢迎的和被欢迎的互相欢呼敬礼，不停的挥手，不停的歌唱。当一个师——谁知道他是一个师还是一个团呢？——的后哨出现时，他们变成了欢迎的行列，转过头来，跟着战士们的骄健步伐一齐行进，孩子们连跑带跳，裹脚的老太太，不得不竖起脚尖紧踩着脚跟走着，沿着石子铺过的路，细砂布满的路走着，走着。前面的城市，前面的乡村，黑压压地又拥出欢迎的人群，和被欢迎的大队汇合了。
    “向江南进军，解放全中国！”
    二、
    解放军出现在保定街头时，欢迎的人群把战士们围拢了起来，汽车唿唿的发喘，光响着马达开不过去了。工人、学生、妇女们给他们插着鲜花，向汽车上、行军锅里投掷着纸烟、糖果，尽管战士们不渴，女人们也端着可口的开水，举到战士们的嘴上：“春天干燥，多喝点！”女工张素兰忙了个满头大汗；七八岁的小学生从战士们的背后爬到身上去，搂着战士们的脖子“可给我捉着蒋介石那个孬种呵！”战士们哈哈大笑了，战士把小学生翻了个筋斗，抱在怀里。
    风雨不透的人群，围着立过四次大功、一次特功的战斗英雄谢来堂，参加过“二七”罢工的铁路工人楚镇江，紧握着他的手：“同志，希望你功上加功，我们铁路工人积极支援你们作战！”这位英雄激动着发颤的声音说：“人民的爱戴，就是命令，我一定功上加功。”军乐队欢送着这位英雄，红艳的花朵插满了他的帽子衣服背包和步枪上，映红了他胸前发亮的三颗奖章。
    河间的市民们，亲切的招待着住宿的解放军，给他们烧了水烫了脚，战士们到电影院看电影去了，妇女们在家里给他们缝着袜底，收拾好床铺，然后烧了开水等他们回来喝。
    十七岁的少女鞠振英，服侍着害伤风的战士，他用手轻轻的捏着他的头额，输通着他的心胸，拿出自己的鸡蛋，作了热汤，战士吃了之后，给他盖上三条被子发汗。
    所有的乡村里，农民把街道用水泼了，打扫的干干净净，把房子收拾好了，铺上他们最好的被子，在没有住过人的屋里烧着炕，等候着部队的宿营。
    部队来了，农民们忙乱起来了，年青的男人们扛米、推菜、搬锄刀、背黄草，孩子们发娇的把战士们牵着的战马接过来遛着，年青的妇女们奔跑着，涨红了脸，尖锐的招呼着伙伴，给战士们缝洗着衣服鞋子。夜里，战士和农民们、抱着孩子的妈妈、年青的姑娘，俨如一家人的团聚，战士们讲着亲身经历的战斗故事，指点着缴获的美国武器，农民们讲着支援前线、翻身和田间生产竞赛的情景。另外的一些村庄，开着盛大的军民联欢会，慰问告别，预祝着新的胜利。
    进军所走过的道路，人民热情的馈赠着自己的礼物，任邱妇联会把一百个五彩绣花的慰问袋递给了给她们敬礼的部队代表。深县杏园村把整袋整筐的花生、梨抬到部队的行军车上，小学生从口袋里掏出写着诗的鸡蛋，递给战士，一个鸡蛋上写着：“我叫朱宝珍，鸡蛋送给您，那个同志吃了它，多多杀敌人。”东安洼几个青年妇女把一夜没睡觉结成的三十多个钢笔套送给了战士，他们愿意把这些东西，供献给为解放全中国而南征的战士。
    三、
    出征的路，送行的路，连结着所有的城市和乡村，连结着人民解放军与所有冀中人民的心，送行人民高呼：“祝解放军身体健康，胜利进军解放全中国！”战士们高呼：“答谢冀中人民对我们的爱戴，坚决将革命进行到底！”
    晋县西大街妇联会主任李美英同志，于送走部队的第二天接到×部二连二班战士们的来信：“晋县妇联会李会长转全体同志：感谢你对我们的缝洗烧水的热心招待，衷心的慰问你们数日来所积累下的疲劳；我们现在已搭乘火车，直驱南下，用我们的胜利消息来报答你们的热情。”
    在安国，当欢送解放军的人民把鲜艳的花朵插到战士们的衣服上时，战士们高呼：“我们要把冀中的鲜花带到江南去，使全中国都开遍这样的鲜花。”
