　　Comrade Kang Keqing Calls for Emphasis on Children's Nursery Work at the Women's Congress
　　[Report from this newspaper] Comrade Kang Keqing made a speech on children's nursery work at the National Women's Congress. She first expressed her complete agreement with the reports of Comrades Cai Chang, Deng Yingchao, and Mr. Li Dequan. In her speech, she emphasized that the children's nursery work in the liberated areas was developed in backward rural areas and frequent war environments, overcoming countless difficulties. The People's Government has made great efforts to improve children's lives, promote maternal and child health and nursery work, open midwifery training classes, transform old midwives, organize Chinese and Western medicine cooperatives, and send mobile medical teams to work in rural areas.
　　After the land reform, the broad masses of laboring farmers turned themselves over and actively responded to Chairman Mao's call for both prosperity of people and wealth, striving for production, to achieve adequate food and clothing, and raise more children. Many women traveled far to hospitals for treatment, according to statistics from the North China Harrison Hospital, 100 percent of women treated for gynecological diseases were seeking to have children. This contrasted with the widespread phenomena of abortion and infanticide in the Kuomintang-controlled areas, illustrating two different societies. However, due to insufficient medical conditions and medical personnel in the liberated areas, the widespread problems of maternal and child diseases could not yet be fully resolved.
　　Nursery institutions in various liberated areas are gradually expanding, overcoming difficulties
　　She said: There are now ninety nurseries and daycare centers in various liberated areas, which have been established and expanded by constantly overcoming various difficulties. Comrades in nursery work have personally built cave dwellings, repaired houses, utensils, raised pigs, and grown vegetables to improve facilities and increase children's nutrition; emphasized prevention and disease isolation to compensate for the lack of medical conditions; when children were sick, nursery workers took care of them day and night, and gave blood transfusions to children. In the past, the First Nursery had more than two hundred children. Once, a measles epidemic suddenly broke out, and eighty-four children fell ill at once. Comrades in nursery work quickly isolated the sick children and took care of them wholeheartedly. As a result, not a single child died. The Los Angeles Daycare Center has not had a child die from illness in several years, which surprised international friends who came to visit. When the enemy attacked or "mopped up," the nursery institutions had to evacuate with the children. A daycare center in Shandong moved nine times. When Yan'an was attacked by Hu bandits, enemy planes indiscriminately bombed and strafed, and nursery workers used their bodies to protect the children. They said, "Kill me first, don't kill the children." These all illustrate the hard-working style of the comrades in nursery work in the liberated areas and their high sense of responsibility for children's nursery work. Now that the nursery institutions in the liberated areas have achieved initial success, we should thank the support of the People's Government and the efforts of the comrades in nursery work, and we should also thank the help of friends at home and abroad, such as Ms. Soong Ching Ling.
　　In the future, all institutions and factories should universally set up daytime daycare centers
　　As for future nursery work, we should (1) establish daytime daycare centers in factories and institutions, jointly run by the factories and trade unions, with the children's mothers assisting. (2) Set up full-time nurseries under possible conditions to absorb the orphans of martyrs and children whose parents are far away or whose mothers are heavily burdened with work. (3) Mothers help each other to change work and take care of children, which is simple and easy to do and can be promoted everywhere. (4) Continue to promote maternal and child health work. (5) Find ways to relieve and settle orphans and child refugees. Finally, we should regard nursery work as a glorious task. Female comrades! Especially mothers, let us dedicate ourselves to this nursery work! I hope that comrades in all positions will contribute your wisdom and strength to the children, and I hope that democratic friends at home and abroad will continue to provide assistance, so that we can work together to cultivate the new generation!

### 康克清同志在妇代会上号召重视儿童保育事业

　　康克清同志在妇代会上
  　号召重视儿童保育事业
    【本报讯】康克清同志在全国妇女代表大会上作了关于儿童保育工作的发言。她首先表示完全同意蔡畅同志、邓颖超同志及李德全先生的报告。在她发言中着重地说明解放区的儿童保育工作是在落后的农村与战争频繁的环境中，克服了无数困难而发展起来的。人民政府曾以大力来改善儿童生活，推进妇婴卫生与保育事业，开办接生训练班，改造旧接生婆，组织中西医合作社，巡回医疗队深入农村工作。
    土地改革以后，广大劳动农民翻了身，积极响应毛主席人财两旺的号召，努力生产，要做到丰衣足食，多养孩子。许多妇女从老远跑到医院去治病，据华北哈里逊医院的统计，治妇科病的妇女百分之百是为了要求生孩子。这与国民党统治区普遍的打胎溺婴现象对照，说明两个不同的社会。但是解放区由于医药条件与医卫人员尚不够，还不能全部解决普遍存在的妇婴疾病问题。
  　各解放区保育机关克服困难日渐扩大
    她说：各解放区现已有了保育院托儿所九十所，这些保育院托儿所是在不断地克服了各种困难而创立和扩大起来的。保育工作同志曾亲自动手打窑洞、修房屋、用具、养猪、种菜以改善设备与增加孩子的营养；强调预防与疾病隔离以补救医药条件之不足，孩子有病时，保育员同志日夜看护，以及为孩子输血。第一保育院过去有二百多孩子，有一次突然发生麻疹传染病，一下子八十四个孩子都病倒了，保育工作同志迅速地把病孩隔离开，尽心护理，结果一个孩子也没有死亡。洛杉机托儿所几年来没有病死过一个孩子，曾经引起前来参观的国际友人的惊异。当敌人进攻或“扫荡”时，保育机关不得不带着孩子疏散。山东一个托儿所，曾搬了九次家。延安被胡匪进攻时，敌机滥炸扫射，保育员以自己身体掩护孩子，她们说：“要打死先打死我，不要打死孩子。”这些都说明解放区保育工作同志的艰苦工作作风与对儿童保育事业的高度责任心。现在解放区保育机关得有初步成就，应感谢人民政府的支持与保育工作同志的努力，并应感谢国内外友人的帮助，如宋庆龄先生等。
   今后各机关和工厂应普设日间托儿所
    至于今后的保育工作，应该（一）在工厂机关设立日间托儿所，由厂方与工会合办，孩子的妈妈协助。（二）在可能条件下办完全托儿所，吸收烈士遗孤及父母远离或母亲工作繁重的孩子。（三）母亲们互助变工带孩子，简而易办，各地均可推行。（四）继续推广妇婴卫生工作。（五）设法救济与安置孤儿难童。最后我们应把保育事业看成光荣的任务。女同志！特别是母亲，大家来献身于这保育事业！希望各个岗位上的男女同志为孩子们贡献你们的智慧与力量，希望国内外民主友人继续给以援助，让我们为培养新一代而共同努力！
