　　Nonglin No. 4 Sweet Potato—A type of sweet potato, also known as foreign yam. It was cultivated by the Kanto Agricultural Experiment Station in Japan. After testing and research by our Shijiazhuang Farm, it is considered a superior variety.

　　Characteristics of this sweet potato: The vines are semi-prostrate, the stems are thicker than ordinary sweet potato stems, the stems are one and a half to two and a half feet long, with four to five branches, the petioles are also longer, the leaves resemble horseshoes, there is a red boundary between the leaf and the petiole, the sweet potato tubers are red inside and out, uniform in size, and the tubers are tightly clustered together.

　　Advantages: 1. High yield: Each mu can yield 4,500 to 5,000 jin, and even in wheat stubble fields, it can yield 3,000 to 3,500 jin, which is 70% more than local yams. 2. Easy to dig. 3. Seedlings are resistant to wind and drought, and do not easily wither. Because they contain a peculiar smell, they can reduce the damage from mole crickets and other pests, maintaining full stands. 4. The sweet potato tubers have less fiber and more starch (most suitable for making vermicelli). 5. The sweet potato vines are no more than three feet long and do not grow small roots, so they only need to be turned two or three times during planting, which saves labor. 6. Short growing period (can be planted during the period of May to July in the solar calendar).

　　Disadvantages: Low sugar content, not sweet. High moisture content, very easily spoiled.

　　Cultivation method: A row spacing of two feet and a plant spacing of one and a half feet is best, and early planting is most suitable.

　　Promotion Society—A specialized agency that leads and promotes agricultural and handicraft production. Its main businesses are: (1) Handling loans and grain lending for agricultural and handicraft production. (2) Engaging in supply and marketing operations, directly supplying industrial products to the masses for consumption at prices lower than market prices, eliminating the intermediary exploitation of merchants, and purchasing the masses' products at prices slightly higher than market prices. (3) Organizing mass production and solving the difficulties of the masses in production and life necessities. (4) Helping the masses organize production cooperatives.

　　Sprayer—A tool for killing pests in agriculture, shaped like an air cylinder. It contains liquid medicine, and uses air pressure to spray out through the small holes on the sprayer, sprinkling it on the leaves or stems of plants.

　　CC—A transliteration of the English CC. A unit of liquid volume, meaning cubic centimeter, one one-hundredth of a meter.

　　S Cotton 2B (formerly Stone Vorr)—A type of American cotton. The leaves are dark green when young, and purple or brown when old. The whole plant is shaped like a pagoda. Other advantages are the same as S Cotton (No. 4).
