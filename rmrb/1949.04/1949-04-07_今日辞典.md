    Measles—an acute infectious disease, commonly known as疹子 (zhěn zi - rash). Initially, there are symptoms of chills and fever, hoarse cough, sneezing, and tearing. In severe cases, the mucous membrane of the nasopharynx becomes inflamed. After four or five days, red rashes first appear on the face, gradually spreading throughout the body. It mostly affects children.
    Worker-Peasant Alliance—Lenin, in his book "What is to be done?", first put forward the idea that the worker-peasant revolutionary alliance is the road to victory for the proletariat's struggle. The worker-peasant revolutionary alliance is a proven truth: that in countries where peasants are the main population, the proletariat must win over the broad masses of peasants as their allies in order to lead the revolution (whether it is a bourgeois democratic revolution or a socialist revolution) to victory; at the same time, peasants can only achieve true victory and ultimately liberate themselves under the leadership of the proletariat.
    Train—When a train is moving, the locomotive pulls passenger cars and freight cars in a long line, which is called a train.
    Shunting—When a train arrives at a station, and it is desired to leave one or more cars behind, the train is driven onto a track switch (turnout), the cars to be left behind are shunted off, and then the locomotive continues on its way. This process is called shunting.

    工农联盟—列宁在其“什么是‘人民之友’”一书里，第一次提出了关于工农革命联盟是无产阶级斗争走向胜利底道路的思想。工农革命联盟是已经证明了的真理：即以农民为主的国家，无产阶级必须争取广大农民群众作为自己的同盟者，才能领导革命（无论是资产阶级民主革命或是社会主义革命）走向胜利；同时农民也只有在无产阶级领导下，才能得到真正的胜利，达到最后解放自己的目的。
