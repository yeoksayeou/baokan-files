　　Tangshan Machine Factory Rushes Production
  　Completing 2,000 Fishplates Ahead of Schedule
    [This Newspaper Reports] Our reporters Lin Li and Lu Hao report: In addition to completing the daily repairs of locomotives, passenger cars, and freight cars, the 62 workers of the Tangshan Machine Factory used scrap iron rails to manufacture 2,000 fishplates (i.e., joint bars). The original plan was to complete this work in ten days, starting from March 15th. However, after the work began, the workers worked overtime for four hours each day, in both the north and south workshops simultaneously, and completed the original plan in seven days. On the first day, each furnace in the north workshop had five workers working for four hours, producing 17 to 21 fishplates. By the third day, this gradually increased to 25. In the south workshop, due to insufficient steam hammers, two furnaces shared one steam hammer, saving time between heating the iron. Seven people working four hours increased the production of fishplates to 40. Seeing this situation, the north workshop quickly changed from five people using one furnace to five people using two furnaces. As a result, the output of each furnace in four hours reached 41 to 47 or 48. This naturally formed a production competition between the workers in the north and south workshops. Encouraged by surging labor enthusiasm, the workers automatically requested to add a night shift on Saturday night, and even the foremen joined in, working until 3:30 in the morning before resting. Among them, Tian Hongju, a worker in the south workshop, was particularly praised by everyone. Because he lived far from the factory, he requested to work during the day (i.e., not to work overtime). He used pliers and had three furnaces supplying him with raw materials (i.e., iron materials heated red-hot in the furnace). On the first day (calculated at eight hours), he hammered 115 pieces, and on the second day he hammered 117 pieces, his cotton trousers soaked with sweat. Thanks to the workers' active work, the 2,000 fishplates were completed three days ahead of schedule according to the original plan. Then, they rushed to punch holes in four days, and the task was successfully completed in three days. The early completion of the fishplate manufacturing was also due to the mutual assistance of the workers in various workshops. The car frame workshop automatically came to chop up scrap iron rails, and the material department's transport team of 16 workers helped when there was a shortage of manpower for transportation. The workers of the Tangshan Machine Factory are thus assisting wholeheartedly in the restoration of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway. They eagerly hope that the people's locomotives will soon be running to the riverside.

### 唐山机厂突击生产　提前完成夹板二千块

　　唐山机厂突击生产
  　提前完成夹板二千块
    【本报讯】记者林里、陆灏报导：唐山机厂除完成日常机、客、货车的修理外，工所六十二位工人，用废铁轨＠造夹板（即鱼尾板）二千块，原计划这一工作自三月十五日起，十天完成，但开始后，工人每日以加班四小时南北两屋同时进行，七天即完成原来的计划。第一天北屋每炉五人工作四小时，出夹板十七块到二十一块，第三天逐渐增至二十五块。南屋因汽锤不敷使用，由两炉供给一个汽锤，节省了烧铁时间的空隙，七个人四小时的工作，增产夹板达四十块。北屋见此情况，连忙将原来五人用一炉，改成五人用两炉，其结果各炉四小时产量高达四十一到四十七、八块。这就自然形成了南北两屋工人的生产竞赛。工人们被澎湃的劳动热情所鼓舞，星期六夜晚，自动要求增加夜班，连领班的也下手参加，直至深夜三点半钟才休息。其中尤以南屋工人田洪举获得众人赞扬，他因离家路远，要求白天工作（即不加班），一个人拿钳子，三个炉供给他荒料（即炉中烧红的铁料），第一天（均按八小时计），打一百一十五块，第二天打一百一十七块，汗流湿透了棉裤。由于工人们这样积极的工作，二千块夹板按原计划提前三天完成。接着又以四天时间突击冲眼，然为时三天又告胜利结束。＠造夹板所以能提前完成任务，还依靠各所工人的互相帮助，车架所自动来劈剁废铁轨，缺乏搬运的人手，则得力于材料系运搬股十六位工友的帮助。唐山机厂的工人，就是这样同心协助修复津浦路的，他们热望人民的机车早日开向江边。
