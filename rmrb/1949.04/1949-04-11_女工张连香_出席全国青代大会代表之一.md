　　Female Worker Zhang Lianxiang
　　One of the Delegates to the National Youth Congress
　　Wang Chongwu
　　Among the presidium of the congress, there was a short female representative. She is Zhang Lianxiang, a worker in the roving department of the Huaxin Textile Factory.

　　She is twenty years old this year. Her family lives in Xishuiwuzhuang, three miles away from Tangshan. They have no land, and her grandmother, mother, younger sister, and younger brother live in two rented rooms, a total of five people including her. She started working at the Desheng Porcelain Factory at the age of twelve for two years, and then transferred to the Huaxin Textile Factory, where she has been working for six full years now. Since her father died, the burden of family life has fallen on her and her young second sister, who started working in the spinning department of the Huaxin Textile Factory two years ago. Her third sister, at the age of eleven, was crushed to death by a train while picking coal cinders on the railway.

　　During the Japanese occupation, the daily wage of textile factory workers was generally ten catties of corn. With a large family, they could barely afford to eat, let alone burn fuel or wear clothes. The landlord was still demanding rent. Every night when she returned home, she was always worried, "What can we do when life is so difficult?" At that time, comrades from the Tangshan Municipal Committee were often active in the village where she lived. She gradually became acquainted with one comrade, who asked her, "Life is difficult, why don't you ask the factory to increase wages?" She replied, "Who dares to ask!" Later, she slowly accepted the idea that "there is no food without struggle." Back at the factory, she secretly discussed this matter with her godmother and god-sisters. Mealtime was the best opportunity for propaganda, with real and relevant content. While the female workers were eating sorghum rice, she asked everyone in a questioning tone, "We have such a hard time eating, shouldn't we ask the factory for something?" She was guiding the workers' emotions of struggle. The workers all knew that "asking is good, but when will we be able to endure it!?" "Who will take the lead?" was a troublesome question.

　　The news of the Japanese surrender in 1945 brought illusions about life to the workers. However, the Kuomintang did not bring happiness to the workers. The daily wage was still the same as that stipulated by the Japanese. This year, she gloriously joined the Communist Party of China and actively worked in various workshops in the factory, uniting and mobilizing many workers. In the cold winter, they used the so-called "trade union" established by the Kuomintang to conduct legal struggles. Through the "trade union" group leader, they demanded that the miscellaneous grain wages be changed to flour. After repeated negotiations, the factory finally changed the wages to 40% flour. 40% flour meant giving four catties of flour for a daily wage of ten catties of corn; those whose wages were less than ten catties of corn still did not get four catties of flour.

　　In the factories under the rule of the Chiang bandits, female workers who gave birth to children would not receive wages if they did not work. If they went to work, they had to leave their beloved children who needed breastfeeding. This unreasonable system had to be broken with their own strength. In the spring of 1946, the workers mustered up the courage to formulate eight demands: First, female workers should be given 45 days of leave during childbirth and 5 days of leave during marriage, with wages paid as usual; Second, establish a nursery; Third, issue six yards of cloth per person per month; Fourth, if a worker's immediate family member dies and cannot afford to buy a coffin, the factory shall be responsible; Fifth, change all miscellaneous grain wages to flour; Sixth, issue six towels per person per month; Seventh, issue two pounds of yarn per person per month; Eighth, provide workers with tobacco to smoke. These demands were jointly proposed by our side to the employee and by the workers to the factory, after our side's work, in order to ensure the workers' victory, disguised and entered Tangshan City, and invited the worst employee of the factory. As a result of the struggle, the factory agreed to give female workers maternity and marriage leave, established a nursery, changed six yards of cloth to four yards of cloth, and changed the grain to six or seven tenths of flour (not all). Workers made concessions to the factory on some specific demands, and basically the workers won.

　　In order to realize the demand of changing all wages to flour, in the winter of 1947, Zhang Lianxiang took Liu Cuilan from the spinning department to the outskirts of the city to discuss a solution with our working comrades. After returning to the factory, she mobilized all the workers to go on strike for a day and a half, and the factory had to answer the workers' reasonable demands. However, they were still looking for opportunities to retaliate. One day, a female worker named Wang Lianying said, "Wages should be increased for the workers, the workers are so miserable!" and was fired by the factory until she was reinstated after liberation.

　　Remembering to visit Zhang Lianxiang in the Tangshan delegation, when talking about her past efforts to mobilize workers to increase wages, she smiled and said, "Struggle for the sake of the workers, it would be great if all the workers were better off." Her impressions of attending this conference are: it is so close to Tangshan, but we still take the train and the bus to attend the meeting, it is really different from the past. Attending this conference also allowed me to understand many new things, such as the establishment of the New Democratic Youth League, which allows workers to have unity and organization, and to know how to progress and how to learn. In the past, the Kuomintang organized the Three People's Principles Youth League, the Industrial and Mining Party, and the Special Party in the factory in order to undermine the interests of the workers and provoke worker disunity, so as to smoothly rule the workers. At that time, the factory also ran a tutoring class. As soon as it was organized, I went too, but the curriculum required us to learn English. We are uneducated, it would be good to learn Chinese characters. I asked the teacher what was the use of learning English. The teacher said, "If you learn English well, when the Americans come, you can make a living (eat well)." Speaking of this, it was time for their group discussion. We walked out the door. On the way, she told me: "When the Kuomintang was here, I often brought our newspapers and propaganda materials to the factory. I always went to work early. I am short, and no one paid attention to me. I posted the newspapers and things on the walls, in the toilets, and scattered them throughout the factory, but no one ever knew it was me." I think that Zhang Lianxiang secretly used newspapers to spread the truth and spread victory to the workers, which must have encouraged the courage of many workers and played a great role in the struggle for wage increases against the factory.

　　During the conference's election, a simple introduction to Zhang Lianxiang was made on the election wall in the venue: Zhang Lianxiang, she is a female worker at Huaxin Yarn Factory with eight years of service. Before liberation, she led her fellow workers several times to struggle against the factory and against the puppet trade union. In order to improve the treatment of workers, she tried every means to publicize and prepare. In such a difficult and dangerous environment, she struggled for the workers' cause regardless of herself, and the result was victory. She established prestige among the workers. After liberation, she was elected as a member of the preparatory committee of the Huaxin Yarn Factory Workers' Union, a member of the preparatory committee of the Tangshan Youth Federation. She took the lead in the Yangko team commemorating "February 7th". On "March 8th", she vigorously organized and publicized. She is infinitely loyal to the workers' cause. Therefore, in the democratic election, she was elected as an executive member of the Jidong Youth Federation and a youth representative of the Jidong District attending the National Youth Congress.

　　女工张连香
  　出席全国青代大会代表之一
    王重五
    大会主席团中，一个矮个的女代表，她是华新纺织厂粗纱间工人张连香。
    她今年二十岁，家住在距离唐山三里地的西税务庄，地无一垄，在租的两间房子里，住着她的奶奶、母亲、妹妹和弟弟，连她一共五口人。她从十二岁开始，便被困苦生活的皮鞭驱迫着走入德盛瓷厂做工两年，后转到华新纺织厂做工，至今已整整地六年了。从她的父亲死了之后，家庭生活的重担便放在她和幼小的二妹妹身上，她的二妹妹是在两年前开始在华新纺织厂细纱间做工。她的三妹妹，十一岁那年，在铁路上拣煤渣子的时候，被火车活活地轧死了。
    在日寇侵占期间，纺织厂的工人每日工资一般的是十斤玉米，家里人口多，顾吃顾不了烧，更顾不了穿，房东还在伸着手索讨着租钱。她每天晚上回家时总是发着愁，“生活这么困难有啥办法呢？”那时候唐山工委机关的同志经常活动在她所住的村子里，她和一个同志渐渐地熟识了，那个同志问她：“生活困难，怎么不向厂方要求增资呢？”她回答着：“谁敢去要求哇！”以后她慢慢地接受了“不斗争便没有饭吃”的启示。回到厂子里便找干妈、干姐妹们偷偷地谈论这个事情，吃饭的时候，是个最好的宣传机会并富有现实的宣传内容，女工们吃着高粱米干饭，她以问话的语气向大家说：“咱们吃饭这么难，不兴和厂子要求要求？”她在引导着工人的斗争情绪，工人们都知道“要求是好，要不得熬到啥时候去！？”“由谁出头？”是个伤脑筋的事。
    一九四五年日寇投降的消息，给工人带来了生活上的幻想，但是国民党给工人带来的不是幸福，每日工资仍是沿袭着日寇所规定的那么多，这一年她光荣的参加了中国共产党，更积极的活动在厂里的各工作间，联合、动员了许多工人，在严寒的冬天，利用国民党成立的所谓“工会”进行合法斗争，通过“工会”小组长要求把杂粮工资改成面粉，经过再三交涉，厂方才把工资改为四成面粉。四成面粉就是每日工资十斤玉米的给四斤面；工资低于十斤玉米的，还得不到四斤面。
    在蒋匪统治时期的工厂里，女工生了孩子，不上工没有工资，上工就得扔下需要自己哺乳的爱儿。这种不合理的制度，必须用自己的力量打破它。在一九四六年春天，工人们鼓起勇气拟定了八项要求：第一条，女工在生育期间给假四十五天，结婚期间给假五天，同样开付工资；第二条，成立小孩房；第三条，每人每月发给六码布；第四条，工人直系家属死亡无力购买棺木者由厂方负责；第五条、将工资杂粮全部改成面粉；第六条，每人每月发给六条毛巾；第七条，每人每月两磅线；第八条，供给工人烟吸。这些要求，是在我方工作为了保障工人获得胜利，化装进入唐山市将该厂最坏的一个职员请出来之后，由我方向该职员、由工人向厂方一并提出的，斗争结果厂方答应了给女工生育、结婚假期，成立了小孩房、把六码布改为四码布，把面改为六、七成（不是全部），工人在某些具体要求上，向厂方做了让步，基本上工人获得胜利了。
    为了实现把工资全部改成面粉的要求，在一九四七年冬天，张连香把细纱间刘翠兰，带到市外，来和我方工作同志商议好了办法，回厂后发动全体工人怠工一天半，厂方不得不答复工人的合理要求。但仍是无时无刻的不在寻衅报复，一天女工王连英说了一句“应当给工人增资，工人多苦哇！”的话便被厂方开除，直到解放后才得复工。
    记住到唐山代表团里去访问张连香，谈到她过去发动工人增资时，她微笑着说：“斗争出来为工友，工友都好了多好。”她对参加此次大会的感想是：离着唐山这么近，开会还坐火车坐汽车，真是和过去不同。开这次会又了解了许多新事儿，象现在成立新民主主义青年团，是让工人有团结，有组织，知道怎样进步、怎样学习。过去国民党在厂子里组织三青团，工矿党，特别党，是为了破坏工人利益，挑拨工人团结，好作到顺利的统治工人。那时候厂方也办了一个补习班，刚一组织我也去了，可是课程规定竟学英文，我们没文化，学习字多好，问教员学习英文干啥，教员说：“把英文学习好了美国人来了打腰（吃的开的意思）。”谈到此，已到她们开小组讨论会的时候，我们走出了门口，在路上她告诉我：“国民党在这儿的时候，我常常把咱们的报纸和宣传品带到厂子里头去，都是老早的上工，我个子小，谁也不理会，我把报啥的贴在墙上，厕所里，散撒在厂内各地，始终也没有人知道是我。”我想，张连香偷偷地借报纸来向工人传播真理、传播胜利，不知鼓起多少工人的勇气，在对厂方增资斗争中，一定起了很大的作用。
    大会进行竞选时，在会场里的竞选墙上对张连香做了这样的一个简单介绍：张连香，她是八年工龄的华新纱厂女工，在解放前曾几次领导工友向厂方向伪工会做斗争，为了改善工人待遇，千方百计宣传酝酿，在那样艰危的环境里，不顾自己的为工人事业奋斗，结果胜利了，她在工人中建立了威信，解放后当选为华新纱厂职工筹委会委员，唐山青联筹委会委员，纪念“二七”的秧歌队她起了带头作用，“三八”节她大力地组织和宣传，她对工人事业是无限忠诚的。因此，在民主选举中她被选为冀东青联执行委员，及出席全国青年代表大会的冀东区青年代表。
