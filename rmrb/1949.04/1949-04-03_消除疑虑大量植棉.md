　　Eliminating Doubts, Planting Cotton Extensively
    Farmers in various parts of our region are enthusiastically preparing to plant cotton, with planting already begun in the plains areas, actively responding to the People's Government's call to expand cotton fields by 60% and increase production by 130 million catties of ginned cotton for the entire region. This will provide raw materials for the textile industry in the people's cities, and develop the New Democratic economic construction. This is absolutely necessary and should be done.
    In the past, in the backward rural areas of semi-colonial old China, the raw material crops produced were mostly bought at low prices by imperialists and their running dogs, causing farmers to lose more than they gained, and thus were unwilling to plant cash crops. This kind of resistance was completely correct. Today, the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army have liberated the big cities, and the people themselves own the large industries. The People's Democratic Government is also rewarding and supporting the development of industry and agriculture. The industry of the cities has since become the main force for the welfare of the broad masses of people and the economic prosperity of the people's country. Promoting the planting of cash crops to the countryside precisely provides sufficient raw materials for the people's own industry. The new changes in the relationship between urban and rural areas, making rural production serve large-scale industry, has become a necessary and should be requirement today.
    In the process of promoting cotton planting in various places, some areas have not done enough in-depth publicity and explanation, which resulted in the historical "losing more than one gains" doubts existing among farmers have not been completely dispelled, and some are worried that more production will lead to more burden, etc. Although this phenomenon is not universal, it should attract everyone's attention to carry out the necessary work. To eliminate the farmers' doubts, it is necessary to conduct in-depth and patient publicity and explanation, explaining that the big cities and large industries after liberation need a large amount of raw material crops, and cotton is precisely the raw material needed in large quantities by the large-scale machine textile industry. Not only is the sale of cotton becoming increasingly smooth, but also, due to the new changes in the relationship between urban and rural areas, the benefits of growing cotton are also superior to ordinary crops. At the same time, it is necessary to widely publicize the People's Government's policies on developing industrial and agricultural production, and the specific measures to encourage cotton planting, such as stipulating that one catty of cotton can be converted into eight catties of millet (if the market price is higher than eight catties of rice, then it will be purchased at the market price) for paying public grain, and that more production does not increase the burden, etc. Ideologically, farmers must clearly understand that planting cotton is of great benefit to the national economy and their own production, and they should rise up and actively plant it. In addition, production cooperatives and supply and marketing cooperatives in various places must not only vigorously help farmers solve difficulties such as cotton seeds, but also ensure that cotton and other agricultural products will be purchased at fair prices in the future, to avoid exploitation by merchants and increase farmers' income. In this way, the plan to expand cotton fields can be implemented. It is hoped that all localities will vigorously carry it out and not miss the farming season.

### 消除疑虑大量植棉

　　消除疑虑大量植棉
    我区各地农民正在热烈准备动手植棉，平原地区已开始下种，积极响应人民政府扩大棉田百分之六十，全区增产一万万三千万斤皮花的号召，为人民城市纺织工业提供原料，以发展新民主主义的经济建设，这是十分必要而且应该的。
    过去，半殖民地的农业落后的旧中国农村，所产原料作物，大抵被帝国主义及其走狗所低价收买，造成农民得不偿失，因而不愿种植经济作物，这种对抗是完全正确的。今天，中国共产党，人民解放军解放了大城市，人民自己拥有了大工业，人民民主政府又奖励扶植发展工农业，城市的工业从此变成为广大人民生活福利及人民国家经济繁荣的主力，向农村推广种植经济作物，恰为人民自己的工业供给充足的原料。城乡关系的新的变化，使农村生产为大工业服务，成为今天必要而应该的要求。
    各地在推广植棉中，有的地区由于深入宣传解释不够，致历史上存在于农民中的“得不偿失”的疑虑尚未完全祛除，且有的顾虑多出产了要多负担等，这种现象虽并不普遍，但应引起大家注意进行必要的工作。祛除农民疑虑，深入而耐心的宣传解释，说明解放后的大城市，大工业需要大量的原料作物，而棉花正是大规模机器纺织工业所大量需要的原料，不特棉花的销路日益宽畅，且由于城乡关系的新的变化，种棉利益亦能优于普通作物。同时，必须广泛宣传人民政府发展工业与农业生产的政策，及奖励种植棉花的具体办法，如规定一斤棉花可折合八斤小米（如市价高于八斤米价，则按市价收购）交公粮，多出产并不增加负担等，从思想上使农民明确认识种植棉花是于国家经济、于自己生产都有巨大利益，起而积极种植。此外，各地生产合作社、供销合作社除大力帮助农民解决棉籽等困难外，必须保证将来以公平价格收购棉花及其他农产品，免受商人中间剥削，而增加农民收入。如此，扩大棉田计划才能贯彻，望各地大力进行，勿失农时。
