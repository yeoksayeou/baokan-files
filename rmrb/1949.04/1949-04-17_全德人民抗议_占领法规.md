　　Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, 15th: Berlin dispatch: The announcement of the West German "Occupation Statute" by the US, British, and French governments has aroused the indignation of all German people. In the Soviet occupation zone, more than 500,000 workers in mining, chemical, metallurgy, and light industry in central Germany held protest rallies on April 11, opposing this colonial statute. Enterprises in Brandenburg and Saxony also held protest meetings. Despite the terror tactics of the West German occupation authorities, the protests against the "Occupation Statute" continue to resonate throughout West Germany. The Central Bureau of the West German Communist Party issued a statement saying that the "Occupation Statute" deprives the German people of all the rights of self-determination and sovereignty promised in the Atlantic Charter and the Potsdam Agreement. The Communist Party demands the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany and the withdrawal of all occupation forces. Meyer, the leader of the Social Democratic opposition in Hamburg and a member of the Nazi victims' association, declared: The promulgation of the "Occupation Statute" dispelled all illusions, and West Germany has officially been transformed into a colony.

　　全德人民抗议“占领法规”
    【新华社北平十五日电】柏林讯：美英法政府宣布西德“占领法规”后，已引起全德人民的愤慨。在苏占区，德国中部采矿、化学、冶金和轻工业的五十万以上的工人，于四月十一日举行抗议集会，反对这一殖民法规。勃兰登堡州和萨克森州的企业，也举行了抗议会议。尽管西德占领当局的恐怖行为，对“占领法规”的抗议之声仍在西德此呼彼应。西德共产党中央局发表声明称，“占领法规”剥夺了大西洋宪章和波茨坦决议中应允给德国人民的一切自决权和主权。共产党要求缔结对德和约，并撤退一切占领军。汉堡社会民主党反对派领袖、纳粹主义牺牲者协会会员迈耶尔宣称：“占领法规”的公布、驱散了一切幻想，西德已正式地转变为殖民地。
