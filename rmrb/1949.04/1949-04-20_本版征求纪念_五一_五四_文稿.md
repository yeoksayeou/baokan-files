This page is soliciting manuscripts commemorating "May Day" and "May Fourth."

　　With the liberation of Beiping, the first "May Day" and "May Fourth" anniversaries are approaching. This page hopes that workers and comrades involved in the labor movement from all regions, as well as students, cultural vanguards, and writers, will enthusiastically contribute to our newspaper, reporting on concrete facts, typical figures, and stories of workers' production competitions, inventions, creations, learning discussions, and changes in thought and life. We also hope that cultural vanguards who participated in the "May Fourth" Movement will write about their feelings, or constructive discussions and research on how to carry forward the excellent traditions of "May Fourth" and make contributions to the people's science, culture, and art. All contributions are welcome!
