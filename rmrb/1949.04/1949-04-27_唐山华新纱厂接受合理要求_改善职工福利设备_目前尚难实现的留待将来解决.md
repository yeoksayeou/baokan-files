(Tangshan Electric Dispatch) After liberation, workers at the Tangshan Huaxin Yarn Factory actively engaged in production and also presented opinions to the factory management regarding improvements to worker welfare. On the 7th of this month, twenty-seven representatives, based on the opinions of all employees, negotiated with the factory management, proposing the following requests: 1. Improve medical facilities. Huaxin is a large factory with over two thousand workers, but the medical room only has one doctor and one nurse on duty during the day shift. Workers on the night shift who become ill find it difficult to get treatment, and there are no hospital beds. Therefore, the workers requested the addition of one more doctor and one hospital bed. The factory initially only agreed to hire one more nurse, but the worker representatives argued that nurses cannot diagnose illnesses or prescribe medication. After persistent requests and with the consent of the military representative, the workers' reasonable demand was agreed upon. 2. Add facilities for a sick child isolation room to the nursing room. Many of Huaxin's workers are female and have children. The nursing room has only two rooms, which are very crowded. They requested the addition of a sick child isolation room to prevent contagion and requested the replacement of baby pads and the addition of one female attendant. Except for the replacement of pads, which was not agreed to, the other two items were satisfactorily resolved. 3. Washing and resting room bedding. The factory initially cited "economic difficulties" and only agreed to air them out. After further discussion, it was decided to have them washed by a laundry service. The above three items were resolved on the evening of the 6th. Several other items will be discussed by the employee preparatory committee, which will then send two representatives to negotiate with the factory. 1. Strengthen spring epidemic prevention. The request to provide employees with physical examinations and free vaccinations and smallpox inoculations has been fully agreed to. 2. Improve female toilets. The construction department will immediately study improvements. 3. Improve sanitation in employee bathhouses. The request is to add more pools, keep them clean, and change the water more frequently. 4. Improve the beds in the female worker rest rooms and add straw. In addition, welfare issues such as establishing a nursery for children over ten months old and building a worker's club and recreational facilities are larger in scale, and due to limited funds, will be resolved in the future.

　　唐山华新纱厂接受合理要求
  　改善职工福利设备
    目前尚难实现的留待将来解决
    【唐山电】唐山华新纱厂工人解放后，一方面积极生产，一方面向厂方提出了改善工人福利的意见。本月七日，二十七名代表根据全体职工意见和厂方负责人进行商谈，提出下列要求：一、改善医务设备。华新是一个拥有两千多工人的大工厂，可是医疗室每天只有一位大夫、一位护士作日班，夜班工友发生病症，不易治疗，又无病床，因此工人提出增聘大夫一名，添病床一架。厂方只答应增聘一名护士，职工代表认为：护士不能看病，不会下药。坚持要求，后经详细研讨及军代表的同意，答应了工人的合理要求。二、哺乳室增添病儿隔离室的设备。华新工人多系女工，带小孩的很多，哺乳室只两间，很拥挤。她们要求增辟病儿隔离室，以免传染。并要求更换小孩垫子，增加女仆一人。除更换垫子未获答复外其余二项均圆满答复。三、洗涤休息室被褥。厂方开始借口“经济困难”，只答应晒一下，经再次研讨，始决定叫洗衣局洗。以上三项，六日晚已解决。另外几项由职工筹委会讨论后推派代表二人同厂方商讨。一、加强春季防疫。要求给职工检查身体，免费注射防疫针、种牛痘，已获完全答复。二、改善女厕所。马上由营缮部研究改良。三、改善职工澡塘卫生。要求加添池子保持清洁多换水。四、改善女工休息室床铺加添稻草。另外有关职工福利的问题、如成立十个月以上小孩之托儿所，建立工人俱乐部与游艺场所等，因规模较大，限于经费待将来解决。
