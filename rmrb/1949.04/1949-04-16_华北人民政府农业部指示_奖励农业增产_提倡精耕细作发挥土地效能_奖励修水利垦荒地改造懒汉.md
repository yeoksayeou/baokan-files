　　Instructions from the Agricultural Department of the North China People's Government

　　Reward Increased Agricultural Production
　　Promote Intensive Farming to Maximize Land Efficiency Reward Water Conservancy Construction and Wasteland Reclamation, Reform the Lazy
　　[Report from this newspaper] The Agricultural Department of the North China People's Government issued instructions on April 5 regarding rewarding intensive farming to fully maximize land efficiency and dealing with wasteland issues. The original text is as follows:

　　This year's agricultural production plan has been officially announced, and various localities have successively convened production meetings to make specific arrangements. Recently, the North China Bureau of the CCP Central Committee issued instructions emphasizing the need to mobilize the masses ideologically, organize them, and correctly implement various policies for developing production. With spring plowing already underway, in order to ensure the realization of the production plan and achieve the goal of increased production, we should conscientiously follow the aforementioned plan instructions and lead the masses to immediately carry out the following tasks:

　　1. In areas where land reform has been completed and land rights have been determined, the current focus is on mobilizing the masses to repair farmland, practice intensive farming, promote the new heroism of the masses, launch production competitions, and fully maximize land efficiency. Various localities can formulate reward measures to encourage the production enthusiasm of the masses and the improvement of farming techniques. Under the same conditions, conduct yield competitions, and give honorary or material rewards to those with the greatest increase in production.

　　2. In newly liberated areas where land reform has not yet been carried out or has not yet been completed, and spring plowing has already arrived, it is necessary to earnestly implement the policy of "whoever sows, reaps" to avoid land abandonment. The land of fleeing households that is unattended can be managed by the government on their behalf and rented or lent to farmers with little or no land to cultivate.

　　Pay attention to reforming loafers, and do not allow land to be abandoned. If it has already been abandoned, urge them to cultivate it. It is necessary to carry out mobilization and organization work for loafers and lazy people. Past experience shows that starting with enlightening their consciousness, encouraging inducement, and then organizing and promoting it has a great effect.

　　3. Reward the construction of water conservancy projects and the development of paddy fields. It is necessary to publicize the reward measures stipulated in the agricultural tax regulations. The government can also provide loans and technical guidance, and more assistance should be given to mass cooperative canal construction.

　　4. Reward the masses for reclaiming flat wasteland. The wasteland originally belonging to the public, the wasteland unclaimed for many years, the wasteland with unclear land rights, and the confiscated land of landlords that has not been distributed, except for the large pieces of wasteland designated to be operated by the government, can be contracted by the masses for reclamation (planting grains, pastures, and trees are all acceptable). If cultivated continuously for more than two years, the land rights will belong to the cultivator. Newly reclaimed wasteland will be exempt from agricultural tax for three years. Reclaimed cultivated wasteland will be exempt from agricultural tax for two years.

　　For privately owned flat wasteland, the owners should be urged to cultivate it. If there are difficulties in cultivation, assistance can be given according to the circumstances. If they are indeed unable to cultivate it, they can transfer it to other households with labor through consultation with the owners.

　　5. Strictly prohibit the reclamation of mountain wasteland (sloping land) to prevent mountain floods. For mountain wasteland that has already been reclaimed in the past, the masses can be mobilized to build terraces or replant trees. The agricultural tax regulations stipulate that newly built ones are exempt from tax for three years, which should be widely publicized. If stopping wasteland reclamation affects the lives of the local masses, assistance can be given to them to carry out other production. The mountain area administrative offices and counties can issue announcements prohibiting the reclamation of mountain wasteland and explain the significance of prohibiting the reclamation of mountain wasteland to the masses, urging them to implement it conscientiously.

　　华北人民政府农业部指示
  　奖励农业增产
    提倡精耕细作发挥土地效能  奖励修水利垦荒地改造懒汉
    【本报讯】华北人民政府农业部于四月五日发出关于奖励精耕细作充分发挥土地效能及处理荒地问题的指示，原文如下：
    本年农业生产计划业已正式公布，各地先后召开生产会议作了具体的布置，最近中共中央华北局又发出指示，强调进行群众思想发动、组织起来，正确执行发展生产的各种政策。目前春耕已经开始，我们为了保证生产计划的实现，达到增产的目的，应切实按照上述计划指示，领导群众立即进行以下几件工作：
    一、土地改革已完成、地权已确定的地区，目前中心是发动群众修整耕地，精耕细作，发扬群众新英雄主义，展开生产竞赛，充分发挥土地效能，各地可制定奖励办法，鼓励群众的生产热忱与耕作技术的提高，在相同条件下，进行产量比赛，增产最多者给以名誉或物质之奖励。
    二、在新解放区土地改革尚未进行或进行尚未结束，春耕已经到来，要切实执行谁种谁收的政策，以免土地荒芜。逃亡户无人照管的土地，政府可代管，租给或借给无地少地农民耕种。
    要注意改造二流子，不准荒芜土地，已经荒废的要督促耕种，要对二流子懒汉进行动员与组织工作，过去的经验是多从启发其觉悟，鼓励诱导入手，再加以组织推动，收效很大。
    三、奖励兴修水利，发展水田，要很好宣传农业税则规定的奖励办法，政府并可给以贷款及技术的指导，群众合作修渠的，更应加以协助。
    四、平地的荒地，要奖励群众开垦，原来属于公家的荒地，远年无主的荒地，地权不明的荒地，及没收地主没有分配的荒地，除了指定由政府经营的大块荒地外，群众可以承领开垦（种植谷物牧草及植树均可）。如连续垦种二年以上的，地权即归垦种人。垦种生荒地，免征农业税三年。垦种熟荒地，免征农业税二年。
    属于私人所有的平荒地，应督促本主垦种，垦种有困难的，可酌量情形给以帮助。如确实无力垦种，可商得本主同意，转让其他有劳力的户垦种。
    五、严格禁止开垦山荒（山坡地）以防止山洪泛滥，过去已开垦的山荒，可动员群众修成梯田或改植树木，农业税上规定新修免税三年，应广为宣传，如因停止开荒影响当地群众生活的，可帮助其进行其他生产。山岳地区署、县可发布禁开山荒的布告。并向群众说明禁开山荒的意义，督促切实执行。
