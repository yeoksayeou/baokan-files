　　Production Line
    ▲ Workers at the Materials Factory of the Chahar Provincial Highway Administration completed the task of repairing the Zhangjiakou to Zhangbei section of the highway eight days ahead of schedule. The section is 90 *hua li* (45 km) long. The original plan was for 20 people to complete it in half a month, but only 14 people went. Due to the efforts of the workers, construction began on the 19th of last month and was completed in eight days.

    ▲ Zhang Qinggui, the village head of Gaoji Village, Eighth District, Dong'a County, Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region, introduced a method of preventing insect pests without spending money on crops: Collect the seeds from the stinking elm tree, dry them in the sun, lightly fry them, crush them, and mix them into the seeds when plowing the land. This will prevent insects and act as fertilizer. The dosage is four *liang* (200g) to half a *jin* (250g) per *mu* (667 m²), more is even better. It can be used for any crop, and it is beneficial and harmless to the crops.

    ▲ The Jizhong Jin-Gao Irrigation Canal has now been dug and water has been diverted to begin irrigating the land. The Wen'an County Party Committee had previously convened more than 20 farmers from three villages near the water to make a detailed canal plan. After publicity, the farmers of these three villages automatically formed groups and have now dug a six-*li* (3km) long main canal, which can draw water from outside the south bank of the city, which can irrigate 200 *qing* (1333 ha) of land.
