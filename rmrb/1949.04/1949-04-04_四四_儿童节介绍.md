　　Introduction to the "April 4th" Children's Day
    Today, as we commemorate Children's Day, we should first recall the origin of Children's Day: In 1925, the International Children's Welfare Association, in order to encourage children's interest in progress, learning new knowledge, and better physical and mental exercise, proposed that countries establish a children's holiday. This proposal was endorsed by many countries around the world. Britain then designated July 14th as Children's Day, and the United States also designated May 1st as Children's Day. In China, the Shanghai Chinese Child Welfare Association first called for it in 1931, and April 4th was designated as Children's Day. From 1932 to the present, it has been a full eighteen years. In each "April 4th" Children's Day during these eighteen years, many places in China have commemorated it as usual, but in two regions, the commemorative significance of Children's Day is different. In the cities ruled by the Kuomintang reactionary government, only some children who could afford education and had money could participate in the Children's Day commemoration, so the scope was very narrow. Many children of workers and poor citizens did not know what Children's Day was. But in the liberated areas, the situation was different. "April 4th" Children's Day became a day for all children to review their strength. Because children in the liberated areas almost all participated in the Children's Corps. When the "April 4th" festival arrived, the Children's Corps would convene its own meetings, either by village or by district. At this meeting, they would commend model children in learning, production, and sentry duty. The democratic government also gave them award flags and prizes, making them the direction for everyone to learn from. The children in the liberated areas have been completely liberated ideologically and in their lives.

　　“四四”儿童节介绍
    今天纪念儿童节，首先应该回忆一下儿童节的来由：一九二五年，国际儿童幸福促进会，为了鼓励儿童的上进兴趣，学习新知识，更好的锻炼身心，乃倡议各国定一个儿童节日。这个倡议得到世界不少国家的赞同，英国乃定七月十四为儿童节，美国也以五月一日为儿童节，中国则在一九三一年由上海中华慈幼协会首先呼吁，才定了四月四日为儿童节。从一九三二年起到现在已整整十八年，十八年当中的每个“四四”儿童节，中国的许多地方都循例纪念，但在两个地区，儿童节的纪念意义是不同的。在国民党反动政府所统治的城市里，参加儿童节纪念的，只能是一些受得起教育有钱的儿童，因此范围是很狭小的，许多工人贫苦市民的儿童们，是不知道什么儿童节的。但在解放区，情况就不同了，“四四”儿童节成为所有儿童检阅自己力量的日子。因为解放区的儿童，几乎都参加了儿童团。当“四四”节来到的时候，有的是以村，有的是以区为单位，儿童团便要召集自己的会议，在这个会上，他们要表扬那些学习、生产、放哨等模范儿童。民主政府还送给他们奖旗奖品，使他们成为大家学习的方向。解放区的儿童已在思想上生活上完全被解放了。
