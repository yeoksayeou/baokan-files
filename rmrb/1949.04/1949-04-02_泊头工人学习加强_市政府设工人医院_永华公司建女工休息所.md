From Hebei Central Electric:

　　The Botou City Trade Union has begun to strengthen its leadership over workers' welfare. Currently, various state-owned, and joint state-private factories have established spare-time schools to enhance sanitary facilities, carry out cultural and recreational activities, and universally organize workers' cooperatives. Some factories have also formulated measures to provide special care for female workers. In terms of worker learning, Yonghua Match Company has re-established its workers' spare-time school, assigning dedicated personnel to be responsible for leadership. Currently, all female workers have joined the study program. In the spare-time school of Jushengquan Winery, the factory director personally gives lessons to the workers. The workers of Dazhong Printing Bureau also publish a wall newspaper called "Worker Life" during their studies. Hongye Iron Factory, which had never organized worker learning before, has also begun to organize it. Some factories have also established workers' clubs and amateur theater troupes. The Yonghua Match Company's worker theater troupe has more than fifty workers participating, who write and perform their own plays. The opera "The Whole Family United," written by worker Wu Huizeng, was very popular when it was performed at the "March 8th" Women's Day rally. Male and female workers of Zhonghe Tobacco Factory have also organized a theater troupe and wrote a one-act play called "The Machines are Ours." Yonghua Match Company has also built a sports field with basketball hoops and wooden horses for worker recreation. In terms of sanitary facilities, the former Municipal Baokang Hospital has been converted into a workers' hospital to serve all workers in the city. To ensure that female workers can get adequate rest after work, Yonghua Match Company has begun construction of a rest room for female workers. To solve the problem of employee consumption, Jushengquan Winery, Dazhong Printing Bureau, and two other factories jointly organized a cooperative. Of the 377 employees in the four factories, 230 have become shareholders. Yonghua Match Company's original employee cooperative is preparing to reorganize to better serve its members. Currently, factories and trade unions are working hard to find ways to improve workers' welfare.

  　永华公司建女工休息所
    【冀中电】泊头市职工会对工人福利事业开始加强领导。现各公营及公私合营工厂纷纷建立业余学校，增强卫生设备，开展文化娱乐工作，普遍组织职工合作社。有的工厂并制订了对女工特别照顾的办法。工人学习方面，永华火柴公司重新恢复了工人业余学校，抽出专人负责领导，现全体女工已参加学习；聚盛泉酒厂的业余学校，厂长亲自给工人上课；大众印刷局的工人在学习中并出版了墙报“职工生活”；从未组织过工人学习的宏业铁工厂也在开始组织。有些工厂并建立了工人俱乐部与业余剧团。永华火柴公司的工人剧团有五十余工人参加，他们自编自演。工人吴惠增编的歌剧“全家一条心”在“三八”妇女节大会上演出时，很受欢迎。中和烟厂男女职工也组织了剧团，并自编了一幕话剧“机器是我们的”。永华火柴公司还建立了体育场，设有篮球、木马，供工人娱乐。卫生设备方面，原市立保康医院已改为工人医院，为全市工人服务。永华火柴公司为保证女工下工后能得到适当休息，已动工修建女工休息室。在解决职工消费问题上，聚盛泉酒厂、大众印刷局等四家工厂共同组织了一个合作社，四厂三百七十七名职工，入股者二百三十人。永华火柴公司原有的职工合作社正准备改组以便为社员服务。现各工厂及各业工会正从多方面想办法，要把工人福利事业办好。
