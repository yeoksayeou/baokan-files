　　How the Mentougou Coal Mining Company Mobilized Miners to Abolish the Foreman System?
　　By Our Reporter Gu Weijin
　　I. The Cruel Exploitation of the Foreman System
　　The foreman system is an organization that contracts coal mining from the mining company. The highest manager of the foreman system is the foreman, followed by checkers, head foremen, second foremen, bookkeepers, etc. A system has from sixty or seventy to over a hundred people. Most of the foremen are running dogs of bureaucratic capitalists. They do not participate in any labor and specialize in exploiting workers. For example, when receiving wages from the mine and paying them to the workers, they would extract "one-fifth" (i.e., fifteen percent). The mine pays the workers ten days' wages every fifth day, but they only give the workers five days' wages, depositing the remaining five days' wages in the bank to earn interest or hoard for speculation. In the context of soaring prices, when workers receive their withheld wages after a period of time, they can often buy half as much grain. Foremen often eat "black wages." For example, if twenty people do the work of twenty-five, the workers should receive extra wages, but the foreman fabricates several fictitious names and divides two-thirds of this wage, or swallows it completely. At the end of the month, the foreman's accounts are not made public, and the workers do not know how much they should receive, simply letting the foreman give them some in a confused manner. Foremen also lend money to workers for gambling. Some workers cannot repay the debt, so they work for him forever—risking their lives underground.
　　Workers have never dared to say a word of resistance to this cruel exploitation by the foreman; otherwise, the foreman would immediately warn them, "What? Don't want to work? Get out!" For the sake of their livelihood, workers could only swallow their anger and let the foreman exploit them, living a life of hunger and cold.

　　II. Based on Workers' Consciousness, Decide to Pilot Production Teams to Break Through and Promote Comprehensive Change
　　After the liberation of the Mentougou Coal Mine (i.e., the Sino-British Coal Mine), one of the primary tasks of the takeover team and the trade union was to abolish the foreman system. However, abolishing the foreman system was not a simple matter. The entire mine had twenty foreman systems directly managing more than two thousand workers. If an order were issued to abolish them all, the following situations would need to be considered: First, workers basically demanded the abolition of the foreman system, but under the long-term reactionary rule of the enemy and puppets, their consciousness was poor. Some thought, "Isn't it the same no matter who you change?" Others held a "get by" mentality; Second, the trade union had not been established for long, and the organization was not sound, while there were fugitive landlords and scattered bandits among the workers; Third, there were small factions and cliques among the workers, and they were not very united. Given this situation, it was questionable whether workers could democratically elect leaders with skills, experience, and selflessness if an order was issued to abolish the foreman system. If this were not possible, and the foreman system had already been abolished, it would inevitably cause chaos in the mine and halt production. The leadership studied these situations and decided to first pilot a production team (i.e., organizing some workers to manage production themselves, dealing directly with the mine, and calculating wages based on more work, more pay) to achieve results and promote comprehensive change. At the same time, considering that it would not affect the foreman's production mood or cause other problems, when piloting the production team, it was not publicly promoted outside the team that this team was to replace the foreman system. Instead, it was said that an additional team was being added to mine coal.

　　III. Strengthen Class Education for Activists and Use Activist Activities to Form Brotherly Production Teams
　　The mine trade union relied on the foundation of the underground party to first discover activist Mao Shuduo. This person was straightforward, supported the truth, had worked here for twenty-eight years, had excellent skills and rich experience, and had high prestige among the workers. He had previously served as a checker in the No. 2 system (the checker managed three shifts). Because the No. 2 system merged with another, there were too many checkers, and he voluntarily gave up his position to others and temporarily stayed idle. The trade union actively conducted class education for him, explaining the principle that labor creates the world, that workers are the masters of the mine, and that now that the mine was liberated, the masters should no longer be exploited. It also explained that it was necessary to respond to Chairman Mao's call to fight the enemy in the front and increase production by an inch in the rear so that the working class could be quickly liberated. As a result, Mao Shuduo actively engaged among the workers, promoting the principles the trade union had told him and quickly uniting more than twenty workers who voluntarily left the foreman system (there was freedom to leave the foreman system) and were willing to work with him. Then, the more than twenty workers acted separately and united more than twenty others, forming a brotherly production team, democratically electing Mao Shuduo as the team leader, with six shift leaders, deputy shift leaders, and general affairs officers.

　　IV. Mao Shuduo Sets an Example, Promotes Democracy, Increases Everyone's Enthusiasm for Production, and the Brotherly Production Team Achieves Brilliant Results
　　On March 6th, Mao Shuduo's brotherly production team went down the mine to mine coal. Mao Shuduo called on everyone: everyone should be a model, put in effort, produce more coal, surpass the foreman system, and then the foreman system can be abolished. They were mining coal in a downhill area, which was difficult to mine. The leadership was worried that they would not achieve results and wanted to transfer them to an easier-to-mine area. However, Mao Shuduo and everyone discussed it and said, "No need to transfer, just mine in this place. It will be glorious to achieve results!" At the beginning of mining, Mao Shuduo worked with everyone, breaking the past bad habit of leaders only talking and not doing, which greatly encouraged everyone. First, he promoted the shift leaders to work actively, and then he promoted the entire shift to work actively. In his work, Mao Shuduo promptly helped everyone solve technical difficulties such as drilling holes and setting off explosives, ensuring everyone's smooth coal production and safety. At the same time, Mao Shuduo fully promoted democracy and consulted with everyone on everything, which greatly stimulated everyone's enthusiasm. As a result, the work for ten days yielded great results. First, the coal mining efficiency was greatly improved. The average daily coal production per person in other foreman systems was eight or nine tenths, while the average daily coal production per person in Mao Shuduo's production team, although mining in a difficult-to-mine area, exceeded one tenth. Second, they produced a lot of coal and were able to comply with the mine's coal mining plan: working regularly, not digging indiscriminately, effectively protecting the roadways, and taking care of the safety of fellow workers. Third, they consciously saved materials. Other foreman systems used four ounces of calcium carbide per person per shift (eight hours), which was not enough, while they used only two and a half ounces of calcium carbide per person per shift. Fourth, they took great care of the tools and did not discard or deliberately damage them. Because they dealt directly with the mine and calculated wages based on more work, more pay, their income increased significantly. They originally agreed with the mine to produce six and a half tenths of coal per person per day, but now they produced more than one tenth of coal per day, and could get almost double the wages; in addition, there was no "one-fifth" middleman exploitation by the foreman (i.e., deducting fifteen percent of the wages), and each person could earn five yuan more per shift (People's Banknotes). As a result, everyone's life was significantly improved.

　　V. The Successful Pilot of the Brotherly Production Team Promotes Workers to Automatically Demand the Abolition of the Foreman System
　　In order to promote Mao Shuduo's brotherly production team comprehensively, the mine trade union convened group leader representative meetings and group leader meetings, conducted class education (content as before), and introduced how Mao Shuduo's brotherly production team was organized for production, the results of production, and the increase in workers' income and the improvement of life. These living facts were immediately accepted by everyone, who demanded the abolition of the foreman system. Everyone went back to promote the situation of Mao Shuduo's brotherly production team to the members, who also demanded the abolition of the foreman system. At this time, the workers were all preparing to elect group leaders and shift leaders to lead production. The mine trade union seized the opportunity to conduct democratic education for the workers, explaining the importance of how the quality of the elected leaders was related to everyone's vital interests. The workers then discussed the conditions that leaders should have: technology, experience, and selflessness. When the workers of eight foreman systems had all prepared to elect their group leaders and shift leaders, the mine trade union announced the abolition of the foreman system at the members' meeting. The workers responded enthusiastically, established production teams, and elected group leaders and shift leaders. The workers all happily said, "Abolishing the foreman system not only turned us over, but also turned our hearts over!"

　　VI. Convene Foreman Meetings to Stabilize Order, Reassure People, and Continue Production as Usual
　　Abolishing all twenty foreman systems was a major change. The foremen, checkers, head foremen, and other leaders of the foreman system were anxious, unsure what the abolition of the foreman system meant. Some thought there would be a meeting to complain, some thought there would be liquidation and struggle, and some thought there would be lawsuits. Everyone was not at ease leading production. In order to stabilize order, reassure people, and not affect production, the leadership convened a foreman meeting the day after announcing the abolition of the foreman system, explaining: (1) The abolition of the foreman system was due to the implementation of democracy and the improvement of workers' consciousness, who no longer wanted to be exploited; (2) The abolition of the foreman system was to abolish its unreasonable system, not to liquidate and struggle against the people. At the same time, the foremen had the right to elect and be elected (because some of them were born as workers, had skills, and could be reformed). If they were not elected, they could work if they were willing to work, and they could change careers if they were not willing to work. The mine would try its best to help solve difficulties; (3) During the transition period of the production team's election of group leaders and the preparation of acceptance procedures, the foreman must rest assured to lead production and must not reduce the original production level. At the same time, they must be responsible for the safekeeping of public tools and materials and must not damage them. Private tools and materials can be taken away or sold to the public. After this explanation, the foreman had a bottom line and performed their duties, leading production. From the 20th when the abolition of the foreman system was announced to the 31st when it was completely abolished, production maintained its original level.

　　VII. Educate Workers and Defeat the Foreman's Sabotage Activities
　　During the abolition of the foreman system, some foreman engaged in sabotage activities, promoting to the workers, "Without the foreman's management, it will be chaotic and unable to produce, and everyone's jobs will not be guaranteed." "The foreman is going to lose money, it's still the same whether it's abolished or not." This played a blinding role for some backward workers. The trade union promptly exposed the foreman's conspiracy, especially conducting accounting education for the workers, so that the workers could understand from the accounting that Mao Shuduo's brotherly production team was indeed much better than the foreman system. When the production team elected group leaders and shift leaders, the foreman engaged in sabotage activities again, bribing backward workers to vote for him. However, after the trade union repeatedly conducted democratic education for the workers, the workers defeated the foreman's conspiracy with careful elections. For example, the foreman of the No. 11 foreman system once bribed workers to cast sixty false votes for him. The workers discovered that it exceeded the number of voters and re-elected, and as a result, the foreman got eleven votes and lost the election.

　　VIII. Several Experiences
　　(1) Old factories have many unreasonable systems that must be abolished in order to improve the relationship between the factory and the workers and develop production. However, the leadership must be clear that abolishing unreasonable systems does not mean disrupting the organization. The abolition of the foreman system was to grasp this principle: only the leaders who originally implemented the unreasonable system were replaced, and the organization was not disrupted, such as: replacing the past foreman with the group leader, the checker with the chief shift leader, and the head foreman with the deputy shift leader. Of course, this original organization has many unreasonable places and needs to be transformed in the future; however, from the perspective of not disrupting the organization at that time, it played a great role in stabilizing order, reassuring people, and not affecting production. In the future, we should rely on the consciousness of the working class and transform this organization step by step.
　　(2) Abolishing unreasonable systems cannot rely solely on administrative orders, but must follow the mass line and adopt different methods and steps based on the consciousness of the masses at various stages.
　　(3) Strengthening the education of the working class is the most important link in improving the consciousness of the workers. It is necessary to educate the workers with the principles that labor creates the world and that workers are the masters of the factory, and then the workers will organize and act to fight against all the bad things that hinder their liberation.

　　门头沟煤矿公司如何发动矿工废除包工柜？
    本报记者  古维进
    一、包工柜的残酷剥削
    包工柜就是向矿方包工采煤的一种组织。包工柜的最高管理人是掌柜，下有查头、大头子、二头子、记帐先生等。一个柜上有六、七十人至百余人不等。干包工掌柜的大部分是官僚资本家的走卒。他们不参加任何劳动，专门从事剥削工人。比方，从矿方领得工资付给工人时，要从中剥削“一成五”（即百分之十五）。矿方每逢五号给工人发十天的工资，他们只给工人发五天的，把剩下的五天工资存在银行生息，或屯积居奇。在物价飞涨的情况下，当工人过一个时候领到压支的工资时，经常是少买一倍的粮食。包工柜常吃“黑工”，比方，二十个人，做出二十五个人的活，工人应该多得工资的，但是包工柜捏上几个空名，把这份工资分去三分之二，或者完全吞掉。月终结帐，包工柜的帐目不公开，工人不知该拿多少，只是糊里糊涂让包工柜给上一些。包工柜还放帐给工人赌博，有些工人还不起帐，就永远给他做活——在井下卖命。
    工人对于包工柜这种残酷剥削，从来不敢说半句反抗的话；不然的话，包工柜会马上警告说：“干吗？不想干就滚出去！”工人为了饭碗，唯有忍气吞声任由包工柜宰割，过着饥寒交迫的生活。
    二、根据工人觉悟，决定试办生产组，以便突破一点推动全面
    门头沟煤矿（即中英煤矿）解放后，接管组与工会的首要任务之一，就是废除包工柜。但是废除包工柜不是一件简单的事情。全矿有二十个包工柜直接管理二千余工人生产，如果下一套命令把它全部废除，就要考虑下面几种情况：第一，工人基本上是要求废除包工柜的，但是他们在敌伪长期反动统治蒙蔽下，觉悟较差，如有的人认为“换来换去还不是一样？”有的人抱着“得过且过”的心理；第二，工会筹备起来不久，组织还不健全，而工人中尚有逃亡地主散兵游勇等；第三，工人之间存在小团体小派别，不很团结。根据这种情况，如果下命令把包工柜废除后，工人能否民主选出有技术有经验大公无私的领导人，是一个问题。如果不可能，又已经把包工柜废除，必然引起矿厂混乱，生产停顿。领导上研究这些情况，决定首先试办一个生产组（即把一些工人组织起来，自己管理生产，与矿方直接发生关系，按多劳多得计算工资），从而作出成绩，推动全面。同时考虑不致影响包工柜的生产情绪，或发生旁的问题，在试办生产组时，不在组外公开宣传这个组就是准备代替包工柜的，而是说增加一个组采煤。
    三、加强积极分子阶级教育，并运用积极分子活动，组成兄弟生产班
    矿工会依靠过去地下党的基础，首先发现积极分子毛树多。这人性情耿直，拥护真理，在这里工作二十八年，有优良的技术与丰富的经验，在工人里有很高的威信，曾在二号柜当查头（查头管理三个班的）。因二号柜与别柜合并，查头太多，他自动让职与旁人，暂时闲住。工会积极对他进行阶级教育，说明劳动创造世界的道理，工人是矿山的主人，今天矿山解放，主人不应再受剥削；又说明必须响应毛主席号召，前方打敌人，后方生产长一寸，工人阶级才能很快解放。于是毛树多积极在工人中活动，宣传工会给他讲的道理，很快团结二十余个工人，自愿脱离包工柜（脱离包工柜有自由的），愿跟他一块干活。接着二十余个工人分头活动，又团结二十余人，便组成兄弟生产班，民主选举毛树多当组长，下有六个正副班长、庶务员等。
    四、毛树多以身作则，发扬民主，提高大家生产热忱，兄弟生产班成绩辉煌
    三月六日，毛树多的兄弟生产班下井采煤。毛树多号召大家：人人起模范，鼓上劲，多出煤，赛过包工柜，就能取消包工柜。他们采煤的地方是下山煤，不好采，领导上耽心做不出成绩，要把他们调到好采煤的地方。但是毛树多和大家商量结果，说：“不必调换，就在这个地方采，作出成绩，才算光荣！”采煤开始，毛树多和大家一起工作，打破过去领头的人光说不干的恶习，给大家很大的鼓舞，首先推动班长积极的干，接着推动全班积极的干。在工作中，毛树多及时帮助大家解决打眼放炮等技术困难，保证大家顺利出煤及生命安全。同时毛树多充分发扬民主，凡事与大家商量，更大大发挥大家的积极性。于是工作十天，成绩很大。首先是采煤效率大大提高。旁的包工柜平均每人日产煤八、九分，毛树多的生产班虽然在不容易采煤的地方采煤，平均每人日产煤超过十分。其次，他们出煤多又能遵守矿方采煤计划：做活规矩，不乱挖，切实保护巷道，照顾工友的生命安全。第三，他们自觉的节省材料。旁的包工柜每人上一个班（八小时）点四两电石还不够，他们每人上一个班只用二两半电石。第四，他们对于工具非常爱护，没有乱丢或故意损坏等现象。由于他们与矿方直接发生关系，按多劳多得计算工资，收入大大增加。他们原来与矿方订定每人日产煤六分五，现日产煤超过十分，可以拿到几乎多一倍的工资；另外没有包工柜“一成五”的中间剥削（即从中克扣百分之十五的工资），每人上一个班可以多拿五元工资（人民券）。因此大家的生活相当改善。
　　五、兄弟生产班试办成功，推动工人自动要求废除包工柜
    矿工会为了把毛树多的兄弟生产班推广全面，召开组长代表会议及组长会议，进行阶级教育（内容如前），并介绍毛树多的兄弟生产班怎样组织起来生产、生产的成绩、及工人增加收入生活改善等。这些活的事实，随即为大家接受，要求废除包工柜。大家回去给会员宣传毛树多兄弟生产班的情形，会员也要求废除包工柜。这时工人都准备选组长、班长领导生产。矿工会抓紧向工人进行民主教育，说明选举领导人的好坏与大家切身利害有关的重要性。工人便讨论出领导人要具备有技术有经验大公无私等条件。当有八个包工柜的工人都酝酿好要选的组长、班长时，矿工会在会员大会宣布废除包工柜，工人纷纷响应，成立生产组，选出组长、班长。工人都高兴的说：“取消包工柜，不光是翻了身，连心也翻了个儿！”
    六、召开包工柜会议，稳定秩序安定人心，照常生产
    把二十个包工柜全部废除，是一个很大的变动。包工柜的掌柜、查头、大头子等领导人，惶惶不安，摸不清废除包工柜是怎么回事。有的人认为要开会诉苦，有的人认为要清算斗争，有的人认为要吃官司，大家不安心领导生产。领导上为了稳定秩序，安定人心，不影响生产，在宣布废除包工柜的第二天，即召开包工柜会议，说明：（一）这次废除包工柜，由于实行民主，工人觉悟提高，不愿再受剥削；（二）废除包工柜是废除它的不合理制度，不是连人也清算斗争，同时包工柜有选举权与被选举权（因其中有些人是工人出身，有技术，可以改造）。如果没有当选，愿劳动的劳动，不愿劳动的可以转业，矿方尽可能帮助解决困难；（三）在生产组进行选举组长与准备接收手续这个过渡期间，包工柜必须安心领导生产，不得降低原来的生产水平；同时对于公家的工具材料，要负责保管，不得损坏。私人的工具材料，可以带走，或卖给公家。这样说明之后，包工柜便摸着底，各安职守，领导生产。自二十日宣布废除包工柜，至三十一日全部废除为止，生产均保持原来的水平。
    七、教育工人，击败包工柜的破坏活动
    废除包工柜期间，有些包工柜进行破坏活动，向工人宣传说：“没有包工柜管理，就乱透了，不能生产了，大家的饭碗保不住了。”“包工柜要赔钱了，取消不取消还不是一样。”这对于部分落后工人起了一些蒙蔽作用。工会及时揭破包工柜的阴谋，特别给工人进行算帐教育，使工人从算帐中明了毛树多的兄弟生产班比包工柜确实好得多。当生产组选举组长、班长时，包工柜又进行破坏活动。贿赂收买落后工人投他的票。但是经过工会对工人反复进行民主教育后，工人都以慎重选举击败包工柜的阴谋。如十一号包工柜的掌柜，曾收买工人给他投了六十张假票，工人发现超过选举人数，重新选举，结果该掌柜得十一票而落选。
    八、几点经验
    （一）旧工厂存在许多不合理的制度，必须废除，才能改善厂方与工人的关系，发展生产。但是领导必须明确，废除不合理的制度，不等于打乱机构。这次废除包工柜就是掌握这个原则：只把原来执行不合理制度的领导人换掉，机构没有打乱，如：把过去的掌柜换成组长，查头换成正班长，大头子换成付班长。当然，这个原来的机构是有许多不合理的地方，有待于今后的改造；但是，从当时没有打乱机构说来，对于稳定秩序，安定人心，不影响生产，是起了很大作用。今后应依靠工人阶级觉悟，有步骤地改造这一机构。
    （二）废除不合理的制度，不能单纯依靠行政命令，必须走群众路线，根据群众各时期的觉悟，采取不同的方法、步骤。
    （三）加强工人阶级教育是提高工人觉悟最主要的一环。必须教育工人以劳动创造世界、工人是工厂的主人等道理，然后工人才会组织起来，行动起来，与妨碍自己解放的一切不良东西作斗争。
