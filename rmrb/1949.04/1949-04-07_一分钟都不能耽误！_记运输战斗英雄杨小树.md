　　"Not a Minute Can Be Delayed!"
  　Remembering Transportation Combat Hero Yang Xiaoshu
    ·Hai Tao·
    (I)
    A large crowd was gathered on the main road west of Zhuangzi, as lively as if they were watching someone take a new bride!
    "What's going on?" I was also surprised! So I rushed forward to see what was happening!
    It turned out to be a large truck with six big wheels, stopped there for repairs.
    An old man with a cloth bag embraced the driver: "Xiaoshu! I've finally found you this time!"
    "Second Uncle, I never thought I'd run into you here!"
    "If it weren't for that big black mole by the corner of your mouth, I wouldn't have recognized you!"
    They were uncle and nephew. The driver was called Yang Xiaoshu, from Yutian County, Hebei Province. He joined the Eighth Route Army during the anti-Japanese JiDong Uprising in 1938, when he was only an eighteen-year-old lad.
    When he first joined the Eighth Route Army, he carried an old Type 38 rifle. It was only recently that he learned to drive a car.
    Last December, he participated in an automobile platoon that attacked the Kuomintang bandit army's New Seventh Army near Changchun. At that time, they obtained many guns and bullets, and also captured a dozen enemy soldiers who didn't know how to drive, and four quite new large trucks.
    The guns and ammunition were in hand, but no one knew how to drive the cars. Everyone had to use some comrades to cover the rear, and some comrades to push the cars, planning to push them to a safe area by 2:00 PM. However, at 1:00 PM, the covering comrades discovered more than a dozen armored vehicles coming from the enemy. They had more people, and we had fewer. At the same time, the mission of the assault had been achieved, so they had to order the destruction of these four large trucks, and our comrades safely returned to the original area.
    Since then, Yang Xiaoshu had a "resolve" in his heart.
    "It's like a duck in a muddy pond, damn it, with wings but unable to fly far. If no one can drive the cars away, I must learn to drive them!"
    A month later, he obtained permission from his superiors to go to the People's Liberation Army ×× unit in Harbin to learn about cars!
    When Yang Xiaoshu arrived at the ×× unit, the comrades took him to see one after another of those tiger-like "Eight-Cylinder Ford" brands, "Dodge" brands, "Chevrolet" brands, and ten-wheeled "GMC" brands of large trucks. "These cars were all seized from the enemy by our People's Liberation Army soldiers!"
    From then on, Yang Xiaoshu dreamed every night of driving large trucks.
    "Nothing is difficult in the world for those who set their minds to it." Yang Xiaoshu was very clever. In less than half a year, he was able to go from "stationary driving" to "highway driving" to "snow road driving." During the graduation exam, he didn't knock down a single bamboo pole, nor did he stall the engine once.
    One sunny morning, Yang Xiaoshu was assigned to work in the automobile transport team of the ×× unit at the front. So many days of dreams had finally become reality today, and his mouth was so happy that he couldn't close it.
    (II)
    On the third day after arriving at the automobile team, he received an order to transport artillery shells to the front.
    The work was quite tense. For seven or eight days in a row, the transportation started at 5:00 or 6:00 PM and only stopped at 6:00 or 7:00 AM the next morning. Each car had to make an average of twelve round trips.
    According to the team's regulations, comrades who went on missions at night could make up for seven hours of sleep during the day. But Yang Xiaoshu, he only slept for three hours. He used the rest of the time to wash the various parts of the car, such as the "oil filter," the "fuel pump," checking the various screws on the "steering knuckle," checking whether the "handbrake" and "foot brake" were working? Seeing if the grease fittings were leaking oil? Whether the motor wire was grounding?... He took care of it as meticulously as a housewife taking care of the trivial chores of pots, bowls, ladles, and spoons. He always remembered the speech that the homeroom teacher gave them on the day of graduation:
    "What is most lacking and most precious in the liberated areas? That is cars! One car is equivalent to the property of thirty middle peasants, and our cars are mostly exchanged for by the soldiers with blood and life, which is even more precious! Precisely because of this, we hope that everyone will cherish it when serving, not only be careful and cautious when driving, but also pay special attention to safekeeping at ordinary times. Everyone thinks: If a car is destroyed by the enemy's small planes on the road, an artillery shell is equivalent to the property of a middle peasant, and can kill forty enemy soldiers, then a car has at least two hundred artillery shells. Everyone adds it up, how big is our loss! One task is given to us, not a minute can be delayed! Everyone is a good son and daughter of the Chinese working class, and defeating the Kuomintang bandit army depends entirely on you!"

    (III)
    Once, on a night after a heavy snowfall, at 10:00 PM, Yang Xiaoshu suddenly received an order to transport a carload of artillery shells to ×× place at the front within two hours.
    After receiving the order, Yang Xiaoshu immediately warmed up the car and started it. ... Thirty minutes later, the artillery shells were loaded onto the car, and he drove straight to the front!
    The snow-covered wilderness was like a world of silver. The mountains and forests reflected dazzling white light. Everything was bright and clear. In order to prevent the enemy's small planes and save electricity, Yang Xiaoshu did not turn on the car lights, and drove forward with the help of the snow light.
    The road stretched out in the snowy wilderness, like a long, narrow silver ribbon. The car drove on it, feeling unusually light and agile, except that it was easy to "wag its tail" when turning. He drove cautiously and carefully, and the speed never exceeded forty kilometers per hour, because he was afraid of a tragic rollover!
    "Putututu..." The car suddenly stopped and stalled. Yang Xiaoshu found that a small bridge a dozen steps ahead had been destroyed by the enemy's small planes. Several bridge timbers like the long teeth of an old horse lay tangled horizontally, only pedestrians could pass, and cars absolutely could not drive.
    Yang Xiaoshu quickly got out of the car with his assistant, Lao Li, moved many large stones, filled them under the bridge, and took two planks from the car and placed them on the bridge. Yang Xiaoshu turned on the car lights, aimed the car wheels at the two planks, and drove carefully and meticulously. Just as the car crossed the bridge, when he and Lao Li put the planks on the car, suddenly two enemy small planes, like two large horseflies, "buzzing" and stared. He quickly turned off the car lights:
    "What to do? Let's hide for a while?" Lao Li asked him. Then he said:
    "It's already on top, it's too late!"
    "If it's left here, it will definitely be destroyed by them, go! Not a minute can be delayed!" Saying that, Yang Xiaoshu put his foot on the gas, "Woo!" With a sound, he drove towards the large woods ahead.
    "Geggege..." Like stir-fried soybeans, a burst of small plane machine gun bullets blindly shot around the highway. Yang Xiaoshu felt calm and at peace in his heart, and was not panicked at all. He had unparalleled determination. He gripped the steering wheel tightly, put his foot on the gas, and drove.
    The small plane's machine gun fire became tighter and tighter, and there was another small bridge ahead, and it was a curved bridge. Yang Xiaoshu shifted to third gear and stepped on the gas, as careful as an explorer walking on a glacier. He drove across the small bridge.
    Just as Yang Xiaoshu drove the car into the woods, a burst of dense machine gun fire shot in from the left side of the car window, "Clang!" With a sound, along with the broken glass shards, three fingers on his left hand holding the steering wheel were swept away by the machine gun, and the car suddenly stopped in the white birch forest.
    "Boom!" With a sound, the small plane dropped a bomb about eight or nine hundred meters to the left of the woods, and circled for a while, unable to find the car's trace, before fleeing like a weasel.
    Yang Xiaoshu lost three fingers, but the mission was completed on time, providing ammunition for the front line. At 8:00 AM the next morning, it was heard that the enemy's three "indestructible" hilltops had been taken down by our artillery shells.
    "Three fingers in exchange for three hilltops" "Not a minute can be delayed!" Spread throughout the team.
    Half a month later, Yang Xiaoshu received the "Transportation Combat Hero" medal issued by the captain.
    (IV)
    After the entire territory of Northeast China was liberated, he followed the Liberation Army into the customs, transporting artillery shells on the Beining Railway day and night.
    After the liberation of Tianjin and Beijing, he was also responsible for transporting food and fodder to the "rectification" troops.
    Today, he was ordered to transport military grain to a certain place, but unexpectedly, the car's oil pipe was blocked and broke down here. Coincidentally, he met his second uncle, whom he hadn't seen for ten years, and he was extremely happy!
    After he told his second uncle the story of learning to drive and making meritorious service, the oil pipe was also repaired.
    "Lao Li, listen to see if there is any sound in the fuel tank behind the car?" Speaking, Yang Xiaoshu blew the oil pipe with his mouth: "Glug glug..." The fuel tank echoed:
    "Listen! The dumplings are boiling in the car's belly." The children shouted next to him.
    "Is it fixed?" His second uncle asked.
    "It's fixed!"
    "Let's go! Drive the car to our village and go home and see!"
    "No, Second Uncle, my mission is not yet complete."
    "It won't delay your work, it's only five minutes to drive home."
    "Not a minute can be delayed!" Saying that, he and Lao Li walked into the driver's cab together:
    "Second Uncle! Send a message to my mother and say, wait until the Kuomintang bandit army is completely defeated and the revolution is successful, then I will go home!" After saying that, the car "Woo!" With a sound, it drove away like a gust of wind.
    On the main road of the village, a cloud of dust and a large group of people were left behind.
    "Away from home for ten years, passing by the village but not going home, truly a model People's Liberation Army!"
    "This is all because they are anxious to defeat the Kuomintang bandit army and make meritorious service!"
    "You have this nephew, it's really glorious!"
    The old men were praising Yang Xiaoshu one after another.

　　“一分钟都不能耽误！”
  　记运输战斗英雄杨小树
    ·海滔· 　 （一）
    在庄子西头的大道上，围满了一大群人，好象争看谁家娶新媳妇似的热闹！
    “干啥的？”我也感到惊奇！于是三步并作两脚的走近跟前看个明白！
    原来是一辆六个大轮子的大汽车，停在那里修理。
    一个背布袋的老大爷一把抱住那个司机员：“小树！这一回可见到你了！”
    “二叔，真也想不到会在这里碰见你！”
    “不是你嘴角边的那一颗大黑痣，我真认不出你了！”
    他们是叔侄两个，那个司机员叫杨小树，河北省玉田县人。二十七年冀东大暴动时，他就参加了八路军，那时他才是十八岁小伙子。
    他刚参加八路军时，是背着一只老三八步枪，会开汽车还只是最近年把的事。
    去年腊月，他参加突击长春近郊国民党匪军新七军的一个汽车排，当时获得了很多枪支子弹，还俘掳了十几个不会开汽车的敌军，和四辆挺新的大汽车。
    枪械子弹都拿到手了，但汽车没人会开，大伙只好用一部分同志在后面作掩护，用一部分同志来推汽车，预定两点钟一定可以推到安全的地区。可是，在一点钟时，掩护的同志发现了敌军开来了十几辆装甲车，他们来的人多，我们的人少，同时突击的任务已经达到，于是只得下令把这四辆大汽车烧毁，我们的同志安然的回到了原来的地区。
    自那次之后，杨小树心里有了个“底”。
    “真是泥塘里的鸭子，他妈的有翅不能远飞，就没有人能把汽车开得走，我一定要把它学会开！”
    一个月后，他得到上级的允许，到哈尔滨人民解放军××部学汽车去！
    杨小树到了××部后，同志们带着他去看那一辆一辆的象老虎似的什么“八缸福特”牌的、什么“倒奇”牌的、“雪佛兰”牌的，还有十个轮子的“ＧＭＣ”牌的大汽车。“这些车都是我们人民解放战士们，从敌军手中夺过来的！”
    自那时后，杨小树天天晚上做梦，都在驾驶着大汽车。
    “天下没难事，只怕有心人。”杨小树心很灵，不到半年，就能由“原地驾驶”而“公路驾驶”而“雪道驾驶”了。在毕业考试时，他没有轧倒过一根竹竿，也没有熄过一次火。
    一个大晴天的早上，杨小树被分发到前方××部汽车运输队工作，多少天的梦想，今天才变成事实，他的嘴喜得都合不拢。 　 （二）
    来到汽车队的第三天他就接到运输炮弹往前方去的命令。
    工作是相当的紧张，一连七八天都是晚上五、六点钟开始运输，第二天早上六、七点才停止，每一辆车平均要运十二个来回。
    按照队上的规定，凡是夜间出差的同志，在白天可以补睡七个钟头，可是杨小树呢，他只睡三个钟点，他利用那其余的时间，洗刷车子的各部份机件，象“机油滤清器”啦，“油棒浦”啦，检查“方向接头”上的各种镙丝呀，检查“手刹车”“脚刹车”灵不灵？看看黄油嘴子冒不冒油？马达线打铁不？……他象一个主妇料理锅、碗、瓢、杓那些琐碎的家务似的那样尽心。他时时惦记着在临毕业那天班主任给他们的那一段讲话：
    “在解放区什么最缺乏，又最宝贵？那是汽车！一辆汽车合三十个中农的家产，而我们的汽车又多是战士们用血肉和生命换来的，尤其更宝贵！正因为这，所以希望各位服务时要珍贵它，不特驾驶时要小心谨慎，就在平常也要特别注重保管。大家想：假若有一辆车子走在路上被敌军的小飞机炸毁了，一个炮弹合一个中农的家产，能炸死四十个敌军，那么一车最少有二百个炮弹，大家合合，我们的损失多大！一个任务给我们，一分钟也不能耽误！大家都是中国工人阶级的好儿女，打垮国民党匪军全赖你们！……” 　 （三）
    一次，在一个大雪过后的夜晚十点钟，杨小树突然接到一个叫他在两点钟以内，把一车炮弹，运到前方××地的命令。
    接到命令后，杨小树马上烤热了车子，发动起来。……三十分钟之后，炮弹装上了车，他就一直开向前方去！
    雪后的原野，象银子的世界，山岭树林都反射着刺目的白光，一切都是明明亮亮的，杨小树为了防敌军的小飞机及省电起见，汽车灯不开，借着雪光驾驶着前进。
    公路在雪的原野里伸展着，就象一条狭长的银色的带子，汽车在上面行驶着，感到异常的轻快与敏捷，只不过有时在转弯时容易“歪屁股”罢了，他谨慎又小心的驾驶着，速度从来没有超过一点钟四十公里，他怕遭到翻车的惨剧！
    “吐吐吐……”车子突然停下来熄了火，杨小树发现了前面十几步远的一座小桥被敌军的小飞机炸毁了。象老马的大长牙的几根桥木，错综的横躺着，仅仅是行人可以通过，车子绝对不能行驶。
    杨小树赶快同他的助手老李走下车，搬了很多大石头，填在桥下，又把两块跳板，从车上抽下来搭在桥上。杨小树把车灯开开，汽车轮子对准两道跳板，他小心翼翼仔仔细细的开着。在车子刚过了桥，他同老李把跳板放到车上时，突然两架敌军的小飞机，象两个大的牛虻似的，“嗡嗡嗡”的盯上来了，他很快熄了车灯：
    “怎办？我们躲一下吧？”老李问他。接着又说：
    “已经到头上了，来不及了！”
    “放在这一定会被他们炸毁，走！一分钟也不能耽误！”说着，杨小树加足了马力，“呜！”的一声，开向前面的大树林去。
    “咯咯咯…………”象炒爆豆似的，一阵小飞机的机枪弹，盲目的向公路四周乱射。杨小树心里安稳、平静，一点也不慌张恐怕。他有的是无比的坚定，他握好方向盘，加足油开走着。
    小飞机的机枪越来越紧了，前面又是一座小桥，而且是一个弯弓形的小桥。杨小树换上三档加上油，象一个探险家行走在沟冰上一般那样小心，他开过了小桥。
    当杨小树刚把车子开进树林中时，一阵火密的机枪，从车子窗子的左面射进来，“当啷”一声，随着被打碎的玻璃片，他握在方向盘上的左手的三个指头被机枪扫掉，车子突然地在大白桦林中停了下来。
    “轰！”的一声，小飞机在树林左面，约有八九百米处丢了一个炸弹，又盘旋了一阵，寻不见汽车的踪影，才象黄鼠狼似的逃窜了。
    杨小树被打掉了三个手指头，但任务却准时完成，使前线的弹药得到接济。到了第二天上午八点钟，听说敌军的三个“打不垮”的山头，被我们的炮弹打下来了。
    “三个手指头换来三个山头”“一分钟都不能耽误！”在全队喊开了。
    半个月之后，杨小树得到了队长颁发的“运输战斗英雄”的奖章。 　 （四）
    东北全境解放后，他随着解放大军入了关，整天整夜的在北宁路上运送着炮弹。
    平津解放后，他又担任给“整训”的部队运送粮秣。
    今天，他奉命到某某地去运送军粮，不料，车子油管塞住，坏在这里，恰巧又遇见他十年没见面的二叔，他真是高兴极了！
    他将学会开汽车，和立功的故事，对他二叔讲完了，油管子也修通了。
    “老李，你听听车后面油箱里有声音没有？”说着杨小树用嘴把油管子一吹：“鼓咚咚……”油箱起了回声：
    “听！汽车肚里煮饺子开锅了。”儿童们在旁边叫着。
    “修好了吗？”他二叔问
    “修好了！”
    “走吧！把车子开到咱们庄去回家看看吧！”
    “不成，二叔，我的任务还没有完成。”
    “不耽误你的事，五分钟就开到家了。”
    “一分钟都不能耽误！”说着他同老李一同走进驾驶室：
    “二叔！捎个信给我妈说，等到完全打垮国民党匪军，革命成功我再回家！”说完汽车“呜！”的一声，一阵风开走了。
    在庄子的大道上，留下一片尘土和一大群人。
    “离家十年，路过庄开不回家，真是模范的解放军！”
    “这都是为了打垮国民党匪军，立功的心急呀！”
    “你有这个侄子，真够光荣！”
    老大爷们在纷纷地夸赞着杨小树。
