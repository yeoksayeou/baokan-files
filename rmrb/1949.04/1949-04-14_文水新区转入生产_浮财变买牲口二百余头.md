　　WenShui New District Shifts to Production
  　Seized Wealth Used to Buy Over Two Hundred Head of Livestock
    [Jinzhong Electric] After more than two months of land reform movement, Wenshui County temporarily concluded on March 25th and is now fully engaged in spring plowing. According to investigations, farmers in all villages that have undergone land reform are actively engaged in production. The first, third, fourth, and eighth districts have used a portion of the seized wealth from the struggle to purchase over two hundred head of livestock. Beixu Village in the first district has purchased over 40,000 catties of fertilizer and over 10,000 catties of grain. Daling Village in the fourth district, in addition to purchasing 30,000 catties of fertilizer, is also preparing to buy 400,000 shi of grain to solve the seed and food problems of poor farmers. To solve the seed shortage, agricultural association cadres in Wenyi Village personally pushed wheat to the market to exchange for barley and cotton seeds. More than 300 catties of peanuts from the struggle were distributed to poor families of revolutionary martyrs, soldiers, and workers, as well as poor farmers, after public discussion by the masses. The masses in Baozi and seven other villages in the first district are rushing to repair irrigation canals to increase production. Longquan and three other villages are also planning to dig canals. On March 21st, the third district convened a joint meeting of agricultural association directors and production committee members from various villages. In the meeting, except for Wenyun Village, where the soil is poor and livestock is lacking, the entire district guarantees that no land will be left uncultivated. Of the 70,000 mu of irrigated land in the eighth district, 90% has already been irrigated. Xicheng Village in the fourth district lacks livestock, so farmers have organized labor exchanges, using manpower to cultivate the land, which has also solved many difficulties.
