Jiluyu Electric Dispatch: The Sixth Office of the Jiluyu Branch of the People's Bank of China, in order to support agricultural production and do a good job in spring loan work, held a meeting of branch managers from eight counties including Liaocheng on March 17th. It formulated a plan to support agricultural production this spring and resolved the bank cadres' idea of relying solely on funds allocated by higher authorities, as well as the patronizing view of lacking confidence in recovering old loans. The meeting proposed that old loans must be diligently recovered. According to statistics, the bank's funds in the entire special district, converted into physical goods, amounted to approximately 1.73 million jin of wheat (as of the end of December last year). Currently, the inventory of funds is equivalent to slightly over 132,000 jin of wheat, with 92% of the funds out on loan. Therefore, if old loans are not recovered, the task of supporting production will be difficult to complete. The specific figures for the recovery plan are stipulated as follows: old loans due by the end of March in the entire special district amount to 687,349 jin of wheat, and loans due before the end of April amount to 235,129 jin; it is guaranteed that 140,000 jin will be recovered by the end of March, and 369,340 jin will be recovered by the end of April. A total of 509,340 jin will be recovered in March and April.

  　冀鲁豫聊城等八县决定收回到期旧贷
    【冀鲁豫电】中国人民银行冀鲁豫分行第六办事处，为扶助农业生产，作好春季贷款工作，于三月十七日，召开了聊城等八县支行经理会议，作出今春扶植农业生产计划，并解决了银行干部专依靠上级拨资金的思想，以及对催收旧贷没信心等恩赐观点。会议提出必须认真催收旧贷。据统计，全专区银行资金折成实物，约计麦子一百七十三万斤（去年十二月底统计的），目前库存资金折麦十三万二千余斤，百分之九十二的资金在外边。因此如不催收旧贷，扶植生产任务是很难完成的。催收计划的具体数字规定为：全专区三月底到期旧贷折麦六十八万七千三百四十九斤，四月底前到期贷款二十三万五千一百二十九斤；在三月底前保证完成催收数字十四万斤，四月底完成催收三十六万九千三百四十斤，三四个月共完成催收五十万零九千三百四十斤。
