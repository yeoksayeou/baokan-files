Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, 6th: The study of employees in various public and private enterprises in Tianjin has achieved initial success. Since the liberation of Tianjin, employees of public and private enterprises throughout the city have made enthusiastic use of production gaps to study revolutionary knowledge and cultural and technical knowledge. The Bureau of Public Works, Motor Transport Department, Telecommunications Bureau, Steel Plant, Railway Department, China Textile Corporation, and Postal Bureau have all established learning committees to lead the study. Systems such as the Public Utilities Bureau have also held short-term political study classes, absorbing more than forty employees to participate in the study. Huang Kecheng, director of the Military Control Commission, and Huang Jing, mayor of the municipal government, visited many factories during the study period to give speeches, encouraging the enthusiasm of the employees. Cadres of various agencies enthusiastically served as instructors, systematically explaining the policy knowledge of the People's Government and, in connection with the actual situation and personal experience of the employees, conducting class education for the working class. After more than two months of study, the employees' political understanding has been initially improved, and some doubts caused by the deceptive propaganda of the Kuomintang reactionaries have gradually been eliminated, thereby increasing the enthusiasm for production. When the employees of the Tram Management Office studied in the study class, they planned how to improve production efficiency after returning to the factory; after returning to the factory, they broke the previous record in vehicle repair. A riveter in the Automobile Assembly Plant originally had a very poor production mood, but after participating in the study class and returning to rush-weld the large axle, he increased the production rate by more than 30%. Some employees of the Tram Management Office, after returning home, told their families what they had learned in the factory, exposing various rumors of the Kuomintang reactionaries. Workers from the Waterworks who participated in the study class went to the factory half an hour before work every day to help organize workers to study, telling other workers what they had learned in the study class. After the workers' political awareness was improved, they requested to join the Chinese Communist Party and the New Democratic Youth League one after another. After participating in the study class, some employees of the Tram Management Office requested to join the Chinese Communist Party, the New Democratic Youth League, or the southbound work team. In the study class of a factory in the former Joint Logistics System, nine workers, after listening to the brief history of the CCP and Chairman Mao's struggle stories, wrote applications requesting to join the Communist Party, and expressed that if they were not yet qualified to join the Party, they would continue to work hard to improve themselves and strive to be able to join the Party in the future. In private enterprises, the employees' enthusiasm for learning is also very high. Yizhong Tobacco Company and Kailuan Coal Mine have both held three-day large-class study classes. The main shortcomings in the learning of various units are that they do not focus enough on educating employees in the materialistic conception of history and do not consciously enlighten workers' class consciousness from the root. Secondly, they have not fully promoted the backbone role of employees who have participated in study classes in the broad masses of workers. The Tianjin Office of the Preparatory Committee of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions is actively assisting various units to overcome these shortcomings and improve learning.

　　津市工人政治觉悟提高
    许多人要求加入中共
  　各公私企业职工学习成绩大
    【新华社天津六日电】天津市各公私企业职工的学习，已收到初步成效。津市解放后，全市公私企业职工即纷纷利用生产间隙，热烈学习革命知识和文化的技术的知识。工务局、摩托处、电讯局、钢铁厂、铁道处、中国纺织公司及邮政局等单位，都先后成立了学习委员会领导学习。公用局等系统还举办了短期政治学习班，前后吸收了四十余名职工参加学习。军管会黄克诚主任、市政府黄敬市长等在学习期间曾分赴许多工厂讲话，鼓励了职工们的学习热情。各机关干部均热心担任教员，比较有系统地讲解人民政府的政策知识，并联系职工的实际情况和切身经验，进行工人阶级的阶级教育。经过两个多月来的学习，职工们的政治认识已有初步提高，过去由于国民党反动派的欺骗宣传所造成的一些疑虑已逐渐消除，从而提高了生产积极性。电车管理处的职工在学习班中学习时，就计划着回厂后如何提高生产效率；回厂后，在车辆修理上就打破了已往的纪录。汽车装配厂铆工原来生产情绪很差，但在参加学习班回来后突击焊大轴时，便提高生产率百分之三十以上。电车管理处有些职工回到家里，就把在厂里学习的讲给家里的人听，揭破国民党反动派的种种谣言。自来水厂参加学习班的工人，每天在上班前半点钟便到厂帮助组织工人学习，把自己在学习班里学到的告给其他工友。工人们在政治觉悟程度提高以后，纷纷要求加入中国共产党和新民主主义青年团。电车管理处有些职工在参加学习班后，便分别要求加入中国共产党、新民主主义青年团或南下工作团。前联勤系统的工厂的学习班中有九个工人在听了中共简史和毛主席的奋斗故事后，便写志愿书，要求加入共产党，并表示如现在还不够入党条件，决继续努力提高自己，争取在将来能够入党。在私营企业中，职工们的学习情绪也很高。颐中烟草公司和开滦煤矿都开过三天的上大课式的学习班。各单位在学习中存在的缺点，主要是着重职工进行唯物史观的教育不够，没有有意识地从根本上启发工人的阶级意识。其次是没有充分地发扬参加过学习班学习的职工在广大工人群众中的骨干作用。华北总工会筹备会天津办事处正协助各单位积极克服这些缺点，改进学习。
