Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, April 3rd—The All-China Students' Federation issued a circular to the entire country on the 3rd, protesting the Nanjing Kuomintang reactionary government's crime of slaughtering patriotic students. The full text is as follows: Fellow countrymen, students across the country!

　　Just as the Kuomintang reactionary government sent representatives to Beiping for peace talks, a bloody massacre broke out in Nanjing, with the reactionary government killing, injuring, and arresting more than two hundred students! The demonstration of six thousand students in Nanjing was to oppose the Kuomintang reactionary government's continued preparation for counter-revolutionary war under the guise of peace, demanding immediate acceptance of Chairman Mao's eight peace conditions, and the realization of genuine peace. This is a manifestation of the true will of the people! However, Zhang Yaoming, the Nanjing Garrison Commander of the Kuomintang, under the command of Chiang Kai-shek, Tang Enbo, and others, and with the connivance and cooperation of Li Zongren, He Yingqin, and others, completely refused to change his brutal nature and instigated military police and secret agents to create a great bloody tragedy. The towering crimes of the Kuomintang reactionary government in persecuting and slaughtering students and the people in the past have not yet been settled by the people, and now they dare to slaughter a large number of students who demand genuine peace at the time of peace talks. These war criminals and executioners have no remorse, and they have no sincerity in achieving genuine peace for the people, but only want to use peace talks as a cover, attempting to preserve the remaining military forces in order to make a comeback. This conspiracy has been fully exposed in this bloody massacre! We cannot but express our great anger about this! We students, who have suffered cruel persecution by the Kuomintang reactionary government, can no longer tolerate or forgive the war criminals for this crime. If the leaders of the Nanjing Kuomintang reactionary government, Li Zongren, He Yingqin, and others, cannot immediately arrest and severely punish the Kuomintang executioners Chiang Kai-shek, Tang Enbo, Zhang Yaoming, and others who instigated the killing and beating of Nanjing students, then it proves that this so-called peace government is completely a deceptive tool of the Chiang Kai-shek reactionary clique. The All-China Students' Federation calls on all students in the liberated areas and the Kuomintang-controlled areas to fully support the heroic struggle of the Nanjing students. We must resolutely support Chairman Mao's eight genuine peace conditions, and under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, quickly and thoroughly destroy the Kuomintang's reactionary rule, liberate Nanjing, liberate all of China, capture, try, and punish war criminals, and avenge the dead students and compatriots!

　　全国学联通电
  　抗议南京反动政府屠杀爱国学生罪行
    【新华社北平三日电】中华全国学生联合会于三日向全国发出通电，抗议南京国民党反动政府屠杀爱国学生的罪行。全文如下：全国同胞，全国同学们！
    正当国民党反动政府派出代表到北平进行和平谈判的时候，南京却爆发了反动政府打死打伤和逮捕两百余同学的大血案！南京六千同学的示威游行，是为了反对国民党反动政府在伪装和平的阴谋下，继续进行反革命战争的准备，要求立即接受毛主席八项和平条件，实现真正和平，这是真正人民意志的表现！然而国民党南京卫戍总司令张耀明，在蒋介石、汤恩伯等人的指挥之下，在李宗仁、何应钦等人的纵容合作之下，却完全不改凶残的本性，嗾使军警特务造成流血大惨案。国民党反动政府过去残害屠杀学生和人民的滔天罪恶还没有经过人民的清算，而现在竟敢在谈判和平的时候又大批杀害要求真正和平的同学。这些战争罪犯和刽子手们，丝毫没有悔祸之心，他们毫无诚意实现真正人民的和平，只是想借和平谈判为掩护，企图保存残余的军事力量，以便卷土重来。这种阴谋，在这次血腥屠杀中完全暴露出来了！我们对此不能不表示极大的愤怒！我们曾受尽国民党反动政府残酷迫害的同学，对战犯们的这次罪行，决不能再忍受了，决不能再宽恕了。南京国民党反动政府的首领李宗仁、何应钦等人如果不能立即逮捕并严惩唆使杀害及殴打南京同学的国民党刽子手蒋介石、汤恩伯、张耀明等人，那么就证明这个所谓和平政府完全是蒋介石反动集团的欺骗工具。中华全国学生联合会号召解放区及国民党统治区的全体同学们，全力支持南京同学们的英勇斗争，我们一定要坚决拥护毛主席的八项真正和平的条件，在中国共产党的领导下，迅速彻底地摧毁国民党的反动统治，解放南京，解放全中国，捉拿、审判和惩办战争罪犯，为死难同学和同胞复仇！
    中华全国学生联合会　四月三日
