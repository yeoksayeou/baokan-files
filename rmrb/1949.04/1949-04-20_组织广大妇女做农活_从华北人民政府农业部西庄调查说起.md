　　Currently, the lack of labor has become the main difficulty in restoring and developing agricultural production. This year's agricultural production plan proposes mobilizing 50% of women's labor to participate in agricultural production. This is the main key to solving the labor shortage. The Agricultural Department of the North China People's Government conducted a survey on women's production in Xizhuang, Pingshan, which can illustrate some issues.

　　Xizhuang, Pingshan, is a village of over ninety households, mostly paddy fields. In the past, women had the habit of participating in agricultural production, but after liberation, attention was not paid to organizing and leading them, so it was still a spontaneous action, and development was uneven. According to a survey of twenty-two households in the village, among the twenty-eight women with full labor capacity, two can match a full male laborer in agricultural production (generally able to cultivate seven mu of paddy fields), four can match 50% to 80%, fifteen can match 50% to 30%, and seven do not work in the fields, accounting for 25% of the total women's labor force. Some women work exactly like men. Except for plowing and applying manure, they can do all other farm work. For example, Fengye and Lianhua independently cultivate six or seven mu of paddy fields. Sowing, weeding, watering, harvesting, delivering manure, and pushing carts are all done the same way as men. Many other women are also largely the same. Because women participate in agricultural production, a large number of male laborers are saved, and the village has more income from sideline occupations, which is precisely the reason.

　　In other areas, especially old liberated areas, the participation of women in agricultural production is also gradually increasing. According to statistics from ninety-two villages in six counties including Taigu in Jinzhong District, women participating in the autumn harvest accounted for 66.5% of the total women's labor force. In Cha Province, during last year's summer hoeing and harvesting, in villages with a better work foundation, the number of women participating accounted for about 80% of the women's labor force. The labor hero conference in the 13th District of Jidong selected nine heroes, six of whom were women, indicating that it is entirely possible to mobilize women to participate in agricultural production.

　　Valuing Women's Contributions to Family and Society

　　To mobilize women to participate in agricultural production, we must first fight against the erroneous ideas that do not value women's work. We must understand that women make great contributions to the family and society. Women's household chores, such as sewing, cooking, grinding flour, taking care of children, and washing clothes, keep them busy all day long, and their working hours are very long, often working until midnight. In the entire family economic income, women's income also accounts for a large proportion. According to the Xizhuang survey, the average income per person is 6.43 shi of grain, of which 78.1% of agricultural income is earned by male labor and 21.9% is earned by female labor. In sideline occupations, 54.8% of income is earned by male labor and 45% is earned by female labor. Combining agriculture and sideline occupations, male labor income accounts for 67% and female labor accounts for 33%. That is to say, one-third of the entire family life is earned by women's labor. Assuming that the average value of women's chores and family income is calculated as wages, then women's labor income in the family should be more than 40%.

　　Taking Care of Women's Special Difficulties

　　Secondly, mobilizing women to participate in agricultural production requires taking care of women's special difficulties, such as taking care of children. In Xizhuang, among the women who are able to work, an average of one in five has a child under the age of three. If this problem is not solved well, it often affects their production. Therefore, women with children cannot be required to do the same as ordinary women. If older women are well organized to take care of children, their working hours can be increased. In addition, we must take care of women's physical strength. For example, women with bound feet should not be forced to do heavy work. During menstruation, before and after childbirth, they should do lighter work or take appropriate rest. In addition, we should pay attention to solving various problems that affect production, such as family discord and women being abused. The Xizhuang survey proves that most of the women who do not participate in agricultural production do so because of family discord and lack the energy to go to the fields.

　　Improving Women's Production Consciousness

　　Thirdly, mobilizing women to participate in agricultural production requires emphasizing ideological mobilization, inspiring their consciousness, and recognizing that only through labor and production can women's family and social status be improved, and overcoming women's dependent thinking of "marrying a man to eat." Facts have proved that women who participate in labor, especially agricultural labor, have significant changes in their family and social status. In Xizhuang, because women contribute more than one-third of the income to the family's economic life, women and men no longer eat different meals, and women also participate in family economic management. Women's own living habits have also changed. Women under the age of 30 have eliminated the bad habit of foot binding, and some even go barefoot when working in the fields, just like men.

　　Finally, mobilizing women to participate in agricultural production labor should pay attention to cultivating and promoting women cadres. Pindong has done a better job in women's production work, precisely because they newly promoted 28 women cadres, which enabled women's work to be carried out and overcame the erroneous views of some cadres who did not value women's work.

　　组织广大妇女做农活
    ——从华北人民政府农业部西庄调查说起
    大明　碧涛
    目前劳力缺乏成为恢复与发展农业生产的主要困难，本年农业生产计划中提出动员百分之五十的妇女劳力参加农业生产，这是解决劳力困难的主要关键，华北人民政府农业部曾在平山西庄做了妇女生产的调查，可说明一些问题。
    平山西庄是九十余户的村庄，大部是水地，过去，妇女就有参加农业生产的习惯，但在解放后未注意组织领导，因此还是一种自发的行动，发展也不平衡。根据该村二十二户调查，妇女全劳力二十八人中，在农业生产中，能顶男全劳力者（一般标准能种七亩水地）二人，顶百分之五十以上至百分之八十者四人，顶百分之五十至百分之三十者十五人，不上地劳动的七人，占女全劳力百分之二十五。有些妇女完全同男人一样劳动，除翻地、出粪两项活外，其余农活都能干。如凤叶、莲花都独立种六、七亩水地，下种、锄苗、浇水、收割、送粪、推车都同男子一样，其他好多妇女也大都如此。由于妇女参加了农业生产，节省了大批男劳力，该村副业收入较多，也正是这个原因。
    在其他地区，特别是老解放区，妇女参加农业生产的也日渐增多。据晋中区太谷等六县九十二村统计，妇女参加秋收的占妇女全劳力百分之六十六点五；察省在去年夏锄夏收中，工作基础较好的村，妇女参加人数占妇女劳动力的百分之八十左右。冀东十三专区劳动英雄大会选出九个英雄，其中六个是妇女，说明发动妇女参加农业生产是完全可能的。
　　重视妇女对家庭社会的贡献
    发动妇女参加农业生产，首先应向那些不重视妇女工作的错误思想作斗争。要了解妇女对家庭对社会都有很大贡献。妇女的家庭杂活，如缝纫、作饭、推碾磨、领孩子、洗衣服等，一天到晚忙个不停，劳动时间很长，常常工作到半夜。在整个家庭经济收入中，妇女的收入也占很大比重。据西庄调查，每人平均收入折谷六点四三石，其中农业收入中靠男劳力收入者占百分之七十八点一，靠女劳力收入者占百分之二十一点九，在副业上靠男劳力收入者占百分之五十四点八，靠女劳力收入者占百分之四十五；农副业合计，男劳力收入占百分之六十七，女劳力占百分之三十三。也就是说，整个家庭生活中有三分之一是由妇女劳动所得，假定将妇女的杂活时间与家庭收入平均按工资计算，则妇女在家庭中的劳动所得，要在百分之四十以上。
　　照顾妇女特殊困难
    其次，发动妇女参加农业生产，要照顾妇女的特殊困难，如带孩子等。西庄能够劳动的妇女，平均五个人有一个三岁以下的小孩，这个问题解决不好，常常影响她们的生产，因此，对有小孩的妇女，不能与一般妇女同样要求。如果好好组织老年妇女代看孩子，则可增加她们的劳动时间。另外要照顾妇女体力，如小脚妇女，不应强作重活；在经期、产前、产后都应当作较轻的活，或适当的休息。此外并应注意解决影响生产的各种问题，如家庭不和睦、妇女受虐待等问题。西庄调查证明，不参加农业生产的妇女，大多数是因为家庭不和，没劲儿下地。
　　提高妇女生产自觉
    再次，发动妇女参加农业生产要重视思想发动，启发其自觉，认识从劳动生产中才能提高妇女家庭社会地位，克服妇女“嫁汉吃汉”的依赖思想。事实证明，凡妇女参加了劳动特别是参加了农业劳动的，家庭社会地位，都有显著的变化。西庄由于妇女在家庭经济生活中贡献了三分之一以上的收入，妇女和男子已再不吃两样饭，妇女且参加了家庭经济管理。妇女本身的生活习惯也起了变化，三十岁以下的妇女已经清除了缠足恶习，有些在下地时，同男子一样打赤脚。
    最后，发动妇女参加农业生产劳动，应注意培养与提拔妇女干部。平定妇女生产工作做得较好，也正是因为他们新提拔了二十八个妇女干部，使妇女工作得到开展，并克服了某些干部不重视妇女工作的错误观点。
