[Xinhua News Agency, Beiping Radio Broadcast, 29th] Workers at the Shenyang Railway Factory held a grand meeting on the evening of the 24th to celebrate the departure of the meticulously repaired and equipped "Nanjing" locomotive to Nanjing. This is another contribution of the factory workers after refurbishing the "Beiping" and "Tianjin" locomotives. They are now rushing to repair the "Shanghai," "Wuhan," and "Guangzhou" locomotives as gifts for the liberation of Shanghai, Wuhan, and Guangzhou.

Furthermore, since the launch of the production and labor competition in various factories and stations within the Shenyang railway system, significant achievements have been made. The Bridge Factory's Mechanical Branch fulfilled its April production quota ahead of schedule on the 23rd. The Forging Branch of the Rolling Stock Factory completed 75% of its monthly task in just half a month. Huang Gutun Station did not experience a single train delay from the 21st of last month to the 20th of this month, with all trains arriving on time.

　　沈阳铁路工厂工人的贺礼
　  “南京号”已开往南京
    “上海号”和“广州号”正赶修待发
    【北平新华广播电台二十九日广播】沈阳铁路工厂工人，在二十四号晚上召开大会，欢送早已修好装设精致的“南京号”机车开到南京去。这是该厂工人在装修“北平”号和“天津号”两台机车后的又一贡献。现在他们正在赶修“上海号”、“武汉号”与“广州号”机车，作为将来上海、武汉、广州解放时的贺礼。
    又息：沈阳铁路系统各工厂、各站和各地展开生产劳动竞赛以来，已经得到很大成绩。桥梁工厂机械分厂四月份的生产任务已经在二十三号提前完成。车辆工厂锻冶分厂半个月就完成了全月任务的百分之七十五。黄姑屯车站从上月二十一号到本月二十号的三十天中没有一次列车误点，都是准时到站。
