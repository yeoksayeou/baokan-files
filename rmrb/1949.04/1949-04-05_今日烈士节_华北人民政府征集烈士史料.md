　　Today is Martyrs' Day
　　North China People's Government Collects Martyrs' Historical Materials
    [Reported by this newspaper] Today is the traditional Qingming Festival. The North China People's Government has designated it as Martyrs' Day and has issued a circular to collect materials on martyrs. The original text is as follows:
    Our revolutionary martyrs, in order to overthrow the rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism in China, and to build a new China, devoted themselves to the people, disregarding the sacrifice of their personal lives, advancing wave upon wave. Their great achievements are indelible. To provide learning for future generations, their relics and deeds should be collected, preserved, compiled, and passed down. In the past, due to long-term war and inconvenient transportation, it was difficult to collect information on the deeds of martyrs who worked underground. As a result, the deeds of many martyrs have been lost without a trace. Now that North China has been basically completely liberated, a special circular is issued to the entire region. All family members, relatives, friends, comrades, fellow sufferers of the martyrs, as well as their original work units, should be responsible for reporting in detail the names and deeds of the martyrs they know, and send them directly to this government or report them to this government through governments at all levels. Remains, relics, and writings worthy of commemoration are especially welcome. Once the investigation is accurate, those who have not been given condolences will be given retroactive condolences, and their families will enjoy preferential treatment as families of martyrs. The deeds of the individuals will be compiled and published, and the relics of the individuals will be handed over to the Martyrs' Cemetery for display and commemoration, in order to educate the broad masses of the people. In addition to issuing a circular for collection, governments at all levels and Martyrs' Cemeteries should also take the initiative to investigate in order to highlight the achievements of the martyrs.

　　今日烈士节
  　华北人民政府征集烈士史料
    【本报讯】今日为旧历清明节，华北人民政府规定为烈士节，顷特发出通令搜集烈士材料，原文如下：
    我革命烈士，为了推翻帝国主义、封建主义与官僚资本主义在中国的统治，建设新中国而献身人民，不恤牺牲个人之生命，前仆后继，其丰功伟迹，千古不磨，为资后人学习，其遗物事迹，应加搜集保存，编撰留传。过去以长期战争，交通不便，关于地下工作之烈士事迹搜集困难，至有许多烈士事迹，湮没无闻，现在华北已基本上全部解放，为此特通令全区，凡烈士家属亲友、同志、同难，以及其原属工作机关，均应负责对所知烈士姓名、事迹，详为申报，迳寄本府或各级政府转报本府。其有遗容、遗物、遗著，足资纪念者，尤为欢迎。一经调查确切，凡未抚恤者，当追予抚恤，其家属享受烈属优待。本人事迹编传刊布，本人遗物，交由烈士陵园陈列纪念，借以教育广大人民。除通令征集外，各级政府与烈士陵园，尤应主动调查，以彰先烈之功绩。
