Pingjin Railway Bureau Improves Workers' Welfare in Changxindian Based on Possible Conditions

[This newspaper report] The Pingjin Railway Bureau has been going into the lower levels to listen to the opinions of employees and solve the welfare problems of workers in Changxindian. After the liberation of Changxindian, due to the lack of thorough work by the leadership and neglect of the welfare of employees, problems such as "free Sunday rides into the city for workers," "investigation of wage arrears owed by the Kuomintang," and "overtime pay for workers in the locomotive section" were not resolved promptly and appropriately. Nor were the difficulties and reasons why it is not yet possible to quickly improve living standards and establish large-scale welfare programs explained to the workers, which once aroused dissatisfaction and suspicion among the workers. Some workers said to our cadres, "You only pay attention to production and not to welfare!" When the situation in various places was reported to the higher authorities, the Railway Bureau immediately held a meeting to conduct an inspection. On April 4th, Deputy Director Liu Jianzhang and Xu Ping, director of the Trade Union Preparatory Committee, personally went to Changxindian to hold a symposium with employee representatives to solicit workers' opinions. At that time, the representatives attending the meeting, in addition to reviewing the above-mentioned issues, also raised a number of suggestions for improvement regarding the unreasonable phenomena during the Kuomintang rule, such as "too many servants in staff dormitories wasting manpower," "technical workers being used as servants," "workers having no opportunity to learn," and the need to quickly adjust personnel and wages. After research by the Railway Bureau, at the general meeting of all employees in Changxindian on April 6th, Deputy Director Liu, on behalf of the Railway Bureau, conducted a self-criticism and made the following replies: (1) General free ride passes have been handled temporarily in accordance with the bureau's order of March 8th, as stipulated before liberation. The commuter train between Beiping and Changxindian for employees of this railway was opened at the end of March; for the sake of greater convenience, starting from April 1st, in addition to one round trip train per day on weekdays, three trains will be added on Sundays. No tickets are allowed on other train services to maintain train order. (2) The issue of wage arrears from the Kuomintang era will be investigated by representatives from the trade union to investigate the truth and assist the administration in handling it. (3) Servants in the original employee dormitories who need to work in the factory can be allowed to work after review. Technical workers currently serving as servants can be changed to workers after proof. Apprentices who have served for more than two years can be promoted to formal workers after passing an examination. (4) Those who used assumed names in the past can be changed to their real names with the approval of higher authorities, but those who replaced others during the liberation process are not allowed. Such phenomena should be avoided in the future. (5) Those who travel on business on Sundays will be issued overtime pay in addition to travel expenses. The calculation of crew fees based on time is not appropriate and it is planned to calculate them based on cumulative mileage. (6) Pensions for employees who die on duty will be implemented in accordance with the promulgated measures. If the immediate family members die and prove that the family is indeed in difficulty, the trade union can find ways to provide relief. (7) Everyone can raise any opinions on the original position and salary. If they are unreasonable, we will start to adjust them according to the bureau's adjustment methods. (8) The welfare coal for workers has not been resolved in time due to insufficient strength in the past. Now, half a ton per person will be issued first at the mountain price. (9) Those who are incompetent in personnel will be adjusted. (10) The public will pay for the purchase of glasses for those who burn oxygen in the machine shop. Issues concerning employee learning and cooperatives will be resolved separately. As a result, the employees were very satisfied and said, "Director Liu speaks so frankly! If we had explained it earlier, people would have been at ease!" In order to further strengthen ties with the working masses and strengthen the leadership of employee work, the Pingjin Railway Bureau has decided to convene a general meeting of employee representatives on the 20th of this month.

　　平津铁路局根据可能条件
  　改进长辛店工人福利
    【本报讯】平津铁路管理局，深入下层听取职工意见，解决长辛店工人福利问题。长辛店解放后，由于领导上工作不深入，忽视职工福利事业，致“工人星期天免费乘车进城”，“追查国民党欠薪”，“机务段工人加班费”等问题，均未及时的适当的解决。也没有将目前还不能很快改善生活及大量兴办福利的困难和原因，向工人进行解释，因此，一度引起工人的不满和怀疑。有的工人对我们干部说：“你们只重视生产，不注意福利”！当各地情况反映到上级，路局即召开会议进行检查。并于四月四日，由副局长刘建章，职工筹备会主任徐平亲至长辛店召开职工代表座谈会，征求工人意见，当时与会代表，除对上述问题进行检讨外，并对国民党统治时期，“职员宿舍杂役太多浪费人力”、“技术工人当杂役”、“工人没机会学习”等不合理现象，及对目前人事、工资需很快调整等提供若干改进意见。经路局研究后，于四月六日长辛店全体职工大会上，由刘副局长代表路局，进行自我检讨，并作如下答复：（一）一般的免费乘车证，已按三月八日局令暂照解放前规定办理，长辛店职工星期天乘车问题，北平长辛店间已于三月底为本路职工开通勤车；为了更便利起见，自四月一日起，除平时每日往返一辆外，星期日增为三辆，其他车次不得无票乘坐，以便维持列车次序。（二）国民党时代所欠工资问题，由职工会派代表负责调查真象，协助行政处理。（三）原职工宿舍杂役，需进厂作工者，可经过审查准其工作，有技术的工友现当杂役者，经过证明可改作工人。艺徒已经服务二年以上者，可以经过考试，升为正式工人。（四）过去顶名者，经上级批准可改为真名，但在解放过程中顶替者不准。今后应避免顶名现象发生。（五）星期日出差者，除发出差费外并发加班费。乘务费按时间计算不合适，拟按里程累进计算。（六）员工因公死亡之抚恤费，照已公布之办法执行。其直系家属死亡后，证明家庭确实困难者，职工会可设法救济。（七）对原职原薪大家有何意见可提出，不合理者，即着手按局内调整办法予以调整。（八）工人福利煤因过去力量不足，未及时解决，现每人按山价先发半吨。（九）人事不称职者，予以调整。（十）机厂烧氧气者公家出款买眼镜。关于对员工学习、合作社等问题，另作专题解决，由此，员工非常满意的说：“刘局长说的多干脆呀！要是早先解释一下，人们早安心啦”！为了进一步密切与工人群众的联系，加强职工工作的领导，平津铁路局决定于本月二十日召开全局职工代表会议。
