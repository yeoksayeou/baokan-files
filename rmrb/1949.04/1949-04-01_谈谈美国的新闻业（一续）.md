　　On American Journalism (Continued)
　　Huang Caoliang

　　For those newspapers and periodicals not directly owned by the big capitalists, the capitalists also have the means to control them through various methods. One of the main methods is advertising. American bourgeois newspapers primarily exist for profit, and advertising is the newspaper's biggest source of income. If you offend a large corporation, they, along with capitalists in the same group, can refuse to advertise with you, which spells the death of a newspaper. An American author, James Rorty, wrote a book called "Our Master's Voice: Advertising." It says: "More than seventy-five percent of the revenue of a modern American newspaper comes from advertising fees." In 1946, an American local newspaper editor told the Soviet writer Ehrenburg: "Our independent (!) newspaper is completely dependent on advertising. If we lose advertising, we cannot continue even for a week." Who advertises? The author of "1,000 Americans" says: "The total advertising expenditure in the United States is $2 billion a year, most of which comes from manufacturers of the ‘NAM’ [National Association of Manufacturers]." Another important method for big capitalists to control "public opinion" is to control writers, using both enticement and threats. Walter Lippmann, one of the main political commentators of American imperialism today, was a famous progressive journalist in the early 20th century. However, in the 1940s, after he traveled around the world on the yacht of Lamont, the Morgan capital kingdom's news agent, earning more than $50,000 a year and owning three houses, Lippmann turned to supporting the idea that "we are safe in the arms of Morgan." Hearst's "Good Housekeeping" magazine bluntly stated in 1946: "Magazines that can afford to pay the highest manuscript fees will not be afraid of not finding the best writers." The American writer Sargent said in his book "What Makes Lives": "Writers are controlled, books are privately censored... Mills's book 'The Road to War' had its parts about Morgan deleted before it was printed... Writers who were once bold and free are now careful, trying to avoid the interference they know will happen." Sargent said, "These are the trends of the times." Examples of threatening writers are also endless. The author of "1,000 Americans" pointed out that in 1946 and 1947, the broadcasting industry dismissed dozens of commentators. Statistics show that they were all "people who did not promote free enterprise and big business, that is, people who did not attack labor and did not despise the opinions of all liberals." If you can actually get through these difficulties and openly attack the capitalists, the capitalists will refuse to publish your works in the future, or buy out the publisher to stop publishing your works, or launch their "public opinion" forces to attack you, saying that you are an "extremist," a "red," an agent of Russia, etc. Their tidal wave of publications will declare war on you. How can you have the power to defend yourself? Like screenwriters, directors, and actors in Hollywood, anyone who has a conscience and dares to speak the truth about the United States will be summoned by the "House Un-American Activities Committee" and the "Federal Bureau of Investigation" (the US national intelligence agency). Even if they are finally acquitted, the newspapers and periodicals of the big capitalist groups have already colorfully spread your "crimes." Those who are affected have no way to defend themselves except to be unlucky.
　　Under such strict control of the news media and journalists by the major capitalist groups in the United States, what kind of "free speech" and "objective reporting" is American journalism instilling in the American people? First of all, it is instilling in the people various reactionary views and fabricated "opinions" that only conform to the interests of American big capitalists and American imperialism, and are harmful to the American people and the people of the world. This includes anti-labor, anti-democracy, anti-reform, anti-socialism, anti-Soviet Union, propaganda of fascism, propaganda of wars of aggression, and so on. For example, when the Wagner Act, which was beneficial to labor, was enacted in 1935 during the Roosevelt era, most of the American news media nervously mobilized to slander and oppose the act. For ten years, "not a day went by without broadcasts, news reports, headlines, and editorials attacking the Wagner Act. The New York Times published an average of twelve editorials a year advocating changes to this law" ("1,000 Americans"). The obstruction of the St. Lawrence Seaway project is another example. From Wilson to the current US President Truman, six presidents have approved the construction of the St. Lawrence Seaway project. President Roosevelt said in his 1941 message to Congress: "I know that in peacetime or wartime, no such design is more important to the future of the United States than this." However, the "public opinion" of all monopolists related to large electric power companies immediately mobilized to oppose this plan, because it would lower electricity rates and reduce the profits of large capitalists. As a result, this plan has been shelved. For example, Warner, the chairman of the aforementioned National Association of Manufacturers and chairman of the Publishers Association, wrote in his 1937 plan: "Today, the success or failure of a strike depends more on newspapers and radio broadcasts than in the past. The support or opposition of public opinion is an important factor in labor disputes" ("1,000 Americans"). The American bourgeois press talks about "the public" and "the public interest" all the time, but the above facts prove that these newspapers are thoroughly violating the public interest and only follow the interests of the big capitalists.

　　谈谈美国的新闻业（一续）
    黄操良
    对于那些不直接为大资本家们所有的报纸和刊物，资本家们也有经过种种方法加以控制的把握。其中主要的一个方法是登广告。美国资产阶级的报刊首先都是为了利润，广告是报纸的最大收入。如果你得罪了大公司，他们，再联合同一集团的资本家拒绝向你登广告，这就宣布了一个报刊的死刑。有一位美国作者詹姆士·洛提作了一本书，书名就叫做“我们主人底声音：广告”。这上面说：“现代美国报纸收入的百分之七十五以上，系来自广告费用。”一九四六年一位美国地方报纸编者向苏联作家爱伦堡说：“我们的独立（！）报纸，是完全靠着广告的，如果失去广告，我们连一星期也继续不下去。”谁登广告呢？“一千个美国人”的作者说：“全美国一年的广告费用为二十万万美元，其中大部分都来自‘制协’的制造商”。大资本家们控制“舆论”的另一个重要方法，是控制作家，利诱和威胁双管齐下。今天美国帝国主义主要政论家之一的李普曼，二十世纪初时曾是一个著名的进步新闻记者，可是在四十年代，当他乘了摩根资本王国新闻方面代理人拉孟特的游艇周游世界，每年可以赚五万元以上的收入并拥有三座房子之后，李普曼便转而拥护“我们在摩根的怀中是安全的”那种思想了。赫斯特系的“好家政”杂志一九四六年时曾露骨地说：“能够具有付出最高稿费的能力，杂志就不怕找不到最好的作家。”美国作家沙金特在他的“什么造成生命”一书中曾说：“作家被控制了，书籍受到私人检查………密里斯的‘走向战争之路’一书在未印行前，其中关于和摩根有关的部分便被删除了，……一度大胆而自由的作家们，现在小心翼翼，竭力避免他们知道要发生的干涉。”沙金特说：“这些都是时代的趋势。”威胁作家的例子也层出不穷。“一千个美国人”的作者指出，一九四六年和一九四七年，广播界辞退了几十个评论员，统计结果，他们全部是“不曾替自由企业和大企业宣传的人，也就是不曾攻击劳工和不曾轻视一切自由分子意见的人”。如果你居然能透过这些难关而公然攻击资本家的时候，资本家们以后就拒绝发表你的作品，或者收买出版社停止发行你的作品，或者发动他们的“舆论”力量向你进攻，说你是“过激分子”，“赤党”，俄国的代理人等等，他们的潮水似的出版物一齐向你宣战，你那有力量去为自己辩护？象好莱坞影城这样的电影剧本作者、导演和演员，凡有良心敢说出美国的真实的，都要被“非美活动委员会”和“联邦调查局”（美国国家特务机关）传讯，就算最后得到无罪开释，但是大资本家集团的报纸和刊物早已有声有色地把你的“罪状”传布开了，身受的人除了倒霉以外，简直没有自卫的办法。
    在美国大资本集团对新闻事业和记者作家们这样严密的控制下，美国的新闻业向美国人民灌输的是些什么样的“自由言论”和“客观报道”呢？首先就是向人民灌输各种仅仅符合于美国大资本家和美国帝国主义的利益，而有害于美国人民和世界人民的各种反动观点和捏造的“舆论”。这就是反劳工、反民主、反改革、反社会主义、反苏联、宣传法西斯、宣传侵略战争等等。例如，当罗斯福时代一九三五年有利于劳工的华格纳法案成立后，美国新闻机关的绝大部分，就紧张地动员起来进行诬蔑和反对这个法案的工作，十年来，“没有一天没有广播、新闻、标题、社评攻击华格纳法案。纽约时报平均每年发表十二篇社评，主张改变这项法令”。（“一千个美国人”）圣罗连斯河水利计划的被阻是另一个例子。自威尔逊至现任美国总统杜鲁门中经六任总统，都曾批准过建设圣罗连斯河水利的计划。罗斯福总统一九四一年致国会的咨文说：“我知道在平时或战时，这类的设计没有一个比它对于美国的未来更重要的。”但是一切与大电力公司有关的垄断资本家们的“舆论”立刻动员起来反对这个计划，因为这会使得电费降低，减少大资本家们的利润。这样，这个计划就一直被搁置着。又如，上述的制造家协会主席兼出版人协会主席华纳，在他的一九三七年计划书中写着：“今日罢工胜负成败之决定于报纸及无线电广播，尤甚于往日。舆论的向背，乃是劳工纠纷中的重要因素。”（“一千个美国人”）美国资产阶级的新闻界开口闭口都是“公众”和“公众利益”这类的好字眼，但上述事实证明这些报业是澈头澈尾地违反公众利益，而只遵循大资本家们的利益办事的。
