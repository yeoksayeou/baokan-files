　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 23rd: The Nehru ruling clique of India is further selling out Indian sovereignty and interests. Under the direction of U.S. and British imperialism, they are intensifying activities among reactionary elements in Southeast Asian satellite and colonial countries, preparing to organize an anti-communist, anti-people "Asian Group." According to Agence France-Presse, Nehru left India for England on the 19th to attend the British Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference. He said in Cairo on the 20th, "The Asian Conference will soon become a formal, permanent institution." The so-called Asian Conference was convened by Nehru with the sponsorship of the United States, and its purpose is to unite reactionary elements from various Asian countries to form an "Asian Group." Nehru had repeatedly denied this in the past, but now he has admitted it without being forced. At the same time, Indian Air Force Commander-in-Chief Mukerjee left for the United States on the 19th to participate in the Indian "Defense Mission." This mission departed earlier this month, and its purpose is to visit the United States, Britain, Canada, Germany, and other countries to establish closer military ties with the imperialist bloc. Nehru recently said shamelessly, "India is the natural center of the new Asian situation." This means that he wants to turn India into an imperialist base for attacking the people of the Far East. Nehru convened the second meeting of the "Asian Group" on the 13th to discuss helping the Thakin Nu government suppress the Burmese revolutionary movement, and demanded that India and other countries mediate the struggle for power and profit between Thakin Nu and the upper echelons of the Karen people. Nehru also sent the Indian Foreign Minister to Burma, Malaya, Siam, Vietnam, and other places for a three-week visit to promote his reactionary "Southeast Asian policy."
　　
　　As Nehru acts as a lackey of imperialism, he intensifies the selling out of Indian interests. He made a statement in the Indian Parliament on the 6th, welcoming foreign investment and announcing policies to protect foreign enterprises in India. This was praised by U.S. officials. A U.S. official in Washington said on the 11th that India is the "most satisfactory place" for the United States to invest in backward regions. Recent news indicates that the "Indo-U.S. Friendship and Commerce Treaty" is under negotiation.
　　
　　In order to cover up his reactionary behavior, Nehru has repeatedly claimed in Congress, press conferences, and other public occasions this month that the Indian government will adopt a so-called "middle" and "mediatory" policy between the world's two major hostile camps, and will not participate in the North Atlantic Treaty and the Pacific Treaty. In response, the Central Committee of the Indian Communist Party stated in a statement: "The Indian government's statement on a neutral and independent foreign policy is a smokescreen aimed at covering up India's joining the aggressive war camp headed by U.S. and British imperialism. The Indian people resolutely oppose this act of 'betraying Indian interests.'"

### 美帝鹰犬尼赫鲁  招认筹组“亚洲集团”  印共声明坚决反对

　　美帝鹰犬尼赫鲁
    招认筹组“亚洲集团”
    印共声明坚决反对
    【新华社北平二十三日电】印度尼赫鲁统治集团，正进一步出卖印度主权和利益；并在美英帝国主义指使之下，加紧在东南亚各附庸国和殖民地国家的反动分子中进行活动，筹组反共反人民的“亚洲集团”。据法新社消息，尼赫鲁于十九日离印赴英，参加英联邦总理会议。他在二十日经过开罗时发表谈话说：“亚洲会议不久将成为正式的永久机构。”所谓亚洲会议是由美国赞助下由尼赫鲁召集的，其目的就在联合亚洲各国反动分子组成“亚洲集团”。过去尼赫鲁一再否认这点，而现在已经不打自招。与此同时，印空军总司令慕寇吉已于十九日赴美，将参加印度的“国防使团”，这个使团是在本月上旬出发的，目的在分访美、英、加、德等国，与帝国主义集团建立更加密切的军事联系。尼赫鲁最近曾大言不惭地说：“印度乃新亚洲局势中的当然中心。”这就是说，他要把印度变为帝国主义进攻远东各国人民的中心基地。尼赫鲁在十三日召开了“亚洲集团”的第二次会议，讨论帮助达钦努政府镇压缅甸革命运动，并要求由印度等国来调解达钦努与克仑族上层分子间争权夺利的斗争。尼赫鲁还派遣印外长赴缅甸、马来亚、暹罗、越南等作三周访问，以推进他的反动的“东南亚政策。”    尼赫鲁既充当帝国主义鹰犬，便更加紧出卖印度利益。他六日在印议会发表声明，欢迎外人投资，并宣布了保护外人在印企业的政策。这获得美国官方的赞扬。花盛顿美官员十一日说，印度乃美国对落后地区投资的“最美满地”。最近消息，“印美友好及通商条约”已在谈判中。    为了掩饰他的反动行为，尼赫鲁本月以来曾在国会、记者招待会及其他公开场合，一再佯称印度政府将在世界两大敌对阵营中，采取所谓“中间”和“调解”的政策，不参加北大西洋公约和太平洋公约。对此，印共中央委员会已在声明中指出：“印度政府关于中立和独立外交政策的声明，是一种烟幕，旨在掩盖印度加入以美英帝国主义为首的侵略战争陈营，印度人民坚决反对这种‘背叛印度利益’的行为。”
