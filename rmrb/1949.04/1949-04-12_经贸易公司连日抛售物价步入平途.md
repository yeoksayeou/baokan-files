Following the trade company's continuous sales, the market prices in the city for grains, cloth, and other goods have become increasingly stable under the suppression of the trade company's continuous sales. The market conditions for various goods are also entering a stable phase. On the 11th, although the company continued to sell food grains and cloth in the grain and cloth markets, speculators mostly hesitated to move forward. Only over 700,000 jin of food grains were sold, and only 320 bags of flour were sold. The amount of food grains sold was half of the previous day (the 10th). Compared with the sales volume of the 10th, the sales of flour decreased by a huge amount of more than 2,500 bags. In addition, the company sold 31 pieces of cotton cloth and 3 pieces of 10-count all-cotton yarn on the 11th. The sales volume also decreased compared with the 10th, because market supply and demand have gradually become normal.

　　经贸易公司连日抛售
  　物价步入平途
    【本报讯】本市粮布等市场在贸易公司连日抛货抑制下愈显平静，各货行情亦步入平途，十一日该公司虽然继续在粮布两市场售卖食粮和纱布，但投机商已多裹是不前，食粮仅售出七十余万斤，面粉仅卖出三百二十袋，食粮售出量较前日（十日）减一半。面粉与十日售出量相较，竟差二千五百余袋之巨，另该公司十一日售卖之棉布计三十一件，十支十全纱三支，售出量亦较十日减少。因市场供求已渐趋正常。
