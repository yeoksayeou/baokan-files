(Ji Lu Yu Telegram) The purely task-oriented viewpoint in leadership caused the phenomena of reduced quality and wasted materials during the crash printing of textbooks at the Ji Lu Yu Hebei Xinhua Bookstore in late February. In the binding room during the crash campaign, 3,000 sheets with irregular paste patterns were found; the materials room issued 4,000 blank sheets of paper. In one month, over 7,000 copies of waste paper were used. At the same time, all meetings in the factory were suspended during the crash, and the leadership did not correct this in time. However, it cannot be denied that the Party members and Youth League members in the factory played a leading role in the movement. Due to the promotion of Party member Li Peichang, Youth League member Wang Hanping, and others in the printing work, an unprecedented record of printing 12,000 impressions per shift was achieved. Although the Youth League in the factory was established not long ago, the members have shown a high degree of enthusiasm in their work: Youth League member Wang Hanping was originally a third-class first-level printing worker, but as a result of carefully studying technology, his printing output has caught up with that of second-class workers; Youth League member and binding female worker Du Guilan, during the movement, increased her speed from folding 800 pages per hour to 1,000, and even 1,400 pages. When the factory received the Xinhua General Store's notice against anarchism and lack of discipline, it immediately conducted a comprehensive inspection, recognized the above-mentioned bias caused by the purely task-oriented viewpoint, and then, the factory director made a report based on the factory management committee's strict system and other decisions. After discussion and deliberation by the entire factory, the staff unanimously believed that without a strict system, it would be impossible to improve technology, quantity, and quality. Since then, the work has greatly improved. Not only has the output not decreased, but the quality has also improved compared to before: Within two weeks after the meeting, Li Peichang and Wang Hanping only ruined one sheet of paper, and each shift ruined a maximum of 40 sheets, which is a significant reduction compared to the 50 sheets a month ago; the machine room's work had never been praised before, but recently everyone agreed that the printing from the machine room was much better.

　　克服生产竞赛偏向保证质量高省材料
  　新华书厂正确发挥工人积极性
    【冀鲁豫电】领导上的单纯任务观点，造成了冀鲁豫河北新华书厂二月下旬突击印刷课本中所发生的质量降低、浪费材料的现象。装订房在突击运动中，检查出糊花不规矩的页子三千张；材料房发空了四千张纸。一个月来印坏、支空所浪费的毛头纸共七千多份。与此同时，该厂在突击中一切会议都停顿了，而领导上并未及时纠正。但，不可抹煞的是该厂党员、青年团员们在运动中所起的带头作用，由于党员李培常、团员王汉平等在印刷工作中的推动作用，每班达到印一万二千印的空前纪录。该厂青年团虽建立不久，但团员已在工作中发挥了高度的积极性：团员王汉平原是三等一级印刷工人，但他以精心钻研技术的结果，印书产量已赶上二等工人；青年团员装订女工杜桂兰，在运动中由每小时折八百页的速度提高到一千、甚至一千四百页。当该厂接到新华总店的反无政府无纪律的通知后，立即进行了全面检查，认识了单纯任务观点所造成的上述偏向，继之，厂长又根据工厂管理委员会严格制度等决定作了报告，经全厂讨论酝酿后，职工一致认为：不严格制度，是不能提高技术、数量与质量的。此后，工作大有改进，不仅产量未降低，且质量也较前有所提高：会后两星期内，李培常、王汉平只印坏一张页子，每班最多印坏四十张，较之月前的五十张已大为减少；机器房的工作以前从未得过表扬，但近来大家一致认为机器房印刷的真好多了。
