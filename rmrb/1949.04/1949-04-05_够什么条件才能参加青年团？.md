　　What qualifications are needed to join the Communist Youth League?

To the Editor:
    I am a student at ×× Middle School. Recently, the New Democratic Youth League launched a membership drive at school, and many students are vying to apply. This enthusiasm for revolution makes me very envious. For the past few days, I have been preparing to submit an application to the school branch, but I have a few questions that I would like answered:
    1. What qualifications do I need to join the New Democratic Youth League?
    2. Can young people from other democratic parties who are willing to dedicate themselves to the revolution and strive for the cause of New Democracy also join the League?
    3. How is the probationary period for joining the League calculated?

　　　　　　　Reader Wang Yi

Comrade Wang Yi:
    The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China made detailed instructions in the resolution on the establishment of the League and the draft League Constitution this year. Please refer to them. Here, we will only provide a simple answer:
    1. According to Article 4 of the draft League Constitution: Any young man or woman between the ages of fifteen and twenty-five who supports the proposals of the Communist Party of China, is willing to actively strive for the cause of the New Democratic revolution, is willing to loyally serve the working people, recognizes the League Constitution, abides by the resolutions, and participates in the work of the League, can apply to join the League. Therefore, anyone who meets the above conditions can join the League. However, the Youth League does not require members to meet the standards of Communist Party members; nor does it indiscriminately absorb members.
    2. The New Democratic Youth League is a mass organization of advanced young people who are resolutely fighting for the realization of New Democracy under the leadership of the Communist Party of China. Therefore, all members of democratic parties or leagues who are progressive young people who approve of the Youth League program and abide by the League Constitution can join the League, but they must declare their party affiliation to the Youth League organization before joining.
    3. The probationary period for joining the League varies depending on the family background, social status, political consciousness, and ideological awareness of the member. For example, young people from social strata other than working youth, revolutionary intellectual youth, revolutionary soldiers, and revolutionary staff generally have a probationary period of three to six months. Those who have left reactionary parties, factions, societies, and groups generally have a probationary period of six months to one year, subject to certain procedures.

To the Editor:
    During the League establishment movement at ×× School this time, I was an enthusiastic applicant, but as a result, I was not accepted because of my previous solitary nature, lack of contact with the masses, and many ideological burdens. These last two days I have been in a very bad mood and my thinking is a little confused; my desire to make progress is very urgent, but I was not able to join this time. Can I apply again in the future? What if I can't pass again? Please reply to me, Comrade.

　　　Student Li Zhi, ×× Girls' Middle School

Comrade Li Zhi:
    Since you eagerly hope to come into the embrace of the Youth League to receive the League's education, this enthusiasm for progress is very good. Since you were not approved by the masses this time, you should work harder, learn from the masses, correct your past style of separating from the masses, and establish a worldview of serving the people. Even if you cannot join the organization temporarily, as long as you work hard, you can achieve ideological progress, so there is no need to be troubled by this. If you make progress, even if you don't apply, the League members will ask you to join!

### 够什么条件才能参加青年团？

专栏：询问与答复

　　够什么条件才能参加青年团？编辑同志：
    我是××中学的学生，最近新民主主义青年团在校内展开建团运动，很多同学都争先恐后的自动要求参加，这种向往革命的热情使我很羡慕，几天来我正预备向校支部提出要求，可是有几个问题，请予解答：
    一、我参加新民主主义青年团，要够什么资格才行呢？
    二、其他民主党派的青年，愿献身革命为新民主主义事业而奋斗，这种人是否也可入团？
    三、入团的候补期是怎样计算的？
    　　　　　　　读者　王毅王毅同志：
    你所提问题，在今年元旦中共中央对建团决议及团章草案中已有详细指示，请参考。这里，我们仅做一简单答复：
    一、根据团章草案第四条规定：凡年在十五岁以上，二十五岁以下的男女青年，拥护中国共产党的主张，愿为新民主主义的革命事业积极奋斗，愿为劳动人民忠诚服务，承认团章，服从决议，参加团的工作者，皆可申请入团。因此，凡符合以上条件者均可入团，不过，青年团既不是以共产党员的标准其要求团员；也不是“不择对象”的滥吸收团员。
    二、新民主主义青年团是在中国共产党领导下坚决为实现新民主主义而斗争的先进青年们的群众性的组织，所以一切民主党派的党员或盟员，凡是赞成青年团纲领和服从团章的进步青年，皆可入团，但在入团之前须向青年团组织声明自己的党派关系。
    三、入团的候补期，是以团员的家庭出身、社会成份及其政治觉悟、思想意识等的不同而各有区别，例如除了劳动青年、革命知识青年、革命军人、革命职员等以外其他社会成份的青年入团，一般的须有三个月至六个月的候补期，脱离反动党、派、社、团的一般人员，除经一定手续外，须有半年至一年的候补期。编辑同志：
    这次××校建团运动中，我是积极申请入团的一个，可是结果，因为我以往性情孤癖不接近群众，同时思想包袱多，没有被通过。这两天我情绪非常不好，思想上有一点搞不通；我要求进步的心十分迫切，可是这次未得加入，以后是否还可以申请呢？如果再不能通过怎么办？请同志千万答复我。
    　　　第×女中学生李之李之同志：
    既然你急切地希望到青年团的怀抱里来受团的教育，这种要求进步的热诚是很好的，既然这次没被群众通过，那就更应该奋发努力，向群众学习，改正过去脱离群众的作风，树立为人民服务的人生观。虽说暂时不能加入组织，只要自己努力也能求得思想上的进步，不必为此苦恼。如果自己进步了，即便你没申请，团员们也会找你参加哩！
