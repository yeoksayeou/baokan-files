[Report from this newspaper] The North China Trade Company's Beijing branch, in close cooperation with the Tianjin Trade Company, fought shoulder-to-shoulder against speculative merchants to combat profiteers, suppress rising prices, and stabilize the prices of major commodities such as grain and cloth. The rampant price increases of the past two days were finally quelled on the 10th. On the 7th of this month, the price of Tianjin cloth turned upward under the manipulation and instigation of speculative merchants. Profiteers in Beijing also took the opportunity to become active, attempting to stir up trouble and seek exorbitant profits. Erchang Hong Wu Fu cloth rose from 4,450 yuan (7th price) to 4,720 yuan (9th price), and Green Sunshine cloth rose from 4,400 yuan (7th price) to 4,570 yuan (8th price), a daily increase of about 4 percent. In order to stabilize prices and protect the people's livelihood, the Beijing Trade Company's department store branch sold more than 1,580 pieces of various cloths at appropriate prices in the market on the 9th and 10th. At the same time, various cotton cloths were sold in the retail department to meet the needs of citizens and organizations for making summer clothes. As a result, cloth prices turned stable, and the profiteers suffered severe blows. Many small merchants who blindly followed the speculators also suffered losses. After their failure, the speculators and runners (i.e., brokers) spread rumors such as "The trade company doesn't have much cloth" and "The procedures for buying cloth from the trade company are too cumbersome," but they did not reverse their failure. In the grain market, there was a rush to buy on the morning of the 9th, but after the trade company announced unlimited sales, the market atmosphere calmed down. Yesterday (the 10th), the residual power of the speculators had not yet dissipated. The initial asking price for flour was as high as 1,900 yuan (the transaction price was 1,800 yuan); the trade company, based on market conditions, first posted a price of 1,750 yuan, and then lowered it to 1,700 yuan. When the price of Tong flour was reduced to 1,650 yuan, the merchants' morale was already frustrated. When the trade company posted the final price of 1,620 yuan, very few transactions were made. The merchants who bought at high prices, because they lost money on the spot, begged the trade company to return the goods. According to the company's statistics, a total of 2,605,600 jin of various grains and 3,100 bags of flour were sold in the four days from the 7th to the 10th. Judging from the closing situation yesterday (the 10th), the grain market has begun to move towards a lower path, and the speculative merchants who have not changed their bad habits have suffered another setback. In order to suppress this price increase, the Beijing Trade Company continued to sell grain and cloth during the bank holidays on Saturday afternoon and Sunday.

[Another report] In order to stabilize the market and take care of the interests of legitimate merchants, the department store has posted prices for large-scale sales of yarn and cloth in the yarn and cloth market. Yesterday (the 10th), the department store posted: Ten-yard Shiquan yarn 1,900 yuan, Hongguang brand yarn 4,170 yuan. In the afternoon, the price of Erchang Hong Wu Fu cloth was reduced from 4,500 yuan to 4,150 yuan, Baoli brand cloth from 4,050 yuan to 4,000 yuan, and Green Sunshine from 4,400 yuan to 4,380 yuan. A total of 820 pieces of cloth were sold, stabilizing the price of yarn and cloth. According to the company, it will continue to sell in large quantities at low prices in a planned way to supply workers and citizens with spring clothing materials in order to maintain the stability of yarn and cloth prices.

  　低价抛售粮布
  　打击奸商平稳物价
    【本报讯】华北贸易公司北平分公司为了打击投机奸商，抑止涨风，稳定粮布等主要商品价格，与天津贸易公司密切配合，并肩与投机商人作战，终于使二日来汹涌的涨风在十日宣告平息。本月七日，天津纱布在投机商人操纵煽动下，行情曾转向高途。北平的投机商人也借机活跃，企图兴风作浪，谋取暴利。二厂红五福布由四千四百五十元（七日价）升至四千七百二十元（九日价），绿阳光布由四千四百元（七日价）升至四千五百七十元（八日价），一日间上涨约百分之四。北平贸易公司的百货分公司为稳定物价，保障人民生活，九、十两天内在市场上以适当价格抛出了各种布匹一千五百八十余匹，同时并在门市部出售各种棉布，以供市民及机关团体制做夏服之需。这一来，布价转向平稳，奸商们遭到严重的打击，盲目追随投机商的小商人们也有许多跟着吃了亏。投机商和跑合的（即经纪人）在失败之后，散布：“贸易公司没有多少布”和“买贸易公司的布手续太繁琐”等谣言，也没有挽回其失败。在粮食市场上，九日清晨，曾一度发生抢购现象，但经贸易公司宣布无限制售卖后，市气即趋于平静。昨天（十日）投机商余威未除，面粉市价最初喊价高达一千九百元（成交为一千八百元）；贸易公司根据市场情况，首先挂出了一千七百五十元牌价，随后降至一千七百元。通粉牌价降到一千六百五十元时，商人心气已见挫。在贸易公司挂出最后牌价一千六百二十元时，成交的数量就很少了。用高价买进的商人们，因为当场赔了钱，又哀求贸易公司给他们退货。根据该公司统计，七至十日四天内共售出各种粮食二百六十万五千六百斤，面粉三千一百袋。以昨日（十日）收市的情况看，粮食行情，已开始步向低途，劣性不改的投机商人，又吃了一次苦头。北平贸易公司为了抑止此次涨风，在星期六下午和星期日银行休假期间依然继续出售粮布。
