　　Handan Jiuda Manager Greedy and Cunning
  　Illegally Deducts and Reduces Wages
  　Workers Demand a Reasonable Solution
    [Our Newspaper] Handan City private Jiuda Cotton Weaving Factory manager Dou Qingming, taking advantage of workers' eagerness to find employment, illegally withholds workers' wages and uses deceptive methods to lower wage amounts and convert wages into rice at a low price, treating workers extremely harshly. According to Jiuda (formerly Jiuyi), since it started operation in July last year, eleven employees have generated a profit of 20,900 RMB in three months during August, September and October. At the end of December, Jiuyi manager Chen Dengdi transferred the business to Dou Qingming through personal connections and changed the name to Jiuda. When Dou took over, the original workers remained unchanged, but he falsely reported "Jiuyi's closure" to conceal it from the labor union and dismissed four apprentices. He also shut down the factory last year, and workers returned home. After workers' requests and the labor union's notification, Dou personally promised the employees that all wages from the previous year would be paid in full. However, on December 27th of last year, he told the workers, "Business is not good. If everyone is still together next year, let me give you some pocket money now!" As a result, technicians who earned 130 jin of millet received 400 RMB; others received 300 or 200 RMB; the least amount was 110 RMB. Dou did not mention settling the wages, and the workers thought it was just a gift from the manager, so they did not bring it up. At that time, the price of rice was very high, equivalent to 18 RMB per jin. Dou also decided at the time that work would resume on February 15th of this year (i.e., this year). When the workers came to the factory as scheduled, Dou said again, "Come back on the 25th!" The workers came again on the 25th, but work still did not resume. Dou then used methods such as "using less rice to make thin porridge and adding more salt to the pickles," attempting to starve the workers away. The workers had no choice but to return home a second time. When work resumed on March 5th, Dou pointed out, "Without reducing wages, the factory cannot open." The workers, eager to find employment, had to reluctantly agree. The original wage of 130 jin was reduced to 85 jin, some to 80 jin, and apprentices to 30 jin. In addition, when the southward People's Liberation Army passed through Handan, all employees in the city collectively welcomed them for half a day. Dou said, "Work was delayed, less cloth was woven," and made the workers make up for the work. However, the labor-management agreement stipulated that there would be one day of rest every half month and that living conditions would be improved once a week, but Dou did not implement these provisions. The wages from last year have been withheld for more than three months and still have not been paid. When the workers raised the issue, the cunning Dou Qingming proposed to pay them according to the current rice price. The workers had no choice but to make another concession, agreeing to settle the account at the current rice price of 10 RMB per jin. However, the greedy Dou Qingming wanted to reduce the workers' original wages to 70 jin and pay them according to the current rice price. At this point, the workers could no longer tolerate this illegal and unreasonable exploitation and reported the matter to the city's labor union and the city's industry and commerce bureau, demanding a solution.

　　邯郸久大经理贪婪诡诈
  　非法克扣减低工资
  　工人要求合理解决
    【本报讯】邯郸市私营久大棉织厂经理窦清明，利用职工急于就业，非法扣押职工的工资，并以欺骗蔽办法，压低工资数目，贱价折合工资米，对待职工极刻薄。按久大（前为久益）自去年七月开工，职工十一人，于八、九、十三个月中即营利人民币二万零九百元。十二月底久益经理陈登第以私人关系转给窦清明经营，改号久大。窦经手时，工人原班未动，，但却假报“久益歇业”隐瞒工会，而解雇徒工四人，并于旧年停工，工人回家。经工人要求、工会的通知，窦某亲向职工允许把旧年前工资一律开支清楚；但到旧年十二月二十七日却向职工说：“买卖不好，明年大伙还在一块，现在给你们点零用吧！”结果，挣一百三十斤小米的技工给了四百元；其余有三百的，有二百的；最少的给了一百一十元。窦未提清算工资的事，职工们也以为这不过是经理的馈送，也没提。当时米价正贵，每斤合人民币十八元。窦当时并决定：明年（即今年）二月十五日开工。工人如期来厂后，窦却又说：“二十五日再来吧！”工人二十五日又来了，但仍不开工。窦则用“少下米做稀饭，咸菜里再加盐”的办法，企图饿走工人。工人们不得不二次又回去。三月五日开工时，窦指出：“不减工资，工厂开不了门。”工人为急于就业，只好被迫答应了。原工资一百三十斤的减到八十五斤，有的减为八十斤，徒工三十斤。此外南下大军过邯郸时，全市职工集体欢迎了半日，窦说：“误了工，少织了布”，而让工人补工。但劳资规约上的规定：半月休息一天，一星期改善一次生活，窦却不执行。去年的工资，扣押了三个多月一直还是不给，职工们提出来了，奸滑的窦清明却又提出按现在米价发给。工人们不得已又作了让步，同意按现在的米价每斤十元合帐，贪婪成性的窦清明，却又要把职工的原工资减到七十斤，并按现在的米价开支，至此，职工们再也不能忍耐这种非法无理的剥削，便报告该市职工会和市工商局要求解决。（苏幼民）
