Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 8th: Nationalist Navy and Air Force personnel who rose up sent a telegram to Chairman Mao Zedong of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Commander-in-Chief Zhu De of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and CPC peace talk representatives Zhou Enlai, etc., endorsing the CPC's eight-point peace proposal. The telegram reads as follows:

Respected Chinese People's Leader Chairman Mao, Chinese People's Liberation Army Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and CPC Peace Talk Representatives Zhou Enlai, Lin Boqu, Lin Biao, Ye Jianying, Li Weihan, Nie Rongzhen:

As CPC representatives and representatives of the reactionary, traitorous Nanjing Nationalist government are holding peace talks, we hereby reiterate to you: We firmly support Chairman Mao's eight-point peace proposal. We believe that Chairman Mao's proposal represents the opinions of the Chinese people, and also represents the opinions of us, the former Nationalist Navy and Air Force personnel who have risen up, and patriotic elements who are still temporarily in the Nationalist Navy and Air Force. Representatives of our Navy and Air Force uprising personnel held a forum, denouncing the bloody crimes of US imperialism colluding with the Nationalist reactionaries to launch a cruel civil war and massacre the Chinese people, as well as the incident of bombing and destroying the Chongqing warship. We unanimously demand that war criminals be severely punished and that responsibility for the Chongqing warship destruction incident be investigated. In the past, we were forced to participate in the anti-people war. The facts we have personally experienced tell us that the responsibility for destroying the nation's vitality and massacring the Chinese people should be borne by the war criminals. The peace clamored for by the war criminals is false. After the number one war criminal Chiang Kai-shek "stepped down," they still openly called on the Nationalist Navy, Army, and Air Force to prepare for war. Therefore, only by fully and thoroughly implementing Chairman Mao's eight peace conditions can true peace be achieved. If the reactionary, traitorous Nanjing Nationalist government does not thoroughly implement Chairman Mao's eight peace conditions in this peace negotiation, then, under the leadership of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, we will work together with the People's Liberation Army, each doing our duty, and resolutely fight to the end to completely eliminate all reactionary forces and liberate all of China.

　　起义的国民党海空军人员
  　电毛主席朱总司令
    愿为消灭反动势力而奋斗
    【新华社北平八日电】起义的巡洋舰重庆号海军官兵及参加人民解放军的空军人员致电中共中央毛泽东主席、中国人民解放军朱德总司令、中共和谈代表周恩来等，拥护中共八项和平主张。电文如下：
    中国人民领袖毛主席、中国人民解放军朱总司令暨中共和谈代表周恩来、林伯渠、林彪、叶剑英、李维汉、聂荣臻诸先生：
    当兹中共代表与南京国民党反动卖国政府的代表举行和平谈判之际，我们特向你们再次表明：我们是坚决拥护毛主席的八项和平主张的。我们认为毛主席的主张是代表了中国人民的意见，也代表了我们起义的前国民党海、空军人员及现在仍暂时留在国民党海、空军内的爱国分子的意见。我们海空军起行人员的代表举行了座谈会，控诉了美帝国主义勾结国民党反动派发动残酷的内战，屠杀中国人民的血腥罪行及此次炸毁重庆号事件，我们一致要求严惩战争罪犯，并追究炸毁重庆号事件的责任。过去我们曾被迫参加过反人民的战争，我们亲身体验过的事实告诉我们：毁坏国家元气，屠杀中国人民的责任，应该由战争罪犯来担负。战争罪犯们所叫嚣的和平是假的。他们在第一号战犯蒋介石“引退”之后，还公开号召国民党海、陆、空军准备战争。因此，只有全部彻底实行毛主席的八项和平条件，才能获得真正的和平。如果南京国民党反动卖国政府，在这次和平谈判中不彻底实行毛主席八项和平条件，那么，在毛主席、朱总司令领导之下，我们将要和人民解放军一起，各尽职责，为彻底消灭一切反动势力，为解放全中国而坚决奋斗到底。
