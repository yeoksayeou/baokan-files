　　[Our Newspaper's Report] In accordance with the principles of thrift and disaster prevention, production for self-salvation, mutual assistance among the masses, and work-for-grain compensation, the Taihang, Ji-Lu-Yu, Ji'nan, and Chahar regions of North China are vigorously organizing the masses in disaster areas to overcome the spring famine, so as to ensure the victorious launch of this year's large-scale production campaign. Several border areas of the North China Liberated Area have suffered greatly from the devastation by the Chiang bandits in the past, coupled with drought, floods, breaches of river and lake dikes, and insect pests, and many have become disaster areas. These include counties such as Xiuwu, Huojia, Jiaozuo, Wuzhi, Xingtai, Lincheng, Gaoyi, Yuanshi, and Zanhuang in Taihang; the vast area of Henan in Ji-Lu-Yu; Enxian, Daming, and Handan in Ji'nan; and Jianping and Nankou districts in Chahar Province. In order to overcome the disaster and ensure spring plowing production, each region has investigated the disaster situation in various places and formulated relief measures. The Taihang Administrative Office, based on the different conditions in the disaster areas, is exploring various avenues for production for the masses in the disaster areas, utilizing available production tools, and organizing and leading the masses in production. In repairing and blocking the Qin River embankment, the practice of work-for-grain compensation is implemented, organizing the masses in the disaster area to transport stone and straw materials in conjunction with the dike repair project. Since January, a total of over 135,000 jin of millet has been earned, solving the livelihood difficulties of most of the masses. The Da Fan Dike can be closed by the end of March, freeing up more than 300,000 mu of cultivated land, of which 200,000 mu can be planted this spring. The Taihang region is also combining support for the front, road construction, and trade company collection and transportation of military cloth with disaster relief. In supporting the front, disaster victims are organized to transport fuel from Jiaozuo to Huojia for the army besieging Xinxiang, earning 625,000 jin of millet in transportation fees from December last year to now. In the construction of railway bridges, the masses of Xiuwu County alone earned wages of over 200,000 jin of rice for transporting railway materials, and 11,600 jin of millet through work-for-grain compensation. In the above figures, the rice obtained by disaster victims accounts for four-fifths. The Taihang region is also combining the trade company's collection of military cloth and organizing women to spin and weave. In the use of relief grain, emphasis is placed on the families of revolutionary martyrs, military personnel, and workers, as well as the orphaned, widowed, elderly, and those without labor power. Recently, the Ji-Lu-Yu region has begun to focus on distributing production loans to disaster areas. The commissioner of the Seventh Special District personally went to Jining, Kunshan, and other counties to organize disaster victims in production; disaster victims are also engaged in various types of production, such as transportation, spinning and weaving, firing kilns, making agricultural tools, blankets, weaving mats, weaving baskets, fishing, grinding flour, and pressing oil. Farmers in disaster and non-disaster areas have fully demonstrated unity and friendship: Ding Guantun Village in Juye has settled more than 100 households of disaster victims from outside, lending them houses and furniture, and women have lent disaster victim women 40 flower carts. The masses of Ding Guantun automatically donated the small capital needed by disaster victims. In Enxian, Ji'nan, disaster areas are dredging the Shunshui Canal for drainage, and most of 18 villages have been drained. In addition, 1,000 head of draught animals have been transferred from non-disaster areas to disaster areas for spring plowing, which can cultivate more than 400 hectares of land in ten days, accounting for one-quarter of the land that should be cultivated. More than 2,900 jin of early-maturing crop seeds (seven-leaf sorghum) have been transported to disaster areas. Some young and middle-aged people go to other areas to chop grass, do odd jobs, or fish. Chahar Province has organized disaster victim committees to launch a "spoon of rice" and "handful of dates" campaign for the masses in disaster areas, which is controlled and adjusted by the sub-districts, and a large amount of tree leaves and dried vegetables are collected. All cadres in the sub-district are called upon to save 10 jin of millet each this year, advance it in advance, and widely organize the masses to carry out sideline production. Public-owned stores and promotion agencies are vigorously helping to solve difficulties such as raw materials and sales channels. Public-owned factories make shoes or contract other handicrafts, giving priority to disaster areas as much as possible. Each region calls on the masses in disaster areas to grow more melons, vegetables, and early-maturing crops to shorten the famine time.

　　[Our Newspaper's Report] The North China People's Government has recently issued instructions to all administrative offices and provincial governments, stipulating the figures for the distribution of relief grain. This relief grain is permitted to be used in areas suffering from regional natural disasters and relatively severe enemy disasters, and the amount is distributed according to the severity of the disaster and the size of the affected population. 3 million jin for the Ji-Lu-Yu region, 800,000 jin for the Ji-Zhong region, 1.6 million jin for Chahar, 600,000 jin for Ji'nan, 1.1 million jin for Taihang, 800,000 jin for Jin-Zhong, and 100,000 jin for Taiyue. This relief grain is controlled and distributed by the administrative offices and provincial governments to the special counties. Other small-scale relief needs, including supplementary grain for revolutionary martyrs, military personnel, and workers, grain for transporting the remains of martyrs and changing coffins, necessary relief after the return of displaced populations from large cities to their hometowns, relief after floods and epidemics, urban vagrant rehabilitation expenses, and supplementary grain for public welfare institutions with insufficient production, etc., are all paid from local grain, and the proportion of which in local grain is determined by the administrative offices and provincial governments. Among them, if the necessary relief grain after the return of displaced populations from large cities to their hometowns is excessively large and the local grain is insufficient to cover the expenses, it must be reported to the North China Government for approval. Public grain and local grain must not be used in the name of relief grain for any items other than the above-mentioned items. The transportation expenses of prisoners of war shall be paid by the army.
