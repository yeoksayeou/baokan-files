(Reported by this newspaper) Generals Xu Xiangqian (Commander and Political Commissar of the People's Liberation Army on the Taiyuan Front), Zhou Shidi (Deputy Commander), and Luo Ruiqing (Deputy Political Commissar) have issued a letter to the Chiang-Yan army officers and soldiers trapped in Taiyuan. The full text is as follows:

　　Chiang-Yan army officers and soldiers trapped in Taiyuan:

　　The People's Liberation Army will soon launch a general offensive on Taiyuan. Our army has repeatedly advised Yan Xishan and many of your senior officers, hoping that they would cease resistance and resolve the Taiyuan issue peacefully and rationally. However, war criminal Yan Xishan stubbornly refuses to accept our army's advice and dreams of using the lives of the people of Taiyuan and your lives to maintain his criminal rule. Even during the peripheral battles, Yan Xishan issued a reactionary "August 23rd Hand Order," forcing you to "coexist with the positions." Under the slogan of "whoever retreats will be shot on the spot," many officers and soldiers have been brutally slaughtered. Later, he organized the so-called "Combat City," forcing all citizens of Taiyuan to continue building fortifications for him and act as cannon fodder. Furthermore, he flew to Nanjing several times to request direct assistance from American imperialism, continuing to advocate war. In a word: he wants you to die for him in vain.

　　Since the Taiyuan campaign began, our army has repeatedly pointed out a way out for you. Many of you have already come over after accepting our army's advice. They have been liberated. Those who wished to return home have already returned; those who wished to work have already found work.

　　Chiang-Yan army officers and soldiers, our army has now deployed powerful troops, exceeding you many times in terms of both manpower and firepower. Please think carefully, can the isolated city of Taiyuan withstand the powerful People's Liberation Army's offensive? Cities like Beiping, Tianjin, Jinzhou, Shenyang, Changchun, and Jinan could not withstand it, so is Taiyuan stronger than these places? You must remember well, do not believe Yan Xishan's nonsense about "Combat City," "Iron City," "Steel City," etc. No matter how many pillboxes there are, steel and concrete pillboxes cannot withstand the powerful artillery fire and large amounts of yellow explosives of the People's Liberation Army. Let's put these aside for now, can you eat your fill, can you get oil and salt? Why have many of you become blind at night? Even if the People's Liberation Army does not attack you, as long as we completely cut off your food supply and surround you for a month or two, can you endure it?

　　Chiang-Yan army officers and soldiers, you should think carefully for yourselves. You have already fallen into such a desperate situation, what reason do you have to give your lives for Yan Xishan? What reason do you have to drag the people of Taiyuan down with you? What reason do you have to make your parents and wives cry and worry about you all day long?

　　Chiang-Yan army soldiers, you are all workers, farmers, students, or small businessmen who have been captured and forced to sell your lives. Most of your families have been liberated and have been allocated land and houses. You should demand that your officers surrender immediately. If they refuse to listen, you should take every opportunity to come over. You should secretly collude, kill the secret agents who are monitoring you, and kill the officers who are forcing you to fight. If you cannot escape, you must lay down your weapons automatically when our army attacks and never resist, or you will be throwing away your lives in vain.

　　Chiang-Yan army officers! You must not continue to be enemies of the people and continue to sell your lives for war criminals. You should demand that Yan Xishan and your superior officers surrender immediately. If they refuse to listen, you should lead your troops to surrender without hesitation. If you cannot, you must order your subordinates not to resist and lay down their weapons as soon as possible when our army attacks.

　　Chiang-Yan army officers and soldiers: Please remember these two most important sentences: if you attempt to resist stubbornly, you are seeking your own death; only surrendering or not resisting is the way to survive.

　　徐向前等将军
  　告困守太原敌官兵书
    【本报讯】太原前线人民解放军司令员兼政治委员徐向前将军、副司令员周士第将军、副政治委员罗瑞卿将军，顷发表告困守太原的蒋阎军官兵书，全文如下：
    困守太原的蒋阎军官兵们：
    人民解放军很快就要对太原举行总攻击了。本军曾三番五次劝告阎锡山和你们的许多高级军官，希望他们停止抵抗和平合理的解决太原问题。但战犯阎锡山却死不接受本军的忠告，并梦想以太原城人民和你们的生命来维持他们的罪恶统治。还在外围作战的时候，阎锡山就下过一个反动的“八月二十三日手令”，强迫你们“与阵地共存亡”。在“谁退却就当场打死谁”的口号下，许多官兵遭受了残酷的屠杀。以后又组织所谓“战斗城”，逼迫太原所有市民继续给他修工事，当炮灰。并且几次飞往南京请求美帝国主义的直接援助，继续鼓吹战争，总之一句话：就是要你们给他白白送死。
    自从太原作战以来，本军多次给你们指出一条应该走的活路，你们中的许多官兵因为接受了本军的劝告，已经跑过来了。他们得到了解放，愿回家的已经回家；愿工作的已经得到工作了。
    蒋阎军官兵们，本军现又调来了强大兵团，无论兵力火力，都超过你们多少倍。请你们仔细想想，太原这座孤城，能够抵挡得住强大的人民解放军的进攻么？北平、天津、锦州、沈阳、长春、济南等城都抵挡不住，太原难道比这些地方强些么？你们要好好记住，不要相信阎锡山什么“战斗城”、“铁城”、“钢城”等等的鬼话，什么林立碉也好，钢骨水泥碉也好都是经不起人民解放军强大炮火和大量黄色炸药的打击的。现就抛开这些不说吧，请问你们吃得饱饭、吃得上油盐么？请问你们中的许多人晚上何以都变成了瞎子？人民解放军就是不打你们，只要完全截断你们的粮食接济，再围上你们个把月，请问你们受得了受不了？
    蒋阎军官兵们，你们应该好好为自己打算一下，你们已经陷入这样的绝境，你们有什么理由要为阎锡山送掉性命？你们有什么理由把太原的老百姓一起拖下水？你们有什么理由使你们的父母妻子成天哭泣着为你们担心？
    蒋阎军士兵们，你们都是被抓来卖命的工人、农民、学生或小商人。你们的家，大部分都得到了解放，而且还分到了土地和房屋。你们应该要求你们的官长马上投降。如果他们不听，就应该利用一切机会跑过来。你们应该秘密串通，打死监视你们的特务，打死逼迫你们作战的军官，万一跑不过来，就要在本军攻击的时候，自动放下武器，千万不要抵抗，白白送了自己的生命。
    蒋阎军军官们！你们切不可再继续与人民为敌，再继续为战犯卖命，你们应该要求阎锡山和你们的上级长官，马上投降。如果他们不听就应该毫不犹豫地率领你们的部队投降过来。万一不能，就要在本军攻击的时候，命令你的部下，不要抵抗，趁早放下武器。
    蒋阎军官兵们：请你们记住这两句最要紧的话，如果你们企图顽抗，就是自寻死路；只有投降过来或不作抵抗才是生路。
