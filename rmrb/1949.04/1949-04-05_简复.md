　　Brief Replies

　　Comrade Hou Yue: Your letter reflecting the good production of the local government agencies has been received. We have forwarded your original letter to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce. According to the reply from the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, various production agencies are now being reorganized in accordance with the decision on production by government agencies. We hope that you can regularly send us letters reflecting various situations for the reference of the leading organs.

　　Mr. Sheng Wu: If you plan to practice medicine in Beiping, you can register at the Beiping Municipal People's Government Health Bureau. However, the specific registration procedures have not yet been announced, so you may have to wait for the time being. As for the procedures for joining the Traditional Chinese Medicine Association, you can join as long as you hold a license issued by the government after registration.

　　Mr. Zhang Jianwei: Please come to the Social Services Group of this newspaper for a discussion.

　　Mr. Wang Zhengcheng: There is a bank exchange office in Shanhaiguan, specializing in exchanging People's Bank Notes and Northeast Currency for passengers entering and leaving the customs. There is no limit to the amount of exchange.

　　Mr. Zhang Ao and Mr. Lin Lan: You are telecommunications technicians and can register at the Social Service Office at Damochang, Qianmenwai. They should be able to help you find a job.

　　Mr. Liu Mianchun: Please come to the Social Services Group of this newspaper for a discussion.

　　Mr. Jiang Zhenru: Since the house you want to live in has been taken over by the Military Control Commission, you can discuss the rent issue with the Military Control Commission.

　　Mr. Wang Qiuxin: If former Kuomintang soldiers are occupying your house, you can report it to your district government or work team for resolution.

　　Mr. Fusheng: Your suggestion has been forwarded to the editorial department of this newspaper for research.

　　Comrade Pan Haichao: The letter in which you advised your two nephews to join the People's Liberation Army has been received. However, since your nephews have no fixed address, and we do not know where they are now, there is no need to publish it in the newspaper. Your determination to serve the people to the end is admirable!
