　　The East China New Democratic Youth League Grows in Battle

　　During the People's Liberation War, East China was a key area for enemy offensives and repeated sweeps. In the past three years, large and small battles have been continuous. All the people of East China have mobilized to participate in the heroic and resolute struggle against the enemy. The East China New Democratic Youth League has grown up in this fighting environment.

　　After the Youth League was established at the end of 1946, it first demonstrated its vanguard and exemplary role in joining the army, participating in the war, and supporting the front lines. In rural areas, League members took the lead in joining the army, ensuring the continuous expansion of the main forces. League members further strengthened the combat effectiveness of the militia and persisted in fighting on the spot, keeping many marginal areas in the hands of the people. An outstanding example is Shi Zhenyu, a Youth League member from Binhai, Lunan. She persisted on both sides of the Shu River for eighteen months, fighting the enemy ninety-two times, killing and wounding them. The enemy offered a reward of two million to remove this "thorn in their side," and seized all her family's property, forcing her father and mother to persuade her to return home. However, Shi Zhenyu kept in mind the oath she took when she carried the golden hook gun: "Never surrender until death, persist in the struggle to the end!" She rejected threats and inducements, disregarded her own injury, and fulfilled her oath to the League, resolutely fighting to the end. This is just one prominent example. As for the work of supporting the front, the achievements of League members were even greater. When the enemy's offensive was at its most severe and millions of laborers surged to the front lines, League members stood at the front of this line. In Subei, Shuyang, three thousand League members were commended for their contributions in a grain transport movement, totaling 1,226 people, accounting for 40% of all League members. Another example is Cheng Yongguang, a model League member from Yidong County, Luzhongnan, in supporting the front. During the self-defense war, he supported the front seven times, providing stretchers for two years, receiving a first-class merit once and a third-class merit three times, rescuing twelve wounded soldiers on the front lines, delivering explosives, capturing three long and short guns, and arresting one secret agent. He participated in every famous battle in Shandong. His story represents the performance of many League members in East China, and the victory of the war is inseparable from their contributions.

　　Youth League members are also active in production and construction and disaster relief. For example, in the river management project in Boxing County, the weather was very cold, and no one was willing to go into the water. Three League members took the lead in jumping into the river, which influenced the masses and enabled the river management work to be completed smoothly. League members in Shiping Village, Ping Township, Junan County, planted vegetables to relieve famine, successively helping 116 households.

　　In addition, in the land reform, League members demonstrated a high degree of class consciousness and selflessness, winning the support of the masses, and also made great achievements in leading youth to study.

　　Since its establishment and development in the war and land reform since the end of July 1946, the East China Youth League now has approximately 79,000 members, distributed in Luzhongnan, Jiaodong, Bohai, Subei, and Anhui regions, with Luzhongnan having the most and Subei the second most. Originally, rural League members accounted for the vast majority, but since the great counter-offensive, Weifang, Jinan, Xuzhou, Bengbu and other places have been successively liberated, and many Youth League members have entered the cities with the army, beginning to develop League organizations in cities, factories, and schools. For example, when Jinan was liberated, more than 300 League members participated in the takeover work on the front lines. Then, under the leadership of the League, a series of propaganda and education activities were carried out, student unions were established, and cultural and recreational and learning activities were promoted, starting the construction of the League. In February, in the movement of Jinan students participating in the southward work, the New Youth League members played a good leading role. Currently, Weifang and Jinan have established preparatory committees. The Jinan Youth League's publication, "Youth Culture," has been published for ten issues, with 4,500 copies per issue, which is very popular among the masses.

　　在战斗中成长的
  　华东新民主主义青年团
    华东在人民解放战争中，曾是敌人重点进攻和反复扫荡的地区，近三年来，大小战役连续不断，华东全体人民都动员起来参加了对敌人英勇坚决的斗争，华东新民主主义青年团就是在这种斗争环境中成长起来的。
    一九四六年末，青年团建立起来以后首先在参军参战支援前线中表现出它的先锋作用和模范作用。在农村中，团员带头参军，保证了主力部队的不断扩大。团员更加强了民兵的战斗力，坚持原地斗争，使许多边缘地区掌握在人民手中。杰出的例子是鲁南滨海的青年团员侍振玉，她在沭河两岸，曾坚持十八个月，和敌人作战九十二次，毙伤敌人，敌人为拔掉这颗“眼中钉”，曾悬赏二百万，并且抢光了她家庭的财产，逼她父亲母亲来劝诱她回家，但是侍振玉牢记着她背上金钩枪时的誓言：“至死不投降，坚持斗争到底！”她拒绝了威胁和利诱，不顾自己一度负伤，实现了自己对团的誓言，坚决斗争到底。这不过是一个显著的例子。至于在支前工作当中，团员所表现的成绩更大。当敌人进攻最严重，千万民工涌上前线的时候，团员是站在这行列的前头，苏北、沭阳有三千名团员，在一次支前运粮运动中被评有功并受表扬者合计一二二六人，占全体团员百分之四十，又如鲁中南沂东县支前模范团员程永光，他在自卫战争中间，支前七次，共出了二年的常备担架、立一等功一次、三等功三次，火线抢救伤员十二人，送过炸药，缴获过长短枪三支，捉住特务一人，山东每一个著名的战役他都参加了。他的故事代表着华东许多团员的表现，战争胜利和他们的贡献是分不开的。
    青年团员在生产建设救灾中也是积极的，如在博兴县的治河工程中，天气十分冷，没人肯下水，团员三人首先跳入河中，影响了群众，使治河工作得以顺利完成；莒南坪上石场村团员种菜救荒，先后救济了一一六户。
    此外，在土地改革中，团员表现了高度的阶级觉悟和大公无私的精神，获得群众的拥护，在领导青年学习中也取得了很大的成绩。
    华东青年团自一九四六年七末四年初在战争和土改中建立发展以来，现团员人数已达约七万九千，分布在鲁中南、胶东、渤海、苏北、安徽各地区，其中以鲁中南最多，苏北次之，原以农村团员占绝大多数，但自大反攻后，潍坊、济南、徐州、蚌埠等地相继解放，很多青年团员随军入城，开始在城市、工厂、学校发展团的组织。如济南解放时三百多团员在火线上参加接收工作，接着在团的领导下，开展了一连串的宣传教育活动，建立学生会，推动文娱与学习活动，开始建团，二月间，济南学生参加南下工作运动中，新青团员起了很好的带头作用，目前潍、济均已成立筹委会，济南青年团的刊物青年文化已出刊十期，每期四千五百份，深受群众欢迎。
