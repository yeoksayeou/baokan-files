　　Jidong Summarizes Month and a Half of Cadre Study
  　Decides to Diligently Study the History of Social Development
    [Jidong Telegram] The Jidong District General Study Committee reviewed and summarized the on-the-job cadre study for the month and a half since March, believing that the on-the-job cadres of various military district organs generally have high enthusiasm for learning and have also adhered to the learning system. The cultural learning of various organs is gradually becoming standardized. However, some problems and shortcomings were also discovered. Generally, the leadership did not grasp the situation tightly enough or deeply enough, and did not provide enough help to Group B lectures. Group A studied independently, and problems were not expanded. The grouping standards of some units were also inconsistent. During the study, it was also found that some comrades had the phenomenon of "splitting hairs." For example, arguing about "which came first, the chicken or the egg" and "where did the ape-men come from," failing to grasp the center of the problem, hindering the deepening of learning. In addition, after starting theoretical study, the study of current affairs and policies was generally neglected. The General Study Committee studied the above situation and made the following resolutions to improve future learning: (1) Extend the study plan and stipulate that the "Concise History of Social Development" should be completed by the end of May; (2) Emphasize to cadres at all levels that the attitude of learning should be careful and diligent, and the attitude of "reading a lot without seeking thorough understanding" is undesirable; (3) Clearly stipulate the grouping standards; (4) Implement the meeting report and inspection system.

　　冀东总结月半干部学习
  　决精读社会发展史
    【冀东电】冀东区总学委会检讨总结自三月份开始以来一个半月间的在职干部学习，认为军区各机关在职干部一般的学习情绪高，也坚持了学习制度，各机关的文化学习，逐步走向正规。但也发现一些问题和缺点。一般是领导上抓得不紧不够深入，对乙组讲课帮助不够，甲组孤立自学，问题展不开，有些单位编组标准也不一致。在学习中，也发现个别同志有钻牛角的现象。如争论“先有鸡，先有蛋”“类人猿是从哪里来的”等，抓不住问题的中心，妨碍了学习的深入。另外，开始理论学习后，一般的忽视了对时事政策的学习。总学委会研究了上述情况，为改进今后学习，作出以下几点决议：（一）延长学习计划，规定到五月底学完社会发展简史；（二）向各级干部着重指出，学习态度应当是精心钻研，“好读书不求甚解”的态度是要不得的；（三）明确规定编组标准；（四）执行会议汇报及巡视检查制度。
