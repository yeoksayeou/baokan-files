　　Jinnan Banks of the Fen River Build Sluice Gates for Irrigation
　　[Reported by this newspaper] The first phase, second stage of the Shijin Canal Irrigation Project commenced on March 15th. The 300-meter-long temporary dam at the Huangbizhuang water intake in Huolu began pile driving as early as March 5th, and 270 piles have now been completed, accounting for 77 percent of the total number of piles. In addition to the temporary dam, the entire project includes a total of 107 large and small projects such as inlet gates, bridges, weirs, aqueducts, railways, culverts, and sluice gates for the four branch canals. The larger projects are all constructed with reinforced concrete or cement mortar masonry. It is expected that all projects will be completed by the end of April. According to the survey of small canal lines by personnel from the Shijin Canal Irrigation Project Office in conjunction with local district, village cadres, and the masses, the second, third, fourth, and fifth branch canals of the irrigation project can currently irrigate more than 132,000 mu of land. In the future, if farmland is leveled and the branch canal lines are extended, the irrigated area can be increased to 200,000 mu.

　　[Jinnan Dispatch] The Fourth Special District is digging canals along the riverbanks for irrigation to ensure spring planting and to save more than 20,000 mu of wheat seedlings. Due to the lack of snow last winter and the black, sticky soil, the spring land in Beiyu and other villages in Ningnan County could not be planted, and the wheat seedlings were weak and yellow. At the end of February, the district party and government leading organs convened a meeting of relevant village cadres and decided to build sluice gates on the North Fen River for irrigation, which has now been successfully completed. Currently, 6,450 mu of autumn land and 23,050 mu of wheat land have been irrigated. In Zhao Village, Ren County, 32 people were organized to dig a three-li long and three-foot wide irrigation ditch in two days, turning 100 mu of dry land into paddy fields.

　　冀中修整石津运河
  　冀南北沣河沿岸修闸浇地
    【本报讯】石津运河灌溉工程第一期第二阶段工程已于三月十五日兴工。位于获鹿黄壁庄取水口处长达三百公尺的临时拦河坝，早在三月五日即开始打桩，现已完成二百七十根，占打桩总数百分之七十七。全部工程除临时拦河坝外，尚有四条支渠的进水闸、桥梁、跌水、渡槽、铁路、涵洞、斗门等大小工程共计一百零七件，其中较大工程均系用钢筋混凝土或洋灰胶砂砌料石筑成，预计在四月底全部完工。据石津运河灌溉工程处派员结合当地区、村干部和群众勘查小渠线结果，该灌溉工程第二、三、四、五四个支渠目前可有十三万二千余亩地能够上水，将来如经过整平农田延长支渠线，上水地亩可增到二十万亩。

    【冀南电】四专区沿河地带开渠浇地，保证春地下种，使二万余亩麦苗得收。宁南县北鱼等村因去冬无雪，又加土质黑黏，使春地不能下种，麦苗黄弱，该区党政领导机关，二月底即召集有关村庄干部会议，决定在北沣河修闸浇地，现已顺利完成。目前已浇秋地六千四百五十亩，麦地二万三千零五十亩。任县赵庄组织了三十二人，两天挖成一条三里长三尺宽的浇地沟，该村百亩旱地变成了水田。
