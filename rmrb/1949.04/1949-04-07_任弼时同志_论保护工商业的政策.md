Editor's Note: After the successive liberation of cities like Beiping, Tianjin, Tangshan, and Zhangjiakou, the central task of the Party in these cities is to rapidly restore and develop production, transforming consumer cities into productive cities. However, to achieve this goal, it is first necessary to correctly implement the policy on the workers' movement and the policy of protecting industry and commerce, and to resolutely combat "leftist" and rightist tendencies in the implementation of these policies. To this end, we are re-publishing the Xinhua News Agency's "February 7th" commemorative editorial from 1948, "Adhere to the Correct Line in the Workers' Movement, Oppose 'Leftist' Adventurism," the part of Comrade Ren Bishi's report from January of the same year concerning the policy of protecting industry and commerce, and the Xinhua News Agency's short commentary from September of the same year, "Correctly Implement the Policy of Labor-Capital Benefit," etc. In these documents, on the one hand, the harm of "leftist" errors in the workers' movement is pointed out, stating that it "damages or reduces production, harms the liberated areas, harms the victory of the war, and harms the construction of a new democratic society; its terrible extent is the same as the 'Three Alls Policy' of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang." On the other hand, rightist errors that may occur in urban work are also pointed out: "Protecting the legitimate and proper interests of industrialists and businessmen does not mean that we should unconditionally help them in their operations that are detrimental to the national economy, nor can we fail to pay attention to ensuring the various rights that workers should enjoy." Therefore, it is emphasized that all relevant leading organs should prevent the occurrence of either of the above deviations at any time and any place, and ensure the correct implementation of the policy of "developing production, prospering the economy, taking into consideration both public and private interests, and benefiting both labor and capital." These instructions are very beneficial for helping comrades in urban work to better grasp policies and for helping people of all strata to further understand our Party's policies. It is hoped that all localities will conduct in-depth study in conjunction with the inspection of urban policies.

    Don't adopt adventurous policies towards industry and commerce. Phenomena of damaging industry and commerce have already occurred in various places. For example, in Gaojiabao in Shenmu County, northern Shaanxi, even small vendors were confiscated when it was recovered by our army. This is a suicidal policy. The Outline Land Law of China stipulates "protecting the property and legitimate business of industrialists and businessmen from infringement." General industry and commerce should be protected. Even industry and commerce run by landlords and rich peasants should not be confiscated, but should also be protected by the democratic government. Don't discriminate against these industries and businesses just because they are invested in by landlords and rich peasants. This is not right. Instead, we should see that the existence of these industries and businesses is beneficial to today's social economy. The Party's policy is to only confiscate the industry and commerce of bureaucratic capital and truly big despots and counter-revolutionaries, turning it over to the state or the people. And it is determined that those industries and businesses that should be confiscated, and that are needed by the national economy, must be able to continue operating, must not be shut down, and even more must not be destroyed or arbitrarily dispersed. These policies not only apply to the original liberated areas, but also apply to newly liberated areas in the future. You will be going out to fight soon, and you must strictly abide by this policy and absolutely not repeat errors like the one in Gaojiabao. So, can the industry and commerce invested in by landlords who sold their land during the past rent and interest reduction period now be confiscated? No, they cannot. We have protected and encouraged these industries and businesses in the past and now, because this is beneficial and needed for the prosperity of China's economy. When struggling against landlords and their wealth, it must be stipulated that landlords are not allowed to destroy existing industries and businesses, otherwise they will be punished.

    Chairman Mao said: "Due to the backwardness of the Chinese economy, the capitalist economy represented by the vast petty bourgeoisie and middle bourgeoisie must be allowed to exist for a long period of time even after the revolution has triumphed throughout the country; and according to the division of labor in the national economy, all parts of them that are beneficial to the national economy need to be developed; they are still an indispensable part of the entire national economy." We must explain this reasoning of Chairman Mao clearly to the workers, peasants, and soldiers, so that they understand why there must be industry and commerce, and educate all working people to understand that local and temporary interests must be subordinate to the overall and long-term interests. For example, if a landlord opens a coal mine, the peasants, from the perspective of their current local interests, can raise their hands to support confiscation and distribution, because temporarily solving their own problems is possible by sharing a portion of the coal mine's tools and materials. If we approve doing this, it seems formally to be following the mass line, but in essence, it is committing the error of tailism. In this situation, we must persuade the peasants to understand the benefits of the coal mine existing intact; dispersing it will destroy the coal mine, and as a result, they themselves will have no coal to burn, which will hinder the economic development of the liberated area.

    We say that the economy of the liberated areas must be independent and self-reliant; we cannot be a colony of a colony. Only when we do not rely on others economically will we have strength militarily and politically. If we want to be economically independent and self-reliant, we must ensure that state-owned, private, and people's cooperative-operated handicrafts and industries, as well as rural agriculture, all develop; producing large quantities of necessities and food for the people and the army; and enabling our foreign trade to maintain a balance, and even a surplus, without buying goods from the Chiang area and American goods.

    With industrial and agricultural products, there is a need for commerce, such as public and private shops, consumer cooperatives, etc., as bridges, so that producers can sell the goods they produce and consumers can obtain these goods. Only through such circulation can industry and agriculture engage in reproduction and expanded reproduction. Currently, the government's trading companies in the liberated areas do not yet have the strength to widely establish shops (the state-owned shops established by many organs and troops often do not fulfill their due tasks in order to solve the difficulties of their own units, and even violate policies). Cooperatives are also not widely developed and are often poorly managed. Therefore, the existence of private merchants is needed. Merchants certainly exploit; merchants' commercial activities themselves do not produce any value. They either share a portion of the capitalists' profits or directly exploit producers and consumers. Sometimes hoarding and speculating is even more harmful. But the issue is not to destroy commerce, but to lead commerce. To be able to grasp the entire development of commerce, to make merchants serve us, and not to be served by merchants. This policy is of course beneficial to the people, and it is also beneficial to legitimate merchants. As for small merchants and peddlers, most of them are poor; their lives are only equivalent to those of poor peasants, middle peasants, or well-to-do middle peasants. They should not be attacked even more. The destruction of commerce that occurred in Gaojiabao in northern Shaanxi is absolutely wrong. If commerce there is ruined, the common people will have to go to Yulin, Shenmu, or Zhenchuanbao to buy and sell things, which will be very inconvenient. Therefore, we should adopt a policy of protection and leadership towards industry and commerce; we must never destroy them. Destruction is a suicidal policy. Taxes must be collected from industry and commerce, but appropriate tax rates must be set. These tax rates should be based on the principle of not affecting their operation and development; otherwise, mistakes will be made.

### 任弼时同志　论保护工商业的政策

　　任弼时同志
  　论保护工商业的政策
    编者按：北平、天津、唐山、张垣等城市相继解放后，在这些城市中党的中心任务，是迅速恢复与发展生产，把消费的城市变为生产的城市。但要达到这个目的首先必须正确执行职工运动的方针与保护工商业的政策，与执行这些政策中“左”的和右的倾向作坚决的斗争。为此，我们特将新华社一九四八年“二七”纪念社论“坚持职工运动中的正确路线反对‘左’倾冒险主义”，同年一月任弼时同志报告中关于保护工商业的政策部分，及同年九月新华社短评“正确执行劳资两利方针”等文件，重新陆续发表。在这些文件中，一方面指出职工运动中“左”倾错误危害，它“破坏或降低生产，是危害解放区的，危害战争胜利的，危害新民主主义社会建设的，其可怕的程度是与蒋介石匪帮的‘三光政策’是一样的。”另一方面，又指出了城市工作中可能发生的右倾错误：“保护工商业主合法的正当的利益，并不是说因此就无原则地帮助其不利于国民经济的经营，就可以不注意保障工人应享有的各种权利。”因而着重指出：一切有关的领导机关，应该随时随地防止上述任何一种偏向的发生，保证“发展生产，繁荣经济，公私兼顾，劳资两利”政策的正确执行。这些指示，对于帮助城市工作同志更好掌握政策和帮助各阶层人民进一步了解我党政策，是非常有益的，希望各地结合城市政策的检查进行深入的学习。
    　　　　　
    对工商业不要采取冒险政策。各地已发生有破坏工商业的现象，例如陕北神木地区的高家堡，当被我军收复时，连小商贩也没收了。这是一种自杀政策。中国土地法大纲上规定“保护工商业者的财产及其合法的营业，不受侵犯”，一般工商业是应当受到保护的，就是地主富农所经营的工商业，也不应当没收，同样是应当受到民主政府的保护。不要以为这些工商业是地主富农所投资而加以歧视，这是不对的，而应当看到这些工商业的存在，有益于今天的社会经济。党的政策是仅仅没收官僚资本与真正大恶霸反革命分子的工商业归国家或人民所有，并且确定这些应当没收的工商业，凡是为国民经济所需要者，必须使之能够继续营业，不得停闭，更不得破坏和任意分散。这些政策不仅适用于原有解放区，也适用于将来解放的新区域。你们不久就要打出去，必须严格遵守这种政策，绝对不能重复如象高家堡一类的错误。那么地主在过去减租减息时期将土地变卖而投资工商业者，现在是否可以没收呢？不可以的。我们过去和现在都是保护和鼓励这些工商业，因为这样对于繁荣中国的经济是有利的，是需要的。在斗地主地财时，必须规定不许地主破坏已有的工商业，否则要受处罚。
    毛主席说：“由于中国经济的落后性，广大的小资产阶级与中等资产阶级所代表的资本主义经济，即使革命在全国胜利之后，在一个长时期内，还是必须允许他们存在；并且按照国民经济的分工，还需要他们中一切有益于国民经济的部分有一个发展；他们在整个国民经济中，还是不可缺少的一部分”。我们要把毛主席这篇道理，向工人农民和士兵群众解释清楚，使他们懂得为何要有工商业，教育一切劳动人民懂得，局部的暂时的利益，要服从整个的长远的利益。譬如地主开座煤窑，农民从目前局部利益出发，是可以举手拥护没收分配的，因为将煤窑的工具和物资大家分到一份，可以暂时解决自己的问题。如果我们批准这样做，形式上看来是走群众路线，实质上是犯了尾巴主义的错误。在这种情形下，我们要说服农民懂得煤窑完整存在的利益，分散了就会把煤窑弄垮，结果自己也会无煤烧，这就妨碍了解放区的经济发展。
    我们说解放区经济要独立自主，我们不能作殖民地的殖民地。只有经济上不依靠别人，军事上政治上才会有力量。我们要经济上能独立自主，就要使公营的、私营的、人民合作社经营的手工业、工业，以及农村的农业都有一个发展；生产人民与军队大量的必需品和粮食；使我们对外贸易能保持平衡，以至出超，不去买蒋区的货物和美国货。
    有了工业农业生产品，就需要有商业，例如公私商店，消费合作社等作为桥梁，使生产者能卖出他们所生产的商品，使消费者能够得到这些商品，经过这样的流转，才能使工农业进行再生产与扩大的再生产。现在解放区内政府的贸易公司还没有力量普设商店，（现在许多机关部队所设的公营商店，往往为着解决本单位困难，没有负起应有的任务，甚至有违反政策的现象发生。）合作社也发展得不普遍而且往往办得不好。因此，私商的存在是需要的。商人当然有剥削；商人的商业行为本身不生产任何价值，他们或者是分享资本家一部分利润，或者是直接对生产者消费着实行剥削。有时囤积居奇，作投机事业，为害更大。但问题不是要去破坏商业，而是要去领导商业。要能掌握整个商业的发展，要商人为我们所用，而不要我们为商人所用。这种政策对于人民固然是有利的，对于正当商人也是有利的。至于小商小贩，大部分是贫苦的，他们的生活只相当于贫农中农或富裕中农，更不应该去打击他们，如在陕北高家堡所发生的破坏商业的情形，是绝对错误的。那里的商业搞垮了，老百姓买卖东西就要到榆林、神木或镇川堡，那就很不方便。因此，我们对工商业，应采取保护和领导的政策，绝对不能破坏，破坏是一种自杀政策。对工商业必须收税，但必须订出恰当的税率，不要收得太重。这种税率，以不致影响他们的经营与发展为原则：否则，就会犯错误。
