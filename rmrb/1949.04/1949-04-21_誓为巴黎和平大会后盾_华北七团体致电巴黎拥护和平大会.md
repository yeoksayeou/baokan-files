Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, April 20th: The Preparatory Committee of the North China Federation of Trade Unions, the North China Farmers' Association, the North China Committee of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, the North China Youth Federation, the North China Women's Federation, the North China Student Federation, and the North China Literary and Art Workers Association jointly telegraphed the World Peace Congress in Paris on the 20th, expressing the willingness of the people of the North China Liberated Area to firmly support their struggle and vow to be their backing. The original telegram is as follows:

Xinhua News Agency to the World Peace Congress in Paris:

The people of the North China Liberated Area extend their highest respect to the representatives of the 600 million people of the world who oppose war and support peace, and express their willingness to firmly support your struggle and vow to be your backing. The people of North China express their serious protest against the French government's restrictions on the number of representatives from various countries allowed to enter the country, and demand the immediate cancellation of this unreasonable decision. The French government, following the lead of American imperialism, attempts to undermine the World Peace Congress. This action will not in the slightest shake the fighting will of the people of the world against war instigators.

For more than ten years, our North China has suffered extreme devastation under the invasion of Japanese fascists and the attack of the Kuomintang reactionaries, who were directly armed by American imperialists. Many people have been slaughtered, houses burned down, and fields left barren. However, the people of North China, together with the people of all of China, have always united and fought tenaciously, finally driving away the Japanese invaders, eliminating the Kuomintang reactionaries, and liberating all of North China. Now, national victory is about to arrive. We are beginning the work of new democratic production and construction.

Based on our own personal experience, we firmly believe that the aggressive bloc headed by American imperialism can certainly be defeated. We were blockaded by the enemy in a long and brutal struggle, with no foreign aid, relying entirely on seizing the enemy's weapons to arm ourselves. But we still built a huge army with modern equipment and achieved today's great and historically significant victory.

Now, the strength of the world peace camp headed by the Soviet Union far exceeds the strength of a handful of warmongers. As long as we unite, the danger of war can certainly be overcome. If the imperialist aggressive bloc dares to launch new war adventures regardless of everything, the 50 million people of North China, who already have their own organized workers, peasants, youth, women, and other people's masses with unprecedentedly improved awareness, will join the people of the world in sending the war instigators, together with the war, into the grave.

　　誓为巴黎和平大会后盾
  　华北七团体致电巴黎拥护和平大会
    【新华社北平二十日电】华北总工会筹委会、华北农民联合会、中国新民主主义青年团华北委员会、华北青年联合会、华北妇女联合会、华北学生联合会、华北文学艺术工作者协会，二十日联合致电巴黎世界拥护和平大会，表示华北解放区人民愿意坚决支持他们的斗争，誓为他们的后盾。原电如下：
    新华社转巴黎世界拥护和平大会：
    华北解放区人民向全世界六万万人民反对战争、拥护和平的代表们，致崇高的敬意，并表示愿意坚决支持你们的斗争，誓为你们的后盾。华北人民对法国政府限制各国代表入境人数，表示严重抗议，要求立即取消这个无理的决定。法国政府追随美国帝国主义之后，企图破坏世界拥护和平大会，这种举动决不能丝毫动摇全世界人民反对战争挑拨者的战斗意志。
    我华北十余年来在日本法西斯侵略者及美帝国主义者直接武装的国民党反动派进攻之下，遭受了极大的破坏，许多人民被屠杀了，房屋被焚毁了，田园荒芜了。但是华北人民和全中国人民一起，始终团结一致，顽强地斗争着，终于赶走了日本侵略者，消灭了国民党反动派，解放了全华北。现在，全国胜利不久就要到来了。我们正开始新民主主义的生产建设工作。
    我们根据自己亲身的经验，坚决相信美帝国主义为首的侵略集团，是一定能够被打败的。我们曾经在长期残酷的斗争中，被敌人封锁着，毫无外援，全凭夺取敌人的武器武装自己。但我们还是建立了庞大的具有现代化装备的军队，取得了今天伟大的有历史意义的胜利。
    现在，以苏联为首的世界和平阵营的力量，大大超过以一小撮战争贩子为首的力量。只要我们团结一致，战争危险就一定能被克服。如果帝国主义侵略集团敢于不顾一切，发动新的战争冒险，我华北五千万人民，已经有了自己组织的、觉悟程度空前提高的工人、农民、青年、妇女及其他人民群众，将同全世界人民在一起，把战争挑拨者连同战争，一起送入坟墓中去。
