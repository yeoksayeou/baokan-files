　　Shijiazhuang Guard Company Repairs Housing Themselves
  　Saving 370,000 Yuan
    [Shijiazhuang News] The guard company of the Shijiazhuang Garrison Command repaired their own living quarters. The houses they lived in were extensively damaged by the Kuomintang bandit troops when our army liberated Shijiazhuang the year before last. After liberation, twelve rooms were destroyed by Chiang Kai-shek's bandit planes. Moreover, last summer's continuous rain caused most of the walls to collapse. On the first of last month, the company held a cadre meeting and decided to rebuild. They started work on the second. Because there were very few shovels, hoes, and tools for building walls, they used their hands and feet to mix mud, and the bricks were mostly picked-up bricks, saving 300,000 yuan in new currency. Building the walls saved more than 13,000 yuan based on labor costs, and other savings such as transportation amounted to more than 58,000 yuan. The total savings amounted to more than 372,000 yuan. Many model deeds emerged during the work. For example, the new recruit Ren Baofu took off his shoes and socks to mix mud in the cold morning. Cook Zhang Gongyou and others actively participated in addition to cooking. Now they have completely repaired the twelve rooms and built a 36-zhang long wall. People passing by said: This is truly our people's army. If it were the Kuomintang, humph! I don't know how many laborers would be conscripted and how many people would be beaten! (Liu Pingze)

　　石市警卫连自己修房舍
  　节省三十七万元
    【石家庄讯】石市警备司令部警卫连，自己动手修整住所。他们住的房子在前年我军解放石市时，国民党匪军大肆破坏。解放后又被蒋匪飞机炸毁房十二间。且去夏连雨，围墙大部淋坍。上月一日该连召开干部会议，决定重修，二日即动工。因锹、铣及打围墙工具很少，他们便用手用脚和泥，用砖多是拣的砖头，节约了新币三十万元，打围墙如按工折算节约一万三千余元，其他如运输等共节约五万八千余元。总共节约三十七万二千余元。在工作中出现了很多模范事迹。如新战士任保福，早晨很冷，脱光脚和泥。炊事员张工友等除做饭外，也积极参加。现在他们已把十二间房完全修好，打起了三十六丈长的围墙。过路的人见了都说：真是咱们人民的军队，要是国民党，哼！不知要多少夫，打多少人哩！　　　　 　 （刘平泽）
