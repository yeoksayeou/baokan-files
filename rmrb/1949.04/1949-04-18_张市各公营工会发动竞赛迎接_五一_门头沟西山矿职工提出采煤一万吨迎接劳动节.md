Thirty-three trade union committee members from fourteen public factories in Zhangjiakou City attended.

Launch a mass campaign to evaluate merit, and after the evaluation, the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions and the factory will give commendations and rewards based on performance. 2. Launch a production competition to welcome "May Day". Each factory should make a production plan, and factories and workers should challenge each other. 3. Consolidate the existing trade union organization, and continue to develop membership, expand the organization, and establish various systems to truly turn the trade union and the factory into the home of the workers. 4. Carry out publicity and education work among workers, cooperate with the merit evaluation production competition by putting up wall posters, developing correspondents, staging plays, singing songs to enliven the club, and preparing to celebrate "May Day". 5. Do a good job in worker welfare, and organize family members of workers to produce. Finally, Sun Ming, director of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, pointed out: It is necessary to demonstrate the great strength of the working class in welcoming the "May Day" festival, rapidly restore and develop production, and support the Liberation War.
