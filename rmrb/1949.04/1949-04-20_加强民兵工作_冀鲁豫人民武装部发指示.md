(Hebei-Shandong-Henan Telegram) The People's Armed Forces Department of Hebei-Shandong-Henan Region has recently issued instructions for spring work. 1. Adjust and allocate cadres, and improve leadership organizations. 2. Rectify militia organizations and strengthen militia education. Villages with few militiamen should be developed to maintain a sound organization, especially in areas south of the Yellow River, where efforts must be made to develop the militia to account for 5% of the village population after the completion of land reform and party rectification. Border areas should not only strengthen political education but also pay attention to improving military skills. 3. Organize patrols to stabilize social order, and work with public security departments to investigate and prevent theft and robbery. 4. Strictly clean up and register weapons. The use of firearms must be fixed. This can be discussed and allocated by the branch, and must be kept in the hands of reliable elements to prevent bad elements from infiltrating and stealing the people's armed forces. 5. Educate militiamen to connect with the masses around production and land reform work. In actively participating in production and land reform work, the entire militia organization should be improved. In addition, in order to unify the organization and facilitate work, organizations such as the Self-Defense Forces will be uniformly renamed Village People's Armed Forces Departments, directly under the leadership of the village branch. They will be organized by the minister, militia squad leaders, and self-defense隊 captains (three to five people). The minister will be concurrently the armed forces committee member of the branch, leading the entire village militia and self-defense隊.

　　加强民兵工作
  　冀鲁豫人民武装部发指示
    【冀鲁豫电】冀鲁豫人民武装部，顷发出春季工作指示。一、调整配备干部，健全领导机构。二、整顿民兵组织，加强民兵教育。民兵少的村庄要进行发展，保持健全，特别是黄河以南地区，在结束土改与整党中，必须争取发展到占全村人口的百分之五。边沿区除加强政治教育外，并注意军事技术的提高。三、组织巡逻，安定社会秩序，并结合公安部门，清查与防止盗劫事件。四、严格清理登记武器，枪支的使用要固定起来。此可由支部讨论分配，一定掌握在可靠分子手里，严防坏分子混入窃夺人民武装。五、围绕生产及土地改革等工作，教育民兵联系群众。在积极参加生产及土改工作中，使整个民兵组织健全起来。此外为使组织划一，便于工作，将自卫队部等组织，一律改称村人民武装部，归村支部直接领导，由部长、民兵队班长、自卫队队长三至五人组织，部长由支部武装部委员兼任，领导全村民兵、自卫队。
