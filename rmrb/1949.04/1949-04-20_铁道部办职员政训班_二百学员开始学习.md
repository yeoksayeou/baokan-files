　　Ministry of Railways Runs Cadre Political Training Class
　　Two Hundred Students Begin Studying
　　[Our Newspaper] The Ministry of Railways' political training class for railway employees opened on the 19th, with over two hundred and ten students. All the students were in extremely high spirits and very active. The students are mostly former employees from various departments of the railway bureau, the majority being middle and lower-level staff. Before the school officially opened, nearly ten days of study had already taken place, and it was discovered that some students were worried about being dismissed in the future. The leadership, based on this thinking, conducted education, explaining the purpose of running the training class was to reform and educate everyone, thus dispelling some of their ideological concerns. The class's study plan is divided into three stages: The first stage involves studying current affairs, such as studying Chairman Mao's "Current Situation and Our Tasks" and other documents, using a combination of reports, self-study, and group discussions. The second stage is to study various policies, such as urban policies and industrial and commercial policies, establishing new thinking and new viewpoints through policy learning. The third stage is to connect with oneself to examine one's thoughts, conduct criticism and self-criticism, and truly transform everyone ideologically, to achieve the goal of serving the people. The class plans to gradually expand to four hundred people.

　　铁道部办职员政训班
  　二百学员开始学习
    【本报讯】铁道部铁路职员政治训练班于十九日开学，学员二百一十多人。全体学员情绪极为高涨活跃。该校学员多为铁路局各部旧职员，大部份为中下级职员。在该校未正式举行开学以前，已经进行了将近十天的学习，发现有一部份学员耽心着将来不要他。领导上根据这种思想进行教育，说明办训练班的目的，是为了改造教育大家，这样才解除了他们一部份思想顾虑。该班学习计划分为三个阶段：第一个阶段，进行关于时事的学习，如学习毛主席目前形势和我们的任务等文件，采用报告、自学、小组讨论等三种方式结合进行。第二阶段是学习各种政策，如城市政策、工商业政策等，通过学习政策建立新的思想和新的观点。第三个阶段则为联系自己检查思想，进行批评与自我批评，真正使每一个人都从思想上得到改造，达到为人民服务的目的。该班并准备逐渐扩充到四百人。
