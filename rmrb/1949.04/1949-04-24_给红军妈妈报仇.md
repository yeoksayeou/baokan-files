Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains Front, 23rd:

　　The advance guard arrived at Lijiahe in Macheng County and reported astonishing news to the villagers: Li Chengfang, who joined the Red Army twenty years ago, was returning today.

　　Early in the morning, the village entrance was crowded with people. They waited, gazing at the endless stream of troops in the distance. They walked up to the marching soldiers, identifying each sunburned face in the ranks. The "old revolutionaries" with long beards had tears in their joyful eyes.

　　Li Chengfang was only sixteen years old when he joined the Red Army. He was just a skinny little kid, but he couldn't bear the Kuomintang's crimes, so he became a Red Army soldier and made revolution until now. As he saw the trees and rooftops of his hometown from afar, he couldn't help but get excited. What would it be like to see his family? What would he say to acquaintances? He had never been so nervous in the face of any powerful enemy. When he saw the village entrance full of people, his eyes welled up. He walked into the crowd, greeting people happily, carefully looking at each face, but his heart slowly contracted. He didn't recognize anyone. After a long time, he saw an old man come forward and say in a trembling voice, "Are you Chengfang?" This was his uncle, Li Qingyi.

　　Commander Li was surrounded by a large crowd and led into the house. Children surrounded him, laughing, running, and playing behind this unfamiliar Red Army uncle. The elderly were filled with emotion. The child had grown up, returned with troops, and the final victory was about to come. But…

　　Li Qingyi leaned close to the commander and said with grief and indignation, "After you left, the White Party (referring to the Kuomintang) crushed the Dabie Mountains. In March of the 21st year of the Republic (1932), your father was starved to death, and in July, your mother was starved to death; fifty-four people from sixteen families in the whole village were starved to death! The following year, your sister also disappeared, everyone was too hungry to care for each other. Your house was also torn down by the White Army..."

　　The old men led him to a pile of rubble, pointing and saying, "Remember? This used to be your family's hall, this was the kitchen where you ate." As he pointed to a corner overgrown with weeds, his fingers couldn't help but tremble: "You used to sleep there when you were a kid!"

　　Commander Li hurried to see the mother of a comrade. His son had joined the revolution with Commander Li, but had already sacrificed his life. The room was terribly deserted, and everything had been trampled on by the Kuomintang bandits. The dilapidated walls were blackened by smoke, with streaks of rainwater running down them. The stove looked like it hadn't been lit for years, and the floor was covered in dust and cobwebs.

　　Suddenly, a blind, white-haired old woman, as ragged as a beggar, stood up from the haystack. She called out his childhood name with all her might. Commander Li immediately ran forward, and she grabbed his hands and hugged him tightly. Her tears flowed like a spring onto the commander's chest. This people's warrior, forged into a man of iron in twenty years of bloody war, could no longer hold back his own tears. After a long silence in the suffocating broken house, the old woman finally uttered a sentence.

　　"They were all killed by the White Party, Chengfang! Quickly lead the troops across the river and avenge me!"

　　给红军妈妈报仇
    苏策、卢忠
    打前站的到了麻城县李家河，向全村人民报告了一个惊人的消息，二十年前当红军的李成芳今天要回来了。
    大清早村口就拥满了人。他们等着，仰望着远远的绵延不绝的部队，走到行进着的人马跟前，向行列里辨认着每一副红黑的面孔。长满了胡子的“老革命”，喜悦的眼睛里都含满了泪。
    李成芳军长参加红军的时候才十六岁，还是个又瘦又小的孩子，只因为受不了国民党的罪，就当红军、闹革命直到如今。当他远远看到家乡的树、家乡的屋顶时，不禁兴奋起来了。见到自己家人该会怎样呢？见到熟人说些什么呢？在任何强大敌人面前他也没有这样紧张过。当他望见村口站满了人，他的眼睛湿润了。他一直走进人群中，高兴的打着招呼，仔细地看着每个人的面孔，心头却慢慢地收缩起来，一个也认不得了。好半天，他才看见一个老头子走上前来，颤声的说：“你就是成芳吗？”这是他的叔叔李清义。
    李军长被一大群人拥着进了房里去，小孩们围在身边笑着、跑着、跟在这位陌生的红军叔叔后面闹着。老年人却万分感慨起来。孩子长大了，带着队伍回来了，最后的胜利马上就要来到了。可是……
    李清义凑到军长身旁悲愤地说。“你们走了之后，白党（指国民党）把大别山压死了，民国二十一年三月间困死了你爹，七月间困死了你娘；全村十六家就被困死五十四人呀！第二年你妹妹也失落了，饿的谁也顾不上谁了。你家的房子也被白军给拆了……”
    老头子们领着他走到一片瓦砾场上指点着说：“还记得吗？这地方从前是你家的堂房，这是你吃饭的灶房。”当他指着长满荒草的一角时，手指禁不住颤抖起来：“你小时候就睡在那里啊！”
    李军长忙着跑去看一位同志的母亲，他的儿子和李军长一起参加革命，但早已牺牲了。屋里冷落的可怕，什么东西都被国民党匪帮＠蹋完了。破烂不堪的四壁被烟薰的漆黑，挂着一条条雨水冲注的水印，炉灶象是多年不生火了，满地灰尘，满屋蛛网。
    突然草堆里站起来一个瞎了眼睛的白发老婆婆，叫化子一样的褴褛。她用力呼喊着他的小名，李军长立刻跑向前去，她便拉着他的双手，然后又把他紧紧抱在怀里，她的眼泪象泉水一样滚流到军长的衣襟上。在二十年血战里锤炼成一铸铁人似的人民战士，再也忍不住自己的眼泪了。窒息的破房里半天才迸出老婆婆的一句话。
    “都叫白党杀光了，成芳！快带队伍打过江去，给我报仇呀！”
