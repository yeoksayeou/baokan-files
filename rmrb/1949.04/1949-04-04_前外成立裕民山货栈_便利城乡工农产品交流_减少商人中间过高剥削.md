　　Yumin Mountain Products Depot Established Outside Qianmen
    Facilitating Exchange of Agricultural and Industrial Products between Urban and Rural Areas, Reducing Excessive Exploitation by Merchants

    [Ping City News] In order to develop urban and rural production, facilitate the exchange of agricultural and industrial products, and reduce excessive exploitation by merchants, the Beijing Municipal Trade Company and the Pingxi Prefecture established the Yumin Mountain Products Depot at Shijia Hutong outside Qianmen in this city on March 27th (temporarily located in Zhonghe Loan Shop). It officially opened for business on the 28th. In the three days from the 28th to the 30th, more than 30 farmers came to the depot to sell goods, selling over 11,000 jin of almonds, peach kernels, and walnuts to the depot, with a total value of 340,000 RMB. Compared to selling in private cargo depots, farmers earned an additional 46,300 RMB, reducing exploitation by 13.6% of the total value of goods (because private cargo depots charge a 10% handling fee, while the public depot charges 3%; private depots deduct 7% on weighing, while the public depot deducts 12%. Purchase prices are also slightly higher at the public depot than at private depots). Farmers found it most convenient to sell their goods immediately upon arrival, without wasting time. Therefore, farmers are very satisfied with the Yumin Mountain Products Depot and plan to inform farmers in various regions to sell their goods at the depot, no longer suffering excessive exploitation by private cargo depots. At the same time, the Yumin Mountain Products Depot also obtained appropriate profits by transporting goods to Tianjin for sale. The depot is currently stepping up preparations to expand its business operations.

　　前外成立裕民山货栈
    便利城乡工农产品交流　减少商人中间过高剥削
    【平市讯】北平市贸易公司与平西专署为了发展城乡生产，便利农产品与工业品交流，减少商人中间过高剥削，特于三月二十七日在本市前门外施家胡同（暂住中和贷栈内）成立裕民山货栈，于二八十日已正式营业，二十八至三十日三天中，共来该栈售货农民三十余名，售给该栈杏仁、桃仁、核桃一万一千余斤，货款总值人民币三十四万元。较在私人货栈出售，农民多得人民币四万六千三百元，减少了货物总值百分之十三点六的剥削（因私人货栈手续费百分之十，公家百分之三，私人货栈出秤百分之七，公家出秤百分之十二。在收买价格上亦稍高私人货栈）。而农民最感便利的是随来随卖，不耽误时间，因此农民对裕民山货栈非常满意，并准备通知各地农民均来该栈卖货，不再受私人货栈的过高剥削。同时裕民山货栈将货运天津出售，亦得到适当的利润。现该栈正加紧筹备，准备扩大业务经营。
