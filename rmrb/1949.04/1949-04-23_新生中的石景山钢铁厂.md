The Reborn Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant

　　Taking a train from Xizhimen westward along the Pingmen line for about an hour, you can see rows of chimneys and coal smoke filling the air on both sides of the railway. This is the Shijingshan industrial zone. The largest iron and steel plant in Guannei, the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, is located on the south side of the road,靠着石景山,临着永定河, with various iron and steel giants and towering chimneys filling this vast plain of more than 300 acres. For the past three months, more than three thousand workers, with their initial awakening and a spirit of being masters of their own affairs, have been working diligently. Recently, the tall chimneys have been smoking one after another, and the iron and steel giants are awakening.

　　Looking back at the history of the iron and steel plant, it is stained with the blood and tears of the Chinese working class. Its establishment dates back to the time of the First World War, during the era of the Anfu clique warlords. Seeing the rise in steel prices due to the war, they colluded with Japanese imperialism, using the blood and sweat of the Chinese working class to build the first 250-ton blast furnace here, intending to use the iron ore from Longyan to make iron and manufacture guns and cannons as capital to consolidate their warlord rule and massacre the Chinese people. However, when the project was only 80 percent complete, the European war ended, and iron prices plummeted, making it impossible to continue construction. In the subsequent warlord wars, it was seized by the warlords one after another. However, due to the warlords' collusion with imperialists and betrayal of the country, they were inevitably unable to establish their own heavy industry. Finally, after the outbreak of the War of Resistance, it fell entirely into the hands of Japanese imperialists.

　　In order to rapidly plunder China's resources and use them to attack the Chinese people, thereby realizing their ambition to occupy China and even the whole world, Japanese imperialists used all kinds of cruel means to seize more than 300 acres of land from nearby farmers and started large-scale construction here. First, they moved the No. 2 380-ton blast furnace and the first 100 waste heat coke ovens from Japan. Later, they moved the No. 3 600-ton blast furnace and built the second 30-unit regenerative coke oven. They also added hundreds of indigenous coke ovens and eleven 20-ton small blast furnaces. Even more cruel, they deceived and recruited many Chinese workers, peasants, and many other poor people who were plundered by Japanese imperialists and had no way out, telling them that there was rice and flour for working here, and the wages were high. But once you arrived at the factory, they would confiscate your "ID card," and from then on, you couldn't think of leaving until you were drained of your blood and sweat and lay down. They would even strip off your ragged clothes and cover you with a handful of yellow earth, which they considered to be very "merciful." Many people were left by the roadside to feed wild dogs. It is said that at that time, there were as many as sixty or seventy thousand workers, and people died every day, the stench filled the air, it was simply a living hell. Wang Enbo, an employee of the coking plant, said: "Don't look at how well-built this factory is, how tall the factory buildings are, they are all built on the corpses of Chinese workers." Indeed, very few people were able to survive. The workers who are still here today cannot help but feel angry when they talk about the situation at that time. Tian Jinfeng, a mason, said angrily: "None of these beasts can be let go! But we finally waited for victory, and the Kuomintang let all these guys go back to their countries."

　　Starting from January 16th

　　The day of this great construction began on January 16th, because on that day, the sound of liberation gunfire rang out from the mountains opposite Shijingshan. By noon on the 17th, the Kuomintang bandits on the mountain shouted to surrender their guns. In just one day, Shijingshan was liberated. The largest iron and steel plant in North China, which had been built with the blood and corpses of Chinese workers, was finally returned to the Chinese working class and the Chinese people. An old worker in the power plant, who was fifty-seven years old, saw the People's Liberation Army and excitedly shouted repeatedly: "This is what it means to see our own people!"

　　After the People's Government took over, Comrade Chen Lei, the military representative, said to the workers at a meeting: "Now our workers are in charge, but this iron and steel plant is a poor inheritance." Indeed, it seems that there is a lot of property, with six factories including ironmaking, coking, power, casting, machinery repair, and chemical industry. However, the Kuomintang "ate big fish,摸小鱼,捞虾米", leaving the entire plant in disarray. The No. 2 380-ton blast furnace had hundreds of tons of slag and molten iron solidified inside because the Kuomintang receiving officials were busy "捞虾米" and forgot about it. The No. 3 600-ton blast furnace, even the two crane booms standing next to it had been idle for more than three years, exposed to sun and rain and rusted. The second 30-unit regenerative coke oven was not completed, and the Kuomintang simply dismantled the iron sheds and stole most of the parts. The tar plant and chemical plant (unfinished) were built by the Kuomintang, but that was out of necessity, to maintain the factory they had to use by-products to earn some money. The No. 1 250-ton blast furnace was also broken and had to have the furnace bottom and walls demolished and rebuilt with new bricks.

　　How to be masters of our own affairs?

　　The work of reorganizing and restoring this property still requires a long-term investment. But the workers of the iron and steel plant did not bow their heads in the face of difficulties. They immediately organized themselves into study groups to study culture, technology, and politics. In the first few days of February, more than one hundred and ten study groups were established, and a general discussion of the question of "how to be masters of our own affairs" was launched. The seventh group of the forging and welding plant discussed and said: "Being in charge is not a careless matter. If everyone in a family of four has different ideas, is not thrifty, does not work, or is extravagant, life will not be good." Therefore, they proposed: "We should endure hardships and work hard, overcome difficulties, unite, organize, persuade each other, improve production, and appropriately improve life," and also study "how to increase work efficiency? How to save materials? How to use waste materials?" After such study and discussion, the workers started working enthusiastically. Those without work found work to do, and those with work did overtime. All the restoration plans were completed ahead of schedule. The No. 1 blast furnace started construction on February 2nd and has been working for more than two months. Not only has the accumulated iron been excavated, but the work of laying bricks at the bottom of the furnace is also nearing completion. Hundreds of tons of slag and accumulated iron in the No. 2 blast furnace are also nearing excavation. The No. 1 coke oven was repaired and warmed up as early as February 1st, and the first group of 25 ovens will be able to produce coke around the 20th of this month. The coal washing plant was repaired and started operation on the 12th of this month, and now it can wash more than 200 tons of coal every day. Other examples include the coking plant which resumed production on February 26th, the foundry which also produced in February, and the power plant which started generating electricity in November...

　　"The world has really changed"

　　These facts of early completion are due to the workers' realization that they are the masters of the factory, and the complete transformation of their thinking, work attitude, and lifestyle. The following are some individual model examples, of which there are countless: Gao Yutong, Cao Zhiheng, Xu Yi, Tian Fengyin and other nine workers in the third boiler room repaired boilers No. 6 and 7 in 40 days,砌了七万块火砖, completing the planned project 20 days ahead of schedule. The workers who rushed to repair the ash 高道 in the strong wind said: "In the past, to repair this 高道, we planned to spend our whole lives on it, but now we can’t because we are working for ourselves, so we must complete it ahead of schedule." Yu Xiangkui, Chen Chuanding, and Meng Zhaosi, workers in the electrical repair room, saw that it was uneconomical to use British steel sheets to make fuse box copper covers, so they used copper末子 instead, and they also used old lathes to improve the technology, greatly increasing the work efficiency when sawing copper闸板 and cutting胶木管子. Li Shuanglin, Hu Wenqi, Wei Jinting and other workers in the locomotive room asked to overhaul locomotive C105 themselves... And the most strange thing is that some of these people who are actively producing used to be famous "泡将". According to Hu Wenqi himself, he was one of the most famous "泡将". When it was first liberated, he suspected that the Communist Party was really the vanguard of the working class, so he "转腰子" (hiding his loafing) when he saw the staff! Later, after participating in the group discussion, he came back and said: "This world has really changed. In the past, we were trampled underfoot by others and treated as non-humans, but now we have to make a name for ourselves in our work." He took the lead in repairing the locomotive and even went to Changxindian to borrow tools. Now he has to think about the work for the next day every day when he goes home and often calls everyone to a meeting to discuss work.

　　Indeed, the world has changed. Our iron and steel plant workers have not only begun to establish a new labor attitude at work, but their lifestyle has also changed. One or twenty workers live in Chibei Village. In the past, besides playing cards and drinking, they would "咪" (meaning to shut themselves) on the 炕 when they got home, ignoring each other and never visiting each other's homes. But now it's become lively, with meetings at Zhang's house today and dramas rehearsing at Li's house tomorrow. Wen Kai from the train driver's field said: "I used to be a top drinker, but now I don't have time."

　　Several Issues to be Resolved Urgently

　　Why can't the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant be fully operational? Because there are still some urgent issues that need to be resolved:

　　1. First is the funding problem: Many departments of the iron and steel plant still need to be repaired and constructed, which requires a large amount of investment.

　　2. Raw material problem: The raw material problem is quite serious. The main raw materials of the ironmaking plant are iron ore, coal, and limestone. Among them, coal is relatively less of a problem, but because of the extreme shortage of train cars, it cannot be transported in large quantities, which greatly affects the coking work. The most problematic is ore sand. Originally, ore sand was purchased from the Longyan Iron Mine, but the main mine, Pangjiabao Mine, has been completely destroyed. Now we can only use the Yantongshan Mine, but the Yantongshan Mine does not have mechanical equipment and has been abandoned for a long time. Now people have been sent to plan to expand mining, and it is estimated that it will take two months before it can supply the needs of the No. 1 blast furnace.

　　3. Equipment problem: The iron and steel plant has many unfinished buildings that need to be repaired and constructed, so a large amount of equipment must be prepared. Moreover, to guarantee the source of raw materials, the railway must be repaired immediately, so sleepers are also urgently needed materials.

　　4. Organization and talent problem: The existing organization is a bureaucratic organization left over from the Kuomintang. In many places, it is an empty organization established based on people, and in many places, it is filled with incompetent administrators. Many incompetent foremen who relied on special forces in the past still exist. These organizations and personnel are not suitable for the needs of the enterprise, and even hinder the expansion of production, so they must be modified and adjusted. In terms of technical talent, it must be further strengthened before we can design the construction and production of the entire factory.

　　5. Supply and sales problem: To restore and expand production, we must first ensure that the products have a market and must cooperate with other construction undertakings. For example, the pipe casting department of the foundry does not dare to resume production because there is nowhere to sell the manufactured water pipes. In fact, water pipes are indispensable for building cities and factories. If we are to have a comprehensive construction plan, these two leading pipe-making machines in Guannei will certainly be very popular. (Zhang Jiachi)

　　新生中的石景山钢铁厂
    从西直门搭火车沿平门线往西，约莫一小时的路程，在车上可以看到铁路两旁烟突林立，煤烟漫天，这就是石景山工厂区了。关内规模最大的石景山钢铁厂就在路南，靠着石景山，临着永定河，各式各样的钢铁巨人和耸入云霄的烟突布满在这块三百余亩的广大平原上，三个月来，经过三千多个已经有了初步觉悟的职工们，以当家作主的精神辛勤工作，高大的烟突最近已一个接着一个冒出了烟，钢铁巨人在苏醒了。
    翻一翻钢铁厂历史，涂满了中国工人阶级的鲜血和眼泪。它的成立早在第一次欧战的时候，当时正是安福系的军阀统治时代，看到了因战争而钢铁涨价，就勾结了日本帝国主义，用中国工人阶级的血汗，在这儿建立起第一号二百五十吨的炼铁炉，预备用龙烟的铁矿在这儿炼铁制造枪炮，作为巩固其军阀统治，屠杀中国人民的本钱，可是工程只完成了百分之八十，欧战已停，铁价大落，修不起来了。在以后的军阀的战争里，它又被军阀们夺来夺去，可是由于军阀们的勾结帝国主义者，出卖国家，必然建立不起来自己的重工业，最后终于在抗战爆发后全部落入日本帝国主义者的手里。
    日本帝国主义者为了迅速掠夺中国的资源，作为进攻中国人民，从而实现其占领中国以至全世界的野心，就用尽一切残酷的手段，强占附近农民土地三百余亩，在这儿大兴土木建设起来，先由其本国移来第二号三百八十吨炼铁炉和第一号废热式炼焦炉一百只，后来又移来第三号六百吨炼铁炉和建筑第二号蓄热式炼焦炉三十只，并且还增加了几百只土法炼焦炉和十一只二十吨小型炼铁炉，而更残酷的是他们从各地用欺骗手段，募来许多中国工人、农民，和其他许多被日本帝国主义者掠夺得走头无路的贫苦老百姓，说来这儿做活有米有面，工资有多高，可是一到厂里，就把你“身份证”搜了去，从此你就休想出去，直到你被榨尽了血汗躺了下来，还要剥光你的破烂衣服，盖一把黄土，据说就很“仁慈”的了，多少人给丢在路旁沟里喂野狗。据说当时工人最多到过六七万，天天死人，臭气冲天，简直是一座人间地狱。炼焦炉的一个职员王恩波说：“你别瞧这厂子建筑多好，厂房多高大，可都是中国工人的尸首垫起来的啊”。真的，能熬过来的人已经很少了，现在还在的工人们一谈起当时的情形就止不住心头的愤怒。瓦匠工田金凤愤愤地说：“这些野兽们可一个也不能把他们放回去！可是我们好容易盼到胜利了，国民党倒把这些家伙希里呼噜全放回去了”。
    一月十六日开始
    这伟大建设的日子是从一月十六日开始的，因为在那天，解放的枪声从石景山对面的山头上响起来。到十七日中午的时候，山上国民党匪军就喊交枪了。只一天工夫，石景山解放了，曾经以中国工人的血汗和尸身建筑起来的华北最大的钢铁厂，终于还给了中国工人阶级和中国人民。一位五十七岁的电力厂老工人见着了解放军，兴奋得连连喊着：“这才见着亲人啦！”
    在人民政府接管之后，军事代表陈雷同志在某次会上对职工们说：“现在咱们工人自己当家了，可是这钢铁厂却是一份穷家当。”的确，看起来似乎家当还不少，有炼铁、炼焦、电力、铸造、机械修理、化工等六个工厂，可是给国民党“吃大鱼、摸小鱼、捞虾米”，弄得全厂七零八落：第二号三百八十吨炼铁炉几百吨矿渣和铁水，因国民党接收大员忙着“捞虾米”而忘了它，结果全凝固在里面了。第三号六百吨炼铁炉，连它旁边竖着的两个起重吊杆也空站了三年多，日晒雨打已经锈蚀了。第二号蓄热式炼焦炉三十只也没有完成，国民党干脆连铁棚都拆了，零件也大多偷走了。焦油场和化工厂（未完成）算是国民党建造的，可是那是不得已，要维持工厂不得不利用副产品来赚几个钱。第一号二百五十吨炼铁炉也坏了，得拆除炉底、壁重炉新垒砖。……
    怎样当家作主人？
    这一份家当的整理修复工作还需要长期下本钱去做。但是钢铁厂的职工们并没在困难面前低头，他们立刻自己组织了学习小组，学习起文化、技术、政治来，在二月初的几天工夫里，一下成立了一百一十几个学习小组，普遍展开了讨论“怎样当家”的问题。锻焊厂第七小组讨论的结果说：“当家不是件马虎事，一家四口如果每人心里不同，有不勤俭的，不劳动的，或奢侈的，日子不会过的好”。所以他们提出：“应当吃苦耐劳，克服困难，团结起来，组织起来，彼此规劝，提高生产，适当改善生活”，而且还要研究“怎么能增加工作效率？怎样节省材料？怎样利用废料？”经过这样学习讨论之后，职工们就轰轰烈烈地干起来了。没有活的找活干，有活干的加班干。所有修复的计划都提前完成了；第一号炼铁炉自二月二日开始动工至今，只两个多月，非但挖出了积铁，炉底砌砖工作也快完成了。第二号炼铁炉内几百吨矿渣积铁也快挖完了。第一号炼焦炉则早在二月一日就修好温炉，本月二十日左右第一组炉二十五只就可以出焦。洗煤场是本月十二日修好开工的，现在每天可洗煤二百多吨，其他如炼焦厂是二月二十六日恢复生产的，铸造厂也是二月里就生产的，电力厂是十一月开始发电的……
    “这天下可真的变了”
    这种种提前完工的事实，是由于工人们已经认识到自己是工厂的主人，从思想到工作态度生活态度上的全部转变，以下是一些个别的模范举例，这些例子是多得数不清的：三锅炉房工友高玉彤、曹之恒、徐毅、田凤银等九人在四十天内修好了六、七两号锅炉，共砌了七万块火砖，将预定计划提前二十天。在大风里赶修出灰高道的工友们说：“过去要修这个高道，就打算吃上它一辈子啦，现在给自己干可不了，准得提前完成它”。电气修理房工友于相魁、陈传鼎、孟兆思三人看到用英国货的钢片来做保险盒铜盖太不经济，就用铜末子来代替，而且他们还利用旧车床改进技术，在锯铜闸板时在切胶木管子时，工作效率都大大提高了。机车房的工友李双林、胡文起、魏金亭等要求自己大修Ｃ一○五号火车头……而最奇怪的是这些积极生产的人过去有些却是有名的“泡将”。据胡文起自己说，他就是很有名的“泡将”之一，咋一解放的时候，他还怀疑共产党是否真是工人阶级的先锋队，见了工作人员就“转腰子”（隐藏他的磨洋工）！后来参加了小组讨论，回来说：“这个天下可真的变了，过去咱们给人家踩在脚底下不当人，现在可要在干活儿上出出头了”。就打头发起修理火车头来，而且还亲自到长辛店借工具。现在他每天回家都得捉摸捉摸第二天的活计，常常找大伙儿开会讨论工作。
    真的，这天下变了，我们钢铁厂的工人们不但在工作开始建立起新的劳动态度，而且生活方式也变了。池北村住着一二十家工人，过去除了打牌喝酒外，一回家就“咪”（闷的意思）在炕上，谁也不理睬谁，谁也不到谁家去串门儿。可是现在却热闹起来了，不是今天在张家开会，就是明天在李家排话剧，火车司机场开文说：“过去我是顶会喝酒的，现在可没工夫了。”
    急待解决的几个问题
    石景山钢铁厂为什么不能全部开工呢？因为现在还存在着一些急待解决的问题：
    一、首先是资金问题：钢铁厂还有许多部门要修理，要建设，还必须大量投进去。
    二、原料问题：原料问题是相当严重的，炼铁厂的主要原料是铁矿，煤，和石灰石，其中煤是比较没有问题，但因车皮奇缺，不能大量运来，因此使炼焦工作大受影响，而最成问题的要算矿砂了。原来矿砂贩自龙烟铁矿，但主要的矿山庞家堡矿场已全部破坏，现在只能用烟筒山的矿场，可是烟筒山矿场没有机械设备，久已弃置不用。现在已派人去计划扩大开采，估计要两个月后才可以供给一号炼铁炉开炉的需要。
    三、器材问题：钢铁厂有许多未完成的建筑，都需要修整建筑，因此必须准备大量器材，而且在保证原料来源上，必须立即修好铁路，因此枕木也是迫切需要的材料。
    四、机构与人才问题：现有的机构是国民党遗留下来的官僚机构，它有许多地方是因人设事的空机构，也有许多地方充塞着许多不能称职的管理员，许多过去不称职的依靠特殊势力的工头还存在着，这些机构和人事，都是不适合企业要求，甚至还是阻碍扩大生产的东西，必须加以修改和调整。在技术人才方面，必须再加强，然后才能设计整个工厂的建设和生产。
    五、供销问题：恢复并扩大生产，必须先保证其产品有市场，必须和其他多方面的建设事业配合，如铸造厂的铸管部，由于制成的水管没处销，所以不敢恢复生产，而实际上，水管是建设城市和工厂所不可少的东西，如果我们要全盘的建设计划，这两部关内数一数二的制管机是一定很出风的。（张家炽）
