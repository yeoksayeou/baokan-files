The Development of Cooperative Undertakings in Tianjin

Thirty-five cooperatives established in two months

Under the leadership of the Tianjin Municipal Supply and Marketing Cooperative, the cooperative undertakings in Tianjin have developed considerably in the past two months. As of March 21, a total of thirty-five employee consumer cooperatives and citizen consumer cooperatives have been established in the city, with a total of 68,307 members. The vast majority of the members are family members of workers. According to the statistics of thirty-three cooperatives, the members have subscribed a total of 60,399 and a half shares, with a total share capital of 1,910,190 people's currency yuan, and 9,771 catties of corn flour. From February 1 to March 20, the Cooperative sold a total of 1,260,477 catties of grain, including white flour, millet, corn, and corn flour, to the cooperatives at low prices. Among them, coarse grains were 20% lower than the market price, and refined grains were 4% lower than the market price, saving members a total of more than 1 million people's currency yuan from exploitation by middlemen. According to the grain sales statistics of sixteen cooperatives, 52,212 members purchased grain, with an average saving of 43.7 yuan per person. If a family of five is counted, it can save 218.5 yuan. If estimated at 15 yuan per catty of corn flour, the savings for a family of five can buy 14 and a half catties of corn flour, enough to sustain one person for ten days. Due to the correct business policy of the cooperative, which truly benefits the members, workers and citizens generally demand the organization of consumer cooperatives. Some unemployed workers and small handicraft workers, some with tools but without raw materials, and some lacking capital, all demand the establishment of production cooperatives. From February 15 to March 20, a total of twenty-four cooperatives registered with the General Cooperative requesting to form cooperatives, of which ten are currently being organized (seven consumer cooperatives, three production cooperatives), and fourteen are requesting to be organized or transformed (five consumer cooperatives, nine production cooperatives).

Masses urgently demand the establishment of cooperatives

Before liberation, the lives of many workers and poor citizens in Tianjin were extremely difficult, often working one day to buy food for the next, and thus suffered the most from the exploitation of middlemen. After liberation, they urgently demanded the establishment of cooperatives to supply daily necessities. Initially, some factories, under the leadership of the employee work groups, organized temporary institutions for rationing grain and salt; some district street residents also organized several consumer cooperatives either with the help of the district government or spontaneously. Then, the Supply and Marketing Cooperative formed six working groups and went to the North Station, East Station, Jibei Power Company, China Textile Factories 1 and 2, and District 8, etc., to start establishing cooperatives with emphasis. In the process of establishing cooperatives, the working group members first explained to the employees and citizens the essential differences between the old and new cooperatives, pointing out that the cooperatives in the Kuomintang ruling era were corrupt and self-serving institutions for the Kuomintang reactionary government to deceive and exploit the people; the new cooperatives established now are mass economic organizations that serve the members and reduce intermediate exploitation. Under the support of state-owned trade agencies, this kind of cooperative is managed by the members themselves and supplies the members with daily necessities at low prices. After such publicity work, the working group members gradually established cooperatives through the active elements among the employees or the production groups among the citizens, and the members elected the cooperative affairs committee or the person in charge of management. In order to facilitate the employees and citizens to join the cooperative, the East Station Railway Employee Consumer Cooperative and the Twenty-Seventh Street Citizen Consumer Cooperative in District 8, etc., adopted the method of paying shares in installments, so that employees and poor citizens who could not take out all the shares at once also had the opportunity to join the cooperative. The things rationed by the cooperative are generally lower than the market price, thus gradually making employees and citizens have a correct understanding and trust in the cooperative. The East Station Cooperative has more than 18,000 members, including employees and family members from more than ten units such as the engineering section and the inspection section, and is the first and largest employee cooperative established in Tianjin. The Twenty-Seventh Street Citizen Consumer Cooperative in District 8 has developed extremely rapidly with the support of the General Cooperative. As of March 16, the number of members has increased from 608 at the beginning to 2,500, accounting for more than one-third of the residents of the entire street.

Experience and lessons in work

In this stage of establishing cooperatives, the Tianjin Municipal Supply and Marketing Cooperative has gained considerable experience, improved the ability of cadres to organize cooperatives, discovered and cultivated a large number of active elements, and laid the foundation for the next stage of work. In the organization process of employee cooperatives, it has also learned to use the existing organizations of workers and conduct short-term training for active elements to make them powerful assistants in the work of organizing cooperatives, which are all done relatively well. But on the other hand, in individual cooperatives, especially in many spontaneously organized cooperatives, there are still many incorrect views among the members, such as some people regard the cooperative as a simple relief institution, unwilling to pay shares, and even less concerned about the success or failure of the cooperative, holding the idea of "buy if it's cheap, don't buy if it's not cheap." Some cooperatives, due to the rumors and sabotage of some bad elements, have caused some masses to have some doubts about organizing cooperatives, and many people withdraw their shares halfway, or only one person in a family of five or six joins the cooperative as a test. The Citizen Cooperative of Twenty-Ninth Street in District 8, due to the weak leadership, allowed destructive elements to usurp the leadership, which caused losses to the work. Some cooperatives are also taken advantage of by merchants. Merchants use the name of the cooperative to seek profit, making the cooperative a disguised commercial institution. For example, the Limin Transport and Sales Cooperative in District 2 is actually a warehouse.

Summarizing this stage of cooperative establishment, the Supply and Marketing Cooperative has gained the following experiences: (1) Cooperatives should be established with emphasis, planning, and leadership, to prevent blindness and spontaneous tendencies. In selecting key points, two conditions must be based on: one is that the masses urgently demand organization, and the other is that the mass work is better and a considerable number of active elements have been discovered. In the establishment of cooperatives, the working group should maintain close contact with the General Cooperative, seize the leadership, take the active elements as the backbone, give full play to the strength of the masses, carefully calculate the business, and carefully select and appoint management personnel who are enthusiastic to serve the members and are supported by the masses. For the members, it is necessary to eliminate their view of simply enjoying rights without caring for the cooperative, so that they fully realize that the cooperative is their own organization, and should support the operation of the cooperative when prices fluctuate, so that it can be consolidated and developed. (2) The work of establishing cooperatives should start with consumer cooperatives first. The organization objects of consumer cooperatives should currently focus on employees, poor citizens, coolies, and small handicraft workers, especially starting with employees of state-owned enterprises first, and then absorbing other working people to participate. In the organization process, a meeting of active elements should first be held to discuss the significance of establishing a cooperative, propose the principles of no dividends and no credit, and educate the masses through them. Then, the members voluntarily form groups, discuss the conditions of the member representatives and conduct elections, and then mutually recommend cooperative affairs committee members from the representatives to produce the director of the cooperative. (3) Members join the cooperative on a per-person basis, not on a per-family basis, and subscribe to shares, at least one share per person, with no limit to the maximum. The amount of shares must be unified for each unit of the cooperative. (4) The business operation of the consumer cooperative should be based on the most urgent needs of the majority of members at present. (5) The General Cooperative or the economic section of the district government should review the cooperatives spontaneously organized by the masses, and handle them separately according to the specific circumstances. Those that can be transformed can be transformed in accordance with the articles of association. Those that do not conform to the organizational charter of the cooperative shall not use the name of the cooperative.

As for production and supply and marketing cooperatives other than consumer cooperatives, the General Cooperative has decided to carry out preliminary organizational work first in order to gain experience before promoting them.

　　天津市合作事业的发展
  　两月建社三十五个
    天津市的合作事业，在市供销合作总社的领导下，两个月来有了相当的发展。截至三月二十一日止，全市共建立了职工消费合作社和市民消费合作社三十五个，共吸收社员六万八千三百零七人。社员中绝大多数是工人家属。据三十三个社的统计，社员共认购六万零三百九十九股半，计股金人民券一百九十一万零一百九十元，又玉米面九千七百七十一斤。自二月一日至三月二十日为止，合作总社共以低价售给各社粮食计白面、小米、玉米、玉米面等共一百二十六万零四百七十七斤。其中粗粮较市价低百分之二十，细粮较市价低百分之四，总共使社员少受中间商人剥削达人民券一百余万元。根据十六个社售粮统计，有五万二千二百一十二个社员购得粮食，平均每人可节省四十三元七角，一家以五口人计，可节省二百一十八元五角。如以玉米面一斤十五元估计，则一家五口所节省数可购玉米面十四斤半，足够维持一个人十天的生活。由于合作社业务方针正确，使社员真正得到好处，所以职工和市民普遍要求组织消费合作社。有些失业工人和小手工业工人，有的有工具没有原料，有的缺乏资本，都要求建立生产社。自二月十五日至三月二十日，到总社登记要求组社的共有二十四个合作社，其中现已着手组织的有十个（消费社七，生产社三），要求组社或改造的有十四个（消费社五，生产社九）。
    群众迫切要求建社
    解放前，津市许多工人和贫苦市民生活极为困苦，经常是做一天活买一天吃，因而受中间商人的剥削最重。解放后，他们迫切要求建立合作社，供应生活必需品。最初，有的工厂在职工工作组领导下，组织了配售粮食、食盐的临时机构；有的区街市民也或由区政府帮助或自发地组织了若干消费合作社。接着供销合作总社组成六个工作小组分赴北站、东站、冀北电力公司、中纺一、二厂及八区等地，有重点地开始建社。在建社过程中，工作组人员首先向职工及市民讲解新旧合作社在本质上的区别，指出国民党统治时代的合作社，是国民党反动政府欺骗和剥削人民的贪污自肥的机构；现在成立的新的合作社，则是为社员服务，减少中间剥削的群众自己的经济组织。这种合作社在国营贸易机关的扶植下，由社员自己管理，以低价供给社员的日用生活必需品。经过这样的宣传工作之后，工作小组人员即经由职工中的积极分子或市民中的生产小组，逐步成立合作社，由社员选举社务委员会或负责经营的人。为了便利职工、市民入社，东站铁路职工消费合作社和八区二十七街市民消费合作社等，都采用分期缴纳股金的办法，使不能一次拿出全部股金的职工和贫苦市民也有入社的机会。合作社配售的东西，一般都较市价为低，因而逐渐使职工和市民对合作社有了正确的认识和信赖。东站合作社拥有社员一万八千余人，包括工务段、检车段等十多个单位的职工和家属，是津市第一个建立的规模最大的职工合作社。八区二十七街市民消费合作社，在总社的支持下，发展极为迅速。截至三月十六日止，社员人数已由开始时的六百零八人增至二千五百人，占全街居民的三分之一强。
    工作中的经验教训
    津市供销合作社总社在这一阶段的建社工作中，取得了相当的经验，提高了干部的组社能力，发现和培养了大批积极分子，打下了下一阶段的工作基础。在职工合作社的组织过程中，又学会了运用工人已有的组织，并对积极分子进行短期训练，使之成为组社工作中的有力助手，这些都是做得比较好的方面。但另一方面，个别的合作社，特别是许多自发组织起来的合作社，社员中还存在着不少的错误观点，如有些人把合作社看作是单纯的救济机构，不愿缴纳股金，更不关心合作社的成败，抱着“东西便宜就买，不便宜就不买”的想法。有的合作社由于一些坏分子的造谣破坏，使有些群众对组织合作社发生某些疑虑，不少人中途退股，或是一家五六口人中只有一人入社，作为试探。八区二十九街市民合作社则因领导力量薄弱，让破坏分子纂夺了领导权，使工作受到了损失。也有的合作社被商人钻隙利用。商人擅用合作社的名义谋利，使合作社成为变相的商业机构。如二区利民运销合作社实际上便是货栈性质。
    总结这一阶段的建社工作，供销合作总社得到下列一些经验：（一）合作社应有重点、有计划、有领导地去建立，防止盲目性与自流倾向。在选择重点时，必须根据两个条件，一是群众迫切要求组织，另一是群众工作较好且已发现相当数量的积极分子。在建社中，工作组应密切与总社取得联系，抓紧领导，以积极分子为骨干，充分发挥群众力量，精密计算业务，慎重选择与任用热心为社员服务并为群众拥护的经营人员。对于社员，则要消除其单纯享受权利而不爱护合作社的观点，使其充分认识到合作社是自己的组织，在物价波动时应支持合作社的经营，使其得到巩固和发展。（二）建社工作应先从消费合作社着手。消费合作社的组织对象，目前应以职工、贫苦市民、苦力及小手工业者为核心，特别是先从公营企业的职工着手，然后再吸收其他劳动人民参加。在组织过程中，首先应召开积极分子会议，讨论建社的意义，提出不分红、不赊帐等原则，通过他们对群众进行教育。然后由社员自愿结成小组，讨论社员代表的条件并进行选举，再从代表中互推社务委员，产生社主任。（三）社员入社以人为单位，不以家庭为单位，认购股份，每人至少一股，多则不限。股金多少，每个单位社必须统一。（四）消费合作社的业务经营，应以当前多数社员最迫切的需要为根据。（五）群众自发组织起来的合作社，总社或区政府经济股应进行审查，根据具体情况分别处理。可能改造者可依据社章予以改造。不合于合作社组织章程者，不得用合作社名义。
    至于消费合作社以外的生产与供销合作社，总社决定先进行初步组织工作，以便取得经验，再行推广。
