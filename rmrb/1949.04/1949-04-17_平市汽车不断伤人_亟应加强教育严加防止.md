Beiping Car Accidents Continuously Injure People: Urgent Need to Strengthen Education and Strictly Prevent Accidents

[Our Newspaper] Car accident incidents in this city have continued to occur recently, greatly impacting traffic order. The majority of cars causing accidents are military vehicles. The main reasons for the accidents are careless driving, excessive speed, and cars or pedestrians failing to obey traffic directions. Just the day before yesterday (the 15th), two car accidents occurred. At 10:40 AM the day before yesterday, a jeep belonging to the PLA Unit 165, in order to avoid a soldier at the west entrance of Shuaifuyuan, mistakenly撞倒 crashed into a rickshaw coming from the opposite direction, injuring the rickshaw driver Zhu Zhende. Upon hearing the news, the unit immediately took responsibility for Zhu Zhende's medical treatment, and the matter has been resolved. At approximately 5:00 AM the day before yesterday, rickshaw driver Zhang Maoen was pulling a passenger at the south entrance of Bamiancao when he was hit by a military truck and overturned. Zhang Maoen suffered injuries to his face, hands, and feet, and was briefly unconscious. The passenger also suffered minor injuries. After causing the accident, the truck not only failed to provide assistance to the injured but instead fled the scene. Another rickshaw driver, Guan Chunfang, upon witnessing this, immediately gave chase in his own rickshaw, catching up with the truck near Qianmen. He saw that the truck's number was "51386" and the truck was green. The local rickshaw trade association has already reported the situation to the Public Security Bureau, which is coordinating with relevant departments to investigate the matter.

　　平市汽车不断伤人
  　亟应加强教育严加防止
    【本报讯】本市汽车肇祸事件，近仍不时发生，影响交通秩序甚巨。肇祸汽车多数为军车。肇祸原因主要是驾驶不慎，车行过速，汽车或行人不服从交通指挥。仅前（十五）日即发生车祸两起。前日上午十时四十分，解放军一六五部队小吉普一辆，在帅府园西口因躲闪一军人，误将对面驶来的一辆三轮车撞倒，车夫朱振德负伤。部队闻讯，当即负责为朱振德医治，此事已得解决。前日上午五时许，三轮车夫张茂恩拉一乘客，在八面槽南口被一军用卡车撞翻，张茂恩脸、手、足均被摔伤，一度昏迷，乘客亦受微伤。卡车肇祸后，非但没有救治负伤者，反私行逃逸，另一三轮车夫关春芳见状，立即乘车追赶，在前门附近追及该车，看见该车号码为“五一三八六”号，车身为绿色。该区车业公会已将经过情形报告公安局，公安局正会同有关方面追办中。
