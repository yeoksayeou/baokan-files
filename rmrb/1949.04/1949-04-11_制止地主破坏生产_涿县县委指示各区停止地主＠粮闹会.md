　　Prevent Landlords from Sabotaging Production
  　Zhuoxian County Party Committee Directs All Districts to Stop Landlords from Demanding Grain to Fund Performances
    [Zhangjiakou News] During the busy spring season, landlords in some villages in the first district of Zhuoxian County, under the guise of old gatherings, organized stilt walking performances and gong and drum troupes, demanding large quantities of grain from the masses, thereby sabotaging production. Landlords in Dongzhang Village demanded one *shi* of grain from better-off households and one *dou* from smaller households. Landlords in Baitacun Village demanded 25 *shi* of grain and 900 yuan (People's Currency) to buy musical instruments, luring some people to learn, which delayed production. After discovering this, the County Party Committee immediately instructed all districts to stop it, educating the masses to recognize the landlords' conspiracy to sabotage production and not to be fooled, and to focus on production. Furthermore, strict action should be taken against those landlords engaging in sabotage activities. The handling of the demanded grain: return it to middle and poor peasants; hand it over to the farmers' association if it belongs to the landlords.
