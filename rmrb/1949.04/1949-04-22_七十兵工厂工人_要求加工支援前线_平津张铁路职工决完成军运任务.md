　　Seventy Ordnance Factory Workers
    Demand Increased Production to Support the Frontlines
  　Pingjin-Zhang Railway Workers Determined to Complete Military Transport Tasks
    The news of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu issuing the order to advance reached the Seventy Ordnance Factory in Ping City, the Pingjin Railway Bureau, the First Ordnance Repair Shop, the Fourth Ordnance Repair Shop, and other factories. The workers unanimously expressed that they would support the People's Liberation Army with practical actions of striving to increase production. The Seventy Ordnance Factory notified each workshop via telephone and blackboard bulletin. Many workers proposed starting work half an hour earlier and finishing half an hour later to support the People's Liberation Army. Workers in the fitter department put down their wrenches upon hearing the news, angrily saying, "Good! If they don't submit, we'll fight!" Guo Hua said, "The Kuomintang reactionaries are not sincerely negotiating, but are using false peace as a cover to buy time, scheming in secret with American imperialism to plot new conspiracies." Hu Yude, Zhang Wenrui, and others said, "If they don't want peace, we will fight to the end, without leniency! We workers in the rear will work hard to produce and support the People's Liberation Army's advance!" At the Pingjin Railway Bureau workers' representative forum, He Quanshan, a worker representative from Zhangjiakou, said, "Now that Chairman Mao has ordered the People's Liberation Army to advance, this is precisely the urgent hope and demand of the people of the whole country. Only by liberating all of China will there be true peace." Wu Xijun, a railway worker from Beijing East Station, said, "The people of Jiangnan have long been waiting for the People's Liberation Army to arrive. They must be very happy to hear this news. We railway workers must work hard to step up military transport. We believe that the victory of the whole country will soon be realized." Finally, one hundred and fifty worker representatives, representing five hundred railway workers from one hundred and sixty-one units in Beijing, Tianjin, and Zhangjiakou, unanimously passed a resolution supporting the order of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, guaranteeing the completion of the glorious task of military transport, in order to strive for the rapid victory of the national people's liberation war.
    The preparatory committee of the Beijing Municipal Federation of Trade Unions issued a statement on behalf of all the workers in the city, supporting the orders issued by Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, stating in brief: We, the entire workforce of Beijing, are extremely indignant at the deceptive behavior of the Chiang Kai-shek clique. We must work hard to produce and support the front lines. We demand that our armed comrades quickly cross the river, capture every incorrigible war criminal alive, and hand them over to the people for trial. When the workers of the People's Paper Mill heard that the Nanjing government had rejected the domestic peace agreement, everyone clamored about it. Lu Huazhang, a warehouse worker, said, "The Kuomintang reactionaries are always pulling this trick. There is nothing to say now, just cross the river and capture old Chiang at Xikou!" Zhang Zhenyu, a papermaking worker, said, "If the Kuomintang refuses to sign, we can only resolutely carry out the orders of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and fight them until they surrender."

　　七十兵工厂工人
    要求加工支援前线
  　平津张铁路职工决完成军运任务
    毛主席、朱总司令发布进军命令的消息，传到平市七十兵工厂、平津铁路局、第一修械所、第四修械所等工厂后，工人们一致表示：决以努力增加生产的实际行动，来支援人民解放军。七十兵工厂用电话、黑板报通知了各工作间，许多工人提出要早上班、晚下班各半点钟来支援解放军。钳工部的工人听到消息后，把钳子一放，气愤地说：“好！他不服咱就干！”国华说：“国民党反动派并不是实心谈判，而是用假和平打掩护，拖时间，好在背地里与美帝国主义计划新的阴谋。”胡玉德、张文瑞等说：“他不愿和平，咱们就打到底，没有客气！咱们工人后方努力生产支援人民解放军前进！”平津铁路局职工代表座谈会上，张家口工人代表何泉山说：“现在毛主席下令解放军前进，这正是全国人民迫切的希望与要求，只有解放全中国才会有真正的和平。”北平东车站铁路工人吴锡浚说：“江南人民早就盼望解放军去了，他们听到这个消息一定很高兴。我们铁路工人一定要努力加紧军事运输，我们相信全国的胜利很快就能实现。”最后一百五十个职工代表，代表着北平、天津、张家口三地一百六十一个单位的五万铁路职工，一致通过拥护毛主席、朱总司令命令，保证完成军事运输的光荣任务，以争取全国人民解放战争的迅速胜利。
    北平市职工总会筹备会代表全市工人发表声明，拥护毛主席、朱总司令发布的命令，略称：我们全北平的职工对蒋匪死党的欺骗行为万分愤激。我们要努力生产，支援前线。我们要求我们的武装同志迅速渡江，活捉每一个怙恶不悛的战争罪犯，交给人民审判。人民造纸厂工人听到南京政府竟拒绝国内和平协定后，大家都嚷了起来，仓库工人卢华章说：“国民党反动派老是来这一套，现在没有什么可说的，干脆渡江，到溪口捉老蒋就是！”造纸工人张振宇说：“国民党不肯签字，只有坚决执行毛主席、朱总司令的命令，打得他们投降为止。”
