Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, April 14th: While representatives of the Kuomintang government are in Beiping holding peace talks with the Chinese Communist Party, the Kuomintang air force continues to indiscriminately bomb various towns and cities in the liberated areas. At approximately 2:00 PM on the 11th, one Kuomintang P-51 aircraft and two Canadian-made Mosquito aircraft bombed and strafed Hefei City, Anhui Province, dropping several large incendiary bombs, killing one resident, injuring three, and burning down over 140 civilian houses. On the morning of the 10th, two Kuomintang aircraft circled and strafed Xuzhou, killing one person. In March alone, according to incomplete statistics from the Subei region, Kuomintang aircraft made a total of 76 sorties in 15 bombings of the area, averaging more than five aircraft each time, killing 44 residents in various locations, injuring 66, and destroying 40 civilian boats and 158 civilian houses. Fangjiapu, outside the South Gate of Yangzhou City, was bombed and strafed on March 9th, resulting in the deaths of six residents and injuries to three in one instance. On the 17th of the same month, six Kuomintang bombers indiscriminately bombed Taizhou City, killing 12 residents, injuring nine, and destroying nine civilian boats. In addition, areas along the Grand Canal such as Rugao, Hai'an, Taixing, and Jingjiang were bombed an average of more than twice a day, with the bombings of Jingjiang and Taixing being particularly frequent. The Kuomintang air force's mad bombing of towns and cities in the liberated areas fully demonstrates the die-hard persistence of Jiang Jieshi's followers in their evil ways.

　　和谈期间
  　国民党飞机滥炸解放区
    【新华社北平十四日电】国民党政府派出代表来北平与中国共产党举行和平谈判的时候，国民党的空军却继续滥炸解放区各城镇。十一日下午二时许，国民党飞机（Ｐ５１）型一架，加拿大造蚊式机两架轰炸扫射安徽合肥城，投掷大型燃烧弹数枚，炸死居民一人，炸伤三人，烧毁民房一百四十余间。十日上午，徐州市遭国民党飞机两架盘旋扫射，死一人。在三月份内，仅据苏北区一地的不完全统计，在对该区的十五次轰炸中，出动的国民党飞机即共达七十六架，平均每次在五架以上，炸死各地居民四十四人，炸伤六十六人，炸毁民船四十艘，民房一百五十八间。扬州市南门外方家铺在三月九日被轰炸扫射时，一次即死居民六人，伤三人。同月十七日国民党轰炸机六架滥炸泰州城，死居民十二人，伤九人，毁民船九艘。此外，运河沿线之如皋、海安、泰兴、静江等地，平均每日被炸两次以上，对静江、泰兴两地的轰炸，尤为频繁。国民党空军对解放区城镇的疯狂轰炸，充分说明了蒋介石死党的怙恶不悛。
