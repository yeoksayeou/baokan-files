　　Ji Central District Decides to Develop Oil and Cotton Industry to Increase Production of Daily Necessities
　　Industrial Company Formulates This Year's Industrial Policy

　　[Our Newspaper's Dispatch] To vigorously strengthen the construction of the cotton and oil industry and increase the productivity of daily necessities manufacturing plants, the Ji Central District Industrial Company, in order to realize this policy of greatly supplying urban cotton and oil industrial raw materials and rural daily necessities, will establish 100 cotton gins in three regions, including Baoding, this year. It is estimated that 14 million catties of cotton will be ginned, accounting for about 5% of Ji Central District's cotton production. The Baoding cotton and oil factory will also be doubled in size. The match, dyeing and weaving, chemical, and flour factories will strive to exceed last year's output within six months. Iron factories will work to reduce costs, increase profits, become self-reliant, and strengthen themselves; and they will closely connect with rural areas to produce waterwheels, cotton gins, and cast iron pots. The Ji Central District Industrial Company emphasized unified management and democratic administration to further realize enterprise management, improve technology, and practice strict economy to ensure the completion of the above plan. At the same time, the Ji Central District Industrial Company also summarized the experience of industrial construction last year. The summary pointed out that in the past year, the scale, quantity, and quality of products of various state-owned factories have greatly developed. The Jianhua Dyeing and Weaving Factory's daily output in the first half of last year was 20 bolts, and in the second half of the year, it exceeded the planned increase to 95.5 bolts. The output of the Yonghua Match Factory has far exceeded the operating level during the Kuomintang rule. In the past, the average daily output was only 42 carts at most, but now it is 53 carts, and individual carts can reach 63 carts. The average daily output in the past was 14 large boxes, which increased to 16.22 boxes in the first half of last year and 29.57 large boxes in the second half of the year. The chemical factory's daily output of sodium sulfide increased by 200% due to the improvement of nitric acid tanks. In addition, the general output of the leather factory, Lihua Flour Mill, Julong Iron Factory, etc., has increased by about 40% to 60%. While increasing output, the factories have also paid attention to improving the quality of finished products and saving raw materials. The Yonghua Match Factory exceeded the level of the past 30 years in the manufacture of match heads. Due to the addition of a clarification pot, the sodium sulfide's black bottom was reduced from 2.5 inches to only 1.5 inches with a purple bottom. The market has expanded from North China to Shandong. The waste of cast iron pots at the Hongye Iron Factory was reduced from 15% to 12.4%. The number of production personnel in the seven factories was 454 in early March 1948 and increased to 1,028 by the end of the year, an increase of more than double. The main reasons for obtaining the above achievements: First, it was due to the implementation of unified leadership of state-owned industries. At the beginning of last year, the Ji Central District Industrial Company, a unified leading institution, was established, and later the industrial companies at the district level were abolished, unifying the procurement of raw materials and the promotion of finished products. This can solve two fundamental problems: First, each factory can concentrate its efforts to improve tools and improve the quality and quantity of products without having to worry about the lack of raw materials and the sales of products in operation. Second, it is possible to purchase raw materials in a planned way, expand the source of raw material procurement, and stop purchasing when merchants compete for purchases, so as to reduce the sudden increase in raw material costs due to price fluctuations as much as possible. At the same time, opening up more sales channels for products can accelerate the turnover of capital and reduce blindness in production. The second is the implementation of democratic management with responsibility at each level, which has mobilized the enthusiasm of workers. The results achieved in last year's winter production campaign were particularly significant.

　　冀中决发展油棉业提高日用品生产量
  　实业公司拟定今年工业方针
    【本报讯】大力加强棉、油工业建设，提高日用品制造厂的生产力，冀中实业公司为实现这一方针，以大量供给城市棉、油工业原料与农村日用品，今年将在保定等三个地区建立轧花车一百部，预计轧花一千四百万斤，约占冀中棉产量的百分之五。并将保定棉、油厂扩大一倍。火柴、染轧、化学、面粉四厂，争取半年中超过去年一年的产量。铁工厂做到降低成本，增大利润，自力更生，壮大自己；并与农村密切联系，生产水车、轧车并铸锅等。冀中实业公司着重提出经营统一与民主管理，更进一步地实现企业化，提高技术，厉行节约，以保证上述计划的完成。与此同时，冀中实业公司并总结了去年工业建设的经验。总结指明，一年来，各国营工厂的规模与产品数量、质量，都有很大发展。建华染轧厂去年上半年日产量为二十匹，下半年即超过预定计划地增至九十五点五匹。永华火柴厂的产量，已远超过国民党统治时的经营水平，过去最多平均每日只摇四十二车，现为五十三车，个别的可摇到六十三车，日产量过去平均为十四大箱，去年前半年增到十六点二二箱，后半年增到二十九点五七大箱，化学厂由于硝酸罐的改良，硫化碱日产量增加了百分之二百。此外如皮革厂、利华面粉厂、聚隆铁厂等，一般产量均提高百分之四十到百分之六十上下，与提高产量同时，各厂并注意了提高成品质量与节约原料。永华火柴厂在火柴头制造方面，超过了三十余年来的水平，硫化碱的制造，由于添设了澄清锅，过去黑底子二英寸五分，现只有紫底子一英寸五分，市场则从华北扩展到山东。宏业铁厂铸锅废活由百分之十五减至百分之十二点四。七个厂的生产人员一九四八年三月初为四百五十四，年终增至一千零二十八，约增一倍多。获得以上成绩的主要原因：第一是由于实行了国营工业的统一领导，去年初成立了统一领导机构冀中实业公司，后又取消了分区一级的实业公司，统一了原料的采购与成品的推销。这样就可解决两个根本问题：一是各厂可集中力量改进工具，提高产品质量数量，而不必在经营中时时顾虑原料缺乏与产品销路。二是有计划的收买原料，扩大原料采购来源，遇到商贩争购时可以停购，尽可能减免在物价波动时原料成本即被突然提高的情况，同时多方开辟产品销路，可加速资本的周转并减少生产上的盲目性。第二是实行民主管理逐级负责，发动了工人的积极性，在去年冬季生产运动中，获得的成效特别显著。
