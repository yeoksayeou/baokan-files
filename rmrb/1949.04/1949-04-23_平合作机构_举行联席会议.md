　　Ping Cooperative Organizations
  　Hold Joint Meeting
    [This Newspaper's Report] In order to unify working principles and concentrate efforts, the Business Department of the Head Office of the Cooperative Bank and the Beiping Municipal Cooperative Supply and Marketing General Cooperative held a joint cadre meeting yesterday (the 22nd) in the conference room of the Cooperative Bank. Four methods were discussed and decided on how the Cooperative Bank and the cooperative can closely cooperate in the future: (1) In the future, the work plans of the Cooperative Bank's Business Department and the Cooperative Supply and Marketing General Cooperative should be formulated in a unified manner, approved by the highest leading body, and implemented jointly. (2) Before the first method is realized, cadres from the Cooperative Bank, cooperative community branches, and district governments will be dispatched to jointly grasp the situation of restoring production, conducting loans, and establishing cooperatives in their respective regions, formulate unified plans, and report them to their respective leading departments for implementation. (3) In order to make the cooperatives and the Cooperative Bank cooperate closely, cadres from the Cooperative Bank can go to the district cooperatives to handle receipt and payment business when necessary, in order to gradually turn the district cooperatives into lower-level branches of the Cooperative Bank. (4) Due to the special circumstances in the suburbs, it is difficult to form a group of three. The cooperatives, Cooperative Bank, district government, and trade union will hold regular joint meetings to discuss and decide on cooperative loans, agricultural loans, agricultural and sideline loans, and other businesses. In addition, the meeting also decided that because the farmers in Nan Yuan generally lack fertilizer and seeds, the local cooperative should cooperate with the Cooperative Bank to organize members or non-members by village to handle fertilizer and seed loans in kind.

　　平合作机构
  　举行联席会议
    【本报讯】合作银行总行营业部暨北平市合作供销总社为了统一工作方针，集中使用力量，于昨日（二十二日）在合作银行会议室举行干部联席会议。对今后合作银行与合作社如何密切配合，商讨出四项办法：（一）今后合作银行营业部与合作供销总社之工作计划应统一订定，由最高领导机关批准，共同贯彻执行。（二）在第一项办法未实现前，由合作银行、合作社区分社及区政府三方面派遣干部，共同掌握各该地区恢复生产、进行贷款、建立合作社等情况，统一制定计划，分别报告各该领导部门执行。（三）为了使合作社与合作银行密切配合，合作银行方面干部必要时可到区合作社办理收付款业务，以期逐步把区合作社变成合作银行下层分支机构。（四）郊区情况特殊，成立三人小组困难，合作社、合作银行，区政府及工会举行定期联席会，商讨并决定合作贷款，农贷，农副业贷款等业务。此外，会上并决定：由于南苑农民普遍缺乏肥料、种籽。即由该地合作社配合合作银行，以村为单位，组织社员或非社员办理肥料、种籽贷实。
