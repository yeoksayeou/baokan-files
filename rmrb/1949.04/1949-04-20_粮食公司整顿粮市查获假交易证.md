　　Grain Company Rectifies Grain Market
  　Confiscates Fake Transaction Certificates
    [Our Newspaper] The Ping City Grain Company confiscated two forged transaction certificate stamps at the Four-Faced Clock Grain Market on the 17th. They were immediately confiscated, and clues were pursued. On the 18th, the Grain Company assisted the Industry and Commerce Bureau in conducting a general inspection and discovered that more than 500 people had mixed into the market wearing fake badges (many threw away the fake badges during the inspection, and some people ran away). The original plates of Zhi Xing Hou Badge Bureau, Tian Hua Badge Shop, Wen Hua Badge Bureau, and Yu Hua Badge Bureau have now been seized, and the shop owners have confessed. According to Han Ruiliang, the mastermind behind the manufacture of the fake certificates, he made more than 70 pieces, of which 15 have been sold, each priced at 100 yuan. This kind of behavior of deceiving the People's Government and disrupting the market should be taken seriously. The Industry and Commerce Bureau is currently studying how to deal with it. (Lin Xi)
