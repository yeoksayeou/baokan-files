From New Year Pictures to Little Picture Books
　　——Thoughts After Visiting the New Year Picture Exhibition
　　Wu Lao
　　"Under the leadership of the Communist Party, there really is a way to transform the feudal and superstitious things that have been anesthetizing the common people for thousands of years into new things. This is truly a new principle and a new thing..." As I walked to the entrance of the venue, I heard the audience coming out saying this. This is very true. Indeed, the places where old New Year pictures are printed, such as Yangliuqing and Wuqiang, print a large number every year. The farmers here engage in this as a side business after autumn. Merchants who come to buy old New Year pictures fill the hotels, and large and small carts transport them to various places. Today, the peasant masses in Wuqiang, Xinji, and various areas of southern Hebei, under the leadership of the Communist Party, have improved their political awareness and cultural level. They have adopted an attitude of neither belittling nor accommodating the old New Year pictures with feudal toxins. In recent years, art workers have gone deep into the masses and transformed the old New Year pictures. The new New Year pictures have taken root among the masses. This form is already familiar and supported by the farmers because it reflects the new life and new demands of the masses.
　　Although New Year pictures are produced in many places in the Liberated Areas and the quantity is considerable, the sales situation is always in short supply. Folk artists who have been making old New Year pictures for a long time have also seen the development prospects of new New Year pictures. Many places have spontaneously organized to produce New Year pictures with new content or reprint new New Year pictures, which has accelerated the decline of old New Year pictures. This kind of group organization is growing everywhere in the Liberated Areas and is very successful.
　　Most of the audience at the exhibition lingered in front of several sets of comic strip stories, which seemed particularly crowded because comic strips have characters and stories, and one can see relatively rich content from the pictures. Single pictures, because of their simple images, cannot express more content, and the masses cannot meet their needs. Because they want to know more about real things and more concrete stories, and learn from them. Especially after the children have finished watching, they ask to buy comic books. They used to be fascinated by the old little picture books. Today, when they see the new comic books from the Liberated Areas, they also want to understand the new and wonderful lives of the people's struggles in the Liberated Areas and like heroic model stories with a beginning and an end. But we have too few works in this area. They are still watching those monster and martial arts little picture books in the streets and alleys in groups. These poisonous things need to be valued by literary and art workers. If we can use the form of comic strips to create more comic strips with new content to replace these little picture books and guide children's thinking to the right path, then it is urgent to more widely transform folk artists to engage in this work. It can be asserted that in a very short time, new comic strips will replace the old little picture books just like new New Year pictures. To complete this work, more art workers and literary workers must participate in cultivation, so that it will be as quickly liked by the masses in the countryside as New Year pictures are.

　　由新年画说到小人书
    ——参观年画展后的感想
    吴劳
    “在共产党领导下的事情，确实有办法，能将几千年来封建迷信麻醉老百姓的玩意，也改造成新的东西了，这真是新的道理新的事情……”当我走到会场门口时，听见出来的观众边走边说。这话说得很对，的确旧年画印刷的地方，在杨柳青、武强等地，每年印刷的数量是很大的，这里的农民一到秋后就当副业经营，来购买旧年画的客商住满旅店，大车小车运往各地，而今天，武强、辛集、以及冀南各地区由于在共产党领导下的农民群众，其政治觉悟文化程度的提高，对于有封建毒素的旧年画，采取了既不卑弃亦不迁就的态度，几年来美术工作者深入群众，改造了旧的年画，新的年画已经在群众中生了根，这形式已为农民所熟悉与拥戴，因它反映了群众新的生活和新的要求。
    新年画在解放区虽有很多的地方制作，数量是可观的，但销售的情况都是供不应求。长期作旧年画的民间艺人也看到新年画的发展前途，很多地方自发的组织起来制作新内容的年画或翻印新年画，这就更使旧年画加速度的没落，这种团体的组织在解放区到处在增长中，是很有成绩的。
    展览的这些作品，观众大都逗留在几套连环故事画的前面，显得格外的拥挤，因为连环画，有人物，有故事，能从画面上看到比较丰富的内容。对于单幅画由于画面简单，不能表现更多的内容，群众不能满足要求。因为他们想知道更多现实的事情，和更多具体的故事，并从中得到教育。尤其儿童们看完后，提出要买连环图画，他们对过去的小人书是看得入迷的，今天看见解放区新的连环图画，也想了解解放区新奇的人民斗争的生活，喜欢有头有尾的英雄模范故事。但我们这方面的作品是太少了，他们还是在大街小巷成群的观看那些神怪武侠的小人书，这些有毒素的东西，是有待于文艺、美术工作者来重视的，如果能用连环画这一形式，创造更多新内容的连环画，来代替这些小人书，把儿童的思想引导到正路。那样就急需更广泛的改造民间艺人也来从事这一工作，可以断言，在很短时间之内，新的连环画亦象新的年画一样代替了旧的小人书。要完成这一工作，必须有更多的美术工作者、文艺工作者的参加栽培，使它象新年画很快地象在农村一样地得到群众的喜爱。
