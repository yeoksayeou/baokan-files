Worker's Work in Zhangjiakou

In the early days of Zhangjiakou's liberation, the leading cadres' understanding of relying on the working class to build the city was not clear. They lacked sufficient understanding of the characteristics of Zhangjiakou, which had been liberated in the past, had a certain work foundation, and had a considerable degree of awareness among the workers. In the takeover work, they did not or rarely involve workers, and did not quickly delve into the workers. The actual difficulties of the workers were not resolved in a timely manner, especially the extremely unreasonable wages during the enemy occupation, which were not adjusted in a timely manner, and the "original position, original salary" was mechanically implemented. Therefore, some workers developed doubts and dissatisfaction with the Party's policies. After the above deviations were reviewed, they were quickly corrected. In the past two months, the worker's work has achieved many results.

First, the preparatory committees of trade unions were established in twenty public enterprise units, and the number of members absorbed accounted for about 80% of all employees. The Telecommunications Administration, Water Company, Soy Sauce Factory, and First Flour Mill are now beginning to establish formal trade unions. Forty-seven industry and street trade unions and three groups have been established in the city, with a total of 3,358 members. The organization is currently under review. Secondly, in order to solve the livelihood problems of unemployed workers, the People's Government has distributed worn-out cotton clothes, clothing pieces, money, cigarettes, etc., totaling more than 870,000 yuan in Renminbi, and lent them to unemployed workers and the poor to organize cooperative production. A total of eleven production cooperatives and forty-one small production groups have been organized in the city, with a total of 1,023 members, of which workers account for 70%. Some have achieved results in production. For example, the carpentry and tile cooperative with more than 20 people contracted two projects, which can earn more than 390,000 yuan in Renminbi. Third, the illegal acts of certain private enterprises and shops dismissing workers without reason were properly handled, and attention was paid to the welfare of workers. For example, employers dismissed workers and shop assistants without reason, even canceling the practice of workers eating fine grains during festivals, or restricting workers from participating in political activities, or pretending to be workers to participate, or sending foremen to participate in workers' meetings. These illegal acts were resolved satisfactorily under the leadership of the trade union and the workers' and shop assistants' reasonable struggle. In addition, under the principle of "both labor and capital benefit, and the economy prospers," workers' wages were appropriately increased through labor-capital consultation, and workers were also persuaded not to make excessive demands, and the wages of workers in public enterprises were appropriately adjusted. Fourth, public enterprise employees were organized to study. Each preparatory committee of the trade union of public enterprises has organized a study committee to specifically lead the study, and generally can persist in studying for two hours. The Sixth District also held two sessions of spare-time training classes for 59 workers, which improved the workers' class consciousness. Fifth, workers were organized and mobilized to participate in various construction projects. The working class played a backbone and vanguard role in destroying the puppet Baojia organizations, and actively participated in street administration. Workers account for 31% of the 160 street chiefs. Workers also played a significant role in the work of eliminating Kuomintang secret agents. For example, Fan Shushi, the deputy director of the puppet Youth Training Brigade, automatically took him to the Public Security Bureau when rickshaw driver Liu Zhanyi took him from Beiping back to Zhangjiakou.

However, there are still many problems in the current worker's work, such as the unsoundness of the organizational structure, some cadres are not at ease with the labor movement work, there are few cadres in the trade unions of various public enterprises, their ability is weak, and the leadership is not unified, etc.

In addition, although the wage issue for workers has been adjusted, the unreasonable phenomenon that a small number of people relied on connections to earn high wages during the time of the Kuomintang bandit gang has not been completely corrected. There are still some bureaucratic work styles and tailism tendencies in the leadership of some factories. For example, the Water Company increased the wages of technicians without going through the masses of workers and listening to the feedback from the masses of workers, which affected the fluctuations in the workers' emotions. These all need to be overcome urgently. (Xing, Lü Guangming)

　　张家口的工人工作
    张市解放初期，由于领导干部依靠工人阶级建设城市的思想不明确，对张市过去曾被解放，有一定工作基础，工人有相当觉悟的特点认识不足，在接管工作上，没有或很少吸收工人参加，没有很快深入到工人中去，对工人实际困难没及时解决，特别是对敌占期间极不合理的工资，没及时加以调整，机械地执行“原职原薪”，因此，使得一些工人对党的政策，发生了怀疑和不满。以上偏向经检讨后，迅速获得纠正，两月来，工人工作已收到不少成绩。
    首先建立了二十个公营企业单位的职工筹委会，吸收会员约占全体职工的百分之八十。电信管理局、自来水公司、酱油厂、第一面粉厂，现正开始建立正式职工会。全市已建立起各行业街道工会四十七个、小组三个，共有会员三千三百五十八名。现正进行审查组织中。其次，为了解决失业工人生活问题，人民政府曾发放破旧棉衣、衣片、款、纸烟等共折人民币八十七万余元，贷与失业工人及贫民，组织了合作生产。全市共组织了生产合作社十一个，小型生产组四十一个，共有社员一千零二十三名，其中工人占百分之七十。有的在生产上已获成绩。如木瓦合作社二十多人，包了两宗工程，即可赚人民币三十九万余元。第三，适当处理了某些私营企业、商店无故开除工人的非法行为，注意了工人的福利。如资方无故开除工人、店员，甚至取消工人过节吃细粮等惯例，或限制工人参加政治活动，或冒充工人去参加，或派工头去参加工人会议，这些违法行为、在工会的领导和工人、店员的说理斗争下，都获得圆满解决。另外，在“劳资两利，繁荣经济”的方针下，经劳资协商，适当地提高了工人的工资，同时也说服了工人不提过高要求，并适当地调整了公营企业工人的工资。第四，组织公营企业职工进行了学习。各公营企业职工筹委会都组织了学习委员会，专门领导学习，一般都能坚持两小时学习。六区并举办了两期五十九名工人的业余训练班，提高了工人的阶级觉悟。第五，组织与发动工人参加了各种建设。在摧毁伪保甲组织时，工人阶级起了骨干与先锋作用，并积极参加了街政权。在一百六十名街长中，工人占百分之三十一。在肃清国民党特务工作时，工人也起了很大作用。如伪青训大队副主任范树仕由北平回张市时，洋车工人刘占义就自动把他拉到了公安局。
    但目前工人工作还存在着不少问题，如组织机构不健全，有些干部不安心于工运工作，各公营企业职工会干部少，能力弱，领导也不统一等。
    别外，工人工资问题，虽进行了调整，但国民党匪帮在时，少数靠门子赚大工钱的不合理现象仍未完全纠正。某些工厂的领导上尚存在着官僚主义作风和尾巴主义倾向。如自来水公司给技师增工资，不通过工人群众，不听取工人群众的反映，致影响到工人情绪的波动，这些都急待克服。　　（兴、吕光明）
