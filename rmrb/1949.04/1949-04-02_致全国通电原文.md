To the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese People's Liberation Army, all democratic parties, all people's organizations, and all compatriots throughout the nation:

　　The First National Women's Congress of China opened in Beiping on March 24th. This congress is the culmination of decades of struggle by revolutionary women across the country. The struggle for women's liberation is not isolated; the great victory of the women's movement is part of the great victory of the national people's democratic revolution. As we gather here today, we respectfully salute the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese People's Liberation Army, all democratic parties, all people's organizations, and the revolutionary people of China.

　　Chinese women have long suffered from the deep oppression of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism. In a society with inequality between men and women, women suffer even more than men. Now the rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism has been overthrown in the liberated areas of China, and the final victory of the Chinese people's democratic revolution is approaching. This victory is the solid foundation for the liberation of Chinese women. In order to realize this victory, the First National Women's Congress of China has decided to lead women across the country, together with the people of the whole country, to resolutely support the eight peace terms put forward by Chairman Mao Zedong of the Chinese Communist Party, and to resolutely oppose any false peace conspiracies that violate these eight terms.

　　The First National Women's Congress of China believes that in the liberated areas of China, laboring women in rural areas where land reform has been completed, and female workers in enterprises operated by the people's democratic government, are now in the position of masters of their own destiny. Therefore, their primary task is to strive to develop production with the attitude of masters, in order to accelerate the victory of the people's liberation struggle: to improve the overall national economic situation, and thereby gradually improve their own material lives and enhance their social status. In rural areas where land reform has not been completed or carried out, and in privately-run enterprises, laboring women should actively participate in land reform work and work to protect labor rights, and ensure that their struggles are in line with the interests of the overall social production development. All intellectual women in the liberated areas should closely integrate with the broad masses of laboring women, so as to serve the people's liberation struggle and the people's democratic construction cause together with them. All women in the liberated areas must strive to learn politics and culture, and strive to raise their revolutionary consciousness and understand the historical laws of women's liberation and the liberation of laborers. In the Kuomintang-controlled areas, all democratic women should pay attention to preparing their own strength to cooperate with the progress of the people's liberation struggle.

　　The First National Women's Congress of China has decided to establish the All-China Democratic Women's Federation as the leading organ of the national women's movement in the future. We believe that in the high tide of the Chinese revolution, the Chinese democratic women, who have realized national unity, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and with the assistance of all democratic forces in the country, will surely be able to complete our historical mission more smoothly in the future!

　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　The First National Women's Congress of China

　　致全国通电原文
    中国共产党、中国人民解放军、全国各民主党派、各人民团体和全国同胞：
    中国妇女第一次全国代表大会于三月二十四日在北平开幕。这个大会，是我们全国革命妇女数十年奋斗的结晶。妇女解放的斗争不是孤立的，妇女运动的伟大胜利，是全国人民民主革命运动伟大胜利的一部分。当我们今天欢聚一堂的时候，我们谨向中国共产党、中国人民解放军、各民主党派、各人民团体和中国革命人民表示敬意。
    中国妇女长期遭受帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的深重压迫，在男女不平等的社会中，妇女们受的痛苦比男子更甚。现在帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的统治在中国解放区已经被推翻了，中国人民民主革命在全国的最后胜利也已经逼近了，这个胜利是中国妇女解放的巩固基础。为了实现这个胜利，中国妇女第一次全国代表大会，决定领导全国妇女，和全国人民在一起，坚决拥护中国共产党毛泽东主席所提出的八项和平条件，坚决反对任何违背这八项条件的假和平阴谋。
    中国妇女第一次全国代表大会认为：在中国解放区，在已经完成了土地改革的农村中的劳动妇女，和人民民主政府所经营的企业中的女工，现时已经处于主人翁的地位，因此她们的首要任务，就是以主人翁的态度努力发展生产，以便加速人民解放斗争的胜利：改善整个国民经济的状况，从而逐步改善自己的物质生活，提高自己的社会地位。在没有完成或没有进行土地改革的农村中，在私人经营的企业中，劳动妇女应当积极参加土地改革的工作和保障劳动权利的工作，并使自己的斗争，符合于整个社会生产发展的利益。解放区的一切知识妇女，应当与广大劳动妇女密切结合，以便与她们共同为人民解放斗争和人民民主建设事业服务。所有解放区的妇女群众，都必须努力学习政治和文化，努力提高自己的革命觉悟，了解妇女解放和劳动者解放的历史规律。在国民党统治区，一切民主妇女应当注意准备自己的力量，配合人民解放斗争的进展。
    中国妇女第一次全国代表大会决定成立中华全国民主妇女联合会，作为今后全国妇女运动的领导机关，我们相信：在中国革命高涨中，实现了全国大团结的中国民主妇女，在中国共产党的领导之下，在全国一切民主力量的协助之下，今后一定能更顺利地完成我们的历史任务！
