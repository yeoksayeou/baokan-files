(Taiyue Electricity) Li Wusheng, a resident of Nanguan in Changzi County, responded to the government's call to breed livestock. In February, he held a family meeting and borrowed five shi of rice from the bank, along with a loan of 110,000 yuan (RMB), to buy two male donkeys. Together with the one he already owned, he had a total of three. He and his brother, Li Mingzhi, divided the work. His brother stayed home to wait for the masses to bring their female animals for mating, while he took the breeding livestock to the countryside to attend temple fairs, which was very popular with the masses. From February 17th to March 11th, he mated a total of 56 donkeys and 14 horses, earning 22 shi and 4 dou of millet. At least half of those mated are expected to produce offspring. Furthermore, the livestock trading team of Wang Dongzhi in Baodian County transported 75 livestock from last winter to February this year in four trips. This time, to facilitate the purchase of female animals by the masses, they borrowed 2,000 yuan from the bank in March and combined it with 1,500 yuan of private funds from the masses to purchase 21 livestock from livestock-producing areas, including 14 female donkeys.
