　　Reply Regarding the Apportionment of Electricity Bills for Mixed Use by Residents of Beiping

　　Messrs. Wang Hongji and Zhang Jingming: Regarding the issues of residents living in the same courtyard and apportioning electricity bills for mixed use, we have requested Hebei Electric Power Company to explain as follows:

　　① Naturally, it would be ideal for each household to have its own meter for electricity consumption, making electricity bill calculation simpler. However, the company currently has a limited number of meters, and due to difficult economic conditions, replenishment is not easy. Furthermore, electricity meters cannot be manufactured domestically and must be purchased from abroad. Therefore, adding meters is not feasible at the moment due to both subjective and objective conditions. Thus, one meter per household is currently difficult to achieve.

　　② We hope that users and users, and users and the company, can understand each other, cooperate with each other, and that a relatively reasonable method of electricity bill apportionment can be achieved. As for electricity consumption, before the company's power supply increases, please adhere to the principle of "saving consumption and increasing production," and everyone should save electricity together to maintain public use and reduce the burden of electricity bills.

　　③ If a friend has an unused meter, if you obtain their consent, both parties can bring the various deposit receipts and the electricity bill receipts for the most recent three months to the Business Section of our branch (No. 26 Shuncheng Street, Qianmen Inner) to handle the meter transfer and account transfer procedures.

  　关于北平市民混合用电分摊电费的答复
    王洪及、张敬铭两先生：关于市民等同住一院，混合用电分摊电费诸问题，我们已请冀北电力公司解释如下：
    ①用户用电当然以每户一表最为理想，计算电费更属简易，然而公司目前存表不多，加以经济情形困难，补充不易，而电表一项，国内无法制造，必须向国外购买，无论在主观客观条件上添置问题，一时还不能解决，因此每户一表，目前尚难办到。
    ②用户与用户间，用户与公司间，希望互相体谅，彼此合作，电费分摊，总可得到一个较为合理的办法。至于耗电问题，在公司最近供电量尚未增加之前，务请本着“节约消费增加生产”的原则，大家一同节省电流，以维公用，并可减轻电费负担。
    ③友人有不用的表，如果征得他的同意，双方可持各项保证金收据及最近三个月的电费收据，到本分公司业务科（前门内顺城街二十六号）办理移表与过户手续。
