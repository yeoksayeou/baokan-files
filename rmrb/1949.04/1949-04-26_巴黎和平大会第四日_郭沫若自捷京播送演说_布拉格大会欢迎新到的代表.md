Then, Chairman Szaczińska announced to the conference the arrival of the delegation from the Mongolian People's Republic to the World Congress of Supporters of Peace, and the whole audience applauded to welcome them. The delegation of the working people of Paris congratulated the conference one by one on the 23rd meeting and announced their determination to fight for peace.

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 25th: Prague dispatch: At the meeting on the third day (23rd) of the Prague Peace Congress, representatives from various countries warmly welcomed the newly arrived representatives, including Dabosé, Vice-President of the Federal Assembly of France and Secretary-General of the African Democratic Union of "French Equatorial Africa", Martialca, representative of the US delegation and Vice-Chairman of the American Slav Congress, Griffini, representative of the Italian delegation, and Simonov, a famous Soviet writer. Dabosé, on behalf of the Paris Peace Congress, sent warm greetings to all the representatives attending the Prague Peace Congress.

At the third day of the conference, Xidanbaor, a representative of the Mongolian People's Republic, said that the people of the Mongolian People's Republic declared that they did not want war. The Pacific Pact will cause the reconstruction of Japanese military aggression forces. Our unremitting struggle is the best way to stop the danger of war. Professor Kokalis, a representative of Democratic Greece, said that the Greek people will continue their heroic struggle against imperialism and fascism until final victory. After the German trade union leader Bernhard Goering and Austrian parliamentarian Fischer spoke successively, Soviet representative Fedorov spoke, wishing all representatives and all peace advocates further victories in the struggle to consolidate universal peace. He said that the Soviet people will never forget the great contributions made by the best people of European countries in the cause of defeating the fascist bandits. He also said: When the war was still going on, the Soviet people were already restoring the destroyed cities and villages and formulating huge peaceful construction plans. The residents of the Soviet cities that had been bombed by the enemy believed that the residents of London, Birmingham, Paris, Warsaw and Budapest still remembered the howling of fascist bombs, and therefore did not want war either. The defenders of Moscow will not allow a new war to destroy everything created by the genius of the great people.

On the same day, many delegations from various factories and plants in Czechoslovakia paid tribute to the conference.
