[Tianjin Electric Dispatch] The Tianjin Municipal Tax Bureau has decided to begin collecting business tax from businesses within the coming days and has resolved to adopt a method of self-reporting and public consultation. Businesses will self-report their income, which will then be subject to democratic public discussion. Collection will proceed after the public discussion, review, and approval, in order to ensure a fair and reasonable burden. If businesses disagree with the results of the public discussion, they may apply for reconsideration within three days. Under Kuomintang rule, the collection of business tax in this city initially used an accounting-based method, which was extremely burdensome for merchants. Although a so-called "simplified tax collection method" was later adopted, it still had major drawbacks. This method used a tax amount determined by accounting verification in one period as a standard, and then increased it proportionally according to the rate of price increases during the collection period. However, because business conditions in industry and commerce change from time to time, some merchants suffered great losses.

　　天津税务局开征座商税
    【天津电】天津市税务局定日内开征座商营业税，并决定采用自报公议办法。由商户自行申报，然后再行民主公议，经过公议审定批准后，再行征收，以求负担公平合理。公议结果，如商户有不同意见，仍可在三天内再行申请。按国民党统治时，本市座商营业税的征收，最初采用查帐计税办法，对商民苛扰太甚，以后虽改用所谓“简化稽征办法”，仍有极大流弊。因该项办法是用一个时期查帐核定的税额作标准，征收时期，按物价上升情形比例增加，但工商业营业情况不时发生变化，于是有的商户，就吃了大亏。
