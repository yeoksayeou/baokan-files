Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 1st: The economic collapse in the Kuomintang-controlled areas has reached new heights. The price of rice in Shanghai rose to over 70,000 fake Gold Yuan notes per shi (a unit of dry measure) on the 23rd, about five times higher than when the "Financial Reform Program" was announced a month ago, and more than 3,330 times higher than on August 19th of last year when the "currency reform" occurred. The fake Gold Yuan has depreciated to such an extent that the face value of a 100-yuan note is not even worth the cost of printing. According to an Associated Press dispatch on the 27th, citing estimates from the printing department of the Shanghai Da Mei Evening News, it costs 200,000 yuan to print 1,000 "Gold Yuan" notes with a face value of 100 yuan, resulting in a net loss of 100,000 yuan. However, the Kuomintang reactionary government has no choice but to rely on printing presses to survive, so it resorts to expanding the face value as a desperate measure. Less than a month after the introduction of 500-yuan and 1,000-yuan banknotes, the newly appointed pseudo-Minister of Finance, Liu Gongyun, is preparing to issue banknotes with face values of 5,000, 10,000, 50,000, and 100,000 yuan. The phenomenon of people refusing to use the fake Gold Yuan has become even more common. In markets in Shanghai, Guilin, and other places, 100-yuan, 50-yuan, and 20-yuan notes are already being rejected. Many merchants in Hankou are refusing to accept "Gold Yuan" notes by closing their shops and refusing to sell goods. In the vicinity of Changsha, barter is commonly practiced. Families celebrating weddings hang a steelyard at their door. Guests bring gifts of rice, which is weighed and recorded, and they are given a small amount of rice as a return gift. In areas close to the liberated areas, people are competing to use and preserve the currency of the liberated areas. The Kuomintang local reactionary governments are each devising their own tools to plunder the people's wealth. The provincial governments of Sichuan, Xikang, Yunnan, Guizhou, Jiangxi, Xinjiang, and other provinces are preparing to issue local fake currencies. Many counties in Hunan have already printed and are using different county currencies and town currencies. The main reason for the soaring prices and the rapid depreciation of currency, as in the past, is the continued and sharp expansion of the reactionary government's counter-revolutionary military and administrative expenses. According to Liu Gongyun, the former president of the pseudo-Central Bank, and Lin Chongyong, the director of the business bureau, the original budget for Nanjing's treasury expenditure in February was 20.7 billion, but the actual expenditure was more than 40 billion. In March, the expenditure in 20 days was 159.4 billion, more than three times the total expenditure in February. The actual figure is certainly even higher than this. Moreover, Kuomintang reactionary bureaucrats are using their privileges to speculate and manipulate with large amounts of military and administrative expenses, which further accelerates the rise in prices. Tang Honglie, a pseudo-supervisory committee member, admitted: "Military and administrative organs are everywhere in Shanghai. After receiving large amounts of funds, entire boxes of unused banknotes are transferred to the market and turned into speculative capital." Because the value of the currency is falling faster than inflation, and as a result of the speculation and manipulation of bureaucratic capital, a shortage of funds has been created. In early March, cities such as Chongqing, Chengdu, Shanghai, Kunming, and Guilin were engulfed in a frenzy of cash shortages, which is still rampant. The bureaucratic capital banks are taking the opportunity to limit the amount of deposits that people can withdraw each day to 5,000 to 10,000 yuan, which is not even enough to buy a meal. Factories in Shanghai are using checks to pay wages. Workers and general public servants have to discount their checks by as much as 50% in order to exchange them for cash. The living standards of the working people have been reduced by half.

　　国民党反动政府靠印刷机过日子
  　经济崩溃达到新高度
    人民拒用伪“金圆券”现象更为普遍
    【新华社北平一日电】国民党统治区的经济崩溃达到了新的高度。上海米价二十三日涨到每市石伪金圆券七万元以上，约为一个月前宣布“财政金融改革案”时的五倍，去年八月十九日“币制改革”时的三千三百三十多倍。伪金圆券贬值到这种程度，以致百元票的身价已顶不上印刷费成本。据美联社二十七日电引上海大美晚报承印部的估计，印刷一百元票面的“金圆券”一千张，就需要成本二十万元，净亏本十万元。但国民党反动政府不能不靠印刷机过日子，于是便以扩大票面饮鸩止渴。五百元、一千元大钞出笼不到一月，新任伪财政部长刘攻芸又在准备发行五千、一万、五万和十万元票面的大钞。人民拒用伪金圆券现象已更为普遍，上海、桂林等地市面上已经拒用一百元、五十元及二十元券，汉口很多商人以关门不卖货拒用“金圆券”。长沙附近普遍实行物物交换，做喜事人家门口挂一杆秤，来客送礼的米，秤过入帐，就回他一两筒米的力钱。接近解放区的地方，则争着使用和保存解放区钞票。国民党各地方反动政府各自另定搜括人民财富的工具。四川、西康、云南、贵州、江西、新疆等省府，正准备发行地方伪币。湖南很多县份已在印发和使用着各县不同的县币、市镇币。物价狂涨币值急跌的主要原因，和过去一样，是由于反动政府反革命军政费开支的继续猛烈扩大。据前伪中央银行总裁刘攻芸和业务局长林崇镛称：南京国库开支二月份原预算是二百零七亿，实际支出四百多亿，三月份二十天内就开支了一千五百九十四亿，较二月份全月增加了三倍多。实际当然还不止此数。而国民党反动官僚利用特权以大量军政费进行投机操纵，更加速了物价的上涨速度。伪监察委员唐鸿烈承认：“上海军政机关林立，大批款项领到后，每有整箱未动之银票转入市场，变为投机资本”。因为币值跌落得比通货膨胀更快和官僚资本投机操纵的结果，又造成头寸短缺的现象。三月上旬，重庆、成都、上海、昆明、桂林等城市，都接着卷起了现钞荒的狂潮，现在仍在泛滥不止。各官僚资本银行乘机限制人民每日只能提出存款五千到一万元，连买一顿饭都不够。上海的工厂乃用支票来开工资，工人及一般公教人员要把支票兑成现款，又必须贴水到五成之高。劳动人民的生活又被降低了二分之一。
