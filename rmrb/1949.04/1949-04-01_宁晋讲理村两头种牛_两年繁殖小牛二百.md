Ningjin's Jiangli Village's Two Breeding Bulls
Two Hundred Calves Bred in Two Years

[Hebei Central News] Li Xiangchen and two other families in Jiangli Village, Ningjin Third District, have been raising breeding bulls and have bred 210 calves in the past two years. Of these, 145 were bred in the village, and another 65 were bred for Leijiazhuang and more than ten other villages. Hou Yushen and three other households in the village each had one cow that bred three calves. They sold one or two of them, increasing their income. Li Xiangchen and the other two families bought a yellow breeding bull without teeth in January of the 36th year of the Republic of China (1947). Five days after the purchase, they began mating livestock, charging one dou and two sheng of black beans per mating. Seeing that raising breeding bulls was very profitable, they bought another yellow calf breeding bull on the 20th day of the tenth lunar month last year. They began mating cows on the 26th of the same month and have already mated 35 cows. As you walk into Jiangli Village, you can see a cow with a calf everywhere.

[Another Dispatch] The Beikouli Flour Mill Cooperative in Ningjin bought a light yellow toothless breeding bull on the 23rd day of the eleventh lunar month of last year. The bull began mating on the third day after the purchase. In the past three months, it has successfully mated 32 cows, including 22 in the village and 10 from other villages.

　　宁晋讲理村两头种牛
    两年繁殖小牛二百
    【冀中讯】宁晋三区讲理村李祥琛等三家，畜养种牛，两年来繁殖小牛二百一十头。计本村一百四十五头，另给雷家庄等十余村繁殖六十五头。本村侯玉深等四户，都是一个母牛繁殖了三个小牛，他们或则卖出一头，或则卖出二头，增加了收入。李祥琛等三家系于民国三十六年一月买的一头没牙的黄色种牛，买后五天即配牲口，每配一头，收资一市斗二升黑豆。他们因见养种牛很赚钱，又于去年阴历十月二十日买得一头黄色的牛犊子种牛，同月二十六日即配牛，现已配三十五头。你只要走进讲理村，到处可以看到一个母牛带着一个小牛。
    【又讯】宁晋北口里粉坊合作社于去年古历十一月二十三日买了一头淡黄色的没牙的种牛，买后第三天即配牛，三个月来，配准了三十二个，计本村二十二个，外村十个。
