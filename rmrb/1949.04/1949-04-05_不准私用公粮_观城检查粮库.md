[Ji Lu Yu Electric Dispatch] Guancheng County Warehouse recently inspected the grain storage conditions in various village warehouses. It is understood that among the warehouses in fifty-two villages in the five districts of the county, twelve villages were found to have phenomena such as borrowing and using public grain for private purposes and empty storage (i.e., only storage receipts but no actual grain). In the Dali Village warehouse in the Third District, empty storage and borrowing amounted to 1,740 jin of soybeans, 9,875 jin of corn, and 1,942 jin of wheat. The reasons for these problems are as follows: (1) Insufficient inspection. For example, there was no good inspection after the autumn tax collection, and there was no precise and detailed understanding after the grain was stored in the village warehouse. Sometimes, when empty storage and borrowing were discovered, strict criticism was not given seriously. Sometimes, when problems were heard about in the village warehouse, writing letters was often used instead of personal inspection. (2) No action was taken against those who had used public grain for private purposes, resulting in indulgence of repeated offenses. (3) The person in charge of the village warehouse was embarrassed to insist on the system. Based on the above inspection, the following solutions are proposed: (1) Convene a meeting of sub-warehouse accountants to report on the grain situation and existing problems in each warehouse. Cadres should be specifically assigned to conduct practical inspections and educate the masses in the villages owing public grain to immediately return the public grain for military needs. (2) Appropriate punishment should be given to those who have privately used public grain in the past and have not returned it. (3) Order district and village warehouses to strictly enforce the system, prohibiting empty storage and borrowing. Those who have not returned the grain must return it within a limited time, otherwise, they will be treated as privately using public grain. The county warehouse is currently carrying out the consolidation of warehouses to deal with outstanding cases.

　　不准私用公粮　观城检查粮库
    【冀鲁豫电】观城县仓库近检查各村仓库粮食保管状况。据了解，全县五个区五十二个村仓库中，有十二个村内发现借支动用及空存（即仅有存条而无现粮）等现象。三区大吕村仓库，空存借支计有＠豆一千七百四十斤，玉米九千八百七十五斤，麦一千九百四十二斤。所以发生毛病有以下原因：（一）检查不够。如秋征后没有很好的检查过，存到村库之后，也没有作精密细致的了解。有时了解到空存借支，也没有认真给以严格批评，有时听到村库有问题，常是以写信代替亲身检查。（二）对已动用公粮的人未加处理，致放纵一犯再犯。（三）村仓库负责人碍于情面，不能坚持制度。根据以上检查，提出解决办法：（一）召开分库会计会议，汇报各库粮食情况和现存问题。干部具体分工切实检查，并向欠公粮村庄的群众进行教育，使他们马上交还公粮，以供军需。（二）对过去私自动用公粮未归还者给以适当处分。（三）下令区村库严格制度，不准空存借支，对未归还者，限期归还，否则以私动公粮论处。该县仓库刻正进行并仓处理悬案中。
