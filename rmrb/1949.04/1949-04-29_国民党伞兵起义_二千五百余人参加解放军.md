Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 28th: Nationalist Air Force Headquarters' entire 3rd Paratrooper Regiment and parts of the Paratrooper Headquarters and the 1st and 2nd Regiments, totaling over two thousand five hundred men, under the leadership of Colonel Liu Nongjun, commander of the 3rd Regiment, Lieutenant Colonel Jiang Jian, deputy commander, and Lieutenant Colonel Li Guitian, deputy regiment commander, have revolted and joined the People's Liberation Army. The uprising troops were under orders from the puppet Ministry of National Defense to go to Fujian to serve as Chiang Kai-shek's garrison troops. On April 13th, they left Shanghai aboard the China Merchants Bureau's Zhongzi No. 102 tank landing craft (3,000 tons displacement), and while en route to Fuzhou, turned north and safely arrived in a certain liberated area on the 15th, where they were warmly welcomed by the local People's Liberation Army, the People's Government, and the local people.

　　Beijing Xinhua Broadcasting Station, Beijing, April 28th news: After arriving in the liberated area, all officers and soldiers of the uprising Nationalist Army's 3rd Paratrooper Regiment sent a telegram to Chairman Mao of the CPC Central Committee and Commander-in-Chief Zhu of the Chinese People's Liberation Army to pay their respects. The telegram reads as follows:

　　Chairman Mao of the CPC Central Committee, Commander-in-Chief Zhu: Our country and people are suffering from the oppression of the Kuomintang's Four Big Families and are displaced and wandering. We have also seen the people in dire straits and deeply feel distressed. In order to end the anti-people's brutal war as soon as possible and for permanent peace to arrive soon, just as we were being transferred to Fuzhou, all officers and soldiers believed that this was a great opportunity for us to break away from the corrupt clique's rule. With boiling enthusiasm, we resolutely revolted and safely entered the liberated area on April 15th. From now on, we are willing to dedicate the intelligence of all our officers and soldiers, under the leadership of the People's Government, to establish a people's paratrooper force, a new force for national defense, and build a new China that is democratic, prosperous, and happy.

　　Liu Nongjun, Commander of the 3rd Paratrooper Regiment, Jiang Jian, Deputy Commander, leading all officers and soldiers.
