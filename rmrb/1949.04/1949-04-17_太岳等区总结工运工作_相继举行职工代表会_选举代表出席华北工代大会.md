　　[Comprehensive News from this Newspaper] In order to summarize past labor movements, determine future work directions, and elect representatives to attend the First North China Labor Representative Conference, the Taiyue, Ji-Lu-Yu, and Ji-Dong regions have successively convened employee representative conferences.

　　The Taiyue Employee Representative Conference opened on the 6th of this month and lasted for six days, closing on the 11th. A total of 39 representatives from various industries and revolutionary staff members attended the conference. At the meeting, Comrade Wei Heng of the Taiyue District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party encouraged everyone to improve industrial production in the Taiyue region and implement the labor movement policy and industrial policy of "developing production, promoting economic prosperity, taking into account both public and private interests, and benefiting both labor and capital." Comrade Wang Ping of the Trade Union conveyed the resolutions of the Labor University and put forward opinions on the future labor movement: it is necessary to unite all employees, formulate individual production plans, and, conditions permitting, launch production competitions to welcome the "May Day" Labor Day and celebrate the victorious opening of the North China Employee Representative Conference. In order to improve workers' welfare, each factory and mine should establish an employee welfare committee. In areas where trade union organizations are incomplete or non-existent, trade union organizations should be improved and established. And, from one or two private factories in Jin City, create experience in guaranteeing the implementation of labor-capital mutual benefit in order to promote it. The conference elected twelve people, including Wang Ping, as representatives to attend the North China Employee Representative Conference by secret ballot.
