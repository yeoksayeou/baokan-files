[Chahar News] The re-settled farmers in the Seventh District and the urban district of Huairou County are very concerned about the production problems of the farmers in the disaster areas of the county. The villages near the city in the Third, Fourth, and Sixth Districts were turned into "no-man's lands" by the Kuomintang bandit troops last year. The local grain, livestock, and farm implements were looted by the Kuomintang bandit troops, and most of the land was therefore abandoned, causing great difficulties for this year's production. After the start of spring plowing, after the organization and mobilization of the county cadres, the re-settled farmers in the Seventh District, taking advantage of the gap that their own land was becoming muddy and unsuitable for work, organized 100 head of cattle to "sell labor" in the disaster area on the 18th of last month. The re-settled farmers in the Xiatai Village area of the urban district also organized 15 head of cattle to help the disaster-stricken people of Qiaozizhuang with spring plowing. In addition, the re-settled farmers in the Seventh District and the urban district have also raised more than 30,000 kilograms of grain to relieve the affected villages. The re-settled farmers in the urban district also used 30 large carts and some furniture to help Beitaicun and other villages. The farmers in the disaster areas were grateful for this enthusiastic help, and said, "We must do a good job in production and ensure more grain production to repay everyone's help."

　　怀柔翻身农民援助灾区春耕
    【察哈尔讯】怀柔七区及城关区的翻身农民，对该县灾区农民的生产问题非常关切。该县三、四、六区靠城村庄，去年被国民党匪军造成了“无人区”，当地粮食、耕畜、农具被国民党匪军抢个精光，大部土地因此荒芜，造成了今年生产的很大困难。春耕开始后，经过县干部的组织动员，七区的翻身农民乘着自己的土地正在泛浆不能下地作活的空隙，于上月十八日组织好一百犋耕畜到灾区“卖犋”。城关区下台村一带的翻身农民，也组织了十五犋耕畜去帮助桥梓庄灾民春耕。此外，七区及城关区的翻身农民，更募集了三万多斤粮食救济受灾村庄，城关区的翻身农民还把三十辆大车和一部份家具救济了北台等村。灾区农民得到这些热情援助，都感激地说：“一定要搞好生产，保证多打粮食，来答谢大家的帮助。”
