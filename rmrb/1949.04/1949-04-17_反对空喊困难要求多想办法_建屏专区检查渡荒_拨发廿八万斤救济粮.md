[Chahar News] Jianping Prefecture in Chahar Province recently inspected famine relief work and discovered that some leaders were echoing the masses in lamenting difficulties instead of actively seeking ways to increase production. They were solely relying on relief without proactively leading the masses to engage in self-salvation through production. They failed to address difficulties faced by disaster areas, such as seeds, livestock, and fertilizer, through organized methods. The promotion societies were also insufficient in utilizing existing agricultural loans to support the production of disaster-stricken masses. Some counties even believed the disaster situation was so severe that it was difficult to survive in the present circumstances, thus implicitly relaxing their leadership in spring plowing production. Regarding the aforementioned biases, the Prefectural Commissioner's Office instructed all counties to conduct serious inspections, promptly rectify them, and actively seek various production avenues based on different regions and conditions, organizing the masses for self-salvation through production. Promotion societies and industrial and commercial departments should do their best to purchase sideline products, open up sales channels, supply raw materials, and organize transportation to support the production of disaster-stricken masses. It was also decided to establish production relief committees in five counties, including Zhengding and Lingshou, with the participation of relevant departments, to unify leadership in relief work and achieve results.

[Another News] Jianping Prefectural Commissioner's Office in Chahar Province recently allocated 280,000 jin of relief grain and instructed its subordinates to use it strategically through production, transforming the grain into means of production as much as possible, or into bran, chaff, dried vegetables, and other relief foods, to maximize its effectiveness.

　　反对空喊困难要求多想办法
  　建屏专区检查渡荒
  　拨发廿八万斤救济粮
    【察哈尔讯】察哈尔建屏专区顷检查渡荒工作，发现有的领导上跟着群众喊困难，而不积极寻找生产门路；单纯依靠救济，不去主动领导群众进行生产自救；对灾区种籽、畜力、肥料等困难，没有以组织起来的方法去解决。推进社使用现有的农贷扶助灾区群众生产也很不够。甚至有的县份认为灾情严重，当前生活难以渡过，因而对领导春耕生产无形放松。对上述偏向，专署指示各县必须认真检查，迅速纠正，并要切实依据不同地区、不同条件积极寻找各种生产门路，组织群众生产自救。推进社、工商部门应尽力收买副业成品，打开销路，供给原料，组织运输，以扶持灾区群众生产。并决定正定、灵寿等五县成立生产救灾委员会，吸收各有关部门参加，统一领导救灾工作，做出成绩。
    【又讯】察省建屏专署顷拨发救济粮二十八万斤，并指示所属通过生产，有重点的使用，尽可能把粮食变成生产资料，或麸、糠、干菜等救济食物，以扩大效用。　（察省建屏专署实业科通讯小组）
