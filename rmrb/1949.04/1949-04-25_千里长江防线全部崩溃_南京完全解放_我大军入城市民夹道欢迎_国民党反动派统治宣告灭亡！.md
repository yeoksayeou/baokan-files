　　Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 24th, 10:00 AM: The People's Liberation Army entered Nanjing at 12:00 AM on the 23rd through Xiaguan via Yijiangmen.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 24th, 3:00 PM: Nanjing, the Kuomintang's counter-revolutionary center for twenty-two years, was liberated by the People's Liberation Army at midnight on the 23rd. The reactionary rule of the Kuomintang is declared over. After entering the city, the People's Liberation Army was warmly welcomed by students and citizens, with male and female students offering flowers to the Liberation Army as a sign of respect. The People's Liberation Army has issued a proclamation to reassure the people, the city is stable, and shops are open for business as usual. The fact that the People's Liberation Army captured this first major city in all of China within three days of launching the Yangtze River Crossing Campaign demonstrates the power of the Liberation Army; the Kuomintang bandit troops collapsed at the first touch and were unable to mount any organized resistance.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 24th, 6:00 AM: Under the attack of the People's Liberation Army's million-strong forces, the entire thousand-li Kuomintang Yangtze River defense line has collapsed, and the Nanjing Kuomintang reactionary traitorous government declared its demise yesterday. Li Zongren, He Yingqin, and the Kuomintang troops in Nanjing fled Nanjing yesterday morning. Li and He escaped to Shanghai by plane. The Kuomintang Nanjing garrison troops and military police fled along the Nanjing-Hangzhou Highway. The Kuomintang army in Pukou withdrew to Nanjing on the 22nd and fled along the Nanjing-Hangzhou Road together on the 23rd. The Kuomintang troops in Wuhu and Zhenjiang also fled in disarray in the same direction. The People's Liberation Army is advancing rapidly towards Nanjing, and if they did not enter the city last night, they may enter the city today. The people of Nanjing are waiting for the People's Liberation Army. During the time when the Kuomintang army had left Nanjing and the People's Liberation Army had not yet entered the city, the people of Nanjing organized a Public Security Maintenance Committee yesterday and sent a telegram to Chairman Mao Zedong at 6:00 PM yesterday, welcoming the People's Liberation Army. The telegram stated: "Chairman Mao's esteemed attention: The Nanjing garrison withdrew on the 23rd. For the sake of safety, the people of Nanjing jointly initiated the organization of a Public Security Maintenance Committee, with Ma Qingyuan as the chairman, Wu Yifang as the vice-chairman, and thirteen committee members. The local area is still stable. We respectfully request that you instruct the field army outside Nanjing to peacefully receive Nanjing in order to comfort the people's hopes. Please also telegraph the date of entry into the city for welcome preparations." Respectfully, Ma Qingyuan, Chairman of the Nanjing Security Committee, Wu Yifang, Vice Chairman, and committee members.
