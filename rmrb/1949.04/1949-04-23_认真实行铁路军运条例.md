　　Conscientiously Implement the Railway Military Transport Regulations
　　The Chinese People's Revolutionary Military Commission promulgated the Interim Railway Military Transport Regulations on the 10th of this month. This regulation is of great significance to the victory of the Chinese people's liberation cause and to the development of the New Democratic national economy.
　　The purpose of this regulation, as stated in the general principles of the regulation, is "to ensure the smooth flow of railway military transport and to ensure the rational use of railway transport without wasting railway transport capacity." Ensuring the smooth flow of military transport is the most important task of the current people's railway transportation. This is required by the highest current interests of the Chinese people. Without this guarantee, the Chinese people's liberation cause will suffer losses. It is by no means an easy task to ensure the completion of this task. Thanks to the heroic fighting of the People's Liberation Army and the hundreds of millions of people, and thanks to the arduous efforts of all railway employees and all party, government, military and civilians in the liberated areas, our people's railway industry has grown from nothing, from small to large, and has now developed to a large scale. However, our existing railways, vehicles, employees and equipment are clearly not enough to meet the actual needs. Our military transport is large in quantity and long in distance. Moreover, in addition to military transport, railway transport must also bear the huge needs of the national economy. Therefore, in order to first ensure the smooth flow of military transport and to complete the non-military national economic transport tasks, our railway transport must pay special attention to rational and planned organization, and must gradually put the railway, as a state enterprise, on the right track and towards enterprise. The Interim Railway Military Transport Regulations promulgated by the Chinese People's Revolutionary Military Commission are designed to solve this problem.
　　The Interim Railway Military Transport Regulations clearly define military transport as "all agencies directly under the Military Commission, field armies, corps headquarters, armies, military regions, military sub-regions, and armed forces above independent regiments, for the purpose of troop transfer, supply, combat, military industry, military supplies, military equipment, and military medicine." Everything else is not within the scope of military transport. In the past, due to the lack of such clear regulations, some troops regarded transportation for the purpose of engaging in industrial and agricultural production or exchanging materials as military transport, some local armed forces below the county level regarded personnel transfers and material supply as military transport, and some local party and government agencies also regarded daily necessities and equipment as military transport, and even some public enterprises and factories regarded general materials and equipment other than military supplies as military transport. As a result, railway transport was burdened with extremely complex "military transport", and the real military transport could not be carried out quickly. Therefore, it is very necessary to clearly divide the scope of military and non-military transport.
　　The Interim Railway Military Transport Regulations strictly stipulate the system and procedures for planning and handling military transport, greatly strengthening the planning of military transport. The regulations stipulate that military transport required for emergency troop transfers and combat shall be jointly formulated by the field armies or first-level military regions and the Railway Department of the Military Commission; the rear transport of military industry, military equipment, military supplies, and health departments shall be jointly formulated by the logistics departments of the field armies or first-level military regions and the Railway Department of the Military Commission into monthly transport plans; other military transport should also be planned and handled in advance as much as possible. The regulations stipulate that all military transport shall be negotiated with the relevant units of the railway bureau by a certain military agency. In the past, the planning of military transport in various places was very insufficient, sometimes even without any plan. Regardless of the unit, no matter when, they randomly asked the railway bureau for cars, even detained cars at will, without making plans themselves or notifying the railway bureau in advance, so that the railway bureau could not control the operation of trains, and the railway transport capacity could not be rationally and fully utilized, and military transport could not be smooth and rapid, and could not be completed on schedule. Railways are modern means of transportation and must have a high degree of planning and organization. The chaotic phenomenon of unplanned and unorganized military transport must end.
　　The Interim Railway Military Transport Regulations also stipulate the calculation of military transport costs and the military transport check system, which is of great significance for overcoming the waste of railway transport capacity and for promoting the enterprise of railway transport. In the past, the regulations on military transport costs and the military transport check system were not strict, many troops and agencies did not pay attention to saving, and the waste of arbitrarily transferring vehicles and empty vehicles was very serious, and the railway enterprise therefore suffered reduced income and accumulated losses, and economic accounting could not be accurate. If this situation continues to develop, not only is it impossible to develop the railway industry, but it is also extremely difficult to maintain the status quo. Therefore, it is absolutely necessary to strictly implement railway enterprise, stipulate reasonable military transport costs and a military transport check system.
　　In addition, the Interim Railway Military Transport Regulations also stipulate the discipline that railway personnel and military industrial personnel should strictly abide by. Railway personnel should conscientiously and responsibly implement the military transport plan, not neglect their duties, not delay or make things difficult, keep military transport secrets, and help escort personnel. Army personnel should abide by railway regulations, not force or refuse to drive, stop, hook up, or shunt trains, not occupy railway dedicated telephones, not scold or beat railway employees, and pay transportation fees and fares in accordance with regulations. These disciplinary regulations are designed to ensure the completion of the military transport plan, while strengthening the unity and cooperation between railway employees and army commanders and fighters.
　　The promulgation of the Interim Railway Military Transport Regulations is a very important event in the short history of the development of people's railways. Many of the shortcomings in our military transport and even general railway transport in the past were unavoidable because we were in a decentralized rural environment for a long time and lacked experience in managing people's railways, but some were completely avoidable and should be avoided or overcome. Now that our center of work has shifted from the countryside to the cities, our task of building the country and restoring and developing the national economy has become increasingly huge, and the scale of military transport has become increasingly difficult due to the victory throughout the country. Therefore, we urgently need to manage railway transport well, first of all railway military transport. The various items stipulated in the Interim Railway Military Transport Regulations mainly solve some of the shortcomings that currently exist in military transport. At the same time, its implementation will greatly improve the planning and efficiency of our entire railway transport industry. We hope that railway, troops, and local party and government agencies in various places will conscientiously study and resolutely implement these regulations, and publicize and explain these regulations to all relevant personnel, in order to greatly improve the planning and efficiency of our military transport and even general railway transport, so that our railway industry will flourish.

### 认真实行铁路军运条例

　　认真实行铁路军运条例
    中国人民革命军事委员会于本月十日公布了铁路军运暂行条例。这个条例，对于中国人民解放事业的胜利，对于新民主主义国民经济的发展，都有很大的意义。
    这个条例的目的，正如条例总则中所说的，“在于既保证铁路军事运输之顺畅，又保证合理使用铁路运输而不浪费铁路运输力”。保证军事运输的顺畅，是当前人民铁路运输中第一等的重大任务。这是中国人民的当前最高利益所要求的。没有这种保证，中国人民的解放事业就要蒙受损失。要保证这个任务的完成，决不是轻而易举的事情。我们的人民铁路事业，由于人民解放军和千百万人民的英勇战斗，由于全解放区铁路员工和全体党政军民的艰苦努力，从无到有，从小到大，现在已经发展到很大的规模。但是，我们已有的铁路、车辆、员工和器材，要满足实际的需要，显然是不够的，我们的军事运输，数量既大，距离又远。而且，军运之外，铁路运输还要负担国民经济的巨大需要。因此，为要首先保证军事运输的顺畅，又要完成非军事的国民经济的运输任务，我们的铁路运输必须特别注意合理的、有计划的组织工作，必须使作为国家企业的铁路逐步走向正轨，走向企业化。中国人民革命军事委员会颁布的铁路军运暂行条例，为的就是解决这个问题。
    铁路军运暂行条例明确地规定了军运的定义，“即军委会直属各机关、各野战军、各兵团司令部、各军、各军区、各军分区、各独立团以上之武装部队，以调防、补给、作战、军工、军需、军械、军医为目的方为军运”。其他一切均不属于军运范围。过去由于没有这种明确的规定，因而有些部队把以从事工农业生产或交换物资为目的的运输也算作军运，有些县以下的地方武装将人员的调动和物资的供给也算作军运，有些地方党政机关也把日常所需物资器材当作军运，甚至有些公营企业工厂也把非军需的一般物资器材当作军运。其结果，铁路运输负荷了庞杂无比的“军运”，真正的军运即因此而不能迅速进行。所以明确地划分军运与非军运的范围是非常必要的。
    铁路军运暂行条例严格地规定了筹划和办理军运的制度和手续，大大加强军运的计划性。条例规定：为实行紧急调防作战所需的军运，由各野战军或一级军区，直接与军委会铁道部共同制订运输计划；军工、军械、军需、卫生部门的后方运输，由各野战军的或各一级军区的后勤部与铁道部共同制订每月运输计划；其他军运亦应尽可能做到预先筹划，预先办理。条例规定：所有军运，均由一定军事机关向路局的一定单位交涉。过去各地军运的计划性很不够，有时甚至毫无计划。不管什么单位，无论什么时候，随便乱向路局要车，甚至随便扣车，自己既不定计划，也没有预先通知路局，以致路局无法控制列车的运行，铁路的运输力也无法合理地充分地发挥起来，军运也就不能顺畅迅速，不能按期完成。铁路是近代化的交通工具，须要有高度的计划性和组织性。军运中的无计划无组织的混乱现象必须结束。
    铁路军运暂行条例又规定了军运费用的计算和军运支票制度，这对于克服铁路运输力的浪费现象，对于促成铁路运输的企业化，有着重大的意义。过去军运费用规定和军运支票制度不严，许多部队机关毫不注意节约，滥调车辆、空装车辆的浪费现象很严重，而铁道企业即因此收入减少，亏损累累，经济核算也无法精确。这种情况如果继续发展下去，不但发展铁路事业谈不上，而且维持现状也极为困难。所以严格实行铁路企业化，规定合理的军运费用和军运支票制度是完全必要的。
    此外，铁路军运暂行条例还规定了铁路人员和军工人员应严格遵守的纪律。铁路人员应认真负责地执行军运计划，不玩忽职守，不延误刁难，保守军运秘密，帮助押运人员。军队人员应恪守铁路规章，不强迫或拒绝开车、停车、挂车、调车，不占用铁路专用电话，不打骂铁路员工，照章缴纳运费和车费。这些纪律规定，为的是保证军运计划的完成，同时又加强铁路员工与军队指战员的团结合作。
    铁路军运暂行条例的颁布，在人民铁路的短短发展史上是很重要的事件。我们军事运输以至一般铁路运输在过去时期中的许多缺点，由于我们过去长期处于分散的农村环境，管理人民铁路的经验不足，有些是不可避免的，但有些是完全可以而且应当避免或克服的。现在我们的工作中心已自乡村转至城市，我们建设国家、恢复与发展国民经济的任务已愈见巨大，军事运输的规模亦因走向全国胜利而益形艰巨，因此我们更加迫切地需要很好地管理铁路运输，首先是铁路军事运输。铁路军运暂行条例中所规定的各项，主要是解决目前军运中所存在的一些缺点，同时，它的实行，将大大改善我们整个铁路运输事业。我们希望各地铁路、部队及地方党政机关认真研究和坚决执行这个条例，并向一切有关人员宣传解释这个条例，以期大大改进我们的军事运输以至一般铁路运输的计划性和效率，使我们的铁路事业蒸蒸日上。（新华社北平二十二日电）
