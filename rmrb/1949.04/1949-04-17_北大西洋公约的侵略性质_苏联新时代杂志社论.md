　　The Aggressive Nature of the North Atlantic Treaty
　　Editorial from the Soviet New Era Magazine
　　The text of the North Atlantic Treaty was published on March 18th, more than two weeks before the treaty was signed. Simultaneously with the publication of the treaty, its drafters launched a vigorous propaganda campaign, attempting to create a smokescreen of lies to obscure the true nature of the North Atlantic Treaty.

　　However, this plan did not succeed. The terms of the treaty fully confirm the assessment of it in the statement of the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs on January 29, 1949. This statement exposed the aggressive purpose of the North Atlantic Treaty and convincingly proved that it violated both the principles and goals of the United Nations and the obligations assumed by the United States, Britain, and France in other treaties and agreements. These include the Anglo-Soviet Treaty of 1942, the Franco-Soviet Treaty of 1944, the Yalta and Potsdam conferences, and other agreements reached at Allied representative conferences during and after the Second World War. In these treaties and agreements, the United States, Britain, and France undertook obligations to cooperate in safeguarding world peace and international security and to strengthen the United Nations.

　　The advocates of the North Atlantic Treaty claim that the treaty is “purely defensive.” This fabrication can only deceive the gullible. The Soviet Union is the only major power excluded from the treaty, while the United States, Britain, and France are all participants. Based solely on this fact, it is easy to see that the treaty is directed against the Soviet Union. Accompanying the clamor about the treaty is a frantic propaganda campaign vilifying the democratic and socialist camp and anti-Soviet hysteria. Official representatives of Western countries have also admitted that the treaty is aimed at the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries. But at the same time, even sworn enemies of the Soviet Union like Dulles cannot deny the Soviet Union's desire for peace. It is clear to everyone that none of the countries that signed the North Atlantic Treaty are threatened by the Soviet Union in any way. The malicious clamor about the "Soviet" threat is intended only to conceal the aggressive purpose of the treaty.

　　American and British politicians are trying to justify the necessity of the North Atlantic Treaty on the completely false basis that cooperation between Western countries and the Soviet Union has proven impossible. However, everyone knows who is truly undermining cooperation between the great powers. President Truman's recent refusal to conclude a peace treaty with the Soviet Union once again proves that the ruling groups in Washington and their Western European satellites are unwilling to adjust relations with the Soviet Union and are obstructing every action in this direction.

　　To defend their policies, the advocates of the North Atlantic Treaty have repeatedly referred to the defensive treaties concluded between the Soviet Union and the People's Democratic countries. However, all these treaties of friendship and mutual assistance are bilateral in nature and are only aimed at the revival of German aggression. It is extremely absurd to interpret these treaties as being directed in any way against those countries that participated in the anti-Hitler coalition and pledged to cooperate in maintaining lasting peace. The Soviet Union has concluded similar treaties aimed at preventing the revival of German aggression not only with the People's Democratic countries, but also with Britain and France.

　　The advocates of the North Atlantic Treaty are trying to prove that the treaty was concluded because the United Nations is weak and powerless. However, the treaty does far from strengthening the United Nations organization and undermines the foundations of the United Nations, because it indicates the establishment of military groups of states pursuing aggressive purposes, which is absolutely incompatible with the principles of the United Nations Charter.

　　Attempts to portray the North Atlantic Treaty as a regional agreement within the scope of the United Nations Charter also cannot withstand the slightest criticism. How can people seriously say that a treaty including countries such as Canada and Luxembourg has any regional basis? Moreover, Italy and Portugal, which are not members of the United Nations, are also being dragged into the treaty. It is no secret that the initiators of the North Atlantic Treaty want to expand the region of the treaty to three-quarters of the globe. In their statements when the North Atlantic Treaty was published, Acheson and Bevin emphasized the concern of the United States and Britain for areas not within the treaty, especially Greece, Turkey, and Iran. The newspapers of monopoly capital have already discovered that the Mediterranean is a "bay of the Atlantic." They also reported that a Pacific treaty is being drafted as a supplement to the North Atlantic Treaty.

　　The North Atlantic Treaty directly contradicts Article 53 of the United Nations Charter. This article clearly states that no enforcement action may be taken pursuant to regional arrangements without the authorization of the Security Council. However, Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty stipulates that signatory states may use force without the approval of the Security Council.

　　The advocates of the North Atlantic Treaty know that the people love peace and abhor the idea of aggressive war, therefore, they argue with great force that the treaty is an instrument for defending peace. But the more politicians with aggressive ambitions talk about peace, the further they themselves depart from peace.

　　The North Atlantic Treaty is a typical tool of aggressive policy. Some countries, including the US-British bloc, refuse to adopt a policy of collective security, and under the false pretext of peace—a pretext only intended to relax the vigilance of the people—they have adopted a policy of military alliances and preparations for war, and the North Atlantic Treaty is the culmination of such actions.

　　The signatory countries of the North Atlantic Treaty have engaged in an arms race in peacetime that is absolutely unnecessary for their defense, including measures such as expanding all branches of the armed forces, plans for the use of atomic weapons, the storage of atomic bombs that are purely offensive weapons, and the construction of networks of air and naval bases. It is clear to everyone without prejudice that these extensive military measures, as well as the expansion of the US-British Joint Staff in Washington three and a half years after the end of the war, the establishment of the Western European Union Staff in Fontainebleau, and the intention to immediately establish the Defense Committee stipulated in the North Atlantic Treaty—all this is by no means defensive measures. Such measures only exacerbate unease, panic, and war frenzy, and the result is being exploited by the instigators of a new war. So where is the assumed peaceful nature of the treaty?

　　The warmongers, in planning the North Atlantic Treaty, have not even been able to effectively conceal its adventurous nature. According to Article 6 of the treaty, any incident involving a ship or aircraft in the Atlantic region from the Arctic to the Tropic of Cancer could serve as a pretext for putting the treaty into action. We know very well from history that war instigators stage such incidents when they consider them advantageous and appropriate. As a result, the North Atlantic Treaty means that when the robbers on the other side of the Atlantic consider the time appropriate to realize their foolish plan to establish world hegemony by force, the people of Western European countries—Britain, France, Denmark, Norway, Belgium, and the Netherlands—will have to shed blood for the benefit of American imperialism.

　　The organizers of the North Atlantic Treaty, in accordance with this general line of instigating war, place the restoration of the German army and Japanese aggression and militarism in a prominent position in their plans. They are now colluding with the remnants of fascism, with all the disciples and grandchildren of Hitler, Mussolini, and Hirota under their banner. At a time when peace-loving people of all countries are full of determination to prevent the revival of German aggression in Europe and Japanese aggression in Asia, and when this goal is one of the main tasks of the United Nations, the proponents of the North Atlantic Treaty are enthusiastically and hastily establishing strategic bridgeheads in West Germany, rebuilding the military-economic base of German imperialism, and plotting to rebuild the German army as mercenaries for those who newly aspire to dominate the world.

　　The advocates of the North Atlantic Treaty insist that their sole motive is—as stated in the preamble to the treaty—"to safeguard the freedom, common heritage and civilization of their peoples, founded on the principles of democracy, individual liberty and the rule of law." American reactionaries are trying to imitate all the habits of their Nazi ancestors and pretend to be "defenders of democracy," but they still show an extremely ugly face. Including fascist Portugal in the list of contracting states, flirting with Franco's Spain, and supporting the Athenian executioners who massacre the Greek people and the Turkish army are the final touches to the "defending democracy" volume of the North Atlantic Treaty.

　　In reality, this treaty is a conspiracy of reactionary anti-people groups who are prepared to make the people bleed profusely in order to save their economic and political systems, which have already rotted to the core. It is not without reason that democrats call this treaty a new version of the notorious "Holy Alliance" of the first half of the last century. However, under the irresistible growing resistance of the people, the North Atlantic Treaty will inevitably be crushed.

　　The advocates of the North Atlantic Treaty want to make people believe that the treaty does not include American interference in the internal affairs of Western European countries. However, even before the treaty was published, newspapers claimed that the treaty contained secret clauses stipulating that the United States could intervene militarily in the internal affairs of a contracting state under the fabricated pretext that the country was suffering from internal aggression or indirect aggression. We know that reactionaries often apply the term internal aggression or indirect aggression to any attempt by the people to realize its ambitions.

　　But in addition to the secret clauses, the already published text of the treaty itself illustrates the entire scale of American interference in the internal affairs of Western European countries. Article 4 of the treaty specifically states in intentionally vague terms that a threat to "political independence" is an excuse for implementing the mutual military obligations of the contracting states. French Foreign Minister Schuman was forced to declare when receiving reporters on March 18 that strikes should not necessarily be regarded as a threat to "political independence." However, the democratic side in France has every reason to point out that as long as the ruling group declares a strike such as the miners' strike in October 1948 as a "riot," the United States will have an excuse to carry out armed intervention. As long as a movement is declared to be "incited and supported by foreign countries" in the same way that the French ruling group fabricated rumors and slandered the miners' strike, the entire machine of the North Atlantic Treaty can be put into operation immediately. This is so obvious that no fair-minded person can fail to see it. The North Atlantic Treaty makes it possible for the reactionaries in any Western European country to enlist the aid of American bayonets whenever the people engage in any effort to fight for their rights.

　　Therefore, the purpose of the North Atlantic Treaty is to intimidate countries and people who are unwilling to obey the US-British bloc, which hopes to dominate the world. But the Second World War has once again proved that such a desire is an absolute fantasy. The Second World War ended with the destruction of fascist Germany, which attempted to realize its insane plan to dominate the world. Although the American and British imperialists dream of establishing world hegemony, this ambition is equally unworkable.

　　Exposing the aggressive nature of the North Atlantic Treaty is one of the main tasks of the struggle to defend peace. The forces that uphold peace are incomparably stronger than the forces that advocate war. In every country, those who uphold peace account for the overwhelming majority of the people, while the warmongers are merely a pitiful handful of large commercial monopolists who pursue private interests and their political and military servants. The forces of peace are so strong that no one can intimidate them. Every day there is new and most convincing proof of this.

### 北大西洋公约的侵略性质　苏联新时代杂志社论

　　北大西洋公约的侵略性质
  　苏联新时代杂志社论
    北大西洋公约的条文，在该公约签字两周余以前于三月十八日公布。与公约公布的同时，公约的缔订者进行了猛烈的宣传运动，企图造成谎骗的烟幕来遮掩北大西洋公约的真实性质。
    但是，这个计划没有达到目的。公约的条件，充分证实了苏联外交部一九四九年一月二十九日声明中对它的论断。这一声明暴露了北大西洋公约的侵略目的，令人信服地证明了它既违背联合国的原则和目标，也违背美英法在其他条约和协定中所担承了的义务。这就是一九四二年的英苏条约，一九四四年的法苏条约，雅尔塔、波茨坦会议以及其他第二次世界大战期间和战后期间盟国代表会议上所达到的各项协定。在这些条约和协定中，美英法曾担承了合作以保障世界和平与国际安全及加强联合国的义务。
    北大西洋公约的鼓吹者力称，公约是“纯粹防御性”的。这种捏造只能欺骗轻信的人。苏联是唯一被排除在公约之外的大国，而美英法都参加了公约。只有根据这个事实就很容易地看到公约是针对苏联的。伴随着关于公约的吵扰的，是诬蔑民主和社会主义阵营的疯狂宣传和反苏歇斯底里。西方国家的官方代表也承认公约是针对苏联和人民民主国家的。但是，在同时，甚至连苏联的死敌如杜勒斯之流，也都无法否认苏联愿望和平。一切的人都很清楚，北大西洋公约签字国中，没有任何一个国家受到苏联的任何威胁。关于“苏联”威胁的恶意狂叫，其用意只是在于掩遮公约的侵略目的。
    美英政治家力图以完全虚伪的根据，说什么西方国家与苏联合作已经证明是不可能的，这样来辩护北大西洋公约的必要性。但是，每一个人都知道真正破坏大国合作的是谁。杜鲁门总统最近曾拒绝与苏联缔结和平公约，这再度证明华盛顿统治集团及其西欧卫星不愿意调整与苏联的关系，并阻挠这个方向上的每一行动的。
    为了辩护他们的政策，北大西洋公约的鼓吹者，曾经多次提到苏联与人民民主国家间所缔结的防御性公约。但是，所有这些友好互助条约都是双边性质的，而且只是针对德国侵略之复活的。把这些条约解释为在任何情形下都是反对那些参加反希特勒联合的和保证自己在维护持久和平中合作的国家，这是极端荒谬的。苏联不仅与人民民主国家，而且也与英、法缔结了旨在反对德国侵略复活的类似条约。
    北大西洋公约的鼓吹者，力图证明公约的缔结是因为联合国软弱无力。但是，该公约远不能加强联合国组织，并且是损害联合国基础的，因为它指明要建立追求侵略目的的军事性的国家集团，这是与联合国宪章的原则绝不相容的。
    企图把北大西洋公约说成是联合国宪章范围内区域性协议的条约，也经不起一点点的批评。人民如何能够严肃地说，包括有象加拿大和卢森堡在内的公约，有什么区域性的基础呢？何况非联合国会员国的意大利、葡萄牙，也正被拖进公约呢？北大西洋公约的发起者，想把该公约的区域扩大到地球的四分之三上面去，这并非秘密。艾奇逊和贝文在公布北大西洋公约时发表的声明中，曾强调美、英关心不在条约之内的地区，特别是希腊、土耳其和伊朗。独占资本的报纸，已经发现地中海是“大西洋的港湾”了。它们又报道说，太平洋公约也在制订中，该约是作为北大西洋公约之补充的。
    北大西洋公约是直接与联合国宪章第五十三条相抵触的。该条明白申述，未得安理会的授权，不得根据区域协定采取任何执行行动。但是，北大西洋公约的第五条规定，不得安理会的批准，签字国即可使用武力。
    北大西洋公约的鼓吹者，知道人民热爱和平，并憎恶侵略战争的想法，因此，它们以很大的力量证明公约是保卫和平的工具。但是，怀有侵略野心的政客们关于和平的谈论越多，他们自己就离开和平越远。
    北大西洋公约是侵略政策的典型工具。包括美英集团在内的一些国家，拒绝采取集体安全政策，他们在虚伪的和平借口——这种借口只是打算松懈人民的警惕——下采取了军事联盟和备战政策，北大西洋公约就是这种行动的顶点。
    北大西洋公约的签字国，已在和平时期从事了他们的防务所绝对不需要的军备竞赛，其中包括了象扩大武装部队的一切部门的措施，应用原子武器的计划，储存纯粹作为进攻武器的原子弹，建筑空军和海军基地网等等。每一个不存偏见的人都很清楚这种广泛的军事措施，以及在战争结束以后三年半的时候扩大华盛顿的美英联合参谋部，在枫丹白露建立西欧联盟参谋部，以及打算立即建立北大西洋公约所规定的防务委员会——所有这一切，都决不是防御性的措施。这种措施只会加重不安、惊恐和战争狂，其结果就是为新战争的煽动者所利用。那么，公约所假定的和平性质究竟在那里呢？
    战争贩子在策划北大西洋公约时，甚至未能有效地掩盖它的冒险性质。依照公约的第六条，在大西洋上自北极到北回归线的地区，只要任何一只船或一架飞机出事，就可能作为使公约进入行动的借口。我们从历史上知道得很清楚：当战争挑拨者认为有利与合适时，他们就演出这种事件。结果，北大西洋公约就表示：在大西洋彼岸的强盗认为是企图实现他们以强力建立世界霸权的蠢笨计划的适当时机，西欧各国——英、法、丹、挪、比、荷——的人民，便将不得不为美帝国主义的利益流血。
    北大西洋公约的组织者们，按照这种挑拨战争的总路线，把恢复德国的军队和日本的侵略与军国主义放在他们计划中的显要地位。他们现在正纠合法西斯主义的残渣，希特勒、墨索里尼和广田的一切徒子徒孙在他们的旗帜之下，在爱好和平的各国人民充满决心在欧洲阻止德国侵略和在亚洲阻止日本侵略死灰复燃的时候，在这一目标是联合国主要任务之一的时候，北大西洋公约的倡导人，却热烈而匆忙地在西德建立战略的桥头堡垒，重建德国帝国主义的军事经济基地，阴谋计划重建德国的军队，作为新的独霸世界的人们的雇佣兵。
    北大西洋公约的鼓吹者，硬说他们唯一的动机是——象公约序言所说的——“决心保障基于民主原则，个人自由及法治精神下的各国人民之自由，共同传统及文明”。美国反动派努力模仿他们纳粹老祖宗的一切习惯，装作“民主卫士”，但是，他们还是显出了一幅极丑恶的面貌。把法西斯葡萄牙列入缔约国的名单，与佛朗哥西班牙眉来眼去，支持屠杀希腊人民的雅典刽子手和土耳其的军队，这些是完成北大西洋公约“保卫民主”的图书的最后几笔点缀。
    实际上，这个公约是反动反人民集团的阴谋，他们准备使人民大流血，以拯救他们业已腐入骨髓的经济政治制度。民主人士把这个公约称为上世纪前半叶恶名昭著的“神圣同盟”的新版，这并不是没有道理的。但是，在人民的不可抗拒地增涨的反抗之下，北大西洋公约必然被粉碎。
    北大西洋公约的鼓吹者，想使人民相信，公约不包含美国对西欧国家内政的干涉。但是，甚至在该公约公布之前，报纸就声称该公约包含秘密条款，规定美国在某一缔约国遭受内部侵略或间接侵略的假造的口实下，武装干涉该国的内政。我们知道，反动派是经常把内部侵略或间接侵略这个名词加诸人民以实现它的任何尝试的。
    但是除了秘密条款之外，已经公布的公约条文本身，也说明了美国干涉西欧国家内政的整个规模。公约的第四条特别以有意含混的言词说到“政治独立”遭受威胁是实施缔约国相互军事义务的借口。法外长舒曼在三月十八日招待记者时被迫宣称，罢工不一定要被当作对“政治独立”的威胁。但是，法国民主方面却有一切根据指出，统治集团只要宣布诸如一九四八年十月矿工罢工那样的罢工为“暴动”，美国就有了进行武装干涉的借口。只要象法国统治集团造谣诬蔑矿工罢工那样，宣布一个运动是“由外国所鼓动和得到外国支持”的，北大西洋公约整个机器就可随即开动。这一点是如此地明显，任何公正不偏的人都不能不看见。北大西洋公约使得任何西欧国家的反动派有可能在人民从事任何争取其权利的努力时，就招请美国刺刀来援助。
    所以，北大西洋公约的用意，在于恫吓不愿听命于盼望称霸全球的美英集团的国家和人民。但是第二次世界大战已经再次证明了：这样的愿望是绝对的空想。第二次世界大战以妄图实现其统治世界的疯人计划的法西斯德国的毁灭告终。美英帝国主义者虽然梦想建立世界霸权，而这种野心同样是行不通的。
    揭露北大西洋公约的侵略性质，是保卫和平斗争的主要任务之一。拥护和平的力量较诸主张战争的力量是无比的强大。在每个国家中，拥护和平的人们都占人民的压倒多数，而战争贩子则仅仅是可怜的一小撮追求私利的大商业独占资本家和他们政治军事的仆从而已。和平的力量如此强大，没有人能够吓倒他们。这一点，每天都有新的最令人信服的证明。
