　　Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, 20th: Berlin dispatch: Local newspapers recently published news of another measure by the Soviet military government to aid the German national economy. The German Economic Commission had requested the Soviet Military Administration in Germany last year to allocate some airplanes for the purpose of eradicating pests in Berlin. After reviewing the request of the German Economic Commission, General Chuikov ordered the allocation of the required number of aircraft, as well as flight and technical personnel, for this purpose. According to reports, Soviet aircraft will spray pesticide over 40,000 hectares of German Berlin. This measure will save no less than eight million cubic meters of German timber used for trade.
