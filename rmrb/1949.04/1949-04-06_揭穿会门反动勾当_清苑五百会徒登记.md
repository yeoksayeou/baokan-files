　　Exposing the Reactionary Activities of Secret Societies
  　500 Members Register in Qingyuan

　　[Hebei News] Qingyuan County thoroughly disbanded superstitious societies. Recently, a total of 561 principal members, such as preachers, altar masters, and masters, from thirteen superstitious groups including Yiguandao, Shengxiandao, Chahuadao, and Hunwendao, registered with the county and handed over a large number of statues, offering tables, and ritual paraphernalia. During the registration, key members were sharply exposed based on interrogation materials, and policy education was administered to make them aware of their crimes of harming themselves and others. Those who were coerced were educated to recognize the fact that they had been fooled, prompting them to change and concentrate on production. Those who had conclusive evidence of undermining the people's interests and were still stubbornly refusing to repent were given administrative penalties. According to the county, superstitious societies, under the instigation of Japanese puppets and Chiang Kai-shek's secret agents, carried out reactionary activities and constantly disrupted revolutionary work. For example, during the land reform, Yiguandao preacher Wang Guojun instructed his followers: do not participate in the emancipation, do not share things; but told landlords and rich peasants: "Be patient! Wait until later!" implying that landlords would counterattack the peasants in the future. During the conscription work, they also carried out sabotage propaganda, educating their disciples that being a soldier in the Eighth Route Army earned no money, but being a "Nationalist soldier" earned money. During the registration, through education, many honest peasants who had been deceived regretted it. For example, tenant farmer Tian Zhongsheng, an altar master, said: "I used to have no house or land. Now I have been given land and a house. I was only emancipated under the leadership of the Communist Party, but I failed to produce well. Now I have awakened." The master of the Xiaoxiangdao in Yangcheng Village said: "I won't be in this Dao anymore. It wasted my effort and ruined my money. Each time I held a ceremony, it would cost several thousand (Renminbi). Twenty or thirty people ate at my house, and several people had to serve them. Over the years, I have not cultivated anything, but I have become worse and worse." The people in Hunwendao in Dabaiguan Village also registered.

　　[Chahar News] Zhu Jiaying in the sixth district of Fuping recently exposed the crime of the Huangxiangdao superstitious organization in undermining revolutionary work. The Dao was organized in 1937 by Chen San from Donggou Village, first district, Wutai County, Shanxi Province, under Yan Xishan. In the past two years, it has developed to more than 300 followers in eight villages including Sandaoling and Liuzhugou. They were particularly active in undermining land reform, so the work in Zhu Jiaying was very bad. After the local government had conducted several days of investigation and grasped conclusive evidence, they exposed it at the villagers' meeting. Dao leader Chen San fled in fear of punishment, and the other key figures, Zheng Shuanjie and two others, were arrested and sent to the county.

　　揭穿会门反动勾当
  　清苑五百会徒登记
    【冀中讯】清苑县彻底解散迷信道门。最近到县登记者计有一贯道、圣贤道、茶华道、混文道等十三种迷信团体包括首要分子如点传师、坛主、师父共五百六十一名，并缴出大批神像、神案及仪式用具。在登记中对首要分子结合侦讯材料予以尖锐揭发，并施以政策教育，使其认识到害己害人的罪行；对胁从者通过教育使其认识被愚弄的事实，促其转变，安心生产；对破坏人民利益证据确凿尚狡黠诡辩坚决不愿悔过者，予以行政处分。按该县迷信道门，曾在日伪蒋特主使下，进行反动活动，不断破坏革命工作：如在土地改革时，一贯道点传师王国俊，向其道徒布置：不要参加翻身，不要分东西；而对地主、富农则说：“忍忍吧！等以后再说！”暗示地主以后向农民反攻。在参军工作中，他们也进行破坏宣传。教育其门徒说：当八路军没钱，当“国军”有钱。在登记中，通过教育，很多被蒙蔽的老实农民都后悔了，如雇农田仲生是个坛主，他说：“我过去无房无地，现在我分了地分了房，我是在共产党领导下才翻的身，可是我没能好好生产，现在我醒过来了。”杨城村小香道的老师父说：“以后我算不在这个道了，耽误了功夫糟蹋了钱：每集办供就得花好几千（人民币），二、三十个人在我家吃饭，还要好几个人伺候。这些年我什么也没修下，倒越闹越不好过了。”大白团村在混文道的也都登记了。

    【察哈尔讯】阜平六区朱家营最近揭破黄香道迷信组织的破坏革命工作的罪行。该道为阎特山西省五台县一区东沟村陈三于一九三七年在该村组织的。近二年中已发展到三道岭、六柱沟等八个村徒众三百余人。他们对破坏土地改革特别卖力，所以朱家营的工作很糟。当地政府经多日调查掌握确凿证据后，即在村民大会上予以揭露，道首陈三畏罪潜逃，即将其他首要人物郑栓姐等三人缉拿送县。
