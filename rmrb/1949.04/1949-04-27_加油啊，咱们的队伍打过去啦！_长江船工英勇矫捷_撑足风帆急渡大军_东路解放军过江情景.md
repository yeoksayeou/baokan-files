　　"Add oil! Our troops are crossing!"
    Yangtze River Boatmen Heroically and Agilely
    Hoist Full Sails to Rapidly Ferry the Army
　　Scene of the East Route People's Liberation Army Crossing the Yangtze River
    [Xinhua News Agency Yangtze River Front, 25th dispatch] East Route Front reporter Chen reports on the heroic scene of boatmen bravely carrying the People's Liberation Army to forcibly cross the Yangtze River: At 6:00 PM on the 21st, a northwest wind was still blowing on the river. At 7:00 PM, a southeast wind suddenly blew strongly, and the boatmen cheered in unison, "Chairman Mao is borrowing the east wind!" "This is the great fortune of the people!" Half an hour later, the rapid small fishing boats of the assault troops sailed out of the port, heading straight for the landing target like flying arrows. When the boat reached the center of the river, enemy bullets came head-on to intercept them. Special-class merit recipient boatman Xu Guanfu patted his chest and said to the assault leader, "I guarantee to get you across, no problem!" Bullets pierced the boat, and the soldiers all rushed to rescue and block the water. He calmly steered the rudder, allowing the injured boat to maintain its swallow-like agility and fly towards the south bank. Mei Lao'er, a female boatman who had lived on the water for more than thirty years, personally steered the rudder with the heroic spirit of a first-class merit recipient, crossing the river five times in one night. Young boatman Lu Xiaoniu was wounded in his hand, but still stubbornly went into the water to push the boat. When the boatmen carrying the assault troops were sailing empty north from the south bank, they encountered the second echelon of boats surging in the center of the river. They encouraged each other in the sound of artillery fire, saying, "Add oil! Our troops are crossing!" Both sides hoisted full sails and flew north and south. In less than five hours, a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army had all reached the opposite bank.

　　“加油啊，咱们的队伍打过去啦！”
    长江船工英勇矫捷
    撑足风帆急渡大军
  　东路解放军过江情景
    【新华社长江前线二十五日电】东路前线记者陈报道船工们英勇载送解放军强渡长江的情景说：二十一日下午六点钟，江上还刮着西北风。七点钟忽然东南风大作，船工们一齐欢呼，“毛主席借东风啦！”“这是人民的洪福啊！”半个钟头后，突击部队的快速小鱼船就驶出了港口，飞箭似地直取登陆目标。船到江心，敌人堵击的子弹迎面射来了，特等功臣船工徐官福拍着胸膛对突击长说：“保险送过去，没问题！”子弹把船打穿了，战士们都抢救堵水，他沉着地掌着舵，让负伤后的小船仍然保持着燕子般的矫捷，飞向南岸。曾经在水上生活了三十多年的女船工梅老二，以其一等功臣的英雄气概亲身掌舵，一夜间渡了五次。青年船工陆小牛手上负了伤，依然顽强地下水推船。当载送突击部队的船工们从南岸放空北驶时，在江心正碰上二梯队的船只蜂涌而来。他们在炮火声中互相鼓励着说：“加油啊，咱们的队伍打过去啦！”双方都撑足风帆，南北飞驶。不到五个钟头，解放军某部就全部到达对岸。
