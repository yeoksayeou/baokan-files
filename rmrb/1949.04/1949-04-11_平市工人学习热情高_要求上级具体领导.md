　　Workers in Ping City Show Great Enthusiasm for Learning;
  　Request Concrete Leadership from Higher Authorities
    [Our Newspaper News] Workers in public and private factories, as well as rickshaw pullers, etc., in Beiping City are eagerly requesting strengthened leadership in their studies. At present, their enthusiasm for learning is generally very high. Some have already organized themselves to study, some are actively learning on their own, and some are in the process of planning. Workers in the outer third district are studying literacy textbooks published by Xinhua Bookstore. In the inner second district, over 1,100 rickshaw pullers are generally reading newspapers and learning songs. Among them, a dozen female workers, despite only studying for a short time, are already able to write more than ninety characters. They even bought their own paper and pens. Workers are generally most interested in various policies, the resolutions of the Sixth National Labor Congress, political common sense, current events, culture, and technology. However, with the exception of large factories, they generally have not received more concrete leadership and assistance. For example, in the outer second district, more than 200 workers and shop assistants are studying on their own, burying themselves in books, because the leadership has not grasped the importance of leading their studies. The problem in the inner fourth district is also that the workers have risen up, but no one is leading them. In addition, the lack of and inappropriateness of teaching materials is also a major problem. They are currently only able to learn by thinking of topics or selecting materials from newspapers without a plan, and some of the materials are incomprehensible to the workers. Therefore, union members in various districts are universally requesting that the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions can regularly go deep into the districts to provide concrete assistance and give timely instructions.

　　平市工人学习热情高
  　要求上级具体领导
    【本报讯】北平市各区公私营工厂工人与三轮车夫等，急切地要求加强对他们学习的领导。现在他们学习热情一般很高，有的已经组织起来进行学习，有的在自己积极学习，有的在酝酿着。外三区工人们学习着新华书店出版的识字课本，内二区一千一百多三轮车夫普遍读报纸，学歌子。其中十几个女工学习时间并不久，有的已能写九十多个字。她们并自己买了纸笔。工人们一般最感兴趣的是各种政策、六次劳大决议案、政治常识、时事、文化及技术。但除大工厂外，一般尚未得到更具体的领导与帮助。如外二区有二百多工人、店员因为领导上没有抓紧领导他们学习，便自己买上书在那里闷住头看。内四区的问题，也是工人起来了，而没有人去领导。此外，教材的缺乏和不适当也是个大问题。他们现在仅能无计划地想些题目或在报纸上选择些材料来学，而有些材料又是工人看不懂的。所以各区职工普遍要求市总工会能经常深入到区具体帮助，及时给予指示。
