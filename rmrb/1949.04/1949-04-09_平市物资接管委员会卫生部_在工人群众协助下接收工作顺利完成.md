The Ping Municipality Materials Acquisition Committee's Health Department, Assisted by the Worker Masses, Successfully Completes Acquisition Work

[Our Newspaper's Report] The acquisition work of the Health Department of the Beiping Military Control Commission's Materials Acquisition Committee has come to a conclusion. The personnel received this time include 214 staff members and students from the General Health Department, the North China Bethune Medical University and its affiliated Veterinary Hospital, as well as some students who came to the liberated areas from Beiping. A total of 79 units, including medical institutions and drug warehouses of the pseudo-United Logistics System, national and provincial institutions and schools, and municipal systems, were taken over.

Before the acquisition, they extensively studied urban policies, entry discipline, and current affairs. Starting from December 23rd of last year, they began to take over 14 health and pharmaceutical institutions and warehouses in Mentougou, Fengtai, Tongxian, and other places. On February 8th, a comprehensive acquisition work was launched after entering the city. They adopted the following steps based on the specific situation to carry out the acquisition: (1) First, investigate each of the originally planned acquisition targets. Some of the institutions no longer existed, and some new ones were discovered, such as the 10th and 11th Medical Prevention Teams and various rear hospitals. (2) Officially negotiate the acquisition with the "Joint Office's" letter of introduction. Inventory materials, documents, and archives according to the forms submitted by each unit, and understand the personnel. (3) Announce the Military Control Commission's acquisition order and officially take over. The military representative speaks to stabilize the working mood of the employees and calls for a thorough investigation and handover. (4) During the acquisition work, study in groups, using the "People's Daily Inaugural Editorial," "Do Not Disrupt the Original Enterprise Structure," and "Carry the Revolution Through to the End" as study documents, and call for the combination of study and work to achieve the purpose of transforming ideology and reviewing cadres in the work. In some institutions that are about to be dissolved, research and summarize the business as a reference for future work. (5) Listen to the opinions of underground party members and progressive masses, discover activists among the masses, unite them to deeply understand the hidden facts and hidden agents in the acquisition work. In terms of life, pay salaries or living expenses to stabilize the morale of employees. (6) Concentrate the personnel from small units that have been or are about to be closed, merge them into large units or transfer them to guest houses, strengthen their current affairs and political study, and wait for the assignment.

Summarizing the entire acquisition work, there are several experiences and lessons: (1) In the case of peaceful acquisition, without being destroyed by war, the acquisition work is complete and systematic. The help of underground party members, progressive workers and masses, and progressive intellectuals to the acquisition work is enormous. For example, the workers of the Fengtai Horseshoe Factory did not leave the factory during the war, making the factory complete and undamaged; Ji Guangbin and Zhao Tongpu of the Military Horse Epidemic Prevention Station, under the leadership of underground party member Zhang Zhao, prevented the epidemic prevention station and warehouse from moving south, preserving important materials. (2) The communist party members and cadres' hard work, simplicity, diligence, and prompt handling of affairs promoted the old personnel to change their work attitude, changed their understanding of the Communist Party, and corrected their procrastination and bureaucratic attitude. (3) Adhere to the system of requesting approval in advance for the use of materials. (4) Attach importance to the workers' policy, and gain the enthusiastic support of the workers. The workers have experienced that the Chinese Communist Party is their own party, and the People's Liberation Army is their own team. (5) Differentiate between the use of the original organizational structure and resolutely stop the administrative activities of the reactionary military and political organs. For scientific institutions that should continue to exist, under the supervision of military representatives and liaison officers, let the old personnel be responsible for leading the work, such as the Central Epidemic Prevention Office, the Medical Prevention Team, the Army General Hospital, and the First Midwifery School. For the administrative organs of the reactionary military and political power, resolutely order them to stop administrative activities, and the military representatives or liaison officers are responsible for handling all administrative affairs, such as the Military Medical Department of the Fifth Supply District and the Hebei Provincial Health Department.

　　平市物资接管委员会卫生部
  　在工人群众协助下接收工作顺利完成
    【本报讯】北平军管会物资接管委员会卫生部的接管工作，已经告一段落。此次接收人员中，包括总卫生部、华北白求恩医科大学及附属兽医院等处的工作人员、学员以及一部分从北平新到解放区的学生共二百一十四人。共接收伪联勤系统、国省立机关院校和市立系统的医疗机构、药品仓库共七十九个单位。
    接收前，他们就普遍展开了关于城市政策、入城纪律和时事的学习，从去年十二月廿三日起，开始接管门头沟、丰台、通县等地的十四个卫生医药机构和仓库。二月八日起，展开入城后的全面接管工作。他们是根据具体情况，采取这样的步骤来进行接管的：（一）先按照原定接管对象，逐一调查。其中有的机关已不存在，也有新发现的，如医防第十、十一大队、各后方医院等。（二）持“联办”的介绍信正式商洽接管。按照各单位所交的表册清点物资文件档案，了解人员。（三）宣布军管会接管命令，正式接管。由军事代表讲话，安定员工的工作情绪，号召彻底清查移交。（四）在接交工作中，分成小组学习，以“人民日报发刊词”、“不要打乱原来的企业机构”和“将革命进行到底”等为学习文件，并号召学习与工作结合，以达到在工作中改造思想，审查干部的目的。在一些将要解散的机关，则发动研究与总结业务，作为以后工作中的参考。（五）听取地下党员和进步群众的意见，发现群众中的积极分子，团结他们，以深入了解接管工作中的隐蔽事实及隐藏的特务分子。生活上则发给薪金或发给生活维持费，安定员工情绪。（六）集中已结束将结束小单位的人员，并入大单位或转入招待所，加强他们的时事和政治学习，听候编遣。
    总结整个接管工作，有几点经验教训：（一）在和平接管的情况下，没有遭到战争的破坏，接收工作完整而有系统。地下党员、进步工人群众和进步知识分子对接管工作的帮助是巨大的。如丰台蹄铁工厂的工人在战争中未离工厂，使该厂完整无损；军马防疫所的姬广斌、赵桐朴等受地下党员张昭同志领导，阻止了防疫所和仓库南迁，保存了重要的物资。（二）共产党员和干部们艰苦、朴素、勤劳、迅速及时办事的作风，推动了旧人员改变工作态度，改变了他们对共产党的认识，纠正了他们的拖拉官僚态度。（三）坚持动用物资必须事先请示批准的制度。（四）重视工人的政策，获得工人同志们的热烈支援，工人们都体验到中国共产党是自己的政党，解放军是自己的队伍。（五）有区别的放手使用原有组织机构与坚决停止反动军事政权行政机关的行政活动。对仍应继续存在的科学机关，在军事代表、联络员监督之下，放手由旧人员负责领导工作，如中央防疫处、医防大队、陆军总医院、第一助产学校等。对反动军事政权行政机关，则断然命令其停止行政活动，由军事代表或联络员负责处理一切行政事务，如第五补给区军医处、河北省卫生处等。
