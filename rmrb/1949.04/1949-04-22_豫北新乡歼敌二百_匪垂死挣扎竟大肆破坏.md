【Taihang Electric】A certain unit of the People's Liberation Army in northern Henan severely damaged the 40th Army of Chiang Kai-shek bandits who ventured out to loot grain near Xinxiang. On April 13th, the bandit’s 1st Security Brigade fled to Zhaomu Village, where it was fiercely attacked by our unit, and the enemy fled in a disarray. We immediately took advantage of the victory to press the enemy to the Huangcun area with all our strength, launching a fierce assault and victoriously concluding the battle. A total of 210 enemy soldiers, including the deputy regimental commander of the 316th Regiment and platoon leaders, were captured alive, and more than 30 enemy soldiers, including a battalion commander, were killed or wounded.

【Taihang Electric】The remnant bandits entrenched in Xinxiang are engaging in extensive destruction of important constructions and materials within the city of Xinxiang. For example, 2,000 barrels of gasoline stored in the warehouse are being forcibly assigned by the enemy to each bao (unit of organization, roughly a village), two barrels per bao, sold for 100 silver yuan. All the sleepers of the Pinghan-Daoqing Railway tracks, which stretch 60 kilometers north and south of the city, have been dismantled. The raw iron, gasoline, and machine parts stored in the rolling stock section's warehouse, as well as the machine tool room, have all been destroyed and sold. The only five remaining locomotives have also had their boilers completely destroyed, and not a single car body is intact. The electric light plant has begun to be dismantled, with the bricks and tiles being auctioned off. This desperate and dying act of madness by the enemy has aroused the seething hatred of workers and citizens in the city, who have flocked outside the city to accuse the bandits to our government and the People's Liberation Army, demanding the swift liberation of Xinxiang and the punishment of the bandit leaders and war criminals.

　　豫北新乡歼敌二百
  　匪垂死挣扎竟大肆破坏
    【太行电】豫北人民解放军某部，于新乡近郊重创出犯抢粮之蒋匪四十军。四月十三日匪保一旅窜昭牧村，当遭我某部猛击，敌狼狈回逃。我即乘胜全力将该敌压至荒村一带，向敌猛烈冲击，胜利结束战斗。计生俘敌三一六团团副及连排长以下二百一十人，毙伤敌营长以下三十余人。
    【太行电】龟守新乡残匪竟大肆破坏新乡城内重要建设及物资。如该入库存之汽油两千桶，敌正向各保强派，每保两桶，卖银洋一百元，城郊南北共长六十公里之平汉道清路轨之道木，均被悉数拆除。机务段库存之生铁、汽油及工具房所存之机车配件全被毁卖，仅剩之五个机车也先后将锅炉破坏殆尽，车皮更无一完整。电灯房已开始拆毁，拍卖砖瓦。敌此种绝望垂死的疯狂兽行，已引起城内工人市民之切齿愤恨，纷至城外向我政府及人民解放军控诉，要求迅速解放新乡，惩处匪首战犯。
