　　　　Trade Unions in New Democratic Countries
    By B. Voda Berksha, Translated by Yang Huilin

    　　　　Trade Unions and People's Fronts

    The People's (National, Fatherland) Front, formed under the leadership of the Communist Party, is a broad union of democratic forces that fought for the liberation of countries enslaved by fascism and for the creation and strengthening of people's democratic states led by the working class. Within the People's Front, the Communist Party waged a sharp struggle against reactionaries who sought to halt its activities and distort its aims and tasks from within the front.

    The existence of parties and organizations representing the broad semi-proletariat and petty-bourgeois strata within the People's Front makes it easier for the working class to implement its role, spread its influence among the masses, and lead them.

    On the other hand, this requires it to constantly combat the vacillations of the petty bourgeoisie and the conspiracies of reaction. More determined struggles are needed before the resolutions of the People's Front can be realized. But not all members of the People's Front can carry out this struggle with the same enthusiasm. Therefore, the vanguard of the working class—the Communist and Workers' Parties—must remember that among all the organizations of the People's Front, the trade unions are its main support. Trade unions are best able to resolutely support its policies, maintain contact with the proletariat, and through the trade unions, connect with the entire working people.

    Lenin and Stalin repeatedly emphasized the great role of trade unions in building a new society. For example, Lenin said that "without the supreme leadership of the class," the transition from capitalism to socialism is impossible. And this class is "the only class educated by large-scale capitalist production, and at the same time, the only class whose interests are completely separate from those of the small property owners."

    Even though new democratic countries have their own specific development conditions, Lenin and Stalin's argument that trade unions are the main and direct support of the vanguard of the working class can still be fully applied to these countries.

    　　　　Distortion of the Role of Trade Unions by Yugoslav Communist Leaders

    The Tito, Kardelj, Djilas, Ranković group, which adopted an anti-Marxist line, viewed the peasantry as the leading force in the country. They dissolved the Communist Party into the People's Front and completely distorted the role of trade unions.

    The Yugoslav trade unions were artificially separated from the Party. They were regarded as a "bridge" connecting industrial workers, office staff, and the complex People's Front, rather than a "bridge" connecting with the Party. According to the Yugoslav Party authorities, trade unions are not the Party's main supporters. These traitors to the proletariat even denied the need for trade unions as independent organizations of the proletariat. For example, Djilas declared in January 1947 that it was meaningless and wrong for trade unions and other organizations of the People's Front to hold separate meetings. These meetings should be held together at the same time.

    The leaders of the Yugoslav Communist Party believed that the organs of state power—the People's Committees—were the Party's main supporters, and gave them the position of trade unions and the proletariat. This rebellious group used the "special" nature of the Yugoslav liberation struggle to justify this, arguing that trade unions, i.e., the working class, did not play a role in this struggle. For example, this "theory" was propagated by Moša Pijade in an article on the structure of state power in Yugoslavia. ("Borba" magazine, June 12, 1948.)

    The Tito group deprived the working class of its leading role in the People's Committees, elevated the peasantry to become the leading force in the country, and demoted the trade unions, thus relegating the entire working class to the background of the country's political life. Denying the leading role of the working class is part of the anti-Marxist errors of the Yugoslav Party leaders, which is leading Yugoslavia to degenerate into a bourgeois state.

    　　　　Party Work in Trade Unions

    The Cominform's resolution on the situation of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia stated that the transition from capitalism to socialism in new democratic countries is carried out along with sharp class struggle. Therefore, while strengthening the leading role of the Communist and Workers' Parties among the masses, it is also necessary to further strengthen the trade unions with greater attention.

    The large increase in members of the Communist and Workers' Parties must ensure that the Party organizations do not lose their ability to become the leaders and educators of the working people, and must ensure that the Party neither merges with the trade unions in terms of the level and nature of work, nor replaces them.

    Considering that trade unions are broad organizations of the working people, the Party should adopt some working methods and approaches to gain the support of the members and, through them, raise the political level of the entire working class. There are still some trade union leaders in some new democratic countries who want to use unacceptable working methods, want to become bureaucrats, and want to issue orders.

    At the Second Congress of Bulgarian Trade Unions last February, Comrade Dimitrov said: The responsibility of trade unions is to develop true democracy, to rely on the enterprising spirit of the workers, to strengthen conscious discipline, and to respect freedom of opinion. Dimitrov said: "There are no nobles or rulers in the working class. The working class requires its leaders to have talent, character, determination, and tact in their contacts with the workers. We can only lament those leaders who do not understand these things."

    Communists in trade unions should ensure that democratic principles and methods are implemented in all trade union work.

    Criticism and self-criticism are being carried out on an unprecedentedly wide scale in the trade unions of new democratic countries. Most importantly, this criticism has begun to be carried out not only from top to bottom, but also from bottom to top. This will expose errors and shortcomings more quickly and thoroughly, expose bureaucrats and enemies, and realize mass supervision from bottom to top.

    Communists must always be vigilant so that all reactionary conspiracies can be crushed in their initial stages. They should expose saboteurs, malingerers, and spies, carefully protect enterprises, prevent any provocateurs and enemies from infiltrating trade union organizations, and constantly raise the class vigilance of trade union members.

    It is necessary to constantly remember that the growing resistance carried out by the exploiting classes and strata, which are supported by imperialism and are increasingly declining, still exists.

    Party organizations should educate their members to stand at the forefront of the working people in the struggle for higher labor productivity, to become leaders in labor competitions—such an important factor in increasing production—to improve the people's living standards. Only in this environment can the Communist Party maintain and develop its leading role among the masses of trade union members.

    Party organizations are responsible for the work of trade unions. Communist and Workers' Parties should regard the development of the trade union movement as one of the most important and current issues in their work. The strengthening of trade unions and their work will help mobilize the working people to complete the current tasks, raise their fighting spirit, and enhance the leading role of the working class. This is one of the main guarantees of achieving socialist victory in new democratic countries.

### 新民主主义国家的职工会

　　新民主主义国家的职工会
    Ｂ·伏达·伯克沙作  杨慧琳译
    　　　　职工会和人民阵线
    人民的（国民的，祖国的）阵线，已在共产党领导下形成民主力量的广大的团结，为被法西斯主义奴役的国家的解放，为创设和加强工人阶级领导的人民的民主国家而战斗。在人民阵线中，共产党对反动派进行了尖锐的斗争。这些反动派试图在阵线内部制止其活动并歪曲其目的和任务。
    人民阵线里代表广大半无产者与小资产阶层的党派与组织的存在，使得工人阶级更容易贯彻它的作用，使它能在群众中散播它的影响，并且领导他们。
    另方面这使它必须向小资产阶级的动摇性和反动的阴谋进行不断的斗争。在人民阵线的决议能够实现以前，还必需更坚决的斗争。但并不是人民阵线的所有成员都能以同样的热烈来进行这斗争的。因此工人阶级的先锋队——共产党和工人党——必须记住人民阵线的所有组织中，职工会是它主要的支持者。职工会最能坚决地拥护它的政策，并和无产阶级保持联系，以及通过职工会和整个劳动人民连系。
    列宁和斯大林曾一再强调在建设新社会中职工会的伟大作用。例如列宁说过“没有阶级的最高领导”，从资本主义过渡到社会主义是不可能的。而这一阶级是“为资本主义大规模生产所唯一教育了的阶级，同时也是唯一和小有产者的利益绝缘的阶级。”
    纵使在新民主主义国家有其特殊的发展条件，列宁斯大林关于职工会是工人阶级先锋队主要与直接的支持者的论点，还是能全部应用到这些国家的。
    　　　　南斯拉夫共产党领导者对职工会作用的歪曲
    采取着反马克斯主义路线的铁托、卡尔笛奇、狄益拉斯、南柯维克集团，把农民看成国内的领导力量。他们把共产党溶化到人民阵线里去了，并且完全歪曲了职工会的作用。
    南斯拉夫的职工会被人工地和党隔离开了。它们被当作连系产业工人、机关职员和成份复杂的人民阵线的“桥梁”，而不是和党连系的“桥梁”。根据南斯拉夫党的当权者说，职工会并不是党的主要支持者。这些无产阶级的叛徒竟然否认作为无产阶级独立组织的职工会之需要了。例如狄益拉斯在一九四七年正月宣称职工会和人民阵线各组织分开开会是无意义的和错误的。这些会应同时在一起开。
    南斯拉夫共产党领导人认为国家权力的机关——人民委员会——是党的主要支持者，并把职工会和无产阶级的地位给了它们。这个叛逆集团用南斯拉夫解放斗争的“特殊”性来解辩，并且认为职工会，即工人阶级，在这个斗争中并不起作用。例如这个“理论”在毛斯·皮耶德在南斯拉夫国家权力的结构一文上就曾传播过。（“波尔巴”杂志，一九四八年六月十二日。）
    铁托集团剥夺了工人阶级对人民委员会的领导作用，而把农民提升成为国家的领导力量，黜退了职工会因此也就把整个工人阶级黜退到国家政治生活的后面去了。否认工人阶级的领导作用，是南斯拉夫党领导者们反马克斯主义错误的一部分，它正在导使南斯拉夫堕落成为资产阶级的国家。
    　　　　职工会中党的工作
    情报局对南斯拉夫共产党的形势的决议说，在新民主主义国家从资本主义过渡到社会主义是与尖锐的阶级斗争一起进行的。因此，与共产党和工人党在群众中的领导作用加强的同时，也需要以更大的注意来更进一步的加强职工会。
    共产党和工人党党员的大量增加就必须保证党的组织不要失掉成为劳动人民的领导者和教育者的能力，必需保证党既不是在工作的水平和性质上和职工会溶合为一，也不是取而代之。
    考虑到职工会是劳动人民的广大组织，党应该采取一些工作的方式方法来取得会员群众的拥护，并且经过他们可以提高整个工人阶级的政治水平。有的新民主主义国家还有某些职工会的领袖，还是想使用不可容许的工作方法，想成为官僚主义以及想发号施令。
    在保加利亚职工会去年二月第二次代表大会上，季米特洛夫同志说：职工会的责任是去发展真正的民主，去依靠职工们的进取精神，去加强自觉的纪律，去遵守意见的自由。季米特洛夫说：“在工人阶级中没有贵族和统治者。工人阶级要求它的领导者们在和职工的联系上有才智、品性、决断和机敏。对不懂得这些的领导者们，我们只有悲叹。”
    职工会中的共产党员，应该保证在职工会所有工作中实行民主的原则与方式。
    批评和自我批评在新民主主义国家的职工会中，已在空前广泛地展开着。最重要的是这种批评已开始不但从上到下，而且从下到上的在进行着。这样将会更快更彻底的暴露错误和缺点，暴露官僚主义者和敌人，并且实现从下到上的群众监督。
    共产党员必需常常警觉，使得一切反动阴谋可以在最初的阶段就被粉碎。他们应该揭发破坏分子、怠工者和间谍，应细心的保卫企业，防止任何挑拨者和敌人混入职工会组织，不断提高职工会会员们的阶级警惕性。
    需要经常记住，为帝国主义支持而日趋没落的剥削阶层与阶级所进行的增涨着的反抗还是存在的。
    党的组织应该教育他们的党员，在为更高的劳动生产率而斗争的劳动人民中站在最前面，成为劳动竞赛——增加生产上如此重要的因素——的带头人，来改进人民的生活水准。只有在这种环境下，共产党才能在职工会会员群众中维持和发展它的领导作用。
    党的组织要对职工会的工作负责。共产党和工人党应把职工运动的发展看成他们工作中最重要和最当前的问题之一。职工会和其工作的加强，将会帮助动员劳动人民来完成当前的任务，提高他们的战斗情绪和增强工人阶级的领导作用。这是在新民主主义国家中取得社会主义胜利的主要保证之一。
