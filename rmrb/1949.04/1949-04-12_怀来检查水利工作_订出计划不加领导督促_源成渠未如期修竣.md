　　Huailai Inspects Water Conservancy Work
  　Plans Drawn Up Without Leadership Supervision
  　Yuancheng Canal Not Completed as Scheduled
    [Chahar News] The Huailai County Government recently dispatched cadres to inspect the county's water conservancy development and found that the Yuancheng Canal restoration plan had not been completed on schedule. The canal was originally scheduled to begin construction on February 1st and be completed on March 23rd, but progress has been very slow in the half-month since construction began. The main reasons for the inspection are: 1. The county leadership did not pay close attention to it, thinking that there would be no problem after the plan was made, and did not send anyone to personally lead and supervise such a large project. 2. There was insufficient understanding and estimation of all aspects of the canal, and the plan was not thorough, resulting in failure to complete it on schedule. For example, the original plan was to have 200 to 300 workers per day, but the problem of the river thawing was not taken into account. During the project, the Yongding River quickly thawed, preventing workers on the west bank from crossing the river, which greatly reduced the number of canal builders. 3. The wages were too low, only three liters of rice per person per day, and no meals were provided regardless of the heavy work, so many workers were unwilling to repair the canal. Currently, only fifty or sixty people and nine carts are working each day, accomplishing very little. After identifying these shortcomings, the county government decided to send a special person to personally take charge of the restoration project at the canal, specifically helping the canal's water conservancy committee to study methods and accelerate completion.

　　怀来检查水利工作
  　订出计划不加领导督促
  　源成渠未如期修竣
    【察哈尔讯】怀来县政府日前派遣干部检查全县水利兴办情形，发现源成渠的修复计划，未能按期完成。该渠原决定二月一日动工，三月二十三日修竣，但开工半月来成绩很小。检查原因主要是：一、县里领导抓得不紧，以为订了计划就没问题了，对于这样大的工程并未派人亲自领导督促。二、对水渠的各方情况了解估计不够，计划不周密，致不能如期完工。如原计划每日出人工二百到三百，但没估计到河水解冻问题。在工程进行中永定河很快解了冻，致河西人工未能过河，使修渠人数大减。三、工资订的太低，每日每人三升米，活重也不管饭，很多工人不愿来修渠。现每日上工的只有五六十人和九辆车，每天工作很少。检查出这些缺点后，县府决定派专人赴该渠亲自掌握修复工程，具体帮助该渠水利委员会研究办法，加紧完成。　　　　　　　　（金仓）
