　　How to Select Seeds?
    Recently, in many areas, crops often suffer from diseases, such as yellow dwarf disease in wheat and glume blight and white core disease in millet. In severely affected areas, diseases can reach over 40 percent, seriously impacting crop development and yield increase. Therefore, attention must be paid to seed selection. As people often say, "A strong mother yields fat offspring." With good seeds, diseases can hopefully be reduced.
    Seed selection methods: 1. Water selection, which involves pouring cold water into a basin, then pouring the selected seeds in and stirring. This will float the chaff or a few diseased grains, leaving the full grains to be dried for seeds. 2. Wind selection, which uses a winnowing fan or basket to blow away the chaff, leaving the full grains for seeds. 3. Sieve selection, which uses a sieve to sift the selected seeds once, sifting out the chaff and small seeds, leaving the fat and large ones for seeds.
    The second step is to conduct a germination test, which involves counting one hundred seeds of a crop, wetting them with water, placing them on a plate, covering them with a white cloth, and maintaining constant humidity. After germination, count the number of sprouted seeds. If germination reaches above eighty, it is considered a good seed. If it is above seventy, the planting quantity should be increased accordingly, otherwise the seedlings will not emerge evenly. If it is below seventy, seeds must be exchanged.
    The third step is to perform warm water soaking, which involves mixing two parts boiling water with one part cold water to ensure even temperature. Then, take one part seeds (same amount as the cold water) and pour them in, stirring with a stick, soaking for the time it takes to smoke one or two cigarettes, then捞 them out and cool them before planting. However, the ratio of seeds to water, boiling water to cold water, must be accurate during soaking.　　　　　(Taihang Second District Agricultural and Forestry Group)

　　怎样选种？
    近来来不少地区，庄稼常发生病害，如麦子的黄疸病，谷子的糠谷老和露心病等。发展严重的地区，病害达百分之四十以上，严重影响作物的发育与增产，为此必须注意选种，人常说：“母壮子肥”，有了好种籽病害可望减少。
    选种办法：１、水选，就是把凉水倒在盆内然后将选下种籽倒进搅搅，就可将秕的或少数病粒漂起，饱满的晒干作种籽。２、风选，是在扇车和簸箕将秕的扇去，留下饱满的作种。３节选，是用筛子把选好的种籽筛一次，将秕的小的筛下，留下肥的大的作种。
    第二步工作要作发芽试验，就是把一种作物的种籽数上一百粒，用水浸湿，放在盘子里，用一块白布盖住，保持经常湿度，出芽后数一数发芽数量，如发芽到八十以上，就是好种籽。如在七十粒以上，种时就要增加一定数量，否则苗子出不齐，如在七十粒以下，即须调种。
    第三步要作温汤浸种，其办法是用两份开水一份凉水对起来使温度均匀，再拿一份种籽（和凉水一样多）倒进去，用棍搅搅，泡上吸一袋烟或二袋烟时间，即可捞出来，凉干再下种，但在浸种时种籽和水，开水和凉水的比例数量，一定要准确。　　　　　（太行二专农林组）
