　　The Troops March South
    Lü Jian
    The troops, the troops march south,
    Waves of red flags flash and gleam;
    The troops, the troops march south,
    The boundless plains are covered with people.

　　Brass bugles with red tassels,
    Da-da-da di-di-di, marching forward;
    The commander and officers ride big horses,
    Leading the troops on their departure.

　　Like a dragon soaring through the air, a gust of wind,
    You can't see the head, you can't see the tail,
    The steel battalion marches in the front,
    Followed closely by the ever-victorious company.

　　Living like a little tiger in the mountains,
    A heroic bearing, truly mighty;
    Red flowers and green leaves adorn their chests,
    Submachine guns and hand grenades.

　　Yellow dust rises, rolling and swirling,
    Car horns blare, shouting and shouting,
    The heavy artillery brigade marches in the front,
    Followed by the tank regiment.

　　Then there are the light cavalry,
    Ten thousand dragons in a gust of wind,
    High mountains and flowing water rush and roar,
    The horses' hooves are busy on the march.

　　The wind sweeps the clouds, covering the sky,
    The crowds seeing them off stand by the villages;
    Uncles, sisters-in-law, and aunts,
    Look at their own troops with great affection:

　　"You, with your million troops, march forward,
    We, ten million people, will transport grain and grass;
    Ten million people will support you,
    Capture old Chiang to avenge our grievances!"

　　White cloth socks, blue cloth shoes,
    Green flowered towels and comfort bags,
    The children hold the soldiers' hands:
    "Uncle, uncle, please accept this!"

　　The front row roars with the song of Mao Zedong,
    The back row roars with the song of Commander-in-Chief Zhu;
    Patches of golden needles bloom all over the fields!
    Patches of kindness are remembered in our hearts.

　　"The great banner of Mao Zedong flutters in the wind,
    Glorious southward march, high in spirit,
    Yesterday, a thousand troops crossed the Yellow River,
    Today, we will cross the Yangtze River and destroy the bandit's lair!"

　　The Yellow River rolls on for ten thousand miles,
    The heroic troops march south,
    The Yangtze River is just a line,
    We will liberate the great Jiangnan with a whoosh.

　　The troops, the troops march south,
    The troops, the troops march forward,
    The front has already reached the southern horizon,
    The beginning is still unfolding on the northern horizon. ...

　　队伍向南开
    吕剑
    队伍队伍向南开，
    一阵阵红旗一阵阵闪；
    队伍队伍向南开，
    无边的平原人遮盖。
　
    黄铜的军号红穗穗，
    答答答笛笛笛向前进；
    司令员指挥员骑大马，
    带领着队伍在出发。
　
    龙腾半空一阵风，
    望不见头来望不见尾，
    前面走的钢铁营，
    常胜连队紧相随。
　
    活象那山中小老虎，
    英雄的气派真威武；
    红花绿叶配胸前，
    机关短枪手榴弹。
　
    黄土腾空卷又卷，
    汽车的喇叭喊又喊，
    重炮大队前边走，
    后边跟的坦克团。
　
    再就数着轻骑兵，
    千万条游龙一阵风，
    高山流水哗啦啦响，
    前征的路上马蹄忙。
　
    风刮云彩遮满天，
    欢送的人群站村边；
    大爷二嫂三婶子，
    看着自己的队伍好喜欢：
　
    “你百万人马前边走，
    俺千万人民运粮草；
    千万的人民支援你，
    捉住老蒋报仇冤！”
　
    白布袜子青布鞋，
    绿花毛巾和慰问袋，
    娃娃们拉住战士的手：
    “叔叔叔叔你把它收”！
　
    排头轰隆隆唱起了毛泽东，
    后头轰隆隆唱起朱总司令；
    一片片金针开满畦！
    一片片恩情记心里。
　
    “毛泽东大旗顺风飘，
    光荣南下志气高，
    昨天千军万马过黄河，
    今天就横渡长江捣贼窝！”
　
    黄河滚滚万里流，
    英雄队伍朝南走，
    长江不过是一条线，
    撒拉拉解放大江南。
　
    队伍队伍向南开，
    队伍队伍向前开，
    前阵已经到了南天边，
    从头在北天边上才摆开。……
