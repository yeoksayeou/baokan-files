Editor:
    I have a question to ask: The Jinzhong Military Region Administrative Office's Tax Department Announcement No. 1 regarding taxation states in Article 1: Slaughter tax - 50 yuan per sheep, 100 yuan per pig, and 300 yuan per cow. Is this in line with the principle of developing production? Also, should a tax be levied on the slaughter of donkeys?

Comrade Gong Shouli:

The North China People's Government levies taxes on the slaughter of livestock, referring to old, weak, and disabled livestock incapable of plowing or transportation, in addition to pigs and sheep. The slaughter of cattle, donkeys, mules, horses, etc., must be inspected and stamped by the tax authorities, and taxed according to the tax rate before slaughtering. This is because our region currently has a limited number of livestock. In order to develop agricultural production and transportation, we encourage breeding and prohibit arbitrary slaughter (ewes cannot be slaughtered casually either). Regarding the donkeys and mules you mentioned, if they meet the above conditions and have been inspected and certified by the tax bureau, they can be slaughtered after paying taxes. The tax rate is as follows:

The livestock slaughter tax rate is 5% of the meat price. Those who slaughter for their own consumption are exempt from tax after being certified by the tax bureau or village office. Those who use some for themselves and sell some are taxed on the sold portion based on its price.

For the convenience of collection, the aforementioned slaughter tax may be levied by quantity (per head) according to the tax rate when necessary, and the tax amount shall be determined by the Administrative Office (City) Tax Bureau. The tax rate set by Jinzhong is levied by quantity (calculated per head), which is consistent with the original tax regulations. If a donkey is disabled and slaughtered after inspection and approval by the tax bureau, the same tax will be levied.

### 屠宰税是如何规定的

专栏：询问答复

　　屠宰税是如何规定的编辑同志：
    今有一个问题，请解答：晋中军区行政公署税行字第一号的布告关于征税问题第一条：屠宰税——羊每头五十元，猪每头一百元，牛每头三百元。这样是否合乎发展生产的原则？此外，杀驴是否亦应征税？
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　五台一区巩守礼巩守礼同志：
    华北人民政府对屠杀牲畜征税，除猪羊外，是指不能耕作运输的残废老弱的牲口。凡杀牛、驴、骡、马等，须经税务机关验明，并盖有验讫戳记，按税率征税后，方能屠宰。这因为我区目前牲口较少，为了发展农业生产和运输事业，奖励繁殖，禁止随便屠杀（母羊也不能随便杀）。你所谈的驴骡，如果合乎上列条件，并经税局查验证明交税后，方能屠宰。税率依规定每头纳税率如左：
    牲畜屠宰税税率，按肉价百分之五征收。自杀自用者，经税局所或村公所证明后免税。自用一部出售一部者，按出售部分从价征收。
    前项屠宰税为征收便利必要时得按税率规定从量（按头）征收，税额由行署区（市）税务局决定。晋中所定的税率就是从量征收（按头计算），与原税则规定一致。杀驴的如是残废，经税局查验核准后屠宰，一样征收。
