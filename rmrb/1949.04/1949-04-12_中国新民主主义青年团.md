　　The China New Democratic Youth League, upon the convening of its first National Congress, has already become a powerful youth contingent welcomed by the broad masses of young people in China. Its membership has reached 190,000.

　　Since the Chinese Communist Party proposed experimental organization building in October 1946, the Youth League has been successively established in various regions over the past two and a half years, playing a significant role in the work of various departments under the leadership of the Party and the government, proving the possibility and necessity of building the League. On January 1st of this year, the CPC Central Committee issued the historically significant "Resolution on Establishing the China New Democratic Youth League" for Chinese youth, calling for the widespread establishment of the League nationwide and stipulating that the basic task of the Youth League is to educate members and young people in the spirit of Marxism-Leninism through revolutionary practice, while organizing the broad masses of young people to actively participate in various movements called for by the Party and the People's Government. Subsequently, the National Youth League Preparatory Committee, led by Comrade Ren Bishi, was established in February. Since then, the Youth League has experienced even greater development. As of now, according to preliminary and incomplete statistics, the number of League members in various regions is as follows: North China has a total of 40,000 members, Northeast has 38,000, East China has 79,000, Northwest has 21,000, the central region is a new area and the establishment of the league has only recently begun, with about 600 members, and the Inner Mongolia Youth League has about 11,000 members. Major cities in the liberated areas, including newly liberated cities such as Beiping, Tianjin, Shenyang, Jinan, Zhengzhou, Luoyang, and Kaifeng, have rapidly established League organizations. The composition of League members is mainly young workers, young farmers, and young revolutionary intellectuals.

　　For more than two years, thanks to the assistance of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, coupled with the efforts of the Youth League members, the Youth League has played a vanguard and core role in various tasks such as joining the army, supporting the front, production, and study, and a large number of outstanding League members and model deeds have emerged.

　　The Youth League is a leading force in joining the army, participating in the war, and supporting the front. In Dingxian, Pingshan, and other places in North China, League members were the first to sign up for the army. Shi Zhenyu, a female combat hero from Shandong who persisted in guerrilla warfare against the Kuomintang reactionaries for eighteen months and participated in ninety-two battles, and Lü Shunbao and Liu Sihu, famous combat heroes of the People's Liberation Army in North China and Northwest China, are all representatives attending the first National Congress of the Youth League. In the militia rotational combat camp supporting the Huaihai Campaign in the East China Liberated Area, forty-seven League members set an example by stabilizing the emotions of the laborers in an organized manner, and thirty of them were commended for their merits, and all of them joined the People's Liberation Army after returning home.

　　Youth League members at work first lead others with their exemplary actions in production, such as responding to competitions, improving quality and output, saving raw materials, and caring for and improving machinery. After the establishment of the Youth League in the No. 2 Paper Mill in Harbin, output increased by one-third. Two of the three model production teams in the No. 1 Leather Shoe Factory in Northeast China are led by League members.

　　Five of the nine workers on the "Iron Ox" locomotive of the Northeast Railway Bureau, which broke the driving record by running 106,000 kilometers, are League members. In the production competition of the Daxing Cotton Mill in Shijiazhuang, the red flag is often placed on the machines used by the Youth League members. The Youth League also actively promotes young workers to study culture, politics, and technology. Youth Leagues in various places have established youth worker lectures, technical symposiums, training classes, speech contests, blackboard newspapers, reading groups, communication groups, etc. to help young workers acquire various knowledge. The Youth League in many factories in Northeast China proposed respecting teachers and loving apprentices, and actively uniting veteran workers to promote veteran workers to enthusiastically and actively cultivate young workers. Youth League members also unite workers to engage in various cultural and recreational activities, restore workers' fatigue and improve production morale. They take care of sick workers, organize support for the army and preferential treatment for military families, help cooperatives transport grain, clean up dormitories... Due to the exemplary performance of Youth League members in all aspects, some administrative leaders of state-owned factories who originally doubted the role of the League in the factory later became active advocates of building the League in the factory. The Youth League in private factories also unites workers to protect their legitimate rights, such as the Youth League of the Iron Factory in Harbin City, which won the struggle against the factory owner's beating of young workers and prohibiting workers from participating in political activities.

　　League members strive to study hard in schools and sincerely help others. All eleven model students elected by the whole school of Harbin No. 4 Middle School are League members, and the total score of League members in the school's coursework and conduct is mostly above 80 points. League members in various places not only have good grades, but also help student unions organize various extracurricular activities centered on the curriculum. Because the Youth League has demonstrated a positive role in ensuring the completion of teaching plans, many school administrative officials and teachers rely on the Youth League to carry out various tasks. In addition, students in Jilin actively care for wounded soldiers in hospitals, wash bloody clothes, and rush to sign up for blood transfusions. More than 300 students in Harbin organized a summer labor construction team to build roads. These activities were carried out with League members as the backbone. In many newly liberated cities such as Beiping, Tianjin, Zhengzhou, and Luoyang, the newly established Youth League in major universities and middle schools united students to transform their thinking and promote the implementation of the New Democratic education policy. League members in Pingjin also responded to the call of the People's Liberation Army and actively participated in the southward work group. The life of the Youth League in factories and schools is very lively. For example, the Youth League in Northeast China established a "League Day" system, which is held once a week or every two weeks. The content includes speech contests, special reports, holding ceremonies for new League members, introducing model deeds of League members, giving League lessons, teaching songs, telling stories, entertainment evenings, and arranging current work tasks. The content is determined at any time according to the requirements of League members and current tasks. League members find it very interesting and it has played a great educational role.

　　The Youth League in rural areas was established in many cases during the land reform, promoting young people inside and outside the League and the peasant masses to participate in the anti-feudal struggle. Due to the courage and frankness of the young people, they often stand at the forefront of the struggle. They are also often the initiators or earliest participants in rural labor mutual aid. According to a survey of 100 League branches in Dingxian, 2, 3, or 4 mutual aid groups were formed under the leadership of League members based on the principle of voluntary mutual benefit, including 1,021 households. Youth labor exchange teams in Zizhou County and Wubu County, Shaanxi Province, often help military families with farming. In learning, the Youth League also shows autonomy and initiative. Jin Gou Gong Zhuang in Junan, Shandong Province, previously had only two people who knew how to keep accounts and twelve people who were barely literate. After League member Ji Pifu organized learning, 52 people in the entire village could recognize two or three thousand characters. The Youth League also guided rural youth to correct bad habits such as gambling, fighting, and visiting neighbors, which were stained from the old society, and was praised by parents.

　　The Youth League promotes young employees in government departments and work agencies to work actively and study hard, which significantly improves work efficiency.

　　The Youth League has proven and will continue to prove that it is the reserve force of the Chinese Communist Party. A large number of outstanding League members have joined the Chinese Communist Party. Many League members hope to quickly improve their political consciousness within the League so that they can be absorbed into the Party.

　　The "China Youth" magazine, published according to the CPC Central Committee's resolution on building the League, is welcomed by the broad masses, and its current circulation has reached more than 90,000 copies. In other places, only the three regions of Northeast, Central Plains, and Jin-Sui have a total of more than 20 kinds of publications and supplements published by the Youth League, with a total circulation of about 65,000 copies per issue. New Democratic Youth League schools and League schools and training classes in various places are training a large number of young cadres. The Youth Theater has also been established. Its task is to study and guide the cultural entertainment and artistic propaganda work of Youth Leagues at all levels, and to train young art cadres.

　　Because the Chinese revolution is about to achieve victory throughout the country, and the task of building a New Democratic New China is becoming increasingly important, Chinese youth are also more urgently in need of the Youth League to lead and educate them. The first National Congress of the Youth League will discuss the Youth League's work program, tasks, and work, pass the formal League Constitution, and elect the Central Committee. The New Democratic Youth League, this mass organization of advanced Chinese youth, will become broader and stronger after the congress, and will advance the Chinese youth movement to a higher level.

　　中国新民主主义青年团
    新华社
    中国新民主主义青年团，在它召开第一次全国代表大会时，已经成为中国广大青年群众所欢迎的一支有力量的青年队伍了。它的团员已达到十九万人。
    自从一九四六年十月中国共产党提议试验建团后，两年半以来，青年团在各地陆续建立，并在党和政府领导的各部门工作中，起了重大的作用，证明了建团的可能和必要。今年一月一日，中共中央发布了对中国青年有历史意义的“关于建立中国新民主主义青年团的决议”，号召在全国普遍建团，规定了青年团的基本任务在于从革命实践中以马列主义精神教育团员和青年群众，同时组织广大青年群众积极参加党和人民政府所号召的各种运动。继之，由任弼时同志领导的全国青年团筹委会在二月间成立。在此以后，青年团就有了更大的发展。截至目前为止，各地团员数字根据初步不完全的统计，华北共有四万人，东北三万八千人，华东七万九千人，西北二万一千人，中原因是新区，建团开始不久，约有团员六百余人，内蒙古青年团约一万一千人。解放区各大城市，包括北平、天津、沈阳、济南、郑州、洛阳、开封等新解放的城市在内，都已迅速建立了团的组织。团员成份以青年工人、青年农民和青年革命知识分子为主体。
    两年多来，由于中国共产党和人民政府的帮助，加上青年团员的努力，在参军支前生产学习等各种工作中，青年团都起了先锋作用和核心作用，涌现了大量的优秀团员和模范事迹。
    青年团在参军、参战及支援前线方面是一支带头的力量。华北定县、平山等地，团员都首先报名参军。曾经坚持十八个月反对国民党反动派的游击战争，参加战斗九十二次的山东战斗女英雄侍振玉，华北和西北人民解放军著名的战斗英雄吕顺保和刘四虎，都是这次出席青年团第一次代表大会的代表。华东解放区支援淮海战役的民兵轮战营中，四十七个团员以身作则，有组织地安定民工情绪，其中三十名团员立了功，回家后全部参加了人民解放军。
    工作中的青年团员，首先以自己在生产上的模范行动带动别人，如响应竞赛，提高质量产量，节约原料，爱护和改良机器等。哈尔滨第二纸厂建团后，产量提高三分之一。东北皮鞋一厂三个模范生产队中两个是由团员担任队长的。
    东北铁路局打破行车记录运行十万六千公里的铁牛号机车的九个工友中，有五个是团员。石家庄大兴纱厂的生产竞赛中，红旗经常插在青年团团员所使用的机器上。青年团还积极推动青工来进行文化、政治和技术的学习。各地青年团建立了青工讲座，技术座谈会，训练班，演讲比赛，黑板报，读报组，通讯组等帮助青工获得各种知识。东北很多工厂的青年团提出尊师爱徒，主动团结老工友，推动老工友来热心积极地培养青年工人。青年团员还团结工人从事各种文娱活动，恢复工人疲劳提高了生产情绪，他们照顾生病工友，组织拥军优属，帮助合作社运粮，打扫宿舍………。由于青年团员在各方面的模范表现，使得有些原来怀疑团在工厂中作用的公营工厂行政领导者，后来也成为在工厂建团的积极倡导人了。在私营工厂里的青年团，还团结工人保障自己的正当权利，如哈尔滨市铁工厂的青年团，反对厂主殴打青工及禁止工人参加政治活动的斗争，得到了胜利。
    团员在学校里努力学习，并热诚帮助别人。哈尔滨第四中学全校选举出来的十一名模范学生都是团员，该校团员的课业与操行的总分数绝大多数在八十分以上。各地团员不但课程好，并帮助学生会组织各种以课程为中心的课外活动。由于青年团对于保证教学计划的完成上，表现了积极作用，因此许多学校行政负责人和教员，都依靠青年团来进行各种工作。此外吉林的学生，积极在病院看护伤兵，洗血衣，争先报名输血，哈市三百多学生组织暑期劳动建设队，修筑道路，这些都是以团员为骨干进行的。在许多刚被解放的城市中象北平、天津、郑州和洛阳，各主要大中学里新建立的青年团，团结了同学进行改造思想，推动实行新民主主义教育方针。平津的团员并响应了人民解放军的号召，踊跃参加了南下工作团。工厂和学校中青年团的生活，是很活泼的。如东北的青年团建立了“团日”制，每周或两周举行一次。内容有讲演竞赛，专题报告，举行新团员入团仪式，介绍团员模范事迹，讲团课、教歌、讲故事，游艺晚会及布置当前工作任务等，随时根据团员要求及当前任务来决定内容，团员都感到很有兴趣，并起了很大的教育作用。
    农村中的青年团，很多是在土地改革中建立起来，推动了团内外的青年和农民群众参加反封建斗争。由于青年们的勇敢和坦率，他们往往站在斗争最前线。他们也常是农村劳动互助的发起人或最先参加者。根据定县一百个团支部的调查，由团员的带动，在自愿两利的原则下组成了二三四个互助组，包括一零二一户。陕西子洲县、吴堡县的青年变工队，经常帮助军工属耕种。在学习上，青年团也显出自动性和积极性。山东莒南金沟宫庄以前只有两个人会记帐，十二个人粗通文字，经过团员纪丕福组织学习后，全村识上两三千字的就有五十二人。青年团并且引导农村青年改正了赌博、打架、串门子等从旧社会沾染来的坏习惯，受到家长们的赞扬。
    青年团在政府各部门工作机关里，推动青年职员积极工作和努力学习，使工作效率显著提高。
    青年团已经并将继续证明它是中国共产党的后备军。大量的优秀团员，参加了中国共产党。许多团员希望在团内迅速提高自己的政治觉悟，以便能被吸收入党。
    根据中共中央建团决议出版的“中国青年”杂志，受到广大群众的欢迎，目前发行额已达九万余份。其他各地仅东北、中原、晋绥三个地区统计，青年团出版的刊物和副刊即有二十余种，每期共发行约六万五千份。新民主主义青年团团校和各地的团校及训练班，正在训练着大批青年干部。青年剧院也已经建立，它的任务是研究与指导各级青年团的文化娱乐和艺术宣传工作，并培养青年艺术干部。
    由于中国革命即将在全国取得胜利，建设新民主主义新中国的任务日益重要，因此中国青年也更加迫切地需要青年团来领导教育他们，青年团的第一次全国代表大会，将讨论青年团的工作纲领、任务和工作，通过正式的团章，选举中央委员会。新民主主义青年团，这个中国先进青年的群众团体在大会以后，必将更为广大强壮，并把中国青年运动推进到更高的水平。
