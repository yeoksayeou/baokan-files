Party members Set an Example to Promote Drought-Resistant Sowing: Ba County and Other Places Rush to Dig Wells and Plant Seeds

[This newspaper comprehensive report] Ba County, Hejian, Daxing and other places in the Jizhong area are seizing the sowing season, with party members taking the lead and mobilizing farmers to help each other dig wells and rush to sow. Since the Qingming Festival, the cotton planting areas (Districts Five and Six) of Ba County have been assisted by the county promotion cooperatives to purchase 66,886 jin of good cotton seeds for the masses. However, due to the drought and dry land, it was difficult to sow, and the masses were very anxious. The county and district cadres immediately grasped the organization of the masses to dig wells and plant seeds. At the beginning, the masses emphasized the difficulties, such as some places being "quicksand," and the well tubes were prone to collapse. However, thanks to the cadres' determination to overcome difficulties, they finally mobilized the masses to come up with methods such as using reed mats to overcome the difficulties. Farmers in District Five have formed well-digging groups based on the distance of their land. Thirty-five villages have dug 426 earthen wells. Some farmers spontaneously dug up the bricks of the temple foundation to repair the wells. The farmers in Xiangying Village dug up the bricks from the distributed foundation, enough to repair ten wells. Party members played a significant leading role in drought prevention and well digging. Party members in Wangliangzhuang, District Seven, each brought three to five people to form a group to dig wells, and they have dug forty earthen wells, which can irrigate 400 mu of land. They are now happily using the new wells to irrigate and plant cotton. Before the Guyu Festival, District Six of Hejian made various efforts to persuade farmers to plant cash crops and exceeded the original plan. However, when the sowing season arrived, due to the drought, a considerable number of cadres developed passive ideas of waiting for rain. After review, going deeper, it was found that the masses also generally had the idea of not wanting to sow due to the drought, and at the same time, it was pointed out that it was impossible for a single household to dig a well and plant seeds alone. The district cadres immediately took the lead in helping farmers to dig wells. Now, more than 80 households in Lihu Village have formed 28 groups and have prepared buckets and water carts to start planting. Under the leadership of party members, Beixinhekou Village has dug eight earthen wells and is rushing to complete ten earthen wells. Newly turned farmers in Daxing District Eight launched a rush to sow. From the Qingming Festival to now, nine villages have sown 9,887 mu of grain. In order to catch up with the planting as soon as possible, nine villages, including Yizhuang, set up 203 planting mutual aid groups, in which 584 livestock were organized to share plows. In Weishanzhuang and Yizhuang villages alone, 180 women participated in mutual aid planting. Du Shuqin and her sisters-in-law and Li Zongyuan shared a plow and planted 32 mu of land in two days. They said: "This year the land is dry, and if each person is responsible for their own plowing, the land will dry out before sowing. Combining plowing, planting, and harrowing at the same time can keep the moisture in the soil and allow the seeds to germinate well."

At present, it is the sowing season, but from the perspective of the entire North China region, the idea of waiting for rain exists in most areas, and no various negative methods have been considered to organize sowing. This requires the leaders of various places to pay attention, learn from the experience of Ba County and other places, and take action quickly.

　　党员做出榜样推动防旱播种　霸县等地突击打井点种
    【本报综合讯】冀中区霸县、河问、大兴等地抓紧播种季节，由党员带头并发动农民互助打井，突击播种。霸县植棉花点区（五、六区）自清明节以来由县推进社帮助群众，购进好棉籽六万六千八百八十六斤。但因天旱地干，不好播种，群众十分焦虑，县区干部随即抓紧组织群众打井点种，开始群众强调困难，如有些地方是“流砂”，井筒易塌等。但由于干部有克服困难的决心，终于发动了群众想出用下席圈、下苇圈等办法克服了困难。五区农民更根据地邻远近，结成打井组，三十五个村已打土井四百二十六眼，有的农民自发的去刨庙基砖来修井。香营村农民刨出分得地基的砖能修井十眼。党员在防旱打井中起了极大的带头作用，七区王良庄党员，每人带到三、五个结组打井，已挖成土井四十眼，能浇地四百亩，现正愉快的使用新井浇地种着棉花。河间六区在谷雨节前曾以各种努力来说服农民认种经济作物并超过原订计划。但在播种季节到来时，却由于天旱，在相当不少的干部中发生了消极的等雨思想。经检讨后，深入下去，才发现群众中亦普遍有天旱不愿播种的思想，同时提出一户单独打井点种力量办不到。区干部当即分头领导农民互助挖井，现李胡村已有八十多家组成了二十八组，并准备好了水桶，拉水车等已开始点种，北辛河口村在党员带动下，已挖好土井八眼，正为完成十眼土井而突击。大兴八区新翻身农民展开突击播种从清明节到现在九个村统计已播种谷物九千八百八十七亩。为了及早赶种，伊庄等九个村即搭起二百零三个耩地互助组，其中组织起五百八十四头牲口插犋，仅仅魏善庄、伊庄两村，即有一百八十名妇女参加互助播种。北辛屯杜书琴妯娌三个与李总元插犋两天即耩地三十二亩。他们说：“今年地干，各管各耕完了地再下种地就干透了，结合起来一边耕、一边耩、一边砘地，就湿气一下种好能出好苗。”
    目前正在播种的时节，但从全华北区的情况看，在多数地区存在着等雨思想，未想各种消极办法组织播种。这极须引起各地领导上重视，学习霸县等地的经验，迅速行动起来。
