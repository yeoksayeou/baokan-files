　　After Begging India and Pakistan
  　Thakin Nu Returns to Burma
    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 17th. Reports from various sources: Burmese Prime Minister Thakin Nu returned to Rangoon on the 16th after a five-day visit to India and Pakistan. Thakin Nu arrived in New Delhi on the 11th, held secret talks with Indian Prime Minister Nehru on the 12th, and attended a secret meeting of eleven Asian nations hosted by Nehru on the 13th. Subsequently, Thakin Nu went to Karachi for talks with Pakistani Prime Minister Liaquat Ali Khan. According to Thakin Nu's admission to reporters on the 14th, he had requested Liaquat Ali Khan to ask Britain for military and financial assistance to the Burmese government when he attends the British Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference in England in the near future. According to an Agence France-Presse dispatch from New Delhi, Thakin Nu also made the same request to Nehru, who expressed his willingness to help the Burmese government, "but asked the Burmese government to reconsider the mediation proposal put forward by the four-nation British conference (Britain, Australia, Ceylon, India) convened by Nehru in New Delhi in February." The proposal called for the above four countries to "mediate" the disputes between the two British puppet factions in Burma (the Thakin Nu government and the upper echelons of the Karen people), which Thakin Nu did not accept at the time.

　　向印、巴乞怜后
  　达钦努返缅
    【新华社北平十七日电】各方报道：缅甸总理达钦努于十六日离新德里返抵仰光，结束了他在印度和巴基斯坦为时五日的活动。达钦努十一日到达新德里，十二日和印总理尼赫鲁密谈，并于十三日参加尼赫鲁主持的亚洲十一国秘密会议。随后，达钦努又到喀啦蚩与巴基斯坦总理艾里克汉举行会谈。据达钦努十四日对新闻记者承认，他曾要求艾里克汉在不久以后赴英参加英国自治领总理会议时，代他请求英国给缅甸政府以军火与材政的援助。据法新社新德里电称，达钦努亦曾向尼赫鲁作同样的请求，尼赫鲁表示愿予缅政府以帮助，“但要求缅政府重新考虑二月间尼赫鲁在新德里召开的大不列颠四国会议（英、澳、锡兰、印度）所提出的调解建议”。该建议要求由上述四国“调解”英国在缅甸两派走卒（达钦努政府与克伦族上层分子）之间的纷争，当时达钦努没有接受此项建议。
