Xinhua News Agency, Yangtze Front, April 25th: The People's Liberation Army's morale is exceptionally high during the Yangtze River Crossing Campaign. The competition among commanders and soldiers to participate in the assault and ride the first boat across the river is one of the moving examples. Before crossing the river, the commanders and fighters of the Second Field Army all eagerly petitioned their superiors, stating their reasons why they should be assigned to the assault team. As a result, the three companies of a certain battalion argued fiercely. The soldiers of the Seventh Company argued that the assault mission should be assigned according to the sequence of their organizational structure. The Ninth Company argued that this mission should be rotated from the back. The Eighth Company said that neither sequential nor reverse order was fair, and that it should start from the middle. Another battalion argued that they should be in the first echelon because they had not been assigned a main attack mission in the Huaihai Campaign. Various heroic model units and individuals competed based on their past heroic deeds. The leader of a certain regiment that first assaulted the natural barrier of the Yellow River said, "We have experience in successful forceful crossings and should be allowed to cross the river first." Yin Xiaosan, a special-class hero of a certain unit, said, "I have performed meritorious service in the Dabie Mountains and in the Huaihai Campaign. This time, when we fight across the Yangtze River, I should ride the first boat." Wang Xuezhi, a new hero who was liberated in the Huaihai Campaign, requested to be allowed to test his loyalty in the battle to cross the river in an assault, on the grounds that he had just joined the Communist Party. It was with this heroic spirit of the commanders and fighters that the People's Liberation Army broke through the Yangtze River in one fell swoop.

　　争坐渡江第一船
  　第二野战军的英雄气概
    【新华社长江前线二十五日电】人民解放军在渡江作战中，士气旺盛无比，指挥员、战斗员们为参加突击和坐过江第一船的竞争是动人的例子之一。第二野战军的指战员们在渡江前都争向上级申说他应当担任突击队的理由。某营的三个连队因此而争得面红耳赤。七连的战士们主张：突击任务应该按着编制顺序排列。九连主张：这次的任务应该由后面轮起。八连却说：顺数倒数都不公道，得从中间开始。另一个营则以淮海战役中未轮到担任主攻任务为理由，提出第一梯队应由他们这一营来担任。各个英雄模范单位及个人则以过去的英勇事迹来竞选。首先突击黄河天险的某团团首长说：“我们有胜利强渡的经验，应该让我们最先渡江。”某部特等英雄尹孝三说：“我在大别山立过功，在淮海战役中立过功。这次打过长江去，我应当坐第一船。”淮海战役解放过来的新英雄王学志，则以他刚参加共产党为理由，要求让他在突击过江的战斗中考验他的忠诚。就在指战员们的这种英雄气概下，人民解放军一举突破了长江。
