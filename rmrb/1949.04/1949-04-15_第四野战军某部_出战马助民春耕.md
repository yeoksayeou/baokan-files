　　Fourth Field Army Unit
  　Sends War Horses to Help Peasants with Spring Ploughing
    [Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 12th] A follow-up unit of the Fourth Field Army, awaiting orders to move south, is actively helping local farmers with spring ploughing during their downtime. Troops stationed in a certain area have allocated over a hundred war horses, thirty carts, and over two hundred soldiers to form an agricultural assistance team. A certain regiment, having just undergone vaccinations, disregarded their arm pain and eagerly threw themselves into labor. The regiment commander also took the lead by personally carrying manure. The area where a certain division is stationed is a newly liberated area. After receiving assistance from this division, 518 impoverished peasant households in the area can now carry out spring ploughing smoothly this year. The local farmers are full of praise for the People's Liberation Army's spirit of serving the people and their working-class character, and they have been continuously sending eggs, peanuts, and dumplings to the soldiers, but all have been politely declined. An old woman in Madu Village grabbed a soldier who was carrying manure for her and said, "Every year in the spring, I am filled with sorrow because I have no way to get the manure to the fields. This year is so much better. I really don't know how to thank you!"

　　第四野战军某部
  　出战马助民春耕
    【新华社北平十二日电】第四野战军待命南下的后续部队，利用空隙，积极帮助驻地农民春耕。某地驻军抽出一百多匹战马，三十辆大车和二百余名战士组成了助耕队。某团刚刚施行防疫注射后，大家不顾臂痛争先投入劳动。该团团长并以身作则，亲身挑粪。某师驻地是新解放区，当地五百一十八户贫苦农民得到该师的帮助后，今年春耕已可顺利进行。各地农民对解放军为民服务的精神和劳动本色赞叹不已，纷纷给战士送鸡蛋、花生、饺子，但都被一一婉言谢绝。马度村一个老大娘拉着正在替她挑粪的战士说：“我年年到春天就愁得掉泪，没法把粪送到地里。今年可好了。真不知怎样谢你们才好哪！”
