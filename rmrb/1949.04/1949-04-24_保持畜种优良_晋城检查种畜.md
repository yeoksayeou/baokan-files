　　To maintain superior livestock breeds
  　Jincheng Inspects Breeding Animals
    [Taiyue Telegram] In order to systematically increase the purchase of breeding livestock, strengthen reproduction, and maintain superior breeds, the Jincheng County Government convened a meeting on the 6th of this month to inspect breeding animals. Eleven inseminators, one veterinarian, and two farm cadres attended the meeting, and eleven breeding animals were inspected. The inspection was conducted based on the age of the breeding animals, the health of their physique, and the presence or absence of infectious diseases. During the exchange of insemination experiences, inseminator Song Shutai said: "Insemination can be done from Jingzhe (Awakening of Insects) to Bailu (White Dew). For light-mouthed female livestock, inseminate five or six days after the end of menstruation. Old female livestock must be inseminated as soon as menstruation is observed to ensure successful insemination." Inseminator Ma Dan said: "Female livestock can be mated after two years, and breeding animals are best suited for insemination after seven years; one breeding animal can inseminate one hundred female livestock." Due to the lack of breeding animals, only one-third of the female livestock can be mated each year, with a success rate of generally 70% to 80%. Since insemination began in February this year, all breeding animals in the county have now inseminated one hundred and ten animals. Finally, it was decided that breeding animals should be inspected once a year in February, and a meeting should be held in the autumn (June-July) to summarize achievements and award prizes accordingly. Breeding animal certificates were also issued at the meeting.

　　保持畜种优良
  　晋城检查种畜
    【太岳电】为了有计划地增购种畜、加强繁殖，并保持畜种优良，晋城县政府于本月六日召开检查种畜会议。参加会议的有配种行手十一人、兽医一人、农场干部二人，检查种畜十一头。根据种畜的年齿、体格的健康、有无传染病等，进行检查。在交流配种经验的时候，配种行手宋书太说：“从惊蛰到白露都能配种，口轻的母畜，过了行经期五、六天后配种，老母牲口一见行经就得配才能配准。”行手马旦说：“母牲口二年以后就可交配，种畜七年以后才好进行配种；一头种畜能配一百头母牲口。”因为种畜缺乏，每年只有三分之一的母牲口能进行交配，配准的一般在百分之七十到八十。全县所有种畜，今年从二月份配种以来，到现在已经配了一百一十头。最后大家决定每年二月检查一次种畜，秋天（六、七月间）开一次会，总结成绩，分别奖励。会上并发了种畜证明书。
