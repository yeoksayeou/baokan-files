　　April 12th—A Day of Great Blood in History
  　Excerpt from Chapter 2, Section 6 of "Chiang Kai-shek, Public Enemy of the People"
    Chen Boda
    On March 11, 1927, Chiang Kai-shek instigated his running dogs to brutally murder Chen Zanxian, Chairman of the Ganzhou General Labor Union. On the 16th, Duan Xipeng, Chiang Kai-shek's running dog, under Chiang Kai-shek's orders, disbanded the Nanchang Kuomintang Municipal Party Department, which supported Sun Yat-sen's three major policies. The counter-revolutionary AB Group, under Chiang Kai-shek's instigation, dared to hold flags in the streets of Nanchang and make counter-revolutionary shouts. On the 17th, Chiang Kai-shek ordered his running dogs to gather special agents and thugs to shout slogans such as "Long live the new warlords," "Long live Commander-in-Chief Chiang," and "Down with the Red elements." They used spears and broadswords to attack the Jiujiang Kuomintang Municipal Party Department and the County Labor Union, both of which supported Sun Yat-sen's three major policies, and many workers were injured. The workers' organization, the pickets, prepared to disarm the rioters, but Chiang Kai-shek immediately sent the Guard Battalion to suppress the workers and cover the rioters' departure from the city. Under the pretext of protection, he deployed troops to occupy the Municipal Party Department and the General Labor Union. That evening, Chiang Kai-shek immediately established a martial law command to suppress the workers' resistance. On the 23rd, in Anqing, special agents and thugs were again used under the guise of pseudo-organizations such as the so-called "Anhui General Labor Union" to launch a rally to welcome Chiang Kai-shek. Thugs were bought for four yuan each to form a hundred-man suicide squad, with agreed rewards: 100 yuan for minor injuries, 500 yuan for serious injuries, and 1,500 yuan for death, to kill revolutionary elements during the rally. At the end of this month, Chiang Kai-shek's fascist thugs and bandits began their reign of terror of massacres in Fujian and Sichuan.
    Of course, Chiang Kai-shek's final major action was still waiting. The troops that had achieved military success in the Northern Expedition were not all reliable for Chiang Kai-shek. Part of the First Army, led by He Yingqin of the Chiang family clique, took advantage of Sun Chuanfang's main force in Jiangxi and Zhou Yinren's internal divisions to enter Fujian almost without a fight. There, they expanded their forces. Chiang Kai-shek was waiting to connect with this force and to gather some troops who had defected from the northern warlords to serve as the vanguard of the counter-revolution. At the same time, Chiang Kai-shek had long been scheming to seize Nanjing and Shanghai in order to obtain a national political position for the counter-revolution. Especially there, it was convenient to conduct direct political transactions with imperialism and directly obtain imperialist assistance. Chiang Kai-shek needed to wait for those troops he was waiting for to arrive at these locations before he could recklessly launch a major counter-revolutionary coup. After Chiang Kai-shek devoted all his efforts to arranging counter-revolutionary activities in Nanchang from the end of 1926, he still sometimes pretended to be "benevolent and righteous." For example, in the "Declaration of the Outline for Party Affairs Propaganda" issued by Chiang Kai-shek on February 25, hatred of the revolution was revealed between the lines, but it also stated, "For the resolutions of the Central Party Headquarters (i.e., the resolutions of the Wuhan Kuomintang Central Committee on implementing democracy and opposing dictatorship), do not forget them for a moment." All of this was to paralyze the vigilance of the revolutionaries. In fact, what he did "not forget for a moment" was how to arrange the counter-revolution.
    Nanjing and Shanghai were not captured by Chiang Kai-shek's troops. Nanjing was captured by troops (i.e., the Sixth Army and the Second Army, which were then under the command of Wuhan) in which communists (with Lin Zuhan as the main representative) participated in the leadership and combat. Shanghai was captured by the Shanghai working class during the Third Armed Uprising. When the Northern Expeditionary Army captured Nanjing, American and British warships shelled Nanjing, relentlessly for days, killing more than two thousand Chinese and causing incalculable property damage. But this shelling by American and British imperialism suited Chiang Kai-shek's wishes, because it allowed Chiang Kai-shek to immediately seize the opportunity to gain a foothold in Nanjing.
    In March, Chiang Kai-shek watched as the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal great vanguard—the revolutionary workers of Shanghai—engaged in bloody battles with the northern warlords, but he held back his troops and did not advance. Chiang Kai-shek planned: first, to let the Shanghai workers fight the northern warlords independently, and then Chiang Kai-shek would step on the backs of the Shanghai workers who were injured in the fighting and not immediately prepared to guard against Chiang Kai-shek's betrayal. In this way, Chiang Kai-shek could both reap the fruits of capturing Shanghai and facilitate the bloody counter-revolution. After the Shanghai workers drove out the northern warlords, Chiang Kai-shek's counter-revolutionary footsteps followed.
    As soon as Chiang Kai-shek arrived in Shanghai, he stayed at the Longhua Commissioner's Office. Chiang Kai-shek did not even have time to inspect the exchange where he had originally engaged in economic activities, and immediately opened this political exchange. He went to the "foreigners," and the "foreigners" were also busy coming and going to him. Chiang Kai-shek had dealings with Japanese imperialists through Huang Fu, Dai Jitao, Wang Zhengting and others, with British and American imperialists through Yu Qiaqing, Song Ziwen and others, and with French imperialists through Wu Zhihui, Li Shizeng, Niu Yongjian and others. This was an unprecedented bloody deal in history. The buying and selling of people, opium, and munitions in the dark market of Shanghai was simply incomparable and incomparable to Chiang Kai-shek's bloody deal with the fate of the entire Chinese nation as a bet. In this bloody transaction with the imperialists, Chiang Kai-shek's old bosses and old friends either provided money or provided thugs. Those who provided money were his exchange bosses like Yu Qiaqing, and those who provided thugs were his gangster masters Huang Jinrong and Zhang Xiaolin.
    This greatest executioner in history, while plotting this greatest "cruel conspiracy" in history with the imperialists, continued to use his other set of "cunning tricks." A few days before the "April 12th" incident, he even sent a band to the revolutionary Shanghai General Labor Union, presenting red flags to express his "respect" for the revolutionary workers of Shanghai. Chiang Kai-shek continued to exploit the Communist Party members' honesty and gullibility in order to launch a sudden attack on the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people, and Chen Duxiu's opportunism, with its repeated concessions to the counter-revolution, failed to prepare defenses, thus practically assisting Chiang Kai-shek in this sudden attack.
    Patriotic compatriots! Toiling compatriots! Forever remember the year of the Republic of China, sixteen—that is, 1927! This is the greatest day of blood in Chinese history! First, Chiang Kai-shek, on the one hand, gathered those troops under his command, preparing for a massacre, and on the other hand, provided 50,000 yuan to the "Zhonghua Gongjinhui" organized by gangster bosses such as Huang Jinrong and Zhang Xiaolin, summoning a group of thugs, lining up in formations with "worker" symbols wrapped around their sleeves, and beginning to attack the workers' pickets. The pickets resisted. On this day, patriotic compatriots! Toiling compatriots! Remember, it was April 12th, Chiang Kai-shek, this murderous demon, began the massacre! Chiang Kai-shek dispatched troops, using the pretext of "worker infighting," taking advantage of the revolution's lack of preparedness, and disarming the workers' pickets who had fought bloody battles with the northern warlords! At this time, the workers were still too honest with this former ally. All the workers in Shanghai went to Zhabei to hold a mass rally and "petition" the headquarters, but Chiang Kai-shek had already made arrangements there, meeting the "petitioning" masses with gunfire. Just as the workers were increasing in number, patriotic compatriots, toiling compatriots, remember, it was Chiang Kai-shek who ordered machine guns to be used for sweeping fire! The workers' corpses fell one by one, covering the streets! From the day Chiang Kai-shek raised the butcher's knife, Shanghai and all places where Chiang's party followers had power were continuously filled with open and secret killing terror. After April 12th, Chiang Kai-shek, in alliance with the various imperialists, implemented various brutal and vicious policies of threats, blockades, inducements, and divisions against Wuhan, exploiting the internal contradictions in Wuhan (including a large number of speculators and the different forces of large landlords and the big bourgeoisie), colluding with traitors to create chaos, and massacring the peasant revolution in order to disintegrate the revolutionary situation in Wuhan. At the same time, Chen Duxiu's opportunism rejected Mao Zedong's firm policy of supporting the peasant revolution and arming the people, and accepted Wang Jingwei's counter-revolutionary policy of disarming the workers' pickets, which in fact helped Chiang Kai-shek and Wang Jingwei, who was planning to betray the revolution. As expected, Wang Jingwei, who was staying in Wuhan, quickly caught up with Chiang Kai-shek. "Better to kill a thousand innocent people than to let one guilty person go" became the slogan of Chiang and Wang's killing competition to curry favor with the imperialists. The national essence gathered since the May Fourth Movement, outstanding revolutionary figures, whether workers, peasants, or intellectuals, such as Chen Yannian, Zhao Shiyan, Wang Shouhua, Xiao Chunu, Zhang Tailei, Luo Yinong... etc., all these priceless national treasures, were beheaded under the knives of Chiang Kai-shek and Wang Jingwei. Chiang Kai-shek and Wang Jingwei regarded it as cutting grass, offering this countless number of revolutionary corpses as a presentation gift to gain the trust of the imperialists. No great plague in the world could compare to the horror of the deaths under Chiang Kai-shek's knife. At the same time, the heroic and magnificent bloodshed of the Chinese people for freedom, advancing wave upon wave, illuminated the great Chinese nation and demonstrated that the Chinese nation would surely be liberated and live forever, while the executioner Chiang Kai-shek and his gang of lackeys would not escape the final judgment of the people's justice.
    Mao Zedong called Chiang Kai-shek's great historical betrayal "treason" and "breach of faith" (see On Coalition Government). Everyone see! Chiang Kai-shek was so full of promises, declaring how loyal he was to Sun Yat-sen's three major policies, and that he had achieved military victory and political status entirely relying on the help of the Chinese Communist Party and the help of the Soviet Union. But in the blink of an eye, he was so ungrateful and ruthless, "yesterday's allies—the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people—were regarded as enemies, and yesterday's enemies—the imperialists and feudalists—were regarded as allies." And the means adopted was such a large-scale and extremely cruel surprise attack. This is truly called "a man without conscience has reached this point," a complete destruction of morality.

　　四一二——历史的大血日
  　“人民公敌蒋介石”第二章第六节摘录
    陈伯达
    一九二七年三月十一日，蒋介石即唆使他的走狗惨杀赣州总工会委员长陈赞贤。十六日，蒋介石的走狗段锡朋受蒋介石命令解散拥护孙中山三大政策的南昌国民党市党部。反革命的ＡＢ团就在蒋介石的策动之下，敢在南昌街上拿着旗子，作反革命的喊叫。十七日，蒋介石叫他的走狗集合特务流氓呼“新军阀万岁”、“蒋总司令万岁”、“打倒赤化分子”等口号，手持长矛大刀围攻拥护孙中山三大政策的九江国民党市党部与县工会，工会多人受伤。工人组织纠察队准备解除暴徒武装，蒋介石即派卫士大队弹压工人，掩护暴徒出市；并以保护为名，调兵占领市党部与总工会。当晚，蒋介石即设戒严司令，以压迫工人的反抗。二十三日在安庆又叫特务流氓利用伪团体如所谓“安徽总工会”的名义，发起大会欢迎蒋介石，并用每名四元的身价，收买流氓，成立一百人的敢死队，约定敢死队赏格，轻伤者赏一百元，重伤者五百元，丧命者一千五百元，要他们在大会中杀害革命分子。这个月底，蒋介石的法西斯暴徒匪类，并在福建四川即开始屠杀的恐怖。
    当然，蒋介石的最后大行动，还有所等待。北伐中原来有战功的部队对于蒋介石都不是可靠的。第一军还有一部分由蒋家党何应钦带领，这部分在福建方面利用孙传芳主力在江西和周荫人内部的分化，几乎没有打什么仗，就直入福建，遂又在那里扩充兵力，蒋介石要等待接上这个部队，又要等待搜集一些从北方军阀投靠过来的部队，以便作为反革命的先锋。同时，蒋介石原来处心积虑，既然是要取得南京上海，以取得反革命的全国政治地位，特别是在那里便于和帝国主义作直接的政治交易，便于直接取得帝国主义的援助，蒋介石就需要他所等待的那些部队到达这些地点以后，他才能放肆发动反革命的大政变。蒋介石从一九二六年底在南昌用全力布置反革命活动以后，也还有时装得“假仁假义”，比如：蒋介石二月二十五日所发的“对党务宣传大纲宣言”，那里字里行间，都流露了他对革命的仇恨，可是却又写着“对于中央党部之决议（即武汉国民党中央关于实行民主反对独裁的决议），一时一刻，毋或少忘”。这些都就是为的麻痹革命者的警觉，事实上，他“一时一刻，毋或少忘”的，乃是布置如何反革命。
    南京上海都不是蒋介石的部队打下的。南京是当时有共产党人（以林祖涵为主要代表）参加领导和参加作战的部队（即第六军与第二军，当时这两军是受武汉的命令）打下的，上海是第三次起义的上海工人阶级打下的。当北伐军攻下南京的时候，美英军舰向南京开炮轰击，连日不绝，中国人死了两千多个，财产的损失不计其数，但美英帝国主义这个炮击，正合了蒋介石的心愿，因为这使得蒋介石得以马上利用机会插脚到南京来。
    在三月间，蒋介石望着反帝反封建的伟大先锋队——上海革命工人的力量与北洋军阀进行流血的苦战，而按兵不进。蒋介石计划：先让上海工人去独力和北洋军阀作战，然后蒋介石的脚就踏在那因作战受伤、并且没有马上准备提防蒋介石反水的上海工人的背上，这样，蒋介石就既可坐受克复上海的果实，又可便于进行流血的反革命。在上海工人驱逐北洋军阀之后，蒋介石反革命的脚步也跟着来到了。
    蒋介石一到上海，便住龙华交涉员公署。蒋介石还来不及先去视察他原来所从事的经济活动的交易所，就马上先开起这个政治交易所。他到“外国人”那里去，“外国人”也在他这里忙进忙出。蒋介石经过黄郛、戴季陶、王正廷等人和日本帝国主义者来往，经过虞洽卿、宋子文等人和英帝国主义者、美帝国主义者来往，经过吴稚晖，李石曾，钮永建等人和法帝国主义者来往。这是一宗历史上空前的血腥大买卖。原来上海黑暗市场所进行的关于人口、鸦片、军火这类的买卖，比起蒋介石这宗以中华全民族的命运为赌注的血腥大买卖，都简直小得无法比拟，也不便比拟。在这宗与帝国主义者血腥的交易当中，蒋介石的老上司和老朋友，就有的出钱，有的出打手。出钱的就是他的交易所老板虞洽卿之类，出打手的就是他的流氓老师父黄金荣、张啸林之类。
    这个历史上最大的刽子手在与帝国主义者布置这个历史上最大的“残忍阴谋”的时候，继续使用他的另一套“机巧权术”，在“四一二”的前几天，还派遣了音乐队给革命的上海总工会挂红送旗，以表示他对于上海革命工人的“敬意”。蒋介石继续利用共产党人的诚实可欺，以便向着中国共产党与中国人民进行突然的袭击，而陈独秀机会主义对于反革命的各种让步又让步，没有去准备提防，因此就实际地帮助了蒋介石这一突然的袭击。
    四月十二日，爱国的同胞们！劳苦的同胞们！永远地记着民国十六年——即一九二七年这一个日子！这是中国历史上最大的血日！先是，蒋介石一方面集合了那些供他指使的部队，准备大屠杀，一方面拿五万元供给黄金荣、张啸林等流氓头子所组织的“中华共进会”，召集一批流氓，排成队伍，袖缠“工”字符号，开始袭击工人纠察队，纠察队加以抵抗。在这一个日子，爱国的同胞们！劳苦的同胞们！记着，就是四月十二日，蒋介石，这个杀人不眨眼的魔王，开始举行大屠杀！蒋介石派遣军队，借口什么“工人内讧”，利用革命方面没有防备，把原来与北洋军阀血战的工人纠察队缴械了！这时候，工人们对于这个昨天的同盟者还仍然是太老实了，全上海工人到闸北开群众大会，并往司令部“请愿”，但蒋介石在那里早布置下了，对“请愿”的群众来一个迎面开枪。正当工人们越来越多的时候，爱国的同胞们，劳苦的同胞们，记着，就是蒋介石，他命令用机关枪扫射了！工人们的尸首一个一个地倒满街路上！从蒋介石提起屠刀这一天开始，在上海，在一切蒋家党徒力量所到的地方，都继续不断地充满了公开的与秘密的杀人的恐怖。四一二之后，蒋介石联合各帝国主义，对于武汉实行威胁、封锁、利诱、分化的各项残暴与恶毒的政策，利用武汉内部的矛盾（其中有很大的一部分投机分子，还有大地主与大资产阶级的不同势力），勾结叛徒作乱，屠杀农民革命，以瓦解武汉的革命局面，同时，陈独秀机会主义拒绝毛泽东拥护农民革命与武装人民的坚决政策，并且接受汪精卫解除工人纠察队武装的反革命政策，恰恰又是在实际上帮助了蒋介石与正在计划叛变的汪精卫。果然，逗留武汉的汪精卫很快也赶上蒋介石来了。“宁可错杀千百，不可放走一人”，成了蒋汪向帝国主义献媚的杀人竞赛的标语，五四以来所结集的民族精华，优秀的革命人物，或是工人，或是农民，或是知识分子，如陈延年、赵世炎、汪寿华、萧楚女、张太雷，罗亦农……等等，这一切无价的民族珍宝，在蒋介石汪精卫的刀下，被割断了头颅，蒋介石汪精卫看得完全象割草一样，把这无量数的革命尸首作为取信于帝国主义的贽见礼。不论世界上那次大瘟疫，都比不上这次蒋介石刀下死亡之惨，同时，中国人民为自由流血的英勇壮烈，前仆后继，则为伟大中华民族大放光明，并说明了中华民族必将得到解放而永生，而刽子手蒋介石和他的一批狗奴才必不能逃免人民正义的最后裁判。
    毛泽东称蒋介石这个历史的大背叛为“叛卖”，为“背信弃义”（见论联合政府）。大家看！蒋介石原来是那末信誓旦旦，宣称他如何忠实于孙中山的三大政策，而且完全是依靠中国共产党的帮助，依靠苏联的帮助，才获得了军事的胜利与政治地位。但是，转瞬之间，他竟然那末忘恩负义，翻脸无情，“昨天的同盟者——中国共产党与中国人民，被看成了仇敌，昨天的敌人——帝国主义者与封建主义者，被看成了同盟者”。并且采用的手段，是这样大规模与极残酷的突然袭击。这真叫做“人之无良，一至于此”，是道德的完全毁灭。
