　　Ping City Industry and Commerce Bureau Actively Rectifies Grain Market to Stabilize Grain Prices
    [This newspaper report] In order to enrich the people's food supply, stabilize grain prices, prevent unscrupulous merchants from speculating and manipulating the market, and protect the interests of legitimate merchants, the Ping City Industry and Commerce Bureau has carried out preliminary rectification of the grain market in the area around the former four clock towers. The work of re-registering grain merchants is now largely completed. As of the 6th, 1,830 grain merchant units had completed the registration procedures, and 320 units had been issued temporary admission permits pending completion of the procedures. In addition, 76 peddlers were approved and issued temporary grain selling permits for entry into the market. The representative of the Bureau stationed in the grain market and the Grain Market Rectification Committee formally issued an announcement yesterday (the 5th), stipulating: (1) From April 6th, merchants buying and selling food grains must wear badges (issued by the Industry and Commerce Bureau; yellow for grain sellers, white for buyers, and blue for flour processors and sesame oil businesses) and present permits. Those without badges and permits will not be allowed to enter. (2) Grain sellers must indicate their name and address on the cloth bags carrying samples to facilitate transactions. (3) Buyers are not allowed to buy grain in the market. Sellers are not allowed to buy grain in the market. Other industries are limited to purchasing raw materials for their business to prevent speculation. (4) Non-grain food samples are prohibited from being sold in the market.
