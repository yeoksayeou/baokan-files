School Life:

　　▲ Under the call of the Yanjing University Student Self-Government Association to "Transform Yanyuan," 176 male and female students have devoted themselves to spring plowing and sowing. In less than a week, they have reclaimed more than ten acres of wasteland and repaired the ridges. They will grow vegetables on this land, sell them for money to pay tuition, and reduce the burden on the people. Although many students have broken their hands and raised blisters during the labor, they are still working very hard.

　　燕大不少同学开荒种菜交学费
    ▲燕京大学在自治会“改造燕园”的号召下，一百七十六个男女同学投入了春耕下种，不到一星期已开垦了十来亩荒地，修好了畦，他们将在这块土地上种菜，卖了钱交学费，以减轻人民负担。虽然有许多同学在劳动中磨破了手，磨起了泡，但仍干得很带劲。
