What has the Shijiazhuang labor movement over the past two years taught us?

    The central government's directive: Rely on the proletariat, restore and develop production, and build a people's production city. This policy has been tested by the diligent work of the Party, the working class, and other laboring people of Shijiazhuang over the past two years and has proven to be completely correct. The Shijiazhuang Workers' Congress, which closed on the 6th of this month, also used it as a basic summary and guide for the future. Now, they are advancing confidently along this correct path with full of victorious confidence.

    What important insights do the experiences of the Shijiazhuang workers' movement and the production increase movement, published in this newspaper yesterday and the day before yesterday, give us? The most fundamental one is the question of whom to rely on. This issue has been most deeply felt in the work of Shijiazhuang over the past two years. At one time in Shijiazhuang's work, the work of the workers was neglected. The main work of each district and street was focused on the poor. Many cadres had an attitude of "incompatibility" with the working class, lacked the enthusiasm to go deep into the working masses and undergo proletarian tempering, and some even held a sense of aversion to the workers. This situation was soon corrected. The Shijiazhuang Party timely called on Party members and cadres to consciously rely on the proletariat, explicitly stipulating that relying on the proletariat to unite other laboring masses and democratic elements to build a people's Shijiazhuang as the direction of the work of the entire Party and the entire city, and together with the working class corrected various deviations, such as neglecting the work of the workers' movement, lacking political education for workers, lacking the due enthusiasm for the working class, and not caring about workers' lives. Struggles were carried out against various bureaucratic elements. This greatly improved the awareness and enthusiasm of the workers in Shijiazhuang, and the Party and the workers were closely united. On this basis, the production increase and loss recovery movement was successfully completed, thereby promoting the work of municipal construction in all aspects. The experience of Shijiazhuang on the one hand educated the Party members and cadres, enabling them to understand the idea of relying on the working class from practical work, and on the other hand also educated the entire working class, enabling them to understand that only by accepting the correct leadership of the Party—the vanguard of the proletariat—can the working class truly become the political and social leading class.

    How to rely on the working class? After solving the idea of relying on the proletariat, Shijiazhuang also explored some extremely important experiences.

    First, it is necessary to timely and appropriately meet the workers' immediate and pressing demands, solve all legitimate problems that can be solved for the workers, and oppose the bureaucratic style of ignoring the workers' interests. In state-owned factories, they established a wage system sufficient to guarantee the workers' lives, and established supply and marketing cooperatives to protect workers from price fluctuations and intermediate exploitation. At the same time, they paid attention to the workers' cultural and health life, and are now working on researching and establishing a labor insurance system. In private factories, they supported the workers in working with the capitalists to abolish various unreasonable systems, so as to achieve mutual benefit for both labor and capital. This enabled the workers to improve their awareness from their own experience, truly participate in the work with the conscious attitude of masters, closely rely on the Party, and unite other laboring people to build the city.

    Second, specific education was carried out for the working class in action, various types of workers' schools were organized, workers were led in political and cultural learning, and workers were mobilized to create. Furthermore, in the preparations for war, the struggle against bureaucracy, and the democratic management of production, the basic revolutionary principles were combined with specific actions to educate the working class, so that the workers understood the social status of the proletariat, understood the relationship between the Party and the working class, and understood the Party's leadership and the Party's policies and propositions. On the basis of the improvement of the working class's awareness, a large number of outstanding elements poured into the organizations of the Party and the Communist Youth League.

    Third, they carried out trade union organization work on the basis of the initial mobilization of the workers. At this workers' congress, the erroneous phenomenon of simply emphasizing administrative management and neglecting the leadership of the workers' movement was strictly criticized, the phenomenon of the trade union's status being subordinate to the administration was changed, stronger cadres were transferred to do trade union work, and trade union work was started as the central work of all mass work. Facts have proved that only by improving the trade union can the Party, the government, and the trade union closely cooperate and do the work smoothly.

    After achieving the above-mentioned achievements, Shijiazhuang, relying on the awareness and enthusiasm of the working class, systematically launched a production increase competition movement. This movement has opened up new paths, new labor attitudes, new productivity, new labor discipline, and the initial implementation of democratic factory management for future work. All of this has presented an active atmosphere not only in the factory production of Shijiazhuang, but also in all work. This is the most concrete and vivid explanation that the Party must first rely on the working class in the city.

    The Shijiazhuang Municipal Party Committee has issued the slogan of a comprehensive production increase competition movement to greet "May Day". We wish this movement victory and hope that all localities pay attention to studying the specific path actually taken by Shijiazhuang.

### 两年来石家庄工运告诉了我们些什么？

　　两年来石家庄工运告诉了我们些什么？
    中央所指示的：依靠无产阶级，恢复与发展生产，建设人民的生产城市，这一方针，已为石家庄的党、工人阶级及其他劳动人民两年来辛勤工作所考验，证明是完全正确的。本月六日闭幕的石市工代大会，又把它作为基本总结和今后指针。现在，他们正充满胜利信心沿着这一正确道路向前迈前。
    前昨两日本报发表的石家庄职工运动和增产运动的经验，给予我们一些什么重要的启示呢？最基本的一个是依靠谁的问题。这一问题在两年来石家庄的工作中体会的最为深刻。在石家庄工作中，曾经一个时候忽视了工人的工作。各区街主要的作了贫民工作。不少干部对于工人阶级存在了“格格不入”的态度，缺乏深入工人群众中去，经受无产阶级锻炼的热情，有的甚至对工人抱着嫌厌的情绪。这种情形，不久得到纠正，石家庄的党及时地号召党员干部自觉的依靠无产阶级，明确规定以依靠无产阶级团结其他劳动群众和民主分子，建设人民石家庄作为全党和全市的工作方向，并同工人阶级在一起纠正了各种偏向，举如忽视职工运动工作，缺乏对工人进行政治教育，缺少对工人阶级应有的热情，以及不关心工人生活等。同各种官僚主义分子进行了斗争。这样便使石家庄工人的觉悟与积极性大大提高，党与工人紧紧结合起来了，在这一基础上胜利地完成了增产补损运动，并从而推进了市政建设各方面的工作。石家庄的经验一方面教育了党员干部，使他们从实际工作中领会了依靠工人阶级的思想，另一方面也教育了全体工人阶级，使他们懂得只有接受党——无产阶级先锋队的正确领导，工人阶级才能真正成为政治上和社会上的领导阶级。
    如何依靠工人阶级？石家庄在解决了依靠无产阶级的思想后，也摸索到了一些极为重要的经验。
    第一、必须及时地适当地满足工人切身的当前的要求，解决工人一切正当的可能解决的问题，反对漠视工人利益的官僚主义作风，在公营工厂中，他们确立了足以保障工人生活的工资制，建立供销合作社使工人免受物价波动影响和中间剥削，同时关心到工人文化卫生生活，现正着手研究与建立劳动保险制。在私营工厂，则支持工人协同资方取消了各种不合理制度，使之达到劳资两利。这样使工人从亲身体验中提高了觉悟，真正以主人翁的自觉态度参加工作，同党紧紧地靠拢在一起，团结其他劳动人民建设城市。
    第二、是在行动中对工人阶级进行了具体教育，组织起各式各样的职工学校，领导工人政治文化学习，发动工人创作。更在备战中，反官僚主义斗争中，生产民主管理中，结合具体行动教育工人阶级以革命基本道理，使工人了解了无产阶级的社会地位，使他们体会了党和工人阶级的关系，认识党的领导及党的政策主张，在工人阶级觉悟提高的基础上，大批优秀分子涌进了党和青年团的组织。
    第三，他们在工人初步发动的基础上进行了工会组织工作，这次工代会上严格批判了单纯强调行政管理忽视职工运动领导的错误现象，改变工会地位附属于行政的现象，调整较强干部去做工会工作，开始把工会工作作为一切群众工作的中心工作。事实证明，只有健全工会，党政工才能密切配合，把工作顺利地搞好。
    石家庄在取得了上述成绩后，依靠着工人阶级的觉悟和热情，系统地开展了一个增产竞赛运动。这一运动给今后工作开辟了新的坦途、新的劳动态度、新的生产率、新的劳动纪律以及工厂管理民主化的初步实行，……这一切，都不但在石家庄工厂生产中，而且在一切工作中呈现出活跃的气象，这就是党在城市中首先要依靠工人阶级的最具体生动的说明。
    石市党委已发出全面增产竞赛运动以迎接“五一”的口号，我们预祝这一运动的胜利，并希望各地注意研究石家庄所实际走过的具体道路。
