　　The New Beiping Fire Brigade
    Chen Ji
    The Fire Brigade of the Beiping Municipal People's Government Public Security Bureau, including four squadrons and four detachments, has 314 firefighters, distributed in eight areas of Beiping: Public Security Street, Yanmen Temple Front Street, Liangjiayuan, Yangfeng Alley, Tianqiao, Beixinqiao, Donghuamen, and the Forbidden City.
    In the era of Kuomintang rule, the fire brigade almost became a private organization. The puppet captain Qiu Shangzhi could arbitrarily force police officers to open up wasteland and cultivate land for him; to "produce" for him. When Qiu's friends and relatives had weddings or funerals, firefighters were ordered to stand guard. For example, during the Mid-Autumn Festival last year, when Qiu's mentor Zhang Yinwu organized a recreational event, the police officers were there from morning to night guarding the premises.
    From the day of liberation, Beiping's fire brigade began anew. Under the leadership of the Military Control Commission representatives, they studied politics every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, discussing the Chinese revolution and urban policies. They did morning exercises every day, learned firefighting knowledge, and practiced climbing ladders and connecting water pipes. After such study and transformation, they showed an unprecedented sense of responsibility in their work. On March 23, when a fire broke out in the Pingmin Market outside Xuanwu Gate, Guo Duxing, Du Hongbo, and five others rushed into the fiery gap to prevent the fire from spreading, ensuring the safe preservation of nearby warehouses. At the end of March, during a fire at the Police Garrison Command in Tieshi Zi Hutong, Bai Sihe and six others, carrying water pipes and hooks, burrowed into the burning ceiling to shoot water. They began to establish the concept of serving the people, reversing the past bad habits of taking bribes and extorting money during firefighting. There was even such a thing: on April 11, when going to put out a fire at the Fuhexing Grain Store on Luomashi Street, Wang Fengshan fainted from the fire. The shopkeeper wanted to give him Ren Dan (a traditional Chinese medicine) to take, but Wang Wenbin quickly said, "No need, just a sip of cold water is enough." Later, the shopkeeper wanted to give them wine to drink, but they refused. This made the shopkeeper feel very strange, because when they came here to put out a fire last year, they had accepted two bags of rice from the store.
    In addition, after every major fire, they hold a work review meeting. At the review meeting, they commend firefighting heroes and criticize inactive and lazy elements. They also put forward many suggestions for future work, the most important of which are the following: 1. How to make the masses aware of the fire emergency telephone number (09), to report directly to the fire brigade, without having to go through the police stations, so as to dispatch quickly. 2. The order at the fire scene is too chaotic. People even move things from places far from the fire to the road, which is not only easy to be stolen, but also affects firefighting work. Ways to overcome this should be found in the future. 3. The location of the fire should be understood accurately. Where there is no water source, the masses should be mobilized to store water; where there is a water source, the water company should be notified to focus electricity on the vicinity of the fire, in order to increase water pressure. 4. There are too many sheds in the East Dan People's Market, and it is far from the water source. In this windy and dry weather, once a fire occurs, it will not be easy to put out. For example, for buildings that are prone to fire, such as Tianqiao and various factories, the masses should be widely mobilized to pay attention to fire prevention. They are now actively making suggestions, promoting what is beneficial and eliminating what is harmful, which is unprecedented.
    In order to further strengthen fire protection work, the Military Control Commission representatives called for the launch of the "Three Quicks and Three Loves" movement, which is to be quick to dispatch, quick to put out fires, and quick to extinguish fires; love learning, love equipment, and love the lives and property of the people. The First Squadron immediately responded. Whenever they had free time, they inspected equipment and carried out fire drills. Police officer Ke Ruiquan wrote a poem on the wall newspaper, which can show a glimpse of their ideological transformation:
    "Once there is a fire, it is like the enemy coming; the hundred number telephone, is our alarm, we actively dispatch, do not wait for the enemy to cause trouble; river water, well water, tap water, are our ammunition. Quick to dress, quick to dispatch, quick to put out, to serve the people, what glory, what glory!"

### 新生中的北平消防队

　　新生中的北平消防队
    陈迹
    北平市人民政府公安局的消防队，包括四个中队和四个分队，救火警员三百一十四人，分布在北平市内公安街、阎门庙前街、梁家园、养蜂夹道、天桥、北新桥、东华门、故宫八个地区。
    在国民党统治时代，消防队几乎成为私人的组织。伪队长邱尚质可以随意强迫警员替他开荒耕地；替他“生产”，邱家朋友亲戚有婚丧大事时，消防队员就被命令去站岗守卫。如去年八月节邱的师父张荫梧主办游艺会，警员们即从早到晚在那里守备。
    从解放的那天起，北平的消防队开始新生了。在军管会代表的领导下，每星期一三五学习政治，讨论中国革命问题和城市政策。他们每天清早上操，学习消防知识，演习上云梯、接水管。经过这样学习改造以后，他们在工作上表现了从来未有的负责精神。三月二十三日，在宣武门外平民市场发生火警时，郭笃行、杜洪波等五人冲进烈火隙地，阻止火势的蔓延，使附近仓库安全保存下来。三月底在铁狮子胡同警备司令部救火时，白思和等六人带着水管和钩子，钻到着火的顶棚去射水。他们开始树立起为人民服务的观念，一反过去在救火中受贿敲诈的恶习。甚至还有这样的事情：四月十一日去救骡马市大街福和兴粮食店火警时，王凤山被火昏倒了，该店掌柜要拿仁丹给他吃，王文斌连忙说：“不用，喝口凉水就行了。”后来掌柜要拿酒给他们喝，他们也拒绝了。使店掌柜很感奇怪。因为他们在去年来这里救火时，就曾接受过该店所馈送的两包大米。
    此外，每逢一次大的火灾以后，他们都要开工作检讨会。他们在检讨会上表扬救火的英雄，批评不积极的懒惰分子。他们并提出许多今后工作上的意见，其中最重要的有下列几点：一、怎样使群众知道火警专用电话（○九），直接报告消防队，不必再经过各警局分驻所，以便迅速出动。二、火场秩序太乱，距火场较远的群众也向马路上乱搬东西，这不但容易被窃盗，而且还影响救火工作。以后要设法克服。三、对火场地点要了解准确。没有水源的，要发动群众储水；有水源的地方，应通知自来水公司把电力专注在火警的附近，以增加水力。四、东单人民商场席棚太多，距离水源又远，在此风多气燥的天气里，一旦发生火警，是不易扑灭的。例如天桥以及各工厂等易于着火的建筑物，应广泛发动群众，注意防火。他们这样积极提意见，兴利除弊，是从来没有过的。
    为了进一步加强消防工作，军管会代表号召展开“三快三爱”运动，就是要出动快，救火快，灭火快；爱学习，爱护器材，爱护人民生命财产。第一中队马上响应，他们一遇空闲，就检点器材，展开消防演习。警员克瑞泉在壁报上写了一首诗，可以表现他们思想转变的一斑：
    “一旦有火警，就如敌人来到；一百号电话，就是我们的警报，我们积极出动，莫等敌人滋扰；河水、井水、自来水，就是我们的弹药。穿衣快、出动快、扑救快，为人民服务，多荣耀，多荣耀！”
