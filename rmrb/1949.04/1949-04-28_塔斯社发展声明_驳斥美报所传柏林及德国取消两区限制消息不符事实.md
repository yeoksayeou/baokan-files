    Refutes US Media Reports of Lifting Restrictions in Berlin and Germany's Two Zones as Untrue

    [Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, 27th] TASS Moscow, 25th: TASS issued the following statement: Recently, news has been appearing in foreign newspapers, mainly in American newspapers, discussing the possible simultaneous lifting of restrictions on transportation, traffic, and trade between Berlin and the Western occupation zones of Germany, and between the Eastern and Western occupation zones of Germany, by the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France. These reports have generated rumors that do not align with the facts. TASS considers it necessary to refute these incorrect rumors and report the truth.

    Because the US government is concerned about the Berlin issue, on February 15th, the US representative to the United Nations, Mr. Jessup, asked the Soviet representative to the Security Council, Mr. Malik, to explain the third paragraph of Stalin's reply to Mr. Smith of the International News Service regarding the Berlin issue. This paragraph discussed the issue of lifting restrictions but did not mention the issue of a unified currency. (Xinhua News Agency note: The original text of the third paragraph of Stalin's reply to Smith's question on January 30th is as follows: Smith asked: If the governments of the United States, Britain, and France agree to postpone the separate establishment of a West German state before convening a meeting of foreign ministers to comprehensively review the German issue, would the Soviet Union be willing to lift the traffic restrictions imposed by the Soviet authorities on traffic between Berlin and the Western occupation zones of Germany? Stalin replied: If the United States, Britain, and France comply with the conditions proposed in the third question, then the Soviet government believes that there are no obstacles to lifting transportation restrictions. However, this should be based on the understanding that, at the same time, the United States, Britain, and France should lift the restrictions they have imposed on transportation and trade.) Mr. Malik told Mr. Jessup that it was not accidental that the reply to Smith did not mention the currency issue; the Berlin currency issue could be discussed at a meeting of foreign ministers when studying the German issue.

    Mr. Jessup then asked Mr. Malik to clarify whether the existing restrictions on traffic could be lifted before the foreign ministers' meeting. Mr. Malik replied to Mr. Jessup on March 21st that if an agreement is reached on the date of the foreign ministers' meeting, the aforementioned reciprocal restrictions on traffic and trade could be lifted before the foreign ministers' meeting begins its work. As for the issue of a unified currency for Berlin, it can be discussed at the foreign ministers' meeting along with other issues related to Germany.

    According to TASS's available information, the most recent conversation between Mr. Malik and Mr. Jessup on the above issues took place on April 10th.

　　塔斯社发展声明
    驳斥美报所传柏林及德国取消两区限制消息不符事实
    【新华社北平二十七日电】塔斯社莫斯科二十五日电：塔斯社发表声明如下：最近一直在外国报纸主要是在美国报纸上出现的消息，谈到可能的由苏美英法同时取消柏林与德国西占区之间以及德国东占区与西占区之间对运输、交通和贸易所施行的限制，这些消息产生了不符各方事实的谣言。塔斯社认为必须驳斥这些不正确的谣言，并报道事实的真相。
    因为美国政府关心柏林问题，二月十五日，美国驻联合国代表耶塞普要求苏联驻安理会代表马立克解斯大林对国际新闻社记者史密斯先生的答复中关于柏林问题的第三段，该段曾谈到取消限制问题，但没有提及单一货币问题（新华社按：上引斯大林一月三十日答史密斯问第三段的原文如下：史密斯问：如果美国、英国和法国政府同意在召开外长会议以便整个地审议德国问题之前，延缓单独建立西德国家的话，苏联是否愿意准备取消苏联当局所已施于柏林与德国西部各占领区之间的交通限制？斯大林答：如果美国、英国和法国遵守第三个问题中所提出的条件的话，那么，苏联政府认为取消运输限制是没有什么障碍的。然而，这应以这种谅解为基础，即与此同时，英美法三国应取消其所实施的运输与贸易的限制。）马立克就这一问题告耶塞普先生称，在对史密斯的答复中，未谈及货币问题并不是偶然的，柏林的货币问题，可以在外长会议研究德国问题时讨论。
    耶塞普继而要求马立克说明现存的对交通的限制是否能在外长会议开会以前取消。马立克于三月二十一日答复耶塞普先生称，如果关于外长会议开会的日期达到了协议，上述对交通和贸易的交互限制可以在外长会议开始其工作以前取消。至于柏林单一货币问题，则可以在外长会议中与其他有关德国的问题一起讨论。
    据塔斯社现有消息，马立克与耶塞普先生之间关于上述问题的最近一次谈话是在四月十日。
