CCP Beiping Municipal Committee
  Invites Private Factory Owners to a Forum
  To Discuss Issues Related to Restoring and Developing Production
    The working class is the leading class; however, workers in private factories should obey the instructions of the factory director and should have labor discipline.
    If factory directors care about the lives of the workers and frequently consult with them on matters, things will go smoothly; otherwise, there will be many obstacles.
    [Reported by Our Newspaper Correspondent Ai Fang] Following a forum on the 19th with representatives of employees and factory directors of state-owned factories and a forum on the 20th with representatives of employees of privately owned factories, the CCP Beiping Municipal Committee convened a forum at 2:00 PM on the 21st with private industrial capitalists to discuss the issue of restoring and developing production. Present were 29 representatives, including Pu Jiexu, representing 28 factories in the machinery, flour, dyeing and weaving, carpet, match, kiln, and leather industries. Comrade Ye Jianying, the mayor, spoke first on behalf of the Municipal Committee to announce the opening of the meeting. He said: The Communist Party acts in accordance with the Party's policies and relies on the Party's policies to achieve leadership in all areas. The Chinese Communist Party has definite policies in economic, political, and cultural fields. How do we Communists achieve leadership in Beiping economically? That is by relying on the policy of "developing production, promoting economic prosperity, taking into account both public and private interests, and benefiting both labor and capital" stipulated by Chairman Mao, and by correctly implementing and realizing this policy. Our Municipal Committee has invited everyone here today to solicit and exchange views on this. Then, Comrade Peng Zhen said: We convened a meeting two days ago with representatives of the factory management and workers of state-owned factories to resolve the issues of how they could solve their mutual relations and quickly restore and develop production. Because in private enterprises, there are also many problems that urgently need to be solved. Yesterday we convened a forum with representatives of workers in privately owned factories to listen to their opinions. At that meeting, the workers recounted some of their past suffering and put forward many opinions regarding the development of production and labor-capital relations. Their opinions were very good. In the end, everyone agreed that labor and capital should both benefit, that capitalists should be able to make money, and that workers should be able to live. Some factory workers were dissatisfied with the treatment they received from the factory management in the past, especially the way they were treated, but in the end, the workers all agreed that in the future, labor and capital should work together to develop production and no longer pursue the past. "Let the past be the past" was the consensus. Everyone agreed that labor and capital should act in accordance with the treaty agreed upon by both parties, that workers should have labor discipline in the factory, and that they should obey the factory's command in production. Today we want to hear your opinions. Comrades Peng Zhen and Mayor Ye, when talking about building a new democratic society and building the cause of Beiping, both specifically stated that the proletariat is the leading class, and only it can bear this leadership responsibility. However, in the production of a private factory, the workers should obey the command of the factory director, should have labor discipline, and both workers and factory directors should abide by government laws and regulations, and labor-capital relations should be good. Then, the representatives of each factory spoke one after another on the theme of restoring and developing production. They talked about the current production situation, the difficulties, and the various issues of how to restore and develop industry. Since the liberation of Beiping, the industrial sector of Beiping has also been liberated, and the current favorable conditions for developing production are already in place. Mr. Chen Yintang, manager of Dahua Kiln Company, compared the current production of his factory with that before liberation: First of all, in terms of output, the factory produced 20 kilns in nine months last year, and five kilns in March this year alone. In April, eight kilns can be produced in one month, and the plan is to produce seventeen kilns per month in the second half of the year. Moreover, the quality of the finished products has also improved compared to before, while the number of workers has only doubled. Now, merchants from Tianjin are also coming to place orders. Secondly, he talked about how he organized a factory affairs management committee in the factory. When he has problems that he cannot solve, he consults with the employees, and as a result, the labor-capital cooperation is very good. This is an important reason for the increase in the factory's production. Mr. Sun Xueling of Fuxing Flour Mill talked about how the factory's raw materials and sales were very good and he was very satisfied. Because the imperialists and bureaucratic capitalists who oppressed private enterprises no longer exist, urban-rural relations have been opened up, transportation has been greatly improved, and the democratic government is strongly supporting production, our affairs are much easier to handle than in the past. The conditions for rapidly restoring and developing production are very good. Then, many other factory owners talked about the recovery and development of production after liberation, and put forward some existing problems that need to be solved. After speaking on this aspect, Comrade Peng Zhen asked everyone again to speak out everything they wanted to say in the spirit of "knowing without saying, saying without saying," especially the problems that everyone felt were difficult to handle and needed to be discussed and resolved together. The meeting gradually went deeper. Based on the opinions expressed by everyone, the following problems were summarized, and Comrade Peng Zhen gave answers separately. The first is the issue of labor and capital, which includes wages, worker welfare, factory management, labor-capital contracts, and other issues. Many factory owner representatives proposed that workers demanded higher wages, and the factory management allowed increases. Factory owners reflected the situation of extremely inconsistent wages in each factory, and the owner of Huaxing Factory hoped that the government would have unified regulations. Pu Jiexu, the representative of Zhenbei Tannery, proposed that wage issues should be resolved reasonably based on the specific circumstances of both labor and capital. Chen Yintang of Dahua Kiln viewed these issues as "labor-capital should both benefit, not labor-capital antagonism." Some factory owners said: Labor-capital antagonism causes headaches for both sides, and wages in each factory cannot be forced to be unified due to different capital conditions. Everyone also reached a consensus on this point. Comrade Peng Zhen pointed out: The workers are the masters, but the factory directors, managers, and the industrial sector they represent are also masters, but the workers are the leaders among these masters, but the workers in the factory must still obey the factory director's command in production. Speaking here, someone asked, will the workers settle accounts with us? Comrade Peng Zhen replied: In the past, there were incidents of settling accounts with industry and commerce in the land reform in the countryside. That was a violation of the Party's policy, it was wrong, and it has long been corrected. Now, it is not allowed to settle accounts in factories and shops. He said: If we agreed with the workers and shop assistants to settle accounts, wouldn't we have settled accounts long ago! Chen, the factory director of Dahua Kiln Company, said that they organized a factory affairs management committee, and the result was very good. Comrade Peng Zhen said: Factory owners who are willing can try it out to see if it is convenient for you to use, but it is not necessary to force it. According to the experience of state-owned enterprises, things go smoothly when the factory director cares about the lives of the workers and frequently consults with them on matters; otherwise, there will be many obstacles. These experiences can also be introduced to you for trial use. In short, it is necessary for labor and capital to be both suitable and mutually beneficial, and it is impossible to work if only one side benefits.
    Second, there are the issues of raw materials and sales. In the machinery, leather, and match industries, there is a shortage of raw materials. For example, the machinery and leather industries hope to purchase steel from the Northeast and raw hides from Hebei, Henan, and Xuzhou, and request the government to help solve the problem. In terms of sales: the carpet industry has only had two exports since liberation, and many small factories have no way to export their goods themselves. The machinery manufacturing industry said that their current difficulty is that they do not know the needs of the rural areas. The general problem is that factories produce blindly and without planning, so the goods produced are not necessarily suitable for the needs, and what is needed is often not available. Therefore, Wang Xiangchen of Cixing Iron Factory suggested that the government regularly investigate the supply and demand situation in various places and inform the industrial sector at any time to guide production. Everyone also agreed with this opinion. Comrade Peng Zhen also pointed out: In the future, the main market for Beiping's industrial sector will be domestic, supplying rural people with cheap and high-quality industrial products. After we cross the river, the market will be even broader. Now, we hope that all industries will recommend some people who are familiar with the situation and work with the government to solve the sales problem.
    Third, there is the issue of funds. Some people have proposed that they have little funds and hope that the bank will lend them funds. Comrade Peng Zhen specifically reminded everyone: Public loans are limited, but there is a lot of floating capital in the market. Some people even use this floating capital for speculative trading, disrupting the market; the most effective way to absorb this part of the floating capital into production is to enable them to make money from investment in industry, and the dividends obtained can be more than the interest earned from bank deposits.
    　　　　Earning money by investing in development production brings both fame and fortune; engaging in speculation results in the loss of both fame and fortune.
    In the liberated areas, wealthy people who earn money from investing in development production will gain both fame and fortune; engaging in speculation will result in the loss of both fame and fortune. Now, the key is to crack down on speculative merchants; but the main thing is for you to manage your industries well so that investors can get "dividends," so that you can absorb floating capital to expand your capital.
    Fourth, there is the issue of taxation. For the sake of long-term interests in the future, factory owners and representatives all believe that it is appropriate to pay a certain amount of tax to the state. However, everyone pointed out that the current industry is still in the process of recovery and is still very fragile, and hopes that the government will take care of it. Zhao Zishang, Director of the Finance Bureau of the Beiping Municipal People's Government, pointed out that the principle of our tax policy is that industry is lighter than commerce, heavy industry is lighter than light industry, and manufacturing necessary goods is lighter than manufacturing luxury goods. The new tax rules have not yet been written into articles and will be formally decided after investigation and research.
    　　　　The Communist Party's policy is: taking into account both public and private interests, benefiting both labor and capital, improving urban-rural relations, and improving internal and external relations.
    After explaining these issues, Comrade Peng Zhen then emphasized that we have four friends and three enemies. The friends are the workers, peasants, liberal bourgeoisie, and intellectual petty bourgeoisie; the enemies are imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism. Chairman Mao instructed that our Communist Party's policy is to take into account both public and private interests, benefit both labor and capital, urban-rural relations must be handled well, and internal and external relations must be handled well. If one aspect is handled wrong, it will not work. This is our line, and all Chinese Communists must abide by it, and no deviation is allowed. Then he said, some of you are not saying that you "don't understand" the Communist Party's "bottom line"? This is our "bottom line," this is our central government, Chairman Mao has already determined it, and announced it many times.
    After Comrade Peng Zhen spoke, Mr. Pu Jiexu said that he had a more thorough understanding of the Communist Party's policy from this, and we can more confidently work hard to restore and develop production. The meeting lasted for a total of eight hours. It ended successfully at ten o'clock at night.

　　中共北平市委会
  　邀集私营工厂主座谈
  　商讨有关恢复发展生产问题
    工人阶级是领导阶级；但在私厂中工人应服从厂长指挥，应有劳动纪律。
    厂长关心工人生活，有事和工人勤商量，办事就顺利；反之即蹩扭很多。
    【本报讯】本报记者艾方报道：中共北平市委会继十九日召集公营工厂职工代表、厂长座谈，二十日召集私营工厂职工代表座谈后，复于廿一日下午二时召集私营工业资本家座谈，商讨恢复与发展生产问题。到有机器业、面粉业、染织业、地毯业、火柴业、窑业、制革业等廿八家厂主代表蒲洁修等廿九人。首由市长叶剑英同志代表市委宣布开会。他说：共产党是按照党的政策办事的，是依靠党的政策来实现对各方面领导的。中国共产党无论在经济、政治、文化各方面都有一定的政策。我们共产党在北平，经济上怎样来实现领导呢？那就是依靠毛主席所规定的“发展生产、繁荣经济、公私兼顾、劳资两利”的方针，依靠对于这一方针的正确贯彻和实现。我们市委会，今天邀集诸位来，就是为了征求和交换这方面的意见。接着，彭真同志说：我们前天召集了公营工厂的厂方和工人代表解决他们如何解决相互关系迅速恢复和发展生产的问题。因私营企业中，也存在有许多问题亟待解决。昨天我们召集了私营工厂工人代表开了个座谈会，听取了他们的意见，在那个会上，工人诉了一些过去的痛苦，提出了很多有关发展生产和劳资关系的意见。他们的意见很好，最后人家一致认为劳资要两利，资本家要能赚钱，工人要能生活。有些工厂的工人对厂方过去对他们的待遇特别是所受的气是不满意的，但最后工人都同意今后劳资要好好协力发展生产，不再追究既往。“过去的让他过去”算了。大家都认为劳资应按双方协定的条约办事，在工厂中工人应有劳动纪律，在生产上服从厂方指挥。今天我们想听听诸位的意见。彭真同志与叶市长在谈到建设新民主主义的社会、建设北平的事业中，均特别说明无产阶级是领导阶级，也只有他才能负此领导责任。但是，在一个私营工厂的生产中，工人应当服从厂长指挥，应有劳动纪律，工人厂长都要遵守政府法令，劳资关系要搞好。接着各厂代表大家围绕着恢复与发展生产的主题纷纷发表意见。大家谈出了目前生产的情况，困难以及如何恢复与发展工业的各项问题。自北平解放以来，北平的产业界也是被解放了的，当前已经具备了发展生产的有利条件。大华窑业公司经理陈荫棠先生，把其工厂目前的生产与解放前作了个对比：首先在产量方面，该厂去年九个月出二十窑，今年三月份，一个月就出了五窑，四月份一个月即可出八窑，计划下半年一月出十七窑。并且，成品质量也较前提高了，而工人则不过增加了一倍。现在天津的商人，也都纷纷来订货。其次，讲到他在厂里组织了个厂务管理委员会，他有办不通的事，就和职工商议，结果，劳资双方合作的很好，这是该厂生产提高的重要原因。福兴面粉厂孙学凌先生谈到该厂原料、销路都很好，甚为满意。因为现在压迫私人企业的帝国主义与官僚资本已不复存在，城乡关系打通，交通相当改善，民主政府大力扶持生产，我们的事是比过去好办的多了。迅速地恢复与发展生产，条件是很好的。接着又有很多厂主讲了解放后生产恢复发展的状况，并提出了些现存问题需要解决。在这一方面发言之后，彭真同志复请大家本“知无不言，言无不尽”的精神说出心里所要说的一切，特别是大家感到不好办，需要共同商讨解决的问题。会议逐步走向深入，根据大家所发表的意见，综合有以下几个问题，并由彭真同志分别予以解答。首先是劳资问题，这包括工资、工人福利、工厂管理、劳资合同等问题。许多工厂主代表提出了工人要求提高工资，厂方允许增加。工资或增资困难的情况各厂主反映了各厂工资极不一致，华兴厂主并希望政府有统一规定。振北制革厂代表蒲洁修提出应根据劳资双方具体情况，合理解决工资问题。大华窑业陈荫棠对这些问题的看法是“要劳资两利，不是劳资对立”。有的厂主说：劳资对立起来双方都伤脑筋，各厂工资因资本条件不同也不能强求统一。这一点大家意见也取得了一致。彭真同志指出：工人是主人了，但今天在座的各位厂长经理及所代表的产业界也是主人，不过工人是这些主人中的领导者，但工人在工厂内生产还是要服从厂长指挥。讲到这里有人问，工人会不会清算我们？彭真同志答：过去乡村在土改中曾有过清算工商业的事情发生，那是违反党的政策的，错误的，早已纠正了。现在无论工厂商店都不准清算。他说：诸位试想，如果我们赞成工人店员清算，岂不早清算了！大华窑业公司陈厂长说他们组织了厂务管理委员会，结果很好。彭真同志说：厂主愿意的可以试验试验，看你们运用起来是否便利，但不必勉强。据公营企业中的经验，凡是厂长关心工人生活，有事和工人勤商议的就办事顺利，反之，即蹩扭很多。这些经验，也可介绍给你们试用。总之要劳资两合适两有利才行，只是一方有利，是无论如何也行不通的。
    第二、是原料和销路问题。在机器、制革、火柴等业都感到原料缺乏，如机器业及制革业等都希望购到东北的钢铁，冀鲁豫河南和徐州的生皮，请求政府帮助解决。销路方面：地毯业在解放后只有过两次出口，许多小工厂的货自己没法出口。机器制造业说，他们现在的困难是不知道农村需要的情况。总的问题是工厂盲目生产，无计划性，因之生产出来的商品不一定适合需要，而需要的又往往买不到。因之，慈型铁工厂王向宸建议政府经常调查各地供求情况，随时告知产业界，指导生产。大家也同意这意见。彭真同志并指出：今后北平产业界的主要市场是对内的，是供给乡村人民以价廉物美的工业品。我们渡江后，市场将更广了。现在希望各行各业，推荐些熟悉情况的人和政府一起解决销路问题。
    第三、是资金问题，有的提出资金少，希望银行贷给资金。彭真同志特别提醒大家：公家的贷款是有限的，而目前市场的游资却很多，有些人并用这些游资搞投机买卖，扰乱市场；应当把这一部份游资吸收到生产方面来，使这些游资转向生产方面的最有效办法，是使他们在工业方面的投资能赚到钱，所得红利能比在银行存款所得利息多些。
    　　　　投资在发展生产中赚钱，会名利双收；从事投机的结果，则是名利
    　　双失。
    在解放区内，有钱的人要从投资在发展生产中赚钱，会名利双收；从事投机的结果则是名利双失。现在关键一方面是打击投机商人；但主要是各位把产业经营好，使投资者能得“红利”，即可吸收游资扩大你们的资本。
    第四、是税收问题。为了今后长远利益，给国家纳一定的税，各厂主和代表都认为是应当的。但大家提出目前工业尚在恢复当中，还很脆弱的情况下，希望政府照顾。北平市人民政府财政局长赵子尚同志指出我们税收政策的原则是工业比商业轻，重工业比轻工业轻，制造必需品工业比制造奢侈品的工业轻。目前新的税则尚未制成条文，经过调查研究，然后正式决定。
    　　　　共产党的政策是：公私兼顾，劳资两利，搞好城乡关系，搞好内外
    　　关系。
    在解释了这些问题后，彭真同志接着着重指出我们有四个朋友，三个敌人。朋友是工人、农民、自由资产阶级和知识分子小资产阶级；敌人是帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义。毛主席指示我们共产党的政策是公私兼顾，劳资两利，城乡关系要搞好，内外关系要搞好，有一面搞错了都不行，这乃是我们的路线，是一切中国共产党员都要遵守的，偏一点都不行的，接着他说，诸位中有的人不是说“不摸”共产党的“底”么，这就是我们的“底”，这是我们的中央、毛主席早已定好，而且宣布过多少次的“底”。
    彭真同志发言以后，蒲洁修先生说，从此对共产党政策了解得更透澈，我们更可安心努力恢复与发展生产了。会议共历时八小时。夜十点圆满结束。
