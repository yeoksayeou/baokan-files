　　Strengthening May Day and May Fourth Reporting
  　This Newspaper Invites Correspondents from Factories and Schools for a Discussion
    [This Newspaper's Dispatch] To strengthen the reporting on the "May Fourth" Youth Day, the liaison department of this newspaper held a symposium for correspondents from schools in the Ping City yesterday (the 20th). Thirty-four people from nineteen units, including Tsinghua University, Peking University, Yenching University, and the Girls' Affiliated High School, attended. The correspondents from various schools unanimously believed that: In addition to reporting the situation of each school's commemoration of "May Fourth" in a timely manner, the reporting on "May Fourth" should use practical issues to explain the significant differences between this year's "May Fourth" and previous years. Secondly, commemorating "May Fourth" should broadly and deeply reflect the learning methods, experiences, and gains of various schools, learning units, or individuals, raise problems encountered in learning, and connect with their own lives, ideological changes, etc. Each correspondent should vigorously organize historical materials related to the "May Fourth" Movement: visit workers, professors, and students who personally participated in the May Fourth Movement, and ask them to write articles. A Peking University student said: "During the Kuomintang's rule, the special agents tried every means to prohibit it. Wherever students commemorated 'May Fourth', martial law was imposed. Now that we are liberated, we must properly commemorate our own festival and reflect these situations." Guo Fu, an old worker at Peking University who personally participated in the "May Fourth" Movement, said: "I can provide you with materials about the situation of the student movement at that time. Although I don't write well, I am willing to write."

　　加强五一、五四报导
  　本报邀工厂学校通讯员座谈
    【本报讯】为了加强对“五四”青年节的报导，本社通联科特于昨（二十）日召开平市各学校通讯员座谈会。到会有清华、北大、燕京、女附中等十九单位三十四人。各校通讯员一致认为：“五四”方面的报导，除及时报导各校纪念“五四”的情形外：须以实际问题说明今年“五四”和往年不同的重大意义。其次是纪念“五四”要广泛深入的反映各校、各学习单位或某一个人的学习方法、经验、收获，提出学习中遇到的问题，并联系自己的生活，思想转变等。各个通讯员要大力组织有关“五四”运动的史料：访问曾亲身参加五四运动的工友、教授、学生，请他们写文章。北大同学说：“在国民党统治时期，特务们想尽办法来禁止，同学们在那里纪念‘五四’，那里便戒严；现在解放啦，咱们得好好地纪念一下自己节日，并将这些情况反映出去。”亲身参加过“五四”运动的北大老工友郭富同志说：“那时候学生运动的情形，我可以供给大家材料，虽然我写不好，但也愿意写。”
