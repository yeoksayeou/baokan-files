　　Today's Dictionary
    Topping—When the branches and stems of cotton grow to a certain extent, in order to promote early maturity of the cotton, the "wild branches" are removed, which is called topping. However, in recent years, some farms have proven through experiments that in the cotton-producing areas of North China, planting Si-type cotton without topping yields no less than topping, which can save labor.
    Night Soil—That is human excrement and urine.
    Base Fertilizer—This refers to farmers spreading fertilizer in the field before sowing, and after plowing and harrowing, mixing the fertilizer with the soil, and then planting crops. Applying fertilizer in this way is called base fertilizer.
