　　The tactic of maintaining colonial rule by dividing the internal unity of oppressed nations is a common old trick used by imperialist countries in colonies and semi-colonies. Britain in India and the Middle East; the United States in the Philippines; France in Vietnam; the Netherlands in Indonesia, have all adopted or are adopting this method to deal with national liberation movements. The Karen rebellion in Burma since February last year is a recent example. On January 4, 1948, under the pressure of a general strike by the people of Burma, the British Labour government "allowed" Burma to become "independent" and handed over power to Thakin Nu's Socialist government. This was partly because Thakin Nu had sold out the interests of the Burmese nation in the Anglo-Burmese Treaty signed with Attlee, and partly because Britain at that time needed Thakin Nu to act as a watchdog for British companies in Burma, suppressing the increasingly high revolutionary movement of the Burmese people.

　　However, the British colonialists were not at ease with this, and what they demanded was still complete control over the colony. People remember that Britain once instigated Aung San, the former chairman of the Burmese Freedom League, to exclude the Communists from the Freedom League, thus splitting the Burmese independence movement; on the other hand, it instigated U Saw, the head of the so-called Burmese Patriotic Party, a loyal British lackey, to assassinate Aung San. After U Saw became a victim of the British colonialists' divisive policy, a new loyal British lackey, So Ba U Gyi, the chairman of the so-called All-Karen League, was used to replace U Saw. But this time it was done by means of open rebellion.

　　The Karen people are one of the ethnic minorities in Burma, with a population of about one-tenth of Burma's 17 million people; they are scattered in southern Burma from Arakan to the Burmese-Malayan border, mainly in the Irrawaddy Delta. The Karen people believe in Buddhism, animism, and Christianity. During the British rule in Burma, they actively provoked hatred between the Karen and Burmese people (11 million, accounting for the vast majority of the Burmese population), cultivated upper-class Karen elements who were used by the British, and made the Karen people account for a large proportion of the Burmese indigenous military police. This tradition has been maintained until recently. Before the Karen rebellion last year, about half of the Burmese Defense Forces were Karen people.

　　The Karen rebellion was instigated by Colonel Tulloch, a veteran British intelligence agent, and certain British priests. The Burmese Foreign Ministry announced this in mid-last year. However, the Thakin Nu government, fearing to offend its masters too much, dropped the case.

　　In February 1948, when the Thakin Nu government was repeatedly defeated in the anti-people war, So Ba U Gyi, under the direction of the British, grandly raised the issue of so-called Karen autonomy and the establishment of Karenistan (i.e., the Karen state). However, Thakin Nu responded to his competitor on the pro-British and anti-people stage by weakening the Karen troops in the government army and increasing the training of Burmese troops. On September 1 of the same year, So Ba U Gyi's All-Karen League finally launched a rebellion, occupied Moulmein, the third largest city in Burma, Taungoo (a railway town between Moulmein and Yangon), and several other towns in the Irrawaddy Delta (west of Yangon), and advanced towards Yangon. Later, although So Ba U Gyi held negotiations with Thakin Nu, no results were achieved.

　　In January 1949, So Ba U Gyi launched a second rebellion, using the incident of the Karen church in Mergui (the southernmost tip of Burma) being bombed by military police. Due to the mutiny of a large number of Karen troops in the government army, So Ba U Gyi was able to occupy Insein, only ten miles north of Yangon, and once occupied Yangon Station and Tarmwe, a suburb of Yangon. Thakin Nu hurriedly transferred troops from central Burma to defend Yangon and surrounded the main force of the Karen army led by So Ba U Gyi in Insein. However, the major cities in central Burma, which were short of troops, including Yamethin, Pyinmana, Taungdwingyi, Meiktila, Thazi, and Mandalay, the second largest city in Burma, were occupied by the local mutinying Karen troops of the government army in February and March. As a result, the Karen army cut off the transportation between central and southern Burma, isolating Yangon and putting the Thakin Nu government in an embarrassing situation.

　　In February, in a critical situation, Thakin Nu extended his hand to his British masters for help. This time, the British replied: "The British government does not want to consider the loan issue until the situation in Burma is stabilized." When the Karen troops occupied Mandalay, the British colonialists were overjoyed. An Associated Press report from London on March 27 stated: An official in charge stated that Burma would return to the British Commonwealth within a year. This sentence inadvertently revealed the thoughts of the British imperialists.

　　The British Labour government's policy towards the colonies is essentially no different from its predecessor, the Conservative Party. The difference is that the revolutionary movement of the colonial people striving for independence and freedom, which grew up during World War II and developed vigorously after the war, made it impossible for the ruling classes of the suzerain states to rule as they did in the past. The colonial people are determined not to be enslaved again. The situation in Burma is also the same. The Burmese people have accumulated strength in the anti-Japanese guerrilla war and the post-war liberation movement, are gradually recognizing the divisive conspiracies of the British colonialists, breaking away from the influence of Thakin Nu and So Ba U Gyi, and embarking on the path of striving for true independence and freedom.

### 缅甸克仑族事件

1949-04-15

专栏：国际常识

　　缅甸克仑族事件
    用分裂被压迫民族的内部团结来维持其殖民统治，是帝国主义国家在殖民地及半殖民地中惯常使用的老手法。英国在印度、中东；美国在菲律宾；法国在越南；荷兰在印尼，都曾采用过或正采用着这种手法来对付民族解放运动。去年二月以来缅甸克仑族叛乱事件就是最近的一个例子。一九四八年一月四日，英国工党政府在全缅人民大罢工的压力下，“允许”了缅甸“独立”，把政权交给达钦努的社会党政府。这一方面是因为达钦努在和艾德礼签订的英缅条约中，把缅甸民族的利益拍卖净尽，另一方面也中于英国在当时正需要达钦努替它作为英国公司在缅甸的看门狗，来压迫缅甸人民日益高涨的革命运动。
    但是，英国殖民者并不就此放心，他们所要求的仍然是对殖民地的完全统治。人们记得：英国曾经一方面唆使前缅甸自由同盟主席昂山把共产党排斥出自由同盟，这样来分裂缅甸独立运动；另一方面又唆使英国的忠实走狗——所谓缅甸爱国党的头子宇素，暗杀了昂山。在宇素成为英殖民者分裂政策的牺牲品以后，新的英国忠实走狗——所谓全克仑族联盟的主席索巴宇吉，便被用来代替宇素。但这一次用的是公开叛乱的办法。
    克仑族是缅甸境内少数民族之一，人口约占全缅一千七百万人中的十分之一；散居于南缅自阿拉干至缅甸马来亚边境一带，主要是在伊洛瓦底江三角洲。克仑族信仰佛教、拜物教及基督教。英国统治缅甸期间积极挑拨克仑族与缅族（一千一百万人，占缅甸人口绝大多数）之间的仇恨，培植被英国利用的克仑族上层分子，使克仑族人在缅甸土著军警中占很大比重。这种传统曾一直保持到最近。在去年克仑族叛乱以前，缅甸国防军中就有一半左右是克仑族人。
    克仑族的叛乱，是英国老有经验的特务杜利克上校和某些英国神父所指使的。缅甸外交部曾于去年中旬把这件事公布出来。但害怕过分得罪其主子的达钦努政府，又把这一特务案不了了之。
    一九四八年二月，正是达钦努政府在反人民战争中屡遭失败之时，索巴宇吉在英方指使下，堂皇地提出了所谓克仑族自治和建立克仑斯坦（即克仑国）问题。但达钦努却以削弱政府军中的克仑族部队和增训缅族军队来回答他在亲英反人民舞台上的竞争者。至同年九月一日，索巴宇吉的全克仑族同盟终于掀起了叛乱、占据了缅甸第三大城毛淡棉、大通（毛淡棉通仰光的铁路城镇），及伊洛瓦底江三角洲（仰光以西）的若干其他城镇，并向仰光推进。其后索巴宇吉虽与达钦努进行过谈判，但无结果。
    一九四九年一月，索巴宇吉借墨吉镇（缅甸最南端）克仑人教堂被宪兵投弹事件，发动了第二次叛乱。由于政府军中大批克仑族部队的哗变、索巴宇吉得以占领仰光以北仅十哩的英山，并一度占领仰光车站及仰光近郊的当明，达钦努急忙自缅甸中部抽调军队保卫仰光，并将索巴宇吉亲率的克仑军主力包围于英山，但兵力空虚的中缅甸各主要城市——包括也美生、平蛮、倘古、密克德拉、沙什及缅甸第二大城曼德勒，却于二三月间被当地哗变的政府军克仑族部队所占。于是克仑军切断了中南缅交通，陷仰光于孤立，使达钦努政府处于狼狈的境地。
    二月间形势紧急，达钦努向其英国主子伸出了乞援的手，这一次英国人回答他说：“在缅甸情况获得稳定之前，英政府不欲考虑贷款问题。”当克仑族部队占领曼德勒时，英殖民者兴高采烈。美联社三月二十七日伦敦消息称：有一位负责官员表示缅甸将在一年之内重返不列颠联邦。这句话无意中把英帝国主义者的心事和盘托出了。
    英国工党政府对殖民地的政策，本质上与它的前身保守党并无区别。所不同的是，在第二次世界大战时期成长起来并在战后有蓬勃发展的殖民地人民争取独立自由的革命运动，使得宗主国统治阶级不可能象过去那样统治下去了。殖民地人民已决不愿再受奴役了。缅甸的情形也是这样。缅甸人民在抗日游击战争以及战后解放运动中积蓄了力量，正逐渐认清着英国殖民者的分裂阴谋，摆脱达钦努和索巴宇吉之流的影响，走上真正独立自由的奋斗道路。    【新华社北平十三日电】
