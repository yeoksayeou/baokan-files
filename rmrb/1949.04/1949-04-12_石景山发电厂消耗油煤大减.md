Shijingshan Power Plant
Greatly Reduces Oil and Coal Consumption

[Ping City News] The staff and engineers of the Shijingshan Power Plant have united and worked hard to overcome difficulties, achieving great success in their work. (1) Coal consumption per kilowatt-hour of electricity generated is 1.076 kilograms; compared with the power generation efficiency in the same month last year, 2,532 tons of coal were saved. Compared with the best power generation efficiency in the past, 245 tons of coal were also saved. The coal used in March was of very poor quality, with a heat content that was 10% lower than the average for the previous year. Therefore, its real power generation efficiency saved 3,664 tons of coal (23.3%) compared with the efficiency in the same month last year, and 1,928 tons of coal (13%) compared with the best power generation efficiency in the past.
    (2) Oil consumption per 1,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity generated was 0.0942 kilograms, slightly exceeding the previous highest record.
    　　　　　Low-pressure furnace and other machine efficiency　Breaks all previous records
    (3) No. 6 generator, the first experimental product of Mitsubishi Corporation of Japan, suffered from many problems during the Kuomintang rule. The maximum load it could carry was 22,000 kilowatts. After liberation, the record in February was 22,800 kilowatts, and in March, a record of 23,500 kilowatts was achieved, lasting for eight minutes, and it is still operating to generate electricity.
    (4) The low-pressure furnace is the boiler with the lowest capacity in the plant. In March, three furnace units and one hand-fired furnace were tested. The predetermined maximum load was 4,000 kilowatts, which was already an unprecedented record before liberation. However, thanks to the efforts of the firemen, it was able to carry 5,500 kilowatts.　　　　　　　　　(Wu Tongxian)
    [Another Dispatch] On April 2, the foundry of the repair division of the Shijingshan Power Plant started its furnace. After completing all their work that day, the workers worked together to make 30 coal powder discharge nozzle ingots. After finishing, there was still half an hour before the end of the shift, so everyone cleaned up the sand and all the foundry tools. During the Kuomintang era, workers would rest after a furnace was started, and the cleanup would be done the next day.

### 石景山发电厂消耗油煤大减

　　石景山发电厂
  　消耗油煤大减
    【平市讯】石景山发电厂职工与工程师们团结努力，克服困难，工作中获得巨大成绩。（一）发电每度耗煤一·○七六公斤；与去年同月的发电效率比较，省煤二五三二吨。与历来最好的发电效率比较，也省煤二四五吨。三月份所用的煤，质量很次，含热量较去年度平均要低到百分之十。所以它真正的发电效率，要比去年同月的效率省煤三六六四吨（百分之二三·三）。较历来最好的发电效率省煤一九二八吨（百分之十三）。
    （二）发电每千度耗油○·○九四二公斤，略微突破以往最高的纪录。
    　　　　　低压炉等机器效能　突破历来纪录
    （三）日本三菱公司第一部试验成品的六号机，在国民党统治时期是多灾多病的，最多能带的纪录是二二○○○千瓦；解放后二月份的纪录是二二八○○千瓦，到三月份再造成二三五○○千瓦的纪录，维持了八分钟，现在一直开动着发电。
    （四）低压炉是本厂能力最低的锅炉，三月份曾试验三个机炉，一个手烧炉，预定最多能带四○○○千瓦，这已是解放前未有的纪录了；但在烧火工人努力下，竟带到了五五○○千瓦。　　　　　　　　　（吴统先）
    【又讯】石景山发电厂修理股翻砂房四月二日开炉，当天工人们把所有工作干完后，又齐心努力做了泄煤粉的嘴子信条三十个。做完后，离下班还有半点，大家便又整理砂子与一切翻砂工具。在国民党时，炉一开完就休息了，第二天才作整理工作。
