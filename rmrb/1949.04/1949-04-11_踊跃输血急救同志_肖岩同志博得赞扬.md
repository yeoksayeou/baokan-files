　　Actively Donating Blood to Rescue Comrades
  　Comrade Xiao Yan Receives Praise
    [Ping City News] Comrade Cao Lei, political director of the 431st Regiment of the 48th Army of the Fourth Field Army of the Northeast, was critically ill and in urgent need of a blood transfusion to save his life. Comrade Xiao Yan, the military control committee's liaison officer stationed in the hospital, upon hearing this, unhesitatingly donated 200 cc of blood. This rapidly improved Comrade Cao's condition. Although Comrade Xiao Yan felt somewhat dizzy after the blood donation, he continued to persevere in his work. All convalescents and staff in the hospital praised him unanimously. It was suggested that in addition to taking good care of Comrade Xiao's health, his actions should be commended in the newspaper.
