　　Beiping Dispatch: In the university reform endeavor, the university education departments, tasked with cultivating new teachers for the new democratic state, must be reformed first to lay the educational foundation needed by the new China. The Cultural and Educational Committee and the faculty and students of various university education departments share this understanding, hence the proposal to hold a symposium on curriculum issues in university education departments. This session was convened by the Education Department of the Teachers College, and was held at Leyu Hall of the Teachers College at 2:00 PM on the 23rd of this month. Those invited to attend included Zhang Zonglin and Hao Renchu from the Cultural Management Committee, Chao Zhefu and Sun Wenshu from the Education Department of the North China People's Government, democrat Shen Tilan, Zhu Zhixian, faculty and students from education departments of various universities, and over a hundred scholars concerned about reforming Chinese education. Lu Shiying, Chairman of the Education Department of the Teachers College, explained the significance of the symposium. First, Zhang Zonglin spoke, elaborating that education is a weapon of politics, and educators should arm their minds to realize the goal of "education serving politics." The past view that education was in a detached position was a serious mistake. He then stated that the research and implementation of education should be coordinated with the needs of time and space, and materials that are repetitive, have erroneous viewpoints, and unscientific content should be discarded. Afterwards, the speakers were very enthusiastic and deeply agreed with the point that "education should serve politics." In addition, there was extensive exchange of views on the principles for setting university education department curricula, as well as issues related to the goals, timelines, and internships of the curriculum. Since the new curriculum plan requires detailed discussion, it was unanimously decided to elect a committee of nine standing committee members to specifically study this issue. The committee consists of the heads of the education departments of five universities: China University, Teachers College, Peking University, Yenching University, and Fu Jen Catholic University, as well as representatives from the Education Department of the North China People's Government, the Education Department of the Cultural Management Committee, the Beiping Municipal Education Bureau, and a democrat. The symposium adjourned at 6:00 PM.

　　平市各大学教育系
  　座谈课程问题
    【平市讯】在大学改革事业中，负有为新民主主义国家培养新师资任务之大学教育系，尤须首先改造，以奠立新中国所需的教育基础。文教会及各大学教育系师生均有此种认识，因而有举行大学教育系课程问题座谈会之议。此次召集者为师范大学教育系，于本月二十三日午后二时假师大乐育堂举行，被邀出席者，有文管会张宗麟、郝人初，华北人民政府教育部晁哲甫、孙文淑、民主人士沈体兰、朱智贤、各大学教育系师生以及关心改造中国教育之学者共百余人。师大教育系鲁世英主席，说明座谈意义后，首请张宗麟讲话，张氏详释教育乃政治之武器，教育者应武装头脑，以实现“教育服务于政治”之目的。过去认为教育处于超然地位，乃是一种严重的错误。继申述教育之研究及设施，应配合时间及空间之需要，其教材重复，观点错误与非科学之内容，均应予以废除。其后发言者甚为踊跃，对“教育应服务于政治”一点，均深切赞同。此外对于大学教育系课程厘订原则以及有关课程之目标年限以及实习等问题，均曾广泛交换意见。嗣以新课程方案须经详细研讨，乃经一致决议，推选常务委员九人组成委员会，专门研究本问题。该委员会由华大、师大、北大、燕京、辅仁五大学教育系主任及华北人民政府教育部、文管会教育部、北平人民政府教育局与民主人士代表各一人构成。座谈至六时余始散。
