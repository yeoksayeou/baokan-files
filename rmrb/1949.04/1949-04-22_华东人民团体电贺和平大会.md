Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 20th: The East China Liberated Area Peasants' Association, the East China Liberated Area Youth Federation, and the East China Liberated Area Women's Federation have sent a telegram to the Paris World Congress of Supporters of Peace, congratulating the opening of the congress. The original text of the telegram is as follows:

To the World Congress of Supporters of Peace in Paris (via Xinhua News Agency): We celebrate the opening of your congress and wish you success. The people of all countries in the world do not want war anymore; only a few warmongers hope for war. The forces of peace not only have a broad foundation but also have a strong and irresistible power. Based on our past struggle experience, the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan defeated Japanese imperialism, and the more than three-year War of Liberation shattered the countless offensives and the most brutal key offensives of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, who were fully supported by American imperialism, and won complete victory. Now we are about to cross the Yangtze River and liberate all of China, proving how great the people's power is and how small and contemptible the imperialists and their running dogs are. We believe that as long as the peace-loving people of the world can unite around the socialist Soviet Union and fight steadfastly, the danger of war can be overcome, and victory will surely belong to the people. The world is moving towards the victory of peace, and your efforts have further increased the driving force. Our 50 million workers, peasants, youth, and women in East China express our respect for your efforts to fight for peace and are willing to fully support and fight to the end for world peace.

　　华东人民团体电贺和平大会
    【新华社济南二十日电】华东解放区农民联合会、华东解放区青年联合会、华东解放区妇女联合会顷致电巴黎世界拥护和平大会庆祝大会开幕。兹志其原电如下：新华社转巴黎世界拥护和平大会：庆祝你们的大会开幕，并预祝你们的成功。世界各国人民，是都不愿意再有战争的，希望战争的只是少数战争贩子。和平力量不但有广泛的基础，并且有雄厚不可抗拒的力量。根据我们过去斗争的经验，八年抗日战争，战败了日本帝国主义，三年多的解放战争，粉碎了美帝国主义全力支持的蒋介石匪帮的无数次的进攻，及最残酷的重点进攻，争取了全部胜利，现在就要渡过长江，解放全中国，证明人民力量是多么伟大，帝国主义及其走狗是多么渺小可鄙。我们相信，只要全世界爱好和平的人民，能团结在社会主义的苏联周围，坚定不懈的奋斗，战争危险定能克服，胜利一定属于人民，世界正在向和平的胜利迈进，你们的努力，更增加了推动的力量。我华东五千万工人、农民、青年、妇女对你们争取和平的努力表示敬意，并愿意全力拥护，为争取世界和平共同奋斗到底。
