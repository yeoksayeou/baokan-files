　　Kailuan Incident Comes to an End
    The just action of Tangshan workers protesting against the capitalists who only care about making money and disregard the lives of workers has achieved preliminary victory. The reasonable demands put forward by the workers, such as improving safety equipment and ensuring the safety of workers' lives, have been agreed to and guaranteed to be implemented by the factory. The Kailuan incident, which has been of great concern to all workers in North China and the broad masses of people, has largely come to an end. This shows that in a new democratic society, both capitalists and workers must conscientiously implement the policy of benefiting both labor and capital to develop production. The practice of disregarding the safety of workers' lives and only seeking profit for oneself is not only unacceptable to the broad working class and public opinion but also intolerable to government laws and decrees. This victory of the Tangshan workers is a practical lesson and a serious warning to those who attempt to exploit loopholes in the new democratic social system and seek illegal profits. It is a great comfort and encouragement to the working masses everywhere!
    The demand of the Kailuan Coal Mine workers to improve safety equipment is entirely reasonable. Because: First, it is absolutely necessary and is the most basic demand of the workers. Without certain safety measures, the lives of workers are precarious, so how can we talk about benefiting both labor and capital, or about increasing production? Second, it is possible to achieve this. The factory has the strength to improve this equipment. Since it is necessary and possible, the workers put it forward with confidence, received widespread support, and the firm support of the government, and thus achieved a preliminary victory. Party committees and governments in various places, especially comrades working in trade unions, should learn from the experience of the Tangshan issue, resolutely implement the policy of benefiting both labor and capital, and within the scope of possibility, should meet the reasonable demands of the workers. All trade union workers must be very concerned about the welfare of the workers, which can only benefit production. All measures that are necessary and possible to improve the lives of workers should be implemented in cooperation with all parties, and attention should be paid to the organization and education of the workers.
    The Kailuan tragedy teaches us that the working class must strengthen internal unity, strengthen the unity between workers and staff, study diligently, improve their awareness, implement the Party's labor policy, carry out production under the leadership of the Party, and strive to gradually realize their reasonable demands; in addition, we hope that the Tangshan People's Municipal Government should supervise the factory to fulfill its promises.

　　开滦事件告一段落
    唐山职工抗议资方只顾自己赚钱不顾工人死活的正义行动，已经得到初步胜利。工人提出的改进安全设备保障工人生命安全等合理的要求，已经厂方应允保证实行。为全华北工人及广大人民所热烈关怀的开滦事件大体上已告一段落。这说明在新民主主义社会里，资本家与工人双方都必须认真执行劳资两利发展生产的方针。那种不顾工人生命安全只图本身牟利的干法，不只为广大工人阶级及社会舆论所不许，而且为政府法令所不容。唐山工人这次的胜利，对那些妄图在新民主主义社会制度下钻空子想作违法牟利的人，是一个现实的教训和严重的警告；对于各地工人群众，则是一个莫大的安慰和鼓励！
    开滦煤矿工人要求改善安全设备，是完全合理的。因为：第一，这是十分必要的，是工人最起码的要求。没有一定的安全设置，工人的生命朝不保夕，还谈什么劳资两利，谈什么增加生产呢？第二，这是可能作到的。厂方有力量来改善这种设备。既系必要，又属可能，所以工人理直气壮的提出后，得到各方纷纷声援，和政府的坚决支持，因而获得了初步的胜利。各地党委、政府尤其是作工会工作的同志，都应接受这次唐山问题的经验，坚决贯彻执行劳资两利方针，在可能的范围内，应该满足工人的合理要求，一切工会工作者都要十分关心工人的福利，这对生产只有好处。凡属必要与可能改善工人生活的措施，都应协同各方设法予以实现，并十分注意对工人的组织与教育工作。
    开滦惨案教训我们，工人阶级必须加强内部团结，加强工人与职员之间的团结，认真学习，提高自己觉悟，贯彻党的劳动政策，在党的领导下，进行生产，并争取自己合理要求逐步实现；此外，我们希望唐山人民市政府更应监督厂方，实践自己的诺言。
