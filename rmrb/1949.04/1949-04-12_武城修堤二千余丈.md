(Jinan Electricity) During the spring plowing break, Wucheng completed over two thousand zhang of Wei River embankment repairs, ensuring that the same water volume as last year will not cause any danger. The county government had already made arrangements and preparations after the beginning of spring. In early March, all villages completed the organization of labor, the repair and purchase of tools, and the supply of food. Preliminary education on the significance of embankment repair, discipline, and protecting wheat seedlings and reducing land damage was also carried out. On March 16th, taking advantage of the gap between sending manure, harrowing, and the early stage of spring planting, construction began. The enthusiasm of all the laborers was extremely high, and the entire project was completed in just three days. This project mobilized 25,359 people and used 117,841 cubic meters of earth. The newly repaired embankment is three chi higher than the maximum water level. During the embankment repair, in order to enliven and encourage morale, the county headquarters, in addition to mobile propaganda about current affairs, also published sixteen door-panel newspapers, timely commending models and criticizing shortcomings, which further improved the enthusiasm of the embankment repair workers.
