　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 25th: The People's Liberation Army's million-strong army is crossing the river in full force, advancing rapidly, causing panic and chaos among all the remaining local reactionary governments in the southern provinces and cities. Shanghai, Hangzhou, Hankou, Changsha, Fuzhou, Chongqing and other places hurriedly announced martial law on the 22nd and 23rd. The Guangdong Kuomintang reactionary authorities announced that "the entire province is in a state of emergency." The Kuomintang garrison headquarters in Shanghai and Hankou launched "emergency public security regulations," stipulating "those who obstruct government orders and resist the government will be sentenced to death," "those who strike or slow down work will be sentenced to death," "those who incite student unrest will be sentenced to death," and other vicious killing provisions, attempting to suppress the people's struggle. The Chongqing Kuomintang reactionary authorities imposed daytime martial law throughout the 21st, dispatching military police and secret agents to prevent student demonstrations, and forcibly disbanded the "Chongqing Schools Joint Committee for the Struggle for Survival" on the 23rd. Jiang’s new nest in Xiamen, where he is fleeing, is said to have also established a garrison headquarters responsible for planning the "defense" of Xiamen. Hu Zongnan, director of the Kuomintang Xi'an Pacification Headquarters, and Dong Zhao, puppet governor of Shaanxi, fled Nanjing and returned to Xi'an on the 23rd. But no matter what steps these Kuomintang remnants take to struggle, if all the reactionary local governments in the South and Northwest do not bow to the people in accordance with the terms of the domestic peace agreement, the armed forces of the Chinese people—the People's Liberation Army—will soon bring their reactionary local rule to a final end, just like their rule in Nanjing in the past.

　　残余地方反动派惊慌混乱
  　又制定凶恶杀条妄图挣扎
    如不悔悟必将如南京反动统治一样的灭亡
    【新华社北平二十五日电】人民解放军百万大军全面渡江，迅速地向前推进，引起了所有残留在南方各省市的地方反动政府的惊慌和混乱。上海、杭州、汉口、长沙、福州、重庆等地都于二十二日二十三日仓皇宣布戒严。广东国民党反动当局宣布“全省处于紧急状态”。上海和汉口的国民党警备司令部发动了“紧急治安条例”，规定了“阻挠政令反抗政府者处死刑”、“罢工怠工者处死刑”、“鼓动学潮者处死刑”等等凶恶杀条，妄图镇压人民的斗争。重庆国民党反动当局曾于二十一日全天实行白昼戒严，出动军警宪特，防止学生游行，又于二十三日强压解散“重庆各校争取生存联合委员会”。蒋贼正在逃往的新巢穴厦门，据息也成立了警备司令部，负责计划厦门“防卫”。国民党西安绥靖公署主任胡宗南和陕西伪省主席董钊则于二十三日逃出南京返回西安。但不管这些国民党残余势力采取任何挣扎步骤，南方和西北所有反动地方政权如果不按照国内和平协定的条款向人民低头的话，中国人民的武装力量——人民解放军不多久就将使他们的反动地方统治宣告最后的结束，犹如过去他们在南京的统治一样。
