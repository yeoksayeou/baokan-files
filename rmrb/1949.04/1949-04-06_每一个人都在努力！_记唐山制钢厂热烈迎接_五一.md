Everyone is Working Hard!
    — A Record of the Tangshan Steel Plant's Enthusiastic Welcome to "May Day"
    By our reporters Lu Hao and Lin Li
    Workers are producing for themselves
    “What makes you work so actively today?”
    The reporters asked almost the same question to many staff members of the Tangshan Steel Plant, which had been liberated for more than three months – from workers and staff to the factory director. Although they had different experiences, the answer was the same: Because today they are working for themselves!
    Like Yao Yugang and Wang Zhanbin, who burn old white stone stoves in the steelmaking workshop, they are two group leaders who have automatically proposed a production increase competition in the recent production increase movement. They said: "Before liberation, when burning stoves for others, each stove was filled with at most one ton of material, and the maximum output of refractory stone was 350 kilograms, but now we are working for ourselves, and each stove is filled with a full 1.2 tons, and the average output of refractory stone is 570 kilograms." Saving materials, producing more finished products, and the number of personnel has been reduced from eight per shift in the past to five. What force makes the workers work so actively? Yao Yugang replied: "Now we are most happy about two things, one is having freedom and democracy, being the masters; the other is that wages are paid in kind." Wang Zhanbin used his own experience of freedom and democracy to prove: "Now, worker representatives also participate in the factory affairs meetings, and the production plan is discussed with the representatives first, and then let the workers discuss it, which has never happened before." What every worker experiences most deeply is the recent promotion of 60% of temporary workers to permanent workers. Wang Zhanbin said with great joy: "During the Kuomintang rule, there were no connections, and it was impossible to be promoted to a permanent worker, but this time the promotion was even allowed for workers to report themselves and discuss publicly, isn't this democracy in charge?" Regarding the in-kind wage system, many people said: "The nominal 'original salary' after liberation is actually much more." They told reporters about the situation: In the past, if wages were paid today, they would not be able to buy so many things tomorrow. Usually, half a month's salary could buy three or four斗 of corn, which was not enough for themselves, let alone support their families. As for now, a temporary worker earns at least 270斤 of millet, which is enough to support two or three people. It is not surprising that even Yang Fengming, a well-known "lazy man" in the electromechanical plant, who usually didn't even bother to go to the toilet to urinate, has recently volunteered to work overtime on Sundays. And he also advised others: "If we don't work overtime to repair today, it will be too late to roll steel tomorrow, and that will definitely delay production."
    Engineers have a stronger sense of responsibility
    An electric furnace trainee described the past and present of engineers to the reporter. He said: In the past, engineers often did not go to the smelting workshop, and some even slept in the bedroom, "commanding" the steelmaking by telephone. When the furnace worker asked him "Should I remove the slag?" He casually replied on the phone: "Remove it." After a while, the furnace worker asked again: "Should I tap the furnace?" He still replied: "Tap it!" Because he did not take care of it himself, the number of "bad furnaces" (meaning that steel could not be made) was alarming. Engineer Wang Leji confirmed the trainee's words, saying: "Before liberation, there were an average of three 'bad furnaces' per hundred furnaces, but after liberation, only one furnace has been bad since the start of work, which is one in four hundred." The trainee said that engineers after liberation are much closer to the workers. Whenever slag removal and furnace tapping occur, they are waiting by the furnace. They make plans, adjust personnel, and educate interns, which is better than in the past. There are now three engineers in the steelmaking workshop. They plan to produce three furnaces of steel per day starting from March 27. Although three furnaces of steel were also produced during the Chiang Kai-shek era, there were nine engineers at that time, which means that three people replaced the work of nine people in the past. According to engineer Wang Leji, the reason why they can work actively is because the plans he made are often supported by workers and military control representatives, especially the workers who have always been opposed to the factory, who immediately appeared as masters after liberation, and completely listened to his command in production work. He felt particularly interested in this point.
    Liu Jianzhong, the chief of the general affairs section, was an ordinary clerk before liberation. He revealed the reasons why the clerks after liberation not only did their jobs, but also expressed satisfaction: Before liberation, the clerks were all a little scared, afraid of being taken as prisoners, and afraid of not being given work. But in reality, it was not the case at all. The clerks generally felt that the Communist Party brought them job security. As long as they work hard, there is no danger of unemployment anymore.
    The factory director is dedicated to planning production
    When the reporter interviewed Director Shi Tong, he had just drafted the half-year production plan of the Tangshan Steel Plant. From his analysis of historical materials, the plant was founded by the Japanese puppets and is exactly six years old today. During the Japanese puppet period, it was originally planned to produce 500 tons of steel ingots per month, but it never reached half of the original plan. After the Kuomintang took over, it still aimed to produce 500 tons of steel ingots per month, but only one month's steel production reached 237 tons. Based on the fact that the highest output can be broken within two or three months after liberation, and the analysis of the sales of raw materials, Director Shi affirmed: "After the production competition in the Red May, the plan to produce 500 tons of steel ingots per month, which could not be realized by the Japanese invaders and the Kuomintang, can be realized by June." The factory director, who used to be a mechanical and electrical engineer, felt particularly different after liberation that his powers were easy to exercise, and the workers became active after the implementation of democratic management. What he was most worried about in the past was that production personnel could not be directed, but now it no longer exists. The personnel adjustment plan he recently drafted with the engineers was quickly put into practice, which made him feel unexpectedly smooth. He said: "This would not have been possible in the past."
    Everyone is working hard. The refractory material workshop under the plant's jurisdiction once created this microcosm. A few days ago, the water suction machine that supplied their water source was completely broken. The workshop director, engineers, and workers were very anxious. Seeing that the broken part was the water transmission wheel, which required copper casting, but the plant did not have copper casting equipment or sand casting talent, everyone was helpless. Going to the Tangshan plant (because it is located in Guye Town, 50 miles away from Tangshan) for repairs would be time-consuming, and it was impossible to melt a furnace of copper for a water transmission wheel. Engineer Qian borrowed sand from the street and pieced together a brick furnace. Zhuang Yuhe, Liu Guiying, Ma Shichang, and others from the machine room spent the night sand casting copper. The study group workers also automatically came to participate in pulling fire, carrying sand boxes, and casting copper. As soon as it was demolded, Ma Shichang immediately went to spin it, Liu Guiying followed to rivet and clean up the parts. Everyone cooperated fully, and the task was completed in 27 hours.
    Unfold a grand competition to welcome "May Day"
    Welcoming the first "May Day" after liberation and supporting the frontline production increase movement have been popularized in various workshops and workrooms under the steel plant. The steelmaking workshop staff, whose steel output in February reached an average of 196 tons before liberation, decided to break the highest record before liberation in April (according to the plant's history, the highest record was 237 tons in July 1937). To this end, they adjusted the unreasonable phenomenon that the factory personnel could not be controlled by engineers due to the establishment of positions for people during the Kuomintang rule. And in the existing personnel, three groups were added, including electric furnace repair, steel ingot sorting, and scrap steel sorting, thus changing the drawbacks of having to stop work for furnace repair and the inability to fully fill the steelmaking furnace. Facts have proved that the role of the electric furnace repair group is very significant. A few days ago, when the No. 1 furnace was making steel to the 17th furnace, it was suddenly found that the furnace wall was corroded by steel liquid. According to the previous practice before liberation, it would be stopped, dismantled and repaired separately, which would take at least half a month, and the production increase plan would fall through. This time, the workers of the electric furnace repair group took advantage of the high heat of 1,700 degrees at the bottom of the furnace to quickly replenish the refractory materials. After only one hour of rescue, the electric furnace continued to melt steel. Excited by the steelmaking plant, the rolling mill workshop announced the oath of increasing production on the 16th: The steel ingot pulling workers of the department challenged the workers who burn the reheating furnace, saying: "How much can you burn, we can roll out that much!" The workers who burn the reheating furnace immediately replied: "How much can you roll out, we can burn that much!" As a result of mutual encouragement, the plant created an unprecedented record of 230 steel bars produced per day that day (according to the average output of steel bars in the plant is seven tons, the highest output is nine tons, and 230 bars are 17.6 tons). At that time, the military control representative and the person in charge of the factory, in view of the workers' excessive fatigue, advised them "the daily number of rolled steel shall not exceed 160 bars (12 tons)." The electromechanical plant under the plant's jurisdiction worked overtime on Sundays to repair the oil switch of the rolling mill, and the refractory material plant also worked hard. According to the workers' high labor enthusiasm, the plant has put forward a plan for April, and decided to use a huge task of 240 tons of steel ingots and 200 tons of steel bars to welcome the first "May Day" Labor Day after the liberation of Tangshan.

　　每一个人都在努力！
    ——记唐山制钢厂热烈迎接“五一”
    本报记者陆灏  林里 　 工人是为自己生产
    “什么原因使你今天这样积极的工作？”
    记者几乎是用着同一个问题，分别访问了解放三个多月的唐山制钢厂的许多工作人员——从工人、职员、直到厂长。他们虽有各自不同的体验，但回答却是只有一个：因为今天是给自己做工了！
    象炼钢场烧老白石炉的姚玉刚和王占彬，他们是两个组长，在最近的增产运动中，他们自动地互相提出增产竞赛。他们说：“解放前给人家烧炉，每炉至多加料到一吨，最高出耐火石三百五十公斤，因为现在是给自己做工了，每炉加料都足足一吨二，出耐火石的平均数是五百七十公斤。”省料，多出成品，人员却由过去的每班八人减少到五个人。是什么力量使工人们这样积极工作呢？姚玉刚回答说：“现在我们最高兴的，一个是有了自由、民主，做主人；一个是工资发实物。”王占彬用他自己所体验到的自由民主证明说：“现在，厂务会议也有工人代表参加了，生产计划先和代表商量，又让工人大家讨论，这真是在这里从来所没有的。”为每个工人体验最深的，还是近来将做临时工的百分之六十工人提升为正式工的事。王占彬非常喜悦的说：“国民党统治时期，没有门子窗户，升不成正式工，而这次升工，还让工人自报公议，这不就是民主当家吗？”关于实物工资制，很多人都说：“解放后名义上是‘原薪’，但实际上可就多得多了。”他们向记者叙说这种情况：过去，今天发下工资，明天就买不到那么多东西，通常是半个月的工钱，买三四斗玉米，自己吃不饱，那里还能养家糊口？至于现在，一个临时工，最少赚二百七十斤小米，养活两三口人是不成问题的。这就毫不奇怪，连机电厂有名的“懒人”杨凤鸣，平素他连小便也懒得去厕所，最近在礼拜天他自动加班了。并且他还劝别人说：“今天要不加班修理，明天来不及轧钢，那一定要耽误生产的。” 　 工程师责任心强了
    电炉实习生，向记者叙述了工程师的过去与现在。他说：过去工程师经常不到炼炉场，甚而有的睡在卧室里，用电话“指挥”炼钢，炉工问他“该不该扒渣？”他随便地在电话里回一声：“扒吧。”过一会炉工又问：“该不该出炉？”他仍回一声：“出吧！”因为他不亲自照看，“坏炉”（即炼不成钢之意）是非常惊人的。王乐基工程师证实实习生的话说：“解放前平均每百炉有三次‘坏炉’，而解放后，开工至今只坏过一个炉，是四百分之一。”实习生说解放以后的工程师和工人的接近多了，每逢扒渣、出炉，均守候在炉旁，他们订计划，调整人员，教育实习性，都比过去好了。炼钢场现在有三个工程师，他们拟自三月二十七日起，每日出钢三炉。蒋匪时代虽也曾经出过三炉钢，但那时有九个工程师，就是说三个人代替了过去九个人的工作。照工程师王乐基的说法，他们之所以能够积极工作，是因为他拟定的计划，经常得到工人、军管代表的支持，特别是一向和厂方对立的工人，解放后立时以主人的姿态出现，生产上的工作完全听从他的支配。这一点，他感到特别的兴趣。
    总务科长刘建中，解放前是一普通职员，他对解放后职员们不仅尽职工作，而且还表现满意的情形，说出了其中的原因：解放前，职员们都有些恐惧，害怕当俘虏，怕不给事做。但实际完全不是那末回事，职员们普遍的感到共产党给他们带来职业的保障。只要努力工作，就再也没有失业的危险。 　 厂长专心计划生产
    记者访问史通厂长的时候，他刚巧拟好了唐山制钢厂半年生产计划，从他对历史材料的分析看，该厂创始于日伪之手，至今刚好是它的六周岁。日伪时期本拟月产钢锭五百吨，但始终未能达成原计划的一半。国民党接受后，仍以月产五百吨钢锭为目标，然而仅有一个月产钢量达到二百三十七吨。史厂长根据解放后两三月内即可突破最高产量，和对原料销路的分析，他肯定说：“经过红五月的生产竞赛，到六月份即可实现日寇、国民党均不能实现的月产五百吨钢锭的计划。”这位当过机械、电气工程师的厂长，他感到解放后特别异样的是，职权容易施展，实行民主管理后，工人都积极了。过去他所最烦恼的是，生产人员不能指挥，现在不存在了。他最近和工程师们草拟的人员调整计划，很快见诸实践，这使他感到想象不到的顺利。他说：“这在过去，是无论如何做不通的。”
    每一个人，全在努力。该厂辖下的耐火材料工场，曾经创造了这一缩影。日前，供他们水源的吸水机，整个坏了，工场主任、工程师、工人都很着急，一看坏的是输水轮，必需铸铜，而该厂没有铸铜设备，也没有翻砂人材，大家束手无策，到唐山本厂（因它设于距唐山五十华里外的古冶镇）去修，既费时间，又不可能为了一个输水轮来融化一炉铜；还是钱工程师到街上借来了砂子，拼凑起一个砖炉，机器房的庄玉和、刘贵英、马世昌等，连夜翻砂铸铜了。学习组工友也自动前来参加拉火、抬砂箱、铸铜，刚一脱模，马世昌立即去旋，刘贵英跟着去铆钉、收拾零件，大家全力合作，二十七小时工夫，就把任务完成了。 　 展开大竞赛迎接“五一”
    迎接解放后的第一个“五一”，和支援前线增产运动，已普及于制钢厂辖下的各工场与各个工作间。二月份产钢量达到解放前平均数一百九十六吨的炼钢场职工，决在四月份突破解放前的最高纪录（按该厂有史以来，以三十七年七月的二百三十七吨为最高纪录）。为此，他们调整了过去国民党统治时期因人设事、工场人员不能由工程师支配的不合理现象。并在现有人员中，添设电炉修理、钢锭整理、废钢整理等三个小组，因而改变了修炉必须停工，与炼钢炉不能充分加料的弊病。事实证明，电炉修理组的作用很大，日前，一号炉炼钢到十七炉，忽然发现炉墙为钢液蚀坏，照解放前的惯例，便停下来，大拆大卸另修理，那样至少停工半个月，增产计划会全部落空。而此次电炉修理组的工友们，趁炉底一千七百度的高热，急速的补上耐火器材，仅一小时的抢救，电炉便继续溶钢了。为炼钢厂所激动的轧钢工场，则于十六日宣布了增产的誓言：该部拉钢锭工友，向烧再热炉的工友挑战说：“你们能烧出多少，我们就能轧出多少！”烧再热炉的工友立时回答说：“你们能轧出多少，我们就能烧出多少。”互相激励的结果，当天开创该厂日产钢条二百三十根的空前纪录（按该厂钢条平均产量为七吨，最高产量是九吨，二百三十根合十七吨六。）当时，住厂军管代表与厂负责人，鉴于工人的过度疲劳，才劝他们“每天轧钢数量不得超过一百六十根（合十二吨）。”该厂所辖之机电场，礼拜天加班修理轧钢场的油开关，耐火材料场也同样热烈的努力工作。厂部根据工人们高度的劳动热忱，已提出四月份的计划，决以二百四十吨钢锭，二百吨钢条的巨大任务，来迎接唐山解放后的第一个“五一”劳动节。
