　　Seventh Ordnance Factory No. 6 Institute
　　Abolishes Estimated Work, Adopts Work Recording
　　[Ping City News] The No. 6 Institute of the Seventh Ordnance Factory is the department responsible for making tool templates and repairing machinery. In the past, work was done using an estimated work method. Because the scope of work was complex, those estimating work hours could not understand the entire work situation in detail, leading to inconsistent estimates. Workers' efficiency could not be accurately reflected, and there were often cases of talent being buried. Workers successively requested a change to a work recording method. After discussion by the masses, a "work recording sheet" was created, clearly recording the completion time, quality, and precision of the work. Since its implementation on April 11th, the workers have been giving full play to their individual abilities. Workers Yang Shulin and Du Xuze secretly brought their own hardened knives, stone calipers, and folding rulers to the factory for use. The group responsible for making part of the launching cylinder, in order to welcome "May 1st," wanted to exceed the monthly quota, and production has now increased by 30 percent. All the workers in the institute are rarely away from their posts. The technicians and foremen responsible for inspecting the work have also become serious, not allowing for any carelessness.

　　七十兵工厂六所
  　废除估工改用记工
    【平市讯】七十兵工厂第六所是负责做工具样板、修理机械的部门。过去工作是用估工办法。因工作范围复杂，估计工时的人不能详细了解整个工作情况，以致估计工时忽多忽少，工人的工作效率不能正确表现出来，时常有埋没的现象，工人纷纷要求改用记工办法。经大众研究，产生出来一种“记工表”，把作品完成的时间、质量、精确程度，很清楚的记载下来。自从四月十一日施行以来，工人都尽量地发挥了个人力量。工人杨书林、杜续泽，偷偷地把自己家的硬刀、石卡钳、折尺都拿到工厂里使用。负责做发射筒的一部分人，为了迎接“五一”，要超过本月预定量，现在生产量已增加了百分之三十。全所工人都轻易不离岗位。检收活的技术员、领班们，也认真起来，一丝不肯马虎。
