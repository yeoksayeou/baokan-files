Xinji Industrial and Agricultural Products Grand Exhibition
By Our Correspondent Yao Fu

From the south entrance of Xinji City to the train station, a distance of half a li, the ground was completely connected by vendor stalls and crowds of people. Especially under a row of reed mats bearing the bright red characters "Strengthen the ties between urban and rural areas," people were packed so tightly they could barely breathe.

Just inside the entrance was a sales and exchange introduction center to facilitate purchases for farmers. Opposite it was a "Genuine and Fake Currency Identification Area," where people were concentrated, carefully examining the beautifully printed Renminbi.

(1) Industrial Products Exhibition and Sale

Look! Here are displayed over 1,100 finished products from the steel, soap, textile, fur, woodworking, chemical, and toothbrush industries, exclusively for the public to view. Here, well-digging equipment of all kinds, such as wrought iron waterwheels, bamboo tubes, tree palm fiber, and cement, were prepared by the Jizhong Water Conservancy Promotion Society last winter. They are an organization specifically leading farmers in the construction of water conservancy projects, and last year completed the "Thousand Well Movement" in Shulu County, adding 200 new waterwheels. The "clack-clack" sound attracts people forward, where someone is shaking a shiny flywheel in their hand, a product of the six-foot-long waterwheel next to him. There are also newly cast plowshares and spooling wheels, created by the workers of the public-owned Wanjü Iron Factory under the most difficult conditions.

The production of cotton gin rollers indicates a new development in the recovery of Xinji's specialty, the fur industry. Before the Incident (likely referring to a military conflict), the area was one of the distribution centers for the fur industry, but mostly for raw hides and leather goods, and whips. There was little production of essential ginning tools; however, things are completely different now. The annual output will be 34,000 rollers, supporting the development of the ginning industry. The state-owned Wanjü Tannery holds a leading position, guaranteeing the production of 17,000 rollers.

"Do you use hydrosulfite and pigments? Please go over there." In recent years, on the vast open fields outside Xinji City, tall chimneys have been erected. This is the state-owned Yonghua Chemical Factory, which has grown from nothing to its current size, employing over 200 people. They use local resources to produce sodium sulfide, sulfur blue, nitric acid, and refined glue. Through worker experimentation, they have improved the quality of pigments, increasing the amount of cloth dyed per liang (approx. 50 grams) from six to ten chi (approx. 3.3 meters). In the past, the sodium sulfide had a two-inch black base, but that is no longer the case. Its products are in high demand and have been sold to Taihang, Jinzhong, Jiaodong, and other regions.

On the crossbar of the soap industry's stall are hung the awards given by the government to the "Wind Travels Ten Thousand Li" and "Five Blessings" brands. These were successfully manufactured by workers Li Huantong and Qiao Jichang, and are of strong, durable quality, producing abundant lather and effective cleaning. Further ahead are towels, fabrics, and various daily necessities.

Xinji's industry has developed. According to March statistics, there are already 585 industrial and handicraft businesses, and 228 commercial businesses. This is a grand review of the labor achievements of over 3,000 workers.

(2) In Front of the "Agricultural Affairs Exhibition" Stall

In the row of exhibition stalls in the northwest corner of the temple fair, there are crowds of visitors all day long. There, piled high, are the excellent varieties that Xinji Farm has successfully experimented with over the years, as well as pesticides and methods for eliminating pests and diseases. There are also seedlings of peach, apricot, elm, and poplar trees, and specimens and colored charts of cotton, millet, and wheat. Particularly noteworthy are the large breeding livestock of sheep, cattle, donkeys, and horses in the corner of the stall. The young demonstrator's mouth never stops moving, as he provides a popular and profound introduction to the five cartoons on the wall, "Old Zhao's Losses from Not Catching Aphids." The heads of the audience moved like they were placed in a cradle, swinging back and forth with the slender stick, and no amount of noise or drums could distract them. When it was introduced that the neighbor who caught aphids was bringing grain home, people unanimously said to themselves, "Old Zhao worked for nothing."

I listened with interest to them discussing various issues such as intensive farming, seed soaking, and seed selection with the demonstrator. Yun Hu, a 48-year-old farmer from Jiuleitou Village, Shulu County, who had just been allocated about ten mu of land, saw the tender green peach tree seedlings labeled "Each tree is worth four liang of millet, one mu can sell for 1,500 jin." After asking about planting methods in detail, he assured the demonstrator, "I will definitely plant more when I go back." He then walked to the cotton specimen next to him. "How can the floss be so big?" "This is American cotton, Sizi No. 4," the demonstrator continued to introduce the properties, yield, and diseases of the cotton. "What if there is oil blight?" "There is a solution, use 'tobacco ash water' and it will be fine." He politely asked me to write down a prescription.

(3) Visiting the Tractor

Particularly novel were the two tractors. The young driver sat on the tractor, introducing the function and power of each component. Children jumped around innocently, while farmers, both men and women, asked all sorts of questions with curiosity. Xue Zhang, from the fourth street of the city, touched the shiny iron plate, and then bent down to look at the oil tank below, caressing it carefully like her own child.

"This is the tractor! I've finally seen it."

"Didn't the worker say at the meeting the other day that they were coming? With this, we can have a great turnaround and won't need donkeys anymore," another woman said.

"What was said should be done, there is no mistake. We can enjoy more happiness in the future!"

"That's right!" The driver continued, "There are dozens more in Jin County! We are being trained and will graduate soon. There are harvesters, weeding machines, and plowing machines, and they can also grind grain, chop straw, and haul manure, there are so many things they can do, fifty or sixty things." Turning his head, he pointed to the green slogan: "Look! Only by organizing can we start using tractors."

"Yes! Wait and see, I never dreamed of this in my sixty years, and I will definitely see the benefits in ten years or so."

The driver's demonstration of plowing further aroused the farmers' infinite envy and inspired their victorious spirit.

(4) The Origin of the Temple Fair

This is the second year for the Xinji Spring Festival Temple Fair. It is said that in addition to exchanging goods between urban and rural areas, it also has another meaning, which is to sweep the tomb of Comrade Wang Xianchen, commander of the Sixth Military Sub-district of Jizhong, and all the martyrs of the sub-district. Therefore, the fair period is set around the Qingming Festival, on February 22nd of the lunar calendar. Commander Wang participated in the Great Revolution and gloriously sacrificed himself in the Battle of Lü Village, Zhao County, during the War of Resistance Against Japan. Just as it is written on the archway filled with lush cypress trees in front of his tomb, "Died for the People." Yes, the blood of the martyrs was not shed in vain, and it is reflected in the red and green flowers pasted on the spherical top of his tomb, cultivating a democratic and free life.

March 28th.

　　辛集工农业品大展览
    本报记者  药夫
    从辛集市南街口一直到车站半里多的地面上，完全被货摊人群联到了一起，尤其在写着鲜红的“密切城乡联系”字样的一排席棚下，人民更拥挤的出不过气来。
    一进门口便是为农民购买方便的买卖交流介绍所。在对面便是“真假票识别处”，人们都集中注视着精美的人民券。
    （一）工业品展览售卖
    看吧！这里陈列着钢铁业、肥皂、纺织、皮毛、木工、化学、牙刷等行业的成品一千一百多件，专供来往群众参观。这里熟铁水车、竹筒、树棕、洋灰…………等各种打井器材，是冀中水利推进社去冬准备好的成品。他们是专门领导农民兴修水利的机关，去年在束鹿县完成了“千眼井运动”，新添水车二百辆。“嘎嘎”的声音吸引着人们前进，那里一个人手里摇着光亮车飞轮，是他一旁六尺长元车的产品。还有新铸犁铧、络线车，这是公营万聚铁工厂工人在最困难条件下，自己创造的。
    轧花皮轴的生产指明了辛集的特产皮毛业恢复中新的发展。该地事变前虽然是皮毛业的集散地之一，但多是白皮与皮件、皮鞭；轧花重要工具生产无几；可是现在完全不同了，全年要出三万四千根，扶植弹轧业的发展，而国营万聚制革厂占居了领导地位，保证出产一万七千根。
    “你用嗅碱和颜料吗？请到那边去。”近年来辛集市外广大的原野上，垒起了高高的烟筒，这就是从无到有、从小到大，二百多人的国营永华化学厂。他们用土产能制硫化碱、硫化青、硝酸、精制胶，经工人试验提高了颜料提质由每两染布六尺增加到十尺。过去有二寸黑底的硫化碱，现在已经没有了。他的产品供不应求，已销到太行、晋中、胶东等地。
    在肥皂业棚口的横杆上挂着政府奖给“风行万里”和“五幅”牌的奖状，这是工人李焕同、乔济昌制造成功的，质坚耐久，沫多去垢。再向前看便是毛巾布匹和各种日用品了。
    辛集的工业发展了，据三月统计工业户与手工业已有五百八十五户，商户有二百二十八户。这是三千多工人劳动成果的大检阅。
    （二）在“农事展览”棚前
    在庙会的西北角一排的展览棚里，整天是拥挤不过来的观众。那里堆满了辛集农场几年来试验成功的优良品种，和铲除病虫害的药剂与方法。还有桃、杏、榆、杨幼苗，和棉、谷、麦的标本与色彩的图表。特别引人注意是棚下角的大个的羊、牛、驴、马的种畜。年青的说明员嘴巴总没有停下来，他通俗而深刻的介绍席壁上那五幅“老赵不捉黏虫受损失”的漫画。观众的头象放在摇篮里一样，随着细长的小棍摆来摆去，任何的喧嚷与鼓乐从没有转移了他们的视线。当介绍到末了捉黏虫的邻居往家弄粮食时，不约而同人们自言自语的说：“老赵白闹了”。
    我有趣的听他们和说明探讨着精耕细作、浸种、选种等各种问题。束鹿县旧累头村四十八岁的云虎，是刚分到了十来亩地的农民，见到嫩绿的桃树苗上写着“每棵可值四两小米，一亩可卖一千五百斤。”他详问了栽培办法后向说明员保证：“回去一定多种。”他又向一旁的棉花标本走去。“怎么绒絮这么大？”“这是美棉斯子四号”，说明员接着介绍了棉的性质、产量、病状。“有了油龙怎么办呢？”“有办法，使‘烟草小灰水’就可以了。”他客气的托我记下了一个药方。
    （三）参观了拖拉机
    特别新奇的是两部拖拉机。年青的驾驶员坐在拖拉机上介绍每个机件的作用与动力。儿童们在一旁天真的跳跃，农夫和农妇们在警奇的发问着种种疑问。该市四街的薛张氏摸摸光亮的铁板，又弯下腰注视下边的油箱，象自己的孩子似的精心的抚摸。
    “这就是拖拉机呀！可见着了。”
    “那天工作员开会不是说来吗？有了这个才能大翻身，那就用不着毛驴了。”另一妇女说：
    “说到那儿应到那儿，一点也错不了。往后更可以享福啦！”
    “不错！”驾驶员接着介绍：“晋县还有几十部呢！我们正在受训，快毕业了。有收割机、锄地机、耕地机，还能拉磨、铡草、送粪活可作的多了，多到五、六十样。”回头他又指向绿色的标语：“你看！只有组织起来方能开始使用拖拉机。”
    是！等着吧，我活了六十岁作梦都想不到，再过十几年一定见到好处了。”
    驾驶员演习了耕地，更使农民无限的羡慕，鼓舞着他们的胜利的心情。
    （四）庙会的起因
    辛集的春节庙会是第二年了，据说除了交流城乡物资之外，还有另外的意义，这就是为给冀中原六分区司令员王先臣同志及全分区烈士们扫墓。所以会期定为清明前后二月二十二日。王司令参加过大革命，在抗日战斗时，在赵县吕村战斗中光荣的牺牲了。正如他墓前插满翠柏的牌门上写的“为人民而死”。是的，先烈的血并没有白流，与他球形的墓顶贴的红绿花相映着，培养出了民主自由的生活。
