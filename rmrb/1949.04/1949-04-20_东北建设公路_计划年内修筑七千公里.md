Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 19th: The Northeast Administrative Committee is strengthening highway construction work. Now, various provinces have successively transported materials to the sites. Among them, Liaoxi, Liaoning, Andong, Liaobei, Jilin and other provinces have already started construction. By May, more than 80,000 people and 10,000 large vehicles will participate in the construction. This is another important construction undertaking after the Northeast Railway management work has gradually entered the right track. The highway management agencies at all levels in the Northeast, which are in charge of this work, have been established after more than four months of efforts. The Ministry of Finance has allocated 10,000 tons of public grain to solve the expenses for various engineering materials this year. At the first Northeast Highway Conference held by the Ministry of Communications in February, a highway repair plan from March 1949 to June 1950 was drafted and has been approved by the Political Committee. It is planned to repair 24 main highways with a total length of 9,987 kilometers. This year, priority will be given to completing 19 trunk lines that play a significant role in connecting the interior or facilitating economic, political, and cultural exchange between urban and rural areas, such as the Shenyu Line (Shenyang to Shanhaiguan), Shengulin Line (Shenyang to Gubeikou), Chenglin Line (Chengde to Linxi), Hasui Line (Harbin to Suiyuan), Hachang Line (Harbin to Changchun), Wutong Line (Ulanhot to Tongliao), and the Beihei section (Bei'an to Heihe) of the Lianhei Line (Dalian to Heihe), totaling 7,350 kilometers.
