Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, April 14th: Reports from various sources indicate that the reactionary French government has unreasonably and brazenly decided to issue entry visas to only eight members of each foreign delegation attending the World Congress of Supporters of Peace. Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, and other countries have received formal notification of this reactionary decision from the French government. Consequently, the majority of delegates from these countries will be deprived of their right to participate in the work of defending world peace. The Preparatory Committee for the Peace Congress has received many letters and telegrams protesting this decision. The Preparatory Committee held a press conference on the 12th for this purpose. A member of the Preparatory Committee, the famous French writer Aragon, lodged a firm protest against this decision by the French government. Public opinion circles in Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria, Romania, and other countries have unanimously expressed their anger and protest at this behavior of the French government. Romanian newspapers emphasized that American imperialism and its French lackeys fear that the Congress will express the peace aspirations of hundreds of millions of people. It is foolish for the reactionaries to try to weaken the powerful resonance that the Peace Congress has created around the world.

Also: On the 12th, the Preparatory Committee of the World Congress of Supporters of Peace, representing 600 million peace supporters worldwide, sent a telegram to the Brazilian government protesting the Brazilian government police's dispersal and shooting of students participating in the Brazilian Peace Congress on the 9th.

　　法政府限制和平代表入境
  　全世界愤慨抗议
    【新华社北平十四日电】各方报导：法国反动政府已无理地悍然决定，对每个外国出席世界拥护和平大会的代表团，只发给八人的入境护照。捷、保、罗等国已接到法政府这一反动派的正式通知。因此，这些国家代表团的大部分代表，将被夺去参加保卫世界和平工作的权利。和平大会筹委会已收到许多抗议这一决定的函电。筹委会为此于十二日举行记者招待会。筹委会委员，法名作家阿拉贡，向法政府这一决定提出坚决的抗议。捷、保、罗等国舆论界，对于法政府这一行为，一致表示愤怒与抗议。罗马尼亚报纸强调称：美帝国主义及其法国走卒惧怕大会将表示千千万万人民的和平愿望。反动派想以此来削弱和平大会在全世界所造成的强有力的回响，那是蠢笨的。
    又：世界拥护和平大会筹委会于十二日代表世界六万万和平拥护者，致电巴西政府，抗议巴西政府警察于九日驱散并枪杀参加巴西和平大会的学生。
