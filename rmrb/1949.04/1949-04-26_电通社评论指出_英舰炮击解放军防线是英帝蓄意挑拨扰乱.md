Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, April 24th - A Reuter dispatch from London on April 22nd commented on the incident of British imperialist warships violating China's inland river sovereignty and shelling the People's Liberation Army's defense line, provoking the victorious PLA troops crossing the river, pointing out that this was a deliberate and abhorrent provocative act by the British government. The report exposed the lie of the HMS Amethyst (Note: This is the name of the first British destroyer that intruded into the PLA defense line) sailing upstream along the river for the so-called "peaceful mission." It also stated: "After the Kuomintang rejected the peace terms, the date of the PLA's launching of the river-crossing offensive was predictable. The so-called coincidence of the ship sailing upstream with the date of the major offensive is being ridiculed by observers." The commentary further pointed out that this imperialist adventure was intended to conduct containment operations on the river when the PLA was preparing to cross, and then analyzed the action, saying that it might be used as a prelude to creating more local provocative incidents to disrupt the PLA and hinder their advance.

　　电通社评论指出
  　英舰炮击解放军防线是英帝蓄意挑拨扰乱
    【新华社北平二十四日电】电通社伦敦二十二日电评论英帝国主义军舰侵犯中国内河主权，炮击人民解放军防线，向胜利渡江的解放军挑衅的事件，指明这是英国政府蓄意而可恶的挑拨行为。该报道揭露紫石英号（按系第一艘侵入人民解放军防线的英驱逐舰名）的沿江上驶是为了所谓“和平的使命”的谎言。又说：“在国民党拒绝和平条件后，人民解放军发动渡江大攻势的日期，是可以逆料的。所谓该舰上驶与大攻势日期只是偶合的说法，受到观察家们的嘲笑”。该评论在进一步指出这种帝国主义冒险是为了在解放军准备渡江时在江面上进行牵制行动之后，分析这一行动说，这可能是用作制造更多的地方性挑衅事件以扰乱解放军，阻挠他们前进的先奏。
