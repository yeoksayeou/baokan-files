Xinhua News Agency, New York (TASS dispatch): The National Council of the American-Soviet Friendship Association sent a letter to the U.S. Senators on the 11th, strongly urging them not to ratify the North Atlantic Treaty (according to the U.S. Constitution, a treaty with a foreign country must be approved by a two-thirds majority of the Senate before it can be established), and requested that the responsible representatives of the American people have full opportunity to express their opinions on the treaty to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. On the same day, three hundred educators, Christian pastors, and other social celebrities from thirty-three states in the United States jointly issued an open letter to Truman and the 81st Congress, requesting the rejection of the North Atlantic Treaty as a war measure, and urging Truman to immediately begin negotiations with the Soviet Union to peacefully resolve all significant differences.
