　　With Soviet Friendship and Assistance
  　Lushun's Electrical Construction Advances Rapidly
    Electric Lights, Electric Stoves, and Radios are Commonly Used in Urban and Rural Areas
    Farmers in the Lushun-Dalian Area Begin Spring Planting
    [Xinhua News Agency, Dalian, 20th] The electrical construction industry in Lushun City has achieved remarkable results in the past three years with Soviet assistance. The city's total power capacity has increased more than four times compared to the peak period under Japanese rule. During the Japanese occupation, there was only one substation in the city with a capacity of only 3,000 kilowatts. Now, in addition to the capacity of that substation having doubled, three new substations have been built in the city, bringing the total power capacity to 16,200 kilowatts. Due to the sharp increase in electricity, the city's power supply has been fully guaranteed. The number of electric lights in the city during the Japanese occupation was only 17,635, but now there are 31,164 electric lights for general civilian use alone. Many remote villages have also installed electric lights, and many farmers can now use electric stoves for cooking and radios.
    [Xinhua News Agency, Dalian, 21st] Farmers in the Lushun and Dalian areas are about to begin planting. In Jin County, which accounts for one-half of the total area of Lushun-Dalian, more than 90 percent of the arable land has been plowed, and the land in Dalian County has also been largely plowed. Under the promotion of the Communist Party organizations and Party members at all levels, farmers have begun to pay attention to intensive cultivation.

　　在苏联友谊帮助下
  　旅顺电气建设猛进
    城乡电灯电炉收音机普遍使用
    旅大区农民开始春季播种
    【新华社大连二十日电】旅顺市电气建设事业三年来在苏联帮助下已获显著成绩。全市总容电量已较日寇统治时期的最高容电量憎加四倍以上。日寇统治时期全市仅有变电所一处，容电量仅三千基罗瓦特，现除该变电所容电量已增加一倍外，市内又已建设变电所三处，合计总容电量共达一万六千二百基罗瓦特。由于电量的剧增，市内用电已获充分保证。全市电灯数目在日寇统治时期仅有一万七千六百三十五盏，现在仅一般市民用电灯即有三万一千一百六十四盏。许多的僻农村也装设了电灯，不少农民亦可使用电炉煮饭及使用无线电收音机。
    【新华社大连二十一日电】旅顺、大连地区农民，即将开始播种。占旅大全区面积二分之一的金县，有百分之九十以上的耕地已经耕完，大连县土地亦已大体耕完。在各级共产党的组织和党员的推动下，农民已开始注意了精耕细作。
