　　Tianjin Textile Factories Under China Textile Corporation
  　Initiate Full-Shift Production
    [Tianjin Electric Dispatch] After the people's government actively helped solve the raw cotton supply problem of the six textile factories under the Tianjin Branch of China Textile Corporation, all factories have started full-shift production (six days and nights of work per week) since the 16th. During the Kuomintang rule, half of the raw cotton required by the company relied on American and Indian cotton, and it only operated three days a week. When Tianjin was liberated, the company's raw cotton inventory was only enough to maintain normal production for 20 days. Therefore, at that time, it could only operate three day and night shifts per week. In mid-March, it increased from three day and night shifts to four day and night shifts per week. By April 1, it had increased to five day and night shifts. Recently, thanks to the help of the North China Trade Corporation and friendly liberated areas, the required raw cotton has been supplied steadily, and the factories have the conditions to start full-shift production.

　　津市中纺各厂
  　开全班生产
    【天津电】天津中纺分公司所属六个纺织厂的原棉供给问题，在人民政府积极帮助解决后，已自十六日起一律开全班（每周开工六昼夜）。在国民党统治时期，该公司所需原棉，半数依靠美棉、印棉，且每周仅开工三天。津市解放时，该公司库存原棉，仅够正常生产情况下维持二十天之用，因此，当时每周也只能开工三昼夜，三月中旬，始由每周三个昼夜班，增为四个昼夜班，至四月一日，又增为五个昼夜班，最近，由于华北贸易公司及各友邻解放区的帮助，所需全部原棉，已得到源源供应，各厂方有开全班的条件。
