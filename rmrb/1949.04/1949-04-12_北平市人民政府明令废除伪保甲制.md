　　Peiping Municipal People's Government
  　Orders Abolition of the Pseudo-Baojia System
    [Report from this newspaper] The Peiping Municipal People's Government has ordered the abolition of the oppressive pseudo-Baojia system and the establishment of people's street (township) governments. This matter has been listed as one of the key tasks of the Municipal Civil Affairs Bureau in April. The approximately four hundred new street (township) regimes in the twenty-four districts of Peiping's urban and suburban areas will strive to be universally established within this month.

    All former Baojia personnel will be dealt with separately according to their individual circumstances. Among them, criminals and special agents who have harmed lives and are now unrepentant will be arrested and brought to justice. Those who have committed serious crimes of corruption and extortion, causing families to be broken up and ruined, and are hated by the people, will be allowed to be liquidated by the people after collecting conclusive evidence, and then the accused will be handed over to the People's Court for sentencing. For those who have not committed many evils, have not committed major corruption, and are not severely hated by the masses, their jobs will be revoked, they will be allowed to admit their mistakes to the people, and they will be given the opportunity to redeem themselves. For pseudo-Baojia personnel (especially Jia chiefs) who are relatively upright, have no corruption or extortion behavior, and are still understood by the people, they will continue to be retained and strengthened in their work. The eighteen districts of Shijingshan, Mentougou, Changxindian, Fengtai, and Haidian in the suburbs have already established township governments because they were liberated earlier. The districts in the city and near the city walls, because the people suffered extremely deep oppression and deception under reactionary rule, and were liberated relatively late, have not been organized for a while and it is difficult to quickly and universally establish street and township governments. In order to be cautious and avoid bias, it has been decided to first use full force to establish a model street and township in each district to create experience for gradual promotion. (Zhong)

　　北平市人民政府
  　明令废除伪保甲制
    【本报讯】北平人民市政府明令废除压迫人民的伪保甲制度，建立人民的街（乡）政府。此事已列为市府民政局四月份的工作重点之一。平市各城区郊区的二十四个区约有四百个街（乡）的新政权，将争取在本月内普遍建立起来。
    所有旧保甲人员，将按各人情况分别处理。其中伤害人命的犯罪分子及特务分子，现在又不悔过自新者，逮捕法办。犯有严重贪污勒索罪行，使人妻离子散，家败人亡，为人民所痛恨的分子，搜集确实证据后，允许人民清算，然后将被控告者交人民法庭判处。对一般作恶不多，贪污不大，群众痛恨不严重的分子，撤销其工作，让其向人民承认错误，给以戴罪图功的机会。对伪保甲人员（特别是甲长）比较正派，无贪污勒索行为，人民尚能谅解者，仍将继续留用，在工作中加强改造。现郊区的石景山、门头沟、长辛店、丰台及海淀一带之十八区因解放较早，已全部成立了乡政权。城内和靠近城垣的各区，因为人民在反动统治下受到极端深重的压迫与欺骗，且解放较晚，一时未及组织起来，难于迅速普遍的建立街乡政权。为了慎重、不出偏向，决在各区先用全力建立一个示范街乡，用以创造经验，逐步推广。（仲）
