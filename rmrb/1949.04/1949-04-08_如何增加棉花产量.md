　　How to Increase Cotton Production
　　·Xi Fengzhou·
    Cotton is an important raw material for industry. If we want to develop the textile industry in the future, we will need a large amount of high-quality raw cotton. Therefore, how to increase cotton production is worthy of attention and research.
    In recent years, due to the lack of labor and livestock power, reduced fertilization, and rough cultivation techniques, cotton production has decreased significantly. For example, in Gaoyi, Wu'an and other places in the Taihang area, cotton fields that used to produce more than 200 jin of seed cotton per mu can now only produce about 100 jin or even dozens of jin. Other cotton-producing areas have the same phenomenon. The average reduction is about 50% or more. According to the cotton planting situation in various places last year, many cotton plants did not grow well. Research shows that there are the following reasons:
    1. Fertilization: Cotton is a deep-rooted crop with a long growing period. It cannot grow well without sufficient fertilizer. Some farmers use too much pig manure, which causes the cotton plants to develop disorderly branches and leaves, and no cotton bolls are formed. Some people mistakenly believe that cotton can grow well without fertilizer, which is wrong. Cotton not only needs fertilizer, but also needs to be fertilized reasonably. Oil cake, pen manure, and compost can all be used as base fertilizer. If the soil is not alkaline, some plant ash can also be added to prevent cotton diseases. Generally, for thin soil, some human manure and urine can also be added, but not too much.
    2. Cotton sowing: This is an important issue in cotton planting work. It is not good to sow too deep or too shallow. For example, last year in Shahe, someone planted "Tuozizi" cotton more than four inches deep. Although the cotton seeds germinated in the soil, they could not emerge. Some people planted too shallow, and the cotton seeds were exposed on the ground and dried out, so they could not germinate. In addition, attention should also be paid to the quality of seeds and the timing of sowing. "Sow cotton when jujube buds sprout" is the right time to sow. If insect-damaged seeds, immature seeds, or old seeds are sown, they will not germinate easily. Generally, the sowing amount should be four to five jin per mu. The amount should be increased if the seeds do not germinate well.
    3. Pay attention to the climate: For example, last year, it was also advocated to grow cotton in colder regions, but due to the early autumn frost, most of the cotton bolls did not crack, and the yield was very low. It is better to grow food crops. This year, we have a vast cotton-growing area, and we can grow a lot of cotton. Areas that are not suitable for cotton growing should not be forced to grow it.
    4. Cotton management: (1) Cotton seedling retention: The general habit is to retain dense seedlings, resulting in dense branches and leaves that are not ventilated, few cotton bolls, and they are not easy to crack quickly, and are also prone to pests and diseases. (2) Cotton pruning: According to the experience of planting cotton in Licheng, Lucheng, and Xingtai areas of the Taihang area for several years, it is believed that cotton pruning can increase cotton production, but some areas have experimental results that cotton pruning will not increase production. According to research results, whether or not to prune should be based on specific circumstances. For example, cotton in colder climates or sown later can be pruned to promote early maturity and increase cotton production. If there is excessive autumn rain or cotton varieties with many branches and leaves, pruning can also be done. However, in the vast cotton-growing areas with warm climates, it is not suitable for pruning. There is also a type of "Sizi" cotton 2B, which has many fruit branches and few leaf branches, and generally does not need to be pruned. If pruning is too late or not done properly, it will also reduce cotton production.
    5. Aphids, drought, and insects: Aphids are the main insect pests of cotton. Last year, this insect pest occurred widely in many cotton-growing areas. The most serious cases reduced production by one-third, and the average reduction was more than 10%. Therefore, this year, organizing and guiding the prevention and control of aphids in cotton-growing areas in a planned manner is the main issue to ensure increased cotton production. The method of treatment is to use two liang of quicklime and two liang of tobacco leaves to make an emulsion for spraying, which is very effective in experiments.
    6. How to promote timely cracking of cotton bolls: Last year, the cotton grown in various places left many cotton bolls that could not be opened in late autumn, reducing production. To make the cotton bolls crack, the following points should be noted: (1) Use early-maturing cotton varieties. (2) If there is excessive rainfall, and foreign flowers grow more branches, pruning should be done frequently to prevent disorderly growth, so that the cotton bolls on the fruit branches will naturally crack early. (3) Cotton should not be grown on shady slopes or in cold mountainous areas. Cotton grown in black fertile soil will grow more branches and leaves and mature later. Cotton grown in sandy soil is easy to penetrate sunlight, the soil temperature is high, and the cotton bolls open early. (4) Do not apply too much pig manure, too much will cause disorderly growth of branches and leaves, and the cotton bolls will open late.
    In terms of improving the quality of cotton, this year we need to plan to plant long-staple cotton, because machines urgently need this cotton to spin fine yarn.

### 如何增加棉花产量

　　如何增加棉花产量
    ·席凤洲·
    棉花为工业上的重要原料，今后要发展纺织业，就需要大量的优良原棉。因此，如何增加棉产，是值得重视与研究的。
    历年来，由于劳畜力缺乏，施肥量减少，耕作技术粗糙，棉花产量显著降低。如太行区的高邑、武安等地，过去每亩能产二百余斤籽棉的棉田，现仅能产到百余斤甚至数十斤，其它产棉区也有同样现象。平均减产约在百分之五十以上。根据去年各地的植棉情形，很多棉花没长好，研究起来有以下几个原因：
    一、施肥问题：棉花是一种深根作物，生长期又长，没有足够的肥料是长不好的，还有的上圊粪特别多，致棉棵乱发枝叶，不见结棉桃。还有人误认为棉花不上粪也可以长好，这都是错误的。棉花不但要上粪，而且要上的合理。如油饼、圈粪、堆粪都可作底粪。如不是碱性土地还可上一些草木灰：以防棉花病害。一般薄地，也可上些人粪尿，但不要上的太多。
    二、棉花下种：这是植棉工作中一个重要问题，种的过深或过浅都不好。如去年沙河有人种的脱字棉，种到四寸多深，棉籽虽然在土里生芽，也萌不出来。也有人种的太浅，棉籽露在地面发干不能生芽。另外，种籽好坏下种时期，亦应注意，“枣芽发种棉花”就是应时下种期。如虫伤籽、不成熟籽、陈籽、种了以后都不容易生芽。一般下种量每亩应是四斤到五斤，发芽不好的籽应增加数量。
    三、注意气候：如去年在较冷地区也提倡种棉，后因秋霜太早，棉桃大部未开裂，产量很低，不如种粮食。今年我们有了广大的植棉区，可以大量种棉，不适种棉的地区，就不应该强种了。
    四、棉花管理问题：（一）棉花留苗问题：一般习惯留稠苗，结果枝叶密集不透风光，结的棉桃也少，又不容易很快开裂，还易引起病虫害。（二）棉花脱裤打杈问题：按太行区黎城、潞城、邢台等地区几年种棉花的经验，都认为棉花打杈可使棉花增产，但有些地区实验结果，认为棉花打杈不会增产。根据研究结果，打杈不打杈，应根据具体情况，如气候较冷或下种较晚的棉花，为了提前成熟多收棉花，可进行打杈。如秋雨过多或多长枝叶的棉花品种，也可进行脱裤打杈。但在气候温暖的广大植棉区、是不适合脱裤打杈的，还有一种斯字棉２Ｂ号棉花，果枝多叶枝少，一般是不必整枝的。打杈如果太迟或不得法，也会减少棉花产量。
    五、油旱虫问题：油旱虫（棉蚜）是棉花的主要虫害，去年很多棉山普遍发生这种虫害，最严重的有减产到三分之一，平均减产在百分之十以上。因此今年有计划的在植棉地区组织、指导防治油旱虫，是保证棉花增产的主要问题。治的办法，用二两生石灰和二两烟叶配成乳剂去喷治，实验很有效。
    六、如何促进棉桃及时开裂：去年各地种的棉花，到了晚秋时留下很多棉桃不能开放，产量降低。要使棉桃开裂应注意以下几点：（一）要用早熟棉花品种。（二）如遇雨水过多，洋花发杈更要多，要勤修勤打，防止乱发油条，这样果枝上的棉桃，就自然早开裂。（三）阴坡地、气候较冷的山地，可不种棉花。黑色肥土里种棉花，多长枝叶，成熟也晚。砂质土壤种棉，易透阳光，地温高，棉花开桃早。（四）圊粪不要上的太多，多了乱发枝叶，棉桃开的晚。
    在改良棉花品质上，今年需要有计划的去种植长绒（长毛棉）棉花，因机器纺细纱急需这种棉花。
