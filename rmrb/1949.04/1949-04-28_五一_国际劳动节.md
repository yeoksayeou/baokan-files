"May First" International Labor Day is a fighting festival for the working class all over the world to review their revolutionary forces.

Sixty-five years ago, in 1884, workers from all over the world gathered in Chicago to fight for the implementation of the eight-hour system for work, education, and rest. They agreed to hold a large-scale demonstration on May 1, 1886. On that day, large-scale strikes and demonstrations broke out in various parts of the United States, with no less than 200,000 workers participating. From that day on, American workers, and subsequently British and French workers, united themselves and expanded their trade union organizations in continuous struggles, forcing capitalists to gradually improve the lives of workers. Three years later, in July 1889, leaders of the international workers' movement gathered in Paris and decided to designate May 1st of each year as the International Labor Day for the working class to strive for liberation.

From 1890 to the present sixty years, the international working class has held grand "May First" celebrations every year. Despite the fact that the governments of capitalist and imperialist countries have tried every means to prevent "May First" strikes and demonstrations, and despite the fact that the traitorous social reformist parties have tried to remove the revolutionary content of "May First," which is characterized by international worker solidarity, the international working class still expresses its determination to liberate mankind from the shackles of capitalism in every "May First" celebration. This historical mission is being gloriously accomplished. The Russian working class carried out the world's first socialist revolution in 1917 and established the first homeland of the international working class - the Soviet Union. The working classes of Eastern and Southeastern European countries, during and after the Second World War, led and united other working people to establish people's democratic countries. In the Soviet Union and these new democratic countries, the working class became the leader of the regime and the master of the country. They made these countries a fortress for defending world peace and a beacon for liberating mankind. Every "May First," the workers of these countries commemorate International Labor Day with enthusiastic production competitions and demonstrations against imperialism. In capitalist countries, affiliated countries, colonies, and semi-colonies, the working class, on this day of each year, takes united action to resist the oppression and exploitation of capitalist imperialism and its running dogs.

The first time the Chinese working class commemorated "May First" International Labor Day was the demonstration held by workers at Changxindian on the Pinghan Railway in 1921. More than a thousand workers participated in this demonstration, led by Deng Zhongxia, a member of the Chinese Communist Party. Since then, the Chinese workers' movement has developed rapidly, and the strength of the working class has grown day by day. For nearly thirty years, the Chinese working class and its party, the Chinese Communist Party, have led the Chinese people in the Great Revolution, the Land Revolution, and the War of Resistance Against Japan. After arduous and tenacious struggles, they achieved great victories and tempered themselves in the struggle. Now the working class is uniting the people of the whole country in carrying out the great People's Liberation War, which is about to win final victory. This People's Liberation War, aimed at opposing imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, has continued for three years. After annihilating five million Kuomintang reactionary troops, the million-strong army of the People's Liberation Army led by the Chinese Communist Party has fully crossed the Yangtze River and occupied Nanjing, the center of the counter-revolution. The reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, representing imperialism, landlords, and compradors, has been declared extinct. A new China, led by the working class and based on the worker-peasant alliance, is being born. However, the reactionary remnants have not been completely eliminated. They have been reduced to bandits and will carry out desperate struggles. Therefore, we must make another effort to support the People's Liberation Army in completely and thoroughly eliminating all the Kuomintang bandits. When commemorating "May First" this year, the task of the Chinese working class is to strengthen its unity, raise its class consciousness, unite all working people and intellectuals, and, under the principle of benefit to both labor and capital, unite the bourgeoisie, restore and develop production, improve technology, improve product quality, reduce production costs, continue to support the People's Liberation War, and engage in the construction of the new China. Workers in the Kuomintang-controlled areas should organize to protect factories, enterprises, and public institutions from destruction by the Kuomintang bandit army. When the People's Liberation Army arrives, they should actively assist the People's Government in its takeover work and quickly restore postal and telecommunications, railway transportation, and other industrial production.

### “五一”国际劳动节

　　“五一”国际劳动节
    “五一”国际劳动节是全世界工人阶级检阅自己的革命力量的战斗节日。
    六十五年前，一八八四年，万国工人为了争取实行工作、教育、休息各八小时的三八制，集会芝加哥，约定于一八八六年五月一日举行大规模的示威运动，到了那一天，美国各地爆发了大罢工和示威游行，参加运动的工人不下二十万人。从这一天起，美国工人以及随后的英法工人，在不断的斗争中团结了自己扩大了工会组织，迫使资本家逐渐改善工人生活。三年之后，一八八九年七月，国际工人运动领袖集会于巴黎，决定每年五月一日为工人阶级争取解放的国际劳动节。
    从一八九零年到现在的六十年中，国际工人阶级便每年都举行盛大的“五一”纪念。尽管资本帝国主义国家的政府用尽千方百计来阻止“五一”节的罢工和示威，尽管工贼社会改良主义的政党力图去掉以国际工人团结为特点的“五一”节的革命内容，国际工人阶级仍然于每年“五一”节纪念中表示了使人类从资本主义桎梏下解放出来的决心。这个历史使命正被光荣地完成着，俄国工人阶级在一九一七年进行了世界上第一次社会主义革命，建立了第一个国际工人阶级的祖国——苏联。东欧和东南欧各国工人阶级，在第二次世界大战期中及其以后，领导和团结了其他劳动人民，建立了人民民主的国家。在苏联和这些新民主国家中，工人阶级成为政权的领导者，国家的主人翁。他们使这些国家成为保卫世界和平的堡垒，解放人类的明灯，每年“五一”，这些国家的工人以热烈的生产竞赛，以向帝国主义的示威游行来纪念国际劳动节。在资本主义各国、附属国、殖民地、和半殖民地国家的工人阶级，则在每年的这一天，以团结的行动来反抗资本帝国主义及其走狗的压迫和剥削。
    中国工人阶级第一次纪念“五一”国际劳动节，是一九二一年平汉铁路长辛店工人举行的示威游行。参加这次示威游行的有一千多工人，领导者是中国共产党人邓中夏。自此以后，中国工人运动猛烈发展，工人阶级的力量日益壮大，在将近三十年的时间中，中国工人阶级及其政党中国共产党，领导中国人民进行了大革命、土地革命和抗日战争，经过艰苦而顽强的斗争，取得了伟大的胜利，并在斗争中锻炼了自己。现在工人阶级正团结全国人民进行着即将最后胜利的伟大的人民解放战争，这个人民解放战争以反对帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义为目标，已经继续了三年的时间。在消灭了五百万国民党反动军队以后，中国共产党所领导的人民解放军的百万大军已全面渡江，占领了反革命中心南京，代表帝国主义、地主、买办的国民党反动统治已经宣告灭亡。一个由工人阶级领导的，以工农联盟为基础的人民民主的新中国正在诞生，但反动残余势力尚未完全消灭，他们已沦为土匪，将进行绝望的挣扎，所以还要再努一把力，支援人民解放军将国民党土匪全部彻底消灭干净。在今年纪念“五一”的时候，中国工人阶级的任务，是加强自己的团结，提高阶级觉悟，联合一切劳动人民和知识分子，并在劳资两利的原则下联合资产阶级，恢复和发展生产，改进技术，提高产品质量，减低生产成本，继续支援人民解放战争，并从事新中国的建设。在国民党统治区的工人，应组织起来保护工厂企业和公共机关，使之免遭国民党匪军的破坏；在解放军到达之时，则应积极地协助人民政府的接管工作，迅速地恢复邮电、铁路交通及其他工业生产。
