Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 21st. Zhang Ruizhen, head of the Korean youth delegation attending the First National Congress of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League, spoke to reporters today about his impressions of coming to China to attend the congress. In his speech, Zhang Ruizhen stated that the warm welcome they received along the way in cities such as Andong and Shenyang, as well as in Beiping, fully demonstrated the unity of Chinese and Korean youth and the friendship between the Chinese and Korean peoples. He believes that after arriving in the Chinese liberated areas, especially after participating in this congress, he has gained a further understanding of the victorious development of the Chinese revolution. Zhang Ruizhen said: "No matter what method is used—the Tianjin method or the Beiping method—the victory of the Chinese revolution throughout the country will come quickly. China's population accounts for almost half of Asia's population. Therefore, the victory of the Chinese people is also the victory of the Asian people and the victory of the world's peace and democracy camp. The great victory of the Chinese people will encourage all the oppressed nations of the world to resolutely carry out the struggle for national liberation." Zhang Ruizhen believes that the reason why the Chinese people were able to achieve this great victory is because of the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, and the Chinese Communist Party has gained the complete trust of the Chinese people. The achievement of this victory is also inseparably related to the strength of the democratic forces led by the Soviet Union, including the struggle of oppressed nations against imperialism. He said: "The current situation indicates that American imperialism and its running dog Syngman Rhee in South Korea are bound to perish, just as American imperialism and its running dog Chiang Kai-shek in China are bound to perish. Like the Chinese people, the Korean people firmly believe that the world peace and democracy camp will surely be victorious, and imperialism and its running dogs will surely suffer the final destruction like the German, Italian, and Japanese fascists." Zhang Ruizhen was deeply impressed by the vigorous engagement of the people in the Chinese liberated areas in war and production construction. He said: "The people in the liberated areas are full of progressive spirit, and all kinds of work are very orderly and well-organized. In particular, Chinese youth have been tempered into a conscious and strong force during the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan and the three-year War of Liberation. We hope that under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, Chinese youth will unite with the Chinese people to win greater and more glorious victories." When talking about the revolutionary friendship between the Chinese and Korean peoples, Li Chonggen, the worker representative of the delegation, excitedly said: "The Korean people are very concerned about the news of the Chinese people's victory. Especially recently, North Korean newspapers have been publishing news about China's liberation struggle every day, and Xinhua News Agency's reports have been published a lot. The Democratic Youth League of North Korea, various factories, and schools regularly report on the situation of the Chinese revolution and hold discussions. The continuous and great victories of the Chinese people are inspiring the production enthusiasm and learning enthusiasm of workers and students in North Korea."

　　朝鲜青年代表发表谈话赞扬中国人民伟大胜利
    鼓舞着被压迫民族坚决进行解放斗争
    【新华社北平廿一日电】参加中国新民主主义青年团第一次全国代表大会的朝鲜青年代表团团长张瑞振，今日向记者畅谈代表团到中国参加这次大会的观感。张瑞振在谈话中表示：在沿途安东、沈阳等城市以及来平后各方对他们的热烈欢迎，充分证明了中国青年和朝鲜青年的团结，和中国、朝鲜两民族的友谊。他认为他们到中国解放区后，特别是参加了这次大会后，对中国革命胜利发展的形势已有了更进一步的认识。张瑞振说：“不论用什么方式——天津方式或北平方式，中国革命在全国范围内的胜利必将迅速到来。中国人口几占亚洲人口的半数，因此，中国人民的胜利，同时也就是亚洲人民的胜利，世界和平民主阵营的胜利。中国人民的伟大胜利，将鼓舞全世界的被压迫民族坚决进行民族解放的斗争。”张瑞振认为中国人民所以能获得这一伟大胜利，乃是因为中国共产党和毛泽东主席的领导正确，中国共产党得到了中国人民的完全信任。这一胜利的取得，也与以苏联为首的民主力量的强大，包括被压迫民族反对帝国主义的斗争有不可分离的关系。他说：“目前形势指明：美国帝国主义及其在南朝鲜的走狗李承晚一定要灭亡，正如美国帝国主义及其走狗蒋介石在中国一定灭亡一样。朝鲜人民和中国人民一样，坚信世界和平民主的阵营一定得到胜利，帝国主义及其走狗，一定如德、意、日法西斯遭到最后的覆灭。”张瑞振对中国解放区的人民生气勃勃地从事战争和生产建设有很深刻的印象。他说：“解放区人民富于前进气概，各种工作很有秩序，很有组织。尤其是中国青年，他们在八年抗日战争与三年解放战争中，已锻炼成为一支觉悟的坚强的力量。我们希望中国青年在中国共产党和毛泽东主席的领导下，联合中国人民争取更伟大更光辉的胜利。”当谈及中国、朝鲜两族人民的革命友谊时，代表团的工人代表李重根兴奋的说：“对中国人民胜利的消息，朝鲜人民是很关心的。尤其是最近，北朝鲜报纸上每天都有关于中国解放斗争的消息，新华社的报道刊登得很多。北朝鲜民主青年同盟，各个工厂、学校经常报告中国革命的情况，并举行讨论。中国人民的不断的巨大的胜利，鼓舞着北朝鲜工人和学生的生产情绪和学习情绪”。
