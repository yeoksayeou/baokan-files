　　Eulogy for Ruo Fei
    Li Peizhi
    "To commemorate the deceased by thoroughly completing the Chinese revolution" – this was the vow made three years ago by the entire Party and the freedom- and peace-loving people of the country upon hearing the tragic news of the "April 8th" incident.

    In these three years, the people have been fulfilling their vows to complete your legacy. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, the people of the whole country are fighting day and night to thoroughly complete the Chinese revolution.

    The Chinese revolution is advancing towards the triumphal arch of victory, victory, and more victory. Ruo Fei! Today, we have victoriously entered Beiping, where you once worked underground. Soon, our red flag will be planted in Nanjing and Shanghai, where you were once pursued by the police... Although, in the joy of this great victory, your presence is not to be seen, your wish – the liberation of the Chinese nation – is being realized. You have never been separated from my heart, and will never be.

    Your noble qualities are not only manifested in your steadfastness in the struggle against the enemy, but also in your pragmatism in work, your sincerity to comrades, and also permeate your family life. You never argued with me – your wife – for personal gain. You patiently gave me a lot of help in work, policy theory, and even ideological awareness. It was only after 1942 that I, in my naivete, truly recognized your greatness. My grief is not just for losing a partner like you, but for hating that I learned from you too late! Ruo Fei! I will never forget your excellent characteristics of not caring about personal gains and losses, and will strive to learn from your legacy so that I can better serve the people. For your beloved son, I will educate him to inherit your aspirations, learn your style, and make him an outstanding descendant of yours, so that he can participate in the construction of the new China when he grows up.

    Although our lives are separated, our spirits are forever united!

　　祭若飞
    李培之
    “以彻底完成中国革命来纪念死者”，这是三年前全党和全国爱好自由与和平的人民闻悉“四八”噩耗之后的誓言。
    三年中，人民正在实践自己誓言来完成你的遗志。全国人民在毛主席领导下，日夜不停的为彻底完成中国革命而战斗着。
    中国革命正向着胜利，胜利，再胜利的凯旋门前进。若飞！今天我们已经胜利的进入了你曾在地下工作过的北平，不久我们的赤旗即将插入你曾被警察追逐过的南京上海……。虽然，在这一伟大胜利的欢笑中，没见到你的行踪，但是你的志愿——解放中华民族已在实现。你在我的心灵中，和我们未曾分离过一天，也永远不会分离。
    你崇高的品质，不只表现在对敌斗争的坚定，还表现在对工作的朴实，对同志的诚恳；而且也充溢在家庭生活中。你从未为了个人生活和我——你的妻子争吵过。在工作上、政策理论上、乃至思想意识上都耐心的给了我不少的帮助。幼稚的我，真正认识你的伟大，也只在一九四二年以后。我的伤痛，不只是为了失去你这样的伴侣，而是痛恨我向你学习得太迟！若飞！我永远不会忘去你的不计个人得失的优良特点，将努力向你的遗风学习，使自己能更好的为人民服务。对于你所钟爱的儿子，我将教育他继承你的遗志，学习你的作风，使他成为你的优秀后代，成人后使他参加新中国的建设工程。
    我们的生命虽分隔，但精神是永合的！
