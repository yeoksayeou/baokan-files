　　Providing Raw Materials and Assisting with Sales
  　Beijing Trading Company Actively Supports Iron Factories

    [Report from this newspaper] Private iron factories in Beijing are receiving active assistance and support from the People's Government. The trading companies under the People's Government supply them with the raw materials they need, exchanging them for finished products to facilitate sales. They also help them plan to reduce costs and improve quality. As of April 23, six factories, including Shengtai and Guangyong, have received more than 179,000 catties of raw iron, which they will return to the trading company in the form of finished products such as iron pots and farm tools. There are more than 630 iron factories in the city, of which more than 470 are small-scale iron factories engaged in manual production, black and white iron work, and horseshoeing. There are 160 machine iron factories, but only about 20 of them are relatively large in scale and fully equipped, capable of producing weaving machines, printing machines, sewing machines, lathes, water pumps, electric grinders, and other machines, as well as railway equipment parts, machine parts, iron pots, and agricultural implements. During the period of Kuomintang rule, due to the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang's restrictions on the export of hardware and the disruption of sales channels, and the continuous devaluation of the puppet currency, they were constantly threatened by production cuts and closures, and the entire iron industry was on the verge of collapse. After the liberation of Beijing, state-owned enterprises actively supported private enterprises that were beneficial to the national economy, and the city's iron industry was able to recover.

　　供给原料帮助推销
  　平贸易公司积极扶植铁工厂
    【本报讯】北平市的私营职工厂，受到人民政府积极帮助扶植。人民政府所属的贸易公司供给他们需用的原料，换回成品，以利推销。并帮助他们计划减低成本，提高质量。截至四月二十三日止，升泰、广永等六厂已获得原铁十七万九千余斤，他们将以铁锅、农具等成品还给贸易公司。按本市原有铁工厂六百三十余家：其中手工生产，黑白铁业，马掌业等小规模铁厂占四百七十余家，机器铁工厂一百六十余家，略具规模、设备齐全者不过二十余家，能出产织布机、印刷机、缝纫机、旋床、水泵、电磨等机器，及铁路器材零件、机器零件、铁锅及农具等。在国民党统治期间，由于蒋家匪帮限制五金出口，销路隔绝，且伪币不断贬值，经常遭受减产倒闭的威胁，整个铁工业已濒崩＠。北平解放后，国家企业积极扶植有利于国民经济的私营企业，全市职工业乃得复苏。
