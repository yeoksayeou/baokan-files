　　Wanju Tannery Mass Produces Leather Rollers
    [This Dispatch] The Xinji State-Owned Wanju Tannery in Jizhong, in order to assist the development of handicrafts, plans to manufacture 17,000 leather rollers (for cotton ginning) throughout the year and improve quality, guaranteeing that each roller can gin 6,000 jin of cotton. Last year, the factory mainly produced drive belts and leather goods (leather bags, leather saddles, gun holsters, gun belts, leather belts), so only 3,000 leather rollers were produced. With the changing situation, the liberation of large cities, and the advance of the troops, the demand for leather goods has relatively decreased. However, the important industrial raw material – cotton – is being widely planted, and the need for ginning tools will inevitably increase, so the factory has decided to focus on the production of leather rollers this year. However, the quality of the factory's products was slightly poor last year. To improve quality, workers were organized last winter to visit and study other factories in the city. When summarizing in January this year, the quantity had exceeded that of general factories, but the quality was still inferior to the "Continental Brand" products of the Qianyigong Factory in the city. Therefore, the workers' slogan now is "Strive to surpass the Continental Brand," and they guarantee a large quantity, saving raw materials, and completing 6,800 rollers before the end of July. Xinji City is a distribution center for the fur industry, and leather rollers are one of the city's special products and an important tool for cotton ginning.

　　万聚制革厂大量制皮轴
    【本报讯】冀中辛集国营万聚制革厂，为辅助手工业发展全年计划制造一万七千根皮轴（轧花用）并提高质量，每根保证轧花六千斤。该厂去年以生产轮带、皮件（皮包、皮鞍、枪套、枪带、皮带）为主，故皮轴仅生产了三千根。随着形势变化，大城市解放，部队前进，皮件用量相对减少。而重要的工业原料——棉花普遍种植，弹轧工具需要必增，故该厂确定今年以生产皮轴为重点。但该厂去年产品质量稍差，为提高质量，去冬曾组织工人到全市各厂参观、研究，在今年一月份总结时，在数量上已超过一般工厂，质量仍次于该市谦益公厂“大陆牌”产品，所以现在工人们的口号是“争取超过大陆牌”，并保证数量多，省原料，七月底以前完成六千八百根。按辛集市是皮毛业集散地，皮轴是该市特产之一，是轧花重要工具。
