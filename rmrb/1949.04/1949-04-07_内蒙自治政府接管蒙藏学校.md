　　▲ The National Mongolian-Tibetan School was officially taken over by Comrade Huang Jingtao, representative of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Government, on the 4th of this month, and he was appointed acting principal. In addition: Because the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Government urgently needs a large number of construction cadres, more than two hundred students had voluntarily signed up to go north at the end of March to participate in Inner Mongolia's construction work.
    Also: The school will enroll new students, limited to Mongolian and Tibetan youth. Registration is scheduled for the 7th, and the exam on the 8th. (Lian)
