Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan Frontline, April 23rd: The Taiyuan Frontline Headquarters Political Department and the People's Liberation Army on the Taiyuan Frontline have issued an urgent political order to arrest war criminals Liang Huazhi, Sun Chu, Wang Jingguo, Dai Bingnan, Iwata, and others. The order states: "The Taiyuan Chiang-Yan bandit leaders Liang Huazhi, Sun Chu, Wang Jingguo, Dai Bingnan, Iwata, and others have actively participated in the anti-people revolutionary war launched by Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan, and are extremely vicious and deserve to be punished. Since our army was ordered to liberate Taiyuan, in order to spare the people of Taiyuan from the damage of war, we have repeatedly advised these criminals to lay down their weapons and repent for their crimes. However, these criminals not only blatantly refused our army's advice, but also wantonly burned civilian houses, destroyed property, and released poison gas, causing heavy losses to the people of Taiyuan. Such war criminals who stubbornly refuse to repent and are enemies of the people to the end must be arrested and severely punished according to the orders of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu. To this end, we hereby order all commanders and fighters to be brave and strive to be the first to break into the city and arrest war criminals Liang Huazhi, Sun Chu, Wang Jingguo, Dai Bingnan, Iwata, and others, bring them to justice and severely punish them, and avenge our people. Do not let them escape."

Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan Frontline, April 24th: Before the People's Liberation Army entered Taiyuan, the Yan bandits in Taiyuan carried out large-scale arson and poisoning. On the 21st, the bandit leaders ordered the burning of Shouyi Pass in the South City, and residents of the largest city gate area were buried in a sea of fire. The towering fire had not been extinguished by the evening of the 22nd. The chemical plant and wool textile factory in the north of the city were also burned down. On the afternoon of the 22nd, the bandit army fired dozens of tear gas bombs at the People's Liberation Army engineering units and the Dichun People's Liberation Army at the Shahe Yanghui Bridge in the south of the city, and at the same time released multiple sneezing gas bombs at the People's Liberation Army in Yongxingbao in the north of the city. The People's Liberation Army will severely punish the war criminals who were found to have ordered and carried out the arson and poisoning.
