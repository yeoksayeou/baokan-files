　　People's Art - New Year Pictures
　　Chang Renxia
　　In feudal society, art served the feudal class. In capitalist society, art served the bourgeoisie. In today's New China, in this century of the people, it is inevitable that art serves the masses of the people. Art not only entertains the people but also guides and educates them. Art is no longer a plaything for the leisure class but is integrated with the working people. This New Year picture exhibition is a concrete manifestation of this.
　　New Year pictures are something the Chinese people are accustomed to. Every Lunar New Year, unless a family is extremely poor, almost every family likes to buy some New Year pictures, door gods, and kitchen gods. Twenty years ago, I personally collected a lot of this kind of colored woodcut painting from various places in order to study rural customs. The content of these New Year pictures, apart from the door gods and kitchen gods, which are undoubtedly products of superstition, either promoted loyalty, filial piety, integrity, and righteousness, or praised promotion and wealth. They are mostly products with feudal social toxins. Some old New Year pictures are combined with old novels and old dramas, such as those based on Romance of the Three Kingdoms, Investiture of the Gods, Water Margin, Generals of the Yang Family, Generals of the Luo Family, and so on. There are many of these. These old New Year pictures served the feudal ruling class and must be reformed in a New Democratic society. To reform, our art workers must live among the people, learn and study from the people, and be familiar with everything about the people. Then the things we create, since they grow out of the people, will always be accepted by the people. The artists of the past, who served the feudal class and capitalists, were of course detached from the masses of the people. Even if they learned from foreign works, blindly applying the techniques to New Year pictures without properly expressing the content, they would still not be welcomed by the masses. This New Year picture exhibition can be said to have corrected the shortcomings of the past, corrected the self-indulgent preferences, and truly served the people. New Year pictures have become the art of the people.
　　The content of this New Year picture exhibition, the first part, is a realistic portrayal of the soldiers' fighting, the lives of workers and peasants in the old liberated areas, the conscription movement, the production movement, the beginning of construction, and the paintings printed for children. These themes are all vivid. The second part has many styles of monthly calendars for farmers, which not only report the solar terms but also tell farmers the common knowledge they should have for farming. This common knowledge is mostly expressed in the form of ballads. The paintings on the top or sides of the monthly calendars are not only decorative but also have very vivid content. It is no wonder that this kind of artwork, which is both practical and educational, is widely welcomed and sold in large quantities in rural areas. The third part has several works with the story of The White-Haired Girl as its content. The White-Haired Girl, a new type of opera, has become something loved by the working masses of the old liberated areas. Almost every household knows this story. In the New Year pictures, it is drawn as a series of pictures, which will naturally be welcomed by the masses. The new and old artists and folk artists of the liberated areas all have works on this theme, which shows its wide influence.
　　This New Year picture exhibition is the first one I have seen. Naturally, the future development is limitless. I think we should now have a folklore museum dedicated to collecting this kind of thing, as well as photographs of people's customs, household utensils, entertainment utensils, clothing, and children's toys. We now lack such a museum for the public. Today, in our people's city, creating a folklore museum to exhibit pictures and photographs of the life of the people of New China should be of great significance. A short-term New Year picture exhibition like the current one cannot meet the needs of the masses. Extensive collection, long-term display, and a comparison between the past and the present, so that the people can understand this epoch-making change, isn't this of extreme educational value?

　　人民的艺术——新年画
    常任侠
    在封建社会里，艺术为封建阶级服务。在资本主义的社会里，艺术为资产阶级服务。今天的新中国，到了人民的世纪，艺术为人民大众服务，这是必然的。艺术不仅娱乐人民，而且指导人民，教育人民。艺术再不是有闲阶级的玩物，而是与劳动人民结合成一体的，这一次新年画的展览，便是其具体的一个表现。
    年画，是中国人民所习惯的东西，每当旧历年节的时候，除非是极其穷困的人家，几乎每家总喜欢买些年画门神和灶君。二十年前，我个人为了研究农村的民俗，曾向各地搜集不少这一类的彩色木刻画，这些年画的内容，除了门神灶君不用说是迷信的产物，其他或者是提倡忠孝节义，或者是颂祝升官发财，也多是有封建社会毒素的产物。有的旧年画和旧小说旧戏剧结合了，如取材于三国演义、封神传，水浒传、杨家将、罗家将等等的就很多，这些旧年画都是为封建统治阶级服务的，在新民主主义的社会里，就必须加以改革。要改革，我们艺术工作者，就必须生活在人民中间，向人民去学习研究，熟知人民的一切，然后创作的东西，纵是从人民中间生长出来的，总能为人民所接受。过去的艺术家，为封建阶层和资本家去服务的，固不用说脱离了人民大众，就是从外国作品中学习来的，生吞活剥的单只把技术应用到年画中来，不能适当的表现内容，也仍然是不会为大众所欢迎的。这一次新年画的展览，可以说纠正了过去的缺点，纠正了自我陶醉的那种偏好，真正为人民去服务，新年画成了人民的艺术。
    这一次新年画的内容，第一部分是战士们战斗的情形，老解放区工人农民生活的写真，参军运动、生产运动、开始建设的情形，以及为了儿童们所印的画，这些题材都是活生生的。第二部分有很多式样农民用的月份牌，不仅报告了节气，而且还告诉了农民耕作应有的常识，这些常识多是用歌诀形式表现的。月份牌上部或四旁的画，也不仅是装饰作用，都有很生动的内容。这种既有实用又有教育意义的艺术品，无怪在农村得到广泛的欢迎，大量的销售了。第三部分有几种是以白毛女故事为内容的，白毛女这一个新型的歌剧，已经成为老解放区劳动大众所喜爱的东西，几乎家喻户晓这一个故事，在新年画中，把他画为连环图画，自然能得到群众的欢迎。解放区的新旧艺人，民间艺人，对这个题材，都有作品，正可见其影响的广大。
    新年画的展览，这是我所看见的第一次，自然，将来的发展，是无限量的。我以为现在应该有一个民俗博物馆专收集这一类的东西，以及人民的风俗照片、生活用具、娱乐用具、服装和儿童玩具之类。我们现在就缺少这样的一个为大众设备的博物馆。在今天我们在人民的都市，创设一个民俗博物馆，来展览新中国人民生活的图画、照片，这意义应该很重大。单是象目前的一个短期的年画展览，是不能满足群众的需要的，广泛的搜集，长期的陈列，并且把过去的和现在的做一个比照，使人民了解这一个划时代的变革，这不是极有教育的价值吗？
