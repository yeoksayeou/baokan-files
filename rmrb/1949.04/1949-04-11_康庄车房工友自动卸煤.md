　　Kangzhuang Depot Workers
  　Automatically Unload Coal
    [Chahar News] Kangzhuang Depot workers automatically participated in unloading coal. From the 11th to the 14th of last month, a total of thirty-six train cars, approximately a thousand tons, of engine coal were transported to Kangzhuang Station. At the time, the coal platform workers were very busy, and it would have taken them more than ten days to unload if they were asked to do it. In order to strengthen transportation in support of the front lines, the workers of the locomotive section took on the coal unloading work voluntarily. On the 11th, a total of ninety workers, including locomotive trainees, traffic training classes, repair, and coal platform workers, participated in unloading coal and unloaded 485 tons in less than three hours. Thirty-four repair workers did not eat or rest at noon and unloaded 200 tons in three hours. On the 14th, Chen Qizhen and Li Guanshi, two elderly directors of the traffic section, also enthusiastically participated in the coal unloading work, which further motivated all the workers in the section. Thanks to the workers' conscious and joyful labor, this arduous task was completed in three days.

  　自动卸煤
    【察哈尔讯】康庄车房工友自动参加卸煤。上月十一至十四三天，共运到康庄车站机煤三十六车约千余吨。当时煤台工友很忙，要他们来卸，得十几天才能卸完。机务段工友们为了加强运输支援前线，自动担任了卸煤工作，十一日参加卸煤的有机车练习生、行车讲习班、检修、煤台等工人共九十人，不到三个钟头卸了四百八十五吨。三十四个检修工人正午没吃饭、没休息，三个钟头就卸了二百吨。十四日行车股主任陈起阵、李冠时两位老人，也热情地参加了卸煤工作，这一下全段工友，更起劲了。由于工人们自觉愉快的劳动，这一艰巨工作三天即完成。
