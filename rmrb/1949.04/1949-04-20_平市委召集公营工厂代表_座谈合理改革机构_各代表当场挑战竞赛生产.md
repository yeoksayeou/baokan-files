The Municipal Party Committee of Beiping Convenes Representatives of Public Factories for Discussion on Rational Reform of Institutions
　　Representatives Challenge Each Other on the Spot to Production Competitions
　　[This Newspaper] The Beiping Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened a symposium yesterday (the 19th) for worker representatives and military representatives from public enterprises and factories throughout the city. Over 210 representatives attended from more than 40 units, including the Changxindian Railway Machinery Factory, the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, the Power Plant, the Mentougou Coal Mine, the Arsenal, the Clothing Factory, the Water Company, and the Qinghe Woolen Mill. The main topics of discussion were the rational reform of public factory and enterprise institutions, the rational adjustment of personnel and wages, and the issue of restoring and developing production. After a brief speech by Comrade Peng Zhen of the Municipal Party Committee, the representatives broke into small groups to conduct lively discussions in light of the specific conditions of their respective units, unanimously endorsing the principles put forward by the Municipal Party Committee regarding rational institutional reform and personnel adjustments. After resolving some specific issues, Sun Yishu, a worker representative from the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, took the lead in proposing a production competition to all the representatives present. He declared loudly: "Based on our current production level, we, the more than 3,000 workers of the Iron and Steel Plant, dare to challenge our fellow workers from all the public factories in Beiping!" This was a battle cry that immediately stirred the whole assembly. Representatives from the People's Printing Plant, the Fengtai Locomotive Section of the Pingjin Railway Bureau, the Tram Company, the Clothing Factory, the Mentougou Chengzi Coal Mine, the Xishan Coal Mine, the Jibei Electric Power Company, the Shijingshan Power Plant, the Postal Bureau, the Telecommunications Bureau, and other units rose one after another to accept the challenge. Many representatives mentioned in their speeches the fact that production efficiency had greatly improved since liberation due to the workers becoming masters of their own affairs. Therefore, they were full of confidence in winning this production competition. Many representatives couldn't help but jump up to recite congratulatory messages and celebratory poems they had composed on the spot. The meeting did not conclude until 11 o'clock at night.
