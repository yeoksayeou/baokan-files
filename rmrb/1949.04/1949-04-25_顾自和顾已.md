Fable

　　Gu Zi and Gu Yi
　　In a small village, there were twenty-odd households. Near the village lived two families surnamed Gu, one called Gu Zi and the other called Gu Yi. They were originally brothers, but they split up due to disunity. They still lived in the same courtyard and often quarreled. One day, both brothers went to work in the fields. Gu Zi was far from home, while Gu Yi was near the village. Gu Yi was working with his head down when he suddenly heard a woman shouting from his house: "Oh no! A wolf has snatched the child away!" Gu Yi rushed back, but seeing that the wolf had not snatched his own child, he turned around and went back. At this time, his sister-in-law had approached him and asked him to chase the wolf and save his nephew, but he ignored her and went back to the field. His sister-in-law returned home crying. Gu Zi came home in the evening and saw that his wife's eyes were red from crying, and the child was missing. After asking what happened, he went to bed without eating dinner.
　　The next day, Gu Yi still went to work in the fields, while Gu Zi stayed at home, grieving and sleeping. At noon, his sister-in-law ran in, shouting: "Elder brother, please go chase the wolf and save your nephew! The wolf has snatched your nephew away!" Gu Zi slowly sat up and said slowly, "Oh! The wolf snatched your child. Remember when the wolf snatched my child yesterday, his uncle didn't care. Today, let's each sweep the snow from our own doorsteps!" Gu Yi's wife had no choice but to watch the wolf snatch her child away. Gu Yi returned in the evening and regretted it was too late.
　　This news spread throughout the village. The entire village, young and old, gathered, criticized Gu Zi and Gu Yi, and discussed ways to fight wolves and eliminate harm. After discussion, they jointly bought a piglet, placed it near the village, and selected several young and strong men with guns to wait for the wolf to come. The wolf failed to eat the piglet and was shot dead, permanently eliminating future troubles.

    一个小山庄，有二十多户人家，村边有两家姓顾的，一个叫顾自，一个叫顾已，原是一家哥俩因不团结分了家，还在一个院子里住，经常吵闹。一天哥俩都到地里作活去，顾自离家远，顾已在村边，顾已正低头干活，忽听家里有女人喊叫：“了不得了！狼把孩子刁去了！……”顾已急忙往回跑，一看狼刁着的不是自己孩子，扭头就往回走。这时了他嫂子已走近跟前，请他追狼救侄子，但他没有理睬就回到地里去了。嫂嫂哭哭啼啼回了家。顾自晚上到家看见自已女人哭红了眼睛，孩子不见了，问明情由，连饭也没吃躺到炕上就睡了。
    第二天顾已仍到地里作活，顾自难过的在家睡大觉，晌午时候他弟妹跑进来大喊大叫的说：“孩子他大伯，你快去追狼救救你侄子吧！狼把你侄儿刁走啦！”顾自不慌不忙的坐起来慢言慢语的说：“啊！狼把你孩子刁去了，你记得昨天狼刁我的孩子时候，他叔叔没管，今天咱们还是各扫门前雪吧！”顾已女人没法，只好看着狼把自己孩子刁去，晚上顾已回来听说此事，后悔已晚。
    这个消息传遍了全付，全村老少集合，批评了顾自顾已，讨论打狼除害办法，商量结果，共同买了一口小猪，放到村边，选拔几个年青强壮的人持枪等候狼来，狼吃小猪未成，就给打死了，永除了后患。
