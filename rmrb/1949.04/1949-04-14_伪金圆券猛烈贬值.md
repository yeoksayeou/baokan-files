Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 12th: The increasingly fierce wave of price increases is sweeping across major cities in the Kuomintang-controlled areas. The devaluation speed of the counterfeit Gold Yuan has far surpassed the collapse period of the counterfeit legal tender. In Shanghai, the price of rice per shi (a unit of dry measure) broke through the 400,000 yuan mark on the 10th, more than doubling in three days, nearly 20,000 times the level when the Kuomintang "reformed the currency system" last August. In addition to rice, cotton, wool textiles, matches, paper, and financial commodities such as silver dollars, gold, and banknotes have all increased by more than two times in the past week. In Fuzhou, the price of rice per shi reached a peak of 600,000 yuan on the 8th, a fivefold increase in three days. Most merchants in the city have refused to use the counterfeit Gold Yuan and the counterfeit banknotes issued indiscriminately by the Central Bank. Citizens are running around in panic, at a loss for words. In Chengdu, major commodity prices suddenly rose by one and a half times in a single day on the 7th, creating an unprecedented record. In Xi'an and Lanzhou, the prices of all goods are also soaring. More than eighty stores in Lanzhou have recently gone bankrupt and closed down. The market chaos caused by soaring prices has reached its extreme. In Kunming, the serious situation of currency inflation and soaring prices is depriving the working people of their most basic living conditions. The ranks of beggars are growing daily, crowding the streets and alleys in hundreds, on the verge of starvation. Some of them are naked, and many women have no clothing to cover their chests. Under these circumstances, more and more people in Yunnan Province are forced to armed uprisings. The anti-hunger movements of public school teachers and staff in major cities are also developing in direct proportion to the increase in prices.

　　伪金圆券猛烈贬值
    【新华社北平十二日电】愈来愈猛的物价涨风弥漫着国民党统治区各大城市，伪金圆券贬值的速度已远远超过伪法币的崩溃时期。在上海，大米每市石十日冲破四十万元大关，三天之内涨了一倍多，几为去年八月国民党“改革币制”时水平的两万倍。除大米外，棉、毛织品、火柴、纸张以及金融性商品银元、金、钞等，在过去一周内都涨了两倍以上。在福州，大米每市石八日涨到六十万元的高峰，三天之内暴涨五倍。全市商贩大多数均已拒用伪金圆券及伪中央银行所滥发的本票。市民奔走惊骇，莫可名状。在成都，七日一天内主要物价骤涨一倍半，造成了空前的纪录。在西安及兰州，百物价格亦狂涨不已。兰州商店最近已有八十余家破产歇业，由于物价暴涨所引起的市场紊乱已达极点。在昆明，通货膨胀与物价飞涨的严重情况，正在剥夺劳动人民的最低生存条件，乞丐的队伍日益增长，成百成百地挤塞街巷，行将饿死，其中有一些丝缕不挂，许多妇女胸前没有穿着遮盖。在这种情况下，滇省人民被迫而武装起义者日众。各大城市公教人员的反饥饿运动，亦与物价的上涨而成正比例地发展着。
