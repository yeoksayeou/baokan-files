Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 22nd—After three months of arduous reconstruction work, most pitheads of the Fuxin Coal Mine have resumed coal production. In January, only three pitheads in the mine were able to officially produce coal, but by the end of March, the number had reached fifteen. In March alone, the entire mine produced 103,690 tons of coal.

　　Furthermore, the Shenyang Rubber Factory No. 2, which manufactures machine belts in Northeast China, officially resumed operations on the 15th of this month. The factory was bombed and destroyed by the Kuomintang air force in November last year during the liberation of Shenyang. After the People's Government took over, all the workers worked hard and finally rebuilt the factory from the ruins.

  　大部坑口恢复出煤
    【新华社沈阳二十二日电】经过三个月来的艰苦重建工作，阜新煤矿大部坑口已恢复出煤。一月份该矿能正式进行生产的坑口只有三个，到三月底即达十五个。三月份一个月，全矿已产煤十万三千六百九十吨。
    又东北制造机器皮带的沈阳橡胶第二厂已于本月十五日正式复工。该厂于去年十一月沈阳解放时被国民党空军炸毁，人民政府接收后，经全体工人紧张工作，终将该厂从废墟中重建起来。
