　　A Prolific Crop
  　Sweet Potato

  　3,000 Jin of Sweet Potatoes per Mu
    In this year's agricultural production plan of the North China People's Government, it was proposed to plant high-yielding food crops, and the sweet potato (also known as white potato, red potato, yam) is one of these crops.
    Farmers all know that the yield of sweet potatoes can reach at least 1,000 jin per mu for local varieties. For Japanese varieties like "Victory No. 100," the yield can reach at least 3,000 jin, and up to 4,000 or 5,000 jin. Calculating four jin of sweet potatoes as equivalent to one jin of millet, at least 250 jin of millet equivalent of crops can be produced per mu, and up to more than 1,000 jin of millet equivalent. This yield is higher than that of any other food crop. At the same time, the nutritional value of sweet potatoes is not bad. According to analysis, the nutritional composition of sweet potato flour is as follows:
    Moisture: 12.27%
    Crude Protein: 6.25%
    Crude Fat: 1.02%
    Ash: 2.60%
    Carbohydrates: 70.7%
    Crude Fiber: 2.84%
    Also, each jin of sweet potato flour can generate 1,625 calories (one person needs approximately 2,800 calories per day). Therefore, in the 1949 Great Production Movement, it is of great significance to ask the masses to widely increase the production of sweet potatoes in terms of yield and nutritional value.
    Most farmers also understand the benefits of planting sweet potatoes, but they are unwilling to cultivate them on a large scale. The reasons can be summarized as follows:
    1. Sweet potatoes have a high yield, but they are difficult to store and easily rot, resulting in too much loss.
    2. The taste is not good. Eating them once or twice may be acceptable, but it becomes unappetizing when eaten as a staple food every day.
    3. Sweet potatoes require more labor than other crops to manage.
    The above three problems are all easily solved. Regarding the difficulty in storage, because sweet potatoes contain 70% water, the rotting and insect infestation of sweet potatoes are all caused by moisture. Except for the necessary seed potatoes, we can cut the sweet potatoes used as food into slices, dry them in the sun, or grind them into flour for storage, which is easier to preserve. For storing seed potatoes, simply pay attention to ventilation and remove any rotten potatoes immediately to prevent further spoilage. As for the poor taste, we can introduce several preparation methods that will surely make people enjoy eating them:
    1. Mix 30% sweet potato flour into cornmeal to steam窝头 (窩頭, wōtóu, a type of steamed cornbread). It will taste stickier, sweeter, and more fragrant than pure cornmeal. If baked into贴饼子 (貼餅子, tiē bǐngzi, a type of flatbread), the taste is even more delicious.
    2. Mix 30% sweet potato flour into wheat flour, ferment the dough, and steam馒头 (饅頭, mántou, a type of steamed bun). It will not only taste better but also rise more. It can also be used to make烙饼 (烙餅, làobǐng, a type of pancake) or烤烧饼 (烤燒餅, kǎo shāobǐng, a type of baked sesame flatbread).
    3. Steam small balls made from sweet potato flour. The taste is very good. Some farmers say that eating too many sweet potatoes often causes heartburn and chest tightness. This is because sweet potato skin contains a digestive enzyme. Using sweet potato flour to make food will not cause heartburn.
    4. Mix it into wheat flour to deep-fry油饼 (油餅, yóubǐng, a type of fried dough cake) or麻花 (麻花, máhuā, a type of fried dough twist). The taste is very fragrant and sweet.
    5. Mix sweet potato flour with water to form balls, steam them, cut them into pieces, and add them to millet to cook rice or porridge. Both are delicious.
    6. Mix it with water to form strips as big as fingers, and cook them in soy sauce soup.
    Sweet potatoes naturally require more labor, but sweet potato cultivation does not require a large amount of animal power (using livestock), but rather more human power. It does not require heavy work, and women and children can handle it. Farmers can mobilize family women and children to go to the fields. If Japanese sweet potatoes are planted, the vines are short. Just turn the vines once or twice while weeding. This can save a lot of labor.
    　　　　Cultivation Management and Harvesting of Sweet Potatoes
    The land used for planting spring sweet potatoes must be cultivated after the autumn harvest, and spring plowing should be done again in the second year. After each rain, harrowing should be carried out to make the topsoil fine to preserve soil moisture. Apply fertilizer in early May and cultivate into fish-ridge-shaped soil ridges for planting. The ridge should be wide and the middle should be a ditch to prevent spring drought and summer flooding. Sandy soil areas do not need to be ridged and can be planted on flat ground. Summer cultivation (planting after wheat stubble) mostly uses the ridge method. After the wheat harvest, the land is plowed and the ridge is raised for cultivation.
    I. Soil and Fertilizer
    The analysis results of the fertilizer composition in the soil by the North China Agricultural Experiment Station (during the War of Resistance) are: Nitrogen 0.08%, Phosphorus 0.15%-0.48%. Sweet potatoes need the most potassium fertilizer, so the soil in North China is most suitable for planting. The amount of fertilizer applied should be 1,500 jin to 2,000 jin of manure per mu. If financially possible, soybean cake can be added. In addition, special attention should be paid to applying ash fertilizer. Farmers often do not apply fertilizer when planting wheat stubble, which is actually a mistake. In the future, fertilizer should be applied in the same way as spring sweet potatoes.
    II. Cultivation Method and Planting Period
    During cultivation, bury the lower end of the sweet potato seedlings about three inches deep in the soil, irrigate to saturate, and then cover with dry soil. There is very little spring rain in North China, so watering should be continued after planting to prevent wilting. The timing of sweet potato planting greatly affects the harvest. In North China, planting in early to mid-May is most suitable. For planting wheat stubble, it must be planted after the wheat harvest. It is even better to plant in the wheat rows before the wheat harvest.
    III. Planting Density
    Farmers commonly plant 1,000 seedlings per mu, and at most 2,000 seedlings, which greatly affects the yield. According to research, 2,500 to 3,000 seedlings can be planted per mu. Farmers may wish to try it. In North China, there is little spring rain. After planting, watering should be frequent in May and June. There is a lot of rain in July and August, so there is no need to water. In September, when the vines are lush, a small amount of watering should also be done.
    IV. Management
    To prevent the moisture in the soil from being absorbed by weeds, weeding and cultivating should be done frequently to prevent evaporation. After the rain, when the ground is slightly dry, cultivate once. After the rain, when the ground is dry, the vines must be turned five or six times from the time the vine is two feet and five inches long until mid-September. The Japanese varieties have short vines, so just turn them once or twice during cultivation.
    V. Harvesting
    The harvesting time is from the Autumn Equinox to before the Cold Dew, but in warm climates, it can be extended to before the Beginning of Winter. Do not harvest too early. However, if you want to plant autumn wheat in the sweet potato field, you can harvest early-maturing Japanese varieties such as "Victory No. 100" before the Autumn Equinox to plant wheat. However, early-harvested sweet potatoes are only for eating and cannot be used as seed potatoes. During harvesting, the vines can be cut from the roots first, and then dug out with a hoe. The yield varies depending on the variety, seedling cultivation, fertilization, and planting density. Local varieties generally yield 1,000 jin to 1,500 jin per mu. Japanese varieties can yield more than 3,000 jin.
    The yield of local varieties and Japanese varieties of sweet potatoes in North China can differ by a factor of two. It is hoped that farmers will try to find more Japanese varieties to plant this year. The varieties planned to be promoted by the Agricultural Department of the North China People's Government are "Nonglin No. 4," "Victory (Kyushu) No. 3," "Victory (Kyushu) No. 4," and "Victory (Okinawa) No. 100." These four varieties have already begun to be promoted in the North China Farm in Shijiazhuang and in the North Yue, Taihang, and Jizhong regions. After the liberation of Beiping, the North China Agricultural Science Research Institute in the western suburbs of Beiping is also preparing to massively propagate and promote these excellent varieties, which have the characteristics of high yield, short and thick vines, easy to grow, early maturity, and no need to turn vines. We hope that farmers can plant more spring potatoes and summer potatoes after wheat stubble this year.

### 一种多产作物甘薯

　　一种多产作物
  　甘薯
    朱凤绥
  　一亩甘薯三千斤
    在今年华北人民政府对于农业生产计划中曾经提出要种植多产的食粮作物，甘薯（白薯、红薯、山芋）就是这种作物之一。
    甘薯的产量，老乡都知道，一亩本地种最少可收一千斤；若是日本种“胜利百号”最少可收三千斤，最多可收四五千斤；以四斤合一斤小米计算，最少一亩地可生产相当二五○斤小米的庄稼，多的可合小米一千余斤。这产量比任何食粮作物的产量都高。同时甘薯的营养价值也不坏，据分析甘薯磨成粉后的营养组成为：水分　一二·二七％粗蛋白质
　六·二五％粗脂肪　一·○二％灰分　二·六○％炭水化物　七○·七％粗纤维　二·八四％
    又每一市斤甘薯粉可生热量一、六二五卡路里（一人一天约需二、八○○卡路里）。故无论产量、营养价值等各方面，在一九四九年大生产运动中，要求群众广泛增产甘薯，是具有重大意义的。
    老乡们大部也明了栽植甘薯的利益，然并不愿大量栽培，推究原因，可有以下几点：
    一、甘薯产量虽高，但不好贮藏，易腐烂，损失太大。
    二、口味不佳，偶吃一两次觉得还可口，当做粮食每天吃就不好吃啦。
    三、甘薯较经营别种庄稼需要更多劳动力。
    以上的三个问题都很容易解决。在贮藏困难方面，因甘薯含有七○％的水分，甘薯的腐烂、生虫全是水分做怪。除必要的种薯外，咱们可把当做食粮的甘薯切成薯片晒干，或磨成粉贮藏，就易于保存。贮藏种薯，只要注意通风，发现烂薯即行捡出，即可防止腐烂。至于口味不佳，可以介绍几种制作方法，一定令人乐吃：
    一、以甘薯粉三成加入玉米面内蒸窝头，吃起来就比纯玉米面的粘、甜、香，口味很好。如烤成贴饼子，味更香美。
    二、以甘薯粉三成掺入白面，发面后蒸馒头，不但好吃还可发的大。亦可做烙饼或烤烧饼。
    三、以甘薯粉捏成小团子蒸吃，其味甚佳。有的老乡说多吃了甘薯常会烧心，胸里发闷，这是因甘薯皮有一种消化酵素，用甘薯粉做出的东西，就不会烧心。
    四、掺入白面内炸油饼或麻花，味甚香甜。
    五、以甘薯粉合水捏成团子，蒸熟切块，掺入小米内煮饭或粥均好吃。
    六、合水捏成如手指头大的条儿，在酱油汤里煮吃。
    甘薯自然需要较多的劳动力，但甘薯并不是需用多量的畜力（用牲口），而是需用较多的人力，并不需重活儿，妇女儿童都可胜任。老乡们可以动员家庭妇女儿童下地，如果种日本种的甘薯，蔓短，只要在中耕除草时顺便翻蔓一两次就可以。可节省很多劳动力。
    　　　　甘薯的栽培管理和收获
    栽春甘薯用的地，秋收后须加耕耘，第二年再行春耕，每次雨后施行耙耢，使其表土细致以保土壤水分，至五月上旬施肥，培成鱼脊形的土垄以便栽植。垄脊应宽大，中间形成沟式以防春旱夏涝，砂土地带可不用培垄，就平地栽植。夏季栽培（种麦茬儿）用垄脊式者为多，于小麦收获后，即将地耕起，培高垄脊以便栽培。
    一、土壤与肥料
    土壤中所含肥粉成分，经华北农事试验场（抗战时）分析结果：氮○·○八％，磷○·一五％○·四八％，甘薯须要钾肥最多，所以华北土壤最宜栽植。施肥量以每亩上粪一千五百斤至二千斤为宜。如经济宽裕可加施豆饼，此外应特别注意施草木灰肥。老乡们种麦茬儿多不施肥，实际是错误，今后应与春甘薯同样施肥。
    二、栽培法和栽植期
    栽培时，把薯秧下端约三寸许培于土中，灌水渗透，再用干土覆盖。华北春雨甚少，栽后应继续浇水，以防枯死。甘薯栽植早晚，影响收获甚大，华北以五月上中旬栽培最宜。种麦碴儿，则须于小麦收割后栽植。如能在小麦收获前，种于麦行间更好。
    三、栽植密度
    老乡们普通一亩种一千棵，最多二千棵，影响产量甚大。据研究，每亩可种二千五百棵到三千棵。老乡们不妨一试。在华北春雨少，种后，在五六月应勤浇水，七八月雨水很多，无须浇。九月间蔓叶茂密，亦应少量浇水。
    四、管理
    为免除土壤中水分被草吸收，应常锄草中耕，防其蒸发，须在雨后地面稍干时中耕一次。在雨后地干时，自蔓长二尺五寸起至九月中旬，须翻蔓五六次。日本种的蔓短，仅于中耕时顺带翻一二次就可。
    五、收获
    自秋分至寒露前为收获时间，但气候温暖地方可延至立冬前收，不可过早。但“胜利百号”等日本早熟种，如想要在甘薯地种秋麦，也可于秋分前收获，以便栽植小麦，但早收的甘薯只限于吃，不能做种薯。收获时可先将梗蔓从根割去，再用镢掘刨。以品种、育苗、施肥、栽植密度等不同，产量有多有少。本地种普通一亩收一千斤至一千五百斤。日本种可收三千斤以上。
    华北甘薯的产量，本地种和日本种可差一倍。希望今年老乡们种的尽可能多找些日本种。华北人民政府农业部计划推广的品种有“农林四号”、“胜利（九州）三号”，“胜利（九州）四号”、“胜利（冲绳）百号”第四品种。已在石家庄华北农场和北岳、太行、冀中各区开始推广。北平解放后，北平西郊的华北农业科学研究所也正在准备大量繁殖和推广，这些优良品种，具有产量大、蔓短粗、容易活、早熟、不用翻蔓等特性，咱们希望老乡们今年能多种点春薯和麦茬儿的夏薯。
