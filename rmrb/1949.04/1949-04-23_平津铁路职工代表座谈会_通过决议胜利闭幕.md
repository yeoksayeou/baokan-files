  　Successfully Concludes with Resolution Adoption
    [Report from this newspaper] The Pingjin Railway Workers' Representative Symposium successfully concluded yesterday (the 22nd) in an atmosphere of warmth and jubilation. The representatives held separate group meetings to discuss Commander-in-Chief Zhu De's and Comrade Li Lisan's speeches, as well as Director Guo Hongtao's report. Xu Ping, Director of the Preparatory Committee of the Pingjin Railway Workers' Union, delivered a concluding report to the general assembly, summarizing the issues raised by the representatives concerning wages, welfare, operations, personnel, production, and learning. He emphasized that the primary task of workers currently is to expedite the completion of military transport, cooperate with the People's Liberation Army in their valiant advance into the south of the Yangtze River, and liberate all of China. Deputy Director Liu Jianzhang encouraged all workers to cherish the Workers' Union and strive to learn politics, culture, and professional skills. Comrade Xiao Ming, Director of the Preparatory Committee of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, shared the experiences and lessons learned in establishing the Workers' Union, which was met with continuous applause from the audience. The representatives also passed a resolution at the meeting to extend working hours by one hour and intensify production to welcome the Red May. Zhao Zizhong, a worker representative from Zhangjiakou, said: "We must quickly complete the tasks instructed by Commander-in-Chief Zhu De and Comrade Li Lisan, so we have voluntarily set out nine covenants to guarantee increased production. I represent more than 8,000 workers on the PingSui Railway to challenge everyone to a competition." Liu Peishan, a worker representative from Tianjin, exclaimed: "The People's Liberation Army has crossed the Yangtze River, and the railway must also be built across the Yangtze River!" Li Pengnian, a worker representative from Xizhimen in Beiping, urged all representatives to bring the gains of the conference back and tell all the workers. (Chen Ji)
