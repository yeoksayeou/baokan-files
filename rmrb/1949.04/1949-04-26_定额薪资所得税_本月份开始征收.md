　　Fixed Salary Income Tax
  　To Be Levied Starting This Month
    [This newspaper reports] The fixed salary income tax rate for public educators, police personnel, and public and private sector employees in the city has been determined by the municipal government and will be levied starting this April. The salary income tax will be calculated based on the equivalent of millet catties earned by each person per month, converted to currency at the market price at the time of salary payment. If the salary is paid in currency converted from the price of millet, the tax amount will be calculated based on the millet price at the time of payment. A temporary tax threshold is set at 250 catties of millet per month; those earning below this amount are exempt from tax. Those earning above 250 catties will be taxed on the excess portion, with tax rates ranging from 4% to 15%, calculated using progressive taxation. This income tax will be withheld by each salary-paying unit at the time of salary payment, and the withheld tax amount will be declared to the Tax Bureau using the prescribed form within five days after salary payment for verification and issuance.
