　　[Hebei-East Dispatch] The Second Hebei-East District Workers' Representative Congress grandly opened in Tangshan City on the 15th of this month.

Comrade Zhang Da, representative of the Hebei-East District Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, pointed out in his speech: "The great task of building cities, developing the economy, and expanding industrial production in the future must rely on the working class to accomplish. In the New Democratic country, the working class must take on this task with the spirit of being the masters." The entire congress unanimously passed a telegram of respect to Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, resolving to go all out to restore and develop production, build new cities, support the People's Liberation Army, and rapidly liberate all of China.
