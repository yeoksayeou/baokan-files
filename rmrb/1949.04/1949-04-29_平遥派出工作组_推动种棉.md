    Pingyao Sends Work Groups
    to Promote Cotton Planting

    [Jinzhong Telegram] In order to fulfill this year's plan to plant 31,000 mu of cotton, the Pingyao County government has dispatched three work groups to key cotton-growing villages to promote this work. Before the Anti-Japanese War, the county had planted 60,000 mu of cotton, producing more than 12 million jin of cotton. In recent years, due to the rampant grain requisition by the Yan bandit army, coupled with inconvenient transportation and sluggish cotton sales, the cotton fields have decreased year by year. Before liberation last year, the county only planted more than 15,000 mu of cotton. This spring, after land reform, the peasants' enthusiasm for production has been greatly improved, and the land along the river in the sixth and seventh districts has been fully irrigated. The state-owned Fenghua Mao store has also prepared 160,000 jin of cotton seeds for the peasants, which has laid the foundation for the completion of the above plan. However, due to the relaxation of propaganda, leadership and organizational work by district and village cadres, the masses still generally have ideological concerns about being afraid of labor, low yields, and heavy burdens. For example, the seventh district originally planned to plant 8,000 mu of cotton, but now the actual statistics from various villages show that they are only prepared to plant more than 4,800 mu. Cotton seeds are generally lacking in various villages, and except for more than 1,000 jin purchased by Dapu and other villages in the sixth district, the cotton seeds prepared by Fenghua Mao remain untouched. On the 13th of this month, in addition to sending three work groups to key cotton-planting villages in the sixth, seventh, and eighth districts to promote and lead the work, the county government also instructed all districts to seize the time to conduct in-depth publicity on cotton planting and the government's policies, so as to ensure timely sowing. At present, the four key point villages of Jingdeng in the sixth district are vigorously carrying out sowing. (Ma Ming)

　　平遥派出工作组
  　推动种棉
    【晋中电】平遥县政府为完成今年种棉三万一千亩的计划，特派三个工作组前往种棉重点村进行堆动。该县抗战前一年曾植棉六万亩，产棉一千二百余万斤，近数年来由于阎匪大肆征粮，再加以交通不便，棉花销路不畅，致使棉田逐年减少，至去年解放前全县仅植棉一万五千余亩。今春经过土改，农民生产情绪均提高，六、七两区沿河土地均已灌溉完毕。国营丰华茂商店亦为农民准备了十六万斤棉种，已奠定了完成上述计划的基础。但由于区村干部放松了宣传领导组织工作，因此群众中仍普遍地存在着怕费工怕产量少怕负担重的思想顾虑。如七区原计划植八千亩棉，现在各村实际上统计起来只准备种四千八百余亩。棉籽各村普遍缺少，而丰华茂所准备的棉种除六区达蒲等村购买一千余斤外，其余则原封未动。本月十三日，县政府除派三个工作组前往六、七、八区重点植棉村进行推动领导外，并指示各区要抓紧时间进行深入宣传植棉及政府的政策，务使按时下种，目前六区敬等四基点村，正大力进行下种。  （马明）
