　　The History of Clocks and Watches
　　A full day and night consists of twenty-four hours, which, as everyone knows, represents the time it takes for the Earth to rotate once.
　　People figured out ways to divide time into hours and minutes very early on, using various methods to calculate it. Initially, candles of a certain thickness were used, marked with twenty-four sections. When one section burned down, it represented one hour, and when the entire candle burned, it represented one day. This was an ancient type of clock, but not very reliable. There was also the sundial, which used a metal rod inserted into a slanted disc divided into hours. As each hour passed, the sunlight moved the shadow of the metal rod to another section on the disc. In this way, time could be recorded from sunrise to sunset. However, the sundial became useless on cloudy or rainy days.
　　Another old method was the water clock. A clock face was placed on top of a water tank, with a small hole at the bottom through which water dripped at a constant rate. A piece of wood floated on the water surface, connected by a string to a gear. As the gear rotated, it would cause a needle on the clock face to rotate. The water in the tank was of a certain volume, enough to last for one day. As the water level lowered, the wood floating on the water also lowered, thus pulling the gear to rotate the pointer. Of course, this was not very accurate; water had to be added every day, and the water clock only had one hand, so it could only measure hours, not minutes.
　　The invention of modern clocks and watches occurred in the Middle Ages. Before then, those with the necessary intelligence and education disdained labor, while the slaves engaged in labor lacked the opportunity for education and fine tools. Therefore, the first self-made clock was only produced in a society where handicraft workers each owned their own tools and were individually members of guilds.

　　钟表的历史
    一天一夜，二十四点钟，大家都知道是代表地球自转一周的时间。
    很早就有人想法子，将时间分成时与分，利用各种办法来计算。最初是用一定粗细的腊烛，上面分成二十四格，烧了一格，便是一小时，一支烧完，就是一天。这是古式的钟表，不过不很靠得往。还有一种是日晷，用一块金属棒，插在分成钟头的斜盘上，每过一小时，日光就移动了金属棒的影子，到盘的另一格。这样，从太阳出来一直可以记到太阳落山为止。但是如果阴天或雨天，日晷就失去了效用。
    还有一个老法子，就是水钟。用一块钟面放在一个水箱上，水箱下面有一个小孔，水就不断的等速度的往下滴。水面上浮一块木头，木头上连一根线牵住一个齿轮，齿轮旋转的时候就能使钟面上的一个针跟着旋转。水箱里的水，有一定量，刚好一天流完。水低下去，水上浮着的木头也低下去，于是就牵动齿轮使指针旋转。这当然不太准确，每天还要加一次水，而且水钟只有一个针，只能计时，不能计分。
    至于现代化钟表的发明，是在中世纪。因为在这以前，有着必要的智慧和教育的人是贱视而不屑劳动的，而从事着劳动的奴隶却没有受教育的机会和精细的工具，所以第一只自制造出来，已是手工业工人自己各个占有他己的工具，而个别地又是行会会员的那一个社会了。
