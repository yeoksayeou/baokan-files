　　Shijiazhuang Education Bureau's New Measures
  　Rectifying Factory Primary Schools
  　Conscientiously Cultivating Workers' Children
    [Report from this newspaper] Shijiazhuang City has begun rectifying publicly-run factory primary schools. Of the three workers' children primary schools established by public enterprises in the city, apart from the Furlong Elementary School affiliated with the Railway Bureau, which is relatively large in scale and functioning relatively normally, the Da Xing (Cotton Mill) Junior Primary School and the Coking (Plant) Junior Primary School (with a total of 218 students) have very poor teaching results because the City Education Bureau and the factories did not have a clear understanding of cultivating workers' children. For example, in the March arithmetic test for third-grade students at the Coking Primary School, 20 out of 23 students failed. Teachers at Da Xing sometimes even physically punished students. In general, teachers at these two primary schools lack enthusiasm for serving workers, and some teachers take a perfunctory attitude towards their work. For example, Da Xing Primary School does not follow the timetable, has no fixed hours, only has two classes a day, and sometimes one class lasts for more than an hour. The Coking Primary School has made progress this spring compared to last year, but the order is still quite chaotic. Therefore, during the Lunar New Year, worker representatives raised the issue of asking the government to help run factory primary schools well at the tea party hosted by Mayor Ke Qingshi. Some workers regret their own lack of education in their youth, and now they are very concerned about their children's education. The City Education Bureau first conducted a self-examination and sent cadres to the various factory primary schools to understand the situation. After preliminary research, on March 31, it convened a meeting of representatives from the administration and trade unions of the two factories to unify and determine the leadership relationship for workers' schools: the administrative affairs of the schools are still led by the factories, and the business aspects are directly guided by the Education Bureau. That evening, it also convened a discussion with the faculty and staff of the two schools to conduct a preliminary examination and discuss rectification measures.

　　石市教育局新措施
  　整顿工厂小学
  　认真培养工人子弟
    【本报讯】石家庄市开始整顿公营工厂小学。该市公营企业所设三处工人子弟小学，除铁路局所属之扶轮完小，规模较大，工作比较正常外，大兴（纱厂）初小、炼焦（厂）初小（共有学生二百一十八名），则由于市教育局及厂方对培养工人子弟的认识不明确，致教学效果很差。如炼焦小学三年级学生三月份算术测验，共二十三个学生，不及格的二十人。大兴教员还有时体罚学生。该两处小学教员一般的缺乏对工人服务的热诚，有的教员对工作持敷衍态度。如大兴小学上课不按课程表，也没固定时间，每天只上两节课，有时一节课上到一个多钟头。炼焦小学今春比去年有了进步，但秩序仍相当紊乱。因此旧历年间，工人代表在柯庆施市长招待茶会上，曾提出要政府帮助办好工厂小学。有些工人对自己幼年失学引为遗憾，现在，他们对自己子弟的求学很关心。市教育局当首先作了自我检查，并派干部到各工厂小学了解情况，经初步研究，于三月三十一日召集了该两工厂行政与工会的代表会议，统一确定了对工人学校的领导关系：学校行政仍由厂方领导，业务方面由教育局直接指导。并于当晚召集该两校教职员座谈，进行初步检查，商讨出整顿办法。
