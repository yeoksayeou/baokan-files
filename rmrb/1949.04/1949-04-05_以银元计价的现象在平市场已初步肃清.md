　　The phenomenon of pricing in silver dollars has been initially eliminated in the Beiping market
    [This Newspaper's Report] After the Beiping Military Control Commission announced the prohibition of the buying and selling and circulation of silver dollars, it severely cracked down on a small number of merchants who manipulated the black market and deliberately disrupted finance, and has achieved significant results. The remaining black market trading of silver dollars has completely gone underground today. The phenomenon of pricing in silver dollars has been basically eliminated. According to statistics from the Beiping Branch of the People's Bank of China, among the unscrupulous merchants found to be speculating in silver dollars, gold shops, jade shops, and silk shops are the most numerous. In the cases cracked, the illegal activities of silk shops were mostly pricing in silver dollars to undermine the credit of the local currency. Gold shops and jade shops, etc., were mostly engaged in silver dollar speculation. When Hongyuan Gold Shop (seized on March 29) was conducting black market transactions, it first asked the buyer to pay on the same day and agreed to deliver the goods at a certain place the next day. When delivering the goods the next day, they temporarily changed the location to the store to pick them up, in order to evade investigation by the People's Government. After arriving at the store, they then transferred the target to the Lizhong Trading Company at No. 13 Shijia Hutong to pick them up. Although these unscrupulous merchants tried their best, they still did not escape the net of the people's law. (Yu)

　　以银元计价的现象在平市场已初步肃清
    【本报讯】北平军管会于公布禁止银元买卖流通后，对操纵黑市，蓄意扰乱金融的少数商人曾严加取缔，并已收到显著效果，残存的银元黑市交易在今天已完全陷入偷偷摸摸状态。以银元计价的现象，基本上肃清了。根据人民银行北平分行的统计，在查获作银元投机买卖的奸商中，以金店、玉器店、绸缎庄等行业为多，在破获各案件中，绸缎庄违法行为多是以银元计价破坏本币信用。金店、玉器店等则多为从事银元投机买卖。鸿源金店（三月二十九日查获者）在进行黑市交易时，先令买方当日交款，约定次日某地交货。及次日交货时，又临时改向店内去取。以逃避人民政府的查缉。及至店中，再转移目标去史家胡同十三号利中贸易行去取。这些奸商们虽然想尽了办法，但是最后还是没有逃出人民的法网。（宇）
