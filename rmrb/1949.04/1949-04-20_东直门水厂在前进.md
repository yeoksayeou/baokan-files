　　Looking north from outside Dongzhimen, a large water tower and a straight chimney stand among the interwoven branches of trees. This is the Beiping Dongzhimen Water Plant. Here, one hundred and fourteen workers and twelve staff members are working tirelessly to provide drinking water for the citizens of Beiping.
　　In the past, under the rule of the feudal comprador class, the employees suffered for decades for the sake of food and clothing. They had no status or right to speak, and they labored day and night, and their earnings often could not support their families.
　　After the liberation of Beiping, under the leadership of the Military Control Commission representatives, they began to enthusiastically study revolutionary principles and various policies, and to study New Democracy. The entire plant formed seven study groups and a literacy class to discuss political issues and learn culture. Through study, they understood why they were working, who they were working for, and their enthusiasm and sense of responsibility for their work were significantly improved. In the past, they did not cherish equipment and there was a lot of waste; now everyone consciously realizes that they are the masters of the factory, and they use various methods to save resources. Yang Shutong, a craftsman in the foundry, found all the broken lead powder cans that had been thrown away in the past, repaired them slightly with fire-resistant clay, and melted the copper again once or twice. On their way to work, they picked up all the discarded pieces of pig iron in every corner of the factory. After a period of time, they accumulated a considerable pile. The workers on duty in the engine room used to just ensure that the machines were running and the water was sent out, considering that they had completed their task. Now it is different. They constantly caress each machine as if they were admiring their own antiques, fearing that they will overheat, and constantly wipe them with cotton yarn. The machine repair room undertook the task of manufacturing 200 water turbine tanks for water meters. Different sized oblique holes had to be drilled around the water turbine tanks. In the past, the workers would take it straight to the drill press to drill holes, and they could only drill 30 water turbine tanks a day, because the water turbine tanks were round, the drill bit would slip and break. Now, after Dong Fengzao and Bai Jinsheng, two craftsmen, automatically researched, they found a piece of pig iron and made a simple and practical tool, which can drill 50 water turbine tanks a day. The 200 water turbine tanks were completed ahead of schedule, and only one 3.5mm drill bit was broken.
　　This movement to improve tools and actively increase production is now in full swing. The craftsman Tang Yongmao is also planning to heat and flatten the previously short waste oil steel knife tips, weld them to other water steel knives, and use them as oil steel knives. It is said that this plan will definitely be successful.

### 东直门水厂在前进

　　东直门水厂在前进
    走出东直门向北看，在一些枝干交织的树林里耸立着一个大水塔和一个笔直的烟囱。这就是北平东直门水厂。这里有一百一十四个工人和十二个职员在为着北平市民饮料的供给不停息地工作着。
    以往职工们为了衣食，在封建买办阶级统治下受苦了数十年，他们一直没有地位，没有说话权，只是不分昼夜地劳动，劳动所得，时常不能养家活口。
    北平解放后，在军管会代表领导下，他们开始热心地学习革命的道理和各种政策，学习新民主主义。全厂组成七个学习小组和一个识字班，讨论政治问题，也学习文化。经过学习，他们了解了为什么工作，为谁工作，工作的热情与责任心有了显著的提高。以往他们对于器材并不爱护，浪费现象很多；现在大家自觉到自己是工厂的主人了，便用各种方法节省起来。翻砂房的工匠杨书桐把从前扔了的破铅粉罐都找了出来，用耐烧的土质略加修补，又多化了一次至二次的铜。他们在上班的路途中，把厂中每个角落里扔弃的碎生铁都拾了回来。这样经过一个时期，便积聚了相当数量的一堆。机房值班的工人们，以往是只要机器转动，能把水送出去，就算交了差。现在不然了，他们对于每一台机器，都象欣赏自己的古玩一样不断的抚摸惟恐发热，又用棉纱不断揩拭。修机房承制了二百个水表的水轮罐，在水轮罐周围必须打上大小不同的斜孔。在从前，工人们就一直拿到钻床上去钻孔，一天也不过只能钻三十个水轮罐；因为水轮罐是圆的，所以钻头一滑就折断了。现在经过工匠董凤藻和白金声自动研究，找了一块生铁块，做了一个简单而实用的工具，每天可以钻五十个水轮罐。二百个水轮罐便提早完成了，只折了一个３．５ｍｍ．的钻头。
    这种改进工具，积极增产的运动，现正方兴未艾。工匠唐永茂又在计划把以往短的废油钢刀尖加热打扁，焊在别的水钢刀上，拿来做油钢刀用。这个计划，据说也肯定能够成功。
