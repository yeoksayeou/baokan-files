　　Jincheng
  　Militia Inspection
    [Taiyue Telegram] In order to mobilize the militia to participate in production and strengthen rear area security work, Jincheng held a large-scale militia inspection from March 30th to April 2nd. Thirty-five militia field companies participated in the inspection. The conference first conducted weapons inspections. Among the 2,320 rifles inspected, only 13 percent had clean barrels, chambers, and bolts; 1,374 were generally not very clean, and 536 had the most severe rust and grease. Everyone agreed that weapons maintenance was too poor. On the second day, military tests were conducted. 80 percent of the militia scored above ten rings in shooting, and 90 percent threw grenades over thirty meters. Many militia members even created higher records. For example, Pei Shoufu from the Sixth District scored 26 rings with three shots, and Ge Fengli from Zhanglukou in the Eighth District and Zhang Manxiao from the Ninth District threw grenades over fifty meters. Political tests were worse than military tests. Before the meeting adjourned, the county magistrate called on the militia to actively participate in the great production movement, organize labor mutual aid, and strive to be models. The county party secretary gave specific instructions to the militia to strengthen security work and be ready to participate in the war at any time.

　　晋城
  　检阅民兵
    【太岳电】为动员民兵参加生产与加强后方治安工作，晋城于三月三十日到四月二日，举行民兵大检阅。参加检阅的有三十五个民兵野战连。大会首先进行武器检查，在被检查的两千三百二十支步枪中，枪筒、枪膛和枪栓擦得干净的，仅占百分之十三；一般不很干净的一千三百七十四支，生锈、油腻最厉害的五百三十六支，大家认为武器保管太差。第二天进行军事测验，打靶在十环以上的占百分之八十，投弹在三十米以上的占百分之九十。有不少民兵更创造了较高的纪录。如六区裴守富三枪打了二十六环，八区张路口葛凤理、九区张满小等投弹超过五十米。政治测验较军事测验成绩为差。散会前，县长号召民兵积极参加大生产运动，组织劳动互助争取模范。县委书记并具体指示民兵加强治安工作，随时准备参战。
