The old certificate shall be recalled, and the new certificate shall be effective from the date of exchange.
    Article 16: When trademarks for which registration certificates are reissued in accordance with Articles 14 and 15 have the same name as other registered trademarks, the Industry and Commerce Department of this government shall make a ruling based on the order of their production, the quality of their products, and the quantity of their products. If the application is not approved, the registration may be revoked, or the applicant may change to another trademark or add a note and register separately.
