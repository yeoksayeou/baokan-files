　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 4th: The "Free Tribune" correspondent in Washington reported on March 31st from Prague: The ambassadors of the North Atlantic Treaty countries recently held a meeting in Washington to discuss the organization of anti-communist "trials" in the United States and Western European countries, planning to slander the communist parties and communist sympathizing groups in various countries. The U.S. State Department will fully support any country that decides to conduct anti-communist "trials" by collecting so-called "evidence of national harm" to accuse the Communist Party. It is reported that "witnesses" specially selected from U.S. military occupied areas will appear in court to "testify" during the anti-communist "trials." The selection, training, and command of these "witnesses" are entrusted to the so-called "research institutions" in New York that train spies. The meeting of the ambassadors of the North Atlantic Treaty countries unanimously agreed to strengthen the propaganda campaign in the United States and Western Europe to defame the Soviet Union and representatives of the People's Democratic countries.

  　阴谋在西欧各国组织反共“审讯”
    【新华社北平四日电】塔斯社布拉格三月三十一日讯：自由论坛报驻华盛顿记者引可靠方面的消息称：北大西洋公约各国大使最近在华盛顿举行会议，讨论了在美国及西欧各国组织反共“审讯”的问题，计划污蔑各国共产党及同情共产党的团体。美国国务院对任何决定进行反共“审讯”的国家搜集所谓“危害国家的罪证”来控告共产党，将予以全力支持。现据出境美军占领区内被特别挑选出来的“证人”，将在反共“审讯”时出庭“作证”。这些“证人”的挑选、训练和指挥，都委托给纽约训练间谍的所谓“研究机关”办理。北大西洋公约各国大使会议并已一致同意，加强美国及西欧诽谤苏联及人民民主国家代表的宣传运动。
