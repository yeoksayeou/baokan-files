Southern Hebei Farmers Widely Plant Cash Crops
　　Six Million Mu Ready for Sowing
　　Yuanchao and Other Counties Actively Accumulate and Purchase Fertilizer

[Southern Hebei Dispatch] The plan for planting cash crops in Southern Hebei has been largely completed. Now that Qingming has passed, preparations are being made for sowing. According to statistics from various places, the entire area plans to plant 5,053,327 mu of cotton and 1,017,811 mu of peanuts, accounting for 19.81% of the cultivated land. Compared with the original plan, peanut planting exceeds the target by 7,800 mu, while cotton planting is still short by 196,673 mu. Areas that have done relatively well in this work include Yuanchao and Guanxian, where peanut planting has exceeded the original target. The basic reason for their success is the correct leadership of Party branch members and village cadres, in-depth publicity, and leading by example. In the third district of Yuanchao, under the leadership of Party members and village cadres, 78 households lent out 12,269 jin of peanut seeds and grain, solving the seed difficulties of 200 households. Hongzao Qiangqinghua Village promoted increased cotton planting throughout the village by specifically calculating accounts for typical households, demonstrating the greater benefits of cotton cultivation. However, some areas have adopted incorrect approaches. For example, cadres in Wuyingzhuang Village in the fifth district of Guantao only held one general meeting in the village and then registered how much each household would plant, causing public concern. Some villages in Zhendang County simply used the method of self-reporting and public discussion by *li*, with execution approved by the village assembly. Some villages in Wei County even averaged the assignments to each household: three and a half mu of cotton, one mu of peanuts, and half a mu of sesame for every ten mu of land. Work was only generally called for, without sufficient specific assistance to the masses, and the working methods were not fully researched. These incorrect practices have been criticized. Given the actual difficulties faced by the masses in some areas of Southern Hebei (such as the scarcity of spring land, difficulty in adjusting; lack of seeds; no past planting habits, and ideological obstacles: fear that they will not be able to sell what they grow; fear of increased levies; even superstitions that this year "ten dragons govern the water" and that multiple harvests will come early), it is necessary to help the masses thoroughly solve these problems in order to transform this year's great production movement into a mass movement and achieve the hope of planting more cotton and peanuts and increasing yields this year. Currently, the third and fourth special administrative offices of the area are inspecting the work, re-mobilizing in the counties that have not completed the task, and sending county and district cadres to the villages to help the masses formulate plans.

[Southern Hebei Dispatch] Farmers in various parts of Southern Hebei are actively accumulating fertilizer. Yuanchao County has a total of 269,768 mu of spring land and has already delivered 581,759 cartloads of manure. There are still 400,767 cartloads of manure to be accumulated, ready to be added to the peanut fields. After ten days of publicity and mobilization, the third district plans to buy an additional 2,152 pigs and build 1,550 new pigsties and manure pits. The district has also accumulated more than 300,000 cartloads of fertilizer and purchased large quantities of coarse grains as fertilizer, as well as 30,000 jin of oil cakes. The Qigang Yaotou branch, in order to ensure the realization of the plan to increase grain production by ten jin per mu, convened a forum for production models and fertilizer accumulation experts. After the meeting, they used practical examples of more manure leading to more grain to mobilize the masses to buy fertilizer. Within five days, they bought more than 22,000 jin of oil cakes. Houmafang in Linzhang uses a lot of ash soil, street soil, and dirty water to fill pits and compost manure. Yang Wanqing and Yang Shou alone have composted 30 large cartloads, averaging more than one cartload per mu. The spring land in the village has now been plowed and harrowed, and a new upsurge of collecting and composting manure has been launched, ready to apply fertilizer again when the seedlings emerge. Farmers in Wuxun, Xin County, Guantao, Xiazhen, Qinghe and other counties, under the condition of expanded cotton fields requiring a large amount of fertilizer, are constantly accumulating, collecting, and composting manure. At the same time, Party and government leading organs at all levels are taking various measures to vigorously help farmers solve the fertilizer shortage. Ren County in the fourth special administrative area has lent out 170,000 jin of oil cakes. Nanning County's cooperative plan is to lend and sell 400,000 jin of fertilizer in April. In addition, Linqing City organized 120 manure collectors to sweep the streets and collect ash soil, human and animal urine and feces, accumulating a large amount of fertilizer to supply the countryside. Farmers are now flocking to the city to purchase fertilizer.

　　冀南农民广植经济作物
    六百万亩准备播种
  　元朝等县大量积肥购肥
    【冀南电】冀南经济作物种植计划大体完成，现清明已过，准备播种。据现有各地材料统计，全区合计植棉五百零五万三千三百二十七亩；花生一百零一万七千八百十一亩，共占耕地百分之十九·八一，和原计划比较，花生超过七千八百亩，棉花尚差十九万六千六百七十三亩。在这一工作上做得比较好的如元朝、冠县等地，种植花生均超过原布置数。其成功的基本原因，是由于支部党员及村干部正确领导，深入宣传，带头领导。元朝三区在党员、村干部带头下，有七十八户贷出花生种和粮食一万二千二百六十九斤，解决了二百户的种籽困难红枣强清华村是通过典型户具体算帐，证明种棉利大，推动了全村群众多种。但有些地区的作法是错误的，如馆陶五区五营庄村干部，在村上只开了一个大会，就挨户登记种多少，使得群众疑虑。振堂县有些村单纯用以闾为单位自报公议的方式，由村民大会通过执行。威县有的村则对各户平均布置：十亩地种三亩半棉花、一亩花生、半亩芝麻等，工作只一般号召，而具体帮助群众不够，工作方法也未作充分研究。这些错误作法，均已受到批判。按冀南区部分地区群众实际困难（象春地少，调剂不开；种籽缺乏；过去没有种植习惯，以及思想上的障碍：怕多种以后卖不来钱；怕多种多征；甚至迷信今年“十龙治水”多种谷收获早之类）确实存在，应该帮助群众彻底解决，才能使今年大生产运动，形成群众运动，才有达到今年多种棉花、花生并增加产量的希望。现该区三、四专署正在检查工作，在未完成的县份再作一次动员，并派出县、区干部到村帮助群众订立计划。
    【冀南电】冀南各地农民正大量积肥。元朝县共有春地二十六万九千七百六十八亩，已送粪五十八万一千七百五十九车，尚有四十万零七百六十七车积粪，准备追加在花生地中。三区经十天宣传动员，准备添买二千一百五十二个猪，垒新猪圈、粪坑一千五百五十个。该区并已积肥三十余万车，并买下大宗粗粮作肥料，油饼三万斤。七刚尧头支部为保证实现每亩增产十斤粮计划，召集了生产模范、积肥能手座谈会，会后以多上粪多收粮的实际例子动员群众买肥，五天内买了二万二千余斤油饼。临漳后马坊多用灰土、街土、脏水填到坑里沤粪。杨万清、杨守二人即沤出三十大车，每亩地合一车多。现该村春地已犁耙完毕，又掀起拾粪沤粪热潮，准备苗子出来，再施一次肥。武训、莘县、馆陶、夏津、清河等县农民，在扩大了棉田需要大量肥料的情况下，正时刻不停的积粪、拾粪、沤粪。同时，各地党、政领导机关正采取各种措施，大力帮助农民解决缺肥困难。四专区任县贷出油饼十七万斤。宁南县推进社计划在四月份贷、售肥料四十万斤。一专区莘县贷发四十万人民币买肥料。此外，临清市区组织了一百二十个粪夫打扫街道收集灰土及人畜尿粪，大量积肥，供给农村，现农民正纷纷进城购买。
