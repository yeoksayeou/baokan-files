Explaining the Nature and Purpose of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives
	Shijiazhuang Trains Supply and Marketing Cooperative Members
[Report from this newspaper] Since February, the supply and marketing cooperatives in each district of Shijiazhuang City have stopped developing new members, using this time to conduct member education. The general approach has been to focus on key areas first, starting with one branch and then expanding to other districts. Currently, each district has generally completed the member education work for one or two branches. The district cooperative draws out certain cadres to cooperate with branch cadres, and through street chiefs and neighborhood heads, divides groups according to region and number of people (each group ranging from seven to fifteen people). They convene meetings separately, elect group leaders, and then produce group leader representatives from among the group leaders. At the group leader representative meeting, they explain the tasks of the cooperative and the rights and obligations of the members. Then, cooperative cadres, in coordination with group leader representatives, go deep into the masses to understand the masses' understanding and opinions of the cooperative, while explaining the nature, purpose, and rights and obligations of the members of the supply and marketing cooperative. Based on the findings of the in-depth investigation of the masses, a member conference is convened for education and explanation. According to the cadres of the Fourth District Street: the masses are more enthusiastic about attending meetings convened by the cooperative than other meetings.
	After such organization, some members are closer to the cooperative than before. In addition to knowing that they can buy cheaper things, they can also actively report to the cooperative any violations of the cooperative's rules and regulations. For example, a member of the Third District said: a neighborhood head in Telegraph Bureau Street is using someone else's name to subscribe for more shares, and a member at No. 4, Wuzi Hutong, Zhengyi Street, is lending out his membership card.
	The preliminary experience in organizing member education has revealed the following points: (1) Although the general members' understanding of the cooperative is vague, they spontaneously support the cooperative from their own practical interests. In February, although member purchases were not high due to falling prices, there were still many who wanted to join. Although there were some who withdrew, the reasons were either that they did not meet the requirements for membership and were rejected; or that they had moved back to their hometowns, were experiencing special difficulties in life, and withdrew one share after subscribing to two. Generally speaking, there were no withdrawals due to dissatisfaction with the cooperative. (2) The time of urban people is more valuable, so convening member gatherings should have rich content that can attract members. It is not enough or convenient to simply adopt the form of general large lectures. Written publicity can be used for education (blackboard newspapers are also a good way). (3) In the work of organizing education, pay attention to cultivating positive activists with good backgrounds. The biggest feature of the urban cooperative is that the members are mostly small merchants, and so are the branch cadres. Therefore, promoting and adjusting the leadership composition of the cooperative from the lower-level members is an important task for running the cooperative well.

　　 讲解供销社性质目的
     石市训练供销社员
    【本报讯】石家庄市自二月份起，各区供销社均停止发展新社员，利用这段时间进行社员教育。一般是采取了重点进行办法，先从一个分社再推广及其他各区，现各区一般都作完了一个或两个分社的社员教育工作。区社抽出一定干部，配合分社干部，通过街长、闾长，依据区域、人数划分小组（每组七人至十五人不等），分别召集会议，选举组长，在组长中再产生组长代表。在组长代表会上，讲解合作社之任务，社员之权利与义务。然后由合作社干部配合组长代表深入群众，了解群众对合作社之认识及意见，同时讲解供销合作社之性质、目的及社员之权利与义务。根据深入群众调查所得，再召开社员大会，进行教育及解释。据四区街干部谈：合作社召开会议，群众比开其他的会要踊跃一些。
    经过这样的组织，部份社员对合作社比以前靠近了，除知道可以购买便宜东西外，并能主动地把某些违反合作社规章的事，反映给社方。如三区有一位社员谈：电报局街有一个闾长顶他人名字多入股，又正义街五子胡同四号的某社员出借社员证。
    组织社员的教育，初步的体验到以下的几点：（一）一般社员对合作社的认识，虽然模糊，但从自己实际的利益中，是自发地在拥护合作社。二月间，虽因物价疲落，社员购货不多，但要求入社者仍然很多。退社的虽有，考其原因有入社不合章程被洗刷者；或系迁移回乡，生活特殊困难，入两股退一股。一般说因对合作社不满而退出者还没有。（二）城市人民的时间是较为宝贵的，因之，召集社员集会，应该具有能吸引社员的丰富内容，仅是采取一般上大课的形式还不够或不方便，可用文字宣传进行教育（黑板报亦是很好的方式）。（三）在组织教育工作中，注意培养成份好的积极分子。在市民合作社中的最大特点是社员系小商人成份者占极大多数，而分社干部亦如此。因此从下层社员中，提拔与调整合作社的领导成份，是办好合作社的重要工作。
