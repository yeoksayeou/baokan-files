The Farmer Service Station, piloted by Shijiazhuang City Supply and Marketing Cooperative in this city, has solved the food and lodging problems of nearly one thousand farmers who have come to the city in the past two months, and has supplied farmers with more than 400 tons of coal at low prices. Each farmer saves at least 20 yuan RMB on average for one meal and one night's accommodation. The price of coal is on average 10% lower than the market price. In addition, it also helped these farmers sell and purchase goods such as: cotton, homespun yarn, homespun cloth, millet, wheat, wheat bran, bran, cabbage, yam, salt, sesame oil, cottonseed, fertilizer waterwheels, farm tools... and all kinds of odd things. These farmers who have been taken care of have actually realized that the people's government is taking care of them more and more thoughtfully.

Before the opening of the service station, the following surveys and studies were conducted: 1. Understand the situation and general requirements of farmers after entering the city. 2. Investigate the supply and demand relationship and material exchange between the city and the countryside. 3. Investigate the farmers' dealings with the market and the places where they eat and live. Then, people were sent to Zhao County, Lecheng, Yuanshi, and Huolu counties to carry out publicity, and backbone liaison personnel were established in more than 40 villages. Advertisements were also distributed and oral publicity was carried out in the surrounding 26 counties in coordination with administrative and county/district production promotion agencies. The service station was decorated like a rural "travelers' inn". Later, a "ladle" was hung on the door. This is a familiar sign for farmers, indicating that this is a place where food, lodging, and fodder are available.

How to operate the business?

At the beginning of the pilot operation, the service station adopted a "mixed business of cart inn and warehouse." Although cart inns and warehouses are places close to farmers, their business objects are to facilitate merchants and serve as intermediaries to help merchants exploit farmers. The service object of the Farmer Service Station is the opposite of the intention of cart inns and warehouses, which is to facilitate farmers. Therefore, this business method can only take its place close to farmers, but cannot have its old content. At the beginning of the establishment of the service station, this point was not clearly understood, so it once worked for individual merchants, but it has been quickly corrected.

In order to solve the various requirements of farmers after entering the city, it is necessary to first establish close contact with various enterprise departments, and ask each enterprise to assist in collection and purchase, to ensure that the farmers introduced by the service station will not suffer losses in their transactions, and to provide as much convenience as possible. The service station has put in a lot of effort in this work, but the needs of farmers are diverse, and it is necessary to establish business relationships more universally. In addition, in the two months of trial operation, the difficult problems felt are: first, whether the service station itself should operate goods. If it only bears the responsibility of introduction, the quality of the goods transported by farmers is not uniform, and they are scattered, such as a few feet of cloth, a few pounds of cotton, dozens of pounds of grass, and some unpopular consumer goods, such as a few pounds of honey, a few pounds of medicinal materials... and unpredictable scattered items. If these are introduced one by one, there are indeed many difficulties. If the service station itself receives it, because some things may not be sold quickly, the accumulation of funds and the outlet of things cannot be handled. If these scattered things are not helped to be sold, then these difficulties of the farmers have not been solved. Especially those who hold scattered things are mostly poor and honest farmers who bring them themselves. In this situation, the service station has received them in this pilot work. Fortunately, there are not too many things. In order to cope with more such situations in the future, it is necessary not only to contact various factories and shops, but also to extend the contact to direct consumers and merchants from afar. Now, some organs are automatically ordering yams from the service station for their meals, and cart inns are ordering hay, which not only reduces intermediate procedures, but also truly achieves the purpose of serving the convenience of both buyers and sellers. However, if direct contact with consumers is widespread, it will be overwhelming, so it is even more important to further establish close contact with existing cooperatives, so that the service station can avoid operating business as much as possible.

More than 90% of the farmers who have been taken care of these days are from nearby counties. In addition to asking the service station to sell them coal, the biggest requirement is to solve their food and lodging problems. Farmers in the vicinity and more widely still seek the market for buying and selling after entering the city. That is, not enough farmers arriving at the service station automatically request help in buying and selling. To solve this problem, the service station will try to set up a sample exhibition room for farmers' various needed items and things that farmers request to sell on consignment after expanding the address. These samples are from various enterprises and farmers who request consignment sales, and the prices are marked, so that farmers can find all kinds of things they need in one room, and city people who want to buy agricultural products or agricultural and sideline products can also go to this room. After selecting the samples, introduce the transaction.

The service station's funding problem is, in principle, self-sufficient. Its source is the slight addition of profit to the goods supplied to farmers by various public enterprises at the lowest prices and resold to farmers. For example, the coal supplied to the service station by Zhengtai Coal and Iron Store at cost, the service station adds profit, which is still 10% lower than the market price, and the surplus here is used to supplement the free accommodation and non-profit meals and other business expenses. It is expected that it can be maintained in the future.

Improvement of working methods

More and more farmers are entering the service station every day. The items they carry range from scallions, chives, mustard, garlic, grains and miscellaneous grains, as well as various agricultural by-products and rural sideline products, as well as industrial products and consumer goods in transit. In addition to purchasing predictable industrial products and consumer goods, the things that farmers want to do in the city are as small as a few iron nails and getting a prescription filled at the pharmacy. They are not used to developing procedures such as single receipts. When storing goods at the service station, they often put them down and leave, and take them themselves when they pick them up. Therefore, in the work, we must pay attention to not stipulating many complicated procedures, and on the other hand, we must pay attention to patiently persuading farmers to be willing to accept some necessary procedures.

Recently, a dozen staff members have been taking care of the scene of less than a hundred people coming and going every day, starting from sending fellow villagers on the road before dawn until midnight. They forget their fatigue and have no complaints, but this is not a solution after all. There is a serious problem here, which is the scientific division of labor and the staff's familiarity with various things in the city. Originally, such complex and trivial work is prone to being passive, and the staff lacks knowledge of market conditions and various goods, and there is no scientific division of labor, which makes it even more passive and chaotic. At present, the service station is studying detailed division of labor and stepping up business learning to improve work efficiency, otherwise this will become a major obstacle in the progress of the business.

Because farmers have had many experiences of suffering losses in the city in the past, they always ask questions about buying and selling for fear of being cheated, especially the most worried about the "weight." Therefore, the farmers who come to the service station for the first time are very worried and often check the service station's scales. When farmers come to the service station for the second and third time, they often hear them say: "Your scales here are very accurate." It can be seen that they have also checked it when they went back. Therefore, being responsible, keeping promises, and thinking more for farmers are prerequisites for promoting this work.

Most of the farmers who come and go are from the old liberated areas. They have lived a democratic life for a long time, and generally have a considerable political level. In the service station's publicity work, when mentioning that the farmer service station is the Communist Party's policy and is run by the government, and explaining the service station's tasks and intentions, they are most welcome and believe it most. Therefore, in the clothing of the service station staff, some people initially suggested that all wear casual clothes in order to be close to the farmers; however, the facts these days have proved that the farmers are not as natural and kind to the few staff comrades who wear casual clothes as they are to the comrades who wear uniforms. On the contrary, they are still somewhat unaccustomed to the dress of city people, although this is only a matter of focusing on the form, and it should also be paid attention to at the beginning of the opening.

Based on the above situation, I feel that the political level of the comrades working here is very important. The workers here must be able to get close to the farmers, understand their difficulties, and still plan for them. Equally important is to be familiar with everything in the city, otherwise the service will not be thorough. At present, the cadres of the service station are working hard to study this.

　　石家庄市农民服务所试办中的几个问题
    夏景凡
    石家庄供销合作总社在本市试办的农民服务所，两月来解决了将近一千农民来到本市的食宿问题，并以低价供给农民煤炭四百多吨。每个农民平均在一顿饭和一宿的开支上至少就节省二十元人民币。每斤煤炭平均低于市场百分之十。另外还帮助这些农民推销和购买的货物有：棉花、土纱、土布、小米、小麦、谷糠、麸子、白菜、山药、食盐、香油、棉籽、肥料水车、农具………等和一切零星东西。这些被照顾的农民已实际体会到人民政府对他们的关照越来越周到。
    该所没有开业前，首先做了以下几项调查研究：一、了解农民进城后的情形及一般要求。二、调查本市与乡村的供求关系和物资交流情形。三、调查农民与市场来往情形和食住的地方。接着一面派人到附近赵县、乐城、元氏、获鹿等县进行宣传，并在四十余村建立骨干联系人员，又在周围二十六县内配合行政与县区生产推进社散发广告，和进行口头宣传；该所布置得象乡间“起火店”一样，后来大门上挂起一个“笊篱”。这是农民所熟悉的记号，它说明着这里是个可以食宿与草料具全的地方。
　　如何经营业务？
    对于该所在试办之初采用“大车店和货栈的混合业务”，由于大车店与货栈虽是农民接近的地方，但它的业务对象是为商人谋方便，是帮助商人剥削农民的居间者。而农民服务所的服务对象正与大车店与货栈的意图相反，是专为农民谋方便的。因此利用这一业务方式只能取它与农民接近的地方，而不能有它旧的内容。这在该所成立之初，对这一点认识不够明确，因而曾为个别商人奔走过，但已很快的纠正了。
    为了解决农民进城后的各式各样要求，必须首先与各企业部门取得密切联系，请各企业协助代收代购，保证对该所介绍去的农民的买卖上不能吃亏，并尽量给予方便。这一工作该所已经下过不少工夫，但农民的需要繁多，还须要更普遍的建立业务关系。另外在两个月的试办中感于难以解决的问题，首先是服务所本身要不要经营货物，如本身只负介绍责任，而农民运来的物品中的质量既不统一，而且又零星，几丈布、几斤花、几十斤草，还有一些冷门的消费品，如几斤蜂蜜、几斤药材……以及不可预计的零星物品，这些如一一介绍出去，确有很多的困难。如果服务所本身收了，因为有些东西不见得能很快的销出去，这笔资金的积压和东西的出路就无法处理；假如这些零星东西不帮助农民推销，那就没有解决农民的这些困难。尤其持零星东西者大都是生活较苦又是自己拿来的老实农民。处在这样情况下，该所在这一段试办工作中，是由服务所收进了，好在东西还不算太多；为了应付将来更多的这类情形，不但要联络各工厂、商店，又须要把联络伸长到直接消费者和远道来的客商。现在已有些机关伙食上自动向该所订购山药，大车店订购谷草的情形，这样不但减去了中间手续，又为了买卖双方直接谋到方便，可谓真正达到服务的目的。但如直接与消费者普遍发生关系，又会应接不暇，所以更进一步与现有各合作社取得密切联系，尤为重要，以便服务所尽可能不经营业务。
    这些天被照顾的农民，百分之九十以上是附近各县的，他们除了要求该所售予煤炭外，最大的要求是解决他们的食宿问题，附近的和更为广大的农民在进城后的买卖上依然求诸市场。就是到达该所的农民自动要求帮助他们买卖的还不够多。对这一问题的解决，该所将在扩大地址后，试设一农民各种需要物品和农民要求寄卖的东西的货样展览室，这些货样是各企业单位和农民请求代销的，并标出价格，使农民在一室中找到他所需的各种东西，城里人要买农产品或农副业生产品也可以到该室去找。选定货样后再事介绍成交。
    该所的经费问题，原则上是自供自足，它的来源是在各公营企业以最低价格供应的物品中略加利润，转售农民。如目前正太煤铁店照成本供给该所的煤炭，该所加上利润，仍低于市价百分之十，以这里的盈余来补充住宿的免费和吃饭的不赚钱以及其他业务开支。预计将来尚能维持。
　　工作方法的改进
    走进该所的农民一天比一天多了。他们携带的物品，有下至葱韭芥蒜，有五谷杂粮，以及各式各样的农业副产品和农村副业生产品，还有是转运的工业品和消费品；农民到城里要办的事除了购买可以预计的工业品和消费品外，小到几个铁钉和到药房配个单方。他们不惯于开发单打收条之类的手续，往该所存货，往往是放下就走，取时自己去拿。所以在工作中，必须注意不要订定许多繁杂的手续，而另方面，又注意耐心的来说服农民，使其愿意接受一些必要的手续。
    近来十几个工作人员招呼每天来往不到百人的场面，已经是从天不亮开始送老乡上路，一直到夜晚十二时都还不能休息。他们忘记了疲劳，没有丝毫怨言，可是这究竟不是办法。这里存在一个严重问题，是科学地分工和工作人员本身对于城市各种事物的熟悉。本来这样复杂和琐碎的工作，易处于被动，而工作人员对市场情形和各种货物的知识既缺乏，又没有科学地分工，那就显得更为被动和忙乱。目前该所正在研究详细分工和加紧业务学习，提高工作效率，不然这就会成为业务进展中一个最大的障碍。
    由于农民过去在城里吃亏的经验很多，对买卖上总是问东问西怕上当，尤其对于“秤头”上最为担心，因此，初次到服务所的农民很是担心，时常校验该所的秤，当农民第二次和第三次到服务所时，常听到他们说：“你们这里的秤很对。”可见他回去时也都校验过。所以负责任、守信用、多为农民打算是这一工作推进中的先决条件。
    来往中的农民大多数是老解放区的，民主生活过得久了，一般都有相当的政治水平，在该所宣传工作上，提到办农民服务所是共产党的政策，是政府叫办的，并说明服务所的任务和意图，他们听来最表欢迎也最相信。所以在服务所工作人员的服装上，当初有人提议一律穿便衣，以便接近农民；可是这些天的事实证明，农民对于几个穿便衣的工作同志反没有对接近穿制服的同志来得自然和亲切。相反的他们对于城市人的装束还有些看不惯，虽然这只是单凭形式上着眼的地方，开办之初也是应该注意的。
    根据以上情形，就感到在这里工作同志的政治水平很要紧，这里的工作者既要能和农民接近，又能了解他们的困难，还是替他们打算。与此并重的还要熟悉城市一切事物，不然服务就不能周到。目前该所干部在这一点上都正在努力学习。
