Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan Front, 20th—Since last December to the end of March this year, over the course of four months, 11,179 of Yan Xishan's bandit troops besieged in Taiyuan have surrendered to the Liberation Army or fled. The number of surrenders and desertions in March doubled compared to December of last year. The number of collective surrenders and desertions is increasing daily. On March 24th, seventeen members of the special service platoon of the enemy's 9th Brigade killed their special service instructor and collectively surrendered to the Liberation Army. Forty-five men from the 2nd company of the 1st regiment of the "Personally Trained Division," which Yan Xishan regarded as his confidants, also collectively surrendered on the evening of the 20th, led by their company commander.
