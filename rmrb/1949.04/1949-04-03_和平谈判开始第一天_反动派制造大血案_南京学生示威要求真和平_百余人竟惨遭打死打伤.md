　　Peace Talks Begin on First Day
  　Reactionaries Commit a Bloody Massacre
    Nanjing Students Demonstrate Demanding Genuine Peace; Over a Hundred People Tragically Killed and Wounded
    [North Beiping Xinhua Broadcasting Station, Second Broadcast] According to various reports: As the Nanjing reactionary government sent peace talk representatives to Beiping to conduct peace negotiations, a bloody massacre occurred in Nanjing in which over a hundred students demanding genuine peace were killed and wounded. On the morning of April 1st, over six thousand students from eleven colleges and universities including Central University and Jinling University held a demonstration, opposing the Kuomintang reactionary government’s continued pursuit of a counter-revolutionary war policy under the guise of conspiracy, and demanding the immediate acceptance of Chairman Mao’s eight peace terms to achieve genuine peace. Four student representatives handed over a written request to Weng Wenhao, the secretary-general of the pseudo-presidential palace, at the gate of the pseudo-presidential palace, but Weng Wenhao refused to give a specific reply. The students left the pseudo-presidential palace and started street propaganda. At 2:30 PM, when the student propaganda team arrived near Guanghua Gate, Kuomintang troops and secret agents who had been lying in ambush rushed out and brutally beat the students. According to the pseudo-Central News Agency, six students were seriously injured and sixty-six were slightly injured at that time. The students gathered again to petition the pseudo-presidential palace, but the bandit troops and secret agents still clung on and chased after them to commit violence, resulting in five more students being seriously injured and twenty-two slightly injured. According to Agence France-Presse, two students were sacrificed, eleven were seriously injured, and over a hundred were slightly injured. According to a United Press report, one hundred students are missing. The Nanjing reactionary government's massacre of students demanding genuine peace on the first day of the peace talks shows what the Kuomintang reactionary government's so-called peace is all about.

　　和平谈判开始第一天
  　反动派制造大血案
    南京学生示威要求真和平　百余人竟惨遭打死打伤
    【北平新华广播电台二日广播】据各方报导：当南京反动政府派和谈代表到北平进行和平谈判的时候，在南京演出打死打伤要求真和平的学生一百多名的大血案。四月一日上午，南京中央、金陵等十一个专科以上学校学生六千多人，举行游行示威，反对国民党反动政府在伪装的阴谋下，继续推行反革命战争的政策，要求立即接受毛主席八项和平条件实现真和平。学生代表四人，在伪总统府门口，把书面要求交给伪总统府秘书长翁文灏，但是翁文灏拒绝具体答复。学生离开伪总统府展开街头宣传。二时半，学生宣传队到光华门附近时，预先埋伏的国民党军队和特务冲出来凶殴学生，据伪中央社所承认的当时有学生六人重伤，六十六人轻伤，学生们又集合起来到伪总统府请愿，匪军和特务仍紧紧不放，追赶行凶，学生又五人重伤，二十二人轻伤。据法新社报导有学生二人牺牲，十一人重伤，一百多人轻伤。另据合众社讯：有学生一百人失踪。南京反动政府在和平谈判开始第一天，对要求真和平学生的屠杀，说明国民党反动政府所谓和平是怎么一回事。
