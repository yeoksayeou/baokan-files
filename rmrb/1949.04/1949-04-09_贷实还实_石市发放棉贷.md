　　Lending Real, Repaying Real
  　Shijiazhuang Issues Cotton Loans
    [Shijiazhuang News] The Shijiazhuang Branch of the People's Bank of China has allocated 5.3 million yuan in cotton planting loans to the Shijiazhuang Supply and Marketing Cooperative Federation, which will use the funds to purchase cotton seeds, fertilizers, and other supplies to loan to farmers in the city's suburbs. It is stipulated that the loan will be repaid in kind, such as lending soybeans and recovering ginned cotton or seed cotton. The loan term is set at eight months, with a monthly interest rate of 0.5%. Based on the market price on the Shijiazhuang Daily of March 24th, borrowing 100 jin of soybeans requires repayment of 28 jin, 7 liang, and 8 qian of seed cotton. This approach can solve farmers' difficulties, allow the bank to receive tangible goods, and partially address sales issues, reducing exploitation and manipulation by merchants. According to feedback from various districts, farmers highly welcome this method. The Shijiazhuang Trading Company has also decided to provide 330,000 jin of soybeans to the Supply and Marketing Cooperative Federation to order 500,000 jin of ginned cotton. Currently, a total of 480,000 jin of cake fertilizer and 450,000 jin of soybeans, totaling 930,000 jin of fertilizer and 100,000 jin of cotton seeds, have been distributed to the four suburban districts. The supply and marketing cooperatives in each district are currently discussing distribution in conjunction with the government and production committees. When cooperative members receive loans, an additional three jin are added per hundred jin. These three jin do not accrue interest and are not repaid, as this is equivalent to the benefit cooperative members would receive when purchasing fertilizer from the cooperative with cash.

　　贷实还实
  　石市发放棉贷
    【石家庄讯】中国人民银行石家庄分行，拨付石家庄供销合作总社种棉贷款五百三十万元，由合作总社购买棉籽、肥料等贷发市郊农民。并规定贷实还实办法，如贷出黑豆收回皮棉或籽棉。贷款期限定为八个月。月息五厘。按三月二十四日石家庄日报上行情价格折合，借一百斤黑豆，还二十八斤七两八钱籽棉。这样既可解决农民困难，银行方面也可收到实物，同时也可部份解决销路问题，减去商人从中的剥削操纵。根据各区反映，农民很欢迎这种办法。石市贸易公司也决定以三十三万斤黑豆交与供销合作总社，定购皮棉五十万斤。现共计已有四十八万斤饼类肥料、四十五万斤黑豆，共合肥料九十三万斤，棉籽十万斤，分与市郊四个区。现各区供销社正结合政府、生产委员会讨论发放。供销社社员贷款时，每百斤增加三斤，这三斤不收利息，也不归还，因为这正等于社员贷到现款在合作社购买肥料时应得的利益。
