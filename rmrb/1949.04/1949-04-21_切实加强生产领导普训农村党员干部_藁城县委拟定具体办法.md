To effectively strengthen production leadership and overcome spontaneous tendencies, the Gaocheng County Party Committee in the Hebei-Chahar-Hebei Border Region issued a specific plan on April 8th for universally training Party member cadres throughout the county. The training period is scheduled for April and May, with the aim of further enhancing Party member cadres' understanding of production policies and how to lead production, so as to give play to the leading role of Party branches in rural production. Attention will also be paid to discovering and cultivating key personnel in preparation for promoting cadres. The method of intensive training is based on small districts, with the time allocated from Qingming to Guyu, Guyu to Lixia, and Lixia to Xiaoman. Each solar term will have two training sessions (one at the beginning and one in the middle of each term). For villages with many problems, disunity, or poor work performance, the time will be appropriately increased to specifically resolve issues such as disunity and factionalism, so as to ensure the Party's leadership over the production movement.

Training content: Initially, thorough ideological mobilization will be conducted to alleviate their concerns about production. Secondly, using the "Production Propaganda Handbook" compiled and printed by the Hebei-Chahar-Hebei Border Region Party Committee, the resolutions on carrying out this year's production from the Regional Party Committee's Party Representative Conference held in February, the Xinhua News Agency's editorial on "Taking Agricultural Production a Step Forward," and the agricultural tax regulations promulgated by the North China People's Government as materials, combined with the local specific circumstances, study how to organize labor and how the Party branch can lead production. During the study, pay attention to organizing discussions using branches with better production leadership as typical examples, and also combine this with reviewing some past lessons in leading production. At the same time, based on the changing seasons, assign specific tasks that each branch should do upon returning.

In terms of leadership, the County Party Committee pointed out that it should be under the control of the District Party Committee. At the same time, in order not to affect production, it should be carried out in the afternoon. The method is collective explanation. For each lecture, half of the Party member cadres from each village can be selected to participate. After returning to the village, they will serve as the backbone to organize other Party member cadres for discussion. The next time, the other half will be organized to attend the lecture, and so on.

The plan concludes by pointing out that the leading ideology must recognize that this is a powerful method for promoting work through universal training, and it is centered around production. It must not be unilaterally considered to conflict with production and thereby relax the implementation of this plan. The districts are now actively carrying out the plan according to the County Party Committee's plan.

(Editor's note: The Gaocheng County Party Committee's method of training Party member cadres in phases is one of the effective ways to overcome spontaneous production tendencies from a positive perspective. However, the article does not mention how the County Party Committee leads this work, and whether this approach affects the busy farming season is indeed worth considering. Therefore, it is hoped that the Gaocheng County Party Committee will continue to organize reports on the training situation and experience.)

　　切实加强生产领导普训农村党员干部
  　藁城县委拟定具体办法
    【本报讯】为切实加强生产领导，克服自流现象，冀中区藁城县委于四月八日发布全县普训党员干部的具体计划。训练时间决定为四、五两个月份，其目的是使党员干部在生产政策与如何领导生产上提高一步，以发挥支部对农村生产的领导作用。并注意发现与培养骨干，准备提拔干部。集训的办法是以小区为单位，时间分配是清明至谷雨、谷雨到立夏、立夏到小满。每个节令训练两次（节初节中各一次），对问题多、不团结、工作不好的村，酌量增加时间，以便具体解决不团结、闹宗派等问题，以保证党对生产运动的领导。训练内容：开始时，先进行深入的思想动员，解除其对生产的顾虑。其次，以冀中区党委编印之生产宣传手册及区党委二月召开的全区党代表会议中关于开展今年生产的决议、新华社将农业生产提高一步的社论、华北人民政府颁布之农业税则为材料，结合本地具体情况研究如何组织劳动力与支部怎样领导生产等。学习中注意掌握以领导生产较好的支部为典型组织讨论，并可结合检讨一些过去领导生产的教训，同时根据季节的转变向各支部布置回去应做的具体工作。在领导上，县委指出，应由区委掌握，同时为了不影响生产，利用下午进行，方式是集体讲解，每次讲课，可抽各村半数的党员干部参加，回村后以他们做骨干，组织其他党员干部进行讨论。下一次则组织另一半来听课，以此类推。计划最后指出：领导思想必须认清这是通过普训推动工作的一种有力方法，是围绕着生产来做的，绝不应片面的借故认为与生产抵触，便放松对这一计划的执行。现各区正根据县委计划积极进行中。
    （编者按：藁城县委分期训练党员干部的办法，是从积极方面克服生产自流的办法之一，但文中未提到县委如何领导这一工作，同时这种作法是否影响农忙，也确实值得考虑。因此希望藁城县委继续组织关于训练情况及经验的报导。）
