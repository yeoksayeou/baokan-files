　　Correct the Reliance on Small Businessmen, Resolutely Rely on the Proletariat
  　Changxindian Reviews Political Construction Work
    [Our Newspaper] The Changxindian District Committee has reviewed its work on establishing political power, recognizing its neglect of relying on workers and the resulting error of depending on small businessmen. Changxindian is one of the important industrial areas in North China. The residents total more than 22,000, of which railway workers and railway machinery factory workers and their families account for about 60% of the total population, while merchants, peddlers, farmers, small handicraftsmen, and other personnel account for about 40%. However, according to the current 52 street government cadres in the 2nd, 3rd, 5th, 6th, 7th, and 8th streets, small vendors and merchants account for more than half, while workers (including handicraft workers and porters) account for only a little more than one-third, and there is not a single working industrial worker. As a result, many problems have arisen in the work. For example, the head of the 6th Street (a hooligan small businessman) even beat and scolded the loading and unloading worker Wang Zhendong when mediating disputes. Shang Zi'an, a melting craftsman at the machinery factory's foundry, said: "If industrial workers also participate in the street government and everyone works together, there will be fewer opinions." Recently, the District Committee made a special review, believing that the primary reason was the lack of a clear understanding of the idea of relying on the working class to build the city. In the past, it was thought that "working industrial workers do not have time to participate in politics." In fact, the poor people (including small merchants) were relied upon, while neglecting the absorption of industrial workers into the government. Secondly, the connection with enterprise trade unions was not close, and the situation of workers was not understood, which increased the difficulties. After the District Committee made a review, it has also set out methods for correction. (Xing Jun)

　　纠正依靠小商人坚决依靠无产阶级
  　长辛店检讨建政工作
    【本报讯】长辛店区委，检讨在建立政权上，忽视依靠工人，形成依赖小商人的错误。长辛店为华北重要工业区之一。居民共两万两千余，其中铁路职工、铁路机厂职工连家属约占总人口的百分之六十，商人、小贩、农民、小手工业者及其他人员约占百分之四十。但根据现有二、三、五、六、七、八街五十二个街政权干部中，其中小商贩和商人占半数以上，工人（包括手工业工人、脚夫在内）只占三分之一强，而没有一个在职的产业工人。这样工作上便发生了不少毛病，如六街街长（流氓小商人）在调解纠纷时，竟打骂装卸工人王振东，机厂铸工场熔化匠尚子安说：“如果产业工人也参加街政府，大家伙办，意见就少了”。最近区委特作了检讨：认为首先是由于依靠工人阶级建设城市的思想不明确，过去以为“在职产业工人没时间参政”，事实上是依靠了贫民（包括小商）。而忽视了吸收产业工人参加政权。其次与企业工会的联系不密切，不了解工人情况，增加了困难。区委作检讨后，并已定出纠正的办法。　　　　　　（邢军）
