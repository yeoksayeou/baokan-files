Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 28th. Inspired by the great victories, the production efficiency and finished product quality of various public enterprises and factories in Xuzhou City generally achieved significant improvements in March. The driving speed of the Longhai and Jinpu Railways increased from 25 to 30 kilometers per hour in February to 40 to 45 kilometers per hour in March. The Jinpu Railway also added a night train. The automobile assembly plant repaired 61 cars and 30 Dodge engines, doubling its work efficiency compared to February. The power plant's power generation increased by half compared to 400,000 kilowatt-hours in February. The match factory's production efficiency increased by one-third to one-half, while the number of personnel decreased by more than one-third. In addition to improving work efficiency and increasing production, workers in various enterprises actively conserved raw materials, utilized waste, and overcame difficulties. Thanks to the conscientious efforts of repair workers, drivers, and stokers, the coal consumption of the Longhai Railway was greatly reduced. In the Kuomintang's rule, the coal consumption from Xuzhou to Shangqiu was as high as 11.5 tons, while now it is only 6 to 7 tons. Workers of the Jinpu Railway used nearly three tons of scrap iron to make splints and screws for road repairs. The automobile assembly plant utilized more than fifteen or six types of waste materials, totaling more than 340 pieces, in half a month. By utilizing residual cigarette butts and waste cigarette paper, the cigarette factory produced an additional 29 cases of cigarettes per month. In the first half of March, the automobile assembly plant achieved seven creative improvements in its work. Jinpu Railway welder Wang Linghai and four others replaced calcium carbide with bituminous coal, solving the difficulty of the shortage of calcium carbide, an important raw material in metal welding, and reducing costs by at least 1.2 billion North Sea Currency. The reasons for the above achievements, in addition to the great victories of the Liberation War inspiring the workers' enthusiasm for supporting the front, are mainly that the leading organs gradually clearly recognized that relying on the working class should be the first priority in urban work, thus strengthening the education and organization of workers, and that various enterprises implemented a wage system based on physical objects, guaranteeing the actual living standards of workers, and initially establishing various workers' welfare undertakings. At present, the production and management work of various enterprises still has the following problems that have not been properly resolved: First, there is a state of no planning, and enterprise managers have not yet learned to organize production and cost accounting; second, there is a lack of organic coordination in production and sales, and the steps of various public enterprises are not consistent; third, some administrative cadres do not understand technology and do not learn technology, and do not pay attention to studying and absorbing past management experience. The production management system is not perfect, and there is a lack of precise finished product inspection system, resulting in some factories having a tendency to emphasize quantity over quality; fourth, on the issue of wages, due to the universal implementation of the erroneous policy of simply raising the lower levels and aligning with both ends during the takeover period, some workers do not value learning technology, and there is a phenomenon of lax labor discipline, which also affects the production enthusiasm and technical improvement of some staff and technicians. The above phenomena are being studied and corrected in various factories.

### 在伟大胜利的鼓舞下　徐州公营企业工厂三月生产普遍提高

　　在伟大胜利的鼓舞下
  　徐州公营企业工厂三月生产普遍提高
    【新华社济南二十八日电】徐州市各公营企业、工厂三月份的生产、工作效率与成品质量普遍获得显著提高。陇海、津浦两铁路之行车速度，二月份每小时为二十五至三十公里，三月份则增至四十到四十五公里。津浦路并增加了一班夜车。汽车装配厂修汽车六十一辆，大道奇引擎三十部，工作效率比二月份提高了一倍。水电厂的发电量比二月份的四十万度增加一半。火柴厂生产效率提高了三分之一到二分之一，而人员反减少三分之一以上。各企业工人除提高工作效率及增产以外，并且积极地节约原料，利用废物，克服困难。陇海铁路由于修理工人与司机、司炉认真负责，机煤耗费量大大减少。由徐州至商邱在国民党统治时期用煤多时达十一吨半，而现在则只用六、七吨。津浦路工人利用近三吨的废铁，打成夹板、螺丝供给修路之用。汽车装配厂于半月内，利用废料即达十五、六种，三百四十余件。烟厂由于利用残烟头与废烟纸，每月多产二十九箱香烟。汽车装配厂在三月份上半月内，带有创造性的改进工作即达七种。津浦路电焊工人汪岭海等五人以烟煤代替电石，解决了焊接金属中的重要原料电石缺乏的困难，减少成本至少在十二亿元北海币。获得上述成绩的原因除解放战争的伟大胜利鼓舞了工人支援前线的积极性以外，主要的是领导机关逐渐明确认识了城市工作中首先要依靠工人阶级，因而加强了对工人的教育与组织。以及各企业单位实行了按实物折价的工资制度，保障了工人的实际生活水平，并初步兴办了各种工人福利事业。目前各企业单位的生产、管理工作中，仍有如下问题未得妥善解决：一、存在着无计划状态，企业管理人员还没有学会组织生产与成本计算；二、生产运销方面缺乏有机的配合，各公营企业单位步调不够一致；三、有些行玫干部不懂技术而又不学技术，不注意研究吸收过去的管理经验。生产管理制度不够完备，缺乏精确的成品检查制度，以致部分工厂发生重量不重质的偏向；四、在工资问题上，由于在接管时期普遍实行单纯上压下抬、两头靠拢的错误政策，因此造成部分工人不重视学习技术的恶果与劳动纪律松懈的现象，同时也影响了一部职员、技师的生产积极性与技术提高的进取心。以上现象各厂正在研究纠正中。
