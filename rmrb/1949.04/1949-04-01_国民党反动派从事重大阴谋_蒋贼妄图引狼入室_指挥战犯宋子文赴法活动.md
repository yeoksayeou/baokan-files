Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 30th: War criminal Song Ziwen is currently engaging in major conspiratorial activities under the direction of war criminal ringleader Chiang Kai-shek. According to the Associated Press, Song Ziwen arrived in Guangzhou from Hong Kong on the 25th of this month and held consultations with Sun Ke, Xue Yue, and others. The content of these discussions concerned so-called "national issues" such as "establishing an army in Guangdong" and "establishing a government of last resistance." Following this, he rushed to Xikou for a 24-hour meeting with the traitor Chiang, and then returned to Hong Kong on the 28th. At this point, news spread that Song Ziwen would soon depart for France. According to the Hong Kong Standard, Song Ziwen's trip to France "has two purposes: to participate in discussions on the Pacific Pact and to purchase arms for the 'Chinese government'." The newspaper also stated that the Kuomintang is eager to conclude a Pacific Pact, and that "the arms deal, which is scheduled to be finalized by Song Ziwen, was initiated with the Hong Kong branch of a well-known European company." On the one hand, representatives of the Kuomintang reactionary government are scheduled to come to Beiping within a day or two to conduct peace negotiations with the Chinese Communist Party; on the other hand, the Kuomintang reactionaries are still purchasing arms, conscripting soldiers and grain, consolidating their military strength, and colluding with imperialist aggressive blocs to engage in international adventurism, attempting to invite wolves into the house and stage a comeback. The conspiracies of the Kuomintang reactionaries deserve serious attention.

    国民党反动派从事重大阴谋
    蒋贼妄图引狼入室
    指挥战犯宋子文赴法活动
    【新华社北平三十日电】战犯宋子文正在战犯头子蒋介石的指挥下从事重大的阴谋活动。据美联社透露，宋子文于本月二十五日由香港到了广州，与孙科、薛岳等进行会商，内容是讨论“在广东建立一支军队”以及“建立最后抵抗的政府”的所谓“全国性问题”。接着，他就赶往溪口，与蒋贼会商二十四小时，而于二十八日返回香港。这时，便传出消息，说宋子文很快将启程赴法。据香港标准报称：宋子文去法，“含有两个目的——参加太平洋公约的讨论及为‘中国政府’购买军火”。该报又说：国民党渴望订立太平洋公约，而“预定将由宋子文最后完成的这笔军火交易，是与一著名欧洲公司的香港分社开始进行的”。一方面国民党反动政府的代表一二天内就要来北平与中国共产党进行和平谈判；另方面国民党反动派仍在购买军火，征兵征粮，整军经武，并且勾结帝国主义侵略集团进行国际冒险，妄图引狼入室，卷土重来。国民党反动派的阴谋，实堪注意。
