　　Why Charge Fellow Villagers More for Postage?
　　To the Editor:
　　There has been a case of embezzlement by personnel at the Fuping Seventh District Post Office (located in Chengnanzhuang). Once, farmers Yang Zhixiang and Li Fengen went to send regular letters. A comrade at the post office said, "Regular letters are not guaranteed to arrive, send them by registered mail instead!" and charged 36 yuan per letter. According to regulations, registered mail should cost 24 yuan. When asked why it was so expensive, the comrade at the post office said, "It's the regulation from above!" As a result, they sent two letters at 36 yuan each. Later, Li Fengen's daughter found out about this and went to ask the post office. The comrade at the post office said, "I misspoke last time, don't pay so much in the future." But they did not refund the money to the villagers. I hope the leadership will investigate and appropriately handle this matter, and that the comrade in question will conduct a thorough self-criticism.

　　为什么多跟老乡要邮费
    编辑同志：
    阜平七区邮局（住城南庄）人员有贪污事件发生。有一次，农民杨志祥、李凤恩去发平信，邮局里一个同志说：“平信收不到，发双挂号吧！”并每封信要人民币三十六元，按照规定双挂号是二十四元。问邮局为什么这样贵？那个同志说：“上级规定的！”结果就按三十六元发了两封信。后来李凤恩的女儿知道了，跑去问邮局，邮局同志说：“上次说错了，以后就不要那么多了。”也没把钱退给老乡。我希望领导上对这事检查和适当处理一下，这个同志本人并应深刻检讨一番。
