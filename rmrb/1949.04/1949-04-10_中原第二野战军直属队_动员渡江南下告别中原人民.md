Xinhua News Agency, Central Plains, 9th. The Second Field Army Direct Unit held a mobilization rally for the southward crossing of the Yangtze River and issued a letter bidding farewell to the people of the Central Plains and all party, government, military, and civilian workers. The full text is as follows:

　　To all working people in the Central Plains Liberated Area and all comrades in the party, government, military, and civilian sectors: With your active support, the liberation war in the Central Plains region has achieved unprecedented and enormous victories. For the past year and a half, in order to eliminate the Kuomintang bandit troops, you have tightened your belts, endured hardships, worked day and night, supported the front lines, and continuously contributed large amounts of manpower, materials, and financial resources. Thousands upon thousands of your dearest sons and husbands have joined and strengthened the ranks of the people's army. Your contributions are so great! Your actions are so glorious! Without your support, the victory of the Central Plains Liberation War would have been impossible. We deeply realize that the people are the source of victory, and victory belongs to the people forever! Today, as we hold this mobilization rally for the southward advance, we are very grateful for your various assistance and consolations. For the past year and a half, we have not only established close ties of flesh and blood with the people of the Central Plains, but also developed sincere feelings between us. However, now we must temporarily part with you. In order to save our suffering compatriots in the south of the Yangtze River and liberate all of China, we must resolutely advance into the south of the Yangtze River, realize the eight peace conditions, and carry the revolution through to the end! We clearly know that although the Kuomintang reactionary troops have been defeated by the people and the people's army, the die-hard followers of Chiang Kai-shek have not been completely eliminated. They are playing tricks, trying to gain a respite, intensify their military deployment, and vainly attempt to make a comeback. Therefore, everyone must be extremely vigilant and not relax due to victory. We must better mobilize all forces and continue to actively support the large army crossing the Yangtze River southward. We must work even harder to build the Central Plains Liberated Area—the forward base for crossing the river. Only by eliminating the Kuomintang reactionary forces and liberating all of China can the people of the Central Plains truly live and work in peace and enjoy a free and happy life forever. Farewell! Fathers, elders, brothers, and sisters of the Central Plains: We will answer your care and expectations with new victories. We vow to, under the leadership and command of the CCP Central Committee, Chairman Mao, and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, and under the leadership and guidance of Chief Commanders Liu and Deng, cooperate with the friendly neighboring Liberation Army, victoriously advance into the south of the Yangtze River, and plant the glorious banner of the People's Liberation Army and the people's liberation all over the south of the Yangtze River.

　　Second Field Army Direct Unit Southward Mobilization Rally.

  　动员渡江南下告别中原人民
    【新华社中原九日电】第二野战军直属队南下动员大会发表告别中原人民暨党政军民全体工作人员书，全文如下：
    中原解放区全体劳动人民暨党政军民全体工作同志：在你们的积极支援下，中原地区解放战争赢得了空前巨大的胜利。一年半以来，为着消灭国民党匪军，你们节衣缩食，不辞劳苦，夜以继日，支援前线，源源不绝地贡献了大批的人力物力财力，千千万万你们最亲爱的儿子和丈夫参加和壮大了人民军队的行列，你们的功劳多么伟大！你们的行动多么光荣！没有你们的支援，中原解放战争的胜利是不可能的。我们深深地体会到：人民是胜利的源泉，胜利是永远属于人民的！今天我们在此举行南下动员大会，我们十分感谢你们的各种援助和慰问。一年半以来，我们不仅和中原人民建立了亲密的血肉联系，而且我们之间已产生了真挚的感情；然而现在我们不得不暂时与你们分别，为了拯救受苦受难的江南同胞，解放全中国，我们必须坚决进军江南，实现八项和平条件，将革命进行到底！我们清楚地知道：今天国民党反动军队虽然被人民和人民的军队打败了，但蒋介石死党没有最后死亡，他们正在玩弄阴谋，企图求得喘息时间，加紧军事布置，妄想卷土重来。因此大家要万分警惕，不要因胜利而松懈，要更好地动员一切力量，继续积极支援渡江南进大军。更加努力建设好渡江的前进基地——中原解放区。只有消灭了国民党反动势力，解放了全中国，中原人民才能真正的安居乐业，才能永远享受自由幸福的生活。暂别了！中原父老兄弟姐妹们：我们将以新的胜利来回答你们的关怀和期望。我们誓在中共中央、毛主席、朱总司令领导和指挥下，在刘邓首长率领和指导之下，和友邻解放军互相配合，胜利向江南进军，把人民解放军和人民解放的光辉大旗插遍江南。
