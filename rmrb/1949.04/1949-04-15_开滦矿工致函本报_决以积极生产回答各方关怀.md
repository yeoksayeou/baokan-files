Kailuan Miners Send Letter to This Newspaper
Resolving to Respond to All Concerns with Active Production

To all comrades of the People's Daily and the North China Branch:

　　Under your sincere concern and vigorous assistance, we have received the condolences and support from tens of thousands of workers in Tianjin, Beijing, and this city. This is something we will never forget when our struggle achieves initial victory. You are one of our closest and most understanding revolutionary comrades-in-arms. We respectfully wish you all success in your work and good health.

　　In the past few decades, our lives have never been guaranteed. Under the long-term cruel rule and exploitation of imperialist capitalists, the "death" and "injury" of miners have become commonplace. Dozens or even hundreds of workers in Tangshan Mine have died in a single disaster. That was incomparably more serious than this time, but who was willing to say a word for us? Which newspaper was willing to publish a single word for us? No one. Never. Our pain, our tears, we had to swallow quietly into our own stomachs. This time, with your full assistance, we have achieved victory. We have a deeper understanding that our own Party, our own news agency, and our own newspaper have an inseparable blood relationship with us. We only hope that under your education and encouragement, we can raise our awareness and strengthen our unity. We will use the restoration and development of production, actively studying revolutionary principles, and improving our cultural level as a tribute to you. With our highest respect!

### 开滦矿工致函本报　决以积极生产回答各方关怀

　　开滦矿工致函本报
  　决以积极生产回答各方关怀人民日报社、华北总分社全体同志
    在你们的热诚关怀鼎力相助之下，我们获得了平津及本市千万职工同志们的慰问与支援，这是当我们斗争获得初步胜利的时候所念念永不能忘却的。你们是我们的最亲切与最知己的革命战友之一。敬祝你们全体同志的工作胜利与身体健康。
    过去几十年来我们的生命从来是没有任何保障的，在帝国主义资本家长期残酷统治剥削下的矿工“死”和“伤”已成司空见惯，唐山矿曾经有过数十以致成百的工友在一次的灾难中死掉了，那比较这次要严重得不可比拟，但是又有谁肯替我们说一句话呢？又有那张报纸愿给我们登一个字呢？没有。从来没有的。我们的痛苦我们的泪水只好悄悄的咽到我们自己的肚里。这次在你们的全力协助下，我们得到胜利了，我们是更深刻的体会到我们自己的党、自己的通讯社、自己的报纸是和我们有着血肉不可分离的关系，我们仅希望今后能在你们的教育与鼓舞下提高我们的觉悟，加强我们的团结，我们要用恢复与发展生产，和积极学习革命道理，提高文化水平，来做为回答你们的敬意。此致最敬礼！
