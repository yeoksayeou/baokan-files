    [Our Newspaper] In order to unify the organization, leadership and development of the steel industry in North China, the Enterprise Department of the North China People's Government held the first North China Steel Conference at the North China Steel Company Workers' Club on the morning of the 20th. Attendees included representatives from: North China Steel Company, Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, Tianjin Steel Plant, Tangshan Steel Plant, Xuanhua Iron Plant, Guye Refractory Materials Plant, and other units. After the chairman explained the significance of the meeting, Minister Liu Ding of the Enterprise Department gave a report. Minister Liu first explained the important significance of this steel conference, and expressed his respect to the workers, staff, engineers, and technicians of each factory for their responsibility in protecting the factories from damage during the Liberation War, and for their active efforts in organizing and resuming production after liberation. He then proposed that the future tasks of the North China Steel Company are to restore and develop the steel industry, improve finished products, reduce costs, and strive for the maximum amount of production. Finally, he expressed his hope to everyone: that the North China Steel Company should be realistic and complete the plan on schedule. All employees should abandon all concerns, have confidence, and work steadfastly. Engineers, technicians, and experts should unite with the workers, rely on the workers, and care for the workers; engineers and engineers should also be closely united and help each other. In the future, they should provide more suggestions and criticisms to the Enterprise Department. Subsequently, Deputy Minister Xu of the Enterprise Department, as well as representatives from various units, spoke one after another. Zhu Dedi, a worker representative from the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant, said: "The production enthusiasm of our factory's employees is high, and the workers are actively demanding full resumption of production. Today, Minister Liu has given Shijingshan the task of restoring and developing production, which will surely be supported by all employees." In the afternoon, after the conference listened to reports on the current work situation of each unit, it moved into group discussions based on the principles proposed by Minister Liu to formulate production plans.
