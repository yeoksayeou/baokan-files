From the Tianjin Municipal Party Committee Organs Saving Electricity

In order to increase the industrial electricity supply and eliminate waste, the Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China has drastically reduced the number of light bulbs and electricity consumption, saving 32 horsepower of electricity. This good measure is worth emulating by party, government, military, and civilian organs and organizations in various cities. This spirit of thrift should be promoted in all aspects. Whether it is food, clothing, housing, or transportation, we must adhere to the long-term hard work style of the past, practice comprehensive conservation, and resolutely eliminate all kinds of waste.

The vast majority of our organs and cadres have maintained the traditional hard-working style after entering the cities. We have given the urban people a simple and good impression, and in some aspects, we have played a role in changing customs, which is good. After entering the cities, it is entirely necessary for us to adapt to urban life and make full use of the various convenient conditions in the cities. However, some comrades have not used the better material conditions of the city to make their lives or work more scientific and rational, but have become extravagant. For example, they can use electricity casually, but forget that electricity is the people's blood and sweat and the driving force of industrial production. One person uses three or four lights, which are brightly lit all night; they can also use water, gasoline, and furniture casually... without cherishing or saving them, as if these things are inexhaustible. These bad phenomena are the bad influences left over from the old society. Although they are individual and minority phenomena, they should sound the alarm to arouse vigilance. It is hoped that all localities will consciously conduct inspections, carry out criticism and self-criticism, and carry out education and persuasion work, so that everyone understands that if a place or a person wastes a little, the total will be a shocking loss; on the contrary, if a place or a person saves a little, then the collection will become the greatest force in building the city. We must resolutely follow the spirit of the Second Plenary Session of the Party's Seventh Central Committee that "we must ensure that comrades continue to maintain the style of hard struggle," and be earnestly thrifty in every thread and strand.

### 从天津市委机关节省电力谈起

　　从天津市委机关节省电力谈起
    中共天津市委为增加工业用电，杜绝浪费，大量减少了灯头和电度，节省下三十二匹马力的电力，这一良好措施值得各城市党政军民机关团体效法，这种节约精神值得推广到各个方面去，无论是衣食住行，都须本着以往长期艰苦奋斗的作风，厉行全面节约，坚决消除各种浪费现象。
    我们绝大多数机关和干部在进入城市后，是保持了传统的艰苦作风的，我们给予城市人民以一个朴素的好印象，在某些方面已起了移风易俗的作用，这是好的。在进入城市后，我们适应城市生活，充分运用城市各种便利条件也是完全必要的。但有的同志并没有利用城市较好的物质条件来使自己生活或工作更加科学化合理化，反而铺张奢侈起来，譬如：他可以随便用电，却忘记了电是人民的血汗，是工业生产的动力，一个人用三个灯四个灯，澈夜通明；也可以随便用水，用汽油，用家具……而毫不爱惜节省，似乎这些东西是取之无尽的。这些坏现象是旧社会遗留的恶劣影响，虽是个别的少数的现象，亦应敲响警钟，以引起警惕。希望各地有意识地进行检查，并开展批评与自我批评，进行教育说服工作，使大家懂得：一个地方一个人浪费一点，全部算起来，便是惊人损失；相反的，一个地方一个人节约了一点，那么汇集起来便成了建设城市最很大力量。我们必须坚决按照党的二中全会“务必使同志们继续地保持艰苦奋斗的作风”的精神，一丝一缕，都认真俭省。
