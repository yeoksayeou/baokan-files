　　Soldiers, Workers, Professors, Students, Citizens
　　Unanimously Support the Advance Order
　　[Our Special Dispatch] Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu's order to advance, issued to the Chinese People's Liberation Army on April 21st, has been met with cheers and support from the broad masses of the people. The commanders and fighters of the People's Liberation Army, workers, students, and working people in Beiping, where Chairman Mao is located, have shown particular excitement. They unanimously believe that since the Kuomintang reactionaries are unwilling to accept Chairman Mao's eight peace conditions and are unwilling to have genuine peace, Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu must issue this order to resolutely eliminate all Kuomintang reactionaries who dare to resist. The day of national victory is coming soon. We wholeheartedly support and assist the People's Liberation Army in its advance.
