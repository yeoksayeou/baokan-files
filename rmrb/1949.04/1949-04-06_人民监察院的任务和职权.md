To the Editor:

　　In the news item published in your newspaper on March 15th regarding the disciplinary actions taken against Gao Yuan贵, Deputy Director of the Jinnan Administrative Office, and Yuan Chongde袁崇德, Mayor of Handan, for violating discipline, it was mentioned that "the People's Supervisory Yuan has repeatedly investigated, and the facts have been clarified. The People's Supervisory Yuan, considering the case to involve violations of administrative discipline, submitted a report for deliberation." What exactly is the People's Supervisory Yuan? What are its tasks and powers? Please inform us.

　　Du Weiping　March 24th

　　Mr. Du Weiping:

　　Regarding the questions you raised, we have requested the North China Government People's Supervisory Yuan to respond as follows:

　　The North China People's Supervisory Yuan is one of the departments directly under the leadership of the North China People's Government. Its tasks and powers are clearly stipulated in Article 9 of the Organizational Outline of the North China People's Government: "Its tasks are to inspect, report, and decide on the punishment of administrative personnel, judicial personnel, and personnel of public enterprises at all levels for illegal acts, dereliction of duty, corruption, waste, and other behaviors that violate policies and harm the interests of the people, and to accept people's complaints against the aforementioned personnel. In order to exercise their powers, the personnel of the People's Supervisory Yuan may conduct investigations with relevant organs; the relevant organs must accept inspections and provide necessary materials. The decisions of the People's Supervisory Yuan regarding punishment shall be submitted to the court for trial if they require judicial adjudication; those that need to be implemented by administrative organs shall be submitted to the Chairman for approval and forwarded to the relevant administrative organs for processing." Therefore, if the people discover that public officials in administrative, judicial, or financial organs have committed illegal acts or dereliction of duty, they can report them to the People's Supervisory Yuan. At the same time, the People's Supervisory Yuan also regularly sends supervisory personnel to various localities and departments to inspect work and solicit the opinions of the people regarding government officials. The People's Supervisory Yuan, based on the materials of various cases reported by the people and its own investigations, puts forward opinions on punishment and submits them to the Chairman for approval and forwarding to the relevant departments for execution. As you mentioned, Deputy Director Gao and Mayor Yuan violated administrative discipline in handling housing property issues. The People's Supervisory Yuan investigated and proposed punishment, which was approved by the Chairman and implemented.

　　人民监察院的任务和职权编辑同志：
    贵报三月十五日登载冀南行署副主任高元贵、邯郸市长袁崇德违犯纪律受到处分消息内，有经人民监察院屡次调查，事实真象已明，人民监察院以案关违犯行政纪律，签呈议处等语，究竟人民监察院是做什么的机关？他的任务和职权是什么？请予告知。
    杜卫平　三月二十四日
    杜卫平先生：
    你所提的问题，我们已请华北政府人民监察院答复如下：
    华北人民监察院是华北人民政府直接领导的部门之一。其任务和职权，在华北人民政府组织大纲第九条有明文规定：“其任务为检查、检举并决议处分各级行政人员、司法人员、公营企业人员之违法失职、贪污浪费及其他违反政策、损害人民利益之行为，并接受人民对上述人员之控诉。人民监察院人员为行使职权，得向有关机关进行调查；各该有关机关，必须接受检查，提供必要之材料。人民监察院有关处分的决议，须交法院审判者，得提请法院审理之；须交各行政机关执行者，得提请主席批交各有关行政机关处理之。”所以人民如果发现行政、司法、财经各机关的公务人员有违法失职的行为，都可以向人民监察院举发，同时人民监察院也经常派有监察人员往各地、各部门去检查工作，并征求人民对政府机关人员的意见。人民监察院根据人民举发和自己调查的各种案件材料，提出处分意见，提请主席批交有关部门执行。如你所提的高副主任和袁市长，就是因为在处理房产问题中违犯了行政纪律，经人民监察院调查并拟议处分经主席批准执行的。
