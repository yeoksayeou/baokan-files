　　Su Heiyan Murders Child Bride: Yangquan Court Arrests and Tries Her
  　Shijiazhuang Women's Federation Demands Severe Punishment for the Culprit

    [Shijiazhuang News] Su Heiyan of Shibuizi Village, Second District, Yangquan City, beat her child bride to death. The city's People's Court has arrested her and is handling the case. Su Heiyan, nicknamed "Mother Scorpion," bought her child bride, Pang Ni, age fourteen, from a farmer's family in Shouyang Village. Pang Ni was subjected to all kinds of abuse. On February 5th of this year, Su Heiyan ordered Pang Ni to grind cornmeal, and insisted that she had ground too little. She threw Pang Ni from the bed to the ground and beat her severely with a wooden stick, causing two bloody holes in her head and at the base of her right ear, and covering her body in purple bruises. She also forced her to eat a pile of feces. On February 13th, Su Heiyan locked Pang Ni, who was thinly dressed, in an uninhabited cold cellar, covering her with a basket for the night. The next day, Pang Ni was vomiting yellow water and her tongue was stiff. She died on February 17th! Su Heiyan and her eldest son secretly buried Pang Ni's body. The Second District government of the village discovered this and reported it to the city's People's Court. The culprit has now been arrested and is being interrogated. Residents of the village are expressing outrage at Su Heiyan's audacity in harming human life in the democratic liberated area. Comrade Guo Tong, the person in charge of the Shijiazhuang Democratic Women's Federation, issued an indignant statement, saying: "This incident actually happened in the people's Yangquan City, which is simply lawless to the extreme! In order to protect women's rights and seek justice for the deceased, we demand that the Yangquan People's Court severely punish the culprit."

    [Another News] Ge Gaifeng, chairman of the Wangzaoling Women's Federation in the Lingchuan Duo Huo District, has consistently been active in leading women's struggles, production, and various tasks to support the front lines. Her husband, Zhang Guisuo, has always been indecent, having a corrupt relationship with his uncle's wife, and discriminating against her. Last summer, the village cadres, due to a lack of understanding of the Party rectification policy, were afraid of Party rectification and laid down on the job, and the village work was temporarily left unmanaged. Her husband took the opportunity to beat her. At that time, Ge Gaifeng had asked the Farmers' Association chairman to stand up for her, but the Farmers' Association chairman took an irresponsible attitude and left it aside. In early February of this year, Zhang Guisuo listened to others' instigation and severely beat Gaifeng one dark night, leaving her unable to get out of bed for five or six days.

    After investigating Zhang Guisuo's illegal behavior, the district office, in order to protect women's rights, not only made Zhang Guisuo reflect on his mistakes in the district, but also fined him to carry water for five days in the village cadre training class.

　　苏黑眼杀害童养媳　阳泉法院拘捕审理
  　石市妇联要求严惩凶犯
    【石家庄讯】阳泉市二区石卜咀村苏黑眼打死童养媳，经市人民法院拘捕，正予处理。苏黑眼外号“母蝎子”，她的童养媳胖妮年十四岁，买自寿阳村一农民家，平时就被百般虐待。今年二月五日，苏黑眼命胖妮推玉黍蜀面，硬说面给推少了，把胖妮从炕上摔到地下，并用木棍痛打，将头部和右耳根打了两个血洞，混身紫肿，还强迫吃了一堆大粪。二月十三日，苏黑眼又把衣服单薄的胖妮关在无人住的冷窖里，用篓子扣住冻了一夜，次日胖妮口吐黄水，舌根僵硬，延至二月十七日就死了！苏黑眼及其大儿子即将胖妮的尸体偷偷埋掉。住该村二区区政府发觉后，当转告该市人民法院，现已将该犯捕获，正审讯中。该村居民对苏黑眼竟敢在民主的解放区伤害人命一事，莫不表示愤慨。石家庄民主妇联负责人郭彤同志特愤激地发表谈话，略称：“这件事竟然发生在人民的阳泉市，简直无法无天到了极点！为了保障妇女人权，替死者申冤，要求阳泉人民法院严惩凶犯。”
    【又讯】陵川夺火区王早岭妇联会主席葛改凤，在领导妇女斗争、生产、支援前线各种工作中，一向积极。她的男人张贵锁，平日就不正派，与叔伯嫂有腐化关系，对她采取歧视态度。去年夏天，该村干部因对整党政策不了解，害怕整党而躺倒，村中工作暂时无人管理，她男人趁机打了她一顿。当时葛改凤曾找农会主席给她作主，但农会主席采取不负责任态度，放在一边没管。今年二月初，张贵锁又听上别人挑拨，某黑夜把改凤狠狠打了一顿，五六天不能起床。
    区署对张贵锁的非法行为调查清楚后，为了保障妇女权利，除让张贵锁在区上反省错误外，并罚他到村干训练班担水五天。
