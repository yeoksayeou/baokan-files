Work Quality Clearly Distinguished on the Same Day
Xuanhua Paper Mill Builds Broadcasting Station
[Chahar News] The workers of the Xuanhua Paper Mill established a broadcasting station to promote the production competition movement, which achieved good results. The broadcasting station was built in the highest place in the center of the factory. The broadcasting materials were reported by the leaders of each work group and collected by the communications group. After evening study, the communications group was responsible for broadcasting. It started on the 31st of last month. In the broadcast on that day, Ma Zhongmin was praised for his active work; Zhang Fengtong saw an unclaimed leather coat after get off work in the evening and automatically handed it over to the self-defense team for collection. The exemplary deeds of family members, women and children in tree planting were also praised. At the same time, Ding Baorui was criticized for not working seriously when repairing the machine room; and workers who were late for work were also criticized. After this broadcast, all the workers in the factory became active. Liu Lianggui said to her husband Jia Kunxiang: "This is so reasonable. Good and bad are distinguished on the same day. Not only the whole factory knows, but even Nanguan hears it. You have to work hard. It would be embarrassing to be broadcasted for not working hard!" The next day, Jia Kunxiang chopped fourteen pieces of two-inch-thick, one-meter-long and ninety-four-meter-wide iron plates in three hours. More than a dozen people in the iron workshop asked the foreman Liu Haishan to allocate a few more days of work so they could get it done quickly and be praised by the broadcasting station. After the work was assigned, Li Shunan made screws that were five-tenths of an inch thick and more than forty-eight meters long, and he made 150 of them in one day. Zhang Shusheng, a handyman, tied up the frames for six rooms in one day. The self-defense team also couldn't hold back. During their daytime shifts of sleeping, Liu Xiang and Huo Bingjin automatically went to the station to pull coal. Now the factory is launching a heated competition in striving for model status.

　　工作好坏当天分清
  　宣化纸厂建广播台
    【察哈尔讯】宣化造纸厂职工建立广播台，以推动生产竞赛运动，获得良好效果。广播台建立在厂子中心最高的地方，广播材料由各工作小组组长报告及通讯组搜集，晚上学习后，通讯组负责广播。上月三十一日开始实行。当日广播中，表扬马忠民工作积极；张凤桐在晚上下班后见到一件没主的皮大衣，自动交给自卫队招领。并表扬了家属妇女儿童们在植树中的模范事例等。同时也批评了丁宝瑞在修机器房时不认真工作；又批评了上班晚到的工人们。这一广播后，全厂职工都活跃起来了，刘良桂对她丈夫贾昆祥说：“这多合理呀，好坏当天就分出来了，不但全厂知道，连南关都听见了，你可要努力干活呀，不好好干活广播出来多难看呢！”贾昆祥第二天三个钟头就剁了十四块二英寸厚一米长九十四米多宽的铁板。铁工房的十几个人都要求领班的刘海山多分配几天的工作，快些干，让广播台表扬。工作分配后李树南打五分粗四十八米多长的螺丝，一天打了一百五十根。杂工张树生一天就绑了六间房的架子。自卫队也沉不住气了，在白天轮流睡觉的时间内，刘祥、霍丙金自动去车站拉煤。现该厂在争取模范中，展开了热烈的竞赛。
