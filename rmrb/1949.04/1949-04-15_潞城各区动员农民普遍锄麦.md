(Taihang News) The Lucheng County Committee, in order to ensure increased wheat production, has issued a call to all the people of the county to universally weed wheat. In the past, most of the masses did not have the habit of weeding wheat, and only a few had top-dressed and weeded wheat. This year, wheat fields account for 36 percent of the total land, which is of great importance to agricultural production increase. To this end, the County Committee dispatched cadres to Xicun, Wuli Hou and other villages on March 14 to study the issue of wheat weeding and top-dressing with cadres and the masses, to gain experience and promote it throughout the county. Some cadres and masses in the village were unwilling to weed wheat and apply top dressing. After understanding their ideological problems, they convened village cadres and experienced old farmers to study the favorable conditions for weeding wheat this year: there is a lot of rain, and the soil is wet and not afraid of drying out. It was decided to weed once universally, because there is a shortage of manure and it is not possible to apply top dressing to all of it. When the Fifth District convened a meeting of cadres and activists in key villages, they specifically discussed wheat weeding. Through the exchange of experience, all key village cadres increased their confidence. Zhao Taiji, chairman of the Nantianhe Farmers' Association, said: "Our village has experience in weeding wheat. Last year, I applied two buckets of top dressing and weeded once for one and a half mu of wheat, and I harvested two bags (equivalent to six city dou of stone). Only then did the masses in our village realize that wheat weeding does not kill the wheat." Practical experience has proved that weeding wheat and applying top dressing are beneficial. Many cadres said: "We will go back and take the lead." At the meeting of cadres in six key villages in the Fourth District, special discussions were held on top dressing and weeding wheat fields. It was recognized that if the wheat fields are not weeded once, the task of increasing production will not be completed. For example, Lian Jinqi from Changzhuang said: "Han Yousheng in our village planted eight mu of wheat last year, and weeded five mu. The wheat in the weeded land was full, and the yield of the unweeded land was poor." After everyone's thinking was clear, they made a plan to mobilize women to ensure that the wheat fields are weeded once.

　　潞城各区动员农民
  　普遍锄麦
    【太行讯】潞城县委会为了保证麦地增产，特号召全县群众普遍锄麦。往年在群众中大部没有锄麦习惯，只有少数上过追肥锄过麦。今年麦地占总土地的百分之三十六，对农业增产关系很大。为此县委会于三月十四日派出干部，到西村、五里后等村，和干部群众研究锄麦上追肥问题，取得经验以推动全县。在村干部群众中有一些人不愿锄麦和上追肥，了解了思想问题后，就召开村干部和种地有经验的老农，大家研究出今年锄麦的有利条件：雨水多，地皮湿不怕干死。决定普锄一遍，因为大粪缺，不能全部上追肥。五区在召开基点村干积极分子会时，特别讨论了锄麦。从交流经验中，全基点干部都提高了信心。南天河农会主席赵太记说：“我村锄麦有经验，我去年种的一亩半麦上了两桶追肥，又锄了一遍，就打了两布袋（合市斗石六）我村群众才认识了麦子锄不死。”从实际经验中，证明了锄麦上追肥有好处，许多干部说：咱回去先带头。四区六个基点村干部会议上，对麦地上追肥锄苗都作了专门讨论，认识了麦地如不锄一次，增产任务就完不成。如常庄连进其说：“我村韩有盛去年种八亩麦，锄了五亩，锄过的地麦子饱满，没锄的收成差。”大家思想通了后，订出计划，回去要发动妇女保证麦地锄一遍。
