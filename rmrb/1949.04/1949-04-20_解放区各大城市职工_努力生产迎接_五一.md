Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, April 18th: Workers in various state-owned enterprises and factories in Tianjin are striving for production to greet the first "May Day" Labor Day after liberation. Workers at the Machinery Factory of the Municipal Enterprise Corporation have voluntarily extended their working hours by one hour per day since April 7th. At the same time, they have issued challenge letters to other factories of the same type of enterprise corporation, proposing competitive conditions such as completing the April production plan ahead of schedule, improving quality, saving raw materials, observing discipline, and strengthening worker unity. This challenge has been responded to by factories such as the Ice-making Factory, Chemical Factory, and Nail-making Factory. Workers at the Second Power Plant of the Jibei Electric Power Company are currently overhauling Boiler No. 6 with a spirit of intensive effort, planning to complete this work in sixteen days, whereas it would have taken twenty-four days before liberation. When the overhaul began on the 8th, workers climbed onto the boiler, which had been shut down for less than ten hours, to carry out the work. They did not rest on Sundays during the overhaul. The Tianjin East Station Engineering Section is also using April as a month of intensive effort, planning to intensively repair 201 kilometers of the long-neglected North Ning Railway line under its jurisdiction within the month to ensure safe driving and increase driving speed. Workers in the section have mutually agreed to work one extra hour each day in April, not be late, not leave early, not be absent, not rest on holidays, and inspect work at any time. Workers at the Tianjin Repair Yard of the Tianjin Transportation Company have also decided to overhaul two passenger cars during their spare time this month as a gift to celebrate "May Day." The import section of the Parcel Group of the Postal Bureau has voluntarily organized a commando team to help other busy departments. On the 7th of this month, the commando team assisted the retail department in packing more than 500 parcels. Other departments of the post office are preparing to follow this method of promoting the spirit of mutual assistance and improving work efficiency.
    [Zhang Yuan News] Workers in Zhangjiakou and Xuanhua cities continue to greet "May Day" with practical actions to step up production. In order to complete the April oil production plan of 84,000 catties, all workers of the Zhangyuan Vegetable Oil Factory are working intensively in production. To facilitate oil transportation, six workers in the repair department completed the construction of a 150-meter light railway in eight days, three days ahead of the original plan. A team led by Liu Haiquan in the crushing group voluntarily worked overtime for two hours every day. Zhao Yuxiang's team and Zhao Yushan's team in the oil extraction department competed with each other, producing a total of 12,460 catties of oil in four days, averaging 4,153 catties per day, exceeding the planned daily output of 3,000 catties. The Zhangyuan Brewing Factory has launched a campaign to increase production by half. In the past, 35% corn flour had to be added to the wheat bran used for saccharification. Now, because the price of corn is too high, in order to reduce the cost of alcohol, after months of research, it has now been completely eliminated, and the effectiveness of the wheat bran remains undiminished.
    More than 90 workers at the Xuanhua Paper Mill have launched a hot wave of meritorious service competition. Worker Ma Zhongmin and others voluntarily requested to increase their working hours by four hours. In order to ensure the health of the workers, the administration and the trade union approved an increase of one hour of work and one hour of study from the 5th of this month.
    [Our Newspaper Comprehensive Report] Workers in Jinan, Xuzhou, Zhengzhou and other places are actively preparing to commemorate "May Day." Under the leadership of the preparatory committee of the Jinan Federation of Trade Unions, enterprises and factories in the city established "May Day" preparatory committees, deciding to use the commemoration of "May Day" to enhance the production enthusiasm of all workers, and to enable workers and the general public to truly recognize the leading role and great contributions of the working class in national construction. The preparatory committee of the Xuzhou Federation of Trade Unions held an enlarged meeting, deciding to commemorate the "May Day" holiday, calling on workers of various state-owned enterprises to increase production, save raw materials, improve quality, and give play to creativity to complete and exceed production plans. At the forum of representatives of workers from public and private enterprises and industries held by the Zhengzhou Federation of Trade Unions Preparatory Committee, everyone advocated the establishment of the Zhengzhou Federation of Trade Unions on the "May Day" holiday. Representatives from railways, post offices, electric light companies, and a private iron factory proposed: Before "May Day," launch a vigorous production support-the-frontline competition movement, and hold a grand labor model selection meeting on "May Day."

　　解放区各大城市职工
  　努力生产迎接“五一”
    【新华社天津十八日电】天津市各公营企业工厂职工以努力生产来迎接解放后的第一个“五一”劳动节。市企业公司机器厂职工自四月七日起即自动每日延长工作时间一小时，同时向同种企业公司的其他各厂，发出挑战书，提出提前完成四月份生产计划，改进质量，节省原料，遵守纪律，加强职工团结等竞赛条件。此项挑战已得到制冰、化学、制钉等厂的响应。冀北电力公司第二发电厂职工正以突击精神大检修六号锅炉，计划在十六天内完成此项工作，在解放前则需时二十四天。八日开始检修时，工人们即爬上停火不到十小时的锅炉进行工作。他们在检修中星期日也不休息。天津东站工务段更以四月为突击月，计划月内突击修理该段所辖北宁路二百零一公里的年久失修的路线，以保证行车安全，提高行车速度，该段职工互相约定：四月份内每日多做一小时工作，不迟到、不早退、不欠勤、例假不休息，随时检查工作。天津运输公司天津修养场工人也决定在本月工余时间大修两部客车，作为庆祝“五一”的礼物。邮政局包裹组进口系职工则自动组织了一个突击队帮助其他工作忙碌的部门。本月七日该系突击队即协助门市系装包裹五百余件。这种发扬互助精神提高工作效率的办法，邮局其他部门正准备效法采用。
    【张垣讯】张家口、宣化两市职工，继续以加紧生产的实际行动，来迎接“五一”。张垣植物油厂为了完成四月份出油八万四千斤的计划，全体工人紧张地进行生产。为便利输油，在修建一条一百五十米的轻便铁道时，修理部六名工人，八天功夫就完成了，比原计划早完成三天。粉碎组刘海泉领导的一个班，每日自动加班二小时。榨油部赵玉祥班和赵玉山班互相竞赛，四天共出油一万二千四百六十斤，平均日产四千一百五十三斤，超过日产三千斤的计划。张垣酿造厂，发动了增加半倍产量的运动。制造糖化用的麸曲，从前须加玉米面百分之三十五，现因玉米价格过高，为了减低酒精成本，经月来之研究，现已全部取消而麸曲之效力仍旧不减。
    宣化造纸厂九十余名职工，掀起了立功竞赛热潮，工人马忠民等自动要求增加四小时的工作，为保证职工的身体健康，行政上和工会批准自本月五日起增加一小时工作，一小时学习。
    【本报综合报导】济南徐州郑州等地职工，正积极筹备纪念“五一”。在济南职工总会筹备会领导下，全市企业工厂成立“五一”筹备会，决定用纪念“五一”来提高全体职工的生产积极性，并使职工及广大市民真正认识到工人阶级在国家建设中的领导作用和伟大贡献。徐州市职工联合会筹备会特召开扩大会议，决定纪念“五一”节日，号召各公营企业职工增加生产，节约原料，提高质量，发挥创造性以完成和超过生产计划。郑州职工总会筹委会在所召开的公私企业、行业工人代表座谈会上，大家主张在“五一”节日成立郑市职工总会，铁路、邮局、电灯公司、某私营铁工厂等代表提出：在“五一”节前，发动一个轰轰烈烈的生产支前竞赛运动，并在“五一”节隆重举行选出劳动模范大会。
