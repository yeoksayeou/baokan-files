Criticism and Suggestions

　　Strictly Prohibit Private Use of Public Grain
　　To the editors:
　　On March 10th, when our village went to Changgang Village to collect local grain, we received entirely broken, mixed-color, and foul-smelling rice, which we were very dissatisfied with. Since the North China People's Government promulgated the decree on the unified collection and expenditure of public grain, everyone has welcomed it. When collecting public grain, only good rice was demanded, and the villagers all handed over good rice. But the rice we collected was bad rice, which not only dissatisfied us, but also made the masses feel strange: how did the good rice become bad rice? According to our understanding, some people in Changgang Village had borrowed and eaten the public grain, and some had even taken it to do business, and have yet to return it. This way, good rice is taken out, and bad rice is returned. This practice is absolutely not allowed. We hope that the relevant departments will quickly investigate and strictly prohibit it.

### 严格禁止私用公粮

　　严格禁止私用公粮编者同志：
    三月初十日我村去长岗村取地方粮时，领的完全是半块、杂色、带有臭味的米，我们很不满意。自华北人民政府颁布了公粮统收统支的法令后，人人都很欢迎。在收公粮时要的完全是好米，老乡们也都是交的好米，但我们取的却是坏米，不但我们不满，群众也感到奇怪：交的好米怎么变成坏米了？据了解，原来长岗村公粮有的人借吃了，也有拿去做买卖的，至今还有未还的。这样一来，拿出好米，收回来的便是坏米了，这种做法，实在是不能允许的。希有关部门赶快检查，严格禁止。
