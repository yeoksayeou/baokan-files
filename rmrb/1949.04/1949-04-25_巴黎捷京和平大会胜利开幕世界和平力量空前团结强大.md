　　The World Congress of Supporters of Peace, watched by hundreds of millions of people around the world, grandly opened in the Cultural Hall of Paris on the 20th. The congress was attended by approximately 1,800 representatives from 69 countries, representing different professions, political beliefs, and religions, representing 600 million people determined to fight to defend world peace. After electing the presidium on the first day, the congress is now discussing important issues such as opposing war instigators and establishing a permanent world peace-keeping organization. At the same time, representatives from various countries who were restricted by the reactionary French government and remained in Prague also held a peace conference in Prague on the 20th and announced that this meeting was part of the Paris conference. The holding of the Prague meeting and the protests of people all over the world against the despicable behavior of the French government have dealt a serious blow to the conspiracy of US imperialism and its French running dogs to undermine the peace conference. This solemn and grand meeting is unprecedented in terms of its scale and the mass peace movement it has aroused in many countries. This fact eloquently demonstrates the determination and power of peace-loving people all over the world to destroy the plans of the warmongers headed by US imperialism. This determination and power will inevitably move towards a new upsurge with the strengthening of unity and organization of this conference.

　　The Tenth Congress of Soviet Trade Unions, which plays a pioneering role in the struggle for lasting peace and against warmongers, opened in the Kremlin on the 19th. The meeting was attended by 1,343 representatives from various factories and state-owned farms. Vitorio, acting chairman of the World Federation of Trade Unions, General Secretary Saillant, and trade union representatives from China, France, Britain, North Korea, Mongolia, Czechoslovakia, Poland, the Netherlands, Finland, and other countries attended the conference as guests. The task of the congress is to summarize the achievements of Soviet trade unions in the construction of a socialist society, and further develop the trade union movement, to improve labor productivity, complete the post-war five-year plan ahead of schedule, and to struggle for the construction of a communist society.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 23rd. US and British imperialists are actively working to establish another aggressive "Pacific Pact" based on the model of the North Atlantic Treaty. Under the chairmanship of its ambassador to India, Henderson, diplomatic representatives of the United States in seventeen Southeast Asian countries held a secret meeting in New Delhi from the 4th to the 10th of this month. Two days later, Nehru, the "darling" of US imperialism, convened the so-called Second Asian Conference in New Delhi on the 13th and 24th, attended by eleven countries including India, Burma, Pakistan, Ceylon, and Iran, to discuss helping the Burmese reactionaries carry out anti-people wars and "joint defense" issues. At the same time, in London, the British Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference, which mainly discussed the "Pacific Pact" issue, opened on the 21st. Nehru, who has always claimed that India will never participate in any bloc, admitted when he arrived in Cairo on the 20th on his way to the meeting: "The permanent organization of the Asian Conference will be established soon." Nehru's trickery is a manifestation of his fear in the face of the awakened power of the Asian people.

　　巴黎捷京和平大会胜利开幕世界和平力量空前团结强大
    全世界千千万万人民注目的世界拥护和平大会于二十日上午在巴黎文化厅隆重揭幕。大会到有六十九个国家不同职业、不同政治信仰、不同宗教信仰的代表约一千八百人，代表六万万坚决为保卫世界和平而斗争的人民。大会在第一日选出主席团之后，现正在讨论反对战争挑拨者，建立世界性保卫和平常设机构等重要问题。同时，因遭受法国反动政府限制而留在布拉格的各国代表，亦于二十日在捷京举行拥护和平大会，并宣布这一会议是巴黎大会的一部分。布拉格会议的举行以及全世界人民向法国政府卑鄙行为的抗议，对美帝国主义及其法国走狗们破坏和平大会的阴谋，给了一个严重的打击。这一庄严盛大的会议，就其规模说来，就其在许多国家所引起的群众性争取和平运动说来，是空前的。这一事实雄辩地说明了全世界爱好和平的人民有摧毁以美帝国主义为首的战争贩子计划的决心与力量。这种决心与力量，必然随着这次大会团结与组织之加强，走向新的高涨。
    在争取持久和平与反对战争贩子的斗争中起着先锋作用的苏联职工会第十届代表大会，于十九日在克里姆林宫开幕。会议到有各工厂、国营农场中的代表一千三百四十三名。世界工联代理主席维特利奥、总书记赛扬及中、法、英、朝鲜、蒙古，捷、波、荷、芬等国的职工代表、都以来宾资格出席大会。大会的任务是总结苏联职工会在建设社会主义社会活动中的成果，并进一步发展职工运动，为提高劳动生产率，提前完成战后五年计划，为建设共产主义社会而斗争。
    美、英帝国主义者正在积极活动按照北大西洋公约的模型，建立另一侵略性的“太平洋公约”。在其驻印度大使亨德逊的主持下，美国驻东南亚十七个国家外交代表曾于本月四日至十日在新德里举行秘密会议。两天之后，美帝国主义的“宠儿”尼赫鲁，又于十三日、二十四日在新德里召开印、缅、巴基斯坦、锡兰、伊朗等十一个国家参加的所谓第二次亚洲会议，讨论了帮助缅甸反动派进行反人民战争及“联防”等问题。同时，在伦敦，主要是讨论“太平洋公约”问题的英联邦总理会议于二十一日起开会。一向扬言印度决不参加任何集团的尼赫鲁，已于二十日在赴会途中行抵开罗时承认：“亚洲会议的永久机构，即将成立。”尼赫鲁之所以玩弄欺骗的言词，乃是他在醒觉的亚洲人民力量面前畏缩的表现。
