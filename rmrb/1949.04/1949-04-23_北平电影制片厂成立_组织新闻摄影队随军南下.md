　　Beiping Film Studio Established
  　Organize News Photography Teams to Go South with the Army
    [Beiping City News] The former enemy "China Electric Factory No. 3" was taken over by the Military Control Commission, and after more than two months, it has now been formally transferred by the Military Control Commission to the North China People's Government Cultural and Art Work Committee to establish the "Beiping Film Studio." Comrades Tian Fang and Wang Yang have been appointed as director and deputy director respectively. On the morning of April 20, the factory held a general meeting of all employees, where Comrade Ma Yanxiang, representative of the Military Control Commission, gave a speech, giving a brief report on the Military Control Commission's work in taking over "Factory No. 3," and encouraging the original personnel, hoping that everyone would make more achievements for the people's film industry under the new leadership. Director Comrade Tian Fang pointed out that the main task of the Beiping factory at present is to produce newsreels and documentaries. They now have a large number of news photography teams going south with the army. Deputy Director Comrade Wang Yang reported, focusing on clarifying the issue of unity among colleagues; the issue of transforming old work attitudes and lifestyles; and the issue of strengthening learning. After the meeting, many actors and workers expressed strong agreement with Comrade Wang Yang's criticism of the decadent corruption of the old film circles, with some saying, "What he said is really right, it's exactly what I wanted to say." Now the factory is full of vigor, and all the staff are actively working hard and have begun new work.

    【平市讯】原敌“中电三厂”自军管会接管后，经过两个多月，现由军管会正式移交华北人民政府文化艺术工作委员会成立“北平电影制片厂”。由田方、汪洋二同志分任正副厂长。四月二十日上午，该厂召开职演员工全体大会，由军管会代表马彦祥同志讲话，对军管会接管“三厂”工作结束作了简要的报告，并对原有人员予以鼓励，希望大家在新的领导下，为人民的电影事业做出更多的成绩。厂长田方同志指出：目前北平厂主要是摄制新闻纪录片。他们现已有大批新闻摄影队随军南下。副厂长汪洋同志报告，着重阐明同人间的团结问题；改造旧的工作态度与生活作风问题；加强学习问题。会后，许多演员与工友对于汪洋同志批判旧电影圈的糜烂腐化表示非常同意，有的说：“话说得真对，都是我心里想要说的话。”现在厂内充溢着朝气，全厂人员都积极努力，开始了新的工作。
