　　Commemorating Comrade Li Dazhao
  　The Twenty-Second Anniversary of His Glorious Martyrdom
    Wu Yuzhang
    Our People's Liberation Army's million-strong force has crossed the Yangtze River, Nanjing has been liberated, the Kuomintang reactionary government has been declared defunct, and the revolution is about to achieve complete victory nationwide. Semi-feudal and semi-colonial China will soon be safely transformed into a New Democratic New China. The "rejuvenation of youthful China" that Comrade Li Dazhao yearned for has been realized. Commemorating Comrade Dazhao at this time is of great significance.
    Comrade Dazhao was the earliest advocate and eulogist of Marxism and Bolshevism in China thirty years ago, and the earliest organizer and leader of the Chinese people and the Chinese Communist Party. For China's "rejuvenation and reconstruction," it is necessary to rouse the spirit of revolution and engage in a brutal battle with all kinds of dark forces. In "Youth," he clearly and painfully told Chinese youth:
    "The self-awareness of youth lies in breaking through the net of the past history, destroying the prison of stale doctrines, not allowing僵尸枯骨 (jiangshi kugu -僵尸 refers to hopping vampires and 枯骨 are the bones of the dead.) to bind the lively me of the present, and further letting the youthful me of the present, destroy the youthful me of the past, urge the youthful me of today, to cede to the youthful me of tomorrow... Youth should follow this, base their efforts on reason, move forward without looking back, turn their backs on darkness and face the light, advance civilization for the world, create happiness for mankind, use the youthful me to create a youthful family, a youthful country, a youthful nation, a youthful mankind, a youthful earth, a youthful universe... riding the wind and waves, the journey is far, far away."
    Comrade Dazhao's call motivated young people across the country, especially young people in North China, and especially the students of Peking University, who were most deeply inspired by him. Because he was a professor and librarian at Peking University, he introduced young people to many books on Marxist theory and the victory of Bolshevism, which enabled young people to bravely become active, resulting in the vigorous "May Fourth" Movement. The greatness of this movement lies not only in its thorough and uncompromising anti-imperialist and anti-feudal nature, but especially in the fact that this movement occurred under the call of the world revolution at that time, under the call of the Russian October Revolution, and under the call of Lenin. The "May Fourth" Movement was a part of the proletarian world revolution at that time. The "May Fourth" Movement is an epoch-making symbol of the transition of the Chinese revolution from the old democracy to the new democracy.
    In the "May Fourth" era: when some self-proclaimed progressive thinkers were still vigorously promoting Dewey's and James's pragmatism and Nietzsche's and Bergson's idealism, Comrade Dazhao further expressed thoughts with a dialectical materialist tendency in his works; when some self-proclaimed progressive historians only had fragments of doubt about the past, Comrade Dazhao further attempted to discover the laws of Chinese history by using historical materialism in his article "On the Reasons for the Changes in Modern Chinese Thought Explained from the Economic Perspective."
    Comrade Dazhao's writings on Marxism at that time may not seem mature enough to us today, or, as Mr. Lu Xun said, may have "not necessarily precise aspects," but "his posthumous works will last forever, because they are the legacy of the pioneers, a monument in the history of the revolution" (refer to Lu Xun's inscription for "Complete Works of Shouchang"). What does this mean? This means that a revolutionary: on the one hand, we must look at the process of his ideological development. Comrade Dazhao was a university professor. He transformed from a petty-bourgeois radical democratic revolutionary into a theorist with preliminary communist ideas, and later gradually matured from preliminary communist ideas, eventually becoming a staunch believer in Marxism. This process of ideological development is consistent with the awakening of the Chinese proletariat and the ideological preparation process of the Chinese Communist Party. He constantly transformed his own thinking to keep pace with the times; on the other hand, we must look at his actual actions. Comrade Dazhao's consistent spirit of fighting heroically for Marxism, resolutely fighting against imperialism and feudal warlords, and his high communist integrity and character, established the best model for Communist Party members. If we are a pragmatist, not an empty talker, we must honestly examine the process of our own and others' ideological development, without hypocrisy or exaggeration, and restore his true and original face. What is especially important is to look at the process of his practice. If words and deeds do not match, or even contradict, then even if there are wonderful remarks, it is just a traitor to Marxism, like Kautsky. Precisely because of this, we Communists are not afraid of being still very young, not afraid of not being strong enough, as long as we can grasp not only in words but also in actions the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism combined with Mao Zedong Thought of the Chinese revolution, we can overcome everything. The ideology and strength of us Communists originally came from nothing to something, from small to large, from weak to strong.
    Comrade Dazhao's achievement lies not only in his opposition to all anti-Marxist ideas and theories, but especially in his praise and introduction of Lenin's Bolshevism, which enabled the thinking of Chinese communists and the subsequent establishment of the Chinese Communist Party to embark on the Bolshevik road from the beginning, without being harmed by the opportunism of the Second International. In the world's frenzied anti-Soviet and anti-communist tide, he resolutely stood on the front line of the proletarian world revolution to wage an irreconcilable battle with imperialism and feudal warlords. It is precisely because of this that he and many of his comrades were strangled by the imperialist group and the warlords together. Imperialists are always colluding with our domestic warlords and traitors to strangle our revolution. Since Zhang Zuolin and Chiang Kai-shek, there have been no exceptions. Now the imperialists are still uniting to attack the revolution. The attempt by the British Amethyst and other four warships to block our People's Liberation Army from crossing the river a few days ago is the best proof. But this time it was defeated by the Chinese people. Now the times are different, the era of imperialist domination of the world is over, the Chinese people have stood up, have mastered Marxism-Leninism, have united under the banner of the Chinese Communist Party and Mao Zedong, and have become an incomparably powerful force. Any imperialist, as long as it dares to risk invading the Chinese people and interfering in China's internal affairs, it will inevitably be crushed.
    Today, as we commemorate Comrade Dazhao, we should not only fully recognize this point, but also learn from Comrade Dazhao's revolutionary spirit of being consistent in word and deed, pursuing truth, and transforming society. At the same time, we should not only express it in the revolutionary struggle to destroy the old society, but also in the arduous work of building a new society, so that our revolutionary force will be stronger and our revolutionary cause will advance further.

　　纪念李大钊同志
  　光荣殉难的二十二周年
    吴玉章
    我人民解放军百万大军南渡长江，南京已获得解放，国民党反动政府宣告灭亡，革命即将在全国完全胜利，半封建半殖民地的中国，很快就要安全变成新民主主义的新中国，李大钊同志所企求的“青春中国之再生”已经实现，在这时来纪念大钊同志是有极大的意义的。
    大钊同志是三十年前中国马克思主义及布尔什维主义最早的倡导者，歌颂者，是中国人民及中国共产党最早的组织者和领导者。为着中国之“回春再造”，就必须振起革命的精神与各种各色的黑暗势力进行残酷的战斗，他在“青春”上明白地、沉痛地告诉中国青年说：
    “青年之自觉，一在冲决过去历史之网罗，破坏陈腐学说之囹圄，勿令僵尸枯骨，束缚现在活泼泼地之我，进而纵现在青春之我，扑杀过去青春之我，促今日青春之我，禅让明日青春之我，……青年循蹈乎此，本其理性加以努力，进前而勿顾后，背黑暗而向光明，为世界进文明，为人类造幸福，以青春之我，创造青春之家庭，青春之国家，青春之民族，青春之人类，青春之地球，青春之宇宙……乘风破浪，迢迢乎远矣”。
    大钊同志这一号召推动了全国青年，特别是华北青年，尤其是北京大学青年学生受他的激励最深，因为他是北大教授兼图书馆主任，他介绍青年以许多马克思学说的书籍，及布尔什维主义的胜利，使青年英勇地活跃起来，发生了轰轰烈烈的“五四”运动。这个运动之所以伟大，不仅在于它是彻底的，不妥协的反帝反封建，而尤在这一运动是在当时世界革命号召之下，是在俄国十月革命号召之下，是在列宁号召之下发生的，“五四”运动是当时无产阶级世界革命的一部分。“五四”运动是中国革命由旧民主主义转向到新民主主义的划时代的标志。
    “五四”时代：有些号称进步的思想家还在极力宣扬杜威、詹姆士实验主义及尼采、伯格森的唯心论时，大钊同志就更进一步在他的作品中间带着辩证唯物论倾向的思想；有些号称进步的历史家还仅仅有片断地疑古空气时，大钊同志就更进一步在“由经济上解释中国近代思想变动的原因”一文中，开始运用历史唯物论来作发现中国历史规律的尝试。
    大钊同志当时所写的关于马克思主义的著作，在我们今天看来还不够成熟，或者如鲁迅先生所说的尚有“未必精当的地方”，可是，“他的遗文却将永在，因为他是先驱者的遗产，革命史上的丰碑”（参照鲁迅给“守常全集”的题词）。这是什么意思呢？这就是说，一个革命者：一方面要看他思想发展的过程，大钊同志是一个大学教授，他是从小资产阶级的急进革命的民主主义者转变为具有初步共产主义思想的理论家，以后又从初步的共产主义思想逐渐成熟，终于成了一个坚强的马克思主义信徒，他这一思想发展过程与中国无产阶级的觉醒以及中国共产党思想的准备过程的经历是一致的。他是不断地改造自己的思想，使之随时代前进；另一方面还要看他实际的行动，大钊同志一贯为马克思主义而英勇奋斗的原则精神，坚决同帝国主义和封建军阀作不屈不挠的斗争，他的高度共产主义的气节和操守，是树立了共产党员最好的模范。如果我们是一个实事求是者，而不是一个空谈家，就必须老老实实考察自己和他人思想发展的过程，不虚伪，不夸张，而还他一个真实的、本来的面目，尤其重要的是要看他实践的过程，如果言行不符，甚至相反，则虽有美妙的言论，也不过是马克思主义的叛徒，如考茨基之流罢了。正因为如此，所以我们共产党人不怕自己还很幼稚，不怕自己还不够强大，只要我们不仅在言论上而且在行动中能够掌握着马列主义的普遍真理与中国革命实践相结合的毛泽东思想，我们就能够战胜一切。我们共产党人的思想和共产党的力量原是从无到有，从小到大，从弱到强。
    大钊同志的功绩，不仅在于他反对一切反马克思主义的思想学说，而尤在于他赞扬和介绍列宁的布尔什维主义，使中国的共产主义者的思想及后来中国共产党的成立，一开始就走上布尔什维克的道路，不受第二国际等机会主义的毒害。他在全世界疯狂反苏反共的潮流中，坚决地站在无产阶级世界革命的战线上，来和帝国主义及封建军阀作不调和的战斗，正因为如此，他才被帝国主义者集团和军阀一同来绞杀他及他的许多同道者，帝国主义者随时都是勾结我们国内的军阀、卖国贼来绞杀我们的革命。自张作霖以及蒋介石等毫无例外。现在帝国主义者仍在联合向革命进攻。前几天英国紫石英等四个军舰企图阻挡我人民解放军渡江，就是最好的证明。但这一次却被中国人民打败了。现在时代已经不同了，帝国主义统治世界的时期已成过去了，中国人民已经站起来了，已经掌握了马克思列宁主义，已经团结在中国共产党和毛泽东旗帜之下，成了强大无比的力量，任何帝国主义者，只要它敢于冒险来侵犯中国人民，干涉中国内政，它就必归于粉碎。
    今天我们纪念大钊同志，我们不仅应当充分认识这一点，而且要学习大钊同志这种言行一致为追求真理改造社会的革命精神，同时不仅要表现在破坏旧社会的革命斗争中，而且要表现在建设新社会的艰巨工作里，使我们的革命力量更雄厚，使我们的革命事业更前进。
