Based on the principle of "those who use the road maintain the road," the North China People's Government has formulated the "Interim Measures for the North China Region to Collect Road Maintenance Fees from Automobiles and Rubber-tired Carts," and hereby announces it to all highway transportation personnel, agencies, businesses, and individuals in this region for compliance. The original text of the measures is as follows:

    Article 2: These measures shall be implemented by the North China Highway General Bureau and the provincial and municipal (administrative office) transportation authorities, which shall establish management offices or entrust and authorize agency stations on designated highway trunk lines.
    Article 3: All automobiles and rubber-tired carts used for profit, regardless of whether they are publicly or privately operated, shall be charged road maintenance fees according to the following regulations: 1. Automobiles: A fee of 5% to 8% shall be levied on the freight price. The specific fee rate shall be formulated and promulgated by the North China Highway General Bureau for implementation. 2. Rubber-tired carts: Fees shall be collected monthly per set: (1) Single-set carts shall be charged a monthly road maintenance fee of 500 yuan (equivalent to 25 jin of millet). (2) Double-set carts shall be charged a monthly road maintenance fee of 800 yuan (equivalent to 40 jin of millet). (3) Three-set carts shall be charged a monthly road maintenance fee of 1,100 yuan (equivalent to 55 jin of millet).

Automobiles with permits must truthfully fill out a payment form before departure, report to the management office/station to pay the fee, obtain a road pass, and travel along the designated route. If additional passengers or goods are transported en route, it must be clearly stated in the "Additional Transport" column of the road pass, and a supplementary fee must be reported and paid upon arrival. 3. Rubber-tired carts shall pay the monthly road maintenance fee to the management office/station and obtain a highway vehicle license plate before freely traveling.
    Article 5: Those who violate the fee payment regulations in the preceding article may be fined one to five times the amount of the undeclared freight price, depending on the severity of the circumstances.
    Article 6: Automobiles and rubber-tired carts traveling to and from neighboring regions (such as the Northeast, East China, and Central Plains regions) shall not be charged again after paying fees in this region. The method for mutual subsidy of road maintenance fees between neighboring regions shall be negotiated and determined by the relevant regions.
    Article 7: The following regulations govern refunds, reductions, and exemptions: 1. Military transport in support of the war that is purely of a mobilization nature, or for which only cost-based compensation is issued, shall be exempt from fees. 2. After paying the monthly fee and obtaining a license, if a rubber-tired cart does not operate for more than twenty days due to vehicle damage or livestock death, a certificate from a government above the village level may be presented to the original fee-collecting agency for a pro-rata refund.
    Article 8: These measures shall come into effect on the date of promulgation. The detailed rules for implementation shall be separately determined by the North China Highway General Bureau.
