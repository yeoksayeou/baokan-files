　　▲The Preparatory Committee of the Beiping Municipal Trade Union Federation issued a protest stating: After the Kailuan mine disaster, the Kailuan miners put forward a protest and four demands to the mine authorities. The Beiping workers resolutely support the opinions of the Kailuan brothers, and these conditions are completely reasonable. They also warned the capitalists of Kailuan Coal Mine: The policy of "developing production with benefits for both labor and capital" is the economic guideline of the New Democracy, which is not allowed to be violated by anyone. The government's laws and decrees are not allowed to be despised and sabotaged by anyone. Quickly and satisfactorily answer the workers' reasonable conditions and correct your mistakes, otherwise the workers in our Tianjin and Tangshan areas will no longer tolerate your illegal behavior. The four conditions must be accepted, and we will never give up until the goal is achieved!
    ▲Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant received the news of successive disasters at Kailuan Tangshan Mine. The blackboard newspaper and worker's gazette first called on all workers in the plant to unite and support the workers in Tangshan. Many study groups held meetings that night to discuss. Mu Baoxuan, a worker in the iron smelting plant, said: "Now that we are liberated, things cannot be the same as under the Kuomintang rule. Such things must not be allowed to happen." Cao Hongsen, a worker in the raw materials section, said: "This kind of unreasonable thing must be eradicated, and the workers in all liberated areas should unite." In addition, the preparatory committee of the workers' union issued a protest letter on behalf of all workers in the plant to support the workers in Kailuan.
    ▲After hearing about the Kailuan Coal Mine incident in Tangshan, all the employees of the Beiping Telecommunications Bureau's long-distance station issued a notice to more than 3,000 employees in all units of the entire telecommunications bureau yesterday, initiating donations to comfort the dead and injured worker brothers in Kailuan Coal Mine. They also asked all employees to generally write letters to comfort the victimized workers and their families. Now all employees are taking action for this incident. The staff preparatory committee of the telecommunications bureau issued a protest letter to the capitalists of Kailuan.
    ▲All the employees of Tongzhou Power Plant also protested against the capitalists of Kailuan Coal Mine and wrote letters to comfort the victimized workers in Kailuan.
