[Jizhong Electric] Wen'an, a waterlogged area, is using cooperatives as the core to organize labor mutual aid for fishing, weaving reed mats, reclaiming wasteland, rushing to plant spring wheat, and preparing to plant rice. The tenth and eleventh districts, relying on the reed weaving cooperatives of four villages, organized 1,932 households from 31 villages to weave mats, 512 people in 78 groups to weave reed mats (with another 897 people weaving mats individually), 430 people twisting warp threads, 68 households weaving nets, 567 people in 70 boats dredging reed residue, 168 people in eight fish shops, 587 households in 29 groups using large reed fences to catch fish, and 596 households in 58 groups using small reed fences. Fishing and reed mat weaving are now very profitable, solving the livelihood problems of the disaster victims. For example, Xing Bingxu and seven others from Xinge Village used two large reed fences to catch fish, yielding 70 jin of fish per day, priced at 20 yuan per jin (Renminbi, same below), earning a total of 210 yuan in half a month. Fan Xiuzhi, a women's representative from Ximatou, has earned the equivalent of 240 jin of corn from twisting warp threads and weaving fishing mats since the first month of the lunar year. Ma Xiangfu, a party member from Ximatou, and eight others, based on the opinions of fishers and mat weavers, organized a fish industry supply and marketing cooperative to buy reeds to supply to cooperative members for weaving mats, and purchased fish from cooperative members at prices higher than the market price, then transported them to Tianjin to exchange for daily necessities, which were sold to cooperative members at prices lower than the market price. Currently, Wen'an water country is actively organizing mutual aid groups in the production campaign, making a concentrated effort to rush to plant barley. In order to plant and harvest early, the masses are preparing small awn rice, drying rice seeds, repairing iron shovels and rakes, and ordering farming tools such as plows, preparing to start building rice paddies and rush to cultivate and plant water-receded land (i.e., land exposed after the water recedes).

    【冀中电】文安水灾区以合作社为核心组织劳动互助，捕鱼、打箔、开荒、抢种春麦，并准备种稻。十、十一区依靠四个村的席苇合作社，组织了三十一个村共一千九百三十二户织席，七十八组共五百一十二人打箔（尚有单独打箔的八百九十七人），另有搓经子的四百三十人，打丝网的六十八户，掏苇楂的七十只船共五百六十七人，鱼店八个共一百六十八人，下大箔治鱼的二十九组共五百八十七户，下小箔的五十八组共五百九十六户。治鱼打箔，现在都很赚钱，解决了灾民生活问题。如辛各庄邢秉绪等八人，用两个大箔治鱼，每天出鱼七十斤，每斤价二十元（人民币下同），半月共得二百一十元。西码头妇女代表范秀芝从正月到现在搓经子打鱼箔即挣玉米二百四十斤。西码头党员马祥福等九人根据治鱼和打箔户的意见，组织了鱼业供销合作社，买席供给社员打箔，并以较高于市价的价格收买社员的鱼，再运到天津换回日用必需品，低于市价卖给社员。现文安水乡，在开展生产运动中，正积极组织互助组，突击赶种大麦，群众为了早种早收，正筹备小芒稻，晒稻种籽，修理铁锨、铁耙，订购耠子等农具，准备开始打稻池和抢耕抢种水脱地（即水退地出）。
