Memorial Poem for the "April 8th" Martyrs
  　Also Dedicated to Madam Li Peizhi, Wife of Wang Ruofei
    Liu Yazi
　　　　　(1)
　
    I first met Li Peizhi at Cengyan, and Liang, Meng, Liu, and Fan are in my thoughts.
    In one evening, the sky collapsed and the sea shattered, and meeting again brings the grief of a widowed swan and a bereaved phoenix.
    Endless hatred lingers in the yellow earth with tears, but history will record your meritorious deeds on a righteous stele.
    I am relieved to see the Xie family's beautiful daughter is well, her virtue like orchids, pure as jade, and in her prime.
    (2)
　
    The heartbreaking history of Black Tea Mountain, the deep gratitude for your close friend's kindness feels like Ruofei himself.
    I had no chance to repay Bo Gu, and once again missed Xi Yi as we passed each other by.
    Who can atone for killing such good people; we sing the Yellow Bird elegy, never forget to report to the Red Flag at the family altar.
    Most tragic is the whole family perishing together, and beyond the grief for Xiuwen, we mourn the fallen Yangmei.
　
    (3)
　
    Speaking of Yangmei, my sorrow deepens; her intelligence and wisdom are beyond doubt.
    She once escaped the nets of bad men, able to recite the poems of the Three Tangs and Two Songs.
    Her rock-splitting singing still echoes in my ears, and her rainbow-like sword spirit is worthy of contemplation.
    Unforgettable is the memorial on Fuyu Island, where Li Mei wielded her pen to write.
　
    (4)
　
    We cannot compensate for the loss of these heroes, their fate resembles that of Guan and Zhang, a similar regret.
    Following Lu and preceding Wang, we grieve for Deng Fa, and the pain of He's nephew and Xie's uncle over Huang Weng.
    Lofty graves were soon visited by earth-carrying crowds, but the evil news of grave robbing still spreads.
    Awaiting the day to pour a cup of wine towards Yan’an, a monument will still be erected [unrecognized character].

　　“四八”烈士纪念诗
  　兼赠王若飞夫人李培之女士
    柳亚子
　　　　　（一）
　
    曾岩初识李培之，梁孟刘樊系我思。
    一夕天崩兼海裂，重逢鹄寡更鸾悲。
    黄垆涕泪无穷恨，青史勋名有道碑。
    差喜谢庭娇女好，兰薰玉洁正芳时。
    （二）
　
    黑茶山畔伤心史，知己恩深感若飞。
    一面无缘偿博古，重来交臂失希夷。
    歼良谁赎歌黄鸟，家祭毋忘告赤旗。
    最是阖门同殉惨，秀文面外陨扬眉。
　
    （三）
　
    说到扬眉我更悲，聪明智慧不须疑。
    曾逃吉网罗钳厄，能诵三唐两宋诗。
    裂石歌声犹在耳，如虹剑气正堪思。
    难忘纪念扶余岛，濡笔为文有李湄。
　
    （四）
　
    难偿损失尽群雄，无命关张恨略同。
    卢后王前悲邓发，何甥谢舅痛黄翁。
    高坟早见衔泥众，恶耗还传发冢凶。
    待向延京奠杯酒，丰碑依旧树＠＠。
