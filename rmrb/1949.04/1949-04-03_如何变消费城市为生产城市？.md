　　How to Transform a Consumer City into a Productive City?
Editor's Note: Since the publication of the editorial "Transforming Consumer Cities into Productive Cities" in this newspaper on March 17th, this important matter has sparked discussion among readers. Taking Beiping as an example, transforming this city of over two million people into a productive city is by no means an easy task. There are many issues involved, and how to begin and which problems must be resolved are complex questions. We are now publishing letters from Mr. Li Qun, Mr. Wang Gengyao, and Mr. Zhuang Jingru, and we hope that readers from all over the country will participate enthusiastically in this discussion in the spirit of "serving the people" to achieve the benefits of collective wisdom.

Editor: After reading the editorial "Transforming Consumer Cities into Productive Cities," I feel that this is indeed a very important issue that should be resolved quickly.

How should we start transforming Beiping, for example, from a consumer city to a productive city? I think the first step should be to restore and develop industrial production (including both public and private factories) to produce a large number of industrial products. This will not only allow us to exchange these goods for a large amount of grain and raw materials from the countryside, supporting the development of the rural economy and allowing the city to lead the countryside, but also solve the employment problem for some unemployed workers and technicians. Of course, in order to achieve the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas, it is also necessary to transform and develop commerce that is beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood. In particular, attention should be paid to developing state-owned commerce and establishing supply and marketing cooperatives, in order to reduce intermediate exploitation and develop social productivity. When organizing supply and marketing cooperatives, various production groups or factories of cooperative members can also be organized to organize the scattered independent small producers and the vast urban poor in the city to carry out production, so that this large city with many consumers can gradually be transformed into a large city with many producers.

These are just my opinions. I hope to be corrected if they are incorrect. It would be best to publish them in the newspaper so that everyone can start a discussion.
　　　　　　　　　　Li Qun, March 28th

Editor: We were very excited to read your newspaper's editorial: "Transforming Consumer Cities into Productive Cities." We have not yet read the following articles on how to implement this policy. We plan to engage in household production to cooperate with this policy. We don't know if this is right? Our three families have a total of three sewing machines. We want to sew Chinese or Western-style shirts and pants. We can also buy some cloth ourselves and sew the clothes. The problem is that we have no way to sell them, and no one can sell them in the market or set up a stall. We need a cooperative to collect our finished products, pay us for labor and materials, or lend us cloth, specify the size and style of the clothes, and pay us reasonable wages; or establish large sewing factories and adopt a decentralized operation method, so that we can also join cooperative organizations. Please introduce and explain the above. Also, we have five or six working women who hope to engage in other forms of production while still taking care of their families. Is this possible? Please advise us.

### 如何变消费城市为生产城市？

专栏：问题讨论

　　如何变消费城市为生产城市？
    编者按：自本报三月十七日发表了“把消费城市变为生产城市”的社论后，由于此事重大，已引起读者对这一问题的讨论，就以北平来说：如何把这二百多万人口的城市，变为生产城市，绝不是一件轻而易举的事情，其中问题很多，如何着手，必须解决那些问题？就很复杂。现在我们特发表里群、王赓尧、庄镜如三位先生的来信，希望本报各地读者，都本着“为人民服务”的精神，热烈的来参加这个讨论，以收群策群力之效。编辑先生：我读了“把消费城市变为生产城市”的社论以后，觉得这的确是一个非常重要，而且应当赶快解决的问题。
    就以北平来说，究应如何着手改变这个消费城市为生产城市呢？我认为：第一步应先恢复和发展工业生产（包括公私工厂）入手，生产出大量的工业品来，这不仅可以到农村换回大量的粮食和原料，扶助农村经济的发展，使城市领导乡村；而且可以解决一部分失业工人和技术人员的工作问题。当然为了达到城乡物资的交换，改造和发展有利国计民生的商业也是必要的设施。特别要注意发展国营商业和普遍建立供销合作社，才能减除中间剥削与发展社会的生产力。组织供销合作社时，还可以组织社员的各种生产小组或工厂，以便把城市里散漫的独立的小生产者与广大的城市贫民组织起来进行生产，才能使这个消费者多的大城市逐渐转变为生产者多的大城市。
    这只是我的一点意见，是否正确，还希望指正，最好能在报上发表，让大家展开讨论。
  　　　　　　　　　　里群　三月二十八日编者先生：读了贵报社论：“把消费城市变成生产城市”，使我们很兴奋。如何贯彻此项政策，现在还没有读到下文。我们打算从事家庭生产，来配合此项政策，不知道对不对？我们三家一共凑有三部缝纫机，想缝制中式或西式的衬衫裤，我们也可以自己先买一点布，把衣服缝起来。问题是我们没有方法卖出去，也没有人能在市场上专门兜售或者摆小摊。需要有合作社收我们的成品，付给我们工料费，或者贷给我们布匹，指定衣服的尺寸样式，给我们以合理的工资；或者创办大的缝，厂，采取分散经营的方法，使我们也加入合作组织。以上请费神介绍，并予以解释。再，我们有五六位劳动妇女，希望能作其他方式的生产而又能照料家务，是否可以？请多多指教。　　　　　　王赓尧、庄镜如
