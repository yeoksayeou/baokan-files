　　The Kuomintang's Twenty-Two Years of Betrayal of the Revolution

　　Twenty-two years ago today, on April 12, 1927, the Kuomintang reactionaries, headed by Chiang Kai-shek, launched a brutal massacre against the Chinese Communist Party and the working class in Shanghai. Shortly after this, counter-revolutionary massacres spread rapidly wherever the Kuomintang's power extended. Upon the blood of countless revolutionary martyrs, the Kuomintang reactionaries established the counter-revolutionary Nanjing government, implementing a counter-revolutionary policy of national betrayal, dictatorship, and civil war. Except for a portion of loyal, unwavering true followers of Sun Yat-sen and genuine friends of the Communist Party, the entire Kuomintang and the Kuomintang government became a bastion of counter-revolution in China from that point on, with Chiang Kai-shek and his cronies as the core of this counter-revolutionary bastion, right up to the present.

　　The losses inflicted upon the Chinese nation and people by this great betrayal of the Kuomintang reactionaries are truly incalculable. Since the May Fourth Movement of 1919, since the founding of the Chinese Communist Party in 1921, and since the Kuomintang implemented reorganization with the full assistance of the Chinese Communist Party in 1924, adopting revolutionary programs and policies, the strength of the Chinese people rose day by day, and the Chinese people's hopes for the nation's future rose day by day. This hope reached its peak after the Shanghai workers' armed seizure of Shanghai in March 1927. At that time, the Chinese people were so jubilant and proud, believing that decades of imperialist domination and two thousand years of feudal rule could be ended from then on. The inexperienced and unwary young Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese working class it led overestimated the upper echelons of the Chinese bourgeoisie, and overestimated the Kuomintang, which represented the upper echelons of the Chinese bourgeoisie, a Kuomintang that had only been able to revive with the assistance of the Chinese Communist Party and the International Communist Party. In the blink of an eye, the bourgeois reactionaries, who hated Chinese workers and peasants far more than they "hated" imperialism and feudalism, threw themselves into the arms of yesterday's "enemies," using the blood of yesterday's benefactors as a gift. The reactionary Kuomintang thus became the party of the big landlords and big bourgeoisie of China. Under its rule, China fell into astonishing darkness and terror. Chiang Kai-shek and his Nanjing Kuomintang counter-revolutionary government sold out national sovereignty to foreign powers, initially relying on Japanese imperialism, leading to the fourteen years of great aggression since the "September 18th Incident" of 1931; then relying on American imperialism, so that even now the iron hooves of American invaders remain in places like Nanjing, Shanghai, Qingdao, Taiwan, and Hainan Island. Domestically, Chiang Kai-shek and his Nanjing Kuomintang government ruled China for twenty-two years, fighting almost twenty-two years of counter-revolutionary civil war. From 1936 until the Japanese surrender in 1945, although a nationwide civil war did not occur, considerable and smaller attacks on the People's Liberation Army never ceased. In order to carry out the counter-revolutionary civil war, Chiang Kai-shek and his Nanjing Kuomintang government organized an unprecedentedly large counter-revolutionary army, which committed all kinds of evil under the command of counter-revolutionaries, killing, arson, and perpetrating every atrocity. Chiang Kai-shek and his Nanjing Kuomintang government implemented brutal rule of terror in the Kuomintang-controlled areas. In the past twenty-two years, tens of thousands of patriotic people have died in Chiang Kai-shek's execution grounds, secret prisons, and assassinations. Why did the Kuomintang reactionaries organize a counter-revolutionary army and counter-revolutionary regime, and why did they carry out twenty-two years of counter-revolutionary war and counter-revolutionary dictatorship? The purpose was none other than to extract the blood and sweat of the people; and in order to maintain this counter-revolutionary army and counter-revolutionary regime; in order to support this counter-revolutionary war, even more of the people's blood and sweat had to be extracted. Therefore, for twenty-two years, on the one hand, there was widespread poverty and economic decline, and on the other hand, there was a huge concentration of the bureaucratic comprador capital of the four families of Chiang, Song, Kong, and Chen. This situation left the broad masses of all democratic classes throughout the country with no other way out than to unite and overthrow the heinous rule of Chiang Kai-shek and his Nanjing Kuomintang government.

　　The extreme viciousness of Chiang Kai-shek and his Nanjing Kuomintang government lies not only in their execution of the aforementioned reactionary policies, but also in their repeated contempt for the opportunities for self-correction that the people gave them. After Chiang Kai-shek carried out the "April 12th" counter-revolutionary massacre and the ten years of counter-revolutionary civil war after "April 12th," the Chinese Communist Party and the revolutionary people of China repaid evil with good, releasing the arrested Chiang Kai-shek in the Xi'an Incident of 1936, hoping that he and the Nanjing Kuomintang government could resist Japan alongside the people of the whole country. But before long, Chiang Kai-shek and his Nanjing (moved to Chongqing between 1938 and 1945) Kuomintang government relapsed into their old ways, passively resisting Japan and actively opposing communism, causing the main force of the anti-Japanese Eighth Route Army and New Fourth Army to fall into the predicament of being attacked from both sides. After the end of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the Chinese Communist Party and the revolutionary people of China gave Chiang Kai-shek and his Nanjing Kuomintang government repeated opportunities, asking him to adopt a policy of peace and unity. But Chiang Kai-shek and his Nanjing Kuomintang government, incorrigibly evil, repeatedly tore up the Double Tenth Agreement of 1945, the ceasefire order of January 10, 1946, the resolutions of the Political Consultative Conference of January 31 of the same year, and many other agreements, and brazenly launched an unprecedented counter-revolutionary civil war, causing the Chinese people, after eight years of War of Resistance Against Japan, to suffer large-scale devastation by the Kuomintang counter-revolutionary army. Twenty-two years of history have repeatedly proven that Chiang Kai-shek and his Nanjing Kuomintang government are so ungrateful, so two-faced, and so incorrigibly evil!

　　Chinese history has taken a great reversal today. Twenty-two years after the Kuomintang's betrayal of the revolution, the Nanjing Kuomintang government, defeated in the recent war, is asking the Chinese Communist Party for a truce. The Chinese Communist Party, representing the Chinese People's Liberation Army, has once again made a generous gesture, willing to hold peace talks under eight peace conditions. These eight conditions have been unanimously supported by the Chinese people and various democratic parties, and also endorsed by many people in the Nanjing Kuomintang government. Under these circumstances, Chiang Kai-shek announced his "retirement," and Li Zongren, who expressed his willingness to accept the CCP's peace terms, took over his position as "President" of the Nanjing Kuomintang government. Li Zongren has now sent a delegation to hold peace talks with the Chinese Communist Party. Obviously, China has entered a change that is exactly the opposite of what it was twenty-two years ago. As we look back on these twenty-two years of history, our hearts are filled with sorrow for the martyrs who have followed one another and died for the revolutionary cause over the past twenty-two years, filled with hatred for the counter-revolutionary criminals who have been filled with evil over the past twenty-two years, and at the same time, we cannot but grasp the necessary lessons. The necessary lesson is that the Chinese landlord class and the bureaucratic bourgeoisie have no "love" and no "good intentions" for the Chinese nation and people. The necessary lesson is that Chiang Kai-shek and his cronies, the leaders of the Chinese landlord class and bureaucratic bourgeoisie for twenty-two years, have always been committed to eliminating the Chinese Communist Party and the democratic forces of the Chinese people, and they will not rest in peace until this goal is achieved. The necessary lesson is that those in the bloody Nanjing Kuomintang government who are willing to redeem themselves, if they sincerely seek the people's final forgiveness, must break with Chiang Kai-shek and his cronies, break with imperialism, and surrender to the people completely and unconditionally. On this 22nd anniversary of "April 12th," the people of the whole country should be fully vigilant: Isn't Chiang Kai-shek, the chief culprit of "April 12th" and the chief culprit of all the crimes of murdering the people since "April 12th," still commanding his cronies in Xikou Town, Fenghua County, Zhejiang Province, and wielding the power of life and death? Aren't Chiang Kai-shek's cronies Sun Ke, Wu Tiecheng, Song Ziwen, Chen Lifu, Chiang Ching-kuo, Zheng Yanfen, Zheng Jiemin, Wang Shijie, and Lei Zhen openly coming and going in Xikou, "requesting instructions"? If Chiang Kai-shek does not allow Zhang Xueliang and Yang Hucheng to be released, Zhang Xueliang and Yang Hucheng cannot be released; if Chiang Kai-shek wants Okamura Neiji to be released, Okamura Neiji cannot but be released; if Chiang Kai-shek is not satisfied with Chen Yi, Chen Yi cannot but be dismissed, arrested, and detained in Quzhou; if Chiang Kai-shek is satisfied with Huang Shao-gu, the Nanjing Kuomintang government cannot but appoint Huang Shao-gu as Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan. The Kuomintang is still openly promoting Chiang Kai-shek as the leader of the Kuomintang, and the Kuomintang is the leader of the Nanjing "National Government," and "all my comrades" must act in accordance with Chiang Kai-shek's instructions. This propaganda is, of course, paving the way for Chiang Kai-shek's restoration. Chiang Kai-shek and his surviving cronies have not only not laid down their weapons, but also do not admit defeat; even if the people's democratic revolution is victorious in the whole of China, it is only "a ripple in the global anti-communist struggle" for them. Therefore, if we do not take a serious attitude towards Chiang Kai-shek and his incorrigible cronies, raise revolutionary vigilance, and if we do not take a serious attitude towards the counter-revolutionary Kuomintang and its imperialist backers, and abandon any illusions, then the Chinese people cannot achieve peace, democracy, and independence. Twenty-two years of bloody lessons are before us, let us arm our minds with these lessons and use them as our guiding lights!

### 国民党叛变革命的二十二年

　　国民党叛变革命的二十二年
    二十二年前的今天，一九二七年的四月十二日，以蒋介石为首的国民党反动派向中国共产党和上海的工人阶级举行了残酷的大屠杀。在这以后不久，在国民党势力所及之处，反革命屠杀迅速蔓延。在无数革命先烈的鲜血之上，国民党反动派建立了反革命的南京政府，实行了卖国独裁内战的反革命政策。除了一部分坚贞不屈的孙中山的真实信徒和共产党的真实友人以外，整个国民党和国民党政府从此成了中国反革命的堡垒，而以蒋介石及其死党为这一反革命堡垒的核心，直到现在。
    国民党反动派的这个大叛变，对于中国的民族和人民所造成的损失，真是不可胜计。自从一九一九年“五四”运动以来，自从一九二一年中国共产党成立以来，自从一九二四年国民党在中国共产党全力帮助之下实行改组，采取革命的纲领和政策以来，中国人民的力量日益上升，中国人民对于民族前途的希望日益上升，这种希望在一九二七年三月上海工人武装夺取上海以后达到了顶点。中国人民这时曾经何等欢欣鼓舞，扬眉吐气，以为数十年来帝国主义的支配，两千年来封建主义的统治，可以从此结束。缺乏经验和警惕的年轻的中国共产党和它所领导的中国工人阶级，对于中国资产阶级上层分子是看得太好了，对于代表中国资产阶级上层分子的国民党，对于这个仅仅由于中国共产党和国际共产党的援助才得以起死回生的国民党，是看得太好了。一转眼间，仇视中国工人农民比“仇视”帝国主义封建主义远甚的资产阶级反动派，就投入了昨日的“敌人”的怀中，而以昨日的恩人的鲜血作为贡献。反动的国民党从此成为中国大地主大资产阶级的政党，在它的统治之下，中国陷入惊人的黑暗和恐怖。蒋介石及其南京国民党反革命政府，对外出卖国权，始则投靠日本帝国主义，引起一九三一年“九一八”以来十四年的大侵略；继则投靠美国帝国主义，至今美国侵略者的铁蹄，还留在南京、上海、青岛、台湾、海南岛等地。在对内方面，蒋介石及其南京国民党政府统治中国二十二年，几乎就打了二十二年反革命内战，从一九三六年到一九四五年日本投降以前，全国规模的内战虽然没有发生，但是对于人民解放军的相当大的和较小的进攻都一直没有停止。为了进行反革命内战，蒋介石及其南京国民党政府组织了空前庞大的反革命军队，这个军队在反革命的指挥之下杀人放火，无恶不作。对于国民党统治区的人民，蒋介石及其南京国民党政府实行野蛮的恐怖统治。二十二年来，死于蒋介石的刑场、秘密监狱和暗杀的爱国志士，数以万计。国民党反动派为什么组织反革命军队和反革命政权，为什么进行二十二年的反革命战争和反革命专政呢？其目的不是别的，就是为了搜刮人民的血汗；而为了维持这个反革命军队和反革命政权；为了支持这个反革命战争，又须搜刮更多的人民的血汗，因此二十二年来，一方面是普遍的民穷财尽，经济凋敝，另一方面却是蒋宋孔陈四大家族的官僚买办资本的巨大的集中。这种情形，使得全国各个民主阶层的广大人民，除了团结一致，起来推翻蒋介石及其南京国民党政府的万恶统治之外，再无别的出路。
    蒋介石及其南京国民党政府的穷凶极恶，不但在于他们执行上述种种反动的政策，而且在于他们再三地蔑视人民留给他们的改过自新的机会。在蒋介石进行了“四一二”的反革命屠杀和“四一二”以后十年间的反革命内战以后，中国共产党和中国的革命人民以德报怨，在一九三六年西安事变中释放了被逮捕的蒋介石，希望他和南京国民党政府能与全国人民一道抗日。但是为时不久，蒋介石及其南京（在一九三八年至一九四五年间迁往重庆）国民党政府故态复萌，消极抗日，积极反共，致使抗日的主力八路军新四军陷于腹背受敌的困难。抗日战争结束以后，中国共产党和中国的革命人民又给蒋介石及其南京国民党政府接连多次的机会，要他采取和平团结的政策。但是怙恶不悛的蒋介石及其南京国民党政府，连续撕毁一九四五年的双十协议，一九四六年一月十日的停战令，同年一月三十一日的政治协商会议决议，以及其他的多次协议，悍然发动空前的反革命大内战，使中国人民在八年抗日战争之余，又遭受了国民党反革命军队的大规模的蹂躏。二十二年的历史，就是这样反复地证明了蒋介石及其南京国民党政府，如此忘恩负义，如此口蜜腹剑，如此怙恶不悛！
    中国的历史，在今天来了一个大反复。在国民党叛变革命的二十二年以后的今天，在最近的战争中战败了的南京国民党政府向中国共产党要求停战。代表中国人民解放军的中国共产党，又一次作了宽大的表示，愿意在八项和平条件下举行和平谈判。这八项条件被中国人民和各民主党派所一致拥护，也被南京国民党政府中许多人所赞同。在这种情况下，蒋介石宣布“退休”，而由表示愿意接受中共和平条件的李宗仁代理他的作为南京国民党政府“总统”的职务。李宗仁现在已经派出代表团来与中国共产党举行和平谈判。很明显，中国是进入了一个与二十二年前恰恰相反的变化。当我们回顾这二十二年的历史的时候，我们的心中是充满了对于二十二年来前仆后继、为革命事业死难的先烈的哀思，充满了对于二十二年来恶贯满盈的反革命罪犯的痛恨，而在同时，我们还不能不领会必要的教训。必要的教训，就是中国地主阶级和官僚资产阶级对于中国的民族和人民决没有一点“爱情”，决没有一点“好心眼”。必要的教训，就是中国地主阶级和官僚资产阶级二十二年来的首脑蒋介石及其死党，无时无刻不以消灭中国共产党和中国人民民主力量为职志，此志不遂，死不瞑目。必要的教训，就是充满血腥的南京国民党政府中的愿意立功自赎的分子，如果真诚地要求人民的最后的谅解，就只有与蒋介石及其死党实行决裂，与帝国主义实行决裂，无保留地彻底地向人民投降。当此“四一二”二十二周年之际，全国人民应当充分警惕地注意：“四一二”的元凶和“四一二”以来一切屠杀人民罪案的元凶蒋介石，难道不还在浙江省奉化县溪口镇指挥着他的死党，并且操着生杀予夺之权吗？蒋介石的死党孙科、吴铁城、宋子文、陈立夫、蒋经国、郑彦＠、郑介民、王世杰、雷震之徒，难道不是公然地在溪口来来往往，“请求指示”吗？蒋介石不让释放张学良、杨虎城，张学良、杨虎城就不能释放；蒋介石要释放冈村宁次，冈村宁次就不能不释放；蒋介石不满意陈仪，陈仪就不能不被解职、被逮捕、被拘禁于衢州；蒋介石满意黄少谷，南京国民党政府就不能不任命黄少谷为行政院秘书长。国民党现在仍然公开宣传蒋介石是国民党的领导者，而国民党又是南京“国民政府”的领导者，“凡我同志”，务须依照蒋介石的指示行事。这种宣传，当然是为蒋介石的复辟铺平道路的。蒋介石及其残存的死党不但还没有放下武器，而且并不承认失败；纵然人民民主革命在全中国胜利，对于他们也不过是“世界反共斗争中的一道波纹”吧了。因此，如果不对于蒋介石及其死不悔改的死党采取严肃态度，提高革命警惕，如果不对于反革命的国民党及其帝国主义人采取严肃态度，抛弃任何幻想，那么中国人民就不能得到和平，不能得到民主和独立。二十二年血的教训摆在我们的面前，让我们用这些教训来武装我们的头脑，来作为我们的指路明灯吧！
