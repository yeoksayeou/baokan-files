Experience in Reforming Naughty Children
　　Worker's Son Li Yuan Has Been Reformed
　　Zhang Yiguang
　　Li Yuan is a student in Class A of the Second Grade at Shijiazhuang City's Third Primary School. He is fourteen years old this year, but because he is tall, he looks like he is fifteen or sixteen. He has a bit of a stutter, but he likes to say strange things, often stirring up small troubles. He doesn't study hard himself and doesn't want others to study well either. In class, he makes faces, pulls ears, and is always trying to provoke the teacher. After class, if classmates criticize him, he relies on his strength and starts fighting, sometimes even damaging other people's things. The class order is very difficult to maintain because of him. Classmates all hate him, and no one likes to hear the name Li Yuan. The teachers also find him to be a difficult problem. After I took over as the homeroom teacher of Class Two A, in order to put the whole class's learning and life on track, I first started to reform him.

　　At first, I widely collected materials about Li Yuan from teachers and classmates. I learned that when he first entered the school, although he was naughty, he could still listen to the teacher. Later, because the teacher relaxed his education and made excessive demands, there was more criticism than encouragement, which made him often feel wronged. From a home visit, I also learned that his father was of worker origin and is now the deputy street chief, and his mother is a female worker. Because they are busy with work, they don't have time to care for the child. Li Yuan goes out to hang around as soon as he gets home from school, and his schoolwork is poor. His parents are eager for their child to improve, so they inevitably scold him often. Therefore, Li Yuan not only does not feel happy at school, but also does not feel warmth at home. The mental oppression has formed a rebellious mood, which has gradually developed into troublemaking and even beating and scolding younger classmates.

　　Based on the above situation, I decided to combine efforts with his family to reform him. First of all, I tried my best to find ways to approach him. For the first few days, he didn't say anything when I asked him something. After I cared for him in daily life, he gradually moved closer to me, initially changing his previous misunderstanding of teachers. From one or two conversations, I found him to be frank, sincere, and intelligent. In order to help the children of workers, I was determined to reform him into a model student in the class. I told the children's cadres to help him more and change their past attitude towards him so that he would not feel special and isolated in the class. At the same time, I also agreed with his family that they should no longer scold him in the future. If he received praise at school, the family should also encourage him. In this way, Li Yuan gradually became more lively and cheerful in spirit. Then, a learning competition was launched in the school. I wanted him to strive to be a model and lead others. Every time I discovered his good points, I always praised him anytime and anywhere, and immediately told his parents. His parents also bought some things to reward him, so his learning enthusiasm rose day by day, and his shortcomings were gradually overcome. The classmates' impression of him also changed.

　　In order to prevent him from developing a tendency to be arrogant in the encouragement, I also carried out appropriate criticism, letting him consciously state his shortcomings. I wrote them down in a notebook and let him look at it every few days, asking him which ones had been corrected. Those that had been corrected were crossed out, further promoting his progress.

　　At the end of the competition, he was elected as a cadre of the class branch. Later, he further became a model of the class. Due to Li Yuan's rapid transformation, some other naughty children were also motivated to progress.

　　改造调皮儿童经验
  　工人子弟李元被改造过来了
    张毅光
    李元是石家庄市三完小二年级甲班的学生，今年十四岁，因为长的个儿高，看来好象十五六岁的人，有些口吃，却又好说怪话，常爱捣个小乱，自己不用功，也不愿别人好好学习。上课时，做鬼脸，扯耳朵，专和教员寻蹩扭。下课后，同学批评他，仗着自己有劲，动手就打，有时甚至毁坏别人的东西。班里秩序让他闹的很难维持。同学们都讨厌他，提起李元的名字，谁也不爱听，教员们对他也感到辣手。在我接任二甲级任后，为了使全班学习生活走入轨道，便首先着手改造他。
    开始，我广泛的从教师同学的说话中，搜集有关李元的材料。知道他在初入校时，虽然调皮，却还能听教师的话，后来，由于教师放松了对他的教育，又要求过高，对他批评多，鼓励少，使他时常感到委曲。又从家庭访问里，知道他父亲是工人出身，现任副街长，母亲是女工，因工作繁忙，对孩子没有时间关照。李元每天放学回家，就溜出去厮混，功课又差，家长希望孩子进步心切，对他便不免常常责骂。因此，李元在学校里既感不到愉快，在家庭又感不到温暖，精神上的压迫，形成了反抗的情绪，逐渐发展成为捣蛋调皮，甚至打骂小同学的举动。
    根据上述情况，决定与他家庭结合起来进行对他的改造。首先，我尽量设法接近他。头几天，问他什么总不作声，经我在日常生活上对他时时关心，他才逐渐向我靠近，初步改变了他以前对教师的误会。由一次二次的谈话里，我发现他坦白、诚挚、聪明，并为了帮助工人子弟，我决心要改造他成为班里的模范学生。我告诉儿童干部多帮助他，改变过去对他的态度，使他在班里不致感到特殊和孤立。同时，又和他家里约好，以后不要再责骂他，在学校得到表扬，家里也要鼓励。这样李元在精神上渐渐活泼愉快起来。接着，学校里展开学习竞赛，我要他争取模范，带动别人，每次发现他的好处，总是随时随地表扬，而且即时告诉他家长，家长也或多或少买了一些东西奖励他，从此，他的学习情绪日益高涨，缺点逐渐克服，同学们对他的印象也发生了变化。
    为了防止他在鼓励中产生自高自大的偏向，我也进行过适当的批评，让他自觉的说出缺点，我记在本子上，隔几天让他来看一次，问他那些改了，改掉的就划去，更促进了他的进步。
    竞赛结束，他当选了班分会的干部，后来，更进一步成了班的模范。由于李元的飞速转变，带动着其他的一些调皮儿童也随着进步了。
