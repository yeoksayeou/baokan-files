    This little girl is called Yufeng, and she's good friends with Jingui. She ran into the yard calling "Sister-in-law Jingui." Li Cheng's mother felt something was wrong again when she heard Jingui was called to a meeting, muttering, "Meetings every day! You'll end up eating 'meetings' for the rest of your lives!"

    Although Yufeng was only thirteen, she was clever and quick-witted. She calmly said to Li Cheng's mother, "Auntie! Don't you know what the meeting is about today?"

    "Why should I care?" Li Cheng's mother had just scolded Jingui, and her mood hadn't improved.

    Yufeng said, "I heard it's about discussing your family's land!"

    "What's there to discuss?"

    "I heard that the land you were allocated was picked by Li Cheng himself, and the villagers don't agree."

    "Who said that? Forty or fifty appraisers allocated the land to me at the general meeting. Everyone in the village knows that! Picked…." Yufeng was originally teasing Li Cheng's mother, but Li Cheng's mother took it seriously.

    Li Cheng's mother took it seriously, but Yufeng laughed. She said, "Auntie! Didn't you say meetings are useless? Hahaha…"

    Only then did Li Cheng's mother realize that Yufeng was teasing her. She couldn't help but laugh as she pointed at Yufeng and said, "You little troublemaker!"

    Jingui dragged the box from under the bed, preparing to move it onto the bed. Yufeng called out as she entered. She was only focused on listening to Yufeng's banter with her mother-in-law, so she stopped and stood up. When her mother-in-law and Yufeng both laughed, she couldn't help but join them with a laugh. After laughing, she bent down again to move the box.

    Li Cheng's mother's anger had subsided by this point. Looking back, she saw that without that broken box on the head of the bed, it was indeed much wider and more impressive. Therefore, as Jingui bent down to move the box, she changed her mind again: "No need to move it up. Go to your meeting!"

    Seeing that her mother-in-law's anger had subsided, Jingui naturally didn't want to move the thing up again. She agreed with an "Okay," and pushed it back under the bed. Then, she swept the dust off the area on the bed where the box had been. As she swept, she asked Yufeng, "Who came from the district?"

    Yufeng said, "Don't you know? Li Cheng is back."

    "You're lying again!"

    "Really! Didn't he come home?"

    Just then, Li Cheng's older sister, Xiao'e, walked in. After exchanging greetings, Jingui asked, "Didn't my brother-in-law come?"

    Xiao'e said, "He came! He went to the village office for a meeting! - Why didn't you go to the meeting?"

    Jingui grabbed Yufeng's arm and pretended to hit her head with a fist, asking, "Didn't you say my Li Cheng was back?"

    Yufeng shrunk her neck, laughed, and said, "You'd be quick to go if I mentioned him!"

    "You little troublemaker!" Jingui gently tapped Yufeng's back with her fist and let go. Turning to Xiao'e, she said, "Sister! I have to go to a meeting. I can't take care of you! You and Mom rest and make your own food!" Xiao'e also said, "Okay! You go ahead!" Li Cheng's mother wanted to talk about her troubles with Xiao'e, so she wanted to send Jingui away anyway, and said, "Go! Your sister isn't a stranger!" Jingui left with Yufeng. Now only the mother and daughter were left at home.

    Xiao'e said, "Mom! I haven't been able to come see you all winter! Are you well?"

    "Well? I'm suffering!"

    "I think you're much better than last year: you have new mattresses and blankets on the bed! Your clothes are neat and clean, and you have a wife…"

    Li Cheng's mother's troubles had been brewing for a long time, and Xiao'e's words opened the floodgates. She stretched her lower lip long and grunted, "Don't mention the wife, it makes me angry: the old saying goes: 'Marrying a wife is like adopting out a son' (this is a local saying). The wife is capable, and the child is capable, who still considers the mother as a person!" As she spoke, a few tears fell. After wiping her tears, she continued, "She's got everything under her control: she manages everything inside and out. When something big happens, she runs to the district to find her man. Whatever the two of them discuss is what happens, and they don't even tell us. Everything she does is right! Before we even ask a question, she says 'You don't understand!' When outsiders come, they only look for her! Who remembers that there's a me? Alas! Xiao'e! What kind of person do you think I'm living like? - Talking about my troubles is endless. You should make food first! I'll slowly tell you while you're cooking!"

    Xiao'e said, "I'll make it later, I'm not hungry yet!"

    "Make it first! Her brother-in-law will want to eat when he gets back!"

    Xiao'e didn't refuse and started cooking while still talking to her mother. She said, "Her brother-in-law often praises Jingui in his speeches to the women in our town, saying she's a model worker and everyone should learn from her. He doesn't mention her shortcomings. According to what you're saying, even though she's a good worker, she shouldn't disrespect the elderly, right?"

    Li Cheng's mother stretched her lower lip even longer and grunted, "What good work? Men have men's work, and women have women's work. Her work, as I see it, is like a dog catching mice, meddling in other people's business! She's been married for a year, how many times has she picked up a needle? How many threads has she spun?"

    Xiao'e said with a smile, "I see that they're eating and wearing well!"

    Li Cheng's mother stretched her lower lip even longer and said, "Who wouldn't flaunt their wealth? I used to not be able to eat even half a kilogram of oil a year, but after she came, it's half a kilogram a month; I used to feel bad about buying a needle from the peddler, but she goes to the shoe store in the market to buy shoes and the tailor shop to make uniforms, dressing very fashionably." The old woman was getting angry as she spoke, and her voice rose higher and higher: "Shameless! A woman going to the market to buy clothes! Aren't you afraid of being ridiculed (also a local saying, meaning aren't you afraid of people pointing at her back and laughing at her)..." Seeing that her mother was getting angry, Xiao'e quickly tried to persuade her, poured her a bowl of water to soothe her throat, and interrupted her with many other words.

    Xiao'e was very perceptive. Seeing that her mother was so dissatisfied with Jingui, she didn't mention Jingui again, but instead talked about her own household affairs from the winter to pass the time. But women's affairs are always related to other women, so no matter what Xiao'e talked about, her mother could always relate it to Jingui. For example, when Xiao'e mentioned the mutual aid group, her mother said, "Without the mutual aid group, Jingui would go out less often"; when Xiao'e mentioned the cooperative, her mother said, "Without the cooperative, Jingui would spend less money"; Xiao'e said that it was convenient to live in town, and her mother said that the convenience of the town was what spoiled Jingui; Xiao'e said that her husband was a cadre, and her mother said that it was because Li Cheng was a cadre that his wife was spoiled.

    Seeing that her mother's words couldn't escape Jingui, Xiao'e tried her best to choose words that her mother liked to hear. She knew that her mother liked to do needlework and spin cotton, so she boasted to her mother about her achievements in needlework and spinning cotton all winter. She said that she had spun twelve and a half kilograms of thread for the cooperative, sewn four pairs of thousand-layer soles for the shoe store, and sewed buttons for uniforms at the tailor shop for half a month. When she talked about the shoe store and the tailor shop, she was afraid that her mother would mention Jingui making uniforms and buying shoes again, but she had already started and had to continue. Her mother, because she only wanted to be satisfied with her daughter's achievements, didn't interrupt her to mention Jingui again, but at the end, she still couldn't help but connect it to Jingui. She said, "Look at my Xiao'e! If that Jingui thing could compare to even a fraction of my Xiao'e, I wouldn't have said anything! Who has she spun a thread for? Who has she done a stitch of work for?" Because her anger rose again, her voice rose very high, and she didn't even hear the footsteps outside the door. Just as she finished speaking, Jingui lifted the curtain and came in, and Xiao'e's husband followed behind.

  　（二）
    这小女孩叫玉凤，和金桂很好。她在院里叫着“金桂嫂”就跑进来。李成娘一听说叫金桂去开会觉着又有点不对头，嘴里嘟噜着说：“天天开会！以后就叫你们把‘开会’吃上！”
    玉凤虽说才十三岁，心眼儿很多，说话又伶俐。她沉住气向李成娘说：“大娘！你还不知道今天开会干什么吗？”
    “我倒管他哩？”李成娘才教训过金桂，气色还没有转过来。
    玉凤说：“听说就是讨论你家的地！”
    “那有什么说头？”
    “听说你们分的地是李成哥自己挑的，村里人都不赞成。”
    “谁说的？四五十个评议员在大会上给我分的地，村里谁不知道？挑的…………”玉凤本来是逗李成娘，李成娘却当了真。
    李成娘认了真，玉凤却笑了。他说：“大娘！你不是说开会不抵事吗？哈哈哈……”
    李成娘这时才知道玉凤是逗她，自己也忍不住一边笑，一边指着玉凤说：“你这个小捣乱鬼！”
    金桂把箱子从床下拖出来正预备往床上搬，玉凤就叫着进来了。她只顾听玉凤跟自己的婆婆倒蛋，也就停住了手站起来，等到自己的婆婆跟玉凤都笑了，自己也忍不住陪着她们笑了一声，笑罢了仍旧弯下腰去搬箱子。
    李成娘这一会气已经消下去，回头看见床头上没有那口破箱子，的确比放上那口破箱子宽大得多，也排场得多，因此当金桂正弯腰去搬箱子的时候，她又变了主意：“不用往上搬了，你去开你的会吧！”
    金桂见婆婆的气已经消了，自然也不愿意再把那东西搬起来，就答应了一声“也好”，仍然把它推回床下去，然后又把床上放箱子的地方的灰尘扫了一下。她一边扫，一边问玉凤：“区上谁来了？”
    玉凤说：“你还不知道？李成哥回来了。”
    “你又说瞎话！”
    “真的！他没有回家来吗？”
    正说着，李成的姐姐小娥就走进来，大家说了几句见面话以后，金桂问：“我姐夫没有来？”
    小娥说：“来了！到村公所开会去了！——你怎么没有去开会？”
    金桂抓住玉凤一条胳膊又用一个拳头向她头上虚张声势地问她：“你不是说是你李成哥回来了？”
    玉凤缩住脖子笑着说：“一提他你去得不快点！”
    “你这个小捣乱鬼！”金桂轻轻在玉凤脊背上用拳头按了一下放了手，回头跟小娥说：“姐姐！我要去开会，顾不上招呼你！你歇一歇跟娘两个人自己做饭吃吧！”小娥也说“好！你快去吧！”李成娘为了跟小娥说起心病话来方便，本来就想把金桂推走，因此也说：“你去吧！你姐姐又不是什么生客！”金桂便跟玉凤走了。这时家里只留下她们母女两个。
    小娥说：“娘！我一冬天也顾不上来看你一眼！你还好吧！”
    “好什么？活受啦吧！”
    “我看比去年好得多：床上也有了新褥新被了！衣裳也整齐干净了，也有媳妇了……”
    李成娘的心病话早就闷不住了，小娥这一下就给她引开了口。她把下嘴唇伸得长长地哼了一声说：“不提媳妇不生气：古话说：‘娶个媳妇过继出个儿’（这是当地流行的一句俗话），媳妇也有本事，孩子也有本事，谁还把娘当个人啦！”说着还落了几点老泪。她擦过泪又接着说：“人家一手遮天了：里里外外都由人家管，遇了大事人家会跑到区上去找人家的汉。人家两个人商量成什么是什么，大小事不跟咱通个风。人家办成什么都对！咱还没有问一句，人家就说‘你摸不着！’外边人来，谁也是光找人家！谁还记得有个咱？唉！小娥！你看娘还活得象个什么人啦？——说起心病话来没个完。你还是先做饭吧！做着饭娘再慢慢告诉你！”
    小娥说：“一会再做吧，我还不饿哩！”
    “先做着吧！一会他姐夫回来也要吃！”
    小娥也不再推，一边动手做饭，一边仍跟娘谈话。她说：“他姐夫给我们镇上的妇女讲话，常常表扬人家金桂，说她是劳动模范，要大家向她学习，就没有提到她的缺点。照娘这么说起来，虽说她劳动很好，可也不该不尊重老人啊？”
    李成娘又把她那下嘴唇伸得长长地哼了一声说：“什么好劳动？男人有男人的活，女人有女人的活。她那劳动呀，叫我看来是狗捉老鼠，多管闲事！娶过她一年了，她拈过几回针？纺过几条线？”
    小娥笑着说：“我看人家也吃上了，也穿上了！”
    李成娘把下嘴唇伸得更长了一些说“破上钱谁不会耍派头？从前我一年吃不上一斤油，人家来了以后是一月一斤；我在货郎担上买个针也心疼得不得了，人家到集上去鞋铺里买鞋，裁缝铺里做制服，打扮得很时兴。”这老人家，说着就带了气，嗓子越提越高：“不嫌败兴！一个女人家到集上买着穿！不怕别人划她的脊梁筋（也是当地的俗话，意思是说不怕别人指着她的脊背笑话她）……”小娥见她动了气，赶紧劝她，又给她倒了碗水叫她润一润喉咙，又用好多别的话才算把她的话插断。
    小娥很透脱，见娘对金桂这样不满意，再也不提金桂的事，却说着自己一冬天的家务事来消磨时间。可是女人家的事情，总与别的女人家有关系，因此小娥不论说起什么来，她娘都能和金桂的事往一处凑。比方小娥说到互助组，她娘就说“没有互助组来金桂也能往外少跑几趟”；小娥提到合作社，她娘就说“没有合作社来金杜总能少花几个钱”；小娥说自己住在镇上很方便，她娘说就是镇上的方便才把金桂引诱坏了的；小娥说自己的男人当干部，她娘说就是李成当干部才把媳妇娇惯了的。
    小娥见娘的话左右摆不脱金桂，就费尽心思检娘爱听的话。她知道娘一辈爱做针线活，爱纺绵花，就把自己年头一冬天做针线活跟纺绵的成绩在娘面前夸一夸。她说她给合作社纺了二十五斤线，给鞋铺纳了八对千针底，给裁缝铺定了半个月制服扣子。他说到鞋铺和裁缝铺，还生怕娘再提起金桂做制服和买鞋的事来，可是已经说开头了不得不说下去。她娘呢，因为只愿满意女儿的功劳，倒也没有打断女儿的话再提金桂的事，不过听到末了，仍未免又跟金桂连起来。她说：“看我小娥！金桂那东西能抵住我小娥一分的话，我也没有说的！她给谁纺过一截线？给谁做过一针活？”她因为气又上来了，声音提得很高，连门外的脚步声也没听见，赶到话才落音，金桂就揭着门帘进来了，小娥的丈夫也跟在后面。
