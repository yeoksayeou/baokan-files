【Ping City News】Since the 14th District of Chaowai in this city began collecting this year's spring business tax on the 16th, many shops have truthfully reported their business and income and expenditure. However, many merchants are still fabricating false accounts, hoping to evade taxes. After careful investigation and verification by our working cadres, it was found that: Zhenxing Wood Factory privately collected 18,000 yuan in business tax in March and April; Chunmao Wood Factory privately collected 33,000 yuan in business tax in March and April; Dongsheng Wood Factory embezzled 10,565 yuan in business tax in March; Juxing Grain Store underreported income of 100,000 yuan; Anli Pig and Sheep Intestine Factory outside Dongbianmen declared that it started business on April 1st, but it actually started business in March and had an income of 210,000 yuan. For this reason, on the 24th, a general meeting of merchants in the district was held at Girls' No. 4 Middle School, attended by more than 200 managers of various shops. First, the chief of the Finance Section of the Ping City People's Government explained the current victorious situation and the industrial and commercial policies of the People's Government, and emphasized that paying taxes is the duty of citizens, and that the People's Government's tax collection is different from that of the Kuomintang bandit gang, because it is to develop production and is taken from the people and used for the people. Finally, the facts of the above-mentioned merchants' underreporting and violation of national tax laws were announced, and the government's attitude towards this matter was stated: Except for Zhenxing and Chunmao, which violated national tax laws and need to be submitted to the Municipal Bureau for approval, the other underreporting households will not be punished, and are allowed to rereport truthfully. After the announcement, the merchants applied for rereporting one after another, scrambling to obtain declaration forms from the tax bureau staff. More than 90 copies were issued in three minutes.

　　平市十四区征收营业税中
  　发现商户隐瞒收入
    经过教育现已纷纷重报
    【平市讯】本市朝外十四区自十六日开始征收本年春季营业税以来，各商店对本商号之业务、收支实报者很多，但仍有不少商家捏造假帐，希图逃避税收。经我工作干部周密调查证实者，计有振兴木厂三、四月份私征行商税一万八千元，春茂木厂三、四月份私征行商税三万三千元，东升木厂三月份私吞行商税一万零五百六十五元，聚兴粮栈少报收入流水十万元，东便门外安利猪羊肠厂申报是自四月一日开始营业，其实三月份已营业，并收入二十一万元。为此，二十四日又在女四中学召开该区商家全体大会，到会有各商家经理二百余名。曾先由平市人民政府财政科长说明目前胜利形势，及人民政府的工商业政策，并着重说明纳税是国民应尽的义务，且人民政府征税与国民党匪帮不同，乃是为了发展生产，是取之于民用之于民。最后宣布了上述各商家漏报及违犯国家税收法令的事实，并对此事表明政府态度称：除振兴、春茂两家违犯国家税收法令，须呈请市局批示外，其余少报户，一律不用处罚办法，允许重新据实申报。宣布后，各商户纷纷申请重报，争向税务局人员索取申报表。三分钟就发出九十余份。    　　（李振鲁、王仲儒）
