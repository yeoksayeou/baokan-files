Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, April 27th: The Prague Peace Congress continued on the morning of the 25th (sixth day). Li Dequan, Vice-Chairman of the Democratic Women's Federation of the Chinese delegation, as well as representatives from Indonesia, Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Poland, and the United States, delivered speeches. As the morning session was about to conclude, Simonov delivered a speech to the congress. The Soviet writer's speech was repeatedly interrupted by applause. Simonov said: We, the Soviet people, sincerely desire peace. However, those warmongers who believe that we desire peace because we are weak are making a serious and dangerous mistake. We desire peace because we know the pain and poverty that war brings to all people. In stark contrast to the warmongers, we think primarily and foremost of the fate of the people, the interests of the people, not only the interests of our own people, but also the interests of all peoples of the world. This is why we are so resolutely opposed to war and so bravely fight for peace. This is why, no matter how aware we are of our strength, no matter how calmly and confidently we face any test in obtaining victory, we still want peace and only peace. Warmongers today are striving to act according to the ancient pirate-like principle of "divide and rule." They first want to divide the people and then rule them, that is, provoke them to fight each other. However, it is not so easy to divide us, the people of the world. We are laborers, we have the strong hands of laborers, and when we reach out to each other for friendship and peace, our clasped hands are so strong that the warmongers cannot now and will never be able to separate our hands, because we are united in the struggle for peace, because we cannot be divided, because the warmongers are too weak to divide us. Therefore, it will be peace, not war, that rules the world, and things will be as we wish, not as they wish. Simonov concluded: Our World Peace Congress is a victory for us in the struggle against the warmongers. However, this is only the first victory and the first step taken. We must be able to make the warmongers constantly feel our growing and irresistible resistance to their war plans. And, without a doubt, we must do this with united efforts.

　　布拉格和平大会第六日
  　苏代表痛斥战贩
    【新华社北平二十七日电】布拉格讯：布拉格和平大会于二十五日（第六日）上午继续举行。中国代表团代表民主妇联副主席李德全以及印尼、保、捷、波、美各国代表均发表演说。在上午会议将结束时，西蒙诺夫在大会上作了演说。这位苏联作家的讲演不断为掌声所打断。西蒙诺夫说：我们苏联人民非常希望和平。然而，那些以为我们希望和平是因为我们软弱的战争贩子们是犯了严重而危险的错误。我们希望和平，因为我们知道战争给一切人民带来何等的痛苦与贫困。与战争贩子完全相反，我们是主要地而且首先地想到人民的命运，人民的利益，不仅是我国人民的利益，而且是全世界各国人民的利益。这就是为什么我们那样坚决不渝地不要战争，而且那样勇猛地为和平而斗争。这就是为什么不管我们怎样认识到我们有力量，不管在何种考验面前，对获取胜利是怎样镇定而满怀信心，我们仍然要和平而且只要和平，战争贩子今天正力求依照古老的海盗式的“分而治之”的原则来行动。他们首先要分裂人民而后统治他们，这就是说挑拨他们互相战争。然而，要分裂我们全世界的老百姓并不是那么轻而易举的。我们是劳动者，我们有劳动者的强有力的手，当我们互相伸出手争取友谊、争取和平时，我们紧握着的手是如此地有力，以至战争贩子现在不能、将来也永远不能使我们的手分开，因为我们是团结在争取和平的斗争中，因为我们不可能被分裂，因为战争贩子是弱得分裂不了我们。因此统治世界的就将是和平而不是战争，一切事情就将是如我们所希望的那样，而不是如他们所希望的那样。西蒙诺夫结语说：我们的世界拥护和平大会是我们在反对战争贩子的斗争中的胜利。然而这仅是第一个胜利和所作的第一步。我们务须能够使战争贩子经常感受到我们对他们战争计划的日益增长的不可抵卸的反抗。而且，无疑问地，我们一定要用团结的努力来进行这件事。
