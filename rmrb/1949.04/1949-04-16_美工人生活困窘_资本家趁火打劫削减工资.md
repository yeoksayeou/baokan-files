Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 14th: TASS, New York - The economic situation of American workers is constantly deteriorating. Employed workers are already in dire straits; if they do not agree to the capitalists' wage cuts, they will lose their jobs. The US Department of Labor's Monthly Labor Review estimates that from August 15, 1945, to January 15, 1949, general prices rose by 41 percent, while wages increased by only 22 percent. Therefore, when new collective agreements are concluded in major industries this month, a broad segment of the working masses is demanding wage increases, but some right-wing senior union leaders who defend the interests of the capitalists are openly rejecting this demand. As a result, in secondary industrial sectors, many new contracts do not stipulate wage increases, and only a few contracts vaguely guarantee the right to negotiate wages after July 15. However, the Farm Equipment Workers Union, the Fur Workers Union, the West Coast Longshoremen's Union, the Electrical, Radio and Machine Workers Union, and the United Mine Workers of America have now all put forward specific demands for wage increases.

In the face of sluggish product sales, capitalists, having foreseen the inevitable decline in industrial product prices, are taking the opportunity to "lower" prices to resist workers' demands. According to a contract signed last year between General Motors and its workers, wages and prices are mutually influenced; if prices fall, wages are reduced. Inland Steel has already reduced the price of rails by six dollars per ton, and other steel companies are expected to announce price reductions for some steel products. The Associated Press frankly admits that the purpose of reducing steel prices is to resist workers' demands for wage increases. The Commercial Daily reveals that the automobile companies' price cuts are not only intended to thwart workers' demands for wage increases, but also to undermine demands for the establishment of medical relief funds. Ford is even preparing to cut workers' wages by two cents per hour to resist these demands.

### 美工人生活困窘　资本家趁火打劫削减工资

　　美工人生活困窘
  　资本家趁火打劫削减工资
    【新华社北平十四日电】塔斯社纽约讯：美国工人的经济情况正在不断恶化中。在业工人已处于这种困窘的境地，如果他们不同意资本家减低工资，就要失业。美国劳工部的劳工评论月刊估计：一九四五年八月十五日到一九四九年一月十五日，一般物价上涨百分之四十一，而工资仅仅增加了百分之二十二。因此，在本月大工业缔结新的集体合同时，劳动群众的广大阶层都要求增加工资，但是一些维护资本家利益的右翼高级工会领导人物，却公开拒绝这种要求。结果在第二等的工业部门中，许多新合同都没有规定增加工资，只有很少的合同含糊地规定保证在七月十五日以后对工资的谈判权。不过，收割机制造工人工会，皮毛工人工会，西岸码头工人工会，电器与无线电器材工人工会和煤矿工人联合会现在都提出了增加工资的具体要求。
    资本家在产品滞销的情况下，本已预见工业品物价跌落的不可避免，就趁势“降低”价格，以抵抗工人的要求。按去年通用汽车公司与工人订过一个合同，规定工资与物价相互影响，物价跌，则工资减。内陆钢业公司的铁轨每吨已减六美元，预料其他钢铁公司也将宣布一些钢产品的减价。美联社坦率承认：减低钢价的目的是抵抗工人增加工资的要求。商务日报透露汽车公司的减价，不只企图打击工人增加工资的要求，而且要破坏成立医药救济基金的要求。福特公司并准备每小时削减工人工资二分美金，以抵制工人的这种要求。
