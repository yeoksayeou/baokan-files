　　Farms Are Not for Organ Production
  　Regulations on Farm Tasks in the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Area
    [Hebei-Shandong-Henan Dispatch, 15th] On March 20th, the Agricultural Department of the Hebei-Shandong-Henan Administrative Office convened a joint meeting of the agricultural section chiefs and farm managers of the subordinate second, third, fourth, fifth, and seventh special districts and counties. The meeting corrected the purely operational viewpoint in farms, as well as the idea of regarding farms as organ production or engaging in small-scale operations. It clarified the understanding that farms are specialized agricultural technology organizations that gradually improve farmers' production technology to achieve the goal of increased production. The Administrative Office stipulated the tasks and specific working guidelines for farms at all levels at the meeting. Regarding the tasks of county promotion farms (i.e., farms), they mainly include: A. Massively propagate superior varieties and ensure that they are free of counterfeits, inferior quality, and impurities to maintain the quality of the superior varieties and prevent degeneration. B. Conduct acclimatization experiments. C. Systematically promote superior varieties, organize the masses to systematically select seeds and exchange seeds with each other, promote effective methods for preventing and controlling pests, good cultivation methods, and methods for accumulating and applying fertilizer, etc. D. Regularly absorb the production experience of the masses and collect superior varieties. To this end, in addition to first taking the lead in demonstrating the role of intensive cultivation to harvest more grain within the farm, agricultural technology publicity should be carried out through symposiums, exhibitions, and general mass meetings. At the same time, typical demonstrations should be conducted through specially invited farmers to lay the foundation for promotion, and technical research associations should be organized around key villages to guide the masses to improve agricultural technology. The special district promotion station (farm) mainly provides regular technical guidance to county farms and is responsible for the promotion of the entire district. The Administrative Office's agricultural experimental farm, in addition to specialized experiments, research, and promotion, also trains agricultural technicians. Finally, each promotion farm made work plans for April and May, mainly to carry out acclimatization experiments and propagate superior varieties in preparation for the large-scale promotion of 811 millet and "S" cotton next year.

　　农场不是机关生产
  　冀鲁豫规定农场任务
    【冀鲁豫十五日电】三月二十日冀鲁豫区行政公署农业处召开所属二、三、四、五、七等专、县农业科长及农场场长联席会议，纠正了农场中单纯经营观点，和把农场看成是机关生产或过小日子的想法，明确认识农场是农业技术的专门组织，使农民生产技术逐渐提高，达到增产目的。行署于会议上规定了各级农场任务和具体工作方针。关于县推广场（亦即农场）的任务，主要是：甲、大量繁殖优良品种，并做到去伪、去劣、去杂，以保持良种不使退化。乙、进行风土试验。丙、有计划地推广优良品种，组织群众有计划地选种与互相换种，推广防除害虫的有效方法，好的耕作方法，积肥及施肥方法等。丁、经常吸收群众的生产经验，搜集优良品种。为此，除场内先以精耕细作多收粮食起带头作示范作用外，并应采用座谈会、展览会、一般群众会等方式，进行农业技术的宣传，同时通过特约农户进行典型示范，奠定推广基础，并在重点村周围组织技术研究会，领导群众提高农业技术。专署推广站（农场）主要是对各县场经常的技术指导，负责全区推广事业。行署农业试验场，除专门试验、研究与推广外，并附带训练农业技术人员。最后各推广场作了四、五两月份的工作计划，主要先进行风土试验和繁殖优良品种，以备明年大量推广八一一谷和斯字棉等。
