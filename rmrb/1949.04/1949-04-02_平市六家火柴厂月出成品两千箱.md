[Our Newspaper Despatch] There are seven match factories in this city. Except for Huaxing, which was destroyed by the Kuomintang bandit troops, the other six resumed work shortly after liberation. Because of brisk sales of finished products and stable wages, the lives of workers are guaranteed. Now the output of each factory is increasing day by day. In March, the total output of the six factories reached 2,000 cases. Housheng Match Company resumed work the earliest (February 3rd). Initially, it only produced ten cases per day. After the "February 7th" Workers' Congress, the workers of the factory were greatly encouraged. On the one hand, they organized a children's labor club, and on the other hand, they put forward the slogan of increasing production. By February 10th, the daily output had increased to fifteen cases. From March 1st, the daily production reached twenty cases. Danhua Match Company was founded in the thirty-first year of Guangxu (1905), and it is the largest in scale, with eighty-eight machines of various types. The annual output once reached 50,000 cases. Later, due to the poor internal system of the factory, the number of idle employees gradually increased, and the oppression and exploitation of workers became too severe. It also suffered from the blows of the puppet legal tender and puppet gold yuan notes, and its business gradually declined. The factory resumed work on March 1st, producing ten cases per day, which is equal to the output during the siege period before liberation. Half a month later, thanks to the workers' active efforts to increase production, it has been increasing day by day. As of now, it can produce twenty-five cases per day. The other four companies, Yongli, Sanyang, Nanyang, and Yanjing, can produce three to seven cases per day each day. The six match factories in Beiping have a total of 140 machines, including splint arranging machines, splint aligning machines, splint cutting machines, oil dipping machines, chemical dipping machines, splint disordering machines, splint unloading machines, and box pasting machines. The finished products were once sold to Shaanxi, Qinghai, Xinjiang, and Mongolia. Since liberation, the factory owners have seen the prosperity of industry in the liberated areas and have increased their confidence. They believe that under the principle of labor-capital mutual benefit, there is great development ahead.

　　平市六家火柴厂月出成品两千箱
    【本报讯】本市火柴工厂共有七家，除华兴一家遭国民党匪军破坏外，其余六家均于解放后不久即告复工。因成品畅销，工资稳定，工人生活获得保障，现各厂产量均日见增加，三月份六厂生产总量已达两千箱。厚生火柴公司复工最早（二月三日），最初每日仅出十箱，“二七”工人大会后，该厂工人受极大鼓励，一面组织了童工俱乐部，一面提出增加生产的口号，到二月十日，每日出产增至十五箱。从三月一日起，每日生产达到二十箱。丹华火柴公司创办于光绪三十一年，规模最大，拥有各种机器达八十八台，年产量曾达五万箱。后因厂内制度不良，闲散职员渐多，对工人压迫剥削得太厉害，又遭受伪法币伪金圆券的打击，营业逐渐衰落。该厂于三月一日复工，每日生产十箱，与解放前围城时期产量相等。半个月以后，由于工人积极增产，已逐日增加，截至现在止，能每日生产二十五箱。其他永利、三羊、南阳、燕京四家，每日均能生产三箱至七箱不等。北平六家火柴厂共拥有排梗机、顺梗机、切梗机、占油机、占药机、乱杆机、卸梗机、糊盒机一百四十台，成品曾远销陕西、青海、新疆、蒙古。解放以来，各火柴厂主见到解放区工业繁荣的情形，就增加了信心。相信在劳资两利的原则下，前途有极大的发展。
