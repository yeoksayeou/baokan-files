　　Textiles and Cotton Planting
　　Zhang Chong, Deputy Minister of Agriculture, North China People's Government

　　Since the liberation of Tianjin and Beijing, should we continue to promote and develop rural handicraft textile production? This question has sparked much debate. Similarly, increasing cotton production and promoting American cotton has raised concerns among some. With the cotton planting season approaching, we must have a clear and unified understanding of this issue. During the Anti-Japanese War, we advocated using domestically produced cloth to replace foreign cloth, implementing a self-reliance policy under enemy division and blockade, ensuring military and civilian needs, solving our difficulties, and launching a powerful counterattack against the enemy's economic blockade, even exporting to Chahar and Suiyuan. By 1948, the annual output of domestically produced cloth had reached 135 million square feet.

　　After the liberation of Tianjin and Beijing, we took over machine-powered textile mills with more than 400,000 spindles and over 10,000 looms, with an annual output of over four million bolts of cloth, which can supply most of the military and civilian needs of the entire North China region. This is a new situation, which brings with it a new question: we must restore and develop the production of foreign yarn and cloth in large cities and use every method to meet the raw material needs of modern machine industry. Today, the sideline textile industry in rural villages should be replaced, in a planned and step-by-step manner, by the progressive and modern machine textile industry. Our revolution is precisely for the development of productive forces. We must never waste millions of people to do what can be done well by only tens of thousands. In the past, under enemy blockade, we had no large cities or modern machine textile industry. Developing handicraft textiles to resist foreign goods was progressive and correct. But today, in this new situation, to exert all our strength to promote handicraft textiles is detrimental to the development of social productive forces. However, many places, when starting to make their 1949 production plans, still emphasized the development of rural handicraft textiles, even in mountainous areas with poor textile conditions and a weak foundation. It is said that the Taihang region spent a great deal of effort in changing this thinking of some comrades, which is clearly wrong. If we do not clearly see the new economic situation after the liberation of large cities, do not recognize the laws of economic development, and do not understand the principles of increasing productive forces, we will inevitably run into snags and cause losses to farmers and small handicraftsmen. Naturally, when replacing rural handicraft industry with large-scale machine industry, we must never use the violent and destructive methods used by old capitalist large production to replace small production, causing small producers to become unemployed and even poorer. Instead, we should lead small producers to change jobs in a planned and step-by-step manner, so that large production can develop according to the laws, and small producers can avoid losses during the transition. This is precisely the superiority of the New Democratic economy.

　　Currently, spring plowing has already begun in various places, and the shortage of rural labor and our promotion of cotton planting are excellent conditions for changing jobs. We should actively mobilize and organize this labor force to shift to agricultural production, especially planting industrial raw materials such as cotton and peanuts. In some places, we can also organize them to switch to other timely and localized sideline handicrafts, such as weaving reed mats and straw hats. These types of sidelines cannot yet be replaced by large-scale machine industry, and activities such as breeding livestock like cattle and sheep, and raising pigs and chickens, cannot be replaced by machine production at all. Moreover, due to the victory of the war and the smooth flow of trade, the expansion of sales will be even more beneficial to these sideline productions. Of course, in order to promote this transition, we must also manage the price policies for cloth and thread. On the one hand, we must gradually lower the profit of handicraft textiles below that of agriculture, especially below that of cotton planting, peanut planting, animal husbandry, and weaving, in order to stimulate their transition. On the other hand, we cannot compete with them with very cheap foreign thread and cloth, giving them two or three years to gradually transition in a planned way. This is how we differ from the bourgeoisie. We must conscientiously and responsibly lead this transition and organize this transition so that people who maintain part of their livelihood through handicraft textiles can maintain their livelihood by engaging in other productions during and after the transition, and even obtain more income.

　　To develop machine textile industry, we must increase the production of large quantities of cotton and improve the quality of cotton to suit the production of machine textiles.

　　Before the Anti-Japanese War, China's cotton production ranked third in the world, but due to the deformed development of the colonial textile industry and the huge needs of 450 million people, cotton production, although large, was still insufficient. In 1931, the country produced 7.5 million piculs of ginned cotton, while imports reached 5.6 million piculs, ranking first in population goods. At that time, due to the high price of cotton, farmers increased cotton planting, but soon they were subjected to the low-price purchases of imperialists and their lackeys, plus the looting by Japanese invaders and Kuomintang troops. Farmers repeatedly suffered great losses and were unwilling to plant more cotton. This past resistance of farmers was completely correct. In 1948, the North China Bureau had over 7.7 million mu of cotton fields, but due to poor harvests, only 170 million catties of ginned cotton were produced. However, this amount was still more than enough for the military and civilian needs of the North China Liberated Area at that time. But with the liberation of large cities such as Tianjin and Beijing by the People's Liberation Army, if over 400,000 spindles are fully operational, then this cotton will be insufficient again. Our vast rural areas must plant large quantities of cotton to supply the industrial raw materials needed by the people's cities. To this end, the North China People's Government's 1949 agricultural production plan requires planting 12 million mu of cotton, an increase of 60 percent in cotton fields, with each mu yielding 25 catties of ginned cotton, for a total of 300 million catties of ginned cotton, an increase of 130 million catties. This is an arduous task, and we must carry out in-depth propaganda and organizational work. To eliminate the historical doubts of farmers about "not being worth the effort," the North China Financial and Economic Committee stipulates that cotton can be used to pay public grain, with one catty of ginned cotton being equivalent to eight catties of public grain rice. If the actual market price exceeds this ratio, the trade company will purchase it at the market price. We should conduct extensive and in-depth propaganda work based on this provision to dispel farmers' doubts, explaining that due to the new changes in urban-rural relations, more cotton should be planted to supply the raw materials for the city's textile industry and exchange them for the industrial goods needed by farmers, and that the benefits of planting cotton are greater than those of general crops. In this way, we can inspire farmers to actively plant cotton.

　　Farmers still face many difficulties in expanding cotton planting and increasing income, such as the lack of seeds and fertilizers in newly planted areas. Cooperatives, production promotion societies, and trade companies should appropriately organize and regulate them. In particular, cotton planting requires more labor than general crops, and to increase yields, it is necessary to hoe four to eight times and prevent and control pests and diseases. We should effectively mobilize farmers to organize labor mutual aid, improve technology, mobilize the broad masses of women to participate in production, and timely transfer the labor force engaged in handicraft textiles to more profitable cotton planting production.

　　There is another extremely important issue in cotton planting, which is that future cotton planting is to solve the raw material problem of large-scale textile industry. Machine textiles require cotton with long and uniform fibers (cotton silk). These kinds of excellent varieties have been planted and promoted in some parts of North China in the past. During the Anti-Japanese War, farmers changed to planting local cotton suitable for handicraft ginning and spinning. Now that we want to replace handicraft textiles with machine textiles, we must replace local cotton with excellent cotton varieties. This change is not easy. For example, if Si Zi cotton 2B and 4B are planted properly, they can produce half to double the yield of local cotton, but farmers who are accustomed to planting local cotton must improve their farming methods (the People's Daily published articles introducing planting techniques by Tian Nong and Xi Fengzhou on March 19th and April 8th). In particular, this type of cotton is most prone to pests such as cotton aphids, and we must take effective measures and use effective insecticides and drugs to help farmers. At the same time, these cotton seeds are also prone to mixing and degradation, so we must always maintain pure varieties and regularly rotate and renew them. In order to promote excellent varieties, guide farmers in farming techniques, and effectively prevent and control cotton aphids and other pests, the Ministry of Agriculture has established a Cotton Production Improvement Office and set up guidance areas in various important cotton-producing areas. However, the complete increase in cotton production and the use of excellent varieties must rely on the active efforts of governments at all levels and rural workers in cotton-producing areas to be guaranteed.

　　Shanghai will soon be liberated, and that area has more than 2.3 million spindles, with textile workers accounting for a large proportion of all workers in Shanghai. We rely on the workers, so we must solve the workers' livelihood and ensure that large textile mills can operate. In the past, during the Kuomintang rule, the raw materials of the mills mostly relied on the import of American cotton. We must never be like the Kuomintang and rely on the United States for everything. We must mobilize and organize the broad masses of farmers to plant more cotton and plant excellent cotton varieties suitable for the needs of the mills. According to surveys, the vast plains of North China and the Central Plains are suitable for cotton planting. We must immediately start to increase cotton production. Guaranteeing the completion and exceeding the cotton planting plan in the North China region has great significance for the national cotton economy. It is not only to guarantee the raw materials for the North China textile mills, but also to supply the raw materials for the Shanghai textile mills in the soon-to-be-liberated Chinese cotton textile center. Governments at all levels and comrades working in rural areas of cotton-producing areas should fight to complete this arduous task.

　　纺织与植棉
    华北人民政府农业部副部长  张冲
    平津解放后，农村手工业纺织是否还应继续提倡发展？这问题曾引起许多人的争论；增加棉产推广美棉也曾使得有些人发生疑虑。植棉季节在即，对这个问题，我们必须有明确一致的认识。抗日战争期间，我们提倡用土布代替洋布，在敌人分割封锁下，实行自力更生的政策，保障了军需民用，解决了我们的困难，给敌人对我们的经济封锁以有力的回击，而且还输出察绥等地。到一九四八年，年产土布已达一万万三千五百万方尺。
    平津解放后，我们接收的机器纺织纱厂，有四十余万纱锭，织布机万余台，年产布四百余万匹，可供全华北区军需民用的大部。这是一个新的情况，随之也产生了一个新的问题，就是：必须恢复与发展大城市的洋纱洋布，用一切方法满足现代化机器工业的生产原料。在今天农村小手工业的副业纺织应该有计划有步骤地让位于进步的现代化的机器纺织工业。我们革命就是为的发展生产力，我们绝不能把几万人便可很好完成的生产，旷费几百万人去作，过去在敌人封锁下，我们没有大城市和现代机器纺织工业，发展手工业纺织，抵制外货是进步的正确的，但在今天新的情况下，再要用全力提倡手工业纺织，对社会生产力的发展是不利的。但是许多地方在开始做一九四九年的大生产计划时，还强调农村手工业纺织的发展，甚至纺织条件与基础较差的山区也仍要提倡。太行区在转变某些同志的这种思想上，据说还费了很大力量，显然这是错误的。如果我们不看清大城市解放后的新经济情况，不认识经济发展的规律，不了解提高生产力的道理，那就必然要碰钉子，使农民及小手工业者吃亏。自然，用大机器工业以代替农村小手工业，我们决不能象旧资本主义式的大生产代替小生产时那样，以狂暴的破坏方式，使小生产者陷于失业与更加贫困，而是有计划有步骤的领导小生产者转业，既使大生产遵循着规律得到发展，又使小生产者避免了转变过程中的损失，这正是新民主主义经济的优越性。
    目前各地春耕已经开始，农村劳动力的缺乏和我们提倡植棉，便是转业上的很好条件，应该积极的动员与组织这批劳动力转到农业生产，特别是种植棉花、花生等工业原料上去；有的地方还可以组织转入其他适时适地的副业手工业，如苇席、草帽辫等编织业上。这类副业在目前还不能被大机器工业所代替，而如繁殖牲畜牛、羊、养猪养鸡等则更是不能被机器生产所代替，而且因为战争的胜利，贸易的畅通，销路的扩大，对这些副业生产将更加有利。当然，为了促进这一转变，我们还要在布、线的价格政策等上掌握好，一方面使手工业纺织的利润逐渐的低于农业，特别是低于植棉，种花生与畜养编织等副业，以刺激其转业，另一方面不能以很便宜的洋线洋布与之竞争，给以二、三年的时间，以便有计划的逐步转业。这是我们不同于资产阶级的作法，必须认真负责地领导这一转变，组织这一转变，使以手工业纺织维持其一部生活的人，在转变过程中及转变以后，得以进行其他生产维持其生活，甚至得到更多的收入。
    发展机器工业的纺织，必须增产大量的棉花，并提高棉花的质量，以适用于机器纺织的生产。
    中国的棉产量，在抗日战争前，原居世界的第三位，但由于以前殖民地纺织业畸形的发展及四万万五千万人口的庞大需要，棉产虽多，仍不足用，一九三一年全国产皮棉七百五万市担，而输入竟达五百六十万市担之多，占人口货的首位，当时曾因棉价较高，农民植棉增加，但不久即被帝国主义及其走狗的低价征购，再加以日寇与国民党军的抢掠，农民屡屡遭到很大损失，因而不愿多种棉花，农民过去的这种抵抗，是完全正确的。一九四八年华北局棉田七百七十余万亩，因歉收只产皮棉一万万七千万斤，而这个数目，对当时华北解放区的军需民用还是绰绰有余的。但平津等大城市为人民解放军所解放，如四十余万纱锭完全开工，则这些棉花又感不足，我们广大农村必须大量植棉，供给人民城市工业以充足的原料，为此，华北人民政府一九四九年的农业生产计划，要求植棉一千二百万亩，即增加棉田百分之六十，每亩产量提高到二十五斤皮棉，共产皮棉三万万斤，即增产一万万三千万斤。这是一个艰巨的任务，必须进行深入的宣传与组织工作，为了消除农民历史上的“得不偿失”的疑虑，华北财经委员会规定棉花可以代交公粮，一斤皮棉折公粮米八斤，如实际市价超过比数时，由贸易公司按市价收购，我们应根据这一规定，进行广泛而深入的宣传工作，祛除农民的疑虑，说明由于城乡关系的新变化，要多种棉花以供给城市纺织工业的原料，并以此换取农民需要的工业品，而且种棉利益比一般作物利益更大，这样来启发农民积极种植棉花。
    在扩大植棉与增加收益上，农民还有许多困难，如新种的地方缺乏种籽、肥料等须要合作社、生产推进社、贸易公司适当的加以组织与调剂，特别是植棉比种一般作物费工，要增加产量，须要锄四至八遍，必需防除病虫为害，我们应很好的动员农民组织劳动互助，提高技术，动员广大妇女参加生产，并适时的把进行手工业纺织的劳动力转入更有利的植棉生产。
    植棉中还有一个极其重要的问题，就是今后植棉是为了解决大规模纺织工业的原料，机器纺织需要纤维（棉花丝）长而整齐的棉花，这类优良品种，华北有些地方过去曾种植过、推广过。在抗战期中，农民才又改种适合于手工业弹纺的本地棉，我们既要以机器纺织代替手工业纺织，就必须以优良棉种代替本地棉花。这一个改变并不是容易的事情，即如斯字棉２Ｂ、４Ｂ种植得法可比本地棉多产一半到一倍，但习惯于种本地棉的农民改种优良品种，必须很好的改良其耕作法，（三月十九日和四月八日人民日报曾刊载田农与席凤洲介绍种植的文章），特别是这类棉花最易发生棉蚜等灾害，我们必须进行有效的措施，用有效的杀虫办法及药品帮助农民，同时这些棉种又易混杂退化，必须经常保持纯种，定期轮换更新。为了推广优良品种，指导农民耕作技术及有效地防除棉蚜等灾害，农业部成立了棉产改进处，并在各重要产棉区设立指导区。但全部增产棉花与引用优良品种，必须依靠各级政府及产棉区农村工作人员的积极努力，才能得到保证。
    上海不久也将解放的那一带有二百三十余万纱锭，纱厂工人占全上海工人的很大比例，我们依靠工人就必须解决工人的生活，就必须保证大纱厂开工，而过去国民党统治时期纱厂原料多仰赖美棉的输入，我们决不应象国民党那样事事依赖美国，我们必须动员与组织广大农民多种棉花，种植适合于纱厂需要的优良棉种，据调查华北与中原广大平原地区适于植棉，我们必须立即着手增产棉花，华北区保证完成与超过植棉计划，具有全国性棉业经济上的重大意义，不但是为了保证华北纱厂的原料，而且还要供给行将解放的中国棉织中心上海纱厂的原料，各级政府及产棉区农村工作的同志们，应该为完成这一艰巨任务而斗争。
