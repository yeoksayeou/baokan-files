Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 11th: U.S. imperialism is increasingly intensifying its conspiratorial activities to annex China's territory, Taiwan Province. According to a report by the Associated Press from Nanjing on the 6th, T.D. Edgar, the U.S. Acting Consul General in Taipei, and others openly stated in talks with Kuomintang government officials that "Taiwan should be included in the U.S. defense system." At the same time, a handful of U.S. lackeys, under the name of the "Taiwan Re-Liberation League," have written to the United Nations requesting that the UN discuss the so-called "Taiwan issue," and openly opposed the New China News Agency's commentary on March 16th, which stated that the Chinese people must liberate Taiwan from the enslavement of the Kuomintang reactionaries and American imperialism. Regarding the true nature of this so-called "Taiwan independence movement," this agency has long exposed that it is nothing more than the activity of a handful of U.S. running dogs hired by the U.S. spy agencies. A certain Taiwan-籍 (native) Kuomintang Supervisory Committee member also admitted in a conversation on the 7th: "I have conducted on-the-spot investigations in Hong Kong and Tokyo, and although those Taiwanese who advocate independence, autonomy, and trusteeship claim to have ten organizations, in reality, there are less than thirty or forty people. The leaders, two brothers (referring to Liao Wenyi and Liao Wenkui), have both married foreign (American) women and receive subsidies from a certain foreign general." The so-called foreign general refers to MacArthur.

　　美帝阴谋吞并台湾
    【新华社北平十一日电】美帝国主义日益加紧其吞并中国领土台湾省的阴谋活动。据合众社南京六日消息披露：美国台北代总领事Ｔ·Ｄ爱德格尔等人在与国民党政府官员谈话时公开表示“台湾应包括在美国防御体系之内。”与此同时，美国的一小撮走狗已以“台湾再解放联盟”名义致书联合国要求联合国讨论所谓“台湾问题”。并公然提出反对三月十六日新华社评论中关于中国人民一定要把台湾从国民党反动派和美国帝国主义奴役下解放出来的声明。关于这个所谓“台湾独立运动”的真象，本社早经揭露，指出这是只不过是受雇于美国间谍机关的一小撮美国走狗的活动。某台籍国民党监察委员七日谈话中亦承认：“余曾实地调查香港，东京方面主张独立自治及托管之台人，虽对外称有十团体，实则不足三四十人，其首领兄弟二人（按即廖文毅、廖文奎），均娶外（美）妇，并受某外国将领津贴。”这里所谓某外国将领即指麦克阿瑟。
