　　The Ping City People's Government Enterprise Bureau convened a symposium yesterday (the 20th) with representatives from municipal enterprises and labor representatives to discuss how to increase production, transform the consumer city into a production city, formulate production plans for each unit, adjust organizational structures, and increase worker welfare. Participants included representatives from the Tram Company, Water Company, Public Bus Company, Qinghe Woolen Mill, Yanjing Paper Mill, Mentougou Coal Mine, Western Hills Mine, First and Second Soy Sauce Factories, Dabeiyao Factory, Chemical Pharmaceutical Factory, Ice Factory, Beihua Iron Factory, Glass Factory, Minsheng Factory and other units, totaling over ninety people. All representatives agreed that the formulation of production plans should follow the mass line, incorporating workers' opinions to ensure successful completion. At the same time, the issue of sales after production should be considered, aligning with market needs and the citizens' demands. Production standards should emphasize both quality and quantity, strictly prohibiting speculation and adulteration. Regarding organizational structures, everyone believed that direct production departments should remain intact, but past bureaucratic elements, unproductive staff, and those who oppressed workers must be dealt with separately. Older workers can be reassigned to lighter work, maintaining their original salaries without necessarily retaining their original positions. On the issue of wages, wages should be determined based on the workers' contributions to the production unit. Past unreasonable and unfair wages should be quickly rectified. Regarding worker welfare, it was decided that the Enterprise Bureau would liaise separately with the Health Bureau on medical care and with the Education Bureau on the issue of children of workers attending school.
    During the meeting, workers from the Qinghe Woolen Mill issued a production competition challenge, guaranteeing that all workers in the factory would not take a single needle or thread; all employees would not be late or leave early; finished products would be durable, extending their service life; waste products would be recycled, machines repaired, costs reduced, consumption reduced, and production figures guaranteed to increase. Workers from the Minsheng Factory responded to the challenge, saying: "In the past, fifteen workers produced two hundred catties of sesame oil per day, using eight hundred catties of coal. Now, thirteen workers can produce one thousand two hundred catties a day, using only six hundred catties of coal. In the future, we will further reduce raw materials and manpower." Workers from the Tram Company said: "Not only will we have a hundred trams running on May 1st, but we will maintain a hundred trams running for a long time to come." Workers from the First Soy Sauce Factory said: "Previously, forty-five people produced four thousand catties of soy sauce a day. Now, thirty-five people can produce six thousand catties a day." The Second Soy Sauce Factory, which produces soy sauce entirely by hand, produced 51,000 catties in the twenty days from the resumption of work on March 10th to the end of March. (Zhong)

　　平市召开企业座谈会讨论有关增产诸问题
    订生产计划要根据市场需要不合理的制度机构应予调整
    【本报讯】北平人民市政府企业局昨（二十）日召集市营各企业机构接管代表及职工代表开座谈会，讨论如何增加生产，将消费城市变成生产城市，制订各单位的生产计划，调整组织机构及增加工人福利等问题。参加者有电车公司、自来水公司、公共汽车公司、清河制呢厂、燕京造纸厂、门头沟煤矿、西山矿、第一及第二酱油厂、大北窑厂、化学制药厂、制冰厂、北华铁工厂、玻璃厂、民生工厂等单位代表九十余人。各代表一致认为：订生产计划要走群众路线，吸收工人参加意见，才能保证顺利完成。同时要考虑生产后之销路问题，要根据市场上需要与市民接合起来，订生产标准要质量并重，严格制止投机取巧掺假。关于组织机构问题，大家认为直接生产部门原封不动，但过去的官僚派分子和不事生产的冗员和压迫工人的分子，一定要分别处理。年老的职工可以改作轻便的工作，原薪不必原职。关于工资问题，要根据工人在生产单位之贡献大少订定，过去不合理不公平之工资应迅速改正。关于工人福利，决定由企业局分别与卫生局联络医药，与教育局联络工人子弟入学问题。
    会中，清河制呢厂工人提出生产竞赛挑战，保证全厂工人不拿一针一线；全体职工不迟到、不早退；成品耐用，延长使用时间；改造废品，修理机器，减低成本，减少消耗，生产数字保证增多。民生工厂工人应战说：过去十五个工人一日出二百斤香油，用八百斤煤，现在十三个工人，一日就能出一千二百斤，只用六百斤煤。以后还要减少原料，减少人力。电车公司工人说：不但“五一”出车百辆，以后要长久维持百辆。第一酱油厂工人说：以前四十五个人一天出酱油四千斤，现在三十五个人一天可以出六千斤。完全用人工制酱油的第二酱油厂过去二十个工人一天出二千斤酱油，解放后，三月十日复工，到三月底二十天内出产了五万一千斤。（仲）
