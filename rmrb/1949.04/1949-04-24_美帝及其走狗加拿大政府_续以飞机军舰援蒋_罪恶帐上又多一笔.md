Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 23rd—American imperialism and its running dog, the Canadian government, are continuing to aid the Kuomintang reactionaries with airplanes, encouraging the Kuomintang reactionaries to continue their anti-people civil war and massacre of the Chinese people. According to a TASS dispatch from New York on the 21st, quoting a Chicago Tribune reporter, Simon, in a dispatch from Taiwan: Keelung, Taiwan's seaport, is filled with airplanes just shipped from the United States. In the past two weeks, more than 100 training aircraft and P-51 fighters have been shipped in. Investigations reveal that sixteen Canadian Mosquito bombers and another forty American-made aircraft have arrived in Taiwan since January 1. In other news, the United States recently gifted four destroyers to the Kuomintang government, of which the Taihe and Taicang arrived at Zuoying Port in Taiwan on the first of this month.
