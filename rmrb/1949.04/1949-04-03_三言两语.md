　　A Few Words
  　　Production Throughout the Year

　　"Production throughout the year" has been a fighting slogan for the people of the Taihang Mountains since the War of Resistance Against Japan. It broke the traditional habit of farmers' so-called "winter leisure," with production connecting in all four seasons, allowing the people to have ample food and clothing. Today's summary of winter production in the Taihang Mountains published in this newspaper is another glorious contribution of the people of the Taihang Mountains. This winter production movement directly prepared for this year's great production movement in action, not just in words, becoming the material foundation for realizing Chairman Mao's call to "increase production by an inch." With livestock, fertilizer, capital, and food, farmers have a guarantee for deep plowing, careful cultivation, and increased production. It should be pointed out that last winter's production was somewhat spontaneous in some areas. Some only issued the call for winter production at the end of December, and the time had already been missed. Some, although shouting about combining land reform, party rectification, and production, did not make any specific arrangements or inspections in practice, which brought many difficulties to this year's great production. Therefore, the Taihang experience is worth learning.

　　More on Production Leadership

　　The biggest problem currently existing in spring plowing is still the issue of leadership. Objectively, it is certainly due to the transfer of cadres, the lack of connection between work, and the lack of experience of new cadres, etc., but this precisely illustrates the necessity of strong and thorough leadership. According to a comrade in North China responsible for agricultural work, the current production plan is still stuck in the county in some areas and has not yet penetrated into the district or village. This should arouse everyone's vigilance. Don't think that having a plan means having everything. "All work lies in the village" was also a very good slogan in the past. Now we must go to the village to check and see if there is concrete leadership in production, if there are practical plans, and what specific arrangements have been made in terms of ideology, organization, etc., to complete this plan?

　　Promote Friendship and Mutual Assistance

　　The 42nd Detachment assisting the people in spring plowing, and the emancipated farmers of Huairou assisting their brothers in disaster areas in spring plowing production for self-salvation, is a lofty manifestation of class friendship of the people under the leadership of the Communist Party! All regions should greatly promote this, using all means to involve the people of the liberated areas in the great production movement, creating a wave of enthusiasm!

### 三言两语

　　三言两语
  　生产贯彻全年
    “生产贯彻全年”是抗战以来，太行山人民生产的一个战斗口号，它打破了农民所谓“冬闲”的传统习惯，一年四季生产互相衔接，人民得以丰衣足食。今日本报所发表的太行冬季生产总结又是太行山人民一个光辉的贡献，这一冬季生产运动是在行动上而不是在口头上直接准备了今年大生产运动，成为实现毛主席“生产长一寸”号召的物质基础。农民有了牲口、肥料和资金食粮，深耕细作增加生产才有保障。应当指出，去年冬季生产很有些地区是自流的，有的在十二月底才发出冬季生产的号召，时间已误过去，有的虽然喊着土改整党与生产结合，实际上并未作任何具体布置和检查，这样，给今年大生产带来不少困难。因此，太行经验值得学习。
    再谈生产领导
    现在春耕存在着的最大问题仍是领导问题。客观上固然是由于干部调动，工作不接气，新干部缺乏经验等，但这正恰恰说明必须要有坚强的周密的领导。据华北某负责农业工作同志谈，目前生产计划在某些地区仍然停留在县，至今尚未深入到区、村，这应引起大家警惕，不要以为有了计划便有了一切。“一切工作在于村”这也是过去一个很好的口号，现在就要到村里去检查，看看生产有无具体领导，有无规定切合实际的计划以及为完成这一计划而在思想上组织上等等方面所做的具体安排？
    发扬友爱互助
    四二支队助民春耕，怀柔翻身农民援助灾区弟兄春耕生产自救，这是在共产党领导下人民阶级友爱的崇高表现！各地应大大发扬，用一切办法把解放区人民都卷入大生产运动中去，造成热潮！
