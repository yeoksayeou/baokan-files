　　Introducing a Good Street Cooperative in Beiping

    Amidst the establishment and development of cooperatives in various districts of Beiping, a street cooperative that has already achieved remarkable success has emerged. This is the Nanxiang Street Cooperative in the 12th District, inside Yongdingmen.

    This cooperative was started by rickshaw pullers. It is located in a small house at No. 8 Nanxiang, no more than ten feet square, but it is piled with millet and corn flour, which are closely related to the lives of the members. Currently, 617 shares have been registered, with each share at 50 yuan, and 220 shares have been collected, totaling 11,000 yuan. Since its opening on the 26th of last month, most of its customers have been rickshaw pullers, so the items sold are mostly sorghum rice, corn flour, millet, towels, pickles, salt, and soap. Corn flour and millet flour sell the most, averaging about 300 catties per day.

    According to Wang Zhonglin of the cooperative, several grain stores tried to unite and crush them as soon as they opened. Their method was to lower prices. However, the cooperative's prices were even lower. For two days, the cooperative's corn flour was twelve yuan, while the grain stores dropped from nineteen yuan to sixteen yuan fifty. The cooperative's vermicelli sold for twenty-seven, while the grain stores sold for thirty-two. The day before yesterday, the cooperative's listed price for millet was thirteen yuan fifty, and the grain stores reduced it to thirteen yuan. After the cooperative consulted the general cooperative, they also sold it for thirteen yuan. When the grain stores further reduced it to twelve yuan fifty, the cooperative had already reduced it to twelve yuan, and the grain merchants stopped lowering prices. The cooperative's listed prices are determined according to the standards of the trade company, so although the prices are low, there is still some profit.

    Song Baosheng, who helps at the cooperative, said: "They don't know we have a strong backer, and that backer is the people."

    Currently, the cooperative has 600 member households, 500 of which are from the working class. Therefore, their policy is to provide various conveniences to the working people. For example, to facilitate rickshaw pullers' purchases, accounts are settled twice a day. Moreover, working-class people who are not members can also buy, but the price is slightly higher than for members. Therefore, non-members immediately want to buy shares after buying things, and the foundation of this cooperative is becoming more solid.

    To reduce expenses, the four leaders of the cooperative do not take salaries.

### 介绍平市一个好的街合作社

　　介绍平市一个好的街合作社
    在平市各区合作社纷纷成立发展当中，一个已获显著成绩的街合作社出现了。这就是在永定门内的十二区南巷街合作社。
    这个合作社是由三轮车夫搞起来的，在南巷八号的一个小房子内，大小不过一丈见方，但却堆满了与社员生活关系最密切的小米、棒子面。现在已登记认股的有六百一十七股，每股五十元，收了二百二十股，共一万一千元。自上月二十六日开张以来，由于对象大半是三轮车夫，所以卖的东西多半是高粮米、棒子面、小米、毛巾、咸、盐、肥皂等。尤以棒子面、小米面卖的最多。每天总在三百斤左右。
    据该社王中林谈，他们才一开办，几个粮店就想联合起来挤垮他们。方法是把价钱落低。可是该社比他们的更低。有两天，该社的棒子面十二元，粮店由十九元落到十六元五。该社通粉卖二十七，粮店卖三十二。小米前天该社牌价十三元五，粮店压到十三元。该社向总社问过以后，也卖十三元。粮店又降到十二元五时，该社已降到十二元，粮商们就再不落价了。该社的牌价是合着贸易公司的标准定的，所以价钱虽低，却总还有点赚头。
    在合作社帮忙的宋宝盛说：“他们不晓得咱有个硬东家，这东家就是人民”。
    现在这个合作社有六百户社员，其中五百户是受苦人。所以他们的方针是给受苦人以各种方便。比如，为了便利三轮车夫买卖，每天结帐两次。而且非社员的苦人也可以买，只是价钱稍为比社员们高一点。因此非社员在买过东西后就马上想入股，这个合作社的基础也就更稳固了。
    为了减少开支，该社四位负责人都不拿薪水。
