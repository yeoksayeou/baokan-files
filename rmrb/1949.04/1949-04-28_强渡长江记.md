Xinhua News Agency, Yangtze River Front, 26th: Frontline reporters jointly reported the People's Liberation Army's crossing of the Yangtze River, stating: On the evening of the 21st, countless assault teams rushed to various ports simultaneously and boarded the designated speedboats in an orderly manner. The assault troops entered the fortifications on the boats and aimed various automatic weapons at the opposite bank. More second-echelon troops were concealed on the embankment and undulating terrain. Thousands of American-made cannons of various calibers silently targeted the enemy's positions on the south bank. Commanders simultaneously synchronized their watches. Except for the continuous ringing of telephones in the command post and the creaking of oars in a few places on the south bank of the Yangtze River, the riverbank was silent. Suddenly—hundreds of thousands of tons of steel began to pour onto the south bank. This was the bombardment by the people's artillery. The enemy's bridgehead positions on the opposite bank, shrouded in the twilight, were instantly buried in thick smoke. The assault troops cheered repeatedly, and the first signal flare rose brilliantly. Then, departure signals in various places formed constellations in the wild sky, echoing each other. Instantly, red flags waved, bugles sounded, and the Yangtze River, illuminated by artillery fire, suddenly saw thousands of white sails rise, flying towards the fire on the opposite bank. Enemy planes hovering overhead in mournful cries frantically dropped flares, illuminating a vast expanse of white river water. The enemy on the opposite bank opened fire, and bombs stirred up water columns in the middle of the river, with huge waves crashing against the hulls of the boats. But the assault teams continued to advance through the waves. A boat was blown open, and the rushing water could not be blocked. Communist Party member Zhang Tianlun immediately put on a lifebuoy and bravely jumped into the rolling rapids, using cotton from the outside to plug the hole. The enemy was throwing incendiary bombs onto the river. The brave men on the boats said, "We'll show you how powerful we are after we land." A quarter of an hour later, the landing signal of the central army rose on the south bank of Anqing, two thousand meters across the river. In the direction of Madang, the western army, advancing in the rain, also lit blazing signal torches on the mountaintops of the enemy's positions. An assault team of a certain unit of the eastern army, whose boats were blocked by mudflats, jumped into the waist-deep water, wading across the fifty-meter-wide muddy bay, and charged towards the enemy's positions with automatic weapons. The enemies, who had just crawled out of their bunkers and attempted to resist, were instantly swallowed up by the storm of automatic weapons fire and the shouts of the charging troops. At this time, more and more signal flares rose into the low sky above the south bank. These were landing signals, signals for occupying the bridgehead positions, signals requesting the artillery to extend its fire into the depth, and signals for the vanguard to expand to both wings and begin to pursue. The Yangtze River defense line, which the enemy had built for three and a half months, completely collapsed under these colorful signals. On the morning of the 22nd, a large red flag appeared on Xiangshan Mountain in Madang. In the sunlight, two lines of large characters were visible on the flag: "Cross the Yangtze River, liberate all of China!"

　　强渡长江记
    炮火映红了的江面，突然扬起几千张白帆，径向对岸的火光飞去！
    【新华社长江前线二十六日电】前线记者联合报道解放军强渡长江情景称：二十一日傍晚，无数个突击队同时奔向各港口，有秩序地登上预定的快船。突击手们进入船上的工事里，朝着对岸架起了各种自动武器。更多的二梯队隐蔽在堤岸旁和起伏地带。数以千计的各种口径的美式大炮无声地对准了南岸敌阵的目标。指挥员们同时用好几个表校对着时刻。除了指挥所里不断的讲话铃声和江南岸几处橹浆的咿呀声，江岸是一片沉寂。突然间，——几十万吨的钢铁开始向南岸倾泻了。这是人民炮兵的轰击。暮色苍茫的对岸敌桥头阵地，倾刻间便埋在浓烟里。突击手们正在连声叫好，第一颗信号弹灿然升起了，接着一处处的出发信号在野空结成了遥相辉映的星座。一时红旗挥动，冲锋号齐响，炮火映红了的江面突然扬起几千张白帆，径向对岸的火光飞去。在头顶乌咽盘旋的敌机，仓惶撒出照明弹，映出一片白茫茫的江水。对岸敌人开炮了，炸弹在中游掀起水柱，巨浪撞击着船身。而突击队依然波浪前进。一只船上炸开了个大洞，涌注的水头无法堵塞，共产党员张天伦立刻套上救生圈，奋勇跳到滚滚的急流里，用棉花从外面把洞口塞住。敌人向江面投射着燃烧弹，勇士们在船上说：“登了陆再教你们看厉害的。”一刻钟过去后，横隔着二千公尺江面的安庆南岸，升起了中路军登陆信号。在马当方面，冒雨前进的西路军也在敌阵山头上燃起了熊熊的信号火把。被泥滩挡住了船只的东路军某部突击队，纷纷纵身跳进没腰的深水，跨涉过五十米宽的滥泥湾，端着自动火器扑向敌阵。刚刚从地堡里钻出来企图抵抗的敌人，转眼间便被自动火器的风暴和冲锋的杀声吞没了。这时南岸的低空飞起越来越多的信号弹，这是登陆信号，占领桥头阵地信号，要求炮兵向纵深延伸射击的信号，和先头部队向两翼扩展以及开始向前追击的信号。敌人经营了三个半月的长江防线，就在这些虹彩缤纷的信号底下全部崩溃了。二十二日清晨，马当香山上现出了一面大红旗，阳光中旗上显出两行大字“打过长江去，解放全中国！”
