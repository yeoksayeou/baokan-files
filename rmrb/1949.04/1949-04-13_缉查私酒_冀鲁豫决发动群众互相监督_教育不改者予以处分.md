　　Suppressing Illicit Liquor
  　Hebei-Shandong-Henan Region Decides to Mobilize the Masses for Mutual Supervision
  　Those Unreformed After Education Will Be Punished
    [Hebei-Shandong-Henan Dispatch] The Hebei-Shandong-Henan region is organizing the suppression of illicit liquor. According to a survey conducted by the Regional Tax Bureau in January and February of this year: in ten counties of the fourth, sixth, and eighth special districts of Hebei, there were 119 households privately distilling liquor, with an output of 23,974 jin, while the amount seized was only 2,538 jin. Some village cadres and honorary servicemen, using the method of pooling shares, contacting others, and adopting the method of mobile distillation at night and secret transactions, have increased the difficulty of inspection. For example, Gao Dian, instructor of Caijiahe Village in Puyang First District, together with the village head, deputy village head, and others, combined with the masses to collect more than 50 shares and privately distilled 350 jin of liquor. After Jia Minghai, the district's industrial and commercial assistant, investigated and seized it, only 110 jin of liquor was handed over, and the remaining 240 jin has not been handed over in violation of the law. Similar situations are numerous. In order to eradicate illicit liquor and reduce grain consumption to support the war, attention to suppressing illicit liquor has gradually been drawn to the attention of tax workers at all levels in the region and even party, government, and civil organizations. On the one hand, we deeply promote the significance of the monopoly to the masses, pointing out that secretly distilling illicit liquor is directly harmful to the revolution and the interests of the masses, and is an illegal act, and mobilize the masses to consciously supervise each other; at the same time, for a small number of repeat offenders who are unrepentant after repeated education, in addition to confiscation in accordance with the law, they will also be given administrative punishment.

  　冀鲁豫决发动群众互相监督
  　教育不改者予以处分
    【冀鲁豫电】冀鲁豫区组织缉查私酒。据本区税务局今年一、二月份调查：河北四、六、八三个专区的十个县，私自烧酒的有一百一十九户，产量二万三千九百七十四斤，查获量则仅二千五百三十八斤。若干村干部与荣誉军人，利用集股方式，联络别人，采取夜间游动蒸烧，秘密成交办法，增加了检查的困难。例如，濮阳一区蔡家河村指导员高殿三与村长、副村长等结合群众集五十余股，私烧酒三百五十斤。经该区工商助理员贾明海查获，仅交出一百一十斤酒，下余二百四十斤至今仍违法不交。类似情形很多。为根绝私酒，减少粮食消耗以利支援战争，现已逐渐引起本区各级税务工作人员以至党政民各组织对缉查私酒的注意。一面深入群众宣传专卖意义，指明偷烧私酒直接有害于革命和群众利益，是违法行为，发动群众自觉的相互监督；同时对少数重犯与再三教育不悟者，除依法予以没收外，并予以行政处分。
