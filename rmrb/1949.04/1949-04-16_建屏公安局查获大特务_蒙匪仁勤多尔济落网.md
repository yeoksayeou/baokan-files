　　Jianping Public Security Bureau Uncovers Major Special Agent
　　Mongol Bandit Renqin Dorje Arrested
　　[Jianping News] In February, the Jianping Public Security Bureau uncovered a major Kuomintang special agent, Renqin Dorje (a Mongol bandit). The traitor and his party of fifteen were traveling through Jianping in a large cart, claiming they were going to Mount Wutai to worship Buddha. The Jianping Public Security Bureau, seeing their suspicious behavior, immediately investigated them and discovered their forged passports and documents such as stationery from the pseudo-National Government. It was discovered that during the Anti-Japanese War, Renqin Dorje served as the "Commander (Lieutenant General) of the Inner Mongolia Bandit Suppression Headquarters" for the Japanese invaders. After the victory, he became the Kuomintang's "Commander of the Inner Mongolia Communist Suppression Headquarters," operating in the Xilin Gol League area of Chahar Province, committing murder and robbery, and doing all kinds of evil. After the liberation of Chahar Province, his remnants fled to Ningxia via Suiyuan. The traitor secretly went to Beiping to carry out espionage activities and once flew to Nanjing to meet the war criminal Chiang Kai-shek. After the liberation of Beiping, the traitor did not register with our Military Control Commission and fled from Beiping with his family and followers, and was thus apprehended by us.

　　建屏公安局查获大特务
  　蒙匪仁勤多尔济落网
    【建屏讯】建屏公安局于二月查获国民党大特务仁勤多尔济（蒙匪）。该逆一行共十五人搭乘大车路过建屏，扬言去五台山拜佛。建屏公安局见其行迹可疑，即严加查询，发现他们的伪造护照，并查出伪国民政府信笺等物。查仁逆在抗日战争时期，即充当日寇“内蒙剿匪总司令（中将）”，胜利后，又变为国民党“内蒙剿共总司令”，活动于察省锡林郭勒盟一带，杀人劫掠，无恶不作。察省解放以后，其残部经绥远窜往宁夏。该逆则潜赴北平，进行特务活动，曾一度飞南京去见战犯蒋介石。北平解放后，该逆不向我军管会登记，又携其家属随从由平逃出，遂被我查获。
