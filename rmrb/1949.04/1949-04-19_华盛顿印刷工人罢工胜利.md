　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 16th: According to a United Press report, the strike by printing, typesetting, and stereotyping workers in Washington, D.C., which began on the 11th for increased wages, ended victoriously on the 13th. Workers and publishers of four daily newspapers signed a new contract, effective from February 7th, when the old contract expired, to February 7th, 1951. The new contract requires a wage increase of $6 per week, and wages will be renegotiated within 30 days before the contract expires. During the workers' strike, many newspapers in Washington ceased publication.
　　
　　Electric News Agency, New York, 17th: American reactionary newspapers, which aim to pursue profits and deceive readers, devote 40 percent of their space to a large amount of anti-Soviet and anti-democratic fabricated news and yellow journalism to anesthetize readers. The remaining 60 percent is devoted to commercial and political advertisements. In 1948, advertisers spent 389 million US dollars to purchase newspaper space to influence general public opinion. The deceptive nature of American advertising can be seen from the following example. Last year, the reactionary ringleader Henry Luce's Time magazine published a photo of a car damaged after crashing into a tree on the highway, with an editor's note below the photo: "Post-war cars are not as sturdy as pre-war cars." However, the car had a "Chrysler" trademark. As a result, the boss of Chrysler Automobile Company immediately notified Time magazine company to stop placing advertisements in the magazine. Time magazine hurriedly corrected in the next issue: The description in the car advertisement photo published in the previous issue was inconsistent with the facts. Post-war cars, even if not more sturdy than pre-war cars, are as sturdy as pre-war cars.

　　华盛顿印刷工人罢工胜利
    【新华社北平十六日电】据合众社消息，华盛顿印刷、排字与浇版工人十一日为增加工资而举行的罢工，于十三日胜利结束。四家日报的工人和出版商签订了新合同，有效期间为自旧合同失效二月七日至一九五一年二月七日，新合同要求增加工资每周六美元，并在合同期满前三十天以内重新讨程工资。在工人罢工过论中，华盛顿有许多家报纸停刊。
    【新华社北平十七日电】据电通社纽约讯：以追求利润和欺骗读者为目的的美国反动报纸，除了百分之四十的篇幅刊载大量反苏反民主的捏造消息和麻醉读者的黄色新闻外，百分之六十的篇幅是供给商业和政治性的广告的。一九四八年各报的广告主顾曾经花了三亿八千九百万美元购买报纸篇幅，来影响一般社会舆论。美国广告的欺骗性，可以从下述例子看出来。去年，反动头子亨利·鲁斯的时代杂志，曾经刊出一张撞着公路上的树木而破坏的汽车照片，照片下面并附了编者的说明：“战后的汽车已不如战前的坚固了。”但是这辆汽车上却有“克利斯勒”商标。于是，克利斯勒汽车公司的老板，马上通知时代杂志公司，停止在该杂志上登载广告。时代杂志便连忙在下一期更正说：上期本刊所登汽车启事照片上的说明，与事实不符。战后的汽车纵不比战前更加坚固，也和战前一样坚固。
