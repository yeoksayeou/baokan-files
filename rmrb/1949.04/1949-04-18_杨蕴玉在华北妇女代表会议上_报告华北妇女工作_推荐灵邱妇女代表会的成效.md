　　【Our Newspaper News】On the second (16th) day of the North China Women's Representative Conference, Comrade Qu Mengjue conveyed the resolution of the First National Women's Congress of China on current tasks. She suggested that the North China Women's Representative Conference specifically study and arrange future work in accordance with the spirit of this resolution in order to implement it. On the morning of the third (17th), Comrade Yang Yunyu reported on women's work in North China, and provided the conference with reference opinions on the specific issues mentioned in Comrade Bo Yibo's report and Comrade Qu Mengjue's transmission. First, she pointed out that in the past, women's work in North China, combined with other tasks, achieved considerable success under the correct leadership of the Party, the coordinated cooperation of various parties, and the efforts of women's work cadres, making great contributions to the revolutionary war. At present, with the basic liberation of the North China Liberated Area, restoring and developing urban and rural production has become the most central and fundamental task of the people of North China, and women's work must continue to exert its strength, mobilizing and organizing the vast number of urban and rural working women to strive for production and construction. She pointed out that in terms of urban production, we should first educate and mobilize women workers in various enterprises, appropriately improve their working conditions, and improve their production enthusiasm and production technology in order to restore and develop production. Organizing the production of urban working women should be based on local production conditions and needs, adopting various appropriate organizational forms and combining with urban industry to develop necessary handicrafts. Regarding rural production, she proposed to organize women to participate in cooperatives, in accordance with the principles of voluntariness and equivalence, to give play to women's production enthusiasm, and mobilize the vast number of working women to participate in agricultural and sideline production. Comrade Yang continued to talk about specific issues such as whether women should bring a share of land when they marry, and believed that women's rights (such as land ownership) should be protected under conditions that are conducive to production.
　　Finally, she talked about the organizational form of women's organizations, and especially recommended the experience of Lingqiu women's work in achieving good results through the form of representative conferences, believing that the advantages of this organizational form are mainly that it can well combine leadership with the masses, absorb the opinions of women from many aspects, promote democracy, and cultivate and educate cadres. After the report, group discussions were held in the afternoon, and everyone spoke enthusiastically.

　　杨蕴玉在华北妇女代表会议上
  　报告华北妇女工作
    推荐灵邱妇女代表会的成效
    【本报讯】华北妇女代表会议的第二（十六）日，由区梦觉同志传达中国妇女第一次全国代表大会关于当前任务的决议。她建议华北妇女代表会议根据这个决议的精神具体研究与布置今后的工作，求其贯彻实现。第三（十七）日上午杨蕴玉同志报告华北的妇女工作，并对于薄一波同志的报告和区梦觉同志的传达中所提及的各项具体问题，向大会提供了参考性的意见。首先，她指出：过去华北的妇女工作结合其他各种工作，在党的正确领导，各方面协同配合，及妇女工作干部的努力下，获得相当大的成绩，对革命战争作了伟大的贡献。在目前华北解放区已基本解放的情况下，恢复和发展城乡生产，已成为华北人民最中心最根本的任务，妇女工作仍须继续发挥力量，动员与组织城乡广大劳动妇女，为生产建设而努力。她指出：在城市生产方面，首先应该教育与发动各种企业中的妇女职工，适当改善她们的劳动条件，提高其生产积极性与生产技术，以恢复与发展生产。组织城市劳动妇女的生产，应该根据当地的生产条件与需要，采取各种适当的组织形式，与城市工业相结合，发展必要的手工业。关于农村生产，她提出要组织妇女参加合作社，依照自愿与等价的原则，发挥妇女生产积极性，动员广大劳动妇女，参加农业与副业生产。杨同志继续谈到妇女出嫁是否带一份土地等具体问题，认为应在有利于生产的情况下，维护妇女应享的权利（土地所有权等）。
    最后，她谈到妇女组织形式问题，特别推荐灵邱妇女工作通过代表会的形式，收到良好成效的经验，认为代表会这一组织形式的好处，主要在于能很好地使领导与群众结合，多方面吸收妇女群众的意见，发扬民主，培养教育干部。报告毕，下午即进行小组讨论，大家均踊跃发言。
