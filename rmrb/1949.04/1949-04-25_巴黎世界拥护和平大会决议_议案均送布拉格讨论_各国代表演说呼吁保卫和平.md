Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 24th: Paris dispatch: The Paris World Congress of Partisans of Peace passed a resolution recognizing that the Peace Congress convened in Prague is an indivisible part of the Paris Peace Congress. Representatives from China, Poland, the Soviet Union, Bulgaria, Germany, Romania, Albania, Austria, Democratic Greece, and other countries, who were unable to attend the Paris Congress due to the French government's refusal to issue entry visas and are currently staying in Prague, are formal participants in the Paris World Congress of Partisans of Peace. All resolutions, suggestions, and materials related to the work of the Paris Peace Congress must be transferred to the representatives in Prague for discussion and adoption. Important speeches from the Paris Congress will be transmitted to the Prague Congress using magnetic loudspeakers. The Congress will also send Italian representative Griffoni and representative from French Equatorial Africa, Darboussier, to Prague to maintain contact with the representatives there.

　　During the second meeting of the first day (April 20th) of the Congress, some commissioners from the delegations of France, Indonesia, and 14 other countries were added to the presidium. In addition to speeches by Italian representative Nenni and black singer Robeson, French representative Farge also spoke. He emphasized the danger of the policies pursued by American imperialists and their lackeys in France to France and the world, a policy aimed at reviving the strength of West Germany without eradicating Nazism. France and Italy called for strong action to defend peace and stop the war. The Congress held a meeting on the afternoon of the second day (April 21st), chaired by Darboussier (representative of French Equatorial Africa), who read letters and telegrams from various groups and individuals from all over the world supporting the Congress. These letters and telegrams congratulated and wished success to the cause of peace. A telegram from Oyama Ikuo, chairman of the Japanese Preparatory Committee for the World Peace Congress, stated that the Japanese delegation was unable to attend the Congress due to the prohibition of the American authorities, but the Preparatory Committee decided to convene a peace congress in Japan on April 25th and 26th.

　　The Chinese delegation in Prague, comprising forty people, sent a telegram to the Congress, announcing that the French Consulate in Prague had once again confirmed its refusal to grant entry visas to the Chinese delegation. The Chinese delegation expressed its indignation at this vicious and stupid action by the French government under the command of American imperialists.

　　The first to speak at the afternoon meeting were: the head of the Soviet delegation, Fadeyev, the chairman of the International Democratic Women's Federation, Mrs. Gordon, Mexican representative Lombardo Toledano, and representatives from Poland, Hungary, Cuba, Czechoslovakia, Italy, Britain, and other countries. They unanimously expressed their determination to fight for the defense of peace.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 24th: Paris dispatch: Soviet representative Fadeyev chaired the morning session of the third day (April 22nd) of the Paris World Congress of Partisans of Peace. Representatives from various countries continued to speak.

　　When Soviet representative Kosmodemyanskaya stood up to recount the heroic struggle of the Soviet people in the war against Hitler's Germany, as well as the heroic deeds of her sacrificed daughter Danya (original name Zoya) and son Alexander, the hall resounded with prolonged applause. A delegation of children from the Gennevilliers district near Paris immediately presented flowers to Kosmodemyanskaya to pay their respects, and the entire audience applauded.

　　American representative, black historian Professor Du Bois, delivered a speech expressing his fervent hatred for the oppressors of the colonial peoples. He said that the struggle of the colonial peoples against enslavement is a contribution to the cause of peace.

　　The next speaker was the Greek representative, the famous Greek female writer Asoti. She explained how Democratic Greece has been thwarting the plan of the British and American general staffs to establish an anti-people democratic strategic base in Greece for more than four years. Tens of thousands of Greek patriots have been fighting against 300,000 royalist fascist troops, even though the royalist fascists received 600 million US dollars worth of American military equipment by the end of 1948. Asoti compared the Nazi aid to Franco's Spain with the American aid to royalist fascist Greece today. She said: The support of peace advocates for Democratic Greece is a contribution to the defense of world peace.

　　Many delegations of Parisian workers came to pay their respects to the Congress.

　　The provost of Prague University, Mukusky, then spoke on behalf of Czech scientists, urging the world's scientists to unite their efforts to defend world peace.

    大会第一日（二十日）的第二次会议，将法国、印尼等十四国代表团的某些专员补入主席团。会上除意大利代表南尼与黑人歌手罗伯逊发言之外，还有法国代表法奇的发言。他着重指出美国帝国主义分子及其在法国的仆从所奉行的政策对法国和全世界的危险性，这一政策旨在复活并没有清除纳粹的西德的力量。法意呼吁采取强有力的行动来保卫和平和制止战争大会第二日（二十一日）下午举行会议，主席达尔鲍塞尔（法属赤道非洲代表）宣读川流的世界各地各团体和个人支持大会的函电，这些函电祝贺和希望和平事业的成功。世界和平大会日本筹委会主席大山育南的电报说：由于美国当局的禁止，日本代表团未能出席大会，但筹委会决定于四月二十五日、二十六日两天在日本召开和平大会。
    现在布拉格的包括四十人的中国代表团致电大会，宣布布拉格法国领事馆再度证实拒绝给中国代表团以入境签证。中国代表团对法国政府在美国帝国主义分子指挥下的这一恶毒而愚蠢的行动，表示愤慨。
    在下午会议上首先发表演说的有：苏联代表团团长法捷耶夫、国际民主妇联主席戈登夫人、墨西哥代表伦巴多·托列达诺及波兰、匈牙利、古巴、捷克、意大利、英国等国代表。他们一致表示决心为保卫和平而奋斗。

    当苏联代表考斯莫杰米扬斯卡雅起立叙述苏联人民在反对希特勒德国的战争中的英勇斗争，以及她已牺牲了的女儿丹娘（原名索雅）、儿子亚历山大的英雄业绩时，大厅中长久地震响着鼓掌声。巴黎近郊詹那维里尔区儿童的代表团当即向考斯莫杰米扬斯卡雅献花致敬，全场鼓掌。

    继起发言的是希腊代表——著名的希腊女作家阿琐蒂。她说明民主希腊四年多以来如何一直挫败着英、美参谋总部在希腊建立反人民民主的战略基地的计划。数万希腊爱国者一直在打击三十万保皇法西斯军队，虽然保皇法西斯在一九四八年底前得到价值六亿美元的美国军事装备。阿琐蒂把纳粹对佛朗哥西班牙的援助与美国今天对保皇法西斯希腊的援助作一比拟。她说：和平的拥护者援助民主希腊，就是对保卫世界和平的贡献。
    许多巴黎工人的代表团至此向大会致敬。
    布拉格大学教务长穆库的斯基接着代表捷克科学家力促世界科学家联合努力，以保卫世界和平。
