The Zhangjiakou Women's Federation Organizes Women's Production

[Reported by this newspaper] In line with the policy of transforming Zhangjiakou from a consumer city to a producer city, and with the aim of supporting production and improving living standards, the Zhangjiakou Women's Federation began organizing women in the urban area to participate in production in early February this year. First,座谈会 were held with the families of workers, soldiers, cadres, and poor families to conduct education and discover and cultivate core members to take the lead in production work. The wool spinning group in the first district, consisting of twelve women, benefited greatly from the low cost of raw materials. By March 25th, in less than fifty days, it had quickly expanded to seventy-three people (of whom more than 40% were from poor worker families). They had spun a total of 1,098 jin of wool yarn, earning more than 3 jin and 13 liang of millet per jin spun. The third district, in conjunction with the shoe-making cooperative, organized seventy women to sew soles, divided into five groups, with wages paid according to the quality of sewing. Starting on February 20th, they sewed 472 pairs in a little over a month, earning a total of 2,498 jin of millet. Another wool spinning group of twenty-five people in the district spun 224 jin of wool in more than twenty days, earning 300 jin of millet, 82 jin of naked oats, and 2,900 yuan in People's Currency. Some women learned to make hemp ropes, and others sewed socks in conjunction with knitting machines, earning 3 jin of millet per dozen as manual labor. Young women also learned to read and write in addition to production. (Lǚ Guāngmíng)
