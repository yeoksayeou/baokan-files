　　Excerpts from the Youth League Congress
    Stepping into the entrance of the venue, vibrant red banners lined both sides of a long, clean white corridor. Before people could finish reading the striking red characters on the banners, they were swept into the venue by the flow of people.

    Commander-in-Chief Zhu sat solemnly in front of his own giant portrait, wearing a grey homespun uniform and cloth shoes, holding his hat in his hand, revealing his shiny hair. He occasionally sent heartfelt laughter towards the venue. He gazed at this generation of youth. His face was radiant, further illuminated by the magnesium lights of the cameras, shining on his robust body. When Commander-in-Chief Zhu spoke on behalf of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Headquarters of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, the excitement of the people was simply indescribable. Thunderous applause sent Commander-in-Chief Zhu onto the stage, and thunderous applause drowned out every segment of his speech as it was about to end. This was followed by cheers of "Wishing Commander-in-Chief Zhu good health!" and "Long live Commander-in-Chief Zhu!"

    After Commander-in-Chief Zhu finished speaking, the preparatory committee of the New Democratic Youth League of the Northeast Liberated Area presented Chairman Mao with a white silver clock, hung in an extremely exquisite black hardwood frame, like an alarm bell, attracting the eyes and hearts of hundreds of people in the venue. When everyone stood up to watch the banner presented to Commander-in-Chief Zhu and all the commanders and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, reading "Victorious Banner, Pillars of the Nation," there was another burst of cheers.

    Next, the representative of the Central Committee of the North Korean Democratic Youth League of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea presented a flag to the congress. This was a red satin flag with shimmering gold silk borders. Members of the Korean Democratic Youth League personally embroidered on the flag the powerful words: "Respectfully dedicated to the Chinese New Democratic Youth for their heroic struggle for the liberation of the Chinese people and their glorious achievement of brilliant victories." People unanimously stood on their chairs to see the large characters on the flag, and cheers and applause accompanied the majestic military music for a long time.
    In the evening, at a dinner at the Beijing Hotel, Feng Wenbin, Zhang Ruizhen, and Shen Junru, on a high platform in the center of the restaurant, raised their glasses to the representatives and guests to celebrate the victory of the congress. Then joyful songs echoed throughout the restaurant.

　　青年团大会片断
    踏进会场门口的时候，鲜红的锦旗，铺满在一条修长洁白的走廊的两旁。人们来不及看完锦旗上面的鲜红刺目的大字，就被人流拥进会场去了。
    　　　　×　　　　　　　　　　×　　　　　　×
    朱总司令端坐在他自己的巨像前面，穿着一套灰色土布军服，平底布鞋，把帽子拿在手里，显出光亮的头发。他不时向会场发出心底的欢笑。他注视这青年的一代。他红光满面，再加上开麦拉的镁光灯，照着壮健的身体。朱总司令代表中国共产党中央委员会和中国人民解放军总部讲话的时候，人们的兴奋简直难于形容。雷动的掌声把朱总司令送上了台，雷动的掌声又把朱总司令每一段将要结束的话语淹没了。接着就是“祝朱总司令健康”“朱总司令万岁”的欢呼！
    　　　　　　　　×　　　　　　　　×　　　　　　　×
    在朱总司令讲完话以后，东北解放区新民主主义青年团筹委会向毛主席献了一面白色银钟，挂在极为精致的黑色硬木框子上，就象是一面警钟，吸引着会场数百人的眼与心，在全体起立争观献给朱总司令与中国人民解放军全体指战员的一面“胜利的旗帜，国家的干城”的锦旗时，又是一阵欢呼声。

    接着朝鲜人民民主共和国北朝鲜民主青年同盟中央委员会代表向大会献旗。这是红花缎黄丝边光采夺目的旗子，朝鲜民主青年同盟盟员亲自在旗子上绣着雄壮有力的字句：“谨致为中国人民解放的英雄斗争光荣争取赫赫胜利的中国新民主主义青年”，人们不约而同站在椅子上争看旗子的大字，欢呼与掌声伴随着雄壮的军乐声长时不止。
    傍晚，在北京饭店聚餐的时候，冯文彬、张瑞振、沈钧儒，在餐厅中央的高处，举杯向代表和来宾庆祝大会胜利。接着快乐的歌声响澈整个餐厅。
