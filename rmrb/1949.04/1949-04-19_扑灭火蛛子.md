　　Eradicate Spider Mites
　　Jizhong Administrative Office Agriculture Department

　　Spider mites have currently been found on wheat seedlings in various parts of Jizhong and Mancheng, Chahar. In severe cases, the wheat seedlings have already turned yellow. If measures are not taken to prevent and control them, the situation will worsen. Not only the current wheat seedlings, but also other crops, especially cotton seedlings, will definitely be seriously harmed in the future. Now, we will introduce its growth situation and prevention methods for various regions to promote.

　　I. Reproduction of Spider Mites

　　Spider mites are very small red insects, the size of a needle tip, with eight slender legs, good at jumping and crawling. Because of their small size, they easily move elsewhere by wind, so they spread quickly. They cannot eat leaves, but mainly use their needle-like mouths to suck the nutrients from the leaves, so the affected leaves turn yellow, dry, and wither. They have a strong reproductive capacity, with ten to twenty generations a year. They breed even faster in dry and hot weather. They overwinter as adults on wheat seedlings, mugwort, mulberry trees, and other cold-resistant weeds. They become active and lay eggs in warm spring. Currently, it is the time for laying eggs. One mite can lay fifty to sixty eggs at a time, which turn into insects in three days. After another ten to twelve days, they molt three times and become large spider mites. A female mite can live for forty to fifty days. If the climate is suitable and they are allowed to develop, two or thirty insects can produce millions of offspring in a very short period. Therefore, the drier it is, the more these insects there are, and they spread quickly. We had such an experience last year. Because of this, the prevention and control of this insect cannot be solved by simple treatment. Prevention must be carried out from autumn plowing, land clearing, and weeding in many ways.

　　II. How to Prevent and Control?

　　Currently, all irrigated and dry wheat fields should be quickly hoed, and those that can be watered should be watered as soon as possible. Because the wet ground after watering is not suitable for their survival; hoeing the wheat and removing the weeds can reduce parasitism and spread. For long-term eradication, all cold-resistant grasses such as mugwort, Rehmannia root, and swallowtail grass on the edges of fields, roadsides, and under trees must be removed. Because the leaves of these grasses are hairy and mostly prostrate on the ground, they are parasitic sites for spider mites, aphids, etc.

　　Another method obtained by the Eleventh District in practical prevention is to sweep the wheat leaves with a broom, sweep the insects down, and then push them along the ridge with a hoe. If you sweep and push several times in a row, the effect will be greater. Various regions can introduce this method to the masses in large quantities. If you can also water it, it will drown them and the effect will be even greater.

　　In addition, according to the results of a symposium held by the Agricultural College’s Agricultural Vocational Farm, there are also some methods using foreign medicines. These medicines are available in farms in various parts of Jizhong and can be organized for use.

　　1. Lime Sulfur Water: Use one catty of sulfur, half a catty of quicklime, and ten catties of water. First, put the quicklime in a pot, slowly pour in two catties of boiling water, add fire under the pot, and while the lime is dissolving and heating up, sprinkle the previously ground sulfur into it, stir quickly, and when you see the lime and sulfur mixed well, add another eight catties of boiling water, stirring constantly (do not stop), and boil for about fifty minutes. If the water is less, add more boiling water. Always maintain the original amount of water. Stop the fire when you see it boiled into a reddish-yellow color. After it settles for a while, filter it with a cloth, only take the water, and don't take the filtered residue. This is considered complete. It can be stored in bottles or cans, dripped with a few drops of oil on top, and then sealed to prevent contact with air. When using, mix one catty of medicine water with one hundred catties of cold water, add three taels of bean flour and mix into a thin paste, and then spray it on the wheat seedlings. If there are crystals inside the stored medicine water, it can be slightly heated to dissolve it.

　　2. Sao Yi Dao (available at its farm, is a Japanese medicine whose ingredients are mainly lime and sulfur, also called lime sulfur compound).

　　You can use two or more taels of medicine, one tael of bean flour (or one tael of soap), and thirty catties of water (one kerosene barrel). First, use a little cold water to mix the medicine into a thin paste, add it to the water, then use a little water to mix the bean flour into a paste, mix them together and stir. Use it to spray wheat seedlings.

　　3. Sankyo Fish Oil Soap Water (Japanese medicine available at farms) Put four or five taels of soap water into a small cloth bag, put it into thirty catties of cold water, and rub it with your hands to dissolve it in the water, and then it can be sprayed.

　　4. Fish Oil Soap (also a Japanese product, also called Adidankase Soap, available at various farms.)

　　Cut three or four taels of soap into thin slices, soak them in two catties of hot water (or boil them over fire), then add thirty catties of cold water and spray them.

　　5. Dilis Powder (Japanese medicine, available at farms) Use two taels of medicine, thirty catties of water, and two taels of bean flour (or one tael of sesame seed).

　　First dissolve the medicine in a little cold water in a bowl, and at the same time dissolve the bean flour in a little cold water into a thin paste (if using sesame seeds, cut the sesame seeds into thin slices and soak them in boiling water), then first add the medicine water to thirty catties of cold water (one kerosene barrel is enough), stir it, then pour the bean flour paste in and stir it, and then it can be sprayed. It can not only treat spider mites, but also vegetable weevils.

　　6. White Flour Paste Water.

　　First use five catties of water to cook one catty of white flour into a thin paste, then add it to seventy catties of cold water and stir well, and then it can be sprayed.

　　In addition to the prescriptions pointed out by the Agricultural Department, there are also other local treatments:

　　1. Tobacco Stem Water. Use one catty of tobacco stems and sixteen catties of water, soak for two days and nights to make it, and spray it.

　　2. Soap Kerosene Mixture. Use a piece of soap (the best soap), three bowls of boiling water (ordinary rice bowls), and one tael of kerosene, make a mixture, and then mix one bowl of the mixture with eight bowls of clear water to make it, and spray it.

　　3. Spreading mud water on the leaves also has considerable effect.

　　4. Mash bitter bark, mix with some firewood ash, and sprinkle it on the plants with spider mites in the early morning when there is dew.

　　5. Pull out and burn the diseased seedlings (this can be done when there are few diseased seedlings).

　　6. Spider mites are afraid of water, so spraying a large amount of water several times can eliminate them.

　　7. Mashing two heads of garlic and adding a bucket of water can also cure it.

　　8. To prevent infection, a small ditch can be dug around the diseased seedlings, and firewood ash can be sprinkled in the ditch. The ditch should be about seven inches wide and one foot deep to prevent infection.

　　扑灭火蛛子
    冀中行政公署农业处
    目前冀中各地及察哈尔满城等地麦苗上已经发现火蛛子，重的麦苗已经发黄，如不设法防治，会越来越重；不但现在的麦苗，即将来其他的庄稼特别是棉苗一定也会受到严重危害。现在把它生长情形及防治办法介绍一下，各地可以推行。
　　一、火蛛子的繁殖
    火蛛子是一种很小的红虫，个体象针尖，有八条细长的腿，好跳好爬。因个体很小，好借风力向别处移动，所以蔓延很快。它不能吃叶，主要是用它的针嘴吸吮叶子的养分，所以受害的叶子就由黄变干而枯死。它繁殖力很强，一年能生十辈到二十多辈。尤其天旱天热孳生更快。它是以成虫在麦苗、臭蒿、桑树及其他耐寒性的杂草上过冬，到春暖即活动产卵。目前正是产卵时候；一次一个蛛能产五六十个，三天即变成虫；再过十天到十二天，脱三次皮，变成大火蛛子。母蛛子能活四五十天。若气候适合任其发展，二三十个虫在很短期间就能生长千百万子孙。所以这种虫越旱越多，蔓延很快。去年我们即有这样的体验。因为这样，所以对这种虫的防除上也就不是单纯除治能解决的，必须从秋耕、净地、锄草多方面来预防。
　　二、怎样防除？
    目前应把所有的水旱麦田赶快进行锄麦，能浇的赶快浇水。因为浇后地湿不适于它生存；锄麦把草锄去，可以减少寄生与蔓延。为长期灭绝计，凡是地边道旁树下之臭蒿、地黄根、燕子尾等耐寒性的草都要锄去。因为这种草叶有毛，多是匍匐在地，为火蛛子、蚜虫等之寄生地点。
    十一专区目前在实际防除中所得的另一办法是用扫帚在麦叶上扫，把虫扫下随后用锄一ｐéｎｇ＠①，用力顺畦一推。如果连着扫推几次，效果更大。各地可大量向群众介绍使用；如能随着一浇水，那就又把它淹死，效果更大了。
    另外根据农学院农职农场座谈结果，还有一些用洋药的办法，这些药冀中各地农场都有，可以组织使用。
    １、石灰硫磺水：用硫磺一斤，生石灰半斤，水十斤。先把生石灰放在锅里，把二斤开水徐徐倒入，锅下加火，趁石灰正在溶化发热，把早已轧好的硫磺，撒到里边，赶快搅拌，看灰与硫磺混合好了，再对上开水八斤，不住的搅拌（不要中止），熬五十分钟左右。如水少了就再添开水。要始终保持原来水量。看熬成红黄色时就止火，等他沉淀一会用布过滤，只要水，不要滤住的渣滓这就算成了。可以装在瓶或罐里，上面滴上几点油然后把口封密，不使与空气接触。使用时每一斤药水对一百斤凉水，搀上三两豆面调成稀浆糊水就向麦苗上去喷。保存的药水如果里边有了结晶物，可略加热即化开。
    ２、骚依刀（其农场有，是一种日本药其成份主要是石灰与硫磺也叫石灰硫磺合的）。
    可用药二两多，豆面一两（或胰子一两）水三十斤（一洋油桶）。先少用一点凉水和药调成稀糊，对到水里，再把豆面也少用点水调成糊，对在一起搅拌一下就成。用以喷洒麦苗。
    ３、三共鱼油石碱水（日本药农场有）把石碱水四五两装入一个小布袋里放到三十斤凉水里，用手揉搓，使与水溶合，即可喷用。
    ４、鱼油胰子，（也是日本货，也叫阿滴丹卡石碱，各农场有。）
    把胰子三四两切成薄片用二斤热水浸开（或用火熬开）再对入三十斤凉水，即可喷用。
    ５、地力斯粉，（日本药，农场有）用二两药，三十斤水二两豆面（或一两用子）。
    先把药用少点凉水在碗里化开，同时把豆面也用少点凉水化成稀糊（如用用子就把用子，切薄片用开水浸开），然后先把药水对在三十斤凉水里（一洋油桶即可），搅拌一下，再把豆面糊倒入搅拌一下就可喷用。不但可治火蛛子，又可治菜牛子。
    ６、白面浆糊水。
    一斤白面先用五斤水熬成稀浆糊，然后再对在七十斤凉水里搅匀，就可喷用。
    除农业处所指出的药方外，另外还有其他土治法：
    一、烟茎水。用烟茎一斤，水十六斤，泡两昼夜即成，喷用。
    二、肥皂煤油混合剂。用肥皂（最好的肥皂）一块，开水三碗（平常用的吃饭碗），煤油一两，做成混合液后，一碗混合液再配八碗清水即成，喷用。
    三、用胶泥水洒在叶上亦有相当效力。
    四、捣烂苦树皮，和上些柴灰，在清早有露水时，向生火蛛子之植物上撒。
    五、把病苗拔丢烧毁（病苗少时可这样）。
    六、火蛛子是怕水的东西，所以大量用水喷洒几次即可消灭了。
    七、用两头蒜捣烂对上一桶水也能治。
    八、为要防止传染，可于病苗四周，掘一小沟，沟里撒上柴灰，沟挖宽七寸许深一尺，也可防止传染。
