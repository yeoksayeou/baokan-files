　　Workers and Peasants Unite to Cooperatively Produce
  　Tangshan Workers Donate to Eastern Hebei Peasants
    [Tianjin Electric Dispatch] The peasant delegation from nine counties, including Linyu and Lulong in the 12th District of Eastern Hebei, during their visit to various factories in Tangshan, recounted the suffering of the area before liberation due to the "Three Alls Policy" of the Japanese puppets and the Kuomintang bandit troops for many years. Countless people were killed or injured, and property was looted, creating a "no-man's land." As a result, the peasants in the area currently face many difficulties in spring plowing, such as a lack of agricultural tools, livestock, fertilizer, and seeds. Upon hearing this, the workers in various factories and mines launched a donation campaign. By the 14th, they had donated more than 360,000 yuan in RMB and many pieces of cloth and clothing, along with several letters of condolence, stating that "workers and peasants are loyal, reliable, and inseparable brothers," expressing that they should help each other in the future, cooperate in production, support the front lines, and liberate all of China.

　　工农联合协力生产
  　唐山职工捐助冀东农民
    【天津电】冀东十二分区临榆、卢龙等九县农民参观团，在唐山各工厂参观时，曾历述该区解放前连年遭受日伪及国民党匪军“三光政策”的蹂躏，人民死伤无数，财物被劫殆尽，造成一片“无人区”，以致目前该区农民，在春耕中困难甚多，如缺少农具、牲畜、肥料、种籽等情形。各厂、矿职工听说后，便发起募捐运动，至十四日止，共捐得人民币三十六万余元及布匹衣物等甚多，并附慰问信数封，说明“工农是忠诚可靠、不可分离的兄弟”，表示今后应该相互帮助，协力生产，支援前线，解放全中国。
