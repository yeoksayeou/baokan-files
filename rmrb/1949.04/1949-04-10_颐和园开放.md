　　The Summer Palace Opens
    [Ping Shi News] The Summer Palace, which has always been of concern to the people of the city, has recently decided to open to the public. In the past, the garden was controlled by a corrupt clique, and there was no progress in garden affairs. Buildings, trees, and flowers were collapsing and dying. The two-hundred-year-old osmanthus trees were also frozen to death because coal was not issued to the greenhouses.
    Since liberation, under the active leadership of the People's Government, the roads, bridges, construction on the back hill, flowers, and trees that were destroyed by the Chiang bandit troops have been repaired and trimmed. The peach, apricot, elm leaf plum, and Camellia sasanqua flowers on the back hill are all in full bloom. The four most precious magnolia trees have blossoms as big as fists, filling the courtyard with fragrance. The garden has now decided to open on the tenth, for citizens to visit.

　　颐和园开放
    【平市讯】一向为全市人民所关心的颐和园，最近决定开放了。过去该园被贪污集团把持着，园务上毫无建树，建筑物、树木、花卉等塌的塌，死的死，二百多年老本的桂花，也因不给花房发煤，冻死了。
    解放以后，在人民政府积极领导下，过去被蒋匪军破坏了的道路、桥梁及后山挖的工事、花卉、树木，修的修，剪的剪，后山的桃花、杏花、榆叶、梅寿旦等全都盛开。最名贵的四株玉兰花，开的已有拳头大，满院子清香。现该园已决定于十日开放，供市民游览。
