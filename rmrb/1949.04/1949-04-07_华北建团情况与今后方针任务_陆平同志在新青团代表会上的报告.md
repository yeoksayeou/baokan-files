(North China News) Comrade Lu Ping, representing the preparatory committee, delivered a report on the "Construction Situation and Future Guidelines and Tasks of the League in North China" at the second day (April 3rd) of the First Representative Congress of the Chinese New Democratic Youth League in North China. He first talked about the construction situation of the League in North China: Before the North China Youth Representative Conference in November last year, the League in North China was in a typical experimental stage, developing a total of 15,000 League members. The Youth Representative Conference decided on the general principle of League construction and adopted a focused and step-by-step approach to move forward. After the CCP Central Committee announced the resolution on League construction in January this year, the League's work has moved forward another step, and there are now more than 40,000 League members.

	Over 40,000 League Members in North China, the Core of the Broad Masses of Young People

According to the experience of the past two and a half years, it has been proven that we have correctly implemented the CCP Central Committee's resolution on League construction and the CCP Central Committee North China Bureau's instructions on League construction. Although our League is still very small, all those established in accordance with the correct principles of League construction have demonstrated strong combat effectiveness. Whether in factories, rural areas, or schools, League members have played a significant role in various tasks and have become the core of the broad masses of young people. In the implementation of various policies, they can indeed serve as reliable and powerful assistants to the Party and the government. He then pointed out that the achievement of these results is due to the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the resolute efforts of all League members and cadres, as well as the assistance of all parties. However, our work is only a preliminary foundation for League construction. The leading ideology in some places is not clear enough about the principles of League construction. The main manifestations are: in the work of League construction, only focusing on building the League organizationally, and not linking it enough with ideological and political construction. Secondly, the League was not well built from the central work and mass base at that time and place. Individual places created movements for the sake of League construction, and some were too hasty in order to simply pursue numbers. Then he pointed out that the correct understanding should be to let go of the youth movement, absorb a large number of activists into the League in the movement, and after the League is established, in turn, support and promote the continued development of the youth movement, and in this development, consolidate and expand itself. Therefore, the process of the development of the youth movement is the process of the League's development, consolidation, and expansion.

Regarding the League construction work in the old and semi-old areas of North China in the future, he pointed out that attention should be paid to absorbing the activists who have emerged in the past mass movements into the League, and at the same time, we must not give up absorbing the activists who have newly emerged in the current large-scale production movement. There is no need to go through the process of the preparatory committee and re-discovering activists. Select backbones and start establishing League branches based on the existing activists. In the second part of the report, he talked about the future guidelines and tasks of the League in North China. He pointed out that the Chinese People's Liberation War is rapidly moving towards national victory, and the entire territory of North China has been basically liberated. Therefore, the most important and central struggle task facing all the people of North China and all the youth of North China is to do our best to restore and develop production; at the same time, we must also restore and develop cultural and educational undertakings, eliminate the remaining reactionary forces, and build North China into a solid rear area for the national revolution to support the People's Liberation Army.

	The League's Future Guidelines and Tasks are to Organize Youth in Production and Construction

He said: We have liberated North China from the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang, but consolidating this victory and further building a new democratic North China is a greater and more arduous long-term struggle task, and this arduous and difficult work is mainly and unreservedly falling on the shoulders of our young people. But we realize that we are extremely lacking in all the knowledge and skills necessary to build a new country. Therefore, in all construction undertakings, our Youth League must not only exert our greatest efforts to unite all the youth and people of North China to participate in construction and make us a shock force, but more importantly, we must organize and educate all the youth in connection with this actual struggle, so that in the continuous actual revolutionary actions, we can learn all the knowledge and skills of production, construction, and national management, learn Marxism-Leninism, and be good at applying the principles of Marxism-Leninism to living work, constantly improve ourselves, and be able to become the true masters of building and mastering the new country; we must also vigorously develop the League organization in the process of implementing these tasks and educating young people, and unite the broad masses of young people around the League in various forms. If we cannot complete this organizational task, we cannot complete our political task. This is the most basic task of our Youth League in the new situation in North China.

	The Basic Task of Youth is to Learn, But It Must Be Connected with Actual Work

Then he said: "Many of our comrades do not fully understand the above-mentioned basic tasks of the Youth League, so the following phenomena occur in their thinking and work. First of all, the phenomenon of simple model role has occurred, and this phenomenon is relatively widespread. If the maintenance of youth enthusiasm is not built on continuous education and the raising of political consciousness, and not built on constantly meeting their strong learning requirements, making them understand the Party's policies in connection with the general direction of the People's Democratic Republic, then this enthusiasm will inevitably not be sustained. Any revolutionary movement must have its actual material foundation. Secondly, among some of our comrades, there is still such a thought: that they admit that the most basic task of youth is to learn, but they also enter a one-sided idea, thinking that learning is just reading books. Of course, we cannot deny that reading books is one of the completely necessary and important learning methods, but we do not see that it is more important to learn from actual work. Thirdly, there are still a few comrades who always want to leave the central work and come up with a set of youth work in their thinking, as if without this, there would be no independent content of youth work. They are not very clear that without the greatest interests of the people, there would be no interests of the youth, and the interests of the youth must be realized in the general interests of the people. The Party's general policy and general line represent the greatest and highest interests of the people. Only by implementing the Party's general policy and general line can there be special tasks for the youth." Then he said: How should we educate young people with Marxism-Leninism? First, we must grasp the general policy and general line of the New Democratic Revolution, combine them with each work step by step, and through the consciousness of the young people, enable them to implement the Party's policies, experience the Party's policies, and guide them to truly move in the direction of the people's revolution. Second, the implementation of these education must be carried out under the leadership of the Party and combined with the struggle of the broad masses of people to be possible. Without these, the youth will have no political direction, and the youth themselves cannot create a revolutionary movement, and there is no point in talking about educating the youth. If there is such an independentist thought, it is extremely dangerous. Third, we advocate educating young people in connection with actual struggle, not opposing the study of theory. On the contrary, young people, especially young cadres, must study the theory of Marxism-Leninism, study the Party's policies, study culture, and study business. Without a certain theoretical level, we cannot grasp the Party's policies, analyze and criticize experience, and raise experience to theoretical principles to improve ourselves and improve the broad masses of young people, then we will become empiricists. Fourth, the study of young people must also be carried out through the solution of the immediate interests of young people and in ways that suit the interests of young people. Young people still have their special interests. Such as marriage problems, cultural entertainment, sports hobbies, etc., we should improve their consciousness and give play to their enthusiasm from solving these immediate problems and meeting these requirements.

	Cities Should Organize Young Workers to Compete in Production and Strive to Be Models

Then he said: The central work of 1949 is to launch a large-scale production movement and restore productive forces. He explained how cities, rural areas, factories, and schools should implement this central work according to different circumstances: In cities, our central task is to educate and organize young workers to work hard with all workers to restore and develop production. We must respond to the Party's call and quickly learn production work and learn the skills of managing cities. Only the restoration and development of industrial production can improve the lives of workers and the people, eliminate the remaining forces of imperialism and bureaucratic capitalism, turn economically backward China into an industrial country, and consolidate victory. And these urban construction works must mainly rely on the working class. Therefore, we must first universally launch the workers' movement, and then further organize young workers from it to establish the League. At present, the most important thing is to universally carry out political education through various forms to establish new labor concepts and inspire class consciousness and labor enthusiasm. On the one hand, we must inspire workers' sense of ownership, and on the other hand, we must let them know the arduousness of the task and the importance of the responsibility. The lives of workers must be improved, but it must be subordinate to the development of favorable production and what can be done. The immediate interests of workers must be subordinate to permanent interests.

He said: In old-area factories, young workers already have organizations and considerable awareness, but similarly, they must continue to improve politically, and vigorously learn technology and culture, and production organization must be more rationalized. In this year's large-scale production movement, we must launch production competitions, carry forward revolutionary heroism, and League members must fight to create a large number of learning models and production models.

	Rural Areas Should Organize All Young People to Strive for Every Inch of Production Growth

He said: In rural areas, the only work is to mobilize and organize all young people to participate in this year's large-scale production movement, and to strive for the realization of the government's 1949 agricultural production plan, to achieve every inch of production growth. In the large-scale production movement, League members should not only be active participants, but also become promoters of the New Democratic agricultural policy in large-scale production. They should persuade parents and lead parents to become the backbone of various mutual aid organizations, and do their best to mobilize women and children to participate in production and transform hooligans. They should become a reliable labor force for military dependents and seriously treat military dependents preferentially. In the promotion of new technologies, League members should first accept and promote them. League members should also become organizers and promoters of various cooperatives in rural areas. In all these activities, young people should be good at persuading the conservatism of farmers and enable farmers to accept the direction of technical improvement and the development of mutual aid and cooperation. League members should fight to create thousands of production models and production heroes.

In schools, the task of the Youth League is to implement the Party's policy of cultivating a large number of politically progressive intellectuals with scientific skills in schools as talents for the construction of the new country. Therefore, all activities in the student movement are learning as the only task.

About 80 to 90 percent of the students in the old-area schools are children of the working people, and their most important task is to continue to improve their culture, learn various scientific skills, and improve politically.

The same is true for students in the new area, with learning as the central task. It is necessary to universally carry out political education to establish correct learning concepts and a revolutionary outlook on life. This is the urgent requirement of students at present. Therefore, it is necessary to carry out political learning movements, assist schools in strengthening and improving political classes, and also organize various lectures, seminars, and research conferences, and use holidays to visit rural areas, factories, and troops to carry out these movements, and overcome the phenomenon of anarchism and indiscipline in schools. The organization of the Youth League does not need to be established in a hurry, and it should be established in a mature situation from the development of this ideological transformation and learning movement. Our existing League must closely connect with the broad masses of students and humbly learn from the masses. Thoroughly correct the bad work style of serious alienation from the masses.

In order to realize the above-mentioned major political tasks, he said: We must also unite the broad masses of young people in various tasks and various movements and vigorously develop the League. Without a strong League organization, there is no strong material force, and we cannot complete the major tasks given to us in the new situation. The policy is to make universal development in a planned and step-by-step manner on the existing basis. In addition to Shijiazhuang, Dingxian, Pingshan, etc., which must be consolidated and developed, other areas that have completed the key League construction should develop universally in a planned and step-by-step manner, and areas that have not completed the key League construction should develop universally after completing the key League construction. In the future, the Youth League must strengthen urban work, shift the focus of leadership to cities, and learn to do various urban works. We must vigorously launch the workers' movement and build the League from it. And rely on the working class to unite the broad masses of peasant youth, other laboring youth, young intellectuals, and all other democratic youth to form an important force for the construction of North China. In the future development of the League organization, we must oppose acute illness and formalism, and at the same time, we must prevent the tendency of closed-doorism, so that the League is truly built on the basis of leadership with preparation, backbone with training, and the masses consciously and willingly. He said: Ideological and political propaganda and education work must be adapted to the development of the League in organization, so that the organizational development of the League is closely linked with ideological and political construction at all times. Through the exemplary actions of League members, newspapers, periodicals, lectures, night schools, etc. are used to promote the League, and cultural and political education is carried out for young people inside and outside the League. Cadres learn theory and business in a planned manner, and also strive to learn culture.

Finally, there are explanations on the gradual establishment of formal leading organs of the League at all levels, training cadres, and the work of children.

### 华北建团情况与今后方针任务  ——陆平同志在新青团代表会上的报告

　　华北建团情况与今后方针任务
    ——陆平同志在新青团代表会上的报告
    【华北讯】中国新民主主义青年团华北第一届代表大会第二日（四月三日）由陆平同志代表筹委会向大会作了“关于华北团的建设情况及今后方针与任务”的报告。他先谈到华北团的建设情况：在去年十一月的华北青年代表会议以前，华北的团是处在典型试验阶段中，共发展了一万五千团员。青代会决定了普遍建团的方针，并采取有重点有步骤的向前推进。今年一月中共中央公布了建团决议后，使得团的工作更向前推进了一步，现共有团员四万余。 　 华北团员四万余　为广大青年核心
    根据过去两年半经验，证明我们是正确的执行了中共中央建团决议与中共中央华北局建团的指示。我们的团虽然还很小，但凡是按照正确建团方针所建立起来的，都表现了坚强的战斗力，不论是工厂、农村、学校中的团员，在各种工作中都起了重大的作用，成为广大青年的核心。在执行各种政策中，确实能起党和政府可靠的有力助手作用。接着指出这些成绩的获得，是由于中国共产党的正确领导和全体团员干部的坚决努力及各方面协助的结果。但是我们这些工作还只不过是打下了建团的初步基础。有些地方领导思想上对建团方针的认识还不够明确。主要表现在：在建团工作中，只偏于从组织上建团，与思想上政治上建团联系的不够。其次是没有很好的从当时当地的中心工作中及群众基础上建团，个别地方为了建团制造运动，也有的为了单纯追求数字而操之过急。接着他指出正确的认识，应该是放手发动青年运动，在运动中吸收大批积极分子建团，团建立起来之后反过去又支持和推动青年运动的继续发展，在这个发展中巩固壮大自己。所以青年运动发展的过程，就是团的发展巩固壮大的过程。
    关于今后华北老区、半老区农村中的建团工作，他指出：应注意吸收在过去群众运动中已涌现出的积极分子入团，同时也决不能放弃吸收在现在大生产运动中新涌现出的积极分子入团。不必再经过筹备委员会与重新发现积极分子的过程，选择骨干，以已有的积极分子为基础，着手建立团的支部。报告的第二部分，他讲到华北团今后的方针与任务。指出：中国人民解放战争迅速的走向全国胜利，华北地全境基本上已解放。因此摆在全华北人民也是全华北青年面前的一个最重要的最中心的奋斗任务，就是要竭尽我们所有的力量去恢复与发展生产事业；同时也必须恢复与发展文化教育事业，肃清残余的反动力量，使华北建设成为全国革命的巩固后方，支援人民解放军。 　 今后团的方针任务组织青年生产建设
    他说：我们已经从国民党反动统治下解放了华北，而巩固这个胜利，进一步建设新民主主义的华北，那却是一个更加伟大更加艰苦的长期的奋斗任务，而这个艰巨繁难的工作，又是责无旁贷的主要的要落在我们青年人的头上。但我们认识到我们极为缺乏建设新国家所必须的一切知识与本领。因此在一切建设事业中，我们青年团不但必需拿出我们最大的力量去团结全华北青年和人民一道去参加建设并使我们成为突击的力量，而且更重要的是我们必需与此实际斗争相连系来组织教育全体青年，使我们在不断的实际革命行动当中，学习一切生产建设与管理国家的知识与技能，学习马列主义，并善于把马列主义的原则应用到活生生的工作中去，不断的提高自己，能够成为建设与掌握新国家的真正主人；我们还必须在执行这些工作与教育青年的过程中，大力的发展团的组织，并用各种形式团结广大青年在团的周围。如果不能完成这个组织任务，也就不能完成我们的政治任务，这就是我们青年团在华北新形势下最基本的任务。 　 青年基本任务是学习但必须联系实际工作
    接着他说：“我们有不少同志不十分理解青年团上述的基本任务，因此在思想上与工作上发生以下几种现象，首先就发生了单纯的模范作用现象，这种现象比较普遍的存在着。如果青年积极性的保持不是建筑在不断的教育与提高政治觉悟之上，不是建筑在不断满足他们强烈的学习要求之上，使他们了解党之政策联系到人民民主共和国的总的方向，则这种积极性必然的不能持久。任何一种革命运动，必须有它的实际的物质基础。第二、在我们一部分同志中间，还有这么一种思想：就是他们承认青年最基本的任务是学习，但是又进入片面的想法，以为学习就只是要读书，当然我们不能否认读书是完全必要的重要学习方法之一，可是没有看到更重要的是要从实际工作中学习。第三、还有少数同志，在思想上总想离开中心工作搞出青年的一套，似乎不这样就没有青年工作的独立内容。他们不很清楚，离开了人民最大利益，就没有青年的利益，青年的利益是要在人民总的利益中去实现。党的总政策总路线就是代表人民最大和最高的利益的，只有执行党的总政策总路线，才有青年的特殊任务。接着他说：我们究竟应当如何以马列主义去教育青年呢？第一、必须掌握新民主主义革命的总政策总路线，有步骤的与每一个工作相结合，通过青年的自觉，使他们执行党的政策，体验党的政策，引导他们确实的走向人民革命的方向。第二、这些教育的进行，必须在党的领导下，并与广大人民的斗争结合在一起，才有可能，离开了这些，青年就没有了政治方向，青年自己就不可能搞出革命运动，就谈不到教育青年，如果有这种独立主义的思想，那是极为危险的。第三、我们主张联系实际斗争教育青年，并不是反对学习理论，相反的，青年尤其是青年干部，必须学习马列主义的理论，学习党的政策，学习文化，学习业务。如果没有一定的理论水平，我们就不能掌握党的政策，分析、批判经验，把经验提高到理论原则，以提高自己与提高广大青年，则要变成经验主义者。第四、青年的学习，还必须通过青年切身利益的解决与合乎青年兴趣的方式。青年还是有他们特殊利益的。如婚姻问题、文化娱乐、体育爱好等等，我们就应该从解决这些切身问题，与满足这些要求中去提高他们的觉悟，发挥他们的积极性。 　 城市应组织青年工人竞赛生产争取作模范
    接着他说：一九四九年压一倒切的中心工作就是开展大生产运动，恢复生产力。他把城市、农村、工厂、学校根据不同的情况如何去执行这一中心工作作了说明：在城市我们中心任务是教育与组织青年工人同全体工人一道努力恢复与发展生产，我们必须响应党的号召，迅速的学会生产工作，学会管理城市的本领，只有工业生产的恢复与发展，才能改善工人生活、人民生活，才能肃清帝国主义与官僚资本主义的残余力量，才能使经济落后的中国变成工业国，才能巩固胜利。而这些城市建设工作又必须主要的依靠工人阶级，因此我们首先要普遍去开展工人运动，再进一步从中组织青年工人建立团。在目前最重要的是要通过各种形式普遍的进行政治教育，以树立新的劳动观点，启发阶级觉悟与劳动积极性。一方面要启发工人主人翁的感觉，另一方面还要他们知道任务的艰巨，责任的重大。工人的生活必须改善，但必须服从于有利生产的发展与可能办到，工人眼前利益必须服从永久利益。
    他说：老区工厂，青年工人已有了组织并有相当的觉悟，但同样的要在政治上继续提高，并大力的学习技术，学习文化，生产组织要更为合理化。在今年大生产运动中，开展生产竞赛，发扬革命英雄主义，青年团员要为创造大批学习模范与生产模范而斗争。 　 农村应组织全体青年　为生产长一寸而奋斗
    他说：在农村中，唯一工作就是动员与组织全体青年参加今年大生产运动，要为实现政府一九四九年农业生产计划，作到生产长一寸而斗争。在大生产运动中青年团员不但要作为积极的参加者，而且要成为大生产中新民主主义农业政策的宣传者，应说服家长、带动家长，使自己成为各种互助组织中的骨干，并要尽最大的力量动员妇女儿童参加生产，改造二流子。应成为军干属的可靠的劳动力，认真优待军干属，在新技术推行中，青年团员，应首先接受并加以推广。青年团员还要成为农村的各种合作社的组织者、推广者，在这一切活动中，青年要善于说服农民的保守性，使农民接受技术改良、发展互助合作的方向。青年团员要为创造千百个生产模范与生产英雄而斗争。
    在学校中，青年团任务是执行党在学校中培养大批政治进步有科学技能的知识分子。作为新国家建设人材的政策。因此学生运动中的一切活动，都是以学习为唯一的任务。
    老区学校约有百分之八九十为劳动人民子弟，他们最主要的任务是继续提高文化。学习各种科学技能，在政治上再提高一步。
    新区学生同样是以学习为中心任务。要普遍进行政治教育树立正确的学习观点，革命的人生观，这是目前学生的迫切要求。所以必须开展政治学习运动，协助学校加强与改善政治课，还要组织各种讲座、座谈、研究会，利用假期到农村、工厂、部队去参观等去进行，克服学校中无政府无纪律现象。青年团的组织不必急于建立，应从这一思想改造学习运动的开展中，在条件成熟情形下，再去建立团。我们已有的团必须密切广大同学的联系，虚心向群众学习。彻底纠正严重脱离群众的坏作风。
    为实现上述的重大政治任务，他说：我们还必须在各种工作各种运动中，团结广大青年，大力发展团。没有强大的团的组织，就没有强大的物质力量，就不能完成新形势下所给我们的重大任务。其方针是在现有的基础上，有计划有步骤的作普遍的发展。除石家庄、定县、平山等须作巩固的发展外，其他已完成重点建团的地区，则应有计划有步骤的向着普遍发展，未完成重点建团的地区，则应在完成重点建团后向普遍发展。今后青年团必须加强城市工作，把领导重点转移在城市，学会作城市的各种工作。必须大力的开展工人运动，从中建团。并依靠工人阶级团结广大农民青年、其他劳动青年、青年知识分子及其他一切民主青年组成建设华北一支重要的力量。在今后发展团的组织中，必须反对急性病与形式主义，同时又要防止关门主义的倾向，使团真正建筑在领导上有准备、骨干有训练、群众自觉自愿的基础上。他说：思想上、政治上的宣传教育工作必须与团在组织上的发展相适应，才能使团的组织发展与思想上、政治上的建设时时密切联系，通过团员的模范行动，运用报纸、刊物、讲座、夜校等等方法宣传团，并对团内外的青年进行文化政治教育，干部中有计划的学习理论业务，同时也要努力学习文化。
    最后，关于逐步的成立各级团的正式领导机关，训练干部，少年儿童工作等都有说明。
