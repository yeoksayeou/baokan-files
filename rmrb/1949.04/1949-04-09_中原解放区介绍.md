　　An Important Strategic Base for Advancing into Southern China: Introduction to the Central Plains Liberated Area

The Central Plains Liberated Area, an important strategic base for advancing into southern China, is about to be completely liberated. Since the middle of last month, the People's Liberation Army has continuously eliminated important towns and stations around Wuhan, such as Zhengyang, Luotian, Yingshan, Taihu, Yingcheng, Macheng, Anlu, Hanchuan, Wangjiang, Susong, Yingshan, Zhumadian, Queshan, and Minggang. On the 1st of this month, Xinyang was liberated, followed by the capture of Guangshui and Wangjiadian Station, placing Wuhan in a predicament of being surrounded on three sides and backed by the river. Currently, except for areas along the Yangtze River, such as Anqing, Huangmei, and Wuhan, and some regions south of the Han River still occupied by the enemy, the vast majority of the area has been liberated. The entire Central Plains Liberated Area has been connected into a vast expanse.

The Central Plains Liberated Area stretches from the Jinpu Railway (Xuzhou-Bengbu section) and the Huainan Railway in the east to the Qinling Mountains in the west, the Yangtze River in the south, and the Yellow River in the north, with a population of approximately 50 million. Since the establishment of the Central Plains People's Government in March of this year, the entire area has been divided into Henan Province and the three administrative regions of Eyu (Hubei-Henan), Jianghan, and Southern Shaanxi, with 222 county and city people's governments established.

The people of the Central Plains have a long revolutionary tradition. As early as the land revolution era from 1927 to 1936, large areas of people's power were established in western Anhui, northeastern Hubei, and southeastern Henan. After the outbreak of the Anti-Japanese War, the Communist Party of China led the people of the Central Plains to create anti-Japanese democratic base areas in the border regions of Hubei and Henan, and Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu, establishing a powerful people's armed force (the 4th and 5th Divisions of the New Fourth Army), and extensively launched anti-Japanese guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines. After the Japanese surrendered, the Kuomintang reactionaries launched a full-scale civil war, launching a brutal offensive against the people in the border regions of Hubei and Henan, and Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu, attempting to annihilate the armed forces of the Central Plains people in northern Hubei and eastern Henan, respectively. The tenacious and unyielding armed forces of the Central Plains people, under the enemy's frenzied offensive, some fought on both sides of the Huai River north of the Yangtze River and in the Dabie, Wudang, Funiu, and Qinling Mountains, successfully completing their breakthrough; others persisted in local guerrilla warfare, containing the enemy and coordinating with the people of North China in their operations.

In July 1947, after Liu and Deng's army crossed the Yellow River and advanced a thousand miles, thrusting into the Dabie Mountains, the enemy cobbled together thirty-three reorganized brigades, under the command of the war criminal Bai Chongxi, to attack the Dabie Mountains and implement the brutal "three all" policy of burning all, killing all, and looting all for a long time, causing a catastrophe for the people of the Dabie Mountains. However, the soldiers and civilians of the Dabie Mountains always bravely persisted in guerrilla warfare behind enemy lines, constantly eliminating the enemy. After the victories in eastern Henan, Xiangfan, and western Wan in July 1948, which annihilated more than 80,000 enemy troops, the strategic situation in the Central Plains changed. By the time of the great victory of the Huaihai Campaign, the main force of the Kuomintang bandit army was annihilated, and the balance of power between the enemy and us in the Central Plains region underwent a fundamental change. This victory laid the foundation for the expansion and consolidation of the Central Plains Liberated Area.

In the past two years, under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, the Central Plains Liberated Area has implemented various political and economic reform measures, such as suppressing bandits and pacifying the people, opposing the rule of local tyrants, establishing democratic power, reasonably burdening the people, reducing rent and interest, and restoring and developing industry and commerce. The social landscape has been renewed. The reactionary bandit armed forces in the vast areas have been basically eliminated. In the past Henan suffered severely from banditry with the people suffering deeply, now they generally say: "It has never been so peaceful in decades." Workers in the three major cities of Zhengzhou, Kaifeng and Luoyang, have established their own general trade unions, with a total of 20,000 organized workers in the three cities. Farmers in various regions have also gradually and widely organized themselves in the recent period, for example in January of this year a survey of eleven counties in western Henan alone showed that there were 125,440 peasant association members. Thousands of young students are applying to the Central Plains University and the Military and Political University. The Central Plains Women held an interim representative conference on February 10, and women's movements in various places are beginning to develop. Although production and construction could not be carried out on a large scale due to frequent wars and enemy sabotage, significant achievements have also been made. With the help of the democratic government, a large number of flood victims in the Yellow River flooded area have returned to their hometowns to cultivate, and the cultivated area continues to increase. Taking the Xihua flooded area as an example, after the democratic government urgently provided 520,000 catties of grain, 5,000 catties of salt, and 108 head of livestock last spring, and organized mutual aid efforts to replace work with food, and dredged river channels, the farmers' enthusiasm for production was greatly improved. Within forty-eight days, they cultivated more than 300,000 mu, an increase of more than double the area cultivated in 1947. In terms of restoring and developing industry and commerce: a lot of work has been done, such as eliminating counterfeit currency, stabilizing finance, establishing state-owned enterprises, organizing workers and poor people to produce and find employment, and issuing production loans. In the past four months, Kaifeng has issued a total of 33 million Central Plains currency in industrial loans and 10 million in commercial loans, and organized more than 14,000 people to engage in production.

In the past two years, the political awareness of the people of the Central Plains has been raised to an unprecedented level. They deeply realize that there can be no lasting peace and a happy life without completely eliminating the Kuomintang reactionary armed forces and reactionary rule. Therefore, the people of the entire Central Plains enthusiastically supported the People's Liberation War in various battles. During the Huaihai Campaign, 100,000 civilian workers from Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu supported the front lines. People from all over enthusiastically joined the People's Liberation Army. More than 6,000 people from Baofeng and Jia County in Henan voluntarily signed up to join the army, and staff and students also signed up to go south to participate in the work of liberating the area south of the Yangtze River.

In March of this year, the Central Plains convened a people's congress and established the Central Plains People's Government. The 50 million people of the Central Plains now have their unified leading political organization. In the great war to liberate the 200 million Chinese compatriots south of the Yangtze River, which is about to begin, the people of the Central Plains will gloriously complete the great task of supporting the liberation war and will build a free, democratic, and happy new Central Plains.

　　中原解放区介绍
    进军江南的重要战略基地中原解放区，即将全部解放，自上月中旬以来，解放军即连续扫除汉口外围的正阳、罗田、英山、太湖、应城、麻城、安陆、汉川、望江、宿松、应山、驻马店、确山、明港等重要城镇、车站多处，并于本月一日解放信阳，继克广水、王家店车站，使汉口陷于三面被围，一面背江的困境。现除长江沿岸安庆、黄梅、汉口一带和汉水以南部分地区尚为敌人盘踞外，其他绝大部分地区已获解放。整个中原解放区已连成辽阔的一片。
    中原解放区东起津浦路（徐蚌段）和淮南路，西迄秦岭，南临长江，北依黄河，解放区人口约有五千万。自今年三月中原人民政府成立后，全区划分为河南省及鄂豫、江汉、陕南三个行署区，已建立二百二十二个县、市人民政府。
    中原人民有悠久的革命传统，早在一九二七年到一九三六年的土地革命时代，皖西、鄂东北、豫东南即建立了大块的人民政权。抗日战争爆发后，中国共产党又领导中原人民分别在鄂豫边区，豫皖苏边区创造了抗日民主根据地，建立了一支强大的人民武装（新四军四师与五师），在敌后广泛的展开了抗日游击战争。日寇投降后，国民党反动派发动全面内战，向鄂豫边区，豫皖苏边区人民展开了残酷的进攻，企图将中原人民的武装力量，分别歼灭于鄂北和豫东地区。顽强不屈的中原人民武装，在敌人疯狂进攻下面，有的转战于长江以北淮河两岸及大别、武当、伏牛、秦岭地区，胜利地完成了突围；有的坚持当地的游击战争，牵制了敌人，配合华北人民作战。
    一九四七年七月刘邓大军强渡黄河天险，千里跃进，挺进大别山区后，敌人即拚凑三十三个整编旅，在战犯白崇禧指挥下，向大别山区进攻，并长期地实行残酷的烧光、杀光、抢光的三光政策，造成了大别山区人民的浩劫。但大别山的军民始终英勇地坚持敌后游击战争，不断消灭敌人。一九四八年七月豫东、襄樊及宛西大捷，歼敌八万余名后，中原的战略形势即为之改观。至淮海战役大捷，国民党匪军主力被歼，中原地区敌我力量对比发生了根本的变化。这一胜利为中原解放区的扩大和巩固打下了基础。
    两年来中原解放区在共产党和人民政府领导下，实行了剿匪安民，反对恶霸统治，建立民主政权，合理负担，减租减息，生产救灾，恢复与发展工商业等各项政治经济改革措施后，社会面貌已为之一新。广大地区的反动土匪武装已基本肃清。河南过去匪患甚烈，人民受害至深，现在他们普遍地说：“几十年来从未这样太平过。”郑、汴、洛三大城市工人已成立了自己的总工会，三地有组织的工人共二万人。各区农民最近也逐渐地广泛组织起来，仅以今年一月豫西十一个县调查，即已有十二万五千四百四十名农会会员。青年学生则成百成千地投考中原大学与军政大学。中原妇女于二月十日召开了全区妇女临时代表大会，各地妇女运动，正在开始发展，生产建设，虽因战争频繁和敌人破坏，不可能大规模进行，但也获得不少成绩。黄泛区灾民在民主政府帮助下，大批返乡垦植，耕种面积不断增加。以西华泛区为例，去年春经民主政府急赈五十二万斤粮食，五千斤食盐，一百零八匹牲口，并组织努力互助，以工代赈，疏浚河渠等后，农民生产情绪大为提高，四十八天中即耕种了三十余万亩，较一九四七年垦植地亩增加一倍以上。在恢复与发展工商业方面：如排除伪币，稳定金融，建立公营企业，组织工人贫民生产就业，发放生产贷款等，都做了不少工作。开封四个月来，即共贷放工业贷款中州币三千三百万元，商业贷款一千万元，组织了一万四千余人投入生产。
    两年多来，中原人民政治觉悟空前地提高，他们深切认识到非彻底消灭国民党反动派武装及反动统治，不可能有持久的和平与幸福的生活，因此，全中原人民在历次战役中热烈支援人民解放战争，淮海战役中豫皖苏支援前线的民工即有十万人。各地人民热烈参加解放军，河南宝丰、郏县自动报名参军者即达六千余名，职工和学生也都纷纷报名南下，参加解放长江以南地区的工作。
    今年三月，中原召开了人民代表大会，成立了中原人民政府。五千万中原人民已经有了他们统一领导的政权机构。在即将开始的解放长江以南二万万中国同胞的伟大战争中，中原人民将光荣的完成支援解放战争的基地的巨大任务，并将建设一个自由、民主、幸福的新中原。
