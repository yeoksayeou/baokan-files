　　Protesting the Kuomintang's Massacre Atrocities
  　Beijing and Shanghai Students Strike and Demonstrate
    Demanding the Nanjing Reactionary Government Punish the Murderers
    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 3rd: According to various reports, students from universities and colleges in Nanjing announced a strike on the 2nd to protest the Kuomintang reactionary government's massacre of students on April 1st. On the evening of the 2nd, nine student representatives at a press conference demanded that the Nanjing reactionary government must punish the Kuomintang bandit perpetrators, immediately release the arrested students, and compensate the families of the sacrificed and injured students. In addition, they demanded that the Kuomintang Nanjing Garrison Command formally guarantee to the students that similar incidents would not occur again. Student representatives vehemently denounced the statement by Zhang Yaoming, pseudo-capital garrison commander, attempting to cover up and shirk responsibility for the atrocities, pointing out that this massacre was a planned conspiracy by the Nanjing reactionary government.

    Also from dispatch: Three hundred student representatives from various schools in Shanghai gathered on the afternoon of the 2nd amidst rousing slogans and songs, and decided that all schools in the city would strike and hold public demonstrations to protest the Kuomintang reactionary government's massacre of Nanjing students. Chen Daqing, pseudo-garrison commander of Shanghai, and Chen Liang, acting mayor, have convened meetings with the presidents of major universities, plotting to obstruct and suppress the students' righteous demonstration actions.

    Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 3rd: In the "April 1st" Nanjing bloodbath, a total of more than 200 students were massacred, injured, arrested, and went missing by Kuomintang bandit army officers and soldiers. The Nanjing National Academy of Drama was also looted by the bandit army officers and soldiers. According to various reports, representatives of universities and colleges in Nanjing stated at a press conference on the 2nd that the known number of student casualties is: two dead; ninety-three seriously injured; approximately one hundred slightly injured; and ten missing students known to have been arrested. Among the seriously injured students, twelve are in life-threatening condition, and the injuries of many others are also critical. According to a Kuomintang Central News Agency dispatch on the 1st, one of the deceased students was Cheng Luyi, a fourth-year student in the Physics Department of Central University, who died at 6:20 p.m. on the 2nd in Gulou Hospital due to excessive blood loss from a head injury. In addition, eyewitnesses told Agence France-Presse reporters on the night of the bloodbath that they personally saw several students "tied up and thrown into the river" by Kuomintang bandit army officers and soldiers. When students from the National Academy of Drama returned to school after the demonstration, the Kuomintang bandits, refusing to let go, rushed into the school to beat and rob. Only three of the school's eighty students were spared, the rest either having been sent to the hospital or gone missing. Various valuables, pens, watches, and US dollars belonging to students and professors were mostly looted.
