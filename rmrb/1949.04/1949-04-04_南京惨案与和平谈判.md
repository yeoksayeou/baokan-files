　　The Nanjing Massacre and Peace Negotiations

　　At 10:30 AM on April 1st, the so-called peace negotiation delegation of the reactionary and traitorous Nanjing government left Nanjing for Beiping. Three hours later, the reactionary and traitorous Nanjing government instructed its military police and secret agents to commit violence against the six thousand patriotic students in Nanjing who were seeing off the delegation and demanding genuine peace. According to the Kuomintang Central News Agency, as of the evening of April 2nd, one student had been confirmed dead, eleven seriously injured, and eighty-eight slightly injured. Furthermore, according to an April 2nd report by Agence France-Presse, an investigation by university officials in the city revealed that two students had died, twelve were on the verge of death, fifty-five were seriously injured, and more than fifty were missing, with "several students being tied up and thrown into the river." The bandits also tracked down and broke into the National Academy of Dramatic Arts, "robbing the students of everything they owned." "After the looting, only three out of eighty students were unharmed, with the rest being sent to hospitals or missing." This massacre fully demonstrates the "sincerity" of the war criminals and murderous bandits of the reactionary and traitorous Nanjing government in conducting peace negotiations.

　　We have long pointed out that the so-called peace from the reactionary and traitorous Nanjing government is hypocritical and deceptive, its purpose being to preserve reactionary forces and buy time to breathe, so that they can pounce on the people's revolution again at the appropriate time. Although the Kuomintang reactionaries, like wild beasts, have been wounded in the war, they have not forgotten to devour people. The Nanjing massacre shows that within the reactionary and traitorous Nanjing government, there is only a group of unrepentant war criminals, and "appeasers" who use the guise of peace to protect these war criminals.

　　In the two months or so since Li Zongren came to power on January 21st, has the reactionary and traitorous Nanjing government done anything good? Has it done anything that is truly beneficial to peace negotiations? No, not a single thing. Under the rule of Li Zongren, He Yingqin, Bai Chongxi, Zhang Zhizhong and others, not a single hair of a war criminal has been harmed, but the arrest and massacre of people striving for genuine peace continues to occur frequently in the Kuomintang-controlled areas throughout the country, with the Nanjing massacre reaching the pinnacle of publicly killing people during this period. The Nanjing massacre once again tells the Chinese people that it is impossible to expect the Kuomintang war criminal clique to lay down their butcher knives. The Nanjing massacre also once again tells the Chinese people that any reservation and protection of this war criminal clique means that peace in China cannot be achieved. The Nanjing massacre also once again tells the Chinese people that if the Chinese people want to fight for survival, freedom, and peace, they must resolutely, thoroughly, cleanly, and completely sweep away this group of man-eating beasts. The Nanjing massacre also once again tells the Chinese people that the effective way to deal with this group of man-eating beasts is not to hope that Li Zongren, He Yingqin, Bai Chongxi, and others will "oust" this group of beasts, because they themselves are war criminals, protecting each other, and they still do not want to break with Jiang Jieshi and other extremely vicious war criminals. The effective way to eliminate the Jiang Jieshi reactionary clique is none other than relying on the People's Liberation Army to capture them alive one by one.

　　The Nanjing massacre shows that the entire eight conditions for achieving genuine peace proposed by Chairman Mao Zedong of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, especially the first condition of punishing war criminals, will not allow any modification. The Nanjing massacre shows that those who adopt an attitude of pity and protection towards the war criminals of the reactionary and traitorous Nanjing government are accomplices or conscious accomplices of the Nanjing murderers, and enemies of the patriotic compatriots who were brutally killed by the Nanjing murderer group. Everyone who wants to withdraw from this executioner group, everyone who wants to show that they truly support peace and are not using the sale of peace to swindle and deceive, must express their attitude towards the issue of war criminals. What attitude Li Zongren, He Yingqin's government, and its Zhang Zhizhong delegation take towards war criminals is a touchstone for whether they have sincerity for peace.

　　The occurrence of the Nanjing massacre at this time and place cannot but lead us to question the Nanjing peace negotiation delegation: Where is the peace of your government located? Where is the peace that you are negotiating? Why did your delegation leader Zhang Zhizhong go to Xikou for two days to ask the number one public enemy of the people, Jiang Jieshi, for instructions before coming to Beiping? Why did the great massacre in Nanjing begin just as your plane landed in the ancient capital? If the Chinese people ask the Chinese Communist Party: Why is the Communist Party negotiating with such a delegation, how will we answer? The fact is: the reactionary and traitorous Nanjing government to which you belong has extremely seriously undermined the preconditions for peace negotiations and has used the blood and corpses of revolutionary youth to block the path to peace negotiations. How much representativeness does the peace you guarantee have, even a tiny fraction? How can the people trust you?

　　We have a responsibility to tell the Chinese people that the Chinese Communist Party is genuinely fighting for true and lasting peace. But the Chinese Communist Party will never be fooled by the executioners. We also have a responsibility to remind all Chinese people that countless painful and bloody experiences (today, adding the experience of the Nanjing massacre) prove that the executioners will not have a heart of repentance, and the people's blood is flowing too much under the butcher knives of the Nanjing murderer ruling group. The ancients warned: "Building a mountain with nine piles of earth fails for lack of one final basketful." Today, we must not be fooled again.

　　Since Chairman Mao Zedong of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China put forward the eight conditions for achieving true and lasting peace on January 14th, the Chinese People's Liberation Army has tolerated it for two and a half months, but the facts prove that this tolerance has not changed the intentions of the reactionary and traitorous Nanjing government in the slightest, and has not made them lay down their butcher knives. Now the Nanjing murderer group has used the Nanjing massacre to challenge the Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army. Yes, the Chinese People's Liberation Army will definitely liberate all of China. The time for the Chinese People's Liberation Army to prepare to cross the Yangtze River and wipe out all murderers is not far away, and the time for the liberation of the people of Jiangnan and all of China is also not far away. The executioners' mad massacre of the people can only accelerate their journey to final destruction.

### 南京惨案与和平谈判

　　南京惨案与和平谈判
    四月一日十时半，南京反动卖国政府的所谓和平谈判代表团离开南京飞往北平。三小时后，南京反动卖国政府指使其军警特务向给这个代表团送行的要求真和平的南京六千爱国学生行凶。据国民党中央社消息，迄至二日黄昏止，查明学生中已死一人，重伤十一人，轻伤八十八人。另据法新社二日报道，该市大学方面人士调查，学生已有两名身死，十二名濒于死亡，五十五名受重伤，五十余人失踪，并有“数名学生被捆起来投入河中”。匪徒们复追踪打入国立剧专，“抢去该校学生的一切东西”，“在抢掠之后，八十名学生中仅有三名无恙，余均送往医院或失踪”。这个惨案，充分表明了南京反动卖国政府的战争罪犯和杀人匪徒们进行和平谈判的“诚意”是什么。
    我们早就指出，南京反动卖国政府口中的所谓和平是虚伪的欺骗的，其目的在保存反动势力，争取喘息时间，以便在适当时机再来扑杀人民的革命。国民党反动派这匹野兽虽然在战争中受了伤，并没有忘记吃人。南京的惨案表明，在南京反动卖国政府中，有的只是一群毫不悔改的战争罪犯，以及用和平的幌子替这些战争罪犯们保镳的“主和派”。
    从李宗仁一月二十一日上台以后的两月余中，南京反动卖国政府做了一件什么好事没有呢？做了一件什么已经确实有利于和平谈判的事情没有呢？没有，一件也没有。在李宗仁、何应钦、白崇禧、张治中等人的统治下，一个战争罪犯的毫毛也没有损伤过，但是逮捕和屠杀争取真正和平的人民的事情，却仍然在全国民党统治区层出不穷，南京惨案达到了这一时期公开残杀人民的顶点。南京惨案再一次告诉了中国人民，希望国民党战争罪犯集团放下屠刀，乃是不可能的事情。南京惨案也再一次告诉了中国人民，对于这个战争罪犯集团的任何保留和庇护，就是意味着中国的和平不能实现。南京惨案也再一次告诉了中国人民，中国人民要争生存，争自由，争和平，就要坚决彻底干净全部地扫荡这一群吃人的野兽。南京惨案也再一次告诉了中国人民，对付这一群吃人的野兽的有效方法，不是希望李宗仁、何应钦、白崇禧等人去“排挤”这群野兽，因为他们自己就是战争罪犯，犯犯相护，他们是至今也不想与蒋介石等穷凶极恶的战争罪犯们决裂的。有效地消灭蒋介石反动集团的方法不是别的，而是依靠人民解放军一个一个地去把他们活捉起来。
    南京惨案表明，中共中央毛泽东主席提出的实现真正和平的全部八项条件，首先是其中惩办战争罪犯的第一条，决不容许任何的修改。南京惨案表明，对于南京反动卖国政府的战争罪犯们采取怜悯和庇护的态度的人，就是南京杀人犯集团的同伙或自觉的帮凶，就是被南京杀人犯集团惨杀了的爱国同胞的仇敌。每一个要想退出这一刽子手集团的人，每一个要想表明自己确是赞成和平而不是借贩卖和平招摇撞骗的人，必须对战争罪犯问题表明态度。李宗仁何应钦政府及其张治中代表团对于战争罪犯究竟采取什么态度，就是他们有无和平诚意的一块试金石。
    南京惨案在此时彼地发生，使我们不能不质问南京的和平谈判代表团：你们的政府，和在哪里？平在哪里？你们的团长张治中为什么在来北平之前要到溪口去两天向第一号人民公敌蒋介石请示？为什么在你们的飞机刚在故都着陆的时候，南京的大残杀就开始了？如果中国人民向中国共产党提出：共产党为什么同这样的代表团谈判时，我们将怎样回答呢？事实是：你们所属的南京反动卖国政府已经极为严重地破坏了和平谈判的前提条件，已经用革命青年鲜血和尸体来堵塞住了和平谈判的道路。你们担保下的和平，能有几千万分之一的代表性呢？人民如何能够信任呢？
    我们有责任告诉中国人民，中国共产党是真心为真正的永久的和平而奋斗的。但中国共产党绝不会上刽子手们的当。我们也有责任提醒全中国人民，多少次痛苦的流血的经验（今天又加上南京惨案的经验）证明刽子手不会有悔祸的心，人民的鲜血在南京杀人犯统治集团的屠刀之下是流得太多了。古人告诫说：“为山九仞，功亏一篑”，今天是再不能上当了。
    自从中共中央毛泽东主席一月十四日提出实现真正的永久的和平的八项条件以来，中国人民解放军已经容忍了两个半月之久，但事实证明，这种容忍，并没有丝毫改变南京反动卖国政府的意向，并没有使他们放下屠刀。现在南京的杀人犯集团已经用南京的血案来向中国人民和中国人民解放军挑战。是的，中国人民解放军一定要解放全中国的。中国人民解放军正在准备南渡长江，扫荡一切杀人犯。南京以及其他惨案中牺牲的爱国人民报仇的时间已经不远了，江南以及全中国人民解放的时间也已经不远了。刽子手们对人民的疯狂残杀，只能使它们加速度地走到最后的灭亡。
