　　A Visit to the Tangshan Machine Factory
　　Our Correspondents Lin Li and Lu Hao
　　Walking into the gate of the Tangshan Machine Factory, coal dust flies everywhere. Dozens of chimneys stand tall in the air, spewing out clouds of thick smoke, resembling rain and fog. Inside the factory, railway tracks crisscross, with locomotives dragging trains full of furnace ash speeding by, and the sounds of various machines hammering echo in your ears.

　　Founded fifty-one years ago, the Tangshan Machine Factory is one of the largest machine factories in North China, located at the southern end of Tangshan City, with the Beining Railway passing through on its west side. The factory covers an area of approximately six hundred acres and has more than four thousand eight hundred employees. It is divided into eight departments and thirteen sections, all interconnected links in the overall work. The reporters' visit to the Tangshan Machine Factory took place more than three months after the liberation of Tangshan.

　　　　Three "Liberation" Locomotives Appear

　　Passing the towering red-walled office building and turning southeast, you arrive at the entrance of the Assembly Section, which specializes in the disassembly, assembly, inspection, and repair of locomotives. Next to the shiny black locomotive, workers are pushing coal to prepare for a test run. Inside the spacious factory building, two giant electric cranes, each weighing forty-five tons, are slowly lifting a locomotive and moving it from south to north. Workers are working hard on seven or eight locomotives, installing some parts and disassembling others weighing thousands or hundreds of pounds. After the liberation of Tangshan, the workers of the machine factory rushed to repair the Tangshan, Beiping, and Tianjin Liberation locomotives. At that time, the workers of the Assembly Section worked overtime day and night; some workers ate while reviewing blueprints and making plans. In order to repaint the locomotives, they had to polish all the parts, and some even picked up bricks to grind them. When the new locomotives, adorned with bronze statues of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, rolled out of the machine factory, the workers were overjoyed. In order not to rely on the parts of locomotives imported from the United States, workers Li Shutang, Ma Guian, and others researched and imitated the independent air brake valve (Note 1), using a drill press instead of a milling machine, saving the country a considerable amount of money.

　　In the Boiler Making Section, which specializes in repairing locomotive boilers, the deafening sound of pneumatic hammers riveting boilers makes it difficult to stand. Workers are inside the boilers, using lights to inspect whether the stay bolts are leaking. On the other side, there is a giant two hundred and fifty-ton hydraulic press. Due to a lack of materials, they are taking the 1.594-meter inner diameter wheel rims, which are no longer suitable for current locomotive use, heating them red-hot in a reverberatory furnace, and the hydraulic press compresses the inner diameter of the wheel rims to 1.52 meters. After liberation, everything in the Tangshan Machine Factory is changing. The older generation is beginning to change their conservative technical concepts, and the younger generation is studying hard. They use iron plates, brush them with calamine powder, and use self-made circular tracks for learning. The elderly Chen Guohai is drawing the development of ellipses (Note 2), surrounded by young partners and students with rapt attention. Leaving the Boiler Making Section, I recalled a past event that the factory director told the reporter: Some time ago, the No. 27 boiler in the Fourth Boiler Room, according to the old regulations of the machine factory, was due for major repair. However, Chen Zhizhong, Zhang Fenggang, and other workers in the Boiler Repair Group inspected the boiler and felt that it could be delayed until May because the boiler would require ten days for major repair, and if another one broke down, it would freeze the heating radiators and affect the entire factory's work. They sent representatives to find the director and bluntly said, "We will not repair the boiler." The director, not understanding their meaning, asked, "Why?" The worker representatives said, "The factory director said that we workers can offer opinions." In the past, workers could never sit and talk with the director on an equal footing, but today they were allowed to offer opinions but couldn't express them. Finally, a meeting was held to clarify the matter. The workers' opinion was accepted, and as a result, the boiler only needed two screws and one large flue pipe, and fifteen small flue pipes were replaced. The workers excitedly said, "In the past, it was the Kuomintang's regulations, and they would smash it twice even if it wasn't broken. Now it's our factory, and we can't waste anything."

　　　　Truly Putting Forth Strength

　　The Rivet Making Section is responsible for manufacturing mechanical accessories such as screws and rivets for all the factory's locomotives, passenger cars, and freight cars. Walking through the gate, you are greeted by a two-ton steam hammer going up and down, and the steel-framed factory building shakes along with it. Dozens of iron furnaces simultaneously emit blazing flames. These days, to repair the Jinpu Railway, workers come from 6:30 in the morning to 7:30 in the evening, working four hours of overtime every day. For example, Tian Hongju, a 28-year-old worker, has the raw materials from three furnaces supplied to him alone. A few days ago, on Saturday, he and his fellow workers worked continuously for nineteen hours. The workers' enthusiastic labor competition surprised many people. The section director told the reporter, "In the past, I urged them to work, but now I just count the numbers and check the quality." Some people frankly admitted, "In the past, I didn't understand the strength of the workers at all, so the estimated time for doing work was wrong. Now the workers are truly putting forth strength."

　　　　Able to Cast New Freight Car Wheels

　　After about 150,000 kilometers of rolling, the steel rim of a wheel becomes thin, and after being turned several times, it needs to be replaced with a new one. The employees of the Casting Section of the Tangshan Machine Factory are now able to cast new freight car wheels. This wheel was not successfully made when the Japanese were here in 1939, and the wheels made during the Kuomintang rule were unusable. Now, next to the Casting Section, the reporter saw a drop test machine. Workers are testing the newly cast wheels. Each twenty-ton freight car wheel that leaves the factory must undergo twelve strikes from a one hundred and twenty-kilogram iron hammer on this test machine. They failed seven times, and fifty-six wheels with cracks that could not withstand the hammer strikes were eliminated. But now, almost 100% of the products meet the standards. The long-cherished wish has finally been realized today. Some time ago, in order to rush to cast the portraits of Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu on the Beiping Liberation locomotive, Lu Dangui, a worker in the Painting Room, worked day and night to sculpt the model. Feng Jiankui, Dang Minzhi, and seven other workers in the Casting Section waxed, sifted sand, and turned sand. On the second night after the bronze statues were cast, it was past midnight, and the area was under martial law. They gathered around the fire with joy, talking about the casting process, and were tireless until dawn.

　　　　Increased Efficiency and Unleashed Creativity

　　The Mechanical Section is the place for repairing and assembling locomotive, passenger car, and freight car parts. The sounds of various lathes, drilling machines, milling machines, and planers form a symphony, and the enthusiasm for labor is evident everywhere. For example, Zheng Yukuan, a worker in the section, because another worker was on leave, he stood by the vertical planer to complete the turning of three pairs of wheels. On the first day, he worked from 7:30 in the morning to 1:00 past midnight. On the second day, he worked from 7:30 to 12:00 past midnight. He did the work of two people alone. Also, workers Tao Guangqi and Cao Junrong, whom I saw in the Repair Section repairing machinery for turning wheel axles, turned out four pairs of wheels in twenty-four hours during the Japanese occupation. When the Kuomintang came, they turned out seven pairs in twenty hours, but now they can turn out eight pairs in sixteen hours. This is because in the past, regardless of whether the wheels were uneven, they were always turned slowly, but now they only turn slowly when they see that the wheels are uneven, and they turn faster normally. In the past, the grinding machine would stop every time a knife needed sharpening, but now several knives are replaced and run while being sharpened. In the past, regardless of whether the steel was soft or hard, they would first use a roughing tool and then a finishing tool, but now they don't use a roughing tool when they see that the steel is soft. This is how they save time and increase efficiency. When the reporter visited the Repair Section, the two- or three-minute-thick iron filings on the lathe were like wood shavings coming out of a carpenter's plane.

　　Walking into every department of the machine factory, there is enthusiastic work and enthusiastic manufacturing everywhere. For example, in the Passenger Car Section, they used to buy even the simplest grinding bricks from the United States, but now they use cement, sand bricks, and abrasive powder to make their own. Someone deliberately asked, "Why do grinding stones also have to be bought from the United States?" The workers replied well, "In the past, if we had creativity, the Americans and our factory directors would not have had the opportunity to get rich." In the past, old track planks were scattered everywhere. Chen Bin, a worker in the Tool Section, picked up thrown-away turning tools and used them after sharpening the wind steel. Tang Jichun saw that a file was cracked and turned a large one into a small one. In the past, it would have been thrown into the scrap heap long ago. The Car Frame Section, which is responsible for the manufacturing and repair of passenger and freight cars, accepted the task of rushing to make four hundred and seventy deck pieces some time ago, which required five tons of materials, but only two tons of materials were available. That night, they collected scattered materials within the factory and completed the task the next day. Even the section director said, "I never thought that the workers' strength would be so great."

　كنولوجيا22-meter-long running track is taking newly painted passenger cars out of the factory, and sending the crippled trains into various sections for repair. In this way, the trains running on the railway every day are constantly supplied and never stop. In this way, the workers of the Tangshan Machine Factory are enthusiastically supporting the national liberation war.

　　走访唐山机厂
    本报记者  林里  陆灏
    走进唐山机厂的大门，煤屑飞扬，目睹半空中矗立的数十个烟囱喷吐着团团浓烟，似雨似雾。厂内铁道交错纵横，机车拖曳着满载炉灰的列车奔驰而过，耳边传来很多各种机器冲击的音响。
    创立已五十一年的唐山机厂，为华北最大的机厂之一，位于唐山市南端，北宁路在西边穿过。全厂面积约六百亩，职工共有四千八百余人，厂内分八系十三个所，是全部工作中相互衔接的环节。记者访问唐山机厂的时候，是在唐山解放三个多月以后。
    　　　　三部“解放号”机车出现了
    经红墙高耸的办公大楼，往东南拐，就到了建立所的门口，这里专管机车的拆装检修。漆黑发光的机车旁边，工人们正推来煤炭准备试车。宽敞的厂房内，两个各四十五吨的巨型电动起重机，正吊起一辆机车徐徐自南向北移动。工人们正在七、八个机车旁边紧张工作，几千几百斤重的零件有的在安装，有的在拆卸。唐山解放后，机厂的工人们曾赶修了唐山号和北平、天津解放号的机车。那时候，建立所的工人们昼夜不停地加班；有的工人一边吃饭，一边对看钢版作计划，为着要重新油漆，就要将全部的零件磨光，有的竟拾起砖来磨。当新的机车镶着毛主席、朱总司令的铜像开出机厂时，工人们欢欣若狂。为了不依靠美国输来机车的零件，工人李树棠、马贵安等，他们研究仿造了独立司韧阀（注一），用钻床代替铣床，给国家节省了一大笔开支。
    在专门装修机车锅炉的制炉所，那＠＠＠的风锤铆锅炉的声音，震动得你难以立足。工人们钻在锅炉里，借灯光正在检查螺撑是否漏水。在另外一边，有巨型的二百五十吨的水力机，由于材料缺乏，他们正将不能适用现在机车运用的一·五九四米内径的轮圈，在反射炉内烧得通红，水力机将轮圈内径压缩成一·五二米。解放后的唐山机厂，一切均在变化，年老的正在开始改变保守技术的观念，年青的人正在用心学习，他们用铁板，刷上甘石粉，用自己制造的圆轨在学习，那个年老的陈国海，正在画椭圆形的展开图（注二），旁边聚精会神围拢着的，是年青的伙伴又是学生。离开制炉所，想起厂长告诉记者的一件往事，那就是前些日子第四锅炉房的二十七号锅炉，按着机厂的老规矩，已到大修的时间，但该所修炉组的陈致中、张凤刚等工友，检查了这个锅炉以后，觉得可延迟到五月份修，因为这锅炉大修需十来天，万一再坏一个，就会冻坏暖气包，影响全厂工作。他们派了代表去找主任，劈头就说：“我们不修锅炉”。主任不明白他们的意思问：“为什么”？工人代表说：“厂长说我们工人可以提意见”。因为过去工人们从来不能和主任并起并坐说话，今天让提意见却又说不出来。最后还是开了个会才把上述事情弄清楚，工人的意见被接受，结果这个锅炉只是换了两个螺丝，一根大烟管，十五根小烟管，工人们兴奋的说：“过去是国民党的规定，不坏还要砸他两棒子，现在是我们的工厂，再不能浪费了。”
    　　　　真的拿出力量来了
    ＠工所，它担负＠造全厂机、客、货车的螺钉、铆钉等机械配件的任务。记者走进大门，迎面是两吨重的汽锤一上一下，钢骨的厂房也会随之震动。几十个铁炉同时喷射着熊熊的火焰。这几天，为着正在修复的津浦路需要夹板，工人们从上午六点半来，到下午七点半回去，每天加班四小时。象二十八岁的工人田洪举，三个炉的荒料供给他一个人使，前几天礼拜六，他和他的工友们连续的工作了十九小时，工人们热烈的劳动竞赛使很多人都惊奇，所主任告诉记者说：“过去我是催活，现在只是点数和看看质量了。”有的人则坦白承认：“过去根本不懂得工人的力量，因此估计做活的时间是错误的，现在工人是真的拿出力量来了。”
    　　　　能铸造新的货车轮了
    一个车轮，大约经过了十五万公里的滚转，钢圈就已经磨薄，有的旋过几次以后，就需要新的来代替，唐山机厂铸工所的职工们现已经能够铸造新的货车轮了。这车轮，在一九三九年，日本人在时没有做成，国民党统治时做出来的车轮不能用，而现在铸工所的旁边，记者看到有一架落下试验机，工人们在将铸成的新车轮进行试验，每个出厂的二十吨的货车轮，都要经过这个试验机上一百二十公斤的铁锤锤击十二下，他们曾经失败了七次，有过五十六个经不起锤击而有裂缝的车轮被淘汰，但现在的出品几乎达到百分之百合乎标准了，多年的愿望今日终于达成。前些日子，为了要在北平解放号机车上赶铸毛主席和朱总司令的画像，油漆房工人陆丹桂不分昼夜担任了模型的雕型工作，铸工所工友冯渐逵，当敏之等九人上腊、筛沙子、翻沙，当铜像铸成的第二天晚上，夜已过半，外面戒严，他们带着欢快的心情，围火畅谈铸成经过，直到天明，不知疲倦。
    　　　　提高了效率发挥了创造性
    机械所是修配机、客、货车零件的场所，各种旋床、钻床、洗床、刨床的声音响成一片，劳动的热情到处可见。象该所工人郑玉宽，因为另外一个工人有事请假，他为了要完成三对车轮过旋，于是他站在竖刨床边，第一天，从早晨七点半工作到夜半一点多。第二天，由七点半又工作到十二点，他一个人干了两个人的活。还有，象在装旋轮轴检修机械的修配所见到的工人陶广琪和曹俊荣，日本占领时，他们旋车轮二十四小时出四对，国民党来了，二十点钟出七对，而现在，十六小时就可以出八对。这原因是过去不管车轮凹平，一律开得慢，而现在是看到车轮不平才开得慢，平常则比较开得快。过去是每逢磨刀机器就停，而现在是几把刀替换跑着磨。过去不管钢软钢硬，是先上粗刀后上光刀，现在看着钢软就不上粗刀了，就是这样节省了时间，提高了效率。记者访问修配所的时候，旋床上二、三分厚的铁屑，象木工匠的刨刀吐着刨花一样。
    走到机厂的每个部门，那里都有热情的工作、热情的制造。如客车所，过去连最简单的磨砖也买自美国，现在他们用洋灰、砂砖、砥粉自己制造。有人故意的问：“为什么磨石也要向美国买？”工人们回答得好：“过去要是我们有了创造，美国人和我们的厂长就没有发财的机会了。”过去旧道板弄得到处都是，工具所的工人陈斌，把被人扔在地下的旋刀拾回来，将风钢磨快后一样使用。唐继春看到锉刀裂了，将大的改成小的，要是过去，早就扔在烂铁堆里了。负责客、货车制修的车架所，在前些日子接受赶造四百七十件甲板的任务，需要材料五吨，但现成材料只有两吨多，当晚搜集厂内的零星材料，到第二天就完工了。连该所主任也说：“想也想不到，工人力量这样大。”
    走在货车所和客车所之间的平地上，二十二米长的跑＠正戴着油漆新新的客车出厂，又将残废的列车送进各所修装，就是这样，使铁路上每天奔跑着的火车，能源源不断，永无休止。就是这样，唐山机厂的工人，他们是在热烈的支援全国解放战争。
    （注一）独立司韧阀即单管机车停止用的小闸
    （注二）展开图即是将主体的东西展成平面
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　三月二十四日在唐山
