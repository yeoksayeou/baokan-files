What Comrade Fadeyev Told Me
(Continued One)
Ding Ling

Regarding the organization of the cultural work troupe in the Liberated Areas and the issues of urban theaters, Comrade Fadeyev told me this: "The cultural work troupe is very necessary and important during wartime, and it still has a significant role after the war. There are still 100,000 such cultural work troupes in the Soviet Union. This cannot be canceled. On the one hand, they do mass work and help the masses; on the other hand, they also do their own work, constructing theory from experience and writing the best small plays because they have a lot of contact with the masses. They must have a political line and a certain artistic level. However, the best cultural work troupes can establish theaters in the cities, and there must be theaters in the cities. This requires many actors, and it takes a long time to prepare a play, preferably five or six months. Big cities have this interest, and material aspects can be guaranteed. The theater is used to improve artistic level and the cultural viewpoints of the masses, so it is very important. But an actor should perform at most twenty or fifteen times a month, because they also need to rehearse another play at the same time. In the Soviet Union, theaters used to be managed by the People's Education Department, but now, because a committee of art departments has been established, they belong to the art committee. Some local theaters are also led by the Party's cultural departments. There is an art instructor inside (approximately referring to the person responsible for political and ideological matters), surrounded by the best playwrights, managing the issues of work arrangement and performance. Living issues are handled by other people. Their personnel are all approved by the government."

During these conversations, young secretaries often brought letters or pieces of paper to Comrade Fadeyev. He looked at them very kindly and wrote a few words. He was very polite. When the waiters brought coffee, he always nodded to them and said "Thank you." Once, a secretary brought him a copy of "The Young Guard" translated by Shuifu and published in Shanghai. He immediately signed it, wrote my name on it, and gave me the book. I said, "Excellent, excellent!" Lyuba hurriedly reminded me, "Give him the 'On the Sanggan River' you brought." I quickly took it out of my suitcase. He took it and immediately reached out his hand to me, saying repeatedly, "Thank you! Thank you!" He praised the book's binding and enthusiastically asked about the content. Lyuba introduced it to him. Sofronov asked, "How many copies were printed in the first edition of your book, and how much royalties can you get?" I told him that the copyright system in the Chinese Liberated Areas has not yet been established. Writers do not care about how many copies are printed or sold, nor do they care about royalties. It's okay if there are none. If there are some, it would be nice to buy a bottle of better ink. Writers do not retain copyright and welcome reprints. They all laughed and added, "We were like this thirty years ago." I told them that the average book in Northeast China has a first edition of about five thousand to ten thousand copies. Popular books sell even more. Adding reprints from other Liberated Areas, good books can sell tens of thousands of copies. They were all very satisfied with this number. Comrade Fadeyev then told me, "We used to be like that, just eating together was enough. Later, the state had many laws to protect the rights of writers. If there are contradictions, they can be resolved by law. The Writers Association has its own publishing department. Royalties are divided into three grades, and the grades are evaluated by the Writers Association. Money is also given for reprinted articles. When a play is performed, regardless of which theater or simultaneous performance, money is given. Good works are recommended for broadcast or adapted into movies, and this is all subject to royalties. Because this is the price of his labor, this is the reward given to him by the state and the people, and it is also a kind of encouragement."

Along with my book, there were several stage photos that they took turns observing. They recognized the photos of several Soviet plays at a glance. They greatly admired these photos, especially the Lenin in "The Man with the Gun." They said he looked very similar. I explained the content of some photos, especially several Yangko photos. It was evident that they were not unfamiliar with the name "Yangko" and that they attached importance to it because they knew it was a form of national folk art.

I secretly looked at my watch. We had been talking for a long time. Fortunately, none of them showed any signs of fatigue. I quickly seized the time to ask them what problems exist in Soviet literature and art today and what their central task is. Comrade Fadeyev told me: "Soviet writers held a conference from December 15th to 20th, with representatives from the writers' organizations of various republics. We discussed the literary and artistic development and policies of three republics, Armenia, Latvia, and Kazakhstan, and discussed the issue of drama. The Literary Gazette published a summary of the text: 'The work of our playwrights.' Our task in the Soviet Union today is to demand further improvement, to eliminate the old writers, that is, to eliminate those who maintain artistic viewpoints that are art for art's sake and start from form. What we want is to express real life from a political point of view. Therefore, we must criticize and tell readers who is good and who is bad, what is good, and what is bad. The Writers Association has a Literary Gazette and four magazines. Each magazine sells 60,000 copies. From this, it can be understood how the masses treat our writers." Comrade Fadeyev then gave me a copy of the latest Literary Gazette. Sofronov followed up with some things about reviewing manuscripts. I suddenly thought of a question and asked, "If you have to review so many manuscripts, don't you have time to write articles? Among Soviet writers, is there a contradiction between work and creation, and how is the contradiction resolved?"

Comrade Fadeyev, without waiting for Sofronov to speak, preemptively answered, "Reviewing manuscripts is the responsibility of writers. The tradition of Soviet writers is to help others. The Gorky Museum has more than 50,000 letters he gave to others." Comrade Fadeyev always spoke to me so kindly, as if I were his old subordinate. He was not at all polite and had no false courtesy, as if there was a responsibility attached to telling me everything. I liked this attitude. This attitude made me feel comfortable and made me feel as comfortable as at home, so that I could say whatever came to mind. We had been talking for three hours by this time. The secretary came to urge him several times for some reason. Comrade Fadeyev said a few words to them and apologized to me, saying that he had an election meeting he had to attend and was very sorry he had to leave first. I did not send him out, but I remained silent for a while.

　　法捷耶夫同志告诉了我些什么
    （续一）
    丁玲
    关于解放区文工团这种组织，以及城市剧院的问题，法捷耶夫同志这样告诉我：“文工团这种组织在战时是十分需要和重要，战后也仍然有很大的作用，这样的文工团，在苏联现在还有十万。这个不能取消，他们一方面是群众的工作，帮助群众；一方面也是自己的工作，可以从经验中建设理论，并且能写出最好的小剧本，因为和群众接触多，他们既要有政治路线，也一定要有一个艺术水平。但可以拿最好的文工团在城市建立剧院，而且在城市里面一定要有剧院，这里须要很多的演员，要用较长时间准备戏，最好五六个月准备一个戏，大城市有这种兴趣，物质方面也可以保证，剧院是拿来提高艺术水平，和群众的文化观点的，因此很重要。但一个演员每月最多表演二十次或十五次，因为他们同时还须要排另一个戏。在苏联的剧院过去是属于人民教育部管理，现在因为成立了艺术各部门的委员会。所以便属于艺术委员会管理，有的地方性的也有属于党的文化部门领导，里面有一个艺术指导员（大约是指负政治思想责任的）围绕在他周围的是最好的戏剧家，管理作品排演的问题，生活问题是另外的人负责，他们的人员都是经过政府批准的。”
    我们在这些谈话之间，常常有一些年青的秘书们拿封信，或一张纸给法捷耶夫同志，他很和气的看了，写上几个字，他是非常有礼貌的，当几次侍者拿咖啡来时，他总是向他点首，说一声“谢谢”，有一次有一个秘书替他拿来了一本水夫译上海出版的“青年近卫军”，他即刻在上面签名，并写上我的名字，送给我这本书，我说：“好极了好极了！”柳芭赶忙提醒我：“把你送他的‘桑干河上’给他吧。”我忙着从小提箱中拿出来，他接过去一看即向我伸出手来连说：“谢谢！谢谢！”并且赞美书的装钉，又热情地问这本书的内容。柳芭向他介绍了一番。梭芙洛罗夫即问：“你这本书第一版印多少，可以得多少稿费？”我答应他中国解放区现在版权制度尚未建立，作家一点也不计较印多少，销多少，也不计较稿费，没有也行，如果有一些，能拿来买瓶较好的墨水也很高兴，作家并不保留版权，而且欢迎翻印，他们都笑了，并且加添说：“三十年前我们也是这样的。”我告诉他们一般的书在东北第一版大约是五千本到一万本，通俗的书销得更多，加上别的解放区翻印，好的书可以销几万本，他们都很满意这个数目字，法捷耶夫同志便又告诉我道：“以前我们也是这样，一块吃饭就完了。后来国家有许多法律保卫作家的权利，如有矛盾可以由法律来解决。作家协会有自己的出版部，稿费分三等，等级由作家协会评定，文章转载了也要给钱，剧本上演了，不管哪个剧院上演，或同时上演，都要给钱，好的作品就介绍去广播，或改编电影，这都是有版税的。因为这是他劳动的代价，这是国家和人民给他的报酬，也是种奖励。”
    和我的书一同拿出来的有几张舞台照片，他们都拿去轮流观摩，几张苏联剧的戏照，他们一看就认识，他们很叹赏这些照片，尤其是对于带枪的人里面的列宁，他们说很象，我便解释边些照片的内容，尤其是几张秧歌照片，但看得出来他们对于“秧歌”这名字，是并不生疏的，并且也看得出他们对于秧歌的重视，因为他们知道它是种民族的民间的艺术形式。
    我偷偷看了看表，我们实在谈得很久了，幸好他们都没有露出疲倦的神气，我便又赶忙抓紧时间问他们在苏联目前文艺上所存在的问题，他们今天的中心任务是什么？法捷耶夫同志又告诉我：“苏联作家在十二月十五日到廿号召开了一个大会，有各个共和国作家组织的代表，我们讨论了三个共和国，阿尔明尼亚，拉脱维亚，卡查赫的文艺发展和其政策，并且讨论了戏剧的问题，文学报上刊载了总结文字：‘我们戏剧家的工作，’我们苏联今天的任务是还要求提高，要消灭旧的作家，就是要肃清那些对美术观点保持为艺术而艺术，从形式出发的观点。我们要的是表现实际生活，站在政治观点上的，因此我们要批评，告诉读者谁好谁坏，什么叫好，什么叫坏，作家协会有文学报，还有四个杂志，每个杂志销六万本，从这里也可以明白群众是如何的待遇我们作家。”法捷耶夫同志便又送了我一份最近的文学报。梭芙洛罗夫便跟着又讲了一些审查稿子的事，我忽然想起一个问题，便问道：“你们要审查这样多的稿子你们不是没有时间写文章了吗？在苏联作家里面，有没有产生工作和创作的矛盾，矛盾如何解决？”
    法捷耶夫同志不等梭芙洛罗夫说话便抢先答道：“审查稿子，是作家的责任，苏联作家的传统就是帮助别人，高尔基博物馆就有五万多封他给别人的信。”法捷耶夫同志总是这样亲切的同我说，好象我是他的老部下一样，他一点也不客气，没有虚伪的客套，好象同我说各种话都是有一种责任似的。我欢喜这种态度，这种态度使我舒服，使我能够象在家里一样不感觉拘束的那样想到哪里就说到哪里。我们谈话到这时为止已经三个钟头了，秘书不知为什么事来催了几次，法捷耶夫同志和他们几人说了几句就向我道歉，说他有个选举会非去不成，他很抱歉他得先走了。我没有送他出去，但我却沉默了一会儿。
