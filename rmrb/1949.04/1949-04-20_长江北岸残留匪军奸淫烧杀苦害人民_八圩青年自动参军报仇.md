Xinhua News Agency, Bengbu, 18th: The remnant Kuomintang bandit troops on the north bank of the Yangtze River continue to harm the people. In the Baweigang area near Pukou alone, more than 120 people were killed in 20 days. On the 28th of last month, two squads from the 141st Division of the 16th Bandit Army in Pukou sneaked into Jiangpu County, setting fire to 27 houses and 112 shi of rice. The 21st Bandit Army, which fled from Jingjiang to Baweigang, not only forced residents to build fortifications and breach dikes to release water, but also demolished and burned more than 1,500 houses. Four nearby villages have been completely demolished, and only 20 families remain in Fuxingwei, which originally had more than 80 households. The bandit troops in the port are also inhuman, using peaceful residents as live targets. When the bandits shot and killed a 51-year-old man carrying grass in Huaziwei with two shots, they burst into laughter and enjoyed it. Ten people were similarly shot and killed in Baweiqiaogang, and four people were shot and killed in Liuweigang in two days, including a fifteen-year-old child. On March 9th, the bandits suddenly fired more than 20 shells at Zhongwei, killing 20 children and injuring 4 women. Fifty-two villages around Bawei have been looted by the bandit troops. Many women were brutally raped. A girl in Huaijuzhuang was gang-raped by a squad of bandits. Young and middle-aged men were conscripted into the army. In Sanhezhuang, which had only a dozen households, three people were taken away. The local people deeply hate the Kuomintang bandit troops for their atrocities. Now, more than 100 youths in the area have voluntarily joined the People's Liberation Army, demanding the swift eradication of the bandit troops' scourge.

　　长江北岸残留匪军奸淫烧杀苦害人民
  　八圩青年自动参军报仇
    【新华社蚌埠十八日电】残留于长江北岸的国民党匪军继续残害人民，仅浦口附近的八圩港一带在二十天中即有一百二十余人遭杀害。上月二十八日，浦口匪十六军一四一师两个班窜抵江浦县境，纵火烧毁民房二十七间和稻米一百十二石。从靖江窜抵八圩港的匪二十一军，除驱迫居民修筑工事与决堤放水外，并拆烧一千五百余间民房，附近四个村已被拆光，八十多户的福兴圩只剩二十家。该港匪军并灭绝人性，拿和平居民当活靶子。匪徒在化子圩两枪打死挑草的五十一岁老头时，竟哄然大笑引以为乐。八圩桥港被同样地打死了十人，六圩港两天中被打死四人，十五岁的小孩也不能幸免。三月九日匪突向中圩发炮二十多发，打死小孩二十人，伤妇女四人。八圩周围五十二个村庄都遭到匪军洗劫。许多妇女惨遭奸淫。怀具庄一少女被匪徒一个班轮奸。青壮年则被抓去当兵，只有十多户人家的三合庄就被抓去三人。当地人民对国民党匪军的暴行痛恨入骨，现该地已有百余青年自动参加解放军，要求迅速根绝匪军的祸害。
