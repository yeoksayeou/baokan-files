Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 20th. The China Association for Promoting Democracy has issued a protest against the French reactionary government's restriction of entry for peace delegates. The full text of the protest is as follows:

　　American imperialists, blatantly disregarding the will of the people of the world, have colluded with the reactionary governments of countries such as Britain and France to conclude the so-called "North Atlantic Treaty," and are attempting to extend it to the Pacific, in a wild attempt to dominate the world. On the one hand, they are spreading deceptive propaganda, claiming "defense" in a vain attempt to conceal the aggressive nature of the "Treaty." However, since the Second World War, the political awareness of the people of the world has been raised to an unprecedented level, and their vigilance has been greatly strengthened. They deeply understand that the democratic peace of the world cannot be undermined and must be defended and striven for by uniting with the democratic and peaceful forces led by the Soviet Union. Thus, there has been the recent global peace movement and the convocation of the World Peace Congress. Unexpectedly, the imperialists, knowing that deceptive propaganda cannot cover the eyes and ears of the people, have resorted to a shameless and despicable tactic. The French government has willingly succumbed to the dictates of American imperialism, unreasonably restricting the entry of peace delegates from various countries. We are extremely indignant upon hearing this news. We, like the progressive people of France, must lodge a serious protest against this cowardly and ignorant behavior of the French government. We demand that the French government immediately rescind this unreasonable decision. At the same time, we firmly believe that the democratic and peaceful forces of the people of the world are growing stronger day by day, and no conspiracy can hinder their development. The world belongs to the people, and there is no place for anti-people imperialists and their running dogs. There is no doubt that the democratic and peace-loving people will surely win, and the anti-people reactionaries will surely perish.

  　抗议法国反动政府限制和平代表入境
    【新华社北平二十日电】中国民主促进会顷发表抗议书抗议法国反动政府限制和平代表入境。抗议书全文如下：
    美帝国主义者悍然不顾世界人民的意向，竟勾结英法等国的反动政府，订立所谓“北大西洋公约”，并想推演到太平洋来，狂妄地企图制霸世界。一面还散布欺骗宣传，托言“防御”，幻想掩盖该“公约”的侵略性质。但自第二次世界大战以后，全世界人民的政治觉悟，空前提高，警觉性亦高度加强，深知世界民主和平的不容破坏，必须联合以苏联为首的民主和平的力量加以保卫与争取，因此有最近世界广大和平运动的发生与世界拥护和平大会的召开。岂知帝国主义者们知道欺骗宣传不能遮掩人民耳目，又来一个无耻的卑劣手段。法国政府竟甘受美帝国主义的驱使，蛮不讲理地限制了各国和平代表入境。我们听到这个消息，非常忿怒；对于法国政府的这种表示卑怯的愚昧行为，我们与法国的进步人民群众同样要提出严重抗议。要求法国政府立即取销此项无理决定，我们同时深信世界人民的民主和平的力量天天在壮大起来，任何阴谋诡计都不能阻挠他的发展。世界是属于人民的，没有反人民的帝国主义者及其走狗的地位。民主和平的人民一定胜利，反人民的反动者一定败亡，丝毫没有疑义。
