　　Revenge for Thousands of Cousins
　　　　Qièchǐ
　　It has been a full year since my cousin's death; he died so unjustly, so tragically. He had not the slightest fault, yet he was brutally murdered by the Kuomintang bandit gang's executioners! Let me recount the tragic truth with a heavy heart.

　　My home is in a small city in the South, still under the rule of the Kuomintang bandit gang. Last year, in March, my brother got married, and my cousin came from a distant village to help my family; he was simple, hardworking, and a true peasant. Everyone spoke well of him, and he got along with everyone. On the night of the official wedding, after the "鬧房" (a custom in the South involving teasing the newlyweds), everyone was playing cards, preparing to play through the night. It was late at night when suddenly someone knocked on the door. My cousin, always diligent, thought it was someone from the family and went to open it. In came three thugs with guns, who immediately shouted at my cousin, "Don't move!" He was an honest man and didn't know what to do, so he screamed in terror. The thugs shot him several times, and the poor cousin died instantly. The thugs then entered the house, using their guns to force my brother and all the relatives and friends, preparing to loot. That night, I was too tired and went to sleep earlier. When awakened by the gunshots and commotion, I put on my clothes and climbed from the roof to the neighbor's house to report to the police. Finally, I managed to get a group of armed police officers to arrest the thugs and take them to the police station. At that time, my brother's sorrow was indescribable. A joyous event turned into a funeral. He, a man who never contended with the world, was filled with grief and indignation and said, "I must sue in court and ask the 'government' to punish these thugs who kill in broad daylight!"

　　The next morning, my brother, with tears in his eyes, was preparing how to deal with this unexpected event and avenge the dead. The local police chief came, and my brother asked him to seek justice and revenge for us. Strangely! The chief said casually, "The murderers have already been bailed out." "What? How can murderers be easily bailed out?" my brother asked hurriedly. "No! They are agents of the Military Intelligence Bureau, sent by the 'government' with a mission. Last night, they were investigating 'communist bandits' and cracking down on gambling. As for injuring people, it was entirely due to accidental discharge of firearms. They have now gone to a certain place because the 'government' has given them a new task. Of course, they must be released!" We were all dumbfounded. How could thugs who murder and rob be workers appointed by the "government"? How are their actions different from bandits? My brother pleaded with him: "Chief! It would be too unfair if this case is not handled according to the law!" "Hey! The 'government' will never be unfair in its actions. I am here to discuss with you not to escalate the situation. The 'government' will definitely provide generous compensation. How much compensation do you want?" We refused to answer him, and he left without getting a result. After discussion, everyone agreed that no matter how much money tempted us, we had to avenge. The "government" shouts "democracy" every day, how can people's lives be so easily slaughtered? Appeals were made from all sides, and help was sought from all sides, always wanting to find a righteous helping hand to give the murdering devils the punishment they deserve. However, under the rule of the Kuomintang, officials protected each other, who would be willing to seek justice for an ordinary person?

　　A few days later, one night, a mysterious figure came to my house again. The local Kuomintang secret service chief came to talk to my brother, speaking in an extremely cunning tone: "The occurrence of this incident was all a misunderstanding. Our superiors have expressed their deepest regrets. However, recently, many 'communist bandits' have infiltrated the area, deliberately taking the opportunity to create trouble with the 'government', so this incident should not be expanded to prevent it from being used by 'communist bandits'. We hope you can understand the 'government's' meaning and accept the compensation and be done with it. Now I have brought fifty silver dollars, please take them and bury the deceased properly!" Of course, we could not accept. This jackal showed its true colors, his face became extremely vicious, and he said: "Let me tell you, if you don't do it this way, it will only be unfavorable to you. Hmph! To be honest, recently many 'communist bandits' have infiltrated this area, and whether this guy killed by our subordinates is a 'communist bandit' is very questionable. If the investigation results show that he is a communist bandit, there is no legal responsibility for killing him, and you will have to bear the responsibility of 'harboring communist bandits'." My brother was also forced into anger: "How can you slander people! Who is a 'communist bandit'? Who is harboring 'communist bandits'?" "Bastard! Who is slandering people, you must be a communist!" He took out his gun and shouted sternly at my brother: "Go!" And so, my brother was taken into a dark prison.

　　In the Kuomintang-controlled areas, ordinary people have no place to file complaints, we could only accept the "compensation" and not expand the incident in exchange for my brother's freedom. And so, my cousin has unjustly died for a year.

　　Today, although my hometown is still under the rule of the Kuomintang reactionaries, I firmly believe in the correct assessment of the People's Liberation Army: "Within 1949, the Chiang regime can be basically eliminated and all of China liberated!" At that time, relying on the power of people's justice, let us settle the blood debt with the demons!

　　The day of revenge is coming, let us work hard to support this great war of liberation, so that all of China will be liberated as soon as possible, to avenge my cousin—and the thousands of innocent compatriots who were killed by the bandits!

### 为千万个表哥复仇

　　为千万个表哥复仇
    切齿
    表哥的死，整整地一周年了；他死得太冤，死得太惨。他没有半点罪过，却活生生地被国民党匪帮的刽子手杀害了！让我来用沉痛的心情，回忆下这惨毒的事实经过吧。
    我家在南方的一个小城市里，至今仍在国民党匪帮的统治下，是去年的三月，我哥哥结婚，表哥便从老远的乡村，跑来为我家帮忙；他朴实勤干，一个十足的庄稼汉，没有人不说他好，谁都跟他合得来，在正式婚礼的那天晚上，戚友们，在“闹房”（南方风俗）之后，大家正玩牌为戏，准备玩过通宵；在那时正在深夜，突然外面有人敲门，表哥一向是勤快的，以为是家里的人，便去开了。进来的却是三个持枪的匪徒，当即喝令表哥：“不许动！”他是老实人，不知如何是好，吓得没命地叫，便被匪徒顺手几枪，可怜的表哥，登时毙命了。这时匪徒入内，用枪逼着我哥哥和所有戚友，准备洗劫，哥哥没法只得跟他们周旋，想延搁时间，等候营救。那天晚上，我因为太累了，睡得较早，当被枪声和混乱声所惊醒，便披衣而起，从屋顶爬到邻家而溜出去报警，总算是请到一班武装警士，把匪徒们捕入警局。那时哥哥的难过是无法形容的，喜事变成丧事，他，一个永远与世无争的人，也悲愤填胸地说：“我一定要向法院控诉，请‘政府’制裁这些在光天化日之下杀人的强徒！”
    第二天清早，哥哥含着眼泪正准备如何应付这意外的事件，为死者复仇。而当地警察局长来了，哥哥便请求他替我们伸冤报仇。奇怪！局长很随便地说：“凶手已经保释了。”“什么？杀人犯怎么轻易保释？”哥哥赶忙地问。“不！他们是军统局的特工人员，‘政府’派来负有任务的。昨晚，他们是为查究‘奸匪’和抓赌来的，至于伤人，完全是枪弹走火的缘故，他们现在去到某地了，因为‘政府’又给了一个新的任务，当然是非释放不可！”我们都目蹬口呆了，怎么杀人越货的匪徒，却是“政府”所任命的工作者呢？他们的行为与匪又有何相异呢？哥哥求着他：“局长！这个案子要不依法处理，太不公平呀！”“嘿！‘政府’作事决不会不公平的，我现在正来与你们商量，不要扩大事态，‘政府’定从优抚恤，你们要多少抚恤费？”我们拒绝答复他，他不得结果而去。大家商讨后，一致认为，不管多少金钱来诱惑，我们也得要报仇，“政府”天天喊“民主”，难道民命还能如此轻易被屠杀吗？各方呼吁，各方求救，总想找到一只正义的援手，向杀人的魔鬼给以应得的惩罚，然而在国民党统治下，官官相为，谁肯为你一个老百姓伸冤呢？
    过几天，一个晚上，我家又来了一个神秘性的人物，当地的国民党特务头子来找哥哥谈话，用一种极奸滑的口吻：“这次事件的发生，全是误会，我们上级人员都表示最大的遗憾。但是近来本地‘奸匪’混入不少，专门乘机和‘政府’捣乱，所以这事件不宜扩大，免为‘奸匪’所利用。望你们能体谅‘政府’的意思，接受抚恤了事。现在我带来硬币五十块，请你们拿去好好安葬死者吧！”我们当然不能接受。这豺狼现出原形来了，脸色变得极狠毒，说道：“告诉你，假如不这样办，于你只有不利的。哼！老实说，近来‘奸匪’混入本地不少，我们部下所打死的这个家伙，是否‘奸匪’，很成问题。如果调查结果他是奸匪的话，打死他是毫无法律上的责任的，你还得负‘窝藏奸匪’的责任。”哥哥也逼得愤怒了：“你怎么血口喷人呀！谁是‘奸匪’？谁窝藏‘奸匪’？”“混蛋！谁血口喷人，你一定是共产党！”他掏出了手枪对着哥哥厉声喝道：“走！”哥哥便这样被押进了黑牢。
    在国统区里老百姓有冤也没有地方控诉，我们只有接受“抚恤”和不扩大事件换来了哥哥的自由，就是这样，表哥在地下含冤一载了。
    今天，故乡虽然还在国民党反动派的统治下，但是我坚决相信人民解放军的正确估计：“一九四九年内，可以在基本上消灭蒋政权，解放全中国！”那时，凭着人民正义的力量，再向魔鬼清算血债吧！
    复仇的日子将要到了，让我们努力支援这一个伟大的解放战争，使全中国早日解放，为表哥——以及千千万万遭受匪特无辜屠杀的良善同胞复仇！
