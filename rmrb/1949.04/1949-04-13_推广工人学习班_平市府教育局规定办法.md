　　Promoting Worker Literacy Classes
　　Regulations Set by the Ping Municipal Education Bureau
[Ping City News] In order to reform the unreasonable system of the old society's education, which was enjoyed by only a few people, the Ping Municipal People's Government Education Bureau is focusing on developing worker education as the primary task in its current social education work deployment. To facilitate workers' learning, the Education Bureau has issued instructions to district governments, people's education centers, and district central primary schools, requesting the widespread establishment of worker literacy classes, and has stipulated specific implementation measures: (1) Worker literacy classes will be established in areas where workers and the poor are concentrated in the city. The initial plan is to establish sixty classes throughout the city. (2) School sites will be borrowed from central primary schools and other primary schools. Teachers will be assigned by the Education Bureau. (3) In terms of leadership, the district government will consult with the district Party committee for recommendations, and the Education Bureau will appoint principals and vice-principals. (4) The funding for worker literacy classes will be provided by the Education Bureau, and students will be subsidized with some stationery and books.
Under the joint plan of the Education Bureau, the Preparatory Committee of the Beiping General Labor Union, and the district governments, the above-mentioned worker literacy classes are being established one after another. The Second and Tenth Districts took timely leadership and started classes in mid-March. The worker literacy classes in the Tenth District have become a good way for the district's Party and People's Government to closely connect with the basic masses.
