　　"A Gift of Goose Feather from Afar"
    Jin Feng
    When we went to the Fourteenth Bao to promote support for the troops, an old woman – the mother of a pedicab driver – with cotton wadding showing through her tattered clothes, listened eagerly to our classmates' propaganda, saying how the People's Liberation Army was fighting for us, the people, defending our Beiping, and now they were going south to liberate all of China, and we should express our gratitude to them. To be honest, the propaganda wasn't very sophisticated, just repeating some common phrases from the newspapers, but strangely, the old woman kept nodding as she listened, her mouth opening and closing, and when we got closer, we heard her muttering: "Those children, those children, they're leaving, they're leaving!" After listening to our speech, she clapped her hands and said, "You just don't know, in those days, before the PLA came, the suffering and hardship my Shuanzi (her son) endured, the fear and worry I had to bear! Those 'disaster troops' came to conscript soldiers at night, and my poor Shuanzi, in the dead of winter, had to hide on the roof wearing only a thin cloth jacket, and he got sick from the cold! At home, we were obviously short of food and drink! ... Those days were more bitter than eating 'coptis'! Later, finally, heaven and earth helped us, and the PLA came. People felt relaxed and his illness got better quickly. Before long, my Shuanzi was pulling a rickshaw. We have food and drink, not to mention, my son and I both feel safe at heart. Shuanzi said it's all thanks to the PLA, it's the Communist Party that helped us poor people turn over a new leaf. He earns money pulling the rickshaw, and he's no longer afraid of being beaten and kicked by those plague officers and bad police, and he can sleep peacefully and soundly at night. It's the PLA that saved my son and me. Now they are leaving to liberate the poor in the south, hurry up, we poor people know the suffering of poor people. How many mothers there must be over there with broken hearts, hoping for the PLA to come, oh comrades, luckily you came to tell me, I don't know how to read, I don't know the news. I have to send something to show my gratitude to them."
    She thought for a moment, and said she would go get something and asked us to wait for her. She ran back into the house and after quite a while, she came out, tightly clutching something in her hands, and said to us very apologetically, "I've searched the house but there's really nothing. These are a pair of socks, my son bought them for me after liberation. Can I give them to the PLA?" As she spoke, she opened her hands, a pair of neatly folded, eight or nine-tenths new, dark brown socks lying flat on her dry, withered hands. We were all moved, and shouted in unison: "Yes, Grandma." I secretly felt ashamed, seeing the laboring people's love for their own soldiers, something I couldn't have imagined.
    We also went to a professor's house, but the master wasn't home. An old maid was excited when we explained that we wanted to express our gratitude to the PLA. "Yes, the PLA, I've lived half my life and never seen such a good army. The day before yesterday, I took my granddaughter to the city, and on the way, I met nine PLA soldiers who were also going to the city. When they saw that I looked tired, they insisted on carrying my granddaughter. The child was strange, she was well-behaved in their arms. They took turns carrying her, all the way to my home. They treated us like their own relatives, always calling me 'Old Grandma'." I thought, she had precisely expressed the relationship between the PLA and the people, and the people's feelings for the PLA. She continued, "What should I send? This poor old woman can't take anything out. I still count on taking back home. Send a box of matches, perhaps, a gift of goose feather from afar, a small gift but big intentions, to show my heart. The PLA also needs to make a fire, eat, smoke, matches will be of use." I couldn't help but exclaim: "Thank you, Grandma, you are really thoughtful of the PLA." Today I also learned a lesson.

　　“千里送鹅毛”
    金凤
    当我们到十四保去宣传劳军时，一个穿得破烂的棉絮掉在外面的老太婆——三轮车夫的母亲，她热切地听着我们同学的宣传，说着人民解放军是如何为了我们人民打仗，保卫了我们的北平，如今他们要南下解放全中国了，我们应该慰劳他们。实在说，这宣传是并不高明的，只是搬弄着一些报上常见的字眼，然而奇怪，那老太婆却听着不住地点头，嘴巴一张一闭的，挨近了她时，才听到是在念着：“那些孩子，那些孩子，要走了，要走了！”听完了我们一番演讲，她拍着手说：“你们就不知道呀，那些时，解放军还没来，我们那拴子（她的儿子）受的罪遭的苦，我担的惊受的怕哪。那些“遭殃军”连夜来抓兵，可怜我那拴子寒冬腊月，单布衣褂穿着上屋去躲着，冻出了病呀！家里眼睁睁就少吃没喝断了粮啦！……这日子是比吃“黄连”还苦啊！后来，总算巴天巴地，巴到解放军来了，人要宽畅病也好得快，不几天我那拴子也拉上车了，我们有吃有喝不用提，我母子两颗心也算是安放在胸膛了。拴子说这都是解放军的功劳，是共产党帮咱穷人翻了身，他拉车挣钱，从此不怕那些瘟军官坏警察拳打脚踢，晚上也好安心着意的睡个太平觉，这都是解放军解救了我母子两条命。他们要走，到江南去解救穷人去，快点呀，我穷人是知道穷人苦的，那边要有多少做娘的碎了心，在巴望着解放军去，啊呀同志们，幸亏你们来告诉一声，我不识字不识报的那里知道，我得送些东西慰劳他们。”
    她想了一下，说要去拿点东西，要我们等着她，就跑回屋里去了，好半天，她跑了出来，双手紧捏着一捧东西，十分不好意思地对我们说：“翻遍屋子实在没有什么东西，这是一双袜子，解放后儿子给我买的，送给解放军使得使不得呢？”说着双手摊了开来，一双折叠得好好的八九成新的深棕色的袜了平躺在她那双干枯的手上。我们都感动了，一片声嚷着：“要得呀，老大娘。”我暗暗叫着惭愧，看到了劳动人民的对自己子弟兵的热爱，那是我所不能想象的。
    又到了一家教授家里，主人不在家，一个老女佣听我们说明了要慰劳解放军时，她兴奋地对我们说开了：“对呀，解放军，我活了半辈子也没有见过这等好军队。前天我抱着孙女上城来，一路上碰到九个也进城来的解放军，他们见我走路显得有些累，就抢着把我孙女给抱过去了，那孩子也怪，在他们手里就乖乖的，他们抢着轮流抱，一直送我到家。真是我们亲子侄一样，一路上老大娘长老大娘短的。”我想，正就是她，恰恰道出了解放军和人民的关系，和人民对解放军的感情。她接着说：“送些什么好呢，我这贫老婆子什么也拿不出来，家里还指着我拿回去。送一盒洋火吧，千里送鹅毛，礼轻人意重，表表我这一番心。解放军也要生火，吃饭，抽烟，洋火用得着呢。”我禁不住大声叫出来：“谢谢您，老奶奶，您真替解放军想得周到。”今天我也上了一课。
