Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 11th: TASS reports: The Congress of the Communist Youth League of the Soviet Union concluded on the 8th in the Kremlin. At the closing session, Gorkin, Secretary of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, read the decree of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, awarding the All-Union Leninist Communist Youth League with the Order of Lenin. The Order of Lenin was personally awarded to Mikhailov by Svernik, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union.

　　Svernik then delivered a speech to the congress, stating: The Soviet government has successively commended the achievements of the Communist Youth League four times (Editor's note: The Youth League has received four major awards: the Order of the Red Banner of Combat, the Order of the Red Banner of Labor once each, and the Order of Lenin twice; this is the fifth time). These awards prove the enormous work that the Youth League, under the leadership of the Bolshevik Party, has already done in strengthening the Soviet socialist state. After recounting the glorious path taken by the Communist Youth League, Svernik stated: Now that the Soviet people are solving the great task of building communism, the role of the Youth League in educating young people is becoming increasingly important. The Bolshevik Party has defined the task of the Youth League as cultivating such warriors from among the youth: they must be fearless, vigilant, energetic, and confident; they must fight for the freedom and glory of our country, for the cause of the Lenin-Stalin Party, actively overcome any difficulties, and strive for the victory of communism. Svernik emphasized that building communism requires Youth League members to have comprehensive knowledge. Therefore, the basic task of the league's organizations at all levels is to educate young people and study the works of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin. The league must arm young people with the Leninist-Stalinist theory of communist victory, with the advanced scientific and technological knowledge of the Soviet Union, and the league must devote all its efforts to this cause. These things, combined with a communist attitude towards labor, will guarantee a continuous rise in labor productivity. Ultimately, this is the decisive factor in the victory of the communist system. Svernik concluded: Under the banner of Lenin and Stalin, the Soviet youth, together with the entire people, are confidently advancing towards the victory of communism. Long live the All-Union Leninist Communist Youth League - the strong helper of the Bolshevik Party!

　　In lasting and incessant jubilation, the congress unanimously passed a congratulatory telegram to Comrade Stalin, the great leader and teacher of the Soviet people. Mikhailov then announced the end of the congress agenda, and the 11th Congress of the Communist Youth League concluded.

　　苏联青年团荣膺列宁勋章
  　嘉奖团在国家建设方面的巨大成就
    【新华社北平十一日电】塔斯社讯：苏联共产主义青年团代表大会于八日在克里姆林宫闭幕。在闭幕会中最高苏维埃主席团秘书高尔金宣读苏联最高苏维埃主席团的命令，以列宁勋章授予全苏列宁共产主义青年团。列宁勋章由苏联最高苏维埃主席团主席斯维尔尼克亲手授予米哈依洛夫。
    斯维尔尼克随即向大会发表演说称：苏联政府已先后四次褒奖了共产主义青年团的功勋（编者按：青年团共得过四次重要褒奖，计战斗红旗勋章，劳动红旗勋章各一次，列宁勋章两次；这回是第五次）。这些褒奖证明，青年团在布尔什维克党的领导下，在加强苏维埃社会主义国家方面所已作的巨大的工作。斯维尔尼克在追述了共产主义青年团所经历的光辉道路之后称：现在苏维埃人民正在解决建设共产主义的伟大任务，青年团在教育青年方面的作用正越来越大。布尔什维克党规定了青年团的任务，是要从青年中间培养这样的战士：他们要是大无畏的、警觉的、有朝气的和自信的，他们要为我们国家的自由与光荣，为列宁斯大林党的事业而斗争，积极克服任何困难，争取共产主义的胜利。斯维尔尼克强调，建设共产主义需要青年团团员有全面的知识。因此，团的各级组织的基本任务，就是教育青年和研究马、恩、列、斯的著作。团必须用列宁—斯大林的共产主义胜利的学说，用苏联的进步的科学与技术知识来武装青年，团必须全力从事这个事业。这些东西和共产主义的劳动态度结合在一起，将保证劳动生产率不断上涨。归根结底，这是共产主义制度胜利的决定因素。斯维尔尼克最后称：在列宁、斯大林的旗帜下，苏维埃青年与全体人民一道，充满信心地向共产主义的胜利迈进。全苏列宁共产主义青年团——布尔什维克党的坚强助手万岁！
    在历久不息的欢腾中，大会一致通过致苏联人民的伟大的领袖与导师斯大林同志的贺电。米哈依洛夫至此宣布大会议程完毕，共产主义青年团第十一届代表大会闭幕。
