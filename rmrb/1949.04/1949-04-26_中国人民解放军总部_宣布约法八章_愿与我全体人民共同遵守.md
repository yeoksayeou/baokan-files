Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, April 25th: As the People's Liberation Army marches towards the southern and northwestern provinces, the headquarters of the People's Liberation Army today issued a proclamation, the full text of which is as follows:

Proclamation of the Chinese People's Liberation Army: The Kuomintang reactionaries have refused to accept the peace terms and persist in their anti-national and anti-people criminal war stance. The people of the whole country hope that the People's Liberation Army will quickly eliminate the Kuomintang reactionaries. We have ordered the People's Liberation Army to advance bravely, eliminate all Kuomintang reactionary troops who dare to resist, arrest all incorrigible war criminals, liberate the people of the whole country, defend the independence and integrity of China's territorial sovereignty, and realize the genuine peace and democratic unity that the people of the whole country yearn for. Wherever the People's Liberation Army arrives, we deeply hope that people from all walks of life will assist us. The following eight-point covenant is hereby announced. We are willing to abide by it together with all our people.

　　(1) Protect the lives and property of all the people. People from all walks of life, regardless of class, belief, or occupation, are expected to maintain order and adopt a cooperative attitude with the People's Liberation Army. The People's Liberation Army will adopt a cooperative attitude with people from all walks of life. If any counter-revolutionary elements or other saboteurs take the opportunity to create disturbances, rob, or destroy, they will be severely punished.

　　(2) Protect national industry, commerce, agriculture, and animal husbandry. All privately-owned factories, shops, banks, warehouses, ships, docks, farms, pastures, etc., shall be protected and shall not be infringed upon. It is hoped that employees in all industries will continue production as usual, and shops in all trades will continue business as usual.

　　(3) Confiscate bureaucratic capital. All factories, shops, banks, warehouses, ships, docks, railways, post offices, telegraphs, electric lights, telephones, waterworks, farms, pastures, etc., operated by the Kuomintang reactionary government and large bureaucratic elements shall be taken over by the People's Government. If private shares of national industrialists, merchants, farmers, and herdsmen are found to be true after investigation, their ownership shall be recognized. All personnel working in bureaucratic capital enterprises must continue to work as before before the People's Government takes over, and are responsible for protecting assets, machinery, charts, account books, archives, etc., pending inventory and takeover. Those who have made meritorious contributions to the protection will be rewarded, and those who slack off and sabotage will be punished. Those who are willing to continue to serve shall be allowed to be employed according to their talents after the People's Government takes over, so as not to become displaced.

　　(4) Protect all public and private schools, hospitals, cultural and educational institutions, sports venues, and all other public welfare undertakings. All personnel working in these institutions are expected to continue to work as usual. The People's Liberation Army shall protect them without infringement.

　　(5) Except for incorrigible war criminals and heinous counter-revolutionary elements, all officials of the Kuomintang central, provincial, municipal, and county governments, representatives to the National Assembly, members of the Legislative and Supervisory Yuan, senators, police personnel, and personnel of districts, towns, townships, and baojia, who do not resist with weapons or plot sabotage, shall not be taken as prisoners, arrested, or insulted by the People's Liberation Army and the People's Government. The above-mentioned personnel are instructed to remain at their posts, obey the orders of the People's Liberation Army and the People's Government, and be responsible for protecting the assets and archives of various institutions, pending acceptance and disposal. Among these personnel, those who have a skill and do not have serious reactionary behavior or serious bad deeds shall be selectively employed by the People's Government. Those who take the opportunity to sabotage, steal, commit fraud, abscond with public funds, public property, or archives, or refuse to hand over, shall be punished.

　　(6) In order to ensure urban and rural security and stabilize social order, all scattered soldiers and bandits should surrender and report to the local People's Liberation Army or the People's Government. Those who voluntarily surrender and report and hand over all their weapons will not be pursued. Those who resist reporting or hide weapons will be arrested and investigated. Those who harbor and fail to report will also be subject to appropriate punishment.

　　(7) The feudal land ownership system among peasants is unreasonable and should be abolished. However, the abolition of this system must be prepared and step-by-step. Generally speaking, rent reduction and interest reduction should be carried out first, followed by land distribution, and it will take a considerable period of time after the arrival and work of the People's Liberation Army before the land problem can be seriously solved. The peasant masses should organize themselves to assist the People's Liberation Army in carrying out various preliminary reforms; at the same time, they should work hard to cultivate the land so that the existing level of agricultural production will not be reduced, and then gradually improve it, so as to improve the lives of the peasants and supply the urban people with commercial grain. Urban land and houses cannot be treated in the same way as rural land problems.

　　(8) Protect the safety of life and property of foreign nationals. It is hoped that all foreign nationals will live and work in peace and maintain order. All foreign nationals must abide by the laws and decrees of the People's Liberation Army and the People's Government, and must not engage in espionage activities, must not have any behavior that opposes China's national independence and the people's liberation cause, and must not harbor Chinese war criminals, counter-revolutionary elements, and other criminals; otherwise, they will be subject to the legal sanctions of the People's Liberation Army and the People's Government.

The People's Liberation Army has strict discipline, public buying and selling, and is not allowed to take even a needle or a thread from the people. It is hoped that all our people will live and work in peace and contentment, and do not easily believe rumors and frighten each other. This is a must.

　　中国人民解放军总部
  　宣布约法八章
  　愿与我全体人民共同遵守
    【新华社北平二十五日电】随着人民解放军向南方及西北各省的进军，人民解放军总部本日颁发布告一件，全文如下：
    中国人民解放军布告：国民党反动派业已拒绝接受和平条件，坚持其反民族反人民的罪恶的战争立场。全国人民希望人民解放军迅速消灭国民党反动派。我们已命令人民解放军奋勇前进，消灭一切敢于抵抗的国民党反动军队，逮捕一切怙恶不悛的战争罪犯，解放全国人民、保卫中国领土主权的独立与完整，实现全国人民所渴望的真正的和平与民主的统一。人民解放军所到之处，深望各界人民予以协助。兹特宣布约法八章。愿与我全体人民共同遵守之。
    （一）保护全体人民的生命财产。各界人民，不分阶级信仰和职业，均望保持秩序，采取和人民解放军合作的态度，人民解放军则采取和各界人民合作的态度。如有反革命分子或其他破坏分子乘机捣乱，抢劫或破坏者，定予严办。
    （二）保护民族工商农牧业。凡属私人经营的工厂、商店、银行、仓库、船舶、码头、农场、牧场等，一律保护，不受侵犯。希望各业员工照常生产，各行商店照常营业。
    （三）没收官僚资本。凡属国民党反动政府及大官僚分子所经营的工厂、商店、银行、仓库、船舶、码头、铁路、邮政、电报、电灯、电话、自来水及农场、牧场等，均由人民政府接管，其中如有民族工商农牧业家私人股份经调查属实者，均承认其所有权。所有在官僚资本企业中供职的人员，在人民政府接管以前，均须照旧供职，并负责保护资财、机器、图表、帐册、档案等，听候清点和接管。保护有功者奖，怠工破坏者罚。凡愿继续服务者，在人民政府接管后，准予量才录用，不使流离失所。
    （四）保护一切公私学校、医院、文化教育机关、体育场所，及其他一切公益事业。凡在这些机关供职的人员，均望照常供职，人民解放军一律保护，不受侵犯。
    （五）除怙恶不悛的战争罪犯及罪大恶极的反革命分子外，凡属国民党中央、省、市、县各级政府的大小官员，国大代表，立法监察委员，参议员，警察人员，区镇乡保甲人员，凡不持枪抵抗、不阴谋破坏者，人民解放军及人民政府一律不加俘虏，不加逮捕，不加侮辱。责成上述人员各安职守，服从人民解放军及人民政府的命令，负责保护各机关资财、档案等，听候接收处理。这些人员中，凡有一技之长而无严重的反动行为或严重的劣迹者，人民政府准予分别录用。如有乘机破坏、偷盗、舞弊、携带公款、公物、档案潜逃，或拒不交代者，则须予以惩办。
    （六）为着确保城乡治安、安定社会秩序之目的，一切散兵游勇均应向当地人民解放军或人民政府投诚报到。凡自动投诚报到，并将所有武器交出者，概不追究。其有抗不报到或隐藏武器者，即予逮捕查究。窝藏不报者，亦须受相当的处分。
    （七）农民中的封建的土地所有权制度是不合理的，应当废除。但是废除这种制度必须是有准备和有步骤的。一般地说来，应当先行减租减息，后行分配土地，并且需要人民解放军到达和工作一个相当长的时期之后，方才谈得到认真地解决土地问题。农民群众应当组织起来，协助人民解放军进行各项初步的改革工作；同时努力耕种，使现有的农业生产水平不致降低，然后逐步加以提高，借以改善农民生活，并供给城市人民以商品粮食。城市的土地房屋不能和农村土地问题一样处理。
    （八）保护外国侨民生命财产的安全。希望一切外国侨民各安生业，保持秩序。一切外国侨民，必须遵守人民解放军及人民政府的法令，不得进行间谍活动，不得有反对中国民族独立事业及人民解放事业的行为，不得包庇中国战争罪犯、反革命分子及其他罪犯；否则，当受人民解放军及人民政府的法律制裁。
    人民解放军纪律严明，公买公卖，不许妄取民间一针一线。希望我全体人民，一律安居乐业，切勿轻信谣言，自相惊扰。切切此布。
