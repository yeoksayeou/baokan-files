Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, 19th. Democratic figures here have issued statements strongly protesting the unreasonable actions of the reactionary French government in restricting the entry of delegates to the World Congress of Supporters of Peace.

　　Li Jishen
　　Mr. Li Jishen, Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, said: "This unreasonable and despicable act of the French government fully proves that it is willing to be a tool of U.S. imperialism and an enemy of peace-loving people all over the world. We, the peace-loving people of China and the world, will not only not relax our efforts to oppose war and safeguard peace because of the obstruction and sabotage of the imperialists, but will further strive to fight the war-mongering imperialists and their running dogs, so that all their conspiracies to undermine peace will have no way to succeed."

　　He Xiangning
　　Ms. He Xiangning, Honorary Chairman of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation, said: "The reactionary French government's despicable means of restricting the entry of delegates to the World Congress of Supporters of Peace is aimed at undermining world peace. This World Congress of Supporters of Peace is a head-on blow to U.S. imperialism, so its first running dog in Western Europe, the reactionary French faction, came out to sabotage it. This is not only against a few delegates to the World Congress of Supporters of Peace, but against the people of the whole world, including the people of China. We firmly protest against this despicable act of the reactionary French government."

　　Shen Junru
　　Mr. Shen Junru, Standing Committee Member of the China Democratic League, said: "In addition to protesting this unreasonable action of the reactionary French government, which violates the public will of the whole world, we also hope that the French people, with their glorious revolutionary tradition, will rise up and correct this reactionary measure of the French government."

　　Huang Yanpei
　　Mr. Huang Yanpei, Standing Director of the China Democratic National Construction Association, believes: "The World Congress of Supporters of Peace is a very natural product of human psychology. Therefore, despite the obstruction of the reactionaries, this congress will continue to expand day by day, and will eventually cause the warmongers to collapse without a fight."

　　Tan Pingshan
　　Mr. Tan Pingshan, Chairman of the Chinese Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee, said: "China's elimination of the reactionary forces headed by Chiang Kai-shek is to seek true peace for China, which is consistent with the world people's demand for peace. Therefore, we protest against the French authorities' restriction on the entry of delegates from various countries to attend the Congress of Supporters of Peace."

　　Liu Yazi
　　Mr. Liu Yazi, a well-known figure in the cultural circles, said: "The French government's restriction on the entry of delegates to the World Congress of Supporters of Peace is an intentional attempt to undermine world peace, and we and the people of the world firmly oppose it."

　　Ma Xulun
　　Mr. Ma Xulun, Standing Director of the China Association for Promoting Democracy, said: "The French government's unreasonable actions cannot stop the development of the world's peace forces. The peace-loving people of the world unite and are strong enough to defeat the schemes of the war-mongers and achieve the liberation of all mankind and lasting peace."

　　Zhang Bojun
　　Mr. Zhang Bojun, Standing Committee Member of the China Democratic League, said: "The convening of the World Peace Congress represents the common demands of 2 billion people around the world. This powerful force demanding peace, if mobilized and organized, will surely be able to crush the North Atlantic Treaty Group."

　　Mao Dun
　　The famous revolutionary writer Mao Dun warned the international reactionary group: "The strength of the peace-loving people is now strong enough to stop the aggressive group headed by U.S. imperialism."

　　Zhang Naiqi
　　Mr. Zhang Naiqi, a democratic figure in the industrial sector and Standing Director of the China Democratic National Construction Association, believes that "the conclusion of the North Atlantic Treaty and the restriction of the reactionary French authorities on the entry of delegates to the World Congress of Supporters of Peace precisely show that imperialism is already afraid of the growing strength of the people."

　　Zhang Zhiran
　　University Professor Zhang Zhiran stated: "The French government, under the direction of U.S. imperialism, is restricting the entry of delegates to the Peace Congress of various countries, which is an act that violates the demands of human justice and should be severely protested."

　　Chen Qiyuan
　　Overseas Chinese democratic figure Chen Qiyuan criticized the French government's despicable actions and demanded that "the Chinese people and the people of the world unite as one and resolutely protest."

　　Shen Tilan
　　Mr. Shen Tilan of religious and educational circles believes: "The World Congress of Supporters of Peace is a demonstration by the world's democratic forces against the reactionary group of British and American imperialism. Therefore, it is impossible for the reactionary French government to attempt to restrict the development of the world's peaceful and democratic forces. The peaceful and democratic forces will overcome all obstacles and continue to grow stronger."

　　法国政府限制和平代表入境
  　民主人士一致抗议
    【新华社北平十九日电】此间民主人士对法国反动政府限制出席世界拥护和平大会代表入境一事发表谈话，提出严重抗议。
  　李济深
    中国国民党革命委员会主席李济深先生说：“法国政府这一无理而又卑鄙的行为，充分证明了它甘为美帝国主义的工具，而与全世界爱好和平的人民为敌。我中国以及全世界和平人民，不仅不会因帝国主义者之阻挠与破坏，而松懈我们反对战争和维护和平的努力，且将更进一步地努力与挑动战争的帝国主义者及其走狗搏斗，使他们的一切破坏和平的阴谋诡计，根本无所施其技。”
    何香凝
    中华全国民主妇女联合会名誉主席何香凝先生说：“法国反动政府用卑鄙的手段限制世界拥护和平大会代表入境，其目的就是要破坏世界和平。这次世界拥护和平大会是对美帝国主义的当头棒喝，所以它在西欧的第一个走狗法国反动派，就出来作破坏工作，这不单是反对几个拥护世界和平大会的代表的，而且是反对全世界人民的，也就是反对中国人民的。我们坚决抗议法国反动政府的这种卑鄙行为。”
    沈钧儒
    中国民主同盟常务委员沈钧儒先生说：“我们除了向法国反动政府这种违反全世界公意的无理行动表示抗议外，更希望有光荣革命传统的法兰西人民，起而纠正法国政府的这一反动措施。”
    黄炎培
    民主建国会常务理事黄炎培先生认为：“世界拥护和平大会是在人类心理中很自然地产生出来的。所以虽有反动派的阻挠，这个大会仍将一天一天扩大起来，最后会使好战者不战自溃。”
    谭平山
    中国国民党三民主义同志联合会主任委员谭平山先生说：“中国肃清以蒋介石为首的反动势力，是为了求得中国真正的和平。与世界人民和平要求是一致的。因此我们对法国当局限制各国参加拥护和平大会的代表入境一事提出抗议。”
    柳亚子
    文化界名流柳亚子先生说：“法国政府限制世界拥护和平大会的代表入境，这是有意破坏全世界的和平，我们和全世界人民都坚决反对。”
    马叙伦
    中国民主促进会常务理事马叙伦先生说：“法国政府这一无理行动，阻止不了全世界和平力量的发展。全世界爱好和平的人民联合起来，足够击破战争贩子的企图，而实现全人类的解放与永久的和平。”
    章伯钧
    中国民主同盟常务委员章伯钧先生说：“世界和平大会的召开，是代表全世界二十万万人民共同的要求。这个要求和平的强大力量，动员组织起来必然能粉碎北大西洋公约集团。”
    茅盾
    著名革命文学家茅盾先生警告国际的反动集团说：“和平人民的力量现在已经强大到足以制止美帝国主义为首的侵略集团了。”
    章乃器
    产业界民主人士民主建国会常务理事章乃器先生认为：“北大西洋公约的订立及法国反动当局限制世界拥护和平代表入境，正是表示了帝国主义已经惧怕人民力量的壮大。”
    张志让
    大学教授张志让先生表示：“法国政府竟受美帝国主义指使，限制各国和平大会代表入境，这是违反人类正义要求的举动，应严重抗议。”
    陈其瑗
    华侨民主人士陈其瑗先生指摘法国政府这种卑鄙行动，要求“中国人民和全世界人民团结一致，坚决抗议”。
    沈体兰
    宗教界和教育界沈体兰先生认为：“世界拥护和平大会，这是全世界民主力量向美英帝国主义反动集团的示威，所以法国反动政府企图限制世界和平民主力量的发展是不可能的，和平民主的力量将克服一切阻碍而继续壮大。”
