Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 19th: News has been confirmed: The French reactionary government has restricted the entry visas for representatives of the Chinese people attending the Paris Peace Congress to eight people. According to a Polish Press Agency report from Paris on the 18th: The Preparatory Committee of the World Congress of Supporters of Peace held a press conference regarding the French government's restrictions on issuing passports. The host of the press conference, Borel, used the French reactionary government's restriction on the entry of Chinese representatives as an example to emphasize the autocratic nature of the French government's decision. Borel said: After a journey of nine thousand kilometers, the Chinese delegation heard in Prague that thirty-two of them could not attend the conference. Speakers at the reception also included Soviet writer Fadeyev, Polish representative Bolischa, and French writer Aragon. They emphasized that the French government's measures could not deprive the congress of its enormous scale, nor could they quell the powerful voice of six hundred million people against war.

    大会筹委会招待记者严加斥责
    【新华社北平十九日电】消息证实：法国反动政府已将代表中国人民出席巴黎和平大会代表的入境签证限制为八人。据波兰通讯社巴黎十八日讯：世界拥护和平大会筹委会就法国政府限制签发护照事，举行记者招待会。招待会主持人鲍列尔以法国反动政府限制中国代表入境为例，着重指出法国政府这一决定的专横性质。鲍列尔说：中国代表团在经过九千公里的旅程后，在布拉格听到了他们有卅二人不能出席大会。在招待会上发言者尚有苏联作家法捷耶夫、波兰代表波利斯查、法国作家阿拉贡。他们强调说：法国政府这种措施，剥夺不了大会的巨大规模，也平息不了六亿人民反对战争的强大声音。
