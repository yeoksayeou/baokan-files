　　Startled Horse Causes Trouble
    ——A Short Story of Military-Civilian Relations
    Wei Xi
    On April 7th at 7:00 PM, Li Zhancheng, a communications soldier of the 41st Army, was riding a horse to deliver official documents. Because two vehicles behind him tried to overtake him, the horse was hit and startled, throwing the communications soldier off and running away. From Beigouyan to 60 West Street, it knocked down a nine-year-old child named Wang Ming, causing serious injuries. Afterwards, the Fourth Public Security Bureau detained the communications soldier and the horse. The child was sent to Peking University Hospital for emergency treatment. The 41st Army sent people to cooperate with the doctors for surgery overnight, but the child died before he could be transferred to the Army Hospital due to the severity of his injuries.

    On the afternoon of the 8th, a mass meeting was jointly held by the work group, the Public Security Bureau, and the 41st Army in the courtyard of No. 25 West Street. The representative of the 41st Army solemnly stated: The People's Liberation Army is an army of the people, and now it has caused a fatal accident. Although it was an accidental injury, the horse belongs to the army, and the army should be responsible. In addition to expressing apologies and self-criticism, they are willing to listen to the opinions of the family of the victim and all the compatriots present, and accept any punishment. The Public Security Bureau comrades reported on the investigation of this matter, and at the same time introduced the 41st Army's fully responsible and serious handling of this matter: They had already paid 11,000 yuan for medical expenses, bought a coffin worth more than 8,000 yuan, and sent 500 catties of sorghum to help the victim's family, as well as a large package of cakes, brown sugar, and white rice. This money was saved from the food expenses of all the comrades in the communications company.

    The mother of the deceased was both sad and moved. She said, "Of course I am sad that my child died; but I cannot blame that comrade, the horse is an animal, it turned around and ran, and he couldn't catch it!" The masses unanimously requested that this opinion be conveyed to the higher authorities, and that the communications soldier should not be blamed. An older sister-in-law said after the meeting: "If it were the Kuomintang army, even if they rode a horse and trampled ten or eight of you to death, they would just glare at you and that would be the end of it. You'd deserve it!"

　　惊马闯祸
    ——军民关系小故事
    韦曦
    四月七日下午七时，四十一军的通信员李占成骑马送公文，因后面两个车抢先，马被撞而惊跳，把通信员摔下来，脱疆飞跑。从北沟沿跑到西大街六十号，把王明的一个九岁小孩冲倒在地，受了重伤。事后第四公安分局把通信员连马一同扣留下来，小孩送北大医院急救，连夜四十一军派人协同大夫施行手术，终因伤势太重，还来不及转陆军医院便断气了。
    八日下午，由工作组、公安局、四十一军三方面联合在西大街二五号院内召开群众大会，四十一军的代表郑重表示：解放军是人民的军队，现在闯下人命大祸，虽是误伤，但马是军队的，军队应该负责。除表示歉意，痛自检讨外，愿意听取受难者的家属及各位到会同胞的意见，接受任何处分。公安局同志把关于这件事的调查做了报告后，同时介绍了四十一军完全负责认真处理这件事的经过：他们已出了一万一千元的医疗费，买了一口八千多元的棺材，送来了五百斤秫米救济受难者的家属，还有一大包蛋糕、红糖、白米。这笔钱是通讯连全体同志从伙食中节省出来的。
    死者的母亲又悲哀又感动，她说：“自己的小孩死了，当然伤心；可是不能怪那位同志，马是兽，它掉头跑了，他也追不上呀！”群众也一致要求把这意见转达上级，千万不要叫那位通信员担不是，一位大嫂子会后说：“要是国民党军队，就是骑在马上踩死你十个八个，瞪一下眼，就完了，算你活该！”
