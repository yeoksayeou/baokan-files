Xinhua News Agency, Yangtze River Front, 26th: The people of Yangzhong warmly welcomed the People's Liberation Army as they crossed the Yangtze River. This reporter crossed the river with the army on the afternoon of the 22nd. As the boat sailed into the river, we heard the sound of firecrackers on the opposite bank, and many people on the port's embankment waved to the PLA's boats. As soon as the PLA landed on the south bank, their first words were: "Congratulations, congratulations! We have been waiting for you for a long time." Many people ran from three or four *li* away to welcome them. A young farmer told the reporter: "This morning we were still hiding in the wheat fields. After lunch, we heard that you were here, that the Kuomintang had been defeated, and we rushed back to welcome you!" For dozens of *li* along the way, the people in the towns, villages, and at the crossroads lined the streets to welcome them, and tea was offered incessantly. Everywhere we could hear warm voices: "Comrades, you've worked hard, have some tea!" An old lady holding a bowl of tea wanted a PLA soldier to drink it, but it was a bit hot. Another old lady next to her brought over a bowl and said: "Comrade, drink from my bowl, my tea is not hot." Banners with "Long Live the People's Liberation Army!" and "Welcome the People's Liberation Army to Liberate South of the Yangtze River!" were plastered all over the walls of the villages and towns. The shops in towns like Gongxin Bridge were wide open and operating as usual. The people warmly poured out their hopes to the PLA and denounced the crimes of the Kuomintang bandit troops. A young farmer said: "Yangzhong is an old New Fourth Army guerrilla area. Yesterday, the Kuomintang was still deceiving us, saying that the Communists would kill people when they came, but no one paid attention to them. We are very clear in our hearts, we were originally one family!" Before being mostly annihilated by our army, the Kuomintang bandit troops set fire to civilian ships, burning two merchant ships and two steamships in Shagang. Farmer Wang Baode said: "If you hadn't come for another two days, every *bao* would have to produce thirteen strong men, and every family would have to hand over four big trees. I had already handed over two, but knowing you were coming soon, I stubbornly refused to hand over the other two!"

　　一片亲切的欢呼声！
　  扬中人民热烈欢迎解放军
    “恭喜恭喜，我们盼望很久了。”
    【新华社长江前线二十六日电】扬中人民热烈欢迎南渡长江的人民解放军。记者于二十二日下午随军南渡，船驶到江中，就听到对岸的鞭炮声，许多老百姓在港口的堤上向解放军的船只招手。解放军登上南岸，他们第一句话就是：“恭喜恭喜！我们盼望很久了。”很多人从三四里路外跑来欢迎，一个青年农民告诉记者：“今天上午我们还躲在麦田里，吃过中饭一听说你们来了，国民党打垮了，我们连忙跑回来欢迎你们！”进军数十里，沿途集镇上、村庄上的和路口上的人民夹道欢迎，茶水不绝。到处可听到亲切的声音：“同志、辛苦了、吃茶！”一个老大妈端着一碗茶要解放军战士喝，但烫了一些，旁边另一个老大妈又端了一碗上来说：“同志，喝我这杯，我的茶不烫。”“解放军万岁！”“欢迎解放军解放大江南！”的标语贴满各村镇的墙壁。公信桥等集镇都店门大开，照常营业，人民热情的向解放军倾诉他们的想望，并控诉国民党匪军的罪行。一个青年农民说：“扬中是新四军老游击地区，昨天国民党还欺骗我们说共产党来了要杀人，但谁也不理他，我们心里很明亮，我们原是一家人！”国民党匪军在被我大部歼灭前，曾放火焚烧民船，把沙港的两艘商轮和两只汽船烧了。农民王保德说：“你们要再过二天不来，每保就得出十三个壮丁，每家得缴四棵大树，我已经缴出两棵，知道你们快来了，还有两棵我硬拖着不交！”
