　　Adapting to New Circumstances
  　Organize the Transition from Handicraft Textile Industry as Early as Possible
    The development of the handicraft textile industry in rural North China played a significant role during the eight-year War of Resistance Against Japan and the three-year People's Liberation War. Under enemy blockade and division, it ensured military and civilian needs, and improved farmers' lives. Income from the textile industry gradually occupied a very important position in farmers' lives. According to known materials, in ordinary farm households in central and southern Hebei, textile income accounted for 15 to 32 percent of total income. Due to the victory of the People's Liberation War, the situation of blockade and division has been fundamentally changed. Today, we have cities and more concentrated large-scale industries. In areas adjacent to large cities, machine-made textiles have replaced hand-made textiles, making it impossible for hand-made textiles to be profitable. If we continue to use the old methods and do not pay attention to organizing the transition from hand-made textiles that can already be replaced by urban industries as early as possible, the damage to farmers' lives will be very great. The organization of people to promote the straw hat braid industry in Shangjialin Village, Xian County, is a very timely measure. All regions should study this experience and propose solutions as early as possible based on local conditions. This is also an important aspect of ensuring closer unity between urban and rural areas, and ensuring that farmers' lives are not harmed in situations where certain sideline businesses are not suitable for development today. Therefore, it should attract the attention of leading organs in various regions.

　　适应新的情况
  　及早组织手工纺织转业
    华北农村手工纺织业的发展，在八年的抗日战争与三年的人民解放战争中是起了极大作用的。在被敌人封锁与分割的情况下，保证了军需民用，改善了农民生活，纺织业的收入逐渐在农民生活中占着极重要的位置，据已知悉的材料，冀中、冀南两地普通农户中，纺织收入占总收入的百分之十五到三十二。由于人民解放战争的胜利，根本改变了封锁分割的情况，今天我们有了城市，而且有了较为集中的大工业，在邻近大城市，机器纺织代替了手工纺织，使手工纺织无法获利的地区，如果仍沿用旧方法，对于已经能为城市工业所代替的手工纺织还不注意及早组织转业，对于农民生活的损害是很大的。献县商家林村组织人民推广草帽辫业是一种非常适时的措施，各地应研究这一经验，并依据当地情况，及早提出办法。这点同样是保证城乡更加密切团结的一个重要方面，而且使农民生活不致在某些副业今天不宜发展的情况下受到损害，因此应引起各地领导机关的注意。
