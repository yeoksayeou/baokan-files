　　Twenty Jin of Rice
　　Bi
　　At two o'clock in the afternoon, the × unit of the People's Liberation Army was stationed in Daluo Village, Ji County. The village's grain and forage commissioner led Quartermaster Jiao of the Fifth Company to borrow twenty-one jin of horse feed and thirty jin of grass from Guo Laohan's house, equivalent to twenty jin of millet. Quartermaster Jiao returned to the quartermaster's office and, not having any small denomination grain coupons at the moment, immediately weighed out twenty jin of rice and sent it to Guo Laohan's house. He didn't even bother to wash his face before setting off to find housing in tomorrow's area of deployment.
　　The next day, before dawn, the assembly call "Di-di-da-da..." sounded, and the village was filled with the sound of gongs and drums sending off the troops. As the column was about to depart, the Fifth Company's commander and cultural officer went to the village committee to say goodbye.
　　"Fellow villagers! We've disturbed you. If the troops have behaved improperly or haven't returned borrowed items, please let us know!"
　　"Don't mention it! We're all one family, no need to be so polite. Our troops' discipline is truly excellent; if the village hasn't taken good care of you, please forgive us!"
　　The company commander gave the village cadres a smiling salute and turned to walk out. His eyes happened to fall on the notice board hanging on the west wall, which had a line written on it:
　　"Quartermaster Jiao borrowed twenty-one jin of horse feed and thirty jin of grass." He stopped.
　　"Has this debt been settled?"
　　"Don't worry about it! Quartermaster Jiao was in a hurry to leave, probably forgot? It's just a little, no need to repay it."
　　Su Xinmin, the director of the farmers' association, took the company commander's hand and saw him out of the village committee's gate. The column had already left the village, with only one squad remaining at the rear. The company commander waved his hand, calling them back.
　　"Quartermaster Jiao owes the village twenty jin of rice, can you all pool the rice from your bags?"
　　The soldiers immediately untied their marching rice bags. One went to find a cloth bag, and another went to the village office to get a scale. The director of the farmers' association tried to stop them, but how could he? After emptying nine soldiers' rice bags, they finally gathered twenty jin of rice. Everyone said a word of apology and ran to catch up with the column.
　　"Truly, not taking even a needle or thread from the people! Not taking even a needle or thread from the people!"
　　The director of the farmers' association carried the cloth bag back to the grain and forage section, muttering to himself.
　　At noon, the village committee received the rice and firewood coupons from the district, and the loudspeaker announced for each household to come and collect their share. They were busy until the sun began to set. All the households on the list had collected their shares, except for Guo Laohan, who hadn't come. The grain and forage commissioner carried the cloth bag back home. After dinner, he carried the twenty jin of rice on his back and delivered it to Guo Laohan's house.
　　"Old Guo, why didn't you come to collect your rice?"
　　"Look! Look! Shouldn't I collect it? What am I pretending to be?"
　　Guo Laohan thought he was joking.
　　"You're really getting senile, forgot? Yesterday afternoon, Quartermaster Jiao of the Fifth Company used your twenty jin of horse feed?"
　　"Quartermaster Jiao already returned it to me."
　　"How's that?" The grain and forage commissioner couldn't believe his ears, but he immediately understood what had happened:
　　"Oh no! Why didn't you say so earlier?" After complaining for a while, the grain and forage commissioner carried the twenty jin of rice back to the village committee. After hearing his report, everyone at the village committee complained:
　　"This is terrible! The company commander will criticize us when he gets back, and Quartermaster Jiao will be accused of violating discipline?"
　　"This, this is really making things difficult for Quartermaster Jiao, we've harmed him!"
　　Everyone was filled with remorse, as if they had a mouthful of chaff! Guo Laohan arrived, his beard trembling as if he had done something wrong; without saying a word, he picked up the rice bag and walked out.
　　"Where are you going?"
　　"I've let down our troops; I'm going to chase after them."
　　"Where are you going to chase them?"
　　"Can't you ask? If I don't hurry, they'll be even further away tomorrow!"
　　"I'll go! We can't just blame you, I was also being careless."
　　The grain and forage commissioner snatched the rice bag down and carried it on his shoulder; the director of the farmers' association saw him off, repeatedly urging him: "No matter what, you must find the troops! If you can't catch up today, chase them tomorrow, take enough provisions for a few days!"
　　At this time, the earth was enveloped in the vast twilight. The traces of vehicles and horses on the road were already indistinguishable; the southeast wind was blowing sand, making it difficult to open one's eyes. The moon was yellow and round, with a large halo around it. The grain and forage commissioner ran forward in one breath.
　　The troops departing from Daluo Village were stationed in Liuzhuang, south of Nangong City, that night. The company commander left on business and didn't return until almost midnight. The next morning, he got out of bed and stepped into the quartermaster's office. Quartermaster Jiao was packing his bedding.
　　"Old Jiao, make a self-criticism! Have you violated mass discipline?"
　　"...What's wrong?" Quartermaster Jiao didn't know what he was talking about.
　　"Hmph! Don't play dumb! The twenty-one jin of feed and thirty jin of grass borrowed in Daluo Village, have you returned them?"
　　"I thought it was something serious! I returned it to him at the time."
　　Quartermaster Jiao breathed a sigh of relief and continued packing his bedding. The company commander became angry!
　　"Returned it!? It wasn't you who returned it, was it! Comrade, are you going to be honest? We are the People's Liberation Army!"
　　"How could I be wrong? If I didn't return it, I'll accept punishment, I'm not worthy of being a revolutionary soldier!"
　　"Messenger! Call the cultural officer to prove it for him."
　　The two were red-faced and in a difficult situation, but the messenger led in a fellow villager covered in wind and sand, carrying a rice bag, his face smeared with dirt and sweat. He put down the rice bag and warmly grabbed the hands of the company commander and Quartermaster Jiao, still breathing heavily.
　　"Company Commander! Quartermaster Jiao! I'm sorry! I'm sorry..."
　　The company commander and Quartermaster Jiao were both startled, looking at the fellow villager with suspicion. The company commander recognized him first:
　　"Aren't you a village cadre from Daluo Village? Sixty li, you came so early? Sit down, sit down! Wash your face!"
　　"What's the rice bag for?" Quartermaster Jiao asked.
　　"Ai! It really worried me!... I ran all night to find you. Quartermaster Jiao was criticized, right! I'm really sorry, we were careless!"
　　In a few words, the misunderstanding was resolved, and smiles appeared on the faces of all three.

　　二十斤米
    璧
    下午两点钟，解放军×部在冀县大罗村宿营了。这村的粮秣委员，领着五连的焦股长，从郭老汉家借支了二十一斤马料，三十斤草，折合小米二十斤。焦股长回到事务处，一时没有零粮票，马上称出二十斤米，送到郭老汉家里。他脸也没顾得洗，就出发到明天的驻地去号房子了。
    第二天天还不明，集合号“的的答答……”的叫着，村里欢送的锣鼓响成一片，队伍就要出发了，五连的连长和文化干事到村委会去辞别。
    “老乡们！打搅你们了，队伍那里不好，或是借的东西没有还，请你们提出意见！”
    “那里话！一家人何必客气？咱们队伍的纪律真够一百一；村里照顾不好，请弟兄们多原谅！”
    连长笑眯眯的向村干部们行了一个敬礼，转身往外走，眼光偶然碰到西墙上挂的记事牌，写着一行字：
    “焦股长借支马料二十一斤，草三十斤。”他停下了。
    “这笔帐清了没有？”
    “提不着！焦股长出发的紧，忘了吧？这一点点，不用还了。”
    农会主任苏心民拉着连长的手，送出村委会的大门，队伍已经出了村，只剩下一个班还在后边，连长摆着手叫他们回来。
    “焦股长欠村里二十斤米，你们身上的米袋凑一下吧？”
    战士们一齐把行军米袋解下来，一个去找布袋，另一个到村办公处拿秤，农会主任拦这个抓那个，那里抓拦得住？倒空了九个人的米袋，才凑足了二十斤米，大家说了句道歉的话，跑步追队去了。
    “真是秋毫无犯！秋毫无犯！”
    农会主任提着布袋回到粮秣股，嘴里还在嘟囔着。
    晌午，村委会把米柴票从区里领来了米，广播筒叫喊着要各户来领，一直忙到日头偏西，帐单上各花户都领去了，就只差郭老汉没有来，粮秣委员把布袋背回屋，吃过晚饭，他自个背着二十斤米，送到郭老汉家里。
    “老郭，为什么不去领米？”
    “看！看！我不该领，还能冒充？”
    郭老汉以为他在开玩笑。
    “真是老晕了，忘啦昨儿过晌，五连焦股长用的你那二十斤马料？”
    “焦股长早已还我了。”
    “怎么说？”粮秣委员不相信自己的耳朵，但是他马上明白了这是怎么回事：
    “糟了！你怎不早说？”抱怨了一阵，粮秣委员又把二十斤米扛回村委会去。村委会听了他的回报，大家埋怨道：
    “可糟透了！连长回去还不批评，焦股长犯纪律？”
    “这，真叫焦股长有口难诉呀，是咱害了人家了！”
    你一言我一语，大家心里都象塞了一把糠！郭老汉赶来了，胡子抖索索的象是办了什么亏心事；一句话没说，他背起米袋子就往外走，
    “干么去？”
    “我对不住咱的队伍；我去撵他们。”
    “你往那里撵？”
    “不会问吗？不趁早追，明天走得更远了！”
    “我去吧！不能光怨你，我也粗鲁啦”
    粮秣委员把米袋夺下来，扛在自己肩上；农会主任送他往外走着，还再三再四的叮嘱：“无论如何要找着队伍啊！今天追不上，明天再追，多带几天盘用！”
    这时大地沉在苍茫的暮色里，路上车马的痕迹已辨不清了；顶头的东南风卷着飞沙，打得人睁不开眼，月亮黄澄澄的，挂着一个大风圈，粮秣委员一口气的往前小跑。
    从大罗村出发的队伍，当晚驻在南宫城南刘庄，连长因事出发，快半夜了才回来。次日清早他从床上爬起来，一脚跨进事务处的房子，焦股长正在打被包。
    “老焦，检讨检讨吧！犯群众纪律没有？”
    “……怎么啦？”焦股长不知从从何说起了。
    “哼！别装傻啦！在大罗村借的二十一斤料，三十斤草，还了没有？”
    “我当是什么事！那当时就还他了。”
    焦股长松了一口气似的，又忙着整理他的被包，连长发了火！
    “还了！？不是你还的吧！同志，坦白吗？咱们是人民解放军啊！”
    “那里能错？如若没有还，我受处份，我不配当革命军人！”
    “通讯员！叫文化干事来给他证明。”
    两人面红耳赤，正在难解难分，通讯员却领着一个满身风沙的老乡进来，背着一个米袋，脸上涂满横三竖四的呢污和汗流。他一边放下米袋，一边亲切的抓住了连长和焦股长的手，还在呼呼的喘大气。
    “连长！焦股长！对不住！对不住……”
    连长和焦股长都猛地一怔，惊疑的打量着这个老乡，还是连长眼亮，先认了出来：
    “你不是大罗村的村干部吗？六十多里路，来得这样早？坐下，坐下！洗洗脸吧！”
    “米袋子，做什么的？”焦股长问。
    “嗨！可没把我急坏！……直跑了一夜，才找着您。焦股长受批评了吧！真对不起，我们粗心！”
    三言两语，这个疙瘩就解开了，三个人的脸上都露出了会心的笑容。
