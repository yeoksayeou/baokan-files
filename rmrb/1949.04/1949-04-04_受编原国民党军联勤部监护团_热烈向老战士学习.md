[This City News] The former Kuomintang Army Joint Logistics Command Fifth Supply Area Monitoring Regiment, after being reorganized into the People's Liberation Army, has made preliminary progress in political awareness and is eagerly learning from veteran PLA soldiers. A certain unit of the PLA, in its assistance to the regiment, first adopted the method of giving large lectures, explaining the differences between the two classes and two armies in China, as well as their styles and systems, clarifying the PLA's three major democracies (military, political, and economic), and pointing out the issue of "for whom to serve." Then, seminars and discussions were held in squads and platoons. Due to the PLA Soldiers' Committee comrades' skill in guiding and the eager demands of the subordinate troops' soldiers, the discussions quickly turned from being relatively quiet at the beginning to being very enthusiastic. On the fourth day of learning, the soldiers automatically established a Soldiers' Committee to ensure learning, and their enthusiasm was very high. They immediately published wall newspapers, proposing opposition to the beating and scolding system and corruption phenomena in the old army. Before the establishment of the Soldiers' Committee, mobilization was carried out in the companies, and each squad discussed the qualifications of the Soldiers' Committee members, with each squad nominating two candidates. After a democratic election by the soldiers' congress, activists were elected. After the establishment of the Soldiers' Committee, the members automatically convened meetings every day, inviting the instructors to participate and arrange work. Although there was no Communist Party branch in the company yet, all work was guaranteed to be carried out through the Soldiers' Committee. The leadership boldly let go, constantly encouraging their enthusiasm, enhancing their prestige, and timely participating and providing specific assistance, so the Soldiers' Committee became the core of the company, playing a significant role in ensuring learning. The cadres sent by the PLA to the regiment received the soldiers' utmost respect and love, and were called "our instructors." In political study, mutual visits were also organized, and the PLA sent personnel to the subordinate troops to express condolences. In conversations, the soldiers of the monitoring regiment expressed great admiration for the veterans who had performed meritorious services and been promoted to cadres. Because they were familiar with the PLA's life and style, they asked to go to the old units to study and work.

　　受编原国民党军联勤部监护团　热烈向老战士学习
    【本市讯】原国民党军联合后勤司令部第五补给区监护团改编为人民解放军后，政治觉悟初步提高，热烈向解放军老战士学习，解放军某部对该部的帮助，首先采取上大课的方式，讲解中国的两个阶级两种军队，及其作风和制度的不同，说明解放军的军事、政治、经济三大民主，指出“为谁当兵”的问题。然后在班排中举行座谈、讨论。由于解放军士兵委员会的同志们善于引导，和受编部队的士兵们的迫切要求，讨论由开始时的比较沉静迅速转为热烈，当学习后的第四天，战士们即自动的成立了士兵委员会来保证学习，情绪非常高涨，并立即出版墙报，提出反对旧军队中的打骂制度与贪污现象。成立士委会之前，在连队中曾进行了动员，各班讨论了士委会委员的条件，由每班推出两个候选人，经过军人大会民主选举，因而积极分子都被选出。建立了士委会之后，委员们每天自动召开会议，并邀请指导员参加，布置工作。虽然连队中尚没有共产党支部，但一切工作通过士委会保证执行，领导上大胆放手，不断鼓励其情绪，提高其威信，及时参加并给予具体的帮助，士委会就成了连队的核心，对保证学习发挥了很大作用。解放军派到该团的干部，则获得士兵们极高的崇敬和爱戴，称呼为“我们的指导员”。在政治学习中，又组织了相互参观，解放军并派遣人员到受编部队进行慰问，在交谈中，监护团的士兵们，对于解放来的战士立功和升为干部的，表示非常钦佩。他们由于熟悉了解放军的生活和作风，纷纷要求到老部队学习和工作。
