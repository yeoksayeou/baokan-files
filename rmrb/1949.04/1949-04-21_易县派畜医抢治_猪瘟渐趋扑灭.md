　　Yi County Dispatches Veterinarians for Emergency Treatment; Swine Fever Gradually Being Suppressed

　　[Chahar News] The Party and government leaders of the second, fourth, and eleventh districts of Yi County initially displayed an indifferent, bureaucratic attitude toward the serious swine fever that occurred in their areas, leading to the spread and expansion of the disease and causing significant losses. Swine fever in the aforementioned districts had been occurring since January, but due to the failure to actively prevent and control it, and the indiscriminate sale of dead pig meat and infected pigs at markets, the disease quickly spread to the third and fourth districts as well. According to statistics from more than twenty villages, over two hundred pigs had died; in Beibaihong Village in the second district alone, more than sixty pigs died in two months. After the county discovered this situation, in addition to immediately contacting the Xiling Farm to quickly dispatch veterinarians to villages such as Beibaihong and Xiaonantou to inject cholera serum, inspection teams were organized at various markets in the epidemic area to prohibit the sale of sick pigs; some folk remedies were also introduced, and prevention methods were publicized. After the concentrated prevention and control efforts, the swine fever has gradually been suppressed. (Jiao Ye, Shu Chun)

　　易县派畜医抢治
  　猪瘟渐趋扑灭
    【察哈尔讯】易县二、四、十一区的党政领导干部对该地区所发生的严重猪瘟，初时表现了漠不关心的官僚主义态度，致猪瘟蔓延扩大，造成很大损失。上述各该区猪瘟从一月份就已发生，但因未能积极防治，而且死猪肉及瘟猪随便在集上出卖，所以猪瘟很快在三、四区也蔓延起来，据二十余村统计已死猪二百多口，仅二区北白虹村两个月中死猪六十多口。此事经县发觉后，除立即向西陵农场接洽，迅速派兽医到北白虹、小南头等村注射霍乱血清外，同时在疫区各集上组织检查组禁止病猪上市；并介绍了一些土方治疗法，和宣传了预防法。经突击防治后，猪瘟已渐趋扑灭。　　　　　　　　　　（焦野、树椿）
