Small Suggestion:

　　Earnestly Plant Trees and Create Forests
    Every year, Beiping shouts about planting trees and creating forests. When Qingming Festival arrives, the children also get some willow branches and plant them in the ground to join in the fun. But in the past, Beiping's tree planting was nominal: every year, the seasonal reports stated that the city would plant ×10,000 trees that year; then, one would see sanitation workers digging pits along roadsides everywhere. After a few days, thousands upon thousands of saplings would be planted in the pits, and one would often see people watering them. But after a while, not only did they not sprout or grow leaves, but they completely withered. The sanitation workers would then, in the order of the pits they dug, haul away these dry branches by cart. Year after year, it was the same, so Beiping's trees were planted less and less, only adding a lot of meaningless trouble to the sanitation workers. Today's Beiping is no longer the dark ages, and corrupt officials cannot get away with things. Yesterday, I saw that the streets in the city were dug up again, preparing to plant trees. I specifically suggest to the People's Government: (1) Do not buy tree seedlings that cannot survive in order to save money. (2) Adopt a fixed responsibility system, designating a certain tree merchant and a certain government handler to plant a certain number of trees on a certain street; stipulate competition, reward, and punishment methods. (3) Planting trees and watering should be done by the merchants, to avoid adding extra labor to the sanitation workers. (4) The number of trees planted should be reduced. Don't be greedy, but plant one and have it live, so as not to waste meaninglessly.

### 认真植树造林

　　认真植树造林
    北平每年呐喊植树造林，到了清明节，小孩子们也要弄些柳枝栽到地上凑热闹。但过去北平植树是有名无实：每年清明节应时的报导是本市本年要植树×万株；继而便见到清洁夫们在各处道路两旁掘坑，再过几天便成千成万的树苗按坑栽下，也常常看到有人浇水，可是过一个时间，不但没有生芽长叶，却完全枯干了，还是清洁夫们按掘坑次序再把这干柴用车拉去。年复一年，都是这样，所以北平的树是越植越少，只是给清洁夫老哥们添了许多无味的麻烦。今天的北平不是黑暗时代了，贪官污吏吃不开了。昨天我见到市内各街道又掘开了栽树坑，准备栽树。我特向人民政府建议：（一）不要为省钱而买不能活的树苗。（二）采取固定负责制，指定某树商政府某经手人在某街植树若干株；规定比赛与奖惩办法。（三）栽树浇水要商人动手，以免清洁夫增加额外劳动。（四）栽植数目要减低。不贪多，要栽一株活一株，免得无味消耗。
