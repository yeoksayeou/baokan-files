Xinhua News Agency, Yangtze River Front, April 28th: (Delayed dispatch) A major annihilation battle is underway on the Jiangnan front. The Kuomintang troops retreating south from the Nanjing, Zhenjiang, and Wuhu areas along the Beijing-Hangzhou National Highway and its sides, including the 51st Army, 4th Army, 28th Army, 45th Army, 99th Army, 66th Army, and 20th Army, have been routed after six days of fierce pursuit by the People's Liberation Army. Over 40,000 have been captured so far. On the 26th and 27th, the People's Liberation Army liberated Changxing and Wuxing, two county towns in southwestern Taihu Lake in Zhejiang Province. By this point, the majority of the fleeing enemy's seven armies had been intercepted and surrounded by the People's Liberation Army in the area north of the Changxing-Guangde-Langxi line and are now being fiercely annihilated. As the utterly defeated enemy fled south in panic, they collapsed at the slightest touch. On the 26th, near Yixing, a unit of the People's Liberation Army annihilated two regiments of the enemy's 51st Army with just one regiment, suffering only one lightly wounded soldier.

Xinhua News Agency, Yangtze River Front, April 28th: (Delayed dispatch) The People's Liberation Army, crossing the Beijing-Shanghai Railway, advanced rapidly in the rain, attacking the Kuomintang bandit troops fleeing south from the Nanjing, Yangzhou, and Zhenjiang line. The enemy in Yangzhou, disregarding the Kuomintang troops on the north bank, burned more than 70 civilian boats and fled. A large number of bandits on the north bank threw their weapons into the river and fled in all directions. Some tried to swim south and drowned in the middle of the river. Along the Beijing-Hangzhou National Highway and the highways of Yangzhou, Danyang, Zhenjiang, and Liyang, scattered soldiers were everywhere, lacking clothes, hats, and shoes, and empty-handed. Abandoned weapons, ammunition, vehicles, party badges, broken shoes, torn hats, and ripped cotton wads littered the roadside. The fleeing bandit troops looted, set fires, conscripted soldiers, and grabbed laborers along the way. If they couldn't find men, they would grab women. Wherever the People's Liberation Army pursuit troops arrived, people who had fled returned from the fields and recounted the crimes of the bandit troops to the People's Liberation Army. Women wept and begged the People's Liberation Army to hurry and rescue their husbands. Farmers in various places voluntarily contributed grain and grass to support the pursuing troops. People in the Danyang area planted red flags, made three months ago, on the streets to welcome them. Greatly encouraged by the enthusiasm of the people in the newly liberated areas, the morale of the People's Liberation Army was exceptionally high. Disregarding hunger and fatigue, a unit advanced in the rain on muddy mountain roads, appearing suddenly on the Jurong-Liyang highway at a speed of 130 li per day, cutting off the fleeing enemy, capturing more than 2,600 enemy soldiers and two mountain guns. The bandits, who were warming themselves and drying their clothes in the houses, obediently came out as prisoners upon hearing the gunfire.

　　江南前线解放长兴吴兴
  　匪七个军被围
  　我俘敌四万刻正聚歼
    【新华社长江前线二十八日电】迟到：江南前线一个大歼灭战正在进行中。由南京、镇江、芜湖地区沿京杭国道及其两侧向南败退的国民党军五十一军、第四军、二十八军、四十五军、九十九军、六十六军、二十军等部，经各路解放军猛追六天，溃不成军，已先后被俘达四万余人。二十六日、二十七日两日，解放军解放太湖西南浙江省的长兴、吴兴两座县城。至此，逃敌七个军之大部均已被解放军截住并包围于长兴、广德、郎溪一线以北地区之内，正被猛烈聚歼。当狼狈不堪的敌人向南逃窜时，惊惶失措，一触即溃，解放军某部二十六日在宜兴附近，仅以一个团的兵力，即歼灭敌五十一军两团之众，而解放军仅轻伤一人。
    【新华社长江前线二十八日电】迟到：横越京沪铁路的人民解放军冒雨疾进，进击由南京、扬中、镇江一线向南溃逃的国民党匪军。扬中敌不顾北岸的国民党部队，烧毁了七十余只民船逃窜，北岸的大批匪徒就都把武器扔到江中四散逃亡，有的泅水南逃在江心淹死。在京杭国道与扬中，丹阳，镇江，溧阳的公路上，到处是缺衣，缺帽，缺鞋和空着手的散兵，沿途遗弃着国民党匪军的武器、弹药、汽车、党徽、破鞋、烂帽，和撕破的棉花套。抱头鼠窜的匪军沿途抢掠、放火、拉军、抓夫，抓不到男人就抓妇女。解放军追击部队所到之处，外出逃避的人民纷纷从四野返回家里，向解放军控诉匪军罪行，妇女们哭着请求解放军赶快追上去救回她们的丈夫。各地农民都自动献出粮草支援追击部队。丹阳一带人民把三个月以前就已制好的红旗插在街上欢迎。在新区广大人民的热情鼓舞下，解放军士气格外奋发，某部不顾饥饿疲劳在泥泞山路上冒雨前进，以日行一百三十里的速度突然出现在句容——溧阳公路上，将逃敌拦腰截断，俘获敌军二千六百多名和山炮二门，正在屋子里烤火烘衣的匪徒们，一闻枪声便驯服地出来当俘虏。
