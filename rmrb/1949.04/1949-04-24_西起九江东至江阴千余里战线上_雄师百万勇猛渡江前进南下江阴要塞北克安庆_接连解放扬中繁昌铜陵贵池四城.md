Xinhua News Agency, Yangtze River Front, 2200 hours, April 22nd: The People's Liberation Army's million-strong army, breaking through enemy lines from a front of over a thousand li, is crossing the Yangtze River. From west of Jiujiang (excluding Jiujiang) to east of Jiangyin, all are within the People's Liberation Army's river-crossing area. Starting on the night of the 20th, the Central Route Army of the People's Liberation Army on the north bank of the Yangtze River first broke through the Anqing-Wuhu line and crossed to the areas of Fanchang, Tongling, Qingyang, Digang, and Lugang. Within twenty-four hours, 300,000 troops had crossed. Starting at 5:00 PM on the 21st, our Western Route Army began crossing the river, at the Jiujiang-Anqing section. As of the time of this dispatch, two-thirds of the 350,000 troops of this route had crossed, and the remainder will cross on the 23rd. This route has now occupied the vast southern bank positions along the line of Guichi, Yinjiahui, Dongliu, Zhide, and Pengze, and is expanding southward. Like the enemy situation encountered by the Central Route Army, the enemy facing our Western Route Army is also collapsing and retreating, lacking any fighting spirit. The resistance encountered by our army is very weak. This situation is partly due to the People's Liberation Army being brave and good at fighting, and unstoppable; on the other hand, it is closely related to the Kuomintang reactionaries' refusal to sign the peace agreement. The vast majority of Kuomintang officers and soldiers unanimously hope for peace and do not want to fight anymore. Hearing that Nanjing rejected peace, they were very discouraged. War criminal Tang Enbo went to Wuhu on the 21st to supervise the battle, but it had no effect. Tang Enbo believed that the Nanjing-Jiangyin section of the defense line was very solid, and the weakness only existed in the Nanjing-Jiujiang line. Unexpectedly, on the very day Tang Enbo arrived in Wuhu, the eastern defense line was broken through by our army again. Our Eastern Route Army of 350,000 troops launched the river-crossing operation on the same day and at the same time as the Western Route. All planned goals have been achieved. As of the time of this dispatch, the majority of our Eastern Route armies have crossed to the south bank, and the remainder can cross on the 23rd. The enemy resistance here was relatively stubborn, but in the whole day of fierce fighting from the afternoon of the 21st to the afternoon of the 22nd, we have annihilated and defeated all resisting enemies, occupied vast areas of Yangzhong, Zhenjiang, and Jiangyin counties, and controlled the Jiangyin Fortress, blockading the Yangtze River. Our vanguard has already cut off the Zhenjiang-Wuxi railway line.

Xinhua News Agency, Yangtze River Front, April 23rd: The Eastern Route People's Liberation Army, which crossed the Yangtze River, liberated Jiangyin County, a military stronghold in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, on the afternoon of the 22nd. At the same time, the Central Route People's Liberation Army captured Anqing County, the remaining strong stronghold of the Kuomintang bandit army on the north bank of the Yangtze River, annihilating part of the enemy.

Xinhua News Agency, Yangtze River Front, April 23rd: The million-strong army of the People's Liberation Army, victoriously crossing the Yangtze River, is developing rapidly towards the southern bank in all directions. By noon on the 22nd, it had captured Jiangyin Fortress and the four county towns of Yangzhong, Fanchang, Tongling, and Guichi, as well as the vast area along the entire southern bank of the river. The Eastern Route Liberation Army, crossing the river on the Yizheng-Nantong line, crossed about 300,000 people in one night, from the evening of the 21st to dawn on the 22nd. During the river crossing, thousands of artillery pieces of the Liberation Army on the north bank simultaneously bombarded the south bank, and the artillery fire reddened the entire river surface. The Kuomintang bandit army's positions on the south bank were destroyed and retreated in a panic. The Liberation Army, which landed in Yangzhong, captured Yangzhong County on the afternoon of the 22nd. The Liberation Army, which landed north of Changzhou, completely occupied the Ligang-Taohuagang line on the morning of the 22nd, and eliminated more than a thousand enemy troops defending Baizhangling, and then advanced rapidly to the south, cutting off the Beijing-Shanghai Road. When the Liberation Army launched a large-scale landing, the enemy guarding along the river were frightened and at a loss. The Liberation Army seized more than twenty mountain guns, heavy guns, and howitzers that the enemy had not yet deployed. The Liberation Army, which landed near Jiangyin, completely occupied the famous and important Jiangyin Fortress on the afternoon of the 22nd, and completely controlled the vast area on both sides of Jiangyin. In addition to the fortress, the Liberation Army captured thirty to forty various artillery pieces. The Central Route Liberation Army, which first crossed the river between Wuhu and Anqing on the afternoon of the 20th, divided its forces and quickly developed in depth after crossing the Yangtze River along the entire line. On the afternoon of the 21st, it captured the two cities of Fanchang and Tongling in succession. On the afternoon of the 22nd, it captured Guichi County and the surrounding key points such as Shangxia Jiangkou, Yuji Coal Mine, Huxingshan, and Meizi, and immediately advanced towards Qingyang. According to confirmed information, the Liberation Army annihilated parts of the enemy's 55th Army and 88th Army in the Central Route River-Crossing Operation, captured more than 3,000 enemy troops including Song Mao, the deputy commander of the 149th Division, and seized a gunboat. The Western Route Liberation Army, which crossed the river from Guichi to Pengze, had occupied 200 li of the southern bank's coastal positions on the 22nd. The Liberation Army, which crossed the river east of Madang, occupied key points such as Huangshan and Xiangkou and developed in depth. When the troops crossed the river, all the commanders and fighters were extremely excited. When a certain unit boarded the ship, military music played in unison. When the departure signal sounded, each ship sped off like an arrow, reaching the south bank in just eight to eighteen minutes. The first units to arrive successively sent out landing signals and raised a large red flag embroidered with "Cross the Yangtze River and Liberate All of China."

　　西起九江东至江阴千余里战线上
    雄师百万勇猛渡江前进南下江阴要塞北克安庆
    接连解放扬中繁昌铜陵贵池四城
    【新华社长江前线二十二日二十二时电】人民解放军百万大军，从一千余华里的战线上，冲破敌阵，横渡长江。西起九江（不含），东至江阴，均是人民解放军的渡江区域。二十日夜起，长江北岸人民解放军中路军首先突破安庆、芜湖线，渡至繁昌、铜陵、青阳、荻港、鲁港地区。二十四小时内即已渡过三十万人。二十一日下午五时起，我西路军开始渡江，地点在九江、安庆段。至发电时止，该路三十五万人民解放军已渡过三分之二，余部二十三日可渡完。这一路现已占领贵池、殷家汇、东流、至德、彭泽之线的广大南岸阵地，正向南扩展中。和中路军所遇敌情一样，我西路军当面之敌亦纷纷溃退，毫无斗志，我军所遇之抵抗，甚为微弱，此种情况，一方面由于人民解放军英勇善战，锐不可当；另一方面，这和国民党反动派拒绝签订和平协定，有很大关系。国民党的广大官兵一致希望和平，不想再打了，听见南京拒绝和平，都很泄气。战犯汤恩伯二十一日到芜湖督战，不起丝毫作用。汤恩伯认为南京江阴段防线是很巩固的，弱点只存在于南京九江一线。不料正是汤恩伯到芜湖的那一天，东面防线又被我军突破了。我东路三十五万大军与西路同日同时发起渡江作战。所有预定计划，都已实现。至发电时止，我东路各军已大部渡过南岸，余部二十三日可以渡完。此处敌军抵抗较为顽强，然在二十一日下午至二十二日下午的整天激战中，我已歼灭及击溃一切抵抗之敌，占领扬中，镇江，江阴诸县的广大地区，并控制江阴要塞，封锁长江。我军前锋，业已切断镇江无锡段铁路线。
    【新华社长江前线二十三日电】横渡长江的东路人民解放军二十二日下午解放长江下游军事重镇江阴县城。同时，中路人民解放军攻克长江北岸国民党匪军残剩的强固据点安庆县城，歼敌一部。
    【新华社长江前线二十三日电】胜利横渡长江的人民解放军百万大军，全线向南岸纵深猛烈发展，至二十二日中午，已攻克江阴要塞和扬中、繁昌、铜陵、贵池四座县城和南岸全线沿江广阔地区。在仪征至南通一线渡江的东路解放军，在二十一日晚至二十二日拂晓，一夜间就渡过了约三十万人。渡江时，北岸解放军的成千门大炮同时向南岸猛烈轰击，炮火映红了整个江面。国民党匪军南岸阵地纷纷被毁，狼狈溃退，在扬中登陆的解放军二十二日中午攻克扬中县城。在常州以北登陆的解放军二十二日晨完全占领利港至桃花港一线，并消灭百丈岭守敌千余人，继即向南猛进，切断京沪路。当解放军大举登陆时，沿江守敌怆惶失措，解放军一举缴获敌未及展开的山炮、重炮、榴弹炮共二十余门。在江阴附近登陆的解放军二十二日下午完全占领著名险要的江阴要塞，并完全控制江阴东西两侧广阔地区。除要塞外，解放军共缴获各种大炮三四十门。二十日下午首先由芜湖至安庆间渡江的中路解放军，在全线越过长江后，即分路迅速向纵深发展。二十一日下午，连克繁昌、铜陵两城，二十二日午又攻克贵池县城及其周围的上下江口、裕记煤矿、虎形山、梅梓等要点，并即向青阳猛进。据已查明者，解放军在中路渡江作战中共歼灭敌五十五军、八十八军等各一部，俘虏敌一四九师副师长宋茂以下三千余人，并缴获炮舰一艇。自贵池至彭泽间渡江的西路解放军，二十二日已占领南岸沿江二百里阵地，自马当以东渡江的解放军攻占黄山、香口等要点，并向纵深发展。当各部渡江时，全体指战员莫不兴奋非常。某部登船时，军乐齐鸣，出发信号起时，各船如箭飞驶，仅经八分至十八分钟即抵达南岸。首先到达的各部，纷纷发出登陆信号，并扬起绣着“打过长江去，解放全中国”的大红旗。
