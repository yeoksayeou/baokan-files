China People's Liberation Army Southbound Work Group
Continued Enrollment Notice

Now that the domestic peace agreement has been rejected by the reactionary Kuomintang government and our People's Liberation Army of millions has crossed the Yangtze River, the capital of the reactionary Kuomintang government, Nanjing, has also been liberated by our army. Other cities will become the property of the people as soon as our army arrives. The mission of this group to go south to carry out takeover work is becoming increasingly urgent. In addition to stepping up the completion of the education plan for existing members in order to set off in advance, in order to take care of the recent requests of many young students to participate in the southbound work and in view of the rapid progress of the People's Liberation Army, more personnel are bound to be needed for the work, so it has been decided to publish another recruitment advertisement. Anyone who is determined to participate in the southbound takeover work in this great victorious revolutionary struggle and meets the requirements of the brief recruitment announcement previously published by this group can directly register at the following locations and take the exam at any time. This announcement.
