　　"I Want to Compete with You in Performing Meritorious Service!"
    Yang Lei Xu Ru
    After supper on the tenth, a unit of our army was about to start a game, and the troops were assembled on the playground. The clerk took a letter and said, "Everyone listen to me read a letter! I won't say who this letter is for yet. But this letter is from Xinglong!" The comrades from Xinglong's hearts beat faster, hoping this letter was for them. The clerk read: ×× son:
    I received your letter. You are fighting in the army for the liberation of the people, and you have fought throughout the entire Northeast and eastern Hebei. This glory is welcomed by the people, and I also feel honored. Let me also tell you about the situation at home. Your wife, Jin Guiying, gave birth bravely and labors well. This year's harvest is more than seven stone of grain, enough to eat. It's all the result of your wife Jin Guiying's labor. Now, responding to the government's call, she has learned to spin thread. In addition to doing housework, she also spins four ounces of thread every day. The most glorious thing is that this year the government elected labor heroes. Your wife Guiying was not only elected as the first-class labor hero in the village and district, winning many prizes, but also as a special-class labor hero in the whole county. The newspapers of eastern Hebei have all published it. Take a look, it's in the January 7th issue of the Eastern Hebei Daily! All of eastern Hebei knows about her. She is gloriously praised by the Communist Party and the people. I think you are also happy! You should also compete with your wife, bravely kill enemies and perform great meritorious service, and be published in the newspaper. At that time, glory will be added to glory! It would be so good to defeat the reactionaries and then go home to live a glorious life! We are all in good health, don't worry! Don't worry about anything, fight the enemy well, and I urge you to capture a few more war criminals! No more exhortations, write often to report your victories!
    Father Liu Deshun
    The clerk put away the letter.
    The comrades from Xinglong said, "It's not far off, our Xinglong has produced such an amazing female hero, I also feel honored!" Everyone laughed happily!
    "Whose wife is this? So capable!" Someone asked this question, and everyone suddenly remembered that they needed to know who the female labor hero's husband was. So, all the comrades in the team's heads started to move, looking east and west, to find Liu Deshun's son - Jin Guiying's husband.
    When the clerk read the passage "Your wife, Jin Guiying, gave birth bravely," Comrade Liu Wen knew that this was a letter from his father, but it mentioned his wife's affairs, and it was read in front of everyone, which was a bit embarrassing; however, he also heard that his wife was elected as a special-class labor hero in the whole county, and he was very happy in his heart; the more he thought about it, the more awkward he felt, the more he felt that everyone's eyes were on him, his heart beat faster, and his ears turned red all the way to his entire face. This secret was finally discovered by everyone: Comrade Liu Wen is the female hero's challenge object!
    Squad Deputy Liu Wen, a family of four, originally only had one mu of land. He used to work for the landlord, and for four years, it was like a slave. Tears and sweat irrigated the landlord's fertile land.
    The hard days finally came to an end. Xinglong County was liberated, and he was allocated seven mu of land. He stood up and turned over. In order to liberate the working people in other areas who were still being oppressed, he resolutely joined the People's Liberation Army. Now he has been promoted to deputy squad leader.
    However, one day, he suddenly thought that his old father was already over sixty years old, and his child was four years old, neither of whom could be considered a full person. Although his wife was twenty-six years old, at her prime, after all, she was a woman, and no matter how hard she worked, she would not be as good as a man, so who would take care of the land at home? A shadow swept over his heart. But this letter was like a reassurance pill, and the shadow in his heart immediately disappeared without a trace, brighter than a round of red sun. He didn't have to worry about his family not having labor force, he couldn't help but smile happily, so he also wrote two letters on a piece of paper, first to his father:
    "Dear Father: Having received your letter yesterday, I know everything inside. I will definitely do as you told me and strive to perform meritorious service. Please rest assured! And I hope you will obey the leadership of the village and work hard to support the front!"
    Below he wrote:
    "Dear Wife Guiying: I was very happy to hear that you were elected as a district and county labor hero and published in the Eastern Hebei Daily. I hope you will continue to work hard and be elected as a labor hero of the entire eastern Hebei! I have also made two small contributions in the front, but I am not proud and continue to prepare to make great contributions and wear a medal. I will take a photo of myself wearing the medal and send it back to you. I am determined to fight to the end for the liberation of all of China, I hope you can rest assured, I want to compete with you to see who makes more contributions and who is the real hero!"

　　“我要和你比赛立功！”
    羊雷　徐茹
    我军某部十日晚饭后，要开始游戏了，部队都集合在操场上。文书同志拿了一封信来说：“大家听我念一封信哪！我先不念这信是给谁的。但这封信是从兴隆来的！”兴隆籍的同志们心跳了，盼望这封信是给自己的。文书念道：××儿：
    来信收到了，你在部队上为了人民的解放，打下了全东北和冀东，这个光荣受着老百姓的欢迎，我也觉得光荣；再告诉你咱家的情况，你妻金桂荣生产真勇敢，劳动的很好，今年收有七石多粮，足够吃用，都是你妻金桂荣的劳动所得；现在已响应政府的号召，学会纺线，每天除做活外，还纺四两线。最光荣的是今年政府选举劳动英雄，你妻桂荣不但在村在区选为第一等劳动英雄，得奖品很多，在全县也是特等劳动英雄，冀东的报纸都登上了，你看看吧，在冀东日报一月七日的报纸上呢！全冀东都知道了她，光荣的受到共产党和人民的赞扬，我想你也欢喜吧！你也要和你妻比赛一下，英勇杀敌立下大功，登在报纸上，那时，光荣上又加光荣了！把反动派打干净了再回家过光荣日子多好呵！我们身体都很好，放心吧！一切不用惦念，好好打敌人吧，嘱你多捉拿几个战犯！不再多嘱，常来信报告胜利吧！　
    父刘德顺
    文书收起了信。
    兴隆的同志说：“不大离儿，我们兴隆还出了这么一个了不起的女英雄，我也觉着光荣！”大家都高兴的笑了！
    “这是谁的老婆？这么能干呢？”谁问了这么一句，大家也都猛然想起需要知道女劳动英雄的丈夫是谁的问题来。于是，全队同志的头都动起来了，东瞅瞅西望望，要找到刘德顺的儿子——金桂荣的丈夫。
    当文书念到“你妻金桂荣生产真勇敢”一段时，刘稳同志知道这是自己的父亲给他来的信了，不过上面有说到自己老婆的事，又在大伙面前念，实在有点不好意思；然而，又听到老婆被选为全县的特等劳动英雄，心里高兴得很；越想越忸怩，越觉得大家的眼睛都在看着他，他的心跳了，由耳朵根子一直红到全脸。这个秘密终被大家发现了：刘稳同志就是女英雄的挑战对象！
    一排副刘稳同志，一家四口人，原先只有一亩地，从前给地主扛活，四年的时间，简直就象奴隶一样，眼泪、汗水把地主的土地灌溉肥沃了。
    苦难的日子终于熬出来了，兴隆县得到了解放，他分得了七亩地，翻了身，为了解放其他地区还受着压迫的劳动人民，他毅然地参加了人民解放军。现在已升任到副排长了。
    然而，有一天，他忽然想到老爹爹已经六十多岁了，小孩子四岁，都不能顶一个整人使，老婆虽然二十六岁，正当年青力壮的时候，可是，究竟是娘们，怎么下力干活，也不如个男子汉哟，这样一来，家里的地谁去照顾呢？他心中拂上一层阴影。但是这封信正象一个定心丸，心里的阴影立时消散得无影无踪，比一轮红日还晴朗。他不用担心自己家里没有劳动力的事情了，自己不禁高兴地笑了起来，于是也在一张纸上，写成了两封信，先是给他父亲的：
    “父亲大人：昨接来信，内情尽知，儿一定能照父亲嘱咐的去做，争取光荣立大功，你老放心吧！并希望你老在村服从村中领导，多生产努力支援前线！”
    下面又写道：
    “桂荣妻：听到你当选为区、县劳动英雄，并登在冀东日报上时，我很高兴，希你继续努力，当选为全冀东的劳动英雄才好！我在前方也立了两小功，但我并不骄傲，继续准备立大功戴上奖章，我戴上奖章要照像给你捎回去的。我决心为解放全中国奋斗到底，望你放心，我要和你比赛，看谁立的功多，看谁是真英雄！”
