　　Establishment of Production Committee
　　Jicha Special District Strengthens Production Leadership
　　[Chahar News] To strengthen the leadership of production work, the Jicha Special District formally established a production committee on March 19th, and decided on several key issues in current production: First, land reform in the new district has basically ended. Currently, all efforts should be shifted to production, and production work should be the overriding central task. However, because our publicity on policies has not been thorough enough, some people in the new district still have concerns about re-investigation. Therefore, it is necessary to patiently and repeatedly explain to the masses that in areas where land reform has been completed, land ownership is determined and they can rest assured to engage in production and become prosperous. Second, cadres also have the erroneous idea of neglecting leadership in production. For example, some believe that the masses have been farming for thousands of years, so who wouldn't know how to farm? They regard large-scale production as an easy task. Others think, "Leading production requires agricultural knowledge, and you cannot lead production without agricultural knowledge." All of these will weaken the leadership of production work and must be resolutely and thoroughly overcome. Third, there is the issue of production for families of revolutionary martyrs, soldiers, and cadres. Especially in the old liberated areas, the number of families of revolutionary martyrs, soldiers, and cadres is very large. They lack labor and face many production difficulties. If we do not provide practical assistance, it will affect the entire production plan and the support for the People's Liberation War. Fourth, emphasize the leadership of production work and oppose the current state of indiscipline and anarchy. Improve the production leadership organizations at all levels (from the special district to the village) – the production committee, as well as the meeting and reporting system. Especially important is to conduct regular inspections, discover and solve problems in a timely manner, implement plans, exchange experiences, and promote work. In order to effectively promote the production movement and exchange experiences, the special district (and some individual counties) have decided to publish a small newspaper to guide the production movement. Finally, it was specifically determined that the current central tasks are: immediately check the preparation of fertilizer accumulation, manure delivery, seeds, fuel, and tree planting, and organize mutual aid work teams.

　　成立生产委员会
  　冀察专区加强生产领导
    【察哈尔讯】为加强生产工作的领导，冀察专区于三月十九日正式成立了生产委员会，决定了当前生产中几个主要问题：一、新区土改已基本结束，目前应把全部精力转入生产，把生产工作作为压倒一切的中心工作。但由于我们对政策宣传还不够深入，部分新区群众还存在着复查的顾虑，故应耐心反复向群众说明：凡完成土改地区，地权就算确定，可放心生产，发财致富。二、干部思想上也存在着忽视领导生产的错误思想。如有的认为群众种地几千年了，那个不会种？把大生产看成轻而易举的事。也有的认为“领导生产必须有农业知识，你们没有农业知识，领导不了生产。”所有这些都会削弱对生产工作的领导。必须坚决彻底克服。三、是烈、军、干属的生产问题。尤其老区烈军干属数量很大。他们缺乏劳力，生产困难很多，如不切实帮助，就会影响整个生产计划与支援人民解放战争。四、强调对生产工作的领导，反对目前存在的某些无纪律、无政府状态。健全各级（专区到村）生产领导机构——生产委员会，以及会议、汇报制度，尤其重要的是要经常进行检查，及时发现问题、解决问题，做到贯彻计划，交流经验推动工作。为了有效的推动生产运动，交流经验，专区（还有个别县）决定出版指导生产运动小报。最后，并具体确定当前中心工作是：立即检查积肥、送粪、籽种、燃料的准备情形，及植树情形，和组织拨工互助等工作。
