[Comprehensive report from this newspaper] The enthusiastic labor support movement unfolding in Beiping vividly demonstrates the boundless love of the people of Beiping for the People's Liberation Army. From March 26th onwards, the ten district governments' offices were packed with people delivering慰劳品 (comfort items) every day from 8:00 AM to 4:00 PM. Cigarettes, soap, letters of appreciation… the comrades receiving the comfort items were overwhelmed. By March 31st, the ninth district had received慰劳款 (comfort money) totaling 12,970,200 yuan (People's Currency), 20 banners, 344 letters of appreciation, over 9,000 bars of soap, and many other items. In the eleventh district, the wife of a tricyclist spent her savings to buy a towel, a tube of toothpaste, and a bar of soap, and spent a day embroidering a very delicate comfort bag to give to the People's Liberation Army. Her husband also contributed 20 yuan to express his feelings. An elderly, impoverished woman in Menlou, having no money to buy慰劳品(comfort items), felt she couldn't stand idly by, so she washed her own used towel clean and gave it to the People's Liberation Army. The people of the third district also wrote letters of appreciation. By March 31st, over 1,000 letters of appreciation had been received. In addition, the fourth, eighth, and eighteenth districts, among others, actively launched labor support movements. To celebrate the troops heading south, the second, fourth, eighth, eleventh, twelfth, and nineteenth districts of Beiping held joint celebration meetings with the stationed People's Liberation Army.

　　平市各区一片劳军声
    【本报综合消息】北平市热烈开展着的劳军运动，生动地说明了北平人民对人民解放军的无限热爱。十区区政府从三月二十六日起，保办公处每天上午八时至下午四时总是挤满了送慰劳品的人们，香烟、肥皂、慰问信……忙得收慰劳品的同志不可开交。九区截至三十一日止，已收到慰劳款一千二百九十七万零二百元（人民券）、锦旗二十面、慰问信三百四十四封、肥皂九千余块，及其他物品很多。十一区一位三轮车夫的妻子把平素积下来的钱买了毛巾一条，牙粉一包，香皂一块，并花费一天工夫刺绣了一个很精致的慰问袋送给解放军，她丈夫也慰劳了二十元，以表示自己的心意。门楼一个贫苦老太太，自己没钱买慰劳品，但又过意不去，便把她自己用过的一条毛巾洗干净送给人民解放军。三区的人民，也都纷纷写信慰问。截至三十一日，已收到慰问信一千多件。此外，四区、八区、十八等区也都积极展开了劳军运动。为欢送部队南下，平市二、四、八、十一、十二、十九等区曾分别与驻地之人民解放军先后举行了联欢大会。
