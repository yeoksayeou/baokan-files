(Jinan Electricity News) Public and private factories in southern Hebei are developing cultural education and recreational activities for their workers. The Handan City Electric Company, various iron factories, the Yihua Iron Factory in Linqing City, and the Huachang Textile Factory and Hongji Tannery in Nangong City have mostly restored or established worker amateur schools. Generally, schools divide students into different classes based on their varying levels, and in conjunction with the factory, they organize a school committee responsible for managing, supervising, inspecting, and summarizing learning. Teachers are hired or elected from among the more educated workers. Zhao Yuqing, Deputy Secretary of the Handan Municipal Party Committee, Mayor Ma, and Xue Jinglun, Director of the Organization Department of the Municipal Party Committee, all teach courses at the workers' night school. Currently, in addition to work and games, reading books and newspapers, learning to read, and writing have become the main content of workers' lives in various factories. The Handan City Electric Company established a small library to facilitate workers' reading. Most factories have also established "clubs" and "blackboard newspapers" as cultural and recreational venues. The blackboard newspaper of the Feixiang Clothing Factory is named "Workers' Paradise" by the workers and features workers' production, creations, model figures, letters of challenge, criticisms, and suggestions every day. These are all clapper rhymes and songs written by the workers themselves. For example, one clapper rhyme says: "Comrades, come and see, work has improved this week, Group Five has the most quantity, Group Five has the best quality, Group Four has a lot of quantity, but the quality is too poor." It promoted and encouraged the enthusiasm of all workers in labor and learning.

　　冀南各厂设业余学校
  　邯郸市委兼课
    【冀南电】冀南各地公营和私营工厂，开展职工文化教育工作及文化娱乐活动。邯郸市电灯公司、铁业各工厂，临清市益华铁工厂，南宫市华昌纺织厂、宏记制革厂等，已大部恢复或成立了职工业余学校。一般学校都是根据职工不同程度，划分了不同的学习班次，并与厂方结合组织学委会，负责管理、督促、检查和总结学习。教员是聘请或选举程度高的职工担任。邯郸市市委副书记赵玉清、马市长、市委组织部长薛经纶均在工人夜校担任一门课程。现各工厂除工作和游戏外，看书、看报、识字、写字，成了职工生活的主要内容。邯郸市电灯公司为了职工们看书方便，成立了一个小型图书馆。大多数工厂同时建立了“俱乐部”、“黑板报”等文娱园地。肥乡被服工厂的黑板报，工人给它命名为“职工乐园”，每天都登载着工人的生产、创造、模范人物、挑战书、批评和建议。都是职工自编的快板、歌谣。如其中一个快板说：“诸位同志都来瞧，这旬工作均提高，数量最多第五组，质量五组为最好，四组数量虽然多，可惜质量太差了。”它推动和鼓励了全体职工的劳动和学习热情。
