Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 28th: Moscow Dispatch: The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR promulgated an order on the 21st, stipulating that the glorious title of Hero of Socialist Labor, the Order of Lenin, the Order of the Red Banner, the Medal for Labor Valor, and the Medal for Distinguished Labor will be awarded to first-class agricultural workers who have made outstanding achievements in animal husbandry from 1949 to 1951, in order to reward them for increasing the number of livestock and improving the output of animal husbandry products. The order stipulates that collective farm chairmen, heads, directors, and managers of animal husbandry departments of collective farms, state farms, and experimental stations, animal experts, and veterinarians, etc., who exceed the annual plan by 50 percent in terms of increasing the number of livestock, will be awarded the glorious title of Hero of Socialist Labor; those who exceed the plan by 30 percent will be awarded the Order of Lenin; those who exceed the plan by 20 percent will be awarded the Order of the Red Banner of Labor; and those who exceed the plan by 10 percent will be awarded the Medal for Labor Valor and the Medal for Distinguished Labor. Milkmaids, herdsmen, pig breeders, sheep herders, breeders, and leaders of various groups in the animal husbandry departments of collective farms or state farms, who have reached a certain output of animal husbandry products, have made certain achievements in raising young animals, and have increased the weight of livestock; such as completing the annual plan for increasing the breed of each type of livestock and increasing the sown area and yield of feed grass, are all qualified to receive the glorious title of Hero of Socialist Labor or medals. For example, a milkmaid in a collective farm who can squeeze an average of 5,000 kilograms of milk from a dairy cow each year, including 190 kilograms of cream, can receive the glorious title of Hero of Socialist Labor.
　　Another order announced that animal experts, veterinarians and their assistants, agricultural economists, engineers, and outstanding personnel engaged in livestock breeding, who have served for a long time without any defects, will also be awarded medals and badges. Among them, experts with outstanding achievements will also receive honorary titles such as Honorary Animal Expert and Honorary Veterinarian. A True Pravda editorial stated: This order will arouse great enthusiasm in the countryside. In order to respond to the Party and the government's concern for livestock breeding, collective farmers, state farms, and workers at machine and tractor stations will redouble their efforts to fight for the improvement of socialist animal husbandry.
