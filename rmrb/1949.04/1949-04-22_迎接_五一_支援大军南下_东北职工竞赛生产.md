Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 20th. Northeast workers in various regions have launched a production competition to greet the "May 1st" International Labor Day, which has become even more vigorous under the enthusiastic encouragement of supporting the army going south. Workers at the Fourth Factory of the Northeast Chemical Pharmaceutical Plant, under the slogan "We will make whatever medicine the People's Liberation Army needs," largely completed the task of urgently producing 500,000 bottles of emergency water in five days. Every production link in the factory is working intensely. In the past, it took the filling workers 20 minutes to fill 240 bottles of emergency water, but now it only takes 15 minutes. In the past, 23 workers washed 14,000 bottles a day, but now only 12 people can wash 11,000 bottles a day. The Northeast Fourth Textile Factory originally used 285 people to watch 99 machines, but now the same number of machines only requires 255 people. At the same time, the factory has paid attention to reducing defective products, and the waste line of each 100 jin of finished products in the axis department has been reduced from 0.65% to 0.5%. The original vehicle turnover rate of the Andong Railway Bureau was set at 1.28 days, but in the competition, it only took an average of 1.08 days. The Shenyang Railway Factory guarantees that it will exceed the planned task by 75% in April.旋盘工(Lathe workers) Shen Jimeng and Li Qingsheng originally operated one lathe each. After research, they changed to one person operating two lathes. The two took turns day and night, so two people could complete the tasks of four people. Various departments of the Northeast Automobile General Factory Rubber Factory have fully exerted their production efficiency to ensure more cars are produced. Before the competition, more than 40 people in the battery class produced 74 finished products a day, but now 7 people can produce 80 a day. The bleaching powder department of the Northeast Chemical Plant is stepping up the repair of six reaction chambers before "May 1st," so that the output of bleaching powder can be increased from more than 120 tons per month to more than 300 tons. Workers in various factories of the Harbin Municipal Enterprises are actively striving to be models. Xue Jingxian of the water plant dug a large pit three meters deep and two meters in diameter in one day, breaking the pit digging record. Yin Chuanli of the technical section used sulfuric acid to wash copper rust, increasing the number of water meters repaired from one per day to ten, which increased the efficiency by three times. After Jilin City held a mobilization meeting on "April 12th" to launch a production competition to support the army going south, workers, members, and youth league members were determined to complete the competition plan. Military industry workers guarantee to complete the production tasks of marching pots and shovels by the end of April. In the second day of the competition, Yuhua Paper Mill copied 1,660 jin of paper in 21 hours, exceeding the average daily output of the previous month by more than 500 jin. The Dunhua Fire Saw Factory in Jilin Province has completed the three-month plan seven days ahead of schedule, producing a total of 65,496 sleepers, and the finished product standard exceeded the original quota by 2%. The leather factory of the Rehe Military Region completed the task of 12,000 cartridge and gun straps ahead of schedule. The clothing factory workers completed the plan to manufacture 10,000 pairs of finger straps one month ahead of schedule ten days in advance. Workers in other state-owned enterprises in various places have guaranteed to use more and better production results as gifts for the "May 1st" festival.
