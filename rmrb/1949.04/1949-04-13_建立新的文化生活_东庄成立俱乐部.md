　　Establishing a New Cultural Life
  　Dongzhuang Establishes a Club
    [Taihang Telegraph] Responding to the Administrative Office's call for pilot clubs to strengthen rural cultural activities, the Dongzhuang Village Club in the Third District of Pingshun was officially established on March 15th. The masses in this village have always had a high enthusiasm for learning. Winter schools, people's schools, and youth literacy classes have achieved considerable success. Recently, upon receiving instructions from the Administrative Office, the village branch held a meeting on March 10th to study the matter. Subsequently, the village government convened a mass meeting on the 11th, explaining the nature of the club and its organizational form, allowing the masses to spontaneously deliberate and discuss. Tian Shun said, "This must be a good thing. If we want to hear the news, someone will tell us. If we want to learn to read, someone will teach us. If we want to engage in entertainment, someone will lead us." As a result of the discussion, it was decided to change the literacy class into a "Youth Remedial School." When the general meeting initiated voluntary registration for the remedial school, all the young men and women in the village rushed to the registration table. In less than ten minutes, 43 people registered (including 23 women), and there were many more young people who were not at home, and the number will increase in the future. Then, club members were democratically elected, with the village head serving as the director of the committee, under which there were three departments: Political Education, Cultural Education, and Cultural Entertainment. With the efforts of the committee members and the masses of the whole village, the club carried out renovation work on the site of the old winter school: the walls were whitewashed, and the tables, benches, doors, windows, public blackboards, and slogan signs were all prepared. The courtyard was cleaned very thoroughly. On the night of the 15th, a club founding meeting was held, attended by more than 400 men and women, and the central principal of the Third District and the education directors of several large nearby villages also came to visit. At the meeting, it was decided that the club would hold political classes on the 3rd, 6th, and 9th, literacy classes on the 2nd, 4th, 6th, 8th, and 10th, read newspapers on the 2nd, 5th, and 8th, broadcast on the 5th and 10th, and organize correspondents to enrich the public blackboard. At present, the masses, especially young men and women, are extremely enthusiastic about learning. Therefore, spring ploughing production and other work have also been effectively promoted.

　　建立新的文化生活
  　东庄成立俱乐部
    【太行电】响应行署试办俱乐部的号召，加强农村文化活动，平顺三区东庄村俱乐部于三月十五日正式成立。该村群众学习情绪一向很高，冬学，民校和青年识字班素有相当成绩。近接行署指示，该村支部于三月十日召开会议研究，接着村政府十一日召开了群众大会，说明俱乐部的性质及其组织形式，让群众自动酝酿讨论。天顺说：“这该不是好哩，想听报有人讲，想识字有人教，想搞娱乐又有人领导。”讨论结果，决定改识字班为“青年补习学校”。当大会发起补习学校自愿报名时，全村青年男女都涌向报名桌前，不到十分钟就报了四十三人（其中女二十三名），还有好多青年没有在家，以后还要增多。接着民主选出了俱乐部委员，以村长为主任委员，下设政治教育、文化教育、文化娱乐三部。在各委员与全村群众的努力下，俱乐部就冬学旧址进行修建工作：墙粉白了，桌凳、门窗、大众黑板、标语牌……，也都准备得齐齐全全，院内打扫得非常干净。十五日黑夜召开了俱乐部成立大会，到会男女四百余人，三区中心校长及附近几个大村的教育主任也来参观。会上确定俱乐部三、六、九日上政治课，二、四、六、八、十日上识字课，二、五、八读报，逢五逢十广播，并组织通讯员，充实大众黑板。现群众尤其是男女青年，学习情绪极高。因此，春耕生产等工作，也得到有力推动。
