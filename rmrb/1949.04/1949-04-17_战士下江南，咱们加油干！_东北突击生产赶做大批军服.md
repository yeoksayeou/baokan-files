　　"Soldiers March South, Let's Work Harder!"
  　Northeast Launches Crash Production of Large Quantities of Military Uniforms
    [Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 16th] Workers in factories affiliated with the Logistics Department of the Northeast Military Region are launching crash production to ensure that the People's Liberation Army marching south is supplied with the best quality military supplies. Several large factories have already shipped tens of thousands of military uniforms to areas within the passes. This batch of military uniforms is sufficient to provide each soldier of the Northeast People's Liberation Army's southbound troops with two sets of single-layer clothing, one blanket, four pairs of shoes, one set of undershirts, and two towels, as well as a large quantity of gauze for making mosquito nets and masks, and a large number of bullet pouches, grenade pouches, bandages, and satchels. Because the military uniforms are of excellent quality, and the uniforms for each branch of service are sewn separately according to the operating characteristics of the branch, the soldiers are very satisfied after receiving them. In completing this large-scale military uniform task, the workers in the factories affiliated with the Logistics Department were in high spirits. After receiving the task of producing the seventh batch of 30,800 sets of soldiers' uniforms and 30,000 sets of cadres' uniforms, the workers of the Second Clothing Factory automatically worked overtime and encouraged each other, saying, "The soldiers are marching south, let's work harder!" The workers of the Third and Fourth Clothing Factories happily said after receiving the task of making tank uniforms, "Now we are making tank uniforms, just wait and see, soon we will also be making naval and air force uniforms!" They completed the task at an average speed of 25 sets in 32 hours per person. In completing the military shoe task, the Rubber Factory greatly improved its work efficiency. The factory's average daily shoe production in February was 8,050 pairs, which increased to 10,800 pairs in March, and recently reached a record of 13,000 pairs per day.

　　“战士下江南，咱们加油干！”
  　东北突击生产赶做大批军服
    【新华社沈阳十六日电】东北军区军需部所属各工厂职工突击生产，保证以质量最好的军需品供给南下的人民解放军。若干大工厂早以数以万计的军服运往关内。这批军服，除足以供给东北人民解放军南进部队的每个战士有两套单衣、一床毯子、四双鞋子、一套衬衣、两条毛巾之外，还有做蚊帐、口罩用的大批纱布及大量子弹袋、手榴弹袋、绑带、挂包等。由于军服质量精良，而且各兵种的制服都按照兵种操作特点分别缝制，战士们领到后都很满意。在完成此项大批军服任务中，军需部所属各厂工人情绪极高。被服第二厂工人在接到第七批三万零八百套战士服与三万套干部服的任务后，即自动加班加点，并互相鼓励说：“战士下江南，咱们加油干。”被服三、四两厂的工人接到做坦克服的任务后，高兴地说：“现在做坦克服，瞧着罢，不久还要做海空军服呢！”他们每人平均以三十二小时做二十五套的速度完成了任务。橡胶厂在完成军鞋任务中，工作效率大大提高。该厂二月份平均一天产鞋八千零五十双，三月份便提高到一万零八百双，最近且已达到一天产一万三千双的纪录。
