Laizhuo Area
　　Smashes Secret Society

　　[Reported by this newspaper] The "Wutai Mountain Universal Salvation Buddhist Church," which incited the masses and conspired to riot, was smashed on March 28th by the Pingxi Sub-district Public Security Office in conjunction with the Laizhuo Public Security Bureau. The principal criminals Zhang Yaoxi, Guo Yunpeng, Guo Tinglan, Li Xiangquan, and Li Shutian were arrested on the spot and have been sent to the Laizhuo Public Security Bureau for interrogation. When the Laizhuo County Government received the instruction from the North China People's Government to dissolve feudal superstitious reactionary secret societies, it formally announced the decree and called on the leaders of the societies to register and start anew. The society, on the one hand, had more than ten instructors, including Yang Qinglian, register with the People's Government. On the other hand, it secretly organized personnel to go to the countryside to continue collecting "society grain." In the city, it newly established two professional organs (Xi Yi Xing and Dong Yi Xing, the original professional organ was Tian Shun Xing, and it planned to establish Nan Yi Xing and Bei Yi Xing) to cover up illegal activities. Internally, it privately hid military supplies and externally claimed that it would "manifest the Dao" (meaning riot) no later than the Dragon Boat Festival. The Gao Village society leader planned to kill the village cadres on the day of "manifesting the Dao." The Zugezhuang instructor even beat and scolded county and district cadres, hindering the work of supporting the front lines. After the special and county public security organs learned of this situation, they dispatched personnel with warrants on March 28th to arrest the above-mentioned five people in the city (at Tian Shun Xing, Dong Yi Xing, and Xi Yi Xing) and outside the city in Xishicun. They found six bayonets, two hand grenades, two artillery shell casings, several blank slips with our official seals, and several name rosters in the hidden passage of the Xi Yi Xing house. That evening, Deputy County Chief Dong convened a joint general meeting, and on the 29th, a mass meeting was held to announce the truth. In order to save the general members of the society who had gone astray, the People's Government specially announced that as long as the general members repent, start anew, and stop their activities, the People's Government will not pursue the matter.

　　涞涿地区
  　破获会门
    【本报讯】煽惑群众、阴谋暴动之“五台山普济佛教会”，已于三月二十八日为我平西分区公安办事处会同涞涿公安局破获。主犯张耀西、郭云鹏、郭廷岚、李相全、李树田等五人当场被逮捕，现已送涞涿公安局审讯。涞涿县府于接到华北人民政府之解散封建迷信反动会门指示时，曾正式宣布该项法令，并号召会头登记自新。该会一面由教头杨青莲等十余人到人民政府进行登记，一面竟暗地组织人员下乡，继续征收“会粮”，在城内则新设了两个职业机关（西义兴和东义兴，原有职业机关为天顺兴，并计划设立南义兴与北义兴），用以掩护进行非法活动。内部并私藏军火，对外扬言最迟不过五月节要“明道”（即暴动之意）。高村会头计划于“明道”之日先杀死村干部。祖各庄教头竟打骂县区干部，阻碍支援前线齐工工作。专、县公安机关侦知此种情形后，即于三月二十八日派员持票分于城内（天顺兴、东、西义兴三处）及城外西町村逮捕上述五人，并于西义兴房夹道内搜出刺刀六把、手榴弹二枚、炮弹衣二个、盖有我公章之白条数张、花名册数册。当晚由董副县长召开了联合全体大会，二十九日召开群众大会宣布真象。人民政府为挽救误入歧途之一般会徒，特宣布今后一般会众只要悔过自新、停止活动，人民政府当不再追究。
