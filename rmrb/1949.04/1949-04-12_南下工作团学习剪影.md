　　Sketches of Study in the Southward Work Group
　　First Brigade, Third Company Wang Cheng
　　It has been thirteen days since March 11th, when six military trucks carried more than two hundred of us students from Tsinghua University to this place. In these ten days or so, our lives have completely changed. In the past, education was like cramming, but now it has become spontaneous and automatic. In the past, professors lectured above, and we copied everything into our notebooks, regardless of whether it was right or wrong. When the exam day came, we memorized it by rote so that we could recite it on the exam paper the next day, and then everything would be fine. If you were a little more diligent, you could also go to the magnificent library in the evening to flip through the thick and intimidating original reference books; otherwise, you could still pass. But now? The classical Anglo-American bourgeois stuff is gone, replaced by the knowledge urgently needed by the current Chinese revolution—in class, we have reports from our revolutionary predecessors, such as Minister Xiao Xiangrong's report on the current situation on March 18th. After listening to the lecture, we go to find reference materials. Although these materials are mostly thin and light pamphlets, they are actually more useful to us than those thick and heavy ones. We launched discussions in the evening based on the lectures and materials. The truth was discovered in our heated debates. Therefore, our progress is very rapid; of course, the newly established small library has also given us a lot of help.
　　We have set a one-and-a-half-month study plan, preparing to educate ourselves into good revolutionary fighters in this short period of one and a half months. At that time, we will stand firm on the proletarian stand, train ourselves to be able to endure hardship and hard work, and have full revolutionary knowledge and confidence in victory, so that we can cooperate with the Liberation Army to liberate the 200 million people in Jiangnan.
　　In addition to the study of knowledge and culture, our brigade has also established various entertainment activities such as singing, dancing, drama, and sports, making life more lively and allowing each student to develop their talents in various aspects as much as possible. Every weekend, we have a very lively party. At the party, students who love music and drama, like students who love literature and art in the wall newspaper, also have excellent performances. This is to celebrate the victory of our week's study.
　　On the second day after arriving here, each person was issued a set of high-quality grass-green uniforms. It is said that this is cadre clothing. After putting it on, we looked at each other and felt very fresh and glorious at the same time. Now, since putting on the uniforms, we are no longer students. We are already the people's servants, already the People's Liberation Army; we have a heavy burden on our shoulders, but we all bravely and happily accept it, watching the demons of Jiangnan be crushed in our hands, and Mao Zedong's victorious flag will surely be planted all over China with us.

　　南下工作团学习剪影
    第一大队、第三中队  王成
    自从三月十一日六辆军用大卡车载了我们二百多位同学，驰离清华园到了这里以来已有十三天，在这十多天中我们的生活完全变了样，过去是填鸭式的教育，现在变成了自发自动；过去教授先生在上面讲，我们就不管对不对的都照样抄到笔记簿上去，如果到了考试的日子便把它死啃下去，以便在第二天背到考卷上去，于是乎便诸事大吉。如果你用功一点，也可以在晚上到富丽堂皇的图书馆去翻翻又厚又重唬吓人的原文参考书，否则也可以及格了。现在呢？古典的英美资产阶级的东西没有了，改为目前中国革命所迫切需要的学识，——在上课时有我们革命的前辈们的报告，如三月十八日有萧向荣部长关于目前形势的报告。听了演讲以后就去找参考资料，虽然这些资料大都是又薄又轻的小册子，实在对我们比那些又厚又重的要更有用些。我们根据了演讲与资料在晚上展开讨论。真理便在我们脸红脖子粗的辩论中被发现了。因此我们的进步是很快的；当然新成立的小型图书馆也给了我们很多的帮助。
    我们定了一个半月的学习计划，预备在这一个半月的短暂时间中，把我们教育成一个革命的好战士；那时候我们站稳了无产阶级的立场，锻炼得自己能够刻苦耐劳，有了充分的革命的知识与胜利的信心，便可配合解放铁军去解放江南二万万人民了。
    除了知识文化的学习，在我们大队里还成立了歌咏、舞蹈、戏剧、体育各种娱乐活动，使生活变得更生动活泼，并且可以尽量发展每一个同学在各方面的才能。每一次周末，我们有一个顶热闹的晚会，在晚会上爱好音乐戏剧的同学们如爱好文艺的同学们在壁报上的表现一样也有了很好的表演，这是庆祝我们一周学习的胜利。
    自到这里的第二天就每人发了一套质地很好的草绿色制服，据说这是干部服，穿上了，我们彼此你看看我，我看看你，觉得很新鲜，同时也觉得很光荣。现在，自穿上了制服以后，我们不再是学生了，我们已经是人民的勤务员，已经是人民解放军；我们肩上有很重的负荷，可是我们都勇敢地愉快地接受了它，看江南的群魔会在我们手下粉碎，毛泽东胜利的旗帜一定会随我们插遍全中国。
