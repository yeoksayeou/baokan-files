　　Xing Tang Resolves to Conquer 90,000 Mu of Sandy Wasteland
  　Seven Districts Build a 25 Li Forest Belt
    [Our Newspaper] The huge afforestation plan of Xing Tang to conquer 97,000 mu of sandy wasteland has completed one-half of the annual afforestation plan in one season (one year is divided into three seasons). According to incomplete statistics from seven districts, more than 250,000 trees have been planted. In the fourth district, 20 villages including Baimiao have planted 38,000 trees, and with Jialuoying as the focus, 450 trees were planted north of the village, a windbreak forest of one and a half li long was built, and an old windbreak forest of one and a half li was repaired, with 965 trees replanted. In the seventh district, 13 villages including Beilonggang along the Shahe River have planted 91,246 trees, and 14 villages including Jia Zhuang have planted 23,550 trees, forming a continuous forest belt of up to 25 li. In addition, 64 mu of nurseries were opened for afforestation on forbidden mountains. In order to solve the difficulty of tree seedlings, Jialuoying Village carried out cooperative afforestation. Villages such as Xiguan in the sixth district signed 20 mu of afforestation contracts, with one side providing the land and the other providing labor and seedlings, and the trees were divided equally when they grew up. In addition to in-depth mobilization in afforestation, emphasis was placed on forest protection education and the formulation of forest protection covenants: those who destroy will be fined, and those who contribute will be rewarded. This dispelled the peasants' concerns about "planting trees in vain" in previous years.

　　行唐决征服九万亩沙荒
  　七区建廿五里林带
    【本报讯】行唐征服九万七千亩沙荒的巨大造林计划，在一季中（一年分三季）完成了全年造林计划的二分之一。据七个区的不完全统计，已植树二十五万余株。四区白庙等二十村已植三万八千株，并以贾洛营为重点，在村北植四百五十株，修一条长一里半的防风林，又修补旧防风林一里半，补树九百六十五株。七区沙河沿岸之北龙岗等十三村已植九万一千二百四十六株，贾庄等十四村已植二万三千五百五十株，形成连续长达二十五里的林带。另外，禁山造林开植苗圃六十四亩。为解决树苗困难，贾洛营村进行合作造林。六区之西关等村订立了二十亩植树合同，一边出地，一边出劳动力和树秧，树长大对半分。在造林中除深入动员外，并着重护林教育和制定护林公约：破坏者罚，有功者奖。这样解除了农民往年“植树白费劲”的思想顾虑。
