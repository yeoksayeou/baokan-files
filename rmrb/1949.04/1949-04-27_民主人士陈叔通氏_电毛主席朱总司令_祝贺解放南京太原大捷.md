　　Democratic Personage Mr. Chen Shutong
  　Cables Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu
  　Congratulating Them on the Great Victories of Liberating Nanjing and Taiyuan
    [This newspaper special dispatch] Democratic personage Mr. Chen Shutong sent a cable to Chairman Mao and Commander-in-Chief Zhu, congratulating them on the great victories of liberating Nanjing and Taiyuan. The cable stated: "Chairman Mao of the Chinese People's Revolutionary Military Commission, Commander-in-Chief Zhu of the Chinese People's Liberation Army: Since the Kuomintang reactionaries ruled China, the nation's vitality has been severely damaged, and the nation is about to perish. The reactionary chief culprit Chiang Kai-shek and his clique are selling out the country and harming the people, as is known to all both at home and abroad. The Communist Party of China leads the people's democratic revolution, openly advocating the Three-Anti's policy, and all patriotic masses follow suit. The People's Liberation Army is the armed force to realize the people's will. Chairman and Commander-in-Chief share their strategies, and all commanders and fighters bravely eliminate the enemy. Last year, in the Huaihai Campaign, the enemy's main force collapsed overnight. This time, crossing the river to seize the puppet capital took only three days. Taiyuan, known for its dangerous terrain, could not withstand a single blow. It is believed that the army and people are of one mind, and nothing can be destroyed. The reactionary rule has come to an end. Although the wandering souls are still there, they are just remnants of the setting sun. Seeing that wherever the banner goes, people will greet you with food and drinks, and the new country's framework will be established soon. I hereby offer my congratulations and respectfully request your attention. Chen Shutong, April 26, Year 38 [of the Republic]."

    【本报特讯】民主人士陈叔通氏致电毛主席朱总司令祝贺解放南京太原大捷。电称：“中国人民革命军事委员会毛主席中国人民解放军朱总司令：中国被国民党反动派统治以来，国脉几以斫伤，民族亦将沦丧。反动罪魁蒋介石及其集团，卖国殃民，中外共悉。中国共产党领导人民民主革命，明揭三反主张，爱国群众，莫不率从。人民解放军即为实现人民意志之武力。主席总司令共纾韬略，各路指挥员战斗员无不奋勇灭敌。上年淮南之役，敌军主力，一夕而崩。此次渡江伪都三日亦破。太原号称险固，亦复不当一击。足信军民一心，无坚不摧。反动统治，已告灭亡，游魂虽在，只方残照。行见旄麾所至，壶箪前迎，新国规模，指日即立。特此具贺，敬惟公鉴。陈叔通三十八年四月二十六日”
