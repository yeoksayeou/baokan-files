　　The Ping City People's Government
  　Holds Air Defense Meeting
    [This newspaper reports] The Beiping Municipal Government held an air defense meeting at Donghuating at 2:00 PM yesterday (the 23rd) to discuss city-wide air defense matters. More than twenty units including the Municipal Committee and the Public Security Bureau attended. Secretary-General Xue of the Municipal Government explained that, based on the Kuomintang reactionaries' repeated playing of false peace tricks and our army's continuous crossing of the river, directly approaching Nanjing, enemy planes may come to Ping to cause disruption, so it is necessary to make necessary preparations. After discussions by the representatives, the following was decided: (1) Based on the size of each agency, establish an air defense committee or air defense group to direct all air defense matters. (2) Organize various publicity activities to educate the masses to prepare for air defense, so as to avoid being panicked and suffering losses in an emergency. (3) Organize fire brigades, patrol teams, rescue teams and other organizations according to the circumstances of each agency. Comrade Zhang Wenqi of the Municipal Health Bureau introduced the city's rescue plan. The city's air defense organization will be led by the Municipal Garrison Command. The city's blackout and air raid warning signals are being handled by the Air Defense Command in a unified manner.
