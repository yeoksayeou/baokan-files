　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 25th: British imperialists are still attempting to expand armed intervention in China's internal affairs and aggression against China under the pretext of the British warship incident. According to a dispatch from Electric News Agency, Washington, April 24th: British Foreign Secretary Bevin has formally requested the United States to provide naval and air force "assistance" on the Yangtze River. It is said that the U.S. government has not yet decided whether to intervene in the Yangtze River, but has dispatched the U.S. cruisers "Power" and "Manchester" to China, carrying U.S. Marines formed into landing groups. The notorious war-monger Churchill is also preparing to make anti-China clamors in the House of Commons on the 26th regarding the British warship incident. According to a dispatch from Electric News Agency, London, April 24th: The British government has confirmed that the interventionist adventure on the Yangtze River has gone bankrupt. It has ordered the remaining sailors on the Amethyst to prepare explosives to blow up the ship upon receiving a signal. The sailors of the Amethyst, who were used as sacrificial victims of imperialist adventures by the British Labour government, are being used for anti-communist performances in British colonies in the Far East and in Britain itself. The first act of the anti-communist performance has been staged with great skill by the British police and the Labour Party in southeastern England. Because the pitiful parents who lost their sons in the interventionist adventure on the Yangtze River, incited by the Labour Party and the police, have begun violent anti-communist performances in Dartford and Tonbridge in southern England. They are trying to alleviate the pain of losing their sons with "patriotic" outbursts. The Labour Party and the police are telling them to attack those British Communists who raise the following questions: On whose orders was the Yangtze River incident carried out? What was its purpose? All the bourgeois newspapers in Britain said before the facts of the Yangtze River battle were determined that these sailors were killed by "Communist artillery fire." The question of why British warships should be between the two warring lines on the Yangtze River has been submerged by the thousands of words of anti-communist propaganda. After its military interventionist purpose on the Yangtze River was not achieved, the Labour government is now at least attempting to create incidents to carry out fierce anti-communist propaganda for the upcoming general election. The Labour Party is facing increasing dissatisfaction with its policies and fears suffering defeat in the election. But the British warship's invasion of China has been exposed by all clear-headed British people. Even British merchants in Hong Kong are criticizing the British government's adventurous invasion of China. According to Agence France-Presse, Hong Kong, April 23rd: "These people questioned the British claim that British warships have the right to navigate the Yangtze River. They pointed out that the CCP has publicly declared all agreements concluded by the Kuomintang invalid, and they described Britain's decision to send warships to the Yangtze River at this time (when the Communist army was approaching the Yangtze River and had launched a general offensive aimed at occupying the whole of China) as a clumsy move."

　　英帝图借英舰侵华事件
  　扩大武装侵华活动
  　续遭英国人民责难
    【新华社北平二十五日电】英国帝国主义者仍图借英舰侵华事件扩大武装干涉中国内政、侵略中国的活动。据电通社华盛顿二十四日电：英外相贝文已正式要求美国在长江上给予海、空军的“帮助”，据说，美国政府尚未决定是否在长江进行干涉，但是已派遣美国巡洋舰“鲍尔”号与“曼彻斯特”号驶往中国，船上装载的是编成登陆组的美国海军陆战队。著名战争贩子邱吉尔亦准备于二十六日在下院就英舰事件发表反华叫喊。据电通社伦敦二十四日电称：英政府已证实在长江的干涉冒险破产，它命令紫石英号上残留的水兵准备爆炸物，一得到信号就把该舰炸毁。紫石英号被英国工党政府用作帝国主义分子冒险的牺牲品的水手，正被用来在远东英国殖民地以及英国本国作反共表演。反共表演的第一幕已由英国警察及工党以极大的技巧在英国东南部演出。因为干涉主义者在长江的冒险中所丧失了儿子的可怜的双亲们，受工党及警察的鼓动，在英国南部的达尔芳斯及托尼斯开始了反共的粗暴表演。他们试图以“爱国”的发泄来减轻丧失儿子的痛苦。工党及警察告诉他们攻击那些提出下述问题的英国共产党人：长江事件是谁的命令？它是为了什么目的？英国所有资产阶级的报纸都在长江战役的事实确定之前说，这些水手是被“共产党的炮火”打死。英国军舰为什么应到长江的两敌对战线之间，这一问题为反共宣传的千言万语所淹没。其长江冒险的军事干涉目的没有达到后，工党政府现在至少正企图制造事件，为未来的大选进行猛烈的反共宣传。工党面临着对其政策的越见扩大的不满，害怕在选举中会遭受失败。但英舰侵华事件却受到一切头脑清醒的英国人的揭破。甚至香港的英国商人也在责难英国政府冒险的侵华举动，据法新社香港二十三日电称：“这些人诘难英方声言英国军舰有权在长江航行的说法。他们指出，中共已公开宣布国民党所缔结的一切协定无效，他们将英国在这时候（其时，共军已兵临长江，且已发动一个旨在占领全中国的总攻势）决定派军舰到长江一举形容为拙劣举动。”
