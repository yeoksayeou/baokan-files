North China New Democratic Youth League
    First Congress Opens Today
  　Unified Leadership Structure for All of North China to be Established
    [Reported by this newspaper] The first congress of the China New Democratic Youth League in North China opened in Ping (Beiping) today (April 2nd).
    The China New Democratic Youth League is a mass organization of advanced youth under the political leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, resolutely fighting for New Democracy. As early as October 1946, North China began experimental league building in Pingshan, Chahar, and Dingxian in the Central Hebei region. Because advanced youth in the old liberated areas of North China played a significant role in supporting the war and developing production, they had long desired to establish their own organization to exert greater strength and seek greater progress. By October 1947, the experimental league building had achieved results, proving that the broad masses of youth needed organization and leadership. Subsequently, during the land redistribution movement, focus was still placed on league building in Dingxian, Xinle, Pingshan, and other places. After a year, the results were good, and more experience was gained. By September 1948, there were approximately 15,000 Youth League members in various parts of North China, fundamentally establishing that league building must be given due importance. Last September, representatives from regions that had already established leagues and representatives from various North China Party, government, and military organs convened the North China Youth Congress, establishing the North China Preparatory Committee of the China New Youth League. In the past six months, league building has begun to spread widely from points to the surface. Currently, league organizations have begun to appear in the Central Hebei region and other areas of North China, in cities such as Shijiazhuang, and in vast rural areas, government offices, factories, and schools. There are more than 40,000 league members, who have played an active role in joining the army, supporting the front, production, and learning. The best performing region in league building is the Central Hebei region, with over 20,000 league members, accounting for approximately half of North China. Dingxian is the most successful at the county level, with over 5,000 league members, and Shijiazhuang has gained more experience at the city level.
    In order to further develop the New Democratic Youth League in North China, it is necessary to establish a unified leadership structure for the Youth League throughout North China. Therefore, representatives have been nominated from various regions to attend today's congress. Today, Comrade Bo Yibo, representative of the North China Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party, and representatives from the preparatory committee of the National Congress of the China New Democratic Youth League will deliver speeches.

    首届代表会今日开幕
  　将建立全华北统一领导机构
    【本报讯】中国新民主主义青年团华北第一届代表大会，今日（四月二日）在平开幕。
    中国新民主主义青年团，是在中国共产党政治领导下，坚决为新民主主义而斗争的先进青年的群众性的组织。华北早在一九四六年十月，即开始在察哈尔的平山，冀中区的定县等地，进行试验性的建团，因为华北老解放区各地区先进青年，在支援战争，发展生产中起了很大的作用，他们早有建立自己组织的要求，以便发挥更大力量，求得更多进步。至一九四七年十月，试验建团有了成绩，证明广大青年是需要组织，需要领导的。接着，在平分土地运动中，仍在定县、新乐、平山等地，实行重点建团，一年后成绩良好，得到经验更多，至一九四八年九月，华北各地青年团员，约有一万五千，基本上确定建团是必须加以应有的重视。去年九月，各地区已建立团的地区及华北党政军机关各派代表，召开了华北青年代表大会，成立中国新青团华北筹委会。半年来由点及面，开始普遍建团。现华北冀中等地区，石家庄等城市及广大农村、机关、工厂、学校等都开始有了团的组织，共有团员四万多。在参军、支前、生产、学习中都起了积极的作用。建团成绩最好者，地区以冀中区为首，有团员二万多，约占华北一半。县团以定县最有成绩，有团员五千多，城市以石家庄获得经验较多。
    为了更进一步发展华北的新民主主义青年团，需要建立全华北青年团的统一领导机构，因此各地区推派代表，出席今日召开的代表大会。今日大会将有中国共产党华北局代表薄一波同志及中国新民主主义青年团全国代表大会筹委会代表讲话。
