　　A Few Words
  　Learning the Resolutions of the Second Plenary Session

    The resolutions of the Second Plenary Session of the Party have been published in summary form, and some places have also conveyed them. We should seize the time to organize learning, and we should take it as the main content of our current study.

    Handan first reviewed its work in the learning mobilization. This method is good. In our study, we must all connect with our own thoughts and work to conduct inspections. Check: Are there any deviations in your understanding of the current situation? Is your understanding or arrangement of the Party's work focus correct? Do you have a complete line of thought of "relying on the working class, uniting other working people, winning over intellectuals, and winning over as many petty bourgeoisie, liberal bourgeoisie, and other people who can cooperate with the Communist Party as possible to stand on the same front, in order to carry out a resolute struggle against imperialists, Kuomintang reactionaries, and bureaucratic bourgeoisie"? Do you have any feelings of pride and complacency? When others are praising you without principle, have you fallen into their trap of softening you up? What is your view on China's economic recovery?… Only by connecting with reality and conducting self-examination in this way can we avoid quibbling over words or circling around nouns, can we deeply understand the essence of the document, and can we truly and freely use the document to guide our work. We hope that all regions will enthusiastically launch the study of the resolutions of the Second Plenary Session, and we hope to understand the insights gained from the study in various regions and the specific experiences and applications in practical work.

　　三言两语
  　学习二中全会决议
    党的二中全会决议，已择要公布，有的地方并作了传达，我们应抓紧组织学习，应将它作为我们目前学习的主要内容。
    邯郸在学习动员中，首先检讨了自己的工作。这种办法是好的。我们在学习中，都必须连系自己的思想与工作，进行检查。检查一下：你对目前形势的认识上有无偏差？你对党的工作重心的认识或安排上是否正确？有无“依靠工人阶级，团结其他劳动群众，争取知识分子，争取尽可能多的能够和共产党合作的小资产阶级、自由资产阶级及其他人物站在一条战线上，以便向帝国主义者、国民党反动派和官僚资产阶级作坚决的斗争”这样完整的路线思想？有无骄傲自满情绪？在旁人无原则向你捧场时，是否上了人家软化的圈套？你对中国经济复兴看法如何？………只有这样连系实际，进行自我检讨，才不会咬文嚼字或在名词上打圈子，才能深刻体会文件的精神实质，真正驾驶自如的运用文件去指导自己的工作。我们希望各地热烈展开关于二中全会决议的学习，我们希望了解各地学习中的心得与在实际工作中的具体体会与运用。
