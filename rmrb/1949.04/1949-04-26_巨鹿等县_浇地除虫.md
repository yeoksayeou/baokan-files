[Jinan Electric] In Julu Third District, Jinzhuzhai, Nanyan Chi, Dongguocheng, Majiaying and the vicinity of Duankaiying in the Fourth District, wheat seedlings have been infested with small red insects. Black small insects have also been discovered in Qiu County. After the local government discovered this, they immediately took various measures to organize the masses to eliminate the insects. The Julu Third District government used ditch digging and irrigation to eliminate wheat worms, leading the masses to dig ditches and irrigate more than 200 mu of land, covering 100 hectares of wheat seedlings. In the irrigated areas, all the insects were drowned, and the wheat seedlings revived. Currently, the masses are actively digging ditches and diverting water for large-scale irrigation. The masses in Duankaiying, Fourth District, are using copper basins to catch insects along the wheat rows. Wangqing Village in Jize First District is using river water to irrigate wheat. In Yuanchao Fifth District, many villages are universally weeding wheat fields, effectively preventing insect and drought disasters.

[Chahar News] In San Yan Tong and Guo Village areas of the Fifth District of Mancheng County, insects have grown on the wheat leaves, resembling red spiders on cotton leaves. The local masses are currently using methods such as watering and weeding to prevent and control them. The Chahar Provincial People's Government has also ordered the Xiling Farm to send personnel to supervise the work. In addition, in the Ninth District of Jingxing County in the Jianping Special District, many villages have experienced jujube curculio insects, which have severely damaged the newly grown tender jujube buds. The county should organize the masses to quickly strike and eliminate the insects to avoid losses.

    【察哈尔讯】满城县五区三阎童、郭村一带麦叶上长了虫子，形状好象棉花叶上红砂闹一样，当地群众现正用水浇、锄等办法防治。察省人民政府并令西陵农场赶紧派人督导。另外，建屏专区井陉县九区，有好多村庄发生了枣步曲虫，把新长的嫩枣芽吃得不轻。该县应组织群众迅速扑打，以免遭受损害。
