Xinhua News Agency, Peiping, April 25th: The people of Peiping continue to voice their angry protests against the aggressive atrocities of British imperialist warships that intruded into China's inland waterways and shelled the defense areas of the Chinese People's Liberation Army. The entire workforce of the Telecommunications Bureau, over 3,000 people, issued a letter of protest stating: "We warn all imperialists, be they British imperialists or American imperialists, that as long as they invade the Chinese people, the Chinese people will use their strength to strike them head-on." The Workers' Union of the 70th Ordnance Factory stated: Any attempt by imperialists to help the Kuomintang reactionaries stop the victorious advance of the People's Liberation Army is impossible, and Chinese workers will never allow them to do so. Workers from the Garment General Factory, Fuxiang Printing Factory, 320 Automobile Factory, and other factories all expressed their indignation at the aggressive actions of the British warships. Student unions from Tsinghua University, Peking University, Normal University, and Yenching University also issued serious protests to British imperialism.
