Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, 25th—War criminal Bandit Bai Chongxi is frantically destroying construction and materials in the area north of the Yangtze River, and is actively planning and deploying destruction on the south bank of the Yangtze River. Currently, on the Pinghan Railway between Changtaiguan and Xiaogan, various important projects have been extensively damaged. All highways, bridges of all sizes, and various buildings, even telephone poles, between Huangpi and Yichang have been thoroughly destroyed. Following the shipment of six tons of explosives on the 3rd of this month, a large amount of blasting equipment is being transported north from Hankou to be used to blow up the Shekou Bridge north of Hankou and completely destroy all projects at the southern end of the Pinghan Railway. Bandit Bai has also ordered his troops to divert water to flood all highways and completely destroy ferryboats and dock facilities. On the south bank of the Yangtze River, the destruction of the Miluo Bridge on the Yuehan Railway is also being prepared. A large amount of explosives is being transported north from Guangzhou, and the 8th Engineer Regiment of Bai Chongxi's troops has been ordered to leave one battalion to carry out this heinous plan. Although the People's Liberation Army has issued repeated warnings, the incorrigibly evil Bandit Bai Chongxi continues to carry out a series of large-scale destructions. On the morning of the 1st of this month, Bandit Bai first blew up the Changtaiguan Huaihe River iron bridge. The bridge was 455 meters long with 14 spans, of which 12 spans were completely destroyed, with only two spans remaining at the northern end. On the same afternoon, the Shuanghe iron bridge south of Xinyang was also blown up, with all nine spans destroyed. At 4 p.m. on the 2nd, Bandit Bai even blew up the famous massive project, the Wushengguan Tunnel on the Pinghan Railway. The northern end of the tunnel was most severely damaged, with the southern end less so. The tunnel was filled with one old and one new locomotive and four fully loaded stone cars. On the 4th, before fleeing, the Kuomintang bandit troops completely destroyed the station buildings in Wangjiadian and Huayuan, and the large and small iron bridges north and south of Huayuan were also completely blown up at the same time, with one-third of the telephone poles along the line destroyed. In mid-month, the Kuomintang bandit troops in Xiaogan also completely destroyed the station and the Xiaobai River iron bridge east of the area. In order to thoroughly destroy the highways in various places, Bandit Bai ordered his troops to destroy the road surface and roadbed as much as possible. Deep and wide ditches have been dug along the highway section from Hengshan north of Huangpi to Baimugang, and all the bridges in that section have been burned down. Although any destruction by war criminal Bai Chongxi cannot stop the victorious advance of the People's Liberation Army, and the People's Liberation Army has surged across the Yangtze River in the middle and lower reaches, the heinous crimes of Bandit Bai must be accounted for. If Bai Chongxi does not immediately stop the destruction and continues to the end, the People's Liberation Army will pursue and capture the criminal and impose severe punishment.

　　白匪崇禧怙恶不悛
  　疯狂破坏人民财产
  　如不停止罪行我军将予严惩
    【新华社北平二十五日电】战犯白匪崇禧正疯狂地破坏长江北岸地区的建设和物资，并积极计划和布置对长江南岸的破坏。现平汉路自长台关至孝感间的各种重要工程已被大量破坏，黄陂和宜昌间的各公路，大小桥梁和各种建筑，甚至电线电杆都被尽情摧毁。继本月三日运出六吨炸药后，大量的爆破器材正源源自汉口北运，准备用以炸毁汉口以北的滠口大桥和彻底破坏平汉路南端的全部工程。白匪并已命令所部引水淹没各公路和全部破坏轮渡船只和码头设施。长江南岸，对粤汉路的汩罗桥的破坏也正准备中。大量的炸药正自广州北运，白崇禧所部工兵八团已奉令留一个营以执行这一罪恶的计划。虽然人民解放军已提出多次警告，怙恶不悛的白匪崇禧仍继续进行了一连串的大规模的破坏。在本月一日上午，白匪首先炸毁了长台关淮河大铁桥。该桥全长四百五十五米，共十四孔，有十二孔全毁，仅残存北头两孔。同日下午，又炸毁信阳以南的双河铁桥，该桥九孔全毁。二日下午四时，白匪更炸毁了著名的巨大工程平汉铁路武胜关大隧道。隧道北端被毁最重，南端较轻。隧道内填塞新旧机车各一，满装石子的车皮四节。四日，国民党匪军逃窜前，将王家店、花园的车站建筑完全破坏，花园南北的大小铁桥也同时全部炸毁，沿路电线杆破坏三分之一。本月中旬，孝感国民党匪军又将车站和该地以东的小白河铁桥全部炸毁。为彻底破坏各地公路，白匪曾令所部须尽量掘毁路面、路基。黄陂北横山至白木岗段的公路沿路已挖了深宽的沟壕，该段桥梁全部烧毁。虽然战犯白崇禧的任何破坏，都阻挡不住人民解放军的胜利前进，人民解放军已于长江中下游汹涌渡江，但白匪的穷凶极恶的罪行，必须清算。如果白崇禧再不立即停止破坏，而继续到底，则人民解放军必将追获该犯，予以严厉的惩办。
