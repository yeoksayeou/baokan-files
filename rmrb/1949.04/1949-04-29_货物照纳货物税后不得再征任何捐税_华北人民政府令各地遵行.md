　　Goods Tax Paid on Goods Precludes Any Further Taxes
　　North China People's Government Orders Compliance from All Localities

　　[This newspaper reports] The North China People's Government issued an order on April 14th to all administrative offices, provincial, and municipal governments: No further goods tax may be levied in any locality on goods that have already duly paid goods tax. The order states: "According to a report from the Tianjin Yizhong Cigarette Company, the cigarettes produced by the company are sold to Cangzhou, Shijiazhuang, and other places. Recently, we have heard that the people's governments of these two places are levying taxes on the cigarettes that have already paid the goods tax." According to the principle of no double taxation in our region, and the provisions of the draft tax regulations, all kinds of goods produced in our region, which have been duly paid goods tax to our tax authorities, shall be allowed to be freely sold in our region without any further taxation or levies, except for alcohol in restricted sales areas. Products from newly liberated cities (such as Beijing, Tianjin, Zhangjiakou, Tangshan, etc.), whether they are publicly, privately, or foreign-owned, should all be regarded as domestic products. Yizhong cigarettes that have already been taxed with the goods exit tax should be handled by all localities in accordance with the above principles.
