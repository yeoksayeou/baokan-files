　　Expand Planting of Cash Crops
  　Jinnan Inspects Planting Plans
    Intensive Mobilization and Problem Solving Exceeds Planned Targets; General Appeals and Simple Orders Render Plans Formalistic.
    [Jinnan Dispatch] The Jinnan District's massive plan to expand the acreage of cash crops is being actively promoted. In areas where the work is being done well, the planting plans for cash crops set by farmers exceed the figures required by higher authorities. In the first district, Yuanchao County's peanut planting plan exceeds the target required by higher authorities (140,000 mu) by 70,000 mu. In the fourth district, Ningnan County's cotton planting plan exceeds the task by one time. Planting can begin as soon as the season arrives.
    Since the Jinnan Party Representatives Conference ended on February 25, in order to seize the season, all localities have advanced the planting plan to the villages by the end of February, and then convened cadre meetings to convey the spirit of the Party Congress and inspect the implementation of the planting plan. The inspection results show that: attaching importance to production leadership, deeply publicizing production policies, specifically solving the masses' ideological concerns and difficulties, especially the leading exemplary role of village cadres and party members, and being good at resolving the contradiction between production and war service, are the key to smoothly completing the task under possible conditions; neglecting leadership, only staying at general appeals or "allocating" figures by simple orders, or even only engaging in war service or still focusing on party consolidation and the conclusion of land reform, will inevitably make the plan become a mere formality. Yuanchao County's districts convened village cadre and party member meetings to conduct production policy education, and each unfolded discussions based on their own personal experiences, formulated individual plans, and publicized to the masses that this year is different from previous years, that rural areas must supply raw materials to urban industries in exchange for daily industrial products, that the government will provide assistance, and that profits will be high, in order to persuade the masses to overcome the conservative thinking caused by the small sales of peanuts in recent years. And by means of specific accounting, the masses' various ideological concerns, such as fearing that peanuts are worthless, that they are labor-intensive, and that there will be a shortage of grain, were dispelled, and farmers were helped to formulate specific plans. At the same time, the masses were led to carry out free lending to solve the seed difficulties. Ren Wen, a party member of Qianshalu in the seventh district, lent out eleven sacks of peanut seeds, solving the seed difficulties of more than 30 households. Chengci County mobilized the masses to formulate production protection covenants, overcoming the masses' concerns about the ease with which cotton and peanuts could be stolen. And loans of 130,000 yuan were provided to solve seed difficulties, resulting in the county exceeding the task by 30,000 mu. After accepting the task from higher authorities, the Mazhuang branch of the second district of Zhentang County made a detailed discussion based on the village's soil quality, the amount of spring land, and whether or not cattle were fed, and smoothly completed the planting plan by deeply mobilizing the masses.
    However, some areas did not do well. For example, when the fifth district conducted inspections in early March, most district cadres' leadership of the planting plan was limited to appeals, and most of them just convened a village cadre meeting, made arrangements, and considered everything to be fine. When some cadres heard the masses' ideological concerns such as fearing that cotton would be worthless after autumn, they one-sidedly emphasized objective difficulties instead of actively mobilizing persuasion and specifically solving the masses' difficulties. Some cadres in Hengshui believed that party consolidation had not been done well, village cadres were not in high spirits, and there was no way to lead production. They ignored the basic achievements of improved awareness of branch party members after party consolidation, and instead of actively correcting certain shortcomings in party consolidation by leading production, they used it as a shield for not attaching importance to production. Some areas put their main strength, or even all their strength, on war service or focusing on ending party consolidation and land reform, and relaxed production leadership. Based on the above situation, when convening cadre meetings to convey the spirit of the Jinnan Party Representatives Conference, all counties thoroughly discussed the leadership of spring plowing production, and made specific inspections of the planting plan, emphasizing publicity and mobilization, solving the specific difficulties of the masses, with party members taking the lead, and improving the organization (especially at the village level), and proposed to overcome and prevent the two tendencies of simple orders and laissez-faire, and on the basis of continuing to implement inspections to achieve the planting plan, further carry out the spring plowing movement.

　　扩大播种经济作物
  　冀南检查种植计划
    深入动员解决困难超过预定任务，一般号召简单命令计划流于形式。
    【冀南电】冀南区扩大经济作物播种面积的巨大计划，正积极推行中，工作做得好的地区，农民所订种植经济作物计划，超过上级要求的数字。一专区元朝县种花生计划超过上级要求的数字（十四万亩）七万亩，四专区宁南县种棉计划超过任务一倍。一待节令到来，即可播种。
    自二月二十五日冀南党代表会议结束后，为了抓紧季节，各地均提前把种植计划于二月底布置到村，然后再召开干部会议，传达党代会精神，并检查种植计划执行情形。检查结果认为：重视生产领导，深入宣传生产政策，具体解决群众思想顾虑和困难，特别是村干部党员的带头模范作用及善于解决生产与战勤的矛盾，是在可能条件下顺利完成任务的重要关键；忽视领导，只停留在一般号召或以简单命令“配给”数字，甚至只搞战勤或仍以整党与结束土改为中心，势必使计划流于形式。元朝县各区召开村干党员会议进行生产政策教育，并各以自己的切身体验展开讨论，订出个人计划，并向群众宣传今年与往年不同，农村要供给城市工业原料交换日用工业品，政府扶助，获利大，以说服群众因近年来花生销路不大而产生的保守思想。并以具体算帐方式，解除群众怕花生不值钱、费工大、怕缺粮食等各种思想顾虑，帮助农民具体订出计划，同时带领群众开展自由借贷以解决种籽困难。七区前沙路党员任文等贷出花生种籽十一口袋，解决了三十多户群众的种籽困难。成磁县发动群众订立保护生产公约，克服了群众怕种棉花、花生容易被人偷的顾虑。并贷款十三万元解决种籽困难，结果全县超过任务三万亩。振堂县二区马庄支部接受上级任务后，根据本村的土质、春地多少、喂牛与否等条件作了详细讨论，深入动员群众，顺利完成了种植计划。
    但是，有的地区就做得不好，如五专区三月上旬检查时，大部区干部对种植计划的领导只限于号召，多是开个村干会布置下去就万事大吉。某些干部听到群众怕秋后棉花不值钱等思想顾虑后，片面强调客观困难，而不从积极方面进行动员说服，具体解决群众困难。衡水有些干部认为，整党没整好，村干情绪不高，没法领导生产。忽视整党后支部党员觉悟提高的基本成绩，对整党中某些缺点，不去积极的从领导生产中纠正，反而作为不重视生产的挡箭牌。有些地区却把主要力量甚至全部力量放在战勤或以结束整党土改为中心，而放松生产领导。根据以上情况，各县在召开干部会议传达冀南党代表会议精神时，均详细研讨了春耕生产的领导问题，并对种植计划作了具体检查，强调宣传动员，解决群众的具体困难，以党员带头，健全组织（特别是村级），并提出克服与防止简单命令和放任自流两种倾向，在继续贯彻检查实现种植计划的基础上，进一步开展春耕运动。
