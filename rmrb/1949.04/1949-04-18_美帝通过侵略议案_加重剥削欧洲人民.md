　　US Imperialism Passes Aggression Bill
  　Intensifying Exploitation of European People
    [News Dispatch] Xinhua News Agency dispatch from Washington via US News Service: The US Senate and House Joint Committee passed a compromise bill on the 13th, continuing the appropriation for the Marshall Aggression Plan (European Recovery Program), stipulating $5.43 billion as the implementation fund for the next fifteen months (from April 3 this year to June 30 next year). In addition, a provision is attached, stipulating that half of the materials transported to Europe under this plan must still be shipped by American vessels, thereby intensifying the exploitation of "recipient" countries. Furthermore, in order to encourage the export of American private capital, a fund of $150 million is approved as a guarantee for American private capital to invest in "recipient" countries. The compromise bill was approved by the Senate and House of Representatives on the 14th and has been sent to the White House. As of April 3 this year, the Marshall "Aid" to Europe plan had allocated $5.055 billion in one year. American monopoly capitalists have used this money, squeezed from the American people, not only to earn huge profits but also to intensify their control over the political and economic life of the "recipient" countries.

　　美帝通过侵略议案
  　加重剥削欧洲人民
    【本报讯】拟新华社报道：美新闻处华盛顿讯：美国参众两院联席会议，十三日通过了继续执行马歇尔侵略计划（援助欧洲复兴计划）拨款的折衷案，规定以五十四亿三千万美元为今后十五个月（今年四月三日至明年六月三十日）的实施经费。此外，并附加一项规定，即根据此项计划运往欧洲之物资，其半数仍由美轮装运，借以加重对“受援”国之剥削。且为鼓励美国私人资本输出，特核准一亿五千万美元基金作为美国私人资本向受“援”国投资的保证。该折衷案十四日已由参众两院批准，并已送交白宫。按迄今年四月三日为止的一年中，马歇尔“援”欧计划拨款为五十亿五千五百万美元。美国垄断资本家利用这一笔由美国人民身上剥削来的钱，不但赚取了巨额利润，而且加紧控制了受“援”国家的政治和经济生活。
