　　The Beiping People's Court Answers Questions Regarding Litigation and Case Acceptance
    We have recently received numerous letters from readers in various regions, inquiring about matters related to litigation and case acceptance by the People's Court. Our newspaper's social services team specially interviewed the person in charge of the Beiping Municipal People's Court, who kindly provided the following answers:

    Q: What are the fundamental differences between the Beiping Municipal People's Court and the courts of the Kuomintang reactionaries?

    A: The People's Court is the court of the people themselves. It is an organ of the people, who have seized political power, to protect themselves against the overthrown landlords, compradors, and bureaucrat-capitalists. The Kuomintang reactionary court was an anti-people court, a tool for the landlord, comprador, and bureaucrat-capitalist classes to rule over the broad masses of the working people.

    Q: What principles does the People's Court base its judgments on? Why was the Kuomintang reactionary "Six Codes" abolished?

    A: Law has class character. The Kuomintang reactionaries' "Six Codes" served the Kuomintang ruling class. We have overthrown the Kuomintang reactionary class, and of course, we must abolish this anti-people "law." Before the people's new laws are fully promulgated, the People's Court will base its judgments on the various political programs, laws, orders, regulations, and resolutions issued by the People's Government and the People's Liberation Army. In the absence of specific provisions, the case will be handled in accordance with the New Democratic policies.

    Q: What is the scope of cases accepted by the Beiping Municipal People's Court?

    A: The People's Court will accept any facts that infringe upon the interests of the people, the state, and society.

    Q: Do people need an introduction from the district government to file a lawsuit in court? Are litigation fees charged? Is it necessary to go through a lawyer? What if someone doesn't know how to write a complaint?

    A: Both written and oral complaints are acceptable, no introduction is needed, and no litigation fees are charged. No lawyer is required. You can go to the drafting room of the Municipal People's Court for free drafting assistance.

    Q: The People's Government implements a lenient policy. Should leniency also be extended to bad people who have committed many evils with clear evidence? Can the people file lawsuits against them? What should be done if bad people who have been released after education still do not reform?

    A: The People's Government is lenient towards criminals who genuinely show repentance and self-renewal, appropriately reducing the punishment they deserve for their crimes. However, this does not mean that criminals will not be punished at all. As for those who have committed many evils and are intolerable to the people, the People's Government will certainly severely suppress them. The masses can file lawsuits, and the People's Court will sentence them. If those released after education do not reform, they can be re-sentenced by the People's Court as long as there are new criminal facts.

    Q: Recently, regarding some divorce issues, must they be adjudicated by law? Can the district government mediate?

    A: The district government can mediate. If mediation is successful, it is as effective as a judgment. If mediation fails, you are still free to file a lawsuit in court.

    Q: What are the time regulations for the People's Court to accept cases? Where can people go to ask if they have questions about litigation?

    A: Cases are accepted at any time from 8:00 AM to 12:00 PM and 2:00 PM to 5:00 PM daily (except Sundays). If you have any questions about litigation, you can go to the inquiry office of the Municipal People's Court.

　　北平人民法院解答　关于诉讼与受理案件诸问题
    我们最近不断收到各地读者来信，询问有关人民法院诉讼及受理案件诸问题，本报社会服务组特专访北平市市政府人民法院负责人，承其发表谈话如下：
    问：北平市人民法院与国民党反动派时代的法院基本不同点在哪里？
    答：人民法院是人民自己的法院，是人民掌握了政权，为着保护自己反对已被推翻了的地主、买办、官僚资本家的反动机构。国民党反动法院是反人民的法院，它是地主、买办、官僚资本家统治广大劳动人民的工具。
    问：人民法院判决案件，根据什么原则？国民党反动的“六法全书”为什么废除？
    答：法律是有阶级性的，国民党反动派的“六法全书”是为国民党统治阶级服务的。我们推翻了国民党反动阶级，当然要取消这种反人民的“法律”。在人民的新法律没有完全颁布以前，人民法院判案以人民政府、人民解放军所发布的各种政治纲领、法律、命令、条例、决议的规定为依据。没有规定的，就根据新民主主义的政策来办理。
    问：北平市人民法院受理诉讼的范围是什么？
    答：只要是侵犯人民和国家、社会利益的事实，人民法院都予受理。
    问：人民到法院诉讼是否必须由区政府介绍？收不收讼费？是否还要经过律师？有的不会写状纸怎么办？
    答：书状起诉、口头起诉都可以，不要介绍，也不收讼费。不需要什么律师。可到市人民法院代书室免费代书。
    问：人民政府实行宽大政策，对有证有据作恶多端的坏人是否也要宽大？人民能不能起诉？经教育释放之坏人，至今不改应如何办？
    答：人民政府对确实表现悔过自新的犯人是宽大的，将他罪恶应得处分酌予减轻，而不是说犯了罪可以不处分。至于作恶多端为人民所不容的，人民政府一定严予镇压，群众可起诉，由人民法院判罪。经教育释放不改的，只要有新的犯罪事实，可重由人民法院判罪。
    问：最近有些离婚问题，是否必须经法律判决？区政府可否调解？
    答：区政府可以调解，调解成立，与判决同样有效。如调解不成立，仍可自由到法院起诉
    问：人民法院受理案件的时间如何规定？人民对诉讼有不明白的地方到哪里去问？
    答：每日上午八时至十二时，下午二时至五时（星期日例外），随时受理。对诉讼有不明白的问题，可到市人民法院问事处去问。
