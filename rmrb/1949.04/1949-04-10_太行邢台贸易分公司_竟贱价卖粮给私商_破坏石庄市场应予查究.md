　　Taihang Xingtai Trading Branch
  　Actually Sells Grain to Private Merchants at Low Prices
  　Disrupting Shijiazhuang Market; Investigation and Punishment Should Be Pursued
    [Shijiazhuang News] The Taihang Trading Company's Xingtai branch violated trade policies by privately selling large quantities of millet to private merchants in Shijiazhuang at low prices, without going through the city's public institutions. This has fostered the exploitation of the people by speculators. On the 13th of this month, the Taihang Trading Company's Xingtai branch, in urgent need of funds, ordered Xu Ershun, a cadre at the Yuanshi Macun (40 li from Shijiazhuang) warehouse, to dump large quantities of millet. Xu found Kang Quanshùn, who ran a restaurant locally, to help with sales. Kang rushed to Shijiazhuang that day and went to Jin Feng Grain Store late that night to promote the sale, saying that a certain company had 400,000 jin of millet to sell at low prices, 10 yuan per jin, which was 2 yuan lower than the market price in Shijiazhuang that day. Jin Feng Grain Store felt that it was profitable and immediately rushed to buy 100,000 jin, and resold it to 18 grain stores and grain dealers including Tonghe, Hongxing, and Maoji at 10.8 yuan per jin. In the middle of the night, Kang Quanshùn went to Jin Feng Grain Store again, saying that he had discussed it with the company over the phone, and 10 yuan per jin was too cheap, and it would have to be raised to 10.05 yuan. Jin Feng calculated that the profit was still very large, and readily agreed. The first batch of rice arrived on the 15th, and Jin Feng immediately bought 7,000 jin at 11.5 yuan per jin for the Shijiazhuang Trading Company.
    At the same time, Ma Xueqian, a guest staying at the Daxing Che Dian (carriage shop) in Shijiazhuang, was a clerk at the Xingtai Jucheng Freight Forwarding, and because he was familiar with the company, he also bought 50,000 jin at 10.05 yuan per jin. Ma resold it to Cao Yanhe, the owner of Daxing Che Dian, at the original price, explaining that he was taking a one-cent commission. Daxing then approached Yucheng Gong Freight Forwarding, asking 11.3 yuan per jin. While the contract was being negotiated, the Shijiazhuang Trading Company discovered this matter and sent personnel to Macun on the 16th to prevent the merchants from continuing to pick up the rice. However, at that time, Xu Ershun, for the sake of his so-called "credit," was unwilling to accept the advice to stop the rice pickup, and allowed the merchants to take away more than 10,000 jin of rice that had been packaged. Including the previous time, a total of 55,953 jin were taken away, and the remaining 40,000 jin and Ma Xueqian's 50,000 jin were all returned.
    Fortunately, this incident was discovered early, and it did not develop into a major loss. However, the Taihang Trading Company's Xingtai branch's violation of discipline should be investigated and punished.
    In addition, Jin Feng Grain Store failed to report 4,742.23 yuan in grain tax in this transaction. After being discovered by the Shijiazhuang Tax Bureau, in addition to ordering it to pay the tax, a fine of twice the amount, totaling 9,484.46 yuan, was imposed. Kang Quanshùn is a restaurant owner in Yuanshi, Ma Xueqian is a freight forwarding merchant in Xingtai, and Cao Yanhe is the owner of a carriage shop. They did not have a transaction certificate to conduct transactions, disrupting market order, and should be thoroughly investigated and given due punishment.

　　太行邢台贸易分公司
  　竟贱价卖粮给私商
  　破坏石庄市场应予查究
    【石家庄讯】太行贸易公司邢台分公司违反贸易政策，不经过石市公营机构介绍，私自低价售给石市私商大批小米，以致助长了投机商人对人民的剥削。本月十三日太行贸易公司邢台分公司因急于用款命令元氏马村（离石市四十里）仓库干部徐二顺大量抛售小米。徐找到当地开饭馆的康全顺请代推销，康当天赶到石家庄，连晚到晋丰粮店推销，说某公司有四十万斤小米要低价抛售，每斤十元，比当天石市市价每斤低二元。晋丰粮店感到有利可图，即连夜奔走先买了十万斤，并以每斤十元八角转售给同和、宏兴、茂记等十八个粮店及粮贩；半夜，康全顺又到晋丰粮店，说和某公司电话里商量了一下，十元一斤太便宜，要涨到十元零五角，晋丰算算利润仍然很大，就满口答应了。十五号第一批米运到，晋丰一转手就以十一元五角一斤买了七千斤给石市贸易公司。
    与此同时，住在石市大兴车店的客人马学谦是邢台聚成货栈的伙计，因与该公司相熟，也以十元零五角一斤分购了五万斤，马又以原价转给大兴车店掌柜曹延鹤，说明吃一分佣钱，大兴又去找裕成公货栈，每斤要价十一元三角。正在议订合同时，石市贸易公司发觉了此事，于十六日派员前往马村阻止商人们继续取米，但当时徐二顺为了自己所谓的“信用”，不愿接受阻止取米的意见，让商人将一万多斤打好包的米取走了。连前次共取了五万五千九百五十三斤，其余四万多斤及马学谦的五万斤全部退回。
    这次事件幸而发现还早，汉有演成重大损失。但太行贸易公司邢台分公司的违反纪律行为应予查究。
    另晋丰粮店在此次交易中漏报粮税四千七百四十二元二角三分，经石市税务局查获后，除令其补纳并罚款两倍，计九千四百八十四元四角六分。康全顺是元氏开饭馆的，马学谦是邢台货栈商人，曹延鹤是大车店掌柜，没有交易证进行交易，破坏市场秩序，应追究清楚，予以应得处罚。
