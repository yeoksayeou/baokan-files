　　Manager of Mentougou Coal Industry Water Control Company
  　Owes Workers a Year's Wages

To the Honorable Editor:

    With indignation, we wish to borrow a corner of your esteemed newspaper to accuse Yin Yaoguang, the former manager, and ○…○ Yin Xiushan, the current manager, of the private Mentougou Coal Industry Water Control Company, for exploiting and oppressing poor employees.

    We are a group of employees of this coal company. In the past, our monthly wages were barely enough to make ends meet. Later, because General Manager Yin Yaoguang mixed public and private affairs, using his authority to engage in other businesses, he claimed that the company could not afford to pay us and stopped paying our salaries from April last year. In September of last year, when the new manager, Yin Xiushan, took over, not only was the old debt of wages not cleared, but as of now, another half-year of new wages is owed. Even meals have long been stopped. During this year, we initially borrowed from here and there, then could not borrow any more, and now we are suffering from hunger and cold, living from day to day. However, they are still eating and drinking lavishly, living a luxurious life. Although we have repeatedly explained our difficulties to them, requesting them to raise and pay the accumulated wages and meal expenses, they not only did not provide a satisfactory solution but instead gave cold and irresponsible words. We know that this unreasonable phenomenon is not allowed to exist in Peiping after liberation. Therefore, we boldly bring it up and appeal to you for help and guidance:

    1. Are the wages of the employees, which are purely the price of labor and sweat, reasonable to demand back from them?
    2. Should the former manager, who engaged in other businesses in less than a year of service and is now a plump wealthy man, be jointly responsible with the current manager for clearing the owed wages to employees?
    3. What methods should be used to negotiate with them? Which agency should we appeal to?

　　　　　　　　　　Representative of Employees of Mentougou Coal Industry Water Control Company, Zhang Yongqiang, et al.

To Mr. Zhang Yongqiang:

    As the situation described in the letter shows, the capitalist's behavior is clearly violating the People's Government's policy of taking into account both public and private interests, and benefiting both labor and capital in industry and commerce. It is reasonable to demand the owed wages back from them. We suggest that you go to the industry department of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions and ask them to investigate, study, and mediate.

### 门头沟煤业治水公司经理　拖欠工人一年工资未还

　　门头沟煤业治水公司经理
  　拖欠工人一年工资未还编辑先生：
    我们以愤懑的心情，想借贵报一角之地，来控诉这一剥削压迫贫苦职工的私营门头沟煤业治水公司前任经理殷尧光及○……○现任经理殷秀山。
    我们这一群是该煤业公司的职工，过去每月工资仅够糊口，后因总经理殷尧光公私不分，擅用职权，兼营他业，借口公司不能开支，自去年四月份起，即停止发给我们薪金。至去年九月，新任经理殷秀山接事后，不但对于旧欠工资迄未清理，且截至目前为止，新欠工资又将半年。甚至伙食也早经停止。在此一年中，我们始则东挪西借，继而告贷无门，近更饥寒交迫，朝不保夕；而彼等则仍大吃大喝，生活奢华。我们虽经屡次向他们申述困难，要求筹发积欠工资及饭费，而他们不但不给圆满解决，反而冷言冷语，说些不负责任的话。此种不合理的现象，我们知道在解放后的北平，是不容许存在的。故此大胆提出来吁请先生帮助和指示：
    一、各职工之工资，纯系劳力和血汗的代价，向他们索还，合理否？
    二、前任经理到任不满一年，即兼营他业，现已面团团作富家翁。对于欠发职工工资，应否与现任经理共同负责清偿？
    三、应用何种方法与彼等交涉？向何机关申诉？
    　　　　　　　　　　门头沟煤业治水公司职工代表张永强等张永强君：
    如来信所说情形，资方的行为显然是违背人民政府公私兼顾，劳资两利的工商业政策，向他们索还积欠工资是合理的。我们建议你到市总工会行业部请他们调查、研究、调解。　                　——编者
