Xinhua News Agency, Bengbu, 18th: From the lower reaches of the Yellow River to the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, railway, highway, major roads, small paths, waterways, and river channels are teeming with transportation workers and vehicles. The entire logistics personnel of the Third Field Army, with the support of the broad masses of the people, are working day and night to complete transportation tasks with great intensity. Sufficient ammunition, grain, oil, salt, and other materials have been delivered to the front lines on schedule and in full quantity; various equipment and supplies have also been concentrated on time; hospitals have prepared large quantities of medicines, materials, bloody uniforms, and bedding; every soldier has been supplemented with new summer uniforms, cartridge bags, rice bags, and three pairs of shoes. Soldiers in a certain unit each carried two days' worth of dry rations. They happily said, "Sesame cakes are sweet and fragrant, we'll cross the Yangtze with full bellies!" Before setting off for transportation, the drivers of the Third Battalion of a certain automobile regiment each set a meritorious service plan. A certain driver wrote his determination on the truck box: "Da Dao Qi (vehicle registration), can carry heavy loads, the engine roars and rushes forward, unafraid of rain, unafraid of wind, complete the task and win first-class merit." During transportation, a certain motorcade got stuck in a muddy ditch. Without shovels, a dozen drivers lay on the wet ground and dug mud with their hands to push the cars out of the ditch. When a car broke down on the road, technician Liu Guicai lay on the wet ground under the car to repair it, ignoring the cold, and finally insisted on repairing it in time to complete the task. When it rained, the cars of the Eighth Company had no rain cloths. Platoon Leader Han Hongqing and others, fearing that the materials would get wet, took off their own cotton-padded clothes and quilts to cover the materials. Driver Yang Deli carefully filtered the gasoline used for washing the engine every time before using it to drive. He said, "A drop of gasoline is a drop of blood. Transporting one more truckload of ammunition means an earlier victory."

　　从黄河到长江车船川流不息
  　日日夜夜紧张运输
    第三野战军后勤人员努力完成任务
    【新华社蚌埠十八日电】从黄河下游到长江下游的所有铁路、公路、大道、小径上和水路、河道中车船员工川流不息。第三野战军全体后勒人员在广大人民的支援下，正日夜紧张地完成运输任务。足够的弹药、粮食、油盐等物资已如期如数送到前方；各种器材、用具亦准时集中；各医院已准备了大批的药品材料和血衣被服；每个战士都补充了新的夏季军服，子弹袋、米袋和三双鞋子。某部战士每人都带了两天的干粮。他们高兴的说：“芝麻烧饼甜又香，吃饱肚子过长江！”某部汽车一团三营驾驶员在未出发输送前，每个人都订了立功计划。某驾驶员在车箱上写着自己的决心：“大道奇（车牌名），能载重，马达一响往前冲，不怕雨，不怕风，完成任务立个头等功。”运输途中，某汽车队陷在泥洼里，没有铲子，十几个驾驶员便伏在湿地上用手来挖泥，把汽车推出泥洼。当一辆汽车在路上发生故障时，技工刘桂材便躺在车底湿地上修理，不顾寒冷，终于坚持修好，及时完成任务。下雨时，八连的汽车没有雨布，排长韩洪庆等恐将物资淋湿，便拿自己身上脱下来的棉衣和棉被盖在物资上。驾驶员杨德利把洗机用过的汽油，每次都仔细滤过一遍，再用来开车，他说：“一滴汽油一滴血，多运一车炮弹，就早胜利一天。”
