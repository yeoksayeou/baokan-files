　　Today's Dictionary
    Realgar—Commonly known as arsenic. In medicine, it's called arsenic oxide and is highly poisonous. Farmers mix it with seeds to kill mole crickets, protecting the young seedlings from being eaten. It has significant uses in medicine, as it is a raw material in famous medicines such as Salvarsan ("606") and ferrous arsenite pills. It appears as a white powder, insoluble in water, but easily soluble in hydrochloric acid. Those poisoned by it can be treated with egg whites, milk, or magnesium oxide.
    Topdressing—Commonly known as seedling fertilizer. When seedlings grow to be over a foot tall, in order to provide them with sufficient nutrients, manure is spread or buried around the roots, which is called topdressing.
    Building Embankments—Also called building banks. When farming hillside land, to prevent rainwater from eroding the soil, the lower areas are built up with stones, and soil is filled in and cultivated. Fields generally have embankments. Every summer, some are inevitably damaged by erosion, so before spring plowing each year, repairs must be carried out, which is called building embankments.
    Fallow Land—In order to nurture the soil and obtain a good harvest, farmers reduce planting for one season after harvesting wheat or autumn crops; therefore, a blank piece of land that is idle for one season is called fallow land.

    信石—俗称砒霜。医药上叫氧化砷，有剧毒。农民将它掺上播种可毒杀蝼蛄，保护小苗不被吃掉。在医药上用处很大，如六○六及亚砒酸铁丸等名药内均含此原料。形状为白色粉末，不溶于水，易溶于盐酸。中此毒者可用鸡蛋白、牛乳或氧化镁解之。
    追肥—俗称苗粪。当青苗长出一尺多高的时候，为使其获得充分养料，再一次将粪撒或埋在苗根，谓之追肥。
    垒堰—也叫垒岸。种山坡地，为了防止雨水将土壤冲刷，就把低处用石块垒起，把土填平耕种，一般田间也都有堰岸。每年夏季不免冲坏一些，所以每到翌年春耕前，须进行一次修整，即谓垒堰。
    白茬地—农民为了调养土质，获得丰收，在收麦或收秋后，少种一季庄稼，因此一季闲着的空白地，就叫白茬地。
