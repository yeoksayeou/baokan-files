Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 2nd: TASS Moscow reports: On March 31st, the Soviet ambassadors to the United States, Britain, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, and Canada delivered a memorandum on the North Atlantic Treaty to the governments of those countries on behalf of the Soviet government. The memorandum strongly condemned the aggressive purpose of the North Atlantic Treaty, its violation of the principles and objectives of the United Nations, and strongly condemned the US, British, and French governments for violating the obligations they undertook in treaties or agreements jointly signed with the Soviet government. After a detailed discussion of the North Atlantic Treaty, the Soviet government concluded as follows:

(1) The North Atlantic Treaty has nothing in common with the purpose of national self-defense. The contracting parties to the treaty are not threatened by any country, and no country is attempting to attack the participating countries of the treaty. On the contrary, this treaty has a clear aggressive nature. Its purpose is to oppose the Soviet Union, and even the official representatives of the North Atlantic Treaty participating countries do not conceal this.

(2) The North Atlantic Treaty is not only not used to consolidate international security, which is the basis of the United Nations organization, but on the contrary, it runs counter to the principles and objectives of the United Nations Charter, and it will lead to the destruction of the United Nations organization.

(3) The North Atlantic Treaty runs counter to the Anglo-Soviet Treaty signed in 1942, in which the two countries undertook the obligation to cooperate in maintaining peace and international security, and "not to conclude any alliances against the other party, nor to participate in any coalition against the other party."

(4) The North Atlantic Treaty runs counter to the Franco-Soviet Treaty signed in 1944. In this treaty, the two countries undertook the obligation to cooperate in maintaining peace and international security, and "not to conclude any alliances against the other party, nor to participate in any coalition against the other party."

(5) The North Atlantic Treaty runs counter to the agreements signed by the representatives of the Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom at Yalta, Potsdam, and other meetings held during and after the Second World War. In these agreements, the United States and Britain, like the Soviet Union, also undertook the obligation to cooperate, consolidate universal peace and international security, and strive to consolidate the United Nations organization.

　　北大西洋公约具有侵略目的
  　苏提备忘录予以严斥
    指责美英法政府违背他们在与苏联
    政府共同签订条约中所承担的义务
    【新华社北平二日电】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：三月三十一日，苏联驻美、英、法、比、荷、卢、加七国大使，代表苏联政府向各该国政府递送一件关于北大西洋公约的备忘录。该备忘录严斥北大西洋公约具有侵略的目的，违背联合国的原则与目标，并严斥美、英、法政府违背他们在与苏联政府共同签订的条约或协定中所承担的义务，在对北大西洋公约作了详尽的论列之后，苏联政府的结论如下：
    （一）北大西洋公约与国家自卫的目的毫无相同之点。该公约的各缔约国，并未受到任何国家的威胁，没有任何一个国家企图进攻该公约的参与国。相反，这一公约具有明显的侵略性质。其目的在于反对苏联，甚至北大西洋公约参加各国的官方代表也并不掩盖这一点。
    （二）北大西洋公约不仅不是用来巩固作为联合国组织之基础的国际安全的，相反，它与联合国宪章的原则与目标背道而驰，它将导向联合国组织的破坏。
    （三）北大西洋公约与一九四二年英苏两国签订的条约背道而驰，在该条约中，两国曾承担共同合作维持和平与国际安全，“决不缔结针对另一方之任何盟约，亦不参加针对另一方之任何联盟”的义务。
    （四）北大西洋公约与一九四四年法苏两国签订的条约背道而驰。两国在该条约中曾承担共同合作维持和平与国际安全，“决不缔结针对另一方之任何盟约，亦不参加针对另一方之任何联盟”的义务。
    （五）北大西洋公约与苏、美、英三国代表在雅尔塔、波茨坦及第二次世界大战中与第二次世界大战结束以后所举行的其他各次会议中签订的协定背道而驰。在这些协定中，美国、英国和苏联一样，也承担了共同合作、巩固普遍和平与国际安全，并为巩固联合国组织而努力的义务。
