　　Xinji Julong Iron Factory

　　Corrects Blind Processing
　　Protects Workers' Health
　　[Our Newspaper] The state-owned Julong Iron Factory in Xinji City, accepting workers' opinions, has stopped blind processing methods that harm workers' health, and has tightened up its work and meeting systems. The factory often found itself in a passive state due to complex and fragmented business and difficulties in planned production. However, the workers were highly conscious and often proactively put forward many constructive opinions on factory management. Starting in July of last year, they assisted the leadership in initially establishing systems for labeling, work recording, and daily production reports. In November, they conducted a "three evaluations" (work, technology, relationships), and the workers made well-intentioned criticisms of the staff. Workers also created many model examples in production, improving production efficiency. In March of this year, they were jointly awarded a "Assist the Leadership, Promote Production" Red Flag by the Jizhong Industrial Company and the Enterprise Trade Union. However, the factory and the trade union had blindly emphasized processing, with some workers going to work while sick and others not resting when injured, leading to excessive fatigue and harm to their health. In addition, leisure activities dragged on for too long, such as classes and meetings, which often failed to grasp the core issues, solve problems, and wasted a lot of energy, affecting workers' interest in attending meetings. After the workers proactively raised these shortcomings and the spirit of the Labor Congress resolutions was conveyed, the staff made a preliminary inspection and immediately cooperated with the trade union to change them. The specific regulations are: (1) No unprepared meetings will be held. (2) Emphasis should be placed on improving technology to increase production, and blind processing should be avoided. (3) Strict adherence to time, arriving promptly when the bell rings and dispersing immediately when the whistle blows. Classes should last no more than forty minutes, group meetings should last one and a half hours for workers, and two hours for staff. (4) The past regulations that wages would not be paid for personal or sick leave have been abolished. (Note: Failure to pay attention to saving workers' energy and simply emphasizing processing was a major shortcoming in last year's Jizhong winter production campaign and should still be noted.)　　　　　　(Yao Fu)

　　辛集聚隆铁厂
  　纠正盲目加工
  　保护工人健康
    【本报讯】辛集市国营聚隆铁工厂接受工人意见，停止妨碍工人健康的盲目加工办法，并严密了工作与开会等制度。该厂由于业务复杂零碎，计划生产比较困难，经常处于被动状态；但工人觉悟很高，经常主动提出工厂管理方面许多建设性的意见。从去年七月开始，曾协助领导上初步建立了挂牌、记工、生产日报等制度。十一月又进行了三评（工作、技术、关系），工人对职员作了善意的批评。工人并在生产中创造了许多模范事例，提高了生产效率，今年三月曾得冀中实业公司与企业总工会共同奖给的“协助领导，推进生产”红旗。但工厂与工会曾有盲目强调加工现象，有的工人带病上工，有的负伤不休息，以至过度疲劳，有害身体健康。另外业余活动时间拖拉过长，如上课、开会，往往抓不住中心，不解决问题，浪费不少精力，影响工人参加会议兴趣。以上缺点经工人们主动提出竟见，及至传达了劳大决议精神后，职员又作了初步检查，立即协同工会加以改变。具体规定：（一）不开无准备的会议。（二）强调改良技术提高生产，不要盲目加工。（三）严格遵守时间，鸣钟即到，吹笛即散，上课最多不过四十分钟，小组会工人一点半，职员两点。（四）过去事假、病假不发工资的规定取消。（按不注意节省工人精力，单纯强调加工，在去年冀中冬季生产运动中，是一个很大的缺点，至今仍应注意。）　　　　　　（药夫）
