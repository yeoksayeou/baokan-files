　　Organizing Temple Fairs Around Production
  　Directives from the Jizhong Administrative Office
    [Reported by this newspaper] The Jizhong Administrative Office, in order to leverage the role of temple fairs in organizing production and to prevent extravagant and wasteful practices during temple fairs, has issued directives to all counties and cities to selectively resume temple fairs, but with the following considerations: 1. Avoid organizing temple fairs for the sake of temple fairs themselves. The purpose should be to promote the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas and to develop production. Prior publicity should be conducted to encourage industrial and commercial businesses to manufacture agricultural implements for farmers to purchase. The organization of temple fairs must be approved by the county government. 2. The organization of temple fairs may be managed by the local Federation of Industry and Commerce or the Market Committee, which should absorb legitimate merchants and upright individuals to form a temple fair management committee. The administration should provide guidance but avoid official management. 3. The expenses of the temple fair should not be borne by the farmers, and the burdens on merchants should also be differentiated. Poor and small vendors may be exempt from contributing. 4. Establish fire prevention and air defense organizations. Provide appropriate care for industrial and commercial businesses coming from afar to attend the fair, such as accommodation and stall setup. 5. Strengthen the management and education of market brokers, and resolutely stop their illegal activities such as speculation and usury. 6. Pay attention to carrying out various publicity efforts. 7. Temple fairs may appear under the names of livestock markets or agricultural merchandise fairs.

　　围绕生产组织庙会
  　冀中行署发指示
    【本报讯】冀中行署为发挥庙会在组织生产中的作用，和必须防止庙会中之铺张浪费现象，特指示各县、市应有重点的恢复庙会，但必须注意：一、避免为庙会而庙会，应以促使城乡物资交流、发展生产为目的，事先应作宣传，使工商户赶制农具供农民购买。组织庙会须经县府批准。二、庙会之组织，可由当地工商联合会或集市委员会主持，吸收正当商人及正派人士组成庙会管理委员会。行政加以指导，但避免官办。三、庙会的开支，农民不负担，对商人的负担也应有所区别，贫苦小商贩也可不出。四、建立防火、防空组织；对远来赶会的工商户，可予以适当照顾；如住宿、设摊等。五、加强管理与教育市场牙纪，坚决制止其倒把、使黑钱等非法行为。六、注意开展各种宣传工作。七、庙会可以骡马大市或农用百货大市名义出现。
