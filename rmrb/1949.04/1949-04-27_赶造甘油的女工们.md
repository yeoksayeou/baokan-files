The Women Workers Rushing to Produce Glycerin

On April 5th, the reporter visited the Glycerin Section of the North China Factory 54. All the workers in the factory are working hard in a combat-ready state to research technology, improve product quality, and support the war at the front. In the office of the Glycerin Section, Si Yumei, a healthy woman around thirty years old, was busy registering attendance records and raw material figures. She joined the factory in 1945, learned many skills diligently, and was promoted to foreman of the Glycerin Section the year before last. She satisfactorily introduced to me many creations of the workers in production, and then she accompanied me to visit every production process.

Entering the conversion team, the female worker Wang Yuzhen was going all out to stir the boiling oil pot, controlling the heat, and constantly watching to prevent the oil from overflowing and wasting raw materials.

"Tired? Can you keep it up?" I tentatively asked her.

"Tired! Of course, it's tiring! Compared to fighting Chiang Kai-shek's reactionaries, what's 'tired'! Every one of us in the factory is tired! It's much easier than the soldiers at the front!" she replied generously.

In the past, each pot in this team could only hold seventy catties of white oil. After the workers modified the conversion pot, the product was expanded three times compared to the original. The year before last, the number of workers per shift was reduced from eight to seven, and after January it was further reduced to five. Not only were they able to complete the task, but they also created a work efficiency of clearing eight and a half pots of semi-finished products (about five or six hundred catties per pot) in nine minutes per shift. In the second production department – the crushing team, the factory stipulated a ten-hour work system. However, under the leadership of the team leaders Liang Heyi and Wang Caixian (female), when the crushed flour could not meet the demand, they would automatically add voluntary labor without going through the section chief and foreman. The whole team put forward the rule that "the entire production task must never be delayed in our team." The output of the concentration team has increased from six to seven catties of oil per hundred catties of white oil to eight catties, and the quality is also more pure. In February, according to the existing conditions of the section, the factory director gave them the task of producing ×× catties of finished oil for the entire month based on twenty-eight working days. However, due to a breakdown in the engine and three days of repairs, the factory director reduced the task by one-tenth. But with the efforts of all the workers in the section, the result exceeded the first stipulated task by 2.6 percent.

The foreman continued: When the women workers built the factory, they carried soil, raised earth, and built walls like men, and quickly completed the task of building the factory and started production. Female workers in this factory do occupy an important position in production. They account for about a quarter of the people in each team, and they voluntarily engage in many heavier physical labor such as carrying water, carrying oil, transporting raw materials, and watching machines. Yang Xuemei, a female worker in the cleaning team, carries raw materials weighing about one hundred and fifty catties and pours them into the cleaning pool as tall as a person without any effort. She also sings "Down with the reactionaries, build a new China" happily while walking.

The foreman also told me: "Of the four teams in the section, three are female team leaders. They are familiar with the entire production process, and the work in the team is well-organized. Because they work ahead and eat behind, they motivate all the workers to actively produce. No one in the factory thinks of women as appendages of men anymore." Yes, they have a high degree of political consciousness under the long-term cultivation and education of the Communist Party, and they have a clear political concept: to sacrifice everything personal for the cause of people's liberation. Therefore, more than 60% of them have made meritorious services or major meritorious services on the production front.

Ma Baochai and Guo Xiunv are in the concentration team. When oil drops spilled, they would use cloth to wipe them up and wring them into the raw materials. They said, "Less waste of raw materials means more combat effectiveness." Liu Zhiyong, Zhang Yingwen, Wang Yuzhen, and others in the conversion team saw mud in the oil pool, fearing that it would affect the quality of the finished product, so they cleaned it barefoot regardless of the dirt. The factory stipulates three days of leave per month, but they are unwilling to rest and always insist on working. I once asked several female workers, "Why do women have such high enthusiasm for labor?" Yang Xuemei, the leader of the cleaning team, said to me: "In a war environment, women can only do this to spare more men to go to the front, and the war can end sooner." It made me deeply feel how great the contribution of female workers to the liberation war is! They have developed a high degree of work ability, and they are working tirelessly to liberate themselves and liberate mankind.

　　赶造甘油的女工们
    四月五日，记者访问了华北五十四厂甘油股。厂里全体工人，都以战斗姿态为研究技术、改进产品质量、支援前方战争而努力。甘油股的工务室里，一位年约三十的健康妇女司玉梅，正忙碌的登计考勤表册和原料数字。她从一九四五年加入工厂后，虚心的学会了许多技术，于年前提升为甘油股工长了。她满意的向我介绍了工人在生产中的许多创造，随后她又伴随着我参观了每一个生产过程。
    走入改造班，女工王玉珍正全力以赴的搅合着沸腾的油锅，掌握火候，时刻地注视着，怕油漫出，糟蹋了原料。
    “累不累？您能坚持吗？”我在试探着问她。
    “累！是累哟！打蒋介石反动派说的什么‘累’！全厂哪一个不累！？比起前方的战士还轻闲的多哩！”她慷慨的回答我。
    该班过去每锅只容纳七十斤白油，经过工人改装了改造锅后，产品比原来扩大了三倍。年前工人每班并由八个人减至七个人，一月份后又减至五人了，不仅同样的能完成任务，并创造了每班九分钟清除八锅半成品（每锅约五、六百斤）的工作效率。生产第二部——破碎班，厂内规定十小时工作制，但在正副班长梁和义、王彩贤（女）领导下，全班工人当破碎的面子供不上使用时，他们也不通过股长和工长就自动加义务工，全班提出了“整个生产任务，绝不能耽误在咱们班里”的规定。蒸浓班的产量由每百斤白油出油六至七斤，提高到八斤了，质量亦更加纯净。二月份厂长根据该股现有条件给她们的任务整个月按二十八个工作日，出成品油××斤，但因发动机发生了故障，修理了三天厂长给减少了十分之一的任务。但在全股工人的努力下，结果反超过了第一次规定的任务百分之二点六。
    工长接着说：女工们在建厂时，她们带着散工和泥、抬土、垒墙等，无异于男子，很快就完成了建厂的任务，开始了生产。该厂女工，在生产中确实占了重要的地位，各班约占四分之一的人数，她们自愿的从事挑水、挑油、抬原料、看机器等许多较重的体力劳动。清洗班女工杨雪梅抬着重约百五十斤的原料，倒在高与人齐的清洗池里，毫不吃力，她还非常愉快的边走边唱着“打倒反动派，建立新中国”的歌子。
    工长还告诉我：“全股四个班，已有三个班是女班长，她们熟悉了整个生产过程，班里的工作都是有条不紊。由于她们做活在头里，吃饭在后头，带动全体工人都在积极生产。工厂中再没有认为妇女是男子的附属品了。”是的，她们长期在共产党的培养教育之下，有了高度的政治觉悟，她们有明确的政治观念：为人民解放事业而牺牲个人的一切。因此，在生产战线上，有百分之六十以上立过功或大功。
    马宝钗、郭秀女是蒸浓的，当着洒了油滴时，她们都用布沾起来拧在原料里，她们说：“少糟蹋一点原料，就多增加一分战斗力。”改造班刘志勇、张英文、王玉珍等见到盛油池子里，有了泥根子，恐怕影响成品的质量，她们不顾脏，光着脚下去清理。厂内规定每月三天例假，她不肯休息，始终是坚持着工作。我曾问到几个女工：“妇女们为什么有这样高的劳动热情？”清洗班长杨雪梅对我说：“在战争环境里，妇女们只有这样，才能剩出更多的男子到前线去，战争才能早日结束。”使我深深感到女工对解放战争的供献，是如何的伟大！她们发挥了高度工作的能力，她们为解放自己，解放人类而不懈的工作着。
