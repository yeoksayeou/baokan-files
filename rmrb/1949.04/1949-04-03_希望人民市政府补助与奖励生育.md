　　Hoping the People's Government will Subsidize and Reward Childbirth
    In times of stable life, obstetricians are busy treating infertile patients every day. In recent years, due to the Kuomintang government's exploitation, everyone is impoverished, and hospitals are busy performing birth control surgeries every day. If this continues, what can we expect for the future of the nation? Under normal circumstances, if a couple is physiologically healthy, they can have two or three children within five or six years after marriage. However, living expenses will double as a result. Family work will also be heavier due to the children. Under duress, mothers have to give up work and return home to raise their children, making life difficult and their mental state very poor. On the other hand, people who are physiologically unhealthy and infertile are better off. This unreasonable phenomenon makes poor women regard childbirth as a daunting prospect. Last spring, someone called on the newspaper to "save the second generation," but the then reactionary government simply ignored it. During the Japanese occupation of Beiping, in order to increase their invading population, they had a system of rewarding childbirth for Japanese people: couples with two children would receive compulsory public education, and for each additional child, their work unit or the competent authority would pay a monthly education subsidy and incentive bonus. The amount would increase progressively. For those with more than six children, the incentive bonus would be further increased. We do not need to invade other countries, but in order to develop production, we also need to encourage childbirth. Recently, I read the book "Soviet Family, Marriage, and Motherhood." The Soviet Union's methods of rewarding childbirth and providing educational subsidies, and its care for mothers, are meticulous. No wonder the Soviet population is increasing. Considering the above, in my humble opinion, the newly liberated areas and cities should actively encourage childbirth and increase the population. The method is: the government should stipulate the number of children for compulsory public education; for those exceeding the compulsory number, the People's Government should entrust the competent authorities to add monthly education subsidies and incentive bonuses. So that families with more children can get considerable subsidies. This is the only way to fundamentally solve this problem.
    Now that Beiping has just been liberated, there are certainly many major issues to be addressed; but this issue should also be considered. It is hoped that the People's Government can discuss and stipulate some specific measures within the scope of its economic power.

　　希望人民市政府补助与奖励生育
    在生活安定的时期，产科医生天天忙于医治不育的患者；近年来因国民党政府搜刮，人人穷困，医院则天天忙于施行节育手术。长此以往，民族前途何堪设想？按一般情况，倘夫妻生理健全，结婚后五、六年定可生育子女二、三人。但生活费却要因此增加一倍。家庭工作也因孩子而加重。迫不得已，母性只好放弃工作，回到家中扶养子女，生活艰苦，精神也很坏。另一方面，生理不健全的人，不育子女，情况却比较好些。这种不合理现象，使穷女性视生育为畏途。去春曾有人在报上呼吁过“救救第二代”，但当时的反动政府是根本不理睬的。日寇侵占北平时期，他们为了增加侵略人口，对日人是有奖育办法的：生育子女二人的夫妇为人民义务教养，每多育一人，即由其服务机关或主管机关按月发给教养补助费及奖育金。其款额是递增的。满六人以上者，奖育金更要加多。我们不需要侵略他国，但为了发展生产，也是需要奖励生育的。最近我看苏联家庭婚姻母性一书，苏联的对奖育办法及教养补助办法，对母性的关照，更是无微不至，无怪苏联人口增加。综合以上，拙见新解放区与城市中应着手积极鼓励生育，增加人口。方法是：由政府规定人民义务教养子女人数；超过义务人数的，由人民政府委托主管机关另加按月的教养补助费及奖育金。使子女多者得到相当之补助。这样才能从根本上解决这一问题。
    今北平甫告解放，待处理的重大问题当然很多；但这个问题也应该在考虑之列。希望人民政府能在经济力量达到的范围内，讨论规定一些具体办法。
