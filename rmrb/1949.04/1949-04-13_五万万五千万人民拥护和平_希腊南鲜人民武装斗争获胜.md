　　The date of the World Peace Congress, watched by the entire globe, is approaching day by day. The number of people of all ethnicities, political persuasions, and religious beliefs who support the World Peace Congress is increasing daily. Various groups representing over 550 million people have already announced their willingness to participate in the congress. The preparatory committees of thirty countries are carrying out extensive activities. Two thousand delegates from countries around the world have already set out for Paris or are about to depart to attend the grand gathering. This is a grand gathering to review and mobilize the peace forces of the entire world. According to Zápotocký, the congress "will seriously strike the warmongers."

　　On one side, hundreds of millions of people are holding large-scale demonstrations to defend peace around the world; on the other side, a dozen people despised by the people are signing the North Atlantic Treaty in the Zhujiang [River, i.e. Western countries]. How strong is the force demanding peace? How strong is the force demanding war? Is this not clear enough? Although the ranks of the war-mongers are so lonely and fragile, in order to save their dying luck, they are still arrogantly continuing to prepare for war. This is manifested in the signing of the North Atlantic Treaty, the rejection of the Soviet government's memorandum of protest against the North Atlantic Treaty, the active formulation of the US government's so-called "foreign military aid plan," the announcement of the so-called "Western European Defense Plan" by the five countries of Britain, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg, the agreement between the US, British, and French governments to implement the so-called "Occupation Statute" in West Germany, and the brewing of the so-called "Pacific Regional Pact" as a "supplement to the North Atlantic Treaty," and so on. All of this, peace-loving people must still soberly see and seriously guard against, and resolutely expose and counter all open or secret activities of the warmongers. The powerful offensive launched by the Greek Democratic Army in the Grammos Mountains has ended after achieving a great victory in its first phase. In the two-day siege, nearly 4,000 royalist fascist troops have been annihilated. On other fronts, the Democratic Army currently holds the initiative. After the reorganization of the Greek Provisional Democratic Government, it announced the list of Greece's chief war criminals. The declaration of the Provisional Democratic Government pointed out that the crisis of the royalist fascists has reached its peak. The declaration calls on the Democratic Army to give the enemy a fierce blow and make 1949 a year of decisive victory.

　　In South Korea, as Jeju Island entered the first anniversary of the people's uprising, the armed struggle has expanded to eleven of the twelve administrative districts of Jeju Island and the island's only city. As of the end of February, the area of the South Korean guerrilla war has included 77 counties, 283 townships, and three cities. People's democratic power has been restored in eight counties, and land reform and other democratic measures have been implemented.

　　五万万五千万人民拥护和平
  　希腊南鲜人民武装斗争获胜
    全球注视的世界拥护和平大会的会期一天天地接近了。支持世界拥护和平大会的各个民族各种政治主张与宗教信仰的人们，一天天地在增加。代表五亿五千万人以上的各种团体，已经宣布愿意参加大会。三十个国家的筹备委员会，正在进行广泛的活动。世界各国的两千名代表，已经或即将启程赴巴黎出席盛会。这是一个检阅和动员全世界和平力量的盛会。据真理萨波托斯基说，大会“将严重地打击战争挑拨者”。
    一边是几万万人在世界各地举行保卫和平的大示威，另一边是被人民所唾骂的十几个人在朱江等签订北大西洋公约。要求和平的力量有多大？要求战争的力量有多大？这难道还不明白吗？战争贩子的队伍虽然是如此孤单和脆弱，可是，为了挽救他们垂死的幸运，他们还是在狂妄地继续准备战争。这表现在北大西洋公约的签字，苏联政府关于北大西洋公约的抗议备忘录的被拒绝，美国政府的所谓“对外军事援助计划”的积极拟订，英、法、比、荷、卢五国所谓“西欧联防计划”的宣布，美英法政府在西德实施所谓“占领法规”的协议，作为“北大西洋公约补充”的所谓“太平洋区域公约”的酝酿等等。所有这一切，爱好和平的人们依然要清醒地看到并加以严重地警惕，对于战争贩子一切公开的或秘密的活动，依然要坚决地加以揭露和反击。希腊民主军在格拉姆斯山区发动的强大攻势，其第一阶段已在获得大胜之后结束。在两天的围攻中，保皇法西斯军已被歼灭近四千名。在其他战线上，民主军目前都掌握着主动权。希腊临时民主政府改组后宣布了希腊首要战争罪犯的名单。临时民主政府的宣言指出：保皇法西斯的危机已达顶点。宣言号召民主军给敌人猛烈的打击，使一九四九年成为决定胜利的一年。
    在南朝鲜，当济州为人民起义进入一周年的时候，武装斗争已扩及到济州岛十二个行政区中的十一个以及该岛的唯一城市，截至二月底为止，南朝鲜游击战争的地区，已经包括七十七个县，二百八十三个乡和三座城市。人民民主政权已在八个县中恢复，土地改革及其他民主措施已经实行。
