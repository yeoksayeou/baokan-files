　　Levying Spring Business Tax
　　Ping City Achieves Preliminary Success

　　[Our Newspaper] The Ping City's spring business tax collection work for this year began on the 14th of this month. The Municipal Tax Bureau mobilized 70 cadres to cooperate with cadres drawn from various sub-bureaus to form four "Business Tax Work Teams," selecting districts under the First, Second, Third, and Fourth Sub-bureaus as key areas. In the past ten days, preliminary achievements and experiences have been obtained. According to incomplete statistics from key areas, 16,228 businesses have completed initial declaration procedures, and 2,000 have undergone evaluation. Among the business community, many correctly understand the tax policies of the People's Government and honestly declare their turnover. However, many businessmen have also falsified accounts and underreported income. Only through persuasion and education by the staff, or with the assistance of citizens, especially shop assistants, were they gradually corrected. For example, the Yu Mei Zhai Dim Sum Shop on XinJiekou South Street initially declared a total turnover for January, February, and March of: 9,548 yuan in bogus gold yuan and 5,163 yuan in People's currency. After education, the second declaration was revised to 331,430 yuan in bogus gold yuan and 20,492 yuan in People's currency. Furthermore, some businessmen, knowing that the People's Government is strict and serious in implementing policies, later voluntarily made supplementary declarations. The first phase of the business tax collection, the declaration work, has been arranged and will be generally evaluated by early May. The experience gained by the Beijing Tax Bureau and its sub-bureaus in this phase of work is: (1) Tax officials under the leadership of the People's Government are impartial and do not accept bribes, leaving no loopholes for bad businessmen to exploit. (2) Patient persuasion and education to explain tax policies. (3) In-depth investigation. (4) Assistance from district and street governments. (5) Progress is smooth in areas where workers and shop assistants are organized, or where the street government is well-established.

　　征收春季营业税
  　平市获得初步成绩
    【本报讯】平市本年度春季营业税征收工作于本月十四日开始。市税务局曾动员了七十个干部配合各分局抽出的干部组成四个“营业税工作队”，选择了一、二、三、四分局地区为重点区，十日来已获得初步成绩与经验。据重点区不完全统计，已有一万六千二百二十八户商号完成了初步申报手续，并有二千户经过了评议。在商人层中，正确认识了人民政府税收政策，老老实实申报流水额的固然不少，但也有很多商人伪造假帐少报收入。经过工作人员说服教育，或是市民特别是店员协助，才逐渐改正。新街口南大街毓美斋点心铺，第一次申报一、二、三月份流水额共计为：伪金圆券九千五百四十八元，人民券五千一百六十三元，经过教育后，第二次就改报为伪金圆券三十三万一千四百三十元，人民券二万零四百九十二元。另有些商人知道人民政府执行政策是严格认真的，后来又自动补报了。现征收营业税第一阶段申报工作已布置完，毕五月初即能普遍进行评议。北平税务局暨各分局在这一阶段工作中得到的经验是：（一）人民政府领导下的税务人员不循私不受贿，坏商人即无隙可乘。（二）耐心说服教育，解释税收政策。（三）深入的调查。（四）区街政府协助。（五）凡是工人和店员有组织，或是街政权健全的区域，工作进展即顺利。　　　　　　　　　　　（宇）
