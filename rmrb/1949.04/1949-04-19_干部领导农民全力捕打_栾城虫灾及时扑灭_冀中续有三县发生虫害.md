[Central Hebei News] Cadres Lead Farmers in All-Out Pest Control; Luan City Worm Infestation Promptly Eliminated; Worm Infestation Continues in Three Counties in Central Hebei.

[Central Hebei News] The worm infestation in all thirty-two villages of Luancheng County has been eliminated. Starting March 23rd, a "fire spider" worm infestation occurred successively in 21,163 mu of wheat fields in 32 villages of the second, third, fourth, and sixth districts of the county. On the most severely affected road from Suqiu Village in the third district to Youtong Village in the second district, many wheat leaves were eaten by worms and turned yellow. After the county party committee discovered this, it immediately organized cadres to lead the masses in pest control, and instructed: "In districts and villages where worms are found, district and village cadres must concentrate all their efforts to catch worms and resolutely eliminate the worm infestation." Upon hearing the news, the prefectural party committee dispatched three people from Xinji Farm and 50 students from the Party School overnight to the villages where the worm infestation occurred, in conjunction with county and district cadres, to vigorously mobilize and organize the masses to catch worms, and introduced pest control methods. When the worms first appeared, some farmers thought, "The appearance of worms is God's will, there is no way to deal with it," and others said, "Worms appear every year, it doesn't matter." After various propaganda and experiments, the masses paid attention to it. For example, after spraying "DDT powder" or "large leaf tobacco water" to kill the worms in Beichen Village in the sixth district, the masses believed in the effectiveness of using pesticides to kill worms, but because there were not many pesticides, the masses used cold water to water, sprinkle, and hoe the wheat. The wheat in Youtong Village in the second district was watered twice, the worms died, and the leaves turned green again. Cadres in Suqiu Village in the third district organized the masses and took the lead in going to the fields to water and hoe the wheat. More than 40 households of revolutionary martyrs' families and widowed and lonely farmers with no labor force were organized to push water carts and exchange labor. Seventy-one young and middle-aged women went to the fields to catch worms, and 800 mu of worms were eliminated in two days. The civil affairs director said: "Fighting worms is like fighting the Kuomintang reactionaries, if you don't kill them, you can't keep your rice bowl!" In many villages in the fourth district, only the elderly were left at home to cook, and the rest went to the fields to catch worms and water the wheat. After a week of intensive work, as of the 6th of this month, the worm infestation in all 32 villages has been eliminated. Because the pest control was timely, the loss of wheat was minimal, and the wheat fields were watered once. A total of 18,610 mu of land was watered in 32 villages. A total of 2,618 men and women participated in the worm catching (referring to full labor force, half labor force and children are not included), and 261 mutual aid teams were organized in the worm catching.

[Central Hebei Electricity] Following the occurrence of worm infestations in Ningjin, Luancheng and other counties, "fire spiders" have also been found in wheat seedlings in Anxin, Wuqiang, Lixian and other places recently. In eleven villages such as Nanbei Feng Village in the fourth district of Anxin, 150 hectares of wheat fields have suffered from severe fire spider disasters. The severely affected have already withered and died, while the lightly affected are also showing signs of dryness and yellowing. After this situation was discovered, the county party committee immediately dispatched county cadres to cooperate with all the cadres in the fourth district to go to the disaster villages to mobilize the masses to dig earth wells on a large scale, and planned to dig a water ditch from the Zhulong River to water the wheat in large quantities in order to effectively prevent and eliminate the disaster. Fire spiders have also occurred in the first, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, and eighth districts of Lixian County. The most serious is Dayangzhuang in the fourth district, where more than 300 mu of wheat fields have been infested with fire spiders. Dry leaves were found on the roots of wheat fields with fire spiders, the wheat seedlings turned light, and there were white spots. The severely affected have dried to the wheat tips, the wheat seedlings have turned white, withered and died. According to inspection and research, this fire spider has reproduced for three generations. A fire spider worm infestation has also occurred in the ninth district of Wuqiang. The Wuqiang and Lixian county governments instructed all districts to catch worms, and at the same time organized cadres to go to the countryside, and mobilized primary and high school students to carry out extensive publicity and introduce prevention and control methods such as more hoeing and watering of wheat. Prevention and control are currently underway.

　　干部领导农民全力捕打
  　栾城虫灾及时扑灭
  　冀中续有三县发生虫害
    【冀中讯】栾城三十二个村全部消灭虫灾。三月二十三号起，本县二、三、四、六三十二个村二万一千一百六十三亩麦田，相继发生了“火蛛子”虫害，最严重的三区苏邱村至二区油通村道上，麦叶很多被虫子吃得发黄了。县委发现后，马上组织干部领导群众捕打，并指示：“凡是发现虫子的区、村，区、村干部要集中一切力量捕虫，坚决消灭虫灾。”地委闻讯，星夜派出辛集农场三人、党校学员五十人，结合县、区干部分赴发生虫害村庄，大力发动组织群众捕虫，并介绍治虫办法。虫子刚一发生时，有的农民认为：“出虫子是天意，没有办法”，也有的说：“出虫的事那年也有，不要紧”，经过了各种宣传和试验，群众才注意起来。如在六区北陈村用“滴滴涕粉”或“大叶烟水”把虫子喷死后，群众相信了用药杀虫的效能，但因药品不多，群众即用冷水浇、泼、锄麦的办法，二区油通村的麦子浇了二次，虫子死了，叶子返了青。三区苏邱村干部，组织了群众并带头下地浇麦、锄麦，四十多户没劳力的烈军工属及孤寡农民，组织起来推水车兴换工；七十一个青壮年妇女下地捕虫，二天便扑灭了八百亩的虫子。民政主任说：“打虫和打国民党反动派一样，打不死它保不住饭碗子！”四区很多村都只把老年人留在家里做饭，其余都下地打虫和浇水去。经过一周突击，截至本月六日止，三十二个村的虫害全部消灭。因为捕打及时，麦子损失极轻微，而且把麦地都浇了一遍，计三十二个村，共浇地一万八千六百一十亩。此次参加打虫的男女共二千六百一十八名（指全劳动力，半劳动力和儿童未计在内），打虫中组织了互助组共二百六十一个。

    【冀中电】继宁晋、栾城等县发生虫害后，安新、武强、蠡县等地麦苗近来也发现火蛛子。安新四区南北冯村等十一个村，一百五十顷麦田发生严重的火蛛子灾害，重者已将枯死，轻者亦显干黄。此情况发觉后，县委立即派出县干部协同四区全体干部，到灾村发动群众普遍挖土井，计划从潴龙河挖道水沟，大量浇麦，以作有效防止和消除。蠡县一、三、四、五、六、八区也有火蛛子发生，最严重的四区大杨庄发生火蛛子的麦田达三百余亩。有火蛛子的麦田，根上发现干叶，麦苗发淡，并有白点，严重的已干到麦尖，麦苗变白色，枯干而死。根据检查研究，这种火蛛虫已繁殖三期。武强九区也发生火蛛子虫灾。武强、蠡县县政府指示各区捕打，一面组织干部下乡，同时动员各地初、高小学生展开广泛宣传，介绍多锄麦、浇麦等防治办法。现正积极防除中。
