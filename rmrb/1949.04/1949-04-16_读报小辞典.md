　　Stalin Prize—In 1939, the Soviet government established the Stalin Prize to celebrate Stalin's sixtieth birthday, stipulating that any individual or group with special contributions in science, technology, art, and literature could be awarded it. The first Stalin Prizes were awarded in 1941, with each recipient also receiving a diploma and a medal. The first-class prize medal was gold, the second-class silver, and the third-class bronze. Nominees for the Stalin Prize were proposed by Soviet scientific, educational, and social organizations, and reviewed by two committees: the Stalin Prize Review Committee for Science, Technology, and Invention, and the Stalin Prize Review Committee for Literature and Art. The number of Stalin Prize winners each year, and the grade of the prize awarded to each person, were ultimately decided by the Soviet government and announced by the Council of Ministers in a special decree. In the Soviet Union, hundreds of people win the Stalin Prize every year, which precisely demonstrates the great achievements and brilliant prospects of socialist countries in science and art.

    斯大林奖金——一九三九年苏联政府为了庆祝斯大林六十寿辰，设立了斯大林奖金，规定凡在科学、工艺、艺术与文学方面有特殊贡献的个人或团体都可以援予。第一次颁发斯大林奖金，是在一九四一年，每个获得奖金的人还领得文凭一份、勋章一枚，一等奖金之勋章系金质，二等者银质，三等者铜质。领受斯大林奖金的预选人，是由苏联的科学机关、教育机关与社会团体提出，由两个委员会负责审查。这两个委员会是：管理科学、工艺与发明方面的斯大林奖金审查委员会和管理文学与艺术方面的斯大林奖金审查委员会。每一年度的斯大林奖金当选者的人数，每个人获得奖金的等级，最后是由苏联政府决定，由部长会议以一种授奖的特别法令宣布。在苏联每年都有几百个荣获斯大林奖金的人，这正表示着社会主义国家科学、艺术的伟大成就与辉煌的前程。
