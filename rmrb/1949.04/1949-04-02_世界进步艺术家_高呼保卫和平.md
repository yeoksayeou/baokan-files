The struggle for peace is the struggle for progress, for creative and constructive work, and for democracy and the future of mankind. He said that we must use progressive art with persuasive power to counter the tricks of the reactionary forces, who promote misanthropic sentiments, slander mankind, depict the world as a wilderness, and portray humans as irrational, vicious beasts. In conclusion, Shostakovich strongly urged the audience to strengthen the friendship between progressive workers in the cultural field and to combine the voice of art with the brave calls of the people of the world to strive for peace and democracy.

  　高呼保卫和平
    【新华社北平三十一日电】塔斯社讯：纽约文化与科学界保卫世界和平大会的艺术组二十七日举行会议。参加艺术组会议的美国演员、作家和剧作家在千人以上。
    美国著名剧作家与德斯谴责反动分子对进步的和平运动所加的压制。他说：“美国正在花费亿万金元来与全世界的反动势力及法西斯主义相勾结”。
    苏联作曲家萧斯塔科维奇步上讲台时，全场热烈欢迎。萧斯塔科维奇说，我们必须高呼保卫和平。争取和平的斗争，就是争取进步，争取创造性与建设性的工作，争取民主与人类前途的斗争。他说，我们必须用具有感化作用的进步的艺术，来对抗反动势力的诡计，反动势力宣传厌世情绪，诽谤人类，将世界描绘成荒野，将人类描绘成无理性的穷凶极恶的禽兽。萧斯塔科维奇在结语中力劝听众加强文化界进步工作者之间的友谊，将艺术的声音与世界人民勇敢的呼声相结合，以争取和平及民主。
