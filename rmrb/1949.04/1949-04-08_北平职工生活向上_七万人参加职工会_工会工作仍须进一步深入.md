　　Beiping Workers' Living Standards Improve; 70,000 Participate in Trade Union
  　Trade Union Work Still Needs Further Deepening
    [Report from our newspaper] Reporter Chen Yongjin reports: The labor movement in Beiping after liberation has achieved preliminary results, but there are still some shortcomings in the work. Since the liberation of Beiping (three months outside the city, two months inside the city), trade union preparatory committees have been organized in all major enterprises and factories. There are no less than forty trade union preparatory committee units, with a participation of 70,000 workers. Some unreasonable phenomena in wages have been carefully considered and some have been adjusted or are being adjusted. Cooperatives have been established in all major factories, and there are now 32 cooperatives with 68,310 members. Since the establishment of the cooperatives, they have sold 2,245,294 catties of food grain, 57,947 catties of salt, and 23,730 catties of peanut oil to their members, in addition to other daily necessities, which has provided a considerable guarantee for the workers' lives, avoiding the exploitation of middlemen and the impact of price fluctuations. Workers are also particularly active in cultural activities. More than 8,000 workers are now participating in study groups, and 2,979 workers have been trained (not including those attending large classes). The workers have also organized 518 correspondence groups, published 80 blackboard newspapers, and 162 mimeographed newspapers. They have also organized 26 Yangko and singing teams, as well as 13 Peking opera and drama troupes. After the economic and cultural lives of the workers have been resolved, they engage in production with great enthusiasm. Before liberation, the Mentougou Coal Mine had 450 people producing 130 tons of coal per day. Now, 40-50 people produce 250 tons of coal. The work that the workers of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant planned to complete in 24 days is now completed in 17 days. The Telecommunications Bureau used to repair 100 telephones in three days, but now they repair 300 telephones in three days. These are all significant achievements that have been made in the workers' movement. However, there are still shortcomings in the Beiping workers' movement. Comrade Xiao Ming, director of the preparatory committee of the Municipal Federation of Trade Unions, reviewed the serious phenomenon of being divorced from the masses in the workers' movement in the past two months at a meeting of trade union preparatory committees of major enterprises on April 7. He pointed out that the reason why the masses have not been fully mobilized is that the work teams do not approach the masses and do not consult with the masses when something happens, but are only caught up in bureaucratic busyness every day, without focusing on solving the urgent needs of the workers. He said: "We cannot live with the workers and talk about our innermost thoughts, we are just busy, and the busier we are, the more we are divorced from the masses." Regarding overcoming this phenomenon of being divorced from the masses, he said: (1) The work team and the trade union preparatory committee should report to all employees on the work done during the preparation period and conduct a deep self-criticism. (2) Please invite employees and employee representatives to a meeting to discuss their opinions on the work team and the trade union preparatory committee. (3) In the future, work plans should be discussed by the masses before implementation. (4) Convene representatives of workers from various factories to see what problems have not been resolved. (5) Problems that are necessary and possible to solve should be resolved quickly. Finally, everyone should have a good discussion with the workers on how to establish a formal trade union and mobilize the masses to conduct democratic elections.

　　北平职工生活向上　七万人参加职工会
  　工会工作仍须进一步深入
    【本报讯】记者陈勇进报导：解放后的北平职工运动已获得初步成绩，但在工作中也还存在着某些缺点。自北平（城外三个月，城内两个月）解放后，各主要企业工厂职工都组织了职工筹备会，职工筹备会单位不下四十余个，职工参加人数达七万来人。在工资问题上存在的一些不合理现象，经慎重考虑后，有的已经调整，或正在调整中。所有大工厂都成立了合作社，现共有合作社三十二个，社员六万八千三百一十人。合作社成立以来售给社员食粮二百二十四万五千二百九十四斤，食盐五万七千九百四十七斤，花生油二万三千七百三十斤，此外尚有其他日用品，相当的保证了工人的生活，避免了中间商人的剥削及物价波动的影响。工人们在文化活动上亦特别活跃，职工现在参加学习小组的有八千余人，并训练了二千九百七十九个职工（上大课者不在其内）。职工们并组织了通讯小组五百一十八个，出黑板报壁报八十块，油印报一百六十二期。自己并组织了二十六个秧歌、歌咏队、平剧、话剧团十三个。职工们在经济生活及文化生活上得到解决后，则以极大热情来从事生产，门头沟煤矿解放前四百五十人每日出煤一百三十吨，现在四五十人出煤二百五十吨，石景山钢铁厂工人计划二十四天完成的工作现在十七日即完成了。电信局电话机修理上过去三日修理一百架，现在三日即修理三百架。这些都是在职工运动中已经获得的显著成绩。但北平职工运动中还存在着缺点的，市职工总会筹备会主任萧明同志，在四月七日召开的主要企业单位职工会筹备会上，检讨了两个月来的职工运动中存在的严重的脱离群众的现象，指出群众还没有完全发动起来的原因是由于工作组不接近群众，有事不和群众商量，只是每天陷于事务主义的忙乱当中，没有重点的来解决工人迫切需要。他说：“我们不能和工友生活在一起谈谈心里的话，只是忙，越忙越脱离群众。”关于克服这种脱离群众的现象，他说：（一）工作组和职工筹委会应向全体职工报告筹备期间所做的工作，并进行深刻的自我检讨。（二）请职工和职工代表开会讨论对工作组和职工筹委会的意见。（三）今后工作拟出计划要经过群众的讨论再执行。（四）召开各厂的职工代表，看还有那些问题没有解决。（五）必要与可能解决的问题很快的求得解决。最后，要大家应很好的和职工们商量如何建立正式职工会，并发动群众进行民主选举。
