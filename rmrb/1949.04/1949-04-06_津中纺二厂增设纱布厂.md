　　[Tianjin Electric] The North China People's Government has recently decided that Tianjin No. 2 State-owned Textile Factory will add a gauze factory and has formed a factory construction committee. It plans to add a yarn and cloth factory, each with 25,000 spindles and 500 looms, at the old site of the First Storage Depot of the 70th Factory of the United Logistics Ordnance Department (formerly the Lao Yiyuan Yarn Factory during the Japanese puppet regime). The first phase of the plan is to add 10,000 spindles and 300 looms. Construction has already begun and is expected to be completed in four months. Upon completion of this work, 1,000 unemployed workers from the No. 7 State-owned Textile Factory, which was destroyed in the liberation war, will be able to obtain work. The workers of Factory No. 7 were very excited upon hearing the news.
　　[Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin Electric] The six textile factories under the Tianjin Branch of the China Textile Corporation have increased their weekly operating hours from four day and night shifts to five day and night shifts, starting from April 1st. Before the liberation of Tianjin, due to the incompetent management of the Kuomintang reactionary government, each factory lacked raw materials and could only operate for three days a week. After the People's Government took over the company, it worked hard to improve business management, and as the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas became smoother and the supply of raw cotton increased, it became possible to increase working hours.
　　Also reported: The Tianjin Branch of the China Textile Corporation held a handover conference on April 2nd, concluding the inventory and transfer work.

    【天津电】华北人民政府顷决定天津中纺第二厂增设纱布厂，并组成建厂委员会，拟在原联勤兵工署第七十厂第一保管库旧址（日伪时为老义源纱厂）增建二万五千锭子及五百台织布机之纱、布厂各一。其第一期计划拟增添一万锭子，三百台织布机，现已开始动工，预计四个月可以完成。此项工作完成后，可使在解放战役中被毁的中纺七厂的失业职工一千人获得工作。七厂职工闻讯后，非常兴奋。
    【新华社天津电】中纺公司天津分公司所属六个纺织厂，自四月一日开始，每周开工时间由四个昼夜班增为五个昼夜班。津市解放前，由于国民党反动政府经营无力，各厂原料不足，每周只能开工三天。人民政府接管该公司后，即努力改善经营管理，加以城乡物资交流日畅，原棉供应日增，使增加工作时间成为可能。
    又讯：中纺公司天津分公司于四月二日举行交接大会，结束清点、移交工作。
