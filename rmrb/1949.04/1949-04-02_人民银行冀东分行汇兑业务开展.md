　　【Tangshan News】The Jidong Branch of the People's Bank of China has recently been expanding its remittance business. The remittance area is gradually expanding. In addition to normal remittances in Jidong, Pingjin (Beijing-Tianjin), and the Northeast, remittance relationships with other regions such as Zhangjiakou, Shijiazhuang, and Baoding will also be established in early next month. In order to protect the interests of fishermen in the Nanbu area, in addition to providing fishermen's loans through local offices to support their development, a remittance office has also been established in Nanbu to specifically handle remittances to and from various cities, so that fishery products can be sold to various places in a timely manner. The remittance area of this office is temporarily set as Tianjin, Tanggu, Dagu, Lutai, Luanxian, Changli, Leting, Zunhua, Fengrun, Tangshan, etc., and will be handled directly by the banks in these places. Nanbu is the place with the most abundant marine products along the Bohai coast of Jidong. According to last year's export volume of Mao shrimp alone, it reached more than 40 million catties, and there are also many other marine products.

　　人民银行冀东分行汇兑业务开展
    【唐山讯】中国人民银行冀东分行近来汇兑业务日益开展，汇兑地区渐次扩大，除冀东、平、津、东北的汇兑按正常进行外，其他地区如张家口、石家庄、保定等地，亦于下月初次第建立汇兑关系。该行为保护南堡地区的渔民利益起见，除由当地办事处举办渔民贷款，扶助其发展外，并在南堡成立汇兑所，专门办理与各城市间的往来汇兑，使渔产能及时推销至各地。该处汇兑地区，暂定为天津、塘沽、大沽、芦台、滦县、昌黎、乐亭、遵化、丰润、唐山等地，由各该地银行直接办理。按南堡是冀东渤海沿岸海产最盛的地方，仅据去年毛虾出口量即达四千多万斤，其他海产物也很多。
