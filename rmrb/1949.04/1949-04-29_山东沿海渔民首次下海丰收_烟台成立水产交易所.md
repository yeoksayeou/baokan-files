Xinhua News Agency, Beiping, April 28th: Shandong coastal fishermen have had a bumper harvest on their first fishing trip this year, and large quantities of fresh fish and shrimp are already on the market. Fishermen from Shidao City, Mo Ye, using thirty-six sampans, went to sea for the first time in mid-March and caught 175,200 jin of noodlefish in seven days, more than 125,000 jin more than the total amount of noodlefish caught on the entire island last year. In Rongcheng County, ninety sampans from Longxudao with more than 5,900 gill nets have been completely deployed at sea. In just the first five days of April, they caught approximately 50,000 jin of small shrimp, 25,000 jin of miscellaneous fish, and more than 10,000 pairs of large shrimp. Fishermen on the island plan to increase their catch of fish and shrimp by 20 to 25 percent this year compared to last year. Fishermen in Yantai, Shijiusuo, and southern Rizhao have also gone to sea successively. Fresh fish such as yellow croaker are now on the market. Thanks to loans from the People's Government, fishermen in Shijiusuo and other places have added many new boats and nets, and have generally repaired old boats and nets. Recently, the Yantai Municipal Government, in order to facilitate fair trade for fishermen, has established an aquatic products exchange and set up fish ponds for pickling, to prevent fish merchants from driving down fish prices when there is an abundance of fish, thus harming the interests of fishermen.

Also reported: More than 3,000 fishermen households and more than 1,400 fishing boats along the coast of the Liaodong Peninsula, with the help of 7.12 billion yuan in loans from the Andong branch of the Northeast Bank, have successively gone to sea to fish, planning to catch 21 million jin of fish and shrimp this year.

　　山东沿海渔民首次下海丰收
  　烟台成立水产交易所
    【新华社北平二十八日电】山东沿海渔民今年首次下海丰收，大批鲜鱼鲜虾已上市。石岛市、莫鎁、渔民以三十六只舢舨于三月中旬首次出海，七天中即捕面条鱼十七万五千二百斤，比去年全岛捕条鱼的总数还多十二万五千余斤。荣城县龙须岛九十只舢舨，五千九百余条挂网已完全下海，只在四月初的五天之中，即得小虾约五万斤，杂鱼二万五千斤，大虾万余对。该岛渔民计划今年要比去年增捕鱼虾百分之二十至二十五。烟台、石臼所、日照南部等地渔民亦已先后下海。现在黄花鱼等鲜鱼已经上市。由于得到人民政府的贷款帮助，石臼所等地的渔民增置了不少新船新网，并且普遍地修补了旧船旧网。最近烟台市政府为了便利渔民公平交易，特成立水产交易所，并设鱼池腌制，以防止鱼商鱼多时压低鱼价，损害渔民利益。
    又讯：辽东半岛沿海已有本余渔民三千余户渔民，一千四百余条鱼船，在东北银行安东分行贷款七十一亿二千万元的帮助下，已先后下海捕鱼，计划今年捕鱼虾二千一万万斤。
