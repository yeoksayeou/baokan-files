Four Poems
    Liu Yazi

    On March 25th, Chairman Mao arrived in Beiping from Shijiazhuang. I, following Li Xi, Shen Heng, Chen Shu, Huang Ren, Fu Ding, and Ma Yin, went to the airport to welcome him. Then, we inspected the troops; their formation was majestic, giving an impression of invincibility. That night, a banquet was held at the Summer Palace, and upon returning, I composed this poem.

    China now has its Lenin and Stalin,
    Ten thousand families rejoice as I sing my poem.
    The past of Washington should be forgotten,
    The heinous deeds of Hitler and Mussolini must be wiped away.
    The people's liberation begins from this moment,
    The way out for workers and peasants is now beyond doubt.
    Gazing at the magnificent military strength like a raging fire,
    It is the time for the East to be praised and the West to be resented.

    Twenty-three years, three handshakes,
    Hills moved and valleys changed to this day.
    The Pearl River and the Guangdong Sea were astonishing at our first meeting,
    The Ba County and Chongqing farewells were at a different time.
    At the Yan River fighting I shed tears,
    At the founding of the capital in Yanjing, you must not decline.
    Overthrowing three thousand years of history,
    Casting magnificent and splendid words ourselves.

    The bright lighthouse shines on the Soviet Union,
    The wandering souls at the bottom of the cauldron are the United States.
    Atomic bombs and financial power should cease their mischief,
    How can the ambitious Tito be considered virtuous?
    The Yangtze River has never been an insurmountable barrier,
    How could the perverse Yu have hoped for complete survival?
    The million-strong army marching south is good,
    Fuchai will be beheaded in the east of Ningbo.

    The former Qing Palace is now the White House,
    We talked and laughed elegantly, emptying the wine barrels.
    The objective environment was not accidental,
    Our views on heroes are indeed similar.
    We sneer at Li Mi, the puppet taking the stage,
    We despise Yang Xiong, who offered his writings to the court.
    You can inherit the mantle of Sun Yat-sen,
    When the Great Way prevails, all under heaven will be public property.

　　诗四首
    柳亚子
    三月二十五日毛主席自石家庄至北平，余从李锡老，沈衡老，陈叔老，黄任老，符定老，马寅老之后，至机场迎迓。旋检阅军队，阵容雄壮，有凛乎不可犯之概。是夜宴集颐和园，归而赋此。
    中国于今有列斯，万家欢忭我吟诗。
    华拿往事休怀念，希墨元凶要荡夷。
    民众翻身从此始，工农出路更无疑。
    伫看荼火军容盛，正是东征西怨时。
　
    二十三年三握手，陵移谷换到今兹。
    珠江粤海惊初见，巴县渝州别一时。
    延水鏖兵吾有泪，燕都定鼎汝休辞。
    推翻历史三千载，自铸雄奇瑰丽词。
　
    光明镫塔耀苏联，釜底游魂美利坚。
    原子金元休作祟，枭雄铁托岂能贤。
    长江自昔非天堑，逆豫何曾幸瓦全。
    百万大军南下好，夫差授首甬东天。
　
    昔日清宫今白宫，雍容谈笑酒樽空。
    客观环境原非偶，所见英雄信略同。
    傀儡登场嗤李密，文章投阁贱杨雄。
    中山衣钵君能继，大道之行天下公。
