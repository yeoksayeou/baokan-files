　　Peiping Municipality Industrial and Commercial Household Business Tax
  　Will be Levied Based on Operating Conditions
  　People's Government Announces Spring Tax Collection Measures
    [This Newspaper's Dispatch] The Peiping Municipal People's Government announced that business tax should be levied based on the actual operating conditions of industry and commerce at the time of collection. In the past, the collection agencies of the Kuomintang reactionary government in Peiping, after conducting a so-called "general survey" once in 1946, determined the tax amount based on the results of the survey, which was extremely unfair. Although the situation has changed a lot since then, the so-called "simplified" households and "declaration" households were still implemented based on this unfair foundation, and the burden varied even more widely, with many black merchants not paying taxes at all. With the spring collection about to begin, the Peiping Municipal People's Government has made reforms in the methods to achieve a reasonable burden. The following are the regulations for the spring business tax (special business tax is the same) collection measures for this year: 1. Abolish the so-called "simplified collection method" of the past. All companies and merchants, regardless of whether they previously paid taxes by the "simplified" or "declaration" method, and regardless of whether they have joined a guild, shall uniformly submit a business tax declaration form (obtained from the relevant tax sub-bureau) to the tax sub-bureau in charge before April 2nd of this year, accurately filling in the amount of business revenue (i.e., the total amount of goods sold in the ledger) or the amount of business income (i.e., the total amount of remuneration and commissions) for the spring season (January to March of the 38th year of the Republic), and wait for tax assessment and payment. No false reporting or delay is allowed. 2. When the tax sub-bureaus review the business tax declaration forms of each household, they may select or designate impartial merchants in the same industry or on the same street to participate in the review. If it is deemed untrue, the relevant tax sub-bureau shall send personnel to investigate and directly assess the tax, and notify the household to pay it, which must not be refused. 3. Each taxable business shall pay the tax at the designated location within five days from the date of receiving the payment notice from the tax sub-bureau in charge. Late payment will be penalized. 4. Businesses that fail to declare within the time limit shall be fined from 50 yuan to 5,000 yuan. 5. If the original business tax law and its implementation rules conflict with these measures, these measures shall prevail to achieve fairness and rationality in tax payment. Everyone has the obligation to report those who make false declarations and attempt to evade tax. (Yong Jin)

　　平市工商户营业税
  　将按经营情况征收
  　人民政府公布春季稽征办法
    【本报讯】平市人民政府公布营业税应根据征收时工商业之实际经营情况课税。过去平市国民党反动政府之征收机关从三十五年一度实行所谓“普查”后，即根据普查结果核定税额，极不公允。以后虽情况变迁很多，仍根据此不公允之基础实行所谓“简化”户与“申报”户，其负担轻重更形悬殊，有很多黑商号根本不纳税。目前春季征收即将开始，平市人民政府为求得负担合理，特加以方法上的改革。规定本年春季营业税（特种营业税同此）稽征办法：一、废除以往所谓“简化征收办法”，所有公司商号，不论以往是以“简化”或“申报”方法纳税，也不论已否参加公会，统一限于本年四月二日以前向该管税务分局将春季（三十八年一至三月份）营业收额（即流水帐卖货总数）或营业收益额（即报酬佣金总数）据时填写营业税申报表（向该管税务分局领用），听候核税照缴，不准虚报或拖延。二、各税务分局审核各户营业税申报表时，得遴选或指定同业或同一街衢之公正商人参与审核。如认为不实，即由各该管税务分局派员调查，迳行核定后通知照缴，不得违拒。三、应纳税各商号于接到该管税分局送达收款书之日起五日内指定地点缴纳，逾期处罚。四、各商号逾期申报者处以五十元以上五千元以下之罚金。五、原营业税法暨其施行细则与此办法抵触者，悉依此办法求得纳税之公平合理。对申报不实、希图逃避纳税者，人人有检举之义务。  （勇进）
