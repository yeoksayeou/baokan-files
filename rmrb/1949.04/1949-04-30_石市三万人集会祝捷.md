    [Shijiazhuang Electric] More than 30,000 people from all walks of life in Shijiazhuang held a victory celebration rally on the 27th to celebrate the liberation of Nanjing and Taiyuan. Mass groups and costumed Yangko dance teams flooded into the meeting place through various streets. Red flags fluttered on Zhongshan Road, and the crowds surged and gongs and drums shook the sky.

The railway bureau units formed a large Yangko team of more than 900 people, stretching half a street in a mighty formation. Comrade Wu Liren of the Municipal Party Committee and Deputy Mayor Zang Boping addressed the meeting, calling on the city's people to actively produce to welcome the Red May competition, support the front, thoroughly liberate all of China, and strive for the victorious completion of the upcoming city-wide general election.
