Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 5th. The propaganda instructions issued by the Editorial Committee of the Central Propaganda Department of the Kuomintang on March 31st most accurately depict the political face of Chiang Kai-shek and the entire Kuomintang reaction group today. The full text of the instruction is as follows: “To all party newspaper offices: Those who advocate surrender accuse our party of refusing to admit defeat. This argument contains serious errors and toxins and must be clearly analyzed. (1) We admit the shortcomings and mistakes in the three aspects of politics, military affairs, and economy, which led to today's failure. We must deeply reflect on this and make painful reforms. (2) We cannot admit that today's failure is the final failure of China's anti-communist struggle. China's anti-communist struggle is a part and link of the world's anti-communist struggle. The anti-aggression front of the world's democratic countries is being formed. If the Soviet Union's expansion policy does not stop, it will inevitably lead to a world war. If the Soviet Union fails in the war, even if the CCP can control all of China, it will still be in vain. Therefore, the CCP's victory today has no decisive significance in a world war; and our failure today is not decisive, let alone final. (3) We must continue to fight today to prevent the CCP from developing and the situation from deteriorating, and to save China, preventing it from becoming a battlefield again. As long as our struggle for national independence and people's freedom does not stop for a day, China will not perish for a day. If the CCP insists on destroying China, the result will only be to advance the world war, so that the China issue can be resolved in the overall solution of world issues. Therefore, our failure today is just a ripple in the process of the overall struggle between world democracy and totalitarianism. (4) Only if we willingly abandon ourselves, surrender to the CCP, and stop fighting for national independence and people's freedom will it be our final failure, that is, the complete demise of China. Editorial Committee, March 31st." Here, the Kuomintang reactionaries reverse black and white, calling themselves and their imperialist masters "democratic," "anti-aggression," "saving China from becoming a battlefield again," and "fighting for national independence and people's freedom," while slandering the Chinese people, the Chinese Communist Party, and the Soviet Union in various ways, which is not worth refuting. What is noteworthy is that the Kuomintang reaction group does not admit its final failure. Even after all of China has been liberated, they still want to "struggle" "non-stop for a day" in order to stage a comeback in the Third World War. What the Kuomintang reaction group is most afraid of is that many people within the Kuomintang have already admitted defeat and decided to stop the counter-revolutionary "struggle" and surrender to the Chinese people, because this will help the final failure and complete demise of the Chinese counter-revolutionary forces. People can learn two basic lessons from this: First, all those within the Kuomintang who are willing to break away from this incorrigible and extremely vicious counter-revolutionary group should bravely resist the will of Chiang Kai-shek's clique and move closer to the people. This is the truly beneficial path for the country and the people. Even if the reactionaries scold them as surrenderists, they should not be afraid. Second, the Chinese people, both today and after the liberation of all of China, must continue to wage a resolute and merciless struggle against the open and hidden enemies who insist on carrying out the counter-revolution to the end. It must be understood that the resistance of resolute counter-revolutionaries to the revolutionary people will become even more intense because they have been overthrown by the people, therefore, vigilance against such enemies must also be strengthened.

　　蒋介石死党准备卷土重来又一铁证
    【新华社北平五日电】国民党中央宣传部社论委员会三月卅一日发出的宣传指示，最确切地刻划了蒋介石和整个国民党反动集团今天的政治面目。该指示全文如下：“各党报社鉴：投降主义者责备本党不肯承认失败，此种论调含有严重之误谬与毒素，必须明白分析。（一）吾人承认政治、军事、经济三方面之缺点与错误，招致今日之失败。吾人必须深切反省，痛加改革。（二）吾人不能承认今日之失败为中国反共斗争之最后失败。中国之反共斗争为世界反共斗争之一部分，一环节，今日世界民主国家反侵略阵线正在结成，苏俄之扩张政策如不停止，必将促成世界大战。苏俄如在大战中失败，则中共纵能控制中国之全部，仍属徒劳。因此，中共今日之胜利在世界大战上并无决定的意义；而吾人今日之失败，亦不是决定的，更不是最后的。（三）吾人今日必须继续奋斗，以阻止中共发展及情势恶劣，挽救中国，不使其重作大战战场。吾人为国家独立人民自由之奋斗一日不停，则中国即一日不灭亡。中共必欲灭亡中国，其结果只有提早世界大战，使中国问题在世界问题之总解决中得到解决，因此，吾人今日之失败不过是世界民主与极权全面斗争过程中之一道波纹。（四）只有吾人自甘暴弃，向中共投降，而停止为国家独立、人民自由之奋斗，始为吾人最后之失败，亦即为中国之彻底灭亡。社委会三十一日。”国民党反动派在这里颠倒黑白，把自己和自己的帝国主义主人称为“民主”，“反侵略”，“挽救中国不使其重作大战战场”，“为国家独立人民自由”而“奋斗”，而对中国人民、中国共产党和苏联加以种种污蔑，是不值一驳的。值得注意的是国民党反动集团不承认自己的最后失败，甚至在中国之全部都已经解放以后，他们仍然要“一日不停”地“奋斗”，以待世界第三次大战中卷土重来。国民党反动集团所最恐慌的，就是国民党内已经有许多人承认失败，决定停止反革命的“奋斗”而向中国人民投降，因为这将帮助中国反革命势力的最后失败和彻底灭亡。人们由此可以得到两个基本的教训：第一、国民党中一切愿意脱离这个至死不悟的穷凶极恶的反革命集团的人们，应当勇敢地反抗蒋介石死党的意志而向人民靠拢，这是真正有利于国家和人民的道路，即被反动派骂为投降派，也不要害怕。第二、中国人民在今天，以及在全中国解放以后，必须继续向坚持反革命到底的公开的和隐蔽的敌人作坚决无情的斗争。必须知道，坚决反革命分子的对于革命人民反抗，将因其被人民推翻的缘故而更加紧张起来，因此对于这种敌人的警惕性也必须加强起来。
