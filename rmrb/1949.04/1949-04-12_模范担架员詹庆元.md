Model Stretcher-Bearer Zhan Qingyuan
    Li Yuan

    Around Malanyu in Zunhua, honest and good-natured young men who don't talk much are called "min haizi" (people's children). Zhan Qingyuan of Malanyu Second Village is one of them. He was originally a poor farmer who turned over during the vigorous land reform, and his awareness greatly improved along with his change in status.

    It was this "min haizi" who, in August of the year before last, in order to cooperate with the Northeast Army's autumn offensive, first responded to the call of the "re-examination" work team: "Young people with blood and awareness should take on the task of long-distance stretcher-bearing!" He was the first to sign up, and motivated other young people to quickly gather enough people for two stretchers. The whole village saw them off to assemble and depart in the county.

    On the road, just like the revolutionary soldiers, no matter how far they walked, even a 150-mile march, they would fill the landlord's water tank. It was also often seen that he would carry or shoulder the backpacks of four or five people to take care of others in the group. When they left the pass, the population was sparse and housing was difficult. Sometimes a company was assigned one room, and he always gave his place on the kang (heated brick bed) to others. Before leaving, he took the initiative to mend shoes or socks for people with awls, needles, and thread, doing so for as many as 26 pairs.

    "We are all liberated peasants, and the troops are ours. We should take care of the wounded carefully and not let them suffer." Before accepting the task, he often used these words to encourage others. When the task came, he used his hands to collect the wounded's stool and urine. He didn't use any of the three dou (a unit of dry measure) of corn he sold from home for travel expenses; instead, he bought things to comfort the wounded, saying, "We only eat it for a moment of fullness. If we give it to the wounded, their happiness will reduce their pessimism." This great class love moved others to tears, and they also took out money to buy things to comfort the wounded.

    In the urgent environment of battle, his spirit of loving the wounded and not fearing sacrifice was even more evident. In the Yixi battle, Jiming Mountain was more than ten li high. He carried the wounded down from the top of the mountain and safely placed them on the stretchers. In the Shishan Station battle, the stretcher team encountered 17 or 18 enemy planes frantically strafing during their advance, injuring three team members and sacrificing one. Some team members showed panic, but he ran to the front and shouted, "Our Zunhua stretcher team has already been in the newspapers! We must maintain our glorious reputation! The troops are not afraid of death in battle, for whom? We must persevere and not be afraid of death!" This boosted the morale of the team members.

    The battle at Shishan Station was fierce. At night, in order to keep up with the heroic actions of the troops, he proposed that as soon as they heard the wounded cry out, they should carry them down. During the most intense fighting, our troops and the enemy were in close combat, and our stretcher team also followed the troops to the front line. At the most intense moment of the battle, Zhan Qingyuan was too nervous and led the way in a platoon, carrying the wounded down as soon as he heard a cry.

    He was most able to take care of the fatigue and emotions of other team members. During the day march, he was always in the lead, and at night he took care of everything from behind. After being away from home for more than two months, some team members from the same village were homesick. He said, "Malanyu is an old liberated area, and we came after we turned over. The whole village sent us off with drums and gongs. If we desert and go back, how can we face the people in the village!? We must resolutely complete the task, and we will not go home until the task is completed!"

    After opening up Siping, the stretcher team entered the new area. Zhan Qingyuan did not forget to spread the awareness of the peasants in the old liberated area to the new area. He often told the story of the peasants in the old liberated area turning over when doing work for the common people, saying "Poor people all over the world are one family," just like a land reform work team going down to the countryside. At this time, they had been away from home for more than four months, exceeding the original deadline by more than a month. When the Northeast Army announced that they were invited to return, he raised his fist and shouted, "I will not go back until the entire Northeast is liberated!" A "wow" of complete response was heard from below. Six months passed, and the Northeast Field Army repeatedly asked the Zunhua stretcher team to go back to the pass for rest. The leaders personally hosted a banquet to see them off. At the commendation meeting for the 1,300 members, Zhan Qingyuan was selected as a model stretcher-bearer and awarded a certificate of merit by the Northeast Democratic Allied Army (i.e., the People's Liberation Army).

    During the six months of arduous experience, Zhan Qingyuan has become a glorious Communist Party member. After returning home, he constantly told the masses about what he had seen and heard in the Northeast, took responsibility for public security in the village, and worked even more actively. Last October, he heard that the New Democratic Youth League was a progressive organization, so he went to the comrades doing youth work and first told them about his experience and requested to join the League. After being approved, he was also elected as the organization committee member of the Malanyu Youth League. He was also elected as the Jidong District representative to the National Youth Congress at this Jidong Youth Congress.

　　模范担架员詹庆元
    李远
    遵化马兰峪一带，把不爱说话老实厚道的青年人称为“民孩子”，马兰峪二村的詹庆元就是其中的一个。他原是个穷苦的庄稼人，在轰轰烈烈的土地改革里翻了身，随着翻身也大大提高了觉悟。
    就是这个“民孩子”，前年八月为了配合东北大军的秋季攻势，首先响应了“复查”工作组的号召：“有血性有觉悟的青年，应该担负起远征担架的任务！”第一个报了名，并带动其他青年很快聚齐了两付担架的人数，在全村欢送下到县里集合出发了。
    路上和革命军人一样，不管走多远，就是一百五十里长行军，也要给房东把水缸挑满。也经常可以看到他一个人背着或挑着四五个人的背包，来照顾同团的别人。出了口，人烟稀少，房子困难，有时一个连分配一间房，他总是把炕让给别人。走时他带着锥子、针、线主动地给人补鞋或袜子就达二十六双之多。
    “我们都是翻身农民，部队是我们的，对伤员我们应当小心爱护，不要叫他们受罪”。没有接受任务之前，他经常用这样的话来鼓舞旁人。等任务到了，他用手给伤员接屎接尿，从家里走时卖的三斗玉米路费一个没用，全都买了东西慰劳伤员，他说：“我们吃了不过饱一会。给了伤员，他一欢喜，就减少了悲观。”这种伟大的阶级友爱感动别人落泪，也掏出钱来买东西慰问伤员。
    战斗的紧急环境里，更表现了他热爱伤员不怕牺牲的精神。义西战斗，鸡鸣山十多里高，他从山顶背下伤员，安全送上担架。石山站战斗，担架队前进途中，遇到大小十七、八架敌机疯狂扫射，三个队员受伤一个队员牺牲了。有的团员表现恐慌，但他跑到前面高呼：“我们遵化担架团已经上了报纸，我们要保持光荣的名誉！部队打仗不怕死，为了谁呀？我们要坚持下去，不能怕死！”振奋了队员们的情绪。
    石山站战斗是激烈的。黑夜，为了赶上部队的英勇行动，他提出只要听见伤员喊叫声，就要往下抬，战斗最激烈时，我们的部队和敌人混战在一起，我们的担架团也随部队进至最前线，在战斗最激烈的时候詹庆元太紧张了，在一个排中带头听见叫声就往下背伤员。
    他最能照顾别的团员的劳累和情绪，白天行军永远是他在前面带路，黑夜则在后面照顾一切。离开家两个多月的时候，同村团员有的想家，他说：“马兰峪是老解放区，我们是翻了身来的，是全村罗鼓喧天欢送出来的，我们开小差回去，有脸见村里人哪！？我们要坚决完成任务，不完成任务不回家！”
    打开四平以后，担架团进入新区，詹庆元不忘把老区的农民觉悟传播给新区。经常在给老百姓做活时讲老解放区农民翻身的故事，说“天下穷人是一家”，就象土改工作组下了乡。这时间他们离家已有四个多月，超过原定期限一个多月了，东北军队宣布请他们回去时，他举起拳头大声说：“不解放全东北我不回去！”只听底下哇的一声，完全响应了这一号召。六个月过去了，东北野战军再三请遵化担架团进关休息，首长们亲自摆宴欢送，一千三百名团员的评功大会上，选詹庆元为模范担架队员，荣获了东北民主联军（即人民解放军）的奖状。
    六个月的坚苦经历里，詹庆元已成了一个光荣的共产党员。回到家里，不断把在东北的见闻讲给群众听，在村里负起治安员责任，工作更是积极。去年十月，他听说新民主主义青年团是个进步组织，就找到作青年工作同志首先讲了他的经历，要求入团，被批准以后，又当选了马兰峪青年团的组织委员。此次在冀东青年代表大会上并当选为出席全国青年代表大会之冀东区代表。
