(Huaibei News) The Zhangyuan Railway Sub-bureau, more than a month after the liberation of the eastern section of the Ping-Sui Railway, still lacks a clear direction in its work. After a hasty review of so-called old employees, the majority were reinstated. Among them, some bad elements, with little work ability, were also given "original positions and original salaries." Certain redundant personnel were not reduced; bad elements who committed many evils and were deeply hated by the masses were not dealt with according to the law. Even the Kuomintang secret service organization called "Police Affairs Section" was treated as a business unit and kept intact, given original positions and original salaries, continuing to sabotage work and suppress workers. When workers raised these issues and asked the sub-bureau to deal with them, the sub-bureau did not investigate and study, but rejected them on the grounds of "insufficient evidence" and "incomplete procedures." Using the excuse of "fear of causing chaos" and "bad influence," they dragged the matter on without resolving it. After liberation, a group of outstanding workers newly promoted in tasks such as repairing railways and supporting the front lines were dismissed or demoted to deputy positions. Some workers who were unreasonably dismissed by the Kuomintang era (many of whom were activists during the first liberation of Zhangyuan) have not yet been reinstated, or have not yet been given salaries after reinstatement. Workers angrily called their office a "KMT-CPC cooperation" agency. Some brave workers stood up to report bad elements. The Nankou administration adopted an attitude of "turning big problems into small problems, and small problems into no problems," which has been brewing discontent among the workers. On February 1st, after Lin Zian, the Director of the Zhangyuan Railway Sub-bureau, received a notice from the North China Ministry of Communications to attend a meeting in Fengtai, he issued a special order to prepare a special train for him: a first-class carriage for himself, the law enforcement team, guards, and more than ten staff members, and another carriage carrying his small sleeping car; and in advance, he telegraphed to the staff along the line to await Director Lin's arrival to give instructions and "report on work." The "report on work" was a euphemism, mainly to show off his power and to have the staff along the way greet him. After receiving the order, the Nankou staff immediately became busy, cleaning the platform and station, tidying up the interior. When the special train arrived, all the staff lined up on the platform to welcome him, waiting for instructions. At that time, Director Lin happened to have a cold, and a certain cadre accompanying him gave a few words of instruction on his behalf. The staff, who were already very dissatisfied, became even more disgusted by this scene, saying one after another: "Chairman Mao doesn't have such a big air." "Kuomintang directors took special trains, and the People's Liberation Army is also doing the same." The bureaucracy of the railway sub-bureau has reached an alarming level. Not long ago, the Chahar Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party raised a complaint about this matter and criticized Comrade Lin Zian. But until now, Lin Zian still lacks the spirit of self-criticism, believing that the facts are facts, but they cannot be interpreted badly. If it is interpreted as bureaucracy, it is attacking him. It is said that the Chahar Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, in order to educate Comrade Lin Zian and oppose bureaucracy, is still preparing to continue to carry out the struggle.

### 张垣铁路分局严重右倾  压抑工人留用坏分子　局长蔺子安应予撤职

　　张垣铁路分局严重右倾
    压抑工人留用坏分子
  　局长蔺子安应予撤职
    【华北讯】张垣铁路分局，在平绥路东段解放一个多月之后，工作上仍无明确方针，对所谓旧职员，经过草率审查，即大部恢复工作，其中有一部分坏分子，并无多大工作能力，也是“原职原薪”，对某些冗员不加裁汰；对坏分子作恶多端群众十分痛恨者，亦不依法处办，甚至把国民党特务组织叫做“警务课”的，也当成企业机构，而原封不动加以保持，且给以原职原薪，继续破坏工作，压抑工人。工人们提出这些问题，请求分局加以处理时，而分局并未调查研究，即以“证据不够”，“手续不周”予以拒绝，并用“怕搞乱了”，“影响不好”为借口，将此事一直拖下去，不给解决。解放后在抢修铁路，支援前线等工作中，新提拔的一批优秀工人则被撤消下去，或降为副职。被国民党时代无理开除的工人（不少是第一次解放张垣时的积极分子），有些直到现在还没有复工，或是复工后还没有定薪水。工人们气愤地把他们的办事处，叫做“国共合作”机关。有些勇敢的工人挺身出来，检举坏分子。南口行政上则采“大事化小，小事化无”的态度，致工人中一直酝酿着不满情绪。二月一日张垣铁路分局局长蔺子安，接到华北交通部到丰台开会的通知后，他特别下了一道命令为他准备专车：一节头等车，坐着他本人、执法队、警卫员及科员等十余人，另一节车皮载着他的小卧车；并且在事先即电令沿路各站职工人员听候在蔺局长到站时训话与“汇报工作”。“汇报工作”是饰词，主要是想摆摆威风，要让沿路员工迎接他。南口职工接到命令后，立即忙碌起来，打扫月台车站，整理内务，专车到来时，全体职工在月台上列队欢迎，等候训话。当时适逢蔺局长有些感冒，由随从的某干部代训了几句。本来就十分不满的职工、经此情景更为反感、纷纷说：“毛主席也没这大架子”。“国民党局长出来坐专车，解放军也闹这一套”，该铁路分局的官僚主义已达到惊人程度，不久以前，中共察哈尔省委，对此事提出检举，给蔺子安同志以批评，但直到现在，蔺子安仍缺乏自我批评精神，认为事实倒是事实，但不能做坏的解释，如果做成官僚主义的解释，就是打击他。据说中共察哈尔省委为了教育蔺子安同志及反对官僚主义起见，仍准备继续开展斗争。
