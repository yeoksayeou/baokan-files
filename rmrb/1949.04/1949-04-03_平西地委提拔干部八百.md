　　The Pingxi Prefectural Committee Promotes 800 Cadres
　　[Chahar News] In order to adapt to the development of the revolutionary situation, the Pingxi Prefectural Committee and its subordinate counties have achieved great results in the work of promoting, training, and transferring cadres in the three months since the joint meeting of the organization department committees last December. According to the original plan, 800 cadres were to be promoted in seven counties in three months, but 853 cadres were promoted in only five counties. A total of 561 cadres were transferred out of the area. The cadres transferred out generally have full enthusiasm. There are now cadres and 67 deputy positions have been filled. In terms of promotion methods, the main approach was to adopt the form of mobilizing from various training classes. In total, the counties trained 1,352 rural cadres and intellectual youth from the new areas, from which 586 cadres were promoted; 267 were individually mobilized in the villages or in support of the front lines and party rectification work. In the promotion of cadres, special attention was paid to the promotion of women cadres. For example, among the 853 newly promoted cadres, there were 162 women cadres. However, in the promotion process, individual counties, due to the urgency of the task, have produced the phenomenon of "filling the ranks with inferior personnel," resulting in the inability of the promoted cadres to work. This is something that should be paid special attention to in the future.

　　平西地委提拔干部八百
    【察哈尔讯】为了适应革命形势的发展，平西地委及所属各县，自去年十二月组织部委联席会议后，三个月来，在提拔培养与输送干部工作上收到了很大成绩。按原计划在七个县三个月中提拔干部八百名，但仅五个县即提拔了八百五十三名。输送出区干部共五百六十一名。调出干部一般情绪均极饱满。现有干部并配备了六十七个副职。在提拔的方法上，主要采取了开办各种训练班从中动员的形式。总计各县共训练了一千三百五十二个农村干部及新区知识分子，共提拔出干部五百八十六人；在村里或支援前线、整党工作中个别动员了二百六十七名。在提拔干部中，特别注意了提拔妇女干部，如新提拔出的八百五十三名干部中，就有一百六十二名妇女干部。但在提拔中，个别县份由于任务紧迫而产生了“滥竽充数”的现象，致使干部提拔出来后，不能工作。这是今后应该特别注意的。
