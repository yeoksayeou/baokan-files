　　Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, April 18th: Reports from various sources indicate that the French reactionary government is persisting in restricting representatives from various countries from attending the World Congress of Supporters of Peace in Paris. The Soviet delegation originally planned to consist of 52 people, plus a number of translators and secretaries, but the French government only agreed to issue visas to eight people. Subsequently, the Soviet Union voluntarily reduced the delegation to 48 representatives, plus eight translators and secretaries. As of the 17th, the French government had only issued twelve visas. Six members of the Soviet delegation, including Alexander Fadeyev and Wasilewska, have arrived in Paris to participate in the preparations for the congress. Another writer, Ilya Ehrenburg, and Archbishop Nikolai, representing the Orthodox Church, are scheduled to travel to Paris on the 18th.

　　The Czechoslovak Writers' Union protested to the French Embassy in Prague against the French government's limit of only eight visas for the Czech delegation attending the congress. The Czech Writers' Union strongly protested against France's refusal to grant an entry visa to the Chairman of the Writers' Union, Derda.

　　Romania's "Scanteia" reported: As of the 17th, although the meeting was only three days away, the French Embassy in Romania had not yet issued entry visas to the delegation. The broad masses of the Romanian people express deep indignation at this obstructionist action by the French reactionary government.

  　继续阻挠和平代表各国人民均表愤慨
    【新华社北平十八日电】各方报道：法国反动政府仍在坚持限制各国代表前往巴黎出席世界拥护和平大会。苏联代表团原来决定共为五十二人，另译员秘书若干人，但法政府只答应发给八人的护照签证。随后苏联已自动将代表减为四十八人，另译员秘书八人。至十七日，法政府还只发给十二张签证。苏联代表团中的亚历山大、法捷耶夫及华西尼夫斯卡等六人已抵达巴黎，参加大会筹备工作。另名作家爱伦堡和代表正教的大主教尼古拉定于十八日前往巴黎。
    捷克斯洛伐克作家联盟向布拉格法国大使馆抗议法政府仅给予捷出席大会代表团以八名限额的签证。捷作家联盟严重抗议法国拒绝给予作家联盟主席得尔达以入境签证。
    罗马尼亚的“斯堪提亚报”称：到十七日为止，虽然距会期只有三天了，但法国驻罗公使馆仍未发给代表团入境护照签证。罗国广大人民对法国反动政府这种阻挠行动，深表愤慨。
