Several Problems in Mutual Aid in the Semi-Old Liberated Area of Xingtai
　　I. The masses demand mutual aid, but oppose formalistic leadership.
　　If you casually ask a district or village cadre how the winter production went last year, the general answer is: "The masses have high morale and great achievements, but they just can't be organized." An old soldier's family member in Xishawo Village, Fourth District, said: "The Communist Party leads everything well, but I just don't like mutual aid groups..." Many people have opinions, dislike, and even consider it a burden to our leadership of mutual aid. However, checking from the actual activities of the masses, the masses do need mutual aid. Last winter's production was mostly done jointly. For example, the transportation teams in the Fifth District, with as few as six or seven animals and as many as twenty or thirty, transported goods together. The "zhang baozi" (i.e., the transportation team leader) was responsible for receiving and delivering the goods, and some teams even had doctors. Cadres in the First District reported that the masses were doing many things through mutual aid (watering, delivering manure, plowing, digging reed ditches, and digging lotus roots were all done in groups), but as soon as we led or convened a meeting, there was no mutual aid. Some people pretended to participate in mutual aid to support the cadres, while others participated in mutual aid secretly to avoid the hassle of meetings.

　　II. The main shortcomings of past leadership in mutual aid
　　① Cadres used administrative orders and formalistic work styles, pursued advanced forms, and mechanically applied the experiences of the old liberated areas. During the rush of wheat harvesting, autumn harvesting, and sowing, they forced the organization of large-scale village-wide mutual aid, leaving many problems unresolved. In order to pursue formal consolidation, serious unwillingness occurred. Other emphases on calculating points, setting work quotas, and rigidly separating work from pay confused the masses, who were not used to it.
　　② Production mutual aid formed administrative organizations that were responsible for tasks such as dispatching corvée labor, arranging meals, requisitioning public grain, substituting for others in farming, and collecting statistics. ... The masses found it troublesome and were unwilling to participate in mutual aid, let alone be the group leader.
　　③ One-sided emphasis on taking care of the widowed, orphaned, and poor led to resentment from those with labor power, who felt they were losing out, while those without labor power were also dissatisfied.
　　④ Due to the leadership's pursuit of advanced forms and large-scale mutual aid, the organization was complex, cadres were unable to lead, work was delayed, planned work and planned labor were not well-planned, and accounting meetings often lasted until midnight, leaving the masses exhausted.

　　The existence of these errors and shortcomings has caused the masses to develop a sense of dislike and even fear of mutual aid. The influence of this bad style hinders the development of a truly voluntary and equal-value mutual aid movement, which is a major problem in promoting the great production movement this year.

　　III. Several suggestions for future leadership of mutual aid:

　　First of all, it is still necessary to grasp the principles of voluntary, equal value, and democratic mutual aid, and to overcome the formalistic work style of emphasizing "advanced" and "large-scale" which does not conform to the production habits of small producers. As long as it is a truly voluntary combination that can improve labor efficiency and is willingly participated in by the masses, it is the correct mutual aid. On the issue of equal value, as long as the masses believe that neither party is losing out and both parties have no objection, whether it is exchanging labor for labor or recording work based on the task, the opinions and habits of the masses should be respected. On the existing basis, the masses should be educated and guided to understand the benefits of collective production and gradually move towards organization.

　　Secondly, the experiences and lessons of mutual aid in the old liberated areas should be summarized to break the cadre's tendency towards empiricism. It should be repeatedly explained that production mutual aid is the masses' own business, and cadres cannot force or replace them; however, leadership cannot be abandoned, and one cannot be indifferent. The responsibility of leaders is to help the masses solve problems, research methods, summarize experiences, and persuade and educate the masses to recognize the benefits of mutual aid production. Any hasty or coercive approach is unacceptable.

　　In addition, leading cadres should clearly understand that production mutual aid is mainly to organize individual farmers to engage in collective production, and it is not an organization to complete any administrative tasks. Any practice of using mutual aid groups to carry out other work or activities is wrong. The practice of forcing mutual aid groups to allocate "care" to the old, weak, orphaned, and widowed is even more wrong. The main thing is to educate these people to participate in production, or to organize sideline agricultural and handicraft work through labor exchange with mutual consent. A one-sided approach of giving charity cannot last. As for some orphaned, widowed, and elderly people who have no production capacity, they should be assisted and resolved administratively, and their living difficulties should not be solved through production mutual aid.

　　With spring plowing approaching and a general lack of labor force in various places, how to organize or rectify mutual aid to overcome labor difficulties and improve production efficiency is an urgent issue for production leaders in various places to pay attention to.

### 邢台半老区互助中的几个问题

　　邢台半老区互助中的几个问题
  　一、群众要求互助，但反对形式主义的领导。
    随便向一个区村干部问去年冬季生产搞得怎样？一般回答是：“群众情绪高，成绩大，就是组织不起来。”四区西沙窝村一个军属老头说：“共产党领导什么也好，我就是相不中互助组。……”许多群众对我们领导互助有意见，讨厌，甚至认为是负担。但从群众实际活动中检查，群众又是需要互助的。去冬生产大都是合伙干的。如五区的运输队，牲口少者六七头，多者二三十头，合伙运输。掌包子的（即运输队长）负揽货交货的责任，有些队并有医生。一区干部反映，群众许多活都是互助干（泼水、送粪、犁地、打苇沟、刨藕都是结伙干），我们一领导，一召集会就没互助了。群众对我们有的明互助暗不互助：为的支应干部；有的明不互助暗互助：为怕开会麻烦。
    二、过去领导互助的主要缺点
    ①干部的行政命令，形式主义作风，追求高级形式，死搬老区的经验，在麦收秋收突击下种中，强组全村大互助，遗留了许多问题弄不清。为了追求形式的巩固，发生了严重的不自愿现象。其他强调计分定晌、死分活用等，群众不习惯弄不清。
    ②生产互助形成行政组织，派差、派饭、要公粮、代耕、统计等，都要互助组来干。……群众嫌麻烦。不愿参加互助，更不愿当组长。
    ③片面强调照顾孤寡和贫困，有劳力的嫌吃亏，没劳力的也不满。
    ④由于领导上追求高级形式，要求大互助，组织复杂，干部不会领导，移地误工，计划活计划劳力不周，算帐开会一弄半夜，群众疲乏不堪。
    由于这些错误和缺点的存在，使群众对互助产生了讨厌甚至惧怕的思想。这种坏作风的影响，障碍了真正自愿等价的互助运动的开展，这是今年推动大生产运动的一个重大问题。
    三、对今后互助领导的几点意见：
    首先还是要掌握自愿等价民主的互助原则，克服强调“高级”、“大型”不合小生产者生产习惯的形式主义作风，只要是真正自愿结合能提高劳动效率为群众所乐于参加的都是正确的互助。在等价上，只要群众认为两不吃亏、双方没意见，工换工也好，按活记工也好，应尊重群众的意见和习惯，在现有基础上教育引导群众体会集体生产的好处，逐渐走向组织起来。
    其次，总结老区互助的经验教训，打破干部经验主义的思想，反复说明生产互助是群众自己的事，干部不能强制代替；但亦不能放弃领导，不闻不问。领导者的责任是帮助群众解决问题研究办法，总结经验，说服教育群众，使他们认识互助生产的利益，任何急性强制的作法都是要不得的。
    另外，领导干部应明确生产互助主要是组织个体农民进行集体生产，并不是完成什么行政任务的组织，一切利用互助组来进行其他工作或活动的作法都是不对的。对老弱孤寡硬给互助组分配强迫“照顾”的作法更是错误；对这些人主要是教育他们参加生产，或组织农副业针线活变工，在双方自愿下来互助，片面恩赐的作法决不能持久，至于有些毫无生产能力的孤寡老小，应从行政方面救济解决，不应以生产互助来解决他们的生活困难。
    春耕在即，各地劳动力又普遍缺乏，如何组织或整顿互助克服劳力困难，提高生产效能是各地生产领导者亟需注意的。
