　　Workers Became Masters of the Factory
  　A Visit to Jinhua Textile Factory

    "Everything has changed!"
    The famous Yuci Jinhua Textile Factory in Shanxi, after being liberated from the bureaucratic capitalist and bandit Yan Xishan last year, has now become a state-owned factory of the New Democracy. The workers have become the masters of the factory and are actively working hard to produce and demonstrate their creativity.
    Hu Peiyuan, a technician in the engine room – Old Hu's son, is tall with round, piercing eyes, revealing his tenacity. He said to me with such a firm tone: "In the reactionary factory in the past, we wouldn't repair many of the important parts on the machines! After liberation, we became the masters of the people's factory, and now we can repair what we couldn't repair before. When the Yan bandits retreated, they dismantled many important parts of the 500-horsepower engine, such as the metal mesh, front and rear endplates, and large tie rods… They thought that by dismantling these important parts, the Communist Party's People's Liberation Army would have no way to repair them when they came. However, after the Communist Party's People's Liberation Army arrived, we became the masters of the factory, and everyone was very motivated. Comrade Wang Jingzhai drew the designs and made the molds, and the sand casting workshop cast the machine parts. Originally, it was estimated that a dozen people would take ten days to repair this 500-horsepower engine, but as a result, a dozen of us completed it in less than six days."
    In the past, many parts of the factory's more than 42,000 fine yarn spindles and the associated openers, scutchers, mixers, and looms were broken. Now, they and the power department plan: in addition to the original lathes, they will add four more universal lathes, one large drill, and one press to ensure that the 17,000 to 18,000 spindles dismantled by the Yan bandits are brought back and to ensure that any parts that break can be made and replaced at any time. Worker Wang Jingzhai, who is responsible for the designs and models, said with confidence: "Don't just talk about these designs and models, I guarantee they can be made well; I can even create designs and models for the most complex water wheel on the water pump!" Later, when they introduced the British-made large drill press and the large drill press made by the workers themselves after liberation, the workers started both drill presses. The speed and efficiency of the drill press made by the workers themselves were no less than that of the British product.
    Not only are the workers in the power department working so actively and planning to expand the construction of the factory, but the workers in the spinning department are no exception.
    The female workers of the third shift in the spinning department, when they started resuming work last year, were considered technically inferior. Therefore, the saying "The first and second shifts are good, the third shift is bad" circulated in the spinning department at that time. The female workers of the third shift said angrily: "Others are people, and we are people too, why should we be labeled the 'bad third shift'?" Everyone unanimously and voluntarily supervised each other, worked hard to improve their skills, and were determined to catch up with the first and second shifts and change the reputation of this "bad third shift." During working hours, they often advised each other: "We can't doze off and ruin the reputation of our third shift. Now we are working in our own factory, and we can't be content to lag behind the first and second shifts. After working eight hours a day, we can still sleep well during the day." During the Chinese New Year, according to Liu Yongsheng, the leader of the trade union, "The third shift has caught up with the first and second shifts, and now the production results of the third shift are quite good!"
    In the past, under the cruel conditions imposed by the Japanese invaders and the Yan bandits, who forced the workers to "tighten their belts" and work for them, the workers were so hungry that they could not survive, and there was a serious trend of stealing things. At that time, this was the workers' resistance to the factory owners. After liberation, in the first month or two after the resumption of work, two bobbins were lost once, but immediately self-education was carried out among all the workers: "In our own factory, the supply of livelihood is guaranteed, and we should not use the past attitude of dealing with the factory's high exploitation to deal with our own factory. We must use democratic discipline to guarantee it! We cannot allow one person to steal and ruin everyone's reputation." Since then, there have been no more incidents of theft. And the person who stole also understood this principle and was determined to change.
    The spinning workers planned to install 10,000 fine yarn spindles in two months from December 13th last year to February this year. Due to the new labor attitude established by the workers, they broke the record of more than sixty workers installing one spinning machine during the Yan bandit's rule in the past, and created a new record of an average of eighteen workers installing one spinning machine. As a result, the entire plan was completed thirty-three days ahead of schedule on January 9th. They plan that this factory can not only restore to more than 42,000 spindles before the War of Resistance Against Japan, but also expand to more than 50,000 spindles!

　　工人做了工厂的主人
  　访问晋华纺织厂
    荣一农
    “一切都变了!”
    山西著名的榆次晋华纺织厂，去年由官僚资本家阎匪锡山手里解放以来，现已成为新民主主义的国营工厂，工人已作了工厂的主人，都在积极的努力生产和发挥自己的创造。
    引擎间技术工人胡培元——老胡的儿子，他身材高大，圆溜溜的眼睛里，表露着顽强，他是以那样坚定的口气对我说：“过去在反动工厂里，许多机器上的重要机件，我们是不替它修造的！解放以后，我们成了人民工厂的主人，过去不能修造的，现在都能修造了。五百匹马力的大引擎，阎匪在撤退时，把五金网、前后盘梗、大拉竿……许多重要机件都拆走，它们以为把这些重要机件拆走，共产党解放军来了，就没法修复。可是，共产党解放军来了后，我们成了工厂的主人，大家的劲儿很大，工友王静斋画图制模样，翻沙间翻成机器零件，原来预计十几个人用十天工夫，把这五百匹马力的大引擎修理好，结果我们十几个工人在六天以内就完成了。”
    过去这个工厂四万二千多细纱绽子和配属的和花机、松棉机、调棉机以及织布机等，很多零件坏了。现在他们和原动科计划：除了原来的床子以外，还要再添造四部元车床、一部大钻、一部压力机，保证把阎匪拆走的一万七八千绽子搬回来，保证随时坏了零件，随时都能造好补上。图样模型工人王静斋很有信心的说：“不要说这些图样模型，保证能作好；就是水泵上最复杂的翻水轮，我都能作成图样制成模型！”后来，当他们介绍到英国出品的大钻床和工人自己在解放以后制造出来的大钻床时，工人把两种钻床开动起来，工人自己造出的钻床不论转速和效用都不亚于英国的出品。
    不仅是原动部的工人如此积极工作和计划扩大建设工厂，就是纺织间的工人也没有例外。
    纺纱间第三班女工，在去年开始复工时，因为她们的技术较差，所以当时在纺纱间流传着：“头班二班烂三班”。而第三班的女工们气愤的说：“人家也是人，咱也是人，为什么咱们落个烂三班？”大家一致自动的互相监督，努力提高技术积极工作，决心一定要赶上头班二班，转变这种“烂三班”的名誉。在工作时间里，她们常互相劝告：“可不能打瞌睡，把咱三班的名誉弄坏了，现在是在自己工厂里工作，咱们不能甘心落在头班二班的后头，一天八点钟的工，作完了回去，白天一样能睡。“过年的时候，据工会领导人刘永生告我说：“三班已经赶上了头班二班，现在三班的生产成绩都不错！”
    过去这个工厂在日寇和阎匪残忍的叫工人“束紧腰带”，为它们作工之下，饿的工人没法生活，曾经存在着严重的偷东西的风气，在当时，这是工人们对厂主的反抗。解放后，在复工以后一两个月内，也曾有一次丢了两个穗子，但马上在全体工人中便进行着自我教育：“在自己的工厂里，生活供给有了保证，不应用过去对付厂方高度剥削的态度来对付自己的工厂，我们要用民主的纪律来保证！不能因为一个人偷东西，坏了大家的名誉。”从此以后，偷的现象再也没有了。而偷的人也弄清了这个道理，而决心改过。
    纺纱间工人从在去年十二月十三日起到今年二月间预计两个月安装一万绽子的细纱机。由于工人树立了新劳动态度，突破了过去阎匪统治时期六十多个工安装一台纺纱机的纪录，创造了平均十八个工安装一部纺纱机的新纪录。结果于一月九号提前卅三天就完成了全部计划。他们计划这个工厂不仅能恢复到抗战以前的四万二千多绽子，而且能扩大到五万多绽子！
