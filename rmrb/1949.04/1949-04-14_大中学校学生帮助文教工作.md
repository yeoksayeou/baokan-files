　　▲Students from the Peking University Medical College and the Public Security Bureau jointly organized the Peking University Workers' Night School. Classes are held from 7:00 PM to 9:00 PM, and students are divided into three levels based on their educational background. The curriculum includes Chinese language, arithmetic, social sciences, social development history, natural sciences, history and geography, hygiene knowledge, music, dance, drama, etc. Peking University students serve as teachers. More than 100 people participate in the learning, including Peking University workers and police, the Junshi sewing unit, the Heitasi sewing unit, and a small number of housewives.

　　▲To help out-of-school children, students from the Municipal Senior Technical School have established children's literacy classes in their spare time. There are currently ten classes with 247 children. The faculty and staff consist of 36 enthusiastic students from the school, using the Third District Eighth Bao National School as the classroom address.

　　▲The literacy class for poor children established by Xiehua Girls' Middle School has been in session for more than a month. Students from the school act as "little teachers," teaching for two hours each day.
