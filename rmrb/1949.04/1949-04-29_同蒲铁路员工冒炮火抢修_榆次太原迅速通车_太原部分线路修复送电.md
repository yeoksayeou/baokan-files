Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 28th: Tongpu Railway employees braved intense artillery fire to complete the emergency repairs of the Yuci-Taiyuan section of the railway. On the 24th, immediately after the liberation of Taiyuan, the first train, fully loaded with personnel from the Taiyuan Military Control Commission, safely arrived at Taiyuan South Station. On the afternoon of the 21st, while fierce fighting was taking place in the suburbs of Taiyuan, the Tongpu Railway Bureau organized 132 employees to rush to the front to repair the railway. Thanks to thorough prior preparation and the high level of awareness and enthusiasm of the employees, work progressed extremely rapidly. By 12:00 that night, they had erected the eight-li long line from Wusu to Beiguan. When the workers and citizens of Taiyuan saw the first train entering Nanguan, they were full of praise.

Taiyuan Dispatch: All employees of the Taiyuan Electricity Management Office and the city's power plant quickly assembled to repair the lines three hours after the end of the war. After the active and arduous work of all employees, the first communication line (the connection line between the city and the outside power plant) was restored by dusk on the 25th.

After our People's Liberation Army broke through the city walls, the wicked Yan bandits deployed three artillery groups on the south, north, and east sides of the power plant, making the power plant the focus of artillery fire. The plant was hit by more than 40 shells, with the boiler section alone suffering eight hits; the line damage was even more severe, with all high-voltage and low-voltage lines in the city being cut. At 11:00 a.m. on the 24th, the electricity takeover team arrived at the plant and immediately carried out propaganda and mobilization among the employees to quickly resume work. In the afternoon, more than 60 workers set out to actively repair the lines. The workers did not sleep for two nights and did not eat for one day amidst the artillery fire. In order to quickly restore the first communication line and connect it with the power plant outside the city to supply the city with light and water, all the workers assembled again at 6:00 a.m. the next morning. Thanks to the active repairs by the line workers, the first communication line, which was twelve li long, was repaired by dusk on the 25th. Employees of the boiler room checked and repaired the machines all night long, and power and water were supplied to the divisions and districts at 9:00 p.m. on the same day. All projects are continuing to be repaired.
