    Transferring More and Better Products to Support the Whole Country
    A Large Quantity of Daily-Use Industrial Goods Transferred Out of Guangzhou
    (Reported by this newspaper) Guangzhou's light industry departments, in the spirit of "the whole country as a single chessboard," are providing more and better daily-use light industrial products to markets across the country.
    The majority of Guangzhou's light industrial products are sold throughout the country. In the first quarter of this year, a total of more than 570,000 dozens of flashlights were sold, of which more than 500,000 dozens were sold to twenty-six provinces and cities; 1.36 million dozens of flashlight batteries were shipped out, accounting for more than 74% of the total sales volume. The number of sewing machines, toothpaste, and small commodities such as shears, lighters, nail clippers, small knives, and belts shipped to other places exceeded or approached half of the total sales volume. Moreover, with the increasing development of production, the quantity and variety supplied to the whole country are constantly increasing. The number of enamel washbasins shipped to various places in the first twenty days of April was equivalent to the total of the previous two months; 400,000 mugs, equivalent to the total number transferred out in the first quarter. In addition, cloth-topped rubber shoes, high-grade cigarettes, matches, candies, biscuits and other commodities were also transferred to various places.
    In order to transfer more and better products to support the whole country, Guangzhou's light industrial enterprises have also adopted many effective measures this year. In addition to trying every means to increase the supply of raw materials, they have also successively included some products that urgently need to increase production, such as scissors, buttons, bone combs, wooden clogs, rain hats, etc., into the city's plan according to market conditions. Therefore, the number of products belonging to the city's planned products has expanded from more than thirty in the past to more than one hundred. Some light industrial factories that have already changed their business are also being re-enlisted as needed and possible. The output of thirteen major products, such as soap, matches, toothpaste, pencils, paper, and flashlights, has increased to varying degrees compared with the same period last year.

    把更多更好的产品支援全国
    广州大批日用工业品外调
    本报讯　广州市轻工业部门，根据“全国一盘棋”的精神，正在为各地市场提供更多更好的日用轻工业品。
    广州的轻工业产品，大部分是运销到全国各地的。今年第一季度共销售手电筒五十七万多打，其中有五十万多打远销给二十六个省市；手电池运出一百三十六万打，为总销售额的74％强。缝纫机、牙膏以及小百货中的轧剪、打火机、指甲钳、小刀、皮带等产品，运往外地的数量都超过总销售额的半数或接近半数。而且随着生产的日益发展，供应全国的数量和品种正在不断增加。4月份前二十天运往各地的搪瓷面盆相当于前两个月的总和；口杯四十万个，相当于第一季度调出的总数。另外，还调给各地布面胶鞋、高级香烟、火柴、糖果、饼干等商品。
    为了把更多更好的产品支援全国，今年广州市的轻工业企业，还采取了许多有效措施，他们除了千方百计增加原材料供应外，还根据市场的情况，陆续把一些急需增加生产的产品，如剪刀、钮扣、骨梳、木屐、雨帽等列入市的计划内。因此属于全市计划产品的数量，已从过去的三十多种扩大到一百多种。对已经转业的一些轻工业厂，也按需要和可能重新归队。肥皂、火柴、牙膏、铅笔、纸、电筒等十三种主要产品的产量，都比去年同期有不同程度的增长。
