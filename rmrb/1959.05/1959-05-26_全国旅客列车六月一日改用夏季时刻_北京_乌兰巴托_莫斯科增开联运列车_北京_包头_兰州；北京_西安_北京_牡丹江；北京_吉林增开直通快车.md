　　National Passenger Trains to Adopt Summer Schedule on June 1st
　　Beijing – Ulaanbaatar – Moscow to Add Joint Through Train Service
　　Beijing – Baotou – Lanzhou; Beijing – Xi'an
　　Beijing – Mudanjiang; Beijing – Jilin to Add Direct Express Trains

　　(Our Dispatch) Starting from 00:00 on June 1st, national railway passenger trains will switch to the summer schedule.

　　Concurrently, an additional international joint through train will operate between Beijing and Moscow via Ulaanbaatar, running once a week in both directions. The launch of this train service holds significant importance for the close exchanges between international friends from China, Mongolia, and the Soviet Union. Its route is 1,130 kilometers shorter than the Beijing to Moscow train via Manzhouli, reducing travel time by nine hours and thirty minutes.

　　Direct express trains have also been added on major domestic lines such as: Beijing via Baotou to Lanzhou, Beijing – Xi'an, Beijing – Mudanjiang, and Beijing – Jilin.

　　The Beijing – Baotou – Lanzhou direct passenger express train will operate three times a week in both directions. The travel distance is 60 kilometers shorter than the express train from Beijing via Zhengzhou to Lanzhou, with a travel time reduction of one hour and thirty minutes. Non-transfer transport vehicles have also been added between Beijing and Chengdu. Furthermore, there have been increases in other passenger train lines and improvements in travel times.

　　However, this time the travel time for the express train between Beijing and Shanghai will be four hours longer than the current actual time; the express train between Beijing and Guangzhou will be more than three hours longer than the current actual time. This is because: the newly commissioned double-track Tianjin-Pukou Railway and Beijing-Guangzhou Railway have reduced the allowable speed in sections from the current 100 kilometers on single-track lines to 50 kilometers. In addition, the number of carriages coupled to the trains has increased by one on the Tianjin-Pukou line and by two on the Beijing-Guangzhou line.

    全国旅客列车六月一日改用夏季时刻
    北京——乌兰巴托——莫斯科增开联运列车
    北京——包头——兰州；北京——西安
    北京——牡丹江；北京——吉林增开直通快车
    本报讯  全国铁路旅客列车，将自6月1日零点起改用夏季时刻。
    和这同时，北京经由乌兰巴托到莫斯科增加了一趟国际联运列车，每周运行一往返。这趟列车的开行，对中、蒙、苏三国间国际友人的密切往来有着重要的意义，它的运行距离比北京经由满洲里到莫斯科的列车缩短一千一百三十公里。运行时间缩短九时三十分。
    国内各主要干线如：北京经由包头到兰州，北京——西安，北京——牡丹江，北京——吉林间都增开了直通快车。
    北京——包头——兰州间的直通旅客快车，每周运行三往返。运行距离比北京经由郑州到兰州的快车缩短六十公里，运行时间缩短一时三十分。北京——成都间还增加了不换乘运输车辆。此外，其他各线旅客列车也有所增加，时间也有所改善。
    但这次北京——上海间的快车运行时间比现行实际延长了四小时；北京——广州间快车比现行实际延长了三小时多。这是因为：津浦线和京广线的复线新交付使用，区间的线路容许速度由目前单线的一百公里降低为五十公里，加之列车编挂辆数津浦线增加一辆，京广线增加二辆。
