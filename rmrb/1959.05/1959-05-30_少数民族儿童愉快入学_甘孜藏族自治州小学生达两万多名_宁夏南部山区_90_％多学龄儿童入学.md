Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, May 29th. Since the democratic reforms began in Ganzi Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Sichuan Province, in 1956, one ethnic middle school, one ethnic normal school, and over one hundred rural and pasture elementary schools have been newly built. Thousands upon thousands of liberated peasants are sending their children to school. Currently, the number of elementary school students has reached over 24,000.

For thousands of years, children of farmers and herdsmen in the autonomous prefecture were deprived of the right to education and literacy under the cruel feudal serf system. The serf owners never established a single school for the masses. After liberation, the People's Government vigorously established schools, but the serf owners tried every possible way to sabotage this, deceiving and threatening the masses, and forbidding them from sending their children to school. Therefore, before the democratic reforms, only dozens of elementary schools were established in towns in Tibetan areas, with over 5,000 Tibetan children enrolled. The two middle schools were located in Luding, a Han Chinese area, and Kangding, the capital of the autonomous prefecture.

With the advancement of democratic reforms and the establishment of agricultural production cooperatives, the broad masses of farmers and herdsmen in the autonomous prefecture urgently demanded to learn culture. In areas such as Ganzi, Daofu, and Batang, a new phenomenon emerged from rural villages to pastures: masses bringing their children to cadres and requesting schools be established. In Longdeng and Bao Bianxi Townships of Qianning County, more than 300 out of over 500 households submitted applications for establishing schools. In many places, farmers themselves found houses, borrowed desks and benches to build schools, and requested the government to send teachers. Zeren Quezha, who used to wander around begging in Bamei Township, sent both of his children to school. He said, "We want to develop production; how can we do it without culture?" Over 90%, even 100% in some cases, of the newly built schools are children of the laboring masses. Almost all of the more than 110 students in Sexidi Township Elementary School in Ganzi County are children of former "Chaba," "Keba," and "Wazi" (i.e., serfs and domestic slaves).

To help farmers and herdsmen liberate themselves culturally, the autonomous prefecture has been providing students with free textbooks and stationery since liberation, and providing stipends to students from families with greater financial difficulties, and in some cases even providing cotton clothing.

To cultivate teachers, the autonomous prefecture also established an ethnic normal school and opened many short-term training classes and rotational training classes, and has already trained over 200 Tibetan teachers.

Xinhua News Agency, Yinchuan, May 29th. A new outlook has emerged in the elementary education undertaking in the southern mountainous areas of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, where the Hui people live in concentrated communities.

The southern mountainous areas of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region include counties such as Guyuan, Xiji, and Haiyuan. The Liupan Mountains run across the middle, with large mountains, deep gullies, and vast areas. The Hui population accounts for more than half of the total population of the region. In the early days after liberation, the education undertaking here was very backward. Many villages and towns did not have a single school, and it was difficult to find literate people. After 1953, Guyuan and other areas successively established autonomous prefectures. Under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, education undertakings were vigorously developed. Since then, elementary education for the Hui people has developed rapidly. Now, the number of children enrolled in this backward mountainous area has reached more than 90% of the total number of school-age children. The Guyuan Special Zone has 1,207 elementary schools, with over 96,000 enrolled children, accounting for 91.5% of the eligible children. Every commune in the mountainous area has one or two elementary schools.

The Hui and Han people in the mountainous area have a high enthusiasm for running schools. They provide their own labor and materials, and cultivate their own teachers, and have established many schools. (Photo attached)

    少数民族儿童愉快入学
    甘孜藏族自治州小学生达两万多名
    宁夏南部山区90％多学龄儿童入学
    新华社成都29日电　四川省甘孜藏族自治州自1956年开始民主改革以后，已新建民族中学、民族师范各一所和一百多个农村、牧场小学，成千上万个翻了身的农民把子女送入学校读书。现在，小学生人数已达二万四千多名。
    千百年来，自治州广大农牧民的子弟在残酷的封建农奴制度下，被剥夺了受教育、学文化的权利。农奴主们从来没有为群众办过一所学校，解放以后人民政府大力兴办学校，农奴主们还千方百计地进行破坏，欺骗和威胁群众，不准他们送子弟入学。因此民主改革前，藏族地区只在城镇建立了几十所小学，有五千多名藏族儿童入学。两所中学则设立在汉族地区的泸定和自治州首府康定。
    随着民主改革的进行和农业生产合作社的建立，自治州各地广大农牧民迫切要求学习文化。甘孜、道孚、巴塘等地区，从农村到牧场，都出现了群众带着子女找干部要求办学的新景象。乾宁县龙登、包卞西乡五百多户人家，就有三百多户提出办学的申请。许多地方农民自己找好房子，借出桌椅板凳建成学校，要求政府派教师去。八美乡从前到处流浪乞讨的泽仁却扎，把自己两个孩子都送进学校。他说：“我们要发展生产，没有文化怎么行？”各地新建的学校90％以上甚至百分之百都是劳动群众的子女。甘孜县色西底乡小学的一百一十多个学生，几乎全部都是过去的“差巴”、“科巴”和“娃子”（即农奴和家奴）的子女。
    为了帮助农牧民们在文化上翻身，自治州从解放以来就免费发给学生们课本和文具，对家庭经济比较困难的学生给予助学金，有的还发给棉衣。
    为培养师资，自治州还创办了民族师范学校，开办许多短期训练班和轮训班，已培养了二百多名藏族教师。
    新华社银川29日电　宁夏回族自治区回族人民聚居的南部山区，小学教育事业出现了新景象。
    宁夏回族自治区南部山区包括固原、西吉、海原等县，六盘山横亘在中间，山大沟深，地域辽阔，回族人口占全区总人口一半以上。解放初期，这里教育事业很落后，很多村镇没有一所学校，很难找到识字的人。1953年后，固原地区等先后成立了自治州，在共产党和人民政府的领导下大力兴办教育事业，从此，回族人民的小学教育迅速地发展起来。现在，这个落后的山区入学儿童达到学龄儿童总数的90％以上。固原专区已有小学一千二百零七所，入学儿童九万六千多人，占适龄儿童91.5％。山区里每个公社都有一所到两所小学。
    山区回汉人民兴办学校的积极性很高，他们自出工料、自己培养师资，办了许多学校。（附图片）
