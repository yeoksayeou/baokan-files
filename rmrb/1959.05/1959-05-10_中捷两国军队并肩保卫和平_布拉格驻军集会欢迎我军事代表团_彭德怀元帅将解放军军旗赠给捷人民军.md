Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 8th. More than 3,000 troops from the Czechoslovak capital garrison and troops scheduled for inspection on National Day held a rally this afternoon in Prague's Vochichek Park, where flowers were in full bloom, to welcome the Chinese military friendship delegation headed by Marshal Peng Dehuai, Vice Premier of the State Council and Minister of National Defense.

    Czechoslovak Minister of National Defense Lomsky spoke at the meeting. He said that the common goals of building socialism and defending the socialist camp closely link the people of Czechoslovakia and China. The foundation of our unbreakable unity is Marxist-Leninist thought. This unity cannot be broken by any imperialists or revisionists.

    He said that U.S. imperialism and other imperialists are stubbornly pursuing a policy of war, intensifying the international situation, and the arming of West Germany is a serious threat to European peace. In the Far East, U.S. imperialism is also threatening peace.

    He emphasized that we fully endorse and support the Soviet proposal for a peace treaty with Germany and an end to the occupation regime in West Berlin. We firmly oppose the U.S. imperialists' interference in China's internal affairs and the conspiracy to create "two Chinas". The government of the People's Republic of China is the only legal government of China. The U.S. imperialist occupation of Taiwan is a crude violation of China's territorial sovereignty.

    He concluded by saying that if imperialism dares to launch a war, it will surely be utterly defeated. The Czechoslovak People's Army is a solid link in the armed forces of the Warsaw Pact member states, and it vigilantly defends the peaceful construction of the socialist camp together with the armies of socialist countries, and will never allow any enemy to invade.

    Marshal Peng Dehuai then spoke. He said that the Chinese people and army are very pleased to see that the Czechoslovak people have made great achievements in the cause of socialist construction under the leadership of the Czechoslovak Communist Party. We wish the Czechoslovak people a victorious realization of the goals set by the 11th Congress of the Czechoslovak Communist Party under the leadership of Comrade Novotny.

    He pointed out that the Czechoslovak Communist Party is loyal to the principles of proletarian internationalism, adheres to the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and has waged a resolute and irreconcilable struggle against the imperialist forces and modern revisionists who attempt to undermine the socialist camp and the international communist movement. The Chinese People's Liberation Army, like the Soviet Army, the Czechoslovak Army, and the armies of all socialist countries, is armed with Marxist-Leninist thought and with the spirit of communist internationalism.

    Marshal Peng Dehuai continued, "China and Czechoslovakia are both members of the socialist camp family headed by the Soviet Union. Although our two countries are located at the eastern outpost of the socialist camp and the western outpost of the socialist camp, the great cause of communism closely links the people and armies of our two countries. The Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army cherish the fraternal friendship between our two peoples and armies as they cherish their own eyes."

    Marshal Peng Dehuai went on to say that the imperialist camp headed by the United States is adhering to a policy of aggression and war, and in Western Europe they are making every effort to support the militarist forces of West Germany, attempting to obstruct the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany and the end of the occupation regime in West Berlin. Under these circumstances, we must not relax our vigilance against the imperialist warmongers.

    Marshal Peng Dehuai emphasized that the Chinese government and people fully agree with and support the various efforts made by the Soviet Union, the German Democratic Republic, and the Czechoslovak Republic to peacefully resolve the German question. We hope that the upcoming East-West Foreign Ministers' Conference in Geneva can create a good atmosphere and conditions for the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany and the safeguarding of European peace. He said that the 650 million Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army will forever unite with the people and armies of socialist countries and advance shoulder to shoulder along the broad road of socialism. Victory will always belong to us!

    After the speech, Marshal Peng Dehuai, on behalf of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, presented a PLA flag to the Czechoslovak People's Army. Minister Lomsky accepted the gift and warmly embraced Marshal Peng Dehuai. At this moment, the entire audience stood up and cheered.

    The Czechoslovak People's Army Song and Dance Troupe concluded with a wonderful performance.

　　中捷两国军队并肩保卫和平
    布拉格驻军集会欢迎我军事代表团
    彭德怀元帅将解放军军旗赠给捷人民军
    新华社布拉格8日电　捷克斯洛伐克首都驻军和国庆受检阅的部队三千多人今天下午在布拉格市内百花盛开的伏契克公园里举行集会，欢迎以国务院副总理兼国防部长彭德怀元帅为首的中国军事友好代表团。
    捷克斯洛伐克国防部长洛姆斯基在会上讲了话。他说，建设社会主义和捍卫社会主义阵营的共同目标把捷中两国人民紧紧地联系起来。我们牢不可破的团结的基础是马克思列宁主义思想。这种团结是任何帝国主义者和修正主义者所不能破坏的。
    他说，美帝国主义和其他帝国主义正在顽固地执行着战争政策，使国际局势紧张化，武装西德对欧洲和平是严重的威胁。在远东美帝国主义也正在威胁着和平。
    他强调说，我们完全拥护和支持苏联提出的关于缔结对德和约和结束西柏林占领制度的建议。我们坚决反对美帝国主义者干涉中国内政和制造“两个中国”的阴谋。只有中华人民共和国政府是中国唯一的合法政府。美帝国主义者侵占台湾是对中国领土主权的粗暴破坏。
    他最后说，如果帝国主义胆敢发动战争，它一定遭到彻底失败。捷克斯洛伐克人民军是华沙条约成员国武装力量中巩固的一环，它同社会主义各国军队警惕地捍卫着社会主义阵营的和平建设，决不让任何敌人侵犯。
    彭德怀元帅接着讲了话。他说，中国人民和军队十分高兴地看到，捷克斯洛伐克人民在捷克斯洛伐克共产党领导下在社会主义建设事业中已经取得了巨大的成就。我们预祝捷克斯洛伐克人民在以诺沃提尼同志为首的捷克斯洛伐克共产党领导下胜利地实现捷共第十一次代表大会规定的目标。
    他指出，捷克斯洛伐克共产党忠于无产阶级国际主义原则，坚持以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结，同企图破坏社会主义阵营和国际共产主义运动的帝国主义势力和现代修正主义者进行了坚决的不调和的斗争。中国人民解放军和苏联军队、捷克斯洛伐克军队以及各社会主义国家的军队一样都是用马克思列宁主义思想用共产主义国际主义精神武装起来的。
    彭德怀元帅接着说，中、捷两国都是以苏联为首的社会主义阵营大家庭中的成员。虽然我们两国一个处在社会主义阵营的东方前哨，一个处在社会主义阵营的西方前哨，但是伟大的共产主义事业把我们两国人民和军队紧紧地联系在一起。中国人民和中国人民解放军像爱护眼珠一样地爱护我们两国人民和军队之间的兄弟友谊。
    彭德怀元帅接着说，以美国为首的帝国主义阵营正在坚持侵略和战争政策，在西欧它们竭力扶持西德的军国主义势力，力图阻挠缔结对德和约和结束西柏林的占领制度。在这种情况下我们对帝国主义战争狂人决不能放松警惕。
    彭德怀元帅强调说，中国政府和人民完全同意并支持苏联、德意志民主共和国和捷克斯洛伐克共和国对和平解决德国问题所作的各种努力。我们希望即将在日内瓦举行的东西方外长会议能够为缔结对德和约、保障欧洲和平创造出良好的气氛和条件。他说，六亿五千万中国人民和中国人民解放军将和社会主义各国人民和军队永远地团结在一起，沿着社会主义的康庄大道并肩前进。胜利永远属于我们！
    讲话后，彭德怀元帅代表中国人民解放军将一面解放军军旗赠给捷克斯洛伐克人民军。洛姆斯基部长接受了献礼，并和彭德怀元帅热烈拥抱，这时全场起立欢呼。
    捷克斯洛伐克人民军歌舞团最后演出了精彩的节目。
