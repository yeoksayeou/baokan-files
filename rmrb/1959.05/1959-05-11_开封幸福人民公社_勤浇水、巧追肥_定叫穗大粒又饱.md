Kaifeng Happiness People's Commune
Diligently Water and Skillfully Topdress
To Ensure Large and Full Ears of Grain

(Our dispatch) The Happiness People's Commune in Kaifeng County, Henan, is extensively irrigating wheat during the heading and grain-filling stages and skillfully applying topdressing fertilizer to boost grain development.

When the commune began widespread irrigation of wheat during grain filling and intensive application of topdressing fertilizer, some cadres and masses believed that the wheat was growing well and had already headed, nearing maturity, so further management would not be effective! In response, the commune party committee convened a forum with brigade secretaries and experienced farmers, and organized open discussions. During the discussions, middle peasant Zhang Jinbao said: “Drought harms old crops, and autumn drought harms small crops. Wheat cannot be watered now; the drier and windier, the better.” Production team leader Zhao Guoyi said: “Wheat has been watered and fertilized three or four times already, and it’s growing so well. To add more fertilizer and water would be like trying to make noodles from inside an eggshell, not much potential.” Liu Yunzhang added: “Although the wheat is growing well this year, it is dense and vigorous. If we don't continue to apply fertilizer and water, no matter how well it grows, it won't increase production.” Party Branch Secretary Xu Jing said: Last year, the thirty mu of poor wheat in Liu Tie's Second Production Team were not growing well. When the wheat was heading, they applied topdressing fertilizer and watered it thoroughly. As a result, the ears were large and the grains were full, averaging 210 jin per mu. The neighboring land, which was the same type, only yielded 125 jin per mu because it was not managed, a difference of 85 jin per mu. Through the forum, they unified their thinking and summarized the benefits of irrigating during the heading and grain-filling stages and applying topdressing fertilizer: it can strengthen the stalks, prevent lodging, turn poor land into good land, and promote full grain development. Through discussion, the broad masses of cadres and the masses were encouraged, and a late-stage management campaign was launched rapidly.

    开封幸福人民公社
    勤浇水、巧追肥
    定叫穗大粒又饱
    本报讯　河南开封县幸福公社大浇小麦抽穗、灌浆水，巧追小麦攻籽肥。
    该社在开始大浇小麦灌浆水和大追攻籽肥时，一部分干部和群众认为，麦子长的好，又抽穗了，离成熟期已近，再管也用不上劲啦！公社党委根据这一情况，召开了大队支书、老农座谈会，组织了鸣放辩论。在辩论中，中农张进保说：麦旱老，秋旱小，现在麦子不能浇水，越旱越刮风越好。生产队长赵国义说：“麦子不断浇水，已追三、四遍肥啦，麦子长的这么好，要再追肥浇水，也是鸡蛋壳里发面，没有多大开头。”刘云章接着说：“今年麦子长的虽好，但麦稠又旺，如不继续追肥浇水，长的再好也不能增产。”党支书徐敬说：去年刘铁第二生产队的三十亩孬麦，长的不像样，在抽穗时，追了一次肥，又普浇一遍水，结果长的穗大粒饱，每亩平均打二百一十斤。邻边的同样地，因没管理，每亩只打一百二十五斤，每亩就相差八十五斤。通过座谈，统一了思想，并总结了浇抽穗灌浆水和追攻籽肥的好处：能壮秆；防倒伏；孬地能变良田；能攻饱籽。通过辩论，鼓舞了广大干部和群众，后期管理运动迅速地开展起来了。
