Xinhua News Agency dispatch from Washington: The "International Economic Development Committee," organized by American big business, held a meeting on the 4th to discuss the political and economic situation in India. Participants included US Vice President Nixon and more than three hundred representatives of large corporations, private groups, and government agencies from both the United States and India.

According to Committee Chairman Johnston, the purpose of convening this meeting was "to focus attention on the development of India at a time when events in Asia are showing that India's democracy is of key significance to the future of freedom in Asia." Sources say that recently, many political and business figures in the United States have been advocating increased understanding of and efforts to win over India. The topics discussed at this committee meeting included India's role in world affairs, the so-called "competition" between India and China in economic development, the political situation in India, American industry's "opportunities" in India, and the aims and results of India's Five-Year Plan, among others. This is the first time the committee has held a meeting to discuss the issues of a single country separately.

US Vice President Nixon and former New York Governor Harriman advocated at the meeting that the United States vigorously "aid" India to carry out the so-called competition between India and China in economic development.

According to an Associated Press dispatch, Nixon stated at the meeting on the 4th that for the capitalist world, "developments in India over the next five to ten years may be more important than the upcoming negotiations with the Communists on the Berlin issue." The dispatch said that Nixon said, "The whole world is watching the struggle between Communist China and India in Asia to seek progress." He said that Communist China "is seeking progress without freedom," while India is "committed to achieving the same goal through democratic means."

The message said that Nixon believes: "The question to be answered in the next five to ten years is whether India can achieve this progress while maintaining freedom, or whether it must achieve its progress at the cost of sacrificing democratic methods." It is said that Nixon emphasized that "the answer to this question is of great importance not only to the newly established countries in Asia and Africa, but also to Latin America."

Nixon advocated that the United States step up aid to India, saying that government funds and private capital "are necessary" in the United States' "aid" to India, but private capital should be the mainstay.

Former New York Governor and big capitalist Harriman also said at the meeting on the evening of the 4th: "Although India insists that it pursues a policy of non-alignment, in fact, it is one of our most important allies, and is by no means neutral in terms of basic democratic principles, on which our country (referring to the United States) is based." He said: "I strongly feel that we should cooperate with European industrial countries and Japan to try to find sufficient financial resources (for India). This can be done on a specific basis or through the United Nations."

Harriman had recently visited India and also explained to American capitalists that some Americans seemed uncomfortable because the Indian government said their goal was "socialism." He said, "For me, I think it is a good thing that they use this word. Among the people of Asia, this is a very popular word, where capitalism is almost equal to colonialism, or almost synonymous with colonialism. The Indians took this word from the Communists…".

According to another report, US Senator Kennedy said in a speech to the North California World Affairs Council on the evening of the 2nd that Western countries must support India's "race" with China with an investment of $1 billion a year, otherwise, India's "role as a counterweight to Communist China will be lost, and communism will win its greatest bloodless victory," and "the entire free world will suffer a serious setback." Kennedy called for stabilizing the Development Loan Fund and suggested that Western countries establish an international joint mission to help India achieve India's third five-year plan starting in 1961.

### 美国财阀政客集会讨论印度局势  尼克松鼓吹美国应大力“援助”印度

    美国财阀政客集会讨论印度局势
    尼克松鼓吹美国应大力“援助”印度
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯华盛顿消息：由美国大企业家组织的“国际经济发展委员会”4日举行会议，讨论印度的政治和经济局势。参加会议的有美国副总统尼克松和美印两国的三百多个大公司、私人团体和政府机构的代表。
    据委员会主席约翰斯顿说，召开这次会议是“要在亚洲的事件正在表明印度的民主对亚洲的自由的未来有着关键意义的时候，使大家集中注意印度的发展问题。”有消息说，最近一个时期以来，美国国内许多政界和企业界人士一直在鼓吹对印度加强了解和进行拉拢活动。委员会这次会议讨论的题目就包括印度在世界事务中的作用，印度和中国在经济发展方面的所谓“竞争”、印度的政治局势、美国工业在印度的“机会”以及印度的五年计划的目的和结果等等。这是委员会第一次单独讨论一个国家的问题的会议。
    美国副总统尼克松和前纽约州州长哈里曼在会议上鼓吹美国大力“援助”印度，以进行所谓印度和中国在经济发展方面的竞争。
    据美联社的一条消息说，尼克松4日在这个会议上表示，对资本主义世界来说，“印度在今后五年到十年内的事态发展可能比就要到来的同共产党人在柏林问题上的谈判更加重要”。这条消息说，尼克松说，“整个世界正在注视共产党中国和印度在亚洲进行的谋求进步的斗争”。他说，共产党中国“正在不要自由的情况下谋取进步”，而印度是“在致力于通过民主的方法来达到同样的目的”。
    消息说，尼克松认为：“在今后五年到十年内要回答的问题是，印度能够在保持自由的情况下获得这种进步呢，还是必须以牺牲民主的方法作为代价来获得它的进步”。据说尼克松强调“这个问题的答案不仅对亚洲和非洲新成立的国家有极大的重要性，对拉丁美洲也是这样。”
    尼克松鼓吹美国加紧援助印度，他说，在美国对印度的“援助”中政府的基金和私人资本“都是必要的”，但是应以私人资本为主。
    美国前纽约州长、大资本家哈里曼4日晚也在这个会议上说：“虽然印度坚持说它奉行一种不参加集团的政策，事实上，它是我们最重要的盟国之一，并且就基本的民主原则来说决不是中立的，我们的国家（指美国）就是基于这些原则的”。他说：“我强烈的感到，我们应该与欧洲的工业国家以及日本合作，设法（为印度）找到足够的财源。这件事可以在特定的基础上进行，或者通过联合国。”
    哈里曼不久前刚到过印度，他还向美国资本家们解释说，由于印度政府说它们的目标是“社会主义”，有些美国人看来很不妥。他说，“对我来说，我认为他们用这个字眼是一件好事情。在亚洲人民中间，这是一个非常得人心的字眼，在那里资本主义几乎等于殖民主义，或者说几乎是殖民主义的同义语。印度人从共产党手里把这个字拿了过来……”。
    另据报道，美国参议员肯尼迪2日晚在北加利福尼亚世界事务委员会讲话时说，西方国家必须以每年十亿美元的投资来支持印度同中国进行“竞赛”，要不然，印度“作为共产党中国的抗衡者的作用便将失去，共产主义将赢得它最巨大的不流血的胜利”，“整个自由世界将遭受一次严重的挫败”。肯尼迪要求稳定发展贷款基金会，并建议西方国家建立一个国际联合使团来帮助印度实现从1961年开始的印度第三个五年计划。
