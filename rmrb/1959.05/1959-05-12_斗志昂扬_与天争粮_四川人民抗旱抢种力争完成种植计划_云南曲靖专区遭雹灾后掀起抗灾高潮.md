Chengdu, May 11 (This newspaper dispatches) Sichuan Province's People's Communes have mobilized a vast army to wage a struggle against the severe drought. In recent days, plentiful rains have fallen, and the broad masses are seizing the opportunity to store and conserve water, striving for full planting to ensure the comprehensive completion of sowing and transplanting plans for all crops.

Since the beginning of spring, the province has experienced very little rainfall, and the drought situation in many places is unprecedented in decades. Rice, cotton, corn, and other crops being planted or already planted have been greatly threatened. After the drought occurred, Party committees at all levels immediately mobilized the masses to fight the drought with all their strength, rushing to plant and transplant. Yibin, Luzhou, Jiangjin, Neijiang, and other prefectures with particularly severe drought conditions have established drought prevention and control headquarters at each level, with Party secretaries at all levels personally taking command, convening oath-taking rallies at each level, competing with the heavens for water, and demanding grain from the earth. After extensive and in-depth propaganda and education and a full airing of views and great debates, the Mianyang Prefecture inspired the commune members' fighting spirit of "man can conquer nature," and two million people invested themselves with full confidence in the movement to combat drought and protect seedlings, rushing to plant and transplant. After overcoming the passive mentality of a few cadres and masses who were waiting for rain, the Jiangjin Prefecture saw a new high tide in production with the deepening of the drought resistance movement.

In the struggle against drought, all localities have tried every possible means to utilize various water lifting tools, adopting a comprehensive combination of measures such as pumping, carting, carrying, diverting, digging, and moisturizing to ensure that stagnant water does not flow away and living water does not go to waste. Naxi County mobilized an army of 100,000 people, more than 4,700 waterwheels, more than 10,000 buckets, and 25,000 water ladles to rescue more than 50,000 mu of middle rice fields that had been cut off from water within three days, and promptly transplanted seedlings. At the same time, they also irrigated more than 10,000 mu of sweet potato seedlings, sorghum seedlings, and corn, and many seedlings that were about to wither grew green again. Hechuan County mobilized 130,000 people to fight day and night, and finally irrigated 220,000 mu of dry rice fields. All localities seized the opportunity to change the planting to dry crops in areas where the land had already cracked and there was no water source nearby.

After entering May, widespread welcome rains fell in various places, generally around 20 millimeters. The fighting spirit of the masses in all localities became even higher. They seized the favorable opportunity after the rain to rush to collect water, repair leaks, intercept and irrigate fields, and rush to plant and transplant. Farmers, students, workers, and cadres in organs in Mingshan County were almost entirely mobilized to rush to plant and transplant. After four hours of battle, all 80,000 mu of water-deficient fields in the county were irrigated with more than one inch of water. Quxian County mobilized more than 90,000 people at one time, irrigating more than 30,000 mu of rice fields that were about to dry up, and at the same time repairing more than 45,000 field edges and ridges. Nanchong Prefecture received more rainfall in various counties, and with the great rescue efforts of the masses, the drought situation of dry land crops has been eliminated. The area of rice fields in the whole region that originally could not be guaranteed for planting has now decreased from about 20% to about 10%. At present, the farmers in the entire region are taking advantage of the victory to expand the results. (Liu Zongtang)

Kunming, May 11 (This newspaper dispatches) Qujing Prefecture, Yunnan Province, has recently suffered three consecutive hailstorm attacks, and the masses in the disaster areas have launched a high tide of production and disaster relief with full confidence.

This disaster was mainly caused by hailstones mixed with gales, heavy rain, and mountain floods, which damaged many crops. Luoping, Rongfeng, and Qujing counties were particularly severely affected, with hailstones as large as eggs. In about twenty minutes, some flat land was piled up four or five inches deep, and general areas were also piled up one or two inches deep, which was very harmful to crops. According to preliminary statistics, nearly 200,000 mu of crops in five counties have been affected by the disaster, with a total loss of more than 20 million jin of grain. In addition, due to hailstones mixed with heavy rain, storms, and thunder, mountain torrents broke out in Tianchong Commune, Fuyuan County, and individual areas also suffered losses such as cattle and sheep being washed away and killed, and houses being blown down.

Party committees at all levels attach great importance to the disaster situation and the masses in the disaster areas and care deeply for them. County Party committees in all counties have taken timely emergency measures, transferring cadres to organize work groups, with Party secretaries personally taking command, and rushing to the disaster areas day and night to conduct disaster relief with the broad masses of grassroots cadres and the masses. After the disaster occurred on April 28, the Qujing County Party Committee immediately organized a condolence group of more than 100 people to go to the disaster-stricken communes to express their condolences. The next day, the county party committee organized nearly a thousand cadres, teachers and students, and employees of enterprise departments to go to the disaster areas to eat, live, and work with the masses and carry out production self-rescue. The financial and trade departments immediately sent people to purchase seeds and other materials to support production in the disaster areas. They have now prepared 200,000 jin of grain seeds, 140,000 jin of corn seeds, 630,000 jin of small grain seeds, and a portion of vegetable seeds, which are being transported to the disaster areas for supply. At the same time, pesticides, farm implements, and other materials have been organized and given priority to meet the production and living needs of the people in the disaster areas. At the same time, a pre-purchase fund of 150,000 yuan has been allocated and distributed to the disaster areas.

At present, the masses in the disaster areas have basically stabilized their thinking, boosted their energy, and launched a high tide of production and disaster relief. Heping Commune, Rongfeng County, is preparing to re-sow 175 mu of small seedlings, and has already soaked the seeds and tidied up the seedling fields; those small seedlings that have not been killed are generally being watered and fertilized, and actively rescued. Panlong Management Area, Panlong Commune, also organized more than 50 people to go to the fields to pick up barley that had been knocked down by the hailstones. Yanfang and other communes in Qujing County mobilized the masses to summarize and study disaster relief methods. Seedlings that have been affected by the disaster should be immediately re-sown, and measures should be taken to increase the height of the seedling fields and implement rapid seedling cultivation; potatoes that have been severely affected should be re-plowed and planted with spring crops, and those that have been less severely affected should be intercropped with small grains; spring crops and vegetables that have been damaged should be mobilized to pick up wheat ears, beans, and vegetable leaves to minimize losses. At the same time, everyone should take action to plant early-maturing crops on the edges of fields to make up for the losses, and rush to harvest the ripe spring crops. (Tian Liangeng)

    斗志昂扬　与天争粮
    四川人民抗旱抢种力争完成种植计划
    云南曲靖专区遭雹灾后掀起抗灾高潮
    本报成都11日电　四川省各人民公社出动千军万马和严重干旱展开斗争。最近几天，普降甘雨，广大群众正抓紧时机蓄水保水，力争满栽满插，保证全面完成各项作物的播种和栽插计划。
    全省入春以来落雨很少，许多地方旱象严重情况为几十年来所罕见。正在栽种和已栽种下去的水稻、棉花、玉米等都受到很大胁威。各级党委在旱象发生后立即发动群众，全力抗旱，抢栽抢种。宜宾、泸州、江津、内江等旱象特别严重的专区都逐级成立了防旱抗旱指挥部，各级党委书记亲自挂帅，层层召开誓师大会，与天争水，向地要粮。绵阳专区经过广泛深入的宣传教育和大鸣大放大辩论，激发了社员的人定胜天的斗志，有二百万人满怀信心投入抗旱保苗、抢栽抢种运动。江津专区克服了少数干部和群众的消极等天下雨的思想后，随着抗旱运动的深入开展，生产上出现新高潮。
    各地在和干旱斗争中，千方百计利用各种提水工具，采取抽、车、挑、引、挖、润等全面结合的措施，做到死水不走，活水不去。纳溪县出动十万大军、四千七百多架水车、一万多担水桶和二万五千个水篼，在三天内抢救了五万多亩断水的中稻田，并及时栽上了秧。同时还浇灌了一万多亩红薯苗、高粱秧和玉米，许多快要枯萎的苗子，又长得绿油油的了。合川县出动十三万人日夜奋战，终于使二十二万亩干涸的稻田灌上了水。各地对于已经干裂附近又无水源的地方，抓紧时机改种旱作物。
    进入5月以后，各地先后普降喜雨，一般都在二十公厘左右。各地群众斗志更加高昂。抓紧雨后有利时机，抢水补漏、截流灌田，抢栽抢种。名山县农民、学生、工人、机关干部几乎全部出动，抢栽抢种。经过四小时的战斗，把全县八万亩缺水田都灌上了一寸以上的水。渠县一次出动九万多人，把三万多亩快要干涸的稻田灌上了水，同时还整好田边田坎四万五千多条。南充专区各县下雨较多，再加群众大力抢救，现在旱地作物的旱象已经消除，全区原来20％的水田不能保栽，现已下降到10％左右。目前全区农民正在乘胜追击，扩大战果。　（刘宗棠）
    本报昆明11日电　云南省曲靖专区最近连续三次遭受冰雹袭击，灾区群众满怀信心地掀起了生产救灾的高潮。
    这次灾害主要是冰雹夹带着狂风、暴雨、山洪，伤害了许多农作物。其中尤以罗平、榕峰、曲靖等县比较严重，冰雹大的有鸡蛋大。在二十分钟左右的时间内，有的平地堆起四、五寸深，一般地区也堆起一、二寸深，对农作物的危害甚大。据初步统计，五个县先后受灾的农作物近二十万亩，总共损失粮食二千多万斤。此外，由于冰雹夹着大雨、暴风、巨雷，富源县田冲公社因山洪暴发，个别地区还遭到冲走、死伤牛、羊和吹倒房屋等损失。
    各级党委对此次灾情和受灾地区群众都十分重视和关怀。各县县委都及时地采取了紧急措施，抽调干部组织工作组，党委书记亲自挂帅，不分日夜地分别赶赴受灾地区，与广大基层干部、群众一道进行抗灾救灾。曲靖县委在4月28日灾情发生后，立即组织了一百多人的慰问组，分赴受灾公社进行慰问。第二天，县委又组织了机关干部、学校师生、企业部门职工近一千人，分赴灾区，与群众同吃同住同劳动，开展生产自救。财贸部门立即派人四出采购籽种和其他物资，支援灾区生产。目前已准备好谷种二十万斤、玉米种十四万斤、小杂粮种六十三万斤和一部分菜种，正陆续运往灾区供应。同时，还组织了农药、农具和其他物资，优先供应灾区人民的生产和生活需要。同时，还拨出了十五万元的预购款，发放给灾区。
    目前受灾地区的群众已基本上安定了思想，鼓起了干劲，掀起了生产救灾高潮。榕峰县和平公社准备补撒小秧一百七十五亩，已经泡种和整理秧田；对未打死的小秧，普遍进行车水晒秧和施肥，积极补救。盘龙公社盘龙管理区还组织了五十多人到田里拾回被冰雹打下的大麦。曲靖县炎方等公社发动群众总结研究了救灾办法，秧苗受灾的，立即补撒，并设法提高秧田涨度，实行快速育秧；洋芋受灾过重的重新翻犁，栽种大春作物，受灾较轻的套种小杂粮；小春和蔬菜受害的，发动群众拣回麦穗、豆粒、菜叶，把损失压缩到最低限度。同时，人人动手，利用田边地角，大种早熟作物，以弥补损失，并抢收已熟的小春。
