    Public and Private Raising Combined, Advanced and Backward Grasped Together
    Weinan's Animal Husbandry Achieves Comprehensive Development

    (This report) According to our newspaper, Weinan County, Shaanxi Province, implements the policy of emphasizing both public and private raising, enabling the comprehensive development of animal husbandry. In early May, this county was also rated as the top in the province's animal husbandry work at the on-site conference on animal husbandry work in Shaanxi Province.

    From the end of last year to May 20th, statistics show that the county's large livestock (including cattle, horses, donkeys, and mules) newly increased by 3,496 heads. After replenishing the 3,394 heads sold to other places and normally eliminated, it increased by 157 heads compared to the 97,276 heads at the end of last year. The number of pigs, after replenishing the more than 11,000 heads sold and slaughtered, increased from 58,614 heads at the end of last year to 67,214 heads. The number of sheep increased from 19,747 at the end of last year to 25,055.

    After communization in this county last year, the following new situations emerged in the development of animal husbandry: Communization provided good conditions for large-scale development of animal husbandry, but it is necessary to improve the level of managing animal husbandry; the widespread establishment of collective undertakings such as collective canteens created better conditions for collective breeding, but there is an urgent need to solve the problems of feed and fodder for livestock and poultry raised privately by commune members. At the same time, this county merged with the original Tongguan, Huayin, and Hua Counties, and the development of animal husbandry work was extremely unbalanced. The original Weinan County was the first in the province, while the original Tongguan County was the worst in the province.

    Based on the above new situations, the leading departments of Weinan County took a series of measures:

      (1) The whole Party took action to launch a mass movement. While rectifying the communes and grasping agricultural production in the spring of this year, the county, down to the production teams, designated a Party secretary and a county head, commune head, and production team leader to be responsible for leading animal husbandry work. The county systematically allocated a group of Party members, League members, and activists with good ideological awareness to serve as breeders and inseminators, forming the core force of animal husbandry work. Responsible cadres at all levels personally pulled breeding stock for insemination, setting off an insemination campaign. According to the unbalanced development of animal husbandry, Weinan County grasped both the advanced and the backward in its work. After holding an on-site conference in the advanced Guandao Commune to promote the experience of Guandao Commune, it concentrated its efforts to specifically help the most backward Tongguan Commune change the backward situation of animal husbandry work. After making significant achievements in a short period of time, it held an on-site conference in Tongguan Commune to promote their experience. The county held five on-site conferences from January to May this year. In its work, it grasped key points and also conducted large-scale inspections and comparisons extensively and in-depth. The county has listed animal husbandry work as an item in all major inspections and comparisons in conjunction with the central work.

      (2) Resolutely implement the policy of emphasizing both public and private raising. After communization, attention was first paid to grasping the collective animal husbandry, doing a good job in feeding management, and communes and production teams all set up livestock farms. At the same time, attention was also paid to encouraging commune members to develop livestock and poultry. In pig raising, three forms were implemented: public raising (pig farms run by the commune or team), private raising, and public-private joint raising (the commune or team supplies commune members with piglets and 100 jin of concentrated feed, which are raised by the commune members and then handed over to the commune or team, giving the commune members 50 workdays). Whether it is public or private raising, feed and fodder are treated equally and arranged in a unified manner. The slogan "Every household has a pig, every household has a nest of chickens" was put forward to mobilize and organize commune members to make full use of the idle land in front of and behind houses to grow feed and fodder, and to use idle labor in idle time to raise livestock and poultry. Recently, the county party committee decided that for every pig raised by a commune member, two cents of feed land will be allocated to solve the problem of feed and fodder. It is also stipulated that for every ten animals bred by a breeder, five to ten workdays will be awarded, and for every young animal kept, two yuan in cash will be awarded, and five to seven yuan in cash will be awarded for animals growing to six months, which not only gives play to the superiority of collective raising, but also gives play to the enthusiasm of individual breeders.

      (3) Conscientiously solve the ideological problems of cadres and commune members. In the development of animal husbandry, Weinan County often pays attention to studying and solving the ideological problems of cadres and the masses. For example, when Tongguan Commune launched a surprise breeding campaign in March, it was found that some people believed that: "Tongguan has high mountains and deep gullies, production is tight, work is heavy, it is not suitable for breeding, and even if it is bred, it cannot guarantee production and survival; it can only be bought from other places, not bred locally." Therefore, the commune held an on-site conference in Shuicun, Nanying Management District, organized more than 100 cadres, breeders, and inseminators to conduct a big debate; afterwards, each management district also separately selected key points and organized more than 200 breeders and inseminators to conduct visits and debates; the commune also widely carried out propaganda and education to all commune members, and quickly set off a breeding campaign.

### 公养私养并举  先进落后齐抓  渭南畜牧业全面发展

    公养私养并举  先进落后齐抓
    渭南畜牧业全面发展
    本报讯  陕西渭南县执行公养和私养并重的方针，使畜牧工作全面发展。5月初，这个县又被陕西省的畜牧工作现场会议评为全省畜牧工作的头一名。
    从去年年底到5月20日统计，全县大家畜（包括牛、马、驴、骡）新增加三千四百九十六头，除把卖给外地和正常淘汰的三千三百九十四头补起外，比去年年底的九万七千二百七十六头净增了一百五十七头；生猪除把已卖已杀的一万一千多头补起外，由去年年底的五万八千六百一十四头增加到六万七千二百一十四头；羊由去年年底的一万九千七百四十七只增加到二万五千零五十五只。
    这个县在去年公社化以后，在发展畜牧业方面，出现了下述新情况：公社化给大规模地发展畜牧业提供了良好的条件，但需要提高管理畜牧业的水平；集体食堂等集体事业的普遍兴办给集体饲养业创造了更好的条件，但急需解决社员私养家畜家禽中的饲草饲料等问题。同时这个县与原来的潼关、华阴、华县三县合并，原来的畜牧工作发展极不平衡，原渭南县是全省的第一名，原潼关县却是全省最差的。
    根据上述新的情况，渭南县的领导部门，采取了一系列的措施：
      （一）全党动手，大搞群众运动。全县在今年春季整顿公社和大抓农业生产的同时，从县到生产队，都指定一个党委书记和一个县长、社长和生产队长负责领导畜牧工作。全县有计划地配备了一批党员、团员和思想意识较好的积极分子去当饲养员、配种员，组成畜牧工作的核心力量。各级负责干部亲自拉种畜配种，掀起了配种运动。渭南县根据畜牧工作不平衡的情况，工作中既抓先进，也抓落后，在全县先进的官道公社召开现场会议，推广官道公社的经验后，又集中力量，具体帮助最落后的潼关公社改变畜牧工作的落后状况。在很短的时期内做出显著成绩后，又在潼关公社召开现场会议，推广他们的经验。全县今年1至5月份就召开了五次现场会议。工作中既抓重点，又普遍深入地进行大检查大评比。全县历次结合中心工作大检查大评比时都把畜牧工作列为一项。
      （二）坚决执行公养和私养并重的方针。公社化后，首先注意了抓集体的畜牧业，做好饲养管理工作，社社队队都办起了畜牧场。同时，也注意了鼓励社员发展家畜家禽。在养猪中实行了公养（由社或队办猪场）、私养、公私合养（社或队供给社员仔猪和一百斤精料，由社员养成后交给社或队，给社员记五十个劳动日）三种形式。在饲草饲料上不论公养的或私养的都同等看待，统一安排。提出“家家一头猪，户户一窝鸡”的口号，动员和组织社员，充分利用屋前院后的闲散土地种饲草饲料，利用闲散的劳动力，在闲散的时间饲养家畜家禽。最近县委又决定，社员每养一头猪，划给二分饲料地，解决饲草饲料问题。还规定饲养员饲养的牲畜，每满怀十个，奖五至十个劳动日，保住胎每产一个幼畜奖二元现金，长到六个月奖五至七元现金，既发挥了集体饲养的优越性，又发挥了饲养员个人的积极性。
      （三）认真解决干部、社员的思想问题。渭南县在发展畜牧业中，经常注意研究解决干部、群众中的思想问题。如潼关公社在3月间开展突击配种运动时，发现有些人认为：“潼关山高沟深，生产紧，活路重，不宜配种，配上也不能保产保活；只能向外地买，不能就地自繁自育。”于是公社就在南营管理区税村召开现场会议，组织一百多个干部、饲养员和配种员，开展了大鸣大放大辩论；之后，各管理区也都分别选择重点，组织二百多个饲养员、配种员进行参观和辩论；公社又广泛地向全社社员进行了宣传教育，迅速掀起了配种运动。
