People's communes in the sugar beet producing areas of Heilongjiang Province are seizing the opportunity of moist soil to continue a concentrated effort to sow sugar beets. As of May 26, the province had sown 1.87 million mu of sugar beets, accounting for 91% of the plan. According to the current sowing progress, it is expected that all sowing will be completed by early June.

During this year's spring plowing and sowing, the province experienced higher temperatures and more rainfall, thus the sugar beet sowing work started earlier and progressed faster than in previous years. Many areas began sowing sugar beets in mid-April. Due to the attention of Party and government leaders and the high enthusiasm of the masses, Kedu County completed its state-allocated planting task for 520,000 mu of sugar beets ahead of schedule in just over ten days from April 15 to May 4.

In order to achieve a greater harvest, all production units have selected fertile land and good stubble fields to sow sugar beets. 70% of the sugar beets in the province are sown on land that has been autumn-tilled or deeply plowed, of which about 65% are sown on fertile stubble fields of wheat, soybeans, and potatoes. 4,000 to 5,000 jin of base fertilizer are also applied per mu. Production units also generally adopt the method of narrowing ridges and increasing rows to increase plant density. In the main sugar beet producing areas of Hulan and Keshan, the ridge width is generally changed from two chi to one chi five cun to one chi eight cun, and the sowing amount is correspondingly increased from 1.8 jin to 2 jin per mu. Inspection shows that sugar beet fields with narrowed ridges and dense planting have more than 4,000 seedlings per mu.

Currently, the early-sown sugar beets have grown one to two pairs of true leaves and are growing vigorously. The masses' evaluation of this year's sugar beets is: early sowing, fine sowing, good soil, even and strong seedlings. Now, vegetable farmers in various places are processing and managing the emerged sugar beets, conducting seedling checks, replanting, watering, pest control, and hoeing to promote rapid seedling growth. Baoquan People's Commune in Keshan County has compacted the initially dry land during field management and has also begun watering and hoeing the early-sown seedling areas.

The leading departments in the sugar beet producing areas of Heilongjiang Province, in view of the early sowing, high temperature, and rapid growth of sugar beets this year, have promptly put forward the main tasks for the next stage of sugar beet production: focusing on seedling preservation, doing a good job in seedling checking, replanting, and thinning, timely cultivating, weeding, and earthing up, and preparing sufficient topdressing for sugar beets.

This newspaper reports that according to statistics up to May 20, Fujian Province has planted 420,000 mu of sugarcane, an increase of 15% compared to last year. Among them, newly planted sugarcane accounts for more than 212,000 mu, stubble sugarcane accounts for 190,000 mu, and autumn-planted sugarcane accounts for more than 16,000 mu. Currently, most of the sugarcane is growing neatly and vigorously.

The planting quality of sugarcane this year has improved compared to last year. The planting area of ​​improved varieties such as "Taiwan Sugar 134" accounts for about 70% of the total area, more than double that of last year, of which the improved varieties area in the eight main producing counties and cities such as Xianyou, Yunxiao, Longxi, Pinghe, and Quanzhou reaches more than 90%. Dense planting of sugarcane fields has also been fully implemented. The planting density of each production unit has been appropriately increased compared to last year. Most sugarcane fields have a sowing amount of 4,500 to 5,000 double-bud seedlings per mu, an increase of 500 to 1,000 compared to last year. Although there were continuous overcast and rainy days here after the "Beginning of Spring" this year, sugarcane farmers in various places still tried every means to actively resist rain and rush to plant. Most areas planted heavily between "Rain Water" and "Awakening of Insects" and ended before the "Spring Equinox," achieving timely sowing. In terms of seedling treatment, in addition to paying attention to seedling selection, various places also carried out soaking seeds in lime water and urine water.

This year, base fertilizer has also been generally applied to sugarcane fields here. Generally, 40 to 50 dan of local miscellaneous fertilizer or 15 to 20 dan of refined fertilizer are used per mu, and more than half of the sugarcane fields are intercropped with leguminous green manure, which increases the fertilizer source of the sugarcane fields. Most stubble sugarcane fields have also been promptly ridged, loosened, and base fertilizer applied.

In order to ensure a large increase in sugarcane production this year, various producing areas here are carrying out intensive field management. After planting 80,938 mu of sugarcane in Xianyou County, each commune and production team organized professional teams, established a field management responsibility system, and launched a movement combining professional teams and the masses to check seedlings, replant, cultivate, weed, irrigate, drain, and eliminate diseases and insect pests. The more than 21,900 mu of sugarcane planted in Yunxiao County this year have grown vigorously and lushly due to the strengthening of field management. The Xiaoban Brigade, which is famous in Yunxiao County for its high sugarcane yield, has more than 600 mu of sugarcane planted this year that is about two to three chi tall, with thick stalks and green leaves, no weeds, no diseases or insect pests, and about 11,000 seedlings per mu.

    黑龙江播种甜菜又早又快
    福建超额完成甘蔗种植计划
    本报讯　黑龙江省甜菜产区的人民公社，趁地湿墒足，继续突击播种甜菜。截至5月26日，全省已播种甜菜一百八十七万亩，占计划的91％，按照当前播种进度，预计6月初可全部种完。
    今年春耕播种期间，该省气温较高，雨水也多，因而甜菜的播种工作，较往年动手早，进度快。许
  多地区在4月中旬就开始了甜菜的播种。克东县由于党政领导重视，群众干劲足，全县五十二万亩甜菜，自4月15日至5月4日，仅十几天的时间，就超额完成了国家分配的种植任务。
    为了取得更大丰收，各生产单位都选用了肥地和好茬来播种甜菜。全省70％的甜菜，大都是经过秋翻或深耕的地块，其中播种在小麦、大豆、土豆等肥沃茬口上的约占65％。每亩还施入底肥四千到五千斤。各生产单位还普遍采用缩垅增行的办法，增加植株的密度。呼兰、克山主要甜菜产地，一般把垅宽二尺改为一尺五寸到一尺八寸，并相应的增加了播种量，由过去每亩一点八斤增加到二斤。经检查，缩垅密植的甜菜地，每亩保苗四千株以上。
    目前早种的甜菜，已生出一至二对真叶，生育健壮良好。群众对今年的甜菜评语是：种的早，播的细，土头好，苗齐苗壮。现各地菜农，正在加工管理已出苗的甜菜，进行查苗、补苗、浇水、治虫和铲趟，促使幼苗迅速生长。克山县宝泉人民公社，在田间管理中镇压了初见干旱的地，同时开始对早播出苗的地段浇水、铲趟。
    黑龙江省甜菜产区的领导部门，针对今年甜菜播种早、气温高、生长快的情况，已经及时地提出了下一阶段甜菜生产的主要工作任务：以保苗为纲，做好查苗、补苗和间苗，适时中耕、除草、培土，为甜菜准备足够的追肥。
    本报讯　到5月20日的统计，福建省已种植甘蔗四十二万亩，比去年扩大15％。其中新植蔗约二十一万二千多亩，宿根蔗十九万亩，秋植蔗一万六千多亩。目前绝大部分甘蔗长得整齐健壮。
    今年甘蔗种植质量比去年有了提高，“台糖134”等良种种植面积占总面积的70％左右，比去年扩大一倍以上，其中仙游、云霄、龙溪、平和、泉州等八个主产县、市良种面积达90％以上。蔗田密植也已全面推开。各生产单位的种植密度较去年有了适当提高，大部蔗田每亩放种量在四千五百到五千段双芽苗，比去年增加五百到一千段。今年“立春”后这里虽然阴雨连绵，但各地蔗农还是想尽办法，积极抗雨抢种，大部分地区都在“雨水”、“惊蛰”间大种，“春分”前结束，做到了适时下种。在种苗处理方面，各地除了注意种苗的选择以外，还进行了石灰水、尿水浸种。
    今年这里的蔗田还普遍施用了基肥，一般每亩用土杂肥四十到五十担或精肥十五到二十担，而且有半数以上的蔗田套种了豆科绿肥，增加了蔗田的肥料来源。宿根蔗田大部分也及时进行了开畦松兜和施用基肥。
    为了保证今年甘蔗大增产，这里各产区正在紧张进行田间管理。仙游县种下八万零九百三十八亩甘蔗后，各个公社生产队组织了专业队，建立田间管理责任制，开展专业队与群众性相结合的查苗、补苗、中耕除草、灌排水、除病虫害运动。云霄县今年种植的二万一千九百多亩甘蔗，由于田间管理工作的加强，蔗苗长得茁壮浓绿。以甘蔗丰产闻名云霄县的下坂大队，今年种植的六百多亩甘蔗已苗高两、三尺左右，株粗叶绿，没有杂草，没有病虫害，每亩都在一万一千苗左右。
