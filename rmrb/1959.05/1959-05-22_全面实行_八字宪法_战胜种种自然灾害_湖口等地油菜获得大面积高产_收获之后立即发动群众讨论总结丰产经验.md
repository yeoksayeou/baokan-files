(Our newspaper, Nanchang, 20th) Hukou County, a famous rapeseed producing area in Jiangxi, has achieved unprecedented large-scale high yields of rapeseed this year. The county's 377 high-yield rapeseed ridges and 284 high-yield rapeseed slopes, totaling 10,189 mu, have been harvested and threshed, with an average yield of 132 jin per mu. Among them, 3,437 mu have a unit area yield of 150 to 200 jin, 231 mu have 200 to 250 jin, and 37 mu have 300 to 500 jin.

Striving for large-scale high yields is an important measure taken by Hukou County to strive for a bumper rapeseed harvest this year. Last winter, the county launched a mass movement to cultivate large-scale, high-yield rapeseed fields, which played a significant role in ensuring this year's bumper rapeseed harvest.

After preliminary discussion and summary, the leading departments of Hukou County and the cadres and members of various communes believe that the main reasons for the large-scale high yield of rapeseed this year are: resolutely acting in accordance with the "Eight-Character Constitution" for agriculture and waging unremitting struggles against natural disasters.

In October last year, just after the "Cold Dew" solar term, rapeseed sowing began in full swing. Although there were difficulties due to insufficient labor at the time, the sowing task was completed on time, with quality, and in quantity due to the full play of the masses' enthusiasm. More than 10,000 mu of high-yield fields generally achieved: deep ditches and high ridges, ridges five feet wide, with waist ditches and side ditches connected; rational close planting with strip and spot sowing, reaching more than 100,000 plants per mu; deep plowing and rational fertilization, of which 10% of the fields were deeply plowed to one foot to one foot five inches, and the general deep plowing was six to eight inches. Each mu was combined with seed mixing and applied with 80 dan of fire manure fertilizer, six times more than in the past. These laid a good foundation for this year's large-scale bumper rapeseed harvest.

After the sowing task was completed, all communes in the county carried out meticulous rapeseed field management work on high-yield ridges and slopes. During the entire rapeseed growth period, the county organized three upsurges of field management, universally carried out three weeding sessions and three topdressing sessions. During the winter frost period, all the fields were "clothed and covered," and 20 to 30 dan of water manure, pond mud, fire manure, cattle manure, and plant ash were applied per mu to prevent freezing and keep the rapeseed warm through the winter.

Thinning and setting seedlings is an important part of rapeseed field management. All the high-yield experimental fields in Hukou County switched to hand-thinning, which was both meticulous and effective. The 25 mu rapeseed high-yield slope of the Patriotic Brigade of the Victory People's Commune, after being hand-thinned, fully achieved the requirements of thinning weak seedlings and leaving strong seedlings, thinning yellow seedlings and leaving green seedlings, and thinning short seedlings and leaving long seedlings. In March this year, the county broke the old convention of "applying fertilizer during the flowering period is a waste of effort" and launched a major campaign of topdressing rapeseed during the flowering period, applying 10 to 15 dan of manure or 20 jin of ammonium sulfate and other quick-acting fertilizers per mu.

Another important experience for Hukou County in achieving large-scale high yields of rapeseed this year is to carry forward the heroic spirit of "man can conquer nature" and unremittingly fight against natural disasters. From the sowing of rapeseed last year to the harvest, the county suffered from drought, floods, frost, and two serious insect plagues. The Hukou County Committee of the Communist Party of China led the people of the county to work hard and finally overcame these disasters, ensuring this year's large-scale bumper rapeseed harvest.

(Our newspaper, Huangyan, 20th) The Fengchanpian Production Team of the Luqiao People's Commune in Huangyan County, Zhejiang Province, has achieved a large-scale bumper harvest of rapeseed. At present, all 227 mu of rapeseed planted in this contiguous area have been harvested. As of May 18, 86% of the rapeseed has been dried, winnowed, and sold to the state, and a small amount of rapeseed that was not dry due to rain has also been weighed and converted. After the Huangyan County Committee Working Group inspected and measured the area, the entire production team harvested more than 48,000 jin of rapeseed, with an average yield of 215 jin per mu, an increase of more than one and a half times compared to last year's yield of 76 jin per mu.

Recently, the cadres, technicians, and members of the Fengchanpian Production Team, with the help of the County Committee Working Group, launched a discussion and initially summarized the experience of large-scale high yields of rapeseed. Everyone believes that the main technical measures are the following:

Deep Plowing and Wide Ridges: This rapeseed was generally deep-plowed to eight inches using tractors, about twice as deep as in the past. At the same time as deep plowing, the ridge surface should be appropriately widened (this rapeseed generally has a ridge width of nine feet), and the field ditches should be narrowed and deepened, which is conducive to drainage and irrigation, and also improves land use efficiency.

Timely Sowing: This rapeseed was sown with Ningbo seeds, which have the advantages of thick stalks, many branches, and large grains, and are early-maturing. Last year, more than 80% were sown in late November. Experience has proven that Ningbo seeds are suitable for direct sowing at the right time, and early sowing and transplanting of seedlings are prone to diseases and insect pests. According to a comparative test on the same hill of rapeseed in the Third Production Team, the average disease rate of seedlings sown on September 17 and transplanted on November 12 was 25% for virus disease, 12% for dragon head disease, and 5.6% for sclerotinia; while the disease rate of seedlings directly sown on November 24 was 9% for virus disease, 1.5% for dragon head disease, and 1% for sclerotinia.

Rational Close Planting: This rapeseed was directly sown with a specification of 4×5 inches, reaching about 20,000 plants per mu. According to the growth experience of this rapeseed, excessive density or sparseness is not appropriate. Excessive density is prone to diseases and insect pests, thin and weak stems, few branches, and easy lodging.

Master the fertilization method of heavy at both ends and light in the middle. Applying sufficient base fertilizer, multiple topdressings, and heavy applications of moss fertilizer and flower fertilizer are also the main experiences of large-scale bumper harvests of rapeseed in this area. This rapeseed applied an average of 10 jin of bone meal, 30 jin of cake fertilizer, and 5 dan of human manure per mu as base fertilizer. During the rapeseed growth period, fertilizer was applied seven times, and 6 jin of fertilizer field powder was applied to supplement poor seedlings. During the entire fertilization process, attention was paid to applying fertilizer according to the seedlings, applying more fertilizer to poor seedlings and less fertilizer to good seedlings, so that the seedlings grew evenly. The members here have the fertilization experience of "apply fertilizer to wheat seedlings and rapeseed flowers," and they attach great importance to applying flower fertilizer, applying 15 to 20 jin of fertilizer field powder per mu. Therefore, this year, this rapeseed is full of pods from bottom to top.

    全面实行“八字宪法”　战胜种种自然灾害
    湖口等地油菜获得大面积高产
    收获之后立即发动群众讨论总结丰产经验
    本报南昌20日电　江西著名油菜产地湖口县，今年油菜获得空前未有的大面积高产，全县三百七十七个油菜丰产垅和二百八十四个油菜丰产坂，共计面积一万零一百八十九亩，经过实收实打，平均亩产油菜达到一百三十二斤，其中单位面积产量在一百五十至二百斤的有三千四百三十七亩，二百斤至二百五十斤的有二百三十一亩，三百斤以上至五百斤的有三十七亩。
    力争大面积高产，是湖口县争取今年油菜大丰收所采取的重要措施。这个县在去年冬天掀起了一个群众性的培育大面积油菜高额丰产田运动，这对保证今年油菜大丰收起了重大的作用。
    湖口县领导部门和各社干部、社员经过初步讨论总结，认为今年油菜大面积高产的主要原因是：坚决按照农业“八字宪法”办事，并同自然灾害进行了不懈的斗争。
    去年10月，“寒露”刚过，油菜全面开始播种，当时虽然碰到劳力不足的困难，由于充分发挥了群众的干劲，仍然按时、按质、按量地完成了播种任务。一万多亩高产田，普遍做到：深沟高畦，畦宽五尺，腰沟、边沟沟沟相通；条播、点播合理密植，每亩达十万株以上；深耕、合理施肥，其中10％的田深耕了一尺至一尺五寸，一般的深耕了六至八寸，每亩并结合拌种下了火粪肥八十担，比以往增加六倍。这些都为今年油菜大面积丰收打下了良好基础。
    播种任务完成后，全县各公社对丰产垅丰产坂开展了细致的油菜田间管理工作。在整个油菜生长期间，全县组织了三次田间管理高潮普遍进行了三次锄草，三次追肥。在冬季霜冻期，丘丘田都进行了“穿衣盖被”，每亩加施了水粪、塘泥、火粪、牛栏粪和草木灰等二十到三十担，防冻保温，保护油菜过冬。
    间苗定苗是油菜田间管理的重要一环，湖口县所有的高产试验田都改用手间苗，又细又好。胜利人民公社爱国大队二十五亩油菜丰产坂，经过用手间苗，全部做到了间瘦苗留壮苗、间黄苗留青苗、间短苗留长苗的要求。今年3月，全县又打破了“花期追肥白花力气”的陈规，开展了一次大闹油菜花期追肥，每亩田追了十到十五担大粪或二十斤硫酸铵等速效肥料。
    湖口县取得今年油菜大面积高产的另一个重要经验，就是发扬了“人定胜天”的英雄气概不懈地向自然灾害进行了斗争。从去年油菜播种起到收割，全县曾遭受到旱、涝、霜冻和两次严重的虫灾。中共湖口县委领导全县人民艰苦奋斗，终于战胜了这些灾害，确保了今年油菜大面积丰收。　　　（宋培基）
    本报黄岩20日电　浙江省黄岩县路桥人民公社丰产片生产队，获得了油菜大面积丰收。目前这个连片种植的二百二十七亩油菜，已全部收割完毕，到5月18日止，已有86％的菜子晒干扬净卖给国家，少数菜籽因天雨没干，也全部过秤折算。经中共黄岩县委工作组验收和丈量了面积，全生产队共收菜籽四万八千多斤，平均亩产二百一十五斤，比去年亩产七十六斤增产一倍半还多。
    最近，丰产片生产队干部、技术员和社员在县委工作组帮助下展开讨论，初步总结了油菜大面积丰产经验。大家认为，在技术措施方面主要有下面几点经验：
    深耕宽畦：这片油菜使用拖拉机普遍深翻八寸，比过去增深约一倍。在深耕同时，应适当放宽畦面（这片油菜一般畦宽九尺），缩小和加深田沟，这样既有利排水和灌溉，也提高了土地使用效率。适期播种：这片油菜播种的是宁波种子，具有秆粗、枝多、粒大的优点，并有早熟的特点。去年80％以上在11月下旬播种。经验证明，宁波种以适时直播为宜，过早播种育苗移栽的易发生病虫害，根据第三生产小队同一丘油菜对比试验，9月17日播种，11月12日移栽的，平均毒素病25％，龙头病12％，菌核病5.6％；而11月24日直播的，毒素病9％，龙头病1.5％，菌核病1％。
    合理密植：这片油菜直播采用4×5寸的规格，每亩达两万株左右。根据这片油菜的生长经验，过密过稀均非所宜，过密容易发生病虫害，茎秆细弱，分枝也少，且易倒伏。
    掌握两头重、中间轻的施肥方法。施足基肥，多次追肥，重施苔肥和花肥也是这片油菜大面积丰收的主要经验。这片油菜基肥平均每亩施骨粉十斤，饼肥三十斤，人粪尿五担。油菜生长期间，分施肥料七次，对差苗补施肥田粉六斤。整个施肥过程中并注意看苗施肥，差苗多施，好苗少施，使苗长得整齐均匀。这里社员有“麦施苗、菜施花”的施肥经验，很重视施花肥，每亩施肥田粉十五到二十斤。因此今年这片油菜从下到顶都荚荚饱满。
