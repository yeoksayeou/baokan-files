    Giving Play to the Role of Literature in Communist Construction
    Soviet Writers' Congress Grandly Opens
    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 18th: The Third Soviet Writers' Congress grandly opened in the Grand Kremlin Palace in Moscow on May 18th.
    At twelve noon, more than five hundred representatives from various Soviet republics and autonomous republics, along with foreign guests from forty countries invited to participate in the congress, entered the Kremlin conference hall.
    Leaders of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, including Aristov, Brezhnev, Ignatov, Kirichenko, Kozlov, Kuusinen, Mikoyan, Mukhitdinov, Suslov, Furtseva, Khrushchev, Shvernik, and others, attended today's meeting. When they appeared in the venue, sustained applause resounded throughout the hall.
    The famous Soviet writer Fedin delivered the opening speech. He said that the Soviet Writers' Congress is a congress of revolutionary writers, and Soviet writers come from the people and serve the interests of the people. Since the Second Writers' Congress, Soviet literature has made great progress. Comrade Khrushchev's speech on the development of Soviet literature and art has further clarified the principles of the Party spirit and the people's spirit of literature for Soviet literary workers. The 21st Extraordinary Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union opened a new era of communist construction for the Soviet people. The task now facing Soviet writers is how to reflect the heroic labor of the Soviet people in communist construction, and how to educate the people with the communist spirit. Finally, on behalf of the congress, he welcomed foreign guests from socialist countries and other countries. At this point, thunderous applause broke out in the venue.
    Based on the suggestion of the writer Tikhonov, the congress unanimously elected the Presidium of the CPSU Central Committee as the honorary presidium of the congress. Subsequently, the secretariat of the congress, the credentials committee, and the editorial committee were elected, and the following agenda was adopted:
    1. Report on "The Tasks of Soviet Literature in Communist Construction" (reporter: Surkov),
    2. Report on the work of the Supervisory Committee (reporter: Lebedinsky),
    3. Report on the revision of the constitution (reporter: Markov),
    4. Re-election of leading bodies.
    Subsequently, Surkov, the First Secretary of the Board of the Soviet Writers' Union, delivered a report on "The Tasks of Soviet Literature in Communist Construction" at the meeting.

    Note: The First Soviet Writers' Congress was held in August 1934. The great writer Gorky presided over that meeting. That congress was an important stage in the development of multi-ethnic Soviet literature. Five hundred and ninety-seven writers (representatives) from fifty-two fraternal nationalities of the Soviet Union participated in the congress, as well as forty-two progressive writers from Western Europe, China, and Japan. The congress passed the charter of the Soviet Writers' Union, established the Soviet Writers' Union, and Gorky was elected as the first chairman of the Soviet Writers' Union. At that time, the Soviet Writers' Union had 1,500 members.
    At the congress, Comrade Zhdanov delivered a speech on behalf of the Central Committee of the Party, giving a high appraisal of Soviet literature. The charter of the Soviet Writers' Union passed by the congress gave a clear definition of socialist realism. The charter stated: "Socialist realism, as the basic method of Soviet literature and Soviet literary criticism, requires artists to depict reality truthfully, historically, and concretely from the revolutionary development of reality. At the same time, the truthfulness and historical concreteness of artistic depiction must be combined with the task of ideologically transforming and educating the working people in the socialist spirit."
    The Second Soviet Writers' Congress was held from December 15th to 26th, 1954. This congress was conducted under the sign of further unity in the Soviet literary community.
    This congress summarized the rich experience accumulated by Soviet literature since the First Congress, discussed some of the most important issues of socialist realism, and determined the tasks and development prospects of Soviet literature. The congress also closely united all writers of multi-ethnic literature around the Party, and promoted the consolidation of the friendly ties between Soviet literature and progressive literature around the world.
    The congress conducted extensive and full discussions, and passed a resolution on Surkov's report "On the Current Situation and Tasks of Soviet Literature" and seven other relevant supplementary reports. The meeting also passed a resolution on Tikhonov's report "On Modern Progressive Literature in the World."
    The congress also passed the new constitution of the Soviet Writers' Union. The Soviet Writers' Union was re-elected, and Surkov was elected as the First Secretary of the Board of the Soviet Writers' Union.
    Seven hundred and thirty-eight delegates participated in this congress, representing three thousand six hundred and ninety-five Soviet writers. Seventy foreign writers representing thirty-four countries were also invited to attend the congress.
