Xinhua News Agency, 12th. The sending competition in the radio transmitting and receiving event at the Second Sports Meet of the Chinese People's Liberation Army concluded today. Fourteen international and national sending records were broken in thirteen instances. A total of twenty person-times broke records. The Shenyang Military Region won the overall sending score championship, with the Nanjing Military Region as runner-up. Wu Liqing, a young athlete who broke three international and national records, won the individual sending championship. Han Haoye, a Korean soldier who joined the army last year, won the individual sending runner-up.

The radio sending finals were held on the afternoon of May 9th and 11th. One hundred and fifty male and female athletes participated in this intense competition. As a result, Wu Liqing, a contestant from the Nanjing Military Region, broke his own international record of 131.4 characters per minute for automatic key long code sending, which he set in the International Radio Rapid Sending and Receiving Friendship Competition in November 1958, with a top score of 170.6 characters per minute. Han Haoye (140.4 characters per minute) and Wang Jinwu (133.4 characters per minute) also broke this record. Ge Qiao, Sun Kuiliang, from the Nanjing Military Region, and Xu Ruifu, from the Air Force, also broke the international competition record of 94.8 characters per minute held by North Korean athlete Park Hong-bin in the men's manual key long code sending competition, with scores of 99.4 characters per minute, 98.2 characters per minute, and 97.4 characters per minute respectively. Han Haoye from the Shenyang Military Region with a score of 176.8 characters per minute and Wu Liqing from the Nanjing Military Region with a score of 167 characters per minute, also broke the automatic key character code record of 162 characters per minute set by Czechoslovakian athlete Moracik at the Second International Radio Rapid Sending and Receiving Friendship Competition held in Czechoslovakia in November 1956. At the same time, Xu Ruifu, from the Air Force, also broke the manual key character code international competition record of 137 characters per minute held by Korean athlete Xu Jicheng, with a score of 137.8 characters per minute.

In the women's automatic key long code sending competition, Zhang Jinhua, from the General Headquarters directly subordinate team of the PLA, with a score of 135 characters per minute, and Zhang Guomei, from the Nanjing Military Region, with a score of 121 characters per minute, surpassed the international record of 108.6 characters per minute set by Chinese athlete Wei Shixian at the International Radio Rapid Sending and Receiving Friendship Competition last November; Cao Qingyun, from the Kunming Military Region, broke the international competition record of 95.8 characters per minute for manual key long code sending held by Korean athlete An Mingzi with a score of 97 characters per minute; Zhang Guomei, from the Nanjing Military Region, broke the international record of 143.4 characters per minute for automatic key character code sending held by Chinese athlete Wei Shixian with a score of 156.6 characters per minute.

In the short code sending competition (no such event in international competitions), four men (using automatic keys) broke the national record of 135.2 characters per minute set by Chinese athlete Xiao Bingyan in the 1958 National Radio Sending and Receiving Competition. Their scores were: Han Haoye 212.4 characters per minute (equivalent to 169.92 characters per minute using manual key, same below); Wu Liqing 199.6 characters per minute (equivalent to 159.68 characters per minute); Sun Liqun 177.2 characters per minute (equivalent to 141.76 characters per minute); Wang Zhaoqing 171.6 characters per minute (equivalent to 137.28 characters per minute). In the women's competition in this event, three people broke the national record of 114.4 characters per minute set by Cao Qingyun in the 1957 National Radio Rapid Sending and Receiving Competition. Their scores were: Zhang Jinhua 176 characters per minute (equivalent to 140.8 characters per minute); Cao Qingyun 125.4 characters per minute (using manual key); Zhang Guomei 154.6 characters per minute (equivalent to 123.68 characters per minute).

Xinhua News Agency, 12th. The military practical event of the Second Sports Meet of the Chinese People's Liberation Army concluded today after five days of intense competition. The Beijing Military Region team won first place in the group competition with an excellent score of 43313 points. Ten athletes broke the records of the military practical events at the First International Friendly Armies Games held in Leipzig in 1958. Among them, Ren Cijian, an athlete from the Kunming Military Region, achieved the best result, scoring a total of 2648 points, which is 322 points more than the total of 2326 points (converted according to the scoring method of this conference) created by Chinese athlete Han Guishan at the First International Friendly Armies Games.

The military practical event is a new event at this All-Army Games, and also a central event to inspect the combat technical level of athletes. Each military region representative team is composed of twenty-four physically strong and militarily well-trained young officers and soldiers. They must, in the shortest possible time, first pass through an obstacle course of 200 meters in length, consisting of many dangerous and complex obstacles such as barbed wire, single-log bridges, wooden fences, board obstacles, low walls, and trenches, with a gun, and then throw grenades at a distance of 30 meters (three throws per person, full score of 24 rings), and finally conduct small-caliber rifle shooting (100 meters distance, ten shots, full score of 100 rings).

The military practical event first became an international competition event at the First International Friendly Armies Games held in Leipzig in 1958. At that time, Chinese athlete Han Guishan won first place with a total score of 2326 points.

Ren Cijian is a squad leader of a certain artillery unit of the Kunming Military Region, and is twenty-one years old this year. The reason why he was able to create the highest score in the military practical event this time is the result of his long-term adherence to comprehensive physical exercise for many years. He is not only a master of this sport, but also a second-level lightweight weightlifter and an all-around gunner. He said that his purpose in adhering to physical exercise and striving to create good results is not for personal trophies, but to defend the motherland, so he always has inexhaustible strength.

    解放军运动会不断出现好成绩

    新华社12日讯  中国人民解放军第二届体育运动大会今天结束了无线电收发报竞赛中的发报比赛。十四个国际和全国的发报纪录被突破了十三项。突破纪录的共有二十人次。沈阳部队获得发报总分冠军，南京部队为亚军。连破三项国际和全国纪录的青年选手吴立清获得个人发报冠军。去年刚入伍的朝鲜族战士韩浩野获得个人发报亚军。
    无线电发报决赛在5月9日下午和11日举行。一百五十名男女运动员参加了这场紧张激烈的竞赛。结果，南京部队选手吴立清以分速一七○·六码的最高成绩，打破他自己在1958年11月国际无线电快速收发报友谊竞赛中所创造的分速一三一·四码自动键长码发报的国际纪录。同时打破此项纪录的还有韩浩野（分速一四○·四码）和王金武（分速一三三·四码）。南京部队选手葛桥、孙奎良和空军选手徐瑞甫，在男子手键长码发报比赛中，也分别以分速九九·四码，九八·二码和九七·四码的成绩，打破了朝鲜民主主义人民共和国运动员朴弘彬保持的分速九四·八码的国际竞赛纪录。沈阳部队选手韩浩野以分速一七六·八码的成绩，南京部队选手吴立清以分速一六七码的成绩，还突破了1956年11月在捷克斯洛伐克人民共和国举行的第二届国际无线电快速收发报友谊竞赛中捷克斯洛伐克运动员莫拉齐克创造的分速一六二码的自动键字码的纪录。同时，空军选手徐瑞甫，也以分速一三七·八码的成绩，突破了朝鲜运动员许极成保持的分速一三七码的手键字码国际竞赛纪录。
    女子自动键长码发报竞赛，解放军总直属队选手张锦华以分速一三五码和南京部队张国美以分速一二一码的成绩超过了我国运动员魏诗娴在去年11月国际无线电快速收发报友谊竞赛中创造的分速一○八·六码的国际纪录；昆明部队选手曹庆云以分速九七码的成绩打破了朝鲜运动员安明子保持的分速九五·八码手键长码发报的国际竞赛纪录；南京部队选手张国美以分速一五六·六码的成绩打破了我国运动员魏诗娴保持自动键字码拍发的分速一四三·四的国际竞赛纪录。
    在短码发报竞赛中（国际竞赛无此项目），男子四人（用自动键拍发）打破了我国运动员萧炳炎在1958年全国无线电收发报竞赛中创造的分速一三五·二码的全国最高纪录。他们的成绩是：韩浩野分速二一二·四码（折合手键一六九·九二码，下同）；吴立清分速一九九·六码（折合一五九·六八码）；孙立群分速一七七·二码（折合一四一·七六码）；王兆清分速一七一·六码（折合一三七·二八码）。在这个项目的女子比赛中，有三人打破了曹庆云在1957年全国无线电快速收发报竞赛中创造的分速一一四·四码的全国最高纪录。她们的成绩是：张锦华分速一七六码（折合一四○·八码）；曹庆云分速一二五·四码（用手键拍发）；张国美分速一五四·六码（折合一二三·六八码）。
    新华社12日讯  中国人民解放军第二届体育运动大会军事实用项目经过五天的激烈比赛已于今天结束。北京部队代表队以总分四三三一三的优异成绩，获得团体第一名。有十名选手连破1958年在来比锡举行的第一届国际友军运动会上军事实用项目的纪录。其中昆明部队运动员任赐渐成绩最好，得总分二六四八，比在第一届国际友军运动会上我国运动员韩贵山创造的（按这次大会计分方法折算）总分二三二六多三二二分。
    军事实用项目是这次全军运动会上的一个新项目，也是检阅运动员战斗技术水平的一个中心项目。每个部队代表队由二十四名体格健壮和军事训练成绩最优秀的年轻官兵组成。他们要在尽可能短的时间内，首先带枪通过由铁丝网、独木桥、木栅、板障、矮墙、堑壕等许多险要复杂的障碍物组成的全程二百公尺长的障碍地带，然后在三十公尺的距离上投掷手榴弹（每人投三次，满分二十四环），最后进行小口径步枪射击（一百公尺距离，射击十发，满分一百环）。
    军事实用项目第一次成为国际比赛项目是1958年在来比锡举行的第一届国际友军运动会上。那时，我国运动员韩贵山以二三二六总分获得第一名。
    任赐渐是昆明部队某炮兵部队的班长，今年二十一岁。这次所以能够创造军事实用项目的最高成绩，是他数年如一日地长期坚持全面体育锻炼的结果。他不但是这项运动的能手，而且还是轻量级举重二级运动员和全能炮手。他说，他坚持体育锻炼，努力创造好成绩的目的，不是为了个人锦标，而是为了保卫祖国，所以，他一直有使用不完的力量。
