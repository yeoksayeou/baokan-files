    Ode to May Day
    Xu Chi
    Ten years ago on May Day, the rape flowers were yellow,
    The People's Liberation Army crossed the Yangtze River; this year on May Day, the highland barley is green,
    Golden light shines on Tibet. Ten years, Tiananmen Square has been renovated,
    Ten years, the Republic has changed: although the buildings are not yet completed,
    They are magnificent, majestic, and have taken shape. On this joyous May Day holiday,
    The masses gather in teams in the square, after the national anthem, the Internationale is played,
    The May songs are like an ocean. Youth come holding fresh flowers,
    Strong men raise their heads full of spirit; the voices of the youth are the clearest,
    The sound of "Long Live" shakes the sky. The ranks of workers and peasants are gradually merging,
    Intellectual and manual labor go hand in hand. Ambitions soar into the clouds,
    The leaping horses and dragons fly together. The singing is bright in front of Tiananmen,
    The sleeves dance long on Chang'an Avenue. Chairman Mao raises his hand to greet us,
    Chairman Liu smiles and claps his hands again.

    五一颂歌
    徐迟十年前五一菜花黄，
    解放大军渡长江；今年五一青稞青，
    一片金光照西藏。十年，天安门翻了新，
    十年，共和国变了样：建筑虽然未完成，
    华丽、雄壮有形象。五一欢庆佳节日，
    群众结队来广场，奏罢国歌奏国际歌，
    五月歌声如海洋。青春手捧鲜花来，
    健儿昂首意气扬；少年嗓音最清脆，
    万岁之声震天响。工农队伍渐溶合，
    智力劳力并肩行。志气高立入云霄，
    跃进马、龙凤齐翱翔。天安门前歌声亮，
    长安街头舞袖长。毛主席举手来相招，
  刘主席含笑又击掌。
