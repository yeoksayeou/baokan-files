    "Demon Woman's" New Life
     Xinhua News Agency reporter Ge Lai

    In the Shannan region of Tibet, the story of Zha Xi, a Tibetan woman saved by the Lhasa People's Hospital, is being spread. Han doctors removed a 48-斤 (jin - approximately 24 kg or 53 lbs) tumor from her stomach, allowing this woman, who had been tormented by illness for nearly ten years, to quickly recover her health and participate in production.

    Zha Xi's home is in Jiduoxiu, by the Yarlung Zangbo River in the Shannan region. She is a diligent, intelligent, and pretty girl. With her skillful hands, she can weave exquisite Tibetan carpets and the famous Tibetan Jide embroidered skirts. Twelve years ago, she suffered from a severe ovarian cyst tumor. Because there was no way to treat it, the tumor grew larger and larger, and her abdomen swelled like a big drum. For nearly ten years, she could not go to the fields to work, and she needed help to put on her boots. When she sat down, the tumor pressed against her chest, causing pain like being stabbed with an awl. Her heartbeat became more rapid day by day, and her breathing became more and more labored. The pain robbed her of her youth. Zha Xi's family tried every means to seek help from gods and Buddhas everywhere, but they could not cure her illness. The whole family thought there was no hope. People in the village suspected that Zha Xi had been pregnant for twelve years, and some bad people and reactionary lamas viciously asserted that she was a "demon woman" and a "devil," and if she was not eliminated, the area would not be peaceful. After that, people in and out of the village would avoid her when they saw her.

    Seeing that the spring plowing and sowing season was approaching, Zha Xi's family did not even have a single seed to plant, and hunger and disaster threatened her entire family. At this time, the staff sent by Chairman Mao arrived in Shannan. Zha Xi's family received interest-free agricultural loans and living expenses from the state. The whole family was overjoyed and said, "Chairman Mao's sun shines on the snowy mountains, warming the coldest places." At this time, Zha Xi deeply felt: "Only Chairman Mao and the Communist Party care about the Tibetan working people." But because her illness had lasted too long, it was deteriorating day by day. One day, the staff of the agricultural loan team visited her home and told her that the Lhasa People's Hospital could cure her illness. Zha Xi turned from worry to joy and began to have confidence in her recovery. With the help of the staff, she traveled by carriage along the newly built Zedang to Lhasa road and arrived in Lhasa.

    The doctors at the Lhasa People's Hospital conducted a detailed examination of Zha Xi and determined that it was a difficult disease to treat. Because the tumor had grown too large, it was pressing on her chest and lungs, posing a risk of suffocation at any time. Her body was already emaciated. To remove the large tumor that had been lurking for more than ten years, there was a high possibility that Zha Xi would suffocate on the operating table. After the doctors explained the situation to her, she was unwilling to leave the hospital no matter what, thinking, "The Communist Party will surely save me." After the hospital's Party organization and administrative leaders learned about this, they personally visited her ward and instructed the doctors to do everything possible and overcome all difficulties to save her life. The responsible comrade of the hospital's Party committee said, "As long as the patient has a breath, we must save her." Doctors from many departments offered suggestions and ideas one after another, and held several meetings to specifically study the condition and the problem of the tumor removal surgery. In order to save Zha Xi's life, many Han doctors and medical staff members eagerly signed up to donate their blood to their Tibetan compatriots. Many nurses worked tirelessly to prepare for everything before the operation. In order to prevent the patient from suffocating during the operation, the doctors transfused Zha Xi with blood several times before the operation.

    On the day of the abdominal incision to remove the tumor, the operating room was silent. When the sharp tip of the knife cut open the peritoneum, a large, hard tumor covered with blood vessels was exposed. The tumor was particularly tightly attached to the abdominal wall, and even a slight movement would cause massive bleeding. The operation lasted for more than five hours. The doctors first extracted a large amount of yellow fluid from the tumor sac, and then, like lifting a heavy stone, finally removed the huge tumor. During the operation, the patient showed signs of suffocation several times, and the doctors immediately injected the patient with a large amount of saline glucose and transfused 900 cc of blood. Doctors and nurses guarded Zha Xi day and night, and prepared very good food for her.

    On the fifth day after the operation, Zha Xi was able to get out of bed and walk around. For nearly ten years, her waist had not been able to bend, but now she excitedly bent down and touched her feet with her hands.

    It is the season when mountain peach blossoms are blooming on the south bank of the Yarlung Zangbo River, and Zha Xi reappeared in the fields. Many young men and women in the village brought hadas and highland barley wine to congratulate her. Zha Xi respectfully hung the pure white hadas on Chairman Mao's portrait.

    “妖女”的新生
     新华社记者  格来
    在西藏山南地区，传颂着拉萨人民医院救活一个藏族妇女扎茜的故事，汉族医生从她的肚子里取出了一个四十八斤重的大瘤，使这个被疾病折磨了近十年的妇女很快恢复健康，参加生产。
    扎茜的家住在山南地区雅鲁藏布江边的吉多秀，她是一个勤劳智慧而又俊俏的姑娘，凭着灵巧的双手，能织出精美的藏毯和西藏著名的吉德绣花裙子。十二年前，她患了严重的卵巢囊肿瘤症，因为没有办法治疗，后来肿瘤越长越大，腹部胀得像一个大鼓一样。近十年来，她不能下地劳动，穿靴子都要别人帮助，坐着的时候，肿瘤顶住胸部，像锥子扎一样痛，心跳得一天比一天厉害，气喘得一天比一天剧烈。病痛夺去了她的青春。扎茜家里想尽办法，到处求神拜佛，但怎么也治不好她的病，全家人都认为没有希望了。村子里的人怀疑扎茜怀了十二年的孕，有些坏人和反动喇嘛恶毒地一口咬定说她是“妖女”、“魔鬼”，如果不除掉，地方上会得不到安宁。这以后，村里村外的人见了她就远远躲开。
    眼看就要春耕播种了，扎茜家连一颗下地的种籽都没有，饥饿、灾难威胁着她的全家。就在这个时候，毛主席派来的工作人员到了山南，扎茜家得到了国家发给的无息农贷和生活费用，全家人欢天喜地，说“毛主席的太阳照到了雪山上，温暖着最寒冷的地方。”这时，扎茜深深地感到：“关心藏族劳动人民的只有毛主席和共产党。”但是她的病因为时日太久，却在一天天地恶化。有一天，农贷组的工作人员到她家访问，告诉她说，拉萨人民医院可以治好她的病。扎茜转忧为喜，对自己恢复健康开始有了信心。在工作人员的帮助下，她乘坐马车沿着新修的泽当到拉萨的公路，来到了拉萨。
    拉萨人民医院的医生们为扎茜进行了详细的检查，认为是一种难治的病，因为瘤子长得太大了，压住她的胸部和肺部，随时有窒息的危险，她的身体已经瘦弱不堪，要摘除潜伏了十几年的大肿瘤，很有可能使扎茜窒息在手术台上。当医生向她说明这种情况以后，她无论怎样也不愿意离开医院，心想：“共产党一定能救活我”。医院党组织和行政的领导干部知道这件事情后，亲自到病房看她，并嘱咐医生要想尽一切办法，克服一切困难，来挽救她的生命。医院党的负责同志说：“只要病人还有一口气，我们就要挽救她”。许多科室的医生们纷纷献计献策，几次开会专门研究病情和割肿瘤的手术问题。为了挽救扎茜的生命，许多汉族医生和医务工作同志，争先报名，要把自己的鲜血输到藏族同胞的身上去。很多护理人员废寝忘食地进行手术前的一切准备工作。为了不使患者在进行手术时窒息，医生们在手术前接连几次给扎茜输了血。
    在剖腹割瘤的这天，手术室里一片寂静。锋利的刀尖，拉开腹膜时，一个又大又硬，布满血管的肿瘤露出来了。肿瘤和腹壁粘得特别紧，稍一动就会引起大出血。手术进行了五个多小时，医生们先从瘤囊中抽出大量的黄水，接着像抬一块沉重的石头一样，终于把一个巨大的肿瘤取了出来。在进行手术的时候，病人几次呈现出窒息状态，医生们立即给患者注射大量的盐水葡萄糖，输了九百西西的血。医生，护士昼夜守护着扎茜，给她准备了很好的饮食。
    动手术后的第五天，扎茜就能下床走动了，近十年来，她的腰一直不能弯下去，现在她兴奋地弯下了腰，用手去摸摸自己的脚。
    正是雅鲁藏布江南岸山桃花开的季节，扎茜重新出现在田野上。村子里的很多青年男女拿着哈达、青稞酒来向她祝贺，扎茜把一条条洁白的哈达恭恭敬敬地挂在毛主席的像上。
