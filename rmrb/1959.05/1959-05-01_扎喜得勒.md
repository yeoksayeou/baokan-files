Zhaxidele

Li Ying

After the Lhasa rebellion was quelled by our army, the Tibetan people all smiled when they met and greeted each other with "Zhaxidele" (good luck and auspiciousness)! Zhaxidele! Zhaxidele! Tibet, please accept, accept my congratulations, I want to say to everyone, say it one hundred and twenty
ten thousand times, my congratulations are a song. Hello! To each of your tents, each wisp of
smoke, each lamb, each small river; and the yak-hide boats on the water, the highland barley in the fields,
the chirping birds and the blooming mountain flowers. Yesterday you were still being exploited and extorted by those rebels, a nation was sinking in a sea of ​​blood, Tibet, you were a dry yak-hide
bag, without a single tea leaf or grain of highland barley. But we have today, Tibet! Today, you seem to concentrate more than a thousand years of sunshine
and poetry; look, how proud you are in your tears, everywhere voices laughing, golden light sparkling! Ah, isn't that you galloping on horseback? You are beginning to surpass history and move forward, the days
are red like fire. I know you stand tall on the roof of the world
to sing songs of joy to the whole world. Zhaxidele! Zhaxidele! Let me use this golden vocabulary to congratulate
you, Tibet, I see your two lips smiling, you say this sentence, how happy!

    拉萨叛乱被我军平息后，西藏人民相见均笑逐颜开，互道“扎喜得勒”（吉祥如意）！扎喜得勒！扎喜得勒！西藏，请接受，接受我的祝贺，我要向每个人说，说一百二十
  万次，我的祝贺是一只歌。你好！你们的每座帐篷，每缕
  炊烟，每只羊仔，每条小河；还有水上的牛皮船，田间的青
  稞，叫着的小鸟和山花朵朵。昨天还被那些叛徒剥削、勒索，一个民族正在血海里沉没，西藏，你是一只干燥的牛皮口
  袋，没有一片茶叶、一粒青稞。可我们有今天，西藏！今天，你仿佛集中了一千多年的阳光
  和诗歌；看呵，泪滴里你多么骄傲，到处人声笑语，金光烁烁！呵，那驱马驰骋的不是你么？你开始超越历史前进，日子通
  红像火。我知道你高高的站在世界屋脊
  上，为了要向全世界唱欢乐之歌。扎喜得勒！扎喜得勒！让我用这黄金般的语汇向你祝
  贺，西藏，我看见你两片嘴唇笑了，你说出这句话，多么快活！
