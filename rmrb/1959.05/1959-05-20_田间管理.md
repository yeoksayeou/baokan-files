    Field Management
    Crop Breeding and Cultivation Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences

    In crop cultivation, field management is an extremely complex task. The great agricultural harvest of 1958 proved the immense importance of field management, as many high-yielding lands were inseparable from strengthened field management. For example, during the wheat planting season of 1957, the Yellow River basin suffered prolonged drought, and in the spring, it was continuously harmed by spring drought, late frost, wheat stem sawfly, and rainstorms. However, Meng County, Henan, implemented "five fertilizers, seven irrigations, three hoeings, five harrowings, and two weedings" on more than 250,000 mu of winter wheat land, resolutely eliminating third-class seedlings and fiercely attacking the four barriers of drought, frost, insects, and rain, ultimately achieving a large-scale high yield of 500 jin per mu. Another example is Siyang, Jiangsu, which planted more than 200,000 mu of cotton in 1958 and achieved a large-scale bumper harvest. In addition to other yield-increasing cultivation measures, during the cotton growth period, fertilizer was applied more than six times, up to fourteen times in some cases; insect control was carried out ten to fifteen times; hoeing and weeding were done more than ten times; drought-resistant irrigation was performed twice; and fine pruning, late topping, late-stage drainage, wind prevention, and frost prevention measures were also implemented. The experience of the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production in 1958 shows that adding just 10% more effort can yield 10% more grain. Therefore, the principle of "management does not stop until the crops are harvested" should be firmly implemented.

    The Physiological Basis of Field Management

    The purpose of field management is to adjust the physiological activity processes of crops in each growth stage (such as strengthening the root system, adapting nutritional growth to the development process, strengthening photosynthesis, etc.), creating the most favorable conditions for crop growth, that is, comprehensively using various favorable factors and overcoming unfavorable factors, in order to maximize crop productivity and improve product quality. For example, to make wheat have large ears and full grains, sufficient fertilizer, water, and sunlight must be provided during the jointing stage. Therefore, topdressing and irrigation become the most important management measures during this period. To increase the sugar content of tubers or rootstocks, the transport of assimilated substances within the leaves should be strengthened, so foliar fertilization will play a certain role. To prevent crops from growing excessively, a complete fertilizer with an appropriate combination of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium should be given during the seedling stage, and the irrigation period and amount should be adjusted, and seedling control should be implemented, so that the base between the first and second nodes below the topsoil of wheat crops should not be excessively elongated, thereby reducing the risk of lodging.

    Different crops require a set of field management systems, some of which are special measures, such as artificial pollination of corn and sunflowers, fine pruning and late topping of cotton, soil cultivation, vine pressing, vine hanging and vine turning of sweet potatoes and peanuts, bud picking and flower picking of potatoes, and thinning, fixing and replanting seedlings of most cultivated crops, which will not be described in detail. This article only discusses general field management measures.

    Topdressing and Irrigation

    Rational topdressing and rational irrigation are key field management measures to achieve high yields. In particular, topdressing and irrigation should be carried out in the seedling stage to lay a solid foundation for high yields. The large-scale bumper harvest of winter wheat in Meng County, Henan in 1958 relied on fertilizer and water measures to improve third-class seedlings to first-class seedlings, and first-class seedlings to high-yield seedlings. Topdressing and irrigation are necessary conditions to ensure that crops fully exert their high-yield effect. In particular, deep plowing and close planting greatly increase the number of plants per unit area, and the root system expands the absorption range to a greater depth. Therefore, the plant's requirements for fertilizer and water are also greatly increased. If the crop's needs for fertilizer and water in each growth stage are not met in time, healthy growth and development cannot be achieved, and the highest yield cannot be obtained.

    Topdressing and irrigation are not only important in the seedling stage, but also very important in the later stage of crop growth. In 1958, the average yield of seed cotton per mu on 1,570 mu of cotton fields at the Cotton Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences was 561.51 jin, doubling the yield of 1957. Among the comprehensive yield-increasing measures, continuing to topdress during the boll stage and strengthening irrigation have significant effects on increasing boll setting rate and boll weight. According to surveys, applying fertilizer in the later stage can result in four to six more cotton bolls per plant than not applying fertilizer, and the average boll weight increases by 0.27 grams; the number of bolls set per plant with two irrigations in the later stage is 4.2 more than that without irrigation, the weight of 100 bolls increases by 80 grams, and is 1.4 more bolls than with one irrigation, and the weight of 100 bolls increases by 60 grams.

    Topdressing should follow the three major principles of staged topdressing, topdressing according to seedling conditions, and appropriate coordination of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. Topdressing should use fast-acting fertilizers so that they can be utilized by plants in a timely manner. Therefore, the amount used each time should not be too much, especially fast-acting nitrogen fertilizers. Excessive use at one time can cause seedlings to grow rapidly, tissues to become tender and weak, and easily lead to lodging. For example, each time, applying 20 to 30 jin of ammonium sulfate per mu is appropriate. At the same time, topdressing should be carried out according to the different requirements of crops for various fertilizers in each growth stage and the growth of seedlings. Grains such as rice and wheat are generally topdressed during the tillering, jointing, booting, heading, and grain filling stages. For example, wheat seedlings need phosphorus and potassium fertilizers in addition to nitrogen fertilizer to increase plant cold resistance; the tillering stage needs phosphorus fertilizer in addition to nitrogen fertilizer to make the root system develop well; the jointing stage needs all three fertilizers of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, in which nitrogen fertilizer helps to form large ears and many grains, and potassium fertilizer makes the stems strong; the booting stage also needs all three fertilizers of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, which can make the grains numerous and full, at this time phosphorus fertilizer has a great influence on nutrient conversion; the grain filling stage needs nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizers, phosphorus fertilizer can advance maturity, and nitrogen fertilizer has a great impact on the quality of seeds, and appropriate application of nitrogen fertilizer can also increase the protein content of grains.

    Topdressing according to seedling conditions is to determine the application amount of the three elements or supplement a certain trace element based on the shade of the seedling color, the presence or absence of mottled variegation, or other signs (the issue of applying trace elements is more complicated and will not be discussed further). Chen Yongkang, a rice labor model, summarized the experience of "three yellows and three blacks" in topdressing late rice according to seedling conditions, which is very valuable. The specific mastery is as follows: after fertilization in the tillering stage, the leaf color changes to green (the first "black") and fades at the end of tillering before round stem jointing (the first "yellow"); the second topdressing is applied during the Great Heat (the second "black"); when young ear differentiation begins, the leaves fade again (the second "yellow"); the third topdressing is applied after the Beginning of Autumn when entering the ear differentiation stage (the third "black"); the leaf color turns yellow again three to five days before heading (the third "yellow"). Such topdressing makes the late rice head neatly, the stem tissue is hard, and it is not easy to lodge. Conversely, if the leaf color is still dark before heading, heading will be delayed and there is a risk of lodging.

    Topdressing must be closely combined with another important field management measure, that is, rational irrigation, to more effectively utilize fertilizers.

    Irrigation can be divided into irrigation of irrigated land and irrigation of paddy fields. Irrigation, like topdressing, is generally based on the crop's water requirements in each growth stage. For example, the water consumption of potato plants varies in different growth stages. The water consumption in the early stage of bud formation is about 33% to 46% of the plant's water content at that time, 25% to 35% in the flowering stage, 10% to 17% twenty days after flowering, and 8% to 17% in the early stage of wilting. Therefore, irrigation should be carried out in a timely manner during the bud formation and flowering stages. If there is a drought during this period, it will lead to a serious reduction in yield. Another example is the application of returning green water (winter crops), jointing water, heading water, flowering water, and grain filling water to grain crops.

    According to the results of the cooperation experiment between the Crop Breeding and Cultivation Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences and the Beijing Institute of Water Conservancy Science from 1955 to 1958, winter irrigation of winter wheat can stabilize ground temperature, accumulate moisture, and allow wheat seedlings to overwinter well; the period from returning green to jointing is the period when wheat ears are formed, and sufficient soil moisture at this time can promote spikelet differentiation and have a good effect on increasing wheat ears; irrigating from heading to grain filling can make the grains full and increase yield, but the amount of water should be controlled to avoid lodging. This research result is basically consistent with the people's high-yield experience.

    The amount of irrigation water for crops other than rice should generally maintain soil moisture at 60% to 70% of the field's maximum water holding capacity. The irrigation method should follow the principles of small water, light irrigation, frequent irrigation, and ditch irrigation, and oppose the principle of large-scale flooding.

    In rainy areas, drainage and flood prevention operations in dry land are also very important, because excessive soil moisture often leads to serious boll shedding in cotton, lodging and early death of grain crops, which results in unfilled grains, and rotting or physiological "hard heart" of tuber crops. Therefore, different regions should effectively master drainage work according to soil, climate conditions, and the specific requirements of crops.

    In terms of paddy field irrigation, in order to meet the needs of close planting of rice, there has been great development in irrigation technology in recent years. In the past, paddy fields generally used the "long-term water layer irrigation method." Now some areas have proven that this irrigation method is not as good as the "shallow water, moist, and field roasting combined irrigation method." Because in the case of close planting of rice, the long-term water layer irrigation method often causes excessive humidity between plants, low soil temperature, poor root development, and affects the healthy development of rice plants and is prone to lodging. Field surveys have shown that the relative humidity between rice plants is 10% to 20% lower with shallow water moist roasted field irrigation method than with water layer irrigation method, the temperature difference between day and night is larger, the root length is four centimeters longer, and the root distribution range is 3.2 to 4.8 centimeters smaller (indicating that this irrigation method promotes the development of rice roots to a greater depth). These are beneficial to the accumulation of rice nutrients, inhibiting excessive growth, preventing lodging, and reducing diseases.

    Cultivation, Weeding, and Others

    Another general technical measure in the field management of crops is cultivation and weeding. In 1958, high-yield fields in various places paid great attention to cultivation and weeding, and some proposed the Great Leap Forward slogan of "pulling weeds when you see them, and loosening the soil when it is tight." Generally, cultivation and weeding were carried out more than three to five times, and some even up to more than ten times, which played a positive role in achieving bumper harvests. The role of cultivation is to preserve moisture, loosen the topsoil, increase soil air content, make the ground temperature easy to rise, promote fertilizer decomposition, strengthen root physiological activities, and make plant growth healthy. At the same time, cultivation also plays the role of weeding. The cultivation depth of general crops is based on the growth of plants and root systems, and the principle of gradually increasing from shallow to deep and then from deep to shallow should be followed. After fertilization, irrigation, or rainfall, the soil surface hardens. As long as it is possible to operate on the ground, time should be taken to carry out cultivation, which can both preserve moisture and promote the absorption of nutrients by the root system. For tall crops such as corn and hemp, cultivating the soil between rows on the base of the stems can prevent lodging.

    For non-cultivated crops such as wheat, if weeding is difficult in the case of close planting, herbicides can be used to kill dicotyledonous weeds. During the Great Leap Forward, the masses also made good creations in this regard. For example, Jianyang, Fujian created soil pesticide herbicides, which pointed out the direction for solving the weeding problem after close planting.

    In addition, frost prevention, freezing prevention, and wind prevention in farmland are also very important field management tasks. For example, preventing early frost can increase the proportion of pre-frost flowers in cotton, make the seeds of late-maturing grains and legumes full, and increase the sugar content of root crops. In addition to measures such as smoking, irrigation and suppression (winter wheat) also have significant effects on frost prevention. In 1953, winter wheat in North China was generally harmed by spring frost during the jointing and booting stages. Before the frost, some irrigated wheat areas took field management measures such as irrigation to prevent frost, and were not damaged; after the frost, most areas immediately took measures such as topdressing and irrigation, so that the original latent buds of the wheat plants grew rapidly, re-tillered, and normally headed and fruited, and generally still had 60% to 70% of the yield, which was much more favorable than destroying the seedlings and replanting. Therefore, correct field management measures not only have a preventive effect on certain serious natural disasters, but also have the effect of reducing damage and ensuring bumper harvests.

    田间管理
    中国农业科学院作物育种栽培研究所
    在作物栽培过程中，田间管理是一项极其复杂的工作。1958年的农业大丰收证明了田间管理的极大重要性，因为很多丰产的土地是和加强田间管理分不开的。例如1957年种麦季节，黄河流域长期干旱，春季又连续遭受春旱、晚霜、吸浆虫、暴风雨为害，但是河南孟县在二十五万多亩冬小麦地上实行了“五肥、七水、三锄、五耙、两拔草”坚决消灭三类苗，并猛攻旱、霜、虫、雨四关，最后获得亩产五百斤的大面积丰产。又如江苏泗阳1958年植棉二十多万亩获得大面积丰收，除其他增产栽培措施外，在棉花生长期间进行追肥六次以上，最多达到十四次，治虫十到十五次，中耕除草十次以上，抗旱灌溉二次，另外还进行细整枝晚打顶以及后期排涝、防风、防霜等措施。1958年农业生产大跃进的经验说明，只要多加一成工就能多收一成粮，因此，应当坚决贯彻“庄稼不收，管理不停”的原则。
    田间管理的生理基础
    田间管理的目的是在于调整作物各生育期的生理活动过程（如根系的增强，营养生长与发育过程相适应，光合作用的加强等等），给作物生育创造最优越的条件，也就是综合运用各种有利因素，克服不利因素，以便发挥作物的最大生产力，提高产品质量。例如，要使小麦穗大粒饱，就须在拔节期给予足够的肥、水和阳光，那么，追肥和灌溉就成为这一时期最重要的管理措施。为了提高块根或块茎的含醣量，应加强叶片内同化物质的转运，那么，根外追肥将起到一定的作用。为使作物免于徒长，就应当在苗期给以氮、磷、钾适当配合的完全肥料，并调节灌溉时期和灌溉量，实行蹲苗，使麦类作物在表土下面的基部一、二节间不要过分伸长，从而减轻倒伏的危险。
    不同作物各需要一套田间管理体系，其中有的是特殊的措施，如玉米、向日葵的人工辅助授粉，棉花的细整枝晚打顶，甘薯、花生的培土、压蔓、挂蔓和翻蔓，马铃薯的摘蕾、摘花，以及大部分中耕作物的间苗、定苗和补苗等，不予详述。本文仅就一般性的田间管理措施，加以讨论。
    追肥和灌溉
    合理追肥和合理灌溉是取得丰产的关键性的田间管理措施。特别要在苗期抓紧进行追肥、灌溉，给丰产打下稳固基础。1958年河南孟县取得冬小麦大面积丰产，就是依靠肥水措施，将三类苗提高为一类苗，一类苗提高为丰产苗的结果。追肥和灌溉是保证农作物充分发挥丰产效果的必要条件。特别是深耕和密植使单位面积上作物的植株数目大大增加，根系向纵深的吸收范围扩大，因此植株对肥、水的要求亦大为提高。如果不及时地供给作物生育各期对肥、水的要求，便不能达到健壮的生长和发育，获得最高产量。
    追肥和灌溉不仅在苗期重要，在作物生育后期也非常重要。中国农业科学院棉花研究所1958年一千五百七十亩棉田平均亩产籽棉五百六十一点五一斤，比1957年增产一倍。在综合性增产措施中，铃期继续追肥和加强灌溉，对增加结铃率和铃重，均有显著效果。根据调查，后期施肥比不施肥可以多结四到六个棉铃（单株），铃重平均增加零点二七克；后期灌溉两次的单株结铃数比不灌溉的多四点二个，百铃重增加八十克，比灌溉一次的增加一点四个铃，百铃重增加六十克。
    追肥应掌握分期追肥、看苗追肥和氮、磷、钾适当配合的三大原则。追肥要用速效性肥料，才能及时地为植物所利用，因此每次用量不宜过多，特别是速效性氮肥，一次用量过多，致使幼苗猛长，组织嫩弱，易于倒伏，比如每次亩施硫酸铵以二十到三十斤为宜。同时还要根据作物的生育各期对各种肥料的不同要求和幼苗的生长情况而进行追肥。稻麦等谷类作物一般按分蘖、拔节、孕穗、抽穗和灌浆各期进行追肥。例如小麦，幼苗期除需氮肥外，还需要磷、钾肥，以增加植株抗寒性；分蘖期除需氮肥外还需要磷肥，使得根系发育良好；拔节期全面需要氮、磷、钾三种肥料，其中氮肥有助于形成大穗和多粒，钾肥使茎秆坚强，孕穗期也需要氮、磷、钾三种肥料，可使子粒多而饱满，这时磷肥对养分转化的影响很大；灌浆期需氮、磷肥，磷肥可提早成熟，氮肥对种子的品质有很大影响，适当施氮肥还可增加子粒的蛋白质含量。
    看苗追肥是根据苗色的浓淡、斑纹杂色的有无或其他征象而定三要素的施用量或补充某种微量元素（关于施用微量元素问题，比较复杂，兹不多述）。水稻劳动模范陈永康在晚稻看苗追肥上曾总结出“三黄三黑”的经验，很有价值。具体掌握如下：分蘖期施肥后叶色变绿（第一次“黑”）到分蘖终期圆秆拔节前退色（第一次“黄”）；大暑第二次追肥（第二次“黑”）；到幼穗分化开始，叶又退色（第二次“黄”）；立秋后进入穗分化期第三次追肥（第三次“黑”）；到出穗前三—五天叶色又转黄（第三次“黄”）。这样追肥使晚稻出穗整齐，茎秆组织坚硬，不易倒伏，反之，如出穗前叶色仍浓，则出穗延迟、且有倒伏危险。
    追肥必须与另一重要的田间管理措施，即合理灌溉，紧密相结合，才能更有效地利用肥料。
    灌溉可以分为水浇地灌溉和水田灌溉两方面。灌溉也和追肥一样，一般是以作物的各生育期对于水分的要求为依据的。例如马铃薯植株不同生育期的消耗水量不同。孕蕾初期消耗水量约为植株当时含水量的33％到46％，开花期为25％到35％，开花后二十天为10％到17％，雕萎初期为8％到17％。因此在孕蕾开花期应及时进行灌溉，如此期干旱，将招致严重减产。又如谷类作物浇返青水（冬季作物）、拔节水、抽穗水、扬花水和灌浆水等。
    根据中国农业科学院作物育种栽培研究所与北京水利科学研究院于1955—1958年合作试验的结果，冬小麦进行冬灌能平抑地温、积蓄水分，使麦苗良好越冬；返青至拔节是小麦穗部形成时期，此时土壤水分充足能促进小穗分化，对麦穗增大起良好作用；抽穗至灌浆期灌水，能使籽粒饱满，产量增高，但应控制水量，以免引起倒伏。这一研究成果与群众的丰产经验，基本上是一致的。
    除水稻外其他作物的灌水量，一般以保持土壤水分在田间最大持水量的60％到70％为宜。浇水方法应该掌握小水轻浇、勤浇、开沟浇，反对大水漫浇的原则。
    在多雨地区，旱地排水防涝作业也非常重要，因为土壤水分过多，往往导致棉花的严重落蕾落铃，谷类作物的倒伏和早期枯死因而使籽实不饱满，薯类作物的腐烂或生理“硬心”，等等。因此，不同地区应该根据土壤、气象条件和作物的具体要求，切实掌握排水工作。
    水田灌溉方面，为了适应水稻密植的需要，近年来在灌溉技术上有很大发展。过去，水田一般都采用“长期水层灌溉法”，现在有些地区证明这种灌溉方法不如“浅水、湿润、烤田相结合的灌溉法”为优越。因为在水稻密植情况下，长期水层灌溉法往往因株间湿度太大，土壤温度低，发根不良，影响稻棵健壮发育易引起倒伏。田间调查证明，浅水湿润烤田灌溉法比水层灌溉法，稻棵间的相对湿度小10％到20％，昼夜温差较大，根的长度较长四厘米，根的分布范围小三点二到四点八厘米（说明这种灌溉法促使稻根向纵深发展）。这些，对水稻营养物质的积累，抑制徒长，防止倒伏，减轻病害，都是有利的。
    中耕除草及其他
    作物的田间管理工作中另一普遍性的技术措施为中耕除草。1958年各地丰产田对于中耕、除草都给予极大重视，有的提出“见草就拔，土紧就松”的跃进口号，一般进行中耕除草都在三到五次以上，有的多至十几次。对取得丰收起到积极作用。中耕的作用在于保墒、疏松表土增加土壤含气量，使地温容易升高，促进肥料分解，根部的生理活动加强，植株生育健壮。同时中耕也起到了除草的作用。一般作物的中耕深度，根据植株及根系的生长情况，掌握由浅到深再由深到浅的原则。在施肥、灌溉或下雨之后，土表板结，只要能下地操作，就应该抓紧时间进行中耕，既能保墒又能促进根系对于养分的吸收。对于高秆作物如玉米，麻类等中耕时将行间土壤培在茎秆基部，可以防止倒伏。
    非中耕作物如小麦等在密植情况下如果除草有困难，可以应用除莠剂杀灭双子叶的杂草。在大跃进中，群众在这方面也有很好的创造，例如福建建阳创造土农药除莠剂，为密植后解决除草问题，指出了方向。
    此外，农田的防霜、防冻、防风也是非常重要的田间管理工作，譬如防止早霜可以增加棉花霜前花的比例，使晚熟的谷类和豆类作物子实饱满，使块根作物的含醣量增高。防霜除熏烟等措施外，灌溉和镇压（冬小麦）也有显著效果。1953年华北地区冬小麦在拔节、孕穗期普遍遭受春霜为害，霜冻前，部分水地麦区采取灌水等田间管理措施进行防霜，未受损失；在霜冻后大部分地区立即进行追肥、灌水等措施，使得麦株原有潜伏芽迅速生长，重新分蘖，正常抽穗结实，一般仍有六、七成的产量，比之毁苗改种大为有利。因此，正确的田间管理措施，对某些严重的自然灾害不仅有预防作用，而且有减轻为害保证丰收的功效。
