    Night Boat
    Cui Shan
    There are many such small rivers in the countryside: when the water rises, they are only about fifteen or sixteen feet wide; when the water recedes, you can see the shallow riverbed crisscrossed with rotten mud and pebbles. The river water is yellowish-green and turbid, and flat-bottomed manure boats are often seen traveling on it. The banks are winding paths that are sometimes high and sometimes low. Anyone who walks along them would say: there's nothing to see. However, if you are traveling on a boat in the river, carrying something, and especially if it is at night, it is very interesting.
    I have had several experiences of traveling by boat at night on such small rivers.
    Before the spring plowing, the workers and other residents of the city, in response to the call from the Party Committee to support the countryside with fertilizer, transported large quantities of garbage. A batch was assigned to us and unloaded next to the main road about three miles from the village. We, the cadres sent to the countryside, were not yet proficient in field work, so we strove to take on the task of transporting the garbage back.
    Don't think that this garbage is the same as the rotten vegetable leaves and fish bones commonly seen in the city. This garbage is a black, powdery substance that has already rotted, which, for crops such as cotton and sweet potatoes, is like the bean paste in a Guangdong bun—truly a treasure. How to bring these treasures back? We came up with a combined land and water approach, using both the team's rubber-wheeled carts and renting a large wooden boat. Water transport had to take advantage of the tides; during the spring tide, the tide comes once at noon and once at midnight. Because we had to work in the fields during the day, we decided to act at midnight.
    That night, there was a meeting, and it was already past eleven o'clock when it ended. We set off immediately. It was very cold, and everyone wore two cotton-padded jackets in addition to their woolen sweaters.
    Walking to the river, the cold but fresh air rushed into our noses. The small river, dressed in its charming night attire, was almost unrecognizable. At night, there is light wherever there is water, especially tonight with a full moon. The sparse trees and the reflection of the houses, mixed with the gentle water light, formed a very harmonious picture.
    We got on the boat with farm tools such as baskets and set off with a flurry of hands and feet. Once on the boat, we became bolder. It's the same with everything; once you're "on the horse," you have to ride. Besides, rowing a boat is not a very complicated thing. Although we were not very good at rowing, sometimes heading east and sometimes turning west, moving in a zigzag pattern, we still managed to reach our destination and stopped in front of the asphalt road bridge that spanned the small river.
    The piles of garbage by the roadside looked like continuous mountain peaks from afar. The surface layer of the garbage had turned grayish-white, but as soon as you scooped it with a shovel, the "bean paste" poured out. We couldn't miss the tide! We shoveled quickly, loaded a lot, carried quickly, and unloaded quickly, loading about 5,000 pounds in less than an hour. Everyone was sweating profusely and took off their outer cotton-padded jackets.
      "Let's go!" The boat moved forward smoothly and slowly. Soon, people realized that the boat was moving very slowly. Looking back, it seemed like you could reach out and touch the place where we had stopped. The boat was no longer empty, and it was heading north, against the wind and against the current. What to do? Tow the boat! Two comrades and I jumped ashore, leaving those who claimed to "know the water well" to punt and steer.
    The tow rope was on our backs, and the moonlight from the west connected the three of us into a string of black shadows, clearly imprinted on the bright river surface.
    It had rained for several days recently, and the embankment was full of mud, making it difficult to walk. We couldn't always choose the good paths, because there was still a tow rope on our backs, and a heavy boat at the end of the rope. If there was a low-lying shoal ahead, we had to leave the path and jump down to walk; if there was a row of low-hanging bushes, we had to bend our waists lower than the branches and crawl halfway across; if there was a protruding layer of soil, we had to move sideways, touching it with our bodies; if we encountered a small ditch, we had to jump over it. It was on the third small ditch that I had a little trouble. My front foot crossed over, but my back foot fell into the ditch, and my galoshes filled with water. I didn't even bother to pour it out.
    Walking to the higher embankment, I unintentionally looked to the west and was captivated by the scene before me. A boundless flat field, the moonlight dyeing everything white, the cold air flowing on the ground with a light mist, and in the midst of these mists, there was a semi-elliptical arched building looming faintly. It was truly a magical fairyland!
    I looked back, and the comrades on the boat were lying on top of the pile of garbage, also seeing this amazing sight. We laughed and joked for a while, and then we all fell silent again. I don't know what the other comrades were thinking. I thought, we are laborers, we are participating in the work of creating material wealth. I also thought, moonlight and garbage, light mist and sweat, can be completely unified. Only natural scenery plus people, natural material wealth plus hard work, then these sceneries are alive, and these material wealth are useful...
    Thinking and thinking, I didn't realize that we had already returned to the village. It was already three o'clock in the morning. After unloading the garbage, the comrade reminded me to quickly clean out the water in my galoshes, and asked with concern if my feet were cold. To be honest, I didn't feel cold because I was walking hard all the way. It was only when I was lying in bed that my feet were still ice cold for a long time. I don't know if it was because my feet were cold, or because I was excited by this unusual night boat trip, but it took me a long time to fall asleep.
    I can tell you many more interesting stories about night boat trips. Once, in the pitch-black night, we encountered a deep-draft manure boat stuck in the middle of the river. Our boat couldn't pass, and the tide had already begun to recede. There was no time to lose. The five of us immediately took off our shoes and went into the water, lifting the side of the boat closest to the shore, so that the boat moved sideways, pushing forward inch by inch. We exerted our strength and laughed for a while, making the river water rustle, just like children playing in the water. As a result, we managed to transport thousands of pounds of garbage back in time. Another time, in the afternoon, we went to town to buy bean cakes to transport back. We were delayed in town for some time, and the journey was long, so it was already dusk when we returned. Unexpectedly, we encountered the receding tide midway, and the boat was completely stranded. We prepared to wait until the tide came at midnight on empty stomachs. That night, there was a strong wind and showers, and the weather became colder as the night wore on. This was not a solution. We divided the work: two people went back to the village by land to get clothes and rain gear, and two people stayed on the boat. A comrade and I returned to the village, and the old commune members insisted on getting up to get us something to eat. After eating some delicious pancakes, we walked back to where the boat was stranded. The tide had already come, and we only saw the bamboo pole for tying the boat sticking up in the center of the river, but the boat was gone. We searched for a long time before catching up with the boat that was automatically drifting downstream far away. It turned out that the comrades on the boat were tired of waiting and fell asleep. They did not realize that the tide had come, and the strong initial tide pushed the boat far away...
    Don't you also find the small rivers in the countryside fascinating? Don't you agree that traveling by boat at night in such small rivers is quite interesting? Don't you also think that labor is inherently beautiful and charming?

    夜行船
    崔山
    乡间有不少这样的小河：水涨的时候，不过一丈五六尺宽；水退的时候，就看得见烂泥石子纵横的浅浅的河床。河水是黄绿色的、混浊的，经常行走的是平底的大粪船。两岸是忽高忽低的羊肠小路。任谁走过也会说：没有什么好看的。不过，如果是在河里行船，载运着什么东西，而且又是在夜里，那却是很有意思的。
    我有过好几次在这样的小河里夜行船的经历。
    春耕之前，城市里的工人和其他居民们，就响应党委提出的支援农村肥料的号召，运送了大批垃圾来了。分给我们的一批，卸在离村里约三里多的大路旁边。我们下放干部刚到农村，干田里活还不熟练，便力争把运垃圾回来的任务包下来。
    你不要以为这些垃圾就是城市常见的烂菜叶加鱼骨头之类的东西。这些垃圾是已经腐熟了的黑色的粉状体，对棉花、山芋等作物来说，就等于广东包子里的豆沙，真是宝货。怎样把这些宝货拿回来呢？我们想出了一个水陆并进的办法，既动用队里的胶皮车，又租来了一条大木船。水路运输要趁潮汛，在大汛期里，潮水来的时间，一次在中午，一次在半夜。因为白天要在田里干活，我们就决定在半夜里行动。
    这天晚上，有一个会议，散会的时候已经是十一时多了。我们几个人马上出发。天很冷，每个人除了绒线衫外，还穿上两件棉衣。
    走到河边，寒冷的但是清新的空气，直往鼻子里钻。小河披上妩媚的夜装，简直变得认不出来了。夜里，凡是有水的地方就有光，何况今晚还有满圆的月亮哩。萧疏的树和屋的倒影，混着清柔的水光构成了非常和谐的图画。
    我们带着箩筐等农具上了船，七手八脚地把船撑开了。一上了船，胆子便大了。做什么事情都一样，
  “上了马”就得跑。况且撑船也并不是一件非常复杂的事情。尽管船撑得实在不高明，忽而朝东，忽而拐西，走着之字形，也总算到达了目的地，在横跨小河的柏油路桥前停下了。
    路旁一堆堆垃圾，远望过去像连绵的山峰。垃圾的表层变成灰白色，可是一锹铲过去，“豆沙”就倾泻出来了。不能错过潮汛！我们紧铲、多装，扛得快，卸得快，不到一个钟头就装了约五千斤。大家满头大汗，都脱了外面的一件棉衣。
      “开船罗！”船平稳地缓缓前行。不久，人们发觉船走得非常慢，回头看看，原来停泊的地方好像伸手就能摸得着。现在的船不是空船了，而且是朝北走，逆风又逆水。怎么办？背纤！我和两个同志跳上岸去，留下那些号称“已经摸熟水性”的人来撑篙、撑舵。
    纤绳勒在背上，月光从西边把我们三个人连成一串黑影，清晰地印在明亮的河面上。
    最近下了几天雨，堤岸上净是泥泞，很难走。又不能尽挑好路走，因为背上还有一根纤绳，绳那端还有一条重＠的船。前面是低洼的浅滩，那就要离开小路跳下去走；是一排低垂的灌木，就要把腰弯得比树枝还低地半爬过去；有一块突出来的土层，就要完全侧着身体挨移过去；遇着小沟就要跳过去。就在第三条小沟上，我出了一点小毛病，前脚跨过去了，后脚却掉落沟里，套鞋里灌了水，也顾不得把它倒出来。
    走到地势较高的堤岸，无意中朝西面一望，我们都被眼前的景色迷住了。一片没有边际的平坦田野，月光把一切都染成白茫茫的，冷空气和着轻雾在地面上流动着，在这些雾气当中，有个半椭圆拱形的建筑物若隐若现。这真是奇幻的仙境！
    我回头看看，船上的同志爬在垃圾堆上面，也看到了这片奇景。我们笑闹了一阵，又都沉默起来。我不知道其他同志在想些什么。我想，我们是劳动者，我们参与着创造物质财富的工作。我又想，月光和垃圾，轻雾和汗水，完全可以统一。只有自然景色加上人，自然物质财富加上艰辛的劳动，那末，这些景色才是活的，这些物质财富才是有用的……
    想呀想的，不觉已经回到村里。这时候已经是午夜三时了。卸完了垃圾，同志提醒我赶快清理一下套鞋里的水，关心地问我的脚冷不冷。说真的，一路上用劲走着，并不觉得冷。只是睡在被窝里的时候，许久脚还是冰冷的。不知道因为脚冷，还是因为被这头一次不平常的夜行船所激动，我很久才能入睡。
    我还可以向你讲许多夜行船的有趣的故事。有一次，在黑沉沉的夜里，半路上碰着一条呆在河中的吃水较深的大粪船，我们的船过不去，这时候已经开始退潮，事不宜迟，我们五个人立刻赤脚下水，把靠岸那边的船身硬抬起来，使船侧着身走，真的是一寸一寸地向前推进。我们使一会力气笑一会，弄得河水哗啦哗啦地响，就好像孩子们戏水一样开心。结果及时地把几千斤垃圾运回去了。又有一次，下午，到镇上购买豆饼运回去。在镇上耽误了一些时间，路程又远，回来时已经是傍晚，不料中途就碰着退潮，船完全搁浅了。我们准备饿着肚子守候到半夜潮来。这晚上刮大风，还下着阵雨，夜越深天气越冷。这不是办法。我们作了分工，两个人从陆路回去拿衣服、雨具，两个人在船上留守。我和一个同志回到村里，老社员们无论如何要爬起来为我们弄一些吃的东西。吃了一些好吃的煎饼再走回原来船搁浅的地方，潮水已经来了，只看见河中心竖插着系船的竹篙，船却失踪了。我们找了许久，才在下游很远的地方追上那条自动顺流倒退着的船。原来船上的同志守候得疲倦起来，睡着了，没有发觉潮来，来势很猛的初潮便把船推送得老远……
    你是否也觉得乡间小河使人神往？是否同意在这种小河里夜行船挺有意思？是否也认为劳动本来就是很美丽，很迷人？
