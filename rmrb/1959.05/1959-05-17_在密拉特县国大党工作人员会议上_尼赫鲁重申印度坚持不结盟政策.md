    Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, May 16th. According to a report from the Press Trust of India in Ghaziabad, Prime Minister Nehru yesterday firmly defended India's non-aligned policy. He said that if a country invites a foreign country to protect itself against a possible expected attack, "that would be extremely foolish."

    Nehru said that he had heard some statements about India's security possibly being threatened. Some people even suggested that India should ally itself with a certain foreign country to strengthen its defense. However, this approach would violate the foundation of the country's position.

    Prime Minister Nehru made these remarks while speaking at the closing session of the three-day meeting of Congress Party workers in Meerut District held in Ghaziabad.

    Nehru said that India has no enemies, so there is no question of it seeking assistance from abroad to defend itself. He said, "This approach of inviting a third country, even when there is some dispute between the two parties, is absurd and ridiculous. That is how the British entered India, and we must not forget this historical lesson."

    He later mentioned the "attacks launched" by Chinese newspapers and Chinese leaders on India regarding the Tibet issue while speaking at a public gathering. He said that despite this, India continues to maintain its position with restraint and dignity.

    The Prime Minister said that India is doing this not because it is afraid of anyone, but because "we believe this is a sensible approach."

    Nehru said that about twelve thousand Tibetan "refugees" have already come to India. This certainly means a burden on our country, "but we will not drive them away."

    Nehru said that whoever comes to India's doorstep seeking refuge is welcomed and treated as a friend of the family, which "has always been India's tradition." "So when we receive these Tibetan refugees and take care of them, it is in line with our country's fine traditions."

    在密拉特县国大党工作人员会议上
    尼赫鲁重申印度坚持不结盟政策
    新华社新德里16日电　据印度报业托辣斯加齐亚巴德消息，尼赫鲁总理昨天坚决地维护印度的不结盟政策。他说，如果一个国家邀请某个外国来保护自己以防止预料可能遭到的进攻，“那将愚蠢之极”。
    尼赫鲁说，他听到一些关于印度的安全可能受到威胁的说法。有些人甚至于建议，印度应该同某一外国结盟，来加强它的防御。但是，这种做法将是违反这个国家的立场的基础的。
    尼赫鲁总理是在加齐亚巴德举行的、历时三天的密拉特县国大党工作人员会议的闭幕会议上讲话时这样说的。
    尼赫鲁说，印度没有敌人，因此不存在它向国外寻求援助以保卫自己的问题。他说，“邀请第三国的这种做法，即使在双方发生某种纠纷的时候，也是荒谬可笑的。英国人就是这样进入印度的，我们一定不能忘记这个历史教训。”
    他后来在公共集会上发表讲话时提到中国报刊和中国领袖在西藏问题上对印度“进行的攻击”。他说，尽管这样，印度继续克制地和有尊严地保持它的立场。
    总理说，印度之所以这样做，不是因为它害怕任何人，而是因为“我们认为，这是通情达理的做法”。
    尼赫鲁说，大约有一万二千名西藏“难民”已经来到了印度。这肯定意味着是我们国家的负担，“但是我们不会把他们撵走”。
    尼赫鲁说，不管谁来到印度的大门口要求避难，他都受到欢迎和被当作是家里的朋友，这“一直是印度的传统”。“所以当我们接待这些西藏难民和照顾他们的时候，这是符合我们国家优良的传统的。”
