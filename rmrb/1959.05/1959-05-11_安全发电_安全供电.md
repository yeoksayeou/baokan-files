    Safe Power Generation, Safe Power Supply
    Ensuring safe power generation and supply, so that all sectors of the national economy can carry out production without interruption, is a regular and extremely important task for the power industry.

    In recent years, all staff and workers in the power industry have taken a series of effective measures in terms of safe power generation and supply, basically ensuring the electricity needs of industrial production. In 1958, electricity production units in various regions increased equipment output and unprecedentedly increased equipment utilization hours, supporting the Great Leap Forward nationwide. However, the foundation for safe production in the power industry is still not very solid, and safe power generation and supply remain issues that the power industry must pay close attention to.

    In order to meet the electricity needs of the rapidly developing national economy and truly enable the power industry to shoulder the "pioneer" task, the installed capacity of the power industry this year must increase even more than in 1958. Most of the equipment to be put into production this year are new products made and trial-produced in our country. Operators are not yet familiar with their performance, and most of the personnel are new, requiring a learning process. Moreover, the existing equipment, after a year of intensive operation last year, has had its maintenance intervals extended, and some equipment has not been maintained for more than a year. These circumstances place higher demands on safe production in the power industry this year. Electricity units in various regions must conscientiously take all effective measures ideologically, organizationally, and technically, do a good job in preparing for the operation of new machines, and do a good job in the maintenance and repair of existing equipment, so that both new and old equipment can normally supply the electricity needs of all sectors of the national economy.

    Power plants and power supply units have hundreds of power generation and substation equipment, as well as many high-voltage transmission lines that are hundreds or even hundreds of kilometers long. It takes a tremendous effort to ensure that these equipments operate normally without any accidents during frequent operations and frequent manipulations, and that they produce normally every second. Experience has shown that all electricity units must closely rely on the masses, adhere to the already effective organizational and technical measures, and establish and improve the necessary rules and regulations in order to avoid or reduce accidents.

    The Yangshupu Power Plant in Shanghai is a relatively old plant and also one of the largest thermal power plants currently. This plant maintained a glorious record of no accidents for more than two years from 1956 to 1958. Among power supply units, Jilin, Tonghua, and Shijiazhuang have not had power transmission accidents for more than a year, and Benxi, Xuzhou, and Zibo have not had substation accidents. The fundamental reason why these units have been able to maintain safe production for a long time lies in their emphasis on mobilizing the masses, implementing the concept of safety into every specific task, into every technical and organizational measure, into every operation, and into every maintenance project, so that the idea of safe production truly takes root among the masses, and everyone can ideologically understand the important role of ensuring safe power generation and supply in the national economy, and realize that their every push and pull in operation is related to the normal progress of industrial production, thereby providing a strong guarantee for safe production.

    The important role of safe power generation and supply in the national economy is undoubtedly clear to all staff and workers in the power industry. However, in specific work and practical actions, some units often neglect safe production due to one-sidedness in their thinking methods and lack of meticulousness in their work style in a certain period or in a certain task. Some units have experienced a situation of destroying more than establishing in the reform of rules and regulations, and strictly enforced the rules and regulations that should be strictly implemented, which is very detrimental to safe power generation and supply. Therefore, making comprehensive arrangements for all tasks in various periods, and being able to consider the effects of safety and economy when taking any measures, rather than doing this and losing that, is very important for ensuring safe power generation and supply, and for completing the power industry production tasks in a more, faster, better, and more economical way.

    In order to generate more electricity, supply more electricity, and generate electricity safely, mass technological innovation and technological revolution movements must be carried out in the power industry production. In the Great Leap Forward last year, the staff and workers of electricity production units, with the spirit of daring to think and act, promoted live-line work on high-voltage power transmission lines, and promoted new technologies such as live-line flushing of blades and flushing of condensers on power generation equipment, which greatly ensured the safe operation of equipment, and also generated more electricity and supplied more electricity. Electricity production units in various regions must continue to promote these experiences, and on this basis, further develop these new technologies, so that all power generation and power supply equipment can eliminate some of the equipment defects that can be eliminated as much as possible without power outage, without shutdown, and without stopping the machine. According to the current production characteristics of the power industry, the technological innovation and technological revolution movements in the power industry production should focus on several aspects: repairing equipment, revising rules and regulations, and rapidly improving the technical level of employees. In terms of equipment maintenance, it is necessary to greatly shorten the maintenance time by reforming tools and innovating maintenance methods while ensuring the quality of maintenance. In terms of technical rules and regulations, the masses should be mobilized to revise them according to the equipment performance and operating conditions, and earnestly implement them in work. In terms of improving the technical level of employees, various training methods should be adopted, the quality of training should be improved, and the training time should be shortened. Only in this way can we better grasp the equipment operation rules and ensure safe power generation and supply.

    To ensure safe power generation and supply, we must also be good at using the spirit of continuous revolution to promptly point out new directions and put forward new requirements to all personnel based on the changing laws of equipment in operation and the lessons learned in the struggle against accidents, and fully mobilize the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses to strive to achieve these requirements. This is an important guarantee for safe power generation and supply. Doing so can prevent relaxation of effort and complacency, making the safety foundation more and more solid; it can also enable us to be prepared for contingencies and nip problems in the bud.

    In the first quarter of this year, electricity production units in various regions have adopted a mass movement method that combines upper and lower inspections, ideological inspections and equipment inspections, comprehensive inspections and safety inspections, electricity department inspections and user inspections, and doing a great job, working hard, and working skillfully and meticulously to conduct comprehensive inspections of the operating conditions of new and old equipment, maintenance work, personnel training, as well as technical management, rules and regulations, and other aspects. We believe that this approach of finding the root causes of accidents from all aspects, taking measures, and eliminating accidents can not only achieve immediate results, but also win time and take the initiative to lay a good foundation for safe production throughout the year and better guarantee safe power generation and supply. Electricity units in various regions should, on this basis, further rely on the masses, summarize the experience of safety inspections, and continue to solve the problems that have not been completely solved in the inspection. At the same time, earnestly implement the set of mass line leadership methods formed in the Great Leap Forward last year, and immediately launch a production competition movement centered on "generating more and using less, supplying more and losing less, and ensuring safe production" in the national electricity production units to greet the great 10th anniversary of the National Day with greater achievements.

    安全发电  安全供电
    保证安全发电和供电，使国民经济各个部门能够不间断地进行生产，是电力工业经常的十分重要的任务。
    几年来，电力工业的全体职工，在安全发电和安全供电方面，采取了一系列的有效措施，基本上保证了工业生产的用电需要。1958年，各地电业生产单位提高了设备出力，空前地提高了设备利用小时，支援了全国的大跃进。但是，电力工业的安全生产基础还是不很巩固的，安全发电，安全供电，目前仍是电力工业部门需要十分注意的问题。
    为了适应国民经济飞跃发展的用电需要，使电力工业真正担负起“先行”的任务，今年电力工业的装机容量要比1958年增加得更多。这些要在今年投入生产的设备，大部分都是我国自制和试制的新产品，运行人员对它的性能还不够熟悉，而且多数人员都是新手，需要一个学习的过程。而现有的设备，经过去年一年紧张的运行，延长了检修间隔，有的设备甚至一年多没有检修。这些情况，就对今年电力工业的安全生产提出了更高的要求。各地电业单位必须认真地从思想上、组织上、技术上采取一切有效措施，做好新机投入运行前的准备工作，作好现有设备的维护与检修工作，使新旧设备都能正常地供给国民经济各部门的用电需要。
    电厂和供电单位都有数以百计的发电和变电设备，还有许多长达百公里乃至数百公里以上的高压输电线路。要这些设备在经常运行和进行频繁的操作中不发生任何事故，分秒不停地正常生产，是一件需要付出巨大努力才能办到的事情。经验证明，各个电业单位必须紧密地依靠群众，坚持执行已经行之有效的组织措施和技术措施，建立和健全必需的规程制度，才能够避免发生或少发生事故。
    上海杨树浦发电厂是一个较老的厂，也是目前火力发电厂中的一个大厂。这个厂从1956年到1958年，曾经保持了两年多无事故的光荣记录。在供电单位中，一年多没有发生送电事故的有吉林、通化、石家庄等单位，没有发生变电事故的有本溪、徐州、淄博等单位。这些单位所以能够长期地保持安全生产，根本原因在于重视发动群众，把安全思想贯彻到每一项具体工作中去，贯彻到每项技术措施和组织措施中去，贯彻到每一个操作中去，贯彻到每一个检修项目中去，使安全生产的思想真正在群众中扎下根来，使每个人都能从思想上认识保证安全发电供电在国民经济中的重要作用，认识到自己在操作中的一推一拉都关系着工业生产的能否正常进行，从而使安全生产获得了有力的保证。
    安全发电供电在国民经济中所起的重要作用，对电力工业的全体职工来说，本来是一个毋庸置疑的问题。但是，有些单位在具体工作和实际行动中，却由于思想方法上的片面性以及工作作风上的不够细致，在某一个时期或某一项工作中，常常忽视了安全生产。有的单位在规程制度的改革中，曾出现过破多立少，对应当坚决执行的规程制度执行不严等情况，这都是对安全发电供电很不利的。因此，在各个时期，对各项工作加以全面安排，并且在采取任何措施时能够考虑到安全和经济的效果，而不是干了这个丢了那个，这对于保证安全发电供电，多快好省地全面完成电业生产任务是十分重要的。
    为了多发电、多供电、安全发电，在电力工业生产中，必须开展群众性的技术革新和技术革命运动。在去年大跃进中，电业生产单位的职工，以敢想敢干的精神，在高压送电线路上推行了带电作业，在发电设备上推行了带负荷冲洗叶片、冲洗凝结器等新技术，从而大大保证了设备的安全运行，也多发了电，多供了电。各地电业生产单位必须继续推行这些经验，并在这个基础上，进一步地发展这些新的技术，使所有发电和供电设备，尽可能的在不停电、不停炉、不停机器的情况下，消除可以消除的一些设备缺陷。根据当前电力工业的生产特点，电力工业生产中的技术革新和技术革命运动，应该围绕检修设备、修订规程制度和迅速提高职工技术水平几个方面。在设备检修方面，要通过改革工具、革新检修方法，在保证检修质量的前提下，大力缩短检修时间。在技术规程制度方面，应该根据设备性能和运行情况，发动群众加以修订，并在工作中认真地贯彻执行。在提高职工的技术水平方面，应该采取各种培训方法，提高培训质量，缩短培训时间。只有这样，才能更好地掌握设备运行规律，保证安全发电供电。
    要保证安全发电供电，还要善于根据设备在运行中的变化规律和在向事故作斗争中所取得的经验教训，用不断革命的精神，及时地向全体人员指出新的方向，提出新的要求，把广大群众的积极性和创造性充分发挥起来，为实现这些要求而努力。这是安全发电供电的重要保证。这样做，就能防止松劲思想和自满情绪，使安全基础越来越巩固；就能做到未雨绸缪，防微杜渐。
    今年第一季度，各地电业生产单位都采用了上下检查相结合，思想检查与设备检查相结合，全面检查和安全检查相结合，电业部门检查和用户检查相结合，大干、苦干和巧干、细干相结合的群众运动方法，对新旧设备的运行情况，对检修工作、人员培训以及技术管理、规程制度等方面，进行了全面的大检查。我们认为，这种从各方面找出事故根源，采取措施，杜绝事故的做法，不仅可以收到立竿见影之效，而且可以赢得时间，争取主动，为全年安全生产打好基础，更好地保证安全发电供电。各地电业单位应该在这个基础上，进一步依靠群众，总结安全检查经验，继续解决在检查中没有完全解决的问题。同时认真贯彻在去年大跃进中形成的一套群众路线的领导方法，在全国电力生产单位中，立即掀起一个以“多发少用、多供少损、确保安全生产”为中心的生产竞赛运动，以更大的成绩来迎接伟大的国庆十周年纪念。
