　　I warmly support Premier Zhou Enlai's government work report, Vice Chairman Li Weihan's work report of the Standing Committee of the Second National Committee of the CPPCC, the special reports of Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen.

　　Now I would like to express some preliminary opinions based on my joyful and encouraging experiences.

　　The Extraordinary Year of 1958

　　1958 was a year of the Great Leap Forward in China. It was also the most glorious and extraordinary year in human history.

　　People cannot forget that in this year, the Soviet Union, the leading country of our socialist camp, achieved great scientific achievements, breaking human history records. As our Premier pointed out, it "first launched an artificial Earth satellite and then launched the world's first artificial planet," opening a new era for mankind from the Earth age to the interplanetary age. It can be said that this was an extraordinary year of the leap forward in mankind's conquest of the universe. At the same time, in our country this year, the first year of our Second Five-Year Plan, due to the comprehensive advancement of the people of the whole country on the economic, political, ideological, and scientific and technological fronts, there emerged an unprecedented Great Leap Forward in the national economy in our history, opening up a far-reaching and glorious example for history. Following the horizon, a rising sun appeared—a new social organization, the people's commune. Can this be said to be not an extraordinary year of mankind's transcendence and glory?!

　　China's Great Leap Forward has attracted the attention and importance of people all over the world, and has also brought fear, slander, and hatred to imperialism and all reactionaries. But as Professor Charles Hendry, Dean of the Social Sciences Faculty of the University of Toronto, Canada, said about his impressions of visiting China: "The Great Leap Forward is a powerful and vivid reality. Everywhere, a disciplined effort for national development moves the observer greatly." He also said meaningfully: "I dare to predict that in the research of scholars fifty, one hundred, or one thousand years from now, this important decade of China will likely be regarded as the most comprehensive, thorough, and important decade in human history."

　　The facts of the Great Leap Forward have moved scholars in capitalist countries. And they believe that "China's decade" will still be valued and given the highest evaluation by scholars who study it a thousand years later. Indeed, although capitalist countries are shrouded in layers of fog and miasma by the reactionary ruling class, there are still clear-headed people and many people with a sense of justice. This fair attitude and pursuit of truth are worthy of our welcome.

　　First of all, the National Agricultural Development Program revised by our country in 1957 stipulated the targets for per-unit-area yield of grain and cotton by 1967, that is, the ten-year targets. Most areas achieved them ahead of schedule in 1958! This year was a comprehensive leap forward. The most prominent are: in the industrial sector, the output of steel, pig iron, coal, locomotives, automobiles, power machinery, cotton spinning machines, papermaking equipment, and in the agricultural sector, the output of grain, cotton, and flue-cured tobacco, all increased by more than 100% compared with 1957. The output of antibiotics, power generation equipment, and grain combine harvesters in the industrial sector increased by more than 300%. The irrigated area increased this year by more than 90% compared with 1957. The number of students, such as in universities, increased by 50% compared with 1957, and the number of secondary vocational schools increased by 89%. Our country was originally a poor and backward country. After the three-year economic recovery period after liberation, the first Five-Year Plan began in 1953. In 1958, the first year of the Second Five-Year Plan, in terms of the output of steel and coal, the absolute figures took Britain more than fifty years to achieve, but our country caught up in six years! Moreover, taking coal as an example, the actual output in 1958 was already behind our country.

　　1958 was an extraordinary year. What does this illustrate?

　　This is not only a prominent year in which the socialist system has written an irrefutable victory in the peaceful competition between the two camps compared to the capitalist system, and the countries and camps of the capitalist system have obviously lost. At the same time, it also shows that the socialist system is indeed an invincible new force, and the capitalist system is inevitably heading towards decay and death.

　　Recently, an editorial in the American "New York Times" on April 13 also cited the "Central Intelligence Agency's report on Russia," saying: "In the past seven years, the Soviet Union's industrial production has increased at almost three times the speed of our own." It also seriously warned: "The United States is actually committing economic suicide." At the same time, it also admitted that the Soviet Union's "military efforts are already quantitatively the same as ours." From here, we can also see that the American imperialist paper tiger is outwardly strong but inwardly weak, and at the same time, it precisely shows that the decay of the capitalist system has reached its dead end.

　　In 1958, not only did a rising sun appear on the horizon in eastern Asia—the powerful and vital people's commune—but the outline of the Soviet Union's magnificent seven-year plan, the leader of the socialist camp, "foretelling the arrival of an infinitely beautiful communist society in front of all mankind, is not far away," was also announced, "marking that the Soviet Union's development of the national economy has entered an important historical period—the period of comprehensively launching the construction of a communist society."

　　Chairman Mao is right, the enemy is rotting day by day, and we are getting better day by day. Taking the capitalist road is bound to lead to death. Taking the socialist road is the road to national prosperity and the highest interests of mankind. Isn't this truth clear enough? But as our Premier said: "The reasons for our Great Leap Forward are something that imperialists cannot understand and are unwilling to understand." In addition to their jealousy and hatred, their only magic weapon is the paper hand grenades they throw out casually, saying "forced," "slave labor," and so on. Isn't this deceiving oneself as well as others, just as the "New York Times" said, "The United States is actually committing suicide"? Of course, the death of imperialism is the destiny of history, it is irreversible, and there is no effective medicine that can cure it.

　　The Great Leap Forward of 1958 did not come out of thin air. First of all, this is destined by the superiority of the socialist system. This is due to the wise and correct leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, putting politics in command, a series of measures, and the rise of the socialist consciousness of the people of the whole country after the rectification movement. Therefore, it created favorable conditions in many aspects and brought into play unparalleled enthusiasm, especially with the foundation of the completion of the first Five-Year Plan and the guidance of the general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results. Of course, our great achievements are inseparable from the selfless assistance of the socialist camp, especially the Soviet Union, and the absorption of their advanced experience, and inseparable from the selfless labor, contribution of strength, and breaking of superstitions, opposing conservatism, and the communist style of unity and cooperation of all nationalities and all strata of the country, especially our workers and peasants.

　　"Summarize the epic of the Great Leap Forward, inspire the bugle call for another leap forward," this is the unanimous call of the 600 million people today, and it is also the common battle slogan of the whole country.

　　But there is no doubt that our enemies will never be reconciled. Earlier, rumors and sabotage continued to come, and in the future, they will intensify even more. Therefore, raising our vigilance and strengthening our unity must be listed as the primary chapter while accelerating the even greater leap forward.

　　The Unification of the Motherland is the Highest Interest of All Nationalities

　　The Premier pointed out: "The unification of the motherland is the highest interest of all nationalities." This is another shining beacon raised by the nationalities after the general line. At the same time, it is a powerful and practically significant great political call, which deserves our special attention.

　　In the past century, imperialism invaded China, consistently attempting to disintegrate China's unity, undermine the unity of China's nationalities, and hate the patriotic movements of advanced classes and students. It even blatantly proposed the division of China, the division of spheres of influence, and even military interference and occupation. We have long-term painful experience. After World War II, imperialists continued to create tensions, even interfering in the internal affairs of other countries or carrying out subversion activities. This is a well-known fact. The recent local rebellion in Tibet, where the Dalai Lama was abducted abroad, is another prominent example. As our Premier pointed out: "Under the capitalist system, the more developed and powerful nations always try to keep other nations in a backward state in order to oppress and exploit them." Isn't this a true and unmistakable law? They put on the cloak of democracy and freedom, using free competition or material assistance as a cover, practicing the strong bullying the weak, the majority oppressing the minority, and the big fish eating the small fish, using the blood and sweat of others to fertilize their own soil and decorate their own pockets. They are no exception to the vast majority of the working people and petty bourgeoisie in their own countries. It is not surprising, this is precisely the essence of the exploiting class regime under the capitalist system. It would be strange if there were no oppression, no exploitation, no aggression. This is the so-called unlimited freedom or standard freedom of the "free world"!

　　Therefore, the people of all nationalities who love our motherland, and our friendly neighbors who have suffered from imperialist disasters, must first recognize the essence and face of imperialism. Do not be deceived by temporary rumors or sweet words. At the same time, we will also realize that only the socialist regime and country truly represent and safeguard the interests of the vast majority of the working people, assist backward nations, and help progress from economic, political, and cultural aspects, jointly improve, in order to achieve the noble wish of "I am for everyone, and everyone is for me," which is also in line with the fundamental principles of socialism. This is true for domestic affairs, and naturally there will be no discrimination against foreign national countries. In today's world, under the opposition of two social systems, it is not difficult to recognize which is a progressive and revolutionary system, and which is a backward and reactionary system, who is righteous, and who is unjust. Therefore, who is a friend, who is an enemy, who is a friend, and who is an enemy, is also very clear.

　　My government's suppression of the Tibetan rebellion is precisely the execution of the powers conferred by the sacred Constitution of our country, which is in line with the interests of all nationalities in the motherland and the interests of the Tibetan people. Rewarding meritorious deeds and punishing crimes is a matter of national discipline and a matter of internal affairs, which is absolutely not allowed to be interfered with by any foreigners. The arbitrary slander and false accusations by imperialism and foreign reactionaries are futile, and taking the opportunity to expand and muddle through is despicable. This is what we firmly oppose. In particular, we express our utmost indignation at the so-called Dalai Lama's statement under duress.

　　The armed rebellion in Tibet was precisely because a few reactionary upper-class elements were deceived by the conspiracies of imperialism. We hope that they will turn back as soon as possible and correct their evils, so as to redeem themselves from the people of the motherland. We express our sympathy and deep concern for the Dalai Lama who was abducted abroad and lost his freedom. We wish him to get rid of it as soon as possible and return safely to the embrace of the motherland.

　　Therefore, I also express deep concern for the people of Taiwan, who are isolated overseas, and the patriotic Kuomintang military and political personnel who have been under the control and enslavement of American imperialism for ten years. This Tibetan incident is precisely an opportunity for you to make meritorious deeds and redeem yourselves as soon as possible. Do not make mistakes again and again, speak for imperialism, cut yourselves off from the motherland, and cut yourselves off from the people.

　　"The unification of the motherland is the highest interest of all nationalities." This is a truth that we must pay great attention to and strengthen unity. Therefore, we must be vigilant at all times against the provocation, division, and sabotage of imperialism. We must resolutely counterattack any interference in internal affairs by imperialism and foreign reactionaries. "Unity," "vigilance," and "counterattack" are the "three treasures" of our people of all nationalities to safeguard the interests of the motherland, and are the right to overcome evil.

　　People's Communes are Infinitely Good

　　This time I went out and looked at a few people's communes, and I realized that "the unified leadership of the people's commune is the highest interest of all management areas and production teams in the commune." The main basis for the development of the people's commune is the comprehensive and continuous leap forward in agricultural production in our country and the increasingly high political consciousness of the 500 million farmers. Due to the requirements of the development of the situation, there must be more centralized allocation of labor; there must be a stronger economic base such as financial and material resources; it is necessary to break the boundaries of societies, townships, and counties and have more concentrated land; in order to carry out basic farmland construction such as water conservancy construction, massive accumulation of fertilizer, and the overall allocation and support of mechanization, electrification, and technical personnel. The original single agricultural production cooperatives with dozens or hundreds of households can no longer undertake the new tasks of this situation development. The people's commune has greatly unified the leadership of labor, economy, and land, and concentrated allocation and use, giving greater play to the power of collectivism. Farmers said that they are doing wonders by grasping agriculture with one hand and industry with the other. First of all, thanks to the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, there is a general line, politics is in command, there are two legs walking, there is the Eight-Character Charter, there are cadres going down to the grassroots, there is the soaring enthusiasm of the members, and even more so, there is the unified leadership and strong strength of the people's commune's highly "three collectives"—labor collective, economic collective, and land collective.

　　The facts are exactly like this, many miracles are exciting. The speed of rural industrial development is unexpected, from nothing to something, from small to large, from few to many. There are dozens of commune factories, and there are dozens of fewer. The commune transferred 1,000 or 2,000 people to specialize in factories, and also trained hundreds and thousands of technical cadres. For example, Liangzhu Commune in Hangzhou drew more than 2,000 people to engage in industry and established 19 factories of various sizes, including agricultural tool manufacturing and repair factories (which have produced 112 rice transplanters, increasing efficiency by 12 times compared with manual transplanting), fertilizer factories, cement factories, refractory brick factories, grain processing factories, starch factories, etc. It also established explosives factories, pottery clay mines, fluorite mines, etc. In addition, 60 tons of steel and 120 tons of iron were smelted. The industrial output value is 2,797,135 yuan. The masses believe that it is impossible to do without the people's commune. In addition, there are nurseries (180), kindergartens (94), primary schools (36), agricultural middle schools, hygiene hospitals, health centers (5), health stations (62), canteens (120), film teams, broadcasting stations (476), amateur cultural troupes, etc., everything is available. The hospital has four departments: internal medicine, surgery, dentistry, and obstetrics, a laboratory, and 100 convalescent beds.

　　For example, Zhejiang Province originally had no heavy industry, but now it has begun to have steel plants, machinery plants, oxygen generator plants, etc. Iron ore and coal mines were discovered in the province, with abundant reserves, which are mined locally. Generally, there are no engineers and veteran workers, starting from scratch. However, they took technological revolution as the center, with the purpose of improving production, and their enthusiasm was soaring. For example, the Banshan Machinery Factory was opened last autumn and put into production on October 1st. There are already more than 50 technological innovations. Due to the idea of supporting the steel marshal with a chess game, the ten-day task was completed in four days. A workshop with more than 2,900 square meters was completed in seven days and immediately put into production. There are 3,687 workers, 80% of whom are farmers (55% of whom are demobilized soldiers, with particularly high political awareness). They eat, live, and work together, the factory director works with the workers, runs the factory diligently and thriftily, and walks on two legs. Their characteristic is starting a family from scratch.

　　The female labor force in each commune has been completely liberated (6,000 or 7,000 people per commune). Jianqiao Commune also has a factory run entirely by women (March 8th Cement Factory), but unfortunately I didn't get to visit it.

　　Agriculture has also greatly changed its appearance. We saw that the per-mu yields of rice, vegetables, tea, and certain economic crops in several communes (Lingqiao Commune, Liangzhu Commune, Jianqiao Commune, Changhe Commune, West Lake Commune, etc.) in 1958 almost doubled compared to 1957 (several times compared to the early days of liberation). For example, Liangzhu Commune has 60,346 mu of paddy fields, and the per-mu yield was only more than 200 jin before. It has been growing continuously after liberation. 300 jin in 1952, 360 jin in 1953 (mutual aid society), 440 jin in 1954, 540 jin in 1955 (cooperativization), 612 jin in 1956 (full cooperativization), 549 jin in 1957 (ideological relaxation, reduced production), 1,057 jin in 1958 (Great Leap Forward after rectification). Changhe Commune has 31,637 mu of paddy fields, 552 jin in 1957, and 1,007 jin in 1958. The rape used to be planted with a maximum of 10,000 plants per mu, but now it is 45,000 plants. We personally saw the golden rapeseed flowers, each plant straight, densely packed, endless at a glance. It would be impossible to find someone hiding inside. This is really the first time I have opened my eyes in my life. Jianqiao Commune has more than 25,000 mu of vegetables, with a per-mu yield of 2,489 jin in 1957 and 4,600 jin in 1958. The highest yield of Chinese cabbage is 60,000 jin. The heaviest weight is more than 30 jin each. There are more than 400 varieties of vegetables. Last year, it didn't rain for 84 days. Liangzhu Commune used 12 water pumps to send the water from below all the way to the top of the mountain, layer by layer, implementing large-scale cooperation to overcome difficulties. At the end of winter and the beginning of spring, 11 reservoirs were built.

　　Commune cadres generally also serve as propagandists, technicians, and labor managers, becoming all-rounders. They, along with commune members, demobilized soldiers, women, and children, all plant satellite fields. Gao Zhixing, a 14-year-old from Jianqiao Commune, and three other children planted 4.5 mu of wheat field, with a target of 20,000 jin and striving for 25,000 jin. The slogan they wrote is: "Don't look at me as small, my ambition is higher than you, I will definitely launch a satellite and strive to run to Beijing." When we looked at it, those satellite fields were already more than a foot high (three times higher than the average), densely packed, each plant was straight, heavy and green, the tops were cut evenly, endless at a glance, indeed it was undoubtedly a satellite. These satellite experimental fields have accumulated experience and technology, and will be fully promoted in 1959 for an even greater leap forward. Women are also full of enthusiasm. For example, there are three days off for the Spring Festival, but the masses do not rest on the first day of the lunar new year. One woman didn't want to visit her daughter. She said, "Daughters are always daughters." She would rather run to the fields herself to knock ice and soil.

　　I have cited a few examples at random as proof, of course, due to space limitations, it is extremely incomplete, but it is exciting enough to see the prosperity of the countryside, its appearance, and the complete correctness of the policy of walking on two legs.

　　The enthusiasm in the countryside is soaring because the lives of farmers have risen, which is one of the important reasons. For example, an old woman worried about eating every year. Last October, the commune was established. Not only did she not have to pay for food, putting down the heavy burden in her heart, but she also received 160 yuan at the end of the year, and she laughed awake in her dreams. Some commune women are already difficult to distinguish from urban women. I also saw a group of female commune members driving tractors neatly dressed through the highway, and many male commune members riding bicycles, weaving back and forth, bustling, and the difference between urban and rural areas felt smaller. Each commune has a long-term plan. They said, "Come and see again in three years." This sentence shows their full confidence and inner joy.

　　All communes, except for the elderly entering nursing homes, have not heard of anyone's unemployment. On the contrary, there is a shortage of labor everywhere. This is something that capitalist countries cannot understand, and in addition to malicious slander, they will also consider it a miracle.

　　Thousands of words only touch on one issue, which is the issue of the superiority of the socialist system. At the same time, it is the issue of the Party's leadership and the ideological education of the Marxist worldview.

　　Today, the countryside is full of enthusiasm, the appearance is new, and the atmosphere is prosperous. The "forced" and "slave labor" mentioned by imperialism are nonsense, and it is indeed as Chairman Mao said, "600 million people are all Yao and Shun." Don't underestimate it, not having to pay for food, having life insurance, infinitely good prospects, and the commune backing you up, this is the Great Leap Forward in human history, which is unprecedented.

　　We must thank and praise the leading core in the national political life - the Communist Party of China! "Without the Communist Party, there would be no new China," this sentence is always the truth.

　　Socialism! Motherland! Working people! Communist Party! Mao Zedong! These five solemn and beautiful nouns, linked together, are a great epic of our time today.

　　Finally, I want to shout: Long live the socialist camp! Long live the People's Republic of China! Long live the great unity of the people of all nationalities! Long live the Communist Party of China! Long live Chairman Mao Zedong, the great leader of the people of all nationalities!

　　生活在伟大的时代、伟大的祖国
    安若定委员的发言
    我热烈拥护周恩来总理的政府工作报告、李维汉副主席的政协第二届全国委员会常委会工作报告、李富春、李先念两位副总理和彭真副委员长的专题报告。
    现在我愿以欢欣鼓舞的心情，说出下面一些体会的初步意见。
    不平凡的一九五八年
    一九五八年是中国大跃进的一年。它也是人类历史中最光荣和不平凡的一年。
    人们不能忘记，这一年，我们社会主义阵营首脑苏联盟国的科学的伟大成就，打破人类历史纪录，正如我们总理指出的“首先发射了人造地球卫星之后，又发射了世界上第一个人造行星”，为人类从地球时代开辟了踏进星际时代的新纪元，可以说，这是人类征服宇宙的跃进的不平凡的一年。同时，在我国这一年，即我国第二个五年计划的第一年，由于全国人民向经济战线、政治战线、思想战线和科学技术战线的全面进军，出现了一个我国历史上前所未有的国民经济的大跃进，为历史开辟了一个影响深远的光辉的范例，跟着地平线上又出现了一个初升的太阳——一种新的社会组织的人民公社，这能说不是人类超凡入圣的光荣的不平凡的一年吗？！
    中国的大跃进，引起了全世界人士的注意和重视，也带来了帝国主义和一切反动派的恐惧、诬蔑与仇恨。但正如加拿大多伦多大学社会科学院院长查尔斯·汉德里教授谈访华观感说：“大跃进是一个有力的和生动的现实。每个地方，一种为了国家发展而进行的有纪律的努力使观察者大为感动。”又意味深长地说：“我敢预言，在五十年、一百年或一千年以后的学者的研究中，中国的这个重要的十年很可能被认为是人类历史中最全面、最彻底和最重要的十年。”
    大跃进的事实，感动了资本主义国家的学者们。并且认为“中国的十年”在千年以后还被研究的学者重视，给以崇高至尊的评价。的确，资本主义国家中虽然被反动统治阶级笼罩着一层又一层的迷雾和毒瘴，但是究竟还有头脑清醒的人们，还有不少正义感的人们。这种公正的态度和真理的追求是值得我们欢迎的。
    首先，我国一九五七年修订的全国农业发展纲要规定粮食和棉花的单位面积产量到一九六七年的指标，也就是说十年的指标，大部分地区在一九五八年就提前实现了！这一年，是全面的跃进。最突出的是：工业方面如钢、生铁、煤炭、机车、汽车、动力机械、棉纺机、造纸设备和农业方面如粮食、棉花、烤烟的产量，都比一九五七年增长了百分之一百以上。工业方面的抗菌素、发电设备、谷物联合收割机的产量则是增长了百分之三百以上。这一年的增加灌溉面积，比一九五七年增加了百分之九十以上。学生人数如高等学校比一九五七年增加了百分之五十，中等专业学校更是增加了百分之八十九。我国原是一穷二白的落后大国，解放后经过三年的经济恢复时期，从一九五三年开始第一个五年计划，到一九五八年进入第二个五年计划的第一年，但就钢和煤的产量来说，那些绝对数字，在英国是走了五十多年的路，给我国的六年就赶上了！而且拿煤来说，一九五八年的实际产量，英国已经落在我国的后边。
    一九五八年是不平凡的一年。这说明了什么问题？
    这不但是社会主义制度在对比资本主义制度的两个阵营在和平竞赛中写出无可辩驳的胜利的突出的一年，资本主义制度的国家和阵营显然地是输了，同时也是说明了社会主义制度确实是不可战胜的新生力量，资本主义制度是必然地走向衰朽与死亡。
    最近美国“纽约时报”四月十三日社论也举出美国“中央情报局关于俄国的报告”中说：“在过去的七年中，苏联工业生产增加的速度几乎为我国自己的三倍。”还严重地警告说：“美国实际上是在经济上自杀。”同时又承认苏联“在军事方面的努力在数量上已经像我们一样”。从这里，也可看出美帝纸老虎外强中干的不打自招，同时正是说明资本主义制度腐朽已经到了穷途末路。
    一九五八年不但在亚洲东部的地平线上出现了初升的太阳——强大的生命力的人民公社，社会主义阵营首脑的苏联“在全人类面前预告无限美好的共产主义社会的到来，已经为期不远”的一个宏伟的七年计划的提纲也公布了，“标志着苏联的发展国民经济已经进入一个重要的历史时期——全面开展共产主义社会建设的时期”。
    毛主席说的对，敌人在一天天烂下去，我们在一天天好起来。走资本主义的道路，是必然走向死亡的道路。走社会主义的道路，才是国家兴旺和符合人类最高利益的道路。这条真理难道还不够明白吗？但正如我们总理所说：“我们的大跃进的原因，是帝国主义者所不能够了解和不愿意了解的。”他们妒恨之余，唯一的法宝，只有随手掷出的一颗颗纸制的手榴弹，说什么“强迫的”、“奴隶劳动”等等。这不是欺人自欺，正如“纽约时报”所说的“美国实际上是自杀”吗？当然，帝国主义的死亡，是历史命运注定了的，是无可挽回，是没有特效药可以诊治的。
    一九五八年的大跃进，不是凭空而来的。首先，这是社会主义制度的优越性注定了的。这是由于党和毛主席英明的正确领导、政治挂帅、一系列的措施和全国人民在整风运动后社会主义觉悟的高涨。因而创造了多方面的有利条件和发挥了冲天无比的干劲，特别是有第一个五年计划完成的基础和鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线的指引。当然，我们的伟大成就是与社会主义阵营特别是苏联的无私援助和吸收他们的先进经验是分不开的，是与全国各民族、各阶层特别是我工农大军的忘我劳动、贡献力量和破除迷信、反对保守、团结协作的共产主义风格是分不开的。
    “总结大跃进的史诗，鼓舞再跃进的号角”，这正是六亿人民当前的一致呼声，也是全国上下共同的战斗口号。
    但是，毫无疑问，我们的敌人是决不会甘心的。早些时造谣破坏不断而来，今后变本加厉更在意中。因此，我们提高警惕和加紧团结，就必须在更大跃进的同时列为首要的一章。
    祖国的统一是全国各民族的最高利益
    总理指出：“祖国的统一是全国各民族的最高利益。”这是继着总路线之后又一次给全国各族人民高举了一盏光芒万丈的明灯。同时也是一个有力的并有现实意义的伟大的政治号召，值得我们特别重视的。
    在过去的一百年中，帝国主义侵略中国，一贯企图瓦解中国的统一，破坏中国各民族的团结，仇视先进阶级和学生的爱国运动，还曾明目张胆地提出瓜分中国、划分势力范围，甚至于武力进扰和占据。我们是有长期的痛苦经验的。二次大战后，帝国主义者还在不断地制造紧张局势，甚至于干涉别国内政或者进行颠复活动。这是众所周知的事实。最近的西藏地方叛乱，达赖喇嘛被劫出国外，又是一个显著例子。正如我们总理指出的：“在资本主义制度下，比较发达的、强大的民族总是竭力使别的民族保持落后状态，以便对他们进行压迫和剥削。”这难道不是一条千真万确的定律吗？他们披着民主自由的外衣，借着自由竞争或者物资援助的掩护，实行强凌弱、众暴寡、大鱼吃小鱼，拿别人的膏血来肥沃自己的土壤，装璜自己的荷包。对自己国内绝大多数的劳动人民和中小资产阶级，也绝不例外。事情并不奇怪，这正是资本主义制度下剥削阶级政权的本质所在。不压迫、不剥削、不侵略，才是怪事。这就是所谓“自由世界”的无限自由或者是标准自由！
    因此，我们热爱祖国的各族人民，曾经受过帝国主义灾难的友好邻邦，必须首先认清帝国主义的本质与面貌。不要为一时的造谣诬蔑或者甜言蜜语所迷惑。同时也一定会认识到只有社会主义的政权和国家，才是真正代表和维护绝大多数劳动人民的利益，援助落后的民族，从经济、政治、文化各方面，帮助进步，共同提高，以达到我为人人、人人为我的高尚愿望，也是符合社会主义的根本原则。对国内如此，对国外的民族国家也当然不会歧视。在今天世界两种社会制度的对立之下，谁是进步的、革命的制度，谁是落后的、反动的制度，谁是正义，谁是非正义，是不难认识的。因而谁是亲，谁是仇，谁是朋友，谁是敌人，也是很清楚的。
    我政府的平定西藏叛乱，正是执行了神圣的我国宪法赋予的职权，是符合祖国各民族的利益的，也是符合西藏人民利益的。赏功罚罪，这是一个国家的纲纪问题，也是一个内政问题，是绝不容许任何外国人干涉的。帝国主义和外国反动派的任意污蔑造谣中伤是徒劳的，乘机扩张混水摸鱼是可耻的。这是我们坚决反对的。特别对被劫持下的所谓达赖喇嘛声明，表示万分愤慨。
    西藏的武装叛乱，正是少数上层反动集团分子受了帝国主义的阴谋诡计的迷惑。我们希望他们及早回头，改邪归正，以自赎于祖国人民。对达赖喇嘛的被劫国外，失去自由，我们表示同情和深切关怀。我们祝颂他及早摆脱、安全回到祖国的怀抱来。
    因而我对孤悬海外的台湾人民和已有觉悟的爱国的国民党军政人员，十年来在美帝的控制和奴役之下同样表示深切的关怀。这次西藏事件正是你们立功自赎早日反正的机会，不要一误再误，为帝国主义张目，自绝于祖国，自绝于人民。
    “祖国的统一是全国各民族的最高利益。”这是一条真理，我们必须万分重视，加紧团结。因而对帝国主义的挑拨、离间、破坏，必须随时警惕。对帝国主义和外国反动派的干涉内政，必须毫不容忍地加以全力反击。“团结”、“警惕”、“反击”，这就是我们各族人民维护祖国利益的“三宝”，是正能克邪的。
    人民公社无限好
    我这次外出看了几个人民公社，体会到“人民公社的统一领导，是全社各管理区、各生产队的最高利益”，道理正是这样。人民公社发展的主要基础是我国农业生产全面的不断的跃进和五亿农民愈来愈高的政治觉悟。由于形势发展的要求，必须有更多的劳动力的集中调配；必须有更雄厚的经济基础如财力物力；必须打破社界、乡界、县界有更集中的土地；以便农田的基本建设如水利建设、大量积肥，以及实现机械化电气化和技术人力的全盘调配与支援。原有的几十户、几百户的单一农业生产合作社已经不能担任这一形势发展的新任务。人民公社正是大大地统一领导了劳动、经济和土地，加以集中调配使用，更大地发挥了集体主义的威力的。农民兄弟说，一手抓农业、一手抓工业，出现大奇迹。首先由于党和毛主席的领导，有了总路线，有了政治挂帅，有了两条腿走路，有了八字宪法，有了干部下放，有了社员冲天干劲，更是有了人民公社高度的“三个集体”——劳动集体、经济集体、土地集体的统一领导，实力壮大。
    事实正是如此，许多奇迹令人感到兴奋。农村工业发展的速度，是出人意表的，从无到有，从小到大，从少到多。公社工厂少的有十几个，多的有几十个。公社调出一千人或两千人去专搞工厂，还培训了成百成千的技术干部。如杭州良渚公社抽出二千多人搞工业，办了大小十九个工厂，有农具制造修理厂（已制出一百一十二具插秧机，效率比人工插秧提高十二倍）、化肥厂、水泥厂、耐火砖厂、粮食加工厂、淀粉厂等。还办了炸药厂、陶土矿、砩石矿等。此外，炼了六十吨钢，一百二十吨铁。工业产值是二百七十九万七千一百三十五元。群众认为没有人民公社是办不到的。此外，托儿所（一百八十个）、幼儿班（九十四个）、小学（三十六所）、农业中学、卫生医院、卫生所（五个）、保健站（六十二个）、食堂（一百二十个）、电影队、广播站（四百七十六个）、业余文工团等等，应有尽有。医院有内、外、牙、妇四科，化验室一个，休养床一百张。
    又如浙江省原是没有重工业的，现在开始有了钢铁厂、机械厂、制氧机厂等。本省发现铁矿、煤矿，蕴量丰富，就地开采。一般没有工程师和老工人，白手起家。但是他们以技术革命为中心，以提高生产为目的，干劲冲天。如半山机械厂去年秋季开办，十月一日即投入生产，现已有五十多种技术革新。由于一盘棋思想支援钢铁元帅，十天的任务经四天完成。一个有二千九百多平方的车间，七天完工，立即投入生产。有三千六百八十七名工人，百分之八十是农民（其中有百分之五十五是转业军人，政治觉悟特高）。他们同吃同住同劳动，厂长与工人一道干，勤俭办厂，两条腿走路，他们的特点是白手成家。
    各公社的妇女劳动力已经全部解放（每社有六千人、七千人不等）。笕桥公社还有全是妇女办的工厂（三八水泥厂），可惜没有去参观。
    农业方面也是大大地改变了面貌。我们看到几个公社（灵桥公社、良渚公社、笕桥公社、长河公社、西湖公社等）一九五八年的水稻、蔬菜、茶叶和某些经济作物的亩产量，比一九五七年几乎都翻了番（比解放初期是翻几番）。如良渚公社水稻田为六万零三百四十六亩，亩产量以前只有二百多斤。解放后不断增长。一九五二年三百斤，一九五三年三百六十斤（互助社），一九五四年四百四十斤，一九五五年五百四十斤（合作化），一九五六年六百一十二斤（全面合作化），一九五七年五百四十九斤（思想放松，减产），一九五八年一千零五十七斤（整风后大跃进）。长河公社水稻田为三万一千六百三十七亩，一九五七年五百五十二斤，一九五八年一千零七斤。油菜往年亩种最多一万株，现为四万五千株。我们亲眼看到菜花金黄，株株笔直，密密无间，一望无际，如果有人躲藏里面是绝难发现的。这真是我有生以来第一次开眼界。笕桥公社蔬菜二万五千多亩，一九五七年亩产二千四百八十九斤，一九五八年四千六百斤，大白菜最高产量六万斤。重量最大的每个三十多斤。蔬菜品种在四百种以上。去年八十四天不下雨，良渚公社用十二个抽水机一层接一层，把下面的水一直送到山头上，实行大协作，克服困难。冬末春初又修筑了十一个水库。
    公社干部一般兼做到宣传员、技术员和劳动管理员，成为多面手。他们和社员、复员军人、妇女、儿童都种有卫星田。笕桥公社十四岁的高志兴等四个儿童种麦四分五厘田亩，指标二万，争取二万五。他们写的标语是：“不看我的小，志气比你高，定把卫星放，争取北京跑”。我们看时，那些卫星田已经长了一尺多高（比一般高出三倍），密密紧，株株挺，沈沈绿，顶头斩齐，一望无际，确实已为卫星无疑。这些卫星试验田积累了经验技术，又为一九五九年全面推广，将作更大跃进。妇女也是冲天干劲，例如春节放假三天，但群众正月初一也不休息。有一位不愿去探望女儿，她说，“女儿总是女儿”，宁愿自己跑到田里去敲冰敲土了。
    随手举出一些例子，作为论证，当然为篇幅所限，是极不全面的，但已足够令人兴奋，看出农村前途的兴旺、面貌以及两条腿走路政策的完全正确。
    农村的干劲冲天，由于农民生活都已上升，这是重要的原因之一。例如有一老妇年年愁吃，去年十月公社成立，不但吃饭不要钱，放下了心上的千斤担，到年还分得一百六十元，梦里也笑醒了。有些公社妇女已同城市妇女难以区别。还见到一群女社员服装整齐驾驶拖拉机群通过公路上，不少男社员骑着自行车，往来如织，熙熙攘攘，城乡区别也感到小了。各公社都订有远景规划。他们说，“你们过三年再来看看”。这句话，表示了他们的信心充满和内心喜悦。
    所有公社，除了老年人进敬老院外，再没有听到任何人的失业，相反，到处都在感到劳动力的不足。这从资本主义国家看来确是不会理解的，除了恶意诬蔑外，也将会认为是一个奇迹吧。
    千言万语，只是触及到一个问题，即是社会主义制度优越性的问题。同时即是党的领导问题、马克思主义世界观的思想教育问题。
    今天，农村的干劲冲天，面貌一新，气象兴旺。帝国主义所说的“强迫的”、“奴隶劳动”，这是胡说，而确确实实正如毛主席所说的“六亿人民皆舜尧”了。不要小视，吃饭不要钱，生活有保险，前途无限好，公社作撑腰，这就是人类历史的大跃进，是史无前例的。
    我们要万分感谢和歌颂国家政治生活中的领导核心——中国共产党！“没有共产党，就没有新中国”，这句话永远是真理。
    社会主义！祖国！劳动人民！共产党！毛泽东！这五个庄严而美丽的名词，连缀起来，就是我们今天时代里一首伟大的史诗。
    最后，我要高呼：社会主义阵营万岁！中华人民共和国万岁！各族人民大团结万岁！中国共产党万岁！各族人民的伟大领袖毛泽东主席万寿无疆！
