　　Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 7th. Our agency's on-site reporter with the army reports on the victorious pursuit and suppression of rebel bandits in the Shannan area in April: As our People's Liberation Army pursued the Tibetan rebel bandits, Tibetan compatriots in various places rose up to support them, leading the PLA through the snow, cutting off the escape routes of the rebel bandits, causing the rebel bandits to collapse.

　　Under the pursuit of our army, the rebel bandits of the Dajin Temple and two other groups of Khampa rebel bandits fled to the south of San'an Qulin, merged together, and wanted to flee to the Luoyu area. The local people automatically rose up and cut off several rattan rope bridges, putting more than 600 rebel bandits into a desperate situation on steep cliffs.

　　Some rebel bandits, under the pursuit of our army, killed each other in a scramble to escape. When our army was suppressing the rebel bandits in Poxhang Creek, the bandit leaders forced their subordinates to resist, but their subordinates scrambled to escape, resulting in infighting, which resulted in seven deaths. Enzhu Cang·Gongbu Zhaxi, one of the main rebel bandit forces, fled to Maixi Creek under the pursuit of the People's Liberation Army. When they heard the sound of gunfire coming from the north, Enzhu Cang ordered his subordinates to fight desperately to cover his and some of his leaders' escape. His subordinates were dissatisfied and opened fire on the leaders, killing six or seven people.

　　Many people who were deceived and coerced into participating in the rebellion, inspired by our army's policy of leniency towards prisoners, surrendered to our army or fled home. About 500 people fled from Enzhu Cang·Gongbu Zhaxi's bandit gang. More than 70 people fled from the remnants of the rebel bandit Zhaxi Boza's gang of more than 200 people on their way from Lhasa to Longzi Zong. More than 100 people who participated in the rebellion in the Gongbu area were coerced to Maling. When they heard that the People's Liberation Army was carrying out the suppression of the rebellion, they dispersed in a panic.

　　The scattered bandits in various places have lost their fighting spirit under the joint blocking and attack by our People's Liberation Army and the Tibetan people. On April 22, our army entered Chuxu, and the rebel bandits hurriedly abandoned more than 600 mules and horses and some supplies and fled. On the same day, a unit of our cavalry advanced into the mountain gully occupied by the fleeing Khampa rebel bandits. The rebel bandits fled upon hearing the news. Without firing a single shot, we seized 52 mules and horses and 4 guns. On April 17, when a certain unit of our army crossed the Qilila Snow Mountain, Zhou Shirong and Yan Yuyun, two soldiers who fell behind due to foot pain, encountered the remnants of the rebel bandit cavalry Bu Jiaoxi near Luoxu. The two soldiers raised their submachine guns and fired only three bursts, killing three rebel bandits and wounding one. The bandit leader Bu Jiaoxi hurriedly led his remnants to raise their hands in surrender. The two soldiers captured 96 rebel bandits, seized 29 rifles, 1 pistol, 14 homemade guns, 95 horses, 76 knives, and 639 rounds of ammunition. Some rebel bandits in the Shannan area who fled into the deep mountains could not endure the cold and hunger, and came out of the mountains in groups of three or five to find the People's Liberation Army to surrender their weapons. Our army treated them leniently.

### 藏族同胞奋起支援平叛大军  山南地区叛匪纷纷土崩瓦解

　　藏族同胞奋起支援平叛大军
    山南地区叛匪纷纷土崩瓦解
    新华社拉萨7日电　本社随军记者报道我军4月份胜利追剿山南地区叛匪情景说：我人民解放军平叛部队追击西藏叛匪，各地藏族同胞奋起支援，为解放军踏雪引路，断绝叛匪逃路，叛匪纷纷土崩瓦解。
    在我军追剿下，大金寺叛匪和另外两股康巴叛匪逃到三安曲林南面之后，汇合到一起，想窜往珞瑜地区，当地人民自动起来把几座藤索桥砍断，使六百多名叛匪陷入峭壁断崖的绝境中。
    有些叛匪在我军追击下，因为争相逃命而互相残杀。我军进剿颇章溪卡的叛匪时，匪首逼其部属抵抗，其部属争着要逃命，当时发生了内哄，结果打死了七个人。号称叛匪主力之一的恩珠仓·公布扎西股匪在解放军追击下逃到麦溪卡，又听到从北方传来的枪炮声，恩珠仓即下令要部下卖命，掩护他和一些头目逃跑，其部下不满，于是向头目们开起火来，打死了六、七个人。
    许多受欺骗、被裹胁参加叛乱的分子，在我军宽待俘虏政策的感召下，纷纷向我军投降或逃跑回家。恩珠仓·公布扎西股匪逃跑了约五百人。叛匪扎西伯扎残部二百多人从拉萨逃往隆子宗的途中，逃走了七十多人。工布地区参加叛乱的一百多人，被裹胁到麦岭时，听到解放大军进行平叛，就一哄而散。
    各地流窜散匪在我人民解放军和藏胞合力堵击下，已无斗志。4月22日我军进驻褚许，叛匪慌忙丢下骡马六百多匹和物资一部逃窜。同一天，我骑兵某部向流窜康巴叛匪盘踞的山沟进剿，叛匪闻风逃窜，我一枪未发，即缴获骡马五十二匹、枪四支。我军某部在4月17日翻越启里拉雪山时，因为脚痛而掉队的战士周士荣、严玉运二人，在罗许附近和叛匪骑兵布交西残部遭遇，这两个战士当时端起冲锋枪只打了三个点射，打死叛匪三名，打伤一名。匪首布交西慌忙率领残部举手投降。两名战士俘虏九十六名叛匪，缴获了步枪二十九支、手枪一支、土枪十四支、马九十五匹、刀七十六把、子弹六百三十九发。山南地区有些逃入深山的叛匪忍受不了冻饿，三、五成群自动出山找寻人民解放军交出武器投降，我军都予以宽待。
