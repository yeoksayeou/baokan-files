We completely agree with the Government Work Report made by Premier Zhou Enlai and the reports by Vice Premier Li Fuchun, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and Vice Chairman Li Weihan.

First of all, on behalf of the China Association for Science and Technology at all levels and all its members, we express our warm support at this solemn meeting for the State Council's order to quell the armed rebellion of the former Tibetan local government and the reactionary upper-class clique, and we warmly congratulate the rapid success of the People's Liberation Army Tibet Military Region troops in quelling the rebellion with the cooperation of the Tibetan monks and laypeople! We express our utmost indignation at the so-called "Tibetan independence" conspiracy orchestrated by British imperialism and other foreign reactionaries. However, no matter how much effort some people put into creating a so-called "Statement of the Dalai Lama," or even if they produce some other ugly farce in the future, it will not change the bright and happy future of the Tibetan people in the slightest. The great transformation of the Tibetan people, shaking off the feudal serf system and entering the era of democracy and socialism, has now begun. We warmly congratulate the new birth of Tibet. We scientific and technological workers are willing to contribute our strength to the construction of Tibet.

Our country's socialist revolution and socialist construction have already achieved undeniable great achievements. Under the shining light of the general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, after two or three more five-year plans, our country will fundamentally change its "poor and blank" appearance and be built into a socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture. We scientific and technological workers have a strong confidence and a dedicated will for the bright future of our beloved motherland and vow to accelerate the process of national construction with all our strength under the leadership of the Party.

Over the past ten years, China's scientific and technological undertakings have developed greatly, and the face of the scientific and technological ranks has also changed greatly. Especially after the general line was put forward, under the impetus of the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production in 1958, the mass movement of the whole Party and the whole people to run science and technology in a big way and to engage in technical innovation and technical revolution has begun to form a climax. The role of science and technology in industrial and agricultural production is becoming increasingly significant. On the one hand, international advanced scientific and technological experience has been widely used, and on the other hand, we have also made our own original achievements. But on the whole, our country's scientific and technological level is still backward, and arduous efforts must be made to meet the requirements of production and construction. We fully agree with Premier Zhou's instructions on scientific and technological work in his report: "The task of directly serving production and construction should be given top priority," and "Sufficient attention should also be paid to the research of cutting-edge science and basic theory." We must implement Premier Zhou's instructions in our work.

Now we will make a statement on the recent work of the China Association for Science and Technology.

    Be a good assistant to the Party in the mass movement of technological revolution

The China Association for Science and Technology (referred to as CAST) was established in September last year by merging the former National Federation of Natural Science Societies of China and the China Association for Science and Technology Popularization under the new situation of the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production and the great leap forward in scientific and technological work. The Party Central Committee stipulates that the task of CAST is: "A tool and assistant for the Party to mobilize the vast number of scientific and technological workers and the broad masses of the people to carry out the technological revolution and cultural revolution and build socialism and communism." In the past six months, under the leadership of the Party, with the efforts of CAST organizations at all levels and the masses of members, CAST work has greatly developed on the basis of past work. CAST organizations have been established in all provinces, cities, autonomous regions, and most counties, and basic CAST organizations have also been established in many local people's communes and factories and mines. The various natural science specialized societies affiliated to CAST have also begun to become active recently. The role of CAST in serving production and developing scientific and technological undertakings is becoming increasingly significant. CAST organizations in many places have made useful contributions to the mass movement of all the people refining steel, deep plowing, water conservancy construction, tool reform, and various production movements, and have become a useful assistant to the local Party committee in carrying out the mass movement of technological innovation and technological revolution. Of course, our work is still far from being done well, and there are still many shortcomings. In some places, CAST work has not yet been carried out, and in some places where CAST organizations have been established, the work is still very superficial, and its role in production is not significant. The activities of various natural science specialized societies are also very uneven. We still need to work hard to improve our work in order to be a good assistant to the Party in the mass movement of technological revolution.

    Scientific and technological professional institutions must be combined with mass scientific and technological activities

The practice of CAST work has made us deeply realize that in order to develop China's science and technology faster and better, we must conscientiously implement the "walking on two legs" policy formulated by the Party. We especially realize the policy that scientific and technological professional institutions must be combined with mass scientific and technological activities. The reason why CAST work can be carried out relatively quickly is because there is such an objective necessity.

In recent years, especially in the past year, the scientific and technological research institutions of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the central industrial departments, the scientific and technological research institutions of various localities, and the scientific research work of various universities and colleges have all greatly developed. These institutions are the backbone of our country's scientific and technological undertakings, and the work they carry out has been and will of course continue to play a very important role in the development of our country's science and technology. However, if we only see the role of scientific and technological professional institutions and ignore mass scientific and technological activities, it is still "walking on one leg" instead of "walking on two legs," and it is impossible to promote the development of production and scientific and technological undertakings faster and better. Of course, any scientific and technological professional institution must carry out its work according to the mass line working method, and should also actively mobilize the scientific and technological personnel of its own unit to participate in the mass movement of technological innovation and technological revolution. However, the main task of these professional institutions should be to complete the important scientific and technological tasks stipulated by the state, and they should not and cannot rely on them to "specially" be responsible for solving all the scientific and technological problems that occur in the production and life of the broad masses. Moreover, the mass activities carried out by scientific and technological professional institutions naturally proceed more from their own business requirements, while the masses' requirements for science and technology are multifaceted. Therefore, we must mobilize and organize the vast number of scientific and technological workers and the broad masses, rely on the masses' own strength and wisdom, carry out mass scientific and technological activities, and combine them with scientific and technological professional institutions in order to quickly and effectively deal with the thousands of large and small, various, and ubiquitous scientific and technological problems that appear in industrial and agricultural production and the lives of the broad masses of the people. We must correctly understand the roles and interrelationships between the work of scientific and technological professional institutions and the scientific and technological activities of the broad masses, so that the two can be closely combined, mutually support each other, and play a complementary role.

In mass scientific and technological activities, we should also implement the "walking on two legs" policy, which requires both extensive and in-depth popularization work, as well as improvement work combined with popularization; both extensive exchange of the practical experience of workers and peasants, and timely theoretical summaries; and both extensive absorption of inventors and technical innovators from the workers and peasants, and a large number of scientific and technological personnel from intellectuals in mass scientific and technological organizations. Only with such mutual combination can the mass movement of technological innovation and technological revolution be carried out well.

    CAST is the most suitable mass organization to combine experts and the masses

The China Association for Science and Technology is a mass science and technology organization that meets this need. Because CAST organizations have the following four characteristics: First, specialization. CAST is a mass organization engaged in scientific and technological activities. CAST members all have certain expertise in science and technology. At the National CAST and provincial, municipal, and autonomous region CASTs, various natural science specialized societies have been and are being organized according to different disciplines and industries to organize members working in various positions in the same discipline or industry and carry out various activities according to their specialties. In addition to mutual professional contacts, the activities of grassroots CASTs can also receive business guidance from higher-level CASTs. This kind of activity of CAST facilitates the relevant production departments to mobilize scientific and technological forces more widely, exchange technical experience, carry out academic activities, implement the "let a hundred flowers bloom" policy, and is also conducive to promoting the ideological transformation of intellectuals and promoting the combination of intellectuals with workers and peasants. Second, mass participation. CAST currently has 6 million members nationwide, including a large number of intellectual scientific and technological personnel, as well as a large number of worker and peasant inventors and activists in the technical innovation and technical revolution movement, who are connected to the broad masses. This has formed a nationwide network of mass scientific and technological activities. Third, the activities are extensive and regular. CAST's business scope covers a large amount of work in scientific research, academic exchanges, cadre training, summarizing and promoting advanced experience, popularizing scientific knowledge, and international activities. CAST organizations at all levels have extensive contacts with various regions and relevant units. The National CAST and various national natural science specialized societies also have extensive international contacts. And very importantly, these activities of CAST are carried out regularly among the broad masses, which has greater practical significance. These characteristics of CAST enable CAST to play the role of the Party's tool and assistant in the unity, development, and mobilization of scientific and technological forces.

The general task of the China Association for Science and Technology in 1959 is: Under the leadership of the Party, to go all out with revolutionary vigor, to do everything possible to encourage the enthusiasm of scientific and technological workers and the broad masses, to cooperate closely with relevant parties, to promote a broader and deeper mass movement of technological innovation and technological revolution, to greatly improve China's labor productivity, and to strive to achieve the 1959 national economic construction plan centered on the four major indicators of steel, coal, grain, and cotton.

The development of Chinese science and technology must pay attention to absorbing the achievements of international science and technology. To this end, the China Association for Science and Technology will also strengthen its ties with scientific organizations in the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, and in particular, it will strengthen the study of advanced Soviet science and technology. The China Association for Science and Technology will also actively support the work of the World Federation of Scientific Workers, strengthen its ties with various international scientific organizations, strengthen the struggle against nuclear weapons testing, and strive to increase human happiness and defend world peace.

Fellow representatives, fellow committee members: The China Association for Science and Technology has made very few contributions to the country, and CAST's work lacks experience. We ask all representatives and committee members to constantly criticize and supervise our work. We guarantee that we will conscientiously implement the resolutions of this conference in our future work, resolutely rely on the leadership of the Party, closely combine with production, and carry out mass scientific and technological activities extensively and deeply to make due contributions to the realization of the 1959 national economic plan.

　　中国科学技术协会必须为实现国民经济计划而战斗
　　李四光　丁颖　侯德榜　黄家驷　严济慈　竺可桢　刘承钊　周培源  丁西林　杜国庠　夏康农　茅以升　苏步青代表　范长江委员的联合发言
    我们完全同意周恩来总理所作的政府工作报告和李富春副总理、李先念副总理、彭真副委员长、李维汉副主席的报告。
    我们首先代表中国科学技术协会各级组织和全体会员，在这个庄严的会场上，表示热烈拥护国务院关于平定原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团武装叛乱的命令，热烈祝贺人民解放军西藏军区部队在西藏僧俗人民合作之下戡平叛乱的迅速成功！我们对于英帝国主义等和外国反动派所策动的所谓“西藏独立”的阴谋，表示万分的愤慨。但是尽管有人费尽心血搞出了一个所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”，甚至以后再搞出些什么别的丑剧，也丝毫不能改变西藏人民幸福光明的前途。西藏人民摆脱农奴制度、进入民主和社会主义的时代的伟大变革，现在已经开始了。我们热烈地祝贺西藏的新生。我们科学技术工作者愿为西藏的建设，贡献自己的力量。
    我国社会主义革命和社会主义建设已经取得了无可否认的伟大成就。在鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义总路线的光辉照耀下，再经过两、三个五年计划的努力，我国即将根本改变“一穷二白”的面貌，建成现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的社会主义国家。我们科学技术工作者对于我们亲爱祖国的灿烂前途抱有坚强的信心和献身的志愿，誓以我们的全力，在党的领导下，加速祖国建设的进程。
    十年来，我国科学技术事业有了很大的发展，科学技术队伍的面貌也有了很大的变化。特别在总路线提出之后，在一九五八年工农业生产大跃进形势的推动下，全党全民大办科学、大闹技术革新和技术革命的群众运动已开始形成高潮。科学技术在工农业生产中的作用，日益显著。这一方面是广泛运用了国际先进的科学技术经验，同时也有了我们自己独创的成就。但是总的来说，我国科学技术水平还是落后的，必须进行艰苦的努力，才能适应生产建设的要求。我们完全同意周总理报告中对科学技术工作的指示：“直接为生产建设服务的任务，应当放在首要的地位”，“对尖端科学和基础理论的研究，也应该给以足够的重视。”我们一定要把周总理的指示，贯彻到工作中去。
    现在我们就中国科学技术协会最近的工作情况，作一发言。
    当好党在技术革命群众运动中的助手
    中国科学技术协会（简称科协）是在工农业生产大跃进和科学技术工作大跃进的新形势下，合并了原中华全国自然科学专门学会联合会和中华全国科学技术普及协会两个团体，于去年九月建立的。党中央规定中国科协的任务是：“党动员广大科学技术工作者和广大人民群众进行技术革命和文化革命，建设社会主义和共产主义的一个工具和助手。”半年多来，科协工作在党的领导下，在各级科协组织和会员群众的努力下，在过去工作的基础上，有了很大的发展，各省、市、自治区和大部分的县都有了科协的组织，许多地方的人民公社和厂矿也有了科协的基层组织。科协所属各级各种自然科学专门学会，最近也开始活跃起来。科协在服务生产和发展科学技术事业中的作用，日益显著。许多地方的科协组织，在全民炼钢、深翻土地、水利建设、工具改革和各项生产运动中，作出了有益的贡献，成为当地党委进行技术革新和技术革命群众运动的一个有用的助手。当然，我们的工作还作得很不够，还有不少缺点。有些地方，科协工作还没有开展起来，有些已建立起科协组织的地方，工作还很不深入，对生产的作用还不大，各自然科学专门学会的活动情况，也是很不平衡的。还需要努力改进我们的工作，才能当好党在技术革命群众运动中的助手。
    科学技术专业机构必须与群众性科学技术活动相结合
    科协工作的实践，使我们深深体会到：要更快更好地发展我国科学技术，必须认真贯彻党所制定的“两条腿走路”的方针，我们体会特别具体的是科学技术专业机构必须要与群众性科学技术活动相结合的方针。科协工作之所以能比较迅速地开展，就是由于有这样一个客观的必要性存在。
    几年来，特别一年来，中国科学院、中央各产业部门的科学技术研究机构、各地方的科学技术研究机构，和各高等学校的科学研究工作，都有很大的发展。这些机构是我国科学技术事业的骨干力量，它们所进行的工作，对我国科学技术的发展，一直在并且当然继续起着非常重要的作用。但是，如果只看到科学技术专业机构的作用，忽视群众性的科学技术活动，仍然是“一条腿走路”，而不是“两条腿走路”，就不可能更快更好地促进生产和科学技术事业的发展。当然，任何科学技术专业机构都必须按群众路线的工作方法进行工作，并且也应该积极发动本单位科学技术人员参加技术革新和技术革命群众运动。不过，这些专业机构的主要任务，应该是完成国家规定的重要的科学技术任务，不应该也不可能依靠它们“专门”负责解决广大群众在生产和生活中所发生的一切科学技术问题。并且科学技术专业机构所进行的群众活动，很自然地多从本身的业务要求出发，而群众对科学技术的要求，却是多方面的。因此，必须发动和组织广大科学技术工作者和广大群众，依靠群众自己的力量和智慧，开展群众性科学技术活动，并和科学技术专业机构结合起来，才能迅速而有效地处理工农业生产和广大人民生活中千千万万、大大小小、各种各样、随时随地出现的科学技术问题，我们必须正确认识科学技术专业机构的工作同广大群众的科学技术活动两者的作用和相互关系，使二者相互密切结合、相互支援，起相辅相成的作用。
    在群众性的科学技术活动中，也应当贯彻“两条腿走路”的方针，既要有广泛的深入的普及工作，又要有与普及相结合的提高工作；既要广泛交流工农群众的实际经验，又要有及时的理论的总结；在群众性的科学技术组织中既要广泛吸收工农群众中的创造发明家、技术革新家，又要有大量的知识分子出身的科学技术人员。这样的互相结合，技术革新和技术革命的群众运动，才能很好的开展起来。
    科协是使专家和群众相结合最合适的群众团体
    中国科协就是符合这种需要的学科技术群众团体。因为科协组织具备以下四个特点：一、专门性。科协是进行科学技术活动的群众团体。科协会员都在科学技术上有一定专长。在全国科协和省、市、自治区科协，都已经和正在按不同的学科和产业组织了各种自然科学的专门学会，把同一学科或产业的在各种不同工作岗位上工作的会员组织起来，按专业来进行各种活动。基层科协的活动，除相互的专业联系外，也可以得到上级科协的业务指导。科协这种活动，便于有关生产部门更广泛地调动科学技术力量，交流技术经验，开展学术活动，贯彻“百家争鸣”的方针，又有利于促进知识分子的思想改造，促进知识分子与工农群众相结合。二、群众性。科协全国会员现已有六百万人，其中有大量的知识分子的科学技术人员，也有大量的工农创造发明家和技术革新、技术革命运动中的积极分子，经过他们又联系着广大群众。这就形成了遍布全国的群众性科学技术活动网。三、活动的广泛性和经常性。科协的业务范围，从科学研究、学术交流、干部培养、总结推广先进经验、普及科学知识以及国际活动等方面都有大量的工作。科协各级组织。同各地区、各有关单位都有广泛的联系。全国科协和各全国性自然科学专门学会并且有广泛的国际联系。而且非常重要的是，科协这些活动，是在广大群众中经常进行的，这就有更大的实际意义。科协这些特点使科协能够在科学技术力量的团结、发展和调动等方面，起到党的工具和助手的作用。
    中国科协在一九五九年总的任务是：在党的领导下，鼓足革命干劲，千方百计鼓舞科学技术工作者和广大群众的积极性，与有关方面密切合作，推进一个更加广阔更加深入的技术革新和技术革命的群众运动，大大提高我国的劳动生产率，为实现以钢、煤、粮、棉四大指标为中心的一九五九年国民经济建设计划而奋斗。
    中国科学技术的发展，必须注意吸收国际科学技术的成就。为此，中国科协还将加强与苏联和其他社会主义国家科学团体的联系，特别要加强对苏联先进科学技术的学习。中国科协还要积极支持世界科学工作者协会的工作，加强与各国际性科学团体的联系，加强反对试验核武器的斗争，为增进人类幸福、保卫世界和平而努力。
    各位代表、各位委员：中国科学技术协会对国家所作贡献还很少，科协工作还缺乏经验。请求各位代表、委员对我们的工作不断予以批评和监督。我们保证要在今后的工作中认真贯彻这次大会的决议，坚决依靠党的领导，密切结合生产，广泛、深入地开展群众性科学技术活动，为实现一九五九年国民经济计划作出应有的贡献。
