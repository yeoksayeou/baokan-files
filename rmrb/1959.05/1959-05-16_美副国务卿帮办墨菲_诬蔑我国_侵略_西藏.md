Xinhua News Agency, New York, 14th: U.S. Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Murphy, in a speech at Bellarmine College on the evening of the 13th, slandered China's suppression of the Tibetan rebellion as "military aggression against Tibet," and fabricated rumors, saying that China "treats innocent people with brutality."

Murphy distorted the facts, insisting that China's suppression of the Tibetan rebellion seemed to be a violation of the agreement on the peaceful liberation of Tibet and prevented Tibet from achieving "autonomy." He said that the Tibet incident "provides a standard example of the deceptive tactics commonly used by orthodox Communism. This orthodox Communism (referring to the Chinese Communist Party) once concluded a solemn agreement with the Dalai Lama, recognizing the traditional autonomy of the region."

In his speech, Murphy admitted the existence of a "close and powerful alliance" between China and the Soviet Union, and revealed his helpless sentiment towards this great alliance. He said that when China shelled Quemoy and Matsu, "Mr. Khrushchev immediately expressed Moscow's support for Peiping on this matter... It once again tested the free world's determination. This is one of a series of tests that I expect we will encounter from time to time."

    美副国务卿帮办墨菲
    诬蔑我国“侵略”西藏
    新华社14日讯  纽约消息：美国副国务卿帮办墨菲13日晚在贝拉明学院发表演说时，诬蔑中国平息西藏叛乱是“对西藏的军事侵略”，并造谣诽谤，说中国“以残暴态度对待无辜的人民”。
    墨菲歪曲事实，硬说中国平息西藏叛乱似乎是破坏了和平解放西藏地方的协议，是不让西藏“自治”。他说，西藏事件
  “提供了正统派共产主义所惯用的欺骗手法的标准例子。这个正统派共产主义（指中国共产党）曾经和达赖喇嘛缔结庄严的协议，承认这个地区的传统的自治”。
    墨菲在讲话中承认中国和苏联之间存在着“紧密和强大的联盟”，并流露出他对这一伟大联盟的无可奈何的心情。他说，中国炮击金门马祖时，“赫鲁晓夫先生马上就表示在这件事情上莫斯科支持北平……它又一次考验了自由世界的决心。这是我预料我们不时会遇到的一系列考验中的一次。”
