Xinhua News Agency, 10th: The Soviet motorcycle team, with rich competition experience, gave a motorcycle ring road speed performance for more than five thousand Chinese spectators in Beijing today. More than thirty male and female motorcycle athletes from our country also participated in the performance.

The performance was conducted on a five-kilometer-long designated ring track at Nanyuan Airport. Today, five athletes from the Soviet motorcycle team participated in the performance. They drove two-wheeled motorcycles with different cylinder volumes. Each of them was skilled, and they sped forward quickly after starting. Even when turning, they could maintain a fast speed. Soviet motorcycle cross-country race three-time champion and athlete Bratich drove the two-wheeled motorcycle with the largest cylinder volume (500 cubic centimeters) today. He was the fastest, completing the 75-kilometer-long full distance in 51 minutes and 18.1 seconds, with an average speed of more than 87 kilometers per hour.

The 75-kilometer full distance requires circling the ring track fifteen times, and each lap must pass through eight left turns, right turns, and right-angle turns. Soviet ring road race multiple champion and athlete Panfeolov was the fastest among the drivers of 125 cubic centimeter motorcycles today. He finished the 75 kilometers in 55 minutes and 25 seconds.

Vice Chairman Cheng Qian and Vice Premier Bo Yibo attended the performance today and met with the athletes from both sides after the performance.

The Soviet motorcycle team is scheduled to hold a motorcycle cross-country speed performance in Beijing on May 17.
