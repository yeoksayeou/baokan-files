Introduction of Marxist-Leninist Classics Before and After the May Fourth Movement

The Earliest Introductions of Marxist Works

At the beginning of the twentieth century, some bourgeois and petty-bourgeois intellectuals in China came into contact with socialist ideas while learning from the West, and occasionally mentioned Marx and Engels in their publications. In 1906, "Min Bao," the organ of the Tongmenghui published in Tokyo, Japan, published an article entitled "A Brief Biography of German Social Revolutionaries," introducing the life of Marx and Engels, and excerpting several paragraphs from the "Communist Manifesto." In 1907, the anarchist publication "Tianyi Bao," published in Tokyo, excerpted Engels' "The Origin of the Family, Private Property and the State." In 1912, the "New World" magazine in Shanghai serialized a part of Engels' "Socialism: Utopian and Scientific." However, these translations were not only too brief, but also contained many misunderstandings. Therefore, before the October Revolution, Chinese people did not understand Marxism, and many intellectuals did not even know Marx and Engels.

"New Youth's" "Special Issue on Marxist Research"

"The salvoes of the October Revolution brought us Marxism-Leninism." (Chairman Mao: "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship"). While cheering and yearning for the October Revolution, China's advanced intellectuals quickly accepted Marxism-Leninism. The May Fourth Movement, which occurred under the influence of the October Revolution, accelerated the spread of Marxism-Leninism in China. In 1919, the year the May Fourth Movement occurred, various progressive publications began to translate and publish the works of Marx and Engels, and publish articles on Marxism.

On the eve of the May Fourth Movement, the sixteenth issue of the progressive publication "Weekly Review" in Beijing (April 6, 1919) published a translated excerpt from the "Communist Manifesto." This translation excerpted the last section of the second chapter of the "Manifesto," that is, some particularly important paragraphs concerning the dictatorship of the proletariat and the ten-point program of the proletarian revolution. The "National" magazine, Volume 2, Number 1, published on November 1 of the same year, also translated and published the first chapter of the "Communist Manifesto," "Bourgeois and Proletarians."

The fifth issue of the sixth volume of "New Youth," published in the month of the May Fourth Movement, was the "Special Issue on Marxist Research." Comrade Li Dazhao published "My View of Marxism" in this issue. In addition to a general introduction to the Marxist materialist conception of history, class struggle, and political economy, this article excerpted several main passages related to historical materialism from the books "The Poverty of Philosophy," "Communist Manifesto," and "A Critique of Political Economy."

"Marx Study" Column in "Morning Post"

With the help of Comrade Li Dazhao, the supplement of the "Morning Post" in Beijing also published many articles on Marxism before and after the May Fourth Movement. The "Morning Post" compiled a special issue for the "Labor Day Commemoration" on May 1, 1919, which was the first time a Chinese newspaper commemorated this great festival of the working people of the world. From May 5, 1919, the 101st anniversary of Marx's birth, the supplement of the "Morning Post" opened the "Marx Study" column. From May 9 to June 1, Marx's "Labor and Capital" was serialized, which was the earliest Chinese translation of the book "Wage Labour and Capital." From June 2 to November 11, the famous popular Marxist work, Kautsky's "Explanation of Marx's Capital" (i.e., "The Economic Doctrine of Marx") was serialized in full. From May 5 to 8, "Marx's Materialist Conception of History" by the famous Japanese Marxist economist Kawakami Hajime was published. In this article, the famous passage on historical materialism from Marx's "Preface to 'A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy'" was translated and published. In addition, the supplement of the "Morning Post" published the "Declaration of the First Congress of the Third International" under the title "New Communist Manifesto" in August 1919, and also published biographies of Marx and Lenin twice in the same year. These translations published before and after the May Fourth Movement undoubtedly helped Chinese advanced intellectuals begin to initially accept Marxism.

The Complete Translation of the "Communist Manifesto"

The first complete Chinese translation of the "Communist Manifesto" (translated by Chen Wangdao) was published in April 1920, the second year of the May Fourth Movement. Less than half a year after the book was printed, the second edition was published in September of the same year. This shows the situation that progressive people in China at that time were eager to accept Marxism. This book was later reprinted many times by Guangzhou People's Publishing House, Pingmin Bookstore, Shanghai Bookstore, Guoguang Bookstore, and other places.

In May 1920, communist groups were successively established in Beijing, Wuhan, Changsha, Jinan, and Hangzhou. Since then, the spread of Marxism has become wider and deeper. In the short period of more than a year before the founding of the Communist Party of China in July 1921, more than a dozen Marxist-Leninist classics had been translated into Chinese. The works of Lenin, the great teacher of the worldwide proletarian revolution, also began to circulate in China at this time.

Translations of Other Works by Marx, Engels, and Lenin

From 1920 to before the founding of the Communist Party of China in July 1921, the works of Marx and Engels translated were:

"Capital: Preface to the First German Edition" (i.e., "Preface to the First German Edition of the First Volume of 'Capital'", published in the "National" monthly, Volume 2, Number 3, October 1920);

"Scientific Socialism and the Materialist Conception of History" (excerpted from a part of the third part of Engels' "Anti-Dühring," published in the "Construction" magazine, Volume 3, Number 1, December 1920);

"Marx's Materialist Conception of History" (i.e., the part on historical materialism in the "Preface to 'A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy'", published in the "Eastern Miscellany," Volume 18, Number 1, January 1921).

In addition, the Shanghai Qunyi Bookstore published the book "Scientific Socialism" in 1920 (i.e., the third chapter of Engels' "Socialism: Utopian and Scientific").

The works of Lenin published before July 1921 included:

"National Self-Determination" (i.e., a part of Lenin's "Report on the Party Program" at the Eighth Congress of the Russian Communist Party, published in the "New Youth" monthly, Volume 8, Number 3, November 1, 1920).

"Russia's New Problems" (i.e., a part of the Central Committee's report by Lenin at the Ninth Congress of the Russian Communist Party, published in the "Communist Party" monthly, Number 1, November 7, 1920);

"Renewing the Old System" (i.e., "From Destroying the Old System to Creating a New System," published in the "Dawn" magazine, Volume 1, Number 6, 1920); "Lenin's Remarks on the Emancipation of Russian Women" (i.e., a partial translation of "A Great Beginning," published in "Young World," Volume 1, Issue 7, 1920);

"The Economy of the Transition Period" (i.e., "Economics and Politics in the Era of the Dictatorship of the Proletariat," published in "New Youth," Volume 8, Number 4, December 1, 1920, and "Dawn" magazine, Volume 2, Number 1, 1920);

"Lenin's Speech at the Third Congress of the All-Russian Economic Committee" (i.e., "Speech at the Third All-Russian National Economic Council Congress," published in "Dawn" magazine, Volume 2, Number 1, 1920);

A part of the first chapter of "State and Revolution" (published in the "Communist Party" monthly, Number 4, May 7, 1921), etc.

In addition, the "Communist Party" monthly, Number 3, published Lenin's "Conditions for Admission to the Communist International" (originally titled "Conditions for Admission to the Third International Congress"), drafted for the Second Congress of the Communist International, and Number 1 also published materials such as "The History of Lenin," "For Lenin," and "A List of Lenin's Works." Articles related to the establishment of the Communist International and other communist parties occupied a large space in this publication, many of which quoted Lenin's words. During this period, the works of Lenin and materials related to Lenin's life and career published in newspapers and periodicals in various places played a great role in the development of communist groups in various places and the founding of the Communist Party of China.

Publication of the "New Youth Series"

During this period, the "New Youth Society" also published eight "New Youth Series" books, mainly works explaining and introducing Marxism. For example: Marcy's "Introduction to Marx's Capital," Kautsky's "The Class Struggle" (translated by Yun Daiying), Kkaapu's "History of Socialism," etc.

These Marxist-Leninist works and related materials published successively before and after the May Fourth Movement armed China's advanced intellectuals. This group of intellectuals with preliminary communist ideas were determined to combine with the working class and carried out extensive propaganda work of Marxism-Leninism among the broad masses of workers, preparing the necessary conditions for the establishment of the Communist Party of China.

    五四运动前后
    对马克思列宁主义经典著作的介绍
    马克思主义著作最早的介绍
    二十世纪初，中国一部分资产阶级和小资产阶级的知识分子在向西方学习的时候，也曾接触到社会主义思潮，并且也曾在他们出版的刊物上偶尔谈到过马克思和恩格斯。1906年在日本东京出版的同盟会机关报“民报”，曾发表了“德意志社会革命家小传”一文，介绍马克思和恩格斯的生平，并节译“共产党宣言”的几段。1907年在东京出版的无政府主义刊物“天义报”曾节译了恩格斯的“家族、私有制和国家的起源”。1912年上海“新世界”杂志也曾分期连载了恩格斯的“社会主义从空想到科学的发展”的一部分。但是，这些译文不仅过于简略，而且还有不少的误解。因此，在十月革命以前，中国人是不理解马克思主义的，在很多知识分子中甚至还不知道马克思和恩格斯。
    新青年的“马克思主义研究专号”
    “十月革命一声炮响，给我们送来了马克思列宁主义”（毛主席：“论人民民主专政”）。中国的先进知识分子在欢呼和向往十月革命的同时，很快地接受了马克思列宁主义。在十月革命的影响下发生的五四运动，加速了马克思列宁主义在中国的传播。五四运动发生的那一年（1919年），各种进步刊物开始陆续译载了马克思、恩格斯的著作，发表了有关马克思主义的文章。
    五四运动前夕，北京的进步刊物“每周评论”第十六号（1919年4月6日），刊载了“共产党宣言”的一段译文。这篇译文摘译了“宣言”第二章的最后一节，即有关无产阶级专政、无产阶级革命的十大纲领等特别重要的几段。同年11月1日出版的“国民”杂志第二卷第一号也译载了“共产党宣言”的第一章“资产者与无产者”。
    在五四运动爆发那一个月出版的“新青年”六卷五号，便是“马克思主义研究专号”。李大钊同志在这一号上发表了“我的马克思主义观”。这篇文章除一般介绍了马克思主义的唯物史观、阶级斗争和政治经济学外，并节译了“哲学的贫困”、“共产党宣言”、“政治经济学批判”三书中有关历史唯物主义的几个主要片断。
    晨报的“马克思研究”专栏
    北京的“晨报”副刊也在李大钊同志的帮助下，在五四运动前后发表了许多有关马克思主义的文章。“晨报”1919年5月1日编出了“劳动节纪念”专号，这是中国报纸第一次纪念这个全世界劳动人民的伟大节日。从1919年5月5日，即马克思诞生一百零一周年纪念日起，“晨报”副刊开辟了“马克思研究”专栏。5月9日——6月1日连载了马克思的“劳动与资本”，这是“雇佣劳动与资本”一书的最早的中译文。6月2日——11月11日连载了著名的马克思主义通俗作品——考茨基的“马氏资本论释义”全译（即“马克思的经济学说”）。5月5日——8日刊载了日本著名的马克思主义经济学家河上肇的“马克思的唯物史观”。在这篇文章中，译载了马克思的著名的“‘政治经济学批判’一书序言”中论述历史唯物主义的部分。此外，“晨报”副刊曾在1919年8月以“新共产党宣言”为题发表了“第三国际第一次代表大会的宣言”，也在这一年曾两次刊载了马克思和列宁的传记。五四运动前后发表的这些译著，无疑地帮助了中国先进知识分子开始初步接受马克思主义。
    “共产党宣言”的全译本
    “共产党宣言”的第一个中文全译本（陈望道译），是在五四运动的第二年——1920年4月问世的。这一本书印出后，不到半年的时间，即在同年9月又出了第二版。这可以说明当时中国进步人士渴望接受马克思主义的情况。此书后来又由广州人民出版社、平民书社、上海书店、国光书店等处翻印多次。
    1920年5月，北京、武汉、长沙、济南、杭州各地相继成立了共产主义小组。从此，马克思主义的传播就更广泛、更深入了。到1921年7月中国共产党成立前的短短一年多的时间，就有十几种马克思列宁主义经典著作译成了中文。伟大的全世界无产阶级革命导师列宁的著作，也是在这时开始流传中国的。
    马克思、恩格斯、列宁其他著作的翻译
    从1920年到1921年7月中国共产党成立以前译出的马克思和恩格斯的著作有：
    “资本论自叙”（即“‘资本论’第一卷德文初版序言”，载1920年10月“国民”月刊第二卷第三号）；
    “科学的社会主义与唯物史观”（摘译恩格斯的“反杜林论”第三编的一部分，载1920年12月“建设”杂志三卷一号）；
    “马克思的唯物史观”（即“‘政治经济学批判’一书序言”中有关历史唯物主义部分，载1921年1月“东方杂志”十八卷一号）。
    此外，1920年上海群益书社出版了“科学的社会主义”一书（即恩格斯的“社会主义从空想到科学的发展”的第三章）。
    在1921年7月以前发表的列宁著作有：
    “民族自决”（即列宁在俄共第八次代表大会上“关于党纲的报告”的一部分，载1920年11月1日“新青年”月刊八卷三号）。
    “俄罗斯的新问题”（即列宁在俄共第九次代表大会上中央委员会的报告的一部分，载“1920年11月7日共产党”月刊第一号）；
    “旧制更新”（即“从破坏历来的旧制度到创造新制度”，载1920年“曙光”杂志第一卷六号）；“列宁对俄罗斯妇女解放的言论”（即“伟大的创举”中的部分译文，载1920年“少年世界”一卷七期）；
    “过渡时代的经济”（即“无产阶级专政时期的经济和政治”，载1920年12月1日“新青年”八卷四号和1920年“曙光”杂志二卷一号）；
   “全俄经济委员会第三次代表大会上列宁之演说”（即“在全俄国民经济委员会第三次代表大会上的讲话”，载1920年“曙光”杂志二卷一号）；
    “国家与革命”的第一章的一部分（载1921年5月7日“共产党”月刊第四号）等。
    此外，“共产党”月刊第三号发表了列宁为共产国际第二次代表大会起草的“加入共产国际的条件”（原题为“加入第三次国际大会的条件”），第一号还登载了“列宁的历史”、“为列宁”、“列宁的著作一览表”等材料。共产国际和其他各国共产党成立的有关文章，在这个刊物占了很大篇幅，其中有很多地方引述了列宁的话。这一时期在各地报刊上发表的列宁著作及有关列宁生平事业的材料，对于各地共产主义小组的发展和中国共产党的成立起了很大的作用。
    “新青年丛书”的出版
    在这时期，“新青年社”还出版了八本“新青年丛书”，其中主要是解释和介绍马克思主义的著作。例如：马尔西的“马克思资本论入门”、考茨基的“阶级斗争”（恽代英译）、克卡朴的“社会主义史”等。
    这些在五四运动前后陆续发表的马克思列宁主义著作和有关材料，武装了中国的先进知识分子。这一批初步具有共产主义思想的知识分子，决心与工人阶级相结合，在广大的工人群众中进行了马克思列宁主义的广泛的宣传工作，为中国共产党的建立准备了必要的条件。
