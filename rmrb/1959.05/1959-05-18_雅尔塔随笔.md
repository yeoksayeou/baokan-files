    Yalta Sketches
    Wu Tinggen
    Not long ago, we made a trip to Yalta. Although it was only for a few days, this beautiful place has left us with unforgettable impressions.

    One morning in early April, we flew from Moscow's Vnukovo Airport to the Crimean Peninsula in southern Soviet Union. Yalta is located on this peninsula. It is backed by mountains and faces the sea. The plane could not fly directly there and had to land in Simferopol, the largest city in Crimea. At the Simferopol airport, we saw a helicopter, which was said to be flying to Yalta, because helicopters have no problem with towering mountains. In order to better appreciate the beautiful mountains and rivers, we did not take the helicopter but took a car along the highway instead.

    The Crimean Peninsula extends into the Black Sea, and the coast is mostly a seaside resort with a mild climate and pleasant scenery. In the decades since the October Revolution, the Soviet government has built countless sanatoriums on the coast for the vast number of working people to recuperate. As the car passed by, we could see slogans like: "The people have the right to work, the people have the right to rest."

    After driving about halfway, the car passed the Kutuzov Fountain. From the 13th to the 15th centuries, Crimea was invaded by foreign powers such as Turkey. In 1774, the famous Russian general Kutuzov (then a young lieutenant colonel) defeated the Turkish army here. Later generations erected his statue on the ancient battlefield and built a fountain. The place was then named Kutuzovka in commemoration.

    When we were about to reach Yalta, the car passed Massandra, where there is a large-scale winery. Crimea is rich in grapes, and the plains and hillsides along the highway are full of grape trellises. Unfortunately, we didn't come at the right time. If it were in the late summer and early autumn, the mountains and fields would be covered with grapes of various colors, making the peninsula even more beautiful. In addition to being used as fruit for consumption, grapes are mostly used for winemaking. The wine produced here is very famous. Due to the mild climate, the vegetation in southern Crimea is very lush, with more than 2,000 species, hence the name "Green Treasure House."

    In the dim twilight, we arrived in Yalta.

    As soon as you come into contact with this city, you will be attracted by its beauty and elegance. It is not like a bustling metropolis, with tall buildings and noisy shops, but it is a very good place to live and recuperate. The population here is not large, only about 50,000 people, and the residences are two-story villas. Each house has a small courtyard in front, and hundreds of flowers are in bloom. Walking on the street, both sides are lined with flowers, sending out bursts of fragrance to tourists with the gentle sea breeze. The whole city is like a large garden.

    The seaside is a neat and wide road, which is the most popular place for tourists. Hotels, restaurants, and department stores are mostly located here. We saw workers decorating the outdoor restaurants and cold food stores, preparing to welcome summer tourists. The swimming season here is very long, from May to October. During this period, the weather is hot, and people can swim in the Black Sea. Outside the stone railing of the seaside road is the vast Black Sea. Many small yachts are moored at the dock for people to cruise on the sea. In addition, large passenger ships often travel between Odessa and Sevastopol. People come to Yalta for recuperation and sightseeing all year round. Sanatoriums and hotels are often full. With the development of communist construction, the lives of the Soviet people are getting better and better, and everyone has the opportunity to rest and recuperate. This small city with a population of 50,000 receives as many as 500,000 people for recuperation and sightseeing every year.

    Yalta has left the footprints of many writers and poets. The great poet Pushkin, the writer Leo Tolstoy, and Gorky have all been here more than once. Mayakovsky even wrote poems praising this place. Chekhov's former residence in Yalta is now open to tourists as a museum. From 1899, Chekhov came to this small city to recuperate from lung disease and lived here until May 1, 1904. Due to the aggravation of lung disease, he passed away in a sanatorium in Germany two months later (July 2). Many of Chekhov's works were written in his residence in Yalta. His friends Gorky, Stanislavsky, Danchenko, and Levitan all visited this house. The mistress of the house—Chekhov's wife—passed away not long before our visit to the former residence (March 21 this year).

    Not far from Yalta, there is a magnificent building surrounded by lush trees and a very beautiful environment. It is the summer palace of Tsar Nicholas II. After the October Revolution, the Soviet government turned it into a sanatorium for collective farm members. In February 1945, Comrade Stalin, Roosevelt, and Churchill held talks here and signed the famous Yalta Agreement. According to the agreement, the Soviet Union immediately declared war on Japan after achieving a complete victory over fascist Germany, crushed the Japanese invading army in Northeast China, and forced Japan to surrender unconditionally. We visited this Tsar's summer palace in the bright spring sunshine. It was very quiet inside, as the people who were recuperating were sound asleep during their afternoon nap.

    The several days of travel in Yalta made us deeply feel that under the people's regime, the working people are the true masters of the country, and people are creating a happy and fulfilling life with their own hands.

    雅尔塔随笔
    伍廷根
    不久以前，我们曾有一次雅尔塔之行，虽然只有短短几天，但这个美丽的地方已给我们留下难忘的印象。
    4月初的一天早晨，我们从莫斯科的伏努科夫机场乘飞机前往苏联南部的克里米亚半岛，雅尔塔就在这个半岛上。它背山面海，飞机不能直达，只能飞到克里米亚的第一大城西姆菲罗波尔。在西姆菲罗波尔的机场上，我们看到一架直升飞机，据说是飞往雅尔塔的，因为丛山峻岭难不住直升飞机。为了更好地欣赏明秀的山川，我们没有乘直升飞机，却坐上汽车沿公路进发。
    克里米亚半岛伸入黑海，沿岸大都是气候温和，景色宜人的海滨疗养地。十月革命以后几十年来，苏联政府在海岸边上修建了无数的疗养所，供广大的劳动人民来此休养。汽车过处，不时可以看到这样的标语：“人民有劳动的权利，人民有休息的权利。”
    约走了一半路程，汽车经过库图佐夫喷泉。从十三世纪到十五世纪，克里米亚曾被土耳其等外族入侵，1774年俄国名将库图佐夫（当时还是一个年轻的中校），大败土耳其军队于此。后人在古战场上立下他的雕像，修了一个喷泉，该地即称为库图佐夫卡以作纪念。
    快到雅尔塔的时候，汽车经过马山得拉，这里有一座规模很大的葡萄酒厂。克里米亚盛产葡萄，公路旁边的平地和山坡上尽是葡萄架子。可惜我们来得不是时候，如果是在夏末秋初的季节，漫山遍野都将结满各种颜色的葡萄，使半岛变得更加美丽。除了作水果供食用外，葡萄多用来酿酒，这里出产的葡萄酒是很有名的。由于气候温和，克里米亚南部的植物非常繁茂，种类之多竟达两千种以上，因而有“绿色宝库”之称。
    在苍黄的暮色中，我们来到了雅尔塔。
    只要一和这城市接触，马上就会被它的优美和雅静所吸引。它不像繁华的都会，没有高楼大厦，没有喧嚣的市廛，但却是非常好的居停、休养的胜地。这里人口不多，约只有五万人，人们的住宅是一座座两层的小洋房。房子前面都有一个小庭院，百花正在开放。走在街上，夹道都是鲜花，随着习习的海风向游人散发出阵阵的香气，整个城市就像是一座大花园。
    海边是一条整齐宽阔的马路，这是游人最多的地方，旅馆，餐厅，百货店多设在这里。我们看见工人们在修饰露天餐厅和冷食店，准备迎接夏天的游客。这里的游泳季节很长，从5月到10月。在这段时间里，天气较热，人们可以在黑海边作海水浴。海滨马路的石栏外就是烟波浩渺的黑海。码头上停着许多小游艇，供人们到海上遨游，此外还有大客轮常来往于敖得萨、西瓦斯托波尔之间。来雅尔塔休养、游览的人终年不断。休养所和旅馆经常人满。随着共产主义建设的发展，苏联人民的生活日益美好，人人都有休息、疗养的机会。这座五万人口的小城市每年接待休养、游览的人竟达五十万之多。
    雅尔塔曾留下许多作家和诗人的足迹。大诗人普希金，作家列夫·托尔斯泰，高尔基等人都不止一次地到过这里，马雅可夫斯基还写下了称赞这地方的诗篇。契呵夫在雅尔塔的故居，现在已作为博物馆向游人开放。从1899年起，契呵夫到这小城来疗养肺病，一直住到1904年5月1日才离去。由于肺病的加重，他在两个月之后，（7月2日）就在德国的一个疗养地逝世了。契呵夫的许多作品都是在雅尔塔的住所里写成的。他的朋友高尔基，斯坦尼斯拉夫斯基、丹钦科、列维坦等都曾在这房子里作客。房子的女主人——契呵夫的妻子在我们访问故居前不久（今年3月21日）去世。
    离雅尔塔不远有一座华丽的建筑物，周围绿树成荫，环境非常优美，那是沙皇尼古拉二世的夏宫。十月革命后苏维埃政府将它改为集体农庄庄员的休养所。1945年2月斯大林同志与罗斯福、丘吉尔在这里举行了会谈，并签订了著名的雅尔塔协定。根据协定，苏联在取得对法西斯德国的彻底胜利后立即向日本宣战，在我国东北粉碎了日本侵略军，迫使日本无条件投降。我们在明媚的春光里参观了这座沙皇的夏宫。里面一片寂静，原来休养者们午睡正酣呢。
    雅尔塔的数日遨游，使我们深深感到在人民的政权下，劳动人民是国家真正的主人，人们正在用双手创造着幸福、美满的生活。
