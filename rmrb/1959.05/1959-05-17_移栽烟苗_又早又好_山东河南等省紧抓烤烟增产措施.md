Transplanting Tobacco Seedlings Early and Well
Shandong, Henan and Other Provinces Intensify Measures to Increase Burley Tobacco Production

Jinan, May 16 (This newspaper reports) People's communes in burley tobacco producing areas of Shandong Province are actively preparing to transplant spring tobacco. This year, tobacco farmers in the Changwei and Jining regions of Shandong Province have adopted advanced techniques such as warm beds and heated brick beds to cultivate lush tobacco seedlings on tens of thousands of mu of spring tobacco. Some seedlings already have five or six true leaves. Most of the stubble tobacco seedlings cultivated in various places have also sprouted. At present, the majority of tobacco farmers are stepping up land preparation and ridge building in preparation for early transplanting.

This year, Shandong Province plans to plant 1.3 million mu of burley tobacco, an increase of 20,000 mu compared to last year's harvested area. The yield per unit area of burley tobacco is also expected to increase significantly compared to last year. In organizing burley tobacco production, the Communist Party committees at all levels in tobacco producing areas first signed pre-purchase contracts with tobacco farmers in conjunction with the people's communes' contracting work and output, and arranged the plans for planting burley tobacco and various measures to ensure increased production to production teams or groups as early as possible, so that the production plans were implemented and rooted. Therefore, people's communes in various places are grasping the important measures to increase production, such as spring irrigation, plowing, increasing the application of base fertilizer, and promoting nutrient soil seedling cultivation, based on the experience of large-scale burley tobacco yield increases last year.

In order to help tobacco farmers increase the yield per unit area of burley tobacco, in addition to supplying another ten catties of chemical fertilizer per mu of tobacco land, the Shandong agricultural and commercial departments also issued more than 10 million yuan in advance payment through the signing of pre-purchase contracts.

Zhengzhou, May 16 (This newspaper reports) In Henan Province's burley tobacco producing areas, 900,000 mu of early tobacco has been basically transplanted before "Lixia" (Beginning of Summer), one season earlier than in previous years. The transplanted tobacco seedlings are plump and large, with a high survival rate. This is a new phenomenon in burley tobacco production after the people's communes were established. At present, the tobacco areas are inspecting and replanting seedlings, and strengthening field management.

In Xuchang Prefecture, a famous burley tobacco producing area in Henan, the tobacco seedling cultivation period this year was generally half a month earlier than usual. In order to prevent wind, frost, and freezing damage, more than 38,000 mu of seedbeds in the entire prefecture were equipped with wind protection and warming equipment.

This year, the people's communes here planting burley tobacco have also implemented the "Eight-Character Charter" for agricultural production in accordance with local conditions, based on last year's burley tobacco bumper harvest experience. This year's 800,000 mu of early tobacco in Xuchang Prefecture applied an average of 10,000 catties of base fertilizer per mu, plowed deeply to about one foot, and the number of transplanted plants per mu was also densely planted from 1,500 plants last year to 2,000 plants. In order to eliminate waterlogging and drought disasters, most of the tobacco fields here have been converted into garden fields, achieving the requirements of being able to irrigate in drought and drain in waterlogging.

Kunming, May 16 (This newspaper reports) Yunnan's highly regarded burley tobacco has begun to be planted. The early arrival of the continuous rainy season is urging people to start early. In the misty rain, tens of thousands of tobacco farmers across the province are busily engaged in land preparation, fertilization, and transplanting in the river valleys and plains. More than 10,000 tobacco curing barns throughout the province have also been renovated in advance before the rainy season and the fuel for curing tobacco has been prepared.

Yunnan plans to plant more than 600,000 mu of burley tobacco this year. Although the area is slightly smaller than last year, the yield per unit area is striving to be doubled, so that the total output will still be significantly higher than last year. In order to achieve this plan, tobacco farmers of all ethnic groups in the province's communes are using better irrigated land to grow burley tobacco, and have prepared enough high-quality base fertilizer for burley tobacco. The high-yield fields, which account for 30% of the total area, are even more carefully cultivated, with better land preparation and fertilization than in previous years.

After sowing, various tobacco areas carried out a lot of work to prevent and resist natural disasters. This year, the tobacco seedlings here were hit by heavy snow, hail, and pests and diseases that have not been seen for decades. Many tobacco areas have taken various measures to fight against disasters. In Yuxi Prefecture, which accounts for one-third of the province's burley tobacco area, replanting was carried out in many places in a timely manner. At present, more than 20,000 mu of tobacco seedlings throughout the province are already five inches high, with four or five leaves, and are growing vigorously.

Yunnan burley tobacco is one of the best burley tobaccos in the country. The tobacco leaves cured with Yunnan burley tobacco leaves are golden in color, bright in luster, and have a distinct fragrance. The sugar content in the tobacco leaves is the highest among burley tobaccos in the country, and the nicotine content is neither too much nor too little, meeting the standards. It is the main raw material in the blending of high-grade cigarettes such as Zhonghua brand. (Tian Lianggeng)

Guiyang, May 16 (This newspaper reports) Tobacco farmers of all ethnic groups in Guizhou Province, one of the main burley tobacco producing areas in our country, are seizing the current suitable season to transplant tobacco seedlings quickly and well. By early May, nearly 40,000 mu of burley tobacco had been transplanted. After inspection and acceptance, the transplanted tobacco seedlings are growing strong, green and in rows, with a survival rate of over 95%.

Burley tobacco is one of the most important economic crops in Guizhou Province. This year, the province plans to expand the planting area to one million mu, and the yield per unit area is also required to be much higher than last year.

The burley tobacco bumper harvest experience here proves that early transplanting of burley tobacco not only makes it easier for seedlings to survive, and can mature and be harvested early, ensuring the quality of tobacco leaves, but also does not delay rice transplanting. This year, tobacco farmers here have grasped the four key aspects of "early, dense, fast, and good" from mid-April, and have rushed to transplant tobacco seedlings half a month earlier than in previous years. This year, some places have adopted the method of assembly line operation, which improves work efficiency by 30%-50%, when planting tobacco, with four or five people operating separately, digging holes, applying base fertilizer, planting tobacco, and watering manure at the same time.

    移栽烟苗　又早又好
    山东河南等省紧抓烤烟增产措施
    本报济南16日电　山东省各烤烟产区的人民公社，正积极准备移栽春烟。今年山东省昌潍、济宁专区的烟农们，采取温床、火炕等先进经验为十万亩春烟培育的烟苗畦畦枝叶茂盛，有的已长出五、六个真叶。各地畦育的麦茬烟苗，大部分也已破土抽芽。目前，广大烟农正加紧整地、修畦，准备提前移栽。
    今年山东省计划种植烤烟一百三十万亩，比去年收获面积扩大二万亩，烤烟的单位面积产量也要比去年有很大增加。各产烟地区的中共党委在组织烤烟生产中，首先结合人民公社的包工、包产同烟农们签订了预购合同，把种植烤烟的计划和保证增产的各项措施，都及早安排到生产队或小组，使生产计划落实扎根。因此各地人民公社都根据去年许多大面积烤烟增产的经验，抓紧进行春灌、翻地、增施底肥、推广营养土育苗等重要增产措施。
    为了帮助烟农提高烤烟单位面积产量，山东农业和商业部门除每亩烟田另外供应十斤化学肥料外，还通过签订预购合同，发放预订金一千多万元。　（王换吾）
    本报郑州16日电　河南省烤烟产区九十万亩早烟，在“立夏”前已经基本移栽完毕，比往年提前了一个季节，移栽的烟苗又肥又大，成活率高，这是人民公社化后在烤烟生产上出现的新气象。目前，这里的各烟区正在查苗、补苗，加强田间管理。
    河南著名烤烟产地许昌专区，今年烟叶育苗期普遍提早半个月左右。为了防御风、霜、冻害侵袭，全专区三万八千多亩苗床都安置了防风保暖设备。
    今年这里的栽种烤烟的人民公社，根据去年烤烟丰产经验，还因地制宜地贯彻了农业生产“八字宪法”。许昌专区今年的八十万亩早烟，每亩平均施底肥一万斤，深翻一尺左右，移栽株数也由去年的每亩一千五百株，密植到两千株。为了消灭水旱灾害，这里的大部分烟田实现了园田化，达到了旱能浇、涝能排的要求。　（刘传勋）
    本报昆明16日电　富有声誉的云南烤烟开始栽种了。提早到来的绵绵雨季，催着人们早早动手。在蒙蒙细雨里，全省几万烟农正在河谷和平坝里，紧张地进行整地、施肥和移栽。全省一万多座烤房也提前在雨季前着手进行了整修和准备好了烤烟的燃料。
    云南今年计划种烤烟六十多万亩，面积虽比去年略有缩减，但单位面积产量力争成倍提高，使总产量较去年仍有较大增加。为了实现这个计划，全省各公社的各族烟农，都用较好的水流地来种烤烟，并为烤烟准备了足够的优质底肥。这里的占总面积30％的丰产田，更是精雕细琢，整地和施肥都比往年好。
    各烟区在播种以后进行了许多防抗自然灾害的工作。今年这里的烟苗受到数十年未有的大雪、冰雹和病虫害的侵袭。许多烟区采取了各种办法和灾害进行斗争。占全省烤烟面积三分之一的玉溪专区的很多地方，都及时进行了补种。目前，全省两万多亩烟苗，已有五寸高，四、五个叶片，生长得茁壮旺盛。
    云南烤烟是全国烤烟中最优良的一种。用云南烤烟叶烤出的烟叶，颜色金黄、光泽鲜明、有显著的清香，烟叶中含糖量是全国烤烟中含糖量最高的一种，尼古丁的含量不多也不少，合乎标准。它是制造中华牌等高级卷烟配料中的主要原料。　（田良耕）
    本报贵阳16日电　我国烤烟主要产区之一的贵州省的各族烟农，正在抓紧当前适宜季节，又快又好地移栽烟苗，到5月上旬，已移栽烤烟近四万亩。经过检查验收，移栽后的烟苗生长健壮，碧翠成行，成活率在95％以上。
    烤烟是贵州省最重要的经济作物之一，今年全省计划种植面积扩大到一百万亩，单产也要求比去年提高很多。
    这里的烤烟丰产经验证明，烤烟移栽的早，不但幼苗成活容易，可以早熟早收，保证烟叶质量，还能不误水稻插秧。今年这里的烟农，从4月中旬，就抓住“早、密、快、好”四个环节，比往年提早半个月抢栽烟苗。今年有些地方在栽烟的时候采取提高工效30％—50％的流水作业的办法，由四、五人分别操作，随打窝，随施底肥，随栽烟、淋粪。
