Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, May 13th - The Central Committee of the Vietnam Workers' Party, in a communiqué issued today regarding the Fifteenth Plenary Session (Enlarged) of the Central Committee, proposed the following tasks for the current struggle to the entire party and people:

"Unite all the people and strive to achieve the reunification of the motherland on the basis of independence and democracy; strive to consolidate the North and actively guide it towards socialism; build a peaceful, unified, independent, democratic, and prosperous Vietnam, and contribute to the defense of peace in Southeast Asia and the world."

The communiqué stated that the Fifteenth Session (Enlarged) of the Central Committee recently held believes that: The characteristic of the current situation in Vietnam is: "While North Vietnam is moving towards socialism, the tasks of the national and people's democratic revolution have not yet been completed throughout the country."

The communiqué pointed out that peace and reunification are the most urgent aspirations of all the people of Vietnam. For the supreme interests of the nation, the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam has always respected the Geneva Agreements and has consistently demonstrated a constructive attitude in implementing this agreement. On the other hand, U.S. imperialism and its lackeys in South Vietnam have deliberately and persistently divided Vietnam and prepared to launch a new war. To realize their heinous conspiracy, the U.S.-Ngo clique has intensified its arms expansion in the past few years, wantonly exploited the people, abolished all democratic freedoms, and brutally suppressed and persecuted the people. The U.S.-Ngo clique has made the economy of South Vietnam extremely dilapidated, and the lives of the South Vietnamese people are becoming increasingly impoverished and backward.

The communiqué stated: Just as the people of North Vietnam are vigorously building the socialist North, the people of South Vietnam are carrying forward the tradition of heroic struggle, resolutely opposing the brutal rule of the U.S.-Ngo clique, and demanding the peaceful reunification of the motherland. The U.S.-Ngo clique's policies of deceiving the people, sowing discord among ethnic groups, and barbaric persecution and slaughter cannot subdue the South Vietnamese people. On the contrary, the patriotic movement in South Vietnam will inevitably develop more widely and deeply.

The communiqué stated: "The conference expressed unparalleled anger at the countless disasters and sufferings brought to the people of South Vietnam by U.S. imperialism and its accomplices, and expressed warm praise for the indomitable spirit of unity and struggle of the people of South Vietnam."

The communiqué concluded that the conference is deeply convinced that the Vietnamese people will surely be able to crush the aggression of U.S. imperialism and the treasonous conspiracy of its accomplices. The cause of the reunification of the motherland will surely be successful.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, May 14th - The Vietnamese "People's Daily" published an editorial today saying that at a time when U.S. imperialism is increasingly intensifying its interference in South Vietnam and the Ngo Dinh Diem clique is increasingly frantically undermining the Geneva Agreements, the analysis of the situation made by the Fifteenth Plenary Session (Enlarged) of the Central Committee of the Vietnam Workers' Party and the instructions on strengthening the struggle for the unified motherland are of vital importance.

The editorial said that for more than four years, the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the Vietnamese people have made unremitting efforts to achieve the peaceful reunification of the motherland, but have achieved little as a result of the interference of U.S. imperialism and the obstruction of the South Vietnamese authorities.

The editorial analyzed the current social nature of South Vietnam, saying, "The current South Vietnamese society is a colonial and semi-feudal society." This social system is the main obstacle to the development of South Vietnamese society. The editorial pointed out that the fundamental contradiction in South Vietnam today is the contradiction between the vast majority of the people, including workers, peasants, petty bourgeoisie, national bourgeoisie, and all patriotic figures in the upper strata who support the reunification of the motherland on the basis of independence and democracy, and U.S. imperialism and the most reactionary pro-American feudal forces and comprador bourgeoisie. Only by resolving this fundamental contradiction can the national-people's democratic revolution be completed in South Vietnam, thereby establishing a peaceful, unified, independent, democratic, and prosperous Vietnam throughout the country.

The editorial pointed out that the current domestic and international situation is increasingly favorable to the Vietnamese people, but very unfavorable to imperialism and its running dogs.

The editorial said that the Vietnamese people have always cherished peace. They resolutely demand that the South Vietnamese authorities thoroughly implement the Geneva Agreements and unify the motherland through consultation and general elections. However, the Vietnamese people will absolutely not tolerate imperialism and feudal forces trapping their South Vietnamese compatriots in the circle of slavery. The Vietnamese people will use all necessary means and methods of struggle to achieve the goals of the revolution.

    越南劳动党中央向全党全民提出当前斗争任务
    努力巩固北方争取祖国和平统一
    坚决反对美国分裂越南和准备战争的恶毒阴谋
    新华社河内13日电　越南劳动党中央委员会在今天发表的第十五次中央委员会会议（扩大）的公报中，向全党全民提出了当前斗争的任务：
  “团结全体人民，努力奋斗，以便在独立、民主的基础上实现祖国的统一；努力巩固北方，积极引导北方向社会主义迈进；建设一个和平、统一、独立、民主和富强的越南，为保卫东南亚和世界的和平作出贡献”。
    公报说，劳动党中央委员会最近举行的第十五次会议（扩大）认为：越南“当前形势的特点是：当北越正在走向社会主义的时候，在全国范围内，民族和人民民主革命的任务还没有完成。”
    公报指出，和平、统一是越南全体人民当前最迫切的愿望。为了民族的最高利益，越南民主共和国政府始终尊重日内瓦协议，在履行这个协议时，一贯表现出建设性的态度。另一方面，美帝国主义及其南越的帮凶却故意长期分割越南和准备发动新战争。为了实现他们的恶毒阴谋，美吴集团在过去几年中加紧扩充军备，大肆剥削人民，取消一切民主自由权利，极其野蛮地镇压和迫害人民。美吴集团把南越的经济弄得雕敝不堪，南越人民的生活日益贫困和落后。
    公报说：正当北越人民大力建设社会主义的北方的时候，南越人民发扬了英勇斗争的传统，坚决反对美吴集团的残暴统治，要求和平统一祖国。美吴集团的欺骗人民、离间各民族团结以及野蛮的迫害、屠杀政策决不能使南越人民屈服，相反地，南越的爱国运动必将愈加广泛和深入地发展。
    公报说：“会议对美帝国主义及其帮凶给南越人民带来无数的灾难痛苦表示无比的愤怒，并对南越人民不屈不挠的团结斗争精神表示热烈的赞扬。”
    公报最后说，会议深信越南人民一定能够粉碎美帝国主义的侵略和它的帮凶的卖国阴谋。祖国的统一事业一定会获得成功。
    新华社河内14日电　越南“人民报”今天发表社论说，当美帝国主义日益加紧对南越进行干涉、吴庭艳集团日益疯狂地破坏日内瓦协议的时候，越南劳动党中央委员会第十五次会议
  （扩大）对局势作出的分析和关于加强统一祖国的斗争的指示具有十分重要的意义。
    社论说，四年多以来，越南民主共和国政府和越南人民为了争取实现祖国的和平统一做了不懈的努力，只是由于美帝国主义的干涉和南越当局的阻挠而没有得到什么结果。
    社论分析南越目前的社会性质说，“目前的南越社会是殖民地半封建的社会。”这种社会制度是南越社会发展的主要障碍。社论指出，南越目前的基本矛盾是工人、农民、小资产阶级、民族资产阶级和一切支持在独立民主的基础上统一祖国的上层爱国人士等绝大多数人民同美帝国主义以及最反动的亲美的封建势力和买办资产阶级之间的矛盾。只有解决了这个基本矛盾，才能在南越完成民族——人民民主革命，从而在全国范围内建立一个和平、统一、独立、民主和富强的越南。
    社论指出，当前的国内和国际局势越来越有利于越南人民，而非常不利于帝国主义和它的走狗。
    社论说，越南人民一贯爱好和平。他们坚决要求南越当局彻底履行日内瓦协议，并且通过协商和举行普选来统一祖国。但是，越南人民绝对不能容忍帝国主义和封建势力把南越同胞困在奴隶的圈子里。越南人民将用一切必要的斗争方式和方法来达到革命的目的。
