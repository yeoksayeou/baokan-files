Comrade Chairman, fellow delegates:

I agree with the reports made by Premier Zhou, Vice Premier Li Fuchun, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen respectively, and I firmly implement them.

I am an electric welder from the Guiyang Mining Machinery Factory in Guizhou Province. In the eight years since I joined the factory, my deepest feeling is about the great year of 1958. In this year, under the shining light of the Party's General Line, our factory's worker brothers unleashed soaring energy and creative talent. After a year of hard work, the entire factory's appearance underwent tremendous changes, and steel and machinery production achieved unprecedented bumper harvests. The total output value increased more than threefold compared to 1957, and the machines produced by the factory greatly exceeded the total output of the entire province in the decades before liberation. We produced nine new products, totaling two thousand one hundred and thirteen machines. Under conditions of limited equipment, lack of technical data, and weak technical capabilities, we produced a Soviet-style combined crusher and the first 250cm rolling mill in our province. At the same time, under the call of "taking steel as the key link and achieving overall leap forward," the entire factory launched a campaign to fight for steel. The Guiyang Mining Machinery Factory, which had never produced a single pound of steel, finally saw the flow of boiling steel water. From July to the end of last year, we produced more than 3,000 tons of steel for the country.

　　Energy plus Diligence, Everyone Contributes Brilliant Ideas, Everyone Compares Wisdom, Everyone Makes Innovations

The working class and laboring people under the leadership of the Party are the decisive factors in realizing the Great Leap Forward. After the great nationwide rectification movement, the ideological awareness of the entire factory's employees was greatly improved. In the third quarter of last year, when the higher-level Party committee instructed our factory to produce metallurgical equipment, cement equipment, and larger machine tools, it was very difficult for our factory, which had poor equipment and weak technology. Many workers had never seen what these devices looked like. At the time, some people said we were "dreaming." Under the leadership of the Party, employee representative meetings and group meetings were held in various workshops. Using the methods of free airing of views, big character posters, and in-depth discussions on issues such as "Can we complete the task?" and "How can we complete the task?", the understanding of the masses was further improved. Everyone made guarantees, and the 3,400 employees of the entire factory resolutely implemented the policy of self-reliance and the combination of foreign and indigenous methods. According to the Party's instructions, under the slogan of "Energy plus diligence, everyone contributes brilliant ideas, everyone compares wisdom, everyone makes innovations," a production upsurge centered on technical innovation was launched. Difficulties were overcome one by one, and new records continued to emerge. For example, in the manufacture of new products such as metallurgical and cement equipment, the "ants gnawing at bones" method was adopted to solve the difficulty of small equipment and large processing parts. The left and right "portal frames" of the 250cm rolling mill needed to be processed by a gantry planer, but our planer was small and the parts could not fit. Workers Qu Hegui and Chen Guoliang from the metalworking workshop erected a lathe face on the side of the planer, installed a tool holder, and used it as a lathe-arm gantry planer, thus successfully completing the processing. The casting workshop cast converter wind belts, each weighing more than four tons, but the factory's converter capacity was only one ton and could not be blown at one time. We divided the original part into four pieces for casting, and then welded them together, solving the problem of insufficient molten steel. The metalworking workshop processed the round holes of the converter wind belt. Due to the large size and weight of the wind belt, and the limitation of the workshop's production area and lifting equipment, it could not be processed on the workshop's radial drilling machine. Workers in the large planer team created a small "mobile drilling machine" to drill holes on the wind belt. In the production struggle to overcome all difficulties, the fighting spirit of the vast number of employees was enhanced, and workers who dared to innovate emerged one after another. Gao Wenqing, a young worker in the riveting and welding workshop, boldly improved the mold for producing parts for eliminated machines, turning the original manual operation into mechanization, increasing work efficiency by 1,072 times, and becoming a technical innovation pacesetter in the entire province. The entire factory's employees, like the employees of the entire province, immediately launched a campaign to learn from Gao Wenqing, catch up with Gao Wenqing, and surpass Gao Wenqing. Subsequently, four young people including Lan Tiefu and Bai Meijuan created the carbon dioxide molding method, increasing work efficiency by 2,800 times. Ren Wenxue from the tool workshop, under the leadership of the Party branch and with the help of experienced workers and technicians, worked hard for seven days and nights, and after more than 30 experiments, created a high-speed steel annealing method, increasing work efficiency by more than 170,000 times, breaking the superstition in books that rapid annealing was not possible. Last year, I also worked with my fellow workers to create an oxygen automatic cutting machine and a welding cylinder automatic turning fixture, solving the difficulties caused by the inability to buy them from foreign countries and affecting the completion of production tasks, and saving raw materials. After our factory implemented the "two participations, one reform, and three combinations" industrial constitution, the enthusiasm and creativity of the vast number of employees were further enhanced, and the sense of responsibility as masters was further strengthened. Last year, we revised 110 kinds of outdated rules and regulations that were not conducive to production and management, greatly promoting the in-depth development of production leap forward and technological revolution, forming a closer new relationship between leaders and the masses, cadres and workers, with everyone united and working together.

　　Following the victorious road of last year, create better achievements this year

1959 is a year of decisive significance for our country's three years of hard work, and it is also a year of greater leap forward. While cheering for the great achievements of 1958, the entire staff of our Guiyang Mining Machinery Factory deeply realized that the tasks they completed were still insufficient, there were still many shortcomings in their work, and there was still a great gap between the requirements of the Party and the needs of socialist construction. I am determined to follow the spirit indicated by Premier Zhou in the Government Work Report, and together with our entire factory staff, under the leadership of the Party, advance along the victorious road of 1958, and make new achievements for this year's greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward. According to the spirit of the Eighth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, our factory has formulated a plan for the entire year of this year, with the total output value increasing by more than double compared to 1958, and the output of major products this year is planned to increase by 1.7 times compared to 1958. In order to ensure the completion of this great and arduous task, since the beginning of spring, the entire factory staff has mustered greater energy and launched a vigorous production upsurge centered on technological revolution. With the active efforts of the vast number of employees in the entire factory, the first quarter plan has been successfully overfulfilled. At present, regardless of new workers or old workers, they are all drumming up their energy, adding energy on top of energy, using skill upon skill, and are creating greater value in a shorter time and with less manpower, manufacturing more mining, metallurgical, and cement equipment, supporting the large-scale industrial construction in various parts of the motherland and our Guizhou Province, and rapidly changing the backward industrial face of Guizhou Province. We must hold even higher the red flag of communist ideology, take out even greater energy, continue to break down superstitions, emancipate our minds, vigorously carry out the technological revolution, learn from advanced experiences, complete and overfulfill this year's state plan, make outstanding achievements, dedicate ourselves to the 10th anniversary of the National Day, and make contributions to our great motherland.

### 巧上加巧，生产更多的机器  王兴才代表的发言

　　巧上加巧，生产更多的机器
    王兴才代表的发言主席、各位代表：
    我同意周总理、李富春副总理、李先念副总理和彭真副委员长分别作的报告，并坚决贯彻执行。
    我是贵州省贵阳矿山机器厂的电焊工人，进厂八年来，我感受最深刻的是伟大的一九五八年。这一年中，我们工厂的工人兄弟在党的总路线光辉照耀下，发挥了冲天干劲和创造才能，经过一年的苦战，使全厂面貌发生了巨大的变化，钢铁和机械生产获得了空前的丰收。总产值在一九五七年的基础上增加了两倍多，全厂所生产的机器，大大超过解放前全省几十年的总和。生产了九种新产品，二千一百一十三台机器。在设备小，技术资料缺乏，技术力量薄弱的情况下，生产了仿苏式联合破碎机和我省第一台二百五十厘米轧钢机。同时，在“以钢为纲，全面跃进”的号召下，全厂职工掀起了为钢而战的运动，在历来没有生产一斤钢的贵阳矿山机器厂终于流出沸腾的钢水，去年七月到年底为国家生产了三千多吨钢。
    干劲加钻劲　人人献妙计  个个比智慧　大家闹革新
    在党领导下的工人阶级和劳动人民是实现大跃进的决定因素。经过伟大的全民整风运动，全厂职工的思想觉悟得到了大大的提高。去年第三季度上级党委指示我们厂要生产冶金设备、水泥设备以及较大型的机床时，对我们这个设备差、技术薄弱的厂来说，是有很大困难的。许多工人没有见过这些设备是什么样子，当时有些人说我们是“空想”。在党的领导下，各个车间召开了职工代表会，小组会，运用大鸣大放大字报的方法，深入开展了“能不能完成任务”，“怎样完成任务”等问题的讨论，进一步提高了群众的认识，大家提出保证，全厂三千四百多名职工坚决贯彻了自力更生和洋土结合的方针，按照党的指示，在“干劲加钻劲，人人献妙计，个个比智慧，大家闹革新”的口号下，掀起了以技术革新为中心内容的生产高潮，困难一个一个的被克服了，新纪录不断涌现。例如在制造冶金、水泥设备等新产品中，采用“蚂蚁啃骨头”的办法，解决了设备小，加工件大的难关，二百五十厘米轧钢机左右“牌坊”需要龙门刨加工，但我们的刨床小，部件进不去，金工车间工人曲和贵、陈国良同志，在刨床侧面竖一个车床面子，装上刀架，作为车臂龙门刨床使用，这样就顺利的进行了加工。铸造车间，铸转炉风带，单重四吨多，但厂内转炉的容量只有一吨，不能一次吹成，我们将原件分成四块浇注，然后焊接，解决了钢水不足的困难。金工车间加工转炉风带的圆孔，由于风带大、体量重、受了车间生产面积和起重设备的限制，不能在车间的摇臂钻床上加工，大刨床班的工人创造了小型“活动钻床”在风带上钻孔。在战胜一切困难的生产斗争中，增强了广大职工的斗志，大胆革新的工人，纷纷涌现，铆焊车间青工高文清，生产淘汰机零件，大胆改进模具，将原来手工操作，变成机械化，提高工效一千零七十二倍，成为全省技术革新标兵。全厂职工和全省职工一样，立即掀起了学高文清、赶高文清、超高文清的运动，随着出现蓝铁夫、白美娟等四个青年，创造二氧化碳造型法，提高工效二千八百倍。工具车间任文学，他在党支部领导和老师傅、技术员的帮助下，苦战七昼夜，经过三十多次试验，创造了高速钢退火法，提高工效十七万多倍，打破了书本上说的不能快速退火的迷信。我去年也和共同劳动的伙伴们，创造了氧气自动切割机，焊接圆筒自动转胎，解决了当时外国买不到而影响生产任务完成的困难，节约了原料。当我们厂推行“两参、一改、三结合”的工业宪法后，广大职工群众的积极性创造性更加提高了，主人翁的责任感更加增强了，去年，我们修改不利于生产和管理的各种陈旧规章制度一百零一种，大大推动了生产跃进和技术革命的深入发展，形成了领导和群众、干部和工人之间更加密切的新型关系，大家心心相印，齐心协力。
    沿着去年胜利的道路  创造今年更好的成绩
    一九五九年是我国苦战三年具有决定意义的一年，也是更大跃进的一年。我们贵阳矿山机器厂的全体职工在欢呼一九五八年伟大成就的时候，深深地认识到，自己完成的任务还有不够的地方，工作中还有不少缺点，与党的要求和社会主义建设的需要还相差很远，我决心根据周总理在政府工作报告中所指示的精神，与我们全厂职工一道，在党的领导下，沿着一九五八年胜利道路前进，为今年更大更好更全面的跃进，做出新的成绩。我们厂根据党的八届七中全会精神，制订了今年全年计划总产值比一九五八年增长一倍以上，主要产品产量今年计划比一九五八年增长一点七倍，为了确保完成这一伟大而艰巨的任务，入春以来，全厂职工鼓足了更大干劲，开展了一个轰轰烈烈的，以技术革命为中心内容的生产高潮。在全厂广大职工的积极努力下，第一季度计划已经胜利地超额完成。当前，不论新工人，老工人都在大鼓干劲，劲上加劲，巧上加巧，正以更短的时间，更少的人力，创造出更大的价值，制造更多的矿山、冶金、水泥设备，支援祖国各地和我们贵州省大规模的工业建设，迅速改变贵州省工业落后的面貌。我们一定要更高地举起共产主义思想的红旗，拿出更大的干劲，继续破除迷信，解放思想，大搞技术革命，学习先进经验，完成和超额完成今年的国家计划，做出卓越成绩，向国庆十周年献礼，为我们伟大的祖国立功。
