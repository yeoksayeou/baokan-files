Xinhua News Agency, Belgrade, May 22nd. According to today's "Borba" report, Yugoslav President Tito, when meeting with representatives of the Yugoslav People's Youth League and university professors on the 21st, said that after the student demonstration in Zagreb on May 11th due to dissatisfaction with the food, there were also student demonstrations in Macedonia. Tito believes: "This is an organized affair. No one can say that this was not organized by the enemy, because I know that the demonstrations in Zagreb and Macedonia are very closely linked." He definitely believes that "this is premeditated." Tito said: "Today I am here to publicly talk for the first time about certain events that initially occurred in Zagreb, and then in Macedonia." He said: "What surprises and saddens me the most is that some of our honest and kind young people also echoed the enemy and marched and demonstrated with them."

    南斯拉夫又有学生示威
    铁托承认“这是有组织的事情”
    新华社贝尔格莱德22日电　据今日“战斗报”报道，南斯拉夫总统铁托21日在接见南斯拉夫人民青年联盟代表团和大学教授等代表团时说，在5月11日萨格勒布的大学生因对伙食不满举行游行示威之后，接着在马其顿也有学生举行了游行示威。铁托认为：“这是有组织的事情。谁也不能说这不是敌人组织的，因为我知道，萨格勒布和马其顿的游行示威是非常密切联系着的”。他肯定认为，“这是预谋的。”铁托说：“今天我在这里第一次公开地谈谈最初在萨格勒布，然后在马其顿发生的某些事件。”他说：“最使我惊奇和伤心的是，我们某些正直和善良的青年也附和着敌人，和他们一起游行示威”。
