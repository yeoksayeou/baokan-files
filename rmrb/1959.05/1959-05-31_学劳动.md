Learning Labor
Don't dislike me because I'm small, don't look down on me because I'm short,
Washing my handkerchief, I do it myself,
No matter how dirty it is, I want it white!
I scrub the handkerchief,
You carry the water,
We two work together and play together,
The teacher praises us when she sees us,
Mom loves us in her heart when she sees us.

    学劳动
    飞花别嫌我小，别看我矮，洗手帕，自己来，管它多脏，我要它白！我把手帕搓，你把水来抬，咱两一起劳动一起玩，老师见了夸，妈妈见了心里爱。
