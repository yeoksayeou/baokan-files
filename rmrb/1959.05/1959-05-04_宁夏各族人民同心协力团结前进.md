Comrades Chairman, and fellow Delegates:

	We fully agree with Premier Zhou's Report on the Work of the Government, Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the Draft National Economic Plan for 1959, Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1958 State Final Accounts and the 1959 Draft State Budget, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen's Report on the Work of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China, and we are willing to resolutely implement the various policies, guidelines and tasks proposed in the reports with practical actions.

	Now, we would like to make a few simple remarks about the close unity and socialist construction of the people of all ethnic groups in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region:

	After smashing the conspiracy of Ma Zhenwu, a feudal reactionary chieftain disguised in the cloak of Islam, the Hui masses consciously stood up and added new vitality to socialist construction.

	The Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region was officially established in 1958 under the kind care of the great Communist Party of China, Chairman Mao, and the Central People's Government. The establishment of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region is another brilliant victory for the Party and the government's policy of equality among nationalities. Its establishment has also greatly encouraged the people of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, further strengthened their close unity, and thus further promoted their revolutionary enthusiasm for building socialism.

	On the basis of closer unity, the people of all ethnic groups in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region have undergone rectification and anti-rightist struggles, criticized localism and local nationalism, and achieved great victories on the political and ideological front, showing a new atmosphere. In particular, the Hui masses have consciously stood up, thoroughly smashed the conspiracy of Ma Zhenwu, a feudal reactionary chieftain disguised in the cloak of Islam, overthrown his gang of accomplices, eliminated his set of privileges that exploited and oppressed the masses, criticized the bad people and bad deeds within the religion, and marched boldly towards the socialist road from the shackles of feudal oppression and exploitation. In particular, the liberation of the vast number of Hui women from the kitchen has further strengthened the labor force, thus adding tremendous new strength to the cause of socialist construction. During the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the people of all ethnic groups in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, undaunted by difficulties and hardships, were in high spirits even in the freezing cold. Tens of thousands of people were in the mountains and in the fields, making great efforts in iron and steel smelting and water conservancy construction. In just over three months, they smelted 10,000 tons of steel and 30,000 tons of iron, so that Ningxia, which had never produced iron and steel, could also produce iron and steel; more than a dozen reservoirs have been built and are being built, with a storage capacity of millions, tens of millions, or even hundreds of millions of cubic meters each, which will play a great role in changing the drought in the mountainous areas. For us in Ningxia, these are things that we could not have imagined before. On other industrial and agricultural fronts, the people of all ethnic groups in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region have also created brilliant achievements. The total industrial output value in 1958 increased by 136 percent compared with 1957, and the power generation in 1958 was 10.64 million kilowatt-hours, an increase of 107 percent compared with 1957. The total grain output was 2.1 billion jin, an increase of 76 percent compared with 1957. The number of employees has increased from more than 5,000 in 1957 to more than 43,000, an increase of nearly nine times compared with 1957. In terms of population, it has increased from more than 1.7 million to more than 2 million. In terms of education, our region has also made unremitting efforts. The enrollment rate of school-age children has increased from 43.9 percent in 1957 to 90.4 percent, and the number of middle school students has increased from more than 13,000 in 1957 to more than 36,000, an increase of more than 170 percent compared with 1957. The establishment of three higher education institutions of agriculture, medicine and teacher training has opened a new era for education in our region. In the development of communes, the people of all ethnic groups in our region, due to the improvement of their awareness, have been fully communized in less than two months. The population joining the communes has reached 99.9 percent of the total population. All of these are the flourishing new atmosphere shown by the close unity, hard work and striving for progress of the people of all ethnic groups after the establishment of our Hui Autonomous Region. This new atmosphere has further inspired the people of all ethnic groups in Ningxia to take the bright road of socialism, and will greatly encourage the people of Ningxia to advance, advance and advance again!

	Why are the people of all ethnic groups in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region able to unite so closely, and why are they able to make such brilliant achievements with such high morale? This is entirely due to the wise leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, the kind care of the Central People's Government, and the strong support of the fraternal provinces, cities, and autonomous regions. Without these, it would be unimaginable. The people of all ethnic groups in Ningxia are very grateful to the Communist Party of China, Chairman Mao, the Central People's Government, and the fraternal provinces, cities, and autonomous regions. We will continue to strengthen our close unity and follow the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao forever!

	Tibet is an integral part of our great motherland's sacred territory, and no one can separate it from the motherland.

	Under the wise leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, the people of all ethnic groups in our great motherland are uniting closely like brothers and sisters, and are building a happy new socialist country with the momentum of ten thousand horses galloping forward. This is such a joyful and pleasant thing. Unexpectedly, the former Tibetan local government and a small handful of reactionary groups, at the expense of endangering the unity of the motherland and undermining the unity of nationalities, colluded with imperialism and launched an armed rebellion on March 10. We believe that this absurd act of the former Tibetan local government and the upper-level reactionary group is a complete violation of the Constitution and a betrayal of the motherland, and all Chinese people are indignant and severely condemn it! The State Council has ordered the dissolution of the former Tibetan local government and tasked the People's Liberation Army stationed in Tibet to quickly quell this rebellion. Such wise measures by our Central People's Government are very timely and correct, and we fully support them! Now that the rebellion has been basically quelled, some politicians in India have recently been taking advantage of the Tibetan rebellion to stir up trouble, and their diplomatic officials have distributed the so-called "Statement of the Dalai Lama." Why is this? It should be known that Tibet is an inseparable part of our great motherland's sacred territory, and no one can separate it from the motherland. Quelling the rebellion is also our internal affair, and no other country has any reason to interfere arbitrarily. India and our country are both great countries with friendly relations, and we should also cherish these friendly relations, but we must never allow expansionists to interfere in our internal affairs. We must maintain the friendship between our country and India, and we must not let reactionary expansionists succeed.

	If there is anything inappropriate in the above speech, please correct it at the conference.

    宁夏各族人民同心协力团结前进
    马腾霭　雷启霖代表的发言主席、各位代表：
    我们完全同意周总理的政府工作报告、李富春副总理关于一九五九年国民经济计划草案的报告、李先念副总理关于一九五八年国家决算和一九五九年国家预算草案的报告、彭真副委员长的中华人民共和国全国人民代表大会常务委员会的工作报告，并愿以实际行动坚决贯彻执行报告中所提出的各项方针政策和任务。
    现在，我们仅就宁夏回族自治区各族人民亲密团结和建设社会主义情况作如下一些简单发言：
    回民群众粉碎了披着伊斯兰教外衣的封建反动头子马震武的阴谋以后，自觉地站了起来，给社会主义建设增添了新生力量
    宁夏回族自治区在伟大的中国共产党、毛主席和中央人民政府的亲切关怀下，已经于一九五八年正式成立了。宁夏回族自治区的成立，是党和政府的民族平等政策的又一次光辉胜利。她的成立，也大大鼓舞了宁夏回族自治区的人民，进一步加强了他们的亲密团结，从而更促进了他们建设社会主义的革命干劲。
    宁夏回族自治区各族人民在更加亲密团结的基础上，经过了全民整风和反右派斗争，批判了地方主义和地方民族主义，在政治思想战线上取得了伟大的胜利，并更显出新的气象。特别是回民群众都自觉地站起来了，彻底粉碎了披着伊斯兰教外衣的封建反动头子马震武的阴谋，打倒了他的一群狐群狗党，肃清了他的一套剥削和压迫群众的特权，批判了宗教内部的坏人坏事，从封建压迫剥削的束缚下，迈开阔步向着社会主义的大道前进。尤其是广大回民妇女的摆脱锅台，更壮大了劳动力的队伍，因而在社会主义建设事业上，更添加了巨大的新生力量。一九五八年大跃进的时候，宁夏回族自治区各族人民不畏艰难困苦，甚至在冰天雪地的情况下，也精神百倍。成千成万在山上、在原野上，大炼钢铁，大修水利。在短短三个多月的时间内，他们竟炼了钢一万吨，铁三万吨，使向来不生产钢铁的宁夏也能生产钢铁啦；修建了和修建着十多个水库，每个水库的蓄水量从几百万方、几千万方到一亿多方，这将对改变山区干旱面貌起极大的作用。这些，在我们宁夏人来说，是想也想不到的事情。在其他工业和农业战线上，宁夏回族自治区各族人民也创造出辉煌的成就。一九五八年工业总产值比一九五七年增长了百分之一百三十六，一九五八年发电量为一千零六十四万度，比一九五七年增加百分之一百零七，粮食总产量是二十一亿斤，比一九五七年增加了百分之七十六。职工从一九五七年的五千多人已增加到四万三千多人，比一九五七年增加了将近九倍，在人口方面，从一百七十多万增加到二百多万。在教育方面，我区也作出了不懈的努力，学龄儿童入学率由一九五七年的百分之四十三点九增加到百分之九十点四，中学生由一九五七年的一万三千多人增加到三万六千多人，比一九五七年增百分之一百七十多，而农业、医学和师范三所高等学院的创办更为我区教育开了新纪元。在发展公社的时候，我区各族人民也由于觉悟的提高，在不到二个月的时间内就完全公社化了。入公社的人口达到总人口的百分之九十九点九。凡此种种，都是我们回族自治区成立以后，各族人民亲密团结，苦干实干，力争上游所表现的欣欣向荣的新气象。这个新气象更为宁夏各族人民启示了走社会主义的光明大道，将更大大鼓舞着我们宁夏人民前进、前进再前进！
    宁夏回族自治区各族人民为什么能够这么亲密团结，为什么能够这样鼓足干劲作出了辉煌的成绩呢？这完全是由于中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导，中央人民政府的亲切关怀以及各兄弟省、市、区的大力支援所致的。没有这些，那是不可想像的事情。我们宁夏各族人民非常感谢中国共产党、毛主席、中央人民政府和各兄弟省、市、区。并将继续加强亲密团结，永远跟着中国共产党和毛主席走！
    西藏是我们伟大祖国神圣领土的一部分，任何人也不能使她脱离祖国
    我们伟大的祖国的各族人民，在中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导下，正亲密团结如兄如弟，以万马奔腾之势建设着社会主义的幸福的新国家，这是多么使人高兴愉快的事。不料原西藏地方政府和一小撮反动集团，不惜危害祖国统一和破坏民族团结，勾结帝国主义于三月十日发动了武装叛乱。我们认为原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团，这种荒谬举动完全是违犯宪法和背叛祖国的罪行，凡属中国人民，莫不愤慨和严厉声讨！国务院已经命令解散原西藏地方政府，并责成驻藏人民解放军迅速平息这个叛乱。我中央人民政府这样的英明措施是非常适时而正确的，我们完全拥护！现在这个叛乱已基本平息了，但是最近印度的某些政治家又借着西藏叛乱事件兴风作浪，而其外交官员又散发了所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”，这是为什么呢？要知道，西藏是我们伟大祖国神圣领土不可分割的一部分，任何人也不能使她脱离祖国。平息叛乱也是我们的内政问题，任何其它国家都没有理由来妄加干涉。印度某些政治家这样作法是无异干涉我国内政，我们绝对不能容许。印度和我国都是大国，有着友好关系，我们也应当珍重这些友好关系，但是我们绝不能听任扩张主义分子来干涉我国内政，我们必须维护我国和印度的友谊，一定不让反动的扩张主义分子得逞。
    以上发言，如有不妥，请大会指正。
