Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, May 27th. The Japanese "Matsukawa Incident" Countermeasures Council and four other groups including the General Council of Trade Unions of Japan (Sohyo) issued a statement on the 26th, protesting the remarks of the Chief Justice of the Japanese Supreme Court.

The Chief Justice of the Japanese Supreme Court, Kotaro Tanaka, said at the National Conference of Presiding Judges on the 25th: "Recently, some criticisms of trials have exceeded the scope of freedom of speech and cannot be condoned."

The four groups said in a statement that Tanaka's remarks are a challenge to democracy and freedom.

The statement said that on the issue of the "Matsukawa Incident," the demand for the acquittal of all innocent defendants is because there are major discrepancies between the facts and the trial. The Supreme Court is currently hearing the "Matsukawa Incident" and is expected to deliver a judgment soon, but Tanaka Kotaro, as the presiding judge, has made such remarks, which indicates prejudgment and bias towards the verdict. It cannot be denied that Tanaka has abandoned his due impartial stance.

The four groups also stated that they would soon lodge a protest with the Supreme Court regarding this matter.

    日本“松川事件”对策协议会等团体声明
    抗议最高裁判所长官放弃公正立场
    新华社27日讯　东京消息：日本“松川事件”对策协议会和日本工会总评议会等四个团体26日发表声明，抗议日本最高裁判所长官的谈话。
    日本最高裁判所长官田中耕太郎25日在全国裁判所长官会议上说：“最近有一部分对审判的批评超过了言论自由的范围，是不能姑息的”。
    四个团体在声明中说：田中的谈话是对民主和自由的挑战。
    声明说，在“松川事件”问题上，要求无罪释放全体无辜被告是因为事实和审判有很大的分歧。最高裁判所目前正在审理“松川事件”，预料不久即将判决，但是身为审判长的田中耕太郎却发表了这样的言论，这是对判决有预断和偏见。这不能不认为田中已经放弃了应有的公正立场。
    四个团体并且表示，最近要就此事向最高裁判所提出抗议。
