The CCP Jiangsu Provincial Committee Notice:
    Summarize Experience in Large-Scale High Yields of Summer Harvest Crops

Nanjing, May 21 (Reported by this newspaper) The Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China notified Party committees at all levels to mobilize the masses to summarize the experience of large-scale high yields of summer crops.

The Provincial Committee notice stated that summer crops across the province have begun to be harvested, and many large areas of high-yield fields have emerged. In some areas with relatively poor conditions, the overall increase in summer crop production is smaller than in other areas with better conditions, but it is still large compared to the previous increase in production in those local areas; in particular, the increase in large-scale high-yield fields in these areas is even greater. Now, naked barley and barley have begun to be harvested, and the summer harvest campaign is about to fully unfold. On the eve of the comprehensive summer harvest, the Provincial Committee suggests that all localities seize the opportunity, take the county as a unit, select typical large-scale high-yield examples, hold on-site meetings by region, truthfully summarize the experience of large-scale high yields, and vigorously publicize the achievements and experiences of large-scale high yields.

Summarizing the experience of large-scale high yields of summer crops is of great significance for further implementing the Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture. This year, the production of summer crops in various regions has been very rich in experience in implementing the Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture; significant progress has been made in a series of tasks such as deep plowing and deep turning, rational close planting, fertilizer production and application, and field management compared to previous years. Of course, some places also have some shortcomings and problems due to lack of experience; however, as long as on-site visits and evaluations are organized in a timely and serious manner, and the experience of large-scale high yields of summer crops is comprehensively summarized, both successful experiences are promoted and lessons are learned from the shortcomings and problems in production, the Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture can be comprehensively and rationally implemented in the future, which can guarantee a greater harvest of autumn crops.

The on-site visit and evaluation and summary work for summer crops should focus on wheat. In areas with more rapeseed, broad beans, peas, and green manure crops, typical examples of large-scale high yields should also be selected and summarized. The scale of the on-site visit and evaluation and summary work should not be too large, the scope should not be too broad, and the number of people should not be too large. Generally speaking, it is best to divide a county into several different types of areas, select typical large-scale high-yield examples, and convene representatives of commune and team cadres and elderly, middle-aged, and young male and female farmers nearby to visit, discuss, and summarize, both vigorously and practically. This work should be directly presided over by the county party committee, and the agricultural departments should organize scientific and technical personnel to carry out specific work. In short, attention should be paid to practical results and formalism should be prevented.

While summarizing the experience of high yields of summer crops, all localities should carefully rank all crops, as well as all industries of forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery, discover advanced typical examples, and help them summarize their experience, so that large-scale high-yield red flags can be established in all aspects and promote the comprehensive upsurge of agricultural, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery production.

### 中共江苏省委通知  总结夏收作物大面积高产经验

    中共江苏省委通知
    总结夏收作物大面积高产经验
    本报南京21日电　中国共产党江苏省委通知各级党委，发动群众总结夏熟作物大面积高产经验。
    省委通知说，全省各地夏熟作物开始收获，并且出现了许多大面积的高额丰产片。有些条件比较差的地方，夏熟作物总的增产幅度比起其他条件较好的地方虽然小一点，但是和当地以往的增产幅度比较起来还是大的；特别是这些地区的大面积高产片的增产幅度还要更大一些。现在，元麦、大麦已经开镰收割，夏收运动就要全面展开。在全面进行夏收的前夕，省委建议各地抓紧时机，以县为单位，选择大面积高产典型，分片召开现场会议，实事求是地总结大面积高产经验，大张旗鼓地宣传大面积高产的成就和经验。
    总结夏熟作物大面积高产的经验，对进一步贯彻执行农业八字宪法，具有十分重大的意义。今年各地夏熟作物的生产，在执行八字宪法方面，都有十分丰富的经验；深耕深翻、合理密植、造肥施肥、田间管理等一系列的工作，都比往年有显著的进步。当然，有些地方由于缺乏经验，也有某些缺点和问题；但是，只要适时地认真地组织参观评比，把夏熟作物大面积的高产经验全面地总结起来。既发扬成功的经验，又从生产上的缺点和问题中吸取教训，今后就能全面地合理地贯彻执行八字宪法，就可以保证秋作物的更大丰收。
    夏熟作物的参观评比总结工作，要以麦子为重点，油菜、蚕豆、豌豆、绿肥等作物比较多的地区，也应选择大面积高产典型，加以总结。参观评比总结的规模不宜过大，范围不宜过广，人数也不宜过多。一般说来，一个县里最好分成几个不同类型的片，选择其中的大面积高产典型，就近召集社队干部和老年、中年、青年男女农民的代表，一边参观，一边议论，一边总结，既轰轰烈烈，又踏踏实实。这项工作，由县委直接主持，农业部门组织科学技术人员进行具体工作。总之，要注意实际效果，防止形式主义。
    在总结夏熟作物高产经验的同时，各地应当把各项农作物，把林、牧、副、渔各行业，仔细排一下队，发现先进典型，帮助他们总结经验，以便在各个方面都能树起大面积高产红旗，促进农、林、牧、副、渔生产的全面高涨。
