Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, May 14th: The basic construction projects of Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation this year have entered a peak construction period. Currently, the workers are doing everything possible to accelerate the construction of ore dressing, sintering, coking, ironmaking, steelmaking, and refractory material systems, while ensuring quality. The blooming mill of the rolling system will also be officially built soon.

Currently, the strength of seven construction companies and specialized companies is being concentrated on the construction site to accelerate the construction of the projects. In the No. 2 blast furnace system, the furnace shell, hot blast stove, washing tower, and other components have been installed. Now, the furnace top is being installed, the furnace bricks are being laid, the inclined bridge is being erected, the pipelines are being laid, the iron tapping bay is being built, and the dust collector is being hoisted. The foundation of the main plant building of the sintering plant is still being backfilled, while a 38-meter-high reinforced concrete platform is being built on top, and equipment such as sintering machines, exhaust fans, flue gas fans, gas collection pipes, cooling discs, and electrical control panels are being installed and calibrated. The ore dressing plant, built at the foot of the Daye Iron Mine, has basically completed the civil engineering work of the main plant building and the concentrating pool, and is now installing ball mills, flotation machines, magnetic separators, and hydrocyclones. The workers building the No. 3 coke oven are adopting the method of baking the furnace while installing the furnace door frame, coal feeding truck, and other equipment to speed up the construction.

More than ten projects of the No. 1 open hearth furnace system have also been fully started. Now, the foundation of the factory building pillars and the foundation of the No. 1 open hearth furnace have been built. The furnace body is being assembled and will be installed immediately.

According to requirements, the No. 2 blast furnace and the sintering plant must be completed in more than three months, and the quality must be guaranteed. In order to complete this arduous task, the construction workers reformed the construction procedures. In the construction of the No. 2 blast furnace, the workers of the civil engineering company chose the hot blast stove, hoisting machine room, iron tapping bay and other projects with relatively large installation workload to be constructed first. As soon as the civil engineering of these projects is completed, the installation company can immediately enter the site to install the equipment. In the construction of the sintering plant, the Wuhan Iron and Steel Ironmaking Headquarters proposed the construction method of "building and installation simultaneously," without waiting for the factory building to be built and the walls to be built. As long as the platform is built, the installation workers will enter the site to install the equipment. In this way, the construction period can be shortened by more than half.

The construction workers also carried out technical innovations to improve labor productivity. In the past, it took at least twelve hours to install one ring of the furnace shell of the No. 1 blast furnace. When installing the furnace shell of the No. 2 furnace, the welders and hoisting workers tried to improve the operation method. Each ring can be installed in only a few tens of minutes, and the installation quality also exceeds the national standards. When building the 100-meter-high chimney of the open hearth furnace, the workers contributed 250 suggestions and implemented cross-parallel operations, working simultaneously from top to bottom and inside to outside, and completed the construction in only fourteen days.
    
Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, May 14th: Wuhan City has taken various measures to vigorously support the construction of Wuhan Iron and Steel, to ensure the national key projects.

Since the beginning of spring this year, Wuhan City has established a command headquarters to support Wuhan Iron and Steel, directly leading the work of supporting Wuhan Iron and Steel. More than 20 machinery factories in the city, under the circumstances of very heavy original tasks, still squeezed out the strength to complete some production tasks proposed by Wuhan Iron and Steel as soon as possible, ensuring certain needs of Wuhan Iron and Steel.

Wuhan Iron and Steel needs 330,000 cubic meters of stone and 163,000 cubic meters of sand in the second quarter, which is a large amount and difficult to transport. Wuhan City specially sent people to the production areas in nearby Yingcheng, Jiayu and other counties to assist the rural areas in organizing transportation forces.

### 质量与速度兼顾　建筑与安装并进  武钢基本建设跨上施工高峰

    质量与速度兼顾　建筑与安装并进
    武钢基本建设跨上施工高峰
    新华社武汉14日电　武汉钢铁公司今年的基本建设工程已经进入施工高峰。目前，职工们正在保证质量的原则下，想尽一切方法加速建设选矿、烧结、炼焦、炼铁、炼钢和耐火材料等系统的工程；轧钢系统的初轧厂也将马上正式兴建。
    现在，工地上正集中七个工程公司和专业公司的力量加紧工程建设。二号高炉系统已经安装好高炉、热风炉、洗涤塔等炉壳，现在正在安装炉顶，砌炉砖，架斜桥，铺管道，盖出铁场和吊装除尘器。烧结厂的主厂房基础还在回填土，而上面已在修筑三十八公尺高的钢筋混凝土平台，安装和校正烧结机、抽风机、排烟机、集气管、冷却盘与电气操作盘等设备。建设在大冶铁山山脚下的选矿厂，已经基本完成了主厂房和浓缩池的土建工程，正在安装球磨机、浮选机、磁选机和水力旋转器等设备。建设三号焦炉的工人，采取一边烘炉、一边安装炉门框、给煤车等设备的办法，加快建设速度。
    一号平炉系统的十多项工程也已全面动工，现在已筑好厂房柱子基础和一号平炉基础，正在拼装炉体，马上就要安装。
    按照要求，二号高炉和烧结厂要在三个多月里建成，而且要保证质量好。为了完成这个艰巨的任务，建设工人们改革了施工程序。在二号高炉施工中，土建公司的职工们选择了安装工程量比较大的热风炉、卷扬机室、出铁场等项目先施工，等这些项目的土建工程一完，安装公司就可以立即进场安装设备。在烧结厂的施工中，武钢炼铁指挥部提出“建筑和安装同时并进”的施工方法，不等盖起厂房，砌好墙壁，只要筑好平台，安装工人就进场安装设备。这样，建设工期可以缩短一半以上。
    建设工人们还大搞技术革新，提高劳动生产率。过去一号高炉每安装一圈炉壳最快要十二小时，安装二号炉的炉壳时，电焊工人、吊装工人都想办法改进操作方法，每安装一圈只要几十分钟，安装质量也超过了国家规定的标准。在砌筑平炉的一百公尺高的烟囱时，职工献计二百五十条，实行交叉平行作业，上下内外同时干，只用十四天就砌完了。
    据新华社武汉14日电　武汉市采取各种措施大力支援武钢建设，确保国家重点工程。
    今年开春以来，武汉市就成立了支援武钢指挥部，直接领导支援武钢的工作。全市二十多个机械工厂在原有任务十分繁重的情况下，仍然挤出力量尽先完成武钢提出的一些生产任务，保证了武钢一定的需要。
    武钢二季度需要三十三万立方公尺石料和十六万三千立方公尺的砂子，数量很大，运输困难。武汉市就专门派人到附近的应山、嘉鱼等县产地，协助农村组织运输力量。
