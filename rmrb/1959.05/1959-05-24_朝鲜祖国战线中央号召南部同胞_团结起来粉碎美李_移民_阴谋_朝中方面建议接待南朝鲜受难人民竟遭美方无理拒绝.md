Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 23rd -- The Central Committee of the Korean Fatherland Front today issued a letter to South Korean compatriots, calling on them to unite to fight against the US aggressors and the Li Seung-man clique's "emigration" plot to sell the South Korean people as slaves to foreign countries.

The letter to South Korean compatriots said that US imperialism and the Li Seung-man clique are frantically pushing forward their heinous "emigration" plot, and disaster is rapidly befalling our South Korean brothers. We must never allow this vicious plot to succeed. The letter to South Korean compatriots also pointed out that the root of all the misfortunes and sufferings of the South Korean people lies in the US imperialist occupation of South Korea and the reactionary rule of Li Seung-man. The Fatherland Front calls on the entire nation to unite and struggle to drive US imperialism out of South Korea.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 23rd -- The Korean Military Armistice Commission held a meeting today at the suggestion of the Korean-Chinese side. At the meeting, Major General Zhu Changjun, the chief member of the Korean-Chinese side, sternly condemned the US side and the Li Seung-man clique's plot to sell the South Korean people to foreign countries as slaves in the name of so-called "emigration," and put forward measures to promote the implementation of the proposals put forward by the government of the Republic in its statement issued on the 22nd on this matter. Major General Zhu Changjun suggested: 1. Both sides of the Military Armistice Commission should allow representatives from North and South Korea to enter Panmunjom or other locations in the demilitarized zone agreed upon by both sides to hold meetings on specific matters related to the handover of unemployed persons, displaced farmers, and homeless orphans residing in the US side's area, and to arrange meeting places for them. 2. Both sides should allow unemployed persons, displaced farmers, and homeless orphans in the US side's area to enter the Korean-Chinese side's area through the northern and southern edges of the demilitarized zone and the military demarcation line. 3. Both sides should allow all people from North and South Korea who travel to each other for non-military purposes such as visiting relatives and conducting trade to pass through the northern and southern edges of the demilitarized zone and the military demarcation line, provide them with convenience, and designate Panmunjom, Cheorwon, and other locations in the demilitarized zone agreed upon by both sides as crossing points.

At the meeting, the US side unreasonably rejected the suggestions of the Korean-Chinese side on the pretext that the above-mentioned issues were not within the scope of discussion of the Military Armistice Commission.

    新华社平壤23日电　朝鲜祖国战线中央委员会今天发表告南朝鲜同胞书，号召他们一致起来为粉碎美国侵略者和李承晚集团把南朝鲜人民当作奴隶卖给外国的“移民”阴谋而斗争。
    告南朝鲜同胞书说，美帝国主义和李承晚集团正在疯狂地推行他们的罪恶的“移民”阴谋，灾难正在迅速地临到南朝鲜兄弟们的头上，我们绝不能容许这一凶恶的阴谋得逞。告南朝鲜同胞书还指出，南朝鲜人民所遭受的一切不幸和痛苦的根源在于美帝国主义对南朝鲜的强占和李承晚的反动统治。祖国战线号召全民族团结起来，进行斗争，使美帝国主义滚出南朝鲜。
    新华社平壤23日电　朝鲜军事停战委员会今天在朝中方面建议下举行了会议。朝中方面首席委员朱昌骏少将在会上严厉谴责了美方和李承晚集团以所谓“移民”为名，企图把南朝鲜人民当做奴隶卖往外国的阴谋，并且提出关于促使实现共和国政府在22日就此发表的声明中提出的建议的措施。朱昌骏少将建议：一、军事停战委员会双方准许南北朝鲜代表进入板门店或非军事区内双方协议的其他地点，就有关交接居住在美方地区的失业者、离乡农民和流浪孤儿的具体事宜举行会议，并且为他们安排会议场所。二、双方准许美方地区内的失业者、离乡农民和流浪孤儿通过非军事区南北缘和军事分界线，进入朝中方面地区。三、双方准许南北朝鲜所有的为探亲、通商等非军事目的而互相来往的人通过非军事区南北缘和军事分界线，为他们提供便利，并且指定板门店、铁原和非军事区内双方协议的其他地区为通过地点。
    美方在会上以上述问题不属于军事停战委员会讨论的范围为借口，无理拒绝了朝中方面的建议。
