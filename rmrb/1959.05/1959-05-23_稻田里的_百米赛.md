    "Hundred-Meter Race" in the Rice Paddy
    By our reporter Ren Bufang
    Liaoning Province has recently entered the busy season of rice transplanting. Compared with the southern regions, the rice transplanting season here is later; but locally speaking, this year's transplanting period is more than 20 days earlier than in previous years.
    In the past, farmers in Liaoning mostly used direct seeding methods to grow rice, and the yield was not high. In recent years, the method of raising seedlings and transplanting has been gradually promoted throughout the province; this year, the area of ​​raising seedlings and transplanting accounts for 80% of all rice fields. In order to promote and impart advanced rice transplanting techniques, Liaoning Province recently held a grand rice transplanting competition in the Shuigen People's Commune in Yingkou County.
    One day in early May, a ship full of passengers appeared in the lower reaches of the Liao River, going upstream to the north. Suddenly, gongs and drums and applause rang out in the green trees on the east bank, followed by laughter... It turned out that the members of the Shuigen People's Commune in Yingkou County were welcoming rice transplanting experts from all over the province. The Liaoning Provincial Rice Transplanting Competition was about to be held in the rice fields of this commune, which made all the members feel novel and excited. Farmers compete in planting land, which is also a rare learning opportunity!
    First Encounter
    The rice fields in each competition area are as smooth as mirrors, and the 1.2-meter-wide, 100-meter "racetracks" are inlaid with rice seedlings. Bundles of rice seedlings are evenly arranged in the "racetracks." The reflections of colorful flags around the rice fields and the lush green rice seedlings form a beautiful water landscape.
    Not far away, 153 male and female contestants with numbers on their backs are doing pre-competition preparation activities on the training ground.
    The competition is about to begin. The contestants each hold a bundle of seedlings, stand at the starting point of their respective lanes facing away from the finish line, and bend over in a transplanting posture. The referees stand solemnly beside them, just like in a short-distance running competition on a sports field. However, it is different from ordinary short-distance running competitions: First, the contestants have to move backwards; second, it is not only about speed, but also about transplanting according to the specifications stipulated by the conference, and achieving a certain quality standard. The conference stipulates that each person must transplant six rows of seedlings in the lane, with a row spacing of six inches, a hole spacing of two inches, eight to twelve seedlings per hole, a depth of no more than one inch, an error of no more than 20% in the number of holes, a seedling drift rate of no more than 2%, a missing hole rate of no more than 3%, and a lateral deviation of no more than one inch in each row.
    The referee watched the stopwatch in his left hand, waved the colored flag in his right hand, and issued the order to start the competition. At this time, the entire field was silent, and the rhythmic sound of watering could be heard clearly. The contestants all raced against time, with their hands close to the water surface, dividing the seedlings with their left hands and quickly transplanting the seedlings with their right hands. They kept moving backwards, and six neat rows of rice seedlings quickly stretched forward. Less than five minutes into the competition, Gao Guitian, contestant number 33 from the Shuigen People's Commune in the first competition area, stood out from the ranks and went to the front. He reached the finish line first at a speed of more than 130 holes per minute. After inspection by the referee, the quality of the transplanting fully met the specifications, making him the best player in the men's preliminary round.
    At the same time, the women's preliminary round in the second competition area attracted more attention from the audience. A contestant running in the front with very agile movements was constantly praised by the audience. Some viewers even applauded enthusiastically to encourage her. She was Park Yu-lan, a 22-year-old contestant from the Xihai State Farm in Gaiping County. As a result of the preliminary round, Park Yu-lan, who was the first to reach the finish line, won second place with a score of 6,375 holes transplanted per hour. Why wasn't the first to reach the finish line the first place? It turned out that Sun Xiuying, from the Shuigen Commune, who competed in the same field as Park Yu-lan, although she was not the first to reach the finish line, the female commune member, who had several years of transplanting experience, did not ignore density and quality in order to simply strive to reach the finish line first. After inspection by the referee, Sun Xiuying transplanted as many as 7,263 holes per hour according to the unified calculation of time, specifications, and quality standards, which made her firmly in the first place in the women's group.
    The Final Begins
    The final begins. The audience from the three competition areas during the preliminary round surrounded the final venue. The referees led the 31 male and female contestants who had qualified for the final into the venue, and the audience applauded warmly to wish them excellent results. These experts did not disappoint everyone's expectations. They observed each other's transplanting skills in the preliminary round and corrected their shortcomings. They were determined to apply the newly learned experiences to practice.
    "Faster than picking bean grains!"
    "Really like chickens pecking rice!"
    This is the most common description of the scene of transplanting by the audience. The audience focused on the experts' movements of holding seedlings, dividing seedlings, transplanting seedlings, and moving their feet backwards. Some nodded frequently and praised silently; some applauded from time to time to express their admiration; and some quickly wrote down the experiences they saw in their notebooks, and then immediately raised their heads, fearing that they would miss any details that could be learned.
    Worthy of being the winners of the preliminary round. Today's advancing formation is no longer the situation in the preliminary round where the front and rear distances were too far, but almost shoulder to shoulder. It was not until after 30 meters that the distance widened. Gao Guitian and Sun Xiuying from the Shuigen Commune still maintained the advantages of the preliminary round and continued to lead in the final, winning the men's and women's transplanting championships.
    Traveling Thousands of Miles to Seek Teachers, Learning from Each Other
    Opportunity knocks but once. This motto has become the action guide to encourage the contestants participating in this competition to learn from each other. It not only brings together rice transplanting experts from all over Liaoning Province, but also four male and female rice transplanting experts from Zhejiang and Hubei provinces. The guests from afar are the main speakers at the small-scale experience exchange meeting. Guo Hongying, a 16-year-old female contestant from Yicheng County, Hubei Province, was even more warmly welcomed by the female contestants from Liaoning. After graduating from senior elementary school two years ago, she participated in agricultural production. She only learned to transplant rice last spring, transplanting more than 10,000 holes a day. After diligent study and hard work, she had improved to more than 70,000 holes a day by the fall of last year. Although she has achieved such results, she still said from time to time when exchanging experiences: We still need to learn from the older sisters. Xu Xiangyi and Zhang Ruican from Huangyan County, Zhejiang Province, not only introduced their experiences without reservation, but also gave actual demonstrations. Their transplanting speed and quality won people's admiration and praise.
    During the competition, a humble atmosphere of learning prevailed everywhere, whether on the competition field, on the streets, in the courtyards, in the dormitories, or in the cafeteria. Park Yu-lan, a female contestant from Gaiping County, had just walked out of the competition field and was sitting on the bank washing her feet. Several contestants walked over at the same time, gathered together, and asked her about the action of rolling the seedling rope with her fingers. Park Yu-lan's action of rolling off the bundled seedling rope with five fingers attracted the attention of many contestants. They believed that her rolling method could tighten the rice seedlings from all around, loosen the rope, and roll it off at once, which was much faster than rolling the rope with only the thumb and forefinger.
    The rest time before and after meals was regarded as the most precious moment by the contestants from all over the country. They were busy looking for objects to learn from, and after finding them, they sat on the ground and talked. Even during meals, how to transplant quickly was also the center of discussion. Some used chopsticks as rice seedlings, and their hands kept practicing the newly learned actions of holding seedlings, dividing seedlings, sending seedlings, and taking seedlings.
    Yang Yongxin, a female contestant from Liaozhong County, seemed particularly busy. She regarded every expert as her learning model, asking for advice from everyone she met, thinking about what she heard, and practicing what she understood in the rice fields. She learned from Wu Guinan, a female contestant from Shenyang City, the experience of coordinating the movements of both hands and transplanting quickly; she also learned from Sun Xiuying, the provincial champion, the experience of keeping her feet straight when retreating, retreating her left foot when transplanting to the right, retreating her right foot when transplanting to the left, and transplanting evenly.
    Where Do Good Results Come From?
    The male and female champions who won this competition are not only learning models for others, but they are also seriously absorbing the experiences of others by learning from each other's strengths and compensating for their weaknesses. In the preliminary rounds of the competition, the men's champion Wu Guitian carefully observed the various actions of the contestants from all over the country. He discovered his shortcomings that his hands were too high from the water surface, which was tiring to his waist, and that he took the seedlings too far from the roots, which resulted in deep planting. In the final, he corrected these shortcomings and transplanted one hundred and sixteen more holes per hour than in the preliminary round. After the preliminary round, the women's champion Sun Xiuying learned from Sun Suyun the action of transplanting the last two seedlings in each bundle of rice seedlings with both hands at the same time, and also learned from other contestants the experience of using the afterglow of her eyes to accurately see the position of the next bundle of rice seedlings when transplanting seedlings, which changed her past shortcomings of finding another bundle of seedlings after transplanting one bundle, which delayed time. Absorbing these experiences enabled her to increase her score per hour in the final from 7,263 holes to 8,616 holes. When people congratulated her, her reply to everyone's gift was: Continue to work hard, break through 9,000 holes per hour, and march towards 10,000 holes.
    The competition is over, and the contestants from all over the country have returned with full loads and embarked on the front line of transplanting. When they parted, they thanked each other and congratulated each other for bringing the experience they learned this time back to their local areas to promote it, so that it could become the fruitful result of this year's rice harvest.

    稻田里的“百米赛”
    本报记者　任步芳
    辽宁省最近进入了插秧的大忙时期。和南方地区相比，这里的插秧季节是较晚的；但在当地来说，今年的插秧期却比往年提早了二十多天。
    过去，辽宁农民多用直播的方法种植水稻，产量不高。近几年来，全省各地才逐步地推广了育秧移栽的方法；今年育秧移栽面积占全部稻田的80％。为了推广和传授先进的插秧技术，辽宁省最近在营口县水源人民公社举行了一个插秧比赛的盛会。
    5月初的一天，辽河下游出现了一艘载满乘客的轮船，逆流北上，突然东岸的一片翠绿的树丛中响起了锣鼓声和鼓掌声，接着又是一片欢笑声……。原来营口县水源人民公社社员在这里欢迎了来自全省各地的插秧能手们。辽宁省插秧能手比武大会将要在这个社的稻田里举行，这使全体社员既感到新奇又感到兴奋，庄稼人种地要比赛，这也正是个难得的学习机会呵！
    初次交锋
    各个赛区的稻田平整如镜，用稻秧镶成的一点二公尺宽的百公尺“跑道”，“跑道”中均匀地排列着一束束的稻秧。稻田四周各色彩旗的倒影，和葱绿的稻秧构成了一幅美丽的水上图画。
    不远处，一百五十三名身后贴着号码的男女选手们，正在练习场地上作比赛前的准备活动。
    比赛就要开始了。选手们各持一束秧苗，背向终点站在自己的跑道起点，弯着腰作出插秧的姿势。裁判员严肃地站在他们身旁，俨然像一场体育场上的短跑比赛。可是，它和一般的短跑比赛又不相同：第一，选手要倒退前进；第二，不仅比时间，选手们还要根据大会规定，按规格插秧，达到一定的质量标准。大会规定每人在跑道中要插六行秧，行距六寸，穴距二寸，每穴秧苗八至十二棵，深度不得超过一寸，误差穴数不超过20％，漂苗率不超过2％，丢穴不超3％，每行左右歪斜不得超过一寸。
    裁判员注视着左手的跑表，右手的彩旗一挥，下达了比赛开始的口令。这时，全场寂静无声，清晰地听到了有节奏的打水声。选手们个个分秒必争，两只手紧贴着水面，左手不停地分秧，右手迅速地插秧。他们不断地后退，六行整齐的稻秧快速地向前伸延。比赛还不到五分钟，第一赛区的三十三号选手——水源人民公社的高贵田，就突出行列，到最前面去了。他以每分钟插秧一百三十多穴的速度第一个到达终点，经过裁判员的检查，插的质量完全合乎规格，成为男子组预赛中成绩最好的选手。
    与此同时，第二赛区的女选手们的预赛，吸引了更多观众的注意。只见一名跑在最前面、动作非常敏捷的选手，受到观众的不断赞扬。有些观众还热烈鼓掌鼓励她。她是来自盖平县西海国营农场的二十二岁选手朴玉兰。预赛结果，第一个冲到终点的朴玉兰，以每小时插秧六千三百七十五穴的成绩，获得第二名。为什么第一个到达终点的不是第一名呢？原来与朴玉兰同场比赛的水源公社的孙秀英，虽然不是第一个到达终点，但是这个已有几年插秧经验的女社员，没有为了单纯争取先到终点而忽视密度和质量。经裁判员检查，按时间规格质量等标准统一计算，孙秀英每小时竟插了七千二百六十三穴，这使她在女子组中稳居首位。
    决赛开始了
    决赛开始了。预赛时三个赛区的观众，把决赛场地围得水泄不通。裁判员带领着三十一名取得决赛权的男女选手进入场地，观众们报以热烈掌声，预祝他们取得优秀成绩。这些能手们并没辜负大家的期望，他们在预赛中就相互观摩了各人的插秧技巧，纠正了自己的缺点。他们决心把新学到的经验运用到实际中去。
    “比拣豆粒还快！”
    “真像小鸡啄米！”
    这是观众称赞插秧情景最普遍的形容词。观众们聚精会神地注视着能手们的握秧、分秧、插秧和两脚后退的动作，有的频频点头，暗自称赞；有的不时鼓掌，表示佩服；还有的把看到的经验迅速地记在笔记本上，又立即台起头，恐怕错过了任何一点可以学习的细节。
    不愧是预赛的优胜者。今天的前进队形，不再是预赛时前后距离太远的局势了，几乎是齐肩并进。直到三十公尺以后，才拉大了距离。水源公社的高贵田、孙秀英，仍保持预赛时的优势，决赛中一直领先，取得了男女插秧冠军。
    千里寻师，互相学习
    机不可失，时不再来。这句名言成了鼓舞参加这次比武大会选手们互相学习的行动指南。这里不仅汇集了辽宁全省的插秧能手，还有来自浙江、湖北省的四名男女插秧能手。远道而来的客人，都是小型经验交流会的主要发言人。湖北省宜城县十六岁的女选手郭宏英，更受到辽宁女选手们的热烈欢迎。她在前年高小毕业后，参加了农业生产，去年春天刚刚学会插秧，每天只插一万多穴，经过勤学苦练和埋头钻研，去年秋季每天已提高到七万多穴。她虽已取得这样成绩，但在交流经验时，仍不时地说着：还要向大姐们学习。浙江省黄岩县的徐祥义、张瑞灿，不仅毫不保留地介绍了经验，并且作了实际表演，他俩的插秧速度和质量，博得人们的钦佩和赞扬。
    比武大会进行期间，不论在竞赛场上、街道上、庭院里、宿舍里、食堂里，到处都洋溢着虚心学习的气氛。盖平县女选手朴玉兰刚刚走出竞赛场地，正坐在岸上洗脚，不约而同地走来几名选手，聚在一起，向他请教了用手指撸秧绳的动作。朴玉兰用五个手指撸掉捆秧绳的动作，引起很多选手的重视，他们认为她的撸法可以从四周压紧稻秧，使秧绳松弛，一下子就可撸掉，比只用大姆指、食指撸绳快的多。
    饭前饭后的休息时间，被各地选手们视为最宝贵的时刻。他们忙着寻找学习的对象，找到后就席地而坐攀谈起来。甚至在吃饭时，如何插的快也是谈论的中心。有的把筷子作稻秧，两手不停地练习着新学到的握秧、分秧、送秧、取秧等动作。
    辽中县的女选手杨永馨，显得特别忙碌。她把每个能手都看作是自己的学习榜样，见人就请教，听到就思考，领会了就去稻田实际操作、练习。她学习了沈阳市女选手吴贵南两手动作协调、插的快的经验；也学习了全省冠军孙秀英两脚退步不歪、插到右边退左脚、插到左边退右脚、插得均匀的经验。
    好成绩哪里来
    获得这次比赛的男女冠军，不只是别人的学习榜样，他俩也在认真地取长补短地吸取别人的经验。男子冠军吴贵田，在预赛的各场比赛中，细心地观察了各地选手的各项动作。发现了自己两手离水皮太高、累腰和拿苗离根太远、栽的深的缺点。决赛中纠正了这些缺点，每小时比预赛多插了一百十六穴。女子冠军孙秀英，在预赛后向孙素云学习了每束稻秧剩到最后两穴秧苗用两手一齐插的动作，又学习了其他选手在插秧时用眼睛的余光看准下一束稻秧位置的经验，改变了她过去插完一束现找另一束、耽误时间的缺点。吸取了这些经验，使她在决赛中每小时的成绩由七千二百六十三穴一跃而为八千六百十六穴。人们向她祝贺时，她答谢大家的礼物是：继续苦练，突破每小时九千穴，向一万穴进军。
    比赛结束了，各地选手都满载而归，走上了插秧的第一线。他们在分手时，互相致谢，彼此祝贺把这次学到的经验带回本地去推广，使它变成今年水稻丰产的硕果。
