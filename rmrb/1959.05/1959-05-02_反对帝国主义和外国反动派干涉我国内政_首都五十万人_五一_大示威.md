The mighty parade, holding countless flags and banners, marched through Tiananmen Square. People angrily shouted: "Oppose the imperialists and foreign reactionaries' instigation of the Tibetan rebellion, oppose interference in China's internal affairs!"

The great leader of all ethnic groups in China, Chairman Mao Zedong, and Party and state leaders such as Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai, Zhu De, Soong Ching Ling, Dong Biwu, Chen Yun, Lin Biao, and Deng Xiaoping, reviewed the mass parade from Tiananmen Gate today. When Chairman Mao and other Party and state leaders appeared on the reviewing stand of Tiananmen Gate, the music of "The East is Red" was played, cheers erupted in the square, and people waved flags and bouquets, enthusiastically shouting "Long live Chairman Mao!"

After celebrating the great victories of the people of the whole country on the industrial, agricultural production fronts and other fronts, as well as the great victory of the people's commune movement in rural areas across the country, Peng Zhen emphasized: Tibet is an inalienable part of Chinese territory. Putting down the Tibetan rebellion is our country's internal affair, and absolutely no foreign interference is allowed! We must thoroughly eliminate the rebellion of the pro-imperialist elements in Tibet and shatter the conspiracy of imperialists and foreign interventionists to interfere in our internal affairs, support the rebels, and undermine our national unity! Peng Zhen said that we warmly celebrate the victory of suppressing the rebellion of the reactionary group in Tibet, and express our highest respect and cordial greetings to the Chinese People's Liberation Army units and the Tibetan people who assisted in suppressing the rebellion.

Peng Zhen also said that the US imperialists are still occupying our territory Taiwan. We must liberate Taiwan, Penghu, Jinmen and Mazu! The US's conspiracy to create two Chinas must be completely shattered. All US armed forces must withdraw from the Taiwan area!

Peng Zhen called on everyone to resolutely implement the resolutions of the First Session of the Second National People's Congress, continue to exert efforts, strive for progress, overcome all difficulties, continue to carry forward the spirit of hard work, practical work, and skillful work, and widely launch a mass movement to increase production and practice economy, and strive to fulfill and overfulfill the 1959 industrial and agricultural production plan!

After Peng Zhen's speech, the band played the music of "Ode to the Motherland," and the parade formed 110 columns and marched from the newly widened East Chang'an Street towards Tiananmen Square.

Tiananmen Square, after initial renovations this year, is even wider and more expansive. As in previous years, a huge portrait of Chairman Mao Zedong hangs in the center of Tiananmen Gate. Portraits of Marx, Engels, Lenin, Stalin, and Sun Yat-sen are erected on the east and west sides and the south end of the square. The national flag of the People's Republic of China fluttered in the sky above the square.

The viewing stands in the square were filled with more than 10,000 people. They were foreign guests who were invited to visit our country, diplomatic envoys from various countries to China, experts from various countries who helped our country's construction, and representatives from all ethnic groups and all walks of life in the country.

On the viewing stand, representatives of the People's Liberation Army who had just arrived from Tibet and made outstanding achievements in suppressing the rebellion were especially warmly welcomed by the parading masses. People constantly cheered them: "Celebrate the great victory of the People's Liberation Army in quickly suppressing the Tibetan rebellion and consolidating national defense!"

In today's demonstration parade, people from all ethnic groups and all walks of life expressed great indignation at the imperialists and foreign reactionaries' instigation of the Tibetan rebellion and interference in China's internal affairs.

Tibetan teachers and students from the Central Institute for Nationalities, staff members of the Dalai's office in Beijing and the Panchen's office in Beijing, Tibetan cadres working in Beijing, and many lamas in robes, unanimously condemned the crimes of the original Tibetan local government and upper-class reactionaries in colluding with foreign countries and splitting the motherland, condemned the actions of British imperialists and Indian expansionists in instigating the Tibetan rebellion and interfering in our internal affairs, supported the central government's measures to thoroughly quell the Tibetan rebellion, and resolutely demanded the transformation of the backward, dark, reactionary, and cruel serf system, the implementation of social reform, and enabling the Tibetan people to embark on the road to prosperity and strength.

Staff members of the Dalai's office in Beijing and the Panchen's office in Beijing marched side by side, constantly raising their arms and shouting: "The Tibetan people unite and strive to build a democratic socialist new Tibet!" Xirao Jimin, a Tibetan youth who returned from India's Kalimpong and personally witnessed the rebels engaging in various treasonous activities, participated in the capital's "May Day" parade for the first time today. He shouted with the indignant crowd: "Tibet is an inseparable part of China, smash the conspiracy of foreign interventionists to undermine China's unity!" Nangjie Zhuoga, a Tibetan youth whose uncle was abducted and aunt killed by Tibetan rebels, angrily shouted slogans today, condemning the heinous crimes committed by the rebels with the support of foreign reactionaries. Gongga Minjiu, a Tibetan cadre in the team, is a Tibetan youth with a glorious tradition of opposing imperialist aggression. His grandfather was wounded and died 55 years ago when he bravely fought back against British imperialist aggression in Jiangzi. This young man, angered by old and new hatreds, expressed his determination to inherit his grandfather's legacy and resolutely fight back against the heinous activities of British imperialism and Indian expansionists in interfering in our internal affairs. A Tibetan youth named Zhaxi Wangjiu excitedly cheered the great victory of the People's Liberation Army in quickly suppressing the rebellion. His father had guided the PLA in suppressing the bandits. He wrote home again yesterday, hoping that his father and brothers would better assist the People's Liberation Army, and at the same time, he determined to study hard and contribute to the construction of a new Tibet in the future.

A group of Tibetan youths came to Tiananmen Square to bid farewell to the great leader of all ethnic groups, Chairman Mao, and other Party and state leaders. They had completed their studies at the Central Institute for Nationalities and were about to return to their hometowns to participate in construction work. Qi Rendengba, an outstanding student, said: We will never fail the Party and the state's training, and we must contribute all our strength to build a democratic socialist new Tibet.

When the Tibetan youths of the Central Institute for Nationalities paraded, they sang aloud their self-composed songs against foreign interventionists. They sang: "Foreign reactionaries and imperialists, instigating the Tibetan rebellion, conspiring to undermine our country's unity, you have miscalculated and are looking at an outdated calendar. We warn you: any provocation against 600 million people will be resolutely repelled!" They also sang praises of the great Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao in front of Tiananmen Gate. They sang: "The great and wise leader Chairman Mao, leads the Tibetan people to socialism, the Liberation Army is the savior, eliminating the traitors, cheer! Praise the new life of the Tibetan people!"

Workers, peasants, and students participating in the demonstration parade also held signs and shouted slogans, opposing the British imperialists and Indian expansionists' instigation of the Tibetan rebellion and interference in China's internal affairs. The miners of the Dahua mining area of Jingxi Coal Mine, who overfulfilled the April production plan by 16% last night, issued a serious warning to foreign interventionists in front of Tiananmen Square today: "We have the strength to surpass Britain in production, and we also have the strength to smash the conspiracies and ambitions of foreign reactionaries who interfere in our internal affairs!" Wang Zhanlin, an elderly member of the Shijingshan People's Commune who had just condemned Indian expansionists in the fields a few days ago, raised his fist angrily during the parade today and said: "Indian expansionists, wake up, dreaming of splitting Tibet from China is a pipe dream, the 500 million peasants of the standing-up China are not easy to bully." He expressed his determination to produce more grain, support the construction of a new Tibet, and smash all the conspiracies of foreign reactionaries. The capital's students, who have a glorious tradition of the "May Fourth" Movement, their predecessors fought bravely here 40 years ago against foreign interventionists and domestic feudal forces. Today, they once again waved their fists in front of Tiananmen Gate to angrily denounce imperialism and foreign reactionaries.

The parade today also included builders of the Kangzang Highway, medical workers who had been to Tibet, and workers who directly manufactured farm tools for Tibet. With deep feelings, they shouted slogans during the parade, expressing their firm support for the Chinese People's Liberation Army to thoroughly quell the rebellion and fully support the construction of Tibet. Huang Tinglin, who had worked on the construction of the Kangzang Highway for more than three years, said excitedly: "The existence of the Kangzang Highway, jointly built by the Han and Tibetan people, shatters the lie of the Indian expansionists that 'independence' is the will of the Tibetan people." Workers from the Beijing Agricultural Machinery Factory, who have produced a large number of agricultural tools for Tibet, expressed that they will produce more and better products in the future to support Tibet, so that the Tibetan people can live a happier life and the border defense of the motherland can be built as solid as a wall.

Steelworkers carried a red three-dimensional sign that said "Vow to Seize 18 Million Tons." Six production experts from the three high-yield red banner units in the country—the No. 1 Ironmaking Plant of Benxi Iron and Steel Company, the Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant, and the Dalian Steel Plant—made a special trip to participate in the capital's parade. These six brave warriors in the battle to seize steel agreed with each other during the parade that they would work together and strive to meet again at the Hero Meeting before National Day in the battle to "seize 18 million tons of steel." The coal mine workers, who exceeded Britain's output of 270 million tons of coal last year, wrote a larger goal for this year on the red sign they held high: "Vow to Seize 380 Million Tons of Coal!" Various light and heavy industrial products, as well as models of new factories and tall residential buildings, appeared one after another in the workers' parade.

In the farmers' team, everywhere were cheers praising the goodness of the people's communes and striving for a great harvest this year. Elderly commune members played the music of "The People's Commune is Good" with national musical instruments. Women commune members held snow-white cotton bolls and golden wheat ears, dancing the harvest dance. Young commune members carried huge models of pigs, sheep, vegetables, grains, cotton, and fruits, symbolizing the prosperity of the people's commune's agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries.

In the parade of more than 100,000 intellectuals, professors, students, and scientific researchers used various models, specimens, and real objects to show their new achievements in transforming their thinking, implementing the Party's education policy, and climbing the peaks of science and technology.

The parading masses enthusiastically cheered the PLA viewing representatives from the heroic defense of the coast and shouted "We must liberate Taiwan!" "American troops get out of the Taiwan area!" Xia Xiude, lieutenant, a naval representative who severely damaged the Chiang Kai-shek's "Jiang" warship and shot down an enemy plane, excitedly said: "We will never fail the expectations of the people of the whole country."

Many huge balloons rose in the parade, with slogans such as "Long live world peace!" "Long live the great unity of the working class of the world!" "Long live the great unity of the people of the world!" The parading people constantly cheered and waved to the VIPs and international friends on the rostrum and viewing stands, thanking the working class and people of all countries for their support to our country. Friends of different skin colors from various countries showed great interest in the capital people's festival parade. They constantly waved or waved floral headscarves, cheering to the people to pay tribute. When the large balloons with the colorful slogan "Long live the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union!" rose into the sky, Fedorov, the head of the Soviet-Chinese Friendship Delegation waved his hand and repeatedly said: "Strength! Strength! Strength!" Kabba Mamadi, head of the Pan-African Trade Union Confederation delegation, saw people in the parade carrying the slogan "All forces against imperialism unite!" and said excitedly, we have common language, common ideas, only after driving away imperialism can all nations achieve true independence and democracy. The parading masses shouted: "Resolutely support the national liberation movements in Asia, Africa and Latin America!"

In the parade of the cultural army, the national unity dance became the focus of attention throughout the venue. Around the statue of Chairman Mao, countless red silks flew up and down. Han youths danced the Yangko, Mongolian youths performed the Ordos dance, Korean girls swung light veils, Uyghur girls played hand drums, Axi youths played the "Moon Jumping" with stringed instruments, and Tibetan young men and women waved long sleeves to celebrate their hometown—Tibet—beginning to embark on the bright road to prosperity and happiness.

The sports team, composed of more than 10,000 people, marched in high spirits. They formed a rocket-style formation, performing many sports programs—table tennis, weightlifting, swimming, and other wonderful actions, indicating that the level of sports in our country is leaping forward at rocket speed.

Also participating in today's parade were teams from agencies, science, industry and commerce, street residents, and Young Pioneers.

At one o'clock in the afternoon, the entire parade passed through Tiananmen Square. Suddenly, a sea of flags and flowers appeared under Tiananmen Gate. Tens of thousands of Young Pioneers and state agency cadres gathered here and cheered for a long time: "Long live the People's Republic of China!" "Long live the Chinese Communist Party!"

    游行示威队伍里升起许多巨大的气球，上边带着“世界和平万岁！”
  “全世界工人阶级大团结万岁！”“全世界人民大团结万岁！”的标语。游行的人们不断向主席台、观礼台上的贵宾和国际友人们欢呼、招手，感谢各国工人阶级和人民对我国的支援。不同肤色的各国朋友们对首都人民的节日游行表示极大的兴趣，他们不断招手或挥舞着花头巾，向人们欢呼致意。当大气球带着“以苏联为首的社会主义阵营团结万岁！”的彩色字标升上天空时，苏中友好代表团团长费多罗夫挥着手连声说：“力量！力量！力量！”黑非洲总工会代表团团长卡巴·玛玛弟看到游行的人们抬着“一切反对帝国主义的力量团结起来！”的标语，兴奋地说，我们有着共同的语言、共同的思想，只有赶走帝国主义，各民族才能取得真正的独立和民主。游行的群众高呼：“坚决支持亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的民族解放运动！”
