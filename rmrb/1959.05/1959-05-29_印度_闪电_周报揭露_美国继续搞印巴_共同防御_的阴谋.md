Xinhua News Agency, 28th: New Delhi dispatch: The Indian "Blitz" weekly recently published an article by Chander, exposing the US's continued activities in an attempt to rope India and Pakistan into establishing a so-called "joint defense."

The article said, "Nehru answered 'no' to the proposal to establish a joint defense on the Indian subcontinent, and Washington was disappointed by this," it pointed out, because the United States put forward this proposal.

The article said, "But the United States has not given up its plan. Former US Ambassador to Moscow, Harriman, recently told the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, 'We must find a way to use the military forces of the two countries for the joint defense of this subcontinent.'"

The article said, "On the one hand, Washington is inciting Pakistan to continue to publicize the same line, that is, to continue to express its eagerness to 'get closer' to India in order to achieve some kind of joint defense.

"On the other hand, anti-China elements have launched a whispering campaign (which can be clearly heard among diplomats in Delhi, Karachi, London, and Washington), saying that India will soon take steps, such as joint defense with Pakistan, to defend the more than two thousand miles of undefended border with China."

The author said, "US officials will continue to remain silent, otherwise their masks will be exposed. It and some other Western countries are eager for Sino-Indian relations not to return to the healthy and vigorous state of the past, therefore, they will continue to maintain fervor to expand any differences between India and China, whether these differences are imagined or real."

The author added, "India's pro-American parliamentarians are also busy. First, they are doing everything possible to launch harsh criticisms of China in the People's House and the Federal House." The article pointed out that India's pro-American parliamentarians are "organizing 'all-party' meetings and joint rallies - with more meetings to follow - to emphasize 'China's intransigence' and demand that the Dalai Lama be able to 'freely' participate in political 'battles'. A signature campaign has been launched, asking people to sign memorandums condemning China in preparation for submission to the Indian government." "These pro-American parliamentarians are worried that these 'harmless steps' may not have any effect. So they are planning to 'aid' Tibetan refugees on a large scale, and several US agencies have already donated various materials. It is hoped that these refugees will eventually join 'some people' here to promote the 'Tibetan cause'."

### 印度“闪电”周报揭露  美国继续搞印巴“共同防御”的阴谋

    印度“闪电”周报揭露
    美国继续搞印巴“共同防御”的阴谋
    新华社28日讯　新德里消息：印度“闪电”周报最近发表了钱德尔所写的一篇文章，揭露美国正在继续活动，企图拉拢印度和巴基斯坦建立所谓“共同防御”。
    文章说，“尼赫鲁以‘不’字回答在印度次大陆建立共同防御的建议，对这件事感到失望的是华盛顿”，它指出，因为提出这项建议的是美国。
    文章说，“但是美国并没有放弃它的计划。前美国驻莫斯科大使哈里曼最近在参议院外交委员会上说，“我们必须设法使两国的军事力量用在对这个次大陆的共同防御上。’”
    文章说，“一方面，华盛顿正在煽动巴基斯坦继续宣传同样的路线，那就是，继续表示它迫切希望‘更加接近’印度，以便实现某种联合防御。
    “另一方面，反华分子已经开展一种窃窃私议的运动（这在德里、卡拉奇、伦敦和华盛顿的外交人士中都可以清楚地听见），说印度不久将采取步骤，例如同巴基斯坦进行共同防御，以保卫同中国接壤的两千多英里的没遮拦的边境。”
    作者说，“美国官方将继续保持沉默，不然它的假面具就被揭穿。它和其他一些西方国家渴望印中关系不会恢复过去那种健康的和生气勃勃的状态，因此，将要继续保持狂热，来扩大印度和中国之间的任何分歧，不管这种分歧是想像的或是真的。”
    作者又说，“印度的亲美议员也很忙。首先他们尽一切力量在人民院和联邦院对中国进行尖刻的批评。”文章指出，印度的亲美议员们“正在组织‘各党派’会议和联合集会——将有更多的会议紧接着举行——来强调‘中国的不妥协’和要求让达赖喇嘛可以‘自由地’参加政治‘战斗’。已经发起一个签名运动，要求人们在准备交给印度政府的谴责中国的备忘录上签名。”“这些亲美的议员担心这种‘无害的步骤’也许不会有什么效果。所以正在计划大规模地‘援助’西藏难民，有好些美国机构已经捐助各种物资。有人希望，这些难民最后将同这里的‘某些人’一起来宣传‘西藏的事业’。”
