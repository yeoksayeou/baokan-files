Cured Tobacco Exports are of High Value

The export of cured tobacco is of great significance for increasing national income and exchanging for construction materials. It is estimated that the total value of cured tobacco exported from 1950 to 1958 could be exchanged for more than 5 million tons of fertilizer; in Henan Province alone, the total value of cured tobacco exported during the first five-year plan could be exchanged for seven sets of complete equipment of the same scale as the Anshan Seamless Steel Tube Plant.

    烤烟出口价值高
    烤烟出口对增加国家收入，换回建设物资，有着重要的意义。据估计，从1950年到1958年出口烤烟的总值可换回五百多万吨肥田粉；仅河南一省，第一个五年计划期间出口的烤烟总值可以换回像鞍山无缝钢管厂同样规模的全套设备七套。
