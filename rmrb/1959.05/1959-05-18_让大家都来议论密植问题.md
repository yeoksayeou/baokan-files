Let Everyone Discuss the Issue of Close Planting
　　Zeng Zhi
　　During this busy period of spring sowing, summer harvesting, and preparation for summer planting, cadres and members of many people's communes are talking a lot about the issue of close planting. This proves that people attach great importance to and are very concerned about this issue. Why talk so much about this issue? First, from the perspective of the production season, sowing is the central task of spring production, and sowing naturally involves the question of how much to sow, whether to sow sparsely or densely. Second, from the perspective of implementing the "Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture," having deeply plowed the land last year, with further improvements in water conservancy conditions this year, and with more meticulous and sufficient preparatory work for fertilizers, seeds, etc. than last year, the "density" aspect has become a key issue in increasing production. Third, many places increased production last year due to reasonable close planting, while a very few plots had lower yield increases or even decreased yields due to unreasonable close planting. People have gained extremely valuable experiences and lessons, and naturally, they will refer to these experiences and lessons in this year's production. Therefore, how to implement "density" has naturally become a central focus of people's attention and discussion.

　　What opinions do the masses have about close planting? As long as every cadre pays attention, they can hear roughly the following opinions: Some people firmly advocate close planting and believe that the denser, the better; some people advocate sparse planting, believing that close planting will reduce production; and some people affirm that close planting can increase production, but feel that too much density is not good. As for how much density is considered reasonable, some of them have experience gained under various different conditions, while others are unsure. These opinions roughly represent the views of young, old, and middle-aged farmers on the issue of close planting. Young farmers lack practical production experience, but they are more sensitive to new things and are willing to accept new technologies; however, due to a lack of practical experience, they also have a bit of blindness. Elderly farmers have rich production and life experience, but the influence of the small-scale peasant economy and the influence of the habit of sparse planting for many years make them somewhat resistant to new technologies. Middle-aged farmers have some production and life experience and are also influenced by some old habits. Therefore, they are more cautious in dealing with problems and accepting new things than young people, and their reactions are not as quick. However, because they are less influenced by the old ways than the elderly, they are more receptive to new technologies. It can be said that these three types of people each have their strengths and weaknesses. The leader's responsibility is to perfectly combine the strengths of all three.

　　Since close planting is a key issue in whether or not production can be increased this year, and it is related to the lives of everyone in the commune and the construction of the country, all commune members should be allowed to express their opinions, especially the elderly, middle-aged, and young people, who each have their own characteristics. Bringing these three types of people together to fully express their opinions allows leaders to prevent the one-sidedness that can arise from only listening to the opinions of one group of people, and it can inspire leaders to consider problems from various aspects and angles, enabling leading cadres to extract beneficial things for work and production from various different opinions, concentrate them, and correctly guide the masses to implement reasonable close planting. This is of great benefit to improving leadership skills. For the masses, they can also be educated and learn from each other's strengths through research and discussion.

    让大家都来议论密植问题
    曾志
    正在春播、夏收、准备夏种的大忙时期，许多人民公社的干部和社员都在大谈特谈密植问题。这证明人们对这个问题很重视、很关心。为什么要大谈这个问题呢？第一、从生产季节来说，播种正是春季生产的中心，要播种，自然就会涉及种多种少、种稀种密的问题。第二、从实行农业八字宪法来说，在去年已经深翻了土地，今年的水利条件已有进一步改善，肥料、种子等备耕工作又作得比去年更细致、更充分以后，“密”字在增产中就成了一个关键问题。第三、去年有许多地方因合理密植而增产，也有极少数地块因密植不合理而增产较少甚至减产，人们取得了极可贵的经验和教训，在今年的生产中自然要很好地参照这些经验和教训行事。因此，究竟怎样实行“密”字，自然便成为当前人们注意和议论的一个中心了。
    关于密植，群众中究竟有些什么意见呢？只要每个干部留心，大约都可以听到这样几种意见：有一部分人坚决主张密植，并且认为愈密愈好；有一部分人则主张稀植，认为密植要减产；还有一部分人肯定密植可以增产，但是觉得太密了也不好，究竟要多密才算合理，他们之中有的人有在各种不同的条件下得到的经验，有的人则拿不定主意。这些意见，大体上代表了青年、老年和中年农民对密植问题的看法。青年农民缺少实际的生产经验，但是他们对新鲜事物的感觉比较锐敏，勇于接受新技术；因为缺少实际经验，又带有一点盲目性。老年农民有丰富的生产经验和生活经验，但是多年来小农经济的影响，稀植的习惯势力的影响，使他们对新技术又有一定程度的抵触。中年农民有一定的生产、生活经验，也受了一些旧的习惯势力的影响，因此，他们在处理问题、接受新事物时较青年人谨慎，反应没有那样快；但是，由于他们受旧的影响较老年人为少，所以他们又比较容易接受新技术。可以说，这三种人都各有短长，领导者的责任就是把三者的长处完善地集中起来。
    密植既然是今年能否增产的关键问题，关系到公社每个人的生活和国家的建设，当然应该让所有的社员群众都来发表意见，特别是要让各有特点的老年、中年、青年人都来发表意见。让这三种人聚于一堂充分发表意见，对于领导来说，既可以防止因只听某一部分人的意见而产生的片面性，又可以启发领导从各个方面、各个角度来考虑问题，使领导干部从各种不同的意见中，汲取到对工作、对生产有益的东西，集中起来，正确地领导群众实行合理密植。这对于提高领导水平大有好处。对于群众来说，也可以通过研究议论，互相受到教育，互相取长补短。
