Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, May 23rd: According to TASS, the spokesman of the Soviet delegation made a statement at a press conference held at the Geneva Press Club on the evening of May 22, reiterating the Soviet Union's firm position that Poland and Czechoslovakia should fully participate in the meeting, and expressed the hope that the Foreign Ministers' meeting would soon be able to resolve this issue well.

The statement said that the Soviet government had already raised the issue of the foreign ministers of Poland and Czechoslovakia participating in the meeting in its correspondence with the United States, Britain, and France regarding the convening of the Geneva Foreign Ministers' Meeting. Afterwards, the statement said, at the beginning of the Foreign Ministers' Meeting and at the meetings on May 12 and 13, the Soviet delegation again suggested with convincing reasons that the issue of Poland and Czechoslovakia participating in the already-opened Foreign Ministers' Meeting be actively resolved. The Western delegations refused to pass any resolutions on this issue, their excuse being merely that it was appropriate to discuss this issue later.

The statement said that in the past week, when the issue of a peace treaty with Germany began to be discussed at the meeting, the Soviet delegation once again firmly proposed in the talks that the issue of Poland and Czechoslovakia fully participating in the meeting be resolved. However, the U.S., British, and French delegations still refused to resolve this issue now.

The statement finally emphasized that the Soviet delegation deemed it necessary to declare that there was no reason to continue delaying the resolution of this issue, which was of great significance to the people of Poland and Czechoslovakia and to the success of the meeting. The Soviet delegation hoped that this issue would be resolved well in the near future.

    苏联代表团发言人声明
    再次主张波捷应参加外长会议
    新华社23日讯　据塔斯社日内瓦讯：苏联代表团发言人22日晚上在日内瓦记者之家举行的记者招待会上发表声明，重申苏联关于波兰和捷克斯洛伐克完全参加会议的坚决主张，并希望外长会议最近能很好地解决这个问题。
    声明说，苏联政府在就召开日内瓦外长会议同美、英、法三国的交往信件中，早就提出波兰和捷克斯洛伐克的外交部长参加这次会议的问题。之后，声明说，在外长会议开始时以及在5月12日和13日的会议上，苏联代表团又以令人信服的理由建议积极解决波兰和捷克斯洛伐克参加已经开幕的外长会议的问题。西方国家代表团拒绝就这个问题通过任何决议，它们的借口仅仅是，在以后讨论这个问题是适宜的。
    声明说，最近一周，当在会议上开始讨论对德和约问题的时候，苏联代表团在会谈中再一次坚决提议解决波兰和捷克斯洛伐克完全参加会议的问题。但是，美、英、法代表团仍然拒绝在现在解决这个问题。
    声明最后强调说，苏联代表团认为有必要声明，没有任何理由继续拖延解决这个对波、捷两国人民和对会议是否成功具有重要意义的问题。苏联代表团希望在最近很好地解决这个问题。
