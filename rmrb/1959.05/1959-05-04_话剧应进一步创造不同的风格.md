Comrade Chairman and fellow committee members:

I wholeheartedly endorse the reports of the leading comrades. Premier Zhou Enlai's "Government Work Report" reflects the glorious achievements of our 600 million people under the leadership of the Party, is a great epic, a summary of the Great Leap Forward, and a resounding bugle call to encourage us to strive for even greater leaps forward.

Premier Zhou pointed out earnestly regarding the tasks on our cultural and educational front: "We believe that after the free debate of different schools and different opinions in science, and the free competition of different forms and different styles in art, it will not be long before our scientific and cultural undertakings will enter a prosperous era and achieve great accomplishments." This instruction has given me great inspiration.

Recently, our drama circles have been discussing how to further improve the quality of drama. As a drama worker, I would like to offer some personal opinions on this aspect for your correction.

Drama is one of the "hundred flowers," the most timely art form that reflects reality and is the most combative. This flower has been growing and gradually strengthening under the care and support of the Party. Especially in the past ten years, the Party and the government have given great opportunities for the development of the drama cause. Each province and city in the country has established one or several drama troupes and theaters, which regularly perform dramas, and have also established two colleges specializing in training drama talents—the Central Academy of Drama and the Shanghai Theater Academy—which have cultivated many new forces for the drama circles. In order to transform ourselves and to cooperate with the Great Leap Forward in industry and agriculture, our drama workers, like comrades of other fraternal opera types, have gone deep into the countryside and factories to train and perform, and have achieved remarkable results.

However, our work still lags far behind the objective needs. The people need not only more dramas, but also better dramas. Therefore, the question of how to further improve the quality of drama urgently needs to be resolved. This issue involves a wide range of aspects, and political command, going deep into life, and studying skills should all be our primary tasks. If politics are not in command, we will lose our direction; if we do not go deep into life, our content will be empty and we will fall into the mire of formalism; if we do not master skilled techniques, our works and performances will not be captivating. Refined techniques come from healthy thoughts and a rich life.

In addition, I believe that we should further promote the creation of different styles. Scripts should have different styles. Performances should also have different styles. With scripts of different styles, performances of different styles can be produced. Even if it is the same script, if performed by two troupes, they should create different performance styles. Otherwise, there is a lack of creativity and it is easy to fall into plagiarism. Although the peony is a single flower, it has distinctions such as "Yao Yellow," "Wei Purple," and "Zhao Pink." Why shouldn't our drama have more diverse styles?

In order to promote the creation of different styles of drama, I propose the following suggestions:

1. Each drama troupe should form its own unique artistic style. Of course, this style must be formed under the guidance of Marxism-Leninism, or in line with the further development of Marxist-Leninist aesthetics.

2. Each drama troupe should have its own playwright (or specially invited playwright), director, actors, and its own repertoire.

3. Regions and troupes should vigorously carry out "free competition of different styles."

4. The drama artists should be guaranteed time to study politics, study their profession (diligently cultivate and practice hard), and go deep into life. On the one hand, they should have time for collective study and training, and on the other hand, they should also have opportunities for independent thinking and personal reading.

5. Beijing or Shanghai should have a theater dedicated to performing foreign classical plays.

6. We should learn to walk on two legs. On the one hand, we should learn from our own rich and colorful drama art and from the drama traditions of the past fifty years. On the other hand, we should also learn from the progressive drama art of foreign countries. First of all, we should learn from the Soviet Union.

I firmly believe that under the leadership of the Party and the government, and with the joint efforts of the comrades in the drama circles, the flower of drama will surely bloom in a myriad of colors and become more fresh and brilliant in the future.

Finally, like the people of the whole country, I express my boundless anger at the treasonous crimes committed by the Tibetan reactionary clique in collusion with imperialism, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and foreign reactionaries! I issue a serious warning to the expansionists in India and pay the highest respect and deepest gratitude to the heroic People's Liberation Army that quelled the rebellion.

### 话剧应进一步创造不同的风格

    话剧应进一步创造不同的风格
    熊佛西委员的发言主席团、各位委员：
    我衷心拥护各位首长的报告。周恩来总理的“政府工作报告”反映了我们六亿人民在党的领导下冲天干劲的辉煌成就，是一篇伟大的史诗，是大跃进的总结，也是鼓舞我们争取更大跃进的响亮号角。
    周总理在有关我们文化教育战线上的任务方面这样恳切地指出：“我们相信，经过科学上不同学派、不同见解的自由争论，艺术上不同形式、不同风格的自由竞赛，不要很久，我们的科学文化事业一定能够进入一个昌盛的时代，并且获得伟大的成就。”这个指示更给了我极大的启发。
    最近我们话剧界正在讨论如何进一步提高话剧的质量问题。我是一个话剧工作者，现在，也就这方面提出些个人的看法，请指正。
    话剧是“百花”中的一种，是最能及时反映现实、最富战斗性的艺术，这朵花一直是在党的关怀与扶植下成长起来的，并且逐渐壮大起来了。特别是近十年来，党和政府对于话剧事业给了极大的发展机会，全国各省市都成立了一个或数个话剧团院，经常公演话剧，并且还创立了两个专门培养话剧人材的学院——中央戏剧学院和上海戏剧学院，为话剧界培养了很多生力军。为了改造我们自己，为了配合工农业的大跃进，我们话剧工作者也和其它兄弟剧种的同志们一样，深入到农村、工厂，锻炼、演出，获得了显著的成绩。
    但是我们的工作还远远落后于客观的需要。人民不但需要更多的话剧，而且需要更好的话剧。所以，如何进一步提高话剧的质量的问题，就迫切地需要解决。这个问题涉及的方面很广，政治挂帅，深入生活，钻研技巧等都应该是我们首要的课题。政治不挂帅，我们就会迷失方向；不深入生活，我们便内容空虚，会陷入形式主义的泥坑；不掌握熟练的技巧，我们的作品和演出则不能引人入胜，技巧不能孤立地去钻研，必须和思想、生活密切地结合起来进行。精炼的技巧乃来自健康的思想、丰富的生活。
    此外，我认为我们应该进一步提倡不同风格的创造。剧本应有不同的风格。演出也要有不同的风格。有了不同风格的剧本，便能产生不同风格的演出。即是同一个剧本，假使由两个剧团演出，也应该创造不同的演出风格。否则，便缺乏创造性。甚至易于流入抄袭。牡丹虽是一种花，但是它也有“姚黄”、“魏紫”、
  “赵粉”之别，为什么我们话剧不应有更多种多样的风格呢？
    为了促进话剧不同风格的创造，我提出如下的建议：
    1、每个话剧团院应形成自己独特的艺术风格。当然，这种风格必须是在马列主义指导下形成的，或是符合马列主义美学进一步发展的。
    2、每个话剧团院应有自己的剧作家（或特约的剧作家）、导演、演员和自己的保留节目。
    3、地域与地域之间、剧团院之间，应大力开展“不同风格的自由竞赛”。
    4、对于话剧的艺术人员应保证他们学习政治、钻研业务（勤修苦练）、深入生活的时间。一方面使他们有集体学习、锻炼的时间，另方面也有独立思考、个人读书的机会。
    5、北京或上海应有一个专演外国古典剧的剧院。
    6、我们应学会两条腿走路的本事，一方面向我们自己丰富多彩的戏剧艺术学习，向五十年来的话剧传统学习，另方面也要向外国的进步戏剧艺术学习。首先是向苏联学习。
    我深信，在党和政府的领导下，话剧界的同志们共同努力下，话剧这朵花今后必会开得万紫千红，更加清新灿烂。
    最后，和全国人民一样，我向西藏反动集团勾结帝国主义、蒋介石匪帮和外国反动派发动的叛国罪行表示无比的愤怒！向印度的扩张主义分子给予严正的警告并向平息叛乱的英勇的人民解放军致以崇高的敬意和深切的谢意。
