　　In-depth discussions on commodity production and the law of value
　　The Guangzhou Institute of Philosophy and Social Sciences of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Guangdong Economic Society, and the editorial department of "Theory and Practice" recently jointly held four seminars at the Guangdong Science Museum to discuss issues related to commodity production and the law of value under the socialist system. Those attending included leading cadres and staff from financial and economic institutions, industrial enterprise managers, social science researchers, political theory teachers from universities and cadre schools, and members of the Guangdong Economic Society, totaling more than 400 participants. The focus of the debate was on the reasons for the existence of commodity production under China's socialist system, whether the means of production mutually allocated within China's system of ownership by the whole people are commodities, and the role of the law of value under the socialist system. The comrades who spoke at the meeting had different views on the above issues. A summary of the various opinions is as follows:
    I. Reasons for the Existence of Commodity Production Under China's Socialist System
    Regarding this question, the comrades who spoke had the following different views: Some comrades believed that the existence of commodity production is a reflection of social relations of production under certain productive forces. The reasons for the existence of commodity production in China at the present stage are determined by the characteristics of socialist relations of production that are suitable for the level of development of China's productive forces, namely: 1. The existence of two forms of socialist ownership makes commodity production and commodity circulation a necessary form of economic ties in China at the present stage. This is the main reason for the existence of commodity production in China. 2. State-owned enterprises and people's communes in China both implement a system of distribution according to labor. In order to better implement the principle of distribution according to labor, it is necessary to use commodity exchange and monetary wages to stimulate the increase of labor productivity. This factor will become prominent as an important factor for the continued existence of commodity production in the future when ownership by the whole people is fully realized.
    Some comrades believe that the economic category of commodity reflects the relations of production between different owners. Without this main feature, true commodity production does not exist. Therefore, the basis for the existence of commodity production under the socialist system is: (1) two forms of socialist ownership; (2) foreign trade relations; (3) the system of distribution according to labor; (4) the economic accounting system of socialist enterprises.
    Some comrades disagree with the above two opinions, believing that the fundamental reason for the existence of commodity production under China's socialist system is entirely due to the insufficient level of industrial and agricultural productive forces. The reasons are: (1) The existence of collective ownership is a manifestation of low productivity. If it is considered that the existence of two forms of ownership is the reason for the existence of commodity production under China's socialist system, then when collective ownership is completely transitioned to ownership by the whole people, commodity production will no longer exist, which is obviously not in line with China's actual situation. (2) The existence of the system of distribution according to labor is determined by the level of development of productive forces and the quantity of social products. In China's socialist period, due to the low level of development of productive forces, the principle of distribution according to labor and commodity-money relations are used to adjust the contradiction between production and consumption. If it is said that distribution according to labor determines the existence of commodity production, it is putting the cart before the horse. (3) The implementation of economic accounting by socialist enterprises is also directly related to the level of development of productive forces. Because the production technology levels of various enterprises in China are different, with mechanization, semi-mechanization, and manual operation, it is impossible to directly calculate labor consumption by time, but only to use the value form to indirectly calculate the labor consumption of products. After the full realization of mechanization and electrification, the production technology levels of various enterprises will be consistent, and it will be possible to directly calculate labor consumption by time. It can be seen that the implementation of economic accounting is also not the reason for the existence of commodity production. Some people also argue from the point of view that retaining commodity production and commodity circulation is conducive to the development of socialist productive forces in China, to the development of people's commune production, and to solving the contradiction between production and people's consumption, to prove that the level of development of productive forces is the reason for the existence of commodity production in China.
    Some comrades believe that we should explore the reasons for the existence of commodity production under China's socialist system from both the productive forces and the relations of production. The reasons are: (1) Due to the existence of two forms of public ownership, the state cannot directly allocate the commodities of the people's communes without compensation, but must carry out commodity exchange. Because the current level of rural productive forces is still very low, the state cannot immediately unify the production and consumption of the people's communes, and must carry out distribution through commodity exchange. (2) Due to the current low level of productive forces, it is impossible to implement distribution according to need; also due to the socialist system itself, it is necessary to use commodity production and commodity exchange to better implement the principle of distribution according to labor.
    Some comrades believe that as long as the socialist mode of production exists, commodity production and commodity circulation will inevitably exist. Because (1) the socialist mode of production itself requires that each grassroots economic unit in various departments of the national economy must implement economic accounting; (2) the socialist mode of production determines that its form of product distribution is distribution according to labor; it also determines that its form of product exchange is commodity exchange. As long as the socialist mode of production has not changed, its distribution and exchange methods cannot be changed separately.
    II. Whether the Means of Production Allocated Internally Under Ownership by the Whole People are Commodities Under the Socialist System
    Regarding this issue, there are basically two different opinions in the discussion. The first opinion is that the means of production allocated between various enterprises within the system of ownership by the whole people are not commodities in the true sense, but only have the form or shell of commodities. The reason is that these means of production and these enterprises themselves are all owned by the whole people. This kind of allocation only reflects the production ties between enterprises owned by the whole people, and does not reflect the relations of production between different owners.
    Many comrades disagree with the above opinion, believing that the means of production mutually allocated between enterprises owned by the whole people are commodities both in form and in substance. The reasons are: (1) All means of production produced by state-owned enterprises are not produced for their own needs, but for the needs of society and other economic units; (2) Although these means of production are allocated between various enterprises according to the state plan, they must be calculated in value, settled through currency, and generally abide by the principle of equivalent exchange; (3) The means of production are ultimately used to produce consumer goods, and their value will ultimately be transferred to consumer goods. Then the means of production should also be recognized as commodities. Individual comrades even believe that not only are the means of production allocated between state-owned enterprises commodities, but even the means of production mutually used by various workshops within the enterprise, as long as they are still calculated in value and settled in currency, are also commodities.
    III. The Role of the Law of Value Under the Socialist System
    Regarding this issue, the discussion mainly focused on the following issues: What are the functions of the law of value? What is its main function under the socialist system? Can it play a regulatory role in socialist production? Opinions in the discussion were very inconsistent, and can be summarized into the following five categories:
    The first opinion is that the role of the law of value has general main roles and special roles. The general main roles of the law of value are two: (1) to stimulate the improvement of labor productivity and promote the development of production in commodity production; (2) to play the role of value regulating prices in commodity circulation. This general main role of the law of value exists under any commodity economic conditions, but the characteristics and consequences of the role are different under different economic conditions. The law of value also has different special roles under different conditions. Under the conditions of private ownership, the special roles of the law of value are: first, to act as a production regulator; second, to cause the generation and development of capitalist relations of production. Under the socialist system, the more significant special roles of the law of value are two: one is as a tool of planned economy; the other is as an economic accounting tool. In addition, under the socialist system, when our planning is not thorough enough, or when certain products are not included in the plan, the law of value will also play the role of production regulator. It is believed that in this case, the regulatory role of the law of value is not harmful. It can make up for the shortcomings of the planned economy and serve as a negative teacher to prompt us to improve our planning work.
    Some comrades in the second opinion believe that under China's socialist system, the effect of the law of value on production can be divided into two types: "regulation" and "influence". For the production of state-owned enterprises, the law of value generally does not play a regulatory role, because the production of these enterprises is carried out according to the state plan. However, the law of value still affects the production of state-owned enterprises, manifesting in these enterprises using the law of value to carry out economic accounting, to improve production, reduce costs, and to obtain profits. For the production of people's communes under collective ownership, the role of the law of value also has two situations, namely: for the production of major agricultural and sideline products included in the state plan, the law of value basically does not play a regulatory role, while for products that are not included in the state plan or whose plans are not thorough, the law of value plays a certain regulatory role. In addition, individual comrades believe that after the victory of the three major transformations and before the people's commune system, the law of value still played a regulatory role in production in individual cases. After the realization of the completely collective ownership of the people's commune, the regulatory role of the law of value on production will completely disappear.
    The third opinion is that the adjustment of commodity production and circulation by the law of value should not be equated with the entire role of the law of value, nor should it be regarded as the main role of the law of value. Those who hold this view believe that under the socialist system, the main feature of the role of the law of value does not lie in the adjustment of production and circulation, but in other aspects, namely: (1) playing a calculation role in the state-owned economy, including state planned economy, financial budget, final accounts, capital construction investment, cooperation between enterprises, internal accounting and profit of enterprises, etc.; (2) playing an equivalent role in the exchange relationship between the state and the commune; (3) playing a certain regulatory role in the circulation of personal consumer goods outside of the unified purchase and sales.
    The fourth opinion is that under any condition of commodity production, the most fundamental role of the law of value is the role of "regulator". The difference is that under the capitalist system, it plays a "spontaneous regulatory role", while under the socialist system, due to the constraints of the basic economic law of socialism and the law of planned and proportional development of the national economy, the law of value plays a "conscious regulatory role". Therefore, they believe that the law of value plays a regulatory role in both commodity production under ownership by the whole people and commodity production under collective ownership, but the degree is different.
    The fifth opinion is that individual comrades quoted individual sentences from Volume 3 of Marx's "Capital" and believed that the law of value fundamentally does not play the role of production regulator under any social conditions. Even under the capitalist system, the production regulator is not the law of value, but the law of surplus value, and also emphasized that if it is believed that value plays a regulatory role under the socialist system, it will inevitably deny the role of the basic economic law of socialism and the law of planned and proportional development of the national economy. Many comrades disagreed with this opinion.

　　广州学术界
    深入讨论商品生产和价值规律问题
    中国科学院广州哲学社会科学研究所、广东经济学会、“理论与实践”编辑部最近在广东科学馆先后联合举行四次座谈会，讨论有关社会主义制度下商品生产和价值规律问题。到会的有财经机关负责干部和职工、工业企业管理人员、社会科学研究人员、高等院校和干部学校的政治理论教师、广东经济学会会员等四百多人次。争论的焦点是在我国社会主义制度下商品生产存在的原因，我国全民所有制内部互相调拨的生产资料是不是商品，社会主义制度下价值规律的作用等问题。会上发言的同志对于上述问题的看法都有分歧，现将各种不同的意见综述如下：
    一、在我国社会主义制度下商品生产存在的原因
    关于这个问题，发言的同志有如下几种不同的看法：有些同志认为，商品生产的存在是一定的生产力条件下社会生产关系的反映。我国现阶段商品生产存在的原因，是由适合于我国生产力发展水平的社会主义生产关系的特点所决定，即：1．社会主义所有制的两种形式存在，使得商品生产与商品流通成为我国现阶段经济联系的必要形式，这是我国商品生产存在的主要原因。2．我国国营企业和人民公社都实行按劳分配制度，为了更好地实现按劳分配原则，就必须利用商品交换和货币工资的形式以利于刺激劳动生产率的提高。这个因素在将来全民所有制全面实现以后，将突出起来成为商品生产继续存在的重要因素。
    有的同志认为，商品这一经济范畴，反映不同的所有者之间的生产关系，离开了这一主要特征，真正的商品生产就不存在。因此社会主义制度下商品生产存在的根据是：（1）社会主义所有制的两种形式；（2）对外贸易关系；（3）按劳分配制度；（4）社会主义企业的经济核算制。
    有些同志不同意上述两种意见，认为我国社会主义制度下商品生产存在的根本原因，完全是因为工农业生产力水平不够高。理由是：（1）集体所有制的存在，是生产力不高的表现。如果认为所有制的两种形式存在，是我国社会主义制度下商品生产存在的原因，那么等到集体所有制都过渡到全民所有制以后，商品生产就不再存在了，这显然不符合我国实际情况。（2）按劳分配制度的存在，是由生产力的发展水平和社会产品的数量所决定，在我国社会主义时期，由于生产力发展水平还不高，才利用按劳分配原则和商品货币关系来调节生产和消费之间的矛盾。如果说按劳分配决定商品生产的存在，那是本末倒置。（3）社会主义企业实行经济核算制，也是与生产力发展水平有直接关系的，由于我国目前各种不同企业的生产技术水平不同，有机械化、有半机械化、也有手工操作，因而不能直接用时间来计算劳动耗费，而只能运用价值形式迂回曲折地去计算产品劳动的耗费。在全面实现机械化、电气化以后，各个企业的生产技术水平一致，就可以直接用时间去计算劳动的耗费，可见实行经济核算制，也不是商品生产存在的原因。有人还从保留商品生产和商品流通，有利于我国社会主义生产力的发展，有利于人民公社生产的发展和有利于解决生产与人民消费之间的矛盾，来反证生产力的发展水平是我国商品生产存在的原因。
    部分同志认为，应该同时从生产力和生产关系两个方面去探讨我国社会主义制度下商品生产存在的原因。理由是：（1）由于公有制两种形式的存在，使得国家不能无代价的直接调拨人民公社的商品，而必须通过商品交换，由于目前农村生产力水平还很低，国家不能马上把人民公社的生产和消费统一包起来，必须通过商品交换来进行分配。（2）由于现有的生产力水平还很低，不能实行按需分配；也由于社会主义制度本身，必须通过商品生产和商品交换来更好地实行按劳分配的原则。
    有些同志认为：社会主义生产方式存在，商品生产和商品流通就必然存在。因为（1）社会主义生产方式本身要求，国民经济各个部门的每个基层经济单位，都要实行经济核算；（2）社会主义生产方式决定了它的产品分配的形式是按劳分配；也决定了它的产品交换的形式是商品交换。只要社会主义生产方式还没有改变，它的分配方式和交换方式就不能单独改变。
    二、在社会主义制度下全民所有制内部调拨的生产资料是否商品
    关于这个问题，在讨论中基本上有两种不同的意见。第一种意见认为在全民所有制内部各个企业之间调拨的生产资料，不是真正意义的商品，而只是具有商品的形式或外壳，理由是：这些生产资料和这些企业本身都为全民所有，这种调拨，只反映全民所有制企业之间的生产联系，并不反映不同所有者之间的生产关系。
    许多同志不同意上述意见，他们认为全民所有制企业之间互相调拨的生产资料不论形式上实质上都是商品。理由是：（1）一切国营企业所生产的生产资料，都不是为了自己的需要而生产，而是为了供应社会和其他经济单位的需要而生产；（2）这些生产资料虽然根据国家计划在各个企业之间进行调拨，但是都要计算价值，要通过货币来清算，并且一般要遵守等价交换原则；（3）生产资料最终是用来生产消费品的，其价值最终要转移到消费品中去。那么生产资料也应该承认它是商品。有个别同志甚至认为：不仅国营企业之间调拨的生产资料是商品，连在企业内部各个车间互相调用的生产资料，只要还计算价值，进行货币结算，也同样是商品。
    三、社会主义制度下价值规律的作用
　　关于这个问题，在讨论中争论比较集中于这样一些问题上：价值规律究竟有哪些作用？它在社会主义制度下主要的作用是什么？它对社会主义的生产能否起调节作用？讨论中意见很不一致，概括起来有如下五种：
    第一种意见认为：价值规律的作用有一般的主要的作用和特殊作用之分。价值规律的一般的主要的作用有二：（1）在商品生产中起刺激劳动生产率提高和促进生产发展的作用；（2）在商品流通中起价值调节价格的作用。价值规律这种一般的主要的作用，在任何商品经济条件下都存在，只是在不同的经济条件下，作用的特点和后果不同而已。价值规律在不同的条件下还有不同的特殊作用。在私有制条件下，价值规律的特殊作用，一是充当生产调节者；二是引起资本主义生产关系产生和发展。在社会主义制度下价值规律的特殊作用较显著的有两种：一是作为计划经济的工具；二是作为经济核算工具。此外，在社会主义制度下，当我们计划不够周详，或者某些产品没有纳入计划的时候，价值规律还会起生产调节者的作用，并认为在这情况下，价值规律的调节作用并无坏处，它可以补计划经济之不足，作为一个反面教员来促使我们改进计划工作。
    第二种意见中的一部分同志认为，在我国社会主义制度下，价值规律对于生产的作用，可以分为“调节”作用和“影响”作用二种。对于国营企业的生产价值规律一般不起调节作用，因为这些企业的生产按照国家计划进行。但价值规律还影响国营企业的生产。表现于这些企业利用价值规律进行经济核算，来改进生产，降低成本，以获得赢利。对于集体所有制的人民公社的生产，价值规律的作用也有两种情况，即：对纳入国家计划的主要农副产品的生产，价值规律基本上不起调节作用，而对于没有纳入国家计划或计划不周的产品，则价值规律起一定的调节作用。此外也有个别同志认为：在三大改造胜利后，人民公社化以前，价值规律在个别情况下还起调节生产的作用。而在完全的人民公社集体所有制实现后，价值规律对生产的调节作用就根本消失了。
    第三种意见认为：不能把价值规律调节商品生产与流通，同价值规律的全部作用等同起来，也不能把它看作是价值规律的主要作用。持这种意见的人认为在社会主义制度下，价值规律作用的主要特征不在于调节生产和流通的作用，而在于其他方面，即：（1）在国营经济中起计算作用，包括国家计划经济中财政预算，决算，基本建设投资，企业之间的协作，企业内部的核算和赢利等等；（2）在国家和公社的交换关系中起等价作用；（3）在统购统销以外的个人消费品流通中，起一定的调节作用。
    第四种意见认为：在任何商品生产的条件下价值规律的最根本的作用就是“调节者”的作用，不同的是在资本主义制度下起“自发性的调节作用”，而在社会主义制度下，由于受社会主义基本经济规律和国民经济有计划按比例发展规律的约制，价值规律起“自觉性的调节作用”。因此他们认为价值规律，不论对全民所有制的或集体所有制的商品生产，都起调节作用，只是程度大小不一样。
    第五种意见是个别同志引用马克思“资本论”第三卷的个别词句，认为价值规律在任何社会条件下，都根本不起生产调节者作用，即使在资本主义制度下，生产调节者也不是价值规律，而是剩余价值规律，并且还强调说，如果认为在社会主义制度下，价值起调节作用，就必然否认社会主义基本经济规律和国民经济有计划按比例发展规律的作用。许多同志都不同意这种意见。
