International Briefs

    Cabinet Crisis Developing in Ceylon
    Colombo dispatch: Six members of the ruling party in Ceylon submitted letters to Prime Minister Bandaranaike on the 19th announcing their withdrawal from the ruling party's parliamentary group. These six include Karunatilake, Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Finance, Fernando, Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Agriculture and Food, and P. Seneviratne, former Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives. This is a new development in the Ceylon cabinet crisis following the withdrawal of the Revolutionary Equal Society Party leader and Minister of Agriculture, Gunawardena, and the Minister of Industry, de Silva, from the cabinet, and the withdrawal of three other members of this party from the government's parliamentary group. Their resignation was due to disagreement with Prime Minister Bandaranaike's concessions to right-wing ministers, refusing to revoke the decision to adjust institutions affiliated with some ministries of the cabinet.
