　　“The Motherland Gave Me Wings”
　　Hu Huiling
    To fly into the sky, soaring in the boundless blue, is a fantasy almost everyone has in their childhood. But how difficult it is to realize!
    In the area inhabited by the Kazakh ethnic group on the northwestern border of the motherland, there is a saying: "No matter how good your fortune or how strong your ability, you can't fly into the sky." After liberation, although the herdsmen here took off the sheepskins they wore all year round and put on cotton clothes; although they ended their wandering lives of homelessness and moved into tiled houses; although banks, supply and marketing cooperatives, and people's communes were established here; this saying continued to circulate.
    They had never even seen an airplane, only seeing the shape of an airplane in textbooks after liberation.
    But who could have imagined that in this place, a young man named Keshayin would be recommended to learn gliding? Gliding is the beginning of flight, and you can soar in the sky by piloting a glider. Keshayin simply thought he was the happiest person in the world. However, when he rushed to the Urumqi Aviation Club to register, he found so many people, wearing all kinds of ethnic costumes and speaking different ethnic languages, and even girls with long braids!
    Keshayin and his companions were so excited that they couldn't sleep for several nights. Finally, they decided to write a letter to the newspaper to thank Chairman Mao and the Communist Party for always remembering the minority nationalities. After writing this letter, Keshayin still felt that his enthusiasm was not fully expressed, so he wrote another letter. From then on, a new proverb appeared in his hometown: "Don't rely on luck, rely only on ability, follow our Party, and you will surely reach the heaven."
    In fact, it was not just Keshayin and the people in his hometown who were so excited! For the people of the whole country, this was also a new thing. Gliding is a newly emerging sport that has gradually developed since liberation. Riding a glider, people can freely roam in the sky. This is a great joy and happiness for young people who are eager to go to the sky!
    Nowadays, whenever the weather is clear and a bit of red shines through the east, gliders are flying in the sky above the airports of aviation clubs all over the country. Bright red, orange, orange, beige, all kinds of gliders, lightly and silently roaming in the blue sky. It is hard to believe without seeing it with your own eyes that the people sitting on them and operating these magical birds are mostly under twenty years old.
    This is a beige two-seater glider with a soaring crane painted on its tail. After it rises into the sky, the crane disappears, but a more beautiful and graceful image appears in front of us. In the rays of the morning sun, the glider is flying steadily and deftly. Suddenly it raises its head upwards, leaning back rapidly, making a big somersault, and then making several consecutive somersaults upwards. Just as everyone was marveling, it rushed down towards the sun, like a kite with a broken string, or like an autumn leaf; before everyone could catch their breath, it floated up against the wind again, so leisurely and contented, which was fascinating. Finally, it landed like a dragonfly skimming the water. The cockpit cover opened, revealing two red smiling faces, like children. These are a male student and a female instructor, about the same age, but the instructor is a head shorter than the student. As soon as they got out of the cockpit and took off their parachutes, the student ran to the instructor, stood at attention and asked for comments. They are so serious and conscientious. The instructor pointed out the shortcomings of the students one by one; and the students, like receiving the highest award, had a sudden enlightenment on their faces, and their eyes became brighter and more focused. Afterwards, the female instructor said to me with a smile: "Actually, two years ago, I was just a middle school student who didn't know anything."
    Interestingly, she was originally afraid of cats and dogs, and didn't dare to climb ladders. It was only the curiosity of young people and the enthusiasm for aspiring to the motherland's aviation industry that prompted her to learn gliding, but mostly with the idea of ​​trying it out. However, as the glider increased its altitude by one meter and two meters, her courage also increased with it. After a few months, she not only reached the level of a level-two glider pilot, but her appearance and demeanor also changed completely. Shyness and silence disappeared, becoming cheerful, firm, and lively, and at the same time developing a rigorous spirit of meticulousness. "You know, this is about going to heaven." When I asked why she treated the students so seriously, she said this. This sentence helped me understand her and also understand the mood of the student.
    Let's talk about Keshayin mentioned earlier. In a short period of time, he also mastered intermediate gliding skills, and is now practicing with young people such as the Mongolian girl Aliman, the Uyghur girls Lala and Yiming, and the Hui youth Jin Wanfang, preparing to participate in the first National Games in the future. In their studies, they also gradually learned Chinese. What kind of capable people they will become in the future is really hard to predict now.
    The Party nurtures our growth,
    The Motherland gave me wings.
    Open the diary of every gliding athlete, and there are almost similar lines of poetry. This is not an exaggeration at all. And the meaning of this "wing" has long gone beyond the concept of an aircraft wing; it contains talent, perseverance, and confidence in life.
    "How happy the youth of our era are!" When I was about to leave them, this sentence lingered in my heart for a long time.

### “祖国给了我翅膀”

　　“祖国给了我翅膀”
　　胡惠玲
    飞上天去，在一望无涯的碧空里翱翔，每个人在幼小的时候，几乎都有过这样的幻想。可是这是多么难于实现的啊！
    在祖国西北边境哈萨克民族聚居的地方，就流传着这样一句谚语：“福气再好、本领再强，也飞不上天。”解放后，这里的牧民虽然脱下了一年四季都披在身上的羊皮，穿上了棉布衣裳；虽然结束了无家可归的飘流生活，搬进了瓦房；这里也成立了银行、供销社和人民公社；可是，这句谚语仍一直流传着。
    他们甚至根本没有见过飞机，只是在解放后才有的课本上，看到过飞机的模样。
    但是谁能想到呢，就在这个地方，一个年轻的小伙子克沙因，却被保送去学滑翔了。滑翔是飞行的开端，驾着滑翔机同样可以在天空翱翔。克沙因简直以为自己是世界上最最幸福的人了。可是，当他脚不沾地般跑到乌鲁木齐市航空俱乐部报到时，嗬，竟还有这么多人，穿着各色各样的民族服装，说着各不相同的民族语言，而且还有甩着长发辫的姑娘！
    克沙因和同伴们激动得几夜睡不着觉，最后大家决定写封信给报社，感谢毛主席和共产党事事不忘少数民族。这封信写了，克沙因还感到满腔热情没说完，自己又写了一封。从此他的家乡也出现了一个新的谚语：“不靠福气，只凭本领，跟随我党，定上天庭。”
    其实，又何止克沙因和他的家乡的人如此激动呢！对于全国人民说来，这也是件新鲜事。滑翔是一项新起的体育运动，是在解放以后逐步发展起来的。乘着滑翔机，人们可以在天空自由自在地遨游。这对于一心想上天去的年青人，是多大的喜悦和幸福啊！
    如今，每当天气晴朗，东方透出一点红的时候，在祖国各地航空俱乐部的机场上空，就有滑翔机在飞翔着。亮红色的、橘黄色的、橙色的、米色的，各式各样的滑翔机，轻盈无声地遨游在碧蓝的天空。不是亲眼看见，真是令人很难相信，坐在上面操纵着这些神鸟的人，大都还不满二十岁。
    这是一架米黄色的双座滑翔机，在它的尾翼上画着一只腾空展翅的仙鹤。它升上高空后，仙鹤看不见了，但在我们面前却出现了比仙鹤还美丽多姿的形象。在朝阳的缕缕霞光之中，滑翔机正稳稳地轻巧地飞着。忽然它昂首向上，急速地向后仰去，来了个大翻身，再向上连续折了几个跟斗。正当大家赞叹不已的时候，它又冲向太阳直栽下来，好像是断了线的风筝，又像是一片秋叶；大家一口气还未缓过来，它却又迎风飘然而上了，那样悠然自得，令人神往，终于它像蜻蜓点水般的着陆了。座舱盖打开，露出两张红红的笑脸，简直像孩子似的。这是一男一女，男的是学员，女的是教员，年龄不相上下，教员却比学员要矮一头。一出座舱，卸下伞包，学员就跑步到教员面前，立正请求讲评。他们那样严肃认真。教员一一指出学员的缺点；而学员呢，却像得到了最高的奖励似的，面部豁然开朗，眼神也更亮更集中了。事后，女教员笑着对我说：“其实，两年前，我也是个啥事不懂的中学生。”
    说来有趣，她本来猫狗都怕，梯子也不敢上，只是青年人的好奇心和向往祖国航空事业的热情，促使她来学滑翔，但多半还带着尝试的念头。可是，随着滑翔机一公尺、两公尺地向上增加高度，她的胆量也就随着提高了。几个月后，她不仅达到了二级滑翔员的水平，她的外貌和风度也全变了。羞怯和沉默没有了，明朗、坚定、活泼起来，同时也养成了一丝不苟的严格精神。“要知道，这是上天的事”。当我询问为何那样严肃对待学员时，她这样说。这句话帮助我理解了她，也理解了那位学员的心情。
    再说前面提到过的克沙因吧，在短短的时间内，他也掌握了中级滑翔技术，如今正和蒙族姑娘爱丽曼，维吾尔族的拉拉和伊明，回族的金万方等青年编在一起练习，准备将来参加首届全国运动大会。在学习中，他们还逐步学会了汉语。将来，他们会变成什么样的能人，现在真很难料定呢。
    党哺育我们成长，
    祖国给了我翅膀。
    打开每个滑翔运动员的日记本，差不多都有着类似这样的诗句。这是一点也不夸张的。而且这“翅膀”的涵义，早已超出了机翼的概念范围，它包含着才能、毅力和对生活的信心。
    “我们这一时代的青少年，是多幸福！”临离开他们时，这句话又在我心间久久盘旋。
