Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, 24th. Widespread welcome rain has fallen on the Yunnan Plateau. In the vast areas of the Wumeng Mountains, the rainfall in mid-May increased six to ten times compared to the same period last year. The Hengduan Mountains, spanning thousands of miles of the national border, have also been shrouded in continuous rain. Mountain gullies that had been dry for more than half a year are gurgling again, and the blue Nujiang and Lancang rivers have turned into golden torrents.

The Yunnan Plateau is located in the southwestern border region. Every year, except for the rainy season from May to October, the rest of the time is controlled by the dry and warm air from the Arabian Desert and northern India, resulting in mostly sunny skies with few clouds and little rainfall. According to historical patterns, the abundance of harvest in Yunnan is related to the earliness or lateness of the rainy season. This year, the rain came early and plentifully, with relatively even rainfall each month, providing favorable conditions for increased crop production throughout the province.

After the arrival of the rainy season, the Yunnan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party seized the crucial moment and mobilized the masses to take various measures to intercept and store rainwater for irrigating farmland. Millions of farmers across the province are now planting rice, potatoes, and other summer crops in the rain.

    云南高原普降喜雨
    新华社昆明24日电  云南高原普降喜雨。乌蒙山脉广大地区在5月中旬的降雨量比去年同期增加了六至十倍。横亘数千里国境线上的横断山脉地区也已阴雨绵绵。干涸半年多的山沟又哗哗发响，蓝色的怒江和澜沧江变为金色的巨流。
    云南高原地处西南边疆。每年除5月到10月有雨外，其余的时间里，被来自阿拉伯沙漠地带和印度北部的干暖空气控制，都是晴天少云，降雨很少。根据历年的规律，云南丰收与否，与雨季来得早迟有一定关系。今年雨水来得早，雨水多，各月雨量也较均匀，为全省农作物增产提供了良好的条件。
    进入雨季之后，中共云南省委就抓住节令关键，动员群众采取各种措施拦蓄雨水，灌溉农田。现在全省数百万农民正在冒雨栽插稻谷、薯类等夏季作物。
