　　About "Encore!"
　　Hua Ren
　　Once, I went to a concert. The program was wonderful, with folk song performances, instrumental music, etc. It was hard to say which program wasn't delightful. After each performance, the audience responded with enthusiastic applause. This applause expressed the audience's love, gratitude, and encouragement for the performers. In addition to applause, the audience also shouted requests like "Sing it again!" and "Encore!" The performers bowed repeatedly, but the applause grew even more enthusiastic and refused to stop. Unable to resist the enthusiastic requests, the performers had to sing another song, or even more, until the audience was satisfied. The concert started at 7 pm and was originally scheduled to end at 9:30 pm, but it extended to after 10 pm. Almost every performer had to face the "Encore!" hurdle. Because the performances were indeed excellent, I was initially moved by the desire to hear them a few more times and joined others in applauding and requesting an encore. Later, I saw from the performers' expressions after bowing that, in addition to gratitude for the audience's enthusiasm, they also showed "unspeakable suffering." This made me feel that the audience should cherish the performers, care about their health, and be considerate of their difficulties.

　　Each performance requires the performers to undergo strenuous preparation work such as rehearsals. They prepare during the day and perform at night, which is already tiring enough. Adding the burden of "Encore!" results in exhaustion, affecting their rest and study.

　　Applause is appropriate for a good performance. The request for an "Encore!" is also reasonable. Artists certainly take pride in receiving an enthusiastic response from the masses. In the future, these expressions should still be given for good performances, but the demand for "Encore!" should be appropriate and restrained. The audience should respect and encourage the performers, but also cherish and care for them.

    关于“再来一个！”
    华仁
    有一次，我去听音乐会，节目很精彩，有民歌演唱、乐曲演奏等等，很难说那一个节目不逗人喜爱。每个节目演出之后，听众们都报以热烈的掌声。这掌声表现了听众对演员的热爱、感谢和鼓励。除了鼓掌，听众还发出“再唱一遍”“再来一个”的要求。演员一次又一次地谢幕，掌声却一阵比一阵热烈、不肯罢休。盛情难却，最后演员只好再唱一个甚至唱一个不算，还得再追加一个、两个……，直到听众满足的时候为止。这个音乐会晚七时开始，原定九时半结束，却延长到了十时以后，几乎每个演员都要过“再来一个”的关。因为的确演唱得好，最初我也被想多听几遍的愿望冲动着，跟着别人一齐鼓掌要求再来一个，后来我从演员谢幕的表情上看出演员除了感谢听众的盛意之外，确实也带有“难言之苦”。这使我感到，听众应该爱护演员，关心他们的健康，体谅他们的困难。
    演员每次演出，事先要有排练等繁重的准备工作，白天准备，晚上演出，这已经够累的了，加上“再来一个”的负担，结果疲倦不堪，影响了休息和学习。
    节目演得好，鼓掌是应该的。“再来一个”的要求也是合理的。艺术家们当然是以得到群众的热烈的反应为荣的，今后还是应该对好演出有这些表示，但是“再来一个”的要求要适当，要有节制。观众对演员，一方面应当尊重、鼓励；一方面也要爱护、关心。
