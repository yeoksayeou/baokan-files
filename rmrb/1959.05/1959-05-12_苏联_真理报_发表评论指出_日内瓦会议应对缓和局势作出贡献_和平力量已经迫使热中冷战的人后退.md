Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 11th. The Soviet newspaper "Pravda" published an editorial today entitled "Negotiations Have Begun," commenting on the Geneva East-West Foreign Ministers Conference.

The article stated that the fact that the East-West Foreign Ministers Conference is being held indicates that there has been significant progress in the development of international relations in recent times. This fact means that the forces of peace have forced those keen on the "Cold War" to retreat, and the method of jointly seeking solutions to international problems has prevailed in Western countries. It should be hoped that this assessment of the situation will not be replaced by disappointment. The article said that the Soviet people hope for peace and friendship with the people of other countries. The Soviet people hope that the Geneva Foreign Ministers Conference will make every effort to create favorable conditions for the upcoming summit of heads of government, and that the heads of government will be able to pass resolutions that will ensure a tremendous shift in the international situation in the direction of eliminating the danger of a new war.

The article said that the mission of this Geneva conference is to discuss the most important and urgent issues of the current situation in Europe: the conclusion of a German peace treaty and the elimination of the occupation regime in West Berlin. If the conference can reach a consensus on these two major issues in Europe, it will be a significant contribution to easing international tensions. The article said that the Soviet side sincerely hopes to do everything possible to reach a consensus on the need to conclude a peace treaty with the two Germanys and the need to turn West Berlin into a free city. However, for the joint work to be successful, it is not enough for only one party to have such a desire. In the period before the Geneva conference, the words and deeds of some Western figures could not be regarded as holding the desire to promote this meeting.

The article continued that the delegations of the two Germanys currently exist and participated in the Geneva Foreign Ministers Conference. The German Democratic Republic has sent representatives who will reflect the unanimous will of the residents of the German Democratic Republic, demanding to ensure the peaceful development of the German people and demanding that no more attempts be made to revive aggressive forces and revenge-seeking forces within Germany.

The article said that all the necessary conditions are now in place to prevent a new war and ensure lasting peace in the world. Never before have such broad social forces been mobilized, demanding that governments implement a policy of peaceful coexistence and international cooperation—the only viable policy in the mid-twentieth century world. If the Geneva Conference can live up to the hopes placed in it by the people of all countries, it will be successful.

    苏联“真理报”发表评论指出
    日内瓦会议应对缓和局势作出贡献
    和平力量已经迫使热中冷战的人后退
    新华社莫斯科11日电　苏联“真理报”今天以“谈判开始了”为题发表一篇编辑部文章，评论日内瓦东西方外长会议。
    文章说，东西方外长会议召开这一事实表明，最近时期在国际关系的发展中有了重大进展。这个事实意味着和平力量已经迫使热衷于“冷战”的人后退，共同谋求解决国际问题的方法在西方国家中已经占了上风。应当希望对局势的这种评价将不会被失望所代替。文章说，苏联人民希望和平，希望同其他国家人民友好。苏联人民希望，日内瓦外长会议将尽一切努力，给在不久的将来召开的政府首脑会议创造有利条件，而政府首脑将能够通过决议，保证使国际局势朝着消除新战争危险的方向产生巨大的转变。
    文章说，这次日内瓦会议的使命是讨论欧洲当前局势的最重要最迫切的问题：缔结对德和约和消除西柏林的占领制度。如果会议能够在欧洲这两个主要的问题上取得一致同意的解决办法，那将是对缓和国际紧张局势的重大贡献。文章说，苏联方面是极其认真地希望尽一切可能，使得在必须同两个德国缔结和约、必须变西柏林为自由城市这方面取得一致意见的。但是，要使共同的工作获得成功，单靠一方具有这样的愿望是不够的。在日内瓦会议召开以前的一段时期中，某些西方人士的言行决不能被认为是抱着促进这次会谈的愿望的。
    文章接着说，目前存在的两个德国的代表团参加了这次日内瓦外长会议。德意志民主共和国已派来了代表，他们将反映德意志民主共和国居民的一致的意志，要求保证德国人民的和平发展，要求不再企图在德国境内复活侵略势力和复仇势力。
    文章说，现在具备着一切必要的条件来杜绝新战争和保证世界的持久和平。从来还没有这样广大的社会力量行动起来，要求各国政府执行和平共处和国际合作的政策——在二十世纪中叶世界上唯一可行的政策。日内瓦会议如果能够不辜负各国人民对它所寄予的希望，它将获得成功。
