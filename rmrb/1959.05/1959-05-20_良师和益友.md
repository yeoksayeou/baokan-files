　　Good Teachers and Helpful Friends
　　By our correspondent Yu Huiyin
　　In early May, at a gathering of the Physics Department of Peking University, students recited a long poem they had written entitled "A Brand New Era, A Brand New Teacher-Student Relationship," praising one of their beloved professors - Huang Kun, Director of the Semiconductor Teaching and Research Office. The poem read:

　　When we mention the endearing name of Professor Huang Kun
　　All of us semiconductor specialization students
　　Hold him in deep respect
　　This respect doesn't come from his professorial authority
　　But from his diligent work
　　From his comprehensive care for the students
　　Our Professor Huang Kun
　　Is not only our good teacher
　　But also our helpful friend and comrade
　　In order to be a good socialist gardener
　　The Party's words are always in his heart
　　At work
　　He puts forth the greatest effort
　　And uses all his skills...

　　In the vigorous educational revolution, whenever the Party organization issued a call, Huang Kun always enthusiastically supported and responded, doing things in the direction pointed out by the Party. Last year, when the first factory of the entire university – the Semiconductor Factory – was established, Huang Kun discussed the factory’s construction with the students and worked with them on the construction site digging and carrying earth. After the factory was established, it began trial-producing various semiconductor devices and, in conjunction with production, launched a mass upsurge in scientific research. At this time, Huang Kun not only helped the students scientifically analyze various experimental results from a theoretical point of view, but also enthusiastically participated in production labor in the factory with the students in the posture of an ordinary worker.

　　Huang Kun has always been studying semiconductor theory. When encountering some unfamiliar technical problems in production labor and scientific research, he studied and explored them with the students, constantly enriching his practical knowledge and applying it to teaching. For example, when he lectured on the principle of the meridional diffusion of non-equilibrium carriers, the students were not deeply impressed, so he related it to the students’ experience in producing diodes in the factory, and everyone quickly understood. In this way, by combining the practical knowledge that students had already gained in production practice with the indirect knowledge from books, students understood the reasons why production was done in this way, thereby deepening their understanding of book knowledge.

　　Huang Kun has always been serious and systematic in his lectures, which were welcomed by the students, but he was not satisfied with this. This semester, the "Semiconductor Physics" course he taught used lecture notes he had written himself, and the reference book was also co-edited by himself and a comrade, and had been taught many times. However, he still devoted a lot of energy to carefully studying the teaching content, often preparing lessons late into the night, carefully studying where students might have questions after listening, and which aspects of the textbook were not clear enough and needed to be further elaborated and explained, and how to better teach his knowledge to the students in a simple and profound way.

　　During the concentrated study time of this course, as long as there were no urgent tasks and meetings, he always went to the students with several young tutors to understand the situation and provide guidance throughout the entire self-study process of student review, doing exercises, and discussion.

　　The students' long poem recorded a scene of Huang Kun tutoring student Liu Shihua. When Huang Kun lectured on the chapter "Migration Phenomenon of Electrons in Electromagnetic Fields" to tutor students in reviewing, he thought that Liu Shihua had transferred from a engineering university and had a weak theoretical foundation, and would have a hard time reviewing, so he took the initiative to see him. Liu Shihua raised some questions he did not understand, and Huang Kun not only lectured him, but also gave him demonstration calculations in his exercise book, and encouraged Liu Shihua to think for himself. Liu Shihua was deeply moved. He then raised a basic concept in semiconductor physics that he did not understand very well: "Intrinsic Excitation." Although this concept had already been lectured on and answered in the summary class, Huang Kun patiently gave Liu Shihua repeated explanations and encouraged him, saying: Basic concepts are very important, you can ask whatever you don't understand. Once, twice... all are okay, until you completely understand it.

　　Sometimes, when the wind was strong at night and Mr. Huang Kun was busy with work, the students guessed that he would not come to tutor them. But he still braved the wind to come. Sometimes, when tutoring until 10:30 in the evening, the lights-out time in the student dormitory arrived, and some difficult problems could not be explained clearly one by one, Huang Kun stood in the corridor and continued to finish the lecture before leaving.

　　Huang Kun strictly demanded himself and also strictly demanded the students. He not only paid attention to their academic progress, but also cared about their ideological progress, and cooperated with the Party and League organizations to do some ideological work. Recently, he also held a discussion with the student League group on conscious revolution and the issue of being both Red and expert.

　　Huang Kun deeply felt that teaching and learning are two contradictory aspects. It is not enough to just have the desire to teach well. He must go to the students, care about them, and understand them in order to prevent his own subjective and one-sided problems and teach according to the actual situation of the students and improve the teaching effect. Students taking the "Semiconductor Physics" course once asked Huang Kun to set thinking questions and summarize after each chapter. Huang Kun had subjectively thought that this course was not too theoretical and there was no need to set thinking questions, and that summarizing was just repeating what had been said and was not necessary. Later, he went to the students and saw that the students often did not know where to go deeper when discussing theoretical problems, and only then did he realize that setting thinking questions could solve this problem. After he understood the specific difficulties and problems in the students' learning, he felt that summarizing was indeed necessary and had content. He did these two things and achieved good teaching results. Now, Huang Kun's "Semiconductor Physics" course has ended, and the students are full of confidence in achieving good results in the exam.

    良师和益友
    本报记者　余辉音
    5月上旬，在北京大学物理系一次集会上，学生们朗诵了他们写的一首题为“崭新的时代，崭新的师生关系”的长诗，赞扬他们所热爱的一位教授——半导体教研室主任黄昆。那诗中写道：
    提起黄昆老师这亲切的名
  字
    我们半导体专门化学生的
  心中无不深深的尊敬
    这尊敬不是来自他那教授
  的威信
    而是来自他的工作辛勤
    来自他对同学们的全面关
  心
    我们的黄昆老师
    不但是我们的良师
    而且是我们的益友和同志
    为了当好社会主义的园丁
    党的话儿时刻记在他内心
    在工作中
    拿出了最大的干劲
    拿出了所有的本领…………
    在轰轰烈烈的教育革命中，每当党组织发出号召，黄昆总是热烈的支持和响应，照党指出的方向做。去年，当全校第一个工厂——半导体工厂成立时，黄昆和学生们一起讨论建厂的工作，一起在工地上挖土、挑土。工厂办起来以后，开始试制各种半导体器件，并且结合生产开始了群众性的科学研究大跃进，这时黄昆不仅从理论上帮助学生们科学地分析各种实验成果，同时，他还以一个普通劳动者的姿态，热情地和学生们一起参加工厂里的生产劳动。
    黄昆一直是研究半导体理论的。在生产劳动和科学研究中遇到一些生疏的技术问题，他就和学生在一起钻研摸索，不断丰富自己的实际知识，并且运用到教学中去。例如，他讲到非平衡载流子的经向扩散的道理时，学生听了印象不深，这时他就联系学生们在工厂生产二极管时的经历讲解，大家很快地理解了。这样，把学生在生产实践中已经获得的实际知识和书本上的间接知识结合起来，学生就知道生产上为什么要这样做的道理，从而也就加深了对书本知识的理解。
    黄昆一向讲课认真，讲得系统明确，受到学生的欢迎，但他并没有因此感到满足。这学期他所担任的“半导体物理”课，讲义原是自己写的，参考书也是自己和一个同志合编的，已经讲过好多次了。但是，他还是用了很大的精力认真钻研教学内容，经常备课到深夜，仔细研究学生听后可能会在哪些地方有疑问，哪些方面教材上讲得还不够清楚，需要进一步加以阐述和解释，在讲授中怎样深入浅出地把自己的知识更好地教给学生。
    在这门课程的集中学习时间内，只要没有紧急的工作和会议，他总是和几个年青的辅导教师一起到学生中去，在学生复习、做习题、讨论等整个自学过程中了解情况，进行指导。
    学生们的长诗记叙了黄昆辅导学生刘士华的一个场面。黄昆讲过“电子在电磁场中的迁移现象”一章来辅导学生复习时，他想到刘士华是由工科大学转来的，理论基础较差，复习时会很吃力，就主动来看他。刘士华把没有弄懂的一些问题提出来，黄昆一面给他讲课，一面在他的习题本上给他作示范性的演算，并启发刘士华自己进行思考。刘士华深受感动，他又提出半导体物理学中还不大懂的一个基本概念“本征激发”。虽然这个概念已经讲过，总结课上也作过解答，黄昆还是耐心地给刘士华作了反复的解释，并且鼓励他说：基本概念很重要，你有什么不懂的，尽管提出来问。一遍两遍……都可以，一直到完全弄懂为止。
    有时，晚上刮大风了，黄昆先生工作又忙，学生们猜想他不会来辅导他们学习了。但他还是冒着大风赶来了。有时，辅导到晚上十点半钟，学生宿舍的熄灯时间到了，而有些疑难问题还来不及一一解释清楚，黄昆就站在走廊里继续讲完才走。
    黄昆严格地要求自己，也同样严格地要求学生。他不仅注意他们的学习进步，还关怀着他们的思想进步，配合党、团组织作一些思想工作。最近他还和学生的团小组一起座谈了自觉革命和红专问题。
    黄昆深深感到教和学是矛盾的两个方面，教仅仅有教好的愿望还不够，还必须到学生中去，关心他们，了解他们，才能防止自己主观、片面的毛病，作到根据学生实际情况进行教学，提高教学效果。上“半导体物理”课的学生，曾经要求黄昆出思考题，并在讲完每一章时小结一次，黄昆曾主观地认为这门课理论性还不是太强，不必出思考题，总结不过是重复已讲过的内容，也没有必要。后来他到学生中去，看见学生在讨论理论问题时往往不知往哪儿深入，才了解到出思考题，可以解决这个问题。当他了解到学生学习中的具体困难和问题后，感到总结确实有必要，也有内容了。他作了这两项工作，都收到很好的教学效果。现在，黄昆讲授的“半导体物理”课已经结业了，学生们都满有信心在考试中取得较好的成绩。（附图片）
