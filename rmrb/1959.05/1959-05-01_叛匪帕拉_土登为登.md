    Traitor Phala Thubten Woyden

    Phala was a large serf owner in Tibet, possessing numerous feudal manors and substantial commercial capital. Due to the appreciation of the loyal lackey of British imperialism, Regent Taktra, he was promoted to Khenchung and became Taktra's trusted henchman. After liberation, he served as the Da Zhuoni (the Dalai Lama's adjutant).

    Phala is a loyal lackey of imperialism and one of the masterminds behind the Tibetan rebellion. His family had close ties with imperialism in the past. In 1950, when the Dalai Lama was coerced by reactionary elements such as Regent Taktra to flee to Yatung, he actively advocated for the Dalai Lama to go abroad. In 1952, when the reactionary "People's Conference" openly appeared, Phala plotted behind the scenes and became the central figure in the incident. In January 1954, when the Dalai Lama received the "Bhikshu precepts," Phala insisted on arranging an independent state's ceremony to accept gifts from the central government representatives. In 1956, when the Dalai Lama went to India, he and other reactionary Tibetan upper-class figures in India, such as Shakabpa and Gyalo Thondup, held multiple meetings to discuss the issue of "Tibetan independence." In 1957, he instigated the "Four Rivers and Six Ranges" movement, secretly contacting some reactionary Tusi and headmen from Sichuan, Gansu, and Qinghai who came to Lhasa to worship Buddha, and colluding with the reactionary upper class in Tibet to organize the "Tibetan People's Great Alliance" to carry out reactionary activities to split the motherland. In May and June 1958, he supported Enzhucang in leaving Lhasa to organize an armed rebellion in Shannan, establishing the "Political and Religious Defense Army."

    叛匪帕拉·土登为登
    帕拉是西藏的大农奴主，封建庄园极多，商业资本也很雄厚，由于英帝国主义的忠实走狗大札摄政的赏识，而升为堪穷，是大札的亲信爪牙。解放后任大卓尼（达赖的副官长）。
    帕拉是帝国主义的忠实走狗，是这次西藏叛乱的主谋人之一。他的家庭过去与帝国主义就有密切关系。1950年达赖喇嘛被大札摄政等反动分子胁迫逃亡亚东时，他积极主张达赖喇嘛出国。1952年反动的“人民会议”公开出现时，帕拉在幕后策划，成为该事件的中心人物。1954年1月达赖受“比丘戒”时，帕拉硬要安排一个独立国家的受礼仪式来接受中央代表的赠礼。1956年达赖喇嘛去印度时，他和在印度的西藏上层反动分子夏格巴、嘉乐顿珠等人多次召开会议，讨论“西藏独立”问题。1957年策动组织“四水六岗”运动，暗中联络川、甘、青等地来拉萨朝佛的一部分反动的土司、头人等和西藏反动上层勾结起来，组织“藏民大同盟”，进行分裂祖国的反动活动。1958年5、6月间，他支持恩珠仓离开拉萨去山南组织武装叛乱，成立“政教保卫军”。
