Comrade Dao Youliang, member of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, spoke about the great achievements of the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture in the past year and wished the Tibetan people would soon embark on the bright road of socialism together with all ethnic groups.

Chairman, fellow members:
    I fully support the work reports of Premier Zhou, Vice Premier Li Fuchun, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and Vice Chairman Li Weihan of the CPPCC.

    Comprehensive Leap Forward in Economic and Cultural Undertakings; Decisive Victory in the Socialist Transformation of Ownership

    Now, I will make a speech on the great changes and achievements of the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture in the past year:
    Located on the southwestern border of the motherland, the Xishuangbanna Dai Autonomous Prefecture, like all parts of the country, has achieved a comprehensive leap forward in industrial and agricultural production and various tasks under the brilliant guidance of the Party's general line for socialist construction. In the past year, water conservancy construction increased the irrigated area by more than 320,000 mu, exceeding the total of the past few years since liberation. Grain output increased by 38.2 percent compared to 1957, and cotton increased by three and a half times. Sugar cane production increased by 10.3 times. Tea production exceeded 15 times that of 1950, and high-quality broken red tea was successfully trial-produced. The production of shellac, an economic crop, is also very large. More than 6 million coffee plants were planted. Other economic crops, as well as fisheries, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and forestry, have also seen significant development.

    Our prefecture's industry, which started from scratch, has developed at an unprecedented speed. In the short few months of last year, 875 factories and mines of various types were built, which is more than 48 times the 18 factories and mines in 1957. For the first time, people of all ethnic groups smelted steel, iron, copper, and sulfur, mined coal, and not only produced more than 200 kinds of new agricultural implements and other tools, but also produced machine tools, planers, boring machines, electric motors, blowers, tea rolling machines, and other mechanical equipment. The industrial output value jumped from several million yuan to more than 47 million yuan. With the rapid development of industrial and agricultural production, our prefecture's commerce and trade, transportation, culture and education, science and technology, and other undertakings have also achieved great success. Now every county is connected by highway. More than 90 percent of the townships have telephones. The number of students enrolled has increased by 45 percent compared to 1957.

    While achieving great victories on the economic and cultural fronts, we have also achieved a decisive victory in the socialist transformation of ownership. Driven by the high tide of production, advanced cooperativization was realized in the land reform areas in just a few months, and 23 people's communes were established. The direct transition areas have also basically achieved primary cooperativization. Therefore, the people of all ethnic groups in the prefecture have not only abolished the shackles of feudal slavery, but also fundamentally eliminated the roots of the exploitation system. In the struggle against nature and the struggle of social revolution, the spiritual outlook of the people has also undergone great changes. The socialist consciousness of the broad masses of people and ethnic minority cadres has been greatly improved on the basis of rectification, anti-rightist struggle, and opposition to local nationalism, demonstrating a communist style of daring to think and act, mutual cooperation, and common progress. The level of production technology has been greatly improved. Backward conventions and bad habits, especially those backward factors that seriously hinder production, have been greatly changed, and learning from the advanced and catching up with the advanced has gradually become the prevailing atmosphere. At present, the people of all ethnic groups in the prefecture are exerting soaring enthusiasm, taking the heroic steps of a completely liberated nation, and advancing in high spirits together with the people of the whole country towards a happy and fulfilling tomorrow. We are full of firm belief that we will certainly be able to eliminate poverty and backwardness in a short period of time, catch up with the advanced level of the Han nationality, and make our nation among the ranks of advanced nations.

    The fundamental reason for achieving great achievements is the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, and the great victory of the Party's ethnic policy

    Why are we able to achieve such rapid development and great achievements? Without a doubt, the most fundamental reason should be attributed to the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, and to the great victory of the Party's ethnic policy. The Communist Party not only continuously supports and assists the minority nationalities politically and economically, but also points out the correct direction and guides us onto the bright socialist road. The people of all ethnic groups in Xishuangbanna deeply realize that without the leadership of the Party, there would be no present for the minority nationalities, so they regard the Party as their savior and the true representative of their national interests, and regard anyone who opposes the leadership of the Party as their mortal enemy, which is by no means accidental. Minority nationalities should protect the Party's leadership over all minority nationalities like protecting their own eyes, which is extremely important at all times. At the same time, the people of all ethnic groups in Xishuangbanna deeply realize that the unity and solidarity of the great family of the motherland is the fundamental guarantee for the development and progress of the minority nationalities. Premier Zhou said in the "Government Work Report": "The patriotic people of all ethnic groups have realized from the lessons of historical facts that only in the unified family of the motherland, after completely getting rid of imperialist oppression and embarking on the socialist road, can all ethnic groups prosper." This is an irrefutable truth. The facts in Xishuangbanna prove that our nation can develop so rapidly is inseparable from adhering to the unity of the motherland and adhering to national unity and mutual assistance. As a minority nationality, if it leaves the socialist family of the motherland and leaves the unity between ethnic groups, it will inevitably be sold by the Chiang Kai-shek gang and other reactionaries to imperialism,沦为 their colonies, and fall into the tragic situation of national滅亡, and there is no other future. The people of all ethnic groups in Xishuangbanna have drawn correct conclusions based on their own experiences by comparing the historical facts before and after liberation, and regard safeguarding the unity of the motherland and protecting the great family of the motherland as their most sacred and glorious task. They believe that safeguarding the unity of the motherland is safeguarding the interests of their own nation. They regard safeguarding national interests as an inseparable part of safeguarding the unity of the motherland. Therefore, under the leadership of the Party, our people of all ethnic groups, together with the border defense troops of the People's Liberation Army, thoroughly smashed all the conspiracies of imperialism, the remnants of the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and foreign reactionaries in the early days of liberation, and resolutely suppressed the destructive activities of counter-revolutionaries within the territory. Thus, the border defense of the motherland was consolidated, national unity was strengthened, and the common interests of progress and development of the people of all ethnic groups in the prefecture were fundamentally guaranteed.

    No matter what nation, it must go through the fundamental reform of the social system in order to embark on the road of socialism and achieve development and prosperity. The rebellion of the reactionary group in the upper echelons of Tibet has been crushed, and the day when the Tibetan people thoroughly liberate themselves has arrived.

    Recently, the original Tibetan local government and the reactionary group in the upper echelons, colluding with imperialists and Indian expansionists, launched an armed rebellion to sabotage the unity of the motherland and betray the motherland, which not only fundamentally violated the interests of the Tibetan people, but also fundamentally violated the common interests of the people of all ethnic groups in the country. The sinful behavior of the Tibetan reactionary group in selling out national interests and splitting the unity of the motherland only conforms to the wishes and interests of imperialism and foreign reactionaries. What they are implementing is the will of Indian expansionist elements, which is intolerable to the people of the whole country. Now, their armed rebellion has been completely defeated by the heroic People's Liberation Army and the Tibetan people, with the support of the people of the whole country. This is a victory for the Tibetan people and a great victory for the people of all ethnic groups in our country! We believe that the newly reborn Tibetan people will surely unite more closely in the great family of the motherland, quickly carry out social reforms, and send the serf system of the human hell and the Tibetan reactionary group into the grave together. Together with all fraternal ethnic groups in the country, they will embark on the bright and happy socialist road! However, the Indian expansionist elements, who have suffered a shameful defeat, are not reconciled to failure. Like wild cats that have been hurt by trying to steal chickens, they are frantically clamoring there. Indian diplomatic officials are also distributing the so-called "statement of the Dalai Lama." Some of their political activists, newspapers, and radio stations are also starting up reactionary machines there, openly slandering our country, unreasonably interfering in our internal affairs, and insulting the great leaders of the people of all ethnic groups in our country. The reactionary behavior of Indian expansionist elements has seriously undermined the "Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence" and violated the attitude that a friendly neighbor should have. Is this tolerable, what is not tolerable? We want to warn the Indian expansionists that the Chinese people today are not to be trifled with! We have stood up united like steel, and anyone who妄想 to拔一根毫毛 from our country will be 血流滿面!

    The rapid development of the people of all ethnic groups in Xishuangbanna has once again shown us a truth, that is, no matter what nation, it must go through the fundamental reform of the social system in order to embark on the road of socialism and be able to develop and prosper. Not long ago, our Dai and other fraternal ethnic groups in Xishuangbanna, like today's Tibet, were still suffering from the cruel exploitation of the feudal lord system, and the development of the nation was seriously hindered. The people lived an extremely dark and painful life. However, in the past few years since liberation, under the leadership of the Communist Party, the broad masses of working people have been resolutely relied upon and mobilized, and patriotic national public figures have been united. In 1956, according to the specific conditions of the nation, a peaceful consultation method was adopted to complete land reform, destroy the feudal lord system, and eliminate the lord and landlord classes, so that the peasants who had been enslaved and oppressed for thousands of years turned over and became the masters of the land and their own destiny, liberated the productive forces, rapidly promoted the development of the entire nation, and paved the way to socialism. Our own experience proves that socialist reform is the common path that any nation must go through. It is inconceivable that a transition to socialism can be made on the basis of a feudal social system or other backward social systems.

    西藏人民彻底翻身的日子到了
    刀有良委员
    谈西双版纳傣族自治州一年来的巨大成就，祝西藏人民不久将同各族人民一起走上社会主义的光明大道主席团、各位委员：
    我完全拥护周总理和李富春副总理、李先念副总理、彭真副委员长以及政协李维汉副主席等各位首长的各项工作报告。
    经济文化事业全面跃进；所有制的社会主义改造取得决定性胜利
    现在仅就西双版纳傣族自治州一年来的巨大变化和成就作如下发言：
    处在祖国西南边疆的西双版纳傣族自治州，和全国各地一样，在党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，工农业生产和各项工作都获得了全面跃进的发展。去年一年兴修的水利增加灌溉面积达到三十二万多亩，超过了解放几年来的总和。粮食的产量比一九五七增长百分之三十八点二，棉花增长三倍半。甘蔗增产十点三倍。茶叶产量超过了一九五○年的十五倍多，并试制成功了质量很高的碎红茶。经济作物中的紫胶产量也很大。种植了咖啡六百多万株。其他经济作物和渔、牧、副、林业也都有显著的发展。
    我州的工业，从无到有，发展的速度是空前的。在去年短促的几个月中，兴建了各种厂、矿八百七十五个，等于一九五七年十八个厂矿的四十八倍多。各族人民第一次炼出了钢、铁、铜和硫磺，挖出了煤炭，不但制出了二百多种新式农具和其他工具，还制出了车床、刨床、镗床和电动机、鼓风机、柔茶机等机械设备。工业产值由几百万元跃到四千七百多万元。随着工农业生产的飞跃发展，我州的商业贸易、交通运输、文化教育、科学技术等各方面事业都同样取得了巨大的成就。现在县县已经通了公路。百分之九十以上的乡，通了电话。在校学生比一九五七年增加了百分之四十五。
    在经济文化战线上获得了伟大胜利的同时，在所有制的社会主义改造方面，我们也获得了决定性的胜利。在生产高潮的推动下，短短的几个月中，土改地区实现了高级合作化，并且建立了二十三个人民公社。直接过渡地区也基本上实现了初级合作化。因此，全州各族人民不但废除了封建奴隶的枷锁，而且根本消除了产生剥削制度的根源。在和自然斗争与社会革命的斗争中，人们的精神面貌也发生很大的变化。广大人民群众和民族干部在整风反右和反对地方民族主义的基础上，社会主义觉悟大大提高，表现了敢想敢干、互相协作、共同进步的共产主义风格。生产技术水平有了很大的提高。落后的陈规陋习，特别是那些严重障碍生产的落后因素，都有了很大改变，学先进，赶先进逐渐形成了风气。目前全州各族人民，正在发挥着冲天干劲，以彻底解放了的民族的豪迈步伐，和全国人民一道向着幸福美满的明天，高歌猛进。我们充满着坚强的信念，我们一定能够在不长的时间内，消灭贫困落后，赶上汉族先进水平，使我们的民族跻于先进民族的行列。
    取得巨大成就的根本原因，是党和毛主席的英明领导，是党的民族政策的伟大胜利
    为什么我们能够获得这样迅速的发展和巨大的成就呢？毫无疑问，最根本的原因应该归功于党和毛主席的英明领导，归功于党的民族政策的伟大胜利。共产党不但从政治上经济上给少数民族以不断的提携和扶持，而且给我们指出了正确的方向，引导我们走上了光明的社会主义康庄大道。西双版纳各族人民深切体会到，没有党的领导就没有少数民族的今天，所以他们把党看成救命恩人和自己民族利益的真正代表者，而把任何反对党的领导的人，看成自己的死敌，这绝不是偶然的。少数民族应该像保护自己的眼睛一样，保护党对各少数民族的领导，这不论在任何时候都是极其重要的。同时西双版纳各族人民，又深切地体会到伟大祖国大家庭的统一团结是少数民族发展进步的根本保证。周总理在“政府工作报告”中说：“各族的爱国人民从历史事实的教训中认识到，只有在彻底摆脱帝国主义压迫，走上社会主义道路的祖国统一的大家庭中，各民族才能兴旺起来。”这是颠扑不破的真理。西双版纳的事实证明，我们的民族能够这样迅速的发展起来，是和坚持祖国统一，坚持民族团结互助分不开的。作为一个少数民族，如果离开了社会主义的祖国大家庭，离开了各民族之间的团结，必然要被蒋介石匪帮和其他反动派出卖给帝国主义，沦为他们的殖民地，陷入亡族灭种的悲惨境地，其他前途是没有的。西双版纳各族人民对比了解放前后的历史事实，根据自己的切身体验，得出了正确的结论，把维护祖国的统一团结，保卫祖国大家庭，作为自己最神圣的光荣任务。认为维护祖国的统一团结，就是维护自己民族的利益。把维护民族利益看成了维护祖国统一的一个不可分割的部分。因此，我们各族人民在党的领导下，和人民解放军边防部队一起，在解放初期就彻底粉碎了帝国主义、蒋介石残余匪帮和外国反动派的一切阴谋活动，坚决镇压了境内反革命分子的破坏活动。从而巩固了祖国边防，加强了民族团结，使全州各族人民进步发展的共同利益，获得根本的保障。
    不论任何民族都必须经过社会制度的根本改革，才能走上社会主义道路，才能得到发展和繁荣。西藏上层反动集团的叛乱已被粉碎，西藏人民彻底翻身的日子已经到来
    最近原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团，勾结帝国主义和印度扩张主义者，发动了破坏祖国统一、背叛祖国的武装叛乱，不但从根本上违背了西藏人民的利益，而且也根本违反了全国各族人民的共同利益。西藏反动集团这种出卖民族利益、分裂祖国统一的罪恶行为，只是符合帝国主义和外国反动派的愿望和利益，他们所执行的就是印度扩张主义分子的意旨，这是全国人民所不能容忍的。现在，他们的武装叛乱，已经被英勇的人民解放军和西藏人民，在全国人民的支援下，彻底打垮了。这是西藏人民的胜利，也是我国各族人民的伟大胜利！我们相信，获得了新生的西藏人民，一定会更加亲密地团结在祖国大家庭里，迅速进行社会改革，把人间地狱的农奴制度，和西藏反动集团一起送进坟墓去。同全国各兄弟民族一道走上光明幸福的社会主义道路！但是，已经遭到了可耻失败的印度扩张主义分子，却不甘心失败，他们像偷鸡不着被打伤的野猫一样，在那里丧心病狂地叫嚣。印度外交官员还散发所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”。他们的一些政治活动家、报纸、广播也在那里开动了反动机器，公开诬蔑我国，无理干涉我国内政，侮辱我国各族人民的伟大领袖。印度扩张主义分子的反动行为，严重地破坏了“和平共处五项原则”，违反了一个友好邻邦应有的态度。是可忍，熟不可忍？我们要警告印度扩张主义者，今天的中国人民是不好惹的！我们已经团结得像钢铁一般地站立起来了，谁要妄想在我们国家的身上拔一根毫毛，都要碰得头破血流的！
    西双版纳各族人民的迅速发展，又给我们显示了一条真理，就是不论任何民族都必须经过社会制度的根本改革，才能走上社会主义的道路，才能够得到发展和繁荣。我们西双版纳的傣族和其他各兄弟民族，在不久以前和今天的西藏一样，还经受着封建领主制度的残酷压榨，民族的发展受到了严重障碍，人民过着极为黑暗痛苦的生活。但是解放几年来，在共产党的领导下，坚决地依靠和发动了广大劳动人民，团结了爱国的民族公众领袖人物，在一九五六年，根据民族的具体条件，采取了和平协商的方式，完成了土地改革，摧毁了封建领主制度，消灭了领主、地主阶级，使几千年被奴役、被压迫的农民翻了身，作了土地和自己命运的主人，解放了生产力，迅速促进了整个民族的发展，并铺平了走向社会主义的道路。我们自己的经历证明，社会主义改革是任何民族必须经历的共同道路。不能设想，在封建社会制度或其他落后的社会制度的基础上，能够过渡到社会主义。
