    Machine-Sewn Cloth Shoes
    Xiao Guozhen, a worker at the Wuhan Department Store Wholesale Station Shoe Factory, successfully experimented with using a sewing machine to sew cloth shoes. Using a machine instead of hand-sewing increases efficiency six-fold. After many experiments, Xiao Guozhen narrowed the presser foot of a No. 44 sewing machine and slightly widened the layer connecting the sole to the upper by half a centimeter, then edge-stitched (sewed) it. The upper and sole were finally connected. In the past, manual operation allowed one person to sew ten pairs of shoes in eight hours, but now, using a machine, one person can sew sixty pairs of shoes in eight hours.

    机器翻鞘布鞋
    武汉百货批发站制鞋厂工人萧国珍试用缝纫机翻鞘布鞋获得成功。用机器代替手工鞘鞋，提高工效六倍。萧国珍经过多次试验把四十四号缝纫机压脚改窄，并将鞋底连接鞋帮的一层略为放宽半公分，进行沿边扎（缝）住。鞋帮和鞋底终于连接起来。过去手工操作，一人八小时鞘鞋十双，现在使用机器操作一人八小时可鞘鞋六十双。
