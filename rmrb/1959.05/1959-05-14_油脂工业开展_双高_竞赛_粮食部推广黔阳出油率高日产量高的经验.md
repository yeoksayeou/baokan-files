Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, May 13th: The Ministry of Food recently held an on-site conference on "Double High Output" (high oil extraction rate, high daily output per oil press) in Anjiang Town, Qianyang Special District, Hunan, which fully summarized and exchanged the advanced experiences of Qianyang Special District and other regions in "Double High Output" for oil processing. The conference demanded that all regions rapidly promote these experiences in order to launch a nationwide red flag competition movement for "Double High Output Every Month, Complete Success Every Quarter" in oil processing, to increase the production of more oil for the country.

Qianyang Special District is rich in oilseeds such as tea seeds and tung seeds, and the oil extraction rate of various oilseeds is very high. In 1958, the special district created a record of an average of 32.5 jin of oil extracted from every 100 jin of tea seeds, and 33 jin of oil extracted from tung and rapeseed respectively. The oil extraction rate per 100 jin of raw materials was universally more than 6 jin higher than in 1957. This year, oil mills in various parts of the special district have vigorously carried out technical innovation and "Double High Output" movements. Among the 2,823 oil mills in the district, 603 have created "Double High Output" records averaging around 400 jin of oil per oil press per day, with tea, tung, and rapeseed oil extraction rates generally stabilized above 35% to 40%. The daily output per unit has more than doubled compared to the past.

The main experiences of Qianyang Special District in achieving the above results are: First, putting politics in command, strengthening leadership, and comprehensive planning. Party committee secretaries in key producing counties, townships, and communes of the special district went deep into the oil mills to strengthen specific leadership of the oil pressing work, and promptly summarized and promoted advanced experiences. Second, cultivating typical examples, establishing banners, using key points to drive the whole area, and universally improving. According to incomplete statistics, a total of 169 experimental oil mills have been established in the district since last year. The special district, counties, townships, and communes held more than 270 on-site conferences on oil processing, extensively exchanging advanced experiences and promoting the continuous development of the oil production increase movement. Third, vigorously launching mass movements and making great efforts in the technological revolution. Various parts of the special district are now fully utilizing water and animal power as power sources to replace manual operation, and using bamboo and wood instead of steel to improve oil pressing tools.

During the conference, the representatives also visited the Shanmutian Oil Mill of Chatou Brigade of Xiazhou People's Commune and the Hongqi Oil Mill of Longtian Brigade in Qianyang County, carefully watched the oil workers' operating performances, and personally participated in trial pressing. After the visit and study, the representatives unanimously agreed that the universal promotion of Qianyang Special District's "Double High Output" experience would play a significant role in the country's oil production increase work.

All the representatives attending the conference also proposed a proposal to oil factories (mills) and oil workers across the country to launch a red flag competition movement for "Double High Output Every Month, Complete Success Every Quarter" in oil processing. The competition target proposed in the proposal is: to increase the oil extraction rate by 2 to 5 jin on the existing basis, and strive to double the daily output per unit. In order to successfully carry out this competition, the conference required relevant departments in various regions to focus on grasping the rapeseed processing work in the second quarter of this year, resolutely eliminate records below 32% oil extraction rate, and strive to achieve an average oil extraction rate of over 35% on a county basis.

A total of 184 cadres engaged in oil processing and workers from some oil factories (mills) from ten provinces and regions including Fujian, Guizhou, Sichuan, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, Hubei, Guangdong, Guangxi, Shaanxi, and Hunan attended the conference.

    油脂工业开展“双高”竞赛
    粮食部推广黔阳出油率高日产量高的经验
    新华社长沙13日电  粮食部最近在湖南黔阳专区安江镇召开的油脂加工“双高产”（出油率高、每台榨油机日产量高）现场会议，充分总结、交流了黔阳专区和其它地区油脂加工“双高产”的先进经验。会议要求各地迅速推广这些经验，以便在全国掀起一个油脂加工“月月双高产、季季满堂红”的红旗竞赛运动，为国家增产更多的油脂。
    黔阳专区盛产茶子、桐子等油料，各种油料的出油率很高。1958年度这个专区曾经创造了全区平均每百斤茶子出油三十二点五斤，桐子、菜子各出油三十三斤的丰产纪录。每百斤原料的出油率比1957年度普遍提高六斤多。今年，专区各地油坊又大力开展了技术革新和“双高产”运动，在全区二千八百二十三座榨坊中，有六百零三座创造了平均每台榨油机日产油四百斤左右，茶、桐、菜子出油率普遍稳定在35％到40％以上的双高产纪录。台日产量比过去增加一倍以上。
    黔阳专区取得上述成绩的主要经验是：一、政治挂帅，加强领导，全面规划。专区各主要产区的县、乡、社党委书记都深入榨坊，加强了对榨油工作的具体领导，并且及时总结和推广先进经验。二、培养典型，树立旗帜，以点带面，普及提高。据不完全统计，去年以来，全区共建立了一百六十九座试验油坊。专、县、乡、社各级召开了二百七十多次油脂加工现场会议，广泛交流先进经验，推动油脂增产运动不断地向前发展。三、大搞群众运动，大闹技术革命。专区各地现在充分利用了水力、畜力作动力代替人力操作，利用竹木代替钢铁改进榨油工具。
    在会议进行期间，代表们还参观了黔阳县硖州人民公社岔头大队杉木田油坊和龙田大队红旗油坊，仔细观看了榨工们的操作表演，并且亲自参加了试榨。代表们在参观学习之后，都一致认为普遍推广黔阳专区的“双高产”经验，对全国的油脂增产工作将起极大的作用。
    参加会议的全体代表还向全国油厂（坊）及油脂工作者提出掀起油脂加工“月月双高产、季季满堂红”红旗竞赛运动的倡议书，倡议书提出的竞赛目标是：出油率在现有基础上提高二至五斤，台日产量力争翻一番。为胜利地开展这一竞赛，会议要求各地有关主管部门在今年第二季度内要突出地抓紧菜子加工工作，坚决消灭出油率32％以下的纪录，力争以县为单位的平均出油率达到35％以上。
    参加这次会议的有福建、贵州、四川、江西、浙江、湖北、广东、广西、陕西和湖南等十省、区，从事油脂加工工作的干部和部分油厂（坊）的工人共一百八十四人。
