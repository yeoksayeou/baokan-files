    On-the-Spot Visits for Quality Education
    Changxing Refractory Material Factory Achieves National Standard for Product Qualification Rate
    (Our report) The Changxing Refractory Material Factory has recently adopted effective measures, and the quality of its products has improved rapidly. The refractoriness has increased from 1600 degrees to 1730 degrees, the compressive strength has increased from 150 kilograms per square centimeter to 300 kilograms, and the product qualification rate has increased from 70% to over 95%. The porosity has also been greatly reduced, reaching the standards stipulated by the state.
    For a period of time, the product quality of the Changxing Refractory Material Factory was not high. Some cadres and workers in the factory had a one-sided view of simply pursuing output and neglecting quality, believing that refractory bricks were in short supply, and even if the quality was poor, people would still want them. Due to this thinking, the factory once relaxed the inspection of product quality, and rarely mentioned quality issues when arranging production tasks or summarizing production. In response to these ideological problems, the factory's Party branch mobilized all employees to conduct discussions on issues such as "whether to improve quality" and "how to improve quality." At the same time, workers were organized to visit the Changxing Iron and Steel Plant and the Banshan Iron and Steel Plant to learn about blast furnace construction and production, so that workers could further understand the relationship between the quality of refractory bricks and steel production. When the workers visited the Changxing Iron and Steel Plant to build a blast furnace, they saw that the quality of the refractory bricks did not meet the specifications, and the furnace construction workers had to re-grind the refractory bricks one by one. One person could only grind dozens of bricks a day, which not only caused a waste of manpower and materials but also affected the construction speed of the blast furnace. Some workers saw that the 255-cubic-meter large blast furnace of the Banshan Iron and Steel Plant was under construction, and other materials were ready, but the refractory bricks did not meet the specifications, and work was suspended waiting for materials. These facts deeply educated cadres and workers that the quality of refractory bricks must be improved.
    In order to break through the quality barrier, the factory's employees put forward more than 40 rationalization proposals aimed at the key factors affecting quality. For example, the crushing and mixing workshop improved the mixing operation method, so that the moisture, particle size, and raw material ratio were uniform, overcoming the phenomenon of uneven dryness and wetness, or “half-cooked rice.” Workers in the blank making and forming workshop improved the blank stacking method, changing the thick stack to a thin stack, reducing the pressure on the bottom semi-finished products, and avoiding the phenomenon of brick blanks being crushed and deformed. At the same time, production management was strengthened, and a mutual inspection and acceptance system was established for each process from batching to firing; and unreasonable technical indicators were revised. At the same time, the "four no's" and "two musts" system was also stipulated. The "four no's" are: raw materials are not mixed well, no forming; unqualified brick blanks are not allowed to enter the blank drying room; deformed bricks with missing edges and corners are not allowed to enter the kiln; substandard products are not allowed to leave the factory after leaving the kiln. The "two musts" are: operations must be unified to ensure product specifications; inspections must be diligent and no defective products are allowed to pass. (Attached photo)

    实地参观接受质量教育
    长兴耐火器材厂正品率达到国家标准
    本报讯　长兴耐火器材厂近来采取有效措施，产品质量有了迅速的提高。耐火度由一千六百度提高到一千七百三十度，耐压强度从每平方一百五十公斤提高到三百公斤，正品率由过去的70％提高到95％以上，气空率也大大降低，达到了国家规定的标准。
    长兴耐火器材厂有一段时间的产品质量不高，厂里有些干部和职工存在着单纯追求产量忽视质量的片面观念，认为耐火砖是缺门货，质量差一点也有人要。由于存在这种思想，厂里一度放松了产品质量的检验工作，在布置生产任务、总结生产时，对质量问题也很少提到。厂里党支部针对这些思想问题，发动全厂职工就“要不要提高质量”、“怎样提高质量”等问题，进行鸣放辩论。同时，又组织工人到长兴钢铁厂和半山钢铁厂参观高炉建筑和生产情况，使工人进一步明确耐火砖质量的好坏与钢铁生产的关系，当工人们参观长兴钢铁厂建造高炉时，看到耐火砖质量不符合规格，建炉工人就把耐火砖一块一块重新磨削一遍，一个人一天只能磨几十块，不但造成人力物力的浪费，而且影响了高炉的建设速度。有的工人看了半山钢铁厂二百五十五立方公尺的大高炉在建造，其他物资都准备好了，就是耐火砖不合规格，停工待料。这些事实深深地教育了干部和工人一定要提高耐火砖的质量。
    为了突破质量关，这个厂职工针对影响质量的关键，提出了四十多条合理化建议。如粉碎调料车间改进了调料操作方法，使水分、粒度和原料配比均匀，克服了干湿不匀“夹生饭”的现象。制坯成型车间工人改进了堆坯法，把厚堆改为薄堆，减轻了底层半成品的压力，避免了砖坯压伤走型的现象。同时，还加强生产管理，从配料到烧成，每道工序都建立了互相检查验收的制度；并修改了不合理的技术指标。同时又规定了“四不”“二要”的制度。“四不”是：原料调得不好不成型；不合格的砖坯不进烘坯房；去边缺角的变型砖不进窑；出窑后不合标准不出厂。“二要”是：要统一操作，保证产品规格；要勤检查不允许次品过关。（附图片）
    上海泰山耐火材料厂职工努力增产高质量的耐火材料，支援上海钢铁工业的生产建设需要。
