    Basic Courses at the University of Science and Technology of China
    Qian Xuesen, Head of the Department of Mechanics and Mechanical Engineering, University of Science and Technology of China

    The University of Science and Technology of China (USTC) is dedicated to training top-notch scientific research and technical personnel for our country. Therefore, students must build a solid foundation for future research work while at the university. What constitutes the foundation for research work? Naturally, it is multifaceted. Political awareness, professional knowledge, physical fitness, and the ability to read foreign languages are all fundamental. However, we are not discussing these aspects here but rather the basic courses outside of the specialized fields. At USTC, these are divided into two categories: one is basic theory, which includes physics, chemistry, and mathematics; the other is basic technology, such as mechanical design. These basic courses occupy a very important position in the USTC teaching plan. The contact hours for basic theory vary slightly across different majors but account for about one-third of the total contact hours. The contact hours for basic technology also account for more than ten percent of the total contact hours. Therefore, the proportion of basic theory is higher at USTC than in general engineering colleges, while the proportion of basic technology is higher than in general science programs.

    We emphasize basic theory because USTC students will be engaged in research on new sciences and technologies in the future. Since it involves new sciences and technologies, conducting research means venturing into areas that have not been fully explored, walking paths that predecessors have not yet traversed. In other words, it means exploration. This exploration cannot be blind; it must fully utilize the work experience of predecessors. However, in the fields of new sciences and technologies, there will not be much work experience from predecessors. Therefore, we can only rely more on general knowledge, which is the general laws of nature obtained through thousands of years of human struggle with nature. For us, particularly important are the laws governing the structure, properties, and motion of matter; these are physics and chemistry. They serve as our compass during the exploration process, helping us judge which one or which few paths among the many seemingly viable ones are indeed passable, while the rest are not. That is, using the general laws of nature to discern which ideas are definitely correct, which ideas are possibly correct, and which ideas are definitely wrong. Naturally, when conducting research, we do not need to spend effort on paths that are already known to be wrong but should concentrate our efforts on paths that are definitely or possibly correct. For example, the general laws of motion tell us that perpetual motion machines are impossible. Therefore, any machine incorporating a perpetual motion mechanism is impossible, and we do not need to consider it. Another example is that the laws of quantum mechanics tell us that it is impossible to determine all pairs of conjugate variables with absolute precision at the same instant. The position and momentum of a particle are a pair of conjugate variables. Therefore, if a theory in the microscopic world requires knowing both the position and the velocity of a particle simultaneously, then that theory is wrong and we do not need to consider it. Another example: the energy of chemical bonds is known, especially the bonds between various carbon and hydrogen atoms. We know their energy clearly, and we also know the binding energy of carbon dioxide and water molecules. Therefore, if someone says they have invented a hydrocarbon fuel that has twice the energy of gasoline, we can also conclude that this comrade is mistaken; such high-energy hydrocarbon fuels are impossible, and we do not need to believe him.

    These examples illustrate the importance of basic theory. However, we can also see that making such principled judgments requires not only knowing the general laws of nature but also fully mastering these laws, understanding them thoroughly from every angle, front and back. Only in this way can we have keen eyes, analyze the core issues in complex matters, avoid being blinded by all kinds of false appearances, and thus distinguish truth from falsehood. Therefore, the physics and chemistry courses at USTC, in addition to teaching knowledge and paying attention to combining with various specialized fields, place more emphasis on the systematic nature of these two basic theories. They aim to give students a clear and comprehensive concept and image, and make them masters of these two disciplines. To this end, in tutorials, we also focus on cultivating students' viewpoints and methods for analyzing phenomena; and provide some training in independent thinking. Naturally, the experimental courses that complement the physics and chemistry lecture courses help consolidate the learning of these laws. Moreover, these experimental courses also enable students to learn the tools and precise, rigorous experimental techniques that are essential for future research.

    We should also mention that USTC emphasizes chemistry as a basic theory, even in non-chemical majors. We know that the research and development of new sciences and technologies are inseparable from new materials. To understand and master the properties of constantly emerging new materials, or to rationally propose requirements for new materials that do not yet exist, a relatively systematic and comprehensive knowledge of chemical theory is necessary.

    When conducting scientific research, we must study the relationships between various factors and quantities and perform calculations of quantitative relationships. Of course, calculation and analysis are not mysterious things. In the early stages of agricultural cooperation, didn't some cooperative's accountants use soybeans to keep accounts? So, even if we know nothing about advanced mathematics, using some simple methods is not impossible. The problem here is not whether it can be done but whether it is good or bad. Using simple methods, although complex calculations can be performed, takes too much time and is prone to errors. Using efficient methods can save time and reduce errors. So, what is an efficient calculation method? Naturally, it can only be obtained by fully utilizing the achievements of mathematics. Therefore, on the one hand, we do not overestimate mathematical methods. It is just a tool in our calculations; it cannot turn a theory that is inherently unreasonable into a reasonable one, nor can it turn one that is reasonable into an unreasonable one. On the other hand, we also attach great importance to mathematical methods because it is a very effective research tool.

    Therefore, at USTC, our mathematics courses are relatively comprehensive, and their content is not less than the entire mathematics course learned by mathematics majors in universities before liberation. However, our teaching methods are very different from those used by mathematics majors before liberation. Our teaching method is first and foremost materialistic. We start with the origin of every mathematical concept, explaining that it did not fall from the sky. Here, we cite examples of actual scientific problems to explain. After a concept is introduced, we conduct systematic and rigorous argumentation and development to give students a solid foundation, so that even if they encounter mathematical tools they have not learned before in the future, they can master them on their own. Naturally, while focusing on mathematical concepts, we have not forgotten that we are not learning mathematics for the sake of mathematics; we learn mathematics to perform concrete calculations. Therefore, after explaining each mathematical concept and system of argumentation, we also explain the methods of using this theory through concrete practical problems. We believe that this can combine mathematical theory with practice, allowing students to fully master the theory and flexibly use the theory to perform calculations and analyses.

    Another type of basic course at USTC is basic technology. This includes mechanical design courses such as engineering drawing, principles of mechanics, mechanics of materials, and machine component design, as well as electrical engineering and electronics courses including electrical engineering and electronics technology. The reason we attach importance to these courses is that in the research work of new sciences and technologies, it is often necessary to design relatively complex experimental devices. For example, studying high-speed aerodynamics requires supersonic wind tunnels, and studying fundamental particle physics requires high-energy accelerators. Designing these devices cannot be done by trial and error; it is necessary to carry out relatively formal technical design. Therefore, basic technical training is very necessary.

    We attach importance to basic courses, not only can be seen from the proportion of class hours occupied, but also from the list of teachers of basic courses at USTC: Among our basic course teachers are Wu Youxun, Vice President of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Academician of the Department of Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry, and physicist; Hua Luogeng, Director of the Institute of Mathematics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Academician of the Department of Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry, and mathematician; Yan Jici, Director of the Department of Technical Sciences of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Academician of the Department of Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry, and physicist; and Wang Baoren, Researcher of the Institute of Chemistry of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Academician of the Department of Mathematics, Physics and Chemistry, and chemist. Other basic course teachers are also senior researchers from various institutes of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. These teachers have all achieved academic success and have a broad knowledge base. Therefore, they have relatively mature and unique views on the disciplines. Students can get profound inspiration from frequent contact with them. Of course, these senior researchers have heavy tasks, and it is not easy to take the time to give lectures. However, rapidly training a group of young top-notch scientific cadres for the motherland is a glorious task. What does it matter to have some more white hair?

    中国科学技术大学里的基础课
    中国科学技术大学力学和力学工程系系主任  钱学森
    中国科学技术大学是为我国培养尖端科学研究技术干部的，因此学生必需在学校里打下将来作研究工作的基础。什么是作研究工作的基础呢？那自然是多方面的，政治觉悟、专业知识、体质、阅读外文的能力等，都是基础。我们在这里要谈的不是这些，而是专业以外的基础课；这在科技大学分两类：一类是基础理论，也就是物理、化学和数学；一类是基础技术如机械设计。这些基础课在科技大学教学计划中占很重要的位置，基础理论学时在各个专业里略有不同，但占总学时的三分之一左右；而技术基础的学时也占总学时的百分之十几。所以基础理论的比重在科技大学比一般工科学院要高，而基础技术的比重又比在一般理科专业要高。
    我们重视基础理论的原故，是因为科技大学的学生将来要从事于新科学、新技术的研究；既然是新科学、新技术，要研究它就是要在尚未完全开辟的领域里去走前人还没有走过的道路，也就是去摸索，摸索当然不能是盲目的，必须充分利用前人的工作经验。可是在新科学、新技术领域里，前人的工作经验不会太多，因此我们只有更多地依靠一般的知识、也就是人类几千年以来和自然界作斗争的经验，通过总结所得出来的自然界一般规律。对我们来讲，其中尤其重要的是关于物质结构、性质和运动的规律，这就是物理、化学。它们也就是我们在摸索过程中的指南针，在许多条看来可以走的道路中，帮助我们判断那一条、或那几条道路是可以走得通的，而其余是走不通的。也就是说利用自然界的一般规律去分辨出，哪一个想法肯定是对的，哪一个想法可能是对的，而哪一个想法肯定是错的。自然，我们作研究，不必在已肯定是错的路子上去花工夫，而应该集中精力于肯定是或可能是对的路子上。举个例子：运动的一般规律告诉我们说，永动机是不可能的，所以一切包含永动机构的机器是不可能的，不必去想它。再如量子力学的规律告诉我们说，一切共轭量是不可能在同一瞬间绝对精确地测定的，质点的位置和动量就是一对共轭量，因此如果在微观世界里一个理论要求同时知道质点的位置和运动速度，那么那个理论就是错的，不必去考虑它。再举个例：化学键的能量是知道了的，特别是各种碳原子和氢原子之间的键，它们的能量我们知道得清楚，我们也知道二氧化碳分子和水分子的结合能，因此如果有人说他发明了一种比汽油能量大一倍的碳氢化合物燃料，我们也可以断定这位同志搞错了，那样的高能碳氢化合物燃料是不可能的，不必去相信他。
    这些例子说明了基础理论的重要性，但我们也可以看出来要作这种原则性的判断，要求的还不是光知道自然界的一般规律，要求的是充分掌握这些规律，把规律的里里外外、前前后后都看得清清楚楚，摸得透。只有这样才能具有锐利的眼光，能在复杂的事物中分析出核心问题，不被形形色色的假象所蒙蔽，从而辨别真伪。所以科技大学里的物理、化学课除了教知识、注意和各个专业相结合，更注重这两门基础理论的系统性，要给学生一个清晰的全面概念和图象，要他们成为这两门学科的主人。为此，在辅导课里，我们也注意到养成学生分析事物现象的观点和方法；在独立思考方面，有所锻炼。自然，与物理和化学讲授课相辅的实验课，是有助于巩固规律的学习的；而且这些实验课，也使学生初步学到将来作研究所必不可少的工具、精密严紧的实验技术。
    我们也要提一下，科技大学对化学这门基础理论，即使在各个非化学专业里，也是被重视的。我们知道新科学、新技术的研究和发展是和新材料分不开的，而要对不断出现的新材料，能了解和掌握它们的性质，或是要合理地提出还不存在的新材料要求，那就要比较系统的和全面的化学理论知识。
    进行科学研究的时候，我们必需研究各个因素和各个量之间的关系，进行量的关系的计算。当然计算与分析不是什么神秘的东西，在农业合作化初期，有些社的会计不是用黄豆粒的办法来记账吗？所以就是我们一点也不知道高深的数学，用些简陋的方法也并不是不可以；这里的问题不是能不能的问题，而是好不好的问题。用简陋的方法，虽然也能进行复杂的计算，但是太花时间，容易出差错；用高效能的方法就能节省时间，少出差错。那么什么是高效能的计算方法呢？那自然是要充分利用了数学的成果才能得到的。所以我们一方面不过高地估价数学方法，它不过是我们计算中的工具，它不能把本来没有道理的理论变成有道理，也不能把本来有道理的变成没有道理；我们另一方面也十分重视数学方法，因为它是一个非常有效的研究工具。
    因此在科技大学里，我们的数学课是比较全面的，它的内容不比解放前大学数学专业所学的整个数学课少。但是我们的教法却与解放前的数学专业所用的教法大不相同，我们的教法，首先是唯物主义的，我们对每一个数学概念都从它来源讲起，说明它不是凭空掉下来的；在这里我们都引用实际科学问题的例子来解说。一个概念引入了之后，我们就进行系统的、严格的论证和发展，使学生有一个巩固的基础，即使他们在将来遇到了以前没有学过的数学工具，也能靠自己来掌握它。自然，我们在注重数学概念的同时，也没有忘了我们不是为数学而数学，我们学数学是为了作具体计算；所以在每讲了一个数学的概念和系统论证之后，我们还通过具体的实际问题来解说使用这个理论的方法。我们认为这样能把数学的理论与实践相结合起来，让学生既充分掌握理论，也能灵活地使用理论，进行计算和分析。
    在科技大学里的另一类基础课是基础技术，这有包括工程画、机械原理材料力学和机件设计的机械设计课，也有包括电工和电子技术的电工电子学课等。我们重视这些课的原故是：在新科学、新技术的研究工作中，常常要设计比较复杂的实验装置，例如研究高速气动力问题就得有超声速的风洞，研究基本粒子物理就得有高能加速器；要设计这些设备就不能用敲敲打打的办法，必需进行比较正规的技术设计。因此基础技术的训练就非常必要了。
    我们重视基础课，不但可以从学时所占的比例上看出来，而且也可能从科技大学基础课的教师名单上看出来：在我们基础课教师中有中国科学院副院长、数理化学部学部委员、物理学家吴有训，有中国科学院数学研究所所长、数理化学部学部委员、数学家华罗庚，有中国科学院技术科学部主任、数理化学部学部委员、物理学家严济慈，有中国科学院化学研究所研究员、数理化学部学部委员、化学家王葆仁。其他基础课教师也都是中国科学院各研究所的高级研究人员。这些教师们在学术方面都是有成就的，知识面也广，因此他们对学科都有比较成熟和特有的看法；学生能和他们经常接触会得到深刻的启发。当然，这些高级研究人员的任务是很重的，再要抽出时间来讲课并不容易；但是为祖国迅速地培养一批尖端科学的青年干部，这是一项光荣的任务，再多白一些头发又算什么？
