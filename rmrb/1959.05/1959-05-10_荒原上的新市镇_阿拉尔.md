　　A New Town on the Wasteland—Aral
　　From Aksu, a place rich in rice, take a car and travel 130 kilometers southeast along a newly built, wide, and flat highway to reach Aral, the first new town on the Tarim wasteland.
　　Aral, close to the north bank of the Tarim River, is a place of beautiful scenery. The rushing waters of the Tarim River flow from its south and east, ceaselessly flowing from west to east. Most of the newly built houses here are hidden in the woods. Surrounding the woods are newly reclaimed fields crisscrossed by canals, and surrounding the fields is a primeval forest. How can people not be attached to and love such a beautiful place? But who knows that just a year ago, this was a barren wilderness, the most active world of wild animals. At that time, the master living on this land was an old Uyghur man named Reheman, who was over seventy years old. Apart from him and his few sheep, there were no other families on this vast land.
　　Since the production fighters of the People's Liberation Army came here in the winter of 1957, Aral has begun to show its youthful vitality, and old man Reheman has had his neighbors. Now, after people's labor, Aral has changed, and old man Reheman is living a younger life. In the past year, people have dug and repaired countless large and small canals in the vicinity of Aral, reclaimed more than 100,000 mu of land, built a bridge over the Tarim River, and built a highway to Aksu. In order to gradually build Aral into a beautiful riverside city, people have also carried out many other construction works here. In this way, Aral has become the first new town on the Tarim wasteland in a very short period.
　　Now, nearly 30,000 square meters of various types of bungalows and buildings have been built in the center of this new town and its surroundings. On both sides of a main street, beautiful and neat department stores, guest houses, guest dining halls, Xinhua bookstores, bus stations, post and telecommunications bureaus, and banks and other service units have been open for business for a long time, and receive local and visiting customers with a bridge-like service attitude. At the easternmost part of the town, a new type of Tarim Agricultural University has started classes. More than 700 young men and women sent here by various farms are studying, working, and living very happily. In a forest in the southeast direction near the Tarim River, a large-scale hospital planned to have 400 beds is under construction. By summer and autumn, 5,000 square meters of wards or other buildings will be built here one after another. In the north of the town, a medium-sized tractor repair factory was put into production last winter. Now, this repair factory not only undertakes the tractor repair tasks of various farms in the Tarim area, but also undertakes the task of providing electricity for night lighting in the town of Aral. In order to meet the needs of various construction projects for bricks and tiles, two large brick factories have been specially set up in the southeast direction of the town. The sideline processing team of Victory Fourteenth Farm has also set up many workshops here according to people's various requirements for food. In addition, people have also opened up a public activity place with their own labor. There are basketball courts and open-air stages. Now, Aral is no longer just old man Reheman's place, and its residents have increased to nearly three thousand people.
　　With the progress of the development work in the upper reaches of the Tarim River and the development of various production undertakings, the town of Aral will have great development in the near future. The personnel in charge of capital construction of the Agricultural Construction First Division told us that this year alone, the construction of houses will increase by about 30,000 square meters, and some multi-story buildings with larger construction areas and some factory buildings with higher engineering quality requirements will appear here one after another. People living in Aral, in order to make this beautiful place even more beautiful, have planted many willows and poplars by the canals, roads, and around the houses. People here express their confidence that they will, in a short period of time, transform Aral from the first town on the wasteland to the first beautiful city in the Tarim area.

### 荒原上的新市镇——阿拉尔

　　荒原上的新市镇——阿拉尔
    从盛产稻谷的阿克苏搭上汽车，沿着一条新建的宽阔而平坦的公路，向东南方向行一百三十公里，就到了塔里木荒原上的第一座新市镇——阿拉尔。
    阿拉尔，靠近塔里木河的北岸，是个风景幽美的地方。滚滚的塔里木河水，从它的南边和东边流过，日夜不停地从西向东流去。这里新建设的大部分房屋，都隐藏在树林之中。而树林的周围，是一片新垦的渠道纵横的田野，包围着田野的，又是一片原始森林。这样美丽的地方，叫人怎能不留恋、热爱。但是，谁知道在一年前，这里却是一片荒林漠土，是野元最活跃的世界。当时，生活在这块土地上的主人，是一位年纪已经过了七十岁的维吾尔族老大爷热合满，除了他和他的几只羊外，这广阔的土地上，就再没有别的人家了。
    自从1957年冬天，人民解放军的生产战士来到这里之后，阿拉尔才开始显示了她的青春活力，热合满老大爷才有了自己的邻居。现在，经过人们的劳动，阿拉尔已经变了样，热合满老大爷活得更年轻了。过去的一年里，人们在阿拉尔的附近，挖修了无数的大小渠道，开垦了十多万亩土地，兴建了塔里木河上的大桥，修通了到阿克苏的公路。人们为了把阿拉尔逐步地建设成一个美丽的河滨城市，在这里还进行了许许多多的其他建设工作。这样，阿拉尔便在很短的时间里，变成为塔里木荒原上的第一个新市镇了。
    现在，这个新市镇的中心和它的周围，已经修建起近三万平方公尺的各种结构的平房和楼房。在一条大街的两旁，漂亮而整齐的百货商店、招待所、招待食堂、新华书店、汽车站、邮电局和银行等服务性的单位已开业多时，并以天桥式的服务态度，接待着本地的和来往的各种顾客。在市镇的最东边，一所新型的塔里木农业大学已经开学上课。由各农场送到这里学习的七百多名男女青年，学习、劳动和生活都过得十分愉快。在东南方向靠近塔里木河的一个树林里，一个规模很大的准备设有四百张病床的医院正在修建，到了夏秋之间，这里就会有五千平方公尺的病房或其他房屋陆续建成。在市镇的北边，一个中型的拖拉机修配厂在去年冬天就投入了生产。现在这个修配厂，除担负着塔里木地区各农场的拖拉机修配任务，还担负着阿拉尔市镇的夜间照明用电。人们为了满足各项建筑工程对砖瓦的需要，在市镇的东南方向还专门设了两个很大的烧砖厂。胜利十四场的副业加工队，根据人们对食品的各种要求，在这里还设立了不少的作坊。此外，人们以自己的劳动，还开辟了一个公共活动场所。这里有篮球场，也有露天戏台。现在，阿拉尔再不是热合满老大爷一个人了，而它的居民已增加到快三千人了。
    随着塔里木河上游地区开发工作的进展和各项生产事业的发展，阿拉尔市镇在不久的将来还会有很大的发展。农一师管理基本建设工作的人员告诉我们，在今年以内，这里仅房屋建筑一项，就要增加三万平方公尺左右，一些建筑面积较大的楼房和一些工程质量要求较高的厂房，在这里就要陆续出现。生活在阿拉尔的人们，为了使这个美丽的地方建设得更加美丽，每一个人都在渠边、路旁和房屋的周围，栽了很多的柳树和杨树。这里的人们满怀信心地表示，他们要在较短的时间内，使阿拉尔由现在荒原上的第一个市镇，变成为塔里木地区的第一座美丽城市。
