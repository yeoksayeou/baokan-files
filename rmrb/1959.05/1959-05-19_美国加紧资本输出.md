**Increased Capital Exports**

Since the end of the war, US monopoly capital has been striving to intensify capital exports, engaging in economic aggression and expansion, exploiting cheap overseas labor, and plundering the natural resources of other countries to obtain huge profits several times greater than those at home. From 1946 to 1957, the rate of capital export by major US companies was astonishing: private foreign direct investment increased two and a half times, far exceeding the foreign investment of the old rentier country, Britain. During this period, the profits of US overseas investment companies increased by more than 250%, while the profits of domestic investment increased by less than 50%.

According to US official statistics, in 1957, the total US foreign investment reached 54.2 billion US dollars, about three times that of Britain's foreign investment; of which the private sector accounted for 36.8 billion US dollars, and the government sector accounted for 17.4 billion US dollars. The above-mentioned US official statistics are actually much lower than the actual investment figures. This is because it is calculated based on the book value of the overseas assets of major US companies, rather than the market value of the assets. The US Department of Commerce's "Survey of Current Business," August 1956 issue, pointed out that "the market value of direct investment is likely to exceed the book value by more than double," and only the market value can "more accurately reflect the production capacity and profit rate of these enterprises." In addition, if we include the hidden assets and accounting fraud made by US overseas companies to evade taxes, then the magnitude of US private overseas investment is even more astonishing. The US "Business Week" estimated in January this year that the enterprises controlled by US capital abroad last year had a total production and sales value of more than 30 billion US dollars, nearly double the total value of US non-military goods exports last year, which was 16.3 billion US dollars. The scale of US private overseas investment is thus evident.

However, although the US overseas plunder has reached such an alarming scale, it cannot solve the increasingly serious problem of capital and commodity "surplus" in the United States. With the large-scale concentration of domestic private capital and the sluggishness of the domestic market in recent years, seeking outlets for the "surplus" capital of large monopoly companies has become a "top priority" for Washington policymakers.

As early as October 1957, US Vice President Nixon proposed a plan at the "International Industrial Development Conference" held in San Francisco for the US to "greatly increase the export of private surplus capital," requiring "to double or double (US) foreign investment in the next ten years." He said that the United States should also strive to reach the "proportion of foreign investment in national income occupied by Britain before World War I" in 1910. According to this proportion, the annual increase in US foreign investment "should not be 4 billion US dollars a year, but nearly 30 billion US dollars." "Fortune" magazine, sponsored by the Rockefeller Consortium, has also been advocating that in the next ten years, private foreign investment should be increased to at least 90 billion US dollars, so that "Wall Street will play the role of world banker that London played in the nineteenth century."

Under such circumstances, the Eisenhower government, which loyally serves the US big monopoly capital, successively proposed several measures to encourage capital export in its budget, economic, and "foreign aid" messages to Congress in January this year. To sum up, there are three aspects: (1) The US government will assume more "risks" for private foreign investment and give more "preferential treatment." It will require the enactment of laws to further ensure that private investors "do not lose capital (abroad) due to revolution, rebellion, and related struggles." The US government will also consider tax cuts for private overseas investment. (2) The US government will try its best to force other countries to create a "favorable atmosphere" for US private investment through the conclusion of bilateral agreements, etc. (3) The United States will "partner" with other capitalist countries through international institutions and regional organizations to promote the export of US private capital.

**Expansion into Underdeveloped Countries**

Intensifying the export of private capital to economically underdeveloped countries, especially to countries in Asia and Africa, is the main plan of the US big monopoly capital groups for economic expansion.

According to US official statistics, nearly half of US private foreign direct investment in 1957 was invested in underdeveloped regions (US private direct investment in Latin America accounted for 35% of total US private foreign direct investment, the Middle East and Africa accounted for 9%, and underdeveloped countries in the Far East accounted for nearly 3%). The United States is particularly interested in exporting capital to these regions because it can plunder more huge profits from the cheap labor and raw materials in these regions. In 1957, the profits that the United States obtained from private direct investment in Latin America, the Middle East, and Africa accounted for 56% of the total profits of foreign direct investment, but the investment itself only accounted for 44% of the total investment.

The United States already has a monopoly position in Latin American investment, and of course it wants to further strengthen it in the future. According to US official statistics, 40% of the increased US private foreign direct investment in 1957 continued to flow into Latin America. However, because the amount of US investment in Latin America is already quite large (according to official statistics, private investment in 1957 reached 11 billion US dollars, of which direct investment was 8.8 billion US dollars), about half of the annual increase in investment there is reinvestment of profits. Therefore, it can no longer solve the problem of exporting the "surplus capital" of the US monopoly bourgeoisie, and new investment markets must be opened up. In the early post-war period, US investors, seeing the rise of national independence movements in Asia and Africa, believed that the region was "too risky" and hesitated to come. In the past one or two years, they have been eagerly trying to drill into Asia and Africa.

In October 1957, the US government proposed a four-point plan to "encourage" the inflow of US capital into Asia to the meeting of the "American Far East Industrial and Commercial Council" (an organization of American capitalists engaged in business and investment in Asia). Some leading figures of the Rockefeller Consortium also personally visited some Asian countries the year before, and after returning to the United States, they gave speeches, pointing out that US private investment in Asia at that time was "only 600 million US dollars," which was much less than US investment in Canada and Latin America, and must be greatly increased. US investment in Africa has also increased rapidly in recent years (according to official statistics, private direct investment increased from 100 million US dollars in 1950 to more than 300 million US dollars in 1957). After visiting Africa in 1957, US Vice President Nixon emphasized that US private capital cannot miss the "favorable" opportunity to invest in Africa. The Morgan Consortium has long been actively extending into Africa, and recently David Rockefeller, one of the leading figures of the Rockefeller Group, also personally went to African countries for a five-week "trip." After returning to the United States in March this year, he said that his Chase Manhattan Bank would set up more strongholds in Africa. He admitted that "the nationalist movement is the most important fact in Africa today," but he advocated that US investors must "take risks." He said, "Anyway, it is necessary to take risks wherever you go."

US private investment in the Asian region is using national investment ("aid," loans, etc.) to pave the way and "assume risks" in advance. This is the reason why the US government's "economic and technical assistance" to the Asian region has increased in recent years.

US direct investment in underdeveloped countries is concentrated on exploiting oil and minerals. According to official statistics, almost all of the US's 1.2 billion US dollars in direct investment in the Middle East in 1957 was invested in the oil industry. In the Middle East, Africa, the Far East, and Latin American underdeveloped countries, investment in the oil industry and mineral mining and smelting industries accounts for 60% of total direct investment. The actual share is even larger, because US official statistics classify the primary processing industry of raw materials and the raw material transportation industry under manufacturing and other items, and these industries are directly serving the plunder of raw materials. Just as the British Empire once dreamed of being a "world workshop," US imperialists are currently advocating that the United States should try to "benefit" from the "universal implementation of production specialization" in the world to "strengthen the US economy" (speech by Dillon, Undersecretary of State for Economic Affairs, on February 19 this year). Their so-called "production specialization" is to make underdeveloped countries places for the United States to plunder raw materials, exploit cheap labor, and dump commodities. At the Seattle meeting of the "Colombo Plan" in November last year and the subsequent Washington Conference of 21 American countries, the US representatives were very cold to the requests made by Southeast Asian and Latin American countries regarding stabilizing raw material prices and helping industrialization, and the reason is not difficult to understand.

**Penetration into Allied Markets**

US monopoly capital has not relaxed its penetration into other economically developed capitalist countries.

According to US official statistics, in 1957, US private direct investment in Canada accounted for 33% of the total foreign direct investment (8.3 billion US dollars), in Western Europe accounted for 16% (nearly 4 billion US dollars), and there was also a lot of direct investment in Japan, Australia, and New Zealand (a total of more than 830 million US dollars). A considerable amount of US direct investment in these countries is also placed in the exploitation of oil and minerals, but compared with its direct investment in underdeveloped countries, a relatively large part is invested in the manufacturing sector, especially in Western Europe and Canada. At a time when capitalist countries caught in economic crisis are engaged in fierce trade wars, US monopoly capital is even more frantically carrying out the so-called "moving enterprises abroad to produce" movement in order to further drill into the markets of these countries.

The result of US control of a large amount of manufacturing in Canada has made it possible to conveniently enter the British Empire market from there. In the past one or two years, due to the economic recession in Canada, the growing Canadian monopoly bourgeoisie is increasingly dissatisfied with the control of US capital, and the speed of investment increase there has encountered difficulties.

Nearly half of US direct investment in Western Europe is invested in the British mainland (according to US official figures, it was 1.9 billion US dollars in 1957). British economist Dunning pointed out in his book "American Investment in British Manufacturing Industry" published in 1958 that in 1955, two out of every five cars produced by the British automobile industry were manufactured by American companies, and 60%-70% of the agricultural machinery produced in Britain in 1954 were American company products... One-eighth of British exports are produced by 250 enterprises controlled by US capital. Recently, US investment in the UK continues to increase sharply. At the beginning of this year, US capital controlled the only aluminum company in the UK, British Aluminum. In addition to the infiltration of the British mainland, the US capital expansion in various regions of the world is also hitting the British sphere of influence in many occasions. For example, before World War II, the British oil investment in the Middle East was twice that of the United States, and now the US oil investment in the Middle East is two and a half times that of the British. More than 90% of British investment in the Commonwealth is concentrated in Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and the Federation of South Africa, but Canada has long been controlled by US capital, and in the other three countries, the total amount of British investment in 1950 was nine times that of the United States, but now it has fallen to five times that of the United States. The British "Sunday Express" exclaimed in January this year: "Stop the Americans" to prevent Britain from "becoming a hollow shell under the march of the gold dollar imperialism."

At the beginning of this year, the establishment of the "Common Market" of the six Western European countries also promoted the large-scale penetration of US private capital. In order to "knock on the door of the European market from the inside," US investors have been snapping up the stocks of Western European companies since the fourth quarter of last year. Last year, Americans bought 138 million US dollars worth of stocks in Western European companies, of which 73 million US dollars were bought in the fourth quarter. In January and February of this year, the rate of stock acquisitions continued to maintain the rate of the fourth quarter of last year. The United States has a complex relationship with West Germany, the leader of the Western European "Common Market." US capital further penetrated into West Germany after World War II, colluding with and supporting West German monopoly capital as the main helper of the United States in its European aggression and expansion. At present, the United States still controls West Germany and can also use the favorable conditions of the "Common Market" to export capital and raw materials to Western Europe. However, West Germany, which has gradually become full-fledged, has begun to pose a threat to the United States in terms of commodity exports. West Germany's gold and dollar reserves are more than 6 billion US dollars, and it is also implementing a huge plan for foreign investment. The US policy of supporting West Germany will eventually backfire.

**Intensified Contradictions and Increasing Difficulties**

However, the US plan to intensify the export of capital to economically underdeveloped countries and industrially developed countries has encountered increasing resistance. Due to the rise of national independence movements in Asia and Africa and the increasingly acute struggle between Western European monopoly capital groups and the United States for markets, it is very difficult for the United States to realize the kind of economic aggression plan proposed by Nixon and "Fortune" magazine. Last year was the first year after these plans were proposed. According to preliminary estimates, US private foreign investment increased by only 3.4 billion US dollars this year, which is lower than the increase in 1956 and 1957.

US monopoly capital will of course work harder to promote their plans in the future. The Rockefeller Consortium, one of the most rampant US overseas economic expansion consortiums, issued a report last year advocating intensifying the nuclear arms race and preparing for "limited wars." This kind of "limited war" is primarily intended to suppress the vigorously developing national independence movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. The armed invasion of Lebanon last year for the benefit of US oil investment in the Middle East was an "experiment." If the Western European capitalist countries initially expanded outward with trade followed by military flags, then the United States is private investment followed by military flags.

The United States, due to a series of disastrous defeats internationally, is in a very isolated situation and has recently been publicizing its preparation to change to adopt certain "flexible policies" and "improve relations" with nationally independent countries and Western allies. However, the fundamental determinant of a country's foreign policy is its economic foundation. Judging from the development of the US economic crisis and the way out sought by US monopoly capital, although the United States will play tricks in diplomacy, its basic policy will not change.

The contradictions between US imperialism and national independence and countries that are striving for national independence will inevitably continue to intensify, which has been fully reflected in the Seattle meeting of the Colombo Plan Organization and the recent meeting of the Committee of 21 American Countries. The contradictions between the United States and other capitalist countries will also continue to sharpen. The capitalist world market is constantly shrinking, and the economic expansion and aggression of US imperialism is encountering increasing resistance.

    美国加紧资本输出
    万光
    资本输出的增加
    战后以来，美国垄断资本一直在竭力加紧输出资本，实行经济侵略和扩张，剥削海外的廉价劳动力，搜刮其他国家天然富源以取得数倍于国内的巨额利润。从1946年到1957年期间，美国各大公司的资本输出速度十分惊人：私人对外直接投资增加了二倍半，远远超过了老牌食利国——英国的对外投资额。在这期间，美国海外投资公司的利润增加了250％以上，而国内投资的利润增加不到50％。
    按照美国官方统计， 1957年美国对外投资总额达到五百四十二亿美元，约三倍于英国的对外投资；其中私人部分占三百六十八亿美元，政府部分占一百七十四亿美元。上述美国官方的统计实际上大大低于实际投资数字。因为这是按照美国各大公司海外资产的账面价值计算，而非按资产的市价计算的结果。美国商务部出版的“商业现况调查”1956年8月号就指出，
  “直接投资的市价很可能超出账面价值一倍以上”，只有市价才“能较正确地反映出这些企业的生产能力和利润率”。此外，如果把美国各海外公司为逃避赋税而作的隐避资产、账面舞弊等估计在内，那末美国私人海外投资的庞大就更惊人，美国“商业周刊”今年1月曾估计，美国资本在国外控制的企业去年在生产和销货方面高达三百亿美元以上，超过去年美国本国非军事货物的输出总值一百六十三亿美元近一倍。美国私人海外投资的规模之大，由此也可见一斑了。
    可是，尽管美国的海外掠夺已达到如此惊人的规模，但是这并不能解决美国国内日益严重的资本和商品的“过剩”问题。随着近年来美国国内私人资本的大量集中，国内市场的一蹶不振，于是为大垄断公司的“过剩”资本寻求出路，就更加成为华盛顿决策人的“当务之急了。”
    早在1957年10月，美国副总统尼克松就向在旧金山举行的“国际工业发展会议”提出了一个美国“大大增加私人剩余资本输出”的方案，要求“在今后十年内把（美国）对外投资增加一倍或两倍”。他说，美国还要争取达到英国在第一次世界大战前“1910年对外投资在国民收入中所占的比例”，按照这个比例，美国每年增加的对外投资“应当不是一年四十亿美元，而是将近三百亿美元”。洛克菲勒财团主办的“幸福”杂志也一直鼓吹，在今后十年内，起码要把（美国）私人对外投资增加到九百亿美元，使“华尔街充当伦敦在十九世纪所充当的世界银行家的角色”。
    在这样一种情况下，为美国大垄断资本忠心耿耿服务的艾森豪威尔政府遂于今年1月致国会的预算、经济、“援外”咨文里，陆续提出了若干鼓励资本输出的措施。归纳起来，有三个方面：（一）美国政府将替私人对外投资承担更多“风险”，给予更多“优惠”。它将要求制定法律，进一步保证私人投资家“不致因革命、叛乱和与此有关的斗争而（在国外）丧失资本”。美国政府还将考虑对私人海外投资实行减税。（二）美国政府将通过缔结双边协定等，竭力设法迫使其他国家为美国私人投资创造“有利气氛”。（三）美国通过国际机构及区域性组织同其他资本主义国家“合伙”，来促进美国的私人资本输出。
    对不发达国家的扩张
    加紧向经济不发达国家特别是向亚洲和非洲地区国家输出私人资本，是美国大垄断资本集团经济扩张的主要计划。
    据美国官方统计，1957年美国私人对外直接投资接近一半是投在不发达地区的（在拉丁美洲的美国私人直接投资占美国私人对外直接投资总额的35％，中东和非洲占9％，在远东不发达国家占近3％）。美国特别有兴趣于向这些地区输出资本，是因为从这些地区的低廉劳动力和原料中可以掠夺到更庞大的利润。1957年，美国从拉丁美洲、中东和非洲私人直接投资中所获得的利润占对外直接投资总利润的56％，但投资本身在投资总额中只占44％。
    美国在拉丁美洲的投资已经居于垄断地位，今后当然还想进一步加强。据美国官方统计，1957年增加的美国私人对外直接投资里，继续有40％流入拉丁美洲。不过，由于美国在拉丁美洲的投资数额已经相当大（官方统计，1957年私人投资达一百一十亿美元，其中直接投资八十八亿美元），那里每年增加的投资，有一半左右是利润的再投资。因此它已不大能解决美国垄断资产阶级国内“过剩资本”的输出，而必须开辟新的投资市场。战后初期，美国投资家曾因看到亚非地区民族独立运动高涨，认为这个地区“风险太大”，迟迟不敢前来。近一、二年来，他们已急不可待地设法钻进亚非地区来了。
    1957年10月，美国政府曾向“美国远东工商业理事会”会议（在亚洲经商和投资的美国资本家的组织），提出过一个“鼓励”美国资本流入亚洲的四点计划。洛克菲勒财团的一些首脑人物前年还亲自访问了一些亚洲国家，在返美后发表演说，指出美国在亚洲的私人投资当时还“只有六亿美元”，比起美国在加拿大和拉丁美洲的投资来要少得多，必须大量增加。美国对非洲的投资近几年增加得也很快（据官方统计，私人直接投资从1950年的一亿美元增加到1957年的三亿多美元）。美国副总统尼克松1957年访问非洲后，强调美国私人资本不能放过在非洲投资的“优厚”机会。摩根财团早已积极向非洲伸入，最近洛克菲勒集团首脑人物之一戴维·洛克菲勒也亲自前去非洲国家作了五个星期的“旅行”，他在今年3月返回美国后说，他的曼哈顿大通银行要在非洲设立更多的据点。他承认“民族主义运动是非洲今天一个最重要的事实”，但是他主张美国投资家必须“冒险”，他说，“反正不论到哪里都是要冒险的”。
    美国对亚洲地区的私人投资，是用国家投资（“援助”、贷款等）来开路，并先行“承担风险”。这是美国政府对亚洲地区的“经济和技术援助”近几年来有所增加的原因。
    美国对不发达国家的直接投资，集中在开采石油和矿藏上。据官方统计，1957年美国在中东的十二亿美元直接投资，几乎全部是投在石油业。在中东、非洲、远东、拉丁美洲不发达国家直接投资总计起来，石油业及矿藏开采和冶炼业方面的投资占60％。实际份额比这还要大，因为美国官方统计是把原料初步加工业和原料运输业归在制造业等其他项目下的，而这些行业都是直接为掠夺原料事业服务的。像大英帝国过去曾经梦想要作“世界作坊”一样，美帝国主义者目前也在鼓吹美国要设法从“全世界普遍实行的生产专业化”中“得到利益”，以“加强美国经济”（负责经济事务的副国务卿狄龙今年2月19日的演说）。他们所谓“生产专业化”，就是要把不发达国家作为美国掠夺原料、剥削廉价劳动力、倾销商品的场所。在去年11月“科伦坡计划”西雅图会议以及随后美洲二十一国华盛顿会议上，美国代表对于东南亚和拉丁美洲国家提出的有关稳定原料价格和帮助工业化的要求，态度十分冷淡，道理也就不难明白了。
    向盟国市场的渗透
    美国垄断资本也没有放松向其他经济发达的资本主义国家进行渗透。
    据美国官方统计，1957年，美国在加拿大的私人直接投资占对外直接投资总额的33％
  （八十三亿美元），在西欧占16％（近四十亿美元），在日本、澳大利亚和新西兰也有不少直接投资（共八亿三千多万美元）。美国在这些国家的相当数量的直接投资也是放在开采石油和矿藏方面，不过同它对不发达国家的直接投资相比，则有比较大的一部分是投在制造业部门，特别是在西欧和加拿大。当此陷入经济危机中的资本主义国家之间展开激烈贸易战之际，美国垄断资本更狂热地进行着所谓“把企业搬到国外生产”的运动，以便进一步钻入这些国家的市场。
    美国控制加拿大大量制造业的结果，已经使它可以从那里方便地进入英帝国市场。近一、二年由于加拿大经济衰退，加拿大成长起来的垄断资产阶级对美国资本的控制日益不满，美国在那里投资增加的速度已遇到了困难。
    美国在西欧的直接投资，将近一半是投在英国本土（据美国官方数字，1957年为十九亿美元）。英国经济学家邓宁在1958年出版的“英国加工工业中的美国投资”一书里指出，1955年英国汽车工业生产的小轿车每五辆中就有两辆是美国公司制造的，1954年英国生产的农业机器中60％—70％是美国公司产品，……英国出口商品中八分之一是由受美国资本控制的二百五十家企业生产的。最近，美国对英国的投资继续在急剧增加，今年年初美国资本又控制了英国唯一的一家制铝公司——不列颠制铝公司。除掉对英国本土的渗入外，美国在世界各地区的资本扩张也在很多场合打进英国势力范围。例如第二次世界大战前英国在中东的石油投资为美国的两倍，现在是美国在中东的石油投资为英国的两倍半。英国在英联邦的投资90％以上集中在加拿大、澳大利亚、新西兰和南非联邦四国，但加拿大早已为美国资本所控制，而在其他三国，1950年英国的投资总额还为美国的九倍，现在已经下降为美国的五倍。英国“星期日快报”今年1月惊呼：要“挡住美国人”，防止英国“在金元帝国主义进军下成为一个空壳”。
    今年年初，西欧六国“共同市场”的成立，也促进了美国私人资本的大量渗入。为了“从内部来敲开欧洲市场的门户”，美国投资家从去年第四季起大肆抢购西欧公司的股票。去年一年美国人购进西欧公司的股票就达一亿三千八百万美元，其中七千三百万美元是在第四季度购进的。今年1、2月份，在收购股票上继续保持着去年第四季度的速率。美国同西欧“共同市场”盟主西德，有着错综复杂的关系。美国资本在第二次世界大战后进一步伸入西德，勾结和扶植西德垄断资本，作为美国在欧洲侵略扩张的主要帮手。目前，美国仍然控制着西德，还能够利用“共同市场”的有利条件来向西欧输出资本和原料。然而，羽毛逐渐丰满起来的西德在商品出口等方面已经开始对美国形成威胁。西德黄金美元储备已有六十多亿美元，也正在推行国外投资的庞大计划。美国扶植西德的政策到头来将搬起石头砸自己的脚。
    矛盾加剧　困难日增
    不过，美国向经济不发达国家和工业发达国家加紧输出资本的计划已经遇到越来越大的阻力。由于亚非地区民族独立运动的高涨和西欧垄断资本集团同美国争夺市场斗争的日趋尖锐，美国要实现尼克松、“幸福”杂志提出的那种经济侵略计划，是十分困难的。去年是这些计划提出后的第一年，据初步估计，美国私人对外投资这一年只增加了三十四亿美元，还低于1956年和1957年增加的数字。
    美国垄断资本今后当然会更加竭力来推行他们的计划。美国海外经济扩张最猖獗的财团之一——洛克菲勒财团，去年提出报告，鼓吹加紧核军备竞赛和准备“有限战争”。这种“有限战争”首先就是想用来镇压亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲蓬勃开展的民族独立运动。为了美国在中东的石油投资利益，去年武装侵略黎巴嫩，便是一次“实验”。如果说当初西欧资本主义国家向外扩张是贸易后面跟着军旗，那么美国则是私人投资后面跟军旗。
    美国由于在国际上遭到一连串惨败，处境十分孤立，近来正在宣传准备改而采取某些“灵活政策”，同民族独立国家以及西方盟国“改善关系”。但是，根本决定一国对外政策的是经济基础。从美国经济危机的发展以及美国垄断资本谋求的出路来看，美国外交上虽然尽管会玩花样，但是基本政策是不会变的。
    美帝国主义同民族独立以及正在争取民族独立的国家间的矛盾必将不断加剧，这在科伦坡计划组织的西雅图会议和最近举行的美洲二十一国委员会会议都已充分反映出来。美国同其他资本主义国家的矛盾也将不断尖锐化。资本主义世界市场正在不断缩小，美帝国主义的经济扩张和侵略，正在遭遇到越来越大的反抗。
