Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, May 10th: According to TASS, the Soviet delegation to the East-West Foreign Ministers Conference, led by Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko, arrived in Geneva on May 9th aboard an "Il-18" aircraft.

Those who welcomed the Soviet delegation at the airport included Amman, a representative of the Swiss Federal Political Department (i.e., the Ministry of Foreign Affairs), representatives of the Geneva local authorities, Soviet Ambassador to Switzerland Kolyukin, the delegation of the German Democratic Republic headed by Foreign Minister Bolz of the German Democratic Republic, which had arrived in Geneva earlier, and representatives of diplomatic missions of some countries.

Upon arriving in Geneva, Gromyko made a statement to reporters.

Gromyko said that the task of the Foreign Ministers Conference is to do practical work. People of all countries are expecting governments to make decisions that will lead to an easing of international tensions. These wishes must be fulfilled, and the root causes of this tension must be addressed.

Gromyko pointed out that the mission of the Foreign Ministers Conference is to study the most important and mature issues in current international relations—the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany and the elimination of the occupation regime in West Berlin. The adoption of unanimous resolutions on these two issues would greatly contribute to the easing of international tensions and would be an important contribution to strengthening peace in Europe.

Gromyko said: "The Soviet delegation has come here (Geneva) to correctly resolve these important issues. Our intentions are serious, and we will make every effort to make this conference a success. We hope that the Geneva Foreign Ministers Conference will prepare the ground for the upcoming summit meeting of heads of government so that the heads of government can make resolutions that will ensure that the development of the international situation will completely shift towards the elimination of the danger of a new war."

Gromyko concluded by saying that the Soviet government believes that there are currently the necessary conditions for preventing a new war and ensuring lasting peace in the world.

Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, May 10th: According to TASS, the delegation of the German Democratic Republic, headed by Foreign Minister Bolz of the German Democratic Republic, arrived in Geneva on May 9th by special train to participate in the East-West Foreign Ministers Conference.

Representatives of the Swiss government and the Geneva local authorities welcomed the delegation at the station.

At the station, Bolz made a brief statement to reporters, saying that we have come to attend the meeting with certain principles, which are known to the whole world and have been approved by all the parliamentary groups in the People's Chamber. We have come here to help the conference succeed.

Bolz said: "Our delegation has come to Geneva as the German Democratic Republic has been established for ten years. The existence of the German Democratic Republic is a decisive fact for maintaining the peace of our people and the whole world."

The members of the delegation of the German Democratic Republic who came with Bolz included: Deputy Foreign Minister Wenzel, State Secretary Toeplitz, and Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Standing Committee of the People's Chamber, Florin.
