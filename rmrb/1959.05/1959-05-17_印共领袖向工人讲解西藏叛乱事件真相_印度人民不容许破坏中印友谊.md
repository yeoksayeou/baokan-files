Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 16th - Indian Communist and trade union leader, Sankarayya, at a grand workers' rally held in Madurai, Madras State on the 14th, explained in detail the truth about the Tibetan rebellion at the request of a group of textile workers.

Sankarayya said that Tibet is a part of China, and it is natural for China to feel displeased with foreign interference in its internal affairs.

He said that the Tibetan rebellion was not an "uprising," but "a rebellion by a few feudal elements against progress and socialism. Those who support the rebellion of the stubborn feudal aristocrats of Tibet actually want to create a rift between India and China. In reality, they have no affection for the Buddhist faith or for Tibet, a backward region in need of rapid progress.”

He said that their interests and sympathy did not extend beyond the boundaries defined by the U.S. State Department.

In his speech, he traced the long history of friendship between India and China for two thousand years. He said, "This friendship has stood many tests and lasted for many centuries without being affected in the slightest." He also said that the Indian people will never allow any actions against the permanent friendship and unity between them and the great and friendly Chinese people.

After he finished speaking, the more than 5,000 textile workers present unanimously shouted: "Tibet is a part of China!" "Long live Sino-Indian friendship!"

    印共领袖向工人讲解西藏叛乱事件真相
    印度人民不容许破坏中印友谊
    新华社新德里16日电　印度共产党和印度工会的一位领袖桑卡腊亚14日在马德拉斯邦马都拉地方举行的一次盛大的工人集会上，应一批纺织工人的要求而详尽地讲解了西藏叛乱事件的真相。
    桑卡腊亚说，西藏是中国的一部分，中国对外国干涉它的内政感到不愉快是自然的。
    他说，西藏叛乱事件不是什么“起义”，“而是少数封建分子反对进步和反对社会主义的叛乱。那些支持西藏顽固的封建贵族的叛乱的人实际上是想在印中两国之间造成裂痕。真正说来，他们对佛教这种信仰和西藏这块需要迅速进步的落后地区，都没有什么感情。”
    他说，他们的兴趣和同情并没有超出美国国务院所确定的界限。
    他在讲话中回溯了印中两国两千年的悠久的友谊。他说，“这种友谊经过了许多考验、经历了许多世纪而丝毫没有受到影响”。他又说，印度人民决不允许反对他们同伟大友好的中国人民的永久友谊和团结的任何行动。
    在他讲完以后，到会的五千多名纺织工人一致高呼：“西藏是中国的一部分！”“印中友谊万岁！”
