Xinhua News Agency, 21st. New Delhi Dispatch: Since the Indian People's Assembly concluded the so-called "Debate on the Tibetan Question" on May 8th, the so-called "Tibetan refugee" issue has become one of the daily topics of discussion in some Indian newspapers. Especially in recent days, these newspapers and Western news agency reporters have been spreading a large number of rumors that slander China and distort the truth about the Tibetan rebellion in the form of reporting on "refugee" talks.

According to a report by the Indian Press Trust, Nanda, the responsible official sent by the Indian government to the Misamari "refugee camp," announced on the 15th that no one was allowed to meet with the "refugees" inside the "refugee camp," not even the press. Private translators were also not allowed to enter the camp. He said that the government had taken restrictive measures to stop the spread of fabricated and distorted news.

However, according to a report by the "Statesman" reporter from Tezpur on the 17th, on May 15th, "(official) restrictions on reporters have been greatly relaxed. Reporters and photographers can move freely in the (refugee camp) huts."

In fact, a large group of Western news agencies and Indian newspaper reporters have already sent so-called "stories" of direct interviews with Tibetan "refugees" from Misamari.

On May 15th, the Associated Press issued a message from Misamari quoting a former Tibetan local government official as saying that the Potala Palace had been bombed.

On May 17th, Reuters reporter Jackson sent a message from Tezpur quoting a "refugee" as saying that about 400 Ladakhis studying in Lhasa had left there "because the Chinese were shouting and chopping off people's heads and setting fire to houses."

The Indian "Statesman" has published almost daily rumors "interviewed" by its special correspondent in the past few days.

The newspaper's correspondent in Kalimpong fabricated rumors that Lhasa was shrouded in terror again, and that landlords and former Tibetan officials were being publicly tried by people's courts. Those sentenced were immediately executed, and their bodies were displayed in the streets. The reporter also said that the water in a river near Lhasa could no longer be used because corpses were rotting in the river.

Several major English newspapers in India, such as the "Times of India," the "Indian Express," and the "Hindustan Times," also frequently publish news and photos of Tibetan "refugees" or publish defamatory remarks about China regarding Tibetan "refugees." The "Times of India" also uses Tibetan "refugees" as a topic to incite movements to interfere in China's internal affairs. In its editorial on May 13th, it said: The existence of Tibetan "refugees" "will constantly remind us of this tragedy, about which the final opinion remains to be expressed."

According to Indian newspaper reports, some of the numerous "organizations" that were hastily established in India after the Tibetan rebellion are using the name of "relief for refugees" to carry out various activities. According to news from the "Times of India," the so-called "Central Relief Committee for Tibetans" chaired by People's Socialist Party leader Acharya Kripalani established its "Bombay State Committee" in Bombay on the 15th, with industrialist Lalchand Hirachand as chairman. News on May 20th said that the "Relief Committee for Tibetans" was also established in Madras.

### 印度一些报纸和西方记者  借“西藏难民”问题诽谤我国

    印度一些报纸和西方记者
    借“西藏难民”问题诽谤我国
    新华社21日讯　新德里消息：自从印度人民院5月8日结束了所谓“西藏问题的辩论”以后，所谓“西藏难民”问题已经成为印度一些报纸每天谈论的主题之一。特别是最近几天来，这些报纸和西方通讯社的记者们用报道“难民”谈话的形式，散布了大量诬蔑中国、歪曲西藏叛乱真相的谣言。
    据印度报业托辣斯报道，印度政府派往米萨马里“难民营”的负责官员南达15日曾经宣布，任何人不许会见“难民营”内的“难民”，即使报界也不许。私人译员也不许进入营内。他说，政府已经采取了限制性措施以制止流传捏造的和歪曲的消息。
    但是，据17日“政治家报”记者自提斯浦尔报道，在5月15日“（官方）对记者的限制已大大放宽。记者和摄影记者可以在（“难民营”）茅屋中自由活动。”
    事实上，一大群西方通讯社和印度报纸的记者从米萨马里已经发出直接采访西藏“难民”的所谓“故事”。
    美联社15日从米萨马里发出一条消息引用一个前西藏地方政府官员的“难民”的话说，布达拉宫遭到了轰炸。
    5月17日路透社的记者杰克逊从提斯浦尔发了一条消息引述一个“难民”的话说，约有四百个在拉萨学习的拉达克人离开了那里，“因为中国人在大叫大嚷和砍掉人的脑袋以及放火烧房子。”
    印度“政治家报”在过去的几天当中，几乎每天都登有它的特派记者“采访”到的谣言。
    这家报纸驻噶伦堡记者造谣说，拉萨重新笼罩着恐怖，那里的地主和前西藏官员，都受到人民法庭的公开审判。被判处者立即处决，他们的尸体就摆在街上。记者又说，拉萨附近一条河中的水已经不能用了，因为尸体在河里腐烂了。
    印度几家英文大报如“印度时报”、“印度快报”和“印度斯坦时报”等也经常刊登西藏“难民”的消息和照片或者就西藏“难民”发表诽谤中国的言论。“印度时报”还把西藏“难民”作为煽动干涉中国内政的运动的一个题目。它在5月13日的社论中说：西藏“难民”的存在“将经常使我们想起这场悲剧，关于这个悲剧，尚待发表最后的意见。”
    根据印度报纸报道，印度一些在西藏叛乱发生以后匆匆建立起来的名目繁多的“组织”，正利用“救济难民”的名义进行种种活动。据“印度时报”消息说，由人民社会党头子阿恰里雅·克里帕拉尼主持的所谓“中央救济西藏人委员会”15日在孟买成立了它的“孟买邦委员会”，由大工业家拉利汉德·希拉钱德担任主席。5月20日的报纸消息说，马德拉斯也成立了“救济西藏人委员会”。
