Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, May 23rd: According to TASS, the Geneva Foreign Ministers Conference held its tenth meeting on the 22nd, chaired by Gromyko. Herter spoke first.

The U.S. Secretary of State said he wanted to talk again about the security provisions in the Western "Peace Plan." He said he was doing so because the Soviet Foreign Minister seemed to have said in his speech that raising specific security issues at this meeting "would create obstacles." Although, in fact, the Soviet delegation has already stated its willingness to study any reasonable proposals to consolidate European security separately, according to appropriate procedures, including some proposals in the Western plan, the Soviet delegation opposes linking European security issues with the German issue.

Herter described the part of the Western "package deal" related to guaranteeing security. He compared this plan with the Soviet draft peace treaty with Germany, insisting that the Western plan had its advantages because it stipulated that not only the production of chemical, bacteriological, and nuclear weapons should be prohibited in Germany, but also similar production should be prohibited in European countries in eastern Germany. In his view, the Soviet draft was limited to Germany. In this regard, Herter evaded the following important point: all the measures proposed in the Western plan to ensure security were merely for show, because according to this plan, these measures could only be implemented after the formation of an all-German government. It is well known that the Soviet delegation, in analyzing the Western "package deal," has already stated that the practice of bundling security issues with other complex issues only benefits those who actually seek to obstruct the implementation of all measures to consolidate security.

Herter was unable to put forward any strong reasons in his speech to refute the Soviet criticism of the Western countries' plan. He could only repeat the old tune that it seemed "difficult to obtain any guarantees for peace and European security" before Germany was reunified.

Then, Couve de Murville spoke. He followed Herter, touting the advantages of the Western "package." Like Herter, he also emphasized that no problem could be resolved until Germany was reunified according to the Western countries' plan. Couve de Murville did not mention the draft peace treaty with Germany, although only through the path of concluding a peace treaty could the German question be resolved and the issue of guaranteeing peace and European security be settled.

In a brief speech, Gromyko once again emphasized how much the Soviet government valued the issue of a peace treaty with Germany, which should be discussed at the current meeting based on the agreement between our governments.

Gromyko said that the Soviet delegation believes that discussing the specific issues of the treaty now could bring the greatest benefit. If we follow this path, we can most smoothly achieve the goal that we all seem to agree on, as long as we focus on the foundations that can unite us and bring our positions closer, rather than focusing on the differences between us. We see the benefit of this approach in that, when discussing the terms of the treaty, it may be possible to find some mutual understanding on issues broader than the content of these or those individual terms stipulated in the treaty.

Gromyko pointed out that during the previous meetings discussing the Soviet draft peace treaty with Germany, some delegations had unclear points about individual clauses of the draft. He said that the delegation of the Federal Republic of Germany had expressed concern, thinking that according to some clauses included in the Soviet treaty draft, the Federal Republic of Germany would have to withdraw from the economic alliances it currently participates in. We have already had the opportunity to explain that such a conclusion has no basis. In order to clarify this issue, the Soviet delegation proposed a concrete suggestion: to add a new clause to the draft treaty, the full text of the new clause is as follows: "This treaty does not affect the rights and obligations enjoyed and undertaken by Germany due to the participation of the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany in international economic alliances and organizations (including economic alliances and organizations established on a regional basis). The issue of whether a unified Germany will become a member of such alliances or organizations shall be decided by a qualified all-German body, and the Allied and Associated Powers shall recognize this decision."

Gromyko expressed his hope that the Soviet Union's negotiating partners would treat this suggestion with due objectivity.

At the end of the speech by the head of the Soviet delegation, Lloyd actually said that discussing these or those clauses of the draft treaty at present "would not be beneficial." He insisted that the various conditions for restoring German unification must be discussed first, and only after that could the treaty be studied. He believed that the treaty should be placed at "the end of this work process."

The meeting ended there. The participants agreed that the next meeting would be held on the 25th (Monday).

### 力求彼此立场的接近和互相谅解  苏联就对德和约草案提出新条款  西方外长竭力回避认真讨论和约草案

    力求彼此立场的接近和互相谅解
    苏联就对德和约草案提出新条款
    西方外长竭力回避认真讨论和约草案
    新华社23日讯　据塔斯社日内瓦讯：日内瓦外长会议22日举行第十次会议，由葛罗米柯担任主席。赫脱首先发言。
    美国国务卿说，他想再谈一谈西方的“和平计划”中有关安全问题的那些条款。他说他所以要这样做，是由于苏联外交部长在发言中似乎曾经说过，在这次会议上提出具体的安全问题“将会造成障碍”，虽然实际上，苏联代表团已经声明，愿意按照适当的程序分别地研究关于巩固欧洲安全的任何合理建议，其中也包括西方计划中的某些建议，但是苏联代表团反对把欧洲安全问题同德国问题纠缠在一起。
    赫脱叙述了西方“一揽子计划”中有关保证安全问题的部分。他将这个计划和苏联的对德和约草案作了一番比较，硬说西方计划有其优越性，因为这个计划中规定，不但禁止在德国进行化学武器、细菌武器和核武器的生产，而且也禁止在德国东部的欧洲国家进行同类的生产，而苏联草案，照他看来，只局限在德国。在这方面，赫脱回避了下列这一重要情况：西方计划中就保证安全问题所提出的一切措施完全是为了摆摆样子，因为按照这个计划，这些措施只有在全德政府组成后才能实现。大家知道，苏联代表团在分析西方的“一揽子计划”时已经说明，把安全问题同其他复杂的问题捆在一个“包裹”里的作法，只对实际上力图阻挠实现巩固安全的一切措施的人有利。
  赫脱在发言中没有能够提出任何有力的理由，来反驳苏联对西方国家计划的批评。他只能重弹老调说，在德国重新统一以前，似乎“很难获得任何对和平和欧洲安全的保证”。
    然后，德姆维尔发言。他追随赫脱，吹嘘西方“一揽子”的优点。像赫脱一样，他也强调说，当德国还没有根据西方国家的计划重新统一之前，任何一个问题也不可能获得解决。德姆维尔只字不提关于对德和约草案问题，虽然只有通过缔结和约的道路，才能解决德国问题和解决保证和平和欧洲安全问题。
    葛罗米柯在简短的发言中再一次强调指出，苏联政府是多么重视对德和约问题，这一问题应当根据我们各国政府之间的协议在现在的会议上进行讨论。
    葛罗米柯说，苏联代表团认为，现在讨论有关和约的具体问题能够带来最大的好处。如果我们走这条道路，那么，只要我们把注意力集中于能使我们一致和使我们的立场接近的基础，而不是集中于使我们分歧的地方，就能够最顺利地达到看来我们大家都同意的目标。我们看到这种途径的好处在于，在讨论和约条款时，可能在比和约所规定的这些或那些个别条款的内容更广泛的问题上，找出某种互相谅解。
    葛罗米柯指出上几次会议讨论苏联对德和约草案时，某些代表团对这个草案个别条款有不明确的地方。他说，德意志联邦共和国代表团曾经表示担心，以为根据苏联和约草案包括的某些条款，德意志联邦共和国就得退出目前它所参加的那些经济联盟。我们已经有机会作了解释，这样的结论是没有任何基础的。为了澄清这个问题，苏联代表团提出具体的建议：在和约草案中再加上一条，新条款的全文如下：“本条约不触及德国由于德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国参加国际性的经济联盟和组织（其中包括建立在区域性基础上的经济联盟和组织）而享有的权利和承担的义务。关于统一的德国是否成为这种联盟或组织的成员问题，应由有资格的全德机构决定，而同盟和联合国家方面应当承认这种决定。”
    葛罗米柯表示，希望苏联的谈判伙伴以应有的客观态度对待这个建议。
    在苏联代表团团长发言结束的时候，劳埃德竟说，在目前讨论和约草案的这些或那些条款“不会有好处”。他硬说，首先必须讨论恢复德国统一的各种条件，只有在这以后才能研究和约。他认为，和约应列在“这个工作过程的末尾”。
    会议到此结束。与会者商定，下次会议在25日（星期一）举行。
