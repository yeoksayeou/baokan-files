    The distant mountains are shrouded in morning mist, and the nearby mountains are lush green. The bus, "rumbling," bathed in the morning glow, left the small station where it had rested overnight. The old woman sitting next to me glanced at the scenery outside the window with reluctance, sighed deeply, and a displeased expression appeared on her face. I hurriedly asked, "Auntie, are you not feeling well?" She shook her head and smiled: "Comrade, no. I was reminded of a sad thing."
    Then, she told me: Twelve years ago, she and her baby, who was only a few months old, were rudely pushed off the train by fellow passengers. Because her child had a slight fever, the people on the train insisted it was an infectious disease. As a result, her son died of cold and illness at this small station where there were no doctors or medicine…
    "Oh dear, burning up!" A young mother's exclamation behind me interrupted our conversation. The child, about two years old, in her arms was sleeping, his little face as red as a ripe apple. Suddenly, the child convulsed, immediately foaming at the mouth and limbs twitching. The inexperienced mother was stunned, at a loss, anxiously calling the child's name and shedding tears. "Don't worry!" the old woman comforted, and then asked the entire carriage: "Is there a doctor?" Before she finished speaking, a Dai girl, who was buried in a book, took off her tortoiseshell glasses and stood up from her seat: "I just graduated from medical school, Auntie, what's the matter?"
    The bus stopped in a valley. Everyone curiously craned their necks to watch the Dai girl examine the child. "But there's no medicine," the girl spread her hands helplessly. "What to do then?" the mother cried softly again. At this moment, an old man with gray hair squeezed over from the back, carefully took out a box of injections from his arms: "Look, can this be used?" The girl was so happy she almost jumped up: "Great, this is exactly what I need!" The old man smiled, revealing his missing teeth: "My little grandson often gets this kind of illness, so I brought some with me when I went to Kunming for the conference..." "But we still need a syringe." After the girl reminded me, I remembered the syringe I bought for the clinic and quickly said, "I have one!" The driver also jumped up from his seat and brought over a bottle: "This is alcohol!"
    The Dai girl gave the child an injection, and soon the child cried loudly. Everyone breathed a deep sigh of relief, and their hearts that had been in their throats fell back into place. The child cried loudly, and no one could soothe him. A major took out a cloth-made teddy bear from his briefcase: "Don't cry, here, play with this!" The mother was about to refuse when the driver took off the cotton coat he was wearing: "He might be cold, here, cover him." He put the cotton coat on the child without allowing any argument.
    The bus started again. The child lay in the coat, playing with the cloth teddy bear, and said to his mother, "Mom, I want to go home!" "Home? Isn't this home!" I clearly saw bright tears flashing in her eyes when she said this.
    It was raining outside, and I reached out my hand and felt a little cold. The carriage was warm, as if a hot fire was burning.

    家
    白族　那家伦
    远山晨雾蒙胧，近山一片葱翠。客车“轰轰”响着，浴着早霞，离开这停歇了一夜的途中小站。坐在我身旁的老大妈，留恋地朝窗外望了一眼，深沉地叹了一口气，脸上露出不悦的神色。我急忙问：“大妈，您不舒服？”她摇摇头笑了笑：“同志，不是。我是想起了一件伤心事。”
    于是，她告诉我：十二年前，她和怀抱中才几个月的孩子，被粗暴的同车旅客推了下来。因为她的孩子有些发烧，同车的人硬说是传染病。于是儿子就连冻带病死在这个没有医生和医药的小站上了……
    “啊哟，烧得厉害！”身后一个年轻母亲的惊叫，打断了我们的谈话。她怀里那个约有两岁的小孩在昏睡着，小脸烧得像熟透了的苹果一样。小孩突然痉癴了一下，立刻嘴冒白沫，四肢抽搐起来。没有经验的母亲吓呆了，不知所措，焦急地呼唤着小孩的名字，并落下泪来。“别急！”大娘安慰一声，随即向全车厢问道：“有医生没有？”话未落音，一个埋头看书的傣族姑娘摘掉玳瑁眼镜，从座位上站起来：“我是刚从医校毕业出来的，大妈，什么事？”
    车在一个山谷中停下来了。大家都关切地伸长脖子注意傣族姑娘给小孩检查。“可是没药”姑娘无奈地摊开两手。“那怎么办呢？”母亲又低声哭起来。这时，一个头发斑白的老人从后面挤过来，很小心地从怀里掏出一盒针药：“你看，这用得上吗？”姑娘高兴得差点跳起来：“太好了，我正是要这个！”老人笑得张开了缺牙的嘴巴：“我那小孙孙也常害这种病，这次上昆明开代表会顺便带了点……”“可是还差注射器。”经姑娘这么一提醒，我才想起给卫生所买的注射器，忙说：“我有！”驾驶员也一下从座位上跳起来，送过来一个瓶子：“这是酒精！”
    傣族姑娘给小孩打了针，不一会小孩就大声哭起来。大家都深深地吐了一口气，提着的心落了下来。小孩大声哭着，谁也哄不住。一个少校从手提包里取出一个布做的小熊：“别哭了，来，玩这个吧！”母亲正想拒绝，驾驶员又脱下了披在身上的棉衣：“可能是冷了，来，给他盖上。”他不容分说地把棉衣盖在小孩身上。
    车又开动了。小孩躺在大衣里，玩着布做的小熊，对妈妈说：“妈，我要回家！”“家？这不就是家吗！”我清清楚楚地看到，她说这话时，眼里闪烁着亮晶晶的泪花。
    外面下雨了，我伸出手去，感觉有些寒冷。车厢里却是暖暖的，仿佛烧着一盆热烘烘的火。
