Nanchang Dispatch from our Newspaper, May 25th: In the main wheat-producing areas of Jiangxi, such as Yichun, Shangrao, and Jiujiang prefectures, cadres and the masses are bravely rushing to harvest wheat in the rain.

The total area of wheat and barley to be harvested in these prefectures reaches two million mu. Except for the 300,000 mu of barley and early-maturing wheat in southern Jiangxi that has already been harvested and stored, the remaining 1.7 million mu of unharvested wheat was hit by continuous strong winds and heavy rain for more than ten days in mid-May. In order to prevent some of the lodged wheat from molding and sprouting, all prefectures immediately mobilized the masses and took various measures to rush the harvest. In Yichun Prefecture, government officials, students, and residents of Yichun City participated in the rush harvest work of the local people's communes after the mature wheat was hit by the wind and rain. At the same time, all counties and people's communes in the entire prefecture also dispatched a large number of cadres to go deep into the fields to participate in and lead the rush harvest. Nearly 200,000 people in the entire region, braving the rain and working hard, have already rushed to harvest 400,000 mu of wheat. While rushing to harvest wheat, all communes are also carrying out threshing, drying, and storage work.

In Shangrao Prefecture, all counties adopted the method of harvesting river滩 first and lodged wheat first during the rush harvest. After six days of effort, 150,000 mu of wheat out of the total 300,000 mu in the region have been harvested.

In Jiujiang Prefecture, a rush harvest team of more than 50,000 people in Boyang County, under the slogan of "Declaring war on the sky and fighting for grain with the rain," also rushed to harvest more than 50,000 mu of wheat in five days. During the harvest, they also formed organizations for harvesting, threshing, transportation, and turning and drying according to the strength of the labor force and the level of technology, achieving the requirements of fast harvesting, clean threshing, and good management.

    不让到手的小麦霉烂发芽
    江西宜春等地冒雨抢收
    本报南昌25日电  江西主要产麦区的宜春、上饶、九江等专区，广大干部和群众正冒雨抢收小麦。
    这几个专区的大、小麦收获面积达二百万亩。除三十万亩大麦和赣南成熟较早的小麦已收完进仓外，其余未收割的一百七十万亩小麦，在5月中旬遭到了连续十余天狂风急雨的吹打。为使一些倒伏的小麦不致霉烂、发芽，各个专区都立即发动群众，采取各种措施抢收小麦。宜春专区的机关干部、学生和宜春县城的居民，在风雨袭击成熟的小麦后，都参加了当地人民公社的抢收工作。同时，全专区各个县和人民公社也都抽调了大批干部，分别深入到田间，参加抢收领导抢收。全区近二十万人的抢收队伍，冒雨苦战，已经抢了四十万亩小麦。各公社在抢收小麦的同时，还进行了打场凉晒和入仓的工作。
    上饶专区各县在抢收中都采取了河滩先收、倒伏先收的办法，经过六天的努力，全区三十万亩小麦，已抢收了十五万亩。
    九江专区波阳县五万多人的抢收队伍在“向天宣战、与雨争粮”的口号下，在五天时间中，也抢收了五万多亩小麦。他们在收割中还根据劳动力强弱，技术高低，组成收割、脱粒、运输、翻晒等组织，达到了收得快、打得净、管得好的要求。（附图片）
