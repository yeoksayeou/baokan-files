Such a "Package Deal"

The so-called "peace plan" proposed by Western countries at the Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference is generally referred to as a "package deal." This is an extremely complex and lengthy document. The entire plan is divided into four stages, comprising thirty-two clauses.

The preamble to the "plan" states: Western countries advocate concluding an agreement for the "comprehensive settlement of disputed issues," and "the measures considered are closely related to each other, and therefore, the current proposal should be regarded as an indivisible whole."

"Phase One" of the "plan" contains five clauses, focusing on the Berlin issue. It states, "Berlin is a single city, and it belongs to the whole of Germany. Therefore, East and West Berlin should be unified through free elections held under the supervision of the four powers or the United Nations." It advocates that the entire Berlin, before the reunification of Germany, should "freely" elect a "committee" to govern the city "freely" under the supreme authority of the four powers. It also states, "The freedom and integrity of the unified city of Berlin and its access routes will be guaranteed by the four powers, and the four powers will continue to have the right to station troops in Berlin as they do now."

The "plan" states that during this phase, "In order to further promote the resolution of political issues and the improvement of international relations, the four powers will, when appropriate, begin discussions on possible phased and supervised broad disarmament measures."

"The four powers will arrange discussions to formulate procedures for exchanging information on military forces in agreed areas of Europe in the second phase."

"Phase Two" of the "plan" is the so-called "transitional phase" for German "reunification." It includes thirteen clauses.

It states: "In view of the complex issues involved in the unification work, a transitional period will be agreed upon. The four powers will establish a mixed German committee." "This mixed commission will consist of twenty-five members from the Federal Republic of Germany and ten members from the so-called ' German Democatic Republic.'" "The mixed committee will make decisions by a three-quarters majority." "The mixed committee will be entrusted with the task of drafting the following recommendations: A. Coordinate and expand technical contacts between the two parts of Germany; B. Ensure the free flow of individuals, ideas, and publications between the two parts of Germany; C. Guarantee and protect human rights in the two parts of Germany; D. Draft a draft law providing for comprehensive, free, and secret elections under independent supervision." This election law "will be submitted to a referendum in the two parts of Germany."

The "plan" states, "If any recommendation regarding the election law obtains a majority of valid votes in each of the two parts of Germany, then it will have legal force and will be directly applicable to the entire election area." "If nationwide elections have not been held before the expiration of the thirty-month period calculated from the date of signing the agreement, the four powers will decide on the arrangements for the committee."

The "plan" mentions that in this situation, "the four powers will limit or reduce their armed forces to agreed maximum levels, for example, 2.5 million for the United States and 2.5 million for the Soviet Union." During the same period, these countries will, under the supervision of an international supervisory organization, store a specific number of designated types of weapons to be jointly agreed upon in warehouses on their own territories.

The "plan" states that the four powers are prepared to negotiate further limitations on their armed forces and armaments, which will come into effect in the third phase, but on the condition that:

	A. Verification that the above-mentioned disarmament provisions have been complied with; B. Other major countries agree to accept limitations on their armed forces and armaments that are determined in accordance with the limitations on the armed forces and armaments of the four powers; C. Establish an inspection and supervision system to verify that all agreed security measures are complied with.

The "plan" requires that during this phase, "inspection and observation measures to prevent surprise attacks can be taken in all geographical areas of the world," requires making appropriate arrangements for abandoning the production of chemical weapons, biological weapons, and nuclear weapons in the German Democratic Republic and Eastern European socialist countries, because, according to it, West Germany has already abandoned the production of these weapons in 1954, and requires "formulating an inspection system to ensure that the appropriate security measures stipulated in the third phase are complied with."

"Phase Three" of the "plan" is the implementation phase of "reunification" and also includes thirteen clauses.

It stipulates that within two and a half years after the signing of the agreement on the election law, elections will be held in the two parts of Germany to elect a pan-German parliament.

The "plan" stipulates that this pan-German parliament will have the task of drafting a pan-German constitution, a pan-German government will be established, and "a pan-German peace treaty will be negotiated as soon as possible" after the establishment of the pan-German government.

The "plan" states that before the conclusion of a peace treaty with the pan-German government, the four powers will "retain their rights and responsibilities related to Berlin and the whole of Germany."

The "plan" also stipulates that a common area should be determined in Europe, stipulating the maximum limits for Eastern and Western troops, but on the condition that "an effective supervision and inspection system to ensure inspection work is established."

Then it says that after the peace treaty is concluded, all foreign troops will withdraw from Germany, "and no troops will be sent to that country again without the consent of that country's government."

The "plan" stipulates that a pan-German government can decide to participate in "any security treaty," and if this happens, additional security arrangements will be considered.

The "plan" states that if the limitations and conditions on armed forces and armaments stipulated for the second phase are achieved, the four powers will further limit their armed forces to agreed maximum levels, for example, 2.1 million for the United States and 2.1 million for the Soviet Union. The armed forces and armaments of other major countries will be reduced to agreed levels at the same time.

After verifying that the above-mentioned restrictions have been complied with, further restrictions (e.g., 1.7 million for the United States; 1.7 million for the Soviet Union) and corresponding armament reductions will be negotiated again, and the levels of armed forces and armaments of other major countries will be specifically stipulated through their negotiations at the same time.

The "plan" believes that the measures specified above will be coordinated with the overall disarmament plan so that they are included within the overall scope. As long as the supervisory system can be implemented and is effective, "all security measures of the phased plan will remain in effect."

"Phase Four" of the "plan" states, "Since a final peace arrangement can only be made with a government that does not represent all of Germany, such arrangements should be made in this phase: All United Nations member states at war with Germany can sign the arrangements. This arrangement shall take effect upon ratification by the four powers and Germany."

### 如此“一揽子计划”

    如此“一揽子计划”
    西方国家在日内瓦外长会议上提出的所谓“和平计划”，一般都称作“一揽子计划”。这是个极其复杂而冗长的文件。整个计划内容分为四个阶段，包括三十二个条款。
    “计划”的序言说：西方国家主张缔结一项“全面解决有争执的问题”的协定，“所考虑的措施相互之间是密切有关的，因此，应认为目前的建议是不可分割的整体”。
    “计划”的“第一阶段”包含五个条款，着重谈论了柏林问题。它说，“柏林是一个单一的城市，它属于整个德国。因此，东西柏林应该通过在四国或者联合国监督下举行的自由选举实现统一。”它主张整个柏林在德国重新统一以前，“自由地”选出“委员会”，在四国的最高权力之下，“自由地”治理这个城市。它还说，“统一的柏林市的自由和完整以及通道将由四国加以保证，四国将继续像目前那样有权在柏林驻扎军队。”
    “计划”说，在这个阶段内，“为了进一步促进政治问题的解决和国际关系的改善，四国将在适当的场合，开始讨论可能的分阶段的和受到监督的广泛的裁军措施。”
  “四国将安排讨论，来拟订在第二阶段就欧洲商定地区的军事部队交换情报的手续。”
    “计划”的“第二阶段”是德国“重新统一”的所谓“过渡阶段”。它包括十三个条款。
    它说：“鉴于统一工作中牵涉到的复杂问题，将商定一个过渡时期。四国将设立一个混合的德国委员会。”“这个混合委员会将由德意志联邦共和国的二十五名委员和所谓‘德意志民主共和国’的十名委员组成。”“混合委员会将以四分之三的多数作出决定。”“混合委员会将受托进行拟订下列建议的工作：甲、协调和扩大德国两部分之间的技术接触；乙、保证德国两部分之间的个人、思想和刊物的自由流通；丙、保证和保障德国两部分的人权；丁、草拟一项规定在独立的监督下进行全面的、自由的秘密选举的法律草案。”这个选举法“将交由德国的两个部分进行公民投票。”
    “计划”说，“关于选举法的任何一个建议如果在德国的两个部分分别获得多数的有效票，那末，它将具有法律力量，并将直接适用于整个选举地区。”“如果在自协议签字日开始计算的三十个月的规定期限届满以前尚未举行全德选举，那末，四国将决定对委员会的安排。”
    “计划”谈到在这种情况下，“四国将把它们的武装部队限制在或者减少到商定的最大限度内，例如，美国为二百五十万人，苏联为二百五十万人。”在同一时期内，这些国家将在一个国际监督组织的监督下，把将要共同商定的具体数量的指定类型的武器存放在它们本国领土上的仓库中。
    “计划”说，四国准备谈判进一步限制它们武装部队和军备，这种限制将在第三阶段生效，但生效的条件是：
    甲、证实上述关于裁军的规定已经得到遵守；乙、其他主要国家同意接受按照四国的武装部队和军备的限制而确定的对它们的武装部队和军备的限制；丙、建立一个视察和监督制度来证实一切商定的安全措施得到遵守。
    “计划”要求在这个阶段内“可以在全世界的各地理区域采取防止突然袭击的视察和观察措施”，要求作出为取得在德意志民主共和国和东欧社会主义国家实行放弃生产化学武器、生物武器和原子核武器的适宜的安排，因为据它说，西德已经在1954年放弃生产这些武器，并且要求“拟订视察制度，以保证规定在第三阶段实行的合适的安全措施得到遵守”。
    “计划”的“第三阶段”是“重新统一”的实施阶段，也包括有十三个条款。
    它规定在有关选举法的协议签字以后两年半内，在德国两部分举行选出全德议会的选举。
    “计划”规定这个全德议会将有起草全德宪法的任务，将成立一个全德政府，并且在全德政府成立以后“尽速谈判一项全德和约”。
    “计划”说，在同全德政府签订和约以前，四国将“保留它们的那些同柏林和整个德国有关的权利和责任”。
    这个“计划”还规定共同在欧洲确定一个地区，规定东西方军队的最高限额，但条件是要“建立保证进行检查工作的有效的监督和视察制度”。
    然后它说，在和约缔结后，一切外国军队撤出德国，“非经该国政府的同意，不再派军队到那个国家去”。
    “计划”规定，一个全德政府可以决定参加“任何安全条约”，在发生这种情况时，将考虑作另外的安全安排。
    “计划”说，如果为第二阶段规定的武装部队和军备的限制和条件实现的话，四国将进一步把他们的武装部队限制在商定的最高水平，例如美国二百十万人；苏联二百十万人。其他主要国家的武装部队和军备将同时削减到商定的水平。
    而在查明上述限制得到遵守以后，将再谈判进一步限制（例如美国一百七十万人；苏联一百七十万人）以及相应的军备裁减，其他主要国家的武装部队和军备的水平将在同时通过它们的谈判具体规定。
    “计划”认为，上面规定的措施将同总的裁军计划协调，以便包括在总的范畴以内。只要监督制度能够执行并且有效，“分阶段计划的一切安全措施将继续有效”。
    “计划”的“第四阶段”说，“由于只能同不代表全德的政府进行最后的和平安排，所以应该在这个阶段进行这样的安排：所有对德交战的联合国会员国都可以在安排上签字。这种安排于四国和德国批准后即予生效。”
