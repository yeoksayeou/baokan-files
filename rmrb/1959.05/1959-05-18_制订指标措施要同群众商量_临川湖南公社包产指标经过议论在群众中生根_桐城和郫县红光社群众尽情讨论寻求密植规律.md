    Discussing Indicators and Measures with the Masses
    Production Quotas Take Root in Hunan Commune, Linchuan County, Through Discussion
    Masses in Tongcheng and Hongguang Commune, Pixian County, Fully Discuss and Seek Laws of Close Planting

    (Our dispatch from Nanchang, May 17th) The Hunan People's Commune in Linchuan County, Jiangxi Province, fully mobilized the masses to discuss and revise production quotas, so that the quotas were set both positively and reliably, with room for over-production, thereby truly taking root among the masses.

    The Hunan Commune recently launched a democratic discussion on production quotas, based on production teams. The principles of the discussion were: First, the actual output of last year was used as the basis and foundation for this year's production quota. Second, the experiences and lessons of last year's production were summarized to identify this year's conditions and measures for increasing production. Finally, the fields were divided into plots and grades to determine the planned output of each production team this year, and a production quota of about 10% to 15% lower than the planned output was set, so that each production team could exceed it through effort and receive a reward. As a result, from cadres to the masses, everyone felt that they were truly "carrying a thousand-jin load with the strength of ten thousand people," and they were very serious about everything. For example, the Chunguang Brigade achieved an average rice yield of 880 jin per mu last year through intensive cultivation, an unprecedented harvest. The original plan for this year's grain production quota was to double it again. During this discussion, the majority of commune members believed that last year's output had already almost doubled, and although the potential for increased production this year was still great, doubling it again would be difficult. In addition, a small number of commune members still held the idea that production had reached its peak, and advocated using last year's actual output as this year's production quota. Therefore, people engaged in a heated debate about whether production could be increased this year, and by how much. As a result of the debate, each production team affirmed the following main conditions and measures for increasing production: First, some remote and poor fields were insufficiently fertilized last year, while this year the fertilizer accumulated and applied is generally more than last year, and it can still be continuously accumulated and made, so as to strive for more balanced production increase. Second, last year's close planting was not always reasonable, and this year's implementation of reasonable close planting can further increase the yield per rice plant. Third, field management will be further strengthened to ensure that all seedlings are no worse than category three this year. Fourth, careful harvesting and threshing to avoid waste. Based on this, the common opinion of most commune members in each production team was that a further increase of 40% to 50% per mu this year compared to last year was reliable and would not result in a loss. On the basis of full discussion, each production team selected experienced veteran farmers to work with cadres to go deep into the fields to evaluate the land, divide it into plots, classify it, and determine output. Finally, the production targets and production quotas for this year were determined separately, with the production quotas being slightly lower than the production targets. In this way, the commune members were very satisfied. (Ma Zhongming, Wu Gangjian)

    (Our dispatch from Hefei, May 17th) In order to strive for a greater bumper harvest of early rice this year, Tongcheng County mobilized the masses to summarize last year's experience in close planting and further implemented rational close planting in light of local conditions.

    As early as before the early rice seedlings were raised, Tongcheng County held cadre meetings and commune member meetings at all levels of districts, townships, and communes to summarize last year's close planting experience through recollection and accounting, and to study how to further rationalize close planting this year. In the summary, the vast majority of cadres and commune members realized that the large-scale bumper harvest of early rice last year was largely due to the implementation of rational close planting. Last year, 98% of the early rice was planted in three-by-six-inch specifications, and the close planting was reasonable, resulting in bumper harvests in every plot and every team. Last year, some of the late rice was planted in one-by-one-inch, two-by-two-inch, one-by-three-inch, or two-by-four-inch specifications. Because it was planted too densely, the yield was not high. The stark contrast gave many commune members a profound education. They said, "We must plant densely, but the density must be rational." In the summary discussion, some people only saw the examples of improper close planting that led to reduced production last year, and therefore thought that close planting was not good and disagreed with continuing close planting this year; some people thought that close planting was too labor-intensive and fertilizer-intensive, and requested that close planting not be done too much this year; and a few people only saw the achievements and advocated that the denser the better, hoping to plant even denser this year. In light of these situations, the focus of the summaries and discussions in various places was on criticizing those conservative ideas that did not approve of close planting, and also on criticizing those unrealistic ideas that thought the denser the better.

    On the basis of full discussion and unified understanding, the Tongcheng County Party Committee, based on the conditions in various places and absorbing last year's close planting experience, decided to implement rational close planting in light of local conditions this year. The density of most of the county's 450,000 mu of early rice and 400,000 mu of late rice will be in the three-by-six-inch specifications, which have been proven by various places last year to have the highest and most reliable yield. Now all 450,000 mu of early rice in the county have been basically planted, of which three-by-six-inch close planting accounts for more than 90%, and two-by-five-inch and three-by-five-inch close planting accounts for nearly 20,000 mu. At present, the people's communes in various parts of the county have shifted to field management, and the communes and production teams have also formulated specific management methods based on local conditions.

    (Our dispatch from Chengdu, May 15th) The Second Farming Zone of the Hongguang People's Commune in Pixian County, Sichuan Province, discussed the issue of close planting of rice by organizing all commune members to explore experiences and find laws. After discussion, they have formulated various close planting specifications according to soil fertility and planting sequence.

    Everyone acknowledges that close planting of rice is better than "sparse big clumps," but how dense or sparse should it be to be just right and ensure increased production? People had different opinions. To this end, the Hongguang Commune's Second Farming Zone Party Branch adopted a method of democratic discussion, bringing together experienced veteran farmers from each team, young people who were willing to accept advanced technology, and general middle-aged farmers, allowing them to express their own opinions and discuss freely.

    During the discussion, everyone agreed that rational close planting should be carried out according to the soil characteristics of each plot and in light of local conditions. Veteran farmer Liu Haizhou said: Farming depends on the weather, the land, and the effort. Last year, the same soil, with 30,000 clumps per mu in close planting, had a good harvest, but planting according to the "starry sky" method of 100,000 clumps resulted in reduced yield. He believes that this year we should still maintain the close planting specification of 30,000 clumps. Some young farmers agreed with Liu Haizhou's statement that over-density is not good. However, they believe that we should see the improvement of conditions such as fertilizer, pest control, and technology this year, and that it can still be denser than last year. As a result of the discussion, everyone agreed to combine old experiences with new technologies, and to rank the fields and specifically plan the rational close planting specifications for each plot.

    Through detailed surveys by the masses, they divided the 9,600-plus mu of cultivated land in the entire farming zone into five types: oily sandy soil, mud soil, two-mud soil, cold-soaked soil, and waterlogged soil. Then, according to the instructions of the Provincial Party Committee, combined with the local specific conditions, close planting was carried out. For example, oily sandy soil is the most fertile and has thermal properties, and the seedlings are willing to tiller when planted, so it is appropriate to plant sparsely. They adopted a close planting specification of three-by-six, three-by-seven, and more than 30,000 clumps per mu. For cold-soaked fields, where the soil is relatively cold-soaked and the soil is only soft after weeding twice, the seedlings are not easy to tiller, and they can be planted more densely. Accordingly, they adopted a double-row strip planting specification of three-by-seven, planting about 45,000 clumps per mu. In order to avoid the phenomenon of taking care of one thing and losing sight of another, this farming zone has made reasonable arrangements for seeds, fertilizers, pest and disease control, planting season, etc., which are related to close planting.

    制订指标措施要同群众商量
    临川湖南公社包产指标经过议论在群众中生根
    桐城和郫县红光社群众尽情讨论寻求密植规律
    本报南昌17日电　江西省临川县湖南人民公社充分发动群众讨论和修订包产指标，使包产指标定得既积极可靠，又有超产余地，从而真正在群众中落脚生根。
    湖南公社最近以生产队为单位就包产问题开展了一次民主讨论。讨论的原则是：第一，以去年的实际产量做为今年包产的基础和依据。第二，总结去年生产的经验教训，摸清今年的增产条件和措施。最后，把田亩划片分等，确定今年各生产队的计划产量，并以低于计划产量的10％到15％左右作为包产产量，以使各生产队经过努力以后可以超过、有奖可得。由于这样，从干部到群众都感到真正是“千斤担子万人挑了”，事事都非常认真。如春光大队去年由于精耕细作稻谷平均每亩产量达到了八百八十斤，是历年来未有的丰收。今年原订粮食包产指标要求再翻一番。在这次讨论时，大多数社员认为，去年产量已经快翻了一番，今年增产潜力虽然还很大，但要再翻一番有困难。另外少数社员还存在着增产到顶的思想，主张仍以去年的实际产量作今年的包产指标。因此，人们对今年能不能增产、能增产多少，展开了热烈争论。争论的结果，各生产队都肯定了以下几个主要增产条件和措施：一、去年有部分远田瘦田施肥不足，而今年的肥料普遍比去年积得多施得多，并且现在还可以继续积肥造肥，从而能争取更加平衡地增产。二、去年密植有的不够合理，今年推行了合理密植，可以进一步提高水稻单株产量。三、进一步加强田间管理，争取今年全部不出三类苗。四、细收细打，避免浪费。据此，各生产队大多数社员的共同意见：今年比去年每亩再增产40％—50％是可靠的，不会赔产。在充分讨论的基础上，各生产队又选出有经验的老农协同干部一起深入田间，对田亩进行评比，划片分等定产。最后分别确定了今年的生产指标和包产指标，包产指标比生产指标稍低。这样，社员都非常满意。（马钟明、吴刚健）
    本报合肥17日电　为了争取今年早稻更大丰收，桐城县发动群众总结了去年密植的经验，进一步因地制宜实行合理密植。
    早在早稻育秧以前，桐城县就在各区、乡、社层层召开干部会议、社员会议，用回忆、算账的办法总结去年密植经验，研究今年如何进一步合理密植。在总结中绝大部分干部和社员都认识到，去年早稻获得大面积丰收，实行合理密植是重要原因之一。去年早稻98％是插三乘六寸的规格，密植得合理，因而达到块块丰收，队队丰收。去年晚稻中有少数田插的是一乘一寸、二乘二寸、一乘三寸、或二乘四寸，由于插得太密，产量就不高。鲜明的对比，使很多社员得到深刻的教育，他们说：“一定要密植，但是密植一定要合理。”在总结讨论中，有些人只片面地看到去年少数密植不当，因而减产的事例，就认为密植不好，不同意今年再搞密植；有些人认为密植太费工、太费肥，要求今年密植不能搞得太多；也有少数人只片面地看到成绩一面，主张越密越好，希望今年再密一点。根据这些情况，各地在总结和讨论中着重批判了那些不赞成密植的保守思想，同时也批判了那些认为越密越好的不切实际的想法。
    在充分讨论、统一认识的基础上，桐城县委根据各地情况，吸收去年密植经验，决定今年因地制宜地实行合理密植。全县四十五万亩早稻和四十万亩晚稻的密度，大部分实行经去年各地证实了的产量最高、最可靠的三乘六寸的规格。现在全县四十五万亩早稻已基本插完，其中三乘六寸密植占90％以上，二乘五寸和三乘五寸密植将近两万亩。目前全县各地人民公社已转入田间管理，各公社和生产队还根据本地情况订出了具体的管理办法。
    本报成都15日电　四川郫县红光人民公社第二耕作区，用组织全体社员摸经验、找规律的方法，讨论水稻密植问题。经过讨论，他们已按照土壤肥瘦，栽插先后，订出各种不同的密植规格。
    人们都承认水稻密植比“稀大窝”好，但是，到底应该多密多稀才算恰到好处，保证增产呢？大家的说法不一。为此，红光公社第二耕作区党支部采取了民主讨论的方法，把各队有经验的老农，和勇于接受先进技术的青年，以及一般中年农民，组织在一起，让他们各舒己见，尽情讨论。
    讨论时，大家都认为应该根据每块地的土壤特性，因地制宜地进行合理密植。老农刘海洲说：种庄稼要看天、看地、看工夫，去年同样的土，每亩密植三万窝的，收成很好，可是按“满天星”十万窝的栽法，就减收。他认为今年仍旧应该保持三万窝的密植规格。一些青年农民同意了刘海洲的过密不好的说法。但是，认为应该看到今年肥料、除虫、技术等条件的改善，还是可以比去年再密一些。讨论的结果，大家都同意要把老经验和新技术结合起来，并且把田亩排队，具体规划出每块田亩的合理密植规格。
    通过群众的详细调查，他们把全耕作区的九千六百多亩耕地，分作五种类型，即油沙田、泥田、二泥田、冷浸田、下湿田。然后根据省委的指示，结合当地具体条件进行密植。例如，油沙田土壤最肥，具有热性，秧子栽下去肯发兜，因此宜栽稀些，他们采取了三乘六、三乘七、每亩三万窝以上的密植规格。土壤比较冷浸，要薅过二道秧泥土才软的冷浸田，秧子不大容易发兜，可以栽密些。据此，他们采用了三乘七的双行条栽规格，每亩栽四万五千窝左右。为了不发生顾此失彼的现象，这个耕作区对和密植有关的种子、肥料、防治病虫害、栽种季节等，都合理地进行了安排。
