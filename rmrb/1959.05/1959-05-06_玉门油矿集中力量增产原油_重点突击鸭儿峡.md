Yumen Oilfield Concentrates Efforts to Increase Crude Oil Production
　　Focuses on Ya'erxia

　　(Our report) Since entering the decisive second quarter, Yumen Oilfield has adopted the working method of shortening the battle line, concentrating forces, and ensuring key points, so that the ongoing "three highs" competition movement of high production, high quality, and high efficiency is gradually deepening.

　　In order to ensure a decisive victory in the second quarter's production, Yumen Oilfield first adopted the leadership method of "shortening the battle line, concentrating forces, ensuring key points, and fighting annihilation battles." Accelerating the development of the Ya'erxia new oilfield is the most important of the key points in Yumen Oilfield's production and construction this year; the crude oil planned to be produced by this new oilfield accounts for about 40% of the total crude oil production of the entire oilfield. In order to complete all the new oil wells planned to be drilled in this oilfield in the second quarter and quickly put them into production, the entire oilfield transferred a large number of drilling forces from the new exploration areas in the Turpan, Chaosui, and Jiuquan basins to participate in the production and construction of Ya'erxia. Secondly, under the slogan of "competing for every second, not giving up every ounce, increasing production every day, and exceeding quotas every month," a large-scale mass movement was launched, and a great effort was made in technical revolution and technical innovation. To this end, the entire oilfield held a mobilization rally, calling on workers to launch a technical innovation upsurge. The drilling teams in the Ya'erxia area, in addition to continuing to promote the rapid drilling method, have begun to promote the three advanced experiences of clear water drilling, small borehole drilling, and rotary mixed drilling, so as to increase the drilling speed by 25% to 35%.

　　After Yumen Oilfield adopted the above-mentioned practices, a brand-new situation has emerged in the oilfield's production and construction. The drilling footage plan for the second quarter of the entire oilfield has increased by nearly one time compared with the first quarter. (Attached picture)

　　玉门油矿集中力量增产原油
    重点突击鸭儿峡
    本报讯　玉门油矿进入决定性的二季度以来，采用缩短战线，集中力量，保证重点的工作方法，使目前正在进行的高产、高质、高效率“三高”竞赛运动逐步深入。
    玉门油矿为了确保二季度的生产取得决定性的胜利，首先采用了“缩短战线、集中力量、保证重点、打歼灭战”的领导方法。加速开发鸭儿峡新油田，是今年玉门油矿生产建设重点中的重点；这个新油田计划生产的原油，约占全矿原油生产总数的40％。为了在第二季度内，把这个油田计划钻凿的新油井全部钻完，并迅速使之投入生产，全矿从吐鲁番、潮水、酒泉等盆地的新探区上，抽调大批钻井力量，参加鸭儿峡的生产建设工作。其次，在“分秒必争、斤两不让、日日增产、月月超额”的口号下，大搞群众运动，大闹技术革命和技术革新。为此，全矿召开了誓师动员大会，号召职工掀起技术革新高潮。鸭儿峡地区的钻井队，除继续推广快速钻井法以外，已开始着手推广清水钻井、小井眼钻井、旋转混用钻井三大先进经验，使钻井速度提高25％到35％。
    玉门油矿采取上述做法后，全矿生产建设出现了崭新的局面。全矿二季度的钻井进尺计划比第一季度增加了近一倍。（附图片）
