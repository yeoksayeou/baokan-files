Sichuan Proposes Nine Measures

Chengdu, May 14 (From our newspaper) The entire party and all the people of Sichuan are urgently mobilized to engage in the battle for abundant harvests, meticulous harvesting, and returning every grain to the home.

The more than 43 million mu of summer-harvested crops in Sichuan, including wheat, rapeseed, broad beans, and peas, are nearing full ripeness.

To ensure abundant harvests, many places have started early to prepare for harvesting, threshing, transportation, rain protection, insect prevention, and storage equipment. To complete all the concentrated farm work faster and better, the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China issued a call to the people of the province in early May to launch a summer harvest and summer planting blitz month campaign. The members of the people's communes in various places, inspired by the summer harvest and motivated by the Provincial Party Committee's call for full harvesting and planting, quick harvesting and planting, and meticulous harvesting, have launched a vigorous battle for the crucial month of May. In order to concentrate labor on the front lines, Mianyang Prefecture alone has transferred 4 million laborers to rush harvesting and planting. To fully support the summer harvest and summer planting, Wenjiang Prefecture alone has drawn 200,000 people from commune-run industries and government organizations and urban residents to participate in the summer harvest. As a result, the speed of summer harvesting and summer planting has been greatly accelerated.

Based on a recent inspection of the summer harvest and summer planting situation, the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China held a telephone conference on the evening of the 11th to further deploy the summer harvest and summer planting work, and put forward the following measures:

	(1) Harvest in a timely manner, harvest one piece as it ripens, and plant one piece as it is harvested.
	(2) Harvest meticulously, clean-cut, thresh thoroughly, and store quickly, striving to return every grain to the home.
	(3) Select good seeds and reserve sufficient seed. Promote large-scale seed selection in high-yield fields to reserve 40 to 50 jin of wheat seeds per mu for next year.
	(4) While threshing and harvesting, verify the yield, weigh each batch as it is harvested, and establish a daily progress and yield report system in conjunction with work evaluation and point recording to prevent concealment of production and exaggeration.
	(5) Combine the summer harvest with patriotic education, actively deliver and sell grain, and seize the time to complete the state grain purchase tasks.
	(6) Establish a spirit of diligence and thrift. Promote saving food among urban and rural people to increase the reserves of the state, communes, and individual members.
	(7) Seize the opportunity to comprehensively complete the planting plan on time, with quality, and in quantity. Grasp both food crops and economic crops such as cotton and oilseeds; grasp both major crops and minor grains and local products.
	(8) Expanding the quantity of fertilizer accumulation and improving the quality of fertilizer are the most prominent issues in current agricultural production. Mobilize men, women, old and young to seize every possible moment to concentrate on accumulating and producing fertilizer. At the same time, pay commune members in cash on the same day they deliver fertilizer according to the reasonable price of the fertilizer.
	(9) Strengthen the leadership of summer harvesting and summer planting. The first secretary of the county party committee should fully lead agriculture, and the first secretary of the prefectural party committee should focus two-thirds of their energy on agriculture to ensure the completion of this year's agricultural production increase tasks.

    四川提出九项措施
    本报成都14日电　四川全党全民紧急动员投入丰产丰收、精打细收、颗粒还家的战斗。
    四川省四千三百多万亩小麦、油菜、葫豆、豌豆等夏收作物，已接近全面黄熟。
    为确保丰产丰收，许多地方都及早动手，对于收割、脱粒、运输、防雨、防虫和仓储设备进行了准备。为把各项集中一起的农活完成的更快更好，中共四川省委于5月初向全省人民发出开展夏收夏种突击运动月的号召。各地人民公社的社员，在夏季丰收鼓舞和省委关于全收全种、抢收抢种和精打细收的动员下，风起云涌的掀起了大战5月关键月的战斗。为把劳动力集中到第一线，仅绵阳专区就抽调了四百万劳动大军投入抢收抢种。为全力支援夏收、夏种，仅温江专区就从社办工业和机关团体、城镇居民中抽出二十万人投入夏收。因之，大大加快了夏收夏种的速度。
  根据最近对夏收夏种情况进行的检查，中共四川省委于11日晚召开电话会议，进一步布置夏收夏种工作，并提出以下措施：
    （1）适时收割，黄熟一块，割一块，收一块，种一块。
    （2）精打细收、割净打净收净，做到快打、快收、快藏，争取颗粒还家。
    （3）选好良种、留足种籽。推广在高产田成片选种，为明年留足每亩四十斤至五十斤的麦种。
    （4）边打边收，边核实产量，做到收一块，秤一块，结合评工记分，建立进度和产量日报表制度，防止瞒产和虚夸。
    （5）结合夏收进行爱国主义教育，踊跃缴粮售粮，抓紧时间完成国家征购任务。
    （6）树立勤俭风气。在城乡人民中提倡节约粮食，增加国家、公社、社员个人的储备。
    （7）抓紧时机，按时按质按量地全面完成栽播计划，既要抓粮食作物，又要抓棉花、油料等经济作物；既抓主要作物，又抓小杂粮、小土产。
    （8）扩大积肥数量，提高肥料质量是当前农业生产中最突出的问题。要动员男女老少利用一切可能的时间，突击积肥造肥。同时，按照肥料的合理价格，社员当天缴肥，即付现款。
    （9）加强夏收夏种领导，县委第一书记全力领导农业，地委第一书记以三分之二的精力侧重农业，以保证今年农业增产任务的完成。
