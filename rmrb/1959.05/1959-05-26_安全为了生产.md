Safety for Production

Safe production is an important principle for socialist enterprises in organizing production, and it is an important aspect of ensuring the healthy development of the increase production and practice economy movement. We must vigorously promote mass movements to increase production and improve quality, and at the same time pay attention to safety.

Some people say that either we don't engage in mass movements, or if mass movements rise, accidents are always difficult to avoid.

Are accidents really unavoidable? No. The examples of the Lü Fengqi bricklaying team having no accidents for eight years and the Yinchuan Power Plant boiler team having no accidents for three years, published in today's newspaper, are a strong proof. These two teams also went through the Great Leap Forward last year, and went through vigorous mass movements, and the Lü Fengqi team often worked at high altitudes, yet they still maintained safety.

Safety and production are unified. The purpose of safety is to eliminate obstacles to production, so that production can proceed smoothly.

Safety for production, regular safety production education, and constantly raising the vigilance of employees can prevent problems before they occur.

    安全为了生产
    安全生产，是社会主义企业组织生产的一条重要原则，是保证增产节约运动健康发展的一个重要方面。我们要大搞群众运动增加生产，提高质量，同时要注意安全。
    有人说，要嘛不搞群众运动，群众运动高涨起来了，事故总是难以避免的。
    事故是当真不可避免吗？不。今天本报发表的吕凤岐瓦工小组八年没有出事故，银川电厂锅炉小组三年没有出事故的例子，就是一个有力的证明。这两个小组同样经过了去年的大跃进，经过了大搞群众运动，而且吕凤岐小组还经常在高空作业，仍然做到安全。
    安全和生产是统一的。安全的目的在消除生产中不利于生产的障碍，以便顺利地进行生产。
    安全为了生产，经常进行安全生产的教育，时时刻刻提高职工们的警惕性，就可以防患于未然。
