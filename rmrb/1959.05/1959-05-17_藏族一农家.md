After the democratic reforms in the Ganzi Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture of Sichuan, the vast numbers of poor farmers and herdsmen liberated from the feudal serf system began to live free and happy lives. The family of Dengzhu Pengcuo in Waze Township, Kangding County, is one of the millions of Tibetan serf families liberated from the serf system. After his family was allocated land and livestock, they joined the agricultural producers' cooperative. All nine members of the family actively participated in various forms of labor in the cooperative. Last year, they received a total of 4,000 jin of grain from the cooperative, and began to live a life of plenty. His two youngest daughters have entered elementary school.
