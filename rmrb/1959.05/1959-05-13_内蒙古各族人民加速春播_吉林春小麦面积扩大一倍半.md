People of All Nationalities in Inner Mongolia Accelerate Spring Planting
Jilin Spring Wheat Area Expanded by Half Again

Our newspaper, Hohhot, 12th report – The spring planting campaign in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has fully entered its climax. Since around May 1st, across the vast fields from the Ergun River to the Xiliao River basin, and from the northern and southern slopes of the Yin Mountains to the Hetao Plain, various sowing machines have been busily working, and fertilizer transport vehicles have been running day and night. More than one million commune members of Mongolian, Han, Hui, Daur, Korean and other nationalities, active on the sowing front, are seizing the opportunity, accelerating the sowing speed, and striving to complete the spring sowing of 60 million mu of various crops in the region by mid-May.

In the first spring after the people's communes were established, the sowing work in Inner Mongolia has been earlier, faster, and better. The sowing period for wheat, oil crops, and coarse grains is generally about ten days earlier than in previous years. By May 3rd, a total of more than 24.7 million mu of various crops had been sown throughout the region, of which more than 7.94 million mu of spring wheat, sown first, already presented a scene of full and strong seedlings, and field management has fully begun. Oil crops are catching up rapidly, and more than 3.2 million mu have been planted in less than a month. While more than 12 million mu of field crops were being sown, communes in various places, running ahead of time, also planted more than 700,000 mu of sugar beets, soybeans and flax in just about twenty days. It is understood that the quality of this year's spring sowing is better than in any previous year. Nearly 8 million mu of wheat in the region are basically planted on land that has been autumn-plowed to a depth of half a foot or more, of which half of the wheat fields are basic fields that have been deep-plowed to about one foot, with a fertilization rate of more than 10,000 jin per mu. In Tuquan County, Hulunbuir League, where millet was mostly grown without fertilizer in the past, 3,000 jin of fertilizer per mu of millet land has now been applied, and rational close planting has been promoted, with seeds being wind-selected, screened, germination-tested, and disinfected with pesticides. Many people's communes have also selected and trained a large number of sowing technicians and launched activities to reform spring sowing tools, which has greatly improved the quality of sowing.

In the spring sowing campaign, leading cadres and staff members of various places in Inner Mongolia have gone deep into the countryside to participate in labor and lead production. The Ulanqab League Committee of the Communist Party of China adopted the method of having cadres at the league, banner (county, city), commune, management district and production team levels join forces in the fields to strengthen the leadership on the front lines of production, so that problems were discovered faster and resolved in a timely manner.

Our newspaper, Changchun, 12th report – Jilin Province has sown a total of more than 180,000 hectares of spring wheat this year, an increase of more than half compared with last year.

Jilin Province has always sown very little wheat. Since last winter, the Jilin Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China has paid special attention to mobilizing people's communes in various places to grow more wheat to meet the needs of the constantly growing living standards of the people. In March this year, a wave of early sowing and increased wheat planting was launched throughout the province, and sowing was completed by the end of April.

Most of this year's wheat in Jilin Province is planted on land that has been deep-plowed, and the base fertilizer is also sufficient. After several spring rains, the wheat seedlings have grown to three or four inches high and are green and strong. Now, the people's communes are carrying out spring sowing on the one hand and wheat field weeding on the other. In order to ensure a yield of 510 jin per mu of wheat, Fuyu County has universally established a special management system for wheat fields and field protection covenants in various communes to ensure timely weeding and fertilization. In the Baicheng area, which is known for its wind and sand, people's communes have also launched a wheat high-yield competition campaign, striving for stable and high wheat yields. (Cai Ming)

    内蒙古各族人民加速春播
    吉林春小麦面积扩大一倍半
    本报呼和浩特12日电  内蒙古自治区农村春播运动全面进入高潮。“五一”前后以来，从额尔古纳河到西辽河流域，从阴山两麓到河套平原的千里沃野上，各种播种机具穿梭不息，运肥车马日夜奔忙。活跃在播种战线上的一百多万蒙古、汉、回、达斡尔、朝鲜等民族社员，紧紧抓住时机，加快播种速度，力争在5月中旬完成全区六千万亩各种农作物的春播任务。
    在人民公社化后的第一个春天里，内蒙古播种工作显得又早、又快、又好。小麦、油料、杂粮的播种期，一般都比往年提早十天左右。到5月3日为止，全区播种完毕的各种作物共达二千四百七十多万亩，其中首先种上的七百九十四万多亩春小麦、已呈现苗全苗壮的景色，并已全面开始田间管理。油料作物急起直追，不到一个月也种上了三百二十多万亩。随着一千二百多万亩大田作物下种的同时，各地公社跑在时间前面，短短二十天左右又种上了七十多万亩甜菜、大豆和线麻。据了解今年春播质量比过去那一年都要好。全区将近八百万亩小麦基本上都种在经过秋翻半尺以上的土地上，其中一半麦田是深翻一尺左右的基本田，每亩施肥量在一万斤以上。呼伦贝尔盟突泉县，过去种谷子时，大部分不上粪，现在已在每亩谷子地里施肥三千斤，并推行了合理密植，种子进行风、筛选、发芽试验和药剂消毒。许多人民公社还挑选、训练了大批播种技术手，展开春播工具改革活动，使播种质量大大提高了。
    在春播运动中，内蒙古各地领导干部和机关工作人员纷纷深入农村，一面参加劳动，一面领导生产。中共乌兰察布盟委员会采取盟、旗（县、市）、公社、管理区和生产队五级干部会师田间的方式，加强了生产第一线的领导力量，因而发现问题较快，解决问题及时。
    本报长春12日电  吉林省今年共播种春小麦十八万多公顷，比去年增加一倍半以上。
    吉林省历来播种小麦很少。中共吉林省委从去年冬天起特别注意发动各地人民公社多种小麦，以满足人们生活水平不断增长的需要。全省今年3月就掀起了早种、多种小麦的热潮，4月底已播种完毕。
    吉林省今年的小麦，大部是种在经过深翻的土地上，基肥也较足，经过几场春雨，麦苗已生长三、四寸高，且油绿茁壮。现在各人民公社，正在一面进行春播，一面进行麦田铲趟。扶余县为保证小麦亩产五百一十斤，各公社普遍建立了麦田专人管理制度和护田公约，以确保及时铲趟、施肥。以风砂著称的白城地区，各人民公社还开展了小麦丰产竞赛运动，竭力争取小麦稳产、高产。  （蔡明）（附图片）
