Xinhua News Agency, 11th: The full text of Chairman Zhu De's speech at the enlarged meeting of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress is as follows: Dear Chairman Dieckmann, Vice-Chairman Matern, dear comrades of the delegation, comrades, friends:

　　Today, we are holding an enlarged meeting of the Second Session of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress to welcome the People's Chamber delegation of the German Democratic Republic headed by Chairman Johannes Dieckmann and Vice-Chairman Hermann Matern. We feel very honored and happy. Let us extend a warm welcome to our distinguished guests.

　　The German Democratic Republic is a strong bulwark on the western front of the socialist camp. Under the leadership of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany and the government of the German Democratic Republic, the hardworking, brave, and intelligent German people have achieved great successes in the cause of socialist construction and the socialist transformation of the national economy, greatly strengthening the strength of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. The German Democratic Republic has consistently struggled for a peaceful solution to the German question and the unification of all Germany on a democratic basis, and for the consolidation of peace in Europe and the world. This struggle has become an important factor in preventing the imperialist camp headed by the United States from launching a new world war.

　　The People's Republic of China and the German Democratic Republic are brothers of the same age. Common ideals and common interests closely link our two countries together, forming a great and unbreakable fraternal friendship forever. This friendship has developed greatly over the past ten years. It is particularly worth pointing out that in the socialist construction and various struggles of our people, the government and people of the German Democratic Republic have given us great help and support. Allow me to express my deep gratitude to the government and people of the German Democratic Republic on behalf of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and the Chinese people.

　　The East-West Foreign Ministers' Conference discussing the German issue is being held in Geneva today. The Chinese people resolutely support the just struggle of the German people to achieve peaceful reunification of their motherland, resolutely support the reasonable proposals put forward by the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic on the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany and the termination of the occupation system in West Berlin, and resolutely support the solemn position recently taken by the Warsaw Treaty member states and the Chinese Foreign Ministers' Conference on doing everything possible to ensure that the East-West talks contribute to the cause of peace.

　　Now, I would like to invite Chairman Dieckmann to deliver a speech.

    朱德委员长在人大常委会扩大会议上的讲话
    新华社11日讯　朱德委员长在人大常委会扩大会议上的讲话，全文如下：亲爱的狄克曼主席，马特恩副主席，亲爱的代表团全体同志们，同志们，朋友们：
    今天，召开第二届全国人民代表大会常务委员会第二次会议的扩大会议，来欢迎以约翰尼斯·狄克曼主席和赫尔曼·马特恩副主席为首的德意志民主共和国人民议院代表团，感到十分荣幸和愉快，让我们向贵宾们表示热烈的欢迎。
    德意志民主共和国是社会主义阵营西方前线的坚强堡垒。勤劳、勇敢和智慧的德国人民，在德国统一社会党和德意志民主共和国政府的领导下，在社会主义建设和对国民经济进行社会主义改造的事业中，获得了巨大的成就，大大加强了以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的力量。德意志民主共和国始终不渝地为和平解决德国问题和在民主的基础上统一全德国，为巩固欧洲和世界的和平而斗争。这个斗争，已经成为制止以美国为首的帝国主义阵营发动新的世界大战的阴谋的一个重要的因素。
    中华人民共和国和德意志民主共和国是同岁的兄弟。共同理想和共同利益，使我们两个国家紧密地联系在一起，结成了永远牢不可破的伟大的兄弟友谊。这种友谊，十年来得到了巨大的发展。特别值得指出的是，在我国人民的社会主义建设和各种斗争中，德意志民主共和国政府和人民，给了我们很大的帮助和支持。让我在这里代表全国人民代表大会常务委员会和中国人民，对德意志民主共和国政府和人民，表示深深的感谢。
    讨论德国问题的东西方外长会议，今天在日内瓦召开。中国人民坚决支持德国人民争取和平统一自己祖国的正义斗争，坚决支持苏联、德意志民主共和国就缔结对德和约和结束西柏林占领制度问题所提出的合理建议，坚决支持最近华沙条约缔约国和中国外长会议关于全力促使东西方会谈有助于和平事业的严正立场。
    现在，请狄克曼主席发表演说。
