　　Spare No Effort to Increase Production and Practice Economy
　　Jiangxi Iron Mines Technical Innovation Increases Productivity
　　Pig Iron Consumption Decreases Month by Month at Shanghai No. 6 Steel Plant
　　Xinhua News Agency report: Jiangxi Province's forty-plus large and small iron mines are carrying out a technical innovation movement, vigorously adopting indigenous machinery in all aspects of mining, ore transportation, and ore dressing, increasing labor productivity by more than twofold. In the first four months of this year, these mines produced more than 450,000 tons of iron ore, exceeding the production plan by 20%, and the ore grade (iron content) was above 40%.
　　Large-scale iron ore mining in Jiangxi started last year. Mining tools were relatively backward, and ore dressing equipment was also poor. Furthermore, most iron mines in the province are lean ores, with an iron content generally only around 27%. To meet the needs of the developing iron and steel industry, since the beginning of this year, Jiangxi has been carrying out a high-yield, high-quality, high-efficiency red banner competition movement centered on technical innovation, while consolidating, improving, and accelerating the construction of key iron mines. Many mines originally did not have pneumatic drills, and people used hand hammers to drill holes with steel chisels. Workers created various types of indigenous drilling machinery, such as long chisel impact drills, foot-operated drilling machines, universal drilling machines, and automatic rotating chisel foot-operated spring impact drilling machines. Apart from the steel chisel head, most of these drilling machines are made of bamboo and wood, which are low in cost and simple to manufacture, but the efficiency is two to three times higher than manual drilling. Previously, blasting was mostly small-hole blasting, with a small production surface. Workers implemented a method of combining large, medium, and small blasts, and combining indigenous and foreign explosives in open-pit mines, which not only expanded the production surface, but also solved the difficulty of insufficient explosives for large blasts.
　　In the past, many mines lacked modern transportation tools, which directly affected the expansion of the mining workface and ore dressing and external transfer work. In the technical innovation movement, workers created overhead indigenous cableways, bamboo chutes, wooden roads, inclined automatic winches, indigenous chutes, and various automatic unloading tipple frames, which not only accelerated the short-distance transportation of iron ore, but also saved a large amount of labor. The workers of each mine also created a large number of simple ore crushing and dressing machinery. The large-scale hanging bow flying hammer ore crushing machine they created is operated by eight people and crushes fifteen tons of ore per day, equivalent to the daily output of two hundred and fifty-five people hammering ore by hand.
　　Xinhua News Agency report: Workers at the Shanghai No. 6 Steel Plant have spared no effort to conserve pig iron in the high-yield and high-quality red banner competition, and pig iron consumption has decreased month by month in recent months.
　　In January, the average iron consumption for making one ton of steel at Shanghai No. 6 Steel Plant was 1,319 kilograms; in February, it was 1,298 kilograms; in March, it dropped to 1,263 kilograms; and in April, when the sulfur content of pig iron was high, the average consumption for making one ton of steel was only 1,251 kilograms. This figure has reached the iron consumption level required by the National Converter Steelmaking Conference to be achieved in the third quarter. Calculated at the current level, even without taking into account the further reduction in iron consumption in the future, this plant can save more than 4,500 tons of pig iron in the last three quarters of this year, and adding the pig iron already saved in the first quarter, it can increase steel production by 4,100 tons.
　　At the beginning of this year, while mobilizing the masses to increase steel production and quality, the Party organization of this plant paid attention to educating workers on conserving pig iron. In the discussion, the workers also criticized the past idea that "saving should not be emphasized when using indigenous iron to make steel." The workers said: Ironmaking workers work hard to make iron, and transportation workers transport iron from thousands of miles away. We must spare no effort to pay attention to conservation and turn every pound and ounce of iron into steel. In the competition, the workers of the entire plant compared not only output and quality, but also iron consumption.
　　It is indeed difficult to reduce iron consumption when the amount of indigenous iron used is large. In order to overcome this difficulty, Shanghai No. 6 Steel Plant has taken many measures in management and operation. In the past, there was no weighing system for materials in the workshop, and a large account was calculated once a month. No one investigated the reasons for using more or less. This year, they changed this "eating from the big pot" approach and established an iron material management system. Pig iron is weighed at every stage, starting from when it enters the factory, and the cupola also adopts a fixed quantity supply method for the molten iron required by the converter. The three shifts of workers calculate the material consumption and finished products separately, announce the iron consumption results every day, and analyze the material consumption situation, find the reasons, and improve operations if they find that the iron consumption has increased. When cupola workers see that the sulfur content of molten iron is high, the converter must increase the number of slagging operations, but with each additional slagging operation, a lot of molten iron is converted into iron oxide and blown away. They adopt two methods of desulfurization, inside and outside the furnace, to help converter workers reduce the number of slagging operations and save molten iron. The cupola itself also tries to reduce the loss of molten iron. Therefore, the molten iron loss of this cupola is only 2% to 3%, which is more than half lower than that of general factories.
　　The experience of this plant in conserving pig iron has attracted the attention of relevant departments and other steel plants. According to statistics from the Shanghai Municipal Metallurgical Industry Bureau, if the iron consumption of all steel plants in Shanghai can reach the current level of Shanghai No. 6 Steel Plant, Shanghai can save 330,000 tons of pig iron for the country this year while completing the state plan.

　　千方百计增产节约
    江西铁矿山技术革新生产率提高
    上海第六钢厂生铁耗量月月下降
    据新华社讯　江西全省四十多个大小铁矿山开展技术革新运动，在采矿、运矿、选矿各个环节上大力采用土机械，使劳动生产率提高一倍以上。今年头四个月内这些矿山产铁矿石四十五万余吨，超额20％完成了生产计划，而且矿石品位（含铁量）都在40％以上。
    江西铁矿大面积开采是从去年开始的，采矿工具比较落后，选矿设备也差，加上全省铁矿多是贫矿，含铁量一般只有27％左右。为了适应钢铁工业发展的需要，今年以来，江西在整顿、提高和加速重点铁矿山建设的同时，发动各铁矿职工开展以技术革新为中心的高产优质高工效红旗竞赛运动。许多矿山原来没有风钻，由人用手锤锤钢钎钻眼，职工们就创造了各种各样的土打眼机械，如长钎子冲击钻、足踏打眼机、万能打眼机、自动转钎脚踏弹簧冲击打眼机等。这些打眼机，除了钢钎头外，大部分结构都是用竹木做的，造价低，制造简单，工效却比人工打眼高两三倍。原来爆破大都是小眼爆破，生产面小，职工们在露天矿实行大中小爆破并举、土洋炸药结合的方法，既扩大了生产面，又解决了大爆破炸药不足的困难。
    过去许多矿山由于缺乏现代化运输工具，直接影响到采矿工作面的伸展和选矿、外调工作。在技术革新运动中职工们创造了架空土索道、竹滑道、木道、斜坡自动卷扬机、土溜槽和各种自动卸矿翻车架等，既加速了铁矿石的短距离运输，又节省了大批劳动力。各矿山职工还创造了大批简易碎矿、选矿机械。他们创造的大型吊弓飞锤碎矿机，八个人操作，每天碎矿十五吨，相当于二百五十五人手锤碎矿一天的产量。
    据新华社讯　上海第六钢铁厂职工在开展高产优质红旗竞赛中千方百计地节约生铁，这几个月来，生铁耗用量月月下降。
    1月份上钢六厂炼一吨钢平均用铁一千三百一十九公斤，2月份用铁一千二百九十八公斤，3月份下降到一千二百六十三公斤，4月份在生铁含硫较高的情况下炼一吨钢平均只用了一千二百五十一公斤铁。这个数字已经达到了全国转炉炼钢会议要求在第三季度达到的耗铁水平。按目前这个水平计算，即使不把以后进一步减少的用铁量计算在内，这个厂今年后三个季度内就可以节约四千五百多吨生铁，加上第一季度已经节约下来的生铁，可以增产四千一百吨钢。
    今年初，这个厂的党组织在发动群众提高钢的产量和质量的同时，就注意对职工进行节约生铁的教育。职工们在讨论中也批判了过去那种“用土铁炼钢不能讲究节约”的思想。工人们说：炼铁工人千辛万苦地把铁炼出来，运输工人千里迢迢把铁运来，我们一定要千方百计地注意节约，把一斤、一两的铁都炼成钢。全厂工人在竞赛中除了比产量质量外，就是比铁耗量。
    在土铁用量较大的情况下，要降低铁耗，确实有不少困难。上钢六厂为了克服这个困难，在管理上和操作上采取了许多措施。车间里过去用料没有过磅制度，一个月算一笔大账，用多用少也没有人追查原因。今年，他们改变了这种“吃大锅饭”的做法，建立了铁料管理制度。生铁从进厂开始，道道过磅，化铁炉对转炉需要的铁水也采取固定数量供应的办法。三班工人把用料和成品分开来计算，每天公布铁耗结果，发现铁耗量上升了就分析用料情况，找出原因，改进操作。化铁炉工人看见铁水含硫一高，转炉势必要增加造渣次数，但多造一次渣，就有许多铁水变成氧化铁被吹走。他们就采用炉内炉外两道去硫的办法，帮助转炉工人减少造渣次数，节约铁水。化铁炉本身也尽量减少铁水损耗，因此，这个化铁炉的铁水损耗只有2％到3％，比一般工厂低一半以上。
    这个厂节约生铁的经验，已经引起有关部门和其他钢厂的重视。据上海市冶金工业局的统计，如果上海各钢厂的铁耗都能达到上钢六厂的目前水平，今年上海在完成国家计划时，就可以为国家节约三十三万吨生铁。
