　　Changchun, May 12 (This newspaper dispatch) - The Daling Management Area of the Daling People's Commune in Yushu County, Jilin Province, following the mass line and conducting investigations and research, has formulated practical production quotas, further arousing the production enthusiasm of production teams and commune members, and promoting spring plowing.

　　According to the commune's unified plan, this management area will plant 1,770 hectares of land this year. During the preparation for farming, the management area formulated a production plan and convened a meeting of production team cadres to deploy it. However, the production teams did not fully mobilize the masses for discussion, and many commune members were unaware of the production quotas set by the management area; even those who knew did not pay much attention. Whether the quotas were truly practical and feasible was unknown to both cadres and commune members. After discovering this situation, the Party branch of the management area immediately mobilized the masses for discussion, utilizing the experience of contracting production in advanced cooperatives, so that the production quotas could take root among the masses.

　　During the discussion of production quotas, the entire management area universally launched airing of views and debates. Commune members discussed it very seriously, and debates could be heard everywhere, in the fields, at the dinner table, and in various meetings. During the debates, some cadres did not proceed from reality, hoping that the quotas would be as high as possible, believing that this could inspire the commune members' enthusiasm. Some people also believed that production quotas must be practical; but they dared not say it directly, fearing criticism for being "conservative," and therefore adopted a follow-the-crowd attitude.

　　How high should the quotas be? How can the quotas be both advanced and have room for overproduction? After careful study, the Party branch believed that to do this work well, it was necessary to consistently implement the working method of the mass line. Under the leadership of the Party branch, a production contracting and evaluation committee was specially established. In addition to the participation of cadres from the management area and production teams, the committee also absorbed experienced veteran farmers. In the process of contracting production, sixteen meetings were held, and more than ten veteran farmers' symposiums were held successively to solicit opinions widely. To make the production quotas have a more concrete factual basis, they also conducted field surveys and measurements of the land, and calculated detailed output accounts based on soil, fertilizer, water and other conditions, plus this year's situation of strengthening field management. Through such meticulous work, the branch got to the bottom of the matter, thus persuading all kinds of unrealistic people and formulating practical production quotas.

　　After discussing the production quotas and measures, the production enthusiasm of the commune members was greatly inspired, setting off a new and greater production upsurge throughout the management area. Production teams and production groups launched labor competitions to achieve leap forward targets. The attendance rate and labor efficiency have been greatly improved. This management area completed the sowing task on April 24, fifteen days ahead of the time stipulated by the commune. In order to ensure that the seedlings are complete, uniform and strong, the commune members are carefully checking the quality of sowing, conducting quality "make-up lessons," and launching a shock campaign to accumulate and produce fertilizer, and increase the application of fertilizer.

### 发动群众充分讨论  深入田间仔细调查  大岭管理区包产指标切合实际

    发动群众充分讨论  深入田间仔细调查
    大岭管理区包产指标切合实际
    本报长春12电  吉林省榆树县大岭人民公社大岭管理区，走群众路线，经过调查研究，制定出切实可行的包产指标，进一步调动起生产队和社员的生产积极性，推动了春耕生产。
    这个管理区根据公社的统一计划，今年要种一千七百七十公顷地。在备耕阶段，管理区就制定了生产计划，并召开生产队干部会布置下去。但是，生产队没有充分发动群众讨论，管理区定的产量指标，许多社员不知道；有些人虽然知道，但也不十分关心。指标是否真正切实可行，干部和社员都心中无数。管理区党支部发现这种情况后，立即发动群众进行讨论，运用高级社时的包产经验，使产量指标在群众中落脚生根。
    在讨论包产指标时，全管理区普遍开展起鸣放、辩论。社员们讨论的非常认真，地里、饭桌上、各种会议上，到处都可以听到辩论的声音。辩论中，有的干部不从实际出发，希望指标愈高愈好，认为这样可以鼓足社员的干劲。也有一部分人认为生产指标必须力求切合实际；但不敢直说，怕被批评为“保守”，因而抱着随大流态度。
    究竟指标多高合适？怎样把指标定的又先进，又有超产余地呢？党支部在进行了仔细研究后，认为要把这件工作作好，必须始终贯彻执行群众路线的工作方法。在党支部领导下，专门成立了包工包产评议委员会，委员会除有管理区、生产队的干部参加外，还吸收了有经验的老农参加。在包工包产的过程中，召开过十六次会议，还先后分别开过十多次老农座谈会，广泛征求意见。为使包产指标有更具体的事实根据，他们还分别对土地进行踏查，丈量，根据土、肥、水等条件，加上今年要加强田间管理的情况算了产量细账。通过这样一些细致的工作，支部摸到了底，从而说服了各种不实事求是的人，制定出切合实际的包产指标。
    经过讨论包产指标和措施，大大启发了社员的生产积极性，在全管理区范围内掀起一个新的更大的生产高潮。生产队与生产队、生产组与生产组展开为实现跃进指标的劳动竞赛。出勤率和劳动效率大大提高。这个管理区比社里规定的时间提前十五天，于4月24日完成了播种任务。社员为了保证做到苗全苗齐苗壮，正在细致地检查播种质量，进行质量“补课”，突击积肥、造肥，增施肥料。  （李树功）
