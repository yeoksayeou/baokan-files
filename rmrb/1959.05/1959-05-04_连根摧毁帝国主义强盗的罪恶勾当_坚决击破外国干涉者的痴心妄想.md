Comrades:

I fully agree with Premier Zhou Enlai's "Government Work Report" and all other reports.

The former Tibet local government and the upper-class reactionary clique launched an armed rebellion to split the motherland. The Central People's Government adopted resolute measures to quell the rebellion, making brilliant contributions to safeguarding the sacred cause of the unification of the motherland and opening up a bright path for the thorough liberation of the broad masses of the Tibetan people. The people of the whole country, including the broad masses of the Tibetan people, are all greatly encouraged by this. Recent developments have proven that the Tibetan rebel clique is a heinous criminal who colludes with foreign countries, betrays the people of the motherland, and violates the tenets of Buddhism. Their behind-the-scenes string-pullers and supporters are the old colonialist "pioneers" and the Indian expansionists who inherited the mantle of British colonialists. The Tibetan rebel clique, out of its reactionary class instinct, stubbornly clings to the serf system that fattens itself by drinking human blood, fantasizing about living a life of extravagance and depravity for a long time; the imperialists and Indian expansionists covet Tibet, dreaming of preserving the colonial cause for thousands of years. "Birds of a feather flock together, people are divided into groups by category." Therefore, the Tibetan reactionary rebel clique is as closely linked with imperialist elements and Indian expansionist elements as glue. Faced with such a complex situation, we should express very clearly with practical actions: the broad masses of the Tibetan people must get rid of the oppression and enslavement of the inhuman serf system, the Tibetan reactionary rebel clique must be punished as it deserves, the sinister schemes and their impact of the imperialist robbers in Tibet must be thoroughly exposed and uprooted, and the wishful thinking of the Indian expansionist elements must be resolutely shattered. To some individuals in Indian political circles who do not judge the hour and size up the situation, we must offer a piece of advice: wake up! Any interference in the internal affairs of the People's Republic of China can only result in lifting a stone to drop it on one's own feet. Not a single bit of benefit can be gained. In the end, you can only end up with a bloody nose and a swollen face.

1958 was an inspiring year of great leap forward. In this year, industrial and agricultural production and cultural and educational construction undertakings developed by leaps and bounds, people's communes were universally established and continuously consolidated throughout the country, people's ideological awareness was greatly improved, and people's living standards were significantly improved. All this proves that the general line of building socialism formulated by the Chinese Communist Party has a very powerful force. Continuing to implement the general line of socialist construction will enable us to confidently achieve a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward this year.

The 1959 national economic development plan, centered on the four major targets, is a magnificent plan. There is an objective possibility of realizing this plan; however, there are also many difficulties and obstacles. To overcome difficulties and eliminate obstacles, we need to further develop subjective initiative and engage in unremitting struggle under the guidance of the general line. The great practice of the Great Leap Forward in 1958 proves: of all things, putting politics in command is the most important; of all plans, the mass line is the best plan. Strengthening the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and adhering to the working style of the mass line, organizing the iron-like strength of the people, will surely enable us to victoriously complete and overfulfill the leap forward plan for the development of the national economy in 1959. Strengthening the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party is the fundamental guarantee for achieving all victories. Strengthening the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party enables us to discern the shortcomings and errors that may occur in all our work, and enables these local, temporary, and unavoidable shortcomings and errors in the course of advancement to be quickly overcome and corrected. Adhering to the working style of the mass line enables all cadres to deeply understand that the main body that creates history and promotes the Great Leap Forward is the masses, and the main body that the mass line serves is also the masses. Therefore, it is necessary to continue to carry forward the fine democratic tradition, consult with the masses sincerely in everything, and listen patiently to the voices of the masses. Major issues and minor issues, no matter how big or small, should be debated extensively and openly among the masses to unify the masses' thinking and actions. Only by relying on the masses can we be invincible, indestructible, and unconquerable.

In the seething life of the masses, in the leaping ranks of the masses, as a small screw and a loyal soldier, we have all made contributions within our power. However, in the face of the dazzling creations of the masses, we cannot help but feel that the wisdom and labor we have invested are so insignificant and trivial after all. Still the old saying: the situation is pressing. To catch up with the ranks of the masses who are advancing by leaps and bounds, we must further transform ourselves. "The superior man is constantly striving for self-improvement." In the resounding bugle call of the Great Leap Forward in 1959, I use these words to encourage myself and to give them to my friends and comrades.

### 连根摧毁帝国主义强盗的罪恶勾当  坚决击破外国干涉者的痴心妄想

    连根摧毁帝国主义强盗的罪恶勾当
    坚决击破外国干涉者的痴心妄想
    唐生智代表的发言各位代表：
    我完全同意周恩来总理的“政府工作报告”和其它各项报告。
    原西藏地方政府及上层反动集团进行分裂祖国的武装叛乱，中央人民政府采取了坚决的平叛措施，为捍卫祖国的神圣统一事业作出了光辉的贡献，为广大西藏人民的彻底解放开辟了光明的坦途。全国人民，包括广大藏族人民，对此莫不感到欢欣鼓舞。最近事态的发展证明：西藏叛乱集团是里通外国、背叛祖国人民、违反佛教宗旨的万恶罪人，他们的幕后牵线者和支持者，是老牌的殖民主义“开拓家”们，和继英国殖民者衣钵的印度扩张主义分子。西藏叛乱集团出于自己的反动的阶级本能，死死抱住喝人血以自肥的农奴制度不放，幻想长期过着骄奢淫邪的生活；帝国主义者和印度扩张主义分子对西藏垂涎三尺，梦想殖民事业保留千秋万世。“物以类聚，人以群分”，因之，西藏的反动叛乱集团就和帝国主义分子、印度的扩张主义分子如胶似漆地结合起来了。对于这样一种复杂的情况，我们应该以实际行动十分明确地表示：广大西藏人民必须摆脱非人的农奴制度的压迫和奴役，西藏反动叛乱集团必须受到应有的惩罚，帝国主义强盗们在西藏的罪恶勾当及其影响必须彻底揭露和连根摧毁，印度扩张主义分子的痴心妄想必须坚决击破。对印度某些政界人士不审时度理的人物，我们有必要在此进一忠言：头脑清醒一点罢！对中华人民共和国内政的任何干预，其结果都只能是自己搬石头砸自己的脚，一丝半点好处不能捞到，到头来只能使自己碰得鼻青脸肿。
    一九五八年是一个振奋人心的伟大的跃进年度。在这一年中，工农业生产和文化教育建设事业飞跃发展，人民公社在全国普遍建立并且不断巩固，人民思想觉悟大大提高，群众生活水平显著改善。这一切，证明中国共产党所制定的建设社会主义的总路线具有十分强大的威力。继续贯彻执行社会主义建设的总路线，将使我们确有把握地实现今年更大更好更全面的跃进。
    以四大指标为中心的一九五九年的发展国民经济计划，是一个宏伟的计划。实现这个计划，存在着客观的可能性；但是，也有许多困难和障碍。要克服困难和排除障碍，需要我们按照总路线的指引，进一步发挥主观能动性，从事不懈的战斗。一九五八年大跃进的伟大实践证明：千条万条，政治挂帅第一条；千计万计，群众路线第一计。加强中国共产党的领导和坚持群众路线的工作作风，将人民群众的钢铁般的力量组织起来，就一定能够胜利地完成和超额完成一九五九年的发展国民经济的跃进计划。加强中国共产党的领导，是取得一切胜利的根本保证。加强中国共产党的领导，使我们有可能洞察一切工作中可能发生的缺点和错误，并使这些局部的、暂时的、在前进途中不可免的缺点和错误，得以迅速克服和纠正。坚持群众路线的工作作风，使全体干部深刻了解：创造历史和推动大跃进的主体是群众，群众路线服务的主体也是群众。因此，必须继续发扬优良的民主传统，遇事和群众进行推心置腹的商量，耐心地倾听群众的呼声。大是大非，小是小非，事无巨细，都应该在群众中进行大鸣大放大辩论，统一群众的思想认识和行动步调。只有依靠了群众，我们才能无往不胜，无坚不摧，无攻不克。
    在沸腾的群众生活里，在跃进的群众队伍中，作为一个细小的螺丝钉和一名忠实的列兵，我们都曾作过力所能及的贡献。但是，在光彩夺目的群众的创造面前，我们又不能不感到自己投入的智慧和劳动，毕竟是如此微末和渺小。仍然是一句老话：形势逼人。要想赶上大踏步前进着的群众的行列，就必须进一步地进行自我改造。“君子乾乾，自强不息。”在一九五九年大跃进的嘹亮号角声中，我以此语自勉，并以此语赠给朋友们和同志们。
