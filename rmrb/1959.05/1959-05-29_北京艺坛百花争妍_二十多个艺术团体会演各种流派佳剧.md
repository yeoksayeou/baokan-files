    Beijing Art Scene in Full Bloom: Over Twenty Art Troupes Present Masterpieces of Various Genres

    (Our reporter Hong Helin reports) In May, the Beijing art scene is a riot of color, with artists of all genres showing their talents and engaging in artistic discussions and debates according to their own perspectives. The recently concluded first Beijing Art Troupes Performance and Observation of 1959 vividly reflects this flourishing and prosperous scene in the art world.

    More than twenty art troupes participated in this performance, holding twenty-seven performances in total. The programs included large and medium-sized Peking operas, Ping operas, plays, operas, ballet dramas, symphonies, puppet shows, as well as short and refined excerpts, folk songs and dances, acrobatics, and ballad singing. There were new plays by famous artists and works by amateur authors, making Beijing in May a garden where excellent Chinese and foreign plays gathered and a hundred flowers bloomed.

        Bold New Attempts

    One-third of the programs in this performance were new plays being performed for the first time in China. Many of them made bold new attempts in terms of creation and performance art. The Ping opera "Along the Jinsha River" performed by the China Ping Opera Troupe, for the first time relatively successfully presented a major historical and political theme like the Long March of the Red Army, and developed Ping opera music, enriching the previously incomplete male vocal style. Even some people who didn't like Ping opera in the past felt that Ping opera was "very flavorful" and "very promising" after watching it. The world-famous ballet "Le Corsaire" performed by teachers and students of the China Dance School showed that they had made significant progress in learning and mastering the art of ballet performance compared to their performance of "Swan Lake" a year ago. The young "actors" not only danced harmoniously, but also portrayed the spiritual aspects of the characters relatively delicately through dance. The historical drama "Cai Wenji," a new work by Guo Moruo performed by the Beijing People's Art Theatre, was a step higher than the performances of "Tiger Tally" and "Guan Hanqing" in terms of using traditional opera techniques to enrich the expressiveness of spoken drama. Composer Luo Zhongrong composed the magnificent and inspiring "First Symphony" based on Chairman Mao's poem "Huanxisha." Musicians believe that although this piece has not been fully written, it can be preliminarily affirmed that it is one of the rare outstanding works since liberation. At present, very few people at home and abroad have dealt with this huge theme of several hundred million people as the main image, summarizing their century-long revolutionary struggle. Luo Zhongrong broke through several old conventions in his creation and absorbed materials that people liked to hear from folk songs and revolutionary songs, so this large-scale symphony, although complex in structure, is relatively easy for the general public to understand. Luo Zhongrong's works are magnificent in style, while Li Huanzhi's symphonies are delicate and moving, each with its own characteristics. Composer Li Huanzhi's new symphony "Heroic Island, Red Flag Flying" praised the heroic people of Xiamen.

    In addition, the Central Song and Dance Troupe performed the chorus "Locking the Dragon Pool," reflecting the conquest of the Yellow River, and the China Youth Art Theatre performed the play "Nameless Island," with the Kinmen sea battle as the theme. They both reflected real life in a timely and powerful manner, and were well received by the audience. Beijing audiences also enjoyed Shostakovich's Eleventh Symphony and Tchaikovsky's Piano Concerto performed by Chinese artists for the first time. The excellent foreign programs in this performance also included Molière's famous comedy "The Miser" and Goldoni's "The Servant of Two Masters."

    A batch of old plays that have been carefully refined and processed by various art troupes since this spring also shone with new brilliance in the performance and observation.

        Learning from Each Other's Strengths Among Different Genres

    This performance of retained repertoire embodies the spirit of mutual learning from each other's strengths among various genres. The Peking operas "The Orphan of Zhao," "The Tablet of Life and Death," and "Wangjiang Pavilion," which were praised, have all absorbed new nourishment from fraternal genres, making their own performance art richer and more colorful. "The Orphan of Zhao" performed by Tan Fuying, Ma Lianliang, Qiu Shengrong, etc., was adapted from "Searching for the Orphan and Saving the Orphan," with passionate and慷慨 lyrics, full of loyalty. "The Tablet of Life and Death" performed by Li He and others was adapted from the homonymous plays in Hunan Flower Drum Opera, Ping Opera, and Kunqu Opera. It absorbed many of the strengths of each family and further developed the refined and distinct characteristics of Peking Opera art, excellently praising the noble qualities of ancient Chinese heroes who sacrificed themselves to save others. Zhang Junqiu comprehensively reorganized and performed "Wangjiang Pavilion," integrating some of the advantages of the Sichuan Opera "Tan Ji'er" and the artistic treatment of the film "Wangjiang Pavilion," which more delicately showed the different styles of "stillness," "sweetness," "liveliness," and "firmness" in the four acts before and after. The Central Song and Dance Troupe went deep into Yunnan, Guangxi, Sichuan, Henan and other provinces for half a year and collected and adapted a batch of new programs from all ethnic groups, which were hailed as "new buds of folk songs and dances" in this performance. These folk songs and dances are not only loved by the audience for their fresh and vigorous style, but more importantly, they bring the audience into the surging reality of life with their artistic charm, and share the joy of labor with the masters of the songs and dances. Many viewers said after watching the performance: "It can be seen that the authors and actors really went to the folk."

        Different Schools of Art Showcase Their Strengths

    Promoting the characteristics of different schools of art in various genres and actors is also a significant feature of this performance. Many well-known old artists performed programs that represent their artistic characteristics, allowing the audience to have the honor of seeing their brilliance again. Mei Lanfang gave a public performance of his first new play since liberation, "Mu Guiying Takes Command." Through the performance of the middle-aged Mu Guiying returning to the battlefield, he expressed his heroic feelings of "being strong when old and never-ending life." Some Peking Opera critics praised Mei Lanfang's performance for reaching the superb realm of Peking Opera art of "one person performing the entire stage." The sixty-year-old Xun Huisheng performed the sixteen-year-old girl "Jin Yunu." Hebei Bangzi actor Li Guiyun and Peking Opera actors Zhao Yanxia and Wu Suqiu all performed excerpts, some focusing on singing and others focusing on acting. Yang Xiaoting, an old artist from the China Acrobatic Troupe, presented his wonderful skills that he hadn't shown for many years—ancient color magic. After taking out more than twenty glass tanks filled with water and fish from his arms, he took off his robe and somersaulted on the stage, and then conjured a large glass tank filled with water from his arms, making the audience applaud. People also happily saw from the performances of young actors that the new seedlings irrigated with the hard work of the older generation of artists are growing vigorously. Cheng school Qingyi Li Shiji inherited the characteristics of Cheng's singing style in the performance of the excerpt "Three Slaps," singing with strength and gentleness, and acting with firmness and softness. Eight Hebei Bangzi child actors with an average age of only eleven performed the heavy martial arts play "Losing Baziqiu" and the acting play "Returning Home with Joy." Although "Little Zhou Yu" on the stage was carrying "three major pieces," he was able to perform a clean and neat somersault after a fierce battle. Experts said that without diligent study and hard practice, there would be no such wonderful "somersault." At a concert at the Central Conservatory of Music, the "Young Pioneers" orchestra composed of students from the affiliated middle school played the second movement of Haydn's famous Symphony No. 100. Their performance was not only technically skilled, but also full of emotion and vigor.

        A Hundred Flowers Blooming Drives a Hundred Schools of Thought to Contend

    The blooming of a hundred flowers in art performances has also driven the contention of a hundred schools of thought in the art world. At the same time as the performance and observation, a wave of artistic discussion was set off, pushing the mass discussion on improving artistic quality that has been launched in Beijing this spring to a new stage. Many professional writers, artists, amateur art enthusiasts, and observers from more than ten cities including Northeast, Hebei, Central South, Northwest, and East China expressed their opinions in the discussion, and put forward their own views on the ideology and artistry of the works. Many speeches touched on issues such as creative thinking, artistic theory, and performance methods. Many views were sharply opposed, and sometimes several different opinions appeared on one issue.

    The audience was satisfied with this performance and observation, but also raised many questions. Some viewers pointed out that there are not many dramas that reflect real life in dramas and operas, some programs are not full enough, and there are fewer small and medium-sized works, and some large-scale dramas should be further refined. There are still different degrees of pursuit of form and ostentation in the performance and stage art of some dramas, and individual dramas fundamentally destroy the style of the original genre.

    Now, the various troupes participating in the performance and related art workers are continuing to widely solicit opinions from all parties, summarizing the experience of this performance and observation, and actively organizing and processing the performed programs in order to welcome a greater harvest in artistic creation and performance.

    北京艺坛百花争妍
    二十多个艺术团体会演各种流派佳剧
    本报讯　记者洪和临报道：5月，北京艺坛百花齐放，万紫千红；各流派的艺术工作者，在大显身手的同时，并且按照各自的见解，展开了艺术讨论和争鸣。刚刚结束的北京市艺术团体1959年第一次观摩演出，生动地反映了艺坛上的这种兴旺、繁荣的景象。
    这次演出有二十多个艺术团体参加，先后举行了二十七次演出，节目中有大、中型的京剧、评剧、话剧、歌剧、芭蕾舞剧、交响乐、木偶戏，也有短小精悍的折子戏、民间歌舞、杂技、曲艺；有名家的新戏，又有业余作者的作品，使5月的北京成为古今中外佳剧荟萃、百花争艳的园地。
          大胆的新尝试
    这次演出有三分之一的节目是国内第一次演出的新剧。其中有不少在创作和表演艺术等方面做了大胆的新的尝试。中国评剧院演出的评剧“金沙江畔”，使惯于表现儿女情长和家庭故事的评剧，第一次比较出色地表现了红军长征这样的重大历史、政治主题，并且发展了评剧音乐，丰富了过去很不完整的男腔。就是过去有些不喜欢评剧的人看了后也觉得评剧“很有滋味”，“大有前途”。中国舞蹈学校师生演出的世界著名芭蕾舞剧“海侠”，表现出他们在学习和掌握芭蕾舞剧表演艺术方面，已比一年前演出“天鹅湖”时有了显著进步，年轻的“演员”们不仅舞得和谐，而且通过舞蹈比较细致地刻划出了角色的精神面貌。北京人民艺术剧院演出的郭沫若新作历史剧“蔡文姬”，在运用戏曲的传统技巧以丰富话剧表现力方面，比演出“虎符”、“关汉卿”两剧时又高一筹。作曲家罗忠熔根据毛主席的词“浣溪沙”谱成了气魄宏伟、激动人心的“第一交响乐”。音乐界人士认为，这部乐曲虽然还没全部写成，但可以初步肯定，它是解放以来不可多得的优秀作品之一。目前国内外还很少有人处理这种以几亿人为主要形象、概括他们百年来革命斗争的巨大主题。罗忠熔在创作中突破了若干旧的程式，并且从民歌、革命歌曲中吸收了人民喜见乐闻的素材，因此这部大型交响乐虽然结构复杂，却比较容易为一般听众所理解。罗忠熔的作品气魄雄伟、李焕之的交响乐细致动人，各有特色。作曲家李焕之新作的交响乐“英雄海岛红旗飘”歌颂了英雄的厦门人民。
    此外，中央歌舞团演出了反映征服黄河的大合唱“锁龙潭”，中国青年艺术剧院演出以金门海战为主题的话剧“无名岛”，它们都及时、有力地反映了现实生活，受到观众的好评。北京观众还欣赏了我国艺术家第一次演出的萧斯塔科维奇第十一交响乐和柴可夫斯基的钢琴协奏曲。这次演出的优秀外国节目还有莫里哀的著名喜剧“悭吝人”和哥尔多尼的“一仆二主”等。
    各个艺术团体今春以来整理加工的一批千锤百炼的老戏也在观摩演出中放出了新的光彩。
        剧种之间取长补短
    这次整理演出的保留剧目体现了各剧种之间相互采长补短的精神。受到赞扬的京剧“赵氏孤儿”、“生死牌”和“望江亭”，都从兄弟剧种中吸取了新的营养，使本身的表演艺术更为丰富多彩。谭富英、马连良、裘盛戎等演出的“赵氏孤儿”，是由“搜孤救孤”改编的，唱词激昂慷慨，充满着忠义之气。李和曾等演出的“生死牌”，是根据湖南花鼓戏、评剧、昆曲中的同名剧目改编的，它吸取了各家的许多长处而又进一步发挥了京剧艺术洗炼、鲜明的特点，出色地歌颂了我国古代义士舍己救人的高贵品质。张君秋综合了川剧“谭记儿”、电影“望江亭”艺术处理上的一些优点重新整理演出了“望江亭”，在前后四场中，比较以前更为细腻地表现出“静”、“甜”、“活”、“刚”的不同风格。中央歌舞团半年来深入云南、广西、四川、河南等省，从各族人民中搜集改编的一批新节目，在这次演出中被誉为“民间歌舞的新葩”。这些民间歌舞不但以清新刚健的格调为观众所喜爱，更重要的是它们以自己的艺术魅力，把观众带进万马奔腾的现实生活之中，同歌舞所表现的主人公共享了劳动的欢乐。许多观众在看了演出以后说：“看得出作者和演员们真是到民间去了”。
        不同流派各抒所长
    发扬各剧种、演员不同流派的特长，也是这次演出的一个显著特点。许多知名的老艺术家都演出了代表他们艺术特色的节目，使观众们有幸重睹芳华。梅兰芳公演了他解放以后的第一出新戏“穆桂英挂帅”。他通过演出重登疆场的中年穆桂英，倾吐出他“老当益壮，生生不已”的豪迈心情。有的京剧评论家称赞梅兰芳这次表演达到了“一个人演满全台”的京剧艺术的高超境界。六十岁的荀慧生这次表演了十六岁的少女“金玉奴”。河北梆子演员李桂云、京剧演员赵燕侠、吴素秋都分别表演了折子戏，有的重在唱工，有的重在做工。中国杂技团老艺人杨小亭这次献出了他多年没露的妙技——古彩戏法，他在从怀里掏出了二十多个盛水装鱼的玻璃缸以后，脱袍在台上翻了一个跟头，又从怀里变出了一个装水的大玻璃缸，使观众拍手叫绝。人们还从青年演员的演出中，欣喜地看到老一辈艺术家用心血浇灌的新苗正在茁壮地成长 程派青衣李世济这次在演唱折子戏“三击掌”中，继承了程腔的特点，唱来劲婉相济，做来刚柔并现。平均只有十一岁的八名河北梆子小演员表演了繁重的武功戏“丧巴丘”和做工戏“喜荣归”。舞台上的“小周瑜”虽然身负“三大件”，却能在一阵鏖战后，再来一个干净利爽的倒翻跟头。专家们说，没有勤学苦练，就没有这精彩的一“翻”。在中央音乐学院的一次音乐会上，由附属中学学生组成的“红领巾”管弦乐队演奏了世界知名的海顿第一○○交响乐第二乐章。他们的演奏不仅技术熟练，而且感情充沛，朝气勃勃。
      百花齐放带动百家争鸣
    艺术演出上的百花齐放，也带动了艺术界的百家争鸣。在观摩演出的同时，掀起了一个艺术讨论热潮，把北京今春以来展开的群众性提高艺术质量的讨论推向一个新的阶段。许多专业作家、艺术家、业余艺术爱好者以及来自东北、河北、中南、西北、华东等十多个城市的观摩人员，在讨论中都各抒己见，对作品的思想性、艺术性提出了各自的见解，很多发言都接触到创作思想、艺术理论和表演方法等方面的问题。许多看法针锋相对，有时在一个问题上出现了几个不同的意见。
    观众们对这次的观摩演出是满意的，但也提出了不少问题。有的观众指出话剧、歌剧反映现实生活的剧目还不多，有些节目还不够充实，中小型作品也较少，有些大型剧目还应该进一步去芜存菁。有些剧目的表演和舞台美术方面还存在着程度不同的追求形式，华而不实的情况，其中个别的戏从根本上破坏了原剧种的风格。
    现在，参加演出的各个剧团和有关艺术工作者，正在继续广泛征求各方面的意见，总结这次观摩演出的经验，对所演节目积极进行整理和加工，以迎接艺术创作和演出的更大丰收。（附图片）
