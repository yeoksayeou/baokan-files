Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 7th: Over the past month or so, many regions across the country have held materials exchange fairs. Through the signing of production and sales contracts or agreements, these exchange fairs in various localities have facilitated the exchange of third-category commodities in a planned and organized manner, promoting the production and circulation of these commodities.

According to preliminary statistics provided by the First National Third Category Materials Exchange Conference, which opened on the 6th, nine provinces, including Hebei, Henan, Jiangxi, Jiangsu, Yunnan, and Guizhou, have already held provincial-level materials exchange conferences. Thousands of special districts, counties, and people's communes have also held materials exchange fairs. Under the guidance of the "Nation as a Single Chessboard" ideology, discussions are held at all levels of exchange fairs. Material accounts are calculated, big-character posters are put up by both producers and sellers, production and sales situations are communicated, and material exchanges are conducted in a planned manner.

At the various levels of materials exchange fairs, representatives from counties and communes, in accordance with the spirit of "Nation as a Single Chessboard," actively support the cities, providing many industrial raw materials and construction materials for industrial and capital construction departments.

This planned material exchange has further cleared commodity circulation channels, making the cooperative relationships between urban and rural areas, regions, industry and commerce, and within commerce itself even closer. At many exchange conferences, producers and sellers restored certain commodity supply and demand relationships or established new cooperative relationships. The exchange fairs adjusted materials that were needed in place A but stockpiled in place B, making commodity deployment more reasonable. For example, at the exchange fair held in Mianyang Special District, Sichuan, 48 types of third-category commodities were adjusted among the counties. Guangyuan County allocated its surplus bamboo poles and baskets to Deyang County, which was short of them. Suining County learned that Guangyuan County lacked seeds for chili peppers, sweet potatoes, and pumpkins and actively provided support. All parties were satisfied.

After rectification and further implementation of the principle of unified leadership and tiered management, the enthusiasm of commune members for production has increased even more. Based on the contracts signed at the materials exchange fairs, they are actively arranging the production of third-category materials, seeking production avenues in many ways, which promotes the development of diversified economies in the people's communes. Zhaodong County, Heilongjiang Province, did not originally produce reed mats or reed pads, but after holding a materials exchange fair this year, it decided to produce 15,000 pieces. The county originally planned to produce less than 2,000 tons of native saltpeter this year, but now the production teams of each commune have decided to produce 5,000 tons. The production of medicinal materials has also increased from more than a dozen types last year to more than 70 types.

### 许多地区召开物资交流会  积极安排第三类商品生产

　　许多地区召开物资交流会
    积极安排第三类商品生产
    据新华社上海7日电　最近一个多月来，全国许多地区召开了物资交流会。各地的交流会通过签订产销合同或协议，有计划、有组织地交流了第三类商品，促进了这类商品的生产和流通。
    据6日开幕的全国第一次三类物资交流大会提供的初步资料统计，到目前为止，已有河北、河南、江西、江苏、云南、贵州等九个省召开了全省的物资交流大会，数以千计的专区、县和人民公社也举行了物资交流会。各级交流会普遍在“全国一盘棋”思想指导下进行讨论，算物资帐，由产销双方贴大字报，展览样品，沟通产销情况，有计划地进行物资交流。
    在各级物资交流会上，县和公社的代表根据“全国一盘棋”的精神，积极支援城市，为工业和基本建设部门提供了许多工业原料和建筑器材。
    这样有计划地进行物资交流，就进一步疏通了商品流通渠道，使城乡、地区、工商之间以及商业内部的协作关系更加密切了。在不少交流大会上，产销双方恢复了某些商品供需关系，或者建立了新的协作关系。交流会对于有些甲地需要而乙地积压的物资作了调剂，使商品摆布更加合理。如四川绵阳专区举行的交流会上，各县之间调剂的三类商品有四十八种。广原县把备货较多的竹杠、箩兜调剂给缺货的德阳县；遂宁县了解广原县缺少辣椒、地瓜、南瓜等种籽，也主动给予支援。各方面都感到满意。
    各地人民公社经过整顿和进一步贯彻统一领导，分级管理的原则后，社员生产积极性更加高涨。他们根据物资交流会签订的合同，积极安排第三类物资的生产，多方面地寻找生产门路，这就促进了人民公社多种经济的发展。黑龙江省肇东县原来不生产苇席、苇茓，今年开过物资交流会后，决定生产一万五千片；全县今年原来安排土硝生产不到两千吨，现在各公社的生产队决定生产五千吨；药材生产也从去年的十几种增加到七十多种。
