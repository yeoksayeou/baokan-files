    New Things in Industry
    Huagong
    The recent five-level cadre meeting convened by the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry is a new thing that has emerged in the industrial sector. It is new because in the past, industrial departments have not held meetings like this, attended by leaders from the ministry down to workshop and work section cadres. This kind of meeting is a creation of the mass line and a new and relatively good method of combining mass movements with centralized leadership. Grassroots cadres and the broad masses of workers have extremely close ties. They are very familiar with the situation and problems in enterprise production and construction, as well as the emotions and demands of the broad masses of workers. Direct meetings between the leaders of the ministry and them help to deeply and specifically grasp the rhythm and pulse of the mass movement.
    Mass movement and centralized leadership are two mutually dependent and interconnected aspects; they are a unity of opposites. The Central Committee's decision on methods of leadership states: "Only the activism of the leading core, without being combined with the activism of the masses, will become the empty busyness of a few. But if the broad masses have only their own activism, without strong leading cadres to appropriately organize the activism of the masses, then the activism of the masses cannot be sustained, nor can it move in the right direction and be raised to a higher level." These few sentences fully reveal the dialectical relationship between mass movement and centralized leadership.
    According to the laws of movement and development, the two aspects of the unity of opposites also have a dominant aspect under certain conditions. When the mass movement has not yet risen, the leadership's main task is to boldly mobilize the masses; when the mass movement has already been widely carried out, centralized leadership becomes the dominant aspect. The art of leadership lies in grasping the dominant aspect, strengthening the dominant aspect, combining the mass movement with centralized leadership, and promoting the continuous advancement of the mass movement.
    The five-level cadre meeting convened by the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry enabled the ministry's leading cadres to understand many more specific situations that were difficult to understand in general two-level or three-level cadre meetings, and at the same time, it brought the ministry's intentions and plans directly to the grassroots. This truly achieved communication from top to bottom, mutual disclosure and sincerity, and joint consultation and mutual understanding and support between superiors and subordinates. In this way, the comrades working below felt more comfortable, and therefore had more enthusiasm and ideas; the comrades above also fully understood the situation and fully listened to the opinions of cadres at all levels below, thereby grasping the main contradictions in current production and the key to solving them. This kind of meeting is conducive to the "more thoughtful and decisive" decision-making of leading cadres, embodies the principle of making economic work more and more detailed, and at the same time ensures the real implementation of plans and measures.
    The five-level cadre meeting is still a budding new thing on the industrial front, a beginning of new things. We should continue to develop it and make it achieve greater results. It is recommended that all industrial departments, all provinces and cities, and all factories and mines hold such meetings to make our mass movement develop even better.

    工业界的新事
    华工
    最近冶金工业部召开的五级干部会，是工业界出现的一件新事。其所以是新事，因为过去在工业部门还没有开过像这样的从部的领导到车间工段干部都参加的会议。这种会议，是走群众路线的一个创造，是使群众运动和集中领导相结合的一种新的，比较好的方法。基层干部和广大职工群众有着极密切的联系，他们对于企业生产建设中的情况和问题以及广大职工群众的情绪和要求，都非常了解。部的领导干部同他们直接见面、开会，有助于深入地具体地掌握群众运动的呼吸和脉搏。
    群众运动和集中领导是相互依存、相互联结的两个方面，是对立的统一。中央关于领导方法的决定中说：“只有领导骨干的积极性，而无积极性相结合，便将成为少数人的空忙。但如果广大群众的只有广大群众的积极性，而无有力的领导骨干去恰当地组织群众的积极性，则群众积极性既不可能持久，也不可能走向正确的方向和提到高级的程度。”这几句话就充分地揭示了群众运动和集中领导之间的辩证关系。
    运动发展的规律，对立统一的两个方面，在一定的情况下，也有其主导的方面。当群众运动没有起来以前，领导工作主要就是放手发动群众；当群众运动已经广泛开展起来的情况之下，集中领导就成了主导方面。领导的艺术就在于抓住主导方面，加强主导方面，使群众运动和集中领导结合起来，推动群众运动不断前进。
    冶金部召开的五级干部会议，使部的领导干部了解了许多过去在一般两级干部会或三级干部会上难以了解到的更多更具体的情况，同时也使部的意图和计划一竿子插到底。这就真正作到了上下通气，上下交底交心，上下共同商量、上下互相体谅、互相支援。这样，下面的工作同志都感到心情舒畅了，因而干劲更大，主意更多了；上面的同志也因为充分了解了情况，充分听取了下面各级干部的意见，从而抓住了当前生产中的主要矛盾以及解决矛盾的关键。这种会议，有助于领导干部的“多谋善断”，体现了经济工作愈作愈细，同时保证了计划和措施真正落实。
    五级干部会，在工业战线上还是一件新事物的萌芽，新事物的开端，我们应当使它继续发展下去，使它收到更大的效果。建议各工业部门、各省市、各厂矿都召开这样的会议，使我们的群众运动发展得更好。
