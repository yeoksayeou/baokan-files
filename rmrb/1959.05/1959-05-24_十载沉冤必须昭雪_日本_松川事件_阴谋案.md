    A Decade of Injustice Must Be Redressed
    —The Japanese "Matsukawa Incident" Conspiracy Case
    The "Matsukawa Incident," a ten-year-old injustice, will be pronounced in the coming months. The broad masses of the Japanese people have persistently struggled for ten years, demanding the complete release of the innocent defendants in the "Matsukawa Incident."
    The "Matsukawa Incident" is a major injustice created single-handedly by the U.S.-Japan reactionaries. Ten years ago, in order to suppress the democratic and progressive forces in Japan, the U.S.-Japan reactionaries fabricated a train derailment incident near Matsukawa Station in Fukushima Prefecture on August 17, 1949, and then falsely accused Japanese communists of committing "atrocities." The Japanese police authorities arrested a nineteen-year-old young worker, Katsumi Akama, and after ten days of threats, enticements, and brutal torture, fabricated a so-called "Akama confession record." Based on this "confession," they arrested Shin Suzuki, chairman of the Fukushima branch of the National Railway Workers' Union, and ten other union cadres and members. At the same time, they arrested Saburo Sugiura, director of the Matsukawa branch of the Tokyo Shibaura Electric Company's union, and ten other union cadres. Most of these innocent arrestees were members of the Japanese Communist Party. In this way, the police authorities, under the fabricated charge of "conspiring to subvert the train," imprisoned them.
    Although the various charges imposed on the defendants were completely untenable, after ninety-five illegal trials, the Fukushima District Court illegally sentenced Shin Suzuki and five others to death, Hisashi Takeda and five others to life imprisonment, and the remaining ten to a total of ninety-five years and six months of imprisonment on December 6, 1950.
    The innocent defendants immediately appealed. The broad masses of the Japanese people expressed boundless anger and protest against this illegal verdict, demanding that the Sendai High Court uphold justice in the second instance. However, the U.S.-Japan reactionaries were still unwilling to give up. After more than one hundred trials, the Sendai High Court still sentenced four defendants to death, two to life imprisonment, and the remaining eleven to imprisonment for a fixed term in December 1953, with only three defendants being acquitted.
    The second instance verdict further enraged the broad masses of the Japanese people. The Japanese people have continuously carried out rescue struggles through meetings, demonstrations, and signature campaigns. More than 170 Japanese legal professionals participated in the lawyers' group to defend the defendants. Many trade union groups and people's organizations formed the "Matsukawa Incident On-site Investigation Team," which has conducted eight on-site investigations since 1956. On July 27, 1958, an investigation team composed of 380 people from 150 organizations conducted an on-site investigation. The National Relief Association mobilized more than 4,000 people to conduct the largest investigation in ten years. In March 1958, trade unions such as "Sohyo" and the Japan National Relief Association, as well as many people's organizations, formed the "Matsukawa Incident" Countermeasures Council to carry out rescue activities and issued appeals to more than 100 trade unions around the world. On August 17, a "International Action Day" to support the defendants in the "Matsukawa Incident" was held, receiving the support of the working class and all righteous people around the world.
    The Japanese Supreme Court, under pressure from the people's demands, decided to hold oral arguments on the "Matsukawa Incident" for about three weeks starting from November 5, 1958. Due to the increasingly fierce people's struggle and the strong pressure of public opinion, the Japanese judicial authorities began to grant bail to some defendants from the autumn of last year. So far, thirteen people have been released on bail, plus the three people acquitted in the second instance, totaling sixteen people released. Of the four still in prison, one has been granted short-term release due to illness. This is a major victory in the Japanese people's struggle to rescue the defendants in the "Matsukawa Incident"!
    This year, at the latest in September, the Japanese Supreme Court will announce the final verdict on the "Matsukawa Incident." Since the beginning of this year, people from all walks of life in Japan have intensified their rescue efforts by holding large-scale activities such as the "National Congress to Demand the Innocent Release of the Matsukawa Incident Defendants." Now, the U.S.-Japan reactionaries' conspiracy to persecute in the "Matsukawa Incident" has been completely bankrupted. A decade of injustice must be redressed, this is the common cry of the Japanese people and righteous humanity. (Feng)

    十载沉冤必须昭雪
    ——日本“松川事件”阴谋案
    十载冤狱的“松川事件”，将在今后几个月内宣判。广大日本人民十年来一直坚持不懈地进行斗争，要求全部释放“松川事件”无辜被告。
    “松川事件”是美日反动派一手制造的大冤狱。十年前，美日反动派为了镇压日本民主进步力量，于1949年8月17日在福岛县松川车站附近制造火车出轨事件，然后诬赖日本共产党人制造“暴行”。日本警察当局逮捕了一个十九岁的青年工人赤间胜美，经过十天的威胁、利诱、酷刑拷问，捏造了所谓“赤间口供笔录”，然后根据这篇“口供”，逮捕了国营铁道工会福岛分会会长铃木信等十名工会干部和会员，同时又逮捕了东京芝浦电气公司工会松川分会主任杉浦三郎等十名工会干部。这些无辜被捕者大多数是日共党员。就这样，警察当局以莫须有的“共谋颠复列车”罪名，使他们系身冤狱。
    虽然强加给被告的种种罪名根本不能成立，但经过九十五次非法审讯后，福岛地方裁判所竟然在1950年12月6日非法判处铃木信等五人死刑，武田久等五人无期徒刑，对其余十人则处以总计长达九十五年零六个月的有期徒刑。
    无辜被告立即提出上诉。日本广大人民对这一非法判决表示无比愤怒和抗议，要求仙台高等裁判所在第二审中维护正义。但是，美日反动派仍然不肯罢手。再经过一百多次审讯，1953年12月仙台高等裁判所竟仍判决四名被告死刑，二名无期徒刑，其余十一名被判有期徒刑，仅有三名被告被宣判无罪。
    第二审的判决更加激怒了日本广大人民。日本人民就不断以集会、游行示威、征集签名等方式进行营救斗争。日本法律工作者一百七十多人参加律师团为被告进行辩护。许多工会团体、人民团体组成了“松川事件现地调查团”，从1956年以来共进行过八次实地调查，1958年7月27日，一个由一百五十个团体共三百八十多人组成调查团进行现地调查。国民救援会更动员了四千多人进行十年来最大的一次调查。1958年3月“总评”等工会和日本国民救援会以及许多人民团体成了“松川事件”对策协议会，进行救援活动，并向全世界各国一百多个工会发出呼吁书，在8月17日举行支援“松川事件”被告“国际行动日”，得到了世界工人阶级和一切正义人士的支持。
    日本最高裁判所迫于人民的要求，决定在1958年11月5日起举行为期三周左右的“松川事件”口头辩论。由于人民斗争日益激烈和舆论的强大压力，日本司法当局从去年秋天起开始准予保释一些被告出狱。到目前为止被保释出狱的已有十三人，加上第二审判决无罪的三人，计有十六人出狱。而仍在狱中的四人中又有一人因病被准短期出狱。这是日本人民营救“松川事件”被告斗争的一大胜利！
    今年最迟在9月，日本最高裁判所就要对“松川事件”宣布最后判决。日本各界人民从今年年初以来就以召开“要求无罪释放松川事件无辜被告全国大会”等大规模的活动，加紧从事营救的斗争。现在，美日反动派制造“松川事件”的迫害阴谋，已经彻底破产。十载沉冤必须昭雪，这是日本人民和正义人类的共同呼声。　（峰）
