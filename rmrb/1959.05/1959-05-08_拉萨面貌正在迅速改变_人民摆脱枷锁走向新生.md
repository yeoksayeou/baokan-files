Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 7th. Our correspondent Zong Zidu reports: The face of Lhasa, the ancient city on the Tibetan plateau, is changing rapidly. The people are breaking free from the evil shackles of the serf system and moving towards a new life.

Before the rebellion was quelled, Lhasa, under the rule of the reactionary former Tibetan local government, was a city of commercial decay and soaring prices. Rebel leaders such as Sokang Wangqing Gele, Xiangka Jumei Dorje (Xiasu), and Chijiang Luosang Yexi purchased local products at low prices and transported them abroad, while at the same time selling foreign goods here at high prices to reap huge profits. Liu Xia Tudeng Taba built a cinema and showed Indian pornographic films, with a ticket price as high as thirty Tibetan silver taels (equivalent to two yuan in RMB). Due to the decline of production and economic bankruptcy in rural areas and pastures, impoverished farmers and herdsmen flowed into Lhasa in a constant stream. The number of slum tents in Lhasa increased to several hundred, and beggars and disabled people could be seen everywhere struggling on the verge of hunger and death. The fields in the suburbs were barren, and the canals were dry. Farmers, fearing the evildoing of the rebels, hid in their houses and dared not come out to cultivate the land.

Now, Lhasa is in an atmosphere of peace and new life. Merchants have guarantees for opening shops and doing business, children are studying peacefully in schools, lamas are carrying out normal religious activities, and in the evenings, citizens go to the People's Cinema (formerly Liu Xia's cinema) in groups to watch movies. The poor people who had been stranded in Lhasa have all received relief and assistance from the Lhasa Municipal Committee of the CPC and the Lhasa Military Control Commission. Those with labor power have been introduced to employment. On the various construction sites of the Lhasa Municipal Construction Engineering Office, there are already large numbers of new Tibetan workers happily working. In the past, they were called "untouchables" by the feudal rulers and had no right to make a living. Now, some of them have become carpenters, and some have become plasterers and bricklayers. Every evening after work, they often gather together to sing and dance.

In a small wooden house in the west of Lhasa city live two Tibetan elders, one is eighty-year-old Dawa Zeren, and the other is sixty-five-year-old Awang Zhaxi. For decades, they toiled and sweated for the serf owners, enduring beatings and humiliation. When they became old and frail, they were driven out of the manor by the serf owners. Before the Lhasa rebellion was quelled, Dawa Zeren and Awang Zhaxi wandered everywhere, begging for a living. After the rebellion was quelled, the Lhasa Military Control Commission helped them move from broken tents into new homes, and provided them with zanba, butter, and tea. The two old men, who had never known each other before, lived together, taking care of each other, and felt the warmth of life for the first time. Dawa Zeren stroked the whip marks on his body and said to the staff, "The Kasha (former Tibetan local government) made us suffer so much. We have finally obtained today's warm life and freedom. The imperialists and foreign reactionaries want to continue to let those reactionary guys ride on our heads forever. That can't be done."

A small incident can illustrate how eagerly the broad masses of oppressed people in Tibet demand liberation. Bubu Cangjin, a female slave in the family of Maya, a rebel aristocrat in Lhasa, was slapped twice by Maya's wife one morning more than ten days ago simply because she washed the dishes with hot water. Bubu Cangjin could no longer endure it, and she left Maya's house and went to the Military Control Commission to ask for a job. This twenty-year-old Tibetan girl couldn't help but shed tears of grief and indignation when she talked about the enslavement and suffering her family had endured in the past. She said, "If the People's Liberation Army hadn't quelled the Lhasa rebellion, there would have been no hope for a child from a poor family like me to have a bright future!" She also said, "When the Lhasa rebellion broke out, I secretly prayed in my heart for the victory of the People's Liberation Army." This is how the broad masses of oppressed people in Tibet view the Liberation Army.

In the vast fields outside Lhasa, the water is now gurgling. With the help of the working group of the Military Control Commission, the farmers have already sown wheat and peas and are rushing to plant highland barley. On the 5th, this reporter saw a group of ragged Tibetan people happily sowing seeds in a piece of farmland in the eastern suburbs of Lhasa. These were twenty-one poor people from the eastern district cultivating the land of the former Tibetan local government allocated by the Military Control Commission. This year, whoever cultivates these lands will harvest them, without paying grain or taxes. Pengcuo Lamu, their production captain, said: In the past, we poor people didn't even have a piece of land the size of a palm. Today, the Military Control Commission has given us land, provided seeds, and solved the difficulty of not having cattle. The residents of the eastern district also came to help us. In half a day, they transported a lot of manure to the fields. The benefits brought to us poor old folks by quelling the rebellion are too many to describe. (Attached picture)

### 拉萨面貌正在迅速改变  人民摆脱枷锁走向新生

　　拉萨面貌正在迅速改变  人民摆脱枷锁走向新生
    新华社拉萨7日电　本社记者宗子度报道：西藏高原古城拉萨的面貌正在迅速改变。人民正在摆脱农奴制的罪恶枷锁，走向新的生活。
    叛乱平息前，拉萨在反动的原西藏地方政府统治下，商业雕零，物价飞涨。索康·旺清格勒、先喀·居美多杰（夏苏）、赤江·罗桑益西等叛匪头子贱价收购土特产运往国外，同时贩卖外国货来这里高价出售，获取暴利。柳霞·土登塔巴修了一个电影院，放映印度黄色影片，一张电影票价高达藏银三十两（折合人民币两元）。由于农村、牧场生产衰颓、经济破产，贫苦农牧民源源流入拉萨，拉萨的贫民帐篷增加到好几百顶，街头巷尾到处都可以看见乞丐和残废者在饥寒和死亡的边缘上挣扎。郊区田地荒芜，水渠干涸，农民们怕叛匪作恶，躲在屋里不敢出来耕种。
    现在，拉萨市处在和平和新生的气氛中。商人们开店营业有了保障，儿童们安心地在学校里念书，喇嘛们在进行正常的宗教活动，晚上，市民们成群结队到人民电影院（原柳霞的电影院）去看电影。流落在拉萨的贫民们都得到了中共拉萨市委和拉萨市军管会的救济和帮助，有劳动力的一律介绍就业，在拉萨市建筑工程处的各个建筑工地上，已有这样的大批藏族新工人在愉快地劳动。他们过去被封建统治者叫做“贱民”，没有谋生的权利，现在他们有的成了木工、有的成了泥水工和砖瓦工。每天傍晚下工后，他们常常欢聚在一起唱歌跳舞。
    在拉萨城西的一间小木屋里居住着两个藏族老人，一个是八十岁的达娃泽仁，一个是六十五岁的阿旺扎西。他们几十年来为农奴主抛洒血汗，受尽了殴打和凌辱。当他们年老体衰的时候，就被农奴主从庄园里赶了出来。拉萨叛乱平息前，达娃泽仁和阿旺扎西到处流浪，乞讨为生。叛乱平息后，拉萨市军管会就帮助他们从破帐篷里搬入新居，发给他们糌粑、酥油和茶叶。两个过去素不相识的老人，合伙住在一起，彼此照顾，第一次感到了人生的温暖。达娃泽仁抚摩着他身上的鞭痕对工作人员说：“噶厦（原西藏地方政府）把我们害苦了，我们好容易得到今天的温暖生活和自由解放，帝国主义和外国反动派想继续叫那些反动家伙永远骑在我们头上，那可办不到。”
    有一件小事可以说明西藏广大受压迫的人民是怎样迫切要求解放。拉萨的一个叛乱分子、贵族马雅家里有一个女奴隶卜布仓金，十多天前的一个早上，她只是因为用热水洗了一次碗，马雅的老婆竟像过去那样打了她两个耳光。卜布仓金再也忍耐不住，她离开了马雅家跑到军管会要求介绍工作。这位二十岁的藏族姑娘谈起过去一家人所受的奴役和痛苦，就忍不住流下悲愤的眼泪。她说：“要不是人民解放军平息了拉萨叛乱，我这个穷苦人家的孩子一辈子那有出头的日子！”她还说：“当拉萨叛乱发生的时候，我心里就暗暗地祷告人民解放军胜利。”西藏广大受压迫的人民，就是这样来看待解放军的。
    拉萨郊外广阔的田野上现在流水淙淙，在军管会工作组的帮助下，农民们已经播种完了小麦和豌豆，正在抢种青稞。5日，记者在拉萨东郊看到一群衣衫褴褛的藏民，正兴高采烈地在一片耕地上播种。这是东区的二十一家贫民在耕种军管会拨给的原西藏地方政府的土地。他们今年耕种这些土地是谁种谁收，不纳粮，不上税。他们的生产队长彭错拉姆说：过去，我们这些穷人连巴掌大的一块地也没有，今天军管会给了地，还发给种籽，解决没有耕牛的困难。东区居民也都来帮助我们，半天光景，就给地里运来了很多粪肥，平息叛乱给我们穷苦老百姓带来的好处，说也说不完。（附图片）
