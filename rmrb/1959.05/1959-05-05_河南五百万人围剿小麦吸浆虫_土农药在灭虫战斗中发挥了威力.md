Henan: Five Million People Encircle and Suppress Wheat Sucking Thrips
Homemade Pesticides Demonstrate Power in Insect Extermination Battle

(According to Henan Daily) The first battle in Henan Province to encircle and suppress wheat sucking thrips has ended victoriously. According to preliminary statistics from the Agricultural, Forestry, and Water Conservancy Group of the Provincial Governor's Office, five million people participated in this wheat sucking thrips prevention and control campaign. Out of the more than 20 million mu of wheat fields where sucking thrips occurred, 17.15 million mu were universally sprayed with pesticides, of which 3.53 million mu were sprayed twice. The insecticidal effect was generally above 80%, with the best reaching above 95%. Under the slogan of "Fighting hard for three days and nights to wipe out sucking thrips in one fell swoop," Nanyang Prefecture mobilized 1.31 million people and used 11.88 million jin of pesticides to eliminate sucking thrips on 4.2 million mu of wheat fields, and 1.7 million mu of wheat fields were treated with "666" powder soil treatment. Leading cadres in many areas personally led the masses to control insects. Su Maocheng, Deputy County Head of Shangcai County, led 215 people to spray pesticides in the fields of Zhuli Commune, controlling 105 mu in half a day.

This wheat sucking thrips prevention and control campaign began on April 18th, fully unfolded on the 20th, and basically ended on the 24th. Prior to this, in order to quickly launch this campaign, command headquarters for eliminating wheat sucking thrips, headed by the Party Committee Secretary, were established from the province to the special districts, counties, and people's communes. They vigorously promoted pesticides and equipment, and widely established insect situation monitoring stations and points. According to incomplete statistics, the province established 8,000 temporary insect situation monitoring stations and points, trained 200,000 peasant technicians, prepared nearly 8 million pieces of insecticidal equipment (dusters, cloth bags, bellows), and 3 million jin of "666" powder. On the night of the 22nd, Zhenping County transported all 148,000 jin of existing pesticides to the communes. Some members of the Fourth Production Team of the Balipeng Brigade of the Sanposi Commune in Huangchuan County did not believe there were insects. The team organized them to visit the wheat fields. When they opened the wheat furrows and saw one or twenty insects at a glance, their paralysis was swept away. Team member Hu Youde of the Wuzhai Detachment said, "We have to treat them. Last year, in our team, one piece of wheat, the south side was treated and yielded 485 jin per mu, while the north side was not treated and only yielded 125 jin per mu." On that day, more than 160 laborers in this team invested in the preparation work for treating sucking thrips. The brigade promoted the Fourth Production Team's experience in mobilizing the masses, and 80% of the team's labor force took action, preparing 180 bed sheets, 224 white cloth bags, 145 sock covers, and four dusters in one day.

Homemade pesticides played a powerful role in eliminating wheat sucking thrips. Various regions have created some effective homemade pesticides for treating sucking thrips. The masses in Tanghe County used three jin of Toona sinensis root, one jin of cotton strips, half a jin of "cat's eyes" (likely a local plant name), one and a half jin of tobacco leaves, added 50 jin of water, boiled for half an hour, removed the residue, and then added 100 jin of water to spray and treat sucking thrips, with an insecticidal efficiency of over 90%. Gucheng Brigade of Sanposi Commune in Huangchuan County used "cat's eyes," mulberry root, Stinkweed root, locust root, sweet thorn buds, old alum, Headacheroot, Monkeygrass, bitter vegetable root, Toona root, bark root, Gleditsia sinensis thorns, etc., to prepare a homemade pesticide, boiling seven jin with 100 jin of water for seven hours, then taking it out and diluting it with another 100 jin of water before applying it. The insecticidal effect was very good. These homemade pesticides are low in cost and simple to manufacture, effectively making up for the shortage of foreign medicines.

In order to ensure quality and avoid pesticide damage, many areas have established necessary pest control organizations and stipulated insect control disciplines. In the Nanyang Prefecture, communes and teams organized drug transportation teams, combat teams, insect situation inspection teams, and acceptance teams, each responsible for their own tasks. At the height of the wheat sucking thrips eradication campaign, 180,000 mu in the district were found to be treated substandardly and were re-treated the next day. (Attached picture)

    河南五百万人围剿小麦吸浆虫
    土农药在灭虫战斗中发挥了威力
    据河南日报消息　河南全省围剿小麦吸浆虫的第一次战斗已胜利结束。据省长办公室农林水利组初步统计，参加这次防治小麦吸浆虫运动的有五百万人；发生吸浆虫的两千余万亩麦田，有一千七百一十五万亩普遍喷撒了药剂，其中有三百五十三万亩喷撒了两遍药剂。杀虫效果一般在80％以上，最好的在95％以上。南阳专区在“苦战三昼夜，一鼓歼灭吸浆虫”的口号推动下，出动一百三十一万人，使用农药一千一百八十八万斤，消灭了四百二十万亩麦田的吸浆虫，并有一百七十万亩麦田进行“六六六”粉土壤处理。许多地区的领导干部亲自带领群众治虫。上蔡县副县长苏茂成在朱里公社带领二百一十五人下地喷药，半天防治一百零五亩。
    这次防治小麦吸浆虫运动是4月18日开始的，20日全面铺开，24日基本结束。在这以前，为使这个运动迅速开展，从省到各专、县和人民公社，都建立了以党委书记为首的消灭小麦吸浆虫指挥部，大搞农药、器械，广泛设置了虫情测报站、测报点。据不完全统计，全省建立八千个临时虫情测报站、点，训练农民技术员二十万人，准备杀虫器械近八百万件（喷粉器、布袋、风箱），“六六六”粉三百万斤。镇平县22日夜，把现存农药十四万八千斤，全部运到公社。潢川县伞陂寺公社八里棚大队第四生产队，有些队员不相信有虫，队里组织他们到麦田里参观，当他们扒开麦垅，一眼就能看到一、二十个虫时，麻痹思想扫除了。五寨分队队员胡友德说：“就得治。去年俺队一块麦子，南面经过防治，每亩收麦四百八十五斤，北面没有防治，每亩只收一百二十五斤。”这个队当天有一百六十多个劳力投入治吸浆虫准备工作。大队推广第四生产队发动群众的经验，全队有80％的劳力行动起来，一天准备好一百八十条被单，二百二十四个白布袋，一百四十五个袜套，四部喷粉器。
    土农药在消灭小麦吸浆虫中发挥了威力。各地都创造了一些治吸浆虫有效的土农药。唐河县群众用栋树根三斤，棉花条一斤，猫儿眼半斤，烟叶一斤半，加水五十斤，煮沸半小时后，除去渣滓，再加水一百斤，用来喷治吸浆虫，杀虫效率在90％以上。潢川县伞陂寺公社古城大队用猫儿眼、桑树根、臭皮草根、槐树根、甜刺芽、老鸦矾、头疼花根、猴儿草、苦菜根、栋根、皮树根、皂角刺等配一种土农药，每七斤兑百斤水一块熬，七小时后取出，兑百斤水，就可施用，杀虫效果很好。这些土农药成本低，制造方法简单，有力地弥补了洋药不足。
    为了保证质量，避免药害，很多地区都建立了必要的除虫组织，规定了治虫纪律。南阳专区各地社、队组织了运药队、战斗队、虫情检查队、验收队，分工负责；消灭小麦吸浆虫运动高潮时，全区发现有十八万亩治的不合规格，第二天又都重新治了一遍。（附图片）
