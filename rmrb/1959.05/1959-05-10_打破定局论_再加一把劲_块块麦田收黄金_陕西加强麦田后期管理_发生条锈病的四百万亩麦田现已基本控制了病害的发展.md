　　Break with Fatalism, Redouble Efforts, Reap Golden Harvests from Every Field:
    Shaanxi Strengthens Late-Stage Wheat Field Management
    Stripe Rust Disease in Four Million Mu of Wheat Fields Now Basically Under Control
    (Our dispatch from Xi'an, 9th) A production upsurge centered on preventing and controlling wheat diseases and pests in late-stage wheat field management has emerged in various parts of Shaanxi Province. Currently, the province is carrying out large-scale prevention and control of stripe rust and wheat blossom midges. As of recently, the four million mu of wheat fields in the province affected by stripe rust have all been treated once or twice, and the severely affected wheat fields have been treated more than ten times in succession, basically controlling the development of stripe rust. The one million and eighty thousand mu of wheat fields affected by wheat blossom midges have also all been treated once.
    Last winter and this spring in Shaanxi Province, the weather was relatively warm, with abundant rainfall and high temperatures, which was conducive to the development of stripe rust. Stripe rust was rampant for a time. However, thanks to the timely prevention and control by the people of the province, coupled with the recent relatively dry weather, which is unfavorable to the development of stripe rust, stripe rust has not caused major losses and is the least affected year in recent years. During the period when stripe rust was rampant, the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Provincial People's Committee held several telephone conferences in succession, issued special instructions, and sent responsible cadres to seriously affected areas to supervise the battle. Party secretaries of various counties and people's communes took the lead and divided up areas with individual responsibility. Many counties and people's communes also launched mutual supervision. For example, in Weinan County, along the south bank of the Wei River, several hundred mu of land were not treated. Dali County, on the opposite bank of the Wei River, promptly sent people to the county to supervise the prevention and control. Xingping County and Zhouzhi County, whose cultivated land is adjacent, supervised each other's stripe rust prevention and control work.
    Under the leadership of party committees at all levels, the members of the broad masses of people's communes launched a fierce battle against stripe rust. Chang'an County recently mobilized more than 20,000 laborers and more than 6,600 sprayers to spray all 110,000 mu of wheat fields affected by stripe rust. Zhouzhi, Qianxian, and Fengxiang counties had more serious stripe rust. These three counties dispatched 160,000 prevention and control troops every day, along with three aircraft, and with the help of the Shaanxi Branch of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences and other units, adopted joint land-air operations. After continuous prevention and control, the spread of the disease has been basically controlled. Now, they are taking further measures to strive to prevent stripe rust from reducing wheat production. People's communes in various places attach great importance to the effectiveness of prevention and control and have generally formulated strict acceptance systems. The Jiajia Village Production Team of the Hengqu People's Commune in Zhouzhi County reworked the fields eight times due to incomplete prevention and control, and only passed the acceptance inspection on the last attempt.
    Shaanxi Province's method of preventing and controlling stripe rust is a combination of indigenous and foreign methods, and different strategies are adopted according to different situations. In areas where the disease is serious and transmission bases have formed, soil burial and leaf cutting or spraying with ammonium sulfate water, superphosphate water, etc., are used to kill the bacteria. In areas where the disease is relatively serious and disease centers have formed, in addition to the above methods, protective agents (such as raw urine, cat's eye, salt water, etc.) are sprayed. In areas where the disease occurs universally but no disease center has yet formed, protective agents are mainly sprayed. In addition, in areas where no diseased leaves have been found but are close to diseased leaves, protective agents are generally sprayed in a belt one to two zhang wide to prevent the invasion of bacteria. Due to insufficient medicines and machinery, local pesticides and tools were used in large quantities. In Zhouzhi, Fengxiang and other counties alone, according to incomplete statistics, more than 50 million jin of local pesticides and more than 40,000 pieces of various application tools were manufactured. In terms of prevention and control technology, various places have also explored some experiences, which can be summarized in nine characters: shovel (remove weeds), bury (bury soil and cut leaves), irrigate (water), chop (chop fine grass), burn (fumigate and kill), seal (seal firewood and warehouses), spray (spray medicinal powder), scald (scald with boiling water), mix (mix seeds with medicine).
    This year, the occurrence of wheat blossom midges in Shaanxi Province is less severe than in previous years. However, the people of the province are vigorously eliminating wheat blossom midges and preventing their spread, just as they attach importance to the prevention and control of stripe rust. According to statistics from eight counties including Chang'an, Huxian, and Lintong, 1.02 million mu have been treated for wheat blossom midges. Including the area for prevention, the province has now treated approximately 1.4 million mu.
    In order to further strengthen the work of preventing and controlling diseases and insect pests, relevant departments in Shaanxi recently issued a notice, requiring the entire party and all people to take action and launch another surprise campaign to prevent and control diseases and insect pests.
    The more than 20 million mu of wheat fields in Shaanxi Province are generally growing well. As long as late-stage management is continued and there are no unexpected severe disasters, this year's wheat season will be more abundant than last year.

### 打破定局论　再加一把劲　块块麦田收黄金  陕西加强麦田后期管理  发生条锈病的四百万亩麦田现已基本控制了病害的发展

　　打破定局论　再加一把劲　块块麦田收黄金
    陕西加强麦田后期管理
    发生条锈病的四百万亩麦田现已基本控制了病害的发展
    本报西安9日电　陕西省各地出现了一个以防治小麦病虫害为中心的麦田后期管理的生产高潮。目前，全省正在大规模地进行防治条锈病和吸浆虫。截至最近，全省四百万亩发生条锈病的麦田已全部防治了一遍到两遍，发病严重的麦田，连续防治十遍以上，基本上控制了条锈病的发展；一百零八万亩麦田发生了吸浆虫，也全部防治了一遍。
    陕西省去冬今春天气较暖，雨量多，温度大，适宜于条锈病的发展，条锈病曾经猖獗一时。但是，由于全省人民防治及时，加之最近天气比较干燥，不利条锈病的发展，因此条锈病未造成重大损失，并且是近几年来受害最轻的一年。在条锈病发展猖獗时期，中共陕西省委和省人民委员会曾经连续召开了几次电话会议，印发了专门指示；派出负责干部深入条锈病严重地区督战。各县和各人民公社都由党委书记挂帅，划片包干。许多县和人民公社互相间还展开了监督。例如沿渭河南岸的渭南县，有几百亩地没有防治，渭河对岸的大荔县便及时派人到该县督促防治。兴平县和盩厔县耕地毗连，两县便互相监督条锈病的防治工作。
    在各级党委的领导下，广大人民公社的社员们，和条锈病展开了激战。长安县最近曾动员了两万多个劳力、六千六百多架喷雾器，把十一万亩发生条锈病的麦田，全部喷了药。盩厔、乾县、凤翔三县条锈病比较严重，这三个县每天就出动十六万防治大军，三架飞机，在中国农业科学院陕西分院等单位的帮助下，采取陆空军联合作战。经过连续防治，基本上控制了病情蔓延。现在，他们正在进一步采取措施，力争不因条锈病而使小麦减产。各地人民公社很重视防治效果，普遍制订了严格的验收制度，盩厔县横渠人民公社贾家村生产队，因防治不彻底，曾经八次返工，最后一次才验收合格。
    陕西省防治条锈病的方法是土洋结合，根据不同情况，采取不同对策。凡发病严重、形成传病基地地区，采用埋土切叶或用硫铵水、过磷酸钙水等喷洒，以杀伤病菌。凡发病较重、形成发病中心地区，除采用上述办法外，结合喷洒保护剂（如生尿水、猫儿眼、食盐水等）。对于普遍发生病害、尚未形成发病中心的地区，主要喷洒保护剂。此外，对于虽然没有发生病叶但离发病叶片较近地区，一般在一丈到两丈宽的地带喷洒保护剂，预防病菌侵入。药械农药不足，各地大量地采用了土农药和土药械，仅盩厔、凤翔等县不完全统计，自制土农药五千多万斤，各种施药工具四万多件。在防治技术上各地也摸索出了一些经验，归纳起来有九个字：铲（铲除杂草）、埋（埋土切叶）、灌（浇水）、铡（铡碎细草）、烧（熏杀）、封（封闭柴草、仓库）、喷（喷洒药粉）、烫（用开水烫）、拌（药剂拌种）。
    今年，陕西省吸浆虫发生的情况比往年轻。但是，全省人民像重视防治条锈病那样，正在大力扑灭吸浆虫，防止传播。据长安、鄠县、临潼等八个县的统计，已防治吸浆虫一百零二万亩，如果包括预防面积，全省现在已防治一百四十万亩左右。
    为了进一步加强防治病虫害的工作，陕西有关部门最近发出通知，要求全党全民动手，再开展一次防治病虫害的突击运动。
    陕西省二千多万亩麦田普遍生长良好，只要继续加强后期管理，不遭受意外的严重灾害，今年麦季将比去年获得更大的丰收。
