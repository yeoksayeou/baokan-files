    Greetings to Chinese Worker Brothers
    We Will Excellently Manufacture Boilers for China
    Mikhaila Ivan, Work Team Leader and Advanced Worker of the Boiler Manufacturing Workshop, "Mao Zedong" Factory, Bucharest, Romania
    I am the work team leader of the steam boiler manufacturing workshop at the "Mao Zedong" Factory in Bucharest. Our workshop has manufactured thirty large boilers for the Chinese people from 1956 to the present. I feel very lucky and proud to be able to lead this work that embodies Romanian-Chinese friendship.
    I was born in 1913 in a poor peasant family in Vasilesdi Township, Bucharest. Due to the hardships of life, I entered a factory at the age of thirteen, and I had to sell more than ten hours of labor to the capitalists every day to make a living. In the dark days before liberation, we Romanian workers suffered exploitation and humiliation from the factory owners. At that time, although I was young and didn't understand any revolutionary principles, poverty and hunger made me understand a truth: workers could not gain freedom and happiness without overthrowing the reactionary rule and the capitalists. Therefore, at that time, I also actively participated in the ranks of strikes.
    I joined the Party in 1945. The Party cultivated me into a work team leader leading eighty workers. In recent years, our work team has been able to over fulfill the production tasks by about 20% due to selfless labor, and the product quality is also very good. We attach great importance to technological innovation in our work, and we have fully automated the heavy welding work, greatly reducing physical labor. In the heated socialist labor competition movement, the productivity of our team has increased by 20% compared with last year. It took us 112 days to build a large boiler in 1956, but now it only takes 90 days, and we are striving to reduce it to 70 days. Mutual assistance and cooperation have become a common practice in our team, and veteran workers often help young workers improve their skills. Now all the workers in our team have become skilled workers. Due to the above reasons, our work team is one of the advanced collectives in the factory, and there are six advanced workers in the entire team. From 1949 to the present, I have received a Labor Medal awarded by the state and two medals awarded by the factory.
    In order to welcome the great "May Day" festival, all the workers in our work team decided to manufacture two large boilers for China five days ahead of schedule. In the future, we will continue to excellently complete the glorious task of manufacturing boilers for the Chinese people under the conditions of ensuring quality and speed. We congratulate the Chinese worker brothers on their brilliant achievements in their work, and we will strengthen the friendship between the Romanian and Chinese people by strengthening the work in our own positions, and jointly fight for world peace.

### 向中国工人兄弟贺节  我们要出色地为中国造锅炉

    向中国工人兄弟贺节
    我们要出色地为中国造锅炉
    罗马尼亚布加勒斯特“毛泽东”工厂锅炉制造车间工作队长、先进工作者  米哈伊拉·伊万
    我是布加勒斯特“毛泽东”工厂蒸汽锅炉制造车间的工作队长。我们的车间从1956年到现在已经为中国人民制造了三十个大型锅炉。我能够领导这项体现罗中友谊的工作，感到十分幸运和骄傲。
    我在1913年出生在布加勒斯特州瓦西莱斯底乡的一个贫农家里。由于生活的逼迫，我在十三岁时就进了工厂，为了糊口，我不得不每天向资本家出卖十几个小时的劳动。在解放前的黑暗年代中，我们罗马尼亚的工人受尽了工厂主的剥削和凌辱。那时，我虽然由于年青还不懂什么革命道理，但贫穷和饥饿使我懂得了一条真理，那就是：不打倒反动统治和资本家，工人休想获得自由和幸福。因此，那时候我也积极地参加到罢工斗争的行列。
    我在1945年入了党。党把我培养成为一个领导八十名工人的工作队长。最近几年来，我们的工作队由于进行了忘我劳动，经常能够超计划20％左右完成生产任务，而且产品质量也很好。我们在工作方面非常重视技术改革，我们已使繁重的焊接工作全部自动化，大大减轻了体力劳动。在热烈的社会主义劳动竞赛运动中，我们队的生产率比去年提高了20％。我们在1956年造一个大型锅炉需要一百一十二天，现在只需九十天，我们正在争取减少到七十天。在我们队内互助合作已成为风气，老工人经常帮助青年工人提高技术。现在我们队的工人已经全部成为熟练工人了。由于上面这些原因，我们的工作队是厂内的先进集体之一，全队有六名先进工作者。我从1949年到现在获得国家颁发的一枚劳动奖章和工厂发给的两枚奖章。
    为了迎接伟大的“五一”节，我们工作队的全体工人决定提前五天给中国造出两个大型锅炉。今后，我们将继续在保证质量、保证速度的条件下，出色地完成为中国人民制造锅炉的光荣任务。我们祝贺中国工人弟兄在工作中取得辉煌成就，我们将通过加强自己岗位上的工作来加强罗中两国人民的友谊，共同为世界和平而斗争。
