    Quick Steaming Noodle Furnace
    The Tongxing Restaurant in the Qingshan District of Wuhan has built a large-scale quick steaming noodle furnace. Originally, two people could only make 400 catties of rice noodle sheets per day, and one catty of rice noodle sheets consumed one catty of coal, sometimes even more. Now, with three or four people operating it, they can produce more than 1,500 catties of rice noodle sheets per day, using only more than 300 catties of coal, saving more than 30,000 catties of coal per month.
    This furnace can not only steam rice noodles but also steam rice, steam rice cakes, and steam steamed buns, anything that needs to be steamed can be done with it.

    快速蒸粉炉
    武汉市青山区同兴餐馆建成了一座大型快速蒸粉炉，原来两人每天只能做四百斤粉皮，一斤粉皮要耗煤一斤，有时还超过。现在三人或四人操作，一天能生产粉皮一千五百余斤，只要三百多斤煤，每月可节约用煤三万余斤。
    这座炉不仅可以蒸粉，也可以蒸饭、蒸发糕、蒸包子，凡是蒸的都可以用。
