Top News Story (Short Story)
Heilongjiang, Mudanjiang City, Qiao Chuan

Since the Great Leap Forward, our postmen here have been like this: at the first hint of dawn, whether you're awake or not, they slip the newspaper through the door. Since the Great Leap Forward, Director Liang has had a habit: he wakes up when the newspaper hits the floor. He picks up the newspaper and first looks at the People's Daily headlines, then at the city newspaper. But in recent months, he's changed the order in which he reads the newspaper: he looks at the city newspaper first; and he looks at a small column on the second page first. It publishes the progress of each factory in meeting its targets every day. He points his finger at the factory names, moving down the list, and after finding the Red Star Machinery Factory, he looks at its ranking.

In mid-March, the Municipal Party Committee held a city-wide factory competition mobilization meeting. Before the meeting, the factory made full preparations, carefully calculated all aspects, and adopted more than a dozen measures that would allow the first quarter production targets to be completed five days ahead of schedule. At the meeting, Director Liang's speech shook the audience. Because no factory had yet proposed completing the first quarter production plan five days ahead of schedule. As soon as he stepped down from the stage, he was surrounded by two reporters. One asked about measures, the other asked about methods. The city newspaper reporter, short Old Yu, was the most persistent. He even asked how many hours the director slept each night. Director Liang spent half an hour answering their questions.

The next day, the headline on the second page of the newspaper announced the news that the Red Star Machinery Factory planned to complete the first quarter plan five days ahead of schedule. This further boosted the enthusiasm of all the workers. From that day on, the Red Star Machinery Factory was at the top of the list in the second-page column.

Yesterday, they received a challenge letter from the Tool Factory. It said that they would surpass the Red Star Machinery Factory in the second quarter. Director Liang was a little worried. Because the two factories had always been neck and neck in completing their plans in the past. They held a cadre meeting overnight and thoroughly studied ways to prevent the Tool Factory from overtaking them. The meeting ended at 11 p.m. After the meeting, Director Liang and Party Secretary Old He played a game of chess, and it was after twelve o'clock when he went to bed.

This morning, as usual, he woke up when the newspaper arrived. He opened the newspaper and was stunned. The first place was the Tool Factory, and the second place was the Red Star Machinery Factory. The difference in the percentage of completion of the plan was very large.

"What the hell!" He said to himself as he dressed, "Are you all gods?" He got dressed, brushed his teeth, and washed his face, and hurried to the factory. His wife kept calling him to eat breakfast, but he didn't hear her at all.

Party Secretary Old He was washing his face. When he saw Director Liang rushing in, he smiled and said, "Oh, the person who was looking for you just left, and you're already here."

"I think the newspaper made a mistake with the numbers." Director Liang handed the newspaper to Secretary He.

"I've seen it, there won't be a mistake." Secretary He took the washbasin off the chair, then wiped the chair and pushed it to Director Liang, saying, "I'm talking about something else. Just now, the Party Secretary of the Tool Factory, Old Liu, called to say that they had just received a new task to produce several large precision machine tools. It is said to be of international significance and must be delivered to Beijing before May 1st. Now everything is ready, except... the design strength. They plan to borrow a designer and three eighth-grade machinists from us. What to do?"

"Borrow from us?" Director Liang frowned.

"Yes, from us."

Director Liang pondered for a while: "We are in a competition. Now we are already behind, if we support them again..." He also knew that this idea was unspeakable, but in fact, none of the factory's designers could be spared. "Wasn't it at last night's meeting that we felt our design strength was lacking?" he said.

"Yes, but wasn't it because you were reluctant to give up that top cannon that you lost the whole game of chess last night?"

"This..." Director Liang paused after saying a word. He blushed when he heard Secretary He's words, and then smiled. "Okay, I have an idea," Director Liang stopped for a while and said in a low voice as if he was saying something secret: "For the sake of a game of chess, in order not to affect our production, I can barely act as a designer."

"If I had your skills, I would go too." Secretary He said with a smile, "Old Liu will definitely 'worship' you, they just want to get a capable person. Alas, your main task is to carry out large-scale collaboration, and also, incidentally, to do some 'side business', to see how they run ahead of us."

"Wonderful!" Director Liang clapped his hands and said.

"Knock, knock, knock," reporter Old Yu appeared at the door with a knock. He looked very anxious, covered in sweat. The director glanced at the Party Secretary and said, "These reporters really have a way, they can find you no matter where you run to."

"This time you've come at an inopportune time, our director is about to go to support the Tool Factory," Secretary He waved his hand, "You won't be able to grab the headline this time, go back and report empty-handed."

"The director is going to carry out large-scale collaboration?" Old Yu asked seriously.

"Yes..." The secretary explained the details one by one, and Old Yu immediately raised his voice and said, "Great, report it, report it. My Secretary He, this is the best headline news." Saying that, he took out a notebook from his pocket....

    头条消息（小小说）
    黑龙江牡丹江市　乔川
    大跃进以来，我们这儿的邮递员一直是这样：天刚蒙蒙亮，不管你起床没起床，他就把报纸从门缝塞进来。大跃进以来，梁厂长就有了这么个习惯：报纸一掉在地上他就醒。他拿起报纸先看人民日报大标题，然后看市报。可是最近几个月，他看报纸的顺序改变了：先看市报；而且是先看二版上的一个小专栏。那里每天都发表各厂完成指标的情况。他用手指着厂名一格格向下找，找到红星机械厂之后，再看旁边的顺位。
    3月中旬，市委召开了一个全市厂际竞赛动员大会。会前厂里作了充分准备，算了各方面的细账，采取了十几项措施，可以使第一季度生产指标提前五天完成。在大会上，梁厂长的发言震动了全场。因为还没有一个厂提出提前五天完成第一季度生产计划的。他一下台就被两个记者围上了。这个问措施，那个问办法。市报记者小个子老于最能追根问底。甚至连厂长每晚睡几个小时觉都问到了。梁厂长费了半个小时的时间才回答完了他们的问题。
    第二天，报纸的二版头条登出了红星机械厂计划提前五天完成第一季度计划的消息。这一下子更鼓起了全体职工的干劲。从那天开始，红星机械厂就在二版专栏里名列前茅了。
    昨天，他们接到工具厂一份挑战书。说是要在第二季度赶过红星机械厂。梁厂长有些担心。因为他们两个厂过去一直是在完成计划上相持不下的。他们连夜召开了一个干部会，彻底研究了不让工具厂压过去的办法。开完会已经夜十一点了。散会后，梁厂长又和党委书记老何下了一盘象棋，睡觉时，就在十二点以后了。
    今天早晨照例在报纸送来的时候醒了。他打开报纸一看，楞住了。第一位是工具厂，第二位才是红星机械厂。完成计划百分率的差数很悬殊。
    “出鬼了！”他一边穿衣服，一边自言自语地说：“你们都是神仙吗？”他穿好衣服，只刷了刷牙，洗了洗脸，就向厂子奔去。爱人在后边只管喊他吃饭，他都根本没听见。
    党委书记老何正在洗脸，一见梁厂长气吁吁地进来，就笑着说：“嗬，去找你的人刚走，你就来了。”
    “我看是报社把数字搞错了。”梁厂长把手里的报纸递给何书记说。
    “这个我看过了，不会搞错的。”何书记把脸盆从椅子上端下来，然后把椅子擦了擦推给梁厂长说：“我说的是另外一件事。刚才工具厂党委书记老刘打电话来说，他们新接到一项生产几台大型精密机床的任务。据说有国际意义，必须在‘五一’前送到北京。现在万事俱备，只欠……设计力量。打算向咱们借一位设计师和三名八级车工。怎么办？”
    “向咱们借？”梁厂长皱着眉头说。
    “对，向咱们。”
    梁厂长沉思了一会：“我们在搞竞赛。现在就已经落后了，如果再支援他们……”他也知道这种想法是见不得人的，但事实上厂里几名设计师没一个能抽出来。“昨晚的会上不就是感到我们的设计力量缺乏吗？”他说。
    “是啊，可是昨晚咱俩最后那局棋不就是因为你舍不得那个顶头炮才输了全盘棋吗？”
    “这……”梁厂长刚说出一个字就停住了。他听了何书记那句话先脸一红，然后笑了。“好，有了，”梁厂长停了会像说什么秘密似的小声说：“为了一盘棋，为了不影响咱们的生产，我还可以马马虎虎顶个设计师用。”
    “如果我有你那两下子我也去。”何书记笑迷迷地说，“老刘非把你‘供’起来不可，他们就希望去干将。唉，你去主要是搞大协作，另外，捎带搞点‘副业’，看看他们怎样跑在咱们前边去的。”
    “妙！”梁厂长两手一拍说。
    “嘭嘭嘭”，随着叩门声记者老于出现在门口了。看样子挺着急，满头大汗。厂长看了一眼党委书记说：“他们作记者的真有办法，任你跑到天涯海角也能把你找到。”
    “这回你来得可不凑巧，我们厂长马上要去支援工具厂，”何书记摆了摆手，“你这回抢不到头条了，空手回去报账吧。”
    “厂长出马搞大协作？”老于认真地问。
    “对……”书记把详细情况一五一十地讲了一遍，老于马上提高嗓门说：“好嘛，要报，要报。我的何书记，这就是最好的头条消息。”说着从衣袋里掏出笔记本来。……
