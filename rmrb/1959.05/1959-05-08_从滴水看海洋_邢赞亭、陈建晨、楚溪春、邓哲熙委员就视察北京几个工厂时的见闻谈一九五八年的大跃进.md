Chairman, fellow committee members:

We wholeheartedly support Premier Zhou's Government Work Report delivered at the Second National People's Congress, as well as the reports given by Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian. We fully agree with Vice Chairman Peng Zhen's report on the work of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and Vice Chairman Li Weihan's report on the work of the Standing Committee at the CPPCC meeting.

The Great Leap Forward is an Inevitable Trend in the Economic Development of Socialist Countries

Through studying the Government Work Report and combining it with our actual inspections in Beijing, we are extremely excited about the glorious achievements of China's comprehensive Great Leap Forward in 1958! We have achieved unprecedented bumper harvests of agricultural products; industry and transportation have leaped forward across the board; culture, education, scientific research, and healthcare have developed greatly; the movement of people's communes has been universally launched in the rural areas nationwide, and it has already demonstrated unparalleled superiority; through the anti-rightist struggle and the rectification movement, the socialist consciousness of the people nationwide has been greatly enhanced. All of this has prepared the material and spiritual conditions for China to rapidly build socialism and carry out communist construction, and has accumulated very rich experience. China's 1959 national economic plan is proposed on this basis. This plan is very grand and arduous. However, because our country has the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the organizer and inspirer of all ethnic groups in the country; has an incomparably superior socialist system; and has the radiant general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, our hardworking and brave people will certainly be able to strive to complete and overfulfill the grand plan of 1959, forming a greater, better, and more comprehensive Great Leap Forward than in 1958!

Our unwavering confidence is by no means a fantasy, nor is it an exaggeration, but is based on sufficient facts. Let us take the bits and pieces we saw in Beijing as examples.

Although Beijing is a political and cultural center with a long history, its industrial base was established during the comprehensive Great Leap Forward of 1958. Therefore, most of the factories are newly built or rebuilt. To date, most factories are still in the process of construction and production, but they have created tremendous achievements under the conditions of incomplete equipment, weak technical force, and insufficient supply of raw materials. The output value in 1958 exceeded more than double that of 1957. This year, it overfulfilled the task for the first quarter with a 107 percent achievement. This undeniable fact can be seen more clearly from the following factories of different types and sizes.

Beijing has an electrical appliance factory, which is one of the key industries. With the selfless assistance of the Soviet Union, it was built into a factory with the world's first-class and latest technology. During the Great Leap Forward in 1958, all the staff and workers of the factory closely relied on the leadership of the Party, launched mass movements in a big way, established a daring and collaborative communist style, and strengthened organizational work. In order to give play to the role of key industries, they carried out technical revolution in a big way, and based on China's specific conditions, made some improvements on the basis of advanced technology, greatly improving labor efficiency. In 1958, they completed the tasks that were originally planned to be completed by 1962 ahead of schedule, and have already produced ultra-small tubes and semiconductors that were not included in the original plan. This year's plan has been determined by the workers through research and discussion: the output will double last year's, which is 1.5 times the original plan; the output value will double and a half; the product will increase by 82 percent; and labor efficiency will increase by 96 percent on the basis of technological improvement. At present, all the staff and workers of the factory are launching a "three-high" red flag competition with soaring enthusiasm, and are fighting with full confidence to complete and overfulfill the tasks of 1959.

The Beijing Motor Factory started construction during the Great Leap Forward in 1958 and was only partially put into production in the middle of November. Up to now, it is still using sheds as offices, the equipment is less than 10 percent complete, and the supply of raw materials is insufficient. Only one-third of the quarterly plan was completed in January and February of this year. However, due to relying on the leadership of the Party, launching mass movements in a big way, carrying out technical revolution in a big way, strengthening organizational work, making overall arrangements, and giving play to the spirit of great collaboration, self-made machine tools were used to increase the self-sufficiency rate of equipment. While reducing physical labor, labor efficiency was greatly improved. Therefore, in the efforts of March, it overfulfilled the task for the first quarter. This is why all the staff and workers, with unwavering confidence, determined the production task for this year to be 400,000 kilowatts for motors and 30,000 kilowatts for generators, greatly breaking through the original plan of producing 60,000 kilowatts by 1960.

During the nationwide campaign to run industries last year, the Chunshu Hutong in Xuanwu District of Beijing, emerged with a privately run glass instrument factory set up by more than 100 people. Starting from November last year to now, it has developed into a factory with more than 300 workers. In March of this year, it produced 800,000 ampoules and 200,000 test tubes, which is more than double the 400,000 to 500,000 pieces produced in Beijing in the whole year before liberation. At present, it is moving towards the direction of foreign production through the process of combining indigenous and foreign methods. The Dongfeng Toy Factory in Dongcheng District was started by thirteen housewives in August and September last year to learn and trial-produce, and was established at the end of the year. It is a factory specializing in manufacturing dolls for export. It now has more than 170 workers. Although it is completely operated manually, it is a new type of production unit that implements the combination of labor production and education and has good organization and discipline. The production plan for April this year will increase by 50 percent compared to March.

The farm tool repair factory of the Zhoukoudian Changgou People's Commune was built last year during the severe cold of icy and snowy weather. Although the factory building is very simple, it already has a sand casting workshop. Up to now, in addition to repairing farm tools, it has created 76 new types of farm tools. Among more than 3,000 new products, there are 450 deep plows. At present, there are already several modern lathe equipment, and several simple wooden structure lathes and seeders have been initially trial-produced. In the process of the People's Commune continuously giving play to its superiority, this factory, which initially used pure indigenous methods for production, will be transformed into a modern agricultural machinery manufacturing factory run by the commune.

The above examples not only allow us to understand the Great Leap Forward of 1958 more specifically; at the same time, it can also show that 1959 will definitely see a more outstanding brilliant achievement than 1958; and it shows that the fact that a Great Leap Forward is followed by a larger leap forward has become an inevitable trend in the economic development of socialist countries.

Party Leadership and Mass Movements are the Key to Continuous Leaps Forward

From the process of the Great Leap Forward in production of the several factories mentioned above, we have also gained a very profound impression: the combination of the centralized leadership of the Party and the large-scale mass movement is the most important key to the continuous leap forward of all undertakings. Our Party—the Communist Party of China—proceeds from the highest interests of the people in everything, and strives for the happiness and progress of the people of the whole country and mankind; therefore, the Party is fully capable of freely grasping this truth and will always be integrated with the broad masses of workers and peasants. According to the will of the broad masses of working people, it leads the people of the whole country to complete the revolutionary tasks of each stage victoriously, and seize every new, even very weak, seedling among the masses, and timely propose research, repeated discussions, until it develops into a mass movement, supporting its growth and strength, and preparing conditions and opening up roads for the revolutionary cause of the next stage. The upsurge of the agricultural collectivization movement from 1955 to 1956, the people's commune movement launched nationwide last year, and the universal and in-depth rectification work this year are the most vivid examples. If we recall the events since the founding of the country, it will become even clearer.

At the beginning of the founding of New China, it took only three years to complete the task of economic recovery. According to the will of the workers and peasants, it launched a mass "Three-Anti" and "Five-Anti" movement, preparing the ideological foundation and mass strength for completing the first Five-Year Plan of socialist construction; the socialist revolution in 1956 achieved a decisive victory, changing the relations of production, and achieving the Great Leap Forward in production in 1956, preparing the victorious conditions for completing the tasks of the first Five-Year Plan ahead of schedule in 1957; the nationwide rectification movement and the struggle against the bourgeois rightists were launched in 1957, thus defeating the bourgeois rightists, expanding the revolutionary ranks, and creating a new social organizational form—the People's Commune—which is more suitable for the current development of rural productive forces, and an unprecedented Great Leap Forward in various undertakings; due to the great efforts in technical revolution and cultural revolution, and the result of the great efforts of the whole people to run industries and all undertakings, the face of our country has undergone tremendous changes. What is particularly worth pointing out is that the socialist and communist consciousness of the workers, peasants and other working people in our country has been greatly improved. For example, when the supply of light bulbs on the market was tight last winter and this spring, the staff and workers of an electrical appliance factory in Beijing believed that this was "still owing a debt to the people," and challenged each other, thus launching a "three-high" red flag competition movement. This kind of communist style, which regards satisfying the material needs of the people as their highest responsibility, is not an individual factory or an individual phenomenon, but a fairly common fact. Therefore, this factory can persist in implementing a system of unmanned meal sales among workers. The People's Great Hall project is a large-scale and high-standard project, rare in the world, but in the process of designing and construction at the same time, it can concentrate outstanding engineering personnel from all over the country, and obtain human and material support from all over the country, and complete the task within a short period of ten months. Such unimaginable things have appeared on the Chinese land where communist great collaboration has been brought into play. Under the general principle of the whole country as one chessboard, many production units resolutely ensure obedience to the overall situation, guarantee key points, and strive to achieve self-sufficiency in industrial materials or equipment: for example, Beijing Steel Plant refines its own coke; Beijing Motor Factory manufactures its own machine tools, which is a statement of fact.

Based on the above facts, we have recognized another truth: the reason why our country has achieved unprecedented Great Leap Forwards in the past and present, and will continue to achieve even greater leaps forward year by year in the future, is not determined by people's will, but is determined by the superior socialist system. This is the most basic aspect. There is also one aspect, that is, our Party—the Communist Party of China—is good at launching mass movements according to the will of the masses, mobilizing all possible positive factors, and giving play to all possible subjective initiative of the people, promoting the endless role of the superior socialist system.

Finally, please allow us to repeat a sentence: In our country, the general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results is already shining brightly on our way forward; a complete set of "walking on two legs" policies for developing the national economy clearly points out how to move forward; the broad masses of workers, peasants and other working people have firm confidence and soaring enthusiasm in the practice of socialist and communist education and struggle; as long as we can consistently follow the policy of relying on the leadership of the Party and combining it with large-scale mass movements, we will surely be able to guarantee the completion and overfulfillment of the 1959 plan with brilliant results; we can certainly build our country into a great socialist country with highly developed modern industry, modern agriculture, and mordern science and technology in fifteen or twenty years.

Let us shout:

Long live Chairman Mao!

Long live the Communist Party of China!

Long live the People's Republic of China!

    从滴水看海洋
    邢赞亭、陈建晨、楚溪春、邓哲熙委员就视察北京几个工厂时的见闻谈一九五八年的大跃进主席、各位委员：
    我们衷心拥护周总理在第二届全国人民代表大会上所作的政府工作报告和李富春副总理、李先念副总理所作的各项报告。完全同意彭真副委员长的全国人民代表大会常务委员会工作报告以及在政协会议上李维汉副主席的常务委员会工作报告。
    大跃进是社会主义国家经济发展的必然趋势
    我们通过了对政府工作报告的学习，结合了在北京市的实际视察，对于我国一九五八年的全面大跃进的辉煌成就，感到十分兴奋！农产品获得了史无前例的大丰收；工业和交通运输业，全面地跃进了；文化教育、科学研究和医药卫生事业，大大地发展了；在全国农村普遍展开了人民公社的运动，并已经发挥了无比的优越性；通过反右派斗争和整风运动，全国人民的社会主义觉悟，大大提高了。这一切都为我国高速度地建成社会主义、开展共产主义建设准备好了物质和精神条件，积累了十分丰富的经验。我国一九五九年的国民经济计划就是在这个基础上提出的。这一计划是十分宏伟的，艰巨的。但是由于我国有着全国各族人民的组织者、鼓舞者——中国共产党的领导；有着无比优越的社会主义制度；有着光芒万丈的鼓足干劲、力争上游，多、快、好、省建设社会主义总路线的照耀，我国勤劳奋勇的全体人民，一定能够努力完成和超额完成一九五九年的宏伟计划，形成一个比一九五八年更大、更好、更全面的大跃进！
    我们这种坚定不移的信心，绝不是幻想，也没有夸大，而是有着充分的事实根据的。让我们拿在北京市所看到的点滴情况来作为例证。
    北京市虽然是一个具有悠久历史的政治中心和文化中心，但它的工业基础，却是在一九五八年全面大跃进的过程中建立起来的，因而绝大多数的工厂都是新建或改建起来的。到目前为止，大部分的工厂，还是在边基建边生产的过程中，但却在设备不全、技术力量薄弱、原材料供应不足的情况下，创造了巨大的成绩。一九五八年的产值，超过了一九五七年的产值一倍多。今年又以百分之一百零七的成绩，超额完成了第一季度的任务。这个无法否认的事实，还可以从下列几个不同类型、大小悬殊的工厂中，看得更为明确。
    北京有一个电器厂，是重点工业之一。在苏联无私帮助之下，建成为具有世界第一流最新技术的工厂。在一九五八年的大跃进中，全厂职工紧紧地依靠党的领导，大搞群众运动，树立了敢想、敢干和大协作的共产主义风格，加强了组织工作。为了发挥重点工业的作用，大闹技术革命，根据我国的具体情况，在赶先进的技术基础上，作了若干改进，大大提高了劳动效率，在一九五八年就提前完成了原计划到一九六二年才能完成的任务，并且已经生产了原计划没有列入的超小型管和半导体。今年的计划已在工人群众的研究讨论中确定为：产量比去年翻一番，为原计划的一点五倍；产值翻一番半；产品增加百分之八十二；在改进技术的基础上提高劳动效率百分之九十六。目前全厂职工正以冲天的干劲，展开了高产、高质、高效率的“三高”红旗竞赛；满怀信心地为完成并超额完成一九五九年的任务而奋斗。
    北京电机厂，是在一九五八年大跃进中开始基建，十一月半才部分投入生产的，到现在为止，还是用工棚作办公室，设备不足百分之十，原材料供应不足，今年一、二两月份才完成季度计划的三分之一，但由于依靠了党的领导，大搞群众运动，大闹技术革命，加强了组织工作，作了全盘安排，发挥了大协作的精神，自制机床，提高了设备的自给率，在减轻体力劳动的同时，大大提高了劳动效率。因而，在三月份一个月的努力中，就超额完成了第一季度的任务。这就是全体职工，以坚定不移的信心，确定今年的生产任务为电动机四十万瓩，发电机为三万瓩，大大突破了原设计到一九六○年生产六万瓩的计划。
    在去年大闹全民办工业的时候，北京市宣武区椿树胡同，出现了一个一百多人搞起来的民办玻璃仪器厂。从去年十一月开始到现在已发展成为初具规模、有三百多工人的厂子。今年三月份一个月内就生产了八十万支安培，二十万支试管，比在解放前北京市全年生产的四十万至五十万支的数量，增加了一倍多。目前正在通过土洋结合的过程，向着洋法生产的方向迈进着。东城区的东风玩具厂，是十三位家庭妇女，在去年八、九月开始学习、试制，到年底才成立的，专为出口制造洋娃娃的工厂。现已有一百七十多个工人，虽然是完全用手工操作的，但却是一个贯彻执行劳动生产和教育相结合的、组织性和纪律性很好的新型生产单位。今年四月份的生产计划比三月份将增加百分之五十。
    周口店长沟人民公社的农具修配厂，是在去年冰天雪地的严寒时节修建的。厂房虽然十分简陋，但已有了翻砂车间，到现在为止，除修配农具以外，已经创制了七十六种新农具，在三千多件新制品中，有深耕犁四百五十件。目前已经有了几种现代化的车床设备，并有初步试制成功的几种木结构的简易车床和播种机等等。在人民公社不断发挥它的优越性的过程中，这个最初用纯土法生产的厂子，行将转化为一个社办的现代化的农业机械制造厂。
    以上的事例，不仅使我们更具体地了解了一九五八年的大跃进；同时也可以说明一九五九年一定能够出现一个比一九五八年更为出色的辉煌成绩；而且说明了一个大跃进接着又来一个更大的跃进的事实，已经成为社会主义国家的经济发展的必然趋势。
    党的领导和群众运动是不断跃进的关键
    从上面谈到的几个工厂生产大跃进的过程中，我们又获得了一个十分深刻的印象：党的集中领导和大搞群众运动相结合，是一切事业能够不断跃进的最重要的关键。我们的党——中国共产党，是一切从人民的最高利益出发的，是为了全国人民和全人类的幸福和进步而奋斗的；因此，党完全能够运用自如地掌握着这个真理，永远和广大的工、农群众融合在一起。根据广大劳动群众的意志，领导着全国人民，从胜利走向胜利地完成了每一个阶段的革命任务；抓住群众中每一件新生的，那怕还是十分微弱的萌芽，及时提出研究，反复讨论，一直到开展成为群众性的运动，扶植它成长、壮大，又为下一阶段的革命事业，准备了条件，开辟了道路。一九五五年到一九五六年的农业合作化的运动高潮，去年在全国范围内展开了的人民公社运动和今年的整社工作的普遍、深入，就是最鲜明的例证。如果让我们再回忆一下建国以来的事情，就更加明确。
    新中国建国之初，以短短三年的时间，就完成了经济恢复的任务。根据了工、农群众的意志，开展了群众性的“三反”、“五反”运动，为完成社会主义建设的第一个五年计划准备好了思想基础和群众力量；一九五六年的社会主义革命取得了决定性的胜利，改变了生产关系，就获得一九五六年的生产大跃进，为一九五七年提前完成第一个五年计划的任务准备好了胜利的条件；一九五七年展开了全民性的整风运动和反对资产阶级右派的斗争，从而打垮了资产阶级右派，扩大了革命的队伍，出现了更适合于当前农村生产力发展的一种新的社会组织形式——人民公社，出现了各项事业空前大跃进的局面；由于大闹技术革命和文化革命，大闹全民办工业全民办一切事业的结果，使我们国家的面貌，发生了巨大的变化。特别值得指出的，是我国工、农群众和其他劳动人民的社会主义和共产主义的觉悟大大提高了。举例来说，当去冬今春市场上的电灯泡供应紧张的时候，北京某电器厂的职工们认为，这就是“还欠着人民的债”，互相挑战，因而展开了“三高”红旗竞赛运动。像这种把满足人民物质需要，当作自己最高职责的共产主义风格，并不是个别工厂、个别的现象，而是相当普遍的事实。所以，这个工厂，就能够在工人中，坚持实行无人售饭的制度。人民大会堂的工程，是规模宏大、标准很高，世界少有的工程，但是它在边设计边施工的过程中，能够集中全国各地的优秀工程人员，获得全国各地的人力、物力支援，将在短短十个月以内完成任务。像这种不可能设想的事，却出现在发挥了共产主义大协作的中国土地上。不少的生产单位在全国一盘棋的总原则下，坚决做到服从整体，保证重点，努力做到工业材料或设备的自给率：例如北京钢厂自己炼焦；北京电机厂自制车床，就是事实的说明。
    根据以上的事实，又使我们认识了一个真理：我国的过去和现在所以能够获得史无前例的大跃进，今后将不断地获得一年比一年更大的跃进，都不是人们的意志所能决定的，而是决定于优越的社会主义制度。这是最基本的一面。还有一面，那就是我们的党——中国共产党，善于根据群众的意志，大搞群众运动，调动了一切可以调动的积极因素，发挥了一切可以发挥的人们的主观能动力量，促使优越的社会主义制度无穷无尽地发挥作用。
    最后，请允许我们重复一句话：在我国，鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线，已经是光芒万丈地照耀着我们前进的道路；发展国民经济的一整套“两条腿走路”的方针，明确地指出了如何前进的方法；广大的工、农群众和其他劳动人民，已经在社会主义、共产主义教育和斗争的实践中，有了坚定的信心和冲天的干劲；只要我们能够彻始彻终地循着依靠党的领导与大搞群众运动相结合的方针前进，就一定能够以辉煌的成果，保证完成和超额完成一九五九年的计划；就一定能够在十五年或二十年的时间，把我国建成为
  一个具有高度发展的现代工业、现代农业、现代科学技术的伟大的社会主义国家。
    让我们高呼：
    毛主席万岁！
    中国共产党万岁！
    中华人民共和国万岁！
