Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 24th. Chongqing Steel Company workers have recently successfully tested the "boiling desulfurization method" outside the cupola furnace and the "mixed slag rapid desulfurization method" inside the open-hearth furnace, further enriching and developing desulfurization experience. These two new desulfurization experiences have been tested many times and widely promoted in the company, proving that the desulfurization effect is very good and has an important effect on improving the quality of steel and shortening the smelting time.

	The "boiling desulfurization method" outside the cupola furnace was successfully tested by Peng Mingfa, a worker from the second shift of the cupola furnace in the open-hearth furnace workshop of this company. This method does not use soda ash or manual stirring, but only uses lime powder and fluorite as desulfurizers, and uses the boiling effect of ore and limestone instead of manual stirring. When the molten iron is discharged, add the lime powder and fluorite to the iron ladle. Peng Mingfa's cupola furnace team used this method to achieve an average desulfurization rate of 62.8%, with a maximum of 73.6%.

	Even after the pig iron is desulfurized outside the cupola furnace, the sulfur content is still very high. Only through further desulfurization by open-hearth furnace refining can qualified steel be produced. In order to solve the problem of open-hearth furnace desulfurization, Tang Xiqing, a steelmaking worker, Yang Kunsheng, a metallurgical technician, and Tan Jun, a team leader, from the open-hearth furnace workshop of this company, recently successfully tested the "mixed slag rapid desulfurization method" under the leadership and support of the company's Party organization. The original open-hearth furnace desulfurization method was to first add lime during the open-hearth furnace refining period, and then add desulfurizers such as manganese ore, fluorite, and iron oxide. This method was slow in desulfurization and long in smelting time. The "mixed slag rapid desulfurization method" is to mix lime, manganese ore, fluorite, and iron oxide and add them to the open-hearth furnace in batches. If the molten iron contains a high sulfur content, add it a few more times. This can fully utilize the explosive power of fluorite and manganese ore, and the lime dissolves quickly, keeping the furnace boiling all the time, with small temperature changes, and fast desulfurization effect. According to statistics, after adopting this method, the average desulfurization effect is increased by 25% compared with the original, and the smelting time of each furnace of steel can be controlled within seven hours and thirty minutes to nine hours, which is one and a half hours shorter than the original average.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 25th. The Guangzhou Municipal Party Committee's Steel Production Leading Group has, since the 11th of this month, concentrated the manpower, materials, and financial resources of the city's six key steelmaking units at the Guangzhou Iron and Steel Plant to conduct a major battle, in order to overcome the technical difficulties of steelmaking. This battle has received assistance from a working group specially dispatched by the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry. Liu Tianfu, Vice Governor of Guangdong Province, and Liang Xiang, Secretary of the Guangzhou Municipal Party Committee, also stayed at the factory to personally organize and direct the work.

Since Guangzhou's steelmaking departments have been retrofitting alkaline converters, the steel produced has had a relatively high sulfur content due to unfamiliarity with operating techniques and inconsistent operating procedures among the various steelmaking units. In order to train the technical team, unify operating procedures, quickly overcome the high sulfur and high phosphorus problems, and improve the quality and output of steel, this battle was organized.

In order to pool the wisdom of the masses, this battle established a system of pre-furnace, post-furnace meetings and furnace-by-furnace summaries with the participation of leading cadres, technical personnel, and workers from the very beginning. In the course of practice, they also developed a set of operating procedures from calcining dolomite, making furnace lining bricks, repairing furnaces, drying furnace shells to smelting in front of the furnace, so that the entire production process, from raw material management to casting into ingots, could be interlocked and desulfurized at every stage. As a result, the sulfur content of the steel gradually decreased during the battle. As of the 24th, this battle had gone through three rounds. The steel smelted in the first round had high sulfur and phosphorus content, and only 50% were first and second-grade products. In the second round, the proportion of first and second-grade products increased to 72.2%, but a small part of the steel still did not meet the specifications. The steel smelted in the third round was all qualified in terms of sulfur and phosphorus content, with first and second-grade products reaching 73.73%, and the output of steel also increased.

### 关关防高硫  炉炉出好钢  重钢创造脱硫新法，广州进行脱硫会战

    关关防高硫  炉炉出好钢
    重钢创造脱硫新法，广州进行脱硫会战
    新华社重庆24日电  重庆钢铁公司职工最近试验成功化铁炉炉外“沸腾脱硫法”和平炉炉内“混合造渣快速脱硫法”，进一步丰富和发展了脱硫的经验。这两种新的脱硫经验经过多次试验和在公司普遍推广，证明脱硫效果很好，对提高钢的质量、缩短冶炼时间有着重要作用。
    化铁炉炉外“沸腾脱硫法”是这个公司大平炉车间化铁炉二班工人彭明发试验成功的。这种方法不用苏打和人工搅拌，只用石灰粉和莹石作脱硫剂，用矿石和石灰石的沸腾作用代替人工搅拌，在出铁水的时候把石灰粉和莹石加入铁水包子内就行了。彭明发化铁炉班运用这个方法，平均脱硫达到62.8％，最高达到73.6％。
    生铁经过化铁炉炉外脱硫以后硫分仍然很高，只有经过平炉精炼进一步脱硫，才能炼出合格的钢。为了解决平炉脱硫的问题，这个公司大平炉车间的炼钢工人唐锡清、冶炼技术员杨坤生和班长谭均，最近在公司党组织的领导与支持下，试验成功了“混合造渣快速脱硫法”。原来平炉的脱硫方法，是在平炉精炼期先加石灰，然后补加锰矿、莹石、氧化铁等脱硫剂，这样脱硫速度慢，冶炼时间长。“混合造渣快速脱硫法”是将石灰、锰矿、莹石与氧化铁混合分批加入平炉，遇到含硫成份较高的铁水，就多加几次。这样可以充分利用莹石、锰矿本身的爆炸能力，石灰溶解快，使炉内一直保持沸腾，温度变化小，脱硫效果快。据统计，采用这个方法后，平均脱硫效果比原来提高25％，每炉钢的冶炼时间可控制在七点三十分钟到九点钟以内，比原来平均缩短一个半小时。
    新华社广州25日电  中共广州市委钢铁生产领导小组从本月11日开始，把全市六个炼钢重点单位的人力、物力、财力，集中到广州钢铁厂进行大会战，借以攻克炼钢技术关。这场会战得到了冶金工业部专门派出的工作组的协助；广东省副省长刘田夫和中共广州市委书记梁湘，也住到厂里亲自组织和指挥。
    广州市炼钢部门改装碱性转炉以来，由于操作技术不熟练，各个炼钢单位的操作规程不统一，因此炼出的钢含硫量仍然较高。为了培训技术队伍，统一操作规程，迅速攻克高硫、高磷关，提高钢的质量和产量，所以组织了这场会战。
    为了集思广益，这场会战一开始就建立了有领导干部、技术人员和工人参加的炉前、炉后会议和炉炉总结的制度；在实践过程中，他们又制订了从焙烧白云石、制炉衬砖、修砌炉子、烘干炉壳到炉前冶炼的一套操作规程，使整个生产过程，从原料管理到浇铸成锭，都能够环环相扣，关关脱硫。因而在会战过程中，钢的含硫量逐步下降。到24日为止，这场会战已经经过了三个回合。第一个回合吹炼出来的钢，硫、磷含量较高，一、二级品只有50％；第二个回合一、二级品提高到72.2％，但仍有小部分钢不合规格；第三个回合吹炼出来的钢，硫、磷含量全部合格，一、二级品达到73.73％，钢的产量也有提高。
