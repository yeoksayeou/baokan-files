Xinhua News Agency, May 5th: Vice Premier of the State Council and Minister of Foreign Affairs Marshal Chen Yi held a banquet tonight to bid farewell to the Algerian Military Delegation headed by Commander Omar U Sidiq, who is about to return home.

At the banquet, Marshal Chen Yi said that the Algerian Military Delegation's visit to our country this time has made important contributions to enhancing mutual understanding and fighting friendship between the people of our two countries. He said that the Chinese people have always sympathized with and supported the Algerian people. In the struggle against colonial rule and for national independence, the 650 million Chinese people will always stand with the Algerian people.

Marshal Chen Yi said that the Algerian people's struggle is still in a difficult stage. However, the temporary rampantness of French colonialism does not indicate its strength, but only a deathbed struggle before its demise. The Algerian people have not succumbed to cannons and bombs, nor have they been deceived by conspiracies and tricks. On the contrary, the Algerian people and the National Liberation Army are becoming more and more courageous and confident in their struggle. The Chinese people firmly believe based on their own experience that as long as the Algerian people and army are united and carry the liberation war through to the end, one day they will drive the colonialists out of Algerian territory.

Marshal Chen Yi said that the international situation is unprecedentedly favorable to the Algerian people. The Algerian people's struggle is not only supported by the Chinese people, but also by the people of the entire powerful socialist camp, the people of Asian and African countries, and all honest people in the world. This is an important condition for the Algerian people to win final victory. The imperialist aggressive bloc headed by the United States is most afraid of the mutual unity between countries striving for and safeguarding national independence, and the unity between these countries and socialist countries. Therefore, they use all despicable means to undermine this unity, attempting to isolate the national independence struggles of the people of Asian, African, and Latin American countries, prevent them from obtaining mutual support, and prevent them from obtaining the support of socialist countries, so as to arbitrarily control the fate of these countries, let go of suppressing national independence movements, and restore control over countries that have already gained independence. However, the increasingly awakened people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America are increasingly clearly aware of who their real enemies are and who their real friends are. Imperialism's attempt to save its doomed fate by dividing the unity of the people of the world is bound to fail.

Commander Omar U Sidiq said at the banquet that the Algerian people, the National Liberation Army, and the Algerian government will never forget the warm welcome our military delegation received in China. He then spoke of the Algerian people's firm determination to fight for national independence. He said that Algeria will never serve as an imperialist base of aggression, and the Algerian people must carry the revolution through to the end. The Algerian National Liberation Army will not leave the front line until the goal of national independence is achieved.

Attending the banquet were General Gan Siqi, General Peng Shaohui, General Chen Shiju, General Li Zhimin, Lieutenant General Liu Zhijian, Lieutenant General Yang Xiushan, Air Force Lieutenant General Cao Lihuai, Navy Lieutenant General Liu Daosheng and other senior generals of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, as well as Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Ji Pengfei.

Military attachés from various countries stationed in China and diplomatic personnel from the embassies of Albania, North Korea, Vietnam, and Mongolia in China also attended the banquet.

　　陈毅元帅向阿尔及利亚军事代表团临别赠言
    军民团结把解放战争进行到底
    乌西迪克团长说：独立目标一天不实现我们就一天不离开前线
    新华社5日讯　国务院副总理兼外交部长陈毅元帅今晚举行宴会，欢送即将归国的以奥马尔·乌西迪克团长为首的阿尔及利亚军事代表团。
    陈毅元帅在宴会上说，阿尔及利亚军事代表团这次在我国访问，对增进我们两国人民之间的相互了解和战斗友谊作出了重要的贡献。他说，中国人民同阿尔及利亚人民一贯相互同情，相互支持。在反对殖民统治和争取民族独立的斗争中，六亿五千万中国人民永远同阿尔及利亚人民站在一起。
    陈毅元帅说，阿尔及利亚人民的斗争还处在一个艰苦和困难的阶段。但是，法国殖民主义的一时猖狂并不表示它的强大，而只不过是它死亡以前的回光反照而已。阿尔及利亚人民没有在大炮和炸弹下屈服，也没有被阴谋诡计所蒙骗。相反的，阿尔及利亚人民和民族解放军的斗志越战越盛，信心越战越强。中国人民根据自己的切身经验坚信：只要阿尔及利亚人民和军队团结一致，把解放战争进行到底，总有一天会把殖民主义者从阿尔及利亚领土上赶出去。
    陈毅元帅说，国际形势空前有利于阿尔及利亚人民。阿尔及利亚人民的斗争不仅得到中国人民的支持，而且得到整个强大的社会主义阵营各国人民、亚非各国人民和世界上一切正直人们的支持。这是阿尔及利亚人民争取最后胜利的重要条件。以美国为首的帝国主义侵略集团最害怕争取和维护民族独立的国家之间的相互团结，以及这些国家同社会主义国家之间的团结。因此它们用尽一切卑鄙手段来破坏这种团结，企图使亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲各国人民的民族独立斗争孤立起来，得不到相互支持，得不到社会主义国家的支持，以便任意摆布这些国家的命运，放手镇压民族独立运动，重新恢复对于已经独立的国家的控制，但是，日益觉醒的亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的各国人民越来越清楚地了解，谁是他们真正的敌人，谁是他们真正的朋友。帝国主义妄图用分裂世界人民团结的办法来挽救它们必然失败的命运，是一定要失败的。
    奥马尔·乌西迪克团长在宴会上说，阿尔及利亚人民、民族解放军和阿尔及利亚政府将永远不会忘记，我们军事代表团在中国所受到的热烈的欢迎。他接着谈到了阿尔及利亚人民争取民族独立斗争的坚强决心。他说，阿尔及利亚将永远不会充当帝国主义的侵略基地，阿尔及利亚人民一定要将革命进行到底，民族独立的目标一天不实现，阿尔及利亚民族解放军就一天不离开前线。
    出席宴会的，有甘泗淇上将、彭绍辉上将、陈士榘上将、李志民上将、刘志坚中将、杨秀山中将、曹里怀空军中将、刘道生海军中将等中国人民解放军高级将领，还有外交部副部长姬鹏飞。
    各国驻华武官和阿尔巴尼亚、朝鲜、越南、蒙古驻我国大使馆外交人员也出席了宴会。
