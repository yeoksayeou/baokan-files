Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 19th: Workers from seven units of Anshan Iron and Steel Company are launching an inter-factory collaborative competition focused on improving the quality and quantity of pig iron, called "Increase Iron and Safeguard Steel." The Anshan Iron and Steel Trade Union convened representatives from the Iron Smelting Plant, Chemical General Plant, Sintering General Plant, Power Plant, Transportation Department, East Anshan Iron Mine, and Dagushan Iron Mine, who formally signed the inter-factory collaborative competition contract on the 16th.

    At the meeting for signing the inter-factory competition contract, representatives from the Iron Smelting Plant proposed guarantees: the qualification rate of pig iron will reach 98%; the coke ratio will be reduced to an average of 0.65; and the utilization coefficient will reach an average of 1.693. Subsequently, representatives from the Sintering General Plant proposed guarantees to the Iron Smelting Plant: the sinter qualification rate will be greater than 92% (the company's target is 90%), and the iron content will reach 50% to 54%. Representatives from the Chemical General Plant also proposed guarantees to the Iron Smelting Plant: the average coke strength will reach 315 kilograms, and the coke ash content will be below 14%. Representatives from the Dagushan and East Anshan iron mines guaranteed to supply the blast furnaces with sufficient quantities of high-quality ore, ensuring the blast furnaces are well-fed. Workers operating the blowers at the power plant guaranteed to provide each blast furnace with sufficient air volume and pressure. Employees of the Transportation Department also guaranteed to the Iron Smelting Plant that they would allocate tanks on time, transporting as much gas ash and iron blocks as were produced, and removing ash according to the furnace output, preventing dust collectors from accumulating. In addition, these seven units also proposed many specific conditions and measures of mutual guarantee to each other.

    At this conference for signing the competition contract, Lin Cheng, Deputy Manager of Anshan Iron and Steel Company, delivered a speech. He said: The purpose of this inter-factory competition is to increase pig iron production and ensure the quality and quantity of steel; organizing collaborative competition is one of the effective ways to solve the various contradictions in the production of our combined enterprise. Employees should further consolidate and establish the concept of "the whole country as one chessboard," and do everything possible to improve the quantity and quality of raw materials and fuel for iron smelting.

    In order to strengthen leadership over this competition, a competition leading group was also formed at the meeting, and methods for inspection, summary, evaluation, and reward were studied. (Attached photo)

    鞍钢七个单位签订合同
    协作竞赛增铁保钢
    新华社鞍山19日电　鞍山钢铁公司七个单位的职工，展开以提高生铁质量产量为中心的“增铁保钢”厂际协作竞赛。鞍钢工会召集了炼铁厂、化工总厂、烧结总厂、发电厂、运输部、东鞍山铁矿、大孤山铁矿七个单位的代表，在16日正式签定了厂际协作竞赛合同。
    在签定厂际竞赛合同的会议上，炼铁厂职工代表提出保证：生铁质量合格率达到98％；焦比平均降低到零点六五；利用系数平均达到一点六九三。接着，烧结总厂代表向炼铁厂提出保证：烧结矿合格率大于92％（公司指标为90％），含铁量达到50％到54％。化工总厂代表也向炼铁厂提出保证：焦炭强度平均达到三百一十五公斤，焦炭灰分在14％以下。大孤山和东鞍山两铁矿代表保证供给高炉数量足、质量高的矿石，让高炉吃饱吃好。发电厂操作鼓风机的工人，保证使各高炉有充足的风量、风压。运输部的职工也向炼铁厂保证正点配罐，做到瓦斯灰、铁块生产多少就拉多少，并按炉出灰，除尘器不积压。此外，这七个单位相互之间也提出了许多互相保证的具体条件和措施。
    在这个签订竞赛合同的大会上，鞍山钢铁公司副经理林诚讲了话。他说：这次开展厂际竞赛的目的是为了增产生铁，保证钢的质量产量；组织协作竞赛是解决我们联合企业生产中各种矛盾的有效办法之一。职工们要进一步巩固和树立起一盘棋的思想，千方百计地提高炼铁的原料、燃料的数量和质量。
    为了加强对这一竞赛的领导，会上还组成了竞赛领导小组，研究了检查总结评比奖励的办法。（附图片）
