    Liangshui Town Commune, Liaocheng, Songshu Li Brigade Formulates Four Measures
    Special Personnel to Manage Wheat Seed Plots
    (Our Dispatch) The Songshu Li Production Brigade of Liangshui Town People's Commune in Liaocheng City, Shandong Province, in order to do a good job in wheat seed selection, has determined seed retention plots and organized special personnel to strengthen management.
    In early May, the brigade organized more than ten people, including cadres, technicians, and experienced farmers, to go deep into the fields for on-site inspection. After evaluation, based on the next year's wheat planting area, five plots totaling 180 mu of Bima No. 4 seed land were selected.
    In order to strive for wheat seed retention plots with many grains per ear and full grains, the brigade formulated four management measures: (1) Clever irrigation. Irrigate twice more before harvesting. (2) Clever fertilization, applying quick-acting fertilizer. Fertilization is carried out at the same time as the two irrigations. The first time, 20 jin of phosphate and potash fertilizer is applied per mu, and the second time, 10 jin is applied, to ensure that the wheat stalks are strong and the grains are full. (3) Continue to prevent lodging and wind damage. (4) Timely prevention and control of diseases and insect pests.
    After the management measures were formulated, the brigade immediately assigned a deputy captain to take charge of this work, and more than ninety experienced farmers were assigned to manage this work, implementing a contracted responsibility system with fixed plots, fixed measures, fixed output, fixed harvesting, fixed threshing, fixed storage, fixed work points, and fixed rewards and punishments, with responsibility assigned to each person. At present, the brigade is actively carrying out the management of seed retention plots according to the prescribed measures. The preparatory work for harvesting and threshing the good seeds is also actively underway. Two special threshing grounds and two special warehouses have been prepared, and all the large and small agricultural tools for harvesting and threshing wheat from the seed plots have been fully prepared.

    聊城梁水镇公社松树李大队订出四项措施
    专人管理小麦种子地
    本报讯　山东聊城市梁水镇人民公社松树李生产大队，为做好小麦选种工作，确定了留种地，并组织专人加强管理。
    5月初，该队组织了干部、技术员和有经验的农民等十余人，深入田间，实地检查，经过评选，根据下年度小麦的种植面积，选出五块共一百八十亩碧蚂四号种子地。
    为了争取留种地小麦穗穗粒多、粒粒饱满，该大队制订了四项管理措施：（1）巧浇水。收割前再浇两次水。（2）巧施肥，施速效肥。施肥与两次浇水同时进行，第一次亩施磷钾肥二十斤，第二次施十斤，切实保证小麦秸秆粗壮，籽粒饱满。（3）继续防倒伏，防风。（4）及时防治病虫害。
    管理措施订出后，该大队立即抽出一名副队长专责领导这一工作，并抽出九十多名有经验的农民专门管理这项工作，并实行了定地块、定措施、定产量、定收割、定打轧、定保管、定工分、定奖惩的包干责任制，一包到底，责任到人。现在，该大队正在根据规定的措施，积极进行留种地的管理工作。良种地的收打准备工作也正在积极进行，已做好两个专用的场园、两座专用的仓房，收打种子地的小麦的大小农具也已全部备齐。（附图片）
