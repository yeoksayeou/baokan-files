Comrade Representatives:
    I fully agree with and wholeheartedly endorse Premier Zhou's Government Work Report and the reports by Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen.
    Premier Zhou's report succinctly and comprehensively elaborated on the glorious achievements of the First Five-Year Plan and the unprecedented nationwide Great Leap Forward of 1958, and put forward the glorious tasks for 1959. Therefore, this report is both a milestone in the motherland's leaping advance under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, and a guiding beacon leading the motherland from victory to even greater victories.
    I am extremely excited and encouraged by this magnificent and splendid report. Looking back and looking forward, I see a bright future and boundless spring, and I am deeply grateful to the Party and Chairman Mao for leading the 600 million people into this beautiful and happy situation. At the same time, I believe that although these miraculous achievements are Chinese, their significance and influence are not limited to China. Undoubtedly, they will strengthen the power of the socialist camp and play a huge role in defending world peace.
    I am a cultural and educational worker. Below, I will combine my work to talk about my two shallow understandings of the development of education and the transformation of intellectuals.

    Regarding the Development of Education
    First, let's talk about the development of education. Accompanying the comprehensive Great Leap Forward of the socialist economy, a climax has also appeared in socialist culture and education. One horse takes the lead, and ten thousand horses gallop forward. The same is true in education. The great achievements of education are not only reflected in the quantitative development, with more schools and more students, but more importantly, after the rectification movement and the anti-Rightist struggle, the Party's strong leadership has been established in cultural and educational undertakings; it is the implementation of the Party's education policy, that education serves the politics of the working class, and that education is combined with productive labor. In this way, a magnificent and profoundly significant education revolution has rapidly unfolded.
    Everyone knows that a certain education serves a certain political economy. Education is an important weapon of class struggle. Therefore, who leads education, is it the bourgeoisie? Is it the proletariat? In other words, is it led by the Party, or by so-called experts (bourgeois experts)? This is actually a reflection of class struggle in education. It is precisely for this reason that when the bourgeois Rightists took advantage of the rectification movement to launch a frenzied attack on the Party, the leadership of education was also what they vainly wanted to usurp. Their despicable purpose was nothing more than to start with education and finally drag the country onto the reactionary capitalist road. The Rightists have been defeated, and the Party's strong leadership has been established in all departments and units of education. This is the victory of socialist education, the victory of the people's education.
    Under the Party's strong leadership, the re-proposed proletarian education policy has been consistently implemented throughout the country. The implementation of the education policy has brought schools into a new stage and presented a new look. I am an ignorant person with an extremely narrow scope of contact, but what I have personally felt in my workplace – Shandong University – has given me tremendous encouragement.
    Steelmaking, Relocation
    Like other units, in the autumn and winter of 1958, the teachers and students of Shandong University engaged in large-scale steelmaking, and at the same time, in just one month, moved the school from Qingdao to Jinan. Steelmaking and relocation are not easy or small matters, and they are also new or infrequent events. However, under the leadership of the Party, they did not hinder each other, but promoted each other. This is because in collective productive labor, teachers and students were tempered and began to change their bad habits of fearing tiredness and dirtiness. Therefore, as soon as the Party issued a call, everyone enthusiastically and happily started working together, undertaking the packaging, loading, unloading, and transportation of the school's books, instruments, and various supplies. With many people and great strength, the relocation was also fast, good, and economical. Since the relocation problem was quickly resolved, people's strength was concentrated on steelmaking, and the task of steelmaking was completed ahead of schedule and above quota.
    During steelmaking, we encountered continuous autumn rains. On roads full of mud, students braved the wind and rain to pull ore from dozens of miles away. They were all full of energy, tense and happy, talking, laughing, pulling their carts and running fast, competing with each other. This enthusiasm is political enthusiasm. The thought of the Great Leap Forward is inspiring them.
    Old and sick teachers, although the leadership gave them special care, not allowing them to do much work, especially heavy work, they still walked out of their studies and classrooms, into the iron factory, put down their pens and picked up their hammers. In the dusty workshops, they also tried their best to improve their work output and quality. The practice of physical labor has gradually changed the exploiting class's idea of ​​despising labor and despising laborers.
    It is absolutely true that steelmaking and personnel training have both yielded bumper harvests. The political significance of teachers and students participating in productive labor exceeds its economic significance.
    Three Combinations
    Teaching, scientific research, and productive labor are the three combinations. After a period of lively labor, at the end of last year, the teachers and students of Shandong University launched a new battle in teaching and scientific research. Not to mention the specific results in this regard, just the new atmosphere that appeared in the battle makes people feel a strong revolutionary atmosphere. That is, according to work needs, dare to abandon the old ways, dare to think, dare to speak, and dare to do. That is, the spirit of collectivism has gained a leading position, and the idea of ​​calculating personal fame and gain has become private goods, something that cannot be seen.
    In teaching and scientific research, new teacher-student relationships are growing. Many teachers have gone deep into the student masses, bringing help with learning to their doorsteps. Students affectionately call them "our good teachers." In collective scientific research, the contact between teachers and students is more frequent. Students surround the teachers, everyone asks questions and debates, and jointly discuss academic issues. Everyone is a comrade, and each other's goal is the same – to strive for the cultural construction of the motherland. The old and the young can learn from each other, criticize each other, to achieve common progress.
    Of course, in the universities across the country, these situations at Shandong University are also very common, but for this reason, we can better see the great significance of this education revolution and the correctness of the Party's education policy. Of course, these new atmospheres in the school are just a good start, but I believe that under the situation of the motherland's continued comprehensive leap forward, the Party's education policy will be better implemented, and thousands upon thousands of young socialist and communist builders will be continuously cultivated. As an old teacher who has been teaching for more than 30 years, after learning and understanding the Party's policies, facing these beautiful new things, how can you not be excited, how can you not be determined, under the leadership of the Party, to dedicate all my strength to the cause of education!

    Regarding the Transformation of Intellectuals
    Secondly, let's talk about the transformation of intellectuals. The Party has always been very concerned about intellectuals. Since liberation, under the Party's policy of unity and transformation, the vast majority of old intellectuals have made progress to varying degrees. Especially in the past two years, after a series of movements such as anti-Rightist, heart-to-heart talks, double-anti, education revolution, and criticism of bourgeois academic thought, their political thought and academic thought have generally made unprecedented leaps. However, there are still a few people who have two kinds of ideological situations. One is that some people are satisfied with their own progress, believing that they have been transformed very well. Therefore, they want to stay at the current stage; the other is that some people always have a resistant attitude towards transformation, willingly staying behind, thinking that as long as they don't become Rightists, no one can do anything to them. Such two types of thinking are of course wrong. Just imagine that in today's era of rapid progress in the motherland, when one day is equal to twenty years, as an old intellectual, even if you try every means to transform yourself, you are still afraid of not keeping up with the advancing team. If you are content with the status quo and stagnate, you will inevitably be abandoned by the times; in this way, it will not only bring losses to the people's cause, but also destroy yourself. I hope that people with such thoughts can recognize the situation, recognize themselves, and catch up.

    Six Methods
    How to carry out self-transformation, of course, everyone has their own specific situation and cannot be forced to be the same, but the following points seem to be universal: First, wholeheartedly follow the Party, and go wherever the Party points. Second, honestly and practically study Marxist-Leninist theory and Chairman Mao's works, and further change the bourgeois worldview. Third, transform one's exploiting class ideology from productive labor, especially physical labor, and learn the excellent qualities of the working people. Fourth, constantly use the current situation and the people's requirements to check one's own thoughts, so as to discover mistakes and correct them. Fifth, accept education from positive teachers, and also accept education from negative teachers; positive teachers teach people to know what to follow, and negative teachers teach people to know what to avoid. Sixth, have the spirit of continuous revolution, never relax on one's own transformation, and always move forward.

    Improve from Work
    In addition to the above six points, I also feel that taking the work post as a base and improving one's ideological awareness from work is a very effective method. Therefore, for intellectuals engaged in cultural and educational work, implementing the Party's education policy, promoting the development of education, and self-ideological transformation are closely related. That is to say, with progressive ideas, can the Party's education policy be well implemented; at the same time, in the process of implementing the Party's education policy, one's ideology is also improved. I am extremely ashamed that I have done too poorly in education and self-transformation, and have deeply failed the Party's cultivation of me and the people's trust in me. In the future, I must strictly demand myself, and with the Party's education and the help of the masses, continue to move forward, to repay the Party and the people for their deep kindness to me. To commemorate the tenth anniversary of the founding of our great motherland, I am determined to muster all my energy, give full play to all my strength in my work post and in the collective, and complete the various tasks assigned by the leadership, as a gift to the National Day.

### 为教育事业献出我所有的力量  冯沅君代表的发言

　　为教育事业献出我所有的力量
    冯沅君代表的发言各位代表：
    我完全同意并竭诚拥护周总理的政府工作报告和李富春副总理、李先念副总理、彭真副委员长的报告。
    周总理的报告简括而周详，原则而具体地阐述了第一个五年计划的辉煌成就与一九五八年的史无前例的全民全面大跃进，并提出一九五九年的光荣任务。因此，这个报告既是祖国在党与毛主席领导下飞跃前进的里程碑，同时，又是个引导祖国由胜利走向更大的胜利指路碑。
    我为这个宏伟壮丽的报告而极度兴奋鼓舞，瞻前顾后，我看到一片光明，无边春色，而深深地感激党与毛主席将六亿人民引进这个美好幸福的境地，同时，我认为这许多奇迹般的成就虽是中国的，可是它们的意义与影响却不限于是中国的。无疑地，它们将加强社会主义阵营的力量，而在保卫世界和平上也将起着巨大作用。
    我是个文教工作者，以下结合着我的工作谈谈我对教育事业的发展和知识分子的改造的两点浅薄体会。
    关于教育事业的发展问题
    首先谈教育事业的发展的问题。伴随着社会主义经济的全面大跃进，社会主义的文化教育也出现了高潮。一马当先，万马奔腾，在教育事业上也非例外。教育事业的巨大成就不仅表现在数量的发展上，学校多了，学生多了，更重要的，是经过整风运动与反右斗争，党的坚强领导在文教事业上树立起来了；是党的教育方针，教育为工人阶级的政治服务，教育和生产劳动相结合的方针的贯彻执行。这样，一个波澜壮阔，意义深巨的教育革命便迅速地展开了。
    大家都晓得，一定的教育是为一定的政治经济服务的。教育是阶级斗争的一个重要武器。因而教育由谁领导，是由资产阶级？是由无产阶级？换句话说是由党领导，还是由所谓专家（资产阶级专家）领导，实是阶级斗争在教育事业上的反映。也正是为此，当资产阶级右派钻整风的空子，向党猖狂进攻时，教育领导权也是他们妄想要篡夺的。他们的卑鄙的目的无非是要从教育下手，最后将国家拖上反动的资本主义道路。右派被打垮了，党的坚强领导在教育事业的各部门、各单位树立起来，这是社会主义的教育事业的胜利，人民的教育事业的胜利。
    在党的坚强领导下，重新提出的无产阶级教育方针在全国一致地贯彻执行。教育方针的贯彻执行使学校跨入新阶段，出现新面貌。我是个孤陋寡闻、接触面极为狭窄的人，但在工作岗位——山东大学里，身所感受的已给我莫大的振奋。
    炼钢、迁校
    同其他单位一样，一九五八年的秋冬，山东大学的师生大搞钢铁，同时还在短短一个月内，将学校由青岛迁到济南。炼铁、迁校，这两个工作都不是轻而易举的小事，而且还是新事或不常有的事。然而，在党的领导下，它们并不曾互相妨碍，而是互相推动着。这是因为在集体性的生产劳动中师生们得到锻炼，开始改变怕累怕脏的不良习惯，所以党一发出号召大家便热热闹闹，欢欢喜喜地一齐动手，把学校的图书仪器以至种种用具的包扎、装卸和运输工作都担承起来。人多力大，搬家也搬得多快好省。迁校问题既得到迅速的解决，人们的力量就集中在炼铁上，炼铁的任务也就提前、超额地完成了。
    在炼铁时曾碰上连绵的秋雨。在满是泥浆的路上，冒着风雨，学生们连夜向几十里外拉矿石。他们却都是精神饱满，紧张愉快，说着，笑着，拉起车子飞跑，彼此间展开竞赛。这种热情是政治的热情。跃进的思想在鼓舞着他们。
    年老多病的教师们，虽然领导上特别照顾，不让他们多干活，特别是重活，但他们毕竟是走出书房、教室，走进铁厂，放下笔杆，拿起锤子。在尘土飞扬的工棚里，他们也是竭心尽力地来提高自己的工作产量和质量。体力劳动的实践使轻视劳动，轻视劳动者的剥削阶级思想逐步有所改变。
    炼铁炼人双丰收是完全真实的。学校师生参加生产劳动的政治意义超过它的经济意义。
    三结合
    教学、科学研究与生产劳动是三结合。经过一段热热闹闹的劳动后，去年年底山东大学的师生在教学与科学研究上展开新的战斗。且不说这方面的具体战果，单就战斗中出现的新风气说也就教人感到一种浓厚的革命气息。那就是根据工作需要，敢于丢掉老一套，敢想，敢说，敢做。那就是集体主义精神获得主导地位，斤斤较量个人名利的思想成为私货，成为见不得人的东西。
    在教学与科学研究中，新的师生关系在成长着。不少教师深入到学生群众中，将帮助学习送上门来。学生亲切地称他们为“我们的好老师”。在集体搞科学研究中，师生的接触更频繁。学生围绕着教师，大家质疑论难，共同商讨学术上的问题。大家都是同志，彼此的目标是共同的——为祖国的文化建设而奋斗。年老的，年青的可以互相学习，互相批评，以取得共同进步。
    当然，在全国的高等学校中，山东大学的这些情况也是很普通的，可是也就为此，我们更能看出这次教育革命的重大意义，党的教育方针的正确。当然，现在学校中这些新气象还只是个良好的开端，可是我相信，在祖国继续全面跃进的形势下，党的教育方针将贯彻执行得更好，成千成万的、年青的社会主义、共产主义建设者将源源不绝地被培养起来。身为任教三十多年的老教师，在通过学习，认识了党的方针政策后，面对着这些美好的新事物，你教她如何能不振奋，如何能不下定决心，在党的领导下，为教育事业献出我所有的力量！
    关于知识分子的改造问题
    其次谈知识分子改造的问题。对知识分子，党是一向很关怀的。解放以来，在党的团结改造的政策下，绝大多数旧知识分子都有不同程度的进步。尤其是最近两年来，经过反右、交心、双反、教育革命、资产阶级学术思想批判等一系列的运动，他们的政治思想、学术思想，一般地说都有空前的跃进。但是，还有少数人存在着两种思想情况。一种是有些人满足于自己的进步，认为自己已经改造得很好了。因而想停留在现阶段上；另一种是有些人对改造老是怀着抵触情绪，甘居下游，认为只要不作右派，便无人能奈他何。这样的两类思想当然都是错误的。试想在祖国突飞猛进，一天等于二十年的今天，作为个旧知识分子即令千方百计地改造自己，还怕跟不上前进的队伍，如果安于现状，停滞不前，势必为时代所抛弃；这样，不仅给人民的事业带来了损失，而且是毁灭自己。我希望具有这样思想的人都能认清形势，认清自己，而奋起直追。
    六点办法
    如何进行自我改造，当然每人都有其具体情况，不能强同，但以下几点似乎可说是具有普遍性的：首先要一心一意跟着党走，党指向那里就奔向那里。其次，老老实实地，联系实际地学习马克思列宁主义理论与毛主席的著作，进一步改变资产阶级的世界观。第三，从生产劳动中，特别是体力劳动中，改造自己的剥削阶级思想，学习劳动人民的优良品德。第四，经常用当前形势与人民的要求检查自己的思想，从而发现错误，进行纠正。第五，从正面老师接受教育，也从反面老师接受教育；正面老师教人知所法，反面老师教人知所戒。第六，要有不断革命的精神，对自己的改造永不放松，永远前进。
    从工作中提高
    以上六点之外，我还觉得以工作岗位为基地，从工作中提高自己的思想觉悟是个很有效的办法。因此，对于从事文教工作的知识分子来说，贯彻执行党的教育方针推动教育事业发展和自我思想改造是紧密联系着的。也就是说，有了进步思想，才能很好地贯彻执行党的教育方针；同时在贯彻执行党的教育方针中也就提高了思想。我异常惭愧，在教育工作和自我改造上都做得太差，深负党对我的培养，人民对我的信任。今后一定要严格要求自己，在党的教育与群众的帮助下，不断前进，以答谢党和人民对我的深厚恩情。为纪念我们伟大祖国的建国十周年，我决心鼓足干劲，在工作岗位上，在集体中，发挥自己的一切力量，完成领导上交给的各种任务，作为向国庆的献礼。
