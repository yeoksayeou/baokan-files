Chairman, fellow representatives:

We fully agree with and support Premier Zhou Enlai's "Government Work Report" and the reports by Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen. We will resolutely follow the spirit of the reports' instructions and strive actively for their realization.

Recently, a small group of reactionary elements in Tibet launched a rebellion in Tibet. After their failure, they fled to India to collude with imperialists and foreign reactionaries, attempting to create so-called Tibetan "independence." We are very surprised and indignant. We heard that on April 18, Indian diplomatic officials distributed a flawed and distorted so-called "Statement by the Dalai Lama" and heard the slander and vilification of our country by interventionist elements in the Indian press. China and India have always been friendly neighbors, the initiators of the "Five Principles," and the recent events in India related to Tibet have seriously threatened the friendly relations between China and India and the Five Principles. We must not allow interventionist elements to use this friendship to interfere in China's internal affairs. The era when China could be bullied by others is gone forever. Inheriting the legacy of British imperialism's aggression against Tibet is impossible. We advise our Indian friends that, to cherish the long-term friendship between the Chinese and Indian people and the continued friendship in the future, to ensure peaceful coexistence between the two peoples, and to consolidate the cause of world peace, wise decisions should be made regarding the current clamor of interventionist elements in India and other kinds of ulterior activities.

We would now like to express some opinions on the issue of the state's socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, based on the situation in Guangdong Province.

Guangdong's industrialists and businessmen have made some progress in their ideological understanding, but their political stance has not changed; they should not overestimate their progress.

Like all parts of the country, Guangdong Province has adopted a policy of peaceful redemption for the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce. Over the past few years, we have carried out the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce, transforming capitalist enterprises into joint state-private enterprises of a socialist nature, replacing the capitalist ownership of the means of production with the socialist ownership by the whole people. At the same time, we have carried out the transformation of us industrialists and businessmen and have done a series of works, giving us fixed interest on the economic front, maintaining high salaries, and also making appropriate arrangements on the political front. Furthermore, through work, labor, learning, and social life practices, and through a series of education and exercises, we will gradually transform an exploiter into a self-reliant laborer. The practice of several years proves that the Party and the government's policy of redemption towards the bourgeoisie is completely correct and can enable bourgeois elements to smoothly transition to socialism through the path of peaceful transformation.

Under the correct leadership of the Party, Guangdong's industrialists and businessmen, after a series of movements and education, after the tempering and testing of the anti-Rightist struggle and the rectification movement, and the socialist and communist education centered on the people's commune, have made some progress in their political awareness and continue to improve their ideological understanding. This is manifested in the progress of the socialist construction cause, where they have fulfilled their responsibilities in enterprises and various work positions. During the Great Leap Forward in 1958, many people actively responded to the Party's call, participated in various central tasks, and exerted a certain amount of strength. In the "Double Contribution" movement in enterprises, they contributed their talents and technologies. Many people had good performances and achieved success.

As shown by the facts cited above, a large number of us industrialists and businessmen have made some progress in political thought, are continuing to make progress, and have made certain achievements in enterprises and various work positions, which should be affirmed. However, this progress is sometimes fast and sometimes slow, sometimes advancing and sometimes retreating, with reversals in progress, meaning that this progress has not yet reached the point of changing the political stance. From the current situation in Guangdong's industrial and commercial circles, especially after the development of the people's commune, it can be seen that we industrialists and businessmen still have doubts about the leadership of the Party, are still resistant to accepting socialist transformation, and in work and labor, there is still a performance of working without energy and being content with being in the middle. Compared with the working people, and measured by Chairman Mao's six political criteria, there is still a big gap, which shows that the dual nature of us industrialists and businessmen still exists, and the problem of the two roads has not yet been resolved. At present, a considerable portion of the industrial and commercial circles in Guangdong Province overestimate their progress, showing complacency, relaxation, and the idea that "transformation is almost complete." This idea hinders the continued progress of industrialists and businessmen.

For this reason, the Guangdong Provincial Working Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association and the Guangdong Provincial Federation of Industry and Commerce convened a joint enlarged meeting of the two associations' committees for eleven days in early April to convey and implement the spirit of the central January meeting of the two associations. We used the gentle breeze and fine rain method of laying out the facts and reasoning to open up our minds and freely discuss the issue of the direction and method of transformation in our thinking. The meeting finally reached a common understanding and unanimously agreed that to give play to the enthusiasm of industrialists and businessmen, bring into play all potential forces, and mobilize all positive factors, so that all industrialists and businessmen can be like workers and peasants, exert full energy, strive for the upper reaches, and contribute their strength without reservation for building socialism in a more, faster, better, and more economical way, it is necessary to take political thought as the commander, that is to say, first of all, we must continue to carry out fundamental transformation in political stance and thinking, so that industrialists and businessmen can improve their understanding and truly and sincerely serve socialism.

Our country has been rapidly changing its face in recent years. The task of the socialist revolution has basically resolved the struggle between the two roads of socialism and capitalism. The work of socialist construction has completed and overfulfilled the state's First Five-Year Plan, and achieved a brilliant victory with the unprecedented leap forward development speed in 1958. On this basis, it is now required to mobilize the people of the whole country at double the speed to continue to exert full energy, strive for the upper reaches, and build socialism in a more, faster, better, and more economical way, and strive to achieve a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in 1959, to complete and overfulfill the targets of 18 million tons of steel production, 380 million tons of coal production, 1050 billion catties of grain production, and 100 million piculs of cotton production. Under the leadership of the Guangdong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, Guangdong will also strive to achieve this year's grain and steel production targets. These things precisely demonstrate that our motherland, our Guangdong, is continuing to change its face at a rate of a thousand miles a day. After only three days, we must look at it with new eyes. In a short period of time, the rivers and mountains are no longer recognizable.

First, it is necessary to solve the problem of political thought, unload the burden, and move forward lightly.

This is an era where one day equals twenty years. The workers, peasants, and laborers of the whole country are standing at the forefront of the Great Leap Forward with enthusiasm, following the general line, and working selflessly without considering rewards in order to achieve a greater leap forward this year. What should we industrialists and businessmen do in the face of such a Great Leap Forward situation? We believe that we must follow the workers and peasants, continue to participate in the Great Leap Forward, strengthen the transformation of our political stance, eliminate concerns, overcome feelings of inferiority, work actively, and contribute more strength to the socialist cause. However, some of us industrialists and businessmen lack confidence in continuing the Great Leap Forward in 1959. These people do not realize that the temporary difficulties in the process of advancement can be completely overcome. The achievements of the Great Leap Forward last year were enormous. Taking Guangdong's fiscal revenue as an example, it was 1.33 billion yuan in 1957, an increase of 50.65 percent compared with 1952, while it was 1.98 billion yuan in 1958, an increase of 48.8 percent compared with 1957. As for the development of hog production, the total number of hogs raised in the province in 1958 was 19.8 million, an increase of 47.33 percent compared with 13.4 million in 1957. The living standards of farmers have improved rapidly. According to a survey of canteens in seven production teams in Huancheng, Xinhui, before the commune, poor peasants generally ate 5 to 6 liang of meat and 7 to 8 liang of fish per month, while upper-middle peasants ate 12 to 13 liang of meat and 1.5 to 2 jin of fish per month. Now, the consumption situation in the canteens is the same for everyone, and on average, each person eats 17 liang of meat and 23 liang of fish per month, which is a relatively common phenomenon. It is estimated that 400,000 more pigs have been eaten in rural areas recently. In the past, farmers were "selling flower girls with bamboo leaves," but now they are "taking advantage of their proximity to the water." Farmers do not have to pay for meals, they receive monthly wages, and their living standards have improved, so it is right to eat more. In addition, the urban population has increased, and the number of employees has also increased. In Guangdong Province, the number of employees increased from 1.42 million in early 1958 to 2.37 million in early 1959, an increase of 950,000. This has greatly increased purchasing power. Therefore, the market supply has become tight. The Guangdong Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial People's Committee are studying this issue in accordance with the spirit of the Seventh Plenary Session and are making appropriate adjustments and solutions. This problem is a temporary difficulty, and it is also a difficulty in the process of advancement, which can be solved. These problems are just a matter of nine fingers and one finger. We should not exaggerate the shortcomings and negate the achievements, nor should we think that some problems have emerged in the process of the Great Leap Forward, and then lack confidence, hold a skeptical and wait-and-see attitude, and stop moving forward. If we industrialists and businessmen have this attitude, it reflects that we still have duality, which shows that we must strengthen transformation, and proves that we must solve the problem in political thinking first in order to serve the greater Great Leap Forward in 1959, contribute our strength, and make achievements. Otherwise, we will always be carrying a burden, and we will advance and retreat from time to time, unable to move forward lightly.

Following the Party on the socialist road, industrialists and businessmen have unlimited bright prospects.

In recent years, Guangdong's transformation of capitalist industry and commerce has achieved great success. Practice has proven that the transformation of bourgeois elements is a long-term, arduous, and repeated process; practice has also proven that it is possible to gradually transform bourgeois elements into self-reliant laborers who meet the six political criteria through the policy of peaceful transformation and redemption. Political arrangements, fixed interest, and high salaries were given after whole-industry joint operation, and education was conducted in a timely manner during the anti-Rightist struggle and the rectification movement; after the people's commune movement, resistance and resistance emotions emerged, and help was given in a timely manner, and alarms were sounded; this time, the central meeting of the two associations announced the "Five Unchanged" policy (fixed interest unchanged, high salaries unchanged, political status arrangements unchanged, academic titles unchanged, and peaceful transformation policy unchanged) and earnestly implemented the spirit of gentle breeze and fine rain. Furthermore, from the situation reflected in the joint (enlarged) meeting of the committees of the two associations in Guangdong Province in April this year, this also proves this point. Opening up our minds, boldly debating, raising questions, and demanding solutions are concrete manifestations of leaning towards the Party. The facts are a good illustration. This meeting of the two associations in our province not only implemented the spirit of the central meeting, studied and discussed the issue of strengthening transformation, actively serving, and the ways and methods of transformation, but also fully discussed the transformation of medium-sized and small households (including small vendors) in the bourgeois category based on the specific situation in Guangdong, whether family members of industrialists and businessmen should also be transformed, whether transformation is glorious and the issue of canceling class relations, and also debated whether the positive aspect of industrialists and businessmen is the mainstream or the negative aspect is the mainstream. The discussion of these issues shows that we industrialists and businessmen have begun to negate our own defensive state of "only saying three points to anyone" and "being good at crookedness to say more." This joint (enlarged) meeting of the Guangdong Provincial Democratic National Construction Association and the Federation of Industry and Commerce was very successful. Through this meeting, the direction and method of transformation for industrialists and businessmen in the future have been further clarified. They are generally satisfied with the more gentle breeze and fine rain method adopted for future transformation, and once again deeply felt the Party's warmth and care for industrialists and businessmen, and unanimously expressed that they will resolutely implement the spirit of the central and provincial meetings of the two associations with practical actions, strengthen transformation in active service, and closely combine transformation and service. Now, various parts of Guangdong Province are conducting meeting transmissions one after another. After the meeting, many cities and counties have also formulated methods and measures to invest in the greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in 1959 and put them into action. These also reflect that through the path of peaceful transformation, the bourgeoisie is gradually transforming from an exploiter to a self-reliant laborer. The future of industrialists and businessmen is infinitely bright. Following the Party and taking the socialist road should be extremely glorious.

专栏：

　　工商业者，拿出更多的力量来
    郭棣活　邓文钊  黄洁　陈秋安代表的联合发言主席、各位代表：
    我们完全同意和拥护周恩来总理的“政府工作报告”和李富春副总理，李先念副总理，彭真副委员长的报告，并且坚决遵照报告的指示精神，积极努力为其实现而奋斗。
    最近西藏一小撮反动分子，在西藏发动叛乱失败后，逃到印度去同帝国主义和外国反动派勾结起来，企图搞所谓西藏“独立”。我们很惊异和愤慨。听到在四月十八日印度外交官员散发一个漏洞百出、颠倒黑白的所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”和听到在印度报刊上干涉主义分子对我国的诋毁和诬蔑。中印两国从来都是友好的邻邦，是“五项原则”的倡议者，而最近在印度发生的与西藏有关事情，都是使中印两国的友好关系和五项原则遭到严重威胁。我们绝不能让干涉主义分子利用这种友谊来干涉中国的内政。中国任人欺侮的时代已经一去不复返了。要继承英帝国主义侵略西藏的遗产，是不行的。我们忠告印度的朋友，为珍视中国人民和印度人民的长期友好和今后继续的友谊，为两国人民和平共处，为巩固世界和平事业，对于目前印度干涉主义分子的叫嚣和其他种种不可告人的活动，应该采取明智的决策。
    我们现在想就国家对资本主义工商业进行社会主义改造问题，根据广东省的情况，发表一点意见。
    广东工商业者思想认识有所进步，但政治立场还没有改变，不能对自己的进步估计过高
    广东省和全国各地一样，国家对资本主义工商业采取和平改造赎买政策，几年来对资本主义工商业进行了社会主义的改造，把资本主义企业改造为公私合营的社会主义性质的企业，已经以生产资料的全民所有制代替了生产资料的资本主义所有制，完成了企业的改组改造工作；同时，对我们工商业者进行了人的改造和做了一系列的工作，在经济上给予定息，还维持高薪，在政治上也有适当的安排，并且通过工作、劳动、学习和社会生活的实践，通过一系列的教育和锻炼，逐步地要把一个剥削者改造为一个自食其力的劳动者。从几年的实践证明，党和政府对资产阶级所采取的这种赎买政策是完全正确的，是能够使资产阶级分子通过和平改造的道路平平稳稳地过渡到社会主义去的。
    广东工商业者在党的正确领导下，经过了一系列的运动和教育，经过了反右派斗争和整风运动的锻炼和考验，和以人民公社为中心内容的社会主义、共产主义教育，政治觉悟有了一定程度的提高，思想认识继续有所进步，表现在社会主义建设事业的进程中，在企业和各种工作岗位上尽到了自己的职责。在一九五八年的大跃进中，不少人积极响应党的号召，参加了各项中心工作，发挥了一定的力量，在企业的双献运动中，贡献了才能和技术，很多人有好的表现，取得了成绩。
    正如上面举的一些事实，我们工商业为数众多的人在政治思想上有所进步，而且继续进步和在企业以及各种工作岗位上做出一定的成绩，这是应当肯定的。但是，这种进步还是有快有慢，时快时慢，有进有退，时进时退，在前进中有反复，在反复中前进的，也就是说这一进步还没有达到政治立场改变的程度。从当前广东工商界，特别是人民公社化开展后许多事实可以说明，我们工商业者对党的领导还有疑虑，接受社会主义改造还有抵触，在工作、劳动中还有干而无劲甘居中游的表现，和劳动人民比较，用毛主席的六项政治标准衡量，还有很大的距离，这就说明我们工商业者的两面性还存在，两条道路的问题还未解决。目前我们广东省工商界有相当一部分人由于对自己的进步估计过高，出现了自满松劲情绪和“改造差不多了”的思想。这种思想对工商业者继续前进是有妨碍的。
    为此，我们中国民主建国会广东省工作委员会和广东省工商业联合会，于今年四月上旬召开了为时十一天的传达和贯彻两会中央一月会议精神的两会委员联席扩大会议。运用了和风细雨摆事实讲道理的方法，敞开思想，自由讨论，在思想上解决改造的方向和方法问题。会议最后取得了共同的认识，一致认为要发挥工商业者的积极性，发挥所有的潜在力量，调动一切积极因素，使所有的工商业者都能够做到和工人农民一样，鼓足干劲，力争上游，为多快好省地建设社会主义而毫无保留地贡献力量，就必须以政治思想为统帅，也就是说，首先要在政治立场和思想方面继续进行根本的改造，才能使工商业者提高认识，真正地心悦诚服为社会主义服务。
    我们的国家几年来在迅速地改变着自己的面貌。社会主义革命的任务，基本上解决了社会主义和资本主义两条道路的斗争问题；社会主义建设工作，在完成和超额完成了国家的第一个五年计划，并且以史无前例的飞跃发展速度，实现了一九五八年的大跃进，取得了辉煌的胜利。在这一基础上，现在又要求以加倍的速度，动员全国人民继续鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地进行社会主义建设，为实现一九五九年更大更好更全面的跃进，为完成和超额完成钢的产量一千八百万吨，煤产量三亿八千万吨，粮食产量一万零五百亿斤，棉花产量一亿担的指标而努力奋斗。我们广东在中共广东省委的领导下，也要为实现今年的粮食和钢的生产指标而奋斗。这些正说明了我们的祖国，我们的广东，在以一日千里的速度继续改变着自己的面貌，真是三日不见，须当刮目相看，曾几何时，江山已不可复识矣。
    必须首先解决政治思想问题，卸掉包袱，轻装前进
    这正是一天等于二十年的时代，全国的工人、农民和劳动者正在如火如荼地站在大跃进的前列，遵循着总路线，鼓足冲天干劲，在为实现今年更大跃进而不计报酬地忘我劳动，我们工商业者面临着这样大跃进的形势，又该怎么办呢？我们认为必须跟工人和农民一道，继续参加大跃进，加强改造自己的政治立场，消除顾虑，克服自卑感，积极地工作，为社会主义事业贡献更多的力量。但是我们工商业者有些人对一九五九年继续大跃进有些信心不足。这些人没有认识到暂时的前进中的困难是完全可以克服的。去年大跃进的成绩是巨大的，以广东的财政收入为例，一九五七年为十三亿三千万元，和一九五二年比较增长了百分之五十点六五，而一九五八年则为十九亿八千万元，比一九五七年增长百分之四十八点八；再以生猪的生产发展情况而论，一九五八年全省总饲养量为一千九百八十万头，比一九五七年一千三百四十万头增加百分之四十七点三三。农民生活水平迅速提高了。从新会环城七个生产队的食堂调查，公社化前一般贫农每月吃肉五至六两，吃鱼七至八两，上中农每月吃肉十二至十三两，吃鱼一斤半至二斤。现在食堂的消费情况，大家都是一样了，而且平均一月每人吃肉十七两，吃鱼二十三两，这是比较普遍的现象。据估计最近农村多吃了四十万头猪，过去农民是“卖花姑娘插竹叶”，现在是“近水楼台先得月”了。农民吃饭不要钱，按月发工资，生活好转了，多吃点是应该的。还有城市人口增加，职工人数也增加了，广东全省去年一年间职工人数就由一九五八年初的一百四十二万人增加到一九五九年初的二百三十七万人，增加九十五万人。这就大大增加了购买力。因此市场供应呈现了紧张。这个问题广东省委和省人委正在遵照七中全会精神进行研究，并作适当的调整和解决。这个问题是一个暂时的困难，也是前进中的困难，是可以解决的。而这些问题只是九个指头与一个指头的问题，我们不应夸大缺点，否定成绩，也不应该认为在大跃进过程中出现一些问题，就信心不足，抱着怀疑观望的态度，裹足不前。我们工商业者如果存这在种态度，正反映了自己还有两面性，说明了我们还要加强改造，证明了我们要为一九五九年更大的大跃进服务，贡献力量，作出成绩，就必须在政治思想上首先解决问题，否则，始终还是背着一个包袱，会时进时退，不能轻装前进。
    工商业者跟着党走社会主义道路，前途无限光明
    几年来广东的对资改造工作是取得了巨大的成绩的，从实践证明，资产阶级分子的改造是一个长期的、艰巨的、反复的过程；从实践也证明，通过了和平改造赎买政策是可以逐步把资产阶级分子改造成为符合于六项政治标准的自食其力的劳动者的。全业合营后给予政治上的安排和定息、高薪，在反右派斗争和整风运动中及时地进行教育；人民公社化运动后出现了抵触和抗拒情绪，又及时地给予帮助，敲起了警钟；这次两会中央会议宣布“五不变”（定息不变，高薪不变，政治地位安排不变，学衔不变，和平改造政策不变）政策，并且认真地贯彻了和风细雨的精神。再从我们广东省两会今年四月召开的委员联席（扩大）会议所反映的情况看来，也就证明了这一点。思想敞开，大胆争辩，提出问题，要求解决，这就是靠拢党的具体表现。事实就是一个很好的说明，我们省两会这次会议，不只是贯彻了中央会议精神，研究和讨论了加强改造积极服务和改造的方式方法问题，还根据广东的具体情况，全面地讨论了资产阶级范畴中的中、小户（包括小商贩）的改造问题，工商业者家属是否也要改造的问题，改造是否光荣和取消阶级关系问题，也还争辩过工商业者以积极一面为主流，还是以消极一面为主流的问题。这些问题的讨论，说明了我们工商业者已开始否定自己的“逢人但说三分话”和“好歪只为多开口”的戒备状态了。这次广东省民建、工商联两会联席（扩大）会议开得很好，通过这次会议，对工商业者今后改造的方向和方法进一步明确了。他们普遍对今后改造采取更和风细雨的方法感到满意，并又一次深刻体会到党对工商业者的温暖和关怀，一致表示要以实际行动坚决贯彻两会中央和省两会会议决议精神，在积极服务中加强改造，把改造和服务密切结合起来。现在广东省各地正在纷纷进行会议传达，不少市县通过会议后，还订出投入一九五九年更大更好更全面跃进的办法和措施，并且见之行动。这些也正反映了资产阶级经过和平改造的道路，正在由一个剥削者逐步向自食其力的劳动者转化过程当中，工商业者的前途是无限光明，跟着党，走社会主义的道路，应该是异常光荣的。
