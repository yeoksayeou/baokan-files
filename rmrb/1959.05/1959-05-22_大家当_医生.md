Everyone Acts as "Doctor"
    Kǒng Sāng

To cure a disease, a doctor first diagnoses it, and then prescribes medication. If the source of the illness is found and the medicine is right for the disease, the cure will be effective. Curing the "diseases" of product quality and engineering quality is the same as curing human illnesses. You must first find the source of the problem before proposing improvement measures.

So, how do you diagnose the "diseases" of product quality and engineering quality? And who should do the diagnosing? The best method is to combine the efforts of the masses and experts to diagnose and treat together. The experience of the Tianjin No. 2 Cast Iron Factory in this regard is worthy of attention.

The factors that cause product and engineering quality to be less than ideal are often complex, including raw materials, equipment, operation, management, and people's understanding. Therefore, mobilizing everyone to speak out freely, everyone to act as "doctor," and everyone to "diagnose" allows for a more comprehensive search, by product, part, and process, looking from a technical perspective, a management perspective, an operational perspective, and from the perspective of people's ideological understanding. Everyone can express their opinions, laying out all aspects of the various contradictions. In this way, it is easier to see where the root of the problem lies, and the proposed improvement measures will be more practical. Moreover, the process of workers speaking out freely is also a process of self-education, raising awareness, and enhancing a sense of responsibility. Therefore, through thematic speaking out, not only can problems be identified more easily, and better measures proposed, but also ideological preparations can be made for the next step of implementing these measures. Why was the Tianjin No. 2 Cast Iron Factory only able to determine that improving the quality of castings would be the center of the increased production and conservation red flag competition movement in early May, and then, from May 11th to 18th, the factory's casting acceptance rate was able to increase from 60% to about 94%? The fundamental reason is the mobilization of the masses to speak out freely on specific topics, with everyone acting as "doctor." Of course, mobilizing the masses of workers to speak out, find the source of the problem, and come up with solutions also includes experts. The role of experts should not be ignored at any time. On the one hand, the improvement measures proposed by the masses need to be appraised by experts; on the other hand, some major quality problems also need experts to study together with the masses. Therefore, while mobilizing the masses of workers to speak out, find the source of the problem, and come up with solutions, there must also be a "three-way combination" of leading cadres, engineering and technical personnel, and workers, bringing together the wisdom of all three parties. The experience of the Tianjin No. 2 Cast Iron Factory in organizing a "speaking out consultation" of the three-way combination to solve the shrinkage problem of the large wheel of the coal washing machine, so that the acceptance rate of castings reached 100%, illustrates this point.

    大家当“医生”
    孔桑
    医生治病，首先是诊，其次才是开药方。病源找着了，对症下药，药到才能病除。治产品质量和工程质量的病，跟治人的病一样，也得先找病源，然后提出改进的措施。
    那么，产品质量和工程质量的病怎样诊呢？依靠谁来诊呢？最好的办法，就是群众同专家结合，共同来诊，共同来治。在这方面天津第二铸铁厂的经验是值得重视的。
    造成产品和工程质量不够好的因素，往往比较复杂，有原材料方面的，有设备方面的，有操作方面的，有管理方面的，还有人们的认识方面的，所以发动大家鸣放，大家当“医生”，大家“诊断”，才可以比较全面地按产品、部件、工序分头去找，从技术方面找，从管理方面找，从操作方面找，从人们的思想认识方面去找，各抒己见，把各种矛盾的各个侧面都摆出来。这样，病根在哪里，就比较容易看得清楚，提出的改进措施也就比较切合实际些。而且职工鸣放的过程，同时就是自我教育、提高觉悟、提高责任感的过程。所以，通过专题鸣放，不只可以比较容易发现问题，可以提出比较好的措施，还可以为下一步贯彻执行这些措施作好思想准备。天津第二铸铁厂为什么在5月初才确定以提高铸件质量为增产节约红旗竞赛运动的中心，到5月11日至18日，全厂铸件正品率就能够从60％提高到94％左右呢？根本原因就是发动群众专题鸣放，大家当“医生”。当然，发动职工群众鸣放，找病源，想办法，其中也包括专家在内，专家的作用在任何时候都不能忽视。一方面，群众提出来的改进措施，需要专家鉴定；另一方面，有些重大的质量问题，也需要专家同群众一起共同研究。所以，在发动职工群众鸣放，找病源，想办法的同时，还得有领导干部、工程技术人员和工人“三结合”，把三方面的智慧集中起来。天津第二铸铁厂组织三结合的“鸣放会诊”，解决洗煤机大轮的缩孔问题，使铸件的正品率达到百分之百的经验，就说明了这个道理。
