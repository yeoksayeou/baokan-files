Comrade Chairman, Fellow Delegates, Fellow Committee Members:

I fully endorse the work reports of Premier Zhou, Vice Premier Li Fuchun, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and Vice Chairman Li Weihan.

Premier Zhou's government work report summarized the unprecedented great achievements made by the Chinese people on all fronts under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao during the First Five-Year Plan and the first year of the Second Five-Year Plan. In particular, the comprehensive and massive leap forward achieved in 1958 under the brilliant illumination of the Party's General Line has written an extremely glorious and splendid page in China's history. In 1958, China's production of steel, coal, cotton, and grain more than doubled compared to 1957. This astonishing speed was not only an impossible dream in old China under reactionary rule, but also beyond the reach of capitalist countries. Therefore, the people of the whole country are not only jubilant and striving to complete the glorious and great tasks of 1959, but also confidently taking great strides towards socialist and communist construction.

People's Communes turn the millennia-old ideal of "the old being cared for, the able-bodied employed, the young nurtured, and the widowed, orphaned, and disabled all provided for" into reality.

In the situation of the great leap forward in all work in 1958, a new and great initiative emerged in the social organization of our country's rural areas, that is, the people's communes combining industry, agriculture, commerce, education, and military affairs, and integrating government administration with commune management, established in rural areas according to the needs of production development and the enthusiastic demands of farmers.

People's communes have demonstrated their unparalleled superiority and great vitality in all aspects. After the establishment of the people's communes, I and some of our cadres went to the communes to work and learn. I personally witnessed the heroic and enthusiastic spirit of the broad masses of farmers in building socialism, which truly moved me!

Because of communization, it is possible to organize manpower and material resources on a larger scale for production. Children are sent to nurseries and kindergartens, and elderly people who have lost their ability to work are sent to homes for the elderly. Farmers who have been worried about food for thousands of years now eat without paying, and have obtained the most reliable social security. This has turned the ideal of "the old being cared for, the able-bodied employed, the young nurtured, and the widowed, orphaned, and disabled all provided for," which the Chinese people have imagined for thousands of years, into reality. It has also thoroughly liberated women who have been bound to the stove for thousands of years, and enabled them to participate in various production labor and social activities. Farm tool factories, fertilizer factories, and other small-scale industries have been established in rural areas. Many farmers have entered self-run red and expert schools. Young and middle-aged people in rural areas, in order to protect their victorious achievements and happy lives, actively learn military technology in their spare time from labor. This kind of people's commune combining industry, agriculture, commerce, education, and military affairs is not only the best organizational form for realizing the transition from socialist collective ownership to ownership by the whole people, and from socialism to communism in our country's rural areas, but also an incomparably powerful reserve force for maintaining social order and defending the motherland's national defense.

However, the imperialists and their rumor-mongers say that what we are implementing here is "slave labor" and "destruction of the family system." Let these imperialist gentlemen listen to the words of our own farmers! I personally heard a 59-year-old commune member, Zheng Laoshan, say: "In the old society, I worked as a farmhand for the landlord, eating poorly and dressing poorly. Now, our commune members eat in the canteen and have sewing groups for clothes. I just want to do more work for the commune and realize socialism as soon as possible." Women feel it even more deeply. Female commune member Gao Bianyou said: "In the past, I took care of children, ground flour, sewed clothes, and cooked meals, and I was busy all day long. Adults and children still often couldn't get enough to eat or wear. Now, we eat in the canteen and send our children to nurseries. Flour mills and sewing groups have replaced women's manual labor. If it weren't for the establishment of the commune, we would never have such happiness." This is what the imperialists call our "slave labor" and "destruction of the family." Let these imperialists shout there. Premier Zhou said what the 650 million people feel in their hearts: "Chinese workers and peasants have lost nothing except the freedom to be unemployed and starve." At the same time, farmers, based on their own experiences, believe that with the development of commune production, their lives will become happier and more fulfilling day by day in the future. Therefore, their labor enthusiasm is even higher, and their enthusiasm for building socialism is even more abundant.

The Chinese people have always cherished the friendly relations with the people of all countries, but at the same time, the unity of the motherland and the solidarity of all nationalities must not be damaged in the slightest.

Just as the people of all ethnic groups in our country are united around the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao with elation and unparalleled excitement, building their own happy lives, a small handful of upper-class reactionary groups in Tibet colluded with imperialism and foreign reactionaries, vainly attempting to undermine national unity, split the unification of the motherland, restore the imperialist aggressive forces in Tibet, and preserve their dark, backward, reactionary, and cruel serf system, and openly launched armed rebellion, burning, killing, looting, and committing all kinds of evil. This heinous crime of violating the will of the people and undermining the unity of the motherland not only aroused the anger of the Tibetan people, but also aroused the unanimous indignation of the people of all ethnic groups across the country. "Suppression of the rebellion, defending the unity of the motherland" is the unanimous call of the 650 million people. Therefore, under the circumstances of doing everything possible with benevolence and righteousness, and being unable to bear it any longer, our Central People's Government ordered the PLA troops stationed in Tibet to carry out the suppression of the rebellion in order to safeguard the unity of the motherland and national unity, and rescue the Tibetan people. With the assistance of the Tibetan people, the rebellion was quelled and order was restored in Lhasa in just a few days. The central government also ordered the dissolution of the original Tibetan local government, and the Preparatory Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region to exercise local functions and powers. This wise measure has been unanimously and warmly supported by the people of the whole country, and first of all by the broad masses of working people in Tibet. These facts prove that the Tibetan people deeply hate the dark rule of the reactionary elements. Those imperialist reactionaries and Indian expansionists should be clear-headed in the face of these facts. Tibet has always been Chinese territory, which is well known to people all over the world. Suppressing the Tibetan rebellion is purely China's internal affair, and no foreigner has the right to interfere. After the Dalai Lama was abducted to India, under the coercion of reactionary elements, he issued the so-called "Dalai Lama's statement," which clearly shows that this statement is purely fabricated by reactionary elements and imperialist elements. Strangely, this political document slandering the Chinese people can be distributed by Indian diplomatic officials. Does this conform to the spirit of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence? We remind those imperialist elements and Indian expansionists that they should clearly realize that the era in which imperialism controlled China's internal affairs has passed! Any of your ulterior motives are destined to fail. The liberated Chinese people have always cherished the independence and unity of the motherland, and have always cherished the friendly relations with the people of all countries. However, we must never sacrifice the independence and unity of the motherland or allow any damage to national unity because we cherish this kind of friendly relationship. This is the unanimous view of the 650 million people. It is also the voice of justice. I hope you will clear your heads and not seek a shameful failure for yourselves.

专栏：

    人民公社把千年理想化为现实
    董其武代表的发言主席团、各位代表、各位委员：
    我完全拥护周总理、李富春副总理、李先念副总理、彭真副委员长、李维汉副主席的各项工作报告。
    周总理的政府工作报告，总结了我国第一个五年计划期间和第二个五年计划的第一年，我国人民在党中央和毛主席的英明领导下，在各个战线上所取得的史无前例的伟大成就。特别是一九五八年在党的总路线的光辉照耀下，取得了全面的、巨大的跃进，在我国历史上写下了极其光辉灿烂的一页。一九五八年我国的钢煤棉粮的产量，比一九五七年都增加了一倍以上。这种惊人的速度，不但在反动统治下的旧中国是不可梦想的事，就是在资本主义国家，也是望尘莫及的。因此全国人民不仅欢欣鼓舞，为完成一九五九年光荣伟大的任务而奋斗，并且满怀信心地为社会主义建设和共产主义建设大踏步的迈进。
    人民公社把几千年人们所想像的“老有所终，壮有所用，幼有所长，鳏寡孤独废疾者皆有所养”的理想变成现实
    在一九五八年各项工作大跃进的形势下，我国农村在社会组织方面，出现了一个新的、伟大的创举，那就是根据生产发展的需要和农民的热烈要求，在农村建立起来的工农商学兵相结合的、政社合一的人民公社。
    人民公社在各方面显示了它的无比优越性和伟大的生命力。在人民公社建立后，我和我们一些干部，曾到公社一边劳动，一边参观学习。我亲眼看到广大农民那种气壮山河、热情洋溢的建设社会主义的气魄，确实使我非常感动！
    由于公社化了，因而可以在更大范围内，组织人力、物力进行生产。孩子们送进了托儿所、幼儿园，丧失劳动力的老年人都进了敬老院。几千年来为着吃饭发愁的农民，现在是吃饭不要钱，得到了最可靠的社会保险。这才把我国人民几千年来所想像的“老有所终，壮有所用，幼有所长，鳏寡孤独废疾者皆有所养”的理想，变成了现实。并且使几千年来捆缚在锅灶旁的妇女，得到了彻底解放，参加了各种生产劳动和社会活动。农具厂、肥料厂及其他各种小型工业，在农村纷纷建立起来。不少农民走进了自办的红专学校。农村中的青壮年，为保卫自己的胜利果实和幸福生活，自动的在劳动空隙时间，积极学习军事技术。这样一种工农商学兵相结合的人民公社，不但是实现我国农村由社会主义的集体所有制过渡到全民所有制，由社会主义过渡到共产主义的最好组织形式，而且是维护社会安宁和保卫祖国国防的无比强大的后备力量。
    但是帝国主义和他们的造谣家，却说我们这里实行的是什么“奴隶劳动”、“破坏了家庭制度”。请这些帝国主义先生们听听我国农民自己的话吧！我亲耳听到五十九岁的社员郑老善说：“旧社会我给地主扛长工，吃不好，穿不好，现在我们公社社员，吃饭有食堂，穿衣有缝纫组，我只想给公社多作点活，早日实现社会主义。”妇女们感受更深，女社员高便友说：“从前看孩子磨面，缝衣做饭，整天忙的不可开交，大人孩子还是经常吃不饱，穿不暖。现在吃饭进食堂，孩子送到托儿所。面粉厂、缝纫组代替了妇女的手工劳动。要不是成立公社，永远不会有这样的幸福。”这就是帝国主义者嘴里所说的我们的“奴隶劳动”和“破坏了家庭”。让这些帝国主义者在那里叫喊吧，周总理说出了六亿五千万人民心里的话：“我国的工人和农民除了失去了失业和挨饿的自由以外，什么也没有失掉。”同时，农民根据他们亲身体验，相信随着公社生产的发展，今后他们的生活，将一天天更加幸福美满。因而劳动热情更加高涨，建设社会主义的积极性更加充沛。
    中国人民一向珍视各国人民的友好关系，但同时也不能使祖国统一和各民族的团结受到丝毫损害
    正当我国各族人民以兴高采烈无比兴奋的心情，团结在党中央和毛主席的周围，建设自己幸福生活的时候，而西藏一小撮上层反动集团，竟勾结帝国主义和外国反动派，妄想破坏民族团结，分裂祖国统一，恢复帝国主义在西藏的侵略势力，保存他们的黑暗的、落后的、反动的、残酷的农奴制度，公开发动武装叛乱，烧杀淫掠，无恶不作。这种违背人民意志，破坏祖国统一的滔天罪行，不但激起了西藏人民的愤怒，而且激起了全国各族人民的一致愤慨。“讨平叛逆，捍卫祖国统一”这是六亿五千万人民的一致呼声。因而我中央人民政府在仁至义尽，忍无可忍的情况下，为维护祖国统一和民族团结，拯救西藏人民，才命令中国人民解放军驻藏部队进行平叛，在西藏人民协助下，不两日即荡平了叛乱，恢复了拉萨治安。中央并明令解散原西藏地方政府，由西藏自治区筹备委员会行使地方职权。这一英明措施，受到全国人民的一致热烈拥护，首先是受到了西藏广大劳动人民的热烈拥护。这些事实证明了西藏人民对于反动分子的黑暗统治，深恶痛绝。那些帝国主义反动派和印度扩张主义分子，应当在这些事实面前清醒些。西藏，从来就是中国的领土，这是世界各国人所共知的，平定西藏叛乱，纯粹是中国的内政，任何外国人无权干涉。达赖喇嘛被劫往印度后，在反动分子的挟持下，发表了所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”，可以清楚地看出，这个声明纯粹是反动分子和帝国主义分子捏造出来的。奇怪的是，这种污蔑中国人民的政治性文件，竟能从印度外交官员之手散发出来，难道这符合和平共处的五项原则的精神吗？我们提醒那些帝国主义分子和印度的扩张主义分子，应当清楚地认识到：帝国主义摆布中国内政的时代已经过去了！你们的任何不可告人的阴谋，都注定是要失败的。解放了的中国人民，一向珍视祖国的独立与统一，也一向珍视同各国人民的友好关系。但是，绝不能因为珍视这一种友好关系，而使祖国独立统一受到丝毫损失和民族团结遭到任何破坏。这是六亿五千万人民一致的主张。也是正义的呼声。望你们头脑放清醒，不要自找可耻的失败。
