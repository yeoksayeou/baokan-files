Xinhua News Agency, 24th. Recently, many units of the Chinese People's Liberation Army have organized their officers and soldiers to actively support summer harvesting and planting in the people's communes where they are stationed. When a people's commune where a unit of the Nanjing military was stationed was preparing to harvest wheat, a gale of force nine suddenly blew. The unit immediately stopped training and went into action to help the commune with the emergency harvest. A people's commune where a unit was stationed had difficulty planting rice this year due to a large amount of land and a shortage of labor. After learning about this situation, the local garrison immediately went to the commune to help with watering and rice planting. One production team originally transplanted 18 mu of rice seedlings per day. On the first day of the PLA's support, they transplanted 35 mu. Afterwards, they transplanted more than 70 mu of rice seedlings every day. The officers and soldiers of the 5th Company of a certain unit have been under intense training recently. In order to support the summer harvest and planting, they got up early and worked late, and used Sundays to help the commune transplant rice seedlings. They said: "Summer harvest and planting are a race against time. We would rather sweat more than let the commune miss the agricultural season for rice transplanting."

The political department of the Chengdu military, in a notice issued to support agricultural production, required party committees at all levels to proactively contact relevant local government departments, make plans and specific arrangements for labor, and help local people's communes to harvest wheat and plant large spring crops in a timely manner. On the 10th, the officers and soldiers of a unit of this military organized a labor force of more than 1,000 people and went to Yongfeng People's Commune in the suburbs of Chengdu to help commune members harvest more than 100 mu of wheat, transport more than 3 million jin of fertilizer, plant 15 mu of rice seedlings, and plow more than 20 mu of fields.

A unit on the Fujian front transplanted more than 930 mu of rice seedlings and weeded 30 mu for the people's commune where they were stationed. Some unit leaders personally led officers and soldiers to the fields to transplant rice seedlings.

In the labor of supporting the people's communes, the various units paid attention to improving work efficiency and ensuring quality. When a unit of the Beijing military was helping the commune repair water conservancy projects, they launched a mass movement to "improve work efficiency and ensure quality."

    解放军积极支援夏收夏种
    劳动中普遍注意提高工效保证质量
    新华社24日讯　中国人民解放军许多部队最近组织广大官兵，积极支援驻地人公社夏收夏种。南京部队某部驻地人民公社准备收麦时，忽然刮起了九级大风。这个部队立刻停止了操练，全部出动，帮助公社抢收。某部驻地的人民公社因土地多，劳力少，今年插秧有困难。当地驻军知道这一情况后，立即    开赴公社，帮助车水、插秧。有个生产队原来每天插秧十八亩，部队支援的第一天，就插了三十五亩。以后每天插秧七十亩以上。某部五连的官兵，最近训练比较紧张，为了支援夏收夏种，他们起早带晚和利用星期天，帮助公社插秧。他们说：“夏收夏种分秒必争，我们宁愿多流汗，也不能使公社插秧误农时。”
    成都部队政治部在发出支援农业生产的通知中，要求各级党委主动地与当地政府有关部门联系，作出计划和具体安排劳力，帮助当地人民公社及时收割小麦和及时栽种大春作物。这个部队的某部官兵们，10日组织了一支一千多人的劳动大军，前往成都市郊永丰人民公社，帮助社员收割了一百多亩小麦，搬运了三百多万斤肥料，栽了十五亩秧苗，翻了二十多亩田。
    福建前线某部为驻地人民公社插秧九百三十多亩，拔草三十亩。有的部队首长亲自率领官兵们到田间插秧。
    各部队在支援人民公社的劳动中，注意提高工作效率和保证质量。北京部队某部在帮助公社修水利时，开展了“提高工效、保证质量”的群众运动。
