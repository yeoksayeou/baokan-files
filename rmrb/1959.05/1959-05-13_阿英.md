Without even exchanging three sentences, my sister started showering me with praise about her daughter, Aying. In my sister's eyes, Aying was already an extraordinary person: "Aying isn't like a typical girl at all; she's skilled in all kinds of farm work, both rough and delicate. She can easily carry a hundred-pound load and walk with it effortlessly. She plows the fields quickly and well, and even the older generation praises her, saying Aying is more capable than a boy. Aying is also a platoon leader, and among the two hundred-plus people in her platoon, young and old alike, everyone obeys her commands. The other day, the company commander couldn't arrange the work and even sent a letter asking Aying to come back." As she said this, my sister took out several brand-new towels from the wardrobe and said: "These are prizes Aying won for her labor. For the past year or two, I haven't had to buy a single towel for the house..."

However, in my memory, my niece Aying was not this kind of heroic figure, but a shy rural girl. This was ten years ago: In 1949, when I returned home for the first time, Aying was just a fourteen-year-old girl, with two small braids that swung back and forth. When I walked into my sister's house, Aying hid in the bedroom as soon as she saw me. My sister called Aying out and asked her to greet her uncle. At this time, Aying had no choice but to come out, gently say "Uncle," her face as red as paper, and then run out the door, not even daring to come home for dinner. At the time, my sister, fearing I would be offended, said with a smile, "This little girl Aying is just afraid of strangers." Afterward, although I visited my sister's house several times, I never managed to see Aying.

My sister seemed to have read my mind and continued to talk incessantly about Aying: "Aying is a girl that everyone likes in this area. To be honest, you won't find another girl like her here. People often come to propose marriage, no, introduce potential partners. Nowadays, we don't arrange marriages, but some older people, seeing Aying, ask matchmakers to make proposals regardless of whether their sons are willing or not. To be honest, Aying is not young anymore and should get married. But how does Aying answer? Can you guess, brother?" As she spoke, my sister paused, her eyes scanning me up and down. This isn't hard to answer; nowadays, young people find their own partners, who needs introductions? Just as I was about to reply, my sister jumped in and said, "Although you've traveled to many big places and now work in Beijing, you definitely won't guess." I was about to say, "That's not hard to answer," when my sister continued, "Aying says she's still young and it's the time to do more work. Having a man is like having an extra string tied to you; whatever you do, wherever you go, you'll be pulled by that string, and you won't be free." At this point, my sister sighed deeply. I thought: my sister must be unhappy with Aying's response. What parents don't want to hold their grandchildren early? But what my sister said wasn't exactly what I was thinking. She said, "Aying's words are very true. Like me, having a man and children, I'm not free to do or go anywhere. Aying gets up in the morning, combs her braids, and goes to the platoon to work. She attends meetings until midnight and comes back to lie in bed, without any worries. But what about me? Last time everyone signed up to go to the Yanglin water conservancy construction site to work, but I couldn't go because I have several children." As she said this, my sister glared at my brother-in-law sitting in the corner. My brother-in-law just chuckled.

The impression of Aying from ten years ago began to fade in my mind, replaced by a new image. Aying is not only a strong laborer who is skilled in both rough and delicate tasks and can compete with men, but also a young warrior who is loyal to the cause of communism. According to my sister, when the Yanglin water conservancy project had just started, the weather was still very cold, and many people were hesitant to go into the water to dig soil. Aying was the first to jump into the river barefoot to dig soil. When it was Aying's turn to take a break, someone in the team suddenly fell ill, and Aying didn't take her break but filled in for them for a day, carrying soil. Therefore, Aying only returned home for one day during the Spring Festival and has been working on the construction site ever since.

Because Aying has changed so much, when my sister invited me to see Aying at the Yanglin water conservancy construction site the next day, I decided to change my original plan—to take the 8:00 am bus back to my work area. After having some refreshments, I followed my sister to the construction site.

It's only three *li* from my home to the construction site, but we walked a full thirty *li* looking for Aying.

The Yanglin water conservancy project is quite large. The originally narrow river, only a few *zhang* wide, has now been built into a large river more than ten *zhang* wide, and it can even reach the Yangtze River. In the future, you can take a boat from here to Nanjing and Beijing. A highway has been built along the river. The project is already 90% complete, but there are still many people working on the site. It's not easy to find Aying among so many people. My sister kept asking people if they had seen Aying. I also tried to find Aying based on what I knew, that is, the image my sister had told me. Before long, a strong girl walked towards us, carrying a load of soil and walking past me briskly. I asked my sister if this was Aying. My sister shook her head and said, "She's not nearly as strong as Aying. Aying is tall and big, a head taller than you. This girl is short and small." After walking for a while, we saw a tall, big girl carrying soil and singing a labor song, walking up step by step from the deep riverbed. This must be my niece! My sister smiled and said, "This girl is similar to Aying, but she doesn't carry the soil as lightly as Aying, and her labor song isn't as pleasant as Aying's." After walking a bit further, my sister quickened her pace and caught up with a girl. I thought we had found Aying, but when I ran over and listened, they said: This wasn't Aying either. This girl told my sister, "Aying didn't come to work today." At this point, my sister started to worry about her daughter, muttering to herself:

"Aying must be sick. If she's not sick, why wouldn't she come to work?" Then she began to grumble:

"This child just won't listen. It's been two months, and she only rested for one day during the Spring Festival. How could she not get sick from being so tired!" Just then, we met the battalion commander. After asking the battalion commander, we found out that Aying wasn't sick, but was at a meeting at the battalion headquarters. My sister finally breathed a long sigh of relief, glanced at me, and, seeing that I didn't have any reaction, started talking about Aying again.

As she spoke, we unknowingly arrived at the battalion headquarters. But when we asked the staff at the battalion headquarters, we learned that the meeting had already ended and Aying had taken a load and gone to the construction site. At this time, my sister was very embarrassed. If we kept looking, we had already walked a lot and spent a lot of time; if we didn't look, the uncle wouldn't see his niece, and the niece wouldn't see her uncle. In the end, my sister said helplessly, "Let's go back!" I agreed with this suggestion. Although we didn't find Aying, I had already seen my heroic niece from the mouth of Aying's mother and from the other women working at the construction site.

    阿英

    没有说上三句话，妹妹就把自己的女儿——阿英夸个不止。在妹妹口中，阿英已经是一个不平凡的人物：“阿英就不像个女孩子，庄稼活都拿得上手，粗就粗，细就细，百把斤担子，轻轻松松担着就走，翻地又快又好，老一辈人也都夸阿英比小子还能干。阿英还是连指导员，全连二百多人，老的，小的，没一个不服阿英调派的。前几天连长安排不了活，还捎信要阿英回来。”说到这里，妹妹从衣柜里拿出几条崭新的毛巾来说：“这是阿英劳动得的奖品。这一二年来，我家里就没买过一条毛巾使用。……”
    但是，在我的记忆中，外甥女阿英并不是这样的英雄人物，而是一个羞羞答答的农村小姑娘。这还是十年前的事情：1949年我第一次回家的时候，阿英还是个十四岁的小姑娘，梳着两条小辫子，一甩一甩的。当我走进妹妹家的时候，阿英一见我就躲进了卧室。妹妹把阿英叫出来，要她见见大舅舅。这时，阿英不得不走出来，轻轻地叫了一声“大舅舅”，脸像张红纸，连奔带跳的跑到门外去了，连吃饭也不敢回家。当时，妹妹怕我见怪，就笑着说：“阿英这小姑娘就是怕见生人。”以后，我虽然接连去了妹妹家几次，可是始终没有见到阿英。
    妹妹好像已经看出了我的心思，又滔滔不绝地说着阿英的事情：“阿英，在这一段（带）是人人喜欢的姑娘，说实话，在这里也找不到第二个这样的姑娘。经常有人来说媒，不，介绍对象。现在不行说媒，可是有些老年人看到了阿英不管自己儿子愿意不愿意，就托媒人来说媒。说实话，阿英年纪也不小了，该结婚了。可是阿英怎么回答呢？哥哥你猜猜？”妹妹说着就停了下来，两只眼睛直在我的身上扫来扫去。这还不好回答，现在哪个年青人不自找对象，还要什么人介绍。我正要答复的时候，妹妹抢着先说了：“你虽然走过不少大的地方，现在又在北京工作，但是一定猜不到”。我正想说“这还难回答”，妹妹又说下去了：“阿英说，年纪还轻轻的，正是多做点工作的时候。有了男人就像在身上多拴了一根线，做什么，到哪里，都会被这根线牵着，不自由。”妹妹说到这里，长长地叹了一口气。我想：妹妹一定不满意阿英的这样说法，哪个父母不希望早点抱外孙呢？可是妹妹说出来的，却不完全是我所想的那些。她说：“阿英的话很实在，像我，有了男人，又有了孩子，做什么，到哪里，都不自由。阿英早上起来，梳梳辫子，就到连部去工作了，开会开到半夜回来，往床上一躺，什么事也没有。可是我呢？上回大家都报名上杨林水利工地去劳动，就是我有几个孩子走不了。”妹妹说到这里，朝着坐在墙角的妹夫白了一眼。妹夫只是嘻嘻笑了一笑。
    十年前的阿英的印象，在我的脑子里开始淡薄起来，由另一个新的形象来替代了。阿英不仅是一个粗粗细细都拿得上手，可以同男人一比高低的强劳动力，而且还是一个对共产主义事业忠心耿耿的年青战士。据妹妹谈，在杨林水利工程刚开始的时候，气候还十分寒冷，对下水里去掏土的工作，好多人都下不了决心。阿英就第一个赤着脚跳下河掏土。轮到阿英休假的时候，队里忽然有人病倒，阿英不休假，替人担了一天土。因此，阿英除了过春节回了一天家，一直在工地上劳动。
    正因为阿英有这样大的变化，第二天，妹妹来邀我到杨林水利工地看阿英的时候，我决定改变原来的计划——坐八时的汽车回到工作地区，吃了点心，就跟着妹妹往工地去。
    从我的家到工地，不过三里地，可是为了找阿英，却足足走了三十里地。
    杨林水利工程规模不小，原来只有丈把宽的小河，现在修成了十丈多宽的大河，而且可以通达长江。将来从这里坐上轮船可以到南京和北京。沿河修起了一条公路。工程已经完成了十分之九。但是工地上的人还是不少。在这么多的人中要寻找阿英是不容易的。妹妹一路问人看到阿英没有。我也按照着我所知道的，也就是妹妹说给我听的形象去寻找阿英。不多一会，迎面走来了一个身体坚实的姑娘，担着一担土，轻快地从我身边走过去。我问妹妹这是阿英吧？妹妹摇头说：“远没有阿英坚实，阿英的个子又高又大，比你还高出一个头。这姑娘又矮又小。”走了一段路，看到一个又高又大的姑娘，担着土，唱着劳动号子，正从很深的河床一步一步走上来。这一定是外甥女无疑了！妹妹笑一笑说：“这个姑娘和阿英差不多，可就是担着土没有阿英轻快，劳动号子也没有阿英唱得好听。”又朝前走了一段路，妹妹的步子加快起来，追上了一个姑娘。我想这可把阿英寻到了；可是，等我跑过去一听，说：原来这还不是阿英。这个姑娘告诉妹妹“阿英今天没有出工。”这时妹妹为自己的女儿耽心起来了，自言自语地说：
  “阿英一定病了，没病，为什么不出工？”接着嘟嘟哝哝埋怨起来：
  “这个孩子就是不听话，两个月了，就是春节休息了一天，怎么不累病呢！”正在这时候，碰见了营长。问了营长，才知道阿英并没有病，是在营部开会。妹妹才长长地叹了一口气，看了我一眼，大概见我没有什么表示，又说起阿英来了。
    说着说着，不觉来到了营部。可是一问营部的工作人员，会议已经结束，阿英担了担子，上工地去了。这时，妹妹很为难，再找吧，已经走了不少路，花了不少时间；不找吧，舅舅见不了外甥，外甥也见不了舅舅。最后，妹妹无可奈何地说：“回去吧！”我同意这个意见，阿英虽然没有找到，但我从阿英母亲的口中，从在工地劳动其他妇女身上，已经看到了我的那个英雄式的外甥女了。
