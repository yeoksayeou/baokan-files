Seize the Peak Season and Increase Sea Salt Production
National Salt Production in the First Four Months Increased by 26.69% Compared to the Same Period Last Year

(Our newspaper reports) In the first four months of this year, national salt production exceeded the same period last year by 26.69%, with sea salt production exceeding it by 29.33%.

At the beginning of this year, all salt fields grasped the fundamental link of vigorously launching mass movements and carrying out technical revolution and technical innovation, and launched appraisal and competition activities. With the deepening of the movement, the enthusiasm of the masses grew, and innovative measures emerged one after another, with production records constantly being refreshed. In the main sea salt regions of Liaoning, Hebei, Shandong, and Jiangsu, this year, whether in repairing beaches, producing brine, or producing salt, the work started earlier than last year, the progress was faster, and the quality was better. Tangda Salt Field in Hebei Province, after ending production in mid-December last year, made every effort to rush to repair the beaches. It only took more than twenty days of preparation time, and on January 4th this year, in the severe cold of minus ten degrees, it started ponding and production. By the end of January, the entire field's crystallization ponds were basically filled, and by the end of February, salt production reached 20,000 tons, an increase of more than ninety times compared to the same period last year, and all of them were first-class salt with more than 95% sodium chloride content, completely breaking the old convention of "seeing salt around Qingming in nine out of ten years," and turning sea salt from seasonal production to year-round production. Several sea salt regions south of Zhejiang have all seen production exceed more than double that of the same period last year.

At present, the weather is fine and warm, which is the golden season for production in the sea salt regions. Along the more than ten thousand li of coastline of the motherland, a more magnificent and grand high tide of sea salt production is forming. (Attached picture)

    抓紧旺季　增产海盐
    全国盐产量头四个月比去年同期增长26.69％
    本报讯　制盐工业在今年头四个月内，全国产盐量超过去年同期26.69％，海盐产量超过29.33％。
    今年一开始，各盐场就抓紧了大搞群众运动大闹技术革命和技术革新这个基本环节，展开了评比竞赛。随着运动的深入展开，群众干劲愈来愈大，革新措施层出不穷，生产纪录日新月异。辽宁、河北、山东、江苏几个主要海盐区，今年无论在修滩、制卤、产盐方面，都比去年动手得早，进度也快，质量也好。河北省的塘大盐场，去年12月中旬结束生产后，就全力突击修滩，仅仅用了二十多天的准备时间，今年1月4日在零下十多度的严寒中，就灌池生产，1月底全场结晶池基本灌齐，二月底产盐达二万吨，比去年同期增加九十多倍，而且都是含氯化钠95％以上的一等盐，彻底打破了“十有九年，清明见盐”的陈规，使海盐由季节性生产转变为长年生产。浙江以南的几个海盐区，产量都超过了去年同期一倍以上。
    目前，风和日暖，正是海盐区生产上的黄金季节，在祖国一万多里长的海岸线上，正在形成一个更加壮阔、更加宏伟的海盐丰产高潮。（附图片）
