    Etiquette
    Yuan Shuipai
    It is reported that the General Secretary of the Indian National Congress attended the activities of the "Delhi Tibet Affairs Committee." In Mumbai, there is also a "Support Tibet Committee" clamoring that India should "inherit" Britain's past "monopoly rights" over Tibet. "Delhi Tibet Affairs Committee," such a strange name, after considering it, it is difficult to understand its meaning. Tibet's affairs should be managed by Delhi? With frequent rain, mushrooms grow. Mumbai does not yield to the capital, and it even has a "Support Tibet Committee" showing naked expansionist ambitions. Oh, Mr. General Secretary of the Indian National Congress,
    Does China have a "Beijing Bihar Affairs Committee"?
    Or a Shanghai "Support Assam Committee"?
    Indeed, it's like a horse's head on a donkey's body! What kind of etiquette and law allows interference in another country's internal affairs? Is this just an occasional loss of control, or a deliberate indulgence in some kind of greed?

    礼节篇
    袁水拍
    报载，印度国大党总书记出席了“德里西藏事务委员会”的活动。在孟买，还有个“支援西藏委员会”，叫嚣印度要“承继”英国过去对西藏的“垄断权利”。“德里西藏事务委员会”，如此称呼忒奇怪，顾名之后难思义，西藏的事务要德里管？霉雨多，出麻菇，孟买也不让首都，再来个“支援西藏委员会”，扩张野心赤裸裸。哎哟，国大党总书记阁下，
    中国可有“北京比哈尔邦事务委员会”？
    或者上海“支援阿萨姆邦委员会”？
    是啊，真所谓牛头不对马嘴！这是什么样的礼节和法律，允许把别国的内政干预？这究竟是偶尔失去节制，还是尽量放纵某种贪欲？
