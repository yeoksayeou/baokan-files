Looking at Lhasa from Hohhot
Speech by Member Zhang Zhuoqing

　　I wholeheartedly support Premier Zhou's report on the work of the government and the reports of other leaders.

　　Our great motherland has been advancing at a rapid pace for the ten years since its founding. Especially since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, we have achieved unprecedented great achievements.

　　We can also see the profound and tremendous changes in the face of the motherland from the development of Hohhot, a city. Before liberation, Hohhot experienced hundreds of years of dark and reactionary rule, its economic foundation was extremely weak, and the people's lives were extremely difficult. In the ten years since liberation, under the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, people of all ethnic groups have undergone various political movements and social reforms, achieved great victories in the democratic revolution and socialist revolution, and made astonishing achievements in socialist construction. In 1949, at the time of liberation, there were only ten dilapidated factories with only 836 employees, in a state of semi-shutdown. After only nine short years, the modern factories of various types have developed to forty, the number of employees has increased nineteen times, and the total industrial output value has increased forty-one and a half times. The construction area of houses in the past nine years is equivalent to 1.2 times the total construction area of houses in the hundreds of years before liberation. Before liberation, there was not a single university in the city, and there were very few middle and primary schools. By the end of 1958, the city already had seven universities including Inner Mongolia University. The number of students in secondary schools increased more than threefold compared with the early days of liberation, and the number of primary school students increased more than twofold. The average social purchasing power per capita increased by 1.6 times. Especially in the Great Leap Forward of 1958, the 400,000 people of all ethnic groups in Hohhot held high the red flag of communism, created countless miracles with soaring revolutionary vigor, and achieved a comprehensive bumper harvest on the political, economic, and ideological fronts, realizing the people's communization; industrial and agricultural production doubled; and urban and rural industries flourished everywhere. The city, which had never produced iron and steel in history, now has its own "small local groups" and "large foreign groups" of iron and steel enterprises. At the beginning of liberation, the only factory belonging to the means of production was an electric light company. After the leap forward in 1958, Hohhot has now produced metallurgical equipment, coking equipment, coal washing equipment, mining equipment, irrigation and drainage machinery equipment, metal cutting lathes and various power machinery, and has become one of the main bases for iron and steel and machinery production in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. This year, Hohhot Special Steel Plant, Xinsheng Steel Plant, Integrated Motor Plant, Metallurgical Mining Machinery Plant, Machine Tool Plant, Bearing Plant, Refractory Materials Plant, United Cement Plant, Coal Mine, Oil Refinery, Rubber Plant, Chemical Plant, Power Plant, Pharmaceutical Plant, Sugar Plant, Second Woolen Mill, Daily Chemical Plant and other forty-five projects are to be newly built. Compared with 1958: steel increased 143 times, iron increased 9.5 times, coke increased 29 times, cement increased 43 times, and other types of products have increased to varying degrees. Due to the conscientious implementation of the policy of simultaneously developing light and heavy industries, light industry has also developed greatly. The sugar factory with an annual output of 22,000 tons will be put into production in the fourth quarter of this year. The existing woolen mill plans to produce 1,160 tons of wool yarn, 50,000 meters of worsted woolen fabrics, and 250,000 meters of long-haired plush this year. The variety of light industrial products will increase to more than 400, of which daily necessities alone will reach more than 200. The planned basic construction area this year is 1.04 million square meters, equivalent to 79.5% of the total basic construction area of the first five-year plan. The planned total grain output is 200 million jin, and the planned yield per mu is 4.1 times that of 1950. Other construction undertakings have also developed rapidly. Under the guidance of the national unified planning, a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward upsurge has been formed. With the great leap forward in production and the great liberation of people's minds, the communist ideological consciousness of the broad masses of workers and peasants has been greatly improved, and the technical revolution and cultural revolution have flourished; under this general situation, democratic figures from all ethnic groups and circles have undergone profound changes in their ideological outlook through the anti-rightist struggle, confiding in the Party, formulating self-transformation plans, and participating in labor training, and have actively invested in the practice of various socialist constructions, transforming themselves, and closely combining transformation and service. Many people have achieved remarkable results in the technical revolution and cultural revolution, and have taken a big step forward on the road of fundamental self-transformation.

　　In the past ten years, the people of all ethnic groups in the city have gradually transformed a consuming city into a producing city, and are now full of confidence, continuing to go all out, and striving to build a modern industrial city dominated by iron and steel and machinery.

　　Hohhot is a multi-ethnic area, with the main ethnic groups being Mongolian, Han, Hui, and Manchu. Historically, due to the long-term implementation of national oppression and national division policies by the reactionary ruling class, there was disunity and mistrust between and within ethnic groups. Mongolians and other minority ethnic groups suffered from severe political oppression, economic devastation, and social discrimination. After liberation, we have earnestly implemented the Party's ethnic policy, and Mongolians and other brotherly ethnic groups have gained political equality and truly become masters of their own affairs. In carrying out democratic reforms and socialist revolutions, we have paid attention to the characteristics of minority ethnic groups. In socialist construction, we have paid special attention to the development of the economy and culture of the Mongolian and minority ethnic groups. The customs, habits, and religious beliefs of all ethnic groups are respected. In particular, after the realization of people's communization, the relations of production have been further changed, and people of all ethnic groups have organized ethnic joint people's communes, helping and respecting each other. In addition, the people's communes are large in scope and implement diversified operations, which make it easier to arrange labor production according to the special characteristics of the Mongolian and minority ethnic groups, thereby making the relationship between people of all ethnic groups closer and more united. Everyone praises Chairman Mao and thanks the Communist Party, and deeply experiences that "listening to Chairman Mao's words and taking the socialist road" is always happiness.

　　Our Hohhot city in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and Lhasa in the Tibet region have many similarities. These two brotherly cities are both the capitals of autonomous regions; both are cities of peaceful liberation; both are on the frontier of the motherland, with a long history, but extremely weak economic foundations and culturally backward places, and both are minority ethnic areas of the motherland. The reason why Hohhot has been able to achieve such great achievements since liberation is due to the wise leadership and close concern of the Party Central Committee, Chairman Mao, and the People's Government, the people of all ethnic groups have truly become masters of their own affairs, and the sincere help of advanced ethnic groups, especially the Han ethnic group. This is a great victory for the Party and the country's ethnic policy. Our own experience proves that only under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, only in the unified family of the motherland, and with the fraternal help of advanced ethnic groups, can our minority ethnic groups have unlimited bright prospects. Since the peaceful liberation of Tibet, the Party and the government have consistently adhered to the policy of national unity, ethnic solidarity, ethnic equality, and gradual realization of ethnic regional autonomy, and gradually realizing democratic reforms in Tibet. This was the only broad road for the Tibetan people to thoroughly emancipate themselves and build a prosperous and happy life. However, due to the deliberate obstruction and sabotage of the implementation of the Seventeen-Article Agreement on the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet by the former Tibetan local government and a small handful of upper-level reactionary groups, social reforms in the Tibet region could not be actively carried out, productive forces could not be thoroughly liberated, and it was impossible to have a high tide of the Great Leap Forward like other parts of the country, making it impossible for the people of all ethnic groups in Tibet to quickly live a prosperous and happy life. Not only that, these unscrupulous national scum have even failed to live up to the meticulous care and leniency of the Central Government and Chairman Mao, and have openly colluded with imperialism to launch an armed rebellion, betray the motherland, resolutely oppose the people, and attempt to separate Tibet from the big family of the motherland and return it to the enslavement of imperialism, in order to maintain the heinous rule of this reactionary group and continue to ride roughshod over the Tibetan people. These monstrous crimes are no longer tolerated by national law. The people of all ethnic groups in Hohhot warmly support the State Council's order on dissolving the Tibetan local government and thoroughly quelling the Tibetan rebellion, and unanimously believe that this is a necessary measure to safeguard national unity, strengthen ethnic solidarity, promote the new birth of Tibet, and fully conform to the wishes and fundamental interests of the people of all ethnic groups in Tibet. We angrily denounce the criminal acts of the traitorous group! And extend our cordial greetings to the People's Liberation Army in the Tibet region and the people of all ethnic groups in Tibet! Our invincible People's Liberation Army, with the active assistance of the patriotic Tibetan people against imperialism, has quickly quelled the rebellion. This fact fully demonstrates the strong desire of the Tibetan people to get rid of poverty and backwardness and the firm will to take the road of democracy and socialism. After the Dalai Lama was abducted to India, the imperialists and foreign reactionaries openly slandered our leaders and interfered in our internal affairs, which is intolerable, and I express my great indignation at this. I solemnly warn the imperialists and foreign reactionaries, you should be sober! No one is allowed to interfere in our country's internal affairs, and any of your conspiracies and attempts will surely end in shameful failure.

　　从呼和浩特看拉萨
    张濯清委员的发言
    我衷心拥护周总理关于政府工作报告及其他各位首长的报告。
    我们伟大的祖国建国十年来，以一日千里的速度前进。尤其从一九五八年全国大跃进以来，更取得了史无前例的伟大成就。
    我们从呼和浩特市一个城市的发展情况，也可以看出祖国面貌深刻巨大的变化。呼和浩特市解放以前经历了几百年黑暗反动的统治，经济基础极其薄弱，人民生活困苦不堪。解放十年来，各族人民在党和毛主席的英明领导下，经过了各项政治运动和社会改革，取得了民主革命、社会主义革命的伟大胜利，和社会主义建设的惊人成就。一九四九年解放当时仅有十个残破不堪的工厂，职工仅有八百三十六人，处于半停工的状态。经过短短的九年，现代化的各类工厂已发展到四十个，职工人数增加了十九倍，工业生产总值增长了四十一倍半。九年来的房屋建筑面积，相当于解放前几百年房屋建筑总面积的一点二倍。解放前全市没有一座高等学校，中、小学也很少。到一九五八年底全市已有内蒙古大学等七所高等院校，中等学校在校学生比解放初增加了三倍多，小学生增加了二倍多。按人口平均社会购买力增加了一点六倍。特别是在一九五八年大跃进当中，呼和浩特市四十万各族人民高举着共产主义红旗，以冲天的革命干劲，创造出无数的奇迹，在政治、经济、思想战线上获得了全面大丰收，实现了人民公社化；工、农业生产翻了一番；城乡工业遍地开花。历史上从未生产过钢铁的城市，现在也有了自己的“小土群”和“大洋群”的钢铁企业。解放初，属于生产资料的工厂仅有一个电灯公司，经过一九五八年的跃进，现在呼和浩特市已经生产出冶金设备、炼焦设备、洗煤设备、矿山设备、排灌机械设备、金属切削车床和各种动力机械，已成为内蒙古自治区钢铁、机械生产的主要基地之一。今年要新建呼和浩特市特殊钢厂、新生钢铁厂、综合电机厂、冶金矿山机械厂、机床厂、轴承厂、耐火器材厂、联合水泥厂、煤矿、炼油厂、橡胶厂、化工厂、电厂、制药厂、糖厂、第二毛织厂、日用化工厂等四十五个项目。与一九五八年相比：钢增加一百四十三倍，铁增加九点五倍，焦炭增加二十九倍，水泥增加四十三倍，其它各类产品都有不同程度的增长。由于认真贯彻轻、重工业同时并举的方针，轻工业也有很大发展。年产二万二千吨的糖厂，今年第四季度就要投入生产。现有的毛纺厂今年计划生产毛线一千一百六十吨，精纺毛织品五万公尺，长毛绒二十五万公尺，轻工业产品品种将增加到四百多种，其中仅日用百货即达二百多种。今年的基本建设面积计划为一百零四万平方公尺，相当于第一个五年计划基本建设总面积的百分之七十九点五。粮食总产量计划达到二亿斤，亩产计划为一九五○年的四点一倍。其他各项建设事业也均有飞跃发展。在全国一盘棋的方针指导下，一个更大更好更全面的跃进高潮已经形成。随着生产大跃进，人的思想大解放，广大工农群众的共产主义思想觉悟大大提高，技术革命、文化革命大放异彩；在这一总的形势下，各族各界民主人士经过反右派斗争、向党交心、制定自我改造规划，和参加劳动锻炼，思想面貌发生了深刻的变化，积极投入各项社会主义建设的实践当中，改造自己，把改造和服务紧密结合起来。不少的人在技术革命和文化革命中取得了显著的成绩，在自我根本改造道路上向前迈进了一大步。
    十年来，全市各族人民已将一座消费的城市逐步改造为生产的城市，现正满怀信心，继续鼓足干劲，为建成一个以钢铁、机械为主的现代化工业城市而奋勇前进。
    呼和浩特市是多民族地区，主要民族有蒙族、汉族、回族、满族。历史上由于反动统治阶级长期采取民族压迫与民族分裂的政策，造成民族之间和民族内部互不团结、互不信任，蒙族和其他少数民族，受着严重的政治压迫、经济摧残和社会歧视。解放后，我们切实地贯彻了党的民族政策，蒙族和其他兄弟民族获得了政治上的平等，真正做到当家作主。在进行民主改革和社会主义革命中，注意了少数民族的特点。在社会主义建设事业中，特别注意了蒙族及少数民族经济、文化事业的发展。各民族的风俗习惯、宗教信仰受到尊重。尤其，实现人民公社化以后，生产关系进一步的改变，各族人民组织了民族联合的人民公社，互相帮助，互相尊重，加以人民公社范围大，实行多种经营，更便于根据蒙族及少数民族的特长安排劳动生产，从而使各族人民之间的关系更加亲密团结。人人歌颂毛主席、感谢共产党，并深切体验到“听毛主席的话，走社会主义路”永远是幸福。
    我们内蒙古自治区的呼和浩特市和西藏地区的拉萨有许多相似的地方。这两个兄弟的城市，同是自治区的首府；同是和平解放的城市；同是祖国边疆，历史悠久，但经济基础极其薄弱，文化落后的地方，也同是祖国的少数民族地区。呼和浩特市解放以来，所以能取得这样大的成就，是由于党中央、毛主席和人民政府的英明领导和亲切关怀，各族人民真正实现了当家作主，先进民族特别是汉民族的真诚帮助的结果。这是党和国家民族政策的伟大胜利。从我们的切身经验证明，只有在党中央和毛主席的领导下，只有在祖国统一的大家庭中，有了先进民族兄弟般的帮助，我们少数民族才有无限光明的前途。自从西藏和平解放以来，党和政府对于西藏一贯地坚持祖国统一、民族团结、民族平等和逐步实现民族区域自治，逐步实现民主改革的政策。这本是西藏人民彻底翻身，建设繁荣幸福生活的唯一康庄大道。但由于原西藏地方政府和一小撮上层反动集团蓄意阻挠和破坏和平解放西藏十七条协议的实现，使西藏地区的社会改革不能积极进行，生产力得不到彻底解放，也就不可能和全国各地一样出现大跃进的高潮，使西藏各族人民迅速过着繁荣幸福的生活。不仅如此，这些丧心病狂的民族败类，竟而辜负中央和毛主席无微不至的关怀和宽待，公然勾结帝国主义发动武装叛乱，背叛祖国，坚决与人民为敌，企图使西藏脱离祖国大家庭，重新置于帝国主义奴役之下，以保持这个反动集团的罪恶统治，继续骑在西藏人民头上作威作福，这些滔天罪行，已为国法所不容。我们呼和浩特各族人民热烈拥护国务院关于解散西藏地方政府、彻底平息西藏叛乱的命令，一致认为这是维护祖国统一，加强民族团结，促进西藏新生，完全符合西藏各族人民的意愿和根本利益的必要措施。我们愤怒声讨叛国集团的罪恶行为！并向西藏地区的人民解放军和西藏各族人民致以亲切的慰问！我们战无不胜的人民解放军在反帝爱国的西藏人民的积极协助下，已迅速地平定了叛乱。这一事实，充分说明了西藏人民要求摆脱贫困落后的强烈愿望和走民主、社会主义道路的坚决意志。帝国主义和外国反动派在达赖喇嘛被劫持到印度后，竟公然诬蔑我国领袖，干涉我国内政，这是难以容忍的，我对此表示极大的愤慨。正告帝国主义和外国反动派，你们还是清醒一些吧！我国的内政是不允许任何人干涉的，你们的任何阴谋企图必定以可耻的失败而告终。
