The Expansion of West German Militarism
Yao Niangeng

West German militarism, which twice plunged mankind into the vortex of war in the first fifty years of the twentieth century, is now, with the active support of US imperialism, growing its feathers and attempting to stage a comeback, posing an increasingly serious threat to European security and world peace.

As soon as World War II ended, US imperialism was eager to plan how to pave the way for the resurgence of German militarism in all aspects, so that it could serve as a vanguard in US imperialism's preparations for a new world war. The United States provided massive economic aid to West Germany, and lifted restrictions on West Germany's steel, chemical, and other heavy industries closely related to arms production, so that West German monopoly groups could restore their strength as soon as possible. In politics, it released a large number of war criminals and maintained the backbone of Hitler's invading army, etc. In order to thoroughly undermine the Potsdam Agreement and facilitate the implementation of its plan to restore German militarism, the United States and other Western countries carried out a series of conspiracies to split Germany in 1948: first, merging the Western occupation zones; implementing a separate currency reform that economically divided Germany, etc. Finally, in 1949, the Bonn government was established, creating a divided Germany and laying the political foundation for resurrecting German militarism. In 1955, due to the signing of the Paris Agreement under the direction of US imperialism, West Germany joined the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's aggressive bloc. Afterwards, US imperialism further supported West German monopoly capital. By 1958, seventeen monopoly capital groups controlled nearly 80% of West Germany's total share capital. At present, West Germany's industrial production is second only to the United States, and has jumped to second place in the capitalist world. Compared with 1950, West German industrial production increased by 103% in 1957, exceeding the 1936 production level by 125%. The rapid economic development has not only greatly strengthened West Germany's economic competitive position, but also created a powerful prerequisite for its militarist expansion.

In order to eliminate obstacles to militarist expansion, the Bonn government declared the German Communist Party "illegal" in 1956. In less than half a year in 1958, Adenauer arrested 239 people, mainly cadres and members of the German Communist Party, in order to deal with the people's anti-nuclear armament movement. Progressive groups such as the West German Democratic Women's Federation and the German-Soviet Friendship Association were also successively banned from activities. In March 1959, it forcibly dissolved democratic organizations such as the "German Peace Committee" and the "Committee for Mutual Understanding of the German People" on the grounds of "violating the Constitution." The West German Minister of Justice also frantically demanded the restoration of the death penalty for political prisoners. On the other hand, a large number of Nazi elements were appointed. The current Minister of Defense, Strauss, was a "senior" officer in Hitler's army. Currently, six ministers in the West German government held similar positions during Hitler's era. In the judicial field alone, there are approximately 600 former Nazi elements working, including 450 judges from Hitler's "People's Court" and 150 judges from the former "Wehrmacht." These judges, who had previously sentenced thousands of Danish, Polish, and Czechoslovak patriots to death, have not only not been punished as they should be, but are now riding high on the heads of the West German people.

In the diplomatic field, the use of Nazi elements is even more alarming. According to materials recently published by the German Unification Committee of the German Democratic Republic, 80% of the officials in the Bonn Foreign Ministry were diplomats from the Ribbentrop era. Of the seventy-plus Bonn embassies and legations, fifty-one are led by veteran Nazi diplomats. These people were once important organizers of the invasion of European countries. In addition, a large number of militarist groups have also revived like mushrooms after rain. According to the West German "1958 German Soldier Yearbook," there are currently about 1,200 militarist groups operating in West Germany, including 41 groups of the former "SS," with 2.5 million members. All are former Hitler soldiers.

In the military field, the current goal of West German militarists is to complete the establishment of a large number of aggressive troops and carry out nuclear armament. By February of this year, the West German Bundeswehr had reached 185,000 people. Among them, the army had 114,000 people, the navy had 18,500 people, the air force had 40,500 people, and the "civil defense force" had 12,000 people, with about 1,000 various aircraft. The Adenauer group is planning to further expand the army. According to official announcements, by April 1959, the total number of armed forces had reached 200,000, and by 1961 it will reach 350,000, totaling twelve divisions, equivalent to thirty-five divisions in Hitler's era. All of these are directed at the Soviet Union and the Eastern European democratic countries. This army is completely controlled by former Hitler generals, and all of the one hundred-plus army and navy generals served in important positions in Hitler's war of aggression. Forty-five of these generals were generals in Hitler's era (seven generals are war criminals). These executioners, whose hands are stained with the blood of the European people, have now put on brand new military uniforms and are standing in front of maps marking military bombing targets.

In addition to the above three services, West Germany has also established a so-called "homeland force" of 50,000 former Nazi soldiers, which is not under the control of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization but is directly controlled by Strauss.

In addition, West Germany has also established some "regional" military and paramilitary organizations. The "militia defense team" is scheduled to reach 200,000 people by 1962. The "disaster technical rescue team" had reached 50,000 people last year. The "air defense and aerial inspection, notification and liaison team" had reached 400,000 people in 1958. The militarized "Red Cross" already had 800,000 people as early as 1957, which, as the "Frankfurter Rundschau" revealed, is intended to provoke the German Democratic Republic.

Under the guidance of Strauss' military thinking of "quality over quantity," the West German ruling group is stepping up the armament of its aggressive troops with atomic and rocket weapons. On March 25, 1958, the West German Bundestag officially passed a resolution to equip the West German army with atomic weapons. Immediately afterwards, West Germany purchased various missiles from the United States. Training for rocket troops began on a large scale at the beginning of this year. From January 1956 to now, more than 2,000 West German officers and soldiers have successively received training in the use of missile weapons in the United States, and there are still 1,000 people continuing to train in the United States. US officials openly admit that these trained West German officers and soldiers will be responsible for training and developing the West German army to conduct nuclear warfare. On April 1, the first missile battalion was established, consisting of 10,000 people, equipped with US-made "Honest John" type rockets that can be equipped with nuclear warheads.

West Germany recently purchased 300 "Nike" missiles and 36 "Matador" missiles from the United States. The West German Air Force already has more than 170 American F84 fighters that can carry atomic bombs. At the same time, West Germany is also stepping up research and development of nuclear weapons at home and abroad. In early June 1958, the West German Ministry of Defense decided to allocate 1 billion marks for rocket research before 1964; in the 1958-1959 fiscal year alone, 250 million marks were allocated for research into modern science. In order to counter the US and British monopoly on atomic weapons and attempt to circumvent the restrictions of the Paris Agreement, West Germany joined forces with France and Italy in 1958 to form a "triangular arms alliance" to study the manufacture of the latest weapons such as rockets. Currently, the three countries are using Colomb-BÃ©char in Algeria as a launching test site for the three countries' rockets and atomic weapons.

Strauss' recent eighteen-day "visit" to the United States was to accelerate the pace of West German atomic armament. He openly said that every West German army division will be equipped with missiles. He also clamored that missile weapons must be used to equip the West German navy.

In the overall plan of West German militarist ambitionists, dominating Western Europe is the first established step. At present, West Germany is expanding its power within the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's aggressive bloc and using the bloc to carry out military expansion to Western and Northern European countries. As early as 1955, the West German representative stated in a tough tone when first participating in the North Atlantic Group Council that West Germany joined the group not to be at the beck and call of others, but to directly issue orders. Due to its strong economic strength and US support, West Germany has now achieved a pivotal position within the group. It is scheduled to provide twelve divisions of troops to the group. West German officers in various joint commands of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization have reached as many as 142, and all hold important positions. For example, the former Chief of Staff of the Hitler army's headquarters in France, Speidel, is now the Commander-in-Chief of the Central European Ground Forces of the organization, and the command of the Central European Naval Command in the southern North Sea is now controlled by Zenker, an assistant to the former war criminal DÃ¶nitz. However, West Germany is not satisfied with this. It is now plotting to seize military power in the Nordic region under the banner of "European integration." Not long ago, West Germany established a naval base in Denmark within the scope of the so-called Danish-West German Joint Baltic Naval Command, and is now further demanding the establishment of an army base in Denmark and a naval base in Norway under the pretext of "protecting the rear supply lines of the German (i.e., West German) armed forces north of the Elbe River," and proposes that the naval management rights of the Danish and Norwegian regions be handed over to West German revanchist elements. In addition, at the beginning of this year, with the support of the United States, it obtained the right to establish West German air force and naval warehouses in Belgium and France. It is now making the same demands to the Netherlands, Denmark, and Norway. There are reports that General Norstad, the Supreme Commander of the North Atlantic Group Armed Forces, is already considering the issue of increasing West German soldiers in US bases in France and Italy. From this we can see that the ambition of West German militarist elements is by no means limited to pointing the spearhead to the East. It will expand to the weakest link, which is undoubtedly today's Western Europe. Therefore, the people of Western European countries are subject to the most serious threat from West German militarism.

The expansion of West German militarism is not only manifested in the military field, but also in the economic field. On May 3, 1958, the "Neues Deutschland" disclosed a secret letter from West German Economics Minister Erhard to Adenauer, suggesting that West Germany implement economic expansion. The letter emphasized that economic power is political power and military power. This letter fully exposes the intentions of West German militarist elements. This makes it easy for people to understand why West Germany has been so enthusiastic about competition in the international market and capital exports in recent years. In the final analysis, they are all "vanguards" of militarist expansion. As early as 1950 and 1951, West Germany's exports to Western Europe had exceeded those of France and the United Kingdom, respectively, and in 1953 they exceeded those of the United States. Currently, exports to Western Europe account for 60% of its total exports. In recent years, West Germany's private investment in Western Europe has exceeded 733 million marks. Since the establishment of the Common Market, this investment activity has become more active. In the first quarter of this year, West German large companies purchased 31 million marks of stocks abroad, exceeding the total amount of stocks purchased abroad by West German private capital from May 1956 to the end of 1958. Most of the investment is concentrated in the Common Market countries.

It goes without saying that the establishment of the "Common Market" has given the West German ruling group great convenience to control Western Europe. Because in this organization, West German industrial production accounts for nearly half of the total industrial production of the six countries, and it is like the leader of the organization.

However, the West German monopoly capital group is not satisfied with this. In order to ensure West Germany's economic and political hegemony in Western Europe, squeeze out British forces, and improve its bargaining position with the United States, Adenauer also organized the "Bonn-Paris Axis" with de Gaulle, using loans of more than 1 billion marks and supporting France's colonial war in Algeria as bait. The French monopoly capital group, which has long been dissatisfied with the United States and the United Kingdom and has been exhausted by years of colonial war, had no choice but to quench its thirst with poison and rely on borrowing from West Germany to tide over the financial crisis, and fantasize about using the financial resources of West German monopoly capital to "develop" the resources of French-owned Africa. The result, of course, is "inviting a wolf into the house," throwing oneself into a trap, and playing right into the hands of West German revanchist elements.

At present, West German monopoly capital, through the "Common Market" regulations on the joint development of colonies, especially through the "Franco-German Economic Committee" agreement on "cooperative" development of Africa, has extended its claws into the African territories of France, Italy, and Belgium. West German companies are now "partnering" with France to exploit oil and mineral resources in Algeria. West German capital has also begun to enter the uranium mines in the Congo, and West Germany is also trying to get involved in the oil development of the Sahara.

In the eyes of West German militarist elements, who lost all their colonies in World War I, the rich resources and natural wealth of the Asia-Africa region are particularly tempting. In 1957, West German Parliament Speaker Gerstenmaier openly said: "The changes in Africa in the next twenty years are not only related to... the current colonial countries, but also, without a doubt, will be related to the Germans." This is the West German official confession of its ambitions for Africa. In October 1958, Erhard traveled to eight countries in Asia and Africa to pave the way for West German capital exports. From 1952 to September 1958, West Germany invested a total of 108 million marks in Africa, 89 million marks in Asia, and 173 million marks in South America. In addition, in the past two years, West Germany has also provided loans to many Asian, African, and South American countries for the purchase of West German goods, mainly: Argentina 277 million marks, India 660 million marks, Turkey 210 million marks, and the United Arab Republic 400 million marks. This also marks a new stage in the outward expansion of West German imperialism, because it has re-entered its traditional markets (such as Turkey and South America) and entered new markets (such as India and the United Arab Republic).

It is worth noting that West German militarism is beginning to use its economic expansion to carry out political infiltration. Recently, West Germany has funded France's dirty colonial war in Algeria and helped Turkey formulate anti-communist regulations. West German imperialist elements are already actively participating in the evil activities of the imperialist joint suppression of national independence movements.

The West German ruling group's foreign policy serves the above-mentioned imperialist and militarist purposes. Therefore, they adhere to the notorious rigid policy, oppose the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany, oppose the liberalization of West Berlin, oppose the restriction of armaments in Central Europe, oppose East-West negotiations, in a word, they oppose all measures that are conducive to easing the situation. They fear the easing of the situation like a mouse fears a cat. But these gentlemen only care about burying their heads in their own wishful thinking, and have not opened their eyes to see the world today. Today is no longer the era when Hitler launched the war, but the era when the East wind prevails over the West wind. First of all, a strong fortress of peace headed by the Soviet Union stands tall in the East, and its strength has greatly exceeded that of the Western imperialist camp. Any rash invasion will be met with a double blow; second, a peaceful and democratic and powerful German Democratic Republic stands tall on German territory, shining like a bright lighthouse, illuminating the road ahead for the German people; finally, the European people have vivid memories of the disasters imposed on them by the Hitler bandits, and the four million disabled people and families of the deceased in West Germany will never forget that historical lesson. Last year's anti-nuclear armed movement of five million people and this year's large-scale demonstration of 600,000 people in Dortmund are the best warnings to West German atomic maniacs. Adenauer's aggressive policy has served as a negative teacher for the people for more than ten years. Therefore, peace-loving people should have sufficient estimates and be very vigilant about the danger of West German militarism; but on the other hand, it should also be pointed out that it is not terrible. As long as it dares to launch a war, it will inevitably suffer the same fate as Hitler under the counterattack of the powerful peace-loving people. (Attached picture)
