The Expansion of West German Militarism
Yao Niangeng

West German militarism, which twice plunged mankind into the vortex of war in the first fifty years of the twentieth century, is now, with the active support of US imperialism, growing its feathers and attempting to stage a comeback, posing an increasingly serious threat to European security and world peace.

As soon as World War II ended, US imperialism was eager to plan how to pave the way for the resurgence of German militarism in all aspects, so that it could serve as a vanguard in US imperialism's preparations for a new world war. The United States provided massive economic aid to West Germany, and lifted restrictions on West Germany's steel, chemical, and other heavy industries closely related to arms production, so that West German monopoly groups could restore their strength as soon as possible. In politics, it released a large number of war criminals and maintained the backbone of Hitler's invading army, etc. In order to thoroughly undermine the Potsdam Agreement and facilitate the implementation of its plan to restore German militarism, the United States and other Western countries carried out a series of conspiracies to split Germany in 1948: first, merging the Western occupation zones; implementing a separate currency reform that economically divided Germany, etc. Finally, in 1949, the Bonn government was established, creating a divided Germany and laying the political foundation for resurrecting German militarism. In 1955, due to the signing of the Paris Agreement under the direction of US imperialism, West Germany joined the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's aggressive bloc. Afterwards, US imperialism further supported West German monopoly capital. By 1958, seventeen monopoly capital groups controlled nearly 80% of West Germany's total share capital. At present, West Germany's industrial production is second only to the United States, and has jumped to second place in the capitalist world. Compared with 1950, West German industrial production increased by 103% in 1957, exceeding the 1936 production level by 125%. The rapid economic development has not only greatly strengthened West Germany's economic competitive position, but also created a powerful prerequisite for its militarist expansion.

In order to eliminate obstacles to militarist expansion, the Bonn government declared the German Communist Party "illegal" in 1956. In less than half a year in 1958, Adenauer arrested 239 people, mainly cadres and members of the German Communist Party, in order to deal with the people's anti-nuclear armament movement. Progressive groups such as the West German Democratic Women's Federation and the German-Soviet Friendship Association were also successively banned from activities. In March 1959, it forcibly dissolved democratic organizations such as the "German Peace Committee" and the "Committee for Mutual Understanding of the German People" on the grounds of "violating the Constitution." The West German Minister of Justice also frantically demanded the restoration of the death penalty for political prisoners. On the other hand, a large number of Nazi elements were appointed. The current Minister of Defense, Strauss, was a "senior" officer in Hitler's army. Currently, six ministers in the West German government held similar positions during Hitler's era. In the judicial field alone, there are approximately 600 former Nazi elements working, including 450 judges from Hitler's "People's Court" and 150 judges from the former "Wehrmacht." These judges, who had previously sentenced thousands of Danish, Polish, and Czechoslovak patriots to death, have not only not been punished as they should be, but are now riding high on the heads of the West German people.

In the diplomatic field, the use of Nazi elements is even more alarming. According to materials recently published by the German Unification Committee of the German Democratic Republic, 80% of the officials in the Bonn Foreign Ministry were diplomats from the Ribbentrop era. Of the seventy-plus Bonn embassies and legations, fifty-one are led by veteran Nazi diplomats. These people were once important organizers of the invasion of European countries. In addition, a large number of militarist groups have also revived like mushrooms after rain. According to the West German "1958 German Soldier Yearbook," there are currently about 1,200 militarist groups operating in West Germany, including 41 groups of the former "SS," with 2.5 million members. All are former Hitler soldiers.

In the military field, the current goal of West German militarists is to complete the establishment of a large number of aggressive troops and carry out nuclear armament. By February of this year, the West German Bundeswehr had reached 185,000 people. Among them, the army had 114,000 people, the navy had 18,500 people, the air force had 40,500 people, and the "civil defense force" had 12,000 people, with about 1,000 various aircraft. The Adenauer group is planning to further expand the army. According to official announcements, by April 1959, the total number of armed forces had reached 200,000, and by 1961 it will reach 350,000, totaling twelve divisions, equivalent to thirty-five divisions in Hitler's era. All of these are directed at the Soviet Union and the Eastern European democratic countries. This army is completely controlled by former Hitler generals, and all of the one hundred-plus army and navy generals served in important positions in Hitler's war of aggression. Forty-five of these generals were generals in Hitler's era (seven generals are war criminals). These executioners, whose hands are stained with the blood of the European people, have now put on brand new military uniforms and are standing in front of maps marking military bombing targets.

In addition to the above three services, West Germany has also established a so-called "homeland force" of 50,000 former Nazi soldiers, which is not under the control of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization but is directly controlled by Strauss.

In addition, West Germany has also established some "regional" military and paramilitary organizations. The "militia defense team" is scheduled to reach 200,000 people by 1962. The "disaster technical rescue team" had reached 50,000 people last year. The "air defense and aerial inspection, notification and liaison team" had reached 400,000 people in 1958. The militarized "Red Cross" already had 800,000 people as early as 1957, which, as the "Frankfurter Rundschau" revealed, is intended to provoke the German Democratic Republic.

Under the guidance of Strauss' military thinking of "quality over quantity," the West German ruling group is stepping up the armament of its aggressive troops with atomic and rocket weapons. On March 25, 1958, the West German Bundestag officially passed a resolution to equip the West German army with atomic weapons. Immediately afterwards, West Germany purchased various missiles from the United States. Training for rocket troops began on a large scale at the beginning of this year. From January 1956 to now, more than 2,000 West German officers and soldiers have successively received training in the use of missile weapons in the United States, and there are still 1,000 people continuing to train in the United States. US officials openly admit that these trained West German officers and soldiers will be responsible for training and developing the West German army to conduct nuclear warfare. On April 1, the first missile battalion was established, consisting of 10,000 people, equipped with US-made "Honest John" type rockets that can be equipped with nuclear warheads.

West Germany recently purchased 300 "Nike" missiles and 36 "Matador" missiles from the United States. The West German Air Force already has more than 170 American F84 fighters that can carry atomic bombs. At the same time, West Germany is also stepping up research and development of nuclear weapons at home and abroad. In early June 1958, the West German Ministry of Defense decided to allocate 1 billion marks for rocket research before 1964; in the 1958-1959 fiscal year alone, 250 million marks were allocated for research into modern science. In order to counter the US and British monopoly on atomic weapons and attempt to circumvent the restrictions of the Paris Agreement, West Germany joined forces with France and Italy in 1958 to form a "triangular arms alliance" to study the manufacture of the latest weapons such as rockets. Currently, the three countries are using Colomb-Béchar in Algeria as a launching test site for the three countries' rockets and atomic weapons.

Strauss' recent eighteen-day "visit" to the United States was to accelerate the pace of West German atomic armament. He openly said that every West German army division will be equipped with missiles. He also clamored that missile weapons must be used to equip the West German navy.

In the overall plan of West German militarist ambitionists, dominating Western Europe is the first established step. At present, West Germany is expanding its power within the North Atlantic Treaty Organization's aggressive bloc and using the bloc to carry out military expansion to Western and Northern European countries. As early as 1955, the West German representative stated in a tough tone when first participating in the North Atlantic Group Council that West Germany joined the group not to be at the beck and call of others, but to directly issue orders. Due to its strong economic strength and US support, West Germany has now achieved a pivotal position within the group. It is scheduled to provide twelve divisions of troops to the group. West German officers in various joint commands of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization have reached as many as 142, and all hold important positions. For example, the former Chief of Staff of the Hitler army's headquarters in France, Speidel, is now the Commander-in-Chief of the Central European Ground Forces of the organization, and the command of the Central European Naval Command in the southern North Sea is now controlled by Zenker, an assistant to the former war criminal Dönitz. However, West Germany is not satisfied with this. It is now plotting to seize military power in the Nordic region under the banner of "European integration." Not long ago, West Germany established a naval base in Denmark within the scope of the so-called Danish-West German Joint Baltic Naval Command, and is now further demanding the establishment of an army base in Denmark and a naval base in Norway under the pretext of "protecting the rear supply lines of the German (i.e., West German) armed forces north of the Elbe River," and proposes that the naval management rights of the Danish and Norwegian regions be handed over to West German revanchist elements. In addition, at the beginning of this year, with the support of the United States, it obtained the right to establish West German air force and naval warehouses in Belgium and France. It is now making the same demands to the Netherlands, Denmark, and Norway. There are reports that General Norstad, the Supreme Commander of the North Atlantic Group Armed Forces, is already considering the issue of increasing West German soldiers in US bases in France and Italy. From this we can see that the ambition of West German militarist elements is by no means limited to pointing the spearhead to the East. It will expand to the weakest link, which is undoubtedly today's Western Europe. Therefore, the people of Western European countries are subject to the most serious threat from West German militarism.

The expansion of West German militarism is not only manifested in the military field, but also in the economic field. On May 3, 1958, the "Neues Deutschland" disclosed a secret letter from West German Economics Minister Erhard to Adenauer, suggesting that West Germany implement economic expansion. The letter emphasized that economic power is political power and military power. This letter fully exposes the intentions of West German militarist elements. This makes it easy for people to understand why West Germany has been so enthusiastic about competition in the international market and capital exports in recent years. In the final analysis, they are all "vanguards" of militarist expansion. As early as 1950 and 1951, West Germany's exports to Western Europe had exceeded those of France and the United Kingdom, respectively, and in 1953 they exceeded those of the United States. Currently, exports to Western Europe account for 60% of its total exports. In recent years, West Germany's private investment in Western Europe has exceeded 733 million marks. Since the establishment of the Common Market, this investment activity has become more active. In the first quarter of this year, West German large companies purchased 31 million marks of stocks abroad, exceeding the total amount of stocks purchased abroad by West German private capital from May 1956 to the end of 1958. Most of the investment is concentrated in the Common Market countries.

It goes without saying that the establishment of the "Common Market" has given the West German ruling group great convenience to control Western Europe. Because in this organization, West German industrial production accounts for nearly half of the total industrial production of the six countries, and it is like the leader of the organization.

However, the West German monopoly capital group is not satisfied with this. In order to ensure West Germany's economic and political hegemony in Western Europe, squeeze out British forces, and improve its bargaining position with the United States, Adenauer also organized the "Bonn-Paris Axis" with de Gaulle, using loans of more than 1 billion marks and supporting France's colonial war in Algeria as bait. The French monopoly capital group, which has long been dissatisfied with the United States and the United Kingdom and has been exhausted by years of colonial war, had no choice but to quench its thirst with poison and rely on borrowing from West Germany to tide over the financial crisis, and fantasize about using the financial resources of West German monopoly capital to "develop" the resources of French-owned Africa. The result, of course, is "inviting a wolf into the house," throwing oneself into a trap, and playing right into the hands of West German revanchist elements.

At present, West German monopoly capital, through the "Common Market" regulations on the joint development of colonies, especially through the "Franco-German Economic Committee" agreement on "cooperative" development of Africa, has extended its claws into the African territories of France, Italy, and Belgium. West German companies are now "partnering" with France to exploit oil and mineral resources in Algeria. West German capital has also begun to enter the uranium mines in the Congo, and West Germany is also trying to get involved in the oil development of the Sahara.

In the eyes of West German militarist elements, who lost all their colonies in World War I, the rich resources and natural wealth of the Asia-Africa region are particularly tempting. In 1957, West German Parliament Speaker Gerstenmaier openly said: "The changes in Africa in the next twenty years are not only related to... the current colonial countries, but also, without a doubt, will be related to the Germans." This is the West German official confession of its ambitions for Africa. In October 1958, Erhard traveled to eight countries in Asia and Africa to pave the way for West German capital exports. From 1952 to September 1958, West Germany invested a total of 108 million marks in Africa, 89 million marks in Asia, and 173 million marks in South America. In addition, in the past two years, West Germany has also provided loans to many Asian, African, and South American countries for the purchase of West German goods, mainly: Argentina 277 million marks, India 660 million marks, Turkey 210 million marks, and the United Arab Republic 400 million marks. This also marks a new stage in the outward expansion of West German imperialism, because it has re-entered its traditional markets (such as Turkey and South America) and entered new markets (such as India and the United Arab Republic).

It is worth noting that West German militarism is beginning to use its economic expansion to carry out political infiltration. Recently, West Germany has funded France's dirty colonial war in Algeria and helped Turkey formulate anti-communist regulations. West German imperialist elements are already actively participating in the evil activities of the imperialist joint suppression of national independence movements.

The West German ruling group's foreign policy serves the above-mentioned imperialist and militarist purposes. Therefore, they adhere to the notorious rigid policy, oppose the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany, oppose the liberalization of West Berlin, oppose the restriction of armaments in Central Europe, oppose East-West negotiations, in a word, they oppose all measures that are conducive to easing the situation. They fear the easing of the situation like a mouse fears a cat. But these gentlemen only care about burying their heads in their own wishful thinking, and have not opened their eyes to see the world today. Today is no longer the era when Hitler launched the war, but the era when the East wind prevails over the West wind. First of all, a strong fortress of peace headed by the Soviet Union stands tall in the East, and its strength has greatly exceeded that of the Western imperialist camp. Any rash invasion will be met with a double blow; second, a peaceful and democratic and powerful German Democratic Republic stands tall on German territory, shining like a bright lighthouse, illuminating the road ahead for the German people; finally, the European people have vivid memories of the disasters imposed on them by the Hitler bandits, and the four million disabled people and families of the deceased in West Germany will never forget that historical lesson. Last year's anti-nuclear armed movement of five million people and this year's large-scale demonstration of 600,000 people in Dortmund are the best warnings to West German atomic maniacs. Adenauer's aggressive policy has served as a negative teacher for the people for more than ten years. Therefore, peace-loving people should have sufficient estimates and be very vigilant about the danger of West German militarism; but on the other hand, it should also be pointed out that it is not terrible. As long as it dares to launch a war, it will inevitably suffer the same fate as Hitler under the counterattack of the powerful peace-loving people. (Attached picture)

    西德军国主义的扩张
    姚念赓
    在二十世纪的头五十年中，曾经两度把人类推入战争漩涡的德国军国主义，在美帝国主义的积极扶植下，现正羽毛渐丰，企图东山再起，日益严重地威胁着欧洲安全和世界和平。
    第二次世界大战刚一结束，美帝国主义就迫不及待地筹划如何从各方面为德国军国主义的再起开辟道路，以便使它日后能在美帝国主义准备新世界大战的活动中充当急先锋。美国从经济上大量援助西德，取消对西德钢铁、化学等跟军火生产有密切关系的重工业的限制，以便使西德垄断集团尽速恢复力量。在政治上又大量释放战犯，保持希特勒侵略军队的骨干等等。为了彻底破坏波茨坦协定，便于实现恢复德国军国主义的计划，1948年美国和其他西方国家进行了一系列分裂德国的阴谋活动：首先合并西方占领区；实行经济上分裂德国的单独的币制改革等等，最后在1949年更建立起了波恩政府，造成了德国的分裂局面，为德国军国主义招魂打下了政治基础。1955年，由于在美帝国主义导演之下签订了巴黎协定，西德参加了北大西洋公约侵略集团。以后，美帝国主义进一步扶植西德垄断资本，到1958年为止，十七个垄断资本集团差不多掌握了西德全部股份资本的80％。目前西德的工业生产仅次于美国，而跃居资本主义世界的第二位。与1950年相比，1957年西德工业生产增加了103％，已经超过了1936年生产水平的125％。经济上的迅速发展不仅大大加强了西德经济竞争的地位，并为其军国主义的扩张创造了有力的前提。
    为排除军国主义扩张的障碍，波恩政府于1956年宣布德共“非法”。1958年中不到半年时间内，为了对付人民反原子武装运动，阿登纳逮捕了二百三十九人，其中主要是德共干部和党员，西德民主妇联和德苏友协等进步团体亦相继被禁止活动。1959年3月又以“违反宪法”为名，强行解散了“德国和平委员会”和“争取德国人民互相了解委员会”等民主组织。西德司法部长还疯狂地要求对政治犯恢复死刑。另一方面，则大量起用纳粹分子，现任国防部长施特劳斯就是希特勒军队的“高级”军官。目前西德政府中的六个部长在希特勒时代都担任过类似职务。单就司法界来说，就有大约六百名前纳粹分子在工作，其中有希特勒“人民法院”的四百五十名法官和前“国防军”的一百五十名法官。这些法官过去曾经把成千上万的丹麦、波兰、捷克斯洛伐克的爱国者判处死刑，他们不仅未受到应有的惩治，而现在又高高地骑在西德人民的头上了。
    在外交方面，起用纳粹分子的情况更是十分惊人。根据民主德国的德国统一委员会最近发表的材料，在波恩外交部中，80％的官员都是里宾特洛普时代的外交人员。在七十多个波恩大使馆和公使馆中，有五十一个是由老牌纳粹外交人员领导。这些人都曾是侵略欧洲国家的重要组织者。另外，大量的军国主义团体也像雨后春笋般地复活起来。据西德“1958年德国军人年鉴”材料，目前在西德活动的军国主义团体有一千二百个左右，包括前“党卫军”的四十一个团体在内的所属二百五十万会员。都是前希特勒军人。
    在军事方面，西德军国主义分子当前的目标是：完成建立大量侵略军和进行核武装。到今年2月，西德国防军已达十八万五千人。其中陆军十一万四千人，海军一万八千五百人，空军四万零五百人，“民防军”一万二千名，拥有各种飞机约一千多架。阿登纳集团正在策划进一步扩军，据官方公布，到1959年4月，武装部队的总人数已达二十万人，到1961年将达三十五万人，共十二个师，等于希特勒时代的三十五个师。所有这些都是指向苏联和东欧民主国家。这支军队完全由前希特勒将领控制，全部一百多名陆海军将领都曾在希特勒侵略战争中担任过重要职位，其中四十五名将领是希特勒时代的上将（有七个将领是战犯）。这些双手染满了欧洲人民鲜血的刽子手们现在又重新换上了崭新的军服，站在地图前标画着军事轰炸目标了。
    除了上述三军外，西德还建立了一支不归北大西洋公约组织而由施特劳斯直接控制的，由五万名前纳粹军人组成的所谓“本土部队”。
    此外，西德还成立了一些“区域性”的军事组织和半军事组织。“民兵防御队”，预定到1962年达到二十万人。“灾难技术救护队”去年已达五万人。“防空和空中视察、通知和联络队”在1958年已达四十万人。军事化的
  “红十字会”早在1957年就已经有八十万人，正像“法兰克福评论报”所透露的，在于向民主德国进行挑衅。
    在施特劳斯所提出的“质胜于量”这一军事思想指导下，西德统治集团正在加紧以原子和火箭武器武装其侵略军队。1958年3月25日西德联邦议院正式通过了以原子武器装备西德军队的决议。紧接着西德便向美国购买各种导弹。火箭部队的训练已于今年初大规模展开。从1956年1月到现在，已经有二千多名西德官兵先后在美受完使用导弹武器的训练，目前仍有一千名在美国继续受训，美国官方人士公开承认，这些受过训练的西德官兵将负责训练和发挥西德军队进行核战争。4月1日成立了第一个导弹营，由一万人组成，配有美国制的可以装核弹头的“诚实的约翰”型的火箭。
    西德最近并向美国购买了三百个“奈克”式导弹和三十六个“斗牛士”式导弹。西德空军已经拥有一百七十多架可以携带原子弹的美国F84型战斗机。与此同时，西德还在国内外加紧进行核武器的研究与发展。1958年6月初，西德国防部决定在1964年以前拨款十亿马克从事火箭研究；仅在1958—1959财政年度，就拨出二亿五千万马克进行现代化科学的研究。为对抗美英对原子武器的垄断，并企图绕过巴黎协定对它的束缚，西德于1958年联合法国和意大利成立了“军备三角同盟”，研究火箭等最新式武器的制造。目前三国正利用阿尔及利亚的科隆培沙作为三国火箭和原子武器发射试验场。
    施特劳斯最近去美国所作的十八天的“访问”，就是为了加快西德原子武装的步调。他公开说，西德每一个陆军师都将配备导弹。他还叫嚣说，必须用导弹武器来装备西德海军。
    在西德军国主义野心家的全盘计划中，称霸西欧是第一个既定的步骤。目前西德正在扩充它在北大西洋公约侵略集团内的势力和利用该集团向西欧和北欧国家进行军事扩张。早在1955年，西德代表在第一次参加北大西洋集团理事会时就曾以强硬口吻表明，西德参加该集团不是为了听命于人，而是为了直接发号施令。由于它的经济实力的雄厚和美国的支持，西德现已在该集团内取得了举足轻重的地位。它向该集团提供的兵力定为十二个师。北大西洋公约组织各联合司令部的西德军官已达一百四十二名之多，并都担任重要职位，如前希特勒军队驻法国总部的总参谋长斯派达尔现任该组织的中欧地面部队总司令，中欧海军司令部北海南部的指挥大权现则由前战犯邓尼兹的助手曾克掌握。但是西德并不以此为满足，它现在正打着“欧洲整体化”的旗帜，阴谋夺取北欧地区的军权。不久以前，西德已在所谓丹麦—西德波罗的海联合海军司令部的范围内在丹麦建立了海军基地，现又进一步以“保护易北河以北的德国（即西德）武装部队的后方供应线”为借口要求在丹麦再设立陆军基地和在挪威设立海军基地，并提出把丹麦、挪威地区的海军管理权交给西德的复仇主义分子掌握。此外，今年初，在美国的支持下，并取得了在比利时、法国境内建立西德空军和海军的仓库的权利。现正在向荷兰、丹麦、挪威提出同样要求。有消息说，北大西洋集团武装部队最高司令诺斯塔德将军已经在考虑关于在法、意的美国基地增加西德士兵问题。由此我们可以看到西德军国主义分子的野心绝不仅限于把矛头指向东方，它将向最弱的一环扩张，这一环无疑的就是今天的西欧，因此西欧国家的人民受到了西德军国主义最严重的威胁。
    西德军国主义的扩张不仅仅表现在军事上，同样也表现在经济上。1958年5月3日“新德意志报”披露了西德经济部长艾哈德给阿登纳的一封密信，建议西德实行经济扩张，信中着重提到，经济力量就是政治力量和军事力量。这封信充分暴露了西德军国主义分子的打算，这就使人们不难了解，为什么西德近年来那样热中于国际市场上的竞争和资本输出等等经济活动，归根到底，它们都是军国主义扩张的“先行军”。早在1950年和1951年，西德对西欧的出口额已分别超过法国和英国，1953年又超过了美国。目前对西欧的出口占其总出口的60％。近几年来西德对西欧的私人投资已超过七亿三千三百万马克。共同市场成立后，这种投资活动更趋积极。今年第一季西德大公司在国外购买的股票达三千一百万马克，超过了从1956年5月到1958年底西德私人资本在国外购买股票的总额。投资的大部分正是集中在共同市场各国。
    “共同市场”的成立给了西德统治集团控制西欧的极大方便，这是不言而喻的。因为在该组织中，西德工业生产占六国工业生产总额将近一半，俨然是该组织的盟主。
    但是西德垄断资本集团并不以此为满足。为了确保西德在西欧经济和政治上的霸权，排挤英国势力，并提高对美国讨价还价的地位，阿登纳还用超过十亿马克的贷款和支持法国在阿尔及利亚的殖民战争为诱饵，同戴高乐组织了“波恩—巴黎轴心”。而对美、英早已心怀不满，又被连年殖民战争拖得精疲力尽的法国垄断资本集团为求自保，也只好饮鸩止渴依靠向西德借债来度过财政危机，并幻想借助西德垄断资本的财力来“开发”法属非洲的富源。其结果当然是“引狼入室”，自投罗网，正中西德复仇主义分子的下怀。
    目前，西德垄断资本通过“共同市场”关于共同开发殖民地的规定，特别是通过“法—德经济委员会”关于“合作”开发非洲的协议，已将它的魔爪伸入法、意、比的非洲属地。西德公司现在已同法国“合伙”开采阿尔及利亚的石油和矿藏，刚果的铀矿现也开始有了西德的资本，西德还在设法插足撒哈拉的石油开发。
    在第一次大战失掉了全部殖民地的西德军国主义分子眼中，亚非地区的丰富资源和自然财富是特别有诱惑力的。1957年西德议会主席格斯登梅尔公开说：“在今后二十年中非洲的变化不仅与……目前的殖民国家有关，并且，毫无疑问也将与德国人有关”。这就是西德官方对非洲野心的供状。1958年10月，艾哈德到亚非八个国家作了旅行，为西德的资本输出开辟道路。从1952到1958年9月，西德向非洲投资共一亿零八百万马克，向亚洲投资共八千九百万马克，向南美投资一亿七千三百万马克。此外过去两年中，西德并向许多亚非和南美国家贷款，作为购买西德商品之用，其中主要为：阿根廷二点七七亿马克，印度六点六亿马克，土耳其二点一亿马克，阿联四亿马克。这也标志着西德帝国主义向外扩张的一个新阶段，因为它重新侵入了昔日的传统市场（如土耳其、南美），并打进了新市场（如印度、阿联）。
    值得注意的是，西德军国主义正在开始借它的经济扩张进行政治渗入。最近西德出资帮助法国进行肮脏的阿尔及利亚殖民战争，并帮助土耳其制定反共条例。西德的帝国主义分子已经在积极参与帝国主义联合镇压民族独立运动的罪恶活动。
    西德统治集团的外交政策就是为上述帝国主义和军国主义目的服务的，因此他们坚持臭名远扬的僵硬政策，反对在缔结对德和约，反对西柏林的自由化，反对在中欧限制军备，反对东西方谈判，一句话，他们反对一切有助于缓和局势的措施。他们惧怕局势缓和就像老鼠怕猫一样。但是这些先生们只顾一心一意埋头打自己的如意算盘，而没有睁大眼来看一看今天的天下。今天已经不是希特勒发动战争的那个时代，而是东风压倒西风的时代，首先在东方耸立着一个以苏联为首的强大的和平堡垒，它的力量已经大大超过了西方帝国主义阵营，任何轻率的进犯都会遭到双倍的打击；其次在德国的领土上屹立着和平民主的强大的德意志民主共和国，它像一座明亮的灯塔，照耀着德国人民前近的道路；最后，欧洲人民对于希特勒匪徒强加给他们的灾难记忆犹新，西德四百万的残废和死难家属永远不会忘记那次历史教训，去年五百万人参加的反原子武装运动和今年多特蒙德举行的六十万人的大规模示威游行就是对西德原子狂人最好的警告。阿登纳的侵略政策十多年来充当了人民的反面教员。因此，爱好和平的人民，对西德的军国主义的危险，应有足够估计，十分警惕；但另一方面，也应指出，它并不可怕，只要它敢于发动战争，在强大的爱好和平的人民反击之下，它必然要遭到希特勒同样的下场。（附图片）
