Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, May 10th. A group of Indian parliamentarians attended a meeting convened yesterday evening by the so-called "Delhi Tibetan Affairs Committee." According to reports in the local newspapers, this meeting discussed the Tibet issue, which is entirely China's internal affair, and also touched upon the question of "whether the Dalai Lama should return to Tibet under the current circumstances."

These parliamentarians demanded that the Indian government adopt a "firm attitude" towards China on the issue of Tibetan "autonomy" and that the Indian government express its sympathy for the Tibetan people in "concrete terms."

According to today's "Hindustan Standard" and "The Times of India," independent parliamentarian Barucha demanded at the meeting that the Indian government allocate ten million rupees for relief work for Tibetan "refugees" in India. He clamored, "There will be no Sino-Indian friendship until the Chinese authorities restore Tibet's autonomy."

Barucha made no secret of his advocacy for interfering in China's internal affairs on the Tibet issue. He said that because India had relinquished its extraterritorial rights in Tibet based on the explicit guarantee by the Chinese government that Tibetan autonomy would be respected, India therefore had the right to be concerned about Tibetan affairs. He further stated that if the Dalai Lama, of his own free will, wanted to return to Lhasa, the Indian government should hold negotiations with the Chinese government.

Barucha also said, "India's security overrides all considerations, although we all agree on maintaining Sino-Indian friendship."

Independent parliamentarian Khadilkar also said at the meeting, "We hope to be friendly with China, but we will not abandon our basic position on the Tibet issue."

People's Socialist Party parliamentarian Rohit Dave advocated that the Dalai Lama should not be "urged" to leave India. He said that as long as the Dalai Lama wished, he should be allowed to stay in Mussoorie.

He also said that the Indian government should give the Dalai Lama "reasonable opportunities" to draw the world's attention to the Tibet issue.

Abhayavardhana said that the biggest "tragedy" regarding the Tibet issue is that it is being considered as an issue of Sino-Indian relations rather than as a Tibetan issue.

Abhayavardhana absurdly believed that the solution to the Tibet issue is to find a way to reconcile the independence of small countries with their need for economic development. Abhayavardhana slandered China, saying that although China claims to be a socialist country, its behavior in Tibet is an act of narrow nationalism.

### 所谓“德里西藏事务委员会”讨论西藏问题  印一批议员叫嚷干涉我国内政

    所谓“德里西藏事务委员会”讨论西藏问题
    印一批议员叫嚷干涉我国内政
    新华社新德里10日电　印度一批议员昨天晚上参加了所谓“德里西藏事务委员会”召开的一次会议。据这里的报纸报道，这个会议曾经讨论了完全属于中国内政的西藏事件，还谈到“在目前情况下达赖喇嘛是否应当返回西藏”的问题。
    这些议员要求印度政府在西藏“自治”的问题上对中国采取“坚定的态度”，并且要求印度政府以“具体的形式”来表示它对西藏人民的同情。
    据今天的“印度斯坦旗报”和“印度时报”报道，无党派议员巴鲁查在这个会上要求印度政府拨出一千万卢比以便为在印度的西藏“难民”进行善后工作。他叫嚷说，“在中国当局恢复西藏的自治之前，将不会有任何印中友谊。”
    巴鲁查毫不掩饰他主张在西藏问题上干涉中国内政的态度。他说，由于印度是根据中国政府所提出的西藏自治将受到尊重这一明确保证而放弃它在西藏的治外法权的，因此印度有权关心西藏事务。他还进一步说，如果达赖喇嘛出于他的自由意志而要返回拉萨的话，印度政府应当同中国政府举行谈判。
    巴鲁查还说，“印度的安全压倒一切考虑，虽然我们大家都一致同意要维护印中友谊。”
    无党派议员卡迪尔卡在会上也说，“我们希望同中国友好，但是我们将不放弃我们在西藏问题上的基本立场。”
    人民社会党议员罗希特·达维则主张，不应当“催促”达赖喇嘛离开印度。他说，只要达赖喇嘛愿意，就应当允许他留在穆索里。
    他还说，印度政府应当给达赖喇嘛“合理的机会”，以便引起全世界对西藏问题的注意。
    阿布哈亚伐尔达纳说，关于西藏问题的最大“悲剧”是，它不是作为西藏问题而是作为印中关系问题来考虑的。
    阿布哈亚伐尔达纳居然荒谬地认为，对西藏问题的办法是找出一条能够使各小国的独立同它们对经济发展的需要调和起来的道路。阿布哈亚伐尔达纳污蔑中国说，中国虽然自称是一个社会主义国家，但是它在西藏的行为是一种狭隘的民族主义行为。
