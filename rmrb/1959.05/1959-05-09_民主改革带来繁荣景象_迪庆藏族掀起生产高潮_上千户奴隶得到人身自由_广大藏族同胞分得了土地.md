Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, May 8th (By our reporter Zhang Tinggan): The Diqing Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture in Yunnan Province, which implemented democratic reforms last year, is experiencing unprecedented prosperity. The liberated Tibetan farmers, under the leadership of the Communist Party, are shaking off poverty and backwardness and launching a production upsurge of the largest scale in history.

This spring plowing season, on the roads of the autonomous prefecture's villages, rows of rubber-wheeled carts, oxcarts, and herds of yaks and pack animals shuttle back and forth, transporting fertilizer to the highland barley fields. The prefecture plans to plant 53,000 mu of highland barley this year, and more than 40,000 mu have already been sown; more than half of the 60,000 mu of rice paddies have also been seeded. This year, the autonomous prefecture is also planting 7,000 mu of cotton for the first time. In the past, the 240,000 mu of cultivated land in the prefecture was only plowed to a depth of two or three inches, but this year it has all been turned over to a depth of six inches to one foot or more; in the past, 60% of the land here was not fertilized, but this year an average of 20,000 to 40,000 jin of fertilizer is applied per mu. All of the prefecture's 130-plus water conservancy projects have been completed, and together with the water conservancy projects built last year, the irrigated area has reached nearly 200,000 mu. There have also been tremendous improvements in production tools and transportation equipment. The "two-ox lift" old wooden plow, which only slave owners used to have, is now considered a backward agricultural tool. From the beginning of spring plowing to the present, the attendance rate of the labor force throughout the prefecture has consistently remained above 90%.

These thriving new scenes in the Diqing Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture were unprecedented before the implementation of democratic reforms. In the past, during the most suitable time for spring plowing and sowing, the grasslands were still desolate. Although it was already time for farming, they still had to wait for the rulers to choose an "auspicious day" and first perform unpaid labor for landlords, headmen, and slave owners before they could cultivate their own land. The agricultural tools used by the farmers were also very backward, and more than 60% of the crops were not fertilized or weeded. Therefore, until two or three years ago, the average yield of grain crops in the prefecture was only a little over 100 jin per mu. Through the leadership and strong support of the Party and the government, the average yield per mu reached more than 250 jin on the eve of the implementation of democratic reforms. However, because the social system had not been reformed, the grain was often taken away by landlords, headmen, or "Suka" (local officials) as soon as it was harvested. More than 70% of the farmers did not even have enough food for three months and had to rely on large-scale government relief to survive.

In early 1958, at the urgent request of the Tibetan compatriots, the autonomous prefecture implemented democratic reforms, and thousands of slave households gained personal freedom and were distributed land. During the democratic reforms, the first group of communist fighters emerged from the Tibetan masses - more than 300 Communist Party members, and under their leadership, the masses have formed thirty-eight advanced cooperatives and two elementary cooperatives. People's communes have been established in some places. The liberated Tibetan masses launched a production upsurge last year, building more than 100 water conservancy projects. For the first time, their vocabulary included words like "drought resistance" and "water conservancy," which signify the struggle against nature. In 1958, the prefecture's grain production increased by 35%, reaching an average of more than 760 jin per person. Furthermore, because of the democratic reforms, they were no longer exploited by the headmen, and they basically had enough food for the whole year. At the same time, it laid a good foundation for launching a larger production upsurge this year. Now, the Tibetan people are working hard with full confidence to achieve this year's production targets.

　　民主改革带来繁荣景象  迪庆藏族掀起生产高潮
    上千户奴隶得到人身自由  广大藏族同胞分得了土地
    新华社昆明8日电　本社记者张廷干报道：去年实行了民主改革的云南省迪庆藏族自治州，出现了前所未有的繁荣景象。解放了的广大藏族农民正在共产党的领导下摆脱贫困和落后，掀起了一次历史上规模最大的生产高潮。
    今年春耕一开始，自治州各农村的大道上，一排排胶轮马车、牛车和一群群牦牛、驮马来往如梭，向青稞地里抢运肥料。全州今年计划种五万三千亩青稞，已经播种了四万多亩；六万多亩水稻也已经有一半以上撒好了秧。自治州今年还第一次播种了七千亩棉花。全州二十四万亩耕地往年只耕二、三寸，今年都翻了六寸到一尺以上；过去这里有60％的地不施肥，今年平均每亩施肥两万到四万多斤。全州一百三十多项水利工程已经全部完工，加上去年兴修的水利工程，灌溉面积已经接近二十万亩。生产工具和运输工具也有了巨大的改革，往年只有奴隶主才有的“二牛抬杠”老木犁，现在已经成为落后的农具。从春耕开始到现在，全州劳动力出勤率始终保持在90％以上。
    迪庆藏族自治州这些欣欣向荣的新气象是实行民主改革以前所没有的。过去，这里每到最适宜春耕播种的时候，草原上仍然冷冷清清。虽然已经到了农时，但还要等待统治者们选好“吉日”，首先为地主、领主和奴隶主们去服无偿的劳役，然后才能耕种自己的土地。农民们使用的农具也是很落后的，60％以上庄稼不施肥、不锄草。因此，直到两三年以前，全州粮食作物每亩平均才收一百多斤。经过党和政府的领导和大力扶持，到实行民主改革的前夕，每亩平均产量达到了二百五十多斤，但是，由于社会制度没有改革，粮食往往刚收下来，就被地主、领主或苏卡拿走了。70％以上的农民连三个月的口粮都没有，不得不依靠政府的大量救济过活。
    1958年初，在广大藏族同胞的迫切要求下，自治州实行了民主改革，上千户奴隶得到了人身自由，分得了土地。在民主改革中，藏族群众中出现了第一批共产主义战士——三百多名共产党员，广大群众在他们的带动下，已经组成了三十八个高级社和两个初级社。个别地方已成立人民公社。获得解放的藏族群众，去年就掀起了一个生产高潮，他们兴修了一百多项水利工程，在自己的语汇中，第一次出现了“抗旱”、“水利”这些与自然作斗争的字眼。1958年全州粮食增产了35％，每人平均达到了七百六十多斤，并且因为进行了民主改革，再也受不到领主们的剥削了，基本上够全年食用；同时为今年掀起更大的生产高潮打下了良好的基础。现在，藏民们正满怀信心地为实现今年的生产指标而辛勤劳动。
