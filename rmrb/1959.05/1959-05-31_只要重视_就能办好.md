If We Pay Attention, We Can Do It Well
    Jiangxi Provincial Commercial Bureau, Infrastructure Construction and Storage Department
    Last year, China's industrial and agricultural production leaped forward, and the demand for packaging supplies increased accordingly. Because packaging raw materials could not meet the needs all at once, our production temporarily could not keep up, and the supply of packaging supplies was once tight. The Party Group of the Provincial Department of Commerce held a special research meeting on the issue of packaging, and decided to implement the principle of "the whole country as one chessboard," focusing on local materials and self-reliance, supplemented by external assistance. We adopted ten measures, including purchase, recycling, cherishing, repairing, loose sales, substitutes, self-reliance, assistance, and application, mobilizing all levels to break through the packaging barrier.
    In order to tap the potential of social packaging supplies, commercial departments at all levels used various propaganda tools to widely publicize specific methods for purchasing old packaging and adopted methods such as setting up points and door-to-door purchases. From cities to villages, a huge purchase network was established to vigorously organize the recovery of packaging supplies. Tan Kehai, a packaging purchase pacesetter from the Duchang County Commercial Bureau, walked through 18 townships in 20 days, purchasing more than ten kinds of old wooden boxes, weighing more than 25,000 catties. The Provincial Department of Commerce also reasonably arranged recycling prices, and the amount of recycling increased rapidly. The amount recycled by the Nanchang Electrical Appliance Station alone increased from the original 40% to 80%.
    In the past, some units did not strictly manage packaging supplies, neither keeping accounts nor assigning dedicated personnel, allowing them to be exposed to the sun and rain, resulting in great losses and waste. Since the commercial departments put forward the slogan of "not wasting a piece of board, a rope, a nail, or an inch of wire," cherishing packaging supplies has become a trend. Generally, management systems have been established, unpacking is done carefully, and packaging supplies are kept from being damaged as much as possible. For damaged packaging supplies, ways are found to process and repair them. The packaging factory of the storage and transportation station purchased broken boards and waste materials, which were repaired, processed, and modified into more than 10,000 soap boxes, horizontal baskets, and medicine cartons, and more than 300 wooden boxes, turning waste into treasure. Many areas have also implemented the method of selling in bulk and preparing their own packaging on the basis of vigorous publicity. Now, some retail departments in the city automatically bring packaging to the wholesale station to pack goods, which greatly accelerates the turnover rate of packaging supplies.
    We have also achieved some success in our work of advancing towards substitutes. For example, in Linchuan County, there was a shortage of linen for wrapping cotton. The County Commercial Bureau assisted the cotton ginning factory in making bamboo strips to replace the linen for wrapping cotton. This kind of bamboo strip is neat, beautiful, and durable. It can reduce the cost by 42% compared with linen wrapping. According to the annual demand, it can save the country more than 40,000 yuan.
    Our province has needed hundreds of thousands of zhang of mat wrappers for tea packaging every year, all of which were purchased from Guangdong. This year, because they are undertaking export tasks, they cannot supply a large amount. We use the method of taking materials locally and self-reliance to solve the problem. For example, the Wuyuan Tea Factory purchased a batch of mat grass from Guangdong and made 43 wooden mat weaving machines. A mat wrapper weaving workshop was added to the factory to produce its own mat wrappers. In addition, with the attention of the county party committee and the active support of the people's communes, the factory was allocated 13 mu of paddy fields to grow its own mat grass. With the mat grass helped by the Qiukou and Zhenzhu People's Communes, it is estimated that the required mat wrappers can basically be self-sufficient after the third quarter of this year.
    Close contact with all parties, mutual adjustment, and mutual support are also important methods for solving packaging supplies. If there is a shortage of linen bags, in addition to finding ways to solve part of the problem within the province, we also signed a processing contract with Jiangsu Province for 500,000 pieces. Without affecting the quality of packaging, many improvements have also been made to the production of packaging materials. For example, the Xingan County Commercial Bureau used some small mountain bamboo to mix into mandarin orange baskets, reformed part of the structure, and saved 20% of Mao bamboo. The Zhangzhou Cotton Ginning Factory in Jiujiang County reformed the baling machine, compressed the packaging volume by 50%, and saved the country more than 40,000 yuan.
    In addition to the above methods, for the main packaging materials distributed uniformly by the state, such as bamboo, wood, and sacks, we planned them in advance and applied for allocation in a timely manner, while making full use of all usable packaging materials.
    Packaging work serves the production and transportation of goods. Without packaging, the production and transportation of goods will be affected. Therefore, leaders at all levels need to pay attention to packaging while grasping the production of goods. We believe that this is an important guarantee for solving the problem of packaging materials.

    只要重视  就能办好
    江西省商业局基建储运处
    去年我国工农业生产突飞猛进，包装用品需用量相对增加。由于包装原材料不能一下子满足需要，我们生产一时跟不上去，包装用品一度供应紧张。商业厅党组为此特召开了一个包装问题的专题研究会议，决定在贯彻全国一盘棋的方针下，以就地取材、自力更生为主，外援为副的原则，采取收购、回笼、爱惜、修整、散售、代用、自力更生、协助、申请等十大措施，上下齐动手，突破包装关。
    为了挖掘社会包装用品潜力，各级商业部门运用各种宣传工具，广为宣传收购旧包装的具体办法，并采取设点和登门收购等方式，从城市到农村，建立了一个庞大的收购网，大力组织包装用品回收。都昌县商业局包装收购工作尖兵谭克海，在二十天的时间里，走了十八个乡（镇），收购了十多种旧木箱，重达两万五千多斤。商业厅还合理安排了回收价格，回收数量迅速增长，仅南昌交电站回收的数量就由原来40％提高到80％。
    过去有些单位对包装用品的管理工作不严，既不记账，也无专人负责，任其日晒雨淋，损失浪费很大。自从商业部门提出不浪费一块板、一根绳、一颗洋钉、一寸铁丝的行动口号后，爱惜包装用品已经成为一种风气，一般都建立了管理制度，拆包细致，尽量不使包装用品破损。对于已破损了的包装用品，就想办法加工修理。储运站包装厂收购的破板废料，经修整加工改制成肥皂箱、横筐、药品纸箱一万多只，木箱三百多只，变废品为财宝。许多地区在大力宣传的基础上，还实行了散售自备包装的办法，现在市内零售部门有的自动带包装到批发站来装商品，大大地加速了包装用品的周转利用率。
    我们在向代用品进军的工作中，也取得了一些成就，如临川县包棉花的麻布不足，县商业局就协助轧花厂，制成竹篾代替包棉花麻布。这种竹篾整齐、美观、耐用，比麻布包可以降低成本42％，根据全年需用量计算，可为国家节约四万多元。
    我省历年来包茶叶的席包需要几十万丈，都是从广东购进，今年由于他们担负了外销的任务，不能大量供应了，我们就用就地取材、自力更生的方法来解决。如婺源茶厂从广东采购一批席草，自制四十三台木质编席机，厂内增设一个织席包车间，自己生产席包。另外在县委的重视和人民公社的积极支持下，又拨给这个厂水田十三亩，自己种植席草，加上秋口和珍珠两个人民公社帮助种的席草，预计在今年三季度以后，所需席包基本上可做到自给自足。
    密切联系各方，互相调剂，互相支援，也是解决包装用品的一个重要方法。麻布包不足，除省内自行设法解决一部分外，又跟江苏省签订五十万匹加工合同。在不影响包装质量的前提下，对包装材料的生产还作了不少改进。如新干县商业局利用部分小山竹掺制柑桔篓，改革部分结构，节约毛竹20％。九江县张洲轧花厂改革打包机，压缩包装体积50％，为国家节约四万多元。
    除采取上述几个办法外，对于国家统一分配的主要包装物资竹、木、麻袋等等，都事前计划好，在尽量利用一切可以利用的包装物料原则下，及时申请调拨。
    包装工作是为商品生产运输服务的。没有包装，就会影响商品的生产和运输，因此就需要各级领导同志在抓商品生产的同时，也要注意抓好包装，我们认为这是解决包装材料问题的重要保证。
