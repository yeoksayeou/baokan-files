　　"Backward Teams" Are Not "Born Backward"
　　The Facts of Shuangmiao Commune in Henan and Leiding Commune in Anhui Show That As Long as Leadership is Strengthened, the Appearance of Backward Teams Can Change Quickly
　　(Our report) The Party Committee of Shuangmiao People's Commune in Xiangcheng County, Henan Province, has strengthened its leadership over backward production teams, which has not only rapidly changed the appearance of backward production teams, but also created a new situation of leaping forward in the entire commune.

　　The Shuangmiao People's Commune has a total of twenty-seven brigades. Among them, the output of five brigades has been very low for years, only equal to half of that of advanced teams. Since the establishment of the People's Commune, the commune Party committee has earnestly strengthened its specific leadership over backward teams, making great changes in the backward appearance of these teams. This year, the wheat growth of these teams is generally good, and three of them have won the red flag of honor several times in the spring plowing and wheat field management competitions.

　　Thoroughly destroying the "born backward" theory is an important reason for the Shuangmiao Commune to change the appearance of backward teams. In August last year, the commune Party committee selected a group of excellent cadres to strengthen the leadership of backward teams. At the beginning, some cadres had many wrong understandings of backward teams, believing that the masses in backward teams had low awareness and that work was difficult to do, even saying that they were "born backward." Therefore, instead of patiently helping backward teams overcome difficulties in their work, they simply criticized and accused them. In order to change these wrong understandings among cadres, the commune Party committee led the entire commune in launching a great debate on whether backward teams were "born backward." In the debate, the Xu Village and Yangshuguo brigades were taken as examples to criticize various erroneous ideas about backward production teams. Before agricultural cooperativization, these two brigades were the poorest villages in the local area, with similar conditions; however, after cooperativization, due to the strong leadership and great enthusiasm of the masses in the Xu Village brigade, they had bumper harvests year after year. Now the output of various crops in this team is the highest in the entire commune. On the other hand, the Yangshuguo brigade, because of its weak leading backbone and low production enthusiasm, still has the lowest output of various crops in the entire commune. Through this debate, many cadres saw the huge potential contained in backward teams and recognized that the key to backward teams catching up with advanced teams quickly lies in earnestly strengthening leadership and giving full play to the subjective initiative of the masses. After the debate, many cadres went to work in backward teams with full confidence.

　　Since these five backward brigades were the teams with the worst economic foundation in the local area, the commune Party committee gave them necessary material support. For example, when planting wheat, according to the principles of voluntariness and equivalent exchange, advanced production teams were organized to dispatch people and animals to help these teams cultivate the land, and necessary care was also given in the allocation and purchase of means of production such as farm tools and livestock.

　　After earnestly strengthening the leadership over backward teams, not only did the backward appearance of these teams change rapidly, but it also greatly stimulated the production enthusiasm of advanced and intermediate teams, and a high tide of socialist labor competition appeared in the entire commune. Because some of the original backward teams became the red flag teams of the entire commune, it powerfully broke the complacency of some cadres and masses in the "old red flag teams" who believed that "the red flag was a sure thing." The Xu Village brigade, which had been inseparable from the red flag during the advanced agricultural cooperative, had developed complacency among some cadres and masses for a long time. In a recent evaluation last winter, the total score of this old red flag team was only one point higher than that of the Song Village brigade, which had always been backward, which surprised them greatly. They proposed to resolutely maintain the red flag, and the cadres and masses of the entire team were particularly energetic, and the production situation was completely renewed. Many past intermediate teams, under the promotion of backward teams, have also formulated plans to strive to catch up with the level of advanced teams. (Kan Feng)

　　(Our report) When reporters visited the Huangqiao team of the Leiding Commune in Lai'an County, Anhui, they saw that the production of this team was well-organized and the members were full of energy. The members happily told reporters that since Yao Zhen, the second secretary of the county party committee, came to the team to help, they have changed from a backward team to an upstream team.

　　The members said that before April, the Huangqiao team was one of the several backward teams in the Leiding Commune. At that time, the cadre force was weak, and the higher-level leaders did not provide specific help. There was no specific production plan in the team, the labor force lacked proper arrangement, and some bad elements created disturbances, so production was not done well.

　　County Party Secretary Yao Zhen came to the Huangqiao team in early April. As soon as he arrived, he held a chat with cadres and farmers to understand everyone's thoughts and help everyone analyze the reasons for the team's backwardness. At the same time, he helped to formulate this year's production plan and made reasonable arrangements for the use of labor.

　　The next day, Yao Zhen convened a meeting of members to help everyone summarize the achievements of 1958 and mobilize members to discuss this year's production plan. The masses were very touched to see the county party secretary helping them formulate such a detailed and specific production plan, and they expressed their determination to realize it at the meeting.

　　On the third day, the members worked according to the team's division of labor, full of energy. In the evening, the members carried out evaluations. The enthusiasm of the masses for production was encouraged. On the fourth day, Lao Yao helped the team find many ways to accumulate fertilizer, and the members' enthusiasm for accumulating fertilizer also increased.

　　Yao Zhen stayed in the Huangqiao team for four days, mobilized the masses to struggle against the landlord elements and bad elements who were creating disturbances, and made specific arrangements for production, which changed the appearance of this production team. The captain of this team said: "Lao Yao's trip to our place has made the work much easier, and I also have confidence in being the captain. In the past, higher-level cadres came and just talked and left, and there was always no direction for the team's work." At present, all the full and semi-labor force of the whole team are on duty. All 192 mu of paddy fields in the whole team have been cultivated six times, and most of them have been fertilized with base fertilizer. The paddy fields are also managed very well, and the quality has caught up with the advanced teams. In the recent four production evaluations of the Huangqiao brigade, this team was rated as an "upstream team" four times and won two red flags.

### “落后队”并非“天生落后”  河南双庙公社、安徽雷定公社的事实说明  只要加强领导，落后队面貌很快就能改变

    “落后队”并非“天生落后”
    河南双庙公社、安徽雷定公社的事实说明
    只要加强领导，落后队面貌很快就能改变
    本报讯　河南省襄城县双庙人民公社党委会加强对落后生产队的领导，不但迅速改变了落后生产队的面貌，而且使全社出现了齐步跃进的新局面。
    双庙人民公社共有二十七个大队。其中，五个大队历年产量很低，只等于先进队的一半。自从人民公社建立以后，公社党委会认真加强对落后队的具体领导，使这些队的落后面貌大为改观。今年，这些队的麦子生长普遍较好，其中有三个大队在春耕和麦田管理竞赛中，连续几次夺得了优胜红旗。
    大破“天生落后论”，是双庙公社改变落后队面貌的重要原因。去年8月，公社党委选拔了一批优秀干部，加强落后队的领导，开始有一部分干部对落后队存在许多错误认识，认为落后队群众觉悟低，工作难办，甚至说什么“天生落后”。因此在工作上不是耐心地帮助落后队克服困难，而是一味地批评指责。为了改变干部中的这些错误认识，公社党委领导全社展开了一场落后队是不是“天生落后”的大辩论。在辩论中，以徐庄和杨树郭两个大队为例，批驳了对落后生产队的各种错误思想。这两个大队在农业合作化前，都是当地最穷的村庄，各项条件都差不多；但在合作化后，由于徐庄大队的领导强，群众干劲大，因而连年丰收，现在这个队的各项作物产量都是全社最高的。而杨树郭大队，因为领导骨干较弱，生产积极性不高，至今各样作物产量都是全社最低的。通过这场辩论，不少干部看到了落后队蕴藏着巨大的潜力，认清了落后队迅速赶上先进队的关键在于认真地加强领导，充分发挥群众的主观能动性。辩论后，许多干部都信心百倍地深入到落后队工作。
    由于这五个落后大队都是当地经济基础最差的队，所以公社党委给予必要的物质支援。例如种麦时，根据自愿和等价交换原则，组织先进生产队抽调人、畜帮助这些队耕种，在农具和牲畜等生产资料的分配和购置上，也给予必要的照顾。
    认真加强对落后队的领导后，不但这些队的落后面貌迅速改变，而且大大激励了先进队和中间队的生产热情，全社出现了社会主义劳动竞赛高潮。由于一些原来的落后队成为全社的红旗队，有力地打破了“老红旗队”的一部分干部和群众认为“红旗稳拿”的自满心情。在高级农业社时便是红旗不离手的徐庄大队，过去很长时期以来，在一部分干部和群众中，滋长了自满情绪。去年冬季的一次评比中，这个老红旗队的总分数只比过去一贯落后的松庄大队多一分，使他们大吃一惊，提出要坚决保住红旗，全队干部、群众精神格外奋发，生产面貌为之一新。许多过去的中间队，在落后队的推动下，也都制订了计划，力争赶上先进队的水平。（阚枫）
    本报讯　记者访问安徽来安县雷定公社的黄桥小队时，看到这个队的生产井然有序，社员们干劲十足。社员们高兴地告诉记者，自从县委第二书记姚震来队帮助后，他们已由落后队变成上游队了。
    社员们说，黄桥小队在4月以前是雷定公社几个落后队中的一个。那时，干部力量薄弱，上级领导也没有具体帮助，队里生产没有具体计划，劳动力缺乏适当安排，加以有坏分子捣乱，生产搞得不好。
    县委书记姚震4月初来到了黄桥小队。他一到便召开了干部、农民漫谈会，了解了大家的思想情况，帮助大家分析了小队落后的原因。同时帮助订出了今年的生产计划，在劳力使用上作了合理的安排。
    第二天，姚震召开了社员大会，帮助大家总结了1958年的成绩，发动社员讨论了今年的生产计划。群众见县委书记帮助自己订出这样详细具体的生产计划，都很感动，在会上纷纷表示要坚决实现它。
    第三天社员都按照队里的分工干活，干劲十足。晚上社员们开展了评比。群众生产的积极性鼓舞起来了。第四天，老姚又帮助这个队找出了许多积肥的办法；社员们的积肥劲头也大了。
    姚震在黄桥小队住了四天，发动群众对捣乱的地主分子和坏分子进行了斗争，把生产作了具体安排，使这个生产队的面貌有了改变。这个队的队长说：“老姚来我们这里一趟，工作好做多了，我当队长也有信心了。过去上级干部来只是讲讲就走了，队里工作老没有个方向。”目前，全队的整半劳动力全部出勤。全队一百九十二亩水田耕过六遍，大部施了底肥，稻田也管理得非常好，质量赶上了先进队。在最近黄桥大队的四次生产评比中，这个小队四次都评为“上游队”，获得了两面红旗。
