To the Tibet Work Committee, forwarded to the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China:

    We express our utmost joy and excitement in congratulating the election of the national leaders. The election of Comrade Liu Shaoqi, the close comrade-in-arms of the great leader of all ethnic groups, Chairman Mao, as Chairman of the Central People's Government, as well as the selection of the new national leaders, is a great joyous event for all ethnic groups in our country, and it is also the leadership that the people of Tibet have long supported and wholeheartedly loved. To this end, the monks and laypeople of Tibet extend warm congratulations and heartfelt support from the distant border region. The Panchen Kanpo Lija Committee and its affiliated monks and laypeople are willing to take practical actions to firmly adhere to the anti-imperialist and patriotic stance, under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, under the leadership of the new national leaders, and under the direct leadership of the CPC Tibet Work Committee and the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, to actively assist the Chinese People's Liberation Army in swiftly and thoroughly eliminating the remaining Tibetan rebels, and resolutely march towards the socialist road together with all the people, and contribute to building Tibet into a true paradise on earth. Respectfully submitted by the Panchen Kanpo Lija Committee and all monks and laypeople.
