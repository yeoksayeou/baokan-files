Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 2nd. Our correspondent accompanying the army reports: When the People's Liberation Army Tibet Military Region's pacification forces swept through the Shannan area to suppress the bandits, they were warmly welcomed and strongly supported by the Tibetan compatriots along the way. The local Tibetan compatriots tearfully recounted the towering crimes of the bandits to the pacification army, demanding that the army thoroughly eliminate the remaining bandits as soon as possible.

On the road of the pacification army's advance, it was common to see Tibetan compatriots from various villages gathered by the roadside, at the entrances of villages, or on rooftops, joyfully welcoming the pacification army. Some elderly people piously clasped their hands together and chanted scriptures to wish the People's Liberation Army "peace all the way" and "early elimination of the bandits." When the Tibetan compatriots in a village on the banks of the Niuyang River in Zela Zong heard that the pacification army was about to pass through, the children picked fresh red peach blossoms and clipped tender green willow branches early in the morning. When the People's Liberation Army arrived, they presented bunches of flowers to the soldiers and hung hadas on them. When another pacification army arrived in Linzhi, hundreds of Tibetan compatriots presented flowers and greetings to the pacification army, and shouted slogans wishing the army an early victory and thoroughly annihilating the bandits for them.

Wherever the pacification army went, the broad masses of Tibetan compatriots immediately reported the bandit situation to the People's Liberation Army, reported the guns, ammunition, and materials hidden by the bandits, helped the People's Liberation Army repair bridges and roads, and prepared mules, horses, and provisions to fully support the pacification army in combat. When the People's Liberation Army was pursuing and suppressing the bandits in Gongga Zong, the bandits dug four trenches across the road, attempting to block our army's advance. As soon as the bandits fled, the local Tibetan compatriots immediately filled the trenches on the road, allowing the pacification army to advance smoothly. As soon as the People's Liberation Army, which was suppressing bandits in the Linzhi area, arrived, the local Tibetan compatriots formed a mule and horse transport team overnight, carrying ammunition and provisions, and followed the People's Liberation Army to pursue and suppress the remaining bandits. When the Tibetan woman Tawa Zhuoma was crossing a dangerous bridge, the horse was killed after falling off a cliff due to the high mountains and steep roads. She took the initiative to climb down the cliff and carried two boxes of shells weighing more than forty kilograms on her back, continuously traveling more than forty li, and finally caught up with the troops. She said: "To fight the bandits, these things cannot be lost." Many Tibetan compatriots traveled dozens of li to prepare food and grass for our army. Ma A Ma from Bomu said: "We are very happy that the People's Liberation Army has eliminated the bandits. Helping the People's Liberation Army is something we should do."

The Tibetan compatriots in the Shannan area, celebrating their new life, accused the bandits of their heinous crimes when they saw the pacification army. The bandits raped nuns, young girls, and old women in Zedang, and some of the violated women became mentally deranged. In Baga Xueka, most of the women in the village were raped and violated, including women named Anmu, Ci Shi Zhuoma, Langga Zhuoma, Baimu, and Anyu, who were all gang-raped by the bandits.

The Tibetan compatriots accused the bandits of plundering their cattle, sheep, horses, grain, and clothing. In the two small villages of Meilin Xueka, all eighteen households were looted by the bandits. The bandits forbade people from hanging portraits of Chairman Mao, the leader of all ethnic groups, and forbade people from reading Han Chinese pictorials. If they disobeyed, they would be whipped or killed with knives. In Qunma Liu, a Tibetan compatriot named Yan Qiong was beaten to death by the bandits for refusing to send horses to the bandits. When people accused the People's Liberation Army of these tragic events, they all wept bitterly. They unanimously demanded that the People's Liberation Army thoroughly eliminate these inhumane jackals.

    山南藏胞大力支援平叛大军
    纷纷控诉叛匪罪行，要求彻底肃清灭绝人性的豺狼
    新华社拉萨2日电　本社随军记者报道：人民解放军西藏军区平叛部队向山南地区扫荡叛匪时，受到沿途藏胞热情欢迎和大力支援。当地藏胞纷纷向平叛大军哭诉叛匪的滔天罪行，要求大军早日彻底肃清残匪。
    在平叛部队进军的路上，经常看到各个村庄的藏胞聚集在公路旁、村头上或屋顶上，喜笑颜开地迎送平叛大军。有些老人虔诚地合掌诵经祝人民解放军“一路平安”、
  “早日消灭叛匪”。则拉宗尼洋河畔的一个村庄的藏胞听说平叛大军要经过那里时，孩子们一清早就折下鲜红的桃花，夹上嫩绿的柳枝，等解放军到时，就把一束束的花朵送到战士们手里，把一条条的哈达挂在战士们的身上。另一支平叛大军进抵林芝时，成百上千的藏胞向平叛大军献花、问好，并高呼口号预祝大军早得胜，给他们彻底剿灭叛匪。
    平叛大军每到一地，广大藏胞立即向解放军报告匪情，报告叛匪匿藏的枪弹、物资，帮助解放军修桥补路，筹备骡马粮草等，全力支援平叛大军作战。人民解放军在追剿贡嘎宗的叛匪时，叛匪曾在公路上挖了四条横沟，妄图阻挡我军的前进。叛匪刚一逃窜，当地藏胞立即把公路上的壕沟填平，使平叛大军顺利前进。进剿林芝一带叛匪的人民解放军刚一到达，当地藏胞连夜组成一支骡马运输队，驮着弹药、粮草，随着解放军追剿残匪。藏族妇女塔华卓玛在过一条险桥时，由于山高路陡，马被摔死在崖下，她就主动下崖背起四十多斤的两箱炮弹，连续赶了四十多华里，终于追上了部队。她说：“为了打叛匪，这些东西是丢不得的。”许多藏胞奔走于数十里外为我军筹备粮草。博姆的玛阿妈说：“解放军消灭了叛匪，我们心里很高兴。帮助解放军，是我们应该做的事情。”
    欢庆新生的山南地区藏胞见到平叛大军时，纷纷控诉叛匪的滔天罪行。叛匪在泽当强奸尼姑、幼女和老太婆，有些被蹂躏的妇女以致神经失常。在八嘎雪卡地方，村里妇女大都遭到奸辱和蹂躏，其中有名叫安姆、慈什卓玛、郎嘎卓玛、白姆、阿纽等妇女，均遭到叛匪的轮奸。
    藏胞们指控叛匪抢掠他们的牛、羊、马匹、粮食和衣物等等。在美林雪卡的两个小村庄里，仅有的十八户人家都被叛匪洗劫一空。叛匪不准人们张挂各族人民的领袖毛主席的画像，不准人们看汉人的画报，如稍有不从，便要遭受皮鞭的毒打或用刀砍死。在群马溜有位名叫燕琼的藏胞，因为拒绝给叛匪派马，而被叛匪活活打死。当人们向解放军控诉这些悲惨事情的时候，无不痛哭流涕。他们一致要求解放军彻底肃清这些灭绝人性的豺狼。
