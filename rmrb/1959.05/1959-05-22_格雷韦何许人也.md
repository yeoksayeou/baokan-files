    Who is Grewe?
    Question: Who is Grewe, the West German representative attending the Geneva Conference?
    Beijing, Chen Li
    Answer: Grewe is a veteran Nazi and one of Hitler's key war policy advisors. After Hitler's downfall, Grewe became a close confidant of Adenauer and is currently the West German ambassador to the United States.
    Grewe was a professor at the Fascist Political Academy, and Western journalists covering the Geneva Conference still call him "Professor." The bloodthirsty "theories" he advocated are chilling. In 1940, he wrote in "Political Magazine" demanding the destruction of all churches, palaces, theaters, colleges, courts, halls, triumphal arches, colonnades, stock exchanges, banks, city halls, and bridges in Paris, as a conclusion to "realistic thinking." In 1942, in an article published in the same magazine, he argued that eliminating all opponents of the Nazi regime and exterminating all the people of the world were not guilty acts.
    Grewe was a proponent of the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union. In 1941, Grewe published an article in the "Monthly Journal of Foreign Policy," founded by the Fascist German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, in which he praised Hitler's crimes of aggression against the Soviet Union as follows: "No one would deny that the decision of June 22nd was not based on very practical considerations. According to all historical experience, great world historical missions do not remain in the realm of fantasy, but always tend to begin in this way." Grewe also openly wrote against the Soviet government's proposal to mutually abide by the Geneva Conventions and the Hague Conventions on land warfare, advocating the use of cruel means violating international law to abuse and slaughter Soviet prisoners of war. He wrote: "This war in fact no longer belongs to the category of traditional laws of war and neutrality suitable for national wars."
    Although the German fascist regime collapsed, Grewe, the fascist strategist, was still very useful. Like his loyalty to his "Führer" Hitler, he supported Adenauer and served as the Director of the Legal Department of the West German Foreign Ministry. In 1954, he participated in the formulation of the Paris Agreements to revive West German militarism. He was also a vanguard in the Bonn government for rearmament and preparation for war, playing an important role in the formulation of West Germany's "Compulsory Military Service Law," the anti-people "Emergency Law," and the "Election Law" to maintain Adenauer's reactionary rule. In July 1955, Grewe was reassigned as the Director of the Political Department of the West German Foreign Ministry. He was extremely hostile to the German Democratic Republic and demanded at the West German Ambassadors' Conference that any recognition of the German Democratic Republic be regarded as an unfriendly act. As West German Ambassador to the United States, Grewe vehemently opposed the establishment of a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe, demanding the annexation of the German Democratic Republic by means of counter-revolutionary provocations and military actions.
    The reason why Grewe is now able to lead the West German delegation to the Geneva Conference in place of von Brentano is not only because he is an active supporter of Adenauer's policies, but also because he has experience in obstructing the peaceful resolution of the German question. During the Four Foreign Ministers' Conference in Berlin in 1954, Grewe participated in the West German government delegation to Berlin to prevent the conference from hearing the opinions of the two German representatives and to prevent the conference from making any progress on the German question.

    格雷韦何许人也
    问：出席日内瓦会议的西德代表格雷韦，是个什么样的人？
    北京　陈里
    答：格雷韦是老牌纳粹分子、希特勒战争政策的重要谋士之一。希特勒垮台后，格雷韦又成为阿登纳的亲信，现任西德驻美大使。
    格雷韦曾任法西斯政治学院教授，至今报道日内瓦会议的西方记者还称呼他为教授。他鼓吹的嗜血“理论”，使人毛骨悚然。1940年他在“政治杂志”上撰文要求毁坏巴黎所有的教堂、宫殿、剧院、学院、法院、厅堂、凯旋门、柱廊、交易所、银行、市政厅和桥梁，作为“现实主义思考”的结论。1942年，他在同一杂志上发表的文章认为，消灭纳粹制度的一切反对者和灭绝全世界人民都不是什么有罪的行为。
    格雷韦是纳粹进攻苏联的罪行的鼓吹者。1941年，格雷韦曾在法西斯德国外交部长里宾特洛甫创办的“外交政策月刊”上，对希特勒侵袭苏联的罪行作了如下的颂扬：“没有一个人肯断言，6月22日的决定不是出自很实际的考虑。根据所有的历史经验，伟大的世界历史使命不会停留在空想阶段上，而总是惯于用这种方式开始的。”格雷韦还公然撰文反对苏联政府提出的互相遵守日内瓦公约和海牙陆战公约的建议，主张用违反国际法的残酷手段虐待和屠杀苏联战俘。他写道：“这场战争事实上已不属于适合民族国家战争的流传的战争法和中立法的范畴”。
    德国法西斯政权虽然垮台了，但格雷韦这个法西斯谋士依然大有用武之地。他像忠于他的“元首”希特勒那样，支持阿登纳，担任了西德外交部法律司司长的职务。1954年他参预了制订复活西德军国主义的巴黎协定的工作。他又是波恩政府中重新武装，准备战争的急先锋，在制订西德的“义务兵役法”、反人民的“紧急法案”以及保持阿登纳的反动统治的“选举法”的工作里，起了重要的作用。1955年7月，格雷韦改任西德外交部政治司司长。他极端敌视德意志民主共和国，曾在西德大使会议上要求把任何对德意志民主共和国的承认都看作是不友好的行为。作为西德驻美大使的格雷韦，竭力反对建立中欧无原子武器区，要求用反革命挑衅和军事行动的办法来并吞德意志民主共和国。
    现在格雷韦所以能够代替勃伦塔诺率领西德代表团出席日内瓦会议，不仅因为他是阿登纳政策的积极支持者，而且还由于他还有过阻挠和平解决德国问题的经验。1954年四国外长在柏林举行会议的期间，格雷韦曾参加西德政府代表团前往柏林，阻挠会议听取两个德国代表的意见，阻挠会议在德国问题上取得任何进展。
