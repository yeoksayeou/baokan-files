Shanghai, May 7th (Reporter) - An important leadership method of the Pengpu Machine Factory in Shanghai to achieve a great leap forward in production this year is to focus on group work. Because this work is grasped deeply and meticulously, giving full play to the organizational role of the groups, the factory's production has risen rapidly.

The Pengpu Machine Factory was only formed at the end of last year by merging a batch of small and medium-sized factories. Although the factory is large, its management work is still at the level of a small factory. The production tasks undertaken by this factory this year are mostly six major equipment such as rolling mills and coke ovens. The factory's Party committee believes: "A tall building rises from the ground, and all small rivers flow into the sea." The group is the most basic combat unit. All aspects of the factory's production, management, and technological innovation will eventually converge to the group. Through this cell organization, it will be concretely implemented in every machine tool and every worker. Therefore, the Party committee regards strengthening group work and making the foundation of the factory's production work solid as one of the important methods to complete this year's arduous tasks.

For more than a month, leading cadres from the factory, workshops, and work sections have been selecting key groups to cultivate experimental plots, participating in labor, helping groups improve their work, and promptly summarizing and exchanging experiences in group work. The activities of the groups have become unprecedentedly active. Many groups have established leading cores and have created many experiences in grasping ideology, grasping production, grasping management, and grasping mass technological innovation, such as heart-to-heart talks, pre-shift and post-shift meetings, the "four deliveries and one question" handover system, and the amateur inspector system.

Individual conversations and heart-to-heart talks have become a regular part of the group's democratic life. The group's political atmosphere is strong. When there are ideological problems or disagreements, the group uses these forms to solve them. Fan Caiguo and Yang Jinchu, workers in the second group of the small work section of the machining workshop, operated shifts on the same machine tool. In the past, neither of them was convinced by the other, and after work, each locked their own tools in the toolbox. Fan Caiguo, a member of the Communist Youth League, thought this was not right, so he took the initiative to say to Yang Jinchu: "I used to look down on you. From now on, let's use our tools together! We are all for production, not for personal gain." Yang Jinchu also examined his own shortcomings, and the problem between the two was resolved.

Originally, the cooperation between shifts in some groups was not close enough. The previous shift of workers did not tell the next shift about their good experiences, which was very detrimental to production. Later, the group workers created a "four deliveries and one question" system. When the previous shift of workers got off work, they handed over the drawings, machine tools, tools, and operating techniques to the next shift of workers, and after eating, they returned to the machine tool to ask the next shift of workers if there were any problems in production before going back. This system not only improved the quality of the products but also enabled the achievements of technological innovation to be quickly promoted.

After the red flag emulation campaign was launched, the output of the groups increased rapidly. The full-time inspectors in the workshop did not have time to inspect every machine tool, so the groups established an amateur inspector system. When the statistical work could not keep up, the groups organized each worker to make original records. The groups also established a "daily inspection, ten-day summary" system to ensure the balanced completion of the plan. After this series of systems was established, the situation and problems of each worker, each machine tool, each group, each work section, and workshop in completing tasks every day and every shift became clear at a glance on the same day.

The main method for the leaders of the Pengpu Machine Factory to grasp the groups is to first disclose the production plan, difficulties, leadership intentions, and main measures to achieve the plan to the groups on a monthly basis, and arrange the tasks to the groups. Then the group workers, according to the quality of the machine tools and the level of the workers' technical skills, carefully calculated and tapped the potential, and finally implemented the plan on every machine tool and every worker. In this way, everyone knew what to do, and every machine tool had a clear goal. In the process of the competition, the factory leaders also used the leadership method of grasping both ends (advanced and backward) to bring along the middle to promote the continuous progress of each group.

Because the group work was well grasped, the Pengpu Machine Factory overfulfilled the plan in the first quarter. In March, the 115 machine tools in the machining workshop completed an average of 1,225 working hours per machine, of which the six lathes in the second group of the small work section averaged more than 1,800 working hours; in the first half of April, it further rose to 2,000 working hours.

### 深入基层抓小组  彭浦机器厂工作做得细生产搞得好

　　深入基层抓小组
    彭浦机器厂工作做得细生产搞得好
    本报上海7日电　上海市彭浦机器厂实现今年生产大跃进的一项重要领导方法是抓好小组工作。由于这一工作抓得深入细致，充分发挥了小组的组织作用，全厂生产迅速上升。
    彭浦机器厂是去年年底才由一批中小工厂合并起来的，厂虽大，但管理工作却还停留在小厂的水平上。这个厂今年担负的生产任务大部分是轧钢机、炼焦等六大设备。厂党委认为：“万丈高楼平地起，条条小河归大海”，小组是最基层的战斗单位，工厂生产、管理、技术革新等各个方面的工作，最后都要汇聚到小组，通过这一细胞组织，具体地贯彻到每一台机床、每一个工人中去。因此，党委把健全小组工作，使全厂生产工作根基扎实，作为完成今年艰巨任务的重要方法之一。
    一个多月来，从厂部、车间到工段的各级领导干部，选择重点小组种试验田，参加劳动，帮助小组改进工作，并且及时总结和交流小组工作的经验。小组的活动空前活跃起来了。许多小组都建立了领导核心，在抓思想、抓生产、抓管理、抓群众性的技术革新等方面，创造了许多经验，如谈心会、班前班后会议、“四交一问”的交接班制度和业余检验员制度等。
    个别交谈和谈心会已经成为小组经常的民主生活。小组的政治空气浓厚了，当碰到有思想问题或互相有意见的时候，小组就运用这些形式加以解决。机械加工车间小型工段二组工人樊才国和杨金初，同在一台机床上调班操作，过去两人谁也不服谁，而且一下班，各人把自己的刀具锁在工具箱里。樊才国是个共青团员，想想这样不对头，就主动对杨金初说：“我过去看不起你，以后我们的刀子放在一起用吧！大家都是为生产，不是为了个人。”杨金初也检查了自己的缺点，两个人的疙瘩便解开了。
    原来有些小组，班与班之间的协作不够密切，上一班工人有了好的经验，也不告诉下一班，对生产很不利。以后，小组工人创造了“四交一问”制度，上一班工人下班时，向下一班工人交清图纸、机床、工具和操作技术，并且吃罢饭再回到机床旁，问接班工人生产上有无问题，然后才回去。这一制度，不仅提高了产品的质量，也使技术革新成就能够很快推广。
    红旗竞赛运动开展以后，小组的产量迅速增长，车间专职检验员来不及到每一台机床进行检验，小组于是建立起业余检验员制度。统计工作跟不上了，小组就组织每个工人做原始记录。小组还建立了“日日检查、旬旬小结”的制度，保证均衡地完成计划。这一系列制度建立起来以后，每个工人、每台机床、每个小组、每个工段和车间，每天每班完成任务的情况和问题，在当天就能一目了然。
    彭浦机器厂领导抓小组的主要办法，首先是按月把生产计划、困难、领导意图和实现计划的主要措施，向小组交底，把任务安排到小组。然后小组工人按照机床好坏、工人技术水平高低，算细账，挖潜力，最后把计划落实到每一台机床、每一个工人身上。这样，人人心中有数，台台机床有了明确的目标。在竞赛过程中，厂领导干部还运用了抓两头（先进和落后）带中间的领导方法，推动各个小组不断前进。
    由于抓好了小组工作这一环，彭浦机器厂第一季度超额完成了计划。机械加工车间的一百一十五台机床在3月份每台平均完成了一千二百二十五个工时的任务，其中小型工段二组的六台车床平均达到一千八百多工时；4月上半月更上升到二千工时。
