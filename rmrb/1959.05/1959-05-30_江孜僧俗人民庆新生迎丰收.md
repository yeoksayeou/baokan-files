Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, May 29th: Over seven thousand monastic and secular people in the Gyantse area of Tibet gathered from the 26th to the 28th, holding horse races, archery, artistic performances, and ball games to celebrate the victory of the suppression of the rebellion and to welcome the harvest year.

Now, on the fields along the fertile Nyang Chu River, the robust highland barley seedlings are a lush green. The Tibetan people of Gyantse have begun to live a peaceful and free life. From morning to night, the fields resound with cheerful labor songs.

Starting from the 26th, farmers, herdsmen, and lamas from the Gyantse area, dressed in summer clothing and carrying butter, zanba, highland barley wine, and dried beef, came to Gyantse. They set up dozens of green tents in the "Jitang" (New Life) Square on the banks of the Nyang Chu River to watch horse races, archery, and Tibetan opera performances. Before the performance began, Gesang, Deputy Director of the Office of the Gyantse Basic-level Office of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, gave a speech. He said that the broad masses of people in the Gyantse area, at this happy moment of celebrating the victory of the suppression of the rebellion and welcoming the harvest year, are very grateful to the Central People's Government and Chairman Mao for their deep concern for the Tibetan people. In the future, we must further strengthen our close unity, actively assist the People's Liberation Army in wiping out the bandits, strive for early reform, and struggle to build a bright and happy new Tibet.

More than two hundred farmers and herdsmen riders and archers selected from the Gyantse area, fully dressed in ancient costumes, carrying muskets and bows and arrows, performed riding skills and archery techniques and competitions. The winners of these performances received prizes from the Gyantse Basic-level Office.

During the three-day celebration, members of the Gyantse Patriotic Youth League and the Women's Federation performed songs and dances such as "Presenting Hada to Chairman Mao," "Loving Our Hometown," and "Harvest, Weaving," while the Gyantse Jianggar Tibetan Opera Troupe performed classical comedies such as "Angsa." Cadres from the Gyantse Sub-Work Committee of the Communist Party of China and Tibetan members of the Gyantse Patriotic Youth League also participated in friendly football, basketball, and other ball games.
