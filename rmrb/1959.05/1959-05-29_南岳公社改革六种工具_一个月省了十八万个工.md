    South Yue Commune Reforms Six Tools, Saving 180,000 Workdays in a Month
    By our reporter Zhou Rong
    Beneath Mount Zhurong, along the Yue Shan River. Members of the South Yue Commune in Hengshan, Hunan, are busy with inter-tilling, topdressing, and harvesting summer crops. According to the original production schedule, they have advanced and completed an extra 50,000 workdays. What has accelerated their pace?
    People can find the answer by looking at the site: it is due to the improvement and promotion of new-style tools.
    As soon as the east turned white, the green fields were abuzz. I came out of the commune party committee and walked not far before entering the fields of the Wanfu Production Brigade. In the early rice fields, commune members were using an improved new-style weeding and soil-loosening cultivator for inter-tilling. The cultivator's rollers struck the water and mud, making "pi pi pa pa" sounds. In one field, twenty-one-year-old female commune member Zhou Songying was competing with seven other men and women. Her movements were so skilled, one pull and one push completed a row. The weeds in the tilled rice rows were pulled out and pressed into the mud as green manure, and the soil was also loosened. Even though commune member Zhou Guoqing was chasing behind, she steadily advanced quickly. In ten minutes, she had tilled twenty zhang of rice rows. I asked Zhou Songying, "So fast, how many mu can you till in a day?" She said, "Generally, I can till 1.5 mu, and those who are faster can till 2 mu, which is on average about twice as fast as using feet to tread the fields. And the labor intensity is also reduced."
    They put a lot of effort into improving this cultivator. When transplanting was nearing completion, the commune party committee immediately mobilized everyone to improve tools for the next stage of production. Carpenter Liu Jijin has always been an active innovator. This time, he took the lead in responding to the party's call, determined to improve the current popular cultivator. Luo Xianyou, who was in charge of industry for the commune party committee, knew that Lao Liu was modifying the cultivator and took the initiative to help him with some ideas. Lao Liu was even more motivated and moved several cultivators he had created himself from upstairs. After comparing them, each had its weaknesses. The one created last year was better, but it still had the problem of not being able to remove weeds cleanly enough and requiring more effort. Whether it was during rest periods or late at night, they studied together. They thought and did, and asked the commune members while modifying it. A few days later, a new-style cultivator was born. The rectangular wooden clamp of this cultivator was shortened from one and a half chi to six cun, and changed to a six-degree arc-shaped rectangular wooden clamp. Four square weeding and soil-loosening iron teeth were nailed in the front, with a weeding and soil-loosening roller in the middle, and a leveling round roller at the back. One pull and one push completes a row. It's really fast and good! In just one week, there were 9,000 of the same new-style cultivators in the entire commune, almost one for every laborer. The cultivator replaced human feet treading the fields, saving a total of more than 80,000 workdays for the entire commune.
    With the improvement of the cultivator, people's minds became more enlightened, realizing that other fixed tools could also be further improved to increase work efficiency. Although the hand-pushed wheelbarrow was already standardized, the commune members proposed a plan for further improvement: a small wheel was installed in front of the cart. When passing through the water outlets in the fields, the small front wheel would bite the opposite bank, and the rear wheels would fly over, allowing unimpeded passage on the field ridges. At the same time, ball bearings were installed on the main wheel axles, as if wings had been added. Soon, the entire commune quickly modified 2,000 such wheelbarrows.
    In field after field, commune members are pushing fertilizer with these carts. Commune member Su Dongcheng's cart was loaded with about 700 jin, but it seemed easy to push. Secretary Liu of the Shigiao Bridge Brigade Party Branch told me that compared with the original carts, this cart can carry a quarter more. At present, everyone is vying to use this cart. Because the Dianmenqian Brigade found it difficult to modify more carts, they used them in shifts day and night, with people resting but the carts not resting. According to preliminary estimates, using this cart to transport fertilizer saves more than 90,000 workdays compared to carrying it on shoulders. These farmers are truly skilled!
    People have not neglected the innovation of summer harvesting tools. On a stretch of yellow rapeseed fields, people could be seen harvesting upright from afar. In the past, people harvesting rapeseed would bend over and cut with a sickle in handfuls; it was the first time I had seen rapeseed harvested upright like this. When I got closer, I saw clearly that they were using a "harvesting tool" to cut. At first glance, it seemed a bit novel. Commune member Xiao Chen pushed the harvesting tool straight forward, and the rapeseed stalks fell neatly on the tool's frame. How fast! The two people following behind picking and bundling were still a bit slow. The wooden drag base of this harvester has a live round wheel with a diameter of two and a half cun on each side, four and a half cun away from the back. The ingenuity lies in the two round wheels. The round wheels slide and roll in the soil, adapting to the unevenness. Soil clumps cannot stop it. At the same time, the blade maintains a proper distance from the ground, so the blade does not get into the soil or get damaged by stones in the soil. This was improved by carpenter Tan Qiuhe.
    Along the way, I also saw further improved water pumps. One person could crank it by hand, pumping water from a kan of more than zhang deep. The amount of water pumped was equivalent to two people pedaling a waterwheel. There was also a soil sprayer for killing insects. These tools were all two to three times faster than manual work.
    In the evening, Comrade Su Youyu, director of the commune party committee office, introduced to me: From April 16th to May 16th, the commune innovated six main tools for only five major agricultural tasks, such as early rice inter-tilling, topdressing, and summer harvesting, and has promoted more than 12,000 pieces. These tools alone are estimated to have saved more than 180,000 workdays in this month's production.

    南岳公社改革六种工具  一个月省了十八万个工
    本报记者　周荣
    祝融峰下，岳山河畔。湖南衡山南岳公社的社员们，在忙着中耕、追肥、收割夏熟作物。按照原订的生产进度，他们又提前多做了五万个劳动日。是什么加快了他们的步伐呢？
    人们到现场一看，就可以找到答案：这是由于改良和推广了新式工具。
    东方刚发白，绿色的田野沸腾起来，我从公社党委会出来走不多远，就进入了万福生产大队的田垅。在早稻田里，社员正拿着一种改进的新式除草松土中耕器在中耕，中耕器的滚轮页打着水和泥，发出“辟辟拍拍”的响声。在一丘田里，二十一岁的女社员周松英，正和七个男女社员比高低。她的动作是那么熟练，一拉一推就搞好了一行，中耕过的禾行里的野草，都被拔出压入泥底作沤肥、泥土也钩松了；尽管社员周国青在后面追赶，她还是沉着地快速前进。十来分钟，她就把二十丈长的一厢禾行中耕完了。我问周松英：“这么快，一天能中耕多少亩？”她说：“一般能中耕一亩五，快的可中耕二亩田，平均比人用脚踩田快二倍左右。而且劳动强度也减轻了。”
    改进这个中耕器，他们是费了一番心血的。当插秧接近尾声时，公社党委立即发动大家，围绕下一段生产改良工具。木工刘吉金，素来就是积极的革新者。这次他又一马当先响应党的号召，决心把当前普遍需要的中耕器加以改进提高。社党委管工业的罗贤佑，知道老刘在改中耕器，便主动去帮他出些点子。老刘劲头更足了，从楼上搬出了他亲手创制的几种中耕器。比比看看，各有弱点。去年创制的那种比较好，也还有除草不够干净和用力较大的毛病。无论是休息时间或是深夜，他们在一起研究。边想边做，边请教社员边改，几天后一种新式中耕器诞生了。这种中耕器的长方形木挟，由一尺五寸长缩短为六寸长，并改成六度弧形长方木挟。前面钉上四个方形除草松土铁齿，中间是除草松土滚轮，后面是平泥圆滚。前齿疏泥拔出野草、滚轮立即把草压入泥里、平泥滚平得泥巴坦平。一拉一推就搞好了一行。真是又快又好！只一个星期的时间，全公社就出现了九千个同样的新式中耕器，几乎每个劳力都有了一个。中耕器代替人脚踩田，全公社一共节省了八万多个劳动日。
    随着中耕器的改进提高，人们的心眼更开窍了，认识到其他定型的工具，还可以再作改进，再提高工效。手推鸡公车虽已定型，社员们这次又提出了进一步改进的计划：车子的前面装上个小轮盘，过田间放水的月口时，前面小轮咬住对岸，后轮随着飞纵而过，在田墈上通行无阻。同时，把主轮滚轴安上滚珠轴承，像添上了翅膀一般。很快全公社迅速改制了两千部这样的鸡公车。
    一个田垅又一个田垅上，社员们正用这种车子推着肥料。社员苏东城的车子足足装有七百来斤，看来推得却很轻快。师古桥大队党总支刘书记对我说，和原来的车子比较，这种车子要多载四分之一。眼前，个个都争着用这种车。店门前大队一下难以改制更多的车，就日夜轮流使用，人歇车不歇。据初步估算，用这种车子运肥比人用肩担要节省出九万多个劳动日。这些农民真是能手！
    夏收工具的革新工作，人们也没有放过。在一片连一片的黄澄澄的油菜地边，老远就看到人们在直立收割。以往，收割油菜的人，都是弯着腰，用镰一兜兜的割；像这样直立割油菜，我还是第一次看到。走近时，就看清了，他们原来都是利用“割禾器”在割。初见似乎有点新奇。社员小陈，拿着收割器一直往前推去，油菜秆子整齐地倒在收割器的档架上。多快啊！后面两人跟着边拣边捆，手脚还是有些跟不上。这种收割器的木拖底两边，在距后面四寸半的地方，两边各安了一个直径二寸半的活圆轮，巧就出在两个圆轮上。圆轮在土里滑滚着，适应高低，土团无法阻住它；同时使刀口和地面保持适当距离，刀口不致钻入土里或被土中石头碰坏。这是木工谭秋和改进的。
    一路上，我还看到了经过进一步改进后的抽水机，一个人手摇，从丈多深的墈下抽上水来，出水量相当两人脚踏水车那么大。还有那杀虫的土喷雾器。这些工具都比人工干活要快两三倍。
    晚上，公社党委办公室主任苏友余同志向我介绍。他说：公社从4月16日到5月16日一个月，仅早稻中耕、追肥和夏收等五项主要农活，革新了六种主要工具，已推广了一万二千多件，一般都发挥了效能。就是这些工具，在这一个月生产中，估计节省十八万多个劳动日。
