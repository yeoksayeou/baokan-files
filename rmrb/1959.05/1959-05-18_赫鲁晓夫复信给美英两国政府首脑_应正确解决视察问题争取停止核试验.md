Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 16th: The Soviet Embassy in Washington delivered to the US State Department on the 15th Khrushchev's reply to US President Eisenhower on the issue of stopping nuclear weapons tests. On the same day, the Soviet Embassy in London also delivered Khrushchev's reply to British Prime Minister Macmillan, with similar content, on the same issue to the British Foreign Office.

　　In his reply to Eisenhower, Khrushchev said that the Soviet government was satisfied with the US government's statement that it would not oppose the conclusion of a treaty stipulating the cessation of nuclear weapons testing in all forms (including in the air, underground, underwater, and at high altitude), and affirmed that reaching an agreement on this issue was the US objective. Khrushchev said that the Soviet government has always believed that this solution is fully in line with the task of blocking the path to the manufacture of new and more destructive nuclear weapons and eliminating the danger caused by atomic radiation generated by the explosion of such weapons.

　　Khrushchev said that the Soviet government also noted with satisfaction that the US government was willing to study the suggestion of predetermining the number of inspections to be carried out annually on the territory of the Soviet Union, in the United States and the United Kingdom proper, and on their territories, in order to inspect phenomena suspected of being nuclear explosions in any one country. The Soviet Union believes that this suggestion is a good basis for resolving the most difficult problem - the question of sending inspection teams to a country for on-site inspections. Agreement on this suggestion could open the way to the conclusion of an agreement on the cessation of all kinds of nuclear tests.

　　Khrushchev continued, the Soviet Union also believes that once an agreement has been reached on the number of inspections that observation teams will carry out in a country each year, there is no need to vote or reach a consensus on the issue of conducting inspections in a supervisory committee or other such body. For example, when the instruments at a monitoring post record something that gives reason to suspect that a phenomenon is a nuclear explosion, an inspection team can be dispatched at the request of any one of the three countries, the United States, the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom, within the agreed number of times. The Soviet Union is willing to undertake the obligation to guarantee the timely and unimpeded entry of the inspection team into the area within the Soviet Union where an explosion is suspected and where the relevant party expresses the wish to send an inspection team for inspection.

　　Khrushchev said that the Soviet Union noted the US government's view that the US does not want to stipulate that the number of inspections should be unlimited; and the Soviet Union also asks the US to note that the Soviet Union believes that the number of such inspections should not be very high.

　　Khrushchev requested that an agreement be reached on such a simple and obvious issue as the number of inspections in order to ensure that possible violations of the agreement can be detected.

　　Khrushchev said that Eisenhower suggested in his letter that concrete measures for detecting high-altitude explosions should be discussed in the near future. He expressed the Soviet Union's agreement to conduct technical discussions on the issue of stopping nuclear weapons tests in the short term, and to discuss concrete measures on methods of detecting high-altitude nuclear explosions on the basis of the resolutions of the Geneva Conference of Experts, in order to include these methods in the monitoring system.

　　Khrushchev concluded by saying that the Soviet government has always hoped to prohibit the testing of all kinds of nuclear weapons forever and universally. The Soviet Union is convinced that, based on the above considerations, it will be possible to find solutions to resolve differences between the countries concerned and to reach an agreement in the near future.

### 赫鲁晓夫复信给美英两国政府首脑  应正确解决视察问题争取停止核试验

    赫鲁晓夫复信给美英两国政府首脑
    应正确解决视察问题争取停止核试验
  新华社17日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科16日讯：苏联驻华盛顿大使馆15日向美国国务院送交了苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫就停止核武器试验问题给美国总统艾森豪威尔的复信。苏联驻伦敦大使馆同一天也向英国外交部送交了赫鲁晓夫就同一问题给英国首相麦克米伦的内容相似的复信。
    赫鲁晓夫在给艾森豪威尔的复信中说，苏联政府对美国政府下面的声明表示满意：美国政府将不反对缔结一项规定停止用各种方式
  （包括在空中、地下、水底和在高空）进行核武器试验的条约，并且断言就这个问题达成协议是美国的目的。赫鲁晓夫说，苏联政府过去和现在一直认为，正是这种解决办法才完全符合这样的任务：堵塞制造各种新的破坏力更大的核武器的道路，并且消除在爆炸这种武器时所产生的原子辐射所造成的危险。
    赫鲁晓夫说，苏联政府也满意地注意到，美国政府愿意研究这样的建议：预先规定每年在苏联的领土上、在美国和英国本土和它们的领地上进行视察的次数，以便视察在任何一国发生的被怀疑为核爆炸的现象。苏联认为，这个建议是解决最困难的问题——关于派遣视察小组到一个国家进行就地视察的问题的良好基础。就这个建议达成协议就可以开辟通向缔结关于停止各种核试验协定的道路。
    赫鲁晓夫接着说，苏联并且认为，只要就观察小组每年到一个国家进行视察的次数达成了协议，那就没有必要在监督委员会或其他什么机构中对进行视察的问题进行表决或取得一致。譬如在监督岗的仪器记录使人有理由怀疑某种现象是核爆炸的时候，可以根据美国、苏联和英国三国中的任何一国的请求，在一致同意的次数以内派出视察小组。苏联愿意承担义务，保证视察小组及时地和无阻碍地进入苏联境内被怀疑有爆炸现象而有关方面表示希望派出视察小组进行视察的地区。
    赫鲁晓夫说，苏联注意到美国政府这样的意见，就是美国并不想规定视察的次数是无限的；而苏联也请美国注意，苏联认为这种视察的次数不应当很多。
    赫鲁晓夫要求就视察次数这样一个简单而明显的问题达成协议，以保证得以发现对协议的可能破坏。
    赫鲁晓夫说，艾森豪威尔在给他的信里建议在最近期间讨论关于侦察高空爆炸的具体措施问题。他表示苏联同意在短期内就停止试验核武器问题进行技术性讨论，在日内瓦专家会议决议的基础上就发现高空核爆炸的方法讨论具体措施，以把这些方法列入监督制度。
    赫鲁晓夫最后说，苏联政府一向希望永远地和普遍地禁止试验各种核武器。苏联确信，根据上述的考虑，将能够找到解决办法，来解决有关国家之间的分歧，并且在最近期间达成协议。
