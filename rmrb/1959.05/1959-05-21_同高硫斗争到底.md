    Fight High Sulfur to the End
    The open-hearth and electric furnace combined steelmaking experience created by Daye Steel Plant is a new achievement in our steel front's struggle against high sulfur.
    Fighting against high sulfur is a constant task on the steel front. Every production link has a responsibility for this task. The steelmaking department certainly has a responsibility, and the ironmaking department also has a responsibility, and the coal preparation and coal washing processes have even more responsibility. To produce good steel, one should not simply rely on the last process of production—open-hearth furnace, converter, or electric furnace—to bear the burden, but more importantly, the first few processes of steel production should bear the burden. Because most of the sulfur content in steel comes from coal. To eradicate the scourge of sulfur, we must trace the root cause and start from the fundamentals, that is, we must start from doing a good job in coal washing and mineral processing. Only good coal can produce good coke, and only good coke and good ore can produce good iron. With good iron, we will have full confidence in making good steel.
    Grasping coal washing and coking is still an important link in the current steel production, and we must never think that with the experience of Daye Steel Plant, we can relax a little. Everything must be considered from the fundamentals. The experience of Daye Steel Plant is certainly very good, but it would be even better if we could eradicate the scourge of sulfur from the root.

    同高硫斗争到底
    大冶钢厂创造的平炉电炉混合炼钢的经验，是我们钢铁战线上跟高硫作斗争的一个新的成就。
    同高硫作斗争，是钢铁战线上的经常的任务。这个任务，每个生产环节有责任。炼钢部门固然有责任，炼铁部门也有责任，而选煤、洗煤等生产过程更有责任。要生产好钢，不应单纯依靠生产的最后一道工序——平炉、转炉或电炉来承担，更重要的是要由钢铁生产的前几道工序承担起来。因为钢铁的硫分大部分是从煤里带来的。要想根绝硫祸，必须逐本穷源从根本上着手，这就是说，要从做好洗煤和选矿工作开始。只有好煤才能炼出好焦，只有好焦和好矿石，才能炼出好铁。有了好铁，炼好钢就有充分把握了。
    抓紧洗煤、炼焦，仍是当前钢铁生产中的重要环节，绝不能认为有了大冶钢厂的经验，就可以稍有放松。一切事情都要从根本上着眼。大冶钢厂的经验固然很好，能从根本上杜绝硫祸就更好。
