Xinhua News Agency, Prague, May 6th: Czechoslovak President Novotný received the entire Chinese Military Friendship Delegation, headed by Vice Premier of the State Council and Minister of National Defense Marshal Peng Dehuai, this afternoon.

Present at the reception were Czechoslovak Prime Minister Široký, Vice Prime Minister and Minister of the Interior Barak, Minister of National Defense Lomský, and Chief of General Staff Rytíř. Also present was Chinese Ambassador to Czechoslovakia Cao Ying.

The two sides held cordial and friendly talks during the reception.

The same afternoon, Czechoslovak Minister of National Defense Lomský met with the Chinese Military Friendship Delegation.

That evening, Minister Lomský held a grand banquet to welcome the Chinese Military Friendship Delegation.

Those attending the banquet included Czechoslovak Prime Minister Široký, Vice Premiers Koběcký, Jankovcová, Barak, Chairman of the National Assembly Fierlinger, and Minister of Foreign Affairs David, among others. Ambassador Cao Ying and diplomatic envoys and military attachés from various countries also attended the banquet.

In his speech at the banquet, Minister Lomský said that the 650 million Chinese people, like the Czechoslovak people, are engaged in peaceful construction with great enthusiasm. However, Western imperialism is trying its best to wage a cold war, and American imperialism is rearming West German revanchism, which is the greatest danger to peace in Europe. Now, the Geneva Conference of Foreign Ministers from the East and West is about to be held, and this conference should help ease international tensions and eliminate the danger of war. To this end, Western countries must abandon their cold war policy.

Lomský also expressed his opposition to the conspiracy to create "two Chinas."

Marshal Peng Dehuai then spoke. He first praised the great achievements of the Czechoslovak people in socialist construction, and on behalf of all comrades of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, extended warm and fraternal greetings to all comrades of the Czechoslovak People's Army.

Peng Dehuai said that the general characteristic of the current international situation is that the East Wind has prevailed over the West Wind and will continue to prevail over the West Wind. The imperialist policies of aggression and expansion have suffered repeated failures. If the imperialist warmongers dare to provoke a new war of aggression, they will inevitably be resolutely counterattacked by the powerful socialist camp and the peace forces of the world, and will end in shameful defeat.

　　捷总统接见我军事代表团
    洛姆斯基部长举行盛大欢迎宴会
    新华社布拉格6日电　捷克斯洛伐克总统诺沃提尼今日下午接见了以国务院副总理兼国防部长彭德怀元帅为首的中国军事友好代表团全体成员。
    接见时在座的有：捷克斯洛伐克总理西罗基、副总理兼内务部长巴拉克、国防部长洛姆斯基、总参谋长里蒂尔。在座的还有中国驻捷克斯洛伐克大使曹瑛。
    接见时双方进行了亲切友好的谈话。
    同日下午，捷克斯洛伐克国防部长洛姆斯基会见了我国军事友好代表团。
    当天晚上，洛姆斯基部长举行盛大宴会，欢迎中国军事友好代表团。
    出席宴会的有捷克斯洛伐克总理西罗基、副总理柯别茨基、扬科夫卓娃、巴拉克、国民议会主席费林格、外交部长戴维等。曹瑛大使和各国外交使节和武官也出席了宴会。
    洛姆斯基部长在宴会上讲话说，六亿五千万的中国人民和捷克斯洛伐克人民一样，正在以巨大的热情进行和平建设。可是，西方帝国主义正在想尽办法来进行冷战，美帝国主义正在重新武装西德的复仇主义，这是对欧洲和平最大的危险。现在，东西方外长日内瓦会议就要召开了，这个会议应当有助于缓和国际紧张局势和消除战争危险。为此，西方国家必须放弃冷战政策。
    洛姆斯基还表示反对制造“两个中国”的阴谋。
    彭德怀元帅接着讲话。他首先赞扬了捷克斯洛伐克人民在社会主义建设方面的巨大成就，并且代表中国人民解放军全体同志向捷克斯洛伐克人民军的全体同志致以热烈的兄弟般的问候。
    彭德怀说，目前国际形势总的特点是东风已经压倒西风，并将继续压倒西风。帝国主义的侵略和扩张政策遭受节节的失败。假如帝国主义战争狂人们胆敢挑起新的侵略战争，那末，他们必将遭到强大的社会主义阵营和全世界和平力量的坚决反击，而归于可耻的失败。
