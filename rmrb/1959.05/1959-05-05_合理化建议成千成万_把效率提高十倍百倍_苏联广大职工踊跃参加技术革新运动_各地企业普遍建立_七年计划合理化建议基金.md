    The Soviet working class is demonstrating immense creative talent in the cause of communist construction. As they engage in the construction of the Seven-Year Plan, they are continuously developing their outstanding innovative spirit, improving tools, refining working methods, and inventing new machines and technical equipment, increasing their work efficiency tenfold, hundredfold, reducing costs, and saving large amounts of funds for the country. According to statistics, there are currently more than 1.7 million worker-inventors, technical innovators, and rationalization proposers in various industrial departments and state farms, machine repair stations, and other work sectors in the Soviet Union. This powerful technical innovation force submitted nearly three million rationalization proposals and technical innovation suggestions last year alone. More than two-thirds of these have been approved for implementation in production. The 1.8 million rationalization proposals that have already been implemented in production have saved the country more than 9 billion rubles.

    During the Seven-Year Plan technical innovation movement, the Moscow Rubber Factory put forward a new initiative. Inspired by the Seven-Year Plan, the workers of this factory proposed establishing a "Seven-Year Plan Rationalization Proposal Fund" in the factory to guarantee that 75 million rubles would be saved for the country through rationalization proposals within seven years. A quarter of the workers in this factory are rationalization proposers. In the past five years, they have put forward more than 15,000 rationalization proposals, saving the country 50 million rubles. Worker Ulyanov of this factory proposed 25 rationalization proposals in one instance last year.

    The Moscow Rubber Factory's initiative quickly spread throughout the country, and hundreds and thousands of factories put forward their own guarantees. For example, the "Lenin Forge" factory in Kiev proposed that the entire factory submit at least 9,000 rationalization proposals during the Seven-Year Plan, striving to save the country 30 million rubles. In addition, they also aimed to save the country 40,000 tons of steel, 300,000 tons of non-ferrous metals, and 1.6 million kilowatt-hours of electricity. Semininsky, a famous technical innovator at the "Red Excavator" factory in Kiev, guaranteed that he would submit at least 100 rationalization proposals before 1965, saving the country 500,000 rubles. His actions received a great response, and more than 100 workers in the Stalin Oblast of Ukraine responded to Semininsky's challenge.

    In order to further promote the rationalization proposal movement, social organizations such as the Party, the Communist Youth League, and trade unions in various parts of the Soviet Union provided great support and devised various new methods to mobilize workers to put forward more rationalization proposals. For example, the trade union organization in Ukraine recently organized a "Rationalization Proposal Month." During this month, all factories in Ukraine launched a movement to put forward more rationalization proposals. At the "New Kramatorsk" Machine Building Plant alone, 1,484 rationalization proposals were submitted in one month, of which 617 have already been implemented in production. Many other places also organized representative conferences of young rationalization proposers, and the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League also organized rationalization proposal competitions. The most outstanding rationalization proposers will receive bonuses for 1959. (Attached pictures)

They are steelmakers at the Zaporozhstal steel plant in Ukraine. In early April this year, they used the fast steelmaking method to produce five furnaces of steel in one day and night (compared to the past three furnaces). The steel production per square meter of furnace bottom area reached 16.92 tons. The steel production of this 185-ton open-hearth furnace reached such a figure, which is unprecedented in the history of world steelmaking. TASS draft (Xinhua News Agency issued)

    合理化建议成千成万　把效率提高十倍百倍
    苏联广大职工踊跃参加技术革新运动
    各地企业普遍建立“七年计划合理化建议基金”
    本报莫斯科4日电　苏联的工人阶级，在共产主义建设事业中表现出巨大的创造才能。他们在从事七年计划建设事业的时候，不断发挥自己卓越的创造精神，改良工具，改善工作方法，并且发明新的机器和新的技术设备，十倍、百倍地提高自己的工作效率，降低成本，为国家节省大批资金。据统计，目前在苏联各工业部门和国营农场及机器修理站等工作部门，一共有一百七十多万工人发明家、技术革新家和合理化建议者。这样一个强大的技术革新队伍，在去年一年内提出了将近三百万条合理化建议和技术革新建议，其中有三分之二以上已决定在生产中实现，已经在生产中贯彻的一百八十万条合理化建议，为国家节省了九十多亿卢布资金。
    在七年计划技术革新运动中，莫斯科的橡胶工厂提出了一项新的倡议。这个工厂的工人在七年计划的鼓舞下，提出了在工厂中建立“七年计划合理化建议基金”的倡议，保证在七年内用合理化建议的方法为国家节省七千五百万卢布的资金。这个工厂的工人有四分之一是合理化建议者，他们在过去五年内一共提出了一万五千多条合理化建议，为国家节省了五千万卢布资金。这个工厂的工人乌里扬诺夫去年一次就提出了二十五条合理化建议。
    莫斯科橡胶工厂的倡议很快地普及了全国，成百上千的工厂纷纷提出了自己的保证。例如，基辅的“列宁锻炼”工厂就提出了要在七年计划内全厂至少提出九千条合理化建议，争取为国家节省三千万卢布资金，除此以外，还要为国家节省四千万吨钢铁、三十万吨有色金属和一百六十万度电力。基辅“红色掘土机”工厂的著名技术革新者谢明斯基提出保证，要在1965年以前至少提出一百条合理化建议，为国家节省五十万卢布资金。他的这个行动获得了很大的反应，仅只在乌克兰斯大林州就有一百多工人向谢明斯基应战。
    为了进一步推动合理化建议运动，苏联各地党、团、工会等社会组织都给予了巨大支持并且想出各种各样新的办法来动员工人多提合理化建议。例如，乌克兰的工会组织不久前就曾组织过一次“合理化建议月”，在这个月内，乌克兰所有的工厂都展开了多提合理化建议的运动，只在“新科拉马托尔斯基”机器制造厂，一月内就提出了一千四百八十四条合理化建议，其中六百一十七条已经在生产中实现。其他许多地方还组织了青年合理化建议者代表会议，共青团中央也组织了合理化建议的竞赛，最优秀的合理化建议者将得到1959年度的奖金。（附图片）
