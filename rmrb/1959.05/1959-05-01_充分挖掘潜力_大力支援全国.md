Comrades, representatives of the presidium:

I fully agree with and support the reports made by Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen at this meeting. I firmly support the policies and measures taken by the State Council to quell the rebellion in Tibet and safeguard the unity of the motherland and the solidarity of nationalities. The counter-revolutionary rebellion launched by the reactionary upper strata clique in Tibet, in collusion with British imperialists and Indian expansionists, has been thoroughly crushed. This is another major victory for the people of all nationalities in our country and the Party's policy on nationalities.

Now, I will give the conference a brief report on the industrial situation in Harbin.

Harbin is a newly emerging industrial city in the northernmost part of the motherland, a transportation hub in northern Manchuria, and the political, economic, and cultural center of Heilongjiang Province.

Harbin was one of the first cities in our country to be liberated. Before liberation, it was only a consumer city mainly producing oil, wine, rice, flour, and small machinery repairs. At that time, among the city's more than 11,200 industrial and commercial households, only 1,400 were industrial, accounting for only 12.7 percent; there were only two factories with more than 1,000 people, and the city's industrial fixed assets were less than half of those of a large factory in the city now. At that time, cultural and educational undertakings were also very backward. There were only about 1,000 college students in the city, which was fewer than the professors, lecturers, and teaching assistants in one university now. The broad masses of working people were deprived of the right to education. The people's lives were very poor. Before liberation, some people called Harbin the "Little Paris" of the East. This was only because the city was filled with the barbaric looting and plunder of imperialism and feudal warlords, the brutal oppression and exploitation of foreign capitalists and comprador bourgeoisie, and the so-called "prosperity" created by this, which was solely for the speculation and corruption of those rulers and exploiters. Behind this so-called "prosperity," there was hunger, pain, terror, and struggle among the broad masses of working people.

Since liberation, under the wise leadership of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao and the correct leadership of the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, Harbin has undergone earth-shaking changes. After the large-scale economic construction during the First Five-Year Plan, it has developed into a comprehensive industrial city characterized by mechanical and electrical industries. It has developed from a consumer city into one of China's important industrial bases, and it is increasingly shouldering the glorious task of supporting the socialist construction of the whole country.

In recent years, Harbin's industrial development has been very rapid. Especially after the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the city's total industrial output value reached more than 2.89 billion yuan, more than double that of 1957 and 3.6 times that of 1952. Compared with the early days of liberation, it has increased 13 times. By the end of 1958, 53 projects above the quota limit had been completed in the city, and 13 of the 166 enterprises that the Soviet Union helped China build were located here. There are now 78 factories with more than 1,000 people, including 16 or 17 large factories with 5,000 to 10,000 people. Factories such as the Electric Machinery Plant, Boiler Plant, Steam Turbine Plant, Electricity Meter Instrument Plant, Measuring Tool and Cutting Tool Plant, Insulating Material Plant, Ball Bearing Plant, Electric Carbon Plant, Linen Plant, and many other modern and various types of factories are indispensable material foundations and important forces for our country's socialist construction.

After several years of efforts, especially the Great Leap Forward last year, Harbin is now able to manufacture 72,500-kilowatt hydraulic turbine generator sets, 50,000-kilowatt steam turbine generator sets, high-pressure boilers, high-speed high-temperature bearings, high-grade electric brushes and electric carbon, and various precision instruments and tools and other important products. All these products could not be produced in our country in the past. Now we can not only manufacture them ourselves, but also both the output and specifications are rapidly increasing and improving, and many products have approached or reached the world's advanced level. In the old China era, the largest generator manufactured in the whole country was only 200 kilowatts, but now the production of 25,000-kilowatt steam turbine generators is already considered a small model for the three major power plants in Harbin.

Harbin is not only an important industrial city, but also increasingly developing into a city with relatively developed science and culture. There are now 24 regular institutions of higher learning in the city, including Harbin University of Technology, Heilongjiang University, Harbin Medical University, Agricultural College, Forestry College, and Normal College, and 25 secondary vocational schools. Scientific research departments have developed to 34. Since the Great Leap Forward last year, more than 3,000 mass scientific research organizations have emerged. A comprehensive scientific research network including civil engineering, tools, instruments, welding, chemistry, veterinary medicine, agriculture, and forestry has begun to be established throughout the city. The number of people engaged in scientific research in the city has reached more than 3,000. This plays a great role in improving the level of science and technology, promoting the rapid development of industrial and agricultural production in the city, and supporting national socialist construction.

The reason why Harbin has been able to change the city's economic and cultural appearance in just a few years, and has achieved remarkable results in both developing production and improving the people's material and cultural life, is inseparable from the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, the correct leadership of the Provincial Party Committee, the encouragement of the general line of socialist construction, the strong support of the people of the whole country and brotherly regions, and the selfless assistance of Soviet experts. Many achievements in Harbin's industrial construction are the crystallization of the great friendship between the Chinese and Soviet peoples, and the result of mutual support and communist cooperation between the working class of the city and the entire working people and brotherly regions.

The rapid formation of Harbin as an industrial base is one of the important achievements of our country's First Five-Year Plan. According to the principle of "fully tapping potential and vigorously supporting the whole country," the people of the city have begun to play a certain role in supporting and promoting the national economic construction cause, especially in supporting and developing the national power industry. In recent years, the city has produced a complete set of 690,000 kilowatts of hydroelectric and thermal power equipment and 2.2 million sets of AC and DC motors, supplying the production needs of more than 4,000 factories and enterprises across the country. In 1958 alone, it produced 450,000 kilowatts of various power generation equipment, an increase of more than five times over 1957, accounting for more than 50 percent of the country's annual output. In recent years, the power generation equipment produced in Harbin has equipped large and medium-sized hydropower stations such as Guanting in Hebei, Dahuoqfang in Liaoning, Wulabo in Xinjiang, Huangtankou in Zhejiang, Gutian in Fujian, Liuxihe in Guangdong, Shizitan and Huilongzhai in Sichuan, Foziling and Meishan in Anhui, Liulangdong and Yilihe in Yunnan, and the Harbin Thermal Power Station. There is no doubt that the rapid development of China's power industry is of utmost importance in promoting the great leap forward in national industrial and agricultural production, especially in the arduous task of striving to achieve the four major targets of steel, coal, grain, and cotton.

This year, on the basis of the Great Leap Forward in 1958, Harbin will produce a complete set of 1.5 million kilowatts of power generation equipment, more than double that of last year, still accounting for about 50 percent of the national planned output. After these equipments are put into production, the annual power generation will reach 10 billion kilowatt-hours, equivalent to one-third of the country's power generation last year, and about three times the annual power consumption of Shanghai last year. The 72,500-kilowatt hydraulic turbine generator, which was recently rushed for the Xin'anjiang Power Station, is as high as five meters and weighs 630 tons, is the latest large-scale product in the history of China's power industry. Among the power generation equipment produced this year, the eight sets of rolling mill transmission equipment supplied to steel enterprises such as Wuhan Iron and Steel, Baotou Iron and Steel, and Beijng Iron and Steel alone can increase the country's rolling capacity by 7.2 million tons.

Next year, the annual output of power equipment in Harbin will increase by another 100% on the basis of this year's continued Great Leap Forward. It is estimated that by the end of the Second Five-Year Plan, the city's power generation equipment production capacity will be more than doubled compared to now, and the annual output will reach more than 5 million kilowatts. Along with the rapid development of national construction undertakings, China's power industry will inevitably see a brand-new situation that is gratifying and exhilarating. In a short period of no more than three years, Britain's power industry will inevitably be far behind by the pace of the Great Leap Forward of China's more than 600 million people.

In the Great Leap Forward year of 1958, Harbin also achieved an unprecedented "bumper harvest" in other industrial production. The characteristics of Harbin's industrial products supporting the whole country are: many new products, large output, and wide area. While vigorously promoting the development of the national power industry, Harbin's workers have rushed to manufacture complete sets of smelting equipment, precision electric meters and high-quality measuring tools and cutting tools and other industrial products with selfless labor to support national construction; In order to seize 10.7 million tons of steel, tens of thousands of workers fought day and night to rush to manufacture 160 converters, 34 electric furnaces, and 12 255-cubic-meter blast furnaces that we had never manufactured before. According to the design capacity, they can produce 1.1 million tons of steel and 1.3 million tons of iron annually. In addition, last year, more than 16 million sets of ball bearings were produced, an increase of more than five times compared with 1957, equivalent to one and a half times the national output in 1957; 380,000 electrical instruments, an increase of 2.6 times compared with 1957, equivalent to more than 50% of the national output in 1957, more than 5,000 tons of insulation materials, an increase of 1.6 times compared with 1957, accounting for about 70% of the national output in 1957. Among these products, more than 90% were supplied to all parts of the country. For example, transformers, measuring tools and cutting tools accounted for 91%; ball bearings and electrical instruments accounted for 92%; electric carbon, electric wires, and electric furnaces accounted for 95%; and six-ton converters and 255-cubic-meter blast furnaces were all supplied to steel enterprises in various places. The supported areas almost covered the whole country, reaching Yunnan and Guizhou in the south, Jiangsu and Zhejiang in the east, and Qinghai and Xinjiang in the west, and more than 20 provinces and cities. In addition, Harbin also produced a large number of more than 150 kinds of products such as electrical machinery, pharmaceutical chemicals, and daily necessities, which were also sold to more than 40 countries abroad.

The working class and the people of Harbin not only supported the construction of various parts of the motherland in terms of manpower and technology, but also created many useful experiences in accelerating the process of national industrialization and saving national construction funds. For example, Harbin Boiler and Steam Turbine factories, etc., by reforming product design, simplifying product structure, and reducing unnecessary parts and components, not only saved steel and electricity, shortened working hours, but also improved the use efficiency of products. Harbin Mechanical Federation, Qunli and other machinery factories, under the difficult conditions of no large factories, no large machine tools, no large cranes, no large steel casting equipment, and no engineers, created the experience of "building block type" and "clever ant" active machine tools, manufacturing a large number of mining, smelting, rolling equipment and other various heavy machinery for the country, with a total weight of about 10,000 tons. Harbin Jiancheng Machinery Factory, in cooperation with teachers and students of the Industrial University, successfully tested the new technology of electroslag welding by local methods, creating the experience of being able to manufacture large and heavy equipment even without large casting and forging equipment. Harbin Electric Machinery Factory successfully tested the new technology of arc cutting, finding a new way for high-strength metal cutting. In the construction industry, not only has the advanced experience of "three-dimensional cross-parallel assembly line operation" rapid construction been created, but also the "four noes" new technology experimental building built without steel bars, cement, wood, or red bricks has emerged, opening a new page in the history of Chinese architecture. All these have played a positive role in saving national construction funds, accelerating the process of national industrialization, and promoting the mass movement of technological revolution and technological innovation.

However, it must be pointed out that in recent years, through the state's key construction, although Harbin has begun to play an active role in supporting the national industrial construction, according to the requirements of the state and the expectations of the people of the whole country, we must make redoubled efforts. Harbin's today is indeed a world of difference compared with the poor yesterday of the old society, but compared with the great tomorrow, the real prosperity and development is only a beginning.

Like all parts of the country, 1959 will be a year of greater leap forward for Harbin. This year, Harbin is shouldering a more arduous and glorious task in the great cause of supporting the socialist construction of the whole country. We deeply know that China's 1959 national economic plan, centered on the four major targets of steel, coal, grain, and cotton, is a magnificent and grand blueprint for realizing a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward. According to the requirements of the national plan, Harbin will continue to produce a large number of important equipment for the country this year, including 1.5 million kilowatts of complete sets of power generation equipment, more than 4,000 tons of rolling equipment, 110,000 horsepower of irrigation and drainage equipment, and a large number of locomotives, mining machinery, ball bearings, measuring tools and cutting tools, insulation materials, electric meters, electric carbon, electric wires, electric furnaces, and other important products. Among them, many products still account for a considerable proportion of the national total output. After these equipments and products are manufactured and put into production, they will play a major role in achieving the four major targets in this year's national economic plan.

In order to ensure the victorious completion of the above-mentioned key equipment and products, Harbin is also shouldering a more arduous basic construction task this year. The total investment in basic construction in the city this year, only the part of the central direct enterprises, reached more than 300 million yuan, an increase of about 70% compared with 1958. There are more than a dozen new and expanded national projects above the quota limit. The city's civil construction area is expected to reach more than 1.5 million square meters this year, an increase of about 50% compared with 1958. Industrial construction accounts for about 70% of the total construction area, most of which are national key projects and projects serving national key construction. It can be seen from this that whether from the perspective of the whole city or from the perspective of many factories and enterprises, Harbin is still in the process of producing while building, and the future industrial production capacity will have greater growth. After the new and expanded factories are put into production this year, Harbin will surely make greater contributions in the great cause of supporting the national socialist construction.

As mentioned above, the task undertaken by the Party organizations and the people of the whole city of Harbin in the great cause of socialist construction of the motherland is very glorious and arduous. But we have fully estimated that in the process of completing these tasks, we will inevitably encounter many problems and difficulties, such as insufficient raw materials, electricity, transportation capacity, and labor force, and the existing equipment capacity and technical conditions cannot meet the needs of production; in industrial production, there are still some shortcomings such as the quality of some products is not good enough, the production plan is not completed comprehensively enough, and the enterprise management level cannot fully adapt to the needs of rapid development of production. However, all these difficulties and shortcomings are generated in the development, especially in the Great Leap Forward. As long as we continue to implement the Party's general line of socialist construction, further strengthen the Party's leadership over industrial production and all aspects of work, and resolutely rely on the masses, they can be completely overcome.

In order to complete this year's industrial production tasks, starting this spring, we have universally launched the "Successful Start Month" and "Red First Quarter" competition in the city, and have achieved remarkable results. The broad masses of workers in the city, with soaring enthusiasm, overfulfilled the first quarter's industrial production plan by 12% ahead of schedule. The city's industrial output value increased by 1.3 times compared with the same period last year, approaching the sum of the city's industrial output value in the first half of last year. Judging from the situation in the first quarter of this year, it is entirely possible for Harbin's total industrial output value this year to leap forward from more than 2.89 billion yuan last year to about 5 billion yuan. Now, the red flag competition centered on vigorously engaging in technological revolution, technological innovation, and improving labor productivity is being widely and deeply carried out. The slogans such as "Striving for time, striving for initiative, ensuring quality, ensuring quantity, and ensuring safety," "Veterans going into battle, one top two; new recruits on the battlefield, two top three," "Striving to become red flag units and red flag hands," "Striving to participate in the National Congress of Advanced Collectives and Advanced Producers Representatives," and "Welcoming 'Eleventh' and dedicating gifts to the 10th anniversary of the National Day" have become the actual actions of the broad masses of workers in the city. New people and new deeds of innovating technology, creating miracles, and completing the national plan ahead of schedule and exceeding the quota are heard every day and are too numerous to mention.

In order to guarantee the victorious and comprehensive completion of the national plan, we must further implement the Party's general line of socialist construction, and continue to implement the principle of "fully tapping potential and vigorously supporting the whole country" instructed by the central government. We must make the greatest efforts to create various conditions, overcome all difficulties, and complete the manufacturing tasks of "six major equipments" and various key products on time, in complete sets, with guaranteed quality, and with guaranteed quantity. Adopt various methods to better play Harbin's due role in supporting national construction. As mentioned earlier, we do have some difficulties in completing this year's production tasks, but as Premier Zhou said in his report, Harbin also has many favorable conditions in achieving a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward this year. After the Great Leap Forward last year, we have a more solid economic and technical foundation; the city's working class has become stronger, and the ideological awareness and labor enthusiasm of the broad masses of working people have been further improved; from leaders to the masses, we have more abundant work experience and production experience, especially a set of experience in carrying out mass movements; at the same time, in completing this year's production tasks, we will inevitably receive strong support from the central government and the provincial party committee, as well as active help and cooperation from all parts of the country. As long as we give full play to the role of these favorable conditions, and under the ideological guidance of the principle of "the whole country is a chessboard", strengthen the Party's unified leadership over industrial production and all aspects of work, ensure both the key points and comprehensively arrange, further implement the Party's mass line, vigorously carry out technological innovation and technological revolution, vigorously carry out the movement of increasing production and practicing economy, do everything possible to tap potential, and constantly improve labor productivity, we will surely be able to victoriously complete the glorious tasks given to us by the Party and the state.

If there is anything inappropriate in the above speech, please correct me, representatives.

    充分挖掘潜力　大力支援全国
    任仲夷代表的发言主席、各位代表：
    我完全同意并拥护周恩来总理、李富春和李先念副总理和彭真副委员长在这次会议上所做的各项报告。坚决拥护国务院关于平定西藏叛乱，维护祖国统一和民族团结所采取的各项政策与措施。西藏上层反动集团，勾结英帝国主义和印度扩张主义分子所发动的反革命叛乱，已被彻底粉碎，这是我国各族人民和党的民族政策的又一次重大胜利。
    现在我把哈尔滨市工业方面的一些情况，向大会做一个简要的汇报。
    哈尔滨是祖国最北方的一座新兴的工业城市，北满的交通枢纽，黑龙江省的政治、经济和文化中心。
    哈尔滨是我国解放最早的一个城市。解放以前，它只不过是一个主要生产油、酒、米、面和小型机械修配的消费城市。当时，在全市一万一千二百多户工商业中，工业仅有一千四百户，只占百分之十二点七；千人以上的工厂只有两个，全市的工业固定资产，还不及现在市内一个大型工厂的二分之一。那时候，文化教育事业也十分落后，全市大学生只有千把人，比现在一个大学里的教授、讲师和助教还要少，广大劳动人民被剥夺了受教育的权利。人民的生活十分贫苦。解放以前，有些人曾把哈尔滨称之为东方的“小巴黎”，这只不过是因为当时在这座城市里，充满了帝国主义和封建军阀的野蛮的抢劫和掠夺，外国资本家和买办资产阶级的残酷的压榨和剥削，以及由此而造成的专供那些统治者和剥削者们进行投机倒把，腐化享乐的一种所谓“繁荣”景象罢了。在这种所谓“繁荣”景象的后面，在广大劳动人民群众中，却充满了饥饿、痛苦、恐怖和斗争。
    解放以来，在中共中央和毛主席的英明领导和中共黑龙江省委的正确领导下，哈尔滨市发生了翻天复地的变化。经过第一个五年计划期间的大规模经济建设，它已经发展成为一个以机械电气工业为特色的综合性的工业城市；已经由一个消费城市，发展成为我国的重要工业基地之一；它日益担负着支援全国社会主义建设的光荣任务。
    几年来，哈尔滨市的工业发展是十分迅速的。特别是经过一九五八年的大跃进，全市工业总产值已达二十八亿九千余万元，比一九五七年翻了一番多，比一九五二年增长了三点六倍，如果和解放初期比较，竟增长了十三倍。到一九五八年末，全市限额以上的工程，已经建成五十三项，苏联帮我国建设的一百六十六项企业，在这里就有十三项。千人以上的工厂已有七十八个，其中并有十六、七个五千人到万人以上的大工厂。像电机厂、锅炉厂、汽轮机厂、电表仪器厂、量具刃具厂、绝缘材料厂、滚珠轴承厂、电碳厂、亚麻厂以及其它许多现代化的和各种类型的工厂，都是我国进行社会主义建设不可缺少的物质基础和重要力量。
    经过几年来的努力，特别是去年的大跃进，哈尔滨市现在已经能够自己制造七万二千五百瓩的水轮发电机组、五万瓩的汽轮发电机组、高压锅炉、高速高温轴承、高级的电刷和电炭，以及各种精密仪器和工具等重要产品。所有这些产品，都是我国过去从来不能生产的。现在我们不仅能够自己制造，而且无论在产量和规格方面，都在迅速地增长和提高，并且有不少产品已经接近或达到世界先进水平。在旧中国时代，全国制造的最大的发电机只有二百瓩，而现在生产两万五千瓩的汽轮发电机，对于哈尔滨市的三大动力厂说来，已经算是小型号的产品了。
    哈尔滨不仅是一个重要的工业城市，而且日益发展成为一个科学文化比较发达的城市。现在全市已有哈尔滨工业大学、黑龙江大学、哈尔滨医学院、农学院、林学院、师范学院等二十四所正规的高等学校，和二十五所中等专业学校。科学研究部门，已经发展到三十四处。自从去年大跃进以来，又出现了三千多个群众性的科学研究组织。在全市范围内，开始建立起一个包括土木建筑、工具、仪表、焊接、化学、兽医、农、林等综合性的科学研究网。全市从事科学研究的人员已达三千多人。这对于提高科学技术水平，推动全市工、农业生产的迅速发展，支援国家社会主义建设，起着很大的作用。
    哈尔滨市所以能够在短短的几年里，就改变了城市的经济和文化面貌，无论在发展生产，提高人民物质与文化生活方面都取得了显著的成绩，是和党中央、毛主席的英明领导，省委的正确领导，社会主义建设总路线的鼓舞，全国人民和各兄弟地区的大力支援，以及苏联专家的无私帮助分不开的。哈尔滨市工业建设上的很多成就是中苏两国人民伟大友谊的结晶，是全市工人阶级与全体劳动人民和各兄弟地区互相支援，进行共产主义协作的结果。
    哈尔滨市这座工业基地的迅速形成，是我们国家第一个五年计划的重要成就之一。全市人民，根据“充分挖掘潜力、大力支援全国”的方针，在支援和促进全国的经济建设事业中，已经开始发挥了一定的作用，特别是在支援和发展全国电力工业方面尤为显著。几年来，全市已经生产了全套的水力和火力发电设备六十九万瓩、交流与直流电动机二百二十万套，供应了全国各地四千多个工厂、企业的生产需要。仅一九五八年，就生产出各种发电设备四十五万瓩，比一九五七年增长五倍多，约占全国年产量百分之五十以上。几年来，哈尔滨所生产的发电设备，装备了河北官厅，辽宁大伙房，新疆乌拉泊，浙江黄坛口，福建古田，广东流溪河，四川狮子滩、回龙寨，安徽佛子岭、梅山、云南六郎洞、以礼河等大、中型水电站和哈尔滨热电站。毫无疑问，我国电力工业的迅速发展，对于促进全国工农业生产大跃进，特别是在力争实现钢、煤、粮、棉四大指标的艰巨任务中，具有极其重要的意义。
    今年，哈尔滨市将在一九五八年大跃进的基础上，生产全套发电设备一百五十万瓩，比去年增加两倍以上，仍占全国计划产量的百分之五十左右。这些设备投入生产后，年发电量将达一百亿度，相当于去年全国发电量的三分之一，约等于上海市去年全年用电量的三倍。最近为新安江发电站赶制的七万二千五百瓩的水轮发电机，高达五公尺，重达六百三十吨，更是我国电力工业史上大型的最新产品。在今年生产的发电设备中，仅供应武钢、包钢、北钢等钢铁企业的八套轧钢传动设备，即可为国家增加七百二十万吨的轧钢能力。
    明年，哈尔滨市动力设备的年产量，将在今年继续大跃进的基础上，再增长一倍。预计到第二个五年期末，全市发电设备的生产能力，比现在还要增长两倍以上，年产量将达五百多万瓩。伴随着全国各项建设事业的飞跃发展，我国的电力工业，也必将出现一个令人欢欣鼓舞，心花怒放的崭新局面。在不出三年的短暂时间里，英国的电力工业，必将被我国六亿多人民的大跃进的步伐，远远的抛在后面。
    在大跃进的一九五八年里，哈尔滨市其他各项工业生产，也都获得了空前大“丰收”。我市支援全国工业产品的特点是：新产品多、产量大、地区广。在大力促进国家电力工业发展的同时，哈尔滨市的职工曾以忘我的劳动，赶制了成套的冶炼设备、精密的电表仪器和优质的量具刃具等各种工业产品，支援了国家建设；为了夺取一零七零万吨钢，成千上万的职工，昼夜苦战，赶制了我们从来没有制造过的转炉一百六十座，电炉三十四座，二百五十五立方公尺的高炉十二座，按设计能力计算，可年产钢一百一十万吨，年产铁一百三十万吨。此外，去年还生产了滚珠轴承一千六百多万套，比一九五七年增长五倍多，等于一九五七年全国产量的一倍半；电气仪表三十八万只，比一九五七年增长二点六倍，相当于一九五七年全国产量的百分之五十以上，绝缘材料五千余吨，比一九五七年增长一点六倍，约占全国一九五七年产量的百分之七十左右。在这些产品中，支援全国各地的均达百分之九十以上。如变压器、量具刃具占百分之九十一；滚珠轴承、电气仪表占百分之九十二；电炭、电线、电炉占百分之九十五；六吨转炉和二百五十五立方公尺的高炉，则全部供应了各地钢铁企业。支援的地区几乎遍及全国，南达云南、贵州，东至江苏、浙江，西至青海、新疆等二十多个省、市。此外，哈尔滨市还生产了大批的电气机械、医药化学和生活用品等一百五十多种产品，还行销国外四十多个国家。
    哈尔滨的工人阶级和全市人民，不仅在人力和技术方面支援了祖国各地的建设，而且在加速国家工业化的进程，节约国家建设资金方面，也创造了许多有益的经验。如：哈尔滨锅炉和汽轮机等工厂，经过改革产品设计，简化产品结构，减少不必要的部件和零件，不仅节约了钢材和电力，缩短了工时，并且提高了产品的使用效能。哈尔滨机联、群力等机械厂，在一无大厂房，二无大机床，三无大吊车，四无大铸钢设备，五无工程师的困难条件下，创造了“积木式”、“巧蚂蚁”活动机床的经验，为国家制造出大批的矿山、冶炼、轧钢设备和其他各种重型机械，总重量约达一万多吨。哈尔滨建成机械厂，在工业大学师生的配合下，土法电渣焊新技术试验成功，创造了在没有大型铸、锻设备的条件下，也能够制造大型和重型设备的经验。哈尔滨电机厂试验成功了电弧切割的新技术，为高强度金属切割找到了新途径。在建筑企业方面，不仅创造了“立体交叉平行流水作业”快速施工的先进经验，而且还出现了不用钢筋、不用水泥、不用木材、不用红砖建筑起来的“四不用”新技术试验楼，在我国建筑史上开辟了新的一页。所有这些，无论在节约国家建设资金，加速国家工业化的进程，推动技术革命和技术革新的群众运动等方面，都起了积极的作用。
    但是必须指出，几年来，经过国家的重点建设，哈尔滨虽然开始发挥了支援全国工业建设的积极作用，但是按照国家的要求和全国人民的期望来看，我们还必须进行加倍的努力。哈尔滨市的今天，比起旧社会的穷困的昨天，确实有了翻天复地的变化，可是比起伟大的明天，真正的繁荣和发展，只不过是一个开始。
    像全国各地一样，一九五九年将是哈尔滨市取得更大跃进的一年。今年哈尔滨市在支援全国社会主义建设的伟大事业中，担负着更加艰巨而光荣的任务，我们深深地知道，以钢、煤、粮、棉四大指标为中心的我国一九五九年国民经济计划，是实现更大、更好、更全面跃进的一幅宏伟、壮阔的蓝图。根据国家计划的要求，哈尔滨市今年将继续为国家生产大量的重要设备。其中包括一百五十万瓩成套的发电设备，四千多吨轧钢设备，十一万马力排灌设备，以及大批的机车车辆、矿山机械、滚珠轴承、量具刃具、绝缘材料、电表仪器、电炭、电线、电炉以及其他各种重要产品。其中有很多产品，在全国总产量中，仍然占有相当大的比重。这些设备和产品制成和投入生产以后，对实现今年国家经济计划中的四大指标，将起着重大的作用。
    为了保证上述各项重点设备和产品的胜利完成，哈尔滨市今年还担负着更加繁重的基本建设任务。全市今年基本建设总投资，仅中央直属企业部分即达三亿多元，约比一九五八年增长百分之七十，新建和扩建的国家限额以上的工程，共有十几项。今年全市土建面积预计可达一百五十多万平方公尺，约比一九五八年增长百分之五十左右。在全部建筑面积中，工业建筑约占百分之七十左右，其中绝大部分都是国家重点工程和为国家重点建设服务的项目，由此可见，无论从全市来看和从许多工厂企业来看，哈尔滨市现在仍然处于边生产边建设的过程，今后的工业生产能力，还会有更大的增长。今年新建和扩建的工厂陆续投入生产后，哈尔滨在支援国家社会主义建设的伟大事业中，必将做出更多的贡献。
    如上所述，哈尔滨市的党组织和全市人民，在祖国社会主义建设的伟大事业中所担负的任务是十分光荣和艰巨的。但是我们已经充分地估计到，在完成这些任务的过程中，必然要碰到许多问题和困难，如原材料、电力、运输力、劳动力不足，现有设备能力和技术条件还不能满足生产的需要；在工业生产方面，也还存在着有些产品的质量不够好，生产计划完成的不够全面，企业管理水平还不能完全适应生产迅速发展的需要等等缺点。但是，所有这些困难和缺点，都是在发展中特别是大跃进中产生的，只要我们继续贯彻执行党的社会主义建设总路线，进一步加强党对工业生产和各方面工作的领导，坚决依靠群众，是完全可以克服的。
    为了完成今年工业生产任务，今春开始，我们就在全市范围内，普遍开展了“胜利开端月”和“首季满堂红”竞赛运动，并且已经取得显著的成绩。全市广大职工，以冲天的干劲，超额百分之十二，提前完成了首季工业生产计划。全市工业产值比去年同期增长了一点三倍，接近去年上半年全市工业产值的总和。从今年第一季度的情况来看，哈尔滨市今年的工业总产值由去年的二十八亿九千余万元，再跃进到五十亿元左右，是完全可能的。现在，以大闹技术革命、技术革新和提高劳动生产率为中心的红旗竞赛运动，正在广泛深入地开展起来。“争时间，争主动，保质保量保安全”、“老将出马，一个顶俩；新兵上阵，两个顶三”，“争当红旗单位和红旗手”、“争取参加全国先进集体和先进生产者代表大会”，“迎接十一，向国庆十周年献礼”等口号，已经成为全市广大职工的实际行动。革新技术，创造奇迹，提前和超额完成国家计划的新人新事，日有所闻，不胜枚举。
    为了保证胜利地和全面地完成国家计划，我们一定要进一步贯彻党的社会主义建设总路线，继续贯彻中央指示我们的“充分挖掘潜力，大力支援全国”的方针。我们要以最大的努力，创造各种条件，战胜一切困难，按时、按套、保质、保量地完成“六大设备”和各项重点产品的制造任务。采取各种办法，更好地发挥哈尔滨市在支援国家建设中的应有作用。如前所说，我们在完成今年的生产任务中的确存在着一些困难，但是正像周总理在报告中所说的一样。哈尔滨在实现今年更大更好更全面的跃进中，也具有很多有利条件。经过去年的大跃进，我们有了更加雄厚的经济和技术基础；全市的工人阶级队伍更加壮大，广大劳动人民的思想觉悟和劳动热情更加提高；从领导到群众，有了更加丰富的工作经验和生产经验，特别是有了一套大搞群众运动的经验；同时，在完成今年的生产任务中，我们必然还要得到中央和省委的大力支持以及全国各地的积极帮助与合作。只要我们充分发挥这些有利条件的作用，并且在“全国一盘棋”的方针的思想指导下，加强党对工业生产和各方面工作的统一领导，既要保证重点，又要全面安排；进一步贯彻党的群众路线，大力开展技术革新和技术革命，大力开展增产节约运动，千方百计地挖掘潜力，不断地提高劳动生产率，我们就一定能够胜利地完成党和国家所给予我们的光荣任务。
    以上发言是否有当，请各位代表指正。
