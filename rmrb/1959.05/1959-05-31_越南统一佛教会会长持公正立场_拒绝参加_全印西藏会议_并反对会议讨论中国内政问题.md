Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, May 30th: According to reports in local newspapers today: Reverend Thich Tri Do, President of the Vietnamese Unified Buddhist Church, replied on May 28th to Mr. Majumdar, Chairman of the Preparatory Committee of the so-called "All-India Tibet Conference," stating that he would not attend the "All-India Tibet Conference" to be held in Calcutta on May 30th and 31st because this conference would discuss the Tibet issue, which is China's internal affair.

Reverend Thich Tri Do said in his letter that, as a practitioner who believes in the Buddhist teachings of Sakyamuni, I hope for and welcome conferences that discuss Buddhism or are conducive to the peace and friendship of all nations. As for the Tibet issue, the Vietnamese Buddhist community believes that it is an internal affair of the People's Republic of China. The attempt by some foreigners to interfere with this violates the famous Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence advocated by Prime Minister Nehru and Premier Zhou Enlai.

    越南统一佛教会会长持公正立场
    拒绝参加“全印西藏会议”
    并反对会议讨论中国内政问题
    新华社河内30日电　据此间报纸今天报道：越南统一佛教会会长释智度法师28日复信给所谓“全印西藏会议”筹备委员会主席马朱达尔，表示不出席5月30日、31日在加尔各答举行的“全印西藏会议”，因为这个会议将讨论属于中国内政的西藏问题。
    释智度法师在信中说，作为信奉释迦牟尼佛教教旨的修行者，我希望并且欢迎举行讨论佛法或有利于各民族和平和友谊的会议。至于西藏问题，越南佛教界认为这是中华人民共和国的内政问题。某些外国人企图加以干涉，这违背了尼赫鲁总理和周恩来总理倡导的著名的和平共处五项原则。
