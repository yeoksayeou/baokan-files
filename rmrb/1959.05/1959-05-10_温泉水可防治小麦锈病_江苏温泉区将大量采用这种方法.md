Hot Spring Water Can Prevent and Control Wheat Rust Disease
    Jiangsu Hot Spring Areas Will Adopt This Method Extensively
    (Our Dispatch) The Xuzhou Special District Agricultural Science Research Institute of Jiangsu Province has achieved significant results in preventing and controlling wheat stem rust and leaf rust diseases using hot spring water from Ganyu County.
    According to tests, the germination rate of stem rust disease spores in hot spring water is 24.53%–27.81%, in 10% *Niaoeryan* water it is 24.67%, in 0.5 Baume degree lime-sulfur mixture it is zero, and in clean water it is 89.64%–91.76%. The germination rate of leaf rust disease spores in hot spring water is 28.43%, in 10% *Niaoeryan* water it is 30.41%, in 0.5 Baume degree lime-sulfur mixture it is zero, and in clean water it is 91%. Because hot spring water contains sulfur, it can prevent and control rust diseases, with a general effectiveness of up to 70%, second only to 0.5 Baume degree lime-sulfur mixture, and similar to 10% *Niaoeryan* water. Tests have also proven that spraying wheat seedlings with hot spring water has no adverse effects. Therefore, the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Agriculture has notified the entire province that areas with hot springs can extensively use hot spring water to prevent and control wheat rust diseases, and nearby areas should also find ways to introduce hot spring water for prevention and control. Where conditions permit, preliminary trials can also be carried out to accumulate spring water and allow it to evaporate, in order to increase the sulfur concentration, or mix it with indigenous pesticide solutions to improve the prevention and control effect.

    温泉水可防治小麦锈病
    江苏温泉区将大量采用这种方法
    本报讯　江苏省徐州专区农业科学研究所，利用赣榆县的温泉泉水防治小麦秆锈病和叶锈病有显著效果。
    据试验，秆锈病病菌胞子发芽率，在温泉泉水中为24.53％—27.81％，在10％猫儿眼水中为24.67％，在波美0.5度石硫合剂中为零，在清水中为89.64％—91.76％；叶锈病病菌胞子发芽率在温泉泉水中为28.43％，在10％猫儿眼水中为30.41％，在波美0.5度石硫合剂中为零，在清水中为91％。温泉泉水因含有硫磺，所以能够防治锈病，一般效果可达70％，仅次于波美0.5度的石硫合剂，与10％的猫儿眼水相似。试验还证明温泉泉水喷射麦苗，没有不良影响。因此，江苏省农业厅已通知全省，凡有温泉的地区，可以大量利用温泉泉水防治小麦锈病，附近地区亦应设法引进泉水，进行防治；有条件的地方还可以事前试行积蓄泉水，任其蒸发，以提高含硫浓度，或与土农药液混合使用，以提高防治效果。
