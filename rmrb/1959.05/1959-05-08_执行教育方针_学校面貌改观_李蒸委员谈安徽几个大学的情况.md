Chairman, fellow committee members:

During this trip to Anhui, I personally witnessed, as Premier Zhou stated in his Government Work Report, that "under the greatly strengthened leadership of the Party in education, we have, in accordance with the world outlook of the working class and the educational principles of socialism and communism, implemented the policy of education serving the politics of the working class and combining education with productive labor, thereby launching a tremendous and profound revolution in education." Due to time constraints, we only visited three universities and two middle schools, but we deeply felt that all levels of schools are vigorously engaged in the education revolution. The atmosphere of vigorous new life cannot be expressed in words. I can only admire and feel extremely excited! Now, regarding the teaching, production, and scientific research of Hefei University of Technology, Anhui University, and the Normal College in Wuhu, I fully recognize that our education work is moving in the correct direction of serving politics and serving production. The outlook of the schools has changed; they are schools, but also factories, farms, and scientific research institutions, and they have effectively and with focus implemented the "policy of taking teaching as the center and combining teaching, production, and scientific research." These schools have achieved remarkable results in a short period of time, especially in the second half of last year, such as: (1) The political and ideological awareness of teachers and students has greatly improved, forming a labor perspective and a collectivist perspective; (2) All majors can strive to connect theory with practice; (3) A large amount of scientific research work has been carried out, including many cutting-edge projects that have reached international standards; (4) Because schools have vigorously established factories and engaged in production, they have been able to promote industrial and agricultural production. The schools' factories are no longer the so-called "practice factories" of the past, but are actually "production factories," and their production plans have been incorporated into the national production plan; (5) Teachers and students working and studying together have greatly improved teacher-student relations, promoting mutual teaching and learning, equal interaction, and greatly improving teaching quality; (6) Students, because they often engage in labor, have strengthened their physical fitness and have shown excellent performance in sports. Briefly mentioning these most significant achievements already illustrates that the nature of our schools has completely changed.

Hefei University of Technology was rebuilt from the original Mining College in 1958, and the Mining College was expanded from the industrial vocational school established by the Huainan Coal Mine in 1950 in 1955. It is a newly established university after liberation, with a total history of only nine years, but now it is a new type of socialist university in our country, large in scale and well-equipped. In 1958, under the new situation of the Great Leap Forward in all aspects of the country, through the masses' liberation of thought and breaking of superstitions, 66 factories were established in just two weeks, and 884 new products were successfully trial-produced, of which 52 were of greater value and reached international standards. For example, second-year students majoring in mining electromechanical engineering trial-produced 40 kW motors; teachers and students in the geology department trial-produced basalt castings; teachers and students in the mining machinery department trial-produced oil-bearing bearings; technicians in the machinery manufacturing plant trial-produced precision measuring tools micrometers; teachers and students in the geology department extracted the semiconductor rare elements germanium and silicon; teaching assistants trial-produced direct blueprinting methods, and so on, all of which are achievements of great significance. These many inventions, technological innovations, and trial production of new products were all successful under extremely difficult conditions, after many struggles, including overcoming ideological resistance and material difficulties, so they are even more commendable. This is truly the fruit of victory that can only be achieved by people with a high degree of communist consciousness and revolutionary zeal, so it is even more worthy of learning.

Anhui University is a product of the Great Leap Forward in 1958 and has only been in existence for more than half a year, but it has already laid the initial foundation for a new type of communist university. I was even more excited after seeing this university because it is completely new and does not have the bad "traditions" of old universities. The most prominent impression is that this school has established a new ethos, which is: "the ethos of putting politics in command, the ethos of glorifying labor, the ethos of unity and fraternity, and the ethos of diligence and thrift"; in other words, the new ethos of the working class, the new ethos of communism, is already reflected in this school. We learned that the school's summary of the four main reasons why this new ethos can be established is worth introducing. These are: "1. From the beginning of our school's establishment, we received clear instructions from the Party Central Committee on the policy of 'education serving proletarian politics and combining education with productive labor,' so all our work has been able to move forward along the correct path. 2. The correct leadership of the Provincial Party Committee and its timely and specific assistance to our school's work. 3. The school Party Committee insisted on implementing and carrying out the Party's education policy and following the mass line in its work. 4. Under the leadership of the Party, all the students, teachers, and staff have demonstrated unparalleled revolutionary enthusiasm." We hurriedly visited this school and felt the greatest spiritual encouragement, which was also a profound socialist education.

Anhui Normal College is also a new type of university that has developed after liberation on the basis of receiving the old Anhui College. Although it is nominally an institution for training teachers, its achievements in teaching, production, and scientific research have proven that it has the scale of a comprehensive university. Like the two universities mentioned above, this college has achieved brilliant results due to the earnest implementation of the Party's education policy. Last year, in the second stage of implementing the work-study movement, after the vast majority of teachers and students broke superstitions and liberated their minds, under the slogan of "putting politics in command, starting from scratch, starting from small to large, combining indigenous and foreign methods, making the best of what we have, and running factories diligently and thriftily," they exerted their full efforts, broke through all difficulties, and launched a magnificent upsurge of vigorously running factories and making technological innovations. In just over 20 days, 34 factories were built, including iron smelting, steelmaking, machinery manufacturing, refractory brick, cement, bacterial fertilizer, pharmaceutical, paper making, and harmonium factories. More than 900 new products were trial-produced, many of which belonged to cutting-edge science, such as anhydrous aluminum trichloride, crystalline silicon, porous boron trioxide, and pure metallic lithium made by the chemistry department; track-marked tracer atom counters, microscopes, and microtomes made by the biology department; analog electronic computers, vertical beam interferometers, double-sided mirrors, particle counters, and silicon steel made by the physics department. Some of these are products that our country has not yet manufactured, and the quality of some products has reached international standards. The Xuan paper made by the Chinese department that we saw also reached export specifications.

I don't need to say more. The achievements already made by the three new types of universities mentioned above can deeply show the correctness and importance of the Party's policy of education serving proletarian politics and combining education with productive labor, and the reason why the three schools were able to achieve great achievements in a short period of time is that they were able to earnestly implement the education policy. In addition, I also deeply realized that strengthening the Party's leadership over schools is the key to all achievements. From the situation of the three schools I saw, I can infer that schools all over the country are making a great leap forward, which is closely coordinated with the great leap forward in national industrial and agricultural production. Regarding the question of how to better implement the Party's education policy, I plan to conduct further research. Based on the actual situation I saw this time, I have a preliminary understanding that to combine education well with politics and productive labor, the entire teaching process must be systematically and regularly arranged; the compilation and lecturing of textbooks must be closely integrated with the current political situation and the country's production tasks, as well as various activities inside and outside the school and inside and outside the classroom; every major course must strengthen its ideology, theory, and reality; in productive labor practice, in addition to applying the knowledge principles taught in the classroom, students must also learn a set of production methods, operating techniques, and consciously cultivate the excellent qualities of the working class; in terms of teaching methods, classroom teaching and on-site teaching must be closely coordinated. In these areas, detailed research and in-depth investigation are still needed. Under different specific situations and specific conditions, schools in various places may have different specific methods for implementing the education policy. Through a larger-scale investigation and research, a comprehensive, mature, and most suitable method for our country's current reality can definitely be found. I am prepared to work hard in this area, hoping to help self-transformation and improve my political and professional level in learning.

I was very fortunate to attend the National People's Congress this time and listened to Premier Zhou's Government Work Report and the reports of the two Vice Premiers Li on the national economic plan and budget and final accounts. In addition to wholeheartedly supporting them, I must also earnestly study them well. Regarding Vice Chairman Li Weihan's report on the work of the CPPCC, because I have worked in the CPPCC in the past, I feel that its enlightenment is even greater, so I express my complete agreement and support, and take it as a guide for future work and self-transformation.

Finally, I feel extremely indignant at the upper-level reactionary group in Tibet's betrayal of the motherland and the armed rebellion that disrupted the motherland's unity! I fully support the government's rapid suppression of the rebellion and its lenient policy towards Tibet. Tibet is Chinese territory, and the government's suppression of the rebellion of reactionary elements is China's internal affair. The interventionist elements of India and all imperialist elements who attempt to use the Tibetan rebellion to undermine Chinese unity and ethnic solidarity are doomed to shameful failure. Just as the country is making a great leap forward in all aspects, the people of Tibet, under the leadership of the Party and with the support of the people of the whole country, must transform the extremely backward serf society into a modern, prosperous, and happy new Tibet. The malicious wishes of all domestic and foreign reactionary groups and reactionary elements to undermine Chinese unity are daydreams. A strong China will never allow any ambitious people to interfere in its internal affairs.

　　执行教育方针　学校面貌改观
    李蒸委员谈安徽几个大学的情况主席、各位委员：
    我这次在安徽亲眼看到了如总理在政府工作报告中所说的“在党对教育工作的领导大大加强的条件下，我们按照工人阶级的世界观和社会主义、共产主义的教育原则，贯彻执行了教育为工人阶级的政治服务、教育和生产劳动相结合的方针，从而展开了教育事业的巨大的深刻的革命。”我们因为时间关系，虽仅看了三个大学和两个中学，但已深深地体会到各级学校都在大闹教育革命。一种蓬勃新生的气象是无法用文字表达的。我只有钦佩，感到无比兴奋！现在就我所看到的合肥工业大学、安徽大学和设在芜湖的师范学院的教学、生产和科学研究的情况来说，我充分地认识到我们的教育工作是在向为政治服务、为生产服务的正确方向迈进。学校的面貌改变了，它是学校，同时也是工厂、农场和科学研究机关，并且很好地、有重点地贯彻了“以教学为中心，实行教学、生产、科学研究相结合的方针。”这些学校在很短的时间内，特别在去年下半年，已经取得了显著的成绩，如：（1）师生的政治思想觉悟大大地提高，形成了劳动观点和集体主义观点；（2）各个专业都能尽量做到理论联系实际；（3）已经大量开展了科学研究工作，其中有不少是尖端的、达到了国际水平；（4）因为学校大办工厂、大搞生产，已经能够推动了工农业生产。学校的工厂不只是从前的所谓“实习工厂”，实际已经是“生产工厂”，生产计划已经纳入国家生产计划之中；（5）师生同劳动、同学习，大大改进了师生关系，教学相长，平等相处，大大提高了教学质量；（6）学生因为经常劳动，增强了体质，在体育运动方面有优良的成绩表现。略举这几点最显著的成就，已经说明我们的学校的性质完全改变了。
    合肥工业大学是在一九五八年就原来的矿业学院改建的，而矿业学院则是在一九五五年就原来淮南煤矿于一九五○年设立的工业专科学校扩建的，是解放后新设立的大学，总计历史不过九年，而现在已经是我国一所新型的社会主义大学了，规模宏大，设备齐全。在一九五八年全国各方面大跃进的新形势下，通过群众解放思想，破除迷信，在短短的两周内就办起来六十六个工厂，试制成功的新产品有八百八十四项之多，其中价值较大和达到国际水平的有五十二项。例如矿山机电专业二年级学生试制四十瓩电动机；地质系师生试制玄武岩铸件；矿山机械系师生试制含油轴承；机械制造厂技工试制精密量具分厘卡；地质系师生提炼半导体稀有元素锗、矽；教辅人员试制直接晒图法，等等都是具有重大意义的成就。这许多发明创造、技术革新和试制新产品，都是在极端艰苦的条件下，经过了许多斗争，包括克服思想上的阻力和物质上的困难才成功的，所以更是难能可贵。这实在是具有高度共产主义觉悟和革命的冲天干劲的人才能取得的胜利果实，所以更值得学习。
    安徽大学是一九五八年大跃进时期的产物，到现在才有半年多的历史，但亦已奠定了新型的共产主义大学的初步基础。我看了这个大学更感兴奋，因为它是完全新的，没有旧大学那些不良的“传统”。最突出的印象是，这个学校已经树立起一种新风气，就是：“政治挂帅之风，劳动光荣之风，团结友爱之风，勤俭朴素之风”；换句话说，就是工人阶级的新风气，共产主义的新风气，已经在这个学校里反映出来了。我们了解到这种新风气之所以能够树立起来，学校总结出来的四点主要原因是值得介绍的。这就是：“1、我校一开始建立，就得到党中央关于‘教育为无产阶级政治服务、教育与生产劳动结合’的方针的明确指示，因而各项工作得以遵循正确的道路向前发展。2、省委的正确领导和给予我校工作及时的具体帮助。3、校党委在工作中坚持执行和贯彻了党的教育方针和走群众路线。4、在党的领导下，全校同学、教师和职工发挥了无比的革命热情。”我们匆匆地看了这个学校，感受到一种精神上最大的鼓舞，也就是受了一次深刻的社会主义教育。
    安徽师范学院也是解放后，在接收旧安徽学院的基础上发展起来的一个新型的大学。虽然它在名义上是一个培养师资的学府，但它的教学、生产和科学研究的成绩已经证明是具有一个综合性的大学规模了。这个学院同上述两个大学一样，是由于认真地贯彻了党的教育方针而取得辉煌成绩的。去年在实行勤工俭学运动的第二阶段，绝大多数师生在破除了迷信，解放了思想以后，在“政治挂帅，白手起家，从小到大，土洋结合，因陋就简，勤俭办厂”的口号下，鼓足干劲，冲破一切困难，掀起一个波澜壮阔的大办工厂、大闹技术革新热潮。仅仅二十多天的时间即建成了炼铁、炼钢、机械制造、耐火砖、水泥、细菌肥料、制药、造纸、风琴等三十四个工厂，试制新产品九百多项，其中有不少新产品是属于科学尖端的，例如化学系制成的无水三氯化铝、晶体硅、多孔性三氧化硼、纯金属锂；生物系制成的记纹式示踪原子计数器、显微镜和切片机；物理系制成的模拟式电子计算机、垂直光束干涉仪、双面镜、粒子计算器和矽钢等，其中有的是目前我国尚未制造的产品，有的产品质量已经达到国际水平。我们看到的中文系制造的宣纸也达到了出口规格。
    我不须再多说了，只就以上约略介绍的三个新型大学已有的成就，就可以深深体会到党的教育为无产阶级政治服务、教育与生产劳动结合的方针的正确性和重要性，而三个学校之所以都能够在很短的时间内获得了巨大成就，就是都能认真地贯彻了教育方针。另外我也深深体会到，党加强对学校的领导，是一切成就的关键。由所看到的三个学校的情况，可以推知全国各地各处的学校都在大跃进，这与全国工农业生产大跃进是密切配合的。关于如何更好地贯彻党的教育方针问题，我打算再作进一步的研究。就这次看到的实际情况，我初步体会到，要教育工作很好地结合政治、结合生产劳动，必须把整个教学过程作一个有系统的、经常性的安排；教材的编写和讲授必须密切结合当前的政治形势和国家的生产任务以及校内外和教室内外的各种活动；每一专业课都必须加强思想性、理论性和现实性；在生产劳动实践中，除把在课堂讲的知识原则加以应用外，还要学会一套生产方法，操作技术，并有意识地培养学生具备工人阶级的优良品质；在教学方法方面，课堂教学和现场教学必须密切配合。在这些方面，都还需要进行细致的研究和深入的考察。在不同的具体情况和具体条件下，各地学校可能有不同的贯彻教育方针的具体办法。经过较大范围地调查研究，定能找出一套全面的、成熟的、最切合我国当前实际的方式方法。我准备在这方面努力工作，以期在学习中对于自我改造和提高政治和业务水平有所帮助。
    我这次非常幸运的列席人大会议，听了周总理的政府工作报告和两位李副总理的国家经济计划和预、决算的报告，除竭诚拥护外，还要认真地好好学习。对李维汉副主席的政协工作报告，我因为过去在政协工作，更感觉它的启发性很大，所以表示完全同意和拥护，并且作为今后工作和自我改造的指针。
    最后，我对西藏上层反动集团的背叛祖国，破坏祖国统一的武装叛乱，感到无比的愤慨！我对政府迅速平定叛乱和对西藏的宽大政策完全拥护。西藏是中国的领土，政府平定反动分子的叛乱是中国的内政，印度干涉主义分子和一切帝国主义分子，妄图利用西藏叛乱破坏中国统一和民族团结的罪恶活动，必定遭到可耻的失败。正当全国各方面大跃进的时候，西藏人民，在党的领导和全国人民的支援下，一定要把极端落后的农奴社会改造成为现代繁荣幸福的新西藏，所有国内外反动集团和反动分子们破坏中国统一的恶毒愿望都是在白昼作梦。强大的中国决不容许任何野心家干涉它的内政。
