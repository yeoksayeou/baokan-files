Xinhua News Agency, Yakeshi, May 30th. The Greater Khingan Mountains forest area, which relies heavily on vegetable supplies from other regions, is striving for self-sufficiency in vegetables this year. Various forestry bureaus and forest farms have already established more than seventy large and medium-sized vegetable farms. Thirty-seven people's communes have designated vegetable farming areas. Government agencies, schools, and employees' families are also utilizing nearby open spaces to cultivate numerous small vegetable plots. Currently, people are busy planting potatoes, spinach, onions, garlic, and other vegetables. By May 28th, more than 8,300 mu had been planted.

In the past, forestry enterprises in the Greater Khingan Mountains forest area were unwilling to grow vegetables, believing it was a matter for agricultural areas, so they mainly relied on supplies from other regions. However, the development and construction of the forest area has progressed rapidly, and the population has increased quickly. Supplying vegetables from other regions always lags behind demand. At the same time, transporting vegetables over long distances consumes a lot of transportation capacity, and many rot by the time they reach the forest area, making them expensive and not fresh. In light of this situation, the leading departments of the forest area decided to take the path of self-reliance. Since the beginning of the year, they have mobilized the masses to prepare for large-scale vegetable planting. Leading cadres, employees, and the masses in the forest area have been very enthusiastic about growing vegetables. They braved the severe cold to engage in large-scale fertilizer accumulation before and after the Spring Festival, and have now accumulated more than 350 million jin of fertilizer. After the vegetable acreage expanded, they encountered difficulties due to a shortage of seeds. People from various rural areas in the forest area wrote letters to their hometowns and obtained many vegetable seeds.

### 大兴安岭林区种菜忙

    大兴安岭林区种菜忙
    新华社牙克石30日电　依靠外地大量供应蔬菜的大兴安岭林区，今年力争蔬菜大部分自给。各林业局和各林场已经办起大中型蔬菜农场七十多个。有三十七个人民公社划出了蔬菜作业区。各机关、学校和职工家属也利用附近空地开垦不少小菜田。目前，人们正在忙着种植土豆、菠菜、葱、蒜等蔬菜。到5月28日止已种了八千三百多亩。
    过去，大兴安岭林区林业企业不愿种菜，认为这是农业区的事，所以主要依靠外地供应。但是林区开发建设进展迅速，人口增加很快，从外地供应蔬菜总是跟不上需要，同时，长途运输蔬菜要消耗很多运输力量，运到林区还腐烂很多，又贵又不新鲜。根据这种情况，林区领导部门决定走自力更生的道路，从年初以来，就发动群众为大量种植蔬菜进行准备。林区各级领导干部、职工和群众种植蔬菜的干劲很足。春节前后就冒着严寒大搞积肥，现在已积肥三亿五千多万斤。蔬菜面积扩大以后，曾遇到了种子缺乏的困难，来自各地农村的林区人民，就向家乡写信，要来了不少菜籽。
