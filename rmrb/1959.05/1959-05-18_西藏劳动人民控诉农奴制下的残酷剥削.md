Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 17th. The broad masses of Tibetan laboring people have been actively accusing the painful lives under serfdom and have issued calls for democratic reform.

In Lhasa, some of the people formerly known as "untouchables" who have moved from tents into new houses have recently been discussing: "If reform can be implemented and land can be distributed, we can settle down and establish ourselves." In the countryside, some who were originally household slaves of bandit leaders are demanding the early implementation of democratic reform. Some have voluntarily left the homes of slave owners and gone to the Military Control Commission to request job placements. Among some patriotic upper-class individuals, some have also voluntarily written letters to the leaders of their affiliated territories, proposing that democratic reform be implemented first in their territories.

Farmers, who have suffered under the oppression of the serf system for generations, are even more eager to implement democratic reform. Tsering Wangden, a serf belonging to the Gadan Monastery in Deqing Zong, recently complained to the work team cadres that he has a debt from nine generations that has not been paid off, and by his generation, it has snowballed to 13,500 "ke" (each "ke" is approximately 25 "jin"). Such a debt is like a mountain pressing down on him. If reform is not implemented, his descendants will bear this debt for generations to come and will never be able to pay it off.

The masses in the Ningjing Zong and Yanjing Zong areas in the southern part of the Changdu region, as well as the broad masses in the northern Tibetan grasslands, have been asking the People's Liberation Army officers and soldiers to implement democratic reform. In Heihe City, more than 30 Tibetans who have suffered greatly from the reactionary great serf owners have poured out their suffering. A Tibetan named Zhandui said: "Every year, I have to pay the serf owner 15 'ke' of butter (equivalent to 105 silver dollars), and I have to pay another 32 silver dollars in other rents and taxes. Such heavy taxes have made my family live a life worse than animals for generations." He said: "There are countless families like ours in Tibet. We firmly demand the implementation of democratic reform." Some impoverished women in this city tearfully complained to the People's Liberation Army soldiers: Life is so difficult. If the Communist Party does not lead us to reform, we will not be able to survive!

Recently, Zhang Guohua and Zhou Renshan, deputy secretaries of the CPC Tibet Working Committee, as well as responsible persons from the Working Committee and some departments of the Tibet Military Region, visited poor farmers in Cai Zong and Dongga Zong. The farmers poured out their past suffering under the oppression and exploitation of the reactionary ruling class, and their urgent desire for democratic reform, to these responsible cadres. In Cai Village, which belongs to Cai Zong, there are fifty "Duichong" households (serfs similar to tenant farmers, some of whom also work as hired laborers or handicraft workers), and only one of them is not in debt, and that is because he is old and too poor to borrow money at all. Twenty of the fifty Duichong households have no land at all. Yangji, a woman in her forties, complained to Zhang Guohua that her family borrowed 150 taels of Tibetan silver from the temple, and paid 30 taels of interest every year. Her father is now over seventy years old, and he can't remember how many years he has paid interest. The interest paid has exceeded the principal by many times. A farmer named Zhaxi in this village told the visitors that some creditors forced borrowers to pay high deposits, some of which were for property, some for green crops, and some even used people as collateral. His mother-in-law was pawned to the creditor as a house slave. After his mother-in-law died, his wife continued to work as a house slave at the creditor's house. Later, because he paid the creditor nine "ke" of grain every year, he was able to take his wife home to live with him; if he could not pay nine "ke" of grain, he had to immediately return to the creditor's house to continue working as a house slave.

Farmers who suffered heavy rent exploitation complained that they spent most of their time on the land every year, and at the end of the year, after repaying the seeds and paying the rent, they often only had a few bundles of hay left. Many farmers who rented land relied on collecting and selling cow dung to maintain a half-starved life, rather than relying on the grain harvested from the land as their source of livelihood. Cangji, a middle-aged woman in her thirties, told Zhang Guohua that she planted six "ke" of land last year, of which two "ke" of land yielded four "ke" of highland barley. As a result, after repaying two "ke" of seeds and paying two "ke" of land rent, she lost her labor in vain and still owed interest on the seeds. This year, with the help of the Military Control Commission, Cangji planted fifteen "ke" of land, of which the land belonging to the rebel elements has been declared by the Military Control Commission that whoever plants it will harvest it. She demanded the implementation of democratic reform and the abolition of usury exploitation.

In the manors of some bandit leaders, farmers suffered extremely cruel exploitation and persecution. The territory of the bandit leader and former Kalon Lhalu Tsewang Dorje spanned various parts of Shannan. Tens of thousands of serfs were exploited by him in his territory. Zhou Renshan led a group of cadres to Dongga Zong to visit Lhalu's serfs. The serf Banangxue told the visitors that he rented eight "ke" of land from Lhalu, but the serf owner demanded that he pay a heavy rent of eighty "cheng" (one "cheng" is fifty taels of Tibetan silver) of silver. However, the best harvest from eight "ke" of land could only yield grain worth seventy "cheng" of silver. He planted for six years, and as a result, he paid four hundred "cheng" of silver in land rent and still owed three hundred and eighty-five "cheng" of silver. After Banangxue calculated this exploitation account, he cried sadly in front of the visitors. He expressed that he could no longer endure this cruel exploitation.

In Lhalu's manor, his steward employed six "langsheng" (i.e., household slaves), who lived inhuman lives without any personal freedom. Some had been slaves since childhood and did not even know the names of their parents. Arong, who is forty-six years old, said that his family has been slaves in Lhalu's manor for three generations. His thirteen-year-old child, Quezhen, was born into the fate of a slave. His daughter's marriage also had to be approved by the master, and even after marriage, she was still a langsheng. Among Lhalu's six household slaves, one was a young and strong lad of twenty-one named Dawa, who was exchanged by the great serf owner's steward for an old household slave like cattle and horses. There was also a twenty-three-year-old female slave named Casi, who was also exchanged by the master for another household slave. Casi's parents were housed in the stable, and she herself was arbitrarily insulted by the steward's father and son. To this day, her three-year-old child does not know who the father is. None of the serfs in this manor does not hate Lhalu. They unanimously demand the immediate destruction of the man-eating serf system.

    西藏劳动人民控诉农奴制下的残酷剥削
    据新华社拉萨17日电　西藏广大劳动人民纷纷控诉在农奴制下的痛苦生活，发出了要求实行民主改革的呼声。
    在拉萨市，从帐篷里搬到新居的一些过去被人称为“贱民”的人，最近纷纷议论：“如果能够实行改革，分到土地，就可以安家立业了。”在农村中，一些原来是叛匪头子的家奴，都要求早日实行民主改革，有的自动走出了奴隶主的家门，到军管会请求介绍工作。在一些爱国的上层人士中，也有的自动写信给所属领地的领导机关负责人，提出首先在他的领地上实行民主改革。
    世世代代遭受农奴制度压迫的农民们，更迫切要求实行民主改革。德庆宗属于噶丹寺的差民次仁旺登，最近向工作队干部诉苦说，他有一笔九代的债务没有还清，到他这一辈已经利滚利滚到一万三千五百克（每克约合二十五斤）了。这样一笔债像大山一样地压在他的头上，如果不实行改革，他的子子孙孙都将背上这笔债，世世代代永远也还不清。
    昌都地区南部的宁静宗和盐井宗一带，以及藏北广大草原的群众纷纷向解放军官兵要求实行民主改革。在黑河市，有三十多个饱受反动的大农奴主摧残的藏民们倾诉了自己的痛苦。藏民占堆说：“我每年要缴给农奴主十五克酥油（折合一百零五块银元），还得交其他租税三十二块银元，这样苛重的差税，使我家祖祖辈辈过着牛马不如的生活。”他说：“像我们这样人家，在西藏不知有多少，我们坚决要求实行民主改革。”这个市有些一贫如洗的妇女向解放军战士悲切地诉苦说：艰难哪，共产党再不领导我们改革，日子就活不下去了！
    最近，中共西藏工委副书记张国华、周仁山以及工委和西藏军区一些部门的负责人，分别到蔡宗和东噶宗去访问当地贫苦农民，农民们纷纷向这些负责干部诉说过去在反动统治阶级压迫剥削下的苦难生活，和他们迫切要求民主改革的愿望。蔡宗所属的蔡村，有五十户“堆穷”（农奴中类似佃户的，也有做雇工或手工业者的），其中只有一户没有借债，而这一户是因为年老、太穷，他根本借不到债了。五十户堆穷中竟有二十户没有一点土地。四十多岁的妇女杨吉向张国华控诉说，她家从前借寺庙一百五十两藏银，每年还三十两利息，他父亲现在七十多岁，还了多少年的利息已经记不清了，付的利息已经超过了本钱不知多少倍。这个村的农民扎喜对访问者说，有些债主强迫借债人交纳高额的押金，其中有的押财产，有的押青苗，有的甚至用人押。他的岳母被押给债主当家奴，他岳母死后，他妻子又继续到债主家当家奴。后来由于他每年给债主交纳九克粮食，才能把妻子领回家过活；如果交不上九克粮食，便须立即回到债主家继续当家奴。
    受到重租剥削的农民们诉苦说，他们每年把大部时间用在土地上，到年终除了偿还种籽和交租以外，就往往只剩下几捆干草了。有许多租地种的农民，生活的来源却不是依靠从地里收来的粮食，而是依靠拾牛粪出卖来维持半饥半饱的生活。三十多岁的中年妇女仓吉对张国华说，她去年种了六克地，其中的两克地收获了四克青稞，结果除了偿还两克种籽和交纳两克地租以外，白白地赔上了工夫，还欠下了种籽的利息。仓吉今年得到军管会的帮助，种了十五克地，其中属于叛乱分子的土地，军管会已宣布谁种谁收。她要求实行民主改革，废除高利贷剥削。
    在一些叛匪头子的庄园里，农民们都遭受极端残酷的剥削和摧残。叛匪头子、卸任噶伦拉鲁·策汪多吉的领地遍布山南各地，在他的领地上，有成万的农奴受他剥削。周仁山率领一批干部到东噶宗访问了拉鲁的农奴。农奴巴囊雪对访问者说，他租种拉鲁八克地，农奴主竟要他交出八十秤（一秤是五十两藏银）银子的重租。而八克地最好的年景也只能收获价值七十秤银子的粮食。他种了六年，结果付出了四百秤银子的地租，还欠下了三百八十五秤银子的债。巴囊雪算了这笔剥削账以后，在访问者面前伤心地哭了起来。他表示无论如何不能再忍受这种残酷的剥削。
    在拉鲁的这个庄园里，他的管家使用了六个郎生（即家奴），这些郎生都过着非人的生活，没有一点人身自由。有的从小为奴，连自己父母的名字都不知道。四十六岁的阿龙说，他祖孙三代都在拉鲁的庄园里为奴，他的十三岁的孩子却贞，一生下来就是奴隶的命运，他的女儿出嫁也都要看主人的意思，而且出嫁以后也还是郎生。在拉鲁的六个家奴当中，有一个是二十一岁的年轻力壮的小伙子，名叫达瓦，是这个大农奴主的管家用了一个年老的家奴像牛马一样换来的。有一个二十三岁的女奴，名叫擦丝，也是被主人用另外的家奴换来的。擦丝的父母被安置住在马棚里，她自己被管家的父子随意侮辱，至今她的三岁的孩子不知是谁生的。这个庄园的农奴没有不痛恨拉鲁的，他们一致要求赶快摧毁吃人的农奴制度。（附图片）
    西藏山南地区泽当附近的藏民开始播种，解放军战士也参加了春耕播种活动。               尹　锐摄（新华社稿）
