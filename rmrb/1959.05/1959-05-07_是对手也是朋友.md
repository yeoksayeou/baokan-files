Both Opponents and Friends

In socialist labor competitions, the competing parties are both opponents and friends. In the process of competition, they encourage each other, and the result of the competition is common progress.

Pingyang and Huangyan have similar natural conditions, but their past levels of production development differed greatly. In 1957, the per-unit area yield of grain in the two counties differed by more than 100 jin. Last year, the two counties launched a competition, chasing each other and persevering. In particular, the people of Pingyang worked hard to catch up with Huangyan. As a result, both counties made common progress, and grain production nearly doubled.

The purpose of our competition is not for you to overwhelm me or me to overwhelm you, but for common progress and universal upsurge. Therefore, the content of the competition is to learn from each other, exchange experiences, promote each other, move forward hand in hand, and support each other with close collaboration; rather than mutually excluding each other, fighting over things; nor is it to be mutually sealed off, keeping things secret. The communist style of Pingyang and Huangyan helping each other in their paired competition is worth greatly promoting.

This newspaper reported continuously on the paired competition between Huangyan and Pingyang last year. We wish Pingyang and Huangyan greater success in this year's competition, and we also hope that similar competitions will arise in more places.

### 是对手也是朋友

　　是对手也是朋友
    在社会主义劳动竞赛中，竞赛的双方是对手也是朋友。在竞赛的过程中是互相激励，竞赛的结果是共同跃进。
    平阳和黄岩自然条件差不多，过去生产发展的水平却差得多。1957年两县粮食的单位面积产量相差一百多斤。去年，两县展开竞赛，你追我赶，坚持不懈。特别是平阳人民奋发图强，立志赶上黄岩。结果两县共同跃进，粮食产量都接近翻一番。
    我们竞赛的目的不是你压倒我、我压倒你，而是共同跃进、普遍高涨。因此，竞赛的内容是相互学习，交流经验；相互推动，携手前进；相互支援，密切协作；而不是相互排挤，你争我夺；也不是互相封锁，秘而不宣。平阳和黄岩挂钩竞赛中你帮我、我帮你的共产主义风格，是值得大大发扬的。
    黄岩和平阳挂钩竞赛，本报去年曾作了连续报道。我们预祝平阳、黄岩在今年的竞赛中获得更大的成果，也希望同样的竞赛在更多的地方兴起。
