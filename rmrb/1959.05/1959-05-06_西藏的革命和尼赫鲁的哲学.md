The rebellion launched by a few traitors in Tibet has been largely suppressed. The bloodshed caused by the rebels has stopped in most parts of Tibet as their shameful failure became apparent. Now, Tibet is facing a peaceful revolution, as indicated by the resolution of the National People's Congress, a democratic reform that the broad masses of the Tibetan people have long awaited and urgently demanded. This is a revolution, a continuation of the people's revolution that swept across mainland China before and after 1949. This revolution, which has been delayed for eight years since Tibet's peaceful liberation due to the obstruction of the former Tibetan local government, will now proceed peacefully, meaning without bloodshed. The Tibetan people will adopt a policy of compensation towards the upper-class elements in Tibet who did not participate in the rebellion, similar to the policy towards the national bourgeoisie in the Han areas. This is possible because behind the Tibetan people stands the support of hundreds of millions of people across China who have already completed democratic reforms and socialist transformation, providing ample conditions for this approach.

Currently, many countries around the world are discussing the Tibet issue, which is a great thing. The more than one million people on the roof of the world, who have never been seriously noticed before, have the right to enjoy this honor, allowing the world to pay attention to them, and for them to be educated and tempered in the world's discussions. Some foreigners say that the rebellion by a few reactionaries in Tibet is a "revolution," a "nationalist," "anti-imperialist," and "anti-colonialist" revolution, and they should be granted "complete" and "inviolable" autonomy or "independence"; while the suppression of the rebellion by the People's Liberation Army with the active support of the Tibetan people is "armed intervention," "aggression," "colonialism," and "imperialism," akin to "Hitler." Those who say this are Western imperialists and reactionaries from various countries, such as Asia's Kishi Nobusuke, Syngman Rhee, Sarit Thanarat, Ngo Dinh Diem, and Chiang Kai-shek (though he does not support Tibetan independence and instead demands Tibet's allegiance to Taiwan). There are also some bourgeois elements in certain capitalist countries whose general political stance differs from the aforementioned individuals, but on this issue, they stand with imperialism, such as certain bourgeois elements in India. All the aforementioned individuals are a minority in the world and also a minority in their own countries, but they control a considerable amount of propaganda machinery, making them appear quite arrogant for a time. More people in the world say that the rebellion in Tibet is reactionary and that suppressing the rebellion is just. The people of socialist countries unanimously support the Chinese people's struggle against the rebels. Even in the capitalist world, the majority stand with the Chinese people. They include the working people of various countries, those who advocate justice and progress, and the national bourgeoisie fighting against foreign aggression and intervention. These national bourgeoisie understand that supporting foreign intervention in Tibet is equivalent to supporting foreign intervention in the internal affairs of Indonesia, Ceylon, Cambodia, Nepal, Iraq, Cuba, and many countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, equivalent to violating these countries' sovereignty and territorial integrity. However, in some capitalist countries, the voices of justice are temporarily drowned out by the clamor of the anti-China propaganda machines. Some people feel sad: a good People's Republic of China, a good Sino-Indian friendship, if not for the Tibetan rebellion, wouldn't it be better! Their hearts are good, but they have not seen that the Tibetan rebellion, once it occurred and was swiftly suppressed, turned a bad thing into a good one. The revolution in Tibet was accelerated by this rebellion, and the democratization of Tibet will ultimately end the history of foreign intervention in Tibet, which is also completely necessary for the genuine consolidation of Sino-Indian friendship. In summary, regarding these various discussions, not only the Tibetan people and the people of the entire China should seriously study and learn from them, but many people in capitalist countries, especially those in capitalist countries who are loudly discussing the Tibet issue, will also study and learn from them.

We would like to discuss Nehru's speech on April 27 in the Indian Parliament. (Editor's note: After writing this commentary, we read Nehru's speech on May 4 in the Indian Federal Parliament. The main points of this speech did not go beyond the scope of the April 27 speech. Therefore, we have made no changes or additions to it.)

Nehru has discussed the Tibet issue in the parliament from March 17 this year to the end of April, which is the seventh time. Nehru has repeatedly expressed sympathy for the so-called "autonomy aspirations of the Tibetan people" and opposed China's so-called "armed intervention." On April 27, his speech was more systematic. Our newspaper has already published the full text on April 30. For the convenience of the readers, we will quote a segment of his speech again. This segment can largely serve as a summary of his views on the Tibetan rebellion and India's role:

"The situation is undoubtedly difficult. On the one hand, there is a vibrant, rapidly advancing society; on the other hand, there is a stagnant, unchanging society that fears what actions might be taken against it in the name of reform. The gap between the two is large, and it seems difficult to find any common ground. Meanwhile, some form of change has inevitably come to Tibet. Transportation has rapidly developed, and Tibet's long-standing isolation has been partially broken. Although material obstacles have gradually been removed, psychological and emotional barriers have increased. Obviously, attempts to break through these psychological and emotional barriers have either not been made or have failed.

"If this is entirely the responsibility of certain 'upper-class reactionaries' in Tibet, it seems that this statement oversimplifies a complex situation. Even according to information from the Chinese side, the scale of the Tibetan riots is considerable, and the basis of this riot must be a strong nationalist sentiment that affects not only the upper class but also others. Undoubtedly, vested interest groups have participated in the riots and tried to benefit from them. Attempting to explain the situation with rather outdated words, phrases, and slogans is of little help.

"When news of these unpleasant developments reached India, it immediately provoked a strong and widespread reaction. This reaction was not initiated by the government. This reaction was also not essentially political. This reaction was mainly a sympathetic response based on emotion and humanitarian reasons. It was also based on the close feelings created by the long-standing religious and cultural ties with the Tibetan people. This is an instinctive reaction. Indeed, some people in India have tried to guide this reaction in the wrong direction and benefit from it. However, the reaction of the Indian people is a fact. If the reaction here is like this, then one can easily imagine how the reaction of the Tibetans themselves would be. Perhaps other Buddhist countries in Asia also have such reactions. When such a strong emotion that is not essentially political exists, it cannot be handled merely by political methods, let alone military methods. We have no intention of interfering in Tibet; we very much hope to maintain friendship between India and China; but at the same time, we have great sympathy for the Tibetan people, and we are very sorry for their difficult situation. We still hope that the Chinese authorities will adopt a wise attitude, not use their great power against the Tibetans, and, based on their own assurances of autonomy for the Tibetan region, strive for friendly cooperation. First, we hope that the current fighting and killing will stop."

Nehru's description of Tibet as a "stagnant, unchanging society that fears what actions might be taken against it in the name of reform" is indeed the starting point of the entire issue. Our discussion must begin here and can only begin here.

Tibet is a feudal serf society based on the manor system. In Tibet, the main means of production—all the land and most of the livestock—belong to three types of lords, that is, serf owners, namely, the government (feudal government), monasteries, and nobles. These three types of serf owners make up about 5% of Tibet's population of 1.2 million, or about 60,000 people. All peasants and most herdsmen do not have their own land and livestock and can only work for the serf owners. They, along with their children, are perpetually bound to different serf owners. The serf owners' estates include land specifically for the feudal government's corvée, which is allocated to serfs who have to perform various unpaid corvée for the feudal government. Military service is also performed by some of these serfs. The rest of the estates are the serf owners' so-called "self-cultivated land." On such estates, serfs have to plow all the land for the lord with their own oxen and tools (sometimes even bringing their own food) and only receive a small piece (about one-third of the lord's land) of poor land as compensation. Serfs spend most of their time each year working on the serf owners' land and performing various unpaid labor for the serf owners. On these two types of estates, more than 70% of the serfs' labor income becomes the serf owners' exploitation income. Serfs' income is generally insufficient to maintain life, so they have to borrow high-interest loans from the serf owners. A large number of serfs are unable to repay their debts, with some debts dating back hundreds of years. Serfs not only have no political rights but also lack ordinary freedom of movement; even short-term travel requires the lord's permission.

Tibetan nobles are hereditary. There are currently about 200-300 noble families in Tibet, with their status determined by the amount of property they own. The large nobles make up about one-tenth of the total number of nobles, or about 20 families, each with dozens of estates and thousands of serfs. The power of the Tibetan feudal government has always been in the hands of these large nobles. The boundary between nobles and serfs is strictly observed. Serfs must avoid or bow and stick out their tongues to show respect when they see a noble, and they must speak in a certain way, not allowed to make mistakes. Nobles can arbitrarily punish serfs who escape or are considered to have committed crimes, in addition to the most common whipping, there are also horrifying tortures such as gouging out eyes, cutting off noses, cutting off hands, cutting off tendons, and digging out knee bones.

Tibetan monasteries play an important role in social life. The legitimate religious activities of monasteries and the religious freedom of the people must be protected and respected at all times. However, the rulers of Tibetan monasteries, up to now, have all been serf owners. Monasteries' usury and commercial exploitation of serfs are even more severe than that of the government and nobles. Monasteries also have an additional layer of exploitation in the name of religion. Monasteries are also strictly hierarchical, and poor monks and junior monks of serf origin are also exploited within the monastery. Monasteries also have various torture instruments and prisons, where serfs and lower-ranking monks can be arbitrarily tortured, with the cruelty equal to that of other serf owners.

Generally speaking, nobles and monasteries each own about 30% of all the land in Tibet, with the remaining 40% belonging to the feudal government.

The political and religious center built on such a reactionary, dark, cruel, and barbaric serf system is, of course, a gathering of the largest serf owners. Among these largest serf owners, various terrible phenomena of corruption and internal struggles are inevitable. Around the Dalai Lama, some high-ranking officials who hold power have frequently killed each other and poisoned each other for power and profit. The Dalai Lama is not, as Nehru said, unconditionally revered by these people; on the contrary, these people often use the Dalai Lama as a puppet, imposing their will on him, and even poisoning the Dalai Lama to death when they deem it necessary. For example, it is known that in 1855, the 11th Dalai Lama died suddenly at the age of 18 in the Potala Palace; then, in 1875, the 12th Dalai Lama also died suddenly at the age of 20 in the Potala Palace. After the British imperialists invaded Tibet, the methods used by the upper-class reactionary rulers of Tibet to eliminate dissent became even more despicable and cruel. In 1923, the 9th Panchen Lama was forced to flee to the mainland for life; in 1947, the regent Reting Rinpoche, who had been in power for eight years, was arrested and strangled in prison; in the same year, the father of the current 14th Dalai Lama, who is now in Mussoorie, was poisoned to death by reactionary elements colluding with foreigners to better control the Dalai Lama because he had patriotic thoughts; in 1950, the Gedun Choepel, who worked for the peaceful liberation of Tibet, was poisoned and burned to ashes in Chamdo. These notorious crimes were all committed by the running dogs of foreign interveners in the Tibetan ruling clique.

This society was indeed stagnant in the past, not only economically backward and culturally backward, but also unable to reproduce its population. However, this society's system is in no way "mild" or "humane"! This system is a thoroughly backward, reactionary, cruel, and barbaric system!

We ask all those who loudly claim to be sympathizers of the "Tibetan people": who are the "Tibetan people" you sympathize with? Whose autonomy or "independence" are you advocating? Whose failure are you mourning for the defeat of the Tibetan rebellion? It seems that many of these so-called "sympathizers" are only pretending to be the Tibetan people, pretending to be Tibetan autonomy, pretending to be humanitarianism. They do not sympathize with the Tibetan people but with the Tibetan people's generations of oppressors, exploiters, and murderers, with the heads of the cannibalistic system in Tibet. When the big serf owners in Tibet gouge out the eyes and hearts of serfs, these sympathy experts do not see it as a tragedy and do not demand mildness and humanity from these serf owners. When these big serf owners attack the People's Liberation Army stationed on their own soil, and when they brutally kill captured soldiers of the People's Liberation Army and government officials, the sympathizers only cheer "well done" and advocate that these serf owners can conduct a hundred years of guerrilla warfare, without demanding mildness and humanity from them. But only when the People's Liberation Army, in response to the rebellion of these wolves, shifts from defense to offense, that is, only when this most cruel and barbaric serf system faces its final crisis due to the failure of the armed rebellion, all kinds of cries of tragedy, sympathy, humanity, autonomy, and independence, like a tide breaking through a dam, surge forth. From this, it can be seen that those who make such cries, apart from some who are mistaken, are fundamentally the guardians of the most reactionary serf system and the most barbaric big serf owners, fundamentally the enemies of the liberation of the Tibetan people. It is precisely because of this that this Metternich-style counter-revolutionary "Holy Alliance" can link the U.S. State Department, British colonialists, South Korean Syngman Rhee, South Vietnamese Ngo Dinh Diem, Chinese Chiang Kai-shek, and the reactionary parties in India, the Socialist Party, and the People's Alliance. What is strange about this?

We are surprised that Indian Prime Minister Nehru, on the one hand, obviously has important contradictions with many dirty characters in this alliance and understands the tricks they play that are detrimental to India, detrimental to Sino-Indian friendship, and detrimental to Nehru himself, but on the other hand, is involuntarily pushed by this alliance to an important position in their so-called "sympathy for Tibet" movement, allowing them to sit back and watch the fight, clapping their hands in delight. We are now forced to argue with Mr. Nehru in our commentary, which is a very sad thing for us. Mr. Nehru is the prime minister of our respected and friendly neighbor, India, and one of the world's influential politicians. For us, it is particularly unforgettable that he is a friend of China and an opponent of imperialist war policies and aggression. Moreover, he has made many enlightened statements about social progress. For example, in his "Autobiography" written in 1934-1935 while in prison, despite his many misunderstandings and prejudices about communism (he himself said he was a "typical bourgeois" with all the prejudices fostered in a bourgeois environment), he still acknowledged that "Marxist writers have made the most profound and insightful analysis of the changes taking place in the world today." He also said: "Economic interests form the political views of various groups and classes. Reason or moral views cannot go beyond these interests. An individual can be influenced and give up special rights, although this is rare, but classes and groups will not. Therefore, the attempt to influence a ruling privileged class to give up its power and privileges has always been unsuccessful and seems to have no reason to be successful in the future." Nehru is right here. However, in his speech on April 27, 1959, he sings a completely different tune! He either completely abandoned his previously expressed views or did not actually understand the Marxist scientific method that he once thought he understood. Now he blames us for not being able to influence the ruling class in Tibet to give up power and privileges, and tries to dismiss the class analysis of Tibetan society as "rather outdated words, phrases, and slogans," and describes the extremely opposed classes of serfs and serf owners as a single society that is "concerned about what actions might be taken against it in the name of reform"! Of course, Nehru's attempt is something we cannot agree with. The class antagonism in Tibetan society is a living fact, not a matter of words, phrases, or slogans, let alone outdated. Reform must take action and must benefit the vast majority who demand reform, only harming the small minority who firmly oppose reform. In the case of Tibet, reform is first of all to benefit the 95% of the population, 1.14 million people. The remaining 5% of the population, 60,000 people, also have various different situations. Only a small minority among them firmly oppose reform and even rebel and do not repent. We have already said that about 20,000 rebels are mostly deceived and coerced laborers (all counter-revolutionary armies are like this), and if we exclude about one-third of the Kham people, then the Tibetans who participated in the rebellion only account for a little more than 1% of Tibet's 1.2 million people. The idea that the entire Tibetan upper class has betrayed is incorrect. Moreover, among these 60,000 people, there is still a considerable number of enlightened individuals who support reform. Therefore, we must distinguish between different situations and appropriately deal with the upper class, which is our consistent policy. If it is said that all these different people are equally concerned about reform, equally have psychological and emotional barriers, that is not in line with reality. As for the vast majority who demand reform, what do they have to be concerned about, what psychological and emotional barriers do they have?

When discussing Tibetan society, although Nehru does not oppose reform and does not deny the role of vested interest groups in the rebellion, overall, he not only does not touch on the extremely cruel exploitation system of this society but also actually confuses the vast majority of the exploited with the small number of exploiters and, on this basis, denies that the Tibetan rebellion should be the responsibility of a few upper-class reactionaries and describes the Chinese people's just action of suppressing the rebellion as a "tragedy," expressing sympathy for the rebellion. In this way, he has made a very regrettable mistake. As a friend of India and as a party to the issues Nehru discusses, we believe it is necessary to point out this mistake. If we agree with Nehru's logic, then not only the revolution in Tibet is not allowed, but the entire Chinese revolution is also not allowed. Everyone remembers that before liberation, although the Han areas were not a serf society, they were basically not outside the scope of feudal society. This society was also long called stagnant, unchanging, and isolated from the world. Some people also mocked us for starting from outdated, outdated, extremely simplified, and completely inappropriate foreign ideas—Marxism-Leninism, asserting that our reform movement would face resistance from the entire society and nation, and even declaring that we were splitting the nation, betraying the country, and were agents of the so-called "Red Imperialism" of Moscow, etc., etc. Now history has given the verdict: we are right, not them. All attacks and slanders against communists have completely failed. The stagnant, unchanging China has, under the leadership of the proletariat, changed into a vibrant, rapidly advancing China, proving that the analysis of Marxism-Leninism is universally applicable. The past stagnation was only because the development of productive forces was constrained by backward production relations. Marxist-Leninists, communists, truly represent the interests of the nation and the country, while that small group of anti-communists, although they once temporarily deceived a part of the masses, have truly been proven to be agents of imperialism. We believe that the conclusion of Chinese history, Mr. Nehru will not oppose. However, according to Nehru's logic on the Tibet issue, as long as his sympathy is not limited to the "Tibetan people" but expanded to the entire "Chinese people," then the entire Chinese revolution would also become an unprecedented great "tragedy." During the Chinese People's Liberation War, Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang and the Kuomintang army were much more numerous than the about 20,000 Tibetan rebels, and there were also many more reasons to say they were not just "upper-class reactionaries," the scale of the war was also much larger, in short, the sympathy that should be aroused was much stronger. However, as far as we know, Mr. Nehru did not sympathize with the "big serf owners" of the Han people when he sympathized with the entire China, but when he sympathized with a part of China—Tibet, he sympathized with the "little Chiang Kai-sheks" of Tibet. This extreme contradiction, how can it be understood?

Mr. Nehru might say we are unfair because he only spoke of Tibet, and Tibetans and Han people are different. This means that Han people leading the revolution in Tibet will inevitably encounter national obstacles. Tibetans and Han people are indeed different. Not only that, Mongols, Uygurs, Zhuang, Hui, Miao, Koreans, and other ethnic minorities in China are also different from Han people. In front of Chinese communists and the Chinese government, there is the issue of ethnic minorities within the country. We treat this issue with great caution. We have spent nearly ten years cultivating cadres from various ethnic minorities and have seriously conducted education against Han chauvinism among Han people, especially among Han cadres, Han Communist Party members, and Han officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army. We have adopted a method unprecedented in the capitalist world, persuading Han people in areas where ethnic minorities live together with Han people to establish autonomous regions for ethnic minorities. For example, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, and other autonomous prefectures and counties were established in this way. In Tibet, to win the cooperation of the Tibetan upper class, we have used extraordinary patience, and for eight years since the peaceful liberation, we have always maintained the original Tibetan local government, its system, its army, and even its currency, always persuading the Tibetan people to temporarily not carry out the reforms they urgently demand. If the Central People's Government, as stated in the so-called declaration of the Dalai Lama, did not give the original Tibetan local government any autonomy, then those traitors with evidence would have been arrested and punished long ago, and the democratic reform in Tibet would not have been delayed until now. The Central People's Government has taken such a lenient attitude towards those reactionaries that even after the rebellion in Lhasa broke out, even after knowing that the Dalai Lama had been abducted from Lhasa, the troops of the Tibet Military Region of the People's Liberation Army still waited for seven hours after the rebels directly launched an armed attack on the Military Region before starting to counterattack. Obviously, at this point, the reactionaries had blocked the path of peaceful resolution, and there was no other way but to resolutely suppress and pacify the rebellion. The People's Liberation Army, if it wanted to take the initiative, could have surrounded the Norbulingka long ago and prevented the rebels from abducting the Dalai Lama. Any sensible person who thinks about it will understand this logic and will not pay attention to fairy tales about a few shells hitting the palace and falling into the pond. The Central People's Government and the People's Liberation Army, facing this serious situation, have always insisted on the policy of not firing the first shot, which shows that the communists have always been very cautious in dealing with ethnic issues and have made the greatest efforts to win over the Tibetan upper class. This policy can only be seriously implemented by the revolutionary proletariat, and the bourgeoisie or other exploiting classes, even if they want to do so, cannot do so.

Here, the key to the issue of ethnic relations is still the problem of the method of class analysis. Mr. Nehru hopes that we will "strive for their friendly cooperation," which is undoubtedly a good idea, although Mr. Nehru's intention is to indirectly criticize us for not doing so in the past and present. In fact, only the revolutionary proletariat can thoroughly and correctly solve the historical ethnic issues. Ethnic conflicts and estrangement are basically created by the exploiting classes, and the exploiting classes can never eliminate this phenomenon. However, the working people of various ethnicities, under the correct leadership of the revolutionary proletariat, can completely eliminate all conflicts and estrangement left over from history through certain efforts and forge a brotherly, harmonious friendship. There has been a long period of ethnic oppression and ethnic struggle in Chinese history. Mongol rulers and Manchu rulers oppressed the Han, Uygurs, and Tibetans, while Han rulers also oppressed the Mongols, Manchus, Uygurs, and Tibetans. After the establishment of the People's Republic of China under the leadership of the proletariat, the situation changed fundamentally. The Han people, who make up the absolute majority of the population and are the main force of the revolution, now still need to send some personnel to Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, and Tibet, but now it is not to oppress and exploit the ethnic minorities there but to work with local ethnic revolutionary cadres to help the laborers there gain freedom and liberation from their own ethnic oppressors and exploiters, achieve democracy and socialism, that is, to lay the foundation for the prosperity and flourishing of the economy and culture of various ethnic minorities. The Han communist personnel working in these regions, including the Han officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, not only do not ride roughshod over the ethnic minorities but, on the contrary, work with the local ethnic revolutionary cadres to serve the ethnic minorities. They often brave hardships and share weal and woe with the ethnic laborers, fighting for their rights and happiness. In this way, the laborers of various ethnic minorities, as well as all patriotic, reform-supporting upper and middle-class individuals of various ethnic minorities, unite with the Han laborers and, like the Han people, overthrow the reactionary rule of the upper-class reactionaries of their own ethnicities. In this way, the root of ethnic conflicts and estrangement is eliminated, and the friendly cooperation of various ethnicities is genuinely consolidated. This process has been realized in Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, and the northwestern regions of Ningxia, Gansu, and Qinghai, as well as the southwestern regions of Sichuan, Guizhou, Yunnan, and Guangxi. In this process, the leading cadres of the reform have always tried to unite the reform-supporting individuals of various classes of various ethnic minorities and maintain close cooperation with them before, during, and after the reform. Indeed, there cannot be no struggle, and armed rebellions have occurred in the Tibetan regions of Sichuan, Gansu, and Qinghai. However, as we have pointed out elsewhere, these Tibetan rebellions were instigated and incited by the reactionaries in Tibet using their special positions.

Title: The West Tibet Rebellion and the Indian Government's Position

Page: 1

In Tibet, due to the fact that the large landlord class's rule did not change during the peaceful liberation process, they could still use their legal status to command the old Tibetan army, Kham rebels, and other reactionary political organizations to defend the serf system. They also continued to collude with some foreign interveners. Because of this, not only was there no reform, but they were also able to instigate this rebellion. However, even so, since the People's Liberation Army entered Tibet, the Tibetan people have repeatedly and enthusiastically called for reform. The Tibetan people, who are suffering in deep misery, are not afraid of reform; they are afraid that the Central People's Government will be too lenient with the large landlords in Tibet and delay reform year after year! Humanitarians around the world should know: Tibetan serfs are also people. It is impossible for them to believe that those who ruthlessly exploit them, whip them, and gouge out their eyes are their protectors. It is impossible for them to believe that the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, who help them with their labor and treat their illnesses without taking a single needle or thread, are their enemies. This is the fundamental reason why, despite the fact that this rebellion was carried out under the banner of nationalism and religion, despite the high mountains and deep valleys, despite various forms of foreign aid, it did not receive any support from the Tibetan people and was quickly defeated. The Tibetan people were overjoyed, as if they had received sweet rain after a long drought, when the People's Liberation Army confiscated the official seals of the feudal government, the weapons of the rebels, and the torture instruments of the landlords, known as "law whips." These three items had oppressed them too cruelly! They voluntarily guided the soldiers, reported rebel movements, and assisted in capturing remaining rebels and searching for weapons. In just one place, the Lhasa People's Court, hundreds of guns were voluntarily turned in by the people. In Shannan, when the people heard that the PLA was coming, they immediately gathered to present hadas, fresh peach blossoms, and tender willow branches to the soldiers, and at the same time, they cried out to the PLA to avenge the rebels' crimes of rape, looting, killing, and arson. The rebels in Kongka had dug four trenches on the road to block the PLA's advance, but as soon as the rebels left, the local residents immediately filled in the trenches. As soon as the PLA arrived in Nyingchi, the local people immediately organized a horse and mule transport team to help the PLA transport ammunition and supplies, and followed the PLA to pursue and eliminate the remaining rebels. There are countless such moving examples. Once the rebellion was suppressed, the masses quickly helped the People's Government restore order and quickly turned to production with the help of the People's Government. Although the spring plowing in Shannan was delayed by half a month due to rebel disturbances, with the help of the PLA, the sowing period was not extended. There, groups of people were fertilizing, sowing, and repairing irrigation channels, and singing joyful songs that they had not sung in a long time. Farmers eagerly asked when the land would be distributed. After it was announced, in response to the people's demands, that the land of the rebellion leaders would be farmed by whoever tilled it this year, one of the main culprits in kidnapping the Dalai Lama, the large landlord Sogang Wangqing Gele, immediately organized all the labor force in Kaixi Ka to form labor mutual aid teams to jointly cultivate all the land and strive for a bumper harvest. It is clear that the Tibetan farmers believe that the day when they will stand up and take control of their land in Tibet is not far off. We apologize for talking too much here... However, all those who care about Tibet, please look, all this is so different from the situation when the old-style Chinese army entered Tibet during the Qing Dynasty! It is so different from the situation when the British invasion force entered Lhasa from India! How can the just actions of the People's Liberation Army, together with the Tibetan people, to suppress the rebels who killed and burned, and committed all kinds of evil, be described as national oppression and national aggression?

Mr. Nehru claims that there is no common ground between Han society and Tibetan society, and that attempts to break through psychological and emotional barriers between the two have either not been made or have failed. For the working people of Tibet, this question has already been answered by facts, and will be answered even more vividly in the future. Even for the upper-class Tibetans, the psychological and emotional barriers of many of them have already changed to varying degrees. The Dalai Lama's three letters secretly and spontaneously written to General Tan Gantang while being kidnapped, and the speeches of Panchen Erdeni, Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme, Jia Cuo, Awang Jia Cuo, and Huang Zhengqing at the People's Congress, are all part of the evidence of this change. On the side of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, there are a large number of patriotic upper and middle-class Tibetans. The students of primary and secondary schools in Lhasa are mostly children of the upper and middle classes, and as soon as the rebellion ended, they came to school, and the number of students was much larger than before the rebellion. It is clear that the claim that the rebellion is a "national revolution" and the suppression of the rebellion is a "national tragedy" is groundless.

Some Indian friends who have no ill will towards China, due to the influence of long-term biased propaganda and the lack of direct observation of Tibetan social life and the activities of the People's Liberation Army, and the fact that their newspapers rarely publish complete information from the Chinese side, may have misunderstood China's position and policy. This is possible. However, facts speak louder than words. We are fully confident that those Indian friends who have temporarily misunderstood and are still skeptical of what we have said will eventually draw objective conclusions. We hope that Mr. Nehru is also one of them. Of course, Mr. Nehru has great confidence and has an independent view on the Tibetan issue. He tends to assume that the powerful groups in the former Tibetan local government are a group of pure lambs, and therefore, even when they attack us, it is still our fault. We cannot require our foreign friends to agree with us on Chinese affairs, and we certainly cannot require Mr. Nehru to change his philosophical, historical, and political views. In Mr. Nehru's mind, there are obviously contradictions, but we do not intend to discuss how to resolve these contradictions. On such issues, we can have friendly debates, but we can also not debate. Everyone has a lot of work at home, and it is enough to sweep the snow in front of one's own door. Why bother with the frost on someone else's roof? Mr. Nehru said well in Beijing: "To impose the will of one country on another, or to impose the way of life of one people on another, any such attempt will inevitably lead to conflict and threaten peace." However, the problem now is that a group of Indians, unfortunately including Mr. Nehru, insist that we act according to their suggestions. We are good friends and neighbors, you walk your path, and I walk mine, isn't it completely possible to coexist peacefully? If your method works well in India, then we can learn from you later. What is the need to be so impatient now, even to the point of resorting to certain interfering behaviors that hinder friendship?

Mr. Nehru, the Prime Minister, denies that India has interfered in Tibet. He recalled the situation before and after India's independence and partition, proving that India has never had "political or secret ambitions" for Tibet. We acknowledge that Mr. Nehru's words, in this sense, are in line with reality, that is, the Indian government does not intend to annex Tibet or send troops to interfere in Tibetan affairs. India has always acknowledged that Tibet is part of China, and the Chinese government enjoys sovereignty over Tibet. India signed the Agreement on Trade and Communications between the Tibet Region of China and India in 1954 based on the Five Principles, and subsequently withdrew its troops from Tibet and handed over Indian postal and telecommunications facilities. These are all satisfactory to the Chinese people. However, the interference of one country in the internal affairs of another can take many forms. To say that the Indian government has never interfered in any form with China's Tibet in the past and present is not convincing.

People remember that this newspaper also published that when the Chinese government ordered its troops to enter Tibet in October 1950, the Indian government had already interfered through diplomatic channels. At that time, the Chinese government, while ordering the advance into Tibet, also requested the Tibetan local government to send representatives to Beijing for negotiations. This was a matter of internal politics within China's sovereignty. However, the Indian government sent three notes to the Chinese government on October 21, October 28, and November 1, 1950, stating that "the entry of Chinese troops into Tibet must be regarded as regrettable," that it was "unjustified," and that this was "most surprising and regrettable" to the Indian government. The notes also proposed that the entry of Chinese troops into their own territory of Tibet "would give those countries that are unfriendly to China an opportunity to engage in anti-China propaganda at this critical and delicate moment in international affairs"; it would "have serious consequences and would give those countries that oppose the participation of the People's Government in the United Nations and the Security Council strong support" in the issue of restoring China's representation in the United Nations; it would "create prejudice in the minds of the world's people against China's position"; it would make it difficult for the Central People's Government to conduct "peaceful negotiations" with the Tibetan local government at the same time; it would not "be in the interest of China or peace"; it would "greatly increase world tensions and lead to the trend of a major war"; it would "affect" the "friendship between India and China and the interests of world peace." In response, the Chinese government pointed out in its reply to the Indian government's notes that the advance of the People's Liberation Army into Tibet was an exercise of state sovereignty, and that the Tibetan issue was China's internal affair, and that any foreign interference was not allowed. This issue is completely unrelated to the issue of China's representation in the United Nations; if those countries that are unfriendly to China actually use the issue of representation in the United Nations to threaten China not to exercise sovereignty in its own territory, that only shows once again the hostile attitude of these countries towards China. After the Chinese government repeatedly and resolutely expressed this serious attitude, especially after the People's Liberation Army achieved a major victory in the Changdu area by annihilating the main force of the Tibetan army that attempted to block the advance into Tibet, the delegation of the Tibetan local government that had been staying in India finally arrived in Beijing in late April 1951. After negotiations, the "Seventeen-Point Agreement on the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet" was finally reached in May of that year.

Bringing up this episode may be unpleasant. However, facts are facts. How can it be said that the Indian government has never interfered in Tibet?

Unfortunately, such interference continues in some form. This interference occurs after the two countries' governments jointly declared the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence as the guiding principles for their relations, which makes it even more regrettable. Just take Mr. Nehru himself, in his statements and speeches after the Tibetan rebellion, although there are many friendly expressions, some of his words we feel do not conform to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. For example, he said, "Beijing has not adhered to the agreement between Tibet and China on the Tibet Autonomous Region and the assurances given to India. There has been armed intervention there" (April 13). "I sincerely hope that the Tibetan people will be able to maintain and enjoy their autonomy without oppression and suppression by others" (April 14). How can it be said that this is not interference to describe the suppression of a rebellion in one's own territory as "armed intervention," as "oppression and suppression" of their "autonomy," and to say that there has been no adherence to "assurances given to India"? The Indian government insists that the Dalai Lama was not kidnapped by the rebels but was the leader of the rebels. If so, the Indian government's warm welcome to the Dalai Lama and Mr. Nehru's visit to Mussoorie, does this not mean welcoming and consulting with the leader of a rebellion in a friendly country? Because the Indian government has never clearly implemented a policy of non-interference, it is not difficult to understand why the chairman of the ruling Congress Party, Mrs. Gandhi, and the general secretary of the Congress Party, Mrs. Kriplani, both declared Tibet to be a "state" or "autonomous state," and the "Committee to Support the Tibetan People," including the Congress Party, openly demanded that the Tibetan issue be submitted to the United Nations. Indian newspapers openly slandered the Chinese government for "adopting banditry and practicing imperialism," insulted the head of state of China as a "detestable snowman," and demanded the convening of another Simla-style conference with the so-called India, Tibet, and China to solve the purely internal Tibetan issue. After the Tibetan rebellion, and even before it, some Indian politicians and newspapers launched a campaign to slander China on a large scale, reminiscent of the interference of the U.S. government and press in the execution of counter-revolutionary criminals in Cuba. How can it be said that such methods of exerting political pressure on the internal affairs of a friendly country conform to the Five Principles?

The Simla Conference was a so-called "Sino-British-Tibetan Conference" held in Simla, India, in October 1913. This conference was an important plot of British imperialism to invade Tibet. Participants included the British representative of the Indian colonial government, the Foreign Secretary McMahon, the Tibetan representative Lhasing Kangtola, and the representative of the Yuan Shikai government, the Tibetan Pacification Commissioner Chen Yifan. The British representative monopolized the Simla Conference and proposed a so-called plan to solve the Tibetan issue at the conference, the main contents of which included: "The Chinese government acknowledges that Tibet has complete autonomy and will not be changed into a province"; "The Chinese government will not station troops in Tibet except for the guards of the Tibetan Affairs Commissioner"; "In case of disputes between the Chinese government and Tibet, they will be adjudicated by the Indian government"; "British people will be allowed to trade freely in Tibet, and the Chinese government will not impose any restrictions"; and "Tibet's internal affairs will be temporarily supervised by the Indian government, and the British government will be allowed to station representatives in Lhasa." Obviously, the purpose of the British proposal was to make Tibet secede from China and be ruled by the British colonial government in India, enslaving the Tibetan people. Therefore, this plan was firmly opposed by the Chinese people, and even the Yuan Shikai government refused to accept it.

Mr. Nehru said that India's reaction to the Tibetan issue is essentially not political but instinctive, mainly based on emotions and humanitarian reasons, and also based on the close relationship with the Tibetan people due to long-standing religious and cultural ties. We understand that the Indian people have a close relationship with the Tibetan people; not only that, the Indian people also have a close relationship with the entire Chinese people. When Premier Zhou Enlai visited India, he heard the enthusiastic slogan "Indians and Chinese are brothers" everywhere, and the scene was as if it were yesterday. How can the feelings for the Tibetan people be used as a reason for some politicians to damage the feelings for the Chinese people and interfere in China's internal affairs? This logic has an obvious danger because if such logic can be established, then after Tibet takes the path of democratic socialism and prosperity, can it also be used as a reason to organize something like the "Committee to Support the People of Assam" or the "North Province Affairs Committee" to interfere in the affairs of Assam or the North Province in India? Can the Tibetan Autonomous Region government and the entire Chinese government announce their deep sympathy for the people of Assam or the North Province as a basic policy and interfere in the affairs of those provinces based on this policy? If the Indian government can use the deep sympathy and long-standing ties with the Tibetan people as a reason to demand that the Chinese government give India some assurances, then can the Indian government not simply use the deep sympathy and long-standing ties with the entire Chinese people as a reason to demand that the Chinese government give India some assurances on all internal affairs? Similarly, can the Chinese government not use the deep sympathy and long-standing ties with the Indian people as a reason to demand that the Indian government give China some assurances on its internal affairs? Then what about peaceful coexistence and the Five Principles? Wouldn't the world fall into chaos of mutual interference? We believe that our Indian friends, like us, will not welcome and cannot tolerate such an international order.

By linking the two instances of India's interference in China's Tibet, one can see that although the Indian government does not intend to occupy Tibet or make it formally independent, it indeed tries to obstruct China from exercising complete sovereignty over its own territory of Tibet. Some Indian politicians in this regard have inherited the tradition of the past British government: they only acknowledge China's so-called "suzerainty" over Tibet, just as India's "suzerainty" over Bhutan and Sikkim. Their so-called Tibetan "autonomy" is different from the national regional autonomy stipulated in the Chinese Constitution, different from the national regional autonomy in Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, Guangxi, Ningxia, and other places, but a semi-independent state. It is true that Tibet is not a province, but an autonomous region of the People's Republic of China, which has more powers stipulated by the Constitution and laws than a province, but it is certainly not a protectorate—neither a protectorate of China, nor a protectorate of India, nor a joint protectorate of China and India, nor a buffer state between China and India. The People's Republic of China enjoys complete sovereignty over the Tibet region, just as it enjoys complete sovereignty over Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, Guangxi, Ningxia, and other regions. This is beyond doubt and beyond any interference by any foreign country or the United Nations in any name or form. Therefore, any issue in Tibet can only be solved by China, in China, and cannot be solved in any foreign country. Any semi-independent status of Tibet is not in the interest of the Tibetan people, not in the interest of the entire Chinese people, not in the interest of the Indian people, not in the interest of Sino-Indian friendship and Asian peace, but only in the interest of the treacherous and reactionary large landlords in Tibet and the foreign interveners who support this group of treacherous and reactionary large landlords, and only in the interest of those expansionist elements and imperialist conspirators who want to create disputes between China and India. China and India are two peace-loving countries with a long history of friendship, and we have a thousand reasons to live in harmony, not to invade each other, not to interfere in each other's affairs, and we have no reason to conflict with each other, to set up buffer regions; if we insist on setting up, it would precisely create a truly regrettable conflict that does not exist. In view of the Indian government's attitude on this issue, in view of the statements of some irresponsible Indian figures, we believe that it is necessary to clarify this thoroughly in order to consolidate Sino-Indian friendship. When Mr. Nehru mentioned the Five Principles in his speech on April 27, he only mentioned "mutual respect" (which is undoubtedly necessary), but did not mention "mutual respect for territorial integrity and sovereignty" (which is the original wording of the Five Principles and is also the prerequisite for any mutual respect). We hope that this is just an oversight.

The interference of some Indian politicians in China's internal affairs is not an accidental phenomenon. It has the characteristics of the times. India is a country that has broken free from British imperialist colonial rule and gained independence, and it demands to develop its national economy in a peaceful international environment, which has deep contradictions with imperialist and colonialist forces. This is one aspect. On the other hand, the Indian big bourgeoisie has a thousand ties with imperialism and has a certain degree of dependence on foreign capital. Moreover, the class nature of the big bourgeoisie also determines its desire for some external expansion. This makes it, while opposing imperialist interference policies, also more or less consciously reflect the influence of certain imperialist interference policies. In international affairs, the Indian government led by Prime Minister Nehru, in opposing war, maintaining peace, and opposing colonialism, in executing a foreign policy of friendship with China, the Soviet Union, and other socialist countries, and not joining the military bloc of American imperialism, generally reflects the will of the Indian people and plays and will continue to play an important and respected role. However, due to historical reasons, the Indian big bourgeoisie has inherited and tries to continue to maintain some of the legacies left by the British colonial rulers. Of course, the great Indian people bear no responsibility for the two-facedness of the Indian bourgeoisie. We also believe that not only the Indian people but also all far-sighted and wise people in the Indian government acknowledge that India's way out is in progress, in looking forward, not backward. We, like them, believe that the government of a country that has only recently gained independence and is now also threatened by imperialist interferers, interferes in the affairs of a neighboring country, is a regrettable phenomenon in modern international politics.

We can have this or that difference of opinion with Mr. Nehru, but on this point, we probably have no difference, that is, China has not interfered in India's internal affairs. The Chinese people only began to counterattack after a large number of slanderous statements were issued from the Indian side. In his speech on April 27, Mr. Nehru rightly condemned certain Indians' actions aimed at sabotaging Sino-Indian friendly relations. Unfortunately, he then focused on attacking China's anti-interference statements. He said, "The comments and criticisms made by China's responsible figures about India" are "irrespective of the facts and etiquette, using the language of the Cold War." However, China's accusations of Indian interference are based on facts, as stated above. China's media's doubts about the authenticity of the so-called Dalai Lama's statement are also based on facts, and the large number of loopholes and traces of impersonation in this statement still objectively exist. Obviously, those who kidnapped the Dalai Lama to India and those who have long been gathered in Kalimpong to engage in treasonous activities are now trying to use the so-called Dalai Lama's statement to block the Dalai Lama's return to his homeland, which is inconsistent with Mr. Nehru's repeated expressions of willingness.

As for the importance of facts and etiquette, we regret that some Indian politicians and newspapers have said a lot about China in the past month or so that cannot be considered factual and etiquette. We have noticed that Mr. Nehru has played a role in restraint in this regard, which is undoubtedly beneficial to Sino-Indian friendship. However, we cannot say that his words are also factual and etiquette when he accuses the Central People's Government of violating the Seventeen-Point Agreement and proposes so-called assurances to India. As for the language of the Cold War, then the language of some Indian politicians and newspapers, cursing China as "new and vicious imperialism," "expansionist imperialism," attacking China's suppression of the Tibetan rebellion as "military intervention," "colonial action," "banditry," all these, are they not the language of the Cold War? For this kind of "Cold War language," we have been very patient and restrained for a considerable period of time, and our newspapers have almost kept silent. People remember that as late as April 18, Premier Zhou Enlai still made a sincere call to maintain Sino-Indian friendship at the Second Session of the First National People's Congress. However, it is heartbreaking that all this has only resulted in the great publicity of the so-called Dalai Lama's statement and more shameless attacks on our government and people. There is no way out, and we have to counterattack. Some people try to use "freedom of speech" to defend India's anti-China slander campaign. But why don't they think, don't Chinese people also need freedom of speech? Tibet is our territory, the Tibetan issue is our internal affairs, foreigners can have so-called instinctive reactions, but our people will have no instinctive reactions? Now, some foreign countries' anti-China slander campaign seems to have subsided, reason is regaining the upper hand, but there are still a few people trying to continue to fan the flames. We can warn these people: as long as your anti-China slander campaign does not stop, our counterattack will not stop. You are willing to spend as much time as we are prepared to pay the same amount of time, and we are also prepared for you to incite other countries to besiege us, and we are prepared for the cheering of all imperialist elements in the world behind you. However, to interfere in China's internal affairs and to save the desperate rule of the Tibetan large landlords is hopeless. The more the anti-China slander campaign of all anti-communist and anti-China people in the world curses us, the more they expose their true face, and the more they educate the people of the world.

As mentioned earlier, there are many people in the world discussing the Tibetan issue, and their starting points are also very different. Mr. Nehru is different from many people who obviously harbor ill will towards China. He has some differences with us on the Tibetan issue, but in general, he advocates Sino-Indian friendship, and we have no doubt about this. The reason we give such a detailed response to Mr. Nehru's accusations (of course, there are also many places in the article that involve those who obviously harbor ill will towards us) is precisely because we have full confidence: differences can be narrowed, and disputes can be resolved. Indeed, the dispute is somewhat sharp because it involves the vital interests of our motherland and the Tibetan people. However, we still hope that our dispute can be beneficial to the mutual understanding of the two countries' peoples, beneficial to the friendship between the two countries' peoples and governments, and in language, it can also avoid neglecting friendship and courtesy. We fully agree with some of Mr. Nehru's earnest, very friendly words to the Chinese people. He said, "We very much hope to maintain the friendship between India and China." "If these two great countries of Asia, these two countries that have been friendly neighbors for generations, should develop hostile feelings towards each other, it would be a tragedy." Sino-Indian friendship has a long history and a deep foundation, we will not forget our common interests, and we will not fall into the trap of our common enemies. Although this dispute is regrettable, we are firmly convinced that it will not create hostile feelings, and it will not shake the friendship between the two countries. Mr. Nehru announced that India has no intention of interfering in Tibet. We warmly welcome this friendly statement. As long as the Indian side stops interfering in Tibet, the current dispute will end. China has never interfered with India and will never interfere with India. We also want to solemnly tell all Indian patriots who care about India's security: a democratic, prosperous Tibet Autonomous Region, as one of the members of the Chinese family of nationalities, will certainly be a factor in consolidating and strengthening Sino-Indian friendship and will never be and will never become a "threat" to the Republic of India. The peaceful neighborly policy of socialist China is unshakable, and the friendship between the nearly 1.1 billion people of the two countries is unshakable, just like the Himalayas are unshakable, and the slanderers' nonsense is groundless. When Mr. Nehru visited our country in October 1954, he said: "China and India are both great countries facing similar problems and have both resolutely taken the path of progress. The deeper the two countries understand each other, the more the welfare of Asia and the world will be guaranteed. The tense situation in the world today requires us to work together for peace!" We want the people of the two countries to always remember the truth pointed out by Mr. Nehru here. Like the Chinese people, the great Indian people have always cherished the friendship between China and India. We are convinced that the rumors that poison Sino-Indian relations, with the understanding of the facts and the joint efforts of the relevant personnel of the two countries, will be exposed and abandoned by the broad masses of the Indian people. The two countries and their peoples will continue to cooperate in friendship in the cause of peaceful construction and will continue to strive hand in hand for the peace of Asia and the world.

　　西藏的革命和尼赫鲁的哲学
　　人民日报编辑部
    西藏少数卖国贼发动的一场叛乱战争，已经基本上平息了。叛乱分子所造成的流血冲突，随着他们的可耻的失败，在西藏绝大部分土地上停止了。现在，西藏正在面临着一次和平的革命，这就是全国人民代表大会决议所指出的西藏广大人民期待已久和迫切要求的民主改革。这是一场革命，是1949年前后席卷中国大陆的人民大革命在西藏的继续。这场革命在西藏和平解放以来的八年中，一直因为原西藏地方政府的阻挠而拖延了。在叛乱平定之后接着进行的革命，将是一场和平的革命，就是说，不流血的革命。西藏人民对于西藏的没有参加叛乱的上层阶级将采取赎买的政策，就跟在汉族地区对待民族资产阶级的政策差不多。因为在西藏人民的背后，有全中国已经完成了民主改革和社会主义改造的几亿人民的支援，有充分的条件这样做。
    现在世界上很多国家的舆论正在对西藏问题大谈特谈，这是一件极大的好事。这个从来不曾被人们认真注意过的世界屋脊上的一百多万人民，完全有权利享受这分光荣，让全世界注意他们，让他们在全世界的议论中得到教育，得到锻炼。有些外国人说：西藏的少数反动分子的叛乱是“革命”，是“民族主义”的、“反侵略”的、“反殖民主义”的、“反帝国主义”的“革命”，他们应该获得“完全”的“不受侵犯”的自治或者“独立”；而人民解放军在藏族人民的积极支持下对于叛乱的平定，则是“武装干涉”，是“侵略”，是“殖民主义”和“帝国主义”，是“希特勒”。这样说的人是西方帝国主义者，是各国的反动派，例如亚洲的岸信介、李承晚、乃沙立、吴庭艳和蒋介石（但是他并不赞成西藏独立，而要求西藏归顺台湾）。还有一些资本主义国家的一部分资产阶级，他们的一般政治态度同上述那些人不同，但是在这个问题上却同帝国主义站在一边，例如印度的某些资产阶级分子。所有上述的这些人在世界上是少数，在本国也是少数，但是他们控制着相当大量的宣传机器，一时显得颇为嚣张。世界上更多的人说，西藏的叛乱是反动的，平定叛乱是正义的。社会主义各国人民一致支持中国人民对叛乱分子的斗争。就是在资本主义世界，站在中国人民方面的也占大多数。他们包括各国的劳动人民，主张正义和进步的人士，和正在反对外国侵略外国干涉的民族资产阶级。这些民族资产阶级懂得，赞成外国干涉西藏，就等于赞成外国干涉印度尼西亚、锡兰、柬埔寨、尼泊尔、伊拉克、古巴以及亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲许多国家的内政，等于赞成侵犯这些国家的主权和领土完整。但是在有一些资本主义国家，这种正义的声音暂时没有那批反中国的宣传机器所造成的喧声高。有些人感觉难过：好端端一个中华人民共和国，好端端的中印友好，如果不出西藏叛乱，岂不更好！他们的心是好的，但是，他们没有看出，西藏叛乱既然发生了，而又迅速平定了，坏事就变成了好事。西藏的革命被这次叛乱加速了，而西藏的民主化将最终结束外国干涉西藏的历史，这对于中印友好的真正巩固也是完全必要的。总之，对于这种种不同议论，不但西藏人民和全中国人民应该认真研究，得到教训，而且许多资本主义国家的人民，特别是那些对西藏问题大嚷特嚷的资本主义国家中的人民，也将会加以研究，得到他们所需要的教训。
    我们现在想谈谈尼赫鲁先生4月27日在印度人民院的讲话。（本报编辑部按：在我们写好这篇评论以后，我们读到了尼赫鲁总理5月4日在印度联邦院的讲话。这篇讲话的主要论点并没有超出4月27日讲话的范围。所以，我们没有对它作任何的修改和补充。）
  尼赫鲁先生从今年3月17日到4月底，在议会讲西藏问题，这是第七次了。尼赫鲁先生曾经多次表示同情所谓“西藏人的自治愿望”，反对中国的所谓“武装干涉”。在4月27日，他讲的话比较更有系统，本报已经在4月30日全文发表过了。为了读者的方便，我们现在把他的话再引出一段，这段话在很大程度上可以作为他对于西藏叛乱和印度作用的看法的一个提要：
    “情况无疑是困难的。一方面，是一个生气勃勃的、迅速前进的社会；而另一方面是一个停滞不前的、没有改变的、担心可能会在改革的名义下对自己采取什么行动的社会。两者之间的距离很大，看来很难有任何会合点。与此同时，某种形式的改变不可避免地来到了西藏。交通迅速地发展了，西藏长期的与世隔绝的状态部分地被冲破了。虽然物质上的障碍逐步消除了，可是心理上和感情上的障碍却增加了。显然，冲破这些心理上和感情上的障碍的尝试或者没有作，或者作了没有成功。
    “如果说这完全要由西藏若干‘上层反动分子’负责，看来这种说法是把一种复杂的情况异乎寻常地简单化了。甚至根据得自中国方面的消息，西藏暴乱的规模也是相当大的，这个暴乱的基础一定是强烈的民族主义情绪，这种情绪不仅影响着上层阶级的人，而且影响着其他人。毫无疑问，既得利益集团参加了暴乱，并且企图从中得利。试图用颇为陈腐的字眼、措辞和口号来解释情况，是很少有什么帮助的。
    “当这些不愉快的事态发展的消息传到印度来的时候，立即引起了强烈的普遍的反应。这种反应并不是政府引起的。这种反应实质上也不是政治性的。这种反应主要是一种基于情感和人道原因的同情。它的产生也还基于同西藏人民久远的宗教和文化联系所造成的亲密感情。这是本能的反应。不错，印度有些人的确企图把这种反应引导到不当的方向，而从中得利。但是，印度人民的反应却是明摆着的事实。如果这里的反应尚且如此，那么人们就不难设想西藏人自己的反应怎样了。也许亚洲的其他佛教国家也有这种反应。当这种实质上不是政治性的强烈情绪存在的时候，那是不能仅仅用政治方法来处理的，更不能用军事方法来处理了。我们一点也不想干涉西藏；我们非常希望保持印度和中国之间的友谊；但是同时，我们非常同情西藏人民，我们对于他们的困难处境感到非常难过。我们仍然希望，中国当局会采取明智的态度，不使用他们巨大的力量来对付西藏人，而根据他们自己就西藏地区的自治作出的保证，争取他们友好合作。首先，我们希望，目前的战斗和杀戮将会终止。”尼赫鲁所谓西藏的“停滞不前的、没有改变的、担心可能会在改革的名义下对自己采取什么行动的社会”，究竟是一个什么样的社会，他没有说明。但是，这正是全部问题的出发点。我们的讨论必须从这里开始，也只能从这里开始。
    西藏社会是一个领主庄园制的农奴社会。在西藏，主要的生产资料——全部土地和绝大部分牲畜都属于三种领主，也就是农奴主，即官家（封建政府）、寺院和贵族。这三种农奴主只占西藏一百二十万人口中的百分之五左右，即六万人左右。所有的农民和大部分牧民都没有自己的土地和牲畜，只能为农奴主劳动。他们自己，连同他们的子女，世世代代，都分别隶属于不同的农奴主。农奴主的领地一部分属于专为封建政府支差的土地，被分配种这些土地的农奴要无偿地担负封建政府各种名目的差役。兵役也由这些领地上的一部分农奴担负。其余的领地是农奴主的所谓“自营地”。在这种领地上，农奴要用自己的耕牛农具（有时还要带自己的伙食）为领主耕种全部土地，而领主只给一小块（约占领主土地的十分之三）不好的份地给农奴作为代价。农奴每年要用绝大部分时间在农奴主的土地上劳动，并且要为农奴主作各种无偿的劳役。在以上这两种领地上，农奴的劳动收入的百分之七十以上都成为农奴主的剥削收入。农奴的收入一般都难于维持生活，因此不能不向农奴主借高利贷。大批农奴所欠的债无法偿还，以至有已经欠了几百年的债。农奴不但没有任何政治权利，而且没有普通的行动自由，短期外出也必须由领主准假。
    西藏的贵族是世袭的。全西藏现在有贵族二三百家，其地位高低看财产多少而定。大贵族约占贵族总数的十分之一，即二十几家，他们每家都有几十处庄园，几千个农奴。西藏封建政府的权力始终掌握在这些大贵族手中。贵族和农奴等级的界限很森严。农奴见了贵族要回避或鞠躬吐舌，表示敬畏，讲话也要有一定的讲法，不许讲错。贵族对于逃亡的农奴或者其他被认为违法的农奴，可以任意用刑，除了最通常的鞭打以外，还有剜眼、割鼻、割手、割脚筋、挖膝盖骨等各种骇人听闻的酷刑。
    西藏的寺院在社会生活中占有重要地位。寺院的正当宗教活动和人民的宗教信仰自由，无论在什么时候，都是必须加以保护和尊重的。但是，西藏寺院的统治者，到目前为止，却都同时是农奴主。寺院在高利贷和商业方面对于农奴的剥削，比官家和贵族更苛刻。寺院对农奴还多一重以宗教名义进行的剥削。寺院内部也是等级森严，农奴出身的贫苦喇嘛和小喇嘛，在寺院中也是被剥削者。寺院内也设有各种刑具和牢狱，对于农奴和下层喇嘛可以任意处刑，其残酷的程度同其他农奴主没有两样。
    大致说来，贵族和寺院各占有全西藏土地的百分之三十左右，其余的百分之四十左右属于封建政府。
    建筑在这样反动的、黑暗的、残酷的、野蛮的农奴制基础上的西藏政教中枢，当然就是一小撮最大的农奴主的集合体。在这些最大的农奴主中间，不可避免地要产生各种可怕的腐败现象和内部斗争。在达赖喇嘛周围的一部分掌握权力的高级官员中，为了争权夺利互相残杀毒毙的事件层出不穷。达赖喇嘛，并不是像尼赫鲁所说的那样，无条件地被这些人非常崇敬；相反，这些人经常把达赖喇嘛当作傀儡，把自己的意见强加于他，在他们认为必要的时候，甚至把达赖喇嘛本人活活害死。例如，人们知道，1855年，达赖十一世只在十八岁的时候就在布达拉宫暴亡；随后，1875年，达赖十二世又在二十岁的时候在布达拉宫暴亡。英帝国主义侵入西藏以后，西藏上层反动统治者倾轧异己的手段，也更加卑鄙和残酷了。1923年，班禅九世被迫终身逃亡内地；1947年，担任了八年摄政的热振呼图克图被逮捕并勒毙狱中；同年，现在穆索里的达赖十四世的父亲，也因为具有爱国思想，被里通外国的反动分子为了便于控制达赖而毒死；1950年，致力于和平解放西藏的格达活佛，在昌都被毒死和焚尸灭迹。这些著名的罪行，都是西藏统治集团中外国干涉者的走狗干的。
    这个社会过去确是停滞不前的，不但经济衰敝，文化落后，连人口也不能增殖。但是，这个社会的制度丝毫也不“温和”，丝毫也不“人道”！这个社会制度是一个十足的落后、反动、残酷、野蛮的制度！
    试问世界上一切大吵大闹的所谓西藏人民的同情者：你们同情的“西藏人民”是谁呢？你们所宣传的西藏的自治或“独立”是谁的自治或独立呢？你们痛哭哀悼的西藏叛乱的失败是谁的失败呢？看起来，很多所谓“同情者”只是假冒西藏人民之名，假冒西藏自治之名，假冒人道之名。他们所同情的并不是西藏人民，而是西藏人民的世世代代的压迫者、剥削者、残杀者，而是西藏的吃人制度的首脑。在西藏的大农奴主剜出农奴的眼睛和心脏来的时候，这些同情专家不觉得是悲剧，不向这些农奴主要求温和和人道。在这些大农奴主向驻守在自己国土上的人民解放军举行武力进攻的时候，在他们用野蛮的方法残杀被他们俘虏的解放军战士和人民政府的工作人员的时候，同情家们只是叫“打得好”，只是鼓吹这些农奴主能够进行百年的游击战争，也不向他们要求温和和人道。而唯有在人民解放军对于这些坚持叛乱的豺狼由防御转入进攻的时候，也就是说，唯有在这个世界上最残酷最野蛮的农奴制度由于武装匪徒的叛乱的失败而最后遭遇着危机的时候，一切什么悲剧呀、同情呀、人道呀、自治呀、独立呀的叫喊，就像潮水冲破了闸门一样地泛滥起来了。由此可见，进行这种叫喊的人们，除了有一些是出于误会以外，根本是最反动的农奴制度和最野蛮的大农奴主的卫士，根本是西藏人民自由解放的敌人。也正因为这样，这个梅特涅（注）式的反革命的“神圣同盟”才会把美国国务院、英国殖民主义者、南朝鲜李承晚、南越吴庭艳、中国蒋介石和印度的反动党派人民社会党、人民同盟联系在一起。这有什么奇怪呢？
    （注：克勒曼特·梅特涅从1809到1848年先后担任奥地利帝国的外交大臣和首相。
    1815年俄国的沙皇、奥地利帝国的皇帝和普鲁士的国王为了共同镇压当时欧洲的资产阶级革命运动，签订了一个同盟条约，结成了所谓“神圣同盟”。后来，欧洲各国的君主都参加了这个同盟。梅特涅是这个“神圣同盟”的组织者和领导人。）
    我们感到惊异的是印度总理尼赫鲁先生，一方面显然跟这个同盟中的许多肮脏人物存在着重要的矛盾，懂得他们所玩弄的不利于印度、不利于中印友好、不利于尼赫鲁自己的阴谋诡计，另一方面却不由自主地被这个同盟推到他们的所谓“同情”西藏运动的重要地位，而让他们坐山观虎斗，拍手称快。我们现在被迫在自己的评论中同尼赫鲁先生有所争辩，这是我们非常难过的事。尼赫鲁先生是我们尊敬的友好邻邦印度的总理，是世界上有威望的政治家之一。对于我们来说，尤其不能忘记的是，他是一位中国的友人，一位帝国主义的战争政策和侵略政策的反对者。而且，他对于社会进步，也曾经发表过不少开明的言论。例如，他在1934—1935年在狱中所写的“自传”一书中，尽管对共产主义表现很多误解和偏见（他自己也说，他是“典型的资产阶级”，带着在资产阶级环境的“熏陶中所养成的一切偏见”），但是他仍然承认，由于用科学方法研究过去的历史和当前的时事，“马克思主义的作家对今天世界上发生的变化做出了最精辟、最深刻的分析”。他并且说：“经济利益形成各团体和各阶级的政治观点。理智或道德的看法都不能超越这种利益。个人可以接受感化，可以放弃特殊的权利，虽然这是少有的事情，但阶级和团体却不会这样。因此，感化一个统治的特权阶级使它放弃它的权力和特权，这样的企图一直是失败的，似乎也没有什么理由说将来能够成功。”尼赫鲁在这里说得很对。但是，他在1959年4月27日的讲话中却唱着一种多末不同的调子！他或者是完全抛弃了他以前发表过的见解，或者是实际上没有了解他所曾以为了解过的马克思主义的科学方法。他现在责备我们没有能够感化统治西藏的特权阶级使它放弃权力和特权，而且企图把对于西藏社会的阶级分析作为“颇为陈腐的字眼、措辞和口号”一笔勾消，把极端对立的农奴和农奴主这样两个阶级，描写成为“担心可能会在改革的名义下对自己采取什么行动”的一个单一的社会！当然，尼赫鲁的这个企图是我们所无法同意的。西藏社会的阶级对立是一个活生生的事实，根本不是什么字眼、措辞、口号的问题，更谈不到什么陈腐。改革当然要采取行动，当然要有利于绝大多数要求改革的人，只是不利于极少数坚决反对改革的人。在西藏的情况下，改革首先就是要有利于占人口百分之九十五的一百十四万人。其余占人口百分之五的六万人，这里面也有种种不同的情况。坚决反对改革、直至举行叛乱和死不悔改的，只是其中的极少数。我们已经说过，两万左右的叛匪大部分是被裹胁欺骗的劳动人民（任何反革命军队都是如此），如果除去其中三分之一左右的康巴人，那么，参加叛乱的西藏人只占西藏一百二十万人的百分之一多一点。以为整个西藏上层阶级都叛变了的想法是不正确的。而且，在这六万人中还有相当一部分赞成改革的开明人士。因此对于上层阶级也必须分别情况，适当对待，这是我们所一向坚持的政策。如果说，上面说的这些不同情况的人对于改革都是同样担心的，在心理上和感情上都是同样有障碍的，那是不合乎实际的。至于要求改革的绝大多数人，他们对于改革有什么要担心，有什么心理上感情上的障碍呢？
    尼赫鲁在讨论西藏社会的时候，虽然并不反对改革，也不否认既得利益集团在叛乱中的作用，但是整个说来，他不但没有涉及这个社会的极端残酷的剥削制度，而且实际上把极大多数被剥削者和极少数剥削者混为一谈，并且在这个基础上否认西藏叛乱要由少数上层反动分子负责，把中国人民平定叛乱的正义行动说成是“悲剧”，对于叛乱表示同情。这样，他就犯了一个极可惋惜的错误。作为印度的朋友，作为尼赫鲁所讨论的问题的当事人，我们认为，指出这个错误是必要的。如果同意尼赫鲁的逻辑，那么，不但西藏的革命是不能允许的，整个中国的革命也是不能允许的。大家记得，中国汉族地区在解放前虽然不是农奴制度，但是基本上也没有脱离封建社会的范围。这个社会也是一向被称为停滞不前的、没有变化的、与世隔绝的社会。有些人也曾经讥笑我们是从陈腐的、过时的、极端简单化的和完全不合国情的外来思想——马克思列宁主义出发，断言我们的改革运动将受到整个社会整个民族的抵抗，甚至宣布我们是分裂民族，背叛祖国，是听命于莫斯科的所谓“赤色帝国主义”的代理人，等等，等等。现在历史已经作出结论：正确的是我们而不是他们。所有对于共产主义者的种种攻击和诽谤，一概都彻底地破产了。停滞不前的、没有变化的中国，在无产阶级领导之下，一变而为生气勃勃、迅速前进的中国，证明马克思列宁主义的分析是放诸四海而皆准的。过去的停滞不前，不过是因为生产力的发展受到落后的生产关系的束缚罢了。马克思列宁主义者、共产主义者才真正代表了民族的利益和祖国的利益，而那一小撮自称为代表全民族利益的反共分子，尽管也曾暂时迷惑过一部分群众，却真正被证明为帝国主义的代理人。我们相信，中国历史的这个结论，尼赫鲁总理也是不至于反对的。但是按照尼赫鲁在西藏问题上的逻辑，只要他的同情不仅仅限于“西藏人民”，而扩大到整个“中国人民”，那么，整个中国革命也就要变成为令人百倍难过的空前的大“悲剧”了。在中国人民解放战争时期，蒋介石的国民党和国民党军队比西藏的两万左右叛匪多得多，说他们不止是“上层反动分子”的“理由”也多得多，战争的规模也大得多，总之，值得引起的“同情”也应该强烈得多。但是，据我们所知，尼赫鲁总理在同情整个中国的时候，并没有同情于汉族的“大农奴主”；而在同情中国的一部分——西藏的时候，却同情于西藏的“小蒋介石”。这种极端的矛盾，究竟令人如何理解呢？
    尼赫鲁先生可能说我们不公正，因为他所讲的只限于西藏，而西藏人和汉人是不同的。这就是说，汉人在西藏人中间领导革命，将不可避免地遇到民族的障碍。西藏人和汉人不同，千真万确。不但如此，蒙古族人、维吾尔族人、僮族人、回族人、苗族人、朝鲜族人，以及中国的其他许多少数民族，也都和汉人不同。在中国共产主义者和中国政府面前，存在着国内的少数民族问题。我们是十分谨慎地对待这个问题的。我们用了近十年的时间，培养了各少数民族自己的干部，并且在汉族人民中，特别是在汉族干部、共产党的汉族党员和人民解放军的汉族官兵中，认真地进行了反对大汉族主义的教育。我们采取了资本主义世界上没有先例的办法，在汉人占人口多数的民族杂居地区说服汉人，建立了少数民族的自治区。例如内蒙古自治区、广西僮族自治区、宁夏回族自治区和其他的一些自治州、自治县，就是这样建立起来的。在西藏，为了争取西藏上层分子的合作，我们用了特别大的耐心，在和平解放了八年之久的时间里，一直保存着原来的西藏地方政府，它的一套制度、它的军队甚至它的货币，一直说服西藏人民暂时不要进行他们所迫切要求的改革。如果中央人民政府像所谓达赖喇嘛声明所说，不给原西藏地方政府任何自治的权利，那么，那些叛国有据的反动分子早就会被逮捕惩处，西藏的民主改革也不会拖延到现在了。中央人民政府对那些反动分子采取了如此仁至义尽的态度，甚至在拉萨叛乱爆发以后，甚至在知道达赖喇嘛已经被劫出拉萨以后，人民解放军西藏军区的部队还是一直等到叛匪向军区直接发动了武装攻击的七小时以后，才开始举行还击。很明显，到了这一步，反动分子已经把和平解决的路都堵死了，除了坚决讨伐和平定叛乱以外，任何其他的办法都没有可能了。人民解放军既然有力量迅速平定拉萨地区的叛乱，如果它愿意先下手，当然早就可以把罗布林卡包围起来，使叛匪无法劫走达赖喇嘛。每个明白事理的人稍微想一想，都会懂得这个道理，而决不会去理睬什么两三发炮弹打向宫殿、落入池塘的童话。中央人民政府和人民解放军面对着这种严重局面，始终坚持不打第一枪的方针，正是说明了共产党人对待民族问题始终是很慎重的，对于争取西藏上层分子尤其尽了最大的努力。这种政策，只有革命的无产阶级才能认真执行，资产阶级或者其他剥削阶级就是想要这样作，也是作不到的。
    在这里，在民族关系问题上，根本的关键仍然是阶级分析的方法问题。尼赫鲁先生希望我们“争取他们友好合作”，这无疑是一个好的主意，虽然尼赫鲁先生的意思是为了间接地指责我们过去和现在没有这样作。事实上，只有革命的无产阶级才能彻底地正确地解决历史上的民族问题。民族之间的纠纷和隔阂，基本上是剥削阶级造成的，剥削阶级也永远不可能消除这种现象。但是各民族的劳动人民，在革命的无产阶级的正确领导之下，完全能够通过一定的努力，消除历史上遗留下来的一切纠纷和隔阂，结成兄弟般的融洽的友谊。中国历史上有过长时期的民族压迫和民族斗争。蒙古统治者和满洲统治者压迫过汉人、维吾尔人和西藏人，而汉族统治者也压迫过蒙古人、满洲人、维吾尔人和西藏人。在无产阶级领导的中华人民共和国成立以后，情况就根本改变了。占人口绝大多数并且是革命主力的汉人，现在仍然需要派遣一部分人员到内蒙古去，到新疆去，到西藏去，但是，现在不是去压迫和剥削那里的少数民族，而是跟当地民族的革命干部在一起，帮助那里的劳动人民从本民族的压迫者、剥削者手中获得自由和解放，实现民主和社会主义，也就是说，建立使各少数民族的经济和文化繁荣昌盛起来的基础。在这些地区工作的共产主义的汉族人员，包括人民解放军的汉族官兵，不但没有骑在少数民族人民的头上摆威风，相反，他们是跟当地民族的革命干部一道，做少数民族人民的勤务员。他们常常不避艰险，同少数民族的劳动人民同甘共苦，为他们的权利和幸福而斗争。这样，各少数民族的劳动人民，以及各少数民族的一切爱国的、赞成改革的上中层分子，就同汉族的劳动人民联合一致，像汉族人民一样地推翻了他们本民族的上层反动分子的反动统治。这样，各民族的纠纷和隔阂的根源就消灭了，各民族的友好合作就获得了真正巩固的基础。这个过程，在内蒙古，在新疆，在西北的宁夏、甘肃、青海，在西南的四川、贵州、云南、广西，都已经实现了。在这个过程中，领导改革的人员都竭力团结各少数民族的赞成改革的各阶层人士，在改革以前、改革中间和改革以后都同他们保持密切的合作。诚然，不可能没有斗争，而四川、甘肃和青海的藏族地区还曾经发生了武装叛乱。但是，如我们在别的地方已经指出过的，这些藏族地区的叛乱，正是由西藏的反动分子利用他们的特殊地位指使和煽动起来的。
    在西藏，由于那里的大农奴主的统治在和平解放的过程中没有受到变动，他们仍然能够利用合法地位指挥保卫农奴制度的旧藏军、康巴叛匪和其他反动的政治机构，并且继续跟一些外国干涉者相勾结。因为这样，在那里不但没有进行改革，而且还能够发动这一次的叛乱。但是，即使如此，从人民解放军进驻西藏以来，西藏人民仍然是屡次三番地热烈地要求改革。水深火热中的西藏人民所担心的不是改革，他们担心的倒是中央人民政府过于迁就西藏的大农奴主，而一年又一年地拖延改革！世界上的人道主义者诸君须知：西藏的农奴也是人，要他们相信那些无情地勒索他们、鞭打他们、挖出他们的眼睛的魔鬼是他们的保护人，是不可能的；要他们相信那些帮助他们劳动和治病、不取他们一针一线的解放军战士是他们的仇敌，是不可能的。这就是这次叛乱尽管打着民族旗号和宗教旗号，尽管有高山深沟的地形，尽管有各种名目的外国援助，却完全得不到西藏人民支持，转瞬之间就被打得落花流水的根本原因。西藏人民对于平定叛乱的人民解放军收缴了封建政府的官印，收缴了叛匪的枪枝，收缴了农奴主的刑具“法鞭”，普遍感到久旱逢甘雨一般地高兴，这三样东西把他们压迫得太惨了！他们给解放军自动带路，自动报告匪情，自动协助捕捉残匪，搜查枪枝。只是在拉萨人民法院一处，就接收了群众自动收缴来的枪几百枝。在山南，许多村庄的居民听说解放军要来，马上聚集起来向战士献哈达，献鲜红的桃花和嫩绿的柳枝，同时向解放军哭诉叛匪奸淫掳掠杀人放火的罪行，要求解放军一定要替他们报仇。贡噶宗的叛匪曾在公路上挖了四条横沟阻挡解放军前进，但是叛匪一走，当地居民马上把壕沟填平。解放军一到林芝，当地的群众马上自动组成一支骡马运输队，帮助解放军运送弹药粮草，并且跟随解放军一道追剿残匪。这种感动人的例子是说不完的。叛乱一平，广大群众很快协助人民政府恢复秩序，很快在人民政府协助下转入生产。山南的春耕虽然因为叛匪骚扰推迟了半个月，但是，在解放军的帮助下，播种期并没有延长。那里成群的人正在地里送粪、播种，整修渠道，并且唱出了多久没有唱过的欢乐的歌声。农民们纷纷询问什么时候分配土地。在根据群众要求，宣布叛乱头目的土地今年实行谁种谁收以后，劫持达赖喇嘛的主犯之一大农奴主索康·旺清格勒在开苏溪卡的农奴，马上自动把所有劳动力组织成为劳动互助小组，共同耕种所有的土地，争取丰收。很明显，西藏的农民们相信，他们在西藏的土地上翻身作主的日子不久就要到来了。很抱歉，我们在这里的话说得太长了一点……但是，关心西藏的一切善良的人们请看，这一切跟清朝以来的旧式中国军队进驻西藏的时候所遇到的景象多么不同！跟英国侵略军由印度攻入拉萨的时候所遇到的景象多么相反！试问：怎么能够把人民解放军跟西藏人民在一起平定杀人放火、无恶不作的叛匪的正义行动，描写成为民族镇压和民族侵略呢？
    尼赫鲁先生断言，汉族社会和藏族社会两者之间很难有任何会合点，冲破双方心理上感情上的障碍的尝试不是没有作，就是作了没有成功。对于西藏的劳动人民，这个问题现在已经由事实作了答复，而且将来还会作出更大量更生动的答复。就是对于藏族的上层分子，他们中间许多人的心理上感情上的障碍，也已经在不同程度上起了变化。达赖喇嘛在被劫持的情况下完全自发地、秘密地写给谭冠三将军的三封信，和班禅额尔德尼、阿沛·阿旺晋美、喜饶嘉错、阿旺嘉错、黄正清等人在人民代表大会上的讲话，就是这一方面的显著证明的一部分。站在西藏自治区筹备委员会方面的，有大批西藏的爱国的上中层分子。拉萨的中小学的学生，大都是上中层分子的子女，叛乱一结束就来上学，而且人数比叛乱以前大大增加。可见，断言叛乱是民族性的“革命”，叛乱的平定是民族性的“悲剧”，是没有根据的。
    有一些对中国并无恶意的印度朋友，由于受了长时间的有偏见的宣传的影响，由于他们没有直接看见西藏社会生活和人民解放军活动的真相，而他们的报纸又很少发表中国方面的完整的资料，一时误解中国的立场和政策，这是有可能的。但是，事实胜于雄辩，水落自然石出。我们完全相信，那些暂时有所误解的、对于我们现在所说的话仍然将信将疑的印度朋友们，终会得出客观的结论来的。我们希望，尼赫鲁先生也是他们中间的一个。当然，尼赫鲁先生有很大的自信，他有一套对于西藏问题的独立的见解。他倾向于假定原西藏地方政府的有势力集团是一群纯洁的羔羊，因而甚至在他们向我们发动进攻，仍然是我们不对。我们不能要求我们的外国朋友对于中国的事情一定要跟我们一样看，我们更不能要求尼赫鲁先生一定要改变他的哲学的、历史的、政治的观点。在尼赫鲁先生的思想中，显然是存在着矛盾的，但是，我们不打算讨论应当怎样解决这些矛盾。在这类问题上，我们固然可以进行友好的辩论，也完全可以不辩论。大家家里的事情都很多，各人自扫门前雪就够忙了，何必多管他家瓦上霜呢？尼赫鲁先生在北京的时候说得好：“要把一个国家的意愿强加在另一个国家的头上，或者要把一国人民的生活方式强加在另一国人民的头上，任何这种尝试一定会产生冲突，危及和平。”但是，现在的问题是，一批印度人，其中不幸也有尼赫鲁先生，一定要我们按照他们的主张办事。我们是很好的朋友和邻人，你走你的阳关道，我走我的独木桥，不是完全可以相安无事吗？你的办法如果在印度行得好，那么我们再向你学习也还不迟。究竟有什么必要像现在这样地迫不及待，甚至不惜采取某种妨碍友好的干涉行为，这是我们所百思而不得其解的。
    尼赫鲁总理否认印度曾经干涉西藏。他追述了印度独立和分治前后的情况，证明印度对西藏从来“没有政治的或者不可告人的野心”。我们承认，尼赫鲁的话，在这样的意义上是合乎实际的，这就是说，印度政府不打算吞并西藏，或者派遣武力来干涉西藏的事务。印度始终承认：西藏是中国的一部分，中国政府享有对于西藏的主权。印度在1954年4月同中国签订了以五项原则为基础的关于中国西藏地方和印度之间的通商和交通协定，并且随后从西藏撤出了自己的部队，移交了印度的邮电设施。这些都是中国人民认为满意的。但是一个国家对另一个国家的内政的干涉，方式可以有多种多样。要说印度政府对中国的西藏过去和现在根本没有任何方式的干涉，那是不能令人信服的。
    人们记得，本报也公布过，1950年10月中国政府命令自己的部队进入西藏的时候，印度政府就曾经经由外交途径进行干涉。当时，中国政府在下令进军西藏的同时，曾要求西藏地方政府派代表前来北京谈判。这完全是中国主权范围内的内政问题。但是，印度政府却在1950年10月21日、10月28日、11月1日三次照会中国政府，说“中国军队之侵入西藏不得不被认为是可悲叹的”，是“没有理由的”，说这对印度政府“是最为惊异和遗憾的”。照会中还提出，中国军队进驻自己的领土西藏，“将使对中国不友好的那些国家在这一国际事务紧急和微妙关头，有借口来进行反华宣传”；在联合国恢复中国代表权的问题上“将会引起严重后果，并将使那些反对人民政府参加联合国和安全理事会的国家获得有力的支持”；“会使中国的地位在世界人士心目中产生偏见”；会使中央人民政府同西藏地方政府的“和平谈判就难于与此同时进行”；将不“符合中国或和平的利益”；“已经大大地增加了世界的紧张形势和导向大战的趋势”；“已经影响到”印度与中国的“友谊关系以及全世界和平的利益”。对此，中国政府在答复印度政府的照会中曾经指出，人民解放军进军西藏是行使国家主权，西藏问题是中国的内政，任何外国的干涉都是不容许的。这个问题跟中华人民共和国在联合国的代表权问题，是完全不相干的两件事；如果那些对中国不友好的国家竟然利用联合国的代表权问题威胁中国不得在自己的领土上行使主权，那只是再一次表示这些国家对中国的敌对态度罢了。在中国政府一再坚决地表示了这种严正的态度之后，特别是在人民解放军在昌都地区取得了歼灭企图阻挡进军西藏的藏军主力的重大胜利以后，滞留印度的西藏地方政府的谈判代表团才在1951年4月下旬到达北京。经过谈判，终于在同年5月达成了关于和平解放西藏的十七条协议。
    重提这一段经过，可能是不愉快的。但是事实终究是事实。怎么能说，印度政府从来没有干涉过西藏呢？
    不幸的是，这种干涉仍在以某种形式继续着。这种干涉发生在中印两国政府联合声明以和平共处五项原则为指导两国关系的原则之后，就不能不令人更为遗憾了。就以尼赫鲁总理本人来说，他在西藏叛乱发生后发表过的声明和谈话，其中虽有不少友好的表示，但是有些话我们觉得不能认为是符合和平共处五项原则的。例如，他说，“北京没有遵守西藏同中国关于西藏自治地区的协议和对印度提出的保证。那里发生了武装干涉”（4月13日）。“我衷心希望西藏人民将能维持并且享受他们的自治，而不受其他人的压迫和镇压”（4月14日）。试问：把中国对于自己的一个地方发生的叛乱实行平定称为“武装干涉”，称为“压迫和镇压”他们的“自治”，并且说什么没有遵守“对印度提出的保证”，这一切怎么能说不是干涉呢？印度政府坚持说达赖喇嘛不是被叛乱分子劫持的，而是叛乱分子的领袖，既然如此，印度政府对于达赖喇嘛的隆重欢迎和尼赫鲁总理本人到穆索里的访问，岂不意味着对于一个友好国家的叛乱领袖的欢迎和会商么？由于印度政府始终没有明确执行不干涉的政策，人们就不难理解，为什么执政的国大党主席甘地夫人和国大党总书记克里帕拉尼夫人都宣称西藏是一个“国家”或者“自治国家”，包括国大党在内的印度多数政党组织的“支援西藏人民委员会”公然要求把西藏问题提交联合国，印度的报刊公然污蔑中国政府“采取强盗行径和实行帝国主义”，污辱中国国家元首是“可恶的雪人”，并且要求召开有所谓印度、西藏和中国三方面参加的另一次西姆拉会议（注）式的会议来解决纯属中国内政的西藏问题。西藏叛乱发生以后，甚至在这以前，印度的一些政界人物和一些报刊就展开了一个诽谤中国的运动，规模之大，使人想起美国政界和报界对于古巴处决反革命罪犯的干涉。试问，对于一个友好国家的内政采取这种施加政治压力的方法，难道能说是符合五项原则吗？
    （注）西姆拉会议是1913年10月在印度北部的西姆拉召开的所谓“中英藏会议”。这次会议是英帝国主义侵略西藏的重要阴谋。参加会议的，有英国代表印度殖民政府的外务大臣麦克马洪，西藏代表伦兴香托拉，袁世凯政府的代表西藏宣抚使陈贻范。
    英国代表一手把持西姆拉会议，在会上提出一个所谓解决西藏问题的方案，其主要内容包括：“中国政府承认西藏有完全自治权，不得改为行省”；“中国政府除西藏办事长官的卫队外，不得驻兵藏境”；“中国政府与西藏有争议时，由印度政府判决之”；“英国人得在西藏自由经商，中国政府不得加以限制”以及“西藏内政暂由印度政府监督，英国政府得派代表常驻拉萨”等等。很显然，英国提出这个方案的目的是要使西藏从中国分裂出去，由英国在印度的殖民政府统治西藏，奴役西藏人民。因此，这个方案遭到中国人民的坚决反对，连当时的袁世凯政府也拒绝接受。
     尼赫鲁总理说，印度对于西藏问题的反应实质上不是政治性的而是本能的，它主要是一种基于情感和人道原因的同情，也基于同西藏人民久远的宗教和文化联系所造成的亲密感情。我们了解，印度人民对于中国的西藏人民具有亲密感情；不但如此，印度人民对于整个中国人民也具有亲密感情。周恩来总理访问印度的时候，到处听到“印度人中国人是兄弟”的热烈口号，此情此景，恍如昨日。对于西藏人民的感情，怎么能被用来作为一些政界人士损害对中国人民的感情和干涉中国内政的理由呢？这种逻辑具有一种显然的危险，因为，如果这样的逻辑是可以成立的话，那末，在西藏走上了民主的社会主义的繁荣强盛的道路之后，是不是也可以用久远的宗教和文化联系为理由，组织什么“支援阿萨姆邦人民委员会”、什么“北方邦事务委员会”，来干涉印度的阿萨姆邦或者北方邦的事务呢？西藏自治区政府以及整个中国政府，是否也可以把对于阿萨姆邦人民或者北方邦人民的深切同情宣布为一项基本政策，并且根据这种政策对那些邦的事务指手划脚呢？如果印度政府可以用对西藏人民的深切同情和悠久联系为理由，要求中国政府给予印度某种保证，那么，印度政府不是也可以干脆用对全中国人民的深切同情和悠久联系为理由，要求中国政府对全部内政给予印度某种保证吗？同样，中国政府不是也可以用对印度人民的深切同情和悠久联系为理由，要求印度政府对自己的内政给予中国某种保证吗？那还有什么和平共处，什么五项原则可言呢？世界不是就陷在互相干涉的混乱中吗？我们相信，我们的印度朋友一定跟我们一样，不会欢迎而且也无法容忍这样一种国际秩序的。
    把印度方面前后两次对于中国西藏的干涉联系起来，人们不难看出，印度政府虽然不打算占领西藏，或者使西藏正式独立，但是的确力图阻挠中国在自己的领土西藏行使完全的主权。印度的一些政界人士在这一方面继承过去英国政府的传统：只承认中国对西藏的所谓“宗主权”，有如印度对于不丹和锡金的“宗主权”。他们所谓的西藏“自治”，不同于中国宪法上所明文规定的民族区域自治，不同于内蒙古、新疆、广西、宁夏等地的民族区域自治，而是一种半独立状态。不错，西藏不是一个省，而是中华人民共和国的一个自治区，它比省具有宪法和法律所规定的更多的权限，但是它决不是什么保护国——既不是中国的保护国，也不是印度的保护国，也不是中印两国共同的保护国，也不是中印两国之间的什么缓冲国。中华人民共和国对于西藏地方享有完全的主权，跟对于内蒙古、新疆、广西、宁夏等地方享有完全的主权一样，这是丝毫不容怀疑的，这是丝毫不容任何外国或者联合国以任何名义任何形式干涉的。因此，西藏的任何问题，都只能由中国解决，在中国解决，而不能在任何外国去解决。西藏的任何半独立状态不利于西藏人民，不利于全中国人民，不利于印度人民，不利于中印友好和亚洲和平，而仅仅有利于西藏的卖国的、反动的大农奴主和支持这伙卖国的、反动的大农奴主的外国干涉者，仅仅有利于那些企图在中印两国之间制造纠纷的扩张主义分子和帝国主义阴谋家。中印两国是两个爱好和平并且有悠久友谊的国家，我们两国有一千种理由要和睦相处，互不侵犯，互不干涉，而没有任何一种理由要互相冲突，要设什么缓冲地区；如果硬要设，那就恰恰是要制造本来不存在的真正可悲叹的冲突了。鉴于印度政府在这个问题上的态度，鉴于印度一些并非不负责的人士的言论，我们认为，彻底澄清这一点，对于巩固中印友谊是十分必要的。尼赫鲁总理在4月27日讲话中提及五项原则的时候，只说到“互相尊重”（这无疑是必要的），而没有说“互相尊重领土完整和主权”（这是五项原则的原话，而且是任何互相尊重的前提）。我们希望，这不过是一种疏忽。
    印度的一些政界人士对中国内政的干涉，不是一种偶然的现象。它带有时代的特征。印度是一个摆脱英帝国主义殖民统治而获得独立的国家，它要求在和平的国际环境中发展民族经济，同帝国主义和殖民主义势力存在着深刻的矛盾。这是一方面。另一方面，印度的大资产阶级同帝国主义又有千丝万缕的联系，对外国资本有一定程度的依赖性。而且，大资产阶级的阶级本性，也决定了它的某种向外扩张的欲望。这就使它在反对帝国主义干涉政策的同时，又或多或少地有意无意地反映某些帝国主义干涉政策的影响。在国际事务中，以尼赫鲁总理为首的印度政府，在反对战争、维护和平、反对殖民主义的问题上，在执行对中国友好、对苏联和其他社会主义国家友好、不参加美帝国主义的军事集团的外交政策上，一般地反映了印度人民的意志，起了并且继续起着重要的、受人尊敬的作用。但是，由于历史的原因，印度大资产阶级却继承着而且企图继续保持英国殖民统治者所留下的某些遗产。当然，伟大的印度人民对于印度资产阶级的这种两面性不负任何责任。我们也相信，不但印度人民，而且印度政府中的一切有远见的明智的人士，都承认印度的出路是在进步方面，是在向前看，而不是向后看。我们跟他们一样地认为，一个不久前才获得独立、而现在也还受着帝国主义干涉者威胁的国家的当局，竟然干涉自己邻国的事务，这是现代国际政治中一种令人惋惜的现象。
    我们同尼赫鲁先生可以有这样那样的意见分歧，但是在这一点上大概是没有分歧的，就是中国并没有干涉印度的内政。中国人民只是在印度方面发出了大量的污蔑性的言论之后才开始回击的。尼赫鲁总理在4月27日的讲话中正当地谴责了某些印度人的旨在破坏中印友好关系的言行。可惜他随即集中力量攻击中国的反干涉言论。他说，“中国的负责人物对印度所作的评论和指责”，是“不顾事实真相和礼节，使用了冷战的语言”。但是，中国指责印度方面的干涉是有事实根据的，已如上述。中国舆论界怀疑所谓达赖声明的真实性，也是有事实根据的，这个声明中的大量漏洞和冒名顶替的痕迹，现在仍然是客观地存在着。很明显，那些把达赖喇嘛劫到印度的西藏反动分子跟那些长期以来聚集在噶伦堡进行叛国活动的西藏反动分子在一起，正在竭力利用所谓达赖喇嘛的声明，来堵塞达赖喇嘛回到祖国的道路，而这是跟尼赫鲁总理多次表示的愿望不相符的。
    说到重视事实真相和礼节，我们感到遗憾的是，印度的一些政界人物和一些报刊，在过去一个多月中对中国所说的很多话，决不能认为合乎事实和礼节。我国人民注意到，尼赫鲁总理在这一方面不止一次地起了节制作用，这无疑是有益于中印友好的。但是，我们究竟不能说，在他指责中国中央人民政府破坏十七条协议、提出所谓中国对印度的“保证”等等的时候，他的话也是合乎事实真相和礼节的。至于说到冷战的语言，那么，印度的一些政界人士和报刊，咒骂中国是“新的和凶恶的帝国主义”、“扩张帝国主义”，攻击中国平定西藏叛乱是“军事干涉”，“殖民行动”，“强盗行径”，所有这些，难道不正是“冷战的语言”吗？对于这类“冷战的语言”，我们在一个相当长的时间内一忍再忍，作了最大限度的克制，我们的报纸几乎守口如瓶。人们记得，直到4月18日，周恩来总理还在第二届全国人民代表大会上发出维护中印友好的热诚呼吁。但是令人痛心的是，这一切所换来的却是对于所谓达赖喇嘛声明的大事宣扬，却是对于我国政府和我国人民的更放肆的攻击。退无可退了，我们不得不起而反击。有人企图用“言论自由”来为印度的反华诽谤运动辩解。但是他们为什么不想一想，难道中国人就不要言论自由吗？西藏是我国的领土，西藏问题是我国的内政，外国人尚且可以有所谓本能的反应，我国人民反而会没有本能的反应吗？现在，某些外国对于我们的诽谤运动似乎已经趋于低落了，理智正在重占上风，但是也还有极少数人企图继续扇风放火。可以正告这些人：你们的反华诽谤运动一天不停，我们的反击就一天不止。你们愿意用多长的时间我们就准备付出多长的时间，而且还准备着你们煽动别的国家来对我们进行围攻，也准备着在你们后面还有世界上一切帝国主义分子的助威。但是，想用任何压力来干涉中国内政，来挽救西藏大农奴主的穷凶极恶的统治，那是毫无希望的。世界上一切反共反华的人们对于我们越骂得凶，就越能暴露他们的真面目，也就越能教育全世界人民。
    如前所说，现在世界上议论西藏问题的人很多，他们的出发点也有许多不同。尼赫鲁总理跟许多对中国显然怀有恶意的人们不同，他跟我们在西藏问题上有某些分歧，但是在总的方面，他是主张中印友好的，对于这一点，我们没有任何怀疑。我们所以对于尼赫鲁总理的指责作这样详细的答复（当然在文章里也有不少地方涉及了那些对我们显然怀有恶意的人），正是因为，我们怀有充分的信念：分歧是可以缩小的，争论是可以解决的。诚然，争论是有些尖锐，因为这是我们祖国和西藏人民的切身利益所在。但是我们仍然希望，我们的争论从本质上能够有益于两国人民的相互了解，有益于两国人民和两国政府的友好，并且在语言上也能够没有疏忽了友谊和礼貌。我们完全同意尼赫鲁总理的一些语重心长的、对中国人民十分亲切的话。他说，“我们非常希望保持印度和中国之间的友谊。”“如果印度和中国这两个亚洲的伟大国家，这两个过去世世代代一直是和睦的邻邦的国家竟然彼此产生了敌对情绪，这将是一个悲剧。”中印友好是有悠久历史和深厚基础的，我们的基本利益相同，我们的主要敌人也相同，我们决不会忘记我们的共同利益，而落入我们的共同敌人的圈套。这次的争论虽然令人遗憾，但是我们坚决相信，它不会造成敌对情绪，它不会动摇我们两国的友谊。尼赫鲁总理宣布：印度一点也不想干涉西藏。我们热烈欢迎这个友好的声明。只要印度方面停止干涉西藏的言行，目前的争论就会随之结束。中国从来没有也永远不会干涉印度。我们还愿意郑重地告诉一切关心印度安全的全体印度爱国者：一个民主的、繁荣的、作为中国各族人民大家庭之一员的西藏自治区，必然会成为巩固和加强中印友好的因素，而决不会也决不可能成为对于印度共和国的什么“威胁”。社会主义中国的和平睦邻政策是永远不会动摇的，我们两国近十一亿人民的友谊是永远不会动摇的，就像喜马拉雅山的不会动摇一样，那些诽谤者的胡说八道是毫无根据的。在尼赫鲁总理1954年10月访问我国的时候，他曾经说：“中国和印度都是大国，面对着类似的问题，并且都已经坚决地走上前进的道路。这这两个国家彼此了解愈深，那末，不但亚洲的福利，而且全世界的福利就愈有保证。今天世界上存在的紧张局势，要求我们共同为和平而努力！”我们愿意两国人民永远记住尼赫鲁总理在这里所指出的真理。跟中国人民一样，伟大的印度人民是一贯珍惜中印两国的友谊的。我们深信，那些毒化中印关系的谰言，随着对于事实真相的了解，随着两国有关人士的共同努力，必将为印度广大人民所识破，所抛弃。中印两国和两国人民，将在和平建设的事业中继续友好合作，并将继续为亚洲和世界的和平而携手奋斗。
