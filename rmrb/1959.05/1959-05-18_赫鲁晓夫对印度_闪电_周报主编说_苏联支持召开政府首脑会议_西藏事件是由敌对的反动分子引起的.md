Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 17th: TASS reported from Moscow on the 16th: While talking with R.K. Karanjia, publisher and editor-in-chief of the Indian "Blitz" weekly, in Moscow on May 7th, Khrushchev said that considering the current situation, a peace treaty should be concluded with the two Germanies, and West Berlin should become a free city, with its internal affairs guaranteed against interference.

	Khrushchev said that our proposal on the German question is primarily based on the need to eliminate the remnants of the last war, ensure conditions for the peaceful development of Europe, and thereby make an important contribution to preventing a new war.

	Khrushchev pointed out that we believe that India correctly understands our position on the normalization of the Berlin situation and the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany, and we cherish this.

	Khrushchev supported the suggestion that heads of government hold regular meetings to discuss and resolve urgent issues. This suggestion was put forward by British Prime Minister Macmillan. Khrushchev said that this is a very valuable suggestion. We have always been in favor of holding such meetings and are willing to participate in all talks that would enable leaders of various countries to have a better understanding, thereby resolving urgent international issues peacefully.

	In response to questions about the recent Tibetan incident and the Hungarian incident in the autumn of 1956, the Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union said: Based on all the information known about the Tibetan incident, it is clear that this incident was caused by hostile reactionary elements who oppose everything new.

	Khrushchev continued, as for Hungary, we believe that the counter-revolutionary forces there were able to rise up, instigated by foreign forces, mainly due to the mistakes of the Hungarian leadership in the past. He added that what proves this is that Hungary has healed the wounds brought about by the counter-revolution in a short period of time, and now the Hungarian people have never been so closely united around their government and party.

    赫鲁晓夫对印度“闪电”周报主编说
    苏联支持召开政府首脑会议
    西藏事件是由敌对的反动分子引起的
    新华社17日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科16日讯：赫鲁晓夫5月7日在莫斯科同印度“闪电”周报发行人兼主编卡朗吉亚谈话时说，考虑到现实条件，应当同两个德国缔结和约，而西柏林应当变为自由城市，其内政应保证不受干涉。
    赫鲁晓夫说，我们提出关于德国问题的建议，首先是考虑必须消除上次战争的残余，保证欧洲和平发展的条件，从而对防止新战争作出重要贡献。
    赫鲁晓夫指出，我们认为，印度正确地理解到我们对于柏林局势正常化和缔结对德和约问题的立场，我们珍视这一点。
  赫鲁晓夫支持这样的建议：政府首脑定期举行会议，讨论并协商解决迫切问题。这项建议是英国首相麦克米伦提出来的。赫鲁晓夫说，这是一个很宝贵的建议。我们一向赞成举行这种会晤，并且愿意参加使各国领导人更好地了解，从而通过和平方式来解决迫切国际问题的一切会谈。
    在回答关于不久前的西藏事件和1956年秋天的匈牙利事件时，苏联部长会议主席说：就所知道的有关西藏事件的全部材料看来，很明显，这次事件是由反抗一切新事物的敌对的反动分子所引起的。
    赫鲁晓夫继续说，至于匈牙利，我们认为，那里受到外国唆使的反革命势力之所以能够抬头，主要是由于过去匈牙利领导的错误。他补充说，可以证实这点的是，在短短的期间内，匈牙利就治好了反革命所带来的创伤，现在匈牙利人民从来没有这样紧密地团结在自己的政府和党的周围。
