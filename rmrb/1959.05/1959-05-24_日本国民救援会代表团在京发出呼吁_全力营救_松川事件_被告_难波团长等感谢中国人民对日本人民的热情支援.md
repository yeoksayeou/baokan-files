Xinhua News Agency, 23rd. Namba Hideo, head of the Japanese National Relief Association delegation currently visiting China, said at a press conference today that the struggle to demand the acquittal of all innocent defendants in the "Matsukawa Incident" will surely achieve final victory with the strong movement of the Japanese people and the support of the Chinese people and the people of the world.

This delegation consists of six people, including Namba Hideo, Chief Defense Lawyer of the "Matsukawa Incident" Otsuka Kazuo, and Okada Toraharu, an innocent defendant in the "Matsukawa Incident" who has been acquitted in the second instance. The purpose of their visit to China is to express their gratitude for the support given by the Chinese people to the "Matsukawa Incident" struggle, and to exchange experiences with the China National Relief and Welfare Association on social welfare and social relief work.

Otsuka Kazuo, Chief Defense Lawyer of the "Matsukawa Incident," told reporters that since the "Matsukawa Incident" in which the US-Japan reactionaries fabricated to persecute the Japanese working class, he has been serving as the defendants' defense lawyer for the past ten years, fighting to secure the acquittal of all innocent defendants. He personally felt the encouragement and support given by the Chinese people in the "Matsukawa Incident" struggle.

Namba Hideo, the head of the delegation and acting chairman of the Japanese National Relief Association, said that the delegation was originally invited by the China National Relief and Welfare Association to visit China in the spring of 1958, but was unable to visit China as scheduled due to the obstruction of the Kishi Nobusuke government, which was implementing a policy of subservience to the United States and hostility towards China. Thanks to the continuous efforts and struggles of the Japanese people, they finally realized their wish to visit China.

Otsuka Kazuo said that we increasingly feel that the enemies who obstruct the normalization of Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations are also those who undermine the fair trial of the "Matsukawa Incident."

Otsuka pointed out in his speech that the significance of supporting the "Matsukawa Incident" struggle is by no means limited to securing the release of all innocent defendants. Striving for the final acquittal of the defendants is only the first step in the victory we want to achieve. The full significance of the Japanese people's support for the "Matsukawa Incident" struggle is to eliminate the political background and social background that produced this terrible fabricated persecution, and to investigate the masterminds who created the "Matsukawa Incident." Otsuka emphasized that the struggle to support the "Matsukawa Incident" is an important component of the Japanese people's national movement for independence, peace, and democracy.

    日本国民救援会代表团在京发出呼吁
    全力营救“松川事件”被告
    难波团长等感谢中国人民对日本人民的热情支援
    新华社23日讯　正在中国访问的日本国民救援会访华代表团团长难波英夫今天在记者招待会上说，要求无罪释放“松川事件”全体无辜被告的斗争，在日本人民展开强有力的运动以及中国和全世界人民的支援下一定能够取得最后胜利。
    这个代表团由难波英夫、“松川事件”主任辩护律师大冢一男以及在第二审中已被宣告无罪的“松川事件”无辜被告冈田十良松等六人组成。他们这次访华的目的是为了感谢中国人民对“松川事件”斗争给予的支援，并且就社会福利和社会救援工作和中国人民救济总会交流经验。
    “松川事件”主任辩护律师大冢一男对记者说，自从美日反动派制造迫害日本工人阶级的“松川事件”发生以来的十年间，他一直担任被告的辩护律师，为谋求全体无辜被告的无罪释放而进行斗争。他切身地感到中国人民在“松川事件”斗争中给予的鼓舞和支援。
    代表团团长、日本国民救援会代理会长难波英夫说，这个代表团去年应中国人民救济总会的邀请，本来应当在1958年春季到中国来访问，但是由于执行屈从美国和敌视中国政策的岸信介政府的多方阻挠，没有能够如期访问中国。由于日本人民的不断努力和进行了斗争，终于实现了访华的愿望。
    大冢一男说，我们越来越感到，阻碍中日邦交正常化的敌人，也就是那些破坏“松川事件”进行公正审判的人。
    大冢在谈话中指出，支援“松川事件”斗争的意义，绝不止于使全体无辜被告获得释放。争取最后判决无罪释放被告，只是我们要争取的胜利的第一步。日本人民展开支援“松川事件”斗争的全部意义是要消除产生这种可怕的捏造迫害事件的政治阴谋的政治背景和社会背景，追究制造“松川事件”的主谋犯。大冢强调指出，支援“松川事件”的斗争，是日本人民争取独立、和平与民主的国民运动的一个重要组成部分。
