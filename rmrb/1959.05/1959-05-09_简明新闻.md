	Raising Fresh Fish in High Altitude Mountain Areas
	Laiyuan County is a deep mountainous area in northwestern Hebei Province with high terrain and cold climate, and a frost-free period of one hundred and thirty days. Fish have never been raised here. In May last year, the Hongqi People's Commune of Nanchengzi Township, in order to develop diversified economy, boldly experimented with raising 15,000 small fish purchased from Henan Province. They adopted methods such as long-term sunning of water, digging pits facing the sun, and making them shallow in summer and deep in winter to raise the water temperature. With careful feeding and management, each fish has now grown to over half a catty, and some large ones weigh more than one catty.
