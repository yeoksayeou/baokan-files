Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, May 29th: According to a report today by the Vietnam News Agency, news from the border between the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and Laos states that the Lao Kingdom government troops opened fire on the former Pathet Lao fighting units on the 28th.

    The government of Phoui Sananikone has ordered the deployment of many units of the Lao Kingdom government troops to the mountainous and forested regions between Xieng Khouang and the Lao-Vietnam border. These troops opened fire on the former Pathet Lao fighting units, who resisted in self-defense.

    The Vietnam News Agency said that in this way, the Phoui Sananikone government, as a pawn of U.S. imperialism, has further exposed its plot to launch a civil war and attempt to eliminate the former Pathet Lao fighting units. Its actions undermine national reconciliation in Laos, aim to turn Laos into a U.S. military base, disrupt peace in Indochina, and seriously threaten the security of North Vietnam.

Xinhua, May 29th: Bangkok Dispatch: According to Thai newspapers, the Secretary-General of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO), Pote Sarasin, told the press on the 26th that the treacherous act of the Lao government of Phoui Sananikone, disregarding the Geneva Accords and the agreement between the Lao government and the former Pathet Lao fighting units by attacking the former Pathet Lao fighting units, was "the Lao government's suppression because it learned of the Communist rebellion plan."

    He also said that the events currently happening in Laos are "not a big problem." He described the Lao government's action, which blatantly violated the Geneva Accords, as "purely an internal affair of Laos."

    According to reports, Thai Foreign Minister Thanat Khoman also described the Lao government's violation of the Geneva Accords on the 24th as "an internal affair of Laos."

    According to Bangkok newspapers, the Lao ambassador to Thailand, Chao Khampan, brazenly told the Bangkok press on the 27th that the Lao government's tearing up of its own signed agreements was for the purpose of "rectifying" the former Pathet Lao fighting units, and said that the Lao government must not agree to the International Commission resuming its work in Laos. He also insisted that foreign countries cannot interfere in the Lao government's actions of trampling on the Geneva Accords and threatening peace in Indochina.

    不顾各国舆论警告　悍然破坏民族和解
    老挝政府军进攻前寮国战斗部队
    东南亚集团秘书长为老挝政府挑衅行为辩护
    新华社河内29日电　据越南通讯社今天报道，来自越南民主共和国和老挝边境的消息说，老挝王国政府军队在28日向前寮国战斗部队开火。
    培·萨纳尼空政府已经下令把老挝王国政府军队的许多部队调集到川圹和老挝—越南边境之间的山林地区。这些部队向前寮国战斗部队开了火，前寮国战斗部队为了自卫而进行了抵抗。
    越南通讯社说，这样，作为美帝国主义的爪牙的培·萨纳尼空政府已经进一步暴露了它发动内战和企图消灭前寮国战斗部队的阴谋。它的行动破坏了老挝的民族和解，要把老挝变成美国的军事基地，也破坏了印度支那的和平，并且严重地威胁越南北方的安全。
    新华社29日讯　曼谷消息：据泰国报纸报道，东南亚条约组织秘书长乃朴·沙拉信26日在向报界发表谈话时，把老挝培·萨纳尼空政府不顾日内瓦协议以及老挝政府和前寮国战斗部队的协议而进攻前寮国战斗部队的背信弃义行为，说成为“老挝政府因获悉共产党的叛变计划，因此才进行镇压”。
    他还说，目前老挝所发生的事件“不是一个大问题”。他把老挝政府这种公然破坏日内瓦协议的行动说成是“纯属老挝的内政问题”。
    据报道，泰国外交部长科曼在24日也把老挝政府破坏日内瓦协议的行为说成是“老挝的内政”。
    另据曼谷报纸报道，老挝驻泰国大使赵康番27日向曼谷报界发表谈话时，悍然把老挝政府撕毁它自己签订的协议说成是为了“整肃”前寮国战斗部队，并且说老挝政府一定不能答应国际委员会恢复在老挝的工作。他还硬说外国不能干预老挝政府这种蹂躏日内瓦协议、威胁印度支那和平的行动。
