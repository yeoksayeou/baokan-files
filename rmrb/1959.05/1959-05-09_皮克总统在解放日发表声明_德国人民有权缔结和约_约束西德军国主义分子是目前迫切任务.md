Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, May 8th. The German News Agency broadcasted on Liberation Day (May 8th) a statement by Wilhelm Pieck, President of the German Democratic Republic, titled "The German People Have the Right to Conclude a Peace Treaty."

President Pieck said: The anti-Hitler coalition's policy, as stated in the Potsdam Agreement, is the foundation for establishing a peaceful and democratic environment in Germany. This policy is in line with the interests of the German people. Only by adhering to the principles of the Potsdam Agreement can a solution to the German question be found and Germany be prevented from becoming a source of aggression again.

President Pieck said that in the eastern part of Germany—now the German Democratic Republic—the policies put forward in the Potsdam Agreement have been fully supported. In the western part of Germany, however, the Potsdam Agreement has been undermined.

The West German ruling circles are taking advantage of the abnormal situation that a peace treaty with Germany has not been concluded fourteen years after the end of the war to implement a policy of presenting people with a fait accompli. They are rapidly arming themselves, intensifying the arming of the West German troops of the North Atlantic bloc with rocket weapons and atomic weapons, and openly preparing them to launch a war of aggression against the East. The national interests of the German people require restraining the West German militarists and implementing a policy of peace and consultation there. This is the pressing task of the German people. Without resolving this task, there can be no progress in resolving the German question.

The President pointed out that the draft peace treaty with Germany proposed by the Soviet Union proceeds from the need to guarantee peace and recognize the sovereignty of the German people. The suggestions therein are conducive to Germany's development along a path of peace and democracy. The treaty will eliminate the unfavorable occupation system, open up great prospects for peace before the German people, and create favorable conditions for the two Germanys to approach and consult with each other. This is the only realistic path that can unify Germany into a peaceful and democratic country. Establishing a peace zone in Europe and easing tensions can pave the way for a peaceful resolution of the German question.

President Pieck said: Therefore, for the sake of the German people and neighboring countries, we demand that the upcoming Foreign Ministers' Conference in Geneva take decisive steps to formulate and conclude a peace treaty with Germany and end the occupation system in West Berlin. The German people are unwilling to remain without a peace treaty any longer.

The President finally pointed out that the German Democratic Republic is the guarantor of the peaceful future of the German people and a loyal friend of the people of all European countries in their struggle for peace and security.

　　皮克总统在解放日发表声明
    德国人民有权缔结和约
    约束西德军国主义分子是目前迫切任务
    新华社柏林8日电　德意志通讯社在解放日（5月8日）播发了德意志民主共和国总统皮克的题为“德国人民有缔结和约的权利”的声明。
    皮克总统说：在波茨坦协定中陈述的反希特勒同盟的政策，是在德国建立和平、民主的环境的基础。这个政策符合德国人民的利益。只有在遵守波茨坦协定的原则的情况下，才可能求得德国问题的解决，阻止德国再度成为侵略的策源地。
    皮克总统说，在德国的东部——现在的德意志民主共和国，波茨坦协定中提出的政策得到了完全的支持。而在德国的西部，波茨坦协定则遭到破坏。
    西德统治集团利用战争结束十四年以后仍然没有缔结对德和约这一不正常的状况，来执行使人面对既成事实的政策。他们在迅速武装起来，加紧用火箭武器和原子武器武装北大西洋集团的西德部队，公开使它们准备好向东方发动侵略战争。德国人民的民族利益要求约束西德的军国主义分子并在那里实行和平与协商的政策。这是德国人民的迫切任务，不解决这个任务，就谈不到在解决德国问题方面有所进展。
    总统指出，苏联所提出的对德和约草案是从必须保证和平和承认德国人民的主权这一点出发的。其中的建议有助于德国沿着和平、民主的方向发展。和约将会消灭不良的占领制度，将会在德国人民面前打开伟大的和平前景，并创造良好的条件使两个德国接近和协商。这是一条唯一现实的道路，可以把德国统一成为一个和平、民主的国家。在欧洲建立和平区以及缓和紧张局势，可以开辟和平解决德国问题的道路。
    皮克总统说：因此，为了德国人民和邻国的利益，我们要求即将在日内瓦开幕的外长会议采取决定性的步骤，来拟订并缔结对德和约和结束西柏林占领制度。德国人民不愿意再没有和约。
    总统最后指出，德意志民主共和国是德国人民的和平前途的保障者，是欧洲各国人民在争取和平与安全的斗争中的忠实朋友。
