Continue to Carry Forward the Revolutionary Tradition

The National Congress of Socialist Construction Activists of Martyrs' Families, Military Families, Disabled Soldiers, Demobilized Soldiers, Retired Soldiers, and Transferred Soldiers closed yesterday in the capital. This conference reviewed the brilliant achievements they have made in the Great Leap Forward over the past year and more, and exchanged advanced experiences. In accordance with the spirit of the First Session of the Second National People's Congress, the conference further mobilized them to play a greater active role on all fronts of socialist construction. We congratulate the victory of this conference with great joy and extend our highest respect to the glorious people who have contributed to the country and the people—all comrades of martyrs' families, military families, disabled soldiers, demobilized soldiers, retired soldiers, and transferred soldiers.

In the Great Leap Forward since last year, nearly 20 million martyrs' families and military families across the country, especially more than 7 million disabled, demobilized, retired, and transferred soldiers, have continued to carry forward the glorious tradition of hard struggle of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, becoming a huge force on the front line of socialist construction. In the construction of farmland water conservancy, they are active, brave, and unafraid of difficulties and dangers, and are a fresh force whether in arduous projects or in dangerous sections. For example, in Wushan County, Gansu Province, during the all-Party and all-people mass construction of farmland water conservancy, all 1,520 demobilized soldiers and capable martyrs' and military families in the county participated in the construction of canal water conservancy projects. In the movement for bumper harvests in agriculture, they can take the lead and become experts on the agricultural production front. According to statistics from Zhejiang Province, the province's martyrs' families, military families, and disabled, demobilized, retired, and transferred soldiers cultivated more than 380,000 mu of experimental fields, most of which achieved high yields. In the all-people running industry, especially the all-people mass steelmaking movement, they played a significant role. In many regions, almost all the demobilized soldiers have been投入into the battle. In the mass technical innovation and technical revolution movement, many people worked hard, boldly innovated, and dared to create, making many contributions. According to statistics from Shanxi Province, they created, improved, and imitated more than 800,000 agricultural implements in 1958; they offered more than 2 million suggestions and ideas, and more than 30,000 were called "native experts" and "all-rounders." Transferred soldiers who were collectively transferred to the border areas, reclamation areas, forestry, mines, and construction projects overcame the difficulties in production, work, and life, developed the border areas, established state-owned farms, and completed the various production tasks and construction projects assigned by the state. They also played an important role in assisting the People's Liberation Army in defending the border and coastal defenses, suppressing bandits, and quelling rebellions. They are also the backbone force in organizing and training militia. It is particularly worth mentioning that the disabled soldiers who were injured in the revolutionary struggle were not satisfied with their past significant contributions to the revolutionary cause, and overcame various difficulties with a tenacious fighting will and actively投入the socialist construction cause. The vast majority of them participated in production activities and scientific activities suitable for their physical conditions, and organized after-school performance teams or song and dance troupes to go deep into rural areas, troops, factories, mines, and organs and schools to widely carry out literary and artistic propaganda, singing the praises of the motherland's Great Leap Forward and the party and the people's meticulous care for them with a noble revolutionary optimistic spirit and heroic spirit. Many martyrs' families and military families with only half labor force or little labor force also actively participated in the production labor within their capacity and contributed to socialist construction. These vivid examples fully demonstrate that the national martyrs' families, military families, and disabled, demobilized, retired, and transferred soldiers have implemented Chairman Mao's spirit of "carrying forward the revolutionary tradition and striving for greater glory" and are worthy of being respected by the people of the country. The advanced deeds of the activists attending this conference are the concentrated embodiment of the brilliant achievements made by the national martyrs' families, military families, and disabled, demobilized, retired, and transferred soldiers.

The great achievements made by the national martyrs' families, military families, and disabled, demobilized, retired, and transferred soldiers in socialist construction are inseparable from the leadership of the Party and the support of the masses; they are also inseparable from their loyalty to the Party, listening to the Party's words, being selfless, sacrificing themselves for the group, resolutely safeguarding the interests of the Party, and their noble style of being wholeheartedly loyal to the revolution; they are inseparable from their ability to maintain the People's Army's fine tradition of hard work and not fearing any difficulties. Their noble qualities are respected and loved by the people of the country and have become a model for the people of the country to learn from.

At present, the people of the country are carrying out a vigorous increase production and practice economy movement, striving for new brilliant achievements, and welcoming the great tenth anniversary of the National Day. Under the leadership of the Party, the national martyrs' families, military families, and disabled, demobilized, retired, and transferred soldiers must actively投入the hot increase production and practice economy movement together with the people of the country, and play a greater active role. All martyrs' families, military families, and disabled, demobilized, retired, and transferred soldiers must further carry forward the fine tradition of the People's Liberation Army of not fearing any difficulties and working hard, overcome all obstacles in the advancement, and build the socialist motherland more bravely and actively; they must love labor more, love their work, and make extraordinary achievements in ordinary careers; they must continue to listen to the Party's words and resolutely go wherever the Party points; do whatever work the Party needs us to do; if the Party needs us in the countryside, we must settle down in the countryside and participate in rural construction; if the Party needs to develop the border areas, we will happily accept this glorious task; we must guard against arrogance and impetuosity, humbly learn from the masses, listen to the opinions of the masses, unite the masses, and rely on the masses.

In order to enable martyrs' families, military families, and disabled, demobilized, retired, and transferred soldiers to play a greater active role in socialist construction, Party committees and people's governments at all levels must also strengthen their leadership and support for them, do a good job in their political and ideological education, and establish some necessary systems to make these tasks regular; at the same time, they must also do a good job in arranging their production and life, and help them solve some difficulties encountered in production and life, so as to create favorable conditions for them to play a greater role in various construction undertakings.

We believe that through the convening of this conference of activists, through the active efforts of all martyrs' families, military families, and disabled, demobilized, retired, and transferred soldiers, and with the attention of Party and government leaders at all levels and the care of the broad masses of people, the national martyrs' families, military families, and disabled, demobilized, retired, and transferred soldiers will play a greater active role in the socialist construction cause and the cause of consolidating national defense construction of the great motherland.

    继续发扬革命传统
    全国烈士家属、军人家属和残废军人、复员军人、退伍军人以及转业军人社会主义建设积极分子大会昨天在首都闭幕了。这次大会检阅了他们一年多来在大跃进中所取得的辉煌成就，并且交流了先进经验。大会还根据第二届全国人民代表大会第一次会议的精神，进一步动员他们在社会主义建设的各个战线上，发挥更大的积极作用。我们怀着十分喜悦的心情，祝这次大会的胜利，并向有功于国家、有功于人民的光荣的人们——烈士家属、军人家属和残废军人、复员军人、退伍军人以及转业军人的全体同志们，致以崇高的敬意。
    在去年以来的大跃进中，全国近两千万烈属、军属，特别是七百多万残废、复员、退伍、转业军人，继续发扬了中国人民解放军艰苦奋斗的光荣传统，成为社会主义建设战线上一支巨大的力量。他们在兴修农田水利中，积极勇敢，不避艰险，无论在艰巨的工程里或在险要的地段上都是一支生力军。例如，甘肃省武山县在全党全民大兴农田水利中，全县一千五百二十名复员军人和有劳动能力的烈属、军属就全部参加了兴修渠道的水利工程。在农业丰产运动中，他们都能积极带头，成为农业生产战线上的能手。据浙江省统计，全省烈属、军属和残废、复员、退伍、转业军人种植的试验田有三十八万多亩，大部分获得了高产。在全民办工业、特别是全民大炼钢铁的运动中，他们发挥了重大的作用。很多地区的复员军人，几乎全部投入了战斗。在全民大搞技术革新和技术革命运动中，许多人苦学苦钻，大胆革新，敢于创造，做出了很多的贡献。据山西省统计，他们在1958年创造、改良和仿制的各种农具就有八十多万件；他们献策献计达二百多万条，称为“土专家”、“万宝全”的就有三万多人。集体转业在边疆、农垦地区、林业、矿山和建筑工程中的转业军人，克服了生产、工作和生活各方面的困难，开发了边疆，建立了国营农场，完成了国家交给的各项生产任务和建设工程。在协助人民解放军保卫边防和海防、剿匪、平叛等斗争中，他们也发挥了重要的作用。他们还是组织和训练民兵中的骨干力量。特别要提出的是，在革命斗争中因伤残废的残废军人，他们并不满足于过去在革命事业中的重大贡献，以顽强的战斗意志克服了种种困难，积极地投入了社会主义的建设事业中。他们中的绝大多数都参加了适合自己身体条件的生产活动和科学活动，并且组织课余演出队或歌舞团，深入农村、部队、工厂、矿山和机关、学校，广泛地开展文艺宣传，以高尚的革命乐观主义精神和豪迈的英雄气概，歌颂祖国的大跃进，歌颂党和人民对他们无微不至的关怀。许多只有半劳动力或少许有劳动力的烈属、军属也积极地参加了力所能及的生产劳动，为社会主义建设贡献出自己的力量。这些生动的事例，都充分说明了全国烈属、军属和残废、复员、退伍、转业军人贯彻执行毛主席所说的“发扬革命传统，争取更大光荣”的精神，不愧为全国人民的尊敬的光荣的人物。这次到会的积极分子的先进事迹，就是全国烈属、军属和残废、复员、退伍、转业军人作出辉煌成就的集中体现。
    全国烈属、军属和残废、复员、退伍、转业军人在社会主义建设中所作出的伟大成就，是和党的领导和群众的支持分不开的；也是和他们忠于党，听党的话，大公无私，舍己为群，坚决维护党的利益，对革命赤胆忠心的高尚风格分不开的；是和他们能保持人民军队艰苦奋斗，不怕任何困难的优良传统分不开的。他们这种高贵品质，受到全国人民的尊敬和爱戴，成为全国人民应该学习的榜样。
    目前，全国人民正在开展轰轰烈烈的增产节约运动，争取新的辉煌成就，迎接伟大的国庆十周年。全国烈属、军属和残废、复员、退伍、转业军人要在党的领导下，和全国人民一道，积极地投入火热的增产节约运动中去，发挥更大的积极作用。全体烈属、军属和残废、复员、退伍、转业军人，必须进一步发扬人民解放军的不怕任何困难、艰苦奋斗的优良传统，战胜前进中的一切障碍，更勇敢更积极地建设社会主义的祖国；要更热爱劳动，热爱自己的工作，在平凡的事业中做出不平凡的事迹；要继续听党的话，坚决地作到党指向哪里，就奔向哪里；党需要我们做什么工作，就做什么工作；党需要在农村，就要安心在农村，参加农村建设；党需要开发边疆，就愉快地接受这个光荣的任务；要戒骄戒躁，虚心地向群众学习，倾听群众的意见，团结群众，依靠群众。
    为了使烈属、军属和残废、复员、退伍、转业军人在社会主义建设中发挥更大的积极作用，各级党委和人民政府还必须加强对他们的领导和支持，要做好对他们的政治思想教育，并且建立一些必要的制度，使这些工作经常化；同时，还必须做好对他们的生产和生活的安排，帮助他们解决生产和生活中遇到的一些困难，从而为他们在各项建设事业中发挥更大的作用创造有利的条件。
    我们相信，通过这次积极分子大会的召开，经过全体烈属、军属和残废、复员、退伍、转业军人的积极努力，在各级党、政领导的重视和广大群众的关怀下，全国烈属、军属和残废、复员、退伍、转业军人将会在伟大祖国的社会主义建设事业中和巩固国防建设的事业中，发挥更大的积极作用。
