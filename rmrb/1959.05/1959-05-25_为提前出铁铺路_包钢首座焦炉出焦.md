Xinhua News Agency, Baotou, May 24th. Baotou Iron and Steel Company's first large-scale modern coke oven - No. 4 coke oven - was put into production ahead of schedule on the 22nd.

At 11:15 p.m. on the 22nd, this coke oven produced coke. Di Rui, the general commander on the top of the furnace and the director of the workshop, stood on the towering top of the furnace and issued the order to produce coke. Veteran workers Zhou Guilin and Wu Heshui concentrated their attention and slowly started the coke pusher and coke interceptor car from the left and right sides of the coke oven, approaching the No. 69 furnace door. Suddenly, gongs, drums, applause, and firecrackers erupted. The tall furnace door automatically rose, and the red-hot coke immediately poured out of the corridor of the coke interceptor car, rolling into the quenching car with a roar. The quenching car, full of red-hot coke, drove into the quenching tower, and instantly smoke billowed, rising into the night sky. After a while, the quenching car retreated to the front of the furnace and dumped the coke onto the coke chute on the conveyor belt. It took only five minutes from coke pushing to this point. The people present warmly shook hands and congratulated each other, congratulating the smooth commissioning of Baotou Steel's first large coke oven.

This large coke oven, with an annual output of 500,000 tons, was originally scheduled to be completed and put into production in October this year. Its early commissioning not only creates conditions for Baotou Iron and Steel Company to produce iron ahead of schedule, but also can produce coke to support small and medium-sized iron and steel smelting enterprises in other places.

    为提前出铁铺路
    包钢首座焦炉出焦
    新华社包头24日电　包头钢铁公司第一座大型现代化焦炉——四号焦炉，提前在22日投入生产。
    22日晚上十一时十五分，这座焦炉出焦了。炉顶总指挥、车间主任狄锐，站在高耸的炉顶上发出了出焦的命令，老工人周桂林、吴河水全神贯注，分别从焦炉左右两侧徐徐地开动推焦机和拦焦车，靠近了六十九号炉门，顿时，锣鼓声、掌声、鞭炮声爆发，只见高大的炉门自动升起，通红的焦炭随即从拦焦车的夹道里倾泻而出，轰隆轰隆地滚进了消火车。消火车满载着火红的焦炭开进了消火塔，刹时烟雾滚滚，腾上夜空。过了一会儿，消火车退回炉前，将焦炭倒在皮带运输机上面的溜焦台上。从推焦到这时，一共只用了五分钟。在场的人们热烈地互相握手祝贺，祝贺包钢第一座大型焦炉顺利地投入生产。
    这座年产五十万吨的大型焦炉，原计划是今年10月份建成开始生产的。它的提早投入生产，不仅给包头钢铁公司提前出铁创造了条件，而且可以生产焦炭支援外地的中小型钢铁冶炼企业。
