Hanoi, May 27 (Reported by this newspaper) – The Vietnamese Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced this afternoon the text of a letter dated May 18 from Pham Van Dong, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, to the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference on Indochina issues, as follows:

To the Esteemed Chairmen:

In my letters to you dated February 4 and March 4, 1959, I drew your attention to the violations of the Geneva Accords on Laos, which are detrimental to maintaining and consolidating peace in Indochina and Southeast Asia, and requested that you take appropriate measures to resolve them.

These violations continue to this day, the situation has become more serious, and the situation in Indochina and Southeast Asia has become more tense. On the one hand, the Royal Lao Government continues to carry out terrorist suppression of former Pathet Lao combat forces and continues to allow the United States to further interfere in Laos, intending to turn Laos into a US military base to promote their plot to drag Laos into the Southeast Asia bloc. This situation has threatened the security of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. On the other hand, the Royal Lao Government continues to allow the South Vietnamese authorities to use Laos as a springboard for espionage and provocative activities against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

Recently, the situation in Laos has become extremely serious. The many new events that have recently occurred prove the accusations previously made by Prince Souphanouvong, Chairman of the Lao Patriotic Party, to the International Supervisory and Control Commission in Laos, and the threatening statements made by Prime Minister Phoui Sananikone in the Lao National Assembly, have become facts.

The Phoui Sananikone government has falsely accused the former Pathet Lao combat forces of opposing the King and the Royal Government, and on this pretext, concentrated a large number of Royal Armed Forces with artillery and paratroopers to surround the two battalions of the former Pathet Lao combat forces stationed in Luang Prabang and Xieng Khouang. These two battalions are under the threat of being disarmed and dissolved by the Royal Armed Forces at any time. These provocative acts by the Lao Royal Armed Forces, which could cause bloody conflicts, have further deteriorated the already worsened situation in Laos.

In addition, the Royal Lao Government, taking advantage of this artificial tense situation, disregarded the agreement between the Kingdom of Laos and the former Pathet Lao combat forces regarding democratic freedoms, showed no respect for the most basic inviolability of parliamentarians, and ordered military police to surround the residences of Lao Patriotic Party leaders, including Prince Souphanouvong, and many other parliamentarians. In many places, members of the Lao Patriotic Party have been illegally arrested by the Lao authorities.

The above-mentioned actions of the Phoui Sananikone government clearly and blatantly violate the agreement signed between the Royal Government and the Pathet Lao combat forces, and blatantly violate the Geneva Accords on Laos.

The above-mentioned actions of the Phoui Sananikone government are making the situation in Laos extremely serious, which not only undermines national harmony and the policy of peace and neutrality in Laos, but also intensifies the threat to the security of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and undermines peace in Indochina and Southeast Asia.

As a party to the Geneva Accords on Laos, and as a neighbor that has always strived to strengthen friendly relations with the Lao Kingdom on the basis

    范文同致函日内瓦会议两位主席
    强烈抗议老挝政府违反日内瓦协议
    要求采取紧急措施使国际委员会恢复活动
    本报河内27日电  越南外交部今天下午公布越南民主共和国外交部长范文同5月18日写给关于印度支那问题的日内瓦会议两位主席的信，全文如下：两位主席先生：
    在1959年2月4日和3月4日寄给您们的信中，我曾经提请您们对那不利于维持和巩固印度支那和东南亚和平的违反老挝日内瓦协议的情况加以注意，并请您们采取适当措施加以解决。
    这种违反协议的情况至今仍在继续着，局势已变得更为严重，并使印度支那和东南亚局势更加紧张起来。老挝王国政府一方面不断地对前寮国战斗部队人员进行恐怖镇压，继续让美国进一步干涉老挝，打算把老挝变成美国的军事基地，以促进他们把老挝拉入东南亚集团的阴谋，这种情况已威胁着越南民主共和国的安宁。另一方面，老挝王国政府继续让南越当局利用老挝作为向越南民主共和国进行间谍和挑衅活动的跳板。
    最近，老挝局势已变得极端严重。最近新发生的许多事件，证明老挝爱国党主席苏发努冯亲王以前向老挝国际监督和监察委员会提出的控诉以及培·萨纳尼空首相最近在老挝国会上发表的威胁性的声明已经成为事实。
    培·萨纳尼空政府诬蔑前寮国战斗部队反对国王、反对王国政府，并以此为借口，集中拥有炮兵和伞兵的大量王国军队包围驻在琅勃拉邦和川圹的前寮国战斗部队两个营。这两个营正处在随时可能被王国军队缴械和解散的威胁之下，老挝王国军队的这些可能引起流血冲突的挑衅行为，使已经恶化的老挝局势更为恶化。
    此外，老挝王国政府还利用这一人为的紧张局势，不顾老挝王国同前寮国战斗部队签订的关于民主自由权的协定，毫不尊重议员的最起码的不可侵犯权，下令军警包围包括苏发努冯亲王在内的老挝爱国党领袖和其他许多议员的住宅。在许多地方，老挝爱国党党员被老挝当局非法逮捕。
    培·萨纳尼空政府的上述行动，显然已明目张胆地违反了王国政府同寮国战斗部队签订的协议，明目张胆地违反了关于老挝问题的日内瓦协议。
    培·萨纳尼空政府的上述行动正在使老挝局势变得极其严重，这不仅破坏了老挝的民族和睦和和平中立政策，而且还加剧了对越南民主共和国的安全的威胁，破坏了印度支那和东南亚的和平。
    作为签订关于老挝问题的日内瓦协议的一方，作为随时努力在和平共处五项原则的基础上增强同老挝王国的友好关系的一个邻国，越南民主共和国政府不能不对当前老挝的局势表示关切和忧虑。
    越南民主共和国政府特向日内瓦会议两位主席强烈抗议和谴责老挝王国政府上述极其严重的违反日内瓦协议的行动，并且宣告：培·萨纳尼空政府必须对他们在老挝一意孤行所造成的后果负完全责任。
    为了和缓老挝当前的局势，避免产生更加严重的事态，保证印度支那和东南亚的和平，越南民主共和国政府恳切要求日内瓦会议两位主席采取紧急和有效措施，使老挝国际监督和监察委员会立即恢复活动，以调查上述老挝王国政府违反日内瓦协议的行动。
