Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, May 23rd (By our correspondent Wan Guang) -- In the recent days of the Foreign Ministers' Conference, the foreign ministers of the United States, Britain, and France, along with the West German representative, have repeatedly spoken out against the Soviet Union's proposal for the rapid conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany. Their speeches have been lengthy, but their arguments have been exceedingly poor, merely monotonously repeating that "a peace treaty cannot be concluded; Germany must be unified first." They have tried their best to portray themselves as "champions of German reunification," but in reality, they are using empty talk of "unification" to obstruct the decisive steps toward a peaceful resolution of the German question through the conclusion of a peace treaty, and to obstruct the genuine achievement of peaceful German reunification through the rapprochement and negotiation of the two German states. In reality, none of these countries wish for German reunification, and based on their respective policy considerations, they all intend to maintain the divided state of Germany indefinitely.

Even American bourgeois newspapers openly admit this. The well-known columnist Walter Lippmann wrote in the "New York Herald Tribune" on the 21st: "It is no secret that there is strong sentiment among the Western Allies against the reunification of Germany."

The United States and the West German ruling group, with its support, have not abandoned their "program" of annexing the German Democratic Republic to "unify Germany." This is what the West German militarists dream of. However, some of them cannot help but see that this is not a "program" they have the "strength" to realize, and it is by no means easy to change the reality that the German Democratic Republic exists. In this situation where they lack the power to do so, they would rather firmly control West Germany first and not change the current situation in the slightest. "New York Times" reporter Middleton pointed out in a report on the 17th that "A major factor in Bonn's thinking is that: the current situation in Europe favors West Germany," and "as long as the current division of Europe and Germany continues for one more day," Adenauer can conveniently act according to his intentions for one more day. It is not at all difficult for people to find the intentions of the Adenauer group in West German representative Grewe's speech at the Foreign Ministers' Conference. Grewe openly complained that the draft peace treaty with Germany proposed by the Soviet Union contained so-called "discrimination" against Germany, such as stipulating that West Germany be prohibited from "freely" participating in Western military blocs, restricting West Germany's army and armaments, and prohibiting West Germany from seeking revengeful parties that seek to change Germany's current borders. US Secretary of State Herter also attacked the Soviet proposal in his speech as "depriving" West Germany of the above-mentioned "rights." Anyone with discerning eyes can see that the West German militarists, with the support of the United States, insist on dividing Germany in order to use West Germany as a base to prepare for a new war of aggression in Europe. Isn't this very clear?

French Foreign Minister Couve de Murville absurdly said repeatedly at the Foreign Ministers' Conference that there was no need to conclude a peace treaty with Germany because all the problems in Europe had already been resolved. On the 21st, he also strongly opposed breaking the current "balance of power" in Europe and opposed "artificially changing the status quo." What do these words mean? On the one hand, the representative of the French government, which is linked to West Germany as an "axis," is acting as a "spokesman for West Germany" in Geneva, doing its best to maintain the "status quo" that allows West German militarism to intensify its atomic armament; on the other hand, the de Gaulle government does indeed want to maintain the current division of Germany. According to French newspapers, the de Gaulle government clearly sees that once West German militarists control the entire Germany, it will be a more difficult opponent for France to deal with in the struggle for hegemony in Western Europe than it is now when it only controls West Germany.

After the end of World War II, Britain has also consistently supported the United States' policy of reviving West German militarism. However, recently, Britain itself cannot help but feel the real threat of the resurgence of West German militarism. West Germany, supporting the Western European "Common Market" group, has begun to openly speak to Britain as the hegemon of Western Europe. The British bourgeois press has frequently talked about West Germany "forming the most powerful army in Western Europe," becoming a "time bomb," and becoming a "terrible threat," and so on. The British rulers have always wanted Germany to be divided in order to weaken its traditional rival in Europe, especially in the current situation where West Germany is gradually gaining strength. "New York Times" reporter Reston wrote a few days ago: Britain "is more worried about the (Western European) Common Market than about a common enemy," and "the division of Germany is simply not something he (the British) cries about on his pillow at night."

US Secretary of State Herter once talked a lot about the so-called history of Western countries seeking "unified Germany" at the Foreign Ministers' Conference. However, it is better not to talk about history, because talking about history only exposes the West even more thoroughly. Anyone familiar with history knows that at the Tehran Conference in 1943 and the Yalta Conference in 1945, the United States repeatedly proposed plans to divide Germany into five countries. Britain had also proposed a suggestion to divide Germany into three countries. However, these were all resolutely opposed by the Soviet Union. Only under the insistence of the Soviet Union did the Potsdam Agreement stipulate that Germany should be restored to a unified, peaceful, and democratic country. However, since the end of the war, from the separate implementation of currency reform in the US, British, and French occupation zones of Germany in 1948, the formulation of the West German "Occupation Statute" and the establishment of the divided Bonn government in 1949, the decision to rebuild the West German army in 1951, the dragging of West Germany into the North Atlantic aggressive bloc in 1952, to the intensification of West German atomic armament in recent years, all can only illustrate one point: that the United States and other Western countries have deliberately taken steps to divide Germany, and that the United States and other Western countries have consistently adhered to a policy of dividing Germany. The starting point of this policy is to revive West German militarism, obstruct the normalization of the European situation, and make West Germany the source of aggression war in Europe. And this is a major root cause of the current tense situation in Europe. This is a fundamental reason why the United States and other Western countries and West Germany are currently stubbornly opposing the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany and obstructing the normal development of the German situation.

    西方国家以伪善手法阻挠外长会议进展
    口头上装成德国统一的卫士  骨子里实是分裂德国的罪人
    新华社日内瓦23日电　本社记者万光报道：在最近几天的外长会议上，美英法外长和西德代表一次又一次地发言，反对苏联关于迅速缔结对德和约的建议。他们的发言长篇累牍，但是论点贫乏异常，只是单调地重复说：“不能缔结和约，首先必须统一德国”。他们竭力把自己打扮成为“德国统一的卫士”，然而实际上是用“统一”的空谈来阻挠通过缔结和约在和平解决德国问题上迈开决定性的步伐，来阻挠通过两个德国的接近和谈判真正达成德国的和平统一。他们之中实际上没有一个国家愿望德国统一，根据各自的政策考虑，都是企图无限期地保持德国的分裂状态。
    连美国的资产阶级报纸也公开承认这一点。著名专栏作家李普曼21日在“纽约先驱论坛报”上写道：“在西方盟国中有着反对德国重新统一的强烈情绪，而这并不是秘密。”
    美国和在它支持下的西德统治集团，没有放弃它们并吞德意志民主共和国来“统一德国”的“纲领”。西德军国主义者梦寐以求的就是这一点。然而他们中间也有一些人不能不看到，这并不是一个他们有“实力”来实现的“纲领”，想改变德意志民主共和国存在这样一个现实，决非轻易之举。在这种力不从心的情况下，他们就宁愿首先牢牢地控制住西德，而不愿稍稍变动目前存在的局势。“纽约时报”记者密德尔顿在17日的报道中指出：“波恩想法中的一个主要因素是：目前欧洲形势有利于西德”，“只要欧洲和德国目前的分裂继续一天”，阿登纳便能方便地按照他的意图行事一天。人们一点也不难于从西德代表格雷韦在外长会议上的演说寻找出阿登纳集团的意图。格雷韦公开抱怨苏联提出的对德和约草案对德国有所谓“歧视”，诸如规定要禁止西德“自由”参加西方军事集团，要限制西德的军队和武装，要禁止西德谋求改变目前德国疆界的复仇主义政党等。而美国国务卿赫脱在演说里也同样攻击苏联建议“剥夺”了西德的上述种种“权利”。明眼人一看便知道，西德军国主义者在美国支持下坚持分裂德国，是为了要以西德为基地来在欧洲准备新的侵略战争，这难道不是十分明白的吗？
　　法国外长德姆维尔在外长会议上一再荒唐地说无需缔结对德和约，因为欧洲所有的问题目前都已经解决。他在21日还强烈地表示反对打破目前欧洲的“力量均衡”，反对“人为地改变现状”。他的这些话又说明了什么呢？一方面，同西德连成“轴心”的法国政府的代表，正在日内瓦充当着“西德的代言人”，竭力维护让西德军国主义能够加紧原子武装的“现状”；另一方面，戴高乐政府也的确愿意保持目前德国的分裂状态。据法国报纸报道，戴高乐政府清楚地看到，一旦西德军国主义者控制了整个德国，那它将比之目前仅仅控制西德，会成为法国在争夺西欧霸权中更难于打交道的对手。
    在第二次世界大战结束后，英国也是一直支持美国复活西德军国主义的政策的。但是，最近以来，英国本身也不能不首先感到西德军国主义再起的现实威胁了。西德扶持着西欧“共同市场”集团，开始公然以西欧霸主自居来向英国说话。英国资产阶级报刊已经经常在谈论西德“将组成一支西欧最强大的军队”，将成为“定时炸弹”，将成为“可怕的威胁”等等。英国统治者是一向要德国分裂，以削弱它在欧洲传统的竞争对手的，在目前西德羽毛逐渐丰盛的情况下尤其是如此。“纽约时报”记者赖斯顿几天前写道：英国“对（西欧）共同市场比对共同敌人还担心”，“德国的分裂根本就不是他（英国人）晚上在枕头上为之啜泣的事情”。
    美国国务卿赫脱曾经在外长会议上大谈过所谓西方国家谋求“统一德国”的历史。然而，不谈历史则罢，一谈历史，只有把西方的底戳得更穿。凡是熟悉历史的人都知道，在1943年德黑兰会议和1945年雅尔塔会议上，美国曾一再提出把德国分裂为五个国家的计划。英国也曾经提出过把德国分为三个国家的建议。然而这些都遭到了苏联的坚决反对。只是在苏联坚持下，波茨坦协定才规定了德国应恢复成为一个统一的、和平的、民主的国家。但是，自战争结束以后，从1948年德国的美、英、法三国占领区单独实行币制改革，1949年三国制订西德“占领法规”和成立分裂的波恩政府，1951年决定重建西德军队，1952年把西德拉进北大西洋侵略集团，以至近几年来加紧西德原子武装等等，都只能说明一点，是美国和其他西方国家执意采取了分裂德国的步骤，是美国和其他西方国家一贯坚持分裂德国的政策。这个政策的出发点是为了复活西德军国主义，阻挠欧洲局势的正常化，使西德成为欧洲发动侵略战争的策源地。而这就是欧洲目前紧张局势的一个主要根源。这就是美国等西方国家及西德目前顽固地反对缔结对德和约、阻挠德国局势正常发展的一个根本原因。
