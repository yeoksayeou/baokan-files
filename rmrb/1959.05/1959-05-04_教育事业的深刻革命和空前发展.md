A Profound Revolution and Unprecedented Development in Education
Speech by Minister of Education Yang Xiufeng

Mr. Chairman, esteemed delegates:

I fully agree with Premier Zhou Enlai's Government Work Report and the reports by Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen.

First, let me cheer the great victory achieved by the heroic People's Liberation Army in quelling the rebellion in Tibet! With the imminent complete elimination of the Tibetan rebels, the Tibetan people will, through gradual democratic reforms, embark on a bright path of democratic socialism together with all ethnic groups in the country. This is a matter of great joy for the Tibetan people and other ethnic groups in the country. The British imperialists and Indian expansionists, in their attempt to separate Tibet from the motherland, have suffered a shameful defeat. They are now attempting to use the so-called "Declaration of the Dalai Lama" they fabricated to stir up a wave of slander and opposition against the new China, distorting the truth about our government's suppression of the Tibetan rebellion in front of the people of the world. This conspiracy will also soon be bankrupt. Our government highly values the friendly relations between China and India, but this friendly relationship is now being undermined by Indian expansionists. All imperialists and reactionaries should be clear: the 600 million Chinese people who have stood up will never tolerate interference in China's internal affairs or damage to China's territorial integrity. The Chinese people will use the greatest enthusiasm to complete and over fulfill this year's national economic plan, accelerate socialist construction, strengthen national power, and consolidate national defense, to answer the conspiracies and clamors of imperialists and reactionaries!

Premier Zhou has spoken very clearly about the great achievements made in education in the past few years, especially last year, and the tasks on the cultural and educational front in the future. Now I would just like to share some personal experiences in implementing the education policy over the past year, and focus on some suggestions for the arrangement of education work in 1959. Please give your comments and corrections, delegates.

In 1958, China's education experienced two outstanding developments: one was the implementation of the policy of combining education with productive labor, which led to a huge and profound revolution in education; the other was the implementation of the mass line of the whole Party and the whole people running schools, adopting the policy of "walking on two legs," which brought about unprecedented development in education.

Combining education with productive labor is a profound revolution in education

Implementing the combination of education and productive labor is the "only way to cultivate all-round development of human beings" and the only way to cultivate "cultured laborers with socialist consciousness." In 1958, teachers and students at all levels of schools, from running schools with diligence and thrift to running factories and farms on a large scale, going to the countryside and factories, and participating in the nationwide steel-making and autumn harvest, autumn plowing, and autumn sowing movements, not only supported the great leap forward in China's industrial and agricultural production and created material wealth for the country, but more importantly, transformed the thinking of teachers and students. Their past bourgeois views of belittling physical labor and belittling working people have been greatly changed, their labor views and mass views have been strengthened, and their socialist and communist consciousness has been raised. They summarized their gains as follows: "Calloused hands, changed stance; tanned skin, refined ideology." Changing stance and refining ideology are precisely the primary requirements of our socialist education.

Wherever education is well combined with productive labor, the teaching quality of cultural and scientific knowledge has been improved, and students' ability to work independently has also been enhanced. This is because teachers and students, through the practice of productive labor, gain perceptual knowledge and operational skills in industrial and agricultural production, making it easier for teachers to connect with reality, and easier for students to learn deeply and firmly than before.

Driven by productive practice, scientific research in universities and colleges, as well as scientific activities in some secondary technical schools and senior high schools, has been unprecedentedly developed. According to incomplete statistics, the number of scientific research projects completed by universities and colleges last year was more than ten times that of 1957, and the results achieved exceeded the total of the eight years after liberation. There has also been a good start in the research of the latest science and technology. The achievements displayed at the "Exhibition of the Combination of Education and Productive Labor" held in Beijing last winter truly demonstrated a great leap forward situation of ten thousand horses galloping forward.

After teachers and students participated in productive labor, combined with the development of mass sports and health campaigns, their physical fitness has generally improved, and the number of patients has been greatly reduced.

The above facts powerfully demonstrate the correctness of the Party's education policy, and demonstrate that fully implementing this policy will inevitably enable students to develop in terms of moral, intellectual, and physical education, thereby comprehensively improving the quality of education.

Several major experiences in implementing the policy of combining education and productive labor over the past year

Over the past year, we have gained the following major experiences in the process of implementing the policy of combining education and productive labor.

First, the education revolution must be based on ideological revolution. Last year, on the basis of the victory of the rectification campaign and the anti-rightist struggle, schools at all levels carried out a series of ideological struggles to "promote proletarian ideology and eliminate bourgeois ideology," such as the "two-antis" movement, the red and expert debate, the great debate on education policy, and the criticism of bourgeois education thought and academic thought. The deepening of the ideological revolution prepared the conditions for the education revolution. Without the victory of the ideological revolution, there would be no victory of the education revolution. In the future, to implement the Party's education policy, we must continue to carry out the struggle between the two roads and the two methods under the leadership of the Party.

Second, to implement the policy of combining education and productive labor, it is necessary to formally include productive labor in the education plan, clarify its purpose, and plan the teaching, productive labor, and student life in a planned manner, closely combining labor practice with theoretical teaching, so that it becomes a complete teaching process. This is a complex task that requires concrete and meticulous arrangements. Last autumn, some schools, due to lack of experience, did not arrange the education plan well enough, with fewer classes, so the teaching quality failed to achieve the due improvement. Attention has now been paid to correction.

Third, correctly resolving the relationship between theory and practice is an important link in comprehensively implementing the education policy. Since the implementation of the education policy, the tendency of theory being divorced from practice has been powerfully reversed. However, it cannot be ignored that the thought of belittling labor and belittling practice still exists among many teachers and students, and cannot be eliminated in a short period of time. The struggle against this thought is still a difficult task in the long term. At the same time, the ideological tendency of one-sidedly understanding that theory comes from practice, only valuing practical knowledge and direct experience, and neglecting theoretical knowledge and indirect experience has sprouted, and must also be overcome and prevented. Only by correctly combining productive labor with teaching, theory and practice, can the Party's education policy be comprehensively implemented.

Of course, as Premier Zhou said in his report, "For such a thorough revolution in education, we now only have preliminary experience, there are still shortcomings in our work, and there are still some problems that need further research and resolution." In particular, some specific practices still need to be further explored and studied, but we believe that as long as the direction is correct, and through long-term efforts, a new education system that meets the needs of China's socialist cause will gradually be established and improved.

The whole people running schools has brought about unprecedented development in China's education

In 1958, China's education achieved unprecedented development. In this year, literacy work was carried out among 60 million people, exceeding the literacy achievements of the past eight years. Industrial and mining enterprises and people's communes ran various types of spare-time schools, with approximately 30 million people participating in learning; this cannot be said to be a small matter. Preschool education developed rapidly, with more than 30 million children in kindergartens, an increase of more than 27 times compared to 1957. The number of primary school students reached 86 million, an increase of 34 percent compared to 1957. In secondary education: the number of students in ordinary middle schools reached 8.52 million, an increase of 36 percent compared to 1957; the number of students in secondary specialized schools reached 1.47 million, an increase of 89 percent compared to 1957; the number of students enrolled in agricultural middle schools and other vocational middle schools newly established in 1958 reached more than 2 million; in total, the number of secondary school students increased by 70 percent compared to 1957. The number of students in universities and colleges reached 660,000, an increase of 50 percent compared to 1957. The unprecedented development of China's education is a victory for the Party's general line for building socialism, a victory for the Party's mass line, and a victory for the implementation of the "walking on two legs" development policy.

The experience of the comprehensive great leap forward in education in 1958 proves that the set of "walking on two legs" policies put forward in the instructions on education work issued by the Party Central Committee and the State Council last year has pointed out a broad road for the development of China's education. Only by giving full play to the enthusiasm of all departments of the central government, all localities, and the broad masses in running schools, and rationally arranging the three types of schools, full-time, part-time, and spare-time, under the principle of "the whole country as a chessboard" and the combination of leadership and the masses, can we develop education more, faster, better, and more economically; can we popularize education and cultivate a contingent of tens of millions of working-class intellectuals who are both red and expert in a relatively short period of time in our "poor and blank," populous country.

Implementing the simultaneous operation of full-time, part-time, and spare-time schools can not only develop education more, faster, better, and more economically, but also meet the cultural needs of the broad masses of young people and adults in the current situation of heavy production tasks and tight labor resources. With the gradual improvement of labor productivity and the gradual shortening of working hours, full-time schools will gradually increase, and the spare-time learning time of adults will also gradually increase.

In the development of education, we must adhere to the principle of combining popularization and improvement. Neglecting popularization or neglecting improvement will make it difficult to quickly change the backward cultural face of our country and achieve a surge in science and culture. Only by adopting the policy of "walking on two legs" of massive popularization and partial improvement can we appropriately resolve the contradiction between quantity and quality. We use the methods of developing part-time schools, spare-time schools, and factory-run schools to meet the needs of popularization; on the other hand, we improve the quality of full-time schools at all levels, and select a group of schools among full-time schools as key points, focusing on improving quality, so that they become the backbone of education. This rational use of limited forces takes care of both popularization and improvement, and takes into account both quantity and quality, so that the development of education has initiative.

Several tasks that should be done well this year

According to the tasks on the cultural and educational front put forward in Premier Zhou's report, the main task of education this year should be to mobilize all positive factors, focusing on rectification and consolidation, and appropriate development on the basis of last year's great development; to further comprehensively implement the education policy, and vigorously improve the quality of education. In order to successfully complete this task, I think the following tasks should be done well:

1. Regarding the development of education. Continue to actively and enthusiastically carry out the movement to eliminate illiteracy among young and middle-aged people. Consolidate and develop various spare-time schools, and organize young and middle-aged people who have already escaped illiteracy to continue learning, in order to consolidate and improve literacy results. The development of spare-time education must start from serving production, and take into account the tight labor situation, and carry out teaching in conjunction with production tasks and central work, so as to ensure that both production and learning are not neglected.

In areas where primary school education has been basically popularized, focus on doing a good job in consolidation and improvement; in areas where primary school education has not yet been popularized, actively carry out popularization work. Various part-time middle schools should generally be consolidated, improved, and appropriately developed. High schools and teacher training schools at all levels, as well as universities and colleges in areas with weak foundations, should be developed with emphasis.

2. Conduct appropriate adjustment, rectification and improvement to the schools newly built in 1958. In order to guarantee the improvement of the teaching quality of schools at all levels, from the central government to the provinces, cities, autonomous regions, prefectures, and counties, it is necessary to designate a batch of schools with a better foundation as key schools among the full-time regular schools at all levels. The scale of these schools should not be too large, and there should be strict requirements on quality, and efforts should be made to run them well, achieve results, and create experience to drive other schools.

3. Make comprehensive and proper arrangements for teaching, productive labor (and scientific research for universities and colleges).

At present, it is necessary to summarize the experience of implementing the education policy over the past year, and re-formulate the guiding teaching plans or the basic principles of teaching plans for schools at all levels. The basic theoretical courses in universities and colleges should not be weakened. Middle and primary schools must use their greatest strength to improve the teaching quality of basic subjects and lay a solid foundation for cultural and scientific knowledge. Starting from this autumn, middle and primary schools should set the maximum and minimum limits of courses according to the conditions of teachers. Middle schools that set the maximum limit of courses, wherever conditions permit, should set up foreign language classes from the first year of junior high school and ensure that they are taught and learned well.

Productive labor should be listed as a formal course. The proportion of time spent on productive labor and teaching should be different for different types of schools. Full-time schools should focus on teaching, and appropriately arrange the time for productive labor in combination with the specific conditions of schools and majors at all levels and types, and the age characteristics of students.

Students participate in productive labor generally in three basic forms: one is to participate in labor in farms and factories run by schools; the second is to participate in labor in the countryside and factories arranged by schools; and the third is to participate in certain social public welfare labor. Productive labor that can be combined with teaching requirements should be combined as much as possible; those that cannot be combined or cannot be directly combined must also be carried out according to the prescribed time, and the tendency to belittle physical labor should not reoccur by one-sidedly emphasizing the combination of teaching. The existing productive labor bases of schools should be rectified and run well. Concrete productive labor plans and outlines should also be gradually drawn up according to possible conditions, stipulating the requirements for students and the necessary assessment system.

Mastering knowledge must be paid for with hard work, but if the learning burden is too heavy, it will affect the learning effect and even the health of students, so the phenomenon of excessive burden should be prevented.

4. Continue to strengthen ideological and political work and political theory education. Regarding political theory courses, in addition to continuing to study current affairs and policies in conjunction with current political tasks, and conscientiously carry out socialist and communist ideological and political education, it is also necessary to strengthen systematic Marxist-Leninist theoretical education, and combine this education with current affairs and policy education and daily political and ideological work.

5. Seize the work of revising and compiling teaching materials. Revise the teaching outlines of basic subjects in middle and primary schools according to the Party's education policy, and compile general textbooks. Organize school forces to review and compile teaching outlines and textbooks for universities and colleges, and select better teaching materials for recommendation and publication.

6. Universities and colleges should carry out scientific research work, taking teaching as the center, and continue to carry forward the spirit of the leap forward last year under the guidance of the socialist direction, and advocate "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend." At the same time, it is necessary to strengthen the cooperation between various aspects inside and outside the school in order to improve efficiency and reduce waste. Schools should formulate plans for scientific research work in a realistic manner according to teaching tasks, professional characteristics, their own conditions and development direction, and in conjunction with the needs of national production and construction and the school's productive labor.

7. Supplementing, cultivating and improving teachers, and building a large contingent of teachers who are both red and expert is the key to developing, consolidating and improving education. It is necessary to correctly implement the Party's policy on intellectuals, and mobilize all the forces of existing teachers to serve the socialist education cause. And it is necessary to actively take various effective measures, and organize teachers' spare-time further studies in a planned way, to improve the political and professional level of existing teachers. At the same time, it is also necessary to actively cultivate new teachers. Adopt the method of combining long-term cultivation and short-term training, develop and run various types of teacher training education at all levels, in order to vigorously cultivate teachers for middle and primary schools and kindergartens. The cultivation of university and college teachers must also adopt the method of "walking on two legs." In addition to retaining some graduates as teaching assistants and cultivating them in their work, all universities and colleges with conditions, especially key universities and colleges, should assume the task of cultivating graduate students and advanced teachers. At the same time, continue to select and send graduate students or advanced students to study abroad in order to cultivate backbone teachers with higher scientific and technological levels.

Correctly handling the relationship between teachers and students is of great significance to improving teaching work. In teaching work, it is necessary to give play to the leading role of teachers and to fully mobilize the initiative and creativity of students, so as to achieve mutual teaching and learning. This requires teachers to earnestly assume the task of "preaching," "imparting knowledge," and "solving doubts," to love students, to have strict requirements on students, and to pay attention to listening to their opinions and improving teaching work. Students should respect teachers, humbly learn, and can also make criticisms and suggestions to teachers in appropriate ways. In our schools, such a teacher-student relationship is growing, and educators have a responsibility to make it further develop more healthily.

Experience tells us that the Party's leadership is the fundamental guarantee of all our victories. The reason why China's education was able to achieve great achievements in 1958 is that the decisive condition was the establishment and strengthening of the Party's leadership on the cultural and educational front. The leap forward in production has driven the cultural revolution, there is a clear direction, the mass line is followed, the combination of popularization and improvement, and "walking on two legs," thus giving full play to the enthusiasm of all parties, which is the source of our great strength.

The task of 1959 requires us to greatly improve the quality of our work. As long as we resolutely rely on the Party's leadership, rely on the masses, sum up experience, correct shortcomings, and improve our work, we will surely be able to successfully complete the task.

    教育事业的深刻革命和空前发展
    教育部杨秀峰部长的发言主席、各位代表：
    我完全同意周恩来总理的政府工作报告和李富春副总理、李先念副总理、彭真副委员长的报告。
    首先让我欢呼英勇的人民解放军讨平西藏叛匪所取得的重大胜利！随着西藏叛匪的即将全部消灭，西藏人民将经过逐步的民主改革，和全国各族人民一起走上民主的社会主义的光明大道。这是西藏人民和国内其他各族人民非常高兴的事情。英帝国主义者和印度扩张主义分子，妄想把西藏从祖国分裂出去的阴谋，已经遭到可耻的失败。他们又企图利用他们所制造的所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”来掀起一个污蔑、反对新中国的浪潮，在世界人民面前，歪曲我国政府平定西藏叛乱的真象，这种阴谋也很快破产了。我国政府十分珍视中印两国的友好关系，但是，这种友好关系现在正受到来自印度扩张主义分子的破坏。一切帝国主义者和反动派应该清楚：站起来的中国六亿人民决不容忍他人干涉中国内政，破坏中国领土的完整。中国人民将用最大的积极性来完成和超额完成今年的国民经济计划，加速社会主义建设，增强国力，巩固国防，来回答帝国主义者及反动派的阴谋和叫嚣！
    关于过去几年，特别是去年教育工作取得的巨大成就，以及今后文化教育战线上的任务，周总理都讲得很清楚了。我现在只就一年来贯彻执行教育工作方针方面谈一点个人的体会，并着重对一九五九年教育工作的安排讲一些意见。请各位代表指正。
    一九五八年我国教育事业有两个突出的进展：一是实行了教育和生产劳动相结合的方针，从而展开了教育事业的巨大的深刻的革命；一是实行了全党全民办学的群众路线，采取了“两条腿走路”的方针，使教育事业得到了空前的发展。
    教育和生产劳动相结合，是教育事业的深刻革命
    实行教育和生产劳动相结合，是“培养全面发展的人类的唯一方法”，是培养“有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者”的必由之路。一九五八年各级学校师生，由勤工俭学到大办工厂农场，下乡下厂，投入全民大炼钢铁和秋收秋耕秋种运动，不仅支援了我国工农业生产的大跃进，为国家创造了物质财富，更重要的是使学校师生改造了思想。他们过去轻视体力劳动、轻视劳动人民的剥削阶级观点有了很大的改变，劳动观点和群众观点加强了，社会主义和共产主义觉悟提高了。他们这样总结自己的收获：“磨破了手掌，改变了立场；晒黑了脸皮，炼红了思想。”改变立场，炼红思想，这正是我们社会主义教育的首要要求。
    凡是教育与生产劳动结合得好的，文化科学知识的教学质量都获得了提高，学生的独立工作能力也有所增强。这因为教师学生通过生产劳动的实践，获得感性知识和工农业生产的操作技能，教的人比较容易结合实际，学的人也就比以前容易学得深透而牢固。
    由于生产实践的推动，高等学校的科学研究工作以及部分中等技术学校和高级中学的科学活动，有了空前的开展。据不完全统计，高等学校去年一年完成的科学研究项目，为1957年完成项目的十倍以上，所取得的成果超过了解放后八年的总和。在最新科学技术的研究方面，也有了良好的开端。去年冬季在北京举行的“教育与生产劳动相结合展览会”上所显示的成就，的确表现出一个万马奔腾的大跃进的局面。
    教师和学生参加生产劳动以后，结合着群众体育运动和卫生运动的开展，体质普遍增强了，患病者大大减少了。
    以上事实有力地说明了党的教育方针的正确性，说明了全面地贯彻执行这个方针，必然能够使学生在德育、智育、体育各方面都得到发展，从而全面地提高教育质量。
    一年来，贯彻教育和生产劳动相结合方针的几条主要经验
    一年以来，我们在贯彻执行教育和生产劳动相结合的方针过程中，得到下面几条主要经验。
    第一，教育革命一定要以思想革命为基础。去年各级学校在整风和反右派斗争的胜利的基础上，开展了“双反”运动、红专大辩论、教育方针大辩论、批判资产阶级教育思想和学术思想等一系列“兴无灭资”的思想斗争。思想革命的深入，为教育革命准备了条件，没有思想革命的胜利，就不会有教育革命的胜利。今后贯彻执行党的教育方针，还必须在党的领导下继续不断地开展两条道路和两种方法的斗争。
    第二，贯彻执行教育和生产劳动相结合的方针，必须把生产劳动正式列入教育计划，明确其目的性，并且对教学、生产劳动和学生生活有计划地加以安排，把劳动实践和理论教学紧密地结合起来，使成为一个完整的教学过程。这是一个复杂的工作，需要具体细致地加以安排。去年秋季曾有一些学校，由于缺乏经验，教育计划安排得不够好，上课少了些，教学质量就未能获得应有的提高。目前已经注意改正。
    第三，正确解决理论与实践的关系问题，是全面贯彻教育方针的重要环节。贯彻执行教育方针以来，有力地扭转了理论脱离实际的倾向。但是不容忽视，轻视劳动、轻视实际的思想在不少师生中仍然存在，不是短期内所能清除的。同这种思想作斗争，仍然是今后长期内艰巨的任务。同时，片面地理解理论来自实践，只重视实际知识和直接经验，忽视理论知识和间接经验的思想倾向有了萌芽，也必须注意克服和防止。只有把生产劳动和教学、理论和实践正确地结合起来，才能全面地贯彻执行党的教育方针。
    当然，正像总理报告中所说的，“对于教育事业上的这样一个彻底的革命，我们现在还只具有初步的经验，工作中还有缺点，也还存在着一些需要进一步研究解决的问题。”特别有些具体作法还得进一步摸索研究，但是我们相信，只要方向正确，经过长期的努力，适应我国社会主义事业需要的新的教育制度必将逐步建立和完善起来。
    全民办学，使我国教育事业获得空前发展
    一九五八年，我国教育事业得到了空前的发展。这一年内，在六千万人口中进行了扫盲工作，超过了过去八年的扫盲成绩；工矿企业和人民公社举办了各级各类的业余学校，参加学习的约达三千万人；这不能不说是一件大事。幼儿教育发展很快，入园幼儿达到三千多万，比一九五七年增加了二十七倍多。小学生达到八千六百万人，比一九五七年增加了百分之三十四。中等教育方面：普通中学学生达到八百五十二万人，比一九五七年增加了百分之三十六；中等专业学校学生达到一百四十七万人，比一九五七年增加了百分之八十九；一九五八年新创办的农业中学和其他职业中学，入学人数达到二百余万人；合计中等学校学生比一九五七年增加了百分之七十。高等学校学生达到六十六万人，比一九五七年增加了百分之五十。我国教育事业能够有这样空前的发展，是党的建设社会主义总路线的胜利，是党的群众路线的胜利，也是贯彻执行“两条腿走路”的发展方针的胜利。
    一九五八年教育事业全面大跃进的经验证明：去年党中央和国务院发布的关于教育工作的指示中提出的一整套“两条腿走路”的方针，为我国教育事业的发展指明了广阔的道路。只有充分发挥中央各部门、各地方和广大群众的办学的积极性，在“全国一盘棋”和领导与群众相结合的原则下，合理地安排全日制、半日制、业余的三类学校，才能多快好省地发展教育事业；才能在比较短的时间内，在我们这样一个“一穷二白”、人口众多的国家里普及教育，培养出一支数以千万计的又红又专的工人阶级知识分子队伍。
    实行全日制、半日制和业余的三类学校并举，不仅可以多快好省地发展教育事业，而且在当前生产任务繁重和劳动力紧张的情况下，可以分别满足广大青年和成年人提高文化的要求。随着劳动生产率的逐步提高和劳动时间的逐步缩短，全日制学校将会逐渐增加起来，成年人的业余学习时间，也将逐步增多。
    我们在教育事业的发展中，必须坚持普及与提高相结合的原则。忽视普及或忽视提高，都难于迅速改变我国文化落后的面貌，达到科学和文化的高涨。只有采用大量普及、部分提高的“两条腿走路”的方针，我们才能适当地解决数量和质量的矛盾。我们用发展半日制学校、业余学校和厂矿办学等办法，来满足普及的需要；另一方面，提高各级全日制学校的质量，并且在全日制学校当中，挑出一批学校，作为重点，着重提高质量，使成为教育事业中的骨干。这样合理使用有限的力量，既照顾普及，又注意提高，既顾到数量，又顾到质量，教育的发展才具有主动性。
    今年应该做好的几项工作
    根据周总理报告中提出的文教战线上的任务，今年教育工作的主要任务，应该是调动一切积极因素，在去年大发展的基础上，着重整顿巩固，适当发展；进一步全面地贯彻执行教育方针，大力提高教育质量。为了顺利完成这个任务，我以为应该做好以下几项工作：
    一、关于教育事业的发展。继续积极地、热心地开展扫除青壮年文盲的运动。巩固和发展各种业余学校，组织已经摆脱文盲状态的青壮年继续学习，以巩固和提高扫盲成果。发展业余教育必须从服务生产出发，并且要照顾到劳动力紧张的情况，结合生产任务和中心工作进行教学，作到生产、学习两不误。
    在基本上普及了小学教育的地方，着重做好巩固提高工作；还没有普及小学教育的地方，要积极进行普及工作。各种半日制中学，一般应该巩固提高、适当发展。高中和各级师范学校，以及基础薄弱地区的高等学校，应当有重点地发展。
    二，对于一九五八年新建的学校，要进行适当的调整、整顿和提高。为了保证提高各级学校的教学质量，从中央到省、市、自治区、专署、县，都要在各级全日制正规学校中，分别指定一批基础较好的作为重点学校。这批学校的规模不宜过大，在质量上应有严格要求，并且应该努力办好，作出成绩，创造经验，带动其他学校。
    三、对教学、生产劳动（高等学校还有科学研究）进行全面的、妥善的安排。
    目前需要总结一年来贯彻执行教育方针的经验，重新制定各级学校的指导性教学计划或教学计划的基本原则。高等学校的基础理论课不应削弱。中、小学必须用最大的力量来提高基本学科的教学质量，扎扎实实打好文化科学知识的基础。从今年秋季起，中、小学要根据师资条件，分别设置最高限度和最低限度的课程。设置最高限度课程的中学，凡有条件的，从初中一年级起，都应当设置外国语课，并且保证教好、学好。
    生产劳动应该列为正式课程。不同类型的学校，生产劳动和教学的时间所占比重应有所不同。全日制学校应以教学为主，结合各级各类学校和专业的具体情况、学生的年龄特点等来适当安排生产劳动的时间。
    学生参加生产劳动，一般有三种基本形式：一是在学校举办的农场和工厂中参加劳动；二是由学校安排，下乡、下厂参加劳动；三是参加一定的社会公益劳动。生产劳动能与教学要求结合进行的，应当尽可能结合；不能结合或不能直接结合的，也必须按规定时间进行，不应片面强调结合教学而重新发生轻视体力劳动的倾向。学校现有的生产劳动基地，应当加以整顿，切实办好。还应该根据可能条件，逐步订出具体的生产劳动计划和大纲，规定出对学生的要求和必要的考核制度。
    掌握知识必须付出艰苦的劳动，但是如果学习负担过重，反而会影响学习效果，甚至会影响学生的健康，所以负担过重的现象应该注意防止。
    四、继续加强思想政治工作和政治理论教育。关于政治理论课，除继续结合当前的政治任务学习时事政策，认真地进行社会主义、共产主义的思想政治教育外，还必须加强系统的马克思列宁主义的理论教育，并且把这种教育和时事政策教育、日常政治思想工作结合起来。
    五、抓紧修订和编审教材的工作。根据党的教育方针，修订中、小学基本学科的教学大纲，并编写通用教科书。组织学校力量审查和编写高等学校的教学大纲和教材，从中选择较好的教材推荐出版。
    六、高等学校开展科学研究工作，应当以教学为中心，在社会主义方向的指导下，继续发扬去年的跃进精神，提倡“百花齐放、百家争鸣”。同时，要加强校内校外各方面的协作，以提高效率，减少浪费。学校应该根据教学任务、专业特点、本身条件和发展方向，并且结合国家生产建设需要和本校的生产劳动，实事求是地制订科学研究工作的计划。
    七、补充、培养和提高师资，建立一支宏大的又红又专的教师队伍，是发展、巩固和提高教育事业的关键。要正确地贯彻执行党的知识分子政策，调动现有教师的一切力量为社会主义的教育事业服务。并且要积极地采取各种有效措施，有计划地组织教师的业余进修，提高现有教师的政治和业务水平。同时，还必须积极地培养新师资。采取长期培养和短期训练并举的办法，发展并办好各级各类师范教育，以大力培养中、小学和幼儿园的师资。高等学校师资的培养，也必须采取“两条腿走路”的办法。除了留一部分毕业生作助教，在工作中培养外，一切有条件的高等学校，特别是重点高等学校，要担负培养研究生和进修教师的任务。同时继续选派出国留学的研究生或进修生，以培养有较高科学技术水平的骨干教师。
    正确地处理师生关系，对改进教学工作有重要的意义。在教学工作中，既要发挥教师的主导作用，又要充分发挥学生的积极性和创造性，作到教学相长。这就要求教师认真担负起“传道”、“授业”、“解惑”的任务，爱护学生，对学生有严格要求，同时注意听取他们的意见，改进教学工作。学生要尊敬教师，虚心学习，同时也可以采取适当的方式对教师提出批评和建议。在我们的学校中，这样的师生关系正在成长，教育工作者有责任使它进一步得到更健康的发展。
    经验告诉我们，党的领导是我们一切胜利的根本保证。一九五八年我国教育事业所以能够获得巨大的成就，决定性的条件是在文教战线上确立和加强了党的领导。生产跃进带动了文化革命，有明确的方向，走群众路线，普及与提高相结合，“两条腿走路”，因而充分发挥了各方面的积极性，这就是我们巨大力量的源泉。
    一九五九年的任务，要求我们在工作质量上大大提高一步。只要坚决依靠党的领导，依靠群众，总结经验，改正缺点，提高工作，我们就一定能够胜利地完成任务。
