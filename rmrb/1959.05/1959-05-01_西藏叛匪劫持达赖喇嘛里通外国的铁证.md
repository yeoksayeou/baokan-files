Ironclad Proof of Tibetan Bandits Kidnapping the Dalai Lama and Colluding with Foreign Countries

The two reactionary documents, "Opinions of Nangma Kanchen Khenchung" and "Opinions of the Three Major Monasteries," seized by the People's Liberation Army from Gunggadele Linka (one of Tibet's famous monasteries, formerly the site of the bandit headquarters) during the suppression of the rebellion, prove that the Dalai Lama was kidnapped and surrounded by the rebel elements during the rebellion, and lost his freedom of movement.

Left picture: One of the reactionary documents seized in Gunggadele Linka - "Opinions of Nangma Kanchen Khenchung" (Nangma means the Dalai Lama's attendants, Kanchen is a fourth-rank monk official, and Khenchung is a fourth-rank secular official. "Nangma Kanchen Khenchung" refers to the fourth-rank officials in charge of affairs around the Dalai Lama). The document reveals that the Dalai Lama was angry because reactionary elements prevented him from going to the military district auditorium to see a play, and it reveals that reactionary elements deployed a large number of armed personnel to put the Dalai Lama under house arrest.
　　The Chinese translation of the document can be found on page 3 of this newspaper on April 28.

Lower picture two: Another reactionary document seized in Gunggadele Linka, "Opinions of the Three Major Monasteries" (the Three Major Monasteries are Drepung, Sera, and Ganden Monasteries, which were once the main nests of the bandits). This document reveals the conspiracy of the reactionary elements and the former Tibetan local government (i.e., the Kashag) to kidnap the Dalai Lama, prevent the Dalai Lama from moving freely, and oppose national regional autonomy, and attempt to achieve "independence."
　　The Chinese translation of the document can be found on page 3 of this newspaper on April 28.

Top picture: This is the draft of a secret telegram sent by the Tibetan rebel bandits in the name of the so-called "All-People Congress of the Independent State of Tibet" to Shakabpa, one of the heads of the Tibetan rebel bandits in Kalimpong, on the 8th day of the second month of the Tibetan calendar (i.e., March 17th, Gregorian calendar).

Middle picture: This is the draft of a secret telegram sent by Tudenliemen, one of the heads of the Tibetan rebel bandits, to Shakabpa, one of the heads of the Tibetan rebel bandits in Kalimpong, on the 7th day of the second month of the Tibetan calendar (i.e., March 16th, Gregorian calendar).

    西藏叛匪劫持达赖喇嘛里通外国的铁证
    在平息叛乱中，人民解放军从功德林（西藏著名的寺院之一，曾经是叛匪司令部所在地）缴获的“囊玛堪钦堪穷的意见书”和“三大寺的意见书”两份反动文件，证明达赖喇嘛在叛乱过程中遭到叛乱分子的劫持和包围，失去了行动自由。　　　　　（新华社稿）（附图片）
    左图：在功德林缴获的反动文件之一——“囊玛堪钦堪穷的意见书”（囊玛意为达赖喇嘛的侍从，堪钦是大四品僧官，堪穷为四品僧俗官员。“囊玛堪钦堪穷”是指达赖身边管事务的四品官员）。文件中透露达赖喇嘛因反动分子阻挡他去军区礼堂看戏而发怒，并且透露反动分子布置大量武装人员软禁达赖喇嘛。

    下图二：在功德林缴获的另一份反动文件“三大寺的意见书”（三大寺即哲蚌、色拉、噶丹寺，曾经是叛匪的主要窠穴）。这份文件透露了反动分子和原西藏地方政府（即噶厦）劫持达赖喇嘛、不准达赖喇嘛自由行动，以及反对民族区域自治、妄图“独立”等阴谋。
