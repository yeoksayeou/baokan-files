Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 25th: The Lü Fengqi bricklaying group of the Taiyuan First Construction Engineering Company, from 1952 to the present, has built chimneys and water towers ranging from 20 to 50 meters in height, buildings of three to five stories, and factory buildings ranging from 12 to 16 meters in height. They have not only ensured the quality and quantity of construction tasks, but have also never had any safety accidents.

For nearly eight years, this group has consistently educated new workers on safe production. In addition to the education provided by Party, League, and administrative organizations, many experienced veteran workers often use their own experiences to explain to new workers that neglecting safety is detrimental to the country, to the individual, and to the construction of socialism. They say: The Party and the country are very concerned about the workers, and we ourselves should be even more concerned. Only with safe production can we better complete our tasks. Therefore, all workers in the group are very vigilant about production accidents.

Strengthening production management and implementing the responsibility system are important guarantees for the group's safe production. The group has established a comprehensive responsibility system for the group leader and selected workers to serve as safety inspectors. Before going to work each day, the group leader and safety inspector carefully inspect the site. If they find any loose ropes or untied bindings on the scaffolding boards or poles, they will fix them. If they find any major problems with the scaffolding, they will ask the scaffolders to re-tie it. During the operation, the safety inspector constantly pays attention to whether the materials stacked on the scaffolding exceed the load-bearing capacity of the scaffolding. At the end of each day, the group leader and safety inspector, in cooperation with the technical workers, conduct a rigorous inspection and assessment of the construction work done that day.

When formulating production plans, the Lü Fengqi group specifically formulates safety measures based on different working conditions, organizes workers to discuss and implement them, and frequently checks the implementation. They also stipulate that a quality and safety activity meeting should be held once a week to discuss the quality and safety situation in production that week, learn safety operating procedures, and conduct debates and criticisms of erroneous ideas such as neglecting quality and safety.

    吕凤岐小组八年没有出事故
    新华社太原25日电  太原市第一建筑工程公司吕凤岐瓦工小组，从1952年到现在，建筑过二十公尺至五十公尺高的烟囱、水塔，三层至五层高的大楼，十二公尺至十六公尺高的厂房，不仅做到了保质保量地完成施工任务，而且从来没有发生过任何安全事故。
    这个小组近八年来经常对新工人进行安全生产的教育。除了党、团、行政组织进行教育以外，许多老师傅常常以亲身的经历向新工人说明：忽视安全，对国家、对个人、对建设社会主义都不利。他们说：党和国家对工人十分关心，我们自己更该关心，只有安全生产，才能更好地完成任务。因此，全组工人都对生产事故很警惕。
    加强生产管理，贯彻责任制，是这个小组安全生产的重要保证。这个小组建立了组长全面负责制，选拔工人担任安全检查员。每天上班以前，组长和安全员都要到现场进行仔细检查，如发现架板、架杆有脱绳、松绑的地方，就动手整理；发现脚手架有重大的毛病，就请架工重绑。在操作过程中，安全员时刻注意检查架上堆放的材料是否超过了架子的负荷能力。每天下班时，组长、安全员配合技术工人，对当日施工的工程进行严格的检查和鉴定。
    吕凤岐小组在每次制订生产计划的时候，都要根据不同的工作条件，具体订出保证安全的措施，组织工人讨论后执行，并且经常检查执行的情况。他们还规定每周开一次质量安全活动会议，讨论本周生产中的质量、安全情况，学习安全操作规程，对忽视质量、安全等错误思想展开辩论、批判。
