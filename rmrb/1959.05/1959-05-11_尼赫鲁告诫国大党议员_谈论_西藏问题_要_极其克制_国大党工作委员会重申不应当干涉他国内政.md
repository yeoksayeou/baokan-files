Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, May 9th: According to a report by the Indian Press Trust, Indian Prime Minister Nehru, on May 9th, cautioned Congress Party members of parliament returning to their constituencies at the end of the parliamentary budget session to exercise "extreme restraint" when expressing opinions on the Tibet issue.

The Indian parliamentary budget session began on February 9th this year, lasting thirteen weeks.

Speaking at a farewell meeting of the Congress Party parliamentary group, Nehru expressed regret at the tone of some speeches during the People's Assembly debate on the so-called "Tibet issue" on May 8th. He said that Congress Party members should not imitate them and should be cautious in their speeches.

It is reported that Nehru had expressed concern that some people might make irresponsible remarks at the so-called "All India Tibet Convention." This conference, initiated by the leaders of the Indian People's Socialist Party and other parties, is planned to be held in Calcutta at the end of this month.

The Indian Press Trust reported that Nehru reiterated that the Tibet issue is a very difficult and delicate issue. Overall, India's attitude towards this issue is generally understood in all places.

Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, May 10th: The Indian Congress Working Committee passed a resolution on the 9th, stating, "The committee reaffirms India's basic policy of maintaining friendly relations with all countries and not participating in any military blocs, and reiterates that it should not interfere in the internal affairs of other countries, which is one of the five principles of Panchsheel. The committee earnestly hopes to maintain friendly relations with China and sincerely hopes that a peaceful environment will soon be established in Tibet."

The resolution stated, "The recent events in Tibet have aroused great concern and sympathy among the broad masses of people in India." The resolution believes that "due to the existence of neighboring relations, and because many places in Tibet have been a part of the religious and cultural consciousness of the Indian people since ancient times, this situation is very natural."

The resolution stated, "The Working Committee fully supports the Indian government's policy as outlined in Prime Minister (Nehru)'s speech to Parliament."

The resolution stated that the Working Committee "approves of granting asylum to the Dalai Lama, who is deeply respected in India, and granting asylum to the large number of refugees from Tibet."

The two-day meeting of the committee ended here on the 9th, and the Indian Congress Party National Committee meeting will open on the 10th.

    尼赫鲁告诫国大党议员
    谈论“西藏问题”要“极其克制”
    国大党工作委员会重申不应当干涉他国内政
    新华社新德里9日电　据印度报业托辣斯报道，印度总理尼赫鲁5月9日告诫在国会预算会议结束时返回自己选区的国大党议员们，要他们就西藏事件发表意见时要“极其克制”。
    印度国会预算会议是今年2月9日开始的。会期十三个星期。
    尼赫鲁在国大党本届议会党团的告别会上发表讲话时表示，他对5月8日人民院辩论所谓“西藏问题”时有些人讲话的语调感到遗憾。他说国大党人不应该模仿他们，国大党人在讲话时应该慎重。
    据悉尼赫鲁曾经表示担心在所谓“全印西藏会议”上可能有些人发表一些讲话也许是不负责的。这个由印度人民社会党和其它一些政党的首脑们发起的会议打算在本月底在加尔各答举行。
    印度报业托辣斯报道说，尼赫鲁重申西藏问题是非常困难微妙的问题。总的说来，印度对这个问题的态度在各个地方是得到普遍了解的。
    新华社新德里10日电　印度国大党工作委员会在9日通过决议说，“委员会重新肯定了印度的基本政策——同一切国家保持友好关系和不参加任何军事集团的政策，并且重申不应当干涉别国的内政，这是潘查希拉五项原则之一。委员会切望同中国保持友好关系，并且真诚希望很快就会在西藏建立和平的环境。”
    决议说，“最近在西藏发生的事件在印度广大人民中间引起了很大的关切和同情。”决议认为，“由于存在着毗邻的关系，由于西藏的许多地方从远古以来就一直是印度人民宗教和文化意识的一部分，这种情况是很自然的。”
    决议说，“工作委员会完全支持（尼赫鲁）总理向议会发表的讲话中所阐明的印度政府的政策。”
    决议说，工作委员会“赞成给予在印度深受尊敬的达赖喇嘛避难权以及给予来自西藏的大批难民避难权的做法。”
  　委员会历时两天的会议9日在这里结束，印度国大党全国委员会会议将在10日开幕。
