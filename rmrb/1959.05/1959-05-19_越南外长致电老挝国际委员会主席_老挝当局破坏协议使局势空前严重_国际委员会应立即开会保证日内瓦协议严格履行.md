Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, May 18th: Vietnamese Minister of Foreign Affairs Pham Van Dong sent a telegram on May 17th to Lieutenant General Tara Singh Bal, Chairman of the International Commission for Supervision and Control in Laos, currently stationed in Saigon, stating: "The situation in Laos has undergone extremely worrying changes due to the Lao Royal Government's deliberate violation of the Geneva Accords and the increasing intensification of these violations."

The telegram stated: "While violating the military clauses of the Geneva Accords on Laos, the Lao Royal Government has strengthened its suppression, unwarranted arrests, and maltreatment of former resistance personnel, actions which have now reached an unprecedentedly serious level."

"Former Pathet Lao Fighting Units stationed in Xieng Khouang and Luang Prabang, who have been awaiting genuine integration into the Lao National Army, are being closely surrounded by well-equipped Royal Army troops and have all sources of supply cut off; patriotic party local leaders have been detained; and party leaders, including Prince Souphanouvong, are under close surveillance. This situation will clearly lead to extremely dangerous consequences."

The telegram stated: "In order to defend peace in Laos and Indochina, and to ensure the democratic freedoms enjoyed by former resistance personnel as stipulated in the agreement signed between the Lao Royal Government and the former Pathet Lao Fighting Units, it is more necessary than ever for the International Commission for Supervision and Control in Laos to resume its activities to ensure that the Geneva Accords are respected and strictly implemented. As a signatory to the Geneva Accords, and recognizing the responsibilities conferred by the Geneva Accords, the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam strongly opposes the above-mentioned serious violations of the Geneva Accords, and once again requests the Chairman of the International Commission for Supervision and Control in Laos to take measures to convene a commission meeting as soon as possible."

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, May 18th: Hanoi newspapers today published commentaries, strongly condemning the Lao Royal Government for further undermining the Geneva Accords on Laos and peace in Indochina under the instigation of U.S. imperialism.

The "People's Daily" commentary stated: "The Lao Royal Government has now taken a step further down the road of undermining the Geneva Accords on Laos." The commentary said that the Phoui Sananikone government slandered the former Pathet Lao Fighting Units for opposing the government, and used this as a pretext to surround the former Pathet Lao Fighting Units with Royal Army troops, surround the residences of leaders of the former Pathet Lao Fighting Units such as Prince Souphanouvong, and prepare to disarm the former Pathet Lao Fighting Units. The Lao Royal Government also arrested commanders of the former Pathet Lao Fighting Units and members of the Lao Patriotic Party.

The commentary pointed out that this behavior of the Phoui Sananikone government creates conditions for U.S. imperialism to further interfere in Laos, allowing U.S. imperialism to turn Laos into a U.S. military base in order to realize its conspiracy to provoke Laos' neighbors.

The "Capital Hanoi News" commentary said that the recent conspiracy of the Phoui Sananikone government is part of a series of reactionary conspiracies planned by this government under the direction of the United States. The "New Era News" commentary analyzed the severity of the current situation in Laos and pointed out that the resumption of the Lao International Commission's activities is a matter of utmost urgency.

    越南外长致电老挝国际委员会主席
    老挝当局破坏协议使局势空前严重
    国际委员会应立即开会保证日内瓦协议严格履行
    新华社河内18日电　越南民主共和国外交部部长范文同17日打电报给现驻西贡的老挝国际监察和监督委员会主席塔拉·辛格·巴尔中将说：“由于老挝王国政府有意违反日内瓦协议和日益加剧这种违反行为，老挝局势发生了令人十分忧虑的变化。”
    电报说：“在违反关于老挝的日内瓦协议的军事条款的同时，老挝王国政府加强了对前抗战人员的镇压、无理逮捕和虐待行动，目前这些行动到了空前严重的程度。”
    “驻扎在川圹和琅勃拉邦、一直等待着切实并入老挝国家军队的前寮国战斗部队，被装备齐全的王国军队严密地包围和切断一切供应来源；爱国党地方领导人被拘留；党的领袖，包括苏发努冯亲王在内，受到严密的监视。这种情况很显然将带来极其危险的后果。”
    电报说：“为了保卫老挝和印度支那的和平，为了使老挝王国政府同前寮国战斗部队签订的协议中所规定的前抗战人员享有的民主自由权得到保障，老挝国际监察和监督委员会恢复活动以保证日内瓦协议得到尊重和严格履行，已经比任何时候更加必要了。作为日内瓦协议签字国之一，并且认识到日内瓦协议所赋予的责任，越南民主共和国政府极力反对上述严重违反日内瓦协议的行动，并且再一次要求老挝国际监察和监督委员会主席采取措施以便能够在最短期内召开委员会会议。”
    新华社河内18日电　河内各报今天发表评论，严厉谴责老挝王国政府在美帝国主义唆使下，正在进一步破坏关于老挝的日内瓦协议和印度支那的和平。
    “人民报”的评论说：“老挝王国政府现在已经在破坏关于老挝的日内瓦协议的道路上前进了一步”。评论说，培·萨纳尼空政府诬蔑前寮国战斗部队反对政府，并以这种借口来用王国军队包围前寮国战斗部队，包围苏发努冯亲王等前寮国战斗部队领袖的住宅，还准备把前寮国战斗部队缴械。老挝王国政府还逮捕了前寮国战斗部队的指挥员和老挝爱国党党员。
    评论指出，培·萨纳尼空政府的这种行为为美帝国主义进一步干涉老挝创造条件，让美帝国主义把老挝变为美国的军事基地，以便实现向老挝的邻国挑衅的阴谋。
    “首都河内报”的评论说，培·萨纳尼空政府最近的阴谋是这个政府在美国指使下策划的一系列反动阴谋的一部分。“新时代报”的评论分析了目前老挝形势的严重性，并且指出，恢复老挝国际委员会的活动是刻不容缓的事情。
