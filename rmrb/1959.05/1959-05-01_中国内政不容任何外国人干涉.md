Comrade Chairman, fellow members:

I wholeheartedly endorse Premier Zhou's "Report on the Work of the Government," Vice Premier Li Fuchun's "Report on the Draft National Economic Plan for 1959," and Vice Premier Li Xiannian's "Report on the State Final Accounts for 1958 and the Draft State Budget for 1959." I fully agree with Vice Chairman Peng Zhen's "Work Report of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China" and Vice Chairman Li Weihan's "Work Report of the Standing Committee of the Second National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference."

The simultaneous convening of the First Session of the Second National People's Congress and the First Session of the Third National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference in Beijing is a major event in the current political life of our people. It vividly demonstrates the great unity of the people of all nationalities in our country under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, and will undoubtedly play a huge role in mobilizing the people of the whole country to realize this year's Great Leap Forward.

Cheering the Great Changes of the Decade and the Great Achievements of the Great Leap Forward

Before the conference, I accompanied several delegates and members to various places for inspection, and personally witnessed the inspiring changes in all aspects of our country, the soaring enthusiasm of the broad working people, and the great achievements on all fronts. One cannot help but feel elated and deeply appreciate that the Great Leap Forward of 1958 is as astonishing as a miracle before us! At this meeting, we also listened to Premier Zhou's "Report on the Work of the Government," which comprehensively summarized the achievements and experiences of China's Great Leap Forward in 1958. Based on my personal experience and insights during the inspection, I strongly agree with the views of some delegates and members that Premier Zhou's report is an "epic of heroes" summarizing the achievements of China's Great Leap Forward. We have every reason to believe that through the discussion and study of Premier Zhou's report, we will further mobilize the enthusiasm of all parties, strengthen the unity of the people of the whole country, and vigorously encourage the people of the whole country to complete and overfulfill the grand National Economic Plan for 1959.

Fellow members, countless facts have proven that our country is more prosperous and flourishing than at any time in the past. Many members present, like me, are elderly people over sixty years old. We have lived in the old society for a long time, and we know the face of old China relatively clearly. Looking back at the situation in old China and looking at the thriving scene everywhere in the motherland now, and then thinking about how these earth-shaking changes have only taken place in ten years, the joy of us old people is truly beyond words. In the past, I often said that the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao was correct, great, and wise, leading the people to win victory after victory. However, I did not expect that in less than two years after the nationwide rectification campaign and the anti-Rightist struggle, such brilliant achievements and major victories could be achieved. From this, I feel that my understanding of the correctness of the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, the superiority of the socialist system, and the wisdom and strength of the working people after liberation is insufficient, and my thinking is far behind the development of the situation. What moves us even more is that the Party and Chairman Mao teach us not to be satisfied with the achievements we have already made. The Party believes that compared to the poverty-stricken yesterday of the old society, our country has indeed undergone earth-shaking changes, but compared to the great tomorrow, the existing achievements are insignificant. In orderto build our country into a great socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and a modern science and culture, we still need the people of the whole country to make very arduous efforts. From this, I have a deeper understanding of the greatness and correctness of the Party and Chairman Mao. With such a great party and the leadership of such a wise leader, we feel proud, we are full of confidence, and we will surely be able to achieve even greater achievements and move towards a beautiful, prosperous, and happy communist society.

Fellow members, all the great achievements that have been and will be made are not accidental. The great unity of the more than six hundred million people under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao is an important guarantee for our country's continuous victories in revolutionary struggles and production construction. As Premier Zhou pointed out in his report, the foundation of the great unity of the people of our country is the alliance of workers and peasants. In order to mobilize all positive factors to serve socialist construction, the Party, while constantly strengthening the worker-peasant alliance, has united all who can be united and constantly consolidated and developed the alliance between the working people and all non-working people who can cooperate. Participating in this conference has made me further realize that through the people's commune movement and the Great Leap Forward of the entire socialist cause, the worker-peasant alliance in our country has been unprecedentedly consolidated; through the nationwide rectification campaign and the anti-Rightist struggle, the unity within the people has been further strengthened, and the people's democratic united front in our country has been newly consolidated and developed under the socialist premise. In 1956, the Party put forward the policy of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision" with the democratic parties. The purpose of the Party's proposal of this policy was to further consolidate the Party's leadership and the people's democratic dictatorship, and to unite all who can be united to serve socialist construction. In the summer of 1957, the bourgeois Rightists distorted this policy, taking advantage of the opportunity to help the Communist Party to rectify its work style, and launched a frenzied attack on the Party, the people, and socialism. In order to safeguard the Party's leadership and the socialist cause, the people of the whole country, under the leadership of the Party, repelled the attack of the bourgeois Rightists; our Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, under the leadership of the Communist Party and with the support of the broad masses of the people, also smashed the Rightist alliance headed by Zhang Bojun, Huang Qixiang, and Li Boqiu. Now the facts are becoming increasingly clear that it was very correct for the Party to lead the people of the whole country to struggle against the bourgeois Rightists. The Party truly turned bad things into good things, and through the struggle against the Rightists, it raised the people's awareness, strengthened the unity within the people, further consolidated the people's democratic dictatorship, and created very favorable conditions for implementing the policy of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision."

Organizing members of democratic parties to continue to reform through learning, work, and labor practice

To implement the policy of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision," from the perspective of our democratic parties, is essentially to continuously carry out self-reform in accordance with the six political criteria instructed by Chairman Mao, and to better serve socialist construction. The Party has always adhered to the policy of uniting, educating, and transforming bourgeois intellectuals, helping bourgeois intellectuals to carry out self-reform, and better serve socialism. In order to achieve this goal, the Party has created all favorable conditions for us, and with the changes in the situation of class struggle, has used different methods in helping bourgeois intellectuals to carry out reform. As Vice Chairman Li Weihan pointed out in his report: "In the anti-Rightist struggle and the rectification movement, the method of mass airing of views, free airing of views, big-character posters, and great debates was mainly adopted to conduct serious political and ideological criticism; in the situation where the frenzied attack of the Rightists was smashed and the rectification movement came to an end, the method of gentle breeze and fine rain was adopted to conduct patient and persuasive positive education, and criticism and self-criticism were appropriately carried out, so that their self-reform achieved remarkable results." I think this is very correct. From this passage of Vice Chairman Li Weihan, I realize: First, bourgeois intellectuals must continue to carry out self-reform; second, at present, positive education, gentle breeze and fine rain, and the method of convincing people with reason must be adhered to in the process of reform. Through the anti-Rightist struggle and the rectification movement, through learning, work, and labor training, indeed many people in our democratic parties have made progress to varying degrees, and many people are sincerely willing to accept the leadership of the Party and have already made achievements in serving socialism. Looking only at the members of our Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party in the field of medicine and health, in the past year or so, many of them have played a certain positive role in implementing the Party's policy on traditional Chinese medicine, in Western medicine learning traditional Chinese medicine, in the integration of traditional Chinese and Western medicine, and in uniting to serve the people's health cause. But it is also undeniable that most of the members have still not gotten rid of the intermediate state. Measured by the six political criteria instructed by Chairman Mao, they must still go through a relatively long period of self-reform. Therefore, it is very necessary to help organize members to continue to reform through learning, work, and labor practice. Experience tells us that the reform of members of democratic parties must be combined with service. More reform means more service. Reform is for service, and service can promote reform. The combination of service and reform is a correct principle that has been proven by practice. Under the leadership of the Communist Party organizations at all levels, many grass-roots organizations of our democratic parties have begun to make achievements and gain experience in this regard. Under the leadership of the Communist Party committees, these grass-roots organizations help members carry out self-reform around the central work of the units they are in, which not only promotes service but also improves political and ideological awareness, playing the role of the Party's assistant in uniting, educating, and reforming bourgeois intellectuals. From this, we have more reason to believe that as long as we truly accept the leadership of the Communist Party, our democratic parties can do a lot of work in promoting members to serve socialism and helping them continue to carry out self-reform, and we can certainly make many achievements. Continuing to advance along the socialist road, we will surely be able to realize the wish of "long-term coexistence and mutual supervision" put forward by the Communist Party.

Celebrating the new life of the Tibetan people, and warning Indian expansionists

Premier Zhou pointed out in his report: "The unification of the motherland is the highest interest of all nationalities in the country." This sentence expresses the common will and wish of the people of all nationalities in our country. Under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, and due to the correct implementation of the national policy, the unity among the various nationalities of our country has been greatly strengthened. Imperialism has always wanted to undermine this unity and attempt to undermine China's unification. The former Tibetan local government and the upper-level reactionary group, colluding with imperialism, the Chiang Kai-shek clique, and foreign reactionaries, launched an armed rebellion in Lhasa not long ago, betraying the motherland and undermining unification. This serious criminal act aroused the unparalleled anger of the people of all nationalities. In order to safeguard national unity and ethnic solidarity, all ethnic groups unanimously expressed their heartfelt support for the State Council's order to dissolve the former Tibetan local government, and expressed their respect for the troops of the Tibet Military Region of the People's Liberation Army who quickly quelled the Lhasa rebellion. We are happy to see that the rebellion launched by the Tibetan reactionary group has suffered a shameful defeat, and the monks and lay people of Tibet have since gained a new life, and in the future, it will be possible to get rid of the shackles of the most backward, darkest, and most brutal serf system and realize the desire for democratic autonomy and social progress. This is a great victory for our country's national unity policy, and we warmly hail this victory.

In order to quickly relieve the Tibetan people from the pain of the serf system, we believe that the backward social system in Tibet must be reformed. Premier Zhou pointed out in his report: "Regarding the future social reforms in Tibet, the central government will conduct full consultations with patriotic figures from the upper and middle classes of Tibet and the masses of people from all walks of life to determine the timing, steps, and methods of implementing the reforms. In any case, the reforms will be carried out gradually under full consideration of the characteristics of Tibet, and in the process of reform, the religious beliefs and customs of the Tibetan people will be fully respected, and the excellent culture of the Tibetan people will be respected and promoted." We believe that the central government's consideration is very thorough and correct, and we firmly believe that it will surely be warmly supported by the people of the whole country, especially the monks and lay people of Tibet.

Tibet is an inalienable part of Chinese territory; the suppression of the Tibetan rebellion is purely China's internal affair and brooks no foreign interference. Recently, imperialists and foreign reactionaries have used the Tibetan rebellion to maliciously slander and attack our country. This does not surprise us Chinese at all, because countless historical facts tell us that imperialists and foreign reactionaries have always been hostile to and conspired to undermine the unity and national unity of our motherland. What surprises and angers us is that after the failure of the rebellion launched by a small handful of reactionary elements in Tibet, they fled to India and further colluded with imperialists and foreign reactionaries in an attempt to carry out the conspiracy of so-called Tibetan "independence." In Tezpur, India, Indian diplomatic officials even distributed a so-called "statement by the Dalai Lama," openly proposing the "independence" of Tibet. Such a political document that openly attacked the Chinese government was actually distributed by Indian diplomatic officials. We cannot help but ask: Is this not openly allowing political activities against China to be carried out in India? And can such activities carried out in India find even a trace of conformity with the spirit of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence?

What is even more ridiculous: because the so-called "statement by the Dalai Lama" distributed by Indian diplomatic officials in Tezpur on April 18 was full of loopholes, arousing suspicion and refutation from all parties; on April 22, another so-called second "Dalai Lama statement" was issued in Mussoorie in the name of the Dalai Lama to quibble, claiming that the first statement was authorized by the Dalai Lama, and changed the third-person pronoun "he" used in the first statement to the first-person pronoun "I." Indian diplomatic official Menon insisted that the April 18 statement was written by the Dalai Lama himself. This is really an ugly performance, trying to cover up the truth.

Because the Dalai Lama himself admitted to the three letters written to our General Tan Guansan, it has given those who doubted these three letters a resounding slap in the face, but they still want to further slander that Panchen's speech at the National People's Congress is also fake. This is really a self-deceiving talk that expansionists have always been willing to believe. As everyone knows, the Dalai Lama's departure was originally being kidnapped by rebellious elements. The people of our entire country hope that he can get rid of the kidnapping and return to Tibet as soon as possible, but Mr. Nehru, the Prime Minister of our friendly neighbor India, is still kind enough to say that he is creating conditions for the Dalai Lama to return to his country. Isn't this a wonderful argument?

Fellow members, our country has always cherished the traditional friendship between China and India, but if anyone wants to use our cherished friendship to play with us and interfere in our country's internal affairs, that is absolutely intolerable!

From this, we cannot help but think that for a long time, the upper-level reactionary elements in Tibet have used Kalimpong in India as the center for carrying out conspiracies abroad, and some Indian politicians and expansionists have repeatedly expressed "sympathy" for the rebellious elements and "unease" over the Chinese government's suppression of the Tibetan rebellion. These are not accidental. In this regard, we want to remind certain expansionists in India to pay attention. Our government has always adhered to the principle of non-interference in other countries' internal affairs, and at the same time, we will never allow any foreign interference in our country's internal affairs. The era when China was bullied and manipulated by others is long gone, and any conspiracy to undermine China is doomed to failure.

Fellow members, our current meeting is a meeting that symbolizes the greater unity of the people of the whole country, a meeting of the Great Leap Forward, and a meeting to greet the tenth anniversary of the National Day by moving from victory to greater victory. Living in such a great era and participating in such an important meeting, we feel very honored and even more feel a great responsibility. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, and under the brilliant light of the general line for building socialism, let us unite and make double the efforts to complete and overfulfill the National Economic Plan for 1959.

    中国内政不容任何外国人干涉
    季方委员的发言主席、各位委员：
    周总理的“政府工作报告”、李富春副总理的“关于一九五九年国民经济计划草案的报告”和李先念副总理的“关于一九五八年国家决算和一九五九年国家预算草案的报告”，我表示衷心拥护；对彭真副委员长“中华人民共和国全国人民代表大会常务委员会的工作报告”和李维汉副主席的“中国人民政治协商会议第二届全国委员会常务委员会工作报告”，我表示完全同意。
    第二届全国人民代表大会第一次会议和中国人民政治协商会议第三届全国委员会第一次会议同时在北京召开，这是我国人民在当前政治生活中的一件大事，它生动的表明了我国各民族人民在中国共产党和毛泽东主席领导下的大团结，对于动员全国人民实现今年的大跃进，无疑将发挥巨大的作用。
    为十年的巨大变化和大跃进的伟大成就欢呼
    在大会以前，我曾随同几位代表和委员到几个地方去进行视察，亲眼看到了我们国家在各个方面所发生的动人心弦的变化，广大劳动人民的冲天干劲和各个战线上的巨大成就，不能不使人从心坎里感到欢欣鼓舞，深深体会到一九五八年的大跃进是摆在我们面前的奇迹一样地惊人！在这个会上我们又听了周总理的“政府工作报告”，全面地总结了一九五八年我国大跃进的成就和经验。根据我的亲身经历和在视察工作中的体验，我很同意一些代表和委员的看法：周总理的报告是一部总结我国大跃进成就的“英雄史诗”。我们完全有理由相信，通过对周总理报告的讨论和学习，必将进一步调动各方面的积极性，加强全国人民的团结，有力地鼓舞全国人民完成和超额完成规模宏大的一九五九年国民经济计划。
    各位委员，无数的事实都证明，我们的国家比过去任何时期都更加兴旺和昌盛。在座的有不少委员都和我一样，已经是年逾花甲的老人。我们都在旧社会里生活过一个很长的时期，旧中国的面貌，我们是知道得比较清楚的。回顾旧中国的情况，看看现在的祖国到处呈现着的欣欣向荣的景象，再想想这种翻天复地的变化只不过经历了十年的时间，我们这些老年人的欢喜心情，真是难以用言语来形容的。过去我常常讲，共产党和毛主席的领导是正确的，是伟大和英明的，领导人民赢得了一个胜利又一个胜利，但是，我没有想到，在全民整风和反右派斗争以后不到两年的时间里，竟能取得如此的辉煌成就和重大胜利。从这里我感到，对党和毛主席领导的正确，对社会主义制度的优越性，对劳动人民获得解放后的智慧和力量，我是认识不足的，我的思想还远远落在形势发展的后面。更使我们感动的，是党和毛主席教导我们不能满足于已有的成就。党认为，比起旧社会的穷困的昨天，我国确实已经有了翻天复地的变化，但比起伟大的明天，现有的成就却又是微不足道的。为了把我国建成一个具有现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的伟大的社会主义国家，还需要我们全国人民作十分艰巨的努力。从这里我更体会到党和毛主席的伟大和正确。有这样一个伟大的党和英明的领袖的领导，我们感到骄傲，我们信心百倍，我们一定能够取得更加伟大的成就，走向美丽而繁荣幸福的共产主义社会。
    各位委员，已经和将要取得的一切伟大成就都不是偶然的。在党和毛主席领导下六亿多人民的大团结，是我国不断取得革命斗争和生产建设胜利的重要保证。正如周总理在这次报告中所指出的，我国人民大团结的基础是工人和农民的联盟。为了调动一切积极因素为社会主义建设服务，党在不断加强工农联盟的前提下，团结了一切能够团结的人，不断地巩固和发展了劳动人民同一切可以合作的非劳动人民之间的联盟，参加这次大会使我进一步体会到，通过人民公社化运动和整个社会主义事业的大跃进，我国的工农联盟已经获得了空前的巩固；通过全民整风和反右派斗争，进一步加强了人民内部的团结，使我国的人民民主统一战线在社会主义前提下有了新的巩固和发展。一九五六年，党提出了同各民主党派“长期共存，互相监督”的方针。党提出这一方针的目的，是为了进一步巩固党的领导和人民民主专政，为了团结一切能够团结的人为社会主义建设服务。一九五七年夏天，资产阶级右派歪曲了这个方针，借帮助共产党整风的机会，向党、向人民、向社会主义发动了猖狂进攻。为了维护党的领导和社会主义事业，全国人民在党的领导下击退了资产阶级右派的进攻；我们农工民主党在共产党的领导和广大人民的支持下也粉碎了以章伯钧、黄琪翔、李伯球为首的右派联盟。现在事实越来越明显，党领导全国人民对资产阶级右派进行斗争，是非常正确的。党真正做到了变坏事为好事，通过对右派分子的斗争，提高了人民的觉悟，加强了人民内部的团结，进一步巩固了人民民主专政，并为贯彻“长期共存，互相监督”的方针创造了十分有利的条件。
    组织民主党派成员通过学习、工作和劳动实践，继续进行改造
    贯彻“长期共存，互相监督”的方针，从我们民主党派来说，实质上就是按照毛主席所指示的六条政治标准，不断进行自我改造，更好地为社会主义建设服务。党始终坚持了对资产阶级知识分子进行团结、教育、改造的政策，帮助资产阶级知识分子进行自我改造，更好地为社会主义服务。为了达到这一目的，党为我们创造了一切有利的条件，并随着阶级斗争形势的变化，在帮助资产阶级知识分子进行改造时运用了不同的方法。正如李维汉副主席在这次报告中所指出的：“在反右派斗争和整风运动中，主要是采取群众大鸣、大放、大字报、大辩论的方式，严肃地进行政治思想批判；在右派的猖狂进攻被粉碎和整风运动告一段落的形势下，就采取和风细雨的方式，进行耐心说服的正面教育，适当地进行批评和自我批评，使他们的自我改造收到了显著的效果。”我认为这都是非常正确的。从李维汉副主席的这段话里我体会到：第一，资产阶级知识分子必须继续进行自我改造；第二，当前，改造过程中必须坚持正面教育，和风细雨和以理服人的方法。通过反右派斗争和整风运动，通过学习、工作和劳动锻炼，在我们民主党派成员中，的确有许多人都有了不同程度的进步，有不少人真诚地愿意接受党的领导，并在为社会主义服务方面已经做出了成绩。单就我们农工党的医药卫生方面的成员看，一年多来，他们中有不少人在贯彻党的中医政策，在西医学习中医，中西医合流，团结一致为人民健康事业服务方面，都发挥了一定的积极作用。但也不可否认，大多数的成员依然没有摆脱中间状态，按照毛主席所指示的六条政治标准来衡量，还必须经过一个较长时期的自我改造的过程。因此，帮助组织成员通过学习、工作和劳动实践，继续进行改造，是非常必要的。经验告诉我们，民主党派成员的改造，必须与服务相结合。多一分改造，就多一分服务。改造为了服务，通过服务又可以推动改造。服务和改造相结合，是一条已经经过实践证明了的正确的原则。在各级中共党组织的领导下，我们民主党派的许多基层组织在这方面已经开始作出了成绩，取得了经验。这些基层组织在中共党委的领导下，围绕所在单位的中心工作帮助成员进行自我改造，既推动了服务，又提高了政治思想觉悟，发挥了党在团结、教育、改造资产阶级知识分子方面的助手作用。从这里我们更有理由相信，只要真正接受共产党的领导，我们民主党派在推动成员为社会主义服务和帮助他们继续进行自我改造方面，是有很多工作可做的，也是一定可以作出不少成绩的。在沿着社会主义的道路上继续前进，就一定能实现共产党所提出的“长期共存，互相监督”的愿望。
    庆贺西藏人民获得新生，正告印度扩张主义分子
    周总理在报告中指出：“祖国的统一是全国各民族的最高利益”。这句话表达了我国各民族人民的共同意志和愿望。在党和毛主席的领导下，由于民族政策的正确执行，我国各民族之间的团结已经大大加强了。帝国主义始终要破坏我们这种团结，企图破坏中国的统一。原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团，勾结帝国主义、蒋介石集团和外国反动派不久之前在拉萨发动了背叛祖国、破坏统一的武装叛乱，这种严重的罪恶行为激起了各族人民的无比愤怒。为了维护国家统一和民族团结，各族人民对国务院解散原西藏地方政府的命令一致表示衷心拥护，对迅速平息拉萨叛乱的人民解放军西藏军区部队无不表示敬意。我们高兴的看到，西藏反动集团所发动的叛乱已经遭到可耻的失败，而西藏的僧俗人民却从此获得了新生，今后就有可能摆脱最落后、最黑暗、最残酷的农奴制度的枷锁，实现民主自治和社会进步的愿望了。这是我国民族团结政策的一个伟大胜利，我们热烈地欢呼这一胜利。
    为了使西藏人民迅速解除农奴制度的痛苦，我们认为西藏的落后社会制度必须进行改革。周总理在报告中指出：“关于西藏今后的社会改革，将由中央同西藏上中层爱国人士和各界人民群众进行充分的协商，以决定实行改革的时机、步骤和办法。无论如何，改革将在充分照顾西藏特点的条件下逐步进行，在改革过程中将充分尊重藏族人民的宗教信仰和风俗习惯，尊重和发扬藏族的优秀文化。”我们认为中央的考虑是非常周到和正确的，并深信一定能得到全国人民，特别是西藏僧俗人民的热烈拥护。
    西藏是中国领土不可分割的一部分；平定西藏叛乱，纯属中国内政，不容任何外国干涉。最近一个时期，帝国主义者和外国反动派利用西藏叛乱，对我国进行了恶毒的诬蔑和攻击。这在我们中国人看来，是一点也不感到奇怪的，因为，无数的历史事实告诉我们，帝国主义者和外国反动派从来就是敌视并阴谋破坏我们祖国的统一和民族团结的。使我们感到惊异和愤慨的是，西藏的一小撮反动分子，在他们发动的叛乱失败后逃到印度去，更进一步地和帝国主义、外国反动派勾结起来，企图搞所谓西藏“独立”的阴谋，在印度的提斯浦尔地方，竟由印度的外交官员散发了一个所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”，公开提出了什么西藏的“独立”。这样一个公开攻击中国政府的政治性文件竟由印度外交官员散发出来，我们不禁要问：这难道不是公开允许在印度进行反对中国的政治活动么？而在印度所进行的这种活动又难道能找得出一丝一毫合于和平共处五项原则的精神么？
    更可笑的：由于“4、18”在提斯浦尔印度外交官员散发的所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”的漏洞百出，引起了各方面的怀疑和驳斥；乃又于“4、22”在穆索里地方用达赖名义，发表所谓第二次的“达赖声明”进行狡辩，竟说什么第一次的声明是达赖授权的，并将第一次用的第三人称——他，改为第一人称——我，而印度外交官员梅农则又硬说“4、18”的声明是达赖自己写的，这真是丑态百出，欲盖弥彰了。
    由于达赖亲自承认了写给我们谭冠三将军的三封信，已给怀疑这三封信的人们打了一记响亮的耳光，但他们还要进一步诬蔑我们班禅在全国人民代表大会会议上的发言也是假的，这真是扩张主义者一向情愿的自欺欺人之谈。大家知道，达赖的出走，本来是被叛乱分子劫持的，我全国人民都希望他能早日摆脱劫持，回到西藏来，但我们友好邻邦的印度总理尼赫鲁先生还要好心肠地说什么为达赖回到本国创造条件，不是奇妙的论调吗？
    各位委员，我们的国家是一贯珍视中印两国传统的友谊的，但如果有人想利用我们珍视友谊的心情，来玩弄我们，干涉我国的内政，那是绝对不能容忍的！
    从这里又不能不使我们想到，长期以来，西藏的上层反动分子以印度的噶伦堡作为在外国进行阴谋活动的中心，印度的一些政治家和扩张主义者口口声声对叛乱分子表示“同情”，对中国政府平定西藏叛乱表示“不安”，这些都不是偶然的。对此，我们要提醒印度的某些扩张主义者注意，我国政府一贯坚持不干涉他国内政的原则，同时也决不容许任何外国干涉我国的内政。中国任人欺侮和摆布的时代早已一去不复返了，对中国的任何阴谋破坏，都是注定要失败的。
    各位委员，我们这一次的大会是象征着全国人民更加团结的大会，是跃进的大会，是迎接国庆十周年由胜利走向更大胜利的大会。生活在这样一个伟大的时代，参加这样一个重要的会议，我们感到非常光荣，更感到责任重大。让我们在中国共产党和毛泽东主席的领导下，在建设社会主义总路线的光辉照耀下，团结一致，为完成和超额完成一九五九年的国民经济计划而加倍的努力吧。
