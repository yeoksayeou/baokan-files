    US New Military Conspiracy in South Vietnam and Laos
    Commentator of this newspaper

    Following the instigation of the Lao Kingdom government to abandon the Geneva Accords, the conspiracy to seize the entire Indochina is being intensified and actively pursued. The materials published in the ninth interim report of the International Commission for Supervision and Control in Vietnam, though inevitably limited, powerfully illustrate this grave situation.

    Since the end of February this year, US imperialism has incited the Ngo Dinh Diem clique to dispatch 15,000 infantry, artillery, and paratrooper troops equipped with new weapons to launch a frenzied so-called "sweep" in the Bien Hoa area near Cambodia, massacring unarmed Vietnamese people on a large scale. This is a complete violation of Article 14(c) of the Geneva Agreement on the Cessation of Hostilities in Vietnam, which clearly stipulates that "each party undertakes to refrain from any reprisals or discrimination against individuals or organizations on account of their activities during the period of hostilities, and to guarantee their democratic freedoms." According to the International Commission's report alone, the South Vietnamese authorities have carried out more than a thousand acts of persecution against the Vietnamese people since the ceasefire. The Ngo Dinh Diem clique's brutal suppression and policy of terroristic reprisals against the broad masses of patriotic South Vietnamese people who demand democratic freedom and national reunification and oppose turning South Vietnam into a US military base and colony, demonstrate that the so-called South Vietnamese authorities are nothing more than the vicious claws of US imperialism in enslaving the Vietnamese people. This "sweep," launched to suppress the resistance of the South Vietnamese people, create favorable conditions for US military bases, and prepare conditions for joining the Southeast Asia military bloc, has been going on for more than two months and is still underway. This is the largest massacre carried out by the Ngo Dinh Diem clique under the instigation of US imperialism since the French colonialists were forced to accept the ceasefire. The Chinese people fully sympathize with the South Vietnamese people who are suffering cruel persecution by US imperialism and the Ngo Dinh Diem clique, and support their struggle against the US-Ngo clique's sabotage of the Geneva Accords and their attempts to turn South Vietnam into a US military base and colony. As one of the participating countries of the Geneva Conference, we cannot but express our strong condemnation of this bloody atrocity by the US-Ngo clique in violation of the Geneva Accords.

    In addition to suppressing the broad masses of patriotic South Vietnamese people, the "sweep" launched by the US-Ngo clique also aims to threaten the security of the Kingdom of Cambodia. As is well known, the Cambodian traitor Sam Sary has fled to South Vietnam and is organizing the so-called "Free Cambodia" in South Vietnam near Cambodia. Prince Sihanouk pointed out at a reception celebrating the graduation ceremony of a new class of graduates from the Royal School of Administration on February 25 this year: "In the Loc Ninh area (within South Vietnam, near Bien Hoa) – where several rebel commando teams are already ready, there will soon be unstable situations again." Indeed, on March 17, South Vietnam actually sent a note to Cambodia, suggesting that the two countries "launch a joint offensive" in the border area and "allow the authorities on both sides of the border to have the right to enter ten kilometers into the territory of the other party," and even threatened that "if the Cambodian government accepts these suggestions, then South Vietnam will maintain the best relations with Cambodia." This absurd "suggestion" has been solemnly rejected by the Kingdom of Cambodia.

    Facts have proved that it is US imperialism that is instigating the Ngo Dinh Diem clique to persecute the South Vietnamese people and threaten the security of Cambodia. The report of the International Commission for Supervision and Control in Vietnam pointed out that the Vietnam People's Army has repeatedly accused the United States of violating Articles 16 and 17 of the Agreement on the Cessation of Hostilities by sending additional military personnel to South Vietnam and transporting many reinforcements of weapons, and that in order to cover up its violations of the agreement, it has consistently instigated the Ngo Dinh Diem clique to obstruct the International Commission from investigating these violations. However, even under these circumstances, the Commission still discovered many US violations of the Geneva Accords. The report of the International Commission shows that, based solely on the records of the Commission's teams (which are of course extremely limited), the United States dispatched more than two thousand military personnel to South Vietnam in 1956 and 1957 alone. The International Commission decided that the "Temporary Equipment Replacement Mission," one of the US military agencies in South Vietnam, must end its work by the end of June this year and should no longer exist thereafter, and its personnel should be withdrawn from South Vietnam. However, the South Vietnamese authorities recently rejected this decision. It can be seen from this that it is US military personnel who are commanding the Ngo Dinh Diem puppet troops using American weapons, carrying out large-scale suppression against the unarmed South Vietnamese people and pointing their guns at the peace-loving Kingdom of Cambodia.

    It is worth noting that US imperialism is carrying out another conspiracy in southern Laos aimed at threatening the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the Kingdom of Cambodia. Some responsible personnel from South Vietnam, Thailand, and Laos, as well as the Cambodian traitor Sam Sary, are engaging in frequent contacts and activities there, planning for the establishment of a large US military base. In coordination with this military base, a strategic highway crossing the Indochina Peninsula is also under construction. This conspiracy is clearly an attempt to threaten the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, encircle the Kingdom of Cambodia from three sides, and turn the Kingdom of Laos into a de facto Manila military bloc country, which deserves the vigilance of all peace-loving people in Indochina and Southeast Asian countries.

    The Chinese people are paying close attention to the development of the situation. We believe that the difficulties encountered by the International Commission for Supervision and Control in Vietnam in monitoring and supervising the implementation of the Geneva Accords should be valued and resolved. The countries participating in the Geneva Conference should take effective measures to stop US imperialism from carrying out new military conspiracies in this region, maintain the Geneva Agreements on the cessation of hostilities in Indochina, and safeguard peace in the Indochina region.

    美国在南越和老挝的新军事阴谋
    本报评论员
    继策动老挝王国政府毁弃日内瓦协议以后，企图霸占整个印度支那的阴谋策划正在变本加厉、积极进行。越南国际委员会第九次临时报告所发表的材料，虽然不可免地带有局限性，但也有力地说明了这一严重情况。
    美帝国主义从今年2月底以来，就唆使吴庭艳集团出动一万五千名用新式武器配备的步兵、炮兵和伞兵部队，向接近柬埔寨的边和地区发动猖狂的所谓“扫荡”，大肆屠杀手无寸铁的越南人民。这是完全违反日内瓦会议关于在越南停止敌对行动协定第十四条丙款的规定的，那里明确规定了“各方约定，不因个人和团体在敌对行动期间的活动而对其加以任何报复和歧视，并保障其民主自由”。仅就国际委员会报告所载，南越当局曾在停战以后对越南人民进行了一千多次迫害行为。吴庭艳集团对要求民主自由和国家统一、反对变南越为美国军事基地和殖民地的南越广大爱国人民所施行的残酷镇压与恐怖报复政策，说明所谓南越当局，只不过是美帝国主义奴役越南人民的凶恶爪牙而已。他们为了压下南越人民的反抗，为美国军事基地创造顺利环境，为参加东南亚军事集团准备条件而发动的这一次“扫荡”，到现在为止已经进行了两个多月，现在还正在进行。这是自从法国殖民主义者被迫接受停战以来，吴庭艳集团在美帝国主义指使下进行的规模最大的一次屠杀。中国人民完全同情身受美帝国主义和吴庭艳集团残酷迫害的南越人民，支持他们反对美吴集团破坏日内瓦协议将南越变为美国军事基地和殖民地的斗争。作为日内瓦会议参与国之一，我们不能不对美吴集团这种违反日内瓦协议的血腥暴行表示强烈的谴责。
    美吴集团所发动的这一“扫荡”，除了目的在于镇压南越广大爱国人民外，还企图以此威胁柬埔寨王国的安全。如所周知，柬埔寨的叛国分子桑·萨里已经逃往南越，并且正在南越靠近柬埔寨的地方组织所谓“自由柬埔寨”。西哈努克亲王今年2月25日在庆祝皇家行政学校新的一期毕业生毕业典礼招待会上指出：“在禄宁（在南越境内，靠近边和）地区——那里有几支叛乱突击队已经准备就绪，最近又会出现不安定的局面。”果然，3月17日，南越竟照会柬埔寨，建议两国在边境地区“发动一次联合进攻”，并且“让边境双方当局有权进入对方境内十公里地方”，甚至威胁说：“如果柬埔寨政府接受这些建议，那末南越将同柬埔寨保持最好的关系。”这项荒谬透顶的“建议”已为柬埔寨王国严正拒绝。
    事实证明，嗾使吴庭艳集团迫害南越人民和威胁柬埔寨安全的正是美帝国主义。越南国际委员会的报告指出，越南人民军曾多次指控美国违反停止敌对行动协定第十六条和第十七条的规定，向南越增派军事人员和运进许多增援性的武器，而且为了掩盖它的违反协定的行为，一贯嗾使吴庭艳集团阻挠国际委员会对这些违反协定事件进行调查。但是，即使在这种情况下，委员会仍然发现了美国许多违反日内瓦协议的行为。国际委员会的报告说明，仅就委员会的小组记载（当然只能是极受限制的），美国在1956和1957两年中，向南越派遣了二千多名军事人员。国际委员会曾决定，美国驻南越的军事机构之一“临时装备更新团”必须于今年6月底结束它的工作，此后即不应再存在，它的人员应撤出南越。但是，最近南越当局竟拒绝了这一决定。由此可见，正是美国军事人员在指挥着那些使用美国武器的吴庭艳傀儡军队，对手无寸铁的南越人民大施镇压和把枪口对准爱好和平的柬埔寨王国。
    值得注意的是美帝国主义正在老挝南部进行旨在威胁越南民主共和国和柬埔寨王国的另一阴谋。南越、泰国、老挝的一些负责人员和柬埔寨的叛徒桑·萨里正在那里进行频繁的接触和活动，为美国在那里建立一个大军事基地进行筹划。配合这一军事基地、横贯印度支那半岛的战略公路也正在修建。这一阴谋显然是企图威胁越南民主共和国，从三面包围柬埔寨王国和将老挝王国变为事实上的马尼拉军事集团国家，这是值得所有爱好和平的印度支那人民和东南亚各国人民的警惕的。
    中国人民对于事态的发展正在加以密切的注意。我们认为，越南国际委员会所提出的关于它在监察和监督日内瓦协议的实施中所遇到的困难应该得到重视和解决。日内瓦会议与会各国应该采取有效措施以制止美帝国主义在这一地区施展新的军事阴谋，维护日内瓦会议关于印度支那的停战协议，维护印度支那地区的和平。
