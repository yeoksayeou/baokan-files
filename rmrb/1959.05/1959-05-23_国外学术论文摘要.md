    The Unity of Party Spirit and Scientific Spirit

    Why do bourgeois thinkers and revisionists repeatedly attack the principle of Party spirit and clamor that scientific objectivity and class character/Party spirit cannot coexist? This is not only because openly declaring the Party spirit of scientific theory is unacceptable to the bourgeois way of thinking, but mainly because the combination of Party spirit and scientific spirit is the source of the great transformative power of Marxist doctrine. The proletariat, by virtue of its position in society, is compelled to solve the historically mature task of transforming capitalism into socialism. It hopes to objectively and scientifically reflect reality rather than distort it. This explains why the class interests and Party interests of the proletariat require an objective and scientific attitude towards reality, and why Marxism itself combines Party spirit and scientific spirit. Lenin wrote: "This theory has an irresistible attraction for socialists in all countries because it combines strict and supreme scientific character (the summit of social science) with revolutionism... intimately and indissolubly combined in the very theory itself. In fact, it directly raises the task of theory, the aim of science is to assist the oppressed class in their actual economic struggle." This is the essence of the question of the relationship between scientific spirit and Party spirit in Marxist doctrine, and how the historical process raises and Marxist-Leninism solves this question.

    Some say that there is indeed a difference between ideology and science, because there is no difference between bourgeois physics and proletarian physics, while ideology has class character. As everyone knows, the proletarian ideology and the bourgeois ideology are opposed. This is correct, and this difference is also taken into account by Marxists. The Communist Party opposes both neglecting the achievements of foreign science when struggling against the bourgeois ideology, and understanding the slogan of seriously studying all the achievements of modern science as abandoning the struggle against the bourgeois ideology. However, revisionists metaphysically exaggerate the difference between science and ideology, thus drawing extremely erroneous conclusions.

    Material production activities—the foundation of social life—require the accumulation of knowledge about reality. Cognition, which at a certain stage takes the form of scientific theory, develops forward to meet this need. Science is a system of objective knowledge about the surrounding world. Regardless of the social system, regardless of which class is in a dominant position, society always needs objective knowledge. Therefore, even if the direction of scientific research is determined by the self-interest of the exploiting classes, the accumulated scientific knowledge still has objective cognitive value.

    The objective knowledge accumulated in various historical periods is always the property of society, and society never rejects these achievements, although reactionary classes sometimes attempt to overturn objectively correct principles that directly violate their interests and worldviews. There is no need to rediscover the various laws that have already been discovered, such as Newton's laws, Mendeleev's periodic table of elements, and Adam Smith and Ricardo's labor theory of value. Relying on past achievements, developing and deepening these achievements, human understanding can move forward and serve the needs of practice. Strict inheritance is a necessary condition for the progress of human knowledge, and it is a necessary condition for human knowledge to enter absolute truth from relative truth.

    Natural science develops under certain social conditions, so natural science is influenced by ideology and used in the struggle of ideologies. For example, Einstein's theory of relativity is certainly not an ideological concept. But who doesn't know that this theory has been used in the ideological struggle between materialism and idealism! Therefore, thoroughly implementing a materialist worldview in science is a necessary factor for the smooth development of science.

    On the other hand, natural science itself requires methodological guidance, and the ability to use concepts, which, as Engels said, can only be developed with the help of philosophical research. The need for methodological guidance opens the way for a certain worldview to penetrate into science. The influence of a certain class ideology on science is largely realized through philosophy, because philosophy is the most general theoretical expression of a certain class's intentions. The characteristics of philosophy as a social ideology also lie in the fact that it is a component of the class's ideology, the class's worldview, and also a form of understanding the world. Therefore, the relationship between science and philosophy cannot be estimated from the perspective of willingness or unwillingness. The task is to determine which philosophy can guarantee favorable prerequisites for the development of science in the current period.

    Ideology and social science have a deeper organic connection, because here, the object of reflection is society, and the laws of social development directly affect people's interests and the interests of various classes. Therefore, in a society with antagonistic classes, there is no and cannot be a supra-class social science.

    Revisionists try to separate science from Marxist ideology, insisting that Marxist ideology imposes standards that violate science on science, because Marxist ideology does not require conformity to facts, but conformity to worldview principles. This statement is inconsistent with reality. First, Marxist ideology is a scientific ideology, so it is absurd to oppose conformity to facts with conformity to the principles of Marxist ideology. The result of science "getting rid of" Marxist ideology is that science submits to bourgeois ideology. Second, theoretical conformity to facts is a basic and universally accepted requirement of any science. The question is how to make theory conform to facts in social science. Only social historical practice is the objective standard for testing whether conclusions conform to facts. For social science, in the current conditions, the practice of the proletarian struggle is such a standard. Only by scientifically analyzing all the facts related to the phenomenon to be studied can the victory of the proletarian class struggle be guaranteed.

    Regarding Obligation as a Need of Life

    Wherever there are certain relationships between people, wherever there is common life and activity, obligations arise. Obligations can arise from relationships such as comradeship, friendship, and family, and can also arise from one's relationship to the country, class, party, a certain social movement, and so on. Marxist ethics recognizes the great importance of obligations based on relationships such as friendship, comradeship, and family, and at the same time believes that these obligations cannot conflict with broader social obligations, but must be determined by them. Our party has always believed that the interests of the people's socialist country are higher than the interests of this or that individual collective and individual place; the long-term and fundamental interests of building communism are higher than the current interests and temporary interests.

    Marxist-Leninist ethics attaches importance to all attitudes of faithfully fulfilling social obligations, but especially attaches importance to such an attitude towards obligations, that is, turning the burden of obligations into a heartfelt belief, into a habit. A person who accepts his social and other obligations in this situation will not regard obligations as merely external, but as an expression of his own essence, as a need of life.

    Regarding obligation as a need of nature, regarding it as a profound belief in the historical justice of the people's cause and the cause of communism, this is the content of the communist's moral obligation. Social obligations (civic, patriotic, internationalist, etc. obligations) become the inner needs of people, and also become moral obligations.

    The stronger a person's concept of social obligation, the more the necessity of fulfilling social obligations becomes a need and habit of nature, the fewer the sources of conflict between obligation and personal wishes, hobbies, and habits. In this case, no personal hobbies will prevent a person from resolutely carrying out his obligations, no matter how strict the requirements of this obligation, no matter how contrary it is to personal wishes. This is by no means to say that obligations and people's hobbies, people's wishes, etc. cannot have common ground. On the contrary, the ardent desire to fulfill obligations is the most important prerequisite for the successful fulfillment of obligations. ("Academic Translations" Issue 5, A.

    Ownership and Distribution Systems

    Public ownership under communism is a single communist ownership. Its difference from public ownership under socialism lies in: public ownership under communism will be based on a new and higher material and technical foundation, based on a higher level of social production development, and there will be no other form of socialist ownership of the means of production coexisting with it; public ownership will occupy an absolute dominant position. The higher degree of development of public ownership is also reflected in the more extensive direct participation of the masses of the people in production management, and in their higher degree of creativity and initiative.

    Sometimes people often emphasize that the difference between communist public ownership and socialist public ownership is the difference between non-state ownership and state ownership. In exploring this issue, it must be estimated that: if the state is still needed in the future, if the state will still appear as the representative of the whole society, then, even under the communist system, public ownership may well be retained in the form of state ownership. Obviously, in this case, the nature of the state will undergo essential changes, because most of its domestic functions will belong to the nature of social organizations.

    In socialist society, the distribution of consumer goods is realized according to the principle of "from each according to his ability, to each according to his work." Under socialist conditions, the amount of material wealth and spiritual wealth is not enough to distribute according to need. Distribution according to work is the only practical and fair principle under this condition. It can ensure that people are concerned about their production results from the perspective of material interests, and can stimulate the growth of production, the improvement of production, and the improvement of workers' skill levels. Egalitarian distribution methods will damage the material incentives for improving labor productivity and improving work.

    When talking about distribution according to work under the socialist system, it should be noted that a certain share of social products (and an increasing share) is now not distributed according to the quantity and quality of the workers' labor, but is supplied free of charge. With the development of socialist society, this part of social products will increase, which is an important prerequisite for the gradual transition to the communist distribution principle.

    Marxist-Leninist classic writers pointed out that the characteristic of distribution according to work under the socialist system is the remnant of "bourgeois rights." This principle is often misunderstood as the existence of bourgeois distribution principles under socialist conditions. However, what Marx and Lenin referred to was not bourgeois distribution, because bourgeois distribution is completely determined by bourgeois ownership, and its characteristic is the existence of man exploiting man. Under the capitalist system, there is class inequality and unfairness in the distribution of material resources. Under the socialist system, there is neither bourgeois ownership nor exploitation, and all people are distributed according to their work on the basis of public ownership. The essence of socialist equality lies in this. Under the socialist system, the same right standard is still used for different people—equal pay for equal work. Therefore, there will be inevitable inequality in the share of products distributed in the socialist stage.

    In the process of communist construction, the skill level of workers will be increasingly improved, and the essential difference between mental and physical labor will be increasingly eliminated. In terms of labor remuneration, the differences between various workers will be narrowed, but this is not due to the adoption of egalitarian distribution methods, but due to the growth of wages after the cultural and technical level of workers is improved, so the wage level of low-paid workers will be improved. The inequality caused by the different number of family members and the number of people needing to be supported will also be gradually eliminated by increasing public funds. As a result, the communist characteristics of product distribution will grow more and more.

    国外学术论文摘要
    编者按：学术译丛第五期最近已经出版，下面是其中三篇论文的摘要。
    党性和科学性的统一
    为什么资产阶级思想家和修正主义者要一再攻击党性原则、叫嚣科学客观性同阶级性和党性不能并存呢？这不仅是因为公开宣布科学理论的党性是资产阶级思维方式所不能接受的，这主要是因为党性和科学性的结合是马克思主义学说的伟大改造力量的泉源。无产阶级这个阶级按它在社会上的地位来说，不得不解决历史上成熟了的任务，即改造资本主义为社会主义的任务，它是希望客观地、科学地反映现实而不是歪曲现实的。这就说明，为什么无产阶级的阶级利益、党的利益要求对现实采取客观的、科学的态度，为什么马克思主义本身把党性和科学性结合在一起。列宁写道：“这一理论对世界各国的社会主义者之所以具有不可遏止的吸引力，就在于它把严格的和高度的科学性（它是社会科学的顶峰）和革命性结合起来……把二者内在地和不可分割地结合在这个理论本身中。实际上，这里直接地提出理论的任务、科学的目的是帮助被压迫阶级去进行他们已在实际进行的经济斗争”。马克思主义学说中的科学性和党性的相互关系问题的实质，以及历史行程怎样提出和马克思列宁主义怎样解决这个问题的实质，就是这样。
    有人说，思想体系和科学的确是有区别的。因为没有资产阶级物理学和无产阶级物理学的区别，而思想体系则是具有阶级性的。大家知道，无产阶级思想体系和资产阶级思想体系是对立的。这是对的，这种区别也是马克思主义者所考虑到的。共产党既反对在同资产阶级思想体系作斗争时忽视国外科学的成就，也反对把认真研究现代科学一切成就的口号理解为放弃对资产阶级思想体系作斗争。但是修正主义者形而上学地夸大科学和思想体系的区别，因而得出极端错误的结论。
    物质生产活动——社会生活的基础——需要积累关于现实的知识。在一定阶段具有科学理论形式的认识，符合这种需要，便向前发展。科学就是关于周围世界的客观知识的体系。不管什么社会制度，不管哪个阶级占统治地位，社会总需要客观知识。因此，即使科学研究的方针是由剥削阶级的私利所决定，已经积累的科学知识还是有客观的认识价值的。
    在各个历史时期积累起来的客观知识始终是社会的财产，社会永远也不拒绝这些成就，虽然反动阶级有时也企图推翻直接违反他们的利益和世界观的客观正确原理。没有必要重新发现已经发现的各种定律，例如牛顿定律，门得列也夫的元素周期律，亚当·斯密和李嘉图的劳动价值论。依靠过去的成就，发展和加深这些成就，人类的认识就能向前发展，为实践的需要服务。严格的继承性是人类知识进步的必要条件，是人类知识由相对真理进入绝对真理的必要条件。
    自然科学是在一定的社会条件下发展的，所以自然科学要受思想体系的影响，并在思想体系的斗争中被利用。例如爱因斯坦的相对论当然不是思想体系的观念。但是谁不知道这种理论在唯物主义和唯心主义的思想体系斗争中被利用呢！因此在科学中彻底贯彻唯物主义世界观是科学顺利发展的必要因素。
    另一方面，自然科学本身需要方法论的指导，需要运用概念的本领，而这种本领，正像恩格斯所说的，只有借助于哲学的研究才能得到发展。需要方法论的指导，这为一定的世界观渗透到科学中开辟了道路。一定阶级的思想体系对科学的影响，在很大程度上是通过哲学来实现的，因为哲学是一定阶级的意向的最一般的理论表现。哲学这种社会意识形态的特点还在于：它是阶级的思想体系的组成部分，是阶级的世界观，同时也是认识世界的形式。因此不能从愿意或者不愿意的角度来估计科学和哲学的相互关系。任务是在于确定哪一种哲学在现在这个时期能够为科学的发展保证有利的前提。
  　思想体系和社会科学具有更深刻的有机联系，这是因为在这里，反映的对象是社会，而社会发展的规律又直接影响人们的利益，影响各个阶级的利益。因此，在对抗性阶级的社会里，没有而且也不可能有超阶级的社会科学。
    修正主义者力图使科学和马克思主义思想体系分离开来，硬说马克思主义思想体系把违反科学的标准强加于科学，因为马克思主义思想体系不要求符合事实，而是要求符合世界观原则。这种说法是不符合现实的。第一，马克思主义思想体系是科学的思想体系，因此把符合事实同符合马克思主义思想体系的原理对立起来是荒谬的。科学“摆脱”马克思主义思想体系的结果，就是科学服从于资产阶级思想体系。第二，理论符合事实是任何科学的基本的和公认的要求。问题在于，在社会科学中怎样使理论符合事实。只有社会历史实践才是检验结论是否符合事实的客观标准。对于社会科学来说，在现时条件下，无产阶级斗争的实践就是这样的标准。只有科学地分析有关所要研究的现象的全部事实，才能保证无产阶级的阶级斗争取得胜利。

    把义务看成生活的需要
    凡是在人与人有一定的关系的地方，在有共同的生活和活动的地方，就有义务产生。义务可以从同志、友谊、家庭等等关系中产生，也可以从自己对国家、阶级、党、一定的社会运动等等的关系中产生。马克思主义伦理学承认建立在友谊、同志、家庭等等关系上的义务非常重要，同时又认为这些义务不能同更广义的社会义务相抵触，而要为它所决定。我们党从来认为人民的社会主义国家的利益高于这个或者那个个别集体和个别地方的利益；建设共产主义的长远利益和根本利益高于目前利益和暂时利益。
    马克思列宁主义伦理学重视一切忠实履行社会义务的态度，但是特别重视这样一种对待义务的态度，就是把负担义务变成一种出自内心的信仰，变成一种习惯。一个人在这种情况下接受自己的社会义务和其他义务，就不会把义务看成一种只是外部的东西，而是看成自己的本质的表现，看成生活的需要。
    把义务看成本性的需要，看成对人民事业、共产主义事业的历史正义性的深刻信念，这就是共产主义者的道德义务的内容。社会义务（公民的、爱国主义的、国际主义的等等义务）成了人的内在需要，也就成了道德义务。
    一个人的社会义务观念越强，一个人履行社会义务的必要性越是变成本性的需要、习惯，那么，义务同个人愿望、爱好、癖性之间发生冲突的根源也越少。在这种情况下，任何个人爱好都不会妨碍一个人坚决执行自己的义务，不管这种义务的要求是怎样严格，不管它同个人的愿望是怎样背道而驰。这绝不是说，义务同人的爱好、人的愿望等等不能够有共同之处。恰恰相反，完成义务的殷切愿望是顺利完成义务的最重要的前提。（“学术译丛”第五期阿·施士金：“共产主义建设和马克思主义伦理学的几个问题”）

    所有制和分配制度
    共产主义条件下的全民所有制是单一的共产主义所有制。它同社会主义条件下全民所有制的区别在于：共产主义条件下的全民所有制将是建立在新质的更高的物质技术基础上，建立在更高的社会生产发展水平上，同时也不会有生产资料社会主义所有制的另一种形式和它并存；全民所有制将占绝对统治地位。全民所有制的较高发展程度也表现在人民群众更广泛地直接参加生产管理，表现在他们有更高度的创造性和积极性。
    有时人们往往强调共产主义全民所有制和社会主义全民所有制之间的差别就是非国家所有制和国家所有制之间的差别。在探讨这一问题时必须估计这一点：如果将来还需要有国家，如果国家还会作为整个社会的代表者出现，那么，即使在共产主义制度下，全民所有制也完全可能以国家所有制形式保留下来。显然，在这种情况下，国家的性质将发生本质的变化，因为它的大部分国内职能将属于社会组织的性质。
    在社会主义社会，消费品的分配是按“各尽所能，按劳分配”的原则实现的。在社会主义条件下，物质财富和精神财富的数量还不足以按需要进行分配。按劳分配是这种条件下唯一实际而公平的原则。它能保证人们从物质利益上关心他们的生产成果，能够刺激生产的增长，生产的完善以及工作者熟练程度的提高。平均主义的分配办法却会破坏对提高劳动生产率和改进工作的物质刺激。
    谈到关于社会主义制度下的按劳分配时，应该注意到，社会产品的一定份额（而且是日益增长的份额）现在已经不是按照劳动者劳动的数量和质量进行分配，而是免费供应。随着社会主义社会的发展，这部分社会产品将会增加，这是逐渐过渡到共产主义分配原则的重要前提。
    马克思列宁主义经典著作家指出，社会主义制度下按劳分配的特点是“资产阶级式的权利”的残余。这个原理往往被误解为社会主义条件下存在着资产阶级分配原则。然而马克思和列宁所指的并不是资产阶级的分配，因为资产阶级的分配完全决定于资产阶级的所有制，它的特征是存在着人剥削人的现象。在资本主义制度下，存在着阶级的不平等，以及分配物质资料方面的不公平现象。在社会主义制度下，既不存在着资产阶级所有制，也不存在着剥削，所有的人都是在公有制基础上按劳分配。社会主义平等的实质正在于此。在社会主义制度下，对不同的人还使用同一的权利尺度——同工同酬。因此就会产生社会主义阶段不可避免的分配产品时所得份额的不平等现象。
    在共产主义建设过程中，工作者的熟练程度将日益提高，脑力劳动和体力劳动之间的本质差别将日益消除。在劳动报酬方面，各个工作者之间的差别将会缩小，但这不是由于采取平均主义的分配办法，而是由于工作者文化技术水平提高以后工资的增长，因此低薪工作者的工资水平将会提高。由于家庭人数和需要赡养的人数不同而造成的不平等现象也将会通过增加公共基金的办法逐渐加以消除。从而产品分配方面的共产主义特征就会愈来愈增长。
