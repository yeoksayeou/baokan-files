Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 22nd. The first National Third Category Materials Exchange Conference, jointly convened by the Ministry of Commerce and the Ministry of Light Industry in Shanghai, concluded on the 19th after lasting two weeks.

The thirty delegations from provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions across the country participating in this conference, through frequent exchange activities, signed 21,198 spot and futures purchase and sales contracts and 1,384 futures purchase and sales agreements, with a total value of nearly 1 billion yuan in goods traded.

The conference was conducted under the guidance of the idea of "the whole country as a single chessboard." The meeting first focused on theoretical understanding, introducing the experiences of fourteen regions in holding successful materials exchange conferences by putting politics in command; and discussed issues such as the necessity of local subordination to the whole and mutual support between departments and regions. Representatives from various regions thus promoted the spirit of communist cooperation. Some supplying regions took the initiative to provide goods to demanding units; representatives from some regions, seeing that other regions also needed the materials they wanted, automatically reduced their demand plans. In the conference trading hall, big-character posters appeared every day, praising this valuable style of taking the overall situation into account and helping each other. The exchange of major commodities at the conference was carried out with delegations signing contracts and agreements; for general commodities, contracts and agreements were signed separately by relevant parties under the unified leadership of the conference. All contracts and agreements were finally reviewed and balanced by the conference. Due to this approach, the conference completed the exchange and distribution of tens of thousands of commodities in just ten days, ensuring appropriate arrangements for supply, production, and sales.

At the exchange conference, representatives from urban and rural areas made every effort to explore resources and support each other. For example, various places supplied Shanghai's light industry, chemical industry, and electromechanical industry with more than 500,000 tons of ore, equivalent to one-third of the annual needs of these industries in Shanghai; the daily necessities such as straw hats, sunflower fans, brooms, bamboo baskets, and bamboo chopsticks needed by residents of the three major cities of Beijing, Shanghai, and Tianjin were adequately met. On the other hand, Shanghai, Tianjin, and other large cities had originally planned to supply handcart axle blocks, sewing machine parts, etc., but due to increased rural demand, the supply volume was repeatedly increased. Through exchange activities, both supply and demand sides also restored many reasonable supply and sales relationships that had once been disconnected and established new cooperative relationships, making cooperation between urban and rural areas, regions, industry and commerce, and within commerce itself closer.

This conference further communicated the production and sales situation of the third category commodities, so that production can better meet the needs of the state and the market. Jilin's rural production of domestic animal placenta, etc., was previously unknown for its use; at this conference, local representatives discovered that Shanghai's pharmaceutical industry was in great need, and decided to help people's communes organize production and expand sources of supply. Each contract signed at the conference specifically stipulated the variety, quantity, specifications and quality of the commodities, laying the foundation for provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions to convene materials exchange conferences at each level in the future and organize production in a planned manner.

At this conference, more than eighty technical cooperation agreements were signed between regions according to products. The aspects of cooperation included imparting production and processing technology, processing on behalf, providing tools and equipment; the methods included inviting people to teach, sending people to learn, exchanging information, and running training classes, etc. At the conference, various places originally proposed to have 70 million straw bags, but the source of goods was only 450,000. Representatives from the straw bag producing areas of Shanghai, Jiangsu, Jilin, Hebei, Liaoning, Heilongjiang, etc. signed technical cooperation agreements with representatives from the twelve demanding areas of Guizhou, Sichuan, Guangxi, Hunan, etc., which produce rice straw, and sent people with tools to the demanding areas to teach the technology of weaving straw bags. In this way, except for individual areas that do not produce or produce little rice straw, they no longer ask for straw bags from outside. In the past, the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region discarded cattle and sheep blood, while Tianjin and Zhejiang urgently needed cattle and sheep blood powder in industry and fishery. This time, they signed a technical cooperation agreement, with Zhejiang and Tianjin sending people to help Xinjiang process cattle and sheep blood powder.

At the closing conference, Minister of Commerce Cheng Zihua summarized the achievements of this conference. He said that although it was the first time to hold a national third category materials exchange conference, it has shown its important role in the entire national economic construction and people's lives.

He called on representatives from all regions to go back, and according to the requirements of this conference, hold materials exchange conferences at all levels, and deploy the production and purchase tasks arranged at the conference level by level, all the way down to the people's communes, production teams, and factories, so that they can be implemented. At the same time, it is necessary to resolutely implement contracts and agreements, be conscientious and responsible, abide by credit, and take all measures to guarantee the completion of the obligations stipulated in the contracts and agreements. In addition, the two parties to the contract should maintain close contact and continue to carry out technical cooperation to promote the development of the production of the third category commodities.

  　沟通情况　交流经验　统筹安排　签订合同
    为第三类商品开辟繁荣道路
  　程子华在第三类物资交流会总结中要求把任务布置下去层层落实
    新华社上海22日电　商业部和轻工业部在上海联合召开的全国第一次第三类物资交流大会，历时两周，已在19日闭幕。
    参加这次大会的全国各省、市、自治区的三十个代表团，通过频繁的交流活动，在会上签订了二万一千一百九十八份现货、期货购销合同和一千三百八十四份期货购销协议，成交的商品总值近十亿元。
    大会是在“全国一盘棋”的思想指导下进行的。会议首先务虚，介绍了十四个地区以政治挂帅，开好物资交流会的经验；对局部必须服从整体、部门地区之间必须相互支援等问题进行了讨论，各地代表从而发扬了共产主义协作精神。有些供货地区主动给要货单位提供货物；有些地区的代表看到自己要的物资别的地区也需要，就自动削减要货计划。大会交易馆里，每天都出现大字报，表扬这种顾全大局、互相帮助的可贵风格。大会对主要商品的交流，以代表团为单位签订合同协议；对一般商品，在大会统一领导下，由有关方面分头签订合同协议。合同、协议最后都由大会统一审查，平衡调整。由于采取这种方法，大会在短短十天里，就完成了上万种商品的交流与分配工作，使供、产、销三方面都得到了适当的安排。
    在交流大会上，城市和农村的代表尽力发掘资源，相互支援。如各地供应上海轻工业、化学工业、机电工业等的矿石就有五十多万吨，相当于上海这几个行业全年需要量的三分之一；北京、上海、天津三大城市居民需要的草帽、葵扇、扫帚、竹篮、竹筷等生活用品，都得到了适当的满足。另一方面，上海、天津等大城市原来准备供应的手推车轴挡、缝纫机零件等，由于农村需要增长，也一再增加供应量。通过交流活动，供需双方还恢复了许多一度脱节的合理供销关系，建立起新的协作关系，使得城乡、地区、工商以及商业内部的协作更加密切了。
    这次会议进一步沟通了第三类商品的产销情况，使生产更能符合国家和市场的需要。吉林农村出产的家畜胎盘等，过去不知道用途；在这次会上，当地代表发现上海制药工业非常需要，决定帮助人民公社组织生产，扩大货源。会上签订的每一份合同都具体规定了商品的品种、数量、规格和质量，给各省、市、自治区今后逐级召开物资交流会，有计划地组织生产，奠定了基础。
    在这次大会上，各地区间按产品签订了八十多份技术协作协议。协作的方面包括传授生产和加工技术，代为加工，提供工具、器材；方式有请人来教、派人去学、交换资料、开办训练班等等。会上，各地原来提出要草袋七千万条，可是货源只有四十五万条；上海、江苏、吉林、河北、辽宁、黑龙江等草袋产区的代表就与产稻草的贵州、四川、广西、湖南等十二个要货地区的代表，分别签订了技术协作协议，派人带工具到要货地区去传授编织草袋的技术。这样，除了个别不产或少产稻草的地区以外，都不再向外要草袋了。新疆维吾尔自治区过去都把牛羊血丢掉，而天津、浙江在工业、渔业上又亟需牛羊血粉。这次，他们签订了技术协作协议，由浙江、天津派人帮助新疆加工牛羊血粉。
    在闭幕大会上，商业部部长程子华总结了这次大会的成就。他说，召开全国性的第三类物资交流大会，虽然还是第一次，但是已显示出它在整个国家经济建设和人民生活中的重要作用。
    他号召各地代表回去后，要根据这次大会的要求，逐级开好物资交流会，把大会上安排的生产、收购任务层层布置下去，一直到人民公社、生产队、工厂，使之落实。同时要坚决执行合同、协议，认真负责，遵守信用，对合同、协议所规定的义务，应该采取一切措施，千方百计保证完成。此外，签约双方还应该保持密切联系，继续开展技术协作，以促进第三类商品生产的发展。（附图片）
