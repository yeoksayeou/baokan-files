　　Speech by Committee Member Jiang Bingling

Mr. Chairman, fellow committee members:
    I fully endorse Premier Zhou Enlai's "Government Work Report," as well as the reports by Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and Vice Chairman Li Weihan of the National Committee of the CPPCC. I am determined to strive to implement the guidelines and tasks proposed in these reports.

    Upon hearing about our country's grand plan for developing the national economy in 1959, and witnessing the great achievements in all aspects during the First Five-Year Plan period, especially the brilliant successes of the all-round Great Leap Forward on all fronts in 1958, I felt extremely joyful and encouraged. I wholeheartedly realized that the future of our motherland is full of promise, the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao is wise and correct, the socialist system is incomparably superior, and life in the new society is infinitely beautiful and happy. I fully believe that under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and with the united efforts of the people of the whole country, we will surely be able to achieve a greater and more comprehensive leap forward in 1959, and fulfill and overfulfill the 1959 plan for developing the national economy.

    Recently, the former Tibetan local government and the Tibetan upper-class reactionary clique, instigated and supported by imperialism and foreign reactionaries, launched a counter-revolutionary rebellion to undermine the unification of the motherland and national unity. The Central People's Government has taken wise and resolute measures to swiftly quell the rebellion. This not only strengthened the cause of national unification and national unity, accelerated the social reform of Tibet, but also further consolidated our country's security and defended the peace of Asia. This is a great victory for the people of all ethnic groups in our country, a fatal blow to the Tibetan traitorous clique, and also a heavy blow to imperialism and foreign expansionists. I express my warm support for the government's wise measures and extend my highest respect to the People's Liberation Army for quelling the rebellion in Tibet.

    At present, a small group of Tibetan traitors who fled to India are further colluding with imperialism and foreign reactionaries, continuing to kidnap the Dalai Lama, and issued a loophole-ridden, fact-twisting so-called "Statement by the Dalai Lama" on April 18, which was disseminated by Indian foreign officials. At the same time, in India, there have been slanders against our country, support, sympathy, and encouragement for the Tibetan rebel group. Some leaders of the ruling party and official figures, such as Mrs. Indira Gandhi, the President of the Indian National Congress Party, openly described our Tibet as a "country"; Mrs. Kripalani, the General Secretary of the Congress Party, described the Tibetan rebellion as a "just cause," and organized a so-called "National Committee to Help Tibetan Refugees." Even with the connivance of the Indian police authorities, a serious incident occurred in Bombay where members of the Indian People's Socialist Party wantonly insulted Chairman Mao's portrait in front of our consulate. I express my boundless indignation and firm opposition to India's unreasonable behavior of threatening and undermining the "Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence," interfering in our country's internal affairs, and being hostile to the people of our country.

    Tibet has been an inseparable part of China's territory since ancient times. This ironclad fact cannot be denied by anyone. The "Tibetan independence" clamored by imperialism is no longer a foreign term to our people. In the past, when British imperialism ruled India, it tried every possible means to instigate the upper-class reactionary clique in Tibet to create so-called "Tibetan independence," with the aim of attempting to invade and enslave Tibet and separate Tibet from the big family of the motherland. Japanese imperialism also created the so-called "Manchukuo" and supported the puppet Pu Yi, using the same aim to carry out bloody rule over our Northeast. The Chinese people still painfully remember this wound. Now, the interventionist elements in India are also clamoring for so-called "Tibetan independence," even calling Tibet a "country," and even describing the Tibetan rebellion as a "just cause," which is exposing that they have inherited the mantle of British imperialism's aggression, and fantasizing about using Tibet as their "protectorate" and "colony." Their sinister conspiracy cannot hide the eyes and ears of the people of the world. Honest people in India pointed out that those who clamor for "Tibetan independence" are the greatest enemies of India. We absolutely cannot tolerate the actions of these Indian interventionist elements who are hostile to our country and interfere in our internal affairs. We want to warn them not to try to stir up trouble and fish in troubled waters on the Tibet issue. Today's China is no longer the China of the Qing Dynasty, the Northern Warlords, and the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang. The era of any interference and bullying of China is gone forever. If they still do not wake up quickly, value the "Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence," and cherish the friendship between the Chinese and Indian people, they will inevitably be bruised and battered and end up in utter defeat.

    I am one of those who participated in the Xinhai Revolution and subsequent democratic revolutions. In the old China, I personally witnessed the pain caused by the poverty and national division caused by the collusion between imperialism and domestic reactionaries. Today, under the wise leadership of the Communist Party, our country has driven away imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries, and established a socialist family of equality and happiness for all ethnic groups. This is the beautiful scene we have dreamed of. We will never allow anyone to split the unity of the motherland and undermine the unity of the nation. China's history over the past century has given us many useful lessons. We know who our relatives are, who our friends are, who our enemies are, who gives us happiness, and who gives us disaster. All the conspiracies and tricks of imperialism and foreign reactionaries cannot deceive the Chinese people, and they are bound to be met with shameful failure. The broad masses of the people in Tibet will surely be able to remove obstacles and, together with the people of the whole country, move towards a happy and bright socialist society.

    Finally, let me shout:
    Long live the unification of the motherland and the unity of all ethnic groups!
    Long live the Chinese Communist Party!
    Long live Chairman Mao!

### 西藏定能走上幸福光明的大道  江炳灵委员的发言

专栏：

　　西藏定能走上幸福光明的大道
    江炳灵委员的发言主席、各位委员：
    我完全拥护周恩来总理的“政府工作报告”，李富春副总理、李先念副总理、彭真副委员长和政协全国委员会李维汉副主席的报告。并坚决为贯彻执行这些报告中所提出的方针和任务而努力。
    当我听到了我们国家一九五九年发展国民经济的宏伟计划，看到了祖国第一个五年计划时期的各方面伟大成就，特别是一九五八年各个战线全面大跃进的辉煌成绩，使我感到万分欢欣和鼓舞。我衷心体会到：祖国的前途是光芒万丈，共产党和毛主席的领导是英明正确，社会主义制度是无比优越，生活在新社会是无限美好幸福。我完全相信在中国共产党领导下，全国人民的团结努力下，一定能够实现一九五九年更大更全面的跃进，完成和超额完成一九五九年发展国民经济的计划。
    最近原西藏地方政府和西藏上层反动集团在帝国主义和外国反动派的唆使支持下，发动了破坏祖反革命叛乱。中央人民政国统一和民族团结的府对此采取了英明坚决的措施，迅速敉平了叛乱，这不仅加强了国家统一和民族团结的事业，加速了西藏的社会改革；而且进一步巩固了我国的安全，保卫了亚洲的和平。这是我国各族人民的伟大胜利，是对西藏叛国集团一个致命的打击，也是对帝国主义和外国扩张主义者一个沉重的打击，我对政府的这种英明措施表示热烈的拥护，对在西藏平定叛乱的人民解放军致以崇高的敬意。
    目前逃到印度的一小撮西藏叛国分子正在与帝国主义和外国反动派进一步勾结起来，继续劫持达赖喇嘛，在四月十八日发表了一篇漏洞百出、颠倒黑白的所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”，并由印度外交官员进行散发。同时，在印度，竟出现了对我国的诬蔑，对西藏叛乱集团的支持、同情和鼓励，某些执政党和官方一些领袖人物如印度国大党主席英迪拉·甘地夫人公然把我国的西藏说成“国家”；国大党总书记克里帕拉尼夫人把西藏叛乱说成是“正义事业”，组织所谓“帮助西藏难民的全国委员会”。甚至在印度警察当局的纵容下，发生了印度人民社会党党徒在孟买我领事馆前猖狂污辱毛主席像的严重事件。我对印度这种威胁与破坏“和平共处五项原则”，干涉我国内政，敌视我国人民的无理行为，表示无比的愤慨和坚决反对。
    西藏自古是中国领土不可分割的一部分，这一铁的事实，是任何人所不能否认的。帝国主义所叫嚣的“西藏独立”在我国人民中已不是陌生的字眼。过去英帝国主义在统治印度时就曾千方百计挑拨西藏上层反动集团制造所谓“西藏独立”，其目的就是企图侵占奴役西藏，使西藏从祖国大家庭中分裂出去。日本帝国主义也曾经制造所谓“满洲国”，扶植傀儡溥仪，以同样目的借此对我东北进行血腥统治。中国人民对此创伤犹痛记忆犹新。现在印度的干涉主义分子也在高嚷所谓“西藏独立”，竟把西藏称为“国家”，甚至把西藏叛乱说成“正义事业”，正暴露了他们是继承了英帝国主义的侵略衣钵，幻想把西藏作为他们的“保护国”“殖民地”。他们这种罪恶阴谋是无法掩盖世界人民的耳目的。印度的正直人士就指出叫嚷“西藏独立”的人正是印度的最大敌人。印度干涉主义分子的这种敌视我国、干涉我国内政的行动是我们所绝对不能容忍的，我们要警告他们，休想在西藏问题上兴风作浪，混水摸鱼，今天的中国已不是清朝、北洋军阀和国民党反动统治的中国，任何干涉和欺侮中国的时代已一去不复返了，如仍不及速清醒，以“和平共处五项原则”为重，以中印人民友谊为贵，是必然会碰得头青脸肿，一败涂地。
    我是参加辛亥革命和其后历次民主革命者之一，在旧中国亲眼看到帝国主义和国内反动派相互勾结所造成国家贫弱民族分裂的痛苦。今天我国在共产党的英明领导下，赶走了帝国主义和国民党反动派，建立了各民族平等幸福的社会主义大家庭，这是我们梦寐所求的美景。我们决不允许任何人分裂祖国的统一，破坏民族的团结。中国百年来的历史已给我们不少有益的教训，我们认识谁是亲人，谁是朋友，谁是敌人、懂得谁给我们幸福，谁给我们灾难，帝国主义和国外反动派的一切阴谋诡计是欺骗不了中国人民的，而且是必然会遭到可耻的失败。西藏广大的人民也一定能扫除障碍和全国人民一道，走向幸福光明的社会主义社会。
    最后让我高呼：
    祖国统一和各民族团结万岁！
    中国共产党万岁！
    毛主席万岁！
