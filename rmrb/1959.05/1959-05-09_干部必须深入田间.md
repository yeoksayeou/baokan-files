Cadres Must Go Deep into the Fields

　　In order to realize this year's leap forward plan, it is also necessary to continue to mobilize the masses and launch a mass movement for large-area high yields. Commune cadres and county cadres must go deep into the fields, become one with the commune members, and fight for a great harvest this summer and autumn, for the realization of the Ten Initiatives proposed by the National Conference of Advanced Units in Agricultural Socialist Construction in January this year, and for the completion and overfulfillment of this year's grain, cotton, oil crops, hemp crops, sugar crops, various non-staple foods, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries production plans.

Guangdong Province

　　This newspaper reports that cadres at all levels in various parts of Guangdong have gone deep into the teams, groups, and fields. By participating in labor, they have more closely connected with the masses, greatly encouraged the production enthusiasm of the masses, and promptly solved problems in production. During the early rice transplanting period in the Shaoguan area this year, a total of 45,000 cadres, from the prefectural committee members to production team leaders, went deep into the fields and lived, ate, and worked with the masses. In the process of participating in transplanting, they cultivated and discovered typical figures and units that created high records in transplanting, established banners, and drove the overall labor competition movement forward, increasing the transplanting progress in the entire area from 110,000 mu per day to 240,000 mu. According to statistics from Dongguan, Huiyang, Zhongshan, Hua County, Baoan and other counties in the Foshan area, more than 25,000 cadres and 290,000 commune members camped out in the fields during the transplanting upsurge and fought together. Li Peisheng, secretary of the Luocun Commune Party Committee in Nanhai County, worked with the commune members in the Lianhe Brigade, transplanting 0.66 mu himself in one day. As a result, this brigade broke through its original labor quota, increasing from 55 mu to more than 170 mu per day. Because most areas achieved concentrated leadership, united masses, and cadres in the fields, the entire province advanced at a rate of about 1 million mu per day during the busy transplanting period.

　　The vast number of cadres took the lead in hard work, participated in production and led production, and widely and enthusiastically organized cooperation and high-efficiency competition between communes, teams, groups, and individuals. As a result, labor efficiency has improved rapidly, and transplanting experts have emerged in large numbers. According to incomplete statistics from ten counties including Guangsi, Luoding, Xinxing, Taishan, Kaiping, Xingning, Meixian, Wuhua, Zijin, and Haifeng, more than 2,000 people can transplant more than one mu per day while ensuring dense planting standards.

　　Cadres participate in production labor and often consult with the masses, making production measures more practical and reasonable. This year, when determining the specifications for dense planting of early rice in various regions, they boldly mobilized the masses to discuss, listened to the correct opinions and experiences of the masses, and the cadres and the masses discussed, decided, implemented, and took responsibility together. In this way, they not only criticized the argument for sparse planting, but also corrected the one-sided view that "the denser the better," making rational close planting a conscious demand of the masses. Now, the vast number of cadres and the masses are turning their efforts to field management centered on accumulating fertilizer and topdressing in one go.　　(Li Zuoji)

Hunan Xiangtan

　　This newspaper reports that from the first secretary of the Xiangtan Prefectural Committee to the general branch secretaries of the commune production brigades in Hunan, all have gone deep into the work groups to participate in production and lead production.

　　After Yan Mingrun, the first secretary of the You County Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, went deep into the Jiubujiang Commune, he discovered that Chen Binxiu, the leader of the Huamulan Group of the Wushi Brigade of this commune, was particularly fast in transplanting rice seedlings, so he helped Chen Binxiu summarize a complete set of advanced transplanting operation methods. He also helped the commune Party committee hold an on-site transplanting meeting and invited Chen Binxiu to perform transplanting. After the commune promoted Chen Binxiu's experience, work efficiency was improved. The county party committee also printed and distributed Chen Binxiu's experience to various production teams and work groups, and launched a high-efficiency movement of "learning from Chen Binxiu and catching up with Chen Binxiu" throughout the county.

　　When Comrade Zhao Fengxiang, the first secretary of the Chaling County Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, was transplanting rice seedlings, he went to the second team of the Liujiafang Production Team of the Mijiang Commune to work as a commune member. During the labor, he found that although the 30 mu of economic crops in this team had been sown in a timely manner before transplanting, the sowing quality was poor, there were serious seedling shortages, and there were also insect pests. He carefully inspected four points of cotton fields, and found that the seedling shortage rate reached 10%, and these fields were unattended due to the urgency of transplanting. He immediately consulted with the team leader and decided to assign commune members specifically to control insects and replenish seedlings in the economic crop fields. Based on the situation of this team, he also wrote a letter to the county party committee and the commune party committee, asking them to pay attention to the overall arrangement of labor during busy periods, and each commune immediately made reasonable adjustments to labor.

Jiangxi Linchuan

　　This newspaper reports that all the cadres of Hunan Commune in Linchuan County, Jiangxi Province, went deep into the fields, labored and consulted with commune members, and many new problems in production were discovered in a timely manner, so they could also be solved in a timely manner.

　　As soon as the spring plowing began, cadres at all levels in Hunan Commune went to the fields. Wu Zaizhang, the first secretary of the commune party committee, discovered that some commune members of the Hunan Production Team prepared the fields very roughly while working with the commune members, so he immediately consulted with the commune members on how to improve the quality of field preparation. Everyone proposed three methods: first, experienced commune members should control the plows and harrows; second, designated personnel should inspect the quality of each plot; and third, the plowing and harrowing efforts should be generally increased once. After these methods were implemented, the quality of field preparation reached the standards set by the commune. Then, he convened a meeting of all the production team branch secretaries in the commune to introduce the land preparation experience of the Hunan team. As a result, the quality of land preparation throughout the commune was generally improved.

　　Handing over production plans, tasks, and measures to the masses for discussion is an important part of the Hunan Commune cadres' reliance on the masses to do things. In order to complete this year's field preparation and transplanting tasks, the commune, brigade, and team have held various debates since the spring plowing. The masses have put forward thousands of opinions and methods at the meeting, which have solved many difficult problems. For example, the commune required the Shanghudong Production Team to complete the transplanting task of 300 mu of the entire team before April 21, but this team lacked labor and needed to postpone it by two days to complete it. Production team leader Yang Shousheng handed over this task to the commune members for discussion. The commune members put forward several methods: take ten transplanting experts as banners to set off a high-efficiency movement; send breakfast and lunch to the fields to save the time for commune members to go home to eat; implement a quota responsibility system. As a result, the entire team completed the transplanting task three days ahead of schedule.

　　Because the cadres consult with the masses when encountering problems, it has greatly encouraged the production enthusiasm of the commune members, and the work has also been done well. Many commune members have proactively offered suggestions to improve the work.

　　干部必须深入田间
    为了实现今年的跃进计划，还必须继续动员群众，开展大面积丰产的群众运动。公社的干部和县的干部必须深入田间，同社员打成一片，为今年夏季和秋季的大丰收而斗争，为实现今年一月全国农业社会主义建设先进单位代表会议所提出的十大倡议而斗争，为完成和超额完成今年的粮食、棉花、油料作物、麻类作物、糖料作物、各类副食品和林业、牧业、副业、渔业等项生产计划而斗争。
                   ——摘自周总理在第二届全国人民代表大会第一次会议上所作“政府工作报告”
　　广东各地
    本报讯  广东各地各级干部深入到队、到组、到田，在参加劳动中更密切地联系群众，大大鼓舞了群众的生产积极性，并且及时地解决了生产中的问题。韶关专区今年早稻插秧期间，从地委委员到生产队长以上的干部共有四万五千多人深入田头，和群众同吃、同住、同劳动。他们在参加插秧过程中，培养和发现创造插秧高纪录的典型人物和单位，树立旗帜，带动全面的劳动竞赛运动向前发展，使全区插秧进度由日插十一万亩跃进到二十四万亩。佛山专区据东莞、惠阳、中山、花县、宝安等县统计，在插秧高潮中有二万五千多个干部和二十九万社员一起扎寨田头，共同奋战。南海县罗村公社党委书记李沛生在联和大队同社员一起劳动，他自己一天插了六分六厘；结果这个大队突破了原来的劳动定额，由日插五十五亩增到一百七十多亩。由于大部分地区做到领导集中，群众齐心，干部到田，全民奋战，全省在插秧大忙期间，一直以日插一百万亩左右的速度前进。
    广大干部带头苦战，参加生产领导生产，广泛而又热烈地组织了社与社、队与队、组与组、人与人之间的协作支援和高工效竞赛。因此，劳动效率突飞猛进，插秧能手成批涌现。据广四、罗定、新兴、台山、开平、兴宁、梅县、五华、紫金、海丰等十个县不完全的统计，每日插秧超过一亩又能保证密植规格的就有两千多人。
    干部参加生产劳动，经常同群众商量，使增产措施更加切实、合理。今年各地在确定早稻密植的规格时，都放手发动群众讨论，听取群众的正确意见和经验，干部和群众共同讨论，共同决定，共同执行，共同负责。这样，既批判了主张疏植的论调，又纠正了“越密越好”的片面观点，使合理密植成为群众的自觉要求。现在，广大干部和群众又一鼓作气地转向以积肥追肥为中心的田间管理。　　（黎作骥）
　　湖南湘潭
    本报讯  湖南湘潭专区从地委第一书记到公社生产大队的总支书记，都深入作业组参加生产领导生产。
    中共攸县县委第一书记阎明润深入到酒埠江公社以后，发现这个公社五市大队花木兰小组组长陈彬秀插秧速度特别快，他就帮助陈彬秀总结出一套完整的先进插秧操作方法。他还帮助公社党委召开了一个插秧现场会，请陈彬秀进行插秧表演。这个公社推广陈彬秀的经验后，工效都提高了。县委还把陈彬秀的经验印发给各生产队、作业组，在全县范围内开展了“学习陈彬秀，赶上陈彬秀”的高工效运动。
    中共茶陵县委第一书记赵凤祥同志在插秧的时候，下到洣江公社刘家坊生产队第二小队当社员。在劳动中，他发现这个队的三十亩经济作物田，虽然在插秧以前适时播下了种，但播种质量不好，缺蔸很严重，还发生了虫害。他仔细检查了四分棉田，缺蔸达10％，而这些田因为插秧紧张无人管理。他立即同队长商量，决定抽出社员专门负责在经济作物地治虫、补蔸。根据这个队的情况，他还向县委和公社党委写了一封信，请他们注意在大忙中也要全面安排劳力，各社立即把劳力作了合理调整。

　　江西临川
    本报讯  江西临川县湖南公社全体干部深入田间，和社员同劳动同商量，许多生产中的新问题及时发现了，因此也能及时解决。
    春耕一开始，湖南公社各级干部就都下到了田间。公社党委第一书记吴载璋在湖南生产队和社员一同劳动中，发现这个队部分社员整的田很粗糙，他便立即和社员商量如何提高整田质量，大家提出了三条办法：一是由有经验的社员掌握犁耙；二是有指定专人逐丘检查质量；三是普遍增加一次犁耙功夫。这些办法实行后，整田质量都达到了公社规定的标准。接着，他就召开了全公社生产队支部书记会议，介绍了湖南队的整地经验。结果，使全社的整田质量普遍提高。
    把生产计划、任务、措施交给群众讨论，是湖南公社干部依靠群众办事的重要内容。为了完成今年的整田、插秧任务，自春耕以来，公社、大队、小队召开了各种辩论会，群众在会上提出了几千条意见和办法，使许多困难问题得到解决。例如公社要求上湖东生产队必须在4月21日前完成全队三百亩插秧任务，可是这个队劳力不足，需要延期两天，才能完成。生产队长杨寿生把这一任务交给社员讨论。社员们提出了几个办法：以十个插秧能手为旗帜，掀起高工效运动；早、中饭送到田里吃，节省社员回家吃饭的时间；实行定额责任制。结果全队提前三天完成插秧任务。
    由于干部遇事同群众商量，大大鼓舞了社员们的生产积极性，同时工作也做好了。许多社员主动提出建议改进工作。
