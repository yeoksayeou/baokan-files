Xinhua News Agency, 6th – The Algerian Military Delegation, headed by Commander Omar Oussedik, left Beijing by plane this morning to return home after their visit to China.

　　Early in the morning, the national flags of China and Algeria fluttered in the wind at the Capital Airport. Those seeing them off and the distinguished guests embraced and shook hands warmly, with a feeling of reluctance to part.

　　After the band played the national anthems of China and Algeria, Commander Omar Oussedik, accompanied by Vice Premier of the State Council and Minister of Foreign Affairs Marshal Chen Yi, reviewed the guard of honor.

　　In his farewell speech, Marshal Chen Yi said, "You are about to leave our country and return to your glorious fighting posts. However, our separation is only formal; the common struggle will forever link us together. I once again thank you for bringing the precious friendship of the Algerian people and the National Liberation Army. At the same time, please convey to the people and army of your country the deep sympathy and concern of the broad masses of the Chinese people and all the officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army for the Algerian national liberation struggle. The Chinese people will always be the reliable friends of the Algerian people. We will, as always, pay close attention to your struggle and await more news of your victories."

　　In his farewell speech, Commander Omar Oussedik first thanked the people and army of China for the warm and cordial welcome and reception they had extended to the Algerian Military Delegation as brothers. He said, "Our mission to China has been completed. We are returning to our motherland with richer experience. Now our determination to strike at French colonialism is even greater. We must rely on our own efforts and our own strength to strive for a decisive victory." He concluded by saying, "We must continue to fight for a long time and be prepared to endure all hardships and sacrifices, climbing step by step to the peak of final victory."
