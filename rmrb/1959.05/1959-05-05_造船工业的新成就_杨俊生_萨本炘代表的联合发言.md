We have listened to Premier Zhou's Government Work Report and the reports of Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and we are immensely excited and encouraged. We fully agree and suggest that the congress adopt them. We are workers in the shipbuilding industry and would like to make a brief statement on the development of the shipbuilding industry in recent years.

In 1958, like other industries, China's shipbuilding industry was guided by the Party's General Line for Socialist Construction and inspired by the unprecedented Great Leap Forward in national industry and agriculture. Great achievements were made in scientific research, product design, product manufacturing, and capital construction in the shipbuilding industry, and much experience was accumulated. In 1958, the total tonnage of ships built increased by 242 percent compared to 1957. The design and construction cycles were greatly shortened, and capital construction completed 102 percent of the annual plan.

In terms of scientific research, 284 major projects were completed, and China's first photoelectric remote-controlled automatic tracking cutting machine was successfully trial-produced. In product design, 2,000-horsepower and 3,000-horsepower marine diesel engines were designed and trial-manufactured. The 2,000-horsepower diesel engine has passed the first phase of technical appraisal, proving that all design technical indicators have reached advanced levels. Based on the success of the 2,000-horsepower diesel engine, we have completed the technical design and construction design work for 5,400-horsepower and 8,800-horsepower diesel engines. In particular, the completion of the 8,800-horsepower diesel engine design is of great significance for China's independent development of ocean-going vessels and also opens up broad avenues for the design of other types of diesel engines (such as medium-speed and high-speed diesel engines). Due to the adoption of modern shipbuilding new technology, the cycle on the slipway was greatly shortened, and the construction of 3,000-ton freighters and 1,300-ton ocean-going freighters was completed, shortening the design cycle and completing the design tasks of 5,000-ton Class A passenger and cargo ships, 10,000-ton ocean-going dry cargo ships, and nearly 20 other large and medium-sized designs ahead of schedule. This not only dispelled our superstition that we could not independently design large ocean-going vessels, but also changed the old notion that the design and manufacture of such vessels required a considerable period.

In the past year, we have also given full consideration to the 3 million tons of inland river wooden sailing transport vessels, which account for about two-thirds of the total inland river transportation in the country, and the more than 400,000 tons of wooden sailing fishing vessels, which account for about 90 percent of the country's marine fishing output, in accordance with the principle of giving consideration to both large and small, and combining indigenous and foreign methods. In scientific research, product design, and infrastructure design, we have obtained the cooperation of the Ministry of Communications and the Ministry of Aquatic Products, and dispatched wooden sailing vessel renovation teams, wooden sailing fishing vessel renovation teams, and small shipyard construction teams to visit various places, study typical folk wooden sailing vessels and fishing vessels, improve the design locally, or conduct scientific research and analysis to extract the essence and formulate various stereotypes. At present, the serialization of shallow-water tugboats with a draft of 0.36 to 1.5 meters has been completed, and two mechanization schemes for wooden sailing fishing vessels have been formulated. These works have been listed as one of our main research and design works, and are currently being continued. In order to face the whole country, we have published an atlas of inland river vessels and will continue to publish a ship design manual, a small diesel engine atlas, and an auxiliary engine design atlas, so that small shipyards in provinces along rivers and coasts can design and manufacture small ships by themselves. Various design units and enterprise units have also trained shipbuilding and main and auxiliary engine design and manufacturing technicians and cadres for various provinces.

1959 is a decisive year in our country's three years of hard work, a year of greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in the country, and a year of great leap forward in the shipbuilding industry. Steel is the basic material of the shipbuilding industry, and electricity is the main driving force of the shipbuilding industry. We deeply realize the profound significance of "with steel, there is ship, without electricity, it is difficult to build a ship". We resolutely support the Party Central Committee's policy of taking steel as the key link, mobilize all forces, and speed up the realization of the six guarantees tasks. We firmly believe that as long as we continue to implement the Party's General Line for Socialist Construction and resolutely implement the Party's working method of relying on the masses, we will be able to complete or over fulfill the glorious task of the Great Leap Forward in 1959.

On the eve of the great development of China's shipbuilding industry, we should do the following technical preparation work under the principle of the whole country acting as one chess game.

(1) Formulate a national shipyard layout plan
After liberation, a number of shipyards have been newly built or expanded in various parts of the country, which has initially reversed the situation in the past where shipyards were concentrated in one or two coastal areas. However, China has more than 12,000 kilometers of coastline and more than 400,000 kilometers of navigable waterways. With only the current few shipyards, it is difficult to cope with the future development of civil ships and to meet the needs of national defense construction. Therefore, on the eve of the great development of the shipbuilding industry, it is necessary to formulate a national shipyard layout plan, construct a preliminary queuing scheme, and actively carry out surveying, drilling, plant master plan design and cost estimation. In this way, once construction is needed, it can be started at any time. The cost and labor required for this work are also very small, and should be started as soon as possible under the principle of overall planning and comprehensive consideration.

(2) In order to master the cutting-edge technology of the shipbuilding industry, scientific research should be further strengthened
After liberation, in addition to the Shipbuilding Industry Research Institute jointly established by the First Ministry of Machinery Industry and the Ministry of Communications, some research institutions of different scales have also been established in universities, colleges, factories, and other ship-using departments. These research units have also made some achievements in these years, promoting the continuous progress of the shipbuilding industry. However, China's shipbuilding industry has a weak foundation, and the scale of existing research units is far from meeting the needs of increasingly developing science and technology. In order to overcome cutting-edge technologies and reach the world level, it is necessary to study high-speed, high-parameter ships, ship machinery and instruments, etc. For this reason, it is hoped that relevant departments can quickly complete the capital construction projects of the approved large-scale scientific research institutions and put them into production, so as to create material conditions for further development of ship scientific research work.

(3) Train and supplement the necessary technical cadres
In recent years, the number of technical personnel in the shipbuilding industry has increased more than tenfold compared with the early days of liberation. However, according to actual needs, it is still far from enough. The electrical engineering profession is even more insufficient. It is recommended that shipbuilding departments be gradually added to universities and colleges to cultivate new forces, and at the same time, a large number of training should be carried out in scientific research, design institutions and shipbuilding enterprise departments to provide a large number of technical forces for the future construction or expansion of shipyards and new scientific research institutions.

(4) Scientific research, product design, product trial manufacturing, trial use and appraisal, etc.
At present, the number of new products that have been put into manufacturing and use is still small. In order to improve the correct technicality and economy of products, trial production and appraisal are necessary. For example, diesel engines, high-parameter steam turbines, gas turbines, new instruments, etc., must be test-run in the factory (or before installation) after trial manufacturing to determine whether they meet the design technical indicators. At the same time, the user departments should notify the design and manufacturing departments of the operating conditions at any time during the ship's navigation to gradually improve them, so as to provide a strong guarantee for batch production. Therefore, the design, production and user departments should be combined with each other, fully cooperate, and provide research data, which will play a great role in scientific research. Since the materials and labor used in trial-manufacturing these products are limited, it is hoped that the relevant departments will designate special factories for each trial-manufactured product as a national plan and carry them out separately and complete them on schedule.

In order to do the above work well, we must conscientiously study and implement the Party Central Committee's guidelines and policies, and at the same time, adhere to learning the advanced experience of Soviet science and technology, and make more and greater contributions in the Great Leap Forward. Whether the above opinions are appropriate, please criticize and correct them.

    造船工业的新成就
    杨俊生　萨本炘代表的联合发言
    我们听了周总理的政府工作报告和李富春，李先念两位副总理，彭真副委员长的各项报告后，感到无比的兴奋和鼓舞，并表示完全同意，建议大会予以通过。我们是造船工业工作者，现就近年来造船工业发展情况，作一简单发言。
    一九五八年，我国造船工业同其他工业一样，得到党的社会主义建设总路线的指引，和全国工农业的史无前例的大跃进的鼓舞，造船工业的科学研究，产品设计，产品制造，基本建设各方面均取得了很大的成就，并积累了许多经验。一九五八年造船总吨位比一九五七年增长了百分之二百四十二，设计和建造周期都大大缩短，基本建设完成年度计划的百分之一百零二。
    在科学研究方面完成了二百八十四项重大课题，并试制成功了我国第一台光电遥控自动跟踪切割机；在产品设计方面，设计和试造完成了二千马力和三千马力的船用柴油机；二千马力柴油机已经过了第一阶段技术鉴定，证明了一切设计技术指标都已达到先进水平；在二千马力柴油机成功的基础上，我们又完成了五千四百马力和八千八百马力柴油机的技术设计和施工设计的工作；特别是八千八百马力柴油机设计工作的完成，对我国独立发展远洋船舶具有极重大的意义，也为设计其他类型柴油机（如中速、高速柴油机等）开辟了广阔的道路。由于采用了现代造船新工艺技术，大大缩短了船台周期，完成了三千吨货轮和一千三百吨远洋货轮的建造，与缩短设计周期，提前完成五千吨甲种客货轮，一万吨远洋干货轮及其他近二十种大、中型设计任务；这不仅破除了我们不能独立设计大型远洋船舶的迷信，同时也改变了那种认为设计和制造此类船舶周期需要相当长的旧观念。
    去年来，对于约占全国内河运输三分之二的三百万吨内河木帆运输船和约占全国海洋渔捞产量百分之九十的四十多万吨木帆渔船，我们也按照大小兼顾，土洋并举的方针，充分予以研究。在科学研究，产品设计，基建设计各方面取得了交通，水产两部的协作，派出了改造木帆船小组，改造木帆渔船小组及小船厂建设小组，分赴各地访问，研究民间典型的木帆船及渔船，或就近改良设计，或予以科学研究分析，去粗存精，拟定各种定型。目前已完成零点三六至一点五公尺吃水浅水拖轮系列化，并制订两种木帆渔船机械化方案；这些工作已列为我们研究设计主要工作之一，现正继续进行中，我们为面向全国，曾刊发了内河船舶图册，还将继续出版船舶设计手册，小型柴油机图册，附机设计图册等，以便滨江，滨河的各省小型船厂，能自行设计和制造小型船舶。各设计单位及企业单位，也为各省培训了船舶及主副机设计和制造技术工人及干部。
    一九五九年是我国苦战三年里有决定意义的一年，是全国更大，更好，更全面跃进的一年，也是造船工业大跃进的一年。钢铁是造船工业的基本材料，电力是造船工业主要动力。我们深刻认识到有钢才有船，无电难造船的深刻意义。我们坚决拥护党中央以钢为纲的方针，动员一切力量，加紧实现六保任务。我们深信，只要继续贯彻执行党的社会主义建设总路线和坚决执行党的依靠群众的工作方法，我们是一定能够完成或超额完成一九五九年大跃进的光荣任务。
    在我国造船工业大发展的前夕，我们应该在全国一盘棋的方针下，做好如下几点技术准备工作。
    （一）制定全国造船厂布局规划
    解放后，全国各地陆续新建或扩建了若干造船厂，初步扭转了过去造船厂集中滨海一、二地区的局面，但我国拥有一万二千余公里的海岸线，四十余万公里可通航运的航道，仅有目前的少数造船厂，势难应付未来民用船舶发展的局面，也难满足海防建设的需要，因此，在造船工业大发展的前夕，有必要拟定全国船厂布局规划，建设排队初步方案，积极进行勘察，钻探，厂总平面图设计及经费估算等工作。这样做，一旦需要进行建设时，就随时可以动工。而这一工作所需费用及劳动力，亦属无几，应在统筹兼顾的原则下，尽速着手进行。
    （二）为掌握船舶工业尖端技术，应进一步加强科学研究工作
    解放后，除一机部，交通部曾经合办造船工业研究所一处外，目前大学，高等学院，工厂，及其他用船部门也建立了一些规模不同的研究机构。这些研究单位，在这几年中也都做出一些成绩，推动造船事业不断前进，但是我国造船工业的底子薄，而现有的研究单位，其规模还远不能满足科学技术日益发展的需要。为了攻克尖端，达到世界水平，有必要研究高速度，高参数的船舶，船机及仪表等等，为此，希望有关部门，能将已批准的大型科学研究机构的基本建设工程，迅速予以完成，投入生产，为进一步发展船舶科学研究工作创造物质条件。
    （三）培养和补充必需的技术干部
    这几年造船工业技术人员人数，与解放初期相比，已增加到十倍以上。但按实际需要，还差得很多。其中电气专业更感不足。建议在大学、高等专科学校逐步增设造船系，以培养新生力量，同时在科学研究，设计机构和造船企业部门，大量进行培训，为今后新建或扩建船厂及新的科学研究机构，提供大批技术力量。
    （四）科学研究，产品设计，产品试造、试用及鉴定等工作
    目前新产品已投入制造和使用的为数尚少。为了提高产品正确技术性及经济性，试制及鉴定实属必要，如柴油机，高参数蒸汽轮机，燃气轮机，新型仪表等等，试造完毕后，一定在出厂前（或安装前）进行厂内试运转，鉴定是否符合设计技术指标，同时使用部门在船舶航行中，将运转状况随时通知设计及制造部门逐步改进，使成批生产得到有力保证，因此，设计、生产及使用部门，三者应相互结合，充分协作，提供研究资料，这对科学研究工作将会起很大作用。由于试制这些产品的使用材料及劳动力均属有限，希望有关部门将各试制产品分别指定专厂，作为国家计划，分别进行，按期完成。
    为了做好以上工作，我们必须认真学习和执行党中央的方针、政策，同时，坚持学习苏联科学及技术的先进经验，在大跃进中作出更多，更大的贡献。以上意见是否有当，请各位代表批评，指正。
