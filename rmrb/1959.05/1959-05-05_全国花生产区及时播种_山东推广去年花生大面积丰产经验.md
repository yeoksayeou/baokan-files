Xinhua News Agency, 4th: Peanut producing areas across the country have generally begun sowing peanuts. Guangdong, Guangxi, Fujian and other provinces and autonomous regions that started sowing earlier have already finished their sowing work, and farmers in the Yangtze, Yellow, and Huai River basins are busy sowing.

This year, the peanut fields in various regions have mostly been deep ploughed to six or seven inches or more. In Laibin and other counties in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, the general depth of ploughing is eight to ten inches, three to seven inches deeper than last year. Some areas have also adopted the method of moving soil to fill holes to deepen the soil layer. The amount of fertilizer applied to peanut fields in various regions has generally been doubled or more compared to last year. Most areas have inoculated seeds with rhizobia. Peanut seeds in Zhangpu and other counties in Fujian Province are carefully selected good varieties such as "Dali Zao" and "Goubi Sheng", and the triangular close planting method has been widely promoted during sowing.

Many areas have arranged peanut sowing work early and are sowing quickly. In Zhangpu County, Fujian Province, 100,000 people were mobilized to fight for four days, planting more than 60,000 mu of peanuts, successfully completing the task. Based on high-yield experience and local climate conditions, the Daoxian County Party Committee in Hunan Province arranged peanut sowing work early, advancing the sowing period by more than ten days, and overfulfilled the sowing plan by 20%.

In order to ensure an increase in peanut production this year, Shandong, Henan and other provinces have successively held peanut production conferences. The Shandong Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial People's Committee issued instructions, requiring all localities to ensure the completion of the sowing plan and to universally implement the responsibility system of "tasks assigned to teams, management assigned to groups, measures assigned to fields, and responsibility assigned to individuals." On the basis of summarizing last year's bumper peanut harvest, Hongan County, Hubei Province, adopted ten major measures including deep ploughing, sufficient fertilizer, close planting, ensuring full stands, and eliminating diseases and insect pests. From the county to the team, special personnel were assigned at each level to lead peanut production.

Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, 4th: Peanut sowing in Shandong Province, the country's main peanut producing area, has begun from south to north. The province plans to plant 10 million mu of peanuts this year, an increase of nearly 2 million mu compared to last year. The total peanut output is also required to increase significantly compared to last year's actual harvest.

This year, 38 major peanut producing counties and cities in Shandong Province have assigned a county party secretary or county head to be solely responsible for leading peanut production. Since the beginning of spring, party committees at all levels have also inspected the preparatory work for peanut sowing. People's communes in counties such as Penglai, Qixia, and Rizhao have universally assigned peanut planting tasks, management work, and measures to ensure increased production to teams, groups, and fields, and assigned special personnel to be responsible at each level, so that plans are implemented and take root. The grain departments in Yantai and Linyi prefectures also selected large white-skinned peanuts from the peanuts purchased to supply people's communes that are expanding peanut planting areas as seeds. Yexian, Rizhao, Penglai and other places have also adopted the method of pricing according to quality and purchasing with cash to adjust peanut seeds.

When sowing peanuts, all localities have grasped the main links of increasing production, such as preparing land for deep ploughing, increasing base fertilizer application, and selecting seeds for sprouting, based on the experience of many large-scale high-yield production last year. According to statistics, more than 90% of the peanut fields in the province have been deep ploughed to eight inches to one foot or more, and the amount of base fertilizer applied has generally increased by about double compared to last year. The People's Communes in Penglai, Qixia, and Laiyang counties, which are high-yield peanut areas, have also vigorously promoted the gardenization of peanut cultivation, combining deep ploughing with the application of more than 15,000 jin of fertilizer per mu in layers. The People's Communes in the three prefectures of Yantai, Linyi, and Liaocheng have broken the previous habit of not watering peanuts, and have increased the construction of mechanized wells and ponds in peanut fields, turning nearly half of the dry land into drought-resistant and flood-resistant fields that can be irrigated.

In order to do a good job in production guidance, cadres at all levels in Shandong Province have planted more than 3 million mu of high-yield experimental fields this year.

    全国花生产区及时播种
    山东推广去年花生大面积丰产经验
    新华社4日讯　全国花生产区普遍开始播种花生。开始播种较早的广东、广西、福建等省、区播种工作已经结束，长江和黄河、淮河流域的农民正忙着播种。
    今年各地的花生地大都深耕六七寸以上，广西僮族自治区的来宾等县一般深耕八到十寸，比去年加深三到七寸，有的地区还采用了移土填穴的办法加深土层。各地花生地的施肥量大都比去年增加一倍以上。大部分地区进行了根瘤菌拌种，福建省的漳浦等县花生种子都是精选过的“大粒早”“勾鼻生”等良种，并且在播种时普遍推行了三角密植法。
    许多地区花生播种工作安排早，播得快。福建省漳浦县动员了十万大军奋战四天，就种了六万多亩花生，胜利完成任务；湖南省道县县委根据丰产经验及当地气候条件，及早安排花生播种工作，播种期提早了十多天，并且超额20％完成播种计划。
    为了保证今年花生增产，山东、河南等省还相继召开了花生生产会议。中共山东省委和省人民委员会分别发出指示，要求各地保证完成播种计划，普遍推行
  “任务到队、管理到组、措施到田，责任到人”的责任制度。湖北省红安县在总结去年花生大丰收的基础上，采取了深耕、足肥、密植、全苗、消灭病虫等十大措施，从县到队，层层设有专人领导花生生产。
    新华社济南4日电　全国主要花生产区——山东省的花生播种工作已经由南向北开始。全省今年计划种植花生一千万亩，比去年增加近二百万亩，花生总产量也要求比去年实际收获量有很大增加。
    山东省三十八个主要产花生的县市今年都确定一个县委书记或县长专职领导花生生产。入春以来，各级党委还对花生播种的准备工作作了检查。蓬莱、栖霞、日照等县的人民公社把花生的种植任务、管理工作和保证增产的措施普遍安排到队、组、田，并且层层有专人负责，使计划落实扎根。烟台和临沂专区的粮食部门，还从收购的花生中拣出白皮大粒的供给扩大花生种植面积的人民公社作种籽。掖县、日照、蓬莱等地也采取以质论价，现钱收购的方法，对花生种子进行了调剂。
    各地在播种花生时都根据去年许多大面积高额丰产的经验，抓紧了整地深耕、增施底肥和选种催芽等主要增产环节。据统计，全省花生地深耕八寸至一尺以上的占90％，施底肥量普遍比去年增加一倍左右。花生高产地区蓬莱、栖霞和莱阳县的人民公社，还大力推行了花生耕作园田化，结合深翻每亩分层施肥一万五千多斤。烟台、临沂和聊城三个专区的人民公社打破往年花生不浇水的习惯，在花生田里增修机井、水塘，使近半数的旱田变成可以灌溉的旱涝保收田。
    为作好生产指导，山东省各级干部今年共种丰产试验田三百多万亩。
