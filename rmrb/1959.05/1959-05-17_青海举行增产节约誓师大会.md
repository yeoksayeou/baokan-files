A province-wide movement for increased production and thrift is unfolding in Qinghai Province.

On the morning of May 12th, the Qinghai Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened a swearing-in rally for increased production and thrift, attended by 50,000 worker and peasant representatives. At the meeting, Tan Shengbin, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Qinghai Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, delivered a report on how to carry out the movement for increased production and thrift. Afterwards, representatives from various units reported to the meeting on the progress of the movement in their respective units and expressed their determination. Zhang Jinsheng, representative of the Qinghai Province First-Class Advanced Production Unit, the Fourth Truck Team of the Transportation Bureau, reported to the meeting on the team's progress in the movement for increased production and thrift, and on behalf of the entire team, expressed their intention to take effective measures to advance towards the goal of "safety, thrift, and 10,000 ton-kilometers per month," and to hand over 3 million yuan in profits to the state for the entire year. The representative of the Living Management Office of the Xining Railway Bureau proposed to save grain, ensure that employees are well-fed, maintain cleanliness and hygiene, and ensure the health of employees.

Various prefectures and counties that listened to the live broadcast outside the venue also called in by long distance to express their determination to do a good job in increasing production and practicing thrift. Commune members from Ledu County called to say: We will guarantee the completion of this year's grain production plan, ensuring that every mu of land is managed by someone. Hualong County, in its phone call, not only guaranteed to overfulfill this year's production plans for grain, oil crops, and vegetables, but also to do a good job in sideline production, ensuring that every household raises pigs and chickens. In less than an hour, the conference received more than 790 letters of guarantee and resolutions from various units, unanimously expressing their determination to deeply develop the movement for increased production and thrift, and to guarantee the completion and overfulfillment of this year's production plans and work tasks.

Prior to this swearing-in rally, various parts of Qinghai Province had already started activities to increase production and practice thrift. In the Xining area, in the last ten days, provincial and municipal organizations, military units, various factories, mines, enterprises, schools, residents, etc., after repeated mobilization, unleashed vigorous debates and discussions, posted big-character posters, and formulated plans for increasing production and practicing thrift at all levels. Employees of various units have posted more than 100,000 big-character posters, putting forward tens of thousands of rationalization proposals for increasing production and practicing thrift. Some units with faster action have already seen results in the movement for increased production and practicing thrift. Employees of the Xining Iron and Steel Plant are using their spare time to bake cinders and ore powder into sintered iron, which can increase the country's wealth by more than 780,000 yuan throughout the year. Employees of the Xining Agricultural and Animal Husbandry Machinery Plant cleaned up the warehouse and picked up scrap iron and waste materials. In early May, they had already used scrap iron to manufacture 4,000 hoes and a large number of small hardware items. The Xining New Life Casting Factory has formulated a method for using electricity separately for production, offices, and dormitories, which not only saves electricity consumption but also saves electricity costs of over 900 yuan throughout the year.

    青海举行增产节约誓师大会
    本报讯　青海省的增产节约运动，正在全面铺开。
    12日上午，中共青海省委召开了有五万工农代表参加的增产节约誓师大会。会上，中共青海省委书记处书记谭生彬作了关于如何开展增产节约运动的报告，接着各单位的代表即纷纷向大会报告本单位开展增产节约运动的情况并表示了决心。青海省一等先进生产单位、运输局汽车四队张金生代表，向大会汇报了他们队开展增产节约运动的情况，并代表全队表示要采取有效措施，向“安全、节约、月产万吨公里”的目标前进；全年为国家上交利润三百万元。西宁铁路局生活管理处代表提出要节约粮食，保证职工们吃饱吃好，搞好清洁卫生，保证职工身体健康。
    在会场外面收听实况广播的各州、县也打来长途电话，表示搞好增产节约的决心。乐都县公社社员打来的电话说：保证完成今年粮食生产计划，做到每亩田有人管理。化隆县在电话中除保证超额完成今年粮食、油料、蔬菜的生产计划外，还要搞好副业生产，做到户户养猪养鸡。不到一个钟头的时间，大会就收到了各单位的保证书、决心书七百九十多份。一致表示，要决心深入开展增产节约运动，保证完成和超额完成今年的生产计划和工作任务。
    在这次誓师大会举行之前，青海省各地即已开始了增产节约的活动。西宁地区在最近十天以来，省市机关、驻军部队和各个厂矿企业、学校、居民等，经过反复动员，大鸣大放，贴大字报，并层层制定了增产节约计划。各单位职工已贴出大字报十万多张，提出的增产节约合理化建议达数万件。行动较迅速的一些单位，增产节约运动已收到成效。西宁炼铁厂的职工们，利用业余时间把焦渣和矿石粉焙烧成烧结铁，全年可以为国家增加七十八万多元的财富。西宁农牧机械厂职工清理了仓库，拣废铁废料，5月上旬已利用废铁碎料制造了四千把镢头和大量小五金。西宁新生铸件厂拟定了生产、办公和宿舍分别用电的办法，既节省了用电量，全年又可节约电费九百几十元。
