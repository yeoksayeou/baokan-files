Compete in Redness, Diligence, and Skill
Male and Female Commune Members and Cadres at All Levels in Qin County, Shanxi Province, Strive to be Advanced

Taiyuan, May 13th (This newspaper dispatch) - A "Redness, Diligence, and Skill" competition movement, aiming to "Learn from Tianzhu, catch up with Dongguo, chase Jiangkao, and emulate Li Rui," and with the purpose of increasing labor productivity, has unfolded in Qin County, Shanxi Province. According to typical investigations, labor efficiency has increased by approximately 26% since the movement began.

The CCP Qin County Committee, in order to solve the problem of labor shortages, studied the advanced deeds of some commune members in improving labor efficiency and improving tools. It was decided to launch a labor competition movement throughout the county with the slogan "Men learn from Tianzhu, women learn from Dongguo, cadres learn from Jiangkao, and everyone learns from Li Rui." And based on the dialectical relationship of "Redness promotes Diligence" and "Practice makes perfect," it called on every commune member to strive for "Redness," "Diligence," and "Skill."

Adopting diverse forms of competition, with new waves constantly pushing the old forward.

Matching opponents, engaging in close combat, this is the common form adopted in competitions throughout the county. First, mobilize the vast number of commune members to self-report labor days, and formulate quarterly and monthly labor input plans. Then, commune members choose generals and select troops, make direct contact, find opponents for each other, issue challenge letters, and the production team posts announcements to strengthen the determination of both sides to win. Evaluations are conducted every seven days, ten days, or at most half a month. During this period, they report on labor input to each other, encourage each other, and promote progress. At the end of a competition, commune members find new opponents and set up new opposing sides to start new battles.

Establishing "pacesetters," with the masses chasing and catching up, this is the form adopted in most areas. Guo Village Management District (the hometown of Wang Dongguo) summarized Wang Dongguo's typical deeds and launched a movement of "Women learning from Dongguo, men also learning from Dongguo." Huo Fuwang said to Wang Dongguo: "Last year you were a model, this year we'll see who is the hero!" Female Deputy Director Long Lanxiang, on behalf of all women, proposed a plan to have one hundred and seventy-eight Dongguo-style "female champions" this year. Thus, the competition movement unfolded vigorously.

Chengguan, Hanhong and other areas also adopted the method of "singing opposite tunes" for collective competition. Li Qizhong and Wang Chengzhong, two work groups in Guo Dao Commune,展开竞赛。展开竞赛 on the same "battlefield," with the same "forces," the same "weapons," and the same task, launched a competition in rice seedling cultivation. As a result, Li Qizhong's group adopted a "hundred-hole funnel" (similar to a noodle strainer) to sow seeds, combining diligence and skill, and completed the task of cultivating one mu of seedlings within three days (including leveling the ground and arranging the ridges), sowing seeds very evenly, and collectively exceeding the quota by 47%. Although Wang Chengzhong's group also completed the task at the same time, exceeding the quota by 21%, the sowing was not uniform enough.

Selecting a date, breaking the quota, this is the form adopted in Changsheng and other areas. Generally, the third, sixth, ninth, or fifth and tenth of each month are designated as "quota breaking days." On these days, the production team informs the commune members of the work location, what to do, the quota, quality standards, and remuneration, so that the commune members have a clear understanding and strive to break the quota under the premise of ensuring quality. Taking Duanliu Management District as an example, in the seventh production team's "quota breaking day" on April 15th, five out of seven women broke the quota. Li Yongmei did five kinds of work in one day, earning seventeen points, more than double the base points. The team issued a certificate of honor, and the management district wrote her name on the honor roll.

Large interlocking small links, this is the more common form of competition in the current spring sowing stage. The large link is the mutual competition between districts and teams, sending representatives to each other to labor together and "learn from experience," to promote common progress. The small link is in collectively operated farm work, such as planting yams, where the five different operators of digging holes, pouring manure, planting seeds, grabbing fertilizer, and covering soil compete, with mutual supervision, also called "pre- and post-acceptance." This method is very effective during the spring sowing season, both speeding up the spring sowing and improving the sowing quality.

Cultivating production team leaders who are familiar with all-round business, and maximizing the strengths of commune members

Cultivate captains like Zhang Jiangkao to command commune members like Li Tianzhu, Wang Dongguo, and Li Rui. In order to improve leadership and develop this movement to a higher level, each management district has leaders such as the general branch secretary and director personally cultivating "Zhang Jiangkao." The general approach is to help the captain fully familiarize himself with the business from short-term planning, small segment arrangements, revision of quotas, allocation of work, and organization of competitions, so as to lead production with production, and strive to become the "pacesetter" of the entire team. In this way, leadership talents are improved in practice, driving the vast number of commune members and promoting the in-depth development of the movement. After Baihao Management District focused on cultivating粟成玉, the captain of the second team, he worked twenty-six days in eleven days and became a red flag for the entire team. The vast number of commune members are learning from the captain. In addition to 83% of male and female laborers breaking the quota, thirty-one粟成玉-style "pacesetters" have also emerged. After the key areas matured, many management districts organized on-site meetings for team affairs cadres to absorb experience, so that the movement quickly blossomed in all directions.

Clever arrangement of labor management, promoting commune members to work more. This is a measure adopted by most management districts and production teams in organizing competitions. According to the principle of distribution according to work and more pay for more work, the management district and production team divide various farm work into different grades, distinguishing between light and heavy, rough and fine, dirty and clean, safe and dangerous, set quotas, and all laborers are ranked and assessed for base points. People are assigned according to the work, and jobs are adapted to people. The opinions of commune members are adopted as much as possible, so that commune members can choose their own "battlefield" and maximize their skills. In this way, the vast number of commune members have a goal to strive for.

More and more people do not waste time and do not travel empty-handed, and diligent labor has become a trend.

"Millions of stars in the sky, but never so many new things as today." Although the Redness, Diligence, and Skill labor harvest competition movement has only been going on for more than twenty days, it has already had an immediate effect. More and more people are cleverly arranging farm work, vigorously carrying out innovation, not wasting time, and not traveling empty-handed. Not being picky about fat and lean, not avoiding the heavy and taking the easy, not being afraid of hardship, not being afraid of fatigue, not being afraid of danger, diligent and unremitting, honest labor, cleverly planning and working, "finding tigers to fight," has become a trend in the county. According to incomplete statistics from April 1st to 20th, the county's 99,000 male and female full and half agricultural laborers and more than 10,000 county, commune, district, and team cadres in the countryside reported nearly 40,000 labor days, an increase of 103% compared to the original labor plan. From the labor performance of the twenty days, each male full laborer worked an average of 26.3 days, and each male half laborer worked 21.1 days; each female full laborer worked 21 days, and each female half laborer worked 13.9 days; cadres worked an average of 22.7 days. The county has reformed and promoted more than 60,000 various tools for deep plowing, land preparation, close planting, transportation, processing, and stoves. 2,988 male commune members of the Li Tianzhu type, 2,643 female commune members of the Wang Dongguo type, 1,061 male and female commune members of the Li Rui type, and 765 cadres of the Zhang Jiangkao type have emerged.

### 赛红  赛勤  赛巧  山西沁县男女社员各级干部奋勇争先

    赛红  赛勤  赛巧
    山西沁县男女社员各级干部奋勇争先
    本报太原13日电  一个以“学天柱、赶东果、追江考、赛李锐”为目标，以提高劳动生产率为目的的“红、勤、巧”竞赛运动，在山西省沁县展开。据典型调查，运动开展后，劳动效率约提高26％。
    中共沁县县委为了解决劳动力不足的问题，研究了一些社员在提高劳动效率和改进工具方面的先进事迹以后，决定在全县范围内掀起一个“男人学天柱、妇女学东果、干部学江考、人人学李锐”的劳动竞赛运动。并且根据
  “红能促勤”，“熟能生巧”的辩证关系，号召每个社员力争“勤”、“巧”、“红”。
    采取多种多样的竞赛形式，后浪催前浪不断前进
    棋逢对手，短兵相接，这是全县各地竞赛中普遍采用的形式。首先发动广大社员自报劳动日，订出分季分月投工计划，然后由社员点兵选将，直线联系，互找对手，互下战书，生产队出榜公布，坚定对垒双方的必胜信念。每七天、十天、最多半月评比一次。在这期间，互报投工情况，互相鼓舞促进，到期公布战果。一段竞赛结束之后，社员另找新的对手，树立新的对立面，开展新的战斗。
    树立“标兵”，群追众赶，这是多数地区采用的形式。郭村管理区（王东果的家乡）总结了王东果的典型事例，发动了一个“妇女学东果，男人也学东果”的运动。霍富旺对王东果说：“去年你是模范，今年咱看谁是英雄！”女副主任龙兰香代表全体妇女提出了今年要出现一百七十八个东果式的“女状元”计划。于是，竞赛运动就有声有色地展开了。
    城关、韩洪等地区还采取了“唱对台戏”的方式，集体竞赛。郭道公社李其中和王成中两个作业组，在水稻育秧时，同样“阵地”，同样“兵力”，同样“武器”，同样任务，两军对阵展开竞赛。结果，李其中组采用“百孔漏斗洞”（似捞面条用的笊篱）撒籽，勤巧相结合，三天内即完成育秧一亩的任务（连整地、平畦等在内），撒籽非常均匀，集体突破定额47％。王成中组虽然也在同一时间完成，突破定额21％，但撒籽不够均匀。
    选定日期，大破定额，这是长盛等地区采用的形式。一般选定每月的三、六、九或逢五、逢十，定为
  “突破定额日”。每逢此日，由生产队向社员交代做活地点、干什么活、定额多少、质量标准、报酬多少，使社员心中有数，在保证质量的前提下，力争突破定额。以段柳管理区为例，第七生产队在4月15日的“突破定额日”里，七个妇女就有五个突破了定额。李永梅一天做了五种活，得到十七分，超过底分一倍。队里发给光荣证，管理区给写上了光荣榜。
    大连环套小连环，这是目前春播阶段较为普遍的竞赛形式。大连环是区、队之间互相竞赛，互派代表到对方，边劳动，边“取经”，共同促进。小连环是在集体操作的农活上，如点种山药，由刨窝、倒圊、点籽、抓粪、复土等五种不同的操作者展开竞赛，连环监督，也叫做“前后验收”。这种方法在春播时期运用起来非常得心应手，既加快了春播速度，又提高了播种质量。
    培养熟悉全面业务的生产队长，尽量发挥社员的特长
    培养张江考式的队长，指挥李天柱式、王东果式、李锐式的社员。全县各地为了提高领导水平，使这个运动向更高的水平发展，每个管理区都由总支书记、主任等领导干部亲自培养“张江考”。一般的做法是：帮助队长从短期计划、小段安排、修制定额、分配活计、组织竞赛等方面，全面熟悉业务，以生产领导生产，力争成为全队的“标兵”。这样，就在实践中提高了领导才干，带动了广大社员，促进了运动向纵深发展。白郝管理区把第二队队长粟成玉当作培养重点之后，在十一天内投工二十六个，成为全队的一面红旗。广大社员都向队长学习。除83％的男女劳力突破定额外，还出现了三十一个粟成玉式的“标兵”。许多管理区在重点成熟之后，组织各队队务干部召开了现场会议，吸取了经验，使运动很快全面开花。
    劳动管理巧安排，促进社员多投工。这是绝大部分管理区和生产队在组织竞赛中采用的措施。根据按劳取酬、多劳多得的原则，由管理区和生产队把各种农活分别等级，分别轻重、粗细、脏净、安险，定出定额，所有劳力排队评定底分，因事用人，因人制宜，尽量采纳社员意见，使社员自选“用武之地”，尽量发挥社员一技之长。这样就使广大社员都有了奋斗目标。
    时不空过、路不空行的人越来越多，勤奋劳动形成风气
    “天上繁星千万颗，没有今日新事多”。全县开展红勤巧劳动丰收竞赛运动虽然仅有二十多天的时间，但已经立竿见影。巧排农活、大搞革新、时不空过、路不空行的人越来越多。不挑肥拣瘦，不躲重就轻，不怕苦，不怕累，不怕险，勤奋不懈，诚实劳动，巧计巧干，“找虎而打”，在全县成为风气。据4月1日到20日的不完全统计：全县九万九千个男女全半农业劳力和一万多个县、社、区、队在乡干部，共报投劳动日近四万个，较原来的投工计划提高103％。从二十天的劳动实绩看：男全劳力每人平均投工二十六点三个，男半劳力二十一点一个；女全劳力二十一个，女半劳力十三点九个；干部平均二十二点七个。全县共改革推广深耕、整地、密植、运输、加工、灶具等各种工具六万多件。出现李天柱式的男社员二千九百八十八个；王东果式的女社员二千六百四十三个；李锐式的男女社员一千零六十一个；张江考式的干部七百六十五个。〔附注〕李天柱
