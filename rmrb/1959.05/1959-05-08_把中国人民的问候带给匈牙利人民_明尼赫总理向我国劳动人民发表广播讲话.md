Xinhua News Agency, 7th. Tonight, the Central People's Broadcasting Station broadcast the radio address of Münich Ferenc, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party and Prime Minister of the Hungarian Worker-Peasant Revolutionary Government, to the working people of our country. The full text is as follows: Dear comrades, dear listeners,

　　I am very happy to be able to speak to the working people of the People's Republic of China through the radio station. First of all, I would like to take this opportunity to directly convey the warm greetings of the Hungarian working people, the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, the Worker-Peasant Revolutionary Government, and the Hungarian Party and Government delegation who have been so warmly received by you.

　　We know that no matter how far away Hungary is from China, you are all concerned about socialist Hungary, about what has happened in our country in the past and present. Therefore, I can take advantage of this opportunity to tell you that not long ago, two and a half years ago, the Hungarian people went through a difficult period and spent a few heavy days, even a few heavy weeks. The counter-revolution prepared and supported by foreign imperialism and domestic reactionaries organized by revisionism plunged our country into an almost hopeless crisis. But the working people of our country have already proved hundreds of times in the Soviet Republic period of 1919 and since then that they have been permanently linked to socialism. They lived comfortably in the people's democratic system, regarded the people's democratic system as their own, and worked for the people's democratic system. In this way, in order to overcome the counter-revolutionary rebellion and heal the wounds of the country destroyed by the counter-revolution, the help that our people received from the socialist camp countries, the great Soviet Union, from your Chinese comrades and other fraternal nations, did not fall into the hands of people who should not have received it. Please allow me here, in front of the radio audience, to also thank you for the self-sacrifice you have made for us.

　　Today, we can already say that not only in terms of time, but also in terms of political, economic and cultural development, we have far exceeded the situation in the counter-revolutionary period. Countless examples show that the vast majority of the working people of our country firmly believe in and follow our Party and government. In Hungary, it is no longer a matter of restoring the losses caused by the counter-revolution, but of continuing to build socialism, successfully implementing the three-year plan, and preparing to formulate the five-year plan from 1961 to 1965.

　　You must be very interested in what we saw and felt in the People's Republic of China. Please allow me to talk about the trip of our Party and Government delegation first. The delegation has been visiting the Far Eastern socialist countries for several weeks. From Budapest to Hanoi, we have been traveling in our socialist world. I believe that you will be happy with us if I say that we have felt the healthy atmosphere of our great, powerful and ever-growing young giant, the socialist camp, all the way. We felt at home everywhere, because we are all members of the big family of the socialist camp.

　　We stayed in the People's Republic of China for more than ten days and were warmly received by you. The experiences we had here have produced feelings that can hardly be described in words. It cannot be said that we did not know or had not heard much about your beautiful and rich motherland until now. But now, even though our time here is short, we already feel that our impression of the People's Republic of China and its excellent people has become more real, more vivid, and richer. We have seen proud and conscious people who have won freedom under the leadership of the Party, a sincere love and creative enthusiasm for the socialist motherland that unites your people. Everywhere there is selfless labor, tenacious will and invention and creation. And the most important thing is: the most ordinary labor is also full of true enthusiasm, which can only be generated where conscious hundreds of millions of people work wholeheartedly for a common great cause. If I say that your people trust the Party, that is not enough. In China, the Party and the people are one, the leadership and the masses are one. Although you have only been liberated for less than ten years, your country has made up for what it lacked in the past several centuries. And you have an even brighter future. China has become a great power not only because of its vast land and large population, but primarily because it enjoys undeniable prestige among the people of all countries, especially in Asia and Africa, by its own example, the development and speed of socialism, the improvement of people's lives, and its great strength. Those who do not want to know this are deceiving themselves. Because from a historical point of view, what plays a decisive role is never the opinion of the government, but the opinion of the people. No matter what the predatory imperialism does in a futile attempt to do, no matter what the American imperialist bloc is creating, they can never turn the wheel of history backwards.

　　Now, our visit to the People's Republic of China has come to an end. For these unforgettable experiences, for your hospitality and meticulous care, I would like to directly express my gratitude to the Chinese brothers. I promise that I will definitely convey your greetings to the Hungarian working people after I return. I also, in the name of all the members of the delegation, we will all be more enthusiastic propagandists for the socialist construction being carried out in China.

　　We leave your great country with stronger faith and confidence. We are more firmly convinced that the powerful socialist camp headed the Soviet Union, supported by nearly one billion simple people can defend peace, and thus make invaluable contributions to the future of all mankind.

　　I wish the Communist Party of China and the government of the People's Republic of China and the powerful Chinese people many achievements in socialist construction.

　　Strive for world peace!

### 把中国人民的问候带给匈牙利人民  明尼赫总理向我国劳动人民发表广播讲话

　　把中国人民的问候带给匈牙利人民
    明尼赫总理向我国劳动人民发表广播讲话
    新华社7日讯　中央人民广播电台今晚广播了匈牙利社会主义工人党中央委员会政治局委员、匈牙利工农革命政府总理明尼赫·费伦茨向我国劳动人民作的广播讲话，全文如下：亲爱的同志们，亲爱的听众们，
    我非常高兴可以通过广播电台向中华人民共和国的劳动人民讲话。首先我利用这个机会直接转达匈牙利劳动人民，匈牙利社会主义工人党，工农革命政府和受到你们盛情款待的匈牙利党政代表团的热烈的问候。
    我们知道，不管我国离开中国多远，你们都在关心着社会主义的匈牙利，关心我国的过去和现在发生的事情。因此，我可以利用给我提供的这个机会告诉你们，在不久以前，在二年半以前，匈牙利人民经历了困难的时期，渡过了几天沉重的日子，甚至是几个沉重的星期。外国帝国主义和本国反动派组织的修正主义所准备和支持的反革命，把我国卷入了几乎是绝望的危境。但是我国劳动人民已经在1919年苏维埃共和国时期和从那时以来成百次地证明了，他们已经与社会主义永久地结合起来了。他们在人民民主制度时期过得舒畅，把人民民主制度看作是自己的，并为了人民民主制度而劳动。这样为了战胜反革命叛乱和医治被反革命破坏的国家的创伤，我国人民从社会主义阵营各国，伟大的苏联，从你们中国同志和其他各兄弟民族那里所得到的帮助并不是落到了不应该得的人手里。请允许我在这里，在广播电台公众面前，也感谢你们为我们所作的自我牺牲。
    今天，我们已经可以说，不仅在时间上，而在政治、经济和文化发展上也远远超过反革命时期的状况。无数事例说明我国劳动人民的绝大多数坚信和追随我们的党和政府，在匈牙利早就不是恢复反革命造成的损失，而是在进行着继续建设社会主义的工作，胜利地执行着三年计划，并正在准备制订1961年到1965年的五年计划。
    你们一定很关心我们在中华人民共和国看到些什么，有些什么感想。请首先容许我谈一谈有关我们党政代表团的这次行程。代表团几个星期来在远东社会主义国家进行了访问。从布达佩斯到河内一直是在我们社会主义世界上旅行的。我相信，假如我说我们一路上感觉到我们伟大、有力和不断成长的年青的巨人——社会主义阵营的健康的气息，你们也会同我们一起感到高兴。我们到处都感觉到像在家里一样，因为我们都是社会主义阵营大家庭中的一员。
    我们在中华人民共和国呆了十多天，受到你们的盛情款待。我们在这里的体会使我们产生的感情，几乎不是言语所能形容的。不能说，我们直到现在还不知道，或是没有听说过许多关于你们美好和富饶的祖国的情况。但是现在，尽管我们在这儿的时间很短，却已经感到，我们对中华人民共和国和它优秀的人民的印象变得更真实、更逼真、更丰富了。我们看到了在党的领导下为赢得了自由而自豪的、有觉悟的人民，对社会主义祖国的真诚的热爱和创造的热情，把你们的人民团结在一起。到处都是忘我的劳动、顽强的意志和发明创造。而最主要的是：最平凡的劳动中也充满着真正的热情，这种热情只有在有觉悟的千百万人全心全意地为共同的伟大事业而工作的地方才会产生。如果我说，你们的人民信任党，那是不够的，在中国，党和人民是一体的，领导和群众是一体的。尽管你们解放才不到十年，可是你们的国家却弥补了过去好几个世纪所欠缺的东西。并且，你们还有着更为光明灿烂的前途。中国之所以成为大国，不仅是由于它地广人多，而首先是由于它以自己的榜样、社会主义的发展及其速度、人民生活的提高、巨大的力量，在世界各国人民中首先是在亚非各国人民中间享有无可否认的威信。那些不愿知道这一点的人是在欺骗自己。因为从历史的观点来看，起决定作用的从来也不是政府的意见，而是人民的意见。不管掠夺成性的帝国主义发出了无力的愤怒企图做些什么，不管美国帝国主义集团在制造些什么，它们无论如何也不能使历史的车轮向后倒转。
    现在，我们在中华人民共和国的访问已经结束，为了这些难忘的体会，为了你们的款待和无微不至的照顾，我愿直接地向中国兄弟也表示感谢。我保证回去以后一定将你们的问候转达给匈牙利劳动人民。我也以代表团全体人员的名义，我们每一个人都将会是中国所进行的社会主义建设的更热情的宣传员。
    我们带着更强的信仰和自信心离开你们伟大的国家。我们更坚定地相信，以苏联为首的强大的社会主义阵营在近十亿纯朴人民支持下能够捍卫和平，并且这样为全人类的未来作出不可估价的贡献。
    祝中国共产党和中华人民共和国政府和强大的中国人民在社会主义建设工作中取得许多成就。
    争取世界和平！
