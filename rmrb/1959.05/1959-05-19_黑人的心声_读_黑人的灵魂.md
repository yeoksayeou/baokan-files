    The Voice of Black People
    ——Reading "The Souls of Black Folk"
    Huang Xingqi
    Recently published by the People's Literature Publishing House, "The Souls of Black Folk" is a collection of essays by the eminent African American peace activist W.E.B. Du Bois. Although this work was written more than fifty years ago, it still has profound practical significance today. The clouds of racial discrimination that hung over African Americans at that time have not dissipated today, and the tragic lives and heartfelt songs of black people still echo in the American sky. This work touches the reader's heart with its powerful force.
    Included in this poetic and imaginative collection are fourteen essays, sketches, and stories. However, the author skillfully weaves them together with a single thread into an organic whole, making them a complete work with a unique style. This thread is the strong desire for liberation of generations of African Americans, and their unyielding struggle to achieve this desire. At the beginning of each chapter of the book, the author attaches a section of black spirituals. As we read on, chapter by chapter, we are immersed in the impassioned spirituals from beginning to end.
    The author first takes us to a period after the American Civil War in the nineteenth century. This was a nominal war to "emancipate slaves," but black people did not gain true liberation from it. With a heavy heart and poetic brushstrokes, the author recounts the experiences of African Americans from the end of the Civil War to the end of the nineteenth century, describing the enslavement suffered by the millions of black people living in the so-called "Black Belt," as well as the many problems they encountered in terms of economy, education, and religion, and explicitly opposed Booker T. Washington's capitulationism in the black liberation movement at that time.
    Based on field investigations and the facts he saw, the author pointed out that the slave system was the root of all suffering for black people, but the result of black people's removal from the slave system did not allow them to escape the abyss of poverty and disaster. They had neither land nor rights, and they were still in a state of slavery. He pointed out that after the Civil War, the American South, which was originally an agricultural region, began to develop along the capitalist road. Landlords gave way to capitalists, who established textile industries and also gained control of cotton production. Black people without land escaped the shackles of slavery only to fall into the clutches of these capitalists. The author merges facts, arguments, poetic sentiment, and imagination. Reading his depiction of the poverty and desolation of African Americans in the American South at that time is like revisiting the history of the American South in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.
    In addition to writing about the general situation of black people, the book also delves into the encounters of African American intellectuals at that time. In many chapters, the author not only depicts the various arduous struggles of African American intellectuals under racial discrimination and oppression, but also deeply portrays their tragic experiences. In the author's writing, we can see how racial discrimination still restricts, oppresses, and devastates African Americans in the United States. Racial discrimination deprives black people of all rights in life and casts its shadow on black children as well. If they want to take a step between white and black, they will be severely hit, even lose their lives. The author's descriptions in these areas are real, profound, and touching. When we read essays like "Of the Passing of the First-Born," which is like a lyrical poem, you cannot but be moved. All parents in the world love their children, especially their firstborn. But a black father, for the death of his firstborn, "felt a certain nameless satisfaction." If you blame him for not having a father's love, then you are wrong; his love for his son is deep, but in the dark world of racial discrimination, how can a black father protect a black child from torment and harm? Not to be suffocated and wither? Therefore, he quietly said to himself, "He has not failed, he has not failed, he has escaped; not in the wearing of fetters, but free." This is not only a father's sorrow, but a nation's sorrow! With equally touching strokes, the author writes in "Of the Coming of John" through the story of a young black farmer seeking education and returning home, the tragic encounters of black people under racial discrimination and the gradual awakening of black people.
    Du Bois's work is inseparable from his own six or seventy years of struggle for the liberation of African Americans. At the beginning of the twentieth century, he and a group of American radical black intellectuals centered on the "Boston Guardian" jointly launched the famous "Niagara Movement" to oppose the capitulationist line in the black liberation movement at that time, demanding that black people enjoy the civil and social rights due to free people. "The Souls of Black Folk" can be said to be the banner of this movement. Therefore, after its publication, it was not only immediately valued and loved by readers, becoming the declaration of the newly emerging trend of the American black liberation movement at that time, but also has occupied an important position in black progressive literature for decades.
    Of course, because this book was written in the early twentieth century, and Du Bois, as he himself said in the "Preface to the Chinese Translation," was not yet "a socialist and knew little about communism" at that time, the book inevitably has some limitations and some incorrect views, and these views can no longer represent the author's later thoughts. For example, the book believes that education can overcome racial prejudice and enable black people to achieve liberation, and that black people's small-scale peasant economy is a way to prevent the evils of capitalism.
    Du Bois was a man of many talents. His literary works are as rich as his historical and social science works. He not only wrote essays, but also poems and novels. After completing "The Souls of Black Folk," he had already traveled a long road in his creation. He has stated more than once on different occasions and in different works that the struggle of black people for freedom and rights, and the struggle of the American people to defend world peace, can only be guaranteed final victory through close cooperation with the proletariat and under the leadership of the Communist Party. Recently, he was awarded the Lenin Prize for Strengthening International Peace for his contribution to the cause of world peace. All of this shows that the entire black liberation movement is constantly advancing, and Du Bois is also constantly advancing.

### 黑人的心声——读“黑人的灵魂”

    黑人的心声
    ——读“黑人的灵魂”
    黄星圻
    最近由人民文学出版社出版的
  “黑人的灵魂”，是卓越的美国黑人和平战士杜波伊斯的散文集。这部作品虽然写于五十多年以前，但它在今天，仍有着深刻的现实意义。那时笼罩在美国黑人头上的阴云——种族歧视，今天并未散去，黑人的悲惨生活和发自灵魂深处的悲歌仍在美国上空回旋。这部作品以强大的力量打动读者的心。
    收在这本富于诗意和想像的文集里的，一共是十四篇散文、随笔和小说。然而，作者却用一根线，很巧妙地把它们结成了一个有机的整体，使它们成为一部完整的具有独特风格的作品。这根线就是世世代代美国黑人要求解放的强烈愿望，以及他们为了实现这一愿望而进行的不屈不挠的斗争。在全书的每一章前面，作者都附了一节黑人的悲歌。当我们一篇篇读下去的时候，我们自始至终都沉浸在激昂的悲歌里。
    作者首先把我们带到十九世纪美国南北战争后的一段时期。这是一场有名无实的“解放黑奴”的战争，黑人并没有从这里获得真正解放。作者怀着沉痛的心情，以诗意的笔触，叙述了美国黑人从南北战争结束到十九世纪末这一阶段的经历，描写了住在所谓“黑人地带”的几百万黑人所受的奴役，以及他们在经济、教育、宗教等方面所遇到的许多问题，明确地反对了当时黑人解放运动中的布克·华盛顿的投降主义。
    作者根据实地调查和看到的事实，指出奴隶制度对黑人说来是一切痛苦的根源，但是黑人脱除奴隶制度的结果，并没有跳出贫穷和灾难的深渊，他们既没有土地，也没有权利，他们仍处在奴隶地位。他指出：南北战争以后，原来是农业地区的美国南部，开始沿着资本主义道路发展，地主让位于资本家，资本家办了纺织工业，同时也取得了棉花生产的管理权，没有土地的黑人脱出了奴隶的枷锁，又落入了这些资本家的虎口。作者把事实、论点、诗情和想像融而为一，我们读着他所描绘的当时美国南部黑人的贫困、凄凉的图景，不啻是重温了一遍十九世纪末和二十世纪初的美国南部历史。
    除去写黑人的一般处境外，这本书还深入地谈到了当时美国黑人知识分子的遭遇。作者在许多篇章里，不仅描写了美国黑人知识分子在种族歧视和压迫下所作的种种艰苦奋斗，同时也深入地刻画了他们的惨痛经历。在作者的笔下，我们可以看到至今种族歧视是怎样地在限制、压迫和摧残着美国的黑人。种族歧视剥夺了黑人生活的种种权利，并同样把阴影投到了黑人孩子们的身上。如果他们想在白人和黑人之间跨越一步，他们就会受到严厉的打击，甚至丧失生命。作者在这些方面的描写，是真实、深刻而感动人的。当我们读着像“头生子的夭折”这样的抒情诗一样的散文时，你不能不激动。普天下的父母，谁不爱自己的孩子，更何况又是头生。但一个黑人父亲，却为他的头生子的死，
  “心里洋溢着一种无法形容的快乐”。如果你责备他没有父亲的爱，那就错了；他爱子的心是深沉的，但在种族歧视的阴暗世界里，一个黑人父亲怎能保护一个黑孩子不受折磨和残害？不被窒息和雕零？因此，他悄悄对自己说：“没有死，没有死，是逃掉了；不是套上了枷锁，而是获得自由了。”这不仅是一个父亲的悲恸，而是一个民族的悲恸！作者以同样感人的笔触，在
  “约翰的归来”里，通过一个黑人青年农民求学、回家的故事，写出了黑人在种族歧视下的悲惨遭遇和黑人的逐渐觉醒。
    杜波伊斯的作品，和他本人六、七十年来为美国黑人解放所作的斗争是分不开的。二十世纪初，他曾经和一批以“波士顿前卫报”为中心的美国急进黑人知识分子，联合发起有名的“尼亚拉加运动”，反对当时黑人解放运动中的投降路线，要求黑人享有自由人应有的公民权利和社会权利。“黑人的灵魂”这本书，可以说正是这一运动的旗帜。因此，它出版后不但立即受到读者的重视和喜爱，成为当时刚刚兴起的美国黑人解放运动的新潮流的宣言，而且几十年来在黑人进步文学中一直占着重要的地位。
    当然，由于这本书写在二十世纪初年，而杜波伊斯又像他自己在
  “中译本序”中所说，在当时还“不是一个社会主义者，对共产主义更所知无多”，所以书中不可避免地有一些带有局限性和一些不正确的观点，这些观点已经不能代表作者以后的思想。比如，书中认为教育可以克服种族偏见而使黑人获得解放，黑人的小农经济是防止资本主义罪恶的办法等。
    杜波伊斯是个具有多方面才能的人，他的文学著作与他的历史和社会科学著作同样丰富，他不仅写散文，也写诗和小说。在完成“黑人的灵魂”以后，他在创作上已经走过了一段很长的道路。他曾经在不同的场合和不同的作品里，不只一次表示：黑人争取自由权利的斗争，美国人民保卫世界和平的斗争，只有同无产阶级密切合作，并在共产党的领导下才能保证最后胜利。最近，由于他为世界和平事业所作的贡献，他荣获了加强国际和平列宁奖金。这一切都说明整个黑人解放运动在不断前进，杜波伊斯也在不断前进。
