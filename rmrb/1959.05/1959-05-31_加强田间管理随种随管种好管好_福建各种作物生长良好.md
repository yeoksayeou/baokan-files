    Strengthen Field Management, Plant and Manage Simultaneously, Plant Well and Manage Well
    Fujian's Various Crops Are Growing Well

    (Reported by this newspaper) The spring sowing and planting in Fujian Province have basically concluded. Ten million mu of double-cropping early rice, peanuts, sugarcane, soybeans, and other crops are growing lush and strong. In the southern Fujian region, early rice, peanuts, and soybeans have already begun to head or blossom and set pods. Currently, under the slogan of "plant and manage simultaneously, plant well and manage well," various localities are continuing to accumulate and apply fertilizer, vigorously engaging in mid-tillage and weeding, strengthening field management such as drainage and irrigation, and pest control, striving in every possible way to achieve a bumper summer harvest. Over 7.3 million mu of early rice in the province have mostly undergone mid-tillage and fertilization once or twice. Most economic crops such as peanuts, soybeans, and sugarcane have also achieved no missing seedlings, no fertilizer deficiency, and no weeds.

    This year's spring sowing and planting production in Fujian Province has been carried out on the basis of the rich experience gained from last year's Great Leap Forward. The planting of various crops has generally started earlier and been done better than last year. Most of the spring sowing and planting fields have been deeply ploughed two to five inches deeper than last year. Irrigation equipment has also increased compared to last year. The planting density of various crops has mostly reached the requirements of rational close planting, and field management has been strengthened. Therefore, most crops are growing with uniform seedlings, thick stalks, and lush leaves.

    In order to further promote the vigorous growth of various crops and ensure a large-scale bumper harvest in the summer, various localities in Fujian attach particular importance to strengthening field management. In addition to implementing the principle of managing each plot as it is planted, many regions, based on the characteristics of this year's early planting season and large climate changes, as well as the large amount of japonica rice and direct-seeded rice, have universally implemented field management methods that are in accordance with the time (depending on the season), the weather (depending on the weather), the location (depending on the fertility of the fields), the variety (depending on the variety), and the seedlings (depending on the growth of the seedlings). Based on the characteristics of various rice varieties and the objective conditions of planting time, growth conditions, and climate change, they are promptly carrying out mid-tillage, topdressing, drainage, and irrigation, striving to ensure the uniform and vigorous growth of various early rice varieties. Production teams of people's communes in various localities have also universally established field management organizations and systems that combine specialized teams with mass campaigns. All fields are divided into plots and assigned to field managers (or groups), who are responsible for managing them to the end. Incentive systems have also been implemented, greatly enhancing the responsibility and enthusiasm of commune members. After mass field inspections, evaluations, and the establishment of regular field management systems in the Longxi Special District, most of the 1.44 million mu of early rice have met the requirements of no fertilizer deficiency, no missing seedlings, no water shortage, and no pests. After careful inspection and identification, Changle County found that more than 25,000 mu of fertilizer-deficient fields had uneven and weak seedlings. They immediately organized a topdressing shock team of more than 17,000 people, applying 15 to 20 dan of topdressing fertilizer per mu according to different fertilizer deficiency situations, which immediately reduced the county's third-class seedlings from 15% to only 2%. After meticulously processing and applying fertilizer and carefully managing the fields, the people's communes in Zhangpu County, combining specialized management with mass campaigns, organized 100,000 male and female commune members to continuously engage in processing fertilizer and careful management. Within ten days, the county's 200,000 mu of early rice first-class fields increased from 30% to over 50%, second-class fields decreased from 47% to 40%, and third-class fields decreased from 23% to only 10%.

### 加强田间管理随种随管种好管好  福建各种作物生长良好

    加强田间管理随种随管种好管好
    福建各种作物生长良好
    本报讯　福建省春播春种已基本结束，一千万亩双季早稻、花生、甘蔗、大豆等作物，长得青葱茁壮，十分旺盛。闽南地区的早稻、花生和大豆已经开始抽穗或开花结荚。现在各地正在“随种随管、种好管好”的口号下，继续积肥、追肥，大搞中耕除草，加强排水灌水和防治虫害等田间管理工作，千方百计争取夏季大丰收。全省七百三十多亩早稻，已大部中耕和追肥一次到二次，花生、大豆、甘蔗等经济作物大部分也作到不缺苗、不缺肥、没杂草。
    今年福建省春播春种生产是在有了去年大跃进丰富经验的基础上开展的，各种作物种植工作一般都比去年动手早、种得好。春播春种田地大部分比去年深耕二至五寸，水利设备也比去年增加，各种农作物的密植程度大都达到合理密植要求，并加强了田间管理，因此各种作物大多长得苗齐秆粗叶肥。
    为了进一步促进各种作物茁壮生长，确保夏季大面积丰产，福建各地都特别重视加强田间管理工作。许多地区除了实行种一丘管一丘外，还根据今年种植季节较早气候变化较大、粳稻和直播水稻较多等特点，普遍实行了因时（看季节）、因天（看天气）、因地（看田地肥瘦）、因种（看品种）、因苗（看禾苗生长情况）的田间管理方法，根据各种品种水稻的特性和种植迟早、生长情况、气候变化等客观条件，及时中耕追肥和排水、灌水、力争各种品种的早稻生长整齐繁茂。各地人民公社的生产队还普遍建立了专业队和群众性突击相结合的田间管理组织和制度，所有田地都划片包给田间管理员（或小组），由他们负责管理到底，并实行奖励制度，大大提高了社员的责任心和积极性。龙溪专区在经过群众性的田间检查评比和建立经常性田间管理制度后，一百四十四万多亩的早稻大部分达到不缺肥、不缺苗、不缺水、无虫害等要求。长乐县在经过细致的检查鉴定，发现有二万五千多亩缺肥田禾苗长得不够整齐茁壮以后，立即组织了一万七千多人的追肥突击队，根据不同缺肥情况，每亩多施追肥十五担到二十担，随即使全县三类苗由原来占15％减少到仅占2％。漳浦县各人民公社采用专业管理和群众性突击相结合，组织了十万名男女社员连续进行加工加肥和精心管理后，在十天中，全县二十万亩早稻的一类田即由原来占30％增加到占50％多，二类田则由原来占47％减少为占40％，三类田由占23％减少为仅占10％。
