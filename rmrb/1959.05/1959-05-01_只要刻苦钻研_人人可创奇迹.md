Last year, the workers of the Chongqing Construction Machine Tool Factory realized a million large and small technical innovation projects, an increase of eighty-six times over 1957. Not only was the quantity large, but the quality was also high, increasing work efficiency by several times, dozens of times, and some even by tens of thousands of times. Fellow representatives:
	I fully agree with the reports of Premier Zhou and several Vice Premiers, and I guarantee to bring the spirit of the conference back and resolutely and practically implement it.
	I am a young milling worker from the Chongqing Construction Machine Tool Factory. I feel very honored and excited to be able to attend this meeting. 1958 was a year of all-round great leap forward in all work, a year of victory, which has been recorded in the glorious history of the motherland as a magnificent poem. Now, please allow me to report to the conference on the situation of our factory's vigorous technical revolution.
	In 1958, all the workers of our factory, like workers all over the country, under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, implemented the Party's general line for socialist construction, broke down superstitions, liberated their minds, vigorously carried out technical revolution, promoted "two participations, one reform, and three combinations," followed the policy of "taking steel as the key link and making an all-round leap forward" and "combining indigenous and foreign methods," and enthusiastically launched production competitions. All the workers in the factory revised the leap forward plan three times and launched one high-yield and high-quality movement after another. They successfully trial-produced 53 kinds of new products and achieved a great victory in the great leap forward. They overfulfilled the state's ever-increasing production tasks, and the commodity output value completed 102.08% of the leap forward plan.
	The results of the vigorous technical revolution last year vividly proved that technical revolution and invention are not so mysterious and unattainable. As long as we follow Chairman Mao's instructions: "Break down superstitions, liberate our minds, and everything goes through experimentation," carry forward the communist style of daring to speak, daring to think, and daring to act, and create miracles through practical, hard, clever work, and diligent study. In the past year, all the workers in the factory have realized a million large and small technical innovation projects, an increase of eighty-six times over 1957. Not only is the quantity large, but the quality is also high, increasing work efficiency by several times, dozens of times, and some even by tens of thousands of times. For example, the innovation proposal of multi-machine management of eight to sixteen machines by one person created by me and Comrade Liu Maojue is one example. Especially after the enlarged meeting of the Political Bureau of the Party Central Committee (Beidaihe), all the workers in the factory enthusiastically responded to the Party's call for fighting for steel with steel as the key link, launched a great competition for double high yield and double leap forward, and some comrades directly devoted themselves to the steelmaking movement. In just a few days, hundreds of indigenous steelmaking furnaces were built, and they fought day and night, sleeplessly, beside the steelmaking furnaces, racing against time for steel; some comrades undertook the task of creating large-scale equipment. In the absence of equipment and technical strength, the comrades exerted their soaring revolutionary vigor and infinite wisdom, and self-made and modified large-scale planers, forging hammers, boring machines and other equipment combining indigenous and foreign methods. These amazing creations not only guaranteed the completion of the annual leap forward plan and produced more than 800 sets of large and medium-sized machine tool equipment such as generators and radial drills, changing the situation in our factory that has always produced single small products, but also created conditions for a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward this year, laying a higher starting point.
	1959 is the second year of the second five-year plan. According to the spirit of the Resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party and the instructions of the Provincial Party Committee, all the workers in the factory continued to vigorously carry out technical revolution at the beginning of this year. I and all the workers together, in the first quarter, I put forward and implemented more than 60 major technical innovation proposals, the highest of which increased work efficiency by 28,960 times, and generally increased work efficiency by several times, dozens of times. Calculated only on the basis of 56 of them, it can save the country more than 102,000 yuan in materials, equipment, and labor costs. This year, the leap forward plan has been revised five times in a row, and each time it is more advanced than the previous one, and the number of technical innovation proposals to be realized is doubled compared with last year. For example, the turret disc parts on a certain car motor frame were originally processed on a car, which took a long time, and there was a shortage of cars. Master Huang Yuancheng in our work area changed it to milling machine processing. Although the difficulty of insufficient cars was solved, the processing time was still long. With the help of comrades, especially Comrade Deng Wenjin, I succeeded in experimenting with installing three knives instead of one, and originally only one turret wheel could be processed per shift. After the reform, it was shortened to three minutes to process one, increasing the output by 160 times, and the quality was completely qualified.
	Since the beginning of this year, in the case of a shortage of raw materials, the whole factory has launched a "clever tailor" competition, trying every means to save raw materials and find substitutes. In the first quarter alone, 465 tons of steel were saved. In order to improve labor productivity, we also launched the "thousand minutes," "thousand hours," and "clever girl" competitions, carried out mass movements on a large scale, and strived to increase production. In the competition, 367 female workers won the glorious title of clever girl. For example, the clever girl group in Workshop 25 of our factory, with a total of 27 people, completed 15 months of work in three months and five days by April 5. In the past three months, the whole group has basically overfulfilled the plan every day and increased production every month. They have realized more than 4,300 innovation proposals, large and small, including 434 important ones. At the same time, they have also implemented multi-tool, multi-blade, and multi-clamp workpiece methods on all lathes, so that one machine tool can be used as several machine tools.
	At present, all the workers in the factory are full of enthusiasm and high morale, and are continuing to move forward under the slogan of "learning from each other, watching each other, and striving to be red flag shock troops in the great production competition." At the beginning of March this year, the Provincial and Municipal Party Committees decided to expand Chongqing Iron and Steel, increase steel production capacity, and assign part of the manufacturing task of the 150-ton open hearth furnace equipment to our factory. The vast number of workers were even more high-spirited and fighting spirit, and expressed to the Party that they would resolutely complete the task ahead of schedule, ensure that steel would be produced on "July 1" to welcome the Party's birthday, and carry out a "one-stop" great cooperation competition. In less than half a month, they completed 27.15% of the tasks they undertook. Thanks to the leadership of the Party and the efforts of the workers, we have now successfully completed the "six guarantees" tasks given to us by the central and provincial and municipal governments in the first quarter, and fired the first shot of 1959.
	1959 is a year of greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward. All the workers in the factory are determined to strive for greater victories on the basis of victory in accordance with the principle of "the whole country is one game of chess." At present, we must first ensure that we overfulfill the leap forward plan for April and the second quarter, "Guarantee the second quarter with April, and guarantee the whole year with the second quarter" is our action slogan.
	Our achievements are mainly due to the correct leadership of the Party, and every comrade has given full play to their high degree of enthusiasm and creativity. However, there are still many problems now, such as many varieties, high precision requirements, and many technical difficulties. We must continue to liberate our minds, vigorously carry out technical revolution, carry forward the spirit of daring to think and daring to act, and try every means to find a way to ensure that we overcome this difficulty.
	October 1 this year is the glorious festival of the tenth anniversary of the founding of New China. All the workers in our factory are determined to earnestly implement the spirit of the Seventh Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, actively carry out a vigorous campaign to increase production and practice economy, and use the practical actions of completing and overfulfilling the 1959 leap forward plan to create greater achievements to welcome the tenth anniversary of the National Day, strive to go to Beijing to report our work to our beloved leader Chairman Mao at the National Conference of Advanced Collectives and Advanced Producers.
	If there is anything wrong with the above speech, please give your opinions.
	Finally, I wish the representatives good health.

    只要刻苦钻研　人人可创奇迹
    廖世刚代表的发言
    去年一年，重庆建设机床厂职工，实现大小技术革新项目达百万件，比一九五七年增长了八十六倍，不仅数量多，而且质量高，提高工效几倍、几十倍，有的甚至达万倍以上。各位代表：
    我完全同意周总理及几位副总理的报告，并保证把大会精神带回去，坚决的切实地加以贯彻执行。
    我是重庆建设机床厂的一个青年铣工，我能够出席这次会议感到非常光荣、兴奋。一九五八年是各项工作全面大跃进的一年，是胜利的一年，它已经作为壮丽的诗篇载入了祖国光荣的史册。现在请允许我把我们工厂大闹技术革命的情况向大会作一汇报。
    一九五八年我们厂的全体职工，同全国各地职工一样，在党中央和毛主席的英明领导下，贯彻执行党的社会主义建设总路线，破除迷信，解放思想，大闹技术革命，推行“两参一改三结合”，遵循着“以钢为纲，全面跃进”以及
  “土洋结合”的方针，热火朝天地开展生产竞赛，全厂职工三番五次修订跃进计划，掀起了一个又一个的高产优质运动，试制成功了五十三种新产品，取得了大跃进的伟大胜利，超额完成了国家给予我们一次比一次更大的生产任务，商品产值完成了跃进计划百分之一百零二点零八。
    去年大闹技术革命的结果，生动地证明技术革命和创造发明并不是那么神秘，高不可攀的，只要遵循着毛主席所提出的：“破除迷信，解放思想，一切经过试验”的指示，发扬敢说、敢想、敢干的共产主义风格，经过实干苦干巧干和刻苦钻研则人人可创奇迹。一年来，全厂职工实现大小技术革新项目达百万件，比一九五七年增长了八十六倍，不仅数量多，而且质量高，提高工效几倍、几十倍，有的甚至达万倍以上。如我和刘茂爵同志创造的一人看八台至十六台的多机床管理的革新建议就是一例证。特别是在党中央政治局（北戴河）扩大会议以后，全厂职工热烈地响应了党所提出的以钢为纲、为钢而战的战斗号召，开展了双高产、双跃进的大竞赛，一部分同志直接投入了炼钢运动，仅几天时间，建立起了几百个土炼钢炉，并夜以继日，不眠不休地战斗在炼钢炉旁，向时间争夺钢铁；一部分同志承担了创造大型设备的任务，在缺乏设备、缺乏技术力量的情况下，同志们发挥了冲天的革命干劲和无穷的智慧，自制和改装成功土洋结合的大型刨床、锻锤、搪床等设备，这些惊人的创造，不仅保证了全年跃进计划的完成，生产了发电机、摇臂钻等八百余台大中型机床设备，改变了我厂一向生产单一小型产品的局面，而且为今年更大更好更全面的跃进创造了条件，奠定了更高的起脚点。
    一九五九年是第二个五年计划的第二年。根据党的八届六中全会决议精神和省委指示，全厂职工在今年一开始就继续大闹技术革命，我和全厂职工在一起，在第一季度，我提出和实现了六十多项重大技术革新建议，其中最高的提高工效两万八千九百六十倍，一般都提高工效几倍、几十倍，仅就其中五十六项计算，就可以为国家节约材料、设备人工等费用十万二千多元。今年一连五次修改跃进计划，一次比一次更先进，要比去年实现的技术革新建议增加两倍。例如，有一种元车马达架上的宝塔盘零件，原来是在元车上加工，加工时间长，同时又缺乏元车，我们工区黄元成老师傅改为铣床加工，虽然解决了元车不足的困难，但加工时间还是长，在同志们的帮助下，特别是邓文金同志几次帮助下我试验成功了由原来安装一把刀子，后改进为安装三把刀子，原来每班只能加工一个宝塔轮，后来经过改革就缩短为三分钟加工一个，提高产量一百六十倍，质量完全合格。
    今年以来，在原材料缺乏的情况下，全厂开展“巧裁缝”竞赛，千方百计地节约原材料，找代用料等，仅一季度即节约钢材四百六十五吨。为了提高劳动生产率，我们又开展了“千分钟”“千台时”以及“巧姑娘”竞赛，大搞群众运动，争取生产加番；在竞赛中，有三百六十七个女工取得了巧姑娘的光荣称号。例如我厂二十五车间巧姑娘小组，全组二十七人，到四月五日止，用三个月零五天的时间，就完成了十五个月的工作量。三个多月来，全组基本上做到天天超额完成计划，月月生产加番，他们已经实现了革新建议大大小小四千三百多项，其中重要的有四百三十四项，同时，他们还在全部车床上实行多刀、多刃和多夹工件的办法，这样，一部机床就能顶几部机床用。
    目前，全厂职工情绪饱满，干劲很高，正在“互相学习，互相观摩，在生产大竞赛中争取作红旗突击手”的口号下继续奋勇前进。今年三月初，省市委决定扩建重钢，增加钢铁生产能力，并把一百五十吨的平炉设备的部分制造任务分配我厂以后，广大职工更是意气风发，斗志昂扬，纷纷向党表示坚决提前完成任务，保证“七一”出钢，迎接党的生日，开展“一条龙”的大协作竞赛，不到半月时间，就完成所承担任务的百分之二十七点一五，由于党的领导，职工的努力，现在已经胜利地完成了一季度中央和省市给予我们的“六保”任务，打响了一九五九年的第一炮。
    一九五九年是更大、更好、更全面跃进的一年，全厂职工决心在胜利的基础上按照“全国一盘棋”的方针，争取更大的胜利，当前首先保证超额完成四月份和二季度的跃进计划，
  “四月保二季，二季保全年”这是我们的行动口号。
    我们获得上述成绩，主要是党的正确领导，每个同志都发挥了高度的积极性和创造性。但现在存在的问题还是较多的，比如品种多，要求精密，技术上困难多，我们必须继续解放思想，大闹技术革命，发扬敢想敢作精神，千方百计想办法，保证过好这一关。
    今年十月一日是新中国建国十周年的光荣节日，我们全厂职工坚决在党中央和毛主席的领导下，认真贯彻党的八届七中全会精神，积极开展轰轰烈烈的增产节约运动，用完成和超额完成一九五九年跃进计划的实际行动，创造更大的成绩来迎接国庆十周年大庆，争取上北京在全国先进集体和先进生产者代表会议上，向我们敬爱的领袖毛主席汇报我们的工作。
    以上发言，有不对的地方，请代表们提出意见。
    最后，祝代表们身体健康。
