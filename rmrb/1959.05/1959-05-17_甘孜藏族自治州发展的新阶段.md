    A New Stage of Development in the Ganzi Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture
    Shana (Tibetan), Governor of Ganzi Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture and Secretary of the CPC Ganzi Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture Committee
    In the past three years, the Ganzi Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture has experienced a revolution of great historical significance. That is, in the vast rural areas and pastures of the entire prefecture, the task of democratic reform has been basically completed, and the feudal serf system has been completely destroyed. This reform began in batches in 1956, and was basically completed in all agricultural areas and some pastoral areas by the end of last year. After the democratic reform, the mutual aid and cooperation movement has flourished, and the autonomous prefecture presents an unprecedentedly prosperous scene.
    This is a continuation of the great people's revolution around 1949 and a brilliant victory for the Party's ethnic policy. From now on, the people of all ethnic groups in the entire autonomous prefecture, mainly Tibetans, have embarked on a new stage of development: a stage of fully launching socialist transformation and rapidly advancing towards socialism. The completion of the democratic reform has fundamentally changed the old, feudal relations of production in the Ganzi Tibetan region, and liberated the productive forces that have been bound and suppressed for thousands of years. This undoubtedly has great historical significance for the development of agricultural and pastoral production in the autonomous prefecture, accelerating socialist construction, and carrying out the technical and cultural revolutions. The backwardness of the autonomous prefecture will be rapidly changed. The people of the autonomous prefecture will join the people of all fraternal ethnic groups across the country to make more contributions to building our great socialist motherland.
    For thousands of years, the reactionary, dark, cruel, and barbaric serf system weighed on the heads of the people of the autonomous prefecture like a mountain, and the broad masses of working people lived extremely miserable lives. People for generations cultivated land, performed services, paid taxes, and went to war for the serf owners without compensation; suffered from the cruel exploitation of high-interest loans where borrowing three required repayment of four, borrowing two required repayment of three, or even borrowing one required repayment of two, which could not be repaid for generations; and groaned under the cruel punishments such as gouging out eyes, cutting off limbs, and extracting hearts, as well as the whips of the serf owners. Production stagnated at the low level of "slash-and-burn" agriculture. After liberation, the People's Government organized the masses to reclaim wasteland, and vigorously led the masses to develop production by distributing agricultural tools and various relief grain and funds, carrying out ethnic trade, cultural, educational, health, and veterinary disease prevention work, and increasing people's income, which to a certain extent improved the lives of the masses. However, since the social system had not changed, the suffering of the masses was not fundamentally relieved. Therefore, incidents of the people spontaneously rising up to fight against the feudal lords increased day by day. Some were quite large in scale, such as the 1,200 households in three districts of Batang County who resisted rent and debt. Many people signed and stamped their names to the People's Government requesting reform. Under this situation, the demand for reform has become an unstoppable tide of anger. The CPC Ganzi Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture Committee and the Autonomous Prefecture People's Committee accepted the demands of the masses, and after full consultation with upper-level figures and obtaining their consent, carried out democratic reform in batches throughout the prefecture from 1956 under the principle of "mobilizing the masses and consulting with the upper levels."
    However, a few extremely reactionary upper-level figures wanted to maintain their dark rule forever. Under the planning and command of the reactionary group in the upper echelons of Tibet, colluding with imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, they raised the banners of "defending the nation" and "protecting religion," and launched a counter-revolutionary rebellion in an attempt to prevent the Tibetan people from moving forward. They coerced some of the masses to go to the mountains, attacked government agencies, massacred the masses, raped and plundered, and committed all kinds of evil deeds. Facts have proved that it was they who violated the will of their own people and were therefore spurned by the Tibetan people. With the counterattack of the broad masses and the support of the People's Liberation Army, they quickly suffered a shameful defeat.
    Through democratic reform, the Tibetan people and other ethnic groups in the autonomous prefecture have gained complete liberation. In the countryside, 70% of the farmers have been allocated land, with poor and hired peasants receiving an average of about four mu of cultivated land per person; 80% of the farmers have been liberated from the exploitation of high-interest loans; and about 5,000 households of slaves who had no personal freedom have begun a free new life. In the reform, more than 80% of adults participated in peasant associations and herdsmen associations; tens of thousands of farmers and herdsmen organized their own armed forces, trained and emerged tens of thousands of activists. Many advanced elements joined the Communist Party of China and the Communist Youth League.
    Through democratic reform, the people of the autonomous prefecture have more deeply felt the greatness of the Party and Chairman Mao and their care for the working masses. The ethnic hatred and prejudice created by the feudal ruling class has been swept away. Ethnic relations have undergone fundamental changes. The Han people and the Tibetan people have formed a friendship deeper than the sea in the reform. People expressed all this by actively responding to the Party's call and enthusiastic praise, and by the actions of great collaboration and unity among ethnic groups. The liberated people, with amazing enthusiasm and drive, launched a production upsurge. In 1957, the areas that had completed the democratic reform achieved the largest harvest in history. Last year, people overcame the drought, which had not been seen in 20 years, and increased grain production in the prefecture by more than 19%. In 1956, the first batch of agricultural production cooperatives appeared in the prefecture. By last year, 30% of the households had joined the cooperatives. This spring, the number of households that have joined cooperatives has reached 63% of the total number of households, and a number of pastoral production cooperatives have been established. Many agricultural cooperatives have surpassed the production and income levels of local wealthy peasants in one or two years. Cooperativization has demonstrated great superiority. The broad masses of cadres have accumulated rich experience in running cooperatives.
    In line with the principle of "active leadership and steady progress," the prefecture plans this year: to basically achieve advanced cooperativization in the areas where primary agricultural cooperativization has been basically achieved after the autumn harvest; and to basically achieve primary cooperativization in the remaining areas before and after the autumn harvest; and to strive to basically achieve advanced agricultural cooperativization throughout the prefecture this winter and next spring; and to vigorously establish primary cooperatives in pastoral areas. Transportation, postal and telecommunications, culture and education, health, commerce, and other undertakings are all required to have considerable development, and efforts will be made to achieve an all-round great leap forward.
  Under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao and the brilliant illumination of the general line of socialist construction, coupled with the support of fraternal ethnic groups across the country, and the urgent demand and soaring enthusiasm of the more than 500,000 people of all ethnic groups, mainly Tibetans, to build socialism, we are fully confident that in a not too long period of time, we will completely change the backwardness of the autonomous prefecture.

    甘孜藏族自治州发展的新阶段
    甘孜藏族自治州州长  中共甘孜藏族自治州委员会书记  沙纳（藏族）
    在过去三年中，甘孜藏族自治州经历了一场具有伟大历史意义的革命。这就是，在全州辽阔的农村和牧场，基本上完成了民主改革的任务，彻底摧毁了封建农奴制度。这次改革是从1956年开始分批进行的，到去年底，才在全部农业区和部分牧区基本结束。民主改革后，互助合作运动蓬勃发展，自治州呈现一片从未有过的欣欣向荣的景象。
    这是1949年前后人民大革命的继续，是党的民族政策的光辉胜利。全自治州以藏族为主的各族人民，从此走上了一个新的发展阶段：全面展开社会主义改造，飞速向社会主义跃进的阶段。民主改革的完成，使甘孜藏族地区根本改变了旧的、封建的生产关系，解放了千百年来被束缚和压抑的生产力。这对自治州农牧业生产的发展，加快社会主义建设，开展技术革命和文化革命，无疑地具有伟大的历史意义，自治州的落后面貌将会迅速改变。自治州人民将和全国各兄弟民族人民一道，为建设我们伟大的社会主义祖国作出更多贡献。
    千百年来，反动的、黑暗的、残酷的、野蛮的农奴制度，像大山一样压在自治州人民的头上，广大劳动人民群众过着极为悲惨的生活。人们世世代代无代价地为农奴主种地、服役、纳税、出征；遭受着借三还四，借二还三，甚至借一还二，几代无法还清的高利贷的残酷剥削；呻吟在农奴主们挖眼、削肢、掏心等残忍的刑罚和皮鞭之下。生产长期停滞在“刀耕火种”的低下水平。解放后，人民政府在这个地区曾经组织群众开荒，也曾经以发放农具和各种救济粮、款的方式大力领导群众发展生产，开展民族贸易、文教卫生以及兽疫防治等事业，增加人民的收入，这在一定程度上使群众生活有了改善。但是，由于社会制度没有改变，群众的痛苦并没有根本解除，因此，人民自发地起来与封建主斗争的事件日益增多。有的规模相当大，如巴塘县的三个区曾有一千二百多户群众抗租、抗债。许多群众签名盖章向人民政府提出改革的要求。在这种形势下，要求改革已成为不可遏止的怒潮。中共甘孜藏族自治州委员会和自治州人民委员会接受了群众的要求，在和上层人士进行充分的协商，取得了他们的同意后。在“发动群众、上层协商”的方针下，从1956年起，在全州分批地进行了民主改革。
    但是，少数极端反动的上层分子却想永远保持他们黑暗的统治。他们在西藏上层反动集团的策划和指挥下，勾结帝国主义和蒋介石匪帮，打起“保卫民族”和“保护宗教”的旗帜，掀起了反革命叛乱，企图阻止藏族人民前进。他们胁迫部分群众上山，袭击政府机关，残杀群众，奸淫掳掠，无所不为。事实证明，正是他们违反了本民族的意愿，从而受到藏族人民的唾弃。在广大群众的反击和人民解放军的支援下，他们很快的就遭到了可耻的失败。
    经过民主改革，自治州藏族和其他各族人民获得了彻底解放。在农村中，有70％的农户分得了土地，贫雇农每人平均分得四亩左右的耕地；有80％的农户从高利贷的盘剥下解放了出来；约有五千户毫无人身自由的奴隶开始了自由的新生活。在改革中，有占成年人80％以上的人参加了农民协会和牧民协会；数以万计的农牧民组织了人民自己的武装，锻炼和涌现了成千上万的积极分子。许多先进分子加入了中国共产党和共产主义青年团。
    通过民主改革，自治州人民从切身感受中更加体会到党和毛主席的伟大和对劳动群众的关怀。封建统治阶级所造成的民族间的仇视与偏见一扫而光。民族关系起了根本变化。汉族人民和藏族人民在改革中结成了比大海还深的友谊。人们用积极响应党的号召和热情的歌颂，用民族间的大协作和团结的行动来表达这一切。解放了的人民，用惊人的热情和干劲，掀起了生产热潮。1957年，完成民主改革的地区就获得了历年来最大的丰收。去年，人们又战胜了二十年来未有的干旱，使全州增产粮食19％多。在1956年，全州出现的第一批农业生产合作社，到去年，占农户总数30％的人家都入了社，今年春季入社农户已占农户总数的63％，并建立了一批牧业生产合作社。许多农业社在一年或两年间就超过了当地富裕农民的生产和收入水平。合作化显示了巨大的优越性。广大干部积累了丰富的办社经验。
    本着“积极领导、稳步前进”的方针，今年全州计划：在已基本实现农业初级合作化的地区，秋后基本实现高级合作化；其余地区，秋收前后基本实现初级合作化；全州在今冬明春争取基本实现高级农业合作化；牧区大力建立初级社。交通、邮电、文教、卫生、商业等各项事业都要求有相当的发展，力争全面大跃进。
  在党中央和毛主席的英明领导和社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，加上全国兄弟民族的支援，和五十多万以藏族为主的各族人民的建设社会主义的迫切要求和冲天干劲，我们完全有信心在不长的时期内，彻底改变自治州的落后面貌。
