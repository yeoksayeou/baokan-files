    Farms in the Tarim River Basin
    Sow Seeds of a Bumper Harvest on Newly Reclaimed Land
    Planning to Produce Over 200 Million Jin of Grain, 280,000 Dan of Ginned Cotton, and Over 10 Million Jin of Oilseed This Year
    (Our Dispatch) The various farms in the upper and lower reaches of the Tarim River are now conducting their first spring sowing work in full swing on the vast newly reclaimed land. To ensure that the land they have personally reclaimed yields the greatest harvest this year, the soldiers and workers of each farm plan to sow 800,000 mu of land this year, producing 241 million jin of grain, 285,000 dan of ginned cotton, and over 11 million jin of oilseed for the state.
    In order to complete the spring sowing task on time and overfulfill this year's production plan, each farm has overcome many difficulties in spring sowing with soaring enthusiasm. To fertilize the newly reclaimed land, they launched a vigorous manure accumulation and fertilizer production campaign in January. After more than ten days of hard work, they accumulated and produced nearly 10 billion jin of fertilizer, bringing the average amount of fertilizer applied per mu to over 10,000 jin. In overcoming the shortage of agricultural machinery, each farm has promoted the spirit of communist cooperation. Before cooperation, the several farms of the Second Agricultural Division in the Tarim area were short of nearly 100 standard tractors, calculated according to previous operating quotas. However, after the farms cooperated, this difficulty was satisfactorily resolved. For example, at the cooperation meeting, a simple exchange of spare parts enabled twelve tractors that had been idle in the machine room to start running again. To overcome the lack of technical personnel in spring sowing, the farms also provided mutual support in terms of manpower. For example, farms with more experienced agricultural workers transferred some people to units with weaker technical strength. As a result, each farm's production team had technical backbones during spring sowing. To ensure the quality of spring sowing and create favorable conditions for mechanized farming, everyone also vigorously carried out land re-leveling work before and during spring sowing.
    In late February, when the land had just begun to thaw, a large-scale mass movement centered on spring sowing took shape in the farms. To sow the seeds of a bumper harvest quickly and well on the land they had personally reclaimed, the soldiers and workers could not wait for the land to thaw completely and began working enthusiastically. The soldiers and workers of the Fourth Tarim Farm used one point of time at noon every day to sow more than 7,000 mu of spring wheat before the land had completely thawed. To seize the sowing time, the vast majority of units held spring sowing mobilization rallies at the beginning of sowing, guaranteeing the early completion of spring sowing with the energy of a great leap forward in steel production. Many units set up spring sowing command posts in the fields to solve problems at any time. To rush to sow and plant, the soldiers and workers even moved their meals and sleep to the fields. Now, the farms have completed sowing more than 100,000 mu of spring wheat, and people are now carrying out the sowing of cotton, oilseed, and other crops. They plan to complete the sowing of 800,000 mu of land before mid-May.

    塔里木河流域各农场
    在新垦土地上播下丰收种籽
    今年计划生产二亿多斤粮食，二十八万多担皮棉和一千多万斤油料
    本报讯　塔里木河上下游地区的各个农场，在广阔的新垦土地上，现正热火朝天地进行着第一次春季播种工作。各农场的战士和职工们，为了使自己亲手开垦出来的土地在今年获得最大的丰收，他们计划在今年要播种的八十万亩土地上。给国家生产出二亿四千一百万斤粮食、二十八万五千担皮棉和一千一百多万斤油料。
    各农场为了及时地完成春播任务和超额完成今年的生产计划，都以冲天干劲克服了春播中的许多困难。为了给新垦土地施肥，他们在1月里就开展了轰轰烈烈的积肥、造肥运动，经过十多天的苦战，就积肥造肥近百亿斤，使每亩地的平均施肥量达到了一万斤以上。在克服农机具困难方面，各农场都发扬了共产主义的协作精神。农二师在塔里木地区的几个农场，在没有进行协作之前，按照往年作业定额计算，光拖拉机一项就缺少近一百个标准台，但各农场进行了协作之后，这个困难就得到了满意的解决。如在协作会上，大家仅在机件方面来了个互通有无，就使得十二台睡在机房里的机车重新转动起来。各农场为了克服春播中技术力量的不足，在人力方面也进行了互相支援，如一些老农工较多的场，就给一些技术力量薄弱的单位抽调了一部分人，这样做的结果，使各农场的生产队在春播中都有了技术骨干。各农场为了保证春播质量，并给机耕创造有利条件，大家在春播前和春播过程中，还大力进行了土地的复平工作。
    2月下旬，当土地刚刚开始解冻的时候，各农场以春播为中心的声势浩大的群众运动就形成了。战士和职工们为了在自己亲手开垦出来的土地上又快又好的播下丰收的种籽，他们等不得土地完全解冻，就热火朝天地干起来了。塔里木四场的战士和职工，利用每天中午的一点时间，在土地未完全消冻前，就播种了七千多亩春小麦，各农场为了争取播种时间，在播种开始的时候，绝大多数单位都举行了春播誓师大会，以大闹钢铁的干劲，保证春播提前完成。有许多单位在田野里设立了春播指挥部，做到了有问题随时解决。为了抢播抢种，战士和职工们，连吃饭、睡觉，也都搬到地里了。现在，各农场的十多万亩春小麦已经播完，人们又在进行着棉花、油料等作物的播种工作。他们计划在5月中旬以前，一定把八十万亩土地播完。
