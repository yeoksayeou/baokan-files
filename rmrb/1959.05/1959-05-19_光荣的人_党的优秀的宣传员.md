Glorious People

Outstanding Propagandist of the Party

Since the Great Leap Forward last year, in the Chengbei People's Commune of Bishan County, Sichuan, a young man without arms has often been seen carrying out various forms of propaganda activities in public canteens, fields, farmlands, and roadsides. This young man is Comrade Huang Chuanren, a disabled revolutionary soldier who was wounded in the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea.

In 1953, during the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea, Comrade Huang Chuanren unfortunately lost both arms, and also suffered serious injuries to his legs and abdomen. He was only twenty years old at the time. After the amputation of his arms, he felt pessimistic for a time. He thought, "Yesterday I was still a strong and lively young man, but today I am disabled, unable to work anymore, and adding a burden to the people. How painful this is!" But under the education and cultivation of the Party, and with the help of the nurses in the hospital, he read comic books such as "Three Warriors," "The Legless Flying General," "An Ordinary Soldier," and "How Steel Was Tempered." These heroic deeds deeply moved him, strengthened him, and enabled him to learn the skills to serve the people anew.

Through diligent study and hard practice, he finally learned to write with his mouth. He wrote a poem to the Party, requesting to return to his hometown to participate in socialist construction.

"Dear Party,

I am a soldier you personally cultivated,

You are my mother,

Although I have lost my arms,

I have a fiery heart,

To continue to shine for the motherland,

And dedicate my whole body and mind."

After Huang Chuanren returned to his hometown from the veterans' sanatorium, he was very excited to see the leap-forward development of the motherland's construction, so he actively participated in propaganda and mobilization work. When commune members were working, he composed clapper talks, mobilization poems, and jingles in the fields to encourage everyone to actively produce. He also went deep into production teams and groups to collect materials about good people and good deeds, write them into mobilization signs and insert them in the fields, or broadcast them through megaphones. He could not hold the megaphone, so he asked someone to tie the megaphone to a short tree branch for broadcasting. When mobile propaganda was needed, he tied the megaphone to his sleeve, and when he needed to broadcast, he bent down and used his mouth to hold the megaphone and placed it on a tree fork to support it for broadcasting. Sometimes he asked people to clip the newspaper and hang it on a tree branch, to read the newspaper to the commune members and publicize the Party's policies.

In order to improve the propaganda effect, he also learned to paint with his mouth. On the propaganda signs, he painted and wrote at the same time, sometimes using more than a dozen signs to put together a set of comic strips. He has now painted eleven wall paintings, thirty cartoons, more than two hundred mobilization signs, written more than five hundred mobilization poems, clapper poems and various slogans, and also compiled a cross-talk and collected more than four hundred and sixty folk songs. This year, he plans to write a thousand poems, draw a hundred paintings, and write two plays. (Fan Bingyi) (With picture)

### 光荣的人  党的优秀的宣传员

    光荣的人
    党的优秀的宣传员
    自去年大跃进以来，在四川璧山县城北人民公社里，经常可以看到有个失去了双臂的青年人，在公共食堂、地头、田间和路旁进行着各种形式的宣传活动。这位青年就是在抗美援朝战争中负伤的革命残废军人黄川仁同志。
    1953年，在抗美援朝战争中，黄川仁同志不幸失去了双臂，腿部腹部也受了重伤，那时他才二十岁。截去双臂以后，他一度感到悲观。他想：“昨天我还是个健壮活泼的小伙子，今天残废了，不能再工作了，还给人民增加负担，这多痛苦啊！”但是在党的教育和培养下，在医院护士同志们的帮助下，他看了“三勇士”、“无脚飞将军”、“普通一兵”、“钢铁是怎样炼成的”等连环画，这些英雄事迹，深深地感动了他，使他坚强起来，从新开始学习为人民服务的本领。
    经过勤学苦练，终于练成了用嘴写字。他向党写了一首诗，要求回乡参加社会主义建设。
    “亲爱的党，
    我是你亲手培养下的一名战士，
    你是我的母亲，
    我虽然失去了双臂，
    但我有颗火热的心，
    要为祖国继续放光，
    献出我全部身心。”
    黄川仁从荣军教养院回到家乡后，看到祖国建设飞跃地发展，心中非常激动，就积极参加了宣传鼓动工作。社员劳动时，他在田间编快板、鼓动诗、顺口溜等，鼓励大家积极生产。他还深入生产队、组，收集好人好事的材料，写成鼓动牌插在田间或用广播筒广播。他不能拿起广播筒，叫别人把广播筒拴在矮树枝上广播；需要流动宣传时，就把广播筒拴在衣袖上，要广播时弯腰用嘴把广播筒含起来，放在树叉上托着广播。有时叫人把报纸夹好，吊在树枝上，给社员读报宣传党的政策。
    为了提高宣传效果，他又学会了用嘴画画。在宣传牌上，一边画画，一边写字，有时用十几块牌子拼起来，画上一组连环画。他现在已画了墙画十一幅，漫画三十张，鼓动牌二百多块，写鼓动诗、快板诗和各种标语五百多件，还编相声一个，收集民歌四百六十多首。今年计划要写一千首诗，画一百张画，写两个剧本。　（樊炳义）（附图片）
