Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, May 20th: The Foreign Ministers' Conference continued on the 19th, chaired by U.S. Secretary of State Herter, to discuss the Soviet proposal for a peace treaty with Germany and the so-called "package plan" proposed by the U.S., British, and French delegations.

    French Foreign Minister Couve de Murville elaborated on the French delegation's position. He started by repeating old arguments, groundlessly claiming that the Soviet proposals for a peace treaty with Germany and a solution to the Berlin issue had created a "serious crisis" in Europe. He weakly attempted to prove that the Western countries' "package plan" was to accommodate the Soviet attitude and even to show concern for guaranteeing Soviet security.

    Following the French Foreign Minister, Grewe, who led the Federal Republic of Germany's delegation in place of Federal German Foreign Minister von Brentano, spoke. Grewe tirelessly repeated the clichés of the Bonn propaganda machine, attempting to prove that the Soviet draft peace treaty with Germany meant a "practical refusal to reunify Germany into a single country." At the same time, Grewe deliberately avoided the well-known and undeniable fact that, under the current circumstances, a unified Germany could only be established through an agreement between the two Germanys, and that the Soviet proposal for a peace treaty with Germany would help solve this task. In an attempt to divert attention from the well-known fact of West German militarization, Grewe spread various rumors about the "war preparations" of the German Democratic Republic.

    British Foreign Secretary Lloyd, following Grewe, attempted to prove that the Soviet draft peace treaty with Germany could not lead to a just and lasting solution. As "evidence," he repeated the two untenable arguments of the Western countries: first, that it was impossible to conclude a treaty with the two Germanys; second, that such a treaty was "imposed" by its nature.

    Next to speak was the head of the Soviet delegation, Gromyko. He made some additional comments on the Soviet government's attitude towards the "package plan" of the three Western powers, which he had already explained on the 18th. He refuted certain arguments, including Couve de Murville's claim that the "package plan" was a concession, a compromise that supposedly took the Soviet viewpoint into account. Gromyko said that, clearly, this statement was merely intended to give the "package" a more attractive appearance.

    Referring to Herter's speech yesterday, Gromyko said that Herter opposed the Soviet government's proposal to no longer delay concluding a peace treaty with the two Germanys, arguing that neither the German Democratic Republic nor the Federal Republic of Germany, whether separately or together, could represent Germany. On this point, Gromyko said: We cannot agree that the existence of two Germanys on German territory constitutes a reason to deny the German people a peace treaty. What are the possible ways to break the current deadlock? The Soviet draft peace treaty with Germany offers a solution. This draft is based on the objective fact that, at present, the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany represent Germany. Therefore, it is necessary to conclude a treaty with them. Gromyko said that such a solution could be found in both history and international law. There have been many such cases in the past: wars have led to the disappearance of a country that started the war. In such cases, the peace treaty is concluded by the new states that have emerged in its territory to replace it. Herter's assertion that there are not two Germanys at all, but only one "international entity in the name of Germany," is untenable.

    The head of the Soviet delegation said that everyone knows that this is not the case at all. On the contrary, the two Germanys each maintain active diplomatic, trade, and other relations with dozens of countries around the world. Each of them has concluded many international treaties as an independent sovereign state. Have the United States and other Western countries not signed treaties with the Federal Republic of Germany as if it were a sovereign state?

    Gromyko continued, saying that the U.S. government states that it cannot conclude a peace treaty with the two Germanys, but only with a unified Germany. Here, it is worth asking again: Since this is the case, why did the U.S. government not wait for the establishment of a unified Germany before agreeing to conclude an agreement with one of the two Germanys, the government of the Federal Republic of Germany, to arm the Federal German army with atomic and rocket weapons and to establish atomic rocket installations within the Federal Republic of Germany?

    Herter once said that concluding a peace treaty with the two Germanys is equivalent to "recognizing the permanent division of Germany." On this point, Gromyko said: To interpret the Soviet proposal for a peace treaty with Germany in this way is, to put it mildly, arbitrary. Everyone is very clear that the Soviet Union's reason for proposing a peace treaty with the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany is simple: these two Germanys actually exist now, while a unified Germany does not.

    Gromyko said that the Soviet draft peace treaty with Germany, submitted to this conference for discussion, contains specific clauses stipulating that the treaty will remain in effect after Germany is unified. The draft also takes into account the possibility that the reunification of Germany may have made progress before the treaty is signed, and that a confederation of Germany may already be participating in the signing of the treaty. Where is the "recognition of the permanent division of Germany" here? There is no such thing, and there cannot be, because it is not in line with our policy. The Federal Republic of Germany's representative, Grewe, once said that the Soviet government itself used to believe that the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany should be predicated on the establishment of an all-German government. The head of the Soviet delegation responded to this point by saying: Yes, there was a time when the Soviet Union proposed concluding a peace treaty with an all-German government. Probably many people remember that as early as 1952, the Soviet government proposed a draft of the basis for a peace treaty with Germany, which specifically stipulated the procedure for concluding such a treaty. If the aforementioned draft treaty did not become the subject of study in the relevant negotiations at that time, and the treaty was not concluded, then the responsibility lies not with the Soviet Union, but with those who evaded the proposal at the time, and to a considerable extent with the government of the Federal Republic of Germany.

    Gromyko then pointed out that the situation today is different from that in 1952. The preconditions for establishing an all-German government that existed previously no longer exist; these preconditions have been missed. Why were they missed? This is primarily because West Germany's militaristic policy has further deepened the division between the two Germanys.

    Gromyko emphasized that if we acknowledge that the German people should express their opinions when formulating the peace treaty with Germany, then, in today's situation, the only ones who can express their opinions are the governments of the two German states that have already been formed and actually exist—the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany.

    Gromyko continued, saying that some people tell us that one of the shortcomings of the Soviet draft peace treaty with Germany is that some of the clauses in the draft stipulate certain restrictions on German armaments. Herter compared the Soviet draft to the Treaty of Versailles yesterday. He even hinted that the German people would not tolerate the restrictions stipulated in the draft treaty. Needless to say, this hint can be interpreted as an expression of sympathy for the demands of West German revanchists; figures like the Federal Republic of Germany's Defense Minister Strauss will not forget to use such statements to achieve their own goals.

    Gromyko reminded that the Soviet draft peace treaty with Germany is based on the premise that Germany should have everything it needs for defense, but should not acquire the means that would allow Germany to threaten its neighbors again.

    In response to the West German delegation's assertion that the German Democratic Republic is engaged in so-called war preparations, Gromyko said that this assertion is completely unfounded and simply incorrect. We heard accurate and specific information about the actual situation of the armed forces of the German Democratic Republic from the speech of Dr. Bolz, the Foreign Minister of the German Democratic Republic, yesterday. Let us assume that the government of the Federal Republic of Germany is truly disturbed by the armament of the German Democratic Republic; then I ask: Why is it opposed to concluding a peace treaty with Germany? Certain clauses in this treaty precisely oppose the development of any German—whether in western or eastern Germany—along a militaristic path. Furthermore, if this is the case, why does the government of the Federal Republic of Germany not respond to the proposals made more than once by the German Democratic Republic to reach an agreement on the number, deployment, and mutual supervision of the armed forces of the two Germanys?

    Gromyko concluded by saying that it cannot be considered that the possibility of converging attitudes between countries (including attitudes towards military clauses in the treaty) is no longer possible. He said that by discussing specific issues and certain specific clauses of the draft treaty, it is possible to clarify the attitudes of the conference participants and the possibility of aligning on certain points of view.

    The meeting ended after Gromyko's speech. The next meeting is scheduled for the 20th.

    葛罗米柯重申必须缔结对德和约
    把西方各种反对的借口驳得体无完肤
    新华社20日讯　据塔斯社日内瓦讯：外长会议19日由美国国务卿赫脱担任执行主席，外长们继续讨论苏联提出的关于缔结对德和约建议以及美、英、法三国代表团提出的所谓“一揽子计划”。
    法国外长德姆维尔阐述了法国代表团的态度。他一开始就重弹老调，毫无根据地硬说，由于苏联提出了缔结对德和约和解决柏林问题的建议，便在欧洲造成了“严重的危机”。他力不从心地企图证明，西方国家提出的“一揽子计划”是为了迁就苏联的态度，甚至是在关心保证苏联的安全。
    在法国外长之后发言的是代替德意志联邦共和国外交部长勃伦塔诺率领德意志联邦共和国代表团的格雷韦。格雷韦不厌其烦地重弹曾经多次搬用的波恩宣传机构的陈词滥调，企图证明苏联的对德和约草案意味着“实际拒绝重新统一德国成为一个单一的国家”。同时，格雷韦故意回避那种人所共知和无可争辩的情况，即在当前的情况下，统一的德国只有通过两个德国达成协议才能建立，而苏联提出的缔结对德和约，将有助于解决这一任务。格雷韦为了力图把人们的注意从人所皆知的西德军国主义化的事实上引开，便大肆散布关于德意志民主共和国的“战争准备”之类的种种谣言。
    英国外交大臣劳埃德继格雷韦之后发言，他企图证明，苏联提出的对德和约草案不能导致公正和持久的解决。作为“证据”，他重复了人所共知的西方国家的两个站不住脚的论点：第一，好像不能同两个德国缔约；第二，这种条约就其性质来说是“强加于人”的。
    接着发言的是苏联代表团团长葛罗米柯。他就18日已经阐明的苏联政府对西方三国的“一揽子计划”的态度提出了一些补充意见。他驳斥了某些论断，其中也包括德姆维尔的这样一种说法：“一揽子计划”是一种让步，好像是考虑到苏联观点的一种妥协。葛罗米柯说，显然，这种说法只不过是为了给这个“包裹”加上一个更为迷人的外貌。
    葛罗米柯在谈到赫脱昨天的发言时说，赫脱在昨天的发言中反对苏联政府关于不再拖延同两个德国缔结和约的建议，他反对的理由是：似乎德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国不论是分开还是在一起都不能代表德国。葛罗米柯就这一点说：我们无论如何都不能同意，在德国领土上存在两个德国就可以构成不让德国人民获得和约的理由。摆脱目前的局面可能有什么办法呢？苏联的对德和约草案中提出了这个办法。这个草案的出发点是这样一个客观事实：在目前，德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国代表着德国。因此，必须同它们缔结和约。葛罗米柯说，这种解决办法无论在历史上还是从国际法中都可以找到根据。过去有过不少这样的事情：战争使一个发动战争的国家消失了。在这种情况下，就由在它的领土上代它而出现的一些新国家来缔结和约。赫脱硬说根本不存在两个德国而只有一个“以德国为名的国际单位”，这种说法是站不住脚的。
    苏联代表团团长说，谁都知道，实际上根本不是这么回事，恰恰相反，两个德国都分别同世界上几十个国家保持着活跃的外交、贸易和其他关系。它们中间的每一个国家都作为独立的主权国家缔结了不少的国际条约。难道美国以及其他西方国家正像同一个主权国家那样同德意志联邦共和国签订的条约还算少么？
    葛罗米柯继续说，美国政府声明，美国不能同两个德国缔结和约，而只能同统一的德国缔结和约。这里不妨再一次提出这样一个问题：既然如此，美国政府为什么不等统一的德国建成就认为可以同两个德国中的一个、同德意志联邦共和国的政府缔结协定，来用原子武器和火箭武器武装联邦国防军和在德意志联邦共和国境内建立原子火箭装置呢？
    赫脱曾经说，同两个德国缔结和约等于“承认德国永久分裂”，葛罗米柯就这一点说：这样来解释苏联的对德和约建议，说得客气点，是任所欲为的做法。大家都很清楚，苏联建议同德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国缔结和约的理由很简单，因为这两个德国现在实际上存在，而统一的德国却还没有。
    葛罗米柯说，在苏联政府提交这次会议讨论的对德和约草案中，有一些专门条款规定和约在德国统一以后仍然有效。草案中也考虑到这样的可能性：在和约签字以前，德国重新统一问题已经有所进展，条约已经可能有德国邦联参加签字。这里哪里有“承认德国永久分裂”呢？没有这样的事，而且也不可能有，因为这不符合我们的政策。德意志联邦共和国代表格雷韦曾经说，过去苏联政府自己就曾经认为，缔结对德和约应该以建立全德政府为前提，苏联代表团团长针对这一点说：是的，曾经有一个时候苏联建议过同全德政府缔结和约。大概许多人都记得，早在1952年时，苏联政府曾经提出了一项对德和约基础草案，这项草案正是规定要这样缔结和约的程序。如果说，上述和约草案当时没成为在有关谈判中研究的对象以及和约没能缔结，那么，其责任不在苏联身上，而是在当时回避这一建议的人的身上，在不小的程度上也在德意志联邦共和国政府的身上。
    葛罗米柯接着指出，今天的情况同1952年已经不同了。先前曾经有过的那些建立全德政府的先决条件如今没有了，这些先决条件被错过去了。为什么会这样错过去呢？这首先是由于西德的军国主义政策进一步加深了分裂两个德国的鸿沟。
    葛罗米柯着重指出，如果我们承认，德国人民在制定对德和约时应当表示自己的意见，那么，在今天的情况下，来表示意见的只能是两个业已形成并实际存在的德意志国家——德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国的政府。
    葛罗米柯继续说，有人对我们说，苏联对德和约草案的缺点之一是，在这草案中有一些条款对德国军备规定了一定的限制。赫脱昨天把苏联草案同凡尔赛条约相比。他甚至暗示，德国人民不会容忍在和约草案中所规定的限制。无需说，这种暗示可以被解释为对西德复仇主义者的要求抱同情态度；像德意志联邦共和国国防部长施特劳斯之流不会忘记利用这种声明来达到自己的目的。
    葛罗米柯提醒说，苏联的对德和约草案的出发点是，德国应当有国防所需的一切，但是不能获得能让德国重新威胁邻国的侵犯手段。
    葛罗米柯在回答西德代表团代表断言德意志民主共和国在进行所谓战争准备时说，这种断言完全没有根据，根本是不正确的。德意志民主共和国武装力量实际情况如何，我们从德意志民主共和国外交部长博尔茨博士昨天的发言中听到了确切的、具体的材料。不妨假设德意志联邦共和国政府真是由于德意志民主共和国的武装而感到不安，那么试问：为什么它要反对缔结对德和约呢？这一条约中的某些条款正是反对任何一个德国——无论是德国西部还是东部——沿着军国主义道路发展的。再说，如果这样，德意志联邦共和国政府为什么不回答德意志民主共和国不止一次提出的、就两个德国的武装力量的数目、配置和相互监督问题达成协议的建议呢？
    葛罗米柯最后说，无论如何不能认为各国态度（其中包括对和约中军事条款的态度）相接近的可能性已经没有了。他说，通过对具体问题和和约草案的某些具体条款的讨论，可以阐明全体会议参加者的态度和在某些观点上吻合的可能性。
    会议在葛罗米柯发言后结束。下次会议定于20日举行。
