　　Those Who Attempt to Follow in the Footsteps of British Imperialism Will Reap a Bitter Harvest
    You Guoen’s Speech

Chairman, fellow committee members:

　　I have studied Premier Zhou Enlai’s Government Work Report at the First Session of the Second National People's Congress, Vice Premier Li Fuchun’s Report on the 1959 National Economic Plan, and Vice Premier Li Xiannian’s Report on the 1958 National Final Accounts and the 1959 National Budget. Once again, I recognize the greatness of the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese revolutionary cause it leads, and I have once again received the most concrete and profound revolutionary ideological education. I express my heartfelt and enthusiastic support with unparalleled excitement and encouragement.

    What we see in our country from the above three reports—the great achievements of the first Five-Year Plan and the first year of the second Five-Year Plan (1958)—are truly unprecedented miracles. In particular, the various victories on the economic, political, cultural, and ideological fronts during last year's Great Leap Forward are even more brilliant and radiant. These successive victories have attracted the attention of the world and shocked the imperialists. As Premier Zhou’s report says: Our country has undergone a series of historically significant changes in recent years. From this huge and profound change, I deeply realize the unparalleled superiority of our socialist system, the correct leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, and the high socialist consciousness and soaring revolutionary enthusiasm of the people of the whole country. Without these, such achievements would be absolutely impossible.

    With the arrival of the high tide of socialist economy, a socialist cultural upsurge will inevitably arise. Especially after the anti-Rightist struggle, decisive victories have been achieved on the political and ideological fronts. In the spring of 1958, a vigorous and magnificent situation of an all-round Great Leap Forward in industry and agriculture emerged in vast areas of our country. Driven by this situation, it naturally promoted the development of socialist cultural and educational undertakings. Taking education alone: there are 660,000 students in higher education institutions, an increase of 50 percent compared to 440,000 in 1957. The number of students in secondary schools reached 12 million, an increase of 70 percent compared to more than 7 million in 1957. The number of primary school students reached 86 million, an increase of 34 percent compared to more than 64 million in 1957. The increase in the number of students in other industrial and agricultural spare-time schools is not even included. Such a rapid development in the number of students is also unimaginable in capitalist countries.

    However, the achievements of our education are not only reflected in quantity, but more importantly, in the profound significance of carrying out educational revolution and cultural revolution under the correct leadership of the Party's line and policies in the past year. In this revolutionary process, we have broken superstitions, emancipated our minds, advocated the communist style of daring to think and act, promoted collective collaboration, and promoted science run by the masses; we have criticized conservative thinking, individualistic thinking, bourgeois academic thinking and research methods, and launched a struggle between the two roads of proletarian educational thinking and bourgeois educational thinking. We have implemented the policy of education serving the politics of the working class and combining education with productive labor. Therefore, the appearance of schools at all levels, especially higher education institutions, has been greatly changed, the quality of teaching and scientific level have been improved, and new teacher-student relationships have emerged. All these extremely significant phenomena are the immeasurable achievements in the cultural and educational aspects of the Great Leap Forward last year.

　　Strive to Become a Leftist in Politics, a Reformer in Academics, and a Promoter in Work in a Short Period of Time

　　In the tide of cultural and educational revolution, most of us old intellectuals, whether teachers, scientists, or researchers, have been impacted, and our emotions are inevitably fluctuating. But finally, with the Party's patient education and help, reason overcomes emotion, fluctuations subside, and gradually we have a correct understanding, and our thinking has been improved to varying degrees, and our work has made progress to varying degrees. These are all facts. However, with the continuing Great Leap Forward of socialist construction, the requirements of the objective situation are getting higher and higher, and more and more urgent. Our small progress is far from enough. Our enthusiasm is far less high than that of the workers, peasants, and young students, and our pace is far less fast than theirs. Facing the rapid advancement of the socialist cause in our motherland, how should we old intellectuals do our job to meet the tasks indicated by the Premier on the cultural and educational front: "to make the development of cultural and educational work able to adapt to the needs of the entire socialist construction"? This is our serious topic today. Therefore, it is absolutely necessary to continue conscious revolution, exercise ourselves in work, and transform ourselves into a working-class intellectual who is both red and expert. As for how to carry out self-transformation, I think we must conscientiously study Marxism-Leninism and Chairman Mao's works, establish a revolutionary world view and outlook on life, and lay the ideological foundation for the proletarian revolution; we must measure our political stance with Chairman Mao's six criteria; we must take the Party's line and policies as the guiding light in our work. It is undeniable that old intellectuals have two sides, so we must vigorously overcome its backward side and actively play its progressive side. Only in this way can we better contribute our all to the socialist cause.

    We deeply realize that the leaping situation requires leaping work; leaping work requires leaping thinking. If the obstacles in our thinking are not removed, the driving force cannot be exerted, and of course, there is no question of moving forward by leaps and bounds. Therefore, we must first transform our own thinking in the future; as old intellectuals on the cultural and educational front, we must especially transform our academic thinking, promote the proletarian ideology and eliminate the bourgeois ideology in academic thinking, make great destruction and great establishment, and strive to become a leftist in politics, a reformer in academics, and a promoter in work in a short period of time.

    On the premise of our own efforts and with the Party's education and help, I believe that the transformation of old intellectuals is entirely possible. I have great determination and full confidence!

    Finally, I want to talk about the Tibet issue.

　　The Indian ambitious figures, following in the footsteps of British imperialism, will not have a good result!

    Our country is a unified multinational country. As early as before the 13th century, Tibet was an inseparable part of China. This is an ironclad fact. Before liberation, British imperialism invaded Tibet, attempting to separate Tibet from China. After liberation, thanks to the correctness of the Party's ethnic policies, which conformed to the interests of the Tibetan people, Tibet was peacefully liberated, and an agreement was quickly reached. The People's Liberation Army stationed in Tibet strictly abided by the agreement and respected the customs and habits of the Tibetan people. However, a small handful of reactionary elements in the upper strata of Tibet, disregarding the life and death of the people, vainly attempted to permanently maintain the backward and cruel serf system and build their own interests forever on the suffering of the majority of the people. They dared to collude with imperialism, openly launched a rebellion, and attacked the People's Liberation Army stationed in Tibet. In order to eliminate the bandits and consolidate the unity of the motherland, our People's Liberation Army had to counterattack and pursue them. And this small handful of bandits dared to kidnap the Dalai Lama and flee to India. In the past month, Indian officials and a few newspapers have repeatedly made malicious clamors about this, which is a violation of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the Bandung Conference spirit, and an act of interfering in our internal affairs. This behavior seriously damages the friendly relations between China and India, and we are extremely opposed to it. We solemnly warn some expansionist elements in India that if they vainly attempt to follow in the footsteps of British imperialism and take advantage of this to stir up trouble, it will only benefit imperialism, and in the end, it will not be China that suffers, but India. Can 650 million Chinese people who have stood up, who were able to drive imperialism out of China, be afraid of you, this small handful of expansionist elements? Ambitious figures, quickly wake up your dizzy heads!

### 欲步英帝国主义后尘者必自食恶果  游国恩委员的发言

专栏：

　　欲步英帝国主义后尘者必自食恶果
    游国恩委员的发言主席、各位委员：
　　我学习了周恩来总理在第二届全国人民代表大会第一次会议上所作的政府工作报告、李富春副总理的关于一九五九年国民经济计划的报告、李先念副总理的关于一九五八年国家决算和一九五九年国家预算的报告，再一次地认识到中国共产党和它所领导的中国革命事业的伟大，同时也再一次地受到了最具体最深刻的革命思想教育。我以无比兴奋鼓舞的心情，表示衷心热烈的拥护。
    从以上三个报告中所看到的我国，第一个五年计划和第二个五年计划的第一年——一九五八年的伟大成就，真是旷古未闻的奇迹。特别是去年的大跃进中在经济战线、政治战线、文化战线和思想战线上的各种胜利，更是灿烂辉煌，光芒万丈。这些一个接着一个的胜利引起了全世界的注意和帝国主义者的震惊。正如周总理的报告中所说的：我们的国家在这几年中，经历了一系列的具有重大历史意义的变化。从这个巨大的深刻的变化中，我深深地体会到我们的社会主义制度的无比优越性、党和毛主席的正确领导以及全国人民高度的社会主义觉悟和冲天的革命干劲。如果没有这些，这样的成就是绝对不可能的。
    随着社会主义经济高潮的到来，就必然会兴起一个社会主义的文化高潮。特别在反右派斗争以后，政治战线和思想战线取得了决定的胜利。在一九五八年的春天，我国的广大地区出现了一个万马奔腾、波澜壮阔的工农业全面大跃进的形势。在这种形势的推动下，自然地促使了社会主义的文教事业向前发展。单就教育来说：高等学校的学生有六十六万人，比一九五七年的四十四万人增加了百分之五十。中等学校的学生达到了一千二百万人，比一九五七年的七百多万人增加百分之七十。小学生达到了八千六百万人，比一九五七年的六千四百多万人增加百分之三十四。其他工农业余学校人数的增加还不算在内。学生人数这样飞跃的发展也是资本主义国家不可想像的事。
    但是，我们教育事业的成就不仅仅体现在数量方面，而意义尤其深刻的就是一年来在党的方针政策的正确领导下进行教育革命和文化革命。在这个革命过程中，破除迷信，解放思想，提倡敢想敢干的共产主义风格，提倡集体协作，提倡群众办科学；批判保守思想、单干思想，批判资产阶级的学术思想和研究方法，开展无产阶级的教育思想与资产阶级的教育思想两条道路的斗争。贯彻教育为工人阶级的政治服务、教育与生产劳动相结合的方针。因而大大地改变了各级学校的面貌，特别是高等学校的面貌，提高了教学质量和科学水平，出现了新的师生关系。这一切极其显著的现象更是去年大跃进中文教方面无可估量的成就。
　　争取在短期间成为政治上的左派、学术上的革新派、工作上的促进派
　　在文化教育革命的浪潮中，我们旧知识分子，无论是教师、科学家、研究工作者，多数都受到冲击，情绪不免波动。但终于在党的耐心教育和帮助下，理智克服感情，波动归于平静，逐渐有了正确的认识，思想上有不同程度的提高，工作上有不同程度的进步，这些都是事实。然而随着社会主义建设的继续大跃进，客观形势的要求越来越高，越来越迫切，我们这一点微不足道的进步是十分不够的。我们的积极性远远不如工农群众和青年学生那样高，我们的步伐也远远不如他们那样快。面对着当前祖国的社会主义事业的突飞猛进，我们旧知识分子怎样做岗位工作，以符合总理所指示的在文化教育战线上的任务：“使文教工作的发展能够适应整个社会主义建设的需要”。这就是我们今天的严重课题。因此，继续自觉革命，在工作中锻炼自己，把自己改造成为一个又红又专的工人阶级知识分子就成为绝对必要的了。至于怎样进行自我改造，我认为必须认真学习马克思列宁主义和毛主席的著作，建立革命的世界观、人生观，打下无产阶级革命的思想基础；必须以毛主席的六项标准来衡量自己的政治立场；必须以党的方针政策作为工作中的指路碑。不可否认，旧知识分子具有两面性，因此，就必须大力克服它的落后的一面，积极发挥它的进步的一面。这样才能更好地为社会主义事业贡献自己的全部力量。
    我们深深体会到：跃进的形势要求跃进的工作；跃进的工作更需要跃进的思想。如果我们思想上的障碍不扫除，动力就不能发挥，当然更谈不上大踏步前进。所以我们今后首先要改造自己的思想；作为文教战线上的旧知识分子来说，尤其必须改造自己的学术思想，在学术思想上兴无灭资，大破大立，争取在短期间成为一个政治上的左派，学术上的革新派，工作上的促进派。
    在自己努力的前提下，在党的教育和帮助下，我相信旧知识分子的改造是完全可能的，我有极大的决心同时也有充分的信心！
    最后，我要谈一谈西藏问题。
　　印度的野心家们，步英帝国主义的后尘是不会有好结果的！
    我国是一个多民族的统一的国家。远在十三世纪以前，西藏就已经是中国不可分割的一部分。这是铁的事实。解放以前，英帝国主义侵略西藏，企图把西藏从中国分裂出去。解放后，由于党的民族政策的正确，符合西藏人民的利益，和平解放西藏，迅速达成协议。驻藏的人民解放军严格遵守协议，尊重西藏人民的风俗习惯。而西藏一小撮上层反动分子，不顾人民的死活，妄想永久保持落后的残酷的农奴制，把自己的利益永远建筑在大多数人民痛苦之上。竟敢勾结帝国主义，公然发动叛乱，进攻驻藏的人民解放军。为了消灭叛匪，巩固祖国的统一，我解放军不得不加以反击，进行追剿。而这一小撮叛匪竟敢劫持达赖喇嘛，逃往印度。最近一个月来，印度的官方人士及少数报纸对此屡有恶意的叫嚣，这是违反和平共处五项原则和万隆会议精神，干涉我国内政的行为，这一行为严重地损害了中印友好关系，我们是极端反对的。我们正告印度的一些扩张主义分子，如果妄想步着英帝国主义的后尘，借此兴风作浪，这只会对帝国主义有利，最后吃亏的不是中国，而是印度。六亿五千万站起来的中国人民能够把帝国主义从中国赶出去，难道还害怕你们这一小撮扩张主义分子吗？野心家们，你们发昏的头脑赶快清醒一点吧！
