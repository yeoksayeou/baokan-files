　　Sichuan Farmers Utilize Vacant Land to Increase Grain Planting
　　Northern Fujian Mountain Areas Intercrop Coarse Grains in Young Forests

　　(Our Dispatch from Chengdu, 6th) While concentrating efforts to ensure the completion of the sown area for various crops, Sichuan is carrying out a province-wide "stitching the gaps" grain planting campaign. Under the principles of not occupying cultivated land, not occupying collective labor time, and not occupying commune fertilizer, each person strives to produce an extra 100 jin of unprocessed grain, self-planted and self-obtained. This is an important measure for Sichuan Province to simultaneously pursue "planting less and harvesting more" and "planting more and harvesting more."

　　Sichuan farmers have always had the habit of using land around fields, corners, or vacant land in front of and behind houses to increase grain planting. Last year, various localities led farmers to vigorously engage in increased planting campaigns, which played an important role in increasing grain production. This year, various localities have decided to seize the opportunity, strengthen leadership in utilizing vacant land for grain planting, and carry out the increased planting campaign more effectively. In Wusheng County, brigades and teams of various people's communes have established increased planting guidance groups, led by the brigade leader and team leader respectively, to guide increased planting activities. In addition to widely publicizing the significance of the increased planting campaign and the "self-planted, self-obtained" method, they also earnestly help the masses solve specific problems such as seeds. Due to the thorough and meticulous work of the Fuxing Commune, the enthusiasm of the members is very high. They spontaneously formed thirty-eight shock teams and planted more than 23,000 jin of various melons and beans within five days, using morning and evening rest time. The communes in the Liemian District mobilized more than 20,000 people to increase the planting of more than 73,000 jin of mung beans, corn, etc., while planting more than 560,000 jin of sweet potato seedlings. After the communes in Xichong County launched the increased planting campaign with members, they conducted overall planning and made specific arrangements, with each person able to produce 500 jin of sweet potatoes based on existing conditions. In Nancong County, communes have sown more than 650,000 jin of various crop seeds on vacant land in more than ten days. (Liu Zongtang)

　　(Our Dispatch) People's communes in the mountainous areas of northern Fujian are using all available young forest land and other vacant land to grow food crops. According to statistics, the entire special district has increased its planting area by about one million mu this year alone by increasing the multiple cropping index and intercropping in young forest land. The total area of young forest land in the special district that can be planted with grain is estimated to be about 500,000 mu. Various localities are combining afforestation and forest cultivation with intercropping of food crops.

　　More than 100,000 people in the mountainous areas of northern Fujian are rushing to produce green manure in forests and on vacant land in fields. Under the unified leadership of the commune, the production team is the unit, and a production responsibility system for expanding the production of food crops using vacant land has been formulated, and a reward system for overproduction has been implemented. The Hongcheng Commune in Shaowu County sent out 45 professional remote farming teams, dividing the 12,000 mu of mountain rice fields into 101 small plots, and assigning them to the teams on a contract basis, striving to increase the per-mu yield of grain in all mountain rice fields from 800 jin last year to more than 1,000 jin this year. Production teams in Longxi County, which has a large amount of forest land, have combined afforestation and forest cultivation to plant more than 5,000 mu of various miscellaneous grain crops in forest land. The Xiangyang Brigade of the Hongqi Commune in Minqing County also organized elderly people, children, and other semi-laborers to plant various bean crops on more than 800 mu of paddy field ridges.

　　四川农民利用空地增种粮食
    闽北山区在幼林地间作杂粮
    本报成都6日电　四川各地在集中力量保证完成各种作物的播种面积同时，开展了一个全民性的“见缝插针”的增种运动。在不占用耕地，不占用集体劳动时间，不占用公社肥料的原则下，每人争取多产一百斤原粮，自种自得。这是四川省“少种多收”和“多种多收”同时并行的一项重要措施。
    四川农民一向有利用田边地角或屋前屋后空地增种粮食的习惯，去年各地领导农民大搞增种运动，对粮食增产起了重要作用。今年各地决定抓紧时机，加强利用隙地种粮的领导，把增种运动更有成效地开展起来。武胜县各人民公社的大队和小队都成立了增种指导小组，分别由大队长和小队长任组长，指导增种活动，除广泛宣传增种运动的意义和“自种自得”的办法外，还认真帮助群众解决种子等具体问题。复兴公社由于工作做得深入细致，社员情绪很高，自动组成了三十八个突击小组，利用早晚休息时间在五天内种下各种瓜豆二万三千多斤。烈面区各公社出动两万多人，起早摸黑增种了绿豆、玉米等七万三千多斤，同时栽种窝子苕五十六万多斤。西充县各公社发动社员讨论增种运动后，又进行了全面规划，作了具体安排，每人根据现有条件可生产五百斤甘薯。南充县各公社在十多天时间内，已在空闲地上播各种作物种子六十五万多斤。　（刘宗棠）
    本报讯　闽北山区各人民公社利用一切可以利用的幼林地和其他空闲地种植粮食作物。据统计全专区今年单是由于提高复种指数和利用幼林地进行间作，种植面积就比原计划增加一百万亩左右。全专区可种植粮食的幼林地折算约有五十万亩左右。各地结合造林和育林，正在间作粮食作物。
    闽北山区约有十万多人在林间和田头空地上赶制绿肥。在公社统一领导下，以生产队为单位，制订了利用空闲地扩大粮食作物的生产责任制，并实行超产奖励制。邵武县红城公社各生产队派出了四十五个远耕专业队，把一万二千多亩山垅田划分成一百零一个小片，按队分片包干到底，他们力争全部山垅田今年粮食亩产量由去年的八百斤跃增到千斤以上。林地较多的龙溪县各生产队结合造林育林，在林地种了各种杂粮作物五千多亩。闽清县红旗公社向洋大队还组织老人、儿童等半劳力，在八百多亩稻田埂上种下各种豆类作物。
