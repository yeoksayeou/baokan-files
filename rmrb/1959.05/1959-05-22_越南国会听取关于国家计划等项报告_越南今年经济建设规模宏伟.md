In his report, Huang Anh pointed out that the task of this year's national budget of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is: "To increase the state's financial revenue on the basis of developing industrial and agricultural production and expanding commodity circulation, in order to meet the needs of economic and cultural development, improve the people's material and cultural living standards, strengthen national defense, and serve the cause of socialist transformation."

Huang Anh pointed out that the 1959 national budget is a budget that serves production and the people's lives.

On the 21st, Vietnamese Minister of Justice Vu Dinh Hoe gave a report to the tenth session of the National Assembly on the draft Marriage and Family Law.

Vu Dinh Hoe said that with the development of the cause of socialist revolution and construction in North Vietnam, it is necessary to gradually eliminate the remnants of the feudal marriage and family system and establish a socialist marriage and family system.

Vu Dinh Hoe said that the draft Marriage and Family Law is formulated based on four basic principles: free and progressive marriage, monogamy, equality between men and women, and protection of the rights of women and children. It will enhance the unity within families and among the people, contribute to the development of production and socialist transformation, especially to the development of the rural collectivization movement.

Vu Dinh Hoe then read out the provisions of the bill. The bill stipulates that the goal of marriage under the socialist system in Vietnam is to establish democratic, harmonious, and happy families, ensure the healthy growth of the next generation, and enable people to happily engage in productive labor and improve their lives, so as to build a peaceful, unified, independent, democratic, and prosperous Vietnam.

The draft law specifically stipulates the abolition of the compulsory feudal marriage system and prohibits early marriage. The law also stipulates that adopted children have the same rights and obligations as biological children in the family. Separate provisions will be made for ethnic autonomous regions and ethnic minority areas based on local conditions.

After listening to the government's work reports, the tenth session of the Vietnamese National Assembly entered a three-and-a-half-day group discussion starting on the afternoon of the 21st.

The conference has formed several specialized groups to study the government's reports.
