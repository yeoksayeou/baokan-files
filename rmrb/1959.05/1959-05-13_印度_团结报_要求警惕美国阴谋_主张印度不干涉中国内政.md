Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, May 12th: Some Indian newspapers have recently published editorials, continuing to emphasize that the Tibetan rebellion is China's internal affair and that India should not interfere. They also remind people to be vigilant against the United States taking the opportunity to carry out conspiracies.

The Urdu "Unity Daily" published an editorial today saying that in India, some people "have made many statements full of lies, and even more stupid statements. People are surprised when they hear and read these statements." It pointed out, "Some people in our country are using the Tibet event as an excuse for their anti-China propaganda. They are making a fuss as if India and China are about to go to war; as if Tibet is a province of India, not China."

The newspaper advocated non-interference in China's own affairs, saying, "We should not turn China's internal disputes into disputes between India and China."

The newspaper published an editorial on May 9th, exposing the ulterior motives behind the United States' recent talk of providing "aid" to India. It asked: Why did the United States change its attitude "only after Sino-Indian relations became a bit tense?" It pointed out that due to its dislike of India's policies, the United States has "delayed the settlement of the Kashmir dispute and has also provided military aid to Pakistan."

The Indian "Chinese Journal" published a short commentary on the 11th saying that the Indian People's House's discussion on the Tibetan issue "in our opinion, is absolutely useless. The longer the debate, the more complicated the problem becomes. These speeches and discussions cannot change the Chinese giant."

    印度“团结报”要求警惕美国阴谋
    主张印度不干涉中国内政
    新华社新德里12日电  印度一些报纸最近发表社论，继续强调指出西藏叛乱事件是中国的内政，印度不应当干涉，它们还提醒人们警惕美国乘机进行阴谋活动。
    乌尔都文“团结报”今天发表社论说，在印度有人“发表了许多充满谎话的言论，还有更多的愚蠢的言论。人们在听到和读到这些言论时感到惊讶。”它指出，“我国有些人利用西藏事件作为他们进行反对中国的宣传的借口。他们大惊小怪地闹，好像印度和中国就要打仗似的；好像西藏是印度的一个省，而不是中国的。”
    这家报纸主张不干涉中国自己的事务，并且说，“我们不应当把中国的内部争端变成印度和中国之间的争端”。
    这家报纸在5月9日发表社论，揭露美国最近谈论给予印度“援助”的不良居心。它问道：美国为什么“只是在中印关系变得有点紧张后”才改变了态度？它指出，由于嫌恶印度的政策，美国已经“使克什米尔纠纷迟迟未得解决，它还向巴基斯坦提供了军火援助。”
    印度“文汇报”在11日发表了短评说，印度人民院关于西藏问题的讨论，“在我们看来，是绝对没有用处的。辩论得愈久，问题就愈复杂。这些发言和讨论不能使中国这个巨人改变。”
