    1959 is an even greater year. The Party has put forward the task of socialist construction centered on the four major indicators of steel, grain, coal, and cotton. This is a very glorious and arduous task. To complete this task, we must further improve our leadership methods and better integrate centralized leadership with the mass line. That is, to be "both resourceful and decisive" as advocated by Chairman Mao.
    Objective things are extraordinarily complex, containing many contradictions. To do something well, especially a major undertaking, a series of problems must be solved. To solve these problems, the wisdom and talent of one person or a few people are often limited, so we must rely on and concentrate the wisdom of the broad masses of cadres and people. Therefore, the most important meaning of being resourceful is to consult with the masses on everything, to consult with all kinds of people, and to always follow the mass line. For example, to solve major problems in the people's communes, we must consult with advanced elements, intermediate elements, and also backward elements; we must consult with superiors, peers, and also subordinates. In particular, we must consult with grassroots cadres and the masses, because they directly participate in the practical struggle to change society and change nature, and their experience is often not easily obtained by higher-level cadres.
    Since being resourceful means consulting with all kinds of people, and since the people being consulted have different positions, viewpoints, and methods of understanding, various opinions will naturally arise. Some will grasp the essence of the problem, while others will only see the phenomenon; some will start from the overall situation, while others will focus on the local; some will consider the long-term, while others will plan for the immediate; some will emphasize achievements, while others will emphasize shortcomings; some will only see favorable conditions, while others will only see difficult conditions, and so on, each with their own views. Ultimately, two opposing aspects, correct and incorrect, or advanced and backward, will inevitably form. This opposition is an objective existence, its exposure is a normal phenomenon, and its appearance does not depend on people's subjective likes or dislikes. The existence of opposing sides, as far as the people themselves are concerned, essentially reflects the difference between the advanced and the backward. This difference will not disappear even after ten thousand years. Because the more thoroughly the opposing sides are exposed, the more clearly the various sides of the contradiction are revealed, and the easier it is to find a solution to the contradiction. If we only want to listen to one side, to listen to pleasant words, and try to simplify the contradiction, or even try to force ideological problems to move in uniform like physical exercises, then we will inevitably mess things up, and it is impossible to recognize the true face of things, and impossible to find where the truth lies. Therefore, we must adhere to the principle of "the speaker is not to be blamed, and the listener is to be warned," so that people with various different opinions can speak freely and without reservation, carry out full and free debates, and let the correct and incorrect opinions, the advanced and backward ideas, after debate and comparison, achieve a unified understanding and draw correct conclusions.
    Truth, correct opinions, are usually on the side of the majority. However, in practice, another situation sometimes occurs, that is, the opinions of the majority are wrong, and the opinions of individuals or a minority are correct, because their opinions truly reflect objective reality. Therefore, correct leadership must not only humbly listen to the opinions of the majority, but also respect the opinions of individuals or a minority, and not easily deny their opinions.
    After being resourceful, one must be decisive. Being resourceful provides the conditions for being decisive. But being resourceful does not necessarily mean being decisive. It is not unheard of for things to happen where one is resourceful but not decisive, or resourceful but makes the wrong decision. What is meant by "decisive"? When we fully understand the complex objective situation, and listen to the opinions of all kinds of people, we must comprehensively analyze the overall economic situation, the political atmosphere, and the ideological trends, and then put forward tasks, formulate policies, and determine measures. And these tasks, policies, and measures must be suitable for the current level of awareness of the masses and the current urgent needs of the masses. Anything that violates these two points will not work and will fail.
    To make a correct decision, it is necessary to conduct a detailed analysis and study of the many contradictions that have been exposed, find the main contradictions, and grasp the basic links, which is what we call grasping the central task. Only by grasping the main contradiction can other contradictions be easily resolved. Otherwise, grasping everything indiscriminately, both the eyebrows and the beard, will result in being lost in a sea of smoke, unable to find the center, and unable to find a way to solve the contradiction.
    To make a correct decision, it is also necessary to make new decisions flexibly according to the development and changes of objective things, and the differences in time, place, and conditions. If the struggle of contradictions has pushed the revolutionary cause forward, but the understanding remains at the old stage, and the thinking cannot advance with the changed objective situation, then one will inevitably commit rightist errors. Conversely, if the thinking exceeds a certain stage of the development of the revolutionary cause, takes fantasy as truth, and forces things that can only be done in the future to be done now, and deviates from the practice of the majority of people at present, then one will inevitably commit "leftist" errors.
    Being decisive must also mean being decisive at the right moment. The cause of socialist construction is developing at a high speed, and hundreds of millions of working people are racing against time, fighting for every second. Time is the most precious thing. If, in the face of major events, one is indecisive and delays time, it will bring incalculable losses and create a serious passive situation. Being decisive at the right moment means daring to cut the Gordian knot with a sharp knife, making up one's mind resolutely, and deciding immediately that it can only be done this way and not that way when the situation is complex and the tasks are heavy. Of course, being decisive at the right moment must be based on being resourceful, so that the decision can be accurate, otherwise, it is arbitrary. It would be a serious mistake to treat being decisive at the right moment as arbitrary without being resourceful.
    Decision-making is also centralization. Without a centralized and unified will and action, the result of the decision is equal to empty talk. Therefore, after a decision is made, it is necessary to organize and mobilize cadres and the masses to resolutely implement it. Any ideas and actions of decentralism, departmentalism, and liberalism are undesirable. Our slogan is: be both resourceful and decisive, follow the mass line and implement centralized leadership. Only in this way can we ensure that every battle in our socialist construction cause will be victorious.

### 既要多谋又要善断

    既要多谋又要善断
    1959年是更伟大的一年，党向我们提出了以钢、粮、煤、棉四大指标为中心的社会主义建设任务，这是一项十分光荣而又艰巨的任务。如何才能完成这个任务，这必须进一步改善领导方法，使集中领导与群众路线更好地结合起来。也就是毛主席提倡的要“多谋善断”。
    客观事物是异常复杂的，它包含着许多的矛盾。办好一件事情，特别是办好一件大事，必须解决一系列的问题。要解决这些问题，一个人或者少数人的智慧和才能往往是有限的，必须依靠和集中广大干部和群众的智慧。所以多谋的含义，最重要的就是遇事要与群众商量，要与各种各样的人商量，事事走群众路线。比如，要解决人民公社的重大问题，要和先进分子谋，要和中间分子谋，还要和落后分子谋；要和上级谋，同级谋，还要和下级谋。特别是要和基层干部和群众谋。因为他们直接参加了改变社会和改变自然的实际斗争，他们的经验，上级干部常常不容易取得。
    多谋，既然是要和各种各样的人谋，而谋的人，由于他们的立场、观点不同，认识方法不同，自然就会出现各种各样的意见；有的抓住了问题的本质，有的只看到事物的现象；有的是从全局出发，有的是从局部着眼；有的是从长远考虑，有的是从眼前打算；有的强调成绩，有的强调缺点；有的只看到有利条件，有的只看到困难条件，如此等等，各有所见。最终就必然会形成正确的与不正确的，或者是先进的与落后的对立的两个方面。这种对立面是客观的存在，它的暴露是一种正常的现象，它的出现并不以人们主观上的喜爱和憎恶为转移。对立面的存在，就人民内部来说，实质上是反映了先进与落后的差别。这种差别，一万年之后也不会消灭。因为对立面暴露得越彻底，矛盾的各个侧面就揭露得越明显，解决矛盾的办法就越容易找到。如果只愿意听一面话，听顺耳的话，企图使矛盾简单化，甚至企图强制思想问题像出操一样地整齐动作，那就非把事情弄糟不可，根本不可能认识事物的真象，根本找不到真理在什么地方。因此，必须坚持“言者无罪，闻者足戒”的原则，使抱有各种不同意见的人，毫无保留地畅所欲言，开展充分的自由的辩论，让正确的与不正确的意见，先进的和落后的思想，经过争论，经过比较，求得一致的认识，得出正确的结论。
    真理，正确的意见，在通常情况下，是在多数人的方面。但是，在实践中，有时也出现另外一种情况，即多数人的意见是错误的，个别或者少数人的意见是正确的。因为他们的意见真实地反映了客观实际。所以正确的领导，不仅要虚心地倾听多数人的意见，而且要尊重个别或少数人的意见，不要轻易地否定他们的意见。
    多谋以后必须善断。多谋为善断提供了条件。但多谋不一定就可以善断。谋而不断，谋而错断，这样的事情也并不是没有的。什么叫“善断”？当我们充分了解了客观的复杂情况，倾听了各种人的意见之后，就必须综合分析全面的经济形势，政治空气，思想动态，然后提出任务，制订政策，确定措施。而这些任务、政策、措施，一定要适合当前群众的觉悟水平和当前群众的迫切要求。凡是违背这两条的，一定行不通，一定要失败。
    要断得正确，就必须把暴露出来的许多矛盾，进行细致的分析研究，找出主要的矛盾，抓住基本环节，也就是我们所说的抓中心工作。只有抓住主要矛盾，其他矛盾才容易得到解决。否则，不分主次地眉毛胡子一起抓，结果如坠烟海，找不到中心，也就找不到解决矛盾的方法。
    要断得正确，又必须根据客观事物的发展变化，时间、地点、条件的不同，灵活地作出新的决断。如果矛盾的斗争已将革命事业推向前进了，而认识仍然停留在旧阶段，思想不能随着变化了的客观情况前进，就必然要犯右的错误。相反，如果思想超过革命事业发展的一定阶段，把幻想当真理，把将来才能办到的事，勉强地放在现在来做，离开了当前大多数人的实践，就必然要犯“左”的错误。
    善断，还必须是当机立断。社会主义建设事业在高速度地向前发展，千千万万的劳动人民，都在分秒必争地与时间赛跑。时间是最宝贵的。如果在重大事情的面前，优柔寡断，延误时间，就会带来无法计算的损失，造成严重的被动局面。当机立断，就是要在情况复杂、任务繁重的时候，敢于快刀斩乱麻，狠下决心，立即决定，只能这样办而不能那样办。当然，当机立断，必须是在多谋的基础上，才能断得准确，否则，就是武断。如果把当机立断当做不谋武断，那就是十分错误的了。
    断，也就是集中。没有集中统一的意志和行动，断的结果也就等于纸上谈兵。所以当决断之后，就必须组织动员干部和群众，坚决贯彻执行。任何分散主义、本位主义、自由主义的思想和行动，都是要不得的。我们的口号是：既要多谋又要善断，既要走群众路线，又要实行集中领导。只有这样，才能保证我们的社会主义建设事业的每一个战斗，无往而不胜。
