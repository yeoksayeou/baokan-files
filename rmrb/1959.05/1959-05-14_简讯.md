    Lignin Extracted from Sawdust
    The Shanxi Provincial Department of Commerce's Institute of Plant Comprehensive Utilization and Taiyuan Plastics Factory have collaborated to extract lignin from sawdust and press it into more than ten kinds of products such as electrical materials (lamp holders, switches), transportation equipment (bicycle handlebars), textile appliances (flywheels), and daily necessities (bowls, plates, buttons).

    Experiments have shown that the lignin successfully extracted from sawdust can completely replace formaldehyde and phenol, the main raw materials in the plastics industry. The extraction of lignin is not only simple in equipment, convenient in process, and low in cost, but also can make full use of waste sawdust.

    Monosodium Glutamate Made from Peanut Oil Cake
    Peanut oil cake is the residue after peanut oil extraction and is currently mostly used as feed and fertilizer. Recently, Shenyang Chemical Plant successfully used peanut oil cake to produce monosodium glutamate (MSG) and put it into mass production. Every 100 jin of peanut oil cake can produce 4.2 liters of MSG with a purity of 92% sodium glutamate.

    Alcohol Made from Bracken Roots
    Since it was officially put into production in April last year, Guangyuan Alcohol Factory has used wild bracken roots as raw materials to completely replace grain and potatoes in the production of alcohol (except for the starter), becoming a wild raw material alcohol factory.

    New Raw Material for Liquor Ferment
    In order to save wheat bran, Zhuzhou Winery in Hunan Province successfully used rice bran cake to make ferment.

    The chemical composition of rice bran cake after oil extraction meets the needs of mold growth in ferment production.

    Soy Sauce Made from Rice Bran Cake
    Quanzhou Comprehensive Food Factory uses rice bran cake after oil extraction to brew soy sauce. Every 100 jin of raw materials can produce 200 jin of soy sauce. Its quality is not much different from soybean soy sauce. The analysis shows that it contains 0.68% amino acid nitrogen. The cost of each jin of rice bran cake soy sauce is only 6.2 fen, which reduces the cost by 17.03% compared with soybean soy sauce, and can save grain. The residue after making soy sauce from rice bran cake can still be used as feed.

    锯末提制木质素
    山西省商业厅植物综合利用科学研究所和太原塑料厂协作，用锯末提制木质素，压成电料（灯口、开关）、交通器材（自行车把）、纺织用具（飞轮）以及日用必需品（碗、碟、钮扣）等十多种产品。
    经过试验，从锯末中提制成功的木质素，完全可以代替塑料工业中的主要原料甲醛和苯酚。提制木质素，不仅设备简单、工艺简便、成本低廉，而且可以充分利用废弃的锯末。

    花生油饼制味精
    花生油饼是花生榨油后的残渣，目前大部分做饲料与肥料。最近，沈阳市化学厂试用花生油饼制味精成功，并大量投入生产，每百斤花生油饼，可产味精四点二公升，纯度含谷氨酸纳百分之九十二。
    蕨苔根制酒精
    广元酒精厂自去年四月正式投入生产以来，用野生蕨苔根为原料全部代替了粮食和薯类制酒精（酒母除外），成了一个野生原料酒精工厂。
    酒曲的新原料
    湖南省株洲酒厂为了节约麦麸，试用米糠饼制曲成功。
    榨油后的米糠饼，所含的化学成份合乎曲的霉菌生长的需要。
    米糠饼制酱油
    泉州综合食品厂利用榨油后的米糠饼酿造酱油，每百斤原料可产酱油二百斤，其质量与大豆酱油无甚差别，经化验含氨基酸氮为零点六八。每斤糠饼酱油成本仅六分二厘，比大豆酱油降低成本百分之十七点零三，并可节约粮食，糠饼制造酱油后的渣粕仍可作饲料。
