Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, May 13th: A mass rally of 150,000 people was held in Kim Il-sung Square this afternoon, warmly welcoming the Hungarian Party and Government Delegation led by Münnich Ferenc, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party and Prime Minister of the Worker-Peasant Revolutionary Government.

	Kim Il-sung, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party and Premier of the Cabinet, spoke at the meeting, extending a warm welcome to the Hungarian Party and Government Delegation. He once again expressed his gratitude to the Hungarian people for their assistance to the Korean people during and after the war. He said that the Korean people have full confidence in driving the US imperialists out of South Korea and realizing the peaceful reunification of the motherland.

	Premier Kim Il-sung said that Korean residents in Japan hope to return to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, which is their sacred right that no one can interfere with, and the Korean side has made all preparations to welcome them. However, the Japanese authorities are complicating this issue, which makes people doubt whether the Japanese side is sincere in repatriating Korean residents in Japan. He said, "We demand that the Japanese authorities repatriate them to their homeland as soon as possible."

	Speaking about the Foreign Ministers' Conference currently being held in Geneva, Kim Il-sung said that we fully support the Soviet government's peaceful proposals for concluding a peace treaty with Germany and ending the occupation system in West Berlin, and fully support the Soviet proposals for ending the "Cold War" and establishing a nuclear-weapon-free peace zone in Asia and the Pacific region, and will strive for their realization.

	Premier Kim Il-sung said that the suppression of the rebellion in Tibet launched by a small number of reactionaries in China is entirely China's internal affair, and the clamor of imperialists and expansionists is a blatant interference in China's internal affairs and a challenge to peace and security in Asia. He said: "The Korean people fully support the People's Republic of China's just measures to quell the Tibetan rebellion and resolutely condemn the actions of imperialists and expansionists."

	Prime Minister Münnich then spoke amidst cheers. He warmly praised the great achievements of the heroic Korean people in socialist construction. He said that the Hungarian people are extremely happy about this. He said: The Hungarian people fully support the Korean people's struggle for the peaceful reunification of their motherland and resolutely condemn the imperialists' aggression against Korea.

	Prime Minister Münnich emphasized the significance of strengthening the unity of the socialist camp. He said that no force can stop us from advancing. He also emphasized resolutely opposing revisionism. He pointed out that the revisionism of the Yugoslav ruling clique undermines the international workers' movement and only benefits imperialism.

	Korean party and government leaders attending today's meeting also included Kim Il, First Vice-Premier of the Cabinet; Vice-Premiers of the Cabinet Jeong Il-ryong, Nam Il, Jeong Jun-taek; Vice-Chairmen of the Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party Park Jeong-ae, Park Kum-chul, Kim Chang-man, and others.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, May 13th: According to the Korean Central News Agency, the talks between the delegation of the Korean Workers' Party and the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the delegation of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party and the Worker-Peasant Revolutionary Government, which began on the 8th, concluded today.

	The Hungarian side participating in the talks included: Münnich Ferenc, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party and Prime Minister of the Worker-Peasant Revolutionary Government, and all members of the Hungarian Party and Government Delegation.

	The news said that during the talks, the two sides discussed a series of important issues in the current international situation of concern to both countries and the issue of further developing friendly and co-operative relations between the two countries.

	The talks were conducted in a friendly atmosphere of mutual understanding. The two sides reached complete agreement on the issues discussed.

	This noon, the Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party hosted a banquet to entertain the Hungarian Party and Government Delegation.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, May 13th: The Hungarian Party and Government Delegation led by Prime Minister Münnich returned to Pyongyang this morning after visiting the Korean areas of Sup'ung, Kusong, and Hungnam.

    金日成首相说，旅日朝侨希望返回朝鲜民主主义人民共和国，这是他们的不容任何人干涉的神圣权利，朝鲜方面已经作好了迎接他们的一切准备。但是日本当局正在把这一问题复杂化，这使人不能不怀疑日本方面是否有诚意遣送旅日朝侨归国。他说，我们要求日本当局早日把他们遣送回国。
    金日成在谈到现在正在日内瓦举行的外长会议时说，我们完全支持苏联政府关于缔结对德和约、结束西柏林占领制度的和平建议，完全支持苏联关于结束“冷战”、在亚洲和太平洋地区建立无原子武器和平地区的建议，并为其实现而努力。
    金日成首相说，中国对一小撮反动分子发动的西藏叛乱的平定完全是中国的内政问题，帝国主义者和扩张主义者的叫嚣是对中国内政的粗暴的干涉，是对亚洲和平和安全的挑战。他说：“朝鲜人民完全支持中华人民共和国平定西藏叛乱的正当措施，并且坚决谴责帝国主义者和扩张主义者的行为。”
    明尼赫总理接着在欢呼声中讲话。他热烈赞扬英雄的朝鲜人民在社会主义建设中所取得的伟大成就。他说，匈牙利人民对此感到无比的高兴。他说：匈牙利人民全力支持朝鲜人民和平统一祖国的斗争，坚决谴责帝国主义者对朝鲜的侵略。
