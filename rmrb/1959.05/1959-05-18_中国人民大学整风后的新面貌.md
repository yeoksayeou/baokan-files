The New Look of Renmin University of China After the Rectification Campaign
Ma Jikong, Director of the Academic Affairs Office, Renmin University of China

Based on the rectification movement and the anti-Rightist struggle, Renmin University of China has implemented the Party's policy of education serving proletarian politics and combining education with productive labor, which has brought about tremendous changes in the school. With teaching as the center, teaching, productive labor, and scientific research are closely integrated, and the quality of teaching has been greatly improved.

Before the rectification movement and the anti-Rightist struggle, Renmin University of China had the correct political direction, and its education work always adhered to serving proletarian politics, thus basically completing the tasks assigned by the Party and the state, and the achievements were enormous. However, at that time, there was a certain degree of non-political tendency among the teaching staff, which hindered the implementation of the Party's education policy. After the "double-anti" movement, the heart-to-heart movement, and the organization of Red-Expert great debates, bourgeois individualism was discredited, and the contradiction between Red and Expert ideologies was resolved, which provided a reliable ideological and mass foundation for the comprehensive implementation of the Party's education policy.

In the past year, we have explored some preliminary experiences in implementing the Party's policy.

I. Strengthen political theory education and adhere to the principle of combining theory with practice.

Political theory education occupies a particularly important position in Renmin University, which largely determines the quality of teaching at the school. Before the rectification, political theory paid attention to the systematicness and scientific nature of the courses, and the leading role of teachers in teaching, which were all correct. However, it did a poor job in connecting with the reality of socialist construction, the reality of class struggle, and the ideological reality of students, especially neglecting the connection with productive labor, and therefore there were dogmatic errors to a certain extent and at a certain time. Over the past year, the tendency of dogmatism has been fundamentally overcome. In order to effectively overcome dogmatism, in addition to including productive labor in the teaching plan, the principle of combining theory with practice must be fully implemented in terms of teaching content, teaching methods, and so on.

First, political theory courses implement the policy of walking on two legs.

Political theory course is the most party-spirited science. Its characteristic is to transform ideology through systematic study of theory and participation in actual struggles, so that students master the Marxist-Leninist stand, viewpoint and method, and establish and consolidate the working class worldview and outlook on life.

Last year, political theory education closely cooperated with political tasks and adopted the form of mass movement. The Party's general line for socialist construction, the Party's education policy, the resolution on the people's commune and Chairman Mao's theory on paper tigers and other documents were deeply publicized and studied. The remarkable feature of this study is the close integration of theory, current affairs policies, and ideology, which has become an important force for raising awareness and promoting practical work, and the gains have been very significant. However, there is a lack of systematic study of basic theory courses, a narrow range of knowledge, and a low level of theory. From this, we have gained an experience that political theory courses must be carried out simultaneously with the education of current affairs policies. In this way, on the one hand, there are basic Marxist-Leninist theory courses, namely philosophy, political economy, socialism and communism, and history of the Chinese Communist Party, and on the other hand, there are courses on the situation and tasks, forming two legs walking. The focus is on systematically studying basic political theory courses, emphasizing reading more books, and requiring understanding of classic works. Since February this year, these five political courses have been offered, and the study time is generally about twelve hours per week, including four hours for the situation and task course. Practice has proved that this is correct. This approach organically combines the study of theory with the transformation of ideology, and the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the Party's policies.

Second, build political theory course materials based on the principle of studying and solving China's actual problems as the center and guided by the basic principles of Marxism-Leninism.

In last year's education revolution, we mobilized all teachers and students to thoroughly expose various manifestations of dogmatism. On this basis, a team of 4,188 teachers and students was formed, visiting 2,500 units in 18 provinces, cities, and autonomous regions across the country, down to counties, communes, factories, and mines, to conduct investigations and research, and collect information needed to reform teaching content. In this process, under the leadership of the Party, teachers and students cooperated and consulted with competent people outside the school to jointly discuss the teaching content of political theory courses, and established the policy of building teaching materials with the study and solution of practical problems of the Chinese revolution and construction as the center and guided by the basic principles of Marxism-Leninism, organically combining universal laws and national characteristics, history and reality, today and tomorrow, theory and policy, and strengthening criticism of revisionism and bourgeois viewpoints. According to this spirit, 92 kinds of teaching syllabuses, lecture notes, textbooks, and reference materials for political theory courses were compiled, totaling 15.13 million words. This is an extremely important task, which has greatly improved the content of political theory teaching.

The Department of History of the Chinese Communist Party has preliminarily completed the revision of the "Lecture Notes on the History of the Chinese Revolution." And according to the development process of the Party, selected issues with theoretical and practical significance for special lectures, and compiled "Several Issues on the Chinese Revolution and Construction by Comrade Mao Zedong."

The Department of Marxist-Leninist Fundamentals has newly established the course "Socialism and Communism" from this semester, the main content of which is the basic theoretical knowledge of scientific socialism. Under the current conditions in our country, in addition to elaborating on the universal laws of socialist revolution and socialist construction, it also prominently highlights major theoretical issues such as the people's commune, the two transitions, and the correct handling of contradictions among the people. For the construction of teaching materials for this course, in cooperation with fraternal institutions, a teaching syllabus (draft) has been written and a bibliography of classic works has been compiled, and some special materials have been printed. In order to train political course teachers, a professional course "History of the International Communist Movement" has also been opened.

The Department of Philosophy conscientiously implemented Comrade Mao Zedong's philosophical thought in the teaching content, and compiled three volumes of "Compilation of Documents for Studying Mao Zedong's Philosophical Works." In addition to compiling the three works "On Contradiction," "On Practice," and "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," this book also selected many important classic works and documents related to Marxism-Leninism, which laid the foundation for compiling systematic philosophy teaching materials in the future. In addition, a "Teaching Syllabus for Dialectical Materialism and Historical Materialism" (draft) has also been compiled.

The Department of Economics compiled a set of lecture notes (draft) for the socialist part of political economy. In the lecture notes, special attention was paid to the documents of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao's works, and efforts were made to theoretically summarize the experience of socialist transformation and socialist construction in our country. At the same time, guided by the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism, it fully absorbed the scientific achievements of the Soviet "Textbook of Political Economy."

The above-mentioned teaching content of political theory courses still has many shortcomings and needs to be further improved.

Third, reform teaching methods, combining the leading role of teachers with students' independent study, and combining classroom learning with participation in actual struggles.

In the teaching process, a combination of lecturing (introduction), self-study guidance, airing views and debates, and summarization is adopted. The lecturing method is flexible, depending on the teaching content and students. Some focus on systematic lecturing, some make introductory reports, and some are special lectures.

Self-study is the process of students' independent research, and they will encounter various difficulties; this requires strengthening the guidance work of teachers. Guidance is to carry out teaching work from the actual situation of students, and at the same time, it is to guide students to learn the learning method of combining theory and practice.

Airing views and debates is the fundamental policy for carrying out academic activities. Facts have proved that airing views and debates should also be carried out when systematically studying Marxist-Leninist theory. For example, after studying a certain unit, concentrated time is used to conduct airing views and debates. When students of the Department of History of the Chinese Communist Party studied the period of the First Domestic Revolutionary War, they launched a discussion, raised many questions, and then centrally debated issues such as "the contemporary national independence movement" and "the historical experience of Chen Duxiu's opportunism." For example, using the form of rectification to link ideology and work to carry out great airing of views, debates has become a learning atmosphere, so that this learning is targeted, has opposing sides, has disputes, and the learning is relatively thorough, lively and vivid.

On the basis of lecturing, self-study, airing views and debates, it is very necessary to summarize the study.

In addition, combining visits, investigations, participation in productive labor and social work in teaching can combine indirect experience with direct experience, which has a great effect on strengthening the connection between theory and practice, transforming ideology, and improving teaching quality.

The above-mentioned teaching methods absorb both the good experiences before the rectification and the new experiences since the rectification, and have established a relatively good set of teaching methods on a new basis. We believe that this is in line with the requirements of Marxist-Leninist theory itself, and is also consistent with the Party's educational goals and training goals.

Finally, improve the organizational form of teaching and combine the teaching of political theory courses with the Party's political and ideological work.

From the rectification to the present, the following teaching forms have emerged: The first is that, under the direct leadership of the Party branch, teachers are the main body, and some student party members and cadres are directly involved in the lesson preparation activities. First, study how to make an introductory report according to the course content, the current situation and tasks, and the students' and ideological conditions for a certain unit; then discuss how to guide students to study on their own, strengthen the connection between theory and practice, and solve theoretical and ideological problems through airing of views and debates; finally, the teacher makes a study summary based on the problems existing in the study. The second is to form a teaching group with the year or class as a unit, composed of the main lecturer and the student branch secretary. Under the leadership of the Party branch, discuss teaching issues, understand the students' ideological trends, and strengthen the guidance of students' study, ideology, and life. The third is to establish a class teacher system, with the teacher in charge of the course serving as the class teacher; he is both a teacher and a Party cadre appointed by the Party branch, participating in the work of the student branch and assisting the Party branch to fully grasp the students' learning, ideology, and living conditions, and implement the intentions of the Party branch.

These are all teaching forms that implement the mass line, which can closely connect teachers and students, cooperate and help each other under the guidance of teachers, teach and learn from each other, so that teaching work and the Party's political work are in sync, teaching both knowledge and people, thus strengthening the Party's leading role in teaching work.

II. Conscientiously implement the policy of combining education and productive labor, incorporate productive labor into the teaching plan, and closely link teaching and scientific research with production practice and the reality of class struggle, thereby improving teaching quality.

Undergraduate students have seven and a half to eight and a half months of teaching time and two to three months of productive labor each year, depending on their major.

Productive labor takes the approach of running factories, farms, and stores on campus and going down to factories and the countryside on two legs. The forms of participating in productive labor are diverse. When the political and legal theory departments such as Marxist-Leninist fundamentals, economics, and law go to the countryside, they adopt the method of combining productive labor, social work, ideological transformation, learning, and investigation and research. They came into contact with various problems in real life, participated in actual struggles, further studied theory, and improved their ideological and theoretical level. The Department of Philosophy combined going to factories and the countryside with popularizing philosophy, compiled workers' philosophy textbooks and farmers' philosophy textbooks, and improved themselves in popularization. The teachers and students of the Department of Journalism combined with running newspapers, compiled more than a dozen newspapers for factories, rural areas, and government agencies, and systematically conducted investigations and research, and improved the textbook compilation work.

No matter what form is adopted, productive labor is combined with ideological transformation and with professional learning. Practice has proved that this has combined school education with the practice of socialist revolution and construction, combined theory with practice, and combined intellectuals with workers and peasants, transformed ideology, transformed learning, improved teaching quality, and opened up a way to cultivate red and expert working-class intellectuals. Some students said based on their personal experience: "In the past, although I read a lot of books, my understanding of problems was always vague. There seemed to be a layer of sky between theory and practice, and my mind was always unclear. Now, when I study theoretical problems, I naturally consider practical problems, and when I encounter practical problems, I naturally conduct theoretical analysis."

Since the majors of our school belong to the nature of philosophy and social sciences, it is more appropriate to adopt the method of going to factories and the countryside for labor. In this way, social surveys can be better combined, contact with workers and peasants can be strengthened, and participation in grass-roots work training can be carried out. At the same time, the factories, farms, and stores run on campus should be closely integrated with the needs of the major to facilitate the close integration of teaching and productive labor.

III. Conduct extensive and in-depth scientific research activities, incorporate scientific research into the teaching plan, and promote teaching work.

In the past year, more than 6,400 scientific research works have been written, equivalent to 6.4 times the previous eight years. Scientific research has broken through the scope of a few people and formed a mass-based new situation. More than 90% of the teachers and students in the school have participated in scientific research work. The school has held more than 1,000 different types of scientific discussion meetings.

The selection of scientific research topics is closely combined with China's actual situation and closely serves the Party's political tasks and teaching work. For example, there are more than 4,000 treatises on studying Mao Zedong Thought and summarizing the experience of socialist revolution and socialist construction, especially the research on a series of major theoretical and practical issues raised since the communization of the people's communes is the most common. Such as "The Party's General Line for Socialist Construction and Our Country's Policy for Building Socialism," "The Difference and Connection Between Socialism and Communism," "The Ownership and Distribution System of the People's Commune," "Commodity Production and the Law of Value," and "The Foundation and Superstructure of Socialist Society" and other issues. For example, a comprehensive critique has been launched on modern revisionist theories, bourgeois sociology, political science, economics, philosophy, law, history, literature, and journalism, and hundreds of treatises have been written. For example, great efforts have been made in the compilation of teaching materials, and a total of 243 kinds of teaching materials and teaching materials have been published, totaling 31.73 million words and 2.08 million copies.

In order to closely integrate scientific research with teaching, implement the mass line of scientific research, and make it regular, we have incorporated students' scientific research into the teaching plan, so that it is combined with participation in production, social investigation, production internship, academic year thesis, and graduation thesis. This approach is especially necessary for senior students. Now scientific research groups have been widely established among students and carry out activities frequently. For example, the students of the third grade of the Department of Philosophy's Research Class wrote 40 related papers when studying historical materialism using the method of learning while working. Under the guidance of teachers, they actively compiled lecture notes on historical materialism; in the popularization of philosophy, they compiled lecture notes on dialectical materialism and carried out the compilation of the outline of the history of Marxist-Leninist philosophy.

In scientific research, the large-scale cooperation between schools and outside schools has been strengthened, and each teaching and research office has established regular contacts with relevant departments outside the school, which has improved the quality of research and promoted teaching work. For example, the Commodity Science Teaching and Research Office has been closely linked with the commercial departments in Beijing and Shanghai for more than half a year, jointly summarizing work experience and conducting scientific research, and has completed the task of compiling 2 million words of teaching materials, and compiled works such as commodity science textbooks, Beijing vegetable management studies, and grain commodity science lecture notes.

IV. Go deep into practice and conduct extensive investigation and research to create conditions for improving teaching and enriching scientific research.

In the past year, a total of more than 5,000 teachers and students have been organized to go deep into practice to carry out investigation and research activities. In terms of methods, some are combined with productive labor, some are cooperated with external business departments, scientific institutions or fraternal institutions, and some are combined with teaching work and scientific research. The scope of investigation covers the people's communes, factories and mines, and practical work departments in more than 20 provinces, cities, and autonomous regions. A total of more than 1,000 investigation reports have been written, about 12 million words, and the content is very extensive, including economic, political and legal, historical, cultural and educational, and ideological education aspects. This batch of investigation reports includes comprehensive materials, as well as typical materials and specific descriptions of a commune, a production team, a family, and a person.

Facts have proved that social investigation is of special and great significance to philosophy and social science majors. First of all, it can combine direct experience and indirect experience, accumulate a large amount of practical materials, prepare conditions for compiling teaching materials suitable for our country's needs, and strengthen the combination of theory and practice in teaching. Secondly, it can provide rich information for scientific research and provide certain help to the work of business departments. Finally, it can broaden the horizons of teachers and students, understand the actual situation, and strengthen the materialistic dialectical thinking methods and research methods starting from reality. Therefore, we have decided to further carry out investigation and research activities in a planned way, and begin to set up investigation and research courses in individual departments. After gaining experience, we plan to formally include them in the teaching plan.

In the past year, our school has gained some experience in implementing the Party's education policy, but there are still many shortcomings and problems. The experience is still not enough, and the methods are not perfect enough. We must not be satisfied with the achievements we have made. We must go all out, continue to work hard, and sum up experiences and lessons in a timely manner in order to strive for the complete victory of the Party's education policy.

    中国人民大学整风后的新面貌
    中国人民大学教务处处长　马纪孔
    在整风运动和反右派斗争的基础上，中国人民大学贯彻执行了党的教育为无产阶级政治服务、教育与生产劳动相结合的方针，使学校的面貌发生了极大的变化。以教学为中心的教学、生产劳动和科学研究密切地结合起来，教学质量大为提高。
    中国人民大学在整风运动和反右派斗争以前，政治方向是正确的，教育工作始终坚持为无产阶级的政治服务，因而基本上完成了党和国家交付的任务，成绩是巨大的。但是，当时在教学工作人员中，存在着一定程度的非政治倾向，妨碍着党的教育方针的贯彻。经过“双反”运动、交心运动、组织红专大辩论，搞臭了资产阶级个人主义，解决了红专思想与白专思想的矛盾，这才为全面地贯彻党的教育方针提供了可靠的思想基础和群众基础。
    一年来，在执行党的方针中，我们摸索到一些初步的经验。
    一、加强政治理论教育，坚持理论和实际相结合的原则。
    政治理论教育在人民大学占有特殊重要的地位，在很大程度上决定着学校的教学质量。整风以前，政治理论注意到课程的系统性和科学性，注意到教师在教学中的主导作用，这些都是正确的。但是，对联系社会主义建设的实际、阶级斗争的实际和学生的思想实际做得很差，特别是忽略了联系生产劳动，因而在一定时期和一定程度上有教条主义的错误。经过去年一年，就从根本上克服了教条主义的倾向，为了有效地克服教条主义，除了将生产劳动列入教学计划外，必须在教学内容、教学方法等方面，全面贯彻理论和实际相结合的原则。
    首先，政治理论课实行两条腿走路的方针。
    政治理论课是党性最强的科学，它的特点是通过系统的学习理论和参加实际斗争来改造思想，来使学生掌握马克思列宁主义的立场、观点和方法，树立和巩固工人阶级的世界观和人生观。
    去年，政治理论教育紧密地配合了政治任务，采取了群众运动的形式。深入地宣传和学习了党的社会主义建设总路线、党的教育方针、人民公社问题的决议和毛主席论纸老虎等文件。这种学习的显著特点是将理论、时事政策、思想密切结合起来，成为提高觉悟、推动实际工作的重要力量，收获是十分显著的。但缺乏对于基础理论课系统的学习，知识面不广，理论水平不高。从这里，我们得到了一条经验，政治理论课必须和时事政策的教育同时进行。这样，一方面是马列主义基础理论课程，即哲学、政治经济学、社会主义与共产主义、中共党史，一方面是形势与任务的课程，形成了两条腿走路，重点是系统地学习基础的政治理论课，强调多读书，并要求读懂经典著作。从今年2月开始，这五门政治课都开设了，在学习时间上，一般每周为十二小时左右，其中形势与任务课四小时。实践证明，这样做是正确的。这种做法是把学习理论和改造思想、是把马克思列宁主义的普遍真理和党的方针政策有机地结合了起来。
    其次，以研究和解决中国实际问题为中心，以马列主义基本原则为指导的方针，进行政治理论课的教材建设。
    在去年的教育革命中，我们发动全校师生彻底揭露了教条主义的各种表现形式。在这个基础上又组成了四千一百八十八人的一支师生队伍，走访了全国十八个省、市、自治区，直到县、社、工厂、矿山，共二千五百个单位，进行调查研究，搜集改革教学内容所需要的资料。在这一过程中，在党的领导下，师生合作，并向校外的能者请教，共同讨论政治理论课的教学内容，确立以研究和解决中国革命和建设的实际问题为中心、以马列主义基本原则为指导的教材建设方针，将普遍规律和民族特点、历史和现实、今天和明天、理论和政策有机地结合起来，并且加强对修正主义和资产阶级观点的批判。根据这种精神，编写了政治理论课的教学大纲、讲义、教科书、参考资料共九十二种、一千五百一十三万字。这是一项极为重要的工作，大大地改进了政治理论课教学的内容。
    中共党史系初步地完成了“中国革命史讲义”的修订工作。并依据党的发展过程，选择有理论意义和现实意义的问题进行专题讲授，编写了“毛泽东同志论中国革命和建设的几个问题”。
    马列主义基础系从本学期起新设了“社会主义与共产主义”课程，主要内容是科学社会主义的基本理论知识。在我国当前条件下，除阐述社会主义革命和社会主义建设的普遍规律外，还把人民公社、两个过渡、正确处理人民内部矛盾等重大理论问题突出地加以发挥。这门课的教材建设，在和兄弟院校合作下，已写出教学大纲（初稿）和编出经典著作书目，编印了一些专题资料。为了培养政治课师资，还开设了专业课“国际共产主义运动史”。
    哲学系在教学内容中认真贯彻了毛泽东同志的哲学思想，编出了“毛泽东哲学著作学习文件汇编”三册。这本书除编入“矛盾论”、“实践论”、“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”三本著作外，还选编了有关马克思列宁主义的许多重要经典著作和文件，这就为今后编写系统的哲学教材打下了基础。此外，还编写出了“辩证唯物主义与历史唯物主义教学大纲”（初稿）。
    经济系编写了一套政治经济学社会主义部分的讲义（初稿），在讲义中，特别重视了党中央的文件和毛主席的著作，力求从理论上概括我国社会主义改造和社会主义建设的经验。同时，以马克思列宁主义的普遍真理为指导，充分吸取了苏联“政治经济学教科书”的科学成果。
    上述的政治理论课的教学内容还存在着不少缺点，需要进一步改进和提高。
    再次，改革教学方法，教师的主导作用和学生的独立钻研相结合，课堂学习与参加实际斗争相结合。
    在教学环节上，采取了讲授（引言）、自学辅导、鸣放辩论、总结相结合的方法。讲授方式是灵活的，根据教学内容和学生对象而定。有的着重系统讲授，有的作引言报告，有的是专题讲授。
    自学是学生独立钻研的过程，会遇到种种疑难；这就要加强教师的辅导工作。辅导是从学生实际出发来进行教学工作，同时又是指导学生学习理论和实际相结合的学习方法。
    鸣放辩论是开展学术活动的根本方针。事实证明，在系统学习马克思列宁主义理论时也应该展开鸣放辩论。如学习到一定单元，利用较集中的时间进行鸣放辩论。中共党史系学生学习到第一次国内革命战争时期，展开了讨论，提出了许多问题，然后集中地辩论“当代民族独立运动”和“陈独秀机会主义的历史经验”等问题。再如，用整风形式联系思想、联系工作大鸣大放大辩论，成为一种学习风气，使这种学习做到有的放矢，有对立面，有争论，学习较为深透，生动活泼。
    在讲授、自学、鸣放辩论的基础上，对学习进行总结是十分必要的。
    此外，在教学中还结合参观访问、调查研究、参加生产劳动和社会工作，这能使间接经验与直接经验相结合，对加强理论和实际的联系、改造思想、提高教学质量有很大的作用。
    采取上述的教学方法，既吸收了整风以前的良好经验，又采用了整风以来的新经验，在新的基础上建立了一套比较好的教学方法。我们认为，这是符合马克思列宁主义理论本身的要求的，也是与党的教育目的和培养目标相一致的。
    最后，改进教学组织形式，把政治理论课的教学和党的政治思想工作结合起来。
    整风后到目前为止，出现了这样的几种教学形式：第一种是，在党总支直接领导下，以教师为主体，吸收某些学生党员干部直接参加备课活动。先是研究某个单元如何根据课程内容，当前的形势与任务、学生和思想状况做引言报告；再是讨论如何指导学生自学，加强理论与实际的联系，通过鸣放、辩论，解决理论上与思想上存在的问题；最后，根据学习中存在的问题由教师作学习总结。第二种是，以年制或班级为单位成立教学组，由主讲教师和学生支部书记组成。在党总支的领导下讨论教学问题，了解学生的思想动态，加强对学生学习、思想、生活的指导工作。第三种是，建立班主任制度，由任课教师任班主任；他一方面是教师，一方面又是党总支指派的党的干部，参加学生支部工作，协助党支部全面掌握学生的学习、思想和生活情况，贯彻党总支的意图。
    这些都是贯彻群众路线的教学形式，可以密切师生关系，在教师指导下合作互助，教学相长，使教学工作和党的政治工作步调一致，教书又教人，这样也就加强了党对教学工作的领导作用。
    二、认真执行教育和生产劳动相结合的方针，把生产劳动列入教学计划，使教学、科学研究与生产实际、阶级斗争实际密切联系，从而提高了教学质量。
    本科学生根据专业的不同，每年教学时间为七个半月到八个半月，生产劳动为二至三个月。
    生产劳动采取校内办工厂、农场、商店与下厂下乡两条腿走路的办法。参加生产劳动的形式是多种多样的。马列主义基础、经济、法律等政法理论系下乡时，采取生产劳动、社会工作、思想改造、学习、调查研究五结合的办法，接触了实际生活中的各种问题，参与了实际斗争，进一步钻研理论，提高了思想理论水平。哲学系下厂下乡和普及哲学相结合，编写了工人哲学课本、农民哲学课本，在普及中提高了自己。新闻系师生则和办报相结合，为工厂、农村、机关编报十几种，并且有计划地进行了调查研究，改进了教材编写工作。
    不论采取何种形式，生产劳动既与改造思想相结合，也与专业学习相结合。实践证明，这就使学校教育与社会主义革命和建设的实际结合了起来，使理论与实践结合了起来，使知识分子与工农群众结合了起来，改造了思想，改造了学习，提高了教学质量，为培养红透专深的工人阶级知识分子开辟了道路。有的学生根据切身体会说：“过去的学习，书虽然看了不少，但对问题的理解总是模模糊糊，理论与实践之间，好像隔着一层天似的，脑袋里总是不亮堂。现在学习理论问题的时候，就很自然地考虑实际问题，遇到实际问题，就很自然地进行理论分析。”
    由于我校的专业属于哲学社会科学性质，因此以较多地采取下厂下乡劳动的方式为宜。这样，可以更好地结合社会调查，接触工农群众，参加基层工作锻炼。同时，校内办的工厂、农场、商店要密切结合专业的需要，便于教学和生产劳动紧密结合。
    三、广泛深入地开展科学研究活动，把科学研究列入教学计划，推动教学工作。
    一年来，共写出科学研究作品六千四百多篇，相当于已往八年的六点四倍。科学研究突破了少数人的范围，形成了群众性的新局面。在校师生的90％以上都参加了科学研究工作。全校召开过一千多次不同类型的科学讨论会。
    科学研究的选题密切结合我国的实际，紧密地为党的政治任务和教学工作服务。如在研究毛泽东思想、总结社会主义革命和社会主义建设经验方面的论著有四千多篇，特别是关于人民公社化以来所提出的一系列重大理论问题和实际问题的研究，最为普遍。如“党的社会主义建设总路线和我国建设社会主义的方针”、“社会主义与共产主义的区别和联系”、“人民公社的所有制和分配制度”、“商品生产和价值规律”、“社会主义社会的基础和上层建筑”等问题。又如对现代修正主义理论，资产阶级的社会学、政治学、经济学、哲学、法学、史学、文学和新闻学等，展开了全面的批判，写出论著数百篇。再如大力进行了教材的编写工作，已出版的教材、教学资料共二百四十三种、三千一百七十三万字、二百零八万册。
    为了使科学研究和教学密切结合，贯彻科学研究的群众路线，并使其经常化，我们把学生的科学研究列入了教学计划，使它和参加生产、社会调查、生产实习、学年论文、毕业论文结合起来。这种作法，特别在高年级学生中更是必要。现在学生中广泛地成立了科学研究小组，经常开展活动。如哲学系研究班三年级的学生用边干边学的办法，在学习历史唯物主义时，就写出四十篇有关的论文。在教师指导下，积极编写历史唯物主义讲义；在普及哲学中，编写了辩证唯物主义讲稿，并进行马列主义哲学史提纲的编写工作。
    在科学研究上，加强了校内外的大协作，各教研室同校外有关部门建立经常联系，提高了研究质量，推进了教学工作。如商品学教研室半年多来与北京、上海的商业部门紧密挂钩，共同总结工作经验，搞科学研究，完成了二百多万字的教材编写任务，编出了商品学教材、北京蔬菜经营学、粮食商品学讲义等著作。
    四、深入实际，广泛地进行调查研究，为改进教学和丰富科学研究创造条件。
    一年来，共组织五千多名师生深入实际开展调查研究活动。在方式上，有的与生产劳动结合，有的与校外业务部门、科学机关或兄弟院校协作，有的与教学工作、科学研究结合。调查范围普及二十多个省、市、自治区的人民公社、厂矿企业和实际工作部门。共写出调查报告一千多件，约一千二百万字，内容十分广泛，包括经济、政法、历史、文教、思想教育等方面。这批调查报告，有综合的材料，也有一个公社、一个生产队、一个家庭、一个人物的典型材料和具体记述。
    事实证明，社会调查对于哲学社会科学专业具有特殊重大的意义。首先，可以将直接经验和间接经验结合起来，积累大量实际材料，为编写适合我国需要的教材准备了条件，加强教学中理论和实际的结合。其次，可以为科学研究提供丰富的资料，对业务部门的工作有一定的帮助。最后，可以使师生开阔眼界，了解实际状况，加强从实际出发的唯物辩证的思想方法和研究方法。因此，我们决定要进一步有计划地开展调查研究活动，开始在个别系设调查研究课程，待取得经验后，拟正式列入教学计划。
    一年来，我校贯彻党的教育方针取得了一些经验，但是还存在许多缺点和问题，经验还很不够，办法也不够完善，我们决不能满足已经取得的成就，必须鼓足干劲，继续努力，及时地总结经验教训，为使党的教育方针取得彻底的胜利而奋斗。
