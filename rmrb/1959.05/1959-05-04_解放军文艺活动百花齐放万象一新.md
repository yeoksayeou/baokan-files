Comrade Committee Members:

I wholeheartedly endorse Premier Zhou's "Government Work Report" and the reports by Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and Vice Chairman Li Weihan.

Premier Zhou's "Government Work Report" comprehensively summarizes the achievements in various tasks since the liberation of the mainland. It is a summary of the great victory of Marxism-Leninism in practice in China; it is evidence that the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao lead the Chinese people to overcome all difficulties and win all battles; it is the result of the leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao. In addition to giving me infinite strength, the report also evoked many memories! I don't intend to dwell on the past here, but beneficial memories make today's achievements all the more precious and strengthen the belief in building the motherland in the future. Our country, although vast in territory, abundant in resources, and large in population, with five thousand years of ancient culture... has been persecuted by imperialism and exploited by feudal warlords for nearly a hundred years, leaving it utterly poor. When some industrialized countries were using steel to make doors and windows, we couldn't even buy enough iron nails for our needs in the townships. However, within the nine years after the liberation of the mainland, astonishing achievements have been made in industrial production, agricultural production, basic construction, cultural education, literature and art, and financial revenue and expenditure. Taking steel production as an example, in 1958 alone, we produced more than 11 million tons. In contrast, from 1890 to 1948, including Northeast China under Japanese occupation, the total steel production in fifty-nine years was only 7.6 million tons. It is a fact that China has always lacked sufficient grain. Imperialists once said, "The Chinese people are forever sick men with empty stomachs." But now, not only have we not asked anyone for grain, but we also have surplus grain. Those who once said we couldn't eat enough are now afraid that we will sell grain to "their markets." Regarding "sick men," we dare not say that we don't get sick, but we dare to say that we are the bravest people in the world in eliminating mosquitoes and flies, far better than those war merchants who raise flies and rats to engage in germ warfare. The era when imperialism manipulated us is gone forever, and backwardness and poverty will also pass. Today, the Chinese people live a free and happy life, have established people's communes, and are welcoming the tenth anniversary of the National Day with a greater leap forward. All this is because of Marxism-Leninism; the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao; and the efforts of the vast number of cadres and the broad masses under the leadership of the Party. Without the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, we really don't know what our country would be like now! It's unimaginable.

Our PLA commanders and fighters, after reading Premier Zhou's report, are all open-minded and high-spirited, with a hundredfold confidence in building a socialist motherland. Chairman Mao pointed out that when engaging in socialist construction, we should simultaneously develop industry and agriculture, walk on two legs, adapt to local conditions, combine foreign and local methods, go all out, aim high, and achieve greater, faster, better, and more economical results... and the "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" policy in literature, art, and science is a creative development of Marxism-Leninism in China, and the main reason for our great achievements in socialist construction. The past ten years of civil war, eight years of the War of Resistance Against Japan, defeating the US-Chiang, and liberating the Chinese mainland were all inseparable from Chairman Mao's correct ideological guidance. We are proud to have the great leader Chairman Mao.

What is mentioned in the report has been achieved, and we will certainly be able to accomplish the tasks proposed for the future. During the war, the commanders and fighters of our army often said: "Wherever the Party and Chairman Mao point, we will fight there." Today, the people of the whole country will say: Wherever the Party and Chairman Mao say, we will certainly do it.

Now I want to talk a bit about the situation of literary and artistic work in the troops:

One Stroke, Three Benefits

In the past ten years, the motherland has been advancing by leaps and bounds, and literary and artistic activities, under the guidance of the "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" policy, have shown a vibrant scene. The whole country is like this, and the literary and artistic activities of the Chinese People's Liberation Army are no exception. It can be said that a hundred flowers are blooming, and everything is new! In particular, after the rectification and anti-rightist movement, the General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, in order to further improve the literary and artistic work of the troops, decided in April last year to send cultural work troupes (teams), writers, and directors to the company to serve as soldiers for training. This is truly a brilliant measure that brings three benefits in one stroke: it provides opportunities for members of cultural work troupes, army writers, and directors to go deep among the masses, it can greatly help carry out amateur literary and artistic activities in the company, and at the same time, it is the best opportunity for ideological transformation for members of cultural work troupes, writers, and directors. Because the professional cultural work troupes (teams) have put politics in command, their ideological level has improved, and they have gained life experience. Therefore, the programs they write and perform, whether in terms of ideological content or performance skills, have greatly improved compared to the past. Even more valuable is that the forms are diverse, with strong national flavor, many military characteristics, quick reflection of reality, and a clear idea of serving politics. The commanders and fighters of the troops no longer say that the members of the cultural work troupes are "dancing and singing, the same every day, putting on airs, and only stay in the auditorium." Now they say that they are "able to write and fight, able to go up and down, the programs are fresh, and everyone praises them." Amateur literary and artistic activities can be said to have developed unprecedentedly. Last year, I went down for a few months. In addition to watching the creations and performances of the soldiers in the company, I also watched amateur performances in three military sub-districts and two military regions. Every time I watched an evening program, I was very amazed. In general, the forms are diverse, the content is rich, there are many excellent young amateur actors, and there are many amateur talented writers.

Two Examples

We in Beijing have had interesting discussions on the combination of revolutionary realism and revolutionary romanticism. This is a beneficial discussion, and I hope it can continue in the future. But how to put it on the stage seems to still have some hesitation. When I watched the amateur performances of the troops, I was strongly impressed by the rich imagination and bold performances, which I couldn't match. Here are two examples: In late autumn last year, I watched an amateur performance in the Chengdu troops. The amateur performance team of a certain unit of our army performed a choral performance expressing the self-sacrificing spirit of our volunteer army on the Korean battlefield. When the curtain opened, the stage was full of young and lively soldiers. Because they were not often on stage, their spirits were not concentrated when they first came on stage. Some faces were red, and some were looking around aimlessly. The audience was worried that they would not sing well. However, when the chorus conductor waved his hand, the formation changed neatly, and the young soldiers stood up straight, stared their eyes, and shouted, "We fight for justice!" Then they sang loudly, and soon they introduced us into the imagination of the Korean battlefield. When we heard "Heroes emerge on the heroic position, not allowing the US imperialism to be rampant. Even if you bomb the mountains down, the heroic position cannot be lost!" a huge red flag was unfolded above the chorus. A soldier with a face full of dust, wearing a cotton military uniform with more than a dozen holes blasted by shells, held a gun in his left hand, raised three grenades in his right hand, stared his eyes, and sang a solo song under the red flag. Then, the chorus sang along, full of passion, that kind of spirit was indeed powerful like pulling up Mount Tai and the momentum of ten thousand horses galloping. The entire audience was shocked, and no one knew when they stood up, when they started applauding, or when they shed a few tears. As a result, the actors took seven curtain calls and came back twice before the audience calmed down. Another time was in January this year. I took a train from Chongqing back to Beijing. Because of motion sickness and a cold, I had to get off the train in Xi'an and stay at the Xi'an troop guest house. It was the last performance of the military region's amateur performance. I went there despite my illness, but I felt that my illness was relieved after watching it. Among the many good programs, one program was performed by a national band called "Battlefield Music." The theme was to describe a platoon of a certain unit of our army. After a cruel battle, the comrades who sacrificed were sacrificed, the seriously wounded comrades were transported away, and the soldiers repaired the damaged fortifications, preparing to wipe out the enemy again. After everything was arranged, everyone felt thirsty and hungry, and the air was a bit dull. The Party group leader said: "Comrades, let's play music, let the enemy hear that we are not only good at fighting!" So each soldier took out self-made musical instruments: artillery shell tubes, soda bottles, canned boxes, washbasins, etc., and beat them. At first, it felt a bit chaotic; after a long time, I felt that there were tens of thousands of cannons firing, which was exciting; especially the small song in the section of taking a break after the war and frequently tapping soda bottles, which really made people's hearts bloom. This program also had seven curtain calls and two encores. The above two examples are not enough to fully illustrate the booming scene of amateur literary and artistic activities in the troops, but they can show that the performances of amateur literary and artistic teams are far better than those of the past! Both the content and the skills have been greatly improved.

Be Humble and Learn

Premier Zhou said in his report: "We should encourage professional writers and artists to educate the people and satisfy the people's cultural life requirements with higher-quality works of thought and artistry through hard work. At the same time, we should actively lead the literary and artistic activities of the masses and pay attention to cultivating literary and artistic talents emerging from the working people." This is a great call from the Party and the government to our literary and artistic circles, and we also have a hundredfold confidence in making achievements to answer the Party's expectations of us. Of course, we must work hard, especially me, a person who lacks talent, knowledge, and insight. How can I not work hard? Taking the script "Soldiers of the Working People" that I recently wrote as an example, I subjectively wanted to write a better work that could reflect reality and serve politics. Because of my low political level, poor technical cultivation, and lack of life experience, it was difficult to write, and after writing, it turned out to be very different from my subjective ideas. But I still have the confidence to write, or direct. As long as I guard against arrogance and learn humbly, although I may not be able to write a script that can be worthy of the tenth anniversary of the National Day this year, I will never be a lazy person, I will never be content to be downstream. If I can't direct a good play or present a good work, I will dedicate my heart to the Party.

Denounce the Interveners

I would also like to say a few words about the British imperialism and Indian expansionist elements plotting the Tibetan rebellion and interfering in our internal affairs. Mentioning this issue makes people very indignant. Who doesn't know that when some continental regions on this earth had not yet formed a country, Tibet was our territory. Today, some people still dare to say that Tibet is an "independent country" and instigate the national scum of Tibet to engage in rebellion; they even dare to insult our great leader, which is really strange and strange! But, what is regrettable is that these intolerable strange things actually happened in India, our friendly neighboring country. Here I want to warn the expansionist elements of India: Tibet will always be the Tibet of the Chinese people. The Chinese people do not want an inch of foreign land, but they will never let others take an inch of land away. The era when imperialism manipulated the internal affairs of the Chinese people is over. The Chinese people, who have been tested in battle for a long time, have enough power to defend every inch of the motherland's land. Whoever wants to bully us is "digging earth on the head of Tai Sui," and there will be no good end! If the rebels do not lay down their weapons and abandon darkness and turn to the light as soon as possible, they will be completely and cleanly eliminated, just like the bubbles in the pond, a breath will disappear without a trace.

Committee members, comrades! Everyone comes from various work positions in the motherland, bringing a lot of valuable experience and many academically beneficial insights, giving me the best learning opportunity. I thank the Party, and I thank everyone.

Our meeting is a meeting of unity, a meeting of exchanging experiences, and a leap forward meeting for going all out to welcome the great tenth anniversary of the National Day. I wish the meeting a success and wish the comrades good health.

    解放军文艺活动百花齐放万象一新
    陈其通委员的发言各位委员：
    我衷心地拥护周总理的“政府工作报告”和李富春副总理、李先念副总理、彭真副委员长、李维汉副主席的报告。
    周总理的“政府工作报告”全面地总结了全国大陆解放以来各项工作的成就。这是马列主义在中国实践中取得伟大胜利的总结；是中国共产党和毛主席领导中国人民攻无不克、战无不胜的明证；是我们伟大的领袖毛主席领导的结果。报告除给了我无限的力量，也引起我很多回亿！我不打算在这里追溯往事，但有益的回亿，对今天的成就会更觉得可贵，对来日建设祖国的信念更强。我们的国家，虽然是地大物博人口众多，有五千年的古国文化……但在近百年来，遭到帝国主义的迫害，封建军阀的盘剥，真是刮得一穷二白。当一些工业发达的国家在用钢铁做门窗的时候，我们在乡镇上还买不到足够需用的铁钉。然而在全国大陆解放后的九年之内，无论从工业生产、农业生产、基本建设、文化教育、文学艺术、财政收支那一方面来看，都获得了惊人的成就。仅以钢产量来说，一九五八年一年中我们就生产出了一千一百多万吨，而旧中国包括日本侵略时候的东北在内，从一八九○年到一九四八年，五十九年合计的钢产量只不过七百六十万吨。我国粮食历来不够吃是事实，帝国主义曾说“中国人是永远饿肚皮的病夫”，可是我们现在不但没有向什么人伸手要过粮，而且还有余粮，那些曾经说我们吃不饱的人们，今天却怕我们向“他的市场”推销粮食。关于“病夫”我们虽不敢说不生病，但敢说在这个世界上我们是消灭蚊蝇最勇敢的人，比起那些把苍蝇老鼠养起来搞细菌战的战争贩子来，要强亿万倍。帝国主义摆布我们的时代永远地过去了，落后、穷困也将要过去了，今天的中国人民过着自由幸福的生活，成立了人民公社，正在以更大的跃进来迎接国庆十周年。这一切都是因为有了马克思列宁主义；有中国共产党和毛主席的领导；有党领导下的广大干部和广大群众的努力的结果。没有党和毛主席的领导，我们的祖国真不知道现在是个什么样儿呢！不堪设想。
    我们解放军的指战员，读了周总理的报告之后，个个心胸开朗，意志昂扬，对建设社会主义的祖国有百倍的信心。毛主席指出搞社会主义建设的时候，要工农业并举，两条腿走路，因地制宜，洋土结合，鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省……以及文艺、科学的“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针，都是马列主义在中国创造性的发展，是我们中国人民搞社会主义建设取得伟大成就的主要原因。过去的十年内战，八年抗战，打败美蒋，解放中国大陆，都是与毛主席正确的思想指导分不开的。我们因有伟大的领袖毛主席而感到自豪。
    报告中讲到的都是做到了的，对今后提出的任务我们也一定能够做到。我们军队在战争的时期指战员们常说：“只要党和毛主席指到那里，我们就打到那里”；今天，全国人民会说：只要党和毛主席说到那里，我们也就一定会做到那里。
    现在我要谈一点关于部队文艺工作的情况：
    一举三好
    十年来祖国在飞跃前进，文学艺术活动在
  “百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针指导下，已出现了生气勃勃的景象。全国如此，中国人民解放军的文艺活动也不例外，可以说是百花齐放，万象一新的了！特别是整风、反右之后，中国人民解放军总政治部为了进一步搞好部队文艺工作，去年四月里决定文工团（队）、作家、导演，到连队去当兵锻炼。这真是一举三好的英明措施，既可使文工团员、部队作家、导演有深入群众的机会，又可以大力帮助开展连队的业余文学艺术活动，同时对文工团员、作家、导演又是一个最好的思想改造机会。专业的文工团（队）由于政治上挂了帅，思想水准提高了，有了生活，因此写出、演出来的节目，无论是思想内容，或表现技巧都比过去大大地提高了一步。更可贵的是形式多样，民族风味浓，部队特点多，反映现实快，为政治服务的思想明确。部队的指战员再不说文工团员是“跳跳唱唱，天天一样，架子满大，专在礼堂”了，现在则说是“能文能武，能上能下，节目新鲜，人人夸他”，业余文艺活动可以说是空前的发展了。去年我下去了几个月，除在连队里看了战士们的创作和演出之外，还看了三个军分区、两个大军区的业余会演，每看一个晚会的节目都使我十分惊叹。总起来说是形式多样，内容丰富，优秀的青年业余演员众多，业余的天才作家不少。
    试举二例
    我们在北京曾津津有味的讨论革命的现实主义与革命的浪漫主义相结合的问题，这是有益的讨论，希望今后能继续；但怎样行之于舞台，似乎还有缩手缩脚之感。我在看部队业余演出之时，给我强烈的印象则是想象丰富、表演大胆，乃我所不及。试举二例：去年秋末在成都部队看业余演出，有我军某部业余演出队，演出表现我志愿军在朝鲜战场上舍身成仁的大合唱。幕拉开，台上站满了年轻活泼的战士，因他们不常上舞台，刚上台精神不集中，有的脸发红，有的在东张西望无所适从，观众有人耽心他们唱不好；可是，当那个合唱指挥把手一挥的时候，队形哗地一下变整齐了，年轻的战士挺着胸，瞪着眼，一声喊：“我们为正义而战！”随之高歌，不久就把我们引入朝鲜战场的想象。当我们听到“英雄的阵地上出英雄，不让美帝来逞凶，那怕你炮轰大山倒，英雄的阵地不能丢！”的时候，在合唱队的头顶上空展开了一面巨大的红旗，一个满脸尘垢、身穿被炮弹炸破了有十余个洞的棉军衣的战士，他左手持枪，右手高举三个手榴弹，瞪着眼睛，站在红旗之下放声独唱一曲之后，合唱队随之合唱，激情充沛，那种气概确有力拔泰山、万马奔腾之势。全场听众被震动了，谁也不知道什么时候站起来的，什么时候开始鼓掌的，在什么时候掉下了几滴眼泪的。结果是演员谢幕七次，重来二次，观众才安静下来。又一次是今年一月，我从重庆乘火车返北京，因晕车、伤风而得小恙，只好在西安下车，住西安部队招待所。时值军区业余会演最后一场，我带病而去，却有一看病轻之感。在很多好节目之中，有一个节目是民族乐队演出的，名叫“战场乐”，主题是描写我某个部队的一个排在一场残酷的战斗之后，牺牲的同志牺牲了，重伤的同志运走了，战士们修补了打坏的工事，准备再次的歼灭敌人。一切安排停当之后，大家觉得口渴肚饿，空气有些沉闷，党的小组长说：“同志们，我们来奏乐吧，让敌人听听，我们还不仅是会打仗呢！”于是每个战士拿出自制的乐器：炮弹筒、汽水瓶、罐头盒、洗脸盆等，敲打起来。开始，觉得乒乒乓乓有些零乱；久之，则感到有万炮齐发，动人心魄；特别是那曲战后小憩，频敲汽水瓶之一段小曲，真使人心花怒放。这个节目也是七次谢幕，两次重演。以上这两个例子并不足以全部说明部队业余文艺活动的蓬勃景象，却能说明业余文艺团队的演出远非他日能比了！无论是内容、技巧，都有很大提高。
    虚心好学
    周总理在报告中说：“我们应当鼓励专业的文学家、艺术家，经过艰苦的努力，用思想性和艺术性更高的作品来教育人民群众，满足人民群众的文化生活要求。同时，应当积极地领导群众的文学艺术活动，注意培养从劳动人民中涌现出来的文学艺术人才。”这是党和政府对我们文学艺术界的伟大号召，我们也有百倍的信心做出成绩来回答党对我们的期望。当然是要努力的，特别是我，才、学、识三方面都缺乏的人，不努力怎么行呢。拿我最近写的剧本“劳动人民的战士”来说，主观上想写出能反映现实、为政治服务的较好的作品来，因为政治水准低、技巧修养差、生活缺乏，写时难，写后看来与主观想法大不一致。可是我还是有信心写，或者导演。只要力戒骄傲，虚心好学，今年我虽然不一定写得出能够配得上为国庆十周年献礼的剧本来，但我决不做懒汉，决不甘居下游，导不出好戏，献不出好作品，我把心献给党。
    斥干涉者
    我还想说几句关于英帝国主义和印度扩张主义分子，策动西藏叛乱，干涉我国内政的事。一提到这个问题，就使人非常愤慨，谁不知道当这个地球上某些大陆地区还没有形成一个国家的时候，西藏就是我们的领土。今天居然还有人敢说西藏是“独立国”，并唆使西藏的民族败类搞叛乱；居然敢侮辱我们伟大的领袖，真是怪而又怪啊！但，可叹的是这些不可容忍的怪事情竟出在我们邻友之邦的印度。在这里我要警告印度的扩张主义分子们：西藏永远是中国人民的西藏，中国人民不要任何外国一寸土地，但是也决不让别人抢走一寸土地。帝国主义摆布我们中国人民内政的时代过去了，久经战斗考验的中国人民有足够的力量保卫祖国的每寸土地，谁想来欺侮我们，那是在“太岁头上动土”不会有好下场的！叛乱分子若不及早放下武器弃暗投明，就将被彻底、干净的消灭，就像水塘里的水泡一样，吹口气就会无影无踪。
    各位委员、各位同志们！大家来自祖国各地的各个工作岗位，带来了很多宝贵的经验，和很多学术上有益的见解，给了我一个最好的学习机会，我感谢党，感谢大家。
    我们的大会，是团结的大会，是交流经验的大会，是为迎接伟大的国庆十周年而鼓足干劲的跃进大会。我敬祝大会成功，祝同志们的身体健康。
