\tCoordinated Scientific Research
\tShaanxi Scientific Units Overcome More Than Ten Key Research Projects in Production

\t(Our reporter Zhang An'nan) reported: The Shaanxi Provincial Science Committee has organized scientific research departments, universities, and research institutions in factories and people's communes to strengthen collaboration and conduct complete scientific research, so as to develop science rapidly, effectively, and economically.

\tAccording to incomplete statistics, since November of last year, this coordinated research method has been used for more than 30 scientific research projects, with a total of twelve projects completed. Most of these are major national construction projects. For example, the Shaanxi Provincial Acoustics Research Institute and Xi'an Normal University jointly developed a 750-watt ultrasonic drilling machine. This drilling machine vibrates 25,000 times per second and can drill and cut hard and brittle materials such as diamonds, making it suitable for precision machining. Researchers from the Xi'an Semiconductor Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, Northwest University, Shaanxi State Cotton Factory No. 6, and the Sediment Analysis Research Office of the Northwest Engineering Bureau of the Yellow River Conservancy Commission cooperated to develop photoresistors using indigenous methods. Its sensitivity is very high. Using it to install circuits can greatly simplify the lines, and it can also be used to control cotton roll uniformity and analyze sediment content in water. The Shaanxi Provincial Chemical Industry Research and Design Institute collaborated with farmer Zhang Junxian to develop a wheat thresher. Its threshing capacity reaches 2,000 jin per hour, which is equivalent to the work of nine laborers and four livestock for one day. These research results have been put into production. Currently, more than 20 key research projects are underway, including new types of tractors, cotton stalk pulling machines, deep plows, and water lifting machinery.

\tSince the Great Leap Forward, scientific research in Shaanxi has flourished and achieved great results. In the past year alone, five scientific branches and sixty-six scientific research institutes have been established, and people's communes and factories have also established thousands of research offices and groups. They have successfully researched many major national construction projects, and these research results have played an active role in production. However, due to insufficient coordination between research units and dispersed research, phenomena such as incomplete research results and duplication of research topics have occurred. To this end, the Shaanxi provincial leadership has proposed a new method of coordinated research to carry out scientific research. The specific approach is to form a collaborative research group for each research project, consisting of relevant scientific research departments. Then, according to the strengths of each collaborative unit, jointly negotiate and determine the research tasks of the unit. Utilizing the existing equipment and personnel of each collaborative unit, various scientific research tasks are quickly carried out.

\tThe implementation of this coordinated approach can achieve results in a timely manner. For example, the new type of tractor research project was organized by the Shaanxi Provincial Agricultural Machinery Bureau to research supporting components. The Shaanxi Agricultural Machinery Research Institute provides opinions on the adaptability and styling of tractors and agricultural machinery to various parts of Shaanxi, Jiaotong University designs the engine, Northwest Agricultural College and Maoling Agricultural Machinery School jointly design the chassis, and Xi'an Agricultural Machinery Factory designs the universal chassis and attached agricultural implements. This mutual cooperation and joint research avoids the phenomenon of incomplete research results in the past and can be put into production immediately. At the same time, the tactic of "annihilation warfare" can be used to concentrate firepower and focus on key research projects, so as to quickly complete the key projects in current production. For example, in order to meet the needs of this year's close planting of wheat, the Shaanxi leading organization organized farmer special researcher Liu Hengjie and the Shaanxi Agricultural Machinery Research Institute, Northwest Agricultural College and other units to work together to carry out crash research on the modification of small animal-powered wheat harvesters. In the process of cooperative research, Liu Hengjie, based on this year's dense wheat plants, thick branches and high stalks, proposed speeding up the speed changer and other opinions. The Shaanxi Provincial Agricultural Machinery Research Institute rushed to draw design drawings, Northwest Agricultural College transferred personnel to participate in the design, and provided books, materials and equipment for trial production. With this mutual collaboration and all-out effort, the new wheat harvester was researched in just half a month. If the past method of dispersed research were used, it would take at least half a year to complete. After field trials, it was proved that this simple structure, easy to manufacture harvester is very flexible to use, and can harvest wheat with a yield of 600 to 800 jin per mu. In addition, after the implementation of the coordinated method, the collaborative units have both research departments and production departments, which is convenient to fully consider the materials and equipment problems during production in the design process. For example, in the process of participating in the design of 330,000-volt magnetic-blast lightning arresters, the Xi'an Switch Rectifier Factory, based on the existing equipment and materials in the factory, proposed to use substitutes and indigenous methods to solve the problem of extinguishing arcs in the pole pieces, so as to ensure the smooth progress of the trial production work. The researchers adopted this suggestion for design, and as a result, it took only forty-five days to complete the two-year trial production task.

### 协作配套开展科学研究  陕西各科学单位攻破生产上十多个重点研究项目

    协作配套开展科学研究
    陕西各科学单位攻破生产上十多个重点研究项目
    本报讯　记者张安南报道：陕西省科学工作委员会组织各科学研究部门、高等院校和工厂、人民公社的研究机构加强协作，进行成套的科学研究，多快好省地发展科学事业。
    据不完全统计，从去年11月到现在，已用这种协作配套的研究办法进行了三十多项科学研究，已完成的共有十二个项目，其中大多是国家建设的重大项目。如陕西省应声学研究所与西安师范学院共同研究制成了七百五十瓦超声波钻床。这种钻床每秒钟震动二万五千次，能钻切金刚石类又硬又脆的物质，可供精密机械加工之用。中国科学院西安半导体研究所和西北大学、陕西国棉六厂、黄河水利委员会西北工程局泥沙分析研究室等单位的研究工作人员，互相配合，用土法研究制成了光敏电阻。它的灵敏度很高，用它装置电路可以大大地简化线路，还可以用光敏电阻控制棉卷均匀率和分析水中泥沙含量等。陕西省化学工业研究设计院与农民张俊贤协作制成了小麦脱谷机。它的脱粒量每小时达二千斤，等于九个劳动力、四头牲畜一天的工作量。这些研究成果已先后投入了生产。目前，正在研究的还有：新型拖拉机、拔棉柴机、深耕犁、提水机械等二十多个重点研究项目。
    大跃进以来，陕西科学研究工作蓬勃发展，成绩很大。仅去年一年，就建立五个科学分院、六十六个科学研究所，各人民公社和工厂还建立了上千个研究室、组。他们成功地研究了许多国家建设的重大项目，这些研究成果已在生产中发挥积极的作用。但由于各研究单位之间配合不够，分散研究，发生过研究成果不成套、研究课题重复等现象。为此，陕西省领导部门，提出新的协作配套的办法来进行科学研究。具体作法是：对每一个研究项目，都找有关的科学研究部门组成一个协作研究组。然后，根据各协作单位的特长，共同协商确定本单位的研究任务。利用各协作单位的现有设备和人员，很快地开展了各项科学研究工作。
    实行这种协作配套办法后，可以及时地取得成效。如新型拖拉机研究项目，就是由陕西省农业机械局组织各方面的力量来研究配套的。陕西农业机械研究所提供拖拉机及农机具对陕西各地的适应性和造型的意见，交通大学设计发动机，西北农学院和茂陵农业机械学校共同设计底盘，西安农业机械厂设计万能底盘及附带农具等，这样互相配合共同研究，避免了过去研究成果不成套的现象，可以马上投入生产。同时，可以用打“歼灭战”的战术，集中火力，主攻重点研究项目，迅速地完成当前生产上的关键项目。例如，为适应今年小麦密植的需要，陕西领导机构便组织农民特约研究员刘恒杰和陕西农业机械研究所、西北农学院等单位通力合作，突击研究改制小型畜力割麦机。在合作研究过程中，刘恒杰根据今年小麦株密枝粗秆高的情况，提出加快转速器等意见，陕西省农业机械研究所赶绘设计图纸，西北农学院抽调人员参加设计，并提供了图书资料和试制的设备。这样互相协作、全力以赴，仅仅半月的时间，就把新的割麦机研究出来了。若用过去分散研究的办法，至少需要研究半年才能告成。经过田间试验证明：这部结构简单，制造容易的割麦机使用很灵便，可收割亩产六百至八百斤的小麦。另外，实行协作配套办法后，协作单位既有研究部门，又有生产部门，便于在设计的过程中充分考虑到生产时的材料和设备问题。如西安开关整流器厂在参加三十三万伏磁吹避雷器设计过程中，就根据厂里现有的设备和材料，提出用代用品和土办法来解决极片不灭弧等问题，以保证试制工作顺利进行。研究人员采纳了这一建议进行设计，结果仅用四十五天时间，就完成了二年的试制任务。
