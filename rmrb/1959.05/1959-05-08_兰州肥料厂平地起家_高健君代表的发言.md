Comrades Delegates:

　　I fully agree with the Government Work Report made by Premier Zhou Enlai, the reports of Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen. The people of all nationalities in Gansu unanimously support the central government’s policy and measures for handling the Tibetan rebellion. The pacification of the Tibetan rebellion not only safeguarded the unity of the motherland and the solidarity of nationalities, and thoroughly crushed the conspiracies of foreign aggressors and Tibetan rebels, but will also promote the smooth realization of social reforms and national regional autonomy in Tibet, enabling the Tibetan people to be liberated from the most barbarous and dark feudal serf system, gain the right to be masters of their own affairs, and move towards a bright and happy new life.

　　1958 was also a year of all-round leap forward in Gansu, and unprecedented achievements were made on all fronts. The leap forward in industry was even greater, truly forming a situation of "one horse taking the lead, and ten thousand horses galloping." In this year, the total industrial output value of the province increased by one and a half times compared with 1957. A significant feature of the great leap forward in Gansu industry last year was that, under the guidance of the policy of the whole party and the whole people running industry, small and medium-sized local industrial factories and mines have developed greatly. This is of particular importance for changing the poorer and blanker face of Gansu and gradually realizing the industrialization of the communes. Among the thousands of newly built small and medium-sized factories and mines, the Lanzhou Fertilizer Plant, which serves agricultural production, has attracted widespread attention like a gorgeous flower. Although this is a small factory with a small output value, its growth process points out the way for us to develop local industry in the Gansu region in a faster, better and more economical way.

　　The Lanzhou Fertilizer Plant was founded in February 1958 by the Chengguan District of Lanzhou City. In the beginning, there were only three cadres and eleven handicraft workers, all of whom were "outsiders" to the fertilizer industry. There was no capital, only more than 80,000 yuan borrowed from the handicraft cooperative. Apart from this, there was only a desolate beach and twenty-odd earthen houses prepared to be the site of the factory. Even the pot for the employees to cook was borrowed. Under such circumstances, in a short period of time, by the end of 1958, the factory already had 700 employees, 270,000 yuan of fixed assets and 1.73 million yuan of circulating funds, eight workshops and a laboratory, six machines, and was able to produce 28 kinds of chemical fertilizers, chemical raw materials and pharmaceutical products such as antibiotic fertilizers, potash fertilizers, naphthalene acetic acid, bacterial culture media, naphthalene alum, and anhydrous ethanol, becoming a comprehensive chemical plant with an initial scale. In 1958, the factory overfulfilled its production plan, with an output value of 2.57 million yuan, and its products were sold to many provinces and regions. The income for this year, after deducting expenses, debts, and retained funds, also turned over 300,000 yuan of profit to the state. Three-quarters of the factory's workers are housewives who have just been liberated from heavy housework. After a short period of training, they have learned technology, improved their culture, and made outstanding achievements in production.

　　Why was the Lanzhou Fertilizer Plant able to start from scratch empty-handed?

　　The policy of running enterprises diligently and thriftily, and relying mainly on self-reliance, has taken root, blossomed and borne fruit in the Lanzhou Fertilizer Plant. In the early stage of the factory's construction, there were many difficulties. There was no capital, no equipment, and no technology. There were inconsistencies in understanding what methods to use for construction. At that time, the three cadres had two opinions. One advocated that the state invest 220,000 yuan to first build the factory buildings, buy equipment, and put it into production after completion, and the state should also supply the raw materials; the other advocated self-reliance, starting from scratch, from small to large, producing and constructing at the same time. Two cadres wanted to retreat and requested to be transferred to other jobs, suggesting that this "dirty and smelly" and unpromising factory be given to others. The construction work of the factory almost came to a standstill. The district committee understood this situation and, on the one hand, established a party organization in the factory, and on the other hand, handed the matter over to the masses, leading the masses to speak out freely. After repeated debates, the latter opinion finally prevailed, and the situation suddenly changed. With a direction, there is strength, and there is a way. First, use the garbage and feces of Lanzhou City to make compost. After having income, gradually increase the products. In this way, production developed day by day, and the factory grew day by day on the desolate beach. This vivid process has profoundly educated all the employees of the factory. From their own practice, from positive experience and negative lessons, they have realized that only diligence and thrift can start a business, and self-reliance is the only way out; as long as you are full of energy and strive for the top, even if you are empty-handed, you can create miracles by relying on ordinary labor.

　　Using two legs to walk, relying on one's own hands, using indigenous methods before foreign ones if foreign ones were not available, using waste materials first if raw materials are unavailable, being simple and crude, making use of local materials, and serving all for the purpose of supporting agriculture and supplying social needs - the Lanzhou Fertilizer Plant carried out production and construction under the guidance of this idea. If there was no pulverizer, donkeys were used to pull the stone mill; if there was no distillation tower, gasoline drums were used to modify it; if there was no cement, ceramics were used; if there was no air compressor, bellows, leather bellows, and air pumps were used. Garbage is very annoying, and Lanzhou City has hundreds of tons to deal with every day. They used it to make fertilizer, which not only improved the urban environment, but also turned the useless into useful and supported agricultural production. Hair seems to be useless, but they use it to produce cystine, chromin, and other products. They built a 150-square-meter alcohol workshop in three days and put it into production on the fifth day. The 30-meter chimney was built by digging a ditch using the terrain slope and building it around with bricks. This not only saved more than 10,000 bricks, but also built a house on top of it, which became a greenhouse for growing vegetables in winter. They produce granular fertilizer, but if there is no ammonium nitrate, they look for substitutes. If local saltpeter is not good, brine is not good, and sludge has not been tried, they finally tried using the waste oil from the soap factory. This is really "poor people have poor ways." A big-character poster written by a worker said it well:

　　Fertilizer factory, really rare, many things are unusual;
　　No machines, no equipment, a few small earthen houses, can produce;
　　The chimney is eight or nine feet high, but you can't see it; indigenous methods are on the horse, and 300,000 are turned over to the state.

　　Now, the Lanzhou Fertilizer Plant already has some simple mechanical equipment and is developing in the direction of combining foreign and indigenous methods. When the first machine arrived at the factory, the workers jumped up with joy: "We also have machines!" From this machine, the workers saw more clearly the development prospects of their factory.

　　If you don't understand, learn, and if you learn, do it. The workshop is the school, and talents emerge from the masses. The Lanzhou Fertilizer Plant used this method to overcome technical hurdles. There was a demobilized soldier in the factory who studied medicine and served as a teacher at the spare-time technical school. He used the method of teaching as he learned to give lectures to everyone. The employees also learn while doing, often holding Zhuge Liang meetings to study technical problems in production together. Leaders and workers study together, workers and farmers study together, ask books for advice, ask scientific research institutions for advice, and also send people to study inside and outside the province. Nothing is difficult in the world, as long as you have the will to do it. In this way, they learned the necessary technology through hard study and cultivated many technicians. Ma Tai, who used to be a felt maker, was initially a little timid about technology. He said: "I'm not afraid of anything else, I'm just afraid of technology." But, slowly, he was no longer afraid. Not only did he learn general technology, but he also learned how to repair electric motors. Now he is the director of the bacterial workshop. With the continuous improvement of technology, new products are constantly increasing, and advanced products such as caustic soda, sulfuric acid, silver nitrate, tannic acid protein, and cystine have also been successfully trial-produced and put into production. These facts show that as long as you work hard, you can also start from scratch in technology, from small to large, from layman to expert. The technical hurdle is not unbreakable.

　　The combination of leaders and the masses, the combination of cadres and workers, working together with one heart and one mind, and pooling the wisdom of the masses is also more prominent in the Lanzhou Fertilizer Plant. The factory leaders share all plans and tasks with the employees, and difficulties are also handed over to the masses for discussion. Everyone is united, and everyone is of one mind. They disclose the bottom line to the masses, not just a little, leaving a little, but deeply, thoroughly, and completely. The 1958 plan was completed 15% over the target after being discussed by the masses, who came up with ideas and solutions. It is particularly worth mentioning that the factory has only more than 20 management personnel, accounting for 3% of the total number of employees. There is not a single full-time cadre in the workshop. Cadres participate in labor, workers participate in management, everyone discusses things, and everyone does things. This has become a common practice. In the minds of the employees of the Lanzhou Fertilizer Plant, the mass line is by no means an abstract concept, but a source of wisdom and strength.

　　Exposing problems, launching debates, unifying understanding, and resolving contradictions are the main factors that enable the Lanzhou Fertilizer Plant to move forward continuously. Here, the party's core leadership plays a decisive role. The party organization of the factory does not adopt an evasive attitude towards all problems, but boldly hands them over to the masses for discussion. By doing so, it not only solves problems, but also improves understanding. For example, in September last year, production in the factory improved, debts were paid off, and there was some surplus. At this time, some cadres thought that the factory had already made money, it was going well, and it was time to take a break. The party organization discovered this problem and immediately launched a debate among the masses. As a result, the momentum of production not only did not slacken, but became greater and greater. New products were added, ensuring the overfulfillment of the annual plan. The methods used by the party organization to educate the employees are also rich and colorful. Every time a new product is made and a new workshop is put into production, an on-site meeting is held in the workshop. The factory's praise and criticism are also discussed by the masses. The most meaningful thing is to organize the factory workers to visit their own factory. This is a review for the old workers, and they become more and more motivated; for the new workers, it is the most moving practical education. Continuous revolution in thought can guarantee continuous leap forward in production. This is an important experience of the Lanzhou Fertilizer Plant.

　　Striving for greater progress, the Lanzhou Fertilizer Plant's output value plan for this year is 12 times higher than last year, and the number of products has increased to 41. New products that have been successfully trial-produced include 10 types such as anhydrous sulfuric acid, silver nitrate, tannic acid protein, and cystine. The production plan for the first quarter has been overfulfilled. All employees of the factory are working hard with full confidence to complete and overfulfill this year's plan.

　　The Lanzhou Fertilizer Plant has only been established for more than a year now. It is in the process of growing, and everything needs to be further consolidated and improved. Adhering to the policy of running enterprises diligently and thriftily, relying mainly on self-reliance, and carrying forward the spirit of hard work, practical work, and skillful work are the prerequisites for ensuring the continuous development of the Lanzhou Fertilizer Plant.

　　My speech is just to elicit valuable opinions. If there is anything inappropriate, please correct me, delegates.

### 兰州肥料厂平地起家  高健君代表的发言

专栏：

　　兰州肥料厂平地起家
    高健君代表的发言各位代表：
    我完全同意周恩来总理的政府工作报告，李富春、李先念副总理和彭真副委员长的报告。我们甘肃各民族人民，一致拥护中央人民政府处理西藏叛乱事件的方针和措施。西藏叛乱的平息，不仅维护了祖国统一和民族团结，使外国侵略者和西藏叛乱分子的阴谋彻底破产，而且将促进西藏社会改革和民族地方自治的顺利实现，使西藏人民从最野蛮黑暗的封建农奴制度下面解放出来，获得当家作主的权利，走向光明幸福的新生。
    一九五八年，在甘肃也是全面跃进的一年，各个战线上都取得了前所未有的成就。在工业方面的跃进更大，真正形成了“一马当先、万马奔腾”的局面。这一年，全省工业总产值比一九五七年增长了一倍半。去年甘肃工业大跃进中的一个显著特点，就是在全党全民大办工业的方针指导下，中小型地方工业厂矿有了很大的发展。这对于改变甘肃更穷更白的面貌和逐步实现公社工业化，有着特别重要的意义。在新建的成千上万个中小型厂矿中，为农业生产服务的兰州肥料厂，就像瑰丽的花朵，引起了人们广泛的注意。这虽然是个产值不大的小型工厂，但是它的成长过程，为我们指出了在甘肃地区多快好省地发展地方工业的道路。
    兰州肥料厂，是在一九五八年二月由兰州市城关区创办的。最初的时候，只有三个干部和十一个手工业工人，他们对于肥料这一行全都是“门外汉”。没有资金，只从手工业合作社借来了八万多元。除此而外，就只剩下准备做厂址的一片荒滩和二十几间土房了。连职工做饭的锅都是借来的。就在这样情况下，经过短短的时间，到一九五八年底，这个工厂已经拥有七百个职工，二十七万元固定资金和一百七十三万元流动资金，八个车间和一个化验室，六部机器，能够生产抗生菌肥料、钾肥、萘乙酸、细菌培养剂、萘矾、无水乙醇等二十八种化学肥料、化工原料和医药用品，成为一个初具规模的综合性化工厂。一九五八年，这个工厂超额完成了生产计划，产值达到二百五十七万元，产品销到许多省区。这一年的收入，除过开支、还债和自留资金，还给国家上缴三十万元的利润。这个工厂的工人，四分之三是刚从繁重的家务劳动中解放出来的家庭妇女，经过短时间的培养，学会了技术，提高了文化，并且在生产上做出了出色的成绩。
    兰州肥料厂为什么能够赤手空拳平地起家呢？
    勤俭办企业，自力更生为主的方针，已经在兰州肥料厂生根、开花、结果。建厂初期，困难重重，一无资金二无设备三无技术，到底用什么办法来进行建设，认识是不一致的。当时三个干部就有两种意见。一种主张国家投资二十二万元，先修厂房，买设备，建成以后再投入生产，原料也要国家供应；一种主张自力更生，从无到有，从小到大，一边生产，一边建设。两个干部又想打退堂鼓，要求调动工作，建议把这个“又脏又臭”又没前途的厂子让给别人去干。建厂工作几乎陷于停顿。区委了解了这个情况，一方面在厂内建立了党的组织，一方面把底子交给群众，领导群众大鸣大放，经过反复辩论，后一种意见终于占了上风，局面也就顿然改观。有了方向，就有了力量，也就有了办法。先利用兰州市的垃圾和粪便制造堆肥，有了收入之后，又逐渐增加产品，这样，生产就一天天发展，厂子也就在荒滩上一天天成长起来了。这个生动的过程，使全厂职工受到了深刻的教育。他们从自己的实践中，从正面的经验和反面的教训中认识到，只有勤俭才能起家，自力更生才有出路；只要鼓足干劲，力争上游，即便赤手空拳，也能依靠平凡的劳动创造出奇迹。
    用两条腿走路，靠一双手办事，没有洋的，先用土法，没有原料，先用废物，因陋就简，就地取材，一切为支援农业和供应社会需要服务，兰州肥料厂就是在这个思想指导下进行生产和建设的。没有粉碎机，就用毛驴拉碾子；没有蒸馏塔，就用汽油桶改装；没有水泥，就用陶瓷；没有空气压缩机，就用风箱、皮老虎、打气筒。垃圾是很令人讨厌的，兰州市每天就有几百吨需要处理。他们用来制造肥料，既改善了城市环境卫生，又变无用为有用，支援了农业生产。头发看来也是无用，他们却用来生产出胱氨酸、铬氨酸以及其它产品。一百五十平方公尺的酒精车间，他们三天建成，第五天投入生产。三十公尺的烟囱，是利用地形坡度挖了一道沟，周围用砖一砌就成功了。不但节省一万多块砖，而且在上边盖了房子，成为冬天种菜的温室。他们生产颗粒肥料，没有硝酸氨，就找代用品，土硝不行，卤水不行，污泥也没有试成，最后用肥皂厂的下脚油试成了。这真是穷有穷办法。工人写的一张大字报说得好：
      肥料厂，真稀罕，许多事儿不一般；
      没机器，没设备，几间小土房，就能搞生产；
      烟囱八九丈，就是看不见；土法上了马，上缴三十万。
    现在，兰州肥料厂已经有了一些简单的机械设备，正朝着洋土结合的方向发展。当第一部机器到厂的时候，工人们高兴得跳起来：“我们也有机器了！”从这部机器的身上，工人们更清楚地看到了自己工厂的发展前途。
    不懂就学，学会就干，车间就是学校，群众里面出人才。兰州肥料厂就是用这个办法攻破技术关的。厂内有一个复员军人是学医的，担任业余技术学校的教员，他用现学现教的办法给大家讲课。职工也是边干边学，经常开诸葛亮会，在一起研究生产中的技术问题。领导和工人一起研究，工人和农民一起研究，向书本请教，向科学研究机关请教，还派人到省内外学习。天下无难事，只怕有心人，就在这样刻苦钻研中学会了必要的技术，并且培养出了不少技术人员。原来是一个制毡工人的马泰，最初对技术有些胆怯，他说：“别的不怕，就怕技术”。但是，慢慢的，他不怕了，不但学会了一般技术，连电动机也会修理了，现在他担任着细菌车间主任。随着技术的不断提高，新产品不断增加，高级产品如烧碱、硫酸、硝酸银、鞣酸蛋白、胱氨酸等，也先后试制成功并投入生产。这些事实说明，只要艰苦努力，在技术上同样也可以从无到有，从小到大，从外行到内行，技术关并不是牢不可破的。
    领导和群众结合，干部和工人结合，同心同德，群策群力，这在兰州肥料厂也是比较突出的。厂的领导把一切计划任务都同职工群众见面，困难也交给群众去讨论，上下一股劲，大家一条心。他们给群众交底，不是交一点，留一点，而是交深、交透、交全。一九五八年的计划，就是经过群众讨论，大家出主意，想办法，才超额百分之十五完成的。特别值得提出的是这个工厂的管理人员只有二十多人，占职工总人数的百分之三。车间里没有一个脱产干部。干部参加劳动，工人参加管理，有事大家商量，大家动手，已经蔚为风气。在兰州肥料厂的职工心目中，群众路线决不是什么抽象的概念，而是智慧和力量的源泉。
    揭露问题，展开辩论，统一认识，解决矛盾，这是兰州肥料厂能够不断前进的主要因素。这里，党的核心领导，是起决定作用的。工厂的党组织，对于所有问题不是采取回避的态度，而是大胆地交给群众去讨论，这样做，既解决了问题，又提高了认识。例如去年九月，厂里生产有了起色，还清了债，还有一些盈余。这时候，有的干部认为，厂子已经赚出了，能行了，该歇一歇了。党组织发现了这个问题，立刻在群众中进行辩论，结果生产劲头不但没有松下去，而且愈来愈大，增加了新产品，保证了全年计划的超额完成。党组织向职工进行教育的方法，也是丰富多采的。每一种新产品制成，一个新车间投入生产，就在车间开现场会。对工厂的表扬和批评，也都让群众讨论。最有意义的是组织本厂工人参观自己的工厂。这对于老工人来说，是温故知新，愈干愈有奔头；对于新工人来说，更是最动人的实际教育。思想上的不断革命，才能保证生产上的不断跃进，这是兰州肥料厂的一条重要经验。
    百尺竿头，更进一步，兰州肥料厂今年的产值计划比去年增加十二倍，产品增加到四十一种，已经试制成功的新产品，有无水硫酸、硝酸银、鞣酸蛋白、胱氨酸等十种。第一季度的生产计划已经超额完成。全厂职工满怀信心地为完成和超额完成今年的计划而努力。
    兰州肥料厂从成立到现在，才不过一年多时间。它正在成长的过程中，一切都有待于进一步地巩固和提高。而坚持勤俭办企业、自力更生为主的方针，发扬苦干实干巧干的精神，则是保证兰州肥料厂不断发展的前提。
    我的发言只是抛砖引玉，如有不妥，请各位代表指正。
