On the Eve of the Geneva Conference
By Our Correspondent Pan Fei

The Foreign Ministers' conference between the East and West is about to open in Geneva on May 11th. Thanks to the efforts of the Soviet Union, the German Democratic Republic, and all peace-loving countries, the Geneva conference provides a possible avenue for resolving the most pressing international issues of the moment – the German peace treaty and the West Berlin problem. However, forces in Western countries seeking to obstruct the relaxation of the international situation, led by U.S. imperialism, are sparing no effort to set up various obstacles to the Geneva conference. They want to ensure the Geneva conference achieves nothing, in order to block the path of consultation and continue the Cold War.

From the very first day the Geneva conference was determined to be held, the United States began "preparing" in two ways. On the one hand, it poisoned the European situation, dispelling the atmosphere of consultation. Some warmongers in the United States have recently made incessant hawkish remarks; U.S. aircraft, disregarding Soviet warnings, have flown more than once to West Berlin via the eastern airspace of the German Democratic Republic at altitudes above seven thousand meters; and the United States has recently been actively promoting its plan to widely establish rocket bases in Western Europe. According to the Pentagon's timetable, rocket and missile bases will be established in West Germany within the next three months. A month ago, Washington and Rome signed an agreement to establish U.S. intermediate-range missile bases in Italy and supply Italy with rockets, and the first batch of "Jupiter" missiles will be shipped to Italy before July 1st. Plans to establish rocket bases in the Netherlands, Greece, and Turkey are also actively underway. When the Geneva conference is about to be held and the United States has also expressed its willingness to consider a German peace treaty, it is rushing to arm West Germany with missiles and rockets. Isn't the motive of the United States very obvious?

The other "preparation" work of the United States is to "unify" the steps of Western countries and bring its allies into the American framework.

It is known that since Macmillan's visit to the Soviet Union, Britain, based on its own interests and in order to enhance its international standing, has expressed some opinions on certain international issues that are not entirely consistent with those of the United States. According to official and semi-official British statements, it can be seen that: 1. Britain advocates continuing to hold summit meetings of major powers regardless of the outcome of the Foreign Ministers' conference; 2. On the Berlin issue, Britain hopes to reach a "new arrangement" through consultation with the Soviet Union on the so-called "old legal basis" to ensure the existing status and rights of the United States, Britain, and France in West Berlin; 3. Britain tends to recognize the status quo in Eastern Europe to some extent, attempting to use this as a bargaining chip when negotiating with the Soviet Union; 4. On the issue of European security, Britain has put forward the Macmillan plan to "freeze" or "reduce" armaments in Central Europe. The United States, in addition to stating that the holding of a summit meeting should depend on whether the Foreign Ministers' conference makes "progress," firmly opposes Britain's second, third, and fourth points. Of course, this disagreement is only a tactical disagreement. Western newspapers call Britain's attitude "flexibility within toughness," while the U.S. attitude is "toughness within flexibility." It can be seen that there is no essential difference between the opinions of the United States and Britain. However, even if this is merely a tactical disagreement, in order to achieve the goal of obstructing the relaxation of the international situation, the United States has recently either directly put pressure on Britain, or instigated and encouraged West Germany to counterattack Britain, forcing Britain to abandon its own主張. Sure enough, Britain retreated step by step: It repeated the cliches of unifying Germany through "free elections"; it revised Macmillan's plan to "freeze" armaments into first establishing a so-called supervisory system and then considering the "control" or "restriction" of armaments. In this situation, the so-called "package plan" based on the U.S. opinion was finally finalized at the Western Foreign Ministers' conference at the end of April. This plan will be submitted to the Geneva Foreign Ministers' conference as the "suggestion" of Western countries.

The Western countries have kept the content of the "package plan" secret. However, according to newspaper disclosures, it is roughly: 1. Before the reunification of Germany, the status of Berlin will not be changed, and Western countries will not give up their "rights" in West Berlin. 2. Emphasize not giving up "free elections" to unify Germany. If the Soviet Union agrees to this principle, a pan-German committee can be established to formulate election laws. The members of the committee are produced in proportion to the population to ensure that West Germany has a majority. 3. On the issue of European security, first establish a supervisory system. Only after Germany has conducted "free elections" will further implementation of the so-called "control" or "restriction" of armaments be carried out. If the content disclosed by the newspapers is generally correct, then it can be seen that the United States intends to entangle several issues together in order to obstruct the rational solution of the Berlin issue and delay the signing of a German peace treaty. According to Western news agencies, this "package" suggestion is designed to force the Soviet Union to either solve them together or not solve them at all. This is an old tactic that the United States has used as early as a few years ago. Times are advancing, and the international situation is developing. In this regard, U.S. decision-makers have lost the most basic sense of time.

In the communique of the Warsaw meeting, the foreign ministers of the Warsaw Treaty Organization and the People's Republic of China urged all countries participating in the East-West Foreign Ministers' conference to make efforts for the success of this conference. The Geneva conference can fully make its due contribution to easing the international situation. Anyone who wants to obstruct, slack off, or sabotage will only isolate themselves in front of the people of the world.

### 日内瓦会议前夕

　　日内瓦会议前夕
　　本报记者　潘非
    东西方外长会议5月11日就要在日内瓦开幕了。由于苏联、德意志民主共和国以及所有爱好和平国家的努力，日内瓦会议为解决当前最紧迫的国际问题——对德和约和西柏林问题，提供了可能的途径。但是，西方国家中力图阻挠国际局势缓和的势力，以美帝国主义为首，正不遗余力地为日内瓦会议设置种种障碍。它们要使日内瓦会议一事无成，以便堵塞协商的道路，继续进行冷战。
    从确定召开日内瓦会议的第一天起，美国就从两方面来进行“准备”工作。它一方面毒化欧洲局势，驱散协商气氛。美国的一些黩武分子，最近不断发表好战言论；美国飞机也不顾苏联警告，不止一次地在七千公尺以上的高空，经由德意志民主共和国的东部领空飞往西柏林；美国在最近更积极推行它在西欧广泛建立火箭基地的计划。根据五角大楼的时间表，在最近三个月内，将在西德建立火箭和导弹基地。一个月以前，华盛顿和罗马签订了在意大利建立美国中程导弹基地，以及供应意大利火箭的协议，第一批“丘辟特”导弹也将在7月1日前运往意大利。在荷兰、希腊和土耳其建立火箭基地的计划，也在积极进行中。当日内瓦会议即将召开、美国也表示同意考虑对德和约的时候，它却急急忙忙地要用导弹和火箭把西德武装起来。美国的动机何在，不是十分明显吗？
    美国另一方面的“准备”工作，是“统一”西方国家的步调，把它的盟国纳入美国的框子之中。
    人们知道，自从麦克米伦访问苏联以后，英国从它本身的利益出发，以及为了提高自己的国际地位，在某些国际问题上，表示了一些同美国并不完全一致的意见。根据英国官方和半官方的言论，可以看出：一、英国主张不论外长会议的结果如何，应继续召开大国最高级会议；二、在柏林问题上，英国希望通过同苏联的协商，在所谓“旧的法律基础上”，作出一种“新的安排”，以确保美英法在西柏林的现有地位和权利；三、英国倾向于在某种程度上承认东欧现状，企图以此作为同苏联谈判时讨价还价的本钱；四、在欧洲安全问题上，英国提出了在中欧“冻结”或“减少”军备的麦克米伦计划。美国除了表示最高级会议的召开应取决于外长会议是否获得“进展”以外，对英国的第二、三、四项，坚决反对。当然，这种分歧只是策略上的分歧。西方报纸把英国的态度称为“在灵活中求强硬”，美国的态度则是“在强硬中求灵活”，由此可见，美国和英国的意见，谈不到有什么本质上的区别。但是，即使这仅仅是策略上的分歧，为了达到阻挠国际局势和缓的目的，在最近以来，美国或者是直接对英国施加压力，或者是唆使和鼓励西德出来反击英国，迫使英国放弃自己的主张。果然，英国步步后退：它重复通过“自由选举”统一德国的陈词滥调；它把麦克米伦的“冻结”军备计划修改成先建立所谓监督制度，然后考虑限制军备的东西。在这种情况下，以美国意见为蓝本的所谓“一揽子计划”，终于在4月底的西方外长会议上被最后定案了。这个计划将作为西方国家的“建议”，提交日内瓦外长会议。
    西方国家对“一揽子计划”的内容，一直秘而不宣。但是根据报纸的透露，它大体上是：一、在德国统一以前，不改变柏林的地位，西方国家将不放弃在西柏林的“权利”。二、强调不放弃“自由选举”来统一德国。如果苏联同意这一原则，即可建立全德委员会，制定选举法。委员会的成员按人口比例产生，以保证西德占有多数。三、在欧洲安全问题上，先建立监督制度。只有在德国进行了“自由选举”之后，才进一步实施所谓军备的“控制”或“限制”。如果报纸透露的内容大体不错的话，那末可以看出，美国是打算把几个问题纠缠在一起，以阻挠柏林问题的合理解决，拖延对德和约的签订。根据西方通讯社的说法，这种“一揽子”的建议就是为了迫使苏联要末一起解决，要末不解决。这是美国早已在几年以前就运用过的老策略。时代在前进，国际形势在发展。在这方面，美国的决策人丧失了最起码的时间观念。
    华沙条约缔约国和中华人民共和国外长在华沙会议的公报中，敦促所有参加东西方外长会议的国家，都应为这一会议的成功作出努力。日内瓦会议完全可以为和缓国际局势作出应有的贡献。谁想阻挠、怠工或破坏，结果只是在全世界人民面前使自己孤立。
