Bashan and Shushui, Railways Crossing Vertically and Horizontally

When you take a train across the Qinling Mountains and see the towering peaks and rugged mountain roads, you will surely relive Li Bai's poem: "The road to Shu is difficult, more difficult than ascending to the blue sky." No wonder Deng Ai, a general of the Wei Kingdom, led his troops into Shu in the past, and the soldiers cried because the road was difficult to travel. Throughout history, many "heroes and heroines" could only sigh in the face of the difficult Shu Road. In the past, the Qing Dynasty, the Northern Warlords, and the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang successively shouted for more than 40 years to build railways in Sichuan, but they never laid a single rail. However, in less than ten years after liberation, under the leadership of the Communist Party, the people of Sichuan built the Chengdu-Chongqing and Baoji-Chengdu railways, and started the construction of four major trunk lines from Neijiang to Kunming, Chengdu to Kunming, and the Sichuan-Guizhou and Sichuan-Henan lines. At present, the mileage of railways open to traffic reaches more than 1,300 kilometers, and more than 1,500 kilometers of new lines are under vigorous construction. After these railways are completed, Sichuan will form a comprehensive railway transportation network, and the abundant products of the "Land of Abundance" can flow more quickly throughout the country.

    巴山蜀水  铁路纵横
    当你乘坐列车跨过秦岭的时候，看见高耸入云的群峰，崎岖难行的山道，一定会重温李白的诗句：“蜀道之难，难于上青天”。难怪昔日魏将邓艾引兵入蜀，士兵因路难行而哭泣。历史上多少“英雄豪杰”只能面对着难行的蜀道感叹。过去清朝、北洋军阀、蒋介石匪帮接连叫喊四十多年要在四川修铁路，始终没有铺上一根钢轨。但是，解放不到十年，四川人民在共产党的领导下，就修成了成渝、宝成两铁路，并且动工兴建从内江到昆明、成都到昆明和川黔、川豫四大干线。目前通车运输的里程达一千三百多公里，还有一千五百多公里新线正在大力建设。这几条铁路建成后，四川便形成了四通八达的铁路运输网，“天府之国”丰富的物产就可以更快地畅流全国了。
