Yinchuan, May 12th (From Our Newspaper) – Recently, in Jinji County, Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, people's communes, production brigades, and production teams (smaller teams) have signed "Three Guarantees" contracts (guaranteeing work, output, and financial responsibility), ensuring the implementation of production plans, boosting commune members' confidence, and greatly increasing their work enthusiasm.

Before signing the contracts, commune and team cadres, along with experienced farmers, conducted thorough investigations into the basic situation of all labor, livestock, farm tools, and cultivated land area. Through bottom-up discussions, they pooled the wisdom of the masses to formulate production plans, enabling each commune member to have a clear understanding of their tasks, responsibilities, and measures. At the same time, the contracts clearly stipulated that the brigade would supply the smaller teams with consumable means of production, providing material guarantees and specifying when supplies would be provided. If delays caused a reduction in the smaller team's production, the brigade would be held responsible. The contracts also specified the production targets for grain and cash crops that the smaller teams were responsible for, with all surplus production being distributed to the commune members, thus encouraging their production enthusiasm. Regarding financial responsibility, the contracts clearly stipulated the proportions for production management fees, public accumulation, public welfare funds, and commune members' personal income, giving commune members a clear understanding and placing financial work under the supervision of the masses.

The development of each team's production was uneven; therefore, in signing the "Three Guarantees" contracts, the principle of "to each according to his work, more work more gain" was strictly implemented. For example, the fourth and eighth teams of the Ximen Brigade in the Shuangzha Commune had similar labor forces, but the eighth team had approximately three times more land than the fourth team. The eighth team had more work and needed support from the fourth team. This contradiction was resolved after the contracts were signed. The eighth team, with more land, earned more work points and higher incomes, while the fourth team, with less fieldwork, organized its labor to help the eighth team in addition to engaging in sideline occupations organized by the brigade, with the eighth team paying them according to their labor days. This ensured the simultaneous leap forward of both teams, satisfying the commune members of both teams.

After signing the "Three Guarantees" contracts, the production enthusiasm of the commune members was even higher. Communes and teams organized labor to find fertilizer sources everywhere. Some traveled dozens of miles to the mountains to haul sheep manure, while some women went to the Qingtongxia construction site on the Yellow River in the middle of the night to collect manure. Local fertilizer factories were busy day and night applying large amounts of fertilizer to wheat production, ensuring that the wheat seedlings grew vigorously and healthily. Recently, cold waves have frequently struck, and commune members, fearing damage to the wheat seedlings, started fires on the field ridges to smoke the seedlings. In addition to their determination to cultivate the basic farmland well, they also planted various crops on the lake beaches and roadsides, striving for higher yields. (Xie Shiyan)

Chengdu, May 12th (From Our Newspaper) – The universal implementation of output contracts to smaller teams in Taiping Commune, Jintang County, Sichuan Province, has powerfully promoted current production activities.

In order to fully mobilize the enthusiasm of the most basic production units for running communes diligently and thriftily, the Taiping Commune, based on the suggestions of the vast majority of cadres and commune members, stipulated that in addition to management districts contracting output to the commune and production teams contracting output to the management districts, the method of smaller teams contracting output to the production teams was also implemented (a smaller team consisting of about thirty households, and a production team consisting of more than one hundred households). The commune also mobilized the masses to conduct in-depth discussions, stipulating specific methods for smaller team output contracts, closely integrating unified leadership with tiered management. In early April, the commune led all 280 smaller teams in contracting output to the production teams.

Currently, according to the commune's regulations, each smaller team has planted various crops on more than 95% of the cultivated land according to the production team's plan, and planted vegetables and fodder crops on 3%-5% of the reserve cultivated land. This ensures that the needs of the state, the collective, and the commune members are taken into account, and that the state plan is implemented on each plot of land in accordance with local conditions. After the implementation of output contracts to smaller teams, commune members generally felt that the success or failure of production was more closely related to them. They conducted "field soil consultations," dividing the paddy fields and dry land on mountains, dams, and hills into twenty-two types of soil, and arranging various crops on the soil best suited for their growth. The first smaller team of the fourth production team in the fourteenth cultivation area also discussed and determined the specific methods for implementing the "Eight-Character Charter" for each field based on different field characteristics and cultivation conditions. For example, for "cold-soaked fields" where the soil temperature is low and tillering is difficult, they planted medium-season rice and planted it more densely. In terms of fertilizer, seeds, water, and management, they also determined a series of specific practices for "cold-soaked fields," such as applying more thermal fertilizers; for fertile "oily sandy fields," selecting fertilizer-resistant varieties such as "Ma Zhan"; and for "shallow mud fields," weeding the seedlings twice more, so that measures were implemented. In addition to planting vegetables and fodder crops on the "reserve cultivated land" stipulated by the commune, in order to further increase the income of the smaller team, they also used idle land to plant one or two hundred nests of gourds, beans, or sweet potatoes and corn per person. According to statistics for the most recent week, since the implementation of output contracts to smaller teams, due to the fact that they have been selling fresh vegetables to commercial departments and the canteen (one canteen per smaller team) retains the selected leftover vegetables, this item alone has generated more than 900 yuan in income. This income has been used by the smaller teams to develop livestock and poultry breeding. From the beginning of April to the present, each smaller team has raised 26,000 chickens and more than 300 pigs. The supply of non-staple foods on the market has also been increasing.

After the implementation of output contracts to smaller teams, manpower and materials are relatively fixed, and the division of labor is more reasonable. Over the past month, each smaller team has further reviewed and improved the division of labor between main labor and auxiliary labor, and between production personnel and non-production personnel. The labor force on the front line of spring plowing and summer harvesting has rapidly increased from about 70% in March to 83%. This has laid the foundation for labor cooperation. Each smaller team has recently transferred a large part of its labor force to participate in drought resistance and transplanting of medium-season rice and other major agricultural work under the unified dispatch of the management district, ensuring that the planned area for rice is fully planted and transplanted, and that the smaller team itself has enough manpower to take care of the early rice field management work.

According to the commune's regulations, in addition to turning in some public accumulation funds, most of the surplus production of the smaller teams is distributed to the commune members. This has further mobilized the enthusiasm of all the smaller teams. Commune members said: "Which smaller team sweats the most will taste the greatest sweetness." Smaller teams with a better production base and a higher level of awareness proposed higher goals, and the teams with a relatively poor foundation, accounting for about one-third, also quickly launched a wave of "learning from the advanced and catching up with the advanced."

    小队包产  计划落地  干劲冲天
    金积各公社大队与生产队签订三包合同社员劳动更加积极
    金堂县太平公社各生产小队包产后劳动力的安排更加合理
    本报银川12日电  最近，宁夏回族自治区金积县各人民公社生产大队和生产队（小队），通过签订三包（包工、包产、包财务）合同，使生产计划落实，社员心中有数，劳动积极性更加高涨。
    在签订合同之前，社队干部和老农，对所有劳力、牲畜、农具、耕地面积等基本情况，进行了调查研究；并通过自上而下的讨论，集中群众智慧，制订了生产计划，使每个社员心中有底，熟悉任务，明确责任，清楚措施。同时，在合同中明确地规定了大队供给小队消耗性的生产资料，提供物质保证，并规定何时供应，如误了时间引起小队减产，应由大队负责；也规定了乙方承受的粮食和经济作物的生产任务，超产部分全部分配给社员，鼓励了社员的生产积极性。在包财务方面，合同中明确规定了生产管理费、公共积累、公益金、社员个人所得的比例，这样社员心中有底，并使财务工作置于群众监督之下。
    各队生产的发展是不平衡的，因此，在签订三包合同时，都严格地贯彻了按劳分配、多劳多得的原则。例如双闸公社西门大队四队和八队，劳动力相近，而土地亩数八队比四队大约多了三倍，八队活多，需要四队支援，订合同后，就解决了这个矛盾。地多的八队，工分订得多，收入也多；而四队田里活少，除大队搞副业外，就组织人力去八队帮工，八队按劳动日付给报酬。这样，保证了两个队同时跃进，两个队的社员都很满意。
    签订三包合同之后，社员的生产劲头更加高涨。各社队都组织劳力，到处寻找肥源。有的到几十里外的山上拉羊粪，有的妇女半夜到黄河青铜峡工地拾大粪，各队土化肥厂日夜忙着给小麦生产大量追肥，保证麦苗长得茂盛、茁壮。最近，时时有寒流袭击，社员们怕冻坏麦苗，就在田埂上生火熏苗。他们除了决心种好基本农田外，还在湖滩地、路边地种植各种作物，争取多打多收。  （谢石言）
    本报成都12日电  四川金堂县太平公社生产小队普遍实行包产，有力地推动了当前的生产活动。
    太平公社为了充分调动最基层生产单位勤俭办社的积极性，根据绝大多数干部和社员的建议，除规定管理区向社包产、生产队向管理区包产以外，还实行了小队向生产队包产的办法（小队三十户左右，生产队一百多户）。公社还发动群众深入讨论，规定了有关小队包产的具体做法，使统一领导和分级管理密切结合，并在4月初，领导全社二百八十个小队向生产队包产。
    目前，各小队已根据社里的规定，用95％以上的耕地按照生产队的计划种植了各种作物，用3％—5％机动耕地种植了菜蔬、饲料等作物。这样，便做到国家、集体、社员的需要统筹兼顾，使国家计划在因地制宜的基础上落实到每一田块。各小队实行包产以后，社员们普遍感到生产搞得好坏跟自己的关系更加密切了，纷纷进行“田土会诊”，把本队分布在山地、坝地、丘陵上的水田和旱地划分出二十二种田性，分别将各类作物安排在最适宜生长的土质上。十四耕作区第四生产队第一小队还根据不同的田性和耕作条件，讨论确定了每一块田实行“八字宪法”的具体做法。例如，“冷浸田”地温低、不易分蘖，他们便种植中稻并栽得密一些。在肥、种、水、管等方面，他们也分别确定了“冷浸田”多施热性肥料；肥沃的“油砂田”选用耐肥的品种
  “麻粘”；“浅泥田”要多薅两道秧子等一系列的具体做法，使措施落实。另外，各小队除了在社里规定的“机动耕地”上种植了菜蔬、饲料等作物外，为了进一步增加小队的收入，还利用空闲土地，每人种了一两百窝瓜、豆或红薯、玉米等。据最近一周的统计，各小队实行包产以后，由于纷纷把新鲜菜蔬卖给商业部门，食堂（每个小队一个食堂）留用选剩的菜蔬，仅这一项便收入了九百多元。这笔收入已被各小队用来发展家畜家禽，自4月初到现在，各小队添养了二万六千只鸡、三百多头猪。市场上的副食品也日益增多了。
    小队实行包产以后，人力物力较为固定，分工也更加合理。近一个月来，各小队进一步检查改善了主要劳力与附带劳力、生产人员与非生产人员的分工状况，春耕夏收第一线上的劳动力已由3月的70％左右迅速增加到83％。这样，就使劳动力的协作有了基础，各小队在最近都抽调很大一部分劳动力，在管理区统一调度下参加抗旱栽插中稻等主要农活，保证水稻按计划面积满栽满插，小队本身的早稻田间管理工作也有足够的人力照管。
    根据公社规定，小队超产部分除上缴一些公积金以外，大部分都分配给社员。这样，便进一步调动了所有小队的积极性。社员们说：“哪个小队汗水滴得最多，哪个就能尝到最大的甜味。”原来生产基础较好、队员觉悟较高的小队提出了更高的奋斗目标，约占三分之一的基础较差的队也迅速掀起了“学先进、赶先进”的热潮。（王焕斗）
