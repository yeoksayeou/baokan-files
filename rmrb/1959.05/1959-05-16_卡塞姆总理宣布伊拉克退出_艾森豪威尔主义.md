Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, May 14th: Prime Minister Qasim announced on the 14th that the Republic of Iraq was withdrawing from the Eisenhower Doctrine.

    The Prime Minister said at a meeting of the Iraqi Federation of Industries, "We decided this week to withdraw from the Eisenhower Doctrine because we do not want to be part of an aggression agreement. We do not want to be partners with countries that attack other countries."

    Prime Minister Qasim emphasized twice in his speech, "We announce to the world that we are friends of communist countries. I will personally try to develop this friendship."

    Prime Minister Qasim said that we are also friends of Western countries that hope to have our friendship. This is the attitude that a neutral country should have.

    Prime Minister Qasim also announced that Iraqi women will participate in government work, which is a first in the history of the Arab East. He said, "There will be women serving as cabinet members in the next cabinet."

    Prime Minister Qasim called on Iraqi national capitalists to actively invest in the development of the national economy, and said to them, "You should work to strengthen the national economy. The state takes it as its task to manage heavy industry for a certain period of time. But light industry is your field of activity."

    Prime Minister Qasim said, "We are a neutral country working for the interests of our people and for strengthening and defending the current regime of the country. The absolute power of this country belongs to the people, to the republic. No foreigner shall interfere in the management of this country."

    He also said, "We are working to establish a true democratic base so that we and our neighbors can benefit from it. As for those who conspire against us while we are busy fighting against imperialism, they will encounter a difficult period of accounting for their actions to history. We forgive them and let history judge them. But those who shed tears for Iraq and say that communism dominates Iraq should cry for themselves."

    Prime Minister Qasim announced that Iraq is a sovereign and independent country, a member of the United Nations, and has sufficient troops to defend itself. He said, "We will use this army to maintain peace, not to use it for aggression."

    Qasim pointed out that Iraq, as a neutral country, will benefit its neighbors. He said that Turkey and Iran are also included in these neighboring countries. It would be better for them if their neighbors were peaceful and neutral countries.

    Prime Minister Qasim reiterated that he personally encourages freedom and free organization of trade unions, and encourages freedom of expression. He reminded his listeners not to be self-important, not to be arrogant and dizzy with victory. He said, "We are still at the beginning of our journey. We have many tasks and many difficulties ahead of us, but we will overcome these difficulties with the strength of the people."

    Prime Minister Qasim believes that "the time is not yet ripe to organize political parties." He said, "When the time is ripe, I will personally encourage the organization of such parties."

    卡塞姆总理宣布
    伊拉克退出“艾森豪威尔主义”
    新华社巴格达14日电　卡塞姆总理在14日宣布伊拉克共和国退出艾森豪威尔主义。
    这位总理在伊拉克工业总联合会会议上说，“我们本星期决定退出艾森豪威尔主义，因为我们不想成为侵略协定的一部分。我们不想做攻击他国的国家的伙伴。”
    卡塞姆总理在讲话中两次强调说，“我们向全世界宣布，我们是共产主义国家的朋友。我将亲自设法发展这种友谊。”
    卡塞姆总理说，我们也是希望得到我们友谊的西方国家的朋友。这是中立国家应当有的态度。
    卡塞姆总理还宣布，伊拉克的妇女将参加政权工作，这在阿拉伯东方史上是第一次。他说，“将有妇女担任下届内阁的阁员。”
    卡塞姆总理号召伊拉克民族资本家积极为发展国民经济进行投资，并且向他们说，“你们应当为加强国民经济而努力。国家在一定时期把经营重工业当作自己的任务。但是轻工业是你们的活动场所。”
    卡塞姆总理说，“我们是为自己的人民的利益、为加强和保卫国家的现政权而努力的中立国家。这个国家的绝对权力是人民的，是共和国的。任何外国人不得插手管理这个国家。”
    他又说，“我们在为建立真正的民主基地而努力，以便我们和邻国可以从中得到好处。至于那些在我们忙于进行反对帝国主义的斗争的时候阴谋反对我们的人，他们将遇到向历史交代他们的行动的困难时期。我们原谅他们，让历史对他们作出审判。但是那些为伊拉克而流泪，并且说什么共产主义支配着伊拉克的人还是为自己哭泣好”。
    卡塞姆总理宣布，伊拉克是主权独立的国家，它是联合国会员国，有足够的军队来保卫自己。他说，“我们将用这种军队来维持和平，而不是用它来侵略。”
    卡塞姆指出，伊拉克作为一个中立国，将使它的邻国得到好处。他说，土耳其和伊朗也包括在这些邻国中。如果它们的邻国是和平中立的国家，那对它们就更好了。
    卡塞姆总理重申，他个人鼓励自由和自由组织工会，鼓励自由发表意见。他提醒他的听众不要自以为了不起，不要自高自大和为胜利冲昏头脑。他说，“我们还是处在旅程的起点。我们有许多任务，面前有许多困难，但是我们将用人民的力量克服这些困难。”
    卡塞姆总理认为，“组织政党的时候还没有成熟。”他说，“当时机成熟的时候，我将亲自鼓励组织这种政党”。
