Tirana, May 29th (by our correspondent) – With the continuous development of socialist construction, the ranks of the Albanian working class are growing daily. At present, there are more than 140,000 workers in the country, nearly five times more than before liberation. In the past, Albanian women rarely participated in industrial labor, but today, Albania has more than 35,000 female workers, which is 40% more than the total number of workers before liberation.

Under the leadership of the Albanian Labor Party and the trade unions, Albanian workers have become the true masters of the country. They have contributed their strength and wisdom to the socialist construction of the motherland. In 1958, the workers overfulfilled the annual industrial production task by 101.6%, and this year they completed the first quarter's production task by 104.1%. In 1958, the rationalization proposals put forward by the workers increased by 31% compared with 1957, saving the state more than 170 million lek (Albanian currency).

In order to rapidly increase production, friendly socialist emulation and rationalization proposal movements have been launched between enterprises and workshops throughout Albania. At present, the challenge put forward by the young workers of the Stalin Textile Factory to strive for the title of "Fifteenth Anniversary of Liberation Group" has been responded to by more than 300 workshop groups. 70-odd percent of the country's drivers have launched a campaign for safe driving of 100,000 to 300,000 kilometers.

Due to outstanding creations or achievements, twenty-one workers have now been awarded the title of Socialist Labor Hero.

With the development of production, the material and cultural welfare of the workers has been continuously improved. In 1958, the actual wages of workers increased by 6%. At the same time, the increase in party and state expenditures for free medical care, free vacations, and housing subsidies for construction workers, as well as the continuous reduction of prices, have brought enormous benefits to the vast number of workers. In 1958, the state built 157,000 square meters of new housing for workers, more than 7,000 workers and peasants received long-term state loans for building houses, and 11.8% of workers' children enjoyed free vacations. According to statistics, there are already 106 libraries for workers, with more than 140,000 books, and 577 art groups.

    阿尔巴尼亚工人阶级队伍空前壮大
    积极展开竞赛迎接解放十五周年
    本报地拉那29日电　随着社会主义建设事业的不断发展，阿尔巴尼亚工人阶级的队伍正日益壮大。目前，全国已有十四万多工人，比解放前增加了近五倍。在过去，阿尔巴尼亚妇女很少参加工业劳动，但今天，阿尔巴尼亚已有三万五千多名女工，这比解放前的工人总数还要多40％。
    阿尔巴尼亚工人在阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和工会的领导下已成为国家的真正主人。他们为祖国的社会主义建设事业贡献出了自己的力量和智慧。1958年，工人们超额101.6％完成了年度工业生产任务，今年又以104.1％完成了第一季度的生产任务。1958年，工人们提出的合理化建议比1957年增多了31％，为国家节约了一亿七千多万里克（阿币）。
    为了迅速地提高生产，阿尔巴尼亚全国各地的企业之间和车间之间都展开了友谊的社会主义竞赛和合理化建议运动。目前，由斯大林纺织工厂青工提出的争取获得“解放十五周年小组”称号的挑战已获得了三百多个车间小组的响应。全国70％几的司机展开了安全行驶十万一三十万公里的运动。
    由于杰出的创造或成就，现在已有二十一位工人荣获了社会主义劳动英雄的称号。
    随着生产的发展，工人的物质文化生活福利得到了不断的提高。1958年，工人的实际工资增长了6％。同时，党和国家用于公费医疗、公费休假和建筑工人住宅补贴费用的增加，以及不断降低物价，更给广大工人带来了巨大的利益。1958年，国家为工人建造了十五万七千平方公尺的新住宅，七千多工人和农民得到了国家的造屋长期贷款，11.8％的工人子弟享受了公费休假。据统计，为工人举办的图书馆已有一百零六个，藏书十四万余册，艺术小组有五百七十七个。
