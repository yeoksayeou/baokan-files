Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 14th: Eisenhower, at a press conference held on the 13th, attacked the Soviet Union for using the East-West Foreign Ministers' Conference as a "propaganda platform" and glossed over the US policy towards the Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference. When asked by reporters how he assessed the Soviet Union's "tactics" in the opening days of the conference, he replied that it seemed there was indeed a purpose in using the negotiations as a "propaganda platform."

His statement is believed to refer to the Soviet Union's struggle over the issue of the conference member states. It is generally believed that the Soviet Union put the West in a very passive and embarrassing position at the beginning of the conference.

Eisenhower said: "For ourselves, we have always been eager to conduct any negotiations that could be called fruitful, avoiding using such negotiations as a propaganda platform, or merely as a means of repeating our or anyone else's views to the world."

He also said, "I very much hope that we can now quickly find a way to get rid of some of these things and embark on fruitful negotiations on those issues that both sides consider important."

Eisenhower did not say what "fruitful negotiations" he hoped for, but Western news agencies revealed that the United States, together with West Germany, France, and Britain, was preparing to present a so-called "package plan" at the conference, intending to obstruct the settlement of the German peace treaty and the West Berlin issue with a method of talking about everything and resolving nothing.

When talking about the issue of banning nuclear tests, Eisenhower emphasized that "any restrictions on inspection must meet the needs stipulated by scientific data," and said that "you cannot state or stipulate the necessary number of these inspections until all factors have been studied." He said: "I am completely unable to estimate what agreement will be reached (on the issue of stopping nuclear tests), or what agreement will not be reached."

When talking about domestic issues in the United States, Eisenhower could not hide his concern about the difficulties and contradictions facing the American economy and politics. At the meeting, Eisenhower appealed to Congress, capitalists, and trade unions to find ways to stop the trend of rising prices and inflation in the United States. He expressed his intention to immediately write to both houses of the US Congress, asking them to increase appropriations for highway construction and housing construction to avoid more worker unemployment, and urging them to take emergency measures to deal with the US "surplus" wheat problem. He said that the current accumulated "surplus" wheat in the United States has reached a total value of 3.5 billion US dollars. If measures are not taken immediately, this situation will continue to deteriorate. This will be a dangerous "disaster" for the United States.

    艾森豪威尔给美国政策搽粉
    攻击苏联在日内瓦会议上的严正立场
    新华社14日讯　华盛顿消息：艾森豪威尔在13日举行的记者招待会上攻击苏联利用东西方外长会议作为“宣传讲台”，并且为美国对日内瓦外长会议采取的政策涂脂抹粉。他在记者问到如何估计苏联在这个会议的开头几天的“策略”时回答说，在这次会议中，似乎的确有把谈判作为“宣传讲坛”的一种目的。
    他的这一说法被认为是指苏联在会议成员国的问题上进行的斗争而言的，一般认为，苏联在会议一开始就使西方处于十分被动狼狈的地位。
    艾森豪威尔说：“就我们自己来说，我们一直都很渴望举行可能称做有成果的任何谈判，避免把这种谈判作为宣传讲坛，或是仅仅作为向全世界重复我们的或任何别人的看法的手段。”
    他还说，“我非常希望我们现在能够很快设法摆脱一些这样的东西，而着手就双方都认为是重要的那些问题进行有成果的谈判。”
    艾森豪威尔没有说他希望的“有成果的谈判”是什么，但是西方通讯社透露的消息说，美国准备同西德、法国、英国一起在会上提出一个所谓“一揽子计划”，打算用什么都谈、什么都不解决的办法来阻挠对德和约和西柏林问题的解决。
    艾森豪威尔在谈到关于禁止核试验问题时，强调“对视察的任何限制都必须符合科学资料规定的需要”，并且说在“就一切因素加以研究之前，你不可能说明或规定这些视察必需的数目”。他说：“我完全无法估计（在停止核试验问题上）会取得什么协议，或者不会取得什么协议”。
    艾森豪威尔在谈到美国国内问题时，掩盖不住他对美国经济、政治面临的困难和矛盾的忧虑。艾森豪威尔在会上向国会、资本家和工会呼吁，要它们设法制止美国物价高涨和通货膨胀的趋势。他表示打算立刻写信给美国国会两院，要它们增加建设公路和修建住宅的拨款以避免更多工人失业，并催促它们采取紧急措施来对付美国“剩余”小麦问题。他说，美国目前积存的“剩余”小麦总值已达三十五亿美元。假如不马上采取措施，这种情况会继续恶化下去。这将是美国一场危险的“灾难”。
