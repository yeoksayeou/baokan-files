　　On my trip to Anhui, what inspired me most was that in our beautiful land, on the fertile earth, people are using unparalleled energy and unrestrained will to create brilliant pictures of life. I will now present one of them to the readers.

　　Heroic Mountains, Heroic People

　　Here are pine forests and bamboo forests like ocean waves. We followed the increasingly steep and narrow mountain terrain, twisting and turning, into a river valley of the Dabie Mountains. The spring sun made the azaleas as red as blood droplets, and the spring breeze brought the fragrance of orchids. Suddenly, we climbed to the top of a ridge, and looking ahead, a vast expanse of white Shi River, sandwiched between two towering peaks, revealed a towering, gray-white dam standing majestically in front of the river. This is the arch dam of the Meishan Reservoir. I stood in front of this man-made giant mountain and lake. I couldn't help but exclaim: "What a solemn palace!" I call it a "palace" because it was created by sacred labor, and I call it a "palace" because it marks a brilliant new era for the Dabie Mountains. On rainy nights, the pearl-like, bright lights on the top of the dam gently sway on the river surface; in the morning light, the power lines on the high架 are like shining silver threads. If you listen carefully, isn't the roar of the power station a song of today's happy life? If you think about it carefully, doesn't this bright light also contain the sparkle of our heroic history?

　　I have no intention of dwelling in front of the high dam of the Meishan Reservoir, but I know that the Meishan area was called "Red City" in the Soviet era - it is this red city! It gives me a major inspiration and allows me to see the soul of the Dabie Mountains. Stand on the top of that mountain and look around: mountain peaks connect to mountain peaks, mountain ranges overlap mountain ranges. The huge mountains of the Dabie Mountains! Like an eagle about to spread its wings and fly high, it stretches one wing towards Henan and the other towards Hubei. Here, every piece of land, every rock, forever exudes the aura of heroism. Because such people live in the mountains, once they accept the spark of truth, even if they die, they will pass on a heart of unwavering integrity to their descendants. Here, listen to the heartfelt words of Zhang Shangwen, a loving mother, a kind wife, and a loyal and steadfast guerrilla fighter!

　　"...The environment for struggle became even more difficult. One day, we were eating wild vegetables in the mountains, and he (Zhang's husband, Wang Laiying, the leader of the guerrilla team) was on guard, monitoring the enemy. Unexpectedly, the enemy came from behind, and they were all mobilized from Mapu, Nanxi, Jinzhai, and Dingbu... When we heard the gunfire so close, we ran into the mountains. A large number of enemies were chasing after us without delay. The enemies were getting closer and closer, and it seemed impossible to escape... Everyone looked up and saw a pool of water halfway up the mountain, covered with dry lotus leaves. People jumped in one after another and hid under the water, covering their heads with dry lotus leaves. I hugged my child and jumped in too. It was the middle of winter, and the water was icy cold. I gritted my teeth, but the baby, who had not been born long, started crying... The enemy cavalry was about to rush in front of us. If they found out, wouldn't all the comrades be in danger? At this time, I knew: if I wanted the child, I couldn't have the comrades; if I wanted the comrades, I couldn't have the child... I hardened my heart and pressed my own child under the water... My child kept shaking and struggling in the water, but what could I do? I could only grit my teeth... My heart ached terribly - it was bleeding... I watched like a dead person as the horses galloped past, filled with hatred and pain, I really wanted to shout and shoot!... Everyone climbed out and looked at the child who died on the ground, speechless, with tears in their eyes. An old comrade said: 'Shangwen! What are you doing? Let's all die together!...' He couldn't go on. - I sat on the ground looking at my child and fainted. The comrades saved me to the mountain, lit a fire to warm me, and slowly dried me. It took me a long time to wake up, but when I opened my eyes, my husband was not in front of me. When I asked the comrades, I learned that he had been captured by the enemy. What could I do! I fainted again. One day, someone came back from the street and said they had seen my husband's 'crimes,' and said he had been sentenced to death. When I heard this, my heart was cut like a knife, and the comrades were all furious, and they all wanted to storm the execution ground. But that was a dead end. I leaned against a pine tree, closed my eyes, and said to everyone: 'Comrades! We can't do this, we can't destroy everyone for one person, we who are alive must continue to fight!...'..."

　　Now every word Zhang Shangwen speaks is recorded in the pages of the revolutionary memoirs of Jinzhai County. But is this just Zhang Shangwen's story? No, this is the story of the Dabie Mountains. This is my first time to the Dabie Mountains, and I didn't want to bring up the tragic past of this valley. But when I see all this and hear all this, I can't help but think of the slanders of the Dulles and others against our Great Leap Forward. While we are enthusiastically building our happy life, they say that we are "using slave labor on a large scale" and "building a huge slave state." Yes, we are people who have fought our way out of blood and fire. We not only know what a slave is, but we also know how to crush the imperialism's enslavement of the people. History is always educating us, and the tragic past constantly gives us strength; it is precisely the people who have gone through the storm who are today, on our own land, advancing with unparalleled ease and enthusiastic steps. Not only today, but tomorrow as well, and no one can stop it.

　　The Disappearance of an Old City and the Birth of a New City

　　I don't want to engage in personal discussion here, but on my way to visit the People's Commune, I have to take the time to talk about how an ancient Jinzhai County disappeared from the ground and how a brand-new Jinzhai County was born on the ground.

　　I took a small motorboat across the "Meishan Reservoir" and carefully tasted the interest of "high gorges emerge into peaceful lakes." However, here, it is more like a peaceful strait than a lake. The reservoir is more than a hundred miles in diameter from north to south, and all around are steep mountains, covered with forests of bamboo trees, lush and green. A waterfall like a white silk falls from the high rock top, and the emerald green lake reflects the flame-like red azaleas. The boat winds along the lake surface, and the reservoir provides a shipping route to the deep mountainous area of the Dabie Mountains.

　　People spread out the map of Jinzhai County and pointed it out to me: the areas of Wudian, Huanglong, and Nanxi in front are all battlefields for large-scale steelmaking. In the light of fire and smoke, people left behind such verses: "Dense furnace groups surpass the stars, heroes are busy day and night, and watch the fiery tongue dance, each furnace produces thousands of tons day and night," "Good scenery under the Dabie Mountains, soil furnaces for steelmaking are arranged in rows, the flames from each furnace rise to the sky, and the rolling molten iron surpasses the Yangtze River." Now, long bamboo rafts are constantly winding along the lake, fully loaded with newly refined iron blocks.

　　Such things often happen in life, when you haven't had time to think carefully about the world in front of you, a sentence suddenly opens your eyes. Now, my young friend Hong Jingliang helped me in this way. One moment he pointed to me: "The small grass houses that used to be bent into have all been submerged. Look, those rows of blue brick and tile houses on the hillside are all newly built by the government." Another moment he told me: "When I was a child, I groped around in the river, and there were only small stick fish the length of my fingers. Now how many fish are there in this reservoir! Soon, we Jinzhai County will have an average of 500 catties of fish per person!" In short, everything revealed from his heart is new life, joy, like the morning light. We passed through the Lion's Mouth Gorge, the mountains gradually moved away, and the lake surface was as flat as a mirror. And Hong Jingliang became even more excited. He pointed to the front and said to me: "We are now over the old Jinzhai County." Hong Jingliang's former residence has long been submerged in the lake. An old city is gone, and by the Meishan Reservoir, along the banks of the Shi River, a brand-new Jinzhai County has been built. The streets and houses there are all built according to design drawings, and every piece of building wood still emits the fragrance of the forest. At night there are ten thousand lights, and the roofs in the morning are like red waves. New factories are being born, and you see, young people are mastering new lathes, and the iron hammers of blacksmiths are clanging and vibrating. The flames in the melting iron furnace are as joyful and leaping as the flames of people's lives. At this time, Hong Jingliang, who used to spend every spring relying on bitter vegetables outside the old Jinzhai City, is now working under the bright electric lights of the new county. A child who grew up barefoot is now working at the county broadcasting station. How can he not be full of enthusiasm when talking about today's life: "People in the deep mountains used to know nothing. Now, in the People's Commune, all the way to the production team, broadcasting devices have been installed. People are extremely happy about this, saying that they know everything and their hearts are bright. Last year, when fighting drought, as soon as a broadcast was made, tens of thousands of people went to the front line of drought resistance overnight. A few days ago, a call was issued from the broadcast cylinder, and the spring plowing and fertilizer accumulation in the county started bustling..."

　　Two People's Communes

　　Next, I would like to talk about the two People's Communes I saw in Jinzhai County.

　　The Shuanghe People's Commune is in the deeper mountains than Meishan. As we approached the emerald green mountains, a new socialist scene came to meet us like the morning light. The members of the commune were plowing fields in the paddy fields, some were making seedling fields, white smoke from burning firewood fertilizer emerged from the mountains, and the riverbed was full of people releasing wooden rafts. Timber rushing down from the deep mountains was flowing downstream. Some people were sawing trees, preparing to plant Poria cocos in them. Last year, this commune produced a large Poria cocos weighing 140 catties. Here we see the advantages of the People's Commune combining agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fishery, and see how the members are working comfortably and enthusiastically.

　　A new spring has come to the mountains, and the people of Shuanghe are moving towards the high tide of a greater leap forward in 1959 with high spirits and doubled efforts. The day I went was a clear day after the first spring rain, skylarks were chirping in the air, turtledoves were calling in the woods, wheat seedlings were swaying in the wind, and rapeseed flowers were emitting bursts of strong fragrance. People told me: A few days ago, a mobilization meeting was held until late at night. It was like a red flare rising into the high sky. Before dawn, the thirteen households in Zaozui had put all thirteen cows on the plow; more than twenty women in Taoyuan braved the rain to rush to the fertilizer accumulation post; Shuangtang even made a leap forward, and as soon as the meeting ended, there was a sea of lanterns and torches, accumulating more than 1,500 loads of fertilizer overnight; a central team of the Baihua Production Brigade demonstrated the organizational skills of the members. At the meeting, a detailed plan was made based on each member's expertise, and in addition to the canteen service and handicraft occupying some people, the division of labor list was as follows: "Field Management - 40 people, plowing and making seedling fields - 18 people, chopping wood and burning firewood fertilizer - 40 people, spring planting - 12 people, water conservancy construction - 12 people." The rural social relations of the past, small-scale farming, and independent households have been replaced by new collective relations. The canteen has become the center of rural social life, where people eat, entertain, receive guests, hold meetings, and listen to the radio. Some of the mobilization meetings this time were also held by the dining table. In the past, spring famine was like a prairie fire. People in the deep mountains relied on kudzu roots, sunflower leaves, bitter vegetables, and Guanyin soil to survive. Now people love their canteens. The nursery is located next to the canteen, and mothers breastfeed their babies during meal times. Old people take a cigarette and walk from the canteen to the fields. Yang Debao, a 69-year-old member, said: "People used to say: rice is afraid of the noon wind, and people are afraid of being poor in old age. Now I can't be poor." What a carefree voice.

　　The Shuanghe People's Commune's Shewu Committee is in Longfengwan. This ancient big house was originally the house of the big rich man Feng in the Shuanghe mountainous area. At that time, people said: "It is hard to eat four liang of copper, and don't provoke the Feng family in Shuanghe." However, the flames of struggle were lit early in the deep mountains. As early as 1929, the Lenin Primary School was opened in the "Shuanghe Temple" on the riverside and mountain top. Now this temple runs a primary school and an agricultural technical school. A sound of reading spreads to the river. Someone once said that the colors in our lives are not rich enough, but the houses of the people in Shuanghe are painted so white, and the white walls are covered with murals. These murals are not only brightly colored, but also full of the atmosphere of the times - I can give two such huge murals here: One is a picture of the Shuanghe Commune fighting drought: last year, people here "maintained a bumper harvest for ninety days without rain." This giant painting shows the Party Committee Secretary taking the lead on the one hand, with thousands of troops and horses marching to the front line of the drought resistance struggle; on the other hand, green mountains flowing with green water, joyous crops, and red flags waving in the air. Also, look! This poster-style "Ye Chunxiu is really strong, production and work are all in line...", Ye Chunxiu, a young woman, is feeding pigs, and the group of gray piglets is painted so lifelike. I can say that Shuanghe's murals have embarked on a rural mural path with rich realistic colors. People are not only using labor to change the face of mountains and rivers, but also using art to decorate their beloved lives.

　　I walked upstream along the river to Shangdian Village to see the commune's steelmaking factory. The workshop is a spacious tile-roofed house, and a soil furnace is emitting thick smoke and spraying sparks. A surprising new thing has appeared in this quiet mountain village. The cumbersome work of pulling the bellows, which used to require twelve people in two shifts, has been replaced by spring water. Look! The water flows through the water tank, driving an axle, which pulls the bellows. The heavy and difficult steelmaking battle, with sweating, has become light and pleasant work here. I also went to see a new type of mill. This mill house is equipped with three wooden machines: water mill, water pestle, and water huller. As long as the sluice gate is opened, there is a sound of water, and a roar of wooden machines. Milling rice mills, shelling grains shells, and grinding flour grinds. In the past, four people pushed without stopping for a day. After pushing, their legs were tired and their arms were sore, and they could only push out four dou of wheat at most. Now let this small stream sing gently! One mill requires only one person to manage, and it grinds more than 900 catties of flour a day. The whole commune has now built six such mills. The water conservancy automation of the Shuanghe Commune is opening up the infinite potential of this deep mountain. Wisdom always shines in labor, and people's footsteps have already moved away and will move forward in a farther direction.

　　As we walked along the country lanes in the light red sunset, Li Gongchen, the Party Committee Secretary of the Shuanghe Commune, told me: "Our Sidingshan Reservoir project has been under construction for a month. We are striving to build a dam before the flood season and install a power station there in the future. Electric lights will illuminate our mountain villages..."

　　If the Shuanghe People's Commune is completely characteristic of the mountainous area, then let us now go to the vast wilderness downstream of the Shi River! If people come here, no matter how tired or busy you are, I advise you to visit the Kaishun Brigade of the Jiangdianzi Commune. The Shi River flows wider and wider through the Meishan Dam to here. The hazy place on the other side of the river is Gushi County, Henan Province, and the Kaishun Brigade is on this side of the river. This Kaishun Brigade is now an eloquent speaker. It will tell you with its own vivid reality: what is "the ambition of the working people," and what is "labor creating a new world." People say: This used to be just a poor sandy beach with white gravel! Now the sandy beach has become a golden manor.

　　After a few days of sunshine, the Jiangnan sun is already a bit hot. We came to the boundary of Kaishun Brigade along the newly built embankment. At a glance, where is there any shadow of a poor sandy beach? Everywhere is fertile black soil, densely planted with hemp, like someone embroidered exquisite green lace. However, if you want to estimate the wealth of Kaishun Brigade, you better examine the hemp stacks that pile up like mountains! This is the wealth of Kaishun people, the pride of Kaishun people. This is the hemp that remains after being sold to the state last year. Team leader Zhu Shichun excitedly told me that they still have seven such stacks. Now they have to plant new hemp and peel old hemp, and the manpower is really busy! But they are happy from the bottom of their hearts.

　　However, the road of Kaishun Brigade from poverty to prosperity has a bit of twists and turns, an experience. But it is this twist and turn, this experience, that highlights the ambition of people, the ambition of people. Who made this piece of land surrounded by rivers on three sides and mountains on one side, a piece of low-lying land! The land is thin and the foundation is poor, and for a considerable period of time after liberation, they had to eat the state's relief grain. However, in the upsurge of merging primary cooperatives into advanced cooperatives, the people of Kaishun beat gongs and drums and were full of enthusiasm. Unexpectedly, people said: There is no confidence in merging cooperatives with Kaishun people. The leading cadres brought the news back to Kaishun, and it burned the hearts of all Kaishun people like fire. At this critical moment, people shouted in unison: "We are not afraid of being poor, but we are afraid of being short-sighted!" "Do we have a poor root in our bodies?" They decided to dig pond mud and change the soil. They put forward a loud slogan: "Turn the sand nest into good fields." This slogan was passed from everyone's hand like a burning torch. Overnight, all the people of Kaishun moved, it was really thousands of troops and horses, with lights shining like daylight. Old grandmothers and old grandfathers went to the battlefield, and nine-year-old children pushed a small cart of mud. No matter how the northwest wind howled, no one was willing to step back. A large pond that no one had touched for hundreds of years was filled with twenty-eight waterwheels along the pond embankment, and people stepped on the waterwheels day and night. The captain and the Party branch secretary pumped water, and those who carried mud carried mud. No one returned to their own house in those hard-fought days. When people were sleepy, they closed their eyes in the shed on the pond embankment and jumped up to continue working. On the coldest day, Captain Yan Yuhou carried a large shovel and walked on the pond embankment. When he looked, the pond mud was frozen into ice edges. Everyone surrounded him, afraid to go down. But when Yan Yuhou thought about it, it was not easy to work on the waterwheel. If they relaxed, wouldn't the water overflow again? At this critical moment, he didn't care what to say, he threw off his shoes and jumped down regardless of the cold and freezing. Now, this Yan Yuhou is sitting at the desk in the Kaishun Management Area office. He stretched out his finger and pointed to Wang Daozhou, a hemp planting expert wearing a white cotton wool shirt, and said: "Isn't this Wang Daozhou! As soon as I jumped down, he followed closely and jumped down too. That day, we worked from morning to late, without eating a meal. We filled two mu and three points of land like we were seizing a position." It was this spirit of "the Foolish Old Man removing the mountain" that filled the white gravelly beach with black pond mud. The work was done in the winter of 1957-spring of 1958. In the autumn of that year, the hemp of Kaishun achieved a satisfactory harvest. Wang Daozhou created a national record of 2,406 catties per mu. The hat of poverty was taken off their heads, and they became the richest team among the thirteen brigades in the entire commune. People's living standards have risen. Team member Zhang Changlin told me: "I couldn't even wear shoes in the past. Now I have straight tribute coats, underwear, foreign cloth jackets, rubber-soled shoes, and savings in the credit union." In front of the young production team leader Guan Yongchang's door, two banners of honor from their team were flying. When talking about the past life, his mother shed tears, but last year the family sewed nine warm new quilts. I took advantage of the lunch break to visit three canteens. The menus of these three canteens are as follows: "Sijiaodian Canteen - steamed buns mixed with white flour and corn flour, Victory Canteen - rolls mixed with white flour and corn flour, Wantang Canteen - pancakes made with corn flour." At the canteen table, I saw the happy eyes of the children, and I saw the mother's warm care for her children.

　　Yan Yuhou now has a lofty belief: "We can't forget the pain after the scar is healed. We must extend the hand of friendship to help each other." Last year, their team allocated more than 3,000 catties of hemp to support one brigade and more than 120,000 catties of vegetables to support another brigade. When talking about the superiority of the People's Commune, Yan Yuhou opened his coat and revealed his chest: "We plant hemp and grasp the timing very tightly. We have to plant more than a thousand mu of land within nine days. This makes us feel that the manpower is not enough. This year, a phone call from the commune, and more than eighty members from Tangqiao and Fuhe came to support us with eighty cows. Look, isn't this the benefit of the commune? Needless to say, when they are transplanting rice seedlings over there, of course the people of Kaishun will also go to help."

　　Now, it's time for me to say goodbye to the Dabie Mountains. I returned to the Meishan Reservoir from Shuanghe-Kaishun. The reservoir power station is rushing to install the fourth generator. A red slogan is shaking on the construction site, which reads: "Mountains can't stop our determination, the sea can't stop our progress - fight for 'May Day' power generation!" The night is deep, and I am still standing in front of the high dam, my heart is full of endless nostalgia. After briefly summarizing what I have seen and heard in the past few days, I deeply feel that every one of our working people is an artist with a broad mind and grand spirit. They used their lives and their blood in the past to draw a red line of progress from the thorns; today, they use their lives and their energy to move mountains and overturn seas, fill ditches and level ravines, and draw brilliant pictures of life on our land. The morning breeze is so cool, and the morning sun will soon shine. At this time, I feel that the world in front of me is so broad and so far away. From the struggle to transform nature to the establishment of the People's Commune, in short, a brand-new society has been formed and consolidated. It is like the sun, bright red, bright, full of vigor, and steadily rising.

　　Let the snow-white waterfall flow!

　　If someone says that what I have unfolded here is no longer a painting but a scroll, then let us stand at Hengpai Tou, the hub of the Hangguan project where the Shi, Pi, and Hang rivers converge, a place full of the sense of the times, to end this scroll! This is one of the two oldest irrigation projects in Chinese history, one is the Dujiangyan in Sichuan, and the other is this Pobei, also known as Anfeng Pond, which was built by Sun Shuao, the prime minister of Chu in the Spring and Autumn Period. Cao Cao also repaired this water conservancy project later. Now, the sun is shining so brightly, on the vast construction site, dust and sand are flying, and rapids are splashing, which is very much like a fierce battlefield! Yes, people are at war with nature, changing the river channel that has not moved for thousands of years, and letting it flow according to people's will. People on the construction site say that you have come at the right time. The huge sluice gate of Hengpai Tou has just been poured with the last square of concrete. The bamboo bark tracks are winding and winding on the beach, countless red flags are fluttering in the high sky, the dump trucks are flying, the pumps are singing happily, the broadcasting cylinder is spreading urgent instructions, and the enthusiastic singing is also ringing. Standing here, you will feel that this is the real life, and everyone here is emitting heat and light. Let the song of tragic struggle in the Dabie Mountains fly to this place! Let it be closely integrated with the joyous song of new life on every inch of our land, and continue to fly forward! Let it fly like the wind over all the high mountains and plains in the world! Sweat is shining on people's faces, the project is growing rapidly, a load of mud, a shovel of soil, a drop of sweat, a cheer, and the several rivers that flow out of the depths of the Dabie Mountains will be forever and forever merged into a big river here. This big river is a river that has never been on the map, this big river is a river created by artificial means, but she will nourish the boundless land on both banks with her own milk like a mother, she will make every seedling thrive, every grain full, make life better, and make the land more fertile. For this newly born river, the people of Anhui have called it the "River of Happiness" with infinite affection. Then, can't the picture I show to the readers here also be called "the Picture of Happiness"? An engineer who accompanied me to inspect the Hengpai Tou construction site kept guiding me forward. He examined a dam that was being rushed to build and said: "In the future, this will be a very beautiful spillway dam. Look, as soon as the water is released, a wide, high, snow-white waterfall will appear." Yes, the snow-white waterfall will flow continuously, so let our lives also fly forward like a waterfall forever!

### 一幅灿烂的生活图画

　　一幅灿烂的生活图画
　　刘白羽
    在访问安徽的旅途中，使我最感奋的，就是在我们美丽的河山间，丰饶的大地上，人们正以无比的精力、凭着自由奔放的意志，在绘制出一幅一幅灿烂的生活图画。我现在只是把其中的一幅展现在读者的面前。
    英雄的山、英雄的人
    这儿有海涛一般的松林和竹林。我们随着渐陡渐狭的山势，曲折弯转，进入了大别山一条河谷。春阳晒得杜鹃花红如血滴，春风吹来兰花的幽香。忽然翻上岭头，向前一看：一条白茫茫的史河，夹在两面高峰之间，在河的正面矗现了一座摩天而立的灰白色高大水坝，这就是梅山水库的连拱坝。我在这人造的巨山和大湖的面前立定下来。我不能不惊喜地说：“这是一座多么庄严的殿堂！”我说它是“殿堂”——因为它是神圣劳动创造的，我说它是“殿堂”——因为它标志着大别山区走入一个灿烂的新时期。雨夜里，坝顶那珍珠般晶亮的灯光在河面上轻轻摇曳，晨曦中，那高架上的电线像闪亮的银丝。只要你细细倾听一下，那发电站的轰鸣不是今天幸福生活的歌唱吗？如果你再仔细寻思一下，这雪亮的电光里不也包含着我们英雄的历史的闪光吗？
    我无意停留在梅山水库的高坝面前，但是我知道，梅山一带在苏维埃时代叫作“赤城”——正是这红色的城啊！它给予我以重大的启示，它使我展眼看到大别山的心灵。你且站在那高山之巅去望一望，山峰接着山峰，山峦套着山峦。大别山这巨大的群山啊！像一只时刻都要展翅高飞的雄鹰，它把一只翅膀举向河南，一只翅膀伸向湖北。在这儿，每一片土地，每一座山岩都永远散发着英雄的气息。因为在山中住着这样的人民，他们一旦把真理的火种接受下来，就是他自己死了，也会把一颗刚正不屈的心传给自己的后人。在这儿，请听听一位慈爱的母亲、善良的妻子、忠诚不移的游击战士张尚文的衷心的倾诉吧！
    “……斗争的环境更艰苦了。有一天我们正在山上吃野菜，他（张的丈夫汪来应，这个游击队的队长）放哨监视着敌人，没想到敌人从背后来了，而且是从麻埠、南溪、金寨、丁埠一齐出动的，……我们一听枪响得那样近，就往大山上跑，一大片敌人刻不容缓地追了过来。敌人愈逼愈近，眼看就跑不脱了，……大家抬头一看，半山腰有一口水塘，里面盖满干荷叶，人们就纷纷跳下去，躲藏在水底下，拿干荷叶盖上头。我抱住孩子也跳下去，那正是隆冬天气，水冷透骨，我咬紧牙关，可是生下来没有多久的小孩子一下啼哭起来，……敌人骑兵眼看就奔到跟前来了，如若发觉，全体同志不就都遭殃了吗？这时候我知道：要孩子就没同志，要同志就没有孩子，……我心一横把我亲生的孩子捺到水底下，……我的孩子，在水里还不断的抖动，挣扎，可是有什么办法，我只有咬紧了牙，……我的心痛极了，——简直痛出血来了，……我像死人一样眼看着马蹄得得跑过去，仇恨，痛苦，真想喊起来射击呀！……大家爬出来，看着死在地下的孩子，默默无语，含满眼泪。一位老同志说：‘尚文！你这是干什么？要死大家一齐死吧！……’他说不下去了。——我坐在地上看着自己的孩子，昏迷了过去。同志们救我到山上，烧火烤我，慢慢把我烘干了烤暖了，我半天才苏醒，可是睁开眼一看丈夫不在面前，问一问同志们，才知道他给敌人抓走了。这怎么得了！我又一次昏迷了过去。有一天，有人从街上回来，说看到了我丈夫的‘罪状’，说已经判了死刑，我一听心如刀割，同志们也都气愤万分，纷纷要去劫法场。可是那完全是死路一条。我靠在一根松树上，闭一闭眼，对大家说：‘同志们！我们不能这样，不能为了一个人毁掉了全体，我们活着的还要继续斗争下去呀！’……”
    现在张尚文所说的每一个字，都记录在金寨县革命回忆录篇页之中了。可是，这难道只是张尚文一个人的倾诉吗？不，这是大别山的倾诉。我是第一次到大别山来，我本不想把这山谷中悲壮的往事重新提起。不过当我看到这一切，听到这一切的时候，我不能不想到杜勒斯之流对我们的大跃进所进行的诬蔑，我们在热情的建设自己幸福的生活，他们却说是在“大规模地使用奴隶劳动”“建立一个巨大的奴隶国家”。不错，我们是从血里、火里斗争出来的人，我们不但懂得什么叫奴隶，我们更懂得怎样粉碎帝国主义者对人民的奴役。历史总是在教育着我们，悲壮的往事不断给我们以力量；正是穿过暴风雨的人，今天，在我们自己的大地上，以无比舒畅的心情、热情奔放的脚步前进。不但今天这样，明天也这样，这是谁也阻拦不了的。
    一个旧城的消失和一个新城的诞生
    我不想再在这儿进行个人的论述，不过，在我去访问人民公社的途程中，我得利用时间，谈一下：一个古老的金寨县怎样从地面上消失，一个崭新的金寨县怎样在地面上诞生。
    我搭一只小机轮，横过“梅山水库”，细细体味了“高峡出平湖”的意趣。不过，在这儿，与其说是湖，倒像是平静的海峡。水库南北直径一百多里，两旁全是陡峭的高山，满山竹树成林，碧绿苍苍，从高高的岩顶上跌下白练般一道瀑布，碧绿的湖面映着火焰一样鲜红的杜鹃花。船随着湖面曲折而前，水库给大别山深山区，提供了一条航运道路。
    人们摊开金寨县地图指给我看：前面吴店、黄龙、南溪一带都是大炼钢铁的战场。在火光烟影之中，人们留下这样的诗句：“密麻炉群赛繁星，英雄昼夜忙不停，且看熊熊火舌舞，每炉日夜产千吨”“大别山下好风光，炼铁土炉排成行，炉炉烈火冲天起，滚滚铁水赛长江”。现下，湖上不断有长长的竹筏蜿蜒而来，上面满载新炼出的铁块。
    生活中常有这样的事，当你对面前的世界，还没来得及仔细思索，一句话忽然把你的眼界打开。现在，我身旁这一位青年朋友洪敬良就这样帮助了我。他一会指给我：“从前弯腰进去的小草房都淹没了，你看，立在山坡上的那一幢一幢青砖瓦房都是政府新盖的。”一会又告诉我：“我小时候在河里摸来摸去，只有手指头长短的小棍子鱼，现在这水库里有多少鱼呀！过不久，我们金寨县平均每人有五百斤鱼呢！”总之，从他的心里透露出来的全是新生、喜悦，有如晨曦。我们穿过狮子口山峡，山势渐远，湖面平如镜面。而洪敬良变得更加激动了。他指着前面对我说：“我们现在正在老金寨县城的上空。”洪敬良的故居，早已沉没在湖底下了。一个老城不见了，而在梅山水库旁，沿着史河两岸，一个崭新的金寨县建成了。那儿街道房屋完全是按照设计画样建筑出来的，那儿每一块建筑木料还散发着森林的芳香，夜晚是万家灯火，早晨的屋顶有如红色波涛，一座座新的工厂正在诞生，你看看，年青的人掌握着新的车床，而打铁的铁锤在叮当震响，那熔铁炉里的火焰呀，就像人的生命的火焰一样欢腾跳荡。这时，在旧金寨城外每个春天靠苦花菜度日的洪敬良，现在在新县城明亮的电灯光下工作了；一个打赤脚长大的孩子，现在在县广播站工作了，他谈起今天的生活怎能不满怀热情：“从前深山里的人什么事情都不知道，现在人民公社里，一直到生产小队，都安了广播器，人们对这件事可高兴透顶，说什么事情都知道，心里可亮堂堂的了。去年抗旱的时候，一个广播，话音刚落地，十几万人，连夜走上抗旱战线，前些天广播筒里又传出一个号召，全县春耕积肥就热热闹闹地开展起来了，……”
    两个人民公社
    下面，我想谈到我所看到的金寨县的两个人民公社。
    双河人民公社在比梅山更深的深山里。当我们向碧绿的群山走近时，一派社会主义新景象像晨光迎面而来。公社的社员们有的在水田里犁田、有的在做秧母田，山林里面冒出烧火肥的白烟，满河床站满放木排的人，从深山里冲下来的木材正顺流而下。有的人锯断树木，准备在里面种茯苓，去年这个公社出产了一枚一百四十斤重的大茯苓。在这里我们看到人民公社农林牧副渔相结合的优越性，看到社员们怎样舒畅而热情的劳动。
    一个新的春天来到山中，双河的人们正以高涨的情绪、加倍的干劲，走向1959年更大跃进的高潮。我去的这一天，正是春雨初收一片晴，百灵在空中鸣啭，斑鸠在树林里呼唤，麦苗在迎风招展，油菜花透出阵阵浓香。人们告诉我：前几天，一个动员会开到夜深。就像一个红色信号弹升上高空。天未放明，枣咀的十三户人家已经把十三条牛全部套上犁田了；桃园的二十多个妇女冒着雨抢上了积肥的岗位；双塘更跃进，会议一结束，就一片灯笼火把，连夜积肥一千五百多担；百花生产大队的一个中心队表现了社员们的组织性，在会议上，根据每一个社员的专长作出分工负责的详尽的计划，除去食堂服务及手工业占用一部分人外，分工的单子是这样：“田间管理——四十人，犁田、做秧田——十八人，砍柴、烧火肥——四十人，春种——十二人，兴修水利——十二人。”过去小农经济，自立门户的农村社会关系，已经被新的集体关系所代替了，食堂变成农村社会生活的中心，人们吃饭、娱乐、待客、会议、听广播都在食堂里，这次的一些动员会议也都是在饭桌旁开的。从前春荒像燎原大火，深山里的人，靠葛根、葵花叶、苦花菜、观音土度命，现在人们热爱着自己的食堂，托儿所设在食堂旁边，母亲们在吃饭时间就哺乳了婴儿，老人家抽一枝香烟从食堂出来走向田间。六十九岁的老社员杨德宝说：“从前人说：稻怕午时风，人怕老来穷，现在我是穷不了了。”这是多么无忧无虑的声音。
    双河人民公社社务委员会在龙凤湾，这所古老的大屋，原来是双河山区大富豪冯家的房子，当时人们说：“硬吃四两铜，不惹双河一门冯”。不过斗争的火焰早在深山里点燃，远在1929年，河畔山顶上的“双河大庙”里就开办过列宁小学。现在这庙里办着一所小学和一个农业技术学校，一片朗朗的读书声，传到河边上来。有人曾经说我们的生活中色彩太不丰富，但是双河人们的房屋却粉刷得那样雪白，而在雪白的墙壁上，画满壁画，这些壁画不但色调鲜艳，而且洋溢着时代气息，——我这里可以举出这样两幅巨大的壁画：一幅画的是双河公社抗旱图：去年这里的人们“九十天无雨保丰收”，这幅巨画，一边是党委书记带头，千军万马，走上抗旱斗争前线；一边是青山流着绿水，田禾喜气洋洋，空中招展着红旗。还有，请看！这一幅招贴画式的“叶春秀真正强，生产工作都在行……”，叶春秀这个年青妇女正在喂猪，那一群灰色小猪崽，画得实在栩栩如生。我可以说，双河的壁画走上了一条富有现实色彩的农村壁画途径，人们不但用劳动改变着山河的面貌，而且以艺术装饰着自己可
    爱的生活。
    我沿河流向上走，到上店村去看公社的炼铁厂。场房是一栋宽敞的瓦顶房屋，一只土炉炉顶正冒着浓烟，喷着火星。一件令人惊喜的新事物在这幽静的山村里出现了。原来烦重的，要十二个人两班倒拉风箱工作，已经由泉水代替了。你看！水流过水箱，带动一个轮轴，拉动了风箱，沉重艰难、汗流浃背的炼铁战斗在这儿变为轻松愉快的工作了。我还去看了一座新型的磨坊，在这个磨坊房里设有水磨、水碓、水砻三部木机，只要把水闸的闸门拉开，一片水鸣声，一片木机的轰响，舂米的舂米，脱谷的脱谷，磨粉的磨粉，从前四个人一天不断头的推，推乏了两腿，推酸了双臂，顶多能推出四斗麦子。现在让这小小的溪流轻轻的吟唱吧！一座磨坊只要一个人管理，一天就磨出九百多斤面粉，全社现在已经兴筑了这样六个磨坊。双河公社的水利自动化，正在打开这深山的无限潜力，智慧总是在劳动中闪光的，人们的脚步已经走开了，就会向更远的方向前进。
    当我们在淡红的夕照里，沿着田间小路行走，双河公社党委书记李功臣同志告诉我：“我们的四顶山水库工程已经开工一个月了，争取汛期前筑起堤坝，将来在那儿安装上发电站，电灯就要照明我们的山村了……。”
    如果说双河人民公社完全是山区特色，那么，现在让我们走向史河下游那广阔的原野吧！人们如若到了这儿，不论你多么疲劳，多么忙碌，我劝你一定得去访问一下江店子公社的开顺大队。史河通过梅山水坝到这儿愈流愈加宽阔，河那面雾蒙蒙的地方是河南省的固始县，开顺大队就在河的这边。这个开顺大队现在是一个雄辩家，它将以它自己的生动现实，告诉你：什么叫“劳动人民的志气”，什么叫“劳动创造新世界”。人们说：从前这儿只是一片白砾砾的穷沙滩啊！现在沙滩变成了黄金的庄园。
    晴了几天，江南的阳光已经有点燥热。我们顺着新筑的堤埂来到开顺大队地界。一眼望去，这儿哪里有什么一点穷沙滩的影子呢？到处是肥沃的黑土地，上面密密地植满大麻，像谁绣出精美的绿色花边。不过，你如若估计开顺大队的财富，你最好考察一下那像山一样堆积的麻垛吧！这是开顺人的财富，这是开顺人的骄傲。这是去年向国家出售之外还余存下来的大麻。小队长朱视春兴高采烈地告诉我：他们还有这么七大垛，现在是又要种新麻，又要剥旧麻，人手实在忙呀！可是忙得从心里高兴。
    不过，开顺大队由贫困走向富裕的道路，却有一点曲折、一番经历。但正是这曲折、这经历突出的表现了人的雄心、人的志气。谁让这片土地三面靠河，一面靠山，是块低洼地呢！土地薄，底子差，解放后相当时期不能不吃着国家的救济粮。可是，在由初级社并高级社的热潮中，开顺的人敲锣打鼓、满腔热情，没料想人家却说：跟开顺的人并社没有信心。领导干部把这消息带回开顺，它像火一样炙痛了所有开顺人的心。就在这节骨眼上，人们众口一声地喊出来：“不怕人穷，只怕志短！”“难道我们身上有穷根吗？”他们决定挖塘泥，改土壤，他们提出一个响亮的口号：“变沙窝为良田”。这口号像一支熊熊燃烧的火把从每人手上传递过去。一夜之间，所有开顺的人都动起来了，真是千军万马、火光烛天，老奶奶、老爷爷都上了战场，九岁的孩子也推上一小车泥，任凭西北风呼呼叫啸，谁也不肯退后一步。一口上百年没谁动过的大水塘，沿着塘堰架上二十八张水车，人们两脚日夜不停的踩着水车猛转。队长、党支部书记车水的车水，挑泥的挑泥，那些苦战的日子里谁也没回过自己的屋门。人们困了，就在塘堰上草棚里闭一闭眼跳起来再干。这天到了最寒冷的一天，队长阎玉厚扛了把大锹走上塘堰，一看，塘泥冻成冰凌，大伙儿围着，不敢往下下。可是阎玉厚一想：好容易把水车干了，要一放松，水不就又漫上来了吗？在这紧要关头，他也顾不得说什么，就把鞋子摔掉，不顾天寒冰冻，跳了下去。现在，这个阎玉厚就坐在开顺管理区办公室的桌边。他伸手指指那个穿着一件白棉毛球衫的植麻能手王道洲说：“这不是王道洲吗！我跳下去，他就紧跟着也跳下去了。那天从早晨干到下晚，饭都没吃，我们就像抢阵地一样填了二亩三分地。”正是这一种“愚公移山”的精神，在一片片白砾砾的沙滩上，一担担填上乌黑的塘泥。事情是1957年冬—1958年春干的，就这一年秋天，开顺的大麻获得了美满的丰收，王道洲创造了一亩地二千四百零六斤的全国最高纪录。贫困的帽子从他们头上摘下去了，他们变成为全公社十三个大队里面最富裕的一个队。人们的生活水平上升了，队员张长林告诉我：“从前连鞋也穿不上，现在直贡呢的袄、卫生衣、洋布褂、胶底鞋，在信用社里还有我的存款”年青的生产组长管永昌门前，飘扬着他们小组两面锦旗。谈到过去生活时，他的母亲流下了热泪，可是，去年一家人缝了暖和和的九床新棉被。我趁着午饭时间，访问了三个食堂，这三个食堂的饭单是这样：“四家店食堂——白面掺玉米面的蒸馍，胜利食堂——白面掺玉米面的卷子，万塘食堂——玉米面的烙饼。”在食堂桌边，我看到孩子们愉快的眼色，我看到母亲对儿女温暖的关怀。
    阎玉厚现在有一个崇高的信念：“我们不能好了疮疤忘了痛，要伸出友谊之手去互相帮助。”去年他们队拨出三千多斤大麻支援一个大队、蔬菜十二万多斤支援另一个大队。说到人民公社的优越性，阎玉厚敞开褂子，袒露出胸怀：“我们种麻，掌握时机很紧，九天以内要把一千几百多亩地都种上，这就感到人手不够。今年，公社一个电话，塘桥、付河那边就有八十多个社员，牵着八十条牛来支援我们，你看，这不是公社的好处吗？那还用说，等到他们那边栽秧的时候，当然我们开顺的人也要去帮忙。”
    现在，到了我向大别山告别的时候了。我从双河—开顺又回到梅山水库来了。水库发电站正在赶装第四台发电机。在工地上抖动着一幅红色标语，写着：“山挡不住我们的决心，海拦不住我们的前进，——为‘五一’发电而战！”夜已深沉，我还站在高坝面前，我心中充满无限的留恋。稍稍总结了一下这几日的见闻，我深深感到我们每一个劳动人民，都是有着开阔胸怀和宏伟气魄的艺术家。他们过去用自己的生命，自己的鲜血，从荆棘中划出一条前进的红线；他们今天用自己的生命，自己的精力，移山倒海，填沟平壑，在我们大地上画出一幅幅灿烂的生活图画。晨风如此清凉，朝曦不久就将照临，这时，我觉得我面前的世界如此开阔，如此辽远，从改造大自然的斗争到人民公社的建立，总之，一个崭新的社会已经形成、巩固，它像太阳，鲜红，明亮，充满朝气，稳步上升。
    雪白的瀑布奔流吧！
    如若有人说我在这儿展开的早已不是一幅画而是一个画卷，那么，让我们站在史、淠、杭三河汇流的航灌工程的枢纽——横排头，这个洋溢着时代感的地方，来结束这个画卷吧！这是中国历史中最古老的两大灌溉工程之一，一个是四川的都江堰，一个就是这个?陂，又名安丰塘，是春秋时代楚相孙叔敖兴造，后来曹操也曾修过这个水利工程。现在，阳光照得这样灿烂，广阔的工地上，尘沙在飞扬，激流在飞溅，这多像一个激战的战场啊！是的，人正是在和大自然宣战，改变千年不移的河道，让它按照人们的意志奔流。工地上的人说你们来得正好，横排头这个巨大的水闸恰好刚刚浇完了最后一方混凝土。竹皮的轨道纵横蜿蜒在沙滩上，无数红旗在高空中猎猎作响，斗车在飞奔，抽水机在欢唱，广播筒上一下传播出紧急的指令，一下又响起热情洋溢的歌声。你站在这儿，你会觉得：这才是真正的生活，这儿每个人都在发出热，发出光。让大别山那悲壮斗争的歌声飞扬到这儿来吧！让它和我们每一寸土地上新生的愉悦的歌声紧密地融合，再继续向前飞扬吧！让它像风一样飞过全世界那一切的高山和平原吧！汗珠在人们脸上闪光，工程在飞速的成长，一担泥，一锹土，一滴汗水，一声欢呼，而从大别山深处奔流出来的几道河流，就将在这儿永远永远地汇成一道大河了。这条大河是地图上从来没有过的河，这条大河是人工创造出来的河，但她将像母亲一样用自己的乳汁哺养两岸广无边际的土地，她将让每一株苗茁壮，每一颗粒饱满，让生活变得更美，让土地变得更肥。对于这新诞生的河流，安徽人民已经以无限深情称它为“幸福之河”了，那么，我在这儿展现给读者的图画不也可以叫作“幸福的图画”吗？陪伴我巡视横排头工地的一位工程师却不停的引导我前行，他端详着一处正在抢筑的堤坝说：“将来，这是一个很漂亮的滚水坝，你看，只要一放水，一道宽宽的、高高的、雪白的瀑布就出现了。”是的，雪白的瀑布将不息的奔流，那么，让我们的生活，也像瀑布一样永远飞腾前进吧！
