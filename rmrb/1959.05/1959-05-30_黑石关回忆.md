The quietly flowing Luo River, bathed in the light of the setting sun, shimmered with waves. Fertile fields stretched endlessly along both banks of the Luo River. Commune members were busily transporting fertilizer to the fields. Carrying poles, pushing carts, they were tense and busy; but the people no longer wore the weary, haggard, and overwhelmed expressions of the old days, and their faces flashed with joy, a manifestation of their confidence in and longing for the future.

The Longhai Railway spans the Luo River, with a bridge arching over it, named Black Stone Pass, said to be a military stronghold in ancient times. A train from the east crossed the Black Stone Pass Bridge and wound its way westward, emitting a rhythmic sound. A group of young men and women leaned against the windows, greedily admiring the scenery of the Central Plains. Perhaps they were going to study at a university in the ancient capital of Luoyang, perhaps they were going west out of Tongguan to Tianshui to look for mineral deposits, or perhaps they were going even further, to Karamay to extract oil... The road ahead of them was so wide!

I stood by the river, facing this scene of peace, happiness, and vitality, and was filled with infinite thoughts. Those young people leaning against the windows might imagine tractors galloping in the fields along the railway in the future, and rows of cave dwellings under the loess hills turning into bright and spacious new houses... Although my temples are already gray, like these young people, I am filled with passionate love for the magnificent mountains and rivers of the motherland; and I cherish beautiful hopes for a happier life in the future. However, there is probably one thing that I think of that the young people have not thought of. I thought of the difficult days of the past, I thought of war. Memories took me back fifteen years, when this place was completely different: floods and droughts, the Kuomintang's Tang Enbo's exorbitant taxes and levies, and the Japanese devils' looting, burning, and killing, made the fields desolate, nine out of ten houses empty, and smoke filled the air... My comrades and I once fought in this place.

In the spring of 1944, after the Japanese devils captured Zhengzhou, they divided their forces into two routes: one along the Beijing-Hankou Railway to the south, and the other along the Longhai Railway to the west. The Kuomintang's 400,000 troops stationed in the Tiger Lao Pass and Black Stone Pass area retreated like a tide. The 400,000 troops were not defeated, because many units never met the Japanese invaders on the battlefield. Often, the enemy was still dozens of miles away, and they had already fled in panic.

Thirty million people were abandoned by the Kuomintang, and the Central Plains fell under the iron hooves of the enemy. At that time, there was a folk song circulating: "The eastern soldiers come, the western soldiers go, the eastern soldiers can fight but cannot defend, just look at the ninth day of the ninth month this year." The eastern soldiers refer to the Japanese devils, and the western soldiers refer to the Kuomintang army. The people of western Henan firmly believed that the Communist Party and Chairman Mao would send troops to rescue them, and placed all their hopes on the Eighth Route Army. Sure enough, we did not disappoint the people's trust and expectations. Before the ninth day of the ninth month, in August, our Eighth Route Army's advance detachment - the Western Henan Detachment - crossed the Yellow River in southern Shanxi and entered the enemy's rear in western Henan. Right here, we launched a surprise night attack on Black Stone Pass, annihilating a small team of Japanese devils and more than 100 puppet soldiers, destroying 13 small steamships, and sending more than 2,000 migrant workers who had been captured to build bridges back home, winning the first victory in the deep penetration into the enemy's rear in western Henan, and establishing the banner of resistance against Japan in western Henan.

Today, seeing this peaceful, happy, and not yet rich but thriving life of the people of western Henan, the past suffering of the people of western Henan is churning fiercely in my mind.

From 1942 to 1944, there were three consecutive years of severe drought, and in 1943 and 1944, there were also locust plagues everywhere. This was truly a land of famine! The planted corn died in the fields before the seedlings even emerged from the soil. The autumn crops such as sorghum and beans were not harvested, and the locusts came, covering the sky and the earth. There were hundreds of them on one sorghum stalk, and in a short while, a field of crops would be eaten clean. People had no strength to fight them off, and they could not be wiped out anyway. Women and children sat on the edges of the fields and wept. Some places harvested a little grain, but the highest yield per mu was no more than three sheng. The people struggled on the brink of starvation and death, eating bean leaves, eating tree bark, and even eating "stone dry" (Guanyin soil). As the saying goes, "The King of Hell is not afraid of thin ghosts." Even in such years, Tang Enbo still had to collect 3.2 million shi of military grain from the people of Henan every year according to Chiang Kai-shek's order. One day, we camped in a village and wanted to borrow an empty cave dwelling, but we couldn't find the owner. Later, the people in the village told us the tragic story of the owner of this cave dwelling: it was originally inhabited by a lonely old woman, whose son was captured by Tang Enbo to serve as a soldier, and was buried alive for deserting. The old woman had been starving for several days and sold the last few pieces of clothing she had left to exchange for a few catties of rice; but as soon as the rice was brought into the house, the Baozhang (village head) came with the grain search team. There was no time to hide it, and it was snatched away along with the bag. That night, the poor old woman closed the door and hanged herself.

This was the life of the people of western Henan fifteen years ago.

Fifteen years, this is a short period in the long river of history, but how many earth-shaking changes have taken place during this period! How far has our country come!

In modern Chinese history, how many people with lofty ideals, how many patriots, what they dreamed of and strived for all their lives, was not the great ideal of "Great Harmony"? Isn't it a society where "the old are cared for until their death, the strong are employed, and the young are nurtured"? And what we have today is ten times or even a hundred times more than the imagination of our ancestors.

After staying in Black Stone Pass for a short time, I went to Dengfeng and visited Dongxi Bailiping, which is a basin surrounded by mountains. Fifteen years ago, our Western Henan Detachment headquarters was located here. I visited the elders and brothers who had shared life and death with me in the past. On the way back to the county seat, a young man in the car mistook me for a visitor from afar and pointed out to me: This is Mount Funiu, that is Mount Yudai, and there are also the Shaolin Temple, the Zhongyue Temple and other places of interest. I thanked him for his kindness. During the conversation, I saw that he was wearing a badge, a student of a technical school, and I asked him what he was studying. The simple peasant boy's face was immediately filled with happiness and pride. He told me: "Learning to drive a car, a driver." As he spoke, he made gestures as if he was really sitting on the driving platform.

Infected by the young man's enthusiasm, I revisited Mount Song, the Zhongyue. Walking into the Zhongyue Temple at the foot of the mountain, the workers were repairing it. The first thing that caught my eye was the archway with the inscription "Matching Heaven and Acting as a Town", which had been freshly painted. I was eager to climb to the top of the mountain to see what changes had taken place here in the era when the people are the masters of their own affairs. Following the mountain road, I went straight up, sweating profusely, but because I was excited, I didn't feel tired and climbed to the top in one breath. There is a pavilion on the top of the peak, the statue of the god in the pavilion has been destroyed, there is no plaque, and below the pavilion, there is a stone tablet with the two characters "Yue Ling" (Mountain Spirit) carved in large characters. Standing in the pavilion, the weather was clear and sunny, and looking up, there were tens of thousands of acres of fertile fields, a scene of spring. Several towering chimneys gave a particularly deep impression, they seemed more majestic than those "perilously high" mountains, which showed a historical turning point: this barren and backward area is about to march towards industrialization!

    黑石关回忆
    中将　皮定钧
    静静流着的洛河水，被西斜的太阳照射得波光闪闪。洛河两岸，肥田沃土，广阔无垠。社员们正在往地里送肥。挑担的，推车的，紧张、忙碌；但人们不再有旧时代那种疲惫、憔悴、不堪重压的神色，眉宇间闪动着喜气，这是对未来充满了信心、向往的表现。
    陇海路横跨洛河，一桥飞架其上，桥的名字叫作黑石关，据说古时候这里是一个军事要隘。一列火车从东开来，经过黑石关大桥蜿蜒西下，发出节奏均匀的声响。一群男女青年，倚着车窗，贪婪地欣赏着这中原景色。他们也许是到古都洛阳去进大学的，也许是西出潼关到天水去寻找矿藏的，也可能走的更远，到克拉玛依去开采石油……。摆在他们面前的道路是多么宽广啊！
    我伫立河畔，面对着这一片和平幸福、充满生机的情景，涌起了无限的思绪。那些倚着车窗的青年人，可能想到将来铁路两旁的田野上会有拖拉机驰骋，黄土岭下那一排排的窑洞会变成清堂瓦舍的新房……。虽然我的两鬓已经斑白，但和这些青年人一样，对祖国壮丽的山河，我也是充满了热爱的激情；对未来更加幸福的生活，我也是怀抱着美丽的憧憬。不过，我想到的事情，大概有一点是青年们没想到的。我想到了过去的艰难的日月，我想到了战争。回忆把我带到了十五年前，那时候，这里可完全是另一个样子：水旱灾荒，国民党汤恩伯的横征暴敛，日本鬼子的劫掠烧杀，使得田园寥落，十室九空，遍地硝烟……我和我的战友们，曾经战斗在这个地方。
    1944年春天，日本鬼子攻陷郑州后，分兵两路：一路沿京汉路向南，一路沿陇海路向西。驻守在虎牢关、黑石关一带的国民党四十万部队，像潮水般的溃退下来。四十万军队，并不是被打垮的，因为很多部队根本没和日寇在战场上见面，往往是敌人还在好几十里以外，他们就抱头鼠窜了。
    三千万人民被国民党抛弃了，中原沦于敌寇的铁蹄之下。那时候，流传着一首民谣：“东兵来，西兵走，东兵能打不能守，单看今年九月九。”东兵指日本鬼子，西兵指国民党军队。豫西人民深信，共产党、毛主席会派队伍来解救他们，把希望完全寄托在八路军身上。果然，我们没有辜负人民的信任和期待，没等九月九，8月里我们八路军的先遣支队——豫西支队，在晋南渡过了黄河，开进豫西敌后，就在这里举行了一次奇兵夜袭黑石关，消灭了日本鬼子一个小队、伪军一百多人，击毁小汽船十三艘，把两千多名被抓来修桥的民工放回家去，赢得了深入豫西敌后作战的第一个胜利，在豫西树起了抗日的旗帜。
    今天，看见了豫西人民的这种和平的、幸福的、还不大富裕但却是蒸蒸日上的生活，过去豫西人民的苦难，就在我脑子里激烈地翻腾起来。
    从1942年到1944年，连着三年大旱，1943年和1944年还加上遍地蝗蝻，这里真是赤地千里！已种上的玉茭，嫩芽还没出土，就干死在地里。高粱豆子等大秋作物，颗粒未收，蝗蝻袭来，遮天盖地，一棵高粱上能有几百个，不大会儿，一片庄稼就被吃光了。人们没有力气去打，打也打不尽，妇女、小孩坐在地头上呜呜啼哭。有的地方收了点谷子，但每亩最高产量不过三升。人民在饥饿死亡线上挣扎着，吃豆叶，吃树皮，甚至于吃“石干”（观音土）。俗话说，“阎王不怕鬼瘦”。就是这样的年景，汤恩伯仍根据蒋介石的手令，每年要河南人民交出三百二十万石的军粮。有一天，我们宿营在一个村子里，想借住一个空着的窑洞，却找不到房东是谁。后来村里的人向我们介绍了这个窑洞主人的悲惨的故事：这里原来住的是个孤老婆子，儿子被汤恩伯抓去当兵，因为开小差被逮回去活埋了。老婆子饿了好几天，把最后剩下的几件衣服卖掉，才换了几斤米；可是米刚拿进屋，保长带着搜粮队就来了，藏也来不及，连口袋一起被抢了去。当天晚上，这个可怜的老人就关起门来上吊死了。
    这就是十五年前豫西人民的生活。
    十五年，这在历史的长河中是一个短暂的时期，但是，这其间发生了多少翻天复地的变化！我们的国家走了多远哪！
    中国近代史上，多少仁人志士，多少爱国者，他们梦寐以求、毕生为之奋斗的伟大理想，不就是“大同”二字么？不就是一个“老有所终，壮有所用，幼有所长”的社会么？而我们今天所有的，已经是十倍乃至百倍地超过了先人的想像了。
    在黑石关停留不久，我又到了登丰，访问了东西百里坪，那是一个四面环山的盆地。十五年前，我们的豫西支队司令部就设在这里。看望了以前同过生死的父老弟兄，在赶回县城的路上，同车的一个小伙子把我看成了远道而来的参观者，向我指指点点：这是伏牛山，那是玉带山，还有少林寺，中岳庙等等名胜。我感谢他的盛情。谈话时我见他佩带着一个胸章，是技术学校的学员，我问他学什么。这个纯朴的农家子弟顿时满脸洋溢着幸福和骄傲的神情，他告诉我：“学开汽车，驾驶员”说的时候，他做着手式，像是真的坐在驾驶台上一样。
    被那个青年人的热情所感染，我重游了中岳嵩山。走进山脚下的中岳庙，工人们正在修葺，最先映入眼帘的，还是那个上书“配天作镇”的牌坊，它被油饰一新了。我急着爬上山顶，去看一看在人民当家做主的时代，这儿起了什么变化。巡着山路，径直往上，走的汗水淋漓，因为心情兴奋，竟不觉累，一气登上了峰顶。峰顶有一座亭子，亭中神像已毁，无匾额，亭子下面，有一石碑，上刻斗大的“岳灵”二字。在亭台小立，天气晴和，抬眼望，良田万顷，春光一片。几座高高耸起的烟囱，给人特别深刻的印象，它似乎比那些“危乎高哉”的山峰更雄伟，这显示了一个历史的转折点：这块贫瘠落后的地区，要向工业化进军了！
