Three Poems

    Building a Home in Northern Tibet
    Heaven connects to earth, and earth connects to heaven,
    Northern Tibet has been sparsely populated for thousands of years;
    Since the Qinghai-Tibet Road was built,
    A million soldiers have built a home here.

    The Qinghai-Tibet Highway Ascends to the Sky
    The Kunlun Mountains are as sharp as knife points,
    Layers of white clouds surround the mountains;
    Heroes come to build the road,
    Stepping on clouds, they are better than immortals;
    Swinging iron picks, the mountain trembles,
    The Qinghai-Tibet Highway ascends to the sky.

    A Restaurant in the Mountains
    The Non-Freezing Spring, a small restaurant,
    Stopping is an old habit;
    Everyone says it's a little warmer when you get to the station,
    A sip of boiling water feels sweet.

    诗三首
    藏北建家园天连地来地连天，千年藏北少人烟；自从修了青藏路，百万雄师建家园。
    青藏公路上了天昆仑高山像刀尖，层层白云绕山间；英雄好汉来开路，脚踏云朵赛神仙；抡起铁镐山打颤，青藏公路上了天。
    山中饭店不冻泉，小饭站，到站停车老习惯；都说进站三分暖，喝口开水也觉甜。
