Six Songs
Zhao Puchu

Tian Jing Sha
Moscow University and Underground Railway
The cloud walls soar to the blue sky, and the thunder cars descend to the yellow springs. Who says it's vast and unseen?
The Dragon Palace and Moon Palace are all in the human world.

Two More Songs
Passing Through Riga, Capital of the Latvian Soviet Socialist Republic
Green shade, fragrant grass, and people's homes, light sails, flowing water, and bright clouds, a picture of Jiangnan.
Circling down, not knowing I've arrived in Riga.

Wild geese leave traces in the jade palace, the people of this country are exquisite. Forever enshrined in my heart,
Passionate greetings and farewells, famous flowers, and delicious food, a rich spring. ①
① I was warmly received by comrades from the Latvian Peace Committee at the airport.

Drunkenly Singing a Song with Rice Straw Sandals
Written for Stockholm
Driving long rainbow bridges and shadows horizontally and vertically, overlooking green trees and buildings partially hidden. The sea breeze comes, and the fairies should be awakened, delighted that the fragrant grass is near at the end of the world.
Is it not Heaven's blessing to have no war? More than a hundred years of enjoying peace. Five hundred million people are competing to sign for you. ① Fluttering seagull dreams are stable, and the vast sea waves are clear, wishing human happiness forever.
① Refers to the Stockholm Declaration of the World Peace Congress

Yangchun Tune
Visiting Sculptor Milles' Garden in Stockholm
The best place for sea and sky, snipped three bows, pearls and jade soaring up a hundred springs. Fairies dancing in the water and under the forest. ① Flying intention, surpassing two thousand years.
① The statues in the picture are mostly stories from Greek mythology

Full Court Fragrance
Attending Comrade Khrushchev's Ceremony for Receiving the Lenin International Peace Prize at the Kremlin
Cheers shake from all sides. Bright lights shine, and the jade steps are covered in red. Lenin's ambition is highly praised by the group, rockets soaring into the sky! Hundreds of millions of people united in heart to control the poisonous dragon, hundreds and thousands of flowers bloom together proudly in the east wind. Rejoicing that all the stars in the Arctic are arching. A thousand-autumn gathering, the Kremlin.

    曲六首　赵朴初
    天净沙
    莫斯科大学及地下铁道
    云墙高耸青天，雷车下彻黄泉。谁道茫茫不见？
    龙宫月阙，原来都在人间。
    又二首
    过拉脱维亚加盟共和国首都里加
    绿阴芳草人家，轻帆流水明霞，一幅江南图画。
    盘旋欲下，不知身到里加。
    飞鸿留迹瑶宫，此邦人物玲珑。永远心头供奉，
    多情迎送，名花美馔春浓。①
    ①机场上受拉脱维亚和平委员会同志殷勤接待。
    醉高歌带过米履曲
    为斯德哥尔摩作
    驾长虹桥影纵横，望碧树楼台掩映。海风来仙子应吹醒，喜芳草天涯人近。
    无战伐岂关天幸？百余年长享和平。五亿人为汝竞签名。①翩蹮鸥梦稳，浩荡海波清，愿人间欢乐永。
    ①指世界和平大会斯德哥尔摩宣言
    阳春曲
    游斯德哥尔摩雕刻师米勒氏花园
    海天胜处三弓剪，珠玉腾来百道泉。水中林下舞群仙。①飞动意，凌跨两千年。
    ①图中雕像多希腊神话故事
    满庭芳
    克里姆林宫参加赫鲁晓夫同志
    荣获列宁国际和平奖金典礼
    欢声四动。华灯耀彩，玉陛铺红。列宁志业群推重，火箭长空！亿万众同心制毒龙，百千花齐放傲东风。喜北极众星拱。千秋嘉会，克里姆林宫。
