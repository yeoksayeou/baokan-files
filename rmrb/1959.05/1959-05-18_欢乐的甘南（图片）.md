Joyful Gannan

The people of the Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture in Gansu Province are engaged in construction and production with great enthusiasm. On the beautiful Gannan grasslands, a thriving and unprecedented new atmosphere has emerged.

Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Tibetan and other ethnic groups in Gannan carried out democratic reforms in 1958, completely destroying the old feudal system. The long-suppressed revolutionary and construction enthusiasm of the broad masses of Tibetan people has been ignited. They enthusiastically signed up to join people's communes, set up factories on a large scale, built water conservancy projects, and actively developed industrial, agricultural, and pastoral production, which greatly developed the economy and culture of the autonomous prefecture. People's lives have also improved significantly. A group of young Tibetan workers capable of mastering modern production technologies has also grown rapidly.

Now, the various ethnic groups in the Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture are continuing to forge ahead valiantly along the victorious road of the Great Leap Forward of 1958.

	The capital of the Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture - "Hezuo" - is a brand new city built on the grasslands. The picture above shows a main street in "Hezuo" city.

	After the democratic reforms in the pastoral areas of Gannan, animal husbandry has developed rapidly. It is estimated that by the end of this year, the average person in the entire autonomous prefecture will have more than thirty large and small livestock. The picture shows a herd of horses grazing on the Gannan grasslands.

	Industry in the Gannan area has developed greatly, and there are now more than 6,000 large and small factories in the entire autonomous prefecture. This is the fully modernized Gannan Dairy Factory with an annual output of 3,000 tons, which has brought prosperity and happiness to the economic lives of the herdsmen.

	The "Gannan Song and Dance Troupe" created the song and dance drama "The Hearts of the Grassland People Blossom" to celebrate the democratic reforms and the people's communization, to express the joy of the herdsmen.

	Tibetan members of the Labrang People's Commune in Gannan are engaged in spring plowing.
