    Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, May 30th. The Indian "Free Press" published an editorial on the 29th entitled "The Fires of War in Indochina," reminding people to pay attention to the United States' conspiracy to endanger peace in Asia.

    The editorial, in discussing the various activities of the Lao Sananikone government under the instigation of the United States and the provocative actions of South Vietnam, said, "It is a horrifying conspiracy to ignite the fires of war throughout Indochina. The American imperialists want to light this fire and thus bring out the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization to 'protect' Laos. They are trying to spread the flames and thus transport the aggressive occupying forces of the United States into the whole of Indochina."

    The editorial also criticized Britain's opposition to reconvening the International Commission on Laos.

    The editorial said that the time when imperialists could arbitrarily launch colonial wars or reimpose the shackles of slavery on newly independent countries has passed.

    The editorial concluded by reminding India of its responsibility to Indochina as chairman of the International Commission, saying, "Among other responsible countries, the Soviet Union, China, and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam are all prepared to implement the Geneva Accords on Indochina. If our country works with them, then, just as the Indochina war was ended, and just as the Middle East aggression and occupation actions were defeated twice, the conspiracy to ignite the fires of war in Laos, Indochina, and the whole of Asia will also be defeated."

    印度“自由报”社论指出
    美国在老挝点火了
    新华社新德里30日电　印度“自由报”在29日发表的题为“印度支那的战火”的社论中提醒人们注意美国危害亚洲和平的阴谋。
    社论在谈到老挝萨纳尼空政府在美国唆使下进行的各种活动以及南越的挑衅行动时说，“在整个印度支那燃起战火来是一种骇人的阴谋。美帝国主义者想燃起这把火从而搬出东南亚条约组织对老挝的‘保护’。他们企图使火焰蔓延开来从而把美国侵略成性的占领军运入整个印度支那。”
    社论还抨击了英国反对重新召开老挝国际委员会的立场。
    社论说，帝国主义者能够随意发动殖民战争或者把奴隶的枷锁重新强加在刚独立的国家身上，这个时候已经过去了。
    社论最后在提醒印度注意身为国际委员会的主席对印度支那承担的责任时说，“在其他负有责任的国家中，苏联、中国和越南民主共和国都准备贯彻关于印度支那的日内瓦协议。如果我国同它们一起努力，那么，如结束印度支那战争一样，如两次击败中东侵略和占领行动一样，要想在老挝、印度支那和整个亚洲燃起战火的阴谋同样也将遭到失败。”
