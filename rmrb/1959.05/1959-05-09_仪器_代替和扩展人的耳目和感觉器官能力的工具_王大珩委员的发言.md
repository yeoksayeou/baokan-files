Instruments - Tools to Replace and Expand Human Senses

Speech by Committee Member Wang Daheng

Chairman, fellow committee members:

I fully endorse Premier Zhou Enlai's government work report and the reports of other leaders.

Regarding the treasonous actions of the reactionary elements of the upper class in Tibet, I fully support the central government's policy towards the Tibetan traitorous group. We are happy for the Tibetan people because this rebellion was quickly quelled, and the Tibetan people can be liberated more quickly from the dark serf society and move towards a bright and happy path. I express great indignation at the imperialist Britain and foreign reactionaries conspiring to split our country's Tibet and support the rebel group. Tibet is a part of China's territory, and suppressing the Tibetan rebellion is our country's internal affair, which brooks no interference from any outsiders. Any conspiracy is bound to be countered and crushed.

I am a scientific and technical worker engaged in instrument manufacturing research. Now I would like to say a few words about the development of my country's instrument industry:

The scope of instrument usage is extremely broad. In the struggle between mankind and nature, instruments are created as tools for observation and measurement in order to understand the laws of nature. When every scientific achievement is used to serve mankind, instruments also become tools for developing and improving production technology; and they are also used to improve the level of human cultural life. For example, we use measuring instruments, meteorological instruments, prospecting instruments, hydrological instruments, etc. to explore resources and transform nature. We use various physical and chemical instruments to study the structure of matter and to determine the physical properties and analyze the chemical composition of raw materials. We use instruments that measure various physical parameters to check the operating conditions in various production processes such as metallurgy, power, and chemistry, thereby ensuring the normal operation of production and ensuring the quality of products. In aviation flight, we use a large number of instruments to control flight and guide navigation routes. On the cultural front, we use various instruments to diagnose and treat diseases. Modern film, drama, music, and broadcasting industries also use various instruments extensively to obtain excellent results.

In national defense, the use of instruments occupies an important position.

In scientific research, instruments are the most important tools.

In short, instruments in various production and construction activities serve as tools to replace and expand the functions of human senses. And the development of modern science and technology, in many fast, continuous operations and automated production processes, instruments are comprehensively used to automatically coordinate operations between departments, doing systems that are beyond human capabilities, and used in environments that humans cannot approach (such as atomic energy equipment and high-temperature work). Just as humans use machinery to replace and expand human physical labor, instruments are being used to replace or expand the function of the human nervous system. Therefore, modern instruments widely use precision machinery, electrical engineering, electronics, optics, and even automation equipment, semiconductors, computing technology, and other scientific achievements. Complex instruments are often a synthesis of many sciences and technologies.

Our country has a glorious tradition in instrument creation since ancient times. The earliest ones include the compass, Zhang Heng's seismograph in the Later Han Dynasty, and more recent ones include the simplified instrument and the altazimuth created by Guo Shoujing in the Yuan Dynasty. Before liberation, due to the oppression and destruction of feudal rule and semi-colonial society, the budding of China's modern instrument industry, although it existed more than fifty years ago, did not develop much. Until the eve of liberation, only a few repair and small-scale production factories in a few large coastal cities could manufacture some instruments such as balances, pressure gauges, thermometers, electric meters, and simple microscopes. After liberation, due to the impact of the rapid development of the national economy and the attention paid to the instrument industry by the Party and the state, the blank appearance of China's instrument and meter industry has been changed, and great development has been achieved. By 1956, nearly four hundred large and small factories developed from the foundations before liberation in Shanghai, Tianjin, Guangzhou, Shenyang, Kunming, and other places. In order to develop the instrument industry, the state began to build several modern factories producing electric meters, thermal instruments, and optical instruments. The Eighth National Congress of the Communist Party of China in 1956 also instructed that the instrument and meter industry must be listed as one of the key points of mechanical industry development. The state established a special agency to manage the instrument and meter industry. During the socialist three major transformations, many private small factories were organized and rectified. Thanks to the correct leadership of the Party, the enthusiasm of those engaged in instrument manufacturing has been unprecedentedly enhanced, and development has been unusually rapid. For example, a certain factory in Shanghai engaged in the production of thermal instruments had less than four hundred people in 1956 and could only produce one thousand sets of thermal instruments. By 1957, it had increased to two thousand and fifty-six sets. In 1958, the factory was relocated and rebuilt, and its scale has exceeded one thousand people. In 1957, the output value of national instrument production was 3.4 times that of 1952. The variety has increased significantly, and the technical level has also been significantly improved. Products with slightly higher precision can now be produced.

Many research institutions engaged in instrument and meter research have also been established successively. The earliest established after liberation was the instrument museum of the Academy of Sciences, which is now the Institute of Optics and Precision Mechanics. The Academy of Sciences system also has an automation research institute closely related to instrument manufacturing. In the industrial sector, there is the Thermal Instrument Research Institute, as well as other research institutions engaged in the research and trial production of precision instruments, electrical instruments, material testing machines, and medical instruments. Various professional departments specializing in instrument and meter manufacturing have also been set up in universities.

In 1958, under the brilliant illumination of the Party's general line, the national industry and agriculture leaped forward in an all-round way, and 1958 was also a year of great leap forward for the instrument and meter industry. The output value of instruments and meters in 1958 was 2.75 times that of 1957, and ten times that of 1952. Many varieties have begun to transition from single small-batch production to batch or mass production, and have begun to supply in complete sets. For example, it can produce complete sets of instruments and control equipment used in power plants. Many factories, research institutions, and schools, under the encouragement of emancipating the mind and breaking superstitions, boldly attacked several technical fortresses in instrument manufacturing and successfully trial-produced thousands of new varieties. Among them, as many as 1,500 types have been adopted by the production department and are ready to be put into production. These new varieties have filled many gaps in instrument production; and have demonstrated many cutting-edge achievements. For example, electron microscopes, complete sets of electronic regulators for large power stations, universal tool microscopes, first-class triangulation theodolites, zero-point first-class electric meters, dynamic and static resistance strain gauges, large-scale spectrometers, large-scale metal diffusion pumps, and radioactive logging instruments have all been successfully trial-produced. Some of these products already contain the nature of independent design.

At the same time, under the guidance of the Party's several "simultaneous development" policies, last year, in addition to the relatively well-established factories expanding or expanding their construction, thanks to the active support of the Party and government leaders in various provinces and cities for the instrument and meter industry, many new instrument and meter factories have emerged in various provinces and cities, many of which have quickly been put into production.

In the instrument industry, mobilizing the masses, carrying out technical revolutions, and improving many tools and technological technologies, and adopting a combination of indigenous and foreign methods to arm production equipment. This has played a positive role in improving productivity, improving product quality, and expanding varieties.

The great leap forward in instrument and meter industry and science and technology in 1958 laid the foundation for continuing to go all out this year and achieving a greater leap forward. And it has made a good start for rapidly building a complete instrument and meter industrial system suitable for all aspects of construction across the country in the next few years.

Generally speaking, the development of China's instrument and meter industry is rapid, but due to the excessively weak foundation in the past, the current output, variety, and quality are far from meeting the needs of China's production and construction and scientific and technological development. We can now only equip complete sets of equipment under construction with the minimum number of instruments. For the production of general medium-precision instruments, the quality can be basically guaranteed, but the variety and variety are not enough. For instruments required to be serialized, there is often a lack of varieties with extreme performance at both ends. Some high-precision and complex comprehensive technology instruments can now be manufactured sporadically, but production technology still needs to be stabilized and improved. New technologies such as automated electronics and semiconductors have not been applied to the extent they should be. In addition, the organization and management of production order needs to be greatly strengthened. The industrial layout is still not balanced, whether from the perspective of product type or regional distribution. The instrument and meter industry is still relatively backward compared to China's entire machinery industry. Therefore, we must strive to catch up and rapidly strengthen the young instrument and meter industry.

Below, I would like to talk about a few issues:

I. The whole country is a chessboard, and the development of the instrument and meter industry is planned as a whole. The task of the instrument and meter industry must be to manufacture a sufficient number and variety of instruments to serve the development of production, construction, and science and technology according to the Party's general line of building socialism. To this end, in terms of technology, it is also required to establish a complete industrial system as soon as possible. Based on the complexity of instrument and meter manufacturing technology and the wide range of service objects, comprehensive planning for instrument and meter production is very necessary, and the layout of China's instrument and meter industry must be determined as early as possible based on China's industrial and economic conditions. At present, a large part of China's instrument industry has been assigned to the leadership of provinces and cities. Under the active leadership of the Party and government in various places, it has played a great role in accelerating the development of the instrument and meter industry. But one very important point is to include the development of instrument and meter production in various places into the national instrument industry development plan. So as not to cause a disconnect between production and demand, some types of instruments are made too much, while others become blank. Some technically complex products do not need to be produced in every region due to the small demand; planning can avoid unnecessary duplication and cause waste of human and material resources. Through proper arrangements, technical collaboration can also be effectively organized in different regions.

At present, for the needs of certain types of instruments, improving the technical level and increasing the production variety of advanced instruments are more urgent than increasing the production quantity of general instruments. Therefore, in the development of industry, more attention must be paid to the growth of technical strength.

II. Put the trial products into production quickly. Many trial products were made in the great leap forward last year. These trial products must be put into production as soon as possible according to the urgency of the needs. Generally, from trial production to normal production, a technical consolidation, proficiency, and transfer process is required, and further standardization of technology, preparation of tools, guarantee of raw material sources, establishment of inspection equipment, and a series of technical issues need to be resolved. Through the solution of these problems, the trial products can be put into production. On the one hand, it can meet the needs, and on the other hand, it can greatly improve the technical level.

III. Attach importance to the selection of instruments and the standardization and serialization of instruments and meters. Due to the large variety of instruments and the very messy specifications of existing instruments internationally, in order to simplify instrument production and require the minimum variety to meet the needs of use to the greatest extent, we must carefully select models and determine the standard series of instruments.

In recent years, due to the development of automation technology in the production process, a direction has been proposed for modern instrument manufacturing, that is, the use of unit combination for complex and comprehensive instrument systems. This requires the components of various instruments to be serialized and standardized, so that various different components can be assembled like building blocks according to the functions required by the instrument system. In this way, a limited number of instrument units can be used to obtain a variety of instrument equipment. Standardization and serialization can also facilitate mass production of instruments and meters, ensure quality, and reduce costs. When the instrument is damaged, it is also easy to repair and replace. The design of the instrument can also be greatly simplified as a result. Because standardization and serialization can reduce the cost of instruments, instruments can be used more widely in various production processes to achieve the goal of building socialism more, faster, better, and more economically. In the great leap forward last year, the issue of standardization and serialization of thermal instruments and automatic control regulating instruments was fully discussed at professional meetings, which gained the unanimous attention of manufacturers and users, and preliminary measures were determined. This is a good start for the realization of instrument standardization and serialization in China, and it is of great significance. In the future, a lot of work must be done on the standardization and serialization of instruments, and it must be extended to other types of instruments.

IV. Ensure the quality of instruments and meters. Instruments and meters not only need to have a certain degree of accuracy, but more importantly, they must be able to maintain their accuracy for a long time during use. If the instrument cannot maintain accuracy and is used to control the production process, it will be a great deviation, which can cause significant economic losses; if used for scientific research, it can lead to incorrect conclusions. Ensuring the quality of instruments, one is the correct design and construction of the instrument, and the other is metrological verification. At present, the production of general instruments in China can basically guarantee the quality. However, in some factories where the production order is not yet very sound, the quality inspection of products is sometimes not fully understood. Under the leadership of the National Bureau of Metrology, metrological verification work is being vigorously carried out, but it has not yet reached the point where metrological verification can be carried out for all varieties of instruments produced. Therefore, in order to ensure the production quality of instruments and meters, on the one hand, we must mobilize the masses, attach importance to quality ideologically, and in production, the guarantee of quality should be checked and supervised by the masses, and at the same time, the technical conditions of production units, metrology institutions, scientific research institutions, universities, and user units should be fully utilized, so that the produced instruments can be fully technically verified. Recently, in the production of a certain type of instrument, the relevant major user organization organized a quality verification committee for this type of instrument. This committee will organize technical verification of new instruments and supervise the quality of currently produced instruments, which is a measure to ensure production quality that is worth referring to.

V. Strengthen the production of raw materials and original parts. At present, a prominent problem in instrument production is the lack of special raw materials and special original parts for instrument manufacturing. Some trial products cannot be put into production quickly, also because they are restricted by the supply of original parts and raw materials. These raw materials and original parts are not large in number in terms of volume and weight. However, there are many types, and some require very high quality, such as thermocouple alloys and spring diaphragm boxes, and their quality directly determines the quality of the instruments made. Some of these original parts and raw materials need to be produced in close coordination with the metallurgical department, the electrical and electronic device manufacturing department, etc. However, a large part of them must be produced by the instrument industry itself. In recent years, the instrument and meter industry has solved many problems of raw materials and original parts for itself, such as optical glass, resistance materials, permanent magnet materials, etc. In order to be less restricted by the source of materials and original parts, the instrument and meter industry must continue to get rid of the simple "assembly" or "stir-fry" production method, and list the preparation of many raw materials and original parts as its basic task. For the varieties that have been produced, the quality is required to be further improved, and the output is expanded accordingly according to the needs. And because many raw materials or original parts require a small amount but the technical requirements are more complicated, production units must communicate with each other technically, and exchange products with each other to avoid duplication and save technical strength. In the current situation where the supply and demand of raw materials and original parts are not balanced, in addition to vigorously increasing the production of raw materials and original parts, the limited number of raw materials and original parts must be used to manufacture the instruments and meters that the country urgently needs.

VI. Strengthen coordination and collaboration, and give full play to technical potential. The current instrument and meter production task should be combined with steel as the key and the four major indicators of steel, coal, grain, and cotton as the center, first ensuring the needs of key construction tasks and ensuring the completion of overall tasks. At present, a large part of the national instrument industry is under the leadership of local authorities. Therefore, it is necessary to coordinate the quantity and variety of production tasks and new product trial production tasks on a national scale according to the importance and urgency. In the past, coordination was carried out on a national scale in the production and trial production of thermal instruments and optical instruments, and good results were achieved. In the future, this coordination should continue to be strengthened and extended to other instrument fields.

Last year, in the great leap forward that appeared in scientific and technological work and in universities, many modern instruments were made, some of which were carried out in cooperation with production units, which has greatly improved the level of instrument manufacturing. Based on this experience, the cooperation between production units and scientific and technological institutions and universities should continue to be strengthened to tap technical potential and make up for the lack of technical strength of the instrument itself. And this can form a scientific and technological collaboration team centered on the instrument manufacturing industry, which will play a great role in accelerating the improvement of the level of the instrument manufacturing industry. This team is needed not only now, but also in the future when the instrument and meter industry has been fully developed.

VII. Strengthen scientific research work. The ultimate goal of engaging in instrument scientific research is to manufacture instruments that serve production and construction. The achievements of the Great Leap Forward tell us that in instrument manufacturing technology, we can quickly move from mastering the existing to the road of independent design. In fact, the trial production of some instruments has embarked on the path of technical independence. To this end, in carrying out research work related to instruments, in addition to carrying out instrument trial production, attention must also be paid to the research of unit technology and basic problems, solving key technological problems, and preparing the necessary scientific data for the design of new instruments as a basis for design. In addition, we must apply emerging science and technology as soon as possible, especially new achievements such as electronics, semiconductors, radioactive isotopes, ultrasonic waves, and photoelectric methods, to improve the efficiency of instruments and develop automation technology, so that China can fully reach the modern level in instrument and meter manufacturing. We also need to engage in the research of instruments suitable for China's climate conditions and resource conditions. In order to meet the requirements of China's small and medium-sized enterprises, combined with the needs of the technical revolution of the broad masses, the design and manufacture of simple, reliable, and inexpensive instruments is also an indispensable task that must be carried out quickly.

VIII. Cadre training. At present, many universities have set up various instrument and meter majors, and some have had several classes of graduates who serve in various positions in the instrument industry, but the number is small. Many majors have not been set up for a long time, and graduates will not be available until 1961 to 1963, which cannot keep up with the needs of the developing instrument and meter industry in the current leap forward. To this end, we must take various effective measures, use all the forces that can be used in schools, research institutes, and factories to accelerate the training of technical cadres, in order to meet the urgent needs of the leaping development of the current instrument and meter industry. The training of skilled technicians also takes time, so it must be given attention.

We are confident that under the brilliant illumination of the Party's general line, in the torrent of continuing to go all out and making a comprehensive leap forward, China's instrument and meter industry will surely achieve faster and more comprehensive development, change the backward appearance, and establish a strong and advanced industrial and scientific and technological team, from quantity, variety, and scientific and technological level to meet the growing needs of production, construction, and scientific research for instruments and meters, thereby ensuring that China's industry, agriculture, science, and technology catch up with the advanced countries in the world.

The above are some immature opinions of individuals, I hope to give criticism and correction.

　　仪器——代替和扩展人的耳目和感觉器官能力的工具
    王大珩委员的发言主席、各位委员：
    我完全拥护周恩来总理的政府工作报告和其他各位首长的报告。
    对于西藏上层反动分子叛国事件，我完全拥护中央对西藏叛国集团所采取的方针。我们为西藏人民高兴，因为这次叛乱迅速得到平定，西藏人民可以更快地从黑暗的农奴社会中解放出来，走向光明幸福之路。对于英帝国主义和外国反动派阴谋分裂我国西藏，支持叛乱集团，表示极大的愤慨。西藏是中国领土的一部分，平息西藏叛乱是我国的内政，不容任何外人干涉。任何阴谋，必然受到回击，遭到粉碎。
    我是一个从事仪器制造研究工作的科学技术人员。现在我就发展我国仪器工业讲几句话：
    仪器的使用范围是极其广泛的，在人类与自然作斗争中，仪器是为了理解自然界的规律作为观察和测量的工具而创造出来的。当每种科学上的成就被利用来为人类服务的时候，仪器也随着成为发展和提高生产技术的工具；并且还用来提高人类的文化生活水平。例如，我们利用测量仪器、气象仪器、探矿仪器、水力水文仪器等来勘察资源，改造自然的工作。我们利用各种物理和化学仪器来研究物质的结构并对原材料的性能进行物理性质的测定和化学成份的分析。我们利用测量各种物理参数的仪表来检查冶金、动力和化学等各种生产过程中的运行情况，从而保证生产的正常运行并且保证产品的质量。在航空飞行中我们利用大量的仪表来操纵飞行并指导航行的路线。在文化战线上我们用各种仪器来诊断和医疗疾病。现代的电影、戏剧、音乐、广播事业也都大量的使用各种仪器以得到优良的效果。
    在国防上，仪器的使用占着重要的地位。
    在科学研究上，仪器是最主要的工具。
    总之，仪器在各种生产建设上，是作为代替和扩展人的耳目和感觉器官功能的工具。而现代科学技术的发展，在许多快速、连续操作以及自动化的生产过程中，仪器被综合的利用来自动协调各部门间的操作，干着超乎人的能力所能操纵的系统，以及使用于人所不能接近的环境（例如原子能设备和高温工作）。正如人类用机械来代替并扩展人的体力劳动，仪器正在用来代替或扩展人的神经系统的作用。因此，近代的仪器，广泛地应用着精密机械、电学、电子学、光学，以至于自动化装备、半导体、计算技术等各方面的科学成就。复杂的仪器常是许多门科学技术的综合体。
    我国古代对于仪器上的创造，原有着光辉的传统。最早的有如指南针、后汉张衡的地震仪，比较近期的有如元朝郭守敬创造的简仪、仰仪等精密天文仪器。解放以前，由于受到封建统治和半殖民地社会的压抑和摧残，我国现代仪器工业的萌芽，虽然五十多年前已经有了，但没有得到多大的发展。直至解放前夕，仅在沿海几个大城市中有些修配和小规模的生产工厂，能制造一些天秤、压力表、温度计、电表、简单显微镜等仪器。解放之后，由于国民经济迅速发展的影响，并得到党及国家对于仪器工业的重视，已改变了我国仪器仪表工业空白的面貌，得到了很大发展。至一九五六年，在上海、天津、广州、沈阳、昆明等地，从解放前基础上发展起来的大小工厂已近四百多个。国家为了发展仪表工业，开始新建了几个现代化的生产电表、热工仪表、光学仪器等工厂。一九五六年中国共产党第八次代表大会上又指示必须把仪器仪表工业列为机械工业发展重点之一。国家成立了专门管理仪器仪表工业的机构。在社会主义三大改造期间，又对许多私营小厂进行了组织整顿。由于党的正确领导，从事仪器制造工作者的积极性空前提高，发展异常迅速。例如上海从事热工仪表生产的某厂，在一九五六年不到四百人，仅能生产一千套热工仪表，至一九五七年即增长到二千零五十六套，一九五八年迁厂新建，规模已在千人以上。一九五七年全国仪表生产的产值为一九五二年的三点四倍。品种有显著的增加，技术水平也有显著提高，已能生产精度稍高的产品。
    许多从事仪器仪表的研究机构也相继建立起来。解放后成立最早的有科学院的仪器馆，现在则成为光学精密机械仪器研究所。在科学院系统中还设有与仪器制造有密切关系的自动化研究所。在产业部门有热工仪表研究所，以及其他研究机构从事精密仪器、电工仪表、材料试验机械、医疗仪器等的研究试制工作。在高等学校中也设置了专门从事仪器仪表制造的各种专业科系。
    一九五八年在党的总路线的光辉照耀下，全国工农业全面大跃进，对于仪器仪表工业也是大跃进的一年。一九五八的仪器仪表产值为一九五七年的二点七五倍。为一九五二年的十倍。不少品种，已开始由单个小批生产准备转为成批或大量生产，并且走上成套供应。例如能生产发电站所用成套仪表及控制装备。许多工厂、研究机构、学校在解放思想破除迷信的鼓舞之下，大胆进攻仪器制造上的若干技术堡垒，试制成功了数以千计的新品种。其中已被生产部门采纳，准备投入生产的即达一千五百种之多。这些新品种，填补了仪器生产中的许多空白；并且表现了许多尖端性的成就。如电子显微镜，大型电站用的成套电子调节器，万能工具显微镜，一等三角测量用经纬仪，零点一级电表，动静态电阻应变仪，大型光谱仪，大型金属扩散泵，放射性测井仪等都已试制成功。其中一部分产品已包含着独立设计的性质。
    同时，在党的几个“并举”政策的指导之下，去年除了比较有基础的工厂都进行了扩大或扩建而外，由于得到各省市党政领导对于仪器仪表工业的积极支持，在各省市又出现了不少新建的仪器仪表工厂，其中有许多厂很快地就投入了生产。
    在仪器工业中发动群众，大闹技术革命，改进了许多工具和工艺技术，并且采用了土洋结合的方法来武装生产设备。这对于提高生产率、提高产品质量、扩大品种等等都起了积极的作用。
    一九五八年在仪器仪表工业和科学技术上的大跃进，为本年继续鼓足干劲，实现更大的跃进打下了基础。并且为在最近几年内在全国范围内迅速地建成完整的，与各方面建设相适宜的仪器仪表工业体系，作了良好的开端。
    总的说来，我国仪器仪表工业的发展是迅速的，但是，由于过去的基础过于薄弱，目前无论在产量、品种和质量上说，还远不能适应我国生产建设和科学技术发展的需要。我们现在仅仅能以最低限度的仪表，来装备建设中的成套设备。对于生产一般中精度的仪器，基本上能保证质量，但花样和品种还不够多。对于要求成为系列的仪表，往往缺少两头具有极端性能的品种。现在能零星地制造一些高级精度和复杂的具有综合性技术的仪器，但在生产技术上还需要稳定提高。自动化电子学以及半导体等新技术，还没有应用到应有的广泛程度。此外在生产秩序上还需要大大加强组织管理。工业布局，无论从产品类型和地区分布来说，都还不够平衡。仪器仪表工业，目前和我国整个机械工业相对说来，也还是比较落后的。因此，必须奋起直追，把年青的仪器仪表工业迅速地壮大起来。
    下面，我想就几个问题谈一谈：
    一、全国一盘棋，统筹安排仪器仪表工业的发展。仪器仪表工业的任务，必须是根据党的建设社会主义的总路线，以制出足够数量的，多种多样的仪器服务于生产建设和科学技术的发展。为此，在技术上还要求能尽速地建立成一个完整的工业体系。基于仪器仪表在制造技术上的复杂性以及广泛的服务对象，对于仪器仪表生产的全面规划是很必要的，也必须及早的根据我国工业和经济条件，确定我国仪器仪表工业的布局。目前我国的仪表工业，很大部分已划归省市领导，在各地党政的积极领导下，对于加速发展仪器仪表工业起了很大作用。但是很重要的一点，是把各地对仪器仪表生产的发展，纳入全国仪表工业发展规划之内。使不致造成生产和需要上的脱节，有些类型的仪表造多了，而有些成为空白。某些在技术上很复杂的产品，由于需要量不大，不需要每个地区都进行生产；通过规划就可避免不必要的重复，造成人力物力上的浪费。通过妥善安排，还可有效地在不同地区内组织技术上的协作。
    目前对于某些类型仪器需要的情况来说，提高技术水平，增加高级仪器的生产品种比增加一般仪器的生产数量更为迫切。因此在发展工业上，就必须更多地注意技术力量的增长。
    二、把试制品迅速投入生产。去年大跃进中制成了许多种试制品。必须根据需要的迫切程度，尽快地将这些试制品投入生产。一般从试制品进入正常生产，还需经过一个技术上的巩固，熟练与传授过程，也还需要解决工艺上的进一步规范化，工具的制备，原材料来源的保证，建立检验设备等等一系列的技术问题。通过这些问题的解决，使试制品投入生产。一方面可以满足需要，同时可以大大提高技术水平。
    三、重视仪器的选型和仪器仪表的标准化系列化工作。由于仪器的品种繁多，而国际上现有仪器在规格上非常杂乱，我们为了简化仪器的生产，要求以最少的品种最大限度地满足使用的需要，就必须慎重的选型并确定仪器的规范系列。
    近年来由于生产过程自动化技术的发展，给近代仪器制造提出了一个方向，就是对于复杂的综合性的仪表系统采用单元组合的形式。这里要求各种仪器的组件系列化标准化，使各种不同组件根据仪表系统所要求的功能，能如积木板那样的拼搭起来。这样就可以以有限的仪表单元，得出多种多样的仪表装备。标准化系列化还可使仪器仪表便于大量生产，保证质量，降低成本。仪器有损坏时也易于进行修理更换。仪器的设计也可因此而大为简化。由于标准化系列化可以使仪表的成本降低，因此可以更广泛地使用仪表于各种生产过程以达到多快好省地建设社会主义的目的。去年大跃进中，对于热工仪表与自动化控制调节仪表的标准化系列化问题在专业会议上得到了充分的讨论，取得了制造者和使用者一致的重视，并初步定出了措施。这是在我国实现仪器标准化系列化的一个良好开端，意义很大。今后还须要在仪器的标准化系列化上进行很多工作，并推广到别种类型的仪器上去。
    四、保证仪器仪表的质量。仪器仪表不但要求具有一定的精确度，更重要的是要在使用时能长期保持他的精确度。仪表而不能保持准确，用来控制生产过程，真是会失之毫厘差之千里，可以造成重大的经济损失；用于科学研究可以得出不正确的结论。保证仪表的质量，一个是仪器的正确设计与施工，一个是计量检定。目前国内对于一般仪器的生产，基本上能够保证质量。但在若干生产秩序还不十分健全的工厂中，对于产品的质量检查，有时还认识得不够全面。计量检定工作，目前在国家计量局的领导下正在大力开展，但还没有达到能够对所有生产仪器的品种都进行计量检定的地步。因此，为了保证仪器仪表的生产质量，一方面须发动群众，从思想上重视质量，在生产中对于保证质量得到群众性的检查和督促，同时应充分利用生产单位，计量机构、科学研究机构、高等学校，以及使用单位等的技术条件，使生产的仪器得到充分的技术检定。最近在某类仪器的生产上，由有关主要使用机构，组织了对这类仪器的质量检定委员会。这个委员会将对新型仪器组织技术检定并对现产仪器质量进行监督，这是一个保证生产质量的值得参考的措施。
    五、加强原材料和原件的生产。目前仪表生产上的一个突出问题，是仪器制造用特殊原材料和特殊原件的不足。有些试制品不能很快投入生产，也是因为受到原件、原材料供应上的限制。这些原材料和原件，就体积和重量说，数量是不大的。但是种类繁多，有的要求质量很高，例如热电偶合金，弹簧膜盒，他们的质量直接决定着制成仪器的质量。这些原件及原材料有一部分需要由冶金部门、电学和电子学器件制造部门等密切配合生产。但也有很大部分，须在仪器工业内自己进行生产。几年来在仪器仪表工业中，已为自己解决了不少原料和原件的问题，例如光学玻璃、电阻材料、永磁材料等等。为了少受材料原件来源的限制，在仪器仪表工业中，必需继续摆脱那种单纯的“装配式”或是“炒菜式”的生产方式，把许多原料及原件的制备列为自己的基本任务。已生产的品种要求在质量上进一步提高，在产量上根据需要，相应的扩大，并由于许多原料或原件需要的数量不多而技术要求比较复杂，在生产单位间必须在技术上互相通气，在产品上互通有无，避免重复，以节约技术力量。在目前原料和原件供求不够平衡的情况下，除了大力增加原料和原件的生产而外，必须把有限数量的原料和原件用在制造国家最迫切需要的仪器仪表上面。
    六、加强协调与协作，充分发挥技术潜力。当前仪器仪表的生产任务应当是结合以钢为纲以钢煤粮棉四大指标为中心，首先保证重点建设任务的需要，保证全局性任务的完成。目前全国仪器工业，很大部分划归地方领导，因此，对于生产任务以及新产品试制任务，有必要就数量品种，根据轻重缓急，在全国范围内进行协调。过去，在热工仪表和光学仪器的生产和试制上，曾就全国范围进行协调，取得了良好的效果。今后这种协调应继续加强，并推广到其他各种仪表领域。
    去年在科学技术工作上以及在高等学校中所出现的大跃进中，制出了不少现代化的仪器，其中有些工作是与生产单位协作进行的，对于提高仪器制造的水平，已起了很大的效果。根据这个经验，应继续加强生产单位与科学技术机构以及高等学校内的协作，挖掘技术潜力，以补仪器仪表本身技术力量的不足。并且由此可以形成一支围绕着仪器制造工业为中心的科学技术协作队伍，这将会对加速提高仪器制造的工业的水平，起很大作用。这支队伍，非但现在需要，就是在将来仪器仪表工业已充分发展了，也还是需要的。
    七、加强科学研究工作。从事仪器科学研究的最终目的，就是为了制出服务于生产建设的仪器。大跃进的成就告诉我们，在仪器制造技术上我们很快就可以从掌握已有的向独立设计的道路迈进。事实上有些仪器的试制已经走上了技术独立的途径。为此进行有关仪器的研究工作，除了进行仪器的试制而外，还必须注意单元技术和基本问题的研究，解决关键性的工艺问题，并为设计新型仪器准备必要的科学数据，作为设计的依据。此外，我们还须尽快地应用新兴科学技术，特别是电子学、半导体、放射性同位素、超声波、光电方法等新成就，以提高仪器的效能，发展自动化技术使我国在仪器仪表制造上完全达到现代化的水平。我们也须要从事适应于我国气候条件以及资源条件的仪器的研究。为了满足我国中小型企业的要求，结合广大群众技术革命上的需要，设计制造简易可靠而价廉的仪表也是不可忽视而必须从速进行的工作。
    八、干部培养。目前很多高等学校已设置了各种仪器仪表专业，有的已有了几班毕业生，服务于仪器工业的各个岗位上，但数量不多。许多专业都是设置未久，须至一九六一年至一九六三年才有毕业生，赶不上目前跃进中发展仪器仪表工业的需要。为此必须采取各种有效措施，利用学校、研究所、工厂中一切可以利用的力量，加速技术干部的培养，以济当前仪器仪表工业跃进发展的急需。对于熟练技工的培养，也是需要时间的，因此必须予以重视。
    我们确信，在党的总路线的光辉照耀之下、在继续鼓足干劲全面大跃进的洪流中，我国的仪器仪表工业一定也能取得更迅速而全面的发展，改变落后的面貌，建立一支强大的先进的工业和科学技术队伍，从数量、品种和科学技术水平上满足生产建设和科学研究对仪器仪表的日益增长的需要，从而保证我国工农业和科学技术方面赶上世界先进国家。
    以上是个人的一些不成熟的意见，希予批评指正。
