Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 16th. A correspondent from this agency accompanying the army reported: Inspired by the People's Liberation Army's policy of lenient treatment of prisoners, more than 800 scattered bandits fleeing in the Shannan area of Tibet have surrendered their weapons to the People's Liberation Army. The People's Liberation Army provided the surrendered personnel with food, tea, cigarettes, and clothing. The wounded and sick were treated. Those whose homes were in the local area were immediately released to return home to work. Those who lived far away were organized and sent back to their original homes.

The People's Liberation Army's policy of lenient treatment of prisoners has been supported by the broad masses of the Tibetan people. Many Tibetan compatriots and relatives of the rebel bandits have voluntarily assisted the People's Liberation Army in appealing to scattered bandits to surrender. A resident of Damo, Bazhu, heard that there were two "lamas" on the mountain asking for tsampa to eat. He brought the two "lamas" over, publicized the PLA's policy of lenient treatment of prisoners to them. They admitted that they were rebel bandits who had fled from the Little Jokhang Temple in Lhasa. Bazhu then led the two rebel bandits to the local PLA garrison to surrender. The wife of rebel bandit Puba brought her husband and her husband's younger brother to surrender to the PLA, and handed over a hidden pistol. Many prisoners who received lenient treatment also voluntarily went into the deep mountains and dense forests to find scattered bandits to surrender. In Qonggyai County, two released prisoners persuaded six hidden scattered bandits to surrender. In Tangxu, more than 100 scattered bandits surrendered to the PLA; in Qonggyai County, within less than ten days, 239 rebel bandits surrendered to the PLA.

Among the rebel bandits who surrendered to the People's Liberation Army, many were lamas who had participated in the rebellion. After they laid down their weapons, they were all released. Among the rebel bandits who surrendered in Nedong County, 28 were lamas from the Ritrukyab Ling Monastery near Nedong.

In Cona County, where the rebel bandits finally collapsed, the Tibetan people who participated in the rebellion or were coerced into it have all surrendered to the People's Liberation Army and reunited with their families at home. Many of them, to express their gratitude for the PLA's leniency, actively sent firewood and grass to the PLA, transported materials, and helped the PLA grind flour.

    新华社拉萨16日电　本社随军记者报道：在人民解放军平叛大军的宽待俘虏政策的感召下，逃窜在西藏山南地区的散匪，已有八百多名向人民解放军缴械投诚。人民解放军对于投诚人员，发给了食物、茶叶、纸烟和衣服，对伤病人员还进行了治疗，家在当地的立即释放回家生产，离家远的就组织起来，遣散回原籍。
    人民解放军宽待俘虏的政策，得到了广大西藏人民的拥护，许多藏胞和叛匪亲属自动协助人民解放军招降散匪，达木的居民巴珠听说山上有两个“喇嘛”要糌粑吃，他便把两个“喇嘛”找来，向他们宣传解放军宽待俘虏的政策，他们承认是从拉萨小昭寺逃跑的叛匪，巴珠就领着这两个叛匪到驻在当地的解放军处投诚。叛匪普巴的妻子，把她的丈夫和丈夫的弟弟找来，带他们向解放军投降，并把隐藏的一支小手枪交出。许多受到宽大处理的俘虏，也自动到深山密林中找寻散匪来投降。在琼结宗，有两个被释放的俘虏，招降了六个隐藏的散匪。在当许有一百多名散匪向解放军投诚；逃散在琼结宗境内的叛匪，不到十天就有二百三十九人向解放军投诚。
    向人民解放军投降的叛匪中，有许多是参加叛乱的喇嘛，当他们放下武器后，都被释放。在乃东宗投诚的叛匪中，有二十八人是乃东附近的瑞交林寺的喇嘛。
    在叛匪最后溃散的错那宗地方，参加叛乱和被裹胁的藏民，都已经向人民解放军投诚，并且回家和家人团聚。其中有许多人为了感激解放军对他们的宽大，还积极给解放军送柴送草，运送物资，帮助解放军磨面。
