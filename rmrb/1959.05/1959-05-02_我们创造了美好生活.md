Comrade Chairman, fellow representatives of the Great Leap Forward of the Xiyou People's Commune in Yexian County, Shandong:

I have been greatly enlightened, educated, and encouraged by Premier Zhou's report and the reports of the leaders. I fully endorse these reports and will resolutely implement them in my future work. Recently, imperialists and Indian expansionists have attempted to split Tibet from the motherland's big family, nonsensically claiming "Tibetan independence," which makes me extremely angry. Tibet is an inseparable part of our country, and no one can change this. Their sinful activities are deliberately undermining our country's unity and the solidarity of all ethnic groups, openly challenging the 600 million Chinese people. I want to warn the imperialists and Indian expansionists that the days when China could be bullied are long gone. You truly do not know Mount Tai when you see it and insist on hitting a stone with an egg. If you do not stop your conspiracies and continue to be enemies of the Chinese people, you will surely suffer a bloody nose.

Now, I will briefly report to the conference on the situation of the production Great Leap Forward in our Xiyou People's Commune in Yexian County, Shandong in 1958.

Our commune was originally composed of twenty agricultural cooperatives and one fishing cooperative, including thirty-five natural villages, 10,100 households, 39,170 people, and 64,000 mu of land. During the Great Leap Forward in 1958, under the leadership of the Party at higher levels, our commune launched one production upsurge after another, starting in the spring. Cadres and the masses worked hard day and night, and for more than a year, they have always been full of energy. Therefore, we have achieved great results in production. Compared with a year ago, our place has undergone great changes. In agriculture, although we encountered an unprecedented and severe drought that had not been seen for decades, the commune's grain production still reached 621 jin per mu. Among them, the Houlu Production Brigade (formerly our small advanced cooperative) averaged 1,314 jin and 11 liang per mu. Last year, not only did we have a bumper harvest in agriculture, but we also implemented the combination of industry and agriculture according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and we also achieved great results in industrial production. We used indigenous methods to smelt more than 140 tons of iron and 96 tons of steel, and we established many small-scale industries, including machinery factories, chemical factories, building materials factories, paper mills, candy factories, and non-staple food processing factories, etc., which can produce wind-powered waterwheels, threshers, electric motors, wooden boats, and more than 200 kinds of agricultural tools and other products. The total industrial output value for the year reached 680,000 yuan, an increase of 41.8 percent compared to 1957. After we established the commune, we also actively developed cultural, educational, health, and welfare undertakings according to the needs of the masses. We established one middle school, one half-work half-study Red and Expert School, three private middle schools, and four half-work half-study agricultural middle schools, with more than 1,000 people participating in the study. More than 400 people have graduated from literacy classes. There is also one central hospital, ten health stations, two homes for the elderly, fifteen kindergartens, and more than eighty nurseries. These are all things that we could not do in the past, but now we have done them. The commune members are truly overjoyed and extremely happy. Some commune members sang: "In the past, when I sang songs, I was worried about money and rice. Now is a truly good time, with plenty of food and clothing, I am happy. After working, I rest and sing, and my throat itches if I don't sing for three days."

Why were we able to achieve such great results? The commune members all say: Thanks to Chairman Mao and the leadership of the Party at higher levels.

Setting up camp in the fields, fighting drought and reaping a bumper harvest

Since the spring of 1958, we have experienced a drought in our area. It has not rained thoroughly for more than half a year. When the wheat was dry, we watered it several times in a row, and we managed to get through the first hurdle. At that time, it was still a small advanced cooperative, and the average wheat yield per mu reached 430 jin. However, it was difficult to handle after the wheat harvest. The drought became more and more serious, the ground dried more than a foot deep, and it was impossible to plow. Some small trees dried up their leaves, and although some of the spring-sown crops were watered, they were generally yellowing. Some of the leaves were curled up, and some were lying on the ground. Some of the summer-sown crops that had already been sown died due to drought, and most of them were about to miss the sowing time. At that time, the river had dried up, and most of the well water had also dried up, and there was not much water left. Therefore, the masses' emotions were once chaotic. Some said: "The weather is like fire, and there is no hope for the crops." Many people sighed and did not want to work. They said: "It's the same whether you water or not, anyway, you can't harvest grain!" "What can you do without water!" At that time, we were very anxious and worried, and some were shaken and lost confidence in increasing production. At this moment, the Party issued instructions to fight drought and ensure harvest, calling on us to overcome difficulties in every possible way, overcome drought, and strive for a bumper harvest without rain. The Party's instructions gave us great strength. First, we held a meeting to study and unify the thinking of the cadres. Then, the Party committee organized the commune members to launch a big debate on "relying on heaven for food or man will conquer nature" and "whether or not we can overcome drought and win a bumper harvest." Through the debate, the broad masses of commune members strengthened their confidence and actively participated in the drought-fighting struggle. The slogan put forward by the commune members was: "We are determined to overcome the severe drought, divert water for irrigation to protect the farmland, and we are determined to create high yields even if it does not rain." Indeed, everyone's energy was boosted, and they worked hard again.

This period was the most tense. For more than 20 days, the cadres and commune members worked around the clock, sleeping only three or four hours a day. Some did not sleep for several days and nights, and some did not even bother to eat. Many women, the elderly, and children also volunteered to participate in carrying water, lifting water, and pushing water carts. Many commune members "set up camp" in the fields, and their energy was truly soaring. They said: "Working day and night, the hands and feet are worn out but the heart is not willing, ten points of hardship, twenty points of sweetness, fighting hard today for tomorrow." Some commune members, especially young commune members, stayed by the well day and night, drawing water when there was water, and going down the well to dig when there was no water. All the wells in the commune were generally deepened by five or six feet or more within a few days, and some were dug more than ten feet deep, greatly increasing the water volume. At the same time, the commune rushed to dig 120 wells and also dug two river channels, and took measures to make the most of all available surface water and groundwater. Many commune members ran two or three miles to carry water to fight the drought. For all drought-fighting and water-lifting tools, we adopted the method of "resting people but not horses" and rotating shifts day and night, and we rushed to make some new tools. As a result of the joint mobilization of men, women, old and young, and the rush to work hard, the crops were generally watered four or five times, the "fire dragon" was extinguished, and more than 60,000 mu of wheat stubble land were all sown in a timely manner, thereby ensuring a bumper harvest for the whole year.

Everyone is Zhuge Liang, reforming agricultural tools to save labor

Another serious difficulty we encountered in the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production and the vigorous development of industry was the lack of labor. The commune had a total of 14,018 able-bodied and semi-able-bodied laborers, who were almost all engaged in agriculture in the past, and it was still very tight. Last year, the situation changed: on the one hand, in order to ensure a bumper harvest in agriculture, it was necessary to increase measures, and each mu of land needed to increase by an average of 15 to 20 workdays; on the other hand, in order to run industry, support national construction, and build farmland water conservancy projects, it was necessary to draw a large number of laborers. In the autumn of last year, only more than 7,500 laborers were actually engaged in agriculture in the commune. This added great difficulty. What should we do? We thought: we must not bow to difficulties. Therefore, we first summed up the experience of the original Pioneer Advanced Cooperative (now a production team of our commune). This cooperative did a good job in technical revolution, and we prepared to vigorously promote their experience. At this time, the Party at higher levels loudly put forward the call for technical revolution and cultural revolution, which further encouraged and inspired us. According to the Party's instructions, we mobilized all commune members to "use their brains and make inventions," and put forward "exerting effort and drilling hard, thinking boldly, creating boldly, and everyone is Zhuge Liang." Because this slogan was exactly what the masses wanted, everyone quickly took action and came up with many ideas. Over the past year or so, we have created and imitated more than 50 kinds of new tools such as power machines, corn planters, corn planters, close-planting drills, and foot-operated waterwheels. These tools greatly improved labor productivity and reduced labor intensity. For example, the four pulverizers we made ourselves can pulverize 5,000 to 7,000 jin per day, saving 100 to 120 people, and the four machines save 400 to 500 people. We built 250 wind-powered waterwheels, which can also save about 500 people every day. For example, our machine mill can produce 10,000 jin of flour per day, saving more than 140 female laborers and more than 140 livestock, and a sweet potato slicer can also save more than 100 laborers a day. Therefore, many difficulties were solved, and the commune members generally said it was good. In order to do a good job in technical revolution, we established technical research groups in each management area, and cadres and the masses together studied and experimented on major technical issues in production. Now, not only in tool reform, but also in agricultural field management, a group of red and expert technical innovation experts have emerged in our commune. For example, young commune member Zhang Baoji is now able to master the habits of 29 major pests and found prevention and control methods, and also created a double-wheeled powder spreader, which improved work efficiency and insecticidal effect. The masses call it "Insect Control King."

Everyone says the People's Commune is good

In the Great Leap Forward in production, there were also some contradictions that were difficult to resolve. For example, the Great Leap Forward required more and larger-scale farmland capital construction, better planting according to local conditions, and also required more manpower, materials, and financial resources, and required close cooperation in all aspects of industry, agriculture, commerce, education, and military affairs, and agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fishery. However, the original advanced cooperatives were small in scale, and manpower, materials, and financial resources were limited, and many of the above contradictions were difficult to resolve. On this issue, we initially prepared to merge into larger cooperatives, and had already set up the framework. Soon after, we heard Chairman Mao pointed out that "the People's Commune is good." After Chairman Mao's instructions were conveyed to our commune, the broad masses of commune members were very happy and asked to establish a People's Commune. At the request of the broad masses of commune members, our original twenty advanced cooperatives and one fishing cooperative quickly merged. As soon as the People's Commune was established, it first established collective welfare undertakings such as public canteens, nurseries, kindergartens, and sewing groups, liberating women who had been bound by housework for thousands of years. We organized a well-digging professional team of more than 60 people and organized a rushing harvest and planting team. At the same time, we organized a professional team for steel smelting and transportation. In this way, the emotions of the commune members were even higher, and many knots and many contradictions were resolved. Not only did we do a good job in the autumn harvest and industrial production, but we also deeply plowed more than 50,000 mu of wheat fields more than one foot deep and applied an average of 20,000 jin of base fertilizer per mu. Immediately following the establishment of the People's Commune, we implemented a distribution system combining wage system and supply system according to the instructions of the Party at higher levels and the requirements of the masses. Eating without money is something that has never happened before. With this, the lives of the broad masses of commune members were guaranteed, and from then on, they no longer had to worry about food and clothing. Therefore, cadres and commune members were all overjoyed. We compiled a quick board like this: "The People's Commune is paradise, every commune member is happy, production and labor are full of energy, industrial and agricultural production is guaranteed, entering the big canteen for meals, the food is sweet and fragrant, children enter the nursery, growing up lively and happy, the elderly enter the home for the elderly, living a happy life in their old age, where does this happiness come from, thank the benefactor Communist Party."

The above is the main situation of our commune. According to last year's production situation and experience, after discussion by all commune members, we have initially determined: in 1959, the grain yield per mu in agricultural production will reach 1,000 jin, of which wheat is 400 jin, corn is 700 jin, millet is 600 jin, and sweet potatoes are 10,000 jin. It is required that each person has an average of about 1,360 jin of grain. At the same time, we will do a better job in commune and team industry, and comprehensively develop various productions such as animal husbandry, sideline occupations, fishery, and forestry. It is required that the actual income of commune members increase by about 50 percent compared to last year. Now, we are further summing up experience, mobilizing all commune members, continuing to exert full effort, striving for the top, not being arrogant or complacent, and doing a good job in contracting work and production and various production increase measures. We are fully confident of ensuring the realization and overfulfillment of the above plan.

If the above speech is inappropriate, please correct me, fellow representatives.

专栏：

    我们创造了美好生活
    徐建春代表谈山东掖县西由人民公社的大跃进主席、各位代表：
    听了周总理的报告和各位首长的报告，使我受到很大的启发、教育和鼓舞。我完全拥护这些报告，并将在今后工作中坚决贯彻执行。最近，帝国主义和印度扩张主义分子妄想把西藏从祖国大家庭中分裂出去，瞎说什么“西藏独立”，使我非常愤怒。西藏是我国不可分割的一部分，这是谁也改变不了的。他们这种罪恶活动，是蓄意破坏我们祖国的统一和各民族的团结，公开向六亿中国人民挑战。我要警告帝国主义和印度扩张主义分子，中国随便叫人欺负的时候早已经过去了，你们真是有眼不识泰山，硬要拿着鸡蛋碰石头。如果再不停止你们的阴谋诡计，硬要与中国人民为敌，必定要碰得头破血流。
    现在我再把我们山东掖县西由人民公社一九五八年生产大跃进的情况向大会简单汇报一下。
    我们的公社，原来是二十处农业社和一处渔业社，共包括三十五个自然村，一万零一百户，三万九千一百七十人，六万四千亩地。在大跃进的一九五八年中，我们社在上级党的领导下，从春季开始，掀起了一个接着一个的生产高潮，干部、群众白天黑夜，大干、苦干、巧干，一年多来，始终是一股子饱满劲头，因此，生产获得了很大成绩，和一年以前比较，我们那里已经大变样了。在农业方面，虽然遇到了几十年未见的空前严重的干旱，全社粮食生产仍然达到了亩产六百二十一斤，其中后吕生产大队（即原来我们的一个小高级社）亩产平均达到一千三百一十四斤十一两。去年不光农业丰收，我们还按照毛主席的指示，实行了工农业并举，在工业生产方面也取得了很大成绩。我们用土法炼出了一百四十余吨铁，九十六吨钢，办了许多小型工业，其中包括机械厂、化工厂、建筑器材厂、造纸厂、糖果厂、副食品加工厂等，能生产风力水车、脱粒机、电机、木船和各种农具等二百余种产品。全年工业总产值达到六十八万元，比一九五七年增长百分之四十一点八。俺们成立公社以后，还根据群众要求，积极地发展了文教卫生和福利事业，建立了中学一处，半工半读红专学校一处，民办中学三处，半工半读农业中学四处，参加学习的共有一千多人，经过扫盲学习毕业的有四百多人。另有一处中心医院，十处保健站，二处敬老院，十五处幼儿园，八十多处托儿所。这些，都是我们过去根本办不到的事，现在办到了，社员们真是欢欣鼓舞，高兴极了，有的社员这样唱起来：“从前把歌儿唱，无钱无米心头慌，如今真是好时光，丰衣足食心欢畅，活完休息唱起歌，三天不唱喉咙痒。”
    为什么能够取得这么大的成绩呢？社员们都说：多亏毛主席和上级党的领导。
    田间安营扎寨，大战干旱获丰收
    一九五八年入春以来，我们那里就发生了干旱，半年多的时间没有下过一次透雨。在小麦干旱的时候，我们连续浇了几次水，头一关算是闯过去了。那时候还是小高级社，平均亩产小麦达到四百三十斤。可是，麦收以后难办了，干旱越来越重，地面干下一尺多深，犁也犁不动，有些小树干旱了叶，春播作物虽然浇了一些水，还是普遍发黄，有的叶子卷起来了，有的伏倒在地下，夏播作物一部分已经种上的因干旱枯死，大部分眼看就要误时种不上。当时，河水干没了，井水也干了大半，有水也不多了。因此，群众情绪曾一度混乱。有的说：
  “天象下了火似的，庄稼没有希望了”，很多人唉声叹气，不想干活了，他们说：“浇不浇的一个样，反正不能打粮食！”“没有水，有何办法！”当时，我们很着急，很发愁，有的也发生了动摇，对增产失掉了信心。就在这个时候，党发出了抗旱保收的指示，号召我们千方百计克服困难，战胜旱灾，争取无雨保丰收。党的指示给我们以很大的力量，首先开会研究统一了干部思想。接着社党委一面自己亲自动手挖井浇地，以典型事实教育社员，一面组织社员就“靠天吃饭还是人定胜天”、“能不能战胜旱灾，夺取大丰收”等问题展开了大鸣大放大辩论。通过辩论，广大社员都增强了信心，积极投入了抗旱斗争。社员们提出的口号是：“决心战胜天酷旱，引水灌溉保禾田，就是天不下滴雨，也要立志创高产。”的确大家的劲头都鼓起来了又大干苦干起来。
    这一段最紧张，前后有二十多天，干部、社员连夜突击，一天只睡三、四个小时的觉，有的几昼夜不睡觉，有的连饭也顾不得吃。不少妇女、老人、儿童也争先恐后的自动参加挑水、抬水、推水车。很多社员在田间“安营扎寨”，干劲确实冲天，他们说：“披星戴月昼夜干，手脚磨破心不甘，十分苦，二十分甜，今朝奋战为明天”。有些社员，特别是青年社员，日夜守在井旁，有水就提，无水就下井去挖，全社所有的井，几天之内，普遍挖深了五、六尺以上，有的挖下一丈多深，水量大大的增加了。同时，全社突击打机井一百二十眼，还挖了两条河道，对可能利用的地上水、地下水，都采取措施，尽量利用。很多社员跑二、三里路远去挑水抗旱。对所有抗旱提水工具采取了“歇人不歇马”分班昼夜轮战的办法，并赶制了一些新工具。这样男女老少齐动员，突击苦干的结果，一般庄稼都浇了四、五遍水，“火龙”被扑灭了，六万多亩麦茬地，全部适时播了种，从而保证了全年大丰收。
    人人都做诸葛亮，改革农具省劳力
    在农业生产大跃进和大办工业中，我们碰到的另一个严重困难是劳动力不足。全社共男女整半劳动力一万四千零一十八个，过去几乎全部搞农业，还是很紧张的。去年情况发生了变化：一方面为了保证农业的丰收，需要加大措施，每亩地平均需要增加十五个到二十个工日；另一方面为了办工业、支援国家建设和兴修农田水利工程等，又必须抽出大批的劳动力。全社去年秋季实际上搞农业的只有七千五百多个劳力。这就增加了很大困难。如何办呢？我们想：反正不能向困难低头。因此首先总结了原先锋高级社（现在是我们公社的一个生产队）的经验，这个社技术革命搞的好，我们准备大力推广他们的经验。这时，上级党响亮地提出了技术革命和文化革命的号召，这样就更加鼓舞和启发了我们。根据党的指示，我们发动全体社员，“人人动脑筋，个个搞发明”，提出“干劲加钻劲，大胆地想，大胆地创，人人都做诸葛亮”。因为这口号正是群众的要求，所以大家很快行动起来了，想出了很多办法。一年多来，我们创造和仿制了动力机器磨，窝谷播种机、玉米播种机、密植耧、脚踏水车等五十余种新式工具。这些工具大大提高了劳动生产率，减轻了劳动强度。例如，我们自己制造的四部粉碎机，每部每天可粉碎五千至七千斤，节省一百至一百二十人，四部就节省四、五百人。我们造了二百五十部风力水车，每天也可节约五百人左右。再如，我们造的机器磨，每天可出面粉一万斤，节约一百四十多个妇女劳力和一百四十多头牲口，一个地瓜切片机一天也可以节省一百多个劳力。因此，解决了很多困难，社员普遍的说好。为了把技术革命搞好，我们各管理区都建立了技术研究小组，干部和群众一起，围绕着生产上的重大技术问题进行研究和试验。现在我们社里不仅在工具改革方面，而且在农业田间管理方面也已经出现了一批又红又专的技术革新能手。如青年社员张宝吉，现在能够掌握二十九种主要害虫的生活习惯，找到了防治方法，而且还创造了双轮撒粉车，提高了工作效率和杀虫效果，群众称它为“治虫大王”。
    人人都说人民公社好
    在生产大跃进中还有一些矛盾不好解决，譬如，大跃进，需要有更多更大的农田基本建设，需要更好的因地种植，也就需要更多的人力、物力和财力，并要求工农商学兵、农林牧副渔各方面密切配合。而原来的高级社规模小，人力、物力和财力都有限，上述很多矛盾不好解决。对这个问题，开始我们准备并大社，并且已经搭起了架子，不久听到毛主席指出“人民公社好”，毛主席的这一指示传到我们社以后，广大社员都非常高兴，纷纷要求建立人民公社。在广大社员的要求下，我们原来的二十处高级社和一处渔业社，很快的合并起来了。人民公社一成立，首先创办了公共食堂、托儿所、幼儿园、缝纫组等集体福利事业，使几千年来被束缚在家务劳动中的妇女得到了解放。我们组织了六十多人的打井专业队，组织了抢收、抢种大队。同时，组织了炼钢铁、搞运输的专业队。这样社员的情绪更高了，许多疙瘩、许多矛盾都解开了。不但搞好了秋收和工业生产，同时对五万多亩小麦田普遍深翻一尺以上，平均每亩施基肥二万斤。紧接着人民公社的建立，我们根据上级党的指示和群众的要求，实行了工资制与供给制相结合的分配制度，吃饭不要钱，这是开天辟地没有的事，有了这一条，广大社员的生活就有了保证，从此再不用为吃穿发愁了。因此，干部、社员无不欢天喜地。我们编成快板这样唱着：“人民公社是天堂，个个社员喜洋洋，生产劳动干劲足，工农业生产有保障，吃饭走进大食堂，饭菜做得甜又香，小孩入了托儿所，活泼快乐地生长，老人入了敬老院，生活快乐过晚年，这些幸福那里来，感谢恩人共产党。”
    以上是我们公社的主要情况。我们根据去年的生产情况和经验，经过全体社员讨论，初步确定：一九五九年在农业生产上粮食达到亩产一千斤，其中，小麦四百斤，玉米七百斤，谷子六百斤，地瓜一万斤。要求每人平均占有粮食一千三百六十斤左右。同时，更好的办好社、队工业，并全面地发展牧、副、渔、林等各项生产。要求社员实际收入较去年增长百分之五十左右。现在，我们正进一步总结经验，发动全体社员，继续鼓足干劲，力争上游，不骄傲、不自满，搞好包工包产和各项增产措施。我们完全有信心保证上述计划的实现和超额实现。
    以上发言，如有不妥，请各位代表指正。
