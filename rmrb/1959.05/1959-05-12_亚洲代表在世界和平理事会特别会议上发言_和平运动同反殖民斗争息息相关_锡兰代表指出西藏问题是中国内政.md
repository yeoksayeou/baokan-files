Xinhua News Agency, Stockholm, May 10th. The World Peace Council's special session continued its plenary meeting this morning, with thirteen representatives speaking.

Among the seven Asian representatives who spoke today, most discussed the relationship between opposing imperialist war policies and colonial policies and the peace movement. Iraqi representative Sharif, after discussing the Iraqi people's revolutionary struggle, introduced their experience in the peace movement. He pointed out that the Iraqi peace movement is integrated with the national liberation movement. Under the slogan of "Peace and Defending the Republic," they mobilized all the people, united all peace forces, and gained the support of progressive humanity worldwide. He emphasized that the Iraqi people's struggle is also a support for all anti-imperialist and peace-defending struggles.

Ceylon representative Saravanamuttu spoke of the Ceylonese people's friendship with the Chinese people. He pointed out that in Ceylon, a small group of people attempted to use the Tibet issue to wage a cold war against China and support the Tibetan rebellion, but did not succeed. He said that the Ceylonese people and government believe that Tibet is an indivisible part of China, the Tibet issue is China's internal affair, and the Chinese people have consistently adhered to the principles of peaceful coexistence. He asked everyone to be vigilant against the imperialist conspiracy to undermine the unity of the Asian people.

Japanese representative Yoshitaro Hirano proposed abolishing the US-Japan "Security Treaty," withdrawing US troops from Japan, South Korea, South Vietnam, and Taiwan, and establishing a Pacific nuclear-free zone.
