Let the Shanghai Opera Flower Bloom More Vividly
Speech by Committee Member Ding Shi'e

After listening to Premier Zhou's Government Work Report and the reports of the leading comrades, I cannot suppress my heartfelt joy and excitement, and I feel proud of our country's leaping progress and the unprecedented unity of the people.

Under the Party's "Let a hundred flowers bloom" policy, our opera undertaking has presented a thriving and colorful scene. This is unprecedented in Chinese history! Shanghai Opera is a local opera native to Shanghai, and it has greatly developed since liberation. Our Shanghai Opera workers have received the Party's close cultivation, and have made considerable progress in ideology and art. In particular, after rectification, anti-rightist struggles, going up to the mountains and down to the countryside, going deep among the masses, and labor training, our ideological feelings have undergone significant changes. During the Great Leap Forward last year, in order to better integrate with the masses, we implemented the method of "bringing the opera to the doorstep," often performing in factories and rural areas, and received a warm welcome from the broad masses of working people. At the same time, Shanghai Opera, like other brotherly opera genres, performed some good plays that were welcomed by the audience, such as "Soldiers in Their Hometown," "The Angry Tide of Huangpu," and "A Spark of Fire."

However, compared with the magnificent achievements of our country's industry, agriculture, and other fronts, we are still far behind. Art and literature must match our great era, not only in quantity but also in quality. In order to improve quality and better serve the working people, we must make arduous efforts, affirm our achievements, overcome our shortcomings, and continue to move forward.

Actors Must Understand Characters with Correct Viewpoints

Art and literature are ideological weapons that serve politics. The purpose of improving quality is to enable this weapon to better exert its role. Therefore, I believe that improving quality first requires creators to go deep into the lives of the masses and improve their political ideology, whether they are authors, actors, directors, composers, or other stage workers. Take actors, for example, how to create vivid heroic images on the stage, express the noble qualities of ordinary working people, and truly touch the hearts of the audience, requires not only superb acting skills, but also a love for heroes and working people, and a genuine and profound understanding of them. Last year, our troupe performed "Competing to go to the Thirteen Tombs," which is a story about a mother-in-law and daughter-in-law competing to volunteer at the Thirteen Tombs Reservoir construction site. I played the role of the daughter-in-law, but I couldn't rehearse it well. My comrades' opinion of me was that I didn't have the spirit of the new Chinese women that "no force can stop." I tried to make up for it through acting skills, trying to make my movements rougher and my demeanor more high-spirited, but it didn't work, because this was not purely a matter of appearance and physical movements, but a matter of temperament. Once, when I performed "Women's Representative" in the countryside, this play featured Zhang Gui'rong, an advanced rural woman. After watching it, she frankly criticized me, saying, "You don't act like a working woman! In the countryside, who would elect you as a representative when you can't even carry a bucket of water properly!" (Because there is a water-carrying action in the play.) This sentence really hit my weakness. Later, after actual labor training, I had a different understanding when I performed these plays again. Last year, we performed "An Actor's Diary," which is a play about the anti-rightist struggle in the opera world. I played the role of a left-wing actress, Cheng Zhihua. In one scene, Cheng Zhihua denounces the crimes of the rightists in a long singing passage. At first, when I performed this passage, the emotional component was mostly sadness, because the rightist she was denouncing was someone she had once loved. At that time, I used petty-bourgeois ideological feelings to perform this passage. Although I also thought about the hateful nature of the rightists, I focused too much on the personal gains and losses of hating myself for loving the wrong person, which weakened the class struggle of life and death between the rightists' rampant attack on the Party, so this left-winger seemed weak and powerless, lacking the due worker's class emotion of hating evil like an enemy. With the help of the leaders and comrades, I corrected these incorrect understandings and underwent a transformation of ideological feelings. Later, when singing this passage, it appeared more powerful. It is the same when portraying ancient characters, whether they are positive or negative, actors cannot perform well if they do not understand the characters with the correct viewpoints. From this, we can see that for an artistic work that highly combines ideology and artistry, first of all, creators must have high political cultivation and the feelings of the working people.

Screenwriters, Directors, Actors, Composers, and Musicians Must Cooperate Closely

Opera is a comprehensive art, therefore, strengthening cooperation in all aspects is also a very important issue for improving quality. For example, the cooperation between writers, directors, and actors. Actors should respect the labor of the authors; authors and directors should also pay attention to the characteristics of the actors. Authors and directors must also understand each other's hardships and explore art with a comrade-like attitude of mutual care, to improve the quality of the repertoire. The "Mother" created by our troupe can serve as a good example to prove the importance of strengthening cooperation. Before the rectification, when the first draft of "Mother" was completed, because the writers, directors, and actors were not united, the actors kept picking on the shortcomings of the script, and the script was almost rejected. The writers and directors lost confidence and did not carefully analyze which of the actors' opinions were correct and which were not. The play was rashly discarded after rehearsal, neither performed nor revised. After the rectification, everyone felt that this was not right. The writers, directors, and actors joined hands again, sincerely discussed their opinions, and the actors also helped to come up with ideas. After the script was revised, the play was brought to the stage and finally received unanimous praise from the audience, and it has now become a relatively excellent repertoire in our troupe. Music reform is also the same, requiring close cooperation between composers, actors, and musicians. In the past, in our work of music reform, we had two situations due to poor cooperation. One was that the composer created completely, and the actors sang whatever was written, regardless of whether it was good or bad; the other was that the actors sang their own tunes, and the composer transcribed the actors' singing, and the experienced musicians just accompanied accordingly. The result of this separate creation was: either a hard improvement that deviated from the original foundation, making it unacceptable to the audience, or sticking to conventions without development, thus failing to satisfy the audience. Conversely, if the composer, actors, and musicians cooperate well, then wonderful creations will appear. We have a tune called "Cross Tune," which was not originally in the tradition. Later, a musician created this tune. It was not very good at first. After the actors' practice, and revised and supplemented together with the composer, this tune was enriched, and it has now become a commonly used and popular tune with our audience. The above are just two examples. In our actual work, we deeply realize that if all aspects cooperate well, the potential for artistic creation will be infinite. Mastering Advanced Techniques to Express Highly Ideological Content

Improving quality also requires mastering techniques. This point has great practical significance for the specific situation of our Shanghai Opera genre. Ultimately, opera art can only express highly ideological content well, infect the audience, and meet the audience's increasing demands if it masters advanced techniques. Shanghai Opera has its own traditions and style: it has a strong atmosphere of life and reflects reality quickly, but compared with other opera genres, it has a short history and a thin foundation, so it is urgent to learn the expressive techniques of traditional opera art. We must humbly learn from other opera genres, absorb their strengths as nutrients, and continuously improve and enrich ourselves while maintaining the inherent characteristics of Shanghai Opera.

Of course, improving quality should also carry out artistic discussions and free competitions in different forms and styles, both within our opera genre and among various brotherly opera genres. This kind of discussion and competition is indispensable. We firmly believe that under the guidance of the Party's "Let a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend" policy, in an art garden full of sunshine, rain, and warmth, our Shanghai Opera flower will surely compete with the splendid and dazzling hundred flowers, and bloom with unique brilliance!

Indian Interventionists Quickly Put Away Your Ambitions

Finally, I want to express some opinions on the situation in Tibet. The heinous treasonous acts of a small handful of reactionary elements in the upper strata of Tibet have suffered a shameful defeat. The People's Liberation Army, ordered to suppress the Tibetan traitorous group, with the full support and cooperation of the Tibetan people, will soon be able to completely eliminate the bandits. This shows the unprecedented strength of our motherland and the unprecedented close unity of our various ethnic groups! We are very angry that some people in our friendly neighboring country of India have expressed open and blatant so-called "sympathy" for the Tibetan rebels (the correct interpretation is: instigation, support, and encouragement of rebellion). Indian expansionists even shouted "Tibetan independence" in the same tone as British imperialism. We cannot but believe that this behavior is extremely arrogant and the motivation is extremely sinister. We express our firm protest! We solemnly warn the Indian expansionists: quickly rein in your horse on the edge of the cliff, and put away your ambitions and conspiracies! We will always extend the hand of friendship to India, but we must resolutely counter any provocation. The era when the Chinese people were manipulated and played with is over forever!

    让沪剧这朵花开得更鲜艳
    丁是娥委员的发言
    听了周总理的政府工作报告和各位首长的报告，抑止不住衷心的欣喜和激动，并为我们祖国飞跃的进步，人民空前的团结感到自豪。
    我国戏曲事业在党的“百花齐放”的方针下，出现了欣欣向荣、万紫千红的局面。这是中国历史上从来没有的！沪剧是上海土生土长的地方戏，解放以来，有了很大的发展。我们沪剧工作者，受到党的亲切的培养，在思想上、艺术上也都有了长足的进步。特别是通过整风、反右、上山下乡、深入群众、劳动锻炼以后，思想感情起了显著的变化。在去年大跃进中，我们为了更好地和群众结合，实行“把戏送上门去”的办法，经常到工厂、农村演出，受到广大劳动人民的热烈欢迎。同时，沪剧和其他兄弟剧种一样，演出了像“战士在故乡”“黄浦怒潮”“星星之火”等一些受到观众欢迎的好戏。
    但是和我们国家工农业和其它各个战线上的宏伟成就相比，还是远远落在后面，文艺要和我们这个伟大的时代相称，不但要量多，而且要质高。为了提高质量，更好地为劳动人民服务，我们还必须作出艰苦的努力，肯定成绩，克服缺点，继续前进。
    演员要用正确观点理解人物
    文艺是为政治服务的思想武器，提高质量的目的就是为了使这个武器更好地发挥它的作用。因此，我认为，提高质量首先是创作人员深入群众生活，提高政治思想，无论是作者、演员、导演、作曲者及其他舞台工作者都是一样。拿演员来说，怎样在舞台上创造鲜明的英雄形象，表现普通劳动人民的高贵气质，使我们真正能够打动观众的心弦，就不但需要精湛的演技，尤其需要对英雄人物和劳动人民的热爱，对他们真正的深刻的理解。去年我们剧团演出“争上十三陵”，这是个描写婆媳二人争着上十三陵水库工地义务劳动的故事，我担任剧中媳妇一角，在排练中怎么也排不好，同志们对我的意见是没有新中国妇女那种“什么力量也阻挡不住”的气概。我企图通过演技来补救，尽量使动作粗犷些，神态昂扬些，但没有用，因为这不是纯粹外型和形体动作问题，而是个气质问题。还有一次，我在农村里演出“妇女代表”，这个戏里的代表张桂容，一个先进的农村妇女，看完后对我坦率地提出批评说：“你演的不像个劳动妇女！在农村中，象你这样连桶水都提不像的，谁还选你当代表呀！”
  （因为戏里有提水的动作）这真是一句话就说中了我的弱点。后来经过了实际劳动锻炼，再演这些戏，体会就不同了。我们去年演出的“演员日记”，那是个描写戏曲界反右斗争的戏，我演的是一个左派的演员程芷华，其中有一段程芷华向大家控诉右派罪状的大段唱功，起先我演这一段时，感情是悲哀的成份多，因为她控诉的那个右派分子，是她自己曾经爱过的。我当时以小资产阶级的思想感情来演这一段，虽然也想到右派的可恨，但是过多地从恨自己错爱了人的个人得失出发，削弱了右派向党猖狂进攻是你死我活的阶级斗争，所以这个左派显得软弱无力，缺乏应有的嫉恶如仇的工人阶级感情。经过领导和同志们的帮助，我才纠正了这些不正确的理解，来了个思想感情的转变，以后，演唱这段戏时就显得有力了。表现古代人物也是这样，不管是正面的或是反面的，演员如果不以正确的观点来理解人物，同样也是演不好的。由此可见，一个思想性和艺术性高度结合的艺术作品，首先，创作人员必须具备高度的政治修养和劳动人民的感情。
    编剧、导演、演员、作曲、乐师等要密切协作
    戏曲是个综合性的艺术，因此，加强各方面的协作，对提高质量也是个很重要的问题。如编、导、演之间的合作，演员应该尊重作者的劳动；作者、导演也应该注意演员的特点。作者和导演也必需要互相体谅甘苦，以同志般互相关心的态度进行艺术探讨，以提高剧目的质量。我们剧团所创作的“母亲”，可以作为一个很好的例子，证明加强协作的重要性。在整风以前，“母亲”初稿完成的时候，由于编、导、演三者没团结好，演员尽挑剧本的缺点，剧本几乎给否定了，编导失去了信心，没有仔细分析演员的意见哪些是正确的，哪些是不对的，戏排了以后就轻率地丢掉了，既不上演，也不修改。整风以后，大家感觉到这样是不对的，编、导、演重新携起手来，推心置腹地谈意见，演员也一起帮着想点子。剧本经过修改，戏搬上舞台，终于得到了观众一致的好评，现在已成为我们团里比较优秀的剧目。音乐改革也是这样，需要作曲、演员、乐师之间亲密无间的合作。我们过去在音乐改革工作中，曾经因为合作得不好，出现了两种情况，一种是完全由作曲者去创造，演员不管好坏照着唱；一种是演员唱自己的曲子，作曲照着演员的唱腔记记谱，有丰富经验的乐师也不过就照着伴奏，这种各自为政的创作的结果是：不是离开原有基础硬提高，使观众不能接受，便是墨守成规没有发展，因而使观众不能满足。相反地，如果作曲、演员、乐师合作得好，那就会出现精彩的创作，我们有一个曲调叫“十字调”，原来传统中没有这个曲调，后来有一位乐师创作了这个调子，开始时并不很好听，经过演员的实践，和作曲一起修改补充，丰富了这个曲调，现在已经成为我们常用和受观众欢迎的调子了。上面所举的，不过是两个例子。我们在实际工作中，深深体会到：如果各方面协作得好，艺术创造的潜力将是无穷的。掌握高度的技巧才能表现高度的思想性
    提高质量还须要掌握技术，这一点，对我们沪剧这一剧种的具体情况来说，更具有极大的现实意义。归根到底，戏曲艺术只有掌握了高度的技巧，才得很好地表现高度的思想性，去感染观众，适应观众日益提高的要求。沪剧有自己的传统和风格：它生活气息浓，反映现实快，但比起其他剧种来，历史短，家底薄，因此迫切需要学习传统的戏曲艺术的表现技巧。我们要虚心地向其他剧种学习，吸收其长处以作养料，在保持沪剧固有特点的条件下，不断地提高自己，丰富自己。
    当然，提高质量还应该开展艺术探讨和不同形式、不同风格的自由竞赛，在本剧种之间，在各种不同的兄弟剧种之间，这种探讨和竞赛，都是不可缺的。我们深信，在党的“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针指导下，在充满阳光雨露、风和日暖的艺术园地里，我们沪剧这一朵花，一定能和灿烂夺目的百花争艳，放出异彩来！
    印度干涉者赶快收起野心来
    最后，我要对西藏局势发表一点意见。西藏一小撮上层反动分子罪大恶极的叛国行为，已经遭到可耻的失败，奉命讨伐西藏叛国集团的人民解放军，在西藏人民充分支持和合作之下，不久就可以把叛匪彻底肃清。这说明了我们祖国的空前强大，我们各族人民空前的团结无间！我们感到非常愤怒的是，我们友好的邻邦印度的一些人士，竟对西藏叛乱分子表示公开露骨的所谓“同情”（正确的解释是：挑唆、支持、鼓励叛乱），印度扩张主义分子，甚至高呼和英帝国主义同一口吻的“西藏独立”，我们不能不认为，这种行为是极端狂妄的，动机是极端险恶的。我们表示坚决的抗议！我们严正地警告印度的扩张主义分子：赶快悬崖勒马，把你们的野心和阴谋收起来吧！我们永远向印度伸出友谊之手，可是对于任何的挑衅，我们一定要坚决地反击。中国人民受人摆布和戏弄的时代，永远过去了！
