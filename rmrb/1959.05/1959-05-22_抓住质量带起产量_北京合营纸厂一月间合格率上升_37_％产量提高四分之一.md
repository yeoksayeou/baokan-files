    Grasp Quality to Boost Production
    Beijing Joint Paper Mill's Qualification Rate Rises 37% and Output Increases by a Quarter in One Month

    (Our report) In the movement to increase production and practice economy, the Beijing Joint Paper Mill achieved a double leap in quality and quantity, and also saved a considerable amount of raw materials. The qualification rate of paper rapidly increased from an average of 38.19% in March to 75.65% in April. The whole month of April also saved more than 80,000 kilograms of raw materials, and the output increased by a quarter compared with March.

    In the past, the quality of paper produced by this factory was very poor, with many pinholes, dust spots, and creases, and high moisture content, which was very unwelcome to users. After the launch of the production increase and economy practice movement centered on high quality and high output in the city, the workers also wanted to take active action. Leading cadres and technicians also went deep into workshops and groups to find the causes and check for loopholes together with the workers. They found many problems, such as the fact that paper pulp used to be screened by a screening machine, but later, as production increased, the screen openings became smaller, and the paper pulp could not pass through. Some workers, in order to save trouble, reduced the amount of pulp screened, and 80% of the pulp was not screened. Paper made in this way would naturally have many pinholes and dust spots. Another example is that because there were few washing machines, the soil and sand in the paper pulp were not washed clean, and the moisture content was high, so the paper produced was very unsuitable for use.

    After discussion and inspection, everyone realized that the low quality was not only due to the inferior raw materials, but the main reason was that they themselves did not pay enough attention to it, and did not discover problems in time or take measures to solve them. Then, the factory held a skills competition, and each workshop and group put forward their own guarantee conditions and specific measures. A vigorous high-quality, high-yield movement unfolded.

    The workers wanted to enlarge the screen openings of the screening machine, but how to do it? In the past, these screen openings were all made with machine tools in larger machine factories. But now everyone is very busy, and no one knows how many months it will take for them to have time. Leading cadres, workers, and technicians studied together and decided to do it themselves. They pieced together a local milling machine and enlarged the screen openings with almost no effort. With this change, the paper pulp was much finer and more uniform than before. The workers in Liu Jinxiao's group were also pondering all day long: Why are there so many creases on the paper? They found that the paper dried quickly in the middle on the drying cylinder, and slowly on both sides, so creases formed. They discussed with leading cadres and technicians, and thought that if two leather water pipes were added next to the wire case to flush the edges of the paper with water, and the edges of the paper were thinner, wouldn't they dry faster? This problem, which had always been thought to be unsolvable, was solved all at once.

    抓住质量带起产量
    北京合营纸厂一月间合格率上升37％产量提高四分之一
    本报讯　北京合营造纸厂在增产节约运动中，质量产量双跃进，并且节约了不少原料。纸的合格率由3月平均的38.19％迅速提高到4月的75.65％，4月全月还节约原料八万多公斤，产量也比3月份提高四分之一。
    过去这个厂生产的纸质量很坏，纸上沙眼、尘埃窟窿、折纹多，水分大，用户很不欢迎。以高质、高产为中心的增产节约运动在全市开展以后，工人们也想积极行动起来。领导干部和技术人员也分别深入车间、小组，和工人一起找原因，查漏洞。他们发现许多问题，例如纸浆过去都经过筛浆机筛，后来产量多了，筛口小了，纸浆筛不过去，有些工人图省事，减少过筛浆量，80％的纸浆不经过筛，这样做出来的纸，沙眼、窟窿当然多。又如，因为洗涤机少，纸浆里的土、沙洗不净，水分大，做出来的纸就很不适合使用。
    经过讨论、检查，大家认识到：质量低，不单单是因为原料次，最主要的原因是自己思想上不够重视，没有及时发现问题，及时采取措施解决。接着全厂召开了比武大会，各车间和小组都提出自己的保证条件和具体措施。一个轰轰烈烈的高质、高产运动展开了。
    工人们想把筛浆机的筛口加大，可是怎么做呢？过去这些筛口都是到较大的机器厂用机床作的。可是现在大家都忙得很，不知要等几个月人家才有空。领导干部、工人和技术人员就在一起研究，决定自己动手干。他们七拼八凑作出一个土铣床，几乎没费什么劲就把筛口加大了。这一改，纸浆比以前细匀多了。刘金孝小组的工人也整天在琢磨：为什么纸上的折纹那么多？他们发现纸在烘缸上，中间干得快，两边干得慢，所以形成折纹。他们和领导干部及技术人员商量，要是在网槽旁边加两个皮水管子，用水冲纸边，纸边薄了，不就干得快了吗？这个过去一直认为解决不了的问题，就这样一下解决了。
