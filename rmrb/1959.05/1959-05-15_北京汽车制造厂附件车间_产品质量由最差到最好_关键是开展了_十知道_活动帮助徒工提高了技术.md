Beijing Automotive Manufacturing Plant's Accessory Workshop
Product Quality Improves from Worst to Best
Key is the "Ten Knowledges" Campaign to Help Apprentices Improve Skills

    (Our dispatch) Beijing — The Accessory Workshop of the Beijing Automotive Manufacturing Plant launched a "Ten Knowledges" campaign among apprentices, vigorously helping them improve their technical skills. In the past two months, while completing production plans, the workshop has seen its scrap rate decrease month by month, winning the red flag for first place in the factory's quality competition.

    Before March, the Accessory Workshop was the worst in terms of quality at the Beijing Automotive Manufacturing Plant. A portion of the veteran workers in the workshop were sent to support the construction of new factories, leaving behind a workforce that was 80% apprentices. Due to the urgent needs of production, these apprentices began working shifts without systematically learning basic operational knowledge. Therefore, in the production process, poor product quality often resulted.

    In order to change this situation, the workshop's Party branch, on the one hand, called on apprentices to improve product quality, practice strict economy, and reduce costs. On the other hand, they decided to launch the "Ten Knowledges" campaign to help apprentices improve their technical skills and ensure product quality. The content of the "Ten Knowledges" campaign is as follows: 1. Know the name of the part being processed; 2. Know the use of the part being processed; 3. Know the dimensions of the part being processed; 4. Know the quality requirements of the part being processed; 5. Know the time quota required for processing the part; 6. Know what tools should be used to process the part; 7. Know the correct processing method; 8. Know the reasonable processing steps; 9. Know the performance of the equipment being used; 10. Know the price of the part being processed.

    After the "Ten Knowledges" campaign was launched, it sparked a wave of enthusiasm among the apprentices for learning operational techniques and improving quality. At present, the vast majority of the more than 770 apprentices already know the processing steps and basic knowledge of a part. In order to deepen the campaign, the workshop's Youth League branch also organized a quality experience dissemination team, composed of assembly workers, veteran workers, quality inspectors, and outstanding apprentices. A quality competition was also organized, creating an atmosphere where everyone cares about product quality.

    The workshop's scrap rate is stipulated to be no more than 0.45%. After launching the "Ten Knowledges" campaign among the apprentices, the scrap rate in April has dropped to 0.15%, and the production task was overfulfilled by 8%.

    北京汽车制造厂附件车间
    产品质量由最差到最好
    关键是开展了“十知道”活动帮助徒工提高了技术
    本报讯　北京汽车制造厂附件车间在徒工中开展“十知道”活动，大力帮助徒工提高技术水平，两个月来，这个车间在完成生产计划的同时，废品率月月下降，获得全厂质量第一的红旗。
    附件车间在3月份以前，是北京汽车制造厂质量最差的一个车间。车间里的一部分老工人去支援新厂建设，留下的生产工人中有十分之八是徒工。由于生产上的迫切需要，这些徒工没有系统地学习基本操作知识，就开始顶班生产。因此，在生产过程中，常常造成产品质量低劣的现象。
    为了改变这个情况，车间党支部一面向徒工提出了提高产品质量、厉行节约、降低成本的号召，一面决定开展“十知道”活动，来帮助徒工提高技术水平，保证产品质量。“十知道”活动的内容是：一、知道所加工零件的名称；二、知道所加工零件的用处；三、知道所加工零件的尺寸；四、知道所加工零件的质量要求；五、知道加工零件所需的工时定额；六、知道加工零件该用什么工具；七、知道加工的正确方法；八、知道加工的合理步骤；九、知道所使用的设备的性能；十、知道加工零件的价格。
    “十知道”活动展开后，在徒工中掀起了一个学习操作技术、提高质量的热潮。目前，七百七十多个徒工，绝大部分都已知道一个零件的加工过程和基本知识。车间的团支部为了深入展开这项活动，还组织一个优质经验传播队，由装配工人、老工人、质量检查员和优秀徒工组成。又组织了优质竞赛，形成了人人关心产品质量的风气。
    这个车间的废品率规定不得超过0.45％，在徒工中开展“十知道”活动后，4月份废品率已下降到0.15％，并超额8％完成生产任务。
