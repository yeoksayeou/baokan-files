     Quick Harvest, Quick Threshing, Quick Purchase, Quick Transport
    The summer harvest has already begun in the southern provinces, and the large-scale summer harvest in the northern provinces is also fast approaching. Because the people's communes in various regions have implemented the "Eight-Character Charter" for agricultural production, this year's summer harvest crops are growing well, and the yield per unit area has increased compared to last year. With the arrival of the summer harvest, the requisition and transfer of summer grain and rapeseed will also begin rapidly. In order to implement the instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council on doing a good job in the summer grain and oil requisition work in a timely manner, the summer grain-producing areas have generally started preparing for requisition earlier this year than last year. At present, most regions have already held provincial-level meetings to arrange for the requisition of summer grain and oil, and are conveying the spirit of the central instructions level by level, and deploying requisition tasks level by level. Henan, Sichuan, Anhui, Hubei, Jiangsu and other provinces, which are progressing faster, have already assigned the requisition tasks to the production teams of the people's communes. The business departments in many regions have also prepared sufficient purchase equipment and granaries, sufficient purchase funds and transportation tools, and some have also set up grain delivery reception stations to welcome the first batch of new grain sold by the people's communes.
    This year is the first summer harvest after the establishment of the people's communes. Thanks to the great achievements in consolidating the people's communes, judging from some areas with earlier harvests, the enthusiasm of the production teams of the people's communes for selling summer grain and oil is very high. For example, Jinxian County in Jiangxi Province has now completed 92% of its oil sales task. The Meizhuang and Sanli communes in this county exceeded their oil sales task in just three days. Those people's communes that are about to begin harvesting are also preparing to sell good grain to the state immediately according to plan after the summer grain comes on the market. These situations all show that a nationwide high tide of summer grain and oil purchase is coming.
    To complete this year's summer grain requisition task, we must resolutely implement the principle of quick harvesting, quick threshing, quick requisition, and quick transport instructed by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council. To achieve this "four quicks" principle, we must resolutely achieve simultaneous harvesting, threshing, purchasing, and transporting, and closely combine the four links of harvesting, threshing, purchasing, and transporting, instead of waiting until all the summer grain and rapeseed are harvested before purchasing and transferring. At the same time, we must also take into account summer harvest, summer purchase, and summer planting, and make comprehensive arrangements. In this way, our overall requirement should be five goods: good harvest, good requisition, good distribution, good use, and good summer planting. As everyone knows, summer farming is particularly busy, the maturity period of summer harvest crops is very short, and there are many natural disasters. If we don't seize the time, we may cause losses in any link of summer harvest, summer purchase, and summer planting; and in order to do a good job in summer purchase and summer planting, and also do a good job in autumn grain field management and ensure that rations are connected to the new autumn grain, we must require the people's communes to use grain well, to plan consumption, and to use it sparingly. Therefore, all localities should seize the time to harvest quickly, thresh quickly, requisition quickly, and transport quickly. Launch a movement of "four simultaneous," "four quicks," and "five goods."
    The sooner the people's communes sell summer grain and oil to the state, the sooner they can get money in return. In this way, not only can the commune members receive their wages earlier and use them for seasonal changes and purchase necessary daily necessities; but also the communes and production teams can purchase various means of production as soon as possible and prepare for the autumn harvest earlier. Therefore, buying quickly is first and foremost beneficial to the people's communes and commune members. Secondly, buying quickly is also conducive to adjusting the varieties of grain eaten by the people in cities and industrial and mining areas, and can support the needs of the people in some grain-deficient areas. This is also the responsibility that farmers in summer grain-producing areas should fulfill to national construction and the people of the whole country.
    Simultaneous purchase and quick purchase must also be accompanied by simultaneous transport and quick transport. As everyone knows, the later the grain and oil transfer is pushed, the closer it is to autumn and winter, and the more strained the transportation capacity becomes. If we do not seize the opportunity now and transfer it in time, delaying it will encounter difficulties in transportation and affect the failure to complete the transfer task well.
    How can we achieve quick harvesting, quick threshing, quick purchasing, and quick transporting? Here, the most important thing is to closely link the various links of harvesting, requisition, and transportation, and to carry out all tasks continuously while harvesting, threshing, purchasing, and transporting. To this end, the leading cadres of the people's communes and production teams need to make good arrangements for the labor force engaged in harvesting, threshing, transportation, summer cultivation, and summer planting. In transportation, it is necessary to ensure that the "grain commander" is unimpeded. In this way, we can complete the entire purchase and transfer task from beginning to end in the shortest possible time. Conversely, if we wait until all the summer grain is harvested before requisitioning, it will not only be unfavorable for the rapid completion of the requisition task, unfavorable for the people's communes to purchase means of production in a timely manner, and unfavorable for commune members to arrange their lives, but also particularly unfavorable for summer cultivation and summer planting. Whether autumn fields can be cultivated and planted in time has a great impact on the abundance of the autumn harvest. If all the work of harvesting, purchasing, and transporting is done at once, the farmers can free up their hands to concentrate on summer cultivation and summer planting. If it is dragged out until after the harvest to transfer, it is necessary to re-arrange the labor force, move the grain stored in the commune's warehouse out again, and transport it to the state warehouse or along the transportation line, which not only wastes labor force, distracts the production team's energy from managing large fields, but also increases the chance of scattering and waste.
    In order to be quick, we must pay close attention to the quality of work in every link. First of all, we must do a good job in harvesting. We must harvest and thresh carefully to ensure that every grain returns home. If the work of harvesting and threshing is done roughly, and the grain that has already been obtained is scattered in vain, it will be unfavorable to both the state and the farmers.
    To purchase quickly, so that the vast number of farmers consciously and enthusiastically sell grain, we must purchase well. And to purchase well, the key lies in retaining well. That is, according to the "three fixes" policy, retain seeds, rations, and feed for each production team. Do not retain too much and affect the state's prescribed sales task; nor should you retain too little and affect the farmers' living and production needs. This year's arrangement of the state's summer grain requisition task was determined after carefully considering all aspects. In order to take care of the needs of the people's communes and commune members, the state has appropriately increased the proportion of grain retained by the people's communes on the basis of this year's summer grain increase. This is undoubtedly very beneficial for the people's communes to do a good job in distribution. However, on the other hand, the people's communes and production teams must also adhere to the principle of thrift, use water sparingly, and arrange grain consumption in a planned way. In this way, we can ensure that the summer grain sales task is completed, and will not reduce the level of grain eating and using of the communes and commune members.
    The grain, commerce, finance and trade departments have a very heavy task of completing the requisition of summer grain and oil in a short period of time and ensuring that they are put into storage on time. In addition to doing a good job in all aspects of purchase preparation, these departments should also appropriately increase the number of purchase points in accordance with the principle of facilitating mass sales, in order to save the time of the masses. When entering the warehouse, it is necessary to conscientiously do a good job in inspecting grain quality, organizing transportation, weighing and entering the warehouse, and settling accounts and making payments, and earnestly achieve paying for grain on the spot, ensuring that the grain quality meets the standards, and that the accounts are clear.
    The summer grain requisition work is an extremely important central task at present. Party committees at all levels must firmly grasp this work to ensure that no link in the requisition work is squeezed out by other work; and, for a certain period of time, the requisition work should be placed in the most important position. The large-scale requisition work is about to begin. It is hoped that all localities will seize the opportunity, mobilize the masses, summon up their energy, and strive to comprehensively and victoriously complete the requisition task of summer grain and oil.

     快收快打快购快运
    夏收在南方各省已经开始，北方各省大规模的夏收也快到来了。由于各地人民公社贯彻了农业生产的“八字宪法”，今年夏收作物生长良好，单位面积产量比去年有所提高。随着夏收的到来，夏粮和油菜籽的征购调运工作也将迅速展开。为了贯彻执行中共中央、国务院关于及时做好夏季粮食油料征购工作的指示，今年各个夏粮产区的征购准备工作普遍比去年动手得早。现在，大部分地区都已经开过了省一级的布置夏粮和油料征购工作的会议，并且正在逐级传达中央指示的精神，逐级布置征购任务。进度较快的河南、四川、安徽、湖北、江苏等省，已经把征购任务落实到人民公社的生产队。许多地区的业务部门也已经准备了足够的收购器材和粮仓，准备了足够的收购资金和运输工具，有的还设立了送粮招待站，准备迎接人民公社交售的第一批新粮。
    今年是人民公社成立后第一个夏收，由于整顿人民公社的工作取得了巨大成绩，从一部分收获较早的地区来看，人民公社各生产队出售夏粮和油料的积极性十分高涨。如江西进贤县现在已经完成了油料交售任务的92％。这个县的枚庄、三里两个公社，只用了三天时间就超额完成了油料的交售任务。那些即将开镰收割的人民公社，也都准备在夏粮登场以后，立即按照计划把好粮卖给国家。这些情况都显示着，一个全国范围的夏粮和油料收购高潮正在到来。
    完成今年的夏粮征购任务，必须坚决执行中共中央和国务院指示的快收、快打、快征购、快运送的方针。而要实现这个“四快”的方针，必须坚决做到边收、边打、边购、边运，把收、打、购、运四个环节紧密地结合起来，而不要等到夏季粮食和油菜籽全部收获起来以后再收购调运。同时还要做到夏收、夏购、夏种统筹兼顾、全面安排。这样，我们的总的要求就应该是五好：收获好，征购好，分配好，使用好，夏种好。大家知道，夏季农事特别繁忙，夏收作物的成熟期很短，而且自然灾害较多，稍不抓紧，时机一失，就可能在夏收、夏购、夏种中的任何一个环节造成损失；而为了搞好夏购、夏种，并且很好地搞好秋粮田间管理和使口粮接上新秋粮，就必须要求人民公社把粮食使用好，要计划消费、细水长流。因此，各地应当抓紧时机快收快打快征购快运送。开展一个“四边”“四快”“五好”的运动。
    人民公社早一天把夏粮和油料交售给国家，就可以早一天换回货币。这样，不仅社员们可以早些领到工资，用来换季和购买必要的生活用品；而且各个公社和生产队也可以及早购买各种生产资料，早一些为秋季丰收做好准备。因此，购得快，首先对人民公社和社员是有利的。其次，购得快，还有利于给城市和工矿区人民调剂吃粮的品种，可以支援部分缺粮地区人民的需要，这也是夏粮产区的农民对国家建设和全国人民应尽的责任。
    边购、快购，还要边运、快运。大家知道，粮油调运越往后推，越是临近秋冬，运输力越是紧张。如果现在不抓紧时机，及时调运，拖延下去，就会在运输上遇到困难，影响调运任务不能很好的完成。
    怎样才能做到收得快、打得快、购得快、运得快呢？这里，最主要的就是要把收获、征购和运输各个环节紧密地衔接起来，一边收、一边打、一边购、一边运，使各项工作连续不断地进行。为此，各个人民公社和生产队的领导干部，需要把从事收获、打场、运输和夏耕、夏种的劳动力作很好的安排。在运输中，要保证“粮帅”畅通无阻。这样，我们就能在最短的时间内从头到尾完成全部的收购调运任务。与此相反，如果等到夏粮全部收割完了再征购，不仅不利于征购任务的迅速完成，不利于人民公社及时购买生产资料，不利于社员安排生活，而且尤其不利于夏耕夏种。秋田能否及时耕好种好，对秋收的丰歉有绝大的影响。如果把收、购、运等全部工作一次做完，农民就可以腾出手来集中力量进行夏耕夏种。如果拖到收完之后再来调运，就要重新安排劳动力，把装进公社仓库的粮食又搬出来，运到国家仓库或交通沿线，不仅浪费劳动力，分散生产队经营大田的精力，而且增加了抛撒浪费的机会。
    为了做到快，必须在每一个环节中切实注意工作的质量。首先要做好收获工作。一定要细收细打，做到颗粒还家。如果收割、打场的工作做得粗糙，使已经到手的粮食白白抛撒掉，这对国家对农民都是不利的。
    要收购得快，使广大农民自觉地踊跃地交售粮食，就必须收购得好。而要收购得好，关键又在于要留得好。即根据“三定”政策，给各个生产队留好种籽、口粮和饲料。既不要多留而影响国家规定的交售任务；也不要少留而影响农民的生活和生产的需要。今年国家对夏粮征购任务的布置，是周密地考虑了各方面的情况之后确定的。为了照顾人民公社和社员的需要，国家在今年夏粮增产的基础上，已经适当地增加了人民公社留粮部分的比例。这对于人民公社做好分配工作无疑是十分有利的。但是，另一方面，人民公社和生产队也要本着节约的原则，细水长流，有计划地安排粮食消费。这样，就可以作到既保证完成夏粮交售任务，又不会降低公社和社员吃粮、用粮的水平。
    粮食、商业、财贸等部门要在短时间内完成夏粮和油料的征购工作，保证按时入库，任务是很繁重的。这些部门除了要做好各项收购准备工作之外，还应当本着便利群众交售的原则，适当地增设收购点，以节省群众的时间。在入仓时，要认真地做好检验粮质、组织运送、过秤入仓、结账付款等工作，切实做到一手交粮一手付款，粮质合乎标准，账款一清二楚。
    夏粮征购工作是当前一项极其重要的中心工作。各级党委必须紧紧抓住这项工作，保证征购工作的任何一个环节都不致被其它工作挤掉；而且，在一定时期内，要把征购工作放在最重要的地位。现在大规模的征购工作就要开始了。希望各地抓紧时机，动员群众，鼓足干劲，为全面地胜利地完成夏粮和油料的征购任务而奋斗。
