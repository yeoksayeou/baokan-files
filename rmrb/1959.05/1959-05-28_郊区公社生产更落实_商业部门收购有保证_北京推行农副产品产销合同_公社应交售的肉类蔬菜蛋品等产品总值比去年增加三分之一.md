Xinhua News Agency, May 27th. Beijing's relevant commercial departments and suburban people's communes are widely promoting a system of production and sales contracts for agricultural and sideline products. This assists the people's communes in carrying out agricultural and sideline production in a planned way, while also providing commercial departments with a reliable guarantee for fulfilling their procurement tasks.

To date, commercial departments have signed over 1,700 production and sales contracts with suburban people's communes for meat, poultry, eggs, vegetables, fresh and dried fruits, and native products. According to statistics from nine districts (counties), including Changping, the contracts stipulate that communes must sell to the state over 200 types of products, including live pigs, fresh eggs, vegetables, fresh and dried fruits, wickerwork, wooden tools, medicinal herbs, and sheepskins, with a total value of over 70 million yuan, exceeding the total procurement amount of these nine districts last year by 36%.

The contracts, based on past operational conditions, the production of agricultural, sideline, and native products, and the needs of the state, make specific provisions for the variety, quantity, specifications, quality, delivery time, and delivery location of the products. The Tongzhou District Commercial Bureau not only assists the people's communes in conducting surveys of products, quantities, labor, and production channels, but also comprehensively plans the communes' production tasks in conjunction with the size and value of the products, the seasonality of production, and the needs of the state and commune members. Some sideline production projects that had been suspended due to a lack of planning in the past, such as binding brooms and processing small wooden goods, have also resumed production.

Many areas, after signing the contracts, have paid attention to implementing them at all levels and have taken measures to do everything possible to fulfill the production and sales tasks stipulated in the contracts. In Changping District, the commercial bureau and the communes, the commune's financial and trade departments and management areas, and the central stores and production teams have all signed separate contracts. In the Liangxiang Commune of Zhoukoudian District, in addition to a secretary responsible for contract work, each production team also has a team leader responsible for this work; furthermore, through full discussion among the masses, the importance of implementing the contract system is repeatedly clarified, giving the contract a solid mass foundation. Currently, this commune has mobilized more than 2,000 commune members to form 28 specialized teams, intensifying production in accordance with the tasks stipulated in the contracts. According to the contract tasks, the communes in Changping District have organized 42 sideline professional teams, totaling more than 1,000 people, and are carrying out various sideline production activities, producing and selling more than 900,000 jin of medicinal herbs and more than 400,000 jin of wicker to the state in April alone. After signing the contract, the Chengguan Commune in Huairou County strengthened the management of pig fattening, and from April 1st to 20th, sold 1,047 fat pigs to the state, over fulfilling the second quarter sales plan stipulated in the contract.

In order to ensure that the contracts are implemented, commercial departments, in addition to sending cadres to go deep into the communes and teams to understand the problems existing in production at any time, also actively help the communes develop production in accordance with the needs of the city. The Tongzhou District Commercial Bureau helped the communes in the district establish seven incubation workshops, planned to plant more than 200,000 seed eggs, supplied more than 500,000 jin of various vegetable seeds, and supported the communes in developing poultry and vegetable production. The Daxing District Commercial Bureau decided to support the communes' production work by helping each production team to calculate detailed accounts, provide production channels, arrange production, and guarantee the purchase of products. The Anding Central Store in this district helped each production team to start ten sideline production activities, such as willow weaving, wood processing, brick burning, charcoal burning, potassium carbonate, and sewing.

    郊区公社生产更落实  商业部门收购有保证
    北京推行农副产品产销合同
    公社应交售的肉类蔬菜蛋品等产品总值比去年增加三分之一
    新华社27日讯  北京有关商业部门和郊区人民公社，广泛推行农副产品产销合同制，协助人民公社有计划地进行农副业生产，同时使商业部门完成收购任务有了可靠的保证。
    到目前为止，商业部门与郊区人民公社签订的肉类、禽、蛋、蔬菜、干鲜果品和土特产品产销合同已有一千七百多份。据昌平等九个区（县）的统计，合同规定公社需向国家交售的有生猪、鲜蛋、蔬菜、干鲜果品、荆柳编制品、木制工具、药材、羊皮等二百多种产品，总值达七千多万元，超过这九个区去年收购总额36％。
    合同根据历年经营情况、农副土特产品的生产情况和国家的需要，对产品的品种、数量、规格、质量、交售时间、交售地点等都作了具体规定。通州区商业局不但协助各人民公社做好产品、数量、劳力和生产门路的调查，同时还结合产品的大小、价值、生产的季节性和国家、社员需要的情况，全面规划了公社的生产任务，有些因过去缺乏安排而停顿下来的副业生产项目，如绑条帚、加工小木货等也恢复了生产。
    许多地区在合同签订后，都注意把合同层层落实，并采取措施，千方百计地完成合同规定的生产和交售任务。昌平区的商业局和公社，公社的财贸部和管理区，中心商店和生产队，都分别订立了合同。周口店区良乡公社除有一名书记负责合同工作外，各生产队还有一名队长负责这件工作；并且通过群众充分讨论，反复讲清实行合同制的重要意义，使合同有了充分的群众基础。现在，这个公社已发动二千多名社员组成二十八个专业队，按合同规定的任务加紧生产。昌平区各公社根据合同任务，因地制宜，组织了四十二个共一千多人的副业专业队，开展各项副业生产，仅4月份生产交售给国家的药材就有九十多万斤、荆条四十多万斤。怀柔县城关公社订立合同后，加强了生猪育肥管理，从4月1日到20日，交售给国家的肥猪有一千零四十七头，超额完成了合同规定的第二季度交售计划。
    为了使合同落实，商业部门除派出干部深入社队随时了解生产上存在的问题外，并按照城市需要，积极帮助公社发展生产。通州区商业局帮助本区公社建立孵化坊七处，筹划种蛋二十多万个，供应各种菜籽五十多万斤，支援公社发展家禽和蔬菜生产。大兴区商业局决定从帮助各生产队算细账、提供生产门路、安排生产、包收产品等方面来支持公社的生产工作，这个区的安定中心商店帮助各生产队搞起柳编、木器加工、烧砖、烧炭、碳酸钾、缝纫等十项副业生产。（附图片）
