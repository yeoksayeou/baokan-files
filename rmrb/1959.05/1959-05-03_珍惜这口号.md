Cherish This Slogan
HINDI CHEENI BHAI BHAI! Indian and Chinese people are brothers! How warm this slogan is, it has spread throughout the Ganges River valley, it has become a moving song. Deep friendship, overflowing in the hearts of the people of both countries. A gust of sinister wind blew from the devil's cave, and bad people vainly attempted to tamper with the slogan. HINDI CHEENI BHAI BHAI, turned into HINDI CHEENI GOOD-BYE, which means, "Indian and Chinese people, goodbye!" It curses the friendship between the Chinese and Indian people to be over! Bah! Righteous friendship will never be broken up, the Chinese people still want to shout long live Sino-Indian friendship! Just like the Indian people want to continue singing: HINDI CHEENI BHAI BHAI! Dear Indian brothers and sisters! Let us protect this slogan together, cherish this pure Hindi phrase, don't let it be replaced by a sinister English phrase!

What is this picture?!
　　That’s　more like　it！
The above picture is a cartoon published by the "Indian Times" on April 2nd, inciting the destruction of Sino-Indian relations. In the picture, the original writing on the wall was "Indian and Chinese people are brothers," but it has been rewritten, and the rewritten meaning is: "Indian and Chinese people, goodbye." The original title under the cartoon is: "That’s more like it!"

    珍惜这口号
    袁水拍HINDI　CHEENI　BHAI　BHAI！印中人民是兄弟！这口号多么亲切，它传遍了恒河流域，它变成了一支动人的歌曲。深厚的友谊啊，在两国人民的心头洋溢。一阵阴风从魔窟吹来，坏人妄想把口号篡改，HINDI　CHEENI　 BHAI　BHAI，变成了HINDI　CHEENI　GOOD—BYE，这是说，“印中人民再会！”它诅咒中印人民的友谊完蛋！呸！正义的友谊永远冲不散，中国人民还是要高呼中印友好万岁！就像印度人民要继续歌唱：HINDI　CHEENI　BHAI　BHAI！亲爱的印度兄弟姊妹！让我们一起来把这口号保卫，珍惜这句纯洁的印度话吧，别让它被一句阴险的英国话替代！（附图片）
    这是什么画？！
      That’s　more like　it！
    上图是“印度时报”4月2日刊载的煽动破坏中印关系的漫画。图中墙上原来写的是“印中人民是兄弟”，但已被改写，改写后的意思是：“印中人民再见”。漫画下面的原标题是：“这更像一些！”
