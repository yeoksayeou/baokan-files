Comrades and Committee Members:
    After listening to Premier Zhou Enlai's Government Work Report, Vice Premier Li Fuchun's draft report on the 1959 National Economic Plan, and Vice Premier Li Xiannian's draft final accounts budget report at this National People's Congress, I have a more comprehensive understanding of the correctness of the general line for socialist construction formulated by the Party and Chairman Mao, and the enormous power unleashed by mobilizing the enthusiasm of the people across the country to build socialism. As a converter steelmaker, I contributed too little during the great leap forward of "1070". I must continue to work hard and find every possible way to contribute all my strength to the new "1800" target.

    Have the Conditions and Confidence to Complete this Year’s Task
    The planned steel production for 1959 is 6.92 million tons more than in 1958, and the quality requirements for steel are also higher than in 1958. Therefore, it is a more glorious and also a more arduous task.
    The conclusion drawn from the converter steelmaking's great leap forward in 1958 is that: factories can be built quickly and productivity is high. Therefore, in the second half of the year, nearly a thousand large and small converters emerged, ensuring the overfulfillment of the target. Among them, the small, indigenous converters of less than 200 kilograms created unexpected miracles, opening up new avenues for converter design. For example, conventionally, the smaller the furnace volume, the shorter the furnace life. Considering that the life of a 3-ton to 5-ton converter is only about 50 heats, a 200-kilogram small converter with a furnace lining only four inches thick would not even reach a dozen heats at most; however, due to different air supply and slag flow conditions, it actually refined more than 100 heats, and the furnace lining was not yet eroded. Furthermore, small converters often cannot obtain blowers with appropriate wind pressure, which makes steelmaking difficult; however, in some cases, due to the smooth slag flow on the surface of the molten pool, it is still possible to tap the steel in a timely and smooth manner with low wind pressure. In the process of this hard work, practical work, and ingenious work, many new achievements have emerged, leading to new concepts about the airflow between slag and iron.
    Most of the newly built converters did not fully utilize their production capacity in the great leap forward of 1958. Some were completed in the late fourth quarter, which is basically equivalent to no production; some were completed earlier, but due to inexperience, the output was very low. Therefore, if all of them are put into action in 1959, overfulfilling the task should be guaranteed in terms of equipment capacity.
    Regarding the weakness of technical strength in the new factories, in addition to sending out many working groups, the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry convened a national converter steelmaking conference in Shanghai last month, gathering more than 500 representatives from local metallurgical bureaus and steel enterprises to exchange and summarize production technology experience, publish reports by Chinese and foreign experts, formulate key technical operations, and discuss measures to solve problems; in the shortest period, converter training classes will be opened to train a new team to participate in production across the country; from the third quarter of 1958, the Metallurgical Industry Publishing House has successively printed more than ten kinds of steelmaking booklets, and together with steel companies, selected the production data of converter steelmaking in our country over the past seven years and compiled them into a side-blown converter steelmaking special issue for distribution; in terms of improving technical level, enriching technical strength, and providing reference materials and instructions on operation methods, all necessary work has been carried out step by step, so from the perspective of production technology, overfulfilling the task can also be guaranteed.
    Premier Zhou Enlai said in his government work report that we are still lagging behind in science and technology and must step up our efforts. The task of directly serving production and construction should be given top priority. On all fronts of production and construction, there are thousands of technical problems, and scientific and technological workers should cooperate and work hard to solve these problems. This instruction is also very correct for converter steelmaking. With such a reasonable arrangement already in place, and with the confidence to guarantee the completion of the production task, we must work harder to solve the most pressing problems on the production front.

    Summarize the Theory of Side-Blown Converters and Improve Steelmaking Technology
    Side-blown alkaline converter steelmaking has made outstanding achievements in our country that have never been seen in other countries. No advanced experience and data of side-blown converters can be found in the steelmaking literature of various countries, so all innovation work must be explored by ourselves. We have more than seven years of production experience with side-blown alkaline converters and have accumulated many valuable data. We should use these data to enrich the theory, and then use the theory enriched with side-blown converter data to guide production, so that theory is combined with practice to ensure quality, eliminate defective products and cold steel, and reduce slag volume, so that side-blown converters can truly become a multi-speed, good, and economical steelmaking tool, and can further guarantee the completion and overfulfillment of the 1959 plan.
    Due to the differences in the shape of the converters, with vortex drums and straight cylinders, and the capacity ranging from one ton to twelve tons, and the air supply equipment varying in size, they are built in different parts of the country. In such a vast region, using iron ore of different compositions to refine various kinds of pig iron as raw materials, there must be a correct theoretical basis to check the furnace shape, wind pressure, and slag in the furnace, so as to flexibly adapt to various different conditions of production, to ensure the quality of steel and achieve the purpose of saving and increasing production.
    Under such complex conditions, the experience summed up by Factory A cannot be mechanically applied to Factory B, and even the effective operating data in Factory A are difficult to achieve the same results without verification and modification; therefore, while absorbing advanced experience and data, we must combine them with the actual situation and analyze and calculate them before they can be used reasonably. This requires a set of calculation methods based on theory; otherwise, if a lot of experience and data are collected, they cannot be selected without dialectical analysis, and they cannot be corrected without trial calculation and comparison.
    In terms of theory, open-hearth steelmaking has developed quite completely. Side-blown converters and open-hearth furnaces are basically the same in principle, but due to the difference in heat supply and reaction intensity, there are great differences in specific applications; therefore, to use the existing theory of open-hearth furnaces, we must consider the specific situation and combine it with the characteristics of side-blown converters to conform to reality.
    Comrades standing at production posts feel that they cannot grasp the various formulas and high-level theoretical parts of thermochemistry that guide research, and they cannot apply them. What they want is a simple algorithm that goes straight to the point and a practical theory that is easy to understand. Unfortunately, the formulas in the book have not been evolved into simple formulas for them to directly make trial calculations, and there is also a lack of a complete set of theory combined with reality. Therefore, they very much hope to get more realistic, more specific, easier to understand, and systematic reference materials.
    Now we have the experience data obtained from production labor by various factories across the country over the past few years. If we can combine it with the theoretical basis that has been developed on open-hearth furnaces, we can obtain a complete set of theory and calculation methods that meet the requirements of the masses after processing, and we can produce different types of steel according to different pig iron raw materials, and obtain the most reasonable batching and operating methods under different furnace types and different air supply conditions. If this work can be completed, I think it will play a great role in improving the technical level of the masses, ensuring the quality of steel production in 1959, and carrying out the technological revolution.
    This is a collective work of metallurgy, refractory materials, and fluid mechanics. Before such a collective force is organized to solve such problems, the results I have obtained in the past will be compiled into a book and dedicated to the people as reference materials for the time being. I also hope that it can be organized later, with division of labor and cooperation, to complete a more comprehensive and more correct theory and calculation of converter steelmaking with collective strength.
    At the time when the National People's Congress is being held in our country, the Tibetan rebels, supported by imperialism, kidnapped the Dalai Lama and fabricated the absurd so-called "Statement of the Dalai Lama," arousing our strong indignation. We must turn all our indignation into the power to accelerate production and construction. Tibet is forever an inseparable part of our country's territory. Any activities of imperialism must be completely bankrupt.

    决心为生产一千八百万吨钢贡献全副力量
    余名钰委员的发言各位委员：
  在这次全国人民代表大会上听了周恩来总理的政府工作报告，李富春副总理的一九五九年国民经济计划草案报告和李先念副总理的决算预算草案报告，使我更全面地认识到党和毛主席制定建设社会主义总路线的正确及其发动全国人民建设社会主义积极性所发挥力量的巨大。我是一个转炉炼钢者，在“一○七○”的大跃进中所出的力量太少，必须再接再厉，想一切办法为“一八○○”新指标贡献所有力量。
    有条件有信心完成今年任务
    一九五九年钢的计划产量比一九五八年多六百九十二万吨，同时对钢的质量要求比一九五八年高，所以是一个更光荣，而也是更艰巨的任务。
    转炉炼钢在一九五八年的生产大跃进中所得到的结论是：建厂快而生产力大，所以在下半年里，出现了近千座的大小转炉，保证了超额完成指标的任务。其中也有洋带土的二百公斤以下小转炉创造了出人意料的奇迹，替设计转炉方面开辟了新途径。譬如，习惯上都是炉容积越少则炉龄越短。鉴于三吨至五吨的转炉只有五十多炉寿命，一个炉衬只有四寸多厚的二百公斤小转炉最多也达不到十几炉；但由于供风和渣流情况不同，居然炼到一百炉以上，炉衬还未被蚀穿。还有，小转炉往往得不到风压适当的鼓风机，因此使得炼钢困难；但其中也有个别的由于熔池面上渣流顺畅，还是能做到用低风压及时地顺利出钢。在这种苦干、实干和巧干的过程中，产生了许多新的事迹，引出气流对渣铁之间所发生的新概念。
    多数的新建转炉在一九五八年大跃进中都没有充分发挥其生产能力，有的在第四季后期才建成，基本上等于没有生产；有的建成较早，但由于炉新人生，产量很少；所以在一九五九年中全部行动起来，从设备能力来讲超额完成任务应该可以得到保证的。
    对新厂里技术力量薄弱这一点上，冶金工业部除了派出许多工作组外；上月在上海召集各地冶金局和钢铁企业代表五百多人，开了全国转炉炼钢会议，交流和总结了生产技术经验，发表了中外专家的报告，制定了技术操作要点，讨论了解决问题的措施；在最短期间内，即将开设转炉训练班，培养一批参加各地生产的新队伍；从一九五八年第三季起，冶金工业出版社陆续印发了十余种炼钢小册子，并与钢铁公司一起选集了我国七年来转炉炼钢的生产资料合编成侧吹转炉炼钢专辑发行；在提高技术水平、充实技术力量与供给参考资料和指示操作方法上，已经有步骤地做了一切应有的工作，所以从生产技术来讲，超额完成任务也能得到保证的。
    周恩来总理在政府工作报告中说，在科学技术上，我们现在还是落后的，必须加紧努力。直接为生产建设服务的任务，应当放在首要的地位。在生产建设的各个战线上，存在着千千万万的技术课题，科学技术工作者应当分工协作，为解决这些课题而努力。对转炉炼钢来说这个指示也是十分正确的。在已经有了这样合理的安排，有信心能够保证完成生产任务的情况下，还得加紧努力，来解决生产战线上最迫切的问题。
    总结侧吹转炉理论   提高炼钢技术水平
    侧吹碱性转炉炼钢在我国有了突出的成就而为其它各国所未曾有过的。在各国的炼钢文献中找不到侧吹转炉的先进经验和数据，所以一切革新工作都要靠自己去发掘。我们对侧吹碱性转炉有了七年多的生产经验，积累了许多有价值的数据，应该把这些数据去充实理论，然后把充实了侧吹转炉数据的理论来指导生产，使理论结合实践，以保证质量，消灭废品和冷钢，并减少渣量，使侧吹转炉真正成为多快好省的炼钢工具，也能更进一步地保证一九五九年计划的完成和超额完成。
    由于转炉的形状有涡鼓和直筒的区别，容量大小由一吨到十二吨都有，供风设备大小不一，分建在全国各地。这样辽阔的区域，用不同成分的铁矿炼出多种多样的生铁作原料，必须有正确的理论作基础来核定炉内型、风压和炉渣，才能灵活地适应各种不同条件的生产，以确保钢的质量而做到节约增产的目的。
    在这样错综复杂的条件下，甲厂总结出的经验固然不能一成不变地搬到乙厂去用，就是甲厂里行之有效的操作数据，也很难不加核改而能得到同样成就；因此，在吸收先进经验和数据的同时，必须结合实际情况，加以分析和核算，才能合理使用。这就需要一套以理论为基础的核算方法，否则，汇集的经验和数据很多，不能辩证分析就无从选择，不能试算比较就无法改正。
    在理论方面，平炉炼钢已经发展得相当完备。侧吹转炉和平炉在原则性的理论上是基本相同的，不过由于热量供应与反应强度的不同，在具体应用上则大有出入；所以要利用平炉的现成理论，必须考虑到具体情况，结合侧吹转炉的特性，才能符合实际。
    站在生产岗位上的同志们，对指导研究的各种公式和热化学中高深部分的理论，感到摸不着底而无从应用。他们所要的是一种单刀直入的简易算法和一讲就懂的实用理论。可惜书本子的公式没有演成可供他们直接作试算用的简易公式，也缺乏结合实际的全套理论，因此，很希望能得到更现实，更具体，更容易了解而有系统的参考资料。
    现在有了全国各厂几年来从生产劳动中得到的经验数据，若能结合平炉上所已经发展到的理论依据，经过加工是能得出合乎群众要求的成套理论和核算方法，可以按图索骥地根据不同生铁原料，生产不同的钢种，在不同炉型和不同供风条件下，得出最合理的配料和操作方法的。若能完成这样工作，我想在提高群众技术水平，保证完成一九五九年产钢质量和开展技术革命方面，都会起到很大作用的。
    这是冶金、耐火材料和流体力学三科的集体工作，在未曾组织起这样一个集体力量去解决这样的课题之前，现在先就个人以往所得出的结果，整理成册，献给人民，作为目前的参考资料。还希随后能够组织起来，分工协作，以集体的力量来完成更全面而更正确的转炉炼钢理论和计算。
    正在我国召开人民代表大会会议的时期，受帝国主义支持的西藏叛徒，劫持达赖喇嘛，捏造出荒谬无比的所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”，激起我们强烈的愤慨。我们要把所有的愤慨化做加快生产建设的力量。西藏永远是我国领土不可分割的一部分。帝国主义的任何活动一定要彻底破产。
