Comrade Representatives:

We fully endorse the "Government Work Report" made by Premier Zhou Enlai, as well as the reports by Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen.

Premier Zhou's report sternly condemned the crimes of the former Tibetan local government and upper-class reactionary elements in launching an armed rebellion, splitting national unity, and undermining the unification of the motherland. Some time ago, the State Council ordered the dissolution of the former Tibetan local government and ordered the People's Liberation Army to swiftly quell the rebellion. These actions represented the will and demands of all ethnic groups, and we unanimously express our resolute support.

The Tibetan upper-class reactionary clique, colluding with imperialists and Indian expansionists to launch an armed rebellion, attempted to turn Tibet into an imperialist colony in order to perpetually maintain the dark rule of the Tibetan serf system. Therefore, the essence of the Tibetan upper-class reactionary clique's armed rebellion was to betray the motherland and the interests of the Tibetan people. They are traitors to the motherland and to the nation. They were instigated and plotted by imperialists and Indian expansionists. The unification of the motherland is the highest interest of all nationalities. The armed rebellion of the Tibetan upper-class reactionary clique was a sabotage of the motherland's unification, a sabotage of the interests of all nationalities, especially the Tibetan people. The Li, Miao, and Yao people of Guangdong have suffered from Japanese imperialist aggression and massacre, lived a slave-like tragic life, and suffered from the cruel oppression and exploitation of the Kuomintang reactionaries and the painful lessons of creating ethnic disputes. In those difficult days, our Li, Miao, and Yao people, under the direct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and united with the Han people, went through a long and arduous struggle to achieve revolutionary victory, national independence, and national liberation. Therefore, our Li, Miao, and Yao people deeply feel that the Communist Party is truly the savior of all ethnic groups; we deeply feel the extreme value of the motherland's unification and the close unity of all nationalities. Therefore, we feel extremely indignant at the treasonous crimes of the Tibetan upper-class reactionary clique, who conspired to turn Tibet into an imperialist colony.

Under the unified leadership of the Central People's Government, implementing ethnic regional autonomy is the fundamental policy for realizing ethnic equality, strengthening ethnic unity, and safeguarding the unification of the motherland. This is the profound and personal experience gained by the Li, Miao, and Yao people of Guangdong in the actual practice of ethnic regional autonomy. However, in order to split national unity and undermine the unification of the motherland, the Tibetan upper-class reactionary clique has, over the years, tried every possible means to sabotage the Seventeen-Article Agreement for the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet and obstructed the Tibetan people's desire to realize ethnic regional autonomy. From this, people can clearly see that what the Tibetan upper-class reactionary clique wanted was not ethnic regional autonomy, but to use the banner of demanding ethnic regional autonomy as a guise, pretending to be representatives who safeguard ethnic interests, and, according to the orders of imperialism, demanding "Tibetan independence." Their conspiracy to launch an armed rebellion was to achieve the goal of "Tibetan independence." If their conspiracy had succeeded, Tibet would have become an imperialist colony, and the Tibetan people would have lived an extremely tragic life. No wonder that just as the Tibetan upper-class reactionary clique's armed rebellion suffered a disastrous defeat, all ethnic groups in the country felt jubilant and inspired, while all reactionaries at home and abroad felt pessimistic and disappointed.

A handful of right-wing elements and local nationalist elements in the Li and Miao Autonomous Prefecture once clamored in 1956, "The mountains are the mountains of the Li people, the land is the land of the Li people," "Han people govern Han people, Li people govern Li people." They slandered the state's mining and reclamation in the autonomous prefecture as "Han people's invasion of the Li people." They attempted to use ethnic components to split national unity and undermine the unification of the motherland. However, this reactionary conspiracy was completely crushed after the rectification campaign and the anti-rightist struggle. The Indian interventionist elements and the Tibetan upper-class reactionary clique fabricated lies, repeatedly claiming that Tibetans are different from the Han Chinese, that Tibet is a "country," and thus slanderously claiming that China's suppression of the Tibetan rebellion was "interference in Tibet's internal affairs." We believe that this is a trick commonly used by all reactionaries, and it is the same as the reactionary fallacies of the right-wing elements in the autonomous prefecture. Tibet is Chinese territory, and the Tibetan nationality is a member of the Chinese national family. The Chinese People's Liberation Army, with the active support of the Tibetan people, quickly quelled the armed rebellion of the reactionary clique, expressing the wishes of all ethnic groups in the country, especially the Tibetan people. To slander this desire of all ethnic groups in the country, especially the Tibetan people, to safeguard the unification of the motherland and to safeguard national unity as interference in Tibet's internal affairs can be said to be absurd to the extreme. On the contrary, it proves that imperialism and foreign reactionaries are engaging in activities that interfere in China's internal affairs.

Under the unified leadership of the Party and the Central People's Government, the Li, Miao, and Yao ethnic groups in Hainan have carried out democratic reforms and the socialist revolution. The socialist construction undertaking has been developing vigorously. Grain production has changed from relying on supplies and relief from other places to being self-sufficient and more; industry, culture, and education have grown from scratch; health has changed from relying on gods and ghosts for medical treatment, resulting in family ruin and death, to the emergence of two "malaria-free counties" – Lingshui and Baoting.

Since liberation, our Li, Miao, and Yao ethnic groups, under the unified leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the Central People's Government, have resolutely implemented the Party's ethnic policy, established the autonomous organs of the Hainan Li and Miao Autonomous Prefecture and the Liannan Yao Autonomous County, and then, under the leadership of the Party and the higher-level government, completed democratic reforms. With the high tide of the national socialist revolution, the socialist transformation of the ownership of the means of production was basically completed. In 1957, we launched rural socialist education and a nationwide rectification movement, carried out the struggle against the rightists and against local nationalism, and achieved great victories in the socialist revolution on the political and ideological fronts. On this basis, in 1958, we resolutely implemented the Party's general line for socialist construction, repeatedly opposed right-leaning conservatism, broke superstitions, emancipated our minds, launched a large-scale mass movement, and made a big fuss about technological revolution. Especially with the large amount of financial, material, and human assistance from the state and the Han people, the socialist construction undertaking in various ethnic minority areas of Guangdong, like other parts of the country, has achieved a great leap forward and realized the people's commune system. In our Li, Miao, and Yao areas, which have historically been particularly backward in production technology, with very low productivity and a very poor people's livelihood, there was a grain shortage for about half a year every year. Before 1957, the Li and Miao Autonomous Prefecture had to transfer 40 million catties of rice from other places every year, but after the agricultural cooperative movement, grain production has grown year by year, averaging about 160 million catties per year for six years. The largest leap forward was in 1958, when the total output of the prefecture reached about 1.2 billion catties, an increase of more than three times compared to 260 million catties in 1952, and an increase of 720 million catties compared to 480 million catties in 1957. The output per unit area reached more than 1,100 catties per mu in 1958, an increase of about 810 catties compared to 290 catties in 1957. Since then, we have removed the hat of low-yield areas and ended the history of grain shortages. In the Liannan Yao area, since liberation, not only has no public grain been paid, but also the state has transferred a large amount of grain from other places to supply and provide relief every year. However, due to the great leap forward in grain production in 1958, in addition to overfulfilling the task of public grain purchase, there was more than enough grain for self-sufficiency. Now, all the communes can eat their fill and eat well, and the days of hunger are gone forever. At the same time as the great leap forward in grain production, economic crops have also achieved very significant results. From 1953 to 1958, the Li and Miao Autonomous Prefecture planted more than 830,000 mu of long-term economic crops. As for animal husbandry, aquaculture, agriculture and forestry, etc., they have also developed rapidly.

Our motherland was originally "poor and blank," and it can be said that our ethnic minority areas were even "poorer and blanker." In the long history of the past, not only were there no large factories, but even the most rudimentary handicrafts were rare or non-existent. In the past few years, the industry in our region has also developed along with the development of agriculture, especially after the implementation of the policy of the whole Party and the whole people running industry, townships and communes running industry, and combining foreign and indigenous methods in 1958, various industries have developed like mushrooms after rain. In 1952, the Hainan Li and Miao Autonomous Prefecture had only 12 simple processing factories, which increased to 1,820 in 1958, an increase of more than 100 times. In 1958, the total industrial output value reached 76.73 million yuan, an increase of more than 30 times compared to 1952. The Liannan Yao Autonomous County established 47 factories of various sizes in one year in 1958, ending the history of our ethnic minority areas without a steel industry.

Before liberation, due to poverty and oppression, the cultural and educational undertakings in ethnic minority areas were very backward. There was not even a decent primary school, and it was difficult to find a literate person in the vast rural areas. After liberation, the Party and the government were very concerned about the cultural and educational undertakings of the ethnic minorities and vigorously established many schools. In 1958, the Li and Miao Autonomous Prefecture had 790 primary schools, an increase of 74 percent compared to 1952, with 94,700 students, an increase of 91 percent compared to 1952; 84 middle schools, an increase of 26 times compared to 1952, with nearly 10,000 students, an increase of more than four times compared to 1952. In addition, there was one teachers college and three Red and Expert schools, with more than 1,000 students. At present, on average, there is one student for every seven people in the prefecture. In 1958, Liannan County had 143 primary schools, an increase of 120 percent compared to 1952; 11,600 primary school students, an increase of 110 percent compared to 1952; 5 middle schools, an increase of 80 percent compared to 1952, and the number of middle school students increased by more than two times compared to 1952. With the development of cultural and educational undertakings and the improvement of people's political consciousness, with the improvement of people's material life, the broad masses of the people urgently demand to become cultured laborers. The literacy campaign has achieved great success, and about 60 percent of the young people have left the state of illiteracy. With the rapid development of education, cultural undertakings have also developed rapidly. Now, cultural centers, libraries, Xinhua bookstores, newspaper offices, film teams, and other various literary and art organizations have been established everywhere.

For centuries, our Li, Miao, and Yao people have been politically oppressed, economically exploited, and suffered from poverty and disease. They lacked scientific knowledge and fundamentally could not pay attention to hygiene. When people got sick, they would kill cattle and pigs, ask gods and worship ghosts, and treat gods and ghosts as doctors, and the result was just family ruin and death. After liberation, with the vigorous help of the Party and the government, a large number of medical personnel were sent, a large number of medical institutions were established, and a mass movement to promote hygiene and eliminate the four pests was launched. People's diseases have been greatly reduced, and the mortality rate has been greatly reduced. Lingshui and Baoting counties in the Hainan Li and Miao Autonomous Prefecture basically achieved "malaria-free counties" in September 1958.

The above facts powerfully demonstrate the development of socialist construction undertakings in various ethnic minority areas of Guangdong, which are leaping forward at a speed of "one day equals twenty years." We believe that the Li, Miao, and Yao people will certainly be able to work together with all ethnic groups in the country along the socialist road to build a great socialist motherland with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern culture and science, and at the same time join the ranks of advanced nationalities, making the Li, Miao, and Yao nationalities advanced socialist nationalities.

Under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and the Central People's Government, with the active assistance of all fraternal nationalities, especially the Han people, the Li, Miao, and Yao ethnic groups have victoriously completed the tasks of democratic reform and socialist transformation, liberated the social productive forces, and raised the political consciousness of the people. Especially under the illumination and encouragement of the Party's general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, everyone is full of vigor, high morale, and has displayed the communist style of daring to think, daring to act, and daring to speak. Therefore, they can make the same leap forward in the construction of socialism as the Han areas. Therefore, based on the personal experience of our own ethnic group, we realize that the Tibetan region must realize ethnic regional autonomy under the unified leadership of the motherland, and gradually carry out democratic reforms and socialist transformation. Only in this way can the social productive forces be liberated, the people's class consciousness be raised, national unity be strengthened, and the unification of the motherland be safeguarded. Only in this way can the Tibetan people and all ethnic groups in the country advance bravely along the socialist road of common prosperity.

　　祖国的统一是各民族的最高利益
    林岳川　陈斯德　邵良础代表的联合发言各位代表：
    我们完全拥护周恩来总理所作的“政府工作报告”以及李富春副总理、李先念副总理和彭真副委员长的报告。
    周总理的报告严斥了原西藏地方政府和上层反动分子进行武装叛乱，分裂民族团结，破坏祖国统一的罪行。前些时候，国务院命令解散原西藏地方政府和命令人民解放军迅速平息叛乱，这都是代表各族人民的意志和要求，我们一致表示坚决拥护。
    西藏上层反动集团勾结帝国主义和印度扩张主义者进行武装叛乱，是企图把西藏变为帝国主义的殖民地，以便永远地保持西藏农奴制度的黑暗统治，因此，西藏上层反动集团进行武装叛乱的实质，是出卖祖国，出卖西藏民族利益的，是祖国的罪人，民族的叛徒，他们是受帝国主义和印度扩张主义者唆使和策动的。祖国的统一是各民族的最高利益。西藏上层反动集团武装叛乱就是破坏祖国的统一，就是破坏各民族特别是西藏人民的利益。我们广东黎、苗、瑶族的人民受过日本帝国主义的侵略、残杀，过着奴隶式的悲惨生活，受过国民党反动派的残酷压迫和剥削以及制造民族纠纷的惨痛教训。在这些苦难的日子里，我们黎、苗、瑶族人民，在中国共产党的直接领导下和汉族人民团结一致，经过长期的艰苦斗争，才取得革命的胜利，祖国获得独立，民族获得解放。因此，我们黎、苗、瑶族人民深深感到共产党真正是各族人民的救星；深深感到祖国的统一，各民族的亲密团结的非常可贵。因此，我们对西藏上层反动集团阴谋把西藏变为帝国主义殖民地的叛国罪行感到非常愤恨。
    在中央人民政府统一领导下，贯彻民族区域自治，是实现民族平等、加强民族团结、维护祖国统一的根本政策，这是广东黎族、苗族、瑶族在实现民族区域自治的实际生活中所得到的切身体会。但是西藏上层反动集团为了分裂民族团结，破坏祖国统一，几年来千方百计地破坏和平解放西藏的十七条协议，阻挠西藏人民要求实现民族区域自治的愿望，从此人们可以清楚地看到，西藏上层反动集团所要的，不是什么民族地方自治，而是打着要求民族地方自治的幌子，伪装维护民族利益的代表者，遵照帝国主义的命令，要求“西藏独立”。他们进行武装叛乱的阴谋就是为了实现“西藏独立”的目的，如果他们的阴谋得逞，西藏就要变为帝国主义的殖民地，西藏人民就将过着极为悲惨的生活。怪不得正当西藏上层反动集团武装叛乱惨败的时候，全国各族人民感到欢欣鼓舞，而国内外一切反动派则感到悲观失望。
    黎族苗族自治州一小撮右派分子和地方民族主义分子，一九五六年也曾经一度大叫“山是黎人之山、地是黎人之地”、“汉人管汉人，黎人管黎人”，他们把国家在自治州进行开矿，垦殖，诬蔑为“汉人侵略黎人”，他们企图以民族成分来分裂民族团结，破坏祖国统一。可是这个反动阴谋，经过整风、反右派斗争就完全被粉碎了。印度干涉主义分子和西藏上层反动集团的谎话连篇，口口声声说西藏人不同于中国的汉人，西藏是一个“国家”，从而诬蔑中国平息西藏叛乱为“干涉西藏内政”，我们认为这是一切反动派所惯用的伎俩，和自治州右派反动谬论同出一辙。西藏是中国的领土，西藏民族是中国民族大家庭中的一个成员，中国人民解放军在西藏人民的积极支持下迅速平息反动集团的武装叛乱，表达了全国各族人民特别是西藏人民的愿望。把全国各族人民特别是西藏人民的维护祖国统一、维护民族团结的这种愿望诬蔑为干涉西藏内政，可说是荒谬绝伦，相反的证明了帝国主义和外国反动派正在干着干涉中国内政的勾当。
    我们海南黎、苗、瑶各族人民，在党和中央人民政府的统一领导下，进行了民主改革和社会主义革命，社会主义建设事业得到蓬勃发展，粮食生产由过去靠外地供应和救济变为自给有余；工业、文化教育事业从无到有；卫生由过去以神鬼为医、家破人亡到出现两个“无疟县”——陵水、保亭。
    自从解放以来，我们黎、苗、瑶等族人民在中国共产党和中央人民政府的统一领导下，坚决贯彻执行党的民族政策，建立了海南黎族苗族自治州和连南瑶族自治县的自治机关，接着在党和上级政府的领导下，完成了民主改革，随着全国社会主义革命高潮，基本完成了生产资料所有制的社会主义改造。一九五七年又开展了农村社会主义教育和全民整风运动，进行了反右派、反地方民族主义的斗争，取得了政治战线和思想战线上的社会主义革命的巨大胜利。在这个基础上，一九五八年坚决贯彻党的社会主义建设总路线，反复的反对右倾保守，破除迷信，解放思想，大搞群众运动，大闹技术革命。特别是在国家及汉族人民在财力、物力、人力的大量帮助下，广东各个民族地区和全国各地一样，社会主义建设事业获得大跃进，并实现了人民公社化。我们黎、苗、瑶族地区在历史上生产技术特别落后，生产力很低，人民生活很贫困，每年约有半年时间闹粮荒，黎族苗族自治州于一九五七年前每年要从外地调入大米四千万斤，但经过农业合作化运动，粮食生产获得逐年增长，六年来平均每年增长一亿六千万斤左右，跃进幅度最大的是一九五八年，全州总产量达到十二亿斤左右，比一九五二年的二亿六千万斤增长了三倍多，比一九五七年四亿八千万斤增加七亿二千万斤。单位面积产量，一九五八年达到每亩一千一百斤以上，比一九五七年二百九十斤增加八百一十斤左右，从此摘掉了低产区的帽子，结束了闹粮荒的历史，连南瑶族地区，解放以来不但不缴公粮，而且每年国家要从外地调入大批粮食来供应和救济，可是由于一九五八年粮食生产大跃进，除了超额完成公购粮任务外，粮食自给有余，现在各公社都可以吃饱吃好，饥饿的日子一去不复返了。与粮食生产大跃进的同时，经济作物也获得非常显著的成绩，黎族苗族自治州自一九五三年至一九五八年，共种植长期经济作物八十三万多亩。至于畜牧业、水产业、农林业等方面，也同样飞速的发展。
    我们的祖国原来是“一穷二白”，在我们少数民族地区又可说是“更穷更白”，在过去的长远历史里，不但没有大工厂，而且连最简陋的手工业都少有或没有。几年来，我们地区的工业也随着农业的发展，特别是一九五八年贯彻了全党全民办工业，乡社办工业、和洋土并举的方针后，各种工业象雨后春笋般地发展起来。海南黎族苗族自治州一九五二年仅有简单的加工厂十二间，一九五八年增加到一千八百二十间，增加一百倍以上。一九五八年工业总产值达到七千六百七十三万元，比一九五二年增加三十倍以上。连南瑶族自治县一九五八年一年内就办起大小工厂四十七间，从此我们民族地区结束了没有钢铁工业的历史。
    解放以前，由于贫困和受压迫造成民族地区的文化教育事业非常落后，一所比较像样子的小学也没有，广大农村中，很难找到一个读书的人。解放后，党和政府非常关心少数民族人民的文化教育事业，大力兴办了许多学校。一九五八年黎族苗族自治州小学达到七百九十间，比一九五二年增加了百分之七十四，学生九万四千七百人，比一九五二年增加百分之九十一，中学八十四间，比一九五二年增加二十六倍，学生近一万人，比一九五二年增加四倍多。另外还有师专一间，红专学校三间，学生一千多人。目前全州平均每七人中有一个学生。连南县一九五八年小学达到一百四十三间，比一九五二年增长百分之一百二十；小学生一万一千六百人，比一九五二年增长百分之一百一十；中学五间，比一九五二年增长百分之八十，中学生比一九五二年增长二倍多。随着文教事业的发展及人民政治觉悟的提高，随着人民物质生活的改善，广大群众迫切要求成为有文化的劳动者，扫盲运动取得极大成绩，约有百分之六十以上的青年脱离了文盲的状态。随着教育事业的飞跃发展，文化事业也迅速发展起来，现在到处都建立起文化馆，图书馆，新华书店，报社，电影队及其他各种文艺组织。
    多少世纪以来，我们黎、苗、瑶族人民由于政治上受压迫，经济上受剥削，生活上贫病交迫，既缺乏科学知识，根本上不可能讲究什么卫生。人们生了病，就杀牛杀猪，求神拜鬼，以神鬼为医生，结果只是家破人亡。解放后，在党和政府大力帮助下，派去大批医务人员，建立大批医疗机构，展开了群众性的讲卫生除四害运动，人民的疾病大大减少，死亡率大大下降，海南黎族苗族自治州的陵水、保亭两县于一九五八年九月间已基本上实现“无疟县”。
    上述事实有力的说明了广东各个少数民族地区社会主义建设事业的发展，正以“一天等于二十年”的速度向前跃进，我们相信黎族苗族瑶族人民一定能够和全国各族人民一起沿着社会主义的道路，为建成一个具有现代工业、现代农业和现代文化科学的繁荣富强的伟大社会主义祖国而共同奋斗，同时跻于先进民族的行列，使黎族苗族瑶族成为社会主义的先进民族。
    黎、苗、瑶等族人民在党中央和中央人民政府的正确领导下，在各兄弟民族特别是汉族人民的积极帮助下，胜利的完成了民主改革和社会主义改造的任务，解放了社会生产力，提高了人民群众的政治觉悟，特别在党的鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义总路线的照耀和鼓舞下，人人意气风发，斗志昂扬，发挥了敢想、敢干、敢说的共产主义风格，因此，在建设社会主义事业方面能够和汉族地区同样的跃进。因此，根据本民族的切身体验，我们体会到西藏地区必须在祖国统一领导下实现民族区域自治，逐步进行民主改革和社会主义改造，只有如此才能解放社会生产力，提高人民的阶级觉悟，才能加强民族团结，维护祖国统一，才能使西藏人民和全国各族人民一起沿着共同繁荣富裕的社会主义道路奋勇前进。
