Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, May 5th - The fourth 10,000-kilowatt generator unit of the Meishan Hydropower Station in Anhui Province, a key project of the Huai River Harnessing Project, officially began generating electricity on May 1st. With this, the Meishan Hydropower Station has been fully and successfully completed and put into production.

The power station includes four hydro-turbine generator units with a total generating capacity of 40,000 kilowatts. The electricity it generates is continuously transmitted to the central Anhui region through high-voltage transmission lines, supplying production enterprises such as steel, iron, and coal.

The Meishan Hydropower Station is built inside the towering arch dam of the Meishan Reservoir and officially started construction in December 1957. During the construction process, the vast number of workers put forward the fighting slogan of "Making electricity cross a thousand mountains and letting river water irrigate ten thousand acres of fields," launched the "all-rounder" movement, and independently found materials to manufacture more than one hundred kinds of construction tools and power equipment parts, overcoming the difficulties of insufficient technical strength and certain equipment, which repeatedly advanced the construction schedule of the hydropower station. The construction and installation speed of the four generator units was faster than the previous one: the first unit generated electricity 105 days ahead of schedule, the second unit generated electricity 150 days ahead of schedule, the third unit generated electricity 240 days ahead of schedule, and the construction and installation speed of the fourth unit far exceeded the previous three.

Currently, the workers of the Meishan Hydropower Station are working hard to tap the potential of the equipment and are determined to overfulfill this year's plan to generate 120 million kilowatt-hours of electricity.

　　叫电流穿过千重山　让河水灌溉万顷田
    梅山水电站全部投入生产
    新华社合肥5日电　治淮工程之一——安徽省梅山水电站第四台一万瓩发电机组已于5月1日正式开始发电。至此，梅山水电站就全部胜利建成和投入生产。
    这个电站包括四台总发电能力为四万瓩的水轮发电机组，它发出的电流，通过高压输电线源源输送到安徽中部地区，供给钢、铁、煤炭等生产企业。
    梅山水电站建设在梅山水库巍峨的连拱坝里，是1957年12月正式动工的。在建设过程中，广大职工提出“让电流穿过千重山，叫河水灌溉万顷田”的战斗口号，开展“多面手”运动，自找材料制造出一百多种施工工具和发电设备部件，克服了技术力量和某些设备不足的困难，使水电站的建设期限一再提前。四个发电机组的建筑安装速度一台比一台快：第一组比计划提前一百零五天发电，第二组提前一百五十天发电，第三组提前二百四十天发电，第四组的建筑安装速度，又远远超过了前三组。
    现在，梅山水电站职工正在努力挖掘设备潜力，决心超额完成今年发电一亿二千万度的计划。
