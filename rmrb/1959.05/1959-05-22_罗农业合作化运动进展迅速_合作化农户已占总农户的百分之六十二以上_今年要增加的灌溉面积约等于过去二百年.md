Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, 21st -- This reporter reports: Romania is smoothly realizing the task put forward by the Workers' Party at the Second Congress in 1955 to make the socialist component in the national agriculture occupy an overwhelming advantage by 1960. Since the beginning of this year, the agricultural cooperativization movement, which has been carried out enthusiastically throughout the country, has gained new and rapid development.

This spring, more than 390,000 Romanian farm households and more than 910,000 hectares of cultivated land joined collective farms or mutual aid teams. As of April 1, the total number of farm households that have joined collective farms or mutual aid teams nationwide has reached more than 2.24 million, accounting for 62.3% of the total number of farm households in the country, an increase from 42% in 1957. The cultivated land owned by agricultural cooperative organizations has reached more than 5.3 million hectares, and together with the cultivated land of state-owned farms, the proportion of cultivated land occupied by the socialist sector in agriculture in the country's total cultivated land area has increased from 48% in 1957 to more than 63%.

At present, Timisoara, Galati, and Bucharest regions are moving towards full cooperativization. Although the cooperativization movement continues to advance vigorously during the spring busy season, two counties achieved full cooperativization in April.

The rapid development of Romania's agricultural cooperativization movement is primarily due to the Party's implementation of the policy of consolidating collective farms organizationally and economically, enabling many collective farms to demonstrate superiority in production. In addition, Party organizations at all levels have paid special attention to consolidating and developing mutual aid teams, a primary form of cooperation that is easily accepted by farmers. Finally, the Party's propaganda work has played a decisive role in the agricultural cooperativization movement. All localities have organized a large number of propagandists to carry out propaganda to farmers, using concrete examples to convince individual farmers of the superiority of cooperativization.

With the development of the agricultural cooperativization movement, the enthusiasm of working peasants has been further heightened, and the technical and material foundations of agriculture have been further strengthened, thus greatly promoting agricultural production. Only 54.5% of the spring-sown land last year was plowed in the autumn of 1957, while most of this year's spring-sown land has been plowed last autumn, and most of it was deeply plowed. This year's spring plowing work is also progressing quickly, and the degree of mechanization has increased by 20% compared with last year. The amount of organic fertilizer applied by collective farms and mutual aid teams is generally more than last year.

This year, Romania's water conservancy and soil improvement projects are even larger in scale, and the state has allocated 350 million lei for these projects. This work will be carried out on 373,000 hectares of land this year. According to the plan proposed by the Council of Ministers, the irrigated area will be increased by 78,000 hectares this year, but the farmers have proposed to increase it by more than 90,000 hectares, while the irrigated area managed in the past two hundred years was only 100,000 hectares. Most of this year's water conservancy projects are carried out by farmers' voluntary labor and are expected to be completed by the end of May or the beginning of June.

Xinhua News Agency, Bucharest, 21st -- Romanian state-owned farms are actively implementing the resolution on strengthening the Party's leadership and supervision of state-owned farms and improving the economic work of state-owned farms, which was made by the Central Committee of the Workers' Party and the Council of Ministers at the end of March this year. The progress of this work shows that the grain and animal husbandry production of state-owned farms will be rapidly developed this year.

Compared with 1958, the total wheat production of Romanian state-owned farms will increase by 48% this year, and corn will increase by 101%. Its production cost will also be greatly reduced. The livestock and poultry breeding industry of state-owned farms will also be greatly developed. This year, state-owned farms will supply 98 million liters of milk, 800,000 pigs, and 1.1 million poultry. In the first quarter of this year, the number of dairy cows has increased by 36% compared with the same period last year, pigs have increased by 24%, and sheep have increased by 21%.

    罗农业合作化运动进展迅速
    合作化农户已占总农户的百分之六十二以上
    今年要增加的灌溉面积约等于过去二百年
    新华社布加勒斯特21日电　本社记者报道：罗马尼亚正在顺利地实现工人党在1955年第二次代表大会上提出的到1960年使全国农业中的社会主义成分占压倒优势的任务。今年以来，在全国范围内热烈进行的农业合作化运动又获得了新的迅速发展。
    今春，罗马尼亚的三十九万多农户和九十一万多公顷耕地加入了集体农庄或共耕社。到4月1日为止，全国已经加入集体农庄或共耕社的农户共有二百二十四万多户，在全国总农户中所占的比重已经由1957年的42％增加到现在的62.3％。农业合作组织拥有的耕地已达五百三十万多公顷，加上国营农场的耕地，农业中的社会主义部分所占有的耕地在全国耕地面积中的比重已经由1957年的48％增加到现在的63％以上。
    目前，在底密索拉州、加拉奇州和布加勒斯特州正在朝着全面合作化前进中。虽然在春忙时节，合作化运动仍然一个劲儿地前进，在4月份中就有两个县实现了全面合作化。
    罗马尼亚农业合作化运动所以能够迅速发展，首先是由于党贯彻了从组织上和经济上巩固集体农庄的政策，使许多集体农庄在生产上显示了优越性。此外，各地党组织还特别注意巩固和发展共耕社这种容易为农民接受的合作化初级形式。最后，党的宣传工作在农业合作化运动中起了决定性的作用，各地都曾组织了大批宣传员向农民进行宣传，利用具体事例使个体农民相信合作化的优越性。
    随着农业合作化运动的发展，劳动农民的积极性更加高涨，农业的技术物质基础也得到了进一步的加强，因而对农业生产起了很大的推动作用。去年的春播土地只有54.5％是在1957年秋季翻的，而今年的春播土地大多数都已在去年秋天翻好，并且绝大部分是深翻的。今年的春耕工作进行得也很快，而且机械化程度比去年提高了20％。集体农庄和共耕社施用有机肥料的数量一般都比去年多。
    今年罗马尼亚兴修水利和改良土壤的工程规模更为庞大，国家拨出了三亿五千万列伊作为这些工程的费用。今年将在三十七万三千公顷的土地上进行这一工作。按照部长会议提出的计划，今年将增加灌溉面积七万八千公顷，但是农民提出要增加九万多公顷，而过去两百年来所经营的灌溉面积也不过只有十万公顷。今年的水利工程大部分都是由农民义务劳动进行的，预计将在5月底或6月初完成。
    新华社布加勒斯特21日电　罗马尼亚国营农场正在积极贯彻工人党中央委员会和部长会议在今年3月底作出的关于加强国营农场的党的领导和监督，以及改善国营农场的经济工作的若干措施的决议。这一工作的进展情况表明，今年国营农场的谷物和畜牧业生产将得到迅速的发展。
    同1958年比较，今年罗马尼亚国营农场小麦总产量将增加48％，玉米将增加101％。其生产成本也将大大降低。国营农场的家畜家禽饲养业也将获得很大发展。今年国营农场将供应九千八百万公升牛奶，八十万口猪，一百一十万只家禽。在今年第一季度中，乳牛头数就已经比去年同一时期增加了36％，猪增加了24％，羊增加了21％。
