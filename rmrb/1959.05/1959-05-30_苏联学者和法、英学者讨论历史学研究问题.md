	Soviet Scholars and French and British Scholars Discuss Historical Research Problems

	According to the Soviet journal "Modern History and Contemporary History," a delegation of Soviet historians held two scientific conferences with French and British historians in Paris and London, respectively.

	The Soviet delegation to France, led by Academician F. Volgin, discussed many issues related to Soviet, French history, and Franco-Soviet relations with French historians. For example, Soviet scholars presented a report on agriculture in Russia during the feudal period, and French scholars presented a report on serfdom in the eleventh and twelfth centuries. Scholars from both countries also jointly studied and discussed issues such as medieval cities, the French bourgeois revolution of the eighteenth century, social movements in Russia before 1861, the industrial revolution, and the role and crisis of banks in the nineteenth century, presenting their own reports. There were heated debates at the meeting. For example, regarding the historiography of the French Revolution of the eighteenth century, Professor Reynaud of the University of Paris raised some questions that he considered very important. He believed that the French Revolution of the eighteenth century was linked to bourgeois revolutions, especially the American Revolution of the eighteenth century, and, based on the views of the French historian Godechot, put forward an ambiguous opinion: whether the French Revolution of the eighteenth century should be considered part of a certain "Atlantic Revolution." This question aroused great controversy. Soviet scholar A. Manfred said in his speech that there were differences of opinion between them. He said that, first of all, this difference of opinion started with the discussion of the anti-scientific concept of the "Atlantic Revolution," because there had never been such a revolution in history. Manfred refuted the direct or indirect negation of the anti-feudal nature of the French Revolution by some French historians, and he opposed the comparison between the Jacobins and the Republicans. Professor Reynaud agreed with the impropriety of the concept of "Atlantic Revolution," but he still argued about the anti-feudal nature of the French Revolution. Further exchange of views showed that there were also great differences in viewpoints and methods among French historians themselves. Professors Labrousse and Tabyer of the University of Paris were closer to the views of Soviet scholars. In the discussion of Franco-Russian relations at the end of the nineteenth century, there were differences of opinion between Manfred's report and Academician Renouvin of the Slavic Studies Institute of the University of Paris, as well as in later speeches. The former pointed out that among the many reasons that determined Franco-Russian rapprochement at the end of the nineteenth century, the common interests of the aggressive Triple Alliance, led by Germany, was the main reason. Although Academician Renouvin did not deny this on the surface, he attempted to put the "Eastern Question," certain Balkan issues, and Russo-Austrian contradictions in the primary position, and concealed and underestimated the contradictions between France and Germany and their role in Franco-Russian rapprochement. French scholar Grünewald also attempted to prove the role of the Eastern Question (Balkan issue) by the view that the beginning of the Great War of 1914-1918 seemed to have originated in Serbia. Soviet scholar F. Bofkin presented arguments to confirm the role of Franco-German contradictions in Franco-Russian relations.

	The Soviet historians delegation led by A. Guber held a five-day meeting with the British historians delegation in London. The following reports were heard and discussed at the meeting: "Recent Developments in Soviet and British Archaeology" (Soviet, British); "The Origin of the Russian Greek Orthodox Church" (Soviet); "The Status of the Church in the Early Middle Ages" (British); "The Nature of Feudalism in Medieval England" (British); "Social History of England in the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries" (Soviet, British); "German Policy of Russia and England in 1848-1871" (Soviet, British); "Historical Materials, Methods, and Compilation Plans for the History of World War II in the Soviet Union" (Soviet); "Methods and Historical Materials for Compiling the History of World War II" (British).

    苏联学者和法、英学者讨论历史学研究问题
    根据苏联“近代史和现代史”杂志报道，苏联历史学家代表团和法国历史学家、英国历史学家，分别在巴黎和伦敦举行了两次科学会议。
    由佛·沃尔金院士率领的苏联访法代表团和法国历史学家讨论了许多有关苏联、法国历史和法苏关系的问题。例如，苏联学者作了俄国封建时期农业的报告，法国学者作了十一、二世纪的农奴制的报告。两国学者都就中世纪城市问题、十八世纪法国资产阶级革命问题、1861年前俄罗斯社会运动问题，以及工业革命问题和十九世纪银行的作用与危机问题，提出了自己的报告共同进行了研究讨论。会上有热烈的争论。例如，关于十八世纪法国革命史编纂学问题，巴黎大学教授累纳尔提出了一些他认为很重要的问题；他认为十八世纪的法国革命，与资产阶级革命，特别是十八世纪的美国革命有联系，他并以法国历史学家戈多萧的见解为依据，提出了一个模棱两可的意见：是否应该认为十八世纪的法国革命是某种“大西洋革命”的一部分。这个问题就引起了很大的争论。苏联学者阿·曼夫雷特在发言中说，他们之间有着分歧的看法。他说，首先这种不同意见是由讨论反科学的概念“大西洋革命”开始的，因为历史上并没有过这种革命。曼夫雷特反驳某些法国历史学家的直接或间接否定法国革命的反封建制的性质，他并且反对将雅可宾党和共和党人加以对比。累纳尔教授同意“大西洋革命”这个概念的不妥，但他对法国革命的反封建性质问题仍作了争辩。在进一步交换意见中表明了法国历史学家本身在观点、方法上也存在着很大分歧。巴黎大学的拉布罗斯和塔比叶教授比较接近苏联学者的观点。在讨论十九世纪末法俄关系问题时，曼夫雷特和巴黎大学斯拉夫学研究所勒诺文院士的报告和后来的发言都有着分歧意见。前者指出，十九世纪末决定法俄接近的许多原因中，由德国主持缔结的侵略性的三国同盟的共同利害是主要原因。勒诺文院士表面上虽然不否认这一点，但他企图把“东方问题”、某些巴尔干问题和俄奥矛盾提到首要地位，并掩饰与低估法德间的矛盾及其对法俄接近的作用。法国学者格吕沃尔德并企图以1914—1918年大战的开始似乎起因于塞尔维亚的观点来证明东方问题（巴尔干问题）的作用。苏联学者佛·波浮金提出论据证实法德矛盾对法俄间关系所起的作用。
    由阿·古贝尔率领的苏联历史学家代表团，和英国历史学家代表团在伦敦举行五天会议，在会上听取和讨论了下列报告：“苏联和英国考古学近况”（苏、英）；“俄罗斯希腊正教教会的起源”（苏）；“中世纪初期教会地位（英）；“中世纪英国封建制度的性质”（英）；“十六—十七世纪英国社会史”（苏、英）；“1848—1871年俄罗斯与英国的联德政策”（苏、英）；“苏联第二次世界大战史的史料、方法与编写计划”（苏）；“编写第二次世界大战战争史的方法与史料”（英）。
