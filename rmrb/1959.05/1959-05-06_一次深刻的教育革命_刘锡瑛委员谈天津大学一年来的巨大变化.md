A Profound Educational Revolution
Committee Member Liu Xiying Discusses the Enormous Changes at Tianjin University Over the Past Year

Chairman, fellow committee members:

I fully endorse Premier Zhou's Government Work Report and the reports by Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, and I fully agree with the work report of the Standing Committee of the Second National Committee of the CPPCC presented by Vice Chairman Li Weihan.

1958 was a year of comprehensive great leap forward in China's industry and agriculture, and all undertakings developed rapidly. Under the brilliant illumination of the General Line and driven by the nationwide leap forward, our Tianjin University, thanks to the correct leadership of the Central, Provincial, and Municipal Party Committees and the University Party Committee, and the active efforts of the vast number of teachers, students, and staff, also achieved great success in implementing the Party's educational policy of "education serving proletarian politics, and education combined with productive labor." I would like to take this opportunity to give you a brief report based on my personal experiences.

University Students Able to Use Both Pen and Weapon, Political and Professional Skills Improved

Over the past year, under the leadership of the Party, Tianjin University vigorously implemented the Party's educational policy and carried out a series of tasks. The main achievements are as follows:

1.  The labor viewpoint has been basically established, and the sanctity of labor is no longer a mere slogan but is reflected in actual life. Through participating in various labor practices over the past year, the majority of students have begun to transform their thinking of looking down on labor, and they no longer dislike or fear labor. In the past, they would wear white gloves and half-heeled shoes to labor, fearing that labor would darken their skin; now, they are able to do the most arduous work, take on heavy tasks, work selflessly, and take pride in it. They are not afraid of getting dirty or tired in labor, showing soaring enthusiasm; whether in the transformation of the Hai River, steelmaking, or large-scale factory construction, they fought hard day and night, never complained, and even those who were sick insisted on carrying seventy bricks with others, unwilling to tell others about their illness. Someone burned their leg while making steel, but still persisted in working for fifty hours. It was in this spirit of love for labor that our university contributed more than 120,000 workdays to the Hai River project, contributing our strength to this great struggle to transform nature by separating clear and turbid water and separating fresh and salt water; in the nationwide steelmaking movement, we overfulfilled the task of producing 380 tons of steel; and in large-scale factory construction, we built 120 factories from scratch. Labor has also transformed thinking. Participating in rural labor has changed their feelings about manure, and those who worked in factories deeply realized that "in the past, we thought that physical labor was simple and crude, and that we would learn it without studying, but in practice, we could not swing the hammer or make the model well; the stupid person was precisely ourselves, not the working people."

2.  Breaking superstitions, liberating thinking, and establishing a communist style of daring to think, speak, and act. Through the study and publicity of the Party's General Line, the struggle between the two roads of teaching and scientific research, and the nationwide efforts to catch up with and surpass the UK and the US, the enthusiasm of the vast number of teachers and students was inspired and encouraged, breaking down inferiority, breaking superstitions, liberating thinking, and promoting creativity. In the movement of building factories on a large scale and launching a technical revolution, people's enthusiasm soared, especially the enthusiasm of young students, which was even more inspiring. The young students showed a style of daring to think, speak, and act, not fearing difficulties, dirt, or fatigue. At night, the various experimental factory rooms were brightly lit, working around the clock, and the utilization rate of machines, instruments, and experimental factory rooms reached the highest point. People who worked selflessly and fought hard day and night were everywhere. In just two or three months, 826 scientific research projects were completed, some of which have reached a relatively high level, such as the cyclotron, electronic analog computer, AC calculating platform, and magnetic tape recording and playback program-controlled machine tool. Things that were thought to be impossible in the past have now been made. This has initially consolidated the results of ideological struggle, broken down superstitions about scientific research, liberated thinking, and laid an ideological foundation for the implementation of the policy of combining education with productive labor.

3.  Improvement of educational quality:

    First, it greatly improved the students' political and ideological awareness. Through productive labor, students' views on labor, the masses, class, and collectivism have all been strengthened to varying degrees. They have learned the excellent qualities of the working people, further recognized the necessity of transforming intellectuals, effectively eliminated arrogance and squeamishness, and established a style of hard work and plain living.

    Second, it improved the quality of professional studies. This is reflected in:

    (1) Consolidating theoretical knowledge and increasing perceptual knowledge. Students in the Civil Engineering Department personally built a four-story building, learning many things that could not be learned from books. They were able to integrate and understand what they had learned in the past, and it was easier to accept what had not yet been taught after they had perceptual knowledge first. Before participating in transformer production, third-year students in the Electrical Engineering Department had also learned transformer theory, but their understanding was not deep enough. After making transformers with their own hands, the students reflected that they truly understood transformers. Students majoring in internal combustion engines had learned about the properties and composition of cast iron and ductile iron when studying metalworking, but the students became more and more confused as they memorized them. When they encountered castings, they could not distinguish between gray cast iron and white cast iron. Through manufacturing cars, they could not only identify what kind of iron it was, but also remember the properties and composition of various types of iron very clearly. Students reflected that they learned quickly and remembered firmly through productive labor.

    (2) Training students' practical operation skills. After working in the school factory for half a year, most of the second- and third-year students majoring in mechanical manufacturing reached the level of a third-grade worker in one type of work, and a few even reached the level of a fourth-grade worker. After students in the Civil Engineering Department participated in nine weeks of labor on the construction site, the construction site reflected that the vast majority of students reached the level of a third-grade worker. At the beginning, students in the Textile Department weaved more defective products, but after several months of labor, many students could weave first-class fabrics. Before liberation, it was common for university students who studied machines to be afraid of touching machines, and those who studied motors to be afraid of starting motors. Now, university students are able to use both pen and weapon.

    (3) Through productive labor and scientific research, teachers increased their understanding of practical production knowledge and the latest science and technology, which naturally improved the quality of teaching.

    Third, through productive labor and physical exercise, students' health has been enhanced. Appetite and weight have generally increased. The number of patients with insomnia and neurasthenia has been greatly reduced. A healthy and lively new atmosphere has begun to appear.

4.  On the basis of the 120 factories established in the movement of building factories on a large scale, after adjustment and merger, a total of 23 factories were established. These factories are closely integrated with the major and provide a production base for further implementing the Party's educational policy in the future. Under the guidance of the Party's educational policy and under the leadership of the Party, a teaching plan has been formulated with a combination of teachers and students, which basically embodies the close integration of teaching, scientific research, and production, and implements the principle of combining theory with practice; it emphasizes both basic theory courses and ensures the necessary professional knowledge. We are currently revising the teaching syllabus and compiling teaching materials. We plan to make necessary revisions to the teaching plan after the teaching syllabus is revised.

Some Experiences

The above achievements fully demonstrate that implementing the Party's educational policy has brought about tremendous changes in the face of the school. This is a fundamental reform, a profound educational revolution. The reason why these achievements can be made, I have the following points of experience.

First of all, the Party's leadership of school work is not only leadership in political and ideological aspects, but also leadership in teaching and scientific research has been strengthened. Over the past year, under the correct leadership of the Party, in the past movements, the class stand, political views and ideological methods of the bourgeoisie, as well as the bourgeois educational thoughts and academic views reflected in teaching and scientific research, have been thoroughly exposed and criticized. The ideological influence of the bourgeoisie is shrinking and weakening. The ideological position of Marxism-Leninism is expanding and consolidating. The political atmosphere of the school is rising. This has created favorable conditions for the implementation of the Party's educational policy.

Secondly, the school work, especially the teaching and scientific research work, has implemented the mass line. The victories of political and ideological struggles and various movements over the past year have always been achieved by implementing the mass line, boldly mobilizing the masses, and relying on the masses to actively and consciously implement it. In this struggle, the vast number of masses have personally experienced the superiority of the mass line working method, and at the same time, they have learned the working skills of taking the mass line. This is an extremely favorable condition for promoting the school's future work.

Thirdly, the combination of education and productive labor is the only shortcut to achieve both redness and expertise, and it is the most effective way to transform old intellectuals and cultivate new working-class intellectuals. Through the practice of the past year, we can realize that after participating in productive labor, people's consciousness will slowly change. He will gradually truly understand that only through labor, only with the hands of labor, can wasteland be turned into fertile land; only through collective labor, relying on the strength of the masses, can the Hai River separate clear and turbid water and separate fresh and salt water. If one does not participate in productive labor, the so-called labor viewpoint and collective concept are just abstract concepts to him. Participating in productive labor will make a person take root in the working people, and naturally have a mass viewpoint. Participating in productive labor can overcome the dogmatic learning method of theory being divorced from reality. Without practice, there is no perceptual knowledge, and the true understanding of the law cannot be discussed. The combination of education and productive labor embodies the truth of practice—knowledge—re-practice, which conforms to the law of knowledge development. Only when practice is combined with theory can the knowledge gained be complete rather than one-sided.

Six Suggestions for Continuing to Improve Teaching Quality

Although great achievements have been made in the past year, the implementation of the Party's educational policy can only be regarded as a beginning. Premier Zhou pointed out in the Government Work Report: "In the past year, schools at all levels have developed greatly, and now it is necessary to carry out the work of rectification, consolidation, and improvement on the basis of this great development. In full-time regular schools at all levels, raising the quality of teaching should be taken as a regular and basic task, and a greater effort should be concentrated on running a number of key schools well, so as to train specialized talents of higher quality for the country and rapidly promote the improvement of our country's scientific and cultural level." According to the spirit of the Premier's instructions and the specific situation of our school, our future work should be: continue to deeply and comprehensively implement the Party's educational policy, take teaching as the center, and closely combine teaching, scientific research, and productive labor. The central issue is the issue of improving teaching quality. How to improve teaching quality, the following points are initially thought of:

1.  Give full play to the role of old teachers and actively train young teachers; necessary measures must be taken to improve teachers in terms of ideological awareness, theoretical level, and practical production experience. Only good teachers can train good students.

2.  Strict requirements for students. In regular teaching work, in all teaching links, as well as in examinations, study discipline, etc., strict requirements for students, give full play to the leading role of teachers under the leadership of the Party, so that teachers dare to strictly demand students and dare to educate students. Only strict requirements can cultivate qualified cadres.

3.  Conscientiously implement the spirit of strengthening basic theory courses. Correctly arrange the proportion of basic theory courses and professional courses, so that students have a solid theoretical foundation and master a certain amount of professional knowledge. Vigorously strengthen the teaching work of basic theory courses.

4.  In accordance with the principle of running schools with diligence and thrift, gradually enrich the necessary teaching equipment.

5.  Vigorously strengthen Marxism-Leninism ideological education. Only by continuously strengthening Marxism-Leninism ideological education can we cultivate construction talents who are both red and expert.

6.  Ensuring that the key to improving teaching quality lies in the leadership of the Party. In the future, it is necessary to continue to strengthen the leadership of the Party, resolutely implement the system of responsibility of the school affairs committee under the leadership of the Party committee, and improve the work of the school affairs committee. It is necessary to strengthen the leadership of the Party and give play to the role of administrative organizations.

　　一次深刻的教育革命
    刘锡瑛委员谈天津大学一年来的巨大变化主席、各位委员：
    我完全拥护周总理的政府工作报告和李富春、李先念两位副总理的报告，完全同意李维汉副主席所作的政协第二届全国委员会常务委员会的工作报告。
    一九五八年是我国工农业全面大跃进的一年，各方面的事业都有了飞速的发展。我们天津大学在总路线的光辉照耀和全国跃进形势的带动下，由于中央及省市委和学校党委的正确领导，和广大师生员工的积极努力，在贯彻执行党的“教育为无产阶级政治服务，教育与生产劳动相结合”的教育方针方面，也获得很大的成绩。我想借这个机会根据个人的体会向大家作一个简单汇报。
    大学生能文又能武  政治业务双双提高
    一年来天津大学在党的领导下，大力贯彻了党的教育方针，进行了一系列的工作，其主要成绩有以下几点：
    一、劳动观点已基本上树立起来了，劳动神圣已经不是一个口头辞句而是从实际生活中体现出来了。通过一年来参加各种劳动实践，广大同学开始转变了轻视劳动的思想，对劳动不再是厌恶和畏惧。过去是带着白手套、穿着半高跟鞋去劳动的，怕劳动晒黑了皮肤；现在他们是能干最艰苦的活，挑重活干，忘我劳动并引为自豪。在劳动中不怕脏，不怕累，表现了冲天的干劲；无论在改造海河、炼钢、大办工厂等各项运动中，昼夜苦战，从不叫苦，有病的仍坚持与别人抬七十块砖，不愿把病告诉别人。有人在炼钢中烫伤腿，仍继续坚持五十小时劳动。就是在这种热爱劳动的精神下，我校在海河工程中共出十二万多个劳动日，为清浊分流咸淡分家这一伟大改造自然的斗争中贡献了我们的力量；在全民炼钢运动中，超额完成了三百八十吨钢的任务；在大办工厂中，白手起家修建了一百二十个工厂。劳动还改造了思想。参加农村劳动对粪有了感情的变化，在工厂劳动的也深刻体会到“过去认为体力劳动简单、粗笨，不学就会，但在实践中是铁锤抡不动，模型作不好，笨人正是自己，而不是劳动人民。”
    二、破除迷信，解放思想，树立了敢想敢说敢干的共产主义风格。通过党的总路线宣传学习、教学科研两条道路斗争、全国人民力争上游，超英赶美，启发和鼓舞了广大师生的积极性，打破了自卑，破除迷信，解放了思想，发扬了创造性。在大办工厂，大闹技术革命运动中，人们的干劲冲天，特别是青年学生的干劲更使人振奋。青年学生们表现了敢想敢说敢干、不怕困难、不畏脏累的风格，入夜各试验厂室一片灯光、通宵达旦，机器、仪器试验厂室的使用率达到最高点。忘我劳动，夜以继日苦战的人，比比皆是。短短两三个月即完成科学研究八百二十六项，其中有些项目已经达到较高的水平，如回旋加速器、电子模拟计算机、交流计算台、磁带录返式程序控制机床等。过去认为不能作的现在作出来了。这就初步巩固了思想斗争的成果，破除了对科学研究的迷信，解放了思想，为教育与生产劳动相结合方针的贯彻打下了思想基础。
    三、教育质量的提高：
    第一、大大提高了学生的政治思想觉悟。通过生产劳动，学生的劳动观点、群众观点、阶级观点和集体观点均有不同程度的增强。学习了劳动人民的优秀品质，进一步认清了知识分子改造的必要性，有力地打掉了骄气和娇气，树立了艰苦朴素的生活作风。
    第二、提高了业务学习的质量。表现在：
    （一）巩固了理论知识增加了感性知识。土木系同学亲手盖起了四层大楼，学到了许多书本上学不到的东西，对过去讲过的东西更能融化贯通了，对尚未讲过的东西，先有了感性知识再讲也容易接受了。电力系三年级学生参加变压器生产以前，虽然也学过变压器理论，但了解得不够深透，亲手做过变压器以后，学生反映是真正懂得变压器了。内燃机专业的学生，过去学金属工学时讲过铸铁、球墨铸铁的性质成分，学生们越记越混，遇到铸件，也分不清是灰口铁还是白口铁，通过制造小汽车，不但能鉴别是什么铁，而且能够把各种铁的性质成分记得很清楚。学生反映，通过生产劳动，学得快，记得牢。
    （二）锻炼了学生的实际操作能力。机械制造专业二、三年级的学生在学校工厂劳动半年以后，大部分学生在一个工种上达到了三级工水平，少数甚至达到了四级工水平。土木系学生在工地参加九周劳动以后，据工地反映，绝大部分学生达到三级工。纺织系学生，一开始织的废品较多，经过几个月的劳动，不少学生可以织一等品的布。解放前的大学生，学机器的不敢摸机器，学电机的不敢开电机的情况是常见的，现在的大学生是能文又能武。
    （三）通过生产劳动及科学研究，教师对生产实际知识及最新科学技术增加了了解，自然而然地提高了教学质量。
    第三、通过生产劳动和体育锻炼，增强了学生的身体健康。食量和体重普遍增加了。失眠和精神衰弱的患者大大地减少了。开始出现了健康活泼的新气象。
    四、在大办工厂的运动中建立起来的一百二十个工厂的基础上，经过调整和合并，共办了二十三个工厂。这些工厂都是密切结合专业，为今后进一步贯彻党的教育方针，提供了生产基地。在党的教育方针的指导下，在党的领导下，以教师和学生相结合的方法制定了基本上体现教学、科学研究、生产三者紧密结合的，贯彻理论联系实际原则的；既强调基础理论课，又保证必要的专业知识的教学计划。目前正在修订教学大纲和编写教材。我们准备在教学大纲修订完毕后，再反过来对教学计划作必要的修改。
    几点体会
    以上的成绩充分说明贯彻党的教育方针，使得学校的面貌发生了巨大的变化。这是一个根本性质的改革，是一次深刻的教育革命。所以能取得这些成绩，我有以下几点体会。
    首先，党对学校工作的领导，不仅在政治思想方面的领导，同时对教学和科学研究的领导也加强了。一年来，在党的正确领导下，在历次运动中，资产阶级的阶级立场，政治观点和思想方法，以及反映在教学和科学研究方面的资产阶级的教育思想、学术观点受到了彻底地揭露和批判。资产阶级的思想影响日益缩小、减弱。马列主义的思想阵地日益扩大、巩固。学校的政治空气上涨。这就为贯彻党的教育方针创造了良好的条件。
    其次，学校工作，特别是教学和科学研究工作贯彻了群众路线。一年来政治思想斗争和各项运动的胜利，始终都是贯彻群众路线，放手发动群众，依靠群众积极自觉的执行才获得的。广大群众在这次斗争中，都亲身体验到群众路线工作方法的优越性，同时也学会了走群众路线的工作本领，这就是学校今后工作的推动，极为有利的良好条件。
    再次，教育与生产劳动相结合是达到又红又专的唯一捷径，是改造旧知识分子和培养新的工人阶级知识分子的最有效的办法。通过一年来的实践，我们可以体会到：参加了劳动生产后，人的意识是会慢慢变化的。他会逐渐真正懂得只有通过劳动，只有用劳动的双手，才能把荒地开成良田；只有通过集体劳动，靠群众的力量，才能使海河清浊分流咸淡分家。如果不参加生产劳动，所谓劳动观点、集体观念对他不过是一个抽象概念而已。参加生产劳动就会使一个人把根扎在劳动人民中，自然而然地有了群众观点。参加了生产劳动，才能克服理论脱离实际的教条主义的学习方法。缺乏实践，就没有感性知识，对于规律的真正认识是谈不上的。教育与生产劳动结合体现了实践——认识——再实践的真理，合乎认识发展的规律。只有实践与理论结合起来，所获得的知识才是完全的，而非片面的知识。
    继续提高教学质量的六点建议
    过去一年中虽然取得了巨大的成绩，但是贯彻党的教育方针还只能算是个开始。周总理在政府工作报告中指出：“去年一年，各级学校都有了很大的发展，现在需要在这个大发展的基础上进行整顿、巩固和提高的工作。在各级全日制的正规学校中，应当把提高教学质量作为一个经常的基本任务，而且应当首先集中较大力量办好一批重点学校，以便为国家培养更高质量的专门人才，迅速促进我国科学文化水平的提高。”根据总理指示的精神和我校的具体情况，我们今后的工作应该是：继续深入全面地贯彻党的教育方针，以教学为中心，把教学、科研和生产劳动紧密结合起来。中心的问题是提高教学质量问题。如何提高教学质量，初步想到的有以下几点：
    一、充分发挥老教师的作用，积极培养青年师资；必需认真采取措施，在思想觉悟、理论水平、生产实际经验等方面提高师资，只有好的教师，才能培养出好的学生。
    二、严格对学生的要求。在经常教学工作中，在各个教学环节中以及考试考查、学习纪律等方面，严格对学生的要求，在党的领导下充分发挥教师的主导作用，使教师敢于严格要求学生，敢于教育学生，只有严格要求，才能培养出合乎质量的干部。
    三、认真贯彻加强基础理论课的精神。正确地安排基础理论课与专业课的比例，既要使学生有雄厚的理论基础，又要使学生掌握一定的专业知识。大力加强基础理论课的教学工作。
    四、根据勤俭办学的原则，逐步充实必要的教学设备。
    五、大力加强马列主义思想教育。只有不断地加强马列主义思想教育，才能培养出又红又专的建设人才。
    六、保证提高教学质量的关键在于党的领导，今后必需继续加强党的领导，坚决贯彻党委领导下的校务委员会负责制，健全校务委员会的工作。既要加强党的领导，又要发挥行政组织的作用。
