Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, 11th - Our correspondent Wan Guang reports: After the foreign ministers of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France reached an agreement on the participation of the two Germanys in the Geneva East-West conference, today, at nearly six o'clock local time, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the German Democratic Republic, Bolz, along with the four foreign ministers, arrived one after another by car at the Foreign Ministers' Conference Hall, specially arranged in the old League of Nations building. Some Western journalists gathered at the entrance of the conference hall watched the cars arrive, constantly craning their necks and asking each other, "Where is Brentano?" However, in the end, people only saw the West German ambassador to the United States, Grewe, enter the venue, while the West German Foreign Minister, Brentano, who claimed to have come to Geneva as the head of the West German government delegation, never showed up. At the opening of the conference, one of the six seats for the West German representatives remained empty.

This peculiar scene fully demonstrates that the West German Adenauer government is absolutely unwilling to speak on behalf of the German people, and that such a government is currently in a very embarrassing situation. The central topics of the Geneva conference are the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany and the issue of ending the occupation regime in West Berlin, which must be attended by representatives of both Germanys. This is a major event that safeguards the national interests of the German people. The German Democratic Republic has always demanded this, and the Soviet Union has always insisted on this legitimate proposal. However, the West German government is fundamentally unwilling to participate in the conference. Originally, Brentano was not prepared to come to Geneva. Only after the German Democratic Republic announced that its Foreign Minister Bolz would lead a delegation to attend the conference, did Brentano have to change his original intention. Yesterday, when this senior West German official arrived in Geneva, he took an ordinary train, mingled with ordinary passengers out of the Geneva station, and the Western reporters waiting on the platform had a hard time recognizing him.

Newspapers reported that after being forced to lead the West German government delegation to Geneva, Brentano only wanted to act as a "consultant" to the Western delegations behind the scenes, and did not want to participate in the meeting. The West German government has also consistently supported the "unified Germany plan" orchestrated by the Western countries, led by the United States, which would make decisions without the participation of the German people. Adenauer and his ilk openly stated that they were most afraid of the occupying forces of the United States and other Western countries leaving. West German Defense Minister Strauss even said on the 8th, when defending West German atomic armament, that without it the United States could not "trust West Germany." All of this outlines what role West Germany, which is touted as "independent" and as "one of the four allies" in the Western world, is actually playing for the United States.

The West German ruling clique has so far refused to "recognize" the existence of the German Democratic Republic. It is said that Brentano's failure to attend the meeting today is also intended to "demonstrate" this point. However, representatives of the two Germanys have already sat face-to-face at the conference table with the four foreign ministers. Brentano is just a Western "Ah Q." The international prestige of the German Democratic Republic, which represents the will and future of the German people, is rising, while the fate of those who rely on foreign countries and violate the interests of the German people will only get worse and worse.

    西德外长在日内瓦的尴尬相
    既自称代表团长  又不敢出席会议
    日内瓦外长会议上的奇特景象
    新华社日内瓦11日电  本社记者万光报道：在苏、美、英、法四国外长达成了关于两个德国参加日内瓦东西方会议的协议以后，今天当地时间下午接近六点钟的时候，德意志民主共和国外交部长博尔茨同四国外长一道，先后乘汽车到达旧国联大厦里专门布置的外长会议厅。聚集在会议厅入场处的一些西方记者看着一辆辆汽车开到，不停地探头互问：“哪里是勃伦塔诺？”然而，到最后，人们还是只看到西德驻美国大使格雷韦进入会场，而那个西德外长、自称是以西德政府代表团团长头衔来到日内瓦的勃伦塔诺，却始终没有露面。在会议开幕时，西德六个代表的座席便空了一个。
    这个奇特的景象，充分表明了西德阿登纳政府绝不愿代表德国人讲话，而这样的政府目前的处境是十分尴尬的。日内瓦会议的中心议题是缔结对德和约和结束西柏林占领制度问题，必须有两个德国的代表参加。这是一件维护德国人民的民族利益的大事，德意志民主共和国一直是要求这一点的，苏联一直是坚持这个正当的建议的。但是，西德政府根本不愿意参加会议。原来，勃伦塔诺是并不准备来日内瓦的。只是在德意志民主共和国宣布它的外长博尔茨将率领代表团来出席会议后，勃伦塔诺才不得不改变初衷。昨天，这位西德高级官员来到日内瓦的时候，乘坐了一列普通火车，混在普通旅客里走出日内瓦车站，在月台上等着的西方记者好容易才把他认了出来。
    报纸报道，勃伦塔诺在被迫率领西德政府代表团来到日内瓦后，还只想在幕后当西方国家代表团的“顾问”，而不想参加会议。西德政府并且一直支持以美国为首的西方国家策划的不让德国人民参加而擅自包办决定的“统一德国方案”。阿登纳之流公开表示他们最害怕美国等西方国家占领军离开，西德国防部长施特劳斯8日为西德原子武装辩护时又甚至说，不如此美国便不能“信任西德”。所有这些，勾划出了在西方世界里号称“独立”、号称“四个盟国之一”的西德，实际上在当着美国的一个什么角色。
    西德统治集团迄今还拒绝“承认”德意志民主共和国的存在。勃伦塔诺今天不参加会议，据说也是想“表明”这一点。然而，两个德国的代表已经同四国外长一道面对面地坐在会议桌上了，勃伦塔诺不过是一个西方的“阿Q”而已。代表着德国人民的意志和未来的德意志民主共和国的国际威望正在蒸蒸日上，而依附外国违背德国人民利益者的遭遇是只会越来越糟糕的。
