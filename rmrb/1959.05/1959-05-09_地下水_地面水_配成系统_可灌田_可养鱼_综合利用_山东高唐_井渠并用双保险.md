　　Groundwater, Surface Water Combined into a System, Can Irrigate Fields, Can Raise Fish, Comprehensive Utilization
    Gaotang, Shandong "Well-Channel Combined Double Insurance"
    (Our report) Gaotang County, Shandong Province, has combined groundwater and surface water for comprehensive utilization, which has already yielded great results.
    Coming here, it's truly like entering a large garden. The land is in ridges, the channels form a network, the wells are in rows, looking like lines from the front and scales from an angle, with wells and channels interconnected. It can ensure that 300 mm of rainfall in three days will not overflow the drainage ditches, and 500 mm of rainfall in five days will not overflow the field ditches, with each mu (approximately 1/6 of an acre) being irrigated with 70 cubic meters of water without inter-ridge flow, ensuring even irrigation. Moreover, it allows for sectional control, avoiding water, fertilizer, and soil loss, and maintaining soil moisture, fertility, and temperature, ensuring bumper harvests regardless of drought or flood. At the same time, because the land plots are neat, with 5,000 mu forming a zone, 500 mu forming a section, 50 mu forming a square, and 5 mu forming a block, it is also convenient to strengthen the responsibility system for field management, conducive to intensive farming.
    In Gaotang County, on 1.38 million mu of cultivated land, the fourth trunk canal of the Weishan Yellow River irrigation project and its branch, distribution, farm, and field ditches, along with countless drainage ditches, crisscross, resembling a spider web. The Yellow River water is tamely channeled through the network, irrigating this land. The deep groundwater extracted by mechanical wells also irrigates these lands through the channel network. The people of Gaotang call this "Well-Channel Combined Double Insurance." Because when the weather is dry and the land is parched and crops urgently need irrigation, it is also the dry season for river channels, and relying solely on river water for irrigation is unreliable. Therefore, the people of Gaotang broke the old concept that groundwater development is not needed in surface water irrigation areas and established a new concept of "equal emphasis on channel irrigation and well irrigation." While constructing the Yellow River irrigation project, they vigorously developed groundwater resources. Up to now, 1,498 mechanical wells and more than 68,000 other types of water wells have been dug, along with 2,900 reservoirs for storage and irrigation; adding to the existing water wells, they can extract 1.4 billion cubic meters of groundwater, which can irrigate 1.8 million mu of land, accounting for 90% of the county's total cultivated land area. This spring, due to the drought and low water level in the Yellow River, when wheat needed water for greening up and land was awaiting spring planting and spring irrigation was needed, the county used well water to irrigate 510,000 mu of wheat fields and 210,000 mu of spring fields. In the past, well irrigation here only extracted shallow groundwater, with one well irrigating only a few mu of land; now, mechanical wells are used to extract deep groundwater for irrigation, with one well irrigating at least 300 mu and as many as 1,000 mu.
    One well can irrigate thousands of mu of land, which also encountered new difficulties: the land is uneven, and what to do if some places cannot be irrigated? They adopted the method of unified planning and zonal irrigation to achieve large-scale garden-like farmland. In this way, they can ensure unobstructed water flow and even irrigation. By the end of March, 109,500 mu of land in several people's communes had reached the standard of advanced garden-like farmland: ① Systematized channels (according to the farmland water conservancy conditions of Yellow River irrigation and mechanical well water extraction, six levels of channels were built: main canal, branch canal, distribution canal, farm canal, field ditch, and drainage ditch; mechanical wells are drilled at the head of the farm canal, and both gravity irrigation and mechanical well water extraction can use the same channel); ② Land leveling (leveling by sections, planting at the same elevation); ③ Standardized ridge fields (on the basis of deep plowing and land leveling, ridge fields are renovated, with the following specifications: 1.5 fen (approximately 1/10 acre) as one ridge, six ridges connected by ridge bunds as one mu, each ridge 3 meters wide and 33 meters long, ridge bund 13 cm high, 25 cm wide at the bottom, and 12 cm wide at the top); ④ Standardized roads (roads are divided into three levels: first-level roads control 1,500 to 2,000 mu of land, the road surface is 5 meters wide, 30 cm above the ground, allowing access to cars and tractors; second-level roads are between farm canals, controlling 500 mu of land, the road surface is 3 meters wide, 20 cm above the ground, allowing access to horse-drawn carts; third-level roads are made by widening the top of each level of channel bank to 1 meter, allowing access to handcarts).
    They have planted trees along both sides of the distribution canals, farm canals, and first and second-level roads. In the 28,000 mu of advanced garden-like farmland in Chengguan Commune alone, more than 74,000 poplar, willow, and fruit trees have already been planted.
    River water is warm, which is conducive to crop growth; well water is cool, which is not as good as river water. What to do? It is necessary to take the "yin water" out and sun it first, turning it into "yang water," before irrigating the land. For this reason, they created mechanical well reservoirs. For example, Jiangdian Commune, based on the suggestion made by Comrade Liu Shaoqi during his inspection there, built a reservoir, drawing water from mechanical wells and filling it in, with a capacity of more than 9,000 cubic meters. This allows not only gravity irrigation of the land but also better comprehensive utilization. They have already raised fish in the reservoir. According to the living habits of fish, three layers of fish can be raised: loach in the mud, carp in the deep water, and silver carp in the surface water. They also plan to plant lotus and water hyacinth (for feeding pigs). Alfalfa is planted inside the reservoir embankment, and camphor trees are planted outside. Aquatic products alone can generate an income of 5,000 to 6,000 yuan per year. (Gao Songshan)

　　地下水　地面水　配成系统  可灌田　可养鱼　综合利用
    山东高唐“井渠并用双保险”
    本报讯　山东省高唐县把地下水和地面水配合起来，综合利用，已经大见功效。
    走到这里，真像进了大花园。地成畦，渠成网，井成排，横看成行，斜看似鳞，井渠相通。可保证三天降雨三百公厘不出输水沟，五天降雨五百公厘不出毛渠，每亩浇七十立方水不串畦，浇得均匀。而且可以分块控制，避免水、肥、土流失，保持土壤水分、肥力和温度，旱涝保丰收。同时，因为地块整齐，五千亩为片，五百亩为段，五十亩为方，五亩为块，还便于加强田间管理的责任制，宜于精耕细作。
    高唐县境内一百三十八万亩耕地上，位山引黄灌溉工程第四干渠和它的支、斗、农、毛渠，加上无数条输水沟，纵横交错，好像蛛网。黄河水驯服地通过渠道网，灌溉着这片土地。机井提取的地下深层水，也通过渠道网，灌溉这些土地。高唐人民把这叫做“井渠并用双保险”。因为天旱地干农作物急需浇灌的时候，也正是河道枯水季节，光靠河水灌溉是靠不住的；所以，高唐人民打破了地面水灌区不需要开发地下水的老观念，树立了“渠灌井灌并重”的新观念。他们在修建引黄灌溉工程的同时，就大力开发地下水源。到目前为止，已打机井一千四百九十八眼，其他各种水井六万八千多眼，蓄、灌并用水库二千九百个；加上原有的水井，可提取地下水十四亿立方，可浇地一百八十万亩，占全县总耕地面积的90％。今春天旱，黄河水少，在小麦返青需水、正待春播的土地也需要春灌的时候，全县就用井水浇麦田五十一万亩，浇春田二十一万亩。过去这里的井灌只是提取浅层地下水，一井只浇几亩地；现在用机井提取地下深层水灌溉，一井少者可浇三百亩，多者可浇千亩左右。
    一个井可以浇上千亩地，也碰到了新的困难：土地高凹不平，有些地方浇不上怎么办？他们采取了统一规划、分区灌溉的办法，实现大地园田化。这样，就能确保水流无阻，浇得均匀。到3月底，已有几个人民公社的十万九千五百亩土地，达到高级园田化的标准：①渠道系统化（根据引黄灌溉、机井提水的农田水利条件，修建了干渠、支渠、斗渠、农渠、毛渠、输水沟六级渠道；机井打在农渠渠首，自流灌溉和机井提水灌溉都可以用同一渠道）；②土地平整化（分段找平，等高种植）；③畦田规格化（在深翻地和平整土地的基础上，整修畦田，规格是：一分五为一畦，六畦连畦埂为一亩，每畦宽三公尺，长三十三公尺，畦埂高一公寸三，底宽两公寸半，顶宽一公寸二）；④道路规格化（道路分三级：一级路控制一千五百至二千亩土地，路面宽五公尺，高出地面三公寸，可通汽车、拖拉机；二级路在农渠和农渠之间，可控制五百亩地，路面宽三公尺，高出地面两公寸，可通马车；三级路是把各级渠道堤顶加宽到一公尺，可通人力推车）。
    他们已在斗渠、农渠和一级二级道路两旁种植树木。仅城关公社的二万八千亩高级园田里，就已经植杨柳树和果树七万四千多棵。
    河水发温，宜于作物生长；井水阴凉，不如河水。怎么办？需要把“阴水”取出来先晒一晒，变成“阳水”，然后浇地。为此，他们创造了机井水库。如姜店公社，根据刘少奇同志在那里视察的时候提出的建议，修建了一座水库，把机井的水抽出来灌进去，可容九千多公方。这样既可以自流灌溉土地，又可以更好地综合利用。他们已在水库里养了鱼。根据鱼的生活习惯，可以养三层鱼：泥里养泥鳅，深水养鲤鱼，浮水养鲢鱼。他们还计划种藕和水浮莲（喂猪用）。水库堤岸里边种苜蓿，外边种上了樟树。仅水产一项，每年就可以收入五、六千元。　　　　　（高嵩山）
