Henan: A million workers launch a great campaign for increased production and economy

(Reported by this newspaper) Over a million workers on the industrial, capital construction, transportation, postal, and telecommunications fronts in Henan Province have launched a vigorous campaign to increase production and practice economy in order to realize the 1959 national plan centered on the four major indicators of steel, coal, grain, and cotton ahead of schedule.

Since the launch of the campaign to increase production and practice economy, the broad masses of workers have been in high spirits to learn from, emulate, and catch up with the advanced. In the first quarter of this year, the total industrial output value completed by the province increased three times compared with the same period last year, and new records have been constantly emerging on various fronts. Three hundred and fifty thousand iron and steel fighters, in the red flag competition for high-yield and high-quality, are doing everything possible to break through production technology barriers and strive to improve the quality of iron and complete various economic and technical indicators. After learning the high-yield and high-quality experience of Xinxiang Iron and Steel Plant No. 2, the workers of Xinxiang Iron and Steel Plant No. 1 have achieved an average blast furnace utilization coefficient of 1.032 since April, with gray pig iron accounting for 96%. Fifteen thousand workers on the coal front, in order to support steel production, launched a large-scale high-yield competition. The Jiaozuo Coal Mine saw the emergence of nine work faces with a daily output of 1,000 tons and thirty-six tunneling teams advancing one meter per work day. Workers in the machinery industry, in order to ensure the timely, high-quality, and high-quantity completion of six key products: smelting, coal washing, coking, mining, power generation equipment, and irrigation and harvesting machinery, launched the "Thousand Machine Hours" competition. Yuan Wenming, Cui Shilong, and Zhang Bohu, workers at the Luoyang Tractor Factory, improved eight tools with one machine and created a new record of 6,400 machine hours in March. Due to the widespread development of the competition, it has powerfully promoted the rapid rise of industrial production throughout the province.

Engaging in technical revolution and technical innovation, rationally adjusting labor organization, and rapidly improving labor productivity are the main characteristics of the campaign to increase production and practice economy. According to incomplete statistics, 14,000 technical innovations have been made on the industrial front in the first quarter, and 13,000 advanced experiences have been promoted. These technical innovations have not only greatly improved labor productivity, but also saved a large amount of labor and raw materials. Wang Shulin, a model worker at the Anyang Machine Tool Factory, improved six tools and equipment, increasing efficiency by more than 130 times. While engaging in technical innovation, many enterprises have begun to rectify labor organization and save labor.

Many enterprises have adopted methods such as production, excavation, conservation, and substitution to break through the raw materials barrier. The Luoyang Tractor Factory adopted the method of emphasizing both opening up new sources of income and reducing expenditure, and promoting both production and conservation. Two rounds of inventory clearing revealed 8,000 tons of steel, and the masses were mobilized to collect waste materials and set up 20 raw material satellite factories, producing a large amount of steel welding rods, refractory materials, water glass, lime, etc. At the same time, product structure was streamlined, and improving the fuel pump of the Dongfanghong tractor alone can save 300 tons of steel per year. The Luoyang Mining Machinery Factory saved more than 300 tons of steel in the first quarter alone.

Party committees at all levels attach great importance to leading the campaign to increase production and practice economy. Many leading cadres go deep into the front line, work on "experimental plots," cultivate models of increased production and economy, and make full use of the method of grasping both ends to drive the middle forward, so as to promote the continuous development of the movement. Zhang Junqing, First Secretary of the Pingdingshan Municipal Party Committee, and other responsible comrades of the Municipal Party Committee went down the mine and worked with the workers on "experimental plots." The work faces where they worked quickly broke through the target of 10,000 tons of monthly output and became models of high yield per unit area. At the same time, various industries and regions organized vigorous factory-to-factory competitions and intra-factory same-trade competitions. According to incomplete statistics, more than 500 factories and mining units have now participated in inter-factory competitions.

    革新技术成千上万　厂际竞赛烈烈轰轰
    河南百万职工大闹增产节约
    本报讯　河南工业、基本建设、交通运输、邮电战线上的百余万职工，为了提前实现1959年以钢、煤、粮、棉四大指标为中心的国家计划，开展了轰轰烈烈的增产节约运动。
    开展增产节约运动以来，广大职工学先进、比先进、赶先进的劲头十足，今年第一季度全省完成的工业总产值比去年同期增长了三倍，各个战线上的新纪录不断出现。三十五万名钢铁战士在高产优质的红旗竞赛中，千方百计地突破生产技术关，为提高铁的质量和完成各项经济技术指标而奋斗。新乡钢铁一厂职工，学习新乡钢铁二厂高产优质的经验后，4月份以来高炉平均利用系数达一点零三二，灰生铁占96％。煤炭战线上的十五万名职工，为了支援钢铁生产，开展了大面积丰产竞赛运动。焦作煤矿出现九个日产千吨工作面和三十六个每工日进一公尺的掘进组。机械工业中的职工，为了确保冶炼、洗煤、炼焦、矿山、发电设备和排灌、收割机械六种重点产品，按时按质按量地完成任务，展开了“千台时”竞赛运动。洛阳拖拉机厂工人袁文明、崔士龙、张伯虎三人一机，改进八项工具，3月份创造了六千四百台时的新纪录。由于竞赛运动的广泛开展，有力地促进了全省工业生产迅速上升。
    大搞技术革命和技术革新，合理调整劳动组织，迅速提高劳动生产率，是增产节约运动的主要特点。据不完全统计，第一季度工业战线上革新技术达一万四千件，推广先进经验一万三千项。这些技术革新不仅大大提高了劳动生产率，还节约了大量的劳动力和原材料。安阳机床厂模型工王树林改进六项工具设备，提高工效一百三十多倍。在技术革新的同时，不少企业开始整顿劳动组织，节省劳动力。
    许多企业采取生产、挖掘、节约、代用等办法，突破原材料关。洛阳拖拉机厂采取了开源节流并重、生产节约并举的办法，两次清仓查出八千吨钢材，发动群众搜集废料，举办原材料卫星工厂二十个，生产了大量的钢铁焊条、耐火材料、水玻璃、石灰等。同时精简产品结构，仅改进东方红拖拉机燃油泵一项，一年即可节约三百吨钢材。洛阳矿山机器厂第一季度仅钢材就节约三百多吨。
    各级党委十分重视对增产节约运动的领导。许多领导干部深入现场，搞“试验田”，培养增产节约标兵，充分运用抓两头带中间的方法，推动运动不断地向前发展。中共平顶山市委第一书记张俊卿和市委其他负责同志下井与工人一起搞“试验田”，他们所在的工作面都很快地突破了月产万吨的指标，成了单位面积丰产的标兵。与此同时，各产业、各地区组织了轰轰烈烈的厂际竞赛和厂际同工种竞赛。据不完全统计，现在已有五百多个厂矿单位参加了厂际竞赛。
