We fully endorse Premier Zhou's government work report and Vice Chairman Li Weihan's report on the work of the Standing Committee. Premier Zhou's report summarizes the heroic historical facts of our people of all ethnic groups, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, overfulfilling the First Five-Year Plan in accordance with the policies and guidelines proposed by the Party and Chairman Mao, and realizing a nationwide all-round Great Leap Forward last year. It also sets out a grand and ambitious blueprint for a bigger and more comprehensive leap forward this year. Vice Chairman Li Weihan's report illustrates the continuous consolidation and expansion of our people's democratic united front under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, as well as the significant role played by the organizational form of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference's united front in our people's democratic political life, and points out the direction for the CPPCC's work in the future. In Premier Zhou's report, we express our heartfelt support for the reactionary upper-class clique in Tibet launching an armed rebellion and our government's policies, guidelines, and measures for quelling the rebellion. We warmly applaud and pay our highest respects to the People's Liberation Army for its swift suppression of the rebellion with the strong support of patriotic monks, nuns, and people in Tibet. We express our utmost indignation at the conspiratorial activities of Indian expansionists in this Tibetan rebellion.

We want to warn the Indian interventionists that Tibet is China's sacred territory, and suppressing the Tibetan rebellion is China's internal affair, which brooks no external interference. The Chinese people have long stood up, and the era in which foreigners dictated the fate of the Chinese people is long gone. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the 600 million Chinese people not only drove out the Japanese imperialists during the War of Resistance against Japan, but also drove out all the imperialists from the mainland after the victory of the War of Resistance, and abolished their privileges. After the founding of the new China, American imperialism also dreamed of following the old path of Japanese aggression against China and launched the Korean War. Together with the heroic Korean people, the Chinese People's Volunteers defeated the American imperialists and their vassal states' armies, forcing the American imperialists to negotiate for peace. Now, the ambitious Indian politicians actually want to follow the old path of British imperialism's aggression against our Tibet, disgracefully inheriting its evil mantle. This is a case of Dong Shi imitating Xi Shi, wishful thinking, neither considering their virtue nor measuring their strength. We have always adhered to the principle that we will not attack unless we are attacked; if we are attacked, we will certainly counterattack mercilessly. Do not think that we are weak and can be bullied. We advise you to keep your minds calm. If you continue to be obsessed and want to gain advantages from the Tibetan rebellion, the result will certainly be contrary to your wishes and you will suffer a shameful defeat. Because your intervention not only will be resolutely opposed by the Chinese people, but also will be jointly opposed by the peace-loving Indian people.

Now let's talk about our thoughts on the Great Leap Forward.

The six of us all came from the Kuomintang and are now members of the Min革 (Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang) Shanghai organization. Over the past ten years, we have witnessed with our own eyes the people of all ethnic groups in our motherland, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, uniting closely to carry out the great socialist revolution and socialist construction, and achieving earth-shattering great achievements. These fairytale-like achievements have far exceeded what people could imagine. In particular, the completion of the First Five-Year Plan for national economic development and the all-round Great Leap Forward of 1958, with steel as the key link, not only marked the beginning of our country becoming a strong socialist country with highly developed modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture, but also the emergence of large-scale rural people's communes combining workers, peasants, merchants, students, and soldiers, shining like a rising sun, attracting global attention. No matter how the imperialists slander us, they cannot deny that our country's all-round Great Leap Forward last year was a major event of world historical significance. Faced with the unprecedented vigorous development, prosperity, and bright future of our motherland, we feel truly proud to be Chinese today.

Why is it that a country like ours, once long regarded as the "Sick Man of East Asia," poor and backward, has been able to advance so rapidly and completely change its face in just ten years since liberation? The root cause lies in the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and our incomparably superior socialist system. Under the leadership of the Party and the socialist system, the people's masses will display an overwhelming drive and exert infinite wisdom, creating endless miracles on all fronts, converging into an all-round glorious victory. This makes us think that the path we have chosen to follow the Communist Party is completely correct. We feel very resentful for having served the reactionary ruling class for a long time in the past and having done many things that were sorry to the people, and we feel infinitely honored to be able to participate in the Great Leap Forward and contribute to the great socialist cause.

In recent years, the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government have given us generous arrangements for our work, study, and life. We have not only participated in the National Political Consultative Conference at the local level, but also at the central level, and participated in the discussion of national affairs. This is the Party's great selflessness and great trust in us. However, due to insufficient subjective effort, we have not made much progress, and we have made very little contribution to the national Great Leap Forward. We feel very ashamed in our hearts. However, although some of us are over seventy years old, we have the confidence and determination to continue to exert all our strength in the motherland's Great Leap Forward to catch up with the situation, and to strive to complete the socialist cause and liberate Taiwan and realize the complete unification of the motherland. Now we would like to put forward some immature opinions on the issue of our future work direction, that is, how members of democratic parties can play an active role in the Great Leap Forward. Please give us your comments.

The vast majority of members of democratic parties are old intellectuals. Premier Zhou pointed out in his report: "Old intellectuals who stand on the socialist side in politics and are with the broad masses of the people can use their knowledge and technology in the socialist cause, give play to their expertise, and be welcomed by the people." He also said: "All democratic parties have rectified their organizations in the rectification campaign; they are still playing an active role in uniting different social forces to serve socialism." We feel that Premier Zhou's words show his deep expectations for members of our democratic parties. Taking the Shanghai local organization of the Min革 as an example, in 1958, under the brilliant illumination of the Party's general line, under the impetus of the national Great Leap Forward, and under the leadership of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Central Committee of the Min革, it carried out a relatively in-depth rectification on the basis of the victory of the anti-Rightist struggle. For example, about 300,000 big-character posters were posted throughout the city for airing views, debates, and heart-to-heart talks, and more than 90% of the members formulated personal transformation plans, and many groups for studying Chairman Mao's works were organized. More than 10% of the members in organs, enterprises, and schools participated in labor training in the countryside and factories, and some regularly participated in physical labor. More than 70% of social members, based on their physical condition, age, and different conditions, volunteered to strive for different ways to participate in various social practices and productive labor practices. In addition, organizational rectification was carried out, which has brought about major changes in the political and organizational aspects of the Shanghai organization of the Min革. However, this is only a new beginning, and it is still far from meeting the requirements of the Great Leap Forward. It needs to be further strengthened, all positive factors mobilized, and we must strive to complete the socialist revolution and socialist construction. That is:

First, actively participate in opposing imperialist aggression and smashing the conspiracies of enemies at home and abroad, and strive to liberate Taiwan, consolidate the unification of the motherland, and promote peaceful construction. Taiwan is China's territory, and we must liberate it. According to the historical characteristics of the Min革 and the relationship between many relatives and friends of Kuomintang military and political personnel in Taiwan, we should use various methods to tell them about the facts that we have seen with our own eyes of the unity of all ethnic groups and the all-round Great Leap Forward under the leadership of the Party, especially the countless specific examples of promoting production and improving people's lives after the collectivization of people's communes. We should also tell them about the preferential treatment we have personally received from the Party and the People's Government, and the situation of our happy work, study, and life here, in order to dispel their various doubts, unite under the banner of patriotism, unite and consistently confront the outside world, and resolutely oppose the conspiracy of American imperialism to flaunt its power in Taiwan, our territory, and to create "two Chinas." The Taiwan issue is China's internal affair, and it must be handled by the Chinese people themselves, and no outside interference is allowed. Just like what we said before, no external interference is allowed in our suppression of the Tibetan rebellion. Anyone who attempts to interfere in our internal affairs and infringe upon our territorial sovereignty will be battered and shattered and suffer a complete defeat.

Second, actively participate in socialist construction. The vast majority of our Min革 members in Shanghai work in organs, enterprises, and schools, and a small number are social members. In terms of age, most are middle-aged and older. According to the experience of the Great Leap Forward in 1958, as long as we are truly willing to serve socialism, not only can members in organs, enterprises, and schools give full play to their role, but also social members can play a role in various production labor and cultural revolution tasks, such as literacy campaigns and patriotic health campaigns. Some elderly members have also performed well. In the future, we must continue to vigorously promote members and social contacts to join the red flag competition movement centered on increasing production and practicing economy together with the people of the whole country, and strive to complete the grand plan for 1959.

Third, further strengthen self-transformation. Since most of the Min革 members have spent a long time in the old society and have been deeply influenced by the ideology of reactionary factions at home and abroad in the past, it is even more necessary to strengthen socialist self-transformation. Only by better self-transformation can we better play an active role in the Great Leap Forward. According to countless facts in the ten years since liberation, especially the facts after last year's rectification, it has been proved that the fundamental transformation of the political stance of members of democratic parties is not only necessary but also possible. The Party's policy of unity, education, and transformation is correct. After last year's rectification campaign, members of the Shanghai Min革 have improved their ideological understanding to varying degrees, which is a gratifying phenomenon. However, achieving a complete transformation is still arduous, repetitive, and long-term, and requires the greatest determination and continuous efforts to gradually achieve it in long-term work practice.

In order to complete the above three tasks for members of democratic parties, we believe that the first thing is to accept the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party wholeheartedly, and give full play to the organizational role of democratic parties under this premise. That is, the organizations and members of democratic parties at all levels should resolutely accept the leadership of the Communist Party committees in their respective regions or organs, enterprises, and schools, and give maximum play to their initiative and enthusiasm under the leadership of the Party committees, serving the socialist cause by mobilizing all positive factors. Resolutely oppose any tendency to weaken or deviate from the leadership of the Party. Because if we leave the leadership of the Party, we will lose our direction and become isolated from the masses of the people. However, at the same time, we must also oppose the lazy thinking in politics, passively waiting, not actively striving to play our active role, fearing to make mistakes, fearing to take responsibility, and other timid emotions. This is another manifestation of the bourgeois individualistic stance and has nothing in common with the socialist stance.

Secondly, we must carry out self-transformation in service and combine transformation with service. We must vigorously promote members and people we contact to enthusiastically participate in the red flag competition movement centered on increasing production and practicing economy in different positions, and earnestly revise, check, and implement personal red and expert plans. We must also open our minds and dare to think, dare to speak, dare to act, and dare to do things for the sake of serving socialism. Be a promoter in the ranks of the Great Leap Forward. Organizations at all levels should always go deep to understand the ideological mainstream of members in the Great Leap Forward, cooperate with the leadership of the Party committees in the area, and provide guidance. The general requirement is that everyone should get on the galloping horse of the Leap Forward. Those who are on the horse should whip the horse faster and gallop forward.

Finally, we must keep in mind the earnest instructions given to us by the Premier in his report: "No matter what job we are in, we should earnestly study Marxism-Leninism while striving to improve our professional level, participate in the production and struggle practices of the masses, participate in physical labor, and strictly demand ourselves in political thought and work." "All patriotic intellectuals should unite under the banner of socialism and work together to build a great motherland."

Fellow committee members: This meeting of ours and the National People's Congress are a grand gathering of unprecedented unity of all ethnic groups, and also a grand gathering of the Great Leap Forward. We have participated in and attended these two historically significant meetings with very excited moods. We guarantee to bring the spirit of the meetings back and implement the resolutions of the two meetings with concrete actions and strive to realize our country's grand economic plan for 1959.

    怎样在大跃进中发挥积极作用
    贾亦斌　武和轩　黄启汉  薛笃弼　张之江　刘昌义委员的发言
    我们完全拥护周总理所作的政府工作报告和李维汉副主席所作的常务委员会工作报告。总理的报告总结了我国各族人民在中国共产党领导下按照党和毛主席提出来的政策方针超额完成第一个五年计划和去年实现全民全面大跃进的英雄史实，并为今年更大更全面的跃进制定了宏伟豪迈的图景。李维汉副主席的报告，说明了我国人民民主统一战线在中国共产党领导下不断地巩固与扩大，以及中国人民政治协商会议的统一战线组织形式在我国人民民主政治生活中所起的重大作用，并且对今后政协工作指出了方向。在周总理的报告中，指出西藏上层反动集团发动武装叛乱以及我国政府的平乱方针政策和措施，我们表示衷心的拥护。对于我人民解放军在西藏爱国僧俗人民的大力支持下迅速平定了叛乱，我们热烈欢呼并致崇高的敬意。对于印度扩张主义分子在这次西藏叛乱中的阴谋活动，表示无比的愤慨。
    我们要警告印度干涉者，西藏是中国的神圣领土，平定西藏叛乱是中国人的内政，不容许任何外来的干涉。中国人早已站立起来了，外国人摆布中国人的命运的时代早已一去不复返了，中国六亿人民在中国共产党的领导下，不仅在抗战时期赶走了日本帝国主义者，抗战胜利以后又在大陆上赶走了所有的帝国主义者，取消了它们的特权。新中国建国后，美帝国主义也曾梦想沿袭日本侵略中国的老路，发动侵朝战争。我国人民志愿军和朝鲜英雄人民一起，又打垮美帝国主义和仆从国家的军队，使美帝国主义者被迫讲和。现在印度的野心家居然想沿着英帝国主义侵略我国西藏的老路，很不光彩地承袭它的罪恶的衣钵，真是东施效颦，异想天开，既不度德又不量力了。我们从来是人不犯我，我不犯人的，但是不要以为我们是软弱可欺，人若犯我，我们必给予无情的反击，奉劝你们头脑冷静些吧，如果继续执迷不悟，想从西藏叛乱中获取便宜，其结果一定和你们的愿望相反，遭到可耻的失败。因为你们的干涉行为不仅中国人民坚决反对，爱好和平的印度人民也会起来共同反对。
    现在谈一谈我们对大跃进的感想。
    我们六人都是从国民党分化出来的，现在是民革上海组织的成员。十年来我们亲眼看到祖国各族人民在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，亲密团结，进行伟大的社会主义革命和社会主义建设，取得了惊天动地的伟大成就。这些像神话般的成就，远远超过了人们所能想像的程度。特别是国民经济发展第一个五年计划的完成和一九五八年以钢为纲的全面大跃进，不仅标志着是我国将成为一个具有高度发展的现代工业，现代农业，现代科学文化的富强的社会主义国家的开始，而且农村中大规模的，工农商学兵相结合的政社合一的人民公社的出现，正像初升的太阳一样照耀到人间，引起了全球的注意，不管帝国主义者对我们怎样诬蔑，但是他们也不能不承认去年我国的全面大跃进，是具有世界历史意义的一件重大事情。我们面对祖国这种史无前例的蓬勃发展，欣欣向荣，前途如锦的景象，感到今天作为一个中国人，真是可以自豪。
    为什么像我们这样一个过去曾经长期被人视为“东亚病夫”、贫穷落后的国度，解放仅仅十年就能够这样突飞猛进，完全改变面貌呢？归根结底是在于我们有中国共产党和毛主席的领导，和我们有无比优越的社会主义制度的关系。在党的领导和社会主义制度下，就会出现人民群众以排山倒海的冲天干劲，发挥无穷智慧，在各个战线上创造层出不穷的奇迹，汇成全面辉煌的胜利。由此使我们连想到所选择的跟共产党走的道路是完全正确的。而对于自己以从长期为反动统治阶级服务，作了不少对不起人民的事，感到非常痛恨，对于现在能够参加大跃进的行列为伟大的社会主义事业尽一分力，感到无限光荣。
    几年来中国共产党和人民政府对我们的工作、学习、生活，都给予优厚的安排，我们不仅在地方而且先后在中央参加了全国政治协商会议，参与国家大事的讨论，这是党的大公无私和对我们的极大信任。可是我们由于主观努力不够，进步不大，在全国大跃进中贡献极微，内心实在感到惭愧。不过我们几个人有的年龄虽然超过了七十岁，我们有信心，有决心继续要在祖国大跃进中，尽自己的全部力量赶上形势，为完成社会主义事业和解放台湾，实现祖国的完全统一而奋斗到底。现在我们想就我们自己今后工作努力方向的问题，也就是在大跃进中民主党派成员如何发挥积极作用问题提出一些不成熟意见，请予指正。
    民主党派成员，绝大多数是旧知识分子，周总理报告中指出：“旧知识分子在政治上站到社会主义这一方面来，同广大人民在一起，就能够在社会主义事业中运用他们所掌握的知识和技术，发挥他们的专长，受到人民的欢迎。”又说：“各民主党派在整风中都整顿了自己的组织；他们在团结不同的社会力量来为社会主义服务的事业中，仍然起着积极的作用。”我们体会总理这番话对我们民主党派成员的期望是很深切的。就民革上海地方组织来说，一九五八年它在党的总路线光辉照耀下，在全国大跃进的形势推动下，和在中共上海市委和民革中央的领导下，在反右派斗争胜利基础上进行了比较深入的整风。如全市鸣放、辩论和交心的大字报约有三十万张，百分之九十以上的成员都制定了个人改造规划，还组织了不少学习毛主席著作的小组。在机关、企业、学校的成员，有百分之十以上参加了下放农村工厂劳动锻炼，一部分定期参加体力劳动。社会成员有百分之七十以上根据身体、年龄，条件的不同，在自愿基础上争取不同的方式，参加各种社会实践与生产劳动实践。此外还进行了组织整顿，这样就使民革上海组织在政治面貌和组织面貌上都有了较大的变化。但这不过是一个新的开始，和大跃进形势的要求还差得很远，还需要进一步加强改造，调动一切积极因素为完成社会主义革命和社会主义建设而奋斗。这就是：
    第一、积极参加反对帝国主义侵略和粉碎国内外敌人的阴谋活动，为解放台湾，巩固祖国统一与和平建设而奋斗。台湾是中国的领土，我们一定要解放。根据民革的历史特点，和台湾国民党军政人员有不少亲属朋友的关系。我们应该把我们亲眼看到的各族人民团结无间，在党领导下的全面大跃进的事实，特别是人民公社化以后对促进生产和改善人民生活的无数具体事例，用各种各样方法告诉他们。并告诉他们关于我们每个人亲身受到党和人民政府的优待以及我们在这里愉快工作学习生活的情况，以解除他们的各种疑虑，并在爱国主义旗帜下，团结起来一致对外，坚决反对美帝国主义在我国领土台湾耀武扬威以及制造“两个中国”的阴谋。台湾问题，是我国内政，一定要由我们中国人自己处理，不容外人干涉。就像前面所说的我们平定西藏叛乱不容任何外来干涉一样。凡是企图干涉我国内政，侵犯我国领土主权的，都要碰得头破血流，遭到彻底的失败。
    第二、积极参加社会主义建设。我们在上海的民革成员，绝大多数是在机关、企业、学校里工作的，一小部分是社会成员。按年龄来说，中年以上的居多。根据一九五八年大跃进的经验，只要真正愿意为社会主义服务，不仅在机关、企业、学校的成员可以充分发挥作用，即社会成员也能在参加各种生产劳动和文化革命的各项工作中，如扫盲，爱国卫生运动等等，发挥作用。有些老年成员表现也好。今后我们要在这个基础上继续大力推动成员和社会联系人士跟全国人民一起，为完成一九五九年的宏伟计划而奋斗。
    第三、进一步加强自我改造。这里由于民革成员，大多数在旧社会的时间较长，过去受到国内外反动派的思想影响比较深，因此对于加强社会主义的自我改造，更有必要。也只有更好地进行自我改造，才能更好地在大跃进中充分发挥积极作用。根据解放十年来的无数事实，特别是经过去年整风的事实证明，民主党派成员进行政治立场的根本改造不仅是必要的而且是可能的。党的团结、教育、改造政策是正确的，上海民革成员经过去年的整风运动，在思想认识上，各人都有不同程度的提高，这是一种可喜的现象。但要达到脱胎换骨的自我改造还是艰巨的反复的长期性的，需要下最大的决心，不断地努力，在长期的工作实践中逐步地实现。
    民主党派成员要完成以上三项任务，我们认为首先要一心一意接受中国共产党的领导，并在这个前提下充分发挥民主党派的组织作用。也就是民主党派各级组织和成员，应坚决接受所在地区或机关、企业、学校的中共党委的领导，在党委领导下，最大限度地发挥主动性，积极性，通过调动一切积极因素为社会主义事业服务。坚决反对任何削弱和脱离党的领导的倾向。因为离开了党的领导，我们就会迷失方向，就会在人民群众中孤立。但与此同时还须反对政治上的懒汉思想，消极等待，不积极努力发挥自己的积极作用，怕犯错误，怕负责等等畏首畏尾的情绪。这是资产阶级个人主义立场的另一种表现，和社会主义立场没有一点共同之处。
    其次，我们要在服务中进行自我改造把改造与服务结合起来。我们要大力推动成员和所联系人士在不同岗位上热烈投入以增产节约为中心的红旗竞赛的运动中，并认真修订、检查、实现个人的红专规划。还要大家敞开思想，在为社会主义服务的基础上敢想、敢说、敢做、敢为。在大跃进的行列中做一个促进派，各级组织应该随时深入了解成员在大跃进中的思想主流，配合所在地的党委的领导，予以诱导，总的要求是要人人跨上跃进大马，上了马的就要快马加鞭，向前奔驰。
    最后，我们要牢记着总理在他的报告中给我们的恳切指示：“不论在什么工作岗位上，都应当在努力提高自己的业务水平的同时，认真地学习马克思列宁主义，参加群众的生产和斗争的实践，参加体力劳动，在政治思想上和在工作中严格地要求自己。”“一切爱国的知识分子都应当在社会主义的旗帜下面团结起来，共同为建设伟大的祖国而努力。”
    各位委员：我们这次会议和全国人民代表大会是各族人民空前大团结的大会，也是大跃进的大会。我们几个人以十分激动的心情分别参加和列席了这两个具有历史意义的大会，我们保证一定把大会的精神带回去，并以具体行动来贯彻两个大会的决议和为实现我国一九五九年宏伟的经济计划而奋斗。
