Chairman, fellow representatives, fellow committee members:

I fully agree with and wholeheartedly and enthusiastically support Premier Zhou Enlai's "Government Work Report," Vice Premier Li Fuchun's "Report on the Draft National Economic Plan for 1959," Vice Premier Li Xiannian's "Report on the State Final Accounts for 1958 and the Draft State Budget for 1959," and the work reports delivered by Vice Chairman Peng Zhen and Vice Chairman Li Weihan on behalf of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and the Standing Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, respectively.

After listening to this series of reports, I, like the vast majority of scientific workers across the country, have seen the magnificent achievements our country has made in all aspects during the First Five-Year Plan period. I have also seen the comprehensive Great Leap Forward on all fronts in our country in 1958, and the orderly and practical draft national economic plan for 1959 and the state final accounts for 1958 and the draft state budget for 1959. I feel very excited and encouraged, and I have further realized that only the Chinese Communist Party, the People's Government, and the great and wise leader Chairman Mao can master science, lead science, and ensure that all plans and measures are based on scientific principles. The superiority of socialism is built on a scientific foundation, so it can fully unleash productive potential, creating the unprecedented industrial and agricultural Great Leap Forward and the great progress in production technology, science, and culture last year.

Our country's rapid progress in recent years has opened a glorious new era in the history of science, further proving that the East Wind has prevailed over the West Wind. This is something imperialism will never accept, so they spread rumors and lies everywhere, sowing discord. Recently, they have even exploited the Tibetan rebellion to make a big fuss. Tibet is an inseparable part of the sacred territory of the People's Republic of China, and the Tibetan people are members of our multi-ethnic family. Long history and the relationship after liberation have fully proven this. Recently, I suddenly heard various absurd remarks such as "Tibetans are not Han Chinese" and "Tibet should be independent." The interventionists in India say this, and the American and British imperialists say this even more. Isn't this utterly absurd? If Tibetans are not Han Chinese and should be independent, then the Black people and Native Americans in the United States should also secede from the United States and declare independence.

Our heroic People's Liberation Army has already quelled the rebellion in Tibet, controlling the Shannan area and the northern part of the Himalayas. We have the conditions to build a paradise on earth in Tibet in the near future. From a scientific perspective, Tibet is a rich treasure trove, a great arena for scientific workers to use their talents. It is our responsibility to develop its resources to improve the living standards and cultural level of the Tibetan people. Therefore, I feel excited and encouraged once again upon hearing about the suppression of the rebellion.

I am a staff member of a chemical research institution (North China Design and Research Branch of the Ministry of Chemical Industry). I have received a profound education at this conference and feel extremely happy and encouraged. I am determined to dedicate all my strength and take practical actions to do a good job in the following specific tasks.

(1) Intensify the study of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, arm myself with the proletarian scientific revolutionary worldview, gradually undergo a transformation, and transform myself into a proletarian intellectual who is both red and expert, deeply red and proficient, and self-reliant.

(2) Firmly and sincerely accept the leadership of the Party, accept the leadership of the working class, fully mobilize the masses, rely on the masses, and do more scientific publicity work among the masses to promote the great strength and infinite wisdom of the masses.

(3) Based on the work already done by our institute, continue to vigorously promote the utilization and research of boron mineral resources in Qinghai and Tibet, and further promote the research of advanced boron compounds.

(4) Based on the data recently obtained by the working group of our institute in a factory in Shanghai, quickly promote the design work of titanium dioxide (titanium dioxide) manufacturing plants, so that Guangdong, Sichuan, and other regions can build factories producing titanium dioxide within the year to meet the urgent needs of rubber, welding, coatings, papermaking, rayon, optical glass, and other fields.

(5) Vigorously assist in the verification work of the Yongjiu Alkali Plant, so that our country's alkali-making industry can have a more solid theoretical foundation, so as to further surpass the world level (our institute has completed the verification work of the ammonia distillation tower of the Yongjiu Alkali Plant).

(6) Drawing on the experience of the newly built factory of Tianjin Paint and Pigment General Factory, vigorously assist other regions (especially Shanghai) in building large-scale, relatively modern paint factories, consolidating small units into a whole to reduce the waste of manpower and material resources and meet the urgent needs of national defense and industry.

(7) Vigorously promote the cultivation and research of tung oil and natural lacquer, utilize ancient methods, and improve them to promote the excellent coating heritage that our motherland has accumulated for thousands of years, so that the paint industry can adopt both foreign and indigenous methods, "walking on two legs."

(8) Further study Russian and strive for advanced studies to make conversation fluent, so as to correct the current problem of having a head but no tail (verb endings). At the same time, review the German and French languages that have been forgotten for a long time, so as to smoothly read scientific literature.

(9) Compile three scientific books before 1962, striving to achieve the three characteristics advocated by Chairman Mao – accuracy, vividness, and flexibility.

(10) Maintain close contact with production plants and mines, go to workshops to learn from veteran workers and young workers, so that the three major tasks of research, design, and production of our institute can be thoroughly implemented.

(11) Under the leadership of the Foreign Liaison Department of the Ministry of Chemical Industry, strengthen contact with research institutions cooperating with the Soviet Union, try to solicit the opinions of the Soviet side, and accept their selfless assistance, so that the design and research work of our institute can take fewer detours and proceed along the correct technical route, so as to make greater, better, faster, and more economical leaps forward.

(12) Vigorously do a good job in contacting fraternal research institutions (especially those directly under the Ministry of Chemical Industry), divide labor and cooperate, save manpower and material resources, so that our country's scientific research work can gradually move towards the goal of "one game of chess in the whole country" and reach and surpass international levels as soon as possible. (Recently, our institute has made preliminary contact with the Shanghai Chemical Research Institute, and I am very happy!)

Recently, I heard my old friend Hou Debang say: "Young people can dedicate their precious youth to socialist construction, can't older scientific workers dedicate their remaining years to socialist construction?" I am very moved. At sunset, we should release extraordinary splendor. I am willing to follow the older scientific workers across the country and compete with young scientific workers, working for socialist construction until the last minute.

### 加紧自我改造做好化工研究工作  陈调甫委员的发言

    加紧自我改造做好化工研究工作
    陈调甫委员的发言主席、各位代表、各位委员：
    我完全同意并衷心地热烈拥护周恩来总理的“政府工作报告”，李富春副总理的“关于一九五九年国民经济计划草案的报告”，李先念副总理的“关于一九五八年国家决算和一九五九年国家预算草案的报告”，及彭真副委员长和李维汉副主席分别代表人大常务委员会和政协常务委员会所作的工作报告。
    听了这一系列的报告，我同全国绝大多数的科学工作者一样，看到了第一个五年计划期内我们国家在各方面的宏伟的成就，又看到了一九五八年我们国家在各个战线上全面大跃进，以及有条不紊切切实实的一九五九年国民经济计划草案和一九五八年国家的决算及一九五九年国家的预算草案，感觉到非常地兴奋和鼓舞，更进一步认识到只有中国共产党和人民政府及伟大英明的领袖毛主席，才能掌握科学，领导科学，一切计划，一切措施，都有科学根据的，社会主义的优越性，是建筑在科学的基础上的，所以能充分发挥生产的潜力，造成去年史无前例的工农业大跃进，生产技术科学文化的大进步。
    我国近年来的突飞猛进，在科学史上开辟了光辉灿烂的一个新纪元，进一步证明东风已经压倒了西风，这是帝国主义所决不甘心的，处处造谣说谎，挑拨离间，近更利用西藏叛乱事件，大做其文章。西藏是中华人民共和国神圣领土的一部分，藏族人民是我们这个多民族的大家庭中成员之一，长期的历史，解放后的关系，早已充分证明了这一点。近来忽然听到了“藏人不是汉人”，“西藏应当独立”等种种谰言，印度的干涉者这样说，美英帝国主义更这样说，岂非荒谬绝伦。如果说藏人不是汉人，应当独立，那末美国的黑人、印第安人，亦应脱离合众国而宣告独立了。
    我们的英勇的人民解放军，已经荡平了西藏的叛乱，控制了山南地区和喜马拉雅山的北部，我们有条件在最近的将来，在西藏建成一个人间的乐园。从科学的眼光观察，西藏是一个丰富的宝库，是科学工作者大好用武之场，开发富源以提高藏人的生活和文化水平，是我们的责任，所以我听到了叛乱的平定，又一次感到兴奋和鼓舞。
    我是化工研究机关工作人员之一（化学工业部华北设计研究分院），在这次大会中受到了深刻无比的教育和感到极大的欢欣和鼓舞，我下了决心，愿尽我一切的力量，以实际行动作好以下几项具体工作。
    （1）加紧学习马克思列宁主义和毛泽东思想，以无产阶级的科学的革命的世界观来武装自己，逐步脱胎换骨，把自己改造成为又红又专，红透专深，自食其力的无产阶级的知识分子。
    （2）坚定不移诚心诚意地接受党的领导，接受工人阶级的领导，充分发动群众，依靠群众，多向群众作科学宣传工作，以发扬群众的伟大力量和无穷智慧。
    （3）在本院已做的工作基础上，继续大力推动青海、西藏硼矿资源的利用和研究，并进一步推动尖端硼化合物的研究。
    （4）在最近我院工作小组在上海某厂所得的数据的基础上，迅速推动钛白（二氧化钛）制造厂的设计工作，使广东、四川及其它地区能在年内建成生产钛白的工厂，以应橡胶、电焊、涂料、造纸、人造纤维、光学玻璃等各方面迫切的需要。
    （5）大力协助永久沽厂的查定工作，使我国制碱工业能有更巩固的理论基础，以便更进一步超过世界的水平（我院参加沽厂蒸铵塔查定工作已完成）。
    （6）吸取天津市油漆颜料总厂最近建成新厂的经验，大力协助其它地区（尤其是上海市）建设大型的比较近代化的油漆工厂，化零为整，以减少人力物力的浪费，并满足国防方面和工业方面迫切的需要。
    （7）大力推动桐油和天然漆的培植和研究，利用古法，加以改进，以发扬祖国数千年来传统的优良的涂料遗产，使油漆工业洋土并举，“用两条腿走路”。
    （8）进一步学习俄文，力求深造，使会话流利，以矫正现在有头无尾（语尾变化）之弊。同时把久忘不用德法文温习起来，以便顺利地阅读科学文献。
    （9）在一九六二年以前编写成三部科学书籍，力求达到毛主席所提倡的三性——准确性、生动性、灵活性。
    （10）与生产厂矿多作密切的联系，多到车间向工人老师傅学习，向青年工人学习，使本院的研究、设计、生产三种重大任务，可以贯彻一竿子到底。
    （11）在化工部对外联络司领导之下，加强与苏联协作的研究机关的联系，尽量征求苏方的意见，接受他们的无私的援助，使本院的设计和研究工作，少走弯路，向准确的技术路线进行，能更多更好更快更省地大大跃进。
    （12）大力做好与兄弟研究机关（尤其是化学工业部直属的研究机关）的联系，分工协作，节省人力物力，使我国的科学研究工作，能逐步趋向“全国一盘棋”的目标，早日达到并超越国际水平。（最近本院已与上海化工研究院作好初步的联系，我很愉快！）
    最近我听到老友侯德榜同志说：“青年们能把他们宝贵的青春贡献给社会主义建设，老年的科学工作者不能把他们的余年贡献给社会主义建设吗？”我大为感动，夕阳西下之时，本应放出异彩，我愿追随全国老年科学工作者之后，同青年科学工作者比赛一下，为社会主义建设工作到最后一分钟。
