Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 26th. The 75.6 mu of barley in the Sanchagang Production Team of the Dingpai Brigade of the Gaoqiao Commune in Pudong County, Shanghai, had a bumper harvest, with an average yield per mu increasing by 1.88 times compared to last year, firing the first shot for a bountiful summer crop harvest in Shanghai.

The 75.6 mu of Dongyang barley planted by this production team was harvested, threshed, awns removed, winnowed, screened, and sun-dried for half a day. After weighing and acceptance, it yielded a total of 49,003 jin of moist barley, with an average yield of 648.19 jin of moist barley per mu. According to the technical personnel of the Shanghai Municipal Grain Bureau Management Warehouse, who conducted tests and appraisals according to the barley storage standards, the average yield of dry barley was 518.55 jin per mu, an increase of 1.88 times compared to the local barley yield of 180 jin per mu last year.

On the 23rd and 24th, Ke Qingshi, First Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, Secretaries Chen Pixian and Wei Wenbo, and more than 300 cadres from the Municipal Committee, together with cadres from the Pudong County Committee and local garrison troops, a total of more than 600 people, came to help the Sanchagang Production Team harvest barley. They participated in all the work of harvesting, threshing, winnowing, screening, weighing, acceptance, and land measurement. Comrade Ke Qingshi and other responsible comrades of the Municipal Committee personally measured the land, supervised the weighing, and accepted 1.64 mu of wheat, which yielded a total of 1,074.22 jin of moist wheat, with an average yield of 655 jin of moist wheat per mu.

This piece of barley field in the Sanchagang Production Team is a sandy beach, and the natural conditions are not very good. When the barley was heading, it was hit by a typhoon. However, under the leadership of the commune, the members absorbed the experiences of the Great Leap Forward last year, resolutely implemented the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture, and brought into play their vigorous enthusiasm, finally achieving a bumper harvest. This piece of land was deep-plowed to a depth of 1.5 chi, and 60 to 80 jin of seeds were sown per mu. After the wheat seedlings grew, they were thinned out because they were too dense. According to the estimation of the old farmers, about half of them were thinned out. After thinning, the density of wheat seedlings was equivalent to sowing 30 to 40 jin, which was more than double the amount of seeds sown in the local past.

Near this barley field of the Sanchagang Production Team, there was a piece of Yuan wheat field belonging to the individual peasant household of Lu Yuanhong. He and his wife did not believe in the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture, and neither deep-plowed nor densely planted. They only sowed eight jin of wheat seeds per mu, resulting in an average yield of only 143 jin of moist wheat per mu. The commune's yield of barley per mu was three and a half times more than that of the individual household. With the same natural conditions, the same time, and such a disparity in harvest, the facts best answered the benefits of deep plowing and close planting and the superiority of the people's commune, which is large in size and has a high degree of public ownership. The old farmers celebrated the bumper harvest with joy. They said happily: Listening to Chairman Mao is never wrong, the people's commune is really good, and the "Eight-Character Charter" is really effective. With the good experiences of last year and this year, we will definitely increase production greatly at the beginning of the year.

At present, the summer harvest has begun in all counties of Shanghai. The growth of wheat this year is very good. The barley of the Sanchagang Production Team in Pudong County is of medium to upper grade among the barley, wheat, and Yuan wheat in the counties of Shanghai. The rapeseed that will be harvested soon in the counties of Shanghai is also growing very well. Before the secretaries of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China participated in the labor on the 23rd, they inspected the rapeseed in the Jinjiaqiao area of Pudong County, where nearly 6,000 mu of rapeseed grew taller than people and were full of pods, promising a bumper harvest.

### 上海夏季丰收第一炮  三岔港七十五亩大麦亩产五一八斤

    上海夏季丰收第一炮
    三岔港七十五亩大麦亩产五一八斤
    新华社上海26日电  上海市浦东县高桥公社丁派大队三岔港生产队的七十五亩六分大麦大丰收，平均亩产量比去年增长了一点八八倍，打响了上海市夏季作物丰收的第一炮。
    这个生产队种植的七十五亩六分东洋大麦，经过收割、脱粒，去掉芒壳，扬净、筛清、晒了半天，过秤验收，共收获潮麦四万九千零三斤，平均亩产潮麦六百四十八点一九斤。经市粮食局管理仓库的技术人员按大麦入库标准试验鉴定，平均亩产干麦五百一十八点五五斤，比当地去年大麦亩产量一百八十斤增长了一点八八倍。
    23、24两天，中共上海市委第一书记柯庆施，书记处书记陈丕显、魏文伯和市委机关干部三百余人，加上浦东县委机关干部和当地驻军，共六百余人，都来帮助三岔港生产队收打大麦。他们参加了收割、脱粒、扬净、筛清、过秤、验收和丈量土地等的全部工作。柯庆施等市委负责同志还亲自丈量土地、监秤、验收了一亩六分四厘田的麦子，这一亩六分四厘田，共收潮麦一千零七十四点二二斤，平均亩产潮麦六百五十五斤。
    三岔港生产队的这一片大麦田，是一种沙滩地，自然条件并不算好，在大麦抽穗的时候，曾遭过风灾，但是社员们在公社领导下，吸取去年大跃进的经验，坚决贯彻农业“八字宪法”，发挥了旺盛的干劲，终于取得了大丰收。这片土地，深耕一尺五寸，每亩下种六十到八十斤，麦苗长出来以后，因为太密了，曾经进行间苗。据老农估计，大约间去一半左右。间苗以后，麦苗的密度相当于下种三、四十斤，比当地历年习惯下种的数量增加了一倍多。
    就在三岔港生产队这块大麦田的附近，有单干户陆元红的一块元麦田，他夫妻俩不相信农业“八字宪法”，既没有深耕，也不愿密植，每亩只下八斤麦种，结果每亩平均只收一百四十三斤潮麦。公社大麦的亩产量比单干户的产量多出三倍半。自然条件相同，时间相同，收获量如此悬殊，事实最好的回答了深耕密植的好处，人民公社一大二公的优越性。老农们喜庆丰收，他们兴高采烈地说：听毛主席的话，永远不会错，人民公社真正好，“八字宪法”真灵光，有了去年和今年的好经验，开年肯定还要大增产。
    目前，上海各县夏收已经全面开始。今年麦子的生长情况很好。浦东县三岔港生产队的大麦在上海各县的大麦、小麦、元麦中，属于中上等。上海各县即将收获的油菜也长得很好，23日中共上海市委书记们参加劳动以前，曾视察了浦东县金家桥一带的油菜，那里近六千亩油菜，长得高过人头，结荚累累，丰收在望。
