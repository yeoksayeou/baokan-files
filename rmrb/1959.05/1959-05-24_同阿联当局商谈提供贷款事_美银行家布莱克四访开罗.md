Concerning Discussions with UAR Authorities on Providing Loans
US Banker Black Visits Cairo for the Fourth Time

This newspaper reports that the President of the World Bank, American Mr. Black, arrived in Cairo on the 19th. That evening, Mr. Black held talks with UAR President Nasser on the issue of providing loans.

Since the beginning of this year, Mr. Black has visited the UAR four times. The first time was at the beginning of this year. At that time, Mr. Black came forward at the request of the British and UAR governments to "mediate" the dispute between the two countries.

At the end of February and the beginning of March, Mr. Black visited Cairo again. According to American newspapers, the purpose of Mr. Black's trip was to discuss loan plans for deepening and widening the Suez Canal. From May 10th to 11th, Mr. Black visited Cairo again and had lengthy talks with UAR President Nasser and UAR Minister of Economy, Kaissouny.

According to various sources, the negotiations between the World Bank and the UAR authorities on the loan issue have not yet reached a final agreement. An editorial in the "Egyptian News" on May 20th stated that it is not yet certain that the American "government has seen the harm of 'conditional' aid and the indecent position of the recipient country compared to the donor country." The editorial said that once the United States accepts reality, "then there seems to be no sufficient reason why a new era of friendly cooperation between the UAR and the United States cannot be opened."

    同阿联当局商谈提供贷款事
    美银行家布莱克四访开罗
    本报讯　世界银行行长、美国人布莱克19日到达开罗。当天晚间，布莱克和阿联总统纳赛尔就提供贷款问题，进行了会谈。
    自今年以来，布莱克已先后四次访问阿联。第一次是在今年年初。当时布莱克应英国和阿联政府的要求出面“调解”两国之间的争端。
    2月底3月初，布莱克再度访问了开罗。据美国报纸透露，布莱克此行的目的是讨论加深加宽苏伊士运河的贷款计划。5月10—11日，布莱克再度访问开罗，曾同阿联总统纳赛尔和阿联经济部长凯舒尼作了长时间的会谈。
    据各方面消息透露，世界银行和阿联当局关于贷款问题的谈判，
  目前仍未达成最后协议。5月20日“埃及新闻报”的社论说：目前还不能肯定美国“政府已经看出‘附有条件’的援助的坏处和受援国家同施主国家相形之下的不体面的地位”。社论说，一旦美国接受现实，“那么似乎就没有充分理由说明为什么阿联同美国进行友好合作的新纪元不能打开”。
