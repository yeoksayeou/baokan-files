Xinhua News Agency report: A giant coke oven with an annual production capacity of 450,000 tons of metallurgical coke was put into production at Anshan Iron and Steel on May 1st. The first batch of coke produced was of good quality. This is a major gift from the Anshan Iron and Steel builders for the "May Day" International Labor Day.

This coke oven is the eleventh coke oven that Anshan Iron and Steel has built and put into production since 1953. Its early commissioning is of great significance for realizing Anshan Iron and Steel's leap forward plan for steel production this year.

Our newspaper reports: The Wuhan Iron and Steel Company's large refractory material plant was partially put into production on April 28. The Wuhan Iron and Steel Refractory Material Plant is very large in scale, including five main production workshops for clay high-alumina bricks, dolomite, limestone, fire mud, and silica bricks. At present, the civil engineering of these workshops has been basically completed, and large equipment such as ball mills, mixers, and simple mills have also been installed. This refractory material plant can produce hundreds of thousands of tons of high-quality refractory materials every year, which can not only fully meet the needs of Wuhan Iron and Steel's blast furnaces, open-hearth furnaces, and coke ovens, but also support other industrial enterprises.

Our newspaper reports: The first 225-cubic-meter blast furnace of Anyang Iron and Steel Company in Henan Province has been basically completed and will soon be put into production.

After the completion of this medium-sized iron and steel complex, it will be able to produce 700,000 tons of iron, 600,000 tons of steel, and 500,000 tons of steel products annually. At present, its infrastructure construction has entered a tense stage of construction. In addition to the first blast furnace that is about to be put into production, the machine repair workshop and the central laboratory are in the final stages of construction. The rest are under intense construction.

Our newspaper reports: The No. 1 blast furnace of Nanchang Iron and Steel Plant, a newly built key iron and steel enterprise in Jiangxi Province, began tapping iron on May 1. After this 255-cubic-meter blast furnace is put into normal production, the daily output of pig iron will reach 300 to 350 tons.

At the commencement ceremony of this blast furnace, Fang Zichun, Secretary of the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, on behalf of the Provincial Committee, and Guo Guangzhou, Secretary of the Nanchang Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, on behalf of the Municipal Committee, warmly congratulated all employees and encouraged them to achieve new victories in production. After the meeting, Shao Shiping, Governor of Jiangxi Province, ascended the iron tapping yard of No. 1 blast furnace and cut the ribbon for the blast furnace's commencement. Amidst the applause and cheers of the guests and employees, bright red molten iron flowed from the tapping hole.

The construction of this blast furnace started on August 1 last year. At that time, there were certain difficulties in terms of equipment and technology in building such a blast furnace, but thanks to the specific leadership of the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Provincial People's Committee, and the mobilization of support from all parties, this blast furnace was finally successfully completed after more than half a year.

    钢铁阵容不断扩大
    鞍钢巨型焦炉已投入生产武钢耐火材料厂土建基本完工
    安阳首座中型高炉将建成南昌钢铁厂一号高炉开始出铁
    据新华社讯　一座年产四十五万吨冶金焦炭的巨型炼焦炉，于5月1日上午在鞍钢投入生产，炼出的第一炉焦炭质量良好。这是鞍钢建设者对“五一”国际劳动节的重大献礼。
    这座焦炉，是鞍钢从1953年以来陆续建成投入生产的第十一座焦炉。它的提前投入生产，对于实现鞍钢今年钢铁生产跃进计划有着很大意义。
    本报讯　武汉钢铁公司大型耐火材料厂已在4月28日部分投入生产。武钢耐火材料厂的规模很大，包括有粘土高铝砖、白云石、石灰石、火泥、矽砖等五个主要生产车间。现在，这些车间的土建工程都基本上完成，球磨机、搅拌机、简磨机等大型设备也安装好了。这座耐火材料厂每年可以生产几十万吨优质耐火材料，不仅能充分满足武钢高炉、平炉、焦炉的需要，还可以支援其他工业企业。
    本报讯　河南安阳钢铁公司的第一座二百二十五立方公尺的高炉已经基本建成，不久即将投入生产。
    这座中型的钢铁联合企业全部建成之后，每年能产铁七十万吨，钢六十万吨，钢材五十万吨。目前它的基建工程已进入施工的紧张阶段，除了第一座即将投入生产的高炉之外，机修厂房及中央实验室等正在进行结尾工程。其余都在紧张施工。
    本报讯　江西省新建的重点钢铁企业——南昌钢铁厂的第一号高炉，5月1日开始出铁。这座容积二百五十五立方公尺的高炉在转入正常生产以后，生铁日产量将达到三百吨到三百五十吨。
    在这座高炉的开工典礼大会上，中共江西省委书记方志纯代表省委，中共南昌市委书记郭光洲代表市委，分别向全体职工热烈祝贺，并且勉励他们在生产上取得新的胜利。会后，江西省长邵式平登上一号高炉出铁场，为高炉开工剪彩。在来宾和职工鼓掌欢呼声中，出铁口流出了鲜红的铁水。
    这座高炉是去年8月1日破土兴建的。当时建设这样一座高炉，在设备、技术等方面，都有一定的困难，但是由于中共江西省委和省人民委员会的具体领导，动员了各方面的力量支援，经过半年多时间，这座高炉终于胜利建成。（附图片）
