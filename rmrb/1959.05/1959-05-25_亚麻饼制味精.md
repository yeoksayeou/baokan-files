    MSG Made from Flaxseed Cake
    The Beijing Soy Sauce Factory has successfully trial-produced MSG using flaxseed cake, a byproduct of the Zhangjiakou Oil Factory. Every 100 jin of flaxseed cake can produce 6 jin of MSG, which is more than 20% higher than the yield from using soybean meal or soybean cake. Making MSG from flaxseed cake is easy to operate, and the raw material processing is relatively simple.

    亚麻饼制味精
    北京酱油厂利用张家口油厂的副产品——亚麻饼，试制味精成功。每百斤亚麻饼，可制取味精六斤，比用豆粕、豆饼制味精的产量还多20％以上。用亚麻饼制味精，操作容易，原料处理比较简便。
