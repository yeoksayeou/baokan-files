    The Communist Singers' Congress
    ——A Note on Attending the Third Soviet Writers' Congress
    By Our Correspondent Cui Yongchang
    The Third Soviet Writers' Congress, as the famous Ukrainian poet Bazhan said, can be called "the Communist Singers' Congress." These days, whether in the Kremlin's hall or on the lawns outside the venue, Soviet writers from 48 ethnic groups are talking freely about the bright prospects of communist construction and the glorious tasks of Soviet literature in the communist construction. Among the nearly 500 delegates attending the conference are contemporaries of Gorky, the founder of Soviet literature, and young writers attending the Writers' Congress for the first time. However, whether the older generation of writers or the young people who have just entered the literary ranks, they are now concerned and discussing the same issue: how to make Soviet literature better serve the cause of communist construction.
    This Writers' Congress is only a little over four years apart from the last one, but in these short four years, the Soviet Union's communist construction has achieved unprecedented results. Three artificial satellites went into the sky; the first cosmic rocket is revolving around the sun; a few months ago, the 21st Congress of the CPSU, held in the same place, passed the inspiring Seven-Year Plan. With the widespread development of economic construction, the spiritual outlook of the Soviet people has also changed. The flame of communist labor teams has spread throughout the country, and the will to fight for communism has reached an unprecedented high. In such a situation, the task of Soviet literature has become even more important. How writers can mobilize and use their genius works to contribute everything to communist construction is precisely the topic facing the congress.
    On the 18th, Surkov, the First Secretary of the Board of the Soviet Writers' Union, made a report entitled "The Tasks of Soviet Literature in Communist Construction." On the evening of the 18th, the congress began its discussions. One writer after another took the stage, expressing their opinions for the further prosperity of Soviet literature at this solemn and grand meeting. When the old Soviet writer, the author of the famous novel "Mother Volga," Panfilov, stepped onto the podium, he took out a shiny ore from his coat pocket and said to the delegates: "This ore was sent to me from Siberia, a place where the Decembrists once did hard labor. Not long ago, the Soviet people discovered countless iron ore, coal mines, oil, and diamonds here. The builders found the mine pits where the Decembrists worked and preserved them as cultural relics. Every time I see this ore, I feel very excited, because anyone who thinks about it will understand how enormous the historical significance of the events currently taking place in our country is! The enslaved labor of the Tsarist era has today become free, creative labor. And the task facing our writers is how to deeply understand the great significance of these events."
    Understanding the great significance of the current Soviet communist construction, reflecting the selfless labor of the Soviet people who are communist builders, expressing the heroic spirit of the working people, and using the example of heroic figures to educate the communist new generation can be said to be the central issues discussed at the meeting. Even during the preparations for the congress, many writers stated in articles published in newspapers and periodicals that creating works on modern themes is the primary task of Soviet writers. At the meeting, many speakers also unanimously stated that writers serving modern themes and revolutionary practice is a glorious tradition of Soviet literature. Many people pointed out in their speeches that Gorky's novel "Mother," Mayakovsky's long poem "Good!," Sholokhov's "Virgin Soil Upturned," Fadeyev's "The Young Guard," and Polevoi's "A Real Man" all depict the contemporary people's lives. These excellent works not only inspired millions of Soviet readers but also had a profound impact on world progressive literature. The poet Tikhonov wrote in the "Pravda" on the opening day of the congress: "The current tide of communist construction and people's lives is so magnificent that if a writer throws himself into this torrent, he will gain a strange power that will help him record the great achievements of the people in his works, and such works will last forever." Many speakers at the congress mentioned that the lives of the Soviet people are the source of inspiration for writers, and the working people who are fighting for communism should be the protagonists of Soviet literature.
    At this congress, it can be seen that Soviet writers paid great attention to the issue of improving the artistic level of their works. The famous Soviet poet Tvardovsky said: "In the new period of communist construction, Soviet writers should demand themselves with new standards, and improving the quality of literary works is an important task for writers." He called on writers to learn from Sholokhov and Marshak, strictly demand themselves, and create works that inspire the people.
    The Third Soviet Writers' Congress was convened under the circumstance of the increasing prosperity of Soviet multi-ethnic literature. In the big family of national unity in the Soviet Union, literary works are published in various languages. The literary works published by many republics and autonomous republics have today become the common spiritual wealth of all Soviet people. Now, the writers of all ethnic groups are gathered together at the congress, and of course, they talked about how to strengthen this friendly cultural exchange in the future. The Belarusian poet Brovka said: "If we recall the scene of our first meeting at the First Soviet Writers' Congress more than 30 years ago and compare it with the current situation, it will be very clear that the literature of each of our nations has made great achievements. However, the current possibilities have increased even more, so it is necessary to further strengthen the friendly ties between the writers of our nations."
    At this congress, many delegates emphasized in their speeches the importance of resolutely defending the principle of socialist realism. During the two congresses, Soviet writers showed their loyalty to the Soviet Communist Party and the Soviet people, and they fought against bourgeois ideology and revisionist views. The Soviet literary critic Rurikov criticized the Yugoslav revisionists' slander against Soviet literature in his speech. He said: "Yugoslav revisionists openly slander Soviet literature and Gorky, the founder of Soviet literature. This is a shameless attack. These revisionists do not know how sublime the name of Gorky is for Soviet writers and all progressive writers in the world." Many delegates at the meeting also believed that continuing the struggle against revisionism is an urgent task for Soviet writers.
    Representatives from fraternal countries and writers from other countries who were invited to attend the congress also spoke at the meeting. On the afternoon of the 18th, when Mao Dun, the head of the Chinese writers' delegation, stepped onto the podium, the delegates welcomed his speech with warm applause. When he said that "Soviet literature so strongly and deeply excites the hearts of Chinese readers, wins their sincere admiration, and inspires their fighting spirit," the delegates applauded warmly again. Other writers, whether it was Skala from Czechoslovakia or Hikmet, a Turkish poet, unanimously pointed out the great significance of Soviet literature in world literature. They unanimously pointed out that Soviet literature is a model of world progressive literature.
    At twelve o'clock noon on the 22nd, this was a moment that all the delegates who attended the congress could not forget. At this time, the leaders of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the CPSU arrived at the venue. The whole audience stood up unanimously and welcomed the central leaders headed by Khrushchev with thunderous applause. The old writer Tikhonov read aloud the congratulatory message from the Central Committee of the CPSU to the congress in his loud voice. This document evaluated the development of Soviet literature in the past period and gave important instructions on the tasks of writers in the future.
    Amidst warm applause, Khrushchev gave a two-hour speech to the congress. At the beginning of his speech, he read a poem written by a revolutionary worker, which expressed a revolutionary's praise for life and struggle. Khrushchev called on writers to describe the heroic figures in Soviet society. He said that writers should live among the people, and writers can't write anything if they are separated from life. Khrushchev finally said that Soviet writers should play the role of artillery in communist construction. These artillery should use their works to pave the way for communist construction and use their works to attack the enemy.
    The playwright Korneichuk expressed the common will of Soviet writers in his enthusiastic reply. He said: "I think I can express my heartfelt thanks on behalf of all the writers to the Central Committee of the CPSU for the care given to our multi-ethnic literature. Comrade Khrushchev's speech seems to have given us wings. After we leave the meeting, we must use our labor to create more and better works and complete the glorious task of the artillery team in communist construction."

    共产主义歌手的代表大会
    ——第三次苏联作家代表大会旁听记
    本报记者　崔永昌
    第三次苏联作家代表大会，正像乌克兰著名诗人巴然所说，可以称为“共产主义歌手的代表大会”。这几天，无论是在克里姆林宫的大厅里，或是在会场外面的草坪上，来自苏联四十八个民族的苏联作家侃侃而谈的全是共产主义建设的美好前景和苏联文学在共产主义建设中的光荣任务。参加会议的将近五百名代表中有苏联文学奠基者高尔基的同代人，也有第一次参加作家代表大会的青年作家，但是无论老一辈的作家还是刚刚走入文学队伍的青年，他们现在关心的和谈论的都是同一的问题：如何使苏联文学更好地为共产主义建设事业服务。
    这次作家代表大会与上一次代表大会相隔只有四年多的时间，但是在这短短的四年中间，苏联的共产主义建设事业取得了空前未有的成绩。三颗人造卫星上了天；第一颗宇宙火箭在围绕着太阳旋转；几个月前在这同一个地方召开的苏共第二十一次代表大会通过了震奋人心的七年计划。随着经济建设的广泛展开，苏联人民的精神面貌也起了变化，共产主义劳动队的火焰燃遍了全国，为共产主义奋斗的意志空前高涨。在这样的情况下，苏联文学的任务也就更加重大了，作家们怎样动员起来，用自己的天才作品为共产主义建设尽一切力量，这正是大会所面临的话题。
    18日，苏联作家协会理事会第一书记苏尔科夫作了题为“苏联文学在共产主义建设中的任务”的报告。18日晚上，大会便开始了讨论，一位位作家相继登上讲台，他们在这庄严隆重的会议上，为了苏维埃文学的进一步繁荣，发表了自己的意见。苏联老作家、名小说“伏尔加河母亲”的作者潘菲洛夫走上讲台时，从上衣口袋里拿出一块光闪闪的矿石，他向代表们说：“这块矿石是由西伯利亚寄给我的，那个地方曾经是十二月革命党人做苦工的地方。不久前苏联人民在这里发现了数量难以计算的铁矿、煤矿、石油和金刚石。建设者们找到了十二月革命党人工作过的矿坑，把它当作文物保存起来。每次当我看到这矿石时，我都感到非常激动，因为任何人只要想一想便会了解，目前在我国发生的事件有着多么巨大的历史意义！帝俄时代的奴役的劳动今天已经变成了自由的、创造的劳动。而我们作家面前的任务便是如何深入地在了解这些事件的伟大意义。”
    了解目前苏联共产主义建设的伟大意义，反映共产主义建设者苏联人民的忘我劳动，表现劳动人民英勇的精神面貌，用英雄人物的榜样教育共产主义的新人，这可以说是会议上讨论的中心问题。还在大会准备期间，许多作家在报刊上发表的文章中便肯定创作现代主题的作品是苏联作家的首要任务。在会议上许多发言人也一致表示，作家为现代主题和革命实践服务是苏联文学的光荣传统。许多人在发言中都指出，高尔基的小说“母亲”、马雅可夫斯基的长诗“好”、萧洛霍夫的“被开垦的处女地”，法捷耶夫的“青年近卫军”，波列伏依的“真正的人”，全是写当代人民生活的。这些优秀的作品，不但鼓舞了千千万万苏联的读者，并且对于世界进步文学起了深刻影响。诗人吉洪诺夫在大会开幕那一天的“真理报”上著文说：“目前共产主义建设和人民生活的巨浪是这样壮阔，如果作家投入这个洪流，那么他将得到一股奇异的力量，这力量会帮助他把人民的伟迹记入作品，这样的作品将永世长存。”大会上许多发言的人都谈到，苏联人民的生活是作家灵感的源泉，为共产主义奋斗的劳动人民应当是苏维埃文学的主角。
    在这次代表大会上，可以看到，苏联作家们对于提高作品艺术水平问题给予极大的注意。苏联著名诗人特瓦尔多夫斯基说：“在共产主义建设的新时期，苏联作家应当用新的尺度要求自己，提高文学作品质量是作家们的重要任务。”他号召作家们向萧洛霍夫和马尔夏克学习，严格地要求自己，创作出鼓舞人民的作品。
    第三次苏联作家代表大会是在苏联多民族文学日益繁荣的情况下召开的。在苏联这个民族友爱的大家庭里，用多种文字出版着文学作品。许多加盟共和国和自治共和国出版的文学作品今天已经成了全苏联人民的共同精神财富。现在，各民族的作家队伍在大会上汇集在一起，当然就谈起了今后如何加强这种友谊的文化交流的问题。白俄罗斯诗人布洛夫卡说：“如果我们回想一下三十多年前在第一次苏联作家代表大会上我们初次见面的情景与现在的情况比较一下，那就很清楚，我们每个民族的文学都取得了巨大的成绩。但是，现在的可能性更加增多了，因此就有必要更进一步加强我们各民族作家彼此间的友谊联系。”
    在这次代表大会上，许多代表在发言中都强调了坚决捍卫社会主义现实主义原则的重要性。在两次代表大会期间，苏联作家表现了对于苏联共产党和苏联人民的忠诚，他们对于资产阶级思想和修正主义观点进行了斗争。苏联文学批评家留里柯夫在发言中指责了南斯拉夫修正主义者对于苏联文学的诬蔑。他说：“南斯拉夫修正主义者公然诬蔑苏联文学和苏联文学的奠基者高尔基，这是无耻的攻击。这些修正主义者不晓得高尔基这个名字对于苏联作家以及世界所有进步作家有着多么崇高的意义。”会议上许多代表也都认为，继续进行反对修正主义的斗争是苏联作家的迫切任务。
    应邀参加此次大会的各兄弟国家代表和其他国家的作家也在会上发言，18日下午当我国作家代表团长茅盾走上讲台时，代表们用热烈的掌声欢迎了他的讲话。当他讲到“苏联文学是那样强烈而深刻地激动中国读者的心，赢得他们那样的衷心的敬仰，那样鼓舞他们的斗志”的时候，代表们再次热烈地鼓起掌来。其他的作家，无论是捷克斯洛伐克的斯卡拉，还是土耳其诗人希克梅特，都一致指出了苏联文学在世界文学中的伟大意义。他们一致指出，苏联文学是世界进步文学的典范。
    22日中午十二点，这是参加大会的所有代表不能忘掉的一个时刻，这时苏共中央主席团领导人来到了会场。全场的人一致起立，用雷鸣般的掌声欢迎以赫鲁晓夫为首的中央领导人。老作家吉洪诺夫用他宏亮的声音宣读了大会收到的苏共中央给大会的祝词。这个文件对于苏联文学过去一段期间的发展作了估价，并且对作家今后的任务作了重要指示。
    赫鲁晓夫在热烈的掌声中向大会作了长达两小时的讲话，他在讲话的开始部分，读了一首革命工人写的诗，这首诗表现了一个革命者对于生活和斗争的歌颂。赫鲁晓夫号召作家们描写苏联社会中的英雄人物。他说，作家应当生活在人民中间，脱离了生活，作家什么也写不出来。赫鲁晓夫最后说，苏联作家在共产主义建设中应当起一种炮兵的作用，这些炮兵应当用自己的作品为共产主义建设开辟道路，并且以自己的作品打击敌人。
    戏剧家考涅楚克在他的热情洋溢的答辞中表达了苏联作家的共同意志。他说：“我想，我可以代表所有的作家向苏共中央对于我们多民族文学给予的关心表示衷心的感谢，赫鲁晓夫同志的讲话好像给我们插上了翅膀，当我们离开会议以后，我们一定要用自己的劳动创作出更多更好的作品，完成共产主义建设中炮兵队的光荣任务。”
