Remembering Friends from Afar
    Du Pengcheng

    It has been more than half a year since I returned from my visit to Czechoslovakia. However, the impressions I gained in that beautiful country have only deepened with the passage of time, and they will forever remain the most beautiful part of my memories.

    I was once intoxicated by the beautiful scenery of Prague, breathing in the fresh air emanating from the Vltava River, and I lingered in the picturesque countryside and the magnificent industrial bases.

    When people want to study the amazing creations and ponder the merits of construction, they naturally turn their attention to the heroic working people.

    Speaking of people, the people of Czechoslovakia, I think of Julius Fučík. Because I am very familiar with Fučík, the hero of the working class, and his immortal works written with life and blood. But after I visited Fučík's homeland, I not only gained a deeper understanding of Fučík's heroic fighting spirit, but also learned that there are many heroes like Fučík in Czechoslovakia. They fought wave upon wave for the liberation of the Czechoslovak people, and were killed batch after batch by fascist bandits. However, life tells me that they are not dead; they are still at their various posts, illuminating and warming the world with the light and heat of their lives. During my travels in that beautiful country, I saw Fučík many times in factories, rural areas, government offices, schools, and on the defense lines. If you wish, you can call those many respectable and lovely people "Fučík-type" people. They are firm, simple, enthusiastic, and armed with lofty ideals and internationalist spirit. Among our people, you often see concern for the construction of Czechoslovakia and enthusiasm for studying the works of Gottwald, Zápotocký, and other outstanding fighters of the Czechoslovak people. And I, in Prague, in the district committees in remote areas, among government cadres and intellectuals, saw their concern for China's construction and their enthusiasm for studying the works of Comrade Mao Zedong. Just look at what a moving scene this is: when you go to visit a village far from Prague, you often encounter an ordinary farmer asking with great enthusiasm about China's construction and the details of people's lives; they shed tears of sadness when they hear about the past miserable life of the Chinese people, and rejoice when they hear about today's happy situation. Sometimes, an old milkmaid comes from afar to discuss a certain issue in Comrade Mao Zedong's works with you. She is so enthusiastic and focused that, in addition to being moved, you can imagine how deeply these ordinary working people think and explore the laws of life during their evening reading after work. I traveled to many places in Czechoslovakia, from east to west, from south to north, and saw many factories. In all the factories I visited, especially those famous machine manufacturing plants, many workers were working hard to complete orders for China. Some large wooden crates for packing machines were labeled: "Shipped to China!" Some factories had large banners posted on tall buildings: "Work hard to support China's socialist construction!" If you look at those veteran workers with glorious experiences, energetic young workers, and flower-like women standing next to the machines, you will know how consciously and actively these people are permeating our common cause with their sweat and wisdom.

    Just like in our country, in Czechoslovakia, you can see people's deep love and gratitude for the Soviet people wherever you go. Around June of last year, when I was visiting the Slovak region, a writer pointed to a high mountain in the distance and told me that in the winter of 1944, the Soviet Red Army, in order to help the bravely fighting Czechoslovak people and to finally defeat the Hitler bandits, began the famous Dukla Pass battle. The Hitler bandits deployed a large number of elite troops at the key points of the mountain, trying to prevent the Red Army from entering the Slovak region. Throughout the winter of 1944, the Dukla region was shrouded in artillery fire. It was not until January 1945 that the Soviet army finally crushed the stubborn resistance of the German fascist army and began the great march to liberate the entire Czechoslovakia. However, in the decisive and fierce battles fought in this area, nearly 80,000 Soviet Red Army soldiers shed their blood on the land of Dukla. One day, we went to a hilltop in the Bratislava urban area. Here, many tombstones were erected. These tombstones were erected for the officers of the Soviet Red Army who sacrificed their lives here. On this day, it was drizzling, and a vast fog shrouded the Danube River, the villages on the hillside, and the mountains and forests of Slovakia. However, some children braved the rain and placed bunches of fresh flowers in front of the graves of the Red Army soldiers with their red and tender little hands; some old mothers held their chins in their hands and stood silently in front of the graves for a long time, mourning the dead Soviet heroes. And I, standing in front of the graves on this hilltop, looking at the urban area and the surrounding scenery, seemed to witness that difficult era and the heroic battles. Indeed, China and Czechoslovakia are separated by more than 10,000 kilometers, but everything that happens here is extremely close and familiar to me. We exchanged everything for heroic struggles. Look, on the land of our socialist camp, there is a scene of enthusiastic construction everywhere, and people are working heroically to eliminate war and build a better life. I will always remember that unforgettable day we spent with the officers and soldiers of the Czechoslovak People's Army guarding the border line in the Bohemian Forest. Those heroic soldiers said: "We and the people of the fraternal countries are guarding the western gate of the socialist family, and you and the people of the fraternal countries are guarding the eastern gate of the socialist family." When I left this place, I could still hear the words the soldiers said to us when we said goodbye: "Although our two countries are separated by thousands of miles, our hearts are so close, and common ideals and common cause tightly link us together." I understand the soldiers; I know how great a truth of life their words contain.

    怀念远方的朋友
    杜鹏程
    我从捷克斯洛伐克访问归来，已经多半年了。但是，我在那美丽的国土上所获得的印象随着时间的消逝反而越来越深，而且，它将永远成为我记忆中最美好的一段。
    我曾经陶醉在布拉格优美的景色中，尽情地呼吸着维尔它瓦河散发出的清新空气，也曾在那如画的农村和雄伟的工业基地流连忘返。
    当人们要研究那惊人的创造，思索那建设的功勋的时候，自然而然地就把目光投到英勇劳动的人们身上。
    说到人，捷克斯洛伐克的人，我便想起了伏契克。因为，伏契克这位工人阶级的英雄以及他用生命和鲜血写成的不朽著作我是非常熟悉的。但是当我到了伏契克的祖国访问之后，不仅对伏契克英勇战斗的精神了解得更加深了，而且知道，像伏契克这样的英雄在捷克斯洛伐克是非常之多的。他们为了捷克斯洛伐克人民的解放事业，前仆后继地进行战斗，一批又一批地被法西斯匪徒杀死。但是，生活告诉我，他们没有死，他们还在各种工作岗位上，用生命的光和热，照耀和温暖着人间。我在那美丽的国土上游历时，在工厂、农村、机关、学校和国防线上，曾多次看到了伏契克。如果你愿意，就可以把那许许多多可敬而又可爱的人称为伏契克型的人。他们坚定、朴素、热情，而且是为那崇高的理想和国际主义精神武装起来的人。在我国人民中间，你时常看到人们对捷克斯洛伐克建设情况的关怀，看到对哥特瓦尔德、萨波托斯基，以及其他捷克斯洛伐克人民优秀战士的著作学习的热情。而我，在布拉格，在边远地区的区委会，在机关干部和知识分子当中，看到他们对中国建设情况的关心以及对毛泽东同志的著作研究的热烈情况。试看，这是一种怎样动人的景象：你到远离布拉格的某一个乡村去访问，常常会碰到一个普通农民怀着巨大的热情询问中国的建设情况和人民生活的详情；他们听到中国人民过去的悲惨生活，便凄然泪下，听到今天的幸福光景便欢欣鼓舞。有时候，一个挤牛奶的老太太，远道赶来，和你研究毛泽东同志著作中的某一个问题。她那么热情而专注，以致使你在感动之余能够想像到：这些普通的劳动人民在工作之余的夜读中，是如何深深地思索和探求生活规律。我在捷克斯洛伐克的土地上，从东到西，从南到北，走过许多地方，看到过很多工厂。凡是我到过的工厂，尤其是那些著名的机器制造厂，不少职工们在为完成中国的订货而努力工作。有些装机器的大木箱子上写着：“运往中国！”有的工厂的高大的建筑物上贴着大幅标语：“努力工作，支援中国的社会主义建设！”你再看看那些站在机器旁边的有着光荣经历的老工人、朝气勃勃的青年工人和花朵似的妇女，你就知道，这些人怎样自觉而积极地把自己的汗水和智慧渗透到我们的共同事业中。
    正像在我国一样，在捷克斯洛伐克，你走到任何地方，都可以看到人们对苏联人民深切的爱戴和感念。大约是去年6月，我在斯洛伐克地区访问时，一位作家指着远处的一座高山对我说，1944年冬季，苏联红军为了援助英勇奋战着的捷克斯洛伐克人民，为了最后击败希特勒匪徒，开始了著名的杜克拉战役。希特勒匪徒把大量精锐部队投放在山的要隘，想阻挡红军进入斯洛伐克地区。1944年整个冬季，杜克拉地区都在炮火笼罩中。直到1945年1月，苏军终于击溃了德国法西斯军的顽抗，开始了解放整个捷克斯洛伐克的大进军。但是在这一带进行的有决定性的炽烈战斗中，近八万名苏联红军战士的鲜血流在杜克拉的土地上了。一天，我们上了布拉迪斯拉发市区的一座山岗上。这里，建立了很多碑石。这些碑石都是为牺牲在此地的苏联红军的军官立的。这一天，正下着小雨，茫茫的雾气笼罩着多瑙河的山边的乡村，笼罩着斯洛伐克的群山和森林。但是，有些小孩冒着雨，用那红嫩的小手，把一束束鲜花放在红军战士的墓前；有些年老的母亲手托着下巴，长久地站在墓前向死去的苏联英雄默默致哀。而我，站在这山岗上的坟墓之前，望着市区和远近的景物，仿佛目睹了那苦难的时代和英勇的战斗。的确，中国和捷克斯洛伐克相隔一万余公里，但是这儿发生的一切，对我是至为亲切，至为熟悉的。我们用英勇的斗争换来了一切。看，我们社会主义阵营的土地上，到处都是一片热烈的建设景象，人们为了消灭战争，为了建设美好的生活而英勇劳动。我永远记得，在波希米亚大森林里的国境线上，我们和守卫捷克斯洛伐克的国防军的军官和战士们度过的那难忘的一天，那些英勇的战士们说：“我们和兄弟国家的人民守卫着社会主义大家庭西边的大门，你们和兄弟国家的人民守卫着社会主义大家庭东边的大门。”当我离开此地时，我耳边还响着战士们和我们告别时所说的话：“我们两国虽然相隔万里，但是我们的心却如此接近，共同理想和共同事业把我们紧紧地连结在一起。”我理解战士，我知道他们的话包含着多么巨大的生活真理。　写于捷克斯洛伐克国庆节
