To do economic work more and more meticulously, this "more and more meticulously" contains extremely rich content. From the perspective of planning, doing it more and more meticulously means doing it more and more able to correctly reflect objective laws and approach objective reality. From the perspective of organization, doing it more and more meticulously means doing it more and more practically; fully mobilizing the masses to discuss plans, propose measures, grasp the implementation of measures, grasp cooperation, grasp evaluation and competition, etc. Like the Pengpu Machine Factory in Shanghai, where leading comrades from the factory, workshops, and work sections go deep into the groups to specifically help the groups improve their work, and promptly summarize and exchange the work experience of the groups to improve the combat capabilities of the groups, this is much more "meticulous" than the previous leadership methods of the factory director grasping the workshop director, the workshop director grasping the work section leader, and the work section leader grasping the group leader. Of course, it goes without saying that only with meticulous leadership methods can meticulous work be done.

In any enterprise, there is a lot of leadership work. Setting directions, formulating plans, grasping production progress, solving key problems, caring about the lives of the masses, etc., are all very important and must be done well. However, to do these tasks well, it is not enough to stay in the office; you must go to the masses. However, in a factory with thousands or hundreds of people, it is impossible for the factory director and workshop director to directly grasp each one individually. It is necessary to rely on organization. The most important organization is the group. The production group in an enterprise is like a squad in the army, the most basic cell organization, and the most basic combat unit. The direction, policies, and tasks are all conveyed to the masses through the production group leader, and any opinions of the masses are often first reflected through the group leader. The production group leader is the closest to the masses, knows the masses the best, and knows the specific situation in production the best. Without helping the production group leader improve their leadership level, improve the group's work, and improve the group's combat capability, even if the leadership has a thousand or ten thousand brilliant strategies, they cannot be realized. Leading comrades from the factory, workshops, and work sections going deep into the group's experimental fields, participating in labor, and helping the production group leader improve their leadership level can meticulously and deeply mobilize every worker and better integrate production management into every worker and every machine tool. When workers are truly mobilized and the capabilities of the most basic combat units are strengthened, the plan can be truly implemented and reliable.

Leadership grasping the work of the group does not mean that leading comrades are required to replace the work of the group leader. The factory director is, after all, the factory director, and the workshop director is, after all, the workshop director. In addition to grasping the group, there is still much regular work to be done. Putting the production group leader aside and "overstepping one's authority" is not acceptable. In this regard, the experience of the Pengpu Machine Factory is worth learning. They mainly leverage the organizational role of the group and use the leadership method of grasping both ends (advanced and backward) to drive the middle, promoting the continuous advancement of each group.

Leading comrades should be decisive and good at making decisions. After the leading comrades of the enterprise go deep into the group and grasp the work of the group, they will have more opportunities to contact the masses, and their eyes will be brighter and their ears will be more sensitive. In this way, there will be more "planning" and the "decisions" will be "better". Therefore, grasping the work of the group not only improves the combat capability of the grassroots production organization, but also greatly benefits the improvement of leadership work.

### 到小组去

　　到小组去
    经济工作愈做愈细，这个“愈细”包含的内容丰富极了。从计划来讲，愈做愈细，就是愈做愈能正确反映客观规律，接近客观实际。从组织工作来说，愈做愈细，就是愈做愈落实；发动群众讨论计划、提措施、抓措施的实现、抓协作、抓评比竞赛等等，做得越充分。像上海彭浦机器厂那样，厂的、车间的、工段的领导同志，深入到小组中去，具体帮助小组改进工作，及时总结和交流小组工作经验，提高小组的战斗能力，比起以前厂长抓车间主任、车间主任抓工段长、工段长抓小组长的领导方法来，这就“细”得多了。当然不用说，只有用细致的领导方法，才能做出细致的工作。
    不论哪一个企业，领导工作都是很多的。定方针啦、订计划啦、掌握生产进度啦、解决关键问题啦、关心群众生活啦，等等，这些工作都很重要，都得做好。但是，要做好这些工作，关在办公室里是不行的，一定要到群众中去。然而，一个厂，几千几百个人，一个一个地全由厂长、车间主任直接去抓是不可能的。必须依靠组织。这最重要的组织，就是小组。企业里的生产小组，有如军队里的班，是最基层的细胞组织，是最基层的战斗单位。方针、政策、任务，都是通过生产小组长贯彻到群众中去，群众有什么意见也往往首先通过小组长反映上来。生产小组长是最接近群众，最了解群众，最了解生产中的具体情况的。不帮助生产小组长提高领导水平，改进小组工作，提高小组的战斗能力，纵然领导有一千个、一万个良谋妙计，也没法实现。厂的、车间的、工段的领导同志深入小组种试验田，参加劳动，帮助生产小组长提高领导水平，就能细致而深入地把每个工人发动起来，把生产管理工作更好地深入到每个工人、每台机床去。工人真正发动起来了，最基层的战斗单位能力加强了，就可以使计划真正落实、可靠。
    领导抓紧小组工作，决不是要求领导同志代替小组长工作。厂长毕竟是厂长，车间主任毕竟是车间主任，除了抓小组以外，还有许多经常工作要做。把生产小组长放到一边去，“越俎代庖”起来，那是不行的。在这一方面，彭浦机器厂的经验是值得学习的。他们主要是发挥小组的组织作用，并且运用抓两头（先进和落后）带中间的领导方法，推动各个小组不断前进。
    领导同志要多谋善断。企业的领导同志深入小组，抓紧小组工作以后，接触群众的机会就多起来了，眼睛更亮，耳朵更灵了。这样，“谋”也就比较多，“断”也就“善”了。所以，抓紧小组工作，不止能提高基层生产组织的战斗能力，而且对改进领导工作也大有好处。
