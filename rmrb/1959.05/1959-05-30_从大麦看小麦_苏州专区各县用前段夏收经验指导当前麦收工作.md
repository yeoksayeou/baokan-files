Looking at Wheat Through Barley
Suzhou Prefecture's Counties Use Experiences from the Previous Summer Harvest to Guide Current Wheat Harvest Work

(Our newspaper, Nanjing, 29th dispatch) The Suzhou Prefecture in Jiangsu Province is actively preparing to rush-harvest wheat.

While basically completing the harvest of one million mu of barley and naked barley, all localities are carrying out intense ideological mobilization and organizational work to rush-harvest wheat, to ensure a comprehensive bumper harvest of the three summer crops. The prefecture has over 2.8 million mu of the three summer crops, with wheat accounting for 64.7%, and all are required to be rush-harvested before and after the "Mangzhong" (Grain in Ear) solar term. The Suzhou Prefectural Party Committee and the county Party committees have specifically analyzed the situation of wheat harvesting this year: This period coincides with the plum rain season, so rain prevention measures must be thorough and effective to reduce germination and mildew and ensure that the grains are safely stored in barns; the prefecture has expanded early rice by 460,000 mu this year, and field management must be carried out for the planted early rice, and the more than 2 million mu of mid-season rice that is being planted must also be managed while planting. In short, harvesting, planting, and managing are carried out simultaneously. Therefore, the masses say: "The characteristic of this year's summer harvest is planting during harvesting and managing during planting." If not done well, one will lose sight of the other.

Wu County, Changshu, Jiangyin, Taicang, and other counties with larger wheat areas have universally paid attention to summarizing the experiences of rushing to harvest barley and naked barley, and plan to comprehensively promote and apply them when rushing to harvest wheat. These experiences are: (1) Grasp timely harvesting, harvest when 90% or 100% ripe, harvest one piece when it is ripe, to ensure full grains and avoid grain loss. (2) Set up indoor wheat threshing grounds so that threshing can continue on rainy days. The Qianjing People's Commune in Taicang County has set up more than 1,300 indoor wheat threshing grounds for rainy days. When harvesting barley and naked barley, indoor threshing is carried out on rainy days, reducing losses. (3) Mobilize the elderly and children to participate in wheat gleaning teams. The remuneration for the wheat gleaning teams is either calculated as work points according to the amount of work, or cash rewards are given. This practice is welcomed by the broad masses. (4) Build threshing grounds in the fields to reduce transportation labor and grain loss. Harvest early and late, and thresh at noon to speed up the turnover of the threshing grounds. These experiences are all effective methods, and are being promoted and applied in various localities.

In order to reasonably arrange agricultural work and reduce the contradiction of insufficient labor during the rush harvest of wheat, many places divide the late rice into batches for seedling raising and transplanting in batches, in order to alleviate the labor tension during the rush harvest of wheat. In addition, various localities are also carrying out small-scale cooperation between teams within the scope of the commune, adopting the method of exchanging labor for labor, and implementing equivalent exchange. This does not involve a large scope of labor force and is conducive to taking care of harvesting, planting and management in an all-round way.

In order to comprehensively do a good job in the summer harvest, the county Party committees and commune Party committees have strengthened the leadership of key areas and backward teams. The Party committees of the three communes of Bacheng, Ma'anshan, and Shipai in Kunshan County have dispatched more than 30 commune cadres and more than 100 brigade cadres to strengthen the leadership of backward teams. More than 70 township cadres and more than 600 brigade cadres in Meili, Xieqiao and other places in Changshu County, in order to strengthen the leadership of production teams, went deep into the small teams, ate, lived and worked with the commune members, and were both commanders, fighters, and propagandists, which greatly promoted the preparatory work for wheat rush harvest.

At present, the vast numbers of cadres and masses in Changshu, Jiangyin, Wu County, Wujiang, Kunshan, Taicang and other six counties in Suzhou Prefecture are confidently fighting this battle of rushing to harvest wheat, ensuring that the three summer crops achieve a comprehensive bumper harvest, and obtaining all the first batch of victorious fruits in 1959.

    从大麦看小麦
    苏州专区各县用前段夏收经验指导当前麦收工作
    本报南京29日电　江苏省苏州专区各地正在积极准备抢收小麦。
    各地在一百万亩大麦、元麦基本收割完毕的同时，紧张地进行抢收小麦的思想动员和组织工作，保证三麦全面地丰产丰收。全区三麦二百八十多万亩，小麦占64.7％，全部要求在“芒种”前后抢收完毕。苏州地委和各县县委具体分析了今年小麦收割时期的情况：这期间正值黄梅季节，防雨措施必需做得切实周到，才能减少发芽霉烂，保证颗粒归仓；全区今年扩大早稻四十六万亩，已栽的早稻要进行田间管理，正在栽插的中稻二百多万亩，也要边插边管。总之，收、种、管三项工作交错进行。所以群众说：“今年夏收的特点是收中有种，种中有管”，搞不好就会顾此失彼。
    小麦面积较大的吴县、常熟、江阴、太仓等县，都普遍注意总结了抢收大麦和元麦的经验，打算在抢收小麦时全面推广应用。这些经验是：（一）掌握适时收割，九成熟、十成收，熟一块、收一块，以保证籽粒饱满，避免掉粒。（二）设立室内打麦场，雨天可以继续脱粒。太仓县茜泾人民公社设立了一千三百多间雨天打麦场，在收获大麦元麦时，雨天室内脱粒，减少了损失。（三）发动老年人和儿童参加拾麦队。对拾麦队的报酬，有的按量计工分，有的是奖励现金，这种做法受到广大群众的欢迎。（四）田头建场，减少搬运劳力和落粒损失。早、晚收割，中午脱粒，以加快场地周转。这些经验都是行之有效的好办法，各地正在推广应用。
    为了合理安排农活，减少抢收小麦期间劳力不足的矛盾，好多地方把晚稻分批落谷，分批栽秧，以减轻抢收小麦时的劳力紧张。另外，各地还在公社范围内进行队与队之间的小型协作，采取以工换工的办法，实行等价交换。这样做劳动力的牵涉面不大，有利于收、种、管全面照顾。
    为了全面地做好夏收工作，各县县委和公社党委都加强重点地区和落后队的领导。昆山县巴城、马鞍山、石牌等三个公社党委抽派了三十几个社干部和一百多个大队干部去加强落后队的领导。常熟县梅李、谢桥等七十多个乡干部、六百多个大队干部，为了加强生产队领导，深入小队，与社员同吃同住同劳动，既是指挥员，又是战斗员、宣传员，对小麦抢收准备工作起了很大的推动作用。
    现在，苏州专区常熟、江阴、吴县、吴江、昆山、太仓等六个县的广大干部和群众正满怀信心地打好小麦抢收这一仗，保证做到三麦全面丰产丰收，把1959年第一批胜利果实全部拿到手。
