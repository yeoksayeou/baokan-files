Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, May 13th: Workers on Shanghai's industrial front are taking various measures to increase the production of raw materials and materials in accordance with the spirit of increasing production and practicing economy.

The iron and steel industry is an important raw material and material industry. In order to accelerate iron and steel production, Shanghai's new construction and expansion projects in the iron and steel industry have been listed as the key points of the city's current capital construction, and the construction progress is also the fastest. From January to April, the city's iron and steel industry capital construction projects have completed 45.7% of the annual planned investment. After the first blast furnace of Shanghai Iron and Steel Plant No. 1 was completed in mid-March, the second blast furnace will be ignited and put into operation within the month. After the large converter steelmaking workshop was built last year, another converter workshop has been started now. The large blooming mill workshop which is being newly built in Shanghai Iron and Steel Plant No. 3, has also entered the final stage. The growth of Shanghai's steel and steel production will better supply the needs of the whole country and Shanghai.

The most important goal of the chemical industry at present is to strive for high-quality and high-yield of the most basic chemical raw materials - "three acids and two alkalis". In the first four months of this year, the city's output of sulfuric acid and caustic soda has more than doubled compared with the same period last year. Since the end of last year, some light industrial and textile units have been able to meet about half of their own needs for chemical raw materials.

Scattered throughout the city, coke ovens are providing a large amount of coke for the iron and steel, machinery and other departments. Rapidly expanding coke production is a very important measure to overcome the difficulty of raw materials and materials. Since Shanghai launched a mass campaign to produce coke by indigenous methods in the second half of last year, more than half of the city's required coke by the end of the year could be self-supplied. This year, in addition to actively taking measures to improve the coking rate and quality of coke produced by indigenous methods, the city will also build a large-scale modern coke oven and dozens of simple coke ovens, striving to produce one million tons of coke this year. Exploiting and utilizing underground natural gas is also an important measure to increase the production of raw materials and materials. In the first quarter, more than 2,000 new gas wells were drilled in the city, with a maximum daily output of more than 50,000 cubic meters.

The stone quarrying team and sand dredging team composed of thousands of construction workers in Shanghai have recently gone to the mountains and beaches in Jiangsu and Zhejiang to quarry stone and dredge sand, in order to solve the supply of some building materials. In the past, most of the bricks and tiles used in Shanghai relied on the support of Dalian, Nanchang, Wuhan and other places. Since the Great Leap Forward last year, eleven counties in the suburbs of the city have successively made adobe and built kilns, taking materials locally. In the first quarter of this year, they produced more than 80 million bricks and more than 1.5 million tiles to support Shanghai's capital construction.

Waste bones left over from people's meals, worn-out shoes, old newspapers that have been read, broken glass bottles, and all kinds of scrap copper and scrap iron are important sources of industrial raw materials and materials. More than 10,000 waste product recycling workers, who are active in every corner of the city, have recovered more than 120,000 tons of waste products in the first four months of this year, providing a part of raw materials and materials for many industrial production departments.

### 贯彻增产节约精神  力促工业新的跃进  上海千方百计增产原材料

    贯彻增产节约精神  力促工业新的跃进
    上海千方百计增产原材料
    新华社上海13日电  上海市工业战线上的职工们根据增产节约的精神，正在采取各种措施，增加原料、材料的生产。
    钢铁工业是重要的原料、材料工业，为加速钢铁生产，上海市钢铁工业的新建扩建工程，被列为当前全市基本建设中的重点，并且建设的进度也最快。1到4月，全市钢铁工业基本建设工程已经完成全年计划投资额的45.7％。上钢一厂在3月中旬建成第一座高炉以后，第二座高炉月内又可点火开炉。这个厂去年建起了一个大型的转炉炼钢车间，现在又开工建设另一个转炉车间。上钢三厂正在新建的大开坯车间，也已进入结尾阶段。上海钢和钢材生产的增长，将更好的供应全国和上海的需要。
    化学工业当前最主要的努力目标，是力争最基本的化工原料——“三酸两碱”的优质高产。今年前四个月，全市硫酸和烧碱的产量已比去年同期增长一倍多。从去年年底以来，有些轻工业和纺织单位的工厂，自己生产的化工原料已经能满足本厂需要量的一半左右。
    散布在全市各个角落的炼焦炉，青烟袅绕，正在为钢铁、机械等部门提供大量的焦炭。迅速扩大焦炭的生产，是克服原料、材料困难的一项十分重要的措施。上海市从去年下半年掀起土法炼焦的热潮后，到年底全市需要的焦炭已有一半以上可以自给。今年全市除了积极采取措施提高土法炼焦的成焦率和质量外，还要建成一座产量很大的洋焦炉和几十座简易炼焦炉，争取今年生产焦炭一百万吨。开采利用地下的天然气，也是增加原料、材料生产的一项重要措施。第一季度，全市又新开凿了两千多口气井，最高日产量达到五万多立方公尺。
    上海市几千名建筑工人组成的采石队和捞沙队，最近已分赴江苏、浙江一带的山头和沙滩采石捞沙，解决一部分建筑材料的供应问题。过去，上海用的砖瓦大部分依靠大连、南昌、武汉等地支援。去年大跃进以来，市郊十一个县纷纷制坯建窑，就地取材，在今年第一季度生产了八千多万块砖和一百五十多万张瓦支援上海市基本建设。
    人们吃剩下的废骨，穿破了的鞋子，看过了的破旧报纸，打破了的玻璃瓶，以及各种各样的破铜烂铁，都是工业原料、材料的重要来源。活动在全市各个角落的一万多名废品回收工作人员，今年前四个月已回收了十二万多吨废品，为不少工业生产部门提供了一部分原料和材料。
