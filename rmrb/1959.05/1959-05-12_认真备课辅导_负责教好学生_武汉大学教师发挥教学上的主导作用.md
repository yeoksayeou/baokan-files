Wuhan University teachers, under the leadership of the Party, conscientiously prepare lessons, lecture, and tutor, playing a leading role in teaching and are deeply loved and respected by the students. A new type of teacher-student relationship characterized by mutual respect, love, and reciprocal learning has been formed in this school.

In order to teach students well, each department has established teaching groups, and teachers have generally strengthened lesson preparation. Before lecturing on a course, they must carefully prepare lessons, pre-lecture, and discuss, and repeatedly revise and supplement them before formally lecturing in the classroom. When lecturing, they also pay attention to stimulating students' independent thinking. Professor He Dingjie, who has taught for forty years, often prepares lessons late into the night, looking for various relevant materials to supplement the teaching content, and often incorporates the scientific research results from the experimental farm into the teaching, so that the teaching is closely integrated with production practice, which is welcomed by the students. Feng Wenquan, a young teacher in the Mathematics Department, understands the students' ideological situation and acceptance ability before lecturing, and listens to the students' opinions. After repeated research and preparation, he formally lectures, making it easier for students to understand thoroughly and boosting their enthusiasm for learning.

Because the teachers, under the leadership of the Party, conscientiously prepare lessons, lecture, and tutor, the students' academic performance has greatly improved this semester. According to statistics from the first and second grades of the Mathematics Department alone, excellent grades account for more than 80%. Fourth-year students in the Analytical Chemistry major of the Chemistry Department systematically and comprehensively learned spectral analysis, colorimetric analysis, and the application of ion exchange in analysis within three months. They mastered the complete analysis of steel, silicates, and some ores, and learned it very solidly and thoroughly, greatly improving their ability to work independently.

In the past, professors and lecturers generally did not tutor students' homework. Now, many professors go deep into the students to provide tutoring. Professor Yu Jiarong of the Mathematics Department often goes to the student dormitories and uses all his spare time to tutor, especially for some worker-peasant cadres or students with difficulties, he takes the initiative to enthusiastically find them and tutor them. The students are very moved by his spirit of "tirelessly teaching," and have twice posted big-character posters to commend him.

In order to better enable teachers to play a leading role in teaching, the school Party committee has helped and organized them to go to rural people's communes and industrial and mining enterprises, so that they can better connect with production practice and integrate with students, workers, and peasants. After the teachers of the Library Science Department went to the Xishui County People's Commune, they worked with the students to compile a series of books for the people's commune library based on the needs of the people's commune library, and wrote more than 200 papers, enriching the teaching content. In the process of compilation, the teachers fully played a leading role, and also absorbed the opinions and suggestions of the majority of students.

The students are deeply moved to see the teachers conscientiously preparing lessons and teaching responsibly. Many students actively put forward constructive opinions to help teachers do a good job in teaching, and their enthusiasm for learning has also greatly improved. Many classes have put forward the slogan "Never let anyone fall behind," and automatically formed groups to help each other and do a good job in learning. Under the premise of teaching well and learning well, and on the basis of common labor and common progress, teachers take the initiative to approach students, patiently guide students in their homework, and humbly listen to students' opinions. Students also respect and care for teachers more and help teachers improve. (Attached pictures)

    认真备课辅导　负责教好学生
    武汉大学教师发挥教学上的主导作用
    本报讯　武汉大学教师们在党的领导下，认真作好备课、讲课和辅导工作，在教学上发挥了主导作用，深受学生们的爱戴和尊敬。新型的尊师爱生、教学相长的师生关系，已经在这个学校里形成了。
    为了教好学生，各系成立了教学小组，教师们普遍加强备课工作，在讲授一门课程前，都要认真地进行备课、预讲和讨论，反复修改、补充后，再正式到课堂里讲课。讲课时，又注意启发学生的独立思考。教过四十年书的何定杰教授，经常备课到深夜，寻找各种有关资料来补充教学内容，还经常把实验农场里的科学研究成果充实到教学中去，使教学紧密结合生产实际进行，受到学生的欢迎。数学系青年教师冯文权，在讲课前了解学生的思想情况和接受能力，听取学生的意见，经过反复研究和准备后才正式讲课，使学生理解得比较透彻，学习的劲头也更大更足了。
    由于教师们在党的领导下，认真作好备课、讲课和辅导工作等，因此这学期学生的学习成绩有很大提高。仅据数学系一、二年级统计，优良成绩已占80％以上。化学系分析化学专业四年级学生，在三个月内就比较系统、全面地学习了光谱分析、比色分析和离子交换在分析上的应用，掌握了钢铁、硅酸盐和部分矿石的全分析，而且学得很巩固、透彻，大大提高了独立工作的能力。
    过去教授和讲师一般是不去辅导学生作业的。现在，许多教授都深入到学生中进行辅导了。数学系教授余家荣经常到学生宿舍中，利用一切空闲时间辅导，特别对一些工农干部或有困难的学生，更是主动热情地找上门去辅导。学生们对他这种“诲人不倦”的精神，十分感动，曾两次写大字报表扬他。
    学校党委为了更好地发挥教师在教学中的主导作用，曾帮助和组织他们到农村人民公社、工矿企业部门去，让他们更好地联系生产实际，与学生、工农群众相结合。图书馆学系的教师下到浠水县人民公社以后，就和学生们一起，根据人民公社图书馆的需要，编成了人民公社图书馆丛书，写出了二百多篇论文，丰富了教学内容。在编写过程中，教师充分发挥了主导作用，同时也吸取了广大学生的意见和建议。
    学生们看到教师们认真备课、负责教学，都深为感动，许多学生积极地提出建设性意见，帮助教师搞好教学，学习积极性也大大提高了。不少班提出“决不让一人掉队”的口号，自动地成立小组，互相帮助，搞好学习。在教好、学好的前提下，在共同劳动、共同进步的基础上，教师主动地接近学生，耐心地指导学生作业，虚心听取学生的意见，学生也更加尊敬和关心教师，帮助教师提高。（附图片）
