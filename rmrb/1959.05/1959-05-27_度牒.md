    Ordination Certificate
    Liu Mianzhi
    In the fourth chapter of *Water Margin*, after Lu Da killed Zhen Guanxi with three punches, he fled from Weizhou (now Pingliang, Gansu) to Yanmen County in Daizhou (now Yanmen, Shanxi). Because the government drew portraits and posted notices everywhere, the arrest was urgent, so he had to become a monk at Mount Wutai, and was given the Dharma name Lu Zhishen. From then on, the temple had one more monk, but the secular world lost one criminal and fugitive military officer. The case of killing Zhen Guanxi was closed because there was nowhere to investigate.
    Before Lu Da became a monk, Zhao Yuanwai said to him, "I have already bought an ordination certificate of five colors here." Logically speaking, the ordination certificate is the identity card of a monk, and should be filled out by the temple that tonsures him. How could Zhao Yuanwai buy an ordination certificate at home before Lu Da became a monk? Moreover, since the ordination certificate is the identity card of a monk, how can it be bought and sold? Who is the seller?
    It turns out that in the Song Dynasty, ordination certificates could be bought and sold, and the seller was the central government of the Song Dynasty. In 1067 AD, the Song Dynasty government began to sell ordination certificates, and continued to sell them until the fall of the Song Dynasty. In these two hundred years, the money earned from selling ordination certificates occupied an important position in the government's income. The price of an ordination certificate varied depending on the time and place. For example, during the reign of Emperor Shenzong of the Song Dynasty, the official price was 130,000 cash per certificate, but in Kuizhou Road it was sold for 300,000 cash, and in Guangxi Road it was sold for 650,000 cash. (Song Hui Yao Manuscript 67, 140.) At that time, the price of rice in the Central Plains was only 70 to 100 cash per *dou* (Li Tao's *Xu Zizhi Tongjian Changbian* 251, 252, *Song Hui Yao Manuscript* 122.), and each ordination certificate was equivalent to about 130 to 140 *shi* of rice. In the Southern Song Dynasty, each ordination certificate was sold for 120 to 800 *guan* or converted to 150 to 300 *shi* of rice. (Song Hui Yao Manuscript 62, 96, Zhu Xi's *Zhu Wengong Ji* 16.)
    Ordination certificates were so expensive, who could afford them? Of course, only wealthy people like Zhao Yuanwai.
    Having bought an ordination certificate, one can only become a monk or a Taoist priest. What are the benefits? Spending so much money to become a monk shows that the common people at that time, and even some landlords, were better off being monks or Taoist priests.
    Needless to say, the common people, the burden on the people in the Song Dynasty was particularly heavy. Monks and Taoist priests eat from all directions, and temples have fields. Becoming a monk or Taoist priest meant not having to serve in the military, perform corvee labor, or pay head taxes and other exorbitant taxes, escaping the government's exploitation and eating a free meal, becoming a legal vagrant who does not work.
    What about the landlords? Although to the peasants, they were exploiters and very powerful, there were also contradictions within the landlord class. Because landlords were also divided into officials and commoners, landlords who were also officials had power and influence, and were official households. As for non-official households, in order to protect their family property, they had to try every means to become official households, wanting their children to study and become officials through the imperial examinations. If that was not possible, they would have to spend money to buy an official title, becoming an official household in name. At that time, official titles could also be bought with money, but they were more expensive than ordination certificates. If not, buying an ordination certificate would also be good, because temple fields were exempt from rent and taxes. (Zhao Yi's *Notes on the Twenty-Two Histories* 19, Yu Zhengxie's *Gui Si Draft* 13.)
    In addition, there were many other benefits, such as monks and Taoist priests receiving preferential treatment in law. The Song Dynasty law stated: "Monks, nuns, Taoist priests, and female Taoist priests, civil and military officials below the seventh rank, are allowed to reduce their sentences if they are guilty" (*Changbian* 97).
    If one committed a major crime such as murder, becoming a monk was an effective way to escape legal sanctions. In ancient times, there was no photography, and most people had long hair. The arrest warrants could only say whether the person had a yellow or black face, with or without a beard. A military officer like Lu Da, after shaving his head and beard, changing into a *kasaya*, and leaving his hometown, would be difficult for strangers to recognize. Similarly, in the book, Wu Song killed fifteen people in Mandarin Duck Tower. At Zhang Qing's vegetable garden in the Crossroads Slope, he obtained an ordination certificate with a similar age and appearance, then cut his hair, covered the golden seal tattooed on his face, and dressed as a mendicant, going to Erlong Mountain to become an outlaw. Although arrest warrants were posted everywhere, "Wu Song had already become a mendicant, and no one interrogated him on the road." It can be seen that the ordination certificate was very useful for murderers and criminals.
    Precisely because of this, the Song Dynasty government sold ordination certificates on a large scale, making it a way to make money. Not only selling them, but sometimes even forcing people to buy them.
    The ordination certificates of the Northern Song Dynasty were printed with woodblocks on yellow paper. It was not until the third year of Jianyan in the Southern Song Dynasty (1129 AD) that they were changed to be woven from silk, and the weaving agency was the Shaofu Jian Wensi Yuan, the same place that wove official titles. The five-colored ordination certificate mentioned in *Water Margin* was actually a matter of the Southern Song Dynasty.
    From the matter of buying ordination certificates, *Water Margin* truthfully reflects the historical facts of the Song Dynasty.

### 度牒

    度牒
    刘勉之
    水浒传第四回写鲁达三拳打死了镇关西以后，从渭州（今甘肃平凉）逃到代州雁门县（今山西雁门），因为官府画影图形，到处张贴榜文，缉捕很急，只好在五台山出家当了和尚，起个法名叫鲁智深。从此，寺院里多了一个和尚，在俗世却少一个犯罪逃亡的军官，打死镇关西这一案子由于无处追查，便此了结。
    在鲁达出家之前，赵员外对他说：“已买下一道五花度牒在此”。照常理说，度牒是出家人的身份证，应该由替他剃度的寺院填给，怎么鲁达在没有出家之前，赵员外的家里就买了一道度牒呢？而且度牒既是出家人的身份证，又怎么可以买卖呢？卖主又是谁呢？
    原来在宋朝，度牒是可以买卖的，卖主是宋朝中央政府。公元1067年宋朝政府开始出卖度牒，一直卖到宋亡。在这两百年中，卖度牒所得的钱在政府收入中占有重要地位。一道度牒的价格因时因地不等，如宋神宗时官价每道卖钱一百三十千，但在夔州路则卖到三百千，广西路则卖到六百五十千。（宋会要稿六十七，一百四十。）当时中原一带米价每斗不过七、八十文至一百文，（李焘续资治通鉴长编二五一，二五二，宋会要稿一二二。）每道度牒折合米约在一百三、四十石以上。南宋时每道度牒卖钱一百二十贯至八百贯或折米一百五十石至三百石。（宋会要稿六十二，九十六，朱熹朱文公集十六。）
    度牒这样贵，什么人才能买得起？当然只有财主赵员外那样的人了。
    买了度牒，只能出家当和尚，当道士，有什么好处？花这么多钱出家，说明当时的老百姓，以至部分地主，不如当和尚、道士好。
    老百姓不必说了，宋代人民负担特别重，和尚道士吃十方，寺院有田产，当了和尚、道士就不必服兵役，劳役，不出身丁钱米和其他苛捐杂税，逃避了政府的剥削，吃一碗现成饭，成为不劳而食的合法的游民。
      地主呢？虽然对农民来说，他是剥削者，很神气。但在地主阶级内部来说，也有矛盾。因为地主也有官民之分，地主而又作了官的就有权有势，是官户。至于非官户的地主，为了保全身家财产，得想尽一切办法巴成官户，要子弟读书中进士作官，如不行，也得出钱买官告，成为名义上的官户，当时官告也可以用钱买，但比度牒更贵，再不，就买张度牒也好。因为寺院田产是可以免租赋的。（赵翼二十二史札记十九、俞正燮癸已稿十三。）
    此外，还有许多好处，如和尚、道士在法律上受优待，宋代法律：“僧尼道士女冠，文武官七品以下者，有罪许减赠”（长编九七）。
    如果犯了杀人大罪，出家便是逃避法律制裁的有效手段。古时候还不会照相，一般人都留长头发，缉拿榜文上只能说这人脸黄脸黑，有须无须，像鲁达那样的军官，剃了头发，胡子，改穿袈裟，离开了本乡本土，外地生人便很难辨认出来了。又如同书武松在鸳鸯楼杀了十五条人命，在十字坡菜园子张青家得了一张年龄像貌相当的度牒，便剪了头发，披在脸上遮盖刺的金印，装作行者模样，一路上二龙山去落草。虽然到处张挂榜文要逮捕他，可是“武松已自做了行者，于路却没人盘诘他。”可见度牒对杀人犯罪来说是很顶事的。
    正因为如此，宋朝政府就大卖度牒，成为生财之道。不但出卖，有时候还要强迫摊派呢。
    北宋的度牒是雕板用黄纸印的。到南宋建炎三年（公元1129）才改用绫绢织造，织造的机关是少府监文思院，和织造官告同一个地方。水浒传所说的五花度牒，实际上是南宋的事。
    从买度牒这一件事来说，水浒传是真实地反映了宋代的历史事实的。
