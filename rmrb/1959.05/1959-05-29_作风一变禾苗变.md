A Change in Style Transforms Seedlings
Lin Ying, Secretary of the Communist Party Committee of Lingshan Commune

As long as we closely rely on the masses, Type Three seedlings can definitely be eliminated. The fact that cadres of the Dongtou Production Brigade of the Lingshan Commune in the suburbs of Haikou City, Hainan Island, implemented the mass line and changed the backward state of production is a powerful demonstration of this.

The natural conditions in the Dongtou Brigade are very good; it is a key rice-producing team in the Lingshan Commune. The soil here is sandy loam, suitable for rice cultivation, and it also faces the Nandu River, making irrigation and drainage convenient. Furthermore, its proximity to the city ensures a relatively abundant source of fertilizer. However, production work has lagged far behind. Due to a general lack of base fertilizer and the failure to effectively manage the fields after transplanting, the seedlings recovered slowly, with short stems and leaves. Some early transplants even showed signs of branch and stem yellowing, and rice blast, leaf roller disease, and excessive vegetative growth became increasingly serious. Of the brigade's 1,350 mu of paddy fields, Type Three seedlings accounted for more than 80%. After two consecutive evaluations, they were criticized. Faced with this situation, many people lacked confidence in achieving a bumper early rice harvest, feeling that there was little hope for this crop. The production situation seemed bleak. However, under the criticism and urging of other fraternal teams, this brigade finally identified the reasons for its backwardness and mobilized the masses to improve field management. As a result, by the time of flowering and heading, all Type Three seedlings had been eliminated, and Type One seedlings were consolidated. Now the rice seedlings are growing robustly, and despite several typhoons, there has been no lodging.

One of the important reasons why the Party branch of the Dongtou Brigade was able to reverse this backward situation was that the cadres improved their leadership style and followed the mass line. At that time, in the face of a large number of Type Three seedlings, many cadres were discouraged. Instead of thinking positively, they pessimistically worried that yields would be reduced and they would be criticized and resented by the masses. In response to this situation, the Party branch organized a democratic discussion among cadres and activists to unify everyone's understanding of the production situation and criticize the pessimistic and disappointed sentiments among the cadres. Then, the problem was turned over to the masses for discussion: Can the backwardness in production now be reversed? How can Type Three seedlings be rescued? In the discussion, the masses not only proposed many ways to rescue Type Three seedlings, but also frankly pointed out that some cadres did not have good contact with the masses, rarely participated in production or never participated in production, did not understand the production situation, and often made wrong ideas in their work. This was an important reason why past work was not done well. This criticism from the masses was entirely correct. Of the 27 cadres above the small team level in this brigade, except for the ten female cadres who regularly participated in production, the rest rarely participated in production, so that many problems were not effectively and promptly resolved, leading to confusion such as wasted labor and improper arrangement of farm work. The brigade's leading cadres accepted the criticism from the masses and resolutely corrected their past shortcomings. The thirteen members of the branch were each responsible for a specific field, and the brigade cadres arranged work, meetings, and labor to ensure that each person participated in labor for eight hours a day. After doing this, the relationship between cadres and the masses became closer, and various problems were resolved promptly and meticulously. Wu Duokun, the branch secretary, used to be busy with meetings and rarely went to the village to participate in labor. This time, after he went down to the relatively poor Erfengcun small team, he listened carefully to the opinions of the masses and quickly learned about the problems in the work. He found that more than 100 mu of fields in this small team were flooded too deeply to be drained, but the cadres still wanted the commune members to apply fertilizer. Wouldn't applying fertilizer like this be a waste of effort? Wu Duokun convened a meeting of commune members, first making a self-criticism and expressing his welcome for everyone's criticism, resolving to improve his shortcomings. Seeing that the cadres were sincerely trying to do a good job, the commune members' enthusiasm was boosted. They said that past work had not been done well, and they could not just blame the cadres; the commune members also had a responsibility. Everyone offered ideas and suggestions. The meeting went on until late at night, and the commune members' spirits were still high.

With the improvement of the cadres' style and the solidness of the work, field management was done in a timely and meticulous manner. On this basis, the Dongtou Brigade adopted a method of combining cadres, peasants, and technicians to identify Type Three seedlings plot by plot and fully mobilize commune members to offer opinions and suggestions. Different measures were taken for Type Three seedlings depending on the circumstances: for acidic fields with too much water, rust, black roots, and yellow leaves, in addition to ditching to drain waterlogged areas and properly drying the fields, 200 jin of lime mixed with wood ash were applied to neutralize the acidity; another type of Type Three seedling was found in shallow fields lacking water, requiring deeper cultivation during hoeing and attention to preventing lodging. For the 20% of Type Two seedlings, 30 dan of human and animal manure were applied after each weeding. At that time, although there were very few Type One seedlings, they did not relax management either. After continuous hard work, the backward state of production changed, Type Three seedlings were constantly reduced, and Type One seedlings were continuously increased and consolidated. After the third fertilization, all Type Three seedlings, accounting for 80% of the total area, were eliminated and the vast majority were promoted to Type One seedlings.

The victory in field management laid the foundation for a bumper harvest and further stimulated the commune members' production enthusiasm. Now this brigade has shown a vigorous new atmosphere in production.

    作风一变禾苗变
    中共灵山公社委员会书记　林应
    只要紧密依靠群众，三类禾一定能消灭。海南岛海口市郊区灵山公社东头生产大队的干部贯彻执行群众路线，改变生产落后面貌的事实，就是一个有力的证明。
    东头大队的自然条件很好，是灵山公社的水稻重点队。这里的土壤是宜于水稻生长的沙质壤土，同时又面临南渡江，排灌方便，加上接近城市，肥源也比较充足。但是生产工作却大大落在后头。由于基肥普遍不足，插秧以后又没有切实抓好田间管理，因此秧苗回青缓慢，茎叶短小，一些早插的甚至已经枝节枯黄，而且稻热病、卷叶病、徒长病越来越厉害。全队一千三百五十亩稻田，三类禾占了八成以上。一连两次评比，都受到批评。在这种情况面前，不少群众对争取早稻大丰收信心不足，觉得这一造没多大希望了。生产局面显得一片沉闷。但是，在各兄弟队的批评和督促下，这个大队终于找出落后的原因，发动群众，搞好田间管理。结果，到扬花抽穗的时候，全部三类禾被消灭了，一类禾也巩固了。现在稻苗生长茁壮，尽管受了几次风雨的侵袭，没有发生倒伏现象。
    东头大队的党支部能够扭转这种落后局面的重要原因之一，是干部改进了领导作风，走了群众路线。当时，在大量的三类禾苗面前，有许多干部泄气了，他们没有从积极方面去想法，而是消极地耽忧将来减了产，自己会挨批评，受到群众埋怨。针对这种情况，党支部便在干部和积极分子中，组织了一次民主讨论，统一大家对生产形势的认识，批判了干部中那种悲观失望情绪。然后，把问题交给群众去讨论：现在生产落后了能不能挽回？怎样才能挽救三类禾？在讨论中，群众不但提出许多挽救三类禾的办法，而且更坦率地指出：部分干部没有很好联系群众，很少参加生产或从未参加生产，不了解生产情况，在工作中常常出错主意。这是过去工作做得不好的重要原因。群众的这个批评是完全正确的。这个大队的小队以上干部二十七人，除了十个女干部经常参加生产以外，其余的都很少参加生产，以致许多问题没有得到切实的及时的解决，出现了浪费劳动力、农活安排不当等混乱现象。大队领导干部接受了群众的批评，坚决改正了过去的缺点。支部的十三个委员分别包干负责一个田坑，大队干部把工作、开会、劳动做了安排，保证每人每天有八小时参加劳动。这样做了以后，干部和群众的关系进一步密切起来，解决各种问题也及时而又细致了。支部书记吴多昆以前老是忙于开会，很少下村参加劳动。这次，他下放到生产较差的二冯村小队去以后，认真听取群众意见，很快就了解到工作上存在的问题。他发现这个小队有一百多亩田水浸得太深，排不出去，但干部还是要社员施肥。这样下肥，不是白费劲吗？吴多昆召集社员开会，自己先作了检查，表示欢迎大家批评，决心改进缺点，社员见到干部确是诚心诚意要把工作搞好，劲头就鼓起来了。他们说，过去工作搞得不好，不能光怪干部，社员也有责任。大家纷纷献计献策。会议开到深夜，社员情绪还很高。
    干部作风改善了，工作踏实了，田间管理也就做得适时和细致。东头大队在这个基础上，又采用干部、农民、技术员三结合的办法，逐块鉴定三类禾，并且充分发动社员提意见，献计谋，根据不同的情况对三类禾采取不同的措施：一种是水多生锈、根黑叶黄的酸性田，除了开沟排除渍水、适当晒田以外，还追施二百斤石灰混合草木灰以中和酸性；另一种三类禾是缺水的浅脚田，中耕时要深些，要注意防倒伏。对于占20％的二类禾，每次除草以后，下人畜肥三十担。那时，一类禾虽然极少，但他们也不放松管理。经过连续苦战，生产落后的面貌改变了，三类禾不断减少，一类禾不断增加和巩固。第三次施肥以后，占总面积80％的三类禾全部消灭了，绝大部分升为一类禾。
    田间管理的胜利奠定了丰收的基础，也进一步激发了社员的生产热情。现在这个大队在生产上已经显示出蓬蓬勃勃的新气象。
