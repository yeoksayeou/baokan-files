Budapest, May 24th (Reporter Wang Chongjie) - At nine o'clock in the morning on May 23rd, the Budapest West Railway Station was unusually lively. The first group of Hungarian travelers to visit China this year were enthusiastically discussing the great achievements of New China in socialist construction, and the astonishing miracles created by more than 600 million people in the Great Leap Forward... Yes, although Hungary and China are separated by thousands of mountains and rivers, their common ideals closely link the hearts of the people of the two countries.

Dr. Dukoi Ferencz, Deputy Professor of Chinese Classical Literature at Budapest's Eötvös Loránd University, told reporters that he loves the long-standing, rich, and colorful Chinese classical literature, and he loves even more the great reality created by the Chinese people under the leadership of the Communist Party. He is extremely excited to be able to see the tremendous changes taking place in China with his own eyes. The poet and translator Vörös Sándor and his wife have translated poems by Qu Yuan, Du Fu, Bai Juyi, Guo Moruo, and Tian Jian, and the collection of poems by Comrade Mao Zedong, which they participated in translating, will soon be published. They hope that this trip will help them to introduce Chinese literature and strengthen Hungarian-Chinese friendship in the future. Sásdi Sándor is a writer known for writing about rural life, and he is particularly interested in China's people's communes. The smiling faces of the white-haired Dr. Sándor László and his wife expressed their inner joy. They said that traveling to China is a great joy for them. Chinese medicine and the creativity of the Chinese people have long attracted them.

Today, the first group of twenty-one people are traveling to China. In a few days, two more groups of Hungarian friends will travel to China one after another.

Recently, Chinese travelers to Hungary will also arrive in Budapest. At the station to see off the travelers, Deputy Minister of Posts and Telecommunications and Transportation, Földvári László, in his farewell speech, entrusted these envoys of friendship to convey the Hungarian people's love and friendship for China to their Chinese brothers.

At ten o'clock, the train carrying the travelers sped towards the east. In order to reach China as soon as possible, they will transfer to a plane to Beijing in Moscow.
