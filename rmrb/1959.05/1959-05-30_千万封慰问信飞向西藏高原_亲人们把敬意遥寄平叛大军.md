Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 29th. Tens of thousands of letters of condolence sent from all over the country to the People's Liberation Army troops quelling the rebellion have flown to the Tibetan Plateau like snowflakes. On snow-capped mountains at altitudes of five or six thousand meters, and on the way to Shannan, when officers and soldiers read the letters of condolence from their compatriots from all over the country, they felt extremely warm and received tremendous encouragement.

Among the countless letters of condolence, many came from the distant Fujian front. The soldiers of the "Red Flag Class" of the Sixth Company of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army on the Fujian front, who had won twenty-five red flags successively, said in their letter of condolence: You have basically eliminated the bandits in a short period of time, rescued the deeply suffering Tibetan compatriots, and made great contributions to the unification of the motherland. Not only do the Tibetan compatriots sincerely thank you, but the people of the whole country and we also admire you very much.

All the Zhuang, Yao, and Miao employees of the Nanning City Post and Telecommunications Bureau wrote in their letter of condolence: "We personally experience that the Party's ethnic policy is incomparably brilliant. Take ourselves as an example, before liberation, we didn't even dare to admit that we were Zhuang. After liberation, we lived a happy life in the big family of ethnic unity. When we think of this, we also think of you..."

All the employees of the Industry Bureau of the Ganzi Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture in Sichuan Province expressed their heartfelt gratitude and cordial condolences to the troops quelling the rebellion for quickly putting down the Tibetan rebellion. The letter of condolence said: "All of us unanimously assure the Party that we will support you wholeheartedly with practical actions to do our work well."

Medical staff of the Stomatology and ENT departments of the People's Hospital of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region said in their letter of condolence: "You have successfully quelled the rebellion in a short period of time. We celebrate this victory and extend our highest salute to you!"

These many letters of condolence brought the care of the people all over the country to the troops quelling the rebellion, greatly encouraging the soldiers. Liu Jinhe, a soldier of a certain company, suffered frostbite in both legs when crossing the snow-capped mountains, making it painful to walk. The company commander wanted him to stay behind. However, when Liu Jinhe was resting, a letter of condolence from the students of Chengdu No. 11 Middle School was delivered to his hand. Liu Jinhe read: "Dear uncles: When we heard the news that the uncles quickly put down the Lhasa rebellion and achieved great victories in the Shannan area, our hearts flew to the plateau, flew to the Himalayas, flew to the uncles' side... Your achievements will encourage us to study harder..." After reading the letter, Liu Jinhe couldn't sleep all night. He thought, the children care about me so much, can't I overcome even the difficulty of frostbite in my legs? So, the next day he resolutely set off with the team to pursue the remnants of the bandits. Not only did he not fall behind, but he also helped other soldiers carry guns and belongings. Later, in a battle, he captured three bandits.

In the battle to pursue and wipe out the remnants of the bandits during the thousand-mile march, some companies encountered extremely difficult situations while crossing icy rivers, snow-capped mountains, and grasslands day and night. At this time, the soldiers often recited the letters of condolence sent by their compatriots. Some time ago, the soldiers often ate fried noodles mixed with snow due to lack of water during marching and combat. They optimistically sang: "Eating fried noodles on the plateau, put white sugar (referring to snow) inside. The Tibetan compatriots are liberated, and the soldiers are very happy."

### 千万封慰问信飞向西藏高原  亲人们把敬意遥寄平叛大军

    千万封慰问信飞向西藏高原  亲人们把敬意遥寄平叛大军
    据新华社拉萨29日电　从祖国各地寄给人民解放军平叛部队的成千上万封慰问信，像雪片似的飞到了西藏高原，在海拔五、六千公尺的雪山上，在进军山南的途中，官兵们一读到祖国各地的亲人们给他们慰问的信件，都感到无比的温暖，得到巨大的鼓舞。
    在无数的慰问信中，有许多是来自遥远的福建前线。曾先后获得二十五面红旗的福建前线解放军某部六连的“红旗班”的战士们在慰问信中说：你们在短期内把叛匪基本肃清，解救了灾难深重的西藏同胞，为祖国的统一立下了伟大的功勋，不但藏族同胞衷心感谢你们，全国人民和我们也万分崇敬你们。
    南宁市邮电局全体僮、瑶、苗族职工在慰问信中写道：“我们亲身体会到党的民族政策是光辉无比的。拿我们本身来说，解放前，连自己是僮族的都不敢承认。解放后，在民族团结的大家庭中，我们才过着幸福的生活。当我们想到这里，也就想到你们……。”
    四川省甘孜藏族自治州工业局全体职工对平叛部队迅速平息西藏叛乱，表示衷心感谢和亲切的慰问。慰问信中说：“我们全体职工一致向党保证以搞好工作的实际行动，全力支援你们。”
    新疆维吾尔自治区人民医院口腔科、五官科的医护人员们，在慰问信中说：“你们出色地在短时间内平息了叛乱，我们欢庆这一胜利，并向你们致以崇高的敬礼！”
    这许许多多慰问信把祖国各地人民的关怀带给了平叛部队，给战士们的鼓舞很大。某连队的战士刘金河的双腿在过雪山时受了冻伤，痛得不便走路。连长要他留下来。可是，当刘金河休息的时候，成都市十一中学学生寄来的一封慰问信送到了他的手里。刘金河读着：“亲爱的叔叔：当我们听到叔叔们迅速平息了拉萨叛乱之后，又在山南地区取得巨大胜利的消息时，我们的心飞到了高原，飞到了喜马拉雅山上，飞到了叔叔们的身边……。你们的功绩将鼓舞着我们更加努力地学习……。”刘金河读完信后，一夜睡不着觉。他想，孩子们这样关怀自己，难道我连双腿冻伤这点困难都不能克服吗？于是，第二天他坚决随队出发，追击残匪，不但没有掉队，而且还帮助其他战士们背枪，背东西。后来，在一次战斗中，他抓了三个匪徒。
    平叛部队在千里行军追歼残匪的战斗中，有一些连队在夜以继日地趟冰河、过雪山、踏草原中，遇到了异常艰苦的情况。这时，战士们常常朗诵着亲人们寄来的慰问信。前些日子，战士们在行军作战中常常由于缺水而用雪拌炒面吃。他们却乐观地唱道：“高原吃炒面，白糖（指雪）放里边。藏胞得解放，战士好喜欢。”
