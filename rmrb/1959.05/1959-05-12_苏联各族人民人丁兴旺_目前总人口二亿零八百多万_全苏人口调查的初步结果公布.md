Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 11th: TASS reported from Moscow: The Central Statistical Bureau of the Council of Ministers of the USSR published an official communiqué on the preliminary results of the All-Union Population Census on the 9th. The communiqué pointed out that as of January 15, 1959, the Soviet Union's population totaled 208,826,000 people, an increase of 18.1 million people, or 9.5%, compared to the pre-war period (1939).

The Soviet Union has one of the lowest mortality rates in the world, at 7.5 per thousand. The birth rate in the Soviet Union is very high, exceeding 25 per thousand. The overall mortality rate has decreased by three-quarters compared to the pre-revolutionary period, and the infant mortality rate has decreased by approximately six-sevenths.

Recently, the natural population growth rate in the Soviet Union has exceeded 3.5 million annually. Since the 1939 population census, the population increase has been particularly significant in the Central Asian and South Caucasian republics, and Kazakhstan. For example, Kazakhstan's population increased by 52.6% during this period, Kyrgyzstan by 41.5%, Tajikistan by 33.6%, Uzbekistan by 28%, and Armenia by 37.9%. These figures clearly demonstrate that, thanks to the implementation of Lenin's national policy in the Soviet Union, the populations of previously oppressed ethnic groups have flourished.

Due to the vigorous development of industry, the establishment of new industrial centers, and the reclamation of wasteland in vast areas of Kazakhstan, Siberia, the Urals, and the Far East, the geographical distribution of the population has undergone tremendous changes. In the past two decades, the population of the Far East has increased by 70%, Eastern Siberia by 34%, Western Siberia by 24%, and the Urals by 32%.

According to census data, the Soviet Union has approximately 94 million men (45%) and approximately 114.8 million women (55%). This ratio is due to the situation of the elderly and the consequences of the war, mainly World War II. As for the male-to-female ratio under the age of thirty-two, it is currently equal.

The urban population of the Soviet Union totals 99.8 million. In the past two decades, the urban population has increased by 39.4 million. The percentage of the urban population has increased from 32 to 48. This increase is due to the natural growth of the urban population and the large number of rural residents who have moved to cities and industrial and mining areas for work.

The Soviet Union currently has 1,694 cities, an increase of 503 since 1939. The number of urban-type settlements has increased from 1,568 to 2,922. Currently, there are 299 cities with a population of over 50,000, including 123 cities with a population of 100,000 to 500,000, and 25 cities with a population of over 500,000. The population of many cities has doubled or more. Moscow's population has exceeded 5 million.

The All-Union Population Census was conducted in January 1959. 600,000 calculators and other personnel participated in this work.

Currently, various machine calculation stations are sorting out detailed population census materials according to gender, age, ethnicity, language, education level, family status, social class, sources of livelihood, national economic sectors, production sectors, and important occupations.

    苏联各族人民人丁兴旺
    目前总人口二亿零八百多万
    全苏人口调查的初步结果公布
    新华社11日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联部长会议中央统计局9日发表了关于全苏人口调查初步结果的正式公报。公报指出，到1959年1月15日为止，苏联人口共有二亿零八百八十二万六千人，比战前时期（1939年）增加了一千八百一十万人，即增加了9.5％。
    苏联人口死亡率是世界上最低的，为千分之七点五。苏联的出生率很高，达千分之二十五以上。人口总死亡率比革命前减少了四分之三，婴儿死亡率约减少了七分之六。
    最近，苏联人口自然增殖率每年超过了三百五十万。自从1939年人口调查以来，人口增加特别显著的是中亚细亚、南高加索各共和国和哈萨克。例如，哈萨克的人口在这个时期增加了52.6％，吉尔吉斯增加了41.5％，塔吉克增加了33.6％，乌兹别克增加了28％，亚美尼亚增加了37.9％。这些数字清楚地证明，由于在苏联实行了列宁的民族政策，过去受压迫的各族人民的人丁已经兴旺了起来。
    由于工业的蓬勃发展、新工业中心的建立和在哈萨克、西伯利亚、乌拉尔以及远东的广阔地区开垦荒地的结果，人口的地理分布情况起了巨大的变化。近二十年来，远东地区的人口增加了70％，东西伯利亚增加了34％，西西伯利亚增加了24％，乌拉尔增加了32％。
    根据调查资料，苏联男子约有九千四百万（占45％），女子约有一亿一千四百八十万（占55％）。这种比例是由于老年人的情况和战争，主要是第二次世界大战的后果所造成的。至于三十二岁以下的男女比例，目前是相等的。
    苏联城市人口共有九千九百八十万。近二十年来，城市人口共增加了三千九百四十万。城市人口的百分比由三十二增长到四十八。这种增长是由于城市人口的自然增殖和大量农村居民转入城市和工矿区工作所造成的。
    苏联目前共有一千六百九十四座城市，比1939年增加了五百零三座。城市型的居民区由一千五百六十八个增加到二千九百二十二个。目前，五万人口以上的城市共有二百九十九座，其中十万到五十万人口的城市有一百二十三座，五十万人口以上的城市有二十五座。许多城市的人口增加了一倍到两倍以上。莫斯科的人口已超过五百万。
    这次全苏人口调查是在1959年1月份进行的。有六十万计算人员和其他人员参加这项工作。
    目前，各机器计算站正在按照性别、年龄、民族、语言、文化程度、家庭状况、社会阶层、生活来源、国民经济部门、生产部门，以及重要职业等方面整理详细的人口调查材料。
