Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, May 23rd. Just as the summer harvest season is in full swing in southern China, Heilongjiang Province, the northernmost part of our country, is just beginning its annual rice sowing and transplanting.

This year, the rice-growing area in Heilongjiang Province has moved another two degrees northward, reaching Mohe area, located at 53 degrees north latitude, which is known as the "Arctic" of the motherland. At present, in several counties with more rice cultivation, such as Wuchang, Dongning, and Ning'an, male and female commune members are transplanting rice seedlings in the softened and neatly prepared paddy fields using newly made rice transplanters.

Heilongjiang plans to plant six million mu of rice this year, an increase of more than one million mu compared to the actual planting area last year. In order to strive for large-scale, high-yield rice production, people's communes in various localities have formulated increased production measures according to local conditions, and promoted effective transplanting methods on 50% of the rice area. They have also trained rice transplanting technicians and promoted the Lilingshi-style rice transplanter before transplanting.

Heilongjiang Province has a short frost-free period, with the southernmost areas having only 130 frost-free days. In the past, rice planting often suffered reduced yields due to early frost. To ensure that the rice matures before the arrival of early frost, the province has universally adopted the oil paper seedling cultivation method suitable for low-temperature areas (covering the seedlings with a layer of oil paper when the climate is cold in the morning and evening), which has advanced the transplanting period by about half a month compared to direct sowing in previous years.

Before transplanting and sowing, all localities have carefully processed the paddy fields. In addition to autumn plowing and fertilization last year, another spring plowing and a fine fertilization were carried out this spring. Various localities have also prepared chemical fertilizers for later topdressing. In terms of seeds, all localities have universally selected the higher-yielding "Aomori No. 2" and "Atomic No. 5" varieties, and have carried out seed soaking, disinfection, and water soaking for germination before sowing.

Due to the spring drought this year, the water volume of some rivers has decreased. Now, farmers in these areas are fighting against the drought. They have dug many small wells and artesian springs to increase water sources to ensure irrigation of the paddy fields. Water sources are managed uniformly, and special personnel are assigned to guard each canal and each section to ensure reasonable water supply and conserve water.

### 祖国的“北极”开始插秧  黑龙江水稻地区今年又北移二度

    祖国的“北极”开始插秧
    黑龙江水稻地区今年又北移二度
    新华社哈尔滨23日电　正值我国南方夏收大忙季节，我国最北部的黑龙江省才开始一年一度的水稻播种插秧。
    今年黑龙江省的播种水稻地区，又向北移动了两度，达到了被人们称为祖国的“北极”——位于北纬五十三度的漠河地区。目前，五常、东宁和宁安等几个种植水稻较多的县份，男女社员们正在耕得酥松、整齐的稻田里用新制的插秧机插秧。
    黑龙江今年计划种植水稻六百万亩，比去年实种面积增加一百多万亩。为争取水稻大面积高产，各地人民公社都因地制宜地制定了增产措施，在50％的水稻面积上，推广了增产有效的插秧方法。并在插秧前训练了插秧技术人员和推广了醴陵式插秧机。
    黑龙江省无霜期短，最南的地方无霜期也只有一百三十天，过去播种的水稻常因早霜而减产。为使水稻在早霜到来前成熟，今年，全省普遍采用了适合低温地区的油纸育秧方法（早晚气候冷的时候在秧苗上面铺一层油纸）使插秧期比往年直播时提前了半个月左右。
    各地在插秧、播种前对稻田作了细致的加工，除去年进行过秋翻、秋施肥外，今年春天又进行了一次春翻和施了一次细肥。各地还准备了后期追肥使用的化学肥料。在种籽方面，各地普遍选种了产量较高的“青森二号”和“原子五号”品种，播种前都进行了浸种、消毒和浸水催芽处理。
    由于今年春旱，有些河流的水量减少，现在，这些地区的农民正在和干旱作斗争，他们挖了许多小井和自流泉增加水源，保证稻田的灌溉。统一管理水源，在每一道渠沟，每一个地段都设专人看管，以保证合理灌水，节约用水。
