Sairdin, a member of the Dongfeng People's Commune in Huocheng County, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, has been praised by the local people for his hard work and three years of perfect attendance. The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Committee of the Communist Party of China recently issued instructions calling on farmers of all ethnic groups to launch a "Learn from Sairdin" campaign. The Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Committee of the Communist Youth League also commended Sairdin's exemplary deeds on the 11th, calling on young people of all ethnic groups on the agricultural and pastoral front to learn from Sairdin's noble qualities of loving the people's commune, loving labor, cherishing time, and working hard.

Sairdin is twenty-one years old this year and is the son of a poor Uygur peasant. Since joining the agricultural cooperative, he has worked hard every day for the past three years, regardless of the busy or slack seasons, or the scorching sun or severe cold. He has exceeded his quota every year and has been rated as a model commune member. Last year alone, he worked more than 430 workdays, and the commune members praised him as an "unstoppable person."

Sairdin's outstanding advantage is his love of labor, his willingness to work hard and bear grudges, and his ability to overcome all difficulties. In the Huocheng area, because the land is vast and the population is sparse, and the farmland is far from where people live, in order to save travel time, Sairdin has lived and eaten wherever he works for the past three years, regardless of spring, summer, autumn, or winter. Even when driving a large cart, he carries a hoe so that he can repair bridges and roads while driving. Secondly, Sairdin always puts hardship first and enjoyment last in his labor, emphasizing quality and efficiency. Every year during the Eid al-Fitr and Corban Festival holidays, when the commune members take a holiday, he voluntarily asks to feed the draught animals, keeping his hands busy. When it snows in the spring and plowing has to be suspended, he asks to stay in the mountains to look after the farm tools. On autumn harvest nights, he asks to guard the fields against wild boars. When building canals in the cold winter months, he even gives his rubber shoes to other commune members, taking the lead in jumping into the icy canals to work. These touching exemplary deeds have been warmly praised by the surrounding masses. (Xinhua News Agency)

    赛尔丁三年没有缺勤
    新疆维吾尔自治区霍城县东风人民公社社员赛尔丁辛勤劳动、三年不缺勤，获得了当地群众的一致赞扬。中共新疆维吾尔自治区委员会在最近发出指示，号召各族农民开展一个“学习赛尔丁”的运动。共青团新疆维吾尔自治区委员会，也在11日表扬了赛尔丁的模范事迹，并号召农牧业战线上各族青年学习赛尔丁热爱人民公社、热爱劳动、珍惜时间、辛勤工作的高尚品质。
    赛尔丁今年二十一岁，是一个维吾尔族贫农的儿子。他自从参加农业合作社后，三年来不管农忙农闲，也不管炎日酷寒，每天起早摸黑地劳动，年年超额完成定额，被评为模范社员。去年一年，他共做了四百三十多个劳动日，社员们都夸他为“闲不住的人”。
    赛尔丁突出的优点，是热爱劳动，并且任劳任怨，能克服一切困难。在霍城一带，因地广人稀，农田距离居住的地方远，为节省往返时间，赛尔丁三年来不论春夏秋冬，都是在哪里劳动，就在哪里食宿。就是赶大车，也要扛着砍土镘，一边赶车，一边修桥补路。其次，赛尔丁在劳动中总是吃苦在先，享乐在后，讲求质量和工效。每年开斋节和库尔班节假日，社员休假了，他就主动要求喂养耕畜，两手不闲，春寒下雪，犁地不得不暂停，他就要求留在山地看管农具，秋收的夜晚，他就要求守场防野猪，在寒冬腊月修筑渠道的时候，他还把胶鞋让给别的社员穿，自己则带头跳进冰冷的水渠进行劳动。这些动人的模范事迹，得到了周围群众的热烈赞颂。　（新华社）
