Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, May 7th: The Secretariat of the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Council on the 7th called on Afro-Asian countries to designate the upcoming June 1st as "Day of Solidarity with the People of South Arabia."

In a statement read by Youssef el-Sebai, Secretary-General of the Secretariat of the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Council, at a press conference held on the 7th, he called for the organization of protest demonstrations throughout Asia and Africa on June 1st, and the convening of mass rallies in conjunction with various parties and groups. The Council Secretariat suggested that resolutions be passed at these mass rallies condemning British actions in South Arabia and expressing solidarity with the Arab people's struggle for freedom.

In the statement, the Council Secretariat described in detail the situation of the British carrying out cruel suppression of the South Arabian people who are fighting for freedom. The statement said: "As people have recently witnessed in the Aulaqi region, tanks, heavy artillery, and airplanes have been used to suppress Arab tribes. These heroic tribes have not surrendered to the imperialists; they have gone to the mountains to continue their resistance, where they are attacked by airplanes."

The statement called on the Afro-Asian people to pay attention to the oppression and the conspiracies being plotted by British imperialism against the people of South Arabia. The statement said that British imperialists should be subjected to the strongest condemnation by all freedom-loving people. The people of South Arabia, in their struggle to resist British imperialism, should receive and need the moral and material support of the broad masses of Afro-Asian people.

    亚非人民团结理事会书记处发表声明
    号召举行“声援南阿拉伯人民日”
    据新华社开罗电　亚非人民团结理事会书记处7日号召亚非各国把即将到来的6月1日定为“声援南阿拉伯人民日”。
    亚非人民团结理事会书记处总书记尤素福·西巴伊在7日举行的记者招待会上宣读的一项声明中，号召于6月1日这天在亚非各地组织抗议示威，并且联合各党派和团体举行群众大会。理事会书记处建议在这些群众大会上通过决议，谴责英国在南阿拉伯的行动，并且表示声援阿拉伯人民争取自由的斗争。
    理事会书记处在这项声明中详细叙述了英国对争取自由的南阿拉伯人民进行残酷镇压的情况。声明说：“正如人们最近在奥拉基地区亲眼看到的那样，坦克、重型大炮和飞机被用来镇压阿拉伯部族。这些英勇的部族没有向帝国主义者投降，他们到山上去继续抵抗，他们在那里遭到飞机的袭击。”
    声明要求亚非人民注意英帝国主义者对南阿拉伯人民施加的压迫和正在策划的阴谋。声明说，英帝国主义者应当受到一切爱好自由的人民的最强烈的谴责。南阿拉伯人民在抵抗英帝国主义的斗争中，应当受到而且需要广大的亚非人民的道义上的和物质上的支持。
