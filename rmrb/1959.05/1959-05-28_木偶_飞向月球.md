    The Shanghai Red Star Puppet Troupe recently presented the children's science fiction drama "Flying to the Moon," using a combination of rod puppets, marionettes, and glove puppets for the first time.

    The Red Star Puppet Troupe, which previously only performed rod puppet shows, made considerable efforts in staging "Flying to the Moon." The performers manipulated a self-made device, making the three children obediently climb onto the rocket, and it was impossible to tell that they were being lifted by the puppeteers using marionette strings. They also made a shaking backdrop, so the rocket appeared to be actually flying in the blue starry sky. The petite and exquisite glove puppet dolls, performed by the actors wearing them on their hands, also appeared particularly nimble and lively.

    Before liberation, this troupe had only a few actors and more than a dozen old-fashioned costume puppets. The actors had no way to make a living and had to wander in the countryside, performing for people's weddings and funerals. Since liberation, the troupe has grown to fifteen actors and nearly two hundred puppets of various kinds. They also regularly go to some primary and secondary schools to tutor children in performing puppet shows.

### 木偶“飞向月球”

    木偶“飞向月球”
    上海红星木偶剧团最近第一次把木头、提线和布袋三种木偶综合运用，演出了儿童科学幻想剧“飞向月球”。
    过去一直只演杖头木偶的红星木偶剧团，在演出“飞向月球”的过程中作了不少努力。演员们操纵着一个自制的工具，使三个小朋友很听话地跨上火箭，看不出是演员用提线方法牵上去的。他们还做了一块可以摇动的转景，这样火箭就像真的在蓝色的星空里飞行。小巧玲珑的布袋木偶布娃娃，由演员套在手里表演，也显得特别灵巧活泼。
    这个剧团在解放前只有几个演员和十多个陈旧的古装木偶。演员们由于无法养家活命，只好流落在农村为人们的婚丧等事演演戏。解放以来，这个团已发展到十五个演员、近二百个各种各样的木偶了。他们还经常到一些中小学校里去辅导儿童演出木偶戏。
