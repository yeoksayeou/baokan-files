Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, May 4th -- According to a report in today's "Indian Express" from Mussoorie, the so-called "India Tibet Friendship Association" met in Mussoorie on the 3rd. At the meeting, a Mr. Mukherjee, described as a "renowned historian," openly clamored that Tibet and China are two different countries; China must grant Tibet independence.

Mukherjee nonsensically claimed that historically, China never continuously and exclusively possessed suzerainty over Tibet. Tibet had always paid tribute to Nepal, thus accepting Nepal's suzerainty over this Lamaist land.

Mukherjee even distorted the relationship between the Chinese Central People's Government and the Tibetan local government, comparing it to the past relationship between Britain and India—that of a colonial power and a colony. He said that since the British, who once possessed suzerainty and sovereignty over India and treated India as merely an appendage, could leave India, there was no reason to explain why progressive and dialectical Chinese should incessantly use Communist jargon such as imperialist interference and expansionist conspiracy when talking about their suzerainty.

Starting from such an absurd and illogical premise, Mukherjee continued, no country should use force or pressure to occupy another country. Tibet and China are two different countries. Therefore, China must grant Tibet independence, allowing the Tibetan people to strive for their own progress, without forcing people who originally believed in religion to live a communist or socialist life.

Mukherjee also portrayed the Tibet issue as a challenge to human conscience and hoped that China would listen to world opinion and stop waging a cold war against friendly India.

According to the "Statesman," this so-called "India Tibet Friendship Association" also "criticized China for using cold war language against India to cover up its crimes in Tibet."

Today's "Indian Express" also reported that the Delhi People's League's seventh annual meeting, held here on the evening of May 2nd, passed a resolution openly demanding that "the Dalai Lama be given all facilities and freedom to guide and direct the Tibetans' fight against Chinese imperialism."

The resolution also demanded that the Indian government immediately take measures to strengthen the defense of India's northern border, supposedly "because it is exposed to China's infiltration and unfriendly activities."

According to a report by the Near East Far East News Agency (headquartered in London and operating mainly in Bombay) published in the "Indian Express," all Indian political parties, except the Communist Party, are now preparing to convene an all-India conference in Calcutta on May 28 to discuss the Tibet issue. The conference will be chaired by Narain, leader of the Praja Socialist Party.

The report said: "It has also been suggested to convene a conference of all Asian countries to draw attention to the events in Tibet that led to the Dalai Lama's flight to India. The Calcutta conference may make a decision in this regard."

There are also reports that the United States has established a so-called "American Emergency Committee to Aid Tibetan Refugees." The committee's representative, Fletcher, is currently active in India, reportedly "seeking to estimate the nature and amount of aid the United States will provide to the Tibetans."

### 干涉中国内政的叫嚷仍未休止

　　干涉中国内政的叫嚷仍未休止
　　所谓“印度西藏友好协会”举行集会诬蔑攻击我国
　　德里人民同盟通过决议硬说印度面临我国渗入威胁
　　“印度快报”透露讨论西藏问题的全印大会正在准备
    新华社新德里4日电　据“印度快报”今天刊登的一条发自穆索里的消息说，所谓的“印度西藏友好协会”3日在穆索里开会，在会上有一位被称为“著名历史学家”的慕克吉公然叫嚣说，西藏和中国是两个不同的国家；中国必须给予西藏独立。
    慕克吉胡说什么在历史上，中国从来没有连续不断地、独有地拥有对西藏的宗主权。西藏过去一直向尼泊尔纳贡，从而接受了尼泊尔对于这个喇嘛国土的宗主权。
    慕克吉甚至还把中国中央人民政府同西藏地方政府之间的关系歪曲地比拟为过去英国同印度之间殖民国同殖民地的关系。他说，既然过去对于印度拥有宗主权和主权并且把印度当作不过是一个附属国的英国人都能离开印度，那末没有理由来解释为什么进步的和讲求辩证法的中国人竟要使用所谓帝国主义干涉和扩张主义者阴谋这种共产党的措词来絮絮不休地谈他们的宗主权。
    从这样一个荒谬的、不伦不类的前提出发，慕克吉接着说，任何一个国家都不应当使用武力或压力来占有别一个国家。西藏和中国是两个不同的国家。因此，中国必须给予西藏独立，让西藏人自己为自己的进步而努力，而不强迫本来信奉宗教的人民去过共产主义或者社会主义的生活。
    慕克吉还把西藏问题说成是对人类良心的挑战，并且希望中国倾听世界舆论和停止向友好的印度进行冷战。
    据“政治家报”说，这个所谓的“印度西藏友好协会”还“批评中国对印度使用冷战语言以掩饰它在西藏的罪行”。
    今天的“印度快报”还报道，德里人民同盟第七次年会5月2日晚上在这里举行的会议通过一项决议，公开要求“给予达赖喇嘛一切便利和自由来指导和指挥西藏人对中国帝国主义的战斗”。
    决议还要求印度政府立刻采取措施来加强印度北部边境的防务，据说是“因为那里暴露在中国的渗入活动和不友好活动的面前”。
    据“印度快报”登载的近东远东通讯社（总社设在伦敦而以孟买为活动中心）的一条消息说，印度的所有政党，除共产党以外，现在正在进行准备，要在5月28日在加尔各答召开一个讨论西藏问题的全印大会。这个大会将由人民社会党的首领纳拉扬主持。
    消息说：“还有人建议召开所有亚洲国家会议使人们注意促使达赖喇嘛逃到印度来的西藏事件。加尔各答会议可能在这方面作出决定。”
    还有消息说，美国已经成立了一个所谓“美国帮助西藏难民紧急委员会”。这个委员会的代表弗莱彻现在正在印度进行活动，据说他是在“设法估计美国将给予西藏人的援助的性质和数量”。
