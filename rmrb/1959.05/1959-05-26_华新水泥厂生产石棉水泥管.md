Huaxin Cement Plant Produces Asbestos Cement Pipes

    (Our Wuhan Dispatch) The newly built asbestos cement products workshop of the Huaxin Cement Plant has been producing large quantities of asbestos cement pipes since it was put into operation in March, supporting the development of oil fields and coal mining in Sichuan, Hubei and other places.
    This asbestos cement products workshop includes two sets of asbestos cement pipe making equipment and one set of asbestos cement board making equipment. It can produce more than 1,300 kilometers of asbestos cement pipes with diameters (inner diameter) ranging from 50 mm to 960 mm, and more than 6,000 tons of electrical insulation boards of various specifications annually. These asbestos cement pipes have the characteristics of anti-corrosion, anti-rust, heat insulation and high-pressure resistance. They are mainly used to replace seamless steel pipes and high-grade cast iron pipes as oil pipelines, various gas pipes, water pipes and steam pipes with temperatures not exceeding 300 degrees Celsius, saving 80,000 to 100,000 tons of steel per year.

    华新水泥厂生产石棉水泥管
    本报武汉讯  华新水泥厂新建的石棉水泥制品车间，从3月份投入生产以来，已生产出大批石棉水泥制管，支援了四川、湖北等地开发油田和采煤使用。
    这个石棉水泥制品车间，包括两套石棉水泥制管设备和一套石棉水泥制板设备，每年可以生产直径（内径）五十公厘到九百六十公厘的石棉水泥管一千三百多公里，各种规格的电器绝缘板六千多吨。这些石棉水泥制管，具有防腐、防锈、隔热和耐高压等特点，主要用来代替无缝钢管和高级铸铁管，作石油输油管、各种煤气管、水管和温度不超过摄氏三百度以上的蒸气管等，一年可节约八万至十万吨钢材。
