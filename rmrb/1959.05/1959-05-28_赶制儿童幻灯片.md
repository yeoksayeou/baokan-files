    Rushing to Produce Children's Slides
    To welcome "June 1st" International Children's Day, the Beijing Slide Film Studio has rushed to produce a large number of children's slides as holiday gifts for the children.
    The Beijing Slide Film Studio produces many types of children's slides. Regarding the target audience, there are slides for four- and five-year-olds, eight- and nine-year-olds, and those suitable for Young Pioneers. Regarding the content, there are realistic, classical, Chinese, and foreign slides, totaling about eighty types. The stories are very touching, and the pictures are vivid and have educational significance.
    Among these newly released slides, there are also small stories describing the childhood lives of leaders, such as "Stories of Chairman Mao's Childhood" and "Marshal Zhu De's Childhood Stories." The leaders' spirit of diligent study, love of labor, and selfless devotion to others are good examples for children to learn from.
    Organizing slide shows for children during the holiday can make their holiday more colorful. (Huang Xunrui)

    赶制儿童幻灯片
    为了迎接“六一”国际儿童节，北京幻灯制片厂已经赶制了大批儿童幻灯片，作为送给孩子们的节日礼物。
    北京幻灯制片厂出品的儿童幻灯片种类很多，拿幻灯片的对象来说，有给四、五岁孩子看的，有给八、九岁孩子看的，也有适合红领巾看的。拿幻灯片的内容来说，有现实的、有古典的，有中国的、有外国的，共约八十多种，故事都非常动人，画面更是生动，有一定的教育意义。
    在这些新出的幻灯片中，还有描述领袖们幼年时代的生活小故事，如“毛主席少年时代的故事”和“朱德元帅童年的小故事”。领袖们那种好学不倦、热爱劳动，舍己为人的大公无私的精神，都是孩子们学习的好榜样。
    在节日为孩子们展开幻灯活动，可以让孩子们把节日过得更丰富多彩。  （黄洵瑞）
