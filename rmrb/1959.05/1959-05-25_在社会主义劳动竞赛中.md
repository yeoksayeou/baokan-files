In the socialist labor competition, the vast number of workers on the Tianjin industrial front have been engaging in vigorous technical revolution and technical innovation, resulting in the emergence of many advanced individuals and advanced deeds, and improving the quality and output of products.

    **Galvanizing Before Drawing Steel Wire**

The young workers of Tianjin Steel Wire Rope Factory recently changed the process for steel wires below 0.5 mm from drawing thin before galvanizing to hot-dip galvanizing before drawing thin. This can save the manpower and material resources of a galvanizing workshop and improve the quality of the steel wire rope.

In the technical revolution and technical innovation movement, the factory's workers put their minds to work on quality issues. Kong Fanzhong, a member of the Communist Youth League and a bottom-line worker, proposed the suggestion of "galvanizing before drawing wire," which was immediately supported by the Party branch. The Party branch also organized all the young people in the workshop to help Kong Fanzhong realize this suggestion.

Galvanizing before drawing wire is a very complex technology. The strength of the steel wire after cold drawing is specified; however, can this strength still be maintained after hot-dip galvanizing and then drawing thin? Although everyone was unsure, they were motivated and worked together to conduct experiments. The experiment succeeded on the fifth attempt. The drawn steel wire was better in terms of finish than electro-galvanized wire, and its physical properties were also better than electro-galvanized wire. The twisted steel wire rope, after physical testing, also fully met the quality requirements. In this way, the electro-galvanizing workshop and the forty-four workers in this workshop can be saved, and a large amount of material costs can be saved.

    **Cleverly Made Blanking Machine**

Wang Hongtu, Zhuge Rongtang, and other veteran workers of Tianjin Flour Machinery Factory made a blanking machine, which increased the efficiency of cutting thick steel plates by one hundred and forty times, and the quality was good.

In the manufacture of rolling mill equipment, the factory had to cut more than 3,000 square meters of whole steel plates into various shapes of components to supply to various processes for processing. At the beginning, the workers used manual shears to cut, but because the steel plate was too thick, five people could only cut ten pieces of rolling mill hot saw parts a day, which was far from meeting the needs of the next process, and the labor intensity was very high. Seeing this situation, the veteran worker Wang Hongtu discussed with another veteran worker Zhuge Rongtang and proposed to use machines instead of manual operation. With the support of the Party branch, the two of them devoted all their energy to this major technical innovation. Li Boyuan, a planer, saw that they were studying hard, and also took the initiative to assist, suggesting that they use an electric motor to drive the shears. Wang Hongtu and Zhuge Rongtang made use of the factory's idle old pounding machine and modified it into a blanking machine, which not only increased efficiency by one hundred and forty times, but also made the cut pieces more neat, and saved the filing and straightening processes of manual cutting.

    **Shuttle Does Not Break**

Song Shaohua, Yang Lukai, Yan Guangyi and other veteran workers of Tianjin Xu'an Weaving Factory, aiming at the key to the broken shuttle, used the method of shuttle dropping to fundamentally solve the problem of shuttle breakage. The factory promoted this experience, and the quality and output have been greatly improved.

The factory has one hundred and fifty looms, producing seven kinds of products such as poplin. Because the shuttle often breaks, it affects both output and quality.

Master workers such as Song Shaohua studied a method of shuttle dropping. As long as the machine malfunctions, the shuttle will automatically drop before it is squeezed and broken in the weaving opening, and the car will stop. Take the shuttle up, tidy it up a bit, and you can drive and continue production. This fundamentally solves the problem of shuttle breakage. The whole factory is now actively preparing to promote it.

    在社会主义劳动竞赛中
    天津市工业战线上的广大职工，在社会主义劳动竞赛中，大闹技术革命和技术革新，涌现出不少先进人物和先进事迹，提高了产品质量和产量。
    先镀锌后拔钢丝
    天津钢丝绳厂青年职工，最近将0.5公厘以下的钢丝，由先拔细后镀锌改为先热镀锌后拔细，可以节省一个镀锌车间的人力物力，并且提高了钢丝绳的质量。
    在技术革命和技术革新运动中，这个厂的职工在质量问题上动了脑子。共青团员、下线工人孔凡忠提出了“先镀锌后拔丝”的建议，立即受到党支部的支持；党支部并把全车间的青年组织起来，帮助孔凡忠实现这一建议。
    先镀锌后拔丝是一项很复杂的技术。钢丝进行冷拔时，钢丝拔细后的强度是有规定的；可是，先热镀锌再拔细是不是还能保持这个强度呢？大家虽然心里没有底，但鼓起干劲，同心协力地进行了试验。试验到第五次，就得到成功。拔出来的钢丝，从光洁度看，比电镀锌好，物理性能也比电镀锌好。捻出的钢丝绳，经过物理试验，也完全合乎质量要求。这样，电镀车间和这个车间的四十四名工人都可以节省下来，并可以节约大笔材料费用。
    巧制冲裁机
    天津面粉机械厂的老工人王洪图、诸葛荣棠等制成一台冲裁机，使裁厚钢板效率提高一百四十倍，而且质量良好。
  这个厂在制造轧钢设备中，要把三千多平方公尺的整料钢板剪裁成各种形状的元件，供应各工序加工。开始时，工人们用人力压剪来剪裁，因为钢板太厚，五个人每天只能裁十块轧钢机热锯部件，远远不能供应下道工序的需要，而且劳动强度很大。老工人王洪图看到这种情况，和另一个老工人诸葛荣棠商量后，提出要用机器来代替手工操作。在党支部的支持下，他俩就用全付精力投入了这项重大的技术革新。刨工李伯元看见他们研究得很起劲，也主动来协助，建议他们用电动机来带动剪子。王洪图和诸葛荣棠两人把厂里闲置着的旧捣机利用起来，改装成冲裁机，不仅提高效率一百四十倍，而且剪下来的活更整齐，还省去了人工剪裁时的锉平、调直等工序。
    卡梭不断头
    天津旭安织布厂老工人宋绍华、杨禄凯、严广义等，针对卡梭断头的关键，用卡梭掉杼的办法，根本解决了卡梭断头的问题。厂里推广了这一经验，质量、产量有了很大提高。
    这个厂有一百五十台织布机，生产派力司等七种产品。因为卡梭经常断头，既影响产量，又影响质量。
    宋绍华等老师傅就研究了个卡梭掉杼的方法，只要机器一出毛病，梭子在织口内还没挤断的时候，杼就自动掉了下来，车就停住；将梭拿上来，稍加整理，就能开车连续生产。这就从根本上解决了卡梭断头的问题。现在全厂正积极准备推广。（附图片）
    国营天津第三棉纺织厂穿筘车间老工人赵岐山设计并利用废材料制造成功自动捻头机，可提高穿筘效率十倍到十四倍。这是赵岐山（左）和他的助手在检查自动捻头机。　本报记者　虞锡珪摄
