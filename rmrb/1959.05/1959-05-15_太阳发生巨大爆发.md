Xinhua News Agency, May 14th: TASS reports: On the 9th, an observatory near Vladivostok, Soviet Union, observed a massive flare on the surface of the sun. The flare process lasted nearly an hour. At its most intense, the flare was five times brighter than the surface of the sun.

　　At 1:53 AM Moscow time on the 9th, staff at the observatory began to detect a very bright spot in the northern hemisphere of the sun's surface. The brightness of the spot gradually increased until it was four times brighter than other parts of the sun's surface. Simultaneously, a solar prominence rose at an average speed of 450 kilometers per second, reaching a height of 300,000 kilometers above the sun's surface after sixteen minutes. Individual flares formed a pillar of fire, continuing to rise along a curved trajectory. By 2:46 AM Moscow time, the fire pillar had reached a height of approximately 600,000 kilometers. Then, the fire pillar transformed into many huge flaming droplets, falling back onto the sun's surface.

    太阳发生巨大爆发
    新华社14日讯　据塔斯社报道：苏联海参崴附近一个天文台在9日观测到太阳表面发生一次巨大爆发。爆发的过程将近一个小时，在爆发最猛烈的时候，爆发点的亮度为太阳表面亮度的五倍。
    在9日莫斯科时间一时五十三分，这个天文台的工作人员开始在太阳表面的北半部发现一个很亮的光点，光点的亮度逐渐增加，一直达到比太阳表面其他部分亮四倍的程度。同时，日珥以平均每秒四百五十公里的速度上升，十六分钟以后，上升到距太阳表面三十万公里的高空。个别焰流形成一根火柱，继续循弯曲的轨道上升。到莫斯科时间二时四十六分，火柱高度约达六十万公里。然后，这个火柱即化成许多巨大的焰滴，降落太阳表面。
