Xinhua News Agency News: Jiangxi Province has overcome the first few flood peaks this year in the five major rivers of Gan, Fu, Xiu, Xin, and Rao.

Since February of this year, the rainfall in various parts of Jiangxi Province has exceeded the rainfall in the same period of previous years by more than 100 millimeters. In the upper reaches of the Rao River and the lower reaches of the Xinzhong River, rainfall exceeded 100 millimeters in twelve hours on April 10. The water levels of the Gan River, the middle and lower reaches of the Fu River, and Poyang Lake have all exceeded the water levels of the same period in previous years. Because all the flood prevention preparations were made in a timely manner in the areas along the river and lake before entering the flood season: many dangerous sections of the dikes were inspected, more than 900 dike projects were reinforced, and a large number of bamboo and wood flood control materials were prepared, all areas safely weathered the arrival of the flood peaks.

At present, all parts of Jiangxi Province have concentrated even greater efforts to further improve flood prevention organizations and have thoroughly inspected the water conservancy projects completed last winter and this spring, which can store 8 billion cubic meters of water, in order to overcome the greater floods that may come in May.

    江西安全度过头几次洪峰
    新华社讯　江西省已经战胜赣、抚、修、信、饶等五大江河的今年头几次洪峰。
    今年2月份以来，江西省各地降雨量都超过历年同期的雨量一百多公厘。饶河上游和信中河下游一带，4月10日十二个小时内即降雨一百公厘以上。赣江、抚河中下游及鄱阳湖水位都超过了历年的同期水位。由于进入汛期以前，沿江滨湖地区都及时做好了各项防汛准备工作：检查了许多险要堤段，加固了九百多处堤防工程，准备了大批的竹木防汛器材，当洪峰到来时，各地都安全度过。
    目前，江西省各地已集中了更大的力量，进一步健全防汛组织，对去冬今春完成的能蓄水八十亿公方的水利工程，进行了彻底检查，以便战胜5月份可能来到的更大的洪水。
