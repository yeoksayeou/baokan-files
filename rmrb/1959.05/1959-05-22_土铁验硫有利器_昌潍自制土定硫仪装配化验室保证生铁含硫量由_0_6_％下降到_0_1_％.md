    A Useful Tool for Soil Iron Sulfur Testing
    Changwei's Self-Made Soil Sulfur Determinator Installed in Laboratories Guarantees Reduction of Sulfur Content in Pig Iron from 0.6% to 0.1%

    (Our Dispatch) The Changwei Special District of Shandong Province has equipped a steel testing team using its own manufactured soil sulfur determinator, which has significantly improved the quality of pig iron.
    In February of this year, the sulfur content of iron produced in this special district was generally around 0.6%. Due to the establishment of a testing team and the creation of the soil sulfur determinator, regular testing was conducted. Based on the test results, desulfurization measures were taken. Now, the sulfur content of pig iron throughout the special district has generally been reduced to around 0.1%.
    There are now more than thirty laboratories and two hundred testing personnel in the entire special district. These testing personnel are distributed in various counties and larger steel plants and mines. In order to ensure the normal production of blast furnaces and improve the quality of iron, they regularly and carefully identify the grade and sulfur content of ore. Before coke, ore, limestone, and other materials are put into the furnace, they are universally tested to calculate the data for material supply and proportioning for reference by production technicians, thereby ensuring the normal production of blast furnaces.
    The testing organization in this special district was started from scratch during the vigorous campaign for high-yield and high-quality steel this year. In the beginning, some people did not fully recognize the importance of testing, believing that "production is the same with or without testing" and that "testing cannot be done without a complete set of equipment and specialized personnel." In response to this ideological situation, various units mobilized the masses to launch a debate. Some units also used the example of the Weifang Fourth Steel Plant, which implemented testing at every stage and desulfurization to prevent blast furnace bottoming accidents, to educate cadres and the masses. Subsequently, the special district, on the one hand, ran training classes to train technicians; on the other hand, it sent people to Qingdao, Jinan, and other places to "learn from experience." After the people who learned from experience returned, they used methods such as "old leading new, familiar leading unfamiliar" to expand the testing team. Testing reagents and equipment were also mostly manufactured by the testing personnel themselves, breaking down superstitions. A simple and very accurate soil sulfur determinator created by the testing personnel of the Weifang Second Steel Plant can produce a test result in eight to ten minutes. Now, almost every laboratory in the entire special district is equipped with this type of soil sulfur determinator. Testing personnel also successfully experimented with using industrial-grade crude hydrochloric acid to make pure hydrochloric acid for testing analysis. Currently, the entire special district has self-manufactured forty to fifty types of soil testing instruments and reagents. In addition, hospitals, schools, and other factories in the special district also promoted the spirit of great collaboration, taking out temporarily unused instruments and reagents to help various steel plants solve the difficulties of lacking testing equipment.

    土铁验硫有利器
    昌潍自制土定硫仪装配化验室保证生铁含硫量由0.6％下降到0.1％
    本报讯　山东昌潍专区用自己制造的土定硫仪，装配了一支钢铁化验队伍，对于提高生铁质量起了显著作用。
    这个专区今年2月份所产生铁的含硫量一般在0.6％左右，由于建立了化验队伍和创造了土定硫仪，经常进行化验，根据化验结果采取了脱硫的措施，现在全专区生铁的含硫量已普遍降到0.1％左右。
    全专区现在有三十多个化验室，二百多名化验人员。这些化验人员分布在各县及较大的钢铁厂和矿山。他们为了保证高炉正常生产，提高铁的质量，对于矿石的品位和含硫量，都经常进行仔细鉴定；焦炭、矿石、石灰石等入炉以前，再普遍地进行化验，算出供料配料数据，供生产技术人员参考，从而保证了高炉的正常生产。
    这个专区的化验机构，是在今年大闹钢铁高产优质运动中白手起家的。开始，有些人对化验工作的重要性认识不足，认为：“化验不化验也一样生产”，“没有整套设备和专门人材不能搞化验。”针对这种思想情况，各单位发动群众展开了鸣放辩论。有的单位还用潍坊第四钢铁厂实行关关化验、脱硫而杜绝了高炉发生结底事故的事例，教育了干部和群众。随后，专区一方面开办训练班，培养技术人员；一方面又派人到青岛、济南等地“取经”，取经的人员回来以后，又用“以老带新、以熟带生”等办法，扩大了化验队伍。化验药品和设备，也大都是化验人员破除迷信自己动手制造的。潍坊第二钢铁厂化验人员创造的一种简易而且误差很小的土定硫仪，八分到十分钟就能做出一个化验结果。现在全专区每个化验室差不多都装置了这种土定硫仪。化验人员还用工业用的粗盐酸，试验成功了作化验分析用的纯盐酸。现在全专区已经自造出的土化验仪器和药品，共有四、五十种。此外，专区的医院、学校和其它工厂，也发扬了大协作的精神，把临时不用的仪器、药品拿出来，帮助各钢铁厂解决缺少化验设备的困难。（附图片）
