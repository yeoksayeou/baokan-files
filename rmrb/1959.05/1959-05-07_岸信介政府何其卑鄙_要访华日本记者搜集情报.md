Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 6th: The Japanese Communist Party's newspaper, "Akahata," reported yesterday that officials of the Kishi Nobusuke government had requested Japanese reporters who accompanied the Japan Socialist Party delegation to visit China in March of this year to collect and provide military intelligence about China.

This was announced by Masao Mukai, a member of the All-Japan Federation of Press Workers Unions, at a meeting of the Japan Federation of Press Workers Unions' Kyodo News branch executive committee on April 27. He said at the meeting that two people from the Prime Minister's Office Cabinet Research Office had talked to him before he left for China. These two people wanted him to engage in intelligence gathering activities during his visit to China and gave him a list of intelligence items that the Japanese government wanted to know, including more than a dozen items, mainly regarding China's economy, transportation, atomic energy development, ballistic missiles, and jet bombers. Mukai said that he refused this request. Mukai said that on his way back to Japan from China, officials from the Japanese consulate in Hong Kong also contacted him to ask him to provide information about China.

After Mukai returned to Japan, officials from the Kishi Nobusuke government also asked him to go to the Cabinet Research Office to provide information about the locations of radio stations and airports in Beijing.

The All-Japan Federation of Press Workers Unions, the Japan Federation of Press Unions, and the Japan-China Friendship Association have decided to strongly protest against this anti-China action by the Kishi Nobusuke government. Kyodo News reporters have already protested to the Cabinet Research Office regarding this despicable action by the Kishi Nobusuke government.

    岸信介政府何其卑鄙
    要访华日本记者搜集情报
    新华社6日讯　东京消息：日本共产党机关报“赤旗报”昨天报道，岸信介政府的官员曾经要求今年3月随同日本社会党代表团访问中国的日本记者收集和提供有关中国的军事情报。
    这是全日本新闻工作者协会会员向井正雄4月27日在全日本新闻工作者协会共同社分会专务理事会上宣布的。他在会上说，总理府内阁调查室有两个人曾经在他动身前往中国以前找他谈过话。这两个人要他在访问中国期间进行收集情报的活动，并且交给他一张日本政府希望知道的情报的项目单，其中包括十几个项目，主要是有关中国的经济、运输、原子能发展、弹道导弹和喷气轰炸机的情报。向井说，他拒绝了这个要求。向井说，在他从中国回日本途中，日本驻香港的领事馆官员还同他进行接触，要他提供关于中国的情报。
    在向井回国后，岸信介政府的官员还要他到内阁调查室去提供关于北京的广播站和飞机场的所在地的情报。
    全日本新闻工作者协会、日本新闻工会联合会和日中友好协会决定强烈抗议岸信介政府这种敌视中国的行动。共同社记者已经就岸信介政府的这种卑鄙行动向内阁调查室提出了抗议。
