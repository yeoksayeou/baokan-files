    Noon, the commune members put down their work and went home for lunch. Only Jin Guihua, because Team Leader Wang had criticized Zhang Shumei, felt upset and didn't bother to go home, heading straight for Old Zhang's house.
    As soon as she entered, she saw Shumei lying on the kang with her face inward. Grandpa Zhang was on the ground gesturing and lecturing her. Seeing Guihua, Grandpa Zhang smiled, then frowned again and said, "Look how silly this girl is!" He turned to Shumei, "Jade must be carved to become a useful object. Team Leader Wang said a few words to you for your own good, why are you crying?" Shumei suddenly sat up, her eyes red, her small mouth pouting high, and angrily said, "What do you mean 'for my own good'? I think Team Leader Wang is just too strict." "What are you saying? Little girl, don't speak ill of good people. When we moved here from our old home in Shandong, how warmly they treated us. As soon as we entered the gate, they invited us to their house for food and tea, and personally cleaned the house for our whole family to live in, have you forgotten?" Grandpa Zhang finished speaking, gave Guihua a wink and left. Guihua smiled understandingly, sat down beside Shumei, and said, "Shumei, hurry up and eat. If you can't transplant the rice well, don't worry. This afternoon, we sisters will take on a few paddies and guarantee you'll learn." Hearing Guihua say this, Shumei wiped away her tears and nudged Guihua's arm with her head, feeling a little embarrassed, and said "Um."
    The sun set in the west, Team Leader Wang stood on the edge of the rice paddy after transplanting, sweating profusely, his eyes fixed on the paddies Shumei was responsible for. The undisguised smile made his big mouth even wider. He said to Shumei's back, "Shumei, we have to hold an on-site meeting tomorrow, and put up big-character posters to praise you. I didn't expect your technique to improve so quickly in just one afternoon." Shumei was looking for her shoes on the edge of the paddy at this time. Hearing this, she hurriedly glanced at Guihua and said, "Team Leader Wang, you don't know at all..." Before she could finish, Team Leader Wang interrupted, "Oh! I understand, you found such a Guihua teacher, of course your technique will improve quickly." Hearing this, the two young girls laughed and sang, running happily. They were about to step onto the road quickly, when suddenly Shumei heard Guihua say "Ouch." Shumei stopped quickly and asked, "What's wrong?" It turned out that Guihua wasn't wearing shoes and had kicked a stone, hurting her foot. Shumei rubbed Guihua's foot while complaining about why she didn't wear shoes. Guihua said, "We Koreans don't know how to make shoes as well as you Han people. I rushed to weave a pair of straw sandals, but they broke before I finished transplanting the rice." Shumei rolled her eyes, nodded, and stood up and left. Arriving at the small bridge in the east of the village, they routinely sat on the big rock to wash their feet. Shumei suddenly said to Guihua, "Don't think I'm shorter than you, my feet are much bigger." Shumei said, stretching out her feet, "If you don't believe me, let's compare."
    In the evening, Guihua attended the rice transplanting technology research meeting, and didn't return home until late. Passing by Shumei's house, she saw the light was still on inside, and Shumei's shadow was projected on the window. She was busy with needlework. Guihua thought, "Shumei is really ambitious, still doing needlework so late!"
    Three days passed. One evening, Shumei ran to Guihua's house with a small package. As soon as she arrived, she stuffed the small package into Guihua's hands. Guihua opened the small package in confusion and saw that it was a pair of beautiful new shoes. Shumei said, "These are the shoes I made for you, try them on to see if they fit!" Guihua finally understood, covering her heart with both hands and said, "No wonder you've been busy until midnight these past few days, it turns out you were making shoes for me! You wanted to compare our feet that day for this reason, you little girl, you have so many ideas!" She put on the new shoes and tried them on, happily saying, "They fit me so well! But it must have tired you out." Shumei said, "It's nothing, it only took three nights to make them." Guihua looked at Shumei affectionately with her big black eyes and said, "You are so good to me." Shumei hugged Guihua's neck and said coquettishly, "No, no, you are my good sister. Without your help, how could I improve my rice transplanting technique?" Guihua's mother, who had been sitting silently on the edge of the kang, suddenly interjected, "Hey! You two girls, stop chattering. You were both born in a happy era, girls of two ethnic groups, becoming close sisters who care for each other." The two girls turned their heads to look at their mother, only to see a happy smile on her face as she looked at them.

    两个姑娘
    盖文富
    晌午，社员们放下活计，都回家吃饭去了。只有金桂花，因为王队长把张树梅批评了一通，她的心里也挺难受，没顾得回家去，就直奔老张家去了。
    一进屋，看见树梅头朝里躺在炕上，张大爷正在地下比比划划地说她。一见桂花，张大爷笑了笑，跟着又板下脸说：“你看这丫头多蠢！”他转过去向着树梅，“玉不琢不成器，王队长说你几句是为了你好，你哭啥？”。树梅猛的坐起来，眼睛通红，小嘴一噘多高，气呼呼地说：“啥叫为我好。我看王队长实在太厉害了。”“你说什么？小女孩子，说话不要屈赖好人。咱们打山东老家迁移到这里来的时候，人家待咱们多亲热，一进大门就让到他家去吃饭喝茶，又亲手把房子弄得干干净净叫咱们全家去住，你都忘了？”张大爷说完给桂花递个眼色就走了。桂花会意地微笑一下，坐到树梅的身边说：“树梅，快吃饭吧，插不好秧不怕，下半晌咱姐妹俩包几个池子插，准让你学会。”树梅听桂花这么一说，才揩了揩眼泪，怪不好意思地用头顶了顶桂花的胳膊，“嗯”了一声。
    太阳落下西山，王队长满头大汗地站在插完秧的稻池埂上，两眼出神地紧盯着树梅包插的那几个池子。隐藏不住的笑意使得他那大嘴咧得更大了。他冲着树梅的脊背说：“树梅，明天得召开现场会，贴大字报表扬你了，没想一个晌午工夫你的技术就提高这么快。”树梅这时正在池埂上找鞋，一听这话，急得瞅了瞅桂花说，“王队长，你一点也不知道……”还没等她说完，王队长就接过去说：“噢！我明白了，你找了这么一个桂花师傅，当然在技术上提高的快了。”两个年轻姑娘一听，都笑着，唱着，欢欢乐乐地跑了。几个快步快要踏上大路了，忽然树梅听见桂花“嗳哟”一声。树梅忙站住问：“怎么了？”原来桂花没有穿鞋，踢在石头上把脚踢疼了。树梅一边替桂花揉脚，一边埋怨她为什么不穿鞋。桂花说：“我们朝鲜族人不像你们汉族人那么会做鞋。我抢时间编了一双草鞋，没等插完秧就穿坏了。”树梅翻了翻眼睛，又点点头，就站起来走了。来到村东小桥边，她俩照例要坐在大石头上洗洗脚。树梅忽然对桂花说：“别看我比你个子矮，脚可比你大的多。”树梅说着就伸出脚来，“不信，咱俩比比看。”
    晚上桂花参加插秧技术研究会，直到三星打横时才回家。走过树梅家门口时，她看见屋里还点着灯，窗上映出了树梅的影子，她正两手不停地忙活计。桂花想“树梅真要强，这么晚还做针线活哪！”
    三天过去了。一天晚上，树梅挟着个小包，一溜烟跑到了桂花家。一到，她就把手拿的小包塞给了桂花。桂花莫名其妙地打开小包一看，原来是一双漂亮的新鞋。树梅说：“这是我给你做的鞋，快试试合不合脚！”桂花这才明白过来，双手捂着心口说：“怪不得你这几天一忙半夜，原来是给我做鞋呀！你那天要和我比脚大脚小，就是为了这个啊，你这个小丫头，主意真多！”她穿上新鞋试了又试，喜孜孜地说：“我穿多合适呀！可就是累坏了你。”树梅说：“这没啥，只用三个晚上就做成了。桂花用她那大黑眼睛深情地看着树梅说：“你待我太好了。”树梅搂着桂花的脖子撒娇地说：“不，不，你是我的好姐姐。若没有你的帮助，我哪能提高插秧技术呢？”呆坐在炕里边一直没说话的桂花的妈妈，这时忽然插嘴说：“咳！两个姑娘别唠叨了。你俩都生在幸福的时代，两个民族的女孩子，结成知疼知热的亲姐妹。”两个姑娘一齐回过头去瞅瞅妈妈，只见妈妈的脸上挂着幸福的微笑在瞧着她们。
