    The Tricks of Light
　　Si Nan
    Why is the sky blue and the clouds white? Why can't colors be accurately distinguished under electric light? Why do elderly people and young people judge colors differently?
    To find the answers to these questions, we must first start with light.
    In 1672, Newton conducted an interesting experiment: he allowed a beam of sunlight to pass through a small round hole into a dark room, and then through a glass prism. As a result, a colored band appeared on the screen behind the prism. This colored band was composed of seven overlapping colors: red, orange, yellow, green, cyan, blue, and violet. This phenomenon illustrates that white light is composed of various colors of light, that is, composed of various wavelengths of light. Red light has the longest wavelength, followed by successively decreasing wavelengths, with violet light having the shortest wavelength. Because the refractive index of different wavelengths of light varies, they are dispersed into a colored band after being refracted by the prism.
    Our vision of objects and colors comes from the reflection of light. Light first shines on an object and then is reflected into our eyes. Red objects can reflect red and some orange light, while absorbing other parts of white light. Blue objects, in addition to reflecting blue light and some violet and green light, almost completely absorb other colors. Light passing through transparent objects is similar; red glass can transmit the red and orange parts of light while absorbing other colors.
    A painting drawn at night under electric light, or a piece of floral fabric bought, will look different when viewed in daylight. This is because electric light is different from natural sunlight. Electric light contains a large amount of red and yellow light, while green and blue light are relatively scarce. Under electric light, red, orange, and yellow things appear particularly bright and dazzling, while blue and green things appear dull.
    As people age, due to physiological phenomena, the lens of the eye gradually turns yellow, like a light yellow piece of glass. Red and yellow light can pass through it smoothly, while most blue and violet light will be absorbed. Therefore, elderly people see things as if they are coated with a light yellow color, and feel that blue and violet are very dim.
    The blue sky with white clouds floating in it is also due to the effect of light. Gas molecules in the air can only scatter shorter wavelengths of blue light, so the sky appears blue; while clouds are larger water droplets that can scatter all colors of light, that is, scatter each part of white light to the same extent, so clouds are white.

    光的把戏
　　斯南
    为什么天空是蓝色的，云彩是白色的？为什么在电灯光下不能正确的辨别颜色？为什么老年人和年青人判断的颜色会不一样？
    要找出这些问题的答案，得先从光说起。
    1672年牛顿做了一个有趣的实验：他使一束太阳光通过一个小圆孔射进暗室，再透过一个玻璃的三棱镜，结果在三棱镜后面的幕上便映出了一条彩色的光带。这条光带是由红、橙、黄、绿、青、蓝、紫七种互相交叠的颜色排列而成。这个现象说明了白色的光是由各种不同颜色的光组合而成，也就是由各种不同波长的光组合而成。红色光的波长最长，随后依次递减，紫色光的波长最短。由于各种不同波长的光的折射率各不相同，所以经过三棱镜折射后便分散成彩色的光带。
    我们对物体和颜色的视觉是由光反射而来的，光线先照射到物体上再反射入我们的眼睛。红色的物体能将光线中的红色和部分橙色反射出来，而吸收了白色光中的其他部分。蓝色的物体除了反射出蓝色光及一部分紫色、绿色光外，几乎将其他各色完全吸收。光线通过透明的物体也是如此，红色的玻璃能透过光的红色、橙色部分而将其他色彩吸收掉。
    夜间在电灯光下画的画，买的花布，到了白天再看起来，颜色就会有了差别。这是由于电灯光和天然的太阳光不一样，电灯光中含有大量红色、黄色的光，而绿色、蓝色的光却比较少。在电灯光下，红色、橙色和黄色的东西就显得特别光彩夺目，而蓝色、绿色的东西却暗然无光。
    人到了老年，由于生理现象，眼睛的水晶体会逐渐泛黄，像一块淡黄色的玻璃。红色、黄色的光能顺利地透到里面，而大部分蓝色、紫色的光便会被吸收掉。因此老年人看东西便像涂上了一层淡黄色的色彩，觉得蓝色、紫色非常暗淡。
    蓝色的天空中飘浮着白色的云彩，这也是由于光的作用。空气中的气体分子微粒只能散射波长比较短的蓝色光，于是天空便呈现蓝色；而云却是颗粒较大的水滴，它能散射各色的光，也就是把白色光的各个部分同样程度的散射开来，所以云彩是白色的。
