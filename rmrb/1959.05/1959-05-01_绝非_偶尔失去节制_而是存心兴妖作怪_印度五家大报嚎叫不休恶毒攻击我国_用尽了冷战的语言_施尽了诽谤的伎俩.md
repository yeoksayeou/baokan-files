Xinhua News Agency, 30th dispatch from New Delhi: Since the Tibetan rebellion, five major English newspapers in India have published a large number of fact-twisting news items, provocative and defamatory comments, editorials, and vile cartoons, using countless Cold War languages, stirring up trouble, undermining Sino-Indian friendship, and interfering in China's internal affairs.

The five newspapers are the "Times of India," "Indian Express," "Hindustan Times," "Hindustan Standard," and "The Statesman." They are connected with Indian monopoly capital, and "The Statesman" is run by the British in India.

In the thirty-nine days from March 21 to April 28, "The Statesman" published 220 news items about the Tibetan rebellion, while "Hindustan Standard" published more than 200, of which 110 were published on the front page. The "Times of India" published 150 items on the front page alone.

"Hindustan Standard" published 17 news items about the Tibetan rebellion on April 14 alone, and "The Statesman" published 16 on April 20. On April 19, the "Times of India" used the entire front page to publish news about the Tibetan rebellion.

When these five newspapers reported the so-called "Dalai Lama's statement" on April 19, they all used full-page, bold headlines. The "Hindustan Times" also used a five-line, three-column headline under the eight-column headline to publicize it greatly. The "Hindustan Standard's" bold headline was "Dalai Lama Puts Beijing in the Defendant's Seat; Interference in Tibetan Affairs." The "Indian Express's" eight-column headline said, "Beijing Seizes Tibet's Autonomy; Dalai Lama's Accusations in First Public Statement."

Other headlines used by these newspapers included: "Prompting India to Intervene in Tibet; Delegation of One Hundred (Tibetan rebels - editor's note) Will Meet Nehru"; "Blatant Violation of the Panchsheel Spirit"; "Prime Minister Vociferously Opposes China's Slanderous Propaganda Campaign; Using Cold War Language"; "Beijing May Demand Indian Consulate to Cease Operations"; "From Guerrilla Warfare to National Uprising"; "Chinese Attack Temples; Room-to-Room Fighting"; "Heroic Stories of the First Khampa Town to Offend China," and so on.

In the half-year since last November, these newspapers rarely used full-page headlines on the front page. Only in a few cases, such as when the Indian government presented its budget and increased indirect taxes, did these capitalist newspapers use one or two full-page headlines on the first page. When reporting the Soviet Union's successful launch of a space rocket in January this year, a full-page headline was used once. But this time, regarding the reports of the Tibetan rebellion and the Dalai Lama being abducted to India, the "Hindustan Times," "Indian Express," and "The Statesman" used full-page headlines three times, and the "Times of India" used full-page headlines four times. The four full-page headlines used by the "Hindustan Standard" regarding the Tibetan events included: "Dalai Lama Puts Beijing in the Defendant's Seat"; "Dalai Lama's Incredible Journey to Freedom"; "Chinese Troops Sweep Tibetans."

In this month or so, these newspapers relegated other news of national and international importance to a secondary position. For example, on April 2, the "Hindustan Times" published Nehru's speech on April 1 at a rally in Bikaner, in which he asked the people to "must overcome poverty," on the last page, occupying only one column, while on the front page, the news about the debate in the People's Assembly used a five-column headline, saying that the Indian "Communist Party was accused of disloyalty." Even the news that the United States supplied jet bombers to Pakistan was only given a one-column, one-line headline and an inch of space, published near the bottom of the fifth column on the front page. Regarding the news of Britain instigating a rebellion in the Maldives, this newspaper published it on an unimportant inside page. The report on "record grain production this year" was extremely important news for this food-deficient country, but this newspaper only used a small amount of space to publish it on the last page.

These newspapers also wrote many slanderous editorials and commentaries with sensational titles. From March 21 to April 28, the "Hindustan Times" wrote six editorials and nine commentaries on the Tibetan rebellion. "Hindustan Standard" wrote nine editorials and four commentaries. "Indian Express" published a total of twenty-two editorials and commentaries. These newspapers also published some articles openly expressing support for the "Tibetan struggle for freedom."

These editorials used the same vicious words that the imperialists used to curse China: "Beijing's clumsy tricks of insisting on shameless lies"; "The Panchen Lama is their pawn"; "China's shadow is cast in places all around us"; "Communist Imperialism"; "A realistic reassessment of the basis of our foreign policy."

Recently, some editorials have begun to absurdly suggest convening a "three-way conference" of India, China, and Tibet to solve the so-called "Tibetan issue" planned by imperialists and foreign reactionaries. After their tricks were exposed, they became enraged and bit back at China, saying this was "China's war posture, China's slanderous attack."

### 绝非“偶尔失去节制”　而是存心兴妖作怪  印度五家大报嚎叫不休恶毒攻击我国  用尽了冷战的语言　施尽了诽谤的伎俩

    绝非“偶尔失去节制”　而是存心兴妖作怪
    印度五家大报嚎叫不休恶毒攻击我国
    用尽了冷战的语言　施尽了诽谤的伎俩
    新华社30日讯　新德里消息：在西藏叛乱事件发生以来，印度五家英文大报曾经刊载了大量歪曲事实的消息、挑拨性和诽谤性的评论、社论和恶劣的漫画，使用了无数冷战的语言，大肆兴风作浪，破坏中印友谊，干涉中国内政。
    这五家报纸是“印度时报”、
    “印度快报”、“印度斯坦时报”、
    “印度斯坦旗报”、“政治家报”，它们同印度的垄断资本有联系，其中“政治家报”是在印度的英国人办的。
    从3月21日至4月28日的三十九天内，“政治家报”刊登了二百二十条关于西藏叛乱事件的消息，而“印度斯坦旗报”刊登了二百条以上，其中一百一十条刊载在头版上。“印度时报”仅在头版就刊登了一百五十条。
    “印度斯坦旗报”在4月14日一天就刊载了十七条关于西藏叛乱事件的消息，“政治家报”在4月20日刊载了十六条。在4月19日，
  “印度时报”用整个头版刊登了关于西藏叛乱事件的消息。
    这五家报纸4月19日报道所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”时，都用了横贯全页的通栏黑体标题。“印度斯坦时报”在八栏标题下面还用了五行宽占三栏的标题来大事渲染。“印度斯坦旗报”的黑体大字标题是“达赖喇嘛使北京居于被告地位；干涉西藏事务”。“印度快报”的八栏大标题说，“北京夺去西藏的自治；达赖喇嘛在第一次公开声明中的指责”。
    这些报纸使用的其它标题有：“促使印度对西藏进行干预；一百人（西藏叛匪——编者按）组成的代表团将会见尼赫鲁”；“潘查希拉精神的明显破坏”；“总理大声疾呼反对中国的诽谤宣传运动；使用冷战语言”；“北京可能要求印度领事馆停止工作”；“从游击战到全国性的起义”；“中国人袭击寺院；从房间到房间的战斗”；“第一个冒犯中国的康巴族市镇的英雄故事”等等。
    自从去年11月以来的半年间，这些报纸很少在头版使用通栏标题。只有在印度政府提出预算和增加间接税等少数情况下，这些资本家的报纸才在第一版使用一两条通栏大标题。在今年1月报道苏联发射宇宙火箭成功时，用了一次通栏标题。但是这一次关于西藏叛乱事件和达赖喇嘛被劫持到印度去的报道，“印度斯坦时报”、“印度快报”和“政治家报”就三次使用了通栏标题，“印度时报”四次用了通栏标题。“印度斯坦旗报”四次使用的关于西藏事件的通栏标题包括：“达赖喇嘛使北京站在被告席上”；“达赖喇嘛走向自由的不可思议的旅行”；“中国军队扫荡西藏人”。
    在这一个多月中，这些报纸把其他具有全国和国际重要性的消息登在次要地位。例如，“印度斯坦时报”在4月2日把尼赫鲁4月1日在比加尼尔一次集会上要求人民“必须战胜贫穷”的演说，刊载在最后一版，只占一栏地位，而在头版上，关于人民院的辩论的消息却用了五栏大标题说，印度“共产党被指责为不忠诚”。甚至像美国把喷气式轰炸机供给巴基斯坦这条消息，也只用了一栏一行的标题和一英寸的地位，登在头版第五栏底部附近。关于英国制造马尔代夫群岛叛乱的消息，这家报纸把它登在不重要的里页。关于“今年粮食生产打破纪录”的报道对这个缺粮的国家说来是极其重要的消息，但是这家报纸只用了很小的篇幅登在最后一版。
    这些报纸还以耸人听闻的题目写了许多污蔑中国的社论和评论。从3月21日到4月28日，“印度斯坦时报”就写了六篇社论和九篇关于西藏叛乱事件的评论。“印度斯坦旗报”写了九篇社论和四篇评论。“印度快报”一共发表了二十二篇社论和评论。这些报纸还发表了一些文章，公然表示支持“西藏为自由而进行斗争”。
    这些社论使用了帝国主义者咒骂中国时使用的那些恶毒的词句：“北京坚持无耻谎言的拙劣手法”；“班禅喇嘛是他们的走卒”；
  “中国的阴影投射在我们四周围的地方”；“共产帝国主义”；“对我们外交政策的基础加以现实的重新估价”。
    最近，某些社论开始荒诞地建议召开印度、中国、西藏“三方面的会议”来解决帝国主义和外国反动派策划的所谓“西藏问题”。在他们的把戏被揭穿以后，它们恼羞成怒地反咬中国一口，说这是“中国的战争姿态、中国的诽谤性攻击”。
