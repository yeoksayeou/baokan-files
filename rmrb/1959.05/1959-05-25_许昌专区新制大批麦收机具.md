Xuchang, May 24th (By our reporter) - The wheat in Xuchang Prefecture, Henan Province, has gradually ripened. Various types of harvesting machines newly manufactured in the prefecture are currently undergoing trial harvesting. To date, according to incomplete statistics, the entire prefecture has produced 790 harvesting machines and over 1,300 threshing machines. These harvesting machines generally improve efficiency by more than eight times compared to using sickles to cut wheat. The horse-drawn harvester trialed by the Hongqi Factory in Changge County can harvest 25 mu per day with two operators. One threshing machine can thresh over 6,000 jin per day, and the most efficient powered threshing machines can thresh over 10,000 jin per day. The cost of these wheat harvesting tools is also very low.

The Party and government organizations at all levels in the prefecture attach great importance to the trial production of harvesting and threshing machines. As early as the beginning of the year, they required all county, city, and commune-run factories to trial produce wheat harvesting and threshing machines. The county Party committees and commune Party committees each have one to several secretaries personally leading this work.

The faculty and students of the Beijing Institute of Agricultural Mechanization, who are working in the Xuchang area, are constantly helping the counties solve many technical problems in the trial production. The workers of each trial production factory have adopted methods such as "using local materials" and "using more wood and less iron" to greatly save the required amount of pig iron.

While vigorously grasping the trial production of wheat harvesting and threshing tools, Xuchang Prefecture also paid special attention to the repair, assembly and replenishment of small summer harvest farm tools. According to statistics as of May 15th, most of the more than 7 million small summer harvest farm tools needed in the district have been solved through "checking, digging, manufacturing, repairing, and reporting."

    许昌专区新制大批麦收机具
    本报许昌24日电　河南省许昌专区的大麦已经相继成熟，这个专区新制的各种式样的收割机，正在进行试割。到目前止，据不完全统计：全专区已经制出收割机七百九十部，脱粒机一千三百多部，这些收割机一般都比用镰刀割麦提高效率八倍以上。长葛县红旗工厂试制的马拉收割机，二人操作每天可收割二十五亩。一部脱粒机，每日可脱粒六千斤以上，效率最高的动力脱粒机，日脱粒达万斤以上。这些麦收工具造价也都很便宜。
    这个专区的各级党、政组织对试制收割脱粒机工作十分重视，早在年初，就要求各县、市和社办工厂，都来试制小麦收割、脱粒机。各县县委和社党委都有一个到几个书记亲自领导这一工作。
    下放在许昌地区的北京机械化学院的师生，不断地帮助各县解决试制中的许多技术问题。各个试制工厂职工都采取“就地取材”“多用木料少用铁”等办法大大节省了生铁的需要量。
    许昌专区在大抓小麦收割、脱粒工具试制的同时，还特别注意了对夏收小件农具的修配、添置工作。截止15日统计，全区需要的七百多万件小件夏收农具，经过“查、挖、制、修、报”等办法，已经绝大部分得到解决。
