Xinhua News Agency, 16th - Summary and Evaluation of the Second National Games of the People's Liberation Army by Lieutenant General Liu Zhijian, Deputy Director of the General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and Director of the Selection Committee for the Second National Games of the People's Liberation Army:

Comrades, Guests:

The Second National Games of the Chinese People's Liberation Army has victoriously concluded today. Our Games, under the correct guidance of the Central Committee's sports policy, with the help of the Beijing municipal Party and government organs and the people, and through the joint efforts of all the participants, has achieved its predetermined goals and completed the tasks of reviewing achievements, exchanging experiences, and selecting outstanding athletes. Here, on behalf of the General Political Department and the Games Selection Committee, I extend warm congratulations to all the athletes, referees, and staff!

The scale of this Games was very large, with many competition and performance events. In addition to all the events stipulated by the National Games, we also added armed swimming relays and military practical events based on the specific conditions of the army and in combination with combat training. There were a total of forty-four major events. Among them, twenty-two major events were held in Nanjing, Wuhan, Wuxi, Kaifeng, Pingliang, Dalian and other regions. Nearly ten thousand athletes and over one thousand referees participated in this Games. Such a large number of competition events, such a large sports contingent, and such a large-scale sports event are unprecedented in the history of our army.

The competition results of this Games are good. As a result of the competition, the Beijing Military Region team won the team first place in military practical events, wushu, Chinese wrestling, women's track cycling, and baseball; the Shenyang Military Region team won the team first place in football, gymnastics, freestyle wrestling, classical wrestling, and men's basketball; the Nanjing Military Region team won the team first place in men's shooting, weightlifting, women's track and field, and tennis; the Guangzhou Military Region team won the team first place in men's track cycling, women's swimming, men's fencing, men's archery, women's archery, men's volleyball, and table tennis; the Fuzhou Military Region team won the team first place in men's road cycling and badminton; the Jinan Military Region team won the first place in women's handball; the Lanzhou Military Region team won the team first place in men's horse racing and men's equestrian show jumping; the Inner Mongolia Military Region team won the team first place in women's equestrian show jumping; the Xinjiang Military Region team won the team first place in women's horse racing and polo; the Navy team won the team first place in men's swimming, armed swimming, men's diving, women's diving, women's road cycling, softball, water polo, and men's handball; the Air Force team won the team first place in men's gymnastics, women's gymnastics, and men's track and field; the General Headquarters team won the team first place in radio, women's shooting, motorcycle cross-country, motorcycle road racing, women's basketball, and women's volleyball; the Wuhan Military Region team won the second place in men's diving; the Kunming Military Region team won the second place in softball; the Tibet Military Region team won the second place in men's gymnastics; the Railway Corps team won the third place in women's volleyball; the Chengdu Military Region team won the fourth place in men's diving and women's shooting.

During this Games, eighteen events, forty-four individuals, and two teams broke world records and international competition records. During the Games, in the individual championship competition, Zhang Hong, a shooting athlete from the General Headquarters team, broke the national record and world record in the slow fire event with a small-bore free pistol with 567 rings; Han Haoye, a radio athlete from the Shenyang Military Region, Wu Liqing, a radio athlete from the Nanjing Military Region, and other comrades, exceeded the highest record in the International Radio Fast Telegraphy Friendship Competition in twenty-six person-times in fourteen events; Liu Litian of the Air Force team, with his model helicopter flying a straight-line distance of 18.038 kilometers, broke the international highest record of 11 kilometers for this item. Ren Cijian, Duo Liyun, and other sixteen comrades exceeded the achievements of the individual champions of the 1958 Leipzig First International Friendly Army Games in military practical events. The Navy team and the Nanjing Military Region team also exceeded the highest achievement of the 1958 Leipzig First International Friendly Army Games in armed swimming.

The Games also saw fifty events, one hundred and one individuals, and six teams break national records and create national best achievements. Huang Zhiyong, a track and field athlete from the Air Force, broke the national records in the 10,000-meter and 5,000-meter long-distance running; Li Jiyuan, a weightlifting athlete from the Kunming Military Region, broke the national record in the snatch of the lightest weight class; Yang Zhaoquan, a weightlifting athlete from the Lanzhou Military Region, broke the national record in the clean and jerk of the lightest weight class; Peng Guofu, an athlete from the Wuhan Military Region, broke the national record in the snatch of the middle weight class; Li Bingyou, a shooting athlete from the Nanjing Military Region, broke the national records in three events: the 50-meter to 100-meter 60-shot slow fire with a small-bore target rifle, the kneeling position in the three-position 40-shot event with a large-bore rifle, and the three-position 20-shot event with a military rifle; Zhu Jiaxin, a shooting athlete from the Shenyang Military Region, created the best national achievement in the rapid fire event with a men's military pistol; Bai Aijin, an athlete from the Nanjing Military Region, created the best national achievement in the slow fire event with a women's military pistol; Fu Junjie, a shooting athlete from the Air Force, and Cao Jingfen, a shooting athlete from the General Headquarters, exceeded the national highest achievement for men in the prone position with a women's small-bore free rifle; In the radio telegraphy competition, Wu Liqing from the Nanjing Military Region, Zhang Jinhua from the General Headquarters, and other comrades exceeded the national highest achievement in sixteen events with fifty-three person-times; Liu Yuhua, a parachuting athlete from the Navy, Wang Zhixian, a parachuting athlete from the Air Force, and other six comrades broke the national record in the daytime precision landing from 600 meters with aircraft parachuting; Peng Guangyu and other four comrades from the Air Force exceeded the national highest achievement in the daytime collective precision landing from 1,000 meters with aircraft parachuting. In addition, the Fuzhou, Shenyang, and Navy teams, and Zhao Xinquan and other comrades, exceeded the national highest achievement in three events, four team-times, and seven person-times in the multi-item sailing performance; Jiao Guilan and other comrades from the Navy exceeded the national highest achievement in three events and seven person-times in the motorboat performance; the Navy women's eight-person rowing team exceeded the national highest achievement; Xiribu from the Lanzhou Military Region, Ajiahan from the Xinjiang Military Region, and other comrades created the national highest achievement in eleven events and eleven person-times in equestrian competitions.

Among the competition achievements of the Games, the achievements in military practical events, radio telegraphy, shooting, and armed swimming were relatively remarkable. The performances of military events such as gliding, aerobatics, parachuting, motorcycle stunts, equestrianism, military relays, roller skating, and bayonet fighting, which were conducted during the Games, were well received by the audience. This shows that our army's military technology has a relatively fast development speed and a high level. It can also be seen that the military sports activities of the troops are carried out relatively well and are closely linked to combat and military training.

At the Games, other sports events also achieved certain results. More ball sports that are popular among the masses have also shown significant improvements in coordinated movements and technical level. The achievements in gymnastics, weightlifting, and other events have also improved to a certain extent. This shows that our army's sports movement has developed greatly in recent years.

A large number of new forces emerged at this Games, which is a very gratifying phenomenon. Some of the outstanding athletes selected in this competition are older athletes, and a large part are new forces. Among them, some are officers, some are soldiers, and some are employees serving in the army. For example, Yang Yuhua, the javelin champion, Guan Jinxiu, the women's shot put champion, Nan Yuerui, the first place in the men's military pistol 50-meter 15+60 slow fire shooting competition, Peng Guofu, who broke the national record in the snatch of the middle weight class, Han Haoye, who broke two international records in radio telegraphy, and many other outstanding athletes are all newcomers in the sports field. Yang Yuhua and Guan Jinxiu have only been learning to throw the javelin and shot put for a few months; Han Haoye is a new soldier who only joined the army in March 1958. In the competition of this Games, thirty-eight people reached the standard of national sports masters, and three hundred and forty-five people reached the standard of first-class athletes. The vast majority of them have not been engaged in sports activities for a long time, which shows that our army's athlete team has a strong reserve force and the development prospects of our army's sports movement are very broad.

In this Games, the performance in terms of sports ethics was also very good in general. During the competition, some athletes gave up scoring to protect their opponents from injury, and even injured themselves; In the competition, when the referee accidentally misjudged others, some athletes immediately came out to admit that they had fouled; The moving stories of mutual help before the game and mutual learning and exchange of experience after the game are even more common. The atmosphere of unity, friendship, mutual assistance and mutual learning between the teams and between the athletes is very strong. All this shows the high degree of collectivism spirit in the army's sports movement, and shows the new sports ethics and new sports style.

Although this Games has achieved relatively good results, it also shows that there are still some deficiencies in our army's sports movement, and the level of some sports is not high enough, especially the achievements in track and field and swimming are not outstanding enough, and the athletes' physical strength and endurance are not strong enough. This shows that our foundation is not solid enough, and our technical training is not good enough. To change the current situation of our army's sports movement and improve it on the existing basis, we must make greater efforts.

In the future, the sports movement of the troops must continue to implement the central government's policy and follow the instructions of Director Tan Zheng at the opening ceremony. Starting from the needs of the army, it must be closely combined with the nature and tasks of the armed services and branches of the army and the terrain and climate of the駐地, so that the army's sports movement directly serves to improve the quality of training and enhance the combat effectiveness of the troops; We must continue to carry out mass amateur sports, so that improvement and popularization are closely combined, promote the "Labor and Defense System" more widely, develop various sports activities, and attract and organize more people to voluntarily participate in sports exercises; We must make sports activities a part of the daily life of the vast number of commanders and fighters, and persevere in exercising regularly, in order to obtain more practical results.

Comrades, the Games has victoriously concluded. I hope that the athlete comrades who participated in the Games will not be arrogant in victory or discouraged in defeat, continue to work hard in training, bring back the spirit of the Games, and play a backbone role in the sports activities of the troops. I hope that the comrades who have been selected and are preparing to form the PLA delegation to attend the National Games will seize the time, work hard in training, and strive to achieve better results in the National Games.

Finally, I wish the army's sports movement a new development! I wish comrades new achievements!

    解放军二届运动大会总结讲评
    中国人民解放军总政治部副主任   解放军二届体育运动大会评选委员会主任  刘志坚
    新华社16日讯　中国人民解放军总政治部副主任、解放军第二届体育运动大会评选委员会主任刘志坚中将在人民解放军第二届体育运动大会上的总结讲评，全文如下：各位同志，各位来宾：
    中国人民解放军第二届体育运动大会，今天胜利地闭幕了。我们的大会，在中央体育方针的正确指导之下，在北京市党政机关和人民群众的帮助之下，在大会全体人员共同努力之下，达到了预定的目的，完成了检阅成绩、交流经验、选拔优秀运动员的任务。在这里，我代表总政治部和大会评选委员会，向全体运动员、裁判员、工作人员同志们表示热烈的祝贺！
    这次大会的规模很大，比赛和表演的项目很多，除全国运动会规定的全部项目外，还根据军队的具体情况，结合战斗训练，增加了武装泅渡接力和军事实用项目。共计四十四大项。其中二十二大项，分别在南京、武汉、无锡、开封、平凉、大连等地区进行了比赛。参加这次大会的有将近一万名运动员，一千余名裁判员。这样多的竞赛项目，这样大的一支体育队伍，这样规模的运动大会，在我军历史上是空前的。
    这次大会的竞赛成绩是良好的。比赛的结果，北京部队代表队获得了军事实用项目、武术、中国式摔跤、女子赛场自行车、棒球等项目的团体第一名；沈阳部队代表队获得了足球、技巧、自由式摔跤、古典式摔跤、男子篮球等项目的团体第一名；南京部队代表队获得了男子射击、举重、女子田径、网球等项目的团体第一名；广州部队代表队获得了男子赛场自行车、女子游泳、男子击剑、男子射箭、女子射箭、男子排球、乒乓球等项目的团体第一名；福州部队代表队获得了男子公路自行车、羽毛球等项目的团体第一名；济南部队代表队获得了女子手球第一名；兰州部队代表队获得了男子赛马、男子马术超越障碍等项目的团体第一名；内蒙古部队代表队获得了女子马术超越障碍团体第一名；新疆部队代表队获得了女子赛马、马球等项目的团体第一名；海军代表队获得了男子游泳、武装泅渡、男子跳水、女子跳水、女子公路自行车、垒球、水球、男子手球等项目的团体第一名；空军代表队获得了男子体操、女子体操、男子田径等项目的团体第一名；总直代表队获得了无线电、女子射击、摩托车越野、摩托车环行公路、女子篮球、女子排球等项目的团体第一名；武汉部队代表队获得了男子跳水团体第二名；昆明部队代表队获得了垒球第二名；西藏部队代表队获得了男子体操团体第二名；铁道兵代表队获得了女子排球第三名；成都部队代表队获得了男子跳水、女子射击等项目的团体第四名。
    这次大会有十八项、四十四人次、两队次打破了世界纪录和国际比赛的纪录。在大会期间，个人冠军赛中，总直代表队射击运动员张鈜小口径自选手枪慢射，以五百六十七环打破了国家纪录和世界纪录；沈阳部队无线电运动员韩浩野，南京部队无线电运动员吴立清等同志，在十四项比赛中，二十六人次超过了国际无线电快速收发报友谊竞赛中的最高纪录；空军代表队刘立天的航空模型直升飞机直线距离，以十八·○三八公里的成绩，突破了该项十一公里的国际最高成绩。任赐渐、朵里云等十六位同志在军事实用项目上，超过了1958年来比锡第一届国际友军运动大会个人冠军的成绩。海军代表队和南京部队代表队，在武装泅渡方面，也超过了1958年来比锡第一届国际友军运动大会的最高成绩。
    大会还有五十项、一百零一人次、六队次突破了国家纪录和创造了国家最高成绩。空军田径运动员黄志勇突破了一万公尺和五千公尺长跑的国家纪录；昆明部队举重运动员黎纪元突破最轻量级举重抓举的国家纪录；兰州部队举重运动员杨兆权突破最轻量级举重推举的国家纪录；武汉部队运动员彭国富突破中量级举重抓举的国家纪录；南京部队射击运动员李炳友突破小口径专用步枪五十公尺——一百公尺六十发慢射，大口径步枪跪射三乘四十，军用步枪三乘二十等三项的国家纪录；沈阳部队射击运动员朱家新男子军用手枪速射，创造了全国最优秀成绩；南京部队运动员白爱今女子军用手枪慢射，创全国最优秀成绩；空军射击运动员傅钧洁、总直射击运动员曹靖芬女子小口径自选步枪卧射，超过男子的此项运动的全国最高成绩；在无线电收发报竞赛中，南京部队吴立清、总直张锦华等同志，有十六项五十三人次超过国家最高成绩；海军跳伞运动员刘玉华、空军跳伞运动员王志先等六同志突破飞机跳伞六百公尺日间定点着陆国家纪录；空军运动员彭光裕等四同志飞机跳伞一千公尺日间集体定点着陆超过了国家最高成绩。此外，福州、沈阳、海军等代表队和赵新泉等同志，在航海多项表演赛中，有三项、四队次、七人次超过国家最高成绩；海军焦桂兰等同志，在水上摩托表演赛中，有三项、七人次超过国家最高成绩；海军女队八人赛艇，超过国家最高成绩；兰州部队希日布，新疆部队阿加汗等同志，在马术竞赛中，有十一项、十一人次创造了国家最高成绩。
    大会的竞赛成绩中，军事实用项目、无线电收发报、射击、武装泅渡等项目的成绩比较显著。大会中进行的滑翔、飞行特技、跳伞、摩托特技、马术、军事接力、滚轮、刺杀等军事项目的表演，获得了观众的一致好评。显示了我军军事技术具有较快的发展速度和较高的水平。也可以看出，部队的军事体育活动开展得比较好，和作战、军事训练的联系是密切的。
    在大会中，其他体育运动项目，也取得了一定的成绩。有更多的为群众所喜爱的球类项目，在协同动作和技术水平上也有显著的提高。体操、举重等项目的成绩，也有一定程度的进步。这说明我们部队的体育运动几年来有很大的发展。
    在这次大会上涌现了大批的新生力量，这是一个十分可喜的现象。这次竞赛中选拔出来的优秀运动员，一部分是比较老的运动员，有很大一部分是新生力量。他们中间，有的是军官，有的是士兵，还有的是在军队服务的职工。例如，标枪冠军杨玉华，女子铅球冠军管金秀，男子军用手枪五十公尺十五加六十慢射射击比赛第一名南岳瑞，中量级抓举破国家纪录的彭国富，无线电发报连破两项国际纪录的韩浩野以及许多优秀运动员，都是运动场上的新手。杨玉华学习投掷标枪，管金秀学习投掷铅球都只有几个月的时间；韩浩野是1958年3月才入伍的新战士。在这次运动会的竞赛中，达到国家运动健将级标准的有三十八人，达到一级运动员标准的有三百四十五人。他们绝大多数进行体育活动的时间并不长，这说明我军的运动员队伍有着雄厚的后备力量，我军体育运动的发展前途十分广阔。
    在这次大会上，体育道德方面的表现，总的来说，也是很好的。在竞赛过程中，有的运动员为了保护竞赛对方不受损伤，而自己放弃了得分，甚至自己还负了伤；竞赛中，当裁判员偶然错判别人时，有的运动员立即出来承认自己犯规；比赛前双方互相帮助，比赛后双方互相学习，交流经验的动人事例更为普遍。各代表队之间，各运动员之间，团结友爱、互助互学的风气十分浓厚。这一切都显示了军队体育运动中高度的集体主义精神，显示了新的体育道德和新的体育作风。
    这次大会，虽然取得了比较良好的成绩，但是也看出我们军队体育运动方面还有一些不够的地方，某些体育运动项目的水平还不够高，特别是田径和游泳的成绩不够出色，运动员的体力和耐力还不够强等。这可以看出我们的基础还不够坚实，我们的技巧训练还不够好。要改变我军体育运动的现状，使之在现有基础上提高一步，我们还必须作更大的努力。
    今后部队的体育运动，必须继续贯彻中央的方针，遵照谭政主任在开幕时的指示。要从军队需要出发，同军种、兵种的性质、任务和驻地的地形、气候等特点紧密结合，使军队体育运动，直接为提高训练质量、提高部队战斗力服务；要继续开展群众性的业余的体育运动，使提高与普及紧密结合，更广泛地推行“劳卫制”，发展多种多样的体育活动，吸引和组织更多的人自愿参加体育锻炼；要使体育活动，成为广大指战员日常生活中的一部分，经常坚持锻炼，以期获得更切实的效果。
    同志们，大会胜利闭幕了，希望参加大会的运动员同志们，胜者不骄，败者不馁，继续努力锻炼，把大会的精神带回去，在部队体育活动中，起骨干作用。希望被选拔出来，准备组成解放军代表队，出席全国运动大会的同志们，抓紧时间，刻苦锻炼，争取在全国运动会上取得更好的成绩。
    最后，祝全军体育运动有新的开展！祝同志们取得新的成就！
