The industry in the Taihang Mountains, nurtured by the Party, has seen great development over the past ten years. To date, the entire area has 226 state-owned and locally state-owned mechanized and semi-mechanized factories of various types, employing 126,970 workers. In 1958, the output value reached 270 million yuan, accounting for 45% of the total industrial and agricultural output value. During the Great Leap Forward and the people's commune movement in 1958, more than 8,000 new commune-run industries were established.

The Taihang Mountains are a treasure trove of rich industrial resources, with over 20 types of important minerals buried underground, including coal, iron, and sulfur, as well as over 70 types of light industrial raw materials such as yellow silk, ramie, and sugar beets. The coal reserves are estimated at approximately 18 billion tons, and the iron ore reserves contain 1.5 billion tons. As early as a thousand years ago, the hardworking people of the Taihang Mountains used these resources for handicraft production. Changzhi, Jincheng, and Yangcheng were major production areas for ironware in North China. Yin Town, located in the Lu'an Basin of Taihang, was known as "Wanli Yin Town" because its ironware sold well throughout the country. Due to the constraints of backward feudal society, cumbersome manual operations had been used for thousands of years, and there was no modern industry at all. After the start of the Anti-Japanese War, in order to supply our army with weapons and ammunition, the first arsenal in the Taihang Mountains was built in Huangyandong in this old base area. Although the factory only had a few dilapidated lathes at the time, thanks to the patriotic enthusiasm of the workers, it undertook the glorious task of manufacturing weapons and ammunition under the blockade and encirclement of the Japanese invaders, contributing to the victory of the Anti-Japanese War and sowing the red seeds for the development of modern industry in the Taihang Mountains.

The Great Leap Forward of 1958 spurred the industrial development here to take a "leaping horse" pace. The Huangyandong factory shone brightly in the Taihang Mountains, and its seeds sprouted and grew in every corner. The entire area developed 30 "small foreign groups" steel bases and developed a steel joint enterprise with a preliminary scale – Changzhi Iron and Steel Plant. Two large machinery factories developed from the Huangyandong factory have 10,000 employees. It has become the industrial backbone of the Taihang Mountains, capable of manufacturing various automatic lathes, universal tool milling machines, generators, electric motors, locomobiles, small tractors, high-pressure oil pumps, and precision computers, light sewing machines, supporting socialist construction. In 1959, the entire area will produce 210,000 tons of iron, 80,000 tons of steel, and 55,000 tons of steel. And 42 machine factories with modern equipment were established, distributed in various cities and towns, with 1,500 new lathes, with an annual production capacity of 25,000 tons. Forty-two power stations were also built throughout the area, spreading throughout the main towns of the Taihang Mountains, gradually realizing the ideal of the people here for many years – "lights do not need oil, and farming does not need cattle." In terms of the coal industry, the entire area has 36 pairs of machine-produced and semi-machine-produced mines, with an annual production capacity of 4.6 million tons. The light industry has also developed greatly, and the entire area has 94 light industrial factories with modern equipment.

The industry in the Taihang Mountains is advancing by leaps and bounds with a greater leap forward. This year, the total industrial output value of the entire region will increase by 70% compared to 1958. (Qin Xingshu) (Attached pictures)

    黄烟洞工厂播下的红色种子发芽成长
    太行山工业普遍发展
    本报讯　太行山上的工业，在党的一手培育下，十多年来有了很大的发展。到目前为止，全区已有国营、地方国营各种类型的机械化、半机械化工厂二百二十六个，职工十二万六千九百七十人；在1958年产值达二亿七千万元，占工农业总产值的45％。在1958年的大跃进和人民公社化运动中，新建立起来的公社工业达八千多个。
    太行山是一座有着雄厚工业资源的宝山，地下埋藏着煤、铁、硫黄等二十多种重要矿物，并出产黄丝、潞麻、甜菜等七十多种轻工业原料。煤的藏量约为一百八十亿吨，铁矿蕴藏有十五亿吨。早在一千年以前，勤劳的太行山人民就利用这些资源，进行手工业生产。长治、晋城、阳城是华北铁货主要产地，地处太行潞安盆地的荫城镇，由于铁货畅销全国各地，被群众称为“万里荫城”。由于落后的封建社会的束缚，千多年来一直沿用着笨重的手工操作，现代工业一无所有。抗日战争开始以后，为了供应我军武器弹药，在这个老根据地的黄烟洞，建起了太行山上的第一座兵工厂。这个工厂当时虽只有几个破旧的车床，但由于工人们的爱国热情，在日寇的封锁、包围下，担负了光荣的武器弹药制造任务，为抗日战争胜利贡献了它的力量，并给太行山上现代工业的发展播下了红色的种子。
    1958年的大跃进促使这里的工业发展跨上了“千里马”。黄烟洞工厂在太行山上大放光芒，它的种子在各个角落发芽成长。全区发展起三十个“小洋群”钢铁基地，并发展起一座初具规模的钢铁联合企业——长治钢铁厂。由黄烟洞工厂发展起来的两座大型机械厂，拥有万名职工，它成了太行山上的工业骨干，能够制造出各种自动车床、万能工具铣床、发电机、电动机、锅驼机、小型拖拉机、高压油泵和精密的计算机、轻巧的缝纫机，支援社会主义建设。1959年全区要产生铁二十一万吨，钢八万吨，钢材五万五千吨。并建立起四十二座有现代化设备的机械厂，分布在各个城镇，有一千五百台新式车床，年产能力二万五千台吨。在全区还建起四十二座发电站，遍及太行山各个主要城镇，正逐步地实现这里人民多年来的理想——“点灯不用油，耕地不用牛”。煤炭工业方面，全区有三十六对机器和半机器生产的矿井，年产能力达四百六十万吨，轻工业也有了很大的发展，全区有九十四个现代设备的轻工业工厂。
    太行山上的工业，正在以更大跃进的步伐，大踏步前进。今年全区工业总产值要比1958年提高70％。　（秦兴书）（附图片）
