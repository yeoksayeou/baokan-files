Xinhua News Agency, Hunan, 22nd: The vast rural areas of Hunan Province have entered the season of ripening wheat and beans, and fragrant rapeseed, and the summer harvest and planting work has begun intensely. In the past half month, it has rained every day, and more than one million farmers in various places have braved the rain to harvest and plant. In the fields, the commune members cooperated and competed to harvest one plot and plant another, striving to get all the bountiful spring harvest crops into their hands, while sowing the seeds for even greater harvests.

Currently, over three million mu of rapeseed in the province has been basically harvested. Six to seven million mu of wheat, broad beans, peas, potatoes, and other crops are being harvested. The spring harvest crops this year are generally better than last year. This is of great significance for supplementing food rations and encouraging the masses to strive for a bumper harvest of early and mid-season rice. Encouraged by the harvest, the masses are carefully and meticulously harvesting, striving to bring every grain home, and are also carrying out summer planting work in a timely manner. In the newly harvested rapeseed and wheat fields, they generally plow, fertilize, and transplant mid-season rice, summer sweet potatoes, and sow corn, soybeans, sorghum, and other miscellaneous grain crops immediately after harvesting. As of the 13th, the province had sown more than 3.75 million mu of corn and other miscellaneous grains, completing 78.3% of this year's planting plan. Although the area for mid-season rice has been increased by more than 2 million mu from the original plan, more than 70% of the expansion plan has also been completed.

Since May 1st, continuous rain has fallen for more than half a month in various places. Summer-ripening crops are prone to germination, and the tasks of harvesting and planting are heavy and time is tight. In some places, labor and tools are insufficient. Faced with this situation, people's communes in various places have organized production teams to uniformly arrange farm work and adopt methods of mutual assistance and labor exchange to rationally adjust labor and greatly accelerate the progress of harvesting and planting. The Taling Brigade of the Zhuanwan Commune in Wugang County planned to transplant mid-season rice on more than 2,100 mu of fields, of which 64% were rapeseed fields to be harvested. Relying solely on the 530 laborers in the entire brigade to harvest more than 1,340 mu of rapeseed fields and then transplant mid-season rice would take half a month, and the mid-season rice would not catch up with the growing season. The Commune Party Committee convened a cooperation meeting between the production brigades and signed a labor exchange and mutual assistance contract based on the principle of voluntary mutual benefit. Six production brigades sent more than 700 people, bringing their own rain gear, cattle, and farm tools, to help the Taling Brigade harvest more than 1,000 mu of rapeseed, and then plowed, fertilized, and transplanted mid-season rice, enabling the Taling Brigade to complete the tasks of harvesting and planting in three or four days. Wugang County universally adopted this form of labor exchange and mutual assistance, organizing more than 30,000 people to brave the rain to harvest more than 50,000 mu of rapeseed in the county in a few days.

In the simultaneous progress of several harvesting and planting farm tasks, various places generally implement a flow-line operation method based on the specialties of the commune members and the order of farm work, greatly improving work efficiency. More than 200,000 people from the people's communes in Bin County Prefecture who participated in the harvesting and planting campaign were divided into specialized organizations for harvesting, plowing, transporting fertilizer, transplanting rice seedlings, preparing soil, and planting sweet potatoes, implementing a flow-line operation method of harvesting, fertilizing, preparing fields, and transplanting rice seedlings or sowing other crops simultaneously, increasing work efficiency by one-third compared to previous years. In six days, the entire region braved the rain to harvest more than 150,000 mu of spring harvest crops and timely transplanted mid-season rice, sweet potatoes, and other crops.

In order to ensure that the spring harvest crops harvested in rainy weather can be well harvested and properly stored, Party committees at all levels in Xiangyin County convened meetings of veteran farmers to summarize and promote effective methods such as hanging, spreading, stir-frying, baking, pressing, and dividing. Hanging is to hang bundles of rapeseed stalks in ventilated places such as under the eaves. Spreading is to use indoor open spaces to dry them. Stir-frying is to stir-fry the threshed wet rapeseed and wheat in large pots to dry them. Baking is to promote the indoor heating and drying method. Pressing is to press the stir-fried rapeseed to extract oil. Dividing is to distribute a portion of the spring harvest crops to households for commune members to handle themselves. In this way, 93% of the county's more than 160,000 mu of spring harvest crops have been harvested and brought home, and most of them have been threshed, dried, and stored.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 22nd: More than 14 million mu of early-maturing barley and yuan wheat in Jiangsu Province have universally begun harvesting since the 18th. The vast number of farmers are joyfully throwing themselves into the first summer harvest battle since communization.

The Xinqiao People's Commune in Jingjiang County, Subei area, began harvesting "March Yellow" yuan wheat from the 13th, and harvested more than 1,000 mu of yuan wheat in three days. Because this commune implemented a series of high-yield measures from planting to harvesting, more than 6,000 mu of early-maturing yuan wheat grew very neatly, with tall stalks and large ears, a golden expanse. Commune members described the bumper harvest scene of early-maturing yuan wheat as: "The fragrance of wheat for ten miles intoxicates people." Someone wrote a bumper harvest folk song saying: "The warm wind turns the wheat waves, the fields flash golden light, the harvest sickle smiles, joyfully cutting 'March Yellow'." Changzhou Prefecture had harvested more than 65,000 mu of yuan barley by the 20th. The Weicun People's Commune in Wujin County of this prefecture began harvesting from the 11th, and the entire commune organized more than 1,600 laborers to rush to harvest yuan wheat, adopting the method of assigning tasks and setting work points per person, increasing work efficiency by 50%. Yangzhong County, known nationwide for its careful cultivation of three wheats, had harvested more than 40,000 mu of barley and yuan wheat by the 18th. In order to ensure careful harvesting and meticulous threshing, and that every grain is returned to the granary, this county prepared 1,400 drying grounds before harvesting wheat. The county also concentrated 90% of its labor force into the summer harvest campaign, with strong troops and sufficient food, to ensure a good first battle in the summer harvest. The Xushi and Zhaofeng People's Communes in Changshu County, Suzhou Prefecture, have started harvesting barley and yuan wheat since the 12th. On the afternoon of the 13th, commune members of the tenth production team of the first brigade of the Xushi Commune spent four hours cutting, threshing, and winnowing eight mu of yuan wheat. The total yield after weighing on the spot, basket by basket, was: 4,135 catties and twelve taels, averaging 516 catties and fifteen taels per mu. After this good news was announced, a burst of cheers erupted on the threshing ground. Seeing the trial harvest results of this plot, everyone believed that this year's wheat yield would be much higher than last year. Commune members of the Miaoqiao Commune formulated detailed plans for careful harvesting and meticulous threshing before harvesting wheat, and made preparations for harvesting wheat in rainy weather.

In order to better summarize the high-yield experience of three wheats, the Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China issued a notice on the 18th, suggesting that various localities seize the opportunity to select typical examples of large-area high yields of three wheats, with the county as a unit, and hold on-site meetings in separate areas to truthfully summarize the experience of large-area high yields and vigorously publicize the achievements of large-area high yields. At present, activities to summarize the experience of large-area high yields have begun in various parts of Jiangsu Province.

Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, 22nd: The first summer harvest campaign after communization on the Yunnan Plateau is unprecedentedly grand. From the thousands of miles of the southern border to the Wumeng Mountains in the interior, the wheat waves shimmered golden in the fields, and nearly a million laborers threw themselves into the battle to harvest wheat. Nearly 30% of the 5.9 million mu of wheat has been harvested. More than a dozen ethnic minorities such as the Dai, Miao, and Yi, who had planted wheat in large quantities for the first time in history, are all joyfully welcoming an unprecedented bumper harvest this year.

On both sides of the Red River in the southern subtropical area, the people of the Honghe Hani and Yi Autonomous Prefecture did not know how to grow wheat in the past. After the people's communes, they learned the experience of wheat sowing from the Han people in the interior, and adopted advanced sowing methods from the beginning, sowing more than 400,000 mu of wheat for the first time. This wheat grows as tall as a person's chest, and the heavy wheat grains are golden. Nearly 100,000 people from the state's summer harvest army have been mobilized to cut wheat, and about 50% has been harvested, with a higher yield per mu than last year. Yuxi, Qujing, and other prefectures and the Chuxiong Yi Autonomous Prefecture on both sides of the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, the main wheat-producing areas of Yunnan Province, have set off a climax of wheat harvesting. In the vast fields, hundreds of thousands of labor armies are harvesting meticulously day and night to ensure that every grain is returned to the granary. Nearly half of the more than 360,000 mu of wheat in Yuxi Prefecture has now been harvested, and the yield is better than last year. Zhaotong Prefecture on the northeastern plateau, where the wheat harvest season is later, has also begun harvesting. This year, due to the universal selection of improved varieties, most of the wheat in this prefecture is growing well. More than 2,000 mu of wheat harvested in Qiaojia County yielded 307 catties per mu, more than double last year.

In order to do a good job in this year's wheat harvest, Party committees at all levels have strengthened their leadership over the wheat harvest work. Xue Tao, the first secretary of the Qujing Prefectural Committee, went deep into the fields to carry out rush harvesting with the commune members. Each people's commune has a Party committee secretary and a person in charge of the management area and production team to specifically command the work of rushing to harvest wheat. Cadres of government organs, stationed troops, and students of primary and secondary schools are supporting the harvesting of wheat by adopting the methods of half-day labor and giving agricultural leave. The people's communes have also rationally organized and allocated labor, adopting the form of dividing the work and assigning responsibilities to each person, and combining big and small contract work teams to harvest wheat. During the intense harvesting, in order to achieve careful harvesting and meticulous threshing, and to return every grain to the granary, many commune members took out their own oilcloth and felt pads to lay on the ground while cutting wheat, so as not to let every grain of wheat fall on the ground. Each commune has prepared hundreds of temporary threshing grounds in the fields to achieve on-site harvesting, threshing, and loading. Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture has universally used threshing troughs in the fields while harvesting, which not only improved work efficiency, but also greatly reduced scattering and loss.

Now, on tens of thousands of wheat fields across the province, threshing machines are constantly rotating, and the abundant wheat grains flow like a spring into one bag after another, and then are immediately sent into the warehouse. It is estimated that by around May 25, wheat in most parts of the province will be harvested. (Attached picture)

    湖南百万农民奋战连阴雨抢收又抢种
    江苏长江南北麦香醉倒人普遍开镰收割“三月黄”
    云南高原上麦浪金光闪闪各族人民喜笑颜开割新麦迎丰收
    本报湖南22日电　湖南省广大农村已经进入麦黄豆熟、油菜芬香的季节，夏收夏种工作紧张地开始了。最近半个月来，每天下雨，各地出动了一百多万农民冒雨抢收抢种。田野里，社员们分工协作，你追我赶地展开竞赛，收一丘，种一丘，力争把丰收的春收作物全部拿到手里，同时播下更大丰收的种子。
    目前，全省三百多万亩油菜已经基本收完。六、七百万亩麦子、蚕豆、豌豆、马铃薯等作物正在收割。今年春收作物收成一般较去年好。这对增补口粮和鼓舞群众争取早、中稻大丰收，有很大意义。在丰收的鼓舞下，群众认真地细打细收，争取颗粒还家，而且及时进行夏播工作。在刚收割的油菜田和麦子地里，一般都随收随耕随施肥，栽插中稻、夏红薯和播种玉米、大豆、高粱等杂粮作物。到13日为止，全省已经播种玉米等杂粮三百七十五万多亩，完成今年播种计划的78.3％。中稻虽比原计划增加二百多万亩，也完成了扩种计划的70％以上。　　从“五一”节起，各地阴雨连绵半个多月，夏熟作物容易生芽，抢收抢种任务重、时间紧，有些地方劳力、工具都感不足。面对这种情况，各地人民公社组织各生产队统一安排农活，采取互助换工、协作支援的方式，合理调剂了劳动力，大大加速了抢收抢种的进度。武冈县转弯公社塔岭大队计划插中稻的二千一百多亩田，其中有64％是待收割的油菜田，单依靠全大队五百三十个劳力收完一千三百四十多亩油菜田再插上中稻，要半个月时间，中稻赶不上生长季节。公社党委会召开了各生产大队之间的协作会议，根据自愿互利的原则，签订了换工互助合同。六个生产大队出动七百多人，自带雨具、耕牛、农具，帮助塔岭大队抢收了一千多亩油菜，随即翻耕施肥插下了中稻，使塔岭大队在三、四天内就完成了抢收抢种任务。武冈全县普遍采取这种换工互助的形式，组织三万多人，几天中冒雨将全县五万多亩油菜收完。
    在抢收抢种的几项农活同时进行中，各地一般按社员特长和农活的先后实行分工分业的流水作业法，大大提高了工效。彬县专区各人民公社有二十多万人参加的抢收抢种大军，分成了抢收、翻耕、运肥、插秧、整土、栽红薯等专业组织，实行边收、边施肥、边整田、边插秧或播种其他作物的流水作业法，工效较往年提高三分之一。全区在六天中冒雨抢收了十五万多亩春收作物，并及时插下了中稻、红薯等作物。
    为了保证在雨天收割的春收作物能收好、保管好，湘阴县各级党委召开老农会，总结和推广了挂、摊、炒、烘、榨、分等有效办法。挂是在屋檐等通风地方，把油菜秆一束束晾起来。摊是利用室内空场摊干。炒是将脱粒的湿油菜子、麦子用大锅炒干。烘是推行室内加温烘干法。榨是将已炒干的油菜子榨油。分是将一部分春收作物分配到户，由社员自行处理。这样全县十六万多亩春收作物已有93％收割回家，大部分并已脱粒烘干储藏。
    本报南京22日电　江苏省一千四百多万亩早熟的大麦和元麦，从18日起普遍开镰收割。广大农民欢欣鼓舞地投入公社化后第一个夏熟丰收的战斗。
    苏北地区靖江县新桥人民公社，从13日就开始收割“三月黄”的元麦，三天内收了一千多亩元麦。这个公社由于贯彻了从种到收的一系列高产措施，六千多亩早熟元麦生长得十分整齐，秆高穗大，一片金黄。社员们形容早熟元麦的丰收景象是：“十里麦香醉倒人”。有人编了一首丰收歌谣说：“暖风翻麦浪，遍野闪金光，笑开丰收镰，喜割‘三月黄’。”常州专区到20日已割好六万五千多亩的元大麦。这个专区的武进县魏村人民公社，从11日起就开镰收割，全社组织了一千六百多个劳力抢收元麦，采取按人包任务、定工分的办法，工效提高了50％。以精心培植三麦闻名全国的扬中县，到18日为止，已收割了四万多亩大麦和元麦。为了精收细打、颗粒归仓，这个县在收麦之前做好了一千四百块晒场。全县在夏收前突击加工了四百多万斤口粮，并集中90％的劳力投入了夏收运动，兵强粮足，保证打好夏熟丰收的第一仗。苏州专区常熟县的徐市、兆丰等人民公社从12日起已经开始收割大、元麦。13日下午，徐市公社第一大队第十生产小队的社员，花了四小时工夫，将八亩田元麦割好掼好扬好，当场一箩一箩的过称。全部称好以后的总产量是：四千一百三十五斤十二两，平均每亩五百一十六斤十五两。这个喜讯宣布后，打麦场上响起了一阵欢呼声。看到这一块田的试收结果，大家认为今年麦子的产量要比去年高得多。妙桥公社的社员在收割麦子以前就订好细收细打的详细计划，并且做好了雨天收麦的准备工作。
    为了更好地总结三麦高产经验，中共江苏省委在18日发出通知，建议各地抓紧时机，以县为单位，选择三麦大面积高产典型，分片召开现场会议，实事求是地总结大面积高产经验，大张旗鼓地宣传大面积高产的成就。目前，江苏省各地总结大面积高产经验的活动已经开始。
    本报昆明22日电　云南高原上人民公社化后的第一个夏收运动盛况空前。从南面数千里国境线到内地乌蒙山脉上，田野里麦浪金光闪闪，有近百万个劳动力投入了抢收小麦的战役，五百九十多万亩小麦已经收割了近30％。有史以来第一次大量种植小麦的傣族、苗族、彝族等十多个少数民族，今年都兴高彩烈地迎接空前大丰收。
    南部亚热带地区的红河两岸，红河哈尼族彝族自治州人民过去不会种植小麦，在人民公社化以后，从内地汉族学来了小麦播种的经验，一开始就采用了先进的播种方法，第一次播种了四十多万亩小麦。这些小麦长得齐人胸高，沉甸甸的麦粒一片金黄。全州出动近十多万人的夏收大军割麦，已经收割了50％左右，亩产量比去年高。云南省小麦主要产区的滇越铁路两侧的玉溪、曲靖等专区和楚雄彝族自治州掀起了收割小麦的高潮。在广大田野里，几十万劳动大军披星戴月精收精打，保证颗粒还家。玉溪专区三十六万多亩小麦现已收割近半，产量胜过去年。麦收节令较迟的东北高原上的昭通专区也已开镰。今年这个专区的小麦，由于普遍地选用了良种，大部分成长良好。巧家县收割的两千多亩小麦，每亩实收三百零七斤，比去年提高一倍。　
　为了把今年的麦收工作做好，各级党委都加强了对麦收工作的领导。曲靖地委第一书记薛韬深入到田间与社员一道进行抢收。各个人民公社都由一个党委书记和管理区、生产队的一个负责人，专门负责指挥抢收小麦的工作。机关干部、驻军和中小学校的学生，采取半日劳动和放农忙假的办法，支援收割小麦。各个人民公社还合理地组织调配劳动力，采用分片包干和大小包工相结合的形式，收割小麦。在紧张的收割中，为了做到细收细打、颗粒还家，许多社员拿出了自己的油布和毡子垫着进行割麦，不让每一颗麦粒掉落地上。各个公社都在田边地间准备好了成百上千的临时打场，做到就地收、就地打、就地装好。德宏傣族、景颇族自治州，普遍使用了掼槽在田间边收边打，这样不仅提高了工效，还大大减少了抛撒散失。　　现在，全省数万个麦场上，打麦机正在不停地旋转，丰收的小麦麦粒像涌泉般地流入一个个口袋，接着就立即被送进了仓库。预计到5月25日左右，全省大部分地区的小麦就可以收割完毕。（附图片）
