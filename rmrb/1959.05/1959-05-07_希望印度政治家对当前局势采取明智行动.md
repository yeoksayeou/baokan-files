We fully agree with and support Premier Zhou's Government Work Report and the reports of Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen.

\tJust as representatives of all ethnic groups in our country are gathering in the capital to attend this National People's Congress meeting of great historical significance, characterized by great unity and a great leap forward, news has come from our friendly neighbor, India, of the so-called "Statement of the Dalai Lama" disseminated by Indian foreign officials. We feel immense anger at this statement, which openly betrays the motherland, slanders the Central People's Government, and advocates so-called "Tibetan independence."

\tTibet is an inseparable part of Chinese territory. This is an ironclad historical fact since the 13th century. The Tibetan ethnic group, like other ethnic groups in China, is a member of our great national family. In the past, the Tibetan people lived a tragic and impoverished serf life for a long time under the cruel rule of Tibetan landlords and nobles. Since the peaceful liberation of Tibet, more than 1.1 million Tibetan people have been able to see the light of day again, and together with all ethnic groups in the motherland, they are closely united under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao, and have begun to move forward on the road of economic and cultural development. This is in line with the highest interests of the Tibetan people and all ethnic groups in the country. The vast majority of Tibetan people wholeheartedly support and are jubilant about this. However, the former Tibetan local government and the upper-class reactionary group, in collusion with and under the instigation of imperialism and foreign reactionaries, have consistently engaged in activities that undermine unity and betray the motherland. They violated the Seventeen-Article Agreement and did everything possible to obstruct the work of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region. They regarded our Central People's Government's leniency and forbearance as weakness and dared to kidnap the Dalai Lama and openly launch an armed rebellion. Only then did the Central Government order the dissolution of the reactionary former Tibetan local government and resolutely suppress the rebellion in Tibet. We fully support all the measures and policies of the Central Government for quelling the rebellion in Tibet. We express our heartfelt congratulations and sincere condolences for the great victory of our People's Liberation Army in quickly quelling the rebellion in the Lhasa area and the bandits in the Shannan area. We firmly believe that through the rapid suppression of the Tibetan rebellion and the development of the work of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, the Tibetan people will forever get rid of the oppression of the upper-class landlords and nobles, end the tragic life under the serf system, and quickly embark on the bright road of prosperity and progress. We cheer for the happy future of the Tibetan people.

\tAfter our People's Liberation Army quickly quelled the rebellion in Lhasa, this small group of rebels continued to cling stubbornly to their evil ways, kidnapping the Dalai Lama, fleeing to India, continuing to collude with Indian expansionists, and fabricating this so-called "Statement of the Dalai Lama." The statement adopted the consistent tone of the imperialists, fabricating the demands of the Tibetan people, advocating so-called "Tibetan independence," and wantonly spreading rumors and slanders against our Central People's Government and the People's Liberation Army, which is truly shameless. As Representative Panchen said: "The Tibetan people understand from their personal experience that the inevitable result of breaking away from the motherland is not Tibetan independence, but turning Tibet into a foreign colony and protectorate." We fully agree with Representative Panchen's words. We believe that this statement is not the Dalai Lama's own will, but is imposed on him by others. This statement is of no help to the Tibetan rebel group, but only further exposes the ugly faces of foreign reactionaries.

\tSince the outbreak of the Tibetan rebellion, the imperialists have been gleefully thinking they have an opportunity and have engaged in large-scale provocative and slanderous propaganda, which is not surprising. The imperialists have always been trying to undermine the unity of all ethnic groups in China and the unity of Asian countries in order to achieve their aggressive goals. Now, Indian expansionists and some politicians are actually inheriting the past methods of British imperialism in invading Tibet, openly supporting the criminal activities of this small group of Tibetan rebels. At the beginning of the Tibetan rebellion, they openly expressed "sympathy" and constantly issued many absurd remarks slandering our country, which are no different from the old tunes sung by the imperialists in the past. Since the Dalai Lama was kidnapped to India by the rebels, Indian expansionists have been even more rampant in interfering in our internal affairs. They even used the rebellion of a small number of upper-class reactionary elements in Tibet as capital to openly provoke our country, attempting to realize their shameful conspiracy to split China. Obviously, this is a direct interference in our internal affairs and a very unfriendly act that violates the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. We issue a serious warning to this group of expansionists and some politicians in India.

\tIndia is our great friendly neighbor. For thousands of years, there have never been any conflicts between our two countries. After the founding of New China, the friendly relations between China and India have developed anew. The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence advocated by our two countries are fully in line with the interests of the people of both countries, and also with the interests of maintaining world peace, especially Asian peace. We have always adhered to this principle in our exchanges with India. If some politicians in India are truly friendly to China, they should welcome the victory of China in quelling the rebellion in Tibet; if they truly "sympathize" with the Tibetan people, they should be glad that they have gotten rid of the oppression of the upper-class reactionary group. Why stand on the side of the rebels, openly support and help their rebellious activities in Indian territory, and, like the imperialists, sing loudly the crazy talk of "Tibetan independence"? Isn't this blatant interference in China's internal affairs? Is this something that a politician of a friendly neighbor should do? Is this being a friend? It should be understood that the current China is not the old China that could be manipulated by others in the past. The Chinese people have stood up, and China has become a powerful country in the world. We have ample experience in fighting against imperialism in the past century, especially in recent decades. We can not only recognize who our true friends are and who our true enemies are, but also identify all the tricks they play and know what methods to use to defeat them. We solemnly warn the imperialists and foreign reactionaries that you should quickly pull back from the brink, stop those crazy activities of colluding with each other, interfering in our internal affairs, and undermining our national unity and the traditional friendship between China and India. If you still ignore the just call of the Chinese people, you will inevitably end up battered and bloody, just like all the imperialists in history. We hope that some politicians in India should clear their heads and take wise actions as soon as possible, otherwise they will not only be resolutely opposed by the Chinese people and the Asian and African countries, but will also suffer a shameful failure in front of the people of the world, and eventually end up in disgrace.

　　希望印度政治家对当前局势采取明智行动
　　丁履德　王深林　刘民生　刘先志　刘惠民　朱洗　李澄之  林遵　夏鼐　陈雷　张公制　张玺　周仁　徐佐夏  徐眉生　郭永怀　张含英　郭贻诚　童弟周　冯沅君　蔡邦华  金宝珍　酆云鹤　毕德显代表的联合发言
    我们完全同意并拥护周总理的政府工作报告和李富春、李先念副总理、彭真副委员长的几个报告。
    正当我国各族人民代表聚集首都，来参加这个具有伟大历史意义的，大团结、大跃进的全国人民代表大会会议之时，从我们友好的邻邦印度，却传来了由印度外交官员散发的所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”。对于这公开背叛祖国，诬蔑中央人民政府，鼓吹所谓“西藏独立”的声明，我们感到无比的愤怒。
    西藏是中国领土的不可分割的一部分。这是从十三世纪以来的铁一般的历史事实。西藏民族，和中国的其他各民族一样，是我国民族大家庭中的一个成员。过去藏族人民在西藏的地主贵族的残酷统治下，长期过着悲惨贫困的农奴生活。自从西藏和平解放后，一百一十多万藏族人民才得以重见天日，和祖国各民族一道，紧密团结在中国共产党、中央人民政府和毛主席的英明领导下，开始在发展经济和文化的道路上前进。这是符合于西藏人民和全国各族人民的最高利益的。绝大多数西藏人民无不竭诚拥护，欢欣鼓舞。但是原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团却在帝国主义和外国反动派的勾结指使下，一贯干着破坏统一，背叛祖国的勾当。他们破坏了十七条协议，百般阻挠西藏自治区筹委会工作的开展。他们把我们中央人民政府的宽大容忍等待认为是软弱可欺，竟敢劫持达赖喇嘛，公然发动武装叛乱。中央至此，才下令解散了反动的原西藏地方政府，坚决镇压西藏的叛乱。我们完全拥护中央对于平定西藏叛乱的各项措施和政策。我们对于我人民解放军迅速平定拉萨地区叛乱和山南叛匪的伟大胜利，表示衷心的祝贺和亲切的慰问。我们深信通过西藏叛乱的迅速平定，和西藏自治区筹委会工作的开展，西藏人民将会永远摆脱上层地主贵族的压迫，结束农奴制度下的悲惨生活，而迅速走上繁荣进步的光明大道。我们为西藏人民的幸福前途欢呼。
    在我人民解放军迅速平定拉萨叛乱之后，这一小撮叛乱分子仍然怙恶不悛，劫持达赖喇嘛，逃往印度，继续与印度扩张主义者狼狈为奸，并制造了这个所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”。声明采用了帝国主义者的一贯口吻，捏造西藏人民的要求，鼓吹所谓“西藏独立”，并且对我中央人民政府和人民解放军肆意造谣诬蔑，真是无耻之尤。正如班禅代表所说：“西藏人民根据切身的经验懂得：脱离祖国的必然结果，并不是什么西藏的独立，而是把西藏变为外国的殖民地和保护国。”我们完全同意班禅代表的话，我们认为这个声明不是达赖喇嘛本人的意志，而是别人强加于他的。这个声明对于西藏叛乱集团毫无所助，只是更暴露了外国反动派的丑恶面目而已。
    自从西藏叛乱事件发生以来，帝国主义者都兴高彩烈地认为有机可乘，大肆挑拨诬蔑的宣传，这是不足为奇的。帝国主义者从来就是无孔不入地破坏中国各民族的团结，破坏亚洲各国家的团结，借以达到它的侵略目的，现在印度扩张主义分子和某些政治家竟然继承英帝国主义过去侵略西藏的手法，公开支持西藏这一小撮叛乱分子的罪恶活动，在西藏叛乱事件发生之初，公开表示“同情”，不断发出许多诬蔑我国的荒谬言论，这些都是和帝国主义者过去唱过的老调毫无区别。自从达赖喇嘛被叛乱分子劫到印度以后，印度扩张主义分子更是猖狂地干涉我国内政。他们竟以西藏少数上层反动分子的叛乱作为资本，公开向我国挑衅，企图实现其分裂中国的可耻阴谋。很明显，这是直接干涉我国内政、违犯五项原则的极不友好的行为。我们对印度这帮扩张主义者和某些政治家提出严重的警告。
    印度是我们伟大的友好邻邦，几千年来我们两国从来没有发生过任何冲突。新中国成立后，中印的友好关系有了新的发展。我们两国所倡导的和平共处的五项原则是完全符合于两国人民的利益，也是符合于维护世界和平、首先是亚洲和平的利益的。我们在和印度的往来中，一向坚持这个原则。印度某些政治家如果是和中国真正友好，应该欢迎中国平定西藏叛乱的胜利；如果真正“同情”西藏人民，应该庆幸他们摆脱上层反动集团的压迫。为什么要站到叛乱分子一边，在印度国土内，公开支持帮助他们的叛乱活动，并且也跟帝国主义者一样，大唱其“西藏独立”的狂言乱语呢？这不是公然干涉中国的内政吗？这难道是一个友好邻邦的政治家所应做的事情吗？这是够朋友吗？应该了解：现在的中国不是过去可以任人摆布的旧中国了，中国人民已经站起来了，中国已经成为世界上强大的国家。我们在近百年特别是近几十年来，有和帝国主义进行斗争的充分经验，不但可以认清谁是我们真正的朋友，谁是我们真正的敌人，而且可以识别它们所玩弄的一切花招，知道用什么办法去战胜它。我们正告帝国主义者和外国反动派，你们应该赶快悬崖勒马，停止那些狼狈为奸，干涉我国内政，破坏我国统一和中印两国传统友谊的狂妄活动。如果你们仍然无视中国人民的正义呼声，你们将同历史上所有帝国主义者所遭受的下场一样，必然要碰得头破血流。我们希望印度某些政治家应该把头脑放清醒点，赶快采取明智的行动，否则不但要遭到中国人民和亚非国家的坚决反对，而且将在全世界人民面前，遭到可耻的失败，最后直至身败名裂为止。
