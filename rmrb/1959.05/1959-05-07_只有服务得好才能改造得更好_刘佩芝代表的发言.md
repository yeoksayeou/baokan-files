Chairman, fellow delegates, comrades:
I fully agree with and support the "Government Work Report" made by Premier Zhou and the reports made by other central responsible comrades at the conference. After listening to these reports, I am truly excited, and they have greatly educated and encouraged me. From these reports, I further realize that in 1958, there was a great leap forward in all aspects of socialist construction, an unprecedented great leap forward in the national economy in the history of our country, which has brought about extremely profound and tremendous changes in the material and spiritual outlook of our country. This is the result of the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao and the hard work of the working people. It is the victory of the general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results.
These reports will further mobilize the enthusiasm of all aspects, strengthen the great unity of the people of the whole country, and encourage the people of the whole country to fulfill and overfulfill the grand national economic plan for 1959. The task of us industrialists and businessmen is to strengthen transformation, actively serve, and fight together with the people of the whole country to achieve the continued leap forward in 1959!

Although there has been progress in self-transformation, duality still exists
In the past year or so, under the leadership and education of the Party, industrialists and businessmen in our Heilongjiang Province, like those throughout the country, have experienced the anti-Rightist struggle and the rectification movement, as well as the great leap forward in production. Most of our industrialists and businessmen have made varying degrees of progress through study, work, and labor training. In self-transformation, most people have improved their socialist enthusiasm. For example, private personnel in Harbin participated in the socialist labor competitions carried out by the industrial and financial and trade systems in 1958, and 535 private personnel were rated as advanced production (work) personnel at the factory (store), company, and municipal bureau levels. Generally speaking, industrialists and businessmen have made certain progress in self-transformation and serving socialism.
However, at present, the political stance of most industrialists and businessmen in our province has not been fundamentally transformed, and they are still in a transitional state of being in the middle, with duality still existing, and the problem of the struggle between the two roads has not been resolved. If compared with the soaring enthusiasm of the working people, their infinite loyalty to the Party, and their love for socialism, and measured by the six political criteria put forward by Chairman Mao, the problem becomes even more obvious. For example, some people have an attitude of being both close to and distant from the Party, with a certain sense of vigilance; when there are contradictions between certain Party policies and personal interests, they have doubts and resistance; some people follow the trend in advancing on the socialist road on the one hand, and on the other hand, they are still nostalgic for capitalism, so they have employment views, and they are "working without energy" and have an attitude of "it has nothing to do with me" towards the Great Leap Forward; some people despise labor and look down on the working people, regarding participation in physical labor as "forced by the situation" and "participating under orders," so they are physically in labor but mentally resentful; in accepting socialist transformation, some people admit the necessity of continuing to accept transformation on the one hand, and on the other hand, they have feelings of "disgust" and "resentment" towards transformation, and become complacent with a little progress and are unwilling to listen to transformation anymore. Some people also feel that accepting transformation is "unjust." The above shows that the fundamental transformation of the bourgeoisie in political ideology cannot be solved overnight or in a few movements, but is a relatively long, repeated, and arduous process. The views that the political stance of the industrial and commercial circles has been resolved after the anti-Rightist struggle and the rectification movement, that duality no longer exists, and that small households do not need to be transformed are all unfounded and therefore wrong.

Thorough transformation of industrialists and businessmen can only be achieved with the spirit of continuous revolution
Recently, after the industrialists and businessmen in our province were conveyed the spirit of the joint meeting of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce and the China Democratic National Construction Association and listened to the reports of local party and government leaders, we further realized that our industrialists' and businessmen's transformation is far from keeping up with the requirements of the development of the situation, and we must continue to strengthen the fundamental transformation in political ideology. We cannot think that since the private ownership of the means of production has been basically resolved, there is no need for transformation. As a class, it not only has its economic base, but also its superstructure—ideology and way of life. It cannot be said that the economic base has changed, which is equivalent to the elimination of this class. Nor can it be assumed that the political and ideological problems will be solved at the same time as the economic problems are solved. It must be recognized that it is not easy to change from one class (the exploiting class) to another class (the working class) in political stance. This change must go through the repeated process of practice, understanding, and re-practice, and must be achieved through continuous revolution. It cannot be regarded as an easy thing. At the same time, it must also be seen that today's situation is very favorable for strengthening self-fundamental transformation. There are many favorable conditions. Our industrialists and businessmen should have confidence that under the leadership and education of the Party, the goal of transforming from the bourgeois position to the working class position can be achieved. In order to achieve this goal, under the leadership of the Party, we must resolutely implement the transformation path of "taking political ideology as the commander, taking labor and work practice as the foundation, and taking enterprises and posts as the base," and combine the three. At present, our industrialists and businessmen must actively participate in the practice of the Great Leap Forward in production, contribute their talents and strengths, and strengthen their transformation in the process of active service. More transformation, more service, only good transformation can lead to better service. The process of service is the process of transformation, using transformation to promote service, and carrying out transformation in service. The two are mutually influential and mutually promoting. Without the transformation of political ideology, there is no way to talk about going all out and wholeheartedly serving socialism. Therefore, we must overcome the feelings of weariness about transformation and enhance the consciousness of self-transformation. Our industrialists and businessmen are in the great era of the leap forward development of socialist construction and socialist revolution in our motherland. Therefore, we must always bear in mind Chairman Mao’s cordial teaching: Recognize the laws of social development and master our own destiny. We must often use the working people’s infinite loyalty to the Party and socialism, and the soaring enthusiasm generated thereby, to encourage and spur ourselves. First of all, we must be loyal and honest to the Party and resolutely obey the leadership of the Party. This is a fundamental issue. If we are not honest or trusting to the Party, we will expand our distance from the Party, take two paths with the Party, and fall into the abyss of anti-Party and anti-socialism. Practice has proved that the process of our self-transformation is undulating and advancing tortuously. Therefore, only by loyally accepting the leadership of the Party can we transform ourselves, correct our direction, overcome all the problems encountered in the process of transformation, and continue to move forward. Our industrialists and businessmen should give their hearts to the Party, confide in the Party, and act consistently with their words. We should actively play our subjective initiative under the leadership of the Party, so as to improve the quality of service and the awareness of transformation, so as to gradually achieve the goal of fundamental transformation.

Any foreign support for Tibetan rebels is an interference in China’s internal affairs and an infringement on our country’s sovereignty
The industrialists and businessmen of Heilongjiang Province express great indignation at the armed rebellion launched by the former Tibetan local government and the reactionary groups of the upper class in collusion with imperialism, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and foreign reactionaries to betray the motherland and undermine unity. We resolutely support the State Council's order and measures to thoroughly quell the Tibetan rebellion. Tibet is Chinese territory, and quelling the rebellion of Tibetan reactionaries is China's internal affair, and no foreigners are allowed to interfere. Any foreign support for the armed rebellion of Tibetan reactionary elements is an interference in China's internal affairs and an infringement on China's sovereignty, which will never be allowed by our 600 million Chinese people.
1959 is the year of the 10th anniversary of the founding of our great motherland, and it is a decisive year in the three years of hard work. Under the correct leadership of the Party, the people of the whole country are in high spirits and striving to achieve a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in industrial and agricultural production and all aspects of construction. They have all made bold statements and written beautiful poems to praise the achievements of the great leap forward in production and labor, and to praise the glorious and lovely motherland. How great is the encouragement to us! We industrialists and businessmen are determined to strengthen transformation and actively serve along the road indicated by the Party and in accordance with Chairman Mao's teachings, and contribute all our strength to this year's continued great leap forward.

I wish the conference a complete success! Good health to all delegates!

### 只有服务得好才能改造得更好  刘佩芝代表的发言

　　只有服务得好才能改造得更好
    刘佩芝代表的发言主席、各位代表、各位同志：
    我完全同意和拥护周总理所作的“政府工作报告”和其他中央负责同志在大会上所作的报告。听了这些报告，真是使人兴奋，对我的教育和鼓舞是很大的。从这些报告中进一步认识到一九五八年社会主义建设各个方面都有了巨大的跃进，是我国历史上前所未有的国民经济大跃进，它使我们国家的物质面貌和精神面貌都发生了极其深刻而巨大的变化。这是党中央和毛主席的正确领导和劳动人民苦干的结果。是鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线的胜利。
    这些报告必将进一步调动各个方面的积极性，加强全国人民的大团结，鼓舞全国人民完成和超额完成规模宏大的一九五九年国民经济计划。我们工商业者的任务，就是要加强改造，积极服务，同全国人民一起为实现一九五九年的继续跃进而斗争！
    自我改造虽有进步，两面性仍然存在
    一年多来，我们黑龙江省工商业者和全国一样，在党的领导和教育下，经历了反右派斗争和整风运动，以及生产大跃进，我们工商业者中的多数人通过学习、工作和劳动锻炼，有了不同程度的进步。在自我改造中，多数人都提高了自己的社会主义积极性，如哈尔滨市私方人员一九五八年都参加了工业和财贸系统开展的社会主义劳动竞赛，其中有五百三十五名私方人员被评为厂（店）、公司和市局一级的先进生产（工作）者。从总的方面来看，工商业者在自我改造和为社会主义服务方面，都有了一定的进步。
    但目前我省工商业者多数人的政治立场还没有得到根本改造，仍处于中间地位过渡状态，两面性仍然存在，两条道路的斗争问题还没有解决。如果和劳动人民的冲天干劲、对党的无限忠诚和热爱社会主义来比较，和以毛主席提出的六项政治标准来衡量，问题就更为明显。如有些人对党的态度是若即若离，存在着一定的戒备心理；对待党的某些方针政策和个人利益有矛盾时，就产生怀疑和抵触情绪；有些人对走社会主义道路是一面随大流前进，另一面还留恋资本主义，因而存在雇佣观点，对工作是“干而无劲”，对大跃进抱着“与我无关”的态度；有些人卑视劳动，轻视劳动人民，把参加体力劳动看成是“形势逼人”、“奉命参加”，因而身在劳动心在怨；在接受社会主义改造上，有些人一方面承认继续接受改造的必要，另一方面对改造又存在着“厌”与“怨”的情绪，稍有进步就自满起来，不愿再听改造。也有的人觉得接受改造“冤屈”。以上这些说明资产阶级分子在政治思想上的根本改造，不是一朝一夕、几个运动就可以解决了的，而是一个较长期的、反复的、艰巨的过程。那些认为工商界在反右派斗争和整风运动后，政治立场问题已经解决了、两面性已经不存在了、小户不用改造了的看法都是没有根据的，因而是错误的。
    工商业者彻底改造，要有不断革命的精神才能达到
    最近我省工商业者经过了民建中央和全国工商联两会联席会议精神的传达和听了地方党政首长的报告后，使我们进一步认识到我们工商业者的改造远远跟不上形势发展的要求，还必须继续加强政治思想上的根本改造。不能认为生产资料私有制已经基本解决了，就没有什么改造的必要了。作为一个阶级来说，不只有它的经济基础，而且还有它的上层建筑——意识形态和生活方式。不能说经济基础改变了，就等于这个阶级被消灭了。也不能设想在解决了经济问题的同时就也解决了政治思想问题。必须认识到在政治立场上从一个阶级（剥削阶级）转到另一个阶级（工人阶级），这个变化更不是容易的，它必须要经过实践、认识、再实践的反复过程，必须不断革命才能达到的，是不能看成轻而易举的事情。同时也要看到今天的形势对加强自我的根本改造是非常有利的，有利条件很多，我们工商业者应该有信心，在党的领导和教育下，是可以达到从资产阶级立场改造成为工人阶级立场上来的目标。为了达到这个目标，必须在党的领导下，坚决贯彻“以政治思想为统帅、以劳动和工作实践为基础、以企业和岗位为基地”的改造途径，并把三者结合起来。目前我们工商业者就是要积极投入生产大跃进的实践中去，贡献自己的才能和力量，在积极服务过程中加强改造自己。多一分改造，多一分服务，只有改造得好，才能服务得更好。服务的过程就是改造过程，以改造推动服务，在服务中进行改造，两者是互相影响，互相促进的。没有政治思想的改造，就根本谈不到鼓足干劲，一心一意的为社会主义服务。因此我们必须克服对改造的厌倦情绪，增强自我改造的自觉性。我们工商业者正处在祖国的社会主义建设和社会主义革命飞跃发展的伟大时代里，因此我们每时每刻都要牢记毛主席的亲切教导：认清社会发展规律，掌握住自己的命运。我们要经常以劳动人民对党和社会主义的无限忠诚、以及由此所产生的冲天干劲来鼓舞和鞭策自己。我们首先要对党忠诚老实，坚决服从党的领导，这是根本问题。对党不老实、不信任，就会扩大自己同党的距离，就会同党走两条道路，就会陷入反党反社会主义的深渊中去。实践证明，我们的自我改造的进程是波浪起伏，曲折前进的。因此只有忠诚的接受党的领导，我们才能改造自己，才能端正方向，克服改造过程中遇到的一切问题，才能不断前进。我们工商业者都应向党交实心，同党推心置腹，作到言行一致。我们应该在党的领导下积极发挥主观能动性，从而提高服务质量与改造的自觉性，以逐步达到根本改造的目的。
    任何外国人对于西藏叛乱分子的支持，都是对中国内政的干预，侵犯我国的主权
    我们黑龙江省工商业者对原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团勾结帝国主义、蒋介石匪帮和外国反动派所发动的背叛祖国，破坏统一的武装叛乱，表示极大的愤慨。我们坚决拥护国务院的彻底平息西藏叛乱的命令和措施。西藏是中国的领土，平定西藏反动分子的叛乱是中国的内政，不允许任何外人干涉。任何外人对于西藏反动分子武装叛乱的支持，都是对中国内政的干预，侵犯中国的主权，是我们六亿多中国人民决不容许的。
    一九五九年是我们伟大祖国国庆十周年的一年，是苦战三年中有决定性的一年，全国人民在党的正确领导下，都在精神振奋，争取实现工、农业生产及各方面建设的更大、更好、更全面的大跃进，都发出了豪言壮语，写下了美丽的诗歌，歌颂生产、劳动大跃进的成果，歌颂辉煌灿烂可爱的祖国，这对我们的鼓舞是多么大呀！我们工商业者坚决沿着党所指示的道路，遵照毛主席的教导，加强改造，积极服务，在今年的继续大跃进当中贡献出全部力量。
    祝大会胜利成功！各位代表身体健康！
