Xinhua News Agency, 10th—The famous Hungarian Aeromodelling Team gave its first splendid model aircraft flying performance at the Beijing Aviation Club this morning, which was warmly welcomed by more than 7,000 Beijing spectators.

The leader of the Hungarian Aeromodelling Team, Beck, and all the team members, five Hungarian aeromodelling athletes: Benedict, Toth, Eger Valley, Old Dog, and Azure, participated in the performance. The items they performed included five categories: line-controlled piston engine model aircraft group, speed racing, stunt flying, air combat, and line-controlled jet engine model aircraft speed racing.

The model aircraft "air combat" performance by Eger Valley, the 1958 Hungarian Model Aircraft Stunt Flying Competition champion, and former Hungarian champion Old Dog, aroused great interest among the audience. The two model aircraft controlled by them chased each other in the air, sometimes up and sometimes down, like a fierce air battle. They both tried to use the propeller of the model aircraft to cut off a long ribbon trailing from the tail of the other's model aircraft. In the end, Eger Valley cut off the ribbon behind the model aircraft controlled by Old Dog and won the victory. Their superb performance skills won warm applause from the audience.

After watching the performance, Vice Chairman Dong Biwu, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and Vice Premiers Deng Xiaoping, He Long, and Chen Yi went to the performance field to meet with all the members of the Hungarian Aeromodelling Team.

Hungary has a very high level of aeromodelling. Out of the twenty-five world records in aeromodelling competitions, Hungarian athletes hold eleven. Benedict, who has repeatedly set Hungarian and world records, reached a speed of 250 kilometers per hour today while performing line-controlled jet model aircraft.

Our country's glider athletes also held a glider flying performance for the guests today.

The Hungarian Aeromodelling Team will hold another performance in Beijing on May 14.

    我国家领导人接见匈队全体人员
    新华社10日讯　著名的匈牙利航空模型运动队，今天上午在北京航空俱乐部举行了第一次精采的模型飞机飞行表演，受到了七千多名北京观众的热烈欢迎。
    匈牙利航空模型运动队领队别克和全体队员、五名匈牙利航空模型运动健将班尼迪克、托特、埃格尔瓦利、奥尔多格和阿左尔，都参加了表演。他们表演的项目包括线操纵活塞式发动机模型飞机小组、竞速、特技飞行、空战和线操纵喷气式发动机模型飞机竞速飞行等五类。
    匈牙利1958年模型飞机特技飞行比赛冠军埃格尔瓦利和前匈牙利冠军奥尔多格的模型飞机“空战”表演，引起观众极大兴趣，他们两人操纵的两架模型飞机在空中相互追逐，忽上忽下，犹如一场激烈的空战，他们彼此都想办法用模型飞机的螺旋桨，切断对方模型飞机尾部拖着的一条长绸带。最后，埃格尔瓦利切断了奥尔多格操纵的模型飞机后的绸带，获得胜利。他两人高超的表演技巧，博得了观众的热烈的掌声。
    董必武副主席，彭真副委员长，邓小平、贺龙、陈毅副总理在观看了表演以后，都到表演场接见了匈牙利航空模型运动队全体人员。
    匈牙利的航空模型运动水平很高，在二十五个航空模型比赛的世界纪录中，匈牙利选手保持了十一个。多次创造匈牙利纪录和世界纪录的班尼迪克，今天在表演线操纵喷气式模型飞机时，时速曾达到二百五十公里。
    我国的滑翔机运动员今天也为客人们举行了滑翔机飞行表演。
    匈牙利航空模型运动队5月14日还将在北京举行一次表演。
