Xinhua News Agency, 16th. According to the West German "Die Welt": While the Foreign Ministers of the Four Great Powers and the Foreign Minister of the German Democratic Republic were discussing issues of vital interest to the German nation in the Palais des Nations in Geneva, "(West German) Foreign Minister Brentano was staying in a former private villa of a Turkish monarch on the outskirts of the city."

On the 14th, at the invitation of some photographers, Brentano "played" the role of a Foreign Minister in a "tableau vivant." The newspaper described this "tableau vivant" in detail: "In the beginning, he sat in a deep blue armchair with a canopy, reading a newspaper," "Then, the photographers asked him to go to the open lawn." "He looked out at the distant Arve Valley, and in the mist, the blue-gray rocks of Mont Salève could be faintly discerned, and the steel ropes of the cable car on the summit sparkled like silk. In this intoxicating scenery, Brentano had to act out the demeanor of a statesman as imagined by the reporters. He paced alone on the lawn, lost in thought, seeing and hearing nothing. He strolled in the morning light with his hands clasped behind his back, head bowed, like Atlas from Greek mythology, punished to bear the sky on his shoulders."

The newspaper said, "Then, a secretary approached the minister, interrupted his reverie, and brought him back to earth. The secretary handed him a copy of 'Die Welt,' which the minister now had to read while walking."

"Then, he had to sit down with his secretaries and discuss the major events in the newspaper and handle some official documents. Among these documents was one specially prepared by the (West) German Consulate in Geneva for the (West German) representatives attending the Geneva Conference, introducing the most beautiful scenic spots in Geneva and those restaurants famous for their best cuisine, but in these reports with pictorial descriptions, there will definitely be official documents from the US Secretary of State."

    勃伦塔诺穷极无聊
    蹲在别墅打发日子
    新华社16日讯　据西德“世界报”报道：正当四大国外长和德意志民主共和国外长在日内瓦国联大厦讨论有关德意志民族切身利害的问题的时候，“（西德）外交部长勃伦塔诺住在这个城市郊外的一所以前是土耳其君王的私人别墅里。”
    14日，勃伦塔诺应一些摄影记者的邀请，在一幕“活报剧”中“扮演”了一位外交部长。这家报纸详细地描述了这幕“活报剧”：“开始的时候，他坐在一把带有凉篷的深蓝色靠椅上读报”，“接着，摄影记者请他到开阔的草坪上去。”“他眺望远处的阿维山谷，在薄雾中可以依稀辨认出萨勒夫山的青灰色山岩，山顶索道上的钢绳像丝绸一样闪闪发光。在这种醉人的景色里，勃伦塔诺不得不按照记者们所想像的来表现出一个政治家的风度。他在草坪上独自踱着步，堕入深思之中，看不见也听不到任何事物。他在晨曦中背叉着双手低头蹓跶着，活像希腊神话中被处罚而掮着天的阿特拉斯神一样。”
    这家报纸说，“然后，一位秘书走向这位部长，打断了他的忧思，把他唤回到尘世中。秘书交给他一份‘世界报’，这是这位部长现在必须边走边看的东西。”
    “然后，他必须坐下来和秘书们一起谈论报纸上的大事，并且处理一些公文。其中有一份公文是（西）德国驻日内瓦领事馆专门为出席日内瓦会议的（西德）代表们所特地准备的，介绍日内瓦最优美的风景区和以最好的烹饪而著名的那些酒家，但是，在这些有图片说明的报告中，肯定会有美国国务卿的公文。”
