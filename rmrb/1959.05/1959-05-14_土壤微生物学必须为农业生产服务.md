The Utility of Soil Microorganisms

Soil microbial activity is a complex process, a unity of opposites. On one side is decomposition, and on the other is synthesis; on one side is consumption, and on the other is accumulation. From the physical and chemical weathering of the Earth's surface, to the beginning of biological activity, the processes of decomposition and synthesis, consumption and accumulation of soil microorganisms, always develop in a direction that is beneficial to the growth of higher plants.

First of all, there is the accumulation of nitrogen in the soil. There is no nitrogen in the weathered rock, that is, the parent material of the soil. However, the air contains 70% nitrogen. Although plants grow in the air, they do not have the ability to use free nitrogen molecules in the air, and can only use nitrogen-containing compounds in the soil. The most important thing to fix free nitrogen molecules in the air in the form of compounds in the soil is through the activity of soil microorganisms. We know that many kinds of microorganisms have this nitrogen fixation ability, such as free-living nitrogen-fixing bacteria, certain fungi, rhizobia, and other microorganisms. The nitrogen fixed by microorganisms cannot be directly used by plants, and must be decomposed by other kinds of microorganisms to convert organic nitrogen into inorganic substances such as ammonia or nitrate nitrogen, before it can be absorbed and utilized by plants. In addition to nitrogen, the activity of soil microorganisms also produces and accumulates many other things needed for plant life that were not originally present in the soil, such as antibiotics, plant growth hormones, enzymes, and other organic substances. More than 80% of the substances in soil humus are synthetic products of microbial activity. Neither the chemical changes in the soil parent material, nor the decomposition of plant organisms, can produce these kinds of things. The more fertile the soil, the more humus accumulates. Secondly, soil aggregate structure depends decisively on microorganisms. Simple physical and chemical changes in the parent material of the soil cannot form aggregates. The formation of aggregates mainly lies in the biochemical changes in the soil.

The decomposition action of soil microorganisms is no less important than its synthesis process. Every year, a large number of plant leaves, residual roots, trunks, animal carcasses, etc. accumulate on the surface of the earth. Although these things increase year after year, they do not accumulate on the surface of the earth forever, but "disappear" unconsciously. This disappearance process is mainly the decomposition process of microorganisms. Soil microorganisms convert animal and plant remains into organic acids, monosaccharides, and even simple compounds such as water and carbon dioxide. In the process of carbon conversion, plants use the sun's energy to synthesize carbohydrates from water and carbon dioxide, while soil microorganisms decompose them into their original substances, using the thermal energy and carbon contained in them. On the other hand, in the process of nitrogen conversion, soil microorganisms constantly fix nitrogen from the air, decompose organic matter, and release the nitrogen contained in them, turning them into substances that plants can use. In addition to the conversion of nitrogen and carbon, the conversion of organic phosphorus and insoluble inorganic phosphorus, the conversion of potassium, sulfur, iron, and other substances, and the decomposition of toxic substances to plants in the soil are all closely related to the activity of soil microorganisms. Therefore, when studying soil, we cannot ignore the activity of soil microorganisms. This activity has a decisive effect on soil formation and the growth of higher plants. In fact, soil is the loose and fertile surface layer of land, and is the product of human labor. Whether the surface layer of the earth's crust is loose or not reflects the degree of weathering of the rock. Whether the soil is fertile or not mainly lies in a series of biological activities and material conversions. Whether the soil can exert its fertility and grow the crops necessary for human survival depends entirely on human social labor. These three main factors are related to the occurrence, development, utilization, and improvement of soil. Ignoring any of these will lead us to a metaphysical path.

It is wrong to regard soil as a product of weathering

The utility of soil microorganisms is not acknowledged by all agricultural science workers. A few people still deny this role based on prejudice and regardless of the truth. Some other scientific workers absolutize and extremize the role of soil microorganisms. The former denies the role of soil microorganisms in the soil formation process, saying that soil is the product of rock weathering. In terms of plant nutrition, they believe that soil microorganisms "compete" with plant roots for nutrients, deny the role of organic fertilizers and bacterial fertilizers, one-sidedly emphasize the role of agricultural chemistry, and regard soil as a dead thing; they regard plant absorption of nutrients from the soil as a simple physical absorption process, or chemical change process. This view had a written theory as early as the eighteenth century, namely the "Law of Return" and the "Law of Diminishing Soil Fertility." According to the first "law," it seems that whatever crops "take away" from the soil, they must return to the soil. Although this law has long been criticized, there are still a few people who are very superstitious about it, so that when discussing production targets, some people often first calculate how much nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium the crops need to take away from the soil in order to achieve a certain yield target, and then calculate how much fertilizer is needed based on this figure. The conclusion is "No, no! If so much fertilizer is applied, the salt content of the soil will increase and the plants will not be able to absorb it." That is to say, the yield of crops is limited by natural laws and cannot be increased any further. At the same time, this argument also reflects the idea of the "Law of Diminishing Soil Fertility," that is, according to this law, it seems that the more fertilizer and processing are applied to the soil, the less the harvest will be. The scientific basis of this "law" is: "Soil is the product of rock weathering," and this product becomes increasingly poor after long-term wind and rain leaching, with the result that the soil develops in the direction of decay. Although Lenin systematically criticized this fallacy, there are still a few scientific workers who refuse to abandon it, but have changed from public propaganda to "black market" sales. For example, some people believe that deep plowing mainly accelerates the soil weathering process and releases phosphorus and potassium nutrients, saying that deep plowing cannot increase aggregate structure and cannot increase organic matter and nitrogen. The significance of deep plowing to improve soil is reduced to merely the mechanical effect of accelerating the weathering process. This is an unscientific and metaphysical point of view. In fact, the accumulation of organic matter and nitrogen in the soil is not a mechanical question of how much is added or subtracted, but a series of biological and other physical and chemical changes. Deep plowing and fertilization are precisely to accelerate this process and make it develop in a direction that is beneficial to crop growth, so that the fertility of the soil is improved day by day.

It is arbitrary to regard soil as the digestive system of plants

Those opinions that absolutize and extremize the utility of soil microorganisms are also not treating the truth with a scientific attitude. They arbitrarily say that soil microorganisms are the digestive system of higher plants. It seems that everything that plants absorb from the soil must be processed by soil microorganisms. Therefore, some microbial workers criticized this "digestive system theory," saying: "The things decomposed by soil microorganisms are nothing more than organic matter or inorganic salts, and the fertilizers we apply also contain inorganic salts. Does it mean that plants only choose the inorganic salts with the 'microbial processed' mark when absorbing inorganic salts?" (Darosinsky) This accusation is correct. The role of soil microorganisms in the life of higher plants is huge and decisive, but not absolute.

We believe that the former view that regards soil as a weathering product is wrong, and is pushing soil science back to the foundations before the eighteenth century to talk about science. The latter view that regards soil microorganisms as the "digestive system" of plants is arbitrary, and is making a hasty conclusion to scientific questions that have not yet been revealed.

An incorrect understanding of the utility of soil microorganisms will lead the work of studying soil microbiology astray. The two views mentioned above seem to be incompatible, but they have one thing in common, that is, science for the sake of science. Soil microbiology was originally a science closely related to agricultural production, but it has been moved to the platform of idle talk by a few so-called theorists. Soil microbiology workers are keen on writing books and keen on the classification and naming of soil microorganisms. Some microbial workers spend several years observing a piece of land less than one-tenth of an acre, for the purpose of finding out the curve of changes in the number of certain microorganisms, so as to write a sensational paper. As for how much value this paper has for agricultural production, the researcher himself is not clear.

Soil microorganisms can be improved and utilized

The study of soil microbiology must be combined with agricultural production. We should study how to strengthen the activity of microorganisms in the soil to promote the decomposition of organic matter, ensure the needs of plant nutrition, how to strengthen the synthesis of new organic matter in the soil, how to increase the aggregate structure of the soil, and how to make the fertility of the soil improve day by day. In addition to beneficial microorganisms, there are many microorganisms in the soil that are unfavorable to crop growth, such as pathogens, etc., how to eliminate them. In short, we should study how to transform soil microorganisms to serve agricultural production. This is not a fantasy, but something that can be done completely. We have isolated more than 100 kinds of bacteria from the suburbs of Beijing, Tianjin, Northeast China, Nanjing and other places, and then inoculated them into the soil. As a result, the yield of corn increased by more than 20%. In the pot experiment of wheat and single bacteria, most of the bacteria can make wheat seedlings (twenty-one days) grow one-third to one-half more than the control without inoculation. Interestingly, the inoculated bacteria occupy an absolute advantage in the soil, and the number of bacteria originally in the soil is greatly reduced. This fact tells us that soil microorganisms can be improved and utilized. That is to say, it is entirely possible for us to replace the original microorganisms in the soil with microorganisms that are beneficial to crops. The types of microorganisms in the soil are not the result of natural development, but are constantly changing and developing under the influence of cultivation and crops. It is entirely possible for people to grasp the direction of this development and change, and use it to serve agricultural production.

We have initially observed the changes of soil microorganisms after deep plowing. Before deep plowing, the situation of soil microorganisms was that the upper layer was more than the lower layer, and the lower the layer, the smaller the number. Deep plowing broke this "law", the number of microorganisms in the upper and lower layers has tended to be consistent, and has increased hundreds to thousands of times compared with before deep plowing. Due to the vigorous activity of microorganisms, the soluble nutrients in the soil have been significantly improved. For example, due to the relationship of fertilization, the total nitrogen and total phosphorus in the deep plowing land increased three to four times compared with the control land. While soluble ammonia and phosphorus increased six to seven times. This is a concrete manifestation of the familiarization of raw soil. As for what measures should be taken to further utilize soil microorganisms to accelerate the familiarization of raw soil, this is a practical question for agricultural production.

In addition to studying the relationship between soil microorganisms and soil fertility, we must also study the relationship between soil microorganisms and crops. Soil microorganisms are closely related to the types and growth stages of crops. The period of vigorous crop growth is also the time when soil microorganisms are most active, especially the microorganisms around the crop roots, which are hundreds to thousands of times more numerous than in other soils. In recent years, some scientific workers abroad have made preliminary observations on the microorganisms on the roots of crops, proving that the bacteria on the roots of dry land crops such as wheat, corn, cotton, and pasture are basically a type of non-spore-forming bacteria. They have a high denitrification effect (that is, reducing nitrate), but they are different from soil bacteria. The former reduces nitrate to ammonia nitrogen, which is beneficial to crops. The latter reduces nitrate nitrogen to free nitrogen molecules, which results in a large loss of nitrogen in the soil. Strangely, the bacteria on the roots of rice are very different from dry land crops. The bacteria on the roots of rice are mainly aerobic spore-forming bacteria with strong ammoniation ability, and most of them do not have a denitrification effect. This physiological change is of great significance for rice growth. On the one hand, there is very little nitrate nitrogen in the paddy field, and on the other hand, rice mainly absorbs ammonia nitrogen. How to further utilize root bacteria to serve agricultural production remains to be further studied.

In short, soil microorganisms are not a mysterious problem, nor are they a science in an ivory tower. Soil microbiology workers should face agricultural production, so that soil microbiology can serve the greater leap forward in agricultural production in the future. Only in this way can soil microbiology shine.

    土壤微生物学必须为农业生产服务

    土壤微生物的功用
    土壤中的微生物活动是一个复杂的过程，是一个矛盾的统一体。一面是分解，另一面是合成；一面是消耗、另一面是积累。当地球的表面整块的岩石从物理风化、化学风化，到有生物活动起，土壤微生物的分解与合成，消耗与积累的过程，总是向有利于高等植物生长的方向发展。
    首先是土壤中氮素的积累。风化的岩石中即成土母质中并没有氮素。空气中氮素却含有70％。植物虽然生长在空气中，可是它没有能力利用空气中的自由氮分子，它只能利用土壤中的含氮化合物。要使空气中的自由氮分子以化合物的形态固定在土壤中，最主要的必须经过土壤微生物的活动。我们知道，有好多种微生物具有这种固氮的能力，比如自生固氮菌、某些真菌、根瘤菌及其他某些微生物等。经微生物固定的氮素还不能被植物直接利用，必须经过其他种微生物的分解，使有机氮素变成氨态或硝酸态氮的无机物，才能被植物吸收利用。除了氮素之外，土壤微生物的活动，还产生和积累了其他许多植物生活需要而土壤中原来没有的东西，如抗生素、刺激素酶及其他有机物质。土壤腐殖汁中有80％以上的物质都是微生物活动的合成产物。成为土壤母质的化学变化，植物有机体的分解，都不能生成这一类东西。土壤越肥沃，腐殖质积累越多。其次，土壤中团粒结构，微生物起着决定性的作用。成土母质单纯的物理化学变化是不可能构成团粒的。团粒的形成主要在于土壤中的生物化学变化。
    土壤微生物的分解作用并不次于它的合成过程。地球表面每年积存着许许多多的植物落叶残根躯干，动物的尸体等等。这些东西，虽然年复一年地增加，可是它们并没有永远堆积在地球表面，而是不知不觉地“消失”了。这个消失过程，主要是微生物的分解过程。土壤微生物使动植物残体变成有机酸、单醣，直到水、二氧化碳等简单化合物。在炭素的转化过程中，植物借日光的能力将水与二氧化碳合成碳水化合物，而土壤微生物却把它分解成原来的物质，利用其中的热能及炭素。另一方面在氮的转化过程中，土壤微生物源源不断地固定空中的氮素，分解有机物、而释放其中的氮素，使它们变成植物能够利用的物质。除氮、炭的转化之外，有机磷与难溶性无机磷的转化，钾、硫、铁等物质的转化，以及土壤中植物有毒物质的分解，都与土壤微生物的活动有密切的关系。所以研究土壤，不能忽略土壤微生物的活动。这种活动对土壤生成与高等植物生长有决定性的作用。事实上，土壤是陆地疏松肥沃的表层，是人类劳动的产物。地壳表层疏松与否反映着岩石的风化程度如何。土壤是否肥沃，主要在于一系列的生物活动，及物质转化。土壤是否能发挥它的肥力，生长人类生存不可缺少的农作物，完全在于人类的社会劳动。这三个主要的因素关系着土壤的发生、发展、利用和改良。忽略其中任何一点都会使我们走上形而上学的道路。
    把土壤当作风化的产物是错误的
    土壤微生物的功用不是所有的农业科学工作者都承认的。少数人还根据成见，不顾真理，故意否认这种作用。另一些科学工作者又把土壤微生物的作用绝对化、极端化。前者否认土壤微生物在土壤形成过程中的作用，说土壤是岩石风化的产物。在植物的营养方面则认为土壤微生物与植物根系“竞争”养分，否认有机肥料与细菌肥料的作用，片面强调农业化学的作用，把土壤看作一个死的东西；将植物从土壤中吸收养分看作一个简单的物理吸收过程，或者化学变化过程。这种观点在十八世纪前就有了成文的学说，即“归还定律”与“土壤肥力递减律”。根据第一个“定律”，似乎从土壤中，作物“拿走了”什么，便要将什么归还给土壤。虽然这个定律早已受到批判，但是还有少数人非常迷信它，以致讨论生产指标时往往有人首先要计算一下为了达到某个产量指标，作物需要从土壤中拿走多少氮、磷、钾，然后根据这个数字，再计算需要多少肥料。结论是“不行不行！那么多肥料施下去，土壤盐分提高了，植物无法吸收”。也就是说作物的产量是受自然规律限制的，无法再提高。同时这种论调也反映了“土壤肥力递减律”的思想，即根据这个定律，似乎给土壤施肥加工越多，收获反而越少。这个“定律”的科学根据是：“土壤是岩石风化后的产物”，而这个产物经过长期的风雨淋洗日益贫乏，结果是土壤向衰败的方向发展。虽然列宁曾经系统地批判了这种谬论，可是还有少数科学工作者不肯放弃它，只不过从公开的宣扬变成“黑市”推销而已。比如，有人认为深耕主要加速了土壤的风化过程而释放磷钾养料，说深耕不能增加团粒结构，不能增加有机质与氮素。把深耕改土的意义，贬低到只是加速风化过程的机械作用。这是一个不科学的、形而上学的观点。事实上土壤中有机质与氮素的积累，不是一个机械地加多少减多少的问题，而是一系列的生物及其他理化变化过程。深耕与施肥正好是为了加速这个过程，并使它向有利于农作物生长的方向发展。使土壤的肥力日益提高。
    把土壤当作植物的消化系统是武断的
    那些把土壤微生物的功用绝对化、极端化的意见，也不是用科学的态度对待真理的，他们武断地说，土壤微生物是高等植物的消化系统。似乎是凡是植物从土壤中吸收养料，都必须经过土壤微生物的加工。因此有的微生物工作者批评这种“消化系统的理论”时说：“经土壤微生物分解的东西，也不过是有机质或无机盐，而我们所施的肥料中也有无机盐，难道植物在吸取无机盐时就仅仅是选择那印有‘微生物加工’标志的无机盐吗？”（达罗新斯基）这种责难是对的。土壤微生物的作用在高等植物的生活中是巨大的，是有决定性的，可是不是绝对的。
    我们认为前一种把土壤看作风化产物的观点是错误的，是把土壤学倒推到十八世纪以前的基础上来谈科学。后一种把土壤微生物当作植物的“消化系统”的观点是武断的，是将尚未揭开的科学问题作出轻率的总结。
    对土壤微生物功用的不正确认识就会使研究土壤微生物学的工作走入歧途。上面所举的两种观点似乎是冰炭不同炉，可是它们有一个共同点，就是为科学而科学。土壤微生物本来是一门与农业生产有密切联系的科学，却被少数所谓理论家，把它搬上清谈的讲台。土壤微生物工作者热衷于写书，热衷于土壤微生物的分类定名。有的微生物工作者把数年的时间去观察一块不到一分地的土地上，目的是为了找出某些微生物数量变化的曲线，以便写成一篇一鸣惊人的论文。至于这种论文对农业生产有多大价值，研究者本人也不清楚。
    土壤微生物可以改良和利用
    研究土壤微生物学必须与农业生产结合起来。应该研究怎样加强土壤中微生物的活动而促进有机质的分解，保证植物营养的需要，怎样加强土壤中新有机质的合成，怎样增加土壤团粒结构，怎样使土壤肥力日益提高。土壤中除了有益的微生物之外还有许多对作物生长不利的微生物如病原菌等，怎样消灭它们。总之，应该研究改造土壤微生物为农业生产服务。这不是一种空想，而是完全可以办得到的事。我们从北京郊区、天津、东北、南京等地分离了一百多种细菌，然后把它们接种到土壤中去。结果玉米的产量提高了20％以上。在小麦盆栽与单菌的试验中，绝大部分细菌能使小麦幼苗（二十一天）比不接菌的对照增长三分之一到一半。有趣的是接入的细菌在土壤占绝对优势，土壤中原有的细菌数量大大地减少了。这个事实告诉我们：土壤微生物是可以改良的，可以利用的。也就是说我们完全有可能用对作物有益的微生物去代替土壤中原有的微生物。土壤中微生物的种类不是一个自然发展的结果，它是在耕作与作物的影响下不断改变着、发展着的。人们完全有可能掌握这种发展与改变的方向，而利用它为农业生产服务。
    我们初步观察了深耕以后土壤微生物的变化。深耕前土壤微生物的情况是上层多于下层，而且越往下层数量越少。深耕打破了这个“规律”，上下层微生物数量已趋于一致，并且比深耕前增加了数百倍到数千倍。由于微生物的旺盛活动，土壤中可溶性养分显著提高了。比如全氮、全磷由于施肥的关系，深耕地比对照地增加了三倍至四倍。而可溶性氨与磷却增加了六倍至七倍。这是生土熟化的一个具体表现。至于采取怎样的措施进一步利用土壤微生物加速生土熟化，这是一个对农业生产有实际意义的问题。
    除了研究土壤微生物与土壤肥力的关系之外，还必须研究土壤微生物与作物的关系。土壤微生物与作物的种类及生长期有密切的联系。作物旺盛生长的时期，也是土壤微生物活动最强的时候，特别是作物根系周围的微生物，要比其他土壤中多数百倍到数千倍。近年来国外一些科学工作者对农作物根上的微生物作了初步的观察，证明在小麦、玉米、棉花和牧草等旱作物的根上，细菌基本上是一个类型的无芽包杆菌。它们具有很高的反硝化作用（即把硝酸块还原），可是它们与土壤细菌不一样。前者将硝酸块还原到氨态氮，对作物是有益的。而后者却把硝态氮还原到自由氮分子，这样对土壤中的氮素损失很大。奇怪的是水稻的根上细菌与旱作物有很大不同。水稻的根上细菌主要是氨化能力很强的好气性芽包杆菌，绝大部分不具有反硝化作用。这种生理变化对水稻生长有很大意义。一方面是稻田中硝酸态氮非常少，另一方面，水稻主要吸收氨态氮。怎样进一步利用根上细菌为农业生产服务，目前还待进一步研究。
    总之，土壤微生物不是一个神秘的问题，也不是一门象牙塔中的科学。土壤微生物工作者应该面向农业生产，使土壤微生物学能够为今后的农业生产更大跃进服务。也只有这样，土壤微生物学才能放出光芒。
