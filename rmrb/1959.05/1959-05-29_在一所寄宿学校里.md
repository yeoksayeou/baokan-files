    At a Boarding School

    When the First Kiev Boarding School was first established three years ago, the first difficulty encountered was the issue of labor education for the students. Only through common social labor could the more than two hundred students be well united in a friendly big family; however, at that time, most of the students did not have the habit of labor. Some students believed that coming to school was only for studying, and that wiping tables, sweeping the floor, and washing clothes were all done by others, and new clothes would naturally be provided if the old ones were torn.

    Therefore, the Kiev First Boarding School's labor education for students began with self-service in the students' lives. The school stipulated that each student must clean their classroom and dormitory, manage the cafeteria, and wash clothes, with older students responsible for helping younger students. Through these daily labors, the students developed a love for labor, felt proud of their labor achievements, and established a sense of responsibility for the collective cause.

    Now, all the students in this school make their beds neatly every day, keep their rooms clean and tidy, wear clean clothes and shoes, and have learned to sew on buttons, mend clothes, repair shoes, and handle various minor problems in life.

    During the first winter vacation, half of the students stayed at school. The children actively organized various production teams: sewing teams, carpentry teams... The members of the sewing team not only learned to mend clothes and sew shirts using old clothes, but also could sew very beautiful dresses. The young carpenters repaired broken tables and chairs for the school and made wooden frames for the flowerbeds. Every morning, the team leader reported on the team's work, and everyone offered criticism and praise.

    In the village of Gapitonov, twenty kilometers from Kiev, the First Kiev Boarding School has forty-seven hectares of land for orchards. The students themselves grow crops on this land, cultivate fruit trees and flowers, and raise livestock and poultry. In the summer, the students live on this land. In addition to the above-mentioned labor, the students also carried out orchard construction work, and built a power station with their own hands, lighting up the entire orchard.

    Through these labor exercises, excellent qualities such as love of labor and love of the collective have been cultivated in the students. The students' parents expressed their great gratitude for the school's education.

    For example, the mother of Toria, a third-grade student, wrote to the school and said: "Toria's father sacrificed in the war. I come home very late from work every day. I don't have much time to educate my only son. Since Toria came to the First Kiev Boarding School to study, in these three years, I have found how much the child has changed! He is completely different from before. After dinner, Toria rushes to wash the dishes and wipe the table. He makes his bed neatly in the morning, and also mops the floor and takes out the trash. Every Monday morning before returning to school, he washes and irons his clothes, and also knows how to sew. Not only that, my son has become very cultured, polite, and very respectful to the elderly. Cultivating these excellent qualities in the child is beyond my ability. All of this makes me have unspeakable gratitude to the school."

    在一所寄宿学校里
    基辅第一寄宿学校在三年前刚建立起来的时候，首先遇到的困难，就是对学生的劳动教育问题。因为只有通过共同的社会劳动，才能很好地使二百多名学生友好地团结在一个大家庭里；而当时，大部分的学生还没有劳动的习惯。有些学生认为到学校来只是读书，而擦桌、扫地、洗衣都有别人干，衣服破了自然会给新的。
    于是，基辅第一寄宿学校对学生的劳动教育首先从学生的生活自我服务开始。学校规定，每个学生都必须打扫自己的课室和宿舍、管理食堂、洗衣服，高年级的学生负责帮助低年级的学生。通过这些日常劳动，学生们对劳动产生了热爱，为自己的劳动成果感到自豪，而且树立了对集体事业的责任感。
    现在这个学校所有的学生，每天都把床铺得整整齐齐，屋子整理得干干净净，衣服和鞋子穿得很整洁，而且学会了钉纽扣、补衣服、修理鞋子，和处理生活上各种细小的问题。
    在第一个寒假的时候，有半数学生留在学校。孩子们主动组织了各种各样的生产队：缝纫队、木匠队……。缝纫队队员们不仅学会了利用破旧的衣服补衣服，缝衬衣，而且还能缝制很漂亮的连衣裙。年青的木匠们给学校修理了坏桌椅，给花圃作了木架。每天早晨，队长汇报本队工作情况，大家进行批评和表扬。
    在离基辅市二十公里的加皮顿诺夫村里，基辅第一寄宿学校有四十七公顷土地的园地。学生们自己在这块土地上种庄稼，培植果树和花草，饲养牲畜和家禽。夏天，学生们都生活在这块园地上。除了上述的劳动外，学生们还进行了园地修建工作，而且用自己的双手修成了一个发电站，使整个园地点起了电灯。
    通过这些劳动锻炼，在学生们的身上培养起了热爱劳动、热爱集体等优秀品质。学生的家长对学校的教育表示非常感激。
    例如，三年级学生托里亚的母亲写信给学校说：“托里亚的父亲在战争中牺牲了。我每天工作很晚才回家。没有很多时间教育我的独生子。自从托里亚到基辅第一寄宿学校学习以来，这三年间，我发现孩子起了多么大的变化呀！他完全跟过去是两个人了。饭后，托里亚抢着洗碗，擦桌子。早起，他把床铺弄得整整齐齐，还擦地板，倒垃圾。每当星期一早晨回学校以前，他都把衣服洗好熨得平平的，并且还会使针线。这还不算，我的儿子变得很有文化，很懂礼貌，对老人非常尊敬。培养孩子这些优秀品质是我力所不及的。所有这些，使我对学校有说不出的感激。”
