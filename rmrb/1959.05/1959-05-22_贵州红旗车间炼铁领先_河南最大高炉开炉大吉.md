Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, 21st. The iron smelting workshop of the Shuicheng Iron and Steel Plant in Guizhou Province has consistently produced high-quality and high-yield pig iron in the first half of May. The workshop's five small blast furnaces with a total volume of 103 cubic meters have an average daily output of more than 105 tons of pig iron. On the 14th, they even created a new record of 123 tons of pig iron per day. The quality of the iron, after testing, generally has a sulfur content of less than 0.12% and a phosphorus content of less than 0.03%. The average utilization coefficient of the blast furnaces reached 1.26, and the coke ratio also decreased from 1.003 in late April to 0.9856.

In order to strive for high-quality and high-yield pig iron from small blast furnaces, the workers in this workshop have conscientiously implemented the production responsibility system, strictly implemented operating procedures, and regularly maintained and repaired equipment. After the production tasks for May were assigned, the workers took high quality and high yield as the main content of the socialist labor competition. During the competition, the workers widely carried out technical innovations and technical revolutions, aimed at key issues affecting the improvement of pig iron quality and quantity, improved many operating methods and production tools, and pushed pig iron production to a new high.

The iron smelting workshop of the Shuicheng Iron and Steel Plant is currently the best unit in Guizhou Province for producing pig iron. Since this workshop started iron smelting in March 1957, production has been relatively normal. In 1958, the workshop's two blast furnaces, each with a volume of 35 cubic meters and 7.5 cubic meters respectively, produced more than 17,000 tons of qualified pig iron for the country. The average annual utilization coefficient of the blast furnaces reached 1.2825, and the cost and coke ratio were both low. Therefore, it was awarded the honorary title of "Guizhou Province Red Flag Workshop in 1958" by the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry.

Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 21st. The No. 1 blast furnace of the Anyang Iron and Steel Company produced its first batch of iron on the afternoon of the 19th. With the completion and iron production of this blast furnace, the Anyang Iron and Steel Company has initially formed a complete iron and steel enterprise capable of producing iron, steel, and rolled steel.

This blast furnace has a volume of 255 cubic meters and is the largest iron smelting blast furnace in Henan Province. Before the iron was produced, the workers held a grand opening ceremony.

The Anyang Iron and Steel Company is the largest iron and steel complex being built in Henan Province. At present, the company is simultaneously focusing on both capital construction and production. They have decided that by the end of this year, in addition to basically completing the company's capital construction tasks, they will also produce 150,000 tons of pig iron, 50,000 tons of steel ingots, and 30,000 tons of steel for the country.

    贵州红旗车间炼铁领先  河南最大高炉开炉大吉
    新华社贵阳21日电　贵州省水城钢铁厂炼铁车间，在5月上半月生产的生铁，一直是质量好、产量高。全车间五座总容积一百零三立方公尺的小高炉，平均日产生铁一百零五吨多，14日还创造了日产生铁一百二十三吨的新纪录；铁的质量经过化验，一般含硫量均在0.12％以下，含磷在0.03％以下。高炉平均利用系数达到一点二六，焦比也由4月下旬的一点○○三下降到○点九八五六。
    这个车间的职工为了争取小高炉生铁优质高产，认真推行了生产责任制，严格贯彻了操作规程，并且定期维护修理设备。在5月份的生产任务下达以后，职工们以优质高产作为社会主义劳动竞赛的主要内容。在竞赛中，职工们针对影响提高生铁质量和数量的关键问题，广泛开展了技术革新和技术革命，改进了不少操作方法和生产工具，把生铁生产推向新的高潮。
    水城钢铁厂炼铁车间，是贵州省目前生产生铁最好的一个单位。这个车间从1957年3月开始炼铁以来，生产一直比较正常。1958年这个车间的两座各为三十五立方公尺和七点五立方公尺的高炉，曾为国家生产了一万七千多吨合格生铁，高炉全年平均利用系数达到一点二八二五，成本和焦比都较低，因此获得了冶金工业部命名的“1958年贵州省红旗车间”的光荣称号。
    新华社郑州21日电安阳钢铁公司一号高炉，19日下午炼出了第一炉铁。由于这座高炉建成出铁，安阳钢铁公司已经初步形成了能够出铁、出钢和轧制钢材的完整的钢铁企业。
    这座高炉容积为二百五十五立方公尺，是河南省最大的一座炼铁高炉。出铁前，职工们举行了隆重的开炉典礼。
    安阳钢铁公司是河南省正在建设的最大的钢铁联合企业。目前，这个公司正在一手抓基建，一手抓生产。他们决定，到今年年底除了基本上完成全公司的基建任务外，还要为国家生产生铁十五万吨、钢锭五万吨、钢材三万吨。
