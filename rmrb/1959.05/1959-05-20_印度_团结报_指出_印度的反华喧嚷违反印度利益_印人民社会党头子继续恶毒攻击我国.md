Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, May 19th. The "Unity Newspaper" published a commentary today pointing out that the anti-China movement stirred up in India after the Tibetan upper-class reactionary group launched a rebellion "definitely violates India's interests."

The newspaper pointed out that the "uproar" stirred up in India over the Tibetan rebellion was deliberately manufactured. It said that "some people make inflammatory speeches against China, write fierce articles, and make hate-filled remarks. They do not do this for India, nor for Tibet."

The newspaper said, "The Tibetan dispute actually arose from a rebellion organized to oppose the Chinese authorities. This rebellion was launched by the big landlords who controlled the large monasteries in the name of religion." The newspaper pointed out that the Tibetan upper-class reactionary group launched a rebellion in an "attempt to separate Tibet from China."

Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, May 19th. According to a report in the "Indian Express" on the 18th, J.B. Kripalani, the head of the Indian People's Socialist Party, who is particularly fanatical in attacking China by taking advantage of the Tibetan rebellion, once again made absurd remarks at a press conference held in Madras, saying, "The crux of the Tibetan problem is that Tibet is a buffer state between India and China, and we should not have allowed Tibet's independence to be undermined without objection."

Kripalani talked nonsense, saying, "We should not have recognized China's 'aggression' against Tibet." He repeatedly reiterated the fallacy that Tibet is a "buffer state" between India and China, and even nonsensically claimed that for India's "security," Tibet's status as a "buffer" must be maintained.

He also said, "If the Chinese want to gain the friendship of the Indian people, then they should not have started a wild and vicious anti-Indian propaganda campaign first."

Kripalani falsely accused that "the Chinese have failed the friendship of the Indian people."

Kripalani once again exposed his ugly face by saying: "Their (China's) actions in Tibet not only hurt the feelings of the people of Southeast Asia, but also made the people of Southeast Asia increasingly turn to the United States." It was previously reported that Kripalani, while using the Tibetan rebellion to attack China, had constantly incited Asian countries to throw themselves into the arms of the United States.

Kripalani does not conceal his consistent opposition to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. When he cited the fallacies he had made on various occasions in recent years regarding the Tibetan issue, he said:
  "Panchsheel was born in sin, and was announced on the eve of a nation losing its freedom."

Kripalani, who has deep feelings for the Tibetan rebels, went to Madras to organize a so-called "Relief Committee for Tibetan Refugees." This "committee" will be affiliated with the so-called "Central Relief Committee for Tibetans" established in Delhi in mid-April. In addition, it was also decided to establish larger "committees" of this nature in major cities such as Bombay and Calcutta.

### 印度“团结报”指出  印度的反华喧嚷违反印度利益  印人民社会党头子继续恶毒攻击我国

    印度“团结报”指出
    印度的反华喧嚷违反印度利益
    印人民社会党头子继续恶毒攻击我国
    新华社新德里19日电　“团结报”今天发表评论指出，西藏上层反动集团发动叛乱后在印度掀起的攻击中国的运动，“肯定是违反印度的利益的”。
    这家报纸指出，在印度就西藏叛乱事件掀起的“喧嚣”是有意制造出来的。它说“有些人发表反对中国的煽动性的演说，撰写激烈的文章，发表充满仇恨的谈话，他们这样做并不是为了印度，也不是为了西藏。”
    这家报纸说，“西藏争端实际上是由于为反对中国当局而组织的叛乱引起的。这种叛乱是由控制着大寺院的大地主以宗教为名发动的。”报纸指出，西藏上层反动集团发动叛乱，是“企图使西藏从中国分裂出去”。
    新华社新德里19日电　据“印度快报”18日消息，利用西藏叛乱事件攻击中国特别疯狂的印度人民社会党头子克里帕拉尼在马德拉斯举行的记者招待会上又发表谬论说，“西藏问题的症结在于：西藏是印度和中国之间的一个缓冲国，我们本来就不应该毫无异议地让西藏独立遭到破坏。”
    克里帕拉尼信口雌黄地说，“我们本来就不应该承认中国对西藏的‘侵略’”。他一再重复西藏是印度和中国之间的一个“缓冲国”的谰言，还胡说什么为了印度的“安全”，西藏作为“缓冲”的地位原是必须加以保持的。
    他还说，“如果中国人要得到印度人民的友谊，那么他们原不应该先开始进行狂野的、恶毒的反对印度人的宣传。”
    克里帕拉尼反诬“中国人已经辜负了印度人民的友谊”。
    克里帕拉尼再次暴露他的丑恶面目说：“他们（中国）在西藏所采取的行动，不仅伤害了东南亚人民的感情，而且还使东南亚人民愈来愈转向美国。”前已报道，克里帕拉尼在借西藏叛乱事件攻击中国的同时，曾经不断鼓动亚洲国家投入美国的怀抱。
    克里帕拉尼并不掩盖他一贯采取的反对和平共处五项原则的态度，他援引他近年来在各种场合所发表的有关西藏问题的谬论时说：
  “潘查希拉是在罪恶中诞生的，是在一个民族丧失它的自由的前夕宣布的。”
    对西藏叛匪怀着浓厚感情的克里帕拉尼到马德拉斯去是为了在那里组织所谓“救济西藏难民委员会”。这个“委员会”将附属于4月
  中旬在德里成立的所谓“中央救济西藏人委员会”。另外，还决定在孟买、加尔各答等大城市成立规模更大的这种性质的“委员会”。
