    Ten Thousand People Flock to See the China Pavilion
    ——A Record of the China Pavilion Exhibition at the Casablanca International Fair
    Wang Wei
    The beautiful city of Casablanca, world-renowned during the Second World War, has taken on an extraordinary atmosphere these past few days. Facing the vast Atlantic Ocean, the International Fair is bustling with traffic. Upon entering the venue, people are immediately drawn to the majestic and grand Soviet and Chinese pavilions, situated on the left and right of the fair's entrance. Whether they are seasoned fair attendees or first-time visitors, they are captivated by these two pavilions.
    Millions of Moroccan people and guests from afar are visiting the China Pavilion with joy and admiration, many lingering until closing time, reluctant to leave. At the fair, the people of China and Morocco, separated by thousands of miles, are connected by their finest offerings and sincerest friendship.
    Although this is China's third time participating in the Casablanca International Fair, this year's exhibition is not only twice the scale of last year's, but it also coincides with the establishment of diplomatic relations and the signing of the first trade agreement between China and Morocco, making the Moroccan people even more eager to understand People's China than before. Moroccan Prime Minister Ibrahim told the Chinese Ambassador that trade between China and Morocco has already begun, and China's participation in the fair will allow the Moroccan people to see Chinese products and further understand China.
    On the opening day, the King of Morocco, after visiting the exhibitions of twenty-one countries, unusually began his tour with the Soviet Pavilion and then immediately proceeded to the China Pavilion. The King frequently paused to carefully observe and inquire about many exhibits.
    Even before the official opening of the fair, many Moroccan visitors were continuously streaming into the China Pavilion.
    Like the Chinese people, the Moroccan people have a great fondness for tea. Chinese green tea has been introduced to Morocco since an unknown era, becoming an indispensable beverage in the daily lives of the Moroccan people. After visiting the China Pavilion, the Governor of Casablanca Province, Bagchi, inquired in detail about the production of Chinese tea. The head of the Chinese exhibition group said that the climate and geographical conditions of Morocco are also suitable for tea cultivation, and China hopes to see Morocco develop its own tea industry. Bagchi was somewhat surprised and said, "Wouldn't this make China and Morocco competitors in tea exports?" The head of the Chinese exhibition group explained that China has a vast domestic market and does not need to participate in international market competition, and that China's foreign trade is based on the principle of friendship and mutual benefit. Bagchi expressed his satisfaction and gratitude for China's friendly wish for Morocco to develop its own national economy.
    This time, the China Pavilion is exhibiting not only Chinese silks, carpets, teas, and various exquisite handicrafts that have been praised by the Moroccan people and other foreign guests, but also various machine tools, lathes, precision instruments, and steel products. This is a sign that China is moving towards industrialization, especially demonstrating the achievements of the Great Leap Forward since 1958. The Moroccan people are happy for China's achievements. "Cheers to the Chinese people for defeating capitalism! The Chinese people inspire the world with their example!" wrote one visitor in the guestbook. A visitor named Abderrahman wrote in the guestbook: "We are amazed by the progress made by the friendly Chinese people in such a short period!" Every day, many visitors write enthusiastic phrases in Arabic, French, English, and Spanish in the guestbook, expressing their love and sympathy for the Chinese people. A Moroccan worker looked at the weaving machine exhibited in the China Pavilion, reluctant to leave for a long time. Finally, he asked to stay and operate the machine with the Chinese workers to demonstrate its use.
    Whether it was the veiled Moroccan women taking away a strand of yarn from the textile machine, or the audience around the printing press receiving a beautifully printed picture, all revealed infinite joy and friendly feelings towards the Chinese people.
    Those farmers from the four corners of Morocco, the Berber farmers in white robes, the farmers in Rif clothing, they had so much interest in Chinese agricultural products! They looked and looked again at the agricultural exhibits, tasted and tasted again. Some farmers asked to take a little of each agricultural product on display back with them so that their neighbors who did not have the opportunity to see the China Pavilion could see them.
  Among the tens of thousands of visitors, enthusiastic Algerians could be seen everywhere, leaving many warm words expressing their deep friendship for the Chinese people: "We congratulate the Chinese people for constantly striking blows against Western colonialism. Let us bless the Chinese people!"
  "We support the Chinese people, and we thank them for the friendship work they are doing and for their help to our Algerian brothers." Many Algerian friends saw that the China Pavilion displayed Chairman Mao's works, and they repeatedly hoped to obtain these works, especially hoping to obtain a translation of "Strategic Problems of China's Revolutionary War."
    Almost everything in the China Pavilion, whether it was carpets, silks, radios, or machine tools, medical equipment, or electron tubes, there were always people asking if they were for sale. Some visitors asked to have the first right to purchase their favorite products when they were sold. The kiosk in the China Pavilion was surrounded by layers of people every day, buying Chinese green tea, canned food, embroidery, toys, textiles, cotton cloth, and many other exquisite handicrafts.
    The Moroccan people are very concerned about the implementation of the Sino-Moroccan trade agreement and the prospects for Sino-Moroccan trade. Some Moroccan visitors said that they can now buy Chinese products at the exhibition hall, but after the exhibition closes, where can they buy Chinese products? This shows how much the Moroccan people long to further develop friendly trade relations between China and Morocco.
    What is it that makes the Moroccan people so fond of the China Pavilion? The Moroccan newspaper "Al-Ittihad" commented: "The China Pavilion not only attracts a large audience with its industrial products, but also exhibits agricultural products that occupy an important position in the world, especially the unparalleled Chinese tea presented to the audience. Chinese textiles and handicrafts inherit the excellent traditions of China for thousands of years; if these things disappear from life, it will be an irreparable loss to the whole world. How can women not be fascinated by those gorgeous silks, embroideries, especially those fragrant and colorful floral fabrics and those attractive Chinese carpets with national colors. Chinese workers have an almost genius-like unparalleled talent, and they create ingenious things from stones, wood, ivory, and various materials. The achievements they have made are simply a miracle. The leaders of this country pay great attention to preserving this very precious wealth.
    "The revolution that China is now carrying out is making China one of the most modern and powerful countries in the world. The efforts made by the Chinese people to give China its due place in the ranks of industrial countries will arouse deep sympathy. It should be believed that China's deeply rooted attraction will inevitably create an irresistible sympathy for the Chinese working people. Everyone understands that strengthening close economic ties must expand trade relations between the two countries. Morocco will certainly have great interest in such a vast market as China, so China's participation in the Casablanca International Fair has special significance." (Attached pictures)
    The 15th Casablanca International Fair opened in Casablanca, Morocco's largest port, on April 24 and closed on May 10. Twenty-one countries participated in the fair, with more than 500,000 visitors. The Chinese Exhibition Hall exhibited more than 4,000 exhibits.

    万人争看中国馆
    ——记卡萨布兰卡国际博览会中国馆的展出
    王纬
    在第二次世界大战期间闻名于世的美丽的卡萨布兰卡，这几天增添了一番不寻常的气氛。面临着碧波万顷的大西洋，国际博览会门前一片车水马龙。人们一踏进会场，首先就望见庄严宏伟的苏联展览馆和中国展览馆，它们正当博览会进口处的一左一右，无论是年年参加博览会的观众还是第一次来到这里的人，都被它们所吸引。
    千万摩洛哥人民和其它国家远道来的客人，都带着欣喜赞赏的心情来到中国馆，许多人直到深夜闭馆的时候还眷恋地舍不得离去。在博览会上，相隔万里的中、摩两国人民用自己最美好的东西和最真诚的友谊联系起来了。
    虽然中国已经是第三次参加卡萨布兰卡国际博览会，但今年中国馆的展出，不仅规模比去年大一倍，而且是正当中摩两国建立了外交关系，签订了第一个贸易协定，摩洛哥人民比过去更加热切地希望了解人民中国的时候。摩洛哥首相易卜拉欣对中国大使说，中摩两国的贸易已经开展，这次中国参加博览会，又可以使摩洛哥人民看到中国的产品，进一步了解中国。
    开幕那天，摩洛哥国王在参观二十一个国家的展出中，首先参观了苏联馆，然后就立刻绕道来到中国馆，这是不寻常的。国王在许多展品面前时时停下来仔细观看和询问。
    在博览会正式开幕之前，许多摩洛哥观众就络绎不绝地到中国馆来参观。
    摩洛哥人民和中国人民一样，非常喜欢饮茶，不知道从什么年代开始中国的绿茶就传到了摩洛哥，成为摩洛哥人民日常生活中不可缺少的饮料。卡萨布兰卡省长巴格契在参观中国馆之后，详细地询问了中国茶叶生产的情况，中国展览团团长说，摩洛哥的气候和地理条件也适于植茶的，中国希望看见摩洛哥发展自己的茶业。巴格契听了之后有点惊异的说，这样一来，摩中两国在茶叶出口上岂不成了竞争的对象了吗？当中国展览团团长说明中国有着广大的国内市场，无需参加国际市场上的竞争，中国的对外贸易是建立在友好互利的原则上的。巴格契满意地表示非常感谢中国希望摩洛哥发展自己民族经济的友好愿望。
    这次中国馆展出的，不仅有着受到摩洛哥人民和其它外国客人赞口不绝的中国丝绸、地毯、茶叶以及种种精美的手工艺品，而且还展出了各种工作母机、车床、精密仪器以及钢产品。这是中国正在走向工业化的标志，尤其是表现了1958年以来大跃进的成果。摩洛哥人民都为中国的成就而高兴。“为中国人民战胜资本主义而欢呼，中国人民以自己的榜样来感动世界人民”，这是留言簿上一个观众的题辞。一个叫阿布德·拉哈曼的观众在留言簿上写道：“我们对友爱的中国人民在短期内所获得的进展感到惊奇！”每天都有许多参观者一个紧接一个地在留言簿上用阿拉伯文、法文、英文、西班牙文写下热情的辞句，表达他们对中国人民的热爱与同情。一个摩洛哥工人看了中国馆展出的织布机，久久舍不得离开，最后他要求留下来和中国工人一起在这部机器上操作表演。
    无论是那些戴着面纱的摩洛哥妇女，从纺织机上带走一根细纱；或是围绕在印刷机旁的观众得到一张刚刚印刷出来的精美的图片，都流露出无限的喜悦和对中国人民友好的感情。
    那些来自摩洛哥四乡的，穿着白色长袍的柏伯尔族的农民，穿着里夫族服装的农民，他们对中国农产品有着多么大的兴趣呵。他们在农业展览品面前看了再看，尝了又尝。有的农民要求把展出的每种农产品带点回去，以便给那些没有机会看见中国馆的乡邻看看。
  在成千上万的观众中，到处可以遇见热情洋溢的阿尔及利亚人，他们留下许多热情的话，表达了对中国人民深厚的友情：“我们祝贺中国人民不断给西方殖民主义者以打击，让我们为中国人民祝福吧！”
  “我们支持中国人民，我们感谢它所进行的友谊的工作，以及对我们阿尔及利亚兄弟的帮助。”许多阿尔及利亚朋友看见中国馆陈列有毛主席的著作，他们一再希望能够得到这些作品，特别希望得到“中国革命战争的战略问题”的译本。
    几乎中国馆的一切展品，无论是地毯、丝绸、收音机，还是机床、医疗器械、电子管，总是不断有人来打听是否出售。有些观众对他们喜爱的产品，要求在出售时得到第一个购买的权利。中国馆的小卖亭每天围着一层又一层的人，他们从那里买到中国的绿茶、罐头、刺绣、玩具、纺织品、棉布以及许许多多精美的手工艺品。
    摩洛哥人民非常关心中摩贸易协定执行的情况，关心中摩贸易的前景。一些摩洛哥观众说，现在可以在展览馆买到中国的东西，展览会闭幕之后，从什么地方能够买到中国的东西呢。这表明摩洛哥人民多么渴望进一步开展中摩两国友好的贸易关系。
    是什么东西使得摩洛哥人民如此热爱中国馆呢？摩洛哥的“团结报”评论说：“中国馆不仅工业产品吸引着广大的观众，同时还展出了在世界上占有重要地位的农产品，特别是无与伦比的中国茶叶呈现在观众面前。中国的纺织品与手工艺品继承了中国几千年来优秀的传统；这些东西如果一旦从生活中消失了，对全世界来说，这将是无可弥补的损失。妇女们怎能不迷恋于那些绚烂辉煌的丝绸、刺绣，尤其是那些芬芳艳丽的香花布和那么富于吸引力的、有着民族色采的中国地毯。中国工人有着近乎天才的无可比拟的才能，他们在石块、木头、象牙和种种材料上制造出巧夺天工的东西来。他们所达到的成就简直是一种奇迹。这个国家的领导人十分注意保持这部分非常宝贵的财富。
    “现在中国所进行的革命正在使得中国成为世界上最现代化的强国之一。中国人民为使得中国在工业国的行列中得到它应有的地位所作的努力，将会引起深刻的同情。应当相信，中国深入人心的吸引力，一定会造成不可抗拒的人们对中国劳动人民的同情。每个人都了解，加强密切的经济联系，必须扩大两国间的贸易关系。摩洛哥对于中国这样一个广阔的市场，一定会有很大的兴趣，因此，中国参加卡萨布兰卡国际博览会具有特殊的意义”。（附图片）
    第十五届卡萨布兰卡国际博览会4月24日在摩洛哥最大的港口卡萨布兰卡开幕，于5月10日闭幕。参加博览会的有二十一个国家，观众在五十万人以上。中国展览馆共展出了四千多件展览品。
