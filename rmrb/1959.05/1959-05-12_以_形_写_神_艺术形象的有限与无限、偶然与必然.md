Using "Form" to Convey "Spirit"
    -- The Finite and Infinite, Accidental and Inevitable Nature of Artistic Images
    Li Zehou
    After reading Comrade Wang Chaowen's article "One as Ten" (People's Daily, March 10), it brought to mind some interesting questions. For example, the questions of the finite and infinite, the accidental and inevitable in art. Successful works of art are always able to convey a necessary, infinitely broad content through some accidental, finite, and concrete images to touch and move people, and that is why they are "one as ten." I remember when I was a child, when I looked at Qi Baishi's paintings, all I saw were a few shrimp, and they were neither as fun as the shrimp in the pond, nor as meticulously and conscientiously drawn as those in the school posters, which I admired... But later, when I was older and looked at them again, it was different: I saw not only the shrimp on the picture, but also felt a kind of intimate and cheerful, invigorating emotion, a youthful, spring-like affirmation and joy of life. Then, I was completely convinced: this is true art: painting shrimp is not just about shrimp... it contains more, broader, and richer things, even though they are not directly painted or labeled on the picture. This made me think that the so-called "meaning beyond the image," "sound beyond the string," "meaning beyond words" that the Chinese art tradition emphasizes so much is probably what this is about. "Image," "string," and "word" are concrete, finite images, they are just "one"; but these "one" should break through or transcend the superficial limited meaning of their own images (hence "beyond"), and summarize and concentrate the richer and more profound "meaning," "sound," and "intention" – "ten," "hundred," "thousand" – of life and the people's thoughts and feelings. Reflecting "spirit." The image of a few shrimp is extremely limited, but the healthy flavor and spirit of life it reflects is vast and boundless. I remember an interesting article by a Soviet psychologist discussing the use of painting to test children. It said that many children explain and interpret their paintings with language, and the content of their explanations is always more than the things visible in the picture (for example, "The trees have no leaves, it's snowing, winter is coming"). Other children cannot; they can only point to the things in the painting and say: this is what, that is what (e.g., "This is a tree," "This is snow," "This is the sun")... This psychological research report is of course not related to the art we are talking about, but it made me feel that the paintings of the first group of children are somewhat in line with the laws of art: "meaning beyond the image," although this "meaning" is very simple and superficial, the "image" of "snowing, trees without leaves" does express or demand the expression of a "winter is coming" "meaning." The latter is not like that, the "image" is just "image": snowing is snowing, the sun is shining is the sun shining... Of course, the creation of artists and this kind of children's painting have great, even fundamental, differences in nature. For example, for children, whether there is "meaning" or not may mainly lie in whether there is a requirement to express "meaning." For artists, the question is often not whether there is, but whether it can be realized. Art always extracts images from life, and images are always finite and accidental. Moreover, images in life do not all have equal value: some life images themselves have greater content or meaning; relatively speaking, more "infinite" is contained in those "finite," and more "inevitable" is embodied in "accidental"; while other life images are relatively narrow "finite" and "accidental," often "one" is just "one," and "form" is just "form." Some are even purely false images. But no matter what kind of life phenomenon, if the artist does not add a layer of "from the surface to the inside," "removing the crude and retaining the refined" effort to it, then it will often be trapped in the limited "image," "string," "word" to a greater or lesser extent, and cannot convey more "meaning," "sound," "intention," trapped in "form," unable to convey "spirit." For example, some of our works today write about steelmaking just as steelmaking, paint about fertilizer accumulation just as fertilizer accumulation,... one cannot see or feel that there can be more abundant things beyond the image on the screen. In fact, writing about steelmaking does not necessarily mean writing and performing all the details of the steelmaking process in life, such as meetings, debates, etc., even though these may be true and accurate life phenomena, but if only the surface is made into an article, then even if the image is simulated vividly and exaggerated to the extreme, in the end, I am afraid that it still cannot escape the limited content and meaning of the surface image, and still cannot highly summarize and reflect the essence of the broad era life, and can only be lower than life. Comrade Guo Moruo said it well: "Daily life is not equal to art. If the drama is just a few slices of daily life, then everywhere is a stage, and it's free. Why should the audience pay to buy tickets to your theater to watch a drama!" ("Drama News," 1959, Issue 5).
    Therefore, I think that any scene, subject matter, plot, character... are just concrete finite images. The key lies in how to treat it and deal with it: is it to be imprisoned forever in the "this is what, that is what" "form," or to make it break out of this limitation so that the "form" contains more things. "This is a tree," "This is snow," "This is steelmaking, fertilizer accumulation" is "form," Qi Baishi's shrimp, Lu Xun's Ah Q, and Chairman Mao's "The bleak autumn wind blows again, but the world has changed" are also "form." But how different are these two kinds of "form": one is a truly limited, isolated, and all-encompassing "form," and the other is a "form" that sees the infinite in the finite, has profound meaning, and never gets tired of reading. Artists should try their best to strive for the latter and avoid the former. Many ancient Chinese artists understood this. Therefore, they always emphasized breaking through "formal resemblance" to achieve "spiritual resemblance," emphasizing "using form to convey spirit," and "combining form and spirit." Long and rich artistic practice has made them understand that artistic images are always finite and concrete: even if the scene is spread out as long as the "Three Capitals Rhapsody," it cannot write about all the life phenomena; even if the flowers are depicted as fine as meticulous paintings, they are still not as good as natural objects themselves. Therefore, to break through the limitation of images, one cannot only focus on the superficial external form copying or scene exaggeration - making a fuss on "formal resemblance," but should try to give the image depth, and try to refine the image so that it can reflect and express the rich life truth to the greatest extent. That is, to use "form" to convey "spirit." Only by "using form to convey spirit" can one "one as ten." Chinese traditional art has surprisingly possessed this ability, and it has accumulated and created extremely excellent methods of typification: good at expressing a lot of things with very few things, and reflecting very broad content with very limited images. Whether it is Chinese painting, opera, novels, or poetry, this is always the case. A short vaudeville can "observe the moment of ancient and modern, and caress the four seas in an instant"; a small landscape painting can go up and down thousands of fathoms, and traverse tens of thousands of miles; novels are highly generalized outlines of rough lines; poetry emphasizes "the blending of emotion and scenery," and "meaning in scenery," never writing scenery for the sake of writing scenery. They all, without exception, pay special attention to "cherishing ink like gold," "pondering every word," and on the other hand, they also pay special attention to "one singing and three sighs," and "words have an end but meaning is endless." Precisely because the infinity and breadth of artistic content is more emphasized ("meaning is endless"), the finiteness of artistic images is more cherished ("words have an end"), the more strict the requirement that the limited artistic image can contain broad and rich content, and thus the more cherish ink like gold, ponder every word, temper thousands of times, strive for perfection, and strive to make every word, every stroke, every chapter, every action, are not wasted. Cai Kuanfu's poetry said: "Although the language created by poets in the Jin and Song Dynasties is beautiful, most of the upper and lower sentences have the same meaning, such as... 'Cicadas chirp, the forest is quieter, birds sing, the mountain is more secluded,' it is not without skill, but it cannot avoid this disease in the end." Later poets also have the so-called taboo of "clapping palms" (upper and lower symmetry with the same meaning). These art appreciation and commentaries are so harsh and so meticulous in discussing these principles precisely because they understand that the image is finite. Only when "spirit" is seen in "form," and "form" is used to convey "spirit" can it become beautiful (this is one of the main spirits of our national aesthetics), therefore the image should be highly refined and concentrated, and any redundancy or repetition is contrary to this... Today we can critically understand and learn these principles, and we must cherish our every word, every detail, every stroke, every shot, every line... we must make full use of the finite image of art! Dig it and dig it, refine it and refine it, like Lu Xun's novels, like Chairman Mao's poems. Make every chapter, every word, can convey the extremely rich life content with extremely limited images. In this "form" see "spirit", in "one" see "ten", see "hundreds", "thousands", so that it will not make people "see all at a glance", but it is truly "never tire of reading".
    The accidental and inevitable connected to this are also the same principle. The finite concrete image of art is always accidental, but the broad and profound content reflected and expressed through it must always be inevitable. Life phenomena themselves have an extremely rich and complex diversity of chance. The same bad people can still be very different. The same good people are also the same. Revolutionaries who grew up in the same environment can be lively, witty, and cheerful Ouyang Li'an, or they can be silent and prudent Ouyang Yingjian. This accidental personality difference in life does not hinder, but rather highlights the distinct characteristics of each of them as revolutionaries as a necessity. Commonality exists through individuality, and the general through the individual; the same is true of the inevitable and the accidental. This is how it is in life, and it should be even more so in art that reflects life with images. Only in this way can "form" convey "spirit," and "one" can be "ten," and artistic types have meaning.
    The same "Qin Xianglian" can be written as "Beheading the Consort" - borrowing the power of Bao Gong to avenge her hatred, or it can be written as "Aesthetic Consort" - using her own hands to take revenge; the same "Zhaojun's Departure from the Frontier," Royal Brother Wang Long can be a vulgar clown in Peking Opera, or a good person with deep affection in Hunan local opera. "Beheading the Consort" or "Aesthetic Consort" are both possible, art can reflect and describe from the various different sides of the ever-changing, complex and diverse nature of life phenomena, but these reflections and descriptions must be able to reflect and express the necessity required by life and people's thoughts and feelings. Therefore, the question is not whether there can be chance in art, but whether and how this chance can express necessity, whether and how this accidental "form" can express the necessary "spirit"... The image of the madman in "A Madman's Diary" is probably the least common and most unusual "accidental," but Lu Xun can still express and reflect a necessity of social life content that is so profoundly true from this chance. One madman in "A Madman's Diary" represents hundreds of millions of oppressed and persecuted people under the feudal system. The more crazy the madman, the more misunderstandings and fears of his brother eating his flesh, the more accidental, the more it exposes the cannibalistic nature of etiquette, the more inevitable. Just like the finite and the infinite, here, the accidental and the inevitable are dialectically contradictory and unified. Chinese art, whether it is novels, operas, poems, lyrics, paintings, also understands this principle especially well. Therefore, on the one hand, they emphasize "no coincidence, no story," "nothing is not based on the square to borrow the coincidence, and the situation will be strange," the story and drama are extremely strong and compact; on the other hand, it is also so clever and reasonable, so clever that there is no trace, as if it is inevitable, so it is completely convincing. "Poetry should be simple, not clever, but it must be the simplicity of great skill" ("Suiyuan Poetry Talk"). Delicate and far-fetched, "the drama is not enough, God comes to make up"... has always been considered a failure. Because this kind of chance has no inevitable content. Similarly, if the ending of "Qin Xianglian" is not "trial" or "beheading" but a happy reunion, it will not work; conversely, if "The Decree of Life and Death" is not a happy reunion but ends with He General's arrogance, it will not work either. The audience will not agree. Although this kind of chance can exist in life, art must abandon it. Because this kind of chance does not have inevitable content, it cannot reflect the chance of social development that is universally large or will be universally large in life, it is a purely accidental "form" that cannot convey "spirit." Therefore, the so-called "poetry is more real than history," and "the truth of art is different from the superficial truth of life" means that the chance selected and concentrated by art is more necessary than the chance that appears in history and life; it can better reflect the essential truth of life; it is more clever, and more true; it is one, but more than ten; the stronger the story, the higher the truth must be. The day "Xue Baochai leaves the boudoir to become a great gift" is also the time when "Lin Daiyu burns her manuscript to break her infatuation," is it not coincidental? It is a coincidence. Is it not true? Very true. The strong dramatic artistic contrast strengthens the expression of the theme thought and makes people feel the inevitable power of this tragedy. Cao Cao can be said to be an outstanding historical figure, and there can and should be plays that overturn the case. However, the image of Cao Cao, the traitor, who has been circulating on the stage and in novels for a long time, is still a kind of chance with inevitable content: the treachery, insidiousness, and viciousness concentrated in Cao Cao (this is chance. Because there have been many rulers in history who are worse in quality than Cao Cao. But please note that "chance" does not mean that there is no reason, Cao Cao being portrayed as a bad person is related to the fact that some of his qualities and means are indeed insidious and vicious, thus being hated by the people) is the typical portrayal of the ruling class by the people (this is inevitable). The "chance" concentrated on one image of Cao Cao is precisely the "necessity" of thousands of feudal rulers. In this sense, poetry is more real than history.
    A deep understanding and mastery of the finite and infinite, the accidental and inevitable in art is of great significance to creating a garden of art images that are colorful, diverse, and original today. Ignoring the finite and accidental nature of art can easily lead to the loss of the diverse, rich, and complex images of life itself, and allowing the inevitable and infinite to appear in a naked posture. The conservative engineers in dramas must wear glasses, wear suits, and argue with workers... This is often the reason why the infinite and inevitable are expressed only from a logical concept: conservative engineers often have bourgeois thoughts and even lifestyle habits, which is indeed an undoubtedly infinite necessity in life. However, they appear naked, without the very concrete finite and accidental that life itself possesses and that art should concentrate and highlight to express, what the audience gets is only some logical concepts, and the play is not "durable to watch." Marxism emphasizes the tendency of art, but also points out that this tendency "should not be said specifically, but should let it flow out from the scenes and plots themselves" (Engels's letter to Minna Kautsky). A foreign aesthetician once said that aesthetic feeling must be the harmonious and free movement of imagination and reason. Whether it is the limited nature of naturalist images or the naked necessity of logic, neither can give people room to play their imagination, to linger and repeatedly savor their "meaning beyond the image" and "sound beyond the string," leaving only the bare rational understanding: "This is what, that is what," then of course it is not "durable to watch."
    Therefore, if there is only the finite and accidental in art, it is often naturalism or formalism; if there is only the infinite and inevitable, it is easy to become dogmatism and logical thesis, neither of which is beautiful. Beauty, as Chernyshevsky said, is something that encompasses everything and is ever-changing. Encompassing everything is its infinitely rich and necessary life content, while ever-changing is precisely its diverse accidental and limited artistic form. To encompass everything and be ever-changing, it is necessary to combine form and spirit, "one" as "ten," and use "form" to convey "spirit."

### 以“形”写“神”——艺术形象的有限与无限、偶然与必然

    以“形”写“神”
    ——艺术形象的有限与无限、偶然与必然
    李泽厚
    读了王朝闻同志的文章“一以当十”（人民日报3月10日）后，令人想起一些有趣的问题。例如，艺术中的有限与无限、偶然与必然的问题。成功的艺术作品，总能够在一些偶然的有限的具体形象里传达出那必然的无限广阔的内容来打动人和感动人，所以才“一以当十”。记得小时候看齐白石的画，看来看去也只是几只虾米，并且既不如池塘里的虾米那样好玩，也不如学校挂图上的那样仔细认真令我佩服……。但后来，年纪大些时再去看，却不同了：看到的不仅是画面上的虾子，而且还感到一种那么亲切开朗令人想活动起来的愉快情绪，一种年青的春天般的对生活的肯定和喜悦。于是，我完全折服了：这是真正的艺术：画虾子不仅仅是虾子……，其中包含着更多的、更广阔、更丰富的东西，尽管画面上并没把它直接画出或注明。因此这使我想到，中国艺术传统那么讲究那么强调的所谓“象外之旨”“弦外之音”“言外之意”，大概也就是就这个道理说的。“象”“弦”“言”是些具体的有限形象，它们只是些“一”；但这些“一”应该突破或超越自己形象本身的表面有限意义（所以说是“外”），而概括集中地反映出生活和人民思想感情的更丰富深远的“旨”“音”“意”——“十”“百”“千”。反映出“神”。几只虾子的形象是极有限的，但它所反映出来的健康生活的韵味和风神却是极广阔无垠的。记得一篇苏联心理学家谈用绘画测验儿童的有趣文章。其中说：许多儿童用语言来说明和解释自己的绘画，其解说的内容比画面上可见的事物总要多一些（例如“树没有叶子了，下雪了，冬天来了”）。另一些儿童则不行，他只能指着所画的事物说：这是甚么，那是甚么（如“这是树”“这是雪”“这是太阳”）……。这个心理学的研究报告当然与我们要谈的艺术不相干，但这使我感触到：前一部分儿童的绘画倒是很有些合乎艺术规律：“象外有旨”，虽然这个“旨”非常简单十分浅陋，但“天下雪，树无叶”的“象”却毕竟表现或要求表现出一个“冬天来了”的“旨”。后者则不然，“象”只是“象”：下雪就是下雪，出太阳就是出太阳……当然，艺术家的创作与这种儿童绘画有很大甚至根本性质上的不同。例如，对儿童说来，有“旨”无“旨”可能主要在于有没有表现“旨”的要求。对艺术家来说，问题常常不在于有没有而在于能不能实现这种要求。艺术总是从生活中提取形象，而形象总是有限和偶然的。而且生活里的形象却并不都具有同等价值：有些生活形象本身就具有更大的内容或意义，相对地说，在那些“有限”中蕴藏着更多的“无限”，“偶然”中体现着更多的“必然”；而另一些生活形象，却是比较狭窄的“有限”和“偶然”，常常“一”就只是“一”，“形”就只是“形”。甚至有些还是纯粹的假象。但不管哪种生活现象，艺术家如果不对之加上一番“由表及里”“去粗存精”的工夫，那就常常总在或多或少或大或小的程度上困在有限的“象”“弦”“言”之中，而不能传达出更多的“旨”“音”“意”来，困在“形”中，不能传出“神”来。例如，我们今天有些作品写炼钢就只是炼钢，画积肥也只是积肥，……看不出也感受不到画面形象之外能有更多更丰富的东西。其实，写炼钢并不必把开会、辩论……等等生活中炼钢的原委过程全盘写上演出，尽管这可以是千真万确的生活现象，但如果只在这表面上作文章，那即使把形象模拟得维妙维肖，铺张得极大极长，到头来，恐怕仍不能脱出表面形象的有限内容和意义，仍不能高度概括地反映出广阔的时代生活的本质，仍只能低于生活。郭沫若同志说得好：“日常生活不等同于艺术，如果话剧只是日常生活的几个切片，那么处处都是舞台，而且不要钱，观众何必还要出钱买票到你剧院来看话剧！”（“戏剧报”1959年5期）。
    所以，我想，任何场景、题材、情节、人物……都只是些具体的有限形象。关键在于如何去对待它处理它：是把它永远囚禁在“这是甚么那是甚么”的“形”中呢，还是使它冲出这种局限让“形”中包含更多的东西。“这是树”“这是雪”“这是在炼钢，积肥”是“形”，齐白石的虾，鲁迅的阿Q，毛主席的“萧瑟秋风今又是，换了人间”也是“形”。但这两种“形”却有多么大的不同：一种是真正有限的孤立的一览无余的“形”，一种是有限中见无限、意味深长、百读不厌的“形”。艺术家应该尽量争取后者，避免前者。中国古代的许多艺术家是很懂得这点的。所以他们总是强调要突破“形似”达到“神似”，强调要“以形写神”、“形神兼备”。悠久丰富的艺术实践使他们了解，艺术形象总是有限的具体：把场景铺张到“三都赋”那样长，也不能写尽生活现象；把花朵刻画到工笔画之细，毕竟仍不如自然物本身。所以，要突破形象的有限，就不能只着重在表面的外形模写或场面铺张上——在“形似”上作文章，而更应尽量使形象具有深度，尽量提炼形象，使它最大限度地反映和表达出丰富的生活真实。也就是使“形”来传“神”。只有“以形写神”，才能“一以当十”。中国传统艺术惊人地具有这种本领，它积累了创造了十分卓越的典型化的方法：善于用很少的东西表现出很多的东西，很有限的形象反映出很广阔的内容。无论国画、戏曲、小说、诗词，莫不皆然。一出小杂剧，可以“观古今之须臾，抚四海于一瞬”；一轴小山水，可以上下数千寻，纵横几万里；小说是粗线条的高度概括的钩勒；诗则更强调“情景交溶”、“景中有意”，从不为写景而写景，它们都毫无例外地一方面特别讲究“惜墨如金”“字斟句酌”；另一方面也特别讲究“一唱三叹”“言有尽而意无穷”。正因为愈重视艺术内容的无限广阔性（“意无穷”），也就愈珍惜艺术形象的有限性（“言有尽”），就愈发严格要求这艺术有限形象中能包含广阔丰富的内容，从而也就愈发惜墨如金，字斟句酌，千锤百炼，精益求精，务使一字一句、一笔一划、一章一节、一举一动，都毫不浪费。蔡宽夫诗话说：“晋宋间诗人造语虽秀拔，然大抵上下句多出一意，如……‘蝉噪林逾静，鸟鸣山更幽’之类，非不工矣，然终不免此病”。以后诗家也都有所谓“合掌”（上下对偶同一意思）之忌。这些艺术鉴赏和评论所以那么苛刻，那么精细地讲求这等道理，就正因为他们了解，形象是有限的。只有“形”中见“神”，以“形”写“神”才成为美（这是我们民族美学的主要精神之一），因此形象就应该是高度的精炼集中，任何多余或重复就与此相违背……。今天我们可以批判地领会和学习这些道理，我们也要珍惜自己的每一个字句、每一个细节、每一下笔触、每一个镜头、每一句台词……，要充分利用艺术的有限形象！把它挖掘又挖掘，提炼再提炼，像鲁迅的小说那样，像毛主席的诗词那样。使一章一节、一字一句都能以极有限的形象传达出极丰富的生活内容。在这个“形”中见出“神”，“一”中见出“十”见出“百”“千”，这才不会使人“一览无余”，而真是“百读不厌”。
    与此相联系的偶然与必然也同此道理。艺术的有限具体形象总是偶然的，透过它反映、表现出来的广阔深远的内容却总必须是必然的。生活现象本身就具有极为丰富复杂的多样性的偶然。同样的坏人仍可以有很大不同。同样的好人，亦然。在同一环境下长大的革命者，既可以是活泼机智开朗的欧阳立安，也可以是沉默寡言稳重的欧阳应坚。生活中的这种个性差异的偶然，并没有妨碍相反倒是加亮了他们作为革命者的必然所各自具有的鲜明特色。共性通过个性，一般通过个别才能存在；必然与偶然，也是这样。在生活中如此，在用形象反映生活的艺术中就更应如此。也只有这样，“形”才能传“神”，“一”才能当“十”，艺术典型才有意义。
    同一“秦香莲”，既可以写成“铡美”——借包公的力量以雪恨，也可以写成“审美”——用自己的手来复仇；同一“昭君出塞”，御弟王龙既可以是京剧里的庸俗的小丑，也可以是湖南地方戏里的一往情深的好人。“铡美”或“审美”，都可以，艺术可以从生活现象本身的变幻多端复杂多样的各个不同侧面的偶然来反映来描写，但这种种反映和描写却都必须是能反映和表现出生活和人们思想感情所要求的必然。所以问题不在于艺术中能否有偶然，而在于这偶然能否和如何表现出必然，在于这偶然的“形”能否和如何表现必然的“神”……。“狂人日记”中的狂人的言吐举动等形象恐怕是最少见最不平常的“偶然”了，但鲁迅却仍可以从这偶然中表现和反映出一种多么深刻真实的社会生活内容的必然。一个“狂人日记”中的狂人，就代表了封建制度下亿万个被压榨被迫害者。狂人愈狂，愈误会愈怕哥哥吃他的肉，愈像偶然，也就愈发揭露了礼教吃人的本质，愈是必然。正如有限与无限一样，在这里，偶然与必然又是辩证地矛盾统一着了。中国艺术，无论小说戏曲、诗、词、绘画，也是特别懂得这道理的。所以，一方面它们很强调“无巧不成书”，“莫不因方以借巧，即势而会奇”，故事性、戏剧性异常强烈紧凑；另一方面却又巧得合理，巧得不露痕迹，好像必然如此，因此令人完全信服。“诗宜朴不宜巧，然必须大巧之朴”（“随园诗话”）。纤巧牵强，“戏不够，神来凑”……，就一向被认为败笔。因为这种偶然没有必然内容。同样，“秦香莲”的结尾如果不是“审”“铡”而是大团圆，这就行不通；相反，“生死牌”如果不是大团圆而是以贺总兵的跋扈收场，这也行不通。观众都不会答应。尽管生活中可以有这种偶然，艺术也必须摒弃。因为这种偶然没有必然性内容，不能反映生活中普遍大量或将普遍大量出现的社会发展必然的偶然，它是一种不能传“神”的单纯偶然的“形”。所以，所谓“诗比历史更真实”，“艺术的真实不同于生活表面的真实”也就是说，艺术所选择集中的偶然比历史和生活中出现的偶然更有必然性；更能反映生活的本质真实；它更巧，也更真；它是一，更是十；它故事性愈强，真实性就必须愈高。“薛宝钗出闺成大礼”之日正是“林黛玉焚稿断痴情”之时，不巧吗？巧。不真实吗？非常真实。强烈的戏剧性的艺术对比加强了主题思想的表现，使人更感到这出悲剧的必然性的力量。曹操可说是个杰出历史人物，可以也应该有翻案的戏。但长久流传在舞台、小说上的奸雄的曹操形象，却也仍是一种具有必然内容的偶然：集中体现在曹操身上（这是偶然。因为历史上有许多比曹操品质更坏的统治者。但请注意“偶然”并不是说没有原因，曹操被塑造成坏人是与其某些品质手段的确阴险毒辣从而为人民所憎恶有关系的）的奸险、阴狠、毒辣，是人民对统治阶级典型的刻画（这是必然）。集中在一个曹操形象上的“偶然”却正是千百个封建统治者脸谱的“必然”。在这种意义上，诗比历史又更真实了。
    深刻了解和掌握艺术中有限与无限、偶然与必然，对今天创造一个万紫千红百花齐放富有多样性独创性的艺术形象的园地，有重要的意义。忽略艺术的有限和偶然，就容易丢失生活本身的多种多样的丰富复杂的形象，而让必然和无限以赤裸裸的姿态出现。戏剧中的保守的工程师都必戴眼镜、穿西服和工人争持……，这常常是仅从逻辑概念上来表现无限和必然的原故：保守的工程师常具有资产阶级思想以至生活习气，这确乎是生活中无可怀疑的无限必然。但是，它们赤裸裸地出现，而不通过生活本身就具有而艺术应该把它更集中更突出来表现的十分具体的有限和偶然，观众得到的就只是一些逻辑概念，戏就不“耐看”了。马克思主义是强调艺术的倾向性的，但同时也指出这倾向“应当是不要特别地说出，而要让它自己从场面和情节中流露出来”（恩格斯给明娜·考茨基的信）。外国有美学家曾说，美感必须是想像力和理智的谐和的自由的运动。无论是自然主义的形象的有限或者是赤裸裸的逻辑的必然，就都不能给人以发挥想像力的余地，去低徊流连反复玩味其“象外之旨”“弦外之音”而只剩下光秃秃的理智的认识：“这是甚么，那是甚么”，那当然就不“耐看”了。
    所以，艺术中如果光是有限和偶然，就常常是自然主义或形式主义；如光是无限和必然，就容易成公式主义和逻辑论文，两者都不是美。美，就正如车尔尼雪夫斯基所说，它是包罗万有而又变化多端的东西。包罗万有是它的无限丰富的必然的生活内容，而变化多端却正是它的多样偶然的有限的艺术形式。要包罗万有而又变化多端，就要形神兼备，“一”以当“十”，以“形”写“神”。
