    Decisive Action, Comprehensive Planning

    The present time is a crucial period for agricultural production (including animal husbandry, fisheries, etc.). Summer crops are about to be harvested, autumn crops are being sown or require strengthened field management, and large livestock, pigs, chickens, ducks, geese, fish, etc., are in their mating or breeding season. Opportunity knocks but once. We must act decisively, strengthen leadership, mobilize the enthusiasm of the broad masses from all aspects, and immediately launch a summer production upsurge, the sooner the better!

    In the busy agricultural season, can we manage both grain production and diversified operations, and launch a comprehensive agricultural production upsurge? Yes. The Daqiao Commune in Wanzai County, Jiangxi Province, has given a positive answer with compelling facts.

    In the Daqiao Commune, not everyone understood this issue all at once. Initially, a few cadres focused on one aspect during the busy agricultural season and neglected others. Some even believed that this phenomenon was unavoidable. This is not the case. Neglecting one thing for another only reflects a lack of comprehensive understanding of the relationship between the principal and the secondary aspects in our work. Of course, work must have a focus and a primary aspect. The focus and primary aspect should be guaranteed completion first with the main force. In terms of agriculture, the focus and primary aspect are the grain and cotton production increase targets proposed by the state. Each commune must concentrate its main force on prominently grasping grain or cotton production. However, emphasizing guaranteeing the focus does not mean that the secondary and general aspects can be relaxed or even ignored.

    The primary and secondary aspects are by no means isolated from each other; they are interconnected and mutually reinforcing. From a broader perspective, the comprehensive development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries, the simultaneous promotion of self-sufficient production and commodity production, are all indispensable. Neglecting any one of them will affect the development of the entire national economy. From the perspective of a commune, neglecting this or lacking that is detrimental to the commune's expanded production and increased income for its members. For example, raising fewer pigs, chickens, ducks, geese, etc., will not only directly reduce income but also lead to a shortage of fertilizer for farmland, preventing increased production or even causing reduced production. Therefore, in our work, we must neither fail to distinguish between the important and the urgent nor focus solely on the primary aspect while neglecting others.

    Solving the problem of ideological understanding is only half the battle, or even just the beginning of solving the problem. We must further solve some practical problems in our work. What is particularly important is to comprehensively and rationally arrange various productions in terms of manpower, materials, and time, based on the specific circumstances of the time and place, so that everyone is in their proper position and gets what they deserve. To achieve this goal, it is necessary to fully mobilize the masses for discussion. The Daqiao Commune did exactly that. As a result of the mass discussions, they summarized several important guidelines: First, in terms of the arrangement of business projects: instead of grasping everything, large and small, near and far, they first grasped the main projects that must be grasped currently and locally. This ensured that the main projects were not missed, that the season and time were not missed, and that the labor force was not too dispersed, so as not to affect grain production. Second, in terms of labor arrangement: they tried to find ways to minimize or avoid occupying the stronger labor force and labor time necessary for grain production. Third, on some appropriate projects, they implemented a combination of large collectives and small collectives, small collectives and individuals, and promptly helped commune members solve specific problems such as feed and young livestock, thus fully mobilizing the enthusiasm of organizations at all levels of the commune (especially production teams) and every commune member.

    The practice of the Daqiao Commune proves that as long as we strengthen the Party's ideological leadership, fully mobilize the masses, and make reasonable arrangements, we can launch an upsurge in increasing the production of major crops while also launching an upsurge in increasing the production of pigs, sheep, chickens, geese, ducks, fish, etc.

    当机立断，全面安排
    目前正是农业生产（包括畜牧、渔业等生产）的关键时期。夏收作物就要收获，秋收作物正在播种或正需加强田间管理，大牲畜和猪鸡鸭鹅鱼等正是配种或繁殖的季节。机不可失，时不再来。必须当机立断，加强领导，从各方面调动广大群众的积极性，立即掀起夏季生产高潮，越快越好！
    在大农忙季节，能不能做到既搞好粮食生产又搞好多种经营，掀起全面的农业生产高潮？能。江西省万载县的大桥公社用有力的事实，作了肯定的答复。
    在大桥公社，也并不是所有的人都一下子弄清楚了这个问题的。开始，有少数干部在农忙时期抓了这头，丢了那头。甚至有人竟认为这种现象是不可避免的。其实不然。顾此失彼，只不过反映了人们在工作中对于主要与次要的关系还缺乏全面的认识。当然，工作必须有重点，有主要方面。对于重点和主要方面应该首先以主要力量去保证完成。就农业而论，重点和主要方面是国家提出的粮、棉两大增产指标，每个公社都必须集中主力突出地抓粮食或棉花生产。但是，强调保证重点，并不意味着次要的、一般的就可以放松，甚至丢掉不管。
    主要的方面和次要的方面决不是各自孤立的，而是互相联系，互相促进的。从大的方面讲，农林牧副渔五业全面发展，自给性生产与商品性生产同时并举，缺一不可；缺一都会影响整个国民经济的发展。从一个公社来讲，如果丢了这个，少了那个，对公社扩大生产和增加社员收入，都是不利的。例如，少养了猪鸡鸭鹅等等，不但会直接减少收入，还会使农田缺少肥料，不能增产甚至减产。因此，我们在工作上既不能不分轻重缓急，也不能只抓重点而不顾其他。
    思想认识问题解决了，仅仅是解决了问题的一半，甚至只是解决问题的开端，还必须更进一步解决工作中的一些实际问题。特别重要的是根据当时当地的具体情况，从人力、物力、时间等方面全面地、合理地安排各项生产，做到各就其位，各得其所。欲达到此目的，必须充分发动群众进行讨论。大桥公社正是这样做的。他们发动群众讨论的结果，总结出来了几条重要方针：第一，在经营项目的安排方面：不是大小远近一齐抓，而首先是抓当前当地必须抓的主要项目。这样既保证了主要项目不遗漏，不错过季节和时机，又使劳动力不过于分散，不影响粮食生产。第二，在劳动力的安排方面：尽量想办法做到少占用或不占用粮食生产方面所必需的较强的劳动力和劳动时间。第三，在一些适当的项目上，实行大集体与小集体、小集体与个人相结合的办法，并及时帮助社员解决饲料、仔畜等具体问题，把公社各级组织（特别是生产小队）和每个社员的积极性都充分地调动起来。
    大桥公社的实践证明，只要加强党的思想领导，充分发动群众，进行合理安排，在掀起增产主要农作物的高潮的同时，也能够掀起增产猪羊鸡鹅鸭鱼等等的高潮。
