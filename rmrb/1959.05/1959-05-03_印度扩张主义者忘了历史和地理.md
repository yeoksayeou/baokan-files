        We completely agree with Premier Zhou Enlai's government work report and the reports of Vice Premiers Li Fuchun, Li Xiannian, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and Vice Chairman Li Weihan.

        The former Tibetan local government and upper-class reactionary elements launched an armed rebellion, and the State Council made timely and correct handling of it. Through the heroic battles of the Tibet Military Region troops of the People's Liberation Army and the active support of the Tibetan people for the People's Liberation Army, this rebellion has been quelled. This rebellion has not had the slightest impact on our country's peaceful construction, nor has it caused any confusion in the ideological understanding of the people of the whole country. It only exposed a small group of Tibetan reactionaries supported by British imperialists and Indian expansionists, sent them to their graves, and cleared the way for social reforms in Tibet. The launch and suppression of this rebellion made people more clearly realize that the unity of the socialist motherland and national unity are the highest interests of all ethnic groups, thereby promoting greater consolidation of national unity.

        The rebellion of the upper-class reactionary elements in Tibet is obviously not a national issue, a religious issue, or an issue of local autonomy. The more than one million working people in Tibet lived a life of cattle and horses under cruel oppression and exploitation. It was not the Han or other ethnic groups in China who oppressed and exploited the working people of Tibet, but the serf owners headed by this small group of reactionary elements. Some Tibetan Buddhist temples, doctrines, and monks have been damaged and killed. Those who carried out the damage and killing were not followers of other religions, let alone atheists, but this small group of Buddhist scum in Tibet who deceived people in cassocks. It was not the Han people or the Central People's Government that hindered the establishment of the Tibetan Autonomous Government, but this small group of reactionary elements who held high positions in the former Tibetan local government. National regional autonomy and freedom of religious belief have long been stipulated in our country's constitution, and the Central People's Government, the People's Liberation Army stationed in Tibet, and administrative cadres have correctly implemented this policy. China is a large family composed of more than 50 ethnic groups. In this large family, except for Tibet, autonomous regions, autonomous prefectures, and autonomous counties have been organized, and autonomy has long been implemented. If it hadn't been for the long-term obstruction of this small group of upper-class reactionary elements in Tibet, the autonomous region government would have been established long ago.

        The essence of the Tibetan rebellion is that the corrupt and reactionary serf owner group attempted to maintain the dark serf system forever, and it was a betrayal of the socialist motherland. This rebellion was instigated by British imperialists and Indian expansionists. The weapons used by the Khampa bandits, who had long been sheltered by the former Tibetan local government, were obtained through the Indian border. When the Chinese People's Liberation Army began to quell the rebellion, Indian expansionists clamored and frantically attacked the Chinese government. When the rebellious elements kidnapped the Dalai Lama and fled to India, they immediately received the support of Indian expansionists. Indian diplomatic officials also distributed so-called "statements by the Dalai Lama" attacking China. Are these facts not enough to show that Indian expansionists participated in instigating the Tibetan rebellion?

        In order to support the Tibetan rebellion, Indian expansionists were so crazy that they forgot history and geography, forgot that India was a country that had only recently freed itself from the shackles of imperialism. They threw the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence jointly advocated by China and India to the winds. They openly regarded our Tibet as India's sphere of influence and rudely interfered in our country's internal affairs. What is especially intolerable is that they dared to openly insult the image of our beloved leader Chairman Mao. We express our boundless anger and condemnation for this. We cannot help but ask the Indian expansionists: What do you want to do on the Tibet issue? The old British imperialists, who wanted to maintain their colonial rule for many years, have run into walls everywhere. Do you think it is possible to follow the old path of British imperialism and carry out colonial expansion to the southwestern border of socialist China?

        We solemnly warn the Indian expansionists: Open your eyes and look at the trend of the times, and see if socialist China is the same China as before. Now, if you want to expand your influence to the border of socialist China, your heads will be smashed on the Himalayas! Now it is the 1950s. If you still want to learn the tricks of British imperialism in the 18th and 19th centuries to manipulate yourselves, the result can only be to damage Sino-Indian friendship, lose the trust of Asian and African countries, and fall into isolation. Can't you even see such a clear world situation like the sun? China does not want to invade an inch of any country's land, nor will it lose an inch of its own land in exchange for any country's sympathy. Tibet is Chinese territory. Quelling the rebellion and carrying out social reforms in Tibet is China's internal affair. If any country interferes arbitrarily, we will give it a merciless counterattack.

        We will bring the spirit of the conference back to Hubei Province to convey it, mobilize people from all walks of life and the broad masses of working people to continue to go all out, overfulfill the tasks on the economic and cultural and educational fronts in 1959, strengthen the unity of all ethnic groups, strengthen the ideological transformation of bourgeois elements and bourgeois intellectuals, and respond with practical actions to the provocations of Indian expansionists and reactionaries from all countries against our country.

    印度扩张主义者忘了历史和地理

    我们完全同意周恩来总理的政府工作报告和李富春、李先念副总理、彭真副委员长、李维汉副主席的报告。
    原西藏地方政府和上层反动分子发动武装叛乱，国务院及时作了正确处理。通过人民解放军西藏军区部队的英勇战斗，西藏人民对人民解放军的积极支援，这次叛乱已经被平息了。这次叛乱对我们国家的和平建设没有发生丝毫影响，也没有在全国人民的思想认识上引起丝毫混乱，它只是把英帝国主义和印度扩张主义分子支持下的一小撮西藏反动分子公开暴露出来，送进了坟墓，为西藏的社会改革扫清了道路。这次叛乱的发动和平息，使人们更清楚地认识了社会主义祖国的统一和民族团结是各族人民的最高利益，从而促进民族团结更加巩固。
    西藏上层反动分子的叛乱很明显地不是民族问题、宗教问题，更不是地方自治问题。西藏一百多万劳动人民是在残酷压迫剥削下过着牛马生活，压迫剥削西藏劳动人民的不是汉族或中国的其他民族，而是以这一小撮反动分子为首的农奴主。西藏佛教寺庙、教规、僧众有些曾经遭受过破坏和杀害，进行破坏和杀害的不是其他宗教徒，更不是无神论者，而是西藏这一小撮披着袈裟骗人的佛教败类，阻挠西藏自治政府成立的不是汉人，更不是中央人民政府，而是高踞原西藏地方政府位置的这一小撮反动分子。民族区域自治、宗教信仰自由是我国宪法早已明文规定了的，中央人民政府和驻藏人民解放军以及行政干部是正确执行了这个政策的。中国是一个由五十多个民族组成的大家庭，在这个大家庭中，除西藏之外，都组织了自治区、自治州、自治县，早就实行了自治。西藏假如没有这一小撮上层反动分子的长期阻挠，自治区政府早已成立了。
    西藏叛乱实质上是腐朽反动的农奴主集团妄图永远维持黑暗的农奴制度，对社会主义祖国的叛变，这次叛乱是由英帝国主义和印度扩张主义分子策动的。原西藏地方政府长期包庇的康巴叛匪所用的武装是通过印度国境得到的。当中国人民解放军一开始平息叛乱的时候，印度扩张主义分子就大喊大叫，拼命攻击中国政府，叛国分子劫持达赖喇嘛逃到印度，马上就有印度扩张主义分子的支持。印度外交官员还散发了攻击中国的所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”。这些事实还不足以说明西藏叛乱有印度扩张主义分子参加策动么？
    为了支持西藏叛乱，印度扩张主义分子们疯狂到忘记了历史和地理，忘记了印度是不久前才从帝国主义枷锁下摆脱出来的一个国家，他们把中印两国共同倡导的五项原则丢到九霄云外，他们公然把我国的西藏当作印度的势力范围，粗暴干涉我国的内政。尤其不能令人容忍的是，他们竟敢公然侮辱我们敬爱的领袖毛主席的像，我们对此表示无比的愤怒和谴责。我们不禁要问印度的扩张主义分子们：在西藏问题上你们想干什么？老牌的英帝国主义想保持它统治多年的殖民地，已经到处碰壁，你们想走英帝国主义老路向社会主义中国的西南边境进行殖民扩张，这是走得通的吗？
    我们严正地警告印度扩张主义分子：你们睁开眼睛看一看时代的潮流，看一看社会主义中国是不是从前的中国，现在要向社会主义中国边境扩张势力，你们的头将会碰碎在喜马拉雅山上！现在是二十世纪五十年代了，你们还要学英帝国主义十八、九世纪摆布你们自己的阴谋手段，其结果只能是破坏中印友谊，失掉亚非国家的信任，而自陷于孤立。你们连这样像太阳一般明显的世界局势都看不清楚？中国不想侵略任何国家一寸土地，也决不肯失去自己的一寸土地换取任何国家的同情。西藏是中国的领土，在西藏平息叛乱，进行社会改革，是中国的内政，任何国家妄加干涉，我们就要对它给以无情的反击。
    我们将把大会的精神带回湖北地方，进行传达，动员各界人士与广大劳动人民一起，继续鼓足干劲，超额完成一九五九年经济战线和文化教育战线上的任务，加强各族人民的团结，加强资产阶级分子和资产阶级知识分子的思想改造，以实际行动回答印度扩张主义分子和一切国家的反动分子对我国的挑衅。
