Comrade Chairman, fellow delegates:
I am a worker from the fine yarn workshop of the Chongqing No. 611 Cotton Mill. I am here to report on our factory's work situation to the conference. This is the first time I have spoken at such a large conference. If I say anything inappropriate, I hope the delegates will correct me.

Under the correct leadership of the Party, our yarn mill, like all other fronts, has made many inspiring achievements in the high tide of the Great Leap Forward across the country.

Creating the "Method to Eliminate White Spots on Fine Yarn Joints," Producing Cloth Without "Lumps"

Let me start with my own experiences. As all delegates know, in a yarn mill, if the yarn joints are not properly made, they will become white spots, and the woven cloth will become uneven "lumpy cloth." The Ministry of Textile Industry once summarized a new technology called the "Untwisting Joint Method" to eliminate such defective products and promoted it nationwide. As a result of applying this technology, the quality of the cloth improved a lot compared to the past, but it was still difficult to completely eliminate the white spots. How should this problem be solved? At that time, I was a member of the advanced experience promotion group in our factory, and I felt responsible for improving it and should not ignore it. But then I thought, if someone asked me, "You used to say this experience was good and advised everyone to adopt it, why do you say it's bad now?" Just as I was hesitating, the factory Party committee held an on-site meeting to eliminate old rules in the maintenance workshop, and on the spot, many rules and regulations that had always been considered sacred and inviolable were abolished. The factory Party committee and the trade union organization used these events as examples to encourage everyone to strive to be a person who dares to think, dares to speak, and dares to act. The Party's kind call awakened everyone, and also awakened me. From then on, I dispelled my own thoughts of gains and losses and began to think day and night about how to eliminate white spots on fine yarn. After months of continuous efforts, under the education of the Party and with the help of comrades, I finally successfully created the "Method to Eliminate White Spots on Fine Yarn Joints." It is estimated that the 30,000 pieces of cotton yarn knitwear produced by our factory last year alone created wealth of 180,000 yuan for the country. In the future, if this method is promoted nationwide, everyone will no longer have to worry about buying "lumpy cloth." This experience of mine is just a small example of all the comrades in our factory, under the ideological education of the Party, going all out and making a leap forward.

Engaging in Technical Innovation, Fundamentally Changing the Face of the Textile Industry

In the process of the Great Leap Forward, the struggle between new and old ideas was fierce. I remember when our factory started the mass technical and cultural revolution, some skeptics and conservatives once said, "The state of machine production in the textile industry has been finalized. At present, only small improvements can be made, and technical revolution is impossible." They also said, "The textile industry is a流水式 manual operation, restricted by equipment, raw cotton, and climate, and it is not easy to innovate." Some people even said, "Innovation can only be done by engineering and technical personnel. Laymen and ordinary workers cannot do it." However, the facts were exactly the opposite of the estimates of these conservatives and skeptics. In the high tide of the technical revolution, comrades proposed more than 100,000 suggestions in just one week, of which more than 50 were major innovation projects that were successfully tested. There was also a centrifugal spinning machine, which was an important invention in the modern textile industry. And the proposer of this creation was three young technicians who had not been out of school for long—Guo Depei, Mao Xingzhong, and Chen Haochang. After the active education and support of the factory Party and government, and the concerted efforts of engineering and technical personnel, this proposal was soon successful. We solved the problems that capitalist countries had not solved for more than 30 years in just a few months. This is entirely a brilliant achievement of the collective creation of workers under the wise leadership of the Party.

In the comprehensive Great Leap Forward of the second half of last year, with steel as the key link and a massive increase in production, the number of spindles in our factory suddenly doubled. Although the supply of machine parts was temporarily difficult, under the leadership and call of the Party, all the employees of the factory vigorously engaged in the combination of indigenous and foreign methods, replacing foreign with indigenous, and with the spirit of hard work, painstaking effort, clever work, and poor work, they made their own paper cones, paper cotton strip barrels,土车床, cement spinning machines,土摇纱机, cableways, etc. This not only met the needs of production, but also solved the temporary shortage of machine axle raw materials, which played a decisive role in our factory's guarantee of the comprehensive and over-fulfillment of the state production plan for 1958.

Our factory has also made excellent achievements in spinning high-grade yarn from low-grade cotton. In capitalist countries, it is generally believed that to spin high-count yarns of 100 counts or more, high-grade cotton and精纺 machines must be used, but we only used low-grade cotton for spinning 20-count yarn, and continuously trial-spun 80-count, 120-count, 160-count, 180-count, 195-count, 210-count, up to 230-count high-grade yarn counts.

In addition, the major innovation projects proposed by our factory, such as high-speed carding machine steel and thick combined machine, and non-air jet spinning, can put textile industry technology on the road of continuous, automated, and rationalized production, and fundamentally change the face of the textile industry.

In the process of the mass technical revolution, the mental outlook of the entire factory's employees has also undergone significant changes. In the movement, 1,027 advanced producers emerged, accounting for about 30% of the total number of employees in the factory. This is a remarkable change.

In order to launch the cultural revolution movement, our factory adopted various advanced teaching methods and active measures to eliminate illiteracy among all young and middle-aged people in the factory. The factory also runs spare-time middle schools, spare-time technical middle schools, and industrial middle schools, so that employees can fully enjoy learning opportunities in their spare time. When vigorously engaging in literary and artistic creation activities, employees wrote a lot of poems and articles, many of which were published in large newspapers and magazines. They unanimously used literary and technical works full of noble emotions to warmly praise the Party, praise Chairman Mao, praise our great era, and praise our better future.

The overall leap forward situation of our great motherland is also reflected in the development speed of our factory. Last year, the state invested more than 4 million yuan in our factory to build a spinning workshop and equipment that doubled the original production capacity, and added more than 1,500 workers. The rapid growth and development of these equipment and the working class team are the basic conditions for promoting the leap forward in industrial construction.

The Technical Innovation in Chongqing's Textile Enterprises has Achieved Brilliant Success

The great technical revolution movement has also achieved brilliant achievements in all textile enterprises in Chongqing. There are 144 relatively significant and successful innovation proposals, such as electrostatic spinning, electrostatic flocking, double-layer weaving, double-sided weaving, multi-layer dyeing, double-ended double-pot cooking, and double-layer weaving. The dyeing and spinning workshop of the No. 610 Factory and the China Wool Textile Factory has now become a multi-layered, continuous production workshop, which not only increases the dyeing capacity by two to three times, but also liberates workers from tedious labor due to continuous production.

This year, major achievements have been made in the research of centrifugal spindles. The key problems that had not been solved last year, such as yarn breakage after doffing and starting the machine and the spindle speed not reaching 20,000 rpm, were solved in February this year. The effect of leaving the yarn end after doffing has reached more than 90%. More than 1,500 centrifugal spindles have been put into production in the city. The centrifugal spindles in our factory have also been put into production. The city has used centrifugal spindles to spin 20-count, 32-count, 42-count, and 80-count yarns of various counts. According to incomplete statistics, 50,000 pieces of cotton yarn have been spun from 80-count yarn alone. But from the current situation, the speed of the centrifugal spindles cannot reach 20,000 rpm, and the capacity of the centrifugal cup is still too small. Although there are still many difficulties to solve these problems at present, our working class is not afraid of any difficulties. We must strive to complete it in July this year, and present a gift to the "National Centrifugal Spinning On-site Conference" to be held in Chongqing by the Ministry of Textile Industry, and strive to make more and greater gifts for the 10th anniversary of the founding of the great People's Republic of China.

In order to thank the Party for its education, and to present a gift to the 10th anniversary of the National Day, I will actively assist my factory comrades to quickly put new technologies such as high-speed carding machines and simple fine yarn super-large drafts into production. At the same time, I will strive to put the mechanized and automated spinning cleaning that I proposed this year into official production as soon as possible, and produce more and better yarn and cloth for the motherland and the people.

Finally, I wholeheartedly support the reports made by Premier Zhou Enlai and other leaders, and I am determined to work hard to complete and over-fulfill the 1959 national economic plan.

    党的领导英明伟大，工人力量无尽无穷
    张利珍代表的发言主席、各位代表：
    我是重庆市六一一纱厂细纱车间的工人，在这里，我把我们厂的工作情况向大会作一汇报，我在这样的大会上讲话，生平还是第一次，有说得不恰当的地方，还望代表们教正。
    我们这个纱厂，在党的正确领导下，也和其他各个战线上一样，在全国大跃进的高潮里，也作出了许多令人鼓舞的成绩。
    创造“消灭细纱接头白点操作法”，不出“疙瘩布”
    先从我经历的事情说起。各位代表都知道：在纱厂里纺出来的细纱，只要接头接得不好，成了白点以后，织出来的布就要变为粗细不匀的“疙瘩布”。中纺部为了消灭这样次品，曾经总结出一套新技术，名叫“解拈接头操作法”，在全国范围内推广，各厂应用这一技术的结果，布的品质比以往改进了很多，但是完全消灭白点，还有困难。这一问题该怎样去解决呢？我当时就是我们厂里推广先进经验一组的组员，觉得自己有责任去改进，不应该置之不理。可是转眼一想，如果有人问到我：“你过去说这个经验很好，劝大家采用，现在怎么又说它不好呢？”正在我拿不定主意的时候，厂党委召开了保全车间破除陈规的现场会议，当场把许多一向被认为神圣不可侵犯的规章制度，都革除了，厂党委和工会组织以这些事为例，鼓励大家努力做一个敢想、敢说、敢干的人。党的亲切的呼声，唤醒了大家，也唤醒了我。从那时起，我才打消了自己患得患失的念头，开始夜以继日地思索如何消灭细纱白点的办法，经过几个月不断的努力，在党的教育和同志们的帮助下，我终于成功地创造了“消灭细纱接头白点操作法”。据估计仅仅我厂去年生产的三万件棉纱针织品，就替国家创造了十八万元的财富，今后把这个方法推广到全国，大家就可以永久不再担心买进“疙瘩布”了。我这一段经历，正是我们厂里全体同志在党的思想教育下，鼓足干劲，在跃进中一个小小的例证。
    大闹技术革新，使纺织工业面貌发生根本性变化
    在大跃进过程中，新旧思想的斗争是激烈的。记得我厂在开始大闹技术与文化革命时，有些怀疑派和保守派曾经说：“纺织工业的机器生产状态已经定型了，目前只能作些小的改进，不可能进行技术革命。”又说：“纺织工业是流水式的手工操作，受设备、原棉和气候的限制，不容易革新。”甚至有的人还说：“革新只能是工程技术人员的事，外行和普通工人不行。”但是，事实恰好和这些保守派和怀疑派的估计相反，同志们在技术革命的高潮中，只用了短短一周的时间，就提出建议十万多条，其中经过试验成功的重大革新项目有五十多项，还有一项离心式纺织机，更是近代纺织工业界的重要发明。而这项创造的建议者，是三个离开学校不久的青年技术员——郭德培、毛兴中、陈浩昌。经过厂党政的积极教育和支持，工程技术人员的齐心协作，这个建议不久即获得了成功。我们前后总共只几个月的时间，就解决了资本主义国家三十多年来未曾解决的问题，这完全是党的英明领导下工人们集体创作的辉煌成就。
    在去年下半年以钢为纲，大搞生产加番的全面大跃进中，我厂纱锭数目骤然增加了一倍。虽然机器零件一时供应困难，但在党的领导和号召下，全厂职工，大搞土洋结合，以土代洋，以大干、苦干、巧干、穷干的精神，自制纸筒管，纸棉条桶，土车床，水泥细纱车、土摇纱机，缆车道等等。既满足了生产需要，又解决了机轴原材暂时供应紧张的困难，这对我厂保证全面和超额完成一九五八年的国家生产计划起到了决定性的作用。
    我厂还有作出了用低级棉纺出高级纱的优异成绩。在资本主义国家里，一般认为纺一百支以上高支纱，必须用高级棉，用精纺机，但我们却只用纺二十支纱的低级棉，连续试纺成八十支，一百二十支，一百六十支，一百八十支，一百九十五支，二百一十支，直到二百三十支的高级纱支。
    此外，我们厂所提出的，高速梳棉机钢并粗联合机，无气啳纺纱等重大革新项目，可使纺织工业技术走上连续化、自动化、合理化的道路，使纺织工业面貌发生了根本性的变化。
    在大闹技术革命的过程中，全厂职工的精神面貌也有了显著的变化。在运动中，涌现出了先进生产者一千零二十七人，约占全厂职工人数的百分之三十，这是一个了不起的变化。
    为了展开文化革命运动，我厂采用了各种先进的教学方法和积极措施，使全厂的青壮年文盲全部扫除，工厂还办起业余中学，业余技术中学，工业中学，使职工在业余时充分享有学习的机会。大搞文艺创作活动时，职工们大写诗文，其中有许多较优秀的作品，发表在大型报刊杂志上。他们一致用充满高尚情感的文学技术作品，热情地歌颂党，歌颂毛主席，歌颂我们这个伟大的时代，歌颂我们更加美好的将来。
    我们伟大祖国的全面大跃进的局面也表现在我们厂里的发展速度方面。去年国家在我们厂里投资四百多万元，兴建了一座比原生产能力提高一倍的纺纱厂房设备，新添了一千五百多工人，这些设备和工人阶级队伍的迅速壮大、成长，正是促进工业建设飞跃的基本条件。
    重庆全市纺织企业中的技术革新取得辉煌成就
    伟大的技术革命运动，在我们全重庆市纺织企业中，也取得了辉煌的成就，较为重大的成功的革新建议共有一百四十四件，如静电纺纱，静电植绒，双层织布，双面织布，多层染色，煮布双头双锅，双层织呢等。六一○厂和中国毛纺织厂染纺车间，目前已成为多层化、连续化的生产车间，这不仅使染色能力提高了两倍到三倍，而且由于连续化的生产，已使工人从繁琐的劳动中解放出来。
    今年对于离心锭的研究工作又取得了重大的成就，去年还没解决的：落纱开车后要断头和锭杯速度不能达到两万转的关键问题，在今年二月已得到了解决，落纱留头效果已达百分之九十以上，全市已开出一千五百多个离心式纱锭进行生产。我们厂里的离心锭也已投入生产，全市已用离心式纺纱锭子纺出二十支，三十二支，四十二支，八十支各种纱支。据不完全统计，光八十支纱就纺出棉纱五万件纱。但从目前情况来看，离心锭子的速度还不能达到二万转，离心杯的容量还嫌小得一点。虽然当前要解决这些问题仍有许多困难，但我们工人阶级是什么困难也不畏惧的，我们一定要争取在今年七月间完成，为中纺部即将在重庆市召开的“全国离心式纺纱现场会议”献礼，并争取为伟大的中华人民共和国国庆十周年大庆作出更多、更大的献礼。
    为了感谢党对我的教养，为了给国庆十周年献礼，我一定积极协助我厂同志把高速梳棉机，简易细纱超大牵伸等新技术迅速地投入生产。同时要将我在今年提出的纺纱清洁机械化，自动化也争取早日正式投入生产，为祖国和人民生产出更多更好的纱布来。
    最后，我衷心地拥护周恩来总理和其他各位首长所作的报告，并且决心为完成和超额完成一九五九年国民经济计划而奋斗。
