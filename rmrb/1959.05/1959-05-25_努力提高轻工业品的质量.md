Light industrial products are closely related to people's lives. Over the past few years, while developing production, the light industry has made unremitting efforts to improve product quality and has achieved great results. Especially last year, there was a great leap forward in output, quality was also improved, and the variety of designs and colors also increased. Many products have also been well received by consumers at home and abroad. Since the beginning of this year, the quality of many products has continued to improve. However, the quality of some enterprises' products has declined. For example, some letterpress printing paper is overweight, some rubber shoes are prone to degumming and cracking, some dry batteries have shorter discharge times, and some thermos bottles have high damage rates. Although some damaged products have not entered the market, this situation has caused losses to the country and should be taken seriously and improved immediately.

There are many reasons for the current inadequate quality of some light industrial products. The main reason is that some comrades have incorrect views on the relationship between quality and quantity. For example, some people believe that the current demand for light industrial products is very large, and they are often in short supply. Therefore, it is necessary to quickly increase the quantity, and it does not matter if the quality is a bit poor. This idea of ​​only paying attention to quantity and ignoring quality is wrong. Of course, in order to appropriately meet the needs of the people's lives, the light industry sector should do its best to increase production. The state has already made corresponding arrangements in this regard, and all employees in the light industry sector are working hard to complete and strive to overfulfill the state plan. However, it must also be understood that when people spend money to buy things, they always hope to buy things that meet the quality requirements. If the quality does not meet the requirements, consumers will not welcome it. At any time, high yield cannot be separated from high quality. Especially at a time when the growth of light industrial products cannot keep up with the needs of the people, grasping quality is even more important. For example, after communization, the vast number of rural women participated in agricultural labor, and many women in cities also became employed and had no time to make shoes. The need to supply shoes has greatly increased. If the rubber shoes, sneakers, leather shoes, and cloth shoes we produce are strong and durable, and the wearing time is extended by one-third compared to the past, from the perspective of use value, it is equivalent to an increase in production of 30% for the whole year. Conversely, if the quality is not good and the wearing time is shortened by one-third compared to the past, it is actually equivalent to a 30% reduction in production. Obviously, this will not only increase the burden on consumers, but also increase the market supply task. "Improving quality is increasing quantity" is very obvious from here.

Some people also feel that the current supply of raw materials for light industry is not abundant, and saving is the primary task. If quality is emphasized, some products will inevitably consume more raw materials. Therefore, in order to save raw materials, it does not matter if the quality is poor. This view is also obviously wrong. It is true that diligence and frugality in building the country is our country's socialist construction policy. At any time, we must pay attention to saving and oppose waste. However, savings must be rational and practically meaningful under the premise of ensuring quality, otherwise the gains will not outweigh the losses. Reducing product quality in order to save raw materials and materials may seem like saving on the surface, but the poor quality of products and their susceptibility to damage are a great waste. Moreover, high-quality products do not necessarily consume more raw materials than poor-quality products. Sometimes, using more raw materials can actually reduce product quality. Taking letterpress printing paper as an example, each square meter weighs 52 grams, and the quality is excellent. If more pulp is used, and the weight reaches more than 60 grams, the paper will be too thick, and the quality will be reduced. This fact clearly shows that improving product quality does not necessarily require increasing the use of raw materials. Of course, some products have seen their quality decline due to inappropriate saving of raw materials in the past, and now, in order to ensure quality, it is necessary to increase some raw materials. However, this increase is necessary and reasonable and cannot be called wasting raw materials. The so-called "saving" in the past was unreasonable.

Some comrades also say that the quality of raw materials for some light industrial products is not good, and it is impossible to produce products with better quality. It is undeniable that the quality of products largely depends on the quality of raw materials, but it cannot be said that this is the only factor determining product quality. What matters is how much subjective effort people put in. If people's subjective effort is not enough, even with good raw materials, they often fail to produce high-quality products. Conversely, if we recognize the importance of improving product quality and strive to take various measures, we can produce high-quality products even with relatively poor raw materials. Recently, the Shanghai Jin'gang Rubber Factory's use of low-grade rubber to make high-quality sneakers is the most vivid illustration. Starting from the first quarter, the supply of high-quality smoked sheet rubber used to make sneakers in this factory was insufficient, and it had to use crepe sheet rubber of poorer quality. This kind of rubber has more impurities and poor wear resistance. At that time, some people were worried that the quality of the sneakers would decline. However, the Party organization of this factory believed that as long as the masses were fully mobilized and the collective wisdom of the masses was brought into play, it was possible to make high-quality sneakers with crepe sheet rubber. They relied on the masses to find ways and explored formulas and operating methods for making high-quality sneakers with low-grade rubber, and established a series of inspection systems. In this way, although crepe sheet rubber was used entirely in April, the wear resistance of the sneakers was greatly enhanced compared with the products produced in the first quarter, and basically reached the specifications of high-quality rubber products.

Obviously, to improve product quality, we must first start with correcting our understanding. After solving ideological problems, we must also take a series of effective and specific measures. In the current movement to increase production and practice economy, leading cadres at all levels must attach importance to improving quality, and at the same time, vigorously explain to the workers and masses the important significance of improving quality, conduct an education in high quality and high yield, and carry out mass quality inspections. Existing large and medium-sized modern enterprises should focus on mobilizing the masses to revise and supplement some necessary technical management and quality inspection systems in light of the quality requirements of their own enterprises. Large-scale enterprises that have just been put into production should focus on improving the technical level of new workers and establishing necessary technical and quality management systems. In various small enterprises that combine indigenous and foreign methods, the focus should be on improving production technology and passing the technical barrier. Enterprises that have experienced poor quality must use methods such as carefully accounting, reasoning, holding quality exhibitions, and directly visiting consumers to mobilize the masses to vigorously attack the quality barrier in order to achieve improvement as scheduled. For enterprises, workshops, and individuals that have made achievements in improving quality, their experiences must be summarized in a timely manner, advanced models must be established, and their experiences must be promoted.

At present, when the raw materials for light industrial products cannot meet the needs of increased production, we must continue to carry forward the spirit of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act among workers and masses, and do everything possible to use old materials, waste materials, and substitutes. However, when using substitutes, they must be tested before mass production. For some high-end and sophisticated products, if qualified raw materials cannot be resolved, and substitute raw materials are still being tested, and therefore cannot temporarily meet the requirements, the grade label should be changed, and consumers should be informed clearly. The commercial departments also have the responsibility to urge and assist the industrial departments to improve product quality, control the acceptance checkpoint, and prevent inferior products from entering the market.

With the continuous improvement of living standards, the people's demands for quality are also getting higher and higher. People want not only durable goods, but also novel and beautiful daily necessities, not only hygienic, but also nutritious and tasty foods. Therefore, continuously striving to improve product quality, like increasing production, is our important task at any time.

### 努力提高轻工业品的质量

    努力提高轻工业品的质量
    轻工业品同人民生活关系十分密切。几年来，轻工业在发展生产的同时，对于提高产品质量作了不懈的努力，并且收到了很大效果。特别是在去年，产量有大跃进，质量也有所提高，品种花样也有所增加，不少产品还得到了国内外消费者的好评。今年以来许多产品质量继续有所改进和提高。但是也有一些企业的产品质量有所下降，例如有些凸版印刷纸单位重量过重，有的胶鞋容易开胶裂口，有的干电池放光时间缩短，有的暖瓶残损率大。虽然有些残损产品没有流入市场，但这种情况却给国家造成了损失，应该引起我们重视，立即设法加以改进。
    当前一些轻工业产品的质量不够好的原因是多方面的，其中主要的是有些同志对质量和产量的关系有不正确的看法。比如有些人认为，目前人民对轻工业品的需要量很大，经常供不应求，因之必须迅速增加数量，质量差一些没有什么关系。这种只注意数量而忽视质量的想法，是不对的。当然，为了适当地满足人民生活的需要，轻工业部门应当尽最大努力增产，目前国家在这方面已经作了相应的安排，轻工业部门的全体职工也正在努力完成并且争取超额完成国家计划。但是，同时也必须了解，人们花钱买东西，总是希望买到质量合乎要求的东西，质量不合乎要求，消费者就不欢迎。在任何时期，高产都不能离开优质，特别是在目前轻工业品的增长还赶不上人民的需要的时候，抓质量就更有其积极意义。比如说，公社化以后，广大农村妇女参加了农业劳动，城市许多妇女也就了业，没空做鞋了，需要供应的鞋大大增加了，如果我们生产的胶鞋、球鞋、皮鞋、布鞋坚固耐牢，穿着时间比过去延长三分之一，从使用价值来看，就等于全年增产30％。相反的，如果质量不好，穿着时间比过去缩短三分之一，那实际上就等于减产30％。很显然，这不但要加重消费者负担，而且更加重市场的供应任务。“提高质量就是增加数量”，从这里看是再明显不过了。
    也有些人觉得，目前轻工业原料、材料供应不富裕，节约是首要任务，如果强调了质量，有些产品就势必要多耗用一些原材料，因此，为了节约原料、材料，质量差些也没有关系。这种看法也显然是不对的。不错，勤俭建国是我国社会主义建设的方针。任何时候，我们都要注意节约，反对浪费。但是，必须是在保证质量的前提下的节约才是合理的有实际意义的，否则就是得不偿失的。为了节约原料和材料而降低产品质量，表面看来似乎是节约了，但是产品质量不好，容易损坏，却是极大的浪费。况且质量好的产品不一定要比质量差的产品多耗用原料、材料。有时多用了原料，产品质量反而下降。以凸版印刷纸来说，每一平方公尺重五十二克，质量是优等的，要是多用了纸浆，重量达到六十克以上，纸张就会太厚，质量反而降低了。这个事实明显地说明，提高产品质量，不一定需要增加原材料的使用量。当然，有的产品，由于过去不适当地节约原料、材料，致使质量下降，现在为了保证质量，需要增加一些原料、材料。但是，这种增加是必要的、合理的，不能叫做浪费原料材料。而过去的所谓“节约”，则是不合理的。
    还有的同志说，目前有些轻工业品的原料材料的质量不好，不能生产出质量较好的产品来。不可否认，产品的质量在很大程度上取决于原料的质量，但不能说这是决定产品质量的唯一因素。这当中还要看人们的主观努力如何。如果人们的主观努力不够，有了好原材料，也往往生产不出质量好的产品。相反的，如果认识到提高产品质量的重要性，努力采取各种措施，用比较次的原材料也可以生产出优质产品来。最近，上海金刚橡胶厂用低级胶做出优质球鞋就是一个最生动的说明。这个厂从第一季开始，用来做球鞋的优质烟片胶供应不足，不得不全部使用质量较差的绉片胶。这种胶杂质多，耐磨性能差，当时就有人担心球鞋的质量会下降。但这个厂的党组织认为：只要充分发动群众，发扬群众的集体智慧，用绉片胶做出优质球鞋是有可能的。他们依靠群众想办法，摸索出了用低级胶做出优质球鞋的配方和操作方法，并且建立一系列的检验制度。就这样，在4月份虽然全部使用绉片胶，但球鞋的耐磨性能比第一季生产的产品大大增强，基本上达到了优质胶制品的规格。
    很明显，要提高产品质量，就必须先从端正认识入手。解决了思想问题之后，还要采取一系列的有效的具体措施。在目前开展的增产节约运动中，各级领导干部必须重视提高质量问题，同时要大张旗鼓地向职工群众讲清提高质量的重要意义，进行一次优质高产的教育，开展群众性的质量检查。现有的大中型的现代化企业，要着重发动群众结合本企业的质量要求，修订和补立一些必要技术管理和质量检验等制度。新投入生产的大型企业，则要着重提高新工人的技术水平，建立必要的技术和质量管理制度。在土洋结合的各种小型企业，则着重提高生产技术，过好技术关。已经发生质量不好的企业，必须运用算细帐、讲道理、举办质量展览会以及直接访问消费者等形式发动群众，猛攻质量关，以达到如期改进。对于提高质量有成绩的企业、车间、个人，必须及时总结他们的经验，树立先进的标兵，推广他们的经验。
    目前，在轻工业品的原料材料不能满足增产的需要的情况下，必须继续发扬职工群众的敢想敢说敢做的精神，千方百计地使用旧料、废料，使用代用品。但是，在采用代用品的时候，必须经过试验，再进行成批生产。对于某些高级的、精密的产品，确实由于合格的原料材料不能解决，代用的原材料尚在试验，因而暂时达不到要求的，应该改换等级牌号，向消费者讲清楚。商业部门也有责任督促和协助工业部门提高产品质量，把住验收关口，不让劣质产品流入市场。
    随着生活水平的不断提高，人民群众对质量的要求也就越来越高。人们不但要经久耐用的，而且要式样新颖美观的日用品，不仅要合乎卫生的，而且要有营养、味道好的各种食品。因此，不断地努力提高产品质量，跟提高产量一样，任何时候，都是我们的重要任务。
