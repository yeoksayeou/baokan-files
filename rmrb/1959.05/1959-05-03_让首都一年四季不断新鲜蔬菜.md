Comrade Chairman, fellow representatives:

    I fully endorse the reports of Premier Zhou, Vice Premier Li Fuchun, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, and Vice Chairman and Secretary-General Peng Zhen.

    A few days ago, the members of our Huangtugang People's Commune heard Premier Zhou's Government Work Report on the radio. During the discussion, everyone said in unison, "Every sentence speaks to the hearts of us farmers. Last year's Great Leap Forward saw Huangtugang recognized as a national advanced unit in agricultural socialist construction. This year, we must work even harder and continue the Great Leap Forward, determined not to fall behind." This is the unanimous determination of our commune and the unanimous determination of the farmers in the suburbs of Beijing.

    To be honest, Premier Zhou's report expressed what was in the hearts of the commune members. The situation in our commune alone is enough to prove the great achievements of the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production and the realization of people's communes in 1958.

    Our Huangtugang Commune, a commune in the suburbs of Beijing mainly producing vegetables, has more than 17,300 households and over 83,000 people, including 6,100 farming households with more than 26,000 people, cultivating over 56,000 mu of land. In 1958, we listened to the Party and Chairman Mao, vigorously developed water conservancy, basically achieved water conservancy, accumulated fertilizer, deeply plowed the land, earnestly followed the "Eight-Point Charter" for agriculture, and went all out to strive for the Great Leap Forward. When we tallied the accounts after the autumn harvest, the harvest of that year was simply beyond our dreams; the older generation of commune members said they had never seen anything like it. That year, our grain yield averaged 784 jin per mu, an increase of 75.2 percent compared to the previous year. The vegetables in the commune also had a bumper harvest. The 44,000 mu of vegetable fields produced over 134.4 million jin, an increase of more than 50 percent compared to the previous year. Although the development of our vegetable production, especially the development of Chinese cabbage, still cannot keep up with the needs of the capital, the number of vegetables has increased to 72 varieties, with fresh vegetables available throughout the year, laying the foundation for the great development of vegetable production this year. Not only agriculture, but the commune's sideline occupations and industries have also developed greatly. In total, the total income of the commune was more than 6.73 million yuan, an increase of 12 percent compared to the previous year, and the income of each commune member's household also increased from 471 yuan in the previous year to 486 yuan. After the autumn distribution, everyone was happy, and the accountants were dumbfounded. In the face of the unprecedented increase in production and bumper harvest, everyone realized the benefits of the Great Leap Forward, and everyone was full of confidence in continuing the Great Leap Forward this year.

    After the merger of Fengtai Town and the four nearby agricultural production cooperatives into a people's commune in August last year, the strength for production became even greater, and people's enthusiasm became even higher. The first thing everyone praised was that the commune implemented a food supply system, giving farmers an iron rice bowl. In addition, the commune established nurseries and homes for the elderly, with more than 5,000 children enrolled in nurseries and toddler teams. The old and young were taken care of, and the entire commune organized 19 sewing groups to sew clothes for the commune members. More than 3,000 female laborers no longer revolved around the cooking stove, millstone, and kang, but went out to participate in labor, adding a new force to agricultural production.

    People are refreshed by happy events. The establishment of the commune and the bumper harvest made production in the autumn, winter, and spring of last year very different from previous years. All 6,230 mu of wheat in the commune were planted on deeply plowed land last year at the tail end of White Dew and the beginning of the Autumn Equinox, using more than 30 jin of seeds, and watered with freezing water, reviving water, and jointing water; basal fertilizer, reviving fertilizer, and jointing fertilizer were applied. The wheat seedlings are dense and robust. As long as management is strengthened and no unexpected disasters are encountered, the wheat will definitely have a bumper harvest. Taking the main vegetable production of the commune as an example, the commune members have even greater ambitions and more enthusiasm for continuing the leap forward. This year, the area for planting vegetables in the entire commune will be expanded to more than 53,000 mu, an increase of more than 10,000 mu compared to last year, and 210 million jin of vegetables will be produced, an increase of more than 30 percent compared to last year. To realize this plan, the production teams enlarged the ditches and added irrigation and drainage machinery to ensure that all vegetable fields could be watered in a timely manner. 30,000 jin of basal fertilizer per mu have been accumulated, which is more in quantity and better in quality compared to last year; and all vegetable seeds have basically realized improved varieties, such as Chinese cabbage, which are all Daqingkou and Qingbaikou varieties, eliminating the small and short Anxi Dun varieties, and sufficient pesticides have also been prepared to prevent pests and diseases. Everyone is wholeheartedly striving for a greater bumper harvest of vegetable production. After the vegetable seeds were planted, we recently encountered three cold waves. On the evening of April 16th, the entire commune mobilized more than 11,000 people to prevent frost and freezing, covering more than 9,000 mu of potatoes with soil. For vegetables that could not be covered with soil, smoke was fumigated at the edge of the fields, or mats were used, so that the vegetable seedlings were basically not damaged.

    All these things show the enthusiasm and confidence of all commune members in striving for a greater leap forward this year on the basis of the Great Leap Forward in 1958 and the realization of communization. Some imperialist elements, like Dulles and his ilk, slander that our Great Leap Forward has no achievements and that the people's communes are messed up. We will use these facts to slap them in the face hard. Those who open their eyes and tell lies are actually afraid of our people's communes, because although the people's communes have only been established for more than half a year, they have already taken root in the hearts of the commune members. The commune members have already seen that as long as they listen to the Party and Chairman Mao, and strive to achieve a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward, and successfully overfulfill the Second Five-Year Plan, the people's communes will bring more benefits to us farmers.

    When the people's commune was first established, everyone had no experience. These days, in the work of rectifying and consolidating the people's commune, we are summing up experience, improving our work, earnestly implementing the system of "unified leadership, decentralized management," implementing the method of "three guarantees and one reward," giving full play to the enthusiasm of the production teams and all commune members, and, within the entire commune, we are launching a production increase and economy campaign centered on improving agricultural tools and improving work efficiency, earnestly managing wheat and vegetables, seizing the season to sow in a timely manner, and doing a good job in diversified operations, striving to produce 210 million jin of vegetables and achieve a grain yield of 1,000 jin per mu for the whole year. All our commune members have soaring enthusiasm and full confidence. We believe that under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, with the rich experience of the Great Leap Forward in 1958, and with the people's communes, we will definitely be able to, together with the farmer brothers across the country and the worker comrades across the country, complete and overfulfill the 1959 national economic plan, and use the facts of a greater leap forward to show the revolutionary ambition and great strength of the Chinese people to the world.

### 让首都一年四季不断新鲜蔬菜

    让首都一年四季不断新鲜蔬菜
    殷维臣代表的发言主席、各位代表：
    我完全拥护周总理、李富春副总理、李先念副总理和彭真副委员长兼秘书长的报告。
    前些天，我们黄土岗人民公社的社员们从广播里听到了周总理的政府工作报告，大伙在讨论报告的时候，都异口同声地说：“真是句句都说在咱们农民的心坎上，去年生产大跃进，黄土岗评上了全国农业社会主义建设先进单位，今年，咱们更要加足了劲干，继续大跃进，决不能落在后边。”这是我们公社上下一致的决心，也是北京郊区农民一致的决心。
  说真的，周总理的报告将社员心里的话都说出来了。就拿我们一个公社的情况来说，就足以证明一九五八年农业生产大跃进和实现人民公社化的伟大成绩。
    我们黄土岗公社，是北京郊区一个以出产蔬菜为主的公社，一万七千三百多户，八万三千多人，其中农户6100户26000多人有五万六千多亩地。一九五八年，我们听了党的话，听了毛主席的话，大兴水利，基本上实现了水利化，积攒肥料、深翻土地，认真地按照农业“八字宪法”办事，鼓足了干劲，争取大跃进。到秋后一算账，这一年的收成简直是做梦也想不到，老一辈的社员都说没见过。这一年，我们的粮食平均每亩打了七百八十四斤，比前年增加了百分之七十五点二。社里的蔬菜，也是大丰收，四万四千亩菜，出产了一亿三千四百多万斤，比前年增加了百分之五十还多。虽然我们蔬菜生产的发展，特别是大白菜的发展，还赶不上首都的需要，但是，蔬菜已经增加到七十二种，一年四季都断不了鲜菜，给今年的蔬菜生产大发展扎下了根基。不光农业，社里的副业和工业也有了很大的发展。总算起来，全社总收入六百七十三万多元，比前年增加了百分之十二，每户社员的收入也从前年的四百七十一元，增加到四百八十六元。秋后一分红，大伙高兴了，算账派傻眼了，在空前增产丰收的事实面前，人人都觉出了大跃进的好处，人人都对今年继续大跃进信心百倍。
    去年八月，丰台镇和附近的四个农业生产合作社合并建成人民公社以后，搞生产的力量更大了，人们的劲头也更足了。人人称道的头一条，就是公社实行了伙食供给制，农民有了铁饭碗，再加上公社成立了托儿所、敬老院，五千多个儿童入了托儿所、幼儿队，老小都有人照顾，全公社又组织了十九个缝纫组给社员缝衣裳，三千多妇女劳动力都不再围着锅台、碾台、炕台转了，出门参加了劳动，给农业生产添了一支生力军。
    人逢喜事精神爽，成立公社又是大丰收，去年秋天、冬天和今年春天的生产就搞得与往年大不相同。全公社六千二百三十亩小麦，去年都在白露尾秋分头种在深翻过的土地上，使了三十多斤种，浇了封冻水、返青水、拔节水；施了底肥、返青肥、拔节肥，麦苗茂密粗壮，只要加强管理，不遇到意外的灾害，小麦一定能够大丰收。再拿社里主要出产的蔬菜来说，社员们继续跃进的雄心更大、干劲更足。今年，全公社种植蔬菜的面积要扩大到五万三千多亩，比去年增加一万余亩，要生产蔬菜二亿一千万斤，比去年增加百分之三十多。为了实现这个计划，生产队里整大了沟渠，增添了排灌机械，能够保证全部菜地适时灌水；每亩地的底肥已经积攒到三万斤，和去年比较，量多质好；并且所有的菜籽都基本上实现了良种化，如大白菜都是大青口、青白口品种，淘汰了小棵、矮棵的安西墩种，也准备了足够的农药预防病虫害。大家都一心一意要争取蔬菜生产的更大丰收。菜种上以后，最近遇到三次寒潮，四月十六日晚上，全公社出动了一万一千多人防霜防冻，将九千多亩土豆都盖上了土，对盖不上土的菜就在地头上沤烟，或是用席苫，使菜苗基本没有受到损失。
    所有这些事情，都表示出在一九五八年的大跃进和实现公社化的基础上，全体社员为争取今年更大跃进的干劲和信心。有些帝国主义分子，像杜勒斯之流，诬蔑我们大跃进没有成绩，说人民公社搞糟了，我们就用这些事实来狠狠地打他们几个大嘴巴。睁着眼睛说瞎话的人，实际上是害怕我们的人民公社，因为人民公社虽然才成立半年多，就已经在社员心里扎下了根，社员们都已经看到，只要听党的话，听毛主席的话，努力实现更大更好更全面的跃进，胜利地超额完成第二个五年计划，人民公社就会给我们农民带来更多的好处。
    人民公社初成立，大家都没有经验，这些日子我们在整顿和巩固人民公社的工作中，正在总结经验，改进工作，认真地实行了“统一领导、分级管理”的制度，实行了“三包一奖”的办法，充分发挥了生产队和全体社员的积极性，并且，我们在全社范围内正在开展一个以改良农具、提高工作效率为中心的增产节约运动，认真管好小麦、管好蔬菜，抓紧季节适时春播，搞好多种经营，为争取全年生产蔬菜二亿一千万斤，粮食亩产千斤而努力。我们全体公社社员都有冲天的干劲和十足的信心。我们相信，在中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导下，有了一九五八年大跃进的丰富经验，有了人民公社，我们一定能够和全国农民兄弟一道，和全国的工人同志们一道，完成和超额完成一九五九年的国民经济计划，用更大跃进的事实，来向全世界表明中国人民的革命志气和伟大的力量。
