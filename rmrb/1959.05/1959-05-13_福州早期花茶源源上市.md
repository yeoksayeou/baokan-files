Fuzhou Early Season Scented Tea Enters the Market in a Steady Stream

    (Reported by this newspaper) The first batch of early season scented tea, totaling more than 5,400 cases, produced by the Fuzhou Tea Factory has been shipped in a steady stream to Beijing, Shenyang, Changchun, Xi'an, and other places to meet market demand. Fuzhou is an important scented tea production base in China. This year, the output of scented tea from the Fuzhou Tea Factory will account for approximately 35% of the national scented tea output. The main varieties of Fuzhou scented tea include jasmine tea, rose tea, magnolia tea, pomelo flower tea, and dozens of others, sold in twenty-five provinces and cities across the country, as well as exported to Hong Kong and Southeast Asian countries.

    The early season scented tea currently being shipped to various locations is made from tea stock left over from last year and freshly available pomelo flowers and bitter orange flowers. This year, the Fuzhou area experienced an early warm season, resulting in exceptionally high-quality fragrant flowers. Consequently, the scented tea produced is very fragrant, and the brewed tea is clear and bright. The tea factory workers expressed their determination to achieve mechanization in scented tea production during this year's vigorous technical innovation campaign, striving to process 135,000 dan of various types of tea throughout the year, representing a 35% increase in output compared to last year.

    福州早期花茶源源上市
    本报讯  福州茶厂生产的首批早期花茶五千四百多箱已经源源运往北京、沈阳、长春、西安等地，供应市场需要。福州是我国重要的花茶生产基地。今年福州茶厂的花茶产量，将占全国花茶产量的35％左右。福州花茶的主要品种有：茉莉花茶、玫瑰花茶、玉兰花茶、柚子花茶等几十种，销行全国二十五个省市，并远销香港及东南亚各国。
    目前运往各地的早期花茶，是采用去年留下的茶胚原料和今年新上市的柚子花和玳玳花等混合烘制成的。今年福州地区气候早暖，香花品质格外优良，因而制出的花茶十分馥郁，泡水清碧明净。茶厂工人们表示要在今年大闹技术革新中，实现花茶生产机械化，力争全年加工各类茶叶十三万五千担，比去年产量增加35％。  （林琪华、李锦章）
