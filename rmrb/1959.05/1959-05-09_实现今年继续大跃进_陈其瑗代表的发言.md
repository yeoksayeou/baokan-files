　　I fully endorse Premier Zhou's Government Work Report, Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the Draft National Economic Plan for 1959, Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1958 National Financial Statement and the 1959 Draft National Budget, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen's report on the work of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and Vice Chairman Li Weihan's report on the work of the Standing Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) at the First Plenary Session of the Third CPPCC.

　　These reports fully reflect the great leap forward and great unity in our country since 1958, embody the heroic spirit of our people in realizing a greater leap forward in 1959 and the firm will to safeguard national unity and the unity of the whole people, and point out the concrete path for the people of the whole country to continue to maintain the leap forward and unity in the future. These reports are documents of great significance. We must pass them and study them carefully, and implement the spirit of the reports in all our work. Now, please allow me to express my initial understanding after listening to Premier Zhou's report and my views on the Tibetan rebellion.

　　The unprecedented great leap forward of the national economy was realized in 1958, and iron-clad facts refuted the slander of imperialism

　　In 1958, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the people of our country implemented the general line of socialist construction and realized an unprecedented great leap forward in the national economy. In 1958 alone, the total output value of industry and agriculture increased by 65 percent compared with 1957, and the main industrial and agricultural products such as steel, coal, grain, and cotton more than doubled compared with 1957. Great leaps forward have also occurred in transportation, culture, education, and other aspects.

　　In the great leap forward of 1958, more than 26,000 large-scale people's communes integrating industry, agriculture, commerce, education, and military affairs, and combining government administration and commune management, were established in rural areas across the country according to the demands of the broad masses of peasants. Practice over the past six months has fully proved that the people's commune is the best form to promote the continued development of productive forces and accelerate socialist construction, and it is also the best form for the future transition from socialist collective ownership to ownership by the whole people, and from socialist society to communist society in the entire countryside.

　　The speed of economic development in our country is absolutely impossible to achieve in the capitalist world. Facing the brilliant achievements of our economic construction and the people's communes in rural areas, the imperialists, especially the American imperialists, were initially doubtful, then panicked, and finally had to resort to their old tricks of distorting and fabricating rumors, and wantonly slandered and clamored against our country. We must answer them with iron-clad facts. Not only did we make a great leap forward in 1958, but we will make an even greater leap forward in 1959, and we will continue to leap forward year after year. Now, we are about to discuss and approve the National Economic Plan for 1959, which is a magnificent leap forward plan. The four major production targets for steel, coal, grain, and cotton stipulated in the plan are all about three times the actual output in 1957. It is certain that under the guidance of the Party's general line for building socialism, on the basis of the rich experience of the great leap forward in 1958, and continuing to implement a complete set of policies of "walking on two legs," the policy of "the whole country as a coordinated chessboard," and the policy of "combining centralized leadership with vigorous mass movements," the people of our country will launch a large-scale campaign to increase production and practice economy centered on technological innovation and technological revolution. We will be able to overcome all difficulties, complete and overfulfill the 1959 National Economic Plan, and lay a further foundation for striving to rapidly build our country into a socialist country with highly developed modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture. We will leap forward again and again, and let the imperialists and all reactionaries in the world tremble in the face of the superiority of socialism and its great vitality!

　　After our people won the socialist revolution on the economic front in 1956, the private ownership of the means of production by capitalists has been basically transformed into ownership by the whole people, the system of exploitation has been eliminated in our country, the mutual relations between people in labor have been greatly changed, and a comrade-like relationship of mutual assistance and cooperation has begun to be established, which has strengthened the unity within the people. In particular, the all-people rectification movement and the anti-rightist struggle carried out in 1957 and the first half of 1958 achieved a great victory in the socialist revolution on the ideological and political fronts. The policy of correctly handling contradictions among the people put forward by Chairman Mao was gradually implemented, people's democracy was greatly developed, and the political consciousness of the broad masses of cadres and people was greatly improved. The true comrade-like relationship of mutual assistance and cooperation among people has developed more smoothly, greatly enhancing the unity within the people, and first of all, strengthening the unity between workers and peasants.

　　Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, an unprecedented great unity of the whole people in the thousands of years of Chinese history has emerged.

　　On the basis of further consolidating the worker-peasant alliance, a new relationship of unity and cooperation has emerged between the Party and non-Party masses, between cadres and the masses, between leaders and the led, between the central government and local governments, between all parts of the country, between the Han nationality and minority nationalities, and between all nationalities in the country. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, an unprecedented great unity of the whole people has emerged in the thousands of years of Chinese history. This unprecedented situation of great unity of the whole people has greatly consolidated the unity of the country politically; in economic construction, it is significantly manifested in the fact that the 600 million people of the whole country, all regions of the country, and all departments of the national economy are combined into a unified and organic whole, "the whole country as a coordinated chessboard," and individuals, localities, and departments all proceed from the interests of the whole, do everything possible to ensure the realization of the national plan, and make the greatest contribution to the victory of the whole. At the same time, under unified leadership and the guidance of the national plan, they fully exert their own initiative.

　　The practice of 1958 proves that the great unity of the whole people, which embodies the superiority of socialist relations of production, promotes the leap forward of productive forces; and the continuous leap forward of the socialist cause will inevitably continuously strengthen the unity of the people of the whole country and continuously consolidate the unity of the country. The situation of "disunity" and "a heap of loose sand" in old China is long gone. The unity rooted in the superior socialist system is unbreakable and cannot be destroyed by any force. This kind of unity is forever impossible to appear within any capitalist country. Although the imperialists extremely hate the unity of the people of all ethnic groups in our country and the unity of the country, and try every means to undermine it, this is a futile attempt and will inevitably be met with a shameful defeat. The recent Tibetan rebellion is a clear example.

　　The Tibetan rebellion has promoted the greater unity of the motherland and the greater unity between the Han and Tibetan people, and promoted the rebirth of Tibet

　　Obviously, the Tibetan rebels and their supporters—the imperialists, foreign reactionaries, and the Chiang Kai-shek clique—misjudged the situation. They thought that launching a rebellion could achieve the goal of splitting the motherland and causing Tibet to regress. However, contrary to their wishes, their rebellion has promoted the greater unity of the motherland and the greater unity between the Han and Tibetan nationalities, and has promoted the rebirth of Tibet. After the suppression of this rebellion, a new page is unfolding in the history of Tibet, and the Tibetan people's desire for democratic reform and social progress will be realized more quickly. This is a great victory for our country's policy of ethnic unity, and it is also another shameful failure of the imperialists' consistent attempts to disintegrate our country's unity and undermine the unity of our various ethnic groups.

　　I fully support the government's policy of thoroughly handling the Tibetan rebellion and Premier Zhou's solemn position and analysis of the Tibetan rebellion in his Government Work Report. Many delegates and Xinhua News Agency political reporters have also made forceful exposures and rebuttals to the imperialists and foreign reactionaries' slander against our government after the Tibetan rebellion, and to the so-called "Dalai Lama's statement." I want to emphasize here that the actions of the imperialists and foreign reactionaries in supporting the Tibetan rebels and all their slanders and clamors fully expose their despicable conspiracy to make the Tibetan people lose the leadership of the motherland, so that they can cruelly exploit and enslave the Tibetan people. The so-called "destruction of the agreement on the peaceful liberation of Tibet," "destruction of Tibetan autonomy," "destruction of religious and political freedom," etc., by our government are just smoke screens created to cover up this despicable conspiracy, and are absolutely not religious issues or ethnic issues.

　　We want to warn the imperialists and foreign reactionaries that the era when the Chinese people, including the Tibetan people, were at the mercy of others is long gone. Any conspiracy to split Tibet from the big family of the motherland will be met with the due response of the Chinese people. Tibet is Chinese territory, and the suppression of the Tibetan rebellion is entirely China's internal affair. No foreign country shall interfere in the Tibetan rebellion, which is purely China's internal affair.

　　China and India have a long history of friendly relations, and they are also the countries that jointly initiated the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. We hope that our well-intentioned Indian friends who have repeatedly emphasized their sympathy for the Tibetan people can place their sympathy on the side of the 1.1 million Tibetan working people. We hope that our well-intentioned Indian friends can recognize the imperialists and reactionaries' conspiracy to use the Tibetan rebellion to undermine the friendly relations between China and India, and take wise steps to further strengthen the friendly relations between China and India, especially to take steps to help the Dalai Lama get rid of his kidnapped situation and return to the motherland as soon as possible. This is what friends should do, and only in this way can it be in the interests of the people of China and India.

　　实现今年继续大跃进
    陈其瑗代表的发言
    我完全拥护周总理的政府工作报告、李富春副总理关于一九五九年国民经济计划草案的报告、李先念副总理关于一九五八年国家决算和一九五九年国家预算草案的报告、彭真副委员长关于人大常务委员会工作的报告及李维汉副主席在政协三届一次全体委员会议上关于政协常务委员会工作的报告。
    这几个报告充分地反映了一九五八年以来我国的大跃进、大团结的面貌，体现了我国人民为实现一九五九年更大跃进的英雄气概和维护国家统一和全民大团结的坚决意志，并且指出了全国人民今后继续保持跃进和团结的具体的道路。这些报告是具有重大意义的文件，我们必须通过并认真学习，把报告的精神贯彻到我们各项工作当中去。现在，请让我把听了周总理报告后的初步体会和对西藏叛乱事件的意见发表如下：
    一九五八年实现了国民经济的空前伟大的跃进，铁一般的事实回击了帝国主义的污蔑
    一九五八年，我国人民在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，贯彻执行了社会主义建设的总路线，实现了国民经济的空前伟大的跃进。一九五八年一年当中，工农业总产值比一九五七年增长了百分之六十五，钢、煤、粮、棉等主要的工农业产品都比一九五七年增长了一倍以上，在交通运输、文化教育等各个方面也都出现了巨大的跃进。
    在一九五八年的大跃进中，全国农村根据广大农民的要求，建立了二万六千多个大规模的、工农商学兵相结合的、政社合一的人民公社。大半年来的实践充分证明：人民公社是推动生产力继续向前发展，加速社会主义建设的最好形式，也是将来全国农村从社会主义集体所有制过渡到全民所有制，从社会主义社会过渡到共产主义社会的最好形式。
    我国的经济发展速度，在资本主义世界是绝对不可能实现的。帝国主义者特别是美帝国主义者面对着我们经济建设的辉煌成就和农村的人民公社化，始则怀疑，继则惊慌，最后只好无可奈何地拿出歪曲造谣的看家本领，对我国大肆污蔑叫嚣。我们要用铁一般的事实回答他们。我们不但在一九五八年大跃进，在一九五九年还要更大地跃进，以后我们还将年年不断跃进。现在，我们即将讨论通过一九五九年的国民经济计划，这是一个宏伟的跃进计划，计划规定的钢、煤、粮、棉四大生产指标，都等于一九五七年实际产量的三倍左右。可以肯定，我国人民在党的建设社会主义总路线的指引下，在一九五八年大跃进丰富经验的基础上，继续贯彻一整套“两条腿走路”的方针，“全国一盘棋”的方针和“集中领导同大搞群众运动相结合”的方针，大规模地开展以技术革新和技术革命为中心的增产节约运动，就一定能够克服一切困难，完成和超额完成一九五九年的国民经济计划，为争取迅速把我国建设成为具有高度发展的现代工业、现代农业和现代科学文化的社会主义国家，打下进一步的基础。我们将跃进再跃进，让全世界帝国主义和一切反动派在社会主义的优越性和它的伟大生命力面前发抖吧！
    一九五六年我国人民在经济战线上取得了社会主义革命胜利后，资本家的生产资料私有制已经基本转变为全民所有制，剥削制度已经在我国消灭，人们在劳动中的相互关系就大大改变了，开始建立起一种同志式的互助合作关系，加强了人民内部的团结。特别是一九五七年和一九五八年上半年进行了全民整风运动和反右派斗争，在思想战线和政治战线上取得了社会主义革命的伟大胜利，毛主席所提出的正确处理人民内部矛盾的方针逐步贯彻执行，人民民主有了重大发展，广大干部和群众的政治觉悟大大提高，人与人之间的真正同志式的互助合作关系更加顺利地发展起来，大大增强了人民内部的团结，首先是加强了工人和农民之间的团结。
    在中国共产党和毛主席领导下，出现了中国数千年史无前例的全民大团结
    在工农联盟进一步巩固的基础上，党与非党群众之间、干部与群众之间、领导者与被领导者之间、中央与地方之间、全国各地之间、汉族与少数民族之间、全国各民族之间，出现了新的团结协作的关系，在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，出现了中国数千年历史上从来没有的全民大团结。这种空前的全民大团结的局面，在政治上大大地巩固了国家的统一；在经济建设上，显著地表现在全国六亿人民、全国各地区、国民经济的各部门，结合成一个统一的有机的整体，“全国一盘棋”，个人、局部、部门都从整体的利益出发，尽一切力量保证国家计划的实现，为整体的胜利作出最大的贡献，同时，又在统一领导下和国家计划指导下充分发挥自己的积极性。
    一九五八年的实践证明，体现社会主义生产关系优越性的全民大团结，促进了生产力的跃进；而社会主义事业的不断跃进，又必然要不断加强全国人民的团结，不断巩固国家的统一。旧中国的“四分五裂”、“一盘散沙”的局面早已一去不复返了。植根于优越的社会主义制度的团结和统一是牢不可破的，是没有任何力量可以摧毁的。这种团结和统一是任何资本主义国家内部永远不可能出现的。尽管帝国主义者极端仇视我国各族人民的团结和国家的统一，并千方百计加以破坏，但这是枉费心机，必然要遭到可耻失败的。最近西藏叛乱事件便是一个明显的例证。
    西藏的叛乱促成了祖国的更加统一和汉藏人民之间的更加团结，促成了西藏的新生
    显然，西藏的叛乱分子和他们的支持者——帝国主义者、外国反动派和蒋介石集团，把形势估计错了。他们以为发动起叛乱就可以达到分裂祖国和使西藏倒退的目的。但是，恰恰和他们的愿望相反，他们的叛乱行动却促成了祖国的更加统一和汉藏民族之间的更加团结，促成了西藏的新生。经过这次叛乱的平定，西藏的历史正在展开新的一页，西藏人民对于民主改革和社会进步的愿望，将会更快的实现。这是我国民族团结政策的一个伟大胜利，也是帝国主义一贯企图瓦解我国的统一和破坏我国各民族团结的又一次可耻的失败。
    我完全拥护政府彻底处理西藏叛乱事件的政策和周总理在政府工作报告中对西藏叛乱事件所持的严正立场和所作的分析。对于帝国主义者和外国反动派在西藏叛乱事件后所发出的对我国政府的污蔑，以及所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”，许多代表和新华社政治记者也作了有力的揭露和驳斥。我在这里要着重指出，帝国主义者和外国反动派支持西藏的叛乱分子的行动和他们所有的污蔑叫嚣，完全暴露了他们企图使西藏人民失去祖国的领导，以便他们对西藏人民进行残酷的剥削和奴役的卑鄙阴谋。所谓我国政府“破坏关于和平解放西藏办法的协议”、“破坏西藏自治”、“摧毁宗教和政治自由”等等，不过是为了掩盖这种卑鄙阴谋而制造出来的烟幕而已，绝对不是什么宗教问题，也不是什么民族问题。
    我们要警告帝国主义者和外国反动派，中国人民包括西藏人民任人宰割奴役的时代早已过去了。任何企图把西藏从祖国大家庭中分裂出去的阴谋都将遭到中国人民应有的回击。西藏是中国的领土，西藏叛乱的平定完全是中国的内政，任何外国都不得干涉纯属中国内政的西藏叛乱事件。
    中印两国有长期友好关系的历史，又是共同首倡和平共处五项原则的国家，我们希望一再强调同情西藏人的印度好心朋友能够把他们的同情放在一百一十几万西藏劳动人民这一边，我们希望印度的好心朋友能够认识帝国主义者和反动分子企图利用西藏叛乱事件破坏中印友好关系的阴谋诡计，采取明智的进一步加强中印友好关系的步骤，特别是采取步骤帮助达赖喇嘛摆脱被劫持的境地，早日回到祖国来，这才是够朋友的表现，也只有这样才符合中印两国人民的利益。
