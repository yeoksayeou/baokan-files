　　Having returned from a meeting at the brigade headquarters, it was already late at night. As soon as Zhang Anjun, the Miao youth rapid response team leader, got back to Guanping Mountain Village, he immediately prepared to call a meeting of the rapid response team members. The young men had all gone to the mountain to transport fertilizer. Zhang Anjun walked along an alley in the village leading to the mountain. At the entrance of the village, he ran into team members carrying manure. The young men, seeing the team leader return, immediately surrounded him, all waiting to throw themselves into a new battle.

　　With a vigorous leap, Zhang Anjun jumped onto a low wall made of stones and excitedly said, "Comrades, for this year's bumper harvest, the Party Committee has decided that the more than one hundred mu of barren land near Huangshadong will receive 1,000 dan of concentrated fertilizer per mu. This task will be completed by our rapid response team through a concentrated effort." The young men listened quietly, their faces revealing an irrepressible excitement.

　　But where would so much concentrated fertilizer come from! Even if there were that much, more than one hundred thousand dan of fertilizer, crossing mountains and valleys, would take all the labor force of Guanping Miao Village at least two or three months to transport.

　　The next day, Zhang Anjun—this Miao youth who was only twenty-one years old—led his rapid response team to Huangshadong to set up camp. However, near this paddy field, apart from the densely growing reeds that could be burned for ash, there were no other sources of fertilizer at all.

　　What to do? One morning, he and several team members sat together discussing what to do next. They suddenly thought of that gloomy forbidden forest on the peak of Huangshadong, and determined that there must be rotten black sludge inside. However, the elders often earnestly warned: there are mountain ghosts up there, ten who go in, nine die. Zhang Anjun knew that there were no mountain ghosts. Since liberation, he had learned many scientific truths and was no longer someone who believed in ghosts. However, climbing that steep peak with cliffs on three sides was really not easy!

　　Zhang Anjun came from a poor peasant family. His parents worked as long-term laborers and contract workers, three hundred and sixty days a year, scorched in the sun and drenched in the rain, and in the end, the whole family ate wild vegetables, grass roots, and tree leaves. The painful life of the old society left the deepest mark on his heart. Now, his family has enough to eat and wear, and he has also joined the Communist Youth League and serves as the secretary of the Guanping Youth League branch. Therefore, no matter how great the difficulties today, even if the sky falls, he believes that he can withstand it! He waved his fist and said with a smile to his comrades, "In order to solve the fertilizer source, in order to dispel the elders' superstitious beliefs in ghosts and gods, we must conquer 'Ghost Mountain'!"

　　After eating breakfast, Zhang Anjun conducted a pre-mountain inspection of the several strong young rapid response team members he had selected to climb "Ghost Mountain." Before departure, each of them had their waists tightly wrapped with cloth, hung with machetes, and their feet, wearing palm-fiber rope sandals, had their trouser legs rolled up over their knees, each one energetic, just like armed soldiers ready to go.

　　The climb began. According to the terrain, they could only climb up from the mountain ridge, like a nose bridge, formed by the cliffs on the left and right sides. Zhang Anjun took big strides and was the first to climb straight up the vines. At first, they climbed very quickly. From the shaking of the reeds and mountain bamboo, one could tell where they had reached. But when they finished climbing this steep slope of densely growing bamboo and vines, and appeared on the cliff of the nose-like mountain ridge, they were like a group of snails crawling on a wall, sticking there and moving around, moving very, very slowly. They were seen sometimes bending down, removing loose stones, and taking a step upward; sometimes cutting down mountain bamboo and wild vines to make a lasso, hooking it on a jagged rock, and pulling it hard several times before climbing up one by one. Sometimes, they were like dragonflies, hanging on the edge of the cliff, holding wild vines, resting for a while, and then slowly tightening their grip on the cracks in the cliff to climb upwards. Climbing, climbing, they finally all climbed onto "Ghost Mountain."

　　This "Ghost Mountain," ah, no one knows how many years it has been since anyone came up here. Ancient trees tower into the sky, those that two people can embrace, those that one person can embrace, densely packed, so covering that even sunlight cannot penetrate. The ground is black and black, soft and spongy. Rotten leaves, bamboo leaves, and bird droppings are more than two feet deep, enough for the nearby fields to use for three to five years. This made them extremely happy. Zhang Anjun was especially happy. He grabbed a handful here to smell it, grabbed a handful there to taste it, and said with relish, "Good fertilizer, good fertilizer!"

　　They traversed the entire mountain top, seeing lush forests and mountain bamboo, smelling the aroma of decaying bamboo and wood and the fresh fragrance of young leaves. This is not "Ghost Mountain," but a treasure mountain!

　　But how to transport the fertilizer down the mountain? Slide it down? Hundreds of zhang deep valleys, once it slides down, where to collect it? Carry it? There is no road at all. The only way is to build a cableway, but on this steep cliff, where to build it from? So, they searched along the cliff for a place to build the cableway. The young men were like a flock of small birds, jumping from this cliff edge to that cliff edge, jumping and singing all the way, and finally found a place to build the cableway next to a large tree root. Now, baskets of fertilizer are flying to the fields. "Ghost Mountain" has been conquered by the Miao youth.

    踏破“鬼山”
    龙文明
    从大队部开会回来，已经是小半夜了。苗族青年速战队队长张安钧，一回到官坪山寨，就立刻准备召集速战队员开会。小伙子们都到山上运肥料去了。张安钧便顺着一条通往山上的寨巷走去。在寨头，他碰上了正在挑粪的队员。小伙子们看到队长回来，一下就把他围住了，都在等着投入新的战斗。
    张安钧用劲一跳，跳到一堵用石头砌起的矮墙上，激动地说：“伙计，为了今年的大丰收，黄沙洞附近的一百多亩瘦田，党委决定每亩施精肥一千担，这个任务由我们速战队突击完成。”小伙子们静静地听着，脸上露出难以抑制的兴奋表情。
    可是，哪来这么多精肥呀！就是有，十多万担肥，翻山越岭，官坪苗寨全部劳力出动，最少也得运两三个月。
    第二天，张安钧——这个才二十一岁的苗族青年，率领他的速战队员来到黄沙洞安营扎寨。但是，这片稻田附近除了丛生的芭茅可以烧火土灰以外，其他肥源一点也没有。
    怎么办呢？一天早晨，他同几个队员围坐着商量下一步应该如何行动。他们一下想起了黄沙洞顶峰上那片阴森森的禁林，断定里面一定有腐烂的黑污泥。可是，老人经常谆谆告诫：上面有山鬼，十个进去九个死。张安钧知道，山鬼是没有的，解放以后，他懂得了很多科学道理，已经不是一个信鬼的人了。但是，要攀登那三面悬崖的陡峰，可真是不容易啊！
    张安钧出身于贫农家庭，父母做长工，包月工，一年三百六十天，日里晒，雨里淋，到头来一家人吃野菜、草根、树叶。旧社会的痛苦生活，在他的心灵上打下了最深的烙印。如今他一家人有吃有穿，自己又参加了共青团，担任官坪团支部书记。因此，不管今天有多么大的困难，就是天塌下来，他认为自己都顶得住！他把拳头一挥，笑着对伙伴们说：“为了解决肥源，为了解除老人迷信鬼神的观念，我们要踏破‘鬼山’！”
    吃过早饭，张安钧对他挑选攀登“鬼山”的几个健壮青年速战队员进行了上山前的检查。出发前，他们每个人的腰间都用布巾捆得严严的，挂上了柴刀，穿上棕绳草鞋的脚上，裤筒卷过膝盖，一个个精神抖擞，就像武装待发的战士一样。
    登山开始了。根据山势，他们只有从左右两面悬崖构成的鼻梁似的山脊上攀上去。张安钧迈开大步，第一个攀藤直上。起初，他们上得很快，从芭茅、山竹的摇动，能看出他们已上到什么地方。但当他们攀完这段丛生竹、藤的陡坡地以后，出现在鼻梁山脊悬崖上时，却像一群蜗牛爬墙似的，贴在那里动来动去，行动很慢很慢了。只见他们一时弯下腰，撤除松石，往上蹬一步；一时又砍下山竹、野藤做成套索，搭在狼牙石上，用力拉了几下，才一个个地爬上去。有时，他们竟像蜻蜓一样，吊在悬崖嘴上，手握野藤，休息一阵，然后又慢慢地扣紧崖缝往上攀登。爬着，攀着，终于他们一个个都登上“鬼山”了。
    这“鬼山”呀，也不知道有多少年没人上来过了。古树参天，两人合抱的，一人一抱的，密密麻麻，遮盖得连阳光都透不进来。地皮，乌黑乌黑的，软绵绵的。腐烂的树叶、竹叶、鸟粪，足有二尺多深，附近的田地施用三、五年也用不完，这下可把他们乐坏了。张安钧格外高兴，他这里抓上一把嗅嗅，那里抓上一把尝尝，津津有味地说：“好肥料，好肥料！”
    他们踏遍了整个山头，看到的是丰茂的森林和山竹，嗅到的是腐烂的竹木气息和嫩叶的清香。这不是“鬼山”，而是宝山啊！
    但是肥料怎么运下山呢？往下滑吗？几百丈深谷，一滑下去，到什么地方去收呀。挑吗？根本没有路可走。唯一的办法是架索道，但在这陡峭的悬崖上，又从什么地方架呀？于是，他们又沿悬崖寻找架索道的地点。小伙子们像群小鸟似的，从这个悬崖嘴上，跳到那个悬崖嘴上，一路跳着，唱着，终于在一个大树根边找到了架索道的地方。现在，一篓篓的肥料正飞往田间。“鬼山”已被苗族小伙子们征服了。
