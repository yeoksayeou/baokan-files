Relying on the suburbs to develop production and supplying the city's needs locally is a common task for urban agricultural and commercial departments. In accordance with the spirit of the Central Government's Seven Cities, Six Provinces Non-staple Food Production and Supply Conference held in January this year, and combined with specific conditions, Chongqing has arranged this year's non-staple food production plan under the unified leadership of the Municipal Party Committee. We are determined to vigorously develop non-staple food production in the suburbs while ensuring the realization of grain production targets, and strive to achieve basic self-sufficiency in the supply of major non-staple foods within the city within one year. At the same time, we will continue to implement the policy of mutual assistance between urban and rural areas, strengthen the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas, organize and adjust more non-staple foods, and gradually meet the diverse needs of urban people.

According to the consumption level of vegetables, pork, chickens and ducks of urban residents in Chongqing in recent years (at most, each person was supplied an average of 700 jin of vegetables, 35 jin of pork, and 1.5 chickens and ducks per year), we calculated that as long as we guarantee 2 billion jin of commercial vegetables, 450,000 fattened pigs, and 2.1 million chickens and ducks on the market throughout the year, we can basically solve the supply of these three non-staple foods.

Favorable conditions for developing non-staple food production in the suburbs

There are many favorable conditions for developing non-staple food production in urban suburbs. From the specific situation in Chongqing, the main ones are: (1) Last year, three counties, Ba County, Qijiang, and Changshou, were merged into the urban area, and the suburban agricultural population increased from the original 426,000 to 2.1 million (the current urban population is 1.97 million). At present, the labor force for developing non-staple food production accounts for about 17% of the existing rural labor force (about 190,000 people), and specific arrangements have been made according to the characteristics of different regions: People's communes mainly engaged in the production of non-staple foods account for 50%-60% of the labor force; People's communes that produce both grain and non-staple foods account for 30%; People's communes mainly engaged in grain account for 10%. This arrangement can basically solve the labor needs for non-staple food production. (2) The area of cultivated land in the suburbs has also expanded from the original 565,000 mu to 3.74 million mu. This year, the vegetable cultivation area is arranged to be 300,000 mu, and each person in the city has an average of more than 6 li of vegetable land. It is possible to ensure that each person eats an average of 1.5 jin of vegetables per day in the future. Arrangements are being made for feed land. It is estimated that adding farmers' private plots and using vacant land such as barren hills, river banks, and pond edges will also be possible to solve the feed needed for raising pigs, chickens and ducks throughout the city. (3) The climate in Chongqing suburbs is mild, with a frost-free period of 299 days throughout the year, and crops can be harvested twice a year, which is suitable for the development of non-staple food production. (4) Non-staple food production in the suburbs already had a certain production base. In 1958, the output value of non-staple food production of 52 people's communes accounted for 47% of the total agricultural output value. These communes have accumulated certain experience in developing non-staple food production. (5) More importantly, after the rectification of the people's communes in the suburbs, the enthusiasm of the commune members for production has become even higher. Everyone is very enthusiastic about developing diversified operations and developing non-staple food production. Many communes have deployed this year's non-staple food production increase plan, from labor, funds, seeds, feed to product purchase, all links are closely linked, and measures are implemented at all levels. With these favorable factors, coupled with the fact that the Municipal Party Committee has grasped non-staple food production very tightly from the beginning of this year, it has continuously held a series of on-site meetings on the development of live pigs, fruit trees, and aquatic products in less than three months, and promoted the good experiences of various districts and counties. Therefore, the production of non-staple foods in the city this year, especially the production of the three main non-staple foods, vegetables, live pigs, chickens and ducks, has developed rapidly.

Our main practices for developing non-staple food production are as follows:

Strengthen unified leadership and establish specialized management organizations

Strengthening unified leadership and establishing specialized management organizations is an effective way to ensure non-staple food production in the case of relatively busy production tasks. In this regard, Chongqing's specific practice is: under the leadership of the Municipal Party Committee and the Municipal People's Committee, with agricultural and commercial departments as the main body, a group of key personnel are transferred to establish an office for developing diversified economy; and according to the decision of the Municipal Party Committee, the Party Committee Secretary takes the lead, and districts, counties, and people's communes have respectively established production management organizations for developing diversified economy. This unified arrangement of various tasks can not only ensure the focus, but also take into account the general situation. Recently, the commercial department has also sent 51 working groups (about 1,000 people) to various districts, counties, and people's communes to help the agricultural department to uniformly arrange production plans, arrange land, manpower, and varieties, so that production and sales can be closely combined. For example, in arranging vegetable production, agricultural and commercial departments have determined four principles: (1) Vigorously develop local special varieties; (2) Increase variety and pay attention to the arrangement of small varieties; (3) Pay attention to staggered sowing and balanced marketing; (4) Arrange land, far from grain and close to vegetables, to achieve local production and local supply. According to these four principles, a production plan was formulated, and then implemented at all levels. The people's commune allocated the variety, quantity, and labor to the production team. On this basis, the commercial department and the agricultural department signed a production and sales combination contract to fix the commodity part in the form of a contract (the district and county commercial bureau signed with the people's commune, and each supply and marketing cooperative signed with the production brigade). The cadres of the commercial department stationed in the commune also adopted the method of assigning people to fixed points and contracting by zones to help the commune realize the contract. In this way, the people's commune clarified the task of non-staple food production and deeply implemented the task among the masses; the work of the commercial department has also become more active, not waiting for the development of production, but actively organizing production, participating in production, and promoting the development of production.

Strengthen agricultural and commercial cooperation to solve production difficulties

The agricultural and commercial departments of Chongqing have always cooperated very closely in developing non-staple food production. It is precisely because the agricultural and commercial parties have a unified understanding and unified action that problems related to the production, supply, and sales of non-staple foods can be solved in a timely manner. For example, since last year, the commercial department has launched a campaign to do good things for the people's commune in combination with its own business, actively helping the agricultural department to build water conservancy projects, raise funds, and solve the problems of seeds and fertilizers, so as to promote the development of non-staple food production in many ways. The municipal commercial department alone has helped the people's commune to build nine pumping stations, which can irrigate more than 74,000 mu of land and save more than 50,000 rural labor forces; at the same time, it has built more than 2,500 factories (workshops) for processing agricultural fertilizers, pesticides, and feeds. The commercial department also actively purchases agricultural and sideline products, helping the commune to organize cash income. In March alone, it increased the cash income of the people's commune in the suburbs by 71.78 million yuan. In addition, the commercial department also actively helps the people's commune solve the problem of seed sources. Since the beginning of this year, it has solved more than 500,000 jin of vegetable seeds, fruit tree seeds, more than 2,700 excellent seed poultry, 400,000 seed fish, and 20 million fish fry for the commune, which has strongly promoted the development of non-staple food production. On the other hand, the agricultural department also revises the production plan accordingly according to market needs, actively expands the variety of varieties, and meets the different needs of the people.

Combination of centralized and decentralized, public and private raising

Our principle for developing poultry and livestock is: the combination of centralized and decentralized, the combination of public and private raising. On the one hand, there are a certain number of centralized breeding farms. The city has now established 14 Wanji Mountains, 106 medium and small poultry farms, and dozens of Qianzhu farms; on the other hand, it mobilizes the vast number of commune members, urban residents, factories, mines, enterprises, institutions, and schools to raise them in a decentralized manner. At the same time, it is stipulated that when residents and commune members sell privately raised live pigs to the state, they can retain a part of the oil and meat for their own consumption; commune members and residents can freely dispose of privately raised small poultry. This has encouraged the enthusiasm of the masses for production and has greatly promoted the development of production. In terms of vegetable production, we also actively organize production and sales meetings, and organize large factories, mines, enterprises, and schools to directly link up with production teams, reducing circulation links. At the same time, consumer units care about production and provide support to the commune in terms of manpower and materials, which further strengthens the relationship between workers and peasants.

Try every possible means to break through the "six barriers"

To develop non-staple food production, effective measures must be taken to break through various difficulties in production. Generally speaking, six aspects of problems should be solved, namely, seed source barrier, feed barrier, epidemic prevention barrier, labor barrier, equipment barrier, and transportation barrier. Breaking through these "six barriers" will also overcome the main difficulties in non-staple food production. In fact, thousands of barriers and tens of thousands of barriers all come down to a labor barrier. Every task requires labor. Therefore, properly arranging labor has become the key to developing non-staple food production. Through the people's communes in the suburbs, we have organized more than 1,000 specialized non-staple food production teams to focus on the development of non-staple food production; and use the laws of rural busy and slack seasons to adjust the use of labor, and use the surplus to make up for the shortage, which basically guarantees the labor required for producing non-staple foods. At the same time, a system of fixed people, fixed tasks, fixed quality, and fixed quantity has been established to ensure that things are assigned to someone and responsibilities are specialized. Feed is an important link in the development of poultry and livestock production. We rely on the masses to expand feed sources in many ways, use the edges of fields and sides of houses to plant melons and beans, and mobilize the masses to solve the needs of green feed. In addition, we have strengthened the work of epidemic prevention and pest control. Cadres from the agricultural, commercial, and health departments have been transferred to establish "Veterinary Epidemic Prevention Stations." Each people's commune has established "Veterinary Epidemic Prevention Groups" and pest control organizations, and each production team has livestock and poultry health stations and pest control personnel. Since last year, more than 95% of live pigs have been vaccinated and injected to ensure the smooth development of poultry and livestock.

In the development of non-staple food production, there is still a series of arduous tasks to be done in the future; but we are determined to mobilize the masses under the leadership of the Party, muster greater energy, grasp early, grasp tightly, grasp fiercely, and grasp thoroughly from top to bottom, and ensure the realization of the production targets of vegetables, pigs, chickens and ducks, so that people can live better, feel more comfortable, and produce more leaps forward.

    重庆郊区是怎样发展副食品生产的
    重庆市商业局局长　许德
    重庆市农林水利局副局长　张若千
    依靠郊区发展生产，就地供应城市的需要，这是当前城市农业部门和商业部门的一项共同任务。重庆市根据今年1月中央召开的七市、六省副食品生产供应会议的精神，结合具体情况，在市委统一领导下，安排了今年副食品生产计划，决心在保证实现粮食生产指标的同时，大力发展郊区副食品生产，争取在一年以内做到市内主要副食品的供应基本自给。同时，继续贯彻城乡互助的方针，加强城乡物资交流，以组织和调剂更多的副食品，逐步满足城市人民多种多样的需要。
    根据重庆市城市居民几年来蔬菜、猪肉、鸡鸭的消费水平（最多时每人每年平均供应蔬菜七百斤，猪肉三十五斤，鸡鸭一只半），我们算了一下账，只要全年保证有商品菜二十亿斤，育肥猪四十五万头，上市鸡鸭二百一十万只，就可以基本解决这三种副食品的供应问题。
    郊区发展副食品生产的有利条件
    城市郊区发展副食品生产的有利条件很多，从重庆市的具体情况来看，主要是：（1）去年下半年有巴县、綦江、长寿三个县并入市区，郊区农业人口由原来的四十二万六千人增加到二百一十万人（城市人口现为一百九十七万人）。目前发展副食品生产的劳动力约占农村现有劳动力的17％左右（约十九万人），并按照不同地区特点，作了具体安排：以生产副食品为主的人民公社所占劳动力为50％—60％；粮食和副食品生产并举的人民公社为30％；粮食为主的人民公社为10％。这样安排可以基本上解决副食品生产上的劳动力的需要。（2）郊区耕地面积也由原来的五十六万五千亩，扩大为三百七十四万亩，其中蔬菜耕植面积今年安排为三十万亩，全市每人平均有菜地六厘多，今后保证每人每日平均吃菜一斤半是有可能的。饲料地正作安排，估计加上农民自留地和利用荒山、河畔、塘边等空地，对解决全市养猪、养鸡鸭所需要的饲料也是可能的。（3）重庆郊区气候温和，全年无霜期达二百九十九天，农作物一年两熟，适宜于副食品生产的发展。（4）郊区副食品生产原来已有一定的生产基础，1958年有五十二个人民公社副食品生产产值占农业总产值的47％，这些社在发展副食品生产方面都积累了一定的经验。（5）更重要的是郊区人民公社经过整社以后，社员的生产热情更加高涨，大家对开展多种经营、发展副食品生产的劲头很大，很多公社布置了今年副食品增产计划，从劳力、资金、种子、饲料到产品收购都一环一环的扣得很紧，做到了措施落实，层层落实。有了这些有利因素，加上今年市委对副食品生产一开头就抓得很紧，在不到三个月的时间，就连续召开过发展生猪、果树、水产等一系列的现场会议，推广了各区、县的好经验。因此，今年全市副食品生产特别是蔬菜、生猪、鸡鸭三项主要副食品的生产发展较快。
    我们发展副食品生产的主要作法有以下几点：
    加强统一领导，建立专管组织
    加强统一领导，建立专管组织，这是在各项生产任务比较繁忙的情况下，保证副食品生产的一项有效办法。在这方面重庆的具体作法是：在市委和市人委领导下，以农业、商业部门为主，调配一批骨干，成立了发展多种经济办公室；并根据市委决定，由党委书记挂帅，各区、县及人民公社都分别建立了发展多种经济的生产管理组织。这样统一安排各项工作，既能保证重点，又能兼顾一般，最近商业部门还派出五十一个工作组（约一千人），分别到各区、县及人民公社帮助农业部门统一安排生产计划，安排土地、人力和品种，使生产与销售密切结合起来。如农业和商业部门在安排蔬菜生产方面确定了四条原则：（1）大力发展本地的特殊品种；（2）增加花色，注意细小品种的安排；（3）注意排开播种，均衡上市；（4）安排土地，远粮近菜，做到就地生产、就地供应。按照这四条原则，制定了生产计划，然后层层加以落实，人民公社将品种、数量、劳力的分配安排到生产队。在这个基础上，商业部门与农业部门签订产销结合合同，把商品部分用合同的形式固定下来（区县商业局与人民公社签订，各供销社与生产大队签订），商业部门驻社干部还采取定人定点、分片包干的办法，帮助公社实现合同。这样，人民公社明确了副食品生产的任务，把任务深入贯彻到群众中去；商业部门的工作也更加主动，不是等待生产的发展，而是积极组织生产、参与生产、促进生产的发展。
    加强农商协作，解决生产困难
    重庆市农业部门和商业部门在发展副食品生产上一直是合作得很密切的，正是因为农商双方有了统一的认识，统一的行动，所以有关副食品产、供、销方面的问题都能及时得到解决。如去年以来，商业部门结合本身业务，开展了一个为人民公社大办好事的运动，积极帮助农业部门兴修水利，筹集资金，解决种子、肥料，从多方面促进副食品生产的发展。单是市级商业部门即帮助人民公社先后兴办了九个抽水站，可以灌田七万四千余亩，节约农村劳动力五万多个；同时，兴办了农肥、农药、饲料加工等工厂（作坊）二千五百多个。商业部门还积极收购农副土特产品，帮助公社组织现金收入，仅3月份就为市郊人民公社增加现金收入达七千一百七十八万元。此外，商业部门还积极帮助人民公社解决种源。今年以来，一共为公社解决了菜种、果树种等五十多万斤，优良种禽二千七百多只，种鱼四十万尾，鱼苗二千万尾，有力地促进了副食品生产的发展。另一方面，农业部门也根据市场需要，相应地修订生产计划，积极扩大花色品种，满足人民不同的需要。
    集中和分散、公养和私养相结合
    我们发展禽畜的原则是：集中和分散相结合，公养和私养相结合。一方面有一定数量的集中饲养场，全市现已建立了十四个万鸡山，一百零六个中小型养禽场和几十个千猪场；另一方面动员广大社员、城市居民、厂矿企业、机关、学校分散饲养。同时规定：居民、社员私养生猪卖给国家时，可以留下一部分油肉自食；社员、居民私养的小家禽，完全自由支配。这样鼓励了群众生产的积极性，对生产发展有很大促进作用。在蔬菜生产方面，我们还积极组织产销见面，组织大型厂矿、企业、学校直接与生产队挂钩，减少了流转环节。同时消费单位关心生产，从人力物力上给公社以支援，进一步密切了工农关系。
    千方百计突破“六关”
    发展副食品生产，必须采取有效措施突破生产上的各种困难。总的说来应当解决六个方面的问题，即种源关、饲料关、防疫关、劳动力关、设备关、运输关。突破了这“六关”，也就克服了副食品生产中的主要困难。实际上千关、万关说到头来还是一个劳动力关，每项工作需要劳动力，因此，妥善安排劳动力，就成为发展副食品生产的关键。我们通过郊区各人民公社组织了一千多个副食品生产专业队，有重点的发展副食品生产；并利用农村忙闲规律，调剂使用劳动力，以余补缺，基本上保证了生产副食品所需劳力。同时建立了定人、定任务、定质、定量的制度，做到事有所归，责有所专。饲料是发展禽畜生产的重要一环。我们依靠群众从多方面扩大饲料来源，利用田边、屋侧种植瓜豆，发动群众解决青饲料的需要。此外，加强了防疫防害工作，由农业、商业、卫生部门抽调干部，成立了“兽疫防治站”，各人民公社均设立了“兽疫防治组”和防虫组织，各生产队设有畜禽保健站和防害员。去年以来，95％以上的生猪都进行了防疫接种注射，保证禽畜的顺利发展。
    在发展副食品生产上今后还要做一系列的艰苦工作；但是我们有决心在党的领导下，发动群众，鼓足更大的干劲，从上到下抓早、抓紧、抓狠、抓透，确保菜、猪、鸡鸭生产指标的实现，使人民生活得更好，心情更舒畅，生产更跃进。
