Chairman, fellow committee members:

　　I fully agree with and support Premier Zhou Enlai's "Government Work Report" and the reports by Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and Vice Chairman Li Weihan. Now I would like to make a brief speech on the issue of the water conservancy of China and the Sinicization of water conservancy.

　　Our country is advancing towards water conservancy at a high speed, and the Sinicized water conservancy science is also gestating and growing. The task of water conservancy in our country is to completely eliminate flood and drought disasters and to fully and comprehensively utilize water resources. Under the wise leadership of the Party and under the brilliant illumination of the Party's general line for socialist construction, our country has launched a magnificent and large-scale mass movement for water conservancy construction, achieving brilliant results. In the Great Leap Forward year of 1958 alone, 58 billion cubic meters of earth and stone work were completed, the irrigated area was expanded by 480 million mu, the waterlogged area was initially controlled by 210 million mu, and the soil erosion area was initially controlled by 300,000 square kilometers. Such a large scale and such a high speed in water conservancy construction are unprecedented. Relying on the projects built in previous years, especially last year, coupled with the heroic struggle of the masses in drought resistance and flood control, the drought and flood disasters of last year were greatly reduced, and the extraordinary floods of the Yellow River and the Han River were overcome, thereby ensuring a great agricultural harvest last year.

　　Our country's mass water conservancy construction movement has greatly developed the experience of previous generations in water and mountain management, and created many valuable new experiences, enriching the treasure house of water conservancy science and technology.

　　The Party promptly put forward a series of water conservancy construction principles such as: "focusing on water storage, small-scale projects, and self-management by the masses," "a complete water conservancy project system based on small-scale projects, combining large, medium, and small projects, and utilizing both surface water and groundwater," and "fully and comprehensively utilizing water resources." These principles correctly guide the rapid advancement of water conservancy in our country and form the theoretical basis of our water conservancy science. These principles solve the contradiction between "water storage" and "water discharge" and the contradiction between "water use" and "flood control," thereby turning "dead water" into "living water" and "harmful water" into "beneficial water." Implementing these principles, "river network" and "low-lying area transformation" appeared in plain lowlands, allowing for water storage during floods and water use during droughts; in mountainous and hilly areas, there appeared "water diversion up the mountains and ridges, melons growing on vines, canals winding around mountains, river interception at every section, reservoirs and canals connected, water stored in idle times, fields irrigated in busy times, and a combination of diversion and storage for self-flowing irrigation systems"; in soil erosion areas, there appeared "terraced fields on slopes, reservoirs in gullies and rivers, and afforestation of barren mountains and slopes."

　　In the mass water conservancy movement, water conservancy technology has truly taken root among the masses and has blossomed and borne fruit. The masses have not only found experience in governing mountainous areas, plains, and low-lying areas, but also found ways to build small, medium, and large projects in a more, faster, better, and more economical way. For example, the advanced Soviet dam construction experience such as underwater dumping and large blasting, directional blasting, has now become a technology mastered by the vast masses; grass and tree weirs and various dry-stone masonry projects, which are the historical experience of the Chinese masses, have now developed into advanced technologies. This just shows the correctness of implementing the policy of combining indigenous and foreign methods.

　　In the cause of water conservancy and hydropower construction, in hydrology, there are large-scale innovations in instrument measuring tools, mass hydrology, and comprehensive service; in design, the design process is simplified, standardized designs are compiled and adopted, and movable-type design methods are used; in construction, a technical revolution centered on tool reform is carried out, which greatly improves work efficiency and reduces costs. In the field of water conservancy scientific research, because the policy of proceeding from the tasks of socialist construction has been implemented, minds have been liberated, superstitions have been eliminated, and a method combining professional research with mass technical revolution has been adopted. In summarizing the experience of water conservancy, studying the rules of water situation changes in water conservancy areas, high-yield irrigation techniques, using local materials to build dams, rapid construction, saving materials, and using hydropower to generate more electricity, many achievements urgently needed for water conservancy construction and of great scientific significance have been obtained. Due to the above-mentioned technical innovations in various aspects and the fact that water conservancy technology has truly taken root among the masses, a large number of medium-sized projects can be built by the masses themselves; large earth dam projects such as Gangnan (Hebei), Huangbizhuang (Hebei), and Miyun (Beijing), which used to take three or four years to complete according to past experience, can now be completed within a year; large hydropower stations (concrete dams) such as Xinfengjiang (Guangdong), Yanguoxia (Gansu), and Tongtongxia (Ningxia) can start generating electricity after more than a year of construction; large concrete dams such as Xin'anjiang (Zhejiang) and Sanmenxia (Henan) can also be completed two years ahead of schedule. The cost of all water conservancy and hydropower projects has been reduced by half or more compared to the past. All these are the gains of the mass movement centered on the technical revolution, and at the same time, the achievement of these achievements is inseparable from the assistance of the Soviet Union.

　　As mentioned above, the Great Leap Forward in water conservancy and hydropower in our country has provided many creative successful experiences, and pointed out new roads and new methods for water and mountain management, but it has also raised a series of new issues. For example, the issue of the rules of water situation changes in large-scale water conservancy areas and the issue of the joint operation and management of large, medium, and small projects; how much water will be needed, how much water is available, how to make fuller and more rational use of local water, and how to unify the scheduling of national water volume in the future under the policy of "less planting, high yield, and more harvest" and the rapid development of our national economy; how to better and faster solve the equipment, material, and labor bottlenecks in the water conservancy and hydropower leap forward; how to better and more fully utilize hydropower, tidal power, etc.

　　From this, it can be seen that one of the main tasks of our water conservancy workers at present is to timely study and solve the new problems raised in the leap forward of water conservancy and hydropower, and to systematically summarize the rich experience of water conservancy in our country and raise it to theory, which will not only be conducive to a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in water conservancy and hydropower in our country, but also be conducive to the rapid improvement of the level of water conservancy science and technology in our country. This is not a simple and easy task, but as long as we resolutely rely on the leadership of the Party, rely on the masses, go all out, aim high, and constantly push the mass movement centered on the technical revolution to a new climax, we will definitely be able to complete the above-mentioned glorious task well.

### 水利化的中国和中国化的水利  谢家泽委员的发言

　　水利化的中国和中国化的水利
    谢家泽委员的发言主席、各位委员：
    我完全同意并拥护周恩来总理的“政府工作报告”和李富春、李先念两位副总理，彭真副委员长，李维汉副主席的报告。我现在想就水利化的中国和中国化的水利的问题作一个简短的发言。
    我国正在高速度地向水利化迈进，中国化的水利科学也在孕育成长。我国水利化的任务是彻底消灭水旱灾害和充分地综合利用水利资源。在党的英明领导下和在党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，我国开展了规模壮阔、声势浩大的全民兴修水利的运动，取得了辉煌的成绩。在大跃进的一九五八年一年内完成土石方工程量五百八十亿公方，扩大灌溉面积四亿八千万亩，初步治理洼涝面积二亿一千万亩，初步控制水土流失面积三十万平方公里。在水利建设上，这样大的规模和这样高的速度都是空前的。依靠历年特别是去年所修的工程，加上群众在抗旱防汛中的英勇斗争，大大减轻了去年的旱涝灾害，战胜了黄河和汉江的特大洪水，从而保证了去年农业的大丰收。
    我国全民兴修水利的运动大大发展了前人治水治山的经验，创造了许多宝贵的新经验，丰富了水利科学技术的宝库。
    党及时地提出了：“以蓄水为主，以小型为主，以群众自办为主”，“以小型为基础，大、中、小工程互相结合的地上水、地下水互相为用的完整的水利工程系统”，“充分地综合利用水利资源”等一系列的水利建设方针。这些方针正确地指导着我国水利化的迅速前进，并形成了我国水利科学的理论基础。这些方针解决了“蓄水”和“泄水”的矛盾，“用水”和“防水”的矛盾，从而能把“死水”变
  “活水”，“害水”变“利水”。贯彻了这些方针，在平原洼地就出现了涝可蓄、旱可用的“河网化”和“洼地改造”；在山区和丘陵区就出现了“引水上山上塬、长藤结瓜、盘山开渠、节节拦河、库渠相连、闲时蓄水、忙时灌田、引蓄结合的自流灌溉系统”；在水土流失区就出现了“坡地梯田化、沟壑川台水库化、荒山荒坡绿化”。
    在群众性的水利运动中，水利技术在群众中真正扎下了根，并且开了花结了果。群众不仅找到了对山区、平原和洼地的治理经验，也找到了修建小、中、大型工程的多、快、好、省的方法。例如水中倒土和大爆破、定向爆破等苏联先进的筑坝经验，现在已变成广大群众所掌握的技术；草木围埝和各种干砌卵石工程，这是我国群众的历史经验，现在已发展成为先进的技术。这正说明了贯彻土洋结合方针的正确性。
    在水利水电建设事业中，水文方面大搞仪器测具革新，群众水文和全面服务；设计方面简化了设计程序，编制和采用了定型设计，运用了活版设计方法；施工方面开展了以工具改革为中心的技术革命，大大提高了工效，降低了造价。在水利科学研究方面由于贯彻了从社会主义建设任务出发的方针，解放了思想，破除了迷信，采取了专业研究与群众性的技术革命相结合的方法，在总结水利化的经验，研究水利化地区的水情变化规律、高额丰产的灌水技术，利用当地材料筑坝、快速施工，节省材料和利用水力多发电等方面获得不少为水利建设所迫切需要的并有重大科学意义的成果。由于上述各方面的技术革新和水利技术在群众中真正扎下了根，大量的中型工程可用群众自己的力量修成；岗南（河北），黄壁庄（河北），密云（北京市）等大型土坝工程，过去经验要三、四年才能完成，现在可以争取在一年内完成；新丰江（广东），盐锅峡（甘肃），青铜峡（宁夏）等大型水电站（混凝土坝），施工一年多，即可开始发电；新安江（浙江），三门峡（河南）等大型混凝土坝，也可提前两年建成。所有水利水电工程的造价，都比过去降低一半或一半以上。所有这些都是以技术革命为中心的群众运动的收获，同时这些成绩的取得也是与苏联的援助分不开的。
    如上所述，我国水利水电事业的大跃进，提供了很多创造性的成功经验，指出了治水、治山的新道路和新方法，但同时也提出了一系列的新问题。例如大规模水利化地区的水情变化规律问题和大、中、小工程的联合运用管理问题；在“少种、高产、多收”的方针下和我国国民经济的飞跃发展中今后需要多少水，有多少水，如何更充分合理地利用当地的水，如何统一调度全国水量等问题；如何更好更快地解决水利水电跃进中的设备关、器材关和劳力关；如何能够更好更多地利用水力、潮力等等。
    由此可见，我们水利工作者当前的一个主要任务就是及时地研究解决水利水电事业跃进中所提出的新问题，并要系统地总结我国水利化的丰富的经验，提高到理论，这就既有利于我国水利水电事业更大、更好、更全面地跃进，也有利于我国水利科学技术水平的迅速提高。这并不是一个简单轻易的任务，但是只要我们坚决地依靠党的领导，依靠群众，鼓足干劲，力争上游，把以技术革命为中心的群众运动不断推向新的高潮，就一定能够很好地完成上述这个光荣的任务。
