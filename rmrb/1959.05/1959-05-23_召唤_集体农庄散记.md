    Scattered Notes on the "Summon" Collective Farm
    By our correspondent Dai Feng
    The Plan Lags Behind

    Tractor "Commander" Sherokov stood ramrod straight on the wide ridge of the field, a brand new motorized bicycle parked beside him, a layer of thick dust covering its light green frame. His tall figure turned from time to time to the fields around him, occasionally raising his thick right hand to shield his eyes from the dazzling sunlight.
    Sherokov is the chief mechanic of the farm, and he is carefully inspecting the wheat field just sown. At the same time, he is calculating the next work plan, because the farm's spring sowing work was completed twice as fast as originally planned, greatly ahead of schedule.
    This year, the "Summon" Collective Farm, more than 120 kilometers from Moscow, experienced an unprecedented spring. None of the farmers had expected that it would only take five days this spring to sow 556 hectares of spring wheat, oats, and peas. At the beginning of spring, when discussing the seven-year plan at the farmers' congress, everyone calculated carefully and believed that one of the key factors to ensure a bumper harvest in the first year of the seven-year plan (increasing grain production by about three quintals per hectare on average) was to strive for early sowing and fast sowing. After discussion, the farmers decided to complete all spring sowing in ten days, shortening the time by one-third compared to last year. Who knew that it only took half the planned time, five days, to complete the sowing. This unexpected event disrupted the original plan, forcing the "commander" to rush to consider new tasks.
    As long as you walk around the farm, you will easily understand why everyone praises this spring as an "unprecedented spring." After the 21st Congress of the CPSU, the "Summon" farm, like farms all over the Soviet Union, was swept into an unprecedented upsurge of labor enthusiasm. Before the beginning of spring, the tractor drivers repaired the sowing machines in advance, and the seed selectors carefully selected all the good seeds. Thanks to everyone's efforts in accumulating fertilizer, this year's soil fertilizer has increased several times compared to previous years. As early as the end of March, when the snow had just begun to melt, agronomists and tractor drivers stepped on the puddles to inspect the cultivated land and assign spring sowing tasks.
    In late April, the weather turned warmer and spring became stronger. During these days, at four o'clock in the morning, when the stars twinkled and a gust of cold wind blew from the birch forest, the fields were boiling. The old farmers who had been resting for many years could not be stopped this spring, and they also voluntarily asked to participate in production. Administrators and library managers also joined in. Everyone worked together with full enthusiasm. They said that building communism is everyone's business, and it cannot be divided by age or occupation! In this way, miracles were created in ordinary labor, and even advanced plans had to lag behind in the face of active workers. Take the tractor driver Kuznitsov as an example, he completes one and a half to two times the plan every day! If you ask him why he sows so fast, he will proudly say: "To build communism is to race against time!"
    At the "Summon" farm, you can feel the rapid changes in the farm's economic outlook everywhere; at the same time, you can also feel the dramatic changes in people's thoughts and feelings. As the agronomist Yelistratova told us: "This new force seems to be invisible, but it is everywhere. The farm and the farmers seem to have become younger. This spring's sowing is a good start. It seems that the task of completing the seven-year plan in five years will be achieved."

    Two Ivans

    When you come to the "Summon" farm, whether in the fields, in the management office, or even in the farmers' homes, whenever you talk about this year's spring plowing and production, people will mention two Ivans. Ivan Ternov and Ivan Kirikhov are both ordinary tractor drivers, both of similar height, equally taciturn, and often go in and out together. People who don't know the details will surely think they are brothers. In fact, their "brotherly" relationship began to be established this spring.

    The story goes like this:

    Around the 21st Congress of the CPSU, the farmers of the farm were full of enthusiasm. When the Ryazan Oblast first launched the challenge of rapidly increasing meat production, the farmers' hearts were even more uneasy. Every day, farmers went to the management office to ask when to hold the farmers' congress and when to re-discuss the livestock production increase plan. This day finally arrived. At the farmers' congress, everyone spoke enthusiastically, determined to greatly increase the production of meat and milk, and strive to complete the seven-year plan in five years. To achieve this goal, the key is to increase feed. But how to get it? Agronomist Kiselyov suggested expanding the corn planting area, realizing mechanized cultivation, and increasing the yield per unit area. He said: "Like the advanced corn producer Gidalov in Voronezh Oblast, we also organize a corn mechanized cultivation team. The mechanized cultivation team is responsible for the comprehensive work of sowing, cultivating, and harvesting, without a single manual labor, and guarantees 600 quintals of corn silage feed per hectare."

    The task is obviously heavy and complex. Because organizing a mechanized cultivation team is still a new thing, and the so-called "team" is just one or two tractor drivers, plus a complete set of corn cultivation machines. At the same time, the mechanized cultivation team is no longer like the previous situation of planting small pieces of land by hand. The mechanized cultivation team must cultivate at least one hundred hectares. This is equivalent to the work of hundreds of manual laborers in the past, now only one or two people are responsible. This method is undoubtedly the best way out, but who will shoulder this heavy burden?

    Ivan Ternov was the first to stand up and say: "I accept this task. Six hundred quintals per hectare, not even one kilogram less."

    Ivan Kirikhov, who was sitting next to Ternov, also added: "And me, we two will do it."

    In this way, the Farmers' Congress decided that this year the farm's corn arable land would be increased from 80 hectares last year to 160 hectares, and the two Ivans would be responsible for cultivating 120 hectares.

    The corn grown by the two Ivans is enough to feed three thousand pigs. In terms of saving labor, it can save the farm 125,000 rubles a year.

    New Blood is Boiling

    After the 21st Congress of the CPSU, the "Summon" farm was not only shrouded in a high tide of labor enthusiasm, but also in a high tide of political enthusiasm. During this period, the farm's party organization absorbed eighteen new party members, all of whom were advanced elements in production and role models among the masses. At the same time, in the cabinet of the farm party branch secretary, there was also a thick pile of applications for party membership. These different applications for party membership all have a similar sentence: "In order to become a real shock worker in building communism, I request to join the Communist Party of the Soviet Union!" This is not a simple and ordinary sentence. This is a real force.

    New party members have to hold an open party membership meeting, so every meeting is a good opportunity to carry out communist education for the masses.

    The production enthusiasm of the newly joined party members has been greatly improved, and together with the old party members, they have become the main force in completing the production plan.

    Take the newly admitted party member Nozdrina, the librarian, as an example. She is only twenty years old, and she came to the farm voluntarily after graduating from the tenth grade. The farm assigned her to manage books. This year, she heard that she wanted to "catch up with the United States" quickly, and the farm was going to expand the corn planting area, so she ran to the farm chairman and asked to let her be responsible for cultivating 40 hectares of corn. The farm chairman supported her. So, she led everyone to work hard day and night. Everyone praised her as a "good girl" and a "good party member!"

    Yapova and Usayeva are both new party members in the cattle farm, and both are milking experts. They are about to reach the 1962 target - an annual milk production of 6,000 kilograms per cow!

    The "Summon" farm has nearly seventy party members in total. Although they are still a very small number in the total number of farmers in the farm, because they are actively striving to implement the party's instructions, their strength is strong, they are active among the masses, and together with everyone, they ensure the smooth implementation of the party's grand construction plan.

    Old Chairman and New Topics

    The small wooden house of the "Summon" farm management office is located in the center of the farm's residential village. Compared with all the farmers' houses, the house of this management office is particularly simple.

    The management office has a total of three offices, even the chairman's office is small and narrow, under the glass plate of the half-old desk is the production target map of the farm's seven-year plan, and a small bookshelf is piled with several agronomy books and newspapers. There are two rows of wooden chairs against the window and against the wall. There is no conference table, no tablecloth on the desk, and no curtains on the windows. This chairman, who is loved by everyone, is extremely strict and self-disciplined. When he sees the farmers have bought new small cars or televisions, he always smiles as happily as the buyers, but if anyone wants to suggest spending one more kopeck of the farm, he will be severely blamed.

    The chairman of this farm is called Garinin, and he is sixty-six years old this year. He has been the chairman of the farm for twenty-eight years.

    The farm chairman told us a few very telling figures: Before 1953, the total annual income of the "Summon" farm was about 200,000 rubles. In 1953, it increased to 700,000 rubles, in 1957 it increased to 3 million rubles, and last year it was 5.2 million rubles. This year, the total annual income is planned to be 7.6 million rubles, and by the last year of the seven-year plan, the farm's income will increase to 14 million rubles.

    At present, the old chairman is obviously not only concerned about whether the production plan can be completed and the spring sowing task, etc. He is thinking further, and it is a very important new issue. He said: "The farm is getting richer and richer, which is necessary for further consolidating and developing the farm. The question is how to develop, especially at this time when the construction of communism is being fully launched. I think we should industrialize the farm's production and enterprise it, highly mechanize and electrify production, and urbanize the lives of the farmers. We have already figured it out, and we will strive to implement a six-level wage system based on labor quality instead of workdays at the beginning of next year. The minimum wage standard is 400 or 500 rubles, and the high one is more than 1,000 rubles. And farmers have the right to buy farm products at cost prices. As for the issue of farmers' own dairy cows, etc., they will have to wait until the conditions are met to be resolved. As the farm becomes stronger day by day, production is further improved, and products are more abundant, all problems will be solved naturally."

    "In short," the old chairman finally said: "We are on the broad road to communism." (Attached picture)

    “召唤”集体农庄散记
    本报记者　戴枫
    计划落后了
    拖拉机“总司令”雪洛柯夫直挺挺地站在宽阔的田埂上，他的身边停着一辆崭新的机器脚踏车，浅绿色的车身上蒙着一层厚厚的尘土。他那高大的身子不时地转向田野四周，偶而举起粗壮的右手，遮住耀眼的阳光。
    雪洛柯夫是农庄总机械师，他正在仔细地巡视刚播下种子的麦地。同时盘算着下一步的工作计划，因为农庄的春播工作比原计划快了一倍，大大提前完成了。
    今年，这个距莫斯科一百二十多公里的“召唤”集体农庄，经历了一个从未有过的春天。庄员们谁也没有想到，今春只用五天时间就播完了五百五十六公顷春小麦、燕麦、豌豆。入春在庄员大会上讨论七年计划的时候，大家算过细账，认为保证七年计划头一年获得丰收（平均每公顷耕地增产三公担左右的谷物），重要关键之一是争取早播、快播。庄员们一合计，决定用比去年缩短三分之一的时间，也就是只用十天时间全部完成春播。谁知道，现在只用了计划的一半时间，五天就播完了。这个意外，打乱了预定的计划，使得这位“总司令”不得不急忙考虑新任务的安排了。
    只要你到农庄各处走走看看，就不难明白为什么众口齐声地赞叹今年春天是个“从未有过的春天”。在苏共第二十一次代表大会以后，正像全苏联各地农庄一样，“召唤”农庄卷入了一片空前高涨的劳动热情中。开春前，拖拉机手提前修好了播种机器，选种手们仔细地精选了全部良种。由于全体动手积肥，今年的土肥比往年增加了好几倍。还在三月底，积雪刚开始消融，农艺师、拖拉机手们就踏着水洼检查耕地，分配春播任务了。
    4月下旬，天气转暖、春意渐浓。这些日子里，清晨四时，当群星闪烁，白桦林里吹来阵阵冷风的时候，田野里就沸腾起来。过去长年休息的老庄员，今春谁也拦不住，他们也自动要求参加生产。管理员、图书馆的管理员也参加进来了。大家一齐动手，个个干劲十足。他们说，建设共产主义是大伙的事，那能分年龄，分行业呢！就这样，奇迹在平凡的劳动中创造出来了，先进的计划也不能不在积极的劳动者面前变得落后了。就以拖拉机手库兹尼佐夫为例吧，他天天完成计划的一倍半到二倍！你如果问他为什么播得这样快？他会自豪地说：“建设共产主义，就是要同时间赛跑！”
    在“召唤”农庄，到处可以感到农庄经济面貌在迅速变化；同时也可以感到，人们的思想感情也在急剧变化中。正像农艺师叶里斯特洛娃对我们说的：“这股新生的力量，好像是见不到的，但是又到处可见。农庄和庄员似乎都变得年青起来了。今春的播种情况是个良好的开端。看来，农庄五年完成七年计划的任务是会实现的。”
    两个伊万
    来到“召唤”农庄，不论在田间，或者在管理处，甚至在庄员们家里，只要一谈起今年的春耕生产，人们都要提起两个伊万。伊万·捷尔诺夫和伊万·基里霍夫都是平平常常的拖拉机手，两人身材高低相仿，一样沉默寡言，经常一起进进出出。不了解底细的人，准认为他俩是兄弟。其实不然，他俩的“兄弟”关系，还是今春开始建立的。
    事情的经过是这样的：
    苏共第二十一次代表大会前后，农庄庄员们的心里都是热火火的。当梁赞州首先发起迅速增加肉类生产的挑战后，庄员们的心更不平静了。天天有庄员上管理处询问什么时候召开庄员大会，什么时候重新讨论畜牧业增产计划。这一天终于到来了。在庄员大会上，大家热烈发言，决心大力增产肉类和牛奶，争取五年完成七年计划。要达到这个目标，关键是增加饲料。但是，怎样弄到它呢？农艺师基西廖夫建议扩大玉米播种面积，实现机械化耕作，提高单位面积产量。他说：“像伏龙涅什州的玉米先进生产者吉达洛夫一样，咱们也组织玉米机耕队。机耕队负责播种、培植、收割等全面工作，不用一个手工劳动，每公顷保证收玉米青贮饲料六百公担。”
    任务显然是繁重复杂的。因为组织机耕队还是新事，而所谓“队”也不过是一两个拖拉机手，加上全套玉米耕种机器而已。同时，机耕队就不再像先前用手工种小片土地的情况了，机耕队起码要耕种一百公顷。这也等于从前上百个手工劳动的活，现在只有一两个人来负责。这方法无疑是最好的出路了，但这副重担由谁来挑呢？
    伊万·捷尔诺夫第一个站起来说：“我接受这个任务。一公顷六百公担，一公斤也不少。”
    坐在捷尔诺夫旁边的伊万·基里霍夫也接上去说：“还有我，我们两个人来干。”
    这样，庄员大会决定今年农庄的玉米耕地由去年的八十公顷增加到一百六十公顷，而两个伊万负责耕种一百二十公顷。
    两个伊万种的玉米足够喂三千头猪。在节省劳动力方面，一年可为农庄节约十二万五千卢布。
    新的血液在沸腾
    苏共第二十一次代表大会以后，“召唤”农庄不仅笼罩在高涨的劳动热情中，同时也笼罩在高涨的政治热情中。这期间农庄党组织吸收了十八名新党员，他们全都是生产上的先进分子，群众中的模范人物。同时在农庄党支部书记的柜子里还存放着厚厚的一堆入党申请书。这些不同的入党申请书上都有一句类似的话：“为了成为建设共产主义的真正的突击手，我要求参加苏联共产党！”这不是一句简单普通的话。这是一股真正的力量。
    新党员入党要举行公开的入党大会，因此每次大会都是对广大群众进行共产主义教育的好机会。
    新加入组织的党员的生产积极性有了更大的提高，他们和老党员一起成为完成生产计划的主要力量。
    就以新入党的图书管理员诺兹德丽娜为例吧，她不过二十岁，十年级毕业后就自动来到了农庄。农庄分配她管理图书。今年，她听说要快快“赶上美国”，农庄要扩大玉米耕种面积，她就跑到农庄主席那里要求让她负责耕种四十公顷玉米。农庄主席支持了她。于是，她就白天黑夜地带领大家努力工作。谁都夸她是“好姑娘”，“好党员！”
    雅波娃和乌萨依娃都是养牛场的新党员，两个人都是挤奶能手。她们已快达到1962年的指标——每头奶牛年产奶六千公斤！
    “召唤”农庄一共将近七十个党员。虽然他们在农庄庄员总数中还是一个很小的数字，但是由于他们积极努力实现着党的指示，他们的力量是强大的，他们活跃在广大群众之中，和大家一起保证着党的宏伟建设计划顺利实现。
    老主席和新课题
    “召唤”农庄管理处的小木头房子座落在农庄中心居民村的正中，比起所有庄员住宅来，这个管理处的房子显得格外简朴。
    管理处共有三间办公室，就算主席的办公室又小又狭，半旧的办公桌的玻璃板下压着农庄七年计划生产指标图，一个小书架上堆放着几本农艺书和报纸。靠窗靠墙是两排木椅子。没有会议桌，办公桌上没有桌布，窗户上没有窗帘。这位大家所爱戴的主席是极其严明克己的。他在见到庄员们新买了小卧车或电视机的时候，他总是和买主一样喜笑颜开，但是，如果有谁要建议多花农庄的一个戈比，谁就会受到他的严厉责备。
    这位农庄主席叫加里宁，今年六十六岁了。作农庄主席已有二十八年。
    农庄主席告诉了我们几个很能说明问题的数字：1953年以前“召唤”农庄的全年总收入为二十万卢布左右，1953年增加到七十万卢布，1957年增加到三百万卢布，去年是五百二十万卢布，今年全年收入计划为七百六十万，而到七年计划最后一年，农庄收入将增加到一千四百万卢布。
    目前，这位老主席操心的显然已不限于能不能完成生产计划以及春播任务等等，他想的更远，而又是非常重要的新问题了。他说：“农庄越来越丰裕了，这对进一步巩固和发展农庄是必须的。问题是如何发展，特别是在这全面展开共产主义建设的时候。我想，我们应该把农庄生产工厂企业化，生产高度机械化、电气化，农庄庄员生活城市化。我们已经想好，明年初首先争取实行劳动日按劳动质量改为六级工资制。最低工资标准为四百或五百卢布，高的一千多卢布。而庄员有权按成本价格购买农庄产品。至于庄员们手头的奶牛等问题，也都要等待条件具备的时候解决。而农庄一天天强大，生产更加提高，产品也更富裕，一切问题就会自然解决了。”
    “总之，”这位老主席最后说：“我们走的是共产主义康庄大道。”（附图片）
