Comrade Chairman, fellow delegates:

I fully agree with and support Premier Zhou Enlai's report, and agree with the reports of Vice Premiers Li Fuchun, Li Xiannian and Comrade Peng Zhen. These reports comprehensively and systematically summarize the glorious achievements and rich experiences of our people's great revolutionary practice, especially since the Great Leap Forward last year. With irrefutable iron facts, they vividly illustrate the brilliance, greatness, and correctness of the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, illustrate the incomparable superiority of the socialist system over the capitalist system, illustrate the powerful force that lies within the Party's general line of going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in building socialism, and illustrate the boundless revolutionary power unleashed by the liberated Chinese people under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party to rapidly change the historically backward and impoverished conditions, thereby promoting the leap forward of our socialist construction. The tasks and policies proposed in the report fully express the aspirations and urgent demands of the people of the whole country. All the representatives of Shandong unanimously express their resolute support and will mobilize the 50 million people of the province to strive for their complete realization.

Our entire province resolutely supports the measures proposed by Premier Zhou Enlai in his report to quell the rebellion in Tibet and the solemn stance taken. The imperialists and Indian expansionists colluded with each other, disregarding Sino-Indian friendship and the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, openly supporting the rebellious activities of a small handful of reactionary elements in the upper strata of Tibet, and plotting so-called "Tibetan independence." This is a blatant interference in our country's internal affairs, and we are extremely indignant about this. We solemnly warn the imperialists and Indian expansionists: the Chinese people have long stood up. Any conspiracies and intrigues to undermine China's unity and Sino-Indian friendship will never succeed. Like all imperialist aggressions against China in history, they will be crushed by the iron fist of the united Chinese people.

Now I would like to talk about the main situation of industrial and agricultural production in our province in 1958 and some of my personal experiences.

Not to Be Slaves of Nature, but to Be Masters of Nature

Like the rest of the country, Shandong's industrial and agricultural production in 1958 achieved an unprecedented great all-round leap forward. The total industrial and agricultural output value of the province in 1958 increased by 110.6 percent compared to 1957. In agriculture, the output of grain, cotton, and peanuts all increased by more than double compared to 1957. Forestry, fruit, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries also achieved unprecedented development. The victory in agriculture in 1958 is not only reflected in the above figures and achievements, but more importantly, after more than a year of hard work by the broad masses, the natural conditions of our province have been initially and fundamentally changed, laying a good foundation for greater development of agricultural production in the future. For example, in terms of farmland water conservancy, more than 13 billion cubic meters of earth and stone work were done in 1958. The irrigated area of the province was only 4.25 million mu in 1949, accounting for 3.1 percent of the total cultivated land area. It expanded to 30 million mu in 1957, and leaped to 90 million mu in 1958, accounting for more than 70 percent of the cultivated land area. As everyone knows, the Yellow River has always been a serious threat to the people of Shandong. People call it the "harmful river," but now it has begun to benefit the people. Four major irrigation hub projects have been built along the river, with more than 250 inverted siphons set up. Large reservoirs such as Taihang Dike, Dongping Lake, and Nansi Lake have been built. They store water during the flood season and irrigate during the spring and summer. On the vast plains of southwestern and northwestern Shandong, irrigation canals and river networks have been initially formed or are being formed. In addition, the main rivers such as Yi, Shu, Wen, Si, Weiyun, Tuhai, Dagu, Jiaolai, and Wanfu are being comprehensively harnessed, beginning to turn harmful rivers into beneficial rivers. Soil and water conservation in mountainous and plain areas, as well as other small-scale farmland water conservancy construction, all exceeded the total amount of work done in the years since liberation. The masses said: In the past, we "prayed to gods and ghosts" and "relied on heaven for food." Now we despise "Heavenly Father" and anger the "Dragon King." Due to the construction of various water conservancy projects, some places had rainfall of 400 millimeters at a time last year, but basically no flooding occurred; in some places, rainfall was reduced by more than half compared to normal years, and individual areas encountered a severe drought not seen in 50 years, but still won an unprecedented bumper harvest in agricultural production. Afforestation reached 7.17 million mu in 1958, equivalent to 2.8 times that of 1957. Many barren mountains have become orchards, and a green "Great Wall" has appeared along the 1,100-mile coastline of Jiaodong. The dikes on both sides of the Yellow River are turning into tree-lined avenues. More than 50 million mu of various types of poor soil were deep-plowed and transformed last year, turning many sandy and alkaline lands into fertile farmland. Reasonable and fundamental reforms have also been carried out in many aspects of agricultural cultivation techniques. The heroic slogan shouted by the broad masses of people a year ago, "We must be the masters of nature, not the slaves of nature," is now gradually becoming a reality. The realization of people's communes has further made the rural areas take on a new look. It has solved a series of contradictions existing in agricultural cooperatives, thereby greatly liberating rural productive forces, consolidating and expanding the socialist front in the countryside, and improving the communist consciousness of the broad masses of peasants. The relationship between people is also closer and more united. The beautiful prospects of the entire countryside are becoming increasingly clear.

In the Past "Without an Inch of Iron" Last Year Refining Steel in a Big Way

The leap forward in industrial production is also huge and comprehensive. The total industrial output value of the province increased from 3.6 billion yuan in 1957 to 7.6 billion yuan, an increase of more than double. The biggest change is in the smelting industry. A year ago, the province was "without an inch of iron," and the annual steel output was only 21,180 tons. Last year, from scratch, from small to large, in just over four months, 2,743 blast furnaces of 1.5 cubic meters or more (total volume of 9,807 cubic meters) were built, completing and overfulfilling the state's task of 700,000 tons of iron and 200,000 tons of steel assigned to our province, and laying a preliminary foundation for the further development of the smelting industry in the future. In the mass movement of running iron and steel in a big way, not only iron was smelted, but more importantly, "people were smelted." Through the nationwide running of iron and steel, the people's awareness was greatly improved, and a large number of iron and steel technicians were trained. At the same time, with steel as the key link, the overall leap forward of the entire industry was driven. The coal output of the province was 6.16 million tons in 1957, and it jumped to 13.73 million tons in 1958, more than doubling. The machinery, electric power, chemical industry, transportation, and cultural, educational, and health undertakings have also greatly developed. Many products that our province could not produce or manufacture in the past can now be produced and manufactured. The quality and technical level of products have also been significantly improved. According to incomplete statistics, there were more than 9,500 new industrial products in our province last year, and more than 6,200 relatively major inventions and technological innovations. Among them, wheat peeling machines, asbestos spinning machines, 6,000 kilowatt steam turbine generators, internal combustion locomotives, steelmaking converters, and other heavy machinery and equipment were all things we could not manufacture at all in the past. The scale and speed of industrial capital construction are also unprecedented. More than 2,400 industrial enterprises invested and put into production by the state alone (including 32 above the quota). County and commune industries developed from several thousand to more than 700,000 last year (after rectification and merger, there are more than 400,000). Compared with a year ago, the current industrial production in our province has entered a new stage of development. It has laid a preliminary foundation for accelerating the realization of industrialization in our province and the mechanization and electrification of agriculture.

In short, great changes have taken place in industrial and agricultural production in our province in the past year. The reflection of the broad masses of people is: "The year 1958 was extraordinary, one year equals twenty years." Indeed, we have entered a new era that Marx predicted, where "one day equals twenty years." Although we still have many shortcomings, even individual errors, in implementing the Party Central Committee's line, principles, and policies, and there are still some problems in our specific work, these shortcomings and problems should be paid attention to, and we are paying attention to improving them. However, this does not affect the great achievements of our Great Leap Forward in 1958. As Premier Zhou Enlai said in his report: "The development of the national economy in 1958 was not just a general advance, but a huge and comprehensive leap forward." Countless vivid facts from Shandong also prove that this judgment is completely correct.

The General Line is a Lighthouse Illuminating the Road Ahead

In the great leap forward of industrial and agricultural production in the great year of 1958, we deeply realized that the general line formulated by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao is a Marxist-Leninist line that fully reflects the subjective initiative of the people on the basis of correctly reflecting the objective laws of socialist society, and is a lighthouse illuminating the road ahead for socialist construction. Practical experience proves that wherever this general line is resolutely implemented, the situation is lively and vigorous, and the atmosphere is new; conversely, the work there appears cold and backward. The great achievements we have made in industrial and agricultural production are precisely the result of correctly implementing the Party's general line. Over the past year or so, the main obstacles encountered on the road forward have been right-leaning conservative thinking and localism and decentralism. All right-leaning conservatives always succumb to nature, completely negate the dynamic role of people, and disregard the wisdom and power of the liberated broad masses of people. They emphasize that "Shandong has a large population and little land, and coarse grains have low yields," and spread pessimistic fallacies such as "Shandong is special," "conditions are not good," and "increased production is limited" as excuses for their insistence on "less, slower, worse, and more expensive." In order to spread their right-leaning opportunist and capitalist goods, they did not hesitate to wave the banner of localism, insisting that "outsiders do not understand the situation in Shandong" and that "Shandong people should govern Shandong," etc. They regarded themselves as "experts" and used the localist sentiments of some people to engage in "independent kingdoms" to resist the correct line of the Central Committee and the unified leadership of the Party. In order to implement the Party's general line and organize a great leap forward in production, we resolutely struggled against the above-mentioned erroneous tendencies in the rectification campaign and various tasks, thereby clearing away all ideological obstacles on the road forward. In agriculture, we once seized the focus of the struggle between the two lines of "relying on heaven for food or transforming nature," "increased production has reached the top or there is great potential," "crawling or leaping forward," and "agriculture has a great future or no future," and extensively launched a province-wide debate of the whole party and the people, deeply solving the fundamental problem of "being slaves of nature or masters of nature" and "leaping forward or moving slowly." In industrial production, we also seized the focus of the struggle between "politics taking command or technology taking command," "active balance or passive balance," "walking on two legs or walking on one leg," "can industrial enterprises carry out mass movements in a big way," and "seeing both things and people or only seeing things but not people," and launched a great ideological debate, thereby solving the fundamental problem of strengthening the Party's centralized leadership and implementing the mass line. In terms of work style, through the rectification movement, the new forms of great contending, great blooming, great debate, and big-character posters were widely used, and socialist democracy was greatly promoted. At the same time, in the past year, cadres have gone deep into reality, deep into the masses, and participated in physical labor, appearing as ordinary laborers, eating, living, and working with the masses, which has become a common practice. More than 100,000 cadres in the province have been sent to the grassroots and rural areas and factories to labor and train. These methods have achieved good results, and the work style of cadres has been greatly improved, and the "three styles" and "five airs" have been greatly reduced. In addition, we have also widely promoted the method of cadres engaging in "experimental fields," making the combination of politics and business, cadres and the masses closer, following the party's central guidelines of being both red and expert, learning and creating a series of lively and lively working methods (such as leading reality with illusion, and discussing illusion in the context of reality), the mass line and the style of seeking truth from facts have been greatly promoted, and the political enthusiasm and production enthusiasm of the masses have been unprecedentedly high.

However, we deeply know that the achievements and victories of 1958 are only the beginning of things. The development of our various undertakings last year was still very unbalanced. Some regions and units are still in a backward state or have not made enough progress. There are many problems, and there are still many shortcomings, even individual errors, in our work. Therefore, we will never be satisfied with the existing achievements and victories. We must follow the instructions of the Central Committee and Chairman Mao, guard against arrogance and rashness, be modest and prudent, and continue to work diligently and forge ahead victoriously. According to our preliminary plan, on the basis of the great leap forward in 1958, the total industrial and agricultural output value in 1959 will increase by another 58.62 percent. The steel production is required to increase by 140 percent, iron by 68.36 percent, coal by 97 percent, grain by 59 percent, and cotton by 42 percent. At the same time, various undertakings such as culture, education, science, and health will also develop accordingly.

Fully Mobilize the Masses to Overfulfill the State Plan

We believe that this year's situation is more favorable than last year. We not only have abundant resources and abundant labor, but also have the material basis and rich experience of the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production and various undertakings in 1958. More importantly, after a year of great rectification movement last year, the thinking of the whole party and the people has become more unified, and the unity of the party, the relationship between the party and the government and the people has been further strengthened; the style of the leading organs and cadres at all levels has undergone great changes, and the good style of going deep into reality, deep into the masses, and sharing weal and woe and eating, living, and working with the masses has been more widely established; We believe that as long as we unite closely around the party, under the wise and correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and the great leader of the people of the whole country, Chairman Mao, continue to implement the Party's general line for socialist construction, fully mobilize the masses, and rely closely on the masses, the infinite wisdom and labor potential of the people of the province will be fully developed, the rich natural resources will be fully explored and utilized, and the various difficulties on the road forward will be overcome by us one by one. Therefore, we are full of confidence in ensuring the completion and overfulfillment of various tasks of industrial and agricultural production this year. At present, in agricultural production, we are launching a production upsurge centered on spring plowing and sowing and field management of wheat, and continuing to engage in water conservancy and fertilizer accumulation movements in a big way; in industrial production, centering on the main indicators of steel, coal, and machinery, we have launched a technical revolution and technological innovation centered on
  "six comparisons" (comparing enthusiasm, comparing output, comparing quality, comparing labor productivity, comparing technology, comparing safety) red flag competition movement. We firmly believe that we will be able to complete and overfulfill the state plan in industrial and agricultural production this year.

    山东工农业生产的巨大发展是执行党的总路线的结果
    谭启龙代表的发言主席、各位代表：
    我完全同意和拥护周恩来总理的报告，同意李富春、李先念副总理和彭真同志的报告。这些报告，全面地系统地总结了我国人民伟大革命实践特别是去年大跃进以来的辉煌成就和丰富经验，以无可争辩的铁的事实，生动地说明了党中央和毛主席领导的英明、伟大、正确，说明社会主义制度较资本主义制度具有无可比拟的优越性，说明党所提出的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线具有强大的威力，说明解放了的中国人民，在中国共产党的领导下，为了迅速改变历史遗留下来的贫困落后面貌，发出了无穷无尽的强大革命力量，从而推进我国社会主义建设事业的飞跃前进。报告中所提出的任务和政策，充分表达了全国人民的愿望和迫切要求，我们山东全体代表一致表示坚决拥护并动员全省五千多万人民为其彻底实现而奋斗。
    我们全省人民坚决拥护周恩来总理在报告中提出的平息西藏叛匪的措施和所采取的严正立场。帝国主义和印度扩张主义分子狼狈为奸，竟不顾中印友谊和和平共处五项原则，公开支持西藏一小撮上层反动集团的叛乱活动，策划所谓“西藏独立”，这是对我国内政的粗暴干涉，我们对此感到万分愤慨。我们正告帝国主义和印度扩张主义分子：中国人民早已站立起来了，任何破坏中国统一和中印友谊的阴谋诡计，决不能得逞，它将同历史上所有帝国主义侵略中国的下场一样，被中国人民团结的铁拳打得粉碎。
    下面我想谈一谈我省一九五八年工农业生产的主要情况和个人的一点体会。
    不做自然的奴隶要做自然的主人
    和全国一样，一九五八年山东工农业生产都获得了空前伟大的全面跃进。全省工农业总产值，一九五八年较一九五七年增长了百分之一百一十点六。在农业方面，粮食、棉花、花生的产量都比一九五七年增长一倍以上，林、果、牧、副、渔业也获得了空前的发展。一九五八年农业方面的胜利，不单单是表现在上述数字和成绩上，更重要的是经过广大群众一年多的大干、苦干，初步从根本上改变了我省的自然条件，为今后农业生产的更大发展打下了良好基础。例如，就农田水利来说，一九五八年做了土石方工程一百三十多亿公方，全省水浇地面积，一九四九年只有四百二十五万亩，占总耕地面积的百分之三点一，一九五七年扩大到三千万亩，一九五八年一跃达到九千万亩，占耕地面积的百分之七十以上。大家都知道，黄河历来是山东人民的严重威胁，人们称它为“害河”，如今已开始为人民造福，沿河两岸先后修建了四大灌溉枢纽工程，设置虹吸管二百五十余条，建成了太行堤、东平湖、南四湖等大型水库，汛期进水，春夏灌溉。在鲁西南、鲁西北的广大平原上，纵横灌溉渠道和河网已经初步形成或正在形成。此外，沂、沭、汶、泗、卫运、徒骇、大沽、胶莱、万福等主要河流正在全面治理，开始变害河为利河。山区和平原水土保持，以及其他小型农田水利建设，去年一年也都超过了解放以来几年所做工程的总和。群众说：过去是“求神祷鬼”，“靠天吃饭”，现在是蔑视“天公”，气死“龙王”。由于各项水利工程的兴建，去年有些地方曾一次降雨四百公厘，基本上没有形成涝灾；有些地方，雨量较常年减少二分之一以上，个别地区遇到了五十年未见的特大干旱，仍然夺得了农业生产的空前丰收。植树造林，一九五八年达七百一十七万亩，相当于一九五七年的二点八倍，许多秃山变成了花果山，在胶东一千一百华里的海岸线上，出现了一带绿色“长城”，黄河两岸大堤正变成林荫大道。对各种不良土壤，去年一年深翻和改造了五千多万亩，使许多沙碱薄地变成了肥沃良田。农业耕作术技，在许多方面也进行了合理的根本性的改革。一年以前广大人民群众喊出的“要做自然的主人，不做自然的奴隶”的豪迈口号，现在逐步变为现实了。人民公社化的实现，更使农村面貌焕然一新，它解决了农业合作社内存在的一系列的矛盾，从而大大解放了农村生产力，巩固和扩大了社会主义在农村的阵地，提高了广大农民群众的共产主义觉悟，人与人之间的关系也更加亲密和团结了，整个农村的美好前景越来越看得清楚了。
    过去“手无寸铁”去年大炼钢铁
    工业生产的跃进也是巨大的、全面的。全省工业总产值由一九五七年的三十六亿元增长到七十六亿元，即增长一倍以上。变化最大的是冶炼工业，在一年以前，全省是“手无寸铁”，钢年产量只有二万一千一百八十吨。去年从无到有，由小到大，仅四个多月的时间，就建起了一点五立方米以上的高炉二千七百四十三座（总容积九千八百零七立方米），提前并超额完成了国家分配给我省的七十万吨铁和二十万吨钢的任务，并为今后冶炼工业的进一步发展打下了初步基础。在大办钢铁的群众运动中，不仅炼了铁，更重要的是“炼了人”，通过全民办钢铁，大大提高了人民的觉悟，培养了大批钢铁技术人员。同时，以钢为纲，带动了整个工业的全面跃进。全省煤炭产量，一九五七年是六百一十六万吨，一九五八年一跃达到一千三百七十三万吨，翻一番以上。机械、电力、化工、交通等工业和文化、教育、卫生事业亦有很大的发展。许多我省过去不能生产、不能制造的产品，现在可以生产制造了。产品质量和技术水平也有了显著的提高。据不完全的统计，我省去年工业新产品有九千五百余种，比较重大的发明创造和技术革新有六千二百余件，其中，小麦脱皮机、石棉纺纱机、六千瓩汽轮发电机、内燃机车、炼钢转炉及其他重型机械设备等，都是我们过去根本不能制造的。工业基本建设的规模和速度亦是前所未有的，仅国家投资新建并投入生产的工业企业即达二千四百多个，（内限额以上的三十二个）。县、社工业，去年由几千处发展到七十多万处（经过整顿合并为四十余万处）。和一年前比较，目前我省工业生产已进入了一个新的发展阶段，它为加速实现我省的工业化以及农业的机械化、电气化奠定了初步基础。
    总之，一年来，我省的工农业生产发生了巨大的变化，广大人民的反映是：“五八年，不平凡，一年等于二十年”。的确，我们是进入了马克思所预言的“一天等于二十年”的新时代。虽然我们在执行党中央的路线、方针、政策等方面还存在着不少缺点，甚至个别错误，我们在具体工作中也还存有一些问题，对这些缺点和问题，是应该加以重视的，我们已在注意改进中。但是，这并不影响我们一九五八年大跃进的伟大成就。正如周恩来总理在报告中所说：“一九五八年国民经济的发展，不是一般的前进，而是一个巨大的、全面的跃进。”从山东无数生动的事实也证明这个论断是完全正确的。
    总路线是照耀前进道路的灯塔
    在伟大的一九五八年工农业生产的大跃进中，使我们深刻地体会到：党中央和毛主席制定的总路线是一条在正确反映社会主义社会的客观规律的基础上充分发挥人民群众主观能动作用的马克思列宁主义路线，是照耀社会主义建设事业前进道路的灯塔。实践经验证明，那里坚决贯彻执行了这条总路线，那里的局面就生动活泼，气象一新；反之，那里的工作就显得冷清和落后。我们工农业生产所取得的巨大成就，正是由于正确贯彻执行了党的总路线的结果。一年多来，在前进道路上所遇到的障碍主要的是右倾保守思想和地方主义、分散主义。一切右倾保守主义者，总是屈服于自然，完全否定人的能动作用，无视解放了的广大人民群众的智慧和威力，他们强调“山东人多地少，杂粮低产”，“文化、技术落后”，散布什么“山东特殊”，“条件不好”，“增产有限”等等悲观谬论，作为他们坚持“少慢差费”的遁词借口。他们为了散布其右倾机会主义和资本主义的货色，不惜打着地方主义的旗子，硬说“外来人不了解山东情况”，要“鲁人治鲁”等等，他们以“专家”自居，利用某些人的地方主义情绪，搞“独立王国”，与中央的正确路线和党的统一领导相对抗。为了贯彻党的总路线，组织生产大跃进，我们在整风和各项工作中，坚决与上述种种错误倾向进行了严肃地斗争，从而扫清了前进中的一切思想障碍。在农业方面，我们曾经抓住“靠天吃饭，还是改造自然”、“增产到了顶，还是潜力很大”、“是爬行，还是跃进”、“农业大有前途，还是没有前途”等两条路线斗争的焦点，广泛地展开了全党全民的大辩论，深透地解决了“是作自然的奴隶，还是作自然的主人”，“是跃进，还是慢进”，这样一个根本问题。在工业生产上，也同样抓住“政治挂帅，还是技术挂帅”、“积极的平衡，还是消极的平衡”、“两条腿走路，还是一条腿走路”、“工业企业能不能大搞群众运动”、“见物又见人，还是只见物不见人”等斗争焦点，展开思想上的大论战，从而解决了加强党的集中领导、贯彻群众路线这样一个根本问题。在工作作风上，通过整风运动，广泛运用了大鸣、大放、大辩论、大字报这个新的形式，大大发扬了社会主义民主。同时，一年来，干部深入实际，深入群众，参加体力劳动，以普通劳动者姿态出现，同群众同吃同住同劳动，已经成为普遍风气，全省有十万多名干部下放到基层和农村、工厂劳动锻炼。这些方法，已经收到了良好的效果，干部作风有了很大改进，“三风”、“五气”大大的减少了。此外，我们还普遍地推广了干部搞“试验田”的方法，使政治与业务、干部与群众更加密切地结合起来，遵循着党中央指出的又红又专的方针，学习与创造了一系列的生动活泼的工作方法（如以虚带实，就实论虚等），群众路线与实事求是的作风大为发扬，群众政治积极性和生产积极性空前地高涨起来。
    但是，我们深知，一九五八年的成就和胜利还只是事情的开始，我们去年各项事业的发展还是很不平衡的，有的地区和单位仍然处于落后状态或者跃进的不够，问题很多，我们的工作还有不少缺点，甚至个别错误。因此，我们决不满足于已有的成绩和胜利。我们当遵照中央和毛主席的指示，戒骄戒躁，谦虚谨慎，继续兢兢业业，乘胜前进。我们初步计划，在一九五八年大跃进的基础上，一九五九年工农业总产值再增加百分之五十八点六二，要求钢产量增长百分之一百四十，铁增长百分之六十八点三六，煤炭增长百分之九十七，粮食增长百分之五十九，棉花增长百分之四十二。同时，文教、科学、卫生等各项事业都有相应发展。
    充分发动群众超额完成国家计划
    我们认为，今年的形势较去年更为有利。我们不仅有丰富的资源和充沛的劳力，有一九五八年工农业生产和各项事业大跃进的物质基础和丰富经验，更重要的是经过去年一年的伟大整风运动，全党全民的思想更加一致了，党的团结、党和政府与人民的关系更加加强了；各级领导机关和干部的作风有了很大转变，深入实际深入群众、和群众同甘共苦同吃同住同劳动的优良作风已较普遍地树立起来；我们相信，只要我们紧密地团结在党的周围，在党中央和全国人民的伟大领袖毛主席的英明正确领导下，继续贯彻党的社会主义建设总路线，充分发动群众，紧紧依靠群众，全省人民的无穷智慧和劳动潜力将被充分地发扬起来，丰富的自然资源将被充分地发掘和利用起来，前进道路上的各种困难都将被我们一个一个克服掉。因此，我们对保证完成和超额完成今年工农业生产的各项任务满怀信心。当前我们在农业生产上，正在掀起以春耕春种和小麦田间管理为中心的生产高潮，并继续大搞水利和积肥运动；在工业生产上，围绕钢铁、煤炭、机械等主要指标、开展了以技术革命和技术革新为中心的
  “六比”（比干劲、比产量、比质量、比劳动生产率、比技术、比安全）红旗竞赛运动。我们坚信，今年在工农业生产上一定能够完成和超额完成国家计划。
