Remembering Comrade Ajoy Ghosh of India
Xu Qinwen

    Comrade Ajoy Ghosh, one of the founders and General Secretary of the Communist Party of India, visited Hangzhou with his wife in late September 1957. Together, they toured the Lingyin Temple and other places, witnessing many relics of Sino-Indian cultural exchange dating back over a thousand years and hearing many stories about the friendship between China and India. During a meal, I told them about Mr. Tagore's lecture at the Temple of Agriculture in Beijing. They were very pleased to hear this.

    "We are neighbors, we are good friends!"

    Everyone said this repeatedly, and at the train station during our farewell, they said it with the same warmth.

    Comrade Ghosh was a writer, a mineralogist, and a professor of history at the University of Calcutta, with extensive knowledge and abilities. He also paid attention to understanding China's children's literature. Although their visit to Hangzhou was said to be for sightseeing, he was writing late into the night, working diligently, and full of energy.

    In the past year and a half, I have seen Comrade Ghosh's just remarks in the newspapers several times. Recently, I read in the newspaper that on April 23rd in Lucknow, he said: "Those who want to harm the friendly relations between India and China are only helping those imperialist countries that are trying to regain control of Asia." He also said at a mass rally in the Northern Province: "If the friendly relations between India and China are harmed in any way, it will be an unfortunate day for India, China, and the whole of Asia."

    This is absolutely true. China and India have a combined population of over one billion, which is a powerful force. The imperialists are afraid that we will unite closely and are doing everything possible to sow discord. If anyone does anything to harm Sino-Indian friendly relations, they have fallen for the imperialists' trick.

    The friendly relations between China and India have a long history of two thousand years. Taking Hangzhou's Lingyin Temple as an example, it is said to have been founded by the eminent Indian monk Huili more than 1,600 years ago, and the "Pagoda of Master Li" remains as a memorial. Regarding the Feilai Peak in front of the temple, ancient Chinese people wrote many verses:

    "Feilai Peak, from whence did you come? Some say from the Vulture Peak in Central India.
    Feilai Peak, what is your purpose? To build the Lingyin Temple on the Central Tianzhu Mountain.
    Where did this peak ultimately come from? People say it came from Tianzhu in the east.
    Suspicious of transforming to immortality, this peak should be named Vulture."

    Here, the first and third "Tianzhu" and the two "Vulture" undoubtedly refer to India. These verses are all due to the imagination of the friendly relations between China and India. Such deeply rooted Sino-Indian friendly relations should not be harmed, nor can they be destroyed.

    We firmly believe that the Indian people will always be friendly with the Chinese people, unite closely, and never allow anyone to harm our friendly relations. Whoever attempts to harm the friendly relations between China and India is cutting themselves off from the people and will be hated by the Indian people, hated by the Chinese people, and hated by the people of the entire Asia!

    The more than thirteen-丈-high main hall of Lingyin Temple, which had collapsed, has been renovated with much manpower and material resources, and Comrade Ghosh has already seen it. Now, the Buddha statues in this hall have also been re-sculpted by professors from the Academy of Fine Arts and folk artists. The golden Buddha statues appear majestic and solemn in this magnificent hall. This, in addition to demonstrating China's correct religious policy, also embodies the importance attached to the historical sites related to Sino-Indian cultural exchange.

    "We are neighbors, we are good friends!"

    This is the heartfelt voice of the Indian people, and it is also the heartfelt voice of the Chinese people.

    怀印度高士同志
    许钦文
    印度共产党的创造人之一、印共总书记阿约艾·高士同志，于1957年9月下旬偕着他的夫人来到杭州，一道游了灵隐寺等处，看到了许多早在一千多年以前中印文化交流的遗迹，听到了许多有关中印两国友好的故事。在陪餐时我告诉了他们泰戈尔先生在北京先农坛讲演时的情况。他们听得很高兴。
    “我们是邻国，是好朋友！”
    大家屡次这样说，临别在火车站，也是这样热情地说。
    高士同志是作家，是矿物学家，也是加尔各答大学的历史教授，博学多能。他又注意了解我国的儿童文学。他们来杭州，虽然说是为着游览，可是他夜半写稿，工作认真，是干劲冲天的。
    一年半来，我已好几次从报纸上看到了高士同志的正义的言论。最近又在报上看到他4月23日在勒克瑙说的话：“那些想要损害印中两国之间的友好关系的人只是在帮助那些正在设法重行控制亚洲的帝国主义国家。”他又在北方省的群众大会上说：“如果印中友好关系受到任何损害，那么对于印度、中国和整个亚洲都将是一个不幸的日子。”
    这是千真万确的，中印两国有着十亿多的人口，是个强大的力量，帝国主义者惟恐我们团结得紧，千方百计地来挑拨离间。如果有谁做了损害中印友好关系的事，那是上了帝国主义者的当。
    中印两国的友好关系已有两千年的悠久历史。单就杭州的灵隐寺来说，相传这由印度慧理高僧创建，已是一千六百多年以前的事，如今留着“理公之塔”的纪念物。对于这寺前面的飞来峰，我国古人写过不少词句
    “飞来峰，来何从？或云中天竺国灵鹫东。
    飞来峰，来何意？乃造三天竺山灵隐寺。
    此峰毕竟来何处？人言来自天竺东。
    恍疑羽化欲登仙，此峰自合名灵鹫。”
    这里第一和第三两个“天竺”，和两个“灵鹫”，无疑指印度，这些词句都是由于想像中印两国的友好关系的。这样根深蒂固的中印友好关系是不应该损害的，也是不可能破坏的。
    我们深信：印度人民必然同我国人民始终友好，紧密团结，决不让人来损害我们的友好关系。谁妄想损害中印两国的友好关系，谁就是自绝于人民，必将为印度人民所厌恶，为中国人民所厌恶，也为整个亚洲的人民所厌恶！
    灵隐寺坍塌了的十三丈多高的大殿，用了许多人力物力，修理一新，高士同志已经看到。现在这大殿里的佛像，也已由美术学院的教授和民间艺人合作，重新塑造成功。金光闪闪的佛像，在这巍峨的大殿里，显得雄伟庄严。这除了表现我国正确的宗教政策以外，也体现了对于有关中印文化交流古迹的重视。
    “我们是邻国，是好朋友！”
    这是印度人民的心声，也是中国人民的心声。
