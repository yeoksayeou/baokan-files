Comrade Chairman, fellow committee members:

I fully endorse Premier Zhou Enlai's Government Work Report and agree with the reports made by Vice-Premier Li Fuchun, Vice-Premier Li Xiannian, and Vice-Chairman Li Weihan.

The 1959 National Economic Plan is a grand plan, a plan for continued great leaps forward. The most fundamental guarantee for completing this plan on the industrial front is to combine strengthened leadership with the vigorous development of mass movements, and to launch mass movements for technological revolution and technological innovation in all industrial and mining enterprises to increase labor productivity. In order to deeply and persistently carry out the mass movement of increasing production and practicing economy, it is necessary to mobilize the initiative of every worker from a political and ideological perspective and strengthen political and ideological education in industrial and mining enterprises.

Last year, on the basis of the great rectification movement, socialist and communist education was universally carried out in industrial and mining enterprises, which greatly improved the ideological awareness of workers and staff, and communist spirit soared. Labor without regard to remuneration, work without regard to conditions, the advanced striving to be more advanced, and the backward determined to catch up with the advanced have become the main ethos of workers and staff. This ethos is changing the mental outlook of industrial and mining workers and staff, and also changing the production outlook of industrial and mining enterprises. At present, various regions are doing the work of disseminating advanced ideas and exchanging advanced experiences, which has achieved good results. Experience has proved that to promote production leaps forward, it is necessary to first do a good job of the ideological work of workers and staff. Without advanced ideas, there can be no advanced indicators and advanced measures. This requires conducting thorough and meticulous political and ideological education work in the vigorous mass movement. Based on the key issues and weak links in production, analyze the ideological conditions of workers and staff and improve their ideological awareness. For major issues, adopt the methods of extensive airing of views, full expression of ideas, big-character posters, and great debates to expose contradictions in production and work, and rely on the masses to resolve these contradictions. Through political education and the self-education of the masses, workers and staff can more deeply understand the tasks put forward by the Party at this time, and know more clearly how to contribute to the building of socialism. In this way, the vigorous mass movement can be carried out more deeply and persistently.

Do a good job in political and ideological education work, and deeply carry out the movement of increasing production and practicing economy.

In political and ideological education, combining the current situation and tasks with the production conditions of industrial and mining enterprises and workshops for publicity will enable every worker and staff to fully recognize the political and economic significance of completing their own production tasks, and clarify the relationship between their labor and socialist construction. In this way, the patriotism of the workers and staff and their enthusiasm for socialist construction are combined, and the current political struggle and production struggle are closely combined. This year, in the publicity of the four great leap forward indicators of steel, coal, grain, and cotton, because various localities have implemented the spirit of the whole country as one chessboard based on the production situation in industrial and mining enterprises, the communist spirit of cooperation has greatly increased in the mass movement of increasing production and practicing economy. We believe that the 1959 National Economic Plan passed by this National People's Congress will become a clarion call to encourage workers and staff to make great leaps forward, and become a driving force for continuing to implement the general line of socialist construction after vigorous publicity.

Strengthen the education of new workers.

At present, an important task in the political and ideological education work of industrial and mining enterprises is to educate new workers. Many new workers were added last year. This team is basically good, with good components, many young people, and a relatively high level of education. However, in order for them to quickly play a role in production, it is necessary to conduct meticulous political education based on their ideological conditions, so as to rectify and consolidate this team. It is also necessary to educate them on the communist attitude to labor; quickly improve their technical level, so that they become a new force in production. At present, many industrial and mining enterprises are carrying out the "Five Goods" excellent apprentice competition (good political thought, good study, good labor discipline, good respect for the master, good unity and mutual assistance) in conjunction with the mass movement of increasing production and practicing economy, and organize old workers to carry out the "Four Packages" for new workers (that is, package ideological work, package care for life, package technical learning, package production operation), as well as the new worker education meetings and new worker representative meetings convened by the Communist Youth League, the Women's Federation, and the Trade Union in various provinces and cities under the leadership of the Party Committee, which have played a very good role in doing a good job in the work of new workers.

The cultural education of workers and staff has achieved great results, promoting production and technological innovation.

The Premier put forward our tasks on the cultural and educational front in the Government Work Report. As a component of the cultural and educational front, the education work of workers and staff in industrial and mining enterprises, as the Premier pointed out in the report, has also made great progress last year. After the Second Session of the Eighth National Congress of the Party issued the great call for technological revolution and cultural revolution, with the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, the political enthusiasm and learning enthusiasm of workers and staff were unprecedentedly high. According to statistics from many provinces and cities, the number of people who eliminated illiteracy and the enrollment rate of workers and staff last year greatly exceeded the number in previous years. For example, according to statistics from the industrial, transportation, postal and telecommunications, and basic construction systems in Liaoning Province in October last year, among 1.35 million workers and staff, only 9.8 percent were illiterate, 56.4 percent had a primary school education, 26.2 percent had a junior high school education, 5.8 percent had a senior high school education, and 1.8 percent had a junior college education. The number of people who eliminated illiteracy in Liaoning Province last year was equal to 80 percent of the total in the past eight years. As of the end of September last year, a total of 138,440 workers and staff in Jiangxi Province had eliminated illiteracy, accounting for 82.15 percent of the total number of illiterate young and middle-aged people. The proportion of illiterate young and middle-aged workers and staff has dropped from 80 percent before liberation to 6.9 percent. The number of workers and staff enrolled in school has also increased significantly. At present, many industrial and mining enterprises have established a worker and staff education system from primary school, middle school to university. In many industrial and mining enterprises, production is the center, and the combination of production, education, and scientific research, and the combination of political education, technical education, and cultural education are implemented. This progress in the education of workers and staff has also played a positive role in carrying out technological revolution and technological innovation, and in improving labor productivity.

When many workers and staff removed the label of illiteracy, they wrote letters, poems, and big-character posters to express their infinite gratitude to the Party. A worker in Yunnan wrote: "When the moon comes out, the moon is clear, buy a piece of white cloth and embroider a handkerchief, embroider Chairman Mao on it, and embroider the great cultural advance below." In the past, many underground workers in the Zhaoge Zhuang Coal Mine of Kailuan, Tangshan, could not calculate coal production and could not fill out reports. When they learned this knowledge in cultural classes, they solved the difficulties in production work. Many industrial and mining facts prove that wherever the cultural level of workers and staff is relatively high, the mass technological revolution and technological innovation are carried out quickly. There are many examples of workers and staff improving and creating in production by improving their cultural and technical level. For example, Ruan Chengpu, a worker in Taiyuan Iron and Steel Company, was originally illiterate. After cultural and technical studies, he used the principle of physics pulley to transform the equipment that did not stop the car, which greatly improved production efficiency and could increase the country's steel plate production by 420 tons throughout the year. Jin Xishan, an old electric welding worker in Yunnan, was able to write simple plans and summaries after removing the label of illiteracy. He went to senior primary school to learn arithmetic, and overcame the difficulty of not being able to calculate the amount of materials, which improved work efficiency dozens of times. All of these illustrate that cultural revolution and technological revolution are complementary; all prove that with the arrival of the socialist economic upsurge, a socialist cultural upsurge has been set off in our country.

Rely on the leadership of the Party, organize cooperation in all aspects, popularize education, and train cadres.

The National Conference on Education Work for Workers and Staff in Industrial and Mining Enterprises, which was held not long ago, based on the Party's education policy and the needs of socialist construction and development, and on the basis of summarizing the work in 1958, put forward the task of education work for workers and staff in the future: to popularize education and train cadres among workers and staff. This is a great and arduous historical task. In order to complete this task, it is necessary to earnestly implement the Party's education policy based on the characteristics of industrial and mining enterprises and workers and staff: "Education serves proletarian politics, and education is combined with productive labor." Factories running education must proceed from production, closely combine with production, and serve production, so that education work can play a role in promoting production and improving production. To achieve this task, it is necessary to make education subordinate to production, flexibly arrange teaching time according to the specific conditions of industrial and mining production, and adhere to teaching by adopting a variety of methods on the premise of subordinating to production and relying on the enthusiasm of the masses.

The experience of past years and the experience of the huge development of worker and staff education last year have proved that the fundamental guarantee for running worker and staff education in industrial and mining enterprises well is to strengthen the leadership of the Party. The trade union is a communist school and has a major responsibility for worker and staff education work. It must work actively under the leadership of the Party committees at all levels and in accordance with the instructions of the Premier in the report, so that worker and staff education can be continuously improved in development. Because the cultural level of workers and staff is still very low, most of them are still at the primary school level. To popularize education among such a large number of workers and staff and train a large number of construction cadres, it is impossible for the trade union to complete this serious task with a part of its strength. Under the leadership of the Party committees at all levels, the trade union organization should closely cooperate with the government's production departments, education departments, the Communist Youth League, the Science Popularization Association, the Women's Federation and other relevant units to run worker and staff education well. We believe that due to the strengthening of leadership by Party committees at all levels and the close cooperation of all relevant departments, after active, down-to-earth and unremitting efforts, the task of popularizing education, training cadres and realizing the intellectualization of the working masses among the vast number of workers and staff in industrial and mining enterprises can be gradually and victoriously completed.

The political, cultural, and technical education work carried out by the trade union organization in industrial and mining enterprises has a general purpose, which is to serve the politics of the working class and the socialist cause. It is to implement socialist and communist education, train workers and staff to become workers with socialist consciousness and culture, and make the cause of socialist construction continue to move forward. Therefore, all education work must be carried out under the leadership of the Party, implement the mass line, and conscientiously implement the policy of combining education with productive labor. In order to strive to overfulfill the 1959 National Economic Plan and greet the 10th anniversary of the National Day with more and better results, we will continue to go all out, and in accordance with the Party's guidelines and policies, make political and ideological education more solid and meticulous in the mass movement of increasing production and practicing economy. Run worker and staff education well, so that the cultural education cause of industrial and mining enterprises can be further developed with the leap forward of industrial and agricultural production.

The era when the Chinese people were bullied has passed.

The Chinese working class and working people have always been diligent and peace-loving. They have built their motherland stronger and made their lives better in their hard work. However, when the Chinese working class and working people realize their ideals, they are opposed by domestic right-wing elements and reactionaries, and also opposed by imperialists. The rebellion of the upper-level reactionaries in Tibet is a treasonous act that is hostile to our country and hostile to the progress of the Tibetan people. This rebellion is praised by imperialists and supported by the expansionist elements of the imperialist followers in our neighboring country India. They are raised by British imperialism and want to inherit the mantle of British imperialism, vainly attempting to invade China's territory Tibet, undermine the unity of the Chinese people of all ethnic groups, and undermine the friendship between the Chinese and Indian people. What is Tibet "independence" for, instigating rebellion, supporting rebels, and interfering in China's internal affairs. China is now a great socialist country, and the era when the Chinese people were bullied has passed. We advise the inheritors of the imperialist mantle in India, please be honest, if you try to be stubborn, you will inevitably be battered and bloodied.

### 加强工矿企业中的政治工作

专栏：

    加强工矿企业中的政治工作
    陈少敏委员的发言主席、各位委员：
    我完全拥护周恩来总理的政府工作报告，同意李富春副总理、李先念副总理、李维汉副主席所作的各项报告。
    一九五九年国民经济计划，是一个宏伟的计划，一个继续大跃进的计划。工业战线上完成这个计划的最基本保证，是加强领导同开展轰轰烈烈的群众运动相结合，在各个工矿企业中，开展技术革命和技术革新，提高劳动生产率的群众运动。为了深入地、持久地把增产节约的群众运动开展起来，需要从政治上、思想上动员每一个工人的积极性，加强工矿企业中的政治思想教育。
    去年在伟大的整风运动基础上，工矿企业中普遍开展了社会主义和共产主义教育，大大提高了职工的思想觉悟，共产主义精神高涨。劳动不计报酬，工作不讲条件，先进的争取更先进，落后的决心要赶上先进的，已经成为职工的主要风气。这种风气，改变着工矿职工的精神面貌，也改变着工矿的生产面貌。现在各地都在作传播先进思想、交流先进经验的工作，收到良好的效果。经验证明：要促使生产跃进，首先就需要作好职工的思想工作。没有先进的思想，就不可能有先进的指标和先进的措施。这就要求要在轰轰烈烈的群众运动中，深入细致的进行政治思想教育工作。根据生产中的关键问题和薄弱环节，分析职工的思想状况，提高职工的思想觉悟。对重大的问题，采用大鸣，大放，大字报、大辩论的办法，揭露生产中和工作中的矛盾，又依靠群众解决这些矛盾。通过政治教育和群众的自我教育，使职工更加深刻地领会党在这个时候所提出来的任务，更加清楚地知道自己怎样来为建设社会主义出一份力量。这样就可以更加深入，持久地开展轰轰烈烈的群众运动。
    作好政治思想教育工作，深入地开展增产节约运动
    在政治思想教育中，把当前形势、任务与工矿、车间生产状况结合进行宣传，会使每个职工充分认识到完成本身生产任务的政治意义和经济意义，明确自己的劳动和社会主义建设的关系。这样就把工人群众的爱国主义精神和社会主义建设热情结合起来，把当前的政治斗争和生产斗争紧密地结合起来。今年在宣传钢、煤、粮、棉四大跃进指标中，由于各个地方根据工矿中的生产情况，贯彻了全国一盘棋的精神，使增产节约的群众运动中，共产主义协作的风气大为增长。我们相信，这次全国人民代表大会所通过的一九五九年的国民经济计划，经过大张旗鼓的宣传，更会成为鼓舞职工大跃进的号角，成为继续贯彻社会主义建设总路线的推动力量。
    加强对新工人的教育工作
    当前工矿企业的政治思想教育工作中，有一项重要的任务，就是对新工人进行教育。去年增加的新工人很多，这支队伍基本上是好的，成份好，青年多，文化程度比较高。但是，要使他们在生产上迅速发挥作用，还需要根据他们的思想状况进行细致的政治教育，以便整顿、巩固这支队伍。还需要对他们进行共产主义劳动态度的教育；尽快的提高他们的技术水平，使他们成为生产中的新生力量。目前许多工矿企业结合增产节约群众运动，开展的五好优秀徒工竞赛（政治思想好、学习好、劳动纪律好、尊敬师傅好、团结互助好），组织老工人对新工人进行的四包（就是包思想工作、包照顾生活、包技术学习、包生产操作），以及各省市共青团、妇联、工会，在党委领导下召开的新工人教育会议，新工人代表会议，都对作好新工人的工作，起了很好的作用。
    职工文化教育成绩巨大，推动生产和技术革新
    总理在政府工作报告中，提出了我们在文化教育战线上的任务。作为文化教育战线一个组成部分的工矿企业职工教育工作，正如总理报告中所指出的，去年也有很大的进展。党的八大二次会议发出了技术革命和文化革命的伟大号召以后，随着工农业生产的大跃进，职工的政治热情和学习积极性空前高涨。根据许多省市的统计，去年在扫除文盲和职工入学率上，都大大超过以往几年的数目。例如辽宁省的工业、交通运输、邮电、基本建设四个系统去年十月统计，在一百三十五万职工中，文盲已经只有百分之九点八，高小程度的占百分之五十六点四，初中占百分之二十六点二，高中占百分之五点八，大专占百分之一点八。辽宁全省去年扫除文盲的数字，等于过去八年总和的百分之八十。江西省至去年九月底止，全省职工中共扫除文盲一十三万八千四百四十人，占青壮年文盲总数的百分之八十二点一五，职工中青壮年文盲的比例，已由解放前百分之八十下降到百分之六点九，职工入学人数也大量增加。现在有不少工矿企业，已经建立了从小学、中学到高等学校的职工教育体系。在不少工矿企业中，以生产为中心，实行了生产、教育、科学研究相结合，政治教育、技术教育、文化教育相结合。职工教育的这种进展，对于开展技术革命和技术革新，对于提高劳动生产率，也起了积极的作用。
    很多职工在摘掉文盲帽子的时候，写信、写诗歌、写大字报，表示对党的无限感激。云南有个工人写道：“月亮出来月亮清，买块白布绣手巾，上面绣上毛主席，下面绣上文化大进军。”唐山开滦赵各庄煤矿，过去许多井下工人不会计算煤产量，不会填写报单，在文化课中，学到这种知识，就解决了生产工作中的困难。许多工矿的事实证明，凡是职工文化程度比较高的地方，群众性的技术革命和技术革新就开展得快。职工提高文化、技术水平，在生产上改进和创造的例子就多，如像太原钢铁公司工人阮成谱，原来一字不识，经过文化技术学习，他运用物理学滑轮原理，改装了下车不停套的设备，大大提高了生产效率，全年可以给国家增产钢板四百二十吨。云南电焊老工人金锡山，摘掉文盲帽子以后，能写简单的规划和总结，进高小学了算术，又克服了下料不会计算的困难，提高了工效数十倍。所有这些都说明了文化革命和技术革命是相辅相成的；都证明了随着社会主义的经济高潮的到来，在我国已经掀起了一个社会主义的文化高潮。
    依靠党的领导，组织各方面协作，普及教育，培养干部
    不久以前召开的全国工矿企业职工教育工作会议，根据党的教育方针和社会主义建设发展的需要，在总结一九五八年工作的基础上，提出了今后职工教育工作的任务是：在职工中普及教育和培养干部。这是一个伟大的艰巨的历史任务。为了完成这个任务，需要根据工矿企业和职工的特点，认真贯彻党的教育方针：“教育为无产阶级政治服务，教育与劳动生产相结合”。工厂办教育，就必须从生产出发，紧密结合生产、为生产服务，使教育工作起到推动生产、提高生产的作用。实现这个任务，既要使教育服从生产，根据工矿生产的具体情况，灵活的安排教学时间，又要在服从生产的前提下，依靠群众的积极性，采取多种多样的办法，坚持教学。
    历年来的经验和去年职工教育巨大发展的经验都证明：办好工矿企业职工教育的根本保证，是加强党的领导。工会是共产主义的学校，对职工教育工作负有重大责任，须要在各级党委的领导下面，按照总理在报告中所指示的，积极进行工作，使职工教育在发展中不断提高。由于目前职工的文化水平还很低，多数人还是小学程度，要在这样多数目的职工中普及教育，培养大量的建设干部，工会一部分力量，是不可能完成这个严重任务的。工会组织要在各级党委的领导下面，和政府的生产部门、教育部门、共青团、科普、妇联等有关单位，密切协作来办好职工教育。我们相信，由于各级党委加强领导，各有关部门的密切协作，经过积极地、踏实地坚持不懈地努力，在工矿企业广大职工中普及教育，培养干部、实现工人群众知识化的任务，是能够逐步地胜利完成的。
    工会组织在工矿企业中进行的政治、文化、技术教育工作，一个总的目的，就是为工人阶级的政治服务，为社会主义事业服务。就是为了贯彻社会主义和共产主义教育，培养职工成为有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者，使社会主义建设事业不断前进。因此，一切教育工作，都必须在党的领导下面，贯彻群众路线，认真执行教育与生产劳动相结合的方针。为了争取超额完成一九五九年的国民经济计划，以更多更好的成绩迎接国庆十周年，我们将继续鼓足干劲，根据党的方针政策，在增产节约的群众运动中，把政治思想教育，做得更踏实、更细致。办好职工教育，使工矿文化教育事业，随着工农业生产的跃进，有进一步的发展。
    中国人民被欺负的时代过去了
    中国工人阶级和劳动人民从来就是勤劳的，热爱和平的。他们在自己的辛勤劳动中把自己的祖国建设得更加富强，使自己的生活更加美好。可是中国工人阶级和劳动人民在实现自己的理想时，受到国内右派分子、反动分子的敌视，也受到帝国主义者的敌视。西藏上层反动分子的叛乱，是敌视我们国家、敌视西藏人民前进的叛国行为，这个叛乱受到帝国主义者的赞扬，也受到我们的邻国印度的帝国主义追随者扩张主义分子的支持，他们是英帝国主义豢养的，他们要继承英帝国主义的衣钵，妄想侵略中国的领土西藏，破坏中国各族人民的团结，破坏中国人民和印度人民的友谊。要什么西藏“独立”，策动叛乱，支持叛乱分子，干涉中国的内政。中国现在是一个伟大的社会主义国家，中国人民被欺负的时代过去了，我们忠告印度的帝国主义衣钵继承者，请你们放老实一点吧，如果你们企图顽固下去，必然是碰得头破血流的。
