Overnight Stay on Forest Street
	Qi Fan

	It had been a long time since I’d walked a long distance, and coupled with carrying a heavy bedding roll and a net bag full of odds and ends, my shoulders were sore after only forty-odd li. Walking on mountain paths wasn't so bad, there was always a road of sorts. Going further was even more difficult, walking through vine thickets taller than a person, my feet stepping on tussocks of marsh grass like walking on stilts, and the luggage on either end of my shoulders swayed back and forth constantly, making me feel like a rattle-drum. Although my body felt a bit tired, I had my own "secret recipe" for combating fatigue. Based on my previous experiences walking long distances, when I felt tired, I would think about exciting things, and my spirits would lift, making the road seem shorter. At that moment, scenes from the past year flashed through my mind: last spring, after leaving the army, we arrived in the Great Northern Wilderness. In the wilderness, we built our homes with our own hands - thatched huts; as soon as the snow melted, we sowed seeds on the black, fertile soil, and after arduous digging of canals for drainage, summer hoeing, and autumn harvesting, we finally put the mountain of soybeans safely into storage. Today, in order to supply tens of thousands of cubic meters of timber to Beijing, we have embarked on a new journey, marching towards the forest. Although life in the wilderness was tough, what could be more exciting than creating our own lives with our own hands and creating wealth for the country? Thinking, thinking, my steps seemed lighter, and unconsciously I walked another twenty or thirty li.

	We arrived at a clearing in the forest, passing through a birch forest, at dusk. We were still twenty or thirty li from our destination, and it seemed impossible to reach it before dark. Just as we were worried, we spotted a small thatched shed in the distance, and we ran towards it happily, deciding to stay there for the night. So everyone immediately got to work, cutting tree branches, gathering marsh grass, and re-repairing the shed. Even though it was a temporary stay, we wanted to make life as comfortable and beautiful as possible.

	It gradually grew dark, and in order to keep warm and defend against wild animals, we lit a bonfire in front of the shed. The dry firewood crackled, some people knocked a washbasin full of ice from the ditch to boil water for drinking, and others chatted around the bonfire, talking about the combat life they had experienced, and also about the mysterious stories of the forest they had heard from hunters. At this time, by the light of the fire, I noticed a line of large characters carved on a nearby tree trunk:

	"The owner of this house has moved to Forest Street, Cold Palace City, No. 2."

	What a peculiar city and street name! Only then did we realize that this small thatched shed was not the residence of hunters, but a place where the first group of comrades exploring the forest had stayed. They had opened up the road for us and were waiting for us deep in the forest. Pioneers always yearn for a better life. When we first built a few small thatched huts on the grassland, didn't we call it some village or town? Some comrades even boasted in letters to their comrades that they were the first citizens of such-and-such city! Yes, if we can drive away wolves and sow seeds in the wilderness, why can't we build it into a wonderful city!

	Night deepened, and the stars peered at us with unfamiliar eyes through the cracks in the shed. The wind was howling outside, and the entire forest was like a boiling ocean. I couldn't fall asleep peacefully that night, my heart full of reverie. Tomorrow, a new life will begin. We will use the timber felled by our hands to build thousands of houses in every corner of the motherland, and build thousands of Forest Streets with forest timber…

    夜宿森林街
    齐凡
    长久没走远路了，再加上背着个沉重的铺盖卷，捎挂着装着零七八碎的网兜，只走了四十多里路，肩膀就被勒得酸疼酸疼的。走山路还不觉得怎么样，那总还有条路，再往前走就更艰难了，在高过人头的藤条缝中穿行，两脚踩着靰鞡草墩子，像是踩高蹻，肩膀两头的行李又不住地来回晃动，整个人就像个波浪鼓了。尽管身子感到有些疲乏，不过我也有自己治疲劳的“秘方”。按以往行路的经验，感到疲乏时，多想些激动人心的事情，情绪一振奋，路也就显得短了。这时，我的脑子里闪现着一年来一幕幕的生活图景：去年春天，告别了部队，我们到了北大荒。在荒原上，我们用自己的双手建立起了住宅——茅屋；雪刚一消融，我们就在黑油油的沃土上撒下了种子，之后经过艰辛的挖渠排水，夏锄，秋收，最后终于把堆成山的大豆安安稳稳地入了囤。今天为了要给北京供应几万方木材，我们又踏上了新的征途，向森林进军。尽管在荒原里的生活是艰苦的，但还有什么能比用自己的双手创造自己的生活和为国家创造财富的事能更激动人心呢？想着，想着，步子好像轻快了，不知不觉又走出了二三十里路。
    我们穿过桦树林来到一块林中空地时已是薄暮时分了。离目的地还有二三十里，看样子天黑前是赶不到的。正在发愁，发现远处有个小草棚，我们就欣喜地往前奔去，决定今晚就在这里住下来。于是大家立刻动起手来，砍树枝，割靰鞡草，把草棚又重新修整了一下，尽管是暂时的逗留，我们也要把生活弄得舒适些，美丽些。
    天渐渐黑了下来，为了取暖和御防野兽，我们在草棚跟前点起一堆篝火。干柴哗哗拍拍地响着，有的人从沟里敲了一脸盆冰块来烧水喝，有的人围着篝火漫无边际地闲扯着，谈着自己经历过的战斗生活，也谈着从猎人那里听来的森林中神秘的故事。这时，借着火光，我发现近旁一棵树干上刻着一行大字：
    “本屋主人已迁至冷寒宫市森林街，门牌二号。”
    多奇特的市名和街名！从这里我们才理解到，这个小草棚不是猎人的住所，而是第一批探林的同志们住宿过的地方，他们为我们开辟了道路，已在森林深处等着我们了。开拓者总是最向往美好生活的。当我们在草原上刚搭起几个小茅屋的时候，不是就把它称为什么村什么镇了吗？甚至有的同志给战友的信中还夸耀自己是某某市的第一批公民呢！是啊，我们既然能在荒原上赶走野狼，撒下种子，为什么不能把它建成一座美妙的城市呢！
    夜深了，星星透过草棚的缝隙，用生疏的眼光窥望着我们，外面风在呼啸着，整座森林像是沸腾的海洋一样。这一夜我怎么也不能平静地睡去，心里充满了遐想。明天，新的生活又要开始了。我们要用双手伐下的木材在祖国各个角落，盖起千万间房屋，用森林的木材建设起成千上万条森林街……
