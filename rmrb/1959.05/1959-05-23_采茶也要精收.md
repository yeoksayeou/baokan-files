From the Editor:

	Just as harvesting wheat and rapeseed requires meticulous attention, picking tea leaves demands the same careful and thorough approach. Leaving tea leaves unpicked on the trees is akin to scattering grain on the ground, a wasteful abandonment of readily available wealth. Tea plants have a unique characteristic: leaving the spring tea unpicked significantly hinders the growth of summer tea. Failing to pick tea leaves cleanly not only reduces the spring tea harvest but also impacts the summer tea yield. It's truly a case of: a moment's negligence leads to two seasons of loss.
	To remedy the shortcomings of incomplete spring tea harvests, Zhejiang province has implemented emergency measures, launching a campaign to gather and process the overlooked tea leaves. Many tea-producing regions are currently in the final stages of the spring tea season, and Zhejiang's approach is equally applicable to other areas. Let's exert that final burst of energy to produce even more spring tea this year!

### 采茶也要精收

    采茶也要精收
    收获小麦、油菜必须收得细致，采摘茶叶同样要采得干净。茶叶漏采，遗留在树上，同把粮食抛撒在地里一样是把眼看到手的财富白白丢掉。茶叶的生长还有一个特点：如果把应采的春茶留在树上，对夏茶生长就很不利。茶叶采不净，不仅减少春茶收成，还会影响夏茶的产量。真是：一时疏忽，两季遭殃。
    浙江省为了弥补春茶采得不净的缺点，已采取紧急措施，突击采制漏采的茶叶。许多茶区目前都在春茶结尾阶段，浙江的作法，同样适用于别的地区。为今年多产春茶加上最后一把劲吧！
