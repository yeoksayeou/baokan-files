"Five-Edged Land" Has Great Potential
    —A Record of the Mass Movement to Eliminate Idle Land in Xinhui County
    By Our Correspondent Li Zuoji
    The mass movement to eliminate idle land is in full swing in Xinhui County, Guangdong Province. While actively managing the early rice fields, the farmers of this county are making use of the mornings, evenings, and rest periods to search for land gaps. They have quickly expanded the planting of sweet potatoes, beans, corn, sorghum, canna edulis, and other miscellaneous grains by more than 35,000 mu, and more than 5,000 mu of rice, striving to expand planting to 80,000 mu.

    Walking into every commune and every production brigade in this county, the scenery of the fields presented to people's eyes is truly colorful. Its appearance has distinct and different characteristics from previous years. On both sides of the crisscrossing drainage ditches surrounding the paddy fields, the farmers have ingeniously planted two straight rows of rice, which from a distance look like two green laces. On the dikes and beside the small roads and ponds, ridges of green beans, black beans, or canna edulis have sprouted and grown leaves. In the villages, the open spaces in front of and behind houses are all planted with various corn, sorghum, and beans. On the small hillsides that were barren in the past, farmers have adopted the method of digging holes and planting sweet potatoes all over. Even under fruit trees such as tangerines and lychees, one can find various miscellaneous grain crops that are growing vigorously.

    The Xinhui County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party believes that miscellaneous grain production is an important aspect of grain production, which can enrich people's lives, provide a large amount of feed for the development of poultry and livestock, and that miscellaneous grains are generally easy to grow and can be planted anywhere. Therefore, before transplanting rice seedlings, the county party committee vigorously promoted the planting of miscellaneous grains, planting more than 100,000 mu of various spring-sown early-maturing miscellaneous grain crops. After the rice transplanting was completed, the county party committee found that there were still a large number of scattered lands such as the sides of dikes, sides of ditches, ends of fields, and in front of and behind houses in various communes that were still not being utilized. It then called on all farmers in the county to "plant wherever there is land, and compete for every inch of land," and to carry out a mass movement of "one person planting one dan of miscellaneous grains" while focusing on the management of early rice fields. The county party committee also stipulated that larger plots of land should be planted by the production team, and scattered plots of land should be planted by the commune members. The harvest is to be used entirely by themselves. The area of expansion in this regard will not increase the grain purchase task or deduct food ration quotas.

    The communes and production brigades have successively conducted surveys and plans for the "five-edged land," and quickly distributed the planting tasks to each team and commune member. After an on-site survey, the Baimiao Brigade of the Siqian Commune found that there were a total of 680 mu of vacant land on the sides of mountains, houses, roads, small rivers, and field foundations. If sweet potatoes, beans, corn, and other crops were planted, the yield of miscellaneous grains could be increased by more than 900,000 jin. The commune members braved the rain to rush to plant. The Zhoulang Brigade of the Gujing Commune mobilized commune members to plan land that could expand the planting of rice and miscellaneous grains, including 50 mu along small rivers, 4,710 zhang along large dikes, and 105 mu in front of and behind houses. After these lands were distributed to teams and commune members, they were immediately planted with various miscellaneous grains. Many commune members, after returning from work in the evening, continued to enclose gardens, hoe the ground, and sow seeds on these scattered lands, until late at night. Cadres of all production brigades in the county took the lead in expanding the planting of miscellaneous grains, so the planting was done very quickly. Cadres and commune members of five brigades of the Tangxia Commune spent several evenings together planting 1,500 mu of beans and 75,000 canna edulis.

    “五边地”大有可为
    ——记新会县消灭空闲地的群众性活动
    本报记者  黎作骥
    消灭空闲地的群众性活动，在广东省新会县搞得热火朝天。这个县的农民在积极做好早稻田间管理的前提下，利用早晨、晚间和休息的时间，四出寻找隙地，很快便扩种了三万五千多亩番薯、豆类、玉米、高粱、蕉芋等各种杂粮和五千多亩水稻，并争取扩种到八万亩。
    走到这个县的每一个公社、每一个生产大队，显现在人们眼前的田野景色真是多姿多彩。它的容貌和往年有着鲜明的不同的特色。在纵横交错的围绕着稻田的排灌水沟两旁，农民们别出心裁地多种下两行笔直的水稻，远远望去，就像镶了两条绿色的花边。在堤围上和小路、池塘旁边，一坎一坎的绿豆、黑豆或蕉芋已经吐芽长叶。村子里屋前屋后的空地上，都长着的各种玉米、高粱和豆类。在往日是荒废的小山坡上，农民们采取打穴的办法，种满了番薯。甚至在柑桔、荔枝等果树下，人们也可以发现各种杂粮作物，正在茁壮地生长。
    中共新会县委认为，杂粮生产是粮食生产的一个重要方面，它能够使人民生活更加丰富，为发展禽畜业提供大量饲料，而且杂粮一般比较粗生，随处可种。因此在插秧前，县委即大抓种植杂粮工作，种下各种春种早熟杂粮作物约十万多亩。插秧结束以后，县委又发现各公社还有大量的围堤边、水沟边、田头田尾、屋前屋后等零星土地仍然没有利用起来，便号召全县农民“有地必种，寸土必争”，在抓好早稻田间管理的同时，开展“一人种一担杂粮”的群众运动。县委还规定，较大块的土地归小队种，零星的土地归社员种，收获物全由自己支配使用，属于这方面扩种的面积不增加购粮任务，不扣减口粮指标。
    各公社、各生产大队便纷纷对“五边地”进行调查和规划，并把种植的任务迅速地分配给各个小队和社员。司前公社白庙大队经过实地勘查后，查出在山边、屋边、路边、小河边、田基边等处的空闲地共有六百八十亩，如果种上番薯、豆类、玉米等作物，可以增收杂粮九十多万斤，社员们就冒雨抢种。古井公社洲朗大队发动社员规划出能扩种水稻和杂粮的土地有小河边五十亩，大围堤四千七百一十丈，屋前屋后地一百零五亩。这些土地分给小队和社员后，一下子便全部种上各种杂粮，许多社员傍晚收工回来，还在这些零星土地上进行围园、锄地、下种，一直搞到晚上。全县各生产大队的干部都带头扩种杂粮，因此种得很快。棠下公社五个大队的干部和社员一起，使用几个晚上的时间，便种下豆类一千五百亩，蕉芋七万五千棵。
