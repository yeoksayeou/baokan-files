    Collective Farm Public Accumulation Funds Continuously Grow, Production Ties are Expanding
    Soviet Collective Farms are Approaching Ownership by the Whole People
    The economic integration between collective farms enables them to solve many production and cultural-life projects that one farm's strength simply cannot build, or would take a long time to build; these are essentially projects with national characteristics. The increasing socialization of labor has begun to transcend the boundaries of individual, even large, collective farms.
    Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 29th: Our correspondent reports: In recent years, the public accumulation funds of Soviet collective farms have been continuously growing, and the production ties between collective farms are further expanding and strengthening. These are creating conditions for the gradual approach of collective farm ownership to ownership by the whole people.
    The collective farm public accumulation fund is the foundation for further developing the collective farm's productive forces. Soviet scholars believe that the gradual approach of collective farm ownership to ownership by the whole people mainly relies on continuously expanding the public accumulation fund and changing its composition. Due to the rapid development of agricultural production and the continuous increase in collective farm income, the collective farm public accumulation fund has seen a huge increase. According to statistics, by the end of 1957, the collective farm public accumulation fund had reached 102 billion rubles, an increase of 97.3 billion rubles compared to 1932, and an increase of 27.6 billion rubles compared to 1940. From 1932 to 1957, the average public accumulation fund of each collective farm increased from 22,000 rubles to 1,338,000 rubles, an increase of dozens of times.
    With the increase in the amount of the public accumulation fund, the composition of the fund has also changed. Now, the public accumulation fund accounts for 82% of the total public funds of the collective farm. At the same time, the proportion of divisible funds (shares) in the total public funds has dropped sharply, falling from 13.6% in 1953 to 2.1% in 1957. The collective farm's ever-growing public accumulation fund can not only be used for the construction of productive buildings and the purchase of agricultural machinery and livestock, but also increasingly for the construction of various cultural and living facilities, such as kindergartens, nurseries, schools, clubs, hospitals and sanatoriums, etc. In the past, these undertakings required the state to handle them. In the early stages of the establishment of collective farms, due to the relatively small public accumulation fund, the farm implements and productive buildings used were relatively simple and crude. Now, collective farms have modern agricultural machinery, tools, engines, automobiles, power stations, mechanized livestock farms, and supporting enterprises equipped with new technologies, as well as complete buildings for production and cultural life.
    It should be particularly pointed out that the measures implemented in 1958 to reorganize machine tractor stations and further consolidate the collective farm system are of great significance for increasing and giving play to the role of the public accumulation fund. Until recently, about four-fifths of the collective farms in the Soviet Union had purchased a large number of tractors, combine harvesters and other agricultural machines, with a total value of more than 21 billion rubles.
    It is noted that Soviet collective farms are constantly accumulating public accumulation funds (in monetary form) through agricultural banks. This makes it possible to economically strengthen the state's guiding role in the use of public accumulation funds by collective farms. Agricultural banks can redistribute funds among collective farms and across the country through long-term loans, which in effect means that the level of public ownership of collective farm public accumulation funds has been further increased.
    Life itself has presented collective farms with the best way to use a portion of the wealth in the public accumulation fund for farm construction work – various enterprises jointly run by collective farms, and the establishment of production ties between collective farms. The method of this connection is: collective farms establish construction organizations on the principle of shareholding, establish enterprises producing local building materials, agricultural product processing plants, and construct hydropower stations, roads, and irrigation canals, etc. At present, the scale of this connection and cooperation is becoming more and more extensive, and the content is becoming richer and richer. The Ukrainian Republic has a total of 600 construction and building material production institutions jointly run by collective farms, which unite more than 70% of the collective farms in the republic and completed construction projects worth 800 million rubles in 1958. The scale of the construction institutions of collective farms in Belarus and other allied republics is also quite considerable. Many collective farms have jointly established flax processing plants, pottery factories, flour mills or oil mills, etc. At the beginning of this year, there were 748 power stations and 1,200 collective farm construction institutions jointly funded by collective farms across the Soviet Union, with nearly 11,000 collective farms participating in these institutions. In addition, there are 425 enterprises producing building materials jointly run by farms, with approximately 4,000 collective farms investing in these enterprises. This economic integration between collective farms enables them to solve many production and cultural-life projects that one farm's strength simply cannot build, or would take a long time to build; these are essentially projects with national characteristics. According to Soviet scholars, this connection proves that the increasing socialization of labor has begun to transcend the boundaries of individual, even large, collective farms. It is believed that the expansion and consolidation of production ties and cooperation between farms increasingly strengthens the production planning of collective farms, making collective farm ownership increasingly closer to ownership by the whole people.

    农庄公积金不断增长　生产联系正日益扩大
    苏联集体农庄正向全民所有制接近
    农庄间的经济上的结合，使得它们能够解决一个农庄的力量根本不能建设或者需要长时期才能建设的许多生产上和文化生活上的工程，这些实质上是具有全民性的工程。日益增长的劳动社会化已经开始超越个别的甚至是巨大的集体农庄的界限。
    新华社莫斯科29日电　本社记者报道：最近几年来，苏联集体农庄公积金不断增长，集体农庄之间的生产联系也在进一步扩大和加强。这些正在为集体农庄所有制逐步接近全民所有制创造着条件。
    集体农庄公积金是进一步发展集体农庄生产力的基础。苏联学者认为，集体农庄所有制同全民所有制逐步接近，主要是依靠不断扩大公积金，改变公积金的组成内容。由于农业生产的急剧发展和集体农庄收入的不断提高，集体农庄公积金有了巨大的增长。据统计，到1957年年底，集体农庄公积金已达到一千零二十亿卢布，比1932年增加了九百七十三亿卢布，比1940年增加了二百七十六亿卢布。从1932年到1957年，平均每个集体农庄的公积金由二万二千卢布增加到一百三十三万八千卢布，即增加了几十倍。
    随着公积金数量的增加，公积金的组成内容也发生了变化。现在，公积金已经占集体农庄全部公共资金的82％。与此同时，可分部分的资金（股金）在全部公共资金中所占的比重急剧下降了，1957年就从1953年的13.6％下降到2.1％。集体农庄日益增长的公积金不仅可以用作建设生产性建筑物、购置农业机器和牲畜的费用，同时也越来越多地用于兴办各种文化生活建筑事业，如幼儿园、托儿所、学校、俱乐部、医院和休养所等等。而在以前，这些事业都需要国家来办。在集体农庄建立的初期，由于公积金比较少，因此，农庄所使用的农具和生产性建筑，都比较简单和简陋。现在，集体农庄拥有现代化的农业机器、工具、发动机、汽车、电力站、机械化的畜牧场和装备有新技术的附属企业，以及生产和文化生活用的完备的建筑物等。
    特别应当指出的是，1958年实行的改组机器拖拉机站和进一步巩固集体农庄制度的措施，对于增加和发挥公积金的作用具有重大的意义。到最近为止，全苏联已经有五分之四左右的集体农庄购买了大量的拖拉机联合收割机和其他农业机器，总值超过二百一十亿卢布。
    人们注意到，苏联集体农庄是通过农业银行来不断积累（货币形式的）公积金的。这就有可能从经济上加强国家在集体农庄使用公积金方面的指导作用。农业银行可以用长期贷款的办法把资金在各集体农庄和全国各地区之间进行再分配，这实际上意味着集体农庄公积金公有化水平进一步提高了。
    生活本身向集体农庄提出了最好地使用公积金中的一部分财富，来进行农庄建设工作的道路　　各集体农庄合办各种企业，建立集体农庄之间的生产联系。这种联系的方法是：各集体农庄以入股原则成立建筑机构，建立生产地方建筑材料的企业、农产品加工厂，建设水电站、道路和灌溉渠等。目前，这种联系和合作的规模越来越广泛，内容也越来越丰富。乌克兰共和国共有六百个由各集体农庄合办的建筑和生产建筑材料的机构，它们联合了全共和国70％以上的集体农庄，在1958年共完成了价值为八亿卢布的建筑工程项目。白俄罗斯以及其它加盟共和国集体农庄的建筑机构的规模也颇为可观。许多集体农庄合办了亚麻加工厂、陶器制造厂、制粉厂或制油厂等。今年年初，全苏联共有七百四十八个由集体农庄集资合办的发电站和一千二百个集体农庄建筑机构，参加这些机构的有近一万一千个集体农庄。此外，还有四百二十五个由农庄合办的生产建筑材料的企业，这些企业的投资者是大约四千个集体农庄。集体农庄之间这种经济上的结合，使得它们能够解决一个农庄的力量根本不能建设、或者需要长时期才能建设的许多生产上和文化生活上的工程，这些实质是具有全民性的工程。按照苏联学者的意见，这种联系证明了，日益增长的劳动社会化已经开始超越个别的、甚至是巨大的集体农庄的界限。人们认为，农庄之间生产联系和合作的扩大和巩固，越来越加强集体农庄的生产计划性，使集体农庄所有制日趋接近全民所有制。（附图片）
