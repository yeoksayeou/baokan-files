    Tattooed Exile
    Liu Mianzhi

    In *Water Margin*, Liangshan heroes like Song Jiang, Lin Chong, and Wu Song were all subjected to the tattooed exile punishment by the Song Dynasty government, receiving twenty or forty strokes of the spine and being exiled two or three thousand *li* to a distant garrison city. Even the officers Dong Chao and Xue Ba, who escorted Lin Chong to Cangzhou, were, because they failed to kill Lin Chong on the way, found some pretext by Gao Qiu to be tattooed and exiled to Daming Prefecture upon their return to Kaifeng. *Water Margin*, chapter eight, states: "In the Song Dynasty, all criminals who were sentenced to penal servitude, exile, or relocation had characters tattooed on their faces. For fear of resentment, it was euphemistically called 'stamping gold.'" A person who committed a crime (or was falsely accused of a crime) was not only beaten and exiled but also had characters tattooed on their face. This was "a single person, a single crime, suffering three punishments simultaneously" (Qiu Jun, *Supplement to the Great Learning*). Combining these three punishments was unprecedented before the Song Dynasty.

    In ancient times, criminal law was generally divided into five categories: death, exile, penal servitude, caning, and flogging.

    Ma Duanlin's *Comprehensive Examination of Literature*, volume 168, states: "Exile, according to the old system, was limited to distant relocation, without tattooing the face. The method of tattooing the face was first created during the Tianfu era of the Jin Dynasty, and it became a severe measure to curb wrongdoing. The Song Dynasty followed this method." It turns out that the Song Dynasty inherited the practice of tattooing criminals' faces from Shi Jingtang's Jin Dynasty.

    Facial tattoos were divided into large and small. If the judge believed that the circumstances of the crime were serious and the criminal's "temperament was ferocious," the characters were tattooed particularly large. In addition to "exiled to a certain prefecture (or government) garrison city," as mentioned in *Water Margin*, the crime committed, the name of the place of exile, the name of the army, and the type of service were also tattooed on the face. For example, tattooing "assigned to a certain prefecture (or government) garrison army for heavy labor" meant being sent to that garrison unit to perform labor; tattooing "Dragon Cavalry Commander" or "Dragon Brave Commander" meant being sent to that type of army to serve as a soldier; tattooing "a certain prefecture, a certain county coin mint" meant being sent to that coin mint to work as a coolie. During the Southern Song Dynasty, there was an even more barbaric regulation that anyone convicted of robbery who was spared the death penalty and exiled would have the words "robber" tattooed on their forehead, with the remaining characters tattooed on both cheeks (Song Hui Yao, 168, Criminal Law 4).

    People subjected to tattooed exile had to perform labor service upon arrival at their place of exile. There were many types of labor service. All state-run industries (such as salt production, wine and vinegar making, brick making, mining, and military equipment manufacturing), transportation, and construction of city walls and river dikes used exiled people to do hard labor. Some also served as Xiang soldiers (mainly also labor) or as sailors (Song Dynasty soldiers were all recruited, and those who passed the examination were also tattooed). Therefore, Song Jiang, Wu Song, and Yang Zhi were all scolded as "thieving exiled soldiers."

    The law of tattooed exile became increasingly severe during the three hundred years of Song Dynasty rule. The number of edicts related to tattooed exile increased from only forty-six during the Xiangfu era (1008-1014 AD) of Emperor Zhenzong of Song to over one hundred and seventy during the Qingli era (1041-1048 AD) of Emperor Renzong of Song, and to as many as five hundred and seventy by the eleventh year of the Chunxi era of Emperor Xiaozong of the Southern Song Dynasty. The scope of tattooed exile became wider and wider. In addition to people like Song Jiang and Wu Song who were subject to tattooed exile, the law stipulated that anyone who committed theft of one string of cash or more, or trafficked in one catty of smuggled salt or more, would be caned and tattooed for exile. Tenants who caught one and a half catties of fish in the landlord's pond, or who saw others trafficking in smuggled salt and did not report it, would also be caned, tattooed, and transported from Fujian to Kaifeng for sentencing (*Comprehensive Examination of Literature*, volume 168). Conversely, the law stipulated that landlords who committed crimes against tenants would have their sentences reduced by one degree compared to ordinary people. Landlords who beat tenants to death would not be tattooed, but only exiled to neighboring prefectures (*Comprehensive Examination of Literature*, volume 167).

    The law of tattooed exile existed in the Liao, Jin, Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties, but the specific provisions were not entirely the same (Continued *Comprehensive Examination of Literature*, volumes 135 and 137, Qing Dynasty Continued *Comprehensive Examination of Literature*, volume 244).

    After the second year of the Xining era (1069 AD) of Emperor Shenzong of the Song Dynasty, the law of caning and tattooing was no longer applicable to "mandarins." "Mandarin" officials who embezzled and perverted the law were only exiled, without being caned or tattooed. The reason given was that "in ancient times, punishment did not extend to high officials." "Now, punishment is for servants and underlings, lest it defile the robes and hats." (*Comprehensive Examination of Literature*, volume 167) Thus, the scope of application was limited to humiliating and suppressing the people, especially tenants and impoverished people who offended the interests of the landlord class.

    刺配
    刘勉之
    水浒传里梁山泊头领宋江、林冲、武松等都被宋朝政府处过刺配的刑罚，挨脊杖二十或四十，刺配二、三千里外牢城。连原来押解林冲去沧州的差人董超、薛霸，因为路上没有能够害死林冲，回开封后也被高俅寻事刺配大名府。水浒传第八回说：“原来宋时，但是犯人，徒流迁徙的，都脸上刺字。怕人恨怪，只唤做打金印。”一个人犯了法（或被诬陷以法），既要挨打，又要流配，还要在脸上刺字，正是“一人之身，一事之犯，而兼受三刑”，（丘浚“大学衍义补”。）三种刑罚连在一起用，在宋以前是没有的。
    古时刑法大致分为死、流、徒、杖、笞五等。
    马端临文献通考卷一百六十八说：“流配，旧制止于远徙，不刺面。晋天福中始创刺面之法，遂为戢奸重典。宋因其法。”原来宋代把犯人脸上刺字这种法律是从石敬塘的晋朝继承而来的。
    刺面有大刺、小刺之别。凡是审判官认为犯罪情节严重、犯人“性情凶恶”的，就把字体特别刺大些。所刺文字，除水浒所说“迭配某州（府）牢城”以外，也有把所犯事由，所配地名、军名、服役名色都刺在脸上的。如刺“配某州（府）屯驻军重役”，是发往该处屯驻部队里服劳役的；刺“龙骑指挥”或“龙猛指挥”，是发到那种番号的军队中当兵的；刺“某州某县钱监”，是发到该处铸钱工厂里当苦工的。南宋时还有一种更野蛮的规定，凡犯强盗罪免死流配的，“额上刺强盗二字，余字分刺两脸”，（宋会要一百六十八刑法四。）
    受到刺配刑罚的人，到配所后还得服劳役。劳役的名色很多。凡是官营工业（如煮盐，造酒、醋，烧窑，开矿，修造军械等）、交通运输业以及修城修河堤等，都发流配人去做苦工。也有当厢军（主要也是劳役）当水军的。（宋朝的兵都由招募而来，经检验合格后，也要刺面。）所以宋江、武松、杨志都被人骂为“贼配军”。
    刺配这条法律，在宋朝统治的三百年间是愈来愈重的。有关刺配的法令，宋真宗祥符（公元1008年—1014年）编敕止有四十六条，到宋仁宗庆历（1041年—1048年）时增至一百七十余条，到南宋孝宗淳熙十一年已达五百七十条之多。刺配的范围越来越广，除了像宋江、武松那样要刺配以外，法律规定犯窃盗罪一贯以上，贩私盐一斤以上的都要杖脊刺配。佃户在地主池塘里捕了一斤半鱼，或者看见别人贩私盐不告发，也要脊杖刺面，还从福建押送开封判罪，（通考卷一百六十八。）反之，法律又规定地主对佃户犯罪，减凡人一等。地主打死佃户，不刺面，止配邻州近地。（通考卷一百六十七。）
    刺配的法律，辽、金、元、明、清都有。只是内容规定不尽相同，
  （续文献通考卷一百三十五、一百三十七，清朝续文献通考卷二百四十四）
    宋朝这条脊杖，刺面的法律，从宋神宗熙宁二年（1069年）以后，对“命官”就不适用了。“命官”贪赃枉法，止于流配，不杖脊，不刺面。据说理由是“古者刑不上大夫”。“今刑为徒隶，恐污辱衣冠耳。”
  （通考卷一百六十七）这样，适用的范围就止限于污辱和镇压人民，特别是冒犯地主阶级利益的佃农和饥寒交迫的穷人了。
