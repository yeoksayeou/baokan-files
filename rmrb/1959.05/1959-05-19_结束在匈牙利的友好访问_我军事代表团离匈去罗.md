Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, 18th: The Chinese military goodwill delegation headed by Peng Dehuai, Vice Premier of the State Council and Minister of National Defense, left Budapest by train on the evening of the 17th for a visit to Romania.

Those who saw the delegation off at the station included Marosan Gyorgyi, member of the Political Bureau and Secretary of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Hungarian socialist workers party, bisku bela, member of the Political Bureau and Minister of Internal Affairs, Defense Minister Revész Géza, and senior generals of the People's Army.

Xie Feng, Charge d'Affaires ad interim of the Chinese Embassy in Hungary, military attache Hu Binpu, and diplomatic envoys and military attaches of various countries in Hungary also went to the station to see them off.

Marshal Peng Dehuai, accompanied by Minister Revész, reviewed the guard of honor.

Marshal Peng Dehuai expressed his gratitude again at parting for the warm hospitality extended to our military goodwill delegation during its visit to Hungary.

Marshal Peng Dehuai said that under the leadership of the Socialist Workers' Party headed by Comrade Kádár, the Hungarian working people have not only rapidly healed the wounds caused by the counter-revolutionary riots, but also enabled Hungary's socialist construction to develop more rapidly. Our close comrades-in-arms, the Hungarian People's Army, has also been tempered to be stronger, and is vigilantly guarding the security of the motherland, and together with the armies of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, is safeguarding peace in Europe and the world.

Marshal Peng Dehuai finally said that the people and armies of China and Hungary are close brothers, and common ideals and common cause unite us firmly together. We are deeply convinced that the friendship between us will be increasingly consolidated and developed day by day.

Minister Revész said in his farewell speech that the visit of the Chinese military goodwill delegation to Hungary has made a significant contribution to the development of brotherly cooperation and friendship between the people of our two countries and to the strengthening of the fighting friendship between the two armies. He said that all officers and soldiers of the Hungarian People's Army are even more convinced that the firm and unbreakable proletarian internationalist unity of the Soviet Union, China, and the armies of the socialist camp is the most important guarantee for building socialism and communism and defending peace.
