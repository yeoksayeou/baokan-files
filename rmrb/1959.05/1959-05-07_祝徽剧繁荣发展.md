　　Wishing Huiju a Flourishing Future
　　Hu Sha
　　Huiju is an ancient and outstanding opera genre that once nurtured the growth of the renowned Peking Opera art, both domestically and internationally. Under its influence, a series of exceptional performing artists emerged, from Cheng Changgeng and Tan Xinpei to Mei Lanfang, bringing China's opera performing arts to their peak. Therefore, our concern for this opera genre is quite natural.

　　There was a time when we thought that Huiju would only be a historical term, and we would hardly be able to see its appearance on the stage again, because it had disappeared for many years. A few years ago, we heard that the Anhui Provincial Cultural Bureau had tried every means to find a few seeds of Huiju, that is, old artists over sixty years old. Later, we heard about cultivating the descendants of Huiju. Today, these inheritors of Huiju art have appeared before our eyes and touched us with their quaint and simple art. This makes us first express our gratitude to the Party and the government of Anhui for giving Huiju a new life.

　　The young Huiju actors who came to Beijing this time do have excellent performing talents, just like their predecessors. Their performance of "Yu Ni River" gave me a good impression.

　　"Yu Ni River" is the story of "Luo Cheng Calling at the Pass." However, it is not quite the same as the Peking Opera version. This is a martial arts performance with equal emphasis on singing and acting. The main aria of this play (that is, one of the main tunes of Huiju, the Bo Zi tune), is what is commonly known as the Gao Bo Zi. The Peking Opera Bo Zi tune tends to be high-pitched, enthusiastic and gorgeous, while the Huiju Bo Zi tune has simple, vigorous and tragic colors, which sounds particularly moving.

　　It is not easy for a martial arts performance to be both excellent in singing and acting. I can see that Huiju's "Yu Ni River" not only pays attention to singing and acting, but also focuses on portraying the psychology of the hero Luo Cheng, so this play has an internal moving power, which is an important reason why our emotions are stirred after watching it.

　　This play is very successful in depicting Luo Cheng's heroic character. The play has three acts in total. The first act depicts Luo Cheng returning after defeating the enemy. The commander Yuan Ji intends to harm him. Not only is there no reward, but he is beaten with forty military sticks, leaving him with lacerated skin. He is then ordered to go out again to retrieve the enemy's head. Luo Cheng asks Yuan Ji to send some troops, but Yuan Ji refuses and urges him to fight alone. In the second act, Luo Cheng fights the enemy alone, inflicting heavy casualties. Finally, he is defeated under the city. However, Yuan Ji closes the four gates tightly. Only Luo Cheng's son, Luo Chun, watches his father from the city tower with a red lantern in his hand. Luo Cheng knows that Yuan Ji wants to kill him, so he tears off his clothes, bites his middle finger, and writes a letter to Qin Qiong and Cheng Yaojin by the light of his son's red lantern, hoping that they will send troops to rescue him. Luo Cheng throws the letter to his son, turns around and fights the enemy again. Although Luo Cheng is seriously injured, he still injures several enemy generals, with a very fierce momentum.

　　The enemy sees that they cannot kill him, so they lure him to the Yu Ni River. Luo Cheng's war horse gets stuck in the mud and cannot escape. The enemy shoots him with a volley of arrows, and he uses his spear to deflect the arrows. When Luo Cheng uses his spear to support his body and pull himself out of the mud, the spear is lost. The enemy persuades him to surrender and become a king together. Luo Cheng does not accept the enemy's temptation and commits suicide in the Yu Ni River. His heroic spirit greatly moves the enemy.

　　Obviously, this is not an easy play to perform. However, the thirteen-year-old child actor Zhang Qixiang successfully completed this important task. Zhang Qixiang's voice is clear and good at conveying emotions. The long aria of "writing a letter" under the city is very moving; when fighting with many enemies, his spear trembles, indicating the anxious state of being outnumbered; the gasps between battles show Luo Cheng's perseverance to fight despite his serious injuries.

　　It is said that young Zhang Qixiang also plays Guan Yu in "Flooding the Seven Armies," and is also good at portraying Guan Yu's subtle psychology, but unfortunately I have not had the opportunity to see it. And this young actor's career is only one and a half years old. Obviously, he can achieve such results, first of all, because the old teachers taught him well. We thank the efforts of the old Huiju teachers.

　　We warmly hope that the Huiju teenagers will learn the art of the old teachers seriously, bit by bit, so that the Huiju art will bloom more brightly in the garden of Chinese opera. I wish the young Huiju actors a healthy growth.

　　祝徽剧繁荣发展

    徽剧是个古老的优秀剧种，她曾经哺育了当代名震中外的京剧艺术的成长。在她的影响下，出现了从程长庚、谭鑫培到梅兰芳等一系列的卓越的表演艺术家，使我国戏曲表演艺术达到了高峰。因此，我们对这个剧种的关怀是很自然的。
    有一个时期，我们以为徽剧将只是一个历史上的名词了，我们再难得从舞台上见到她的面貌，因为多少年来，她已经消声匿迹。前几年，我们又听说安徽省文化局千方百计的寻找到了几颗徽剧的种子，也就是年过花甲的老艺人。后来又听说在培养徽剧的后代。今天，这些徽剧艺术的继承者们却已出现在我们眼前，并以他们古色古香的、淳朴的艺术打动了我们。这使我们首先要向安徽的党和政府表示感谢，感谢他们使徽剧获得了新的生命。
    这次来京的徽剧少年演员们，的确像他们的前辈一样，有着优秀的表演才能。他们演出的“淤泥河”给了我良好的印象。
    “淤泥河”也就是“罗成叫关”的故事。不过和京戏的路子不大一样。这是一出唱做并重的武生戏。这出戏的主要唱腔（即是徽剧的主要腔调之一的拨子），也就是通常所说的高拨子。京剧拨子倾向于高亢热情华丽，徽剧拨子却有淳朴苍劲悲凉的色彩，听起来特别动人。
    武生戏唱做兼优是不易的，我看出徽剧“淤泥河”除了注意唱做外，更着力于对英雄罗成的心理的刻划，因此使这出戏具有了内在的感人力量，也就是我们看了之后为何情感受到激动的重要原因。
    这出戏在描写罗成的英雄性格上是很成功的。这个戏一共三场。头一场描写罗成战败敌人归来，主帅元吉有害他之意，不单无赏，反而打了四十军棍，打得皮开肉绽，又命他再次出征取回敌人的首级。罗成要求元吉派些人马，元吉不允，促他只身出战。第二场罗成只身与敌军大战，杀伤敌人甚重，终因寡不敌众，败到城下，元吉却将四门紧闭，只有罗成的儿子罗春在城楼手执红灯探望爹爹。罗成知道元吉要害他一死，只得撕下衣襟，咬破中指，借着儿子的红灯，给秦琼和程咬金修书，盼他们派兵来援救。罗成将书信扔给了自己的儿子，反过身来又和敌人战斗。罗成虽然身受重伤，仍然损伤了敌人的数员大将，气势十分凶猛。
    敌人见杀不过他，将他诱到淤泥河。罗成的战马陷入淤泥不得脱身，敌人又用乱箭射他，他用枪拨开了乱箭。当罗成用枪支持身子拔出淤泥时，枪又失落了，敌人劝他归降共同为王，罗成不受敌人的引诱，自刎而死于淤泥河。他的英雄气概，使敌人也受到了极大的感动。
    很明显，这是一出不好演的戏。可是十三岁的童伶章其祥却胜任的完成了这个重任。章其祥的嗓音清亮善于传情。在城下“修书”那一大段唱工很能动人；和众多的敌人战斗时，他的枪头颤动，表示了寡不敌众的焦急心理；战斗间隙的喘息，表现了罗成身带重伤坚持战斗的毅力。
    据说章其祥小朋友在“水淹七军”中扮演关羽，也以刻划关羽的细微的心理见长，可惜我还没有机会看到。而这个少年演员的艺龄才只有一年半。很明显，他能够取得这样的成绩，首先是老师父们教得好。我们感谢徽剧的老师父们的努力。
    我们热望徽剧少年们将老师父的艺术认真地一点一滴的学过来，使徽剧艺术在祖国的戏曲大花园中开得更鲜艳。祝徽剧少年演员健康成长。
