According to a report in the Shandong Dazhong Daily: In carrying out the fertilizer accumulation campaign, Sishui County's Chengguan People's Commune, while strengthening political work, conscientiously implemented the principle of more pay for more work, greatly encouraging the enthusiasm of the broad masses of commune members.

When checking the quality of spring sowing in mid-April, the commune discovered a rather serious shortage of fertilizer. The Management Committee immediately stipulated four specific measures to solve this problem. These four measures are: ① Reasonable evaluation of the fertilizer previously invested in the commune and teams by commune members, and payment in cash. All twenty-four production teams in the commune are carrying out this work. For the part of the fertilizer invested by commune members that cannot be paid for temporarily, the production team and commune members sign a contract to be paid off in the summer and autumn seasons. ② For livestock raised collectively by the commune and teams, specific fertilizer accumulation tasks are stipulated based on the labor strength of the breeding personnel, the size of the livestock, the quality of the forage, and the distance of the garbage source used for filling the pens. Each head of livestock accumulates 2,000 to 7,000 jin of fertilizer per month (an average of 4,000 jin). Each pig accumulates an average of 2,000 jin of fertilizer per month. Those who exceed the set quota will be awarded work points according to the amount of the excess. ③ The fertilizer accumulation professional teams organized by the commune and teams (including manure managers) are assigned areas of responsibility based on the number of households, the number of people, and the number of toilets. Tasks and work points are set, with bonuses for exceeding the quota. For example, those responsible for collecting manure from government offices are required to accumulate 400 jin of night soil per person per day; those who collect manure are required to collect 60 to 80 jin per person per day; and those who make native chemical fertilizer are required to produce 100 to 600 jin per person per day. In terms of labor remuneration, a method of fixed work points with flexible evaluation is adopted. Those who complete the set task are given work points according to the regulations; those who fail to complete the set task have their work points deducted proportionally; and those who exceed the set quota are awarded work points in different grades according to the excess situation. Accounts are cleared and settled once a month, and evaluations and awards are given twice a year. ④ In order to further stimulate the enthusiasm of commune members in accumulating fertilizer, the production team adopts a method of paying deposits in advance for the fertilizer accumulated by commune members. 20% to 30% of the cash is prepaid to commune members based on each household's fertilizer accumulation plan as a deposit for the purchase of fertilizer. The remaining portion is paid in the summer and autumn seasons based on the actual fertilizer accumulation. In addition, reasonable prices are stipulated according to the quality of various fertilizers. Pen manure is divided into three grades, with prices ranging from one yuan and one jiao to one yuan and five jiao per thousand jin. Night soil is divided into dry and fresh grades, with prices ranging from eight jiao to two yuan and two jiao per hundred jin. Seven thousand to thirteen thousand jin of miscellaneous soil fertilizer is equivalent to ten work points.

After these four regulations were implemented, they were supported by the broad masses of commune members, who unanimously reflected that "with this method, there is a guarantee that there will be no shortage of fertilizer." After hearing about the fertilizer remuneration method, old commune member Tian Zhongsheng from Chengbei Brigade built four new toilets in a row and accumulated 1,200 jin of fertilizer in seven days. All 550 elderly people in the commune participated in fertilizer accumulation activities. Many commune members immediately took action after formulating family fertilizer accumulation plans. A total of 5,240 male and female commune members, young and old, participated in fertilizer accumulation (including 450 people participating in the fertilizer accumulation professional team). In less than a month, the entire commune has accumulated more than 70 million jin of various fertilizers. The various native chemical fertilizer plants restored and newly built by the production teams number 116, producing 9.15 million jin of various native chemical fertilizers. At the same time, a method of accumulating and transporting fertilizer simultaneously was adopted, and 50 million jin of fertilizer have already been transported to the fields. In this way, the problem of fertilizer shortage for spring sown crops has been basically solved, and the fertilizer accumulation work has begun to be regularized.

    积肥定酬　超额给奖
    泗水城关公社春播作物缺肥问题基本解决
    据山东大众日报报道　泗水县城关人民公社在开展积肥运动中，在加强政治工作的同时，认真贯彻执行多劳多得的原则，大大鼓舞了广大社员的积极性。
    这个公社在4月中旬检查春播质量时，发现肥料不足现象相当严重。管委会立即规定了四项具体办法，来解决这个问题。这四项办法是：①对社员以前向社、队投资的肥料，进行合理评价，付给现款。全社二十四个生产队正在进行这项工作。社员投资的肥料暂时不能付给报酬的部分，由生产队和社员签订合同，分夏、秋两季还清。②社、队集体喂养的牲畜，根据饲养人员的劳力强弱、牲畜大小、草料好坏和填圈用的垃圾来源远近，具体规定了积肥任务。每头牲口一个月积肥二千至七千斤（平均四千斤）。每头猪平均一个月积肥二千斤。超额完成定量的，根据超额多少分别奖给工分。③社、队组织的积肥专业队伍（包括粪便管理员），划片包干，根据户数、人数和厕所的多少，定任务、定工分，超额奖励。例如负责收拾机关粪便的，规定每人每天积大粪四百斤；拾大粪的，规定每人每天六十至八十斤；造土化肥的，规定每人每天一百斤至六百斤。在劳动报酬上，采取死分活评的办法，完成定额任务的按规定记工分；未完成定额任务的按照比例扣发工分；超额完成定量的，根据超额情况分等奖给工分，每月清理结账一次，一年两次评比奖励。④为了进一步激发社员积肥的积极性，生产队对社员积的肥料，采取预付定金的办法。根据各户的积肥计划预付给社员20％至30％的现款，作为预购肥料定金，其余部分根据实际积肥情况，分夏、秋两季付款。此外，根据各种肥料的质量，规定了合理价格，圈肥分为三等，每千斤一元一角至一元五角。大粪分干鲜两等，每百斤八角至二元二角。土杂肥七千斤至一万三千斤记十分工。
    这四项规定实行后，得到了广大社员的拥护，一致反映“有了这个办法，肥料保证不缺”。城北大队老社员田中生听了积肥报酬办法后，一连建了四个新厕所，七天积肥一千二百斤。全社五百五十个老年人都参加了积肥活动。不少社员制订出家庭积肥计划后立即行动。参加积肥的男女老少社员有五千二百四十人（其中有四百五十人参加积肥专业队），在不足一个月的时间里，全社已积各种肥料七千余万斤。各生产队恢复和新建的土化肥厂有一百一十六处，生产出各种土化肥九百一十五万斤。同时，采取了边积、边运的办法，运到地里的肥料已有五千万斤。这样，春播作物缺肥问题已经基本解决，并使积肥工作开始经常化。
