    Tibetan Folk Songs
    After a dark night, we see a bright sunny day. The Party uses boundless love to bring happiness to the Tibetan people.
    Exploring the slopes where yaks struggle, we fly past. On the cliffs where goats struggle, we walk as if weaving. If you ask what we are doing, there are many treasures in the mountains.
    Following the Communist Party, birds have the freedom to fly everywhere. The fate of slaves is in the hands of their masters; if you want to be like a bird, you can only follow the Communist Party.

    西藏民歌
    晴天熬过了黑暗的长夜，见到了明朗的晴天，党用无边的慈爱，把幸福带给藏族人民。
    勘探牦牛难走的山坡，我们如飞而过，山羊难走的峭壁，我们步行似穿梭。若问我们干什么，万山丛中宝藏多。
    跟着共产党走鸟儿有到处飞的自由，奴仆的命运握在主人的
  手；要想像鸟儿一样，只有跟着共产党。
