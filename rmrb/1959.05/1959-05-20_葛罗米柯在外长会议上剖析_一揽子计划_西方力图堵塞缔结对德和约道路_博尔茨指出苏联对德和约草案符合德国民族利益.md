Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, 19th. According to TASS, the Foreign Ministers' Conference on the 18th was chaired by Gromyko. The Foreign Minister of the German Democratic Republic, Bolz, spoke first.

    Bolz Speaks
    Bolz pointed out that the delegation of the German Democratic Republic had carefully studied the plan of the three Western powers and the draft peace treaty with Germany proposed by the Soviet government. He said: The government of the German Democratic Republic has stated more than once that, from the perspective of international law, the German people have an indisputable right to a peace treaty. The German people firmly advocate the speedy conclusion of a peace treaty to finally write off the Second World War, establish a solid foundation for lasting peace, enable the German people to obtain the right to self-determination without any restrictions, and normalize the relations between the German people and the peoples of all countries.
    The peace treaty should bring peace and freedom to all Germans. As long as the peace treaty can prevent the West German militarists from dragging the German people into war again, this peace treaty will conform to the above-mentioned purpose.
    In addition, the peace treaty should also solve a series of urgent problems, such as the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Germany, West Germany's withdrawal from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the German Democratic Republic's withdrawal from the Warsaw Treaty Organization, and the elimination of all foreign military bases on German territory.
    Bolz then said that what is more important for the German people is that concluding a peace treaty with Germany is a shortcut to restoring Germany's national unity.
    When further discussing the path to German reunification, Bolz emphasized that the two Germanys are developing along two fundamentally different paths: West Germany is following the path of militarism, while the German Democratic Republic is following the path of anti-militarism. Therefore, it is impossible to mechanically unify Germany. To solve the German question, negotiations between representatives of the two Germanys are indispensable.
    Bolz continued that the issue of German reunification is not within the purview of the Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference.
    Bolz said that the representatives of the German Democratic Republic are still prepared to hold talks with the delegation of the Federal Republic of Germany on a common position on the issue of a peace treaty with Germany. The reunification of Germany is a matter for the German people themselves, and no one can solve this problem for the Germans.
    Bolz further said that concluding a peace treaty is also a good way to solve the West Berlin issue.
    Bolz firmly rejected the Western plan because it not only does not abolish the occupation system in West Berlin, but also expands this system to the entire Berlin. The delegation of the German Democratic Republic believes that even discussing this proposal, which interferes in its internal affairs and undermines its sovereignty and territorial integrity, is impossible.
    He went on to say that the delegation of the German Democratic Republic believes that the Soviet draft peace treaty with Germany and the plan to normalize the situation in West Berlin are plans that, in principle, meet our requirements for ensuring peace and, therefore, also meet the national interests of the German people and the peace aspirations of all European people.

    Herter Speaks
    Following Bolz's speech was Herter's. He gave his opinion on the Soviet draft peace treaty with Germany.
    The US Secretary of State attempted to convince people that the US government attaches great importance to a fair and lasting peace with Germany. He insisted that since the end of the war, the United States has been concerned with making the peace with Germany worthy of the name, so that a free and unified Germany can establish relations with the rest of the world through solemn international guarantees that can ensure world peace.
    Herter avoided mentioning the irrefutable fact that the division of Germany after the war was caused by the actions and policies of the three Western powers. Instead, without evidence and regardless of the facts, he insisted that the responsibility for the failure to conclude a final peace with Germany lies with the Soviet Union.
    When analyzing the Soviet draft peace treaty, Herter stubbornly ignored the fact that there are currently two Germanys and that the task of reunifying Germany is a matter for the German people themselves. Herter insisted that, from a legal point of view, a peace treaty can only be concluded with a unified Germany. However, everyone knows that the United States itself and other Western countries have been creating numerous obstacles to prevent Germany from being reunified on a peaceful and democratic basis.
    Herter finally said that the United States has studied the Soviet draft peace treaty with Germany. He also said that the draft was studied very carefully, hoping that perhaps it could open up a path to a permanent peace with Germany. Herter said that if the Soviet proposal was like this, the United States would welcome it. He said, however, that, on the contrary, this proposal includes factors that may become the cause of future disputes and conflicts.

    Gromyko Speaks
    Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko then spoke.
    Gromyko said that in the proposals submitted to our conference for study by the governments of the United States, Britain, and France, many issues are intertwined with each other. Instead of resolving the contradictions between East and West one by one, the three-country plan entangles these contradictions into a chaotic knot. In the Western proposals, simply making the peace treaty with Germany and the Berlin issue subordinate to German unification makes this plan a fantasy and a plan that only caters to the extremists of the Federal Republic of Germany, who will also resist the possibility of reaching an agreement on issues that have already matured, and will not allow international tensions to ease.
    The Soviet Foreign Minister pointed out that the Western countries clearly knew in advance the Soviet Union's attitude towards studying the issue of restoring a unified Germany at this meeting. However, the three-country phased plan has just placed the issue of a unified Germany at the center again.
    Gromyko pointed out that under the current circumstances, a unified Germany can only emerge through an agreement between the two Germanys, which have already taken the path of independent development for almost ten years. The Soviet government believes that there is no other way, and it is impossible to have another way.
    When talking about the point in the plan that the four major powers should establish an all-German mixed committee, Gromyko emphasized that, of course, the Soviet Union does not object to the idea of establishing an all-German mixed committee. However, this issue should be resolved by the governments of the German Democratic Republic and the Federal Republic of Germany, who can themselves determine the tasks and members of the all-German agency.
    When talking about the remarks made at the meeting regarding the responsibilities of the four major powers for resolving the German issue and reunifying Germany, Gromyko said that the four major powers have certain responsibilities for resolving the German issue. The duty of the four major powers is to guarantee the preparation and conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany. Under the current circumstances, this is also the most effective contribution of the four major powers to the cause of unifying Germany. In addition, the four major powers can promote the rapprochement between the two Germanys and promote an agreement between the two Germanys on the path to reunifying Germany. The Soviet delegation advocates that the corresponding guarantees of the four major powers can be included in the peace treaty or the peace treaty protocol as supplementary clauses or clauses.
    The head of the Soviet delegation continued that after studying the plan proposed by the Western countries, it will be clear that the entire content of the plan, the realization of all the measures proposed in the plan, is in fact subject to a prerequisite: agreeing to all-German elections under the supervision of the four major powers, which makes this plan unrealistic and unfounded. We do not object to elections, but this issue should be resolved by the Germans themselves, and no one has the right to interfere in their internal affairs.
    Gromyko then emphasized that the Soviet government believes that the three-country plan of the West cannot be used as a basis for studying the issues on the meeting's agenda under any circumstances. However, this does not mean that there are no parts in the Western countries' plan that can be taken out for separate study. For example, some parts can be studied in conjunction with the issue of European security or disarmament in the future according to appropriate procedures.
    Gromyko then pointed out that the Soviet government is absolutely not opposed to solving the mature international problems gradually and in stages. But we believe that the task of this meeting is to separate out such issues that have the greatest impact on relations between countries, and it is currently possible to achieve similar views. If we are to divide international issues into stages for resolution, then the peace treaty with Germany and the Berlin issue must be put forward first.
    When talking about the West's attitude towards concluding a peace treaty with Germany, Gromyko said that in their grand plan, which is estimated to take several years to complete, the three Western powers moved the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany to the final stage. Not only that, but the Western countries have also moved out all the obstacles that can be imagined in the current international situation to block the road to concluding a peace treaty with Germany.
    Gromyko reminded people to pay attention to the fact that the three-country document completely avoids talking about the content of the peace treaty with Germany. He said that no matter how many times you read this document, you cannot find a single word that talks about this point.
    The head of the Soviet delegation then pointed out that the specific proposals in the three-country plan are essentially to maintain the current tense situation in Europe, which breeds dangerous consequences. He said that it can be seen from the three-country proposals that they hope that even after the peace treaty is signed, foreign troops and foreign military bases will still remain in Germany, and the duration will not be temporary or limited, but supposedly these troops and bases will be seriously and permanently retained. It can be seen that what is before us is a plan for the permanent occupation of Germany by foreigners.
    Gromyko refuted the claim that the Soviet draft peace treaty was intended to "pull West Germany out of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization." He said that although we believe that it would be beneficial for the two Germanys to withdraw from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Treaty separately, we do not object to the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic remaining in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and the Warsaw Treaty separately for a certain period of time after the peace treaty with Germany is signed.
    Gromyko then talked about the West Berlin issue. He said that the Western three powers' proposals on the Berlin issue are unacceptable from beginning to end. The essence of the three powers' proposals on the Berlin issue is not only to fix the occupation system in West Berlin, but also to expand it to the entire Berlin. The Western countries want to annex the capital of the German Democratic Republic without compromise and place the entire city under foreign control. Their plan is nothing more than an attempt to crudely undermine the basic sovereignty of the German Democratic Republic, which, of course, cannot be allowed.
    The head of the Soviet delegation then analyzed the part of the US, British, and French plan concerning European security. He pointed out that the drafters of the plan took the solution of other issues raised in this plan, especially the issue of German unification, as a prerequisite for achieving any steps in European security. This alone shows that the purpose of the plan is to prevent the establishment of effective European security or the realization of certain partial measures in this area from moving forward. The head of the Soviet delegation said that the main and only purpose of the drafters of the three-country plan is to ensure that they can station troops on German territory as well as on the territory of other European countries.
    Gromyko said that the three-country plan stipulates that any measures related to European security can only be realized after the establishment of an all-German government, that is, only after Germany is unified. This shows that the entire issue of European security raised in the plan is just for show.
    Gromyko said that the Western countries would be doing a good thing if they did not entangle the issue of European security with their other proposals and worked together with the Soviet Union and other relevant countries to establish an effective system of European security. Gromyko said that as for the Soviet Union, it would be very willing to separately discuss any sensible proposals aimed at consolidating European security in an appropriate manner, including certain proposals raised in the three-country plan of the West.
    When talking about the disarmament issue raised in the Western countries' plan, Gromyko said that the Western countries have also made the disarmament issue an inseparable part of this plan, and made the solution of this issue dependent on other issues, especially the issue of German unification. This alone is enough to show that the Western countries do not seem to want to break the deadlock on these issues.
    Gromyko recalled that for a long time, whether it was the entire disarmament issue or its various parts, it had been discussed in the United Nations. The Soviet government had repeatedly proposed suggestions on the prohibition of atomic weapons, substantial reduction of the conventional armaments and armed forces of various countries, etc. The Soviet government has proposed the simultaneous solution of reducing the armed forces and armaments of various countries, prohibiting the use of nuclear weapons and destroying stored nuclear weapons, the separate proposal to prohibit atomic weapons or abandon the use of such weapons, and the proposal to reduce conventional armaments. However, the Western countries did not accept any of these suggestions. In this way, the Western countries have locked themselves in a dead end. The Western countries' current plan makes it more difficult to get out of this dead end. It must be said frankly that it is simply impossible.
    Gromyko continued that after a careful study of the three-country plan, it shows that this plan does not conform to the main tasks of the Foreign Ministers' Conference—preparing for peace with Germany and seeking a mutually agreeable solution to solve the urgent problem of normalizing the situation in West Berlin. The Western plan can only prevent the conference from discussing some issues where real progress is possible. The basis of this plan is essentially the suggestions that the Western countries have put forward in the past. This suggestion is actually nothing more than a "Cold War" plan, a plan that pursues a "position of strength" policy.
    The Soviet delegation expressed satisfaction with the constructive proposals put forward by the Foreign Minister of the German Democratic Republic, Bolz, on the issue of a peace treaty with Germany and the Berlin issue. He said that the plan submitted to us by the Western countries cannot be used as a basis for discussing and formulating mutually acceptable solutions. However, individual clauses and propositions in some parts of the three-country plan are worth discussing if they are studied separately and not included in the deliberately created whole. He said that he was referring to such clauses and propositions, such as the declaration by the four major powers on resolving all international disputes by peaceful means and not providing assistance to aggressors, certain disarmament issues, and the establishment of arms limitation zones. However, he said, our meeting should focus its attention on the two urgent issues of the peace treaty with Germany and West Berlin.

    葛罗米柯在外长会议上剖析“一揽子计划”
    西方力图堵塞缔结对德和约道路
    博尔茨指出苏联对德和约草案符合德国民族利益
    新华社19日讯　据塔斯社日内瓦讯：外长会议18日会议由葛罗米柯担任主席，德意志民主共和国外交部长博尔茨首先发言。
    博尔茨发言
    博尔茨指出，德意志民主共和国代表团已经仔细地研究了西方三国的计划和苏联政府提出的对德和约草案。他说：德意志民主共和国政府已经不止一次地声明，从国际法方面来看，德国人民对于和约有着无可争辩的权利。德国人民坚决主张尽速缔结和约，以便最终勾销第二次世界大战，建立持久和平的巩固基础，使德国人民有可能得到没有任何限制的自决权，使德国人民同各国人民的关系正常化。
    和约应该使所有的德国人得到和平和自由。只要和约能阻止西德军国主义分子重新把德国人民拖入战争，这一和约就符合上述宗旨。
    此外，和约还应该解决一系列急待解决的问题，如一切外国军队撤出德国，西德退出北大西洋公约组织和德意志民主共和国退出华沙条约组织以及消除德国领土上一切外国军事基地等问题。
    博尔茨接着说，对德国人民来说更为重要的是：缔结对德和约是恢复德国国家统一的一条捷径。
    博尔茨在进一步谈到德国重新统一的道路时着重指出，两个德国是沿着两条根本不同的道路发展的：在西德是沿着军国主义道路，而在德意志民主共和国是沿着反军国主义的道路，因此不可能机械地统一德国。要解决全德问题，没有两个德国代表之间的谈判是不可能的。
    博尔茨继续说，德国重新统一问题不属于日内瓦外长会议权限范围之内。
    博尔茨说，德意志民主共和国的代表仍然准备与联邦共和国代表团就德国在和约问题上的共同立场进行会谈。德国的重新统一是德国人民自己的事，没有任何人能够代替德国人解决这一问题。
    博尔茨进一步说，缔结和约也是解决西柏林问题的一条好道路。
    博尔茨坚决拒绝了西方的计划，因为这一计划不但不取消西柏林的占领制度，反而要把这种制度扩大到整个柏林。德意志民主共和国代表团认为，对这个干涉它的内政、破坏它的主权和领土完整的建议，甚至连讨论都是不可能的。
    他接着说，德意志民主共和国代表团认为，苏联提出的对德和约草案以及使西柏林局势正常化的计划，是在原则上符合我们对保证和平的要求、因而也符合德国人民的民族利益以及所有欧洲人民的和平愿望的计划。
    赫脱发言
    继博尔茨发言的是赫脱。他就苏联的对德和约草案发表了意见。
    美国国务卿企图使人相信，美国政府非常重视公正地和持久地同德国媾和。他硬说，从战争结束那个时候起，美国一直关心使同德国的媾和能够名符其实，使自由和统一的德国同世界其他国家能够通过郑重的国际保证建立起可以确保世界和平的关系。
    赫脱避而不谈德国战后的分裂是西方三国的行动和政策所造成的这个确凿的事实，反而毫无证据和不顾事实地一口咬定，所以没有同德国最后媾和，责任在苏联身上。
    赫脱在分析苏联的和约草案时顽固地无视目前存在着两个德国、而重新统一德国的任务是德国人民自己的事情这样一个事实。赫脱硬说，从法学观点看来，和约只能同统一后的德国缔结。然而大家知道，美国自己和其他西方国家一直在制造重重障碍，阻挠德国在和平民主的基础上统一起来。
    赫脱最后说，美国已经研究了苏联提出的对德和约草案，他还说，研究草案时非常仔细，希望也许能够为永久性地同德国媾和开辟出一条道路。赫脱说，如果苏联的建议是这样的话，美国就会表示欢迎了。他说，可是相反，这个建议中包括着可能成为未来的争执和冲突的原因的因素。
    葛罗米柯发言
    苏联外交部长葛罗米柯接着发言。
    葛罗米柯说，在美、英、法三国政府提交我们的会议研究的建议中，许多问题一个跟一个互相纠缠在一起，三国计划不是把东西方之间的矛盾逐个解决，而是把这些矛盾缠成一个紊乱的大结。在西方建议中，单单是使对德和约和柏林问题从属于德国统一这一点，就使这个计划成了空想的、仅仅迎合德意志联邦共和国的那些极端分子的心意的计划，这些极端分子今后也要抵制就已经成熟了的问题达成协议的可能性，不让国际紧张局势趋于缓和。
  苏联外长指出，西方国家事先明明知道苏联对在这次会议上研究恢复统一德国问题的态度。但是，西方三国的分阶段计划却偏偏又重新把统一德国问题提到了中心地位。
    葛罗米柯指出，在当前情况下，统一的德国只有通过已经走了几乎十年的独立发展道路的两个德国达成协议才能出现。苏联政府认为，另外的道路是没有的，也是不可能有的。
    葛罗米柯在谈到计划中所说的四大国应当建立全德混合委员会那一点时着重指出，当然，苏联并不反对建立全德混合委员会的主张。但是，这个问题应当由德意志民主共和国和德意志联邦共和国政府来解决，它们自己能够确定全德机构的任务和成员。
    在谈到会议上关于四大国对解决德国问题和重新统一德国所负的责任的言论时，葛罗米柯说，四大国对解决德国问题负有一定的责任。四大国的职责就是保证准备和缔结对德和约。在目前情况下，这又是四大国对统一德国的事业的最有效的贡献，此外，四大国可以促进两个德国的接近，并促使两个德国就重新统一德国的途径达成协议。苏联代表团主张，四大国相应的保证可以作为补充条款或条款，列入和约或和约议定书之中。
    苏联代表团团长接着说，研究了西方国家所提出的计划之后就会明白，计划的全部内容，计划中所提出的所有措施的实现，事实上都要服从于一个先决条件——同意在四大国监督之下进行全德选举，这样就使这个计划成为不现实的和没有根据的了。我们不反对选举，但是，这个问题应该由德国人自己来解决，任何人都没有权利干涉他们的这种内政。
    葛罗米柯接着着重指出，苏联政府认为，西方三国的计划无论如何不能作为研究会议日程上的那些问题的基础。但是这并不是说，西方国家的计划中毫无可以单独拿来进行研究的部分，譬如说，有些部分可以按照适当程序在将来讨论欧洲安全问题或裁军问题的时候联系起来研究。
    葛罗米柯接着指出，苏联政府绝对不反对逐步地、分阶段地解决已成熟了的国际问题。但是我们认为这次会议的任务是分出这样一些问题，这些问题对国与国之间的关系影响最大，而且目前已经有可能取得接近的观点。如果要分什么阶段来解决国际问题的话，那么首先必须提出对德和约和柏林问题。
    在谈到西方对缔结对德和约的态度时，葛罗米柯说，西方三国在它们那个估计要几年才能完成的洋洋大观的计划中，把缔结对德和约挪到最后一个阶段，不仅如此，西方国家在计划中还搬出了在目前的国际局势中所能想得出来的一切障碍来堵塞通向缔结对德和约的道路。
    葛罗米柯提醒注意这样一个事实：三国的文件中根本就回避谈到对德和约的内容问题。他说，不管如何反复阅读这个文件，也找不出一个字是谈到这一点的。
    苏联代表团团长接着指出，三国计划中的具体建议，实质上是为了保持欧洲目前这种孕育着危险后果的紧张局面。他说，从三国的建议可以看出，它们希望，即使在和约签字后，德国境内仍然保留有外国军队和外国军事基地，而且期限还不是暂时的、有限制的，据说是要认真和永久地保留这些军队和基地。可见，摆在我们面前的是一个外国永久占领德国的计划。
    葛罗米柯驳斥了那种认为苏联的和约草案是为了
  “把西德从北大西洋公约组织中拉出来”的说法。他说，虽然我们认为，两个德国分别退出北大西洋公约组织和华沙条约是有好处的，但是我们不反对在对德和约签字后的某段时期内德意志联邦共和国和德意志民主共和国仍然分别留在北大西洋公约组织和华沙条约内。
    葛罗米柯接着谈到了西柏林问题。他说，西方三国关于柏林问题的建议，从头到尾都是不能接受的。三国关于柏林问题建议的实质，不仅是为了使西柏林的占领制度固定下来，而且还要把它扩大到整个柏林。西方国家不折不扣地想并吞德意志民主共和国的首都，并使整个城市置于外国控制之下。它们的方案无非是企图粗暴地破坏德意志民主共和国的基本主权，当然，这是不能容许的。
    苏联代表团团长接着分析了美英法三国计划中关于欧洲安全的那部分。他指出，计划起草人把这个计划中提出的其他问题，首先是德国统一问题的解决作为在欧洲安全方面实现任何步骤的前提。仅此一端就已表明，计划的目的是为了使欧洲有效安全的建立，或是使这方面的某些局部措施的实现都无法前进一步。苏联代表团团长说，三国计划起草人的主要和唯一的目的是，保障自己能在德国领土上也像在欧洲其他国家领土上一样驻扎军队。
    葛罗米柯说，三国计划规定有关欧洲安全的任何措施只有在全德政府成立以后，也就是只有在德国统一以后才能实现。这说明，计划中提出的有关欧洲安全的整个问题只不过为了装饰门面。
    葛罗米柯说，西方国家若是不把欧洲安全问题同自己的其他建议纠缠在一起，并且同苏联以及其他有关国家共同努力来建立欧洲安全的有效制度，那它们就是做了一件好事。葛罗米柯说，至于苏联，它将十分愿意通过适当方式单独讨论旨在巩固欧洲安全的任何明智的建议，其中包括西方三国计划中提出的某些建议。
    葛罗米柯在谈到西方国家计划中提出的裁军问题时说，西方国家使裁军问题也成为这个计划的不可分割的组成部分，并且使这个问题的解决取决于其他问题，首先是德国统一问题的解决。仅此一端，就足以说明，西方国家看来并不想打破这些问题的僵局。
    葛罗米柯追述说，长期以来，无论是整个裁军问题，或是它的各个部分都在联合国讨论过，苏联政府曾再三就禁止原子武器、大量裁减各国常规军备和武装部队等问题提出建议。苏联政府曾提出同时解决裁减各国武装部队和军备、禁止使用核武器和销毁储存的核武器的建议，禁止原子武器或放弃使用这种武器的单独建议以及裁减常规军备的建议。但是，西方国家没有接受其中
  任何一个建议，这样一来，西方国家就把自己锁在牛角尖里。西方国家目前的计划使得从这个牛角尖中走出来更加困难了，必须坦率地说，简直是不可能的。
    葛罗米柯继续说，在仔细地研究了三国计划以后表明，这一计划不符合外长会议的主要任务——筹备同德国媾和和谋求一致同意的解决办法来解决西柏林局势正常化这个迫切问题。西方计划只能使会议无法讨论真正有可能取得进展的一些问题。这一计划的基础实质上是西方国家过去提出过的建议，这种建议实际上无非是“冷战”计划，奉行“实力地位”政策的计划。
    苏联代表团对德意志民主共和国外长博尔茨就对德和约问题和柏林问题提出的建设性主张表示满意。他说，西方国家向我们提出的计划不可能作为讨论制订相互能够接受的解决办法的基础，但是，在三国计划某些部分中的个别条款和主张，如果进行单独研究而不包括在故意制造的整体中的话，那是值得讨论的。他说他这里指的是这样一些条款和主张，如四大国发表关于用和平方法解决一切国际争端、不给侵略者以援助的宣言，某些裁军问题、建立限制军备区。不过，他说，我们的会议应当把自己的注意力集中在关于对德和约和关于西柏林这两个刻不容缓的问题上。
