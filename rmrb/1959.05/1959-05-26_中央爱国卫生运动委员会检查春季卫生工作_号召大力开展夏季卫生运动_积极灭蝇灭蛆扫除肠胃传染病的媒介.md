Xinhua News Agency, May 25th - Since the beginning of this year, various regions have closely integrated patriotic health campaigns with production, achieving significant results. According to the information obtained at the recent spring hygiene campaign inspection and report meeting held by the Central Patriotic Health Campaign Committee: After the spring patriotic health campaign, the density of the four pests, especially rats and sparrows, in urban and rural areas across the country has significantly decreased compared to last year. Currently, it is not easy to find sparrows and rat holes in many villages. Tang County, Hebei Province, inspected 96 households in five natural villages and found only one suspected rat hole, and no sparrows. Sanitary manure accumulation has become a nationwide movement, clearing a large number of breeding grounds for mosquitoes and flies, further improving environmental sanitation. In Beijing, at the end of April, an inspection of over 92,000 households in four urban districts found that over 98% achieved "three cleans" (clean indoors, clean courtyards, clean streets in front of doors) and "four noes" (no flies, no mosquitoes, no rats, no maggots). Significant progress has also been made in the prevention and control of the four major parasitic diseases (schistosomiasis, hookworm disease, filariasis, malaria) that pose the most serious threat to people's health. During the patriotic health campaign, various regions also trained a large number of health workers, nursery workers, cooks, midwives, and animal breeders, strengthening the health management of construction sites, canteens, nurseries, and primary schools. In 42 cities and counties in Shaanxi Province alone, according to incomplete statistics, more than 293,000 cooks, nursery workers, midwives, and health workers were trained.

Representatives from various regions reported at the meeting that the patriotic health campaign this spring showed some new characteristics: First, the broad masses of medical and health personnel went deep into the production front lines, closely integrating the elimination of the four pests, hygiene, and the eradication of diseases with labor production, earnestly implementing the policy of health serving production, and overcoming the phenomenon that hygiene work could not be carried out when production was busy. In Pixian County, Sichuan Province, during the busy spring plowing season in April, more than 100 medical and health personnel were dispatched to collective welfare units such as commune canteens and kindergartens. By working alongside the staff, they treated illnesses and learned about the laws of production and life of commune members, driving the commune members to carry out the work of eliminating the four pests and promoting hygiene in conjunction with production labor, which rapidly improved the local health conditions and reduced the number of sick people, which was warmly welcomed by the masses; Second, most regions combined the manure accumulation movement with the fundamental work of eliminating pests and diseases, which both increased fertilizer accumulation to support production and eliminated the breeding of mosquitoes and flies, improving environmental sanitation. In Shanxian County, Shandong Province, each people's commune trained more than 20,000 manure managers, animal breeders, and cooks to manage manure, garbage, and sewage. Professional teams were established to divide responsibilities, ensuring that manure, garbage, and sewage were cleared daily and fermented with mud to become compost; Third, the health management of collective welfare undertakings was strengthened, especially paying attention to canteen hygiene. Many provinces and cities have issued special instructions to do a good job in canteen hygiene. The canteens of the people's communes in Nanyang Prefecture, Henan Province, put forward the slogan "Clean every day, clean everywhere, clean everything," and disinfected bowls and chopsticks. The canteen of Liang Kou Commune in Conghua County, Guangdong Province, created a native steam disinfection box, using bamboo tubes to introduce the hot steam from the boiling water pot into the cupboard to disinfect tableware. Due to the strengthening of collective hygiene work, the incidence of disease has been greatly reduced everywhere, making people feel more relaxed and energetic in production.

The person in charge of the Central Patriotic Health Campaign Committee pointed out at the meeting: Although the patriotic health work in various regions this spring has been further deepened and more meticulous than last year, some regions are still satisfied with general cleaning and sweeping work, and the fundamental work of controlling and eliminating mosquito and fly breeding conditions has not been done thoroughly enough, and the health work of collective welfare undertakings has not been grasped tightly. In carrying out the summer patriotic health campaign, various regions should pay attention to overcoming these phenomena. Currently, we should vigorously carry out the work of preventing summer gastrointestinal infectious diseases, actively eliminate flies and maggots, and eradicate the vectors of gastrointestinal infectious diseases. In this work, special attention should be paid to strengthening the health management of canteens and the catering industry, protecting the cleanliness of water sources; advocating that the masses do not drink raw water, and do a good job in preventing heatstroke, in order to protect the health of the working people and promote the development of production.

    中央爱国卫生运动委员会检查春季卫生工作
    号召大力开展夏季卫生运动
    积极灭蝇灭蛆扫除肠胃传染病的媒介
    新华社25日讯  今年以来，各地密切结合生产开展爱国卫生运动，取得了很大的成绩。据中央爱国卫生运动委员会最近在春季卫生运动检查汇报会议上了解的情况：经过春季爱国卫生运动，全国城乡四害密度特别是鼠雀密度比去年又有显著降低。目前许多村庄已经不容易发现麻雀和鼠洞了。河北省唐县检查五个自然村九十六户，仅发现一个可疑的鼠洞，没有发现麻雀。卫生积肥形成全民性的运动，结合积肥清除了大量蚊蝇孳生的条件，使环境卫生面貌有了进一步的改善。北京市4月底检查四个城区九万二千多户人家，做到“三洁”（室内洁、院内洁、门前街道洁）“四无”（无蝇、无蚊、无鼠、无蛆）的达到98％以上。各地对威胁人民健康最严重的四大寄生虫病（血吸虫病、钩虫病、丝虫病、疟疾）的防治工作，也进一步取得了显著成效。在爱国卫生运动中，各地还训练了大量的保健员、保育员、炊事员、接生员和饲养员等，加强了工地、食堂、托儿所及小学校的卫生管理工作。仅陕西省四十二个市县，据不完全统计，就训练了炊事员、保育员、接生员、保健员等二十九万三千多人。
    各地代表在会上汇报：今春爱国卫生运动出现了一些新特点：第一，广大医务卫生人员深入生产现场，围绕劳动生产把除四害、讲卫生、消灭疾病三者密切结合起来，认真贯彻了卫生为生产服务的方针，克服了生产忙了卫生工作就不能开展的现象。四川省郫县在4月间春耕繁忙时期，抽调了一百多名医务卫生人员到各公社食堂和幼儿园等集体福利事业单位，通过跟班劳动，一面治病，一面了解社员生产和生活各方面的规律，带动社员结合生产劳动开展除四害讲卫生的工作，使当地的卫生状况迅速改善，生病的人数迅速减少，受到群众热烈欢迎；第二，多数地区结合搞积肥运动，大力进行了除害灭病的治本工作，既增积了肥料支援生产，又杜绝了蚊蝇的孳生，改善了环境卫生。山东省单县各人民公社为了管好粪便、垃圾和污水，训练出二万多名粪便管理员、饲养员、炊事员，建立专业队伍分工负责，做到粪便、垃圾、污水等按日清理，并用泥封发酵变成沤肥；第三，加强了对集体福利事业的卫生管理工作，特别是注意了食堂卫生。许多省、市都为做好食堂卫生工作发了专门指示。河南省南阳专区各人民公社的食堂，提出了“天天干净、处处干净、样样干净”的口号，做到碗筷消毒。广东省从化县良口公社的食堂，创制了一种土蒸气消毒箱，把开水锅内的热蒸气用竹筒引入碗柜，消毒食具。由于集体卫生工作的加强，现在各地发病率大大降低，使人们更加心情舒畅，精神焕发地进行生产。
    中央爱国卫生运动委员会负责人在会上指出：今春以来各地爱国卫生工作虽然比去年进一步深入、细致了，但是，有一些地区还满足于一般的清洁、扫除工作，对控制和消灭蚊蝇孳生条件的治本工作做得不够彻底，对集体福利事业的卫生工作抓得不紧。各地在开展夏季爱国卫生运动中应该注意克服这些现象，当前应大力开展预防夏季肠胃传染病的工作，积极灭蝇灭蛆，消灭肠胃传染病的媒介。在这一工作中，应特别注意加强食堂和饮食行业的卫生管理工作，保护水源清洁；在群众中提倡不喝生水，做好防止中暑工作，以保护劳动人民的健康，促进生产的发展。
