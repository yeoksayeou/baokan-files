Xinhua News Agency, May 10th dispatch from Buenos Aires: The second meeting of the "Committee of Twenty-One" of the United States and Latin American countries, held in the Argentine capital, ended on the 8th in an atmosphere filled with contradictions. The United States' attempt to drag Latin American countries into a military bloc under the guise of "economic cooperation" has suffered another setback.

This meeting, which the "New York Times" described as "boxing practice" and a "battle of words," was a continuation of the first Twenty-One Nation Conference held in Washington last November. Originally, many Latin American authorities hoped to alleviate their current economic difficulties through some form of "economic cooperation," especially loans from the United States. However, various draft resolutions submitted to the meeting by a "Fifteen-Nation Working Group" with US participation contained many clauses that only favored US economic plunder. Many delegates vehemently criticized these draft resolutions. For example, the provision regarding capital-importing countries "reconsidering (their) policies, legislation, and administrative methods to improve investment conditions" was opposed by the delegations of Mexico, Uruguay, and Cuba. The Uruguayan delegation pointed out that this provision meant infringing upon the sovereignty of various countries. Delegates also criticized the United States' trade discrimination and economic plunder policies.

According to reports, at the meeting on the 8th, US representative Thomas Mann suggested signing the final declaration of the meeting without reading it in the plenary session of the committee. However, many delegations opposed his suggestion. They opposed such wording in the declaration as: the meeting elevated "economic issues and common security issues to the same level, which indicates a major achievement." At the closing ceremony, the delegations of Chile, Mexico, Cuba, and Uruguay refused to sign the declaration. The delegates only agreed to issue a press release instead of a declaration.

According to the meeting communiqué, the resolutions passed by the meeting included holding a meeting of foreign ministers of the Americas to "study" the serious economic crisis issues of certain countries, and requiring countries to ratify the agreement on the establishment of the Inter-American Development Bank before the end of this year. However, the meeting did not achieve concrete results regarding the problems urgently demanded by Latin American countries due to the United States' plunder policies, such as fluctuations in raw material prices and trade discrimination.

    美洲二十一国会议草草结束
    美经济掠夺政策遭到抨击
    据新华社10日讯　布宜诺斯艾利斯消息：美国和拉丁美洲各国在阿根廷首都举行的“二十一国委员会”第二次会议，已经在8日在充满着矛盾的气氛中结束。美国企图在“经济合作”的幌子下把拉丁美洲国家拉入军事集团的努力已遭到又一次失败。
    这次被“纽约时报”形容成“拳击练习”和“舌战”的会议是去年11月在华盛顿召开的第一次二十一国会议的继续。本来，许多拉丁美洲国家当局希望通过某种“经济合作”，特别是美国的贷款，来解救目前的经济困难。但是，一个有美国参加的“十五国工作小组”向会议提出的各项决议草案中，却包含着许多只有利于美国进行经济掠夺的条款。许多代表对这些决议草案进行了激烈的抨击。例如关于要资本输入国家“重新考虑（他们的）政策、立法和行政方法以改善投资的条件”的条文就遭到墨西哥、乌拉圭和古巴代表团的反对。乌拉圭代表团指出，这个规定意味着侵犯各国的主权。各国代表还抨击了美国的贸易歧视和经济掠夺政策。
    据报道，在8日的会议上，美国代表托马斯·曼曾建议不在委员会全体会议上宣读，就签署会议的最后宣言。但是许多代表团都反对他这个建议。他们反对宣言中这样的提法，比如：会议把“经济问题和共同安全问题提到同一水平，这表明是一个重大的成就。”在闭幕式上，智利、墨西哥、古巴和乌拉圭各国代表团拒绝在宣言上签字。代表们只同意发表一项新闻公报，而不发表宣言。
    根据会议公报，会议通过的决议包括举行美洲各国外长会议“研究”某些国家严重的经济危机问题，要求各国在今年年底前批准关于成立泛美银行的协议等项。但是会议对于拉丁美洲各国迫切要求解决的由于美国的掠夺政策造成的原料价格波动和贸易歧视等问题，却没有取得具体的结果。
