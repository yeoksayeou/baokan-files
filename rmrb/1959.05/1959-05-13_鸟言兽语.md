In the sunny zoo, the guide is introducing mynas and parrots to the audience. He makes the myna sing "Duō shao mǐ duō" [How much rice?], and the parrot say "Hello," "Goodbye," or deliberately provokes them to anger, making them curse "What thing?" etc., which makes the audience feel very surprised and interesting.

Then, the guide took the audience to see the red-faced monkeys. He said that the red-faced monkey is an animal that "likes praise and hates criticism." He said to the red-faced monkey: "How beautiful you are!" At this time, the red-faced monkey showed a smug look. "You are so ugly, what a sight!" The red-faced monkey became furious, shaking the cage so hard that it rattled, causing the audience to burst into laughter.

On the dusty road, a coachman was driving a carriage.
"Giddy up, giddy up!" The horse pulled the cart and ran even harder. "Whoa—!" The horse seemed to hear a "Attention" command and stopped suddenly.

In our legends, there are stories of Gongye Chang and Jie Ge Lu understanding the language of birds and beasts. As for fairy tales and myths, the language of birds and beasts is even more common.

Do birds and beasts have languages after all, or at least, can they understand human language?

Language is unique to humans because it is produced by human collective labor. As for the things that animals need to convey to each other, such as finding a partner, looking for food, warning that enemies are coming, etc., are few in number. And these things can be conveyed without precise and clear language.

Although the vocal organs of mynas and parrots allow them to make some sounds similar to human language, this is only a conditioned reflex. They cannot truly understand human meaning, so their words are few and simple, and they often make mistakes. For example, they may say "Goodbye" when they see you, but ask "Hello" when you part.

The red-faced monkeys, as well as mules, horses, and other animals that are closely related to humans, only receive simple signals based on the different tones of human voices, which cause different actions. The tone of "How beautiful you are!" and "You are so ugly, what a sight!" is obviously completely different.

Then, can it be said that there are simple sound signals between birds or beasts that live together? This is possible. Of course, this is "language" that should be in quotation marks, and it is essentially different from human language.

Recently, I saw an article in a Soviet magazine that talked about the types of bird "languages" being as numerous as those of humans. According to linguists' statistics, the total number of languages in the world reaches 2,796, not including different dialects of the same language.

At the Second World Congress of Acoustics, someone reported that French crows were much better at "foreign languages" than American crows. When French crows heard the "assembly" call of American crows, they acted in concert with the American crows; but when American crows heard the French crows calling out in pain, they indifferently preened their feathers. And French seagulls only shrugged their wings when they heard American gulls searching for food or crying out in panic.

This led ornithologists to conclude that birds living in different regions of the earth, even of the same species, do not have a "common language."

In addition, some books also talk about the "language" of fish and even insects. In fact, the "language" of all other animals is just some simple sound signals, just like the bird and beast language mentioned above. It and the language of human social exchange of ideas are by no means "one into two, and two into one."

    鸟言兽语
    祥夫
    在春光明媚的动物园里，讲解员在给观众介绍八哥和鹦鹉。他让八哥唱“多数米多”，让鹦鹉说“您好”、“再见”，或者故意惹它们发怒，让它们骂“甚么东西”等等，使得观众感到非常惊奇有趣。
    接着，讲解员又带观众去看红面猴。他说红面猴是一种“喜欢表扬，讨厌批评”的动物。他对红面猴说：“您是多么漂亮啊！”这时候红面猴便显出一副飘飘然的神气来。“你真丑，甚么样子！”红面猴大发脾气，把笼子摇得嘎拉嘎拉地响，引得观众大笑起来。
    在尘土飞扬的大路上，马车夫驾着马车在奔走。
   “驾、驾！”马儿拉着车子奔跑得更起劲了。“吁——！”马儿仿佛听到了一声“立正”的口令，突然地停了下来。
    在我国传说中有公冶长、介葛卢懂鸟言兽语的故事。至于童话和神话中，鸟言兽语更是普遍。
    究竟鸟兽有没有语言，或者至少，它们会不会听懂人的语言呢？
    语言是人类特有的，是因为人类的集体劳动而产生出来的。至于动物之间，它们所要传达的东西，如找对象、寻食物、警告敌人来了等等，是屈指可数的。而这些东西，不用精密、清晰的语言也可以传达出来。
    八哥和鹦鹉，虽然它们的发声器官允许它们发出一些和人类语言差不多的声音，但是这只是一种条件反射，它们并不能真正了解人的意思，因此它们的话很少，很简单，而且经常要出错，例如它可能一见您的面就说“再见”，而当分别的时候，却问起“您好”来。
    那红面猴，以及和人类关系最密切的骡、马等，也只是根据人的不同声调，得到简单的信号，因而引起不同的行动而已。“您是多么漂亮啊！”和“你真丑，甚么样子！”语气显然是完全不一样的。
    那么，共同生活的一种鸟或兽之间，是不是可以说，有简单的声音信号呢？这倒是可以的。当然，这是应该加上引号的“语言”，它和人类的语言有本质的区别。
    最近看到苏联杂志上有这么一篇文章，谈到鸟类“语言”的种类和人类的一样繁多。而根据语言学家统计，世界各民族语言总数达两千七百九十六种之多，还不包括同一种语言的不同方言在内。
    第二届世界声学家代表大会上，有人报告：法国乌鸦比美国乌鸦的“外文”程度好得多。当法国乌鸦听到美国乌鸦的“集合”叫声，就跟美国乌鸦一致行动；可是当美国乌鸦听到法国乌鸦痛苦地叫唤的时候，却漠不关心地啄理着自己的羽毛。而法国水鸥听到美国田鸥寻找食物或者惊惶的呼声，也只耸耸翅膀而已。
    这就使鸟类学家断定，住在地球上不同地区的鸟，即使是同一种类，也是没有“共同语言”的。
    此外，也有些书谈到鱼类、甚至昆虫的“语言”，其实，所有其他动物的“语言”，都同上面所说的鸟言兽语一样，只是一些简单的声音信号而已。它和人类社会交流思想的语言，决不是“一而二、二而一”的东西。
