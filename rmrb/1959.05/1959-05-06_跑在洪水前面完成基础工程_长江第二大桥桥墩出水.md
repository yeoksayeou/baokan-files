Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, May 3rd. The nine bridge piers in the water of the Chongqing Baishatuo Yangtze River Bridge, the second railway bridge across the Yangtze River currently under construction, have all been built above the water surface before Labor Day. Thus far, the bridge workers have completed the most difficult underwater bridge pier foundation work ahead of the flood season. Before the completion of the underwater pier foundations, the six bridge piers, two bridge abutments, and two pier platforms spanning the Chengdu-Chongqing Railway on the shore were also completed in March. Currently, the bridge workers are stepping up the pouring of concrete for the pier bodies above the water surface; the pre-assembly work for the steel beams is also underway simultaneously, and the beam erection project will soon be officially carried out.

The underwater pier foundation project of this bridge commenced on September 10th last year, and it only took more than seven months to complete all the construction above the water surface, which is about one month ahead of the original Great Leap Forward plan.

In order to ensure that all pier foundations would be completed in one dry season, the workers put forward the battle cry of "Get ahead of the flood!" They worked continuously day and night, regardless of wind or rain. Leading cadres took turns on duty, frequently going deep into the site to solve key problems. When machinery was insufficient, the workers used simple equipment to manufacture it themselves. They used methods such as earthen derricks and earthen cofferdams to solve the difficulties of insufficient machinery and materials, ensuring rapid construction. The workers also overcame the difficulties of the complex geological conditions of the riverbed with heroic spirit, using lengthened steel pile shoes and drilling large holes with small drill bits to allow the pipe columns to pass smoothly through the unprecedented isolated rock barrier. The rigging crew led by Communist Party member Jiao Qiyi first successfully tested the method of using two high-pressure water pumps to drive a hydraulic suction cylinder to suck out the large pebbles that hindered the sinking of the pipe columns, increasing work efficiency by more than 20 times. The fitters and drivers of the electromechanical department ensured a normal operating rate of machinery above 95% during the decisive stage of building underwater piers in March, greatly accelerating the progress of the project. Many situations show that the technical operating level of the bridge construction workers has greatly improved compared to the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge period.

### 跑在洪水前面完成基础工程  长江第二大桥桥墩出水

　　跑在洪水前面完成基础工程
    长江第二大桥桥墩出水
    新华社重庆3日电　正在修建的横跨长江的第二座铁桥——重庆白沙沱长江大桥，水中的九个桥墩已在“五一”节前夕全部筑出水面。至此，桥梁工人已经赶在洪水前面全部完成了最困难的水下桥墩基础工程。在水中桥墩基础完成之前，岸上的六座桥墩、两座桥台和跨越成渝铁路的两座墩台，也在3月份全部修成。目前桥梁工人正在加紧灌注修出水面的桥墩墩身混凝土；钢梁架设的预拼工作也在同时进行，不久即可正式进行架梁工程。
    这座大桥的水中桥墩基础工程，是在去年9月10日动工的，到全部修出水面只用了七个多月时间，比原订的跃进计划提前约一个月。
    为了保证在一个枯水季节就把全部桥墩基础修好，职工们曾提出了“赶在洪水前面”的战斗口号。他们不分白天黑夜，不管风雨，连续紧张施工。领导干部轮流值班，经常深入现场，解决关键问题。机具不足，职工们就利用简陋的设备自己制造。他们利用土扒杆、土围堰等方法，解决机具、材料不足的困难，保证了快速施工。职工们并以英勇的气概，战胜了江底河床地质情况复杂的困难，用加长钢桩靴和用小钻头钻大孔的方法，使管柱顺利地通过了从未遇到过的孤石难关。共产党员焦其义所领导的装吊工班，首先试验成功用两台高压水泵带动水力吸石筒的办法，把阻碍管柱下沉的大卵石吸了出来，使工效提高二十多倍。机电部门的钳工、司机等，在3月份修筑水中桥墩的决战阶段，保证了机具正常运转率在95％以上，大大加速了工程的进度。许多情况表明，修桥职工的技术操作水平比在武汉长江大桥时期有了很大提高。
