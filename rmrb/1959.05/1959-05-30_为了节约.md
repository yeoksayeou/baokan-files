To combat the difficulties of insufficient supply of certain raw materials, the broad masses of workers have traveled all over the country to seek resources; they cherish every inch of iron and every sliver of wood, repeatedly utilizing and nesting materials for cutting; they rack their brains to make more products with less raw materials. This not only overcomes difficulties but also unearths new potential in materials, fully leveraging their utility. The following are just a few stories we learned about in Shanghai.

		An Interesting Journey

	In the yard of the Shanghai May 1st Motor Factory, rhomboid pieces the size of palms are stacked horizontally and vertically. These are scrap silicon steel sheet pieces left over from the punching process at the Shanghai Motor Factory that makes larger motors. They are transported to this factory to be used in the manufacturing of small electric motors.

	Most of the motors manufactured by the May 1st Motor Factory are from four to ten kilowatts, and the round "motor laminations" (i.e., silicon steel sheets) inside need to be over twenty-five centimeters in diameter. How to make watermelon-sized motor laminations from palm-sized scraps? There are no difficulties before heroes. The workers of this factory use the "four-piece method" and "six-piece method" (four or six crescent-shaped pieces are pieced together to form a round motor lamination) to manufacture motor laminations that are of completely qualified quality.

	However, to swallow a large amount of scrap material, it is necessary to change the punching die. It used to take at least ten days to manufacture a set of punching dies. But in order to utilize scrap material as soon as possible, the workers of the punching die section, led by master worker Zhu Zhangdi, worked hard for twelve days and nights to make four sets of dies, using them to cut out motor laminations for four hundred and seventy-four motors in March.

	The silicon steel sheet scraps that fall from the punching teeth of the May 1st Motor Factory are even smaller, only the size of a triangular ruler used by elementary school students. But this is not yet waste material. The transformers in many beautiful radios sold on the street are made by the Wanli Motor Factory using these scraps. The Wanli factory originally used silicon steel sheets made of two "E" shapes pieced together into an "E?" shape to manufacture transformers. However, the scrap material transferred from the May 1st Motor Factory has sufficient length but insufficient width. After research by the workers, it was decided to change the "E" shape to an "F" shape, and then piece it together into an "F?" shape, so the transformers on radios and amplifiers were produced one after another.

	A complete silicon steel sheet one meter wide and two meters long, after being "eaten" layer by layer by the Shanghai, May 1st, and Wanli motor factories, only leaves pieces the size of a finger, which seems to be real waste. So the truck transports it to the waste warehouse. But who would have thought that these wastes are precisely the materials for manufacturing important parts for trucks? The workers in the warehouse patiently pick out the small pieces larger than a little finger, and the waste is "resurrected." The Xin Su Transportation Electrical Equipment Factory uses them to manufacture ignition coils for truck and tractor parts. The Xin Su factory is still the supplier of 80% of this product in the national market!

	This is one aspect of the Shanghai electrical machinery industry workers' struggle against raw material difficulties. The Motor Bureau has also set up a silicon steel sheet scrap allocation team to make the journey of silicon steel sheet scraps more rational and orderly, thoroughly achieving "making the most of everything, using it again and again"!

		Strange Customers

	In the battle against raw material difficulties, many workers are really racking their brains. Children's toys are originally meant to inspire children's intelligence, but sometimes they also open the door to adult wisdom.

	One day, two young people came to the toy counter of the Shanghai No. 1 Department Store, looking around as if they wanted to choose a toy. The enthusiastic salesperson estimated their interest and took out an electric car model to start introducing. However, the two "big kids" were not interested at all. The salesperson then took out a rag doll, saying: This toy is quite funny and the price is cheap, the head and limbs are made of wood shavings pressed together.

	"Ah! Made of wood shavings pressed together, buy one!" Before the words were finished, a young man took out a knife and stabbed the doll in the face. The salesperson was suddenly shocked! The young man quickly explained that they were workers from the Shanghai Machine Tool Factory, and the factory lacked a certain material. They heard that a kind of wood shavings could be pressed into dolls with high strength, so they wanted to buy one to try. The salesperson, hearing this, specially brought them to the office, where the people told them that there was also a product made of crushed cloth that had even higher strength, and took out a sample for the two special customers to take away.

	These two young people were Wang Fuxiong and Yu Linshi. When they returned to the factory, with the support of the Party committee, they conducted seven consecutive experiments and finally used crushed cloth to press into the "flange" parts of the machine tool. This part was originally made of steel, but after being replaced by crushed cloth pressed products, the cost was low, the manufacturing was simple, and the strength also met the requirements. To manufacture a "flange" with steel, it takes more than forty minutes to work on a lathe, milling machine, and other equipment; while using crushed cloth to press, it only takes one press and four minutes to press one. Other small parts of the machine tool can also be manufactured using this method.

		One Ton Equals One and a Half Tons

	There is such a factory in Shanghai: they use one ton of steel to make products that require one and four-tenths of a ton of raw materials. This factory is called Dazhongyuan Nut Factory.

	The nuts produced by the Dazhongyuan Nut Factory are supplied to factories that manufacture rolling mills, ships, switch cabinets, and bicycles. Screws generally weigh only a few ounces; the nuts used with screws are even smaller and lighter. For decades, factories that produce nuts, regardless of the size of the nuts, have used whole steel plates to punch them out.

	Young worker Ni Jianrong saw that the supply of steel plates was tight, and the round holes in the middle of the nuts, the punched-down "eye iron," were piled up like small mountains in the factory. In the past, the factory always treated it as waste. "It would be best if these 'eye irons' could also be used to make small nuts," Ni Jianrong suggested. The factory leaders immediately adopted this suggestion and transferred an experienced technician to assist Ni Jianrong in the experiment. After dozens of experiments, the small nuts made of "eye iron" were of the same quality as the finished products punched from whole steel plates.

	The Dazhongyuan Nut Factory uses this method to use the "waste" from processing larger nuts to produce smaller nuts, utilizing them layer by layer. In the first quarter of this year, this factory used ninety-eight tons of steel plates to make nuts that used to require one hundred and thirty-six and six-tenths of a ton of steel plates, over fulfilling the production plan.

		Footprints All Over the World

	Have people ever noticed that the rubber shoes you wear on your feet and the stationery you use to write letters to your relatives contain the hard work of many waste collectors? Waste collectors go all over the country to recycle waste and find raw materials, making great contributions to industrial production.

	Among these people, there is Wang Zuliang in Shanghai. In four months, he traveled to more than fifty cities and counties in five southeastern provinces and collected nearly forty freight cars of waste products. Among them, the one thousand-odd dan of waste rubber he collected from Fuzhou, Xiamen, Nanping, and other places can be used to make 170,000 pairs of galoshes after processing; it can also be used to make more than 5,500 tires, equipping 550 ten-wheeled trucks.

	To be a waste purchaser, one must be able to endure hardship. At the end of last year, Shanghai's papermaking raw materials were very tight. Once, Wang Zuliang was urging the transfer of cotton stalk pith from Xinzhou, Hubei, to the railway line. Waiting for the public bus schedule would delay him for at least one more day. Wang Zuliang thought that industrial production was as urgent as fire, and even one day was very valuable. So he climbed mountains and ridges, walking sixty miles, arriving at his destination one day earlier than the bus. Another time, he was urging the transportation of papermaking raw materials from Yangxin County, Hubei, to Xichikou. Due to rain, the long-distance bus was not running, so he resolutely walked in the rain. In order to get the raw materials to the Shanghai paper mill as soon as possible, he decided to take a shortcut through an almost dried-up lake. At that time, it was the coldest days of winter, and the cold lake water submerged his knees. But at the time, he thought: if one person suffers a little, how many people will have paper to use? He insisted on walking in the lake water for a full eight hours, finally arriving at his destination ahead of schedule and completing his task.

    为了节约
    广大职工为了向某些原料、材料供应不足的困难作斗争，他们历尽千山万水，到处索取资源；他们珍惜寸铁分木，反复套裁利用；他们绞尽脑汁，以更少的原料做出更多的产品。这不仅克服了困难，而且挖出了物资新的潜力，充分发挥了物资的作用。下面只是我们在上海了解到的几个故事。
              有趣的旅程
    在上海五一电机厂的院子里，巴掌大的菱形片子横三竖四地叠放着。这是上海电机厂冲床做大的电机，“吃”剩下来的矽钢片废角料，运到这个厂，是用来制造小电动机的。
    五一电机厂制造的电动机大部分是四瓩到十瓩的，里边的圆形“马达片”（即矽钢片）直径要二十五公分以上。怎样把巴掌大的废角料造成西瓜大的马达片呢？英雄面前无困难，这个厂的职工们用“四拼法”和“六拼法”（四块或者六块半月形的拼成一个圆形马达片）制造出质量完全合格的马达片子。
    但是，要大量地吞嚼废角料，必须改换冲床模子。要制造一副冲模过去至少得十天。但为了尽快利用废角料，以朱章弟老师傅为首的冲模工段工人苦战十二昼夜便做出了四副模子，用它们在3月份剪出了四百七十四台电动机用的马达片子。
    从五一电机厂冲床牙缝里掉下来的矽钢片角料，是更小了，只有小学生用的三角尺那么大。但是这还不是废料，街上卖的许多漂亮收音机里的变压器，就是万利电机厂用它来做的。万利厂原来制造变压器用矽钢片是由两块“E”形拼成“E?”形的。但从五一电机厂调来的废角料，长度有余，宽度嫌窄。经工人研究，决定把“E”形改为“F”形，再拼成为“F?”形，于是收音机、扩音机上的变压器便源源出厂了。
    一张一公尺宽二公尺长的完好的矽钢片，经过上海、五一、万利三个电机厂层层“吃”过之后，大的也只有指头般大小，看来真成废料了。于是卡车把它运往废品仓库。但是谁又会想到，这些废料，恰恰又是制造卡车重要零件的材料呢？仓库的工人们不厌其烦地把小手指以上大小的小片片拣出来，废品又“起死回生”。新苏交通电工器材厂用它们制造卡车、拖拉机零件的发火线圈。新苏厂还是全国市场这种产品80％的供应者呢！
    这是上海电机工业工人和原材料困难作斗争的一个方面。电机局还专门成立了矽钢片角料调配小组，使矽钢片角料的旅程更合理、更有秩序，彻底做到“物尽其用，一用再用”！
            奇怪的顾客
    大战原材料困难的战斗中，许多工人真是挖空心思在动脑筋。小孩玩的玩具本来是启发儿童智慧的，但有时也打开了成人的智慧之门。
    一天，上海市第一百货商店玩具柜跟前来了两个年轻人，东张西望的像是要选购一件玩具。热情的售货员估量一下，便拿出一辆电动汽车模型来开始介绍。那知两个“大孩子”一点也不感兴趣。售货员随即又拿出一个布娃娃，售货员说：这玩具挺逗人，价钱便宜，头和手脚是用木屑压制的。
    “啊！木屑压的，买一个！”话还未说完，一个小伙子掏出小刀，对准布娃娃的脸上一刀戳去。售货员猛然一惊！年轻人连忙解释说：他们是上海机床厂的工人，厂里缺乏一种材料，听说有一种木屑可以压制成强度很高的娃娃，便想买来试试。售货员听他这样说，又把他们特别带到了办公室，办公室里的人告诉他们还有一种用碎布压制成的制品强度更高，并且拿出样品让两个特别顾客带走了。
    这两个青年人是王富雄和俞林士。他们回到厂里，在党委的支持下，连续经过七次试验，终于用碎布压制成机床的“法兰”零件。这种零件本来是用钢材制造的，改用碎布压制品代替以后，造价低廉，制造简便，而且强度也符合要求。用钢材制造一只“法兰”，要用车床、铣床等设备干四十多分钟；而用碎布压制，只要用一部压床，四分钟就可压一只。机床的其他一些小零件也可以采用这个办法来制造。
          一吨抵一吨半
    上海有这样一家工厂：他们用一吨钢材做出了需要一点四吨原料做的产品。这家厂叫大中源螺帽厂。
    大中源螺帽厂生产的螺帽，供给制造轧钢机、船舶、开关柜和自行车的工厂使用。螺丝钉，一般也不过几两重；配合螺丝钉用的螺帽，就更小、更轻了。几十年来，生产螺帽的工厂，不管大大小小的螺帽，都是用整块钢板冲制成的。
    青工倪建荣看到钢板供应紧张，而螺帽中间的圆孔，冲下来的一颗颗“眼子铁”，在厂里却堆得像小山一样。往常，厂里总是把它当作废料处理。“最好能够把这些‘眼子铁’也用来做小的螺帽”，倪建荣提出了自己的意见。厂领导立刻采纳了这项建议，并且抽调了一名经验丰富的技工，协助倪建荣进行试验。经过几十次的试验，用“眼子铁”制成的小螺帽，质量和使用整块钢板冲制的成品一样。
    大中源螺帽厂就是这样，把比较大的螺帽加工后的“废料”用来生产更小的螺帽，层层利用。今年第一季度，这个厂用九十八吨钢板，做出了过去需要一百三十六点六吨钢板才能做出的螺帽，超额完成了生产计划。
          足迹遍天下
    人们可曾注意到，你脚上穿的胶鞋，你给亲人写信用的信纸还包含着许多废品收购员的千辛万苦吗？废品收购员们千山万水去回收废品，寻找原料，为工业生产立下了汗马功劳。
    在这些人当中，上海有一位王祖良。他四个月踏遍东南五省五十多个市县，收集到近四十节车皮的废品。其中单他从福州、厦门、南平等地收集到的一千余担废橡胶，经过处理后，就可以制出十七万双套鞋；也可以制出五千五百多只轮胎，装备五百五十辆的十轮大卡车。
    做一个废品采购员，得能吃苦。去年年底，上海造纸原料很紧张。一次，王祖良从湖北新洲催调棉秆蕊去铁路沿线，等公共汽车班期，至少要多耽搁一天。王祖良心想工业生产急如星火，那怕一天时间也十分宝贵。于是他爬山越岭，步行了六十里路，比班车早一天赶到目的地。又一次他从湖北阳新县到喜池口催运造纸原料。由于天雨，长途汽车不通，他便毅然冒雨步行。为了使原料早日运到上海的造纸厂，他决定抄近路从一个将近干涸了的湖泊中穿过。当时正值三九严寒天，寒冷的湖水浸没两膝。但当时他想：一个人受点苦，多少人有纸用？他坚持着在湖水里走了整整八个小时，终于提前赶到目的地完成了任务。
