Actively Carry Out Academic Discussions and Promote Scientific Research
Tong Dizhou, Director of the Biological Department of the Chinese Academy of Sciences

Since liberation, China's scientific undertaking, under the leadership of the Party and the support of the masses, as well as with the assistance of fraternal countries, has achieved unprecedented success, just like other construction endeavors. Especially after the anti-Rightist struggle and the nationwide rectification campaign, illuminated by the general line of "going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in building socialism," the great leap forward in science and technology is unparalleled in history. This powerfully demonstrates that scientific undertakings can only achieve such high-speed development under the leadership of the Party.

Through this great leap forward, significant changes have taken place in scientific research: First, scientific research work has been closely linked with the country's economic construction, further implementing the policy of linking theory with practice and serving socialist construction with science. Second, conservative ideas have been broken, the wisdom of the masses has been liberated, and the communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act has been fully utilized. Third, a mass scientific research and technological innovation movement has been launched nationwide, and the ranks of scientific workers have rapidly grown.

All these changes have thoroughly transformed the face of China's scientific research work. The past cold and desolate scene has now become a vigorous and dynamic one. A large number of research projects have been widely carried out in scientific institutions, schools, factories, hospitals, and rural areas, and a large number of research results continue to emerge. In industry, modern science and technology are used in combination with China's reality to establish new working methods and systems. In agriculture, the miracles of high yields of grain, cotton, etc., have shaken many outdated theories in biological and agricultural sciences. In medicine, further exploration of the treasure trove of traditional Chinese medicine heritage, active promotion and application, and active sorting and research have been carried out. Therefore, a thriving and prosperous scene has emerged in the scientific field.

However, with the development of the cause, new demands have also followed. After the level of work has been improved, people cannot be satisfied with merely obtaining experience and accumulating data. With the emergence of new things and new achievements, further scientific analysis and theoretical explanation are required. Therefore, various problems are constantly raised in scientific research work and require solutions. Taking agricultural high yield as an example, deep plowing and close planting are important factors in increasing agricultural production. But for a certain crop, under certain conditions, to what extent should deep plowing and close planting be most appropriate? What is the reason? What scientific basis in soil science and plant physiology can explain this phenomenon? And so on. Solving these problems will help agricultural production to be further improved quickly. This is just one example. In other industrial, agricultural, and medical practices, there are countless questions that need to be answered scientifically. If they are not resolved in time, various undertakings will remain at the current stage and will be difficult to develop further rapidly. Also, among the new things we have discovered, there are phenomena that are not quite in line with old theories or old doctrines, or even completely opposite. Therefore, old theories need to be appropriately revised or supplemented, and new theories need to be established in a timely manner. Sometimes, there are even conflicting interpretations of certain objective phenomena, which obviously need further analysis and unification.

The emergence of these problems is a good phenomenon in scientific development. The solution to these problems, of course, requires multiple approaches, but holding academic conferences and conducting academic discussions in a timely manner are one of the best solutions. Since liberation, academic discussion conferences have also been held in various fields, but in terms of quality and quantity, they are not satisfactory. The reason is that on the one hand, subjective efforts are insufficient, and the organizational and preparatory work for many conferences is not done well, and the purpose and requirements of the conferences are not clear enough. Therefore, most of the conferences held are cold and desolate. Since the Great Leap Forward, the situation has been different. Research work is generally carried out according to actual needs, serving various construction undertakings, and the practice of construction has enriched the content of science. The richer the content, the more problems need to be solved. Therefore, all parties are eagerly demanding to hold academic conferences and conduct academic discussions. This can be seen from the Spectroscopy Conference held by the Department of Physics, Mathematics and Chemistry of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the Stratigraphic Division Comparison Conference in the Qilian Mountains area jointly hosted by the Department of Earth Sciences and the Lanzhou Branch of the Academy of Sciences. The number of participants in the meeting exceeded the expected number by a large margin, and the tense and enthusiastic atmosphere in the meeting was also rare in previous general academic meetings.

The role of academic discussion conferences is multifaceted. They can not only exchange experiences and learn from each other, but also solve problems and promote scientific research. Taking the summary of agricultural production experience as an example, many research institutions and educational institutions have a lot of biological and agricultural science workers working in the countryside, combining with the peasant masses, and conducting large-scale surveys and experiments on the basis of their creative deeds. In the past year, a lot of information and results have been obtained. However, everyone has different angles of observation of phenomena, and there are also differences in the methods of conducting experiments. Therefore, there will be different views on the analysis of things. If we can hold academic conferences in a timely manner for a certain problem and conduct free discussions, and make a correct evaluation and summary of the information and opinions put forward by all parties, this will have a great effect on promoting the work of the next step. If there are contradictions in the data and opinions, and no unified conclusion can be drawn, the disclosure of the contradictions can further explore the ways to solve them and conduct new experiments and observations, so it still has a great promoting effect on research work. This is the case in agriculture, and the same is true for many other research works.

On the other hand, large-scale academic discussions are the most encouraging and stimulating. Especially for young workers, it is more educational. Because after listening to the different work and different opinions of all parties, it can often give people multi-faceted enlightenment, open up ideas, and expand the field of thought. It can not only gather ideas, but also build on the past and open up the future. Therefore, after academic conferences, it is often possible to guide research work to a new direction and develop new scientific avenues.

Academic discussion conferences can not only promote scientific research and improve scientific quality, but also play an active role in the popularization of science. The participants and institutions are directly or indirectly related to the issues discussed. After the research results reported in the conference or the explanation of the phenomena are accepted by the audience, they will be quickly popularized to all relevant parties. Moreover, the issues discussed have a deep impression, which is much more effective than general publicity. Therefore, the role of academic conferences is to improve on the one hand and popularize on the other, with a dual meaning.

The development of science is inseparable from the application of new technologies. The results of scientific research also often differ due to the adoption of different technologies. Therefore, the object of discussion at academic conferences is not only the problem itself, but also the methods of solving the problem. This is especially important for the current situation in our country. Because the application of new technologies is still a starting stage, if it can be introduced in time at the conference, it will definitely play a great role in promotion.

Since the purpose of academic conferences is to carry out academic discussions, the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend" must be implemented in the conference. The greatest obstacle to scientific development is ideological conservatism and monopoly, and carrying out free debate is the most effective way to break conservatism and monopoly. The atmosphere of free debate in academics has not been well established in China's scientific community. Few opinions are expressed in person, and there is more criticism behind the scenes. This is the general habit of old intellectuals. Therefore, the most important thing in the meeting is to speak freely and make the problem deeper and deeper. If complex problems cannot be solved for a while, do not rush to make a conclusion. Different opinions can continue to be discussed based on the results of future research. Truth becomes clearer as it is debated, and sometimes it needs a time of testing. However, academic disputes are different from political struggles and cannot be confused. The former is a struggle in the ideological field, and the method of solving it should focus on presenting facts and reasoning, and persuading from an academic point of view.

Although academic discussion is not a political struggle, erroneous academic views and incorrect ways of thinking must be corrected. Many different opinions are due to different ideological viewpoints and differences in analyzing examples. Therefore, the debate of viewpoints and methods is a key issue in academic discussions, and must not be easily let go. Since liberation, although the bourgeois intellectuals have improved their ideological awareness to varying degrees after multiple political movements and study movements, in general, they have not completely abandoned the bourgeois world outlook. Therefore, in academic thought, it must undergo profound criticism in order to gradually use Marxism-Leninism as its guiding ideology for studying academics. Therefore, academic discussion is of great significance to the ideological transformation of intellectuals.

The forms of academic discussion conferences are diverse and should be determined according to our purpose and requirements. Some universities and research institutions used to have regular academic reports and academic discussion meetings, once a week or twice a week, reporting on the research work of the unit, or relevant academic works or research results at home and abroad. This system is very helpful in training cadres and promoting scientific research, and it can be widely promoted. Subject-based or thematic academic discussion conferences should be national or international. With more participating institutions, a wider discussion, and richer content. The participants should preferably include multiple natures: old, young, different viewpoints, different schools of thought, and scientists from other disciplines can also participate. This makes it easy to start discussions and can make the discussions more in-depth and comprehensive, and the atmosphere of the conference is also easy to activate.

The content of the meeting should reflect the achievements of scientific research in a certain period and the experience gained from practice. Therefore, there can be comprehensive reports in the meeting, summarizing the research results of a certain problem in recent years and the current development trend. This kind of comprehensive report is common in international academic conferences and has a certain role in promoting scientific research. Research topic reports should be the main part of the meeting. Whether the meeting is well held depends on the quality and quantity of the thematic reports, and also symbolizes the current development of this discipline or this issue. Past experience tells us that academic conferences that do not have or lack research topic reports always have empty and non-in-depth discussions, and therefore the academic atmosphere is not strong. Of course, we cannot demand too much in our current stage, but if we can do a good job in preparing before the meeting, the meeting will definitely be fruitful. In the process of the conference, it is best to arrange some examples of the application of new technologies or the assembly and use of new instruments. This way, explaining the application of new technologies in conjunction with specific research work will definitely be of great interest to the participants, and it will also play a great role in the promotion of new technologies, which is much more effective than verbal appeals.

The above is my personal opinion on carrying out academic discussions, which is of course immature and incomplete. But in any case, for the sound development of science in our country, we should conscientiously implement the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend" on the principle of serving socialism. And holding academic discussion conferences is the best way to carry out "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend." Premier Zhou pointed out in the "Government Work Report" at the First Session of the Second National People's Congress: "We believe that after the free debate of different schools of thought and different opinions in science, and the free competition of different forms and different styles in art, it will not be long before our scientific and cultural undertakings will be able to enter a prosperous era and achieve great achievements." Let us follow the instructions of the Premier and actively carry out free debate in academics!

    积极开展学术讨论，推动科学研究
    中国科学院生物学部主任  童第周
    解放以来，我国的科学事业，在党的领导和群众的支持下，以及兄弟国家的协助下，同其他的建设事业一样，有了空前的成就。尤其在反右派斗争和全民整风运动以后，在“鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义”的总路线照耀下，科学技术的大跃进是史无前例的。这有力地说明，科学事业只有在党的领导下，才能获得这样高速度的发展。
    通过这次大跃进，科学研究事业产生了重大变化：一、科学研究工作和国家的经济建设密切地联系起来了，进一步贯彻了理论联系实际，科学为社会主义建设服务的方针。二、破除保守思想，解放群众智慧，充分发挥了敢想、敢说、敢做的共产主义风格。三、在全国范围内展开了群众性的科学研究和技术革新运动，科学工作的队伍迅速地壮大起来了。
    这一切变化，彻底改变了中国科学研究工作的面貌，过去冷冷清清的场面，现在变得轰轰烈烈了。大量的研究工作在科学机构、学校、工厂、医院、农村广泛地开展了，大批的研究成果继续不断地涌现出来了。工业方面运用现代科学技术，结合中国的实际，建立了新的工作方法和体系。农业方面粮食棉花等的丰产的奇迹，动摇了生物科学和农业科学上的许多陈腐理论。医学方面进一步发掘祖国医学遗产的宝库，积极推广应用，并积极加以整理和研究。所以在科学园地上，呈现出了一片蓬蓬勃勃、欣欣向荣的景象。
    但随着事业的发展，新的要求也接踵而来了。工作水平提高以后，人们不能仅仅满足于经验的获得和资料的积累。对新事物、新成果的出现，要求进一步作出科学的分析和理论的说明。因此在科学研究工作中，就不断地提出各种问题，要求解决。以农业丰产为例，深耕密植是农业增产中的重要因素。但对某种作物，在某种条件下，深耕密植究竟应当达到什么程度最为适宜？原因是什么？在土壤学上和植物生理学上有什么科学根据可以说明这种现象？等等。解决了这些问题，就会有助于农业生产很快得到进一步的提高。这仅仅是一个例子。其他在工业、农业、医学的实践上，要科学回答的问题不可胜数，如果不及时解决，就会使各种事业停留在现在阶段上，而难于迅速得到进一步的发展。还有，在我们新发现的事物中，有和旧理论或旧学说不十分符合、甚至有完全相反的现象，因此旧的理论需要适当地修正或补充，新的理论需要及时地建立。有时更有某些客观现象，存在着互相矛盾的解释，这显然需要作进一步的分析和统一。
    这些问题的出现，是科学发展中的好现象。问题的解决，当然要从多方面进行，但及时举行学术会议、开展学术讨论，是最好的解决方法之一。解放以后，各方面也曾经举行过学术讨论会议，但就质和量来讲，都是不能令人满意的。原因是一方面主观努力不够，许多会议的组织筹备工作做得不好，而会议的目的和要求也不够明确，因此所开的一些会议也就多半冷冷清清了。大跃进以来，情形不同了。研究工作一般都按实际需要，为各种建设事业服务，而建设的实践又丰富了科学的内容。内容愈丰富，要解决的问题也愈多。因而各方面对举行学术会议、进行学术讨论的要求也就殷切了。从中国科学院数理化学部召开的光谱学会议和地学部同科学院兰州分院共同主持的祁连山地区地层划分对比会议，就可以看出了这一点。参加会议的人数超过了预定的数目很多，而会议中的紧张热烈情绪，也是过去一般学术会议所少见的。
    学术讨论会议的作用是多方面的，既可以交流经验，互相学习，同时也能解决问题，推动科学研究。以总结农业生产经验来讲，各研究机构和教育机构，都有不少的生物科学和农业科学工作者下乡工作，结合农民群众，在他们创造事迹的基础上，进行大规模的调查和试验。一年来获得了不少的资料和成果。但各人对现象的观察，各有不同的角度，对试验的进行，也有方法上的差别，因此对事物的分析也会有不同的见解。如果对某一问题，我们能及时举行学术会议，展开自由讨论，对各方所提出的资料和见解，作一正确的评价和总结，这对下一步骤的工作的推进会有很大的作用。如果资料上和见解上有矛盾，不能得出统一的结论，更可以因矛盾的揭露，进一步探求解决的途径，进行新的实验和观察，所以对研究工作还是有很大的推进作用。农业方面如此，其他的许多研究工作也是一样。
    在另一方面，大规模的学术讨论会是最富有鼓励性和刺激性的。尤其是对年青工作者，更有教育意义。因为听取了各方不同的工作和不同的见解以后，往往能给人以多方面的启发，开导思路，扩大思想领域，既可以集思广益，又可以继往开来。所以在学术会议以后，常常能够使研究工作导向一个新的方向，开发科学上的新途径。
    学术讨论会议不仅能推动科学研究，提高科学质量，同时对科学的普及也能起积极作用，参加会议的人员和机构都同所讨论的问题有直接或间接的关系。会议中所报告的研究成果，或对现象的解释，被听众接受以后，就会很快普及到各有关方面。而且经过讨论的问题，都有深刻的印象，比之一般的宣传有效得多。所以学术会议的作用，一面是提高，一面是普及，有着双重的意义。
    科学的发展与新技术的运用是分不开的。科学研究的成果也往往因采用技术的不同而有区别。所以学术会议所讨论的对象，不仅是问题的本身，也包括解决问题的方法。这对于目前我国的情况来说尤为重要。因为新技术的应用现在还是一个开始阶段，如果能在会议中及时介绍，对推广一定能起很大作用。
    既然学术会议的目的是要开展学术讨论，因此在会议中必须贯彻“百家争鸣”的方针。科学发展的最大障碍是思想上的保守和垄断，开展自由争论是击破保守和垄断最有效的办法。学术上自由争论的风气，在我国科学界中还没有很好地树立起来。当面意见少，背后批评多，这是旧知识分子一般的习惯。因此，在会议中最重要的是要做到畅所欲言，把问题搞得更透更深。复杂的问题一时不能解决的，不要匆忙作出结论，不同的意见可以根据将来研究的成果继续讨论。真理愈辩愈明，有时是需要一个考验的时间的。但学术争论与政治斗争有所不同，不能把二者混同起来。前者是意识形态领域中的斗争，解决的方法更要着重摆事实、讲道理，从学理上来说服。
    学术讨论虽然不是政治斗争，但学术上的错误观点和不正确的思想方法，是必须予以纠正的。很多不同的见解是由于思想观点的不同和分析事例的差异。所以观点和方法的争辩，是学术讨论中关键性问题，绝不能轻易放过。解放以来，资产阶级知识分子经过多次政治运动和学习运动，思想觉悟虽然有了不同程度的提高，但一般来说，还没有完全抛弃资产阶级的世界观。所以在学术思想上，必须经过深刻的批判，才能逐步地以马克思列宁主义作为自己钻研学术的指导思想。因此，学术讨论对知识分子的思想改造来说，是有极其重大意义的。
    学术讨论会议的形式是多种多样的，要看我们的目的和要求来决定。有些高等学校和研究机构，过去有定期的学术报告和学术讨论会，一星期一次，或二星期一次，报告本单位的研究工作，或国内外有关的学术专著或研究成果。这一制度对培养干部和推动科学研究很有作用，是可以普遍推行的。学科性的或专题性的学术讨论会议，应当是全国性或国际性的。参加的机构多了，讨论的面广了，内容也就更丰富了。参加会议的人最好能包括多种性质的：年老的，年青的，不同观点不同学派的，也可以有其他学科的科学家参加，这样就容易展开讨论，并能使讨论更深入、更全面，会议的空气也就容易活跃起来。
    会议的内容应当是反映着一定时期科学研究的成果和从实践中所得到的经验。因此会议中可以有综合性的报道，总结几年来对某一问题研究的成果，和目前进展的趋向。这种综合性的报道，在国际学术会议中很多，对科学研究的推动有着一定的作用。研究的专题报告，应当是会议中的主要部分。会议是否开得好，就要看专题报告的质量和数量，同时也象征着这一学科或这一问题目前发展的情况。过去的经验告诉我们，凡是没有或缺乏研究专题报告的学术会议，讨论总是空泛、不深入，因而学术空气也不浓厚。当然在我们现阶段的情况下不能要求过高，但如果能在会前做好准备工作，会议肯定是能得到收获的。在会议的过程中最好能布置一些新技术的应用或新仪器的装配和使用等的示例。这样结合具体研究工作来说明新技术的运用，对参加会议的人来讲，一定会感到极大的兴趣，而对新技术的推广，也会起很大的作用，比之口头的号召，效力要大得多。
    以上所讲的是我个人对于开展学术讨论的几点意见，当然是不成熟、不全面的。但无论如何，为了我国科学的健全发展，应当在为社会主义服务的原则上，认真贯彻执行“百家争鸣”的方针。而举行学术讨论会议，则是开展“百家争鸣”的最好办法。周总理在第二届全国人民代表大会第一次会议上的“政府工作报告”中指出：“我们相信，经过科学上不同学派、不同见解的自由争论，艺术上不同形式、不同风格的自由竞赛，不要很久，我们的科学文化事业一定能够进入一个昌盛的时代，并且获得伟大的成就。”让我们遵照总理的指示，在学术上积极开展自由争论吧！
