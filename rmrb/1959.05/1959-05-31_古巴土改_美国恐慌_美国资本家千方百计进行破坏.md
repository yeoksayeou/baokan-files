Xinhua News Agency, Havana, May 29th. American monopoly capitalists and domestic reactionary forces, who own large amounts of land in Cuba, are plotting to sabotage land reform.

    According to reports, American plantation owners, sugar giants, and big businessmen recently formulated a secret plan aimed at sabotaging land reform. According to this plan, they will stop operating all sugarcane plantations, causing 100,000 agricultural workers to lose their jobs, causing poor harvests in the sugarcane fields, and reducing sugar production. They will then blame the decline in production on land reform and the policies of the Cuban government. They believe that this will force the Cuban government to abandon land reform.

    After the Cuban government announced the land reform law, United Press International issued a message from Havana on May 20, quoting an American sugar factory manager threatening that due to Cuba's promulgation of the land reform law, no one "will invest in planting sugarcane anymore." After this, the United Fruit Company and other sugar factories stopped production.

    According to an Associated Press report on May 23, sugar factory owners, including United Fruit Company Vice President William Reines, had threatened Prime Minister Castro, saying that the land reform law would bring "serious economic consequences" to Cuba and demanded that he reconsider the law.

    古巴土改　美国恐慌
    美国资本家千方百计进行破坏
    新华社哈瓦那29日电　在古巴拥有大量土地的美国垄断资本家和国内的反动势力，正在阴谋破坏土地改革。
    据报道，美国大庄园主、糖业巨头和大商人最近拟定了一个旨在破坏土地改革的秘密计划。按照这个计划，他们将停止所有甘蔗园的经营，使十万农业工人失业，使甘蔗园歉收，并缩减蔗糖生产，然后把生产下降归咎于土改和古巴政府的政策。他们认为，这样就可以迫使古巴政府放弃土地改革。
    古巴政府公布土地改革法以后，合众国际社在5月20日从哈瓦那发出一条消息，这条消息引用一位美国制糖厂经理的话威胁说：由于古巴公布了土地改革法，任何人“都不会再投资种植甘蔗了。”在这以后，美国联合果品公司和其他一些制糖厂就停止了生产。
    另据美联社5月23日报道，包括美国联合果品公司副总经理威廉·雷恩斯在内的糖厂主们曾向卡斯特罗总理进行要挟，说什么土地改革法将给古巴带来“严重经济后果的东西”。并且要求他重新考虑这项法律。
