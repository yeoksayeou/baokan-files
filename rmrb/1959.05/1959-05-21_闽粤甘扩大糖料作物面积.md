Fujian, Guangdong, and Gansu Expand Sugar Crop Area
    The sugarcane planting work in Fujian Province has concluded. This year, the sugarcane planting area in the province has expanded from over 370,000 mu last year to over 418,000 mu. Currently, the sugarcane seedlings are growing vigorously, with early-planted seedlings reaching two to three feet in height.
    According to statistics from early May, Guangdong has planted over 2.04 million mu of sugarcane. Zhanjiang Prefecture, the province's largest sugarcane-producing area, has planted 690,000 mu of sugarcane. Many areas are still rushing to plant.
    Gansu Province has planted over 110,000 mu of sugar beets, an increase of 40,000 mu compared to last year. Some areas have more than 20 years of experience. To facilitate on-site processing of sugar beets, the province has newly built more than 150 small-scale indigenous sugar factories.

    闽粤甘扩大糖料作物面积
    福建省甘蔗种植工作已经结束。今年全省甘蔗种植面积由去年的三十七万多亩扩大到四十一万八千多亩。目前，蔗苗都长得很茂盛，早种的蔗苗高达二、三尺。
    据五月初的统计，广东已种甘蔗二百零四万多亩。全省最大的甘蔗产区——湛江专区，已种甘蔗六十九万亩。许多地区仍在继续抢种。
    甘肃省已栽种甜菜十一万多亩，比去年增种了四万亩。有些地方已经有二十多年的经验。为便于甜菜就地加工，全省已经新建小型土糖厂一百五十多个。
