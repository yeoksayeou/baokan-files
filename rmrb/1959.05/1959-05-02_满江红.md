Comrade Huang Xinyan's Speech

Fellow Committee Members:

We have returned from Hong Kong and Macau to participate in this historic conference of dividing the times. We are very excited to hear the reports from the leaders and the speeches from the representatives and committee members. We have already made a joint statement regarding our study and understanding of the documents, expressing our common opinions. Now, I would like to add a "Manjianghong" poem with my personal feelings about the entire conference as a supplementary speech. I would be grateful if the committee members could point out any inaccuracies.

Achievements are brilliant, historically, unprecedented.
The Great Leap Forward, last year's peak, continues to increase by thousands of feet.
The people of the whole country are inspired, and this year's enthusiasm is even more vigorous.
Waiting for the tenth anniversary celebration to come, to dedicate achievements.

Listening to reports, talking about principles.
Magnificent undertakings, brilliant strategies.
Love the nation and family like jade.
Internal conspiracies have been contained, and external nonsense should be stopped.
Strengthen our determination to safeguard world peace, our full duty.

    黄新彦委员的发言各位委员：
    我们由港澳回来参加这个划分时期的历史性会议，得聆各首长的报告和各代表与各委员的发言，至感兴奋。对于文件的学习和体会，我们已有联合发言，表示我们共同的意见了。兹更就个人对整个会议所发生的感想，填了一首“满江红”词，以作补充的发言。是否有当，请各委员指正为幸。
    成就辉煌，历史上，空前出色。大跃进，去年高峰，续增千尺。举国人民被鼓舞，今年干劲更昂激。待十周年庆祝来临，献功绩。
    听报告，谈原则。宏伟业，英明策。爱民族家庭如璧。内部阴谋已遏止，外边胡说应停息。更坚心保世界和平，全天职。
