Viewing Tibetan Rebels from a Legal Perspective
Speech by Committee Member Wang Zhixiang

Mr. Chairman, esteemed committee members:

I fully agree with the work report of Vice-Chairman Li Weihan of the CPPCC, the government work report of Premier Zhou Enlai, and the various reports of Vice-Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian. These reports summarize the work experience in various fields and point out the direction of future work. I wholeheartedly support them and am willing to do my utmost to participate in their implementation.

Having heard at the conference the many speeches by representatives and committee members regarding the Tibetan rebellion, which were stern and righteous, clearly distinguishing right from wrong, I fully agree with this justified outcry. Now I would like to offer my personal opinions on the Tibetan rebellion from a legal perspective.

The heinous crimes of a handful of Tibetan rebels and the provocative acts of imperialists and Indian expansionists in interfering in our country's internal affairs, after the truth has come to light and the conspiracy has been exposed to the world, have aroused severe condemnation from fair international public opinion. This shows that justice resides in the hearts of the people, and any rumors, slanders, or instigations by imperialists and reactionaries are in vain. Currently, all sectors of our country are filled with righteous indignation and are unanimously denouncing them. Tibetan monks and laypeople and the affected people are lodging accusations. This is the just voice of the people of the whole country. We will never allow the great family of the People's Republic of China, where people of all ethnic groups have united under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party through long and arduous struggles, to be divided. We will never allow any conspiracy of imperialists and all reactionaries to succeed.

From a legal point of view, it must first be pointed out that the nature of the Tibetan rebels is not that of political prisoners, but a gang of bandits composed of thugs. Their acts of carrying out riots, murder, arson, robbery, rape, trampling on monasteries, and destroying religious rules have determined that they are a band of bandits. What is particularly infuriating is that they dared to abduct the religious and political leader of the Tibetan people, the Dalai Lama, depriving him of his freedom in order to coerce and threaten, which is entirely the behavior of bandits demanding ransom in China's past. This is absolutely not allowed by the laws of any country and must be held accountable. From the various acts of violence carried out by this group of bandits, it can be seen that they have no political or religious flavor whatsoever. On the contrary, they have destroyed their existing political and religious status. Therefore, for these bandits, there is no question of any political asylum or religious asylum. The so-called political asylum, religious asylum, and right of asylum have certain connotations in international law and cannot be misinterpreted or abused. If asylum is granted to this gang of bandits with a bandit nature, allowing them to go unpunished, what kind of world would that be, what kind of international relations would that be?

Now this bandit gang has not only been granted asylum in India, but has also been welcomed, sympathized with, and supported by Indian expansionists and ambitious figures. They are using Indian territory as a base for conspiratorial activities, preparing to continue various criminal acts against our country, which is extremely rampant. As state officials of India, diplomatic officials have given these bandits various conveniences and distributed forged so-called "statements by the Dalai Lama" for them, which is even more incomprehensible. What is most infuriating is that members of the Indian Praja Socialist Party openly insulted the statue of Chairman Mao, the beloved leader of the Chinese people, in front of the Chinese Consulate in Mumbai. This is a great insult to the Chinese people and the People's Republic of China, which the Chinese people cannot tolerate. Not only that, but some leaders of Indian political parties are also clamoring to interfere in our country's internal affairs, promoting anti-China sentiment, saying that they cannot stand idly by while China suppresses the Tibetan rebellion, and some newspapers are advocating that India convene a meeting to discuss the so-called Tibetan issue. This behavior of imperialists and Indian interventionists is not allowed from the generally accepted principles of international law and the general practice of international relations. In particular, China and India have already concluded a treaty based on the Five Principles of mutual respect for territorial sovereignty, mutual non-aggression, mutual non-interference in internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence, and have established friendly relations, which is even more unacceptable.

In order to cherish the friendly relations between China and India, I suggest strongly protesting against this behavior of certain Indian ambitious figures that violates the treaty and undermines Sino-Indian friendship; and demand that the Indian authorities strictly abide by the Sino-Indian treaty, adhere to the Five Principles, ensure the safe return of the Dalai Lama, who was abducted to India, to Tibet, and return the fleeing bandits to the Chinese government.

### 从法律上看西藏叛乱分子  王之相委员的发言

    从法律上看西藏叛乱分子
    王之相委员的发言主席、各位委员：
    我完全同意政协李维汉副主席的工作报告，周恩来总理的政府工作报告和李富春、李先念副总理的各项报告。这些报告总结了各方面的工作经验，也指出了今后的工作方向，我衷心拥护并愿意竭尽棉薄之力参加贯彻执行。
    在大会上听到各位代表和各位委员关于西藏叛乱事件的许多发言，词严义正，是非分明，我完全同意这种理直气壮的呼声。现在我想从法律方面，提出个人对西藏叛乱事件的意见。
    西藏一小撮叛乱分子的滔天罪行，帝国主义者和印度扩张主义分子干涉我国内政的挑衅行为，在真象大白于天下、阴谋暴露于世界以后，已经引起国际间公正舆论的严厉谴责，可见公道自在人心，帝国主义者和反动派的任何造谣诬蔑、挑拨离间，都是枉费心机的。现在我国各界群情激愤，正在一致声讨，西藏僧俗人等和受害人民正在提出控诉，这是全国人民正义的呼声。我们决不容许在中国共产党领导下经过长期艰苦奋斗已经团结起来的各族人民康乐幸福的大家庭——中华人民共和国遭受分裂，决不容许帝国主义者和一切反动派的任何阴谋得逞。
    从法律上说，首先必须指出，西藏叛乱分子的性质不是什么政治犯，乃是一群暴徒所组成的匪帮。他们实行暴动、杀人放火、抢劫财物、奸淫妇女、践踏寺院、破坏教规等等行为，已经决定了他们是一帮土匪的性质。特别使人愤怒的，是他们竟敢劫持西藏人民的政教首长达赖喇嘛，使他失去自由，以便进行要挟，这完全是中国过去时代胡匪绑票勒赎的行为。这是任何国家的法律所绝对不能容许的和必须追究责任的。从这帮匪徒实行暴动的种种行为可以看出，他们是一丝一毫的政治气味和宗教气味也没有的，恰恰相反，他们是破坏了自己已有的政治地位和宗教地位。因此，对于这些土匪来说，是谈不到任何政治避难权和宗教避难权的。所谓政治避难、宗教避难和避难权，在国际法上说有一定的涵义，是不能加以曲解和滥用的。如果对于这种土匪性质的匪帮给予避难权，使他们逍遥法外，那还成什么世界，成什么国际关系呢？
  现在这个匪帮不仅在印度获得了避难权，而且受到了印度扩张主义分子和野心家的欢迎、同情和支持。他们利用印度的领土作为阴谋活动的根据地，对于我国继续进行各种犯罪行为的准备，真是猖狂到了极点。作为印度国家职员的外交官吏，还给这些匪徒以种种便利，替他们散发了伪造的所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”，更是使人不能理解的。最堪令人发指的，是印度人民社会党的成员竟在中国驻孟买的领事馆前公然对于中国人民敬爱的领袖毛主席像实行侮辱，这是对于中国人民和中华人民共和国的莫大侮辱行为，是中国人民所不能容忍的。不仅如此，印度一些政党的领袖还在大肆叫嚣干涉我国内政，宣传反华，说什么对于中国平定西藏叛乱不能旁观，一些报纸也在主张由印度召开会议讨论所谓西藏问题。帝国主义者和印度干涉者的这种行为，从国际法上公认的原则和国际关系一般的惯例来说，都是不能容许的。特别是中印两国之间已经根据互相尊重领土主权、互不侵犯、互不干涉内政、平等互利、和平共处的五项原则缔订条约，建立了友好关系，更是不能容许的。
    为了珍重中印两国的友好关系，我建议严重抗议印度某些野心家的这种违反条约、破坏中印友好的行为；并且要求印度当局严格遵守中印条约、坚持五项原则，使被劫持到印度的达赖喇嘛安全返回西藏，并将逃亡的匪帮交还中国政府。
