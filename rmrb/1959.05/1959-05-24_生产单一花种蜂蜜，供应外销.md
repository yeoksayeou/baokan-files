    Producing Single-Flower Honey for Export

    Due to the development of beekeeping in our country in recent years, it has opened up broad prospects for China's honey export business, which has a traditional market. Domestically produced longan honey, lychee honey, *jia* tree honey, and purple clover honey, known for their rich aroma, are highly praised in foreign markets.

    According to the materials available: exporting one ton of honey can be exchanged for more than three tons of steel or more than five tons of fertilizer; exporting sixteen tons of honey can be exchanged for a tractor. Our country's annual honey exports play a certain role in earning foreign exchange to support national construction. Farmers also benefit greatly from selling honey to the state; selling forty *jin* of honey is equivalent to the value of a bolt of white cloth; selling more than eighty-three *jin* of honey can buy a double-wheeled, double-furrow plow.

    Foreign markets reflect that foreign consumers generally prefer single-flower honey such as orange blossom honey, linden blossom honey, peach blossom honey, and pomegranate blossom honey, because single-flower honey is white in color and has a unique aroma, which can suit different consumer tastes. If our beekeepers produce this kind of single-flower honey, it will not only increase its value, but also make sales even broader.

    生产单一花种蜂蜜，供应外销
    由于近年来我国养蜂事业的发展，给我国有着传统市场的蜂蜜出口业务开辟了广阔的前途。以香味醇郁著称的国产龙眼蜜，荔枝蜜、椵树蜜、紫云英蜜，在国外市场上颇有好评。
    据掌握的材料：出口一吨蜂蜜可换回三吨多钢材或五吨多肥田粉，出口十六吨蜂蜜可换回一台拖拉机。我国每年出口蜂蜜对换取外汇支援祖国建设起了一定的作用。农民把蜂蜜卖给国家收益也不少，售出四十斤蜂蜜相当于白布一匹的价值；售出八十三斤多蜂蜜可以购进双轮双铧犁一架。
    国外市场反映，外国消费者一般喜爱桔子花蜜、菩提花蜜、桃树花蜜、石榴花蜜等单一花种蜂蜜，因为单一花种蜂蜜色泽白洁又具独特异香，能够适合消费者的不同口味。如果我国养蜂者生产这种单一花种蜂蜜，不但可以提高价值，而且能使销路更加广阔。
