Committee Member Xiong Qinglai Discusses Feelings After Returning from Europe, Urging Academic Colleagues Remaining Abroad to Return to the Motherland Soon

Chairman, esteemed members:

I fully agree with and wholeheartedly support Premier Zhou's government work report and the reports of the leaders. From these reports, I have a clear understanding of the splendid achievements of our country's socialist revolution and socialist construction in recent years, especially the tremendous results after the Great Leap Forward in 1958. I understand the magnificent and practical construction plan for 1959. I am extremely excited and fortunate.

Recently, a rebellion occurred in Tibet by reactionary groups. The government decisively and swiftly quelled it, which not only pleased the people, including the vast majority of Tibetans, but even the schadenfreude-filled imperialists, those foreigners with ulterior motives, and reactionary elements who failed to assess the situation, their own capabilities, and measure their strength, must have been astonished and humbled inwardly. From now on, the Tibetan people will be freed from the shackles of serfdom and will rapidly move towards happiness on the socialist path. The ideal of transforming the Tibetan plateau into a paradise will surely be realized. I also support the government's wise and swift measures.

I returned to China from Europe over a year ago. I can still recall the situation abroad, and I have a fairly deep understanding of the motherland after liberation. I cannot help but take this opportunity to say a few words and to inform academic colleagues remaining abroad, urging them to return to the motherland, which is becoming stronger and more prosperous with each passing day. I stayed in France and Switzerland for the last time to conduct some mathematical research. At the same time, I was also receiving treatment for cerebral hemorrhage. While there, I constantly heard that under the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, the motherland was advancing rapidly on the road to modernization. I felt the bright future of the country, understood the superiority of socialism, and realized the importance of standing on the side of the people and serving them. I resolutely returned home despite my illness. After returning to the country, witnessing the new face of the motherland, I felt even more excited and realized that the path opened up and led by the Party is indeed a smooth and shortcut to making the country strong. The new society that the Party seeks to build is indeed an ideal society where the people can attain happiness. After entering the country, I received meticulous care, which made me deeply feel the warmth of the motherland's embrace. Until now, I am working stably and happily.

In the past year, in my position as a researcher at the Institute of Mathematics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, I have deeply realized the grand organization and rapid progress of our country in scientific research, and the large contingent of working cadres. These facts were unimaginable to me when I was abroad. Through the Great Leap Forward, I especially saw the amazing efforts of all workers, especially the soaring enthusiasm of young workers. Last year, for the National Day, over three thousand scientific and technological achievements were presented, many of which reached international standards, and some even surpassed them. In cutting-edge academic departments, such as the manufacture of high-frequency transistors, the separation of rare earth elements, and the synthesis of water gas. Let me say a few words about my own field, mathematics. We all know that mathematics is a relatively basic science, and its progress is extremely important. Ten years ago, there were very few experts in our country, and the number of students majoring in mathematics at universities was also very small. For example, Southeast University, Tsinghua University, and Nankai University, where I served for many years, had no more than a dozen students in their mathematics departments. Now, many university mathematics departments have hundreds of students, and Peking University is said to have nearly a thousand. In the past, at most two or three dozen papers were read at the Chinese Mathematical Society. At the Mathematics Society held in 1956, it was found that about 150 papers were read. Furthermore, regarding China's mathematical journals, although there were several creative ones in the past, they were often not sustainable or difficult to publish on time. Now, journals of this nature, comprehensive ones (publishing mathematics and other scientific papers), include "Science Record" and "Science in China"; specialized ones include "Acta Mathematica Sinica" and "Advances in Mathematics," all of which have substantial content and are published on time. In addition, many university journals contain original mathematical papers. These figures and facts clearly illustrate the vigorous development of mathematics education and research in our country. In terms of the quality of research results, many have reached good international standards, and some have been praised by international experts, especially in number theory, several complex variables, function theory, and topology. In general, China's science, especially mathematics, has reached a fairly deep and far-reaching realm on the research front. However, for our large country with a population of over 600 million, we should have a larger workforce, more comprehensive development, and more brilliant achievements. I believe that actively cultivating cadres and widely seeking and recruiting specialists, especially those who lead research, is still an urgent task today.

There are still many experts from our country remaining abroad, and many have already gained international reputations. We should strive to get them to return to the country. As far as I know, they all eagerly hope that the academic status of the motherland will be on par with that of advanced countries, and they all want to contribute their expertise to the motherland. However, those who have not yet returned each have their own different problems, and a common reason may be that they have not estimated the great creative power of this social revolution. Therefore, it is difficult for them to imagine the rapid progress of all construction. Many still worry that the domestic conditions for their work are not yet available; or they have not deeply understood the significance of this revolution, and they are still bound by old ideas, making it difficult for them to make a decisive decision to return to the country. Speaking of this, I cannot help but recall my hesitation for a while before I left Europe. I will sincerely say them out. I originally did not want to be a person with backward thinking, but I had lived and worked in the old era (professor, university president). To work under a new system, some vague moral concepts given to me by the old books I read in the past caused instability in my mood, which can be said to be an ideological struggle. However, after analysis, I realized the truth. I recognized that the change in the motherland today is not the change of a dynasty in the past, nor is it merely the destruction of a corrupt regime. It is an unprecedented social revolution in our country, a great change that turns the world upside down, creates a new future for the motherland, and creates new life and happiness for the people. It is undoubtedly correct to move towards the bright future of the motherland, towards the happy path of the broad masses of the people, to serve the people, and to devote myself to the country's academic cause. So I made a resolute decision.

After more than a year of construction and the Great Leap Forward in various fields, the face of the motherland is very different from before. I dare to earnestly tell academic colleagues remaining abroad: the great socialist construction in the country is emitting a myriad of brilliance, and the broad masses of the people are showing even greater enthusiasm for such construction. Faced with this light and heat, all small personal problems should disappear. The so-called working conditions can be supplemented and created, and there is no worry that they will not be available. The ideal prospects of our country will surely be realized, and it will be faster than expected. We can say that an unparalleled glorious history is being written in the country, and a particularly brilliant page of academic history is being written. Academic colleagues can all become glorious successors to the pen. If we want to contribute our expertise to the motherland, this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. Colleagues remaining abroad, why not return soon? The motherland is reaching out its arms waiting for you!

Finally, I would like to say: After I returned to China, I discovered a broad new horizon in terms of scholarship and thought. I feel that I really need to study again and need to transform my thinking. These few days of meetings have given me a lot of inspiration. Although I am ill, I am determined to strive towards the goal of becoming both red and expert, and I hope that comrades will give me guidance.

    祖国的怀抱是如此温暖
    熊庆来委员谈由欧洲归国后的感想，并劝留在国外的学术界同人早日回到祖国来主席、诸位委员：
    我完全同意并衷心拥护周总理的政府工作报告及各位首长的报告。由这些报告，我确切地认识了我国几年来社会主义革命和社会主义建设的辉煌成就，尤其是一九五八年大跃进后的巨大成果，我认识了关于一九五九年宏伟而踏实的建设计划，我极感兴奋和庆幸。
    最近西藏发生反动集团的叛乱，政府以快刀斩乱麻的方式，及时削平，这不但是国人包括极大多数的藏人称快。想来就是幸灾乐祸的帝国主义，及别有用心的外国人和不审时、不度德、不量力的反动分子，内心里也不能不惊服。从此西藏人民将摆脱农奴制度的枷锁，必将在社会主义的大道上迅速地走向幸福，西藏高原变为乐园的理想必可实现，我也拥护政府的这个明智和神速的措施。
    我由欧洲回国，今有年余，国外的情形还能忆及，而对解放后的祖国已有相当深切的认识了。我不禁要借这个机会把我的感想说几句，并以告留在国外的学术界同人，劝他们早日回到一日千里地趋于强盛的祖国。我最后这次留在法国、瑞士，是进行一些数学上的研究工作；一方面因患脑溢血，也同时进行疗治。在那里，我不断听到祖国在党和毛主席的英明领导下，飞跃地在近代化的道路上前进，感到国家前途的光明，了解到社会主义的优越性，觉悟到站在人民方面，为人民服务意义的重大，毅然抱病归来。回国后，目睹祖国的新面貌，更觉兴奋，更体会到欲致国家于强盛，党所开辟出的并且领导着走的这条道路确实是坦途，也是捷径。党企求建设的新社会确实是使人民可以得到幸福的理想社会。我入了国门后备受照顾，使我深觉祖国怀抱的温暖，直到现在，我安定地、愉快地工作着。
    年余来，我在科学院数学研究所研究员的岗位上，深切地认识了我国在科学研究方面有若何宏大的组织，若何迅速的进步；工作干部已有若何壮大的队伍，这些事实是为我在国外时所未想像到的。通过大跃进，特别地看出全体工作者惊人的努力，尤其看出青年工作者冲天的干劲。去年十月献礼，科学技术的成果多至三千项，且很多是达到国际水平的，更有一些是有超越表现的。在尖端的学术部门中，如高频晶体管的制成、稀土元素的分离、水煤气的合成等。我再就我的本行数学方面特别地说几句。我们都知道数学是科学中较基本的一门，它的进步是极关重要的。在十年以前，我国专家甚少，在大学以数学为专业的学生亦是寥寥。例如我曾在里头服务过多年的东南大学、清华大学、南开大学等，其数学系学生至多不过十数人，现在呢，许多大学的数学系学生都以数百计，而北京大学者闻将达千人。中国数学会，往昔宣读论文，至多不过二三十篇。而在一九五六年举行的数学会，查宣读的论文约有一百五十篇之多。再就我国的数学的期刊说，有创造性者，往时虽有过数种，但往往不易持久，或难于按期出版，现在这样性质的期刊，综合者（登载数学及其他科学论文）有“科学记录”、“中国科学”等；专门者有“数学学报”、“数学进展”等，皆有相当内容，按期出版；又各大学学报载有创作性数学论文者，尚有多种。这些数字和事实，确切地说明了我国数学教育与研究的蓬勃发展。就研究结果的质量讲，达到好的国际水平者已不少，而为国际专家所称扬者亦已不乏，特别是在数论，多元复变数、函数论，拓朴学等方面。总的说，我国的科学，特别是数学，在研究阵线上，先锋所至，已达到相当深远的境域。不过，以我六亿余人口的大国，还应有更壮大的工作队伍，更全面的发展，更光芒的成就。我以为积极培养干部，广求罗致专才，特别是领导研究的人，仍是今日急务。
    我国现还留国外的专家不少，已享国际声誉者亦有多人，应争取他们回国。就我所知者说，他们莫不迫望祖国的学术地位跻于先进国家之例，莫不欲以其专长贡献于祖国，而未即归来者，各人自有其不同的问题，而普遍的原因，或者是未估计到这个社会革命的伟大创造力，因此对于一切建设的突飞猛进难于想像，不少人尚虑为国内未具备他们的工作条件；或者是对这次革命的意义，未深加了解，犹为旧思想所羁绊，不易断然作归国决定。话说至此，我不禁回忆到我离欧前一段时间的踌躇。我把它们诚恳地说出来。我本来是不愿做一个思想落后的人，可是我在旧时代生活过、工作过（教授，大学校长），要走到一个新制度下工作，往时所读旧书给我的一些笼统的道德观念，引起我心境上的不安定，可说是思想上的斗争。然而经过分析，我便觉悟到真理的所在，我认清祖国今日的这个变动，不是往时的一个朝代的更替，也不仅是一个腐化政权的摧毁，乃是我国空前的一个社会大革命，是一个旋转乾坤，为祖国创造新的前途，为人民创造新的生命与幸福的大变动。我走向祖国有光明前途的方面，走向广大人民有幸福出路方面，来服务于人民，来尽力于国家的学术事业，这动向无疑是正确的。于是我毅然作了决定。
    经过这一年多的建设和各方面的大跃进，祖国的面貌又与前大有不同了。我敢于恳切地告留在国外的学术界同人说：国内社会主义的伟大建设，实放出万丈的光辉，广大人民实为这样的建设表现出有加无已的热情，面对这光与热，一切小我的问题都应消失了，又所谓工作条件，可补充，可创造，而不患不具备。我国理想的远景必然实现，且会出乎意料之外的快。我们可以说，国内一部无比光辉的历史在写着，特别的一页灿烂的学术史在写着，学术界同人都可以成为一个光荣的接班执笔人，我们欲以所长贡献于祖国，此实千载一时的机会，留在国外的同人们，盍即归来，祖国在伸着双臂等待着你们啊！
    最后，我想说：我个人回国以后，在学问思想方面，发现了一个广阔的新的眼界，我感到我自己确实需要再学习，需要作思想的改造。这几天的会议尤给我不少启发。我虽然抱病，我立志努力向红专的目标迈进，希望同志们加以指教。
