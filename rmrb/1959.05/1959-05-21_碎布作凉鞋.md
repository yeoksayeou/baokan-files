    Sandals Made from Scraps
    The clothing factory of the Tianjin Department Store Retail Company sends leftover scraps of cloth from tailoring to shoe factories to produce various novel styles of women's sandals. This saves cloth and also keeps the selling price low. Shoemaking workers also cleverly use machines to firmly connect small pieces of leather into straps; leather sandals are made from these straps.

    碎布作凉鞋
    天津百货零售公司的服装厂，将裁剪剩下来的零碎布送给鞋厂生产各种新颖式样坤凉鞋。这样既节约布，售价也便宜。制鞋工人们还十分巧妙地把小块皮，用机器牢固地联成皮带，皮凉鞋就是这种皮带制成的。
