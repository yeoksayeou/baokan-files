Fujian Fisheries Experience a Bumper Spring Catch
    Frontline Fishermen Persist in Fishing Amidst the Struggle Against the Enemy
    (Our dispatch) Fuzhou - Currently, the spring fishing season in Fujian waters is booming. Frontline fishermen, persisting in the struggle against the enemy, bravely pursue schools of fish under the protection of the People's Liberation Army's coastal defense forces, with over 80,000 fishermen manning more than 12,000 fishing boats, working day and night at sea, striving for a bumper spring harvest. From January to April this year, the province caught a total of 2.2 million dan of various marine fish, an increase of 160,000 dan compared to the Great Leap Forward year of 1958. There has also been great development in freshwater aquaculture, with 1.8 billion fish fry hatched so far this year, an eleven-fold increase over last year.
    This year's spring fishing season in Fujian came early, generally half a month to a month earlier than last year. Thanks to the fishermen making early preparations for the spring fishing season amidst the intense struggle against the enemy, rushing to repair fishing boats and nets, they were able to start production half a month to a month earlier. The largest spring fishing ground in the province is in northeastern Fujian, where more than 20,000 fishermen are working hard in the waters around the islands of Sizhou and Taishan. The Sansha fishing port alone caught more than 22,000 dan of pomfret, eels, and other economic fish in one month; this year's cuttlefish catch is even rarer and abundant, with Fuding and Xiapu counties catching more than 80,000 dan in six days.
    During the spring fishing production, fishermen in various places launched a technical innovation movement, implemented diverse fishing operations, and extensively promoted new fishing gear such as "universal nets" and "universal hooks," thus greatly increasing the unit fishing yield.
    In the years since liberation, Fujian's aquatic production has been continuously developing. In 1958, the total output reached 9 million dan, an increase of 5.7 times compared to the year of liberation in 1949. The main reason for the great achievement in Fujian's aquatic production is that the Party and the government led the fishermen to realize the collectivization of fisheries production. Especially after the establishment of communes last year, it greatly facilitated the improvement of technology and increased production efficiency. In addition, the active assistance of the People's Liberation Army in crushing the enemy's looting and sabotage promoted the annual bumper harvests of fisheries. The state also provided great economic support to the fishermen, issuing large amounts of relief funds and fishery loans, helping fishermen solve production and livelihood difficulties, and greatly improving the fishermen's enthusiasm for production. In recent years, the People's Government has established storm warning stations, typhoon shelters, four meteorological stations, and a fishery broadcasting station in key fishing areas to promptly disseminate storm warnings. Many fishing boats have been equipped with radios, thus the lives and property of fishermen have been effectively protected, and the situation of "unexpected storms" has been greatly changed.
    On the basis of last year's Great Leap Forward, especially after the recent further rectification of the communes, the fishermen throughout the province are even more enthusiastic and motivated. Many fishing areas have launched production competitions between communes and communes, production teams and production teams, fishing boats and fishing boats. Fishermen on the Liu'ao Peninsula in Zhangpu County worked two tides a day, catching a total of 120,000 jin of fish in half a month, equivalent to the output of three and a half months in the same period last year. In order to work more hours and catch more fish, women in coastal areas replaced men in land-based work. Many women in fishing villages also broke with superstitious customs and went to sea for production. Forty-seven women on the Chongwu Peninsula in Huian went to sea to catch cuttlefish, catching more than 4,300 dan in just two days.
    The Fujian Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Provincial People's Committee attach great importance to fisheries production. In addition to issuing instructions to strengthen spring fishing production, the province has established a fishing season office, convened a spring fisheries production competition broadcast meeting listened to by 300,000 fishermen, and established fishing season production headquarters in key fishing grounds such as northeastern Fujian and Niu Mountain in Pingtan to strengthen the connection of information such as fish schools and weather, and the mutual cooperation of production, supply, and marketing departments. Commercial departments in various places have also strongly supported fisheries. The Sansha store is open all night to ensure supplies are available to fishing boats upon arrival. Commercial departments have also organized 6,000 tons of ships distributed to various fishing ports for timely purchase and transportation.

    福建渔业春汛大丰收
    前线渔民在对敌斗争中坚持捕鱼
    本报讯　目前，福建海面春汛大发海，坚持对敌斗争的前线渔民，在人民解放军海防部队保护下，勇猛追捕鱼群，八万多渔民驾着一万二千多条渔船，日夜奋战海洋，争取春汛丰收。今年1至4月，全省共捕捞各种海鱼二百二十万担，比大跃进的1958年同期增产十六万担。在淡水养殖方面也有很大发展，目前全省已孵化鱼苗十八亿尾，比去年增加十一倍。
    今年福建春汛来得早，一般都比去年提前半个月到一个月发海。由于渔民们在紧张的对敌斗争中及早作好迎接春汛的准备工作，突击抢修好渔船、渔网，因而提前半个月到一个月投入生产。全省最大春汛渔场在闽东北，这里有两万多渔民奋战在四礵、台山岛等海面。光三沙渔港，一个月就捕瓜鱼、鳗鱼等经济鱼类二万二千多担；今年墨鱼更是罕有的大发海，福鼎、霞浦二县六天中就捕获八万多担。
    在春汛生产中，各地渔民掀起了技术革新运动，实行多种捕捞作业，大量推广万能?、万能钓等新式渔具，因此大大提高单位捕鱼量。
    解放几年来，福建水产生产在不断发展中，1958年总产量达九百万担，比1949年解放那一年增加五点七倍。福建省水产生产获得巨大成就的主要原因，是党和政府领导渔民实现渔业生产合作化，特别是去年办了公社以后，大大便于改进技术，提高了生产效率；此外有人民解放军的积极援助，粉碎了敌人的抢劫、破坏，促进渔业年年丰收。国家还从经济上给渔民很大支持，发放了大批救济款和渔业贷款，帮助渔民解决生产和生活困难问题，大大提高了渔民生产的积极性。几年来，人民政府在重点渔区设立了暴风警报站、避风坞及四个气象站、一个渔业广播台，及时传播大风警报，许多渔船都装上了收音机，因而渔民的生命财产得到有效的保护，“天有不测风云”的状况大大改观了。
    全省渔民在去年大跃进的基础上，特别是最近进一步整顿公社后，生产积极性更高，干劲更足。不少渔区的公社与公社，生产队与生产队，渔船与渔船之间，互相挑起生产竞赛。漳浦县六鳌半岛渔民作到每日打鱼两个潮水，在半个月中，共计捕到十二万斤鱼，相当于去年同期三个半月的产量。为了多出工多打鱼，沿海妇女代替了男子在陆上作活。许多渔村妇女还打破迷信风俗，下海生产。惠安崇武半岛四十七个妇女下海捕墨鱼，仅二天就捕到四千三百多担。
    中共福建省委、省人委对渔业生产很重视，除发出加强春汛生产的指示外，省里成立了渔汛办公室，召开过有三十万渔民收听的春季渔业生产竞赛广播大会，并在闽东北、平潭牛山等重点渔场成立渔汛生产指挥部，加强渔群、气象等情报联系和产供销等各部门的互相配合。各地商业部门对渔业也大力支持。三沙商店开展通宵营业，保证渔船随到随供应。商业部门还组织了六千吨的船只分布各渔港，及时收购、调运。
