    New Rising Forces in the Music World
    Li Guoquan
    Recently (May 10th), I attended a concert performed by the Central Conservatory of Music. The majority of the participants were young students, full of energy and vigor on stage. I felt unspeakably happy to see so many young people with musical talent being nurtured and growing up under the care of the Party. They have a large orchestra of seventy or eighty people (aged approximately seventeen or eighteen to around twenty), capable of playing quite complex pieces, and a "Young Pioneer Orchestra" of dozens of people (aged from twelve or thirteen to fifteen), who can also show their skills on stage and do so quite wonderfully. The young pianist Liu Shikun, who won the second prize in the Tchaikovsky International Piano and Violin Competition in 1958, and the young soprano Guo Shuzhen, who returned from studying in the Soviet Union, also participated in the performance. In addition, there were programs such as a folk music trio and a male bass solo.
    This concert was very successful. In discussions with some friends, everyone praised it unanimously. The program arrangement was appropriate, the forms were diverse, and almost every program was warmly welcomed by the audience.
    The Three Slavonic Dances (by Dvořák) were played very vividly and enthusiastically. The bowing of the strings was neat, the breathing of the wind instruments was unified, and the voices were relatively balanced. As a student orchestra, this is an excellent one. The first Slavonic Dance (Opus 46 No. 8) has "repeats" in almost every section, so if it is not further arranged, it will appear plain. Comrade Huang Feili is an experienced conductor. The rhythm is stable (this is very important for a conductor) and the beat is clear, but the forte is still a little tight. In addition, in the arrangement of the wind orchestra program, it is okay to play three works with the same style and color at the same time, but in such a concert format, you can also consider changing one or two other works, such as Chinese works.
  The form of the Gaohu, Zither, and Yangqin trio is novel, and this attempt has aroused the interest of many colleagues. The three played well, and cooperated even better, but only this one program
  ("Spring in Xinjiang") is not enough, and it cannot fully display the characteristics of the zither and yangqin.
    Li Guanglun's male bass has a good voice and sings well. He sang three songs set to Mao Zedong's poems. As a freshman at the Conservatory of Music, it is not easy to sing to this extent.
    Guo Shuzhen's solo is quite outstanding. Her performance proves that the Soviet teaching methods are very convincing. Her characteristics are good technique (including accurate pitch, good rhythm, and free use of voice), careful handling of the works, and striving for perfect performance, but the only drawback is that the enthusiasm is not enough. For example, the aria of "Madame Butterfly" felt a little cold. Zhou Guangren's accompaniment was so emotional that it was deeply moving!
    Liu Shikun's performance of Tchaikovsky's First Piano Concerto is almost impeccable. As long as this young pianist makes unremitting efforts, there is no doubt that he will win greater glory for the motherland in the future. His characteristics are good technique and enthusiasm, but he needs to be more reserved. When playing some soft phrases, his body swayed a little too much. The orchestra's accompaniment can be said to be competent, and everyone can enter the musical mood, which is very good. Zhu Gongyi's conducting was well-measured, with good emotional and dynamic expression; but sometimes there was a disconnection with the soloist. It is necessary to give the soloist the maximum satisfaction.
    I especially want to talk about the "Young Pioneer Orchestra." I was very excited to see the performance of the innocent and lovely children. More than ten years ago, in the music group of the Yucai School, under the rule of the reactionaries, although it took a lot of effort, it was difficult to get the children's orchestra going. At that time, there were only a dozen strings, no woodwind instruments, so an accordion had to be used instead. Looking at today's "Young Pioneer Orchestra" is really not the same. They are very happy and have the opportunity to develop their specialties with the strong support of the country from an early age. From their ensemble, it can be seen that they all have talents and a strong sense of music. They play with great energy and are very touching. It would be more interesting to choose some lively and brisk small works in terms of selection.
    The students of the Central Conservatory of Music are the new rising forces in the music world of New China and a strong reserve force. They have already demonstrated this with practical actions. They will definitely make great contributions to the motherland's musical and cultural undertakings in the future!

    音乐界的新生力量
    黎国荃
    最近（5月10日）听了中央音乐学院演出的音乐会，参加这次演出的绝大部分是青少年学生，他们在台上个个精神饱满、神采焕发；那么多有音乐天才的青年和少年，在党的关怀下被培育起来，成长起来，心里感到说不出的高兴。他们有七、八十人的大管弦乐队（年龄大约从十七、八到二十左右），已经能够演奏相当复杂的乐曲，还有数十人的“红领巾乐队”（年龄从十二、三到十五左右），也能在舞台上大显身手，并且相当精彩。曾于1958年获得柴可夫斯基钢琴和小提琴国际比赛的钢琴比赛第二奖的青年钢琴家刘诗昆，及由苏联学习归来的青年女高音歌唱家郭淑贞也参加了演出，此外还有民乐三重奏及男低音独唱等节目。
    这次的音乐会是很成功的，同所接触的一些朋友们的谈论中，没有不是异口同声加以称赞的；节目的安排恰到好处，形式也多样，差不多每个节目都受到听众热烈欢迎。
    三个斯拉夫舞曲（德沃夏克作曲）演奏得很生动、很热情，弦乐的弓法整齐，管乐的呼吸统一，声部也比较平衡，作为一个学生乐队来说这是一个很出色的乐队。斯拉夫舞曲第一首（作品第46之8）由于作品本身几乎每段都有“反复”，如不进一步加以安排就会显得平淡，黄飞立同志是一位富有经验的指挥家，节奏稳定（对于一个指挥来说这是十分重要的）、击拍清晰，但在强奏时还嫌稍紧；此外在管弦乐这一组节目的安排上，同时演奏三个风格及色彩都相同的作品，固然可以，但在这样的音乐会形式中，也可考虑换一两首其他作品，如中国作品等。
  高胡、筝、扬琴三重奏的形式是新鲜的，这样的尝试引起了不少同行们的兴趣；三个人演奏得好，合作得更好，不过只有这一个节目
  （“新疆之春”）还嫌不够，也还不能充分发挥筝和扬琴的特点。
    李光伦的男低音，声音本质好，唱得也不错。他演唱了以毛主席的诗词谱的三首曲子，作为音乐学院一年级的学生，能唱到这样程度，已是不易的了。
    郭淑贞的独唱是相当杰出的，从她的演唱中可以证明苏联的教学方法是十分令人信服的。她的特点是技巧好（包括音准，节奏好，声音的运用自如），对作品处理细致，演唱时力求表现完善，但美中不足的是热情还不太够，如“蝴蝶夫人”的咏叹调，就稍感冷了一些。周广仁的伴奏是那样富于情感，深深令人感动！
    刘诗昆演奏的柴可夫斯基的第一钢琴协奏曲，几乎是无可非议的。这位年轻的钢琴家只要不懈的努力将来为祖国争得更大的荣誉是不用怀疑的。他的特点是技巧好，热情，但还需要含蓄一些，在演奏某些轻柔乐句时，身体摇晃得似乎过份了一些。乐队协奏可以说是称职的，每个人都能进入音乐情绪中去，这是非常好的。朱工一的指挥掌握得有分寸，情绪、力度表现均佳；但有时与独奏家还有脱节现象，给独奏家以最大限度的满足是必要的。
    我特别想说一下“红领巾乐队”，看了天真可爱的孩子们的演奏，心情是非常激动的。在十多年前，在育才学校音乐组的时候，在反动派统治下，虽费了九牛二虎之力，也难得把孩子乐队搞起来，那时只有十几个弦乐，没有木管乐器，只好以一架手风琴来代替。看看今天的“红领巾乐队”真是不可同日而语。他们是非常幸福的，从小就得到国家的大力培养，有发展专长的机会。从他们的合奏中可以看得出，他们个个都有才能，有强烈的音乐感，演奏起来很带劲儿，很动人；在选材上如能选些轻快活泼的小型作品就更有意思。
    中央音乐学院的同学们都是新中国音乐界的新生力量，是强有力的后备军，他们已经用实际行动说明了这一点；他们对祖国的音乐文化事业，将来一定会作出巨大的贡献！
