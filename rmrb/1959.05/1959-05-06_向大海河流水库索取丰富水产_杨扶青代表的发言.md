Chairman, fellow representatives:

I fully agree with and wholeheartedly support Premier Zhou Enlai's Government Work Report, Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the draft of the 1959 National Economic Plan, Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1958 National Final Accounts and the 1959 National Budget Draft, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen's Work Report of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. I will earnestly, widely, and deeply convey these reports to the grassroots level and resolutely implement them in my work.

1958 was a year of great leaps forward in socialist economic construction. Hebei Province, like all parts of the country, under the wise leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and illuminated by the general line of going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in building socialism, the people of the province have made brilliant achievements in all aspects of industrial, agricultural, and other production and construction. Now, I will only discuss the leap forward in aquatic production, based on my personal understanding, to illustrate how the people of Hebei Province, under the leadership of the Party, are striding forward towards the prospect of high yields, abundant harvests, and a happy life.

Hebei Province borders the Bohai Sea to the east, with a coastline of 790 li. The Bohai Bay is an inland sea area, with more than a hundred rivers flowing into it. The seabed is flat, the water temperature is moderate, and the bait is abundant. It is a spawning and foraging ground for various economic fish and shrimp species, and is rich in Acetes, prawns, yellow croaker, pomfret, mullet, hairtail, Miichthys miiuy, sea bass, flounder, bream, turbot, copper drum, puffer fish, noodle fish, etc., thus forming good fishing grounds. Various clams, cockles, oysters, sea snails, sea fans, and other self-grown algae grow along the coast. Qinhuangdao City's coastal area also produces valuable sea cucumbers. In recent years, artificial trials of fish, shrimp, shellfish, sea cucumbers, kelp, etc. have been successful. The prospect of developing marine aquaculture is very promising. Inland rivers crisscross the province, and lakes, depressions, and reservoirs are scattered like stars. There are more than 30 million mu of water surface, of which about 4 million mu can be currently used for aquaculture. With the continued development of water conservancy construction, the water surface will gradually expand and become stable, and freshwater aquaculture also has infinitely broad prospects for development. In the above-mentioned water surfaces, large quantities of carp, crucian carp, grass carp, mandarin fish, snakehead, catfish, silver carp, bream, red-eye trout, as well as valuable whitebait, sweetfish, and freshwater shrimp, river crabs, etc. are produced. The vast lakes and depressions also grow lush aquatic plants, such as lotus roots, water chestnuts, reeds, cattails, spikerush, etc. Aquatic plants and animals play a significant role in enlivening the rural economy, improving people's lives, and supplying industrial raw materials, livestock and poultry feed, and agricultural fertilizers.

Hebei Province's aquatic industry was long depressed before liberation. More than 100,000 fishermen suffered the arbitrary destruction of Japanese imperialism and the cruel exploitation of fishing capitalists, landlords, boat owners, fish trade associations, and usurers, living a life worse than that of animals, with their lives not guaranteed. After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, the Kuomintang reactionaries continued to destroy the fishing industry, imposing exorbitant taxes and levies, and creating difficulties at checkpoints, leaving the vast majority of fishermen in a tragic and impoverished state of "three destructions" (broken boats, broken nets, broken houses) and "five mores" (more debts, more selling of children, more manual labor, more begging, more bachelors). They were displaced, and production plummeted sharply. On the eve of liberation, the fishing population was only about 50,000, with an annual output of only 40,000 tons.

Establish fishing industry institutions, help fishermen improve production technology, and the fishing industry embarks on the road of great development

After liberation, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, democratic reforms were carried out in fishing areas, abolishing the feudal exploitation system and liberating productive forces. Aquatic product institutions were successively established in the province and in key fishing industry special districts, cities, and counties. Fishing loans were issued, fishing supplies were provided, fishermen were helped to transport and sell their products, various safety facilities were built to ensure fishermen's production safety, and aquatic scientific research institutions were established to help fishermen improve production technology. The broad masses of fishermen were led to organize and successfully complete the socialist transformation of the fishing industry, thereby transitioning the fishing industry from recovery to great development. By 1957, when the first Five-Year Plan was successfully completed, the province's aquatic production had grown to 157,000 tons, with an average annual increase rate of 12 percent, nearly tripling the output of 1949 and increasing by 69.3 percent compared to 1952. The lives of fishermen were not only free from the "three destructions and five mores," but also greatly improved. For example, in 1957, the average net income per laborer in Nanbu District, Luan County, was 528 yuan, with some earning more than 1,000 yuan, nearly doubling the income of 1949 and far exceeding the living standards of local middle peasants. This is enough to show that the development of aquatic production in Hebei Province is rapid. In 1958, the initial year of the more magnificent Second Five-Year Plan, a year of great leaps forward, aquatic production, like other production sectors, achieved unprecedented development: freshwater aquaculture area expanded from 20,000 mu in 1957 to about 900,000 mu, an increase of more than 40 times. All other cultivatable water surfaces were also managed. The scope of aquaculture was popularized throughout the province, basically meeting the requirement of utilizing all available water. Moreover, the policy of "collecting seedlings locally, cultivating them locally, and stocking them locally" was fully implemented, and artificial hatching of carp and harvesting of fish fry and fingerlings were carried out. The marine aquaculture area expanded from tens of thousands of mu to more than 200,000 mu. The output of marine fishing also increased by 61.5 percent compared to 1957, reaching 73,000 tons. The total output of fish, shrimp, crabs, and shellfish in the province reached more than 198,000 tons. At the same time, many high-yield "satellites" and large-area high-yield models emerged. The average yield of freshwater fish farming in Xushui County was 3,441 jin per mu, and the yield of a satellite field in Yangzhuangzi was more than 45,000 jin per mu. The average yield of fish and shrimp farming in Ninghe County was 722 jin per mu. The average single-boat yield of wind net boats in Hangu District was 200,000 jin. In other areas, high-yield ponds with yields of 10,000 jin, 20,000 jin, and more than 30,000 jin per mu also appeared. Wind net boats produced high-yield satellite boats with single-boat yields of more than 300,000 jin and more than 700,000 jin. Previously, harbor farming, which was always considered low-yield, also produced high-yield fields with yields of more than 1,000 jin per mu. Regarding this issue, some people may ask: Since there is a bumper harvest of aquatic products, why is there a shortage of fish supply on the market? We say that this question is easy to understand, and its reasons are also multifaceted: the annual increase in industrial and agricultural production, the universal increase in people's purchasing power, and the significant increase in social consumption, especially the consumption of food and clothing, are inevitable phenomena. And this increase is multifaceted. First of all, the urban industrial and construction population has increased, resulting in a significant increase in consumption. Most of these newly added populations come from rural areas, but since the establishment of people's communes and the communal dining halls, the vast majority of women have participated in labor, so rural consumption has not only not decreased, but has increased. Secondly, the non-staple foods consumed in urban industrial and mining areas mostly rely on rural supply. Due to the increase in the number of people employed and participating in labor in rural areas, the increase in income, and the significant increase in purchasing power, and the purchase of more and better goods, both urban and rural areas feel the supply is tight. Rural population in our province accounts for more than three-quarters of the total population. If each person eats five more jin of fish and shrimp per year, the number is quite alarming. Although the increased production cannot be entirely used to supply the cities, the supply in the cities has not decreased. Just take the fish supply in Tianjin for the 1959 Spring Festival as an example. It was more than 23 percent higher than in 1958. Providing each citizen with a prawn during the Spring Festival means 300,000 jin. Thirdly, there is also some artificial supply tension. In some cases where fish supply is temporarily insufficient, the sales staff's propaganda and explanation to the masses is not enough, causing psychological tension among the masses. Even things that they did not intend to buy or eat, they will buy and eat. Just take Tianjin as an example, with an average purchase of one or two per person per day, that is more than 300,000 jin. Over the long term, this number is quite considerable. It is not in accordance with the facts to deny the increase in production and to fail to see the increase in the purchasing power of the broad masses of people. As for the rumors and slanders of imperialism and reactionary elements, they are even more baseless and not worth refuting. As Premier Zhou pointed out in the Government Work Report, the imperialists are trying their best to obliterate the fact of our country's great leap forward, because they know that this fact will inevitably increase the belief of people all over the world in the superiority of socialism and deepen people's suspicion of the capitalist system. But no matter how hard they try, the facts cannot be obliterated, and their despicable attempts cannot be achieved.

Transplanting sea fish to dams, opening up abandoned seaports for fish farming, and creating many miracles in the Great Leap Forward

In the year of the Great Leap Forward, the broad masses of people also created many miracles based on emancipating their minds and breaking down superstitions: for example, freshwater prawn farming, which had failed in several previous experiments, has been successfully tested in the Great Leap Forward; carp and crucian carp hybridization; artificial hatching of soft-shelled turtles; trials of sea horses, mussels, pearl oysters, coypu, and using grass instead of grain as feed for fish fingerlings have all been successful. At the same time, we boldly tried the work of transplanting sea fish to dams, transporting mullet and sea cucumbers to the Bashang Plateau at an altitude of 1,500 meters for cultivation, and are continuing to try to cultivate kelp. The heroic slogans put forward by the people of Bashang, "Thousands of reservoirs, ten thousand valley embankments, raise fish wherever there is water" and "Turn the water marshes on the grassland into oceans," have become a reality. The technology of artificial hatching of carp has been popularized throughout the province. In the past year, the masses have built more than 30 small-scale fish fingerling farms with their own materials and financial resources. Now, the water surface of fingerling breeding ponds is about 200 mu, which not only creates extremely favorable conditions for the development of fingerling production in our province, but also fundamentally breaks the superstition that only the so-called four major fish species (grass carp, silver carp, bighead carp, and common carp) can be raised.

During the Great Leap Forward, the masses also made considerable leaps forward in tool improvement and technological innovation. What is more prominent is: In Huanghua County, Qikou Commune, due to the extreme shortage of Mao bamboo, one or two nets of the reel net are changed to one bamboo pole, which saves three-quarters to seven-eighths of the bamboo used; Tianjin Aquatic Products Supply Company comprehensively utilizes the waste of fish, shellfish, and shellfish to trial-produce chitin, guanine, fish scale glue, fish oil, fish meal... and other 26 new products; coastal areas have also coarsely made a large number of shell powder agricultural fertilizers. Due to the implementation of the policy of combining teaching with labor production, ten large and medium-sized aquatic colleges were established throughout the province using the method of work-study program, training more than 1,100 students, which laid a favorable foundation for carrying out technical revolution and cultural revolution in the future, and will cultivate a large number of red and expert technical talents for the aquatic industry in our province.

What is also worth mentioning is: During the Great Leap Forward, the enthusiasm of the broad masses of people soared to the sky. In 1958, under the brilliant illumination of the general line of building socialism, and under the guidance of the policy of "focusing on aquaculture and actively developing fishing," the people of the province quickly launched a vigorous and magnificent high tide of leap forward in aquatic production with the momentum of landslides and seas. In the freshwater fish farming areas, in the work of cleaning pits, rectifying ponds and rushing to stock, women, militiamen, young students and children in many areas participated in the battle, and the slogans put forward by elderly women and children were: "If we can't carry earth baskets, we will move them by hand, and we will move mountains by diligently going back and forth"; therefore, "March 8th Women's Fish Ponds", "Militia Ponds" and "Youth Ponds" were built everywhere. In terms of marine aquaculture, the broad masses of fishermen along the coast have brought into play the spirit of hard work, solid work and clever work, and have built one fish farm and shellfish farm after another with thousands of mu or tens of thousands of mu on the beaches and mudflats of seaports that have been abandoned for many years; the enthusiasm for marine fishing production to fight against nature is even greater, and many areas have broken the long-standing rule of not going to sea before the season in the history of fishery production. On the first day of the first lunar month, they smashed ice and pushed boats into the sea, and women who were considered unable to go out to sea on boats also broke the rules and went out of their homes to participate in fishing production. In order to overcome the difficulties of wind and frequent winds in their operations, the broad masses of fishermen put forward the heroic slogan of "Work hard in strong winds, work harder in light winds, and row even without wind"; thanks to the soaring enthusiasm of the masses, they finally overcame the natural disasters of strong winds and frequent winds at sea and drought and little rain on land in 1958, won the great leap forward, and opened up new avenues for the high-speed development of aquatic production in our province. While carrying out struggles with the natural world, the people of the whole province also opened up the boundaries between societies and societies, counties and counties, and special districts and special districts, and developed the spirit of communist great collaboration in mutually supporting labor, mutually supporting technology, and mutually supporting tools. For example, in the spring anti-drought campaign, some areas took the initiative to send processing personnel on land to support agricultural water conservancy projects; in the diversified production campaign, they took the initiative to dispatch personnel with fishing technology and transferred a large number of nets, fishing hooks, etc. to support brother societies and neighboring counties, which fully shows that the broad masses of people have not only achieved a great leap forward in production, but also a great leap forward in ideological awareness. These thousands of facts can only appear under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao! It is something that any capitalist country cannot dream of. The achievements we have made should first of all be attributed to the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, to the correctness of the general line; to the wisdom and unparalleled strength of the great people, and even more so to the immeasurable superiority of the people's commune!

Although our Hebei Province has achieved the above-mentioned achievements in aquatic production in 1958, our work and thinking are still far from catching up with and meeting the development and needs of the objective situation. In the future, we must work hard, study hard, improve our thinking, and actively create conditions in our work and production practice under the leadership of the Party, and strive for a double leap forward in work and thinking, so that we can adapt to the needs of the great leap forward in aquatic production in our province in 1959 as soon as possible.

While the people of the whole province are making a double leap forward in thinking and production, the people's commune has been universally realized in the countryside, which has created the best organizational form for our province to accelerate socialist construction and transition to communism. Like the rising sun, it illuminates the people of the whole province's forward goals, and it also illuminates the forward goals of aquatic production.

Find fishing grounds, reform fishing gear, combine multiple tools and rotate them, protect resources, ensure safe production, and comprehensively promote production increase measures

In order to continue to leap forward on the basis of the victory in 1958 and along the road opened up in 1958, and strive for a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in aquatic production in our province in 1959, the broad masses of farmers and fishermen in the province have invested in the vigorous and magnificent "spring fishing season" peak production after intense preparations last winter and this spring under the leadership of the Party. In marine fishing, the masses have grasped the characteristics of this year's warmer climate and earlier fishing season, and are promoting the five-character production increase measures that were effective last year, including "find" (find fishing grounds), "reform" (reform fishing gear), "combine" (combine multiple tools and rotate them), "protect" (protect resources), and "ensure" (ensure safe production), and launched a fishing production centered on production increase and economy, determined to actively and humbly learn from the advanced experience of Fujian and other provinces on the basis of winning the initial battle in cold sea production, improve our work, promote the double leap forward in marine aquaculture and fishing in our province, and strive for a bumper harvest of prawns and yellow croaker. Zhang Zhenshan Youth Production Group of Nanbu People's Commune in Leting County, because two people were injured and one person was sick and received long-term treatment and recuperation in the past two years, and the cooperative provided all the expenses, and the whole family's food and drink were free after the establishment of the commune; they deeply felt that socialism has many benefits and the people's commune has great superiority, and their ideological awareness has been greatly improved. In cold sea production, they went all out, aimed high, seized the time, tapped potential, used nature (used climate and wind direction), mastered the daily plan, and carried out personal competition. Although they used very small old fishing boats and fishing gear, in just forty days, they produced more than 9,000 jin of fish and shellfish, with an income of more than 1,000 yuan, exceeding the total output of five production groups of the same type by 81 percent. At the marine fishing on-site meeting held by Tangshan Prefectural Administration, the masses praised this group as "starting with four taels of iron" (a shell digging iron rake weighs four taels), and launched a movement to learn from the production experience of Zhang Zhenshan Group; Many experienced old fishermen or elderly commune members along the coast, after recalling the tragic life of "three destructions and five mores" before liberation and comparing it with the happy life of having nurseries and kindergartens for young children; nursing homes for the elderly, and free meals, have asked to go on board to participate in production. Elderly commune members are full of enthusiasm, and put forward the fighting slogans of: "With great determination and full of enthusiasm, production is like a fierce tiger, better than the old Huang Zhong", "Old people's hearts are not old, we will definitely engage in satellites", and launched competitions with the young and middle-aged commune members who are engaged in deep-sea operations. They increased the daily income of each net from six yuan to eight yuan. Through competition and tool reform, the commune members who are engaged in deep-sea operations extended the operation time and increased the output. As of April 15, the commune's marine fishing output has exceeded more than double the same period last year, and the world-famous prawns have produced 2.2 million jin in just 14 days. The spring stocking, artificial carp hatching, and natural egg collection work in freshwater fishery is due to the in-depth implementation of the policy of "collecting seedlings locally, cultivating them locally, and stocking them locally" and the conscientious promotion of the eight-character intensive farming experience of "water" (improving water quality, increasing water depth), "seed" (excellent and strong varieties), "feed" (sufficient feed), "density" (reasonable stocking density), "mix" (mixed stocking of multiple varieties), "rotate" (rotate catching and stocking), "prevent" (prevent and control fish diseases, eliminate pests), and "manage" (special personnel management). The spring preparations have been done better than in previous years. Generally, they have stored different quantities of parent fish and built small fish fingerling farms, and carried out a series of pit cleaning, pond rectification, and improved stocking technology. In marine aquaculture, various places are also carrying out the infrastructure projects of seaweed seedling separation and harbor construction for harbor aquaculture. And a technical innovation upsurge centered on improving labor productivity has been universally launched on the marine and freshwater aquaculture and fishing fronts. We will humbly and conscientiously learn from the advanced experience of fish farming in our province and other brother provinces, improve our work, and accelerate the double leap forward in freshwater aquaculture and fishing in our province. The broad masses of farmers and fishermen in the province are all working wholeheartedly to break through the seedling pass, the prawn pass, and achieve a comprehensive bumper harvest in aquatic production this year, and to dedicate gifts to the 10th anniversary of the National Day. Party and government leaders at all levels and aquatic workers are also going deep into the grassroots, on boats, into ponds, and into factories, participating in labor or experimental fields; and are striving to complete and strive to overfulfill the various targets given to us by the state in every possible way!

We firmly believe that with the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, the superior system of the people's commune, and the unparalleled soaring enthusiasm and creative wisdom of the broad masses of people, we will definitely be able to achieve a greater victory than in 1958 this year.

Finally, I am extremely resentful of the former Tibetan local government and the upper-class reactionary group plotting an armed rebellion in Tibet with British imperialism and Indian expansionist elements! Especially, I am even more indignant that the so-called "Declaration of the Dalai Lama" was actually published in India, a great friendly country that adheres to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and that Indian diplomatic officials distributed it on their behalf, disregarding the friendly relations between China and India! This small group of reactionary traitorous groups in Tibet, in order to maintain the feudal, dark, cruel oppression and exploitation of the serf system, and vainly trying to permanently retain the reactionary forces of the ruling class, launched an armed rebellion, which completely violated the interests of the 1.2 million people of Tibet and the people of all ethnic groups in the country. This heinous crime of undermining the unity of the motherland and national unity has been resolutely opposed by the people of all ethnic groups in the country, especially the broad masses of monks and lay people in Tibet, and has therefore been shamefully defeated. The government's order to dissolve the Tibetan local government and completely quell the rebellion in Tibet is completely correct, and I firmly express my heartfelt support.

Of course, the imperialists, foreign reactionaries, and the remaining domestic counter-revolutionaries will never be reconciled, because our victory is their defeat. They must do everything possible to fabricate and make false accusations in an attempt to split our country's national unity and undermine our country's unification and peaceful construction. But the awakened broad masses of all ethnic groups in the new China will never be fooled, and can defeat any conspiracy to sabotage and aggression against our country. The slander and attacks of imperialism and Indian interventionist elements against us have, as a result, served as negative teachers for us, enabling the people of all ethnic groups in our country to be more vigilant, unite more closely around the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and build a prosperous and strong new China. I sincerely hope that the Dalai Lama can get rid of his passive, coerced, and unfree and desolate situation as soon as possible, and quickly return to the motherland to build a bright and happy new Tibet and a prosperous and strong new China together with the Tibetan people and the people of the whole country; and I solemnly advise the impulsive followers in the former Tibetan local government and the upper-class reactionary group to know that the government is generous and does not blame the past. You must repent as soon as possible, turn back to the shore, which is your bright future!

I further solemnly warn the British imperialists and Indian expansionist elements that the rebellion you have planned is nothing more than soap bubbles, which cannot withstand a strong easterly wind! The evil consequences you have caused are bound to be a shameful failure! The Chinese people who have stood up have forever got rid of the era of being manipulated in our internal affairs. If anyone overestimates themselves, they will inevitably be smashed to pieces in front of the mighty Chinese people!

If there are any inappropriate points in the above speech, please give me your guidance!

专栏：

　　向大海河流水库索取丰富水产
    杨扶青代表的发言主席、各位代表：
    我完全同意并衷心拥护周恩来总理的政府工作报告，李富春副总理的关于一九五九年国民经济计划草案的报告，李先念副总理的关于一九五八年国家决算和一九五九年国家预算草案的报告，彭真副委员长的全国人民代表大会常务委员会的工作报告，并认真广泛深入地向基层传达，在工作中坚决贯彻执行。
    一九五八年是社会主义经济建设大跃进的一年，河北省和全国各地一样，在共产党和毛主席的英明领导下，在鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义总路线的光辉照耀下，全省人民在工农业及其他生产建设各个方面，都取得了辉煌成就。现在仅就我个人了解的一些水产生产的跃进情况，来说明河北省的人民怎样在党的领导下，向着高额丰产幸福生活的前景阔步前进。
    河北省东临渤海，海岸线长达七百九十华里，渤海湾是个内海区，有百余条河川汇流注入其中，海底平坦，水温适度，饵料丰富，是多种经济鱼虾类的产卵场和索饵场，盛产毛虾，对虾、黄花鱼、鱠鱼、鮻鱼、带鱼、鳘鱼、鲈鱼、比目鱼、鲷鱼、?鱼、铜罗鱼，河豚鱼、面条鱼等，因而形成了良好的渔场：沿海生长着各种蛏、蚶、牡蛎、海螺、海扇等贝类及其他自生藻类，秦皇岛市沿海又生产珍贵的海参；近年来经过人工试养鱼、虾、贝、海参、海带等均获得成功；发展海水养殖的前途，大有可为。内陆河流纵横，淀、洼、水库星罗棋布，约有水面三千余万亩，目前可能养殖的就有四百万亩左右，随着水利建设的继续开展，水面将日益扩大，并趋于稳定，淡水养殖也具有无限广阔的发展前途。在上述水面中大量产有鲤、鲫、草、鳜、鳢、鲶、鲢、鲂、红眼鳟以及名贵的银鱼、香鱼和青虾、河蟹等，广大的淀洼中还生长着繁茂的水产植物，如、藕、鸡头、菱角、苇、蒲、皮条……等，水生动植物对于活跃农村经济，改善人民生活，供应工业原料、牲畜、家禽饲料、农业肥料具有重大作用。
    河北省的水产事业，在解放前长期不振，十余万渔业人口，饱尝日本帝国主义的任意摧残和渔业资本家、堡主、船主、鱼行栈、高利贷者的残酷剥削，过着牛马不如，生命难保的生活；抗战胜利后，国民党反动派依旧摧残渔业，苛捐杂税，关卡刁难，使广大渔民在生产和生活上处于三破（破船、破网、破房子）、五多（欠债的多、卖儿女的多、扛活的多、要饭的多、光棍汉多）的悲惨雕敝境地；流离失所，生产急剧下降。解放前夕渔业人口仅剩五万人左右，年产量仅四万吨。
　　建立渔业机构，帮助渔民改进生产技术，渔业走上大发展的道路
    解放后在中国共产党和人民政府的领导下，渔区进行了民主改革，废除了封建剥削制度，解放了生产力。省和重点渔业的专、市、县先后设立了水产机构，发放渔贷、供应渔需、帮助渔民运销产品，建设各项安全设施保障渔民生产安全，建立水产科学研究机构，帮助渔民改进生产技术、领导广大渔民组织起来胜利地完成了渔业社会主义改造；从而渔业由恢复走向了大发展。全省水产生产量到第一个五年计划胜利完成的一九五七年时，就增长到十五点七万吨，每年平均递增率为百分之十二，比一九四九年的产量增加将近三倍，比一九五二年的产量增加百分之六十九点三。渔民的生活，不仅是“三破、五多”早就一去不复返了，而且还有了很大提高。如：一九五七年原滦县南堡区每个劳动力平均纯收入五百二十八元，最多的一千多元，比一九四九年的收入增长将近一倍，远远超过了当地中农的生活水平；这足以说明河北省的水产生产发展是迅速的。在跨入更加宏伟的第二个五年计划初期一九五八年，这个大跃进的年代中，水产生产也和其他生产一样，获得了空前的大发展：淡水养殖面积由一九五七年的两万亩，发展到九十万亩左右，增长四十多倍，其余可养的大水面也都管养起来了，养殖范围普及到全省，基本上达到了有水皆利用的要求；并且全面地贯彻了“就地取苗，就地培育，就地放养”的方针，开展了鲤鱼人工孵化和鱼苗鱼种的捕捞生产。海水养殖面积由几万亩发展到二十多万亩；海洋捕捞产量也比一九五七年的七点三万吨增长百分之六十一点五；全省鱼虾、蚧、贝类的总产量达到十九点八万多吨。同时还出现了许许多多高额丰产“卫星”和大面积丰产典型。徐水县淡水养鱼平均亩产三千四百四十一斤，杨庄子一亩卫星田亩产四万五千多斤，原宁河县港养鱼虾平均亩产七百二十二斤；汉沽区风网船平均单产二十万斤。其他各地也出现了亩产一万斤、二万斤、三万多斤的高额丰产塘。风网船出现了单船产量三十多万斤，七十多万斤的高产卫星船，过去人们一向认为低产的港养也出现了亩产千斤以上的丰产田。对这个问题，也许有人会问：既然是水产丰收了，为什么市场上还出现了鱼货供应紧张的情况？我们说，这个问题很容易理解，它的原因也是多方面的：工农业生产逐年增加，人民购买力普遍提高，社会消费量特别是吃的穿的消费量大大增加，这是必然的现象。而这种增加又是多方面的。首先是城市工业、建筑人口增多，因而消费量大大增加；这些新增的人口大多来自农村，但自人民公社成立，食堂化后，广大妇女参加了劳动，因而农村消费量不只没有减少，反有所增加。其次是城市工矿区消费的副食品，大部分依靠农村供应，由于农村就业参加劳动的人数增加，收入增多，购买力大大提高，而且买的多、买的好，因而城乡都感到供应紧张。我省农村人口占总人口数的四分之三以上，每人按一年多吃五斤鱼虾计算，这个数目字就相当惊人。增加的生产量虽不能悉数拿出供应城市，但是城市的供应量也并未减少，仅说天津市一九五九年春节的鱼货供应吧，就比一九五八年提高百分之二十三以上，春节供应市民每人一个对虾，就是三十万斤。第三，人为的供应紧张也是有的，在某些鱼货暂时供应不足的情况下，由于售货人员对群众宣传解释工作做的不够，给群众造成心理紧张，本打算不买或不吃的东西，也要买点、吃点，就拿天津一个城市来计算，一天一个人平均买一两就是三十多万斤，长期算起来，这个数字确是相当可观。不承认生产量增加，看不到广大人民购买力提高，是不符合事实的。至于帝国主义和反动分子的造谣诬蔑，更是毫无根据的，也不值得一驳。正如周总理在政府工作报告中指出的，帝国主义竭力抹煞我国大跃进的事实，因为他们知道，这个事实不可避免的要增加全世界人民对于社会主义优越性的信念，加深人们对资本主义制度的怀疑。但是他们费尽了心思，事实总是不能抹煞的，他们的卑鄙企图也是不能达到的。
　　移殖海鱼上坝，开辟荒废海港养鱼，大跃进中创造了许多奇迹
    大跃进的一年中，广大群众在解放思想，破除迷信的基础上，还创造了不少的奇迹：如几次试验未获成功的淡水养对虾在大跃进中已经试养成功；鲤鲫杂交；元鱼人工孵化；试养海马、贻贝、珍珠贝、海狸鼠、以草类代替粮食作鱼种的饲料等等均获得了成功。同时我们还大胆尝试了海鱼上坝的移殖工作，把鮻鱼和海参运到海拔一千五百公尺的坝上高原饲养，并且还正在继续试养海带。坝上群众提出的“千库万谷坊，有水就养鱼”和“把草原上的水淖变成海洋”的豪迈口号已成事实。鲤鱼人工孵化的技术已经普及到全省，一年来群众以自己的物力和财力就修建小型鱼种场三十多处，现在培育鱼种池水面约有二百亩；这不仅为我省发展鱼种生产创造了极为有利的条件，而且从根本上破除了只有所谓青、草、鲢、鳙四大家鱼种才能养的迷信。
    在大跃进的同时，群众对于工具改进、技术革新也相当地跃进。较突出的是：黄骅县歧口公社为了毛竹极端缺乏，把转轴网的一个网或两个网改用一个竹杆，这样就节约用竹四分之三到八分之七；天津市水产供应公司综合利用鱼介贝类的废物、试制出甲壳质、鸟粪素、鱼鳞胶、鱼油、鱼粉……等二十六种新产品；沿海各地更粗制了大量的贝壳粉农业用肥料，由于贯彻了教学与劳动生产相结合的方针，全省以勤工俭学的方法，就建立起大中水产院校十处，培养学员一千一百多人，这就给今后开展技术革命、文化革命，打下了有利基础，并且将为我省的水产事业培养出大批又红又专的技术人材。
    还值得提到的是：在大跃进中广大群众的干劲冲天，一九五八年全省人民，在建设社会主义总路线的光辉照耀下，在“以养为主，积极发展捕捞”的方针指导下，以排山倒海之势，迅速地掀起了轰轰烈烈的水产生产跃进高潮。淡水鱼区在清坑整池和突击放养的工作中，很多地区的妇女、民兵、青年学生和少年儿童都参加了战斗，老年妇女和少年儿童提出的口号是：“抬不动土筐用手搬，勤来勤去搬倒山”；因而到处修建起来了“三八妇女养鱼池”，“民兵池”和“青年池”等等。在海水养殖方面，沿海广大渔民，发挥了苦干实干巧干的精神，在荒废多年的海港滩涂上，建设了几千亩几万亩的一处一处的养鱼港和养贝场；海洋捕捞生产向自然搏斗的干劲更大，很多地区都打破了渔业生产有史以来不到季节不出海的陈规，正月初一即砸冰推船下海，被人们认为不能出海上船的妇女，也打破常规走出家门参加了捕捞生产。广大渔民为了克服风大风多作业中的困难，他们提出了“大风小干，小风大干，无风摇橹也干”的豪迈口号；由于群众的干劲冲天，终于战胜了一九五八年海上风大风多和陆地上天旱雨少的自然灾害，夺得了大跃进，给高速度发展我省水产生产开辟了新的途径。全省人民在和自然界开展斗争的同时，还打开了社与社、县与县、专与专之间的界线，发扬了互相支援劳力，互相支援技术，互相支援工具的共产主义的大协作的精神。如在春季抗旱运动中，有的地区主动抽出陆地上的加工人员支援农业兴修水利工程；在开展多样化生产运动中，主动地派遣具有捕捞技术的人员和抽调大批的网具、钓钩等支援兄弟社和友邻县，这就充分说明了广大群众不仅在生产上获得了大跃进，而且在思想觉悟上也同样地获得了大跃进。这些千千万万的事迹，只有在共产党和毛主席的领导下才能出现！是任何资本主义国家所梦想不到的。这些成绩的取得，应该首先归功于党和毛主席的英明领导，归功于总路线的方针正确；归功于伟大的人民群众智慧和无比力量，更大大证明了人民公社伟大无比的优越性！
    一九五八年我们河北省在水产生产方面虽然取得了如以上所述的成就，但是我们的工作和思想还是远远没有赶上和满足客观形势的发展和需要。我们今后一定在党的领导下，在生产实践和工作中，努力工作，认真学习，提高思想，积极创造条件，力争工作思想双跃进，尽快地能够适应一九五九年我省水产大跃进的需要。
    全省人民在思想生产双跃进的同时，农村中普遍地实现了人民公社化，这就为我省创造了一个加速建设社会主义和过渡到共产主义的最好组织形式。它像初升太阳一样，照耀着全省人民的前进目标，也同样地照亮了水产生产的前进目标。
    寻找渔场、改革网具、多种工具兼做轮作，保护资源，安全生产，全面推行增产措施
    为了在一九五八年胜利的基础上，沿着一九五八年所开辟的道路，继续跃进，争取一九五九年我省水产生产获得更大更好更全面的跃进。全省广大农渔民在党的领导下经过去冬今春的紧张备战，已经投入了轰轰烈烈波澜壮阔的“春渔汛”的旺季生产。在海洋捕捞方面，群众掌握了今年气候较暖、渔汛来的早的特点，正在推行着“找”（寻找渔场）、“改”（改革网具）、“兼”（多种工具兼作轮作）、“保”（保护资源）、“安”（安全生产）去年行之有效的五字增产措施，开展了以增产节约为中心的捕捞生产，决心要在冷海生产初战获捷的基础上，积极谦虚地学习福建和其他省的先进经验，改进我们的工作，促进我省海洋养捕双跃进，力争对虾、黄花鱼的大丰收。乐亭县南堡人民公社张振山青年生产小组，因近二年两人受伤、一人生病长期治疗休养、均由合作社供给费用，公社成立后全家老少吃喝又不要钱；深深感到社会主义好处多，人民公社优越性大，思想觉悟大大提高，在冷海生产中，鼓足干劲，力争上游，抓紧时间，挖潜力，利用自然（利用气候和风向）、掌握日计划、开展个人竞赛的办法，虽使用的很小的旧渔船渔具，仅仅四十天的时间，就生产鱼、贝类九千多斤，收入一千余元，超过同种作业五个生产小组产量总和的百分之八十一，在唐山专署召开的海洋捕捞现场会议上，群众称赞这个小组是“四两铁起家”（一个抠贝的铁扒子有四两重），并开展了学习张振山小组生产经验的运动；沿海许多有经验的老渔民或老年社员，经过回忆解放前“三破、五多”的悲惨生活与现在幼有托儿所、幼儿园；老有敬老院，吃饭不要钱的幸福生活来对比，纷纷要求上船参加生产，老年社员都是干劲冲天，并提出了：“决心大、干劲足、生产恰似猛老虎，赛过当年老黄忠”，“人老心不老，定把卫星搞”的奋战口号，与深海作业的青壮年社员开展竞赛，他们由每条网日收入六元，增加到八元，深海作业的社员们通过竞赛和工具改革，延长了作业时间，提高了产量。到四月十五日全社海洋捕捞产量已超过去年同期一倍多，名闻中外的对虾，仅十四天就生产了二百二十万斤。淡水渔业方面的春季放养、鲤鱼人工孵化和采捕天然卵的工作由于深入地贯彻执行了“就地取苗、就地培育、就地放养”的方针和认真推行了“水”（改良水质、增加水深）、“种”（品种优良健壮）、“饵”（饵料充足）、“密”（合理密放）、“混”（多品种混合放养）、“轮”（轮捕轮放）、“防”（防治鱼病、清除敌害）、“管”（专人管理）的八字精养经验，春季准备比往年做的都出色，一般地都储备了数量不同的亲鱼和修建了小型的鱼种场，并且进行了一系列清坑整池和改进放养技术的工作。海水养殖，各地也正在紧张的进行着海带分苗、港养建港的基建工程。并且在海淡水养捕战线上普遍地掀起了以提高劳动生产率为中心的技术革新高潮。虚心认真地学习本省和其他兄弟省养鱼的先进经验，改进我们工作，加速我省淡水养捕双跃进。全省广大农渔民都在一心一意地为突破苗种关、对虾关实现今年水产生产全面大丰收，向国庆十周年献礼而努力劳动着。各级党政领导水产工作者也正在深入基层，上船下塘下厂，参加劳动或试验田；千方百计地为胜利完成并力争超额完成国家所给我们的各项指标而奋斗！
    我们完全坚信，有党和毛主席的领导，有人民公社的优越制度，有广大人民群众无比的冲天干劲和创造智慧，我们今年一定能够取得比一九五八年更大的胜利。
    最后，我对原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团同英帝国主义、印度扩张主义分子策划西藏武装叛乱，是万分痛恨！尤其是对所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”，竟发表在奉行和平共处五项原则的伟大友邦印度，而印度外交官员竟不顾中印友好关系代为分发，更加愤慨！西藏这一小撮反动叛国集团，为了维护封建黑暗残酷压迫剥削的农奴制度，妄想长期保留统治阶级的反动势力，而发动的武装叛乱，完全违背了西藏一百二十万人民和全国各族人民的利益，这种破坏祖国统一和民族团结的滔天罪行，立即受到了全国各族人民的坚决反对，特别是西藏广大僧俗人民的反对，因而很快地就遭到了可耻的失败。政府下令解散西藏地方政府，彻底平息西藏的叛乱，是完全正确的，我坚决表示衷心的拥护。
    当然帝国主义、外国反动派和国内残余的反革命分子，他们是绝对不会甘心的，因为我们的胜利就是他们的失败，他们一定是千方百计地弄虚作假，企图分裂我国的民族团结，破坏我们祖国的统一和和平建设，但是已经醒觉了的新中国各民族的广大人民是绝不会上当的，而且能够击败任何对我国的阴谋破坏和侵略。帝国主义和印度干涉主义分子对我们进行这样那样的诬蔑和攻击，其结果是给我们做了反面教员，使我国各族人民更能提高警惕，紧密团结在中国共产党和毛主席的周围，来建设繁荣富强的新中国。我在此殷切希望达赖喇嘛能早日摆脱被动劫持不自由的凄凉处境，迅速回到祖国，同西藏人民与全国人民一道共同建设光明幸福的新西藏，繁荣富强的新中国；并且郑重劝告原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团中的盲动胁从分子应该知道，政府宽大为怀，不咎既往，你们必须及早憣然悔改，回头是岸，才是你们的光明大道！
    我更严正警告英帝国主义和印度扩张主义分子，你们所策划的叛乱，不过是肥皂泡沫，是经不起强大东风的一吹！你们所招致的恶果，必然注定自身可耻的失败！站立起来的中国人民，已经永远摆脱了任人摆布我国内政的时代，如果有人不自量的话，那么在强大中国人民面前，就一定要碰得头破血流！
    以上发言，不妥之处，请各位代表给予指导！
