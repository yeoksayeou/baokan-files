Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 14th: Workers at the Red Flag No. 1 electric furnace of Daye Steel Plant have achieved daily and shift-based completion of their plans in early May, realizing "daily red, shift red." In the first ten days of this month, the workers of this electric furnace overfulfilled the daily production plan by an average of 5%, increasing the average daily output by about 15% compared with the last ten days of April; the quality of the steel all met the specifications, and production was carried out according to variety.

The reason why the workers of the Red Flag No. 1 electric furnace can achieve high quality and high yield is mainly because they implemented the method of "everyone grasping the plan, every shift grasping the plan, every furnace grasping the plan, and every process grasping the plan." Furthermore, around the plan and key production points, they rationally adjusted labor organization, implemented fixed personnel, fixed positions, and fixed tasks, and established systems such as "pre-shift arrangement, mid-shift inspection, pre-furnace analysis, and post-shift summary," strengthening production management so that measures to ensure production quantity and quality are tightly linked and implemented. For example, on May 2nd, the first furnace of steel produced by Wu Quanfu's shift did not meet the planned requirements. The entire shift of workers immediately held a meeting to check and found that the furnace bottom had slag buildup, reducing the volume. They immediately cleaned the furnace bottom despite the high temperature, and the output of the second furnace exceeded the plan. In the end, they overfulfilled the shift plan.

Learning the latest smelting technology and the experience of fraternal furnaces, and strengthening mutual cooperation, is also a reason why the workers of the Red Flag No. 1 electric furnace achieved high quality and high yield. In early May, the electric furnace workers, in response to the key issues of long melting and refining times, learned five major advanced technologies and advanced operating methods, such as "mixed slag steelmaking," which shortened the average smelting time per furnace from three hours in April to less than two and a half hours, and increased the utilization coefficient from 17.5 in April to more than 21.5. In addition to resolutely following operating procedures in production, the workers of the three electric furnace shifts strictly implemented the system of creating conditions for the next shift. As soon as they discover an abnormal situation, they immediately repair it or take furnace protection measures, and never delay for fear of affecting the task of their own shift. (Attached picture)

### 班前布置  班中检查  班后小结  大冶一号电炉优质高产

    班前布置  班中检查  班后小结
    大冶一号电炉优质高产
    新华社武汉14日电　大冶钢厂红旗一号电炉的工人，在5月上旬做到按日按班完成计划，实现了日日红、班班红。在这个月的前十天里，这个电炉的工人们，平均超额5％完成日生产计划，比4月下旬的平均日产量提高15％左右；钢的质量全部合乎规格，并且做到了按品种生产。
    红旗一号电炉的工人能实现优质高产，主要是由于他们实行了“人人抓计划，班班抓计划，炉炉抓计划，道道工序抓计划”的办法，并且围绕着计划和生产关键，合理调整劳动组织，实行定人、定位、定任务，建立“班前布置、班中检查、炉前分析、班后小结”等制度，加强了生产管理，使保证生产数量和质量的措施，环环扣紧、落实。如5月2日，吴全福班第一炉钢没有达到计划要求，全班工人便立即开会检查，发现炉底涨渣，缩小了容积，他们马上冒着高温清洗了炉底，第二炉的产量就超过了计划，最后还超额完成了班计划。
    学习最新冶炼技术和兄弟炉的经验，加强相互之间的协作，也是红旗一号电炉工人达到优质高产的原因。5月上旬，电炉工人们针对熔炼和精炼时间长的关键，学习了“同炉渣混合炼钢”等五项重大先进技术和先进操作法，使每炉钢的平均冶炼时间由4月份的三小时缩短到两小时半以下，利用系数由4月份的十七点五提高到二十一点五以上。电炉三个班的工人，在生产中除了坚决按操作规程办事以外，并且严格执行了上班为下班创造条件的制度。他们一发现有不正常的情况，立即检修或采取护炉措施，决不因为怕影响本班任务而拖延。（附图片）
