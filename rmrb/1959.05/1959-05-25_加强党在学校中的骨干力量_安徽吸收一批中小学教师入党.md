    Strengthening the Party's Backbone in Schools
    Anhui Absorbs a Batch of Primary and Secondary School Teachers into the Party

    (This newspaper) News - Since last year, Party organizations in various parts of Anhui Province have admitted more than 1,780 outstanding primary and secondary school teachers into the Party, strengthening the Party's backbone in schools.

    The new Party members who were developed are all outstanding members who have been cultivated and educated by the school Party branches for a long time, and have been strictly examined and absorbed according to the conditions of Party members. Before and after joining the Party, they were very active and responsible in their work and could unite the masses to find ways to overcome difficulties, so that all work has greatly improved. Tao Cheng, a teacher at Wuhu No. 1 Middle School, showed a firm stance and was consistently active and responsible in various movements before joining the Party. After joining the Party, he showed great enthusiasm in his work and could unite and lead the masses to complete tasks together. The senior three (1) class of the school was originally the worst class. After he became the head teacher, due to strengthening the political and ideological education of the students in the class, the students made significant progress in their studies and moral character. Wang Mingxian, a teacher at Wuhu No. 11 Middle School, was active and down-to-earth in his work before joining the Party, and could work hard to study things he did not understand. For example, the Party branch assigned him to be responsible for running a bacterial fertilizer factory. Under the conditions of lack of equipment and technology, he finally overcame the difficulties and set up a bacterial fertilizer factory, and was therefore selected as a representative to attend the city's socialist construction activists' conference. Jiang Liu, the deputy director of education at Anqing No. 3 Middle School, had just been transferred from the army to work at the school and was not very familiar with the work. He could persist in hard study and hard work, so that his teaching level continued to improve. For example, he originally taught first-year Chinese, but later continued to teach the class until the third year. Jiao Mingshi, a teacher at Wangzhai Township Primary School in Xiaoxian County, made a lot of teaching aids in his teaching work, which rapidly improved the quality of teaching. In the six grades sampled by the tutoring group in the second semester of 1958, the average score of each grade was above 90 points.

    Many primary and secondary school teachers regard the exemplary actions of the new Party members as their own example, and are determined to improve their ideological awareness, work hard to do their own work, and strive to join the Party as soon as possible.

    加强党在学校中的骨干力量
    安徽吸收一批中小学教师入党
    本报讯　安徽省各地党组织，去年以来接收了一千七百八十多名优秀中小学教师入党，加强了党在学校中的骨干力量。
    发展的这批新党员都是学校党支部长期培养教育的优秀分子，并根据党员的条件进行严格考查吸收的。他们在入党前后，工作都很积极负责，能团结群众一起想办法克服困难，因而使各项工作都有很大的起色。芜湖一中教员陶诚身入党前，在各项运动中表现立场坚定，工作一贯积极负责，入党后在工作中表现干劲大，能团结带动群众共同完成任务。该校高三（一）班，原来是最差的一个班，在他任班主任后，由于加强了对该班学生的政治思想教育，学生们的学习和品德方面都有显著的进步。芜湖市十一中教员汪明贤入党前工作积极踏实，对自己不懂的东西能刻苦钻研。如党支部分配他负责办细菌肥料厂，在设备缺和无技术的条件下，终于克服了困难，办起了细菌肥料厂，因而被选为出席市社会主义建设积极分子大会的代表。安庆三中副教导主任江流，刚从部队转业到学校工作，业务不太熟悉，他能坚持苦学苦钻，使教学水平不断地提高，如原来是教初一语文课的，后来一直跟班教到初三。萧县王砦乡小学教员焦明诗，在教学工作中制造了很多的教具，使教学质量得到迅速提高，1958年下学期辅导组抽考的六次成绩中，各年级平均分数都在九十分以上。
    很多中小学教员都把新党员的模范行动作为自己的榜样，决心提高自己的思想觉悟，努力做好自己的工作，争取早日入党。
