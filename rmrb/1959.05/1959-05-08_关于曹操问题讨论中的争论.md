　　Debate on the Discussion of Cao Cao's Issue

Since the publication of Guo Moruo's "Rehabilitating Cao Cao" in this newspaper on March 23, the question of how to evaluate Cao Cao has aroused more widespread and in-depth discussion. During this period, in addition to Guangming Daily continuing this discussion, Shanghai Wenhui Daily and Guangzhou Yangcheng Evening News also participated in the discussion. Shanghai Liberation Daily, Shandong Dazhong Daily, Tianjin Daily and other newspapers also published articles exploring the issue. Fudan University in Shanghai, East China Normal University, South China Normal College, Anhui Provincial Association of Philosophy and Social Sciences, Jiangsu Normal College, Tianjin Normal University, Peking University and other universities and scientific research units also held discussion meetings and launched heated debates. From late March to early May, about sixty articles and reports were published in newspapers and periodicals. In the discussion, there was generally no dispute about Cao Cao's contributions to Chinese history, that Cao Cao should be seen as a positive figure, and that Cao Cao should be rehabilitated. However, there were many different opinions regarding the extent of this rehabilitation, the evaluation of certain behaviors and measures of Cao Cao, and the interpretation of certain historical materials. The main issues of contention were: (1) the purpose of the Yellow Turban peasant uprising; (2) Cao Cao's policy of military agricultural colonies (tuntian); (3) whether Cao Cao was a national hero; (4) how to evaluate historical figures.

　　Whether Cao Cao's fight against the Yellow Turbans violated the purpose of the Yellow Turban uprising

This issue has become the focus of current debate. Many people disagree with Guo Moruo's assertion that "although Cao Cao fought against the Yellow Turbans, he did not violate the purpose of the Yellow Turban uprising" and that he "organized the Yellow Turbans." For example, Luo Yaojiu believes that "the purpose of the peasant uprising was to have a small piece of land of their own," but Cao Cao did not satisfy this requirement. Instead, he "reorganized some of the surrendered Yellow Turban troops as his subordinates, the so-called Qingzhou soldiers, and disarmed the majority of the peasant uprising troops, returning them to their farming tools to become his serfs. This is what is meant by the tuntian households." Tan Qixiang believes that "the basic demand of the peasants was land, that the tillers should have their land, and that taxes should be light. But Cao Cao's measures placed the peasants on state-owned land, carrying out serf-like production under the direct control of agricultural officials." How can it be said that he did not violate the purpose of the Yellow Turban uprising? According to Guo Moruo's statement, "it seems that Cao Cao, who came from a family of high-ranking bureaucrats and landlords, actually replaced the Yellow Turbans in achieving their own unattained goals, and became the leader of the peasant army and the representative of the peasant class." Shi Yi believes that "many of the measures taken by Cao Cao later to make concessions to the peasants were actually the implementation and development of the political views of the 'partisans.' It is more correct to say that Cao Cao inherited the tradition of the social reformers of the late Han Dynasty. However, the Yellow Turban uprising army had a completely different nature." Judging from the social development at that time, the activities of the Yellow Turbans, and certain records of Zhang Lu's measures in Hanzhong, the peasants still demanded land and, from a utopian socialist point of view, demanded a society where everyone had food to eat. In the struggle against the powerful clans, Cao Cao was indeed an ally of the peasants to a certain extent and for a certain period. However, the political force represented by Cao Cao was not a revolutionary faction, while the Yellow Turbans were a thorough revolutionary faction. Therefore, Cao Cao could not inherit the revolutionary tradition of the Yellow Turbans, who were the enemies of the landlord class. Some people opposed this view. For example, Rong Sheng believes that the Yellow Turban uprising was an early peasant movement in Chinese feudal society, and social revolution was not yet on the agenda. "The tillers have their land" could only be put forward under certain historical conditions. It was impossible for a peasant uprising more than a thousand years ago to put forward such a demand. The peasants' demand for land did not equal the demand for "the tillers have their land." At that time, the peasants' demand for land lay in "tilling" and not in "having." He said that some people, on the one hand, acknowledged that Cao Cao's measures conformed to the demands of the people, and on the other hand, said that they violated the purpose of the Yellow Turban uprising. Why did things that conformed to the interests of the people violate the purpose of the Yellow Turbans? The purpose of the Yellow Turbans was consistent with the demands of the people. Since it is said that it conformed to the demands of the people, it is not good to say that it violated the purpose of the Yellow Turbans. When we say that Cao Cao did not violate the purpose of the Yellow Turban uprising, we are referring to its main aspects, not to all its aspects. Cao Cao's attack on the Yellow Turbans itself, of course, violated the purpose of the Yellow Turbans, which is self-evident. When we say that Cao Cao did not violate the purpose of the Yellow Turbans, we are referring to its objective effect, not saying that Cao Cao struggled to realize the purpose of the Yellow Turban uprising, nor that Cao Cao was the leader of the peasant uprising. Zhou Liangxiao believes that, due to historical limitations, the early peasant uprisings in feudal society did not have clear demands, but we analyze peasant uprisings precisely to start from their instinctive class demands. In fact, the objective effects shown by these uprisings were also obvious and thoroughly struck at the feudal system. Zhou Yiliang said that, after defeating the Yellow Turbans, Cao Cao did "organize" the Yellow Turbans as Guo Moruo said, but this should not be affirmed and said that although he suppressed the Yellow Turbans, he did not violate the purpose of the Yellow Turban uprising. He said: "I agree with Comrade Yang Bing's opinion. If we say that Cao Cao 'organized' the Yellow Turbans, then we must ask, who did the 'organization' serve after it was organized? But I think that, from the point of view of evaluating Cao Cao as a ruling class figure, suppressing the Yellow Turbans cannot be considered the mainstream in his decades of political activity." At the same time, he also disagreed with Yang Bing's view that Cao Cao's life activities were all summarized as war, and that all his policies and measures served the war. Zhi Shuishan believes that the purpose of the peasant uprising was to develop production, and the purpose of the emerging feudal rulers was to establish their own dynasty. The starting points of the two were opposite. However, the latter learned historical lessons and had to make certain concessions to the peasants and restore some production, which was only a means. At this time, restoring production had become a necessary condition for establishing and consolidating a new dynasty, and it should not be regarded as a continuation of the peasant war. However, it was promoted by the peasant war. It was the peasants who were kind to the emerging rulers, and the emerging rulers only did some good things and played a progressive role under the pressure of the peasants.

　　How to Estimate Cao Cao's Tuntian Policy

Tan Qixiang believes that Cao Cao's suppression of the powerful clans and the establishment of tuntian were indeed beneficial to the people. However, the so-called tuntian system was actually a military means to forcibly bind the military and civilians to the land for a high degree of exploitation, with the government taking 60% and the people taking 40%, or a 50/50 split, which led the military and civilians to become serfs. Therefore, "the people were unhappy and many fled," and "the soldiers in the army" also fled from time to time because they were not subjected to slavery. Cao Cao established severe punishments to prevent escape. This was Cao Cao's attitude towards the people. Therefore, after he unified the Yellow River Basin, peasant uprisings broke out continuously within a few years. Of course, in Cao Cao's era, because he suppressed the powerful clans and prohibited the extra "exploitation" of local officials, the lives of the peasants should have been better than since the time of Emperor Huan and Emperor Ling of the Eastern Han Dynasty, but the improvement was very limited. Shi Yi believes that the founding monarchs always made certain concessions to the peasants to varying degrees. Liu Bang, Liu Xiu, Li Shimin, and Zhu Yuanzhang all did this. Cao Cao's role in this regard was not particularly great. Taking tuntian as an example, the tuntian peasants were actually a kind of serf. In the case of serious damage to production at that time, this was an effective method, but as soon as the situation changed slightly, the backwardness of this system was exposed. By the early Jin Dynasty, it had become an obstacle to the development of production, and it had to be abolished and the tenancy system restored. Luo Yaojiu believes that the fleeing tuntian households were the Yellow Turban masses who were forcibly tunned after being defeated by Cao Cao. They resisted Cao Cao's exploitation by fleeing. Guo Moruo said that the tuntian policy was supported by the Yellow Turban peasants, which is questionable. Fang Ming, Tan Qixiang and others also held the same view. Liu Chunfan, Liu Donghai, Shang Yue, Rong Sheng, Zheng Tianting and others all believed that Cao Cao's tuntian, although the exploitation could not be said to be insignificant, was a progressive measure under the historical conditions at that time. It was even lighter than in the early Han Dynasty and the Western Jin Dynasty. For example, Rong Sheng said that Cao Cao's feudal exploitation was somewhat more lenient compared with the Han and Jin dynasties. As the political representative of the landlord class, Cao Cao was able to relatively reduce the burden on the peasants and give the people a chance to breathe, which was a great achievement in history. It is unfair to say that this was one of Cao Cao's great crimes. Liu Donghai said that, according to historical records, after the implementation of tuntian, "more than 100,000 families in Guanzhong flowed into Jingzhou, and when they heard that their homeland was peaceful, they all looked forward to returning home." It can be seen that the peasants welcomed this measure. The implementation of tuntian was also beneficial to the government. "Conquering in all directions, without the labor of transporting grain, he then destroyed the bandits and pacified the world." After the tuntian, the tragic scene of "people eating each other, white bones piled up, and the remaining flesh stinking on the road" had changed to the prosperous scene of "agricultural officials and soldiers farming, the sounds of chickens and dogs, and fields connecting to each other." The severely damaged Yellow River Basin was restored and developed, laying a material foundation for the Sima clan to unify China. This cannot but be said to be Cao Cao's contribution. Shang Yue said that the production relations of the tuntian system were basically suitable for the nature of the productive forces that developed from the Han Dynasty.

　　Can Cao Cao be Called a National Hero

Some people believe that it is inappropriate to call Cao Cao a national hero. The reasons are: Cao Cao suppressed the Yellow Turban uprising; he killed many people and was cruel throughout his life; the historical era in which he lived was not an era in which national contradictions were the main contradictions; the Wuhuan were not the most important enemies at that time, and Cao Cao's pacification of the Wuhuan was not a major achievement; his subjective motivation for pacifying the Wuhuan was not to save the Han people, but to consolidate his rule. Qiu Kezhen said, I disagree with saying that Cao Cao was a national hero, because Cao Cao killed many people and was cruel; the Wuhuan were relatively docile foreign tribes at that time, not as ferocious as the Xiongnu. Zhi Shuishan said that the Three Kingdoms was an era of peasant wars and civil wars, not an era of national wars. Cao Cao's military activities throughout his life were mainly civil wars, and foreign wars were only one or two episodes. It is far-fetched to call him a national hero. Some people believe that it is appropriate to call Cao Cao a national hero. The reasons are: Cao Cao made outstanding contributions to the economy, politics, and culture at that time. He unified the north, restored the economy of northern China, and laid a material foundation for the unification of the country, which conformed to the laws of social development and the demands of the broad masses of the people; especially in the just war against the Wuhuan invasion, he pacified the powerful foreign enemy, and rescued the Han people who were taken away and the Wuhuan people who were enslaved by the Wuhuan slave owners. Therefore, Cao Cao's conquest of the Wuhuan was beneficial to both the Han and Wuhuan people, and Cao Cao's contribution to national development was great.

　　How Should Historical Figures be Evaluated

The discussion also naturally touched on the question of how to evaluate historical figures. Liu Fengzhu and others believe that Yang Bing's standard for evaluating historical figures is: all feudal rulers are reactionaries. Therefore, his evaluation of Cao Cao is basically incorrect. Shu Shi agrees with the principle put forward by Guo Moruo, that is: to evaluate a historical figure, one should look at the problem comprehensively, weigh the importance of his major achievements, and especially see whether he made contributions to the people at that time, and whether he made contributions to the development of the entire nation and culture. It is necessary to comprehensively analyze him against the background of the historical era in which he lived, and based on the role he played in the development of history. He added that evaluating historical figures requires delving into historical reality and conducting class analysis in order to clarify the role he played in history. Shang Yue believes that historical figures can only create history when they correctly understand the existing conditions they encounter, when they understand how to change these conditions and use and master the laws of these conditions. Therefore, when discussing Cao Cao, we should first study what the existing conditions Cao Cao encountered were, and how he understood and changed these conditions, and mastered and used the laws of these conditions. Then we can judge whether his main political policies were meritorious or faulty, that is, what role did they play in the social development at that time. Chen Shoushi, whose overall view and Tan Qixiang are consistent, believes that evaluating historical figures is not a question of looking at a certain person, but a question of looking at the sum of the entire social relations of the historical period in which the historical figure lived. Therefore, one cannot evaluate historical figures by detaching them from the social stage in which they lived; otherwise, one will commit subjective and one-sided mistakes. He believes that there are three kinds of people in history, one is "The king is wise and bright, and I deserve to be punished," the other is "Heavenly changes are not to be feared, ancestors are not to be followed, and human words are not to be believed," and the third is "I hate the inequality between rich and poor, and now I will equalize it for you." For these three kinds of people, we should distinguish which is reactionary, which is progressive, and which is revolutionary, so as to decide how to evaluate them and whether to rehabilitate them. Xu Liqun believes that the main thing in evaluating a historical figure is to see whether he promoted the development of history; we cannot treat historical figures with our current demands. Our view of history is: to restore history to its original appearance. What should be rehabilitated must be rehabilitated, and what should not be rehabilitated cannot be rehabilitated, and it will not stand if it is rehabilitated. Rehabilitation must be based on facts. It is the scientific attitude of Marxism.

### 关于曹操问题讨论中的争论

　　关于曹操问题讨论中的争论
    自3月23日本报发表了郭沫若的“替曹操翻案”之后，关于如何评价曹操的问题，引起了更为普遍和深入的讨论。在这段时间中，除光明日报继续进行了这个讨论外，上海文汇报、广州羊城晚报也参加了这个讨论，上海解放日报、山东大众日报、天津日报等也都发表了探讨的文章，上海复旦大学、华东师范大学、华南师范学院、安徽省哲学社会科学学会、江苏师范学院、天津师范大学、北京大学等院校和科学研究单位还召开了讨论会，展开了热烈的争论。从3月下旬到5月上旬，在报刊上发表的文章和报道，约有六十余篇。在讨论中，大家对于曹操在我国历史上的功绩，曹操应该是一个正面人物，应该为曹操翻案，一般没有争论。至于这个案翻到什么程度，对曹操的某些行为和措施的评价、对某些史料的解释，却有许多不同的意见。争论的主要问题有：（一）黄巾农民起义的目的问题；（二）曹操的屯田政策问题；（三）曹操是不是民族英雄的问题；（四）如何评价历史人物的问题。
    曹操打了黄巾，是否没有违背黄巾起义的目的
    这个问题，已为目前争论的焦点。很多人对郭沫若提出的“曹操虽然打了黄巾，但没有违背黄巾起义的目的”，“把黄巾进行了组织化”的主张，表示不能同意。例如，罗耀九认为“农民起义的目的是希望有属于自己的一小块土地”，而曹操并没有满足其这个要求，而“把被迫投降的黄巾军改编一部分作为他的部属即所谓青州兵，而将大多数农民起义队伍解除武装，重新拿起耕具成为他的农奴。这就是屯田户。”谭其骧认为“农民的基本要求是土地，是耕者有其田，是轻徭薄赋，但曹操的措施是把农民编置在国有土地之上，在农官直接控制下进行农奴式的生产”怎么能说没有违背黄巾起义的目的？按照郭沫若的说法，“好像大官僚大地主出身的曹操竟代替黄巾军做到了他们自己未能达到的目的，竟成了农民军的领袖，农民阶级的代表人物。”式毅认为，“以后曹操所采取的许多向农民让步的措施，实际上是‘党人’的政治主张的贯彻和发展。如果说，曹操继承了汉末社会改良派的传统，是比较正确的。但黄巾起义军，则具有完全不同的性质。”从当时社会发展情况，黄巾活动以及张鲁政权在汉中措施的某些记载来看，农民要求的还是土地，并从空想社会主义观点出发，要求一个人人有饭吃的社会。曹操在反对豪强的斗争中，在一定时期一定程度上，同农民确处于同盟军的地位，但曹操所代表的政治势力，不是革命派，起义的黄巾则是彻底的革命派，因此，曹操根本无法继承作为地主阶级的敌人的黄巾的革命传统。有些人则反对这种说法，例如，戎笙认为，黄巾起义是中国封建社会早期的农民运动，社会革命还没有提到日程上来，“耕者有其田”只有在一定历史条件下才有可能提出来，在一千多年以前的农民起义，是不可能提出这样的要求的。农民要求土地，并不等于要求“耕者有其田”。当时农民对土地的要求在于“耕”而不在于“有”。他说，有些人一方面承认曹操的措施符合了人民的要求，一方面又说它违背了黄巾起义的目的。为什么符合了人民利益的事，却违背了黄巾的目的？黄巾的目的和人民的要求是一致的，既然说符合了人民的要求，也就不好说违背了黄巾的目的。我们说曹操没有违背黄巾起义的目的，是就其主要方面来说的，而不是说他的一切方面。曹操攻打黄巾这件事的本身，当然违背了黄巾的目的，这是不言而喻的。我们说曹操没有违背黄巾的目的，是就其客观作用来说的，并不是说，曹操为实现黄巾起义的目的而奋斗，也不是说曹操就是农民起义的领袖。周良霄则认为，封建社会早期的农民起义由于历史的局限，没有明确的要求，但我们分析农民起义正是要由它本能的阶级要求出发，事实上这些起义所表明的客观效果，也都是明显的、彻底的打击了封建制度的。周一良说，打败黄巾后，确是如郭沫若所说，曹操把黄巾“组织化”了，但是决不能因此而加以肯定，说他虽镇压黄巾而没有违背黄巾起义的目的。他说：“我同意杨柄同志的意见，如果说曹操把黄巾‘组织化’了，那就得问，‘组织化’以后为谁服务？但是我认为，从评价曹操这样一个统治阶级人物看来，镇压黄巾在他一生几十年政治活动中，还不能算主流”。同时他也不同意杨柄把曹操一生活动都概括为战争、他的一切政策和措施全都服务于战争的观点。支水山认为，农民起义的目的是要发展生产，新兴的封建统治者的目的是要建立自己的王朝，二者的出发点是对立的。但后者接受历史教训，不得不对农民作某些让步，恢复一些生产，只不过是手段。恢复生产在这时已成为建立和巩固新王朝的必要条件，而决不能把它当成是农民战争的继续，不过，它却是农民战争促成的。是农民有恩德于新兴统治者，新兴统治者只是在农民逼迫下，做了点好事，起了进步作用。
    如何估计曹操的屯田政策
    谭其骧认为，曹操摧抑豪强兴办屯田诚然对人民有利，但所谓屯田制，实际上是一种军事手段强制束缚军民在土地上进行官六私四或对半分的高度剥削，使军和民都走上了农奴化的道路。所以“民不乐，多逃亡”，“在军之士”，因为不受奴役，也时有逃亡。曹操为防止逃亡，立了重刑。这就是曹操对待人民的态度，所以在他统一了黄河流域后不多几年内，就不断爆发了多次农民起义。当然，在曹操时代由于他锄抑了豪强，禁断了地方长吏的额外“兴发”，农民的生活应该要比东汉桓灵以来好一些，但也好得极有限。式毅认为，开国君主总要在不同程度上对农民作某些让步，刘邦、刘秀、李世民、朱元璋等人都是这样做的。曹操在这方面起的作用并不特别大。以屯田而论，屯田农民，实际上是一种农奴。这在当时生产严重破坏的情况下，不失为一个行之有效的办法，但情况稍一转变，就暴露了这种制度的落后性，以至到了晋初，它已成为发展生产的障碍，而不得不废除而仍恢复租佃制。罗耀九认为，逃亡的屯田户即被曹操击败后强制屯田的黄巾群众，他们以逃亡的方式来反抗曹操的剥削，郭沫若说，屯田政策得到黄巾农民的支持，是值得商榷的。方明、谭其骧等人，也有同样看法。柳春藩、刘东海、尚钺、戎笙、郑天挺等人，则都认为曹操的屯田，剥削不能说不重，但在当时的历史条件下，这是一种进步的措施。而且比之汉初和西晋来甚至还算是轻的。例如戎笙说，曹操时的封建剥削与汉晋两代相比，总算是宽了一些。作为地主阶级政治代表的曹操，能够相对地减轻农民的负担，给人民以喘息的机会，总算是历史上的一大功绩，说这是曹操的大罪之一，是不公允的。刘东海说，史载，实行屯田后，“关中百姓，流入荆州者十余万家，及闻本土安宁，皆企望思归”，可见这项措施，农民是欢迎的。实行屯田对政府也是有利的，“征伐四方，无运粮之劳，遂兼灭群贼，克平天下”，经过屯田到曹芳时，“人相食啖、白骨盈积，残骸余肉，臭秽道路”的惨景，已变为“农官兵田，鸡犬之声，阡陌相属”的昌盛景象，遭到严重破坏的黄河流域，又恢复发展起来，给司马氏统一中国，奠定了物质基础，这不能不说是曹操的功劳。尚钺说，屯田制的生产关系基本上适合于从两汉发展起来的生产力的性质。
    曹操能不能被称为民族英雄
    有些人认为，把曹操称为民族英雄是不适当的。理由是：曹操镇压过黄巾起义，在他一生中杀人多而又残酷；他所处的历史年代不是民族矛盾为主要矛盾的时代；乌桓不是当时头等重要的敌人，曹操平定乌桓的作用不算大，他的平定乌桓主观动机不是为了解救汉族人民，而是为了巩固他的统治。丘可贞说，我不同意说曹操是民族英雄，因为曹操杀人很多而且残酷；乌桓在当时是比较驯服的外族，不如匈奴那么凶恶。支水山说，三国是农民战争和内战的时代，而不是民族战争时代。曹操一生的军事活动，主要也是打内战，对外战争只不过是一二个插曲，把他叫做民族英雄是勉强的。有些人则认为称曹操为民族英雄是恰如其分的，所持理由是：曹操对当时经济、政治、文化都有杰出的贡献。他统一了北方，恢复北中国的经济，并为统一全国奠定了物质基础，是符合社会发展规律和广大人民要求的；特别是他在反抗乌桓入侵的正义战争中，平定了强大的外敌，解救了被夺去的汉族人民和在乌桓奴隶主奴役下的乌桓人民，因此，曹操征乌桓对汉族和乌桓人民都有利，曹操对民族发展的贡献是很大的。
    应该如何评价历史人物
    在讨论中也自然地涉及到了如何评价历史人物的问题。刘凤翥等认为，杨柄评定历史人物的标准是：凡是封建统治者都是反动派。因此他对曹操的评价基本上是不正确的。束世?同意郭沫若提出的原则，即：评价一个历史人物，应该从全面来看问题，从其大节上来权其轻重，特别要看他对于当时的人民有无贡献，对于整个的民族发展、文化发展有无贡献。应该以他所处的历史时代为背景，从他对历史发展所起的作用为标准，来加以全面分析。他并补充说，评论人物需要深入历史实际，进行阶级分析，才能明确他在历史上所起的作用。尚钺认为，历史人物只有在他们正确了解他们所碰到的现成条件的时候，只有在他们了解如何改变这些条件并利用和掌握这些条件的规律的时候，他们才能创造历史。因此，在讨论曹操时，首先应该研究曹操所碰到的现成条件是什么，以及他如何了解和改变这些条件，掌握和利用这些条件的规律，然后才能判断他的主要政治政策是功还是过，亦即对当时社会发展，起的是什么作用。对曹操的评价的总的看法和谭其骧一致的陈守实认为，评价历史人物，不是对某一个人的看法问题，而是对这个历史人物所处历史时期的整个社会关系总和的看法。因此不能脱离历史人物所处的社会阶段来评价历史人物；否则就会犯主观、片面的错误。他认为历史上有三种人，一是“天王圣明，臣罪当诛”，一是“天变不足畏，祖宗不足法，人言不足信”；一是“吾疾贫富不均，今为汝均之”。对于这三种人，应该分清何者反动，何者进步，何者革命，从而决定如何给他评价，该不该给他翻案。许立群认为，评价一个历史人物主要看他是不是促进了历史的发展；不能以我们今天的要求来对待历史人物。我们的历史观就是：还历史以本来的面貌。该翻的一定要翻，不该翻的就不能翻，翻了也站不住脚。翻，要以事实做根据。是马克思主义的科学态度。
