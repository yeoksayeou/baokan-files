Leadership Concentrated, Labor Concentrated, Thought Concentrated, Tasks Concentrated, Time Concentrated
    Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 26th: ZaoYang County in Hubei Province has completed the rush harvesting of 1.1 million mu of wheat. While harvesting wheat, the people of the county have launched a new high tide of simultaneously transplanting rice seedlings, sowing coarse grains, and strengthening cotton field management.

    ZaoYang County is located in northern Hubei Province and is rich in wheat. This year, thanks to the implementation of the "Eight-Character Charter" for agricultural production increase, the wheat is better than in previous years. In order to harvest the bumper wheat crop, all parts of the county concentrated leadership, labor, thought, tasks, and time, striving for a great victory in wheat harvesting. Many places have also stipulated detailed harvesting systems such as harvesting well, threshing well, managing well, not losing ears, and not dropping grains. At the same time, from the county to the production teams, wheat harvesting headquarters were established, and within the production teams, shock brigades and combat groups were generally established; many places also set up battle sheds on the fields. Furthermore, according to the different regions and the order of wheat ripening, production teams and small teams organized mutually beneficial labor cooperation at equivalent value, achieving reaping one piece and planting one piece. In this way, the county's 320,000-strong harvesting army took only five days to harvest more than one million mu of wheat.

    During the wheat harvest, ZaoYang County rationally arranged labor, grasped the two key points of "seizing grain in the narrow gap between harvests" and "summer planting at the right time" from the beginning, planting early and planting well, thereby laying a solid foundation for the autumn harvest. According to incomplete statistics, while rushing to harvest wheat, the county transplanted more than 30,000 mu of rice seedlings and sowed more than 50,000 mu of coarse grains. Donggang Management District of Liangji Commune implemented a continuous operation method, achieving simultaneous harvesting, transporting, sending fertilizer, preparing fields, and transplanting rice seedlings. The commune members happily sang: "Catching the moon, chasing the stars, yellow in the morning, green in the afternoon, only because we are strong in work, the wheat field changes two ways in a day."

    In order to strive for a greater autumn harvest, the county's leading organs are leading the communes to summarize the experience of large-scale high-yield summer crops, and continue to implement the five concentrations of leadership, labor, thought, tasks, and time, as well as the leadership method of grasping both ends and leading the middle, properly arranging labor, implementing small-section contracting, doing a good job in labor quotas, implementing reward and punishment systems, and carrying out red flag competitions and high work efficiency movements; at the same time, they are ensuring plowing and planting with harvesting, ensuring area, ensuring planning, and ensuring total output. The county's rice transplanting and sowing work is progressing rapidly and is expected to be completed in early June.

    Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 26th: Yangzhou and Yancheng Special Zones in northern Jiangsu are seizing the golden season for planting and actively expanding the planting area.

    Under the leadership of party committees at all levels, cadres and masses in Yangzhou Special Zone, based on the principle of both achieving high-yield production and planting more for more harvests, after on-site surveys and on-site planning, formulated plans to expand the planting area in early and mid-May. At present, the entire zone has planted more than 500,000 mu of idle fields and gaps, more than 20 million ponds of various melons, and interplanted more than 200,000 mu of soybeans and miscellaneous beans in early autumn crops. The people of this special zone also plan to replant arrowhead in paddy fields and replant tall-stalk crops such as corn and sorghum in dry grain fields after the early autumn crops are harvested. Xinghua, Gaoyou, Baoying, and other counties in the water network area habitually leave some leisure land every year because of more land and fewer people. This year, it was decided to plant all leisure land with crops. According to these plans, the total planting area of the entire special zone this year will increase from the original plan of more than 16.5 million mu to more than 18 million mu (excluding some intercropping crops), an increase of 8.7%.

    Yancheng Special Zone plans to expand the summer planting area from the original 9.82 million mu to 11 million mu. In expanding the planting area, each county can proceed from the actual local situation and implement the principle of "focusing on development and planting according to local conditions." Yancheng County plans to plant arrowhead and water chestnuts in summer in rice fields, and radishes in summer in some early-planted cotton fields, and the county can expand the planting area by 200,000 mu. Binhai County intends to interplant 120,000 mu of spring beans, autumn beans, and sweet potatoes in corn fields; and replant 200,000 mu of carrots, buckwheat, and miscellaneous beans in late stubble fields. In addition, each person will use vacant land to plant one-tenth of a mu of vegetables, and the county can expand the planting area by more than 400,000 mu this year. Yancheng Special Zone also used gaps to organize 650,000 laborers to rush to accumulate summer fertilizer to prepare base fertilizer for expanding the planting area. As of the 15th of this month, the entire zone has expanded planting of more than 300,000 mu of various melons, vegetables, and other crops.

    枣阳边收边种  麦田早晚两样
    扬州盐城抓紧黄金季节利用空闲地播种杂粮
    本报武汉26日电  湖北省枣阳县一百一十万亩小麦已经抢收完毕，在麦收的同时，全县人民掀起了插秧、播种杂粮、加强棉田管理等齐头并进的新高潮。
    枣阳县位于湖北省北部，盛产小麦，今年由于贯彻了农业增产“八字宪法”，小麦比往年更好。为了把丰收小麦抢收到手，全县各地做到了领导集中、劳力集中、思想集中、活路集中、时间集中，力争麦收大胜。许多地方还规定了收好、打好、管好、割不丢穗、打不掉粒等细收细打制度。同时，从县到生产队都成立了麦收四快指挥部，在生产小队内，普遍建立了突击队、战斗组；不少地方还在地头上搭起了战棚。并且根据地区不同和小麦黄熟先后的差异，生产队与生产队之间、小队与小队之间，组织了等价互利的劳力大协作，做到了黄一块割一块，割一块种一块。这样一来，全县三十二万抢收大军，仅用了五天时间就把一百多万亩小麦收到手了。
    在麦收中，枣阳县合理安排了劳动力，一开始就抓住了“龙口夺粮”和“夏种一时”两个关键，种早种好，从而为秋季丰收打下了坚实的基础。据不完全统计，全县在与抢收小麦的同时，共插秧三万多亩，播种杂粮五万多亩。梁集公社董岗管理区实行了连环操作方法，做到了随收、随运、随送肥、随整田、随插秧。社员们都是这样高兴地唱着：“赶月亮，追星星，上午黄，下午青，只因我们干劲强，麦田一天两个样。”
    为了力争秋季更大丰收，这个县的领导机关正领导各公社总结夏季作物大面积丰产的经验，并且继续贯彻领导、劳力、思想、活路、时间等五大集中和抓两头带中间的领导方法，妥善安排劳动力，实行小段包工，搞好劳动定额，执行奖惩制度，开展红旗竞赛和高工效运动；同时做到随收随犁，随种随插，保面积，保规划，保总产。全县的插秧和播种工作进展很快，预计在6月上旬即可结束。
    新华社南京26日电  江苏北部扬州、盐城两个专区抓紧播种的黄金季节，积极扩大播种面积。
    扬州专区的干部和群众在各级党委领导下，根据既要搞高额丰产，又要多种多收的原则，经过实地勘察和现场排队，在5月上、中旬分别制定了扩大播种面积的规划。现在，全区已经种的闲田隙地达五十多万亩，各种瓜类二千多万塘，在春播的早秋作物中间种了大豆、杂豆二十多万亩。这个专区的人民还打算早秋作物收获以后，在水田里复种慈菇，旱谷田里复种玉米、高粱等高秆作物。水网地区的兴化、高邮、宝应等县，因为地多人少，习惯上每年都要留一些休闲地。今年决定把全部休闲地种上庄稼。按照这些规划，全专区今年的播种面积，由原计划的一千六百五十多万亩增加到一千八百多万亩（不包括一部分间种作物），增加播种面积8.7％。
    盐城专区计划把夏种面积由原来的九百八十二万亩扩大到一千一百万亩。各县在扩大播种面积中，能够从本地实际情况出发，实行“重点发展，因地种植”的原则。盐城县计划在水稻田中夏种慈菇、荸荠，在一部分早种的棉田里夏种萝卜，全县就可扩大播种面积二十万亩。滨海县打算在玉米田内间作春豆、秋豆、山芋十二万亩；晚茬田再套种胡萝卜、荞麦、杂豆等二十万亩。加上每人利用空地种上一分田蔬菜，全县今年可以扩大播种面积四十多万亩。盐城专区还利用空隙，组织了六十五万个劳动力突击积夏作肥，为扩大种植面积准备基肥。到本月15日为止，全区已扩种了各种瓜、菜等作物三十多万亩。
