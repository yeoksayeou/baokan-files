Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 22nd Dispatch: Our correspondent reports: For the eight years since the peaceful liberation of Tibet, the Central People's Government and the People's Liberation Army troops stationed in Tibet have faithfully implemented the Seventeen-Article Agreement on the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet and have done many good things for the Tibetan people. However, anything that benefits the broad masses of the Tibetan people has been obstructed and undermined by the former Tibetan local government and the upper-class reactionary group.

Under the dark rule of the former Tibetan local government, Tibetan society in the past stagnated for a long time, and its economy and culture were very backward. The people suffered from hunger and disease for a long time. The former Tibetan local government, which represented the interests of the great serf owners, only knew how to exploit and oppress the people and never did anything good for them. Moreover, in order to maintain the dark serf system, they did everything possible to obstruct the Central People's Government and the People's Liberation Army troops stationed in Tibet from doing good things for the Tibetan people.

The Central People's Government sent work teams to rural areas, pastoral areas, and handicraft industry areas every year to distribute interest-free grain loans and loans to help the people develop production. The former Tibetan local government, fearing that its usury would have no way out, threatened the people, saying, "If you borrow grain and money from the Han people, your whole family will have to work hard for the Han people for the rest of your lives." In some places, the Zong government even openly issued orders prohibiting borrowing from the work teams. In March 1955, the State Council, at the request of the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Erdeni, allocated one million yuan to purchase a large number of new-style agricultural and pastoral tools, ready to be distributed to Tibetan farmers and herdsmen free of charge. However, the former Tibetan local government fabricated the lie that "Tibetan farmers and herdsmen are unwilling to use new tools." As a result, except for the 57,000 pieces of agricultural and pastoral tools distributed in the Qamdo area, tens of thousands of new-style tools had to be stockpiled in warehouses in the area under the jurisdiction of the former Tibetan local government, and the vast majority of farmers and herdsmen still struggled to farm with wooden plows and stone tools.

In order to accelerate the construction of the Tibetan region and change the backward transportation situation in Tibet, the Central People's Government has built more than 7,000 kilometers of highways and motor vehicle lanes in Tibet in the past eight years. The vast majority of Tibetan people call the highway the "golden bridge to a happy paradise." However, the former Tibetan local government hated the construction of highways to the bone. During the survey and construction of the highway, they either used the excuse that it would touch "sacred mountains," infringe upon "spirits," and destroy "feng shui," or they used the excuse that "the people oppose it" and "the temples oppose it" to obstruct the construction, or they simply prohibited the masses from participating in the road construction. The State Council's decision on transportation issues in Tibet in 1955 stipulated that the Heihe to Lhasa section of the Qinghai-Tibet Highway should be renovated and rerouted due to poor road conditions that affected transportation. However, due to the obstruction of the former Tibetan local government, the renovation and rerouting project of the 90-kilometer section from Yangbajing to Lhasa was delayed for three full years and had not been completed until before the rebellion. In July of last year, the Qinghai-Tibet Highway Bureau repeatedly negotiated with the former Tibetan local government, but was flatly rejected by Galun Xianka・Jumei Dorje (i.e., Xia Su), who was in charge of handling the matter. Subsequently, the central government proposed that the use of land belonging to the Tibetan government and landlords in the rerouting could be compensated for at a price, and it was guaranteed that it would not affect the irrigation and cultivation of farmland on both sides of the highway. The former Tibetan local government was at a loss for words and finally claimed to send officials to assist in the handling, but in reality, the officials sent out incited reactionary headmen in villages on both sides of the highway to come out in opposition. More than 20 reactionary headmen, calling themselves "representatives of the masses," petitioned the central government, expressing their refusal. They also threatened our staff, saying, "Whoever moves an inch of my land will have to fight to the death!"

The Tibetan people have long relied on cow dung and firewood as fuel, which is not only expensive but also difficult to supply. To this end, the Central People's Government specially sent a coalfield exploration team to find coal mines for the Tibetan people to solve the fuel problem. However, the former Tibetan local government and the upper-class reactionary group spread rumors, saying, "The Han people are here to steal our treasures," and ordered the people everywhere not to lead the way for the exploration team. In early 1958, Aliya, an old herdsman from the Anduo horse-buying tribe in northern Tibet, reported a coal mine to the exploration team. As a result, he was tied up and beaten by local officials and headmen, and then his eyes were gouged out with a red-hot copper wire. They also threatened the people, saying, "Whoever works for the Communist Party again will suffer the same fate as Aliya."

In 1956, the central government decided to build a new-style hydroelectric power plant on a barren mountain in the northeastern suburbs of Lhasa. The former Tibetan local government spread rumors everywhere, saying that there were "spirits" in that mountain and that building a power plant would scare them away. Later, they spread lies that "the local people oppose it," and so on. After these lies were exposed, the former Tibetan local government formally proposed to the central government to "compensate" the serf owners for the so-called "losses" brought about by the construction of the power plant. Not only did they want "compensation" for the "loss" of land and rocks, but even if the rocks rolling down from the mountain crushed a few small trees at the foot of the mountain belonging to the serf owners, the central government had to "compensate" with silver dollars. During the construction process, Sokang Wangqing Gele, a Galun of the former Tibetan local government and one of the rebel leaders, pretended to be "active" on the surface, "guaranteeing" to mobilize 1,500 laborers to participate in the construction project, but secretly obstructed the masses from participating in every possible way. As a result, not a single laborer was "mobilized" by him and the Tibetan government.

In 1957, the Central People's Government decided to allocate funds to build a batch of houses in Lhasa for the poor, beggars, and vagrants, so that many people living on the streets could end their lives of being exposed to the wind and rain. The former Tibetan local government found all kinds of excuses to obstruct such a thing that was specially beneficial to the poor. They said that they could not find "suitable land" for a while, and that they could not gather laborers for a while. After a long time, they simply stopped mentioning it. Until the eve of the rebellion, more than a year had passed, and these houses could not be started.

For thousands of years, there has not been a single school in the Tibetan region, and the vast working people have had no opportunity to learn culture for generations. After the peaceful liberation of Tibet, the Central People's Government decided to open schools in various places. However, the former Tibetan local government opposed even such things. Later, under the pressure of the broad masses of the people, the former Tibetan local government had to agree to open schools, but they also prevented parents from sending their children to school. Lhasa Primary School had been open for a long time, but children of farmers in the suburbs still could not go to school. In the Ali Plateau, which covers an area of 400,000 square kilometers, not a single literate person could be found among the working people for hundreds of years. In 1956, the Ali Sub-Committee of the CPC opened the first primary school, which was warmly welcomed by farmers and herdsmen. However, less than half a year after it was opened, local officials and headmen used "labor shortage" as an excuse to prohibit children from going to school. If they did not listen, the parents would be "punished." The primary school was finally forced to close.

The former Tibetan local government also did everything possible to obstruct the Central People's Government from opening hospitals in Tibet. In 1956, the State Council, at the request of the Dalai Lama, allocated funds to build a new hospital building in Lhasa. The former Tibetan local government had previously agreed to build the building on a piece of land in the northern suburbs of Lhasa, but when the building was about to be completed, they suddenly proposed that the "owner" of this land wanted to take back the land for his own use. After consultations and negotiations, large and small meetings were held more than ten times. In the end, the Central People's Government still had to give the land "owner" hundreds of thousands of silver dollars as "compensation." The former Tibetan local government used the same method to obstruct the construction of the Tibet Military Region Hospital of the People's Liberation Army.

    原西藏地方政府维护黑暗农奴制
    百般阻挠中央为藏胞办好事
    不许藏胞接受无息农贷　阻挠中央修公路兴水利
    不让中央办医院盖房屋　禁止家长送子弟上学校
    新华社拉萨22日电　本社记者报道：西藏和平解放八年来，中央人民政府和人民解放军进藏部队忠实地执行和平解放西藏办法的十七条协议，为西藏人民办了许多好事；可是，只要是对西藏广大人民有益的事，原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团无不横加阻挠和破坏。
    在原西藏地方政府的黑暗统治下，过去的西藏社会长期停滞不前，经济和文化都非常落后，人民长期遭受饥饿和疾病的折磨和威胁。代表大农奴主利益的原西藏地方政府，只知道剥削和压榨人民，从来不为人民做一点好事。不但如此，他们为了维护黑暗的农奴制度，还百般阻挠中央人民政府和人民解放军进藏部队为西藏人民做好事。
    中央人民政府每年都派工作队到农村、牧区和手工业地区发放无息贷粮和贷款，帮助人民发展生产。原西藏地方政府因为害怕自己的高利贷没有出路，便恐吓人民说：“借了汉人的粮和钱，全家都要为汉人做一辈子苦工。”有些地方的宗政府甚至公开下命令，不许向工作队借贷。1955年3月，国务院根据达赖喇嘛和班禅额尔德尼的请求，拨款一百万元购置了大批新式农牧工具，准备无偿地发给西藏农牧民。而原西藏地方政府却无中生有地说什么“西藏农牧民不愿用新工具”。结果，除在昌都地区发放了五万七千件农牧工具外，在原西藏地方政府所辖地区内，数万件新式工具不得不积压在仓库里，广大农牧民仍然艰难地靠木犁和石器耕作。
    为了加速西藏地区的建设，改变西藏交通闭塞状况，八年来，中央人民政府在西藏修筑了七千多公里公路和汽车便道，广大西藏人民把公路称作“通向幸福天堂的金桥”。但是，原西藏地方政府对公路建设也痛恨入骨。在公路测量和修筑中，他们或者借口会触动“圣山”、侵犯“神灵”、破坏“风水”，或者借口“老百姓反对”、“寺庙反对”等进行阻挠，或者干脆禁止群众参加修路。1955年国务院关于西藏交通运输问题的决定中规定，青藏公路黑河至拉萨段因路面较坏，影响运输，应进行整修和改线。但由于原西藏地方政府的阻挠，其中从羊八井到拉萨一段九十公里的整修和改线工程，整整拖了三年，直到叛乱发生前还未能完成。去年7月间，青藏公路局一再同原西藏地方政府协商，但都被负责处理这件事的噶伦先喀·居美多杰（即夏苏）一口回绝。随后，中央提出在改线中使用藏政府和领主的土地，可以作价补偿，并保证不影响公路两旁农田的灌溉和耕作。原西藏地方政府理屈词穷，最后美其名说派官员协助办理，而实际上，派出的官员却在公路两旁村庄煽动反动头人出来反对。曾有二十几个反动头人自称为“群众的代表”，向中央“请愿”表示拒绝。他们还威吓我工作人员说：“谁动我一寸土地，就要拚个你死我活！”
    西藏人民长期靠牛粪和木柴作燃料，不仅价格高，而且供应困难。为此，中央人民政府专门派了一支煤田勘查队为西藏人民寻找煤矿，以解决燃料问题。但原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团却造谣说：“汉人是来偷我们宝贝的”，并命令各地人民不许为勘查队带路。1958年初，西藏北部安多买马部落老牧民阿里雅向勘查队报告了一处煤矿，结果被当地官员和头人捆起来拷打，后来又用一根烧红的铜丝挖掉了阿里雅的双眼，并且威胁人们说：“谁再为共产党做事，阿里雅的下场就是他的下场。”
    1956年，中央确定在拉萨东北郊一座荒山里修建新型水力发电厂，原西藏地方政府却到处放空气说那座山里有“神灵”，修电厂就会把“神灵”吓走；以后又散布什么“当地群众反对”等等谎言。这些谎言破产以后，原西藏地方政府又正式向中央提出要“赔偿”修电厂给农奴主们带来的所谓“损失”。不仅要“赔偿”地皮、岩石的“损失”，甚至从山岩上滚下的石头把农奴主在山脚下的几棵小树压倒了，也要中央“赔偿”银元。在修建过程中，原西藏地方政府噶伦、叛匪首脑之一的索康·旺清格勒表面上假装“积极”，“保证”要动员一千五百名民工参加修建工程，而暗地里却百般阻挠群众参加，结果由他和藏政府“动员”的民工一名也没有。
    1957年，中央人民政府决定拨款在拉萨市为贫民、乞丐和流浪汉修盖一批房屋，让许多露宿街头的人们结束风吹雨打的生活。原西藏地方政府对这样专对贫苦人民有益的事，更是找出各种借口加以阻挠。他们一会说找不到“合适的地皮”，一会又说召集不到民工，久而久之，干脆再也不提这件事了。直到叛乱前夕为止，一年多过去了，这批房屋还无法动工。
    千百年来西藏地区没有一所学校，广大劳动人民世世代代没有机会学习文化。西藏和平解放后，中央人民政府决定在各地开办学校。可是，原西藏地方政府连这样的事情也加以反对。以后，在广大人民的压力下，原西藏地方政府不得不同意开办学校，但他们又阻拦家长送子弟上学。拉萨小学开学很久了，郊区农民的孩子仍然不能上学。在面积达四十万平方公里的阿里高原上，几百年来劳动人民中找不到一个识字的人。1956年中共阿里分工委开办了第一所小学，受到农牧民的热烈欢迎。但开办不到半年，当地官员和头人便以“劳动力缺乏”作为借口，禁止孩子们上学，如果不听，家长就要受到“惩罚”，小学终于被迫停办了。
    原西藏地方政府还百般阻挠中央人民政府在西藏开设医院。1956年，国务院根据达赖喇嘛的请求，拨款在拉萨修建新的医院大楼。原西藏地方政府事先同意把大楼盖在拉萨北郊的一片土地上，可是当大楼快要落成的时候，他们却又突然提出，这片土地的“主人”要收回土地自用。经过协商和交涉，大会小会开了十多次，最后中央人民政府仍然不得不给土地“主人”数十万元银元作为“赔偿”。原西藏地方政府并用同样的办法，阻挠人民解放军西藏军区医院的修建。
