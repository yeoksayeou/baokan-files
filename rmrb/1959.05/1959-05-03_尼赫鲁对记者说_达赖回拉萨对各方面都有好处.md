Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, May 2nd. According to a report from Kathmandu by the Indian Press Trust on May 1st, Prime Minister Nehru, while making a special visit to a group of Nepalese reporters on the banks of the Kosi River on the Indian-Nepalese border on April 30th, said that if the Dalai Lama "could really return to Lhasa," it would be beneficial to all relevant parties.

Prime Minister Nehru made these remarks while answering questions from reporters after holding talks with King Mahendra on the Indo-Nepalese border.

According to reports, Nehru said that the Chinese are asking the Dalai Lama to return to Tibet, and they believe his return would be beneficial. When a reporter asked Nehru whether he himself believed that the Dalai Lama's return to Tibet would help ease the situation, he said:
	"I cannot say anything about this matter."

In response to the question of whether it would be beneficial for the Dalai Lama to go to Nepal, Nehru said that the Dalai Lama has "absolute freedom" to go to any place he likes and live in any place he likes. He said that the Dalai Lama is a "free man" and can even return to Tibet. He added, "If he (the Dalai Lama) could really return to Tibet," it would certainly be beneficial to all relevant parties.

Nehru estimated that approximately five thousand Tibetan "refugees" had entered the Indian and Bhutanese borders, and then asked the Chairman of the Nepalese Council of Ministers, General Subarna Shamsher, about the number of Tibetan "refugees" who had entered Nepal. Shamsher replied: "Probably only a small number of refugees have come to Nepal, but it is difficult to distinguish refugees from other people."

It is said that Nehru also told reporters that India is prepared to re-examine the India-Nepal trade agreement.

According to the "Hindustan Times," Nehru may report to the Congress Working Committee on the recent developments in Tibet and also briefly talk about his meeting with the Dalai Lama in Mussoorie.

The Congress Working Committee, which will meet in New Delhi on May 8th and 9th, will discuss the so-called "Tibetan situation" and will also study India's relations with China based on the situation.

After this meeting, a three-day meeting of the All-India Congress Committee will be held at Sapru House starting from May 10th.

    尼赫鲁对记者说
    达赖回拉萨对各方面都有好处
    新华社新德里2日电　据印度报业托辣斯5月1日自加德满都报道，尼赫鲁总理4月30日在印度和尼泊尔边境的柯西河岸上特别接见一批尼泊尔记者时说，如果达赖喇嘛“真能回到拉萨”，那对一切有关方面都有好处。
    尼赫鲁总理是在印—尼边境同马亨德拉国王举行会谈以后回答记者们的问题时讲这番话的。
    据报道，尼赫鲁说，中国人要求达赖喇嘛回西藏去，他们认为他的回去是有好处的。当记者问尼赫鲁他本人是否认为达赖喇嘛回西藏去将有助于缓和局势时，他说：
  “我不能对这件事说什么话。”
    尼赫鲁在答复达赖喇嘛到尼泊尔去是否会有好处的问题时说，达赖喇嘛有到他所喜欢的任何地方去并且住在任何他所喜欢的地方的
  “绝对自由”。他说，达赖喇嘛是一个“自由人”，甚至可以回西藏去。他又说，“如果他（达赖喇嘛）真能回西藏”，这当然对一切有关方面都有好处。
    尼赫鲁估计，大约有五千名西藏“难民”已进入印度和不丹边境，他然后问尼泊尔大臣会议主席苏巴纳·沙姆谢尔将军关于已经进入尼泊尔的西藏“难民”的人数。沙姆谢尔回答说：“大概只有一小批难民到尼泊尔来，但是难民同其他人是很难区分的。”
    据说，尼赫鲁还对记者说，印度准备重新审查印度—尼泊尔贸易协定。
    据“印度斯坦时报”报道，尼赫鲁可能向国大党工作委员会汇报最近西藏的发展情况并且还简短地谈谈他在穆索里同达赖喇嘛的会见。
    5月8日和9日将在新德里开会的国大党工作委员会将讨论所谓“西藏局势”，并且还将根据局势来研究印度同中国的关系。
    这次会议以后，还将自5月10日起在萨普鲁大厅举行为期三天的印度国大党全国委员会会议。
