Comrade Chairman, Fellow Deputies, Fellow Committee Members:

I fully agree with the “Government Work Report” made by Premier Zhou, and the reports by Vice-Premiers Li Fuchun, Li Xiannian, and Vice-Chairman Peng Zhen.

Now I would like to share a few of my experiences regarding the great leap forward in the textile industry of Hebei Province since 1958:

**Large-Scale Technological Innovation and the Flourishing of the Textile Industry Everywhere**

Like all other work across the country, and like the textile industries of all fraternal regions across the country, 1958 was a year of great leap forward for our Hebei Province's textile industry. On the basis of a complete victory in the nationwide rectification campaign, inspired by the Party's general line for socialist construction, and driven by the emphasis on steel, the textile industry in our Hebei Province has seen an unprecedented leap forward in production, technology, capital construction, and all other areas of work.

In 1958, our province victoriously completed the annual cotton yarn production plan one and a half months ahead of schedule. In the past, textile industries, even if they exceeded production targets, did so by only a few percentage points, and further exceeding was considered impossible. However, in 1958, our annual cotton yarn production plan was completed by 121.35%, an increase of 58.52% compared to 1957. The production of cotton cloth, printed and dyed cloth, and fine woolen textiles also increased by 30% to 40% compared to 1957.

While production increased, the quality of products and the variety of designs also greatly improved. In 1958 alone, more than 600 new varieties and 1,800 new designs were successfully trial-produced. Many things that had not been done before, such as flocked floral fabrics and knitwear with electrostatic flocking, embossed fabrics, and shrink-resistant, wrinkle-resistant printed fabrics, were also put into production in 1958.

In terms of production technology, a great leap forward was also achieved through a large-scale technological revolution movement. In 1958, the high-speed operation of machinery was universally promoted throughout our province. The speed level, especially the speed level of spinning machines, was something that had never been seen or heard of before. This measure increased the unit output by an average of 20% to 30% without any investment, additional equipment, or manpower. During the technological revolution movement, more than 200,000 textile workers in the province proposed more than 300,000 innovation suggestions, of which more than 50,000 have been implemented or successfully tested. This massive mass-based technological revolution movement has greatly changed the technical work of our province's textile industry. It broke through the old process designs, broke through the old process procedures, and broke through the old production quotas, further realizing and opening up the path of shortening, continuousness, automation, and mechanization of the textile, printing and dyeing, and knitting processes, and providing useful data for new factory designs.

The capital construction work of our province's textile industry has also fully embodied the spirit of the leap forward since 1958. For example, the Baoding No. 1 Cotton Textile Factory adopted the method of simultaneous construction, installation, and production, overcoming various supply difficulties and breaking with conventions. Before the factory buildings were even completed, machines were installed in the warehouse and production began. This factory only started construction in May 1958, but by the eve of "August 1st" (Army Day), in just over two months, the first bundle of cotton yarn was produced. This speed was also unprecedented. In addition, after the rural communization, due to the implementation of the central government's policy of "the whole people running industry" and the combination of large, medium, and small enterprises, the textile industry in our province has also developed in the people's communes in various inland counties. At present, the civil engineering of the textile factory of Xushui County People's Commune has been basically completed and is about to begin installing equipment. An'guo and other counties are also actively carrying out the construction of textile factories. This marks that since the great leap forward, the textile industry in our province has begun to move towards a situation of flourishing everywhere, scattered like stars in the sky.

**Why the Great Leap Forward?**

Why was there such a leap forward in 1958? We have many profound experiences in this regard:

**The Victory of the General Line for Socialist Construction**

First of all, what we deeply feel, as Premier Zhou pointed out in his report, is that the Party's general line of "going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in building socialism" and the Party's complete set of policies of "walking on two legs" are the most important reasons for the comprehensive leap forward in our work. This general line has not only inspired all our employees and given us infinite power, but also clearly pointed out the direction and methods of the leap forward.

In the textile industry of our province, in the past few years, more attention was paid to improving quality and saving raw materials – that is, the issues of "good" and "economical." There had been considerable debate, and through several years of practice, it was gradually recognized that improving quality and saving raw materials must be fully implemented. However, this only achieved a preliminary unified understanding of the relationship between "good" and "economical." As for high-speed development and the full utilization of existing machines for high-speed operation to vigorously increase production – that is, the aspects of "more" and "faster" – the understanding was insufficient, and even little thought was given to it. Even if there were some tentative experiments, they were turned back when problems were encountered. Naturally, this was also somewhat affected by the insufficient supply of raw cotton in the past. This problem, through the study and implementation of the general line, and driven by the great leap forward in cotton production, and through a series of ideological struggles, criticized various forms of right-leaning conservative thinking and one-sided viewpoints, thus resolving the issue of whether to take the road of "more, faster, better, and more economical" or "less, slower, worse, and more costly" in construction. This improvement in ideological understanding cleared the way for the great leap forward since 1958 and created the preconditions. Therefore, everyone was full of confidence and worked with great enthusiasm, comprehensively focusing on the work of "more, faster, better, and more economical," which led to the comprehensive leap forward in production, technology, capital construction, and other tasks. Therefore, we deeply feel that the achievements of the great leap forward since 1958 were first and foremost the victory of the Party's general line for socialist construction, and the result of the infinite power formed after the masses grasped the general line.

**The Rectification Movement Liberated Thinking and Broke Superstitions**

Furthermore, we also realize that the liberation of thinking and the breaking of superstitions achieved in the great rectification movement proposed by the Party is another important factor in promoting the great leap forward and ensuring the great leap forward. Many examples in the textile industry of our province fully illustrate this point. For example, the universal promotion of high-speed operation in last year's great leap forward, its proposal and final realization, was the result of breaking all kinds of superstitions about ancient and modern, Chinese and foreign practices, and was a victorious achievement of ideological liberation, daring to think and daring to act. When this measure was first proposed, it encountered obstacles from various conservative ideas. Some people believed that such a high speed was not recorded internationally and therefore determined that it was impossible. Some people believed that they had been working in spinning mills for many years and had never seen such a thing, and lacked confidence. Indeed, the high-speed operation that was promoted was unprecedented, and in fact, many technical problems were encountered. However, under the leadership of the Party, all employees refused to be bound by old rules, believed in science, and did not believe in those old sayings. They finally overcame numerous difficulties, making the high-speed operation universally realized and constantly consolidated and improved. Due to the implementation of this measure, according to the statistics of the second half of last year in our province alone, the production of cotton yarn increased by 90,000 pieces and cotton cloth by 870,000 bolts. This achievement would not have been possible without liberating thinking and breaking superstitions. And its realization, in turn, promoted the further liberation of the thinking of our textile industry workers and promoted the comprehensive improvement of technical work. There are many other examples in wool spinning, printing and dyeing, and knitting, which will not be listed here. This shows that the call of the Party Central Committee prepared conditions for our great leap forward ideologically and is a clear proof that the achievements of the rectification movement are embodied as an incomparably powerful material force.

**Taking Steel as the Key Link Became the Driving Force for Promoting Work**

Furthermore, we also realize that the policy of comprehensively leaping forward with steel as the key link proposed by the Party last year had a profound impact on the thinking of our textile workers and became the driving force for promoting work. All the textile workers in our province not only personally smelted more than 16,300 tons of iron and more than 4,670 tons of steel, but also recognized the important significance of ensuring the general takes command if they wanted to develop the textile industry at a high speed. During the battle for steelmaking, they underwent a beneficial exercise, and their fighting spirit to overcome difficulties was greatly improved. At that time, in Shijiazhuang, Handan, and other places, there was a saying: "White girls have become black girls." At that time, people regarded becoming a black girl as the highest glory. After the end of steelmaking, when employees encountered difficulties in production, they often said: "Bring out the spirit of steelmaking." This sentence became a huge force for overcoming difficulties. All these reflect the profound impact that vigorously developing steel had on the thinking of textile workers. Therefore, the textile industry in our province made way and also leaped forward.

**Guiding Work with the Theory of Continuous Revolution**

Furthermore, we also realize that the Party taught us a truth: We are Marxist-Leninist believers in continuous revolution, and at the same time, we are believers in the stages of revolutionary development. Guiding our work with this kind of thinking is of strategic significance. This has also been fully realized from practice. Our high-speed operation last year was proposed in order to welcome the great bumper harvest of cotton and to fully realize the general line of "more, faster, better, and more economical." However, in the process of promoting it, we adopted the method of grasping different key points at different stages and concentrating our efforts to solve the main contradictions in each stage. After the contradictions of one stage are resolved and put into practice, we enter the next stage, and re-arrange forces to concentrate on solving the new contradictions that arise. This can not only move forward continuously, but also avoid unnecessary chaos.

In short, the great leap forward in 1958 was a victory for the Party's general line of "going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in building socialism," and a victory for the Party's policy of "walking on two legs." Currently, we are following the instructions of the Ministry of Textile Industry, focusing on high output and high quality, and striving to fully implement the "four highs and four savings" policy of the textile industry. The prelude to a new and greater leap forward in 1959 has already begun. In the first quarter of this year, the cotton yarn production in our province increased by 100% compared to the same period last year, and by 12% compared to the fourth quarter of last year's great leap forward. We believe that under the leadership of Party committees at all levels, with the efforts of all employees, and on the basis of the great leap forward in 1958, and continuing to learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union, and continuing to learn from the advanced experience of all fraternal regions, we will surely achieve a greater leap forward in 1959 and strive to complete and overfulfill the grand plan centered on steel, coal, grain, and cotton in 1959.

**The Chinese People Cannot Be Deceived**

Finally, I would like to express some opinions on the Tibetan rebellion. Recently, the armed rebellion launched by the former Tibetan local government and a small handful of upper-class reactionary groups, betraying the motherland and brutally harming the Tibetan people, is extremely heinous and intolerable by national law. It is only natural for our Central People's Government to quickly quell these national traitors to relieve the suffering of our Tibetan people. This is a matter for the Chinese people themselves. At this time, some Indian political figures, not only slandered our country like imperialist elements, but even fantasized about using the opportunity of these rebels to kidnap the Dalai Lama to India, fabricating a so-called statement by the Dalai Lama, clamoring for Tibetan independence and plotting to split China, and wanting to turn Tibet into a colony of India. "This is intolerable, what is not?" Tibet is Chinese territory, and we will not allow any country to invade an inch. Now, we warn these Indian political figures, you must not be ignorant of Mount Tai. Cool your arrogant and confused heads with some ice! The era of manipulating China's internal affairs is gone forever. The Chinese people who have stood up cannot be deceived. If you insist on going your own way, you will surely be bruised and battered.

### 河北省的纺织工业空前跃进

专栏：

    河北省的纺织工业空前跃进
    刘持钧代表的发言主席、各位代表、各位委员：
    我完全同意周总理所作的“政府工作报告”和李富春副总理、李先念副总理、彭真副委员长的报告。
    现在我仅就河北省纺织工业一九五八年以来在大跃进中的几点体会谈一下：
    技术革新声势浩大纺织工业遍地开花
    和全国各项工作一样，和全国各兄弟地区的纺织工业一样，一九五八年是我们河北省纺织工业大跃进的一年，在全民整风获得全胜的基础上，在党的社会主义建设总路线的鼓舞下，在以钢为纲的带动下，我们河北省纺织工业无论在生产、技术、基本建设和各项工作上，都出现了空前未有的大跃进的局面。
    一九五八年，我省全年棉纱生产计划提前一个半月胜利完成。在过去，纺织工业有超产的也不过是百分之几，更多的超产被认为是不可能的，但是在一九五八年，我们全年棉纱生产计划完成了百分之一百二十一点三五，比一九五七年增长了百分之五十八点五二；棉布、印染布、和精纺毛织品等，也分别比一九五七年增长了百分之三十到百分之四十。
    在产量增长的同时，产品质量和花色品种也有了很大的发展。一九五八年一年试制成功的新品种有六百多种，新花色有一千八百种。许多过去没有做过的东西，像静电植绒的花布和针织品，凹凸花布，防缩防绉印花布等也在一九五八年投入了生产。
    在生产技术方面，通过声势浩大的技术革命运动，也出现了一个大跃进。一九五八年在我们全省范围内普遍推行了机械运转高速化，其速度水平，尤其是纺机的速度水平，是过去既没有见过，也没有听说过的。这一措施，在不用投资、不增设备、不添人的情况下，使得单位产量平均增长了百分之二十到百分之三十。在技术革命运动中，全省二十多万纺织职工提出了各种革新建议三十多万件，其中已实现或实验成功的已有五万多件。这种声势浩大的群众性的技术革命运动，使我省纺织工业的技术工作大为改观。它冲破了旧的工艺设计，冲破了旧的工艺程序，冲破了旧的生产定额，使得纺织、印染、针织进一步实现和打开了工艺过程缩短化、连续化、自动化、机械化的途径，并为新厂设计提供了有益的资料。
    我省纺织工业的基本建设工作，一九五八年以来，也充分体现了跃进的劲头。例如，保定棉纺一厂，采取了边施工、边安装、边生产的办法，克服了种种供应上的困难，打破常规，厂房还没有盖起，就在仓库里安装了机器开始生产，这个厂是一九五八年五月才开始破土兴建的，但到“八一”前夕，仅仅两个多月的时间，就生产出了第一捆棉纱，这种速度也是以前所没有的。另外，在农村公社化以后，由于贯彻了中央所提出的全民办工业，大中小相结合的方针，我省纺织工业在内地各县人民公社中也有了发展。目前徐水县人民公社纺织厂的土建工程已基本完成，将要开始安装设备；安国等县也正在积极进行纺织厂的建设工作。这标志着大跃进以来我省纺织工业已经开始向着遍地开花、星罗棋布的局面前进了。
    为什么能大跃进？
    为什么在一九五八年会有这样的跃进呢？在这方面我们是有许多深刻体会的：
    社会主义建设总路线的胜利
    首先，我们深深感觉到的，也就是周总理在报告中所指出的，党的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线和党的一整套“两条腿走路”的方针，是使我们的工作得以全面大跃进的最重要的原因。这个总路线，既鼓舞了我们全体职工，赋予了我们无穷的力量，又给我们明确的指出了跃进的方向和方法。
    在我省的纺织工业中，过去的几年来，在提高质量和节约原料——也就是好和省的问题上，打的主意多，也有过相当时期的争论，通过几年的实践，也逐步认识到了提高质量与节约原料必须全面贯彻。然而这只是在好和省的关系上得到了一个初步的统一认识，至于在高速度发展和充分利用现有机器高速运转以大力增产方面——也就是“多”和“快”的方面，则认识不足，甚至想的也很少，即便有点试探性的试验，则遇到问题也就顶回来了，自然这也由于过去原棉供应不足有点影响。这个问题，通过总路线的学习和贯彻，又由于棉花大跃进的带动，透过一系列的思想斗争，批判了形形色色的右倾保守思想和片面观点，因而解决了多快好省还是少慢差费的两条建设路线的问题。这个思想认识上的提高，为一九五八年以来的大跃进扫清了道路，创造了前提，因此，大家信心百倍、干劲十足地全面着眼于多快好省的工作，从而也就导致了生产、技术和基本建设等各项工作的全面跃进。所以我们深深感到，一九五八年以来的大跃进的成绩之所以能够取得，这首先是党的社会主义建设总路线的胜利，是总路线为群众掌握了以后所形成的一股无穷力量的结果。
    整风运动中解放了思想破除了迷信
    再就是我们还体会到，党所提出的在伟大的整风运动中所实现的解放思想、破除迷信，也是促成大跃进，保证大跃进的另一个重要因素。在我省纺织工业中的许多事例都充分可以说明这一点，例如去年大跃进中，普遍推行高速化的问题，它的提出和最后得到实现，就是经过打破对古今中外种种迷信的结果，就是思想解放敢想敢干的一个胜利果实。这一措施初提出时，碰到了各种保守思想的障碍，有的认为这么高的速度，国际上没记载，因而断定不可能；有的认为干了多少年的纱厂，没有见过这种事，信心不足。的确，推行的这种高速化是过去所没有过的，实际上也的确是碰到了许多技术上的问题，但是在党的领导下，全体职工不甘为旧的条条所束缚，相信科学，不迷信那些旧说法，终于战胜了重重困难，使运转高速化普遍实现而且不断的巩固提高。由于这一措施的实现，仅按我省去年下半年的统计，就增产了棉纱九万件，棉布八十七万匹，这个成绩如果不是解放思想、破除迷信是不可能实现的。而它的实现，又反过来促进了我们纺织工业职工思想的进一步解放，推动了技术工作的全面提高。其他如毛纺，印染，针织的事例也还多，这里不多举了。这说明党中央的这一号召，是从思想上为我们的大跃进准备了条件，是整风成果体现为无比强大的物质力量的一个明证。
    以钢为纲成为推动工作的动力
    再就是我们也还体会到，去年党提出的以钢为纲全面跃进的方针，给我们纺织职工在思想上引起了深刻的影响，成为推动工作的动力。我省全体纺织职工，不仅亲手炼出了铁一万六千三百多吨，炼出了钢四千六百七十多吨，而且认识到了要想高速度发展纺织工业，必须保证元帅升帐的重要意义，在炼钢大战中，经受了一场有益的锻炼，克服困难的斗志大大提高了。当时在石家庄、邯郸等地，有这样的说法：“白姑娘变成了黑姑娘”，当时人们都以成为黑姑娘为无尚光荣。在炼钢结束之后，职工们在生产上碰到困难的时候常说：“把炼钢的劲头拿出来”，这句话成了克服困难的巨大力量。这些都反映了大搞钢铁在纺织职工思想上引起的深刻影响，因此我省纺织工业做得既让路又跃进。
    用不断革命论指导工作
    再就是我们还体会到，党教导我们一条真理：我们是马克思列宁主义的不断革命论者，同时又是革命发展的阶段论者。用这种思想来指导我们的工作是具有战略意义的。从实践当中也充分体会到了这一点，我们去年搞高速化，是为了迎接棉花的大丰收，为了全面实现多快好省的总路线而提出的，但在推动的过程中，则采取了在不同阶段抓住不同的重点，集中力量解决每一阶段中的主要矛盾的办法。一个阶段的矛盾解决了，上马了，即进入下一阶段，针对所产生的新矛盾，重新布置力量再集中地加以解决，这样既能不断前进，又可以避免不必要的混乱。
    总之，一九五八年的大跃进，是党的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线的胜利，是党的“用两条腿走路”的方针的胜利。当前我们正在按照中央纺织工业部的指示，以高产高质为中心，为全面贯彻纺织工业的四高四省的方针而奋斗。一九五九年新的更大的跃进序幕已经揭开了，今年第一季度我省棉纱产量比去年同期增加了百分之百，比去年大跃进的第四季度增了百分之十二，我们相信在各级党委的领导下，在全体职工的努力下，在一九五八年大跃进的基础上，并继续学习苏联的先进经验，继续学习各兄弟地区的先进经验，一定能够在一九五九年来个更大的跃进，为完成和超额完成一九五九年的钢煤粮棉为中心的宏伟计划而奋斗。
    中国人民是不可欺的
    最后，我想就西藏叛乱事件发表一点意见。最近，原西藏地方政府和一小撮上层反动集团所发动的背叛祖国残害西藏人民的武装叛乱，实属罪大恶极，国法不容，我中央人民政府对这些民族败类，迅速的加以平定，以解我西藏人民之苦，这本是理所当然的，这是中国人民自己的事。而这时印度的一些政界人士，不但与帝国主义分子们一样对我国大肆侮蔑，竟异想天开地利用这些叛徒劫持达赖喇嘛到了印度的机会，捏造了一个所谓达赖喇嘛的声明，叫嚷什么西藏独立、阴谋分裂中国，想把西藏变为印度的殖民地，“是可忍孰不可忍”。西藏是中国的领土，我们不许任何国家侵略一寸。现在，我们警告这些印度的政界人士，你们不要有眼不识泰山，你们把那些狂妄的发昏的头脑，用冰冷一冷吧！摆布中国内政的时代，已一去不复返了，站起来了的中国人民是不可欺的，如果你们一意孤行，必将碰得头破血流。
