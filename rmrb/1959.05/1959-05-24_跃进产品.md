Leap Forward Products

    Simple Sewing Machine
    Since sewing machines were first made in our country, every ordinary household sewing machine has had 180 parts, which is complex and uses a lot of steel. Workers at the Guangzhou Huanan Sewing Machine Factory were determined to manufacture a simple sewing machine.

    At the beginning of this year, the general assembly workshop of this factory held several symposiums for technical workers to study specific methods of trial production. Workers put forward many valuable opinions, such as canceling the upper wheel sleeve and simplifying the thread take-up part. Technicians absorbed the workers' opinions and carried out new designs. After collective research and repeated trials, a simple sewing machine was finally successfully trial-produced.

    This simple sewing machine has more than 50 fewer parts than the original Huanan brand household sewing machine. It has also made significant modifications to several parts, such as the large connecting rod, comb bed, and winding wheel, using simple parts to replace complex processing. All parts only number more than 120.

    After inspection and trial use, the performance and use of this sewing machine are not only the same as the original, but it also has less noise and can sew in reverse. Producing this simple sewing machine can greatly reduce costs compared to general sewing machines and save 50% of working hours.

    Indigenous Steel Makes Small Hardware
    Guangzhou's daily-use small hardware, known as "Guang goods," has a long history. In the Palace Museum in Beijing, there is a clock that is a fine product of Guangzhou clock artisans from more than 70 years ago.

    This year, in order to produce more and better hardware products, more than 120 large and small hardware factories in the city have launched a production increase and economy movement, deciding to try using indigenous steel as raw material.

    Using indigenous steel to make small hardware products is the result of the workers' hard work, ingenuity, practical work, and collaborative production. To make small hardware from indigenous steel smelted in a reverberatory furnace, it must go through three processes: forging, rolling, and heat treatment. The key lies in forging. Dong Kun, an old worker at Guangzhou Jianguang Hardware Products Factory with more than 20 years of iron forging experience, created a set of operating methods after more than ten days of painstaking experiments. First, he lightly hammers and densely beats it into a square shape, then he heavily hammers it to a long shape, repeatedly forging six times. This ensures that every piece of indigenous steel can be made into useful material. After the indigenous steel is forged, it needs to be rolled. Guangzhou Wire Drawing Factory used the method of "ants gnawing bones" to make a indigenous steel rolling machine from old waste materials to roll the steel into materials of different specifications. Because indigenous steel contains a lot of sulfur and phosphorus, and is brittle and easily broken, it also needs heat treatment. After heat treatment, the indigenous steel material can be punched into various small hardware products in flat and curved shapes using large and small punch presses.

    Now, more than a dozen factories in Guangzhou have officially used indigenous steel to produce bicycle chains, round nails, small knives, thousand-layer locks, nail clippers, and other products. After inspection, the quality fully meets the requirements. For example, the hardness and tensile strength of bicycle chains made of indigenous steel are almost the same as those made of foreign steel.

    Where There's a Will, There's a Way
    People often use "tempered steel" to describe the arduousness of a career. The fact that workers in the Guangzhou battery industry used activated carbon to replace acetylene black smoke and improve quality fully embodies the meaning of this sentence.

    Guangzhou-produced batteries have a large output, accounting for about one-third of the country's total. During the Great Leap Forward last year, the capacity of large batteries was increased due to the improvement of operating procedures and the use of acetylene black smoke, and the continuous discharge time of white light reached more than 700 minutes. However, how can we ensure quality this year without acetylene black smoke?

    The new problem did not stump those who were determined. According to the principle of the air manganese powder cell, battery industry workers proposed adding a small amount of activated carbon to the battery to increase the white light time. The leadership agreed to this suggestion and organized technical personnel and old workers from the entire industry to study it together. They spent a full 25 days, undergoing no less than hundreds of experiments, and finally succeeded. Test results: Adding 8% activated carbon to the battery can increase the white light time by 60 minutes compared to not adding activated carbon, and also extend the shelf life.

    Now, this good method with multiple benefits has been gradually promoted in Guangzhou factories.

    1 vs 45
    At the end of April, a striking new machine appeared in the Guangdong Cigarette Factory. It is currently the first simple flat packaging machine in Guangzhou. On this machine, cigarettes of many brands, such as Red October, are continuously packaged and shipped out in batches. In one minute, it can pack 50 neatly and beautifully packaged cigarettes, equivalent to 45 times the original efficiency.

    The workers of this factory had long wanted a machine to replace manual packaging. However, imported packaging machines require more than one ton of metal materials, and contain many valuable aluminum and high-grade alloy steels, with a total of more than 3,000 parts, which is costly and time-consuming. Li Jinbai, an old technician, decided to manufacture a simple packaging machine himself after visiting a brother factory's packaging machine in another place in March. He and other workers studied and improved the design together. Workers in the factory, from 15-year-old apprentices to 60-year-old technicians, also joined the battle. After 15 days of hard work, the cigarette packaging machine, which was made with only 150 kilograms of waste materials, was finally successful. Its parts have been reduced from more than 3,000 to more than 600, the operation is simple, and the efficiency is very high.

    跃进产品
    简易缝纫机
    从我国有缝纫机以来，每台普通的家用缝纫机，都要有一百八十个零件，既复杂，又费钢材。广州华南缝纫机制造厂的职工，决心制造一种简易缝纫机。
    今年初，这个工厂的总装配车间连续多次召开了技术工人座谈会，研究试制的具体办法，工人们提出许多宝贵意见，如取消上轮套筒，简化打线部分等。技术人员吸收了工人的意见进行新的设计。经过集体研究和反复试制，简易缝纫机终于试制成功。
    这种简易缝纫机，比原来的华南牌家用缝纫机减少了五十多个部件，并且在大链杆、梳床、绕线轮等几个部分也作了很大的修改，用简单零件代替了复杂加工，全部零件只有一百二十多个。
    经过检定和试用，这台缝纫机的性能和用途不仅都和原来的相同，而且噪音较小、还可以倒顺缝纫。生产这种简易缝纫机，比一般缝纫机可以大大降低成本，并可节约工时50％。
    土钢大造小五金
    被称为“广货”的广州市日用小五金，具有悠久的历史。在北京故宫里就有一座时钟，是七十多年前广州钟表艺匠的精制品。
    今年，为了生产更多更好的五金产品，全市一百二十多家大小五金厂开展了增产节约运动，决定试用土钢作原料。
    利用土钢造小五金产品，是职工们实行苦干、巧干、实干和协作生产的结果。要用反射炉炼的土钢制成小五金，必须经过锻、轧、热处理三道工序，关键又在于锻。具有二十多年锻铁经验的广州建光五金制品厂老工人董坤，经过十多天的苦心试验，创造了一套先轻锤密打、锻成方形，再大力下锤、锻成长形，反复锻打六次的操作方法。使锻出来的土钢块块都能成材。土钢锻成后还需要轧，广州拉丝厂又用“蚂蚁啃骨头”的办法，把旧废料制成一台土轧钢机，把钢轧成不同规格的材料。由于土钢含硫、磷多，性脆易断，因而还需要热处理。经过热处理后的土钢材，可以用大、小冲床冲制成平型和弯曲的各种小五金制品。
    现在，广州市已经有十几家工厂正式用土钢生产了单车链条、圆钉、小刀、千层锁、指甲钳等产品。经过检验，质量完全合乎要求，如用土钢制的单车链条的硬度和拉力，都与洋钢制的差不多。
    有志者事竟成
    人们常常用“百炼成钢”来比喻事业的艰巨，广州市电池行业职工用活性炭代替乙炔黑烟又提高质量的事情，充分体现了这句话的意义。
    广州市生产的电池，产量大，约占全国的三分之一左右。去年大跃进中，由于改进操作规程和采用了乙炔黑烟，因而提高了大号电池的电容量，能连续放电白光时间达到七百分钟以上。但是，今年怎样能在没有乙炔黑烟的情况下保证质量呢？
    新问题没有难住有心人。电池行业职工们根据空气锰粉池的原理，提出了在电池中加入少量活性炭，以提高白光时间的创议。领导上同意了这个建议，并且组织了全行业的技术人员和老工人一起研究。他们整整用了二十五天的时间，前后经过不下数百次的试验，终于获得成功。检验结果：在电池中加入8％的活性炭比不加活性炭可增加白光时间六十分钟，同时还延长了耐贮期。
    现在，这个一举几得的好办法已经在广州市工厂中逐步推广。
    1比45
    4月底，广东制烟厂里出现了一台惹人注目的新机器，它就是目前广州市第一台简易平型包装机。在这台机器上，红十月等许多种牌子的香烟源源不断地包装好，成批地出厂。一分钟，可以包好五十包整齐美观的香烟。相当于原来效率的四十五倍。
    这个工厂的职工，老早就想有一台代替手工包装的机器。可是进口的包装机，一台要用一吨多金属材料，里边还有许多贵重的铝和高级合金钢等，共有部件三千多个，本钱大，费的工时又多。老技工李金柏，3月间，在外地参观兄弟厂的包装机回来，就决定自己动手制造一台简便的包装机。他和别的职工一道研究改进设计，厂里职工从十五岁的学徒到六十岁的技工也都投入了这场战斗，经过十五天的苦战，这台只用了一百五十公斤废旧料制成的香烟包装机终于成功了。它的部件由三千多件减少到六百多件，操作简便，效率很高。
