With national assistance and mainland support, the industrial and transportation construction in the Ganzi Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture has developed rapidly in recent years, especially after the Democratic Reform. With the support of the state and other parts of the country, the Autonomous Prefecture has now built and put into production 55 state-owned and local state-owned factories and mines, including iron smelting, coal mining, electricity, paper making, farm tool manufacturing, cement, mining and other types of factories and mines. Last year, the total industrial output value of the prefecture was equivalent to 17.85% of the total agricultural output value, producing 32 kinds of products and a large number of rare industrial raw materials such as mica, beryl, and Iceland spar. The Danba Mica Mine is one of the largest mica mines in China. Last year, more than 600 tons of mica were mined to supply the needs of mainland industry. The Daofu Iron Mine mined more than 200 tons of high-quality ore to support the Chongqing Iron and Steel Company. Before liberation, the entire prefecture had only one dilapidated small hydropower plant. In the high tide of the mass industrialization campaign last year, agricultural areas that had completed the Democratic Reform set up a number of township and commune industries, producing more than 200 kinds of products such as chemical fertilizers, pesticides, and milk powder. Some small factories in Kangding County produced more than 20 million jin of local chemical fertilizer, and manufactured and repaired more than 400,000 pieces of agricultural tools, powerfully supporting agriculture. Before liberation, there were no roads in the whole region. Only rugged trails or post roads connected the main towns, and travel time was calculated in years or months. Since the opening of the Kangding-Tibet Highway, the prefecture has built five new highways, with a total length of 1,325 kilometers. Thirteen of the 21 counties are accessible by car. After the town of Litang in the southern part of the Autonomous Prefecture became accessible, the price of tea dropped from 40 yuan per package to more than 12 yuan, and the price of salt dropped from 1.5 yuan per jin to 0.3 yuan. A large number of machines and new agricultural tools were transported to remote mountain villages, and the local specialties of these areas became best-selling goods. No wonder the Tibetan people call the highway the "golden bridge and jade belt."

With the development of industrial and transportation construction, the ranks of the Tibetan working class have also grown. There are now more than 700 Tibetan workers in the region. With the help of Han workers, they have learned various production techniques. In the Kangding Wool Washing Factory, Tibetan workers, who account for one-quarter of the factory's workers, have generally reached the technical level of second-grade workers. 15% of them have been rated as advanced producers in the Autonomous Prefecture, the province, and the country. The Tibetan Youth Shock Production Team of the Danba Mica Mine is a national advanced production unit.

This year, the industrial and transportation construction of the Autonomous Prefecture will have greater development. The total amount of state planned investment exceeds the total investment of the previous eight years. In addition to expanding some existing factories and mines, various places will also build a number of factories that directly serve agricultural and animal husbandry production. A hydropower station with a power generation capacity of more than 1,300 kilowatts is under construction. This year, the region will also build two new highways, leading to Shiqu, the northernmost pastoral area of the Autonomous Prefecture, and Xiangcheng, the southernmost part.

    国家扶助　内地支援
    工业交通建设发展迅速
    本报讯　甘孜藏族自治州近几年来，特别是民主改革以后，全区的工业交通建设得到了很大的发展。在国家扶助和内地支援下，自治州现在建成投入生产的国营和地方国营厂矿已有五十五个，包括炼铁、采煤、电力、造纸、农具制造、水泥、开矿等各类厂矿。去年，全州工业总产值已经相当于农业总产值的17.85％，生产三十二种产品和大量云母、绿柱石、冰洲石等稀有工业原料。丹巴云母矿是我国最大的云母矿之一，去年开采了六百多吨云母，供应内地工业需用；道孚铁矿开采了二百多吨优质矿石支援重钢。而在解放前，全州仅有一个破旧的小水电厂。完成民主改革的农业区在去年全民办工业的高潮中，办起了一批乡、社工业，生产化肥、农药、奶粉等二百多种产品。康定县的一些小工厂，就生产土化肥两千多万斤，制造和修理了农具四十多万件，有力地支援了农业。解放前，全区没有公路，各主要城镇间只有崎岖的小道或驿道相通，旅行用年、月计算行程。康藏公路通车几年来，全州又新建了五条公路，共长一千三百二十五公里，二十一个县中有十三个县可通汽车。自治州南部重镇理塘县通车后，茶叶由每包四十元降低为十二元多，食盐由每斤一元五角降为三角。大量机器和新式农具运到了遥远的山村，而这些地区的土特产也变成了畅销货。无怪藏族人民把公路称为“金桥玉带”。
    随着工业、交通建设的发展，藏族工人阶级的队伍也成长了起来。现在全区已有藏族工人七百多人。他们在汉族工人的帮助下，学会了各种生产技术。在康定洗毛厂，占全厂工人四分之一的藏族工人，已普遍达到二级工的技术水平，他们中有15％的人，被评为自治州、省和全国先进生产者。丹巴云母矿的藏族青年突击生产队，是全国性的先进生产单位。
    今年，自治州的工业、交通建设将有更大的发展。国家计划投资总额超过了前八年投资的总和。各地除扩建原有一些厂矿外，还要新建一批直接为农、牧业生产服务的工厂。一座发电能力一千三百多瓩的水电站正在加紧施工。今年，全区还要新修两条公路，通往自治州最北的牧区石渠和最南边的乡城。
