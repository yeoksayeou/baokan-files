Xinhua News Agency, 12th: The CCP Central Committee and the State Council's instructions regarding the timely procurement of summer grain and oil crops are as follows in full:

    The harvest season for summer crops such as wheat, barley, naked barley, broad beans, peas, rapeseed, and early rice is approaching. In some southern areas where harvesting starts earlier, some crops are already being brought in. Starting early and preparing to do a good job in this year's summer agricultural tax collection and unified grain and oil procurement is an important task in the current economic work.

    Thanks to the hard work of the broad masses of farmers since last autumn and the general improvement of agricultural cultivation techniques, summer crops are growing well in most areas this year. As long as no major natural disasters occur, a good harvest will be achieved. This is the material foundation for the smooth completion of this year's summer procurement work. At present, we must continue to strengthen field management, which is the key to striving for a bumper summer harvest. Once crops are ripe, sufficient labor should be immediately organized and deployed to seize the time for harvesting, ensuring careful harvesting and threshing, thorough drying and winnowing, clean fields and threshing grounds, and returning every grain to the household, bringing back all the first fruits of victory on the 1959 agricultural front without any loss.

    After the summer harvest, the work of tax collection and unified procurement should be done in conjunction with distribution work and seed, ration, and feed arrangements to complete the procurement tasks with all efforts. This is of great significance for ensuring the supply of grain and oil in urban and rural areas before the autumn grain harvest, and for adjusting the supply of flour and grain varieties in the coming year. Since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the urban employed population has greatly increased, and new construction sites and large and small industrial and mining enterprises have emerged everywhere, which place greater demands on the state for grain and oil. This year's summer agricultural tax collection figures have not increased; although the summer unified procurement tasks have increased slightly, the proportion of unified procurement figures to agricultural output has decreased compared with previous years due to the rapid increase in agricultural production. It should be made clear to cadres at all levels of the communes and all commune members that urban support for rural areas, agricultural support for industry, and mutual support between urban and rural areas are of great significance for building socialism and developing the national economy, and mobilize them to sell surplus grain and oil to the state.

    The summer grain and oil procurement work should be closely combined with the unified sales of grain and edible oil in urban and rural areas. It must be remembered that no matter what, no matter how great a harvest is obtained, the principles of planned distribution, planned consumption, and long-term planning cannot be changed. In rural areas, the problem of farmers' food consumption in the period before the autumn grain harvest should be properly arranged according to the principle of thrift. Collective canteens should use grain in a planned way and pay attention to conservation. In cities, we should also continue to focus on grain sales, verify the population, adhere to the system, and oppose waste. Whether in cities or villages, we should be forward-looking and careful in grain consumption, making a little go a long way, thinking of lean years in times of plenty, and thinking of next year this year.

    Party committees and people's committees at all levels must seriously attach importance to summer procurement work, mobilize all party members, all cadres, and the masses of the people to successfully complete the procurement tasks stipulated by the state. Summer is a season of busy farming and intense work, and grain work must become an important central task for a period of time. This requires us to resolutely implement the principle of quick harvesting, quick threshing, quick procurement, and quick transportation. It requires us to consider this series of tasks together with other tasks, make overall arrangements, and properly arrange each link of this series of tasks from beginning to end, connecting one link to another, striking while the iron is hot, and completing it in one go. What can be done in one day should never be delayed until two days, so as to free up time to concentrate on leading production and engaging in other work. In procurement work, in addition to earnestly carrying out political mobilization, publicizing policies, calculating and assessing tasks, we must also do a solid and orderly job in various specific organizational and operational work such as inspecting grain quality, organizing transportation, weighing and warehousing, settling accounts and making payments. These tasks should not be simply understood as technical work, but should be regarded as political work that specifically embodies the relationship between the state and the peasants. We must prevent sloppy and careless tendencies; we must also prevent simplistic, rigid, and impetuous tendencies. May 9, 1959

### 中共中央  国务院发布指示  及时做好夏季粮食油料征购工作

    中共中央  国务院发布指示
    及时做好夏季粮食油料征购工作
    新华社12日讯  中共中央、国务院关于及时做好夏季粮食、油料征购工作的指示。全文如下：
    目前小麦、大麦、元麦、蚕豆、豌豆、油菜、早稻等夏收作物的收获季节，即将陆续到来，南方一部分收获较早地区，有的作物已经登场。及早动手，有准备地做好今年夏季农业税征收和粮食、油料统购工作，是当前经济工作中的一项重要任务。
    由于去年秋季以来广大农民的辛勤劳作，由于农业耕作技术的普遍改进，今年大部分地区夏收作物生长情况良好，只要不发生重大自然灾害，就会得到较好的收成。这是顺利完成今年夏季征购工作的物质基础。目前要继续加强田间管理，这是当前争取夏收作物丰收的关键。而作物一经成熟，应当立即组织和调配足够的劳动力，抓紧时机，进行收割，做到细收细打，晒干扬净，地净场光，颗粒还家，把一九五九年农业战线上第一批胜利果实全部无遗地拿回来。
    在夏收作物收获以后，应当结合分配工作和种籽、口粮、饲料的安排，及时做好征收和统购工作，全力完成征购任务，这对于保证秋粮登场以前的城乡粮食供应和油脂供应，对于今后一年中面粉供应和粮食品种的调剂，具有重要的意义。一九五八年大跃进以来，城市就业人口有了大量的增加，新的建筑工地和大大小小的工矿企业到处出现，它们对国家提出更大的粮食和油脂的要求。今年夏季农业税征收数字没有增加；夏收统购任务虽然有若干增加，但是由于农业生产的迅速提高，统购数字占农业产量的比例却比往年降低了。应当向公社各级干部和全体社员讲清楚，乡村支援城市，农业支援工业，城乡互相支援，对于建设社会主义，发展国民经济具有十分重要的意义，动员他们把多余的粮食和油料卖给国家。
    夏季粮食、油料的征购工作，应当同城乡粮食、食油统销工作密切结合起来。必须记住，无论什么时候，无论获得多么大的丰收，计划分配、计划消费、长期打算的原则是不能改变的。在农村中，要根据节约的原则，把农民在秋粮登场以前这一段时间内的吃粮问题，妥善加以安排。集体食堂要有计划地用粮，注意节约。在城市中也应当继续抓紧粮食销量，核实人口，坚持制度，反对浪费。无论城市和乡村，在粮食消费上都应当瞻前顾后，细水长流，丰收的时候想到歉收，今年想到明年。
    各级党委和各级人民委员会必须认真重视夏季征购工作，动员全体党员、全体干部和人民群众，圆满完成国家规定的征购任务。夏季正是农事繁忙、工作紧张的季节，而粮食工作又必须成为一个时期重要的中心任务，这就要求我们坚决实行快收、快打、快征购、快运送的原则。要求我们把这一系列的工作，同其他工作统一考虑，全面安排，把这一系列工作的各个环节，从头到尾，妥善布置，一环扣一环，趁热打铁，一气呵成。一天能办的事情决不要拖到两天，以便及时腾出手来，集中力量领导生产和从事其他工作。在征购工作中，除了认真进行政治动员、宣传政策、计算和评定任务以外，还必须踏踏实实、有条不紊地做好有关检验粮质、组织运送、过秤入仓、结账付款等各项具体组织工作和业务工作。这些工作不能单纯了解为技术性的工作，而应当把它看作是具体体现国家同农民关系的政治性的工作。一定要防止了草粗糙、放任自流的倾向；也一定要防止简单从事、生硬急躁的倾向。  一九五九年五月九日
