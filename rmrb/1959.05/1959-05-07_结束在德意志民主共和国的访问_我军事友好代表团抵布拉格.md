Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 6th: The Chinese Military Friendship Delegation headed by Marshal Peng Dehuai arrived in Prague by plane this morning.

Those who greeted the delegation at the airport included Barak, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Czechoslovak Communist Party and Deputy Prime Minister; Lomszky, Minister of National Defense; Hajek, Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs; Rytíř, Chief of the General Staff of the Czechoslovak People's Army; as well as senior generals and officers of the People's Army. Cao Ying, the Chinese Ambassador to Czechoslovakia, and diplomatic envoys from various countries also greeted the delegation at the airport.

After disembarking from the plane, Marshal Peng Dehuai shook hands with the welcomers one by one. Then, accompanied by Minister Lomszky, he reviewed the guard of honor and accepted flowers from a group of Young Pioneers. At this moment, the thousands of representatives of the People's Army who greeted the delegation at the airport shouted slogans such as "Long live Czech-Chinese friendship!"

In his welcoming speech, Lomszky extended a warm welcome to the Chinese Military Friendship Delegation on behalf of the Czechoslovak people and army. He said that the Czechoslovak people have deep friendship and admiration for the Chinese people. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese people overcame imperialism, seized power, and achieved great achievements. The victory and achievements of the Chinese people are also the victory and achievements of the entire socialist camp.

Next, Marshal Peng Dehuai spoke. He said that they were very happy to be able to visit the fraternal country on the eve of the National Day of the Czechoslovak Republic. He then extended brotherly greetings and pre-holiday congratulations to all comrades of the Czechoslovak people and army on behalf of the Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army.

Marshal Peng Dehuai said that the Chinese and Czech people, united in the big family of the socialist camp, are carrying out socialist construction with full confidence. The friendship between our two peoples and armies is constantly being consolidated and developed. The visit of the Czechoslovak Military Delegation to China at the end of 1957 made valuable contributions to strengthening the friendship between the Chinese and Czech peoples and armies. We believe that this visit of the Chinese Military Friendship Delegation will further enhance our brotherly friendship. We will also learn from the advanced experience of the Czechoslovak People's Army during this visit.

After the speech, the delegation, accompanied by Lomszky, circled the field to thank the welcomers.

At this time, the army representatives who welcomed the delegation shouted friendship slogans and enthusiastically rushed towards the delegation.

Today, major newspapers in Prague published photos and biographies of Marshal Peng Dehuai.

"People's Defense Daily" also published an editorial entitled "Unbreakable Friendship" to welcome the Chinese Military Friendship Delegation.
