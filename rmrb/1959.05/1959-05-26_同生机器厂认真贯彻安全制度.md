    Safety for Production, Production Must Be Safe
    Tongsheng Machine Factory Conscientiously Implements Safety Regulations
    Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, May 25th: The Guangzhou Tongsheng Machine Factory has adopted a method combining education, protection, and the establishment of regulations to ensure safe production. Last year, the factory's labor productivity increased by 100%, while work-related injuries significantly decreased. From January to May 15th of this year, work-related injuries decreased by more than half compared to the same period last year.
    Walking into the factory's various workshops, one can see many big-character posters, cartoons, and poems related to safe production. On the wall near a female apprentice's workstation in the mechanical workshop, there is a cartoon of a female worker's braid getting caught in a machine, with a few clapper verses written below: "Belts winding around, gears turning everywhere, braids hanging down are truly dangerous, female workers wear hats for safety." It turned out that this female apprentice was unwilling to wear a safety helmet at work, so the safety technician used this method to educate her. Afterwards, she always tucked her braids into her hat when she came to work. At the entrance of the mechanical workshop, there is also a long clapper poem, which describes the safe production methods of many types of work, including the line: "When working at heights, pay attention to the scaffolding, fasten your safety belt, and nothing will happen." The workers find this kind of simple and vivid education very easy to accept.
    For new workers, the factory has stipulated a three-level safety education system: After entering the factory, safety technicians give a three-day course explaining the knowledge of safe production. Only after passing the examination can they enter the workshop. After entering the workshop, the workshop director and production team leader continue to educate them, so that new workers quickly establish the idea of safe production and become familiar with the safety precautions.
    In addition to strengthening ideological education, the factory also pays attention to establishing various necessary protective equipment. In the workshop, each lathe is equipped with a wooden protective baffle, the gears of the machine tools are equipped with net-like wooden protective covers, each belt is equipped with a belt slot, and grinding wheel workers and electric welding auxiliary workers wear protective glasses to prevent work-related injuries during the production process.

### 同生机器厂认真贯彻安全制度

    安全为了生产  生产必须安全
    同生机器厂认真贯彻安全制度
    据新华社广州25日电  广州同生机器厂采取教育、防护和订立制度相结合的方法，保证安全生产。全厂去年劳动生产率增长了一倍，而工伤事故却大大减少。今年1月到5月15日，工伤事故又比去年同期减少一半以上。
    走进这个工厂的各个车间，可以看到许多有关安全生产的大字报、漫画和诗歌。在机械车间一个女徒工工作岗位附近的墙壁上，贴有一幅女工的辫子被机器卷住的漫画，下面写了几句快板诗：“皮带两头卷，齿轮处处转，发辫垂下真危险，女工戴帽保安全。”原来这个女徒工上班时不愿戴安全帽，安全技术员就用这个办法对她进行教育，以后她一上班就把辫子塞在帽子里了。在机械车间的门口，还贴着一首长的快板诗，诗中写着许多工种的安全生产方法，其中有一段是：“高空作业时，架板要注意，系上安全带，就唔（不）会出事”的句子。工人们对这样通俗生动的教育，都很容易接受。
    对于新工人，这个厂规定了三级安全教育的制度：进厂后，先由安全技术员上课三天，讲解安全生产的知识，经过考查合格才进车间；进入车间后，又由车间主任和生产组长接连进行教育。使新工人迅速树立安全生产的思想和熟悉安全生产应注意的事项。
    除了加强思想教育外，这个厂还注意建立各种必要的防护设备。在车间里，每个车床前面都装有木制的防护挡板，机床齿轮上装有网状的木制防护罩，每条皮带下面都安上了皮带槽，磨砂轮工和电焊辅助工都戴上了防护镜，防止工人们在生产过程中发生工伤事故。
