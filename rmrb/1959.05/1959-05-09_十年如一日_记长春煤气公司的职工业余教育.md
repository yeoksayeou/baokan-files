　　Ten Years as One Day
　　——On the Staff and Workers' Spare-Time Education at the Changchun Gas Company
　　By Our Correspondent Wang Wenlian
    Under the leadership of the Party, the Changchun Gas Company has closely integrated with production and persisted in staff and workers' spare-time education for ten years as one day, enabling all workers in the factory to reach a cultural level above elementary school and enter the study of courses at or above the secondary school level, thereby leading to a leap forward in the factory's production.
    The Gas Company is an old factory with a history of more than thirty years. Before liberation, almost all the workers were illiterate. In the early days of restoring production after liberation, there were only forty or fifty workers. At that time, the factory did not have a single engineering or technical staff member. They relied on the experience of old workers to repair the relatively complex five-pan gas generators. The factory director, Party branch secretary, and chairman of the trade union were all promoted from among the old workers, so they were also illiterate. They couldn't write summaries or make plans, and encountered many difficulties in their leadership work. In order to restore and develop production, the entire factory, from top to bottom, urgently demanded to learn. The receiving representative seized on this point and, combined with production, started by teaching workers to recognize their own names and then to recognize the names of all the factory's tools, machines, and equipment, using pictures to deepen their memory. Later, the number of workers in the factory gradually increased, and they began to divide the workers into two classes, using their spare time. One class read literacy textbooks to eliminate illiteracy, and the other class studied arithmetic and Chinese to improve their cultural level. If there were no classrooms, they would hold classes in the office. If there were not enough teachers, they would hire students from nearby middle schools or staff members from the mass cultural center, or have workers with slightly higher cultural levels teach those with lower levels, overcoming various difficulties and persisting in learning.
    On this basis, they established a staff and workers' spare-time school, hired full-time teachers, and stipulated that evening spare-time study would be conducted for one and a half to two hours each day. For long-term consideration, the Party general branch also appropriately arranged the proportion of study according to the workers' poor foundation in physics and chemistry and their low level in Chinese and arithmetic, with four days a week for cultural classes and one day each for political and technical classes. Because the staff and workers' spare-time education was well integrated with production, the staff and workers have been able to persist in learning for a long time. By 1953, illiteracy had been basically eliminated among the old workers in the factory. By 1955, they had generally completed elementary school courses. In 1956 and 1957, they successively entered junior high school.
    After the workers improved their cultural level, they applied what they learned, summarized production experience, and improved operations, which played a significant role in production and management. From 1949 to last year, due to the continuous improvement of workers' political, cultural, and technical levels, more than sixty people have been promoted to leading cadres and technical personnel such as factory directors, Party committee secretaries, trade union chairmen, workshop directors, and work section leaders. Almost every aspect of production in the factory has also undergone major reforms. The coking speed has been shortened from more than ten hours per furnace to eight hours. The refining equipment has increased from transporting 60,000 cubic meters of gas per day to 90,000 cubic meters. In addition, the factory has also sent some old workers to help other regions or units build gas factories. After learning chemistry, the old worker Liu Xuedao, with reference to relevant reference books, summarized his own experience and created a three-purpose stove that can cook, heat, and boil water at the same time in the same furnace, as well as more than ten other types of gas stove equipment. After learning physics, the old worker Bian Yuzhong used the principle of leverage to improve the tool scraper, increasing carbon black production threefold. He also mastered relevant knowledge of acids and bases through self-study in chemistry. Based on the principle that cresol is easily soluble in water, he changed the raw material ratio of cresol, saving raw materials and reducing the loss rate by 35%.
    The Changchun Gas Company is a comprehensive enterprise that can produce gas and various coal chemical products. However, for a long time, the entire factory basically only produced three products: gas, tar, and coke. In order to achieve the comprehensive utilization of coal and produce more products, last August, the factory's staff and workers' spare-time school further integrated politics, technology, and culture in the arrangement of courses, and combined production, education, and scientific research. All workers, leading cadres, and engineering and technical personnel in the factory were organized to study according to their levels, production shifts, and different needs. Teachers and researchers from Jilin Normal University, Jilin University, Changchun No. 10 Middle School, and the Jilin Branch of the Chinese Academy of Sciences were invited as consultants to give special lectures to the staff and workers. Engineers, technicians, and experienced old workers from the factory served as instructors for technical courses. From leaders to workers, the entire factory's enthusiasm for learning was high, and staff and workers' study never stopped for a day.
    In the teaching process, the Party committee attached great importance to the leadership of the staff and workers' spare-time school. For example, the teaching leading group organized by the Party committee, consisting of Party committee members, engineering and technical personnel, full-time teachers, and old workers, went deep into the workshops to investigate and study the basic knowledge of physics, chemistry, and mathematics related to the operation of each type of work and the needs of production. After that, they compiled more than ten kinds of teaching materials such as carbon black, machinery, coking, pipeline, business management, arithmetic, Chinese, physics, and chemistry. The content of these teaching materials is closely integrated with the actual production and takes into account the learning characteristics of adults. Secondly, in terms of teaching methods, they also changed the past shortcomings of more classroom lectures and less practice, making it difficult to consolidate learning results, so that students listen less and practice more in the classroom, and consolidate learning results at any time. Therefore, learning efficiency has rapidly improved. Up to now, in just eight months, all workers in the factory, due to learning the knowledge of coal dry distillation in chemistry, have been able to design and manufacture a highly efficient gas generator. After the furnace is built, it only takes three or four hours to make gas. After learning the combustion principles of carbon and oxygen, the workers in the carbon black workshop adjusted the ratio of oxygen and carbon so that carbon would not be fully burned, thereby increasing carbon black production fivefold. The daily output of gas has also increased from 90,000 cubic meters in 1958 to more than 110,000 cubic meters now. The number of products in the factory has also increased from six before the establishment of the staff and workers' spare-time school to seventeen now. The scientific research group composed of old workers, engineers, and leading cadres has successfully researched several important new technologies around the key technical problems of production, and has compiled five books on the comprehensive utilization of coal, four of which have been published and have been welcomed by readers and relevant parties. The scientific research results of the old workers are both solutions to key production problems and teaching materials for the staff and workers' spare-time school, which promotes both learning and production.

　　十年如一日
　　——记长春煤气公司的职工业余教育
　　本报记者　王文琏
    长春市煤气公司在党的领导下，紧密地结合生产，十年如一日地坚持职工业余教育，使全厂工人达到高小以上文化程度，分别进入中等以上学校课程的学习，从而使全厂生产，呈现出飞跃的发展。
    煤气公司是一个三十多年历史的老工厂。解放前，工人们几乎全部都是文盲；解放后，恢复生产初期，只有四、五十名工人。当时，工厂没有一个工程技术人员，凭老工人的经验修复了设备比较复杂的五盘煤气发生炉；而厂长、党支部书记、工会主席因为是刚从老工人中提拔起来的，所以也是文盲。不会写总结，订计划，做领导工作遇到很多困难，为了要恢复生产、发展生产，全厂从上到下，迫切要求学习。接收代表抓住这一点，结合生产，从教工人认识自己的名字开始到教会工人认识全厂各种工具、机器设备的名称，并配合图画，加深记忆。后来全厂的工人逐渐增加，开始把工人分成两个班，利用业余时间，一班读识字课本，扫除文盲；一班学习算术、语文，提高文化。没有教室就在办公室里上课；教员不够，就聘请附近中学学生或群众文化馆馆员担任，或由文化水平稍高的工人教给低的，克服种种困难，坚持学习。
    在这基础上，办起了职工业余学校，聘请了专职教员，规定了每天晚间一个半至两个小时进行业余学习。为了长远打算，党总支还根据工人理、化基础差，语文、算术水平低的情况，适当地安排了学习比例，每周四天文化课，政治、技术课各一天。由于职工业余教育同生产结合的好，所以职工学习长期能够坚持下来。到1953年，全厂老工人中已基本扫除文盲；1955年普遍学完了高小课程；1956和1957年相继进入初中。
    工人们提高了文化以后，运用学习成果，总结生产经验，改进操作，在生产和管理上发生了重大作用。从1949年到去年为止，由于工人政治、文化、技术的不断提高，已先后有六十多人被提拔为厂长、党委书记、工会主席、车间主任和工段长等领导干部和技术人员；厂内的生产也几乎样样发生了重大改革。炼焦速度由十几小时一炉缩短为八个小时；精制设备由一天输送六万立方公尺煤气提高到九万立方公尺，另外工厂还派出部分老工人帮助其它地区或单位建设煤气工厂。老工人刘学道学习了化学以后，参照有关的参考书，总结了自己的经验，创造了一种在同一时间，同一炉子上同时做饭、取暖、烧水的三用炉，以及其它十几种煤气炉设备。老工人卞玉忠学习了物理以后，利用杠杆原理，改进了工具刮刀，提高炭黑产量三倍。他还在自修化学中，掌握了有关酸碱知识；根据炭酸易溶于水的原理，改变了甲酚的原料配比，节省了原料，使损失率减少了35％。
    长春市煤气公司是一个综合性企业，能生产煤气和多种煤的化工产品。但是长期以来，全厂基本上只生产了煤气、焦油和焦炭三种产品，为了达到煤的综合利用，生产更多的产品，去年8月，工厂职工业余学校，在课程的安排上，进一步把政治、技术、文化结合起来；把生产、教育、科学研究结合起来。把全厂工人、领导干部、工程技术人员，按程度、生产班次和需要不同，全部组织学习。并聘请了吉林师范大学、吉林大学、长春市第十中学、中国科学院吉林分院等单位的教员、研究员作为顾问，给职工们作专题讲课。本厂工程师、技术员和生产经验丰富的老工人担任技术课讲授。全厂从领导到工人，学习情绪高涨，职工学习没有一天间断过。
    在教学过程中，党委很重视对职工业余学校的领导。例如党委组织的由党委委员、工程技术人员、专职教员和老工人组成的教学领导小组，深入车间调查、研究每个工种的操作和生产中所需要的有关物理、化学、数学等基础知识后，编写出炭黑、机械、炼焦、管路、企业管理、算术、语文、物理、化学等十几种教材。这些教材内容，都是密切结合生产实际，照顾成年人的学习特点。其次在教学方法上，也改变了过去课堂讲授多、练习少，学习成果不易巩固的缺点，使学员在课堂上少听多练，随时巩固学习成果。因此，学习效率迅速提高。到目前为止，仅八个月的时间，全厂工人由于学习了化学中有关煤的干馏等知识，已能设计和制造出一座效率极高的煤气发生炉。炉子建成后，只需三、四个小时就能制成煤气。炭黑车间工人学习了有关碳和氧的燃烧原理后，调整了氧和碳的比例，不使碳达到充分燃烧，由此使炭黑产量翻了五番。煤气的日产量也由1958年的九万立方公尺达到现在的十一万立方公尺以上。全厂的产品也由开办职工业余学校前的六种增加到现在的十七种；由老工人、工程师和领导干部组成的科学研究组，已经围绕着生产技术关键问题，研究成功几项重要的新技术，编写出五本有关煤的综合利用书籍，其中有四本已经出版，受到读者欢迎和有关方面的重视。老工人的科学研究成果，既是解决生产关键问题的方案，又是职工业余学校的教材，既推动了学习又推动了生产。（附图片）
