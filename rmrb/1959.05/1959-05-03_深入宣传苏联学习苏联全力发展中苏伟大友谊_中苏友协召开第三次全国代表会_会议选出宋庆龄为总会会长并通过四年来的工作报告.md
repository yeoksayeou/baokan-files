No force in the world can separate the people of our two countries, and no force can stop the continuous development and consolidation of friendly cooperation between our two countries.

    Qian Junrui said that we must continue to publicize the Soviet Union and earnestly learn from the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union is the best example for us to learn from. We must promote the people of the whole country to continue to work hard, combining with the specific conditions of our country, to learn from the Soviet people and earnestly learn from their advanced experience and scientific and technological achievements, so as to build socialism in a more, faster, better, and more economical way.
