What is tragedy?
　　After reading Indian Prime Minister Nehru's speech in the Indian Lok Sabha on the 27th, one cannot help but feel very angry.
　　Nehru has repeatedly stated in the past that he would adhere to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. In this speech, he also said that he "very much hopes to maintain friendship between India and China" and "does not want to interfere in Tibet at all." However, where in the entire speech does it show the actual content of these few sentences?
　　Nehru said that "a tragedy has occurred and is occurring in Tibet." Indeed, for thousands of years, Tibet has preserved the darkest, most backward, and most cruel serf system in the world, which cannot but be said to be a historical tragedy. Recently, Tibetan insurgents launched an open rebellion, killing and setting fires everywhere, committing rape and looting. The Khampa rebels who participated in this rebellion were even a group of beasts. They wantonly killed people, gouged out eyes, cut off noses, pulled tendons, chopped off hands, broke legs, cut open abdomens, gouged out hearts, skinned people alive, and buried them alive. They pulled out women's hair one by one, chopped people into mincemeat, and pierced people's heads with red-hot iron wires… Such extremely cruel and barbaric behavior is truly a rare tragedy in the world. The Tibetan people deeply hated this group of rebels. They actively assisted the People's Liberation Army in quelling the rebellion. They called the People's Liberation Army "Bodhisattva soldiers" and Chairman Mao "Buddha."
　　Now this tragedy is nearing its end. Contrary to the wishes of the imperialists, Indian expansionists, and the Tibetan traitorous clique, the rebellion of the Tibetan reactionaries and the suppression of the rebellion have promoted the unity of our motherland and the rebirth of the Tibetan people. There is no doubt that after smashing these heavy shackles on the Tibetan people, the Tibetan people will surely be able to build a paradise on earth on the Tibetan plateau. The Tibetan nationality will surely become an economically prosperous, culturally developed, and happy nation, just like all the fraternal nationalities in the country.
　　The above are completely well-founded facts. Only those who speak with their eyes closed would ignore these living facts. Turning bad things into good things and good things into bad things is the logic of imperialism. But it is strange that Prime Minister Nehru also reversed black and white and started saying such things, which cannot help but surprise and anger people.

　　Facts speak louder than words
　　Indian Prime Minister Nehru's speech in the Indian Lok Sabha on April 27 not only distorted the basic facts of the rebellion launched by a small number of reactionary elements in Tibet but also directly came forward to defend Indian expansionists.
　　Prime Minister Nehru said that India has absolutely no ulterior motives in Tibet. Therefore, the claim about Indian expansionists is inappropriate and unfounded. What grand words! However, why did Mehta, leader of the Indian People's Socialist Party, clamor that "the relationship between India and Tibet is a mother-child relationship" and that "it is wrong to regard Tibet entirely as China's internal affairs"? Why did Narayan, leader of the Indian Socialist Party, openly declare: "According to the old agreement between the British and the Chinese, the latter possesses suzerainty over Tibet, while the former enjoys a monopoly on developing that country," and said that India is the successor to the former, etc. As for India's reactionary newspapers, they have also blatantly proposed interfering in our country's measures to quell the rebellion and making Tibet secede from the motherland and become a buffer state for India. Mr. Nehru, how would you explain these remarks? Doesn't this fully prove the shameful faces of a small group of greedy expansionists in India?
　　The facts are very clear. The problem is not that the Chinese side is making necessary warnings due to being forced. The problem is that there is indeed a small group of expansionists in India. Therefore, what Prime Minister Nehru said, that "the claim about Indian expansionists is inappropriate and unfounded," only proves that he himself is afraid to face the facts. We firmly oppose this act of denying and distorting facts by Indian Prime Minister Nehru.

　　Strange logic
　　In his speech in the Indian Lok Sabha on the 27th, Prime Minister Nehru blamed the Chinese public opinion circles' counterattack against the interferers as an unfounded accusation, using the language of the Cold War.
　　Who exactly is "making unfounded accusations"? May I ask Mr. Nehru, when we say that Tibet is a part of Chinese territory and that the Tibetan issue is China's internal affair and does not allow foreign interference, is this unfounded? And when Indian expansionists say that India and Tibet have a "mother-child relationship" and that the Tibetan issue should be "resolved" with India's participation, is that well-founded? Indeed, to deny that Tibet is Chinese territory requires "great imagination and disregard for obvious facts." To describe our people's righteous and stern rebuttal as an "unfounded accusation" and to describe the Indian expansionists' malicious attacks as "sympathy for the Tibetan people" can only be done by those with that unique "great imagination" and "disregard for obvious facts."
　　We have already learned enough about "the language of the Cold War" from the Indian expansionist newspapers. They clamor for "Tibetan independence," clamor that "China threatens India's security," and clamor that "China has territorial expansion ambitions," and so on. Not only that, but the Indian expansionists have progressed from "the language of the Cold War" to "the actions of the Cold War." They organize marches, draw cartoons, and throw tomatoes to insult the images of our national leaders, etc. They feel that the Cold War is not enough and want to carry out a hot war. The General Secretary of the Indian People's League plans to send "volunteer soldiers" to Tibet to participate in the so-called "struggle for freedom against the Chinese." May I ask Mr. Nehru, who exactly is using "the language of the Cold War," and who exactly is conducting "the Cold War" and "the hot war"? Mr. Nehru speaks of maintaining friendly relations between China and India, but he turns a blind eye to all these languages of "the Cold War" and "the hot war." Instead, "regardless of the facts and etiquette," he describes our people's righteous indignation and patriotic behavior as "unfounded accusations." What kind of logic is this?

　　Who is "disregarding the facts"?
　　In his speech in the Indian Lok Sabha on April 27, Indian Prime Minister Nehru described our people's counterattack against Indian expansionists as "disregarding the facts and etiquette and using the language of the Cold War." We cannot help but ask, who is "disregarding the facts"? Who is "disregarding etiquette"? Who is "using the language of the Cold War"?
　　We still remember that when our People's Daily published the three letters from the Dalai Lama to General Tan Guansan, the Indian expansionists said that they were "fabricated." After the People's Daily published photographs of the letters, the Indian expansionists still did not believe this "fact." Even Nehru himself "disregarded the facts" and "expressed doubt." It was not until Nehru met with the Dalai Lama that he had to admit that it was indeed written by the Dalai Lama himself. From this incident, we want to ask, who exactly is "disregarding the facts"?
　　We still remember how many slanderous and abusive remarks against our country were published in Indian newspapers after the Tibetan rebellion occurred, and even some cartoons insulting Chairman Mao, the leader beloved by our people, were published. What is particularly serious is that under the connivance of the Indian police, a serious incident of insulting our leader occurred in Mumbai. In contrast, our people are still suppressing their infinite indignation and insisting on carrying out a rational struggle with the Indian expansionists. We want to ask, who exactly is "disregarding etiquette"?
　　We still remember that after the Tibetan rebellion occurred, some newspapers in India have been clamoring about "Tibet is dead," demanding "Tibetan independence," and even demanding that a "round table conference" be held in India with the participation of China, India, and Tibetan rebels to discuss the "Tibetan issue," which is purely our internal affair. The Indian leaders have not taken friendly measures against these outrageous remarks. On the contrary, they say that "we have relaxed the standards of freedom of speech very widely." We want to ask, who is "using the language of the Cold War," and who has "relaxed" the "standards" for "using the language of the Cold War"?

　　"Regret" and "Sadness"
　　Mr. Nehru's speech on the Tibetan issue in the People's House on April 27 was a speech that was extremely unfriendly to the Chinese people and was a harmful speech that rudely accused the Chinese government.
　　Before and after the Tibetan rebellion, some reactionary newspapers in India and Indian expansionists made a big fuss, openly slandering our country and interfering in our internal affairs, to the point that a small group of rioters in Mumbai openly insulted the portrait of our beloved Chairman Mao. Regarding these remarks and actions that undermine Sino-Indian friendship, Mr. Nehru, on the one hand, expressed "regret," and on the other hand, defended them, saying that "these are not political," but only "national feelings" and "momentary impulses," etc. At the same time, Mr. Nehru, disregarding well-known facts, insisted on saying that "the accusations made by China against India are so absurd," and that "the language of the comments and accusations made by responsible Chinese officials against India is the language of the Cold War," and felt "sad" about this for no factual basis. In fact, the real "absurd accusation" is Prime Minister Nehru's speech. Everyone knows that the Chinese people value "friendship," and have always restrained themselves, hoping that India would not interfere in China's internal affairs, and hoping to maintain friendly relations between China and India, but when the behavior of certain newspapers and certain people in India has exceeded the limits of the most restrained Chinese people, why can't we fight back against those expansionists and ambitious people? Why can't we point out the truth? Is this "absurd accusation"?
　　Mr. Nehru is good at treating problems without regard to objective facts, and this time, he even wants to "shift the blame" and push the blame for India's mistakes onto China, but facts are always facts! It does not allow anyone to change or distort them at will.
　　In this not-so-long speech by Mr. Nehru, he denied the untruth of the so-called "Dalai Lama's statement," saying that he "wishes to make it clear that the Dalai Lama is fully responsible for this statement and the latter statement." This makes people "not quite understand" why someone else is "fully responsible" for something, but it comes from another person's mouth? And this person happens to be the one who insists that he has nothing to do with this matter. In addition, Nehru also denied that "India has unspeakable ambitions in Tibet," and so on. In short, this speech by Nehru and his several talks have a common characteristic, that is, they are full of contradictions and are very unobjective.

### 事实并不是像尼赫鲁所说的那样——读者研究尼赫鲁4月27日在印度人民院的讲话后的来信

    事实并不是像尼赫鲁所说的那样
    ——读者研究尼赫鲁4月27日在印度人民院的讲话后的来信
    什么是悲剧？
    读了印度总理尼赫鲁27日在印度人民院的讲话以后，不能不感到非常气愤。
    尼赫鲁过去一再表示要坚持五项原则，在这次讲话中也说“非常希望保持印度和中国之间的友谊”，“一点也不想干涉西藏”，但是在全篇讲话中，什么地方表明了这几句话的实际内容呢？
    尼赫鲁说什么“西藏发生了而且正在发生着悲剧”。的确，千百年来，在西藏仍然保存着世界上最黑暗、最落后、最残酷的农奴制度，不能不说是历史上的悲剧。最近，西藏叛乱分子发动了公开的叛乱，到处杀人放火，奸淫掳掠。参加这次叛乱的康巴叛乱分子，更是一群野兽，他们随意残杀人民，挖眼睛、割鼻子、抽脚筋、砍手、断脚、割腹、剜心、剥皮、活埋，把妇女的头发一根根拔掉，把人剁成肉酱、烧红铁丝穿人头……这种极端残酷、野蛮的行为，也真正是世界上少有的悲剧。西藏人民对这群叛乱分子是深恶痛绝的，他们积极协助人民解放军平息叛乱，他们称解放军是“菩萨兵”，称毛主席是“佛”。
    现在这幕悲剧已经接近闭幕。与帝国主义、印度扩张主义分子和西藏叛国集团的愿望相反，西藏反动分子的叛乱和叛乱的平息，促进了我们祖国的统一，促进了西藏人民的新生。毫无疑问，在粉碎了这些套在西藏人民身上的重重枷锁以后，西藏人民一定能够在西藏高原上建设起人间的天堂。西藏民族一定会同国内各兄弟民族一样，成为一个经济繁荣、文化发展和生活幸福的民族。
    以上这些是完全有根据的事实真相。除非闭着眼睛说话的人才不顾这些活生生的事实。把坏事说成好事，好事说成坏事，原是帝国主义的逻辑。但是奇怪的是像尼赫鲁总理也颠倒黑白说起这种话来，不能不使人十分惊异和气愤。

    事实胜于雄辩
    印度总理尼赫鲁4月27日在印度人民院的讲话，不仅歪曲了西藏少数反动分子发动叛乱的起码的事实，而且直接出面为印度扩张主义分子辩护。
    尼赫鲁总理说，印度对西藏根本不存在任何不可告人的目的。因此，关于印度扩张主义分子的说法是不适当的也是没有根据的。这是多么堂皇的话句啊！可是，印度人民社会党领袖梅达为什么要叫嚣“印度和西藏的关系是母子关系”和“把西藏完全看作是中国内政那是错误的”呢？印度社会党领导人纳拉扬为什么要公开宣称：“根据英国人和中国人的旧协定，后者拥有对西藏的宗主权、而前者对西藏享有发展那个国家的垄断权”并说印度是前者的继承人等等。至于印度的反动报刊，还露骨地提出过要干涉我国平叛措施，要使西藏脱离祖国大家庭而成为印度的一个缓冲国，请问尼赫鲁先生，这些言论又作如何解释呢？难道这不是已经充分的证明了印度的一小撮贪婪的扩张主义分子可耻的嘴脸了吗？
    事实很明显。问题不在于中国方面由于被迫而进行必要的警告，问题是在于印度方面的的确确存在着一小撮的扩张主义分子。因此尼赫鲁总理所说的，“关于印度扩张主义分子的说法是不适当的和没有根据的问题。只不过证明他自己是不敢正视事实罢了。对印度总理尼赫鲁这种否认事实和歪曲事实的作法，我们是坚决反对的。

    奇怪的逻辑
    尼赫鲁总理27日在印度人民院的讲话中，责备中国舆论界对干涉者的反击是毫无根据的指责，使用冷战的语言。
    究竟是谁在“提出毫无根据的指责”呢？试问尼赫鲁先生，我们说西藏是中国领土的一部分，西藏问题是中国的内政问题，不容许外国干涉，难道这是无根据的吗？而印度扩张主义分子说：印度和西藏是“母子关系”，西藏问题应由印度参加“解决”，难道这才是有根据的吗？的确，要否认西藏是中国的领土，是需要“拿出很大的想像力，并且不顾明显的事实”。要把我国人民义正词严的驳斥说成是“毫无根据的指责”，而把印度扩张主义者的恶毒攻击说成是“对西藏人民的同情”，也只有那特有的“很大的想像力”和“不顾明显的事实”的人才能作到。
      “冷战的语言”，我们从印度扩张主义的报纸上已经领教得够多了。他们叫嚣“西藏独立”，叫嚣“中国威胁印度的安全”，叫嚣“中国有扩张领土的野心”，如此等等，不一而足。不仅如此，印度扩张主义者从“冷战的语言”进而到“冷战的行动”，他们搞游行，画漫画，扔西红柿侮辱我们国家的领袖像等等。他们嫌冷战还不够，还要进行热战。印度人民同盟总书记就打算派“志愿军”到西藏参加什么“反对中国人的争取自由的斗争”。试问尼赫鲁先生，究竟是谁在使用“冷战的语言”，究竟是谁在进行“冷战”和“热战”？尼赫鲁先生口口声声说要保持中印友好关系，但对所有这些“冷战”和“热战”的语言都熟视无睹，反而“不顾事实的真相与礼节”，把我国人民的正义愤慨和爱国行为说成是“毫无根据的指责”，这是什么逻辑呢？

    是谁“不顾事实真相”？
    印度总理尼赫鲁4月27日在印度人民院讲话中把我国人民对印度扩张主义分子的反击说成什么“不顾事实真相和礼节，使用了冷战的语言”。我们不禁要问，是谁“不顾事实真相”？是谁“不顾礼节”？是谁“使用了冷战的语言”。
    我们还记得，当我国人民日报发表了达赖喇嘛给谭冠三将军的三封信后，印度扩张主义分子说什么这是“捏造”的。人民日报把信件摄成照片发表后，印度扩张主义分子仍不信这个“事实真相”。就是尼赫鲁本人也“不顾事实真相”“表示怀疑”。直到尼赫鲁同达赖会谈后才不得不承认这确实是达赖喇嘛本人写的。从这件事，我们要问，到底是谁“不顾事实真相”。
    我们还记得，西藏叛乱发生后，印度报刊发表了多少诬蔑和谩骂我国的言论，甚至发表了一些侮辱我国人民爱戴的领袖毛主席的漫画，尤其严重的是在印度警察纵容下，在孟买发生了严重侮辱我国领袖的事件。与此相反，我国人民至今仍抑制着自己的无限愤慨的心情，坚持与印度扩张主义分子进行说理斗争。我们要问，到底是谁“不顾礼节”？
    我们还记得，在西藏叛乱事件发生后，印度的一些报刊，一直在叫嚷什么“西藏死亡了”，要求“西藏独立”，甚至要求在印度召开有中国、印度、西藏叛乱分子“三方面”参加的“圆桌会议”来讨论纯粹属于我国内政的“西藏问题”。对这些放肆的言论，印度领导人未采取友好的措施，相反说什么“我们已经把言论自由的尺度放得很宽。”我们要问，是谁“使用了冷战的语言”，是谁“放宽了”“使用冷战语言”的“尺度”。

    “遗憾”与“难过”
    尼赫鲁先生4月27日在人民院就西藏问题所发表的讲话，是一篇对中国人民极不友好的讲话，是无礼指责中国政府的有害言论。
    西藏叛乱前后，印度的一些反动报刊和印度的扩张主义分子大作文章，公开诬蔑我国，干涉我国内政，以致发展到孟买一小撮暴徒公开侮辱我们敬爱的毛主席的画像。对于这些破坏中印友好的言论和行动，尼赫鲁先生在讲话中，一方面表示“遗憾”，一方面又为其辩护，说什么
  “这都不是政治性的”，而只是什么“民族感情”和“一时冲动”等等，同时，尼赫鲁又不顾众所周知的事实，硬说什么，“中国对印度所做的指责如此荒诞”，什么“中国的负责人士对印度所作的评论和指责的语言是冷战的语言”等毫无事实根据的话，并为此感到什么“难过”。其实，真正的“荒诞的指责”，正是尼赫鲁总理的讲话。大家都知道，中国人民以“友谊为贵”，一直克制着自己，希望印度不要干涉中国的内政，希望保持中印友好关系，但是当印度某些报纸和某些人的行为已经超出最善于克制自己的中国人的克制范围的时候，我们为什么不可以反击那些扩张主义分子和野心家呢？我们为什么不可以指出事实的真相呢？难道这就是“荒诞的指责”吗？
    尼赫鲁先生很善于不顾客观事实来对待问题，而这一次，他又居然想“倒打一耙”把印度的错误一古脑推到中国身上，但是事实总是事实！它是不容任何人随意改变和歪曲的。
    尼赫鲁先生这篇不长的讲话中，他否认所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”不真实性，说什么他“愿说清楚，达赖对这项声明和后一个声明完全负责。”这就使人“不太明白”了，为什么别人对某事的“完全负责”，而出于另一个人的口中呢？而这个人恰好是坚持自己与此事无关的那个人。此外，尼赫鲁还否认了“印度对西藏有见不得人的野心”，等等，总之，尼赫鲁的这篇讲话中与他几次的谈话中都有一个共同的特征，即充满了矛盾和十分不客观。
