Xinhua News Agency, 10th: One hundred Tibetan students have recently graduated from the Central Institute for Nationalities. They are about to embark on a journey to build their beloved homeland into a new democratic and socialist Tibet. Teachers and students of more than forty ethnic groups in the institute extended their warmest congratulations to them. The walls of classrooms and dormitory buildings were covered with large-character posters written in various ethnic languages, offering congratulations. Tibetan students who have not yet graduated presented Hadas and red flowers to the graduating students. The institute also held a grand send-off party for them.

These Tibetan students have made great progress in their studies under the care and cultivation of the Communist Party. They entered the institute successively from 1954, studying languages (Tibetan and Chinese) and social sciences. Now their cultural level and political consciousness have significantly improved. Almost every one of them has a history of blood and tears, suffering from the exploitation and oppression of the serf system. A month ago, when the former Tibetan local government and upper-class reactionaries launched a rebellion, they were filled with uncontrollable anger and severely condemned the crimes of the rebels. At that time, they unanimously expressed to the Party: "We are always ready, listening to the call of the motherland." Now that the rebellion in Tibet has been basically quelled, they are confidently preparing to take up their posts in building a new Tibet. In their letter of determination to the Party organization of the institute and all teachers and students, they stated heroically: "We will always be loyal to the Party and loyal to the people of the motherland, and fight to the end against the reactionary feudal serf system! Thoroughly liberate the working people of Tibet and realize a new democratic and socialist Tibet at an early date. Let the red flag forever fly over Mount Qomolangma, and let the source of happiness flow forever like the Yarlung Tsangpo River! Beloved Party! Our mother, please await our victorious news!"

So that a democratic and socialist new Tibet will be realized at an early date. Photo by Xinhua News Agency reporter Du Haizhen.

    把亲爱的故乡建成社会主义乐园
    百名藏族学生将整装回西藏
    新华社10日讯　中央民族学院最近有一百名藏族学生毕业了。他们将要踏上征途，把自己可爱的故乡建设成为民主和社会主义的新西藏。学院里四十多个民族的师生以极大的热忱向他们祝贺。在教室和宿舍大楼的墙壁上，贴满了用各族文字写的祝贺的大字报。还没有毕业的藏族同学，给毕业的同学们献哈达，挂红花。学院还为他们举行了隆重的欢送会。
    这批藏族学生在共产党的关怀与培养下，在学习上已经取得了很大的成绩。他们从1954年先后入院，学习语文（藏文和汉文）、社会科学，现在文化水平和政治觉悟有了显著提高。他们几乎每人过去都有一本受尽农奴制度的剥削与压迫的血泪史。一个月以前，当原西藏地方政府和上层反动分子发动叛乱后，他们就怒不可遏地严厉谴责叛乱分子的罪行。当时，他们一致向党表示：“时刻准备着，听从祖国的召唤。”现在，西藏的叛乱已经基本平息了，他们正满怀信心地准备走上建设新西藏的岗位。他们在给学院的党组织和全院师生的决心书里豪迈地表示：“我们永远地忠实于党、忠实于祖国人民，同反动的封建农奴制度斗争到底！彻底解放西藏的劳动人民，使民主和社会主义的新西藏早日实现。让红旗永远在珠穆朗玛峰上飘扬，让幸福的泉源如雅鲁藏布江一样万古长流！敬爱的党！我们的妈妈，请听候我们胜利的消息吧！”（附图片）
