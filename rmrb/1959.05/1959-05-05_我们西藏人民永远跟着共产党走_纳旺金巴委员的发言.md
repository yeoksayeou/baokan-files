    Chairman, fellow committee members:
    I fully endorse the reports of Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier Li Fuchun, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and Vice Chairman Li Weihan, and I am willing to implement them in my future practical work.
    In the reports and the speeches of other delegates and committee members, I have realized that under the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, all construction undertakings have achieved rapid development in the past few years. These great achievements make us rejoice and inspire us. People of all ethnic groups across the country are closely united to strive for a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in 1959!
    Refuting the so-called "Statement of the Dalai Lama"
    Now, I want to refute a few words about the so-called "Statement of the Dalai Lama":
    First, the so-called statement falsely claims that the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region "has no power," which is a blatant lie. As everyone knows, the Chairman of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region is the Dalai Lama, the Vice Chairman is the Panchen Erdeni, the Secretary-General is Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme, the Deputy Secretary-General is Lhamin Yeshe Tsultrim, and nine out of ten other committee members, directors and deputy directors of the general office, and directors and deputy directors of various departments are Tibetans. Only a few Han cadres represent the Party and the Central People's Government to serve the people of Tibet. Tibet is a part of China and should accept the leadership of the Party and the Central Government like other regions; especially since Tibet is relatively backward in all aspects, it should request the help of the Central Government and the Han people. In particular, many new industries, due to our own lack of modern scientific knowledge, would be impossible to develop on our own without the help of some Han comrades. In fact, there is no "Han people in power" situation at all, which is clear to anyone with a clear head. On the contrary, the extremely reactionary diehards in the dissolved former Tibetan local government clung to their privileges of exploitation and oppression, wanting to forever ride on the backs of the people, refusing to obey the unified leadership of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, and obstructing and sabotaging the Seventeen-Article Agreement and the preparatory work for the Autonomous Region in all aspects for several years, preventing the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region from playing its due role. All responsibility for this should be borne by the former Tibetan local government.
    Second, the claim that Tibet is not part of China and wants independence is also complete daydreaming. Whether Tibet is part of China can be definitely answered by looking at Tibet's original historical materials, stone tablets, plaques, etc. The Golden Urn system for determining the reincarnation of the Dalai Lama and the title of the Dalai Lama, the golden seal, the golden book, and the titles were all granted by successive Chinese emperors, and even noble official positions above the fourth rank were granted by successive emperors and the central government in Beijing. From this, everyone can clearly see that there is no question of independence for Tibet. Except for traitors with ulterior motives, the Tibetan people all know that the unity of the Han and Tibetan nationalities is a close bond that cannot be destroyed, and even the Dalai Lama himself has never expressed any desire for independence. Traitors are daydreaming,妄想分裂Tibet from the motherland, which is completely impossible, and the Tibetan people and the people of the world will not recognize it. For example, at a so-called Pan-Asian conference held in India before liberation, supported by American imperialism and Indian reactionaries, a few Tibetan reactionaries stubbornly pretended to be representatives of an independent country and distributed a map of Tibet; but because it was fundamentally not an independent country, they had to take back the representatives and the map the next day, which foreigners are also very clear about.
    Third, the claim in the so-called statement that the Dalai Lama came to India of his own volition and was not abducted by others is completely shameless slander by the traitors. In his handwritten letter to General Tan Guansan, acting representative of the Central Government in Tibet, on March 11, the Dalai Lama wrote: "Yesterday I decided to go to the military region to see a play, but due to the instigation of a few bad people, the monks and laypeople, not understanding the truth, followed behind and obstructed me, making it impossible to visit, which made me feel ashamed and anxious, and put me in a state of confusion. ... The reactionary bad elements are using the excuse of protecting my safety to carry out activities that harm me. I am trying to quell this. After a few days, when the situation is stable, I will definitely meet with you." And the spirit of the Dalai Lama's letter to General Tan Guansan on March 13, as well as the Dalai Lama's numerous talks with central leaders and those in Tibet since Tibet's peaceful liberation, all these facts clearly show that the Dalai Lama was purely abducted, and he himself has no freedom at all. The Dalai Lama's three handwritten letters to General Tan Guansan are now said to be genuine even by India's Nehru. Doesn't this already prove that the abduction of the Dalai Lama is an ironclad fact?
    Major Crimes of the Tibetan Rebel Forces
    In short, we all see this so-called "Statement of the Dalai Lama" as rumors fabricated by people who falsely use the Dalai Lama's name. In the more than eight years since Tibet's peaceful liberation, under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, the People's Liberation Army and cadres have earnestly implemented the correct policy of respecting the religious beliefs and customs of the Tibetan people, observed and implemented the Seventeen-Article Agreement, and given the utmost care and importance to the upper-level figures headed by the Dalai and Panchen. Especially when the people of the whole country embarked on the socialist road, the reform in Tibet was postponed for six years. Such meticulous special care was given to the upper-level figures in Tibet. But this group of ingrates, colluding with imperialism and Kuomintang reactionaries, carried out a series of criminal activities that undermined the unity of the motherland and harmed the interests of the Tibetan people:
    1. They killed Reting Rinpoche, who ordained the Dalai Lama as a Bhikkhu, Demo Rinpoche of Dingjilin, Geda Rinpoche of Bairi Monastery, and others. They used the silk wrapping of the Great Tibetan Sutra to make trouser strips and broke gold Buddha statues to make rings. Have the People's Liberation Army and cadres ever done such a barbaric thing?
    2. In 1955, when the Dalai Lama and his entourage attended the National People's Congress and passed through Sichuan on their way back to Tibet, the Tibetan upper-level reactionary group instigated lamas and Khampas to rebel. As a result, they engaged in activities betraying the motherland and were therefore subjected to due sanctions. As for the damage to some buildings, they should of course be responsible for it themselves, but the Central Government still showed concern and carried out repairs.
    3. Article 8 of the Seventeen-Article Agreement stipulates that the Tibetan army should be gradually reorganized into the People's Liberation Army, and the existing number should not exceed one thousand. But they violated this point and vigorously expanded the Tibetan army. Article 11 of the Agreement stipulates that the Tibet region will eventually undergo reform. But the Tibetan upper-level reactionary group always tried every means to prevent reform, wanting to keep their barbaric rule unchanged forever.
    4. They forced lamas from the three major monasteries to join the army and issued them weapons to kill people, openly engaging in activities that violate religion.
    5. They forced Tibetan people between the ages of sixteen and sixty to destroy the highway that brought happiness to the Tibetan people.
    6. In 1952, the reactionary leaders Lhalu Tsewang Dorje and Lozang Tashi organized the illegal "People's Conference" to carry out reactionary activities; in 1955, the reactionary leader Alo Chodrak again carried out reactionary activities, undermining the liberation cause of the Tibetan people.
    7. On March 10, 1959, the rebels killed the patriotic figure Sonam Gyatso, injured Deputy Commander Sampo Tsewang Rigzin, and on March 20, launched a full-scale attack on the People's Liberation Army stationed in Lhasa, undermining the unity of the motherland, violating the interests of the Tibetan people, undermining the national defense of the motherland, and tearing up the Seventeen-Article Agreement.
    These crimes are unforgivable. We sincerely thank the People's Liberation Army for the correct measures to completely quell the rebellion. We believe that the remaining rebels will be quickly and completely eliminated, and I myself will do everything in my power to resolutely support and support this. And I am extremely excited that the Tibetan people will henceforth embark on a new life and move towards the bright road of socialism. We Tibetan people will forever follow the Communist Party, turning Tibet from a dark hell on earth into a bright paradise on earth.

### 我们西藏人民永远跟着共产党走  纳旺金巴委员的发言

专栏：

    我们西藏人民永远跟着共产党走
    纳旺金巴委员的发言主席、各位委员：
    我完全拥护周恩来总理、李富春副总理、李先念副总理、彭真副委员长和李维汉副主席的报告，并愿意在今后实际工作中贯彻执行。
    在报告中和其他代表、委员的发言中，我认识到几年来在党和毛主席英明领导下，各项建设事业都得到了飞跃的发展。这些伟大的成绩，使我们欢欣鼓舞。全国各族人民紧密团结在一起，为争取一九五九年更大、更好、更全面的跃进而奋斗！
    批驳所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”
    现在，对所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”，我要批驳几句：
    第一、在这个所谓的声明中造谣说：西藏自治区筹委会“没有什么权力”，这完全是睁着眼睛说瞎话。大家都知道，西藏自治区筹委会的主任委员是达赖喇嘛，副主任委员是班禅额尔德尼，秘书长是阿沛·阿旺晋美，副秘书长是拉敏·益喜楚臣，其他委员和办公厅正副主任，各处的正副处长等十分之九都是藏族，汉族干部只有少数几个，他们代表党和中央人民政府来为西藏人民办事。西藏是中国的，就应当与其他地区一样接受党和中央的领导；尤其是西藏各方面都比较落后，更应当要求中央和汉族人民的帮助。特别是许多新的工业，由于我们自己缺乏现代科学知识，如果没有一些汉族同志来帮助，要自己单独来搞，是根本不可能的。事实上，这里根本不存在“汉人掌权”的情况，这是任何一个头脑清醒的人都看得清楚的。相反的，已解散的原西藏地方政府中极端反动的顽固分子们把自己的剥削压迫特权紧抓住不放，想永远骑在人民头上，不服从西藏自治区筹委会的统一领导，对中央阳奉阴违，对十七条协议和自治区的筹备工作从各方面进行阻挠和破坏，几年来，使西藏自治区筹委会没有起到应起的作用。这一切责任全部应由原西藏地方政府来负。
    第二、说西藏不是中国的一部分而要独立的问题，也完全是在白天说梦话。西藏是不是中国的一部分，只要看一下西藏原有的历史资料、石碑、匾等，就会得出肯定的答案。历来决定达赖喇嘛转世而举行的金瓶抽签制度和达赖喇嘛的称号，金印，金册，封号，都是由历代中国皇帝封赐的，甚至，四品官以上的贵族官位也是由北京中央历代皇帝和中央政府封赐的。从这里面，谁都清楚地看到，西藏根本不存在独立的问题。除了叛国分子们别有用心外，西藏人民都知道汉藏民族的团结是血肉关系，不允许破坏的，就是达赖喇嘛自己也从来未曾表示过要独立的话。叛国分子们白昼做梦，妄想把西藏从祖国分裂出去，这是完全不可能的，藏族人民和世界上的人都不会承认的。比如，解放前在印度召开的一次所谓泛亚洲会议上，第一天在美帝国主义和印度反动派的支持下，几个西藏反动分子也硬着头皮冒充为一个独立国的代表去参加，把西藏地图也附带分发了；但由于根本上不是一个独立国家，因而第二天不得不把代表和地图收回，这个是外国人也非常清楚的。
    第三、在所谓的声明中说达赖喇嘛来印度是自己的意愿而不是别人劫持的问题，完全是叛国分子们的无耻谰言。三月十一日达赖喇嘛在给中央驻藏代理代表谭冠三将军的亲笔信里写到：“昨天我决定去军区看戏，但由于少数坏人的煽动，而僧俗人民不解真象追随其后，进行阻拦，确实无法去访，使我害羞难言，忧虑交加，而处于莫知所措的境地。……反动的坏分子们正在借口保护我的安全而进行着危害我的活动。对此我正设法平息。几天以后，情况安定了，一定同您见面。”以及三月十三日达赖喇嘛给谭冠三将军的信的精神，再就是从西藏获得和平解放以来到现在，达赖喇嘛给中央领导同志和在西藏的屡次谈话，从以上这些事实中，都可以清楚地了解到，达赖喇嘛纯粹是被劫持的，他本人已丝毫没有自由。达赖喇嘛给谭冠三将军的三封亲笔信，现在连印度尼赫鲁也说是真的，这不是已经说明达赖喇嘛被劫持完全是铁的事实吗？
    西藏叛乱分子的重大罪行
    总之，这个所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”，我们都看出是一些假借达赖喇嘛名义的人制造的谣言。西藏获得和平解放迄今八年多来，人民解放军和干部们在党中央和毛主席的正确领导下，认真执行了尊重西藏人民的宗教信仰和风俗习惯的正确政策，遵守和贯彻执行了十七条协议，并对以达赖和班禅为首的上层人物给予最大的爱护和重用。特别是全国人民走上社会主义的道路的时候，西藏改革推迟六年。对西藏的上层人物给了这样无微不至的特殊照顾。但是这一群以怨报恩的叛匪，勾结帝国主义和国民党反动派进行了一系列的破坏祖国统一、危害西藏人民利益的罪恶活动：
    1．杀死了给达赖喇嘛授比丘界的热振活佛、丁吉林的德木活佛、白利寺的格达活佛等。用包大藏经的绸子来做裤条，把金佛像弄碎做戒指。你们的这种野蛮行为，难道解放军和干部们有过这样情况吗？
    2．一九五五年达赖喇嘛等一行出席全国人民代表大会完毕返藏道经四川的时候，西藏上层反动集团指使喇嘛和康巴人进行叛乱。结果，他们进行了背叛祖国的活动，因而也得到了应有的制裁。至于损坏一些建筑物，那当然应当由他们自己负责，而中央还是给予了关怀，进行修复了。
    3．协议十七条的第八条规定，藏军要逐步改编为人民解放军，同时现有数目也不得超过一千名。但他们违背了这一点，大力扩充藏军。协议第十一条规定，西藏地区迟早要进行改革。但是西藏上层反动集团总是千方百计不要改革，想使自己的野蛮统治永世不变。
    4．强迫三大寺的喇嘛入伍，并发给杀人武器，公开进行违背宗教的活动。
  5．强迫十六岁至六十岁的西藏人民破坏为西藏人民带来幸福的汽车公路。
    6．一九五二年反动头子鲁康娃和洛桑札西组织非法的“人民会议”进行反动活动；一九五五年反动头子阿洛曲则又进行反动活动，破坏西藏人民的解放事业。
    7．一九五九年三月十日叛匪杀死爱国分子索朗降措，伤害桑颇·才旺仁增副司令员，并于三月二十日向驻拉萨的人民解放军进行全面进攻，破坏祖国统一，违背西藏人民利益，破坏祖国国防，撕毁十七条协议。
    这些罪恶是不可饶恕的。我们由衷地感谢人民解放军彻底平息叛乱的正确措施。我们相信残余叛匪一定会被迅速地彻底肃清，我自己一定尽一切力量坚决拥护和支持。并且为西藏人民从此走向新生，走向社会主义的光明大道感到无比的兴奋。我们西藏人民永远要跟着共产党走，把西藏从黑暗的人间地狱变为光明的人间乐园。
