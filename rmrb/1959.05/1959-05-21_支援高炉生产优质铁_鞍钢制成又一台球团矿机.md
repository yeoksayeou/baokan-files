Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, May 20th: The second pelletizing machine made by the Pelletizing Ore Workshop of the Sintering General Plant of Anshan Iron and Steel Company was put into production on the 16th of this month. The first pelletizing machine, made on October 1st of last year, has already entered normal production.

The pelletizing machine produces spherical artificial rich ore, which is operated by buttons, and the output is more than five times higher than that of ordinary briquetting machines producing square artificial rich ore. Spherical pellets are of good quality and easy to melt. Ironworkers call it "Qi-regulating pills" and "fine grain for the blast furnace." After Anshan Iron and Steel's No. 2 Blast Furnace used this kind of spherical pellet to make iron, the production level was greatly improved.

In the past, the Pelletizing Ore Workshop of the Sintering General Plant of Anshan Iron and Steel Company could only produce square artificial rich ore, with low output and poor quality. Moreover, the operation required manual handling of heavy ore bricks, and the labor intensity was quite high. Last year, when the workers of this workshop saw that the Chinese Academy of Sciences had proposed the research and manufacture of spherical artificial rich ore in the twelve-year scientific research plan, they were eager to try and break through this cutting-edge technology. Under the leadership of the factory Party organization, the leading cadres, technicians, and workers of the factory and workshop jointly researched, designed, and trial-produced a complete set of pelletizing machines. After thirty-eight trials and modifications, it was finally officially made on October 1st of last year.

Now, the workers of this workshop are continuing to improve the first and second pelletizing machines and are preparing to manufacture the third pelletizing machine.

### 支援高炉生产优质铁  鞍钢制成又一台球团矿机

    支援高炉生产优质铁
    鞍钢制成又一台球团矿机
    新华社鞍山20日电　鞍山钢铁公司烧结总厂团矿车间制成的第二台球团矿机，在本月16日投入生产。去年10月1日制成的第一台球团矿机，已经进入正常生产。
    球团矿机生产球形人造富矿是用电钮操纵，产量比一般方团矿机生产方形人造富矿高五倍多。球形团矿质量好，容易熔化。炼铁工人称它为“顺气丸”、“高炉的细粮”。鞍钢二号高炉用这种球形团矿炼铁以后，生产水平大大提高。
    鞍钢烧结总厂团矿车间过去只能生产方形人造富矿，产量较低，质量也较差，而且操作时需要人工搬取笨重的矿砖，劳动强度相当高。这个车间的职工，去年看到中国科学院在十二年科学研究规划中提出研究制造球形人造富矿，便跃跃欲试，想突破这项尖端技术。在工厂党组织的领导下，厂和车间的领导干部、技术人员和工人共同研究，设计和试制出一整套球团矿机，经过三十八次的试验和修改，终于在去年10月1日正式制成。
    现在，这个车间的职工，正在继续改进第一台和第二台球团矿机，准备制造第三台球团矿机。
