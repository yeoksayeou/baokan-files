Xinhua News Agency, May 11th: Chairman of the Presidium of the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic, Dieckmann, delivered a speech at the enlarged meeting of the NPC Standing Committee. The full text is as follows: Respected Chinese friends and comrades:

　　On behalf of the People's Chamber delegation, I thank Marshal Zhu De for his welcome speech.

　　It is a great pleasure and honor for the delegation of the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic, which is visiting the People's Republic of China, to be able to speak to so many members of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China and the people of the whole country about the current political situation related to our country, especially the German peace treaty issue. It is particularly significant that today, May 11, is the day when the Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference, the first international conference in which two Germanys participate with equal status, opens. The conspiracy of the imperialist countries to oppose our peaceful republic ultimately could not prevent the German Democratic Republic from obtaining its due position in this international negotiation. As we point this out with extreme satisfaction, we are also fully aware that this is not solely due to our efforts. There is no doubt that the great victories our people have achieved in the cause of building socialism in unity, and the brilliant achievements in labor production, have created decisive conditions for the continuous growth of the domestic and international prestige of our worker-peasant state—the first peaceful state in German history. However, the reason we have been able to do all this is because we first received the help and support of the Soviet Union when we began to strive to build a truly democratic and peaceful new Germany, and then quickly received the help and support of other socialist countries and peoples after the founding of the Republic. Today, it is our glorious duty to express our gratitude here, in particular, to the government and people of New China for their immeasurable assistance to our people. Those deplorable European cold war heroes—the unrepentant revanchists and militarists—clearly know what it will mean if the People's Republic of China, the most populous country in the world, and the powerful Soviet Union, together with other socialist countries, stand shoulder to shoulder with the German Democratic Republic against the revival of German militarism in Adenauer's country, against preparing a third world war that would bring unimaginable consequences, against arming the West German army with atomic weapons, and fighting for the establishment of a reunified and democratic German state.

　　After visiting India, Ceylon, and Vietnam, we arrived in Beijing on the evening of April 30. That evening, our beloved Premier Zhou Enlai said the following in his speech to the delegations from more than fifty countries who participated in the "May Day" celebrations, which was a major event for us. He said:

　　"Under the pressure of peace-loving countries and people all over the world, the United States, Britain, and France have now had to accept the Soviet Union's proposal to convene a foreign ministers' conference and a summit conference. We fully support the Soviet Union's proposal and hope that the convening of these conferences will help resolve the conclusion of a German peace treaty, the ending of the occupation regime in West Berlin, and other mature international issues, thereby contributing to the elimination of threats to European security and the easing of international tensions."

　　More than seven hundred guests from Asian, African, and European countries responded to Premier Zhou's incisive speech with warm applause, giving us an extremely strong impression. During our stay here, we can see new and brilliant examples proving that you and we are united every day. We have to thank the beloved Chairman of the People's Republic of China, Comrade Liu Shaoqi, for inviting us during his tenure as Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. At the same time, I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude for the statement in his letter to me personally on March 23 this year. Because this statement is of great significance, please allow me to repeat it here:

　　"On behalf of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China, I once again affirm to you that the Chinese people fully support the Soviet government's proposal of January 10, 1959, to convene a conference to discuss and conclude a German peace treaty. I am deeply convinced that the sacred cause of the German people to achieve the peaceful reunification of their motherland will surely achieve final victory with the universal support of all peace-loving people in the world."

　　This statement, as well as many other statements by the highest people's representative body and the government of the People's Republic of China, proves that the Chinese people have a deep understanding of the German people's struggle for a peaceful resolution of the German question, the conclusion of a German peace treaty, and the formation of a confederation of the two German states. All these statements have received an extremely deep response among all the people in our country.

　　On this day of the opening of the Geneva Conference, I would like to briefly talk to you once again about the basic characteristics of the German Democratic Republic's policy:

　　The primary task of our entire policy is to strive to ensure that all the German people obtain the peace treaty that they have not yet obtained, fourteen years after the end of Hitler's war. No one in the world can deny that the German people have the right, not only morally but also under international law, to demand the signing of a peace treaty. This right was clearly stipulated by the four victorious powers of World War II in the Potsdam Agreement. German militarism brought extremely serious suffering to the people of all countries in the First World War, and especially in the criminal Hitler war. The Soviet people, in particular, paid incalculable sacrifices in this war. The German people themselves also suffered tremendous hardships in this war and after the war. Therefore, after the end of the Hitler war, the German people were presented with a historic task, which was to create conditions so that the heinous German militarism could never rise again, and so that the German people could build a new life of peace and friendship with the people of all countries in the world. The four powers unanimously agreed on this task of our people in Potsdam. They unanimously demanded that fascism, militarism, and imperialism be eradicated in Germany, and that a foundation be established for a democratic and peace-loving Germany. In our part of Germany, that is, the former Soviet occupation zone, today's German Democratic Republic, these demands, whether of the four powers or of our people, have been fully realized. We dealt with war and Nazi criminals, confiscated their property as a result of a referendum, distributed the estates of the Junkers to poor peasants and agricultural workers, turned the industrial enterprises of those monopoly capitalists who were guilty of war crimes into public ownership, and carried out thorough democratic reforms of the education and judicial systems. The separatist politicians of West Germany, in collusion with the three Western powers, undermined the unified German currency system, and in September 1949, under the leadership of Adenauer, established the West German state that split the motherland. In this country, the old imperialist and militarist forces regained power from the very beginning. At this time, we established a peaceful worker-peasant state, and in this new Germany, we have consistently and effectively built socialism. As I have said, everything we have done, both in the past and now, is fully in line with the Potsdam resolutions of the four powers and also fully in line with the will of our people. In contrast, the occupying powers in West Germany abandoned the basis of the Potsdam Agreement as early as 1946, and have increasingly clearly rejected this agreement since then. This violates the will of the West German people and subjects them again to the rule of the decadent old forces—militarists, monopoly capitalists, fascists, and imperialists.

　　Ignoring the peaceful will of the vast majority of the German people is not only extremely unfair, but also constantly and seriously threatens the peace of Germany, Europe, and the world. The majority of the people in all of Germany hope to finally eliminate the abnormal division of the capital Berlin and all of Germany, and hope that Germans can live peacefully and united in the same peaceful and democratic family. The content and goal of the national policy of the German Democratic Republic is to ensure that this will of our people is also implemented in West Germany.

　　The specific implementation of reunification is the most vital matter for the German people themselves. On the other hand, not only the four powers that signed the Potsdam Agreement, but also the people of all countries in the world, especially those who fought against the barbaric regime of Hitler with weapons in hand, also very much hope to permanently eliminate the war center in West Germany in the heart of Europe. To give a number to more clearly illustrate how much danger Bonn's policy poses to peace: The Bonn Republic government spent a huge sum of 2.25 billion marks in March of this year to expand its military! In just one month! And this is still the official figure announced by Bonn.

　　In order to eliminate this serious threat to peace, the Soviet government has proposed that a peace treaty with Germany must now be finally concluded in accordance with the wishes and will of the people of the two Germanys, and that the continuous source of trouble must be eliminated by making West Berlin a demilitarized free city. These proposals have received our full support because they are in line with the interests of our people and help to safeguard world peace. The four foreign ministers and the two German foreign ministers who are meeting in Geneva today have an unshirkable obligation before the conscience of the people of all countries: to create conditions for convening a summit meeting and then convening the largest international conference to conclude a German peace treaty. People all over the world want peace. Therefore, the people of all countries in the world are watching this Geneva Conference. Peace-loving people of all countries will condemn with hatred and contempt those who attempt to disrupt the Geneva Conference.

　　The representatives of the German Democratic Republic are participating in the negotiations at this conference with their heads held high. They know that they represent the cause of goodness and justice, that they can rely on the peaceful will of the vast majority of our people, that they have the wholehearted support of the powerful socialist camp, and that they are also sympathized with by thousands of peace-loving people in the world. The situation of the West German representatives in Geneva is completely different! Three days ago, the spokesman of the Christian Democratic Union parliamentary group in the Federal Parliament in Bonn said: The Bonn government regrets that it has "failed to be backed by a unanimous attitude of all parties" at the upcoming conference. This shows that there are the most serious differences between the parties in the Bonn Republic, especially after the German Social Democratic Party put forward its German plan. The main points of this plan are different from Adenauer's policy. Like the parties in Bonn, the Western countries, which have pushed West Germany onto the destructive path of the Cold War, militarism, and monopolism, are also inconsistent. The serious differences between Britain and Bonn are well known, but there are also deep differences between Paris and London, and between London and Washington. What must be prevented now is that capitalist countries solve these differences at the expense of the interests of us German people.

　　Now the foreign ministers should prepare a peace treaty in Geneva, which is the only realistic way to peacefully resolve the German question, to bring the two Germanys closer together, and to finally reunify Germany. As you know, the German Democratic Republic has proposed the establishment of a German Confederation and the establishment of an All-German Committee. This committee can of course only be composed on an equal footing, because for the sake of peace, our German peace state must never allow the West German reactionary militarist forces to have a majority-winning possibility in such a committee. The task of this committee of the Confederation is to seriously implement the terms of the German peace treaty or to supervise the serious implementation of these terms in the two Germanys. This requires the members of the committee to conduct extensive cooperation in all aspects of public life. The parliaments and governments of the two Germanys will initially still exist, but the joint recommendations of the Confederation Committee will increasingly accelerate the rapprochement of the two parts of Germany. The Confederation Committee is particularly responsible for restoring family relations, economic relations, currency relations, and transportation relations that have been disrupted due to the artificial division of Germany. In this way, free all-German elections can finally be held to elect the German National Assembly.

　　This is the only realistic and peaceful path to the future establishment of a peaceful and democratic German nation state. Before this state is born, all foreign troops must of course withdraw from German territory. As everyone knows, the Soviet Union has for many years proposed the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Germany, and, like us, also supports the Polish government's plan to establish a nuclear-weapon-free zone in Central Europe. We would like to express our deep gratitude to the people of China for supporting all these proposals aimed at realistically resolving the German issue and ensuring world peace—these proposals also include the separate withdrawal of the two Germanys from the North Atlantic Treaty and the Warsaw Treaty.

　　Respected friends and comrades, our sincere wish is to peacefully and beneficially resolve the German issue through the path that I have once again explained here. We recognize that many more and lengthy negotiations are needed to achieve this, but no matter how long the negotiations are, they are a thousand times better than just one day of atomic war. Every citizen of our Republic, like the people of China, understands this truth.

　　Under the leadership of the working class and its party, the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, all parties and all democratic forces in our country have achieved great and consolidated unity, and are committed to defending peace and building socialism. This unity cannot be destroyed by anything or anyone.

　　We fully agree with Marshal Peng Dehuai, Minister of National Defense of your country, on this unity a few days ago when he visited the German Democratic Republic. He said that a solid unity must be established between the working class and its army, so that it can not only rapidly build socialism, but also have a strong force to prevent the invasion of all enemies. We thank Marshal Peng Dehuai for these clear and definite remarks, and we also recall with great gratitude the joint statement issued by the governments of the German Democratic Republic and the People's Republic of China on January 27 this year, which stated: "The government of the People's Republic of China emphasizes and declares that it will regard any attack by imperialist countries on the German Democratic Republic as an attack on the entire socialist camp, and will fully support the German Democratic Republic in repelling such attacks."

　　Please allow me to conclude my speech with the following few words. We are very pleased to be able to discuss the urgent problems of our people, who are suffering from artificial division, with the people's representatives of our great friend, the People's Republic of China, today. On May 1, we stood on the grandstand of Tiananmen Square and saw the grand demonstration for peace in the world, that is, peace for the people of all countries. We are very honored to have cordial and friendly talks with the great leader of your country, Chairman Mao, and his outstanding comrades-in-arms, and talked about the beautiful new life of the Chinese people. Our two peoples will celebrate the tenth anniversary of our national day in the same month of January this year—1959. This unites us more closely. We are watching the new China with admiration. We are the outpost of the socialist world in Germany and Central Europe, and we are confident that together with the Soviet Union, People's China and other socialist countries, our great cause will surely triumph.

　　Long live the Chinese people!

　　Long live Sino-German friendship!

　　Long live the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union!

　　Long live world peace! (Attached picture)

    德国人民和平解决德国问题的斗争必胜
    狄克曼主席在我国人大常委会扩大会议上的演说
    新华社11日讯　德意志民主共和国人民议院主席团主席狄克曼在人大常委会扩大会议上发表演说，全文如下：敬爱的中国朋友们、同志们：
    我代表人民议院代表团，感谢朱德元帅的欢迎词。
    能够在这样多的中华人民共和国全国人民代表大会常务委员会的委员和全国人民代表面前，谈谈与我们祖国有关的目前政治情况，特别是对德和约问题，这对正在中华人民共和国访问的德意志民主共和国人民议院代表团来说，是一种莫大的愉快和荣幸。特别有意义的是，今天，5月11日，正是第一次有两个德国以平等地位参加的国际会议——日内瓦外长会议开幕的一天。帝国主义国家制造的反对我们和平的共和国的阴谋，最终还是不能阻挠德意志民主共和国在这一国际谈判中取得应有的地位。当我们极其满意地指出这一点的时候，我们也完全意识到，这不仅仅是我们的功劳。毫无疑问，我国人民团结一致地在建设社会主义的事业中所获得的巨大胜利，和在劳动生产上所取得的辉煌成就，给我们工农国家——德国历史上第一个和平国家的国内和国际威望的不断增长，创造了决定性的条件。但是，我们所以能够做到这一切，是因为我们在开始努力建设一个真正民主和平的新德国的时候，就首先得到了苏联的帮助和支持，共和国成立以后，又很快地得到了其他社会主义国家和人民的帮助和支持。今天能够在这里特别向新中国的政府和人民对他们所给予我国人民不可估量的援助表示感谢，是我们的光荣义务。那些可悲的欧洲冷战英雄们——怙恶不悛的复仇主义者和军国主义者清楚地知道，如果世界上人口最多的国家中华人民共和国和强大的苏联以及其他的社会主义国家肩并肩地和德意志民主共和国一起，反对在阿登纳的国家里重新复活德国军国主义，反对准备将带来不可设想的后果的第三次世界大战，反对用原子武器武装西德军队，为建立一个重新统一的和民主的德意志国家而斗争，将会意味着什么。
    我们在访问印度、锡兰、越南以后，4月30日傍晚到达北京。当天晚上，敬爱的周恩来总理在他对来自世界五十多个国家参加“五一”观礼的代表团的讲话中说了以下的话，这对我们说来，是一件大事。他说道：
  “在全世界爱好和平的国家和人民的压力下，现在美、英、法三国已经不得不接受苏联关于召开外长会议和政府首脑会议的建议。我们全力支持苏联的建议，并且希望这些会议的召开能够有助于解决缔结对德和约、结束西柏林占领制度以及其他一些成熟了的国际问题，从而对消除欧洲安全的威胁和缓和国际紧张局势作出贡献。”
    来自亚洲、非洲和欧洲国家的七百多位客人对周总理的精辟的讲话报以热烈的掌声，给予了我们极其强烈的印象。我们在这里作客期间，每天都可以看到证明你们和我们团结一致的新的光辉事例。这一点我们得感谢敬爱的中华人民共和国主席刘少奇同志，他在担任全国人民代表大会常务委员会委员长期间邀请了我们。同时，也对他今年3月23日给我个人来信中的声明致以衷心的感谢。由于这一声明具有重大意义，请允许我在这里把它复诵一下：
    “我以中华人民共和国全国人民代表大会常务委员会的名义再次向你肯定，中国人民全力支持苏联政府1959年1月10日提出的关于召开和会讨论并缔结对德和约的建议。我深信，德意志人民争取和平统一自己祖国的神圣事业一定会在全世界一切爱好和平的人民的普遍支持下，取得最后的胜利。”
    这一声明以及中华人民共和国最高人民代表机构和政府的其他许多声明，都证明中国人民对德国人民争取和平解决德国问题、缔结对德和约以及两个德意志国家组成邦联的斗争，有着深刻的了解。所有这一切声明，在我国全体人民中得到了极其深刻的反应。
    在日内瓦会议开始的今天，我想再一次向诸位简短的谈谈德意志民主共和国政策的基本特点：
    我们全部政策的首要任务，是致力于在希特勒战争结束十四年后的今天，使全体德国人民得到至今尚未获得的和约。世界上没有任何人能够否认，德国人民不仅在道义上，而且在国际法上有要求签订和约的权利。这个权利是第二次世界大战的四个战胜国在波茨坦协定中明确规定的。德国军国主义在第一次世界大战中，尤其是在罪恶的希特勒战争中，给世界各国人民带来了极其严重的苦难，特别是苏联人民在这一次战争中付出了无法估计的牺牲。德国人民自己在这次战争中以及战后，也同样经受了极其巨大的苦难。因此，希特勒战争结束以后，就给德国人民提出了一个历史性的任务，那就是创造条件，使万恶的德国军国主义永远不能重新抬头，使德国人民能够建设和世界各国人民和平友好的新生活。四大国在波茨坦一致同意了我国人民的这一任务。他们一致要求，要在德国把法西斯主义、军国主义、帝国主义连根拔掉，为一个民主的爱好和平的德国建立基础。在德国的我们这一部分，那就是过去的苏联占领区、今天的德意志民主共和国，无论是四大国的或是我国人民的这些要求都充分地得到了实现。我们处理了战争和纳粹罪犯，按照公民投票的结果没收了他们的财产，把容克贵族的地产分配给了贫农和农业工人，把那些有战争罪行的垄断资本家的工业企业变为全民所有，对教育事业和司法进行了彻底的民主改革。西德的分裂主义的政客们与西方三国勾结一起，破坏了统一的德国币制，并在1949年9月，在阿登纳的领导下，建立了分裂祖国的西德国家。在这个国家里，旧的帝国主义和军国主义势力一开始就重新掌握了政权。就在这个时候，我们建立了和平的工农国家，在这个新德国中，我们一贯地卓有成效地建设着社会主义。正如我说过的那样，无论过去和现在，我们所做的一切，既完全符合四大国波茨坦决议，也完全符合我国人民的意志。与此相反，德国西部的占领国，早在1946年就已抛弃波茨坦协定的基础，并且以后越来越明显地拒绝这一协定。这样就违背了西德人民的意志，使他们重新遭受腐朽的旧势力——军国主义者、垄断资本家、法西斯分子和帝国主义者的统治。
    无视绝大多数德国人民的和平意志，不仅是非常不公平的，而且也不断地严重地威胁德国、欧洲和世界的和平。全德国大多数人民都希望最后消除首都柏林和全德的反常的分裂现象，希望德国人能够和平团结地生活在同一个和平民主的家庭里。德意志民主共和国的民族政策的内容和目标就是：使我国人民的这种意志也在西德得到贯彻。
    具体实行重新统一是德国人民自己最切身的事情，另一方面，不仅签订波茨坦协定的四大国、而且世界各国人民、首先是那些曾手持武器向希特勒野蛮政权进行斗争的人民，也非常希望永远消除在欧洲中心的西德战争策源地。举一个数字就可以更清楚地说明波恩的政策对和平造成了多大的危险：波恩共和国政府今年3月花了二十二亿五千万马克的巨额款项来扩充军备！仅仅一个月！而且这还是波恩官方公布的数字。
    为了消除这个对和平的严重威胁，苏联政府建议按照两个德国的人民的愿望和意志，现在必须最后缔结对德和约并通过使西柏林成为非军事化的自由城市来消除这一连绵不断的骚扰根源，这些建议获得了我们的全力支持，因为它们符合我国人民的利益并有助于保障世界和平。今天在日内瓦举行会议的四国外长和两个德国的外长，在各国人民的良知面前所负有的义不容辞的义务是：为召开最高级会议和接着召开一次缔结对德和约的最大的国际会议创造条件。全世界人民都要和平。因此，世界各国人民都注视着这次日内瓦会议。爱好和平的各国人民将怀着憎恨和藐视的心情，谴责那些企图破坏日内瓦会议的人们。
    德意志民主共和国的代表昂首阔步地参加这次会议的谈判。他们知道，他们代表着善良和正义的事业，他们可以依靠我国绝大多数人民的和平意志，他们得到强大的社会主义阵营的齐心协力的支持，他们还受到世界各国以千千万万爱好和平的人们的同情。西德代表在日内瓦的情况就完全不同！三天前联邦议院中的基督教民主联盟议会党团发言人在波恩说：波恩政府对于在即将召开的会议上“未能以各政党的一致态度为后盾”感到遗憾。这就表明：波恩共和国各政党之间，特别是在德国社会民主党提出它的德国计划以后，有着最严重的分歧。这个计划的主要各点都不同于阿登纳的政策。和波恩各政党一样，把西德推上冷战、军国主义和垄断主义的毁灭道路的西方国家，也是不一致的。英国和波恩之间的严重分歧是大家都知道的，可是巴黎和伦敦之间以及伦敦和华盛顿之间也存在着深刻的分歧。现在必须防止的就是，资本主义国家用牺牲我们德国人民的利益的办法来解决这些分歧。
    现在外长们应该在日内瓦准备和约，这是和平解决德国问题、两个德国接近和最后重新统一德国的唯一现实道路。你们知道，德意志民主共和国提议建立德意志邦联和设立一个全德委员会。这个委员会当然只能在对等的基础上组成，因为为了和平的利益，我们的德意志和平国家决不能让西德反动军国主义势力在这样一个委员会里有着以多数取胜的可能。邦联的这个委员会的任务是，在两个德国认真地执行对德和约的条款或监督这些条款的认真执行。这就要求委员会的成员在公众生活的各个方面进行广泛的合作。两个德国的议会和政府起初仍将存在，可是邦联委员会的共同建议将日益加速德国两个部分的接近。邦联委员会特别负有恢复由于德国被人为的分裂而破坏的家庭关系、经济关系、币制关系、交通关系等任务。这样下去，最后就可以举行全德自由选举，选出德国国民议会。
    这是将来成立一个和平民主的德意志民族国家的唯一现实的和平道路。在这个国家诞生之前，一切外国军队当然必须撤离德国领土。大家知道，许多年来苏联就已建议从德国撤退一切外国军队，并且同我们一样也支持波兰政府关于建立中欧无原子武器区的计划。伟大的人民中国也支持所有这些旨在现实地解决德国问题和确保世界和平的建议——这些建议也包括两个德国分别退出北大西洋公约和华沙条约——，对此，我们谨向中国人民表示深切的感谢。
    敬爱的朋友们和同志们，我们的衷心愿望是通过我在这里再一次加以阐明的途径来和平地有益地解决德国问题。我们认识到，要实现这一点还需要许多次和长时期的谈判，可是不管多么长期的谈判，总比只进行一天原子战争要好千百倍。我们共和国的每个公民和中国人民一样都了解这一真理。
    在工人阶级和它的政党德国统一社会党的领导下，我国所有政党和所有民主力量，实现了伟大和巩固的团结，致力于保卫和平和建设社会主义。这种团结是任何东西和任何人都破坏不了的。
    在这种团结一致上，我们也完全赞同贵国国防部长彭德怀元帅几天前访问德意志民主共和国时所说的话。他说，工人阶级和它的军队之间必须建立巩固的团结，这样不仅可以迅速地建设社会主义，而且也拥有强大的力量来防止一切敌人的侵犯。我们感谢彭德怀元帅的这些清楚明确的讲话，我们也怀着非常感激的心情回忆德意志民主共和国和中华人民共和国两国政府今年1月27日发表的联合声明，声明中说：“中华人民共和国政府强调声明，它将把帝国主义国家对德意志民主共和国的任何进攻都看作是对整个社会主义阵营的进攻，并且将全力支持德意志民主共和国击退这种进攻。”
    请允许我用下面几句话来结束我的讲话。我们感到十分高兴，今天能够同我国伟大的朋友中华人民共和国的人民代表一起讨论深受人为分裂之苦的我国人民的迫切问题。5月1日，我们站在天安门的大观礼台上，看到了争取人世平安，即世界各国人民和平的盛大示威。我们感到十分荣幸，能够同你们国家人民的伟大领袖毛主席和他的杰出战友进行亲切友好的谈话，谈到了中国人民的美好的新生活。我们两国人民将在今年——1959年同1月份，庆祝国庆十周年。这使我们更紧密地团结在一起。我们满怀着钦佩的心情注视着新中国。我们是社会主义世界在德国和中欧的前哨，我们确信，同苏联、人民中国和其他社会主义国家朋友在一起，我们的伟大事业必定胜利。
    中国人民万岁！
    德中友好万岁！
    以苏联为首的社会主义阵营万岁！
    世界和平万岁！（附图片）
