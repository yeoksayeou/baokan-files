Ma'anshan, May 12th (Our reporters Yu Feng and Chen Chongfa) report: The No. 309 blast furnace of Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Company has recently achieved two highs (high utilization coefficient, high pig iron pass rate) and two lows (low coke ratio, low cost), becoming a red banner among small blast furnaces of eight to twenty-eight cubic meters in Anhui Province. This small blast furnace with a volume of eight cubic meters produced an average of 14.2 tons of pig iron per day in April, with a utilization coefficient of 1.775 and a pig iron pass rate of 100%. The amount of coke consumed per ton of iron was 1.07 tons, and the cost per ton of iron was 179 yuan, 46 fen.

Since the No. 309 blast furnace started operation on November 8 last year, production has been relatively normal; however, the workers were not complacent, but actively learned advanced experience and carried out technical innovations on a large scale. Since February, the production level has improved significantly.

High air volume and high air temperature can have an immediate effect on increasing pig iron production, reducing coke ratio, and improving pig iron quality. The blower motor used by the No. 309 blast furnace is 100＠, and the air volume is 84 cubic meters per minute. In the past, the actual utilized air volume was 20 to 25 cubic meters per minute, and a lot of air was released into the atmosphere. The air temperature was also only maintained at 400 degrees. In February, after learning the advanced experience of full air volume and multi-nozzle combustion in tubular hot blast stoves, they boldly experimented and increased the air volume to 30 to 40 cubic meters per minute; at the same time, they added six combustion nozzles to the hot blast stove. In March, they learned from foreign experience and expanded the diameter of the upper tuyere of the blast furnace from the original 55 mm to 74 mm. The air volume rapidly increased to 50 to 65 cubic meters per minute. The air temperature also rose to 500 to 550 degrees Celsius, reaching a maximum of 750 degrees Celsius. These measures rapidly increased the output of the No. 309 blast furnace, increasing the daily output by more than four tons compared to the original, and the coke ratio also dropped to about one ton.

In terms of raw material management, the No. 309 blast furnace adopted methods such as fixing raw materials, meticulous processing, and feeding "fine grains" into the furnace. The ore and coke used in this blast furnace are all substandard raw materials not used by medium-sized blast furnaces in Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Company. Although the iron content of the ore is above 48%, there is a lot of mud ore and powder ore; the coke is local coke, and there are many low-quality "black head coke" with large ash powder and poor strength. Based on this situation, they put forward the slogan of "making fine food from coarse grains" and formulated a set of raw material management systems. This is: Fixed materials – try to use one kind of ore as much as possible within a certain period of time. The ore is tested and stacked separately according to the level of grade; Meticulous processing – the particle size of raw materials should be as uniform as possible, and they should be fed into the furnace according to particle size grading. At the same time, pay attention to the cleanliness of the raw materials. Coke should not be fed into the furnace without screening, mud ore should not be fed into the furnace without washing, and powder ore should not be fed into the furnace without cleaning; "Fine grains" into the furnace – according to the characteristics of small blast furnaces, coke, ore, limestone, dolomite, etc. are all broken into small pieces and then fed into the furnace in grades. Due to the serious and meticulous raw material management, this small blast furnace has not only never experienced hanging material accidents, but also ensured the continuous improvement of pig iron quality.

The good production situation of the No. 309 blast furnace also lies in their strict implementation of blast furnace operating procedures and the unification of three-shift operations. When this blast furnace was first put into production, the three-shift operations were not consistent enough, which affected the stability of the furnace condition and the improvement of output and quality. In order to unify the three-shift operations and earnestly implement the operating procedures, they insisted on the foreman and group leader meeting and the worker pre-shift and post-shift meeting system. At the meeting, they studied the operating policy based on the furnace conditions and checked the implementation of resolutions. All matters resolved are jointly observed and implemented. If there are any changes in actual operation, the next shift of workers must be informed in detail so that every worker has a clear understanding.

The No. 309 blast furnace is an "experimental field" of the Party Committee of the No. 1 Iron Smelting Plant of Ma'anshan Iron and Steel Company. Party Secretary Wang Tianjiu and others often go deep into the front of the furnace to understand the situation, help solve problems, and educate the workers. A vigorous red flag competition was launched on this furnace. Praise, criticism, and self-criticism are also carried out daily at the shift meetings. The foreman often participates in physical labor, discusses matters with the masses, always deeply understands the workers' ideological situation, and proactively cares about the workers' lives. The employees are often full of energy and enthusiasm.

    马鞍山309号高炉高举优质高产红旗
    生铁质量全部合格
    本报马鞍山12日电  记者于风、陈崇发报道：马鞍山钢铁公司三○九号高炉，最近几个月来做到了两高（利用系数高、生铁合格率高）两低（焦比低、成本低），成为安徽全省八立方公尺到二十八立方公尺小高炉中的一面红旗。这座容积八立方公尺的小高炉，4月份平均日产生铁十四点二吨，利用系数为一点七七五，生铁合格率达到百分之百，每一吨铁所消耗的焦炭数量为一点零七吨，每吨铁的成本是一百七十九元四角六分。
    三○九号高炉从去年11月8日开炉以来，生产一直比较正常；但是职工并没有自满，而是积极学习先进经验，大搞技术革新。2月份以来生产水平又有很大提高。
    大风量、高风温，对于提高生铁产量、降低焦比、提高生铁质量能收立竿见影之效。三○九号高炉使用的鼓风机马达为一百＠，风量是每分钟八十四立方公尺，过去实际被利用的风量是每分钟二十到二十五立方公尺，很多风都放入大气中。风温也只保持在四百度。2月份，他们在学习了鼓足风量和管式热风炉多嘴燃烧的先进经验以后，大胆地进行试验，把风量增加到每分钟三十到四十立方公尺；同时，在热风炉上增加了六个燃烧咀。3月间，他们又学习外地经验，把高炉上风口的直径由原来的五十五公厘扩大为七十四公厘。风量迅速增加到每分钟五十到六十五立方公尺。风温也上升到摄氏五百度到五百五十度，最高达到七百五十度。这些措施使三○九号高炉的产量迅速上升，日产量比原来提高四吨以上，焦比也下降到一吨左右。
    三○九号高炉在原料管理方面，采取了固定原料、精心加工、
  “细粮”入炉等做法。这座高炉用的矿石、焦炭，都是马鞍山钢铁公司中型高炉不用的次等原料。矿石含铁量虽在48％以上，但泥矿、粉矿多；焦炭是土焦，其中又有许多质量低劣的“黑头焦”，灰粉大，强度也差。他们根据这种情况，提出了“粗粮细作”的口号，制定了一套管理原料的制度。这就是：固定用料——在一定时间内尽量使用一种矿石，矿石都经过化验，按品位高低分别堆放；精心加工——原料粒度力求均匀，按粒度分级入炉，同时注意原料清洁，焦炭不筛不入炉，泥矿不洗不入炉，粉石粉末不清不入炉；“细粮”入炉——根据小高炉的特点，把焦炭、矿石、石灰石、白云石等都破碎成小块，然后分级入炉。由于原料管理认真细致，这座小高炉不仅没有发生过挂料事故，还保证生铁质量不断提高。
    三○九号高炉生产情况好，还在于他们严格执行了高炉操作规程和统一了三班作业。这座高炉刚投入生产不久，三班操作不够一致，影响炉况的稳定和产量质量的提高。为了统一三班操作，认真执行操作规程，他们坚持了工长、组长碰头会和工人班前班后会议制度。会上，针对炉况研究操作方针，检查决议执行情况。凡是经过决议的事情，就共同遵守执行。在实际操作中如有变动，必须向下一班职工详细交代，使每个工人都心中有数。
    三○九号高炉是中共马鞍山钢铁公司炼铁一厂委员会的一个“试验田”。党委书记王天九等经常深入炉前了解情况，帮助解决问题，对工人进行教育。这座炉上开展了轰轰烈烈的红旗竞赛。班务会上也天天进行表扬、批评和自我批评。工长经常参加体力劳动，遇事都和群众商量，时时深入了解工人的思想情况，同时主动关心工人的生活。职工经常情绪饱满，干劲十足。
