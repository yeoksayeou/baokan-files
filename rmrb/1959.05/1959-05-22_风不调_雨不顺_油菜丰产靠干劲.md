Adverse Weather, Bumper Rapeseed Harvest Depends on Hard Work
By Our Correspondents Yi Xintian and Zhu Xueyi

May 18th was the first sunny day after a long spell of rain. The members of the Fengchan (bumper harvest) Production Team of the Luqiao Commune in Huangyan County, Zhejiang Province, were overjoyed. The rapeseed they had harvested had been waiting for a sunny day to be dried and sold to the state. At dawn, as soon as the sun rose over the mountains, the members were busy turning over the rapeseed to dry it. In the afternoon, cart after cart of rapeseed was sent to the grain purchasing station. After settling the accounts in the evening, they had sold a total of 19,066 jin of rapeseed that day. So far, they have sold a total of more than 41,690 jin of rapeseed to the state. Based on a planting area of 227 mu, the average per mu yield sold to the state is 184 jin. Including what has been weighed but not yet dried and what is reserved for seeds, the per mu yield of this production team is about 215 jin, while last year's per mu yield was only 76 jin.

How did this rapeseed achieve such a high yield over a large area? "Adverse weather, bumper harvest depends on the commune and hard work," this is the profound experience of the members. From sowing to harvest, the members constantly overcame natural disasters and unremittingly strengthened cultivation and management. In late November last year, after the rapeseed was sown, there was a drought, and the seedlings did not emerge for a long time. What should be done? After research by the Party branch, it called on the members to fight the drought to protect the seedlings. Everyone set up twenty-four waterwheels, pumping water day and night without stopping. Many members slept in the fields, changing shifts at any time. After five days and five nights of crash drought resistance, the rapeseed seedlings came out, each seedling tender green and lovely.

In order to carefully cultivate and manage the rapeseed, the members divided the boundless rapeseed seedlings into more than ten sections and established special management groups. Each group elected experienced farmers as field leaders. The field leaders often "spoke for the fields," putting forward specific opinions on when to fertilize, weed, and what kind of fertilizer to apply, and at the same time inspecting and accepting agricultural work to ensure quality. The field leaders were very conscientious and responsible for the management of the rapeseed fields. Hu Huafu, the field leader of the second team, often went to the fields before dawn to check the growth of the rapeseed; whenever there was wind and rain in the middle of the night, he immediately got up and woke up the members to go to the fields to protect the seedlings. Hu Huafu was therefore praised and rewarded several times.

Adjacent areas growing the same crops is most conducive to carrying out competitions. Each special management group of this rapeseed field formulated short-term plans every ten days as the content of the competition. In the competition, each special management group often checked and compared each other, visited and learned from each other, and no one wanted to fall behind. The second special management group of the second team was slow in progress and poor in quality when sowing. The field leader checked and saw that the situation was not good. He told the members about the situation at dinner. When everyone heard this, without saying a word, some put down their bowls, some did not even wash their feet, and immediately went to till the land and replant, doing a good job overnight. They won the red flag in the competition the next day.

The rapeseed seedlings grew stronger day by day, and suddenly the weather forecast said that a cold wave was coming. How could the strong seedlings be allowed to freeze! More than two hundred members of the entire production team covered the seedlings with grass and soil. In one night, all the rapeseed seedlings were kept warm, and not a single seedling was frozen.

When the rapeseed grew as tall as a person and began to bloom, the members carefully checked and were vigilant against the occurrence of insect pests. One day, the third team found clubroot disease in a field. The pest control team immediately dispatched, spraying all the adjacent rapeseed with Bordeaux mixture (a water solution of copper sulfate and lime) once, and the insect pests were completely wiped out before they spread.

The rapeseed gradually turned yellow. The Party branch organized all the members to visit the fields. The old members stroked their beards and said: I have never seen such good rapeseed in my life! They threw large clods of soil on the seedlings, and more than a dozen in a row did not fall, and everyone smiled triumphantly. "The rapeseed is well planted, but can it be harvested?" In the evening, Yu Pude, the secretary of the Party branch, called on everyone to rush to harvest the rapeseed, and the members proposed to fight hard for three days to ensure a bumper harvest. However, there is dew when harvesting rapeseed in the morning, and the pods will crack when harvesting during the day, which will lead to losses. What should be done? After research, the members decided to get up in the middle of the night to harvest and stop at dawn. In the middle of the night, everyone went to the fields spontaneously. For three consecutive days, more than two hundred mu of rapeseed was all harvested. The members were also busy threshing. If there was not enough time during the day, they continued to work at night with gas lamps. In this way, more than five months of hard work resulted in a bumper harvest.

The high yield of this rapeseed over a large area has enabled many members to overcome conservative ideas and establish the confidence to strive for an even greater harvest next year. Peng Puding, the leader of the second team, originally did not believe that this rapeseed would increase production. He said that the high-yield field would become a low-yield field, and he thought it would be a good thing if the rapeseed seeds could be harvested. Now, he is convinced, he has reserved more seeds and plans to expand the area again during the winter planting.

    风不调　雨不顺  油菜丰产靠干劲
    本报记者　伊心恬　朱学亿
    5月18日，久雨初晴，浙江省黄岩县路桥公社丰产片生产队的社员们高兴极了，他们收割到家的油菜籽，早就等着晴天后晒干卖给国家。清晨，太阳刚出山，社员们就忙着翻晒菜籽。下午，一车又一车的菜籽送到了购粮站。傍晚一结账，这天共卖了菜籽一万九千零六十六斤。到现在总共已经卖了四万一千六百九十多斤菜籽给国家，按照种植面积二百二十七亩计算，平均每亩已卖给国家一百八十四斤。连同秤过还没干的和留种的在内，这个生产队亩产约在二百一十五斤左右，而去年亩产只有七十六斤多。
    这片油菜是怎样取得大面积高产的呢？“风不调，雨不顺，丰收靠公社，靠干劲。”这是社员们的深刻体会。这片油菜从播种到收获，社员们不断战胜自然灾害，始终不懈地加强培育管理。去年11月下旬，这片油菜播种后，适蓬干旱，久不出苗，怎么办呢？党支部研究后，号召社员抗旱保苗，大家架起了二十四部水车，停人不停车地日夜车水；不少社员睡在田头，随时换班。经过五天五夜的突击抗旱，油菜苗出来了，一株株幼苗嫩绿可爱。
    为了精心培育管理，社员们把一望无际的油菜苗划分为十多片，建立了专管小组，每一组推选有经验的农民为田长，田长经常“替田说话”，什么时候施肥、除草，施什么肥，提出具体意见，同时检查和验收农活，保证质量。田长对油菜田管理都很认真负责。二小队田长胡化夫经常天朦朦亮就下田检查油菜生长情况；碰到半夜刮风下雨，他立即起床叫醒社员下田护苗。胡化夫因此几次受到表扬奖励。
    连片的同一作物，最便于开展竞赛。这片油菜各专管组每十天订出小段计划，作为竞赛内容，各专管组在竞赛中经常相互检查对比，相互参观学习，谁也不甘落后。二小队第二专管组播种的时候进度慢，质量差，田长一检查，眼看不妙，吃晚饭时把情况告诉社员。大家一听，二话不说，有的放下饭碗，有的脚也不洗，立即去整地补播，连夜搞好。第二天评比，他们得到了红旗。
    油菜苗日见粗壮，忽然天气预报寒流来了。茁壮的菜苗哪能让它冻坏！全生产队二百多社员，盖草的盖草，壅灰的壅灰，一夜工夫，把所有油菜苗全部保暖，没冻坏一株苗。
    油菜长到一人高，开始开花了，社员们细心检查，警惕着虫害发生。一天，三小队在一丘田里发现了龙头病。治虫专业组立即出动，把连片油菜全部喷射了一次波尔多液（硫酸铜和石灰的水溶液），不等虫害蔓延，就全扑灭了。    油菜逐渐发黄了。党支部组织了全体社员到田间参观。老社员摸着胡子说：活到胡子这么长，没见过这样好油菜！他们把很大的泥块丢在苗子上，接连十多个都落不下，大家得意地笑了。“油菜种是种得好，能不能丰收到家？”晚上，党支部书记于普德号召大家抢收油菜，社员们提出苦战三天，保证丰收到家。但是，早晨割油菜有露水，白天割菜荚会裂开，要损失，怎么办？社员们一研究，决定半夜起床收割，到天亮就停止。到了半夜，大家不约而同地下田了。接连三天，二百多亩菜籽就全部抢收完毕。社员们又忙着脱粒，白天来不及，晚上点起汽灯继续干。就这样，五个多月的辛勤劳动，获得了丰收的结果。
    这片油菜的大面积高产，使很多社员克服了保守思想，树立了明年争取更大丰收的信心。第二小队小队长彭普定本来不相信这片油菜会增产，他说高产片要变成低产片，他认为油菜种子能收回来就算好事。现在，他信服了，他多留了种子，准备冬种时再扩大面积。
