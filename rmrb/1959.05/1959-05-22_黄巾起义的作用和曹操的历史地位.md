The life and activities of Cao Cao cannot be discussed in isolation from the social situation before and after the Yellow Turban Uprising, the enormous historical role of the Yellow Turban Uprising, and his attitude towards the Yellow Turban Army. Many commentaries on Cao Cao have focused on the relationship between Cao Cao and the Yellow Turban Army, leading to some differences of opinion. This article also intends to provide a simple narrative and analysis of this issue from the following aspects.

The situation at the end of the Han Dynasty and the Three Kingdoms: the Yellow Turban Uprising was the basic driving force for social development during this period.

Comrade Guo Moruo once said in his article that Cao Cao deserves affirmation not only because he made many significant contributions to history, but also because, even in his "most disgraceful" act of attacking the Yellow Turban Army, he did not violate the purpose of the Yellow Turban Uprising and continued to complete the cause of the Yellow Turban Uprising. This argument has been strongly opposed by Comrade Yang Bing and some other comrades. In their view, since Cao Cao attacked the Yellow Turbans, he violated the purpose of the Yellow Turban Uprising and could not be said to have continued to complete the cause of the Yellow Turban Uprising. To resolve this dispute, we need to further explore the historical role of the Yellow Turban Uprising and Cao Cao's attitude towards the Yellow Turban Army; and to explore these issues, we must first clarify the social situation before and after the Yellow Turban Uprising.

The Yellow Turban Uprising took place at the end of the Han Dynasty, and there were still many remnants of the Yellow Turban Army active in various places during the Three Kingdoms period. What was the basic situation at the end of the Han Dynasty and the Three Kingdoms before and after the Yellow Turban Uprising? According to the opinion of most historical workers, China's feudal society transitioned from its early Warring States to the Qin and Han dynasties to its middle (Wei, Jin, Southern and Northern Dynasties) stage, and the end of the Han Dynasty and the Three Kingdoms were precisely in this transitional period. During the Han Dynasty, China's feudal society still retained a large number of remnants of the slave system. The main difference between the Eastern Han Dynasty and the Western Han Dynasty was that the number of slaves used in production was not large. As for free small farmers, they were prevalent in both the Western and Eastern Han Dynasties, especially in the Western Han Dynasty. These free small farmers and tenant farmers who paid rent and taxes to the state and cultivated the fields of powerful families, although they did not form a strong personal dependence relationship with the state and feudal landlords, were actually in a very unfree situation. Heavy state corvée and the usury of commercial capital were constantly pressing them, driving them to the brink of bankruptcy and escape; many escaped farmers were later forced to become slaves of wealthy families or gradually attached to powerful landlords, becoming the so-called dependent farmers and guests of the Eastern Han Dynasty. Accompanying these phenomena were production stagnation and market depression. The further development of feudal society required the gradual elimination of the remnants of the slave system, the end of the plight of free small farmers, and their transformation into farmers or serfs with a strong personal dependence relationship under the control of the state or feudal landlords. In this way, although they were not as free as the free small farmers of the Han Dynasty in terms of status, they were relieved of feudal burdens and somewhat freed from the suffering of bankruptcy and escape, and social productive forces were further improved in the context of the improvement of production relations. This change in feudal production relations was already evident in the late Eastern Han Dynasty. According to Xun Yue's "Han Ji," at that time, "powerful families occupied more and more fields, and floating guests paid most of the taxes." The so-called "floating guests" were some farmers who depended on powerful landlords as tenants in order to escape official service. Many emerging aristocratic families gradually formed a complete set of feudal dependent relationships between themselves and their dependent farmers, guests, and tenants in the process of annexing free small farmers. These powerful aristocratic families not only used this to "arbitrarily control the countryside," forming local separatist forces. By the time of the Jin and Southern and Northern Dynasties, the aristocratic families had established a powerful family rule in politics. At that time, whether it was the farmers or serfs under the shelter of the aristocratic families (including the clans, dependent farmers, guests, and tenants controlled by the aristocratic landlords) or the farmers or serfs who were compulsorily registered on the land by the state through means such as the "tuntian" system, "zhan tian" and "jun tian," their personal dependence relationship with the feudal state and feudal landlords was particularly strong.

This transformation was achieved through a long period, especially a series of class struggles at the end of the Han Dynasty and the Three Kingdoms, the most important of which was the great Yellow Turban Uprising. Before the Yellow Turban Uprising, the contradiction between these new and old production relations was reflected in the struggle between the aristocratic landlords and the eunuch clique within the landlord class. It was of certain progressive significance for the aristocratic landlords to oppose the politically greedy and incompetent eunuch clique in order to develop new production relations, although the aristocratic landlords also began to become corrupt at this time. It is rare for the purpose of changing society to be achieved through the internal struggle of the landlord class. The aristocratic landlords and their supporters, the middle and lower-level non-aristocratic landlords, not only failed to defeat the eunuch clique, but also caused the disastrous "Party Prohibition." Under such circumstances, the only, and only, force that could change the society at the end of the Han Dynasty and promote the development of the feudal system was a large-scale peasant war—the Yellow Turban Uprising.

The direct cause of the Yellow Turban Uprising was the further deterioration of the social situation after the "Party Prohibition." The eunuch clique, which controlled the central government, became even more "tyrannical throughout the world, and the people could not bear it." In addition to the eunuch clique, the aristocratic families, powerful landlords, and slave owners also continued to annex and oppress the peasants and persecute and enslave a large number of slaves. The ultimate basis for these reasons was still the backward social foundation that hindered the development of productive forces, so that social production could not be carried out normally, and this backward social foundation had to be transformed with the help of peasant wars.

Due to the limitations of historical conditions, the Yellow Turban Uprising, like many peasant wars in history, could not overthrow the rule of the feudal landlord class and establish a non-exploitative peasant regime. However, as a driving force for social development, the peasant war—the Yellow Turban Uprising—demonstrated its enormous power in improving the old production relations, developing social productive forces, and promoting the further development of the feudal system. This power can be estimated from two aspects.

First, after the Yellow Turban Army's uprising, "official offices were burned everywhere, villages were robbed, prefectures and counties were lost, and most of the chief officials fled. Within ten days, the world responded, and the capital was shaken" ("Book of the Later Han Dynasty, Biography of Huangfu Song"). Their most direct achievement was to overthrow the Han dynasty government on which the eunuch clique relied. More important than this most direct achievement was that the Yellow Turban Uprising destroyed the most backward remnants of the slave system that existed in the old society at the end of the Han Dynasty. The wealthy families and large merchants who owned "thousands of slaves" gradually disappeared due to the fatal blow from the rebel army. The powerful landlords and aristocratic families, who had already gathered clansmen and guests in various places to "arbitrarily control the countryside," took advantage of the collapse of the Han dynasty government to further strengthen the feudal dependent relationship between their dependent farmers, guests, and tenants, either to separate and occupy one side or to seek self-preservation. The divided separatist situation after the Yellow Turban Uprising was a negation of the unified Han dynasty government that preserved the backward social foundation at the end of the Han Dynasty and was an inevitable transitional stage for Cao Cao to unify the north. The basis of this transformation was created by the Yellow Turban Uprising.

Second, during the Yellow Turban Uprising, the domestic class situation was undergoing drastic changes. On the one hand, the Yellow Turban Uprising destroyed the remnants of the slave system that existed in the old society at the end of the Han Dynasty, overthrew the unified Han dynasty government and the eunuch clique, and formed the separatist situation at that time under the contention of aristocratic families and powerful landlords; but on the other hand, it created the necessary new preconditions for the unification that appeared in the north and the whole country. This is because, although the aristocratic families and powerful landlords representing the separatist forces in various places developed their feudal economic power during the division, they were also subjected to various different blows during the Yellow Turban Uprising, especially the aristocratic landlords suffered the greatest blows. Only a few aristocratic landlords with relatively solid foundations, such as Yuan Shao, were able to expand their power and occupy one side after the Yellow Turban Uprising. This enabled some middle and lower-level non-aristocratic landlords, who were not only suppressed by the eunuch clique at the end of the Han Dynasty but also by the aristocratic landlords, to take the opportunity to rise and support Cao Cao in establishing a unified Wei regime in the north. This situation reflects a characteristic in the development of China's feudal system, that is, when the feudal system entered the Wei, Jin, Southern and Northern Dynasties, when the aristocratic families and powerful landlords expanded and strengthened their feudal dependent relationship with farmers or serfs through annexation, the autocratic state power always existed, and was still quite strong in the Cao Wei dynasty. The aristocratic families and powerful landlords established their powerful family rule in the Jin dynasty, greatly weakening the power and role of the autocratic state, but in the Southern and Northern Dynasties, the autocratic state power developed again with the support of the poor families or commoner families, and non-aristocratic landlords. The autocratic state power demanded the creation of a unified situation and restricted the arbitrary arrogance and separation of the aristocratic families and powerful landlords, in order to facilitate the further development of the feudal economy. The Yellow Turban Uprising opened up a path for the higher development of the Chinese feudal system that entered the Wei, Jin, Southern and Northern Dynasties.

After analyzing the situation at the end of the Han Dynasty and the Three Kingdoms and the enormous historical role of the Yellow Turban Uprising, we need to look back at how Cao Cao behaved in a series of events before and after the Yellow Turban Uprising, so as to determine Cao Cao's historical status.

The purpose of the Yellow Turban Army's uprising and Cao Cao's attitude towards the Yellow Turban Army

In the series of events from the end of the Han Dynasty to the Three Kingdoms, Cao Cao's political attitude changed somewhat before and after, and this change was deeply related to the Yellow Turban Uprising. Before the Yellow Turban Uprising in the first year of Zhongping of Emperor Ling of Han, Cao Cao, who came from an eunuch family, witnessed the corruption and darkness of the eunuch clique at that time, so he broke off relations with the eunuch clique and turned to rely on the aristocratic landlord Yuan Shao and others to oppose the eunuchs. This was the beginning of Cao Cao's progressive activities in his life, although these activities did not exceed the purpose of stabilizing the feudal regime through reform. However, after the Yellow Turban Uprising, when the peasant army threatened the entire landlord class, Cao Cao immediately joined the eunuchs and aristocratic celebrities to suppress the Yellow Turban Army. This must be said to be reactionary. After the failure of the Yellow Turban Uprising, the domestic situation underwent great changes. Based on the objective situation created by the Yellow Turban Uprising, Cao Cao initially opposed Dong Zhuo, and later opposed Yuan Shao and others, representatives of aristocratic celebrities, representing the middle and lower-level non-aristocratic landlords, and established an autocratic state power in the north that could still control a considerable number of peasants at that time. This progressive path that he was developing day by day was completely paved by the Yellow Turban Uprising.

The period before the Yellow Turban Uprising, when Cao Cao petitioned against eunuchs and other activities, had a certain progressive significance, which is almost universally recognized. As for Cao Cao's various activities and performances during the Yellow Turban Uprising and for a considerable period after the failure of the Yellow Turban Uprising, these are what we need to continue to explore and discuss. The discussion in this section mainly focuses on Cao Cao's attack on the Yellow Turban Army during the Yellow Turban Uprising, and Cao Cao's attack, surrender, and reorganization of the Qingzhou Yellow Turban Army after the failure of the Yellow Turban Uprising.

Comrade Guo Moruo correctly pointed out in his article that Cao Cao's attack on the Yellow Turbans was a "disgraceful thing." However, he also said that Cao Cao's actions "did not violate the purpose of the Yellow Turban Uprising," and by "organizing" the remnants of the Yellow Turban Army after the defeat, Cao Cao continued to complete the cause of the Yellow Turban Uprising. Because the subsequent arguments have been opposed by Comrade Yang Bing and some other comrades, they can be used as the starting point for our analysis of these issues.

Here, the first question to be solved is: what exactly is the purpose of the Yellow Turban Uprising and its cause? According to some historical records, we know that the purpose of the Yellow Turban Uprising was to directly overthrow the rule of the feudal landlord class of the Han Dynasty and establish a peasant regime of their own. The "Biography of Huangfu Song" in the "Book of the Later Han Dynasty" has a passage about the Yellow Turban Army's attempt to seize the political power of the Han Dynasty by force, indicating that Zhang Jiao and others organized hundreds of thousands of believers, including "people from eight prefectures," over a period of more than ten years, put forward the slogan "The Azure Heaven (referring to the Han Dynasty - author's note) is dead, the Yellow Heaven should stand," and decided to launch an uprising simultaneously inside and outside Chang'an on a certain day of a certain month. The purpose was obviously to overthrow the corrupt Han Dynasty rule and establish a revolutionary regime headed by Zhang Jiao. Comrade Guo Moruo's view in his article that the purpose of the Yellow Turban Uprising was only "to want food, to want land, to want to live" underestimates the significance of this national peasant war.

The basic question of revolution is the question of political power. If Zhang Jiao and others had succeeded in the uprising at that time, what kind of regime representing the interests of the peasants would they have established? What kind of social system would they have implemented? Zhang Jiao's Taiping Taoism ("Note to the Biography of Zhang Lu in the Records of the Three Kingdoms" quoted from "Dian Lue") teachings came from the Taiping Jing or the Taiping Qingling Shu ("Biography of Xiang Kai in the Book of the Later Han Dynasty"); Judging from the surviving remnants of the Taiping Jing preserved in the Taoist scriptures, the political thought of this primitive Taoism practiced by Zhang Jiao and others was basically a small-peasant egalitarianism. Volume 67 of the Taiping Jing states:

"Wealth is the harmony of heaven and earth, and all things are used to nourish people. This family only encounters a place to gather, like a mouse in a warehouse, often eating alone, this millet in the big warehouse is not exclusive to the mouse. The money and wealth that is less in it is not exclusive to give to one person. Those who are insufficient should all take from it. Fools are ignorant, thinking that they will always have it exclusively, but they do not know that it is the consignment of ten thousand corpses, and all should get clothing and food from it. Love it and turn it into anger and joy, unwilling to use strength to relieve the poor and rescue the urgent, so that ten thousand families are cut off, no planting in the spring, and no harvest in the autumn. Their grievances are all calling to heaven, and heaven is moved by it, and the earth is moved by it. Not helping gentlemen to relieve the poor and rescue the urgent is great unkindness between heaven and earth. Everyone can be asked to worship and sacrifice, but they are not given, and the gods hate it."

In addition to sharing wealth, the Taiping Jing also advocates that the strong should be used, the old should be cared for, and opposes the abuse of women. As for how to achieve this political ideal? The Taiping Jing proposes to achieve the purpose of equal distribution from top to bottom in the form of relief. Volume 67 of the Taiping Jing states:

"If a husband has a family that raises gold, silver, and treasures, and has more than a hundred million kinds of wealth, accumulating and decaying like mud, if the virtuous and wise use it to give to poor families, they are happy to be famous for benevolence and just helping the earth to nourish the body, and helping the emperors to save the good and cautious people. A family of hundreds of millions can help ten thousand households, giving out the old and receiving the new, without the heart of rapid profit, virtue touches the heavens and the earth, and is heard in distant places, and one can still get new things and remove the decayed mud. Among them, the great virtuous ones daily present their merits to the emperors, and the small virtuous ones daily raise them in the villages, among them, the great fools only repay two or three out of ten, how can they make people very poor?"

In feudal society, it is of course a fantasy to achieve the purpose of sharing wealth by means of relief. At that time, the Five Dou Rice Taoism, which was very close to Zhang Jiao's Taiping Taoism, had Zhang Lu try a social policy and political system in Hanzhong of "righteous huts," "righteous rice and meat," "those who violate the law will be forgiven three times, and then they will be executed," "no long officials are set up, and all are governed by priests." Because Hanzhong was in a relatively special situation at this time, this set of methods had temporarily achieved some results. However, they could not be promoted to all parts of the country after all, nor could they exist for a long time; when Cao Cao advanced into Hanzhong, this set of facilities was immediately destroyed like a flash in the pan. The political system of sharing wealth and sharing use was always an unrealizable ideal in the context of the productive level at that time and the class opposition between landlords and peasants.

Therefore, the purpose of the Yellow Turban Uprising, whether it is said to seize political power or to use seizing political power as a means to achieve the political ideal of sharing wealth and sharing use, was not and could not be achieved. This explains why peasant wars in history all have a tragic nature.

As for the cause of the Yellow Turban Uprising, it is not completely the same as the purpose of the Yellow Turban Uprising. The purpose of the Yellow Turban Uprising is only a subjective wish, while the cause of the Yellow Turban Uprising should be regarded as all the objective effects caused by the Yellow Turban Army in order to realize this purpose. Part of the objective effects of the uprising are consistent with the subjective purpose of the Yellow Turban Army, such as seizing political power by force, and this part of the effect is a failure; while another more important effect is that the Yellow Turban Army destroyed the old social foundation in the process of seizing political power by force, and greatly developed the feudal system. This effect was unexpected by the Yellow Turban Army, at least not something that the Yellow Turban Army could clearly realize in advance. It is not the same as the original purpose of the Yellow Turban Army, because the Yellow Turban Army subjectively did not hold an uprising in order to have one part of the landlords replace another part of the landlords.

Cao Cao, during the Yellow Turban Uprising and when there were still many remnants of the Yellow Turban Army active in various places after the failure of the Yellow Turban Uprising, had attacked the Yellow Turban Army several times. Did he violate the aforementioned purpose of the Yellow Turban Uprising? It should be admitted that Comrade Yang Bing's opposition to Comrade Guo Moruo's view that Cao Cao did not violate the purpose of the Yellow Turban Uprising is correct. When the Yellow Turban Army first revolted, Cao Cao "was appointed as a Cavalry Commandant to attack the rebels in Yingchuan (Yellow Turban Army)." Is it possible that Cao Cao, standing on the position of the landlord class, also participated in the bloody crime of massacring the Yellow Turban Army in order to realize the purpose of the Yellow Turban Army to overthrow feudal rule? After the failure of the Yellow Turban Uprising, Cao Cao continued to attack the Yellow Turban Army several times, the most important of which was the attack, surrender, and reorganization of the Qingzhou Yellow Turban Army. Did he violate the purpose of the Yellow Turban Army this time? It should also be said that he did violate it. This is because this Yellow Turban Army still believed in "the Han Dynasty is exhausted, and the Yellow Family should stand" at this time, and "the soldiers were all elite and brave," not "a mob." Cao Cao also initially suffered a defeat, which made "the whole army afraid"; if Cao Cao had not exhausted all means to defeat them and leave them with no way out, this Yellow Turban Army, which was fighting and retreating, would not have surrendered to Cao Cao and accepted reorganization. After the reorganization, the Qingzhou soldiers, as Comrade Yang Bing said, immediately "changed from a peasant army to a feudal army."

Of course, Cao Cao attacked the Yellow Turban Army several times, and the situations before and after were different, and the roles they played should also be distinguished. When Cao Cao attacked the Yellow Turban Army in Yingchuan, the main contradiction in the country was the life-and-death class struggle between the peasants and the landlord class. The more thorough the peasant war was, the more it could destroy the old social foundation, the more it could promote social development, and the more it would benefit the people. At this time, Cao Cao stood on the position of the feudal landlord class and suppressed the Yellow Turban Uprising, which was obviously a crime that violated the interests of the people. After the failure of the Yellow Turban Uprising, the social situation and class situation completely changed. The feudal system was developing forward on the objective foundation created by the Yellow Turban Uprising through a tortuous path from division to unification. The main contradiction in society was the struggle between various strata and groups within the landlord class, which revolved around inheriting the results of the Yellow Turban Uprising, eliminating division, and completing unification in order to promote the further development of the feudal system. At this time, the remnant Yellow Turban Army not only did not have the power to reorganize and overthrow the rule of the feudal landlord class, but also lost the enormous historical role of changing society in the past. It was at this time that part of the Yellow Turban Army showed signs of wavering and deterioration under the siege of the landlord army (the Qingzhou Yellow Turban Army did not waver or deteriorate before being attacked and surrendered by Cao Cao). Cao Cao attacked, surrendered, and reorganized the Qingzhou Yellow Turban Army, and used them for the work of unifying the north and restoring production, which was needed for the social development at that time. This matter, on the one hand, violated the purpose of the Yellow Turban Army to overthrow feudal rule, but on the other hand, had positive significance for the development of the feudal economy. We cannot simply regard this matter as a serious mistake by Cao Cao.

We have affirmed Cao Cao's activities against the eunuchs before the Yellow Turban Uprising, negated his actions in suppressing the Yellow Turbans during the Yellow Turban Uprising, and made some explanations about his several attacks on the remnant Yellow Turban Army in various places after the failure of the Yellow Turban Uprising. What remains is Cao Cao's activities after the failure of the Yellow Turban Uprising. And this period is the most important period for Cao Cao, and should be used as the basis for our comment on Cao Cao's historical status, because Cao Cao's several important activities during this period, whether from the role they played in history or from the length of time they lasted, are incomparable to the previous two periods.

Cao Cao inherited the results of the Yellow Turban Uprising and completed the great cause of the Yellow Turban Uprising in transforming the society at the end of the Han Dynasty and promoting the development of the feudal system.

When describing Cao Cao's several important activities after the failure of the Yellow Turban Uprising, we should first affirm Comrade Guo's view that Cao Cao continued to complete the cause of the Yellow Turban Uprising, although Comrade Guo has not developed it in connection with the actual situation of the society at that time. We agree with this view because, as mentioned above, the cause of the Yellow Turban Uprising, the main and effective one in real life, was that it transformed the society at the end of the Han Dynasty and promoted the development of the feudal system, and Cao Cao continued to complete such a cause.

Why was Cao Cao, the representative of the feudal landlord class, able to inherit the achievements of the Yellow Turban Army, which opposed the feudal landlord class, and complete the cause of the Yellow Turban Uprising? The reason is:

First, the landlord class also contains contradictions between different strata. Among them, the most reactionary strata, such as the eunuch clique, tried to preserve the backward social foundation at the end of the Han Dynasty and hinder the development of the feudal system, while the more progressive strata, such as the aristocratic landlords and the middle and lower-level non-aristocratic landlords, demanded to break the backward social foundation at the end of the Han Dynasty, eliminate the eunuch clique, and establish a state power or implement the rule of aristocratic families on a new social foundation. This demand basically conformed to the objective situation created by the Yellow Turban Uprising. Because their stratum interests were consistent with the direction of feudal system development at this time, the representatives among them could propose some new political measures and policies of social reform in order to promote the development of this feudal system. Comparing the aristocratic landlords with the non-aristocratic landlords, the former annexed and acted arbitrarily, and had a greater contradiction with the peasants, while the latter opposed arbitrary annexation and advocated making certain concessions to the peasants. Therefore, the non-aristocratic landlords were more in line with the requirements of feudal economic development during this period, and could inherit and complete the achievements and cause of the Yellow Turban Uprising, although this stratum also had a fundamental class contradiction with the peasants. Cao Cao was the representative of the non-aristocratic landlords.

Second, the achievements and cause of the Yellow Turban Uprising in transforming the society at the end of the Han Dynasty and promoting the development of the feudal system could not only be inherited and completed through the progressive stratum in the landlord class represented by Cao Cao, but could only be completed through them. This is because, after the failure of the Yellow Turban Uprising, the peasant army did not have political power and could not use their own hands to establish a set of systems to consolidate and develop the achievements and cause of the uprising. The peasant army could only use the consistency between the interests of the progressive stratum in the landlord class and their above-mentioned cause of the uprising, and consolidate the achievements of the Yellow Turban Uprising from all aspects and continue to complete the cause of the Yellow Turban Uprising through the representatives of this stratum, Cao Cao, etc.

Cao Cao's ability to inherit and complete the achievements and cause of the Yellow Turban Uprising shows that in the complex class struggle at the end of the Han Dynasty and the Three Kingdoms, there was a major contradictory aspect between the peasants and Cao Cao as the feudal landlord class, but under certain conditions of destroying the old social foundation and developing the feudal system, there was a profound influence of the Yellow Turban Army on Cao Cao and a mutual connection and dependence between the two. Comrade Yang Bing said in his article: "The Yellow Turban and other peasant revolutionary armies are the revolutionary faction that promotes historical development, and Cao Cao and other feudal rulers are the reactionary faction that hinders historical development." This argument simply and one-sidedly emphasizes the mutual opposition between the Yellow Turban and other peasant armies and feudal rulers such as Cao Cao, but does not see the place where "under certain conditions," the two "mutually penetrate, mutually communicate, mutually depend, and mutually connect" (Chairman Mao: "On Contradiction"). This argument erroneously and completely denies any progressive role of feudal rulers such as Cao Cao in history. Originally, social history is advancing on a very contradictory and tortuous path. Taking the relationship between the Yellow Turban Army and Cao Cao as an example, Cao Cao attacked the Yellow Turban Army, but the Yellow Turban Army paved the way for Cao Cao to rise in the Central Plains and unify the north; Cao Cao violated the purpose of the Yellow Turban Uprising, but he may have continued to complete the cause of the Yellow Turban Uprising in transforming the society at the end of the Han Dynasty and promoting the feudal system. However, Comrade Yang Bing tried to simply reduce this complex, contradictory, and tortuous social phenomenon to a one-time equation.

Next, let's talk about how Cao Cao inherited the achievements and cause of the Yellow Turban Uprising. The historical role of the Yellow Turban Uprising includes two aspects, which have been analyzed in the previous section, and will not be repeated here. Cao Cao also inherited and completed the achievements and cause of the Yellow Turban Uprising from these two aspects.

First aspect. Cao Cao established the Wei regime on the basis of the Yellow Turban Uprising. This regime no longer restored the situation in the Han dynasty where a large number of official and private slaves were used in production or non-productive labor. Only those who rebelled and committed crimes were still tattooed and made slaves. The Han dynasty government often rewarded meritorious families with many slaves, while Cao Cao's regime rewarded them with guests instead of slaves (see "Biography of Wang Xun, Concubine of the Jin Dynasty"). During the Three Kingdoms, the status of guests was higher than that of slaves, and lower than that of free peasants, which was a kind of person similar to serfs. Guests were slightly better than slaves after all. More importantly, Cao Cao used methods such as "tuntian" to transform a large number of self-cultivating small farmers and soldiers into "tian bing" or "tuntian ke" under the control of the state. The land rent of "tuntian ke" seemed to have increased a lot compared to the land rent of "one out of thirty" in the Han dynasty, but "tuntian ke" were exempted from the harsh corvée and usury of the free small farmers in the Han dynasty, and exempted them from the loss of livelihood due to bankruptcy and escape. The exploitation rate of the "tuntian" system was actually lower than that of the Han dynasty. Cao Cao strengthened the personal dependent relationship of the "tuntian ke," but improved and stabilized their lives, so there was the result that "since the implementation, the people have been at peace." Of course, there were also phenomena such as "the people were not happy and many escaped" in some areas, but on the whole, this measure was beneficial to the "tuntian ke" themselves and to the country's enrichment of military resources. The Cao Wei regime has always defaulted on the feudal dependent relationship that is developing and strengthening between the "bu qu" and "ke" controlled by the powerful landlords and the powerful landlords, although the Cao Wei regime still requires them to perform corvée. This situation shows that the Cao Wei regime did inherit and complete the achievements and cause of the Yellow Turban Uprising, gradually eliminated the large number of remnants of the slave system that were preserved in the feudal society in the past, and transformed countless free small farmers into farmers and serfs with a stronger feudal dependent relationship under the control of the state or feudal landlords, and promoted the development of the feudal system.

Second aspect. According to the social situation and class situation after the Yellow Turban Uprising, Cao Cao completed the unification of the north and established an autocratic state power in the process of developing the feudal system. This regime was based on the "tuntian ke" and self-cultivating small farmers controlled by the state, representing the interests of the middle and lower-level non-aristocratic landlords. Because the north achieved unification, the long-term division and separatist situation that damaged production came to an end. During the division and war, "the people wanted peace, even hanging upside down" ("Records of the Three Kingdoms, Biography of Yuan Huan"), and now the people can live and work in peace and engage in the work of restoring and developing production. Under the unified situation, the state concentrated manpower and material resources, and it was possible to carry out some large-scale water conservancy projects. Unification also enabled the country to have a relatively strong military force to defend against the southward invasion of the northern minorities, the Wuhuan and Xianbei. The work carried out simultaneously with the unification of the north was that Cao Cao implemented a policy of attacking the powerful and restricting annexation. The aristocratic families and powerful landlords at that time showed some negative factors in the process of strengthening feudalization. For example, in the four prefectures of Ji and Bing under the rule of Yuan Shao, "the powerful acted arbitrarily, relatives annexed, the lower people were poor and weak, and they paid rent and taxes on behalf of others. It was not enough to sell family property to meet the orders." When Jingzhou was just taken down by Cao Cao, the local aristocratic families and powerful landlords "mostly did not obey the law, and Liu Jie, the chief secretary of the prefecture, was from an old and powerful family, with more than a thousand guests, who went out to be bandits and disturbed the administration of officials when they entered." This situation was not only unfavorable to unification, becoming a source of power for the aristocratic families and powerful landlords to separate and occupy the locality, but also hindered the restoration of production and was not conducive to the development of the feudal economy. After Cao Cao pacified Yuan Shao, he immediately issued an order to suppress annexation and reduced the feudal burden on the peasants under Yuan Shao's rule. When Sima Zhi was sent by Cao Cao to Jingzhou as a battalion commander, he immediately punished Liu Jie and restored the social order at that time. Cao Cao's policy of attacking the powerful and restricting annexation, to a certain extent, stopped these negative factors and played a positive role in the development of the feudal system in the north. On this basis, the Western Jin established by the Sima clan further completed the unification of the country.

The Sima clan, represented by the Sima clan, established the powerful family rule in the Western Jin Dynasty, completely changing the nature of the Cao Wei regime, which represented the non-aristocratic landlords, but the promoting role of the Cao Wei regime, especially in the era of Cao Cao, in the development of the feudal society at that time, should be fully affirmed.

Simple conclusion

From the relationship between the Yellow Turban Army and Cao Cao, we can not only see the enormous role of the Yellow Turban Uprising in promoting the development of feudal society and its influence on Cao Cao, Cao Cao's historical status and contribution, but also better understand the history of the end of the Han Dynasty and the Three Kingdoms. At that time, without the national peasant war of the Yellow Turban Uprising, Cao Cao, who was "not known as a man of the cliffs," would not have left behind some "heroic" deeds worthy of affirmation. Conversely, without some of Cao Cao's "heroic" deeds, this mighty Yellow Turban Uprising would still have produced great objective effects, but this effect would be diminished because it could not be better consolidated, and the role of the Yellow Turban Uprising would definitely be reduced. The feudal system, no matter what, was going to undergo a stage change at this time, but the pace of its progress might be more tortuous and slow. Of course, this does not mean that without Cao Cao at that time, there would be no one else to replace him; but judging from the actual situation at this time, those who could contend with Cao Cao and replace Cao Cao were only Yuan Shao and Liu Bei, and it can be asserted that these few people, if they replaced Cao Cao's position, would not be as good as Cao Cao. Cao Cao's personal role is precisely that he represented the more progressive stratum of the landlord class at that time, and under the principle of not violating the fundamental interests of the landlord class, he brilliantly completed the consolidation of the achievements of the Yellow Turban Uprising and further promoted the development of the feudal system.

Some people attempt to negate Cao Cao's historical status by using the fact that Cao Cao suppressed the Yellow Turbans, which is obviously very inappropriate. This is because, in the series of events from the end of the Han Dynasty to the Three Kingdoms, Cao Cao basically consistently stood on the side of the progressive stratum in the landlord class. Suppressing the Yellow Turbans, although it was his "disgraceful" stain and crime, reflected his landlord class nature and the class limitations of all his activities, but after the failure of the Yellow Turban Uprising, he was able to consolidate and complete the achievements and cause of the Yellow Turban Uprising, which played a great progressive role. Moreover, when Cao Cao attacked the Yellow Turban Army in Yingchuan, he was only a partial general, an accomplice, and did not play a decisive role in the overall situation at all, while after the failure of the Yellow Turban Uprising, if it was not Cao Cao who continued to complete the cause of the Yellow Turban Uprising in transforming the society at the end of the Han Dynasty and promoting the feudal system, unifying the north and restoring production in the north, the whole situation would have changed. Therefore, the progressive role played by Cao Cao in history is the main one, and the reactionary activity of suppressing the Yellow Turbans is the secondary one. We should affirm Cao Cao's historical status based on his main

    黄巾起义的作用和曹操的历史地位
    袁良义
    曹操的一生活动，是不能离开黄巾起义前后的社会形势，黄巾起义的巨大历史作用，以及他对黄巾军的态度等问题来谈的。许多评论曹操的文章，都曾着重地论及曹操与黄巾军的关系问题，并且产生了若干意见上的分歧。本文也打算从以下几方面，对这个问题作一些简单的叙述和分析。
    汉末和三国的形势，黄巾起义是这一时期推进社会发展的基本动力
    郭老在文章中曾这样说：曹操之所以值得肯定，不仅是因为他在历史上有许多重大的贡献，而且是因为就以他那件“最不光彩”的攻打黄巾军的事情来说，他虽然打了黄巾，但是他并没有违背黄巾起义的目的，并且继续完成了黄巾起义的事业。这种论点引起了杨柄同志和其他一些同志强烈的反对。在他们看来，曹操既打了黄巾，那就违背了黄巾起义的目的，也就谈不上继续完成了黄巾起义的事业。为了解决这种争端，我们有必要进一步去探讨黄巾起义在历史上的作用和曹操对待黄巾军的态度；而探讨这些问题，又必须首先弄清黄巾起义前后的社会形势。
    黄巾起义是汉末的事情，三国时各地还有很多残余的黄巾军在活动。什么是黄巾起义前后汉末和三国的基本形势呢？根据目前多数历史工作者的意见，中国封建社会从它的早期战国到秦汉阶段过渡到中期（魏晋南北朝）阶段，汉末和三国正处在过渡时期。在两汉时代，中国封建社会里还保存着大量的奴隶制的残余。东汉不同于西汉的地方主要是奴婢用于生产上的人数已经不多。至于自由小农，在西汉和东汉都是普遍存在的，西汉时尤多。这些向国家交纳租赋和耕种豪民之田的自由小农和佃农，虽然与国家和封建地主没有结成很强的人身依附关系，而在实际上他们的处境却是很不自由的。繁重的国家差役和商业资本的高利贷剥削无时无刻不在追逼着他们，使他们濒于破产和逃亡；很多逃亡农民，后来不是被迫当了豪势之家的奴隶，就是逐渐依附于豪强地主，成为东汉时的所谓部曲和客。随这些现象而来的是生产停滞，市井萧条。封建社会的进一步向前发展，要求逐步排除奴隶制的残余，结束自由小农的狼狈困苦的境遇，把他们转化为国家或封建地主控制下具有较强的人身依附关系的农民或农奴。这样，他们在身分上虽然没有像汉代自由小农那样自由，但是他们却减轻了封建负担和多少免除了破产和逃亡之苦，社会生产力也就在生产关系得到改进情况下进一步提高起来。这种封建生产关系的变化在东汉后期已现端倪。据荀悦汉纪所载，当时“豪强占田逾多，浮客输大半之赋”。所谓“浮客”就是一些为逃避官役而依附豪强地主作佃的农民。许多新兴的世家大族在兼并自由小农过程中，逐渐形成了他们与其部曲、宾客和佃农之间的一整套的封建依附关系。这些豪强大族不仅以此“武断乡曲”，形成地方割据势力。到了两晋南北朝时期，世家大族在政治上建立了门阀统治，当时无论是荫附于大族下面的农民或农奴（包括大族地主控制下的宗族、部曲、宾客和佃农），还是被国家在屯田制后用占田和均田等方式带有强制性的编制在土地上的农民或农奴，他们与封建国家和封建地主的人身依附关系都格外强固了。
    这种转变是通过一个很长时期，特别是汉末和三国的一系列的阶级斗争来实现的，其中最主要的是黄巾大起义。在黄巾起义以前，这种新旧的生产关系的矛盾曾反映在地主阶级内部的世族地主和宦官集团的斗争中。世族地主为了发展新的生产关系而反对政治上贪暴无能的宦官集团，这是具有一定的进步意义的，虽然世族地主这时也开始腐化。由地主阶级内部斗争来达到变革社会的目的是很少能成功的。世族地主及其支持者中下层非世族地主不仅没有能战胜宦官集团，反而造成了损失惨重的“党锢之祸”。在这种情况下，真正能变革汉末社会，推进封建制度发展的只有是，也只能是大规模的农民战争——黄巾起义。
    引起黄巾起义的直接原因是“党锢之祸”以后，社会情况更加恶化。掌握中央政权的宦官集团益发“虐遍天下，民不堪命”。在宦官集团以外的世家大族、豪强地主和奴主自然也是一样地在继续兼并和压榨农民，迫害和奴役大量的奴婢。而这些原因的最后根据仍然是落后的社会基础阻碍了生产力的发展，以致使社会生产不能正常进行，这种落后的社会基础必须借助于农民战争来加以变革。
    由于历史条件的限制，黄巾起义和历史上许多次农民战争一样，都不可能推翻封建地主阶级的统治，建立一个无剥削的农民政权。但是，作为社会发展的动力的农民战争——黄巾起义，在改进旧有的生产关系，发展社会生产力，推动封建制度进一步发展上，却显示了它的巨大威力。这种威力可以从两方面去估计。
    第一，黄巾军起义以后，“所在燔烧官府，劫略聚邑，州郡失据，长吏多逃亡，旬日之间，天下响应，京师震动”（后汉书皇甫嵩传）。他们最直接的成果是搞垮了宦官集团所依据的汉朝政府。比这种最直接的成果更重要的是黄巾起义摧毁了存在于汉末旧社会中的最落后的奴隶制的残余。拥有“奴婢千群”的豪贵之家和大商贾因遭到起义军的致命打击而逐渐消失了。原来就在各地聚结宗族和宾客以“武断乡曲”的豪强地主和世家大族，乘汉朝政府宣告垮台之际，或为割据一方，或为图谋自保，就进一步加强了部曲、宾客和佃农对自己的封建依附关系。黄巾起义后出现的分裂割据局面是对保存汉末落后的社会基础的统一的汉朝政府的一种否定，是曹操统一北方的必然过渡阶段。这种变革的基础是黄巾起义造成的。
    第二，在黄巾起义时，国内的阶级状况处在剧烈变化之中。黄巾起义一方面摧毁了汉末存在于旧社会中的奴隶制的残余，打垮了统一的汉朝政府和宦官集团，在世族豪强的纷争下，形成了当时的分裂局面；但是另一方面，它又为出现在北方和全国的统一创立了必要的新的前提条件。这是因为，当时代表各地割据势力的世家大族和豪强地主虽在分裂之际发展了自己的封建经济力量，但他们在黄巾起义时也受到各种不同的打击，其中特别是世族地主所受打击最大，只有一部分基础比较雄厚的世族地主如袁绍等能在黄巾起义后扩大自己的势力，专据一方。这就使一些在汉末不仅受宦官集团压抑，同时受世族地主压抑的中下层非世族地主能乘机而起，拥戴曹操在北方建立一个统一的魏政权。这种情况反映了中国封建制度发展中的一种特点，就是在封建制度进入魏晋南北朝时期，当世族豪强通过兼并来扩大和加强自己与农民或农奴之间的封建依附关系时，专制主义国家政权始终是存在的，在曹魏时还相当强。世族豪强在两晋时建立了自己的门阀统治，大大削弱了专制主义国家的权力和作用，但在南北朝时期，专制主义国家政权又在寒族或庶族，非世族地主的支持之下发展起来了。专制主义国家政权要求造成一个统一的局面，并限制世族豪强的任意擅恣和割据，以利于封建经济的进一步发展。黄巾起义为进入魏晋南北朝的中国封建制度更高的发展开辟了道路。
    在分析了汉末、三国的形势和黄巾起义的巨大历史作用之后，我们就需要回过头来，看看曹操在黄巾起义前后的一系列事变中是怎样表现的，从而论定曹操的历史地位。
    黄巾军起义的目的和曹操对待黄巾军的态度
    在汉末到三国一系列的事变中，曹操的政治态度前后是有所变化的，而这种变化与黄巾起义有深刻关联。在汉灵帝中平元年黄巾起义以前，出身于宦官家庭的曹操，目击当时宦官集团的昏暴和黑暗，因而断绝了与宦官集团的关系，转而依附于世族地主袁绍等以反对宦官。这是曹操一生中进步活动的开始，虽然这些活动并没有逾越通过改革来稳定封建政权的目的。但是，黄巾起义以后，当农民军威胁整个地主阶级时，曹操就立刻与宦官和世族名士一道去镇压黄巾军。这件事必须说是反动的。黄巾起义失败以后，国内形势发生很大变化。曹操根据黄巾起义造成的客观情况，最初反对董卓，后来反对世族名士的代表袁绍等，代表中下层非世族地主，建立了一个在当时的北方还能控制相当数量的农民的专制主义国家政权。他这条一天天在发展着的进步道路完全是黄巾起义铺平的。
    黄巾起义前的一段时期，曹操上书反对宦官等活动具有一定的进步意义，几乎是大家所共认的。至于黄巾起义时期和黄巾起义失败以后相当长的时期内，曹操的各种活动和表现，却是我们需要继续加以探究和讨论的。这一节的讨论主要集中在曹操在黄巾起义时期攻打黄巾军以及黄巾起义失败曹操击降和改编青州等黄巾军的问题上。
    郭老在文章中正确地指出：曹操打黄巾是一件“不光彩的事情”。但是，他又说曹操这样做“并不违背黄巾起义的目的”，并且通过把失败后残余的黄巾军加以“组织化”，曹操还继续完成了黄巾起义的事业。由于后面的一些论点遭到杨柄同志和其他一些同志的反对，它们正好可以作为我们分析这些问题的起点。
    在这里，首先要解决的问题是：黄巾起义的目的和它的事业究竟是什么？根据一些历史记载，我们知道黄巾起义的目的，是要直接推翻汉朝的封建地主阶级的统治，建立农民自己的政权。后汉书皇甫嵩传有一段关于黄巾军企图武装夺取汉朝政权的记载，说明汉末张角等在十余年间，组织了包括“八州之人”的几十万信徒，提出“苍天（指汉室——作者注）已死，黄天当立”的口号，并且决定在某月某日于长安内外同时起义。其目的很明显地是要推翻腐朽的汉朝统治，建立以张角为首的革命政权。郭老在文章中认为黄巾起义的目的只是“要粮食，要土地，要活下去”，未免低估了这一次全国性的农民战争的意义。
    革命的基本问题是政权问题。如果当时张角等起义成功，他们会建立怎样一个代表农民利益的政权呢？实施怎样一种社会制度呢？张角的太平道（三国志张鲁传注引典略）教义是从太平经或太平清领书（后汉书襄楷传）里来的；现从道藏中保存的残本太平经看来，张角等奉行的这种原始道教的政治思想基本上是一种小农的平均主义思想。太平经卷六十七中说：
    “财物乃天地中和，所有以共养人也。此家但遇得其聚处，比若仓中之鼠，常独足食，此大仓之粟本非独鼠有也。少内之钱财本非独以给一人也。其不足者悉当从其取也。愚人无知，以为终古独当有之，不知乃万尸之委输，皆当得衣食于是也。爱之反常怒喜，不肯力以周穷救急，令使万家之绝，春无以种，秋无以收。其冤结悉仰呼天，天为之感，地为之动。不助君子周穷救急，为天地之间大不仁。人人可求以祭祀，尚不给与，百神恶之”。
    在共财之外，太平经还主张壮有所用，老有所养，以及反对虐待妇女等。至于如何实现这种政治理想呢？太平经提出从上而下以周济形式来达到平均分配的目的，太平经六十七卷中说：
    “夫人畜金银珍物多财之家或亿万种以上，畜积腐涂，如贤知以行施予贫家，乐名仁而已助地养形，助帝王存良谨之民，夫亿万之家可周万户，予陈收新，毋疾利之心，德洽天地，闻于远方，尚可得常新物而腐涂者除去也。其中大贤者乃日奏上其功于帝王，其中小贤日举之于乡里，其中大愚人不偿报恩者十有两三耳，安能使人大贫哉”。
    在封建社会里，用周济办法来达到共财的目的，当然是空想。当时与张角的太平教很接近的五斗米道，在汉中曾由张鲁试用了一种“义舍”，“义米肉”，“犯法者三原，然后乃行刑”，“不置长吏，皆以祭酒为治”的社会政策和政治制度。由于这时汉中处在比较特殊情况下，这一套办法曾暂时取得一定的成效。但是，它们究竟无法推广到全国各地，也不能长期存在；等到曹操进兵汉中以后，这一套设施立刻就像昙花一现地被破坏了。共财共用的政治制度在当时的生产水平和地主与农民的阶级对立情况下始终是一种无法实现的理想。
    因此，黄巾起义的目的，无论是说它是夺取政权，还是说它是用夺取政权为手段来实现共财共用的政治理想，都是没有和不可能达到的。这说明历史上的农民战争为什么都带有悲剧性质。
    至于黄巾起义的事业，它就与黄巾起义的目的不完全一样了。黄巾起义的目的只是一种主观愿望，而黄巾起义的事业则应看作是黄巾军为实现这种目的所造成的全部客观效果。起义的全部客观效果中有一部分是与黄巾军的主观目的相一致的，如武装夺取政权等，这一部分效果是失败的；而另外一部分更重要的效果是黄巾军在武装夺取政权过程中，摧毁了旧有的社会基础，大大发展了封建制度，这种效果是黄巾军始料所不及，至少不是黄巾军事先能清楚地意识到的，它与黄巾军原来的目的并不相同，因为黄巾军在主观上决不是为了使一部分地主代替另一部分地主而举行起义的。
    曹操在黄巾起义时期和黄巾起义失败以后各地还有很多残余的黄巾军在活动的时际，是曾几次攻打过黄巾军，他有没有违背上述黄巾起义的目的呢？应该承认，杨柄同志反对郭沫若同志关于曹操并没有违背黄巾起义的目的的看法是正确的。在黄巾军刚起义时，曹操“拜骑都尉，讨颍川贼（黄巾军）”。难道站在地主阶级立场的曹操在参加屠杀黄巾军的血腥罪行时，也是为了实现黄巾军推翻封建统治的目的吗？黄巾起义失败以后，曹操还继续攻打过几次黄巾军，其中最重要的一次是击降和改编青州黄巾军一事，这一次他有没有违背黄巾军的目的呢？应该说也是违背的。这是因为，这一支黄巾军在这时还是相信“汉行已尽，黄家当立”的，而且“兵皆精悍”，并非“乌合之众”。曹操最初也还打了败仗，弄得“举军皆惧”；不是后来曹操用尽办法把他们打得走头无路，这一支且战且走的黄巾军是不会投降曹操和接受改编的。改编后的青州兵，正如杨柄同志所说的，一下就“从农民军变成封建军”了。
    当然，曹操几次攻打黄巾军，前后情况是有所不同的，所起的作用也应加区别。当曹操进攻颍川黄巾军时，国内的主要矛盾是农民与地主阶级之间你死我活的阶级斗争。农民战争进行得愈彻底，就愈能摧毁旧有的社会基础，愈能推进社会发展，对人民也愈加有利。这时曹操站在封建地主阶级立场，镇压黄巾起义，显然是违反人民利益的一项罪状。黄巾起义失败以后，社会形势和阶级状况完全变化，封建制度正在黄巾起义造成的客观基础上通过从分裂到统一的曲折道路向前发展，社会的主要矛盾是围绕着承受黄巾起义的成果，消灭分裂和完成统一以促进封建制度向前发展等问题所展开的地主阶级内部各个阶层和各个集团之间的斗争。各地残余的黄巾军这时不仅没有重整旗鼓去推翻封建地主阶级统治的力量，而且也失去了过去变革社会的巨大历史作用。正是在这个时候，黄巾军在地主武装的围攻之下，才有一部分发生动摇和变质的现象（青州黄巾军在被曹操击降之前并没有动摇和变质）。曹操击降和改编了青州黄巾军，把他们用之于适应当时社会发展需要的统一北方和恢复生产等工作，这件事一方面固然违背了黄巾军推翻封建统治的目的，而另一方面却有发展封建经济的积极意义。我们不能笼统地把这件事也看作是曹操的一项严重的罪过。
    我们肯定了曹操在黄巾起义以前反对宦官的活动，否定了他在黄巾起义时期镇压黄巾的行径，对于他在黄巾起义失败后几次攻打各地残余的黄巾军的情况也作了若干说明，剩下的就是黄巾起义失败后曹操的若干活动了。而这一个时期，对于曹操来说，是最主要的时期，应该作为我们评论曹操的历史地位的基础，因为这段时期里曹操的若干重要活动无论是从它们在历史上所起的作用还是从它们历时的长久来看，都是前两个时期所不能相比的。
    曹操承受了黄巾起义的成果，完成了黄巾起义变革汉末社会、推进封建制度发展的巨大事业
    在述说曹操在黄巾起义失败后的若干重要活动时，我们应该首先肯定郭老关于曹操继续完成了黄巾起义的事业的看法，虽然郭老在文章里还没有联系当时社会的实际情况把它加以发挥。我们同意这种看法是因为，黄巾起义的事业如上所述，主要的并在实际生活中起作用的是它变革了汉末的社会，推进了封建制度的发展，而曹操正是继续完成了这样一种事业。
    为什么封建地主阶级的代表人物曹操能够承受反对封建地主阶级的黄巾军的成果，完成黄巾起义的事业呢？其原因是：
    第一，地主阶级内部也包含不同阶层之间的矛盾。其中有最反动的阶层如宦官集团等是力图保存汉末落后的社会基础，阻挠封建制度的发展的，而比较进步的阶层如世族地主和中下层非世族地主却要求打破汉末落后的社会基础，铲除宦官集团，在新的社会基础上建立国家政权或实行世族门阀统治。这种要求基本上是符合于黄巾起义所造成的客观形势的。由于它们的阶层利益与这时封建制度发展的方向相一致，它们中间的代表人物就有可能为促进这种封建制度的发展而提出若干新的政治措施和社会改革的政策来。再将世族地主与非世族地主比较一下，前者任意兼并擅恣，与农民的矛盾较大，而后者却反对任意兼并擅恣，主张对农民作一定程度的让步，因此，非世族地主也就更能符合这一时期封建经济发展的要求，能够承受和完成黄巾起义的成果和事业，虽然这个阶层与农民也存在着根本性质的阶级矛盾。曹操就是非世族地主的代表人物。
    第二，黄巾起义变革汉末社会，推进封建制度的成果和事业，不仅能够通过以曹操为代表的地主阶级中进步阶层来承受和完成，而且也只有通过他们去完成。这是因为，黄巾起义失败以后，农民军没有政权，不能用自己的手来建立一套制度，去巩固和发展起义的成果和事业。农民军只能利用地主阶级中进步阶层的利益与自己上述起义事业的一致性，通过这一个阶层的代表人物曹操等，从各方面用制度把黄巾起义的成果巩固下来，继续完成黄巾起义的事业。
    曹操能够承受和完成黄巾起义的成果和事业，说明在汉末和三国复杂的阶级斗争中，农民与作为封建地主阶级的曹操之间有主要的对立的一面，而在摧毁旧有的社会基础，发展封建制度的一定条件下，却又存在着黄巾军对曹操的深刻影响和两者相互联系相互依赖的一面。杨柄同志在文章中说：“黄巾等农民革命军是推动历史发展的革命派，曹操等封建统治者是阻碍历史发展的反动派”。这种论点只简单片面地强调黄巾等农民军与曹操等封建统治者的相互对立的一面，而看不到“因一定条件”，两者“互相渗透、互相贯通、互相依赖、互相联结”（毛主席：“矛盾论”）的地方。这种论点错误地全盘否定了曹操等封建统治者在历史上的任何进步作用。本来社会历史是在非常矛盾和曲折的道路上前进的。以黄巾军和曹操的关系而论，曹操攻打了黄巾军，而黄巾军却反而为曹操崛起中原和统一北方开辟了道路；曹操违背了黄巾起义的目的，而他却有可能继续完成黄巾起义变革汉末社会，推进封建制度的事业。但是，杨柄同志却企图把这种复杂、矛盾和曲折的社会现象简单地还原为一次方程式。
    下面我们再谈一下曹操是怎样承受了黄巾起义的成果和事业的。黄巾起义的历史作用包含着两方面，前一节已加分析，这里不再重复。曹操承受和完成黄巾起义的成果和事业也是从这两方面进行的。
    第一方面。曹操在黄巾起义的基础上建立了魏政权，这一个政权不再恢复汉代在生产上或非生产性劳动中使用大量的官私奴婢情况，只有一些谋反犯罪的人仍被黥面为奴。汉朝政府经常赏赐勋贵之家很多的奴婢，而曹操政权赏赐时则以客代奴（见晋书外戚王恂传）。三国时客的身分高于奴婢，低于自由农民，是一种类似农奴性质的人。客比奴婢毕竟略胜一筹。更重要的是曹操利用屯田等办法把大量的自耕小农和兵士转化为国家控制下的田兵或屯田客。屯田客的田租比起汉代“三十税一”的田租似乎增加了很多，但是屯田客免除了汉代自由小农所担负的苛繁差役和高利贷的剥削，免除了他们因破产而逃亡失据。屯田制的剥削率实际上还是比汉代为低。曹操加强了屯田客的人身依附关系，但是改善和安定了他们的生活，因此才有“施行以来，众心安之”的结果。自然在某些地区也还出现过“民不乐，多逃亡”的现象，但是就总的情况来说，这种措施于屯田客本身于国家充实军资都是有利的。对于豪强地主控制下的部曲和客，曹魏政权虽然仍要他们服差役，但是他们与豪强地主之间正在发展和强化的封建依附关系，曹魏政权是一向默认的。这种情况说明：曹魏政权的确承受和完成了黄巾起义的成果和事业，逐步排除了过去在封建社会中保存的大量奴隶制残余，并把无数自由小农转化为国家或封建地主控制下成为具有较强的封建依附关系的农民和农奴，促进了封建制度的发展。
    第二方面。曹操根据黄巾起义后的社会形势和阶级状况，在发展封建制度的过程中，完成了北方的统一，建立了一个专制主义的国家政权。这个政权是以国家控制的屯田客和自耕小农为基础，代表中下层非世族地主的利益的。北方由于实现了统一，破坏生产的长期分裂割据局面就宣告结束。在分裂混战之际，“民之欲安，甚至倒悬”（三国志魏志袁涣传），现在人民可以安居乐业，进行恢复和发展生产工作。在统一的局面下，国家集中了人力物力，就有可能举办一些大规模的水利工程事业。统一还能使国家拥有比较雄厚的军力，去防御北方少数民族乌丸和鲜卑等南下侵扰。与统一北方同时进行的工作是：曹操实行了打击豪强，限制兼并的政策。当时的世族豪强在加强封建化的过程中表现了一些消极因素。例如，袁绍统治下的冀并四州，“豪强擅恣，亲戚兼并，下民贫弱，代出租赋，衒鬻家财不足应命”。荆州刚被曹操打下时，当地的世族豪强“多不奉法，郡主簿刘节旧族豪侠，宾客千余家，出为盗贼，入乱吏治”。这种情况不仅不利于统一，成为世族豪强割据地方的力量的来源，而且妨碍生产的恢复，不利于封建经济的发展。曹操平袁绍后，立刻就下了一道抑制兼并令，并减轻了在袁绍统治下农民的封建负担。司马芝被曹操派到荆州做营长，他也立刻惩处了刘节，恢复了当时的社会秩序。曹操这种打击豪强，限制兼并的政策，在一定程度上是制止了这些消极因素，对北方封建制度的发展起了积极作用的。在这个基础上，司马氏建立的西晋才进一步完成了全国的统一。
    以司马氏为代表的世族豪强在西晋时建立了门阀统治，完全改变代表非世族地主的曹魏政权的性质，但是曹魏政权，特别是在曹操时代，对当时封建社会的发展所起的促进作用是完全应该肯定的。
    简单的结论
    从黄巾军与曹操的关系里，我们不仅可以看出黄巾起义推进封建社会发展的巨大作用及其对曹操的影响，曹操的历史地位和贡献，而且能够更好地去理解汉末和三国这一段历史。当时如果没有黄巾起义这一场全国性的农民战争，那末一个“本非岩穴知名之士”的曹操，是不会留下那样一些值得肯定的“英雄”事迹的。反过来，如果没有曹操的一些“英雄”事迹，那末这一场轰轰烈烈的黄巾大起义虽然仍会产生很大的客观效果，但是这种效果就会因得不到较好的巩固而为之减色，黄巾起义的作用一定会缩小。封建制度在这时不管怎样都是要发生阶段性的变化的，但它前进的步伐就可能要曲折和缓慢一些。自然这不是说，当时没有曹操，便不会有别人来代替他；但是从这时的实际情况来看，能够与曹操抗衡和代替曹操的不过袁绍和刘备数人而已，而这几个人如果代替曹操的位置可以断言是比不上曹操的。曹操个人的作用正表现他代表当时地主阶级比较进步的阶层，在不违反地主阶级的根本利益的原则下，出色地完成了巩固黄巾起义的成果，进一步地推动了封建制度的发展。
    有人企图用曹操镇压黄巾一事来否定他的历史地位，这显然是很不妥当的。这是因为，从汉末到三国一系列的事变中，曹操基本上是一贯地站在地主阶级中的进步阶层方面的。镇压黄巾虽然是其“不光彩”的污点和罪状，反映了他的地主阶级本质和他一切活动的阶级局限性，但是他在黄巾起义失败以后，能够巩固和完成黄巾起义的成果和事业，是起了很大的进步作用的。并且，曹操打颍川黄巾军时，不过是一名偏将，一名帮凶，对全局完全不起决定作用，而黄巾起义失败以后，如果不是曹操在那里继续完成黄巾起义变革汉末社会，推进封建制度的事业，统一了北方和恢复了北方的生产，整个局面就会改观。因此，曹操在历史上所起的进步作用是主要的，而镇压黄巾的反动活动是次要的。我们应该根据他的主要活动来肯定曹操的历史地位。
