Comrades Deputies:

    First of all, I wholeheartedly support and congratulate Liu Shaoqi on being elected Chairman of the People's Republic of China, Song Qingling and Dong Biwu on being elected Vice Chairmen of the People's Republic of China, Zhu De on being elected Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Lin Boqu and 16 others on being elected Vice Chairmen, Zhou Enlai on being approved as Premier of the State Council, and the election of other leaders of state organs. After listening to the reports of Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, I felt very excited and filled with strength. I fully support the reports of all the leaders and am willing to strive for their thorough realization.

    The establishment of the People's Commune and the development of various undertakings are the happiness that the Party and Chairman Mao have brought to our minority nationalities.

    I am an ordinary farmer from the Jiefang (Liberation) People's Commune in Wupal District, Shufu County, Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, in the remote western frontier of the motherland. In our area, as in other parts of the country, we can see the new atmosphere of our great motherland becoming richer and stronger day by day. Since liberation, we have clearly known from our own personal experience that the Communist Party and Chairman Mao are the saviors of our minority nationalities. If we always follow the Party and Chairman Mao, we will always be happy. Last autumn, the Party Central Committee issued the "Resolution on the Establishment of People's Communes in Rural Areas," and Chairman Mao pointed out that "the People's Commune is good," which just revealed our long-thought-out idea. Therefore, we immediately responded warmly to the call of the Party and Chairman Mao and merged seventeen advanced agricultural cooperatives into one people's commune. All our farmers celebrated this great victory with great joy. As soon as the People's Commune was established, it showed its unparalleled superiority. The People's Commune implemented free meals, which our ancestors had never dreamed of. From then on, we no longer worried about eating, and only focused on boosting our energy and engaging in production in a big way. The People's Commune implemented "four modernizations," liberating a large number of female laborers, and women participated directly in production just like men. After the establishment of the People's Commune, the centralized and unified use of funds, the unified allocation of labor, the unified planning of land and water conservancy, and the rational arrangement of various productions showed that it was both large and public. All of this promoted the great leap forward in production. During the autumn harvest and autumn planting movement in 1958, we achieved "no idlers in every household, men and women, young and old, all going into battle." All the commune members were full of fighting spirit, high-spirited, and energetic. They worked hard day and night, so they completed the autumn harvest task one month ahead of schedule, and at the same time greatly reduced the phenomenon of throwing away and wasting. In the early and advanced agricultural cooperatives, although we worked very hard, we could only achieve about 40% of the autumn plowing every year, and the depth was only a little more than 10 centimeters. It was different in 1958. All the land that should have been plowed in autumn was plowed in the autumn, and the depth reached 20 to 30 centimeters. The vigorous momentum of the preparatory plowing and spring plowing movement launched last winter and this spring in conjunction with the rectification of the People's Commune was incomparable to any previous year. This laid the foundation for a greater agricultural harvest this year. It should also be specially mentioned here that at the same time as last year's "three autumns" movement, our commune also responded to the Party's call and extracted one-third of the strong labor force to participate in the mass steelmaking movement, refining 700 tons of iron, exceeding the task by 583%. In addition, since the establishment of the commune, we have also established 17 various small factories, seven amateur cultural and artistic troupes, and every team has a literacy class. Agricultural schools and technical schools are being planned, and the high tide of the cultural and technological revolution has begun to form.

    After last year's hard work, our commune reaped a bumper harvest. Taking the brigade (former advanced cooperative) I led as an example: the total grain output increased by 70% compared with 1957, and the total income in 1958 increased by 85% compared with 1957. At the same time, sideline production was carried out, and the sideline income reached more than 8,000 yuan. The total agricultural and sideline income of the whole team increased by 17,500 yuan compared with 1957, so 96% of the commune members increased their income.

    We cherish our achievements very much. The members of our commune cherish their people's commune like the pupils of their eyes. They actively participated in the work of rectifying and improving the people's commune. At present, our commune has overcome the shortcomings that are inevitable because it has just been established, and has established and improved a series of management systems. All the commune members are full of confidence, energetic, and are striving to realize the initiative proposed by the National and Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region Agricultural Socialist Construction Advanced Units Representative Conference in January this year, and to complete and overfulfill the production plans of 1,000 jin of wheat per mu, 252 jin of cotton (lint), 1,570 jin of corn, 1,120 jin of rice, 280 jin of oil crops, and other production plans.

    When I came to Beijing to attend the meeting this time, all the members of our team repeatedly told me that they were living a very happy life. Under the leadership of the Party, they would redouble their efforts and must enter the communist society. They also said that when you see Chairman Mao, you must tell Chairman Mao our happy mood and firm will. We are very grateful for the good leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, and thank the Party and Chairman Mao for giving us happiness. These are not just the words of the farmers in our team, but the heartfelt words of the farmers of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang. Today, I am very excited to be able to express the entrustment of all the members of our team on this platform in Huairentang.

    The laboring people are masters of their own affairs, working selflessly for their own happiness. Imperialism is not allowed to fabricate rumors, slander, and talk nonsense.

    Comrades Delegates! The imperialists, especially the American imperialists, in order to deceive their own people and the people of the world who have not yet been liberated, are afraid that the people will know the benefits of socialism and will rise up to overthrow the capitalists and feudal rule, so they fabricate rumors and slander our great leap forward and the great people's commune movement, and talk nonsense, saying that we are implementing "slave labor" and "sacrificing the people's lives and welfare." This cannot but make people extremely angry. The broad masses of farmers in our country have countless iron-like facts to shatter any slander and vilification of imperialism against us. Before liberation, my grandfather and my father worked for the landlords all their lives, and they did not get a house or an inch of land until they died. When I grew up, I could not escape the hands of the landlords, and suffered all kinds of torture from them, and I could not eat enough or wear warm clothes. At that time, we were actually the landlord's serfs. After liberation, we became masters, and for our own happiness, we must work selflessly. People like us who have been working as cattle and horses for the landlords for generations can become people's representatives today, attend the highest organ of state power - the National People's Congress, be able to meet our beloved leader Chairman Mao and other leaders, and be able to hear their valuable instructions. Doesn't this fully prove that we laboring people are masters of our own affairs?! Our great victory and happy life cannot be erased by anyone. Let those man-eating beasts howl there!

    Under the leadership of the great Chinese Communist Party and the great leader Chairman Mao, our people of all ethnic groups will unite more closely, boost our energy, work hard, and surely build socialism victoriously and move towards communist society.

    Finally, I respectfully wish Chairman Mao a long life!

    May all the delegates be healthy!

　　像爱护眼珠一样爱护人民公社
    买买提哈吾力代表的发言各位代表：
    我首先衷心拥护和祝贺刘少奇当选为中华人民共和国主席、宋庆龄、董必武当选为中华人民共和国副主席，朱德当选为全国人民代表大会常务委员会委员长、林伯渠等16人当选为副委员长，通过周恩来为国务院总理，以及选举国家机关其他领导人。我听了周恩来总理和李富春、李先念副总理、彭真副委员长的报告，感到十分兴奋，浑身增加了力量。我完全拥护各位首长的报告，并愿为其彻底实现而奋斗。
    人民公社的建立，各项事业的发展，是党和毛主席给我们少数民族带来的幸福
    我是来自祖国西部遥远边疆——新疆维吾尔自治区疏附县乌帕尔区解放人民公社的一个普通农民。在我们那里同全国其他地区一样，可以看到我们伟大祖国一天比一天富强的新气象。解放以来，我们从自己的切身体验中清楚地知道：共产党和毛主席是我们少数民族的救命恩人，永远跟着党和毛主席走，我们就永远是幸福的。去年秋季党中央发布“关于在农村建立人民公社问题的决议”，毛主席指出“还是人民公社好”，恰好道破了我们寻思已久的心思，于是我们立即热烈响应了党和毛主席的号召，把十七个高级农业社合并组成了一个人民公社。我们全体农民以极大欢乐的心情庆祝了这个伟大胜利。人民公社刚一成立，就显示了它的无比优越性。人民公社实行吃饭不要钱，这是我们祖祖辈辈从来没有梦想过的。从此，我们再也不发愁吃饭了，只有一心一意，鼓足干劲，大搞生产。人民公社实行“四化”，解放了大批的妇女劳动力，妇女同男子一样直接参加了生产。人民公社成立后，集中统一使用资金，统一调配劳动力，统一规划土地、水利，合理安排各种生产，表现了又大又公。所有这一切，就促进了生产的大跃进。一九五八年秋收秋种运动中，我们作到了“家家户户无闲人，男女老少齐上阵”，各个社员斗志昂扬，意气风发，干劲冲天，白天黑夜苦战，因而提前一个月完成了秋收任务，同时大大减少了抛撒浪费现象。往年的冬麦播种工作都要拖到十一月才能完成，但去年十月初就完成了，而且全部实行了条播密植，每亩施底肥约四万斤，比一九五七年多施肥二万多斤。在农业初级社和高级社时期，我们虽然也很努力，但每年秋翻地只能达到百分之四十左右，深度也只有十公分多些。一九五八年就不同了，所有应该秋翻的土地，全部在秋季翻完了，同时深度达到二十至三十公分。去冬今春结合整顿人民公社开展的备耕和春耕运动，其声势的浩大是以往任何一年所不能相比的。这就为今年农业的更大丰收打下了基础。这里还应该特别提到的是在去年“三秋”运动的同时，我们公社还响应党的号召抽出三分之一的精壮劳力，参加了全民大炼钢铁的运动，炼出铁七百吨，超额百分之五百八十三完成了任务。此外，自公社成立后，我们还举办了十七个多种小型工厂，七个业余文工团，队队都有识字班。农业学校，技术学校正在筹办，文化技术革命的高潮已经开始形成了。
    经过去年的苦战，我们公社获得了丰收。就以我领导的那个大队（原高级社）来说：粮食总产量比一九五七年增加百分之七十，一九五八年总收入比一九五七年增加百分之八十五，同时进行了副业生产，副业收入达八千多元。全队农副业总收入比一九五七年增加一点七五万元，因而百分之九十六的社员都增加了收入。
    我们十分珍惜自己的成绩，我们公社的社员都像爱护自己的眼珠一样，爱护着自己的人民公社，他们积极参加了整顿和健全人民公社的工作。目前我们的公社已经克服了由于它刚刚成立不久所难免发生的缺点，建立和健全了一系列的管理制度，全体社员正在满怀信心，干劲冲天，为实现今年一月全国和新疆维吾尔自治区农业社会主义建设先进单位代表会议所提出的倡议，为完成和超额完成小麦亩产一千斤，棉花二百五十二斤（皮棉），玉米一千五百七十斤，水稻一千一百二十斤，油料二百八十斤和其他生产计划而奋斗。
    当我这次来北京开会的时候，我们队的全体社员再三对我说，他们过着十分幸福的生活，在党的领导下，他们要更加鼓足干劲，一定要进入共产主义社会。他们还说，你见了毛主席的时候，一定要把我们的欢乐心情和坚定意志告诉毛主席。我们非常感谢党和毛主席的好领导，感谢党和毛主席给我们的幸福。这些不只是我队农民的话，而是我们新疆各族农民的心里话，今天我能够在怀仁堂的这个讲坛上，表达了我们队全体社员的嘱托，感到万分兴奋。
    劳动人民当家作主，为自己的幸福忘我的劳动着，不许帝国主义造谣污蔑，胡说八道
    各位代表！帝国主义者特别是美帝国主义者为了欺骗他们本国的人民和世界上还没有得到解放的人民，害怕人民知道了社会主义的好处，会起来推翻资本家和封建主义统治，于是就对我们的大跃进和伟大的人民公社化运动进行造谣污蔑，胡说八道，说我们实行“奴隶劳动”和“牺牲了人民的生活福利”。这不能不令人万分愤怒。我国广大农民群众有无数的铁一般的事实足以粉碎帝国主义对我们的任何诽谤和诬蔑。解放前，我爷爷和我父亲为地主干了一辈子活，直到临死没有得到一间房子和一寸土地；我长大成人没有逃出地主的手，受尽了他们的种种折磨，吃不饱穿不暖。那时候，我们实际上是地主的农奴。解放后，我们成了主人，为自己的幸福，我们要忘我的劳动，像我们这样过去祖祖辈辈给地主作牛马的人，今天能够成为人民代表，出席全国最高权力机关——全国人民代表大会，能够见到我们敬爱的领袖毛主席和其他首长，能够听到他们的宝贵指示，这岂不完全证明我们劳动人民当家作主了吗？！我们的伟大胜利和幸福生活，是任何人也抹煞不了的，让那些吃人血肉的人面兽在那里狂吠吧！
    我们各族人民在伟大的中国共产党和伟大领袖毛主席的领导下，更加紧密团结，更加鼓足干劲，奋发努力，一定胜利地建成社会主义和走向共产主义社会。
    最后敬祝毛主席万寿无疆！
    全体代表身体健康！
