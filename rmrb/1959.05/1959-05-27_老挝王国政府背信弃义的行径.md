The Lao Royal Government's Treacherous Actions
Lan Pu
The Lao Fighting Units and the Lao National Liberation Movement
Before World War II, the Kingdom of Laos was a colony and protectorate of France. It was a colony because it was, in fact, under French colonial rule, having lost all sovereignty and independence. It was a protectorate because, in name, France retained a symbolic "Kingdom of Luang Prabang."

French colonial rule left Laos in a state of extreme poverty and backwardness. There were only a few kilometers of railway in the entire country, no industry at all, agricultural production was extremely primitive, and 95% of the population was illiterate. However, the Lao people have revolutionary traditions. Since French imperialism invaded Laos in 1893, the people's struggle has never ceased.

During World War II, the French imperialist colonial authorities not only surrendered to Japanese fascism but also colluded with them to suppress the Lao people's struggle. After Japan's surrender in August 1945, the Lao people launched an uprising, drove out the Japanese forces, and declared independence on October 12, 1945, establishing their own government.

In 1946, French imperialism made a comeback. A part of the government, wavering and traitorous, defected to the enemy and established the so-called Royal Government. Another part, patriotic, persisted in the war of resistance, and on August 13, 1950, established the Lao Resistance Government headed by Prince Souphanouvong. The people's armed forces led by the Resistance Government were called the Lao Resistance Units, renamed the Lao Fighting Units after the 1954 Geneva Conference. Pathet Lao means "Land of the Lao (Laotian) People."

The Geneva Accords and the Lao Armistice
The Lao people's cause of resisting French colonial rule, supported by U.S. imperialism, has greatly developed since the Lao people established their own government and armed forces. The Vietnamese people, who suffered the same devastation from U.S. and French aggression as the Lao people, gave the Lao people great assistance. They sent Vietnamese People's Volunteer forces to fight alongside the Lao Resistance Units, severely打击 the French colonial army. By the eve of the 1954 Geneva Conference, the Lao Resistance Units had liberated more than half of Lao territory; appropriate democratic reforms were carried out in the liberated areas, improving the people's lives. However, imperialism, especially U.S. imperialism, was not reconciled to its defeat and tried to expand the war in Laos and throughout Indochina. The socialist camp, representing the world's peace forces, together with the people of Indochina, thoroughly exposed the U.S. imperialist plot through the Geneva Conference, shattered its attempt to expand the war, and finally restored peace in Indochina, reaching the Geneva Accords based on the recognition of the national rights of the three Indochinese peoples.

The Geneva Accords consisted of two parts: the first part was the military agreement on the cessation of hostilities in Indochina, as well as specific measures to ensure and prevent the recurrence of war, including the prohibition of the entry of reinforcing military personnel and ammunition from abroad after the ceasefire, and the establishment of an International Commission composed of representatives from India, Poland, and Canada, responsible for monitoring the implementation of the agreement. The second part was the agreement on principles for a political settlement, namely the "Final Declaration of the Geneva Conference" and the statements of relevant governments that became part of the "Final Declaration," including two statements from the Lao Royal Government.

Article 5 of the Geneva Conference's Final Declaration expressly stipulates that Laos "will not enter into any agreement with other states if this agreement includes the obligation to participate in military alliances that do not conform to the principles of the United Nations Charter and, even more so, do not conform to the principles of the Agreement on the Cessation of Hostilities in Laos, or if it includes the obligation to allow foreign military forces to establish bases on Lao territory when its security is not threatened." This means that Laos must strictly adhere to peaceful neutrality. If U.S. imperialism is allowed to drag Laos into its military bloc and establish military bases in Laos, not only will peace in Laos and Indochina not be restored, but the national independence and sovereignty that the Lao people sacrificed and struggled for from 1945 to 1954 will become empty words.

Article 3 of the Geneva Conference's Final Declaration expressly stipulates: "The Conference takes note of the statement of the Lao government that it is willing to take measures to enable all citizens to participate in the national common life." This means that the Lao Fighting Units should have the right to participate in the political life of the country without retaliation or discrimination, and the Lao Royal Government should take measures to guarantee their democratic freedoms and rights.

The above provisions of the Geneva Conference's Final Declaration, together with the clauses in the Agreement on the Cessation of Hostilities regarding the prohibition of the entry of military personnel and ammunition from abroad after the ceasefire and the establishment of an International Commission to monitor the implementation of the agreement, constitute international guarantees for the restoration of peace in Laos and the possibility for the Lao people to live peacefully and engage in peaceful construction on their own land. Even U.S. imperialism, which opposes the Lao people, had to declare under the pressure of world opinion: "The United States will not use threats or force to disrupt these agreements and provisions (the Geneva Accords)."

What agreements did the Lao Royal Government sign with the Lao Fighting Units?
After the Lao armistice, the Vietnamese volunteer forces withdrew from Laos as scheduled, and the Lao Fighting Units also assembled in the two provinces of Sam Neua and Phong Saly in accordance with the agreement, awaiting the political settlement stipulated in the Geneva Accords.

Prince Souphanouvong began consultations with Prince Souvanna Phouma, the Prime Minister of the Lao Royal Government, in September 1954 to achieve the political settlement stipulated in the Geneva Accords. Under U.S. obstruction, the negotiations were fruitless. After Katay Don Sasorith came to power, the U.S. instigated the Royal Army to launch a large-scale offensive against the provinces of Phong Saly and Sam Neua, where the Lao Fighting Units were concentrated, in violation of the Geneva Accords, but suffered a shameful defeat. The Katay cabinet also collapsed. In March 1956, Souvanna Phouma, who advocated peaceful neutrality, formed a new cabinet, resumed negotiations with the Lao Fighting Units on August 1, reached a principled agreement on August 5 and 10, and instructed the Joint Political Committee and the Joint Military Committee composed of representatives from both sides to continue consultations in order to implement these principled agreements. On November 2, 1956, both sides reached a detailed agreement on the implementation of the policy of peaceful neutrality; on December 24, an agreement was reached on guaranteeing the civil rights of the personnel of the Lao Fighting Units and their supporters. On December 28, 1956, Souphanouvong and Souvanna Phouma issued a joint statement again, expressing satisfaction with the various agreements that had been reached, and stating that the two delegations were very close in their views on the outstanding issues, especially the protection of the people's democratic freedoms, supplementary elections, and the administrative issues of Sam Neua and Phong Saly provinces, and that they must redouble their efforts to resolve them in the shortest possible time.

However, these achievements of the Lao people were strongly opposed by U.S. imperialism. The U.S. "Nation" weekly revealed that "U.S. authorities have been hinting that the entire agreement of December 28, 1956, should be cancelled, and the Royal Government should end all dealings with the Lao Fighting Units." U.S. diplomatic officials also told Laos that if personnel of the Lao Fighting Units participated in the government, the U.S. would no longer give Laos any "aid." Under U.S. pressure, the Souvanna Phouma cabinet was forced to resign, and the negotiations were interrupted again. However, peaceful neutrality and national unity are the wishes of all Lao people, and the pro-American faction failed to form a cabinet several times. Prince Souvanna Phouma succeeded in forming a cabinet again in August 1957 and resumed negotiations between the two sides. A comprehensive agreement was reached on November 2, 1957, resolving the issues that had not been resolved before.

All of the above agreements can be summarized as follows:

First, both sides (the Lao Royal Government and the Lao Fighting Units) shall, in accordance with the Geneva Accords, seek to resolve issues related to both sides so that Laos can achieve peace, democracy, unity, and further consolidate national independence.

Second, both sides endorse the policy of peaceful neutrality that Prince Savang Vatthana and Prime Minister Souvanna Phouma have repeatedly announced and that the Royal Government is determined to pursue. Laos will establish friendly relations with all countries, especially its neighbors, will not join any military alliance, and will not allow any country to establish military bases on Lao territory, except as stipulated in the Geneva Accords. This is in the interest of all Lao people.

Third, the delegation of the Royal Government assures the Lao Fighting Units that it will formally announce again, so that all people know that the Lao people enjoy all democratic freedoms and rights, such as freedom of speech, publication, assembly, and travel, and agrees that all Lao men and women citizens have the right to elect and be elected, and announces that the local governments have abolished the corvee labor and the system of local headmen that were implemented under the rule of the colonialists.

Fourth, both sides agree that the political organizations of the Lao Fighting Units, such as the Lao Patriotic Front and various organizations such as women, youth, and peasants, can operate under the laws of the Kingdom like other parties.

Fifth, guarantee the civil rights of the Lao Fighting Units and resistance personnel, and do not treat these people differently. Cadres of the Lao Fighting Units and former resistance personnel must be allowed to participate in governments at all levels and professional departments according to their abilities and based on agreements reached between the two sides and mutual accommodation. Both sides agree that all Lao Fighting Units personnel, people associated with the Lao Fighting Units, and former resistance personnel have made significant contributions to the struggle for national independence, so it is reasonable to protect them from discrimination and retaliation. These guarantees will be in line with the wishes of the whole people and will promote national reconciliation and the unity of the motherland. Acts of discrimination, retaliation, or prohibition against their democratic freedoms and civil rights, and any wanted, arrested, or slandered will be considered violations of this agreement and will be wanted by the court as acts of dividing the country, undermining the unity of the motherland, and infringing on democratic freedoms and the civil rights of the people.

Sixth, regarding the administrative cadres and cadres and personnel of various technical departments trained by the Lao Fighting Units, the Royal Government will regard the years they served in the resistance forces as the years they served in the Royal administrative organs, and will try to employ them according to the positions, ranks, and specialties given by the Lao Fighting Units, so that they can enjoy the same rights as Royal personnel of the same level in all aspects.

Seventh, supplementary elections shall be held in a free and secret voting manner with the participation of the Lao Fighting Units and former resistance personnel, in order to increase the number of members of the National Assembly to conform to the number of candidates stipulated in the draft election law submitted by the Royal Government to the National Assembly. The election law to be drafted by the National Assembly shall guarantee the right to elect and be elected for all men and women citizens based on the principles of equality, directness, freedom, and secret ballot; the election law shall contain measures to ensure justice and make fraud impossible.

Eighth, a coalition government with the participation of representatives of the Lao Fighting Units shall be organized. This will symbolize national reconciliation on the basis of a suitable political program to build a peaceful, democratic, unified, independent, and prosperous Laos. The representativeness of the new government will arise from the formal handover of the two provinces of Phong Saly and Sam Neua and the Lao Fighting Units to the Royal Government. Regarding the political program of the coalition government, both sides agreed to adopt the action program of the current government proposed by Prince Souvanna Phouma in his speech on August 8, 1957.

Ninth, both sides agree to practically restore the Royal government in the provinces of Phong Saly and Sam Neua, and to incorporate the civil servants and combat personnel of the Lao Fighting Units.

Tenth, both sides hope that the International Commission will continue to provide full assistance until the spirit of the Geneva Accords resolves all these issues.

How did the Lao Royal Government violate the agreements?

Since the signing of the above agreements, the Lao Fighting Units have faithfully fulfilled their obligations. On November 18, 1957, Prince Souphanouvong, on behalf of the Lao Fighting Units, handed over the administrative power of Phong Saly and Sam Neua provinces to the King of Laos. In mid-January 1958, two battalions of Lao Fighting Units (a total of 1,500 men) were incorporated into the Lao Royal Army, and the remaining combat personnel were demobilized and returned to their hometowns to produce. The Lao Fighting Units also handed over all combat materials and ammunition to the Royal Government.

However, since Phoui Sananikone came to power in August 1958, the Lao Royal Government, under the manipulation of U.S. imperialism, has completely violated the above agreements.

First, it succumbed to the will of the United States and issued a statement on February 11, 1959, openly abandoning the Geneva Accords, thereby endangering the peace, democracy, unity, and independence of Laos.

Second, it abandoned the policy of peaceful neutrality stipulated in the Geneva Accords and the agreements between the two sides. U.S. military personnel and U.S. weapons poured into Laos in large quantities, controlling the Lao army and police, establishing U.S. military bases throughout Laos, and recently attempting to establish a large U.S. military base in Lower Laos (southern Laos). U.S. and Philippine, Thai, South Vietnamese, and Taiwanese agents established liaison stations on the border between China and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. Under U.S. instigation, the Lao authorities also colluded with the remnants of Chiang Kai-shek's forces, providing the remnants of the Chiang army with a base for harassing the Chinese border. Lao aircraft constantly violated Chinese and Vietnamese airspace. In December 1958, the Lao army invaded the Huong Lap area of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. Lao authorities have repeatedly sent representatives to participate in military exercises of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization (SEATO). Some responsible officials in Laos, including Army Chief of Staff Rathikoun, have repeatedly clamored that "Laos is within the SEATO defense area." All of these seriously violate the policy of peaceful neutrality of the Geneva Accords and the agreements between the two sides.

Third, depriving the people of their democratic freedoms and rights. Local authorities in Laos prohibit people from dealing with the Lao Patriotic Front organs, and some places prohibit people from reading "Patriotic Newspaper," and threaten that those who do not comply with this order will be punished as "traitors" and communists. Some places simply prohibit the distribution of "Patriotic Newspaper."

Fourth, depriving the Lao Patriotic Front of its right as a legitimate political party. Local authorities in Laos force Lao Patriotic Front members to withdraw from the party, while requiring these members to sign pre-prepared withdrawal applications in the local area. Those who refuse to sign are intimidated, arrested, or killed. After signing, the local authorities take the withdrawal applications to the government radio station for broadcasting. The tragic killing of Thit Don, the secretary of the Lao Patriotic Front Committee in Phonhong District, Vientiane Province, on January 5, 1959, is an example.

Fifth, the Royal authorities kill former Lao Fighting Units personnel throughout the country. According to Prince Souphanouvong's disclosure, in Attapeu Province, in addition to Tao Kong (transliteration) being killed in Ban Xaysao on November 29, 1958, 63 former Lao Fighting Units personnel were subjected to long-term detention. In Phong Saly Province, 36 people were arrested and 22 were killed. Similar incidents also occurred in large numbers in Saravane Province, Savannakhet Province, Khammouane Province, Vientiane Province, Xieng Khouang Province, Luang Prabang Province, and Sam Neua Province.

Sixth, discrimination against the cadres of the former Lao Fighting Units and the two battalions incorporated into the Royal Army. According to the agreement, the two battalions incorporated into the Royal Army should be incorporated at the same time and as a whole, and maintain their original ranks without being reduced. However, the Royal side only granted a military rank to Colonel Sinkapo, and everyone else was to be demoted by one rank, and the salaries and allowances that should have been paid since the establishment of the coalition government were not paid. Attempts were made to provoke and alienate the relationship between the officers and soldiers of the two battalions.

Seventh, rampant fraud in supplementary elections. Some ministers of the Kingdom ordered civil servants, district chiefs, and village chiefs not to allow candidates of the Lao Patriotic Front or its sympathizers to be elected, otherwise they would be dismissed. In Attapeu Province, votes for Lao Patriotic Front candidates were even poured into the ballot boxes of the ruling party by the Royal side, causing Lao Patriotic Front candidates to lose the election. The Royal side even dispatched a large number of military police and agents to threaten voters.

Eighth, excluding Prince Souphanouvong and Minister Phoumi Vongvichit, who represented the former Lao Fighting Units, from the coalition government.

Ninth, dismissing the cadres of the former Lao Fighting Units (including the governor of Phong Saly Province and the deputy governor of Sam Neua Province) who held positions in the administrative organs at all levels in the two provinces according to the agreement.

Tenth, opposing the International Commission from continuing to perform its duties in Laos, and even forbidding the International Commission's aircraft from landing in Vientiane.

It can be seen that the Lao Royal Government has violated the Geneva Accords and all the agreements between it and the Lao Fighting Units. On May 11, 1959, the Lao Royal Government, on the pretext that the two battalions of the former Lao Fighting Units incorporated into the Royal Army did not accept military ranks, ordered the disarmament of the two battalions; at the same time, the Royal military police closely monitored and placed under house arrest the leaders of the Lao Patriotic Front and the former Lao Fighting Units throughout the country. In this way, it completely tore up the Geneva Accords and the agreements between the two sides, openly launched a civil war within Laos, thereby undermining peace in Indochina and aggravating the tension in Southeast Asia.

    老挝王国政府背信弃义的行径
    兰圃
    寮国战斗部队和老挝民族解放运动
    老挝王国在第二次世界大战以前是法国的殖民地和保护国。说它是殖民地，因为事实上它是在法国殖民统治之下，丧失了任何主权和独立；说它是保护国，因为名义上法国还保留了一个象征性的“琅勃拉邦王国”。
    法国的殖民统治使得老挝处于极端贫困和落后的状态。全国只有几公里铁路，根本没有工业，农业生产极为原始，人口中95％是文盲。但是老挝人民是有革命传统的。自从法帝国主义1893年侵入老挝以来，人民的斗争没有间断过。
    法帝国主义的殖民当局在第二次世界大战中，不仅投降了日本法西斯，而且还同他们勾结起来，镇压老挝人民的斗争。1945年8月日本投降，老挝人民举行起义，驱逐了日本势力，于1945年10月12日宣告独立，建立自己的政权。
    1946年法帝国主义卷土重来，政府中一部分动摇分子叛国投敌，成立所谓王国政府，另一部分爱国分子坚持抗战，并且于1950年8月13日成立了以苏发努冯亲王为首的寮国抗战政府。抗战政府领导的人民武装称为寮国抗战部部，1954年日内瓦会议以后改称寮国战斗部队。寮国（PATHET LAO）即“寮人（老挝人）之国”的意思。
      日内瓦协议和老挝停战
    老挝人民抗击在美帝国主义支持下的法国殖民统治的事业，自从老挝人民建立了自己的政府和武装力量以后，有很大的发展。同老挝人民一样遭受美法侵略势力蹂躏的越南人民给了老挝人民很大的帮助。他们派出越南人民志愿部队，同寮国抗战部队并肩作战，狠狠地打击法国殖民军。到1954年日内瓦会议开幕前夕，寮国抗战部队已经解放了老挝一半以上的国土；在解放地区进行了适当的民主改革，使得人民生活有所改善。但是帝国主义，特别是美帝国主义，并不甘心于它们的失败，极力要扩大老挝和整个印度支那的战争。代表世界和平力量的社会主义阵营同印度支那人民一道，通过日内瓦会议，彻底揭露美帝国主义的阴谋，粉碎了它扩大战争的企图，终于使印度支那的和平得到恢复，并且在承认印度支那三国人民民族权利的基础上达成了日内瓦协议。
    日内瓦协议共有两个组成部分：第一部分是关于停止印度支那敌对行动的军事协定，以及为保证和防止战争复发的各项具体措施，包括停战后不得自境外进入增援性的军事人员和武器弹药，以及建立由印度、波兰、加拿大代表组成的国际委员会，负责监察协议的实施。第二部分是关于政治解决的原则协议，即“日内瓦会议最后宣言”和成为“最后宣言”组成部分的有关各国政府声明，其中就有老挝王国政府的两项声明。
    日内瓦会议最后宣言第五条明文规定：老挝“将不与其他国家缔结任何协定，如果此项协定包括参加不符合于联合国宪章原则的，而在老挝又更不符合于老挝停止敌对行动协定原则的军事同盟的义务，或包括当它的安全不受威胁时在老挝领土上为外国军事力量建立基地的义务。”这就是说，老挝必须严守和平中立。如果容许美帝国主义把老挝拉进它的军事集团，在老挝建立军事基地；那么，不仅老挝和印度支那的和平无法恢复，老挝人民从1945年到1954年为之牺牲奋斗的民族独立和主权完整也将成为一句空话。
    日内瓦会议最后宣言第三条明文规定：“会议注意到老挝政府的声明，即它愿意采取使全体公民均能参加全国共同生活的措施。”这就是说，寮国战斗部队应该有权利参加国家的政治生活而不受报复歧视，老挝王国政府应该采取措施保障他们的民主自由权利。
    日内瓦会议最后宣言的上述规定，连同停止敌对行动协定中关于停战后不得自境外进入军事人员和武器弹药、建立国际委员会监察协议的实施等条款，构成恢复老挝的和平和使老挝人民有可能在他们自己的土地上过和平生活和从事和平建设的国际保证。连反对老挝人民的美帝国主义，在世界舆论的压力下，也不得不声明：“美国将不使用威胁或武力去妨害这些协定和条款（日内瓦协议）”。
    老挝王国政府同寮国战斗部队之间签订了一些什么协议
    老挝停战后，越南志愿部队如期全部撤出老挝，寮国战斗部队也按照协议集结于桑怒和丰沙里两省，等待日内瓦协议规定的政治解决。
    苏发努冯亲王于1954年9月就开始同老挝王国政府首相富马亲王举行协商，以求得日内瓦协议规定的政治解决的实现。在美国阻挠下，谈判没有结果。卡代·萨索里特上台后，美国策动王国军队，违反日内瓦协议，向寮国战斗部队集结的丰沙里和桑怒两省大举进攻，但是遭到了可耻的失败。卡代内阁也随之垮台。1956年3月，主张和平中立的富马重新组阁，8月1日恢复同寮国战斗部队的谈判，8月5日、和10日达成原则协议，并且责成由双方代表组成的联合政治委员会和联合军事委员会继续协商，以便实现这些原则协议。1956年11月2日双方达成了关于执行和平中立政策的细节协议；12月24日达成了关于保证寮国战斗部队的人员及其拥护者的公民权利的协议。1956年12月28日苏发努冯和富马再次发表联合声明，对已达成的各项协议表示满意，并且表示双方代表团对于尚未解决的问题，特别是保障人民的民主自由、补充选举、桑怒和丰沙里两省的行政问题，观点已经非常接近，必须加倍努力，以便在尽可能短的期间内得到解决。
    但是老挝人民这些成就却遭到美帝国主义的极力反对。美国“民族”周刊透露，“美国当局一直在暗示，应该把1956年12月28日的整个协议取消，王国政府应该结束同寮国战斗部队的一切来往”。美国外交官员还对老挝说，如果寮国战斗部队人员参加政府的话，美国将不再给老挝任何“援助”。在美国压力下，富马内阁被迫辞职，双方谈判又告中断。但是和平中立和民族团结乃是全体老挝人民的愿望，亲美派几次组阁都告失败。富马亲王于1957年8月再次组阁成功，并且恢复了双方的谈判。1957年11月2日达成了全面协议，解决了以前没有解决的问题。
    所有上述各项协议，归结起来主要有如下几点内容：
    一、双方（老挝王国政府和寮国战斗部队）按照日内瓦协议设法解决有关双方的问题，使老挝得到和平、民主、统一，并且使民族独立更加巩固。
    二、双方赞成萨旺太子和梭发那·富马亲王首相曾经多次宣布的和王国政府坚决奉行的和平中立政策。老挝将与各国，特别是各邻国，建立友好的关系，不加入任何军事联盟，除日内瓦协议规定的情况外，不让任何国家在老挝的领土上建立军事基地。这样才符合全体老挝人民的利益。
    三、王国政府代表团向寮国战斗部队保证，他将再次正式宣布，让全体人民知道：老挝人民享有一切民主自由权利，如言论、出版、集会、往来等自由，赞成全体老挝男女公民有选举和被选举权，并且宣布地方政权已经取消在殖民者统治下实施过的劳工杂役和土官制度。
    四、双方同意寮国战斗部队方面的政治组织，如老挝爱国党和妇女、青年、农民等各个组织，能够在王国的法律下同其他党派一样进行活动。
    五、保证寮国战斗部队和抗战人员的公民权利，并且不分别对待这些人。必须让寮国战斗部队的干部和前抗战人员按照他们的能力和根据双方之间达成的协议和互相间的容让，使他们参加各级政权和专业部门。双方一致认为，全国的寮国战斗部队人员、同寮国战斗部队有关的人和前抗战人员对于民族独立的斗争已经作出重大贡献，所以保障他们不受歧视和报复，都是合情合理的。这些保障将符合于全民的愿望，而能促进民族的和解和祖国的统一。对他们的民主自由和公民权利采取歧视、报复或禁止性质的行为，和任何通缉、逮捕或诬蔑都将被认为是违反本协议的行为，将被法庭作为分裂国家、破坏祖国的统一、侵犯民主自由和人民的公民权利而加以通缉。
    六、关于由寮国战斗部队培养的行政干部和各技术部门的干部和人员，王国政府将把他们在抗战队伍中服务的年度看作在王国行政机关服务的年度，而且将努力按寮国战斗部队所给予的职务、级别和专业录用他们，使他们在各方面能够和同一级别的王国人员享受同等的权利。
    七、按照自由和秘密投票的方式举行有寮国战斗部队和前抗战人员参加的补充选举，以便增加国会议员人数，使之符合王国政府在国会提出的选举法草案中所规定的候选人人数。将由国会拟定的选举法要根据平等、直接、自由和秘密投票的原则保障全体男女公民的选举权和被选举权；该选举法含有保障正义和使舞弊成为不可能的措施。
    八、组织有寮国战斗部队的代表参加的联合政府。这将象征着一个适宜的政治纲领的基础上的民族和解，以建设一个和平、民主、统一、独立和繁荣的老挝。新政府的代表性将由于丰沙里和桑怒两省和寮国战斗部队正式移交给王国政府而产生。关于联合政府的政纲，双方同意采取富马亲王在1957年8月8日的演说中提出的该届政府的行动纲领。
    九、双方同意在丰沙里和桑怒两省实际地恢复王国政权，归并寮国战斗部队的公务人员和战斗人员。
    十、双方希望国际委员会继续给予全力的帮助，直到日内瓦协议的精神使这一切问题都得到解决的时候为止。
  老挝王国政府是如何破坏协议的
    自从上述各项协议签订以后，寮国战斗部队忠实地履行了它所承担的义务。1957年11月18日苏发努冯亲王代表寮国战斗部队将丰沙里和桑怒两省行政权移交给了老挝国王。1958年1月中旬两营寮国战斗部队（共一千五百人）并入老挝王国军队，其余的战斗人员复员回乡生产。寮国战斗部队还将全部作战物资和武器弹药交给王国政府。
    但是自从1958年8月培·萨纳尼空上台以后，老挝王国政府在美帝国主义操纵下，彻底违反了上述各项协议。
    一、首先，它屈从美国意志，在1959年2月11日发表声明公然毁弃日内瓦协议，从而使得老挝的和平、民主、统一和独立陷于危险的境地。
    二、它毁弃了日内瓦协议和双方协议规定的和平中立政策。美国军事人员和美国武器大量涌入老挝，控制老挝的军队和警察，在老挝各地设立美国军事基地，最近还企图在下寮（老挝南部）建立大型的美军基地。美国和菲律宾、泰国、南越、台湾特务在中国和越南民主共和国边境建立特务联络站。老挝当局还在美国唆使下同蒋介石集团残余武装相勾结，为残余蒋军提供骚扰我边境的活动基地。老挝飞机不断侵犯中国和越南领空。1958年12月，老挝陆军侵犯了越南民主共和国向立地区。老挝当局多次派出代表参加东南亚条约侵略组织的军事演习。老挝的一些负责官员，包括陆军参谋长拉提曲耳，多次叫嚷“老挝是在东南亚条约组织防御地区之内”。所有这些严重地违反日内瓦协议和双方协议的和平中立政策。
    三、剥夺人民的民主自由权利。老挝的各地地方当局禁止人民同老挝爱国党机关来往，有的地方禁止人民读“爱国报”，并且威胁说，不遵守这一命令的人，将被当作“叛国者”和共产党员处罚。有些地方干脆禁止“爱国报”的发行。
    四、剥夺爱国党作为一个合法政党的权利。老挝的地方当局强迫爱国党党员退党，同时要这些党员在当地事先准备好的退党申请书上签字。不肯签字的人就受到恐吓、逮捕或杀害，签字后地方当局就把退党申请书拿到政府电台上去广播。在万象省丰红县，爱国党党委书记梯东于1959年1月5日惨遭杀害就是一个例子。
    五、王国当局在全国范围内杀害前寮国战斗部队人员。仅据苏发努冯亲王揭露，在阿速坡省，除陶空（音译）于1958年11月29日在班西骚被打死外，还有六十三名前寮国战斗部队人员遭到长期拘留。丰沙里省也有三十六人被捕和二十二人被杀害。这类事情在沙拉湾省、沙湾拿吉省、甘蒙省、万象省、川圹省、琅勃拉邦省、桑怒省也大量发生。
    六、歧视前寮国战斗部队的干部和并入王国军队的两营部队。根据协议，并入王国军队的两营部队应该同时、整个编制并入，并且保持他们的原级别，不予降低。但是王国方面只授给辛卡波上校一人军衔，对其余人均要降低一级，并且不发自联合政府成立之日起应发的薪金和津贴。企图挑拨和离间两营官兵之间的关系。
    七、在补充选举中大肆舞弊。王国某些部长命令公务人员、区长、村长不准爱国党或它的同情者的候选人当选，否则就要把他们解职。在阿速坡省，投爱国党候选人的选票甚至被王国方面倒入执政党的票箱，致使爱国党的候选人落选。王国方面更出动大批军警和特务对选民进行威胁。
    八、将代表前寮国战斗部队的苏发努冯亲王和富米·冯维希两位部长排挤出联合政府。
    九、将根据协议在两省各级行政机关担任职务的前寮国战斗部队干部（包括丰沙里省省长和桑怒省副省长）免除职务。
    十、反对国际委员会在老挝继续行使它的职务，甚至不准国际委员会的飞机在万象降落。
    由此可见，老挝王国政府违反了日内瓦协议和它同寮国战斗部队之间的全部协议。1959年5月11日，老挝王国政府以并入王国军队的两营前寮国战斗部队不接受军衔为借口，下令解除两营武装；与此同时，王国军警在全国范围内严密监视和软禁了老挝爱国党和前寮国战斗部队的领导人。这样它就彻底撕毁了日内瓦协议和双方之间协议，在老挝境内公然发动内战，进而破坏印度支那和平和加剧东南亚地区的紧张局势。
