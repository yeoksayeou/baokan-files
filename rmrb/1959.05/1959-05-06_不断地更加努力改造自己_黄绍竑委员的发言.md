　　Constantly Work Harder to Transform Myself
    Speech by Committee Member Huang Shaohong

    Chairman, fellow committee members:

    I fully endorse Premier Zhou's government work report, Vice Premier and Director Li Fuchun's report on the draft national economic plan for 1959, Vice Premier and Minister Li Xiannian's report on the 1958 national financial accounts and the draft 1959 national budget, and Vice Chairman Li Weihan's work report of the Standing Committee of the Second National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. Premier Zhou pointed out in his report, "Regarding bourgeois rightists, we have adopted a lenient approach to help them transform, not depriving them of their civil rights, and appropriately arranging their work and lives, so as to transform all those who can be transformed into new people as much as possible." I was very moved and grateful when I heard this!

    In 1957, I committed the crimes of opposing the leadership of the Party, exaggerating shortcomings, obliterating the great achievements of socialist construction, and sympathizing with counter-revolutionary elements. For the past two years, I have personally received the Party's meticulous education and transformation of rightists, which has enabled me to gradually realize the seriousness of the crimes I committed. This session of the Political Consultative Conference has also retained some rightists who expressed their willingness to repent as committee members, and they can participate in inspections together with other people's representatives and CPPCC members. I realized that this is just as Premier Zhou instructed, "help them transform" and "transform them into new people." My participation in the inspection in Beijing this time is for the purpose of self-transformation.

    Through this inspection, I personally saw the great achievements made by workers and peasants under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, under the guidance of the general line of socialist construction, in the Great Leap Forward of 1958, and the unparalleled momentum of continuing the leap forward and galloping forward in 1959. The victory of the Great Leap Forward is also the victory of the anti-rightist rectification campaign. The greatness of the achievements of the Great Leap Forward fully reflects the seriousness of the rightists' crimes against the Party, against the people, and against socialism. This is my most profound understanding and is most helpful to my transformation.

    In addition, I have also recognized many issues that are helpful to my transformation:

    First, I visited several large, medium, and small factories in Beijing. According to reports from responsible comrades, the average monthly wage of workers in each factory has not exceeded sixty yuan, but they create at least ten thousand yuan or even tens of thousands of yuan of wealth for the country every year. After hearing these reports, I thought, how ashamed and frightened I am, a person who has committed serious crimes and cannot create even a single cent of wealth for the country, but on the contrary, directly and indirectly consumes thousands of yuan of the country's wealth every year. My current life is incompatible with the Great Leap Forward in socialist construction, and my stance and ideology have not been transformed well, and are far from the Great Leap Forward in socialist construction. I must be determined to step up the transformation of my stance, ideology, and life.

    Second, I visited the electron tube factory, which is a factory with cutting-edge technology and one of the important factories designed and equipped with the help of the Soviet Union. With the selfless assistance of Soviet experts, in a short period of time, Chinese workers and technicians quickly mastered the cutting-edge technology. From this, I further realized that the Soviet Union's assistance is an indispensable and great force in China's socialist construction, and I further realized the absurdity and reaction of certain rightists' anti-Soviet remarks. According to reports from responsible comrades, there was no problem in mastering the cutting-edge technology with the selfless assistance of Soviet experts. What became a problem at that time was the difficulty in solving the problem of workers queuing for meals. Later, communist education was carried out, and the problem was solved smoothly. Now the cafeteria is unmanned, the most clean and hygienic, and the accounts are accurate without the slightest error (it is said that there was an error of two ten-thousandths at the beginning). I was very moved after hearing this report. I realized the noble qualities of the working class and the beautiful morality of communism, thereby strengthening my confidence in building a communist society.

    Third, I visited the Xuanwu Steel Factory in Xuanwu District, which was a steel factory that started from scratch in the Great Leap Forward of 1958. It was organized by the masses in Xuanwu District under the leadership of the Party. The factory base was built by the voluntary labor of the masses in Xuanwu District. The workers were small merchants and peddlers in Xuanwu District, and now they have become skilled fighters on China's steel front. Although the cost of iron is still higher and it is still losing money, the main reason is due to raw material transportation costs and fuel. Even if the unit accounting of the factory lost a little, it fulfilled its mission on the entire steel front, trained many steel fighters for the entire steel front, and it is worthwhile in the unified planning of the whole country, which is impossible in any capitalist country. From this, I realized the superiority of the socialist system.

    Fourth, I visited a bicycle factory, which was originally individual laborers in Beijing who repaired bicycles, without any capital or machinery. When they were first organized, each individual laborer only brought a few pliers or a few hammers. In the Great Leap Forward of 1958, under the leadership and call of the Party, the workers exerted soaring energy and wisdom, and made some indigenous machines to manufacture bicycles (except for chains and rubber tires). The Giant Dragon brand bicycle of the factory is very light and suitable for bicycle competitions. In addition, it also provides a large number of bicycle parts to the city and serves the repair of hundreds of thousands of bicycles in the city. It has never asked the government for money, but it creates millions of yuan of wealth for the country every year. This made me realize the great power of organizing the masses under the leadership of the Party.

    Fifth, I visited the Beijing Tuberculosis Hospital, which is a very specialized and well-equipped tuberculosis hospital. It specializes in receiving severe tuberculosis patients from other hospitals. It has no outpatient service and its medical efficiency is very high. According to the annual statistics, the mortality rate is only six per thousand. According to the report from the responsible comrade, the reason for such good results is that it simultaneously uses the treatment of both traditional Chinese medicine and Western medicine, Chinese medicine and Western medicine, and unifies the use of Chinese and Western medicine. It is said that some patients who suffered from tuberculous meningitis either became blind or suffered from quadriplegia. Western medicine believes that this is an incurable disease, but it was cured by using acupuncture methods of traditional Chinese medicine. The living examples are there. I didn't believe in traditional Chinese medicine before, and I can't help but believe it after seeing it. I asked how many Chinese medicine practitioners are there in the hospital? The responsible comrade said no, the treatment methods of traditional Chinese medicine are all mastered by Western doctors. This made me realize the correctness of the Party's policy of requiring Western doctors to learn traditional Chinese medicine, and my distrust of traditional Chinese medicine is extremely absurd and naive.

    In short, this inspection and participation in this conference have been of great help to my transformation. Before 1957, whether I participated in inspections, looked at anything, or participated in conferences and looked at any documents, I felt that there were many issues to raise some opinions. In fact, at that time, I was looking at problems from a reactionary standpoint and with old viewpoints. Therefore, the opinions I raised were wrong and reactionary. Now it is just the opposite. I can't see any problems. Even if I find some individual and extremely small shortcomings, I will understand that this is unavoidable in the overall Great Leap Forward. The leading party or responsible comrades have already understood and paid attention to it, and under the guidance of the Party's nationwide unified plan, the infinite wisdom of the masses will surely be able to solve it quickly. I have 120,000 points of confidence in the overall and continued Great Leap Forward in 1959, but the degree of transformation is still far from enough. I can only constantly work harder to transform myself, and always follow forward under the leadership of the Party, so as not to fail the profound significance of the Party's lenient treatment.

### 不断地更加努力改造自己  黄绍竑委员的发言

专栏：

　　不断地更加努力改造自己
    黄绍竑委员的发言主席、各位委员：
    我完全拥护周总理的政府工作报告，李富春副总理兼主任委员关于一九五九年国民经济计划草案的报告，李先念副总理兼部长关于一九五八年国家决算和一九五九年国家预算草案的报告和李维汉副主席的中国人民政治协商会议第二届全国委员会常务委员会工作报告。周总理的报告中指出“对于资产阶级右派分子，我们采取了帮助他们进行改造的宽大处理办法，不剥夺他们的公民权，并且适当地安排他们的工作和生活，以便把一切可以改造的人尽可能地逐步地改造成为新人。”我听了这段话非常的感动和感谢！
    一九五七年我曾经犯过反对党的领导，夸大缺点抹煞社会主义建设的伟大成绩和同情反革命分子的罪行。两年以来我亲自受到党对右派分子无微不至的教育改造，使我一步一步地认识了自己所犯罪行的严重。本届政治协商会议还保留了一部分表示愿意悔改的右派分子为委员，并且能和其他人民代表、政协委员一道参加视察。我体会到这正如周总理所指示的“帮助他们改造”“改造成为新人”。我这次参加北京市的视察，就是本着自我改造的目的来进行的。
    通过这次的视察，我亲自看到了工人和农民在中国共产党和毛主席领导之下，在社会主义建设总路线指导之下，一九五八年大跃进已经获得的伟大成绩和一九五九年继续跃进、万马奔腾的无比气势。大跃进的胜利也就是反右整风的胜利，大跃进胜利成绩的伟大，充分反映出右派分子反党、反人民、反社会主义罪恶的重大。这是我总的最深刻的认识，是最有助于我改造的。
    此外，还认识了许多问题，都是于我改造有帮助的：
    一、我在北京看了若干大、中、小型的工厂。据负责同志的报告，各厂工人每月平均工资还没有超过六十元的，但是他们每年为国家所创造的财富，至少在一万元以上有高至数万元的。我听了这些报告之后，我想，像我这样犯了严重罪行又不能为国家创造一分一毫财富的人，相反地每年直接间接却要消耗国家数千元的财富，内心是何等的惭愧和何等的惶恐。我现在的生活是与社会主义建设大跃进的生活不相适应的，我的立场思想也未改造得好，与社会主义建设大跃进相差很远，我必须决心加紧立场思想的改造和生活的改造。
    二、我参观了电子管厂，这是一个尖端技术的工厂，是苏联帮助我国设计装备重要工厂之一。在苏联专家无私帮助之下，在短短时间之内，我国工人和技术人员很快地掌握了尖端的技术。我由此更加认识到苏联的帮助是我国社会主义建设不可缺少的伟大力量，我更加认识到某些右派分子反苏言论的荒谬反动。据负责同志的报告，该厂在掌握尖端技术方面有苏联专家的无私援助不成什么问题，而当时成为问题的乃是工人的食饭排队难以解决。后来进行了共产主义教育，问题就顺利解决了，现在食堂是无人管理的，是最清洁卫生的，账目是丝毫不错的（据说最初的时候有万分之二的错误）。我听了这个报告真是非常感动，我于此认识了工人阶级的高贵品质与共产主义的优美道德，从而加强了我对于建成共产主义社会的信心。
    三、我看了宣武区宣武钢厂，是一九五八年大跃进中平地起家的钢厂，是由宣武区的群众在党的领导下组织起来的。厂基是由宣武区群众义务劳动建成的，工人是宣武区的小商小贩，现在已成为我国钢铁战线上的熟练战士。虽然铁的成本还高一些要亏本，主要的原因是由于原料运费和燃料的关系。即使在该厂的单位核算上稍微亏了一些，但它在整个钢铁战线上达成了任务，为整个钢铁战线上训练了不少的钢铁战士，在全国一盘棋统一计划内是合算的，这是在任何资本主义国家所做不到的。我于此认识了社会主义制度的优越性。
    四、我看了自行车制造厂，它原来是北京市内修理自行车的个体劳动者，没有一个资本，没有一部机器。当起初组织起来的时候，各个体劳动者仅随身带来了几把钳子或几把锤子。在一九五八年大跃进中工人们在党的领导下、号召下，发挥了冲天干劲和智慧，自造了一些土机器，就把自行车制造出来了（除链子和胶胎不能制造）。该厂的巨龙牌自行车是很轻便的，是适合于自行车比赛之用的。此外还供给本市大批的自行车零件并为本市数十万辆自行车修理而服务，它没有向政府要过钱，而每年却为国家创造数百万元的财富。于此使我认识到在党领导之下把群众组织起来的伟大力量。
    五、我看了北京市结核病院，那是很专门、设备很新的结核病院，它专接收其他医院的重结核病人，没有门诊，医疗效率很高，全年统计仅有千分之六的死亡。据负责同志的报告，所以有这样好的效果是由于同时采用了中医和西医、中药和西药的治疗，把中国医学和西洋医学统一运用起来。据说有的病人患了结核性脑膜炎之后或者发生了眼盲或者发生了四肢瘫痪，在西医则认为这是不治之症，而是用中医针灸的方法把他们治好了的，活生生的实例摆在那里，我以前是不信中医的，看了也不能不信服。我问院里有多少中医师？负责同志说没有，中医的治疗方法都是由西医师来掌握的。于此使我认识到党要西医师学习中医政策的正确，而我的不信任中医是极其荒谬幼稚的。
    总而言之，通过这次视察和参加了这次会议于我的改造都是有极大的帮助的。一九五七年以前我无论是参加视察看甚么事物或参加会议看什么文件，都觉得有许多问题要提一些意见，其实那时是站在反动的立场用旧的观点看问题。因此我所提的意见是错误、是反动的。现在就恰恰相反了，看不出甚么问题，即使发现一些个别的、极微小的缺点，也会理解得到这是在全面大跃进中难以避免的，早已为领导党或负责同志所了解到注意到的，在党全国一盘棋指导之下，群众无穷智慧一定能够迅速解决的。我对于一九五九年的全面继续大跃进具有十二万分的信心，但改造的程度还差得很远。我唯有不断的更加努力的改造，永远在党的领导下追随前进，庶不辜负党宽大处理的深厚意义。
