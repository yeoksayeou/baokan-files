Comrade Zhu De, dear friends, comrades:
    On behalf of the delegation of the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic, I express my heartfelt thanks for your invitation and the warm reception you have given us.
    We have come to the People's Republic of China to learn in detail about the great achievements made by the Chinese working people in socialist construction during the Great Leap Forward last year. These almost impossible achievements amaze, gladden, and make us proud. We are amazed by the creativity displayed by the Chinese people under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, and our joy comes from our fraternal feelings for the Chinese people.
    Dear comrades, we, like you, are pleased with such great achievements last year, and we are proud because, as members of the socialist family headed by the Soviet Union, we have a country like the People's Republic of China and a people like the Chinese people as our friends and supporters. Everyone understands that the strength of the People's Republic of China means a great strengthening of the socialist camp led by the Soviet Union and an important contribution to the defense of world peace.
    Maintaining peace in Asia and Europe is the main issue of our current policy, and the peaceful settlement of the German question plays a decisive role in this regard. As you all know, there are two German states today. The war has ended fourteen years ago but a peace treaty has not been signed. The Western occupying powers have violated the terms of the Potsdam Agreement and have not done anything to eradicate German imperialism and militarism and to transform Germany into a peace-loving and democratic country. On the contrary, they have actively helped the resurgence of West German imperialism and militarism, they have actively supported the militarization and war policies promoted by the West German revanchist forces, and they are preparing a new war under the guise of anti-communism together with German imperialism. They have used the old militarist and fascist forces and controlled the state organs. They have long since gained a leading position in West Germany today and have also gained an important position in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
  Therefore, the German Democratic Republic, uniting all socialist and peace-loving countries, has resolutely opposed the threat of war from American and German imperialism. On the basis of the Soviet proposal, the signing of a peace treaty with Germany would restrain German militarism and create a decisive prerequisite for the peaceful and democratic reunification of the two Germanys. This would greatly ease the tensions in Europe. Therefore, the German people strongly demand that the upcoming Geneva Four Foreign Ministers' Conference, which is well known to have representatives from both Germanys, make such a resolution: that a summit meeting and a peace conference to sign a peace treaty with Germany be convened subsequently. Although all these proposals are reasonable, realistic, and in the interests of all peace-loving people, they are still rejected by the Bonn militarists and Adenauer, because signing a peace treaty with Germany would doom the revanchist plans of these warmongers to failure. However, the international situation has changed, and the last representative of the brinkmanship policy, US Secretary of State Dulles, must leave the government, and Adenauer will not remain in the government for long either. This means that the forces of peace are growing stronger, and there is no doubt that we will be the victors in this struggle.
    The German Democratic Republic has set the goal in this struggle to develop the national economy in a few years in order to prove the complete superiority of the socialist system over the capitalist system, so that in 1961 the consumption of living and consumer goods per person will exceed that of West Germany. This is the goal of our main economic task and also a contribution of the German Democratic Republic in the world-wide struggle for peaceful coexistence and peaceful competition between the socialist and capitalist social systems. I would like to express my fraternal gratitude to the Chinese comrades and the entire Chinese people for their selfless assistance and support in this struggle.
    I propose a toast:
    To the new great achievements made by the Chinese people in building socialism,
    To the further consolidation and deepening of the fraternal relations between the German Democratic Republic and the People's Republic of China,
    To the happiness and health of Comrade Mao Zedong, Comrade Liu Shaoqi, Comrade Zhu De, and all other leading comrades of the People's Republic of China,
    To the unity of the socialist camp,
    To the maintenance of world peace!

### 马特恩副主席的讲话

专栏：

    马特恩副主席的讲话敬爱的朱德同志，亲爱的朋友们，同志们：
    我代表德意志民主共和国人民议院代表团对你们的邀请和给予我们的热烈接待表示衷心的感谢。
    我们到中华人民共和国来的目的是为了详细地了解中国劳动人民在去年大跃进的一年中和社会主义建设中所取得的伟大成就。这些几乎不可能取得的成就使我们感到惊奇、高兴和骄傲。我们对中国人民在中国共产党的英明领导下所发挥出来的创造力感到惊奇，我们的高兴来自于我们对中国人民的兄弟感情。
    亲爱的同志们，我们和你们一样对去年取得的这种伟大成就感到高兴，我们感到骄傲，因为我们作为社会主义各国大家庭的一员，有了像中华人民共和国那样的国家和像中国人民那样的人民作为我们的朋友和支援者。每个人都了解，中华人民共和国的强大就意味着大大地加强了由苏联领导的社会主义阵营，意味着对保卫世界和平作出了重要的贡献。
    维护亚洲和欧洲的和平是我们当前政策的主要问题，和平解决德国问题在这方面起了一个决定性的作用。你们都知道，今天在德国存在着两个国家。战争已结束十四年但还没有签订对德和约。西方占领国破坏了波茨坦协定的条款，并至今没有对铲除德国帝国主义和军国主义以及把德国变成为一个爱好和平和民主的国家作出任何事情，相反地，他们积极地帮助了西德帝国主义和军国主义的再起，他们积极地支持了由西德的复仇主义势力所推行的军国主义化和战争政策，并和德国帝国主义一起在反对共产主义的伪装下准备一次新的战争，他们利用了旧的军国主义和法西斯的力量，控制了国家机关，他们今天早已在西德获得了领导的地位，并且也在北大西洋公约组织中取得了重要的地位。
  因此，德意志民主共和国联合了一切社会主义和爱好和平的国家坚决地进行了反对来自于美国和德国帝国主义的战争威胁。在苏联的建议的基础上签订对德和约，这样会约制德国军国主义并为两个德国的和平和民主的重新统一创造了决定性的前提。这样会使欧洲的紧张局势大大缓和。因此，德国人民强烈要求即将召开的，众所周知的有两个德国派代表参加的日内瓦四大国外长会议作出这样的决议：即随后召开最高首脑会议和签订对德和约的和平会议。虽然所有这些建议是合理的现实的并且符合一切爱好和平的人民的利益，可是这些建议仍旧被波恩军国主义分子和阿登纳拒绝了，因为签订对德和约将会注定这些战争贩子的复仇主义计划趋向失败。可是国际局势起了变化，战争边缘政策的最后的代表者美国国务卿杜勒斯必须离开政府，阿登纳也不会再长期地留在政府里面。这就是说，和平的力量日益强大，毫无疑问，我们将是这次斗争的胜利者。
    德意志民主共和国在这次斗争中提出目标，在几年内发展国民经济，以便证明社会主义社会制度对资本主义社会制度的完全优越性，使得在1961年每人的生活和消费品的消费额超过西德。这是我们主要经济任务的目标，也是德意志民主共和国在社会主义和资本主义社会制度的和平共处和和平竞赛的世界性的斗争中所作的一份贡献。我愿意对于中国同志和全中国人民在这次斗争中给予我们的无私的援助和支持表示兄弟般的感谢。
    我建议为中国人民在建设社会主义方面所取得的新的伟大成就，
    为德意志民主共和国和中华人民共和国之间的兄弟关系的进一步巩固和加深，
    为毛泽东同志，刘少奇同志，朱德同志和中华人民共和国所有的其它的领导同志幸福和健康，
    为社会主义阵营的团结一致，
    为维护全世界的和平，
    干杯！
