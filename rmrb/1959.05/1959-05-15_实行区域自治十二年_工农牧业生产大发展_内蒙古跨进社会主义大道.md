    Twelve Years of Regional Autonomy: Great Development in Industry, Agriculture, and Animal Husbandry
    Inner Mongolia Strides onto the Socialist Path

    (By Our Correspondent) This year, May 1st marks the twelfth anniversary of the founding of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. Over the past twelve years, under the brilliant illumination of the Party's ethnic policies, the people of all ethnic groups in Inner Mongolia have achieved tremendous accomplishments, fundamentally changing the face of the Autonomous Region.

    Before Liberation, the working people of all ethnic groups in Inner Mongolia suffered the cruel oppression and exploitation by imperialism, domestic reactionaries, and internal reactionary forces, living the life of slaves. After the establishment of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region on May 1, 1947, a new page was opened in the history of the people of all ethnic groups in Inner Mongolia. The situation in which the Mongolian people were divided for more than 300 years has ended forever. The Mongolian people and other ethnic minorities such as the Oroqen, Ewenki, and Daur truly enjoy the right to be masters of their own affairs and have become the masters of their own destiny. During this period, Inner Mongolia carried out democratic reforms, eliminated the backward, reactionary, and cruel feudal system, and restored and developed various productions. In the Great Leap Forward last year, the rural and pastoral areas realized the people's commune system, which made the various production and construction undertakings develop rapidly. From the establishment of the Autonomous Region to the end of 1958, the total industrial and agricultural output value of Inner Mongolia increased more than four times. In the past, Inner Mongolia, which was "unarmed," produced more than 80,000 tons of iron and more than 10,000 tons of steel last year, ending the history of not producing iron and steel. Before Liberation, Inner Mongolia, which had almost no industry, has now established various types of factories and mines, which have strongly supported the agricultural and animal husbandry production of the Autonomous Region. Grain production has also increased 2.4 times, and a large amount of surplus grain is provided to fraternal regions and national construction every year. The animal husbandry economy, on which the Mongolian people depended for their survival in history, has increased nearly two times in these years, reaching more than 24 million heads, ranking first in the country.

    In order to help herdsmen vigorously develop livestock and carry out construction, in the eight years before 1957, the state allocated loans equivalent to 140,000 taels of gold. Now, more than 100 economic centers have been built on the grasslands of Inner Mongolia. Most herdsmen have changed their past painful lives of "living by water and grass" and built happy homes in their settled areas. The Baotou Iron and Steel Industrial Base, one of the three major iron and steel industrial bases in the country, which marks the rapid development and prosperity of the Autonomous Region, will soon be built in Inner Mongolia, which has laid a solid foundation for the economic development of the Autonomous Region. In the ancient Greater Khingan Mountains, the young forest industry is also developing rapidly, and a large number of high-quality timber is continuously sent to all parts of the country. At present, a large-scale struggle to transform the desert and conquer nature has begun in the vast desert area of Inner Mongolia. Before long, a beautiful picture of "turning the borderland into an oasis and turning the desert into fertile land" will appear in front of the people of all ethnic groups in Inner Mongolia.

    The tremendous development of industrial, agricultural, and animal husbandry production in the Autonomous Region has rapidly improved and enhanced the material and cultural life of the people of all ethnic groups. From the establishment of the Autonomous Region to the end of 1958, the purchasing power of the people in urban and rural areas of the whole region increased by four and a half times, and the average per capita grain possession was more than 1,200 jin. A life of abundance has replaced the suffering days before Liberation. At the same time, the number of primary school students in Inner Mongolia has increased more than four times, the number of middle school students has increased nineteen times, and institutions of higher learning have developed from scratch to eighteen. Diseases that have seriously threatened the people of all ethnic groups for hundreds of years have now been basically controlled or eliminated, and the Autonomous Region presents a prosperous scene of "thriving population." The Mongolian population, which had been declining sharply before Liberation, increased by more than 300,000 from the establishment of the Autonomous Region to 1958, an increase of 36%.

    Since the establishment of the Autonomous Region, relying on the leadership and help of many veteran Han cadres, various schools and training courses have been established to train a large number of ethnic minority cadres. In the first ten years after the establishment of the Autonomous Region alone, the whole region trained 130,000 cadres of all ethnic groups. These cadres have become the backbone of various tasks in the Autonomous Region, and many have taken up leadership positions. In recent years, they have conscientiously implemented the Party's ethnic policies, widely united the people of all ethnic groups, and made great contributions to the construction of the Autonomous Region.

    Under the leadership of the Party, the people of all ethnic groups in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region have resolutely embarked on the broad road of socialism for the past twelve years. In the early days of Liberation, they crushed the conspiracy of a small handful of Mongolian upper-class reactionaries who attempted to split Inner Mongolia from the big family of the motherland. The victorious people of all ethnic groups in Inner Mongolia deeply understand that the leadership of the Party, the unification of the motherland, and the unity and cooperation of all ethnic groups centered on the Han nationality are not only the basic guarantees for the development and prosperity of all ethnic groups, but also the common supreme interests of the people of all ethnic groups.

    实行区域自治十二年　工农牧业生产大发展
    内蒙古跨进社会主义大道
    本报讯　今年5月1日是内蒙古自治区成立十二周年。十二年来，内蒙古各族人民，在党的民族政策的光辉照耀下，取得了巨大成就，使自治区的面貌根本改观。
    解放前，内蒙古各族劳动人民饱尝了帝国主义、国内反动派和民族内部反动势力的残酷压迫和剥削，过着牛马般的奴隶生活，1947年5月1日，内蒙古自治区成立后，内蒙古各族人民的历史揭开了新的一页。蒙古民族三百多年被分割的局面，已经永远结束，蒙古民族和鄂伦春、鄂温克、达斡尔等其他少数民族真正享受了当家作主的权利，成了自己命运的主人。在此期间，内蒙古进行了民主改革，消灭了落后、反动和残酷的封建制度，恢复和发展了各项生产。在去年的大跃进中，又实现了农村和牧区的人民公社化，使各项生产建设事业飞跃发展。从自治区成立到1958年底，内蒙古的工农业产值增加了四倍以上。过去“手无寸铁”的内蒙古，去年已生产了八万多吨铁、一万多吨钢，结束了不产钢铁的历史。解放前几乎没有工业的内蒙古，现在已建立起各种类型的厂矿，有力地支援了自治区农牧业生产。粮食生产也增加了二点四倍，每年都以大量余粮支援兄弟地区和祖国建设。历史上蒙古民族赖以生存的畜牧业经济，在这些年中增加了将近两倍，达到二千四百多万头，居全国首位。
    为了帮助牧民大力发展牲畜和进行建设，在1957年前的八年中。国家拨出相当于十四万两黄金的贷款。现在内蒙古草原上已建设起一百多个经济中心点。大部分牧民已经改变了过去“逐水草而居”的痛苦生活，在定居地上建起了幸福家园。标志着自治区迅速发展和繁荣的全国三大钢铁工业基地之一的包头钢铁工业基地，即将在内蒙古兴建起来，这为自治区的经济发展奠定了坚实的基础。在古老的大兴安岭上，年轻的森林工业也正在飞跃发展，并将大批优质木材源源送往祖国各地。目前一个大规模改造沙漠的征服自然的斗争，又在内蒙古广阔的沙漠地带开始了。不会很久，一个“塞外成绿洲、沙漠变良田”的美好景象，将出现在内蒙古各族人民的面前。
    自治区内工农牧业生产的巨大发展，迅速改善和提高了各族人民的物质和文化生活。从自治区成立到1958年底，全区城乡人民的购买力提高了四倍半，每人平均占有粮食量一千二百多斤，丰衣足食的生活已代替了解放前的苦难日子。同时内蒙古的小学生增加了四倍多，中学生增加了十九倍，高等学校从无到有，目前已发展到十八所。几百年来严重威胁各族人民的疾病，现已基本控制或消灭，自治区到处呈现了“人丁兴旺”的繁荣景象。解放前人口急剧下降的蒙古民族，从自治区成立到1958年增加了三十多万人，增长了36％。
    自治区成立以来，依靠许多汉族老干部的领导和帮助，先后开办了各种学校、训练班，培养了大批民族干部。仅在自治区成立后的头十年中，全区就培养了各族干部十三万人。这些干部已成为自治区各项工作的骨干，有许多人已担任了领导工作。几年来，他们认真贯彻执行了党的民族政策，广泛团结了各族人民，为自治区的建设作出了巨大贡献。
    内蒙古自治区各族人民，十二年来在党的领导下，坚决地走上了社会主义的康庄大道。并在解放初期，击垮了一小撮蒙古族上层反动分子企图把内蒙古从祖国大家庭里分裂出去的阴谋活动。胜利了的内蒙古各族人民深深懂得：党的领导、祖国的统一和以汉族为中心的各民族的团结合作，不仅是各民族得以发展和繁荣的基本保证，也是各族人民共同的最高利益。
