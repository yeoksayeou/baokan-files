How to Select Seeds

Now is the summer harvest seed selection season. The following introduces several commonly used seed selection methods for local reference.

Spike Selection: Also known as ear selection or "diao" selection. Suitable for wheat crops during the summer harvest season. It involves selecting wheat ears with the same shape and good growth based on the characteristics of the wheat variety, and threshing them separately for use as seeds. There are two types of spike selection methods: field selection and threshing ground selection.

	1. Field Spike Selection: Two or three days before harvest, in the wheat field (seed field), select mature wheat ears from the growing wheat ears according to the ear shape of the variety for seed retention. This method is relatively meticulous, ensuring that the seeds are fully mature and have strong germination, and can quickly and effectively improve variety purity. However, it requires more manual labor and is generally used when selecting a small number of seeds, such as for propagating new varieties or selecting seeds for seed fields.
	2. Threshing Ground Spike Selection: When there is not enough time to select ears in the field, this method involves selecting wheat ears from the wheat bundles stored in the threshing ground for seed retention. It is a remedial method for field spike selection.

Plant Selection: Also known as stalk selection. Suitable for crops such as rapeseed and broad beans. The method and effect are similar to spike selection, which involves selecting good plants in the field for seed retention. This method allows for observation of plant growth in the field and selection based on the characteristics of the variety. For example, selecting rapeseed plants with many branches, dense pods, long pods with many grains, and free from diseases and pests for seed retention. Generally, before harvest, experienced commune members observe the plant shape in the field and select plants that meet the standards for seed retention. Then, all are harvested. Plant selection mostly uses the method of selecting and harvesting at the same time, and the selected single plants are harvested together, dried, and threshed separately for seed retention.

Pod Selection: Suitable for crops such as broad beans. In order to improve seed quality, seeds for seed fields can be further subjected to pod selection based on plant selection, selecting large grains with many grains for use as seeds to further improve seed germination rate and purity.

Block Selection: Also known as patch selection. In the absence of established seed fields, a block (or patch) of crops with uniform growth and high variety purity is selected from the large field or high-yield field before harvest, and all are harvested separately for seed retention. This method is relatively crude, because the selected block (or patch) of crops inevitably contains bad single plants, single ears, or even different varieties. Therefore, the effect of improving variety purity is small. When the variety purity is high, and there is no established seed field, but a large amount of seeds needs to be selected, this method can be used for seed retention.

    怎样选种
    现在正是夏收选种季节，下面介绍几种常用的选种方法，供各地参考。
    穗选：也叫吊选，刁选。夏收季节，适用在麦类作物上。就是根据麦子品种的特征、特性，把形状相同、生长良好的麦穗选拔出来，单独脱粒作种。其中又有田间和场上两种穗选方法。
    1、田间穗选：收获前两三天，在麦田（种子地）里，从生长着的麦穗中，按照本品种的麦穗形状，挑选成熟的留种。这种方法比较细致，不仅能保证种子充分成熟，发芽力强，更可迅速有效地提高品种纯度。但是需用人工较多，一般选留种子数量较少的时候，如繁殖新品种、选留种子地（田）所用的种子，都采用这种方法。2、场上穗选：来不及在田（地）里选穗的时候，从场院堆存的麦捆里挑选麦穗留种的方法。是田间穗选的补救方法。
    株选：也叫棵选。适用在油菜、蚕豆等作物上。方法与效果都和穗选差不多，就是在田（地）里挑选好的植株留种。这种方法，可以根据品种的特征、特性、在田（地）里观察植株生长情况进行选择。如从生长着的油菜中挑选分枝多、结荚密、荚长粒多、无病虫害的植株留种。一般在收获前，先由有经验的社员到田间观察植株形状，挑选合乎标准的植株留种。然后再全部收获。株选时大都采用边选、边收的办法，把入选的单株收割在一起晒干后，单独脱粒留种。
    荚选：适用蚕豆等作物上。为了提高种子品质，选留种子地（田）所用的种子，可以在株选的基础上再进行荚选，选出粒大而多的作种，进一步提高种子发芽率和纯度。
    块选：也叫片选。在没有建立种子地（田）的情况下，收获以前从在大田或丰产田里挑选一块（或一片）生长整齐、品种纯度较高的庄稼，全部单独收割留种，这种方法比较粗糙，因为选中的一块（或一片）庄稼里，难免夹杂着不好的单株、单穗，甚至不同的品种。因而提高品种纯度的效果较小。在品种纯度较高，没有建立种子地（田）又需要选留较多量的种子时，可以采用这种方法留种。
