Close Planting

Crop Breeding and Cultivation Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences

Close planting is central to increasing crop yields

The practice of high yields in agriculture in 1958 not only powerfully shattered the theory of sparse planting but also greatly exceeded the original density "limit." In the past, rice was transplanted at only 10,000 to 20,000 holes per mu, approximately 100,000 to 200,000 seedlings. Some believed that exceeding this density would result in limited yield increases or even yield reductions. However, in 1958, various regions, based on deep plowing and increased fertilization, transplanted rice seedlings at densities of 30,000 to 50,000 holes per mu, 250,000 to 400,000 seedlings. With strengthened field management, significant yield increases were achieved. For example, in Anhui Province, early double-cropping rice was transplanted at approximately 33,000 holes per mu, over 300,000 seedlings, about double that of 1957, achieving a yield of 1,000 jin per mu across the province. In the past, winter wheat was generally sown at around 6 to 15 jin per mu. Some believed that each mu should not exceed 500,000 ears. However, in 1958, the sixteen high-yield fields nationwide with yields of over 2,000 jin per mu had an average sowing rate of 23 jin; the forty-three fields with yields of over 1,000 jin had an average sowing rate of 19.5 jin. These high-yield fields exceeded 500,000 ears per mu. In the past, spring corn generally had about 2,000 plants per mu; in 1958, high-yield fields with yields of over 1,000 jin per mu mostly had 3,000 to 4,000 plants. Peanuts were previously planted at 3,500 to 4,000 holes per mu, approximately 10,000 plants; in 1958, large-area high-yield fields with yields of over 1,000 jin per mu often planted 6,000 to 7,000 holes, approximately 20,000 plants (the variety being a bunch-type large peanut). All these facts further affirmed the potential of close planting to increase yields and clarified the importance of focusing on close planting to promote the forward development of other yield-increasing technologies.

Why close planting can increase yields: effectively utilizing light energy, fully utilizing soil fertility

The purpose of crop cultivation is to obtain the maximum amount of effective products we need from a unit area of land, and rational close planting is the central link in achieving this goal. Crop products are created by green plants effectively utilizing sunlight, air, and nutrients in the soil. Research has proven that 90%–95% of crop dry matter (the main component of effective products) is organic matter, of which nine-tenths are products of photosynthesis. The amount of photosynthetic products is determined by the efficiency of crop photosynthesis and the photosynthetic area (mainly leaf area size) and time. Therefore, under certain cultivation environment conditions, rational close planting can increase leaf area and effectively utilize light energy. According to wheat research data, the leaf area gradually increases from seedling emergence to the end of tillering, with the maximum leaf area occurring at the end of the tillering period. Later, due to the death of late-emerging tillers, the leaf area actually decreases. Under rational close planting, the leaf area per unit area of land is always greater than with sparse planting. Correspondingly, the amount of plant dry matter per unit area of land is also higher with close planting, thus achieving higher yields. Secondly, the mineral nutrients and water needed by plants are mainly taken from the soil. Rational close planting, due to the increased number of plants per unit area and their even distribution, can fully utilize soil fertility. Under rational close planting conditions, combined with deep plowing and layered fertilization, the nutrient area of the root system can be expanded accordingly.

Controlling ineffective tillering and increasing the main spike rate

The characteristic of rational close planting in the above-ground parts of cereal crops is that it is conducive to controlling ineffective tillering, significantly increasing the effective tillering rate and main spike rate per plant, and correspondingly increasing the total number of spikes and main spikes per unit area, achieving uniform spikes, large spikes, many grains, and early and consistent maturity. This is because the relationship between individual cereal crops is regulated by the tillering characteristics. In the case of sparse planting, tillering increases per plant, the tillering period is prolonged, early and late tillers cannot develop evenly, leading to uneven spike sizes, and a large number of ineffective tillers are easily formed if conditions are slightly unsuitable. In the case of rational close planting, appropriate tillering per plant can be controlled, and tillering is neat and concentrated, with consistent heading and maturity, reducing ineffective tillering and increasing the number of effective tillers and the proportion of main spikes. For example, a survey of spring wheat density trials at the Delingha Farm in Qinghai Province in 1958 showed that the number of spikes per square meter for sowing rates of 28 jin, 32 jin, 36 jin, and 40 jin per mu were 910, 908, 944, and 998, respectively. The main spike rates were 52.1%, 62.9%, 71.6%, and 75.8%, respectively. The number of ineffective tillers per plant was 0.62, 0.61, 0.43, and 0.46, respectively. The difference in the number of grains per spike between main stems and tillers was not significant among the treatments, but the number of grains per spike in the main stems was significantly higher than that in the tillers in all treatments. Close planting resulted in increased yields due to the high number of spikes and high main spike rate per unit area. The yields were 815.5 jin, 869.7 jin, 931.8 jin, and 1012.8 jin per mu, respectively. This shows that close planting controlled ineffective tillering, increased the number of main spikes, and achieved high yields. For other crops, such as peanuts, close planting can inhibit the development of ineffective branches and reduce the number of empty pods. Close planting of cotton increases the number of fruit branch nodes near the main stem. These fruit branch nodes produce more bolls and mature earlier. These are all beneficial factors for increasing yields.

Reducing ground evaporation and rationally utilizing soil moisture

The role of close planting also lies in increasing shade, reducing vacant ground, and protecting the soil from direct sunlight and dry wind erosion, thereby reducing the direct evaporation of soil moisture from the ground. According to data measured by the former North China Agricultural Science Research Institute on soil moisture evaporation in wheat fields with different row spacings, the soil moisture evaporation in narrow rows was less than that in wide rows from the seedling stage, jointing stage, and maturity stage, and there was a trend that the narrower the row spacing, the smaller the soil moisture evaporation. Compared with row spacings of 2.25 inches and 18 inches, the soil moisture evaporation in the latter was about twice that of the former during the jointing, heading, and flowering stages. These are the periods when wheat needs the most water, and the total water demand will increase accordingly after close planting. However, due to the reduction of ground evaporation, it is beneficial for wheat to effectively and economically utilize soil moisture.

Suppressing weeds and mitigating disasters

In addition, due to increased shading after close planting, weed growth is also suppressed. At the same time, due to the large ground coverage and the less abrupt changes in the field microclimate conditions, damage from wind and frost can also be reduced. According to investigations in various regions, wheat plants in closely planted fields are close to each other, and the stems and leaves are close together, which can reduce or block the heat dissipation of the air near the ground at night. The cold air entering the closely planted fields is also not easy to circulate between the plants, thus reducing frost damage. Materials obtained from a survey of spring frost damage in Fenyang, Shanxi Province on April 20, 1954, showed that the stem freezing rate of wheat in closely planted fields was 38.6%, while the freezing rate in sparsely planted fields was 69.1%.

Close planting must be coordinated with other technical measures

Although close planting is the center of increasing crop yields, it must be closely integrated with other technical measures to achieve yield-increasing results. Practice shows that close planting does indeed bring some new problems or contradictions, but as long as the "Eight-Character Charter" is conscientiously implemented, these contradictions can be overcome. The primary problem after close planting is to ensure that plants are well-fed and hydrated. Although close planting can fully utilize the ground and space, it cannot function properly if there is a lack of nutrients and water. With the increase in density, fertilization and irrigation must be increased accordingly. Therefore, in order to ensure the normal development of wheat after close planting, tillage and fertilization techniques based on deep plowing and combined with layered application of base fertilizer are very important. One of the reasons why people opposed close planting in the past was that they believed that the spikes would become smaller and the number of grains would decrease after close planting. This phenomenon exists. However, under rational close planting conditions, the increase in the number of spikes per unit area is always greater than the decrease in the number of grains, and the number of grains per spike does not decrease when water and fertilizer conditions are coordinated. According to a survey of forty-eight single-cropping late rice fields in Changshu County, Jiangsu Province in 1958, those with 250,000 spikes per mu had 67.03 grains per spike, and those with 300,000 spikes had 67.17 grains. The number of spikes in the latter increased by 50,000, and the number of grains per spike did not decrease. Those with 350,000 spikes had 62.46 grains, and those with 700,000 spikes had 59.86 grains. The number of spikes in the latter doubled, while the number of grains per spike only decreased by 2.6 grains, or 4.2%. This is the result of deep plowing and sufficient fertilizer. Sufficient fertilization after close planting, especially timely topdressing to promote spike and grain development, has a greater effect on increasing the number of grains per spike. Secondly, the biggest concern about close planting is the problem of lodging. In fact, the main causes of lodging are shallow plowing, improper fertilization and irrigation, or poor coordination of cultivation management. A survey of rice in 1958 showed that by deepening the tillage layer, adopting measures such as layered application of sufficient base fertilizer, less frequent topdressing, shallow water activation of seedlings, moist irrigation, and timely drying of the field, lodging can be prevented under rational close planting. For wheat, combining deep plowing with sufficient base fertilizer, applying nitrogen fertilizer in appropriate amounts in stages according to seedling conditions, applying phosphorus and potassium fertilizer in early spring, appropriately controlling the water at the jointing stage, and mastering the irrigation methods of watching the weather, watching the land, and watching the crops are all effective ways to prevent lodging. In addition, improving sowing methods to facilitate ventilation and light transmission, and selecting strong-stemmed and high-quality varieties are important measures to prevent lodging and ensure high yields.

Close planting is not the denser the better

The yield-increasing effect of close planting is certain, but it cannot be understood as the denser the better. Under certain cultivation conditions, a reasonable density should be determined, and it should also be pointed out that the density of various crops has reasonable limits. The so-called rational close planting is to increase the number of plants per unit area, and to ensure that healthy plants are obtained, so as to achieve full and strong seedlings, many and large spikes, and many and full grains. Under certain cultivation conditions, exceeding the appropriate density range will lead to yield reduction. In the past, there were many instances of yield reduction in close planting cultivation of various crops. There are roughly two situations: one is that other measures were not followed up after close planting, and the other is that the sowing amount was blindly increased, causing the plants to be too crowded, seriously affecting the normal growth of individual plants. This situation has already occurred in some high-yield winter wheat experimental fields this year, and we should take this as a warning. According to the survey conducted by various research institutions in the autumn of 1958 on the seedling stage of winter wheat high-yield experimental fields, when the sowing density per mu exceeded 1.5 million seeds (about 100 jin of seeds), many characteristic traits indicating the seedling stage growth status had obvious changes. The most significant features are that the seedlings are elongated, the number of tillers per plant, the number of primary roots and secondary roots are reduced, the percentage of tillering plants and the percentage of plants with secondary roots are significantly reduced, the rate of weak seedlings is increased, and the sugar content and dry weight of individual plants are sharply reduced. According to the situation we learned in the southern wheat areas in March and April, it seems a bit too dense when the number of seedlings per mu exceeds 600,000, and it is prone to elongation and lodging. The main reason for the poor growth of plants after being too dense is poor light and nutrition, which seriously weakens the intensity of photosynthesis and is not conducive to accumulating nutrients. According to the recent investigation results in the wheat areas of Guangdong, Yunnan, Sichuan and other provinces, we preliminarily believe that the performance of 600,000 to 800,000 spikes per mu is better. It is definitely not the denser the better. This should be noted.

Principles for determining the degree of close planting of crops

When determining the degree of close planting of crops, not only should the differences between different types of crops be noted, but also the differences in the degree of close planting suitable for the same crop due to the differences in climate, soil fertility, and cultivation conditions in different regions, as well as different variety types. Generally speaking, crops that use tillering force to regulate the relationship between individuals, such as wheat and rice, have a larger limit for close planting. On the other hand, crops that do not have tillering characteristics but have branching characteristics, such as beans and cotton, have a smaller degree of close planting. Tall crops or cultivated crops also have a smaller density, such as corn, sorghum, and potatoes. According to the same crop, the density of varieties with strong tillering ability should be smaller, and vice versa. Early-maturing types can be denser, and late-maturing types can be sparser. The density of varieties with compact and erect plant types can be larger, and the density of varieties with sprawling and procumbent plant types should be smaller. In the southern regions with higher temperatures and more rainfall, the density should be smaller, and in the northern regions with lower temperatures and less rainfall, the density can be larger (the density is smaller in areas without irrigation conditions or poor soil fertility). The density of early sowing should be smaller, and the density of late sowing should be larger. In addition, the quality of land preparation, soil moisture conditions, underground pests, seed quality, and the impact of sowing quality on seedling emergence should also be considered when sowing, so as to appropriately adjust the sowing amount. Of course, the increase in labor required to strengthen field management after close planting should also be considered. In short, there are many factors affecting the degree of close planting, and they should be flexibly mastered and specifically arranged according to specific conditions, and should not be copied mechanically.

Correspondingly improve sowing methods

With the increase in density, the sowing method must also be improved accordingly. According to the materials currently available in our institute, wheat should be sown in strips as evenly as possible with the smallest possible row spacing. Wide-strip sowing is also an effective method. However, the strip width is generally 4 to 6 inches, and the strip spacing is 3 to 4 inches. The experience of rice shows that under close planting conditions, the single-row strip planting method is better, which is conducive to ventilation, light transmission, and moisture drainage, and is also conducive to the implementation of various field management operations. Adopting the method of wide and narrow rows (or large and small ridges) with unequal row spacing is also more suitable for close planting of corn. The experience of sweet potatoes shows that the method of high ridge double-row staggered planting is better. The ridge spacing is 3-3.5 feet, and two rows are planted on each ridge, with a plant spacing of 0.6-1.0 feet, and a small row spacing of 0.5-1.4 feet. When narrowing the row spacing of cultivated crops, the convenience of cultivation, soil cultivation, and management should be appropriately considered. In short, close planting has indeed brought many problems, but the experience of increasing yields of various crops by close planting in 1958 tells us that as long as we grasp the laws of crop growth and development and implement rational close planting, these problems can be solved.

    密植是农作物增产的中心
    1958年农业方面高额丰产的实践，不但有力地打破了稀植论，也大大地突破了原有的密度“极限”。水稻过去每亩只插一、二万穴，约十万至二十万苗。有人认为超过这个密度即增产有限，或有减产趋势。但1958年各地在深耕、增肥的基础上，插秧密度多达三万至五万穴，二十五万至四十万苗。由于加强了田间管理，都获得了显著的增产效果。如安徽全省双季早稻每亩插秧约三万三千穴，三十多万苗，比1957年增加约一倍，实现了千斤省。冬小麦过去每亩播种量一般在六斤至十五斤左右。有人认为每亩不能超过五十万穗。但1958年全国亩产二千斤以上的十六块丰产田，平均播种量为二十三斤；一千斤以上的四十三块，平均播种量为十九点五斤。这些丰产田每亩多超过五十万穗以上。春玉米过去一般每亩留二千株左右，1958年亩产千斤以上的丰产田，多在三千至四千株。花生过去每亩种三千五百至四千穴，约一万株，1958年亩产千斤以上的大面积丰产田，多种六千至七千穴，二万株左右（品种为丛生型大花生）。所有这些事实，进一步肯定了密植增产的潜力，并明确了以密植为中心，从而促进其他各项增产技术向前发展的重要性。
    密植为什么能够增产有效地利用光能，充分利用地力
    农作物栽培的目的是要在单位面积的土地上，最大限度地获得我们所需要的有效产品，而合理密植是实现这个目的的中心环节。农作物产品是通过绿色植物体有效地利用日光能、空气和土壤中的营养物质造成的。研究证明：农作物干物量（组成有效产品的主要部分）的90％—95％是有机物质，其中十分之九是光合作用造成的产品。而光合作用产物的多少，是受作物光合效率大小及光合作用面积（主要是叶面积大小）与时间所支配的。因此在一定的栽培环境条件下，合理密植可以增加叶面积，有效地利用光能。根据小麦的研究资料，自幼苗出土至分蘖停止，叶面积逐渐增加，以分蘖停止期为叶面积最大时期。以后由于后生分蘖的死亡，叶面积反而下降。在合理密植下，单位面积土地上叶面积始终是大于稀植的。与此相适应的是单位土地面积内的植物干物量也是以密植的为高，因而能获得较高的产量。其次，植物所需的矿物质养料及水分等主要是取自地下，合理密植由于单位面积内株数增多，且均匀分布，可以充分利用地力。在合理密植的情况下，结合深耕、分层施肥，可以相应地扩大了根系的营养面积。
    控制无效分蘖　增加主穗率
    合理密植表现在禾谷类作物地上部植株生育的特点是：有利于控制无效分蘖，单株有效分蘖率和主穗率都显著提高，单位面积内的总穗数和主穗数也相应地增多，并且达到穗齐、穗大、粒多、成熟早而一致。这是因为各种禾谷类作物个体间的关系是依靠分蘖的特性来调节的。在稀植的情况下，单株的分蘖增多，分蘖期延长，早晚分蘖不能均衡发展，以致穗子大小不齐，条件稍有不适，就容易形成大量的无效分蘖。在合理密植的情况下，能控制单株的适当分蘖，且分蘖整齐集中，抽穗成熟一致，减少了无效分蘖，提高了有效分蘖数及主穗比重。例如1958年青海省德令哈农场春小麦密度试验调查，每亩播二十八斤、三十二斤、三十六斤、四十斤的平方公尺穗数依次为九百一十、九百零八、九百四十四、九百九十八个。主穗率依次为52.1％、62.9％、71.6％、75.8％。单株无效分蘖数依次为零点六二、零点六一、零点四三、零点四六。各处理间主茎穗或分蘖穗结实粒数的差异不显，但处理内主茎穗的结实粒数均显著多于分蘖穗。密植的由于单位面积内的穗数及主穗率均高，因而获得了增产。产量依次为每亩八百一十五点五斤、八百六十九点七斤、九百三十一点八斤、一千零一十二点八斤。由此可见密植后控制了无效分蘖，增加了主穗，获得了丰产。其他作物如花生密植后可以抑制无效分枝的着生，秕果数减少。棉花密植后增加了靠近主茎的果枝节。这种果枝节结铃多，成熟早。这些都是增产的有利因素。减弱地面蒸发，合理利用土壤水分
    密植的作用还在于增加荫蔽，减少了空闲地面，使土壤少受阳光直射和旱风侵袭，从而减弱土壤水分直接自地面的蒸发。据前华北农业科学研究所测定不同行距的小麦田内土壤水分蒸发量的资料表明，自幼苗、拔节以至成熟各期，窄行的土壤水分蒸发量都比宽行的少，且有行距愈窄土壤水分蒸发量愈小的趋势。行距二点二五寸与十八寸相较，在拔节、抽穗、开花各期土壤水分蒸发量后者为前者的二倍左右。这几个时期小麦对水分需要最殷，且密植后总的需水量将相应地增加，但由于地面蒸发量减少，对小麦有效地、经济地利用土壤水分当然是有利的。
    抑制杂草　减轻灾害
    此外，由于密植后增加荫蔽，也抑制了杂草的生长。同时由于地面复盖面大、田间小气候条件的变化不急骤，也可以减轻风霜的损害。据各地调查小麦密植田麦株接近，茎叶靠拢，在夜间可以削减或阻碍近地面的空气散热，侵入密植田里的冷空气也不易在株间流通，因而有减轻冻害的作用。1954年4月20日在山西省汾阳调查春霜冻害所得的材料表明，密植田小麦茎秆冻死率为38.6％，而稀植田冻死率为69.1％。
    密植必须配合其他技术措施
    密植虽是农作物增产的中心，但必须与其他各项技术措施密切结合起来，才能发挥增产效果。实践表明：密植后也确乎带来了一些新的问题或矛盾，但只要认真执行八字“宪法”，这些矛盾是可以克服的。密植后首要的问题就是要让植物吃饱喝足。密植虽能充分利用地面和空间，但如果缺少养分和水分，也不能发挥作用。随着密度的增多，必须相应地增肥、增水。因此，为了保证密植后小麦正常发育，以深耕为基础、结合分层施基肥的耕作施肥技术就显得十分重要。过去人们反对密植的理由之一是认为密植后穗子变小，粒数变少，这种现象是存在的。但是在合理密植的情况下，单位面积内穗数增加的幅度永远是大于粒数降低的幅度，且在水、肥条件配合得当时，每穗粒数并不会减少。据1958年江苏省常熟县四十八块单季晚稻田的调查结果，每亩二十五万穗的，每穗有六十七点零三粒，三十万穗的有六十七点一七粒，后者穗数增加了五万，每穗粒数并未减少。三十五万穗的有六十二点四六粒，七十万穗的为五十九点八六粒，后者穗数增加了一倍，而每穗粒数只减少了二点六粒，即降低了4.2％。这是深耕足肥所获得的结果。密植后施肥充足，特别是及时追肥攻穗攻粒，对增加每穗粒数有更大的作用。其次，大家对密植最大的顾虑是倒伏的问题，事实上，导致倒伏的主要原因是浅耕、施肥和灌水不当，或栽培管理未配合好。1958年水稻方面的调查：在加深耕作层的基础上，采用分层施足基肥、少施勤施追肥、浅水活棵，湿润灌溉，适时烤田等措施，在合理密植的情况下，可以防止倒伏。小麦方面，结合深耕施足底肥，看苗分期适量追施氮肥，早春追施磷钾肥，适当控制拔节水以及掌握看天、看地、看庄稼的灌水方法，都是防止倒伏的有效办法。此外，改进播种方式，以利通风透光，选用秆强的优良品种，都是防止倒伏，保证丰产的重要措施。
    密植不是越密越好
    密植的增产效果是肯定的，但不能理解为越密越好。在一定的栽培条件下，应该确定一个合理的密度，也应该指出：各种农作物的密度是有合理的限度的。所谓合理密植是在增加单位面积内的株数，且以保证获得生育健壮的植株，达到苗全苗壮、穗多穗大、粒多粒饱为前提的。在一定的栽培条件下，超过了适宜的密度范围，就会遭致减产。过去在各种农作物密植栽培中，也有不少减产的实例。大体有两种情况：一是密植后其他各项措施没有跟上去，二是盲目地增加了播种量，使植株过分拥挤，严重地影响到单株的正常生长。今年部分冬小麦高额丰产试验田，在苗期已发生了这种情况，应引以为戒。根据各研究机关1958年秋季在冬小麦丰产试验田苗期的调查，每亩播种密度超过一百五十万粒时（约一百斤种籽），许多标志着苗期生育状态的特征特性就有了明显的变化。最显著的特征就是幼苗徒长，单株分蘖数、初生根和次生根的数目减少，分蘖植株百分率及着生次生根植株所占百分率明显的降低，弱苗率增多，含醣量及单株干物重锐减。又根据我所3、4月间在南部麦区所了解的情况，每亩苗数超过六十万株以上的就显得有些过密，徒长倒伏重。过密以后植株生育不良的主要原因是光照营养不良，严重地引起了光合作用强度的削弱，不利于积累营养物质。根据最近在广东、云南、四川等省麦区调查了解结果，我们初步认为每亩六十万到八十万穗的表现较好。绝不是越密越好。这是应该引起注意的。
    确定农作物密植程度的原则
    在确定农作物密植程度时，不仅应该注意不同类别的作物的区别，还应该注意同一作物，由于不同地区的气候、地力、耕作栽培等条件的差异，以及不同品种类型所适应的密植程度的区别。一般说来，禾谷类借分蘖力来调节个体间关系的作物，其密植限度要大些，如小麦、水稻等是。反之不具有分蘖特性而具有分枝特性的作物，其密植程度就小些，如豆类、棉花等是。高秆作物或中耕作物的密度也要小些，如玉米、高粱、薯类等是。按同一作物说，分蘖力强的品种密度应小些，反之应大些。早熟类型可密些，晚熟类型可稀些。株形紧凑直立型的品种的密度可大些，散生匍伏型品种的密度应小些。南方气温较高、雨量较多的地区密度应小些，北方气温较低，雨量较少的地区密度可大些（不具有灌溉条件或地力较差的地区，密度又小些）。早播的密度应小些，晚播的密度应大些。此外，在播种时还应该考虑到整地的质量、土壤水分情况、地下害虫、种子品质、播种质量等条件对出苗的影响，从而适当调节播种量。当然还应该考虑到在密植后加强田间管理所需要增加的人工。总之，影响密植程度的因子很多，应根据具体条件，灵活掌握，具体安排，不能千篇一律，生搬硬套。
    相应改进播种方式
    随着密度的增加，播种的方式也要相应的改进。根据我所目前占有的材料，小麦方面应以尽可能缩小行距，均匀条播为宜。宽幅条播也是行之有效的办法。但幅宽一般以四至六寸，幅距三四寸为宜。水稻方面的经验证明，在密植条件下，采用单行条栽的方式较好，既利于通风透光排湿，又有利于田间管理各项操作的进行。采用行距不等的宽窄行（或大小垅）的方式在玉米密植上也较适宜。甘薯方面的经验，以高垅双行交错栽植法为好。垅间宽3—3.5尺，每垅上插两行，株距0.6—1.0尺，小行距在0.5——1.4尺间。中耕作物在缩小行距时须适当考虑中耕培土管理方便，总之，密植以后确实带来了不少问题，但是，1958年各种农作物密植增产的经验告诉我们，只要掌握了作物生长发育的规律，实行合理密植，这些问题是可以解决的。
