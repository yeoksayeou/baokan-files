　　We wholeheartedly support Premier Zhou's government work report, Vice Chairman Li Weihan's report on the work of the CPPCC Standing Committee, and the reports by Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen. We feel extremely joyous and inspired.
　　People's Daily pointed out that Premier Zhou's government work report is "an epic summarizing the Great Leap Forward, a bugle call inspiring further leaps forward." We very much agree with this statement. We believe that the documents we have read at the meeting are all beautiful poems, and the reports we have heard are all resounding bugle calls. We two are already advanced in age. But the older one gets, the more one recalls the sadness and pain of being immersed in a dark environment for a long time in the new era of the Great Leap Forward, and the more one feels the happiness one is experiencing now from comparing the past and the present. As for seeing the endless stream of new people and new things, it educates us profoundly and arouses unparalleled excitement. We often think: the speed of the Great Leap Forward is one day equal to twenty years. Therefore, we old people can be liberated from the old era and enter such a great new era, and we will never have the decadent mood of "the setting sun" again, but only be filled with the optimistic artistic conception of "the rising sun."
　　In 1958 and up to recently, we participated in factory inspection work and also inspected the countryside. Although we did not go to many places in the inspection and the time spent was not long, and because we feel that we lack knowledge in the industrial and agricultural aspects, we dare not say that we have a real understanding. But just from some perceptual knowledge that we have gained, we have deeply felt that industry and agriculture are really creating amazing miracles all the time in the Great Leap Forward, and tremendous changes are taking place day and night. We have seen the workers and peasants working selflessly and racing against time in the leap forward in production, and we have also seen their remarkable achievements in the technological revolution, using both indigenous and foreign methods. The above is based on facts, and there are too many actual examples to list due to time constraints. Here, I would like to summarize: the factories we have been to were all small and medium-sized factories with relatively poor conditions and weak foundations in the past, and mainly relied on manual labor. However, driven by the leap forward situation last year, they have all been able to advance towards automation in a more, faster, better, and more economical way, greatly increasing labor productivity. The countryside we have been to was of course just a poor and blank countryside in the past. However, after the rural cooperatives, especially after the establishment of the people's communes, the vast countryside has changed its face and presented a new atmosphere. Not only have the methods of cultivation, fertilization, and field management been continuously improved, but also in the improvement of agricultural tools, they have generally moved towards mechanization. Therefore, the bumper harvest in agricultural production is unimaginable. Because the improvement of agricultural tools has moved towards mechanization, many factories have emerged in the countryside starting from scratch, which has laid a solid foundation for rural industrialization. In summary, under the leadership of the Party, following the mass line has obtained the source of the Great Leap Forward, thereby setting off the torrent of the Great Leap Forward.
　　When we inspected the countryside, we had gatherings with old peasants. In their conversations, we can affirm the high superiority of the people's communes, which is not only manifested in production but also in life. They all recounted the exploitation and persecution they suffered from the landlords in the past, thereby experiencing the joy of being their own masters now; they all recalled the miserable life they used to lead, often unable to eat enough or even begging as a family, thereby deeply feeling the happiness of not needing money for food and not worrying about firewood and rice now. These are the words of the people, sincere and powerful words of the people, which are enough to shatter the rumors and slanders of imperialism and reactionary groups against the people's communes.
　　We have both been engaged in journalism for decades, so we would like to briefly talk about our own experiences in the news business. The newspapers we worked for were founded by private capitalists. Therefore, our work was obviously serving the bourgeoisie. Moreover, because the bourgeoisie at that time was politically suppressed by the reactionary ruling class, the entire news media was also controlled by the reactionary ruling forces. Also, because the newspapers were located in the "concessions" in Shanghai, they were also controlled by imperialism. Under such multiple controls, the so-called "freedom of the press" became a deceptive lie. In reality, all freedom was lost, there was no freedom in news reporting, and no freedom in speech. The publication of news had to be checked every day, and the checkers had full freedom to arbitrarily delete news稿, or even simply cross it out with a red pen and cancel it altogether. Even if all the news on each page was already typeset and cast into lead plates, and was about to be printed, if the checkers suddenly discovered a problem, they would order the newspaper to chisel out the original text on the page, even if it meant leaving a blank space. There was a popular saying in the news media at that time for these large and small blank spaces, called "opening a window to the sky." Now, if you flip through the old newspapers, you can still see "sky windows" connected between the lines. This is a unique marker in the history of journalism in the old era. The "sky window" is wide open, indicating that freedom is suffocated. Since news reports were hindered everywhere, it was even more impossible to talk about expressing opinions freely. Sometimes, the writer could not bear the dark politics and wanted to vent and criticize, but he could only make a big circle in the writing, writing extremely tortuously and very implicitly. But no matter how tortuous and implicit it was, if those military and political "officials" or "foreign masters" in the "concessions" felt that the commentary published in the newspaper touched them, they would still find fault with the newspaper and the writer. Therefore, the life of a journalist before liberation was simply a very depressed and painful life. The tip of the pen was always dipped in ink, but the ink was always mixed with tears. We survived in such an unfree life. Therefore, after liberation, although our work is no longer in the news field, seeing that the entire national news industry has become a socialist news industry controlled by the working class; seeing that any newspaper can truly play a role in propaganda and education for readers, and truly increase readers' nourishment in politics, academics, and cultural life, becoming spiritual food that meets the needs of the broad masses; we feel extremely excited. Of course, from extreme excitement, we also feel even more extremely ashamed, because recalling our past decades of journalism work, we were only dormant in a harsh environment, suffocated in unfree air, without the courage to fight, without the power to resist, and even more without being able to fulfill the responsibilities that a journalist should fulfill. As someone who has come from the news media, what we have accumulated is not any worthwhile experience, but only materials that should be deeply examined one by one in the face of the new era.
　　In the long years of the past, in addition to journalism, we also engaged in literary writing. Mentioning writing, we cannot help but feel sweaty. Before liberation, many revolutionary and progressive writers emerged in the literary camp, which was top-notch. In addition, because the publishing industry at that time was mostly controlled by private publishers, the fate of many authors was also controlled by publishers, only serving the bourgeoisie, and even the subject matter and content of the works had to be controlled by the publishers, especially catering to the low-level tastes of the petty bourgeoisie. In order to cater to low-level tastes, it inevitably became sycophantic literature, flowing into yellow tones, which was simply vulgar. As for our own writing, it can be said to be in an intermediate state that is neither high nor low. We opposed yellow but only carried gray, we were unwilling to be sycophantic but could only provide entertainment. In short, there was no revolutionary or progressive nature. However, after entering the new era, seeing the flourishing and prosperous scene presented by the national literary and art circles under the encouragement of the literary and artistic policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend, we also know that we must strive to rise up from the emotions of self-pity and even inferiority. Especially the Great Leap Forward on the literary and artistic front in 1958, many worker-peasant writers appeared, allowing us to read many poems and other literary works by the working people, which were vivid, powerful, and rich in color. We cannot help but be happy and admire it, feeling that even from our own writing, we must go to the working masses, learn from the working people, give play to our enthusiasm, and never be content to stay in the middle, or even stand still.
　　We two are also members of the China Association for Promoting Democracy. After joining the CAPD, we feel that the association has indeed played a "promoting" role in our learning and transformation. In particular, last year, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the democratic parties carried out internal rectification, and we all participated in learning, heart-to-heart talks, and various political movements in accordance with the arrangements of the organization, thereby making some progress in our thinking and gradually improving our political understanding. As intellectuals who have transitioned from the old era to the new era, we deeply feel that we have gained a lot. At the same time, we also feel that the policy of unity, education, and transformation is indeed practical and effective for the democratic parties and for the individual members of the democratic parties. In addition, there is another situation that deeply moves us, that is, many elderly comrades in the association also study seriously and go to factories and the countryside to participate in physical labor, persisting and working hard. We therefore thought that, in terms of current examples, since we want to learn from the advanced and catch up with the advanced, we must especially learn from and catch up with the advanced elderly, hoping not to lag behind in the advanced team, and even more encouraging ourselves not to fall behind in the ranks of the elderly.
　　We must follow the instructions of Premier Zhou and Vice Chairman Li Weihan, and continue to learn and transform. In order to contribute our possible and due share of strength to the task of a greater leap forward in 1959, and to the cause of socialist revolution and socialist construction. In Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report, there is such a sentence: "Make old equipment rejuvenate." Vice Premier Li's words refer to the equipment in industrial and mining enterprises, but we were deeply moved when we heard this sentence, and it can be used as a metaphor. We believe that since old equipment can be "rejuvenated," then we, two old people from the old era, should also sweep away the twilight, transform the old self, and also achieve "rejuvenation."

### 在号角声中再跃进  严独鹤、周瘦鹃委员的发言

　　在号角声中再跃进
    严独鹤、周瘦鹃委员的发言
    我们衷心拥护周总理的政府工作报告、李维汉副主席的政协常务委员会工作报告和李富春副总理、李先念副总理、彭真副委员长的报告，并感到极度的欢欣鼓舞。
    人民日报指出：周总理的政府工作报告，是“总结大跃进的史诗，鼓舞再跃进的号角”，我们很同意这个说法。我们认为在会议中所读到的文件，都是美丽的诗篇；所听到的报告，都是响亮的号角。我们两人论年龄都已进入老年了。但越是老年人，在大跃进的新时代里，就越会回忆起过去长期沉浸在黑暗环境中的那种悲哀和痛苦，而从今昔对比中感到目前所身受的幸福。至于眼看到层出不穷的许多新人新事，更使我们受着深刻的教育，引起无比的兴奋。我们常是这样想：大跃进的速度一天等于二十年，那么，我们老年人能从旧时代里解放出来，进入这样一个伟大的新时代，就决不会再有“夕阳西下”的颓废心情，而只充满着“旭日东升”的乐观意境了。
    我们在一九五八年以至最近这一段时期里，曾参加过工厂检查工作，也曾视察过农村。虽然检查和视察中所到的地方并不多，所费的时间也并不长，又由于本身对工农业方面的知识，甚感缺乏，不敢说有什么真切的了解，但仅就我们所获得的一些感性认识来讲，已深感到工农业在大跃进中真是时时刻刻都在那里创造着惊人的奇迹，日日夜夜都在那里起着绝大的变化。我们看到了工人和农民在生产跃进中分秒必争的忘我劳动，也看到了他们在大闹技术革命中，土洋并举而具有突出性的显著成绩。以上所说，都是根据事实来讲的，只因实际的例子太多了，限于时间，不能列举。这里，想概括地说一下：我们所到的工厂，都是过去条件较差，基础也较为薄弱而以手工操作为重点的中、小型工厂，可是，经过去年跃进形势的推动，已都能在多快好省中向自动化进军，大大地提高了劳动生产率。我们所到的农村，过去当然也只是一穷二白的农村，可是，在农村合作化以后，特别是人民公社建立以后，广大农村已都改变了面貌，呈现了一片新气象，不仅耕种、施肥和田间管理等方法，已不断地改善，而且在农具改进中，也已普遍地走向机械化。因此，农业生产上的丰收，就使人难于想象。由于农具改进已走向机械化，农村中就出现了许多白手起家的工厂，又为农村工业化打下了巩固的基础。总起来说，在党的领导下，走群众路线，就得到大跃进的泉源，从而掀起了大跃进的洪流。
    我们视察农村时，曾和老农民聚谈，在他们的谈话中，可以肯定人民公社的高度优越性，不仅发挥在生产方面，也显现在生活方面。他们都倾诉着过去备受地主的剥削和迫害，从而体味到目前自己当家作主的喜悦；都回想着以前所过的是常年吃不饱甚至于全家讨饭的惨苦生活，从而深感到如今吃饭不要钱、柴米不用忧的幸福；这些都是人民的语言，真诚的、强有力的人民语言，正足以击破帝国主义和反动集团对人民公社的造谣诬蔑。
    我们以前都搞过几十年新闻工作，因此，对新闻事业也想简括地述说一下自身的体验。我们所担任编辑工作的报馆，都是私人资本家创办的，那么，我们的工作，显然只是为资产阶级服务，而且由于当时的资产阶级，在政治上是处处被压在反动统治阶级之下的，所以，整个新闻界也就要受到反动统治势力的控制，又由于报馆设在上海“租界”中，还要受到帝国主义的控制；在这样重重控制之下，所谓“新闻自由”，就成为骗人的谎话，实际上是一切失去自由，在新闻记载中没有自由，在言论中也没有自由。新闻的刊载，每天先要受到检查，检查者倒是有充分的自由权的，可以将新闻稿任意删削，或竟是红笔一勾，全部取消。即使各版新闻都已排好，而且浇成铅版，急待上印了，检查者如果突然发现问题，也要勒令报馆在版面上凿去原文，宁可留下一片空白。对这些大大小小的空白面，当时新闻界有一句流行语，称之为“开天窗”。如今试翻阅一下旧报，还能看到字里行间“天窗”相接，这就是旧时代新闻史上一种特异的表记。“天窗”洞开，正表示着自由窒息。新闻报道既处处有窒碍，再提到言论，那更是根本谈不上畅所欲言了，有时执笔者对黑暗政治，实在忍不住气，要发泄一下，指责一下，也只能在文字上大兜圈子，写得异常曲折，十分隐讳。但不管是怎样曲折隐讳，那些军政界的“官老爷”或“租界”中的“洋大人”，如其感到报纸上刊出的评论，对他是有关痛痒的，就依然要向报馆和执笔人寻岔子、找麻烦。因此，解放前新闻记者的生活，简直是一种很郁闷、很痛苦的生活，笔尖上时时蘸着墨水，墨水中却又时时夹杂着泪水。我们就是在这样不自由的生活中熬过来的，因此，解放以后，我们的工作，虽然已不在新闻岗位上了，但看到全国整个的新闻事业，已成为工人阶级所掌握的社会主义新闻事业；看到任何报纸，都真正能对读者起着宣传教育的作用，真正能增加读者在政治上、学术上和文化生活上的养料，成为适应广大群众需要的精神粮食；就感到异常兴奋。当然，从异常兴奋中也更感到异常惭愧，因为回想起我们过去几十年的新闻工作，只是蛰伏在恶劣的环境中，窒塞在不自由的空气中，没有斗争的勇气，没有反抗的力量，更没有能尽到新闻记者所应尽的责任。作为一个新闻界的过来人，所积累着的竟不是什么值得一提的经验，而仅是面对着新时代，应当一桩桩深自检讨的资料。
    我们过去在漫长的岁月中，除新闻工作而外，又从事于文艺写作。提到写作，也不免要汗流夹背。解放以前，文艺阵营中，前前后后曾涌现出不少革命的、进步的作家，这是上乘；另外由于当时的出版事业，大多数掌握在私营出版商手里，因此，许多作者的命运，也就掌握在出版商手里，只是为资产阶级服务，甚至作品的题材和内容，也要听出版商支配，特别迎合小市民的低级趣味。为了一意迎合低级趣味，就不免成为帮闲文学，流于黄色情调，这简直是下流。讲到我们本身的写作呢，可说是处于不上不下的中间状态。反对了黄色却也只带着灰色，不愿意帮闲却也只能供消闲，总之，是谈不到革命性与进步性。可是，在进入新时代以后，眼看到全国文艺界在百花齐放百家争鸣这个文艺方针的鼓舞之下，呈现出一个繁荣昌盛的境界，却使我们也自知奋勉，要从自惭甚至自卑的情绪中，振作起来。尤其是一九五八年文艺战线上的大跃进，出现了不少工农作家，使我们读到了不少劳动人民的诗歌和其它文学作品，都是生动有力而且丰富多彩。更不得不为之欢喜赞叹，感到我们即使从自己动笔头的本行上来说，也要到劳动群众中去，向劳动人民学习，发挥积极性，决不能再甘居中游，甚至故步自封了。
    我们两人又同是中国民主促进会的成员，在加入民进会以后，感到会内对于我们的学习和改造，确乎起着一种“促进”的作用。特别是去年各民主党派在中国共产党的领导下，进行内部整风，我们都依照组织上的安排，参加了学习，交心和各项政治运动，从而在思想上有了一些进步，政治认识也得以逐步提高，作为一个从旧时代转入新时代的知识分子来说，深感到有不少收获。同时更感到团结、教育、改造的政策，对于民主党派，对于民主党派中的各个成员，确乎是切合实际，行之有效的。另外，还有使我们深为感动的一种情况，是会内有不少老年同志，也都认真学习而且下工厂、下农村，参加体力劳动，做到坚持不懈，干劲十足。我们因此想到，就眼前事例来说，我们既然要学先进、赶先进，就格外要学习和赶上先进的老人，希望不致在先进队伍中落后，更自励着不要在老人行列中掉队。
    我们要依照周总理和李维汉副主席的指示，不断学习，不断改造。从而在一九五九年更大跃进的任务中，在社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业中，贡献出我们所可能尽到而且应当尽到的一份力量。在李富春副总理的报告中，有这样一句话：“使旧设备返老还童”。李副总理的话，指的是工矿企业中的设备，但我们听到这句话，却深为感动，并可借作比喻。我们认为旧设备既可“返老还童”，那么，像我们这样两个从旧时代里来的老年人，更应当扫除暮气，改造旧我，也做到“返老还童”。
