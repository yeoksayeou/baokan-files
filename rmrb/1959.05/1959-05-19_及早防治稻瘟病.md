Prevent Rice Blast Early

Ministry of Agriculture, Plant Protection Bureau

Rice blast is a serious disease of rice, affecting seedlings, plants, panicles, and grains throughout the entire growth period. When leaves of rice seedlings and tillering plants are infected, they will quickly wither and die in piles and patches within a short period. During the heading and booting stages, infection of the rachis and nodes prevents nutrient transport to the panicle, causing the entire panicle or part of it to become infertile or poorly filled. In years with heavy rainfall conducive to disease epidemics, the disease develops extremely rapidly, often causing devastating losses and even complete crop failure within a few days. Currently, rice blast has occurred in Guangdong, Guangxi, Fujian, Hunan, Hubei, Sichuan, and other provinces and regions, affecting early and mid-season rice seedlings and early-transplanted early rice. The disease is already very serious in japonica rice in Guangdong Province. To ensure a bumper harvest of rice this year, it is essential to create safe growing conditions for rice. Therefore, paying early attention to preventing and controlling rice blast and eliminating the disease in its initial stages is an extremely important task in current rice cultivation management.

The main sources of rice blast are infected rice straw and seeds. The occurrence and spread of the disease are closely related to local climate, varieties, and cultivation conditions. Generally speaking, the pathogen easily breeds and reproduces when the temperature is between 18 and 28 degrees Celsius, relative humidity is above 90%, and the weather is cloudy and rainy, in combination with the susceptible growth stages of rice plants (tillering, booting, and heading). In addition, if there are many susceptible varieties planted locally and cultivation management such as fertilization and irrigation is inadequate, the disease is likely to occur on a large scale. The pathogen infects rice plants, forming disease centers in the early stages, and then expands and spreads. Therefore, in prevention and control, it is necessary to seize favorable opportunities to eliminate the source of the pathogen on the one hand, and strengthen cultivation management to improve the disease resistance of rice on the other.

In eliminating the source of the pathogen, being "accurate and ruthless" is essential to achieve significant results. Currently, the following points should be noted for the prevention and control of rice blast:

First, pay special attention to prevention and control during climatic conditions suitable for disease occurrence and the susceptible growth stages of rice.

Second, for local susceptible varieties, rice fields with excessive or uneven application of nitrogen fertilizer, resulting in dark green leaves and weak leaf blades, should be closely monitored. Regularly check the disease and thoroughly treat it in a timely manner.

Third, pay attention to checking disease centers in the early stage of rice growth. Once new lesions appear, spray pesticides to kill the pathogen and control the development of leaf blast. Spray pesticides once at the end of the booting stage and again at the full heading stage for protection to prevent panicle blast.

Fourth, use powder sprayers and mist sprayers to apply pesticides, ensuring even and thorough coverage. In the past, rice-growing areas had fewer pesticide application tools, and many were damaged last year. Currently, efforts should be made to repair them urgently, and the masses should be mobilized to produce effective local tools in large quantities.

Effective chemical pesticides for the prevention and control of rice blast include:

(1) Organomercury agents such as Ceresan and Simesan. They can be used as powder or liquid. For powder application, mix Ceresan (or Simesan) with slaked lime powder in a ratio of 1:10 to 1:15, and mix thoroughly before spraying. The dosage is 5 to 8 jin per mu. For liquid application, according to the experience of Pingjiang County, Hunan Province, use a 0.1% concentration of Simesan solution. One jin of pesticide can treat eight mu, and the control effect is also good, which can be used as a reference for trial use in various places. However, it should be noted that Ceresan can only be sprayed on japonica rice, as it is phytotoxic to indica rice.

Whether used as powder or liquid, it can be mixed with insecticides such as 666 and DDT in proportion. When using powder, it is best to replace slaked lime powder with low-concentration 666 and DDT, and mix it with organomercury agents such as Ceresan. If using a higher concentration, such as 6% 666 powder, mix it with mercury preparations that have already been diluted with slaked lime powder, it must be prepared and used immediately, and cannot be stored, to prevent the insecticide from decomposing and becoming ineffective. For liquid use, mix half a jin of mercury preparation per mu. It should be prepared and used immediately, and pay attention to stirring frequently to prevent sedimentation.

(2) Spraying with Bordeaux mixture (copper sulfate: quicklime: water = 1:3:300) or 0.3 Baume degree lime-sulfur mixture is also effective in controlling leaf blast. However, the effect on panicle blast is poor, especially Bordeaux mixture, which can cause phytotoxicity when used during the heading stage of rice.

Local pesticides and formulas include:

(1) 3%-5% garlic solution: When using, first grind the garlic into a paste, add 3 to 5 jin of garlic to 100 jin of water, soak for 1 to several hours, and take the clear liquid to spray. The disease prevention effect of garlic solution on the first day is not inferior to that of organomercury agents, but it completely失效 after three days. At the same time, it also has the disadvantages of not being resistant to storage and high temperatures, so it should be prepared and used immediately, and the number of sprays should be appropriately increased.

(2) 1:25 cypress leaf solution, 1:50 tomato stem and leaf solution, and 1:1 *乌?* leaf solution also have good disease prevention effects. The preparation method is the same as before.

(3) Chinaberry bark solution: Take 60 jin of chinaberry bark, chop it up, add 150 jin of water, boil for one hour, filter to obtain the stock solution, and spray by adding 1 jin of the stock solution to 1 jin of water.

(4) Spraying with 1:10 or 1:15 fresh cow urine diluted with water can reduce the incidence of disease, but prevent the concentration of cow urine (especially old cow urine) from being too high, otherwise it will cause the rice leaves to burn.

(5) Spraying fine lime powder: After sieving with a fine sieve, apply 10 jin per mu, and evenly sprinkle it on the rice plants.

(6) Spreading plant ash and lime powder: Many areas use it before or at the initial stage of disease occurrence, and it has a certain disease prevention effect.

At the same time, various places should use 0.5%-1% lime water to soak late rice seeds before sowing to kill the pathogens on the rice seeds. The soaking time is 6 to 7 days when the temperature is between 15 and 20 degrees Celsius, and 4 days when the temperature is around 25 degrees Celsius.

In addition, continue to collect rice straw scattered around the fields and plots and dispose of it to prevent continued spread of the pathogen. Diseased plants and leaves pulled from the field should also be disposed of in a timely manner (such as using them for composting, as feed, burning, etc.).

In strengthening cultivation management, improving the growing environment conditions of rice, and improving the disease resistance of rice, special attention should be paid to rational fertilization to avoid inducing rice blast due to improper or uneven fertilization. For example, when topdressing, do not apply too much at one time to avoid vigorous growth of plants, which can easily get sick. It is better to apply "small meals frequently." Other aspects such as rational irrigation and timely transplanting are also important.

    及早防治稻瘟病
    农业部植物保护局
    稻瘟病是水稻的一种严重病害，在水稻的整个生长期中，苗、株、穗、粒都能受害。稻的秧苗期和分蘖期，叶片感病后，在短时期内会成堆、成片的迅速枯死；在孕穗、抽穗的时期，穗轴和茎节受害后，阻止养分输送到达穗部，使全穗或穗的一部分不结实，或结实不饱满。在雨水多适于病害流行的年份，病害发展极快，常在几天内造成毁灭性的损失，甚至颗粒无收。目前在广东、广西、福建、湖南、湖北、四川等省区已发生稻瘟病，为害早、中稻秧苗及早插早稻，在广东省粳稻发病已很严重。为了确保今年水稻的丰收，必须为水稻创造安全生长的条件，因此，及早注意防治稻瘟病，把病害消灭在初发时期，是当前水稻栽培管理上的一件极为重要的事情。
    稻瘟病的来源，主要是带病的稻草和稻种。病害的发生与流行，与当地的气候、品种及栽培条件等有很密切的关系。一般说，病菌在气温摄氏十八度至二十八度，相对湿度90％以上、天气阴雨多云的气候条件下，与易于感病的稻株生育阶段（水稻分蘖期、孕穗、抽穗期）相互配合，极易孳生繁殖；加以当地栽培感病品种较多，施肥灌溉等栽培管理不善，病害便有可能大发生。病菌侵染稻株在初生时期形成发病中心，然后再扩大蔓延。所以，在防治上，一方面要抓住有利时机，消灭病菌来源，另一方面，要加强栽培管理，提高水稻的抗病力。
    在消灭病菌来源方面，要做到“准、狠”，才能收到显著效果。当前防治稻瘟病应注意以下几点：
    第一，要在适于发病的气候条件和水稻易感病的生育阶段，特别注意防治。
    第二，对当地易感病的品种，施用氮肥过多或不均匀，使稻株叶色浓绿、叶片软弱的稻田，应严密监视，经常注意检查病情，及时彻底地进行挑治。
    第三，在水稻生育前期注意检查发病中心，一旦有新病斑出现，就应喷药消灭病菌，以控制叶稻瘟发展；在孕穗末期及齐穗期各喷药一次进行保护，防止穗颈稻瘟发生。
    第四，要用喷粉器、喷雾器施药，必须喷布均匀周到。以往稻区施药器械较少，加以去年损毁较多，当前应抓紧抢修，并发动群众大量制作有效的土工具。
    防治稻瘟病的有效药剂，化学药剂中有：
    （1）赛力散和西力生等有机汞剂。可以粉用或液用。粉用是按一比十至一比十五的比例用赛力散（或西力生）掺和消石灰粉，充分混和均匀，即可喷布。每亩用量为五至八斤。液用的办法，根据湖南省平江县的经验，用0.1％浓度的西力生液，一斤药可防治八亩，防治效果也好，可供各地试用参考。但应注意赛力散只能喷粳稻，在籼稻上使用有药害。
    无论粉用或液用，均可与六六六、滴滴涕等杀虫药剂按比例掺和使用。粉用时最好以低浓度的六六六、滴滴涕代替消石灰粉，与赛力散等有机汞剂混和；如用浓度较高的如6％六六六粉，与已经消石灰粉稀释过的汞制剂混和，必须随用随配，不能贮藏，以免杀虫药剂分解失效。液用时按每亩用汞制剂半斤，掺和使用；应随配随用，并注意经常搅动，以免沉淀。
    （2）用一（硫酸铜）比三（生石灰）比三百（水）的波尔多液，或零点三度的石硫合剂喷布，防治叶稻瘟的效果也好；但对穗颈稻瘟的效果差，特别是波尔多液，在稻的穗期使用，会引起药害。
    土药土方有：
    （1）3％—5％大蒜液：使用时先将大蒜磨碎成糊状，每三至五斤大蒜兑水一百斤，浸一至数小时，取澄清液喷布。大蒜液头一天的防病效果不亚于有机汞剂，但三天后就完全失效，同时它还有不耐贮藏、不耐高温的缺点，所以应随配随用，并适当增加喷药次数。
    （2）一比二十五柏树叶液、一比五十番茄茎叶液和一比一乌?叶液，防病效果也很好。配制法同前。
    （3）苦楝皮液：以苦楝树皮六十斤，切碎捣烂，加水一百五十斤煮沸一小时，过滤得原液，喷时以原液一斤加水一斤喷布。
    （4）一比十或一比十五鲜牛尿液兑水喷布，可以减轻发病，但要防止兑入的牛尿（特别是陈牛尿）浓度过大，否则会使稻叶有烧枯现象。
    （5）喷布细石灰粉：用细筛过筛后，每亩施用十斤，均匀撒布于稻株上。
    （6）撒草木灰和石灰粉：很多地区在发病前或发病初期使用，均有一定防病效果。
    同时，各地应使晚稻在播种前用0.5％—1％石灰水浸种，以消灭稻种上的病菌。浸种的时间，气温在摄氏十五至二十度时浸六至七天，摄氏二十五度左右时浸四天。
    此外，应继续收集田边、地头零散堆放的稻草，加以处理，以免继续传播病菌。从田中拔下的病株、病叶也应及时处理（如用以沤肥、作饲料、烧毁等）。
    在加强栽培管理、改善水稻生长环境条件、提高水稻抗病力方面，应特别注意合理施肥，避免因施肥不当或不均匀诱发稻瘟病；如追肥时，一次不能施用过多，以免引起植株猛长，容易得病，而以“少吃多餐”分次施用较好。其他如合理灌溉、适时插秧等也很重要。
