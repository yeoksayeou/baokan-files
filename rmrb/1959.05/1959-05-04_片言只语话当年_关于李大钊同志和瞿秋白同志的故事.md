Fragments of Recollections
——Stories About Comrade Li Dazhao and Comrade Qu Qiubai
Cao Jinghua

	Eternal life, Prometheus!

	Forty years ago, I had a middle school classmate whose nickname was "Little Antique."

	Originally, he wasn't a "Little Antique." In elementary school, he was deeply influenced by the "Ice-Drinking Studio" (Liang Qichao's pen name), like a seedling just breaking through the soil, revealing fresh and vibrant vitality under the scorching sun and in the wind and frost. His "compositions" were also flavored with "Ice-Drinking Studio": "The writing often carries emotion," and possesses considerable "magic."

	In middle school, his Chinese teacher was an old antique. The first time he appeared on the podium, in front of them, the old antique looked at the ceiling, shook his head, and slowly proclaimed:

	Books should not be read after the Qin and Han dynasties,
	The mind should always be in the mountains and waters.

	Then he added: "The artistic conception should be detached, not tainted by worldly concerns. There are no books worth reading after the Qin and Han dynasties."

	Thus, under his "influence," "Little Antique" soon soared up, drilling straight into the clouds above the Qin and Han dynasties. The more obscure and affected his "compositions" were, the more praise he received from the old antique.

	In terms of his outlook on life, "Little Antique" also formed "a little set" of "grand principles." That was: "Rectify the heart, cultivate sincerity, cultivate the self, regulate the family, govern the state, and pacify the world." He seemed to be reciting, spreading to everyone: "When one's heart is rectified, one's self is cultivated; when one's self is cultivated, one's family is regulated; when one's family is regulated, one's state is governed; when one's state is governed, the world is pacified. The foundation of cultivation, regulation, governance, and pacification lies in rectifying the heart. If the heart is not rectified, everything is empty talk, ultimately leading to chaos in the world."

	At the time, he deeply felt that the real society was "evil." Therefore, whenever he touched on reality, he lamented with heartbreak, "People's hearts are not as they used to be, and social customs are declining."

	He believed that the rampancy of foreigners, the warlord conflicts, the poverty of the country and its people, all stemmed from "people's hearts." Therefore, he advocated a "personal revolution." That is, if individuals cultivate themselves well and possess noble morals, they will "do not do to others what you do not want done to yourself." If everyone does this, the family will naturally be regulated, the state governed, and the world pacified. In this way, foreigners would naturally no longer bully us, and warlords would no longer engage in conflicts.

	The "May Fourth" Movement broke out. "Little Antique" made an abrupt turn from the clouds to the earth. He not only plunged into the great storm, participating in a series of patriotic movements, but also began to write in the vernacular. Thus, the "Little Antique" appreciated by the old antique became an odious "Little Rebel."

	Even so, "Little Antique's" "little set" of "grand principles" for cultivating the self, regulating the family, governing the state, and pacifying the world remained intact.

	Once, he read consecutively Comrade Li Dazhao's "Material Change and Moral Change" published in "New Tide" and "An Economic Interpretation of the Causes of Modern Chinese Thought Changes" published in "New Youth." These two bombs exploded in his brain one after another. "Little Antique's" "little set" of "grand principles" vanished.

	But he was reborn.

	After his rebirth, beads of sweat the size of soybeans rolled down his forehead, his eyes widened, and he said in surprise, "Heavens, I've been walking upside down until now!"………………………

	Marx said: "Man's existence determines man's consciousness." Now it seems that even elementary school students can recite this, but back then, it was just as Lu Xun said, in the early years of the October Revolution, when one discovered in Russian literature that "there are two kinds of people in the world: the oppressors and the oppressed!" he considered it "a great discovery, no less than the ancients' discovery of fire, which could illuminate the night and cook things."

	Prometheus stole fire from the heavens and gave it to mankind, thus offending the gods and sacrificing himself. But the fire he brought drove away the darkness of the night and brought light to mankind.

	Eternal life, our Prometheus!

	When Using "Grain," Don't Forget the "Grain" Transporters

	Lu Xun said it well.

	He said that past rulers, in order to promote a policy of keeping the people ignorant, "blocked the routes for transporting spiritual grain," and "fed young people with chaff," "They want to cover the ears of young people, making them deaf and dumb, withered and small, becoming 'last men'" (note). Therefore, he believed that "authors and translators willing to be soil," "striving to transport some practical spiritual grain and place it around young people," was "absolutely imperative." (Lu Xun's Ten-Volume Collection, Vol. 5, pp. 220-221).

	In the "May Fourth" storm, how many young people bravely broke out of their cages, carrying a strong thirst for knowledge, indiscriminately seeking spiritual food!

	Lu Xun supplied them with his own short stories, and Comrade Qu Qiubai supplied them with translations and introductions of Russian works.

	At the time, Comrade Qiubai was still studying at the Beijing Russian Language School. Before this, Chinese introductions to Russian literature were all translated through other languages, especially through English and Japanese. And Comrade Qiubai was one of the first, and an extremely outstanding one, of the few people in those days who directly introduced Russian literature from the original text. From his delicate, subtle, fresh, and original expression, this trend was already revealed. Through his eloquent writing, readers in those years, as Lu Xun said: "vaguely knew what was going to grow out of this great and fertile 'black soil,' and this 'black soil' did indeed grow things." (Complete Works, Vol. 4, pp. 353-354).

	The "grain" grown "in the great and fertile 'black soil'" was rich in nutrition.

	Comrade Qiubai was one of the first direct grain transporters.

	Forty years later, today, looking back on the past, and reminiscing about past events, it is even more important: When using "grain," don't forget the "grain" transporters.

	Complete Works note: "Refers to a kind of person who is hopeless, uncreative, ordinary, timid, shallow, and insignificant."

	About the Story of He Ning

	Comrade Qiubai once said that we don't deceive people, but we cannot but "deceive dogs."

	Everyone knows that dogs are naturally fierce and have an exceptionally keen sense of smell. They rely on this to be valued by their masters.

	Back then, the word "dog" was taboo and could not be mentioned casually, or it would bring disaster. Therefore, Lu Xun had to use the English alphabet to spell the Russian word "Sobaka" to replace "dog" when he had to mention "dog" in a letter.

	In this way, even English-speaking "dogs," no matter how much they searched through Oxford dictionaries, Webster's dictionaries, or even "Encyclopaedia Britannica"-like reference books, it would be useless. This is how one had to circle around "dogs" in those days, so that those "dogs" could "wear out their iron shoes without finding it anywhere!"

	In that severe era, in an era when literary inquisitions were extremely cruel and letters and manuscripts were strictly censored, one had to constantly use new codes to replace normal language. The names of people were not to be mentioned, and even the term "Left League" could not be used, but rather something with very little political meaning such as "Zhou Lian," "Sister Lian," "Zhou's family," "Miss Lian," etc. The term "White Terror" was even more unusable, and the transliteration of the Russian word similar to a person's name, "Belaitailao," was adopted to replace it.

	Lu Xun used more than a hundred pen names to write articles in just a few years. This was the result of being forced by "dogs," and certainly not because the author was eccentric.

	In short, all of this was done out of necessity, and the purpose was to "deceive dogs," in order to allow the revolutionary struggle to continue.

	Enough with the digression, let's get back to the main topic.

	In the early 1930s, under the leadership of the Party, the Left League engaged in fierce hand-to-hand combat with the enemy on the cultural and literary fronts.

	Under high pressure, the Left League produced many public, semi-public, and non-public publications, such as "Crossroads," "Literary Monthly," "Literary News," "Literary Guide," etc.

	At that time, I was in Leningrad. Lu Xun used every method to break through the enemy's strict blockade of the Soviet Union and sent me these publications.

	New names often appeared in the publications, and it was almost impossible to encounter familiar names. But no matter how the names changed, one could tell from the articles which ones were written by Comrade Qiubai. Later, it also proved that these judgments were correct.

	One autumn, after returning to China, I used a pseudonym to teach "Modern Chinese Literature" at a college.

	For many years, whether it was the publications compiled and printed by Lu Xun, the collections of paintings, or the single volumes of works, they were always sent to me as soon as they were published. When the "Selected Essays by Lu Xun" was published, a copy was sent to me as usual.

	However, at that time, the trend of "piracy," especially random "selection," was rampant. These "knocked-down" things were simply flooding the market. Therefore, I did not pay attention to this "Selected Essays."

	Soon, a classmate who was participating in underground work at the time asked:

	"Who is He Ning?"

	"I don't know," I replied.

	After some time, she brought it up again:

	"The preface to the Selected Essays by Lu Xun is really well written!"

	I thought she was mentioning He Ning again. But I hadn't had time to read the article.

	After another period of time, my lessons progressed to Lu Xun. It was time to read relevant articles. At this time, I thought of the "Preface to the Selected Essays," and of He Ning. I took the "Selected Essays" from the bookshelf and read it.

	From the beginning, it gave people a sense of fighting, brightness, and uniqueness. After reading about two pages, I came to Lu Xun "is the rebellious son of feudal patriarchal society, is the treacherous subject of the gentry class, and at the same time is a candid friend of some romantic revolutionaries!"

	Ah, that delicate and profound analysis using Marxist-Leninist literary viewpoints, the steadfast and clear demeanor of a literary warrior, the pen's direction, causing the enemy to be defeated... From ancient Roman mythology to Soviet literature, a bird's-eye view from the theoretical peak... In short, everything, only a person with overflowing talent, knowledge of ancient and modern China and foreign countries, and who had read tens of thousands of volumes of Marxist-Leninist works, could write such an article. He Ning, was none other than Qiubai.

	The more I read, the more I strengthened this view. After reading the whole text, I had no doubt about this judgment.

	Because I believed this judgment, I did not mention a word of confirmation in my letter to Lu Xun.

	Comrade Qiubai sacrificed in 1935.

	In 1936, the first issue of "Writer" was published, and Lu Xun sent a copy as usual. Turning to the table of contents, He Ning appeared again. The title was "About Zola." He Ning's name was neither circled in black as usual, nor was the word "posthumous work" noted. Looking closely at the article, it was Qiubai's handwriting again. Strange!

	I became suspicious. I briefly described my judgment and doubts in a letter to Lu Xun when I had the chance.

	In his letter of May 15, 1936, Lu Xun said:

	"The Selected Essays of mine? was indeed written by it?'s brother, and the preface was also written by him, because he was living in Shanghai at that time and was short of money, so he created it to sell for some money. The article ? in the first issue of 'Writer'? was originally something from his collection? Volume 1, and because the collection was not published, it was printed first. In this way, I think, your doubts can be dispelled."
			
		? That is, "Selected Essays by Lu Xun."
			
		? Second, in correspondence at the time, the code name for Comrade Qiubai.
			
		? Lu Xun's literary monthly.
			
		? That is, "About Zola."
			
		? That is, "Overseas Forest."

    片言只语话当年
    ——关于李大钊同志和瞿秋白同志的故事
    曹靖华
    永生呵，普罗米修斯！
    四十年前，有一个中学同学，他的外号叫“小古董”。
    本来他不是“小古董”。小学时代，他还深深地受了“饮冰室”的影响，像一株刚破土的幼苗，在骄阳下，在风霜中，都显露了新鲜活泼的生命力。写起“作文”来，也颇含“饮冰室”风味：“笔锋常带感情”，颇有“魔力”焉。
    中学里，他的国文教师是一个老古董。第一次在讲台上，在他面前出现的时候，老古董就眼睛望着天花板，摇头晃脑，慢吞吞地宣扬道：
    书不读秦汉以下，
    意常在山水之间。
    接着又说：“意境要超脱，不为尘俗所染。秦汉以下的书没有可读的”。
    这样，“小古董”在他的“熏陶”下，不久就凌空而起，直往秦汉以上的云眼里钻。写起“作文”来，越艰涩，越古癖，越得到老古董的赞赏。
    对人生的看法上，“小古董”也形成了“一小套”“大道理”。那就是：“正心、诚意、修身、齐家、治国、平天下。”他好像背书似地，逢人就传布：“心正而后身修，身修而后家齐，家齐而后国治，国治而后天下平。修齐治平之本在正心。心不正，一切全夸，终至天下大乱。”
    当时他深感到现实社会是“万恶”的。所以他一触及现实，就痛心疾首地慨叹说：“人心不古，世风日下。”
    他认为当时洋人的横行，军阀的混战，国穷民困，一切一切，都系之于“人心”。所以他主张“个人革命观”。就是说，个人修行好了，有了高尚的道德，就会“己所不欲，勿施于人”。人人如此，自然就家齐、国治、天下平。这样，洋人自然也不会再欺凌我们，军阀再也不会混战了。
    “五四”运动爆发了。“小古董”急转直下地从云眼里落到人间来。他不但投入到大风暴里，参加了一系列的爱国运动，而且也写起白话文来。这样，老古董眼里所赏识的“小古董”，却成了可憎的“小叛逆”了。
    虽然如此，“小古董”的那“一小套”修齐治平的“大道理”，却原封未动。
    有一次，他一连读了李大钊同志在“新潮”上发表的“物质变动与道德变动”和在“新青年”上发表的“由经济上解释中国近代思想变动的原因”。这两颗炸弹在他脑子里接连爆炸了。“小古董”的“一小套”“大道理”化为乌有了。
    可是他重生了。
    重生之后，他额上滚着黄豆大的汗珠，瞪着眼睛，吃惊地说：“天呀，我直到现在原是在脚朝天走路呢！”………………………
  马克思曰：“人的生存决定人的意识”。现在看来，连小学生都会背，但在当年，确如鲁迅说的在十月革命初年，在俄罗斯文学里发现了“世界上有两种人：压迫者和被压迫者！”的时候，认为“是一个大发现，正不亚于古人的发现了火的可以照暗夜、煮东西。”
    普罗米修斯从天上把火偷下来，传给人类，因而触怒了天神，牺牲了自己。可是他取来的火，却驱逐了夜的黑暗，给人类带来了光明。
    永生呵，我们的普罗米修斯！
    用“粮”勿忘运“粮”人
    鲁迅说得好。
    他说，过去的统治者，为了推行愚民政策，都把“运输精神的粮食的航路堵塞起来”，“用秕谷来养青年”，“他们要掩住青年的耳朵，使之由聋而哑，枯涸渺小，成为‘末人’”（注）。所以他认为“甘为泥土的作者和译者”，“竭力运输些切实的精神的粮食，放在青年们的周围”，是“万不可缓的”了。（鲁迅十卷集，卷五，页220—221）。
    “五四”风暴中，有多少青年，勇敢地冲出樊笼，怀着强烈的求知欲，饥不择食地去觅求精神粮食呢！
    鲁迅拿自己的短篇小说，瞿秋白同志拿自己的俄罗斯作品的翻译和介绍，供应了他们。
    当时秋白同志还在北京俄文专修馆读书。这以前，中国介绍俄罗斯文学，都是通过别国文字转译，尤其是通过英、日文转译的。而秋白同志是当年寥若晨星的第一批直接从原文介绍俄罗斯文学的一个，而且是极出色的一个。从他那细腻委宛、清新独创的表达中，已经露出这苗头了。透过他的生花之笔，当年的读者像鲁迅所说：“在蒙胧中，早知道这伟大肥沃的‘黑土’里，要生长出什么东西来，而这‘黑土’却也确实生长了东西。”（全集卷四，页353—354）。
   “伟大肥沃的‘黑土’里”生长出来的“粮食”是富于营养的。
    秋白同志就是第一批直接的运粮人。
    四十年后的今日，抚今思昔，缅怀往事，更是：用“粮”勿忘运“粮”人。
    全集注：“指一种无希望、无创造、平凡畏缩、浅陋渺小的人”。
    关于何凝的故事
    秋白同志曾说，我们不骗人，但我们不能不“骗狗”。
    谁都晓得，狗的生性凶狠，而嗅觉又格外灵敏。它也就仗着这而受到主子的器重。
    当年“狗”这个字是犯忌的，不能随便提，否则就招祸。所以鲁迅曾在一封信里不得不提到“狗”的时候，就用英文字母拚了一个俄文字“Sobaka”来代替。
    这样，即使会英文的“狗”，尽管它们去查遍什么牛津大字典、韦氏大字典，甚至“大英百科全书”之类的工具书也无用。这就是当年不得已时要同“狗”兜圈子，使得那些“狗”“踏破铁鞋无觅处”呵！
    在那严峻的时代，在文字狱极残酷，书信、文稿检查极严的时代，不得不经常用一些新的暗号来代替正常的用语。人名固不用提了，就比如“左联”一词也不能用，而用一些政治意味极淡的什么“周莲”、
  “莲姊”、“周家”、“莲小姐”等等来代替。又如“白色恐怖”一词，更不能用，而采取俄文字的类似人名的音译“白雷太佬”来顶替。
    鲁迅在短短几年间，用了一百多个笔名写文章。这也是“狗”逼的结果，绝非作者古怪。
    总之，凡此种种，都是不得已而为之，其目的是为了“骗狗”，为了使革命斗争能够进行。
    闲话休提，言归正传吧。
    三十年代初，左联在党的领导下，在文化和文艺战线上，同敌人进行了猛烈的白刃战。
    在高压下，左联出了不少公开、半公开和不公开的刊物。如“十字街头”、“文学月报”、“文艺新闻”、“文学导报”等等。
    当时我在列宁格勒。鲁迅用尽方法，突破了敌人对苏联的严密封锁，把这些刊物寄给我。
    刊物上经常出现一些新的名字，熟识的名字几乎难以遇到。可是不管名字如何变幻，一看文章，就知道哪些是出自秋白同志之手。后来却也证明了这些判断之无误。
    某年秋，我回国后，化名在一个学院教“中国现代文学”。
    多少年来，不论鲁迅编印的刊物也好，画集也好，著作的单本也好，总是一出版都寄给我的。“鲁迅杂感选集”出版了，照例也给我寄了一册。
    可是当时“翻版”，尤其是乱“选”之风甚炽。这类“一折八扣”的东西，简直泛滥成灾。因此，对这部“选集”，也就未加注意。
    不久，有一个当时参加地下工作的同学问道：
    “何凝是谁？”
    “不认识，”我答道。
    过了些时，她又提起来：
    “鲁迅杂感选集序写得真好呀！”
    我想她又在提何凝了。可是文章我还没有顾得看。
    又隔了一个时期，我的功课进行到了鲁迅。要阅读有关文章了。这时想到“杂感选集序”，想到了何凝。从书架上把“选集”抽下来，读着。
    一开头就给人一种战斗的、明快的、与众不同之感。大约还不到两页，读到鲁迅“是封建宗法社会的逆子，是绅士阶级的贰臣，而同时也是一些浪漫谛克的革命家的诤友！”
    呵，那细致而湛深的用马克思列宁主义的文艺观点的分析，坚定、明快的文艺战士的风范，笔锋所向，令敌披靡的冲击……从古罗马神话直到苏联文学，站到理论顶峰的鸟瞰……总之，一切一切，非才华横溢、学贯古今中外、读破马列主义万卷著作者，写不出这样的文章。何凝，不是别人，而是秋白了。
    越往下读，越坚定了这种看法。待到全文读完之后，对这判断没有丝毫怀疑了。
    因为相信这判断，所以给鲁迅写信时，也没有提一句证实一下。
    1935年秋白同志牺牲了。
    1936年“作家”第一期出版了，鲁迅照例寄了一册。一翻目录，何凝又出现了。题目是“关于左拉”。何凝的名字既没有照惯例用黑框圈起来，也没有注明“遗稿”字样。细看文章，又是秋白的手笔。怪哉！
    我怀疑起来了。便中给鲁迅写信时，把自己的判断和疑问，简述了一点。
    鲁迅在1936年5月15日的信里说：
    “我的选集?实系出于它?兄之手，序也是他作，因为那时他寓沪缺钱用，弄出来卖几个钱的。‘作家’?第一期中的一篇?，原是他的集子?上卷里的东西，因集未出版，所以先印一下。这样子，我想，兄的疑团可以冰释了。”
          ?即“鲁迅杂感选集”。
          ?二当时通信中，称秋白同志的代号。
          ?鲁迅主持的文艺月刊。
          ?即“关于左拉”。
          ?即“海上述林”。
