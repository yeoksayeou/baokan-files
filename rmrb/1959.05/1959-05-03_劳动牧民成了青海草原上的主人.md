Comrades of the presidium, fellow delegates:

I fully agree with and warmly support the government work report made by Premier Zhou, and the reports made to the congress by Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen. I will resolutely implement them in future work. Premier Zhou's report is a hymn that embodies the heroic will of 600 million people of over 50 ethnic groups. It is a summary of victory and a battle call for achieving greater victories. The report shows that under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao, our great motherland and its various ethnic groups have achieved brilliant victories in the cause of socialist construction. The unity of the motherland has been further consolidated, and the solidarity of the nationalities has been further strengthened.

Based on the increased awareness of the Tibetan people and the rapid growth of minority ethnic cadres, a high tide of socialist transformation has formed on the Qinghai grasslands.

The pastoral areas of Qinghai Province are basically Tibetan-inhabited areas. After liberation, under the close care and correct leadership of the Central Government and Chairman Mao, and under the brilliant light of ethnic policies, fundamental changes have taken place in ethnic relations. Ethnic regional autonomy has been promoted, ethnic equality and unity have been realized, and close cooperation between ethnic groups has been consolidated. Production has developed, and people's lives have improved. With the development of production, the contradiction between the relations of production and the development of productive forces has become increasingly prominent. The working people urgently demanded social reform. The increased awareness of the people and the rapid growth of minority ethnic cadres laid the foundation for achieving socialist transformation.

In accordance with the principle of "relying on laboring herdsmen, uniting all forces that can be united, and gradually realizing the socialist transformation of animal husbandry on the basis of stabilizing and developing production," and taking full account of the characteristics of animal husbandry production, and adhering to the principle of being conducive to ethnic unity, the pilot work of socialist transformation of animal husbandry began in early 1956. A group of animal husbandry production cooperatives and a joint state-private animal farm were established, achieving great achievements. Production and people's lives have been significantly developed and improved. This fact has greatly encouraged and attracted the enthusiasm of the broad masses of working people to take the socialist road, and they have asked to expand cooperatives and build cooperatives. Especially after the rectification campaign in government organs, the anti-Rightist struggle, and the criticism of local nationalism, and the widespread socialist and communist education movement in society, a high tide of socialist transformation rapidly formed on the Qinghai grasslands.

While resolutely struggling against a small handful of reactionary elements who resisted the transformation, we insisted on consolidating the unity of poor and middle herdsmen, and adopted the method of uniting, educating, and transforming the progressive elements and middle elements in the herdowner class, thereby ensuring the healthy development of the socialist transformation movement.

At the same time, a small handful of reactionary elements representing the most reactionary feudal lords in the pastoral areas, supported and instigated by the former Tibetan local government and the upper-level reactionary clique, carried out rampant sabotage activities under the guise of ethnicity and religion, attempting to block socialist transformation, split the unification of the motherland, and undermine ethnic unity, embarking on a path of self-destruction. As for this small handful of reactionary elements, and the system they represented, I may as well give a brief introduction: Before social reform, the pastoral areas of Qinghai were under the cruel rule of the feudal lord class. They not only occupied the vast majority of the means of production and means of subsistence, and implemented slave-like extra-economic exploitation of the working people, but also enjoyed various privileges. They privately set up courts, made their own laws, killed and set fire, raped women, and ruled the people with brutal criminal laws. Their criminal laws included chopping off hands, gouging out eyes, skinning, tendon-drawing, dismemberment, and burning with red-hot iron. Even in some reactionary religious upper strata who claimed to be "saviors," human bones were used as smoking pipes, and human skulls were used as tableware. Their tyranny was so extreme that it was appalling. Obviously, this system must be abolished, and the reactionary elements must be overthrown. In this situation, the working people of the pastoral areas rose up to carry out a fierce struggle, expressing thousands of years of suffering and tens of thousands of years of hatred with blood and tears, thoroughly exposing their ugly faces, sweeping away the feudal system, and declaring its final demise. In the socialist revolution movement, we insisted on consolidating the unity of poor and middle herdsmen, and adopted the method of uniting, educating, and transforming the progressive elements and middle elements in the herdowner class. At the same time, we comprehensively and resolutely implemented the policy of freedom of religious belief, distinguishing between religious belief and the feudal oppressive system of monasteries; and the boundary between general religious activities and using religion for counter-revolutionary activities. This ensured the healthy and smooth development of the movement.

The establishment of people's communes has opened up a broader road for the realization of national prosperity and development in pastoral areas.

Now, the socialist revolution in the pastoral areas of our province has achieved a decisive victory. The social outlook of the pastoral areas has undergone fundamental changes. The broad masses of working herdsmen have truly become masters, and their spiritual outlook has greatly changed. In order to consolidate the fruits of victory and strive for greater victories, we have achieved the communization of the people in one fell swoop. The establishment of the people's commune has shown its unparalleled superiority and great vitality. It has opened up a broader road for the people of the pastoral areas to carry out socialist construction at high speed and realize national prosperity and development. In order to better rely on laboring herdsmen, unite all possible forces, develop production at high speed, and consolidate the people's commune, the people's commune adopted the method of valuing the herdsmen's livestock and joining the commune and redeeming the herdowners' livestock with fixed interest. Under the principle of ensuring joint labor and unified allocation of labor, full consideration was given to the special habits and living convenience of minority ethnic commune members. Each household retained the necessary riding horses and dairy cows.

It can be seen that the liberation of minority ethnic groups from their enslaved status and their path to prosperity and development is the result of the Party's leadership, the result of the unification of the motherland and ethnic unity, the great victory of the Party's ethnic policy and the general line of socialist construction, and is inseparable from the selfless assistance of the Han people.

It can be seen that the feudal system is a serious obstacle to people's liberation, hinders the unification of the motherland and ethnic unity, and hinders progress. A small handful of reactionary elements representing the feudal system are extremely hostile to the people's cause. We must resolutely oppose them, otherwise the feudal system cannot be completely eliminated. For those progressives within the feudal lord class who accept transformation and sympathize with progress, a policy of unity, education, and transformation should be adopted to help them gradually become socialist citizens who support themselves.

It can be seen that maintaining the unity of the motherland and ethnic unity, adhering to the Party's leadership and the socialist road, are the fundamental interests and common tasks of all our ethnic groups. The sabotage of a small handful of reactionary elements can only lead to their destruction and accelerate the complete liberation of the working people. There is no other way out.

Just as the people of Qinghai are going all out, continuing to leap forward, and jointly building a great motherland, the upper-level reactionary elements in Tibet launched an armed rebellion. New and old hatred aroused the unparalleled indignation of the people of Qinghai. We fully support the State Council's order to dissolve the former Tibetan local government and quell the Tibetan rebellion. We fully agree with the Premier's analysis of the Tibetan rebellion in his government work report and the central government's policies towards Tibet, and will strive to fully realize them.

Since the peaceful liberation of Tibet, the central government has consistently adhered to the principles of the Seventeen-Article Agreement, actively supported the economic and cultural development of the Tibetan region, consistently adhered to the policy of freedom of religious belief, and advocated the implementation of ethnic regional autonomy. Three years ago, a preparatory committee for the autonomous region was established with the Dalai Lama as the chairman. At the time of the establishment of the preparatory committee for the autonomous region, the central government sent a grand delegation headed by Vice Premier Chen Yi, including representatives of more than a dozen ethnic groups, to Lhasa to congratulate the establishment of the preparatory committee for the autonomous region. This alone fully demonstrates the central government's and Chairman Mao's enthusiastic concern for Tibet to fully enjoy the rights of regional autonomy in the unified family of the motherland. I was a member of the central delegation to Lhasa at that time. There, I had the opportunity to contact some Tibetan monks and lay people. In contact with the Tibetan people, I deeply felt that the Tibetan people love the motherland, support the central government, and urgently demand liberation from the rule of serf owners. They expressed the warmest welcome to all the measures of the central government. At the same time, we saw the dark life of the Tibetan people under the rule of serf owners. In Lhasa, the reactionary serf owners' licentious extravagance formed a stark contrast with the hundreds of thousands of beggars, suffering from hunger and cold, wandering the streets. We also saw that the former Tibetan local government and the upper-level reactionary clique have consistently obstructed and undermined all the measures of the central government and the Seventeen-Article Agreement, including the establishment of the preparatory committee for the Tibetan Autonomous Region. The central government has consistently maintained the spirit of safeguarding the unification of the motherland and ethnic unity, and has patiently waited for the Tibetan reactionary clique to repent and change its ways. However, the Tibetan rebel clique took the central government's benevolent and just attitude as exploitable, intensified its efforts, and then openly colluded with imperialism, the Chiang Kai-shek gang, and foreign reactionaries, tore up the agreement, and launched a rebellion. Facts have proved that the Tibetan reactionary clique is fundamentally opposed to progress, opposed to civilization, opposed to the unification of the motherland and ethnic unity, and does not want regional autonomy. The armed rebellion they launched has more thoroughly exposed their reactionary nature of betraying the motherland, undermining the unification of the motherland and ethnic unity, and their ugly faces of willingly becoming traitors to the motherland, scum of the nation, and enemies of the people.

It is known to all that Tibet has always been Chinese territory, and the so-called statement issued by Indian diplomatic officials on the Dalai Lama is a crude interference in China's internal affairs and violates the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence.

It is universally known that Tibet has always been Chinese territory, and the Tibetan people are members of the great family of all ethnic groups in the motherland. This is the result of long-term historical development. In the long-term struggle against imperialism and feudalism, the fate of the Tibetan people has always been closely linked to the fate of all ethnic groups in the motherland, and their fates are intertwined. Tibet is an inseparable part of our country, just as Bombay is part of India. This is a fact that even young children believe. However, to our surprise, since the Tibetan reactionary clique launched an armed rebellion, in our neighboring country India, some expansionist elements have been stirring up trouble, supporting Tibetan rebels, and slandering our government. With the importance of maintaining Sino-Indian friendly relations, the Chinese people have shown great restraint in dealing with all of this. Unexpectedly, they have become complacent and recently, Indian diplomatic officials have even distributed a so-called "Dalai Lama's statement" full of lies and clumsy fabrications. This fact is undoubtedly a crude interference in China's internal affairs and violates the Five Principles. This so-called statement distributed by Indian diplomatic officials is neither a Tibetan document, nor is it easy to find any similarities with the speeches and articles published by the Dalai Lama in the past eight years. Our only discovery is that the content and tone of the so-called statement are completely similar to the recent clamors and slanders of imperialism and Indian expansionists who inherit the mantle of imperialism. Therefore, one cannot help but suspect that this so-called statement was imposed on the Dalai Lama. In the so-called statement of the Dalai Lama, the issue of Tibet's "independence" was openly raised, and the Indian expansionists showed particular "enthusiasm" for this. They discovered as if they had found a treasure: the Tibetan people are different from the Han people. Based on this, they fantasize that Tibet is a "country" and has a "strong desire for independence." How absurd is this! China is a unified multi-ethnic country composed of dozens of ethnic groups such as the Han and Tibetan peoples. Due to different historical development conditions, each ethnic group has different characteristics, but more importantly, they have a common destiny and consistent political demands, that is, the unification of the motherland and ethnic unity, that is, the Party's leadership and the socialist road. In fact, only in countries led by the Communist Party can all ethnic groups enjoy true autonomy rights; it is precisely imperialism, the Chiang Kai-shek gang, and foreign reactionaries who deny national characteristics, deny national autonomy rights, and even fundamentally do not recognize the existence of nations. The fact that China is a unified multi-ethnic country is the same as India being a multi-ethnic country. How absurd it is to say that every nation is a country! In the long-term struggle against imperialism, the Chinese people deeply understand that the so-called "independence" detached from the unified motherland is nothing more than a euphemism for becoming a colony and protectorate. We sternly warn the imperialists and Indian expansionists to calm down. The restraint of the Chinese people is limited. The Chinese people, including the Tibetan people, know what is hidden under this "independence" lie. The era when imperialists and foreign reactionaries slaughtered the Chinese people is gone forever. Tibet will always be China's Tibet. Whether to be friends with 600 million Chinese people, or to be friends with a small handful of Tibetan reactionaries who insist on being enemies with the people of the motherland and are spurned by the Chinese people. This will be a serious choice for some politicians in India. The people of our country and the people of India are friendly. In the past, present and future, we will do our best to maintain and consolidate this friendly relationship, which is beneficial to the people of China and India and safeguards the interests of world peace.

The Tibetan reactionary clique is bound to fail completely, and the newborn Tibet is bright and full of hope. We are glad to see that a democratic, prosperous and socialist new Tibet is coming. Here, we still hope that the Dalai Lama will put the motherland first, get rid of the captivity of the rebels and the situation of living under other people's roofs, and return to the embrace of the motherland.

### 劳动牧民成了青海草原上的主人

    劳动牧民成了青海草原上的主人
    札喜旺徐代表的发言主席团、各位代表：
    我完全同意并且热烈拥护周总理所做的政府工作报告和李富春、李先念副总理、彭真副委员长向大会所做的报告，坚决在今后工作中贯彻执行。周总理的报告是凝结了五十几个民族六亿人民英雄意志的赞歌，是个胜利的总结，又是争取更大胜利的战斗号角。报告表明，我们伟大的祖国和祖国各族人民，在中国共产党、中央人民政府和毛主席的领导下，社会主义建设事业取得了辉煌的胜利，祖国的统一更加巩固了，民族团结更为增强。
    在藏族人民群众觉悟提高和少数民族干部迅速成长的基础上，青海草原上形成了社会主义改造的高潮
    青海省牧业区基本上是藏族聚居区。解放以后，在中央和毛主席的亲切关怀，正确领导下，在民族政策的光辉照耀下，民族关系发生了根本变化，推行了民族区域自治，实现了民族平等团结，巩固了民族间的亲密合作，发展了生产，提高了人民生活。随着生产的发展，生产关系阻碍生产力发展的矛盾日益突出。劳动人民迫切地要求进行社会改革。人民群众觉悟的提高，少数民族干部的迅速成长为实现社会主义改造奠定了基础。
    根据“依靠劳动牧民，团结一切可能团结的力量，在稳定发展生产的基础上，逐步实现畜牧业社会主义改造”的方针，并且充分考虑到畜牧业生产的特点，本着有利于民族团结的原则。在一九五六年初开始了畜牧业社会主义改造的试点工作，建立了一批畜牧业生产合作社和一个公私合营牧场，取得了巨大的成就，生产和人民生活有了显著的发展和提高。这个事实大大的鼓舞和吸引了广大劳动人民走社会主义道路的积极性，纷纷要求扩社、建社。特别是经过机关整风、反右和批判地方民族主义与在社会上广泛进行了社会主义共产主义教育运动以后，一个社会主义改造的高潮在青海草原上迅速形成。
    在对一小撮反抗改造的反动分子进行坚决斗争的同时，坚持贯彻了巩固贫苦牧民同中等牧民的团结，对牧主阶级中的进步分子和中间分子采取了团结、教育、改造的办法，从而保证了社会主义改造运动的健康发展
    与此同时，代表牧业区最反动的封建主的一小撮反动分子，在原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团的支持策动下，打着民族和宗教的幌子，大肆进行破坏活动，企图阻挡社会主义改造，分裂祖国统一和破坏民族团结，走上了自取灭亡的道路。对于这一小撮反动分子，以及他们所代表的那种制度，我不妨做一个简略的介绍：在社会改革以前，青海牧业区是在封建主阶级的残酷统治下。他们不仅占有绝大部分的生产资料和生活资料，对劳动人民施行奴隶式的超经济剥削，并且他们享有着种种特权。他们私设公堂，自定法律，杀人放火，强奸民女，以残暴的刑法统治着人民，其刑法有剁手、挖眼、剥皮、抽筋、肢解、炮烙不一而足。甚至在一些自诩为“救世主”的反动宗教上层中，却以人骨为烟管，以人头骨为餐具，其暴虐之甚，令人结舌发指。很明显，这种制度必须废除，反动分子必须被打倒。牧业区劳动人民在这种情况下，奋起开展了激烈的斗争，以血泪倾诉了千年苦、万年恨，彻底揭发了他们的丑恶面貌，横扫了封建制度，宣告了它的最后灭亡。在社会主义革命运动中，我们坚持贯彻了巩固贫苦牧民同中等牧民的团结，对牧主阶级中的进步分子和中间分子采取了团结、教育、改造的办法。同时全面的、坚决的贯彻了宗教信仰自由的政策，区别了宗教信仰同寺院封建压迫制度；一般的宗教活动同利用宗教进行反革命活动的界限。从而保证了运动健康、顺利的发展。
    人民公社的建立，为牧业区实现民族繁荣发展，开辟了更为广阔的道路
    现在我省牧业区社会主义革命已经取得了决定性的胜利，牧业区的社会面貌发生了根本性的变化，广大的劳动牧民真正成了主人，精神面貌大大改观。为了巩固胜利成果，争取更大的胜利，一举实现了人民公社化。人民公社成立，就显示了他的无比优越性和巨大生命力。为牧业区人民开辟了一个高速度的进行社会主义建设，实现民族繁荣发展的更为宽广的道路。为了更好的依靠劳动牧民，团结一切可能团结的力量，高速度地发展生产、巩固人民公社，人民公社对生产资料采取了对牧民牲畜折价入社和对牧主牲畜定息赎买的办法，在保证共同劳动，劳力统一调配使用的原则下，充分照顾了少数民族社员的特殊习惯和生活方便，每户均留有必要的乘马和奶牛。
    由此可见，少数民族由被奴役的地位获得解放，走上繁荣和发展是党领导的结果，是祖国的统一和民族团结的结果，是党的民族政策和建设社会主义总路线的伟大胜利，是与汉族人民无私帮助分不开的。
    由此可见，封建制度是阻碍人民解放，妨害祖国统一和民族团结，妨碍进步的严重障碍。代表封建制度的一小撮反动分子，是极端仇视人民事业的。对之必须坚决反对，否则就不能彻底消灭封建制度。而对于封建主阶级中接受改造，同情进步的人士则应采取团结教育改造的政策，帮助他们逐步成为自食其力的社会主义公民。
    由此可见，维护祖国统一和民族团结，坚持党的领导和社会主义道路，是我们各族人民的根本利益和共同任务。一小撮反动分子的破坏只能招致他们的灭亡，加速劳动人民的彻底解放。别的出路是没有的。
    正当青海人民鼓足干劲，继续跃进共同建设伟大祖国的时候，西藏上层反动分子发动了武装叛乱，新仇旧恨激起了青海人民的无比愤慨。我们完全拥护国务院解散原西藏地方政府和平息西藏叛乱的命令，完全同意总理在政府工作报告中对于西藏叛乱的分析和中央对西藏的方针政策，并且全力为其彻底实现而努力。
    自从西藏和平解放以来，中央一贯坚持履行着十七条协议的原则，积极地扶助西藏地区的经济、文化发展，一贯地坚持宗教信仰自由政策和主张实行民族地方自治。三年前建立了以达赖喇嘛为主任委员的自治区筹备委员会。在自治区筹备委员会成立的时候，中央派了以陈毅副总理为首的，包括十几个民族的代表组成的规模宏大的代表团跋山涉水前往拉萨祝贺自治区筹备委员会成立，仅这一点就充分证明了中央和毛主席对西藏在统一的祖国大家庭中，充分享有区域自治权利的热忱关怀。我当时做为中央代表团的一员到了拉萨，在那里使我有机会接触了一些西藏僧俗人民，在同西藏人民接触中，深切感到西藏人民是热爱祖国、拥护中央和迫切要求从农奴主统治下获得解放的。对中央的一切措施表示了最热烈的欢迎。同时我们看到农奴主统治下的西藏人民过着的暗无天日的生活。在拉萨，反动的农奴主的荒淫奢侈同成百上千的乞丐，饥寒交迫，漂泊街头形成了鲜明的对照。我们还看到原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团对中央的一切措施和十七条协议都一贯进行阻挠和破坏，包括成立西藏自治区筹备委员会这个问题在内。中央一贯本着维护祖国统一和民族团结的精神，对西藏反动集团这种倒行逆施的行为做了耐心的等待，促其幡然悔悟。但是西藏叛乱集团却以中央的仁至义尽态度为可欺，变本加厉，进而公开的勾结帝国主义、蒋匪帮和外国反动派，撕毁协议，发动叛乱。事实证明，西藏反动集团是根本反对进步、反对文明、反对祖国统一和民族团结，不要区域自治的。他们所发动的武装叛乱就更加彻底的暴露了他们的背叛祖国、破坏祖国统一和民族团结的反动本质，和他们自甘做为祖国的叛徒、民族的败类、人民的公敌的丑恶面貌。
    西藏历来是中国的领土，这是举世共知的，印度外交官员散发的所谓达赖喇嘛的声明，这是对我国内政的粗暴干涉，是与和平共处五项原则相违背的
    举世共知，西藏历来是中国的领土，西藏人民是祖国各民族大家庭中的一员。这是长期历史发展的结果。在长期的反对帝国主义、封建主义的斗争中，西藏人民的命运一贯是同祖国各民族的命运紧密相连，休戚相关的。西藏是我国不可分割的领土的一部分，正如同孟买是印度的组成部分一样。这是黄口幼儿也深信不疑的事实。但是，使我们感到惊异的是，自从西藏反动集团发动武装叛乱以来，在我们的邻邦印度，某些扩张主义分子却兴风作浪，支持西藏叛乱分子诽谤我国政府。对这一切，我国人民以维护中印友好关系为重，表现了极大的克制，不料他们却得意忘形，最近竟然由印度的外交官员散发了谎话连篇、笨拙捏造的所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”。这种事实无疑是对我国内政的粗暴干涉，是与五项原则相违背的。这个由印度外交官员散发的所谓声明，既非我们藏族文件，又很难找到同达赖喇嘛八年来所发表的谈话和文章有哪些近似之处。我们唯一的发现就是所谓声明的内容和口吻完全与帝国主义和秉承帝国主义衣钵的印度护张主义分子最近的叫嚣和诽谤类同。因此就不能不令人怀疑这个所谓声明是强加于达赖喇嘛的。在所谓达赖喇嘛的声明中公然提出了西藏“独立”的问题，而印度的护张主义分子，对此表现了特别的“热心”，他们如获至宝的发现：西藏人同汉人是不同的，依此他们就异想天开的说什么西藏是一个“国家”，有“要求独立的强烈愿望”云云，这是何等荒谬！中国是个由汉族、藏族等几十个民族组成的统一的多民族的国家，由于历史发展条件的不同，各民族有着不同的特点，但更重要的是有着共同的命运和一致的政治要求，那就是祖国的统一和民族团结，就是党的领导和社会主义道路。事实上只有共产党领导的国家里，各民族才能享有真正的自治权利；否认民族特点，否认民族自治权利，甚至根本不承认民族存在的却恰恰是帝国主义、蒋匪帮和外国反动派。中国是个统一的多民族国家的事实，就如同印度是个多民族国家是一样的，如果说每一个民族都是一个国家，这是何等荒谬绝伦！中国人民在长期的同帝国主义斗争中，深深地懂得，脱离统一祖国的所谓“独立”，无非是沦为殖民地和保护国的一个代名词。我们正告帝国主义和印度扩张主义分子，头脑放冷静点，中国人民的克制是有限度的。中国人民包括西藏人民都知道，在这种“独立”的谎言下面是包藏的什么货色。帝国主义和外国反动派宰割中国人民的时代已经永远一去不复返了。西藏永远是中国的西藏。同六亿中国人民为友，还是同坚持与祖国人民为敌、被中国人民所唾弃的一小撮西藏反动派为友。这对于印度的某些政治家将是一个严重的决择。我国人民同印度人民是友好的，过去现在和将来我们都将竭力维护和巩固这种友好关系，这是有利于中印两国人民和维护世界和平利益的。
    西藏反动集团必然彻底失败，新生的西藏是一片光明充满希望的。我们高兴地看到一个民主繁荣的社会主义新西藏就要到来。在这里，我们仍然希望达赖喇嘛以祖国为重，摆脱被叛乱分子劫持和寄人篱下的地位，回到祖国怀抱中来。
