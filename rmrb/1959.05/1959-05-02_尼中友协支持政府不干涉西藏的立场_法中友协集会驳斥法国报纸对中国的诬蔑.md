Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, May 1st: According to reports from Kathmandu, the Nepal-China Friendship Association unanimously passed a resolution at a meeting held in Kathmandu on the 29th, expressing its support for the Nepalese government's position of non-interference in Tibetan affairs.

The resolution stated that Tibetan affairs are China's internal affairs. The resolution expressed hope that the situation in Tibet would stabilize soon.

Xinhua News Agency, Paris, May 30th: The France-China Friendship Association held a meeting on the evening of April 29th, presided over by Professor Jean Déléhé, chairman of the association, on the issue of Tibet. Maurice Magre, the first French journalist to visit Tibet, refuted the vicious slanders against China by the French bourgeois newspapers regarding the Chinese people's suppression of the rebellion in Tibet. Magre said: "The Chinese (Central People's) Government has always strictly abided by the 1951 Agreement and has helped the Tibetan people embark on the road to progress. However, the reactionary elements of the Tibetan feudal upper class themselves violated the 1951 Agreement."

Jean Chesneaux, professor and director of studies at the École des Hautes Études, cited many historical documents to point out that Tibet is an inseparable part of Chinese territory.

    法中友协集会驳斥法国报纸对中国的诬蔑
    新华社新德里1日电　据加德满都消息，尼中友好协会29日在加德满都举行的会议上，一致通过决议，表示支持尼泊尔政府所采取的不干涉西藏事务的立场。
    决议说，西藏事务是中国的内政。决议表示希望西藏局势能够早日安定。
    据新华社巴黎30日电　法中友好协会4月29日晚在该会主席让·德莱希教授主持下举行了关于西藏问题的集会。法国第一个到过西藏的记者马里斯·马涅安在会上驳斥了法国资产阶级报纸就中国人民平定西藏叛乱而对中国进行恶毒的诬蔑。马涅安说：“中国（中央人民）政府始终严格遵守1951年协定，并且帮助西藏人民走上进步大道。而西藏的封建上层反动分子自己却破坏了1951年协定。”
    高等研究院教授和研究室主任让·歇诺引证了许多历史文献指出西藏是中国领土不可分割的一部分。
