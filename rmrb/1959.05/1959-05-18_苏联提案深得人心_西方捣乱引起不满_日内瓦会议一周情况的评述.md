Geneva, May 17th (Peng Di reporting): The surface of Lake Geneva remains as calm as ever, but the city of Geneva has experienced an eventful week. The foreign ministers of the East and West have begun a sharp struggle here, focusing on the major issues in Europe today: the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany and the West Berlin problem.

By the third day of the conference, substantive discussions had begun. By the end of the week, the fundamental positions of the East and West were clearly laid out on the conference table and transmitted to every corner of the world through more than a thousand journalists and photographers from news agencies, newspapers, and radio stations from various countries.

Aside from the details of the documents and the deceptive tricks and propaganda phrases in the Western countries' proposals, the core issue of the debate inside and outside the conference essentially boils down to one thing: the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic demand that a peace treaty with Germany be concluded first and that the foreign military occupation of West Berlin be ended, while the Western countries insist on "unifying" Germany first.

People are very puzzled. The Western countries keep talking about peace, but as soon as the Soviet Union mentions concluding a peace treaty with Germany, the Western countries shrink back and hurriedly say: "No! No! To conclude a peace treaty, Germany must be unified first. To unify Germany, European security must be achieved first. To achieve European security, East and West must first engage in comprehensive disarmament. To achieve comprehensive disarmament, European political issues must be resolved first. And to resolve European political issues, Germany must be unified first..." This chain of arguments, in the final analysis, is to use West Germany's military strength and large population, supported by the United States, to annex the German Democratic Republic.

The West put forward a "package deal," glorifying it as a "peace plan," but in reality, it is a large bundle containing all sorts of junk, heavy and unwieldy. It mentions the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany, but the issue of the peace treaty is tightly wrapped inside the package, layer upon layer. It includes comprehensive disarmament, European security, and issues that the East and West have been unable to resolve for more than a decade, everything is included. And on the outside, there is a thick wrapping paper – "German unification," and it is specified that it should start with "unified Berlin," so that Western troops not only occupy West Germany and West Berlin for a long time but also further occupy East Berlin, ultimately leading to the annexation of the German Democratic Republic.

The world has never heard of such a "peace plan." It is merely a Cold War plan used to delay and obstruct agreements. Even London's "Sunday Times" pointed out in its editorial today that the Soviet Union would never accept such a Western plan.

Many Western journalists admit that although the core content of the Western plan is "German unification," none of the Western countries actually want to unify Germany, but are merely using it to obstruct agreements between East and West, to satisfy the ambitions of West German militarism, and to temporarily maintain the superficial unity of the West.

In stark contrast to the attitude of the Western countries, the Soviet delegation proposed a plan for concluding a peace treaty with Germany and ending the occupation of West Berlin. Solving these two pressing issues will not only lay the foundation for lasting peace and security in Europe but will also promote the peaceful unification of Germany through peaceful consultations by the German people. However, the Soviet delegation has repeatedly and solemnly pointed out that the issue of German unification itself is a matter for the Germans themselves and must be resolved through consultations between the two German states, without foreign interference.

The Soviet representative's position has received enthusiastic public support. The Soviet delegation has become the center of the conference from the moment it arrived in Geneva. When the head of the delegation, Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko, arrived at the venue, many people gathered nearby, shouting "Gromyko! Gromyko!" After each day's meeting, the delegations of the participating countries held simultaneous press conferences at the "Press House." The press conferences hosted by the Soviet delegation consistently attracted the largest number of journalists. Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Zorin personally hosted the press conferences twice, clarifying the Soviet position and answering journalists' questions. The attendees were extremely crowded, and Western journalists even argued with each other to grab seats. The atmosphere at these conferences was lively, in contrast to the cold and deserted atmosphere at the press conferences hosted by Western countries.

After this week of meetings, the policies and practices of the Western countries have increasingly aroused suspicion, especially when their "package deal" was thrown out by the US representative Herter, who repeatedly emphasized that it was an "indivisible whole." Even many right-wing newspaper reporters in Europe were greatly dissatisfied. At the press conference held by the British delegation that day, reporters kept asking whether the package deal could be broken down for resolution, leaving the British spokesman struggling to answer clearly. According to well-informed sources, the British have reservations about this "package deal" proposal, both in terms of content and form. Almost all the British journalists who came to Geneva to cover the conference expressed dissatisfaction with the Western "package deal" plan in their reports. The British delegation spokesman meets with these journalists individually every day, and their reports cannot be considered to be anything other than reflecting the official British opinion to some extent.

The London "Times" bluntly pointed out in its editorial commenting on the Western plan, "What is even more surprising is that this plan places Mr. Macmillan's proposals in Moscow in such an unimportant position."

Interestingly, a few hours before the Western plan was formally presented at the conference, Reuters of the United Kingdom preemptively published another version of the Western plan. The content was not entirely the same as the proposal put forward by the United States representing the three Western countries. It specifically mentioned certain British proposals, such as discussing the Rapacki Plan. This incident caused great displeasure among American and West German officials here. They believed that this was not an accidental event but a deliberate action by the British side.

A well-informed Western journalist said that this Western "package deal" is more accurately described as a plan of the United States and West Germany rather than a plan of the three Western countries. This also illustrates the extent to which this Western "package deal" plan is unpopular, even to the point that the proposers themselves are dissatisfied.

The Foreign Ministers' Conference started very tensely, first encountering the issue of the participation of the two German states. The United States hoped that the two German states would sit behind the representatives of the Four Powers, subordinate to the Four Power delegations, in a consultative position without the right to speak. However, after the Soviet Union's firm struggle, the representatives of the two German states are now sitting face-to-face in a circle with the representatives of the Four Powers, with full speaking rights, participating in the discussion, although the United States insisted on using two rectangular tables to separate the seats of the two German delegations from the round table used by the representatives of the Four Powers. For the first time, the representative of the German Democratic Republic formally expressed the German people's desire for a peaceful and negotiated resolution of the peace treaty and West Berlin issues at the East-West Foreign Ministers' Conference.

On the issue of Poland and Czechoslovakia participating in the conference, it has not yet been resolved due to the obstruction of Western countries, especially the United States. However, the Soviet Union's efforts to secure the participation of Poland and Czechoslovakia in the conference have won the sympathy and support of fair-minded public opinion in the world. This issue remains on the conference agenda, and the Soviet Union will continue to fight for the legitimate rights and interests of Poland and Czechoslovakia.

The struggle between two lines at the Foreign Ministers' Conference has just begun. Who wants peace and who does not want peace; who is sincerely seeking to ease the international situation and resolve the German question; who is deliberately obstructing agreements and maintaining tension - people have seen this very clearly from the short week of the Geneva Conference.

    苏联提案深得人心　西方捣乱引起不满
    日内瓦会议一周情况的评述
    本报日内瓦17日电　记者彭迪报道：日内瓦湖面，照旧是那样平静，但是日内瓦城却经历了不平静的一周。东西方的外长们在这里围绕着目前欧洲的重大问题——缔结对德和约和西柏林问题——开始了一场尖锐的斗争。
    会议开幕后第三天，就进入了实质问题的讨论。一周末了，东西双方的基本立场已经鲜明地对摆在会议桌面上，并且通过一千多个来自各国的通讯社、报纸、广播电台的记者和摄影记者，把它们传送到世界上每一个角落。
    撇开文件细节和西方国家提案的欺骗花样和宣传词句不讲，目前在会内会外争论的问题中心，实质上只有一个——苏联和德意志民主共和国要求首先缔结对德和约和结束外国军队对西柏林的占领制度，而西方国家却坚持要首先“统一”德国。
    人们都很奇怪，西方国家口口声声说要和平，但是苏联一提到要缔结对德和约，西方国家就直往后缩，连忙说：“不行！不行！要缔结和约必先统一德国，要统一德国，必先取得欧洲安全，要欧洲安全，东西方必先全面裁军，要全面裁军，必先解决欧洲政治问题，而解决欧洲政治问题，首先就要统一德国。……”这一连环套，归根结蒂，就是要利用西德在美国支持下的军事实力和人口多，来吞并德意志民主共和国。
    西方在会上提出了一个“一揽子计划”，美其名曰“和平方案”，实际上是一个什么破铜烂铁都包在里面的大包袱，又沉又扎手。其中也提到一下缔结对德和约，但是这个和约问题被紧紧地包扎在大包袱的最里面，外面一层包一层，又是全面裁军，又是欧洲安全，东西双方扯了十几年都不能解决的问题，都摆了进去，应有尽有，而最外面还有一块厚厚的包袱皮——“德国统一”，而且标明要从“统一柏林”着手，让西方军队不仅长期占领西德和西柏林，而且也要进一步占领东柏林，最后以吞并德意志民主共和国而告终。
    世界上还没有听说过有这样的“和平方案”。它只是一个用来拖延和阻挠协议的冷战方案。连伦敦的“星期日泰晤士报”在今天的社论中也指出这样一个西方计划，苏联是绝不会接受的。
    许多西方记者都承认，西方计划的中心内容虽说是“统一德国”，但西方国家谁也不想统一德国，而只是利用它来阻挠东西方协议，满足西德军国主义的野心和暂时维系西方的表面团结。
    同西方国家的态度正相反，苏联代表团在会上提出了缔结对德和约和结束西柏林占领制度的方案。这两个迫切的问题的解决不但将为欧洲的持久和平和安全奠定基础，而且也将促进德国人民通过和平协商达成和平统一。但苏联代表团一再严正地指出，德国统一问题本身是德国人自己的事，必须两个德国自己协商解决，外国不得干涉。
    苏联代表的立场受到公众的热烈支持。苏联代表团从一到达日内瓦就成为会议的中心。代表团团长、苏联外长葛罗米柯去会场开会时，一下汽车，许多人就围聚在附近，大声欢呼“葛罗米柯！葛罗米柯！”每天会议开完后，参加会议各国的代表团，在“记者之家”分别同时举行记者招待会，苏联代表团主持的记者招待会经常吸引了最多数的记者。苏联副外长佐林两次亲自来主持招待会，阐明苏联的立场和回答记者的问题。参加的人特别拥挤，甚至为了抢占坐位，西方记者们之间发生争吵。会上气氛活跃，相形之下，在西方国家主持的记者招待会，显得冷冷清清。
  经过这一星期的会议，西方国家的政策和作法，越来越引起人们的怀疑，特别是他们的那个“一揽子”大包袱被美国代表赫脱摔出来，并反复强调那是一个“不可分割的整体”时，连欧洲许多右翼的报纸记者都大为不满，在当天英国代表团举行的记者招待会上，记者们就不断追问，究竟这个大包袱，能不能拆开来解决，弄得那个英国发言人，难于应付，支支吾吾，始终也没回答清楚。据消息灵通人士说，英国对于这一“大包袱”的建议，从内容到形式，都有保留。几乎所有英国各报纸来日内瓦采访会议的记者，在他们写回去的报道中，对于西方这一“大包袱”计划都流露不满。英国代表团发言人和这些记者每天单独会见，他们的报道不能不被认为是多少反映了英国的官方意见。
    伦敦“泰晤士报”在评西方计划的社论中就老实不客气地指出，“更令人惊奇的是，这个计划把麦克米伦先生在莫斯科提出的意见放在这样不重要的地位。”
    有趣的是，在西方计划在会上正式提出以前几个小时，英国的路透社竟抢先发表了西方计划的另一版本，内容和美国代表西方三国提出来的方案并不尽同，其中特别提到某些英国方面的主张，如应该讨论腊帕茨基计划等。这件事引起了这里美国和西德官员们很不愉快。他们认为这不是一个偶然事件，而是英国方面的有意行动。
    一个消息灵通的西方记者说，这个西方“一揽子计划”，与其说是西方三国计划，不如说是美国和西德的计划更为确切。这也就说明这个西方“一揽子”方案的不得人心到了这样的程度，甚至提案人自己也感到不满。
    外长会议一开始就很紧张，首先遇到的是两个德国参加会议的问题。美国希望两个德国坐在四大国代表的后面，附属于四国代表团，处于被谘询地位，没有发言权。但是经过苏联的坚决斗争，两个德国的代表现在是面对面和四大国代表围坐一圈，具有充分的发言权，参加讨论，虽然美国坚持用两张长方桌子来把两个德国代表团的坐位和四大国代表用的圆桌子隔离开来。德意志民主共和国的代表第一次在东西方外长会议上正式表达了德国人民要求和平协商解决和约和西柏林等问题的愿望。
    在波兰、捷克斯洛伐克参加会议的问题上，由于西方国家特别是美国的阻挠，一时尚未解决，但苏联为争取波兰、捷克斯洛伐克参加会议的努力，取得世界上公正舆论的同情和支持。这个问题还是留在会议的日程上，苏联将继续为波兰、捷克斯洛伐克应有的权益而斗争。
    外长会议上两条路线的斗争刚开始。谁要求和平，谁不要和平；谁在真诚寻求缓和国际局势，解决德国问题；谁在蓄意阻挠协议，维持紧张，人们从短短一星期的日内瓦会议已经看得很清楚。
