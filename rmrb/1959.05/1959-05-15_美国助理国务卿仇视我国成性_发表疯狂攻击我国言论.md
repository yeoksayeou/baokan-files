Xinhua News Agency, May 14th dispatch from Washington: U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs Walter Robertson, while testifying before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on the foreign aid program on the 11th, focused on denigrating China, stirring up discord between China and its Asian neighbors, and advocating that the United States continue to pursue a policy of aggression and tension-creation in the Far East.

Robertson once again slandered the Chinese government's suppression of the armed rebellion in Tibet and provoked relations between China and Eastern countries. He falsely accused the Chinese government of "a shocking suppression of Tibetan freedom" and "increasingly barbaric acts" in quelling the Tibetan rebellion. He also said, "Beijing has overthrown the established government of Tibet and used weapons against the Tibetan people. In this bloody and unscrupulous action, Communist China has exposed its true face to its Asian neighbors." He further stated, "The threat of Red China has never been as clear or as ominous as it is now."

Robertson made every effort to create the so-called "threat of Communist China" to intimidate Eastern countries. He said that China "threatens everywhere" and is "currently striving to expand, by means of military threats and pressure, economic warfare tactics, diplomatic and political conspiracies, infiltration, propaganda, and all other standard means of infiltration of international communism, to subvert the free countries of the Far East."

Robertson's remarks showed that he was making every effort to discredit China because of the "rise of nationalism and anti-colonialism in the East, which is often reflected in suspicion of Western countries"; especially "the sudden transformation of the Soviet Union from a relatively backward country into a modern power with developed industry and science within forty years. Communist China is currently striving to achieve a similar Great Leap Forward," and "this method of the Communists in rapidly achieving material results is attractive to their (Eastern countries') impatient mood."

Therefore, Robertson viciously slandered China's people's communes, nonsensically claiming that "this terrible system is destroying family life and destroying all human values. Under this system, the people have become robots who are completing whatever work the state assigns them. And even more ominous is the militaristic nature of the commune system."

Robertson vehemently attacked China's firm opposition to aggression and its foreign policy of safeguarding peace. He said that "the foreign policy actions taken by China in the past year have proved" that "Beijing's view of the world is becoming increasingly barbaric. It is becoming increasingly indifferent to foreign public opinion." He described the Chinese people's confidence in the inevitable victory of communism as "a dangerous and overconfident attitude." He said that it (China) does indeed believe that "the East Wind will prevail over the West, and communism is the irresistible wave of the future."

Robertson had to admit that "the Chinese Communist regime is unlikely to be replaced in the foreseeable future," and that it is "highly unlikely" that the West will "alienate" the Sino-Soviet alliance. Robertson put forward three main methods for the United States to implement a policy of hostility towards China and create tension in the Far East: namely, "maintaining a sufficiently strong U.S. military position"; continuing to help the so-called "free Far East" "strengthen its economic, political, and military forces as quickly as possible"; and "using the means available to us (the United States) to curb the growth of China's power and influence."

Robertson also advocated adhering to the policy of occupying Taiwan and continuing to create tension in the Taiwan Strait. He said that "if the United States retreats in the face of threats," it "will not only invite further exploration by the Communists in the Far East, but will also increase the danger of war."

When talking about American "aid" to the Asian region, Robertson particularly emphasized the importance of "aid" to the Chiang Kai-shek, Syngman Rhee, and Ngo Dinh Diem cliques. He also unabashedly revealed the political price of "U.S. aid," saying that the U.S. foreign aid program is a "tool for the United States to implement its foreign policy," and that U.S. "aid" to a country "depends on" the state of relations between the United States and the recipient country, as well as the nature and goals of that country's foreign policy.

### 美国助理国务卿仇视我国成性  发表疯狂攻击我国言论

    美国助理国务卿仇视我国成性
    发表疯狂攻击我国言论
    新华社14日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国务院远东事务助理国务卿罗伯逊11日在美国参议院外交委员会就援外计划作证的时候，集中诋毁中国，挑拨中国同亚洲邻国间的关系，并且鼓吹美国要继续在远东地区执行侵略和制造紧张局势的政策。
    罗伯逊再一次对中国政府平息西藏武装叛乱进行诬蔑并挑拨中国和东方国家的关系。他诬蔑中国政府平定西藏叛乱是“对西藏自由进行的骇人听闻的镇压”，是“愈来愈蛮横的行径”。他还说，“北平推翻了西藏的业经确立的政府，使用武器对付西藏人民。在这种血腥的、肆无忌惮的行动中，共产党中国向它的亚洲邻国暴露了它的真面目。”又说，“赤色中国的威胁从来没有像现在这样明显，这样预兆不祥”。
    罗伯逊竭力制造所谓“共产党中国的威胁”来恫吓东方国家。他说，中国“在一切地方进行威胁”，“目前正在竭力进行扩张，办法是通过军事威胁和压力、经济战的策略、外交和政治阴谋、渗透、宣传和国际共产主义的其他一切标准的渗入办法，来颠覆远东的自由国家”。
    罗伯逊的发言表明，他之所以竭力诋毁中国，是由于东方“民族主义和反殖民主义兴起，这种情况常常反映为对西方国家的怀疑”；特别是“苏联在四十年内突然从一个比较落后的国家变成一个工业和科学发达的现代大国。共产党中国目前正在努力实现类似的大跃进”，“共产党的这个迅速取得物资结果的办法对于他们（东方国家）的迫不及待的心情是有吸引力的”。
    因此罗伯逊恶毒地诬蔑中国的人民公社，胡说什么“这种可怕的制度正在消灭家庭生活和毁灭一切人类的价值。在这种制度下，人民变成了替国家完成它所指定的任何工作的机器人。而更不祥的是公社制度的军国主义性质。”
    罗伯逊大肆攻击中国坚决反对侵略、维护和平的外交政策，他说，中国“在过去一年所采取的外交政策行动证明了”“北平对世界的看法越来越蛮横了。它对外国的舆论越来越不在乎了。”他把中国人民对于共产主义必然胜利的信心说成是“一种危险的、过于自信的态度”。他说，它（中国）的确认为，“东风将压倒西方，共产主义是未来不可阻挡的浪潮”。
    罗伯逊不得不承认，“中国共产党政权在可以预见的将来不大可能被代替”，而且西方“极少可能”来“疏远”中苏联盟。罗伯逊提出了美国在远东执行敌视中国和制造紧张局势的政策的三种主要方法，这就是：“维持足够强有力的美国军事地位”；继续帮助所谓“自由的远东”“尽快加强经济、政治和军事力量”；“使用我们（美国）可以使用的方法来遏制中国的力量和影响的增长”。
    罗伯逊还鼓吹坚持霸占台湾和继续在台湾海峡制造紧张局势的政策。他说，“如果美国在威胁面前退却的话”，“不仅会招致共产党在远东进一步进行探索，而且还会扩大战争的危险”。
    罗伯逊在谈到美国对亚洲地区的“援助”时特别强调对蒋介石、李承晚和吴庭艳集团的“援助”的重要性。他还毫不掩饰地道出了“美援”政治价格，他说，美国的对外援助计划是美国“执行外交政策的一个工具”，美国对一个国家的“援助”“决定于”美国同受援国家间关系的状况以及那个国家的外交政策的性质、目标等。
