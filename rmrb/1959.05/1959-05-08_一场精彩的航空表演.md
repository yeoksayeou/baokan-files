　　A Wonderful Aviation Show
　　By our reporter Jiang Wenpin
    On the morning of May 7th, the second day of the Chinese People's Liberation Army's Second Sports Meet, a truly wonderful aviation show took place.
    At eight o'clock in the morning, three primary trainer aircraft, bearing the five-star red flag and the "August 1st" army flag, flew majestically in a "V" formation over the airport at low altitude, announcing the start of the show.
    Helicopters, looking like four large dragonflies, slowly approached the airspace above the airport. They performed vertical landings, vertical takeoffs, hovering in mid-air, turning in place, and lateral flight maneuvers for the audience, before scattering colorful leaflets to the spectators. Following this, male and female paratroopers from a certain unit of the People's Air Force performed formation skydiving, combined skydiving, and stunt skydiving. The azure sky was immediately filled with countless beautiful large lotus flowers – colorful parachutes. Famous female paratrooper He Jianhua and her partners descended gently in the breeze with graceful movements. He Jianhua and Geng Guifang, among others, were the creators of two world records in the women's 1,000-meter team precision landing and the women's 1,500-meter team combined skydiving.
    The most exciting part was the aerial parachute display. After the performance began, two exquisite small parachutes appeared in the air, with the paratroopers seemingly on an invisible swing, swaying leisurely in the air. In a flash, the white parachute departed like a lone sail blown by a storm at sea, and the paratrooper shot straight down like an arrow released from a bow. "Gone!" Before the announcer's voice had faded, a colorful parachute flashed open above the paratrooper's head. "Gone again!" The paratrooper released the colorful parachute in his hand, plummeting free, and quickly opened a third parachute in the air. In this way, he released one and opened another, continuously releasing four parachutes before the paratrooper landed safely with the fifth parachute.
    While the paratrooper performing the aerial parachute display had not yet landed, nine large transport planes carrying two hundred fully armed paratroopers arrived over the airport. Within seconds, the paratroopers jumped out of the cabins one after another, and the sky above the airport was filled with many colorful parachutes, just like a lotus pond with a hundred lotuses in full bloom. Some of these colorful parachutes were as red as palace lanterns, some resembled pagodas, some were as ingenious as orbiting stars, and some were as beautiful as lotus flowers. After the group of parachutes landed, teams of fully equipped paratroopers appeared in an instant, looking as if they were ready to go into battle immediately.
    After the aeromodelling performance began, many model airplanes in various styles such as dragonflies, kites, and wild geese appeared in the sky above the airport. They circled left and right in the sky, sometimes going up and sometimes down, moving very freely.
    Following the glider performance, the advanced and complex aerobatic performances of jet fighters began.
    Air Force heroes from the Fujian front performed a four-plane pursuit aerobatic display for the audience. These two pairs of lead and wingmen were close comrades-in-arms on the Fujian front. Today, they again presented a report performance to the Party and state leaders, demonstrating the People's Air Force's incomparably powerful might through the various ingenious tactics and superb shooting skills used in combat to pursue and annihilate or deceive enemy aircraft!
    Pilot Liu Junjie, who had performed meritorious service on the Korean battlefield, flew the eagle like lightning across the field. Then he tilted his wings, sometimes rolling laterally, sometimes tumbling; now drilling into the sky, now appearing before people's eyes.
    At ten thirty, three trainer aircraft carrying colored ribbons flew in, bringing the heartening aviation show to a close. (Attached picture)

　　一场精彩的航空表演
　　本报记者　姜文品
    中国人民解放军第二届体育运动大会开幕第二天——7日的上午，进行了一场极为精彩的航空表演。
    上午八时，三架初级教练机悬挂着五星红旗和“八一”军旗，排成品字队形，雄伟地飞过机场低空，它宣告：表演开始了。
    像四只大蜻蜓的直升飞机，缓缓地来到机场上空，它们给观众表演了垂直着陆、垂直起飞、空中停立、原地转弯和横侧飞行等动作，然后向观众撒出五彩缤纷的传单。接着人民空军某部男女跳伞员表演了花样跳伞、综合跳伞和特技跳伞。碧蓝的天空中，顿时布满了无数朵美丽的大荷花  彩色降落伞。著名女跳伞员赫建华和她的伙伴们以优美的动作，在微风中轻轻地降下。赫建华和耿桂芳等曾经是女子一千公尺集体定点跳伞和女子一千五百公尺集体联合跳伞两个世界纪录的创造者。
    最精彩的是空中飞伞的表演。表演开始后，空中出现了两只玲珑的小伞，跳伞员像架着一个无形的秋千，在空中安闲地荡漾。一闪之间，白伞像海洋里被风暴吹着的孤帆一样离去，跳伞员如离弦的箭儿直射下来。“飞啦！”解说员的声音未落，一个花伞一闪又在跳伞员的头顶上张开。“又飞啦”跳伞员甩开手上的花伞，徒手急坠而下，并且很快地在空中又撑开第三只伞。这样甩掉一个，又撑开一个，连续甩掉四个伞后，跳伞员带着第五个伞安然着陆了。
    当表演飞伞的跳伞员还未落地时，九架大型运输机载着二百名全副武装的伞兵来到机场上空。几秒钟内，伞兵们先后跳出机舱，机场的上空出现了许多五彩缤纷的花伞，恰如一个百荷盛开的莲池一般。这些花伞有的红如宫灯、有的貌似宝塔、有的巧如环星、有的美如莲花。当群伞着陆后，顷刻出现一队队装备齐全好像准备立即投入战斗的伞兵。
    航空模型表演开始后，机场上空出现许多像蜻蜒、鹞鹰、鸿雁等各种样式的模型飞机。它们在天空左右盘旋，忽上忽下，行动十分自如。
    滑翔机表演之后，开始了喷气歼击机的高级特技和复杂特技的表演。
    在福建前线的空军英雄们，为观众作了四机追踪特技表演。这两对长机、僚机在福建前线就是两对亲密的战友。今天他们又以实战中追歼敌机或迷惑敌机所运用的多种绝妙战术和高超的射击技术，向党和国家领导人作了汇报表演，显示了人民空军强大无比的威力！
    在朝鲜战场上立过战功的飞行员柳俊杰驾驶着雄鹰像闪电般掠场而过。接着就侧着翅膀，时而横滚，时而翻滚；忽而钻入天际，忽而出现在人们的眼前。
    十点半三架教练机载着彩带飞来，结束了这场振奋人心的航空表演。（附图片）
