This dispatch from Guiyang on the 25th reports that Guizhou's mountainous regions are organizing farmers from various ethnic groups to support and collaborate with each other during the rush to harvest wheat and rapeseed, greatly accelerating the harvesting speed. As of the 20th, over 610,000 mu of the province's more than 1.9 million mu of rapeseed had been harvested, and wheat harvesting had also begun in some areas. Tongren, Xingyi, Luodian and other counties have completed the rapeseed harvest.

The distribution of Guizhou's more than 5 million mu of wheat and rapeseed is very uneven, with most concentrated on some plains. Consequently, the amount of summer harvest crops planted by each production team varies, and the harvest season comes earlier or later for different teams. After the rush harvest began, areas with more wheat and rapeseed plantings faced severe labor shortages. Even with full-scale harvesting, it would take ten days to half a month to complete the work, while areas with fewer plantings had surplus labor. In order to avoid missing the agricultural season and ensure timely harvesting of summer crops, all counties, in addition to having leading cadres participate in and lead production, universally adopted measures such as exchanging labor and providing wages, based on the principle of equivalent exchange, to organize mutual support among farmers of various ethnic groups. The specific methods are: production teams with later-maturing crops support those with earlier-maturing crops, teams with fewer plantings support those with more plantings, and teams that finish harvesting first support those that have not yet finished.

Large-scale labor collaboration is not only beneficial to production but also promotes unity among the working people of all ethnic groups. In Pingjiang Management Area of Guizhou People's Commune, Rongjiang County, Southeast Guizhou Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture, Miao commune members living in the high mountains heard that the Dong commune members had planted over 4,000 mu of high-yield fields with wheat and rapeseed, which were all ripe, but could not be harvested in time due to a lack of labor. They proactively sent more than 750 people down the mountain to assist in the rush harvest. Commune members of the Guangming and Gaozhuang production teams, where the Shui ethnic farmers of Fengle People's Commune in Sandu Shui Autonomous County live, organized more than 1,000 commune members, bringing their own food, to brave the rain, cross mountains and rivers, and travel 20 to 30 li to support the rush harvest in production teams inhabited by Han and Buyi farmers. The commune members who received the support said with emotion: "The Shui brothers braved the rain to help us with the rush harvest. We must work even harder!"

In organizing large-scale collaboration, in order to make the summer harvest both fast and good, each commune established a responsibility system and implemented a "fixed work production, reward for exceeding quotas" method, specifying the person, field, work points, quality, and time for each task, which improved harvesting efficiency and quality. Based on the responsibility system, the production teams in Luodian County, where the Buyi people live, further divided the work into harvesting, transportation, and storage work groups, promoting assembly line operations. In just over ten days, they not only completed the county's summer harvest tasks but also plowed the land in preparation for summer planting.

### 根据等价交换的原则组织大协作  贵州各族农民互相支援夏收

    根据等价交换的原则组织大协作
    贵州各族农民互相支援夏收
    本报贵阳25日电  贵州山区在抢收小麦油菜中，组织各族农民互相支援，开展协作，大大加快了抢收速度。到20日止，全省一百九十多万亩油菜已收割六十一万多亩，小麦收割工作也在部分地区展开。铜仁、兴义、罗甸等县油菜已全部收割完毕。
    贵州全省五百多万亩小麦、油菜分布很不平衡，大部分集中在一些平坝上，因而各生产队种植夏收作物数量有多有少，收获季节有早有迟。抢收开始后，种小麦和油菜多的地区，劳力十分紧张，就是全力收割，也得十天半月才能收完，而种得少的地区，劳力又有剩余。为了不违农时，把夏收作物及时收进仓，各县除了领导干部参加生产和领导生产外，普遍根据等价交换的原则，采取换工、互给工资等办法，组织各族社员互相支援。具体作法是：作物成熟迟的生产队支援成熟早的生产队，种得少的队支援种得多的队，先收割完的队支援未收完的队。
    劳力大协作不仅有利于生产，也促进了各民族劳动人民之间的团结。黔东南苗族侗族自治州榕江县古州人民公社平江管理区，住在高山上的苗族社员听到山下由侗族社员种植四千余亩丰产坝的小麦油菜都已黄熟，但因劳力缺乏不能及时收割，就主动派出七百五十多人下山协助抢收。三都水族自治县丰乐人民公社水族农民聚居的光明、高庄等生产队的社员，组织一千多名社员，自带伙食，冒雨翻山涉水，赶到二、三十里外汉族、布依族农民居住的生产队支援抢收。受到支援的社员们感动地说：“水族兄弟冒雨来帮我们抢收，我们要格外加油干呵！”
    在组织大协作中，为了使夏收又快又好，各公社都建立了责任制，实行定人、定田、定工分、定质量、定时间的“定工生产、超额奖励”办法，提高了收割效率和质量。布依族聚居的罗甸县各生产队在实行责任制的基础上，又分收割、运输、保管等作业小组，推行流水作业，在十多天里，不仅完成全县夏收任务，还把准备夏播的地都翻犁好。
