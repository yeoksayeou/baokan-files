　　Deep Friendship of Millions of Farmers
　　By Our Reporter　Yi Xintian
    For over a year, the linked competition between Huangyan and Pingyang, located more than 500 miles apart, has fostered a close friendship between over a million farmers in the two counties. Now, people from these two counties visit each other frequently. Representatives from Pingyang receive warm hospitality wherever they go in Huangyan; representatives from Huangyan are also welcomed everywhere in Pingyang. The friendship established between the people of the two counties through the competition has blossomed brilliantly.
    In late April, I made a trip to Pingyang and Huangyan. The people of the two counties learn from each other, compete with each other, care for each other, and support each other selflessly in the competition. What I saw and heard was truly exciting and moving.
    Gaining a Good Magic Weapon
    In early February, a group of guests arrived at the Wuyan Commune and the Luqiao Commune in Huangyan County. They were the Party Committee Secretaries and some Production Brigade General Branch Secretaries from various communes in Pingyang County. Chen Shiqiang, Deputy Secretary of the Luqiao Commune Party Committee, introduced his experiences in cadres participating in labor and commune members participating in management. Huang Changchun, General Branch Secretary of the Chengnan Brigade in the Wanquan Commune of Pingyang, became more and more interested as he listened, remembering every word. After listening, he was not satisfied and kept asking questions, not letting anything go. He thought, our brigade's commune members are good at production and have great enthusiasm, but the cadres have too much work and are often busy and sweating, yet the masses are still not satisfied. Now I've found a magic weapon. In the evening, Huang Changchun and Liao Xilong, General Branch Secretary of the Chengxi Brigade, slept together, and the two talked late into the night. Huang Changchun carefully considered how to convey this message back home, unable to sleep for a long time.
    Huang Changchun returned home at noon and immediately announced a meeting for the evening. At the Party meeting, he told everything he had remembered in his mind in its entirety. Everyone listened and discussed it with zest. They all said: "Good experience, good method, it's really a treasure!" In just three days, all twenty-nine cadres in the brigade and its production teams participated in labor, and each production team assigned one commune member to take turns on duty every day, directly participating in production management. Both cadres and commune members were very satisfied.
    In March, a delegation led by Xu Jiliang, Secretary of the Huangyan County Party Committee Secretariat, visited Chengnan Brigade in Pingyang. Huang Changchun introduced that all their cadres participated in labor and were evaluated and scored the same as commune members. There were no full-time cadres in the entire brigade. Not only was the work not affected, but it was even better done. Xu Jiliang and the representatives believed this was also a treasure and brought their experience back to promote it throughout the county.
    Experts and Model Workers Become Friends
    In early March this year, just as early rice sowing was beginning, Yang Kuangbao, a farmer and seed expert from the Luqiao Commune in Huangyan County, suddenly received a bag of fine seeds. He thought: Isn't this the bag of fine seeds I gave to Liao Xilong of Pingyang a month ago? Why is it being returned? He hurriedly opened it and saw that the cloth bag contained a new variety sent by Liao Xilong.
    Yang Kuangbao is a famous seed expert, and Liao Xilong is an outstanding model worker. Both are now deputy directors of their respective communes. After the linked competition between Huangyan and Pingyang last year, they established a deep friendship.
    Last June, as the early rice began to flower and head, the fertile fields of Luqiao Commune were lush with rice plants, with large stalks and thick stems. Yang Kuangbao led the guests from Pingyang along the ridges of the rice fields, pointing and introducing: "This field is planted with *Caozi* rice, that field is planted with wheat rice and rapeseed rice. They are transplanted at different times and use different varieties..." Liao Xilong, standing in the crowd, gazed in fascination, watching the rolling rice waves and the healthy plants. He thought, different varieties should be used in different seasons, that makes sense! So he had a detailed conversation with Yang Kuangbao. He told Yang Kuangbao that in the past, their commune used early *Jing* seeds for *Caozi* fields, rapeseed fields, and wheat fields. As a result, most of the early rice in the wheat fields did not grow well and produced grain too early, resulting in very low yields. Everyone blamed the wheat fields for not growing rice well. So that's where the problem lies!
    Liao Xilong brought Yang Kuangbao's experience back to the commune and conveyed it in detail, and the commune members all said it was a good experience. This year, their wheat rice fields have expanded from more than 400 *mu* to more than 1,500 *mu*. The early rice varieties are also the same as Yang Kuangbao's: the earliest early *Jing* is used for *Caozi* fields, and the later-season early *Xian* Nantao No. 1 and Lucai No. 1 are used for rapeseed fields and wheat fields, so that the growing period is longer and more fertilizer can be applied later.
    This spring, with the wheat seedlings green and the rapeseed plants robust, friends from Pingyang came to Luqiao Commune again. Yang Kuangbao and Liao Xilong met for the third time. In the dense wheat fields, Liao Xilong held Yang Kuangbao's hand and asked with a smile, "What is your target for this year?" "At least double. What about you?" Yang Kuangbao replied and then asked back. "The same target!" Liao Xilong said, and then grabbed Yang Kuangbao's hand again. The two expressed that they would compete again this year.
    Liao Xilong has always used Yang Kuangbao as an example to spur himself on. At the end of January this year, representatives of advanced agricultural socialist construction units from all over Zhejiang Province met in Hangzhou, and Liao Xilong and Yang Kuangbao met again. Both showed knowing smiles. Liao Xilong wanted to say to Yang Kuangbao, "You have been to Beijing several times for meetings, but I haven't been there yet! I'm determined to do a good job this year and strive to go to Beijing in the fall to see Chairman Mao." But he never said these words.
    When I visited Liao Xilong, I told him that Yang Kuangbao had written a book on his seed selection experience. Liao Xilong was very happy to hear this. He asked me to send a message to Yang Kuangbao that he would also work hard to learn culture and strive to write a book within two years.
    "Ten Flowers" Vigorously Catch Up with "Seven Fairies"
    Huangyan has the "Seven Fairies," and Pingyang has the "Ten Flowers." In mid-April, at the Wenzhou Special District rice planting competition, both the "Seven Fairies" and the "Ten Flowers" ranked among the best and received awards. Thus, the story of "Ten Flowers" catching up with "Seven Fairies" spread in these two counties.
    The "Seven Fairies" are well-known fast rice planters in Huangyan, ranking first in the county's rice planting competition; the "Ten Flowers" are the banner of Pingyang women, the champions of rice planting among women in the county. On March 15, Huangyan County held a rice planting competition. The "Ten Flowers" sent Zhang Caixia and Zheng Limei, who were the fastest rice planters, to Huangyan to learn. They carefully observed the rice planting of the "Seven Fairies" and kept the rice planting experience of the "Seven Fairies" in their minds; they had a friendly match with the "Seven Fairies." Although they could not beat the "Seven Fairies," they were full of joy because they had learned the rice planting experience of the "Seven Fairies."
    When Zhang Caixia and Zheng Limei returned home, the "Ten Flowers" went to the "training ground" early every day. They treated the open space as rice fields and pine needles as rice seedlings. According to the method of the "Seven Fairies," they planted from left to right and from right to left. Sure enough, the speed was faster than before. When they heard that a rice planting competition was going to be held in the whole special district, they practiced harder every day and competed with each other first. Zheng Jin'e and Zhang Yuxiang also tried planting with cut rice stalks as rice seedlings while firing in the canteen. In just ten days, the speed and quality of their rice planting have improved significantly.
    The "Ten Flowers" participated in the Wenzhou Special District rice planting competition with confidence. Although the results of this competition were still a little worse than the "Seven Fairies," they were already close to the level of the "Seven Fairies."

　　百万农民情谊深
　　本报记者　伊心恬
    相隔五百多里的黄岩和平阳挂钩竞赛一年多来，两个县百多万农民建立了亲密的友谊。现在，这两个县你来我往相互参观的人，经常不断。平阳代表到了黄岩，不论在哪里，都受到了盛情招待；黄岩代表到平阳也处处受欢迎。两县人民在竞赛中建立起来的友谊已开出灿烂的花朵。
    4月下旬，我到平阳、黄岩跑了一圈。两县人民在竞赛中相互学习、你追我赶，相互关心、无私支援，耳闻目见，实在使人又兴奋又感动。
    得到了好法宝
    2月初，黄岩县乌岩公社和路桥公社来了一批客人，他们是平阳县各公社的党委书记和部分生产大队的总支书记。路桥公社党委副书记陈世强向客人们介绍了干部参加劳动、社员参加管理的经验。平阳万全公社城南大队总支书记黄长春越听越有劲，他句句记得牢，听完后还不满足，又跑去问这问那，一点也不放过。他想，我们大队社员生产好，劲头大，就是干部工作多，往往忙得一身汗，群众还是不满意，这一下可找到法宝了。晚上，黄长春和城西大队总支书记廖锡龙睡在一起，两个人一直谈论到深夜。黄长春还仔细考虑回去怎么传达，久久不能入睡。
    黄长春中午回到了家里，立即通知晚上开会。在党的会议上，他原原本本地把脑子里所记的全部说了出来。大家听后，啧啧议论。都说：好经验，好办法，真是个宝！只有三天，这个大队和各生产队的二十九个干部个个参加劳动，各生产队每天抽出一个社员轮流值班，直接参加生产管理工作。干部和社员都感到很满意。
    3月间，中共黄岩县委书记处书记许继良带领的代表团到平阳，访问了城南大队。黄长春介绍说，他们所有干部都参加劳动，和社员一样评工记分，全大队没有一个脱产干部，工作不仅没受到影响，而且更好做了。许继良和代表们认为这也是个宝，也把他们的经验带回去，在全县推广。
    专家模范交朋友
    今年3月初，正当早稻开始播种的时候，黄岩县路桥公社农民种子专家杨匡保忽然接到一袋良种。他想：这袋良种不是一个月前我送给平阳廖锡龙的吗？怎么又退回来了呢？急忙打开一看，原来布袋装的是廖锡龙送来的新品种。
    杨匡保是著名的种子专家，廖锡龙是出色的劳动模范，两人现在都是公社的副主任。在去年黄岩平阳挂钩竞赛后，他们就建立了深厚的友谊。
    去年6月，早稻开始扬花吐穗，路桥公社一片片丰产田稻禾茂密，棵大秆粗。杨匡保带着平阳客人走在稻田埂上，边指点边介绍：这一片是草子田种的，那一片是小麦田、油菜田种的，它们插秧时间不同、用的品种也不同……。人群中的廖锡龙随着杨匡保的手指望去，稻浪滚滚，片片健旺，他看得出神。他想，不同季节要用不同品种，有道理呀！于是找杨匡保详细地交谈。他告诉杨匡保，过去他们社里不管草子田、油菜田、小麦田，都是用的早粳种子，结果小麦田的早稻大多没长齐就先出谷，产量很低，大家还怪小麦田就是种不好水稻。原来毛病出在这里呵！
    廖锡龙把杨匡保的经验带回社里，一五一十地详细传达，社员们都说是好经验。今年他们的小麦田种稻就由四百多亩扩大到一千五百多亩了。早稻品种也和杨匡保那里一样：草子田用最早的早粳，油菜田和小麦田用季节较迟的早籼南特号、陆财号，以便生长期长些，后期可以多施肥。
    今年春天，麦苗碧绿，油菜粗壮，路桥公社又来了平阳朋友。杨匡保和廖锡龙第三次见面了。在茂密的麦田里，廖锡龙握住杨匡保的手，笑着问：“你们今年指标多少？”“至少翻一番。你们呢？”杨匡保回答后反问一句。“一样指标呢！”廖锡龙说完，又拉住杨匡保的手，两人表示今年还要赛一赛。
    廖锡龙一直以杨匡保作为榜样，鞭策着自己。今年1月底，浙江全省农业社会主义建设先进单位代表在杭州会师，廖锡龙和杨匡保又见面了。两个人同时表露出会心的微笑。廖锡龙很想对杨匡保说：“你几次上北京开会，我还没去过呢！今年下决心干好工作，争取秋后上北京见毛主席。”但是这些话始终没说出口。
    当我访问廖锡龙的时候，我告诉他说，杨匡保已把选种经验写了一本书。廖锡龙听了十分高兴，他要我捎个信给杨匡保，他也要努力学文化，争取两年内也写出一本书。
    “十枝花”猛赶“七仙女”
    黄岩出了“七仙女”，平阳有了“十枝花”。4月中旬，在温州专区插秧比巧大会上，“七仙女”和“十枝花”都名列前茅，得到了奖励。于是，“十枝花”赶“七仙女”的故事在这两个县就传开了。
    “七仙女”是黄岩著名的快速插秧能手，全县插秧比巧称第一；“十枝花”是平阳妇女的旗帜，全县妇女的插秧冠军。3月15日，黄岩县举行插秧比巧大会，“十枝花”推出插秧最快的章彩霞和郑李梅到黄岩去学习，她们仔细观摩了“七仙女”插秧，把“七仙女”的插秧经验一一记在心头；和“七仙女”作了一次友谊比赛，虽然比不过“七仙女”，但她们满心欢喜，因为学到了“七仙女”的插秧经验。
    章彩霞和郑李梅回到家，“十枝花”每天一早就上“练武场”了。她们把空地当稻田，松针当秧苗，按照“七仙女”的办法，从左插到右，又从右插到左，果然，速度比以前快起来了。当她们听到全专区要举行插秧比巧的消息后，天天加紧练习，自己先比赛。郑金娥和章余香在食堂烧火时，也用剪短的稻草当秧苗试着插。仅仅十天功夫，她们插秧的速度和质量都显著提高了。
    “十枝花”满怀信心地参加了温州专区的插秧比巧大会。这次比赛结果，虽然还比“七仙女”差一些，但已经接近“七仙女”的水平了。
