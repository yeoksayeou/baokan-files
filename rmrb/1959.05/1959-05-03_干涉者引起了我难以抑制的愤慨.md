I fully endorse the government work report made by Premier Zhou Enlai and the reports made by the two Vice Premiers Li on the 1959 national economic construction plan, the 1958 final financial accounts, and the 1959 financial budget. I resolutely respond to the call to strive to complete and overfulfill this year's national economic plan centered on the four major indicators. The people of the whole country will sincerely admire the glorious contributions made by the Party and the government to the cause of socialism. As a member of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and a scientific and technical worker willing to dedicate everything to the lofty socialist cause of the motherland, I am willing to contribute all my strength to complete this glorious task.

    Hope Indian People Cherish Sino-Indian Friendship

I would like to say a few words about the Tibet issue: When the whole country is vigorously launching a comprehensive leap forward in production and construction that is larger in scale and more magnificent in momentum than last year, a small group of wolfish, evil-doing, religiously disguised upper-class reactionary elements in Tibet, betrayed the motherland and launched an armed rebellion, and kidnapped the Dalai Lama to escape to India. The result of the rebellion, of course, could not escape the people's abandonment and sanctions. It was quelled by the heroic people's army in a few days, allowing the Tibetan people to obtain the true happiness of liberation. Unfortunately, in our neighboring country, there are even people who express sympathy for the rebellious elements and make remarks against our country. These few expansionist elements, stirring up trouble out of nothing, seized the opportunity to undermine the friendship between China and India, and even insulted the images of our leaders in front of our consulate in Mumbai, causing me to feel an uncontrollable indignation in my thoughts and feelings. The occurrence of these things is not only harmful to the friendship between our two countries, but also detrimental to the cause of maintaining world peace.

In the past, when I went abroad to study and returned to China, I had the opportunity to visit India's rich land twice, and I took the opportunity to understand the lives of the people in Mumbai, including the slums and the villas of foreign exploiters. At that time, I felt the tragedy of the common fate of our two major nations suffering from the cruel oppression of imperialism, and I expressed my heartfelt sympathy. I believe that these common experiences can enable the people of our two countries to maintain unwavering unity in the struggle to safeguard world peace and oppose exploitation and oppression. Therefore, I have reason to restrain myself and deeply trust that the foundation of friendship that has been forged between us can withstand any imperialist instigation. I hope the Indian people cherish it.

    Only after Liberation Did I Learn to Apply Knowledge and Participate in the Work of Synthetic Petroleum and Coal Processing

I am a scientific and technical worker and a lover of the motherland. When I was a graduate student in the old society, I felt deeply the imminent danger of the country. I participated in the January 28th Incident in Shanghai, willing to futilely dedicate my humble life to wipe out the national shame. As a result, Chiang Kai-shek compromised and retreated with the 19th Route Army, and I returned in disappointment. After studying in Germany, just as the War of Resistance Against Japan began, I vowed to build a synthetic petroleum industry and coal processing industry for the country to serve the war effort, but due to my personal political ignorance, I mistakenly joined the Chiang regime in Chongqing, and suffered all kinds of despicable blows such as deception, corruption, factionalism, and slander, and as a result, I achieved nothing. In early 1949, a few days after Tianjin was liberated, the Northeast Industrial Department sent someone to find me and called on me to go to the northeast to participate in the restoration of the synthetic petroleum plant. I was indescribably happy at the time, and immediately mobilized and organized manpower to answer the call. Under the wise leadership of the Party, strong support, and cordial care, together with workers and engineering and technical personnel, with the selfless assistance of Soviet experts, we broke through major difficulties such as gasification technology, deep desulfurization technology of gas, synthesis reaction technology, catalyst manufacturing technology, and explosion-proof safety technology, restored the plant, and put it into normal production. After I transferred my work four years ago, this plant continues to develop at a greater speed under the leadership of the plant's Party committee and has become a national synthetic industry base. With the hard and unremitting research and assistance of many petroleum science workers at the Dalian Institute of Petroleum of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, new major achievements have been made in synthetic catalysts and reaction process methods, raising China's petroleum synthesis technology to the international level. After I transferred to work at the Ministry of Petroleum, I participated with many engineering and technical personnel and workers in the long-awaited and dreamed-of restoration, transformation, and construction of other synthetic petroleum industries. In 1958, in the comprehensive leap forward movement led by the Party, I also participated in the construction and production work of the "small-scale indigenous groups" coal-to-oil regional industry and coal comprehensive utilization industry, which were carried out to implement the central government's policy of walking on two legs. Up to now, the state has established various types of synthetic petroleum industrial bases. In the comprehensive utilization of coal in the "small-scale indigenous" industry, thousands of small factories have been built across the country.

From the above fragments of my personal work experience, which I have gained from my personal work posts, and the leaping development of my country's socialist cause in just ten years, it must also be the common experience of tens of thousands of other engineering and technical personnel in various posts. From these common experiences, we deeply realize that under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, we have achieved unprecedented and magnificent great achievements in the struggle of socialist construction! But to transform an old China that was "poor and blank" into a new country that is "flourishing," is not an easy task. Premier Zhou said in his report: Our achievements are enormous. But for a country with a population of more than 600 million, the level of industry and agriculture that our country has reached now is still very low. In order to meet the enormous needs of economic development and the improvement of people's lives, we must continue to work hard. In particular, this year's national economic plan is a further leap forward plan formulated on the basis of last year's great leap forward. To ensure the over-fulfillment of this plan, we must be determined and prepared to pay greater labor than last year.

    Several Key Issues to be Resolved Currently

In order to realize the synthetic petroleum plan and the coal comprehensive utilization task plan in this year's large-scale, high-speed, and still insufficient foundation petroleum industry plan, the relevant scientific and technical workers across the country must continue to fight tenaciously, pursue the victory deeply, and thoroughly solve the following key problems: In terms of synthetic petroleum, it is necessary to solve the two major problems of furnace type transformation and operational innovation, strive to increase the comprehensive oil recovery rate to more than 100%, try to improve the raw material utilization rate as much as possible, strive to use all the raw materials entering the factory for crude oil production, strive to mobilize all crude oil production equipment, and improve the production efficiency (including processing capacity) of the mobilized equipment. This is a very realistic and rapid direction to improve production, and it is necessary to complete the large-scale production tests of scientific achievements that directly serve current production as soon as possible, and obtain reproducible and constant results for production to adopt, such as medium-pressure fluidized bed synthesis, dry distillation of powder and granular raw materials, and large and medium-sized production tests of low-pressure, medium-pressure and semi-high-pressure gas-phase and liquid-phase hydrogenation. In particular, it is hoped that the scientific research units and advanced workers who propose the experimental original data will not only be satisfied with the adoption of the research results, but must be resolutely responsible from beginning to end until large-scale production is completely normal and economically stable, and also often care about the solution of new problems found in production. In terms of comprehensive utilization of coal, the first thing is to solve the normal production of the built equipment and improve the utilization rate of the furnace as much as possible. At the same time, we must firmly grasp and do a good job in the work of serving the four major indicators this year, that is, to improve and ensure the quality and uniformity of semi-coke to serve the steel industry, that is, to quickly turn the tar into light and heavy diesel and lubricating grease that meet the local drainage and irrigation needs to serve agriculture. It is also necessary to use the by-product distilled gas for gas engines and boiler burning to serve the power for the four major indicators. We must immediately come up with ways to solve the problem of labor saving for charging and discharging coke from pile-type distillation furnaces and gas-fired square furnaces. First of all, we must change the unreasonable ones to more reasonable ones, and gradually transform to "foreign methods." The advanced methods such as "high platform, low cargo position" and "slide-board loading and unloading" which are currently being promoted on the transportation front in various places have increased the loading and unloading efficiency by nine times. It is possible to use the terrain, or manually transform the terrain, to adopt them in piled distillation and square furnaces. Some of the above problems have been solved, some are being solved, and some remain to be solved. In addition to the workers who directly participate in this work, who should resolutely take the responsibility of solving them, we also urgently require the relevant departments and scientific and technical units and workers who care about these works to give strong support and active cooperation.

    Hope Relevant Parties Cooperate and Coordinate More

We require cooperation and coordination to solve the following major problems: (1) We request the blast furnace workers of the metallurgical department to promote the use of semi-coke to solve the difficulties of insufficient supply of metallurgical coke and insufficient supply of coking coal and washing coal. We have found the operating methods to improve the quality of semi-coke, and have carried out strict tests with Datong semi-coke in blast furnaces below 50 cubic meters, and achieved completely satisfactory results. Everyone can use it with confidence. If there are any problems in use, we can be responsible for solving them. (2) We request the coal supply department to supply medium-sized lump coal with lower ash content (less than 15%) for the production of semi-coke for blast furnaces and light and heavy diesel and lubricating grease for drainage and irrigation machines. Using coal through comprehensive coal utilization to produce semi-coke, power fuel and boiler gas not only does not increase the burden of coal production, but can save at least 10% to 15% of coal, and can also save coking equipment, coal washing equipment and boiler equipment.

(3) We request the machinery and equipment supply balance department to consider raising its distribution level and give timely and necessary support to the regional coal-to-oil industry based on its significant positive role in the four major indicators this year. (4) We request the national relevant scientific research institutions and scientific workers at all levels to regularly give necessary support to the "small-scale indigenous" coal comprehensive utilization industry, because the "small-scale indigenous" process method is not "indigenous," and the "small-scale indigenous" furnace type is a modern gas heat carrier internal distillation furnace type. Some furnace types also adopt more advanced internal gas combustion principles, such as square furnaces, which also contain quite complex technical heat. At the same time, the use of substitute equipment has brought many new technical topics that need to be resolved. Premier Zhou said in his report: "'Walking on two legs' is our long-term policy for developing industry. Don't underestimate it, underestimation will lead to mistakes." Many of the "small-scale indigenous" factories that have been built in various regions have stopped production due to lack of coal; others cannot be started due to lack of equipment, and most of those under construction and planned have stopped due to lack of equipment and materials. Therefore, we request the relevant departments, provinces, and cities to give necessary encouragement and support based on the role of these small factories in the four major indicators.

Coal is a very large underground resource of the motherland, with reserves of trillions of tons, containing about four or five hundred billion tons of tar and chemicals. The state has attached great importance to the utilization of this resource and actively promoted it. It is hoped that the relevant scientific workers can make outstanding contributions.

    干涉者引起了我难以抑制的愤慨
    赵宗燠委员
    谈西藏问题，并介绍人造石油工业和煤炭综合利用工业的巨大成就
    我完全拥护周恩来总理所作的政府工作报告和两位李副总理所作的关于一九五九年国民经济建设计划，一九五八年财政决算和一九五九年财政预算的报告。我坚决响应为完成和超额完成今年以四大指标为中心的国民经济计划而奋斗的号召。全国人民均将由衷的感戴党和政府对社会主义事业作出的辉煌贡献。作为一个全国政协的成员和一个愿为祖国崇高的社会主义事业献出一切的科学技术工作者，我愿贡献出自己的一切力量来完成这个光荣任务。
    希望印度人士珍视中印友谊
    我对西藏问题说几句话：当全国正在轰轰烈烈展开一个比去年规模还要浩大的、声势还要壮阔的生产建设全面大跃进的时候，我国西藏一小撮豺狼成性、无恶不作、披起宗教外衣的上层反动分子，却背叛祖国，武装叛乱，并劫持达赖喇嘛逃往印度。叛乱结果当然逃不出人民的唾弃和制裁，几天内就被英勇的人民的军队平息，使西藏人民得到真正解放的幸福。不幸的是在我们的邻邦也竟然有人对叛国分子表示同情，并发出反对我国的言论。这些少数扩张主义分子，无事生非，乘机破坏中印之间的友谊，甚而至于在我国驻孟买领事馆前侮辱我们领袖的像片，使我思想感情上感到难于抑制的愤慨。这些事情的发生，既有害于我们两国之间的友情，更不利于维护世界和平的事业。
    我在从前出国留学和返国时期曾两次得机会观光过印度的富饶国土，并且借机了解过孟买城市人民生活，包括贫民窟和外国剥削者的别墅区。我当时感到我们两大民族共同遭受到的帝国主义残酷压迫的命运之悲惨，而深表内心的同情。我以为我们这些共同遭遇可以使我们两国人民在维护世界和平、反对剥削压迫的斗争中能够坚持不渝的团结无间，因此，我有理由克制自己，并深刻信任，我们之间已经结成的友谊基础，能够经受得住任何帝国主义的挑拨离间。希望印度人士珍重为之。
    解放后才学以致用，参加了人
    造石油和煤炭加工的工作
    我是一个科学技术工作者和祖国热爱者，在旧社会学校卒业作研究生时，就痛感国命垂危，曾参加上海“一二八”抗日之战，愿徒然献出区区生命为国家雪耻，结果蒋介石妥协，随十九路军撤退，失望而归。在留学德国后，适值抗日战争开始，矢志为国家建设人造石油工业和煤炭加工工业，为抗战效力，但以个人政治上的愚昧无知，误投重庆蒋政权之下，受尽愚弄、贪污、宗派、谗陷等卑鄙打击，结果一事无成。一九四九年初，天津解放后几天，东北工业部就专人来找我，号召出关参加人造石油厂恢复工作，当时说不出的喜慰，立即动员和组织人力，应召出关。在党的英明领导，大力支持和亲切关怀下，与工人和工程技术人员一起，在苏联专家无私的帮助下，突破了造气技术、气体深度脱硫技术、合成反应技术、催化剂制造技术和防爆安全技术等重大难关，把这厂恢复起来，并投入正常生产。在四年前我调转工作后，这厂继续在厂党委领导之下，正在以更大的速度向前发展，而成为国家合成工业的基地。并在中国科学院大连石油研究所许多石油科学工作者的辛勤不懈的钻研和协助下，在合成催化剂和反应工艺方法上，取得了新的重大成就，把我国的石油合成技术提高至国际水平。我调石油部工作后，与许多工程技术人员、工人一起，参加了多年向往梦寐以求的其他人造石油工业的恢复、改造和新建等工作。一九五八年在党领导的全面大跃进运动中，我又参加了贯彻中央关于两条腿走路的方针政策所开展的“小土群”煤炼油地区工业和煤炭综合利用工业的建设和生产工作。截至目前为止，国家已建立起各种类型的人造石油工业基地。在煤炭综合利用“小土”工业方面，全国已建成了上千的小厂。
  从以上这些个人工作岗位出发所体会到的我国社会主义事业，在短短十年中飞跃发展的片断经历情况，也必然是其他部门成千上万的工程技术人员，在各个岗位上所共同体验到的。从这些共同体验，我们深刻认识到：在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，我们已经在社会主义建设事业斗争中，取得了史无前例、十分辉煌的伟大成就！但要把一个“一穷二白”的旧中国，转变成为一个“花繁叶茂”的新国家，不是一个轻而易举的事。周总理在报告中说：我们的成绩是巨大的。但是对于一个六亿多人口的国家来说，我国工农业现在达到的水平仍然是很低的。为了满足经济发展和人民生活改善的巨大需要，我们必须继续进行艰苦奋斗。尤其是今年的国民经济计划，是一个在去年大跃进的基础上制订的进一步跃进计划，要保证这个计划的超额完成，我们必须下决心，准备付出比去年更大的劳动。
    当前要解决的几个关键问题
  为了实现今年规模宏大、速度很高、而基础还不足的石油工业计划中的人造石油计划和煤综合利用的任务规划，全国有关的科学技术工作者，还必须继续顽强奋斗，乘胜深追，彻底解决以下几个关键问题：在人造石油方面，要解决炉型改造和操作革新两大问题，争取把综合采油率提高到百分之一百之上，要尽量提高原料利用率，把进厂的原料争取全部用于原油生产，要争取把全部原油生产设备动员起来，并把动员起来的设备的生产效率（包括处理量）提高。这是一个非常现实而迅速提高生产的方向，并要尽快地把直接为当前生产服务的科学成就的大型生产试验完成，取得再得性的恒定结果，以便生产采用，如中压流化床合成，粉末和颗粒原料干馏，低压，中压和半高压的气相和液相加氢等大中型生产试验。尤其希望提出试验原始数据的科学研究单位和先进工作者，不单以研究结果被采用为满足，而要自始至终，坚决负责到大生产完全正常生产和经济上占得稳为止，还要经常关心在生产中发现的新问题的解决。在煤炭综合利用方面，首先要解决已建成的设备的正常生产和尽可能提高炉子的利用率，要同时狠狠抓紧和做好为今年四大指标服务的工作，就是要提高和保证半焦质量及其均衡性，来为钢铁服务，就是要把焦油从速变成合乎当地排灌需要的轻重柴油和润滑脂，为农业服务。还要把副产的干馏煤气用于煤气机和烧锅炉，为四大指标动力服务。要立即想出办法解决堆式干馏炉和气燃式方炉的加料和出焦的劳动力节约问题，首先要把不合理的改为较合理的，并逐渐向“洋法”转化。目前正在各地运输战线上推广的“高站台，低货位”及“滑板式装卸”等先进方法，把装卸效率提高了九倍，在成堆干馏和方型炉，都可能利用地形，或人力改造地形后加以采用。以上的问题，一部分已经解决，一部分正在解决，还有一部分尚待解决，除了我们直接参加这一工作的工作者，应坚决负起解决的责任外，还迫切要求有关部门和关心这些工作的科学技术单位和工作者，给以大力支援和主动协作。
  希望有关方面多多协作配合
    我们要求协作配合解决的有如后几项主要的问题：（1）要求冶金部门高炉工作者推广半焦的使用，以解决冶金焦供应不足和炼焦煤、洗煤供应不足的种种困难。我们已找出提高半焦质量的操作方法，并用大同半焦在五十立方公尺以下的高炉中进行了严格的试验，取得完全满意的结果。大家可以放心使用。使用中如有问题，我们可负责解决。（2）要求煤炭供应部门供应灰分较低（小于百分之十五）的中块煤，以作生产高炉用半焦和排灌机用轻重柴油及润滑脂之用。把煤通过煤综合利用以生产半焦、动力燃料和烧锅炉的煤气，不特不增加煤炭生产的负担，反而可以节煤至少百分之十到十五，还可以节省炼焦设备、洗煤设备及锅驼机设备。
  （3）要求机械和器材供应平衡部门，根据地区煤炼油工业对今年四大指标的重大积极作用，应考虑提高其分配等级，给以及时必要的支援。（4）要求国家有关的各级科学研究机关和科学工作者，经常给“小土”的煤综合利用工业以必要的支援，因为“小土”的工艺方法不“土”，“小土”的炉型是近代化的气体热载体内式干馏炉型，有些炉型还采用更先进的内气燃原理，如方型炉，所包含的技术热亦颇复杂。同时由于采用了代用器材，带来了许多新的技术课题，均待解决。周总理在报告中说：“‘土洋并举’是我们发展工业的长远方针，千万不要小看，小看就会犯错误。”目前各地区已建成的“小土”厂，有不少因缺煤停产；另一些因缺设备不能开动，正在建的和计划建的大都因器材设备无着停止。因此要求有关部、省、市根据这些小厂对四大指标的作用，给以必要的鼓励和支持。
    煤是祖国十分浩大的一个地下资源，储量有若干万亿吨之多，所含焦油及化学品约有四、五千亿吨。国家已十分重视这一资源的利用，而加以积极提倡。希望有关的科学工作者能作出出色的贡献。
