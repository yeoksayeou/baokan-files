Everyone Prepare to Pickle Vegetables

People eat vegetables every day. With the continuous improvement of living standards, people's need for vegetables has greatly increased. Under these circumstances, how to ensure that people have an adequate supply of vegetables throughout the year is a major issue in organizing people's lives. This is not just an economic issue, but also a political one, and we must treat this work with a high degree of political enthusiasm.

This year, all regions have expanded the planting area of vegetables according to the principle of local production, local supply, zoned planning, and contracted supply. The growth of vegetables is generally good, and it is expected that the output of vegetables and the quantity of commercial vegetables will further increase this year. However, in most parts of China, the peak season for vegetables is generally in June and July. During this period, vegetables are often left uneaten and rot, while there is a shortage of vegetables in the off-season. To properly regulate the supply of vegetables between peak and off-seasons, we must establish the concept of the peak season taking care of the off-season, summer and autumn taking care of winter and spring, and this year taking care of next year. Starting from ensuring the normal supply of vegetables throughout the year, we should welcome the arrival of the peak vegetable production season and seize the important link of vegetable storage and processing as early as possible, so as to supplement the off-season with the peak season and ensure the normal supply of vegetables throughout the year. This work is particularly necessary in densely populated large and medium-sized cities and industrial and mining areas.

It is not enough to rely solely on commercial departments for vegetable processing and storage. We must mobilize the masses, rely on the masses, and get everyone involved. In addition to the people's communes and operating departments processing and storing vegetables, we must also vigorously organize collective units such as government offices, organizations, factories, schools, and troops, as well as urban and rural residents, to adopt various methods to process and store vegetables. The Beijing Municipality's policy of "urban and rural areas moving together, with both public and private sectors participating" is entirely correct.

In terms of vegetable processing and storage technology, relevant departments in various regions have a lot of experience. The broad masses of people in rural and urban areas have the habit of drying and pickling vegetables for many years. Relevant departments in various regions should promptly summarize and adopt diverse methods for technical exchange. The equipment required for vegetable processing and storage should be based on the spirit of making do with whatever is available, making full use of existing equipment in urban and rural areas, and processing as much as possible during the peak season. All newly built and existing pickle gardens should be filled with cellars, ponds leveled, and jars and pots filled. In order that the broad masses of people can regularly eat delicious vegetables even in seasons when vegetables are not produced.

The season is urging people, and the peak vegetable season is coming soon. Let everyone take action, and prepare to store and pickle vegetables as soon as possible!

    大家都来准备腌蔬菜
    人们天天都要吃菜，随着生活水平的不断提高，人们对蔬菜的需要量大大增加。在这种情况下，如何让人们一年四季都有适量的蔬菜吃，这是组织人民生活中的一件大事，这不仅仅是个经济问题，而且是政治问题，我们要以高度的政治热情对待这个工作。
    今年各地都根据就地生产、就地供应、按区划片、包干供应的方针，扩大了蔬菜播种面积。蔬菜生长情况，一般良好，预计今年蔬菜产量和商品蔬菜的数量将有进一步的增长。但是，我国多数地区的蔬菜旺季，一般都是在6、7月份。在这期间，菜往往吃不了烂掉扔掉，而淡季又缺菜吃。要使淡季旺季的蔬菜供应调剂得宜，必须树立旺季照顾淡季、夏秋照顾冬春、今年照顾明年的观点，并从保证蔬菜全年的正常供应着眼，迎蔬菜生产旺季的到来，及早抓住蔬菜储存加工这一重要环节，做到以旺补淡，保证全年蔬菜的正常供应。这一工作在人口集中的大、中城市和工矿区尤为必要。
    蔬菜加工储存单纯靠商业部门是不够的，必须发动群众，依靠群众，大家动手。除人民公社和经营部门要加工储存外，还要大力组织机关、团体、工厂、学校、部队等集体单位以及城乡居民采取各种办法加工贮存蔬菜。北京市采取“城乡齐动，公私并举”的方针，完全正确。
    在蔬菜加工储存技术方面，各地有关部门有不少经验。农村和城市广大群众历年来有晒菜、腌菜的习惯。各地有关部门应该及时加以总结，采取多种多样的方法，进行技术交流。蔬菜加工储存所需要的设备，应该本着因陋就简的精神，充分利用城市农村现有设备，在旺季尽量加工，所有新建的、旧有的酱菜园都要窖满、池平、缸罐充实。以便广大群众在不生产蔬菜的季节，也能经常吃到可口的蔬菜。
    节令催人，蔬菜旺季很快即到，大家都来动手，及早准备储存和腌制蔬菜吧。
