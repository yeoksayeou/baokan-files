Comrade Chen Heqin's Speech

Chairman, esteemed members:

I fully endorse Premier Zhou Enlai's government work report, as well as the reports made by Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen.

Recently, I accompanied the delegation of National People's Congress deputies and CPPCC members to inspect the construction of water conservancy projects on the Grand Canal, the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production, and the development of people's communes in the Yangzhou, Huaiyin, Nantong, and Suzhou regions of Jiangsu. Last year, in September and October, I visited ten newly established people's communes in the Xu and Huai areas. Later, I visited several people's communes in the suburbs of Nanjing. This time, in Nantong, I saw the pilot program of urban people's communes for the first time and was very excited. Now, I will introduce how the residents of Nantong City, under the leadership of the Party, have organized themselves to actively develop production for your reference.

Pilot Commune Establishment

The pilot program for establishing urban people's communes in Nantong City. Nantong City is a medium-sized industrial city. Its area is only 116 square kilometers, and its population is just over 270,000, with the urban and suburban areas being almost equal. In 1958, with the nationwide Great Leap Forward, Nantong's industrial production also developed rapidly, growing from 60 factories to 288. Due to the Great Leap Forward in industry and agriculture, there was an unusual shortage of labor. Therefore, farmers in the suburbs and residents in the urban area of Nantong City established people's communes, which greatly liberated labor, especially women's labor productivity. How exactly did Nantong City's urban residents participate in the pilot program for people's communes to solve the labor problem? Through the publicity and education of the Party's general line for building socialism and the mass rectification movement, the awareness of the residents was generally raised. In the situation of the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the Party put forward the call for the whole people to run industry, and the street offices also mobilized the masses to establish some industries. At that time, it was based on the residents' committees. It was still impossible to comprehensively allocate labor, and production equipment could not be fully utilized. Technical strength was weak and scattered, collective welfare undertakings were difficult to carry out, and women's labor was unable to be liberated from the constraints of trivial housework. Therefore, industry could not develop well. Under Chairman Mao's instruction that "People's communes are good," the broad masses of people enthusiastically demanded the establishment of people's communes to solve the various contradictions existing in the people-run industries, change the face of the city, and promote the development of productive forces.

In late August 1958, under the leadership of the Party, extensive and in-depth publicity and education on the superiority of people's communes was carried out among the masses. Then, a preparatory committee for the establishment of people's communes was formed by comrades from the street offices and representatives of local residents to start preparations. Residents were excited when they heard the news, spreading the word and singing and dancing, applying to join the commune one after another. For example, Chen Lianying, a resident of Northeast Road, said: "The people's commune is really good. Everyone participates in production, and there are no idlers in any household. The benefits for women are endless. With canteens and nurseries, there's no need to take care of children or burn stoves, make shoes or mend socks. From now on, women can jump out of the small family circle." Under the correct leadership of the Municipal Party Committee and with the enthusiastic support of the broad masses of residents, the first pilot people's commune in the city was established in less than half a month.

People-Run Industry

After the establishment of the people's commune, social labor and means of production were arranged and deployed on a larger scale. Industry and health and welfare undertakings were further developed. For example, with regard to people-run factories, after the establishment of the commune, they increased from nine to a total of 84 factories, workshops, and processing groups. In addition, three sideline production teams and a breeding farm were established. The number of employees expanded from 260 to 7,957, eliminating unemployment. Many means of production were changed from being scattered to being concentrated, fully exploiting the utilization rate of equipment and greatly improving labor productivity.

How exactly are people-run factories run, and how have they developed? First of all, under the leadership of the Party, the Nantong people-run factories correctly implemented the policy of serving large-scale industry, serving the mechanization and electrification of agriculture, and serving the masses. From the perspective of products, there are those that serve large-scale industries such as steel, cement, machinery, textiles, and pharmaceuticals. For example, the lead wire weaving, shuttle, glass product, cork product, and sandpaper factories produce lead wire screens, weaving machine shuttles, glass storage containers, bottle stoppers, and sandpaper. There are those that manufacture and repair agricultural machinery for agricultural mechanization and semi-mechanization, such as the hardware repair factory we inspected, which produces earth bearings and repairs agricultural machinery. There are also direct current radios, gloves, scarves, fabrics, silk floss, soda, soap, toys, etc. that are produced for the needs of the people's lives, as well as hexagonal lead wire mesh, corrugated fasteners, glutinous rice paper, and other export commodities.

It is understood that in vigorously engaging in production and vigorously engaging in welfare, many difficulties were encountered, such as a lack of funds, equipment, and technical strength, and insufficient production and living space. At that time, under the leadership of the Party, the residents followed the mass line, implemented the Party's complete set of guidelines of going from nothing to something, from small to large, from indigenous to foreign, and learning from indigenous methods to create foreign methods to overcome difficulties and develop production and welfare undertakings. Moreover, the development speed of some factories was amazing. For example, the hardware factory we inspected initially had only one borrowed pliers, and six people used 60 yuan of funds to produce in a nine-square-meter house. When we inspected it, the situation was completely different. The hardware factory already had 285 employees, and although the factory building was still not large enough, there were already eleven large and small workshops. The equipment was much more abundant than before: there were three lathes, one planer, fifteen punches, one saw, and five motors. The product range was greatly expanded, export commodities were manufactured, and the output value was constantly increasing. The output value in the second quarter of last year was more than 29,000 yuan, and in the first quarter of this year it was more than 72,000 yuan, an increase of 140 percent.

Another example is the cotton weaving factory. At the beginning, only a few women liberated from their families participated, and they were all "new hands" who did not know how to weave. When we inspected it, there were already more than 130 skilled workers. The factory was built in the old City God Temple. When it was founded, it had nothing. The workers made demands, fought hard for three months without wages, and as a result, they started receiving subsidies after one month. Now, the average monthly wage is 18 yuan, and the quantity of products has also greatly increased. In March of this year, the task was overfulfilled, with a total of 1,384 pieces of cloth woven.

All the people-run factories in Nantong grew and expanded after the establishment of the commune, just like the hardware factory and the cotton weaving factory. The total industrial output value of the entire commune in the second quarter of last year was 32,134 yuan. By the fourth quarter, the output value had reached 579,620 yuan, which was 18 times the output value of the second quarter before communization. On the basis of the Great Leap Forward last year, this year all the industrial workers of the commune enthusiastically launched a socialist labor competition, with everyone striving to be advanced and competing to be advanced, and holding a "nine comparison" challenge, which stimulated the labor enthusiasm of the commune members and further improved production labor efficiency. The industrial output value in the first quarter reached 648,561 yuan, an increase of 10 percent over the fourth quarter of last year, making a greater effort for the industrialization of the country and the industrialization of the commune.

Collective Welfare

Collective welfare undertakings are inseparable from the development of socialist production. To liberate women's labor, it is necessary to run collective welfare undertakings, such as: public canteens, nurseries, kindergartens, etc. Women account for the majority of urban residents. According to incomplete statistics, women account for 78.88 percent of the more than 12,000 residents in Nantong City. In order to thoroughly liberate women from busy housework and the burden of children, the establishment of public canteens and the establishment of nurseries and kindergartens have become necessary conditions. Therefore, the commune began to set up public canteens and run nurseries and kindergartens. It is understood that, so far, the commune has a total of 85 public canteens, with 16,488 people eating in the canteens (of which about 44 are non-members). There are a total of 54 nurseries and kindergartens, with 2,083 children being cared for, including three full-time kindergartens with 550 children, and the number is constantly growing. The home for the elderly is still managed by the Municipal People's Committee.

We visited the 38th public canteen, known as the "Nanyuan Canteen," which won the competition red flag, and we were very satisfied. It is said that the "red flag competition" is held regularly to exchange experiences. The "Nanyuan Canteen" is run the most perfectly. Now, we will introduce some of the advantages we saw for your reference:

(1) Establish the viewpoint that the canteen serves production.

To establish the viewpoint that the canteen serves production, first of all, through the study of the people's commune documents and the political education on the importance and necessity of running a good canteen, all the staff of Nanyuan put politics in command, and everyone is not afraid of difficulties, works hard, works practically, works skillfully, and uses their brains to do a good job in the catering work, so that the commune members feel that they eat better than at home. Yao Shunlin, an old cook who is 75 years old, although old, is full of energy and made 80 kinds of dishes in half a day to pay tribute to the Party Congress. When we visited, we saw that the menu for the day was indeed "rich and varied": there were 16 kinds of meat dishes and 13 kinds of vegetarian dishes, and the prices were also very cheap, with the lowest being only three cents each and the highest being no more than 25 cents. This is one of the reasons why it is very popular among the masses.

(2) Doing a good job in sideline production is a necessary way to improve meals.

All the staff of Nanyuan Canteen vigorously develop sideline production in order to improve meals, meet the needs of the masses, and strive to become self-sufficient in all vegetarian dishes as soon as possible. Therefore, all the staff were mobilized to collect seeds in many ways, and to level, cultivate, and weed gardens, open spaces, roadsides, threshing grounds, and in front of and behind houses. Now, about twelve acres of vegetable land have been planted. We inspected everywhere and saw that cabbage, mustard, and radishes had all grown tender and lovely, and various melons and beans had been sown. In addition, several types of fish are raised in the fish pond, and it is said that there are as many as 20,000 fish. Six pigs are raised in the pigsty, and the canteen is also preparing to raise 200 chicks. These measures are of great benefit to improving meals.

(3) Implement the principle of combining collective and individual freedom.

On the one hand, commune members use grain coupons to buy rice and money to buy vegetables. It is convenient for each person to eat in the canteen or take it back to their own home. On the other hand, patients, the disabled, the elderly, and women in childbirth are given considerable care.

(4) Management work can also be both democratic and centralized:

First of all, establish a democratic management committee, everyone participates in the management of the canteen, fully develops democracy, achieves that everyone is responsible for everything, and everyone is responsible for things, holds a meeting of all staff once a week, and regularly holds a meeting of democratic representatives to absorb the opinions of the masses, and constantly summarizes experience and improves work.

Secondly, establish four canteen systems: (1) grain and oil management system, (2) meal ticket dining system, (3) financial disclosure system, (4) security system. Due to the establishment of the democratic management committee, these points have been achieved, thereby improving the enthusiasm of the staff and playing a decisive and active role in improving meals and improving work in a timely manner.

Again, pay attention to hygiene: In order to ensure the health of the commune members, keep the indoor and outdoor clean, and all tableware is disinfected every day before use to meet the requirements of sterilization. Tables and chairs are free of dust and are thoroughly washed every half month to ensure that the interior is clean on all six sides, the exterior is free of garbage and weeds, and there is no sewage. Drinking water is disinfected in every tank and uses filtered water, so that the canteen achieves cleanliness and hygiene like a hospital. We believe that all of the above has been done in practice after our visit.

Initial Successes

In the past six months, the urban residents' people's commune pilot program in Nantong City has achieved certain results. As a pilot program, it is exploring an experience for running people's communes in urban areas. Since cities are different from rural areas, and the situation in cities is more complicated than in rural areas, the people of Nantong City, under the leadership of the Party, first organized the urban residents to actively develop production and strive for the construction of socialism. Since its establishment in September last year, the urban residents' commune pilot program in Nantong City has demonstrated the great superiority of the commune.

(1) The residents', especially the women's, labor force has been liberated; socialist productive forces have been developed. Of the more than 270,000 people in Nantong City, the more than 140,000 people in the suburbs established three Red Flag People's Communes. Of the more than 135,000 people in the urban area, excluding the staff of organs, factories, schools, and enterprises, as well as minors and the elderly, there are 26,647 people, including 10,221 men and 16,426 women. All the labor force has participated in production, which is a huge social change for the residents' labor force, especially the women's labor force. There has been a shift from scattered to collective, from unorganized production methods to socialist production methods, and some people who originally relied on relief to live are now able to support themselves. The greatest change in production relations is the women who used to rely on others for food, were around the stove, and were caring for children. Today, they are fighting side by side with men on the production front, exerting full effort, and building socialism quickly, well, and economically.

(2) Increase income for individuals and create wealth for the country.

It is understood that in the past six months, the total industrial output value of the urban residents' people's commune pilot program in Nantong City was more than 840,000 yuan, and in the first quarter of this year, it was more than 640,000 yuan. Judging from the current production development situation and the labor enthusiasm and soaring energy of the commune members, the total industrial output value in the remaining three quarters of this year will definitely have greater growth.

Looking at the income of the commune members' individual wages: in the second quarter of last year, before the establishment of the commune, the total wages issued in the entire commune area were 1,734 yuan. In the fourth quarter, after the establishment of the commune, the wages issued were 111,820 yuan, which was 64 times the total wages issued before communization. In the first quarter of this year, the wages issued reached 145,500 yuan, an increase of 30 percent over the fourth quarter of last year. The average wage of each commune member participating in labor production is about 15 yuan. More than 90 percent of the commune members have increased their income and improved their lives. Due to the development of production, relief households have basically been eliminated among the residents. Because the commune members are in a happy mood and their lives are getting better day by day, they are even more energetic. For example, in Sijie Street, there is a 62-year-old Wangjia mother who works as an auxiliary worker in the canteen. After receiving her first ten yuan wage, she was extremely happy and said: "I am 62 years old this year, and I didn't expect to have a job and get paid. In the past, I always stayed at home to cook and take care of children, and I always had to ask my husband or daughters and sons for money. I always felt a little sad in my heart. Today, I received my salary, which I never thought of. I organize commune members in the commune to go to the countryside to pick cotton and support agricultural production. Although I have a boil on my neck today, picking cotton is light labor, and I still want to do it." This shows that the liberation of women's productive labor, on the one hand, will establish their sense of self-esteem, and on the other hand, will unleash their soaring energy to build socialism.

(3) Political awareness has been greatly improved, and the spiritual outlook has undergone tremendous changes.

After the establishment of the people's commune, people's ideological awareness has been further improved, and they can actively participate in various movements. For example, during the great steel campaign last year, thousands of commune members enthusiastically fought day and night beside the blast furnace or took turns participating in the labor of knocking ore and refractory mud. During the great machinery campaign, the commune members brought waste copper and scrap iron to sell or donate to the country.

With the development of production and the increase in income, the relationship between people has been greatly improved. Old bad habits have disappeared, and the spiritual outlook has greatly changed. For example, in the Nanchengmen area, 31 civil disputes occurred in November and December 1957, including 2 marriages, 2 child support cases, 4 household affairs, 6 debt cases, and 15 house cases. After the establishment of the commune, no disputes occurred. Neighbors who had not spoken for many years reconciled, and families who often quarreled became harmonious. The unity of the people has been strengthened. The imperialists insisted that we destroyed the family system. In fact, we have established a democratic and united big family.

Whether the above is accurate is subject to correction.

    南通市城区居民怎样组织起来发展生产
    陈鹤琴委员的发言主席、各位委员：
    我完全拥护周恩来总理所作的政府工作报告，和李富春、李先念副总理、彭真副委员长所作的报告。
    最近，我随着全国人民代表和政协委员视察团到江苏、扬州、淮阴、南通和苏州各专区视察大运河修建水利工程，工农业生产大跃进，以及人民公社发展情况。去年九、十月间我曾在徐、淮地区参观了刚刚成立的十个人民公社；后来，我又在南京郊区参观了几个人民公社；这次，我在南通第一次看到了城区人民公社试点的情况，感到很兴奋。现在我把南通市城区居民怎样在党的领导下，组织起来，积极发展生产的情况介绍出来，以供大家参考。
    建社试点
    南通市城区居民建立人民公社试点情况。南通市是一个中等小型工业城市。它的面积不过一百一十六平方公里，人口也不过二十七万多点，城区和郊区几乎各半。一九五八年随着全国生产大跃进的形势，南通工业生产也飞跃地向前发展，由六十个工厂发展到二百八十八个工厂。由于工农业大跃进，劳动力就感到异常缺乏。因此，南通市郊区农民和城区居民就建立了人民公社，大大解放了劳动力，特别是妇女劳动生产力。南通市城区居民究竟怎样参加人民公社试点来解决劳动力问题呢？通过党的建设社会主义总路线的宣传教育和全民性整风运动，居民觉悟有了普遍的提高。在一九五八年大跃进的形势下，党提出了全民办工业的号召，街道办事处也发动了群众，创办了一些工业。当时是以居民委员会为单位。劳动力仍不可能全面调配，生产设备不可能充分利用；技术力量薄弱分散；集体福利事业难以开展；妇女劳动力在繁琐的家务劳动牵累下不能得到解放。因此，工业不能很好的发展起来。在毛主席的“人民公社好”的指示下，广大群众热烈要求建立人民公社，以解决民办工业中存在
  的各种矛盾，改变城市面貌和促进生产力的发展。
    一九五八年八月下旬，在党的领导下，人民公社的优越性在群众中进行了广泛的、深入的宣传教育，接着以街道办事处的同志和地区居民代表组成了建立人民公社的筹备委员会，着手筹建。居民们听到这个消息奔走相告，情绪高涨，载歌载舞，纷纷申请入社，如东北马路居民陈莲英说：“人民公社真正好，人人参加生产，户户没有闲人，妇女的好处更是说不完，有了食堂，托儿所，不带孩子，不烧炉子，不做鞋子、不补袜子，从此妇女跳出家庭小圈子。”在市委的正确领导下，由于广大居民的热烈拥护，不到半个月的时间，第一个人民公社试点在该市建立起来了。
    民办工业
    人民公社建立后，社会劳动力和生产资料得到更大的安排和调度。工业和卫生福利事业进一步得到发展。比如民办工厂，公社建立后就由九个增加到大小工厂、工场以及加工小组共八十四个，另外还建立了三个副业生产队，一个饲养场；职工队伍由二百六十人扩展到七千九百五十七人，消灭了失业现象，不少的生产资料由分散到集中，充分发挥了设备利用率，大大提高了劳动生产效力。
    民办工厂究竟怎样办的，怎样发展起来的？首先，南通市民办工厂在党的领导下，正确贯彻了为大工业服务，为农业机械化、电气化服务，为群众服务的方针。从产品上看，有为钢铁、水泥、机械、纺织、制药大工业服务的，如铅丝编织、梭子、玻璃制品、软木制品、砂皮等厂生产的铅丝筛子、布机梭子、玻璃贮器、瓶塞、砂皮等；有为农业机械化、半机械化制造修配的，如我们所视察的五金修配厂生产的土轴承和农业机械的修理等，还有如直流收音机、手套、围巾、布匹、丝棉、石碱、肥皂、玩具等为人民生活需要而生产的产品以及六角铅丝网、瓦轮丁、糯米纸等出口商品。
    据了解，在大搞生产、大搞福利时也遇到了不少困难，如缺乏资金、设备和技术力量，生产、生活用房不够使用等等。当时居民在党的领导下，走群众路线，贯彻党的从无到有，从小到大，从土到洋，土中出洋等两条腿走路的一整套方针，克服了困难，发展了生产和福利事业，而且有的工厂发展的速度是惊人的。如我们所视察的五金工厂，开始建厂时只有一个借来的钳子，六个人以六十元的资金在九平方公尺的房子里进行生产，到我们视察时，情况完全不同了。五金工厂职工已有二百八十五人了，厂房虽然还是不大够用，但已有大小十一个车间了，设备上比以前充足得多了：有车床三台，刨床一台，冲床十五台，锯床一台，马达五只，产品大大扩增，制造了出口商品，产值也正在不断上升，该厂去年第二季度为二万九千多元，今年一季度就为七万二千多元，增长百分之一百四十。
    又如棉织厂，开始时，从家庭解放出来的少数妇女参加，她们都是“生手”，不会织布的。我们视察时，已有一百三十多个熟练工人，建厂是在旧城隍庙里。创办时，一无所有，工人提出要求，苦战三个月，不要工资，结果一个月以后，就发津贴，现在每月平均工资十八元，产品数量也大大提高，今年三月份就超额完成任务，共织成了一千三百八十四匹布。
    南通全体民办工厂建社以后和五金厂、棉织厂一样地成长壮大起来。全社去年第二季度工业总产值计三万二千一百三十四元，到第四季度，产值即达到五十七万九千六百二十元，为公社化前二季度产值的十八倍。在去年大跃进的基础上，今年全社工业职工热烈展开了社会主义的劳动竞赛，人人做先进，个个争先进，大摆“九比”擂台，激发了社员的劳动热情，进一步提高了生产劳动效率，一季度工业产值就完成六十四万八千五百六十一元，比去年第四季度增长百分之十，为国家工业化、公社工业化作出了更大的努力。
    集体福利
    集体福利事业与发展社会主义生产是分不开的。要解放妇女劳动力，必须举办集体福利事业，如：公共食堂、托儿所、幼儿园等。城市居民中妇女要占大多数，据不完全的统计，南通市一万二千多个居民中，妇女占百分之七十八点八八。为了彻底把妇女从繁忙家务和小孩牵累中解放出来，公共食堂的设置，托儿所、幼儿园的创办，就成为必要的条件。因此，该社就开始进行设置公共食堂，举办托儿所和幼儿园。据了解，到现在为止，该社共有八十五个公共食堂，就膳人数达一万六千四百八十八人（其中约四十四人系非社员）。托儿所、幼儿园共五十四个，受托儿童为二千零八十三人，其中全托幼儿园三个，受托儿童五百五十人，还在不断增长。敬老院一所现仍由市人委管理。
    我们参观了夺得竞赛红旗的第三十八所公共食堂，简称“南园食堂”，感到非常满意。“红旗竞赛”据说是经常定期举行，以交流经验为目的。“南园食堂”办得比较最完善。现在把我们所看到的几个优点，介绍出来以供参考：
    （一）树立食堂为生产服务的观点。
    树立食堂为生产服务的观点，首先，通过人民公社文件的学习和办好食堂的重要性和必要性的政治教育，南园工作人员人人政治挂帅，人人不怕困难，苦干、实干、巧干、动脑筋、找窍门，搞好伙食工作，使社员们感到比在自己家里吃得还好。年已七十五岁的老炊事员姚顺林同志年纪虽大，干劲冲天，在半天内做出八十种菜向党代会献礼。我们参观时看见当天中午菜单，确是“丰富多采”：荤菜有十六样，素菜有十三样，价钱也很便宜，最低的只三分钱一样，最高的也不过二角五分钱，这是大受群众欢迎的原因之一。
    （二）搞好副业生产是改善伙食的必要途径。
    南园食堂全体工作人员大力发展副业生产，以期改善伙食，满足群众的需要，争取早日全部素菜自给，因此发动了全体工作人员多方面收集种子，平填、耕锄园地、空地、路边场边、屋前屋后等处，现已种了约十二亩菜地，我们到处巡视了一下，看见了小白菜、芥菜、萝卜都已长得幼嫩可爱，还有各种瓜类、豆类已下了种子，此外，鱼塘里养着几种鱼类，听说有二万尾之多，猪圈里养猪六头，食堂还准备养小鸡二百只。这些措施对于伙食的改善是有很大的利益的。
    （三）贯彻集体与个人自由结合的原则。
    一方面社员用粮票买饭，用钱买菜。在食堂里吃或者拿回去在自己家吃都听各人的方便，另一方面，病员、残废的、年老的、产妇都得到相当的照顾。
    （四）管理工作也能做到既民主又集中：
    首先，建立民主管理委员会，大家参加食堂管理，充分发扬民主，达到事事有人负责，人人对事负责，每周召开一次全体工作人员会议，定期召开民主代表会吸收群众意见，随时总结经验和改进工作。
    其次订立食堂四个制度：（1）粮油管理制度，（2）饭菜票就膳制度，（3）财务公开制度，（4）保卫制度。由于民主管理委员会的建立，做到这几点，从而提高了工作人员的积极性，对改善伙食及时改进工作起了决定性的积极作用。
    再次，注意卫生工作方面：为了保证社员身体健康，做到室内外清洁，餐具天天在未用前全部进行消毒，达到符合杀菌的要求，桌凳无灰尘，半个月彻底大洗一次，做到室内六面光，室外无垃圾杂草、无污水，饮水做到缸缸消毒，用过滤水，使食堂达到清洁卫生医院化。以上这些，我在参观了之后，我们认为都是确实做到的。
    初见成效
    半年来，南通市城区居民人民公社试点是取得一定成绩的。作为一个试点，它是正在摸索一条城区办人民公社的经验。由于城市与农村有所不同，城市情况比农村复杂，南通市人民首先在党的领导下把城区居民组织起来，积极地发展生产，为建设社会主义而奋斗。从去年九月间成立以来，南通市城区居民公社试点已显示出公社的巨大的优越性。
      （一）解放了居民的特别是妇女劳动力；发展了社会主义的生产力。南通全市二十七万多人口中，郊区十四万多人成立了三个红旗人民公社，城区十三万五千多人，除机关、工厂、学校和企业职工以及未成年的和年老的外，有二万六千六百四十七人，其中男一万零二百二十一人，女一万六千四百二十六人，全体劳动力都参加了生产，这对于居民劳动力特别是妇女劳动力是一个巨大的社会变革；有从分散走到集体的，有从无组织的生产方式走到社会主义生产方式，有部分原来靠救济生活今天能自食其力了。生产关系中变革最大的要算一向靠人吃饭、围着炉灶、带着孩子的妇女们，今天与男子在生产战线上并肩作战，鼓足干劲，多快好省地建设社会主义。
      （二）为个人增加收入，为国家创造财富。
    据了解，在过去六个月中，南通市城区居民人民公社试点所举办的工业总产值为八十四万多元，今年第一季度就为六十四万多元，照目前生产发展情况以及社员劳动热情，冲天干劲情况看来，今年余下的三个季度的工业总产值一定有更大的增长。
    以社员个人工资的收入来看：去年第二季度公社建立以前，全社地区发出的工资是一千七百三十四元，第四季度公社建立以后发出的工资是十一万一千八百二十元，为公社化前发出的工资总数的六十四倍；今年一季度发放工资达十四万五千五百元，比去年第四季度又增长了百分之三十，参加劳动生产的每个社员平均工资在十五元左右，百分之九十以上的社员增加了收入，改善了生活。由于生产的发展，目前居民当中基本上消灭了救济户。社员们由于心情舒畅，日子过得一天好一天，干劲都更足了。如寺街，有个六十二岁的王家妈妈，在食堂做辅助工，第一次得到十块钱工资后，她高兴极了，说：“我今年六十二岁，没有想到有工作做，还有工资拿，过去一直在家做饭、带孩子，要钱总是向丈夫或女儿、儿子要，自己心里总有点难过，今天拿到工资，这是我从来没有想到过的。我在社里组织社员下乡拾棉花，支援农业生产，我今天颈上虽然生了一个疖子，拾棉花是轻微劳动，我还是要做的。”这说明，妇女的生产劳动力的解放，一方面会树立起她们的自尊感，同时会发挥出她们的冲天干劲来建设社会主义。
    （三）政治觉悟有了很大的提高，精神面貌有了巨大的改变。
    人民公社建立后，人们的思想觉悟有了进一步提高，对各项运动都能积极参加。如在去年大搞钢铁时，数以千计的社员都热情地夜以继日战斗在高炉旁边或者轮流参加敲矿石、耐火泥等劳动，大搞机械时，社员们都纷纷肩抬手提的把废铜烂铁出售或献给国家。
    随着生产事业的发展和收入的增加，人与人之间的关系大为改善。旧有的恶习已经绝迹，精神面貌大为改观。如：南城门地区一九五七年十一和十二两个月发生民事纠纷三十一件，其中婚姻二件，抚养二件，家务四件，债务六件，房屋十五件。公社建立后，就没有发生任何纠纷。多年来没有说话的街坊和好了，经常吵架的家庭和睦了，人民内部团结加强了。帝国主义者硬说我们破坏了家庭制度，其实，我们建立了民主团结的大家庭。
    以上所说，是否确当，尚希指正。
