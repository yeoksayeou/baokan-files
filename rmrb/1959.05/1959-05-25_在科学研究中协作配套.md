    Collaborative Support in Scientific Research
    Jin Wen
    How to better combine scientific research with production practice is a matter of great concern to both scientific research departments and production departments. The Shaanxi Provincial Science and Technology Commission's organization of scientific research departments, universities, and research institutions in factories and people's communes to collaboratively conduct complete sets of scientific research is a good method and a good experience.
    This method is called "collaborative support." Its first advantage is its broad scope of collaboration, involving both research departments and production departments; both foreign methods and local methods; precise large instruments and crude, simple local equipment can all play a role; veteran experts and young production experts can all contribute their abilities. This kind of collaboration is very powerful and conducive to the more, faster, better, and more economical production of results in scientific research.
    Secondly, the advantage of this collaboration also lies in its ability to promote the completion of scientific research sets. Scientific research, in some respects, is the same as production, that is, it must be complete. If this issue is not paid attention to, if there are large ones but no small ones, if there are main ones but no auxiliary ones, or if only the results of the laboratory are paid attention to, and not the promotion and application in production workshops and large-scale field production, the practical effect of this research in production will be reduced. The advantage of the collaborative support research method is that from the beginning, it can target the problems raised in production practice, plan complete sets according to local conditions, research complete sets, and finally obtain finished products in complete sets. Such research results can naturally be immediately promoted and applied in production.
    The need for completion is determined by the characteristics of production itself. Because production practice is complex and diverse, a production activity is related to a series of scientific and technological problems, large and small, complex and simple, all in sets, which need to be solved in complete sets, with nothing missing. In the past, some scientific research work often advanced in a single discipline, only studying a certain problem in a certain production, or a certain aspect of a certain problem, or a certain section of a certain aspect, or even smaller. As a result, production problems often cannot be solved comprehensively. (There are many exceptions for some cutting-edge scientific research. It will not be discussed here for the time being.) Now, the scientific community in Shaanxi Province, in response to this contradiction, and in response to the needs of production practice for completion, cooperatively conducts complete sets of scientific research, which can eliminate this contradiction between the two, can be better combined, and twisted into one rope.
    The main task of the people of the whole country at present is to increase production and practice thrift, achieve high quality and high output, and strive to complete production tasks. Scientists have also repeatedly proposed to dedicate their efforts to this great national task. It can be imagined that in the process of completing this great task, various scientific and technological problems, large and small, will be constantly raised, and need to be solved in a timely manner. If, like the scientific community in Shaanxi Province, we strengthen collaboration, and concentrate our main forces to quickly solve any key scientific and technological problems raised in current production practice in complete sets, then the effect of scientific research will be even greater.

    在科学研究中协作配套
    金文
    如何使科学研究和生产实际更好地结合起来，这是科学研究部门和生产部门极为关心的问题。陕西省科学工作委员会组织各科学研究部门、高等学校和工厂、人民公社的研究机构，协作进行成套的科学研究，这是一条好办法，好经验。
    这种办法，人们称它为“协作配套”。它的好处首先是协作面广，既有研究部门，又有生产部门；有洋办法、也有土办法，精密的大仪器、粗简的土设备都可以发挥作用，老专家、年青的生产能手都可以各尽所能。这种协作，力量很大，有利于科学研究的更多更快更好更省地产生效果。
    其次，这种协作的好处，还在于可以促进科学研究配起套来。科学研究，在某些方面同生产是一样的，就是必须配套，如果不注意这个问题，有大的没小的，有主的没副的，或者只注意实验室的成果，不注意在生产车间和大田生产中推广应用，这种研究在生产中的实效就会减低。而各方面协作配套的研究方法的好处，就在于一开始就可以针对生产实际中提出的问题，因地制宜地成套地计划，成套地研究，最后成套地得到成品。这样的研究成果，自必可以马上在生产中推广应用。
    需要配套，这是生产本身的特点所决定的。因为生产实际是复杂多样的，一项生产活动关系到一系列的科学技术问题，有大有小，有繁有简，都是一套一套的，需要成套地解决，缺一不可。过去，有一些科学研究工作往往是单科独进，只研究某项生产中的某一个问题，或某一问题中的某一方面，或某一方面的某一段工作，甚至更小。结果往往不能全面解决生产问题。（对一些尖端科学研究来说，是有很多例外的。在这里暂不论述它）现在，陕西省科学界针对这种矛盾，针对生产实际需要的配套，协作进行成套的科学研究，就可以消除二者之间的这种矛盾，可以结合得更好，拧成一根绳。
    当前全国人民的主要任务是增产节约，优质高产，力争完成生产任务，科学工作者们也一再提出要为这全民性的伟大任务献出力量。可以设想，在完成这伟大的任务中，会不断地提出各种各样的、大大小小的科学技术问题，而且需要及时得到解决。如果像陕西省科学界那样，加强协作，当前生产实际中提出什么关键性的科学技术问题，就集中主要力量，迅速地成套地加以解决。那末，科学研究的效果就会更大。
