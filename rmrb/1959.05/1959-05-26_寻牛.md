　　The night was already deep. Du Chaozhen, the ox feeder of the Fourth Team, woke up and wanted to throw some grass to the oxen. She turned over, got out of bed, put on her clothes, fumbled for a match, and with a "crack," lit the oil lamp. She had just pulled open the bolt and opened the door to go out when the night wind rushed in, blowing out the oil lamp with a whoosh. She looked up at the sky, where the round moon was hidden in the whitish clouds, and the earth was shimmering. She put the extinguished oil lamp on the ground and quickly walked towards the ox pen. She walked into the pen and looked around, but it was silent, as if the ox wasn't in the pen.

　　She groped around the pen for a long time but couldn't find it. She quickly turned and ran back to her room, brought a match, lit the oil lamp again, and saw that the ox was indeed not in the pen. She trembled all over, feeling anxious, and ran out hurriedly, shouting, "The ox has run away! Oh my god! What are we going to do! Hurry, hurry..." Her hoarse voice cried out repeatedly in alarm.

　　People who were sleeping soundly were awakened. Hearing someone shouting outside, they quickly got up and stumbled out, asking, "Du Chaozhen, has your 'Old Liu' run away?" Everyone was talking at once, and no one could figure out what was going on.

　　Du Chaozhen's lover, Liu Jianchuan, was also awakened. He ran out of bed: "Are you seeing ghosts? I was still sleeping in bed, and you said I ran away..."

　　Cook Pan Shijie woke up from his dream and heard the commotion outside. He quickly got out of bed, grabbed a stick at random, and ran towards the crowd: "Where is the fire?"

　　"Who are you asking about?" Du Chaozhen saw that many people had gathered around and were asking irrelevant questions. She didn't know what was going on.

　　"You're shouting, but you don't know what's happening. Are you crazy?" "Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha!" There was laughter and anxiety.

　　"Where is the house on fire?" Pan Shijie asked anxiously, jumping up and down.

　　"What are you doing? My ox has run away. Please, help me find it! Oh my god, what if it tramples the commune's crops! Help me find it! Hurry..." Only then did Du Chaozhen explain that "the ox has run away."

　　"Oh! The ox has run away. It's our fault for not hearing clearly!"

　　Du Chaozhen said, "I was so anxious that I didn't explain properly. It's not your fault!"

　　Pan Shijie interjected, "Don't say anymore, forget it! Let's go and help her find the ox..."

　　A string of dark figures searched east and west along the road, but they couldn't find any sign of the ox.

　　As they passed Turtle Fort, they heard a "哗哗" sound of water. Everyone ran towards the sound, and when they looked up, they saw that it was County Party Secretary Teng, holding a whip and the tail of a plow, plowing the field with a "?, ?."

　　Everyone greeted him, "Secretary Teng, you're plowing the field?"

　　"Yes! Plowing the field. What are you doing here?"

　　"Du Chaozhen's ox has run away, and we're helping her find it."

　　"Look, is this the ox I'm using to plow?"

　　Everyone looked at it and said, "Yes!"

　　"Hahaha!" Secretary Teng laughed and said, "I brought it here to plow the field."

　　Du Chaozhen interjected, "Secretary Teng, you brought it here? You gave me such a fright! Why didn't you say anything?"

　　"If I woke you up in the middle of the night, wouldn't that disturb your sleep?" Everyone argued, "Secretary Teng, you're working too hard. Let me plow!"

　　"No! I'll plow, you go home to sleep."

　　"No! We'll plow, you go back to sleep." Everyone was arguing in the field.

　　Secretary Teng said, "Don't argue! I haven't learned well yet, and I can't delay you during the day. If you want to plow, go get another ox and plow, okay?"

　　Everyone agreed in unison, "Okay! Okay! Let you learn to plow properly..."

　　Du Chaozhen said with a smile, "Now I can rest assured!"

    寻牛
    徐珩光
    夜，已经深了。四区队耕牛饲养员杜朝珍一觉醒来，要去丢牛草，她翻身起床，披上衣服，摸着火柴，咔察一声，点了油灯。她刚把门闩抽开，开门出去，夜风迎面扑来，呼的一声，就把油灯吹熄了。她抬头望望天上，圆圆的月儿藏在鱼白色的云头，一片大地亮沙沙的，就把吹熄了的油灯放在地上，赶紧朝牛圈屋里走去。她走进屋四处一看，不响不动，牛不在圈里似的。
    她满屋子摸了许久，却没找着，才连忙转身跑进她房里去，带来火柴，又把油灯点起，一看，硬是牛不在圈里了。她浑身打颤，心里着急，飞踏踏的一趟跑出去，喊道：“刘（牛）跑不见了，天啦！怎么得了哇！快点，快……”嘶哑的嗓子连二赶三的惊叫起来。
    正在沉睡的人都惊醒了，听到外面有人喊，连忙爬起来，踉踉跄跄跑出来清问：“杜朝珍，你屋‘老刘’跑了呀？”七嘴八舌的，谁也搞不清楚。
    杜朝珍的爱人刘建川也惊醒了，从床上跑出来：“你闯了鬼呀？我还在床上睡起的，你说我跑了……”
    炊事员潘世杰从梦中醒来，听到外面闹成一片，也连忙爬起床来，乱抓了一根棒子拿在手头，一股劲朝人面前跑：“哪里烧起来了？”
    “你们在问哪一个哟？”杜朝珍看到很多人都跑拢来了，问得来牛头不对马嘴。她不知道是什么一回事。
    “你又在喊，你又不晓得，你癫了哇？”“哈，哈，哈，哈，哈！”又是笑又是急。
    “哪里房子烧起火来了？”潘世杰急得直跳。
    “你们是做啥子的？我的牛跑不见了。快点，请你们帮我找一下吧！天啦，把社的庄稼踏了，怎么得了呵！帮我找一下吧！快点……”杜朝珍这时才把话说明：是“牛跑不见了。”
    “哦！是牛跑不见了，怪我们没有听明！”
    杜朝珍说：“我急倒了，没有说圆，字没叫明，怎么怪得着你们呵！”
    潘世杰一嘴接过去说：“莫说了，算了！我们快去帮她找牛……”
    路上一串黑簇簇的人，东寻西找，好大一阵都没找到牛影。
    一走过乌龟堡，传来“哗哗”一片水声。大家朝着水响处一趟跑拢去，抬头一看，原来是县委滕书记，手执鞭子和犁头尾巴，“?，?，?”的在犁田。
    大家一齐打招呼：“滕书记，你在犁田呀？”
    “嗯！犁田。你们跑来干啥？”
    “杜朝珍的牛跑了，我们帮她找牛。”
    “你们看，我犁的这头牛是不是？”
    大家看了看说：“是！”
    “哈哈哈！”滕书记笑了笑说：“是我牵来犁田来了。”
    杜朝珍一嘴接过去说：“滕书记，是你牵来了？吓我这一大跳！你做啥子不说一声嘛？”
    “深更半夜喊你，岂不误了你们的睡眠吗？”大家争着说：“滕书记，你太辛苦了，快让我来犁吧！”
    “不！我犁，你们回家睡觉去。”
    “不！我们犁，你回去睡觉。”大伙都在田里争起来了。
    滕书记说：“你们都不要争！我还没学好，白天又不能耽误你们，你们要犁，另外去牵牛来犁，好不好？”
  大家齐声应承：“好！好！让你好好学犁吧……”
    杜朝珍笑眯眯的说：“这下我放心了！”
