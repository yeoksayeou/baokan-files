Moscow, May 1st (By our own correspondent) - The Soviet people celebrated the first "May Day" Labor Day of the Seven-Year Plan with particularly joyous spirits today. As the spring night enveloped the city, Moscow's streets were illuminated with festive lights as dense as stars. The beams of searchlights lit up Red Square as bright as day, and thousands of people gathered at the foot of the Kremlin walls, waiting to watch the festive fireworks. Melodious music echoed in the Manege Square, where young men and women in festive attire danced gracefully. A performance stage was erected in front of the Central Exhibition Hall, where amateur song and dance groups from factories and schools performed wonderful programs. The saying "Art belongs to the people" has become a reality in the Soviet Union. Many actors from private troupes came to the streets today to dedicate their art to the laborers celebrating the festival. Not far from the city center, in a square, large-scale propaganda paintings promoting the "Seven-Year Plan" were hung, and strings of electric lights outlined inspiring figures. A novel embellishment on the Garden Ring Road particularly attracted people's attention: a wooden arrow rushing upwards, launching a space rocket into the sky, with eight hundred small electric lights flickering on and off, making the transparent "space rocket" twinkle in the night sky. The Lenin Hills in the southwestern district, sixty meters above the Moscow River, are always lively during festivals, and tonight was especially so. In the evening, thousands of Muscovites took the subway and buses to get here, all wanting to enjoy the "May Day" night in Moscow from a high vantage point. In the bustling crowd, songs, accordion music, and unrestrained cheers of joy merged into one.

	At exactly nine o'clock, the twenty fireworks cannons lined up at the foot of Lenin Hills, together with the whole city, set off beautiful fireworks, and colorful sparks illuminated the Moscow night sky.

	Many Muscovites like to spend the festive night in the famous Gorky Park. Before dark, people streamed across the Crimean Bridge spanning the Moscow River towards Gorky Park. Tonight, this is the most concentrated place for various artistic activities. As soon as you enter the park, you can see colorful strings of electric lights hanging in the bushes.

	The fountains made of moving neon lights in the square emitted wonderful brilliance. Many girls and young men like to flock to the most lively open-air dance floor and open-air concerts, where they can dance to their heart's content or enjoy some pleasant song and dance programs. The elderly sit on wooden chairs along the tree-lined avenues, happily talking about their happy lives, and the children like to drag their parents to watch interesting and thrilling motorcycle wall-riding performances. It is full of optimistic youthful vitality everywhere, and everywhere shows the upsurge of the cultural life of the Soviet working people.

    莫斯科的“五一”节之夜
    本报莫斯科1日电　苏联人民今天以特别愉快的心情度过了七年计划的第一个“五一”劳动节。这一天，当春天的夜晚笼罩了城市以后，莫斯科的街道上亮起了密如繁星的节日的灯火。探照灯的光芒把红场照得亮如白昼，克里姆林宫的墙下聚集了成千上万的人群，他们在等待着观看节日的焰火。骑兵操练广场上响着悠扬的音乐，穿着节日服装的男女青年翩翩起舞。中央展览厅门前搭起了表演台，来自工厂和学校的业余歌舞团体表演着精彩的节目。“艺术属于人民”这句话，在苏联已经变成现实。许多民办剧团的演员们今天来到了街头，他们把自己的艺术献给欢庆节日的劳动者。离市中心不远的一个广场上，悬挂着大幅宣传“七年计划”的宣传画，一串串的电灯镶出了振奋人心的数字。花园环行道上有个新颖的点缀，格外吸引人们的注意，一个木制的飞奔向上的箭头把宇宙火箭抛向高空，八百颗小电灯忽明忽灭，透明的“宇宙火箭”在夜空中闪闪烁烁。高出莫斯科河六十公尺的西南区，列宁山在节日里一向是非常热闹的，今夜尤其热闹异常。傍晚，成千上万的莫斯科人乘着地下电车、公共汽车来到这里，人们都想在这里居高临下地欣赏莫斯科“五一”之夜。在熙攘的人群里，歌声、手风琴声、尽情的欢乐声汇成一片。
    九点正，排列在列宁山下的二十门放焰火的炮，同全市一起放出了美丽的焰火，五光十色的火花照亮了莫斯科的夜空。
    许多莫斯科人喜欢在著名的高尔基公园度过节日的夜晚。天还没有黑，人们就川流不息地顺着横跨莫斯科河的克里木桥涌向高尔基公园。今晚，这里是各种艺术活动最集中的地方。一进公园，就可以看到挂满在树丛中彩色缤纷的成串电灯。
    广场上用活动霓虹灯装成的喷泉发出奇妙的光彩。许多姑娘和小伙子都喜欢涌到最热闹的露天舞池和露天音乐会去，那里可以尽情地跳个痛快，或是欣赏一些愉快的歌舞节目。上了年岁的老人，都坐在林荫道两旁的木椅上，他们都乐的笑呵呵地谈论着幸福的生活，孩子们喜欢拉着爸爸妈妈去看有趣而惊险的摩托车走壁表演。这里到处充满着乐观青春的活力，到处可以显示出苏联劳动人民文化生活的高涨。
