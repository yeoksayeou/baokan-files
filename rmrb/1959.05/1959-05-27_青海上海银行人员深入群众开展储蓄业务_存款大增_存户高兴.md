    Qinghai Shanghai Bank Personnel Go Deep into the Masses to Develop Savings Business
    Deposits Increase Greatly Depositors are Happy
    (Our dispatch from Xining, May 26) According to the principle of "voluntary deposit, free withdrawal," bank departments in Qinghai Province have adopted a variety of methods to facilitate people's savings deposits, making savings deposits steadily increase year by year. By the end of 1958, the savings deposit balance of people of all ethnic groups in the province had increased more than 37 times compared with the end of 1952. The savings deposits in the first four months of this year were greatly increased compared with last year. The balance of urban savings deposits alone increased by about 10% compared with the net increase of similar deposits at the end of last year.
    Qinghai Province has a vast area and a sparse population. Except for Xining City and agricultural areas where the population is relatively dense, the population in other areas is very sparse, and the residents are scattered. Some (such as geological exploration personnel) also move frequently. In view of this situation, the staff of the Qinghai Branch of the People's Bank of China put forward the slogan "Wherever there are people, savings personnel will follow." Now, their savings business has spread all over the province. In the Qaidam Basin, in the Tanggula Mountains, in the Qilian Mountains, and in the vast pastoral areas, there are People's Bank institutions, and more than 2,400 agents and assistant savings workers have been specially invited to help handle savings business in various places.
    In handling savings business, they also adopted the method of relying on the masses to run the savings business and going deep into the masses to understand the masses, absorbing a large amount of social idle funds. Bank savings staff, in going deep into the masses, understand the various savings requirements of the masses, and they try to meet these requirements. For example, some people are unwilling to go to the bank to deposit money because they find it troublesome, so they go to their homes to handle savings procedures. If some people need money but cannot go to the bank to withdraw money due to something, as long as they make a phone call to the bank, the bank will immediately send someone to deliver the money to the depositor.
    They have also made many improvements in the savings procedures for the convenience of the masses. They not only open their doors every day and do business all year round, so that the masses can go to the bank to deposit or withdraw money every day, but also ensure that they can deposit and withdraw money at any time. People hand the money or deposit slips/books to the savings staff, and the savings staff adopt the method of one person handling everything, and quickly complete the procedures, changing the past process of requiring accounting review and cashier etc., thereby greatly shortening the time for handling savings procedures. Fixed deposits that are not yet due can also be withdrawn in advance at any time. No matter how much the deposit amount is, even a few cents can be deposited.
    (Our dispatch from Shanghai, May 26) The vast number of workers and residents in Shanghai enthusiastically participate in savings. Since March, the city's savings amount has been increasing month by month. As of May 22, the total remaining balance of deposits has reached 572,160,000 yuan, a net increase of 28,830,000 yuan.
    In the past few months, many factories, organizations, and residential organizations in Shanghai have strengthened the education of the masses on thrift in managing their families and running enterprises. Many factories often use report meetings, discussion meetings, and political classes in spare-time universities to explain to workers the significance of actively saving to support national construction and arrange their own economic lives well. Propaganda teams composed of People's Bank staff also frequently go deep into the neighborhoods to conduct savings propaganda in the form of Yue opera, crosstalk, and quick board storytelling. Workers and residents have realized that saving is not only beneficial to the country, but also beneficial to themselves, and have actively participated in saving. Now, more than 80% of the workers in the flax spinning workshop of State-owned Cotton Mill No. 9 and the third workshop of Shanghai Steel Plant No. 2 have participated in saving.
    In order to facilitate savings for workers and residents, the Shanghai People's Bank has established a large number of savings agencies in factories and organizations throughout the city, and has established more than 490 service stations in cooperation with neighborhood organizations. Residents can deposit and withdraw money nearby. The service stations also pay utility bills, rent, and deliver newspapers for residents, which is very popular among the masses. In the Luwan District, shortly after the establishment of service stations by two residents' committees on Shunchang Road, the number of people participating in saving accounted for 80% of the residents in the area.

    青海上海银行人员深入群众开展储蓄业务
    存款大增  存户高兴
    本报西宁26日电  青海省银行部门根据“存款自愿，取款自由”的原则，采取多种多样便利群众储蓄存款的办法，使储蓄存款历年来稳步直线上升。1958年底全省各族人民的储蓄存款余额已比1952年底增加了三十七倍多，今年头四个月的储蓄存款，又比去年大为提高，仅城市储蓄存款部分的余额，即比去年年底同类存款净增约10％。
    青海省地区辽阔，人口稀少，除西宁市和农业区的人口比较稠密以外，其他地区的人口都很稀，居住也较分散，有的（如地质勘探人员等）还经常流动，根据这个情况，中国人民银行青海分行的职工提出“哪里有人，储蓄人员就跟到哪里”的行动口号。现在，他们的储蓄业务已遍及全省各地。在柴达木盆地，在唐古拉山，在祁连山以及广大牧业区等地，都设有人民银行机构，并在各地特邀了代办员和协储员二千四百多人，帮助办理储蓄业务。
    在办理储蓄业务当中，他们还采取了依靠群众办储蓄事业和深入群众、了解群众的办法，吸收了大量的社会游资。银行的储蓄员在深入群众中，了解群众的各种各样有关储蓄的要求，他们就设法满足这种要求。如有的人不愿意到银行去存款，嫌麻烦，他们就到家里去办理储蓄手续，有的人需用钱，但因有事不能去银行取款，只要给银行打个电话，银行马上派人把钱送到存户的手里。
    在群众储蓄的手续上，他们也作了很多改进，因而便利了群众。他们不仅作到天天开门，常年营业，使群众天天都可到银行存钱或取款，而且作到随到、随存、随取。人们把钱或存单、存折交给储蓄员，储蓄员就采取一人一手清的办法，很快就给办好了，改变了过去要经过会计复核、出纳等过程，从而大大缩短了办理储蓄手续的时间。不到期的定期存款，也可随时提前支取。存款额不论多少，就是几角钱也可立户存入。
    本报上海26日电  上海广大职工和居民踊跃参加储蓄。3月份以来，全市储蓄金额月月上升，到5月22日止，存款总余款已达五亿七千二百十六万元，净增加了两千八百八十三万元。
    这几个月来，上海市许多工厂、机关和居民组织加强了对群众进行勤俭治家、勤俭办企业的教育。不少工厂经常利用报告会、讨论会和业余大学的政治课，向职工说明积极储蓄对支援国家建设和安排好自己经济生活的意义。人民银行职工组成的宣传队，也经常深入里弄，用越剧、相声、快板等文艺形式进行储蓄宣传。职工和居民们体验到储蓄不但有利于国家，也有利于自己，纷纷参加储蓄。现在，国棉九厂麻纺车间和上钢二厂三车间参加储蓄的职工已经达到80％以上。
    上海人民银行为了便利职工和居民储蓄，在全市工厂、机关建立了大批储蓄代办所，并配合里弄组织设立了四百九十多个服务站，居民可以就近存款、取款。服务站还代居民缴水电费、房租、送报纸，很受群众欢迎。芦湾区顺昌路的两个居民委员会，在服务站成立后不久，参加储蓄的人就占这个地区居民的80％。
