(New Delhi Dispatch) The "Tribune" published a commentary on the 5th written by its editor, Prem Bhatia, entitled "Spurious Concern for Buddhism."

He wrote: "I think it is unfortunate and unwise that we emphasize the religious aspect in our concern for the Dalai Lama. To repeatedly say that China's attitude towards Tibetan autonomy is a threat to Buddhism is inappropriate and not entirely true."

"My real feeling is that since the beginning of the Tibetan rebellion, our enthusiasm for Buddhism has been excessive in recent weeks. Most of us are aware of this, but still allow ourselves to be dominated by popular slogans and perhaps unconscious political motives. When the atomic bomb was dropped on Japan, we Indians were naturally unhappy, but our concern was not caused by the fact that the bomb killed thousands of Buddhists. When France bombed Indochina, we were not very worried about the deaths of Buddhists either. Let's face the facts and be honest with ourselves."

He said, "In my opinion, we are also wrong in disrespecting Mao Zedong. Obviously, this rash action was done by a small group of people in Bombay, but there is no doubt that this incident seriously offended Beijing."

The editor believes that "to convince ourselves that our entire position on Tibet is correct would be extremely conceited and could lead to repeating certain mistakes."

### 印度“论坛报”发表文章指出  不应指责中国威胁佛教

    印度“论坛报”发表文章指出
    不应指责中国威胁佛教
    本报讯　新德里消息：“论坛报”在5日刊登了该报主编普雷姆·巴蒂亚所写的一篇题为“对佛教的虚伪关切”的评论。
    他写道：“我认为，在我们对达赖喇嘛的关怀方面强调宗教的方面是不幸的和不明智的。一再重复说中国对西藏自治的态度是对佛教的威胁，这是不适当的，也是不完全真实的。”
    “我的真正的感觉是，自从西藏叛乱开始以来，在最近几个星期，我们对佛教的热情是过份了。我们当中大部分人也知道这一点，但是仍然允许自己被流行的口号以及也许是无意识的政治动机所支配。当原子弹投在日本的时候，我们印度人自然是不愉快的，但是我们的关切并不是由于炸弹炸死了成千的佛教徒这一点而引起的。在法国轰炸印度支那的时候，我们也没有很担心佛教徒的死亡。让我们面对事实，对自己老实。”
    他说：“在我看来，我们在对毛泽东表示不尊重这方面也错了。显然这个轻率的行动是孟买的一小撮人干的，但是毫无疑问，这次事件严重地得罪了北京”。
    这位主编认为，“要使我们自己相信我们对西藏的整个立场是正确的，那将极其自以为是的，并且可能导致重犯某些错误。”
