    Successful Design of Variable Focal Length Photographic Lens
    Motion picture and television photography urgently need a "variable focal length photographic lens" to replace a series of photographic lenses with different focal lengths. The First Research Office of the Chinese Academy of Sciences' Institute of Optics and Fine Mechanics has recently completed the design of such a variable focal length photographic lens.
    Since beginning this research in November of last year, the scientific personnel of the First Research Office of the Institute of Optics and Fine Mechanics encountered many difficulties and failed many times. After the third failure, they summarized their experience, studied and decided on several plans, and concentrated their main force to launch the most vigorous offensive. After more than a week of hard work, they finally completed the design victoriously.

    变焦距摄影镜头设计成功
    电影摄影和电视摄影急迫需要一种“变焦距摄影镜头”，以代替一系列的不同焦距的摄影镜头。中国科学院光学精密机械仪器研究所第一研究室最近完成了这种变焦距摄影镜头的设计。
    光学精密机械仪器研究所第一研究室的科学工作人员从去年11月开始进行这项研究以后，碰到过不少困难，失败了多次。在第三次失败以后，他们总结了经验，又研究决定了几个方案，集中主力展开了最猛烈的攻势。经过一个多星期苦战，终于胜利地完成了设计。
