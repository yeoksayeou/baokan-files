Xinhua News Agency, 5th. Basic construction investment contracting is a good method for correctly handling financial relationships in basic construction and should be further implemented in the future. This was the conclusion reached at a recent meeting of the Ministry of Finance on basic construction financial appropriations.

The representatives attending the meeting summarized the experience of implementing the investment contracting system in the past period, affirming that this system is an effective measure for implementing the Party's general line of socialist construction in basic construction, and also a good method for vigorously carrying out mass movements in basic construction and fully mobilizing the enthusiasm of the masses.

Basic construction investment contracting means that, on the premise of ensuring project quality, not reducing production capacity, not delaying the completion date, not exceeding the total investment amount, and not increasing the proportion of non-productive construction, the basic construction investment is handed over to the construction departments and units for unified control, self-arrangement, and contracted use. If the contracting is done well and less investment is spent, the state will not take it back, and the construction unit will use the investment saved to expand production.

According to incomplete statistics, there are now 1,270 construction units across the country implementing investment contracting, of which 526 construction units have saved about 30% of the original planned investment on the premise of ensuring that production capacity is not reduced and project quality is not reduced. The vast majority of the funds saved have been used to increase productive construction projects in accordance with the requirements of the national economic development plan.

The implementation of investment contracting has prompted construction departments and construction units to more conscientiously implement the principles of building the country diligently and thriftily, combining indigenous and foreign methods, and combining large, medium, and small construction projects. They save investment for the state and accelerate construction speed by rationally arranging investment, adjusting construction projects, revising design quotas, reducing non-productive construction, and reducing construction costs. For example, according to the original plan, the Guangdong Jiangmen Sugar Chemical Plant required the state to invest 12 million yuan. The competent authority only approved 9.5 million yuan. After implementing contracting, in addition to increasing production capacity by 25% to complete the construction task, it also added a plasticizer plant with an annual output of 17,000 tons. Another example is the Qinghe Reservoir project in Liaoning, for which the state approved an investment of 118 million yuan. After implementing contracting, only 65 million yuan is needed, and the construction period can be shortened by one and a half years.

This system has also fully mobilized the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses of workers and staff. For example, after the Shenyang Metallurgical Machinery Plant implemented investment contracting, all the workers and staff in the plant launched discussions, fully tapped internal potential, used the method of "ants gnawing at bones" to manufacture 50% of the equipment themselves, reduced external orders, and saved a lot of funds. They also revised some unreasonable design quotas. In this way, the total investment amount was reduced from 12.21 million yuan before contracting to 8 million yuan, the factory output increased by one time than the original plan, and the construction period was shortened from one year to half a year.

After the implementation of investment contracting, the relationship between construction units and construction enterprises has also been greatly improved. In the past, Party A and Party B often restrained each other, affecting work; now, Party A discloses the investment amount, and Party B discloses the actual cost of the project, and the two parties cooperate very closely.

The investment contracting system has been supported by party and government departments at all levels because it meets the requirements of the great leap forward in basic construction. Party and government leaders in many places personally preside over investment contracting meetings or organize on-site meetings to promote advanced experience. Now, the People's Committees of Guangdong, Guangxi, Hubei, Gansu and other provinces and autonomous regions have issued notices on the comprehensive implementation of the investment contracting system. The central competent departments, such as the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, Coal Industry, Chemical Industry, Petroleum Industry, Railways, First Ministry of Machine Building, Ministry of Water Resources and Electric Power, and Ministry of Construction Engineering, have also made specific arrangements, requiring their subordinate units to fully implement the investment contracting system.

### 基本建设投资包干是好办法  财政部召开会议决定进一步推行这个制度

　　基本建设投资包干是好办法
    财政部召开会议决定进一步推行这个制度
    新华社5日讯　基本建设投资包干，是正确处理基本建设中财务关系的一个好办法，今后应当进一步贯彻实行。这是最近财政部召开的基本建设财务拨款会议上得出的结论。
    出席会议的代表总结了过去一个时期实行投资包干制度的经验，肯定了这个制度是在基本建设中贯彻党的建设社会主义总路线的一项有效措施，也是便于在基本建设中大搞群众运动，充分发挥群众积极性的一种良好办法。
    基本建设投资包干，就是在保证工程质量、不降低生产能力、不推迟交工日期、不突破投资总额和不增加非生产建设比重的条件下，把基本建设投资交由建设部门和单位，统一掌握，自行安排，包干使用。包得好的，投资少花了，国家不收回，由建设单位把节约下来的投资，使用到扩大生产上去。
    据不完全统计，现在全国已有一千二百七十个建设单位实行了投资包干，其中有五百二十六个建设单位在保证不降低生产能力、不降低工程质量的前提下，节约了占原计划30％左右的投资。节约下来的资金，绝大部分都根据发展国民经济计划的要求，用在增加生产性的建设项目上。
    实行投资包干，促使建设部门和建设单位更加认真地贯彻勤俭建国、土方法和洋方法并举，大中小建设项目并举等方针，从合理安排投资、调整建设项目、修改设计定额、削减非生产性建设、降低造价等方面为国家节约投资，加快建设速度。如广东江门甘蔗化工厂按照原计划，要求国家投资一千二百万元，主管部门只批准九百五十万元，实行包干后，除了增加生产能力25％完成建设任务外，还增建了一个年产一万七千吨的塑化剂厂。再如辽宁清河水库工程，国家批准投资金额为一亿一千八百万元，实行包干以后，只需要六千五百万元，而且工期可以缩短一年半。
    这个制度还充分调动了广大职工群众的积极性和创造性。如沈阳冶金机械厂实行投资包干后，全厂职工展开讨论，充分挖掘内部潜力，用蚂蚁啃骨头的方法，自己制造了50％的设备，减少对外订货，节约了大量资金，他们还修改了一些不合理的设计定额。这样，总投资额由包干以前的一千二百二十一万元降低到八百万元，工厂产量比原计划增加了一倍，工期从一年缩短到半年。
    实行投资包干以后，建设单位和建筑企业之间的关系也有很大改善。过去甲、乙双方之间经常互相牵制，影响工作；现在，甲方公开投资额，乙方公开工程实际成本，双方合作得很密切。
    投资包干制度由于适合基本建设大跃进的要求，因此得到各级党政部门的支持。许多地方的党政领导人，亲自主持投资包干会议，或者组织现场会议，推广先进经验。现在，广东、广西、湖北、甘肃等省、自治区人民委员会，都发出了全面实行投资包干制度的通知。中央主管部门如冶金、煤炭、化工、石油、铁道、第一机械、水利电力、建筑工程等部，也作了具体布置，要求所属单位全面实行投资包干制。
