Old Workers Fiercely Attack Cultural Fortresses
Seizing Every Minute

It was past 2:00 AM, and He Xuexin was still sitting in bed studying, wrapped in his coat. Why was he studying so diligently?

He Xuexin is the Party Branch Secretary of the Tool Workshop at the Jiangling Machine Factory. One evening, after reviewing the work summary with the workshop's management cadres, he felt that he had not clearly analyzed the key experiences in the summary. He was dissatisfied with himself. He thought, how could he lead a workshop of over a thousand people if he didn't intensify his studies! From then on, he resolved to work hard at learning culture. Since he started learning culture in 1954, he has truly persisted for five years, studying diligently every night after all the lights in the village had been extinguished.

He Xuexin always seized every minute when studying, just like when he was working. For example, when he went to see a movie, he would seize the few minutes before and after the screening to study algebra formulas and examples. He even treated reading a document or listening to a report as a language lesson.

He Xuexin was originally a poor peasant. When the factory leadership promoted him from an old inspector to head of the General Affairs Section in 1951, he couldn't understand documents, didn't know how to approve them, and couldn't even write a coherent sentence. But he didn't give in to difficulties. Although he was forty years old, he signed a teaching contract with young men in their twenties, becoming their "primary school student." Now, He Xuexin has reached the junior high school level.

After He Xuexin's cultural and theoretical level improved, his leadership level also greatly improved. Now, his reports and written documents are logical and well-organized, and are very popular with the workers. The workers' education work in the Tool Workshop under his leadership is also considered the best in the entire factory. He not only cares about the workshop's production, but also takes the time to personally supervise and help workers who have difficulties in their studies to solve problems.

Applying Physics in Production

One afternoon, Peng Zhiguang, an old worker from the Chongqing Jiangling Machine Factory, rushed into the workshop excitedly and shouted to the technician: "I found it, I found it!" The technician was puzzled. Master Peng grabbed the technician and walked towards the milling machine. Old Peng picked up an un-milled R-shaped cylinder and said to a milling worker, "Change the coarse-tooth milling cutter to a fine-tooth milling cutter and try milling another one. It's sure to work this time."

The milling machine rattled, and the teeth of the fine-tooth milling cutter pressed tightly against the cylinder. Everyone's eyes were focused on the tip of the cutter. With a "whoosh," the milling cutter completed the final step of milling the groove. The technician quickly took a ruler and measured the groove, and it was exactly 0.02 centimeters. When the workers heard that the key to milling the cylinder's groove had been solved by Old Peng, they all gathered around to ask him how he did it. Old Peng calmly told everyone that he had used the principle of vibration of objects in physics. Then, he expertly introduced the principle and how it was used to solve the key to milling the cylinder's groove.

A few years ago, Master Peng was still semi-illiterate. Since he persisted in amateur cultural studies, his cultural level has continuously improved, and he has continuously solved practical problems in production by applying the principles of science and technology, which has greatly increased his enthusiasm for learning. In addition to attending the school run by the factory, Master Peng also formed a study group with several young workers, including Xia Chengyin and Huang Xiantao. He taught the young men technical skills, and the young men taught him culture. He studied diligently: getting up an hour early in the morning to read in the fields; returning home at night and burying himself in books until late at night; not relaxing his studies whenever he had free time; and often running to a quiet hillside on Sundays, using his knees as a desk to do homework all day.

That's how hard he studied, finishing elementary school in one year, junior high school in two years, and now he has successfully entered the second grade of secondary technical school.

Very Few Defective Products Now

One incident caused the old fitter, Luo Shuming, great pain. The Chongqing Jiangling Machine Factory produced more than twenty drilling machines, and he was responsible for processing a key part—the cam. Because he lacked culture, couldn't calculate, and couldn't read drawings, all of them were scrapped.

When the factory started its first literacy class, he resolutely signed up to participate. In the beginning, because he was older and had a poor memory, he would ask his wife, Liao Xinghui, who was more educated than him, for help when he got home. One day, Old Luo couldn't understand the meaning of "The Foolish Old Man Removes the Mountains" and asked his wife again and again, making Liao Xinghui impatient and saying, "Why are you so stupid? 'The Foolish Old Man Removes the Mountains' means that you must have perseverance and ambition, and then you will definitely succeed." Luo Shuming was inspired. He thought: If I also have perseverance and ambition like the Foolish Old Man, I will definitely learn well.

From then on, he studied tenaciously. He cut out the difficult formulas and problems in arithmetic, algebra, geometry, and chemistry and pasted them on the wall by his bed, reading them several times before going to bed and after getting up every day. When learning geometry and chemistry, he needed to memorize foreign language symbols, so he made these words into letter blocks and put them in his pocket, taking them out to read at any time. It was through such diligent study that Luo Shuming went from being semi-illiterate at the beginning of the Liberation to one of the most educated old workers in the factory. When teaching his apprentices production techniques, he could not only teach them how to do it, but also teach them why they should do it that way. In production, he not only rarely produced defective products, but also sometimes took the initiative to correct errors on the drawings. (Attached picture)

    老工人猛攻文化堡垒
    分秒必争
    深夜二点多钟了，何学信还披着大衣，坐在床上学习。他为什么这样刻苦学习呢？
    何学信是江陵机器厂工具车间的党支部书记。一天晚上，他和车间管理干部在研究工作总结后，感到自己在总结中，没有分析清楚那些是主要经验。自己顶不满意自己，他想如不加紧学习，怎能领导好上千人的车间啊！从此便下了狠心努力学习文化。从1954年坚持学习文化以来，真是五年如一日，每天夜里全村的灯光早已灭尽了，他还在埋头苦学。
    何学信在学习上和做工作一样，总是分秒必争。例如他去看电影，在电影放映前后的几分几秒，也抓紧时间看代数公式和例题。甚至于看一篇文件、听一个报告，他也当作语文来读。
    何学信原来是个贫苦的农民，1951年当工厂领导把他从老检验工提拔到总务科当科长的时候，看不懂文件，也不知如何批，连句子也写不通。但他没有在困难面前低头，虽然是四十岁的人了，还和二十多岁的小伙子订教学合同，做小伙子的“小学生”。现在，何学信已经提高到初中水平了。
    何学信的文化水平和理论水平提高以后，他的领导水平也大大提高了。现在，他做的报告、写的文件，有条有理，很受工人们的欢迎。他领导的工具车间的职工教育工作，也算是全厂做得最好的。他不仅关心车间的生产，也抽时间亲自去督促和帮助学习上有困难的工人解决疑难问题。
    生产中运用物理学
    一天下午，重庆江陵机器厂老工人彭志光兴冲冲地跨进车间，向技术员喊道：“找着了，找着了！”技术员莫名其妙。彭师傅紧拉着技术员，向铣车旁边走去。老彭随手拿起一个未铣槽的R型圆柱体，向一位铣工说：“把粗齿铣刀换成细齿铣刀，再试铣一个，这回准行了。”
    铣车轧轧地响着，细齿铣刀的刀齿紧紧贴着圆柱体。人们的眼光都集中在刀尖上了，“哗”的一声，铣刀完成了最后一步铣槽工作，技术员连忙拿量尺在槽上一量，不多不少，刚刚零点零二糎。工人们一听说圆柱体的铣槽关键被老彭解决了，都纷纷围拢来，问彭师傅怎么解决的。彭师傅不慌不忙地告诉大家说，他是用物理学中物体振动的原理解决的。接着，他很内行地给大家介绍了这个原理和运用这个原理解决圆柱体的铣槽关键。
    几年前，彭师傅还是个半文盲，自从坚持业余文化学习以来，文化程度不断提高，运用学习科学技术原理不断解决生产中的实际问题，因而学习的积极性越来越大。彭师傅除了参加厂里办的学校学习外，还和夏承胤、黄先涛等几个青年工人组成了一个学习组。他教青年们学技术，小伙子教他学文化。他勤奋地学习着：清晨早起一个小时，到田野上去读书；夜晚，一回到家，就捧着书，直学到深夜；平常一有空也不放松学习；星期日，他常常跑到静寂的山坡上，用膝盖当桌子，做一天的习题。
    他就是这样刻苦的学习，一年读完高小，两年读完初中，现在，已经顺利地进入了中专二年级。
    很少出废品了
    有一件事情使老钳工罗树明非常痛心。重庆江陵机器厂生产二十多部钻眼机，他负责加工一个主要零件——曲线轮。因为缺少文化，不会计算，不识图，结果全部报废。
    当工厂办起第一个扫盲班的时候，他坚决报名参加了学习。刚开始学习的时候，因为年纪大些，记忆力差，他回来就向比他文化高的妻子廖兴惠请教。有一天，老罗对“愚公移山”的意思弄不通，问了妻子一遍又一遍，弄得廖兴惠不耐烦地说：“你这个人怎么这样笨”，“‘愚公移山’的意思就是说要有恒心，有志气，事情就一定能做得成功。”罗树明受到了启发。他想：如果我也像愚公那样有恒心，有志气，一定能学习得好。
    从此，他顽强地学习着。把算术、代数、几何、化学等课程中难学的公式和问题，剪下来贴在床头的墙壁上，每天睡觉前、起床后都读它几遍。学几何、化学等，要记外国字的符号，他就把这些字制成字块，揣在口袋里，随时拿出来读。罗树明就是这样勤学苦练地由解放初期的半文盲，变成这个厂的老工人中文化程度最高的人之一了。他教学徒们学起生产技术来，也能够不只是教给他们如何做，而且还能教给他们为什么要这样做了。在生产的时候，他不仅很少出过废品，而且有时还主动修正图纸上的错误了。（附图片）
