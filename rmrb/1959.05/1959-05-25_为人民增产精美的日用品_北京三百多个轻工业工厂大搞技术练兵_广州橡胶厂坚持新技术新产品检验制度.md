To supply the people with more, better, and cheaper light industrial products, Beijing's light industry sector has launched a production increase and economy drive focused on "improving quality and practicing strict economy" throughout the city for over a month.

In the first quarter of this year, the output value of the 136 planned products of Beijing's light industry increased by 90% compared with the same period last year, and labor productivity increased by more than 20%. However, many factories also had the idea of "radishes are harvested fast, so don't bother washing the mud off," thinking that even if the quality is a little worse, people will still buy it. Coupled with the lack of a complete set of technical regulations and management systems, the improvement of product quality was affected.

More than 300 light industrial factories and enterprises focused on improving product quality during the production increase and economy campaign. They adopted various methods. Many factories mobilized the masses to conduct special contention and debate around improving product quality, carefully analyzed the conditions for improving quality, and established technical management systems to ensure quality. Seven industries, including papermaking, cultural and educational supplies, and general merchandise, also held comparison exhibitions of good and bad quality, and invited customers and shop assistants to visit and solicit opinions with an open mind. This made everyone realize that the main reason for the low quality was insufficient attention in thought, relaxation of product inspection, and failure to discover problems and take measures in time. Since the beginning of the "increase production and economy" campaign, Beijing Battery Factory, due to insufficient supply of secondary and tertiary manganese powder used to make batteries, could only use lower-quality quaternary manganese powder, and the discharge time of each battery produced was only about 300 minutes. In the past, workers thought that the quality of raw materials was not good and could not produce better products. Since the "increase production and economy" campaign began, the factory's party organization mobilized the masses to find ways to explore a set of operating methods for making solid cores and tight windings, improved the raw material formula, and established a series of inspection systems. As a result, high-quality batteries were made with quaternary manganese powder, and the discharge time of each battery quickly increased to 450-500 minutes. In order to quickly improve product quality, many factories also adopted technical training methods to continuously improve the technical level of workers.

Many factory workers who use old materials, waste materials, and substitutes attach particular importance to ensuring product quality. Qinghe Paper Mill, Beijing Heying Paper Mill, and other factories have taken measures such as using river algae instead of rice straw and using indigenous methods to produce pulp in normal pressure cooking pots due to insufficient pulp. When they used these pulps to make paper, phenomena such as high moisture content and many pinholes initially occurred. After repeated research, the quality of the paper was gradually improved. In April, the average pass rate of paper production increased by 40% compared with the first quarter, basically solving the problem of pulp supply in the second quarter. Beijing Knitting and Dyeing Factory conducted special debates and experiments on every innovation in saving caustic soda for printing and dyeing fabrics. Under the premise of ensuring the quality of printed and dyed fabrics, the consumption of alkali per 100 meters of colored fabric was reduced from 982 grams to 800 grams, and 28 tons of caustic soda can be saved by the end of the year.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, May 24th. Guangzhou Rubber Factory has insisted on the system that all new technologies, new formulas and new products must be tested. In the past two and a half years, all product quality has been up to standard, of which first-class products account for more than 90%, and no defective products have been produced.

The rubber factory has more than 300 employees and mainly produces rubber ball shoes. The production workshops are scattered, the equipment is relatively old, and there is a lack of inspection instruments. In order to ensure the quality of products, the factory constantly improves technology and insists on the method of testing everything, and strictly implements the delivery inspection system. For example, during the Great Leap Forward last year, in order to increase production, some employees proposed shortening the operation of mixing rubber from the original 18 minutes to 12 minutes. The factory leadership decided to conduct experiments first, convened a meeting of veteran technicians to study measures, and jointly trial-produced samples. After the samples were successfully trial-produced and passed the inspection of the Guangzhou Industrial Output Inspection Institute, the factory leadership officially announced the revision of the original operating procedures. At the beginning of this year, when the factory was trial-producing the new product of layered micro-empty long ball shoes, several sample inspections reached the standards of second-class or third-class products. Some people thought it was good enough and were eager to formally produce it; however, the factory leaders and the majority of employees still insisted on continuing the experiment until they overcame various shortcomings and made the product's various quality indicators meet the requirements of first-class products before deciding to formally put it into production.

This year, the quality of raw materials is not fixed and changes a lot, so the formula and operation methods need to be constantly revised. The factory still patiently insists on the testing system. In April, due to the hard texture of the raw rubber, the previously stipulated rubber rolling operation of continuously rolling 13 times was no longer suitable. After the factory director, technicians, and workers studied together and conducted many experiments, it was finally determined that increasing it to 15 times was the most appropriate, and the rubber rolling operators were notified to strictly abide by it. In addition, they also stipulated that every 2,500 pairs of rubber shoes produced must be sent to the Industrial Products Inspection Institute for inspection, so as to find problems and take measures to improve. Therefore, the quality of the factory's products has been able to remain stable since this year. From late April to mid-May, all 44 batches of rubber shoes delivered to the commercial sector were qualified products.

    为人民增产精美的日用品
    北京三百多个轻工业工厂大搞技术练兵
    广州橡胶厂坚持新技术新产品检验制度
    本报讯　北京轻工业部门为了供应人民群众更多、更好、更便宜的轻工业品，一个多月来在全市范围内掀起一个以“提高质量，厉行节约”为中心的增产节约运动。
    今年第一季度，北京轻工业列入计划的一百三十六种产品和去年同期比较，产值增加了90％，劳动生产率提高20％以上。但是，也有许多工厂有“萝卜快了不洗泥”，质量差一点也有人要的思想，加上缺乏一套完整的技术规程和管理制度，影响了产品质量的提高。
    三百多个轻工业工厂职工在增产节约运动中猛攻产品质量。他们采用了多种多样的方法。许多工厂发动群众围绕着提高产品质量，展开专题鸣放辩论，细致地分析了提高质量的条件，并且建立保证质量的技术管理制度。造纸、文教、日用百货等七个行业还举办了质量好坏对比展览会，并且邀请顾客和商店的售货员参观，虚心征求意见。这样，使大家都认识到：质量不高的主要原因是思想上不够重视，放松了产品检查，没有及时发现问题，及时采取措施。北京电池厂从第一季度开始，由于用来做电池的二、三级锰粉供应不足，只能全部使用质量较差的四级锰粉，生产出来的每节电池放电时间只能达到三百分钟左右。以往职工们都认为原材料质量不好，不能生产出较好的产品。自从“增产节约”运动开始以后，这个厂党组织发动群众想办法，摸索出一套电芯打得实、缠线缠得紧的操作方法，改进了原料配方，建立了一系列检验制度。结果，用四级锰粉做出了优质电池，每节电池的放电时间迅速提高到四百五十——五百分钟。为了迅速提高产品质量，许多工厂还采取了技术练兵的方式，来不断提高工人的技术水平。
    许多使用旧料、废料、代用品的工厂职工，特别重视保证产品质量。清河造纸厂、北京合营造纸厂等九个工厂在纸浆不足的情况下，采取了用河澡代替稻草、土法常压蒸煮锅制造纸浆等措施。他们在使用这些纸浆造纸时，开始曾发生水分大、砂眼多等现象，经过反复研究后，纸的质量步步提高，4月份产纸平均合格率比第一季度提高40％，基本上解决了第二季度纸浆供应的问题。北京市机织印染厂在节约印染色布用的烧碱时，项项革新都经过专题辩论和试验。在保证印染色布质量的前提下，使印染每百公尺色布的耗碱量由九百八十二克下降到八百克，到年底可以节约烧碱二十八吨。
    本报广州24日电　广州橡胶厂由于坚持一切新技术、新配方和新产品必须经过试验的制度，近两年半来产品质量全部合格，其中一等品占90％以上，没有出过废品。
    橡胶厂是一个有三百多名职工，主要生产胶球鞋的工厂，生产车间分散，设备比较陈旧，也缺乏检验仪器。为了保证产品的质量，这个工厂一面不断改进技术，一面坚持一切经过试验的办法，并严格执行送检制度。如在去年大跃进中，为了提高产量，有些职工提出了将混炼胶的操作由原来十八分钟缩短到十二分钟的意见。工厂的领导就决定先作试验，召开了老技工会议研究措施，并共同试制样品。样品试制成功后，经广州工业产量检验所检验合格，工厂的领导才正式宣布修改原来的操作规程。今年初，这个工厂在试制新产品分层微空长球鞋时，开始几次样品检验达到了二等品或三等品的标准，有人便认为不错了，急于要正式生产；但工厂领导和大多数职工仍坚持继续进行试验，直到克服了各种缺点，使产品各项质量指标都达到一等品的要求后，才决定正式投入生产。
    在今年原材料质量不固定、变化多，因而需要不断修正配方和操作方法的情况下，这个工厂还是耐心坚持试验的制度。4月份，由于原料胶的质地较硬，以前规定的滚胶操作为连续辘滚十三次已经不相适应，经厂长、技术人员和工人一起研究和多次试验后，最后确定以增加到辘滚十五次为最适宜，并通知滚胶操作的工人严格遵守。此外，他们还规定了每生产二千五百双胶鞋，就必须把样品送去工业产品检验所检验，从中发现问题，采取措施改进。因而今年以来这个工厂产品的质量仍能保持稳定。从4月下旬到5月中交给商业部门的四十四批胶鞋产品，全部为合格品。
