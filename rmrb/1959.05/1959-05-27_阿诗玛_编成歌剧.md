"Ashima" Adapted into an Opera

(Our Dispatch) The famous narrative poem "Ashima" (originally named Poor Ashima) of the Sani ethnic group in Guishan, Yunnan, has been adapted into an opera by Sani farmers and brought to the stage. This poem reflects the struggle of the Sani people against the exploiting classes through the love story of Ashima and Asai. The opera adopts the most popular tunes of the ethnic group to express the emotions of the characters in various specific situations in the play. It also uses the musical instruments of the ethnic group, adding a strong ethnic flavor. This opera has been well received at the Yunnan Provincial Art Program Performance Conference.

The poem "Ashima" was originally a poem that was widely circulated orally among the Sani people for a long time. In August 1950, Yang Fang translated a fragment of it, which was published in the September issue of "Poetry and Prose" of the same year. The Beijing Opera Troupe of the Yunnan Military Region once adapted "Ashima" into a Beijing Opera performance. The Yunnan Provincial People's Literary and Art Work Troupe dispatched a working group composed of some comrades to Guishan District, Lunan Yi Autonomous County, to carry out the excavation and arrangement work of "Ashima". In December 1954, "Ashima" was published by China Youth Publishing House.

    “阿诗玛”编成歌剧
    本报讯  云南圭山撒尼族著名叙事长诗“阿诗玛”（原名可怜的阿诗玛）经撒尼族农民编成歌剧搬上舞台。这首诗是通过阿诗玛和阿萨的爱情故事，反映出撒尼族人民与剥削阶级的斗争。这个歌剧采用了本民族流行最广的调子，来表现剧中各个特定情景中的人物情绪。又采用了本民族的乐器，增加了浓厚的民族气息。这个歌剧在云南省艺术节目会演大会上得到了好评。
    “阿诗玛”这首诗原是撒尼族人民口头上长期广泛流传的诗篇。1950年8月间，曾由杨放译出过片段，登载在同年9月号的“诗歌与散文”上。云南军区京剧团曾将“阿诗玛”改编成京剧演出。云南省人民文艺工作团曾抽调部分同志组成一个工作组，到路南彝族自治县圭山区进行了“阿诗玛”的发掘和整理工作。1954年12月，“阿诗玛”由中国青年出版社出版。
