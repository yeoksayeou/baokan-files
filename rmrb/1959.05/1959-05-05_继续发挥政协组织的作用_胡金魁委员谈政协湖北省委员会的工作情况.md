Chairman, fellow committee members:

    I fully endorse Premier Zhou Enlai's government work report and Vice Chairman Li Weihan's work report of the CPPCC Standing Committee, as well as the various reports of other central leading comrades. These reports summarize the experiences of our country's work in various fields, especially the experiences of the Great Leap Forward in 1958. At the same time, the reports point out the tasks for the future, which are of great enlightenment and encouragement to us. We should all conscientiously implement these instructions in our respective work positions.

    Now, I would like to express some personal opinions on the issue of continuing to give play to the role of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference organization and serving the cause of socialist construction. If they are appropriate, please correct them, fellow committee members.

    As Vice Chairman Li Weihan pointed out in his report, in recent years, the CPPCC and its local committees, "under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, in the struggle against enemies at home and abroad, in the socialist revolution movements on the economic, political, and ideological fronts, in the cause of socialist construction, in implementing the Chinese Communist Party's policy of 'long-term coexistence and mutual supervision' with the democratic parties, and in helping democratic figures from all walks of life to carry out self-reform, have done a lot of work" and "played an important role." We must have a correct assessment of the role of the CPPCC that is in line with the actual situation. It is wrong to exaggerate its role, and it is also wrong to diminish and underestimate its role. On this issue, not everyone has clearly understood it now. Aren't there people who are skeptical about the role of the CPPCC or even say that the CPPCC has no role? We must carry out serious explanatory work on this incorrect understanding, eliminate this harmful tendency, and enable the due role of our Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference to continue to be brought into play. Experience has proven that the role of the CPPCC is multifaceted. It plays the role of unity, the role of personnel arrangement, the role of mutual supervision, the role of coordinating relations, and the role of self-education and self-reform within the people, and so on. And these roles are indispensable in our country's political life. Lacking these roles will be detrimental to the unity of our people and our socialist construction cause. It must also be pointed out that with the vigorous development and great achievements of our country's socialist revolution and socialist construction cause, our people's political and spiritual outlook has undergone great changes, and unity has been further enhanced. However, we must never think that the unity of our people, including the unity of the working people and the non-working people, can be given insufficient attention. We must know that there is still the threat of imperialism abroad, our Taiwan is yet to be liberated, and the bourgeoisie, as a class, still exists and still has the task of uniting and transforming them. The CPPCC is precisely the organization that plays the role of unity and self-reform. Therefore, we cannot think that our socialist construction cause has developed and the CPPCC organization is dispensable. On the contrary, in order to consolidate the great unity of our people and to promote the continued development of the socialist construction cause, it is necessary to continue to give play to the role of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference organization.

    The Hubei Provincial Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, under the direct leadership of the Hubei Provincial Committee of the CPC and the guidance of the National Committee of the CPPCC, has done a lot of work in recent years, like all other localities across the country, and has achieved great results in its work, playing a good role in uniting democratic figures from all walks of life in the province and mobilizing all positive factors to serve socialist construction. Our work mainly involves promoting local organizations of democratic parties and non-party democratic figures to invest themselves in the cause of socialist revolution and socialist construction, namely, to invest themselves in "transformation" and "service." With the development of the national political situation, we have conducted consultations on major issues in the country and the province at various times through various forms. After fully exchanging opinions, we have unified our understanding and assisted the Communist Party and the People's Government in smoothly implementing various policies and guidelines. At the same time, in accordance with the regulations of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and the Standing Committee of the CPPCC at various periods, we have organized CPPCC members to inspect industrial and agricultural production. Through various inspections, on the one hand, we have provided many constructive opinions and suggestions; on the other hand, we have also improved the understanding of the members. In helping democratic figures from all walks of life to carry out self-education and self-reform, we have also done a lot of work, organized regular political theory studies, and established political schools, which have provided 372 democratic figures from various counties and cities with a relatively concentrated and in-depth learning opportunity. In addition, various counties and cities have also held a large number of political training classes, widely absorbing bourgeois elements to study. When the bourgeois rightists launched a frenzied attack on the Party, we united the broad leftists and middle elements to carry out a resolute anti-rightist struggle. After the victory of the anti-rightist struggle, when the broad middle elements urgently demanded to transform themselves, we organized and promoted rectification and heart-to-heart talks among democratic figures from all walks of life, formulated collective plans for carrying out fundamental self-reform, launched friendly challenges to the province and other parts of the country, and helped them regularly check the implementation of the transformation plans. In addition, we have also helped democratic figures from all walks of life to participate in labor training through various forms, especially organizing democratic figures to participate in labor training to produce iron and steel on a large scale, which not only produced steel, but more importantly, trained people. All of this is carried out around strengthening transformation and striving to serve. Experience has proven that "transformation" and "service" are complementary and mutually promoting. Without a certain degree of self-transformation, it is impossible to make better contributions; it is also useless to talk about transformation without practical business and social practice. We should correctly combine the two. Transformation is for better serving the cause of socialism, and at the same time, strengthening self-transformation in the process of service, and gradually resolving the contradictions between the two roads and the two methods. At present, we cannot think that the transformation of bourgeois elements and bourgeois intellectuals is almost complete, nor can we expect to complete the transformation task at once based on our subjective wishes. We must remember Premier Zhou's instructions in his report that "it is wrong to think that old intellectuals no longer need to carry out self-transformation, or to think that they must complete thorough transformation in a very short period of time, otherwise they cannot do their work."

    Speaking of promoting democratic figures from all walks of life to serve the cause of socialist construction, there is still some work to be done at present. There is no doubt that after the rectification movement (including heart-to-heart talks) and the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production in 1958, most of the bourgeois elements and bourgeois intellectuals took a big step forward in politics towards the left, and their work enthusiasm was greatly improved. However, at the same time, some people feel that there are certain difficulties in their work, and they are tied up, afraid of making mistakes, which inevitably leads to insufficient enthusiasm and affects their work. We have done some work on this situation in the past, and we will continue to do so in the future, so that we can work together to do our common cause well.

### 继续发挥政协组织的作用  胡金魁委员谈政协湖北省委员会的工作情况

    继续发挥政协组织的作用
    胡金魁委员谈政协湖北省委员会的工作情况主席、各位委员：
    我完全拥护周恩来总理所作的政府工作报告和李维汉副主席所作的政协常务委员会工作报告以及其他各位中央领导同志的各项报告，这些报告总结了我们国家各个方面工作的经验，特别是总结了一九五八年大跃进的经验。同时在报告中指明了今后的任务，这对于我们有着巨大的启发和鼓舞，我们大家应该在各自的工作岗位上认真地贯彻执行这些指示。
    我现在就继续发挥中国人民政治协商会议组织的作用、为社会主义建设事业服务的问题，发表一点个人意见，是否妥当，请到会委员指正。
    正如李维汉副主席在报告中所指出的，几年来，政协及其各地方委员会，“在中国共产党的领导下，在反对国内外敌人的斗争中，在经济战线、政治战线和思想战线上的社会主义革命运动中，在社会主义建设事业中，在贯彻执行中国共产党同各民主党派‘长期共存、互相监督’的方针和帮助各界民主人士进行自我改造中，做了许多工作”，“发挥了重要的作用”。对于政协的作用，我们必须有一个符合实际情况的正确的估计，夸大它的作用是不对的，缩小和低估它的作用，也是不对的，在这个问题上，现在并不是所有的人都已经认识清楚了，现在不是有人对政协的作用持怀疑态度甚至说政协没有什么作用吗？对于这种不正确的认识，我们必须进行认真的解释工作，消除这种有害的倾向，使我们的人民政治协商会议的应有作用，得到继续发挥。经验证明，人民政协的作用是多方面的，它起着团结的作用，安排人事的作用，互相监督的作用，协调关系的作用，以及在人民内部进行自我教育和自我改造的作用，等等。而这些作用，在我们国家的政治生活中是不可缺少的，缺少这些作用，就会有损于我国人民的团结和我们的社会主义建设事业。还必须指出，随着我国的社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业的蓬勃开展和巨大成就，我国人民的政治面貌和精神面貌有了很大的变化，团结更加增强了，但决不能认为我国人民的团结包括劳动人民同非劳动人民的团结就可以不给予充分的重视了。要知道，国外还有帝国主义的威胁，我国的台湾尚待解放，资产阶级作为一个阶级来讲，仍然存在，仍然有团结他们和改造他们的任务，而政协正是发挥团结和自我改造作用的组织，因而不能认为我们的社会主义建设事业发展了，政协这个组织就可有可无了，正相反，为了巩固我国人民的大团结，为了促进社会主义建设事业的继续发展，需要继续发挥中国人民政治协商会议组织的作用。
    中国人民政治协商会议湖北省委员会，在中共湖北省委的直接领导下和政协全国委员会的指导下，同全国各个地方一样，几年来作了不少工作，在工作上取得了很大的成绩，对于团结全省各界民主人士，调动一切积极因素为社会主义建设服务，起了良好的作用。我们的工作，主要是推动各民主党派地方组织和无党派民主人士投入到社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业中去，即投入到“改造”和“服务”中去。随着国家政治形势的发展，我们通过各种形式，就各个时期全国范围和全省范围内的重大问题，进行了协商，经过充分交换意见，统一了认识，并协助共产党和人民政府顺利地贯彻了各项政策方针。同时按照人大常委和政协常委各个时期的规定，组织政协委员视察了工农业生产，通过各次视察，一方面提供了不少建设性的意见和建议；另方面，也提高了委员们的认识。在帮助各界民主人士进行自我教育和自我改造方面，我们也做了很多工作，组织了经常性的政治理论学习，开办了政治学校，已经使各县市的民主人士三百七十二人得到了一次较集中和深入的学习机会，此外，各县市还举办了大量的政治讲习班，广泛吸收资产阶级分子进行学习。当资产阶级右派向党猖狂进攻的时候，我们团结广大左派和中间分子进行了坚决的反右派斗争，在反右派斗争取得胜利以后，广大中间分子迫切要求改造自己的时候，我们组织和推动了各界民主人士的整风和交心运动，制订了进行根本自我改造的集体规划，向全省和全国各地发动了友谊挑战，并帮助他们定期检查改造规划的执行情况。此外，还通过各种形式，帮助各界民主人士参加了劳动锻炼，特别是组织民主人士大办钢铁的劳动锻炼，不仅炼出钢，重要的是炼了人。所有这一切，都是围绕着加强改造与努力服务这两个方面进行的。经验证明，“改造”与“服务”两者是相辅相成、互相促进的，没有一定程度的自我改造，不可能有较好的贡献；脱离业务实践与社会实践，空谈改造也是没有用的。我们应该把两者正确地结合起来。改造是为了更好地为社会主义事业服务，同时在服务的过程中加强自我改造，逐步解决两条道路、两种方法的矛盾。当前，我们既不能认为资产阶级分子和资产阶级知识分子的改造已经差不多了，也不能凭我们主观愿望企求一下子把改造任务完成，我们要记着周总理在报告中指示的，“以为旧知识分子已经不需要再进行自我改造，或者以为他们必须在很短的时间内完成彻底的改造，否则就不能做工作，都是不对的”。
    谈到推动各界民主人士为社会主义建设事业服务这一点，目前还有一些工作要做。不用怀疑，经过整风运动（包括交心运动）和一九五八年工农业生产大跃进，资产阶级分子和资产阶级知识分子中的大多数人在政治上向左转化了一大步，他们的工作积极性大为提高，但同时还有一些人感到工作中有一定困难，表现束手束脚，怕犯错误，这样就必然干劲不足，影响工作。对于这种情况，我们过去作了一定的工作，在今后我们还将继续进行工作，以便同心协力，把我们的共同事业作好。
