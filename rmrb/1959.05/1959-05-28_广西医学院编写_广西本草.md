Guangxi Medical College Compiles "Guangxi Materia Medica"

    (Our dispatch) The first collection of "Guangxi Materia Medica," compiled by students of Guangxi Medical College, was completed on "May Day." This collection includes 200 kinds of Chinese herbal medicines from Guangxi, with detailed information on the name, scientific name, other names, origin, morphology, growth environment, medicinal part, properties, indications, prescriptions, dosage, usage, and contraindications of each herbal medicine, along with botanical illustrations.
      "Guangxi Materia Medica" is the result of teachers and students of Guangxi Medical College going to the countryside to visit teachers and seek wisdom, collect prescriptions, and gather herbs from November of last year to January of this year. They collected more than 1,000 kinds of Chinese herbal medicine specimens and tens of thousands of folk secret recipes and effective prescriptions. Under the direct leadership of the Party Committee of the college, students formed the Materia Medica Compilation Group to compile "Guangxi Materia Medica." The entire collection will introduce more than 1,000 kinds of medicines and will be published in four volumes. The students participating in the compilation used more than three months of their spare time to scientifically identify the family and scientific names of the medicines and, with the help of some traditional Chinese medicine practitioners, completed the work of supplementing and collating information on the medicinal parts. The students of the college are now rushing to compile the second collection, preparing to complete it before "July 1st."

    广西医学院编写“广西本草”
    本报讯  广西医学院学生编写的“广西本草”，第一集的编写工作已于“五一”完成。这一集的内容包括广西的中草药二百种，其中对各种中草药植物名称、学名、别名、产地、形态、生长环境、药用部分、性味、主治、处方、用量、用法、禁忌等均有详细的资料介绍，并附有植物绘图。
      “广西本草”，是广西医学院师生在去年11月至今年1月下放农村访师拜贤，采方采药得来的成果。他们共采集了中草药药物标本一千多种，收集了民间秘方、验方几万条。在该院党委的直接领导下，由该院学生组成本草编写小组编写“广西本草”，全集计介绍一千多种药物，共分四集出版。参加编写工作的学生利用三个多月的课余时间，对药物的科名、学名进行了科学鉴别，并在一些中医师的帮助下完成了药用部分的补充资料整理工作。现在该院学生正赶编第二集，准备在“七一”以前完稿。
