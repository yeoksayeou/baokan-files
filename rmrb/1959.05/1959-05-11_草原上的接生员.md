    Midwife on the Grassland
    At the quiet riverbank at dawn, the crisp sound of horseshoes rang out. In the clear river water, the reflection of a horse-riding girl was seen, urging her whip and galloping.
    She wore a calico cotton-padded jacket, carried a Red Cross medical kit, and regardless of how her two black braids swung vigorously on her shoulders and back, she sped swiftly across the grassland.
    Now, her horse was making its way through a village composed of tents scattered like stars.
    From behind a yurt, a ferocious lion-like mastiff would occasionally dart out, baring its teeth and barking madly at the approaching person. But as the rider approached, it would wag its tail, showing unusual friendliness. It turned out that the rider was not a stranger to the grassland!
    In front of a tent, the owner greeted the rider with extremely anxious eyes. The horse-riding girl jumped off her horse and followed the owner, lifting the felt door and entering the tent.
    After about two hours, people heard a baby's loud cry from the tent...
    The tent owner, who had not had children for many years, couldn't help but dance with joy. The anxious look on his face was completely dispelled by the joy in his heart. He looked affectionately at the newborn baby and murmured, "Chairman Mao's balangzi, Chairman Mao's balangzi!" (Note)
    The clinic's girl followed the customs of the Kazakh people and extended warm congratulations to the mother and the male owner of the tent. The owner also expressed his deep gratitude to the girl with the best wishes.
    When the sun rose to midday, the girl walked out of the tent, declined the hospitable owner's earnest invitation to stay, mounted her horse, and galloped away again. She remembered that another family had a pregnant woman whose delivery date was also approaching, and she had to hurry to visit her.
    The sun shone brightly on the beautiful grassland, which was covered with flocks of sheep, cattle, and horses. Seeing that the grassland livestock was abundant, the population was thriving, and it was prospering day by day, the girl on horseback felt as if a flower was blooming in her heart. She raised her whip high, and the horse let loose its hooves, running even faster across the grassland in a straight line...
    Note: Balangzi, Kazakh for child.

    草原上的接生员
    黎明的静静的河边，响起了清脆的马蹄声。在清澈的河水里，映现着一个骑马的女郎，正在扬鞭飞奔。
    她身穿一件花布棉袄，挎着一个红十字药包，不管两条乌黑的辫子，在肩背上怎样使劲地摆动，迅猛地在草原上奔驰着。
    现在，她的马驹穿行在一片星罗棋布的帐篷组成的村落里。
    不时，会从一家毡房背后，窜出来一条凶狠的狮子大黄狗，呲牙咧嘴地向来人狂吠着。但等到骑马的人走到跟前，它却摇摇尾巴，表现出异常亲热的样子。原来，马上的骑者，并不是草原上的生客啊！
    在一家帐篷门前，主人用无比焦灼的眼神，迎接着骑者。骑马的女郎倏地跳下了马背，随着主人，撩起毡门，走进帐篷。
    大约两个时辰的光景，人们听到帐篷里传出了婴儿响亮的哭声……。
    多年没有得到儿女的帐篷主人，不禁喜得手舞足蹈。刚才那副焦灼的神情，完全被满心的欢喜驱散了。他深情地望着新生的婴儿，喃喃地说：“毛主席的巴郎子，毛主席的巴郎子！”（注）
    卫生所的姑娘遵循哈萨克人民的习俗，向产妇和帐篷的男主人，致了热情的祝贺。主人也用最好的祝愿，表达了对姑娘深深的谢忱。
    当太阳升到中天的时候，姑娘从帐篷里走出来，辞谢了好客的主人的殷切挽留，跨上马背，又奔驰起来。她想起，另一户人家有一个产妇临产期也近了，她要赶着去探望她。
    阳光普照着美丽的草原，草原上布满了羊群、牛群和马群。马上的女郎眼见这草原牲畜如云、人丁兴旺、一天天繁盛起来，心上好像有朵花儿也在盛开了。只见她把鞭子高高地举起，那马便放开蹄子，首尾一条线地在草原上跑得更猛了……。
    注：巴郎子，哈萨克语，小孩的意思。
