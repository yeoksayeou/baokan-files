　　TASS Denies:
    No Soviet-British Negotiations on Iraqi Oil Issue; Cairo Newspaper's Slanderous Tactics are Despicable
    Xinhua News Agency, May 9th: TASS Moscow, May 8th:

　　In recent months, rumors concerning the foreign policy of the Soviet government have been published in newspapers of the United Arab Republic. In particular, the Cairo newspaper "Al-Gomhuria" reported on May 3rd and 4th, insisting that Britain and the Soviet Union had held secret negotiations in Moscow, and reached an agreement on the Iraqi oil issue as a result of the negotiations.
    TASS is authorized to declare that the claims of "Al-Gomhuria" are complete lies. They can only demonstrate the political baseness of the publishers of this newspaper.

    苏英并未谈判伊石油问题  开罗报纸的造谣手段卑鄙
    新华社9日讯　塔斯社莫斯科8日电：
　　最近几个月，在阿拉伯联合共和国的报纸上刊登了一些关于苏联政府外交政策的谣言。特别是，5月3日和5月4日开罗“共和国报”报道，硬说英国和苏联曾在莫斯科举行秘密谈判，谈判结果就伊拉克石油问题达成协议。
    塔斯社受权就此声明，“共和国报”的说法是彻头彻尾的谎言。它们只能表明这家报纸的出版者在政治上的卑鄙手段。
