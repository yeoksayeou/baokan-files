Xinhua News Agency, May 20th: The Bulgarian Modern Fine Arts Exhibition opened this morning at the Wenhua Hall of the Forbidden City in Beijing. Hundreds of prominent Chinese artists and foreign envoys to China attended the opening ceremony and visited the exhibition.

The exhibition features more than 210 of Bulgaria's finest modern oil paintings, sculptures, and prints, all of which were recently displayed at the "Fine Arts Exhibition of Socialist Countries" held in Moscow. All the exhibits comprehensively reflect the revolutionary struggles of the Bulgarian people from resisting barbaric Turkish rule to opposing fascist aggression, and also reflect the moving scenes of the socialist construction period.

The exhibition is jointly organized by the Chinese People's Association for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries and the Sino-Bulgarian Friendship Association, according to the 1959 executive plan of the Sino-Bulgarian Cultural Cooperation Agreement. Qu Wu, Vice-Chairman of the Commission for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries, presided over today's opening ceremony and delivered the opening speech.

Bulgarian Ambassador to China, Panchevski, briefly introduced the development of modern Bulgarian fine arts at the opening ceremony.
