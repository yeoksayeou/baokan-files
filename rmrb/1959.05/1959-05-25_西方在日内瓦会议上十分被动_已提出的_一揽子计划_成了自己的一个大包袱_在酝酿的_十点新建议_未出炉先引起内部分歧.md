Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, May 23rd (Reporter Peng Di) reports: The so-called "package plan" for solving the German problem proposed by Western countries is not only a stumbling block to the Foreign Ministers' Conference, preventing progress in the discussion of substantive issues, but also makes it difficult for Western countries to move forward, putting them in a very passive position. Many signs in Geneva indicate that this "package plan" is indeed a heavy burden, tightly tied around the necks of Western countries themselves.

This heavy burden encompasses all the outstanding issues between East and West in Europe, from the unification of Germany to complete disarmament, and links the issues together. Touching any one issue affects the whole, with the central content being the annexation of the German Democratic Republic by West Germany according to the American method, and the central purpose being to obstruct any agreement at the conference.

During the second week of the Foreign Ministers' Conference, representatives from the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic thoroughly refuted this "package plan" from various angles.

After this week's debate within the conference, everyone has seen the correctness of the Soviet Union's proposals regarding the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany and the end of the occupation regime in West Berlin, and has seen the positive and active attitude of the Soviet representative inside and outside the conference. Now the whole world is watching when the Western countries will dismantle their "package plan" and sit down with the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic to discuss specific issues related to the peace treaty and West Berlin.

The Western countries are still stubbornly defending the integrity of their "package plan," especially since the US representative, when initially proposing the plan at the conference, boasted that it was an indivisible whole, essentially tying a noose around their own necks. However, on the other hand, under the illumination of the Soviet Union's correct policies and the pressure of world public opinion, it is becoming increasingly difficult for Western countries to maintain the integrity of this "package plan," which was pieced together by various Western countries and has inherent deficiencies. Even the main architect of the plan, the United States itself, is gradually realizing that continuing this farce is not very beneficial for Western countries. An official from the US delegation privately spread the word to reporters on the 18th that if the West cannot reach a broader agreement with the Soviet Union, the West will negotiate a temporary solution to the Berlin issue. This incident caused a storm, with the West German and French delegations greatly angered, complaining about this undermining action. In the midst of the chaos, the Western delegations held an emergency meeting and then hurriedly issued a statement denying that the West had such intentions.

Denials aside, Britain, which publicly expressed support for the Western "package plan" under US pressure, repeatedly leaked Western temporary plans for resolving the West Berlin issue through some small British conservative newspapers, such as the "Daily Mail." Many diplomatic reporters here believe that this is a deliberate attempt by the British side to test the waters. Although Britain does not really want to solve the problem, according to sources close to the West German delegation, these actions by Britain have greatly angered West German and French officials, who have angrily denounced Britain as a "traitor." At the same time, American reporters such as David Lawrence are also writing articles in American newspapers, saying that Britain is an unreliable fellow.

Many signs indicate that while the Western countries do not want to solve the problem and are reluctant to abandon their "package plan," they also see that this "package plan," which is unpopular externally and contains various conflicts of interest internally, will sooner or later be abandoned and sent to the historical archives museum. Therefore, Western countries have to prepare for the aftermath of this "package plan."

British representative Lloyd, while always supporting the US at the conference and opposing the conclusion of a peace treaty before German unification, also stated that Western countries could consider proposing some general principles regarding the peace treaty now. A few days ago, Western countries indeed came up with a ten-point proposal regarding a peace treaty with Germany. These proposals did not change the West's stubborn position of unifying Germany first, but these ten points did not mention certain contents of the "package plan," such as complete disarmament. Major British and American newspapers such as the London "Times" and the "New York Times" have published these ten points. A spokesman for the US delegation also confirmed at a press conference that Western countries are considering these proposals, but so far, Western countries have not formally put forward this proposal at the Foreign Ministers' Conference.

According to well-informed Western sources in Geneva, Western countries may have originally planned to put forward these ten points at this week's Foreign Ministers' Conference to counter the Soviet peace proposals and perfunctorily deal with public opinion. However, even such a tactical step has been opposed by hardliners in Western countries. Indeed, if these ten points are formally proposed at the conference, it would mean the formal disintegration of the Western "package plan." The French representative, acting as the "spokesman" for West Germany, opposed formally proposing these ten points, arguing that since the US representative had already said that there is no unified Germany to be the object of a peace treaty, wouldn't the West be contradicting itself if it further proposed proposals related to the peace treaty?

The facts of the past two weeks show that the "package plan" proposed by the West themselves was originally intended to cope with the Soviet proposals, but the result was that the Western foreign ministers tied their own hands and feet, mutually restraining each other, unable to move, and adopting an attitude of being perpetually passive. On the contrary, the Soviet Union's struggle inside and outside the conference was very active and flexible, so that the Western countries, who were strongly opposed to discussing the Soviet draft peace treaty, had to repeatedly discuss the draft peace treaty at the conference, and were even forced to consider putting forward their own so-called peace treaty proposals.

The facts of the past two weeks have also proved that the Western countries' "package plan" is vulnerable and cannot withstand a few days of discussion, with flaws appearing everywhere. The so-called Western "unity" firmly standing behind the "package plan" has also begun to crack, a point that even the US "New York Times" had to acknowledge on May 20th.

While the Western countries are in a very passive and contradictory situation, US Secretary of Defense McElroy, representing US arms dealers and US warmongering generals, rushed to Geneva to join the US delegation. Observers in Geneva believe that McElroy's role at the Foreign Ministers' Conference is to try to obstruct any agreement at the conference, delay the collapse of the Western plan, and strengthen control over Western allies. It is reported that the US delegation has already instructed certain American reporters on the evening of the 22nd to emphasize toughness towards the Soviet Union in their reports and commentaries. On the same day, at the meeting of experts from the Soviet Union, Britain, and the United States on not continuing nuclear weapons testing, the attitude of the US representative was also more恶劣 than before. These are all events that occurred after McElroy arrived in Geneva. People in Geneva are watching to see how much influence this arriving US general will have on the Western diplomats who will continue to sit at the conference table next week.

### 西方在日内瓦会议上十分被动  已提出的“一揽子计划”成了自己的一个大包袱  在酝酿的“十点新建议”未出炉先引起内部分歧

    西方在日内瓦会议上十分被动
    已提出的“一揽子计划”成了自己的一个大包袱
    在酝酿的“十点新建议”未出炉先引起内部分歧
    新华社日内瓦23日电　本社记者彭迪报道：西方国家提出的所谓解决德国问题的“一揽子计划”，不但是外长会议的绊脚石，使得会议在实质问题的讨论上无法取得进展，而且使得西方国家自己也寸步难移，十分被动。在日内瓦出现的许多迹像都说明，这个“一揽子计划”的确是一个大包袱，死死地拴在西方国家自己的脖子上。
    这个大包袱，集东西方在欧洲悬而未决的问题之大成，从统一德国到全面裁军，而且将问题一个串连一个，触动任何一个就牵动全体，其中心内容就是要按美国的办法，用西德来并吞德意志民主共和国，中心目的就是要阻挠会议达成任何协议。
    在第二周的外长会议上，苏联和德意志民主共和国的代表，从各个角度，就这个“一揽子计划”进行了透彻的批驳。
    经过这星期以来的会内辩论，大家都看到了苏联关于缔结对德和约和结束西柏林占领制度等主张的正确，并且看到苏联代表在会内会外的积极主动态度。现在全世界都在看着西方国家什么时候拆散他们那个“大包袱方案”，坐下来同苏联和德意志民主共和国商谈有关和约和西柏林等具体问题。
    西方国家还在硬着头皮为他们的“一揽子计划”的完整性而辩护，特别是美国代表最初在会上提出这个计划时已经夸下海口说，这是一个决不可分割的整体，也就是说自己给自己扣上了一个死结。但是，另一方面，在苏联的正确政策的照明和世界舆论的压力下，西方国家要维持这个由西方各国七拼八凑、先天不足的“一揽子计划”的完整性是越来越困难了。甚至这个计划的主要制造者美国自己也逐渐感到这样胡闹下去，对西方国家并不太妙。美国代表团的一个官员18日私下就给记者散布空气说，如果西方不能同苏联达成较为广泛的协议，西方将就柏林问题协商一个临时性的解决办法。这件事引起了一场风波，西德和法国代表团为此大为震怒，埋怨这种给自己拆台的行动。在一片混乱中，西方国家代表团召开了紧急会议，随后匆匆忙忙发表了一个声明，否认西方有这种意图。
    否认尽管否认，在美国压力下公开表示支持西方“一揽子计划”的英国，却接二连三地通过一些英国保守党的小报，如“每日邮报”等透露出西方关于解决西柏林问题的临时计划。这里的许多外交记者都认为，这是英国方面有意放出来的试探触角。尽管英国也并不真想解决问题，但据接近西德代表团的人士说，英国的这类行动已经使得西德和法国人士十分恼怒，破口大骂英国是“叛徒”。同时，美国记者们如戴维·劳伦斯等也在美国报上大写文章，说英国是个靠不住的家伙。
    许多迹象说明，西方国家一方面不想解决问题，舍不得扔掉他们的“大包袱”计划，可是同时，他们也看到这个对外不得人心、对内又包含着各种利益冲突的“大包袱”计划迟早会被唾弃，送进历史档案博物馆去。因此，西方国家也不得不在为这个“一揽子计划”准备后事。
    英国代表劳埃德在会上一方面时时不忘为美国帮腔，反对在德国统一前缔结和约，但同时他又表示，西方国家可以考虑现在就提出一些有关和约的一般性原则。前两天，西方国家果然弄出了一个有关对德缔和的十点建议。这些建议并没有改变西方要首先统一德国的顽固立场，但是这个十点建议却没有提到“一揽子计划”中某些内容，如全面裁军等。英美一些大报如伦敦“泰晤士报”、“纽约时报”都刊登了这个十点建议。美国代表团发言人在记者招待会上也证实了西方国家正在考虑这些建议，可是到现在为止，西方国家并没有在外长会议上正式提出这个建议。
    据日内瓦消息灵通的西方人士说，西方国家原来可能在本周的外长会议上提出这个十点建议，用来同苏联的和平建议对抗和敷衍社会舆论。可是尽管是这样一个策略性的步骤，也受到西方国家中的死硬派的反对。的确，如果这个十点建议一旦在会上被正式提出，它将意味着西方“一揽子计划”的正式解体。充当西德“代言人”的法国代表反对正式提出这个十点建议，他的理由是：既然美国代表已经说过现在没有一个统一的德国可以作为签订和约的对象，那末西方如进一步提出有关和约的建议，不就是自己打自己的嘴巴了吗？
    两周来的事实表明，西方自己提出来的“一揽子计划”原来是想用来应付苏联的建议的，其结果却是把西方外长们自己的手脚都捆住了，互相牵制，动弹不得，摆着一副永远被动挨打的架势。相反地，苏联在会内会外的斗争，十分主动灵活，使得极力反对讨论苏联提出的和约草案的西方国家不得不在会上反复讨论和约草案，甚至也被迫要考虑提出自己的所谓和约建议来。
    两周来的事实还证明，西方国家的“一揽子计划”不堪一击，经不起几天讨论，就处处出现破绽。所谓坚决站在“一揽子计划”后面的西方“团结”也开始出现裂痕，这一点连5月20日的美国“纽约时报”也不得不予以承认。
    正在西方国家处境十分被动矛盾的时候，代表美国军火商和美国好战将军们的美国国防部长麦克耳罗伊匆匆赶到了日内瓦，参加美国代表团。日内瓦的观察家认为，麦克耳罗伊在外长会议上充当的角色是要极力阻挠会议达成协议，延缓西方计划的崩溃和加强对西方盟国的控制。据悉，美国代表团已经在22日晚上授意美国某些记者，要他们的报道和评论强调对苏联强硬。同一天，在苏、英、美三国专家举行的不继续试验核武器会议上，美国代表的态度也比以前更加恶劣。这些都是麦克耳罗伊到达日内瓦以后出现的事件。日内瓦的人们都在注视着，这位翩然莅临的美国将军将对下周继续坐在会议圆桌边的西方外交家们起多大的影响。
