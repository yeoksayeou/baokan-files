    Going to the Front Lines
    Li Xu
    Last December, I went to Xuchang, Henan, and happened to be there when the comrades from the Ministry of Agriculture, who had been sent down to the countryside for labor training, were about to return to Beijing. The county was preparing to bid them farewell. I interviewed these comrades and also visited the production teams where they had participated in labor. When these comrades talked about the gains they had made from their labor training, they almost all said in unison: "A few months in the countryside are better than a few years in the office." They excitedly spoke of the education and help they received from the masses, the care they received in their lives, ... and now that they were about to leave this dear "home" and say goodbye to these people they had lived with day and night, they felt reluctant to part. Some were even moved to tears as they spoke.
    When the local masses and cadres talked about these comrades, they couldn't help but feel excited, saying that these comrades were good cadres of the Party, good sons and daughters of the masses, and that they had given the masses so much help in production and culture. They praised their hard-working and simple style and their sharing of weal and woe with the masses. Especially the old men and women, when they talked about the comrades who lived in their homes, always called them "daughters" and "sons" and couldn't stop praising their good deeds. I personally witnessed the scene of the masses bidding farewell to the comrades sent down, and the warmth, intimacy, and reluctance to part were truly touching. As the train started, the crowd of people seeing them off on the platform were reluctant to leave for a long time, waving to the train that was gradually moving away.
    Several months have passed, and this vivid scene still appears clearly before my eyes. I deeply realize the wisdom and correctness of the decision to send cadres down to the countryside for labor training. It strengthened the connection between cadres and the masses, increased the strength of building a new socialist countryside, and also tempered and transformed the cadres themselves. The reason why our country's Great Leap Forward achieved tremendous results last year was also inseparable from the close connection of the comrades sent down with the masses and their guidance in production.
    The comrades who were sent down for labor training last year have returned, and another group of comrades has gone down this year. And this year's sending down has some characteristics compared to last year, and it is a further step forward than last year. This year's sending down includes not only general cadres, but also many responsible comrades from provincial, prefectural, and county Party committees and industrial and mining Party committees. They took the lead in going to the communes for labor, going to the grassroots to work, going to the front lines, participating in production, and leading production. This is a great encouragement to the working people of the whole country. This is the development and promotion of the Party's mass line, and it is a concrete manifestation of a more thorough leadership style.
    Cadres, especially leading cadres, are sent down to the countryside to become ordinary commune members; sent down to factories to become ordinary workers, eating, living, and working with the masses. Also, generals are sent down to companies to be soldiers. In this way, the relationship between cadres and the masses becomes closer, so that they can understand each other and be of one heart and one mind. Some situations that were not easily heard in the past are heard, some things that were not easily seen in the past are seen, and it is easier to understand what ideas and requirements the masses have. It is also easier to discover problems in production and work, and it is more convenient to discuss and solve them together with the masses. It is also possible to discover and promote good experiences in production and work in a timely manner. This is of great benefit to improving and strengthening leadership work. At the same time, because cadres participate in production and have practical production knowledge and experience, they are more specific, meticulous, and realistic in leading production work or other work. This truly achieves "from the masses, to the masses" and can better and more easily implement the Party's policies and guidelines.
    According to reports, many responsible comrades from provincial, prefectural, and county Party committees went to the front lines some time ago to participate in production and guide production. In addition to working in the fields with the commune members, they also held discussions with commune members, grassroots cadres, and commune cadres. In this way, many new problems can be discovered and solved in a timely manner, and many experiences have been promoted in a timely manner. This is a new leadership method and a new leadership style. It is a new thing that has emerged since cadres were sent down for labor training. It is very valuable and worthy of promotion.
    This year is a year of continued Great Leap Forward, and the second quarter is the most tense time for production. We must mobilize all forces and launch a production upsurge. Responsible comrades from provinces and counties should use more or even all of their time to go to the front lines to command, supervise, lead, and help the masses, and work together with one heart and one mind to strive for the completion of the magnificent production targets.
    Cadres closely contact the masses, and the masses wholeheartedly trust and love cadres. Cadres and the masses, leaders and the led, are twisted into one rope and become one. This is the fundamental key to the success of any of our undertakings.

    开上第一线
    李旭
    去年12月，我到河南许昌去过一次，正碰上农业部下放到那里劳动锻炼的同志要回北京，县里正准备欢送他们。我访问过这些同志，也到他们参加过劳动的生产队里去访问过。这些同志谈到他们劳动锻炼的收获时，几乎是异口同声地说：“下乡几个月，胜坐机关几年”，他们激动地谈到群众对他们的教育、帮助，对他们生活上的关怀，……而现在就要离开这个亲爱的“家”，和这些朝夕相处的亲人告别，总觉依依难舍，有的说着竟泫然泪下。
    当地群众和干部谈到这些同志时，也忍不住心里的激动，说这些同志是党的好干部，是群众的好儿女，说他们在生产上、文化上给了群众多么大的帮助，对他们那种艰苦朴素与群众同甘苦的作风赞扬备至。尤其是那些老大爷、老大娘，一谈到住在自己家里的下放同志时，总是“闺女”“儿子”地叫个不休，对他们的好处夸个不完。我亲眼看到群众欢送下放同志的场面，那种热烈、亲切和依依难舍的情景，真使人感动万分。火车开动了，站台上欢送的人群，还久久不肯离去，向渐渐远去的火车招着手。
    几个月已经过去了，这生动的场面还清晰地出现在我的眼前。我深切地体会到干部下放劳动锻炼政策的决定的英明正确，它加强了干部与群众的联系，增加了建设社会主义新农村的力量，同时也锻炼和改造了干部自己。去年我国生产大跃进之所以取得巨大成绩，也是和下放同志的紧密联系群众，指导生产分不开的。
    去年下放劳动锻炼的同志回来了，今年另一批同志又下去了。而今年的下放，比去年又有些特点，比去年更进了一步，今年下放的除一般干部外，还有许多省、地、县委和工矿党委的负责同志，他们带头到公社劳动，到基层工作，开上第一线，参加生产，领导生产。这对全国劳动人民是一个莫大的鼓舞，这是党的群众路线的发扬光大，是领导作风更加深入的具体表现。
    干部，尤其是领导干部，下放到农村中，成为一个普通的公社社员；下放到工厂中，成为一个普通的工人，与群众同吃、同住、同劳动。还有，将军们下放到连队去当兵。这样，干部和群众的关系就更密切了，就能做到彼此了解，心心相印。一些过去不容易听到的情况听到了，一些过去不容易看到的事情看到了，群众有些什么想法，有些什么要求，也都更容易了解，生产和工作中有些什么问题，也都更容易发现，更便于和群众商量一起解决，生产和工作中有些什么好的经验，也能及时发现和推广。这对于改进和加强领导工作，是有很大好处的。同时，由于干部参加了生产，有了实际生产的知识和经验，在领导生产工作或其他工作上，也就更加具体、细致和切合实际了，这就真正做到了“从群众中来，到群众中去”，就能更正确和比较容易地贯彻党的政策方针。
    报载，许多省委和地委、县委的负责同志，前些时候亲临前线，参加生产，指导生产，他们除了和社员一道到田里劳动外，还分别与社员、基层干部和公社干部举行座谈。这样，许多新问题就能够及时发现，加以解决，许多经验都得到了及时推广。这是新的领导方法和新的领导作风，是干部下放劳动锻炼以来出现的新事物，非常可贵，是值得提倡的。
    今年是继续大跃进的一年，第二季度又是生产最紧张的时候，必须调动一切力量，掀起生产高潮。省的和县的负责同志们，应当用更多的以至全部的时间，到前线去指挥督战、领导和帮助群众，万众一心为完成宏伟的生产指标而奋战不懈。
    干部密切地联系群众，群众衷心地信任和爱戴干部。干部和群众，领导和被领导拧成一条绳，打成一片，这是我们任何事业能够取得胜利的根本关键。
