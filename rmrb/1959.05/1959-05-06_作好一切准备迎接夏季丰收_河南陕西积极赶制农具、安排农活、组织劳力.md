Make All Preparations to Greet the Summer Harvest
Henan and Shaanxi Actively Rush to Produce Farm Tools, Arrange Farm Work, and Organize Labor

    *People's Daily*, Zhengzhou, May 5th: In order to welcome an even greater wheat harvest this year, Henan Province is launching a high tide of tool reform centered on reforming summer harvesting tools.

    Currently, in the vast plains of Henan Province, seventy million mu of wheat have generally headed. This year, due to improvements in cultivation techniques such as deep plowing and close planting, the wheat is growing densely and vigorously. In order to ensure a bumper harvest, all parts of Henan Province are making all preparations for the summer harvest. The manufacture and reform of harvesting, threshing, and all small farm tools serving the summer harvest are underway. According to recent incomplete statistics, the province has already reformed and rushed to produce more than six million pieces of various summer harvesting and planting tools.

    In mid-April, the Henan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Henan Provincial People's Committee jointly convened a provincial tool reform conference, which comprehensively studied and deployed the work of rushing to produce and reform summer harvesting and planting tools. At this conference, according to local plans, before the wheat harvest, the province will continue to implement the policy of "obtaining materials locally, producing locally, tapping potential, and relying on our own efforts," to reform and reform various summer harvesting tools by 9,225,000 pieces, summer planting tools by 4,735,000 pieces, and produce 38 million sets of ball bearings, of which 16 million sets will be supplied for summer harvesting tools.

    In the reform of harvesting and threshing tools, the main task is to adapt to local conditions and reform and promote small farm tools in large quantities. Because the wheat is growing densely this year, many small farm tools are no longer suitable and need to be reformed. Also, because the summer harvest time is short, the task is heavy, and the amount of labor invested is large, the number of small farm tools required is very large. According to this year's harvesting tasks, small farm tools are generally lacking in some areas. Therefore, before the wheat harvest, in addition to organizing specialized forces to repair the original small farm tools in large quantities, the province plans to produce five million sickles, one million shovels, and promote 600,000 to 800,000 scythes, and also organize the production of stone rollers, mulberry forks, brooms, and whetstones in large quantities. Xinxiang Prefecture will universally promote the scythe that has been out of use for many years. With this scythe, two people can harvest 15 to 20 mu of wheat a day.

    Reforming the canteen tools is an important method of tapping the potential of summer harvest labor. According to incomplete statistics from 75 counties (cities) in seven prefectures (cities) across the province, by the end of March, more than 60,000 canteens had achieved semi-mechanization of cooking utensils, and more than 300,000 cooks and flour millers had been drawn out and put into the agricultural front. Therefore, the province plans to promote various improved mills, vegetable cutting machines, and self-flowing water for drinking in large quantities before the wheat harvest, and strive to draw out more labor to invest in the summer harvest.

    *People's Daily*, Xi'an, May 5th: The Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Shaanxi Provincial People's Committee recently issued instructions on preparing for the summer harvest. It requires party committees at all levels to be headed by the secretary, make unified arrangements, and do a good job in preparing for the summer harvest in all aspects. Half a month before the start of the summer harvest, the work must be arranged properly, the labor force must be organized properly, the tools must be repaired properly, the livestock must be fed properly, and the technology must be trained properly.

    Shaanxi Province has a total of 23 million mu of wheat and 7 million mu of summer miscellaneous grains this year. After the continuous hard work of the vast number of farmers, they are generally growing well, and a greater harvest than last year is promising. Because these wheat plants are densely packed and tall, the amount of harvesting work will be doubled compared to last year. For this reason, the instructions require party committees and people's committees at all levels to pay attention to the preparatory work for the summer harvest ideologically while doing a good job in the later field management; and require all counties, communes, and production teams to quickly establish summer harvest headquarters and strive for every grain to be returned to the barn.

    The instructions said that rationally arranging labor is the central link to ensure the smooth progress of the summer harvest. People's commune organizations at all levels must organize all possible labor forces to ensure that more than 90% of the labor force is invested in the summer harvest during the busy season. When arranging work, we should strive to do all the work that can be done in advance before the summer harvest. All localities should also cooperate and support each other between early-harvest areas and late-harvest areas, between counties and counties, between communes and communes, and within communes, in accordance with the principle of equal exchange. All organs, schools, troops, and urban residents should actively help farmers rush to harvest.

    The instructions require all localities to immediately launch an agricultural tool reform movement centered on manufacturing and improving summer harvesting tools. All people's communes should immediately conduct an inspection of the summer harvest and then formulate a supplementary plan to organize local iron and carpenters and agricultural tool factories to manufacture according to quality, quantity, and time limit. It is also required that the commercial departments in various places supply small tools such as brooms, fork handles, dustpans, pockets, and whetstones used for the summer harvest to the production teams before the summer harvest.

    *People's Daily*, Xi'an, May 5th: Various parts of Shaanxi Province have begun to manufacture various improved summer harvesting agricultural tools. The Xi'an Agricultural Machinery Manufacturing Factory will rush to produce 500 horse-drawn harvesters recently. The factory recently successfully trial-produced an automatic feeding threshing machine and is preparing to produce it in batches. Agricultural tool factories in various places have successively begun to produce large quantities of sickles. Many commune agricultural tool manufacturing or repair factories are rushing to manufacture and repair various agricultural tools for harvesting, transportation, and threshing. Some communes along the northern foot of the Qinling Mountains have also sent commune members to the mountains to cut down the materials needed for making brooms and wooden forks.

### 作好一切准备迎接夏季丰收  河南陕西积极赶制农具、安排农活、组织劳力

　　作好一切准备迎接夏季丰收
    河南陕西积极赶制农具、安排农活、组织劳力
    本报郑州5日电　为了迎接今年的小麦更大丰收，河南省掀起以改制夏收工具为中心的工具改革运动高潮。
    目前，在河南省的千里平原上，七千万亩小麦已普遍抽穗。今年由于深翻、密植等耕作技术的改进，小麦生长得茂密而又茁壮。为了保证丰产丰收，河南省各地正在为夏收做好一切准备，收割、脱粒及一切为夏收服务的小件农具制造和改革工作正在进行。据最近的不完全统计，全省已改革、赶制各种夏收夏种工具六百多万件。
    中共河南省委、省人民委员会在4月中旬联合召开了全省工具改革会议，全面研究和布置了夏收夏种工具的赶制和改革工作。在这次会议上，根据各地规划，麦收以前，全省要继续贯彻执行“就地取材，就地生产，挖掘潜力，自力更生”的方针，改制、改革各种夏收工具九百二十二万五千件，夏种工具四百七十三万五千件，生产滚珠轴承三千八百万套，其中供应夏收工具用的一千六百万套。
    在收割、脱粒工具的改制工作中，主要是因地制宜大量改制和推广小件农具。因为今年小麦生长茂密，有许多小件农具已不合用，需要进行改制，也因为夏收时间短，任务大，投入的劳力多，需要的小件农具数量很大。根据今年收割任务，一般地区小件农具都要缺少一部份。因此在麦收前，全省除组织专门力量大量修补原有小件农具外，计划生产镰刀五百万件，铲子一百万件，推广钐刀六十到八十万个，并且要大量改良石磙、组织桑杈、扫帚和磨刀石的生产。新乡专区要普遍推广已停止使用多年的钐刀，用这种钐刀两人一天能收割小麦十五到二十亩。
    作好食堂工具的改革，是挖掘夏收劳动潜力的一个重要方法。据全省七个专区（市）的七十五个县（市）不完全统计，到3月底止，已有六万多个食堂实现了炊具半机械化，抽出了三十多万个炊事、磨面人员投入农业战线。因此，全省计划在麦收前大量推广各式改良磨，切菜机和吃水自流化，争取抽出更多劳力投入夏收。　（方徨）
    本报西安5日电　中共陕西省委和陕西省人民委员会不久前发出做好夏收准备工作的指示。要求各级党委必须由书记挂帅，统一安排，从各方面做好夏收准备工作。在夏收开始的半个月以前，切实把活路安排好，劳动力组织好，工具添修好，牲口喂养好，技术训练好。
    陕西省今年共有二千三百万亩小麦和七百万亩夏杂粮，经过广大农民群众的连续奋战，普遍生长良好，比去年更大的丰收大有希望。由于这些小麦生长密度大，长得高，收割的工作量将比去年成倍地增加。为此，指示要求各级党委和人民委员会在做好田间后期管理的同时，从思想上重视夏收的准备工作；并要求各县、社、生产队迅速地建立起夏收指挥部，争取颗粒归仓。
    指示说，合理地安排劳力，是保证夏收顺利进行的中心环节。人民公社各级组织必须把一切可能调动的劳力全部组织起来，保证大忙期有90％以上的劳力投入夏收。在安排活路的时候，应当把一切可以提前的工作，力争在夏收前做好。各地还应当根据等价交换的原则，在早收地区与迟收地区之间，县与县、公社与公社之间以及公社内部，互相进行协作支援。各机关、学校、部队和城镇居民，都要积极帮助农民抢收。
    指示中要求各地立即开展一次以制造、改良夏收工具为中心的农具改革运动。各人民公社应立即对夏收具体进行一次检查，然后订出增补计划，组织当地铁木匠和农具厂，定质定量，限期制造。还要求各地商业部门在夏收前将夏收用的扫帚、杈把、簸箕、口袋、磨刀石等小工具供应到生产队。
    本报西安5日电　陕西省各地已开始制造各种改良夏收农具。西安农业机械制造厂将在最近赶制五百部马拉收割机。这个厂最近试制成功自动喂入式脱谷机，正准备成批生产。各地农具厂相继开始生产大批镰刀。不少公社农具制造或修理厂，都正在赶制和修理各种收割、运输、脱粒用的农具。沿终南山北麓的公社，有的还派社员上山，砍伐作扫帚、木杈所需用的材料。
