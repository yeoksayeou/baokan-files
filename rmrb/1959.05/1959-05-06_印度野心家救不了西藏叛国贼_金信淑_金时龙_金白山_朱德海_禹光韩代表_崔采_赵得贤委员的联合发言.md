Indian Adventurers Can't Save Tibetan Traitors
    Joint Statement by Jin Xinshu, Jin Shilong, Jin Baishan, Zhu Dehai, Representative Yu Guanghan, Cui Cai, and Committee Member Zhao Dexian

    Chairman, esteemed delegates, esteemed committee members:

    We fully agree with Premier Zhou Enlai's Government Work Report, and the reports of Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen.

    We, the Korean people residing in the Northeast, under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, have been forever freed from the deep suffering of the past and have achieved tremendous progress and development. The areas where Koreans live in concentrated communities have implemented national regional autonomy, exercising the right to manage the internal affairs of our own nationality. The Korean people living in scattered areas also fully enjoy the rights of national equality and have victoriously completed democratic reforms and socialist transformation. At the same time, through the rectification movement centered on opposing local nationalism, the political and ideological consciousness of the Korean people has been greatly enhanced, clearly drawing a line between the two distinctly different paths of socialism and capitalism, nationalism, resolutely supporting the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and safeguarding the unification of the motherland, and further strengthening the unity among all ethnic groups with the Han people as the core. The enthusiasm for jointly building socialism is unprecedentedly high. Under the brilliant illumination of the Party's General Line, after the Great Leap Forward of 1958, we have achieved leap-forward development on all fronts, including the economic and cultural fronts. Taking the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture in Jilin Province as an example, in the industrial sector, a steel industry has been newly established, ending the history of the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture never producing steel. Local industry throughout the prefecture has flourished everywhere. In the past year, more than 7,000 large, medium, and small factories and mines have been established, and the number of employees has almost doubled. In the mass technological revolution movement, great miracles have been created, and more than 200 new products such as motors and transformers have been successfully trial-produced. These achievements have pushed the industrial production of the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture to a new stage of development. In agriculture, an unprecedented bumper harvest was also achieved. Last year, the total output of grain crops (including soybeans) reached more than one billion jin, an increase of more than 60 percent compared with 1957. From October 1957 to September 1958, the newly added irrigated area reached more than 50,000 mu, which is 15 percent more than the irrigated area increased in the past eight years. Other sectors such as transportation, culture, education, and health have also been developed accordingly. The development of education is particularly prominent. The number of students in the four colleges and universities in the prefecture increased by 54 percent compared with 1957. Junior middle school education has been basically popularized, and the task of eliminating illiteracy has been completed, forming a situation of cultural popularization.

    The achievements mentioned above are not only a great victory for the Party's General Line of socialist construction, but also indicate that the Party's ethnic policy has blossomed splendidly and borne fruitful results among the Korean people in the Northeast. All these have made us deeply feel the warmth and happiness of living in the great family of the motherland, and realize that the unity of the motherland is the highest interest of the people of all nationalities in the country. Only by closely uniting in the great family of the motherland can ethnic minorities prosper and become strong. Facts fully prove that this has become an irrefutable truth. However, the former Tibetan local government and the upper-class reactionary clique, recently harboring ulterior motives, recognizing thieves as fathers, under the instigation of British imperialists and Indian expansionists, openly betrayed the motherland, launched an armed rebellion, and conspired to split Tibet from the great family of the motherland and place it under foreign protection. When the armed rebellion was quickly quelled, and the conspiracy of the British imperialists and Indian expansionists who had long planned and supported this rebellion was shattered, they revealed their true colors, became embarrassed and angry, and rampantly slandered the Chinese people in lengthy articles. Some leading figures of the ruling party and officials in India even clamored to hold meetings, shouting that India could not stand by and watch our country quell the Tibetan rebellion, stirring up trouble everywhere, making wild remarks, and engaging in activities that poisoned Sino-Indian friendship and interfered in China's internal affairs. The chairman of the Congress Party openly described our Tibet as a "country," and the general secretary of the Congress Party described the Tibetan rebellion as a "just cause." They have exhausted their ability to reverse black and white and make malicious attacks. Their purpose is nothing more than to inherit the true teachings of British imperialism, which is nothing more than denying China's sovereignty over Tibet. They stubbornly oppose the concepts of Tibetans and Chinese, and the secret they cannot tell is that they vainly attempt to split Tibet from the Chinese family and make it a colony and protectorate of India. The Indian expansionists are truly in line with the Chinese saying "A snake tries to swallow an elephant, but never gets enough." The Tibetan region has always been an inseparable part of Chinese territory. This is an ironclad historical fact that is recognized by the whole world and cannot be overthrown by anyone. Indian interventionists and some of their politicians, vainly attempting to forge history, fabricate lies, and reverse right and wrong, cannot cover up their ugly faces, but can only more clearly expose their wolfish ambition to interfere in our internal affairs, invade our territory, and enslave our Tibetan compatriots. We sternly warn these dizzy politicians that the era when the Chinese people were allowed to be enslaved and slaughtered is gone forever. Any conspiracy to dare to invade our Tibet will inevitably suffer a shameful failure. Your ambition and conspiracy to split Tibet from our great motherland can never be realized.

    We Chinese people have always cherished the friendship with the Indian people. In order not to allow imperialism to take the opportunity to provoke discord, and also to wait for those Indian political figures to calm down and stop their words and deeds that are hostile to the Chinese people, we have repeatedly restrained ourselves. However, they actually regarded our country's patient maintenance of friendly relations between China and India as weak and deceitful, openly supporting and sympathizing with Tibetan armed rebels. We absolutely cannot tolerate this behavior of rudely interfering in our internal affairs.

    In the recent series of shameless slanders made by certain politicians and newspapers in India against us, they have consistently denied the fact that the Dalai Lama was abducted, and vigorously promoted the so-called "Dalai Lama's statement" distributed by Indian officials, using it as a weapon to launch vicious attacks against us. However, lies can never obliterate facts, and slander can never withstand verification. The truth will eventually come out. Now the truth has come to light. In addition to the existing witnesses and material evidence, even Indian political leaders have to admit that the Dalai Lama did write several letters to Tan Guansan, the acting representative of the Central Government in Tibet. This confirms that the Dalai Lama was abducted. The chain reaction caused by this is a series of loud slaps in the face to the Indian expansionists, that is: the upper-class reactionary clique in Tibet launched an armed rebellion against the will of the people and also against the will of the Dalai Lama. The so-called statements were imposed on the Dalai Lama by people with ulterior motives. In this way, the ugly faces of Indian expansionists that cannot be seen are fully exposed. We, the Korean people in Northeast China, together with the people of all ethnic groups in the country, seriously warn the imperialists and Indian adventurers not to think of undermining the unity of our motherland and the solidarity of all ethnic groups. You should put away your wolfish ambitions, quickly rein in your horses at the edge of the cliff, and do not mistake the patience of the Chinese people for weakness and deception. Your handful of Indian adventurers cannot save a handful of Tibetan traitors. If you are still obsessed and persist in your wrongdoings, risking the condemnation of the world, you will bear all the consequences arising therefrom.

　　印度野心家救不了西藏叛国贼
    金信淑　金时龙　金白山  朱德海　禹光韩代表  崔采　赵得贤委员的联合发言主席、各位代表、各位委员：
    我们完全同意周恩来总理的政府工作报告，李富春、李先念副总理和彭真副委员长的报告。
    我们居住在东北的朝鲜族人民，在中国共产党和毛泽东主席的正确领导下，永远摆脱了过去历史上的深重灾难，获得了巨大的进步和发展。朝鲜族聚居的地区已经实行了民族区域自治，行使了管理本民族内部事务的权利，在散居地区的朝鲜族人民，也充分地享受了民族平等权利，并胜利地完成了民主改革和社会主义改造。同时，经过了以反对地方民族主义为中心的整风运动，朝鲜族人民的政治思想觉悟大大提高，明确地划清了社会主义和资本主义、民族主义两条截然不同的道路的界限，坚决地拥护中国共产党的领导和维护祖国的统一，更进一步地增强了以汉族人民为核心的各民族之间的团结，共同建设社会主义的积极性空前高涨，在党的总路线的光辉照耀下，经过一九五八年的大跃进，在经济、文化各条战线上，都获得了飞跃的发展。如以吉林省延边朝鲜族自治州为例，在工业方面，新建立了钢铁工业，结束了延边朝鲜族自治州从来不产钢铁的历史；全州地方工业出现了遍地开花、星罗棋布的局面。一年来，兴办了大、中、小型厂矿七千多个，职工人数增加将近一倍。在群众性的技术革命运动中，大创奇迹，试制成功了电动机、变压器等二百多种新产品。这些成就，把延边朝鲜族自治州的工业生产推上了一个新的发展阶段。农业方面也获得了空前的大丰收，去年粮食作物总产量（包括大豆）达十多亿斤，比一九五七年增产百分之六十以上。从一九五七年十月到一九五八年九月，新增加的灌溉面积达五万多亩，比过去八年中间增加的灌溉面积还多百分之十五。其他如交通运输、文教卫生事业也得到了相应的发展。其中教育事业的发展比较突出，全州四所大专学校的学生比一九五七年增加百分之五十四，基本上普及了初中教育，完成了扫盲任务，形成了文化大普及的局面。
    以上这些成绩的获得，不仅是党的社会主义建设总路线的伟大胜利，也标明了党的民族政策已在东北朝鲜族人民中开出了灿烂之花，结下了丰硕之果。所有这些，都使我们深深地体会到生活在祖国大家庭中的温暖和幸福，认识到祖国的统一是全国各民族人民的最高利益。少数民族只有紧密团结在祖国大家庭中才能繁荣富强。事实充分地证明，这已成了颠扑不破的真理。但是，原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团，最近竟心怀叵测，认贼作父，在英帝国主义和印度扩张主义分子的指使下，公然背叛祖国，发动武装叛乱，阴谋把西藏从祖国大家庭中分裂出去，置于外国卵翼之下。当武装叛乱被迅速平定，长期策划和支持这个叛乱的英帝国主义者和印度扩张主义分子的阴谋被粉碎之后，他们原形毕露，老羞成怒，大肆嚣张，连篇累牍地发出对中国人民的诬蔑，印度执政党和官方一些领袖人物，竟嚣张到集会叫嚷印度对我国平定西藏叛乱不能旁观，到处煽风点火，大放厥词，进行毒化印中友谊、干涉中国内政的活动，国大党主席公然把我国的西藏说成是“国家”，国大党总书记把西藏叛乱说成是“正义事业”。他们极尽颠倒黑白与恶毒攻击之能事。究其目的，不外是承受了英帝国主义的嫡派真传，无非是否认中国对西藏的主权。硬把西藏人和中国人这两个概念对立起来，骨子里不可告人的秘密却在于妄想使西藏从中国的大家庭中分裂出去，成为印度的殖民地和保护国。印度扩张主义分子，真是应了中国那句
  “人心不足蛇吞象”的俗话了，西藏地方从来就是中国领土不可分割的一部分，这是铁一般的历史事实，是全世界所公认的，谁也推翻不了的。印度干涉主义分子及其某些政治家，妄想伪造历史，捏造谎言，颠倒是非是掩盖不住他们的丑恶嘴脸的，只能更加明显地暴露出阴谋干涉我国内政、侵略我国领土、奴役我们的藏族同胞的狼心狗肺而已。我们正告这些头脑发昏的政治家们，中国人民任人奴役宰割的时代，已经一去不复返了。任何胆敢侵略我国西藏的阴谋，必然遭到可耻的失败。你们想把西藏从我们伟大的祖国中分裂出去的野心阴谋是永远不能实现的。
    我们中国人民一向十分珍贵同印度人民的友谊，为了不使帝国主义乘机挑拨，也为了等待那些印度政界人士能够冷静下来，停止他们与中国人民为敌的言行，我们才再三克制自己。可是他们竟把我国耐心维护中印两国友好关系，看成是软弱可欺，公然支持和同情西藏武装叛乱分子，这种粗暴干涉我国内政的行为，是我们所绝对不能容忍的。
    在最近印度某些政治家和报刊对我们一连串的造谣中伤的无耻谰言中，一直都死死否认达赖喇嘛被劫持这个事实，大肆宣扬经由印度官方散发的所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”，并以之为武器，发动了对我们恶毒的攻击。但是，谎话绝对抹煞不了事实，诬蔑也绝对经不起对证，纸里终久是包不住火的。现在真象已经大白，除了原有人证物证俱在外，就是印度政治领袖也不得不承认达赖喇嘛确实是写了几封信给中央驻藏代理代表谭冠三将军，这也就证实了达赖喇嘛是被劫持的，由此而引起的连锁反应是给了印度扩张主义分子一连串响亮的耳光，那就是：西藏上层反动集团发动武装叛乱是违背了人民，也违背了达赖喇嘛的意志，几个所谓声明，也是别有用心的人强加于达赖喇嘛身上的。这样，就使印度扩张主义分子不可见人的丑恶嘴脸，全部暴露出来了。我们东北朝鲜族人民和全国各族人民一起，严重警告帝国主义和印度野心家，休想破坏我们祖国的统一和各民族的团结。你们应该收起狼子野心，赶快悬崖勒马，不要把中国人民的耐心当作软弱可欺。你们一小撮印度野心家是救不了一小撮西藏叛国贼的。你们如果仍旧执迷不悟，甘冒天下之大不韪，必将承担由此产生的一切后果。
