Weinan, May 14th (Our Dispatch) – Weinan County, Shaanxi Province, organized a large-scale inspection and appraisal involving ten thousand people, setting off a high tide in summer production. Three large production inspection teams, jointly organized by county party secretaries, county heads, and party organization secretaries, chairpersons, directors, and team leaders from various communes, management districts, production teams, and production sub-teams, conducted thorough inspections of late-stage summer field management, cotton and early autumn crop sowing and early management, livestock feeding management, tool reform, summer harvesting and summer planting preparations in all ten communes of the county from April 28th to May 10th, effectively promoting current production. Through this in-depth field inspection and appraisal, the experiences of spring production were summarized and promoted, and eighteen red flags were awarded to advanced production units. Now, a competition to learn from and catch up with the advanced has been launched throughout the county, pushing current production to a higher climax.

The Zhongsu (China-Soviet) Friendship Production Team of the Yuezhen Management District of the Huayin Commune has always had good production, while the Xin Jianbao Production Team was relatively poor. This was the view held by both cadres and the masses. However, the on-site inspection and appraisal revealed that the 242 mu of wheat fields of the Xin Jianbao Production Team (including 70 mu of wheat fields on stubble land that people previously thought were not growing well) were growing almost as well as the high-yield fields of the Zhongsu Friendship Production Team. All cotton seedlings were strip-sown and emerged well. However, the 198 mu of cotton fields of the Zhongsu Friendship Production Team had many missing seedlings due to ditch irrigation. Wheat pest control was also poor. During the inspection and appraisal, the red flag was awarded to the Xin Jianbao Production Team, and the shortcomings of the Zhongsu Friendship Production Team were pointed out. This production team held a mass meeting overnight, examined its complacency, and the next day mobilized 260 people, with 198 people inspecting and replanting 70 mu of cotton fields in one day, and 62 people controlling wheat pests.

The Sanbao Production Team of the Wucun Management District of the Tongguan Commune did well in all aspects of its work during the inspection and appraisal, except for the prevention and control of wheat stripe rust. In order to maintain the red flag, they held a mass meeting on the evening after the inspection and appraisal. The next day, 173 people formed seven specialized rust prevention teams and treated 88 mu in one day. Many production teams, upon hearing that the inspection team was coming, took practical action to vigorously promote production to welcome the inspection team. The Huaiya Production Team of the Chengguan Commune had repaired 114 pushcarts for summer harvesting before the inspection team arrived. After the inspection team left, the enthusiasm for production increased even more.

After the inspection team inspected the Baiyang Management District of the Chengguan Commune on May 3rd, based on the problems found by the inspection team, a telephone conference was held that evening. On the 4th, three cadres were sent to various production teams to lead production. Within one day, 526 mu of wheat were irrigated, 1426 mu of wheat stripe rust were controlled, 426 pieces of farm tools were repaired and modified, 326 mu of cotton fields were replanted, and 3646 cartloads of manure were accumulated.

This inspection and appraisal revealed many common problems in current production, and also found experiences from the masses to solve these problems, which were immediately promoted. During the inspection, it was found that the grain planting area in some places had decreased due to the expansion of the area of cash crops. It was then discovered that the Gushi Commune, under the slogan of "villageside fields turned into gardens, every household planting corn and pumpkins," had planted more than 2200 mu of corn, pumpkins, etc., using the open space in front of and behind houses, and had also planted more than 100 mu of early corn on all land that could be spring-sown. The inspection team immediately promoted the commune's method throughout the county to expand the grain planting area.

During the inspection, it was found that in arranging summer harvesting work, some places, in view of the fact that wheat currently relies mainly on manual harvesting, and that this year's wheat is tall and dense, requiring more labor, adopted the method of arranging labor based on the team, and also mobilizing labor equally under the unified leadership of the management district and the entire commune. The inspection team affirmed and promoted this experience. The inspection also summarized and promoted the experience of some places in preparing fertilizer for cotton fields and summer planting, and launched a shock manure accumulation campaign throughout the county.

Organizing large-scale inspections and appraisals is an important leadership experience that this county has repeatedly proven to be effective during the Great Leap Forward in production. This inspection and appraisal also has the following characteristics: closely combining listening to reports from cadres at each level from the commune to the production sub-team with convening mass meetings and conducting individual interviews; combining cursory inspections with in-depth and detailed inspections of a certain production team; on the one hand, inspecting advanced units, selecting advanced units, awarding prize flags, setting up models, and helping them summarize their experiences for on-site promotion; on the other hand, inspecting backward units, specifically helping to find the causes and propose solutions, while also setting up opposing examples and using examples of good and bad models to educate the vast number of cadres and masses.

    检查促跃进　评比起高潮
    渭南组织田间大检查大评比
    发现问题立即解决　总结经验现场推广
    本报渭南14日电　陕西渭南县组织万人大检查大评比，掀起夏季生产高潮。全县包括县委书记、县长以及各公社、管理区、生产队、生产小队的党组织书记、社长、主任、队长等共同组织的三个大的生产检查团，从4月28日至5月10日，在全县十个公社普遍深入地检查了夏田后期管理、棉花和早秋作物的播种及早期管理、牲畜饲养管理、工具改革、夏收和夏种准备等项工作，有力地推动了当前生产。通过这种深入的田间大检查大评比，总结和推广了春季生产经验，并把十八面红旗奖给先进生产单位，现在全县掀起了学先进赶先进的竞赛，把当前生产推向更高潮。华阴公社岳镇管理区中苏友好生产队历年来生产都很好，新建堡生产队则较差，从干部到群众都有这样看法。实地检查评比中发现，新建堡生产队的二百四十二亩麦田
  （包括过去人们认为长得不好的七十亩谷茬地小麦），都和中苏友好生产队的高产田长的差不多，所有棉苗都是条播，出土很好，但中苏友好生产队的一百九十八亩棉田因开沟溜种，缺苗很多，小麦防虫较差。检查评比中把红旗奖给了新建堡生产队，并指出中苏友好生产队的缺点，这个生产队连夜召开群众大会，检查了骄傲自满情绪，第二天即出动二百六十人，一百九十八人一天给棉花查苗补苗七十亩，六十二人防治小麦虫害。潼关公社吴村管理区三堡生产队，检查评比中各项工作都好，只是防治小麦条锈病较差。他们为了保持红旗，检查评比后的当晚召开群众大会，次日由一百七十三人组成七个防锈专业队，一天防治了八十八亩。很多生产队，听到检查团要去检查，都以大搞生产的实际行动来迎接检查团。城关公社槐衙生产队，在检查团去前，修理好夏收用的一百一十四辆架子车。检查团走后，生产劲头更大了。检查团5月3日在城关公社白杨管理区检查后，根据检查团检查出的问题，当晚召开电话会议，4日派三名干部到各生产队领导生产，一天内就灌溉小麦五百二十六亩，防治小麦条锈病一千四百二十六亩，修理和修改农具四百二十六件，给棉田补苗三百二十六亩，积肥三千六百四十六车。
    这次检查评比，发现了许多当前生产中带有普遍性的问题，也从群众中找到了解决这些问题的经验，这些经验也立即推广了。检查中，发现各地因经济作物面积扩大等原因，粮食播种面积有些减少后，又发现固市公社在“村边园田化，户户种玉米、南瓜”的口号下，利用宅前院后空地种植了二千二百多亩玉米、南瓜等，又在所有可以春播的土地上种了一百多亩早玉米。检查团就马上在全县推广这个公社的办法，在全县扩大粮食播种面积。检查发现在安排夏收工作中，有的地方针对小麦目前主要依靠人割，而今年小麦长得又高又密需要更多劳力的特点，采用以队为基础安排劳力，又在管理区、全社统一领导下等价换工互相调动劳力的办法。检查团肯定并推广了这一经验。检查中还总结推广了一些地方为棉田及夏种准备肥料的经验，在全县开展了突击积肥运动。
    组织大检查大评比，是这个县在生产大跃进中多次证明了的重要领导经验。这次检查评比又有以下几个特点：把从公社到生产小队逐级听取干部汇报和召集群众座谈、进行个别访问密切地结合起来；把走马观花和重点深入某一个生产队进行深入细致的检查结合起来；一方面检查先进单位，评选先进单位，颁发奖旗，树立榜样，帮助他们总结经验，现场推广；另一方面又检查落后单位，具体帮助找出原因，提出解决问题的办法，同时树立对立面，用好坏典型对比的实例，教育了广大干部和群众。
