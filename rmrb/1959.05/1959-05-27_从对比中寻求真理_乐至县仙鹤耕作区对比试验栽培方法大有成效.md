Beijing, May 26th (People's Daily) – In the Xianhe Cultivation Area of the Red Flag People's Commune in Lezhi County, Sichuan Province, extensive comparative experiments on different cultivation methods for various crops are being conducted to explore the laws for implementing the "Eight-Character Charter" in accordance with local conditions. Recently, by summarizing the experience of wheat production through widespread comparative experiments, they have effectively promoted the better implementation of advanced measures such as reasonable close planting and deep plowing in current autumn harvest crops.

From past years of continuous production increases, the Xianhe Cultivation Area has recognized the significant role of measures such as deep plowing, reasonable fertilization, reasonable irrigation, and reasonable close planting in increasing agricultural production. However, regarding specific practices, such as how much deep plowing is appropriate and what degree of close planting is best, there have been considerable debates among commune members. Last year, when sowing wheat, the cultivation area, adhering to the spirit of "boldly mobilizing the masses and testing everything," launched a mass movement of comparative experiments on different cultivation methods.

The cultivation area selected two cadres sent to the countryside, four experienced farmers, four middle-aged individuals, and seven young people to form a scientific experiment research group. They allocated over 20 mu of land specifically for conducting comparative experiments on different practices in deep plowing, close planting, variety selection, and fertilization. For example, in the key experiment of close planting, seven different seeding rates were compared on land with completely identical conditions, ranging from the lowest of 20 jin per mu to the highest of 60 jin. Each production brigade and production team also conducted small-scale experiments based on the most pressing issues to be solved in each team. Leading cadres at all levels universally established "experimental plots," participating in labor, conducting experiments, and guiding production simultaneously.

The results of various comparative experiments led to preliminary conclusions on many debates. For example, in terms of reasonable close planting, those who truly achieved deep plowing of one chi five cun, applied 100,000 jin of base fertilizer on first-class soil, and used a seeding rate of around 40 jin per mu under these conditions all achieved high yields of over 700 jin per mu. Among these, the best results were obtained with a seeding rate of 45 jin per mu, with yields as high as 800 jin per mu. Overly dense and overly sparse plantings both resulted in poor harvests. The results of experiments conducted by the brigade and team members themselves were generally the same. For example, the 1.7 mu of wheat cultivated by several members of the Youth Iron and Steel Company used 75 jin of seeds per mu. The wheat seedlings were very thin and weak, and the problem of ventilation and light transmission was not resolved, causing them to lodge early. Seeing the unfavorable situation, they thinned them out midway. In the two experimental fields cultivated by several commune members led by the old farmer He Decai of the Second Brigade, only about 10 jin of seeds were used per mu, with a row spacing of 9 cun to 1 chi square. Although they put a lot of effort into fertilization and management, the wheat stalks were somewhat longer than those in other wheat fields, but the yield was only about 200 jin per mu.

The unprecedented bumper harvest on 500 mu of high-yield wheat land in the entire cultivation area made the results of the comparative experiments even more convincing. The average yield of these high-yield lands was over 650 jin per mu, catching up with last year's rice yield. They all strictly adhered to the technical specifications of deep plowing around one chi five cun, applying over 80,000 jin of fertilizer, and using a seeding rate of 35 jin to 40 jin.

While mobilizing commune members to summarize the experience of wheat comparative experiments, the Xianhe Cultivation Area Party Branch also discussed and formulated cultivation technical regulations for this year's autumn harvest crops such as rice and cotton, and implemented them in the planting process of mid-season rice, cotton, and other crops.

The Xianhe District Party Branch felt that the role of comparative experiments was enormous and decided to continue conducting systematic experiments in the future, and increased the technical strength of the experiments. In addition to major crops such as rice and cotton, comparative experiments will also be conducted on other minor crops. At the same time, measures were taken to strengthen the leadership of the comparative experiments in brigades and teams, so as to make this work more effective.

    从对比中寻求真理
    乐至县仙鹤耕作区对比试验栽培方法大有成效
    本报成都26日电  四川省乐至县红旗人民公社仙鹤耕作区，大搞各种作物不同栽培方法的对比试验，从中摸索因地制宜贯彻执行“八字宪法”的规律。最近，他们通过总结小麦生产中普遍进行的对比试验的经验，有效地推动了当前在秋收作物中更好地执行合理密植、深耕等先进措施。
    仙鹤耕作区从过去连年增产的实践中，认识到深耕、合理施肥、合理灌溉、合理密植等措施对农业增产的重大作用。但是，在具体作法上，如深耕多少为宜，密植到什么程度最好，社员之间有不少争论。去年，该耕作区在播种小麦时，本着“放手发动群众，一切经过试验”的精神，开展了一个群众性的不同栽培方法对比试验运动。
    耕作区抽调了二个下放干部、四个老农、四个中年、七个青年，组成了科学试验研究组，划出二十多亩土地，专门进行深耕、密植、品种、施肥等方面不同作法的对比试验。如试验重点的密植一项，在其他条件完全相同的土地上就作了七种用种量不同的对比试验，每亩用种量由最少的二十斤到最高的六十斤。各生产大队、生产小队也根据各队最迫切需要解决的问题进行小型试验，各级领导干部普遍建立“试验田”，边参加劳动、边进行试验、边指导生产。
    各种对比试验的结果，使许多争论得到初步结论。如在合理密植方面，凡是甲等土，确实做到深耕一尺五寸、施底肥十万斤，在这个前提下每亩用种量四十斤左右的，都获得亩产七百斤以上的高额产量。其中又以每亩用种量四十五斤的为最好，亩产高达八百斤。过密和过稀的收成都很差。大队和各小队社员自己所作的试验结果大致都是一样。如青年钢铁连几个队员试验的一亩七分小麦，每亩用种量七十五斤，麦苗非常细弱，通风透光问题也没解决，很早就倒伏了，他们看势不妙，中途就把它匀稀了。二大队以老农何德材为首的几个社员种植的两块试验田，每亩只用了十多斤种子，窝行距是九寸到一尺的见方。尽管他们在施肥和管理上下了不少功夫，麦吊吊要比其他麦田长一些，但产量每亩只合二百多斤。
    全耕作区五百亩小麦高产地的空前大丰收，使对比试验的结果更富于说服力。这些高产地平均亩产都在六百五十斤以上，赶上去年水稻的产量。他们都是严格遵守深耕一尺五左右、施肥八万斤以上，用种量三十五斤到四十斤的技术规格执行的。
    仙鹤耕作区党总支在发动社员结合总结小麦对比试验经验的同时，还讨论和制定了今年水稻、棉花等秋收作物的栽培技术规程，并在中稻、棉花等作物的栽种过程中贯彻执行。
    仙鹤区党总支感到对比试验的作用巨大，决定今后继续进行系统的试验，并增加了试验的技术力量。除水稻、棉花等主要作物外，其他小宗作物也要进行对比试验。同时还采取措施，加强大队和小队对比试验工作的领导，以便使这一工作进行得更有成效。
