Xinhua News Agency, Benxi, May 15th. A delegation of employees from the Anshan Iron and Steel Company's Ironmaking Plant, led by the old hero Meng Tai, signed a friendly competition contract with employee representatives from the Benxi Iron and Steel Company's First and Second Iron and Steel Plants on May 13th.

The signing ceremony for their competition contract was held at the Beidi Club in Benxi City. Yan Mingchen, the furnace chief of Ansteel's No. 3 blast furnace, which recently set a high-yield record for large blast furnaces, represented the employees of Ansteel's No. 9 and No. 3 blast furnaces at the meeting and issued a challenge to the employees of Benxi Iron and Steel Company's Second Iron and Steel Plant's No. 2 blast furnace. He proposed: the utilization coefficient of the No. 3 and No. 9 blast furnaces should reach 2.2 in the near future, and after a short period, it is planned to increase it to 2.3, and then after another period to 2.4, guaranteeing that 99% of the pig iron quality is up to standard. The measures to achieve this goal are to extensively mobilize the masses, vigorously promote technological innovation, maintain the furnaces well, and further develop internal competition among workers of the same type. Employee representatives from Benxi Iron and Steel Company's First and Second Iron and Steel Plants also announced their competition conditions.

Liu Baoyi, chairman of the Anshan Ironmaking Plant's trade union, then represented the three ironmaking plants of Anshan and Benxi and read out the competition contract. The contract stipulated that the employees of the three plants are determined to strive to achieve the goal of a blast furnace utilization coefficient of 2.4; proactively exchange advanced experience in improving pig iron quality and output; strengthen collaboration and further support each other; and after the competition, conduct evaluations and reward the winners. Li Wenfu, secretary of the Benxi Municipal Party Committee Secretariat, spoke at the contract signing ceremony. He pointed out that the friendly competition between the two main forces on China's steel front—the employees of Anshan Iron and Steel and Benxi Iron and Steel—helping each other, learning from each other, and improving together is of great significance for achieving this year's steel production tasks.

Before the signing of this contract, the employees of the Anshan and Benxi ironmaking plants had already launched competition activities. After the employees of Benxi Iron and Steel Company's First Iron and Steel Plant issued a proposal to launch a red flag competition to ironmaking plants across the country in February this year, the employees of Anshan Iron and Steel Company's Ironmaking Plant immediately responded. At the end of March, a delegation of employees from the Anshan Ironmaking Plant went to Benxi to systematically learn advanced ironmaking experience. In April, when the Benxi ironmaking employees heard that Anshan Iron and Steel Company's No. 3 and No. 9 blast furnaces had created high-yield records, they immediately sent technicians to Anshan to learn experience. Now, a system of exchanging production information has been established between these three plants, and people are regularly sent to observe and learn each other's advanced operating techniques.

    老英雄孟泰下战表
    决心同本溪比高低
    条件是：利用系数向二点四奋斗质量保证达到99％
    新华社本溪15日电　以老英雄孟泰为首的鞍山钢铁公司炼铁厂职工代表团，5月13日同本溪钢铁公司第一和第二钢铁厂的职工代表，签订了一项友谊竞赛合同。
    他们的竞赛合同的签字仪式，是在本溪市北地俱乐部举行的。最近创造了大型高炉高产纪录的鞍钢三号高炉炉长阎明臣，在会上代表鞍钢九号和三号高炉的职工，向本钢第二钢铁厂二号高炉职工下了挑战书。他提出：三号和九号高炉的利用系数最近要达到二点二，过一个短时期准备提高到二点三，再过一个时期提高到二点四，保证99％的生铁质量合格。实现这一指标的措施是广泛发动群众，大闹技术革新，维护好炉子，进一步开展内部同工种竞赛。本钢第一和第二钢铁厂的职工代表，也相继宣布了他们的竞赛条件。
    鞍钢炼铁厂工会主席刘宝义，接着代表鞍钢和本钢的三个炼铁厂，宣读了竞赛合同书。合同书上规定，三个厂的职工决心为实现高炉利用系数达到二点四的目标而努力；主动地交流提高生铁质量产量的先进经验；加强协作，进一步互相支援；在竞赛结束以后，进行评比，奖励优胜者。中共本溪市委书记处书记李文甫，在合同签字仪式上讲了话。他指出，我国钢铁战线上的两支主力军——鞍钢和本钢的职工，通过友谊竞赛，互相帮助，互相学习，共同提高，对于实现今年的钢铁生产任务有着重要的意义。
    在这次签订合同以前，鞍钢和本钢炼铁厂的职工，早已展开了竞赛活动。今年2月份，本钢第一钢铁厂职工向全国炼铁厂发出开展红旗竞赛的倡议以后，鞍钢炼铁厂的职工立刻响应。3月末，鞍钢炼铁厂职工代表团到本钢系统地学习了先进的炼铁经验。4月份，本钢炼铁职工听到鞍钢三号和九号高炉创造了高产纪录，又立刻派技术人员去鞍钢学习经验。现在，这三个厂之间，建立了互通生产情况的制度，经常不断派人观摩和学习对方的先进操作技术。
