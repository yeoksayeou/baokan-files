    The Great "May Fourth"
    Gao Shiqi
    "May Fourth!" Great "May Fourth," you are the day of awakening for the Chinese nation. In the hearts of all Chinese people, you have left an indelible
  memory. You brought new life and endless hope to the motherland. Today is your fortieth anniversary, and we cheer and applaud you. Forty years ago today: Beijing students gathered in Tiananmen Square, parading and demonstrating in a mighty procession, the flames of anger burning down Zhao Jia Lou. From this day on: Throughout the land of the motherland, loud youth songs resounded everywhere, and the momentum of students and workers rose higher and higher.
  From this day on: Our great motherland, from the countryside to the city, underwent earth-shattering changes. The Communist Party of China was born! It leads us: from darkness to light, from victory to greater victory. You have spent many years of arduous struggle,
  advancing on the bloodstained footprints of countless martyrs, and finally removed the three great mountains weighing down on the people's heads, and 600 million people have achieved complete liberation.
  Like ten thousand horses galloping a thousand miles a day, the motherland has once again set off a high tide of building socialism, and the giant waves of the Great Leap Forward are impacting the shores of cultural and technological revolution, wave after wave. Now, the frantic upper-class reactionaries in Tibet,
  and foreign interventionists, dare to despise the power of the Chinese people, vainly attempting to undermine the unity and peace of the motherland. The iron fists of 600 million people will surely smash all reactionary conspiracies to pieces. The anger of 600 million people will surely burn all arrogant attempts to ashes.

    伟大的“五四”
    高士其“五四”！伟大的“五四”，你是中华民族觉醒的日子，在全中国人民的心窝里，你留下了永远不可磨灭的记
  忆。你给祖国带来了新生和无穷的希望。今天是你四十周年纪念日，我们向你欢呼鼓掌。四十年前的今天：北京学生集会在天安门前，浩浩荡荡游行示威，愤怒的火焰烧毁赵家楼。从这一天起：在祖国的大地上，到处响起了嘹亮的青年歌声，学生和工人的声势越来越高
  涨。从这一天起：我们伟大的祖国，从乡村到城市，发生了翻天复地的变化。中国共产党诞生了！它领导着我们：从黑暗走向光明，从胜利走向更大的胜利。你渡过了多少艰苦斗争的岁
  月，踏着无数先烈的血迹前进，终于搬走了压在人民头上的三
  座大山，六亿人民得到了完全的解放。万马奔腾一日千里，祖国又掀起了建设社会主义的
  高潮，大跃进的巨浪一浪高过一浪冲击着文化和技术革命的海
  岸。现在丧心病狂的西藏上层反动
  分子，和外国干涉者们，竟敢蔑视中国人民的力量，妄想破坏祖国的统一与和平。六亿人民的铁拳一定要把一切反动阴谋打得粉
  碎。六亿人民的怒火一定要把一切狂妄企图烧成灰
  烬。
