Chairman, fellow delegates:
    At this conference, we have heard the cheers of the people of all ethnic groups across the country for the suppression of the rebellion by the reactionary upper strata in Tibet, and we have also heard the condemnation of imperialists and foreign reactionaries for interfering in China's internal affairs. This is the voice of justice from China's 650 million people. We, as scientific and cultural workers, stand with the delegates present and the people of the whole country in resolutely supporting the government's measures to quell the rebellion by the reactionary upper strata in Tibet, and we express our utmost anger at the imperialists and foreign reactionaries' conspiratorial activities to interfere in our country's internal affairs by taking advantage of the Tibetan rebellion!
    Tibet has always been an inseparable part of our country's territory. It is entirely our internal affair for our people to quell an armed rebellion on our own territory, and no one has any right to interfere. This is a matter of course. However, Indian expansionists have become ambitious and are making a big fuss about the Tibet issue, stirring up a countercurrent of abandoning the Bandung spirit, opposing China, and undermining Sino-Indian friendly relations. They have even openly supported the rebellion by the reactionary upper strata in Tibet, publicly expressing so-called "complete sympathy" for the rebels, clamoring that "Tibet is an independent country," and slanderously smearing our country's legitimate action to quell the Tibetan rebellion as "endangering Asian unity." They have also allowed the rebels to do whatever they want in Kalimpong. Regarding the Indian expansionists' vicious attacks on our country's fallacies and unfriendly actions, the Chinese people have always valued Sino-Indian friendly relations and have exercised great restraint. However, the Indian expansionists have misjudged the situation, thinking that our overall consideration is weakness and can be bullied, and have become increasingly reckless, blatantly using the name of the kidnapped Dalai Lama to issue two self-deceiving so-called "statements of the Dalai Lama." Moreover, Indian expansionists have also gathered their followers to hold so-called "demonstrations" and parades, and even insulted the portrait of our people's great leader in front of the police. This is simply a serious provocation to the Chinese people. Is this tolerable? Can our people remain silent?
    The various malicious slanders and conspiracies of Indian expansionists against our country cannot stand the light of day. Tibet is Chinese territory, and China's sovereignty over Tibet is recognized worldwide. Indian Prime Minister Nehru also pointed out in his speech to the Indian People's Assembly on May 15, 1954, that he criticized certain remarks attempting to obliterate China's sovereignty in Tibet, saying, "In the past hundreds of years, I don't know at any time, any foreign country has ever denied China's sovereignty in Tibet." Is it possible that the sovereignty of China in Tibet, which Mr. Nehru himself said that no country has denied for hundreds of years, can be obliterated by a wild clamor of Indian expansionists? If it is said that Tibetans should be "independent" because they are not Han Chinese, then, according to the logic of Indian expansionists, the residents of the Ladakh region in India are also Tibetans, so can Ladakh also establish an independent country? As for the two so-called "statements of the Dalai Lama," they are full of lies and loopholes. Not only did they make a big joke of the Dalai Lama authorizing the Dalai Lama to write the statement, but the more they talked, the more confused they became, and the more the matter became clear. The fox's tail was completely exposed in broad daylight.
    If China's sovereignty over Tibet has ever been damaged, it is also a fact. However, this is entirely the result of imperialist aggression against Tibet. Not only can it never become a reason to deny China's sovereignty over Tibet, but on the contrary, it will only further arouse the old and new hatred of our people. The Chinese people will never forget the imperialists, especially the British imperialists, for their barbaric and despicable long-term aggression against Tibet. Since launching armed aggression against Tibet twice in 1886 and 1904, they have always coveted this treasure land. Within the Tibetan ruling group, they bought over a small number of national scum who were willing to recognize thieves as their fathers, acting as agents of British imperialism, playing the ugly trick of so-called "Tibetan independence" in modern history, and attempting to split China. A major conspiracy of British imperialism has always been to attempt to use India to realize the "British Empire's" colonial rule over our country's Tibet region. However, history is merciless. Not only did the British imperialists' conspiracy to invade Tibet completely fail under the great palm of the Chinese people, but the British imperialists were also driven out of India by the great Indian people. Now, Indian expansionists, in violation of the will of the broad masses of the Indian people, have brazenly accepted the mantle of British imperialism, which has long been sent to the historical museum, and are attempting to shamelessly inherit Britain's "monopoly rights" in Tibet. For ulterior motives, they also use their traditional relationship with Britain to collude with British imperialism. Facts prove that the snake's head of the British imperialists has already emerged from the hole. A British Foreign Office spokesman said on the 20th, when talking about the so-called statement issued by the Dalai Lama in India, that the British government "is also maintaining close contact with the Indian government on this issue." A London Associated Press reporter pointed out that the British government is discussing with the Indian government whether to recognize China's right to govern Tibet in the future. The British "Manchester Guardian" openly encouraged India to "not be timid in front of China." The British "Daily Telegraph" then incited Nehru to "be bold." Isn't this British imperialism openly pointing fingers and issuing orders to Indian expansionists? However, imperialism is always imperialism. Indian interventionists have forgotten the disasters of the era of enslavement by British imperialism and are attempting to create a situation of colluding with British imperialism and interfering in China's internal affairs. This is not only a daydream, but will inevitably drag India into a trap and lead to endless troubles. This is absolutely intolerable to the broad masses of the Indian people. The Indian "Free Press" said it well: "Those who raise the slogan of 'Tibetan independence' and harm Sino-Indian relations are not only enemies of China, they are also the biggest enemies of India."
    The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence have become increasingly popular among the people of Asia and Africa and have increasingly strong vitality. Whoever caters to the will of imperialism and abandons the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence will be spurned by the people of Asia and Africa and will not have a good end. The Chinese people have always been loyal to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and have always strived tirelessly to defend the Five Principles. We never interfere in the internal affairs of other countries, and we will never allow others to interfere in our country's internal affairs. The Chinese people do not want an inch of land from other countries, but they will never let others take an inch of land away. Now is the era when the East Wind prevails over the West Wind, and it is the new China where 650 million people are masters of their own affairs. The days when imperialists and foreign reactionaries could arbitrarily interfere in China's internal affairs are long gone. The armed rebellion of the reactionary upper strata in Tibet has been quelled. The situation in the Tibet region is as stable as Mount Tai. The Tibetan people have since been freed from the shackles of the European medieval serf system and are accelerating the construction of a paradise on earth in the big family of the motherland. If imperialists and foreign reactionaries still have wishful thinking, then it is like what the ancient Chinese saying says, "An ant trying to shake a big tree is ridiculous and overestimates its own strength." Now is the time for imperialists and foreign reactionaries to clear their heads.

### 中国人民对印度干涉者的挑衅不能再沉默不理

    中国人民对印度干涉者的挑衅不能再沉默不理
    马寅初　竺可桢　邵力子　贝时璋　许宝驹　顾功叙　赵忠尧  刘开渠　董聿茂　潘天寿　陆士嘉　严景耀　唐巽泽　冯宾符  俞平伯　叶熙春　俞佐宸　倪斐君　童第周　蔡邦华　徐赤文代表的联合发言主席、各位代表：
    在这次大会中，我们听到了全国各族人民代表对于平息西藏上层反动集团叛乱的欢呼，也听到了对于帝国主义和外国反动派干涉中国内政的谴责，这是中国六亿五千万人民发出的正义的声音。我们，作为科学文化工作者，同在座的代表以及全国人民一样，坚决拥护政府平定西藏上层反动集团叛乱的措施，对帝国主义和外国反动派利用西藏叛乱事件进行干涉我国内政的阴谋活动，表示无比的愤怒！
    西藏从来是我国不可分割的领土，我国人民在自己的领土上平息武装叛乱完全是我国的内政，任何人绝对无权干涉，这是天经地义。但是，印度的扩张主义分子竟然野心勃发，在西藏问题上大做文章，掀起一个背弃万隆精神、反对中国、破坏中印友好关系的逆流。他们居然公开支持西藏上层反动集团叛乱，公然对叛乱分子表示什么“完全的同情”，叫嚣什么“西藏是独立的国家”，血口喷人地污蔑我国平息西藏叛乱的合法行动是
  “危害亚洲的团结”。他们还纵容叛乱分子在噶伦堡为所欲为。对于印度扩张主义分子这种恶毒攻击我国的谬论和不友好的行动，中国人民一直以中印友好关系为重，作了很大的克制。但是，印度的扩张主义分子却错误地估计了形势，以为我国的顾全大局是软弱可欺，竟至愈来愈胆大妄为，明目张胆地篡用被劫持的达赖喇嘛的名义，两次发表自欺欺人的所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”。甚至，印度扩张主义分子还纠集党徒，举行所谓“示威”游行，并且当着警察面前，侮辱我国人民伟大领袖的画像，这简直是对中国人民的严重挑衅，是可忍，孰不可忍？难道我国人民还能默尔而息吗？
    印度扩张主义分子种种对我国的恶毒诽谤和阴谋活动，是见不得天日的。西藏是中国的领土，中国对西藏的主权是全世界所公认的。印度总理尼赫鲁先生也曾经在一九五四年五月十五日在印度人民院的演说中，指责过某些企图抹煞中国在西藏主权的言论，他说：“在已往数百年当中，我就不知道在任何时候，任何一个外面的国家曾经否认过中国在西藏的主权”。尼赫鲁先生自己所说的数百年来没有一个国家所能否认的中国在西藏的主权，难道是印度扩张主义分子的一阵狂妄叫嚣所能抹煞得了吗？如果说，因为西藏人不是汉人而应当“独立”，那么，按照印度扩张主义分子的逻辑，印度境内的拉达克地方的居民也是西藏人，是不是拉达克也可以成立独立国家呢？至于两个所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”，更是谎话连篇，漏洞百出，不但闹出达赖喇嘛授权达赖喇嘛写声明的大笑话，而且话越说越糊涂，事情反而越来越清楚，狐狸尾巴完全露在光天化日之下了。
    如果说，中国对西藏的主权曾经遭受过损害，倒也是事实。但是，这完全是帝国主义侵略西藏的结果，不但绝不能够成为否认中国对西藏主权的理由，相反地，只有更加激起我国人民的旧仇新恨。中国人民永远不能忘怀帝国主义，首先是英帝国主义对西藏的野蛮卑鄙的长期侵略，从一八八六年和一九○四年两次发动武装侵略西藏以来，它就一直觊觎这块宝地，他们在西藏统治集团内部，收买一小撮甘愿认贼作父的民族败类，作为英帝国主义的代理人，玩弄近代历史上所谓“西藏独立”的丑把戏，妄图分裂中国。英帝国主义历来的一个重大阴谋，就是企图利用印度来实现“大英帝国”对我国西藏地方的殖民统治。但是，历史无情，不但英帝国主义侵略西藏的阴谋在伟大中国人民的巨掌下，彻底破了产，而且英帝国主义还被伟大的印度人民从印度赶了出去。现在印度扩张主义分子，违反印度广大人民的意志，竟然接受早已送入历史博物馆的英帝国主义的衣钵，妄图无耻地继承英国在西藏的“垄断权利”，他们为了不可告人的目的，还利用其与英国的传统关系，而与英帝国主义相勾结。事实证明：英帝国主义者的蛇头早已从洞里伸了出来。英国外交部发言人二十日在讲到所谓达赖喇嘛在印度发表的声明时说：英国政府“还同印度政府就这个问题保持密切联系”。伦敦美联社记者指出，英国政府正在同印度政府讨论将来是否承认中国有权管辖西藏。英国“曼彻斯特卫报”公然鼓励印度“在中国面前是无须胆怯的。”英国“每日电讯报”则怂恿尼赫鲁“大胆起来”，这不是英帝国主义对印度扩张主义分子公然指手划脚，发号施令吗？然而，帝国主义总是帝国主义。印度干涉者忘记了在英帝国主义奴役时代的祸灾，竟然妄图造成与英帝国主义狼狈为奸、干涉中国内政的局面，这不但是白日痴梦，而且必将把印度拖入陷阱，招致无穷的后患。这是印度广大人民所绝对不能容许的。印度“自由报”说得好：“那些提出‘西藏独立’口号，危害印中关系的人，不仅是中国的敌人，他们也是印度最大的敌人”。
    和平共处的五项原则，已经在亚非人民中越来越深入人心，具有越来越强大的生命力。谁要迎合帝国主义的意旨，背弃和平共处的五项原则，谁就会遭到亚非人民的唾弃，不会有什么好的下场。中国人民一贯忠实于和平共处五项原则，并始终为捍卫五项原则而不懈奋斗。我们从来不干涉别国的内政，也决不容许别人干涉我国的内政。中国人民不要别国一寸土地，但也决不让别人抢走一寸土地。现在是东风压倒西风的时代，是六亿五千万人民当家作主的新中国，帝国主义和外国反动派可以任意干涉中国内政的日子，早已一去不复返了。西藏上层反动集团的武装叛乱已经平息。西藏地方的局势稳如泰山。西藏人民从此摆脱了欧洲中世纪式农奴制度的枷锁，正在祖国大家庭中加速建设人间乐园。帝国主义和外国反动派如果还要痴心妄想，那正像中国古话所说，蚍蜉撼大树，可笑不自量。现在应该是帝国主义和外国反动派清醒头脑的时候了。
