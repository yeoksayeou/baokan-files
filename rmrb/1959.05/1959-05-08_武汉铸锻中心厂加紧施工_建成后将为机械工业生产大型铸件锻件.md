Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 7th - The construction project of the Wuhan Casting and Forging Center Factory has entered a construction high tide.

　　The Wuhan Casting and Forging Center Factory is one of the key national projects. After it is completed and put into production, it will produce large castings and forgings for the machinery industry, which is of great significance for solving the key problems in manufacturing heavy machinery.

　　The Wuhan Casting and Forging Center Factory officially started construction in August last year. Currently, fifteen construction projects are under full construction, including the hydraulic press workshop, as well as the gas generating station, boiler room, substation, chimney project, etc. In the process of hoisting the columns and roof trusses of the hydraulic press workshop, workers adopted advanced hoisting methods and completed the factory building shell project ahead of schedule. When civil engineering construction workers were laying the foundation for the hydraulic press, they adopted a parallel cross-operation method in which carpenters, scaffolders, and steel bar workers worked simultaneously, completing the foundation project five days ahead of schedule. The hydraulic press has now been transported to the construction site and will soon be installed.

　　In order to complete this project as soon as possible and put it into production, relevant units in Wuhan City are vigorously supporting it in accordance with the spirit of "the whole country as one chessboard". Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation has allocated some construction machinery and labor to this project for use; the transportation department has also used trains and automobiles to deliver a large number of building materials to the construction site as soon as possible.

　　武汉铸锻中心厂加紧施工
    建成后将为机械工业生产大型铸件锻件
    新华社武汉7日电　武汉铸锻中心厂建设工程进入施工高潮。
    武汉铸锻中心厂是国家重点工程之一。它建成投入生产后，将为机械工业生产大型铸锻件，对于解决当前制造重型机械中的关键问题具有重要意义。
    武汉铸锻中心厂是去年8月正式开工的，目前有十五个工程项目全面施工，其中包括水压机车间，以及煤气发生站、锅炉房、变电站、烟囱工程等。工人们在吊装水压机车间柱子、屋架的过程中，采用了先进的吊装方法，提前完成了厂房外壳工程。土木建筑工人在打水压机基础的时候，采用了木工与架子工、钢筋工并进的平行交叉作业法，提前五天完成了基础工程。现在水压机已经运到工地，不久即将开始安装。
    为了使这项工程尽早建成并投入生产，武汉市各有关单位正根据“全国一盘棋”的精神大力予以支援。武汉钢铁公司调拨了一部分施工机械和劳动力供这项工程使用；交通运输部门也用火车、汽车把大批建筑材料尽早源源送到施工地点。
