    Anshan Electric Power Bureau's Primary Substation
    Sets Record of 1,000 Days of Safe Power Supply
    (Our dispatch) Under the leadership of the Party committee, the employees of the Anshan Electric Power Bureau's primary substation, through the methods of extensive airing of views, big-character posters, and great debates, eliminated the conservative thinking of some individuals who believed that "people are subject to natural disasters and illnesses, so with so much equipment in the primary substation, accidents are inevitable." Since the Great Leap Forward in 1958, they have successively launched three campaigns to eliminate equipment defects, vigorously carrying out technical revolution and technical innovation centered on safe power supply, and widely promoting live-line operation methods. Through the long-term hard work and ingenuity of all employees, a total of more than 76,000 equipment defects were eliminated, of which more than 1,500 were major equipment defects. At the same time, the employees of the primary substation also strictly implemented the "five fixings" and "six strictnesses" system, including "regular equipment appraisal and inspection," "strict allocation of safety system personnel," and "strict safety inspections." By April 11, 1959, they had created a record of 1,000 days of safe power supply. The primary substation's maintenance of 1,000 days of safe power supply has played a significant role in ensuring the safe production of Anshan Iron and Steel. (Attached picture)

    鞍山市供电局一次变电所
    创千日安全供电纪录
    本报讯　鞍山市供电局一次变电所职工，在党委领导下，通过大鸣大放大字报和大辩论，扫除了某些人员存在的“人还有个天灾病热，一次变电所这么多的设备那能不出事故”的保守思想，自1958年大跃进以来，先后掀起三个围剿设备缺陷的战役，围绕安全供电大闹技术革命和技术革新，广泛地推行了带电操作法。经过全所职工长期苦干巧干，共消灭了七万六千多件设备缺陷，其中属于重大设备缺陷的有一千五百余件。与此同时，一次变电所职工又严格地执行了“定期进行设备鉴定和巡视”、严格安全系统人员的配备”、“严格安全检查”等“五定”、六严格”制度，到1959年4月11日，创出了一千天安全供电的纪录。一次变电所保持一千天的安全供电，对保证鞍钢安全生产起了重大作用。（附图片）
