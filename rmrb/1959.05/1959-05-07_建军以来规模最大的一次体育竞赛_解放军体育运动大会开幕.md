After the march-in ceremony, the military band played the national anthem, and the Second Sports Meet of the People's Liberation Army officially began.

General Tan Zheng, Director of the General Political Department, spoke amidst warm applause. He said that the army-wide sports meet has been held seven years since 1952. In these seven years, in accordance with the Party Central Committee’s sports policy of "strengthening the people's physique and serving production labor and national defense construction," we have vigorously strengthened the military sports training of the troops and carried out mass amateur sports activities. Like other tasks, we have also achieved great results in this regard. In the past few years, our army has trained a good sports team. We have nearly one million people who have reached the "Labor and Defense System" standard, and there are more than 70 sports masters, more than 45,000 graded athletes and more than 5,000 referees; in participating in various sports activities at home and abroad, have achieved the winning scores of certain projects.

General Tan Zheng said that the primary purpose of holding sports meets, conducting sports competitions, selecting outstanding athletes, and striving to create new records is to attract and awaken more and more people to pay attention to sports and love sports through competitions and the creation of new records, so that sports activities can be widely carried out within the army, so as to strengthen the physical fitness of military personnel and improve the combat effectiveness of the troops. He called on all athletes and referees to continue to study, work hard to improve, not be arrogant or impetuous, and strive to create excellent results.

After General Tan Zheng's speech, a flower presentation team composed of 25 female athletes from the Army, Navy, and Air Force presented flowers to Chairman Zhu De and other leaders on the rostrum. The audience burst into thunderous applause.

More than 400 Young Pioneers from Beijing then presented flowers to the People's Liberation Army athletes to pay tribute to the PLA uncles who guarded their happy childhood.

As the People's Liberation Army athletes sprinkled large bunches of鲜花(fresh flowers) to the surrounding stands, two helicopters flew over the venue and sprinkled colorful flowers over the audience as a salute. The sky above the venue was suddenly colorful, like a rain of flowers falling from the sky. The applause and cheers from the audience became one, and the audience's joyful and enthusiastic emotions reached their peak.

Next, a wonderful gymnastics performance began. The neat, mighty, brave, and vigorous bayonet drills performed by 600 soldiers from the Beijing Military Region won warm praise, applause, and cheers from the audience. The children's exercises, workers' exercises, farmers' exercises, and girls' exercises performed by more than 6,700 middle school students and Young Pioneers in Beijing were also warmly welcomed by the audience. Finally, the "August 1st" team and the Beijing team held a wonderful football demonstration match.

There are a total of 43 competition events in this sports meet. Among them, 25 competitions such as horse racing, sailing, chess, wrestling, martial arts, and parachute jumping have been conducted in advance in Kaifeng, Pingliang, Nanjing, Wuxi, Wuhan, Dalian and other places in March and April.
