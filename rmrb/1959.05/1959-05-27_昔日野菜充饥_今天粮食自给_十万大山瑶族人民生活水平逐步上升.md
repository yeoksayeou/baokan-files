Xinhua News Agency, Nanning, 26th - The production and living standards of the Yao people scattered in the Shiwan Mountains in the southern Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region are gradually rising.

The Yao people of the Shiwan Mountains live in three townships of Shangsi County, with sixty-five villages. Before liberation, they were almost isolated from the outside world. There were no schools in the entire Shiwan Mountains, and none of the Yao people had received any education. Production had long remained in the primitive "slash-and-burn" method, and grain yields were extremely low. According to investigations, in the relatively wealthy Longyin Village of Miqiang Township, in 1949, the average person had 172 jin of grain. The entire village of thirteen households and eighty-nine people only had two mosquito nets, two cotton quilts, and ninety-six sets of clothes. In the poorer Miyuan Village of Changlong Township, the average person only had 76 jin of grain, and the entire village had no mosquito nets or cotton quilts. The poorest, Milou Village of Nanggui Township, had nothing except the clothes on their backs, wandering everywhere, relying entirely on digging up wild vegetables to fill their hunger. These Yao people, living through tragic years, eagerly longed for liberation. When the underground guerrilla forces of the Chinese Communist Party entered the Shiwan Mountains in 1948, the Yao people actively supported them. Outstanding Yao children like Li Guangde joined the guerrillas, fighting alongside the Han and Zhuang people.

In the years since liberation, under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, and with the support and assistance of the Han and Zhuang people, the production and living standards of the Yao people in the Shiwan Mountains have gradually risen. In 1956, most Yao farmers joined agricultural production cooperatives, resolutely taking the socialist road. Last autumn, in the upsurge of the people's communes throughout the country, they held high red flags, beat gongs and drums, and applied to the local Party Committee to join the people's commune. From then on, the three Yao townships and the two neighboring townships jointly established the Unity People's Commune. This year, the cultivated area of the Yao townships has been expanded, and field management has been strengthened. Advanced technical measures such as close planting, fertilization, and early plowing have been adopted. The Yao people of the Shiwan Mountains are now self-sufficient in grain. At the same time, seven primary schools have been established in the three Yao townships, and literacy training classes have been held, beginning literacy campaigns among the Yao people. The commune has also established a hospital, and medical personnel regularly go to the countryside to treat illnesses. This year, according to the actual conditions of the Shiwan Mountains, the Yao people have revised their production increase plan, reformed some backward production habits, and continued to achieve the Great Leap Forward.

    昔日野菜充饥  今天粮食自给
    十万大山瑶族人民生活水平逐步上升
    新华社南宁26日电  散居在广西僮族自治区南部十万大山的瑶族人民生产和生活水平逐步上升。
    十万大山瑶族人民聚居在上思县的三个乡里，有六十五个村庄，解放前几乎与外界隔绝，整个十万大山没有一所学校，瑶族人民也没有一个读过书的。生产上长期保持“刀耕火种”原始方法，粮食产量极低。据调查，较富的米强乡龙因屯，1949年平均每人有粮食一百七十二斤，全屯十三户八十九人只有蚊帐两床、棉被两床、衣服九十六套；较穷的常隆乡米岩屯每人平均只有粮食七十六斤，全屯没有一床蚊帐和棉被；最穷的南桂乡米楼屯，人们除有随身衣服外一无所有，到处飘泊，全靠挖野菜充饥。这些过着悲惨岁月的瑶族人民，如饥如渴地盼望解放。1948年中国共产党地下游击武装进入十万大山时，瑶族人民积极支援，优秀的瑶家儿女李广德等参加了游击队，和汉族、僮族人民一起并肩作战。
    解放几年来，十万大山的瑶族人民在共产党和人民政府领导下和汉族、僮族人民的支援帮助下，生产和生活水平逐步上升。1956年大部分瑶族农民都参加了农业生产合作社，坚决走社会主义道路。去年秋天，在全国人民公社化高潮中，他们高举红旗、敲锣打鼓地到当地党委会申请加入人民公社。从此，三个瑶族乡和邻近的两个乡，联合成立了团结人民公社。这一年，瑶族乡的耕地面积扩大了，并加强了田间管理，采用了密植、施肥、早耕等先进技术措施，十万大山瑶族人民的粮食已能自给。同时，三个瑶族乡建立了七所小学，并且举办了扫盲训练班，开始在瑶族人民中进行扫盲。公社还成立了一座医院，经常有医疗人员下乡治病。今年，瑶族人民根据十万大山的实际情况，修订了增产计划，对一些落后的生产习惯进行了改革，继续实现大跃进。
