    Random Notes on Wolonggang
    Peng Rutong

    Wolonggang (Sleeping Dragon Ridge) is located about seven li west of Nanyang City. It's a ridge of earth rising from the flat ground, several li long from north to south, higher in the south and lower in the north, resembling a quietly reclining dragon. Legend has it that this was where Zhuge Liang of the Han Dynasty lived in seclusion and farmed. Today, there is still a stone tablet on the ridge that reads "Site of Farming by Wu Hou (Marquis Wu) of the Han Dynasty," as well as the Wu Hou Shrine built by later generations.

    The terrain around Wolonggang is exceptionally majestic and beautiful. To the south, the Baihe River winds around its waist, and to the east, it reflects the ancient city of Nanyang. To the west of the ridge, gullies intersect, hills and valleys undulate, rivers crisscross, and green trees cover the sky. The Deng (County) to Nan (yang) highway stretches westward from Nanyang, traversing the southern end of Wolonggang, making it a uniquely blessed scenic area.

    Although Wolonggang is a scenic spot people yearn for, to the native Nanyang people, pre-liberation Wolonggang was synonymous with all disasters. At that time, floods, droughts, locusts, and Tang (referring to Tang Enbo) were the four mountains weighing down on the people of Nanyang. People were used to using "eating chaff and swallowing vegetables" to describe poverty and disaster, but in those days, how could the people here even find chaff and vegetables to fill their stomachs! They could only rely on stripping tree bark and digging grass roots to survive. In addition, Wolonggang's special terrain conditions turned it into a place where bandits gathered and looted. In broad daylight, thugs could rob passersby with a curved cucumber wrapped in red silk! Later, the Kuomintang army occupied the Wu Hou Shrine as a barracks. They wantonly felled ancient cypresses and destroyed buildings. By the time of liberation, Wolonggang was a scene of desolation. The Wu Hou Shrine's walls had collapsed, the pavilions and towers were leaning and about to fall, the ancient cypresses that remained were few and far between, and Zhuge Liang's statue was covered in scars! At that time, the people of Wolonggang sang with grief and indignation:

        There is no dragon on Wolonggang,
        Zhuge Kongming has no spirit;
        Wolong helplessly returns to the sea,
        Zhuge secretly returns to Longzhong.
        The gods cannot manage themselves,
        The people suffer poverty for generations;
        A stick and a bowl,
        When will the life of begging end?

    I've been away from Wolonggang for eleven years, and now I have the opportunity to come here again. Revisiting the old place, I am filled with emotions.

    It's a spring morning, the sun is warm, the breeze is pleasant, the wheat seedlings on the ridge are turning green, and tender grass carpets the path. In a lush pine forest, the magnificent architecture of the Wu Hou Shrine stands tall. The peach blossoms are just beginning to bloom, and clusters of red flowers are scattered among the green trees and red walls. Nature uses its expressive techniques to paint a picture of Wolonggang that is both antique and full of vitality.

    Following the constant stream of people, stepping up a dozen stone steps along the forest path, we ascend Wolonggang. A huge stone archway inscribed with "Eternal Paragon of Humanity" stands facing us. The stone-carved dragons and tigers on the archway are meticulously crafted, lifelike, and realistic. Together with the several ancient cypresses inside the shrine that pierce the blue sky, they demonstrate the bold and strong character of the Nanyang people.

    In order to protect this famous historical site, the Party and the government renovated Wolonggang last year. The Wu Hou Shrine, with its green bricks, gray tiles, red doors, and green windows, has a unique charm. The Zhuge Liang's thatched cottage, which was already leaning and dilapidated before liberation, has been given a new thatched roof, restoring its original appearance. The centuries-old stinky mud under the small rainbow bridge has been removed. Now, the clear water fills the pond, reflecting the image of the thatched cottage very clearly. There are many stone carvings in the Wu Hou Shrine. The people of Nanyang often say that when something is numerous, "the stone tablets in the Wu Hou Shrine – you can't count them all." These stone tablets, which were discarded everywhere in the past, are now all embedded in the walls of the corridor. To say that the walls of the Wu Hou Shrine are made of stone carvings, I don't think it's an exaggeration at all. Unfortunately, during the rule of the old regime, some of the stone inscriptions have been damaged, which is a great loss.

    The scars on the statue of Wu Hou have also been thoroughly repaired. Kongming (Zhuge Liang), with his feather fan in hand, looks radiant and serene. No wonder people say: the common people have been liberated, and Zhuge Liang has also been liberated. If it weren't for the Communist Party, Kongming wouldn't even be able to wear new clothes. In the past, in front of the statue of Zhuge Liang, there was a censer as tall as a person, more than an arm's length thick. In peaceful times, the incense never stopped burning, and the statue was smoked black and yellow, and its beard broke off. Now, although the number of tourists has increased a hundredfold, people are no longer superstitious. What is placed on the altar is not incense and candles, but a few bouquets of bright flowers.

    Passing through Zhuge Liang's thatched cottage, not far away, we ascend the Half-Moon Terrace. The Half-Moon Terrace and the Qingfeng Tower are the highest points of Wolonggang. Legend has it that this is where Zhuge Liang recited at moonlight. The terrace is equipped with stone tables and stone benches for tourists to rest and look into the distance. It is a very elegant and tranquil place.

    Standing on the Half-Moon Terrace, overlooking Wolonggang and the entire Nanyang, the pavilions and towers hidden in the green trees on Wolonggang, and the dramatic changes in Nanyang City, will firmly grab your attention.

    A huge industrial network is being spread between Wolonggang and Nanyang City. Power plants, steel plants, rubber plants... are springing up one after another like bamboo shoots after a rain. Rows of huge chimneys pierce the blue sky, spewing rolling smoke, turning into wisps of clouds, wandering in the sky above Nanyang.

    The wheat seedlings in the fields are growing vigorously, showing a promising harvest. But the people of Nanyang don't seem to be satisfied. On the roads and on the ridges, the commune members are pulling carts and carrying burdens, applying piles of fertilizer to the wheat fields.

    A gentle breeze carries the faint sound of reading. A newly emerging cultural area in the Nanyang Plain is sprouting and growing near Wolonggang. Among the green trees, large areas of red houses are connected. Here are the Normal College and Educational Administration Cadre School for cultivating educational talent, the Agricultural College for training agricultural technicians, and well-equipped middle schools and primary schools. These schools have one thing in common: the students are almost all children of farmers, living a simple life and studying diligently.

    A comrade from Nanyang told me that the urban area of Nanyang is shifting towards Wolonggang. The planned highway has already been determined, and Wolonggang, as the future central area of Nanyang City, will be built into a Wolong Park that is fifty times larger than the existing area. The park will be planted with fruit trees and flowers, and Nanyang will become a garden city.

    When leaving Wolonggang, I saw a shepherd elder raising his whip and singing loudly, unrestrained and at ease. The bold and rough singing echoed at the tips of the ancient cypresses:

        There is a dragon on Wolonggang,
        Zhuge Kongming has a spirit,
        The dragon is the Communist Party,
        Chairman's kindness surpasses Kongming.
        The old man is seventy and refuses to admit old age,
        Serving as a "sheep commander" in the commune,
        Feeding the sheep like white clouds,
        Stepping on white clouds to go to Beijing.

    卧龙岗散记
    彭汝同
    卧龙岗在南阳城西约七里，是一条南北长数里，平地隆起的土岗，南高北低，似一条静卧的长龙。相传这里曾是汉诸葛亮隐居躬耕的地方，现今岗上还有“汉武侯躬耕处”的石碑，和后人修建的武侯祠。
    卧龙岗附近的地形异常雄伟秀丽。南有白河缠腰，东与南阳古城相映；岗西沟壑交错，岗峦起伏，河流纵横，绿树遮天；邓（县）南（阳）公路从南阳西伸，横贯在卧龙岗南端；是一个得天独厚的风景区。
    尽管卧龙岗是人们向往的风景胜地，但对土生土长的南阳人来说，解放前的卧龙岗，却是一切灾难的同义语。那时水、旱、蝗、汤（指汤恩伯），是压在南阳人民头上的四座大山。人们习惯用“吃糠咽菜”来形容贫困和灾难，可是那时这里的人何尝能捞到糠菜果腹！他们只能靠剥树皮，挖草根度日。加之卧龙岗特殊的地形条件，竟成了土匪啸聚抢掠之处，歹徒在光天化日之下，用根包着红绸的弯黄瓜就可以抢掠过路行人！后来，国民党军队又把武侯祠当作兵营盘踞。他们恣意砍伐古柏、破坏建筑，到临近解放时，卧龙岗已是满目凄凉。武侯祠园墙倒塌，亭台楼阁倾斜欲坠，古柏所存寥寥无几，诸葛塑像满身疮痕！当时，卧龙岗人悲忿的唱着：
        卧龙岗上没有龙，
        诸葛孔明没有灵；
        卧龙无奈归大海，
        诸葛偷偷回隆中。
        神灵不能管自己，
        百姓代代受贫穷；
        一根棍子一个碗，
        乞讨生活何时终？
    和卧龙岗阔别了十一年，现在我又有机会来到这里。旧地重游，感慨万端。
    这正是一个春天的上午，阳光和煦，清风宜人，岗坡上麦苗放青，嫩草铺径，在一片茁壮的松海里，耸立着武侯祠的壮丽建筑。时值桃花初放，几簇红花，星散在丛绿红墙之间，大自然用它的表现手法，为卧龙岗描绘出一幅古色古香、而又生气勃勃的画面。
    随着川流不息的人群，沿林间小路踏上十数级石阶，就登上了卧龙岗。一座书有“千古人龙”的巨大的石牌坊迎面立着。牌坊上的石刻龙虎，笔功细致逼真，栩栩如生；它和祠内的几株直插蓝天、刚劲苍健的古柏，共同显示出南阳人民豪放、坚强的性格。
    党和政府为了保护这一著名的古迹，在去年对卧龙岗进行了整修。武侯祠青砖灰瓦，红门绿窗，显得别有风致。解放前已经倾斜破漏的诸葛茅庐，加上了新的草顶，恢复了它当年的面貌。小虹桥下积存了几百年的臭泥被挖除了，现在碧水满池，能把茅庐的倒影映的十分清晰。武侯祠的石刻很多，南阳人形容什么东西多时，常说：武侯祠的石碑——数不过来。这些过去遍地遗弃的石碑，现在都已全部嵌入走廊的墙壁内。要说武侯祠的墙是用石刻砌成，我看一点也不夸张。可惜的是，在旧政权统治时代，有些石刻碑文已经碰损，这是一个很大的损失。
    武侯塑像的满身疮痕，也进行了彻底的修整。孔明手摇羽扇，神采奕奕，显得十分安详泰然。怪不得人们说：老百姓翻了身，诸葛亮也跟着翻了身，要不是共产党，孔明连身新衣服也穿不上。过去，诸葛亮像前放着一人高的香炉，有一抱多粗，太平年间，香火不断，塑像被熏得焦头烂额，发黄胡断。现在虽然游人成百倍的增加，但不再迷信了，放在神案上的不是香烛，而是几束鲜艳的花枝。
    穿过诸葛亮茅庐，不远就登上半月台。半月台和清风楼同是卧龙岗的最高点，传说是诸葛亮月夜诵读的地方，台中设有石桌石凳，可供游人小憩和远眺，是一个非常幽雅恬静的所在。
    站在半月台上，鸟瞰卧龙岗和南阳的全貌，卧龙岗上绿树丛中隐现的亭台楼阁，和南阳市的剧变，会紧紧的抓住你的视线。
    一个巨大的工业网，正在卧龙岗和南阳市区之间撒开，发电厂、钢铁厂、烤胶厂……像雨后春笋，一个接一个地破土成长。一排排巨大的烟囱直插蓝天，吐着滚滚的浓烟，变成丝丝云霞，在南阳上空游荡。
    田野里麦苗茁壮，显示出丰收在望；但南阳人似乎并不满足，在车道上，在田埂上，车拉肩挑，社员们正把成堆的肥料施入麦田。
    徐徐清风，送来了隐约的读书声，一个南阳平原新兴的文化区，正在卧龙岗附近抽芽成长。绿树丛中，大片大片的红色房舍毗连着。这里有培养教育人材的师范专科学校和教育行政干校，有培养农业技术人员的农业学院，有设备完善的中学、小学。这些学校有一个共同的特点，学生几乎全是农家子弟，生活朴素，勤奋好学。
    一个南阳同志告诉我，南阳市区正向卧龙岗转移，计划中的公路已经定线，作为未来南阳市中心区的卧龙岗，将建设成一个比现有范围扩大五十倍的卧龙公园，园内将满栽果树花卉，南阳将变成一个花园城市。
    离开卧龙岗时，看见一个牧羊老人正扬着牧鞭，放声高歌，豪放自若，粗犷的歌声，回翔在古柏尖头：
        卧龙岗上有了龙，
        诸葛孔明有了灵，
        卧龙就是共产党，
        主席恩情胜孔明。
        老汉七十不服老，
        公社里当“羊司令”，
        喂得羊儿似白云，
        脚踏白云上北京。
