Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, May 23rd: Chongqing is actively developing suburban non-staple food production through close collaboration between agricultural and commercial departments. They have adopted numerous concrete measures, vigorously mobilizing the masses to strive for self-sufficiency in three main non-staple foods: vegetables, pigs, chickens, and ducks.

    Starting last year, the Party and government leadership of Chongqing paid attention to fully leveraging the production potential of suburban rural areas to develop non-staple food production locally. Since the fourth quarter of last year, the city has basically achieved self-sufficiency in the vegetables needed by the population. This year, the suburban vegetable production base has been further expanded. Of the planned 340,000 mu of vegetable base, 250,000 mu have already been planted. Now, the city's residents can eat about one jin of fresh vegetables per person per day on average. This year, the number of pigs will increase from the current 930,000 to over 1.7 million; the number of small poultry has increased to over 2 million, and a large number of hatching eggs are being incubated. People's communes in the suburbs are also vigorously increasing the production of aquatic products, sugar raw materials, and oil crops.

    Unified leadership by the Party committee and close cooperation between agricultural and commercial departments are important guarantees for the rapid development of non-staple food production in the suburbs of Chongqing. The Chongqing Municipal Party Committee has designated 30% of the farmland in the suburbs as a base for developing non-staple food production, and has transferred a certain amount of labor to specialize in non-staple food production. Under the unified leadership of the Municipal Party Committee, agricultural and commercial departments have dispatched cadres to form full-time organizations at the municipal, district, and city-affiliated county levels to lead non-staple food production. Agricultural and commercial departments jointly discuss and determine the city's annual non-staple food production projects, quantities, and varieties, linking market sales plans with non-staple food production plans. The agricultural departments also cascade this plan down to the people's communes and production teams. Grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives further solidify the varieties, designs, and quantities of products by signing supply and marketing combination contracts with communes and production teams. To help communes develop production, organize transportation, and implement contracts, state-owned companies and wholesale stations have also dispatched more than 1,000 commercial personnel to go deep into the communes and production teams to provide long-term assistance.

    Chongqing's experience proves that in developing suburban non-staple food production, it is necessary to focus on concrete measures to ensure the implementation of the production plan. In order to properly arrange labor, agricultural and commercial departments, under the leadership of the Party committee, have drawn more than 190,000 agricultural laborers from various districts and counties under the city's jurisdiction to form more than 1,000 specialized production teams and seasonal production teams to manage non-staple food production. At the same time, agricultural and commercial departments have also helped people's communes establish 16 pumping stations, power stations, and more than 1,000 processing plants and farm tool factories. In terms of feed, the municipal grain department has allocated a batch of concentrated feed for raising pregnant sows, piglets, chicks, and ducklings. In terms of preventing and controlling livestock and poultry epidemics and vegetable diseases and insect pests, in addition to helping communes establish indigenous pesticide factories, the municipal commercial department has also organized the supply of swine erysipelas vaccines, swine fever vaccines, swine paratyphoid vaccines, and Newcastle disease vaccines to breeding units. Agricultural and commercial departments also held various training courses to help communes train more than 3,200 veterinarians, and promoted folk epidemic prevention experience. In general, swine diseases can basically be prevented and controlled.

    Launching mass movements and relying on the strength of all parties to develop non-staple food production is another characteristic of Chongqing's suburban non-staple food production development. This spring, districts and counties under the city's jurisdiction widely mobilized the masses to use various methods to incubate and raise small poultry, and quickly established more than 30 incubation rooms, which can incubate more than 1 million eggs at a time. In Shapingba District and other places, due to the uneven distribution of roosters and hens, commune members adopted the method of "roosters visiting, hens marrying out" to produce more hatching eggs for hatching chicks. Now, many communes are teeming with chickens and ducks, and every household is raising livestock and poultry. In terms of pig breeding, the city has launched a mass movement of "five comprehensives (comprehensive mating, comprehensive pregnancy, comprehensive birth, comprehensive survival, comprehensive robustness), raising more, and high yield." More than 84,000 of the 110,000 sows that can be mated have already been bred. The number of pigs being raised is increasing greatly. Chongqing has also widely mobilized urban residents, students, and factory and mine workers to help rural areas develop non-staple food production. Workers from many large factories, such as Chongqing Iron and Steel Company and Wangjiang Machine Factory, used waste materials to make water lifting tools and pushcarts and send them to nearby communes. Many factory workers and school teachers and students fertilized the land and sent fertilizer to the fields for the communes. When vegetables were harvested in large quantities and the communes lacked labor, the Municipal Vegetable Company organized consumers to help communes sort and transport vegetables. Organs, schools, factories, mines, and residents throughout the city also used vacant land, corners of houses, and wasteland to plant more than 140 million sunflowers, and some planted vegetables.

    商业和农业密切合作销售和生产全面衔接
    重庆力争菜、猪、鸡鸭自给          　
    据新华社重庆23日电　重庆市在发展郊区副食品生产中，农业部门和商业部门密切协作，采取了许多具体措施，大力发动群众，积极发展蔬菜、生猪、鸡鸭等三种主要副食品生产向着自给的方向努力。
    重庆市的党、政领导部门，从去年开始就注意了充分发挥郊区农村生产潜力，就地发展副食品生产，从去年第四季度以来，全市人民需要的蔬菜基本上做到自给。今年郊区蔬菜生产基地又有扩大，规划建立的三十四万亩蔬菜基地，已有二十五万亩种上了蔬菜。现在全市居民平均每天可以吃到鲜菜一斤左右。今年，猪将由目前的九十三万多头发展到一百七十万头以上；小家禽已增加到二百多万只，还有大批种蛋正在孵化。市郊人民公社还在大力增产水产品、食糖原料和油料作物等。
    党委统一领导，农林部门和商业部门密切协作，是重庆市郊区迅速发展副食品生产的重要保证。中共重庆市委在郊区划出30％的耕地作为发展副食品生产的基地，并抽调一定数量的劳力专门从事副食品生产。在市委的统一领导下，农林部门和商业部门都派出干部，组成了市、区和市属县各级领导副食品生产的专职机构。由农林、商业部门共同商议确定全市全年副食品生产的项目、数量、品种，把市场销售计划与副食品生产计划衔接起来。农林部门并把这个计划逐级下达到各个人民公社和生产队。基层供销社又通过与公社和生产队签订供销结合合同，把产品的品种、花色和数量固定下来。为了帮助公社发展生产、组织运输，实现合同，各国营公司和批发站还派出一千多名商业人员深入公社和生产队，长期帮助工作。
    重庆市的经验证明：在发展市郊副食品生产中，必须抓好具体措施，保证生产计划实现。为了妥善安排劳动力，农林部门和商业部门在党委领导下，从市郊各区和县抽出十九万多名农业劳动力，组成一千多个专业生产队和季节性生产队，经营副食品生产。同时农林部门和商业部门还帮助人民公社建立了抽水机站、发电站等十六处，各种加工厂、农具厂等一千多个。在饲料方面，市粮食部门拨出一批精饲料，供饲养怀孕母猪、乳猪和雏鸡、雏鸭用。在防治家禽家畜瘟疫和蔬菜病虫害方面，市商业部门除帮助公社建立土农药厂以外，还组织了猪丹疫苗、肺疫疫苗、猪副伤寒疫苗、鸡瘟疫苗等供给饲养单位。农林部门和商业部门还举办各种训练班，帮助公社训练了兽医人员三千二百多名，同时推广民间防疫经验，一般猪病基本上能够防治了。
    大搞群众运动和依靠各方面的力量来发展副食品生产，是重庆市郊发展副食品生产的另一个特点。今年春季，各区和市属各县广泛发动群众用各种办法孵化和饲养小家禽，很快就建立了三十多个孵化房，一次可孵化蛋一百多万个。沙坪坝区等地因公鸡、母鸡分布不均匀，社员们采取了“公鸡上门、母鸡出嫁”的办法，出产更多的种蛋，用来孵化小鸡。现在许多公社已经鸡鸭成群，家家户户养起了家畜、家禽。在生猪饲养方面，全市开展了“五全（全配、全孕、全生、全活、全壮），多养，高产”的群众运动，能配的十一万头母猪中已有八万四千多头配种。生猪的饲养头数正在大大增加。重庆市还广泛发动城市居民、学生和厂矿职工，帮助农村发展副食品生产。重庆钢铁公司、望江机器厂等许多大型工厂的职工用废旧材料制造提水工具、架架车等送给附近公社。许多工厂职工和学校师生，为公社积肥、送肥下田。蔬菜大量出土时，公社劳动力缺乏，市蔬菜公司组织消费者帮助公社整理和运输蔬菜。全市机关、学校、厂矿和居民也利用空土、屋角、荒坡种植了一亿四千多万株向日葵，有的种植了蔬菜。
