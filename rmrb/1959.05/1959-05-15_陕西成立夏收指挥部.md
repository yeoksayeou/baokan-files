Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, May 12th: Shaanxi Province established a Summer Harvest Command on May 10th to centrally lead the later-stage management of wheat fields and the summer harvest work. Zhao Boping, Secretary of the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, serves as the General Commander of the Command. Representatives from fifteen units, including the Rural Work Department of the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the Shaanxi Military Region, the Shaanxi Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry, the Department of Commerce, the Public Security Department, and the Women's Federation, are participating in this work.

After its establishment, the Command immediately strengthened its leadership over the late-stage management of wheat fields. On the evening of May 10th, Zhao Boping, on behalf of the Shaanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Shaanxi Provincial Summer Harvest Command, convened a telephone conference of Party secretaries at the prefectural, county, and commune levels. The conference demanded that all regions resolutely do a good job in the late-stage management of wheat, protecting the wheat until it ripens, until it is brought to the threshing floor, and until it is stored in the granary. The conference pointed out that Party secretaries at all levels must go deep into the production teams to check the growth and changes in wheat. Each production team must organize dedicated personnel to further strengthen the field management of wheat. The conference demanded that all regions immediately make the summer harvest the central task of the current rural work. Conscientious preparations must be made in terms of ideology, organizational leadership, labor and animal power arrangements, preparation of summer harvest tools, as well as living welfare.
