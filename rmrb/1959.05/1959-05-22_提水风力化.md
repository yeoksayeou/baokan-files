Wind Power for Water Lifting
Wei Jianyi, Deputy Secretary of the CPC Changwei Prefectural Committee

    Based on the achievement of mechanized wells in forty days of hard work last winter, Changwei Prefecture, Shandong Province, through two months of concerted efforts by the entire Party and all the people this spring, has realized the wind power conversion of water lifting tools throughout the region. We believe that using wind power for irrigation is a good way to remedy the current shortage of drainage and irrigation machinery and insufficient labor and animal power. Changwei Prefecture has manufactured and imitated more than 85,900 wind-powered waterwheels of six types, including automatic orientation type, horizontal turntable type, vertical turntable orientation type, spinning wheel type, horizontal windmill, and wind-powered hand-cranked combined windmill. More than 40,000 units have been installed and have undergone long-term testing during winter and spring irrigation. These waterwheels can rotate automatically with a wind force of about level three. One waterwheel can irrigate six mu of land per day and night, which is equivalent to three ordinary human or animal-powered waterwheels, saving a total of 120,000 laborers and 120,000 head of livestock. Among them, the automatic orientation type, vertical turntable orientation type, and wind-powered hand-cranked combined windmill are particularly effective due to their fast speed, large water lifting capacity, low cost, simple structure, durability, and usability in both strong and weak winds. Shouguang County, in order to better leverage the benefits of wind-powered vehicles, has built reservoirs next to all mechanized wells. Wind is used to store water, and when there is no wind, it becomes gravity flow. After being exposed to the sun, it can also turn yin water into yang water to facilitate irrigation.
    The realization of wind power has brought about tremendous changes on the production front throughout the region. This spring, not only was wheat able to receive enough water for greening and jointing in a timely manner, but also a large number of labor and livestock were freed up to strengthen intensive cultivation and fertilizer production. The masses praised the wind-powered waterwheel, saying: "Ten thousand acres of green and high-yielding wheat, no labor is needed to water it. As long as the Wind Goddess shouts, spring water gushes from the wells."
    The realization of wind power for water lifting tools throughout the region was not smooth sailing, but rather a result of fierce ideological struggles. After the local Party Committee issued the call to achieve wind power conversion of water lifting tools in two months of hard work, various forms of right-leaning conservative thinking were encountered among cadres and the masses. Therefore, we specifically organized a major debate, so that everyone, through discussion and analysis, recognized the favorable conditions for realizing wind power, and understood that in the current situation of insufficient machinery, only by realizing wind power can the role of mechanized wells be brought into play, and at the same time, it is in line with the spirit of more, faster, better, and more economical. Through debate, we overcame various ideological obstacles such as solely relying on machines, fearing that wind-powered waterwheels would not work, and wasting labor and materials. At the same time, in order to set an example and promote it comprehensively, the Prefectural Party Committee also promptly summarized and promoted the advanced experience of Gaomi County in realizing wind power. Each county also held on-site meetings many times to summarize and promote typical examples, thereby rapidly developing this work.
    In order to solve technical difficulties, on the one hand, we held on-site meetings to train a large number of technicians using the method of learning while doing, and mobilized the masses to start a technical revolution together. On the other hand, we used the method of sending out and inviting in, and apprentices learning from masters, to learn a large amount of foreign experience. Gaomi County alone sent people to visit and study in other places more than 30 times, and invited teachers from Dongtai County, Jiangsu, and other counties to help. Dong Xinfeng and Dong Haifeng, brothers from Weizi Commune in Changi County, through hard work and research, created a waterwheel with automatic orientation and multi-faceted wind utilization. This waterwheel can rotate with a slight breeze and can lift 14 to 30 cubic meters of water per hour. If it runs day and night, it can irrigate 6 to 11 mu of land.
    The biggest difficulty encountered in the process of realizing wind power was the shortage of materials, but relying on the masses' self-reliance, this problem was completely solved. The enthusiasm of the broad masses of commune members in all people's communes to invest materials and tap potential greatly exceeded the expectations of the vast number of cadres. At the beginning, some cadres were still afraid of difficulties, but as soon as they came into contact with the masses, all kinds of difficulties were easily solved. The most fundamental reason is that the masses are enthusiastically looking forward to the realization of wind power for water lifting.
    Now, in order to better use and protect wind-powered waterwheels, all people's communes in the Changwei area have assigned dedicated personnel to manage and use them, and have established management, usage, and maintenance systems. When they are not in use or encounter strong winds and rainstorms, the wind canopies are removed to avoid damage. The workers who manufacture the wind-powered vehicles also frequently go to the construction sites to inspect and repair them, so that they can play a greater role.

    提水风力化
    中共昌潍地委副书记　魏坚毅
    山东省昌潍专区在去冬大干四十天实现机井化的基础上，今春全党全民又经过两个月的奋战，使全区实现了提水工具风力化。我们认为利用风力提水灌溉是补救当前排灌机械缺乏和劳畜力不足的良好途径。昌潍专区共制造和仿造了自动定向式、水平转盘式、立式转盘定向式、纺车式、卧式风动机、风力手摇结合风动机等六种风力水车八万五千九百多部。现在已安装的四万多部，已经过冬灌春灌的长期考验。这些水车一般有三级左右的风力，就可自动旋转。一部水车每昼夜可浇地六亩，能顶一般人畜力水车三部，共可节省劳力十二万个，畜力十二万头。其中特别是自动定向式、立式转盘定向式和风力手摇结合风动机等三种风车，转速快、提水量大、造价低、构造简便、坚固耐用，风大风小都能使用。寿光县为了更好地发挥风力车的效益，已在所有机井旁修了水库，有风蓄下水，无风变自流，经过日晒还可以把阴水变成阳水，以利灌溉。
    风力化的实现，使全区生产战线上起了巨大的变化。今春不仅及时地让小麦喝足了返青水、拔节水，而且腾出大批劳畜力加强了精耕细作和沤制肥料。群众赞扬风力水车道：万顷碧绿丰产麦，不用劳力把水浇，只要风婆一声喊，井下泉水滚滚来。
    全区实现提水工具风力化，并不是一帆风顺的，而是经过了两种思想的激烈斗争。当地委提出大干两个月实现提水工具风力化的号召后，在干部和群众中，曾经遇到了形形色色的右倾保守思想。因此我们专门组织了一场大辩论，使大家经过讨论分析了实现风力化的有利条件，认识了在目前机械不足的情况下，只有实现风力化，才能发挥机井的作用，同时也合乎多快好省的精神。通过辩论，克服了单纯依靠机器，怕风力水车不管用，费工费料等各种思想阻力。同时为了作出样子，以点带面，全面推开。地委又及时总结推广了高密县实现风力化的先进经验。各县也多次召开现场会议，总结推广典型，从而使这一工作迅速地开展起来。
    为了解决技术上的困难，我们一方面召开现场会用边干边学的方法训练了大批技术人员，发动群众一齐动手大闹技术革命，一方面又用派出去请进来、师傅带徒弟的办法，学习了大量的外地经验。仅高密县即先后派人到外地参观学习三十多人次，并从江苏东台等县请来老师帮助。昌邑县围子公社社员董新丰董海丰弟兄二人，经过刻苦钻研，创造了自动定向、多面用风的水车，这种水车有微风即能转动，一小时可提水十四公方到三十公方，如果昼夜不停，可浇地六亩到十一亩。
    在实现风力化的过程中，遇到最大的困难是物料不足，但是依靠群众自力更生，这个问题全部解决了。各人民公社的广大社员，投物料挖潜力的热情大大出乎广大干部的意料；开始还有些干部畏难，但是一和群众接触，千难万难都迎刃而解。最根本的原因是：群众对于实现提水风力化是热心盼望的。
    现在，昌潍地区各人民公社，为了更好的运用和保护风力水车，都固定专人管理使用，建立了保管使用和检修制度，在不使用或遇有狂风骤雨时，都把风篷摘下以免损坏。制造风车的工人，也时常到工地上进行检查修理，使它发挥更大的效益。
