Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, 14th: Xu Xuehui, a female accountant at the Nongba branch of the People's Bank of China in Ruili County, Yunnan Province, near the border, fought bravely with six Kuomintang remnant bandits who crossed the border illegally in an attempt to rob the bank. Despite sustaining eight serious injuries, she successfully protected state property. The All-China Women's Federation, the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, and Cao Juru, the President of the People's Bank of China, recently sent telegrams to Xu Xuehui expressing their sincere condolences and praising her communist spirit of loyalty to the people and selflessness, considering her a role model for women, youth, and financial and trade workers across the country.

The incident occurred at four o'clock in the morning on March 3rd this year. Six bandits who had illegally crossed the border quietly pried open the door of the Nongba branch of the People's Bank of China, shining flashlights around in an attempt to rob it. At that time, Xu Xuehui was the only person sleeping in the branch. She was awakened by the sound of the door being pried open and the flashlight beams. Although Xu Xuehui was outnumbered and unarmed, she was fearless in protecting state property. She fought the armed bandits with all her strength while loudly calling for help to catch the bandits. To prevent her from shouting, the enemy slashed at her mouth with a knife, causing a serious injury to her face from her mouth to her ear. However, after regaining consciousness, she continued to fight bravely with the bandits, trying to seize a money box containing 50,000 yuan that was next to the bed. The bandits then cut off both of her hands with a knife and inflicted several more cuts on her back, chest, and legs. Despite her serious injuries, she struggled to get up and shouted, "Come quickly, the bandits have taken the money box!"

As several bandits carried the money box out of the branch entrance, Wang Tianlin, a cadre of the National Trade Company and a demobilized soldier, who was sleeping not far from the branch, was awakened by Xu Xuehui's cries for help. He immediately grabbed his gun and rushed over, shooting and killing one of the bandits carrying the box. The other bandits fled in panic, and Wang Tianlin recovered the money box. By the time other comrades nearby arrived at the branch, Xu Xuehui had already fallen into a pool of blood. When she regained consciousness, the first thing she asked anxiously was, "Is the money box still there?"

After the incident, leading cadres from the Yunnan Provincial Party Committee, the Dehong Dai and Jingpo Autonomous Prefecture Party Committee, the Ruili County Party Committee, and many units of the People's Bank of China immediately did everything possible to rescue her life, which was in critical condition. They sent a special car to take her from Nongba to Ruili Hospital for emergency treatment, and then sent someone from Ruili to escort her to the Prefecture People's Hospital in Luxi. On March 6th, the Prefecture Party Committee and the Provincial Party Committee inspection team sent a special plane from Baoshan to take her to Kunming Hospital for emergency treatment. Under the loving care of the Party and the meticulous care of medical personnel, Xu Xuehui is now out of danger, and her injuries have greatly improved.

The Yunnan Provincial People's Committee recently issued a circular commending Xu Xuehui, stating that she is a good daughter of the country and a model cadre. The Yunnan Provincial Committee of the Communist Youth League made a decision to award Xu Xuehui the honorary title of "Youth Activist in Socialist Construction" of Yunnan Province. The Ruili County Committee of the Communist Youth League, based on Xu Xuehui's application before her injury, has approved her membership in the Communist Youth League.

Xu Xuehui is from Tengchong County, Yunnan Province, and was born into a family of handicraft workers. She is not yet eighteen years old this year. (Attached picture)

    赤手空拳同匪徒搏斗保卫国家财产
    女会计员徐学惠树立光辉榜样
    全国妇联团中央人民银行打电报表扬慰问
    新华社昆明14日电　云南省靠近国境的瑞丽县人民银行弄巴营业所女会计员徐学惠，赤手空拳同六个偷越国境企图抢劫的国民党残匪英勇搏斗，身负八处重伤，终于保住了国家的财产。全国妇女联合会、共青团中央委员会和中国人民银行总行行长曹菊如，最近分别打电报给徐学惠表示亲切慰问，并表扬她忠于人民、舍己为公的共产主义品德，认为她是全国妇女、青年和财贸工作者学习的榜样。
    事情发生在今年3月3日凌晨四点钟。六个偷越国境的匪徒悄悄地撬开了人民银行弄巴营业所的门，用手电四处照射，企图抢劫。当时睡在营业所里只有徐学惠一个人，她被撬门声和手电光惊醒了。徐学惠虽然以寡敌众，手无寸铁，但是她为了保护国家财产，毫无畏惧，一面用尽全身力气同武装匪徒搏斗，一面高声呼唤来人捉匪。敌人为了不让她叫喊，就用刀向她的嘴巴砍去，从嘴巴到耳边的面颊，被砍成重伤，但是她苏醒过来后，仍奋不顾身地同匪徒抢夺在床边的一只装着五万元的钱箱，这时匪徒竟用刀把她两只手砍断，又在她背上、胸部、腿上砍了几刀，这时她受到重伤，她仍顽强地挣扎起来呼喊着：“快来人，匪徒把钱箱抢走了！”
    当几个匪徒扛着钱箱走出营业所门口时，睡在离营业所不远的民族贸易公司干部、复员军人王天林，已被徐学惠的呼喊声惊醒，马上拿枪赶去，一枪就打死了一个扛箱子的匪徒，另外几个匪徒慌张地逃走了，王天林夺回了钱箱。等到附近的其他同志闻声赶到营业所时，徐学惠已倒在血泊里，当她苏醒过来时，第一句话就急切地问：“钱箱还在不在？”
    事情发生后，中共云南省委、德宏傣族景颇族自治州委、瑞丽县委以及人民银行等许多单位的领导干部，马上尽力设法抢救她垂危的生命，派了专车把她从弄巴接到瑞丽医院急救，又从瑞丽派人护送到潞西的州人民医院抢救。3月6日，州委和省委检查团又派专人从保山用飞机把她送到昆明医院急救。徐学惠在党的亲切关怀下和医务人员细心护理下，现在已经脱离了危险期，伤势也已经大为好转。
    云南省人民委员会不久前通令嘉奖徐学惠，指出她是国家的好女儿，是个模范干部。共青团云南省委作出决定，授予徐学惠为云南省社会主义建设青年积极分子的光荣称号，共青团瑞丽县委根据徐学惠在受伤前的申请，已批准她为共青团员。
    徐学惠是云南省腾冲县人，出生在一个手工业工人的家庭里，今年还不满十八岁。（附图片）
