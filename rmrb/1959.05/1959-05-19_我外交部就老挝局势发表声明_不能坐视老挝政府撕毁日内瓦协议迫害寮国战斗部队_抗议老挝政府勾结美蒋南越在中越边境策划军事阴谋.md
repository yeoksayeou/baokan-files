Xinhua News Agency, May 18th: Statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China
May 18, 1959

    The Lao Royal Government, on May 16, 1959, claimed that it had ordered two battalions of the former Pathet Lao Fighting Units to surrender their weapons within twenty-four hours on May 11, or they would be charged with rebellion. At the same time, the leaders of the former Pathet Lao Fighting Units, including Prince Souphanouvong, have been under close surveillance and house arrest by the Royal Government's military police. This is a more serious act by the Lao Royal Government, following its public declaration on February 11 this year to unilaterally abandon the Geneva Accords on Laos, and a complete tearing up of the Geneva Accords. This is also part of the entire conspiracy of U.S. imperialism to create tension in Southeast Asia and carry out aggression against Indochina. The Government of the People's Republic of China cannot but express its serious protest and condemnation.

    The Sananikone government of Laos, under the direct instigation and support of the United States, on the one hand, is undermining the Geneva Accords, opposing the Lao International Supervisory and Control Commission from continuing to carry out its tasks, abandoning the agreements it signed with the former Pathet Lao Fighting Units, and constantly persecuting and attempting to eliminate the former Pathet Lao Fighting Units and their leaders; on the other hand, it is introducing large numbers of U.S. military personnel and weapons and ammunition, colluding with the remnant armed forces of the Chiang Kai-shek clique and the South Vietnamese Ngo Dinh Diem clique, plotting military conspiracies and carrying out armed provocations in the border areas of Laos bordering China and Vietnam. It is clear that the aim of the United States and the Lao authorities is to drag Laos into the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc and turn Laos into a U.S. military base. All these actions by the Lao Royal Government have created an extremely dangerous situation in Laos and Indochina.

    The measures now taken by the Lao Royal Government against the former Pathet Lao Fighting Units are, in effect, openly launching a civil war within Laos, and further undermining peace in Indochina and exacerbating tensions in the Southeast Asian region. If the Lao authorities do not quickly come to their senses, not only will Laos be plunged into the vortex of civil war, but the peace of Indochina will also be seriously threatened. Therefore, all countries and peoples who care about and safeguard peace in Southeast Asia should rise up to resolutely oppose and stop the Lao Royal Government, under the instigation of the United States, from abandoning the Geneva Accords and creating civil war in Laos.

    The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China solemnly declares that, as a participant in the Geneva Conference on the Indochina issue and a guarantor of the Geneva Accords, and as a close neighbor of the Kingdom of Laos, China naturally cannot sit idly by as the Lao Royal Government completely abandons the Geneva Accords and endangers peace in Indochina. The Chinese government believes it is necessary to solemnly point out that the Geneva Accords must be observed, and the Lao Royal Government's actions of undermining the Geneva Accords and persecuting the former Pathet Lao Fighting Units to provoke civil war in Laos must be stopped immediately, otherwise it will bear all the serious consequences arising therefrom.

    Xinhua News Agency, May 18th: According to a broadcast from Vientiane Radio on the 16th, on May 11, the Lao Royal authorities, under the instigation of the United States, on the pretext of so-called "crimes" such as the two battalions of the Pathet Lao Fighting Units incorporated into the Royal Army "not accepting military ranks" and "opposing superior commanders," ordered these two battalions to surrender their weapons within twenty-four hours, otherwise they would be "punished as rebels." At the same time, the Royal Army and police also surrounded the residences of Prince Souphanouvong, leader of the former Pathet Lao Fighting Units, and many members of parliament, and arrested a large number of members of the Patriotic Party. Thus, the Lao Royal side has completely torn up the agreements reached with the Pathet Lao Fighting Units on December 28, 1956, and November 2, 1957, regarding the participation of the Pathet Lao Fighting Units in national common life, and has also completely torn up the 1954 Geneva Accords on Laos.

    Regarding the issue of granting military ranks to the two battalions of the former Pathet Lao Fighting Units incorporated into the Royal Army, according to a disclosure in the "Lao Patriotic News" on February 14, "The Royal Government does not incorporate all the officers and soldiers of the former Pathet Lao Fighting Units as a whole into the army, but only incorporates a small number of them, and expels the rest from the army. The officers and soldiers who are incorporated into the army, whether they agree or not, are all demoted by one rank. Those who are unwilling to accept the new rank will be disbanded by the Royal Army." Colonel Singkapo, who was in charge of these two battalions on the Pathet Lao Fighting Units side, stated in January that it was inappropriate to grant him alone the rank of colonel without granting ranks to the other officers and soldiers of these two battalions, because he "is an indivisible part of the one thousand five hundred soldiers and officers incorporated into the Royal Army in accordance with the agreement." "If I accept this rank immediately, other soldiers and officers will express suspicion and dissatisfaction, which will damage national unity and harmony."

    It is reported that it is not accidental that the Royal side wants to launch armed persecution against the Pathet Lao Fighting Units at this time. Since Pei Sananikone announced the abandonment of the Geneva Accords on February 11 this year, the United States has been planning this conspiracy behind the scenes, and finally launched this incident. While launching this conspiracy, the United States established a military base in Lower Laos to threaten the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and directed Laos to collude with and support the remnants of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits hiding in the Lao territory bordering China to harass the Chinese border.

    The above signs indicate that the Lao Royal Government's action is part of a conspiracy to launch a large-scale military coup, attempting to launch a full-scale attack on the Lao Patriotic Party after eliminating these two battalions, close the "Patriotic News," declare the Patriotic Party illegal, and carry out large-scale arrests and killings. According to a spokesman for the Lao Royal Government, not only in Vientiane, but also the leaders of the former Pathet Lao Fighting Units throughout the country have been placed under the "guardianship" of the Royal Army and police.

    我外交部就老挝局势发表声明
    不能坐视老挝政府撕毁日内瓦协议迫害寮国战斗部队
    抗议老挝政府勾结美蒋南越在中越边境策划军事阴谋
    新华社18日讯　中华人民共和国外交部声明
                                  1959年5月18日
    老挝王国政府1959年5月16日声称，它已于5月11日下令前寮国战斗部队两个营在二十四小时内交出武器，否则即按叛乱论罪。与此同时，前寮国战斗部队的领导人，包括苏发努冯亲王在内，已处于王国政府军警的严密监视和软禁之下。这是老挝王国政府，继今年2月11日公开声明片面废弃关于老挝的日内瓦协议后，彻底撕毁日内瓦协议的更为严重的行为。这也是美帝国主义在东南亚制造紧张局势和对印度支那进行侵略的整个阴谋的一部分。中华人民共和国政府不能不对此表示严重的抗议和谴责。
    老挝的萨纳尼空政府，在美国的直接唆使和支持下，一方面，破坏日内瓦协议，反对老挝国际监察和监督委员会继续执行其任务，废弃它同前寮国战斗部队所签订的各项协议，不断迫害和企图消灭前寮国战斗部队及其领导人员；另一方面，引进大批美国军事人员和武器弹药，勾结蒋介石集团残余武装和南越吴庭艳集团，在老挝同中国、越南接壤的边境地带策划军事阴谋和进行武装挑衅。很明显，美国和老挝当局的目的，就是要把老挝拉入东南亚侵略集团，变老挝为美国的军事基地。老挝王国政府的所有这些行为，已经在老挝和印度支那造成了极端危险的局势。
    老挝王国政府现在对前寮国战斗部队所采取的措施，实际上就是在老挝境内公然发动内战，并进而破坏印度支那的和平和加剧东南亚地区的紧张局势。如果老挝当局不迅速悬崖勒马，不但老挝将陷入内战的漩涡，而且印度支那的和平也必将受到严重的威胁。因此，一切关心和维护东南亚和平的国家和人民，应当起来坚决反对和制止在美国策动下的老挝王国政府毁弃日内瓦协议和在老挝制造内战的行为。
    中华人民共和国外交部郑重声明，作为有关印度支那问题的日内瓦会议的参加国和日内瓦协议的保证国，作为老挝王国的紧邻，中国对老挝王国政府彻底毁弃日内瓦协议和危及印度支那和平的严重行为自然不能坐视。中国政府认为有必要严正指出，日内瓦协议必须得到遵守，老挝王国政府破坏日内瓦协议和迫害前寮国战斗部队以挑起老挝内战的行为必须立即停止，否则它就要承担由此而引起的一切严重后果。
    新华社18日讯　据万象电台16日广播，5月11日，老挝王国当局在美国的唆使下，借口所谓寮国战斗部队方面并入王国的两个营“不接受军衔”、“反对上级指挥官”等“罪名”，下令这两个营于二十四小时内缴械投降，否则就要“按叛乱罪论处”。与此同时，王国军队和警察还包围了前寮国战斗部队的领袖苏发努冯亲王和许多议员的住宅，并逮捕了大批爱国党党员。至此，老挝王国方面已经彻底撕毁了1956年12月28日和1957年11月2日它同寮国战斗部队达成的关于寮国战斗部队参加国家共同生活的协议，也彻底撕毁了1954年关于老挝的日内瓦协议。
    关于授予并入王国军队的前寮国战斗部队的两个营以军衔的问题，据“老挝爱国报”2月14日揭露说，“王国政府不把前寮国战斗部队的所有官兵作为一个整体并入军队，而只把他们中间少数一些人并入，把其余的人逐出军队。被并入军队的官兵不论他们同意不同意，军衔一律降一级。不愿接受新军衔的人，王国军队将加以解散。”负责这两个营的寮国战斗部队方面的辛卡波上校曾于1月间声明，只授给他一人上校军衔而不授给这两个营的其他军官和士兵军衔的做法是不合适的，因为他“是按协议并入王国军队的一千五百名士兵和军官中的不可分割的一部分”。“如果我马上接受这个军衔，其他士兵和军官就会表示怀疑和不满，这样会损害民族的团结和和睦。”
    据悉，王国方面所以要在这个时候对寮国战斗部队发动武装迫害并不是偶然的。自今年2月11日培·萨纳尼空宣布毁弃日内瓦协议以来，美国一直在幕后策划这一阴谋，最后终于发动了此次事变。在发动这一阴谋的时候，美国在下寮建立了军事基地威胁越南民主共和国，指使老挝勾结并支持隐藏在临近中国的老挝境内的蒋介石残匪侵扰中国边境。
    以上迹象表明，老挝王国政府这一行动乃是它企图发动一个大规模军事政变的阴谋的一部分，它企图在消灭这两个营以后，对老挝爱国党全面进攻，封闭“爱国报”，宣布爱国党为非法，并进行大捕大杀。据老挝王国一位发言人透露，不仅在万象，而且在全国各地的前寮国战斗部队的领导人也已置于王国军警的“看守”之下。
