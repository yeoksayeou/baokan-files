    Grasping the backward and catching up with the advanced

    Grasping the key points and driving the general, is a well-known and effective working method and leadership method. However, in the specific application of this working method, there are several different aspects: grasping the advanced and leading the backward is one aspect of the specific application of this method, grasping the backward and catching up with the advanced is another aspect of the specific application of this method, and grasping the middle and leading both ends is yet another aspect of the specific application of this method. These aspects can be used in parallel in work, or emphasis can be placed on one aspect in different regions and at different times. In short, the purpose is to promote the rapid development of revolutionary work and production.

    The existence of differences between advanced, intermediate, and backward in various movements is a universal law of the development of things, and not a temporary phenomenon in one place. Backwardness and progress are two contradictory aspects, which are interdependent and transform into each other under certain conditions. Progress and backwardness come from comparison; without backwardness, there would be no progress, and similarly, without progress, there would be no backwardness. Under certain conditions, backwardness can be transformed into progress, and progress can also be transformed into backwardness. This situation can often be seen in our actual work. The process of mutual transformation between progress and backwardness is actually the process of the development of things. Therefore, we say that the contradiction between progress and backwardness is a law-governed manifestation of the development of things and will always exist.

    Saying this, some people may ask, since progress and backwardness are an objective law of the development of things, why bother grasping backwardness? This view is obviously incorrect. Because although the development of things proceeds according to objective laws, the role of objective laws in social life is realized through people's practical activities. At the same time, although the contradiction between progress and backwardness is constantly struggling, transforming, and developing, it also has a certain stability within a certain period of time. Our task is to promote changes in the distinction between progress and backwardness on the basis of revolutionary work and production development, so that the advanced become more advanced, and the backward catch up with the advanced. To give an example: for an advanced village with a yield of 500 catties of grain per mu and a backward village with a yield of 100 catties per mu, we cannot be satisfied with the distinction between 500 catties per mu and 100 catties per mu, but actively promote both to work hard to increase production, and change the original distinction or contradictory situation on the basis of forward development. After the distinction or contradiction between progress and backwardness within a certain period of time is resolved, a new distinction or contradiction between progress and backwardness emerges on a new basis. Each time the old distinction or contradiction is resolved, and a new distinction or contradiction appears, it means that the work has moved forward one step. Therefore, acknowledging that the distinction or contradiction between progress and backwardness is an objective law of the development of things should never lead to neglecting to grasp this law.

    Some people believe that the backward are a minority, and grasping them or not will not affect the overall situation. It is true that the backward are always a minority, but we cannot ignore grasping them just because they are a minority. Everyone knows that the advanced are also a minority! Why are people so attentive to them? Some people may say that grasping the advanced is to learn from experience and guide the work, but what can be grasped from the backward? This understanding is not comprehensive. Grasping the advanced can absorb experience, and grasping the backward can also absorb experience. Only grasping the advanced, and only finding experience from the advanced part, often cannot solve the specific problems of the backward part well, and it is not easy to form a situation where the intermediate part is followed and promoted forward. Grasping both ends and leading the middle is a very good leadership method, and grasping only the advanced inevitably has one-sidedness. As a leader, if you want to achieve comprehensive and correct leadership, you must not only learn to be good at grasping the advanced, but also learn to be good at grasping the backward. Only in this way can we grasp the overall situation, form a comprehensive understanding, obtain more comprehensive experience, avoid subjectivism and generalized leadership methods, and promote the comprehensive development of work. If we only pay attention to grasping the advanced and ignore grasping the backward, it will cause one-sidedness in leadership work, and in the final analysis, it will be divorced from the broad masses of the people.

### 抓落后赶先进

    抓落后赶先进
    抓住重点，带动一般，是大家所熟悉的，而且是行之有效的一种工作方法和领导方法。但是，在工作中具体运用这种工作方法的时候，则有几个不同的方面：抓先进、带落后是具体运用这种方法的一个方面，抓落后、赶先进是具体运用这种方法的另一个方面，抓中间、带两头是具体运用这种方法的又一个方面。这几个方面在工作中可以并用，也可以在不同地区、不同时间之内侧重于一个方面。总之，其目的都是为了推动革命工作和生产的迅速发展。
    在各种运动中，存在着先进、中间和落后的差别，是事物发展的一个普遍的规律，不是一时一地的暂时现象。落后和先进是一对矛盾的两个方面，二者是相互依存而在一定条件下又相互转化的。先进和落后是从比较中来的，没有落后就显不出先进，同样，没有先进也就无所谓落后。在一定条件下，落后可以转化为先进，先进也可以转化为落后，这种情况在我们的实际工作中是经常可以看到的。先进和落后的相互转化的过程，实际上就是事物发展的过程。因此，我们说先进和落后的矛盾，是事物发展的一种规律性的表现，是永远存在的。
    这样说，可能有人会问，既然先进和落后是事物发展的一条客观规律，那么对落后还抓它干什么呢？这种看法显然是不对的。因为事物的发展虽然是按照客观规律进行的，但是在社会生活中客观规律的作用是通过人们的实践活动而实现的。同时，先进和落后的矛盾虽然在不断的斗争、转化和发展，但是在一定时间内又具有一定的稳定性。我们的任务是：在革命工作和生产发展的基础上促使先进和落后的区别发生变化，让先进的更先进，落后的赶先进。打个比方来说：对于亩产五百斤粮食的先进村和亩产一百斤的落后村，我们既不能满足亩产五百斤和亩产一百斤这种区别的状况，而是积极促进两者都努力提高产量，在向前发展的基础上改变原来的区别或矛盾的状况。一定时间之内的先进和落后的区别或矛盾解决之后，紧接着就又出现了在新的基础之上的先进和落后的区别或矛盾。每次旧的区别或矛盾的解决，新的区别或矛盾的出现，都意味着工作向前发展了一步。因此，承认先进和落后的区别或矛盾是事物发展的客观规律，决不应当忽视掌握这种规律。
    有些人认为，落后的是少数，抓不抓影响不了大局。诚然，落后的总是少数，但是不能因为是少数而不注意去抓。大家知道，先进的也是少数呀！为什么人们就很注意呢？有人可能说，抓先进是为了吸取经验，指导工作，抓落后能抓到什么呢？这种认识是不全面的，抓先进能够吸取经验，抓落后也能吸取经验。单抓先进，单从先进部分中找经验，往往不能很好地解决落后部分的具体问题，而且对于中间部分也不容易形成前呼后拥、连带带推的形势，促使它向前发展。抓两头、带中间是一个很好的领导方法，单抓先进就难免有片面性。作为一个领导者，要想实现全面的、正确的领导，就不仅要学会善于抓先进，而且要学会善于抓落后。只有如此才能掌握全面情况，形成全面的认识，取得比较全面的经验，避免主观主义和一般化的领导方法，促进工作的全面发展。如果只注意抓先进而忽视抓落后，就会使领导工作产生片面性，归根结底，就会脱离广大群众。
