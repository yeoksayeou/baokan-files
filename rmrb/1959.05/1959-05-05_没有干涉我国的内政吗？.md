Isn't This Interference in Our Internal Affairs?

    After reading Indian Prime Minister Nehru's speech to the Indian People's Assembly on April 27 concerning the situation in Tibet, China, I found many things in it difficult to understand.

    Mr. Nehru said, "We have no desire whatsoever to interfere in Tibet." That should be the case, because Tibet is our Chinese territory, and the affairs of Tibet are our internal affairs. Anyone who interferes in Tibet is interfering in our internal affairs! The people of China and India have always had a long history of friendly relations and jointly advocated the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. India should not interfere in our internal affairs at all.

    However, Prime Minister Nehru is not as he says and as we imagine him to be.

    As everyone knows, after our People's Liberation Army quelled the rebellion in Tibet, more than one million people in Tibet applauded and rejoiced, saying they had "cleared away the dark clouds and seen the blue sky." From then on, the Tibetan people embarked on the broad road of socialism. A new page has been turned in the history of Tibet. What a joyous thing this is! But Mr. Nehru insists on calling this a "tragedy." That small handful of reactionary elements in the upper strata of Tibet used savage means such as gouging out eyes and cutting off noses to harm the people, attempting to keep the Tibetan people forever gasping for breath under the dark serf system. May I ask Prime Minister Nehru, is this what you call a "comedy"?

    Prime Minister Nehru also spoke of some kind of "strong nationalistic sentiment." But do a small handful of reactionary elements in the upper strata represent the Tibetan nationality? Or do the more than 1.1 million people of Tibet represent the Tibetan nationality? Is it national sentiment for a small handful of reactionary elements in the upper strata to hate the people and betray the motherland? Or is it national sentiment for the more than 1.1 million Tibetan compatriots to resolutely take the road of socialism? If we are talking about the Tibetan people having strong nationalistic sentiment, they certainly do, they have the strong nationalistic sentiment of the Chinese nation; they are proud and feel honored to be members of the Chinese nation. My Tibetan compatriots are now rejoicing, full of spirit, and full of energy, striving to build a new socialist Tibet that is equal, free, happy, prosperous, and strong. This is the real national sentiment, and Mr. Nehru should see this.

    Prime Minister Nehru repeatedly said that he does not want to interfere in our internal affairs. However, Indian diplomatic personnel are distributing the so-called "Statement of the Dalai Lama" that slanders our country; Indian police are condoning thugs who insult the images of our great leaders; and some Indian politicians and newspapers have published many slanderous and interfering statements about our internal affairs. Mr. Nehru calls all this "not essentially political" and "primarily a sympathy based on emotional and humanitarian reasons." Prime Minister, please listen: "Tibetan independence," "the Tibetan issue is not China's internal affair," "India can no longer remain silent on the Tibetan issue," etc. Is this "not essentially political"?

    When our people's representatives issued a solemn warning to Indian interventionists on behalf of the 650 million people at the National People's Congress, and made a stern counterattack against those Indian words and deeds that interfered in our internal affairs and slandered our country, Mr. Nehru then said that we "disregarded the truth and etiquette, and used the language of the Cold War." This is too unreasonable. It is not permissible for others to speak when interfering in their internal affairs; it is not permissible for others to counterattack when slandering their country. If others speak and counterattack, they are disregarding etiquette. What kind of logic is this? May I ask Mr. Nehru, is it we who disregard the truth? Or is it the Prime Minister and some Indian interventionists who disregard the truth? Is it we who disregard etiquette? Or is it the Indian interventionists who disregard etiquette? Is it China that has interfered in India's internal affairs? Or is it India that has interfered in China's internal affairs?

    Our counterattack against the interventionists is "the language of the Cold War," while the Indian interventionists are shouting things like "India cannot remain silent," inciting the Indian people by saying "China is launching a war against India," etc. What kind of language is this then?

    I hope Prime Minister Nehru thinks about this: who benefits from what the Prime Minister is doing? Besides benefiting imperialism, what good does it do for India or Asia?

### 没有干涉我国的内政吗？

    没有干涉我国的内政吗？
    我读了印度总理尼赫鲁4月27日在印度人民院就我国西藏局势问题发表的讲话以后，感到其中很多话实在不能让人理解。
    尼赫鲁先生说，“我们一点也不想干涉西藏”。应该这样，因为西藏是我们中国的领土，西藏的事情是我们中国的内政。谁要干涉西藏谁就是干涉我国的内政！中印两国人民历来就有着悠久的友好关系，又共同倡议了五项原则。印度根本就不应当干涉我国的内政。
    然而，尼赫鲁总理并不是像自己所说的和我们所想像的那样。
    谁都知道，当我人民解放军平息了西藏叛乱以后，西藏一百多万人民拍手称快，个个笑逐颜开，他们说是“拨开了乌云见青天”。从此西藏人民走上了社会主义的康庄大道。西藏的历史掀开了新的一页。这是多么可喜的事情啊！可是尼赫鲁先生，硬把这说成是“悲剧”。西藏那一小撮上层反动分子，用挖眼睛、削鼻子等等残害人民的野蛮手段，企图让西藏人民永远喘息在黑暗的农奴制度下。请问尼赫鲁总理，这难道叫“喜剧”吗？
    尼赫鲁总理还谈到什么“强烈的民族主义情绪”。但是，是一小撮上层反动分子代表西藏民族呢？还是西藏一百一十多万人民代表西藏民族？是一小撮上层反动分子，仇视人民、背叛祖国是民族情绪呢？还是西藏一百一十多万藏胞坚决地走社会主义的道路是民族情绪？要说西藏人民有着强烈的民族情绪，确是有，他们有的是中华民族的强烈的民族情绪，他们为自己是中华民族的一员，而感到骄傲、自豪。我西藏同胞，现在正在欢欣鼓舞，精神百倍，干劲十足地为建设平等、自由、幸福、富强的社会主义的新西藏而斗争。这是真正的民族情绪，尼赫鲁先生应当看到这一点。
    尼赫鲁总理口口声声地说，不想干涉我国内政。可是，印度的外交人员却散发诽谤我国的所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”；印度的警察纵容暴徒侮辱我国的伟大的领袖像，印度一些政界人士和报刊发表了许多对我国内政的诽谤性和干涉性的言论。这一切，尼赫鲁都说成是“实质上不是政治性的”，“主要是一种基于情感和人道原因的同情”，总理先生请听，“西藏独立”，“西藏问题不是中国的内政”，“对西藏问题印度不能再沉默了”，等等，这难道是“实质上不是政治性的”？
    当我人民代表在人代大会上代表六亿五千万人民向印度干涉者发出庄严的警告，对印度那些干涉我国内政和诽谤我国的言行，进行了严正的反击时，尼赫鲁先生却又来说我们“不顾事实真相和礼节，使用了冷战的语言”。这就太不讲道理了。干涉人家的内政，不许人家说话；诽谤人家国家，不许人家反击。人家要是说话和反击就是不顾礼节。这是什么逻辑？请问尼赫鲁先生，是我们不顾事实的真相呢？还是总理先生和印度的一些干涉者们不顾事实的真相呢？是我们不顾礼节呢？还是印度的干涉者不顾礼节？是我们中国干涉了印度的内政呢？还是印度干涉了中国的内政？
    我们反击干涉者是“冷战的语言”，印度的干涉者，叫嚷什么“印度不能沉默了”，煽动印度人民说什么“中国对印度发动战争”，等等，这又叫什么语言呢？
    我希望尼赫鲁总理想想，总理先生这样做对谁有利？除去对帝国主义有利之外，对印度，对亚洲有什么好处？　北京市一二八中　王振奎
