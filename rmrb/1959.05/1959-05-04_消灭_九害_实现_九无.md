Comrade Luo Wencai, representative, discusses the pest elimination and disease prevention situation in Guangmu Management Area, Xuyong County:

    Before Liberation: Mosquitoes, flies, lice, and fleas were countless, the stench was unbearable, diseases were rampant year after year, and hundreds of people died, which was truly heartbreaking.
    Now: Mosquitoes and flies have disappeared, the appearance has greatly changed, the environment is as beautiful as a painting, and thousands of homes are adorned with vibrant colors.

Chairman, fellow representatives:

I fully endorse Premier Zhou's "Government Work Report" and fully agree with the reports made by Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen.

In March of this year, I inspected the Guangmu Management Area (formerly Guangmu Township) of Shuiwei Commune in Xuyong County, Sichuan Province. Now, I will talk about the "Nine Pests" elimination and hygiene practices in Guangmu Area:

Xuyong County is a remote mountainous area. Before liberation, due to the exploitation and oppression of the reactionaries, the working people lived an extremely poor and miserable life. The sanitary conditions were extremely poor, diseases were constantly prevalent throughout the year, and people were dying at any time. In 1947, when relapsing fever was rampant, as many as thirty or forty households in Guangmu, Fenshui, Jiancao and other townships were completely wiped out. Harmful beasts and birds seriously threatened the production and life of the people in the mountainous areas. After liberation, the Party and the government led the people to carry out the patriotic health campaign, and in 1952 eliminated several infectious diseases such as relapsing fever, smallpox and cholera. However, the four pests were not eradicated, and people were still seriously threatened in their production and health. Since December 1957, with the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production and the new upsurge of the national pest elimination and patriotic health campaign, the people of the whole county, under the leadership of the Party, went all out and launched a massive and vigorous mass movement to eliminate the "Nine Pests" and promote hygiene. In just over six months, they basically eliminated the nine pests, including rats, sparrows, mosquitoes, flies, lice, fleas, cockroaches, and harmful beasts. The whole county basically achieved "Nine No's"; the masses also changed their past unhygienic habits and established a new atmosphere of everyone paying attention to hygiene and loving cleanliness. In this movement, Guangmu Area won the glorious title of the first "Nine No's" area in the county.

Guangmu Area is located on the northern border of Xuyong County, and is a high and cold mountainous area in the county, stretching over a hundred miles, with an altitude of more than 2,400 meters. There are still undeveloped forests on the mountain, and there is snow cover for more than two months of the year. The whole township has only 346 households and 1,500 people, which can be considered "vast land and sparse population." Before liberation, the people in the mountainous areas were oppressed and exploited by the reactionary rule, coupled with the harm of harmful animals and birds to production and the threat of disease, the peasants often lived a hard life of "bran and vegetables for half a year, diseases and famine, no clothes or quilts in winter, and nine deaths out of ten illnesses." According to the old farmer Li Zaiyang, "In the past, there was a Lianhua embankment here, and more than 200 shi of corn were trampled and eaten by wild boars and harmful birds, resulting in no harvest. At most, more than 60 shi of land could yield more than 20 shi. The 18 shi of land rented by the poor peasant Li Huantang produced nothing because of the damage caused by harmful beasts and birds. He could not pay the landlord's rent, so the landlord deducted all three shi of grain from his "steady hand" (rent), forcing his family to wander elsewhere. In Guangmu, almost all the corn and potatoes sown every year were eaten by harmful animals and birds, and the replanting rate reached about 85%. The peasants suffered from the disasters of harmful animals and birds, and were also exploited by the landlords, so their lives were very miserable.

At that time, people lived such a miserable life that there was no question of paying attention to hygiene. There is a Dazugou (literally "big foot ditch") here, which used to be dirty and filthy, with garbage everywhere in front of and behind the houses, excrement and urine all over the ground, dirt piled up to the foot, and weeds growing everywhere. People had to hold up their arms to brush away the dew when they walked here, otherwise the dew would fall on their feet and cause "dung blisters" (skin rashes). Mosquitoes and flies swarmed, and mosquitoes and flies would hit people's faces when they walked. Diseases were often prevalent here, and many people died every year. For example, ten people in Zhou Wanjin's family of twenty died in one month, and the families of Chen Shengyang, Huang Zhijiang, Mu Shaohua and others were wiped out. At that time, such ballads were circulating:

    Guangmu Township in the high and cold mountains,
    Thorns and bushes cover the hills.
    Mosquitoes, flies, lice and fleas are countless,
    The stench is unbearable.
    Diseases are rampant year after year,
    And hundreds of people die, which is truly heartbreaking.
    The puppet government doesn't care about the suffering of the people,
    They only know how to levy money and grain!

After liberation, under the leadership of the Party, the system of private land ownership was eradicated, the level of production and life was greatly improved, sanitary conditions were changed, and the suffering of diseases was initially alleviated. However, the nine pests were not eradicated, and people were still greatly threatened in their production and health. In December 1957, the county launched a movement to eliminate the nine pests and promote hygiene. Under the leadership of the Party, Guangmu Township took active actions, adopted quick, rapid, brave, and fierce methods to encircle and suppress them, and quickly launched a upsurge to eliminate the nine pests and promote hygiene. More than 1,200 people in the township participated in the movement. After five large-scale encirclements and suppressions, the nine pests were basically eliminated in March of last year. A total of more than 242,000 sparrows and more than 129,000 rats were eliminated, as well as a large number of mosquitoes, flies, cockroaches, lice, fleas, bedbugs, etc., making every household clean and everyone pay attention to hygiene. The Dazugou, which was once filthy, has now completely changed its appearance. Now it is: "As soon as you enter Dazugou, mosquitoes and flies disappear, the indoors and outdoors are clean, the appearance is greatly different, the environment is as beautiful as a painting, and thousands of homes are adorned with vibrant colors."

Due to the victory of the movement to eliminate the nine pests and promote hygiene, the incidence and death rate of diseases have also been greatly reduced. No infectious diseases have occurred last year and this year, and the disasters of birds and beasts have also been greatly reduced. In particular, since the establishment of the People's Commune last year, sanitation work has been done better, and people's enthusiasm for production has become even greater. Guangmu Township had a bumper harvest of grain last year, and now they sing: "Diseases are eliminated and pests are eradicated, we work busily on production, and leaps forward bloom like fragrant flowers. The People's Commune is truly good, and the commune members are happy with increased production."

The great achievements of Guangmu Area's sanitation work are mainly due to the following reasons:

First, the Party has strengthened its leadership. The Party branch carefully studied the instructions from higher authorities and made unified arrangements. The leaders took the lead themselves, using practical actions to motivate the masses, and carried out the pest elimination work in depth. Several township cadres brought pest elimination tools with them every time they went to the countryside, checking production and also checking sanitation, eliminating the four pests when they saw them, cleaning up wherever they saw dirt, and helping the masses to pour out urine buckets, move urine buckets, and educating the masses to change the past bad habits of placing urine buckets at the head of the bed, filling the room with stench. In the large-scale encirclement and suppression, the Party and Youth League branch secretaries personally carried dry food and led assault teams to the deep ditches and high mountains stretching over a hundred miles to hunt down harmful beasts and birds, which greatly encouraged the masses' determination to eliminate pests.

Second, superstitions were broken, minds were liberated, and the principle of "if you don't understand, debate; if you don't believe, look" was practiced. Because the people in the mountainous areas were oppressed in the past and lacked cultural and scientific knowledge, many people did not believe that the nine pests could be completely eliminated, and some even thought that eliminating the nine pests would harm life. In response to these ideas, we calculated detailed accounts, dug up the roots, held physical exhibitions, and conducted education through living people and real events. We collected mosquito nets, quilts, clothes, and furniture that had been damaged by rats, as well as grain that had been dug out of rat holes and grain dissected from sparrow bellies, organized exhibitions, and invited people who had suffered the most from the harm of rats, sparrows, and diseases to speak out at the meeting. After the education and enlightenment of facts, the masses took active actions.

Third, we closely combined pest elimination with production, with production as the center, and insisted on eliminating the nine pests. The commune members earnestly implemented the county party committee's proposal of "doing a big job when busy, doing a small job, encircling and suppressing when there is time, preparing when there is no time, and making a sudden attack when there is time," so that the movement was both a blitzkrieg and could be regularized. Commune members brought pest elimination tools with them when they went to the mountains for production. For example, Li Zaiyang, who is sixty-five years old, also carries a bird gun when he is engaged in production on the mountain. In the past year, he used the time between production to kill more than 4,000 sparrows. There are also two young experts, Liu Fakui and Zhou Houling, who installed more than 430 "press boards" (a type of trap) in the cornfields while herding cattle. From last year to now, Liu Fakui has killed more than 5,800 sparrows with press boards, and Zhou Houling has killed more than 7,000 rats and sparrows.

Fourth, they established a regular system for regular inspection and comparison. Every household has formulated a public pledge to eliminate the nine pests and pay attention to hygiene, stipulating that the indoors and outdoors should be cleaned every day, the environment should be cleaned on a small scale every three days and on a large scale every seven days, the toilet should be cleaned with a handful of grass (wild plants that kill maggots) every day, and a handful of ash (lime or plant ash) should be added after defecation. If the maggots are not completely eliminated, the manure should not be picked up. The community compares every half month, and the whole township compares once a month. Cadres go to the countryside to check production and also check sanitation. The team and community report on production and also report on the elimination of the nine pests and the promotion of hygiene. Because there is a system, there is comparison, there is inspection, and it is closely combined with production, sanitation work is persevered in, and the results of eliminating the nine pests are consolidated.

### 消灭“九害”　实现“九无”

    消灭“九害”　实现“九无”
    罗文才代表谈叙永县广木管理区除害灭病情况
    解放前：蚊蝇虱蚤无其数，臭气熏人实难当，连年疾病成灾难，死人成百真可伤。
    现在：蚊蝇绝了迹，面貌大不同，环境美如画，千家万紫红主席、各位代表：
    我完全拥护周总理所作的“政府工作报告”，并完全同意李富春副总理、李先念副总理、彭真副委员长所作的报告。
    我于今年三月视察了四川省叙永县水尾公社广木管理区（原广木乡），现在我谈一谈广木区除九害讲卫生的情况：
    叙永县是一个偏僻的山区，解放前由于反动派的剥削压迫，劳动人民过着极其贫困悲惨的生活，卫生情况极坏，一年四季疾病不断流行，随时都在死人，一九四七年回归热流行，仅广木、分水、枧槽等乡全家死光的就有三四十户；害兽害鸟严重地威胁着山区人民的生产和生活。解放后，党和政府领导人民开展了爱国卫生运动，在一九五二年消灭了回归热、天花、霍乱等几种传染病，但四害未根除，人们在生产和健康上仍受着严重威胁。从一九五七年十二月起，随着工农业生产大跃进和全国除四害、爱国卫生运动的新高潮，全县人民在党的领导下，鼓足干劲，掀起了一个声势浩大、雷厉风行的群众性的除“九害”讲卫生运动，仅六个多月的时间就基本上消灭了鼠、雀、蚊、蝇、虱、蚤、蟑螂、害兽等九害，全县基本实现了“九无”；在群众中也改变了过去不讲卫生的不良习惯，树立了人人讲卫生、个个爱清洁的新风气。在这次运动中，广木区获得了全县第一个“九无”地区的光荣称号。
    广木区位于叙永县的北面边境，是全县较高较冷的山区，纵横一百余里，拔海二千四百多公尺，山上还有未开发的森林，一年有两月以上积雪。全乡只有三百四十六户，一千五百人，真可算“地广人稀”。解放前山区人民受着反动统治的压迫剥削，加上害兽害鸟对生产的危害和疾病的威胁，农民常过着“糠菜半年粮，疾病又饥荒，冬寒无衣被，十病九死亡”的苦日子。据老农民李再扬说：“从前这里有个连花塝，二百多石地的包谷全被野猪害鸟踏烂吃光，颗粒无收，六十多石田最多能收二十多石，贫农李焕堂佃种的十八石多田产，因受害兽害鸟的糟踏，没有收成，交不齐地主的租子，地主把他的“稳手”（租金）三石谷子全都扣光，逼得一家流落他乡。广木这个地方，每年播下去的包谷、洋芋几乎全被害兽害鸟吃光，补种率达百分之八十五左右。农民既遭害兽害鸟灾困，又受地主剥削，生活十分惨苦。
    那时人民过着这样悲惨的生活，根本谈不上讲卫生。这里有一个打足沟，过去肮脏龌龊不堪，屋前屋后到处都是垃圾，屎尿遍地，积污盈尺，杂草丛生，人走这里过都要掌着捧捧把露水打一打才能走过，不然露水落在足上就要长“粪泡”（皮疹），蚊蝇成群，走路时蚊子苍蝇在脸上直碰。这里疾病经常流行，每年要死不少人。如周万金家二十人，一月就死去十人，陈生扬、黄纸匠、穆少华等几户人全家死光。当时流传着这样的歌谣：
    山高气寒广木乡，　荆棘丛林遍山岗。
    蚊蝇虱蚤无其数，　臭气熏人实难当。
    连年疾病成灾难，　死人成百真可伤。
    伪政府那管人民苦，　只知派款和派粮！
    解放后，在党的领导下，根除了土地私有制度，生产和生活水平大大提高，改变了卫生条件，初步摆脱了疾病的痛苦，但九害没有根除，人们在生产和健康上还受着很大的威胁。一九五七年十二月全县开展除九害讲卫生的运动，广木乡在党的领导下积极行动起来，采取快、速、勇、猛的突击围剿办法，迅速掀起了一个除九害讲卫生运动的热潮。全乡有一千二百多人参加了运动，经过五次大规模的围剿，在去年三月就基本消灭了九害，共计消灭了麻雀二十四万二千多只，老鼠一十二万九千余只，并消灭了大批蚊蝇、蟑螂、虱蚤、臭虫等，作到了家家户户清洁，人人讲卫生。过去龌龊不堪的打足沟现在完全改变了面貌。现在是：“一进打足沟，蚊蝇绝了踪，室内室外洁，面貌大不同，环境美如画，千家万紫红。”
    由于除九害讲卫生运动的胜利，疾病的发生和死亡也大大地减少了。去年和今年没有发生传染病，鸟兽灾害也大大减少了。特别是去年建立了人民公社以后，卫生工作搞得更好，人们的生产劲头更大了。广木乡去年粮食获得了大丰收，现在他们唱道：“病除害消忙生产，跃进花开朵朵香。人民公社真正好，社员增产喜洋洋。”
    广木区卫生工作取得这样大的成绩主要有以下几个原因：
    首先是党加强了领导，党支部认真研究了上级的指示，统一作了部署。领导亲自上阵，以实际行动带动群众，深入开展除害工作，几个乡干部每次下乡都把除害工具带上，检查生产同时也检查卫生，见到四害就消灭，见到那里脏就打扫，并帮助群众倒尿桶，搬尿筒，教育群众改变了过去床头放尿桶，臭气熏满屋的不良习惯。在大围剿中党团支部书记亲自背上干粮，带领突击队员到纵横一百多里的深沟高岭去追捕害兽害鸟，大大地鼓舞了群众除害斗志。
    其次是破除了迷信，解放了思想，作到不通就辩，不信就看。山区人民由于过去受压迫，没有文化科学知识，因而有许多人不相信九害能够除尽，有的还认为除九害要伤生害命，等等。针对这些思想，就算细账，挖苦根，实物展览，进行活人活事的教育，把被老鼠咬坏了的蚊帐、被盖、衣服、家具，从鼠洞里挖出来的粮食，麻雀肚内解剖出来的粮食等收集起来，组织了展览会，找曾经遭受过鼠雀疾病危害最深的人在会上诉苦。经过事实的教育启发，群众积极行动起来了。
    第三，是紧密结合生产，以生产为中心，坚持除九害，社员认真执行了县委提出的“大忙小搞，有空围剿，无空准备，一空就突击”的办法，使运动既有突击，又能经常化。社员上山生产同时也带上除害工具。如六十五岁的李再扬在山上搞生产，还带上一支鸟枪，去年一年中他利用生产空歇的时间就灭雀四千多只。还有两个小能手刘发奎和周厚令放牛时在玉米地安了四百三十多个榨板，去年到现在刘发奎用榨板灭雀五千八百多只，周厚令灭鼠雀七千多只。
    第四，他们建立了经常的制度，定期检查评比。每家每户订立了除九害讲卫生公约，规定了室内室外，天天打扫，环境卫生三天一小扫，七天一大扫，厕所每天一把草（杀蛆的野生植物），便后一把灰（石灰或草木灰），蛆不灭尽不挑粪，社里半月一评比，全乡一月评比一次，干部下乡检查生产同时检查卫生，队社汇报生产，也同时汇报除九害讲卫生。由于有制度，有评比，有检查，与生产紧密结合起来，因而卫生工作坚持不懈，巩固了除九害的成绩。
