Xinhua News Agency, May 20th: According to a report by the "Frankfurter Rundschau" cited by the German News Agency, the American occupation authorities stationed in West Germany shamelessly attempted to disrupt a mass rally organized by the "Committee Against Atomic Death" in Gießen last weekend.

    At the beginning of the conference, three American military aircraft flew over the venue four times in a row, and the noise of the aircraft made it impossible for the people attending the conference to hear the speakers. At the same time, an American captain named Robert brought a loudspeaker and placed it not far from the venue, then broadcast marches, making it difficult to hear the speeches at the conference.

    西德美军当局无赖干扰群众和平集会
    新华社20日讯　据德意志通讯社引用“法兰克福评论报”的报道说，驻在西德的美国占领军当局在上星期末无耻地企图破坏由“反对原子死亡”委员会在岐孙组织的一次群众大会。
    大会一开始，就有三架美国军用飞机连续四次飞过会场上空，飞机的吵闹声使得参加大会的人不能听到大会上发言的人的话。同时，一个名叫劳勃脱的美国上尉又带了扩音器来，劳勃脱把扩音器放在离会场不远的地方，然后转播进行曲，使大家听不清楚会上的讲话。
