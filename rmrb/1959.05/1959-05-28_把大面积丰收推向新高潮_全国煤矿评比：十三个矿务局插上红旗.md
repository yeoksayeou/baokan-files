Xinhua News Agency, Fushun, May 27th. The Ministry of Coal convened a conference in Fushun, the coal capital, from May 20th to 25th, with representatives from various regions and coal mines to evaluate and summarize the first round of the national coal mine large-area bumper harvest socialist labor competition, which began in March. The conference called on coal mines across the country to continue to mobilize the masses in depth and push the socialist labor competition for large-area bumper harvests to a new climax.

According to the summary at the meeting, since the launch of the large-area bumper harvest socialist labor competition in March, a large number of high-yield and large-area bumper harvest units have emerged in coal mines across the country. Among the 1,408 working faces in the 28 key mining bureaus nationwide, 360 reached a bumper harvest level of more than 10,000 tons per month in March; in April, the number of working faces with a monthly output of more than 10,000 tons in these mining bureaus increased to 405. The six mining bureaus of Kailuan, Fushun, Xishan, Fengfeng, Hebi, and Jiaozuo all achieved an average monthly output of more than 10,000 tons on all working faces in March and April. Thus, in the first four months of this year, coal production nationwide not only overfulfilled the production plan; since April, the output has also begun to stabilize at the level of the planned target, creating a good start for achieving a great leap forward in coal production this year.

The conference summarized the main experiences of carrying out the large-area bumper harvest competition, believing that this practice is an important way to fully tap the potential of existing production mines, mobilize all positive factors, and promote the overall development of coal mine production. Through the large-area bumper harvest competition, the past situation of some mines focusing on the high yield of individual working faces, while not paying enough attention to improving the output of all working faces and the overall production level of the entire mine, has been changed. The production of the entire coal mine has been improved without increasing or decreasing equipment, or without increasing or decreasing personnel. At the same time, the increase in the output of all working faces requires transportation, electromechanical, lifting, and production preparation to keep up, thus promoting the improvement of production management and technical management, and achieving overall improvement. The conference believes that the 36 advanced experiences summarized and promoted at the beginning of the movement are the main direction of technological innovation and technological revolution in coal production, and have played a major role in ensuring large-area bumper harvests.

The conference fully discussed the future work, and required coal mines in various regions to thoroughly implement the system of factory director responsibility under the leadership of the Party committee and the system of workers' representative conferences, comprehensively strengthen enterprise management, and improve and establish various necessary management systems, so that all aspects of the enterprise's work can be comprehensively improved. In the second round of the competition, it is necessary to focus on production preparation and safety work, and quickly reverse the backward state of production preparation in some coal mines, so as to achieve normal succession, steady improvement, and safe production. The conference required all mines to prepare at least six months of coal mining volume and 25% of spare working faces before October 1st. In the future, in the promotion of advanced experience, it is necessary to be good at formulating plans for the promotion of advanced experience in light of local conditions. And conduct regular inspections and evaluations of the promotion of advanced experience.

The conference decided that two more evaluations will be conducted on the coal production front this year. One is to welcome the great 10th anniversary of the National Day; the other is to welcome the National Congress of Advanced Units and Advanced Producers in Industry and the New Year's Day of 1960 to be held in the fourth quarter.

In order to mobilize the enthusiasm of the vast number of coal mine workers across the country and make the competition have a wider mass base, the conference initially formulated the requirements for local coal mines to carry out large-area red flag competitions, so as to absorb local coal mine workers into the ranks of the competition and jointly strive to achieve this year's coal production tasks.

After extensive exchange of experience and full discussion, the conference finally evaluated and selected 13 mining bureaus to receive the large-area bumper harvest red flag. The average monthly output of the working faces of Kailuan and Fushun mining bureaus was more than 15,000 tons, and they completed various national economic indicators more comprehensively, thus winning the large-area high-yield bumper harvest red flag. The average monthly output of the working faces of the eleven mining bureaus of Xishan, Hebi, Fengfeng, Jiaozuo, Jingxi, Benxi, Xuzhou, Huainan, Yangquan, Fenxi, and Zibo were all above 10,000 tons, and they received the large-area bumper harvest red flag.

### 把大面积丰收推向新高潮  全国煤矿评比：十三个矿务局插上红旗

    把大面积丰收推向新高潮
    全国煤矿评比：十三个矿务局插上红旗
    新华社抚顺27日电  煤炭部20日到25日在煤都抚顺召集各地、各煤矿代表举行大会，对3月间开始的全国煤矿大面积丰产社会主义劳动竞赛的第一个回合，进行评比总结。会议号召全国煤矿要继续深入发动群众，把争取大面积丰产的社会主义劳动竞赛运动推向新的高潮。
    根据会上总结，全国煤矿从3月份开展大面积丰产社会主义劳动竞赛以来，出现了大批高额丰产与大面积丰产单位。全国二十八个重点矿务局的一千四百零八个工作面，在3月份里，有三百六十个达到了月产万吨以上的丰产水平；4月份，这些矿务局月产万吨以上的工作面又增加到四百零五个。开滦、抚顺、西山、峰峰、鹤壁、焦作六个矿务局，3、4月份所有的工作面都达到平均月产万吨以上。这样，在今年前四个月里，全国煤矿生产不仅超额完成了产量计划；而且从4月份以来，产量也已开始稳定在计划指标的水平线上了，为实现今年煤炭生产大跃进创造了良好的开端。
    会议总结了开展大面积丰产竞赛运动的主要经验，认为这种作法是充分挖掘现有生产矿井潜力，调动一切积极因素，促进煤矿生产全面发展的重要途径。通过大面积丰产竞赛，改变了过去某些矿井偏重于个别工作面高产，而对提高全部工作面的产量和整个矿井生产水平注意不够的情况，在不增设备或少增设备、不增人或少增人的情况下提高了整个煤矿生产。同时，全部工作面产量提高后，就要求运输、机电、提升和生产准备工作跟上去，因而促进了生产管理和技术管理的改进，达到全面提高。会议认为，运动一开始总结和推广的三十六项先进经验，是煤炭生产技术革新和技术革命的主攻方向，对保证大面积丰产起了重大的作用。
    会议对今后的工作作了充分讨论，要求各地煤矿必须深入贯彻党委领导下的厂长负责制与职工代表大会制，全面加强企业管理，健全与建立各种必要的管理制度，使企业的各项工作全面提高。在第二回合的竞赛中，大抓生产准备和安全工作，迅速扭转一些煤矿生产准备落后的状态，从而达到正常接续、稳步提高、安全生产的目的。会议要求各矿在10月1日以前至少要准备好够六个月开采的煤量和25％的备用工作面。今后在推广先进经验中，要善于因地制宜的制订出推广先进经验的规划。并且对于先进经验的推广经常进行检查、评比。
    会议决定，今年煤炭生产战线上还要进行两次评比。一次是迎接伟大的国庆十周年；一次是迎接第四季度召开的全国工业先进单位与先进生产者代表大会和1960年的元旦。
    为了调动全国广大煤矿职工的积极性，使竞赛有更广泛的群众基础，会议初步制订出地方煤矿开展大面积红旗竞赛的要求，以便把地方煤矿的职工吸收到竞赛的行列中来，共同为实现今年煤炭生产任务而奋斗。
    会议经过广泛地交流经验和充分讨论，最后评比出十三个矿务局获得大面积丰产红旗。开滦和抚顺两个矿务局的单位工作面平均月产量都在一万五千吨以上，并且比较全面的完成了国家各项经济指标，因而获得了大面积高额丰产红旗。西山、鹤壁、峰峰、焦作、京西、本溪、徐州、淮南、阳泉、汾西、淄博十一个矿务局的单位工作面平均月产量都在一万吨以上，得到大面积丰产红旗。（附图片）
    兴建在首都郊区的大台煤矿现代化竖井的生产，已经大大超过原设计的生产能力。这个矿今年的产量将达到一百万吨以上。
