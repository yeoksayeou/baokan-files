Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, May 23rd: According to reports in local newspapers today, the Liaison Delegation of the General Headquarters of the Vietnam People's Army wrote to the International Commission for Vietnam on the 18th, once again protesting the South Vietnamese authorities' so-called "sweeps" in the former resistance base of the People's Army, "War Zone D." The letter pointed out that these "sweeps" were conducted under the command of American military advisors.

The letter stated that since the South Vietnamese authorities launched "sweeps" in the former "War Zone D," more than 200 people have been arrested, injured, or killed. In the bombings carried out by the South Vietnamese authorities in the Da Lai area alone on March 18th, April 4th, and April 22nd, more than ten people were injured and killed, and many houses were burned and collapsed.

It pointed out that the South Vietnamese authorities also mobilized regular troops from the former Hai Ning Province puppet army to participate in the war. South Vietnamese troops also set fire to hundreds of civilian houses along the Dong Nai River and in the Ma Da area. Many villages in the central area of the former "War Zone D," such as Jinshu, Mangling, Andang, and Gaigao, suffered extremely heavy losses. The rice, salt, and seed grain of the people of Jinshu Township were all burned. This tragic situation is no different from the situation when the French colonialists launched "sweeps" during the War of Resistance.

The Liaison Delegation reiterated the demands it made in its letter to the International Commission for Vietnam on April 22nd, and once again requested the International Commission for Vietnam to pay attention to this serious situation and immediately send mobile teams to the former "War Zone D" to investigate these serious violations of the Geneva Accords.
Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, May 23rd: According to reports in local newspapers today, the Liaison Delegation of the General Headquarters of the Vietnam People's Army wrote to the International Commission for Vietnam on May 12th, protesting the South Vietnamese authorities' illegal arrest and persecution of former resistance personnel and peaceful residents in the central region of South Vietnam.

The letter stated: "Following the 'sweeps' launched by the South Vietnamese authorities in the Bo Lai Gu area last December, on February 6th of this year, they again dispatched troops to cooperate with local militia to carry out suppression and persecution activities in the Gan Bao Long area of Bo Lai Gu Province, illegally arresting, torturing, and imprisoning a number of peaceful residents, including former resistance personnel."

The letter requested the International Commission to investigate the South Vietnamese authorities' above-mentioned serious violations of Article 14, Paragraph C of the Geneva Accords, and to force the South Vietnamese authorities to release the arrested persons and guarantee their democratic freedoms.
Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, May 23rd: According to reports in local newspapers today, representatives of the cadres gathered in Hanoi from South Vietnam and many representatives of mothers in Hanoi City have recently gone to the Hanoi office of the International Commission for Vietnam to accuse the US-Ngo Dinh Diem clique of carrying out barbaric massacres in the former resistance base areas and other provinces of South Vietnam.

The representatives demanded that the International Commission immediately take emergency measures to force the South Vietnamese authorities to stop all persecution and "sweeping" activities and abolish the fascist "Law 10/59."

    越人民军总部联络代表团函国际委员会
    抗议南越当局疯狂迫害爱国者
    要求立即调查这种违反日内瓦协议的行为
    新华社河内23日电　据此间报纸今天报道：越南人民军总司令部联络代表团在18日写信给越南国际委员会，再次抗议南越当局在前人民军抗战根据地“D战区”进行所谓“扫荡”。信里指出，这次“扫荡”是在美国军事顾问指挥下进行的。
    信里说，自从南越当局在前“D战区”展开“扫荡”以来，到目前已经有二百多人被捕、被打伤或被枪杀。仅在南越当局在3月18日、4月4日、4月22日在达莱地区进行的轰炸中，就有十多人被炸伤和炸死，许多房屋被烧毁和倒塌。
    这里指出，南越当局还调动原海宁省伪军的正规部队参战。南越的军队还放火烧毁同奈河沿岸和马达地区的成百座民房。前“D战区”中心区的许多乡村，如锦疏、芒凌、安当、盖高等乡村损失极其惨重。锦疏乡人民的米、盐、谷种全被烧光。这种悲惨情况同法国殖民者在抗战时期展开“扫荡”时的情况没有什么区别。
    联络代表团重申它在4月22日给越南国际委员会的信里提出的要求，再次要求越南国际委员会注意这种严重的情况，并且立即派遣流动小组到前“D战区”就这种严重违反日内瓦协议的行动进行调查。
    新华社河内23日电　据今天这里的报纸报道：越南人民军总司令部联络代表团5月12日写信给越南国际委员会，对南越当局在南越中部地区非法逮捕、迫害前抗战人员和和平居民提出抗议。
    信中说：“南越当局继去年12月在波来古一带展开‘扫荡’后，今年2月6日，又出动了军队同当地民卫队配合在波来古省甘保龙地带展开镇压、迫害活动，非法逮捕、拷打、监禁了一些和平居民，其中包括前抗战人员。”
    信里要求国际委员会对南越当局上述严重违反日内瓦协议第十四条丙款的行为进行调查，迫使南越当局释放被捕者和保障他们的民主自由。
    新华社河内23日电　据此间报纸今天报道，目前在河内的南越集结干部的代表和河内市母亲代表多人最近先后到越南国际委员会驻河内办事处，控告美国—吴庭艳集团在南越前抗战根据地和其他各省进行野蛮的屠杀。
    代表们要求国际委员会立即采取紧急措施，迫使南越当局停止一切迫害和“扫荡”活动，废除法西斯的“第10／59号”法令。
