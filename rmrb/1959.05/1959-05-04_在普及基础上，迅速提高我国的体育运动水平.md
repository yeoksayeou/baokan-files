Comrade Chairman, fellow representatives:

I fully endorse Premier Zhou's government work report and the reports made by Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen. Now, I would like to offer some opinions on sports work:

In recent years, under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, the people of all ethnic groups in our country, with the heroic spirit of mountains bowing their heads and rivers yielding their way, have traversed a great journey and achieved brilliant victories on all fronts. Our country's sports cause has also achieved rapid development and great achievements. Especially last year, under the glorious illumination of the Party's General Line, with the vigorous development of the Great Leap Forward in industry and agriculture and the people's commune movement, "Strengthening the body and building the motherland" has become the urgent demand of the broad masses of the people. More people deeply understand the benefits of sports, hundreds of millions of people regularly participate in physical exercise, and tens of millions of people have passed the Labor and Defense System standards. Sports, like learning culture and promoting hygiene, has become a part of the happy life of our people. The broad masses of athletes have emancipated their minds, unleashed their soaring energy, created more than 800 national records and some world records, and further inspired the enthusiasm of the masses for exercise.

The widespread development of sports not only enriches the people's cultural life and enhances understanding and friendship between our country and the people of other countries, but also greatly strengthens the physique of our people, playing an active role in coordinating production, work, and study. After young students universally participate in physical exercise, illnesses are reduced, and they are full of energy when studying. For example, in Dunhua Korean Middle School in Jilin, where sports activities are well-developed, they often rank among the top in sports competitions, have set national highest records, and the student illness rate in 1958 decreased by two-thirds compared to 1957. Academic performance has generally improved, and labor achievements are also very significant. The grain they grow and harvest themselves is enough for all teachers and students to eat for a year. This is of great benefit to cultivating a generation of young people who are physically and mentally healthy, and capable in both literary and military skills. Workers' sports are also developing vigorously, with many advanced factories and mines emerging that excel in both production and sports. The Tianjin Wool Processing Factory has consistently insisted on all employees participating in various sports activities, and their physical fitness has generally improved. The attendance rate has increased from 83% in 1953 to 97%. Last year, the factory drew one-third of its workforce to participate in steelmaking, coking, and support other fraternal factories, yet still completed the annual production task two months ahead of schedule. The broad masses of farmers also use production gaps and leisure time to exercise, which also has good results. They use the saying "Increased crop yield, increased human lifespan, strive for the top by improving the body" to describe the role of sports.

Sports are widely developed, and technical levels are rapidly improving, with seventeen world records created in the past three years.

With the increasing development of mass sports, our country's sports technical level has also greatly improved. It has not only greatly exceeded all the highest records of old China, but also created seventeen world records in weightlifting, track and field, swimming, parachuting, and other sports since June 1956. Not long ago, in the 25th World Table Tennis Championships, Rong Guotuan, a 21-year-old athlete from our country, won the men's singles world championship among more than 200 players from 38 countries and regions, winning honor for the motherland. Our men's and women's teams both ranked third in the world in the team competition. If we look back at the situation when our country first participated in the World Table Tennis Championships in 1953, the men's team was rated as tenth in the first level, and the women's team was rated as third in the second level, we can see that our speed of improvement is relatively fast. Another example is weightlifting. Chen Jingkai, a famous athlete in our country who was the first to create a world record, has improved his total score from 245 kilograms to 350 kilograms over the years. He himself has broken the world record six times in two weight classes. Currently, our country maintains four of the seven world records in the clean and jerk, three of which broke the American records. The same is true for track and field. During the thirteen years of Kuomintang rule from 1936 to 1948, the highest track and field record was only broken seven times, while in 1958 alone, the track and field record was broken 306 times. Moreover, the level of the highest records during the Kuomintang period was generally very low. Except for the 100 meters for men, only eight events were equivalent to the current level of first-class athletes, and only four events for women were equivalent to the current level of second-class athletes. But now, our country has 175 male and female track and field athletes and more than 800 first-class athletes. Compared with the strong American team, the American women's high jump record increased by only 11 centimeters in 25 years from 1.65 meters in 1932 to 1.76 meters in 1956. However, our country's women's high jump performance has improved by 37 centimeters in less than ten years after liberation, reaching 1.77 meters, and took the world record from the Americans. In the Soviet-American track and field competition last July, the American national female athlete only jumped over 1.55 meters. Currently, eight people in our country can jump over this height, and their average age is less than 19 years old. And some of our new projects that have not been developed for long, such as rowing, have also surpassed the results of the American team, the champion of the 16th Olympic Games, several times. Marathon and road cycling have also surpassed the Olympic champions and created excellent world results many times. These achievements show the level of sports in our country and, even more, show the incomparable superiority of our socialist system. It motivates millions of athletes to exercise more actively and encourages and promotes the further development of mass sports.

Premier Zhou instructed in the government work report: "In sports work, we should implement the policy of combining popularization and improvement, extensively develop mass sports, and gradually improve the level of sports in our country." We wholeheartedly support and resolutely implement this instruction. This instruction is fully in line with the actual situation of the development of sports in our country and the needs of future work. Constantly improving on the basis of popularization, and further popularizing under the guidance of improvement, the two are closely combined and promote each other. This is the law of sports development in our country. The reason why our table tennis movement can produce world champions is precisely because of its solid mass base. Four outstanding players from our country who entered the top eight in the men's singles in this World Championships, Rong Guotuan, Wang Chuanyao, Yang Ruihua, and Zhuang Jiafu, have all been defeated by rising stars in China. This mass movement of surging waves pushing forward is the endless driving force for improving our country's sports technology. And Rong Guotuan's victory has encouraged and promoted millions of young people to become table tennis enthusiasts. The development of other sports also vividly illustrates the importance of combining popularization and improvement.

In recent years, thanks to the leadership and concern of the Party and the love of the people, sports in our country has achieved certain results. However, due to our insufficient implementation of the policy of popularization and improvement, coupled with the very weak foundation of sports in old China, although we have made some efforts in the past few years, the technical level of many sports is still very low and far from the world level. For example, in swimming, out of the more than 20 world records for men and women, only one belongs to our creation. In more than 50 track and field events for men and women, our country has only created one world record, and it has not been maintained now. This situation is not commensurate with the leap forward development of various undertakings in our country. To make our country catch up with the world's advanced level in major sports, we need to make greater efforts.

Starting from the needs, voluntariness, and actual possibilities of the masses, carry out rich and colorful sports activities suitable for local conditions, time, and people

1959 is a year of continued leap forward in our country's socialist construction. Sports work must further implement the instructions of the Party Central Committee, mobilize and organize the broad masses of people to carry out physical exercise, enhance the people's physique, serve production, work, study, and national defense, and serve the victorious realization of completing and overfulfilling the national economic plan centered on the four major indicators of steel, coal, grain, and cotton. To carry out mass sports, under the leadership of the Party, we must start from the needs, voluntariness, and actual possibilities of the masses, carry out various sports activities that are rich, colorful, and loved by the masses, suitable for local conditions, time, and people. Young people are in the stage of growing up, and special attention should be paid to strengthening their sports education and organizing them to exercise. This is not only an important measure to fundamentally enhance the physique of our people, but also a reliable guarantee for popularizing sports and improving the technical level of sports in our country. For the outstanding individuals with sports talents who emerge from mass movements, we must strengthen training and make the political and technical closely combined. Why do some athletes often have abnormal performance on the spot? In addition to technical shortcomings and lack of experience, the lack of political guidance is a very important reason. Only when athletes understand the great significance of creating excellent results and winning honor for the motherland can they better learn and master technology and fully display technology. In terms of technology, we must work hard, exercise diligently, learn from the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and other countries, summarize our own experience, create tactics and techniques suitable for the characteristics of our athletes, and establish our own style.

The First National Games, which will be held in September this year, are to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the National Day, review the achievements of sports in the past ten years, further promote the development of mass sports, strive to create excellent results in several sports, and closely combine the popularization and improvement of sports. This comprehensive sports event is unprecedented in scale, and it will be a competition ground for promoting the communist style of striving for the top in our country. At present, it has become an important force to encourage sports workers across the country to work harder and athletes to constantly create new records. Sports workers and athletes across the country should continue to go all out, strive for the top, strive to improve sports technology, and hold the National Games well in accordance with the instructions of the Party Central Committee, to welcome the 10th anniversary of the National Day.

Fellow representatives, the sports workers and athletes across the country express the greatest anger at the heinous behavior of the former Tibetan local government and upper-class reactionary forces in openly launching armed rebellion with the support of imperialism, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and foreign reactionaries to undermine the unification of the motherland. We resolutely support all the government's policies and measures to quell the Tibetan rebellion, and warmly celebrate the brilliant victory achieved by the Chinese People's Liberation Army in crushing the rebels. Tibet is an inseparable part of our country's sacred territory. Indian expansionists vainly attempt to follow the path taken by past imperialists and will inevitably reap the bitter fruit. Any activities that interfere in our country's internal affairs and split our country's unification are bound to be completely defeated in front of the 600 million Chinese people. Tibet, like other parts of the country, will advance rapidly under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao. Tibetan athletes will also appear at this year's National Games with greater enthusiasm and radiance, celebrating the glorious unification of the great motherland with the people of the whole country. Dark and backward Tibet will never return. Let us cheer for the birth of a democratic and happy new Tibet.

### 在普及基础上，迅速提高我国的体育运动水平

    在普及基础上，迅速提高我国的体育运动水平
    荣高棠代表的发言主席、各位代表：
    我完全拥护周总理所作的政府工作报告，和李富春副总理、李先念副总理、彭真副委员长所作的报告。现在我仅就体育工作发表一点意见：
    几年来，我国各族人民在党中央和毛主席的英明领导下，以高山低头、河水让路的英雄气魄，迈过了伟大的里程，在各个战线上都取得了辉煌的胜利。我国体育事业也得到了迅速的发展和巨大成就。尤其是去年，在党的总路线的光辉照耀下，随着工农业大跃进和人民公社化运动的蓬勃发展，“锻炼身体，建设祖国”已成为广大人民的迫切要求，更多的人深切地了解到体育运动的好处，成亿人经常参加体育锻炼，上千万人通过了劳卫制标准，体育已和学文化、讲卫生一样成为我国人民幸福生活的一部分。广大运动员解放思想，发挥冲天干劲，创造了八百余次全国纪录和一些世界纪录，又进一步鼓舞了群众锻炼的热情。
    体育运动的广泛发展，不仅丰富了人民的文化生活，增进了我国与各国人民之间的了解和友谊，同时，大大增强了我国人民的体质，对配合生产、工作、学习起着积极作用。青年学生普遍参加体育锻炼后，疾病减少，学习时精力充沛。如体育活动开展得较好的吉林敦化县朝鲜中学，不仅在运动竞赛中常常名列前茅，创造过全国最高纪录，而且学生患病率一九五八年比一九五七年减少三分之二，学习成绩普遍提高，劳动成果也十分显著，单是他们自种自收的粮食，就够全校师生吃一年。这对于培养身心健康、能文能武的青年一代大有好处。职工体育运动，也有蓬勃的发展，涌现了许多生产好，体育也好的先进厂矿。天津绒毛加工厂，全厂职工一贯坚持参加各项体育活动，体质普遍增强，出勤率从一九五三年的百分之八十三提高到百分之九十七，去年全厂抽出三分之一的人力参加炼钢、炼焦和支援其他兄弟厂，仍然提前两个月完成了全年的生产任务。广大农民利用生产空隙和稍闲时间进行锻炼，也收到良好效果。他们用“田增产，人增寿，练好身体争上游”来形容体育运动的作用。
    体育运动广泛开展，技术水平飞跃提高，近三年中创造了十七次世界纪录
    随着群众性体育运动的日益开展，我国运动技术水平也有很大提高。不仅大大超过了旧中国的全部最高纪录，一九五六年六月到现在，还在举重、田径、游泳、跳伞等项目中，创造了十七次世界纪录。不久前，在第二十五届世界乒乓球锦标赛中，我国年仅二十一岁的选手容国团，又在三十八个国家和地区的二百多名好手中，夺得了男子单打世界冠军，为祖国争取了荣誉；我国男女队在团体赛中双双名列世界第三。如果我们回顾一下，一九五三年我国第一次参加世界乒乓球锦标赛的情况，那时男队被评为一级第十名，女队被评为二级第三名，就可以看到，我们提高的速度是比较快的。又如举重，我国第一个创造世界纪录的著名选手陈镜开，几年来总成绩从二百四十五公斤提高到三百五十公斤，他一人就在两个级别中六破世界纪录。目前，在挺举七个级别的世界纪录中，我国保持了四个，其中三个是打破美国的纪录。从田径运动看也是这样，在国民党统治的一九三六年到一九四八年十三年间，田径的最高纪录，只刷新了七次，而一九五八年一年就打破了田径纪录三百零六次。而且国民党时期的最高纪录的水平一般都很低，男子除了百公尺外，只有八项相当于现在的一级运动员水平，女子只有四项相当于现在的二级运动员水平。可是现在，我国男女田径运动健将就有一百七十五人，一级运动员八百多人。就拿实力很强的美国队来比，美国女子跳高纪录从一九三二年的一点六五公尺，到一九五六年的一点七六公尺，二十五年间只提高了十一公分，而我国女子跳高的成绩，在解放后不到十年中却提高了三十七公分，达到一点七七公尺，拿下了美国人手中的世界纪录。去年七月苏美田径比赛中，美国国家女选手只跳过一点五五公尺，目前我国有八个人能跳过这个高度，她们的平均年龄还不到十九岁。而我们一些开展不久的新项目，如赛艇也数次压倒第十六届奥林匹克运动会冠军美国队的成绩，马拉松、公路自行车也多次压倒奥运会历届冠军和创造世界优秀成绩。这些成绩的获得，说明了我国体育运动的水平，更显示了我国社会主义制度的无比优越。它激励着千百万运动员更加积极地锻炼，又鼓舞和推动了群众体育运动的进一步开展。
    周总理在政府工作报告中指示的：“在体育工作中，应当贯彻执行普及和提高相结合的方针，广泛开展群众性的体育运动，逐步提高我国的体育水平。”我们衷心拥护，并坚决贯彻。这个指示完全符合我国体育运动发展的实际情况和今后工作的需要。在普及基础上不断提高，在提高指导下进一步普及，二者紧密结合又互相推动，这是我国体育运动发展的规律。我国的乒乓球运动之所以能出现世界冠军，正是由于它的雄厚的群众基础。我国进入这届世界锦标赛男子单打前八名的四位优秀选手：容国团、王传耀、杨瑞华、庄家富，在国内都被后起之秀打败过。这种滚滚后浪推前浪的群众运动，正是提高我国运动技术的无穷动力。而容国团的优胜，又鼓舞和推动千百万青年成为乒乓球爱好者。其他各项运动的发展情况也都生动地说明了普及和提高相结合的重要性。
    几年来，我国体育运动由于党的领导关怀，和人民群众的喜爱，取得了一定的成绩。但是，由于我们对普及和提高这一方针贯彻执行得还不够，再加上旧中国体育基础十分薄弱，虽然经过几年来的努力，做了一些工作，可是不少运动项目的技术水平还是很低，离世界水平还相距很远。像游泳，在男女二十多个世界纪录中，属于我们创造的只有一项。男女田径五十多单项中，我国只出现过一次世界纪录，现在还没有保持下来。这种状况和我们国家各项事业的飞跃发展是不相称的。要使我国在主要运动项目上赶上世界先进水平，需要我们作更大的努力。
    从群众需要、自愿和实际可能出发，因地、因时、因人制宜，开展丰富多彩的体育运动
    一九五九年是我国社会主义建设事业继续跃进的一年，体育工作必须进一步贯彻党中央的指示，发动和组织广大人民进行体育锻炼，增强人民体质，为生产、工作、学习和国防服务，为完成和超额完成以钢、煤、粮、棉四大指标为中心的国民经济计划的胜利实现服务。开展群众体育运动，必须在党的领导下，从群众的需要、自愿和实际的可能出发，因地、因时、因人制宜，开展丰富多彩、为群众所喜爱的各种各样的体育活动。青少年正处在长身体的时期，特别要重视对他们加强体育教育，组织他们进行锻炼。这不仅是从根本上增强我国人民体质的重要措施，也是普及体育运动和提高我国运动技术水平的可靠保证。对于群众运动中涌现出来的、具有运动才能的优秀人物，要加强培养和训练，使政治和技术紧密结合起来。为什么有些运动员往往临场出现失常现象？除了技术上的缺点和经验不足外，政治没有挂帅是很重要的原因。只有使运动员了解到创造优秀成绩、为祖国争取荣誉的重大意义，才能更好地学习和掌握技术，也才能充分发挥技术。在技术上必须刻苦钻研，认真锻炼，学习苏联和其他国家的先进经验，总结自己的经验，创造适合我国运动员特长的战术和技术，树立自己的风格。
    将在今年九月举行的第一届全国运动会，是为了庆祝国庆十周年，检阅十年来体育运动的成果，进一步推动群众体育运动的开展，在若干运动项目中争取创造优异的成绩，把体育运动的普及和提高密切结合起来。这次综合性的运动会规模是空前的，它将是发扬我国人民力争上游的共产主义风格的一个比武场。目前它已成为鼓舞全国体育工作者更加努力工作，广大运动员不断创造新纪录的重要力量。全国体育工作者和运动员要按照党中央的指示，继续鼓足干劲，力争上游，努力提高运动技术水平，开好全运会，来迎接国庆十周年。
    各位代表，对于原西藏地方政府和上层反动势力在帝国主义、蒋介石匪帮和外国反动派支持下，公开发动武装叛乱，破坏祖国统一的罪恶行为，全国体育工作者和运动员表示最大的愤怒。我们坚决拥护政府关于平定西藏叛乱的一切政策和措施，热烈欢庆中国人民解放军粉碎叛匪所取得的辉煌胜利。西藏是我国神圣领土不可分割的一部分，印度扩张主义分子妄想走过去帝国主义走过的绝路，必将自食恶果；任何干涉我国内政，分裂我国统一的活动必定在六亿中国人民面前遭到彻底的失败。西藏将和全国各地一样，在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下迅速前进，西藏运动员也将更加干劲冲天，容光焕发地出现在今年的全国运动会上，与全国人民共庆伟大祖国光荣统一的十周年。黑暗、落后的西藏将一去不复返了，让我们欢呼，民主的幸福的新西藏的诞生。
