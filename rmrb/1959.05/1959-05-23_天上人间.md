Heaven and Earth
Yang Min

Recently, a Soviet scientist proposed the hypothesis that the two satellites of Mars are artificial satellites. He believes that because oxygen is so scarce on Mars, although the satellites remain, the "people" on Mars have long since perished. Subsequently, another scientist further confirmed this hypothesis, but he believes that advanced life forms on Mars are still surviving. In any case, the "heaven and earth" that has been fantasized about since ancient times has finally taken on a bit of realistic significance.

The imagined heaven and earth are extraordinarily mysterious, far from comparable to the "mortal world." But what is the reality?

Like Earth, Mars also has rotation and revolution. The time it takes to rotate once is twenty-four hours and thirty-seven minutes, only forty minutes more than Earth's rotation. That is to say, there is also day and night on Mars. When Martian creatures spend a day, we on Earth have only spent a little more than a day. However, it takes more than six hundred and eighty days for Mars to complete one revolution, so a year there is almost equivalent to two years on Earth.

The angle of inclination between Mars's equatorial plane and its orbital plane is similar to Earth's, so the seasonal changes there are also roughly the same as on Earth. However, due to the longer orbital period, the duration of each season is also longer.

Mars seen through a telescope is a beautiful orange-yellow color, with snow-white patches (also known as polar caps) at the north and south poles. Some people believe that this may be a phenomenon reflected by frozen ice and snow. In summer, these white patches often gradually shrink, and in winter, they gradually increase again, very regularly. It is said that this is due to seasonal changes, with the cycle of freezing and thawing, thawing and freezing of ice and snow at the poles. When the white patches shrink, the area becomes hazy, possibly due to the melting ice evaporating into clouds and fog. This phenomenon is also somewhat similar to the situation at the Earth's poles.

A major difference from Earth is that Mars has no vast oceans, and water is very scarce. Deserts and barren hills may be everywhere, which is very unfavorable for crop cultivation. Wouldn't the advanced life forms there dig canals to divert ice water from the poles to irrigate the fields? This question has been hotly debated in the past. Now that the hypothesis of artificial satellites on Mars has been put forward, the construction of canals is naturally more possible. The idea that there are canals on Mars is based on the existence of many crisscrossing green stripes on the planet. These stripes are about thirty to forty kilometers wide and hundreds or thousands of kilometers long. The reason they appear green is said to be due to the lush vegetation on both sides of the canals, facilitated by irrigation. Interestingly, when the white patches at the poles shrink, these stripes become clearly visible, while when the white patches expand, the stripes disappear. Some say that this is because most of the canals there draw water from the poles. When the white patches expand, which means the ice and snow at the poles continue to increase, the canals dry up, so they become indistinguishable from the land. When the white patches shrink, which means the ice and snow melt, the water in the canals flows, and the plants on both banks thrive, turning green and making their traces obvious.

The gravity on Mars is only about two-fifths of that on Earth, so the atmosphere is weakly bound, and constantly escapes. Its density is now only about one-thousandth of the Earth's atmosphere. This also greatly reduces the temperature regulation, causing the temperature difference between day and night to often reach thirty or forty degrees Celsius. As for breathing, it would of course be extremely difficult. So recently, Soviet scientists have suggested that Martian creatures may live in sealed caves, relying on artificially produced oxygen to maintain breathing, and have to wear special clothing when traveling or working outdoors!

As for Mercury, because it is closest to the sun, the side facing the sun is hot enough to melt lead; Jupiter, Pluto, and other planets are too far from the sun and so cold that even liquid mercury would freeze as hard as iron; therefore, they would not have any living beings. Venus is thought to have living beings, but it is surrounded by clouds, and the true face of its surface has not yet been clarified. If there really is a "heavenly" "world," its situation is probably not better than that on Earth.

However, it is worth mentioning that if there are indeed living beings on Mars, their wisdom and culture must be very advanced. The manufacture of satellites can fully illustrate this point. Recently, Soviet scientists have also suggested that the large meteorite that fell to Earth fifty years ago was a spacecraft from Mars, which is also a good illustration. In addition, Mars is smaller than Earth, and it is estimated that it cooled down from its initial molten state to a temperature suitable for the emergence of life millions of years earlier than Earth. That is to say, the evolution of life on Mars is a big step ahead of that on our Earth, so according to the theory of biological evolution, it can also prove that life on Mars may be advanced.

According to reports, humans will be able to visit Mars in just a few decades. And the preliminary calculations for launching a rocket with various instruments are already completed. Therefore, whether there are advanced living beings on Mars, and what the details of the "heavenly world" are, will soon be finally clarified.

    天上人间
    杨旻
    最近，苏联一位科学家提出了火星上的两个卫星是人造卫星的假定。他认为：由于火星上氧气已十分缺少，卫星虽在，火星上的“人”却早已灭亡了。接着，另一位科学家进一步肯定了这个假定，不过他却认为火星上的高级生物目前还是生存着的。不管怎样，自古以来所幻想的“天上人间”，总算是有了几分现实的意义了。
    幻想中的天上人间是异常神秘的，远非“凡世”可比。但事实究竟怎样呢？
    和地球一样，火星也有自转和公转。它自转一次所需的时间是二十四时三十七分多，比地球的自转只多四十多分钟。这就是说：火星上也有昼夜，火星上的生物度过一天，我们在地球上不过打发了一天多一点点。不过火星公转一周，却需时六百八十多天，那里的一年，倒是差不多要相当于地球上的两年了。
  　火星的赤道平面和它运行的轨道平面之间的倾斜角，同地球的差不多，所以那里的季节变化，和地球上也大致相同。但由于公转周期较长，使得那里各季的时间也较久。
    望远镜中看到的火星，是美丽的橙黄色，南北两极则有雪白的斑块（也称为极冠）。有些人认为：可能是封冻的冰雪所反映的现象。夏天，这白斑常逐渐缩小，冬天一到，则又逐渐增大，很有规律。据说，这是由于季节变化，两极冰雪冻而又解，解而又冻的循环变化所造成。当白斑缩小时，那里便会变得朦胧一片，可能就是融解的冰，蒸发升腾为云雾所致。这现象和地球上两极的情形，也有一些相似的地方。
    和地球上差别较大的，就是火星上没有汪洋大海，水分十分缺乏，沙漠和荒丘，可能到处都是。这是非常不利于农作物的栽培的。难道那里的高级生物不会开凿运河，引两极的冰水灌溉田畴吗？这问题从前曾热烈争论过。现在既提出了火星上有人造卫星的假定，则运河的开凿，自然更有可能了。火星上有运河的说法，是根据火星上有不少纵横交错的绿色条纹而提出的。这种条纹大约有三、四十公里宽，数百或数千公里长。它所以呈绿色，据说是由于运河两岸灌溉便利，草木茂盛的缘故。有趣的是：当两极白斑缩小时，这条纹便明显可见，而白斑扩大时，条纹却隐灭无形。有人说：这是因为那里的运河大都是从两极引水，当白斑扩大，也就是两极冰雪继续增加时，运河干涸，所以便和陆地混淆不分。等到白斑缩小，也就是冰雪融解时，运河中水流荡漾，两岸植物滋生，翠绿成荫，形迹也就明显起来了。
    火星上的重力大概只有地球上的五分之二左右，所以空气受到的束缚很小，不断逃跑，到现在它的密度大约只相当于地球上空气的千分之一左右了。这也大大减小了气温的调节作用，使日夜温度之差，经常达三、四十度之多。至于呼吸，当然更会极端困难。所以最近苏联的科学家提出：火星上的生物可能会住在密闭的洞穴里，依靠人工制备的氧气来维持呼吸，外出游览或工作，随时都得穿上特制的服装哩！
  　至于水星，因为最接近太阳，向日的一面热得足以使铅融化；木星、冥王星等则因为离太阳太远，又冷得连液态的水银也会冻结得像铁一般硬；因此都不会有生物存在的。金星上虽被认为可能有生物，但它的四周云雾弥漫，地表的真面目，现在还没有弄清楚。“天上”果真有“人间”，其境况大概不会比地球上优越的。
    不过值得一提的是：火星上如果确有生物，那它们的智慧和文化，一定会非常高超。卫星的制造，便可充分说明这一点。最近苏联的科学家又认为五十年前落到地球上来的大陨石，是来自火星的宇宙飞船，也都是很好的说明。此外，火星比地球小，它由当初的熔融状态凝结，冷却到适于产生生命的温度，估计要比地球早几百万年。这就是说：火星上生物的进化，比我们地球上的要占先一大步，所以按生物进化的理论说，也可证明火星上的生物可能是高级的。
    据报载：人类访问火星，只要几十年光景就能实现。而发射一个带有各种仪器的火箭前往，在计算方面的准备工作，目前已经完成了。所以火星上究竟是否有高级生物？“天上人间”的详细情况如何？不久的将来就可以最后弄清楚。
