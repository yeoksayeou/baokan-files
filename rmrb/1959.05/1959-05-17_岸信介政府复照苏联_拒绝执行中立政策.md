Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, May 15th: The Kishi Nobusuke government today submitted a note to the Soviet Ambassador to Japan, stating its refusal to accept the suggestion that Japan implement a policy of neutrality.

The Soviet government sent a note to the Japanese government on May 4th, expressing its hope that Japan would not engage in nuclear armament and would pursue a policy of neutrality. The Soviet Union's positive suggestion received widespread support from the Japanese public. However, in today's reply, the Kishi Nobusuke government stated that "a policy of neutrality does not conform to Japan's fundamental position of choosing to safeguard its security." It even slandered the Soviet Union for "interfering" in Japan's internal affairs.

The Kishi Nobusuke government's reply stated on the one hand:
	“As a matter of policy, Japan does not agree to the introduction of nuclear weapons into Japan, and will not arm the Japanese military with such weapons”; but at the same time, it expressed its unwillingness to accept the Soviet Union's proposal to establish a nuclear-free zone in Asia and the Pacific. Previously, Kishi Nobusuke had repeatedly insisted in the Diet that the US military's introduction of nuclear weapons into Japan "does not violate the constitution," and that the Japanese army could also possess nuclear weapons.

In its reply, the Kishi Nobusuke government also described the Japan-US "Security Treaty," which serves the US aggressive policy, as a "purely defensive" treaty, and stated that it "cannot threaten other countries." However, just recently, Kishi Nobusuke himself stated in the Diet that the Japanese army could "attack enemy bases" and that "joint combat situations could occur" on Okinawa with the Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek cliques.

### 岸信介政府复照苏联  拒绝执行中立政策

    岸信介政府复照苏联
    拒绝执行中立政策
    新华社15日讯　东京消息：岸信介政府今天向苏联驻日本大使提交了一份照会，表示拒绝接受关于日本实行中立政策的建议。
    苏联政府曾经在5月4日给日本政府一个照会，表示希望日本不实行核武装，奉行中立政策。苏联的积极建议得到了日本公众广泛的支持。但是，岸信介政府在今天的复照中却说什么“中立政策不符合日本选择的保障它的安全的基本立场”。它反而还诬蔑苏联“干涉”日本内政。
    岸信介政府的复照一方面说：
  “作为政策，日本不同意把核武器运进日本，并且不会用这种武器来武装日本军”；但是它同时又表示不肯接受苏联关于在亚洲和太平洋建立无核武器地区的建议。在这以前，岸信介在国会里曾经不只一次地硬说美军把核武器运进日本“并不违反宪法”，日本军队也可以保有核武器。
    岸信介政府在复照中还把为美国侵略政策服务的日美“安全条约”说成是“纯粹防御性的”条约，并且说什么它“不可能威胁其他国家。可是，就在不久以前，岸信介自己曾经在国会里说，日本军队可以“进攻敌人的基地”，并且可能在冲绳岛同李承晚和蒋介石集团“发生共同作战的情况”。
