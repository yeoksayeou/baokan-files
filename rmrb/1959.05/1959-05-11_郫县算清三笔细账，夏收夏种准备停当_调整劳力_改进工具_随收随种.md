Chengdu, May 10th (People's Daily) – Pixian County, Sichuan Province, which took the lead in launching a large-scale, high-yield competition, has completed its preparations for the wheat harvest. On the eve of the wheat harvest, the rural areas throughout the county are displaying a particularly busy and joyous scene, with everyone mobilized and everyone taking action to resolutely fight this harvest battle, ensuring a bountiful harvest and bringing every grain home.

Pixian County is located in the center of the western Sichuan Plain and is a well-known grain-producing area in Sichuan Province. The planting area for summer harvest crops in the county is not only larger than last year but also growing well and maturing early. Nearly 300,000 mu of wheat, rapeseed, and other crops are approaching the harvest period, and a good harvest is in sight. This year, the county's area for planting mid-season rice is also much larger than last year. Harvesting and planting together, two kinds of work squeezed together, will inevitably put a strain on labor.

In order to overcome the labor shortage, many communes throughout the county launched debates as early as mid-April to carefully calculate the three accounts of farm work, labor needs, and labor force. Based on the materials and methods proposed by the masses' discussions, the Pixian County Committee of the Communist Party of China recently further investigated and ranked the county's harvest and planting areas and labor needs. After investigation and research, they found that the potential of the existing labor force is very large. For example, when calculating the overall account: more than 75% of the county's labor force is already used for agricultural production, but some labor force has not been well utilized. For example, after agricultural middle school students return to the production team, most are not organized into groups, and the production team leader often forgets about them when assigning work; even if they are grouped, there are no labor quotas, and they are credited for whatever they do. These are all strong laborers, and their enthusiasm cannot be brought into play, which has a great impact on production. For example, some communes have low labor quotas, and members cannot distinguish their responsibilities when working. Some communes do not seriously evaluate work and record points, which affects the enthusiasm of strong laborers. After solving the above problems, mobilizing cadres from county-level organizations, school teachers and students, and urban residents to support agricultural production during the busy harvest and planting season can solve a large part of the labor shortage.

After the labor force is deployed to the forefront of agricultural production, how can timely harvesting, timely planting, and planting immediately after harvesting be achieved? This requires the rational organization and use of these laborers. Currently, the county arranges the harvesting of some crops, such as barley and broad beans, in advance, and postpones the harvesting of others, such as buckwheat, according to the different seasons of various crops, to ensure the completion of the harvesting and planting tasks for large-area crops such as wheat, rapeseed, and rice. At the same time, each commune organizes a certain number of specialized teams to carry out specialized harvesting, drying, and threshing, so as to determine people based on the work and assign work based on people, ensuring both quantity and quality. In terms of labor arrangement, each commune takes the management area as a unit and ranks the work on a weekly and daily basis, and then, according to the amount of labor needed, the level of labor skills, and the strength of the labor force, implements the use of demarcation lines. Based on this, each production team and professional organization formulates a daily work plan, so that the plan is implemented to people and fields, with people and fields matched one-to-one, and everything is contracted to the end, so that wheat is harvested as soon as it ripens, and planting follows immediately after harvesting.

In order to strengthen the leadership of the summer harvest and planting assault campaign, the first secretaries of party committees at all levels in the county personally take charge, go deep into the front line, participate in labor, and give specific commands; cadres at all levels also divide areas of responsibility and are responsible at each level, and conscientiously carry out work in the demonstration fields, exchange experiences in a timely manner, and guide production.

Another way to solve the labor shortage during the summer harvest and planting period is to launch a tool reform movement on a county-wide scale. Recently, the county manufactured more than 16,000 threshers, simple rice transplanters, carts, handcarts, and other tools. At the same time, more than 200 li of field wooden rail transport roads were built. In order to welcome the upcoming bumper wheat harvest, the county widely uses water power as a motive force on the crisscrossing river networks, renovating 40 water mills, using the water power of each water mill to drive 10 to 40 threshers, and leveling the ground around the water mills to make threshing grounds. The efficiency of each water-powered thresher is 20 times higher than that of manual threshing. Originally, 800,000 man-days were needed to thresh 100,000 mu of wheat. Due to the full implementation of mechanical threshing, only 40,000 man-days are needed to complete all the threshing, and labor intensity will be greatly reduced.

Currently, the county is launching a surge of over-quota and high-efficiency competition, fighting hard in "Red May," with regular comparisons and competitions between teams and between people. This type of competition is welcomed because it is small in scope, short in duration, closely integrated with each operation, and implements the principle of more work, more pay, combined with political education and material incentives.

### 郫县算清三笔细账，夏收夏种准备停当  调整劳力  改进工具  随收随种

    郫县算清三笔细账，夏收夏种准备停当
    调整劳力  改进工具  随收随种
    本报成都10日电　四川省首先发起大面积高额丰产竞赛的郫县，已经做好了迎接麦收的准备工作。麦收前夕，全县农村到处都呈现着特别繁忙的欢乐景象，人人动员，个个动手，坚决打好收割这一仗，保证丰产丰收，颗粒还家。
    郫县地处川西平原中心，是四川省的著名粮食产区。全县夏收作物种植面积不仅比去年扩大，而且长得好，成熟早。现在全县将近三十万亩小麦、油菜等作物已接近收割期，丰收已经在望。今年全县中稻栽插面积也比去年扩大很多。又收又栽，两样活路挤在一起，劳力必然感到紧张。
    为了克服劳动力不足的困难，全县许多公社早在4月中旬就发动群众开展辩论，细算农活、需工量和劳力三笔账。中共郫县委员会根据群众讨论提出的材料和办法，最近又进一步对全县收栽面积和劳动力的需要情况，进行了摸底排队。在调查研究以后，他们发现现有劳动力的潜力很大。例如在算大账时：全县已有75％以上的劳动力用于农业生产，但有些劳动力未能很好发挥作用。例如农业中学学生回到生产队后，多未编组，生产队长派工经常忘掉他们；编了组的也没有劳动定额，做多少算多少。这些人都是强劳力，他们的积极性不能发挥，对生产有很大影响。又如有的公社劳动定额偏低，社员干活时又分不清责任，有的公社评工记分不认真，劳动力强的社员的积极性受了影响。以上问题解决后，在收种大忙期间，再动员全县机关干部、学校师生和城镇居民支援农业生产，这样就可以解决很大一部分劳力缺乏的问题。
    劳动力开上农业生产最前线以后，怎样做到适时收割、适时栽种、随收随种呢？这就需要合理地组织使用这些劳力。现在，全县根据各种作物的季节早晚，错前错后，有的作物如大麦、葫豆提前安排收割，荞子等则推后，以保证完成小麦、油菜、水稻等大面积作物的收栽任务。同时各公社都组织一定数量的专业队，进行专收专晒专打，做到因活定人，因人派活，既保证数量，又保证质量。在劳动力安排上，各个公社都以管理区为单位，按周、按日进行活路排队，然后再根据需工多少、劳力技术高低、劳力强弱，实行划线使用。在这基础上，各个生产队和专业组织都订出每天的出工计划，使计划落实到人、到田，人田对号，一包到底，务使小麦黄一块收一块，收一块种一块。
    为了加强夏收夏种突击运动的领导，全县各级党委第一书记都亲自挂帅，深入前线，参加劳动，具体指挥；各级干部也都分片包干、层层负责，并且认真搞好指挥田，及时交流经验，指导生产。
    另一个解决夏收夏种期间劳动力不足问题的办法，是在全县范围内大搞工具改革运动。最近全县制造的脱粒机、简易插秧机、架架车、手推车等就有一万六千多部。同时还修建了二百多里的田间木轨运输道。为了迎接即将到来的麦季大丰收，全县在纵横交错的河网上，广泛以水力作动力，将四十座水碾水磨进行了改造，利用每座水碾的水力，带动十部到四十部脱粒机，并把水碾周围的地平出来做打谷场。每部水力脱粒机的效率比人力脱粒提高二十倍。全县十万亩小麦，原来要八十万个人工才能打完。由于全部实行机械脱粒，只要四万个人工就可全部打完，而且将大大减轻劳动强度。
    现在，全县正掀起一个超定额高工效的竞赛热潮，大战“红五月”，队与队、人与人之间都展开了定期评比竞赛。这种竞赛由于范围小，时间短，紧密结合每项作业，贯彻了多劳多得和政治教育与物质鼓励相结合的方针，普遍受到欢迎。
