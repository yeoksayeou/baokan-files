Xinhua News Agency, Lüda, May 23rd. The employees of the Lüda City light industry system successfully trial-produced more than 1,500 new types and specifications of light industrial products from January to April, an increase of nearly one and a half times compared to the same period last year.

    At the beginning of this year, the light industrial factories in Lüda City began to seize the trial production of new products. While vigorously developing high-quality and high-yield products, the Lüda Cotton Weaving Factory assigned some personnel to specialize in trial production, and in just four months, they trial-produced more than 300 new varieties. The "Youth Velvet" trial-produced by this factory changed the corduroy from a striped shape to a regular concave-convex diamond shape, and dyed it into seven or eight bright colors such as pea green, purplish brown, and indanthrene blue, which is both beautiful and generous. The Jinzhou Textile Factory and the Dalian Textile Factory, which have been completing their production plans ahead of schedule every month since the beginning of this year, have also successfully trial-produced high-grade fabrics such as poplin. The Lüda Glass Products Factory has successfully trial-produced more than 300 new varieties, such as glass motor housings, most of which are products that meet the urgent needs of industrial and agricultural production. The Dalian Rope and Net Factory, which rarely trial-produced new products in the past, has also successfully trial-produced nylon ethylene fishing net rope this year, while ensuring the completion of its production plan.

    In the trial production of new products, all factories have paid attention to strengthening the leadership of full-time organizations for trial production of new products, and extensively mobilized the masses to participate in the trial production work, thereby greatly speeding up the trial production speed. The Lüda Knitting Factory and the Lüda Cannery Food General Factory, due to mobilizing the masses, have also trial-produced a large number of new products even when certain raw materials were extremely scarce.

    旅大市积极增产轻工业新产品
    新华社旅大23日电　旅大市轻工业系统职工1至4月份共试制成功新品种新规格的轻工业产品一千五百多种，比去年同期增长了将近一倍半。
    旅大市轻工业工厂在今年初就开始抓紧了新产品的试制工作。旅大棉织厂在大搞优质高产的同时，抽出部分人员专门进行试制工作，在短短的四个月里试制出三百多种新品种。这个厂试制的青年绒，把条条形状的灯芯绒改变成一种有规律的凹凸菱形，并且染成豆绿、酱紫、士林品蓝等七、八种鲜艳色彩，既美观，又大方。今年以来月月提前完成生产计划的金州纺织厂和大连纺织厂，也试制成功了府绸等高级布。旅大玻璃制品厂试制成功玻璃电动机外壳等三百多种新品种，绝大部分是满足工农业生产迫切需要的产品。过去很少试制新产品的大连绳网厂，今年也在保证完成生产计划的前提下试制成功了尼龙乙烯鱼网绳。
    在新产品试制工作中，各厂都注意了加强对试制新产品的专职机构的领导，广泛地发动群众参加试制工作，从而大大加快了试制速度。旅大针织厂和旅大罐头食品总厂，由于发动群众，在某些原料、材料极为缺乏的情况下，也试制出大量新产品。
