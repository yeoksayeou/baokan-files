Comrade Chairman, fellow deputies:
　　After listening to the government work report by Premier Zhou Enlai of the State Council, and the reports by Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, as well as Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, in recent days, I feel greatly encouraged. I wholeheartedly and enthusiastically support them.
　　Just as our people across the country, under the leadership of the Party, are full of confidence and united to strive for a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in 1959, British imperialism and Indian expansionists have instigated a small group of upper-class reactionaries in Tibet to openly launch an armed rebellion, splitting our great motherland's unity. I express boundless anger at this. We must solemnly warn the British imperialists and Indian expansionists: Tibet is Chinese territory and no interference from others will be tolerated! The Tibetan affair is entirely China's internal affair and no interference from anyone will be permitted. Indian expansionists seem to have forgotten the painful history of India's past colonial rule under British imperialism, and have inherited an unsavory mantle from British imperialism. However, they should know that the great Chinese people are not to be trifled with, and all interventionists and expansionists will not have a good end!
　　I am an ordinary traditional Chinese medicine doctor, and to be elected as a National People's Congress representative to participate in such a meeting is entirely an honor and trust given to the traditional Chinese medicine community by the Party, Chairman Mao, and the people. Therefore, I feel both ashamed and extremely excited.
　　Under the correct leadership of the Party, Zhejiang Province's health undertakings, like those across the country, have achieved tremendous accomplishments and a leap forward situation has emerged. The patriotic health campaign centered on eliminating the four pests, promoting hygiene, and eliminating diseases has achieved brilliant results; last year, the province eliminated more than 80 million rats and sparrows, more than 4 million catties of mosquitoes and flies, treated more than 750,000 people for schistosomiasis, more than 1.47 million people for hookworm disease, more than 150,000 people for filariasis, and more than 120,000 people for malaria. Twenty-five cities and counties have emerged that have basically eliminated the four pests, forty-four cities and counties that have basically eliminated schistosomiasis, eighteen cities and counties that have basically eliminated hookworm disease, and five cities and counties that have basically eliminated filariasis, as well as Xiatian Village in Sheng County, where no infectious diseases have occurred for six years. Medical and health organizations, medical colleges, and pharmaceutical research institutions have also greatly developed, with more than 8,000 new hospitals, maternity hospitals, and health centers (stations) built, and more than 12,000 beds added, and great achievements have been made in maternal and child health, among other areas. In the work of traditional Chinese medicine and materia medica, after criticizing the idea of ​​belittling and discriminating against traditional Chinese medicine, especially after organizing all the province's medical and health personnel to study the CCP Central Committee's instructions on the Party Group report of the Ministry of Health on the class for Western medicine doctors leaving their posts to study traditional Chinese medicine and the Party Group report of the Ministry of Health, as well as relevant People's Daily editorials, the work of traditional Chinese medicine has taken on a new look. The province's traditional Chinese medicine team has grown from more than 8,000 in the early days of liberation to more than 18,000 now, and those with conditions for further study have been organized for full-time, on-the-job study, and correspondence courses for rotation training and education, developed more than 1,000 traditional Chinese medicine apprentices, and successively established and developed traditional Chinese medicine research institutes, traditional Chinese medicine hospitals, traditional Chinese medicine training schools, and traditional Chinese medicine outpatient clinics, and hospitals above the county level have generally established traditional Chinese medicine departments. Some counties and cities have also established traditional Chinese medicine specialized schools.
　　In the clinical cooperation between traditional Chinese and Western medicine, there have been many outstanding curative effects and experiences, such as the use of new formulas of insecticidal pills, liver and spleen swelling reduction pills, and motion sickness pills to treat schistosomiasis, with significant effects. Encephalitis B, which was originally more difficult to treat with Western medicine, is treated with traditional Chinese medicine gypsum Scrophularia mixture, Zhibao Dan, etc., with a cure rate of more than 90%; Yin Chen Hao Tang is used to treat infectious hepatitis, and Shugan San is used to treat chronic hepatitis, with curative effects of more than 80%; acupuncture and traditional Chinese medicine are used to treat appendicitis, which can be used without surgery, and many hospitals are promoting its use. For difficult and complicated diseases such as deafness and muteness, leukemia, purpura, aplastic anemia, acute poliomyelitis, cancer, cataracts, color blindness, and sudden blindness, traditional Chinese medicine doctors in our province are creating very good curative effects in treatment.
　　Through the great rectification movement and encouraged by the Party's traditional Chinese medicine policy, the traditional Chinese and Western medicine personnel throughout the province have developed from political and ideological unity to academic unity and cooperation, established the idea of serving production in everything, and many medical personnel have gone to the mountains and countryside, and to construction sites, and during the busy farming seasons of harvesting and planting, and fighting drought and flood prevention, have taken the initiative to go deep into the fields and construction sites to conduct mobile medical treatment, and many moving stories and advanced figures have emerged. In the movement to eliminate pests and diseases, they have liberated their minds, broken superstitions, established a communist style of daring to think, dare to speak, and dare to do, and launched a technical revolution upsurge of learning from the advanced, catching up with the advanced, and surpassing the advanced, creating many moving advanced deeds. Although I am not talented, I have also created Yangdan pills to treat tuberculosis, which have been tried in hospitals in neighboring provinces and our province, and have achieved significant results, and the masses have sent many letters of thanks and encouragement. At the same time, Danshi pills, which soothe the liver and clear the gallbladder, have been created, and are also quite successful in treating liver and gallbladder diseases, and the treatment of malignant tumors is being researched and tested. Western medicine doctors learning traditional Chinese medicine has set off a craze throughout the province. Popularizing acupuncture treatment, promoting traditional Chinese medicine single and effective prescriptions, learning traditional Chinese medicine theory, and applying traditional Chinese medicine and acupuncture to deal with antimony agents, Haitian, and other reactions have been very effective. In many places, Guanzhong decoction is used to treat hookworm disease, and Sanxiandan and Sanshengdan are used to treat venereal diseases. Hangzhou Infectious Disease Hospital uses traditional Chinese medicine Baitouweng decoction, Coptis chinensis, Purslane, tea, Chebula, etc. to treat dysentery, and the curative effect is very high. The Zhejiang Province Western Medicine Doctors Leaving Their Posts to Study Traditional Chinese Medicine class has already started, and the Hangzhou City Western Medicine Doctors On-the-Job Study Traditional Chinese Medicine class has been opened for the second term, and many medical colleges have opened traditional Chinese medicine courses. In order to better inherit and carry forward the ancestral medical heritage, many traditional Chinese medicine doctors are actively learning some basic knowledge of modern medicine.
　　Many places in our province have launched a campaign to collect folk remedies and visit virtuous people. The Wenzhou Prefectural Office has organized a visiting traditional Chinese medicine work group. Hangzhou City has so far collected more than 400,000 single, effective, and secret prescriptions. Traditional Chinese medicine doctors have contributed more than 1,000 copies of ancient hand-copied books, family secret books, and medical books. The health department of the Hangzhou Railway Bureau has also collected more than 40,000 prescriptions. Many of these are excellent prescriptions with good effects.
　　Our province's traditional Chinese medicine work has also achieved great results. In 1958, the output value of medicinal materials increased by 1.2 times compared with 1956. Zhejiang is a major medicinal material producing area in China, and its output, variety, and output value rank second in the country. Our province has also successively discovered precious and rare medicinal materials such as seahorse, hawksbill turtle, Coptis chinensis, and Fritillaria thunbergii. High-yielding fields of Zhejiang fritillary in Zhang'ao Township, Yinxian County, have emerged, with a yield of 906 catties per mu, exceeding the average yield per mu by 125%. The whole province has also mobilized the masses to grow medicinal materials, and cities have combined greening and beautification for planting. Many medical and health units have organized health personnel to plant traditional Chinese medicine experimental fields, participating in physical labor while better studying traditional Chinese medicine through practice. Various places in the province have launched activities to collect wild medicinal materials in the spring. For example, the Tianmu Mountain People's Commune organized commune members to dig more than 68,000 catties in six days. This year, the province plans to plant more than 350,000 mu of medicinal materials. Hangzhou City has opened a medicinal material planting farm of more than 8,000 mu, and has transferred more than 70 health personnel to conduct labor training there. It can be predicted that this year's traditional Chinese medicine production will achieve a great harvest, which will not only provide a strong material guarantee for the province's pest and disease elimination movement, but also can be sold abroad to increase national wealth.
　　1959 is a crucial year for three years of hard work to change the face of our country. I am determined to work hard with my comrades, under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, to go all out, aim high, and with the spirit of hard work, solid work, and skillful work, to strive to achieve this year's economic and cultural construction plan.
　　Now I would like to put forward the following immature opinions on medical and health aspects:
　　1. Thoroughly eliminate the four pests, cultivate the habit of loving cleanliness and paying attention to hygiene, and ensure the physical health of workers and peasants. For areas where the four pests have not been completely eliminated, they must be completely eradicated to eliminate disease vectors. Strengthen health publicity and education, and cultivate the habit of everyone loving cleanliness and everyone paying attention to hygiene. For the diseases that are most harmful to the people's health, we must continue to mobilize medical personnel and combine the strength of the masses to go all out to eliminate them. Strengthen physical exercise to ensure the physical health of the workers and peasants. I believe that to strengthen production and construction, we must first have a strong physique. Therefore, it is very necessary to carry out sports activities in rural areas and factories and enterprises. At present, government agencies, schools, hospitals, and some factories and enterprises have one or two broadcasts of exercises and other cultural and sports activities every day. However, some factories, enterprises, and rural areas have not fully carried them out. If everyone can engage in ten or twenty minutes of sports activities every morning, and properly arrange work breaks, and have a half-hour normal rest after lunch, they will be able to maintain a full spirit and work more vigorously, which will not only ensure physical health, but also ensure sustained labor production.
　　2. In order to protect people's health and accelerate socialist construction, traditional Chinese medicine must go all out, aim high, strengthen unity and cooperation between traditional Chinese and Western medicine, learn from each other's strengths, and complement each other's weaknesses, actively do a good job in clinical treatment, carry out scientific research on traditional Chinese medicine, and further improve the therapeutic effect. Help Western medicine doctors learn traditional Chinese medicine, do not exaggerate, do not be conservative, and teach all their experience to Western medicine doctors. The training of new forces should also be carried out more, faster, better, and more economically, and constantly improve teaching quality and teaching methods. In terms of teaching materials: The Inner Canon, Materia Medica, Treatise on Febrile Diseases, and Synopsis of the Golden Chamber are all classics of traditional Chinese medicine and should be well studied. In addition, there are also the works of various schools of thought in the past dynasties, such as Wang Shuhe's Pulse Classic of the Jin Dynasty, Chao Yuanfang's General Treatise on the Causes and Symptoms of Various Diseases of the Sui Dynasty, Sun Simiao's Prescriptions Worth a Thousand Gold of the Tang Dynasty, Wang Tao's Secret Essentials of the Outer Terrace, as well as the Four Great Masters of the Jin and Yuan Dynasties and Compendium of Materia Medica, Supplement to the Compendium of Materia Medica, Treatise on Materia Medica, Treatise on Warm Diseases, Differentiation of Warm Diseases, and Treatise on Warm Heat, etc., which have been developed from generation to generation. Not only should we dabble in these literatures, but we should also be familiar with them. They should also be translated into popular reading materials so that scholars can easily accept them.
　　3. Develop the production of traditional Chinese medicinal materials to meet the needs of medical treatment. First of all, it is recommended that all localities, under the leadership of Party committees and governments at all levels, conduct a serious inspection of the implementation of the State Council's "Instructions on Issues Concerning the Development of Traditional Chinese Medicinal Material Production" to promote the implementation of medicinal material production plans so that they can take root, and while ensuring the production of grain, cotton, oil, and hemp, attach importance to medicinal material production. Secondly, in addition to specific plans, government agencies, schools, troops, and hospitals are required to make full use of gaps to plant medicinal materials. Actively mobilize the masses to start land reclamation, combining afforestation, greening, beautification, fragrant planting, and collection of medicinal materials to increase the source of medicinal materials and meet the needs.
　　The above is my humble opinion, which is not comprehensive enough. Please help correct me, fellow representatives and relevant units. Finally, I wish the conference a complete success and all representatives good health.

　　浙江医药卫生事业大有进展
    叶熙春代表的发言主席、各位代表：
    我连日来听了国务院周恩来总理的政府工作报告，和李富春、李先念副总理以及彭真副委员长的报告后，感到莫大的鼓舞，我衷心热烈拥护。
    正当我们全国人民在党的领导下，满怀信心地为实现1959年更大、更好、更全面的跃进而团结奋斗的时候，英帝国主义和印度野心分子竟然策动一小撮西藏上层反动集团公开发动武装叛乱，分裂我们伟大祖国的统一，我对此表示无比的愤怒。我们要严正警告英帝国主义者和印度野心分子：西藏是中国的领土，决不容许他人染指！西藏事件完全是中国的内政，决不容许任何人进行干涉。印度扩张主义分子好像忘记了印度过去受英帝国主义殖民统治的惨痛历史，居然从英帝国主义那里继承了一付不光彩的衣钵。但是，他们应当知道：伟大的中国人民是不好欺负的，一切干涉者和野心家是决不会有好下场的！
    我是一个普通的中医师，能当选全国人民代表，参加这样的大会，这完全是党和毛主席以及人民给中医界的光荣和信任。因此既是惭感交加，又是无比兴奋。
    我们浙江省的卫生事业，在党的正确领导下，和全国各地一样，取得了巨大的成就，出现了大跃进的局面。以除四害、讲卫生、消灭疾病为中心的爱国卫生运动，取得辉煌的战果；去年全省消灭鼠雀八千多万只，蚊蝇四百余万斤，治疗血吸虫病七十五万多人，钩虫病一百四十七万多人，血丝虫病十五万多人，疟疾十二万多人。出现了二十五个基本消灭四害的市、县，四十四个基本消灭血吸虫病的市、县，十八个基本消灭钩虫病的市、县，五个基本消灭血丝虫病的市、县，还有六年没有发生传染病的嵊县下田村。医疗保健组织，医学院校和医药研究机构也有很大发展，新建医院、产院、保健所（站）八千多个，增加病床一万二千多张，在妇幼卫生等方面都有很大成绩。在中医、中药工作方面，经过批判轻视歧视中医思想，特别是组织全省医药卫生人员学习了中共中央对卫生部党组关于西医离职学习中医班的报告的批示和卫生部党组的报告，以及人民日报有关社论后，使中医药工作出现了新的面貌。全省的中医队伍已由解放初期的八千余名，发展到现在的一万八千余名，并且对有进修条件的中医，组织了脱产、在职学习和函授进修轮训等培养教育，发展了一千余名中医学徒，先后成立和发展了中医药研究所、中医院、中医进修学校、中医门诊部，县以上的医院普设了中医科。有些县市还成立了中医专科学校。
    在中西医临床合作上，有不少突出的疗效和经验，如用新方杀虫丸、肝脾消肿丸、舟车丸等治疗血吸虫病，疗效显著。原来西医治疗比较困难的乙型脑炎，用中药石膏扁斛合剂，至宝丹等治疗，治愈率在百分之九十以上；茵陈蒿汤治疗传染性肝炎，舒肝散治疗慢性肝炎，疗效都在百分之八十以上；针灸和中药治疗阑尾炎，可不用手术，已有不少医院在推广使用。对于聋哑、白血病、紫瘢病、再生不良性贫血、急性灰白质炎、癌症、白内障、色盲、暴盲等疑难杂症，我省中医都在治疗中创造了很好疗效。
    全省的中西医务人员，通过伟大的整风运动和在党的中医政策的鼓舞下，中西医之间从政治思想上的团结发展到学术上的团结合作，树立了一切为生产服务的思想，不少医务人员上山下乡，下工地，在抢收抢种、抗旱防涝等农忙季节，主动深入田间工地进行巡回医疗，出现不少动人事迹和先进人物。在除害灭病运动中，解放了思想，破除了迷信，树立了敢想，敢说、敢做的共产主义风格，掀起了学先进、赶先进、比先进的技术革命高潮，创造了很多动人的先进事迹。我虽不才，也创用了羊胆丸治疗肺结核病，经邻省及本省各医院试用，取得显著效果，群众寄来不少感谢鼓励信。同时创造了疏肝清胆的胆实丸，对于治疗肝胆病，也相当成功，对恶性肿瘤的治疗正在研究试治之中。西医学习中医，全省已掀起了热潮。普及针灸治疗，推行中医单验方，学习中医药理论，应用中药和针灸处理锑剂、海群生等反应有很大成效。不少地方用贯众汤治钩虫病，三仙丹、三升丹治性病，杭州市传染病院用中药白头翁汤、黄连、马齿苋、茶叶、西青果等治疗痢疾，疗效都很高。浙江省西医离职学习中医班已经开学，杭州市西医在职学习中医班已开办了第二期，许多医学院校开设了中医课程。为了更好地继承发扬祖国医药遗产，不少中医正在积极学习一些现代医学的基本知识。
    我省有不少地方已开展了采风访贤运动，温州专署组织了访问中医工作团，杭州市到目前已采到单、验、秘方四十多万张，中医师献出古传抄本、家传秘本和医药书籍一千多部，杭州铁路局卫生部门也已采方四万多张。其中有不少是效果良好的锦方。
    我省中药工作亦有很大成绩，一九五八年药材产值比一九五六年增加一点二倍。浙江是我国药材主要产地，产量、品种、产值在全国是第二位，我省还陆续发现了海龙、海马、玳瑁、黄连、坪贝等名贵稀有药材。出现了如鄞县樟岙乡浙贝高产田，亩产九百零六斤，超过平均亩产百分之一百二十五。全省还发动群众大种药材，城市结合绿化美化进行种植。不少医药卫生单位组织卫生人员种了中药试验田，一面参加体力劳动，一面更好地通过实践研究学习中医药。全省各地在春季开展了采挖野生药材活动，如天目山人民公社组织了社员，六天就挖掘了六万八千多斤。今年全省计划种药三十五万多亩，杭州市开辟了一个八千多亩的药物种植场，并抽调了七十余个卫生人员在那里进行劳动锻炼。可以预计，今年的中药生产，将会取得巨大丰收，这些不仅对全省除害灭病运动，提供有力的物质保证。同时还可以行销国外，增加国家财富。
    一九五九年是苦战三年，改变我国面貌，具有决定性意义的一年。我坚决和同志们一起，在党和毛主席的领导下，鼓足干劲，力争上游，以苦干实干巧干的精神，为实现今年的经济文化建设计划而奋斗。
    现在我对医药卫生方面提出以下几个不成熟的意见：
    一、彻底消灭四害，培养爱清洁讲卫生的习惯，保证工农身体健康。对四害还没有除尽的地区，必须彻底予以根除，以杜绝病媒。加强卫生宣传教育，培养人人爱清洁，个个讲卫生的习惯。对危害人民身体健康最严重的疾病，要继续发动医务人员，结合群众力量，全力以赴加以消灭。加强体育锻炼，保证工农群众的身体健康。我认为要加强生产建设，首先要有强壮的体格。因此，开展农村和工厂企业的体育活动甚为必要。目前机关、学校、医院和部分工厂企业每天都有一到二次的广播操和其他的文体活动。但是有些工厂企业和农村还没有全面地开展起来，如果大家每天早晨能搞一、二十分钟的体育活动，并适当安排工间操，午膳后有半小时的正常休息，这样就能保持精神饱满，劳动更加有劲，既保证身体健康，又保证持久性的劳动生产。
    二、为了保障人民健康，加速社会主义建设，中医必须鼓足干劲，力争上游，加强中西医之间的团结合作，同西医互相学习各取其所长，各补其所短，积极搞好临床治疗，开展中医药的科学研究，进一步提高医疗效果。帮助西医学习中医，不虚夸，不保守，把自己所有的经验全部教给西医。对新生力量的培养，也要多、快、好、省地进行，不断提高教学质量，改进教学方法。教材方面：对内经、本草经、伤寒论、金匮要略都是中医的经史，应当很好地学习。此外还有诸子百家历代各家著作，如晋王叔和的脉经，隋巢元方的诸病源候总论，唐孙思邈的千金方，王焘的外台秘要，以及金元四大家和本草纲目，本草拾遗，本草述，温热论、温病条辨、温热经纬等等，代代有所发挥，对这些文献不仅涉猎，也应谙熟。并译成通俗读物，使学者容易接受。
    三、发展中药材生产，满足医疗用药需要，首先建议各地对国务院“关于发展中药材生产问题的指示”的执行情况，在各级党和政府的领导下，认真进行一次检查，以促进药材生产规划做到落脚生根，在保证粮、棉、油、麻生产的同时，重视药材生产。其次除去具体规划外，要求机关、学校、部队、医院尽量利用隙地种植药材。积极发动群众，大家动起手来进行开荒，结合造林、绿化、美化、香化种植和采集药材，以增加药源，达到满足需要。
    以上一管之见，不够全面，请各位代表和有关单位帮助指正。最后庆祝大会胜利成功，各位代表身体健康。
