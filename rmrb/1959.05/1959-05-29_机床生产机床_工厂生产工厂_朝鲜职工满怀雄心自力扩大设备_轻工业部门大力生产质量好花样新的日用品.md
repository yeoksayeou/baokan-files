Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang:  Korean mechanical industry workers, responding to the call of the Korean Workers' Party to produce more than one new machine tool for every existing machine tool on average, are further expanding the movement to build machine tools themselves.

Now, large and small machine tool factories and workshops with cutting machine tools throughout northern Korea are participating in this movement under the slogan "Machine Tools Produce Machine Tools, Factories Produce Factories."

This self-reliant machine tool manufacturing movement began at the beginning of this year in various factories, and in the first quarter of this year, more than 1,700 various machine tools were manufactured.

The workers of the largest machine tool factory in northern Korea, the Heechon Machine Tool Factory, in addition to completing their task of producing 3,000 machine tools this year, will also build a machine tool factory with an annual output of 1,000 machine tools before "August 15th" of next year. This factory will be built in Pyongyang. The workers of the Heechon Machine Tool Factory will manufacture hundreds of machine tools, such as lathes, planers, and radial drilling machines, as well as many pieces of equipment, such as cranes and air compressors, for it.

The workers of the Hamhung Machinery Manufacturing Plant will manufacture 500 various machine tools this year. Technical personnel from more than 100 large and small factories in South Pyongan Province recently held a meeting and formulated a plan to manufacture 1,956 various machine tools this year.

The workers of the West Chosen Coal Mine Machinery Factory have even greater ambitions. They are determined to have each machine tool produce ten new machine tools this year, and the entire factory will build 330 various machine tools this year. A workshop in a Pyongyang factory with only two machine tools has decided to build twenty lathes and drilling machines this year.

The workers of the "Democratic Korea Daily" printing press have also joined this movement. They recently built a rotary printing press that runs at 400 revolutions per minute.

Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 26th:  Workers in the light industry sector of North Korea, responding to the call of the Central Committee of the Korean Workers' Party at its February plenary session regarding improving product quality, are striving to reach the level of advanced countries for 60% of light industrial products within this year.

In the first few months of this year, workers in the light industry sector have already made significant achievements in various aspects. Workers in various textile factories have produced more and better fabrics. The proportion of first-class products in the cotton fabrics they produced in the first few months of this year increased by 20% compared to last year. In addition, they also produced various patterned rayon fabrics and fabrics blended with rayon and cocoon silk. Workers in various ceramic factories have produced finer, thinner, and more colorful porcelain this year. They have also restored the production of internationally renowned Goryeo porcelain, using traditional techniques such as the three-inlay method to fire Goryeo celadon with antique colors and unique patterns. The Nampo Glass Factory, newly built after the war, also produced high-end products such as carved glass utensils this year. The new-style raincoats and rain shoes made of silk and rubber by the Pyongyang Rubber Factory have also been well-received by customers in the market. This factory has also recently successfully trial-produced automobile tires.

In order to improve product quality and expand the variety, trial production workshops have been universally established in various factories in the light industry sector. Outstanding technical personnel and workers have been concentrated, rationalization proposals from various aspects have been widely absorbed, advanced production technologies have been absorbed, and high-quality, new-style products have been trial-produced. After successful trial production, they are promoted. From the beginning of this year to April, various factories have successfully trial-produced more than 500 new products, and more than 300 of them have been put into production.

    朝鲜职工满怀雄心自力扩大设备
    轻工业部门大力生产质量好花样新的日用品
    据新华社平壤讯　朝鲜机械工业部门的职工，响应朝鲜劳动党提出的平均每台机床生产一台以上的新机床的号召，进一步广泛开展自造机床的运动。
    现在，朝鲜北部各地大大小小的机床厂和具有切削机床的车间都在“机床生产机床、工厂生产工厂”的口号下投入了这个运动。
    这个自造机床的运动，从今年年初就已在各厂展开，今年第一季度就造了一千七百多台各种机床。
    朝鲜北部最大的机床厂——熙川机床厂的职工们除了要完成今年生产三千台机床的任务以外，还要在明年“八·一五”以前生产一座年产一千台机床的机床厂。这个厂将建设在平壤。熙川机床厂的职工要为它制造车床、刨床、摇臂钻床等数百台机床和起重机、空气压缩机等许多设备。
    咸兴机械制造所的职工们要在今年内制造各种机床五百台。平安南道的一百多个大小工厂的技术人员最近举行会议时，制订了今年制造一千九百五十六台各种机床的计划。
    西鲜煤矿机械厂的工人们雄心更大，他们决心要在今年内使每一台机床生产出十台新机床，全厂今年自造了三百三十台各种工作机械。平壤一个工厂的只有两台机床的车间决定今年要自造二十台车床和钻床。
    “民主朝鲜报”的印刷所的工人们也投入了这个运动，他们最近自造了一台每分钟四百转的轮转印报机。
    新华社平壤26日电　朝鲜轻工业部门的职工响应朝鲜劳动党中央今年二月全会关于提高产品质量的号召，正在为达到在今年内使60％的轻工业产品赶上先进国家的水平而努力。
    在今年头几个月内，轻工业部门的职工已经在各方面取得了显著的成就。各纺织厂的工人生产出了更多更好的布匹，在他们今年头几个月生产的棉布中，一等品所占的比例比去年增加了20％；此外，他们还生产了各种花色品种的人造丝织物以及人造丝和茧丝混纺的织物。各陶瓷器厂的工人今年生产出了更细更薄、花色繁多的瓷器，他们还恢复了国际闻名的高丽瓷器的生产，用三嵌法等传统手艺烧制出色彩古雅，花纹别致的高丽青瓷。战后新建的南浦玻璃厂今年还生产了镂化玻璃器皿等高级产品。平壤橡胶厂用丝绸和橡胶生产的新式雨衣、新式雨鞋在市场上也受到了广大顾客的欢迎。这个厂最近还试制成功汽车轮胎。
    为了提高产品的质量和扩大品种，轻工业部门各厂都普遍成立了试制品车间，集中了优秀的技术人员和工人，广泛吸取各方面的合理化建议，吸收先进的生产技术，试制质量好、花色新的产品，试制成功后再加以推广。从今年年初到4月份为止，各厂已经试制成功五百多种新产品，其中的三百多种已经投入生产。
