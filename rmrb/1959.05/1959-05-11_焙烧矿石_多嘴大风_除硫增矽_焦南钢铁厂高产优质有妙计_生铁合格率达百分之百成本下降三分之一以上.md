Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 10th - Adopting a method of "intensive cultivation and meticulous work" in the ironmaking process of small blast furnaces can guarantee high yield and quality. This is a successful experience of the Jiaonan Steel Plant in Henan Province.

The more than 11,000 tons of iron produced by this plant from January to April this year had an average sulfur content of below 0.07%, with a 100% qualification rate, all meeting the requirements for making good steel and casting machine parts.

Since the Jiaonan Steel Plant was put into production, iron production has gradually increased. However, the quality of iron was not high in the past. The average sulfur content of iron produced in the fourth quarter of last year was above 0.18%, and some reached 0.25%. The main reason was that some people believed that high yield and high quality were contradictory, "high yield cannot be high quality, high quality cannot be high yield." Based on this situation, the factory Party committee believed that to achieve the requirements of high yield and high quality, it was necessary to first solve ideological problems and unify the understanding of high yield and high quality among employees. Therefore, the masses of employees were mobilized to launch extensive discussions and debates on the issue of "can high yield be high quality?" As a result of the debate, it was unanimously believed that the previous disregard for the height of the furnace temperature, the intensity of smelting, the simple pursuit of high yield by adding more materials to the furnace and desperately increasing the load, was the crux of the problem that high yield could not be high quality. Subsequently, the employees put forward 1,532 rationalization proposals, which included advanced experiences from the plant and other places. These can be summarized as: roasting ore, "chatty" combustion, increasing air volume, small meals and frequent feeding, separate particle charging and desulfurization and silicon enrichment. After joint discussions and research, the plant leaders, engineering technicians and workers designated these good methods as the operating procedures and systems for "intensive cultivation and meticulous work" in the blast furnace, and conscientiously implemented them in the smelting process.

In terms of furnace charge management, in addition to roasting before entering the furnace, they also take into account the characteristics of small blast furnaces such as short body and weak force, short smelting cycle, difficult-to-melt ore, and easy-to-cool hearth, the particle size of ore and coke is reduced by half, and the method of small batches and frequent additions is adopted, so that the four types of small blast furnaces ranging from eight to fifty-four cubic meters can eat small meals frequently and chew carefully. This makes the material more permeable in the furnace and easier to melt, and the thermal energy utilization rate of gas is higher than in the past. In terms of increasing air volume and raising furnace temperature, they adopted the method of multiple machines in parallel, connecting the three blowers and three hot blast stoves previously used for the 54-cubic-meter blast furnace in parallel to concentrate air supply, so that the air temperature is always maintained above 600 degrees.

In addition, they also established a set of testing systems for furnace charges and products. Furnace charges are tested before entering the furnace, and strict chemical analysis is performed on the iron and slag flowing from each furnace.

After adopting the above meticulous and solid technical measures, the Jiaonan Steel Plant not only guaranteed the quality of iron, but also increased its output step by step, increasing from more than 70 tons per day in January to more than 160 tons per day in April. At the same time, labor productivity has also been greatly improved compared with the past, and costs have also been reduced by more than one-third compared with the past.

    焙烧矿石　多嘴大风　除硫增矽
    焦南钢铁厂高产优质有妙计
    生铁合格率达百分之百成本下降三分之一以上
    新华社郑州10日电　在小高炉的炼铁过程中采用“精耕细作”的办法，可以保证高产优质，这是河南省焦南钢铁厂的一个成功的经验。
    这个厂今年1到4月份所产的一万一千多吨铁，含硫量平均在0.07％以下，合格率占百分之百，全部达到能炼好钢、能铸造机件的要求。
    焦南钢铁厂自投入生产以来，铁的产量逐渐上升。但是过去铁的质量不够高，去年第四季度生产的铁含硫量平均在0.18％以上，高的达到0.25％。追其原因，主要的是有些人认为高产和优质有矛盾，“高产不能优质，优质不能高产”。厂党委根据这种情况，认为要达到高产优质的要求，必须首先解决思想问题，统一职工对高产优质的认识。于是便发动职工群众，针对“高产能不能优质”的问题，广泛地展开了鸣放和辩论。辩论结果，一致认为过去的不顾炉温高低，冶炼强度如何，单纯为了高产而多向炉内加料和拼命提高负荷，是高产不能优质的症结所在。随后，职工们提出了一千五百三十二条合理化建议，这些建议有本厂的、也有外地的先进经验，归纳起来就是：焙烧矿石、多嘴燃烧、加大风量、少吃多餐、分粒入炉和除硫增矽。厂里的领导干部、工程技术人员和工人，经过共同讨论研究以后，把这些好办法定为高炉“精耕细作”的操作规程和制度，在冶炼过程中认真加以贯彻。
    在炉料管理方面，除了入炉前必须经过焙烧以外，他们还根据小高炉身短力弱、冶炼周期短、矿石难熔化、炉缸容易凉等特点，把矿石、焦炭的粒度缩小一半，并且采用小批勤上的办法，使八到五十四立方公尺的四种小高炉少吃多餐、细嚼细咽。这样就使料入炉内透气性大，比较容易熔化，瓦斯的热能利用率比过去提高。在加大风量提高炉温方面，他们采取了多机并联的办法，把以前供给五十四立方公尺高炉用的三台鼓风机和三个热风炉，并联起来集中送风，使风温经常保持在六百度以上。
    此外，他们还建立了一套对炉料和产品的化验制度，炉料在入炉以前都经过化验，对于每个炉子流出的铁和渣都进行严格的化学分析。
    焦南钢铁厂采取以上细致扎实的技术措施以后，不仅保证了铁的质量，而且产量也步步上升，今年1月份日产七十多吨，4月份提高到日产一百六十多吨。同时，劳动生产效率也比过去大大提高，成本也比过去降低三分之一以上。
