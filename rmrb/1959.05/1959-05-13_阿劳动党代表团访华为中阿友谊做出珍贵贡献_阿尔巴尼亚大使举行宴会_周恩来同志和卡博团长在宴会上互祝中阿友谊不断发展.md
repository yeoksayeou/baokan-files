Xinhua News Agency, 12th - Albanian Ambassador to China, P. Balili, held a banquet at the embassy tonight for the Albanian Labor Party delegation's visit to China.

    Vice-Chairman of the CPC Central Committee, Zhou Enlai, attended the banquet and delivered a speech.

    Those present at the banquet included General Secretary of the CPC Central Committee, Deng Xiaoping, members of the Political Bureau, Li Xiannian, Secretaries of the Secretariat, Wang Jiaxiang, Alternate Secretary, Yang Shangkun, Central Committee members, Wu Xiuquan, Zeng Shan, alternate Central Committee members, Liao Luyan, Jiang Nanxiang, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, Ji Pengfei, Vice Minister of Culture, Xia Yan, and responsible staff members from the organs of the CPC Central Committee.

    Head of the Albanian Labor Party delegation, member of the Political Bureau of the Party Central Committee, and Secretary of the Central Secretariat, Hysni Kapo, spoke at the banquet. He said that throughout history, the Albanian people have struggled for the independence and freedom of their motherland for generations, but they have never escaped the oppression and rule of foreign aggressors and imperialism. Only with the leadership of the Labor Party and by standing together with the Soviet Union and the Soviet people did the Albanian people's struggle achieve victory.

    Comrade Kapo said that although the Albanian people are surrounded by enemies, they are not isolated. We are victoriously building socialism. We have the strength to deliver a powerful counterattack to any enemy who invades us. The reason we have such strength is because we have great Marxism-Leninism, and the great friendship and unity of the socialist camp countries headed by the Soviet Union.

    In his speech, Comrade Kapo sternly condemned the Yugoslav revisionists for their consistently vile sabotage activities against the Albanian Party and state. Comrade Kapo said that in the face of the unity and friendship of our great socialist camp, the Yugoslav revisionists and all enemies will be smashed to pieces.

    Comrade Zhou Enlai said in his speech that before the October Revolution, the Albanian people were in an isolated position in history, but they carried out unyielding struggles for a long time. After the October Revolution, the Albanian people had the leadership of the Party, and now they stand together with the one billion people of the socialist camp, and the victory of the Albanian people's cause is guaranteed.

    Comrade Zhou Enlai said that Albania and China are far apart, but the Chinese people are very concerned about and admire the struggle of the Albanian people. Comrade Zhou Enlai, on behalf of the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese government, and the Chinese people, thanked the delegation for its visit and hoped that the delegation would bring back to Albania the Chinese Party's, government's, and people's admiration and support for the Albanian Party and people.

    In his speech at the beginning of the banquet, Ambassador Balili said that the friendship and unity between our two countries' parties and peoples, based on the immortal ideas of Marxism-Leninism, are developing and strengthening day by day. The Albanian Labor Party delegation's visit has made a new and valuable contribution to the development of friendship between Albania and China.

    At the banquet, the hosts and guests repeatedly raised their glasses to wish for the constant development of the eternal friendship between the parties and peoples of China and Albania, and to wish for the further consolidation of the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union.

    新华社12日讯  阿尔巴尼亚驻华大使巴利里为阿尔巴尼亚劳动党代表团访问中国，今天晚间在大使馆举行宴会。
    中共中央副主席周恩来出席宴会并且讲了话。
    出席宴会的，有中共中央总书记邓小平，政治局委员李先念，书记处书记王稼祥、候补书记杨尚昆，中央委员伍修权、曾山，候补中央委员廖鲁言、蒋南翔，外交部副部长姬鹏飞，文化部副部长夏衍，以及中共中央机关负责工作人员等。
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党代表团团长、党中央政治局委员、中央书记处书记希斯尼·卡博在宴会上讲话。他说，在历史上，阿尔巴尼亚人民为了自己祖国的独立和自由，世世代代都进行着斗争，但是他们从来没有摆脱外国侵略者和帝国主义的压迫和统治。只有在有了劳动党的领导，并且依靠苏联和苏联人民站在一起的时候，阿尔巴尼亚人民的斗争才取得了胜利。
    卡博同志说，阿尔巴尼亚人民虽然处在敌人的包围之中，但是它不是孤立的。我们正在胜利地建设社会主义。我们有力量给任何侵犯我们的敌人以强有力的回击。我们所以有这样的力量，这是因为我们有伟大的马克思列宁主义，有以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国的伟大友谊和团结。
    卡博同志在讲话中严正谴责南斯拉夫修正主义者对阿尔巴尼亚党和国家一贯进行的各种卑鄙的破坏活动。卡博同志说，在我们伟大的社会主义阵营的团结与友谊面前，南斯拉夫修正主义者和一切敌人都将碰得头破血流。
    周恩来同志讲话说，十月革命以前，阿尔巴尼亚人民在历史上处在孤立的地位，但是它们长期地进行了不屈不挠的斗争。十月革命以后，阿尔巴尼亚人民有了党的领导，现在又同社会主义阵营十亿人民站在一起，阿尔巴尼亚人民的事业的胜利就有了保证。
    周恩来同志说，阿尔巴尼亚和中国相距很远，但是中国人民十分关怀和钦佩阿尔巴尼亚人民的斗争。周恩来同志代表中国共产党、中国政府和中国人民感谢代表团的这次访问，并且希望代表团把中国党、政府和人民对阿尔巴尼亚党和人民的钦佩和支持，带回阿尔巴尼亚。
    巴利里大使在宴会开始时的讲话中说，以不朽的马克思列宁主义思想为基础的我们两国的党和人民之间的友谊和团结，正在日益发展巩固。阿尔巴尼亚劳动党代表团的这次访问，对发展阿中两国的友谊作出了新的珍贵的贡献。
    在宴会上，宾主一再举杯祝中国和阿尔巴尼亚两国党和人民之间的永恒的友谊不断发展，祝以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结更加巩固。（附图片）
