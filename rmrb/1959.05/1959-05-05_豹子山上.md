    Leopard Mountain

    In the afternoon, Lao Zhou and I set off with our weapons to find wasteland in the primeval forest to the east. Our farm needed to seize the season to plant peanuts, so we needed to find new reclamation areas. We crossed jungles, traversed terraced fields, and found a sparkling large ditch deep in the forest; climbing up along the north side of the ditch, we discovered a small hill covered with Eupatorium and mixed trees. The perennial Eupatorium in the border area is as tall and dense as a shrub. We used a lot of effort to climb and scramble before we reached the top of the small hill. At the northern end of the hilltop, there was a Dai-style hut. The steep slope to the northeast of the hut had been burned by the villagers as lazy-fire land for planting dry rice and cotton. Standing on the top of the hill and looking west, the entire Menglong territory was before our eyes. The setting sun reflected the shadow of the pagoda on the western hilltop, and the Dai villages were scattered among the golden rice fields and tall coconut and bodhi trees, the scenery was truly beautiful. At our feet, all around the mountain, for several miles were Eupatorium fields. Comrade Zhou Defu and I grabbed a handful of soil to look at, it was loose black oily sandy soil, exactly the peanut land we were looking for. We were very happy and decided to choose this area as the new reclamation area for our second team.
    After returning to the team, I left for more than twenty days due to other work. When I came back, as soon as I stepped in the door, Lao Zhou greeted me and said, "Leopard Mountain has been opened up, and more than fifty mu of peanuts have been planted. The branch decided to send you to live on the mountain with the second group." Leopard Mountain, what place is this? I was at a loss. Comrade Zhou Defu saw my appearance and said with a smile, "Have you forgotten? It's the wasteland we found last time!" I didn't bother to answer, shouldered my luggage and raincoat, and took a hoe to go up the mountain with him. The second time I went up the mountain, the situation was very different. The area around the Shandong South Ditch was originally a place where Eupatorium grew, but now it has become a wide area. The newly turned black oily sandy soil exuded the fragrance of soil under the scorching sun, and the planted peanuts had already grown tender green sprouts; the thatched hut on the top of the mountain had also added a room. In the evening, I asked the comrades why they called this mountain Leopard Mountain. They told me that there were the most leopards in this place. When they first came, they found many leopard footprints; not far from this work shed, they also found a pile of sambar deer bones that had just been eaten by leopards. At night, the leopards even came to hum next to our work shed.
    We settled down on this Leopard Mountain. The male comrades opened four or five fen of land a day, and the female comrades also had to open more than three fen. When planting peanuts, a mixed-gender group of four people planted five mu a day. One comrade proposed at a group meeting that he wanted to dig two mu of land a day and win the first place in land reclamation for the whole farm. Everyone supported his bold and courageous action plan. The next day, he got up before dawn and went. Although it was raining and sunny that day, he kept digging non-stop. He dug with his hoe with a whooshing sound, one hoe loosened, and the second hoe was added to dig vigorously. The comrades brought him water and food, but he didn't even bother to drink it. By the time he finished digging in the evening, he had indeed opened up two mu and one fen and four li without fail. As a result, a new collective land reclamation and sowing competition was launched one wave higher than another. In less than half a month, the wasteland in front and behind Leopard Mountain had become peanut fields, and we launched an attack on a new goal. The bushes and Eupatorium fields west of the mountain were designated as our new reclamation area. Under our shining parangs, the Eupatorium and mixed forests fell down in front of us piece by piece. In the evening, when we set fire to the dried Eupatorium, the roaring fire reflected the red faces of the reclaimers, and the crackling sound startled the birds and beasts in the nearby primeval forest to flee everywhere, while we sang loudly in the posture of victors!
    On Leopard Mountain, the work was tense, and life was also very happy. Deer often came to graze on the green grass slope opposite us, but we ambushed them several times without hitting them. In the rainy season, chicken fungus (fragrant mushroom) could be picked everywhere in the newly reclaimed land that we had dug up. Plowing the land, pulling firewood, and picking up chicken fungus, even relieving oneself could yield chicken fungus, so we could eat chicken fungus soup and stir-fried chicken fungus with green chili peppers almost every day. Both sides of the large ditch along the mountain are covered with bamboo forests, and the mountainous area extending towards the border is even full of bamboo. One person only needs to spend two hours to carry back a large load of bamboo shoots, so fresh bamboo shoots with glutinous rice are often our good food. At the end of the wasteland is the villagers' pineapple mountain, and the villagers often cut pineapples to sell. We also planted twenty pineapple seedlings next to the work shed with the pineapple seedlings we cut. Whenever we finished working, we jumped into the sparkling large ditch in groups to take a clear water bath. On holiday evenings, we played the accordion and sang, and our fatigue disappeared with the singing.
    The wasteland was conquered piece by piece under our feet, and the peanuts also grew up piece by piece. By August, when the Michelia flowers were fragrant, the entire Leopard Mountain had become a peanut mountain full of yellow flowers.

    豹子山上
    严屏
    下午，我和老周带着武器出发到东面的原始森林中去找荒地。我们的农场，要抢节令种花生，需要找新的垦区。我们穿过丛林，跨过梯田，在森林的深处找到一条波光闪闪的大水沟；沿着水沟的北面爬上去，发现了一座长满粪箕草和杂树林的小山。边疆多年生的粪箕草，高大浓密得像灌木丛一样。我们费了很大的力气连爬带攀才钻到小山顶上。山顶北端有一个傣族盖的小窝铺，窝铺东北的陡坡已被老乡放火烧光作为种旱谷和棉花的懒火地了。我们站在山顶上往西一看，整个勐龙境都在我们的眼前。夕阳映照着西边山顶的塔影，在那一片片金色的稻田和高大的椰子树和菩提树之间星罗棋布地安排着傣族的村房，景色真是美妙极了。我们的脚下，环山周围，方圆几里都是粪箕草地。我和周德符同志抓了两把土看看，是松软的黑油沙土，正是我们要找的花生地。我们高兴得很，决定选这一片地作为我们二队的新垦区。
    回队以后，我因为别的工作离开了二十多天。回来时，刚一踏进门，老周就迎上来对我说：“豹子山已经开出来了，花生播下了五十多亩。支部决定派你参加二组住到山上去。”豹子山，这是什么地方，我茫然了。周德符同志看到我的样子，笑着说：“你忘了吗？就是我们上次找到的那片荒地呀！”我顾不得答话，扛上行李和蓑衣，拿着锄头，就和他一块上山去了。第二次上山，情形已经大不同了。山东南大水沟一带原是粪箕草丛生的地方，现在已经成了一片阔地，新翻的黑油沙土在烈日的曝晒下喷发着泥土的芳香，播下的花生已经长出了嫩绿的小芽；山头的茅草窝铺，也增加了一间了。晚上，我问同志们为什么把这山称为豹子山，他们告诉我，这地方豹子顶多。才来时，发现很多豹子脚印；在离这工棚不远的地方还发现一堆刚被豹子吃过的马鹿骨头，晚上豹子还来我们工棚旁边哼呢。
    我们就在这豹子山上安家落户了。男同志一天开四、五分地，女同志也要开三分以上。种花生，男女混合的四人小组，一天就播了五亩。有一个同志在小组会上提出他要一天挖二亩地，夺取全场开荒的第一把交椅。大家都支持他这个大胆而勇敢的行动计划。第二天，天还没亮他就起身去了，虽然那天时雨时晴，但他一刻也不停地挖，只见他的锄头呼呼地挖得风响，一把锄头松了，第二把又补充上去，一股劲地猛挖，同志们给他送水送饭他都顾不上喝，挖到晚上，他果真不折不扣地开了两亩一分四。于是新的集体开荒和播种竞赛又一浪高一浪地掀起来了。不上半月，豹子山前后的荒地都变成了花生地，我们又向新的目标发起了攻击，山头以西的灌木丛和粪箕草地都划作了我们的新垦区。在我们闪亮的?刀下，又只见那些粪箕草和杂木林一片一片地在我们的面前倒了下来。晚上，当我们放火烧掉那些已经晒干的粪箕草时，熊熊的大火映照着垦荒者红红的脸，那哔哔剥剥的响声，惊得附近原始森林中的鸟兽四处奔逃，而我们却以胜利者的姿态在引吭高歌！
    在豹子山，劳动很紧张，生活也顶愉快。在我们对面的青草坡上，鹿子常来吃草，可惜伏袭了它好几次都没有打中。雨季里，那些被我们挖翻的新垦地里，鸡棕（香菌）随处可以拾到，?地拉柴拾着鸡棕，解手也拾着鸡棕，因此喝鸡棕汤、青辣子炒鸡棕的可口野菜，我们差不多天天都能吃到。沿山大沟的两边都长着漫天的大竹林，向国境线延伸的一边山区，更是满山遍野的竹子，一个人只消去两个钟头就可以搬回来一大挑笋，所以鲜竹笋伴糯米饭也经常是我们的好食粮。荒地的尽头就是老乡的菠萝山，老乡经常砍菠萝来卖，我们还用砍下的菠萝秧在工棚旁边，种了二十棵菠萝。每当我们劳动完毕的时候，我们就成群地跳入波光闪闪的大水沟中去洗个清水澡，假日的傍晚，我们拉着手风琴唱歌，我们的劳累也就随着歌声消逝了。
    荒地在我们的脚下，一片一片地被征服，花生也随着一片一片地成长起来，到了缅桂花飘香的八月，整个的豹子山已变成一座黄花盛开的花生山了。
