We Must Seriously Deal with Imperialism
Representative Fu Qiutao Talks About All People Being Soldiers

Chairman, fellow representatives:

I fully endorse the reports made by Premier Zhou, Vice Premier Li Fuchun, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen.

Recently, the former local government of Tibet and a small handful of reactionaries, under the instigation of British imperialism and Indian expansionist elements, organized an armed rebellion, attempting to split Tibet away, undermining national unity and state unification. This is absolutely not allowed and must be severely punished. I firmly support all measures taken by the State Council to quell the Tibetan rebellion and dissolve the former local government of Tibet, and I congratulate the People's Liberation Army and the people of Tibet on the significant victories achieved in quelling the rebellion. Only by thoroughly quelling the rebellion in Tibet and eliminating all remaining forces of imperialism and foreign reactionaries in Tibet can we consolidate the unification of the motherland and accelerate the socialist construction of new Tibet. We issue a stern warning to imperialists and Indian expansionist elements: attempts to exploit the Tibet issue to realize expansionist ambitions will never succeed, and any acts by imperialists and reactionaries to undermine our country's unification will be met with a shameful defeat. Under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and under the glorious illumination of the general line for socialist construction, the people of our country achieved an unprecedented Great Leap Forward on all fronts of the national economy in 1958. In particular, the widespread establishment of people's communes combining workers, farmers, merchants, students, and soldiers, and integrating government administration with commune management, in rural areas throughout the country, is of utmost importance for realizing our country's grand national economic plan for 1959 and accelerating our country's socialist construction.

To deal with imperialism, we must not only have a strong regular army but also a strong militia organization

In 1958, when the people of our country were engaged in great socialist construction with soaring revolutionary enthusiasm, U.S. imperialism carried out military provocations in the Taiwan Strait area, arousing the unparalleled anger of our people. In order to defend the socialist construction of the motherland, the people of the whole country, according to Chairman Mao's instructions, launched a mass movement of all people being soldiers while vigorously developing the people's commune movement, and in many areas, militia divisions and regiments were generally organized. Chairman Mao said: "The organization of militia divisions is very good and should be promoted. This is a military organization, a labor organization, an education organization, and a sports organization. The imperialists are bullying us so much that we need to deal with them seriously. We must not only have a strong regular army, but we must also run militia divisions on a large scale. In this way, when imperialism invades our country, it will make it impossible for them to move an inch." This instruction from Chairman Mao received warm support from the people of the whole country. From rural areas to cities, from factories to schools, from enterprises to government offices, militia organizations were established and developed. The broad masses of workers, peasants, students, staff members, and cadres regarded participation in the militia as a great honor and were willing to contribute their strength to defend the motherland. This fully demonstrates that Chairman Mao's thought on people's war has penetrated deeply into the hearts of the people, becoming the actual action of the broad masses and demonstrating unparalleled power.

The militia is not only a strong reserve force for the People's Liberation Army but also a powerful production force

The rapid development of the mass movement of all people being soldiers is not accidental. This is due to the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao; it is due to the recognition by the people of our country, in the long revolutionary war, that only by arming themselves can they defeat armed counter-revolution and become the masters of this land of China; it is because the militia system is a system welcomed by the people of our country. After the militia was universally organized, under the leadership of the Party and with the help of local garrisons, political work was strengthened, military training was carried out in conjunction with production, and the principles of organizational militarization, combat-oriented action, collective life, and democratic management were implemented. As a result, their organizational discipline became stronger, their actions became faster, their lives became more orderly, and their labor efficiency was greatly improved, greatly promoting the development of industrial and agricultural production. The militia has not only become a strong reserve force for the People's Liberation Army but also a powerful production force on the industrial and agricultural production front. In the mass steelmaking, deep plowing, and water conservancy construction movements, the militia demonstrated its shock force role and produced good results. For example, at the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company, more than 100 backbone militiamen, under the battle cry of "Fighting for steel, every second counts," used their spare time last September to build a small blast furnace with a daily output of more than 60 tons in 15 days. By mid-April of this year, it had produced 12,028 tons of iron, promoting the production of iron and steel. Another example is the First Battalion of the Militia Regiment of the Department of Civil Engineering and Architecture of Tsinghua University, which went to Miyun County last October to help the masses with the autumn harvest. They learned from the example of the People's Liberation Army, helping the masses carry water and sweep the courtyards. Their production enthusiasm was very high and their discipline was very good. The masses said: "Today's college students have changed their appearance and are just like the People's Liberation Army." There are countless examples of militia shock production in rural areas. The militia has also played a significant role in eliminating animal pests, protecting production, annihilating airborne special agents, and maintaining public security. According to incomplete statistics from six provinces – Guangdong, Guangxi, Anhui, Yunnan, Sichuan, and Shanxi – last year, the militia eliminated a total of more than 492,000 harmful animals such as tigers, leopards, wolves, and bears. Last autumn, in the Qinbei area of Guangdong and the Shangsi area of Guangxi, airborne special agents were discovered. After learning about this, the local government immediately mobilized more than 1,600 militiamen, who, after a day and night search, captured all three airborne special agents alive, seized seven pistols, 1,356 rounds of ammunition, and a radio station. With the organization of all people being soldiers, no enemy airborne or infiltrating special agents can escape the palm of the people.

In coastal areas, the militia has established joint defense with local garrisons, and the army and the people are twisted into one rope. The army regards the militia as its own brothers and the people's commune as its own home, actively supporting mass production and caring for the lives of the masses. In places where there are concerns about the enemy, the army protects the masses in fishing, rescues them in storms, and helps them solve their difficulties. Through joint defense, the masses' concept of national defense has been raised, and at the same time, the militia's cooperation with the troops in guarding posts, organizing patrols, and strengthening coastal defense has strengthened the unity between the army and the people. The masses say: "The army loves the people, and the people love the army; the army and the people are closer than fish and water." Due to the implementation of joint army-civilian defense, the militia can better carry out military training and political education with the help of the army. With the support of the militia, the army has a strong combat assistant and reliable ears and eyes, and has also received great support in manpower and material resources. In particular, the militia on the front lines of Fujian, while engaging in production, supports the front lines and cooperates with the troops in shelling Jinmen. Under the battle cry of "Everything for the front lines," they undertook battle support tasks such as repairing roads, transporting materials, transporting ammunition, rescuing the wounded, and maintaining transportation. In battle, some militiamen volunteered to be artillerymen, directly participating in artillery battles, demonstrating the heroic spirit of the Chinese people.

Demobilized and retired soldiers are not only the backbone of the militia but also an active force in building socialism

Demobilized and retired soldiers are the backbone of the militia. There are now more than 7.3 million demobilized and retired soldiers in the country. Our Party and government have always attached importance to demobilization work and have provided meticulous care and attention to demobilized and retired soldiers, which has stimulated the sense of honor of demobilized and retired comrades and greatly promoted their enthusiasm for building socialism. These comrades have received training and education in the army, have a higher level of political awareness, have a habit of collective life, have stronger organizational discipline, can train and command the militia, have great enthusiasm, strong determination, and can overcome various difficulties; they have certain work experience and technical knowledge and can contribute to socialist construction. Now, in many areas, they have been elected as grassroots cadres, various model figures, and advanced workers. This is a group of good comrades, good backbones, and good forces educated by the army under the leadership of our Party and Chairman Mao. They are not only the backbone of implementing all people being soldiers but also an active force on all fronts of socialist construction.

In the future, every year a group of demobilized soldiers will join the militia, which is a group of good instructors in the militia. In the militia, in addition to strengthening political work in conjunction with socialist education, raising their ideological awareness, and striving to complete the production, work, and study tasks of their units, they can use the gaps in production to carry out necessary military training and launch mass amateur martial arts activities; as long as there is a possibility, they can also rely on demobilized and retired soldiers, using the method of teaching apprentices, combined with various national construction undertakings, to train various specialized soldiers, such as: combining fisheries and shipping, training naval reserve soldiers; combining civil aviation and national defense sports, training air force reserve soldiers; combining agricultural tractor stations, training tank reserve soldiers; combining construction engineering, training engineering reserve soldiers; combining health care, training health reserve soldiers; combining postal and telecommunications, training communications reserve soldiers, and so on. In this way, the militia training is organically combined with production and construction, and many militiamen are trained to become talented people who are both red and expert and have military knowledge.

After our country realizes all people being soldiers, our army will have a strong reserve force, and we will have a solid national defense. If imperialism dares to invade our motherland, our hundreds of millions of militiamen will listen to the call of the motherland, mobilize, and fight for the thorough, complete, and total annihilation of the enemy! The Party Central Committee's "Resolution on Several Issues Concerning People's Communes" states: "Those robbers who are wholeheartedly trying to rob us, be careful, don't try to touch us who are engaged in peaceful labor, we are prepared. If imperialism dares to launch a war of aggression against our country, then we will realize all people being soldiers, the militia will cooperate with the People's Liberation Army, and at any time supplement the People's Liberation Army, and completely defeat the invaders."

If there is anything inappropriate in the above speech, please correct me, fellow representatives.

专栏：

    必须认真对付帝国主义
    傅秋涛代表谈全民皆兵主席、各位代表：
    我完全拥护周总理、李富春副总理、李先念副总理、彭真副委员长所作的各项报告。
    最近原西藏地方政府和一小撮反动派，在英帝国主义和印度扩张主义分子指使下，组织武装叛乱，企图把西藏分裂出去，破坏民族团结和国家统一，这是绝不容许的，必须受到严厉的惩处。我坚决拥护国务院下令平息西藏叛乱集团和解散原西藏地方政府等一切措施，并祝贺西藏地区人民解放军和西藏人民在平息叛乱中，所取得的重大胜利。只有彻底地平息了西藏地区的叛乱，肃清帝国主义和外国反动派在西藏地区的一切残余势力，才能巩固祖国的统一，才能加速新西藏的社会主义建设。我们对帝国主义和印度扩张主义分子，提出严正地警告：企图利用西藏事件，实现扩张野心的阴谋永不能得逞，任何帝国主义和反动分子破坏我国统一的行为，都将遭到可耻的失败。我国人民在党中央和毛主席的领导下，在社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，一九五八年，在国民经济的各个战线上，取得了史无前例的大跃进，特别是，在全国农村普遍建立了工农商学兵相结合的、政社合一的人民公社。人民公社的不断巩固和发展，对于实现我国一九五九年宏伟的国民经济计划、加速我国社会主义建设，具有极为重大的意义。
    为了对付帝国主义，我们不但有强大的正规军还要有强大的民兵组织
    一九五八年当我国人民正以冲天的革命干劲，从事伟大的社会主义建设的时候，美帝国主义在台湾海峡地区，进行军事挑衅，激起了我国人民无比的愤怒。为了保卫祖国的社会主义建设，全国人民根据毛主席的指示，在人民公社化运动蓬勃发展的同时，掀起了一个全民皆兵运动，在许多地区，普遍组织了民兵师、团。毛主席说：“民兵师的组织很好，应当推广。这是军事组织，又是劳动组织，又是教育组织，又是体育组织。帝国主义者如此欺负我们，这是需要认真对付的。我们不但要有强大的正规军，我们还要大办民兵师。这样，在帝国主义侵略我国的时候，就会使他们寸步难行。”主席这个指示，获得了全国人民热烈的拥护。从农村到城市，从工厂到学校，从企业到机关，都建立和发展了民兵组织。广大工人、农民、学生、职员和干部，都把参加民兵视为极大的光荣，愿为保卫祖国贡献自己的力量。这充分地说明了毛主席的人民战争思想，已经深入人心，成为广大群众的实际行动，显示了无比的威力。
    民兵既是解放军的强大的后备力量，又是强有力的产业军
    全民皆兵运动所以能够迅速地发展，并不是偶然的。这是由于党中央和毛主席的正确领导；是由于我国人民在长期的革命战争中，认识到只有把自己武装起来，才能战胜武装的反革命，才能成为中国这块天地的主人；是由于民兵制度是我国人民喜闻乐见的一种制度。民兵普遍组织起来之后，在党的领导下，在各地驻军的帮助下，加强了政治工作，结合生产进行了军事训练，实行了组织军事化、行动战斗化、生活集体化、管理民主化，因而他们的组织纪律性更强，行动更加迅速，生活更加有秩序，劳动效率也就更加提高，大大地促进了工农业生产的发展。民兵，不但成为人民解放军强大的后备力量，而且成为工农业生产战线上的一支强有力的产业军。在大炼钢铁、深翻土地、兴修水利等生产运动中，民兵都显示了他的突击作用，产生了良好的影响。例如：石景山钢铁公司，一百余名基干民兵，去年九月间，在“为钢铁而战、分秒必争”的战斗口号下，利用业余时间，在十五天内兴建了一座日产六十多吨的土洋高炉，到今年四月中旬，已产铁一万二千零二十八吨，促进了钢铁的生产。又如：清华大学土木建筑系民兵团第一营，去年十月到密云县，帮助群众秋收，他们学习解放军的榜样，帮助群众挑水、扫院子，生产情绪很高，纪律很好。群众说：“如今的大学生变了样，简直像解放军一样。”在农村中民兵突击生产的模范事例，是不胜枚举的。民兵在除兽害、保卫生产、歼灭空降特务、维护治安方面，也发挥了很大的作用。据去年广东、广西、安徽、云南、四川、山西六个省不完全的统计，民兵共消灭虎、豹、狼、熊等各种害兽四十九万二千余只。去年秋季，在广东的钦北和广西的上思这个地区，发现空降特务，当地政府获悉后，立即动员一千六百余名民兵，经一昼夜搜索，将空降特务三人全部活捉，缴获短枪七支，各种子弹一千三百五十六发，电台一部。我们有了全民皆兵的组织，敌人任何的空降和潜入特务，都逃不出人民的手掌。
    在沿海地区，民兵与当地驻军建立了军民联防，军民拧成了一条绳。军队把民兵看成是自己的亲兄弟，把人民公社当作自己的家，积极支援群众生产，关心群众生活。在有敌情顾虑的地方，军队保护群众捕鱼，有风暴，就抢险；有困难，就帮助解决。通过联防，提高了群众的国防观念，同时由于民兵配合部队站岗放哨、组织巡逻，也就加强了海边防，密切了军民的团结。群众说：“军爱民、民爱军、军民赛过鱼水亲。”由于实行了军民联防，民兵在军队的帮助下，可以更好地进行军事训练和政治教育，军队在民兵的支持下，军队也就有了强有力的作战助手和可靠的耳目，而且在人力、物力上也得到了很大的支援。特别是福建前线的民兵，一边生产，一边支前，配合部队炮击金门。他们在“一切为了前线”的战斗口号下，担负了抢修公路、搬运物资、运送弹药、救护伤员和维护交通等战勤任务，在战斗中，有的民兵自动充当炮手，直接参加炮战，表现了中国人民的英雄气概。
    复员、退伍军人既是民兵的骨干，又是建设社会主义的积极力量
    复员、退伍军人是民兵的骨干。现在全国有复员、退伍军人七百三十余万人。我们党和政府对于复员工作一向是重视的，对于复员、退伍军人的关怀和照顾，是无微不至的，这就激发了复员、退伍同志的荣誉感，大大发挥了他们建设社会主义的积极性。这些同志，他们受过部队的培养教育，政治觉悟较高，有集体生活的习惯，组织纪律性较强，能训练和指挥民兵，干劲大，决心强，能克服各种困难；他们有一定的工作经验和技术知识，能够为社会主义建设作出贡献。现在在很多地区，他们被选为基层干部、各种模范人物和先进工作者。这是我们党和毛主席领导下的军队教育出来的一批好同志、好骨干、好力量。他们不但是实行全民皆兵的骨干，而且是社会主义建设各个战线上的积极力量。
    今后每年都有一批退伍军人加入民兵，这是民兵中的一批好教员。在民兵中，除了结合社会主义教育加强政治工作，提高他们的思想觉悟，努力完成本单位的生产、工作和学习任务之外，可以利用生产空隙，进行必要的军事训练，开展群众性的业余练武活动；只要一有可能，还可以依靠复员、退伍军人，用带徒弟的办法，结合国家各项建设事业，培养各种专业兵，如：结合渔业航运事业，培养海军后备兵；结合民航和国防体育事业，培养空军后备兵；结合农业拖拉机站，培养坦克后备兵；结合建筑工程事业，培养工程后备兵；结合卫生医疗事业，培养卫生后备兵；结合邮电事业，培养通信后备兵，等等。这样，把民兵训练与生产建设有机地结合起来，把许多民兵培养成为又红又专、又有军事知识的人材。
    我国实现了全民皆兵后，我们的军队就有了强大的后备力量，我们就有了巩固的国防，如果帝国主义敢于侵略我们祖国，我们亿万民兵就会听从祖国的召唤，动员起来，为干脆、彻底、全部歼灭敌人而战！党中央“关于人民公社若干问题的决议”中说：“一心想要抢劫我们的强盗们，你们小心一点儿吧，不要妄想来碰我们这些从事和平劳动的人们，我们是准备好了的。帝国主义如果竟敢发动对我国的侵略战争，那时我们就将实现全民皆兵，民兵就将配合人民解放军，并且随时补充人民解放军，彻底打败侵略者。”
    以上发言如有不妥之处，请各位代表予以指正。
