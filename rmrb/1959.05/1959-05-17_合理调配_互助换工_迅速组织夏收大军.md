Rationally Allocate, Help Each Other with Labor Exchange, and Quickly Organize the Summer Harvest Army
Weinan Tongguan Commune's Management Districts and Production Teams Sign Mutual Support Contracts According to the Principle of Equivalent Exchange
Xiangyang Shiqiao Commune's Qixin Production Team Prioritizes Arrangements to Solve the Summer Harvest and Planting Labor Shortage

(Our newspaper, Xi'an, 16th) The Tongguan Commune in Weinan County, Shaanxi Province, in arranging summer harvest labor, implements the principle of graded management under unified leadership. It first arranges labor based on the production team, giving full play to the production team's enthusiasm. Under the unified leadership of the commune, it organizes labor allocation, adjustment, and mutual support between management districts and between production teams according to the principle of equivalent exchange, basically ensuring the needs of the summer harvest in the case of labor shortages.

The Tongguan Commune has planted more than 97,000 mu of wheat and more than 26,000 mu of summer coarse grains this year, which will begin to be harvested in late May. This year is the first summer harvest after communization. The scale of production is even larger than last year, and the wheat is taller and denser than in previous years. The harvest volume has increased, requiring more labor than in previous years for harvesting. In the past, each person could harvest an average of 1.5 mu per day (including transportation), but this year each person can only harvest an average of about 1 mu per day. At the same time, this year's summer harvest still mainly relies on manual harvesting, and the time is very tight. After the start of harvesting, it must be completed within five days, otherwise, grain will be lost, causing damage. According to calculations, the commune has 26,611 laborers. Except for those participating in railway and highway construction, infrastructure, and rural cooks, childcare workers, and feeders, as well as pregnant women and patients, only 17,314 people can directly participate in the summer harvest. If all the harvesting is to be completed within five days, there is still a shortage of 8,686 people.

Based on the above characteristics and situation, in order to solve this difficulty, the commune made unified research and arrangements. Because the commune covers a large area, there are river滩地, original fields, and mountainous areas. Due to different terrains, wheat varieties, and stubble, the maturity period of wheat also varies. For example, the river 滩地 matures earlier, the original fields mature later, and the mountainous areas mature even later; dry land matures earlier, and paddy fields mature later; Bi Ma No. 1 matures earlier, and Nan Da No. 2 matures later; main crop matures earlier, and replanted crop matures later, etc. The entire commune's wheat harvest, from start to finish, is spaced more than a month apart between early and late harvests. To this end, the commune first arranges labor based on the production team. According to the lightness, urgency, complexity, and simplicity of the summer harvest work, and the age, physical strength, and expertise of the commune members, various professional groups are organized to implement division of labor and contracting, adhere to the responsibility system, and fully tap the potential of the team's labor force. Then, according to the principle of equivalent exchange (payment of wages or mutual exchange of labor), and according to the early and late maturity of wheat in each team, the management district organizes labor adjustment and mutual support between production teams, and then the commune organizes labor adjustment and mutual support between management districts. Currently, mutual support contracts are being signed between management districts and between production teams. The twelve production teams under the Nantou Management District have now signed a contract, agreeing that at the end of May, Yuanshang will have more than 2,000 laborers and more than 1,000 livestock to support Yuanxia, and at the beginning of June, Yuanxia will have the same number of laborers and livestock to support Yuanshang. At the same time, the commune is organizing the Taiyao, Lijiacun, and Anle management districts, which are near the mountains and have later wheat maturity, to support the Daiziying, Nantou, and Wucun management districts. In mutual support, they all record each other's work, and the owed work will be paid in cash when settling accounts in the future.

In order to ensure that the farmers who come to cut wheat in mutual support eat well, live well, and work well, the eight management districts of the entire commune have established eight reception stations, preparing food and accommodation. In addition, the entire commune and each production team are also reducing rural service personnel, organizing all cadres, students, and urban residents to participate in the summer harvest. In this way, due to the implementation of graded management under unified leadership and the utilization of the superiority of the commune, the summer harvest task of the entire commune can basically be guaranteed to be completed in a timely manner.

(Our newspaper, Wuhan, 16th) The Qixin Production Team of the Shiqiao People's Commune in Xiangyang County, Hubei Province, has rationally arranged its labor force, solving the difficulty of insufficient labor in the summer harvest and planting. This production team has 5,359 mu of summer harvest crops, which are growing better than last year. According to calculations, the harvesting, threshing, transporting, and drying alone require more than 8,100 workdays. Adding the weeding, topdressing, thinning, pest control of cotton, millet, sorghum, corn, and sweet potatoes, as well as summer planting and repairing the wheat fields, etc., a total of more than 34,700 workdays are required. However, this production team has only 594 laborers who can participate in the summer harvest and planting. Even if the attendance rate reaches 100%, there is still a shortage of more than 3,200 workdays during the busy summer harvest and planting season.

Regarding the solution to this problem, after discussion by the masses, the production team decided to first classify the farm work according to its urgency and priority. The weeding, topdressing, thinning, pest control of spring-sown crops, and the sorting of wheat fields and warehouses should be done before the wheat harvest. According to calculations, if all these farm works are done before wheat harvesting, only about 18,000 workdays will be needed during harvest. The existing labor force can completely guarantee the completion of the wheat harvesting task on time. At the same time, the team also paid special attention to tool reform to improve work efficiency. This aspect can save about 9,000 workdays. For example, promoting 50 "shan" sickles, which are two to three times more efficient than ordinary sickles, can save 700 workdays; installing side boards on the existing 50 rubber-wheeled carts to transport fertilizer to the fields and wheat back, which can save more than 580 workdays; appropriately increasing the number of wheat fields by reducing transportation distances, which can save about 500 workdays; changing curved roads to straight roads to reduce transportation time, which can also save dozens of workdays. In this way, the production team can complete the summer harvest and planting within 20 days after the start of harvesting.

Strengthening collaboration in the summer harvest and planting is also one of the important measures for this team to solve the shortage of labor. The crop area is unbalanced in the team, the varieties are unbalanced, and the crops grow better or worse is unbalanced, so it is very necessary to adjust the labor force for collaboration in a planned way. For example, the Fourth Team only has 32 laborers, and the summer harvest area reaches 349 mu, with each laborer bearing an average of 10.9 mu; the Seventh Team has 37 laborers, and the summer harvest area is 268 mu, with each laborer bearing only 6.9 mu. The way to resolve this issue is by collaboration between teams and the signing of labor exchange contracts. For example, the Seventh Team promised to support the Eighth Team, which has heavy wheat harvesting tasks, with 300 workdays; the Eighth Team helps the Seventh Team weed 60 mu of single-crop cotton fields before harvesting. After this collaboration, the contradictions of labor shortages on both sides are resolved, and the commune members are very satisfied. (Attached picture)

    合理调配　互助换工　迅速组织夏收大军
    渭南潼关公社各管理区各生产队按照等价交换原则签订互相支援合同
    襄阳石桥公社齐心生产队按照轻重缓急排队解决夏收夏种劳力不足困难
    本报西安16日电　陕西省渭南县潼关公社在安排夏收劳力中，贯彻统一领导下的分级管理原则，先以生产队为基础进行安排，充分发挥生产队的积极性，又在公社的统一领导下，按照等价交换的原则组织管理区与管理区之间，生产队与生产队之间的劳力调拨调剂、互相支援，在劳动力缺乏的情况下，基本上可保证夏收的需要。
    潼关公社今年共种小麦九万七千多亩，夏杂粮二万六千多亩，5月下旬就要开始收割。今年是公社化以后的第一个夏收，生产规模比去年更加扩大，小麦长得比往年又高又密，收获量加大，需要有比往年更多的劳力进行收割。往年每人每天平均能收割（包括运输在内）一亩半，今年每人每天平均只能收割一亩左右。同时，今年夏收仍然主要是依靠人力收割，并且时间很紧，开镰后，在短短的五天内，就要割完，不然会落粒，造成损失。根据计算，全社劳力二万六千六百一十一人，除参加修铁路、修公路、基建和农村炊事员、保育员、饲养员等服务人员以及孕妇、病人外，实际上能直接参加夏收的只有一万七千三百一十四人，如果要在五天内全部收割完毕，尚差八千六百八十六人。
    根据上述特点和情况，为了解决这个困难，这个公社作了统一的研究和安排。因为公社范围很大，有河滩地，也有原地，还有山地。由于地势、小麦品种和茬口不同，小麦成熟期也有先后，如河滩地熟的早，原地熟的迟，山地熟的更迟；旱地熟的早，水地熟的迟；碧码一号熟的早，南大二号熟的迟；正茬熟的早，回茬熟的迟等等。全社小麦从开始收割到结束，早收割和晚收割相距有一个多月的时间。为此，公社先以生产队为基础安排劳力，根据夏收活路的轻重、缓急和繁简，社员的年龄、体力、专长等，组织各种专业组，实行分工包干，坚持责任制度，充分挖掘本队劳力的潜力。然后又根据等价交换（现付工资或互相换工）的原则，按照各队小麦成熟的迟早，由管理区组织生产队与生产队之间，再由公社组织管理区与管理区之间的劳力调剂，互相支援。目前各管理区与管理区之间，生产队与生产队之间，正在签订互相支援合同。南头管理区所属的十二个生产队，现已签订了合同，约定5月底原上将有二千多个劳力、一千多头牲口支援原下，到6月初原下再有同等数量的劳力和畜力支援原上。同时公社又组织靠山而小麦成熟较晚的太要、李家村、安乐等管理区，支援代字营、南头、吴村等管理区。互相支援中，他们都互相记工，将来结算时欠的工都付现金。
    为使互相支援的劳力前来割麦的农民吃好、住好、劳动好，全公社八个管理区成立了八个招待站，准备食粮和住宿。此外，全公社和各生产队还从压缩农村服务人员，组织所有干部、学生、城镇居民参加夏收。这样，由于贯彻了统一领导下的分级管理，发挥了公社的优越性，基本上就可保证全公社的夏收任务适时完成。
    本报武汉16日电　湖北省襄阳县石桥人民公社齐心生产队合理安排劳动力，解决了夏收、夏种中劳力不足的困难。这个生产队夏收作物五千三百五十九亩，生长得比去年好。据计算，仅收、打、运、晒这几项，就需要八千一百多个工，加上棉花、粟谷、高粱、包谷、红薯的锄草、追肥、间苗、治虫以及夏种和修理麦场等活路，共需要三万四千七百多个劳动日。但这个生产队能参加夏收、夏种的劳力只有五百九十四个，即使出勤率达百分之百，在夏收夏种抢火色这一段时间内，也还差三千二百多个劳动日。
    对解决这个问题的办法，这个生产队经过群众的讨论，决定先把农活按缓急分类排队，将春播作物的锄草、追肥、间苗、治虫和整理麦场、仓库等活路，抢在麦收前搞好。据计算，如果把这些农活都在割麦前做好，到收割时，只需一万八千个左右劳动日就够了。现有的劳动力完全可以保证按时完成割麦任务。同时这个队还特别注意了工具改革，提高工效。这方面可节省出九千左右个劳动日。例如推广工效较普通镰刀高二倍到三倍的删镰五十部，可以省工七百个；把现有的五十部胶轮车安上帮板，每天下田时运肥，回来时运麦，可省五百八十多个工；适当增建地头麦场，减少往返运力，可省工五百个左右；改弯路为直路，减少运输时间，也可省工几十个。这样，这个生产队在开镰后二十天内就可以完成夏收夏种。
    加强在夏收夏种中的协作，也是这个队解决劳动力不足的重要措施之一。这个队的作物面积不平衡，品种不平衡，作物生长好坏也不平衡，因此，有计划地调整劳动力进行协作十分必要。如第四小队只有三十二个劳动力，夏收面积达三百四十九亩，每个劳动力平均担负十点九亩；第七小队三十七个劳动力，夏收面积二百六十八亩，每个劳动力只担负六点九亩。齐心生产队解决这个问题的办法是由小队与小队之间互相协作，签订换工合同。如第七小队答应支援麦收任务繁重的第八小队三百个工；第八小队则在收割前帮助七小队锄一熟棉田六十亩。这样协作以后，两方面的劳力不足的矛盾都解决了，社员都很满意。（附图片）
