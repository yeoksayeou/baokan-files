Xinhua News Agency, May 22nd. The Ambassador of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to China, Li Yong-ho, at a press conference held here today, sternly condemned the Syngman Rhee clique for openly establishing a so-called "Overseas Emigration Committee" under the manipulation of the United States, in order to step up the heinous act of selling South Koreans to foreign capitalists and farm owners.

In response to questions raised by reporters, Ambassador Li Yong-ho pointed out that from 1954 to 1958, the Syngman Rhee clique had already forcibly sold 2,265 South Koreans to foreign countries under the guise of so-called "special emigration." The Syngman Rhee clique's recent announcement of the so-called "Overseas Emigration Committee Order" is to promote on a larger scale the heinous plan of selling South Koreans to foreigners as slaves. Ambassador Li Yong-ho said that the Syngman Rhee clique is plotting to sell the first batch of as many as 10,000 South Koreans to foreign countries according to this order.

In his speech, Ambassador Li Yong-ho emphasized that the Syngman Rhee clique's plan to sell South Koreans to foreign countries was formulated under the instigation of US imperialism. He strongly condemned the US imperialists for forcibly occupying South Korea, carrying out military intervention in South Vietnam, and the aggressive act of seizing China's territory of Taiwan. He said that the US imperialists are doing the dirty work of executioners. However, they will inevitably be sanctioned by the peace-loving people of the world.

    朝鲜驻华大使在京记者招待会上指出
    李承晚集团勾结美国贩卖人口
    新华社22日讯　朝鲜民主主义人民共和国驻中国大使李永镐今天在这里举行的记者招待会上，严正谴责了李承晚集团在美国操纵下公然成立所谓“海外移民委员会”，以加紧推行把南朝鲜人卖给外国资本家和农场主的罪恶行为。
    李永镐大使在答复记者提出的问题时指出，李承晚集团在1954年到1958年期间，就曾经在所谓“特别移民”的名义下强把二千二百六十五名南朝鲜人卖给外国。李承晚集团最近公布所谓“海外移民委员会命令”，是为了更大规模地推行把南朝鲜人出卖给外国人当奴隶的罪恶计划。李永镐大使说，李承晚集团阴谋根据这项命令卖给外国的第一批南朝鲜人达一万人之多。
    李永镐大使在讲话中着重指出，李承晚集团把南朝鲜人出卖给　外国的计划，是在美帝国主义的策动下制定的。他强烈谴责美帝国主义者强占南朝鲜，对南越进行军事干涉和霸占中国的领土台湾的侵略行动。他说，美帝国主义者干的是刽子手的勾当。但是，他们必将受到世界爱好和平人民的制裁。
