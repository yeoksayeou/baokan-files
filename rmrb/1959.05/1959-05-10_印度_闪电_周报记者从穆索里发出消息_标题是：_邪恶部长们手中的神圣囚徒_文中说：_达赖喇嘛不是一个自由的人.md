Xinhua News Agency, 9th: New Delhi dispatch: The Indian "Lightning" weekly reporter Sethi reported from Mussoorie that the Dalai Lama "is not a free man." This weekly published this news on May 2nd under the title "Holy Prisoner in the Hands of Evil Ministers." The full text is as follows:

　　The Dalai Lama is not a free man. His every move is dictated by the three cabinet ministers and several senior officials who came here with him.

　　When I visited the Dalai Lama's residence here, I got a strong impression from conversations with his entourage that there was a minister responsible for the Dalai Lama making the decision to leave that "country." If he were to decide for himself, the Dalai Lama would like to reach an agreement with the Chinese authorities.

　　This special minister, who also controls the guards and other security arrangements at the Dalai Lama's palace, is not trusted by the Chinese, and he fears that he will lose his position if an agreement is reached.

　　It is this minister who should be held responsible for deliberately creating a situation in which the Dalai Lama got the strong impression that the Chinese would destroy the religious buildings in Lhasa and that his life was in danger.

　　He made the Dalai Lama believe that the Chinese were planning to arrest him and his family. A stray bullet that fell into the pond next to the palace helped this cunning minister.

　　The plan for the Dalai Lama's escape was prepared many days in advance. However, people did not let him know about this plan until the Dalai Lama agreed to leave Lhasa on that fateful night.

　　印度“闪电”周报记者从穆索里发出消息
    标题是：“邪恶部长们手中的神圣囚徒”
    文中说：“达赖喇嘛不是一个自由的人”
    新华社9日讯　新德里消息：印度“闪电”周报记者塞蒂从穆索里报道说，达赖喇嘛“不是自由的人”。这家周报5月2日在“邪恶的部长们手中的神圣囚徒”的标题下刊登了这条消息，全文如下：
    达赖喇嘛不是一个自由的人。他的一举一动都是受同他一起到这里的三位内阁部长和几位高级官员的指使的。
    当我访问这里达赖喇嘛的官邸的时候，我从同他的随从人员的谈话中得到这样一个强烈的印象：有那么一个部长要对达赖喇嘛作出离开那个“国家”的决定负责。如果让他自己决定的话，达赖喇嘛希望同中国当局达成协议。
    这位还控制达赖喇嘛宫里的卫队和其它安全安排的特殊部长得不到中国人的信任，他担心如果达成协议，他就会失去职位。
    就是这位部长应该负责的是，他故意造成一种局面，使达赖喇嘛得到这样一种强烈的印象：中国人就将摧毁拉萨的宗教建筑物，并且他的生命也有危险。
    他使得达赖喇嘛相信，中国人正打算把他和他的家属抓起来。落在宫旁池塘里的一颗流弹帮助了这个诡计多端的部长。
    达赖喇嘛逃跑的计划是在许多天以前就预先拟好的。但是，在达赖喇嘛同意在那个决定性的晚上离开拉萨以前，人们没有让他知道这个计划。
