    Correctly Understanding the Technical Revolution Movement

    The history of human society is a history of laborers constantly developing production technology and constantly increasing labor productivity. After a long period, mankind learned to use stones as tools, and later moved from the Stone Age to the Bronze Age, to the Iron Age, to the Machine Age, to the Electrical Age, and now to the dawning Atomic Age. This history is the history of the technical revolution. Has the Atomic Age reached the pinnacle of production technology? Of course not. The technical revolution will never have a pinnacle. The history of human material production will develop generation after generation, and the technical revolution will also develop generation after generation. Now, socialist production relations have opened up infinitely broad paths for the technical revolution. The technical revolution has vast horizons and unlimited prospects. It is clear that the technical revolution cannot be concluded on any particular morning. Leading cadres of the technical revolution must have great ambitions, boost their energy, and have foresight. With this long-term perspective, they can establish the determination to lead the technical revolution movement, have tenacious and persistent fighting spirit, continuously make revolution, and never be tired of fighting.

    Some people say that the technical revolution is a purely technical issue. This is a misunderstanding. The technical revolution is indeed a technical issue, but it is first and foremost an ideological and political issue, a people's issue. The technical revolution movement must be guided as an ideological movement from beginning to end. Some leading cadres of enterprises spend all day and night dealing with thousands upon thousands of big-character posters, handling thousands upon thousands of specific technical problems raised by the masses. This is of course very important. But doing only this is far from completing the leadership task of the technical revolution movement. For a leader, the most important thing is to be good at seeing political issues in economic problems, seeing ideological issues in technical problems, and raising these issues to the level of the relationship between productive forces and production relations, and the relationship between the economic base and the superstructure, to examine and solve them.

    As mentioned above, the technical revolution is of course about solving technical problems. Therefore, all leading cadres of industrial enterprises should study technology, work with the masses of workers, and work with technical personnel. In the common activities of the "three-in-one combination," they should gradually transform themselves from not understanding technology to mastering it. It is both an ideological movement and a technical movement. Ideology and technology are combined. Ideology is the soul, and technology is the body. This is our dialectical view and correct attitude towards the technical revolution movement.

    Some enterprises completely neglect the technical education of workers. They do not understand that people are the most important factor in productive forces. Without people whose technical skills have been improved, it is impossible to master new technical equipment and new process operations. Therefore, we must attach great importance to cultivating technical talents, systematically conduct technical education, help the masses of workers summarize advanced technical experience, and elevate it to scientific theory, and arm them with advanced scientific theory.

    Here, we have the erroneous argument of the so-called "six no revolutions":

    First, "cannot make revolution without raw materials." They say that without raw materials, there is nothing to do even if we start a technical revolution. This is a strange logic. We believe that only by vigorously engaging in the technical revolution can we overcome the difficulties of raw materials. Aren't the soap factories in Haifeng, Lufeng, and Xingning like this? They made soap from white clay. Their experience shows that precisely because of the lack of raw materials, it is even more necessary to vigorously engage in the technical revolution.

    Second, "production tasks are tight, no time for revolution." Where is there a place where production tasks are not tight now? Places where production tasks are not tight will not demand a technical revolution. It is precisely because production tasks are tight that a technical revolution is urgently needed. Revolution is precisely created by tense situations.

    Third, "only the mechanical industry can make revolution, other industries have no fate to be revolutionized." It must be clearly recognized that every industry has technical problems that need to be solved. Wherever there is production, there is a contradiction between advanced and backward technology. Therefore, every industry and every enterprise has the task of technical revolution.

    Fourth, "women cannot make revolution, only men can make revolution." This is a truly absurd argument. Female workers account for more than half of the Shantou Cannery, but the technical revolution is not doing badly.

    Fifth, "new workers cannot make revolution, only old technicians can make revolution"; "There are many new workers, they don't understand technology, they can't even hold a wrench, how can they make revolution?" This view is quite common. This is looking down on new workers. A large number of facts prove that when new workers are mobilized, they can not only engage in technical revolution, but also make major inventions and creations. The leader of the activated carbon group in Wujingfu, Jieyang, is only fifteen years old, and one of the group members is only thirteen years old. They are only middle school students, not veterans.

    Sixth, "workers do not understand technology and cannot make revolution." This is tantamount to saying bluntly that the technical revolution cannot be carried out as a mass movement, and inventions and creations can only be the business of scientists, engineers, and technical personnel. The Zijin Cement Plant failed to successfully test high-grade cement more than a hundred times. The reason is very simple: the factory director only relied on one or two technicians to experiment behind closed doors, and did not want workers to participate at all. Therefore, their experiments repeatedly failed.

    The exposure of all these erroneous ideas once again proves that the struggle between the advanced and the conservative, the struggle between relying on the majority and relying on the minority, and the struggle between the mass line and the anti-mass line are still universal and massive ideological struggles, and are persistent and tenacious ideological struggles, in the technical revolution movement. Only by continuously carrying out this ideological struggle can we continuously overcome the obstacles of right-leaning conservative thought and smoothly carry out the technical revolution movement.

### 正确地认识技术革命运动

    正确地认识技术革命运动
    人类社会的历史，是劳动者不断地发展生产技术，不断地提高劳动生产率的历史。人类经过了漫长岁月之后，学会了以石为器，后来又由石器时代进入铜器时代，进入铁器时代，进入机器时代，又进入电气时代以至现在已经开端的原子能时代。这一历史就是技术革命的历史。原子能时代是否就到了生产技术的顶点了呢？当然不是的，技术革命永远没有顶点，人类物质生产的历史将世世代代地发展下去，技术革命亦将世世代代地发展下去。现在，社会主义的生产关系又为技术革命开辟了无限广阔的道路，技术革命海阔天空，前程不可限量。由此可见，技术革命是不可以在某一个早上结束下来的。技术革命的领导干部，必须立大志，鼓大劲，高瞻远瞩。有了这种长期打算的态度，才能树立对技术革命运动的领导决心，才能有顽强持久的斗志，不断革命，永不厌战。
    有的人说：技术革命是一个纯技术的问题。这是一种误解。技术革命诚然是一个技术问题，但它首先是一个思想问题和政治问题，人的问题，必须从始到终地把技术革命运动当作一个思想运动来指导。有些企业的领导干部整日整夜地处理成千成万的大字报，处理群众提出的成千成万的具体技术问题，这当然是十分重要的。但是仅仅这样做了，还远不能完成对技术革命运动的领导任务。对于一个领导者来说，最重要的事情是善于从经济问题中看到政治问题，从技术问题中看到思想问题，把这些问题提到生产力与生产关系之间的关系和经济基础与上层建筑之间的关系上来加以考察，加以解决。
    上面已经提到，技术革命当然是要解决技术问题的，因此，一切工业企业的领导干部都应当钻研技术，和工人群众一道，和技术人员一道，在三结合的共同活动中，使自己逐步地由不懂技术到精通技术。又是思想运动，又是技术运动，思想与技术相结合，思想是灵魂，技术是肢体，这就是我们对待技术革命运动的辩证观点和正确态度。
    有的企业对于工人的技术教育完全忽略了。他们不懂得人是生产力中最重要的因素，没有技术提高了的人，就不可能掌握新的技术装备和新的工艺操作。因此，必须十分重视培养技术人材，有系统地进行技术教育，帮助工人群众总结先进的技术经验，并且使它上升为科学理论，用先进的科学理论武装他们。
    我们这里，有所谓“六不革命”的错误论调：
    一曰“缺乏原材料不能革命”。他们说，缺乏原材料，搞起技术革命也没有事情干。这是一种奇怪的逻辑。我们认为只有大搞技术革命才能克服原材料的困难。海丰、陆丰、兴宁的肥皂厂不正是这样的吗？他们用白土做成了肥皂，他们的经验说明，正因为缺乏原材料才更加需要大搞技术革命。
    二曰“生产任务紧张，没有工夫革命”。现在哪个地方生产任务不紧张呢？生产任务不紧张的地方那就不会要求技术革命，正因为生产任务紧张才迫切需要技术革命。革命正是紧张形势所造成的。
    三曰“只有机械行业才能革命，其他行业无命可革”。必须明确认识到：每一个行业都有需要解决的技术问题，凡是有生产的地方就有技术先进与技术落后的矛盾，因此每个行业、每个企业都有技术革命的任务。
    四曰“妇女不能革命，男人才能革命”。真是荒谬的论点。汕头罐头厂女工占半数以上，但是技术革命搞得并不坏。
    五曰“新工人不能革命，老技工才能革命”；“新工人多，不懂技术，连螺丝扳都不会拿，怎么革命呢？”这种观念相当普遍。这是看不起新工人。大量的事实证明，新工人发动起来，不但可搞技术革命，而且可搞出重大的创造发明。揭阳五经富活性炭小组的组长只有十五岁，其中有一个组员只有十三岁。他们只是中学生而已，并非老资格。
    六曰“工人不懂技术，不能革命”。这就等于干脆地说：技术革命不能大搞群众运动，创造发明只能是科学家、工程技术人员的事。紫金水泥厂试验高标号水泥一百多次不能成功，原因很简单，原来是厂长只是依靠一、二个技术人员关起门来试验，根本不要工人参加，因此他们的试验就连续地失败了。
    所有这些错误思想的暴露，又一次证明了先进和保守的斗争，依靠多数和依靠少数的斗争，群众路线与反群众路线的斗争，在技术革命运动中，仍然是普遍的大量的思想斗争，是持久的顽强的思想斗争，只有把这种思想斗争不断地进行下去，才能不断地克服右倾保守思想的障碍，使技术革命运动顺利开展。
