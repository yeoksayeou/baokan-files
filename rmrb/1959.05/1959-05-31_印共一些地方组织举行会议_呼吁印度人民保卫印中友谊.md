    Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, May 29th. Some local organizations of the Indian Communist Party recently held meetings, emphasizing the importance of maintaining Sino-Indian friendship.

    The Executive Committee of the Punjab State Organization of the Indian Communist Party recently held a three-day meeting in Jullundur. The meeting called on the Indian people to defend Sino-Indian friendship, and pointed out that this friendship is the foundation of Asian-African solidarity and a guarantee for defending India's freedom and sovereignty from imperialist aggression.

    The meeting pointed out that imperialists and other extremely reactionary elements have launched a loud propaganda campaign on the Tibet issue in order to divert people's attention from the military agreement signed between the United States and Pakistan. The meeting condemned certain people for using the Tibetan rebellion to carry out activities to undermine Sino-Indian friendship.

    The Orissa State Organization of the Indian Communist Party also passed some resolutions at a recent meeting, including resolutions on the US-Pakistan military agreement, and on Sino-Indian friendship and the Tibet issue. The latter called for further strengthening the friendly relations between India and China.

    As early as this year's "May Day," some Indian trade union leaders explained the truth about the Tibetan rebellion to thousands of workers and peasants at grand mass rallies held in Kolkata, Darjeeling near the Indian and Sikkim border, and Jamshedpur, the site of the Tata Steel Plant, and expressed their support for China's position.

    Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, May 30th. According to the Indian News Agency, the 8th annual meeting of the Darjeeling District Tea Plantation Workers' Union was held in Darjeeling town over the weekend. The annual meeting sent a message of tribute to the Chinese tea workers. The telegram stated that they guaranteed to strengthen the unity between the working classes and the people of the two countries on the basis of Panchsheel.

    In another resolution, the meeting called on tea workers to rise up against the imperialist conspiracy against Tibet and mobilize people to support the actions taken by China in that region.

    Workers in 65 of the 93 tea gardens in the region belong to the Darjeeling Tea Plantation Workers' Union.
