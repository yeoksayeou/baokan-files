Following the Increase Production and Practice Economy mobilization meeting convened by the Baoding Municipal Party Committee, the Baoding No. 2 Machine Tool Factory Party Committee immediately mobilized all employees to launch a vigorous airing of views, sparking a surging Increase Production and Practice Economy movement to investigate loopholes, explore potentials, expose problems, and oppose waste. They also prominently focused on rectifying enterprise management and establishing and improving basic and rational rules and regulations, carrying out rectification in a solid and practical manner, which yielded significant results.

Poor Quality, Significant Waste

In the early stages of the Increase Production and Practice Economy movement, most employees recognized the importance of the campaign; however, some employees held different views. Some said, "After last year's Great Leap Forward, production efficiency increased several times, and there's not much more to gain." "Many equipment modifications have already been made, what else is there to change?" Others said, "Anyway, it's all about hard work and clever work, why bother with a campaign?" In response to the above ideological problems, the leadership presented three major accounts to the employees. One was a quality account: In the first quarter, the average scrap rate for foundry workers was as high as 14.62%, worth 9,171 yuan. Machinists had 714 scrapped parts in April alone, resulting in a loss of 1,212 yuan. Over a hundred blank axles produced did not have the required hardness and were all scrapped. Due to unqualified components, the assembled diesel engines also had all sorts of problems. Of the 15 diesel engines tested in early April, none could leave the factory. By calculating the quality account, everyone realized that solving quality problems was not only the biggest form of economy, but also the key to increasing production.

The second account was a waste account: In the first quarter, the factory consumed a total of 2,802 yuan worth of oil and cotton waste; tool management was chaotic, and losses were serious. There was no component management system; workers took components at will. 300 pistons should have been produced, but 741 were produced, and when assembling, 124 were missing instead; 200 sets of shims were prepared, but only 100 sets were assembled, and then they were gone.

The third account was a potential account: If each workshop could raise its general level to the advanced level, the machine shop could increase more than 7,400 man-hours per month; some trainees cannot operate independently, and five lathes are idle; 20 of the 44 lathes are stopped for four hours each day, totaling 5,320 machine-hours, and so on. By calculating the accounts, all employees quickly launched a vigorous upsurge of airing views to investigate loopholes, explore potentials, expose problems, oppose waste, and find reasons, propose measures, and plug loopholes. Employees posted a total of 1,427 big-character posters around May Day.

Why did serious waste occur in man-hours, raw materials, and tools? Why were component and product quality low, and scrap rates high? While mobilizing employees to air their views and expose problems, the leadership held small-scale symposiums to find reasons and measures. Employees believed that one of the main reasons was chaotic management. Worker Qin Lanpeng said: "No one cares about scrap. Whoever produces scrap takes it to the welding shop. We can't keep up with the welding day and night, but when the foreman writes a note, there are fewer scraps. This shows that it is necessary to establish a scrap rework system." Worker Kang Jinming suggested: "There should be a material estimation and labor estimation system. Now we don't know where the economy and waste are, and we can't see who is good and who is bad."

Grasping the Key to Determine Principles

The leadership's calculations and the workers' analysis increasingly showed that to achieve the goal of increasing production and practicing economy, it is necessary to strengthen enterprise management and establish and improve rules and regulations. Subsequently, employees launched a debate around the issue of establishing rules and regulations. After the debate, the following three principles were clarified:

(1) Based on the principle of "combining worker participation in management with professional personnel," starting from the interests of production. According to this principle, it was decided that the statistics and publication of the production situation of each machine, each day, and each person should be borne by worker statisticians. The number of full-time statistical personnel was set at four, accounting for 0.9% of the total number of employees, which is much less than in the past, but the management work is more detailed than before.

(2) Focusing on current major key issues, distinguishing between primary and secondary. First, establish and improve the quality inspection responsibility system and various quotas, strengthen the management of warehouses, finance, semi-finished products, etc., around the operation plan.

(3) Strengthen financial management, and the authority to spend on innovation projects under 100 yuan remains with the team.

With the principles of strengthening management and improving the system clarified, the next step was the question of how to do it. Based on the experience of the rectification movement, the factory party committee, on the one hand, relied on management personnel, and on the other hand, educated management personnel to rely on the masses of workers, fully absorbed the opinions of the masses of workers, combined the experience and knowledge of management personnel with the practical experience of workers, so that the system was formulated practically and favorably for production. Before the system was drafted, the department staff took the initiative to consult with veteran workers on how to formulate it. The factory leadership convened a series of meetings such as employee conferences, group discussion meetings, and veteran worker symposiums. Through these meetings, the system was formulated more practically. Regarding tool management, the workers proposed dividing the tools into two categories: one is fixed, that is, daily used tools, which are managed by the group itself; the other is mobile, that is, infrequently used precision tool holders, which are set up by the factory's tool library for use with a sign. Worker Zhang Xiang and others classified the tools and listed them, and the workers of each group used their spare time to clean up the tools of the entire factory. At the same time, tool libraries and semi-finished product libraries were established, quality inspection personnel and statistical personnel were adjusted and enriched, ten team members were added, and original records were improved.

Establishing a System with Immediate Results

I. Planning and Management Aspects

The management of operation plans has been strengthened, and corresponding systems for planning, statistics, and quota management have been established to enrich the preparatory work before production. When each task is issued, "five haves" are achieved: (1) Have drawings; (2) Have quotas; (3) Have notification slips; (4) Have progress requirements; (5) Have quality standards. The specific arrangement of tasks implements the principle of "five fixations and three combinations," that is, under the joint combination of the foreman, planning personnel, and relevant veteran workers, according to the technical ability of each group and each person, the specific arrangement of each component to the group and workers is carried out by means of five fixations, namely, fixing people, fixing work, fixing equipment, fixing quality, and fixing time. The advantage of doing this is that the group's indicators are clear, the tasks are specific, and everyone in the factory knows what to do, which has played a positive role in ensuring the completion of production tasks on time and with quality.

II. Inspection System Aspects

The three-level inspection system of individuals, team leaders, and inspectors has been restored. Full-time inspection personnel master the three key links of the first piece, key parts, and work-in-process, and establish inspection stations to inspect all small processed parts piece by piece, strictly preventing non-standard parts from circulating in production.

In order to further improve the inspection work, the inspection personnel implemented "four clears," namely: (1) Clear the inspection of the day's products; (2) Distinguish between good and bad parts; (3) Explain the reasons for the scrap to the workers; (4) Clear the statistics of quality figures.

III. Financial Cost Management Aspects

In order to control revenue and expenditure balance and strictly control unnecessary production expenditures, a monthly revenue and expenditure budget system has been established from bottom to top in five aspects: supply and marketing (including raw materials, products, and low-value consumables), administrative expenses, financial expenditures, workshop expenses, and labor expenditures (including protective equipment, wages). At the end of the month, the departments and teams formulate separately, and after approval by the factory director, the financial department supervises the implementation.

In order to strengthen financial analysis and rationally use all raw materials, a warehouse management, limited material requisition, and workshop waste material cleaning and return system have been established in production. In addition to analyzing the results of budget expenditures for each department, workshop, and team on a monthly and quarterly basis, the financial analysis system also conducts a comprehensive analysis of man-hours and material quotas after each batch of products is completed, identifies waste and potential, and provides research and measures for the factory affairs meeting.

Through the strengthening of enterprise management and the establishment and improvement of necessary rules and regulations, the sense of responsibility of all employees for increasing production and practicing economy has been greatly enhanced, and production enthusiasm has been encouraged, thereby labor efficiency has continued to increase, and product quality has continued to improve. For example, after the implementation of planned quotas, the forging team of Pan Gengchen improved special tools such as reverberatory furnaces, increasing the crankshaft production from three to ten pieces. Worker Bai Shulin said: "With quotas issued for tasks, there is a goal to work towards." The workers also compiled a jingle: "Establishing a new system, the appearance has greatly changed, establishing a tool library, managed by the second level, requisition when used, return after use, the chaotic phenomenon is swept away."

Currently, the average processing man-hours per diesel engine in the factory has been reduced from 267 hours to 188 hours. The finished product rate of castings averaged 77.36% in April and averaged 87.2% from May 1 to 6. The scrap rate of castings decreased from an average of 5.54% in April to 0.213%. The machining scrap rate decreased from an average of 1.53% in April to an average of 0.22% in May. The eight diesel engines that were tested on May 6, 7, and 8 all started well and had sufficient horsepower. After the diesel engines were transported to the countryside, they were welcomed by the peasant brothers, and within a week, the commune received two letters of praise and a red flag.

    建立制度、提高质量、反对浪费
    ——保定第二机床厂开展增产节约的初步经验
    保定第二机床厂党委在保定市委召开了增产节约动员大会之后，立即发动全体职工展开大鸣大放，掀起了一个轰轰烈烈的查漏洞、查潜力、揭发问题、反对浪费的增产节约运动；并且突出地抓住了整顿企业管理，建立与健全基本的、合理的规章制度这一重要环节，扎扎实实地进行整改，收效很大。质量次、浪费大
    增产节约运动初期，大部分职工认识到这个运动的重要意义；但有的职工也存有不同认识。有人说：“经过去年的大跃进，生产效率提高了几倍，再搞油水不大。”“设备改的不少了，还改什么？”有人说：“反正苦干巧干就是了，何必非搞运动。”针对上述思想问题，领导方面向职工算了三笔大账。一笔是质量账：第一季铸工废品率平均高达14.62％，价值九千一百七十一元。机工仅4月份一个月就出现加工废品七百十四件，损失一千二百十二元。生产的一百多个勾备轴硬度不够，全部作废。由于部件不合格，装配出来的柴油机也毛病百出，4月上旬试车的十五台柴油机，一台也不能出厂。通过算质量账，大家认识到，解决质量问题不仅是最大的节约，而且也是增产的关键。
    第二笔是浪费账：第一季度全厂油料、棉丝共消耗二千八百零二元；工具管理混乱，遗失现象严重。没有部件管理制度，工人随便拿部件，活塞应作三百个，生产到七百四十一个，装配的时候，反而少了一百二十四个；隔垫圈下了二百台的料，可是装了一百台就没有了。
    第三笔是潜力账：如果各车间都能把一般水平提高到先进的水平的话，则机工一个月可增加七千四百多个工时；部分学员现在不能单独操作，五台车床闲着；四十四台车床中有二十台每天要停四小时，合五千三百二十台时，等等。通过算账，全厂职工迅速掀起了一个轰轰烈烈的查漏洞、查潜力、揭发问题、反对浪费和找原因、提措施、堵漏洞的鸣放高潮。职工们在五一节前后共贴出大字报一千四百二十七张。为什么造成工时、原材料、工具等方面的严重浪费？为什么部件和产品质量低、废品多？领导上在发动职工鸣放揭发问题的同时，召开了小型座谈会，找原因、找措施。职工们认为主要原因之一是管理混乱。工人秦兰鹏说：“出了废品没人管，谁出了废品谁就拿到电焊房去，我们昼夜焊也焊不过来，可是一叫工段长开条子，废品就少多了。由此看来，建立废品返修制度十分必要。”工人康金明提出：“应该有估料估工制度，现在节约浪费也不知道，谁好谁坏也看不出来。”
    抓住关键确定原则
    领导上的算账和工人们的分析，愈益表明：要达到增产节约目的，必须加强企业管理，建立与健全规章制度。接着，职工们围绕着建立规章制度问题展开辩论。经过辩论明确了以下三项原则：
    （1）本着“工人参加管理和专业人员相结合”的原则，从有利于生产出发。根据这个原则，确定每台每日每人生产情况的统计和公布都由工人统计员负担起来，专职的统计人员确定为四人，为职工总数的0.9％，比去年要少得多，而管理工作比过去细多了。
    （2）针对当前重大关键问题，分清主次。首先建立健全质量检验责任制和各项定额，围绕作业计划，加强仓库、财务、半成品等管理。
    （3）加强财务管理，对一百元以下的革新项目开支权限仍然放在小组。
    加强管理、健全制度的原则明确了，下一步就是如何做的问题。工厂党委根据整风的经验，一方面依靠管理人员，另一方面教育管理人员依靠工人群众，充分吸取工人群众的意见，使管理人员的经验知识和工人的切身体验结合起来，使制度订得切合实际，有利生产。在制度未起草以前，科室人员就主动找老工人商量怎么订，厂领导方面又召集了职工大会、小组讨论会、老工人座谈会等一系列的会议，经过这些会议，制度订得更加切合实际了。对于工具管理，工人提出把工具分为两大类：一类固定的，即日常用的工具，由小组自己管理；一类是流动的，即不经常用的精密工具卡具，由厂设立工具库，挂牌领用。工人张祥等把工具分类列出了单子，各小组工人利用业余时间把全厂工具进行了清理。同时，建立了工具库和半成品库，调整充实了质量检验人员和统计人员，增补了小组十大员，健全了原始记录。
        建立制度立竿见影
          一、计划管理方面
    加强了作业计划的管理工作，相应树立计划、统计、定额管理三项制度，充实生产前的准备工作。在每种任务下达时作到“五有”：（1）有图纸；（2）有定额；（3）有通知单；（4）有进度要求；（5）有质量标准。对任务的具体安排贯彻“五定三结合”的原则，即在工段长、计划人员和有关老工人的共同结合下，按照每个小组，每个人的技术能力，以定人、定活、定设备、定质量、定时间的五定办法，将每个部件具体安排给小组和工人。这样做的好处是：小组指标明确，任务具体，全厂上下人人心中有数，对保证按时按质完成生产任务起了积极的推动作用。
      二、检查制度方面
    恢复了个人、小组长、检查人员的三级检查制度。专职检查人员掌握首件、关键性制件和在制品的三大重点环节，并建立检查站，对所有小加工部件也进行逐件检查，严格防止不合规格的部件在生产中流转。
    为进一步把检查工作作好，检查人员实行了“四清”，即：（1）当日产品检查清；（2）好坏部件分清；（3）把废品原因向工人交代清；（4）把质量数字统计清。
    三、财务成本管理方面
    为了掌握收支平衡，严格管制生产不必要的开支，在供销（包括原料、产品和低值易耗）、行政费用、财务开支、车间费用、劳动开支（包括防护用品、工资）等五个方面，由下而上地建立了月度收支预算制度，月末由科室、工段分别制订，经厂长审批后，由财务部门监督执行。
    为加强财务分析，合理地使用一切原材物料，在生产中建立了仓库管理、限额领料和工段废料清理回退制度。财务分析制度，除按月按季对各部门、工段小组执行预算开支结果进行分析外，当每批产品完成后，对工时、原料定额还要作出全面分析，找出浪费和潜力，提供厂务会研究采取措施。
    通过企业管理工作的加强，必要规章制度的建立与健全，大大增强了全厂职工对增产节约的责任感，鼓舞了生产热情，从而劳动效率不断增长，产品质量不断提高。如锻工段潘更臣小组，自推行计划定额后，改进了反射炉等专用工具，使曲轴班产量由三根提高到十根。工人白树林说：“下达任务有了定额，干起来也有个奔头。工人们还编了这样一套顺口溜：“建立新制度，面貌大改观，成立工具库，二级来保管，用时领，用后还，混乱现象一扫完。”
    目前，全厂平均每台柴油机加工工时已由二百六十七小时降到一百八十八小时。铸件成品率4月份平均77.36％，5月1至6日平均达到87.2％。铸件废品率由4月份平均5.54％下降到0.213％。机工加工废品率由4月份平均1.53％，到5月平均下降到0.22％。5月6、7、8三天中重点试车的八台柴油机，达到了台台好发动，个个马力足。柴油机运到农村以后，受到农民兄弟的欢迎，一周的时间就接到了公社两封表扬信和一面红旗。（中共保定市委增产节约办公室）
