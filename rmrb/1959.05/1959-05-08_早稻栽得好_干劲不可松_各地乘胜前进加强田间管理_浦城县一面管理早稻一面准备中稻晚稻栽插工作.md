Xinhua News Agency, 7th. In the early rice fields of southern provinces and regions, which are a sea of green, many farmers who have just finished transplanting seedlings are carrying out intensive field management work. In Guangdong and Guangxi, where rice transplanting finished earlier, about 35% of the paddy fields have already been cultivated and topdressed once; Fujian, Jiangxi, Hunan and other provinces are rapidly carrying out field management work such as accumulating fertilizer, making fertilizer, topdressing, and cultivating early rice fields; in Sichuan, Hubei, and other provinces where transplanting started earlier, many communes, under the slogan of "plant well, manage well," immediately began field management work after transplanting.

Based on the characteristics of this year's early rice being transplanted early, densely, and regreening quickly, the people's communes in various rice-producing areas are paying special attention to topdressing with regreening fertilizer, cultivating and weeding, and preventing and controlling diseases and insect pests while strengthening field management. In Foshan Prefecture, Guangdong Province alone, 200,000 people have gone up the mountains and down to the sea to accumulate and make fertilizer, and currently have accumulated and made more than 100 million dan of various fertilizers. In Wanjing Sha Commune, Zhongshan County, which is located near the sea, more than 400 boats were sent out to sea to collect fertilizer, with each person averaging over 800 jin of fertilizer per day. More than 40,000 mu of young rice high-yield fields in Lingxi County, Guangxi, have been cultivated and topdressed twice, with an average of more than 200 dan of topdressing fertilizer applied per mu. In Leping County, Jiangxi Province, most of the early rice fields were fertilized with "anchoring fertilizer" immediately after transplanting, which increased the temperature at the base of the seedlings, allowing them to regreen quickly.

Currently, rice blast has been found in some rice fields in Guangxi and Fujian. The commune members are organizing forces to vigorously carry out disease and pest control work.

This newspaper reports that Pucheng County, Fujian Province, after completing early rice transplanting, in addition to leaving 30% of the labor force to manage the rice fields, concentrated the remaining labor force on the preparation work for mid-season and late-season rice transplanting. Pucheng County this year planted 50,000 mu more of single and double cropping early rice than originally planned, and completed it twenty days ahead of schedule. Precisely because of completing the task ahead of schedule and exceeding the target, some comrades became slack, thinking that this year's work in all aspects was solid, and that increased production was not a problem, so they could rest a little. After discovering these ideas, the Pucheng County Party Committee immediately convened an emergency meeting of the Party Committee Secretaries of each commune, continued to encourage efforts, explained the principles of advancing victoriously, and demanded that in addition to doing a good job in early rice field management, they should also seize the preparation work for mid-season and late-season rice transplanting. Subsequently, the Party Committees of each commune also separately convened cadre meetings of the brigade branch secretaries, captains, and small team leaders, resolved ideological problems, and specifically arranged the current production.

Currently, the county, commune, and brigade levels of Pucheng County have all established field headquarters to comprehensively strengthen leadership. Of the thirty-one county committee members, only three remained in the office to handle daily work, and the rest all went down to the communes and brigades to eat, live, and labor with the masses; the commune party committee secretaries and brigade branch secretaries also went deep into the fields to lead production in a timely manner. Now the county's agricultural labor force is basically divided into two fronts: one is early rice field management, and the other is mid-season and late-season rice transplanting preparation. In the recent ten days, the county has been vigorously accumulating fertilizer, and repairing and reinforcing more than 800 water conservancy projects; 130,000 mu of early rice has been cultivated, with about 500 jin of ash fertilizer applied per mu; 240,000 mu of mid-season and late-season rice fields have been plowed and harrowed once, with 20 jin of seeds prepared for sowing per mu. In order to ensure quality, inspection teams organized by cadres, technicians, and the masses carried out inspection of the preparation work for mid-season and late-season rice field transplanting plot by plot, and field by field; the mid-season and late-season rice transplanting work will soon enter a busy stage.

### 早稻栽得好　干劲不可松  各地乘胜前进加强田间管理  浦城县一面管理早稻一面准备中稻晚稻栽插工作

    早稻栽得好　干劲不可松
    各地乘胜前进加强田间管理
    浦城县一面管理早稻一面准备中稻晚稻栽插工作
    新华社7日讯　南方各省、区一片新绿的早稻田里，许多刚忙过插秧的农民们，正在进行紧张的田间管理工作。插秧结束较早的广东、广西两省、区，约有35％的稻田已经中耕追肥一遍；福建、江西、湖南等省正在迅速地展开早稻田间管理的积肥、造肥、追肥和中耕等工作；四川、湖北等省插秧较早的地区，许多公社在“插好一块、管好一块”的口号下，一插完秧就马上开始了田间管理工作。
    根据今年早秧插得早、插得密、返青早的特点，各稻区人民公社在加强田间管理时，都特别注意做好追施返青肥、中耕除草和防治病虫害等工作。广东省仅佛山专区就有二十万人上山下海积肥造肥，目前已积、造各种肥料一亿多担。滨海的中山县万顷沙公社派出了四百多只船出海涝肥，每人每日平均积肥八百多斤。广西岭溪县的四万多亩青年水稻丰产田，已经普遍耘田、追肥两遍，平均每亩施追肥两百多担。江西省乐平县大部分早稻田在插秧一结束后就施过了“安蔸肥”，增加了秧苗蔸部温度使秧苗返青很快。
    目前，广西、福建的部分稻田里发现了稻热病，当地人民公社的社员们正在组织力量，准备大力展开防治病虫害工作。
    本报讯　福建省浦城县在早稻插秧结束后，除留下30％劳力进行稻田管理外，其余劳力都集中到中稻、晚稻的插秧准备工作上。浦城县今年种植单、双季早稻比原计划多五万亩，而且提早二十天完成。正由于提前超额完成任务，有些同志松劲了，认为今年各方面工作踏实，增产没有问题，可以歇一歇了。中共浦城县委发现这些思想后，立即召开了各公社党委书记紧急会议，继续鼓干劲，说明乘胜前进的道理，要求除了做好早稻田间管理工作外，还要抓紧中稻和晚稻的栽插准备工作。接着各公社党委又分别召开了大队支部书记、队长和小队长的干部会议，解决了思想问题，并具体地安排了当前生产。
    目前浦城县的县、公社、大队都设立了田头指挥部，全面加强领导。全县三十一个县委委员，只有三人留在机关处理日常工作，其余全部下到公社和大队，和群众同吃、同住、同劳动；公社党委书记和大队支部书记，也深入田间，及时地领导生产。现在全县农业劳动力基本上分为两条战线：一是早稻田间管理，一是中稻、晚稻栽插准备。全县在最近十天里，大闹积肥，并修补加高加固水利工程八百多处；早稻中耕完成十三万亩，每亩施灰肥在五百斤左右；中稻和晚稻田有二十四万亩加犁加耙一次，每亩田准备下种二十斤。为了保证质量，由各级干部、技术员和群众组织的检查团，对中稻、晚稻田插秧准备工作进行了逐片、逐丘检查；中稻、晚稻栽插工作即将进入大忙阶段。（附图片）
