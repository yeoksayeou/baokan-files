Xinhua News Agency, Havana, May 15th: Prime Minister Castro delivered a televised speech here today, announcing that Cuba is about to launch land reform and calling on the people to unite and strive for its realization. In his speech, he once again condemned the aggressive policies pursued by the United States toward Cuba and other Latin American countries.

Castro said that the land reform agency will begin operations on the 17th of this month. Castro emphasized the necessity of land reform, stating that it is a fundamental measure of the Cuban revolution. Without land reform, unemployment cannot be eliminated, and Cuba will have neither a domestic market nor industry. Today, even children understand these conclusions, which is why they donate five cents of their allowance to buy tractors. Castro condemned the monopoly of land by foreign corporations and large landowners.

Castro called on all sectors of Cuban society to cooperate in the land reform. He said: "The struggle for land reform should be used to win the victory in the battle for industrialization. The struggle for land reform will not be a walk in the park, because we will be resisted by all the large estates and powerful companies. To win the struggle for land reform, we need everyone's cooperation." He also said that, while carrying out land reform, large-scale agricultural and pastoral production cooperatives will be organized. So far, two cooperatives have been organized.

Castro then condemned the anti-communist movement of the imperialists and domestic reactionaries. He said that the imperialists and reactionaries might even call Cespedes (the national leader of the Cuban people's war of independence in 1868) and Agramonte (a Cuban national hero of the nineteenth century) communists. Castro condemned the unequal trade relations between the United States and Cuba. He said that in the last two years, Cuba has lost ten billion dollars in trade with the United States.

In criticizing the United States' policy toward Latin American countries, Castro pointed out that the United States still adheres to its past view of Latin America, the consequences of which will be disastrous. He said that this policy is one that demonstrates its failure and should be replaced by a policy that means that the Latin American peoples develop on their own economic foundations rather than on the export market for surplus U.S. capital.

Castro also criticized the U.S.'s "military assistance." He pointed out that the weapons shipped by the United States are only intended to strengthen the small group of people who are accustomed to relying on force to seize the government.

    卡斯特罗谴责美国政策
    宣布古巴即将开始进行土地改革
    新华社哈瓦那15日电　卡斯特罗总理今天在这里发表了电视广播演说，宣布古巴即将展开土地改革工作，并且号召全国人民团结一致为实现土地改革而奋斗。他在演说中再次谴责美国对古巴和其他拉丁美洲国家所奉行的侵略政策。
    卡斯特罗说，土地改革机构将于本月17日开始活动。卡斯特罗强调指出了土地改革的必要性，他说，土地改革是古巴革命的基本措施，没有土地改革就消灭不了失业，古巴也不会有国内市场和工业。今天这些结论甚至连小孩子都知道，因此他们才捐出五分点心钱，去买拖拉机。卡斯特罗谴责了外国大公司和大庄园主对土地的垄断。
    卡斯特罗号召古巴各社会阶层在土地改革中进行合作。他说：应该以土地改革的斗争来赢得工业化战斗的胜利。土地改革的斗争不会像散步一样，因为我们将会遭到所有的大庄园和强大公司的反抗。为了使土地改革的斗争获胜，我们需要所有人的合作。他又说，在进行土地改革的同时，将组织大生产的农业和牧业生产合作社。到现在为止，已经组织了两个合作社。
    卡斯特罗接着谴责了帝国主义者和国内反动派的反共运动。他说，帝国主义和反动派甚至可以把塞斯佩德斯（1868年古巴人民独立战争中的民族领袖）和阿格拉蒙特（十九世纪的古巴民族英雄）解放也称为共产党人。卡斯特罗谴责了美国和古巴贸易中的不平等关系。他说，在最近两年里，古巴在同美国的贸易中损失了十亿美元。
    卡斯特罗在抨击美国对拉丁美洲国家的政策时指出，美国仍然坚持它过去对拉丁美洲一贯的看法，其后果将是悲惨的。他说，这种政策是一个表明了它的失败的政策，它应该由这样一个政策来替代，这就是，对拉丁美洲人民来说，这个政策意味着它们在自己的经济基础上而不是在美国剩余资本的输出市场上得到发展。
  卡斯特罗也指责了美国的“军事援助”。他指出，美国运来的武器仅仅是为了加强惯于依靠武力来夺取政府的那一小撮人。
