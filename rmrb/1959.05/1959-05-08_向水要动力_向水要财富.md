To Get Power from Water, To Get Wealth from Water
	Wang Huating, First Secretary of the Pingdu County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party

	Pingdu County is located in the northern part of Shandong Peninsula, with the Daze Mountain area, which is rich in longan grapes, in the northeast, plains in the central part, and low-lying areas in the south. The county has more than 2.8 million mu of arable land; there are more than 90 rivers of all sizes, the groundwater level is shallow, water resources are abundant, and the soil is fertile. However, during the past reactionary rule, the terraced fields in the mountains were destroyed, the rivers in the plains were neglected, and the poor mountains and bad waters caused disasters year after year. Even in a good year, the yield per mu was no more than a hundred catties or so. For many years, farmers have been living in hunger and cold.

	After liberation, the Party rescued the broad masses of working people from disaster and began a new life. In the past few years, we have led the people in the mountainous areas to build valley weirs, dams on the mountainsides, terraced fields, fish scale pits, and mountain springs; in the plains, we have worked on large-scale raised fields, drilled machine wells, built reservoirs, dug spring-fed rivers, and fundamentally controlled rivers; in the waterlogged areas, we have vigorously engaged in ditch and raised field projects. Now the county has completely treated the 1.4 million mu of waterlogged land left over from before liberation, controlled soil erosion area of 620 square kilometers, accounting for 81.5% of the soil erosion area, and the irrigation area has reached more than 2.1 million mu, greatly changing the natural features of poor mountains and bad waters. Especially since the Great Leap Forward last year, according to the Party's comprehensive water management policy, the Pingdu County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has put forward the grand fighting slogan of "getting power from water and getting wealth from water," pooling the water from the sky, underground, and rivers for comprehensive utilization, so that it can serve the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production.

	"Treasure Trove"

	In managing mountains and rivers and developing the use of groundwater, we have implemented the policy of combining each other, overall planning, and comprehensive utilization, not only using it for irrigation, but also using it for power generation and developing sideline production. For example, in combination with mountain management and river damming, more than 3,000 water storage reservoirs have been built, storing a total of more than 83.8 million cubic meters of water. This water has not only played a great role in spring irrigation, enabling most of the county's one million mu of wheat to be irrigated in a timely manner, but also built 14 hydropower stations and three hydroelectric power stations, creating conditions for rural electrification. And use this water to raise fish, raise ducks, grow lotus roots, grow cattails, grow reeds, etc.

	The Hongqi Commune cut off the Xian River, which runs through the central part of the county, from the Zijingshan Valley, and built the Shuangmiao Reservoir with a water storage capacity of 5.5 million cubic meters. It now raises 150,000 fish, with an average weight of more than one and a half catties per fish. Next to the reservoir, 11 fish fry breeding farms have been established, which can breed more than 7 million fish fry every year, which will meet the county's fish fry needs. At the southern end of the reservoir, a 10-kilometer-long main canal has been built, which can gravity-irrigate 30,000 mu of fertile land. Because the natural slope of the irrigation area is relatively large, taking advantage of this favorable condition, seven small hydropower stations and water power stations have been built. Two hydroelectric power stations have already started supplying electricity, allowing more than 500 households in five villages to use electric lights. Five water power stations are also used for flour milling, sawing wood, cotton ginning, and cotton batting. The largest one uses a vertical automatic mill, which can grind 10,000 catties of flour a day. The power generated by these seven stations can replace the labor of 300 people and 300 livestock every day. A few young girls watching a mill can supply the flour needed for thousands of people to eat.

	The Huangtong Reservoir, which was recently completed, is several times better than the Shuangmiao Reservoir. It has an area of ​​5 square kilometers and can hold 40 million cubic meters of water. It can not only completely block and store the water in the upper reaches of the Huangtong River to avoid flooding, but also is a good measure to fundamentally control the Dagu River and Xiaogu River. The water from the reservoir can irrigate 150,000 mu of land, raise 1 million fish, and raise 20,000 ducks. At the same time, lotus flowers will be planted in the reservoir, and thousands of mu of Laiyang pears will be planted around the reservoir and on the slopes and river banks. There are also plans to build a 100-kilowatt hydroelectric power station here, so the broad masses call these reservoirs "treasure troves."

	"Spring-fed River"

	How to develop gravity irrigation in the plains? This is a problem that has not been solved for many years. In 1959, on the basis of mechanization of wells, and with the specific help of the higher authorities, the construction of spring-fed river projects was carried out on a large scale, solving this problem. Li Gezhuang dug a river channel with a total length of 3,100 meters and a depth of 6 meters from the high slope to the low-lying area. Twenty-four underground springs were drilled upstream, and clear water gurgled out. At first, it was a small stream, but little by little, it accumulated and merged into a river channel with a flow rate of 0.3 cubic meters per second downstream, gravity-irrigating more than 10,000 mu of fertile land. This is the spring-fed river. The spring-fed river uses river gates and canal gates to store water and develop production such as fish farming and duck raising. And using the natural drop, a 3-kilowatt small hydropower station was built, allowing more than 70 households in Shilibao and Daijiazhuang to use electric lights for lighting. More than 40,000 trees of various kinds have been planted along the banks of the spring-fed river, including peach trees, locust trees, willows, and apples. The spring water, through the diversion canal, not only turns the groundwater into warm water, which is suitable for crop growth, but also saves a lot of manpower, materials, and financial resources. The power generated by this spring-fed river alone saves more than 50,000 labor days throughout the year. Three such projects have been started throughout the county, and the principle of building and using them at the same time has been implemented, playing a huge role in current agricultural production.

	One Bridge for Three Uses, Three Waters for Joint Use

	When the aqueduct siphon passes through the river channel, we combine it with projects such as intercepting underflow and building bridges and culverts to achieve one bridge for three uses. To the south of Qilihe Village in Hongqi Commune, the bridge over the Xian River should be connected to meet the needs of the increasing transportation tasks. The aqueduct siphon of the Shuangmiao Reservoir channel also needs to pass through the river channel here, so these two projects are combined with the Xian River interception underflow project for construction. This achieves three goals with one effort and achieves twice the result with half the effort. According to this experience, 13 underflow interception projects have been carried out throughout the county, developing gravity irrigation to a total of more than 90,000 mu. At the same time, we combined storing rainwater, digging groundwater, and diverting river water to create a method of combining three waters and developing gravity irrigation by combining thousands of small waters into a large river. For example, the Xian River interception underflow project in Hongqi Commune diverts the underflow of the river out of the riverbed through a diversion canal, making it gravity-irrigate, and uses the water drop to build water-powered waterwheels and water-powered water pumps. In order to supplement the lack of water flow in the dry season, a branch canal was opened from the main canal of the Shuangmiao Reservoir, making it connected to the underflow canal, and the river formed by mountain springs with perennial water flow also flows into the underflow canal. The confluence of these three waters makes the canal water flow all year round, forming triple insurance and fully leveraging the role of the three waters of the sky, ground, and underground. It will never be affected by natural disasters such as drought and flood, and can guarantee farmland water even if it does not rain for a year.

	Now, based on the existing experience of comprehensive water management and comprehensive utilization, we are making the county's mountains, hills, and plains develop towards automation and diversification in an all-round way, so that water can benefit the people according to their will.

　　向水要动力　向水要财富
    中共平度县委第一书记　王华亭
    平度县位于山东半岛的北部，东北是盛产龙眼葡萄的大泽山区，中部系平原，南部低洼。全县可耕地达二百八十多万亩；境内大小河流九十多条，地下水位较浅，水源丰富，土地肥沃。然而，在过去反动统治时期，山区梯田破坏、平原河流失修，穷山恶水，连年成灾。遇上个好年头，每亩产量也不过百十来斤。多少年来，农民一直生活在饥寒交迫之中。
    解放后党把广大的劳苦人民从灾难中拯救出来，开始了新生。几年来，我们在山区领导人民修谷坊、闸山腰、修梯田、挖鱼鳞坑、开山泉；在平原地区，搞大地畦田、打机井、修水库、挖泉组河、根治河流；在涝洼地区，则大搞沟洫畦田等工程。现在全县已把解放前遗留下来的一百四十万亩涝洼地全部治好，已控制水土流失面积六百二十平方公里，占水土流失面积81.5％，灌溉面积已达二百一十多万亩，大大改变了穷山恶水的自然面貌。特别是去年大跃进以来，中共平度县委根据上级党规定的全面治水的方针，提出了“向水要动力，向水要财富”的宏伟战斗口号。把天上、地下和河里的水，汇总起来综合利用，使它为农业生产大跃进服务。
    “万宝库”
    我们在治山治河和发展利用地下水方面，贯彻了相互结合、全面规划、综合利用的方针，不仅要用它灌溉，而且要用它发电和发展副业生产。例如结合治山、闸河，修建了三千多处蓄水库，共蓄下了八千三百八十多万公方的水。这些水不仅在春灌中大大发挥了作用，使全县一百万亩小麦大部得到了适时灌溉，同时又建起了十四座水力站，三座水电站，为农村电气化创造了条件。并且利用这些水养鱼、养鸭、种藕、种蒲、种苇等。
    红旗公社从紫景山谷将纵贯全县中部的现河拦腰斩断，建成一座积水五百五十万公方的双庙水库，现已养鱼十五万尾，平均每条鱼重达一斤半以上。在水库一旁又建立了十一个鱼种繁殖场，每年可繁殖鱼苗七百多万尾，将能满足全县鱼种需要。水库的南端，修建了一条长达十公里的干渠，可自流灌溉三万亩良田　因灌区自然坡度较大，抓住这一有利的条件，修建了小型水电站和水力站七座。两处水电站已经开始送电，使五个村的五百多户人家用上了电灯。五处水力站也同时用于磨面、锯木、轧花、弹花等生产。最大的一处水打立式自动磨，一天可磨面粉一万斤。这七个站所发出的动力，每天能顶上三百个人和三百头牲畜的劳动，几个小姑娘看着一盘磨，就能供上千把人吃饭所需要的面。
    最近竣工的黄同水库，又胜过双庙水库数倍。它的面积五平方公里，能容水四千公方，既可以把黄同河上游的水完全拦蓄起来，以免泛滥成灾，又是根治大沽河、小沽河的良好措施。利用水库的水可以灌溉十五万亩地，养鱼一百万尾，养鸭二万只，同时在库中栽上荷花，水库四周和山坡、河岸栽上几千亩莱阳梨，还计划在这里建立一座一百瓩的水电站，所以广大群众称赞这些水库为“万宝库”。
    “泉组河”
    怎样发展平原地区的自流灌溉？这是多少年来没有解决的问题。1959年在机井化的基础上，在上级的具体帮助下，大搞泉组河工程，解决了这个问题。李戈庄从高坡到低洼，顺势挖了一条全长三千一百公尺，深六公尺的河道，上游打了二十四眼地下泉，同时潺潺的冒出清水，开始是一个小水流，但积少成多，到下游便汇成了流量达零点三秒公方的河道，自流灌溉一万多亩良田。这就是泉组河。泉组河通过河道闸和渠道闸，把水蓄起来，发展养鱼、养鸭等生产。并利用自然落差，建成了三瓩的小型水电站一处，使十里堡、代家庄的七十多户人家用上电灯照明。沿泉组河两岸又种植了各种树木四万多棵，有桃树，有槐树，有杨柳，还有苹果。泉水通过引渠不仅把地下水变成了温水，适于作物生长，而且大量节省了人力、物力和财力，这一处泉组河所产生的动力全年即节省劳力五万多个。像这样的工程全县已搞起三处，而且都贯彻了边建边用的原则，在当前农业生产中，发挥了巨大的作用。一桥三用，三水并用
    当水渠导虹吸管穿过河道时，我们把它和截潜流、修建桥涵等工程结合起来，达到一桥三用。红旗公社七里河村南，应该把现河的桥架通，才能适应日益增多的运输任务的需要。而双庙水库渠道的导虹吸管也需要在这里穿过河道，于是把这两处工程和现河截潜流工程结合进行施工。这样一举三得，收到事半功倍的效果。全县根据这一经验，已搞截潜流工程十三处，发展自流灌溉共达九万多亩。同时我们结合蓄天上水、挖地下水、引用河水创造了三水并用，千条小水汇成大河发展自流灌溉的办法。例如红旗公社现河截潜流工程通过引水渠，把河流潜层水引出河槽，使之自流灌溉，并利用水的落差建设了水力水车、水打水泵。为了补助枯水季节水流的不足，又将双庙水库干渠开了一个支渠，使它通向潜流水渠，而常年流水的山泉汇成的河流也流入潜流渠道。这三水汇流使渠水四季长流，形成三保险，充分发挥了天上、地面、地下水的三水并用的作用。它将永远不受旱涝等自然灾害的影响，一年不下雨也可以保证农田用水。
    现在我们根据已有的全面治水、综合利用的经验，正在使全县山区、丘陵、平原全面向自流化、多样化发展，使水按照人们的意志为人民造福。（附图片）
