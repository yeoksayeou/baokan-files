    Vigorously Grasp Ironmaking Raw Materials to Ensure High Output from Blast Furnaces
    Anshan Iron and Steel's Ironmaking, Sintering, and Coking Coordination Rapidly Increases Pig Iron Daily Output
    (Our newspaper's Anshan dispatch, 26th) The Anshan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and Anshan Iron and Steel Company concentrated their superior strength on grasping the production of raw materials and coke, vigorously supporting ironmaking, enabling the daily pig iron production level of the ironmaking plant to rise rapidly.
    Since the end of April, a new situation of comprehensive leap forward in production has already emerged at the Anshan Iron and Steel Ironmaking Plant, and it is especially prominent in May. According to statistics up to the 20th, the average daily output of the entire plant was 1,118 tons more than in April, and 2,955 tons more than in January and February; the utilization coefficient of the ten large blast furnaces averaged 1.633, an increase of 0.135 compared to April, and the qualified rate of pig iron increased by 0.34% compared to April. Production costs have also been reduced, with a total cost reduction of 160,000 yuan compared to the first half of April.
    The production process of large blast furnaces at the Anshan Iron and Steel Ironmaking Plant is quite complex, requiring not only the interconnection between various processes within the plant, but also close cooperation from plants and mines producing ore and coke. If any aspect goes wrong, it will affect the output and quality of pig iron. Since December of last year, due to the poor quality of sintered ore and coke, coupled with problems in ironmaking operations, the plant's production has been abnormal. In order to reverse this situation, the Anshan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and Anshan Iron and Steel Company began concentrating their superior strength on grasping the production of raw materials and coke in February this year, vigorously supporting ironmaking. At the same time, the ironmaking plant also proactively sought support from brother plants and mines. Ironmaking workers sent representatives to visit brother plants and mines, publicizing the great significance of improving the quality of sintered ore and coke for increasing the production of high-quality iron to support steelmaking. They also invited workers from sintering and coking units to visit the blast furnaces, explaining the various difficulties that poor-quality sintered ore and coke would bring to blast furnace ironmaking. Through mutual visits and understanding of each other's needs and difficulties, the cooperation between the two sides was strengthened. For example, after workers in the Second Coking Workshop of the Chemical Complex learned that their coke strength was low, affecting the improvement of the utilization coefficient of the No. 9 blast furnace, they designed and manufactured a roller screen themselves, allowing the produced coke to pass through the screen once more, increasing the coke strength from around 310 kg to over 320 kg.
    From leading cadres to workers, mines, sintering plants, coking plants and other plants and mines have established the idea of serving ironmaking. In order to ensure that the blast furnace is well-fed and well-nourished, a competition centered on meeting the needs of ironmaking production was also launched, continuously improving the quality and quantity of sintered ore and coke, especially the improvements since April.
    While cooperating with raw material production units to change the conditions of ironmaking raw materials, the Anshan Iron and Steel Ironmaking Plant also actively promoted advanced experiences such as increasing smelting intensity and reducing coke ratio from a subjective standpoint, rapidly changing the face of production. Increasing smelting intensity and reducing coke ratio have been proven to be effective ways to increase pig iron production at Benxi No. 1 Iron and Steel Plant. After debate, Anshan Iron and Steel Ironmaking Plant workers gradually learned and implemented this important operational experience since February. After mastering this advanced experience, the red banner workers fighting on the No. 9 blast furnace broke through the 2.0 mark for the blast furnace utilization coefficient in the first week of April, leading the way among the plant's large blast furnaces. Other blast furnaces in the plant quickly caught up, setting off a heated competition climax. Since the raw material and coke conditions greatly improved in late April, the plant's smelting intensity increased from 1.009 in March to 1.049, averaging 1.058 in the first twenty days of May; at the same time, the coke ratio decreased from 0.685 in March to 0.669, and further decreased to 0.652 in the first half of May.
    In order to further improve the level of production, increase the production of more and better pig iron, and meet the needs of steelmaking, the Anshan Iron and Steel Ironmaking Plant, while continuing to carry out intra-plant cooperation, recently signed inter-plant cooperation competition contracts with units such as the Sintering Plant, the Chemical Complex, the Power Plant, and the Transportation Department to ensure further strengthening of production cooperation between plants.

### 大抓炼铁原料  保证高炉高产  鞍钢炼铁、烧结、炼焦大协作  生铁日产量迅速提高

    大抓炼铁原料  保证高炉高产
    鞍钢炼铁、烧结、炼焦大协作  生铁日产量迅速提高
    本报鞍山26日电  中共鞍山市委和鞍山钢铁公司集中优势力量，抓原料和焦炭的生产，大力支援炼铁，使炼铁厂生铁日产水平迅速上升。
    从4月下旬起，鞍钢炼铁厂生产全面跃进的新局面就已经出现，5月份尤为突出。截至20日的统计，全厂平均日产量比4月份多产铁一千一百十八吨，比1、2月份多产铁二千九百五十五吨；十座大型高炉的利用系数平均达到一点六三三，比4月份提高零点一三五，生铁合格率比4月份提高0.34％。生产成本也降低了，同4月上半月比较，共降低成本十六万元。
    鞍钢炼铁厂大型高炉的生产过程相当复杂，它不仅要求厂内各个工序之间互相衔接，而且也要求生产矿石、焦炭的厂矿紧密配合。哪一方面出了问题，都要影响生铁的产量和质量。去年12月份以来，由于烧结矿和焦炭的质量不够好，加上炼铁操作上存在的问题，全厂生产一直不够正常。为了扭转这种局面，今年2月份开始，中共鞍山市委和鞍山钢铁公司曾集中优势力量抓原料和焦炭的生产，大力支援炼铁。与此同时，炼铁厂也主动地争取兄弟厂矿的支援，炼铁职工派出代表去兄弟厂矿慰问，宣传提高烧结矿和焦炭的质量对增产优质铁支援炼钢的重大意义；同时还邀请烧结、炼焦单位的职工到高炉上来参观，向他们讲解如果烧结矿、焦炭的质量差，就会给高炉炼铁带来的种种困难。通过互相访问参观，了解彼此的需要和困难，双方的协作加强了。如化工总厂第二炼焦车间工人，知道他们的焦炭强度低，影响九号高炉利用系数的提高以后，便自己设计制成滚筛，让生产的焦炭多过一次筛，把焦炭强度从三百一十公斤左右提高到三百二十公斤以上。
    矿山、烧结、炼焦等厂矿，从领导干部到工人，都树立起为炼铁服务的思想。为了保证高炉吃得饱，吃得好，还开展了以满足炼铁生产需要为中心的竞赛，不断地提高烧结矿和焦炭的质量和数量，特别是4月份以来改进得尤为显著。
    鞍钢炼铁厂在和原料生产单位协作配合，改变炼铁原料条件的同时，还从主观上积极推行提高冶炼强度、降低焦比等先进经验，迅速改变了生产面貌。提高冶炼强度和降低焦比，在本溪第一钢铁厂已经证明是增产生铁的有效途径。鞍钢炼铁厂职工经过辩论，2月份以来逐步学习和贯彻了这项重要的操作经验。战斗在九号高炉上的红旗手们，熟练地运用这项先进经验以后，4月第一周，一举突破高炉利用系数二的大关，在全厂大型高炉中遥遥领先。全厂其他高炉急起直追，掀起了一场火热的竞赛高潮。从原料、焦炭条件大大改善的4月下旬起，全厂冶炼强度从3月的一点零零九提高到一点零四九，5月头二十天平均达到一点零五八；在这同时，焦比从3月的零点六八五降低到零点六六九，5月上半月更降低到零点六五二。
    鞍钢炼铁厂职工为了更进一步提高生产水平，增产更多更好的生铁，满足炼钢的需要，在继续开展厂内协作的同时，最近又同烧结厂、化工总厂、发电厂、运输部等单位，签订了厂际协作竞赛合同，以保证进一步加强厂与厂之间的生产协作。
