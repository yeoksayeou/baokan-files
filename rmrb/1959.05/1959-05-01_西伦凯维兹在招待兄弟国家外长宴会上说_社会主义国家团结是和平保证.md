Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, April 29th. Polish Premier Cyrankiewicz held a grand banquet on the evening of the 28th to entertain the foreign ministers of the Warsaw Treaty Organization member states and China, who are attending the foreign ministers' conference.

Among those present at the banquet were Polish party and government leaders such as Gomulka, Polish Minister of National Defense Spychalski, prominent figures from all walks of life in Poland, and diplomatic envoys from various countries to Poland.

The entire Chinese military goodwill delegation, headed by Marshal Peng Dehuai, was also invited to attend the banquet.

In his speech at the banquet, Cyrankiewicz extended a warm welcome to the foreign ministers attending the foreign ministers' conference and to Marshal Peng Dehuai, who is visiting Poland. He said that we are very pleased that the foreign ministers' conference of great significance is being held in Warsaw. Warsaw is the first place to suffer Hitler's aggression, the place where the Polish people fought for freedom, a symbol of war destruction, and a symbol of peace. The Warsaw Foreign Ministers' Conference is proof of the solidarity of socialist countries and a proof of our demand for easing international tensions. Poland, thanks to its solidarity with socialist countries and its friendship with the Soviet Union, China, and other socialist countries, feels completely different now than it did before the war. He said that we are willing to strengthen this solidarity because it is the guarantee of our security and the guarantee of world peace.

Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko thanked the Polish side on behalf of the foreign ministers. He said that the foreign ministers are meeting here to achieve a consensus on their position before the Geneva conference. He said that our policy is to help ease international tensions. In his speech, Gromyko condemned the measures taken by some countries in the North Atlantic bloc to aggravate international tensions before the Geneva conference. He pointed out that concluding a peace treaty with Germany and resolving the Berlin issue are the most important issues at present.

    苏联外交部长葛罗米柯代表各国外长对波兰方面表示感谢。他说，外长们在这里开会，是为了在日内瓦会议前取得立场的一致。他说，我们的政策是帮助缓和国际紧张局势。葛罗米柯在讲话中谴责了北大西洋集团的某些国家在日内瓦会议前采取的加剧国际紧张局势的措施。他指出，缔结对德和约和解决柏林问题是目前最重要的问题。
