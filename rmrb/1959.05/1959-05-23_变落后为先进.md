    Turning Backwardness into Advancement
    An Ji

    In early April, Comrade Yao Zhen, the Secretary of the Lai'an County Committee in Anhui, went to Huangqiao, a backward production team in the Leding Commune. He didn't just take a look and leave; instead, he stayed and earnestly helped with the work. The cadres and members of this team had always been puzzled because their work and production were poor, and leaders from above rarely visited. When they saw the County Committee Secretary come to help solve problems, they were overjoyed and their confidence increased greatly. The County Committee Secretary helped them summarize their experiences, and then assisted in formulating a production plan through consultation. After the labor force was rationally arranged, the enthusiasm of the masses for production gradually increased. The once-desolate production team quickly became a lively and bustling scene.

    This event shows that leading cadres at all levels should pay special attention to backward communes and teams, and actively help them change their old ways.

    Grasping the key points to drive the general is a well-known and effective leadership method. Grasping the advanced to lead the backward, grasping the middle to lead the two ends, and grasping the backward to catch up with the advanced are several different aspects of this working method. These aspects are interconnected and each has its own emphasis. The time to use a particular method depends on the development of the work situation and the specific local conditions at that time. It should not be generalized. For example, in the autumn and winter of 1957, when the masses still had many ideological concerns about whether agricultural production could achieve a great leap forward, we should have used more of the method of grasping the advanced in order to liberate the minds of the masses, inspire their enthusiasm, and strengthen their confidence. This was indeed the case. Due to the adoption of this working method in various places, an unprecedented production upsurge emerged in the vast rural areas in 1958. However, when the production upsurge has already risen and the minds of the masses have been liberated, merely grasping the advanced is no longer fully suited to the needs of the work. It is necessary to promptly shift the focus of leadership to grasping the backward or the middle, so as to promote the overall development of the entire work. Some comrades often only pay attention to grasping the advanced. The more advanced the communes and teams, the more frequently the leading cadres visit, the more specific their guidance, and the more material support they receive. The communes and teams where work and production are not doing well are neglected. There are many reasons why the work of a commune or team is advanced or backward, and why economic development is fast or slow. One of the important reasons for the formation of "backwardness" is that the higher authorities grasp less, visit less, or even do not grasp or visit at all. Isn't the case of the Huangqiao team a clear illustration of this?

    Turning backward communes or teams into advanced communes or teams, and promoting the overall development of the work, is the desire of the masses and a fundamental sign of doing a good job. Leaders at all levels should promptly improve and enhance their working methods in accordance with the development of the situation. At present, generally speaking, the focus of leadership should be placed on relatively backward areas. We must be good at turning backwardness into advancement, and thereby promote the continuous progress of the advanced.

    In backward communes and teams, there are many old and new problems that urgently need to be solved. The methods to solve these problems and the power to change the backward situation lie within the masses of these communes and teams. We should help commune members see all the favorable conditions from the analysis of the actual situation and enhance their confidence in doing a good job and achieving good production. We must not adopt an evasive attitude towards various difficulties, but rather mobilize the masses of commune members to discuss them thoroughly, find ways to solve them, and turn unfavorable factors into favorable ones. Some problems (such as insufficient funds or seeds) that cannot be solved within the commune or team should be the responsibility of the leadership to help solve.

    Of course, while actively helping backward communes and teams change their appearance, we should also pay attention to leading the communes and teams in the middle and the advanced communes and teams. At all times, we should grasp both the key points and lead the overall situation, and grasping the key points is precisely to drive the overall situation.

    变落后为先进
    安纪
    安徽来安县委书记姚震同志，4月初去到雷定公社一个落后的生产小队——黄桥小队。在那里他不是看看就走，而是住了下来认真地帮助工作。这个小队的干部和社员一向因为工作生产都不好，上面的干部又不常去，很有些纳闷；一旦见到县委书记来帮助解决问题，心里就乐滋滋的，信心倍增。县委书记帮助他们总结了经验，又采用商量的方式协助制定出生产计划，合理安排了劳动力以后，群众生产情绪就逐步高涨起来，原先冷冷落落的一个生产队，很快就出现了热气腾腾的景象。
    这件事说明，各级领导干部应当特别关心落后的社和队，积极帮助他们改变旧面貌。
    抓住重点，带动一般，是大家熟知的有效的领导方法。抓先进、带落后，抓中间、带两头，抓落后、赶先进，是这个工作方法的几个不同的方面。各个方面互有联系而又各有重点。在什么时候运用什么方法进行工作，要看工作发展的形势和当时当地的具体情况而定，不能一概而论。例如1957年秋冬，当群众对农业生产能不能大跃进还有许多思想顾虑的时候，就应该多采用抓先进的工作方法，以解放群众思想，鼓舞群众热情，坚定群众信心。事实果然如此。由于各地采取这种工作方法，1958年广大农村里便出现了一个空前未有的生产高潮。但是，当生产高潮已经起来，群众思想已经解放以后，如果仅仅抓先进，就不能完全适合工作的需要，必须及时地把领导的重点放在抓落后或抓中间方面来，这样才能使整个工作全面地向前发展。有些同志往往只注意抓先进，越是先进的社队，领导干部去的越多，指导也越具体，物质支持也较多。而工作和生产搞得不好的社队，则被忽略了。一个社或队的工作先进或落后，经济发展快或缓慢，原因很多；上级抓得少，去得少，甚至不抓不去，是形成“落后”的重要原因之一。黄桥小队的前前后后不就是一个清楚的说明吗？
    把落后的社或队变成先进的社或队，使工作全面地向前发展，是群众的愿望，也是作好工作的一个根本标志。各级领导应该根据形势的发展及时地改进和提高自己的工作方法。在目前，一般地说，应该把领导重点放在比较落后的地方。要善于变落后为先进，并以此促使先进的不断前进。
    在落后社、队里，急待解决的老问题新问题都是不少的。解决这些问题的办法和改变落后局面的力量，就在这些社、队的群众中间。应当帮助社员从对实际情况的分析中看到一切有利的条件，提高搞好工作、搞好生产的信心。对各种困难不能采取回避的态度，而要发动社员群众好好讨论，设法解决，把不利因素变为有利因素。有些问题（例如资金种子不足等）实在不能在社、队内部解决时，应当由领导上负责帮助解决。
    当然，在积极帮助落后社、队改变面貌的时候，也还应该注意领导中间状况的社队和先进的社队；任何时候都应该既抓重点又带全面，抓重点也正是为了带动全面。
