My New Life
Speech by Committee Member Xue Yu

Chairman, fellow committee members:

I am a person who committed serious political errors and became guilty of opposing the Party, opposing the people, and opposing socialism. I would like to talk about my understanding and experience of the Party's policy of educating and reforming rightists. Due to my limited level, my understanding is insufficient, and may even be wrong. Please criticize and correct me.

I. I believe that for a rightist to achieve a complete transformation, thoroughly reform themselves, and truly start anew, the first step is to recognize their own mistakes, that is, to accept the label of rightist wholeheartedly. Only by truly recognizing one's mistakes and sincerely accepting them can one be thoroughly reformed and start anew. Otherwise, if one accepts it superficially but not in one's heart, or pretends to accept it, then the reform will only be verbal, not in thought and stance. "True acceptance" is not simple, but requires painful and repeated struggles. For example, when I was labeled a rightist and subjected to criticism and struggle, I couldn't accept it and had great resistance, so I thought of many reasons to cover up my mistakes.

I believed that I had always followed the Party and supported the Party, and that I had always been a leftist. How could I suddenly become an anti-Party, anti-socialist rightist? It is inevitable for a person to have some shortcomings and mistakes in their work, which at most are just issues of work style and ideological understanding. Giving opinions to the Ministry of Health was to improve work and to care for the cause of pharmacy; the motive was good and the heart was kind. I had no organization, no plan, and the publication of erroneous articles was passive. Subjectively, I had no intention of opposing the Party; it may have been "a momentary slip." To put it mildly, it was at most "an unintentional fire." But how could that be considered anti-Party? Therefore, I initially refused to admit that I was an anti-Party, anti-socialist rightist and thought that there might be a mistake.

I am grateful to the Party for educating me during the anti-Rightist struggle, and thanks to the criticism and help from comrades, as well as repeated self-reflection and self-struggle, I made a detailed examination of all my words and deeds since the Party's rectification campaign, which made my mind clearer. I repeatedly reflected and asked myself, what was the content of my articles and speeches? What was the purpose? Who benefited? And what was my stance? For example:

1. "Pharmaceutical workers have not been liberated, have not been emancipated, and cannot see the sun," calling on pharmaceutical workers to rise up and "pour out their grievances." Isn't this slander against the Party, an attack on the Party? "Pouring out grievances" is a term used by peasants to struggle against landlords. By calling on pharmaceutical workers to rise up and "pour out their grievances" against the Party and the people, what stance was I taking? This was not just losing one's stance, but fundamentally standing on a reactionary stance, harboring class hatred, and even appearing to have deep hatred.

2. In the name of a People's Representative, when I inspected hospital pharmacies, I first looked for shortcomings, believing that the bigger and more numerous the shortcomings, the better. I described the hospital pharmacies as hell on earth. I used the so-called "shortcomings" in hospital pharmacies to attack the Ministry of Health, without asking about achievements. Was this still caring for the Party and the people's pharmaceutical cause? Exaggerating shortcomings and ignoring achievements, who was I serving and who benefited? Moreover, I even hinted to pharmacy staff to strike during the inspection. What was my intention? Was this caring for the people's health care?

3. I slandered the Party-led Ministry of Health as being laymen in pharmacy, not understanding pharmacy, and unable to lead pharmacy. I believed that only I was an expert in pharmacy, and only I could lead pharmacy. I even wanted to monopolize everything related to the pharmaceutical cause.... Wasn't this an attempt to overthrow the Party's leadership in pharmacy and usurp the Party's leadership in pharmacy?

4. After the rightist Chu Anping's fallacy of "the Party's world" was published, workers and peasants across the country rose up to defend the Party, refuting this absurd fallacy in newspapers and struggling against it. The People's Daily, based on the will of the people, published the editorial "Why is this?" on June 8th, but I thought the editorial was premature and detrimental to airing views. What was my stance? Was I sympathizing with the people or opposing the people?

Judging from the results of these few self-reflections, was I an anti-Party, anti-socialist rightist? Undoubtedly, I was an unadulterated, complete rightist. The reason I didn't admit it was because I was standing on the bourgeois, anti-Party, anti-people rightist stance, with no change whatsoever. It was impossible for me to recognize that my words and deeds were anti-Party and anti-people, and it was inevitable that I wouldn't admit it. Only after recognizing that my stance was wrong did I resolve to change my stance, and only then did I initially recognize that I was a bourgeois rightist. I felt infinite pain, feeling that I had failed the Party's years of education and cultivation, and that I was truly biting the hand that feeds me. I realized that the only way out for me was to sincerely bow my head to the Party and the people, confess my crimes, and start anew. Therefore, at the Beijing People's Congress, I laid bare my crimes of opposing the Party and the people, confessed, expressed sincere repentance, and accepted reform.

Does this mean that I have a thorough understanding of my mistakes, and that I am truly and completely convinced without any problems? No.

II. Reform is not easy, but repeated, arduous, and complex. Especially for someone like me, who is an extreme bourgeois individualist, the recurrence of reform is particularly strong. For example:

1. Before and after the handling of the rightists, because I had not yet completely recognized the seriousness of my mistakes, my thoughts fluctuated again. First, I thought that the few erroneous articles I published were written at the request of the heads of Health News and Pharmaceutical Bulletin. The opinions were also raised because others encouraged me to stand up and speak. I shouldn't bear the sole responsibility for investigating the responsibility, and it was unfair to punish me alone. Secondly, since rightists are enemies of the people, they should be given the punishments of "killing," "imprisoning," "controlling," and "educating" according to the severity of their crimes. Which punishment should I receive? "Killing" seemed too heavy; "educating" seemed too light; probably "imprisoning" or "controlling." My mind was full of wild thoughts and restless. Before the handling, I studied Comrade Deng Xiaoping's "Report on the Rectification Movement," and realized that the Party's principle in dealing with rightists should be a combination of seriousness and leniency. The struggle should be thorough politically and ideologically, but the handling should not be excessive, so as to continue to differentiate and reform the rightists, but it should not be infinitely lenient, blurring the lines between the enemy and ourselves and between right and wrong. Later, I thought that I also had the possibility of being treated leniently, so my heart was temporarily calmer. But soon after, thoughts arose in my mind: "If I am removed from my position and asked to do copying work, I can't do it," "What if my salary is reduced too much and I can't support my family?" On the eve of the handling, I suddenly received a notice from the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress to attend the Fifth Session of the First National People's Congress. Thanks to the Party's education, although I did not have a thorough understanding of my mistakes, I still had a certain understanding. At that time, I thought that I was an enemy of the people, but the people did not abandon me, but instead asked me to attend the National People's Congress. I was very touched and couldn't help but shed tears. At the same time, the thoughts "maybe my mistakes are not serious enough" and "maybe my pharmaceutical work still needs me" appeared. But I immediately reflected and asked myself, was this "cocking my tail"? So I sobered up again. It can be seen that the inferior nature of me, a bourgeois individualist who is afraid of loss and gain, is not easily completely eradicated.

2. After receiving the Party and the people's most lenient treatment, although I realized that this was the Party teaching me to study and reform well, I also thought that the handling was the final decision. After the final decision, I would be a long-term enemy of the people. Could I still be reformed? Who would believe me in the future? The Party must no longer believe me, and the masses of the people certainly would not believe me. I felt that the label of rightist was as heavy as Mount Tai, and that there was no future for me from then on. This life was over. I had all kinds of pessimism and despair, so I was all negative. For example, during the self-reform Great Leap Forward movement last year, I was very moved at the time, and I also wanted to leap forward in self-reform, but I thought that since I was a rightist, no one would believe me no matter how well I spoke. Therefore, I hesitated to formulate a self-reform leap forward plan, and I felt very distressed. This situation was discovered by my lover, who asked me if I had formulated a reform plan. I replied: "Who believes the words of a rightist? It's useless to formulate one." She encouraged me and said: "Regardless of others, just ask yourself if you really have the determination to accelerate self-reform." I said: "You don't know the pain of a rightist." She reminded me: "The Party and the people have never said that rightists cannot be reformed. Didn't Premier Zhou say that the door to socialist reform is always open to rightists? I'm afraid it's that you don't believe in the Party and the people, rather than the Party and the people not believing in you..." These words strengthened my confidence and determination in self-reform, and gave me the courage to formulate a plan for self-reform.

This shows that it is not easy to reform a person, and it is also repeated. To be thoroughly reformed, one must constantly struggle against oneself. One must consciously carry out continuous self-revolution, and at any time and any place, one must be vigilant against the recurrence of bourgeois and old ideological consciousness. One cannot relax even for a moment. If one relaxes occasionally, it will rise up like a demon, creating trouble and even devouring oneself.

III. Through this rectification and anti-Rightist movement, I have deeply realized that the Party's policy of educating and reforming rightists is wise and correct, and it has saved me. The Party proceeds from the interests of the 600 million people, and it is selfless. Struggling against rightists is to educate rightists, so that they can reflect and consciously thoroughly reform and start anew. Saving rightists is to transform the negative into the positive, so that rightists can enter the socialist door as soon as possible and carry out self-reform. When rightists are willing to accept reform, the Party encourages them to accelerate reform, return to the ranks of the people, and contribute to socialist construction. Through the Party's education, I have a relatively clear understanding of my mistakes. The fact that I opposed the Party and socialism is ironclad. I accept the label of rightist willingly and sincerely. In particular, through the movement of confiding in the Party, I saw my dark side from my own confiding materials. Through the study of the General Line, I realized that rightists are the agents of the three major enemies, which made me even more convinced. This education is unprecedented for me. In the past, I always considered myself progressive politically, and I also considered myself an expert professionally, so I was proud, complacent, arrogant, and individualistic. If I had not been educated by this rectification and anti-Rightist campaign, I don't know what deep abyss and pit of fire I would have fallen into if I had continued to develop. Thinking about it now, I can't help but shudder!

1. My study and reform in the Socialist Academy for the past year has enabled me to make a more thorough review of my life's thoughts and words and deeds, which has further clarified my true face, thus giving me a direction and path for self-reform.

Before entering the Socialist Academy, I heard a series of reports from Vice Minister Xu Bing, Mayor Peng Zhen, Vice Premier Chen Yi, and others, pointing out that the Party extended a saving hand to rightists, and also pointing out that the way out for rightists is to accept reform and start anew. But whether rightists can be reformed and whether they are willing to accept reform depends on the rightists themselves. This is another encouragement and education for rightists, which has strengthened my confidence and determination in reform a hundredfold. As soon as I entered the Socialist Academy, I first heard Vice President Nie say: "The Party welcomes rightists to reform, and rightists must also reform, but they must understand why they should reform and for whom they should reform." This was another alarm bell for me. I originally thought that studying and reforming in the Socialist Academy was to remove my rightist label as soon as possible, and I did not have the idea of reforming to serve the people and serve socialism. After hearing these words, I clarified the purpose of studying and reforming, thus correcting my attitude towards learning.

2. The Party has given me the most lenient treatment, neither demoting me nor reducing my salary, and has given me better and more favorable conditions so that I can concentrate on research work. It has also given me the opportunity to study and reform and certain political treatment. I am not only a member of the Central Committee of the Jiu San Society, a democratic party, but also a member of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC). This is another opportunity for the Party to give me to study and reform. I truly feel that the Party is my re-created parent. When I made mistakes, it gave me serious criticism and struggle politically to make me reflect, recognize my mistakes, and thoroughly reform. This is a strict father. When I admitted my mistakes, expressed repentance, and was willing to reform, the Party gave me the opportunity to study and reform and constantly urged me to study well and reform seriously. This is a kind mother. I am determined to return to my parents' arms and never leave again, always relying closely on the Party's teachings and constantly reforming myself. First, I will use the six political criteria instructed by Chairman Mao as my goal for reform, and then gradually move to the left and constantly self-revolutionize, demanding and reforming myself according to the standards of a Party member.

When I attended the First Session of the Third National Committee of the CPPCC and attended the First Session of the Second National People's Congress as an observer, I saw Chairman Mao leading the opening of the conference, like a sun shining with infinite light on me. My blood boiled, and my excitement was indescribable. I deeply thanked the Party for giving me such a good opportunity to study and reform. I was determined to study and reform well and thoroughly. I heard the reports of Premier Zhou, Vice Premier Li Fuchun, and Vice Premier Li Xiannian, which made me extremely happy and inspired. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the leader of the Chinese people, our great motherland has achieved unprecedented brilliant achievements in socialist construction and socialist revolution. The happy and prosperous socialist and communist society with infinite beauty is not a distant picture in our country, but a society that can be expected in due course. How proud and proud it is to be a person of the new China! How happy and joyful it is to live in the era of Mao Zedong! The infinitely magnificent and beautiful scenery of the new China has inspired my soaring enthusiasm for work and increased my infinite power for self-reform. The past sixty years have been wasted. It has not been without any effect, but it has had a counterproductive effect. The past me is dead. Today is my new life. I am determined to thoroughly reform myself under the leadership and education of the Party. I will no longer fail the Party's trust and education. I am determined to thoroughly sweep away my bourgeois stance, ideology, worldview, and outlook on life, etc. I will steadfastly, closely, and loyally follow the Party and dedicate all my remaining time, strength, and life to the construction of socialism and communism.

### 我的新生  薛愚委员的发言

专栏：

　　我的新生
    薛愚委员的发言主席、各位委员：
    我是在政治上犯了严重错误，成为反党、反人民、反社会主义有罪行的人，我想谈一谈我对党对右派分子教育改造政策的一点认识和体会。限于自己的水平，认识是很不够的，甚至是错误的，请同志们批评和指教。
    一、我认为一个右派分子要做到脱胎换骨，彻底改造自己，真正地重新做人，首先是认识自己的错误，也就是戴上了右派帽子服不服。只有真正地认识了自己的错误，真心诚意地服了，才能彻底改造，重新做人。否则口服心不服，或者假服，而改造也只能口头上的，而不是思想上和立场上的。“真服”并不是简单的，而是要经过痛苦的、反复的斗争的。例如当我划为右派，对我进行批判斗争时，我就接受不了，抵触情绪很大，从而想了许许多多理由来掩盖自己的错误。
    我认为自己一向是跟着党走，是拥护党的，自己从来就是左派，怎能一下子就变成反党、反社会主义的右派分子呢？一个人在工作上有某些缺点和错误，是免不了的，最多也只是些工作作风和思想认识问题。给卫生部提意见，是为了改进工作，是爱护药学事业，动机是好的，心是善良的。我既无组织，也无计划，写文章发表谬论，又是被动的，主观上我毫无反党的意图，可能是“一时不慎失足”，提高一点，最多也只是“无意失火”。可能是火燃烧的大一点罢了，那能算是反党呢？因此，我最初不肯承认自己是反党反社会主义的右派分子。而认为可能是搞错了。
    感激党在反右斗争中教育了我，又加上经过同志们的批判和帮助，以及自己反复地自我反省和自我斗争，把自己从党整风以来的一切言行，作了详细检查，从而使我的头脑比较清醒了一些。反复反省自问，写文章和发言的内容是什么？目的是为了什么？是对谁有利？立场又是什么？例如说：
    1、“药工人员没有解放，没有翻身，见不到太阳”，号召药工人员起来“吐苦水”。这不是诬蔑党，向党进攻，又是什么？“吐苦水”是农民斗争地主用的字眼，而我号召药工人员起来向党向人民“吐苦水”，是站在什么立场？这不是丧失立场，而是根本站在反动立场，是有阶级仇恨，而且还像是仇恨很深似的。
    2、我借人民代表名义，视察医院药房时，首先是找缺点，并且认为缺点越大越好，越多越好，把医院药房描写成人间地狱。拿着医院药房中我所谓的“缺点”向卫生部进攻，而毫不问成绩。这难道还是爱护党、爱护人民的药学事业吗？夸大缺点，不问成绩，是为谁服务与谁有利？况且在视察药房时还示意药房人员罢工，这是什么企图，是爱护人民保健事业吗？
    3、诬蔑党领导的卫生部对药学是外行，不懂药学，不能领导药学，认为只有我才是药学内行，只有我才能领导药学，并且想把所有有关药学事业的一切，都霸占起来……。这是不是企图在药学上想推翻党的领导，而篡夺党在药学上的领导权？
    4、当右派分子储安平的“党天下”谬论发表后，全国工人、农民纷纷起来捍卫党，在报上驳斥这种荒谬的谬论，而与之斗争。人民日报根据全国人民意志于六月八日发表了“这是为什么”的社论，而我却认为社论过早，有碍于鸣放。这又是什么立场？是同情人民还是反人民？
    只就这几点反省的结果看，我是不是反党反社会主义的右派分子呢？毫无疑问地，是不折不扣，十足的右派分子，而所以不承认，是由于自己站在资产阶级反党反人民的右派立场，丝毫没有转变，不可能认识自己的言行是反党反人民的，不肯承认，也是必然的。认识到自己的立场错了，因而才下决心改变自己的立场，才初步认识到自己是资产阶级右派分子，才感到无限的痛心，感到辜负了党多年来对我的教育和培养，真是恩将仇报，从而认识到只有真诚地向党向人民低头认罪，重新做人，才是自己的唯一出路。因此，在北京人民代表大会上，把我反党反人民的罪行，和盘托出，作了交代，表示诚心悔过，接受改造。
    这是不是对自己的错误有了彻底的认识，真正的、完全口服心服而毫无问题呢？不是的。
    二、改造不是很容易的，而是反复的，艰巨的和复杂的，特别像我这样的人，是一个资产阶级极端个人主义者，改造的反复性表现更是特别强烈。如：
    1、在处理右派前后，由于还未彻底认清自己错误的严重性，思想又波动起来了。首先认为自己发表的几篇谬论，是健康报和药学通报负责人要求我写的。提意见也是别人鼓励我站起来讲的。追究责任，我不能独负，处分我一人，是不公平的。其次，右派分子既是人民的敌人，理应按罪行的轻重程度的不同，分别予以“杀”、“关”、“管”、“教”的处分，我应受那一种处分呢？“杀”似乎过重；“教”又似乎过轻；大概是“关”或“管”罢，心中胡思乱想，动荡不安。在处理前，学习了邓小平同志“关于整风运动的报告”，认识到党对于右派分子的处理，原则应该是严肃与宽大相结合，政治上思想上要斗透，处理上则不宜过分，以便对右派分子继续分化和改造，但是也不能宽大无边，混淆了敌我界限和是非界限。后认为自己也有得到宽大处理的可能性，因而心中一时又比较平静些。可是思想上不久又发生了：“假若撤了我的职，叫我去搞抄写等工作，我是干不了的”，“工资过于降低，不能维持全家生活那又怎么办呢？”正在处理的前夕，忽然接到人大常委会通知我参加人代第一届第五次大会，由于党的教育，对于自己的错误，虽认识的不够彻底，但还是有了一定的认识，当时自思是人民的敌人，人民未抛弃我，反而叫我参加人代大会，非常感动，不禁流下了眼泪，同时，另一方面又出现了“可能是我的错误不够严重”，“可能是药学工作上还需要我”的思想。但我立刻又反省自问，这是不是在“翘尾巴”呢？于是又清醒过来了。可见我这种资产阶级个人主义者患得患失的劣根，并不是很容易完全根除的。
    2、在得到了党和人民最宽大的处理后，虽然认识到这是党教我很好的学习改造，可是我又认为处理就是定案，定案后就久远成为人民的敌人，还能改造吗？今后还有谁肯相信我呢？党一定对我不再相信了，人民群众当然更不相信我了，感到右派帽子重如泰山，从此再没有前途了，今生算完了。种种悲观失望，从而一切消极。如去年在展开自我改造大跃进运动中，当时甚为感动，也很想在自我改造上跃进一下，但是又想到既是右派分子，再说得好，也没有人相信。因此，迟迟不敢制定自我改造跃进计划，心中非常苦闷。这种情况被我的爱人发现，就问我制定了改造计划没有？我回答说：“右派分子的话有谁相信？订了也是白订。”她鼓励我说：“不管别人，只问自己有没有真正加速自我改造的决心。”我说：“你不知右派分子的苦痛。”她提醒我说：“党和人民从来没有说过，右派分子不能改造。周总理对右派分子不是说过社会主义改造大门永远是开着的吗？恐怕是你不相信党和人民，而不是党和人民不相信你……。”这些话使我加强了自我改造的信心和决心，鼓起了勇气，才制定自我改造的计划。
    由此可以说明一个人要改造是不容易的，也是反复的。要想彻底改造好，就要对自己作不断的斗争，一定要自觉地进行不断的自我革命，随时随地要对资产阶级的、旧的思想意识复发性，提高警惕，一时一刻也不能放松，偶尔一放松，它就要像恶魔一样，起来兴风作浪，甚而吞噬了自己。
    三、经过这次整风反右运动，使我深刻地体会到党对右派分子教育改造的政策是英明正确的，使我得到了挽救。党是一切从六亿人民利益出发，是大公无私的。斗争右派分子，是教育右派，使他们反省自觉，彻底改造，重新做人。挽救右派，是要化消极为积极，使右派分子早日进入社会主义大门，进行自我改造。当右派分子愿意接受改造时，党就给以鼓励，使他们加速改造，回到人民队伍里，为社会主义建设贡献出一分力量。我对于自己的错误，经过党的教育，认识是比较清楚了，反党反社会主义是铁的事实摆在面前，戴上右派帽子，是口服心服的，特别是经过向党交心运动，由自己的交心材料，看清了自己的黑暗面；经过总路线的学习，认识到右派分子是三大敌人的代理人，更使我口服心服了。这对我的教育，是史无前例的。过去，在政治上总是自认是进步的，在业务上又自封为专家，因而骄傲自满，狂妄自大，个人至上。如果不经过这次整风反右给我以教育，再发展下去，真不知要堕到什么深渊火坑里，现在想起来，真是不寒而栗！
    1、我在社会主义学院学习改造，一年来使我能够把自己一生的思想和言行，做了一次比较彻底的清理，使我更进一步认清了自己的真面目，从而有了自我改造的方向和途径。
    在进社会主义学院以前，听到徐冰副部长、彭真市长、陈毅副总理等一系列的报告，指出党对右派分子伸出了挽救之手，同时，也指出右派分子的出路是接受改造，重新做人。但右派分子能不能改造，愿不愿接受改造，取决于右派分子自己。这又是对右派分子的鼓舞和教育，使我改造的信心和决心从而百倍地加强了。一入社会主义学院，首先听到聂副院长说：“党欢迎右派分子改造，右派分子也必须改造，但要认识为什么要改造？和改造为谁？”这又是对我敲了一下警钟，我原来想到社会主义学院学习改造，是为了早日摘掉自己的右派帽子，并没有改造为人民服务和为社会主义服务的思想。听了这番话后就使我明确了学习改造的目的，从而端正了学习态度。
      2、党既对我作了最宽大的处理，既不降级也未减薪，并且给我更好的有利条件，使我更安心进行研究工作。又给了我学习改造的机会和一定的政治待遇，我不仅任民主党派九三学社的中央委员，又光荣地任政协全国委员会委员，这是党又一次给我学习改造的机会。我真正地感觉到党是我再生父母。当我犯了错误时，在政治上对我进行严肃的批判和斗争，使我反省，认识错误，彻底改造，这就是严父；当我承认错误，表示悔过，愿意改造时，党又给我学习改造的机会，并时时督促我好好地学习，认真地改造，这就是慈母。我决心回到父母的怀抱里，永远不再离开，永远紧紧地依靠党的教导，不断地改造自己。首先根据毛主席指示的六项政治标准为自己改造目标，进而步步向左不断自我革命，以党员的标准要求自己和改造自己。
    当我参加政协全国委员会第三届第一次大会，列席全国人民代表大会第二届第一次大会时，看见了毛主席领导大会开幕，有如光芒万丈的太阳照到了我，我的血液沸腾起来了，我的心情的激动无法形容，我深深地感谢党给我这样好的学习改造机会，我决心好好地，彻底地学习和改造。听到了周总理、李富春副总理和李先念副总理的报告，使我无比地欢欣鼓舞，我们伟大的祖国在中国共产党和全国人民的领袖毛主席领导下，社会主义建设和社会主义革命，都获得了史无前例的辉煌成就。幸福的，繁荣的社会主义和共产主义无限美好的社会，在我国不是什么遥远的图景，而是有期可待了。作一个新中国的人民，是多么骄傲自豪！活在毛泽东的时代，是多么愉快幸福！新中国无比宏伟瑰丽的美景，鼓起了我工作上的冲天干劲和增加了我自我改造的无限力量。过去六十年是白白的过去了，不是未起什么作用，而是起了反作用。过去的我已经死亡了，今天是我的新生，我决心在党的领导和教育下彻底自我改造。不再辜负党对我的信任和教育，决心把自己的资产阶级的立场、思想、世界观和人生观等等肮脏的东西，彻底扫光，我坚决不移地、紧紧地、忠心地跟着党走，把自己剩余的时光、力量和生命全部贡献出来，为社会主义和共产主义建设而奋斗。
