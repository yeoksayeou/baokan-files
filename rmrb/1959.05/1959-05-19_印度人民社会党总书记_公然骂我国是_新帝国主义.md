Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, May 18th: According to the Indian Press Trust, the General Secretary of the Indian Praja Socialist Party, Goray, once again delivered a speech slandering and attacking China at a public gathering held yesterday at Shivaji Park in Bombay. He clamored that the large influx of Tibetan "refugees" into India demonstrates that Tibetans oppose China's rule over Tibet.

According to a report in the "Times of India," Goray, in this speech, even went as far as to insult China as "new imperialism." He said that India and other Asian and African countries suffered greatly and struggled against Western imperialism's rule. They understand the nature of that imperialism very well. However, the nature of the "new imperialism" that has now emerged is different. Its army is described as a "liberation army," and its rule over a nation is described as "liberation from the shackles of upper-class reactionaries." He said that Tibet is the latest "victim" of this "new imperialism."

This leader of the Praja Socialist Party, who has been the most zealous in anti-China activities by exploiting the Tibetan rebellion, also said that Indians cannot remain indifferent to events happening in the world, because freedom is indivisible. They are even more unable to remain indifferent to what is happening in a "country" like Tibet, because Indians have close relations with Tibetans, and Tibet is their "neighbor."

He said that Indians also hope that Tibetans can prosper, and for this, they should carry out social reforms in that "country," but that is a task for the Tibetans themselves to complete. They should have the opportunity to develop and prosper freely.

Goray also attacked the policies of the Communist Party of India in his speech.

    印度人民社会党总书记
    公然骂我国是“新帝国主义”
    新华社新德里18日电　据印度报业托辣斯报道，印度人民社会党总书记戈拉伊昨天在孟买希瓦季公园举行的公众大会上又一次发表了污蔑和攻击中国的讲话。他叫嚣说，大批西藏“难民”流入印度表明，西藏人反对中国对西藏的统治。
    另据“印度时报”报道，戈拉伊在这次讲话中曾经辱骂中国是
  “新帝国主义”。他说，印度和其它亚非国家在西方帝国主义的统治下，曾经遭到很大苦难，并且同它斗争。它们非常了解那种帝国主义的性质。但是，现在出现的“新帝国主义”的性质不同，它的军队被说成是“解放军”，它对一个民族的统治被说成是“从上层反动分子的桎梏下解放出来”。他说，西藏是这个“新帝国主义”最新的“牺牲者”。
    利用西藏叛乱事件进行反华活动最为卖力的人民社会党的这个领袖还说，印度人对于世界上发生的事件不能置之不理，因为自由是不可分割的。他们更加不能对像西藏这样的“国家”中正在发生的事情置之不理，因为印度人同西藏人有着紧密的关系，西藏是他们的“邻邦”。
    他说，印度人也希望，西藏人能够繁荣，而为此，他们应当在那个“国家”里进行社会改革，但是那是要西藏人自己完成的任务。他们应该有机会自由地发展和繁荣。
    戈拉伊在讲话中还攻击了印度共产党的政策。
