    新华社莫斯科5日电　今天，苏联广泛地庆祝一年一度的出版节。
    目前苏联共有七千六百六十八种报纸，共发行五千七百万份。在1958年，苏联全国还出版了二千七百七十七种集体农庄小报。苏联共有八百种杂志，共发行二千九百万份。
    随着报刊发行数量的增长，苏联新闻工作者的队伍正在日益扩大。参加苏联新闻工作者协会的人数已经达到一万八千人。全苏第一届新闻工作者代表大会最近即将在莫斯科开幕。
    近年来苏联报刊在苏联共产党的领导下，在宣传马克思列宁主义理论、宣传苏联对内和对外政策，以及在组织群众性劳动竞赛和宣传先进生产经验方面，都取得了巨大的成绩。
    苏联报刊作为苏联共产党的有力的思想武器，正在完成着动员劳动人民提前完成七年计划和用共产主义精神教育人民群众的光荣任务。
