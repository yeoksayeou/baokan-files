Jinan Dispatch from Our Newspaper, May 20th: Shandong Province is mobilizing all levels to tackle the high-sulfur issue in a solid and down-to-earth manner, rapidly improving both the quality and output of pig iron. The qualification rate of pig iron was only around 30% in February, but it has now reached 67%, with a peak of about 70%. Production has steadily increased, with the total output in April rising by 2.8% compared to the previous month. The average daily output from the 1st to the 10th reached 3,933.8 tons, an increase of 13.27% compared to April. Costs and coke ratio have also significantly decreased.

An important reason for the increase in pig iron quality and output in Shandong Province is that the vast number of workers, from the Provincial Party Committee to the grassroots units of iron smelting, have regarded improving quality as a top priority in steel production. In February, the Shandong Provincial Party Committee conducted a comprehensive inspection of pig iron quality and found that it was far from meeting requirements. Subsequently, it held two special meetings and a radio conference for the secretaries of the prefectural and municipal Party committees and the heads of metallurgical bureaus, emphasizing the need to concentrate efforts on breaking through the quality barrier. Various regions also held meetings for the secretaries, factory directors, and furnace foremen of counties and factories. Through in-depth and meticulous ideological mobilization at all levels, everyone established a solid quality concept, and a red flag competition movement centered on high quality and high output was launched vigorously in all steel units throughout the province. This competition developed most rapidly in Jinan City. Secretaries, factory directors, and other responsible persons in charge of steel production went to the front of the blast furnaces, directing and operating alongside the workers, and studying methods to reduce high sulfur content. After only forty days of combat, the qualification rate of pig iron reached 84.7%. The Provincial Party Committee promptly promoted the experience of Jinan City, establishing a "pace-setter" throughout the province, which further deepened the movement for high quality and high output.

The Provincial Party Committee adopted a series of resolute and effective measures to promote the earnest efforts of various regions to improve pig iron quality. At the beginning of the movement, quality standards were first issued: the sulfur content of ore should be lower than 0.2%, with a maximum of 0.5%; the sulfur content of coke should be between 0.6% and 0.8%, and should not exceed 1%; pig iron quality that does not meet national standards will not be counted as part of the task, and will not be allowed to leave the factory or be transferred externally. The vast number of workers conscientiously implemented the decisions of the Provincial Party Committee and adopted various methods to achieve the requirements of the Provincial Party Committee. According to chemical analysis, a large portion of the sulfur content in pig iron comes from coke. Therefore, the province uniformly implemented clean water coal washing during coking, basically ensuring that raw coal is not coked without being washed with water. The method of "open-flame pool" coking was stopped, and "Kailuan pool" coking with covers was used, which not only reduced the sulfur content of coke, but also reduced the ash content, greatly improving the quality of coke. Various regions also devised many methods for processing raw materials such as ore. Before the ore enters the furnace, it is graded by size, carefully selected, and roasted. Different batching ratios are used according to the different sulfur and iron content of the ore. Many places have also formulated regulations that furnace materials must be selected, dried, and cleaned before entering the furnace, achieving the requirement of "making fine products from coarse grains," so that the small blast furnaces are "fed" well.

Another important measure to ensure high quality and high output of small blast furnaces is that various regions have universally established chemical analysis institutions and technical inspection organizations, adding "scouts" and "supervisory posts" for small blast furnaces. To help various regions overcome difficulties in equipment and personnel, the Provincial Metallurgical Bureau specially convened an on-site meeting to exchange experiences and promote instruments such as the locally made "sulfur determinator," and trained personnel for various regions. Changwei Prefecture manufactured its own local equipment and medicines, and cultivated technical forces by adopting short-term training classes and using experienced workers to train new ones, quickly establishing a chemical analysis team. Currently, they can ensure that general chemical analyses are not performed outside the factory, and higher-level chemical analyses are not performed outside the county. Some regions have also established technical inspection sections and special commissioners to be responsible for inspecting the quality of products and raw materials, which plays a significant role in ensuring quality improvement.

In the process of attacking high sulfur content, Shandong Province comprehensively promoted effective experiences such as parallel fan connections, multi-nozzle combustion, and using quicklime instead of limestone as a solvent, greatly increasing the air volume and temperature of small blast furnaces, and significantly strengthening the desulfurization efficiency in the furnace. Various regions have paid great attention to solidifying advanced management experiences and operating procedures, and institutionalizing them, to ensure the stability of production and the improvement of quality. After the Yantai Iron and Steel Plant implemented the "four fixings and four adjustments" operating procedures on No. 1 thirteen-cubic-meter blast furnace, namely "fixed charging system, adjust material line; fixed ore batch, adjust coke batch; stable air volume, adjust air temperature; stable slag ratio, adjust slag amount," this blast furnace has been in continuous production for more than eight months. The utilization coefficient reached a maximum of 1.73, and the sulfur content of pig iron in March was reduced to 0.0616%, far exceeding the national standard.

In the most recent period, Shandong Province has decided to further concentrate its efforts on highlighting quality on the basis of the continuous steady increase in output, in order to strive to increase the pig iron qualification rate to about 85% by the end of June, and provide more and better pig iron for key steel enterprises.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, May 20th: The Hebei Provincial Metallurgical Bureau, at a recent provincial pig iron quality inspection meeting, requested that employees in the province's iron smelting system take various measures to strive to break through the pig iron quality barrier in the shortest possible time.

More than 80 representatives from major iron and steel plants in the province who were in charge of production management and chemical analysis attended the meeting. Focusing on the central topic of improving pig iron quality, they widely exchanged experiences, formulated specific measures to improve pig iron quality, and decided to take prompt action to strive for a pig iron qualification rate of over 70% in the province in May and 90% in the fourth quarter. Blast furnaces with a volume of 55 cubic meters or more must eliminate sub-standard iron, and strive for a 100% pig iron qualification rate.

The measures to improve pig iron quality formulated at the meeting were: 1. Every factory must adopt the method of combining leadership and the masses in the increase production and practice economy movement to carry out a mass quality inspection. Through inspection, find the key problems and solutions that affect quality. 2. The quality of pig iron largely depends on the sulfur content and impurities in the raw materials. Therefore, each factory must work hard to control raw materials. Coking coal must be washed and selected to ensure that the sulfur content of local coke does not exceed 1%, and the sulfur content of foreign coke is below 1%, ensuring that coking coal is not coked without being washed and selected, and coke with high ash content and high sulfur content does not enter the blast furnace. In terms of ore, we must vigorously promote the experience of roasting, carry out external desulfurization, and increase the iron content of the ore. At the same time, each factory must actively prepare materials to prepare for rainy season production. 3. Quality assurance contracts must be signed in the entire production process, such as mining, transportation, crushing, and charging into the furnace, and between each process. Workers must be mobilized to conscientiously summarize advanced operating experience and formulate operating procedures and necessary systems for slag making, air supply, chemical analysis, and quality inspection. 4. Continue to promote the technical transformation experience of small blast furnaces. After implementing parallel fan connections to increase air volume, each factory is required to conscientiously promote multi-nozzle combustion and transform the hot blast stove to increase the air temperature to 650 to 700 degrees.

Shandong is transferring large quantities of high-quality pig iron to support the production of key steel plants. In early May, 20,757 tons of pig iron had been transferred. This is the Jinan Iron Factory loading large quantities of high-quality pig iron onto trucks for external transport. Xinhua News Agency reporters Jiang Zhi and Li Hanxiao

    上下齐动手　矿焦求精细　技术大革新　检验更严格
    山东河北力攻生铁高硫症
    本报济南20日电　山东省上下齐动手，扎扎实实地猛攻高硫关，生铁质量、产量双双迅速提高。生铁合格率2月份只有30％上下，目前已达到67％，最高曾达70％左右；产量稳步上升，4月份的总产量比前一月提高2.8％；而1日到10日的平均日产量达到三千九百三十三点八吨，又比4月份提高了13.27％；成本和焦比也显著降低。
    山东省的生铁质量、产量上升的重要原因，是从省委直到炼铁基层单位的广大职工，都把提高质量作为钢铁生产中一项头等重要的任务来完成。2月间，中共山东省委对生铁质量作了一次全面的检查，发现质量远不能合乎要求；随即接连召开了两次地、市委工业书记、冶金局长的专门会议和广播大会，强调集中力量突破质量关。各地区也分别地召开了县、工厂的书记、厂长、炉长会议。经过深入、细致的层层思想发动，使大家树立起牢固的质量观念，一个以优质、高产为中心内容的红旗竞赛运动，就在全省所有钢铁单位轰轰烈烈地开展起来。济南市的这项竞赛运动发展得最为迅速；各部门负责钢铁生产的书记、厂长等负责人，都深入到高炉前，边指挥、边操作，与工人一起研究降低高硫的办法。只经过四十天的战斗，生铁合格率就达到84.7％。省委及时地推广了济南市的经验，在全省树立起“标兵”，使得优质、高产的运动进一步深入发展。
    省委采取了一系列坚决、有力的措施，促使各地切切实实地努力提高生铁质量。运动开始时，首先颁发了质量标准：矿石含硫量要低于0.2％，最高不得超过0.5％；焦炭含硫量要在0.6％—0.8％之间，不能超过1％；生铁质量不符合国家标准的一律不算任务，不准出厂，不准外调。广大职工认真贯彻省委的决定，采取各种办法实现省委的要求。据化验分析，生铁的含硫量有很大一部分是从焦炭中带进去的。所以，这个省在炼焦时一律实行了清水洗煤，基本上做到原煤不经水洗不装窑烧炼；停止“明火池”炼焦的方法，使用“开滦池”加盖炼焦，这样就既减低了焦炭的含硫量，又减低了灰分，大大提高了焦炭的质量。对矿石等原料的处理，各地也想了很多办法。矿石入炉前都进行大小块分级、精选、焙烧；根据不同含硫、含铁量的矿石，采用不同的配料比例。好多地方还制定了炉料不选不干不净不入炉的规定，达到了“粗粮细作”的要求，使小高炉“吃”得既饱又好。
    保证小高炉优质高产的另一个重要措施，是各地普遍建立了化验机构和技术检查组织，为小高炉增设了“侦察兵”、“监督岗”。为帮助各地克服设备、人材的困难，省冶金局特地召开了交流经验、推广土“定硫仪”等仪器的现场会议，并为各地培训人员。昌潍专区自己制造土设备、药品，采用短期训练班、以老带新等方法培养技术力量，很快地建立起一支化验队伍。目前，他们已能做到一般化验不出厂，较高的化验不出县。有些地区还专门设立了技术检查科和特派员，负责检查产品、原材料的质量，对保证质量的提高很起作用。
    在向高硫进攻的过程中，山东省全面地推广了风机并联、多嘴燃烧、用生石灰代替石灰石作溶剂等行之有效的经验，使小高炉的风量、风温都大为提高，炉内脱硫效率显著的加强。各地都十分注意把先进的管理经验和操作规程固定下来，并使之制度化，以保证生产的稳定和质量的提高。烟台钢铁厂在一号十三立方公尺高炉上实行“固定装料制度，调整料线；固定矿批，调整焦批；稳定风量，调整风温；稳定渣比，调整渣量”的“四定四调”操作规程后，这座高炉已连续生产八个多月，利用系数最高达到一点七三，3月份生铁的含硫率降低到0.0616％，远远超过国家的标准。
    在最近一个时期内，山东省决定在产量不断稳步上升的基础上，再进一步集中力量突出抓质量，以争取在6月底前把生铁合格率提高到85％左右，为重点炼钢企业提供更多、更好的生铁。
    新华社天津20日电　河北省冶金局在最近召开全省生铁质量检验会议上，要求全省炼铁系统职工采取各种措施，力争在最短时间内突破生铁质量关。
    参加这次会议的有全省各重点炼铁厂的八十多名生产管理和化验方面的代表。他们围绕着提高生铁质量这一中心议题，广泛交流了经验，订出了提高生铁质量的具体措施，并且决定迅速行动起来，力争5月份全省的生铁合格率达到70％以上，第四季度达到90％；容积五十五立方公尺以上的高炉要消灭等外铁，力争生铁合格率达到百分之百。
    会议订出的提高生铁质量的措施是：一、各个工厂要在增产节约运动中采取领导与群众相结合的方法开展一次群众性的质量大检查，通过检查找出影响质量的关键问题和解决办法；二、生铁质量的好坏，在很大程度上决定于原料中含硫量和杂质的高低。因此，各厂要狠狠地抓原料。炼焦煤必须经过洗选，保证土焦含硫量不超过1％，洋焦的含硫量在1％以下，作到焦煤不经洗选不炼焦，焦炭灰分大和含硫高的不入高炉。在矿石方面，要大力推广焙烧的经验，进行炉外脱硫，提高矿石含铁量。同时，各厂要积极备料，为雨季生产作准备；三、要在采矿、运输、粉碎、入炉等整个生产过程中和各工序之间签订保质保量合同，发动工人认真总结先进操作经验，制订操作规程和造渣、送风、化验、质量检查等必要的制度；四、继续推广小高炉技术改造经验，实行风机并联提高风量后，要求各厂认真推行多嘴燃烧，改造热风室，使风温提高到六百五十度到七百度。（附图片）
    山东各地大量外调优质生铁，支援重点钢厂生产。5月上旬已外调生铁二万零七百五十七吨。这是济南铁厂正在把大批的优质生铁装车外运。　新华社记者　姜智、李汉孝摄
