Preventing Wind and Rain from Stealing a Single Grain
Qidong County Battles Rain to Harvest Wheat

(Our dispatch) Hunan's Qidong County has mobilized the masses, rationally arranged labor, and seized the gaps between rains to launch a surprise rush harvest of wheat. More than 13,000 people have been mobilized throughout the county, and more than 3,000 mu of wheat have already been harvested.

Qidong County has more than 60,000 mu of wheat, some of which is already ripe and urgently needs to be harvested in a timely manner. However, since May, there have been continuous overcast and rainy days. In order to protect the grain already in hand, the Qidong County Committee of the Communist Party of China, in addition to immediately convening a telephone conference of commune party committee secretaries and making specific arrangements, also convened a broadcast conference of cadres above the level of work team leader from various communes on the evening of the 9th. It issued a call to seize the gaps after the rain, do everything possible, and launch a surprise rush harvest of wheat, resolutely ensuring that not a single grain is lost due to the overcast rain. These measures were immediately warmly supported by cadres and the masses. From the commune to the production team, leadership backbones were quickly identified to take charge of this work.

The next day, Jinqiao Commune mobilized more than 1,320 laborers to brave the rain and rush harvest 436 mu of ripe wheat.

After the rush harvest, each commune determined threshing and storage methods according to the degree of ripeness. Wheat with hard stalks and low moisture content was piled up in a dry place. Wheat with rotten stalks and high moisture content was threshed in a timely manner and treated by means of air drying, wind drying, and baking. In the Caoyuan Chong Brigade of Guanjiazui Commune, 13 mu of wheat had already lodged and the stalks were rotten, while 23 mu of wheat had not lodged but urgently needed to be harvested. The brigade convened a meeting of experienced farmers and cadres to study how to deal with it. The brigade lacked houses for piling wheat, so the experienced farmer Chen Ansheng proposed that the wheat that had not lodged could be harvested and piled there first. The wheat that had rotten stalks could not be piled and should be threshed immediately and methods should be found to dry it. Based on past experience, commune member Chen Anyong proposed three methods: one is to stir-fry it dry in a pot, the second is to spread it out to air dry, and the third is to bake it dry; it is also possible to weigh the wheat and distribute it to commune members for storage, and then recover it as dried wheat based on the moisture content. After the brigade adopted these methods, the 32 mu of wheat that had been harvested was basically dried and would not germinate and rot.

    不让风雨夺去一粒粮
    祁东县抗雨收麦
    本报讯　湖南祁东县发动群众，合理安排劳动力，抓住停雨空隙，突击抢收麦子。全县出动了一万三千多人，已抢收了三千多亩麦子。
    祁东县六万多亩麦子，有的已经成熟，急需及时收割。但5月份以来，阴雨连绵。中共祁东县委为了保护已经到了手的粮食，除立即召开了公社党委书记电话会，作了具体安排外，9日晚上，又召开了各公社作业组长以上干部的广播大会，提出了抓住雨后空隙，千方百计，突击抢收麦子，坚决不因阴雨损失一粒粮的号召。这些措施，立即受到了干部和群众的热烈支持。从公社到生产队，迅速确定了领导骨干负责领导这一工作。
    金桥公社第二天出动一千三百二十多个劳力，冒雨抢收了四百三十六亩熟透了的麦子。
    抢收回来以后，各公社又按照成熟程度确定脱粒、保管办法。对秆子硬、水分少的麦子，就放在干燥的地方堆起来。对秆子烂了、水分又多的麦子，就及时脱粒，采取晾干、风干、烘干的办法，加以处理。官家咀公社草源冲大队，有十三亩麦子已经倒伏，秆子烂了，还有二十三亩麦子未倒伏，但急需收割，大队便召开老农、干部会研究怎样处理。这个队缺少堆麦的房子，老农陈安生便提出没有倒伏的可以先收回来堆在那里，已经烂了秆的没法堆了，要马上打下来，想法搞干。社员陈安永根据往年经验，提出了三个办法：一是用锅子炒干，二是摊开风干，三是烘干；还可以把麦子过秤后分给社员保管，按湿度折合干麦收回。大队采用这些办法以后，已收的三十二亩麦子已基本上干了，不会发芽霉烂了。
