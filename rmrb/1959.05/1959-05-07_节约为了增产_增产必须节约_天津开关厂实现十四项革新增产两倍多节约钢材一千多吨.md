　　Thrift for the sake of increased production; increased production must be thrifty.
    Tianjin Switch Factory Achieves Fourteen Innovations, More Than Doubles Production, and Saves Over 1,000 Tons of Steel.
    (Our Dispatch) The Tianjin Switch Factory has achieved fourteen major technical innovations in three months, saving the state 1,530 tons of steel, 170 tons of copper, 23 tons of lead, over 100 tons of cast iron, and more than 1.5 million man-hours. Output increased by 2.6 times compared to the same period last year, labor productivity increased by 1.5 times compared to the same period last year, and costs were 8.05% lower than planned.
    The Tianjin Switch Factory used to be a factory that assembled various types of high and low voltage switchboards. This year, in order to support power station construction, it was converted to producing various electrical switch components and batch-matching tasks. The difficulty they encountered in completing this task was a shortage of raw materials, parts, and man-hours. Raw materials and parts were almost half of what was needed, and there was a shortage of more than 400,000 man-hours.
    How to solve the contradiction between the task and the inadequacy of materials? The Party branch of the Switch Factory mobilized the masses of employees to discuss this issue. The common conclusion was: we must start with thrift to carry out the production increase movement, so that the majority of employees understand the relationship that thrift is for the sake of increased production, and increased production must be thrifty. This is the general guiding ideology for them to achieve this year's Great Leap Forward plan.
    Employees were clear that the core content of the production increase and thrift movement should be technical revolution and technical innovation, but there were differences in the specific methods: some people believed that the product model could not be changed, because changing the model would involve a series of changes in the entire process, design, and operating procedures; others believed that the product model was not something sacred and inviolable. Which opinion should be followed? Obviously, following the former method would not achieve a Great Leap Forward, while following the latter opinion might mobilize the enthusiasm of the masses. The leadership supported the latter opinion and announced that as long as quality was guaranteed and it was conducive to increasing production and saving money, the model could be changed. Subsequently, a three-way combination technical innovation committee or group was established from the factory to the workshop and team to guide the development of production increase and thrift. Soon, a competition emerged throughout the factory to propose more suggestions, implement measures faster, and achieve greater results. In three days, the factory proposed more than 1,000 suggestions.
    In order to deal with these suggestions in a timely manner, the factory leadership decided to adopt the "physical dissection" method and clarify the scope of responsibility. The fitter team No. 3 lost a lot of man-hours producing A-5 air switches. They put the components of this switch on the table and calculated the details of each process: the first process was to process the base plate and punch holes. Each base plate had 70 holes, and each hole was punched three times, and each time a drill bit needed to be changed. This auxiliary time was very long, and the production efficiency was not high. This time, the workers passed the base plate around, looked at it, and offered suggestions. This led to a suggestion to use a mold to punch holes and adopt a flow-line production method. In a field test, the working hours were shortened to 40 minutes, and the efficiency was increased by more than six times. Using this method, 13 processes were successively changed, and the processing time was reduced from 36 hours to 12 hours. According to the annual calculation, this improvement alone can save 150,000 man-hours, making up for the original shortage of man-hours.
    New apprentices accounted for 80% of the total number of workers in this factory, and some of them did not fully understand the significance of increasing production and saving money. In order to improve their awareness, the factory held a production increase and thrift exhibition. Combined with the exhibition, they organized new apprentices to hold forums and debates to improve everyone's ideological awareness. At this time, the factory leadership promptly pointed out to the new apprentices that their efforts in the production increase and thrift movement were to focus on key production and save raw materials. The specific measures were eight characters: increase (increase production), change (improve operating methods, change design, process, etc.), substitute (save and substitute raw materials), tap (tap potential), save (save manpower, materials and financial resources), search (collect waste materials), comprehensively utilize (comprehensively utilize raw materials), and manage (participate in production management and cost management, etc.). In this way, the new apprentices clarified the direction and had a good grasp of things. They actively assisted their masters in their work. For example, after the word "substitute" was proposed, they worked with their teachers to successfully test and implement saving and substitution methods such as replacing copper with aluminum, replacing bakelite boards with wooden boards, replacing steel plates with iron wire, and replacing brass with copper, etc. Some people vividly called the word "change" as: change fat heads and big ears, change clumsiness into cleverness. That is, to change the product from high to low and from wide to narrow on the premise of ensuring quality and safety, saving a lot of steel and copper; after the "eight-character" measures were proposed, they also felt that the content of learning, comparing, and catching up was enriched. Now, each workshop, team, and even process has a benchmark and a red flag shock worker. There is a seventeen-year-old girl named Wang Shuzhen in the mutual inductor team. The quota for winding coils is 65 to 70. She initially made 80, and later reached nearly 100. After most others exceeded the quota, she made 125 to 130.
    The production increase and thrift movement of the Tianjin Switch Factory is continuing vigorously.

　　节约为了增产  增产必须节约
    天津开关厂实现十四项革新增产两倍多节约钢材一千多吨
    本报讯　天津市开关厂在三个月内实现十四项较大的技术革新，给国家节约钢材一千五百三十吨，铜材一百七十吨，铅材二十三吨，铸铁一百多吨，人工一百五十多万小时，产量比去年同期增长二点六倍，劳动生产率比去年同期增长一点五倍，成本比计划降低8.05％。
    天津市开关厂，过去是装配各种类型的高、低压开关板的工厂。今年为了支援电站建设，改为生产各种电器开关原件和成批配套任务。他们在完成这一任务中碰到的困难是原材料、部件、工时不足，原材料和部件几乎缺一半，工时差四十多万个。
    任务和材料不相适应的矛盾怎么解决呢？开关厂党支部发动职工群众讨论了这个问题，大家共同得出来的结论是：必须从节约入手开展增产运动，使广大职工了解到节约为了增产，增产必须节约的关系。这就是他们实现今年跃进计划的总的指导思想。
    增产节约运动应以技术革命和技术革新为中心内容，这一点职工是明确的，但具体到作法上却有分歧：有些人认为产品型号不能改，理由是型号一改便牵扯整个工艺，设计和操作规程等一系列的变更；另外一些人则认为，产品型号不是什么神圣不可侵犯的。按照哪一种意见作呢？显然照前一种作法就不能实现大跃进，照后一种意见去办，就可能调动起群众的积极性。领导上支持了后一种意见，宣布只要保证质量，有利于增产节约，型号可以改。接着从工厂到车间、小组，层层建立了指导开展增产节约的三结合技术革新委员会或小组。全厂很快就出现了一个比提建议多、比实现措施快、比收效大的竞赛。在三天中全厂共提出了建议一千多件。
    厂领导上为了及时处理这些建议，确定采取“实物解剖”的方法，并明确责任范围。钳工三组生产A—五空气开关，亏很多工时，他们把这个开关的部件都摆在桌上，逐道工序算细账：第一道工序是加工底板打眼，每个底板七十个眼，每个眼打三次，每打一次需要换一次钻头，这样辅助时间很长，生产效率不高。这次工人们拿着底板传着看，传着提建议，这一来，就提出了改用漏模打眼、采取流水作业生产法的建议。当场一试验，工时缩短到四十分钟，效率提高了六倍多。用这个方法，接连改了十三道工序，加工工时由三十六个降低到十二个，按全年计算，只这一项改进就可以节约十五万个工时，补足了原来的工时亏欠数。
    这个厂新徒工占工人总数的80％，他们之中有的人对增产节约的意义理解不足。为了提高他们的觉悟，厂里举办了增产节约展览会，结合举办展览组织新徒工开座谈会、辩论会，提高了大家的思想觉悟。这时，厂领导上又及时给新徒工指出了他们在增产节约运动中的努力方向是抓生产关键，抓节约原材料，具体措施是八个字：增（增产）、改（改进操作方法、改变设计、工艺等）、代（节约、代用原材料）、挖（挖潜力）、省（省人力物力财力）、搜（搜集废材料）、综（综合利用原材料）、管（参加生产管理、成本管理等）。这一来，新徒工明确了方向，也有抓头了，他们积极协助师傅干了起来，如“代”字提出来以后，他们协同老师傅试验成功了以铝代铜、木板代电木板、铁丝代钢板、黄铜代紫铜等等节约代用办法，有的把“改”字形象地称为：改肥头大耳，改笨生巧。就是把产品在保证质量和安全的前提下，高改成低的，宽改成窄的，节约下好多钢材、铜材；在“八字”措施提出来以后，他们学、比、赶也感到内容丰富了，现在，各车间、小组以至工序，都有了标杆，红旗突击手。互感器小组有个十七岁的姑娘叫王淑珍，缠线圈定额是六十五到七十，她开初作到八十个，后来达到近百个，等别人多数超过定额以后，她又作到一百二十五到一百三十个。
    天津市开关厂的增产节约运动正轰轰烈烈的继续开展。
