Let's talk about dialectics and agricultural production
Hai Bo
Correctly applying the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture requires learning to use dialectics in agricultural production.

1958 was a year of the Great Leap Forward in China's industrial and agricultural production, and also a year in which the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Communist Party, creatively applied materialist dialectics and achieved unprecedented victories. In agriculture, this victory was manifested in a significant increase in production. Of particular significance was our acquisition of a complete set of experiences in eight aspects of agriculture: soil, fertilizer, water (irrigation), density (close planting), seed, protection (plant protection), management (field management), and tools (tool reform). We call these experiences the "Eight-Character Charter" for agricultural production.

The great significance of the "Eight-Character Charter" for agricultural production lies primarily in the fact that it is a systematic summary of the agricultural production experience of China's vast number of farmers over many years. Comprehensively implementing it will be a huge and profound revolution in agricultural technology in China.

The Chinese people are one of the first countries in the world to engage in agricultural production, beginning to cultivate the land thousands of years ago. For thousands of years, China's vast number of farmers have created countless valuable experiences in practice. However, these experiences have long been scattered, unsystematic, and unable to fully发挥 their due role. Often, people only grasped this point and missed another. Therefore, although people had many valuable experiences, they were often passive, even blind, in production. The "Eight-Character Charter" for agricultural production comprehensively summarizes these experiences created by farmers over thousands of years, especially in 1958. People are beginning to correctly understand these important laws in agricultural production, and the power of man to conquer nature is greatly strengthened. This is one of the important reasons why Chinese farmers were able to quickly launch such a widespread agricultural technology reform movement in 1958 and achieve the victory of the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production. As Marx said, once science grasps the masses, it will become a huge material force. The "Eight-Character Charter" for agricultural production is precisely such a science.

However, this does not mean that the "Eight-Character Charter" for agricultural production has been universally and correctly grasped by everyone, and that it is all smooth sailing for various regions to implement the "Eight-Character Charter" and lead the masses in production. This is impossible. Any new thing must go through a process from its occurrence to its development. The "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture is the same. Although it is something created by farmers, it is something new to them when it is improved and then implemented. If used well, it is a magic weapon for agricultural production; if used poorly, it is useless or even harmful, just like medicine. If prescribed correctly, it can cure the disease, but if prescribed incorrectly, it can kill the patient. Therefore, how to correctly lead the masses in implementing this "Charter" is still a major issue of serious significance.

How to correctly apply the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture and fully发挥 its enormous power to serve the Great Leap Forward? The key issue lies in learning to use dialectics in agricultural production.

The Dialectical Relationship of the "Eight-Character Charter" for Agriculture
The relationship of the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture itself is a dialectical relationship. It is a unity of opposites, and each of its items is independent but interconnected.

Take the relationship between close planting and fertilization, for example. As everyone knows, to increase agricultural production, we must try every means to increase the utilization rate of land. Reasonable close planting can increase production. The yield of planting 30,000 seedlings per mu and planting 50,000 seedlings per mu will never be the same. Planting 30,000 seedlings per mu results in a lower utilization rate of the land, while planting 50,000 seedlings per mu results in a higher utilization rate of the land. In other words, the land will have more opportunities to give things to humans. Therefore, close planting must be reasonable. Only reasonable close planting can increase production. This is an objective law. However, crops are like people. People need to eat to live, and they need to eat well to have the strength to work. Crops need fertilizers, water, sunlight, etc., and they need to be sufficient to grow well. If the original planting density was 30,000 seedlings per mu, and 500 dan of fertilizer was just right, then if we now want to plant 50,000 seedlings, 500 dan of fertilizer will not be enough. The fertilizer must increase with the increase in seedlings; otherwise, the rice will not grow well due to insufficient fertilizer, or it will not increase production, or it will increase production very little. Therefore, increasing the degree of close planting must be accompanied by a corresponding increase in fertilizer. Close planting and fertilizer are two different things, but they are interconnected and inseparable. The other items are the same. Water conservancy is the lifeline of agricultural production, so we must vigorously develop water conservancy. To retain moisture, the soil must be loose, which requires deep plowing. With these items of water conservancy, deep plowing, fertilizer, and close planting, we still cannot guarantee a good harvest. If weeding and pest control are not done well after the seedlings grow, the crops will not grow. And in our current situation, the inseparable relationship between tool reform and the above items is particularly obvious. To vigorously develop water conservancy, deeply plow the land, accumulate more fertilizer, close planting, etc., all require more labor. However, we only have so much manpower. In addition to doing agriculture, we also have to run industry. It is impossible to rely solely on increasing the number of laborers. The fundamental solution is to realize the semi-mechanization, mechanization, automation, electrification, etc., of the production process. Therefore, we must vigorously carry out tool reform and conduct a technological revolution.

Not only is the relationship between the eight items of the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture a unity of opposites, but each item within the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture is also full of dialectics.

Take close planting, for example. In the past, many areas in China had a habit of extensive planting and low yield. The most prominent aspect of this habit was sparse planting. For example, the spacing between rice plants and the row width were both more than one foot, and the spacing between cotton and corn plants and the row width were even larger, seriously wasting land fertility and resulting in low yields. Therefore, close planting is needed. But is the denser the better? Of course not. Because land fertility is limited after all, and if it is too dense, there is no ventilation and insufficient light, and the most likely result is not increased production but decreased production. Fertilization is the same. The land and crops must have sufficient fertilizer to grow well and increase production; otherwise, it will be difficult to increase production. Therefore, we must fertilize well, but it is by no means unlimited fertilization. If too much fertilizer is applied or it is applied unreasonably, the crops will still not grow well, and they will still not increase production. For example, in some rice paddies, too much fertilizer is applied, causing the rice to only grow seedlings and not bear ears, or the seedlings are burned by the fertilizer.

All of this shows that the view of the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture and each of its items must be dialectical and comprehensive. In 1958, the fundamental reason why such a huge leap forward appeared in China's agricultural production, with most areas increasing production significantly, was that our Party led the masses to implement the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture from a dialectical point of view, preventing one-sidedness in the work. The reason why some areas failed in this regard was precisely because they did not observe and handle problems comprehensively and interdependently from a dialectical point of view when applying the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture, but treated the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture metaphysically and in isolation. For example, they emphasized large-scale water conservancy construction but ignored deep plowing, and emphasized close planting but planted so densely that the rice seedlings could not breathe. This caused the work to go from one extreme to another, and the result was only failure.

Implementing the "Eight-Character Charter" for Agriculture Requires Seeking Truth from Facts, and Everything Should Shift with Time, Conditions, and Location
So, how can we correctly use dialectics to guide agricultural production? For example, how dense and how much fertilizer are considered reasonable? How can we achieve reasonableness? What is the standard for measuring whether they are reasonable?

Seeking truth from facts and proceeding from the actual situation are the foundation of Marxist dialectics, the starting point for all Marxists to consider problems, and also the main foothold for correctly implementing the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture. Since the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture is a unity of opposing sides, we must make reasonable arrangements for all measures in our work and not neglect one thing for another. When implementing the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture, we must fully base our decisions on local conditions: land, climate, manpower, and material resources. That is to say, things should shift with time, conditions, and location. We cannot mechanically copy the experience of others. For example, in some places, the soil is good, the climate is warm, and there is abundant manpower and material resources, then it may be appropriate to plant 50,000 to 60,000 seedlings per mu, which is called reasonable close planting. If only 30,000 to 40,000 seedlings are planted, it may be conservative. In other areas, due to different conditions, the conditions are worse, and it may be appropriate to plant 30,000 to 40,000 seedlings per mu. Planting more would be too dense and would cause errors. Fertilization is also the same, which must be determined based on soil conditions. If the soil quality here originally contains more potassium, then applying more phosphate fertilizer now would be reasonable and would increase production. Due to different geological conditions there, perhaps applying too much phosphate fertilizer would not only be useless but harmful. All of this shows that we must proceed from the actual local situation when implementing the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture. Only in this way can we truly achieve the goal of increasing production. This is the only correct Marxist attitude. The so-called "reasonable" is to correctly combine universal truth with the objective actual situation of the local area. Without specific circumstances, there is no standard of truth.

The laws of Marxist dialectics also tell us that, on the whole, the development of things is infinite, but in a certain period and under certain conditions, it is finite. The two are related, but they must be strictly distinguished. Therefore, close planting, fertilization, deep plowing, and the increase in planned output, etc., can only be relative and not absolute. If someone wants to plant 5 million seedlings per mu, apply 10,000 jin of chemical fertilizer, deeply plow one zhang, and produce 1 million jin per mu, it will only cause waste and have no other results. We must oppose the dogmatic and metaphysical attitude towards the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture. The essence of this attitude is subjectivism. The characteristics of this attitude are completely opposite to dialectics. The view of the problem is isolated, static, and one-sided, and the problem is absolutized. They do not consider the actual local situation and their own conditions, mechanically copying the experience of other places without any creativity of their own. Those who abandon one measure to achieve another, take care of this piece of land and lose that piece of land, desperately plant densely as soon as they hear that close planting can increase production, thinking that the denser the better, and apply fertilizer limitlessly without regard to objective conditions as soon as they hear that more fertilizer can increase production, are people who belong to this category, and as a result they fail.

Of course, it should be explained that purposefully putting other tasks in a secondary position at a certain time in order to concentrate on tackling a certain task, and then concentrating efforts on another task in another period while putting other tasks in a secondary position, is not a work method of only considering one point and not considering the overall situation. It not only does not violate dialectics, but it precisely conforms to the laws of dialectics, because the development of any thing has its different stages, and each different stage has its main contradictions. Dialectics tells people to correctly understand and find out the main contradictions, and then concentrate efforts to solve them. Only in this way can things move forward better. In addition, bold scientific experiments in a very small area are also worth advocating, and this practice can never be said to be subjectivism.

We have focused on the great significance of seeking truth from facts for dialectics and the importance of correctly implementing the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture. However, anyone who wants to smuggle conservative ideas under the scientific terms of "seeking truth from facts" and "proceeding from actual circumstances," and does not want to carry out a major revolution in agricultural production, is also wrong. Things are constantly developing, and all conditions are constantly changing. The change of one condition will inevitably cause a series of other changes. Our task is to proceed from the current actual situation, try every means to发挥 our soaring revolutionary drive, promote the development of production, and support the growth of new things. Any thought of sticking to old ways and not fully recognizing the subjective initiative of people is incompatible with Marxist dialectics and has long been refuted by the facts of the Great Leap Forward. We should not only be concerned about and promote these changes at all times, but also change our thinking, our plans, and our measures at all times according to the changed situation.

The Mass Line is the Fundamental Method for Implementing the "Eight-Character Charter" for Agriculture
Seeking truth from facts and proceeding from the actual situation to implement the "Eight-Character Charter" for agricultural production, and specifically using dialectics to guide agricultural production, is not only a problem of thought method, but also an important problem of point of view, position, and work style.

As everyone knows, all true scientific theories ultimately originate from objective practice and from the broad masses. Marxism recognizes that the people are both producers and creators of history. Comrade Mao Zedong has repeatedly instructed us that the strength of the masses is the greatest, that we must rely on the masses, believe in the masses, learn from the masses, first be students of the masses, and then be teachers of the masses. Regarding the question of how to rely on the masses and mobilize the masses, Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out in his report to the Seventh National Congress of the Party: "Our congress should call on the whole Party to be vigilant and pay attention to every comrade in every work link, and not let him be divorced from the masses. Educate every comrade to love the people, listen carefully to the voices of the masses; wherever he goes, he should mingle with the masses there, not sit high above the masses, but go deep into the masses; according to the level of awareness of the masses, enlighten and raise the awareness of the masses, and help the masses to gradually organize themselves and gradually unfold all necessary struggles permitted by the internal and external environment at that time and place under the principle that the masses are willing from the bottom of their hearts. In all work, commandism is wrong, because it exceeds the level of awareness of the masses, violates the principle of the masses' voluntary participation, and is prone to acute diseases." (Selected Works of Mao Zedong, Vol. III, p. 1096) Here, Comrade Mao Zedong clearly pointed out the serious significance of learning from the masses and being students of the masses, and the extremely important issue of how to be a good teacher of the masses. At the same time, it also shows that materialist dialectics itself is inseparable from a clear mass viewpoint and a firm proletarian stance.

The "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture was created by the masses, and the main force for implementing this "Charter" is also the broad masses. Only the broad masses have the power to realize it, and only the broad masses of the people are most familiar with agricultural production and are familiar with all the subjective and objective conditions of the local area such as climate, soil quality, manpower, and material resources. The mass line working method is the fundamental method for all our Party's work, and the mass line method must also be adopted in implementing agricultural technology revolution and guiding agricultural production. Only in this way can we seek truth from facts. Therefore, every cadre should have a clear mass viewpoint, a firm proletarian stance, and a working style of going deep into the masses and contacting the masses. Everyone should go deep into the masses to conduct investigation and research, plant experimental fields, and mingle with them, learn from their production experience, listen carefully to their opinions, understand the local conditions from them, and at the same time vigorously mobilize the masses to summarize their production knowledge and experience, and then combine the local conditions to appraise the experience of other places. Whatever is good, whether it is from local or other places, use it; whatever is bad, discard it. When implementing these measures, it is even more important to make them truly come from the "inner willingness" of the masses and obtain the true agreement of the majority of the masses. Only in this way will the broad masses truly grasp technological reform. With the conscious action of the broad masses and the correct leadership of the Party, the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production will become inevitable. And it can be affirmed that as long as this is done, not only will agricultural production increase, but the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture will be further developed and enriched.

Marxist dialectics is playing a huge role in various fields, and its role in agricultural production is also increasing. It can be affirmed that with the continuous improvement and complexity of production technology, the important role of dialectics in this field will become more obvious. The Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong have repeatedly instructed us to study philosophy in order to master the laws of materialist dialectics and work better. In the era of the Great Leap Forward, dialectical materialism has developed and enriched unprecedentedly. We should study even harder to accelerate our great socialist construction.

    谈谈辩证法与农业生产
    海波
    正确运用农业“八字宪法”，必须学会在农业生产中运用辩证法
    1958年是我国工农业生产大跃进的一年，也是我国人民在共产党领导下正确地创造性地运用唯物辩证法取得空前胜利的一年。这种胜利表现在农业方面的是产量的大大增加，特别有意义的是我们取得了关于农业中的土（土壤）、肥（肥料）、水（水利）、密（密植）、种（种子）、保（植物保护）、管（田间管理）、工（工具改革）等八个方面的一整套经验。这些经验我们称它为农业生产的“八字宪法”。
    农业生产“八字宪法”的巨大意义首先在于它是我国广大农民多年来农业生产经验的系统总结，全面贯彻它，将是我国农业技术上的一项巨大深刻的革命。
    我国人民是世界最早进行农业生产的国家之一，远在几千年以前就开始了种田。几千年来，我国的广大农民在实践中创造了无数宝贵的经验，但是这些经验长期以来都是分散的，不成系统，不能充分发挥其应有的作用。往往人们只抓住了这一点，而丢掉了另一点，因此，人们虽有许多宝贵经验，但在生产中在很多情况下仍然是被动的，甚至是盲目的。农业生产“八字宪法”把农民们几千年来特别是1958年创造的这些经验就全面地总结起来了，人们开始正确认识农业生产中的这些重要的规律，人战胜自然的力量是大大加强了。1958年我国农民之所以能迅速掀起规模如此广泛的农业技术改革运动，取得农业生产大跃进的胜利，这是重要原因之一。正像马克思所说的，科学一旦掌握了群众，就会变成巨大的物质力量。农业生产“八字宪法”正是这样一种科学。
    但是这不是说，农业生产“八字宪法”已经普遍地为所有的人正确掌握了，各地贯彻农业生产“八字宪法”和领导群众生产已是万事大吉了。这是不可能的，任何一个新鲜事物从发生到发展都必须要有一个过程，农业“八字宪法”也是如此，它虽然是农民创造的东西，但经过提高再反过来贯彻下去，这对农民来说又是个新的东西。运用得好，它是农业生产的法宝，运用得不好，它毫无用处，甚至有害，正像一副药一样，它下对了可以治好病，如果下错了就要害死人。因此，如何正确领导群众贯彻这个“宪法”，仍然是个有严重意义的重大问题。
    如何正确运用农业“八字宪法”，充分发挥它的巨大威力为大跃进服务？关键问题在哪里呢？关键是必须学会在农业生产中运用辩证法。
    农业“八字宪法”的辩证关系
    农业“八字宪法”本身的关系就是辩证的关系，它是个充满了矛盾的统一体，它的每一项是独立的，但又是互相联系的。
    拿密植和施肥的关系来说吧。大家知道，要使农业增产，就要想尽各种办法增加土地的利用率。合理密植是可以增产的，一亩田栽三万蔸秧和栽五万蔸秧的产量绝不会一样，栽三万蔸秧对土地的利用率就低一些，而栽五万蔸对土地的利用率就高一些，也就是说土地给人类东西的机会就会多一些，因此，必须合理密植，只有合理密植才能增产，这是个客观规律。但是，作物像人一样，人要吃饭才能活命，而且要吃饱吃好才能有力气干活，农作物则需要肥料、水分、阳光等等，而且要充足，才能生长得好。如果每亩地原来栽秧三万蔸，下肥五百担正好，现在要栽五万蔸，还只下五百担肥那就不够了。肥料必须随着秧的增加而增加，否则稻子就会因肥料不足而生长不好，或者不能增产，或者增产很少。因此，增加密植程度，就必须相应地增加肥料，密植和肥料虽是两个东西，但又是互相联系，密不可分的。其他几项也是这样。水利是农业生产的命脉，所以必须大兴水利。要保住水分，必须土质松软，这就又必须深翻土地。有了水利、深耕、肥料、密植这几项，仍不能保证丰收，禾苗长起后的除草、除虫不搞好庄稼也长不起来。而在我们目前的情况下，工具改革与以上几项的关系之不可分割尤为明显。要大兴水利、深翻土地、多积肥、密植等等，都需要更多的劳动力，但我们的人力只有那么多，除了干农业又要办工业，要只指望增加劳动力的数量是不可能的，其根本办法就是实现生产过程的半机械化、机械化、自动化、电气化等等，因此，就必须大搞工具改革，进行技术革命。
    不仅农业“八字宪法”八条之间的关系是矛盾的统一的，而且农业“八字宪法”中的每一条内部也充满了辩证法。
    例如密植。我国过去不少地区流行着一种广种薄收的习惯，在这种习惯中以稀植最为突出，例如水稻株距、行宽都是一尺多，棉花和玉米株距、行宽则更大，严重地浪费了地力，收成很低，因此，需要密植。那么，是不是越密越好呢？当然不是。因为地力毕竟是有一定限度的，而且，太密了不通风，光照也不足，其结果最大的可能不是增产而是减产。施肥也是一样。土地和农作物必须要有足够的肥料才能长得好，增加生产，否则要增产是困难的，因此，必须好好施肥，但也绝不是无限制的施肥。施肥多了或施得不合理，庄稼同样不会长好，同样不能增产，如有的稻田由于施肥过多，使稻子只长禾苗，不结穗，或禾苗被肥料烧坏了。
    所有这一切都说明，对农业“八字宪法”和它的每一条的看法都必须是辩证的全面的。在1958年中，我国农业生产之所以能够出现那种巨大跃进，绝大部分地区增产很多，其根本原因之一，就是我们的党以辩证法的观点领导群众实行了农业“八字宪法”，在工作中防止了片面性。某些地区之所以在这方面失败，也正是由于他们在运用农业“八字宪法”时，不是以辩证法的观点，全面地、互相联系地观察问题和处理问题，而是形而上学的、孤立地对待农业“八字宪法”。例如，他们强调大修水利，就忽视深耕，强调了密植，就密得稻秧不能通风。使工作从一个极端走向另一个极端，结果只有失败。
    贯彻农业“八字宪法”要实事求是，一切以时间、条件、地点为转移
    那么，怎样才能正确运用辩证法指导农业生产呢？例如密植、施肥怎样才算合理？怎样才能合理？测量它们合理与否的标准又是什么？
    实事求是，从实际情况出发，这是马克思主义辩证法的基础，是一切马克思主义者考虑问题的出发点，也是正确贯彻农业“八字宪法”的主要立脚点。既然农业“八字宪法”是一个互相对立的统一体，在工作中就必须对各项措施都给以合理安排，不能顾此失彼。贯彻农业“八字宪法”时，必须充分根据本地的情况：土地、气候、人力、物力来决定具体措施。也就是说，以时间、条件、地点为转移。而不能死搬硬套别人的经验。例如密植，有的地方土质好，气候温暖，人力物力多，那么就可能每亩栽秧五、六万蔸是合适的，叫作合理密植，如果只栽三、四万蔸可能是保守了；而另外一些地区由于条件的不同，条件差些，可能每亩栽秧三、四万蔸是合适的，再多了就是过密，就会造成错误。施肥也是如此，必须根据土壤情况而定。你这里的地质本来含钾多一些，现在多施些磷肥就会是合理的，会增产，他那里由于地质情况不同，也许施磷肥过多了不仅无益反而有害。这一切都说明，我们在贯彻农业“八字宪法”中必须从本地实际情况出发，只有这样，才能真正达到增产的目的，这是唯一正确的马克思主义态度。所谓“合理”，就是正确地把普遍真理与本地的客观实际情况结合起来。脱离了具体情况就没有真理的标准。
    马克思主义辩证法的规律又告诉我们，从整个来说，事物的发展是无限的，但在一定时期，一定条件下来说，又是有限的。这两者有联系，但又必须严格区别开来。因此，密植、施肥、深耕、计划产量的提高等等都只能是相对的，不是绝对的。如果有人想在一亩田里栽五百万蔸秧、下一万斤化学肥料，深耕一丈，亩产一百万斤，那也只会造成浪费，不会有任何其他结果。我们要反对对待农业“八字宪法”的教条主义的形而上学的态度，这种态度的本质是主观主义。这种态度的特点和辩证法完全相反，对问题的看法是孤立的静止的片面的，把问题绝对化。他们不考虑本地实际情况和本身条件，生搬外地经验而自己毫无创造性。那些为了实现这一项措施而丢掉另一项措施，顾了这块土地丢了那块土地，一听说密植能增产，就拼命地密，认为越密越好，一听说肥料多了能增产，就不顾客观条件，无限制地施肥，结果遭到失败的人就属于这一种人。
    当然，应该说明一点，有计划的在某一时候为了集中突击某一项工作，而把其他各项放到次要地位，另一时期又集中力量突击另一项任务，又把其他的放到次要地位，这种分别缓急轻重的工作方法，并不是只顾一点不顾全面。它不但不违反辩证法，而且恰恰符合辩证法的规律，因为任何事物的发展都有它的不同阶段，每一不同阶段都有它的主要矛盾。辩证法告诉人们要正确认识并找出主要矛盾，然后集中力量加以解决，只有这样，才能使事物更好的前进。此外，对于极小面积的大胆的科学试验，也是值得提倡的，这种作法也绝不能说是主观主义。
    我们上面着重谈到了实事求是对辩证法的巨大意义，对正确贯彻农业“八字宪法”的重要性。但是谁要想以“实事求是”、“从实际情况出发”这种科学名词来偷运保守思想，不想进行农业生产上的巨大革命，那也是错误的。事物是不断发展的，一切条件都在不断变化，一个条件的变化，必然会引起其他一系列的变化。我们的任务是，从目前的实际情况出发，想尽一切办法，发挥冲天的革命干劲，推动生产发展，扶持新鲜事物的成长。任何因循守旧、不充分认识人的主观能动性的思想，都是与马克思主义辩证法不相容的，而且早被大跃进的事实驳倒了。我们不仅应每时每刻关心和促进这些变化，同时还应每时每刻根据变化了的形势改变自己的思想、自己的计划和自己的措施。
    走群众路线，是贯彻农业“八字宪法”的根本方法
    实事求是，从实际情况出发去贯彻农业生产“八字宪法”，具体运用辩证法来指导农业生产，这不仅是个思想方法问题，同时也是一个重要的观点立场和工作作风问题。
    大家知道，一切真正的科学理论归根结蒂来源于客观实践，来源于广大群众。马克思主义认定，人民群众是生产者又是历史的创造者。毛泽东同志曾再三指示我们，群众力量是最伟大的，我们必须依靠群众，相信群众，向群众学习，先当群众的小学生，再当群众的先生。关于怎样依靠群众发动群众的问题，毛泽东同志在党的第七次代表大会上的报告中这样指出：“我们的代表大会应该号召全党提起警觉，注意每一个工作环节上的每一个同志，不要让他脱离群众。教育每一个同志热爱人民群众，细心地倾听群众的呼声；每到一地，就和那里的群众打成一片，不是高踞于群众之上，而是深入于群众之中；根据群众的觉悟程度，去启发和提高群众的觉悟，在群众出于内心自愿的原则之下，帮助群众逐步地组织起来，逐步地展开为当时当地内外环境所许可的一切必要的斗争。在一切工作中，命令主义是错误的，因为它超过群众的觉悟程度，违反了群众的自愿原则，害了急性病。”（毛泽东选集第三卷1096页）在这里，毛泽东同志明确地指出了向群众学习，当群众的学生的严重意义和怎样才能当好群众的先生这个极端重要的问题。同时也说明了唯物辩证法本身是和明确的群众观点、坚定的无产阶级立场分不开的。
    农业“八字宪法”是群众创造的，而贯彻执行这个“宪法”的主要力量也是广大群众。只有广大群众才能有力量来实现它，只有广大人民群众才最熟悉农业生产，熟悉本地的气候、土质、人力、物力等一切主客观条件。群众路线的工作方法是我党各种工作的根本方法，在贯彻农业技术革命和指导农业生产中也必须采用群众路线的方法。只有这样才能作到实事求是。因此，每一个干部都应有明确的群众观点，坚定的无产阶级立场，深入群众联系群众的工作作风。每个人都应当深入到群众中去作调查研究，种试验田，和他们打成一片，学习他们的生产经验，细心倾听他们的意见，从他们中间了解本地的各种条件，同时大力发动群众总结他们的生产知识和经验，再结合本地情况把外地经验加以鉴定，无论本地或外地的东西，好的用之，不好的弃之。在贯彻这些措施时，更要作到真正出自群众的
  “内心自愿”，取得大多数群众真正同意。只有这样，广大群众才会真正把技术改革掌握起来。有了广大群众的自觉行动，加上党的正确领导，农业生产大跃进就成为必然的了。而且可以肯定，只要这样作了，不仅会使农业增产，而且会进一步发展和丰富农业“宪法”。
    马克思主义辩证法正在各个领域里发挥着巨大的威力，在农业生产中的作用也越来越大了，可以肯定，随着生产技术的不断提高和复杂，辩证法在这个领域中的重大作用会更加明显。党中央和毛泽东同志一再指示我们学习哲学，就是为了使我们掌握唯物辩证法的规律，更好地工作。在大跃进的时代里，辩证唯物主义空前地发展了丰富了，我们应该更加努力地学习，以加速我们伟大的社会主义建设。
