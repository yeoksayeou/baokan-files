Xuzhou Coal Mine and Construction Company workers, in the large-scale high-yield red banner competition, comprehensively utilized various advanced experiences according to local and temporal conditions. They creatively developed and improved many single experiences into complete sets of experiences, powerfully guaranteeing high yields in various working faces with differing conditions.

During last year's technical innovation movement, Xuzhou miners promoted the revolutionary spirit of daring to think and daring to act, creating many important advanced experiences. Seven of these were listed by the Ministry of Coal as 36 experiences to be promoted nationwide. These advanced experiences played a great role in shortening auxiliary labor time for mining and tunneling, improving mining and tunneling efficiency, accelerating shaft construction, and ensuring Xuzhou's coal industry achieved an unprecedented Great Leap Forward last year. This year, Xuzhou Coal Mine's production tasks have doubled compared to last year. With high targets, heavy tasks, and relatively tight supplies of materials and equipment, workers are determined to seize large-scale high yields. The six coal mining and tunneling areas of the Xiaqiao and Hanqiao coal mines, the hydraulic mining area of the Qingshanquan Coal Mine, and the Quantai area of the Construction Company have successively developed new sets of experiences adapted to local conditions. For example, in coal mining, they absorbed various single experiences from other places and, based on the length of the working face, the quality of the roof, and the strength of technical forces and transportation capacity, comprehensively developed various sets of coal mining methods suitable for their own conditions, such as "long face long cut single cycle," "long face short cut double cycle," "short face long cut double cycle," "short face short cut multiple cycle," and "one shot one knife double cycle."

The biggest characteristic of these complete sets of experiences is that the broad masses of workers closely focus on the key to a greater leap forward in coal production this year and flexibly and comprehensively utilize and develop various single experiences based on specific circumstances, enabling all working faces with different conditions to comprehensively improve production levels. Liu Kaiwen, the Party Branch Secretary of the Fifth Mining Area of Hanqiao Mine, said: "We already have many advanced experiences. The question is how to better and more effectively bring their role into play and comprehensively improve production levels." The North Nineteenth working face, which was being extracted in March, was a trapezoidal working face with a wide bottom and a narrow top, becoming shorter as mining progressed. In order to ensure that production did not decrease, or even increased, despite the shortening of the working face, the workers of the working area, through heated discussions, bravely decided to change the combined double-cycle coal mining method to the combined one-shot one-knife double-cycle coal mining method, which could increase the daily progress by 70%.

The concrete application of complete sets of experiences has made labor organization, on-site management, and production organization more rigorous than in the past. This requires cadres to adopt a more in-depth leadership style. Before adopting new operating methods, the new operating procedures should be tested item by item, while organizing all the workers in the area to repeatedly study and discuss them. Then, mobilize and rely on the collective wisdom and strength of the masses to fight tenaciously and remove obstacles on the road ahead.

    徐州煤矿因地制宜夺取高额丰产
    单项经验变为成套经验
    本报讯　徐州煤矿和建井公司职工在大面积丰产红旗竞赛运动中，因地制宜、因时制宜地综合运用各种先进经验，把许多单项经验创造性地发展提高成为成套的经验，有力地保证各种不同条件的工作面获得高额丰产。
    徐州矿工在去年的技术革新运动中，发扬了敢想敢干的革命精神，曾经创造了许多重要的先进经验，其中为煤炭部列入三十六项经验向全国推广的就有七项。这些先进经验，对缩短采掘辅助劳动时间，提高采掘效率，加快建井速度，保证徐州煤炭工业取得去年空前的大跃进，起了很大的作用。今年，徐州煤矿的生产任务比去年增加了一倍。指标高、任务重、器材设备供应比较紧张。职工们为了坚决夺取大面积高额丰产，夏桥煤矿和韩桥煤矿的六个采煤和掘进工区、青山泉煤矿的水力采煤工区、建井公司的权台工区都先后出现了因地制宜的成套的新经验。例如，在采煤方面，他们吸取了外地的各种单项经验，根据本区工作面的长短、顶板的好坏、技术力量和运输能力的强弱，综合发展成为“长面长截单循环”、“长面短截双循环”、“短面长截双循环”、“短面短截多循环”和“一炮一刀双循环”等多种各自适合自己条件的成套的采煤方法。
    这种成套经验的最大特点，是广大职工紧紧围绕了今年煤炭生产更大跃进的关键，根据具体情况来灵活地综合运用和发展各种单项经验，使各种不同条件的工作面能够全面地提高生产水平。韩桥矿采煤五区党支部书记刘开文说：“我们已经有了很多先进经验，问题是如何更好更有效地发挥它们的作用，使生产水平全面提高。”这个工区3月份回采的北十九工作面，是一个底宽顶狭的梯形工作面，越采工作面就越短。为了保证在工作面缩短的情况下不减少甚至增加产量，工区职工通过热烈讨论，勇敢地决定把康拜因双循环采煤法改为康拜因一炮一刀双循环采煤法，这样可以使日进度增加70％。
    成套经验的具体运用，使劳动组织、现场管理、生产组织比过去更加严密了，这就要求干部的领导作风更加深入。在采用新的操作方法以前，对于新的作业规程，要逐项试验，同时组织全区职工反复学习和讨论。然后动员和依靠群众的集体智慧和力量，顽强战斗，清除前进道路上的障碍。
