    Reinforcing the Battle of Summer Harvesting, Planting, and Summer Field Management
    Large Machines and Small Farm Tools Head South in Teams
    According to Xinhua News Agency, Heilongjiang and Liaoning provinces recently decided to transfer ninety-five grain combine harvesters and thirty-nine large threshing machines to support Henan, Hebei, and Anhui in rushing to harvest wheat. These machines have now all been transported to the wheat-producing areas of these provinces.
    Henan, Hebei, and Anhui provinces are the main wheat-producing areas in our country. The wheat planting area of the three provinces reaches more than 130 million mu. Wheat will be ready for harvest soon, while Heilongjiang and Liaoning do not have summer-ripening grain crops. Under the guidance of the idea of "the whole country as one chessboard," many state-owned farms and people's communes in Heilongjiang and Liaoning provinces have decided to transfer combine harvesters and large threshing machines to provide support.
    Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, May 27th: According to the state plan, the staff of the Tianjin Hardware Production Materials Purchasing and Supply Station is transferring a large number of agricultural machines, new-style farm tools, and small farm tools to support summer harvesting, planting, and summer field management in various places. From January to mid-May this year, the station shipped a total of more than 2,600 tractors and rice threshers to Sichuan, Henan, Jiangsu, and other places, as well as more than 140,000 pieces of irrigation and drainage pumps and small farm tools such as three-toothed weeding hoes and iron shovels.

    增援夏收夏种和夏田管理战斗
    大机器小农具结队南下
    据新华社讯  黑龙江和辽宁两省最近决定抽调九十五台谷物联合收割机和三十九台大型脱粒机，支援河南、河北、安徽抢收小麦，现在这些机器已全部运往这些省的产麦地区。
    河南、河北和安徽等省是我国的主要产麦区。三省的小麦播种面积达一亿三千多万亩，目前即将开镰收割，而黑龙江、辽宁却没有夏熟粮食作物。在全国一盘棋的思想指导下，黑龙江和辽宁两省的许多国营农场和人民公社决定抽调联合收割机和大型脱粒机前往支援。
    据新华社天津27日电  天津五金生产资料采购供应站的职工，根据国家计划，调运大批农业机器、新式农具和小农具，支援各地夏收夏种和进行夏田管理。从今年1月到5月中旬，这个站运往四川、河南、江苏等地的拖拉机、打稻机共两千六百多台，排灌用的水泵以及三齿耘锄、铁锨等小农具十四万多件。
