Comrade Chairman, Fellow Delegates:

I fully agree with the various reports presented at the conference. Now, I would like to talk about the work done in Henan Province in promoting the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet and Mandarin.

Henan Province started promoting Mandarin in the winter of 1955. By the end of 1957, 60,000 language teachers in primary and secondary schools and normal schools had received training in Mandarin pronunciation. Relying on these teachers, Mandarin teaching was carried out in schools, enabling many students to use Mandarin pronunciation to read texts aloud and answer questions in class. Some students could even speak relatively fluent Mandarin in daily life.

After the promulgation of the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet Scheme, driven by the comprehensive Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production in 1958, and with the growing urgent needs of the technical revolution and cultural revolution, the work of implementing the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet and promoting Mandarin in our province has also made rapid progress. According to incomplete statistics, in 1958, about 140,000 of the more than 170,000 teachers in primary and secondary schools and normal schools in the province had studied the phonetic alphabet, and some of them could use Mandarin for teaching; students in primary and secondary schools and normal schools throughout the province are also actively learning the phonetic alphabet, and some students can already use the phonetic alphabet to annotate Chinese characters and spell short articles, and can speak Mandarin.

The achievements of using the phonetic alphabet to assist literacy and promote Mandarin among workers and peasants are also significant. When the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet and the promotion of Mandarin were first introduced to the workers and peasants, some people had some resistance. For example, some people thought that the shapes of the phonetic alphabet were crooked and not as easy to learn as Chinese characters; others said that learning to speak Mandarin was "forgetting one's roots" and "abandoning the Beijing accent." After extensive publicity and repeated explanations of the main uses of the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet and the important political significance of promoting Mandarin, and in some areas after mass discussions, the views on promoting the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet and Mandarin were reversed, and the study of the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet and Mandarin was rapidly carried out in some areas. According to incomplete statistics from eighteen counties and cities such as Jiaozuo and Nanzhao, 3,963 teachers of people's schools were trained in January and February of 1959 alone. After training 745 people's school teachers in Changge County, 306 training classes were held in districts, attracting more than 43,000 people to participate in the study. At present, some areas in our province are gradually developing from point to area based on red and expert schools; some areas have already launched a widespread upsurge in learning the phonetic alphabet among the broad masses of young and middle-aged people in conjunction with political, cultural, and technical studies, and have played a great role in consolidating and expanding literacy achievements. After learning the phonetic alphabet, the members of the Liancun People's Commune in Ye County praised it, saying: "The phonetic alphabet is a magic weapon, learning culture cannot be separated from it, it stands on the head of Chinese characters (annotation), and the name (the pronunciation of the Chinese character) is known without calling it." They also said: "Socialism is heaven, you can't get there without culture, the cultural and technical revolution, the phonetic alphabet scheme is the bridge." Ma Qinghe, a farmer from Taipingdian in Changge County, had attended a people's school for three months in the past and knew seven hundred characters, but had forgotten more than three hundred. However, after learning the phonetic alphabet, he quickly recognized more than seven hundred Chinese characters annotated with the phonetic alphabet. Now he can also read general books and newspapers and write articles of three hundred to five hundred characters. Ma Guijin, a female student at a people's school in Changge County, could spell out one hundred and ten Chinese characters in forty minutes after learning the phonetic alphabet. She happily said: "In the past, I had to run my legs off to recognize characters, but now I only need to use my mouth." A student from a people's school in Dengfeng County used the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet to spell out the words "dai" and "hun" in the couplet “Study culture diligently, learn technology attentively, when I graduate from middle school, I will wear a red flower and get married.” In addition, in Ye County, Dengfeng, Luoyang City, and other places, on the basis of workers, peasants, and young people mastering the phonetic alphabet and using it to assist literacy and improve culture, a movement to learn to speak Mandarin has also been launched.

The above situation shows that, under the leadership of the Party committees at all levels, the work of promoting the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet and Mandarin in our province has achieved certain results. However, promoting the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet and Mandarin is a new task, and the time of implementation is not long, and the development in various places is still uneven. Therefore, we should not be satisfied with these achievements. We must muster greater efforts, and on the basis of the existing work achievements, advance victoriously and strive to make greater achievements, in order to adapt to the greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in 1959. Our specific plans are:

1. Among workers, peasants, and young people, we must closely integrate with production, integrate with the center, integrate with workers' and peasants' spare-time education, and widely launch an upsurge in learning the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet. For illiterate, semi-literate, or students who have already graduated from literacy classes, we must organize them to participate in the study of the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet as much as possible, so that they can master this powerful tool to help recognize Chinese characters, quickly reach the standard of literacy graduation, consolidate and expand the scope of literacy, improve culture, master advanced technology, and better serve industrial and agricultural production. For young people among the workers and peasants, they are also required to read some short annotated reading materials frequently on this basis, practice the four tones of Mandarin pronunciation, gradually correct dialects and learn to speak Mandarin.

2. The requirements for school teachers and students to learn the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet and Mandarin should be strict, in order to gradually improve the quality of speaking Mandarin. Teachers and students who have mastered the phonetic alphabet and learned to speak Mandarin are required to use the phonetic alphabet to annotate Chinese characters and short articles frequently inside and outside the classroom, read short annotated reading materials, and speak Mandarin frequently, striving to gradually reach the standard of being able to skillfully use the phonetic alphabet and being closer to Mandarin pronunciation. Teachers and students who have not yet learned the Chinese Phonetic Alphabet and cannot speak Mandarin should be organized to actively participate in the study, so that they gradually learn the phonetic alphabet, use the phonetic alphabet to annotate Chinese characters and recognize short annotated reading materials, and practice speaking Mandarin. At the same time, this year we plan to select individual large classes in kindergartens to focus on trial teaching of the phonetic alphabet, and gradually promote it after gaining experience.

3. Continue to train teachers and continuously improve the quality of teachers. In 1959, our province plans to: continue to train middle and primary school teachers and kindergarten teachers who have not learned the phonetic alphabet by means of centralized training, or organize them to conduct amateur self-study; for factories, mines, and production teams, we must also train a certain number of people's teachers according to actual needs. At the same time, teachers should be encouraged to practice frequently, correct each other's pronunciation, listen to reading records, listen to the radio, ... to continuously improve the quality of teachers in promoting the phonetic alphabet and Mandarin.

4. Strengthen the leadership of the Party, implement political command, adopt the working method of the mass line, implement the policy of serving politics and serving production, and carry out the work extensively and deeply. The cultural and educational bureaus of various cities and counties must, under the leadership of the Party committees, have special personnel responsible for this work, seriously study and solve problems and difficulties in the work, and should pay attention to frequent supervision and inspection and continuously accumulate experience. All types of schools at all levels must include this work in the school's education plan, with the language group as the core, cooperate with the Communist Youth League, Young Pioneers, and trade unions to effectively carry out the work, and should help workers and peasants learn the phonetic alphabet and Mandarin according to conditions and possibilities. Promote each other and gradually form a social atmosphere.

### 让汉语拼音字母在扫盲和推广普通话方面发挥更大的作用

    让汉语拼音字母在扫盲和推广普通话方面发挥更大的作用
    高镇五代表的发言主席、各位代表：
    我完全同意大会上的各项报告。现在，我想谈谈河南省推行汉语拼音字母和推广普通话的工作情况。
    河南省是在一九五五年冬开始推广普通话工作的。到一九五七年底，受过普通话语音训练的中、小学和师范学校的语文教师有六万人。依靠这些教师在学校中开展了普通话教学，使不少学校的学生都学会使用普通话语音朗读课文和回答课堂提问，有些学生还能在日常生活中说较流利的普通话。
    在汉语拼音方案公布后，在一九五八年工农业生产全面大跃进形势的推动下，随着技术革命和文化革命迫切需要的增长，我省进行汉语拼音字母和推广普通话工作也有较快的进展。据不完全统计：一九五八年，全省中小学和师范学校教师十七万多人中约有十四万人学过拼音字母，其中并有一部分教师能使用普通话进行教学；全省中小学和师范学校的学生也正在积极地学习拼音字母，部分学生已会用拼音字母给汉字注音和拼写短文，会说普通话。
    在工农群众中利用拼音字母帮助扫盲和推广普通话的成绩也很显著。当开始在工农群众中推行汉语拼音字母和推广普通话的时候，有些人曾有一些抵触情绪。如有人认为拼音字母的字形弯弯扭扭，不如汉字好学；有人说学说普通话是“忘本”，是“撇京腔”。经过广泛宣传，反复说明汉语拼音字母的主要用处和推广普通话的重要政治意义，有的地区还经过群众性的鸣放讨论，这样就扭转了对推行汉语拼音字母和推广普通话的看法，并且在部分地区迅速地开展了汉语拼音字母和普通话的学习。据焦作、南召等十八个县、市的不完全统计，仅在一九五九年元、二两个月内，就培训了民校教师三千九百六十三人。长葛县在一次训练民师七百四十五人后，又分区举办训练班三百零六班，吸收四万三千多人参加了学习。目前，我省有的地区正在以红专学校为基地，从点到面逐步开展；有的地区已经在广大青壮年中结合政治、文化和技术的学习，普遍掀起了学习拼音字母的热潮，并且对于巩固扩大扫盲成果起了很大作用。叶县廉村人民公社社员学过拼音字母后赞美说：“拼音字母是法宝，学习文化离不了，汉字头上站一站（注音），名字（即汉字读音）不唤就知道。”又说：“社会主义是天堂，没有文化不能上，文化技术大革命，拼音方案是桥梁。”长葛县太平店农民马清合过去上过三个月的民校，认识七百字，回生三百多字，但学过拼音字母后，他很快就能认识注有拼音字母的七百多个汉字，现在他还能看一般的书报，能写三百到五百字的文章。长葛县一个民校女学员马桂金学过拼音字母后，在四十分钟内能拼出一百一十个汉字，她高兴地说：“过去不会认字跑折腿，现在只需一张嘴。”登封县一个民校学员在她写的“学文化要认真学技术要用心，啥时中学毕了业，戴着红花去结婚”的快板中，戴（dai）、婚（hun）两字不会写，就是用汉语拼音字母来拼写的。此外，叶县、登封、洛河市等地，在工农青壮年掌握拼音字母，利用拼音字母帮助扫盲和提高文化的基础上，还开展了学说普通话的运动。
    上述情况说明：我省在各级党委的领导下，推行汉语拼音字母和推广普通话的工作收得了一定的成绩。但是，推行汉语拼音字母和推广普通话是一项新的工作，推行的时间不长，各地开展的情况还不平衡，因之，我们就不应满足于上述这些成绩。我们要鼓足更大干劲，在已有工作成绩的基础上，乘胜前进，力争做出更大成绩，以适应一九五九年更大更好更全面的跃进。我们的具体打算是：
    1，在工农青壮年中，要紧密结合生产，结合中心，结合工农业余教育，广泛地掀起学习汉语拼音字母的高潮。对于文盲、半文盲或是已经扫盲毕业的学员，要尽可能地组织他们参加汉语拼音字母的学习，以便使他们掌握这一有力工具，帮助认识汉字，迅速达到扫盲毕业标准和巩固扩大识字范围，提高文化，掌握先进技术，更好地为工农业生产服务。对于工农群众中的青年，还要求他们在此基础上，经常阅读一些简短的注音读物，练习普通话语音的四个声调，逐步纠正方言和学说普通话。
    2、对学校师生学习汉语拼音字母和普通话的要求要严格，以逐步提高说普通话的质量。对已经掌握拼音字母并学会说普通话的教师和学生，要求在课内外经常使用拼音字母拼注汉字、短文，阅读简短的注音读物，经常说普通话，争取逐步达到能熟练运用拼音字母和更加接近普通话语音的标准。对尚未学过汉语拼音字母和不会说普通话的教师和学生，要组织他们积极参加学习，使他们逐步学会拼音字母，运用拼音字母拼注汉字和认读简短的注音读物，并练习说普通说。同时，今年计划选择个别幼儿园的大班，重点试教拼音字母，待取得经验后，再逐步推广。
    3、继续培训师资，不断提高师资质量。一九五九年我省计划：对没有学过拼音字母的中、小学教师和幼儿园的教养员，采取集中训练的办法继续加以训练，或组织他们进行业余自学；对厂矿企业和生产队，也要根据实际需要，培养出一定数量的民师。同时，还要鼓励教师，经常练习，相互正音，听朗读唱片，听广播，……以不断提高推行拼音字母和推广普通话的师资质量。
    4、加强党的领导，实行政治挂帅，采取群众路线的工作方法，贯彻为政治、为生产服务的方针，广泛而深入地开展工作。各市、县文教局要在党委领导下，经常有专人负责这项工作，认真研究与解决工作中的问题和困难，并应注意经常督促检查和不断积累经验。各级各类学校都要把这项工作列入学校的教育计划，以语文组为核心，配合团、队、工会有效地开展工作，并应根据条件与可能，帮助工农群众学习拼音字母和普通话。相互促进，逐步形成社会风气。
