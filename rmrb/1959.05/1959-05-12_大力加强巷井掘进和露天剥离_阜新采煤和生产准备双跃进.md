Xinhua News Agency, Fuxin, 11th – Since the beginning of this year, Fuxin Coal Mine has attached great importance to production preparation work during the high-yield coal production campaign, vigorously strengthening tunnel excavation and open-pit stripping, thereby achieving a double leap in coal mining and production preparation. In the first quarter, the entire mine not only overproduced the plan by more than 72,000 tons of raw coal, but also greatly increased the progress of excavation and stripping compared with the same period last year. Excavation increased by 12% compared with the fourth quarter of last year, and stripping increased by 30.6% compared with the same period last year. The strengthening of preparatory work has created favorable conditions for further increasing the production level in the second quarter.

Coal mine production preparation work—tunnel excavation and open-pit stripping—is the precursor to coal mining. Strengthening excavation and stripping work, and preparing sufficient mineable coal volume in a timely manner, is of decisive significance for ensuring coal mine production. If the preparatory work does not keep up, it will be impossible to maintain a consistently high level of coal production. During the Great Leap Forward last year, Fuxin Coal Mine increased coal production by 80% compared to 1957, but excavation and stripping only increased by 70.3% and 36.3% respectively. Because excavation and stripping work did not keep up, the amount of mineable coal was reduced, which brought difficulties to the further increase of coal production. This year, Fuxin Coal Mine plans to produce 21 million tons of coal, an increase of 7.4 million tons over last year's actual production. If the backward situation of production preparation work is not fundamentally reversed, it will be impossible to complete such a huge production task. Therefore, from the beginning of this year, the mine proposed to focus on strengthening production preparation, so as to achieve a double leap in coal mining and preparation work.

In order to ensure that the growth rate of excavation and stripping is greater than the growth rate of coal mining, the coal mine adopted a series of measures to strengthen preparatory work when arranging the plan for the first quarter. The entire mine criticized the erroneous thinking of only focusing on output while neglecting preparatory work, formulated excavation red flag competition evaluation methods, and launched a vigorous red flag competition movement. The bureau, mine, and pit all assigned dedicated personnel to be responsible for excavation work, established and improved the excavation responsibility system at all levels, arranged engineering charts according to production succession, formulated specific measures, and grasped plans, progress, and measures on a shift-by-shift and day-by-day basis. In terms of material supply and labor allocation, priority was also given to meeting the needs of preparatory work. The entire mine also organizationally fixed the excavation force and stripping electric shovels, ensuring a double leap in coal mining and preparation work.

Recently, while inspecting and summarizing the preparatory work in the first quarter and evaluating the winning units in the competition, the Fuxin Mining Bureau proposed that it would continue to focus on preparatory work in the second quarter, realize a greater leap in coal mining and preparatory work, ensure the completion of the production tasks in the first half of the year, and prepare for producing more coal in the third quarter. A large-scale, high-yield, and abundant production red flag competition movement involving all aspects of coal mining, excavation, and stripping is developing further in this mining area.

    大力加强巷井掘进和露天剥离
    阜新采煤和生产准备双跃进
    新华社阜新11日电　阜新煤矿今年以来在煤炭高产运动中重视生产准备工作，大力加强巷井掘进和露天剥离，从而实现了采煤与生产准备双跃进。第一季度全矿不仅比计划增产了七万二千多吨原煤，掘进、剥离进度都比去年同期大大提高。掘进比去年第四季度提高了12％，剥离比去年同期提高了30.6％。由于准备工作的加强，已为第二季度生产水平的进一步提高创造了有利条件。
    煤矿生产准备工作——巷井掘进和露天剥离，是采煤的先行。加强掘进剥离工作，及时准备出足够的可采煤量，对保证煤矿生产有决定性的意义。准备工作跟不上，就不可能使煤炭生产经常保持高产水平。阜新煤矿在去年大跃进中，煤产量比1957年增长了80％，但掘进和剥离只分别增长了70.3％和36.3％。因为掘进和剥离工作没有跟上，减少了可采煤量，给煤产量的进一步增长带来了困难。今年，阜新煤矿计划产煤二千一百万吨，比去年实际产量又增加了七百四十万吨。如果不从根本上扭转生产准备工作的落后局面，就无法完成这样巨大的生产任务。因此，从今年年初起，这个矿就提出要以加强生产准备为中心，作到采煤与准备工作双跃进。
    为了确保掘进、剥离的增长幅度大于采煤的增长幅度，这个煤矿在安排第一季度计划时，采取了一系列的加强准备工作的措施。全矿在批判了只顾产量忽视准备工作的错误思想的基础上制订了掘进红旗竞赛评比办法，发动群众开展了轰轰烈烈的红旗竞赛运动。局、矿、坑都指定专人负责掘进工作，建立和健全了各级掘进责任制，按生产接续排列工程图表，制定具体措施，按班、按日的抓计划、抓进度、抓措施。在器材供应和劳动力的调配方面，也都优先满足准备工作的需要，全矿还从组织上固定了掘进力量和剥离电铲，保证了采煤与准备工作的双跃进。
    最近，阜新矿务局在检查总结第一季度准备工作和评选竞赛优胜单位的同时，提出第二季度要继续大抓准备工作，实现采煤与准备工作的更大跃进，确保上半年生产任务的完成，为第三季度生产更多的煤炭作好准备。一个包括采煤、掘进、剥离等各方面的大面积高额丰产红旗竞赛运动正在这个矿区进一步深入地发展。
