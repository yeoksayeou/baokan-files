    Let's All Study
    Nehru's Speech
    -- People's Daily Editorial Department --

    Our newspaper published yesterday the full text of Indian Prime Minister Nehru's speech on the Tibetan situation delivered on April 27 in the Indian People's Assembly. In this speech, Nehru fully expressed the Indian government's views and attitudes towards the Tibetan rebellion, which deserves close attention and serious study by all Chinese people.

    Prime Minister Nehru stated that he
  “very much hopes to maintain the friendship between India and China”; and condemned the behavior of a very small number of Indians who insulted our leaders. However, he described the current situation in Tibet as a “tragedy”; said that the basis of the Tibetan rebellion was “strong nationalistic sentiment”; said that
  “if it is said that this is entirely the responsibility of certain ‘reactionary elements of the upper strata’ in Tibet, it seems that this statement simplifies a complex situation extraordinarily.” Is the truth about the Tibetan rebellion really as Nehru described it?

    Nehru said, “We have no desire whatsoever to interfere in Tibet.” He described the slanderous remarks and interventionist actions against China's internal affairs made by some political figures and newspapers in India over the past month or more as "not political in substance," but "primarily a compassion based on sentiment and humanitarian reasons." He described the solemn counterattacks by the Chinese people against these interferences and slanders as "disregarding the facts and courtesy, and using the language of the Cold War." Is the fact really as Nehru described it?

    Nehru's speech, together with his other speeches on the Tibetan rebellion, has revealed the Indian government's attitude towards the Tibetan rebellion in its entirety. This is a matter of vital concern to us, the Chinese people, and we cannot but take it seriously.

    We suggest that all factories, mines, enterprises, people's communes, schools, government organs, troops, democratic parties, people's organizations, and all other units throughout the country conscientiously and carefully study and discuss Nehru's speech.

    The editorial department of this newspaper is studying Nehru's speech and will publish a detailed commentary within a few days.

### 请大家来研究  尼赫鲁的讲话

    请大家来研究
    尼赫鲁的讲话
    ——人民日报编辑部——
    本报昨天全文刊载了印度总理尼赫鲁4月27日在印度人民院就西藏局势问题发表的讲话。在这篇讲话里，尼赫鲁充分表达了印度政府对西藏叛乱的观点和态度，值得我们全中国人民加以密切注意和认真研究。
    尼赫鲁总理表示
  “非常希望保持印度和中国之间的友谊”；并且谴责了极少数印度人侮辱我国领袖的行为。但是，他把目前的西藏局势说成是“悲剧”；说西藏叛乱的基础是“强烈的民族主义情绪”；说
  “如果说这完全要由西藏若干‘上层反动分子’负责，看来这种说法是把一种复杂的情况异乎寻常地简单化了”。西藏叛乱的真相是不是像尼赫鲁所说的这样的呢？
    尼赫鲁说，“我们一点也不想干涉西藏”。他把过去一个多月中印度的一些政界人士和报刊发表的对中国内政的诽谤性言论和干涉性行为，说成是“实质上不是政治性的”，“主要是一种基于情感和人道原因的同情”。他把中国人民对这些干涉和诽谤进行的严正的反击，说成是“不顾事实真相和礼节，并且使用了冷战的语言”。事实是不是像尼赫鲁所说的这样的呢？
    尼赫鲁的这次讲话，连同他关于西藏叛乱的其他讲话，已经把印度政府对西藏叛乱的态度和盘托出了。这是我们中国人民的切身问题，我们不能不加以认真看待。
    我们建议：全国所有工厂、矿山、企业、人民公社、学校、机关、部队、民主党派、人民团体以及所有其他单位，都认真地、仔细地研究和讨论尼赫鲁的讲话。
    本报编辑部正在对尼赫鲁的讲话进行研究，几天之内将发表详细的评论。
