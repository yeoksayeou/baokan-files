Sugarcane is known as a "treasure trove," providing people with food, clothing, and supplies.

　　Sugarcane dregs are a huge fiber resource. If all the sugarcane dregs in our country are utilized, it can produce 6 million dan of rayon or more than 500,000 tons of paper. It's truly "one mu of sugarcane equals two mu of cotton."

　　Molasses from sugarcane sugar production is a good raw material for making alcohol. Fully utilizing existing molasses can produce 90,000 tons of alcohol.

　　Sugarcane dregs can be used to make "furfural." Fully utilizing existing sugarcane dregs can produce more than 20,000 tons of furfural.

　　Filter mud is also very useful. Fully utilizing filter mud after sugar production can produce more than 5,000 tons of cane wax. Filter mud, after extracting cane wax, is a very effective farm fertilizer. In addition, sugarcane can also produce other by-products after sugar production, such as: glycerol, citric acid, yeast, acetone, butanol, and other chemical raw materials.

　　Sugarcane leaves are good materials for compost. After proper treatment, one mu of sugarcane leaves can produce about 1,000 jin of high-quality compost.

　　The economic utilization of sugar beets is roughly similar to that of sugarcane. However, sugar beet production is closely related to the development of animal husbandry. Beet pulp and non-sugar-producing stems and leaves are good feed for livestock. Fully utilizing existing beet pulp, stems, and leaves in our country, mixed with other feeds, can feed more than 300,000 dairy cows or more than 1.9 million pigs (sheep).

    糖料作物的经济价值有多大？
    甘蔗被称为“一身是宝”，它可以提供给人们吃的、穿的、用的。
    甘蔗渣是庞大的纤维资源。全部利用我国现有蔗渣，可产人造丝六百万担或造纸五十多万吨，真是“一亩甘蔗二亩棉”。
    甘蔗制糖后的废蜜是制造酒精的好原料。全部利用现有废蜜，可产酒精九万吨。
    蔗渣可以制造“糠醛”。全部利用现有蔗渣，可产糠醛二万多吨。
    滤坭也很有用，全部利用制糖后的滤坭，可产蔗蜡五千多吨。滤坭提蔗腊后，是肥效很大的农家肥料。此外，甘蔗在制糖后还能得到其他的副产品如：甘油、柠檬酸、酵母、丙酮、丁醇等化工原料。
    甘蔗叶是堆肥的良好材料。一亩地的蔗叶，经过适当的处理后，可以制造出千斤左右的优质堆肥。
    甜菜的经济利用，大体和甘蔗相似。但甜菜生产和发展畜牧业的联系很密切。甜菜制糖后的废丝和不能制糖的、茎叶等都是牲畜的好饲料。充分利用我国现有甜菜废丝、茎叶，掺用其他饲料后，可喂乳牛三十多万头，或猪（羊）一百九十多万头。
