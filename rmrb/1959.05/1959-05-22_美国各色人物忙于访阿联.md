Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, May 20th: News circles here point out that recently, various American figures have intensified their activities in the Near East, especially in the United Arab Republic.

	The delegation from the "American Friends of the Middle East," led by its president, former U.S. Ambassador to Lebanon, Mr. Minor, is actively engaged here. Some jokingly call this activity a "peace" offensive, comparing it to the "Marines" who landed in the Near East while the world was watching the Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference.

	The regular visits of Mr. Black, President of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, to Cairo have become commonplace. It is pointed out here that he comes to study political issues rather than financial ones. U.S. Ambassador to the UAR, Mr. Hare, has repeatedly called on UAR officials and recently visited the Syrian region for the same purpose, is a link in this movement. The purpose of this movement is to prove to the UAR public that there seems to be some "shift" in American policy.

	The "American Friends of the Middle East" delegation consists of twenty-nine people from various circles, including industry, law, religion, and journalism. Among them are General Welber, former political advisor to the U.S. Army in Europe, and Mr. Hutchison, former member of the Egyptian-Israeli Mixed Armistice Commission.

	The delegation's plan includes visits to Damascus, Beirut, Jerusalem, Tel Aviv, Istanbul, and Athens. It is worth noting that Baghdad is not included in this plan.

	It is also worth noting that one member of the "American Friends of the Middle East" delegation openly said in response to a question about the relationship between the UAR and the Soviet Union: "We just want to find out about this here."

    美国各色人物忙于访阿联
    新华社21日讯　塔斯社开罗20日讯：这里的新闻界人士指出，最近，美国各方面的人物加紧了在近东，尤其是在阿联的活动。
    由“美国中东之友社”社长、前美国驻黎巴嫩大使米诺尔率领的这个社的代表团正在这里积极活动。有人半开玩笑地把这种活动叫做“和平”攻势，并把它比作“陆战队”，这支“陆战队”是在全世界都注视着日内瓦外长会议的时候在近东登陆的。
    国际复兴开发银行行长布莱克定期访问开罗已经是司空见惯的事了。据这里指出，与其说他是来研究财经问题，倒不如说他是来研究政治问题的。美国驻阿联大使黑尔多次拜会阿联官方人士并在不久前以同一目的访问叙利亚地区，是这个运动的一个环节。这个运动的目的向阿联公众证明，美国的政策似乎有了某种“转变”。
    “美国中东之友社”代表团由实业、司法、宗教、新闻等各界二十九人组成。其中有欧洲美军参谋部前政治顾问韦尔伯将军、埃及以色列混合停战委员会前委员哈奇森等人。
    这个代表团的计划包括访问大马士革、贝鲁特、耶路撒冷、特拉维夫、伊斯坦布尔和雅典。值得注意的是，这个计划中没有包括巴格达。
    还值得注意的是，“美国中东之友社”代表团的一位成员在答复阿联和苏联的关系问题时公开地说：“我们正好希望在这里弄清这个问题”。
