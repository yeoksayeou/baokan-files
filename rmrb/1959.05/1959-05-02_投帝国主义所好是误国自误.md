Chairman, fellow representatives:
We fully agree with Premier Zhou Enlai's "Government Work Report" and the reports by Vice Premiers Li Fuchun, Li Xiannian, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen.

Now, let us share some of our views on the Tibetan rebellion and the interference of foreign reactionaries.

This time, the former Tibetan local government and the upper-class reactionary clique, in order to maintain their dark and brutal reactionary rule of serfdom, went against the will of the Tibetan people, colluded with imperialism and foreign reactionaries, and brazenly launched an armed rebellion, abducting the Dalai Lama and fleeing to India. This heinous crime of betraying the motherland, undermining unity, splitting national solidarity, and selling out the interests of the Tibetan people has been resolutely opposed and angrily condemned by the people of all ethnic groups in China, including the patriotic people of Tibet. The State Council of our country has ordered the dissolution of the former Tibetan local government and instructed the People's Liberation Army to quickly quell the rebellion, thereby paving the way for the gradual implementation of democratic reforms in Tibet and the construction of a prosperous, happy, democratic, and socialist new Tibet. This is entirely an internal affair of our country and absolutely does not allow foreign forces to interfere.

However, after the Tibetan rebel group suffered a shameful defeat, it is surprising and regrettable that in our great neighbor India, some newspapers, and even some politicians, are singing in the same tune with imperialism, shouting and clamoring, openly expressing "sympathy" for the Tibetan rebel group, and viciously attacking the just actions of our government in exercising sovereignty to quell the Tibetan rebellion, slandering our central government for "undermining Tibetan autonomy." Recently, after the abducted Dalai Lama arrived in Tezpur, India, Indian foreign officials openly distributed the so-called "Dalai Lama's statement" among foreign journalists, advocating Tibetan "independence." This statement, as pointed out by a Xinhua News Agency political reporter, reveals "a lack of justification, full of lies, and riddled with loopholes." Who is the ghostwriter of such a clumsy work? Who is the behind-the-scenes director of such a stupid and ridiculous play? It is truly "someone behind the scenes, ready to be called out." One Western news agency said that the statement was "drafted after a long meeting with Indian Foreign Ministry officials," and another said that "the Indian government agrees with the Dalai's statement because it wants to indirectly say something that is difficult to say directly." These speculations, like "wind from an empty cave," are not without cause. After the Xinhua News Agency political reporter refuted this clumsy document, another so-called "Dalai's second statement" will only make things worse and attempt to cover up the truth. In any case, the support and encouragement of some Indian political figures for the Tibetan rebel group, and the dissemination of the so-called "Dalai Lama's statement" imposed on the Dalai's head, are all acts of blatant interference in China's internal affairs. This is something that the Chinese people who have stood up will never tolerate, and it is also something that all Chinese people who cherish Sino-Indian friendship cannot remain silent about.

First of all, it must be pointed out that Tibet is an inseparable part of China's sacred territory, the Tibetan ethnic group is a member of the big family of more than fifty ethnic groups in China, and the sovereignty of Tibet belongs to China. This has also been confirmed by the 1954 Sino-Indian Agreement. Non-interference in internal affairs is an important principle among the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence initiated by China and India. The guarantee of "no intention to interfere in China's internal affairs" has also appeared repeatedly in Prime Minister Nehru's statements and is welcomed by the Chinese people. But now, Indian expansionists not only deny that Tibetans are Chinese, but also openly carry out clamorous calls and activities for "Tibetan independence" and against our country in India, and even receive support. If this situation continues, it will be difficult to believe that the Sino-Indian Agreement and the Five Principles are still binding in India.

Secondly, as Premier Zhou's report solemnly pointed out, and as convincingly demonstrated by the speeches of Tibetan local leaders such as Panchen and Ngapoi, the Tibetan rebel group is only a small handful of serf owners who act like tyrants and bandits. Their crazy launch of an armed rebellion and their reliance on imperialism and foreign reactionaries are aimed at burying the good wishes of the vast majority of Tibetan people who demand democratic reforms and the realization of social progress, and at forever maintaining a serf system that is even more barbaric and cruel than the European Middle Ages, plunging more than 1.1 million Tibetan people into a hopeless situation. The so-called "sympathy" of those in India who claim to be "well-intentioned" is precisely focused on a small handful of serf owners who turn Tibet into a living hell, while they turn a blind eye to the legitimate demands of the vast majority of Tibetan people who want to gradually build Tibet into a paradise on earth with the help of the Chinese people of all ethnic groups. Isn't such "sympathy" despicable and shameful?

Thirdly, the slander that our central government "undermines Tibetan autonomy" comes from the mouths of some Indian politicians and is also a malicious slander and a futile effort. Countless facts prove that our central government has not only faithfully implemented the Seventeen-Article Agreement on the Peaceful Liberation of Tibet and done many good things for the Tibetan people, but also patiently waited for and treated the Tibetan upper-class reactionary group with leniency and kindness. If it were not for the Tibetan local government's obstruction in every possible way, ethnic regional autonomy like that implemented in Inner Mongolia and Xinjiang would have been achieved in Tibet long ago. It was the Tibetan upper-class reactionary group that hijacked the Dalai Lama, launched an armed rebellion, and took the initiative to attack the People's Liberation Army troops stationed in Lhasa that tore up the Seventeen-Article Agreement and undermined Tibetan autonomy. The facts are there, and the accusations of Tibetan representatives such as Panchen and Ngapoi are conclusive. Can this still be used to defend the Tibetan rebels?

People know that in the past, in order to invade Tibet, British imperialism raised the banner of "Tibetan independence." After India's independence, some Indian expansionists forgot the disasters suffered by the Indian people under the iron heels of British colonialists for hundreds of years, and shamelessly regarded themselves as "inheritors" of British imperialist privileges in Tibet. After the failure of the Tibetan rebel group, the clamor of the Indian side supporting the rebels and interfering in China's internal affairs undoubtedly reflects the ambitions of these Indian expansionists. We Chinese people feel indignation at such blatant foreign interference, which is completely justified, but at first, we still valued Sino-Indian friendship and restrained ourselves, only offering gentle persuasion. However, the Indian expansionists mistakenly regarded our prudent attitude as a sign of weakness, became complacent, and intensified their efforts, allowing such an ugly farce as the so-called "Dalai Lama's statement" to be staged in Tezpur, and the black flag of so-called "Tibetan independence" to be raised in India, vainly attempting to fish in troubled waters and put "pressure" on our country to undermine our friendly relations with Asian and African nationalist countries. This is indeed going too far. This blatant act of interfering in our internal affairs seriously violates the spirit of the 1954 Sino-Indian Agreement and the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence jointly initiated by China and India; it undermines the common front against imperialism and the traditional friendship between the people of China and India. Whether it is for the benefit of China and India, the common cause of Asian and world people against aggression and safeguarding peace, we Chinese people cannot ignore it. We want to sincerely advise some Indian politicians: The Chinese people of all ethnic groups under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party have stood up strongly, and our 650 million people are united more firmly than steel, and we have enough strength to defend the territorial integrity and sovereignty of our great motherland. Any foreign force's conspiracy to sever our territory and interfere in our internal affairs by taking advantage of the Tibetan rebellion is a daydream and a waste of effort. Moreover, as far as the handling of the Tibetan rebellion is concerned, justice and reason are entirely on our side, and not on the side of the Tibetan rebel group. The Indian expansionists' echoing of imperialism and their attacks and slanders against our country, no matter how vicious, will not in the slightest damage our country's international prestige. As friends of the Indian people, we cannot but solemnly remind some Indian politicians not to misremember the times and misjudge the situation. If they allow the Indian expansionists' blatant interference in our internal affairs and pandering to the tastes of imperialism to continue, it will not only ruin the international reputation that India has earned in advocating peaceful coexistence in recent years, but will also lead India away from the correct path of Sino-Indian friendship and peaceful neutrality, away from reliable international friends who can support each other, and will only be detrimental to the Indian people's cause of maintaining national independence and striving for economic independence, and beneficial to imperialism. Is the tragic consequence of "lifting a stone to smash one's own foot" not enough to be thought-provoking?

Of course, the broad masses of the Indian people stand on a completely different position from the Indian expansionists. They resolutely oppose interference in China's internal affairs and advocate maintaining and developing the friendly relations between China and India. This friendly and righteous attitude has been expressed by the recent statement of the India-China Friendship Association. We Chinese people understand the difference between the broad masses of the Indian people and a small number of Indian expansionists. However, it cannot be denied that in the midst of the clamor of "sympathizing" with the Tibetan rebels and interfering in China's internal affairs, some Indian politicians have become hot-headed and have begun to embark on the path of "hurting those who are close and gladdening the enemy." Moreover, the Dalai Lama has confirmed to Prime Minister Nehru that the several letters he gave to General Tan Guansan are completely true, which completely undermines the main excuses for India's various attacks on China since the Tibetan rebellion occurred. The foothold is like an avalanche, and it is even more necessary to rein in on the cliff, otherwise, it will inevitably end in disgrace. Because what is in my heart is dangerous, I cannot help but once again solemnly warn these "smart politicians" in India: If you still believe that the Sino-Indian Agreement is worth keeping, the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence are worth maintaining, the common front against imperialism is worth preserving, and the deep friendship between China and India is worth cherishing, then you must be more sober and return from the path of interfering in China's internal affairs and pandering to the tastes of imperialism, which harms the country and oneself, to the correct path of adhering to the Five Principles and consolidating the friendly relations between China and India!

### 投帝国主义所好是误国自误

    投帝国主义所好是误国自误
    许崇清　刘思慕　朱光　林克明　雷洁琼
    梁广　卢焕章代表的联合发言主席、各位代表：
    我们完全同意周恩来总理所作的“政府工作报告”和李富春副总理、李先念副总理和彭真副委员长的报告。
    现在，让我们就西藏叛乱事件和外国反动派的干涉谈谈我们的一些看法。
    这次原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团为了维持他们的黑暗、残暴的农奴主反动统治，竟违背西藏人民的意志，不惜勾结帝国主义、外国反动派，悍然发动武装叛乱，并劫持达赖喇嘛逃往印度。这种背叛祖国、破坏统一、分裂民族团结，出卖西藏人民利益的滔天罪行、已受到了包括西藏爱国人民在内的中国各族人民所坚决反对和愤怒声讨。我国务院下令解散原西藏地方政府，责成人民解放军迅速平息叛乱，从而为西藏逐步实行民主改革，建设繁荣幸福的、民主的、社会主义新西藏铺平道路，这完全是我国的内政问题，绝对不容许外国势力干涉。
    但是，西藏叛乱集团遭到可耻的失败之后，使人感到惊异和遗憾的是：在我们伟大的邻邦印度，竟也有一些报刊、以至一些政治家和帝国主义一鼻孔出气，大喊大嚷，公然表示“同情”西藏叛乱集团，而对我国政府行使主权平息西藏叛乱的正义行为加以恶毒的攻击，污蔑我中央政府“破坏西藏自治”。最近，被劫持的达赖喇嘛到达印度的提斯浦尔之后，印度外交官员更公然在各国新闻记者中间散发了所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”，鼓吹西藏“独立”。这个声明，正如新华社政治记者所指出，显出“理屈词穷、谎话连篇，破绽百出”。这样拙劣的作品，谁是它的捉刀人？这样愚蠢可笑的把戏，谁是它的幕后导演？真是“此中有人，呼之欲出”。西方通讯社一则说这个声明是同印度外交部官员“长时间会谈以后拟订的”，再则说“印度政府赞同达赖的声明，是想间接地说出一些难于直接说的东西”，这些推测，正如“空穴来风”，不是没有因由的。经过新华社政治记者把这拙劣的文件驳斥之后，再来一个所谓“达赖的第二次声明”，只会愈描愈黑，欲盖弥彰。不管怎样，印度某些政治人物对于西藏叛乱集团的支持和鼓励，强加于达赖头上的所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”的散发，都是粗暴地干涉中国内政的行为，这是已经站立起来的中国人民所绝不能容忍的，这也是所有珍视中印友谊的中国人民所不能默尔而息的。
    首先，必须指出，西藏是中国神圣领土不可分割的一部分，西藏民族是中国五十多个民族大家庭的一员，西藏的主权是属于中国，这也已为一九五四年中印协定所确认；互不干涉内政是中印两国所首倡的和平共处五项原则中的一个重要原则，“无意干预中国内政”的保证也一再见于尼赫鲁总理的声明，而为中国人民所欢迎。而现在，印度扩张主义分子不但否认西藏人是中国人，而且大肆鼓吹“西藏独立”、反对我国的叫嚣和活动也在印度境内公开进行，甚至受到支持。这种情况如果继续下去，就很难使人相信中印协定和五项原则在印度还有约束力。
    其次，正如周总理的报告严正地指出，以及班禅、阿沛等西藏地方领导人的发言令人信服地证明，西藏叛乱集团只是一小撮的行同暴君和匪徒的农奴主，他们疯狂地发动武装叛乱，投靠帝国主义和外国反动派的目的是要葬送绝大多数的西藏人民要求民主改革、实现社会进步的良好愿望，而永远保持比欧洲中世纪更加野蛮、更加残酷的农奴制度，陷一百一十多万西藏人民于万劫不复的境地。而印度自命“好心”的人的所谓“同情”却偏偏倾注于把西藏变成人间地狱的一小撮农奴主，而对于西藏绝大多数人民要在中国各族人民的帮助下把西藏逐步建成人间乐园的正当要求却熟视无睹，这样的“同情”难道还不是可鄙可耻的吗？
    再次，污蔑我国中央政府“破坏西藏自治”出自印度某些政治家之口，也是含血喷人，心劳日拙。无数事实证明，我中央政府不但忠诚地执行了和平解放西藏办法十七条协议，并为西藏人民做了许许多多的好事，而且对于西藏上层反动集团也耐心等待，宽大为怀，做到仁至义尽。如果不是原西藏地方政府百般阻挠的话，像实施于内蒙古和新疆那样的民族区域自治早已会在西藏实现了。撕毁十七条协议，破坏西藏自治的正是劫持达赖喇嘛、发动武装叛乱，先下手进犯我人民解放军驻拉萨部队的西藏上层反动集团。事实具在，班禅、阿沛等西藏代表的指证，言之凿凿，这难道还可以替西藏叛乱分子辩驳的吗？
    人们知道，过去英帝国主义为了侵占西藏，曾经打起了“西藏独立”的旗号，而在印度独立以后，印度的一些扩张主义分子竟忘记了印度人民几百年来在英国殖民主义者铁蹄下所受的灾难，反恬然以英国在西藏的帝国主义特权的“继承者”自居。在西藏叛乱集团失败以后，印度方面支持叛乱分子、干涉中国内政的一片叫嚷，无疑是反映了这些印度扩张主义分子的野心。对于这样的粗暴的外国干涉，我们中国人民感到愤慨，是完全正当的，但我们初时还是以中印友谊为重，力自克制，只婉言规劝。而印度的扩张主义分子竟把我们这种持重的态度错认为软弱的表现，得意忘形，变本加厉，让所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”那样丑恶的把戏在提斯浦尔演出，所谓“西藏独立”那样的黑旗在印度境内打出来，妄图浑水摸鱼，捞它一把，并向我国施加“压力”，以破坏我国与亚非各民族主义国家之间的友好关系。这就做得的确太过份了。这种明目张胆地干涉我国内政的行动，严重地违背了一九五四年中印协定的精神，也违背了中印两国共同首倡的和平共处五项原则；破坏了反对帝国主义共同斗争的阵线，也破坏了中印两国人民之间的传统的友谊。无论是为了中印两国的利益、亚洲和世界人民反对侵略、维护和平的共同事业的利益，我们中国人民都不能置之不理。我们要向印度的某些政治家们率直地忠告：在中国共产党领导下的中国各族人民已经坚强地站立起来了，我们六亿五千万人民团结得比钢铁还坚固，有足够的力量来保卫伟大祖国的领土和主权的完整。任何外国势力假借西藏叛乱事件，割裂我国领土、干涉我国内政的阴谋，都是白日作梦，枉费心机。而且，以西藏叛乱的事件的处理而论，正义和道理完全在我们这一边，而不在西藏叛乱集团那一边，印度扩张主义分子附和帝国主义，对我国进行攻击和污蔑，不管怎样恶毒，也丝毫无损于我国的国际威望。作为印度人民的朋友，我们更不能不严肃地提醒印度的某些政治家们，不要记错时代，不要看错形势，如果听任印度扩张主义分子这种露骨的干涉我国内政、投合帝国主义所好的行动继续下去，那就不仅会败坏印度这些年来倡导和平共处所赢得的国际声誉，而且会使印度离开中印友好、离开和平中立的正确道路，离开可以互相支持的可靠的国际朋友，徒然不利于印度人民维护民族独立和争取经济独立的事业，而有利于帝国主义。“搬起石头砸自己的脚”，这样可悲的后果难道还不够发人深省吗？
    固然，印度的广大人民群众是站在和印度扩张主义分子截然不同的立场的，他们坚决反对干涉中国内政，力主维护和发展中印两国友好关系，这种友好的、严正的态度由最近印中友好协会的声明表达了出来。我们中国人民是懂得把印度广大人民和少数的印度扩张主义分子区别开来的。但是，不容否认，在“同情”西藏叛乱分子、干涉中国内政的一片叫嚣声中，印度的某些政治家已经头脑发热，已经开始踏上“亲者所痛、仇者所快”的道路。何况达赖喇嘛已向尼赫鲁总理证实他给谭冠三将军的几封信是一点不假，这就使得自从西藏叛乱发生以来印度方面对中国种种攻击的主要借口完全破产。立足点势同雪崩，悬崖更须勒马，不然的话，就难免落得一个身败名裂的下场。心所谓危，就不能不在这里再一次正告印度这些“聪明的政治家”：如果你们还认为中印协定值得信守，和平共处的五项原则值得维护，反对帝国主义的共同阵线值得保持，中印两国之间的深厚友谊值得珍惜，你们就得放清醒一些，从干涉中国内政、投合帝国主义所好的误国自误的道路，回到恪守五项原则、巩固中印友好关系的正确道路上来！
