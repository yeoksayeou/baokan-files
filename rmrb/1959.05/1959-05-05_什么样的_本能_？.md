What Kind of "Instinct"?
　　Wang Kang
　　On April 27, Prime Minister Nehru said in the Indian People's Assembly that when the news of the suppression of the Tibetan rebellion "reached India, it immediately aroused a strong and universal reaction." He called this reaction an "instinctive reaction" and "summarized" this reaction as "the reaction of the Indian people." If it is said that the so-called "strong reaction" is a handful of people resonating with the shameful failure of another handful of people, thus "instinctively" generating a frenzied reaction, then this is correctly stated; but to call this reaction summarily "the reaction of the Indian people" not only greatly distorts the truth, but is also an insult to the Indian people.
　　The Chinese People's Liberation Army troops stationed in Tibet quickly crushed the rebellion in Lhasa, and then, after dispatching troops for ten days and sweeping thousands of miles, cleared the rebel bandit nests in the Shannan area. The suppression of this rebellion brought a new life to the Tibetan people. People with a little foresight in the world will rejoice for the vast Tibetan people who have been freed from the barbaric shackles of the serf system. However, it caused a "shock" among a small group of political careerists in India. This is not surprising, as the traitorous gang they inherited from British imperialism had some members purged and some fled to India. In this situation, how could they not "feel very sad" and very "grieved"? Birds of a feather flock together; this can indeed be called an "instinctive reaction" between devils and devils. Their "reaction" is not limited to being "sad" and "grieved"; they even take the Chinese people's self-restraint as weakness and scream and shout frantically and arrogantly. In order to achieve some ulterior motives, they dared to threaten the Chinese people, first openly demanding so-called "Tibetan independence," and then proposing that India convene a so-called "round table conference of India, China, and Tibet" to "resolve" the Tibetan issue. They even published cartoons in newspapers insulting the leaders of the Chinese people and organized demonstrations insulting the leaders of the Chinese people. Mrs. Indira Gandhi, the president of the Indian National Congress and Nehru's daughter, even more incredibly and sensationally fabricated a fairy tale of "if China launches a war against India..." slandering and intimidating, using every possible means. Only when the Chinese people could no longer tolerate it did they give this small group a slight rebuff, telling them to wake up a bit. The Chinese people value Sino-Indian friendship, and doing so is precisely to eliminate the poison spread by reactionaries on Sino-Indian friendship, which is completely justified. Moreover, it is also a matter of reciprocity, so why not! Mr. Nehru actually imposed the evil deeds of this small group on the Indian people, calling it "the reaction of the Indian people," which is extremely unfair to the Indian people. Like the Chinese people, the broad masses of the Indian people highly cherish the peaceful friendship and the Five Principles jointly forged by the people of the two countries. This friendship can never be destroyed by a small group of reactionaries. The clear attitude shown by the broad masses of Indian working people and fair public opinion on the Tibet issue is an excellent proof. This is the instinct of the people. Who is actively using "the language of the Cold War," "disregarding the facts and etiquette," and doing everything possible to damage Sino-Indian friendly relations, the Chinese people must clarify the issue.

### 什么样的“本能”？

    什么样的“本能”？
    王康
    尼赫鲁总理4月27日在印度人民院说：当西藏叛乱业已平定的消息“传到印度来的时候，立刻引起了强烈的普遍的反应”。他把这种反应称作是一种“本能的反应”，并且把这种反应“概括”为“印度人民的反应”。如果说，所谓“强烈的反应”是一小撮人对另一小撮人的可耻失败发生共鸣，因而“本能地”发生一种疯狂的反应，这是说对了的；但把这种反应笼统地叫作是“印度人民的反应”，这就不仅大大地歪曲了真理，而且也是对印度人民的一种侮辱。
    中国人民解放军驻西藏部队迅速粉碎了拉萨的叛乱，接着出师十日，挥戈千里，清扫了山南地区的叛匪巢穴。这次叛乱的平定，给西藏人民带来了新生。世界上稍有远见的人士，都会为广大西藏人民从此摆脱了农奴制度的野蛮桎梏而庆幸。然而它却引起了印度一小撮政治野心家的“震动”。这也难怪，他们从英帝国主义手里继承下来的那个卖国贼班子，有的被肃清了，有的逃窜到印度去了。在这种情况下，他们又怎能不“感到非常难过”和非常“哀伤”呢？惺惺惜惺惺，这的确称得起是一种魔鬼同魔鬼间的“本能的反应”。他们“反应”起来岂只限于“难过”、“哀伤”而已，简直还以中国人民的善自克制为可欺，拼命大喊大叫，飞扬跋扈。他们为了达到某种不可告人的目的，竟敢威胁中国人民，始则公然要求所谓“西藏独立”，继则提出由印度召集所谓“印度、中国、西藏三方面的圆桌会议”来“解决”西藏问题。他们甚至在报刊上发表侮辱中国人民领袖的漫画，组织侮辱中国人民领袖的示威。印度国大党主席、尼赫鲁的女儿英迪拉·甘地夫人更加神乎其神，耸人听闻地制造什么“如果中国对印度发动战争……”的童话，诬蔑恫吓，无所不用其极。中国人民在忍无可忍之际，才对这一小撮人稍作回击，叫他们清醒一点。中国人民以中印友谊为重，这样做正是为了消除反动分子在中印友谊上散布的毒素，是完全正当的。而且也是一种礼尚往来，谁曰不宜！尼赫鲁先生竟把这一小撮人的恶行劣迹硬加到印度人民头上，称之为“印度人民的反应”，这对印度人民是极不公正的。广大印度人民同中国人民一样，是非常珍视中印两国人民共同缔造的和平友谊与五项原则的。这种友谊决非一小撮反动分子所能破坏得了。印度广大劳动人民和公正的舆论界在西藏问题上所表示的清醒态度，便是一个极好的证明。这才是人民的本能。谁在积极地使用“冷战的语言”、“不顾事实真象和礼节”，不顾一切地干着损害中印友好关系的勾当，中国人民是非要把问题弄清楚不可的。
