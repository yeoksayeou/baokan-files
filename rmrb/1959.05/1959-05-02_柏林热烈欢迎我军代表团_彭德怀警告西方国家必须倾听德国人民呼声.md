Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, May 1st: The Ministry of National Defense of the German Democratic Republic held a mass rally near Berlin on the evening of the 30th to welcome the Chinese military friendship delegation headed by Marshal Peng Dehuai.

Attending the rally were Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of National Defense of the German Democratic Republic, General Stoph, First Deputy Minister of National Defense and Chief of General Staff, Lieutenant General Hoffmann, Director of the Political Department, Major General Delling, representatives of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, and thousands of local residents.

Lieutenant General Hoffmann delivered a welcoming speech at the meeting. After praising China's achievements in socialist construction, he said that with only a few days left until the Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference, Germany and all peace-loving people around the world are eagerly hoping that the conference will help further ease international tensions.

Marshal Peng Dehuai then spoke, saying that under the pressure of just world public opinion, Western countries have recently made a gesture of willingness to negotiate in order to extricate themselves from their very embarrassing situation. From the viewpoint that world peace is indivisible, the People's Republic of China hopes that the upcoming Foreign Ministers' Conference will pave the way for a summit meeting, and that a peace treaty with Germany will be concluded and the peaceful reunification of Germany will be realized as soon as possible. He said that there are indications that some Western countries are still trying to delay and obstruct the signing of a peace treaty with Germany, thereby permanently dividing Germany and maintaining the occupation regime in West Berlin.

Marshal Peng Dehuai emphasized that we want to warn those gentlemen who adhere to the policy of war and aggression: the era in which you could do whatever you wanted is gone forever. If you disregard the German people's desire for peaceful reunification of their motherland, are unwilling to solve the German problem by peaceful means, and even attempt to resort to force to infringe upon the territory and sovereignty of the German Democratic Republic; then, the more than 600 million Chinese people will, together with the powerful Soviet Union and other socialist countries, fully support the German Democratic Republic and thoroughly smash the provocations of imperialist aggression. We are deeply convinced that with the strong support of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union and the peace-loving people of the world, the German people will surely be able to build a unified, peaceful, and democratic Germany. He said, we know clearly that the imperialists will not automatically withdraw from the stage of history, and they are always trying to reverse the wheels of historical development. They are still pursuing the already bankrupt policies of aggression and war.

    柏林热烈欢迎我军代表团
    彭德怀警告西方国家必须倾听德国人民呼声
    新华社柏林1日电　德意志民主共和国国防部30日晚在柏林附近举行群众大会，欢迎以彭德怀元帅为首的中国军事友好代表团。
    参加大会的有德意志民主共和国副总理兼国防部长斯多夫上将、国防部第一副部长兼总参谋长霍夫曼中将、政治部主任德林少将和陆、海、空军代表以及当地居民代表数千人。
    霍夫曼中将在会上致欢迎词。他在称赞中国社会主义建设的成就以后说，现在距离日内瓦外长会议只有几天的工夫了，德国和全世界一切关心保卫和平的人都以急切的心情希望会议有助于进一步缓和国际紧张局势。
    彭德怀元帅接着讲话，他说，西方国家在世界公正舆论的压力下，为了摆脱他们十分狼狈的处境，最近作出了愿意谈判的姿态。中华人民共和国从世界和平不可分割的观点出发，希望即将召开的外长会议能为最高级会议铺平道路，希望早日缔结对德和约，实现德国的和平统一。他说，但是有迹象表明，某些西方国家仍然企图拖延和阻挠对德和约的签订，从而永久分裂德国和维持西柏林占领制度。
    彭德怀元帅强调说，我们要警告那些坚持战争政策和侵略政策的先生们：你们为所欲为的时代已经一去不复返了。如果你们不顾德国人民和平统一祖国的意愿，不愿用和平的方法解决德国问题，甚至企图诉诸武力，侵犯德意志民主共和国的领土和主权；那么，六亿多中国人民将同强大的苏联和其他社会主义国家一起，全力支持德意志民主共和国，彻底粉碎帝国主义的侵略的挑衅。我们深信：在以苏联为首的社会主义阵营和全世界爱好和平人民的坚强支持下，德国人民一定能够建立起一个统一的、和平的和民主的德国。他说，我们清楚地知道：帝国主义者是不会自动退出历史舞台的，它们总是妄想倒转历史发展的车轮。它们仍在实行已经破产了的侵略政策和战争政策。
