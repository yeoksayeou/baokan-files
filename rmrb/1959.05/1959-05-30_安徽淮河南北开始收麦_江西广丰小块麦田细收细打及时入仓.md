Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 29th. Wheat in Anhui Province, both north and south of the Huai River, has entered the harvest season. Dozens of harvesters, having come from as far away as the Northeast to support the wheat harvest, hummed and rattled as they set out from Bengbu for the wheat harvesting front lines; the people's communes, fully staffed, have already begun reaping in the early-ripening wheat fields. The Feiyue Commune in Huaiyuan County harvested over sixty mu of "March Yellow" early wheat, with an average yield increase of 50% compared to last year. The Dongfanghong Commune harvested thirty mu, with a yield increase of 90% compared to last year.

To ensure that every grain returns home, all areas have strictly demanded careful harvesting and threshing from the very beginning of the harvest. Many communes have formulated specific measures for careful harvesting and threshing, ensuring that the harvesting, threshing, sunning, and storage are done simultaneously, and that nothing is left behind in the fields or lost in transport or threshing. The Dianbu Commune in Feidong County conscientiously implemented the "four fixings" responsibility system – fixing the field area, fixing the time, fixing the quality, and fixing the work point rewards – during the wheat harvest, promoting careful harvesting and threshing. The Zheng Gang production team achieved light cutting and placing, clean threshing grounds, heavy threshing and frequent turning, ensuring thorough harvesting and threshing. The Central Production Brigade was somewhat rough at the start of the wheat harvest, but after inspection, mobilized the commune members to re-thresh, resulting in over three more jin of wheat per mu. The commune members did the math: If the entire brigade's three thousand-plus mu of wheat were harvested and threshed carelessly, it would result in a loss of over nine thousand jin. Everyone resolved to no longer be careless during harvesting and threshing. Now, the over two thousand eight hundred mu of wheat that the commune has already harvested and threshed has, after inspection and acceptance, generally met the requirements of clean cutting, clean transporting, clean threshing, and clean gathering.

The area north and south of the Huai River is one of China's major wheat-producing regions, and the wheat carefully cultivated by the people's commune members this year is growing very well. Commune members describe this year's wheat as: "A sight that is never tiresome, a scythe that is hard to cut through, wheat stalks taller than a person, and ears as big as oil bottles."

Low-lying areas along the Huai River and the plains of northern Anhui will enter the peak of the wheat harvest within days, and the wheat harvesting work in these areas has been implemented at all levels and is better prepared than in previous years. Fuyang and Bengbu prefectures have prepared over six million pieces of wheat harvesting tools and over one hundred combine harvesters according to actual needs. Most areas have established wheat harvesting headquarters, erected command posts in the fields, and set up telephone lines to ensure that every area has dedicated personnel responsible for command and inspection. Cadres, troops, schools, and urban residents have also prepared tools, and over one million people will go to the countryside to help farmers rush to harvest wheat.

People's Daily, Nanchang, 29th. Guangfeng County in Jiangxi Province attaches importance to the harvesting and threshing of wheat planted on small areas, ensuring a bumper harvest.

Guangfeng County has a small wheat area and a small total output. Some people believe that wheat is not a major crop and will not affect the total grain output for the year. In addition, other farm work is currently too busy, so it is difficult to achieve careful harvesting and threshing. In response to the above ideas, before the wheat harvest, the Guangfeng County Party Committee promptly conducted a round of propaganda and education on achieving both bumper production and bumper harvest for cadres and the masses, making everyone realize that although rice field management is currently busy, as long as labor and time are properly arranged, careful wheat harvesting and threshing can be achieved. At the same time, during the rush to harvest wheat, the county party committee and each commune designated a secretary to specifically focus on the wheat harvest work, and transferred a group of cadres to work in the teams and be responsible for the groups. To prevent loopholes in harvesting and threshing, each commune also organized dedicated personnel to inspect in batches and strengthened storage work.

Because all areas have conscientiously implemented the above measures, all the wheat in Guangfeng County was quickly harvested within a few days, truly achieving fast and good results, with every grain safely stored.

    安徽淮河南北开始收麦
    江西广丰小块麦田细收细打及时入仓
    新华社合肥29日电　安徽省淮河南北的小麦已经进入收割期。远从东北等地赶来支援收麦的几十部收割机，机声??，从蚌埠开赴麦收前线；人民公社人马齐备，已在早熟的小麦地里开镰。怀远县飞跃公社，收打了六十多亩“三月黄”早小麦，平均亩产比去年增产五成。东方红公社收打三十亩，产量比去年提高90％。
    为了保证颗粒还家，各地刚一开始收割，就严格要求细收细打。很多公社都订出了细收细打的具体办法，做到边收、边打、边晒、边进仓和收净、运净、打净、扫净，颗粒还家。肥东县店埠公社在麦收中认真实行了定田亩、定时间、定质量和定工分报酬的“四定”责任制，推动了细收细打。郑岗生产队做到了轻割轻放，场大地光，重打勤翻，保证了收光打净。中心生产大队开始收麦时，还有些粗糙，经过检查，发动社员进行了复打，每亩多打了三斤多麦。社员们算了一笔账：全大队三千多亩麦子，如果收打粗糙，就要少收九千多斤。大家决心在收打时不再粗心大意。现在，这个公社已收打的二千八百多亩麦子，经过检查验收，一般都达到了割净、运净、打净、收净的要求。
    淮河南北是我国的主要小麦产区之一，今年人民公社社员精心培植的小麦，都长得很好。社员们形容今年的小麦是：“一眼看不够，一镰难割透，麦棵过人头，穗头赛油瓶。”
    沿淮洼地和淮北平原，日内将进入小麦收割高潮，这些地区的麦收工作层层落实，比往年准备得更好。阜阳、蚌埠两个专区根据实际需要，准备了六百多万件麦收工具和一百多台联合收割机。各地大都成立了麦收指挥部，在麦田里搭起了指挥棚，架起了电话线，作到片片有专人负责指挥和检查。机关干部、部队、学校和城镇居民也已准备好工具，将有一百多万人下乡帮助农民抢收小麦。
    本报南昌29日电　江西省广丰县重视种植在小面积上的小麦收打工作，保证了丰产丰收。
    广丰县小麦面积小，总产量不多，部分人认为小麦不是主要作物，影响不了全年粮食总产量，加上当前其他农活太忙，因此很难做到细收细打。针对上述思想，广丰县委在小麦收割前，及时地向干部，群众进行了一次丰产要丰收的宣传教育，使大家认识到当前稻田管理虽然繁忙，但是只要把劳力、时间安排得当，小麦细收细打是可以办到的。同时在突击抢收小麦期间，县委和各公社都指定了一个书记专门抓麦收工作，抽调了一批干部分工到队，包干到组。为防止收打中出漏洞，各公社还分片组织专人验收，并加强保管工作。
    由于各地认真贯彻了上述的一些措施，广丰县所有的小麦在几天内便抢收完毕，真正做到了又快又好，颗粒归仓。
