    Strengthen Leadership to Guarantee Steel Quality
    Gansu Transfers Thirty-Eight County Party Secretaries and County Heads to Reinforce the Steel Front
    Wuhu Grasps Tightly and Meticulously, Small Blast Furnaces Achieve Large-Scale Bumper Harvests
    (Our newspaper's Lanzhou dispatch, 19th) Gansu Province is strengthening the Party's specific leadership over the steel production front. Addressing the key and weak links in production, it is summarizing and promoting effective technical measures to break through the steel quality barrier and leap forward towards the goal of high quality and high output.
    Gansu Province has established thirty small-scale, foreign-style furnace steel base areas. In order to break through the steel quality barrier, especially for pig iron, the Gansu Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has successively selected thirty-eight county party secretaries and county heads to serve as party secretaries and factory directors of newly built steel plants. It has also transferred more than 150 department-level and section-level cadres from various counties to serve as furnace chiefs and other grassroots leadership positions, universally strengthening leadership at all levels. After arriving at their new posts, most of these cadres applied the mass line and the leadership method of "grasping early, grasping firmly, and grasping to the end." They widely established "secretary experimental furnaces" with different characteristics, implemented a system of cadres going to the furnaces for mass consultation, presented tasks and difficulties to the masses, mobilized the masses to overcome difficulties, and launched a technical innovation and technical revolution movement. Production conditions have improved significantly. Zhao Deming, the county party secretary of Huicheng County, was transferred to Xiaoche Steel Plant as the first party secretary. Not long after, his 15-cubic-meter experimental furnace has been producing safely for fifty-four consecutive days, becoming the plant's "Red Flag, high-yield, long-life furnace."
    Recently, the province convened small blast furnace chief meetings in different districts. They exchanged experiences on-site. Aiming at the important key and weak links in production, they decided to promote a batch of advanced technical measures and advanced experiences proven effective in practice. In terms of pig iron production, the main measures are to achieve "two big" (concentrating strength to guarantee large furnaces, connecting blowers in parallel to increase air volume) "two more" (more nozzles for hot blast furnace combustion, multiple methods for desulfurization) "five good" (good raw materials, good testing, good operating procedures, good equipment maintenance, good safe production). In order to comprehensively complete the steel production task for May, a red flag emulation campaign centered on technical innovation and technical revolution has been launched more widely and deeply around various key measures.
                      (Lan Ping)
    (Our newspaper's Hefei dispatch, 19th) In Wuhu City, Anhui Province, fifty-four small blast furnaces with a volume of eight cubic meters or more achieved an average utilization coefficient of above one in April and May. The qualification rate of pig iron was 95%, the coke ratio was reduced by 15.58% compared with the first quarter, and the cost was reduced by 27.7%.
    The main reason for the large-scale, high-quality, and high-yield bumper harvest of small blast furnaces in Wuhu City is the resolute promotion of several advanced experiences in improving the quality and output of pig iron in small blast furnaces and the meticulous ideological work done in leading steel production.
    In order to improve operating techniques, many factories in Wuhu City also opened training classes for furnace front team leaders and technical exchange meetings for crushed ore workers. This has played an important role in guaranteeing the improvement of pig iron quality and output. Many factories, in the case of lack of equipment and technicians, set up simplified laboratories and adhered to the inspection system for pig iron quality.
    In order to strengthen leadership, after the Wuhu Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party arranged the monthly plan, it focused on grasping the daily plan for each furnace, requiring each factory and each furnace to report the day's production situation to the Municipal Party Committee Steel Group. The Municipal Party Committee also jointly studied how to improve the quality of steel with the heads of various steel plants through the reporting meeting every Tuesday and Friday, and the inspection and evaluation meeting every ten days.
    Because the city's work is meticulous and tightly grasped, a situation of double leap forward in quality and output has emerged on the steel front.

    加强领导保证钢铁质量
    甘肃抽调三十八名县委书记和县长充实钢铁战线
    芜湖抓得紧抓得细小高炉获得大面积丰收
    本报兰州19日电　甘肃省加强党对钢铁生产战线的具体领导，并针对生产中的关键和薄弱环节，总结推广行之有效的技术措施，突破钢铁质量关，向优质高产的目标跃进。
    甘肃全省已建立起三十个小洋炉群钢铁基地，为了突破钢铁质量特别是生铁质量关，中共甘肃省委陆续选拔了三十八名县委书记和县长，到各新建钢铁厂担任党委书记和厂长，并在各县抽调了一百五十多名部长、科长级干部担任炉长等基层领导工作，普遍加强了各级领导力量。这批干部到达新工作岗位以后，大都运用群众路线和抓早抓狠抓到底的领导方法，广泛建立不同特点的“书记试验炉”，实行干部到炉群众会诊的制度，向群众交任务交困难，发动群众攻破困难开展技术革新和技术革命运动，生产情况有了显著进步。徽成县县委书记赵德明调往小河钢铁厂担任党委第一书记不久，他的一座十五立方公尺的试验炉已连续安全生产五十四天，成为全厂的“红旗高产长寿炉”。
    最近，全省分区召开了小高炉炉长会议，在现场交流了经验，针对生产中的重要关键和薄弱环节，决定推行一批为实践证明的行之有效的先进技术措施和先进经验。在生铁生产方面，主要措施是实现“两大”（集中力量保证大炉、鼓风机并联加大风量）“两多”（热风炉多嘴燃烧，多种方法脱硫）“五好”
  （原料好、化验好、操作规程好、设备维修好、安全生产好）。为全面地完成5月份钢铁生产任务，已围绕各项关键性措施，更广泛深入地开展以技术革新和技术革命为中心的增产节约红旗竞赛运动。
                      （蓝坪）
    本报合肥19日电　安徽省芜湖市五十四个八立方公尺以上的小高炉，4、5月份的平均利用系数稳定在一以上，生铁合格率为95％，焦比比第一季度降低15.58％，成本降低27.7％。
    芜湖市小高炉取得大面积优质高产丰收的主要原因是坚决推广了几项提高小高炉生铁质量、产量的先进经验，在领导钢铁生产中做了细致的思想工作。
    芜湖市为了提高操作技术，很多厂还开办了炉前组长训练班和碎矿工人技术交流会。这对保证提高生铁质量和产量起了重要的作用。很多厂在设备和技术人员缺乏的情况下，纷纷设立简单化验室，坚持了生铁质量的检查制度。
    为了加强领导，中共芜湖市委安排月计划以后，着重抓每炉的日计划，要求每个厂，每个炉把当天的生产情况，向市委钢铁小组汇报；市委还通过每星期二、五的汇报会，每十天的检查评比会，和各个钢铁厂的负责人共同研究如何提高钢铁质量的问题。
    这个市由于工作细致、抓得紧，在钢铁战线上，已经出现了质量产量双跃进的局面。
