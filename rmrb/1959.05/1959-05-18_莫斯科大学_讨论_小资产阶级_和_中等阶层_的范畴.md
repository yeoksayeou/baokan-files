According to a report by A. Shpeinov published recently in the Moscow University Journal, the Party History Teaching and Research Office and the Modern History Teaching and Research Office of Moscow University held a joint scientific discussion on the contentious issue of the categories of "petty bourgeoisie" and "middle strata." Patrykeev and Chastyakov each presented special reports at the meeting, clarifying their viewpoints and disagreeing with each other's opinions. Sixteen people expressed their opinions at the meeting.

In his report, Patrykeev criticized Chastyakov's views. He said that the petty bourgeoisie referred to in Marxist-Leninist classics are the working peasants, family handicraftsmen, and artisans who are between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie. However, in capitalist society, there are other people who do not occupy a special position in the social production system and do not represent any economic way of life, such as officials at all levels, intellectuals, rentiers, and so on. These people have no common class interests. Some are close to the bourgeoisie, some are close to the petty bourgeoisie, and some are close to the proletariat. In terms of living conditions, they are between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, wavering between revolution and counter-revolution. They reflect the interests of the class they serve. He believes that Chastyakov's mistake lies first in including small and medium capitalists—business owners, merchants, rentiers, etc.—in the category of the petty bourgeoisie. He said that this would inevitably obliterate class lines, obscure antagonistic class contradictions, and thus broaden the boundaries of the alliance between the working class and the working masses, the petty bourgeoisie, and include urban and rural small capitalists (in the countryside, rich peasants) in this alliance.

Patrykeev believes that the middle strata in capitalist society are the broad working masses between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie who belong to the petty bourgeoisie. He said that Chastyakov is wrong to include business owners, merchants, and rentiers in the middle strata because this would confuse different kinds of social strata and obliterate class lines.

In his report, Chastyakov argued that Patrykeev's definition of the petty bourgeoisie as working people who are commodity producers with their own means of production without using hired labor is unscientific. Because within the composition of the petty bourgeoisie, small operators who do not stop working themselves but also exploit hired labor, that is, small business owners and small merchants who can obtain a portion of surplus value through exploitation, are constantly formed. He said that Patrykeev's main mistake is excluding the point that the petty bourgeoisie also exploits hired labor in the definition of the essence of the petty bourgeoisie. Therefore, small business owners and small merchants are classified into the category of the bourgeoisie. In fact, the only difference between the petty bourgeoisie and the capitalists is that they also labor themselves.

Chastyakov believes that the "middle strata" is the sum of those classes and social strata that are in an intermediate state between the proletariat and the big bourgeoisie. There is no difference between the concept of "middle strata" and the concept of "middle class." He believes that the middle strata is a complex collection of various social groups and strata in its composition. Among them, there are also reactionaries who must be resolutely fought against, as well as elements who are loyal to the ruling class—the rich peasant class.

During the discussion, the vast majority agreed with Patrykeev's opinion and criticized Chastyakov's opinion, believing that his classification of small and medium capitalists and rentiers into the petty bourgeoisie and middle strata would blur the class lines in modern capitalist society. In particular, it is a serious mistake to include rich peasants, reactionary bourgeoisie, and intellectuals, police, soldiers, gendarmes, and other strata serving the ruling class in the middle strata.

    莫斯科大学
    讨论“小资产阶级”和“中等阶层”的范畴
    根据不久前出版的莫斯科大学学报所载阿·施培诺夫的报道，莫斯科大学苏共党史教研室和现代史教研室，在一次联合举行的科学讨论会上，讨论了在争论中的关于
  “小资产阶级”和“中等阶层”的范畴问题。帕特里凯夫和查斯天凯尔在会上分别作了专题报告，阐明了他们的观点，和对方意见异议。会上有十六人发表了意见。
    帕特里凯夫在他的报告中，批评了查斯天凯尔的观点。他说，马克思列宁主义经典著作中所指的小资产阶级，是那些处在无产阶级和资产阶级之间的劳动农民、家庭手工业者、手工业者。但是在资本主义社会中，还有另一些在社会生产体系中不占特别地位，也不代表任何经济生活样式的人，如各级官吏、知识分子、食利者等等。这些人没有共同的阶级利益。有的接近资产阶级，有的接近小资产阶级，有的接近无产阶级。在生活状况方面，他们是在无产阶级和资产阶级之间，动摇在革命和反革命之间。他们反映的是他们所服务的阶级的利益。他认为查斯天凯尔的错误，首先是在把中小资本家——企业主、商人、食利者等也划入小资产阶级的范畴。他说，这样必然会抹煞阶级的界线，掩盖对抗性的阶级矛盾，并因而扩大工人阶级同劳动群众、小资产阶级联盟的界线，把城、乡小资本家（在农村是富农）也包括到这一联盟当中来。
    帕特里凯夫认为，资本主义社会的中等阶层，是在无产阶级和资产阶级之间的、属于小资产阶级的广大劳动群众。他说，查斯天凯尔把企业主、商人、食利者也包括在中等阶层内是不对的。因为这会混淆不同种类的社会阶层和抹煞阶级界线。
    查斯天凯尔在他的报告中则认为，帕特里凯夫把小资产阶级规定为不使用雇佣劳动力而自有生产工具的商品生产者的劳动人民，是不科学的。因为在小资产阶级的组成中不断形成那些自己不停止劳动而同时也剥削雇佣劳动的小经营者，即靠剥削可以获得一部分剩余价值的小企业主、小商人。他说，帕特里凯夫的错误主要是：在小资产阶级的实质的定义中排除了小资产阶级也剥削雇佣劳动这一点。因而，便把小企业主和小商人都列入资产阶级的范畴。其实，小资产阶级不同于资本家的，只是他自己也劳动这一点。
    查斯天凯尔认为，“中等阶层”是在无产阶级和大资产阶级之间的那些处于中间状态的阶级和社会阶层的总合。“中等阶层”的概念和
  “中等阶级”的概念没有什么不同。他认为中等阶层是一个在组成上极复杂的各社会集团和阶层的集合体。其中也有必须坚决对其进行斗争的反动分子，以及效忠于统治阶级的分子——富农阶级。
    讨论中绝大多数人都同意帕特里凯夫的意见，而批评了查斯天凯尔的意见，认为他把中、小资本家以及食利者划入小资产阶级、中等阶层，就会模糊现代资本主义社会中的阶级界线。尤其他把富农、反动资产阶级和知识分子、警察、军人、宪兵及其他为统治阶级服务的阶层划在中等阶层内是严重的错误。
