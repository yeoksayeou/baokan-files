Cotton, Corn, Millet, Sweet Potato

Henan Exceeds Spring Planting Plan

Universal Inspection and Acceptance Ensures Area and Quality

(Our newspaper Zhengzhou, 18th dispatch) Henan Province has overfulfilled the state-mandated planting plans for spring-sown cotton, corn, millet, and sweet potatoes. The planting tasks for flue-cured tobacco and sorghum have also been basically completed. Oil crops are currently being planted while the soil moisture is favorable. As of May 11th, the province has planted 35.85 million mu of various spring crops, and most areas have transitioned to field management during the seedling stage, including checking seedlings, replanting, cultivating, weeding, and preventing pests.

The quality of this year's spring-sown crops is generally better than in previous years. Taking cotton as an example, most cotton fields have been ploughed to a depth of six to seven inches, with 5,000 to 7,000 jin of base fertilizer applied per mu, and one-third of the cotton fields have been converted into garden-style fields. Before sowing, most crops underwent seed selection, soaking, and mixing with pesticides, and improved varieties have been widely adopted. In some areas, cadres and the masses lack sufficient understanding of the significance of completing various economic crop planting plans and intend to reduce the planting area for cotton and oil crops. To address this, Party committees at all levels in Henan Province started with ideological education and organized the masses to discuss the significance of "the whole country as a single chessboard." In Zhongmu County, a major oil-producing area, some communes planned to reduce the peanut planting area and proposed planting grain on good land and peanuts on low-lying, waterlogged land. Based on these ideological issues, the Zhongmu County Committee launched a discussion throughout the county on the benefits of planting peanuts according to the state plan for individuals, collectives, and the country, which improved the ideological understanding of the members. They said: We are in a sandy area, and we will not have less clothing to wear if we do not grow cotton; if cotton-producing areas do not complete the cotton planting task according to the state plan, how can we get clothes to wear? The same principle applies: oil-producing areas should plant oil crops according to the state plan, otherwise how can other areas get oil to eat? After the discussion, members of each commune wrote pledges, resolutely overfulfilling the peanut planting plan.

Areas that have completed this year's spring planting tasks have implemented an inspection and acceptance system to ensure the quantity of planting for each crop, while also ensuring that the quality meets the planned requirements. Tongbai County organized 1,018 inspection teams to meticulously inspect the spring-sown land using the method of inserting markers. Through inspection, Xin'an County found that 677 mu of the 5,500 mu of crops planted by Chengguan Commune were not planted to the edges of the fields, and immediately dispatched more than 400 people to replant. Feng Benran, Secretary of the Xixian County Party Committee Secretariat, led an inspection team to Yan Village Production Team of Chengguan Commune and found that the remote land that had been planted with sorghum had not been fertilized at all, and the fertilization amount on other remote land was also very small. Therefore, they held a meeting of commune members to discuss the harms of not applying fertilizer and mobilized the masses to correct the practice of not applying fertilizer. In order to expand the spring planting area and strive for more planting and more harvest, various localities have also seized the opportunity to add crops to abandoned land and vacant land. According to incomplete statistics, the province has used vacant land to plant more than 1.69 million mu of pumpkins, cowpeas, and minor oil crops. (Liu Chuanxun)

### 棉花·玉米·谷子·甘薯  河南超额完成春播计划  普遍检查验收确保面积质量

    棉花·玉米·谷子·甘薯
    河南超额完成春播计划
    普遍检查验收确保面积质量
    本报郑州18日电　河南省各地春播棉花、玉米、谷子、甘薯均已超额完成国家规定的播种计划；烤烟、高粱的种植任务，也基本完成；油料作物正趁墒抢种。到11日为止，全省已经种植了各种春播作物三千五百八十五万亩，大部地区转入了查苗补种、中耕除草、防止虫害等苗期的田间管理。
    今年春播作物的质量一般都比往年好。以棉花为例，大部棉田耕深六至七寸，亩施底肥五千到七千斤，并有三分之一的棉田实现了园田化。播种前大都经过选种、浸种和拌种，普及了优良品种。部分地区的干部和群众对完成各项经济作物种植计划的重大意义认识不足，打算缩小棉花、油料的播种面积。为此，河南省各级党委，从思想教育入手，组织群众讨论了“全国一盘棋”的意义。油料主要产区中牟县，有的社打算缩小花生种植面积，并提出把好地种粮食，低洼易涝的地种花生。中牟县委根据这些思想情况，在全县开展了按照国家计划种植花生对个人、集体和国家有什么好处的讨论，使社员们提高了思想水平。他们说：咱们是沙地区，不种棉花同样不少穿布；如果产棉区不按照国家计划完成种棉任务，咱们能穿到衣服吗？同样道理，油料产区就应该按照国家计划种植油料作物，否则其他地区怎能吃到油呢？各公社的社员们在讨论后纷纷写保证书，坚决超额完成花生种植计划。
    今年春播任务已经完成的地区，都实行了检查验收制度，确保各项作物播种的数量，同时质量也达到计划要求。桐柏县组织了一千零十八个检查组用插标的办法，细致地对春播地进行了验收。新安县通过验收，发现城关公社种的五千五百亩庄稼有六百七十七亩没有种到地头地边，随即抽出四百多人补种。息县县委书记处书记鄷本然带领检查团到城关公社阎寨生产队检查，发现他们已播种上高粱的边远地没有施一点肥，其他的边远地施肥量也很少，于是召开社员大会，讨论不施肥有那些危害，发动群众纠正了不施肥料的作法。为了扩大春播面积，争取多种多收，各地还抓住了废弃地和空闲地加种作物。据不完全统计，全省已经利用空闲地播种南瓜、豆角、小宗油料等一百六十九万多亩。　（刘传勋）
