Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, May 18th. The Wuhan Municipal Electrical Machinery Industry System has launched a mass quality inspection campaign in the increase production and practice economy movement. This inspection began in April, initially with eleven factories, and then gradually expanded to other electrical machinery industry departments. By early May, two-thirds of the city's factories had launched quality inspection movements. Through this inspection, the product quality of each factory has been significantly improved.

In the quality inspection movement, factories generally mobilize the masses to conduct extensive airing of views, big debates, and in combination with leadership, jointly study measures to improve quality. Wuhan Foundry workers, through debate, clarified the three erroneous ideas held by a few people: "More and faster cannot be good and economical," "Dare to think, dare to speak, dare to act inevitably leads to reckless words and deeds," and "The production of defective products has nothing to do with oneself." They seriously criticized the shortcomings of neglecting production and technical management. Now, all the factory workers are very concerned about quality. Some workers check for defective products as soon as they come to work every day, and immediately analyze the causes and jointly study prevention methods. The Wuhan Machine Tool Accessories Factory adopted the method of conducting thematic airing of views on quality from point to surface, and also held quality exhibitions and set up quality pacesetters, selecting typical figures who consistently value quality and abide by operating procedures for education among all employees, which also achieved good results.

After the mass airing of views and debates, each factory struck while the iron was hot, taking active measures to improve and establish management systems related to production management, quality inspection, production command, and handover acceptance. Many factories have established leading bodies specifically in charge of quality through large-scale inspections, holding regular meetings to check quality. In addition to universally restoring the pre-shift research, post-shift inspection, and shift handover systems in each group, the Wuhan Machine Tool Accessories Factory also focused on implementing a combination of self-inspection, mutual inspection, and full-time inspection, establishing a mass inspection system to ensure product quality.

Through the launch of the mass quality inspection, each factory has initially achieved results. The scrap rate of Wuhan Foundry's casting products has dropped from 22.85% in late March to the current 8.45%, with some workshops even dropping to around 3%. Since the Wuhan Wire Factory implemented the "four determinations" and "three guarantees" management system of determining machine tools, personnel, quality, and output, and guaranteeing quality, safety, and technology, the scrap rate has also dropped from 15% to 0.9%.

Currently, electrical and mechanical industrial enterprises throughout the city are successively holding meetings mainly attended by four-level cadres (i.e., factory, workshop, section, and group) and also absorbing worker representatives, to further rectify and improve the management level of enterprises, so that the electrical and mechanical industry can better achieve high output on the premise of high quality.

Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, May 18th. The Guo Yannian casting team of the Shanxi Machine Factory, in the high-quality and high-yield red flag competition, launched a movement to eliminate defective products. For nearly a month, they have not produced a single defective product. The factory leadership recently held an on-site meeting, using the Guo Yannian team as a pacesetter, and launched a movement to eliminate defective products throughout the factory. Now, the number of defect-free teams in the factory is increasing day by day. The casting workshop, which had always believed that "defective products cannot be eliminated," has recently also had Wang Ying, Zhang Chunquan, and other teams become defect-free teams.

After launching the high-quality and high-yield red flag competition, the Guo Yannian team tried to reduce the scrap rate of castings from the original 6.96% to 3.6%, which was 1.4% lower than the factory's competition target. Entering April, the team further took measures. When discussing tasks in production meetings and Party, trade union, and Communist Youth League group meetings, they listed reducing the casting scrap rate as the most important agenda item. When defective products are found in production, they immediately study the causes and take preventive measures.

In the process of eliminating defective products, the Guo Yannian team paid special attention to complying with process regulations. Their specific measures were: Mutual aid groups clarify the division of labor, maintain close contact, supervise each other, and carry out competitions to comply with process regulations; the team leader and mutual aid group leader check the implementation of the process at any time, strengthen intermediate inspection, and correct immediately when non-conforming to drawing specifications; and contact the inspection personnel in a timely manner, check the products of the previous day every day, strengthen quality analysis, and solve problems in a timely manner.

    开展群众性质量大检查
    武汉机电系统上下提措施确保质量　山西机器厂大家动手消灭废品
    新华社武汉18日电　武汉市机电工业系统在增产节约运动中，开展了群众性的质量大检查。这个检查是在4月间首先从十一个工厂开始，以后逐渐扩展到其他机电工业部门。到5月上旬，全市已有三分之二的工厂开展了质量检查运动。通过这次检查，各厂的产品质量已经有了显著的提高。
    各个工厂在质量检查运动中，一般都是发动群众围绕质量问题开展大鸣大放大辩论，上下结合共同研究提高质量的措施。武汉铸造厂职工由于通过辩论澄清了少数人存在的“要多、快就不能好、省”、
  “敢想、敢说、敢干免不了乱说、乱干”、“产生废品与自己无关”等三种错误思想，严肃批判了忽视生产和技术管理的缺点，现在全厂职工都非常关心质量，有的工人每天上班就首先检查有没有废品，发现废品就立即分析原因，共同研究防止办法。武汉机床附件厂采取由点到面进行质量专题鸣放的方法，并且同时举办了质量展览和树立质量标兵，评选出一贯重视质量、遵守操作规程的典型人物，在全体职工中进行教育，也收到了很好的效果。
    经过群众性鸣放辩论以后，各厂都趁热打铁，采取积极措施健全和建立有关生产管理、质量检查、生产指挥、交接验收等管理制度。许多工厂通过大检查成立了专管质量的领导机构，定期开会检查质量。武汉机床附件厂除了普遍恢复各小组的班前研究、班后检查和交接班制度外，还着重实行了自检互检与专职检验相结合的办法，建立了群众性的检验制度，以保证产品质量。
    通过开展群众性质量大检查，各个工厂已经初步收到了效果。武汉铸造厂铸件产品的废品率，已经从3月下旬的22.85％下降到目前的8.45％，有的车间甚至降到3％左右。武汉电线厂自从贯彻定机台、定人员、定质量、定产量和保质量、保安全、保技术的“四定”“三保”管理制度以后，废品率也由15％降为0.9％。
    目前，全市机电工业企业正在陆续召开以四级干部（即厂、车间、工段、小组）为主并吸收职工代表参加的会议，进一步整顿和提高企业的管理水平，使机电工业更好地作到在优质的前提下实现高产。
    据新华社太原18日电　山西机器厂郭延年铸工小组在优质高产红旗竞赛中，展开了消灭废品的运动，将近一个月来没有出过一件废品，工厂领导方面最近召开现场会议，以郭延年小组为标兵，在全厂发动了消灭废品的运动。现在，全厂无废品小组一天天在增加。过去一直认为“消灭不了废品”的铸工车间，最近也已有王英、张春泉等小组成了无废品小组。
    郭延年小组在开展优质高产红旗竞赛以后，就设法把铸件的报废
  率由原来的6.96％降低到3.6％，比厂的竞赛指标降低了1.4％。进入4月，这个小组又进一步采取了措施。他们在生产会议和党、工、团小组会上讨论任务的时候，把降低铸件报废率列为最重要的议程。在生产中发现了废品，立即研究原因，采取防止的措施。
    郭延年小组在消灭废品过程中，特别注意了遵守工艺规程。他们的具体措施是：互助组明确分工，密切联系，互相监督，开展遵守工艺规程的竞赛；组长和互助组长随时检查贯彻工艺的情况，加强中间检查，发现不合图纸规格时，立即纠正；和检验人员及时联系，每天检查前一日的产品，加强质量分析，发现问题及时解决。
