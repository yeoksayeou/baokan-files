Xinhua News Agency, May 24th -- The men's and women's gymnastics teams of the Georgian Republic of the Soviet Union held their final friendly match with the Chinese men's and women's gymnastics teams in China today afternoon in Beijing. The visiting team won both matches. The men's team won against the Chinese men's team by 2.5 points (282.35 points - 279.85 points); the women's team won against the Chinese women's team by 1.82 points (184.51 points - 182.69 points) (both men's and women's teams calculated the total scores of the five best athletes).

The friendly match took place in the competition hall of the Beijing Gymnasium for four and a half hours. The various wonderful optional gymnastic routines performed by the athletes of both sides won warm applause from more than 6,000 spectators.

The Georgian men's gymnastics team was the fourth-place winner in the All-Soviet Gymnastics Competition last year. The team members all have powerful movements and average skills. In the six events, most of the scores were above 9 points (full score of 10 points). Among them, the technical level of the vault, free exercise, horizontal bar, and parallel bars were particularly average, with the lowest score being 9.3 points. Kachakhidze, the champion of the 1958 All-Soviet University Gymnastics Competition and the champion of the Georgian Republic, and L. Sharabidze, a Soviet master of sports, won the single-event championships in the horizontal bar and long horse vault with 9.65 points respectively. Kachakhidze also won the second place in the men's individual all-around with a total score of 56.9 points (full score of 60 points).

The men's individual all-around champion was won by Yu Lie-feng, a 19-year-old from the Chinese team. His total score was 57.3 points. Yu Lie-feng also won three single-event championships today with accurate and beautiful movements - free exercise 9.55 points, pommel horse 9.65 points, and parallel bars 9.7 points.

Ye Yi-da, an 18-year-old from the Chinese men's team, also shared the first place in the parallel bars with 9.7 points. Bao Nai-jian won the rings championship with a score of 9.7 points.

The Georgian women's gymnastics team, which ranked fifth in the All-Soviet Union in 1958, also demonstrated skilled gymnastic techniques today. They successfully interspersed many light and graceful dance movements in the free exercise and balance beam routines, which were particularly attractive. Ninoshvili, the champion of the All-Soviet Junior Gymnastics Competition in 1957 and 1958, won two single-event championships alone - free exercise (9.5 points) and balance beam (9.46 points). Soviet master of sports Kazaya won the third place in the individual all-around with a total score of 37.31 points (full score of 40 points).

The Chinese women's gymnastics team was not calm enough in today's competition. Some team members repeatedly made mistakes in the balance beam and uneven bars competitions, which resulted in more points being deducted. Guo Ke-yu, 19, and Wang Yu-mei, 21, performed relatively well. They won the individual all-around championship and runner-up with 37.61 points and 37.39 points respectively. Guo Ke-yu also won the single-event championships in the uneven bars and horizontal vault with the same score - 9.56 points.

After the friendly match, Cai Tingkai, Deputy Director of the State Physical Culture and Sports Commission, presented awards to the winning gymnastics teams and athletes.

    格鲁吉亚体操队同中国体操队举行友谊赛
    新华社24日讯　苏联格鲁吉亚共和国男、女体操队，今天下午在北京同中国男、女体操队举行了访华最后一次友谊比赛，结果客队双双获胜。男子队赢了中国男子队二点五分（二八二点三五分——二七九点八五分）；女子队赢了中国女子队一点八二分（一八四点五一分——一八二点六九分）（男、女队双方都是计算成绩最好五名选手的得分总和）。
    友谊比赛在北京体育馆比赛馆中进行了四个半钟头，双方运动员表演的各种精采的体操自选动作，都博得了六千多名观众的热烈掌声。
    格鲁吉亚男子体操队是去年全苏体操第四名，队员个个动作有力、技术平均，在六个项目的比赛中，绝大多数得分都在九分以上（满分十分）。其中跳马、自由体操、单杠和双杠四项技术水平尤为平均，最少的也得了九点三分。1958年全苏大学生体操比赛冠军、格鲁吉亚共和国冠军卡恰希泽，和苏联运动健将列·沙拉比泽，都以九点六五分分别取得了单杠和纵跳马两个单项冠军。卡恰希泽还以五十六点九分的总分（满分六十分），取得了男子个人全能亚军。
    男子个人全能冠军被中国队十九岁的于烈烽夺得，他的总分是五十七点三分。于烈烽今天还以准确而漂亮的动作，赢得了三个单项冠军——自由体操九点五五分、鞍马九点六五分、双杠九点七分。
    中国男子队十八岁的叶贻达也以九点七分同获双杠第一名。鲍乃健得吊环冠军，得分是九点七分。
    1958年全苏第五名的格鲁吉亚女子体操队，今天也表演了熟练的体操技巧。她们在自由体操和平衡木动作中，都成功地穿插了许多轻盈优美的舞蹈动作，格外引人入胜。1957年和1958年全苏少年体操比赛冠军、十八岁的尼诺什维利，一个人就夺得了自由体操（九点五分）和平衡木（九点四六分）两个单项冠军。苏联运动健将卡扎娅以三十七点三一分的总分（满分四十分），获得了个人全能第三名。
    中国女子体操队今天在比赛中不够沉着，有的队员在平衡木和高低杠比赛中连连失手，被扣了比较多的分数。表现比较出色的是十九岁的郭可愚和二十一岁的王毓玫，她们分别以三十七点六一分和三十七点三九分获得了个人全能冠军和亚军。郭可愚还以同样的分数——九点五六分，分别获得了高低杠和横跳马两个单项冠军。
    友谊比赛结束以后，国家体委副主任蔡廷锴向获得优胜的体操队和运动员们发了奖。
