My hometown is located on the western edge of the southern Taihang Mountains. I not only grew up and went to school there, but also worked in that mountainous area until the national liberation. Because of this historical connection, even after I left the area after liberation, I always wanted to go back and see it whenever I had the chance.

This area became an old base area of the Anti-Japanese War as early as 1937; after liberation, it was naturally like other old base areas, although it cannot be said that it was always at the forefront, it can at least be said that it was unwilling to lag behind in anything. Every time I went back, I could always encounter some new things. Most of the novels I have written are based on this area.

Last winter (1958), I returned to my hometown again. Last year was a year of great leap forward, and there were more new things than usual. The first thing that struck me as new was the newly built canteen after the communization. This was a row of new houses facing south, with the kitchen at the west end and the dining hall at the east end. There was a well in the kitchen—an old well was enclosed in this new house, so there was no need to fetch water from outside; the coal feeding port and the ash pit were all outside the wall, so there was no fire or dust inside. In the dining hall, there were two rows of square tables, with four benches around each table; there was a fairly wide path in the middle, and two ground stoves were burning. The children who could not reach the tables loved to eat around the stoves.

When I ate my first meal in this canteen, I first expressed my feelings to the brigade cadres. I said that the first thing I felt was that the canteen was built very well, but at the beginning of the establishment of the commune, it was a bit extravagant to build such a row of houses with the strength of only seventy or so households. Before the team cadres had time to answer, the people at several tables nearby all laughed. Someone suggested that I estimate the cost. I was not good at it and couldn't estimate it for a while. While I was estimating, someone advised me to simply not bother. Later, everyone told me that the construction of this house not only did not require any craftsmen or the purchase of any materials, but also did not take up many regular workdays. Most of it was done by the commune members after work, carrying stones and pounding adobe bricks, using their spare time, and it was completed in just over ten days; the materials were also pieced together by everyone. When the working people create something, it sometimes feels like magic.

Seeing such a canteen that didn't cost much money and was of good quality certainly made me very happy, but as soon as I saw the foundation of the canteen, I slowly began to think of many old friends:

This place is called "South Courtyard Entrance." In the front courtyard of the South Courtyard lived a relative of mine. There were originally three brothers, about the same age as my father, but in terms of seniority, they were my peers. The eldest brother was named Xigui. Back then, because he had no land to cultivate, he farmed mountain land in Anze County and died there without ever getting married. The third brother was named Gelun. In his youth, he was considered a labor hero in the area, but later, because he had no good land to cultivate and the yield of the poor land was too low, he had no heart to suffer and changed his ways to thievery, eventually being beaten half to death and buried by the clan. His experience was a bit like the Ah Q written by Mr. Lu Xun. I once thought of writing a "biography" for him, but in the end, I didn't. These two old brothers were thus deprived of their lives by poverty, and didn't even leave any descendants.

The east end of the canteen is called "Yintou Shang." This courtyard used to be inhabited by two brothers. They were also about the same age as my father, surnamed Lü. The eldest was named Shuancheng, whom I called Uncle; the second was named Suicheng, whom I called Uncle. These two had nothing but the house they lived in. That old Uncle Shuancheng died of typhoid fever, leaving behind two children. The eldest starved to death in a famine year, and the second lived in his uncle's house until the land reform, when he returned and is now a squad leader. Uncle Suicheng, like my brother Xigui, never married and was poisoned to death by a piece of dead beef that had been infected with snake venom.

To the south of the canteen lived a family surnamed Feng. Neither the father nor the son had a plot of land. The son was named Fugui, whom I called brother, and he also starved to death while begging for food. My novel "Fugui" is partly based on his life.

Behind Brother Fugui's house, there was a courtyard called "East Courtyard," where lived a family surnamed Lü, four brothers. I called two of them Uncle and two of them Uncle. They were all carpenters, but they only had a few acres of very poor land. In my hometown area, being a craftsman was almost a side job, and it was very difficult to make a living entirely from it. Of the four of them, only the youngest married after the age of thirty, and the three older brothers never married (the second found an old companion when he was fifty or sixty). They all loved folk music, and the instruments of the Bayin Society were kept in their home for a long time. I learned to play the gongs and drums mostly in their home. Now they are all deceased, and only the youngest left a child. The youngest was called Liuniu. This old uncle also fled during a famine year and died outside. His child has already settled down elsewhere.

To the northeast of the East Courtyard, there used to be a large walnut tree, and under the tree were two ancient stone kilns, without even doors and windows. However, these two stone kilns sheltered quite a few people—people who fled to this village from Henan after the floods almost all lived here at first, some for a short period of time and some for several years. The "old generation" people in my "Li Youcai Ballad" are mostly based on this. When people from our village fled to other places and started as "old generation" people, they might not all have found such good places to live.

...

These old friends, numbering over a hundred (including those from neighboring villages, there would be several hundred). These familiar, kind faces, scattered east and west, dying and perishing, most of them did not even leave any descendants. If they had not been forced to death by poverty and famine in the old society and could have lived to this day, many of them would certainly be leading cadres or labor heroes, and they would all be happily eating in this new canteen at this time.

Because I was counting these old friends, I ate a little slowly and didn't notice that the adults had already finished eating and gone to work, leaving only a group of pre-school children around the stove. These little darlings were not shy at all. Seeing that the adults were gone, several of them surrounded me, asking me where I came from. One of them even called out my name (probably the adults had pointed at me and quietly told them). I stroked their heads with both hands and pointed to each of them, asking their names. The quick-tongued ones pointed to each of them and introduced them to me, saying his name was little something, his name was little something, but I didn't remember a single one, only remembering the word "little" before each name. I feel that these can also be said to be "little generation" people, but much happier than the little generation people I wrote about in "Li Youcai Ballad." They will never understand what it means to "flee famine."

    新食堂里忆故人
    赵树理
    我的故乡，在太行山南端的西边。我不但在那地方生长、上学，而且直到全国大解放以前，都在那个山区工作。因为有这样的历史关系，我在解放以后虽然离开了那里，但一有机会，总想回去看看。
    这个地区，远在1937年就成了抗日战争的老根据地；解放以后，自然也和其他老根据地一样，虽然不能说事事走在前边，至少也可以说事事不甘落后。我每次回去，总能碰到一些新鲜的事物。我所写的小说，大部分取材于这个地区。
    去年（1958年）冬天，我又回到我的故乡去。去年是个大跃进年，新鲜事要比往常多。首先使我感到新鲜的，是公社化以后新建的食堂。这是一列座北向南的新房子，西头是厨房，东头是饭厅。厨房里有井——是把一眼旧井包在这新房里的，用水不要到外边挑；灶火的添煤口和出灰渣的坑都在墙外，里边用火不见火，没有一点灰尘。饭厅里摆着两列方桌，每张桌周围有四条板凳；中间留着相当宽的路，烧着两个地炉，还探不着桌子的孩子们，在吃饭时候都爱围着火炉子吃。
    当我在这食堂吃第一顿饭的时候，便先向大队干部发表我的感想。我说我首先感觉到的是食堂修得很得劲，但在建立公社之初，以一个七十来户的力量来修建这样一列房子，未免有些铺张浪费。队干部还没有来得及回答我的话，附近几张桌子上的人就一齐笑了。有人提出来让我估一下费用。我不太在行，一时估不出，正在估计中，有人劝我说干脆不要费那个事。后来大家才告我说，修这房子不但没有请什么匠人、购什么材料，而且正规的劳动日也没有占用好多，大部分是社员们在下工之后抬石头、捣土坯，用业余时间搞起来的，而且只突击了十来天就落成了；材料也是大家拼凑的。劳动人民创造起什么来，有时候真像变戏法。
    看到这样个花钱不多、质量不坏的食堂，固然使我很高兴，可是一看到食堂的地基，就慢慢联想起好多故人来：
    这地方叫“南院门口”。南院的前院里住着我的一户本家，原是弟兄三个，论年岁都和我父亲的年纪差不多，只是按辈数和我是平辈。老大哥名叫喜贵，当年因为没有地种，在安泽县种山地，没有结过婚就死到那里了。老三名叫各轮，青年时期要算当地的劳动英雄，后来也因为没有好地种，坏地产量太少，无心受苦，改学梁上君子，结果被族里人打了个半死埋了。他的遭遇和鲁迅先生写的阿Q有点相像，当年我也曾想给他写“正传”，后来终于没有写成。这两位老兄，就是这样被贫困夺去了生命，连个后代也没有留下。
    食堂的东头，叫“窨头上”。这院从前也住着弟兄两个。他们也和我父亲的年岁相仿，姓吕，老大名叫拴成，我称伯伯；老二名叫随成，我称叔叔。这两位，除了住的房子以外，再没有什么产业。那位老拴成伯伯是伤寒病死的，死后留下两个孩子，大的在一个灾荒年饿死了，二的一直住在舅家，直到土改时候才回来，现在是一位小队长。随成叔也和我那位喜贵哥一样，没有结过婚，被一块中了蛇毒的死牛肉给吃死了。
    食堂的南边有一户姓冯的，父子两代都没有一垅地。孩子名叫福归，我称哥哥，也是在外讨饭被饿死的。我写的小说“福贵”，有一部分就是他的生活。
    福归哥的房背后，有个院子叫“东头院”，住着一户姓吕的，弟兄四个，我对他们其中两个称伯伯，两个称叔叔。他们都会木工，但只有几亩很坏的地。在我的家乡一带，当工匠差不多是副业，完全靠它生活是很困难的。他们四位，只有老四在三十岁以后才结了婚，三位当哥哥的都没有结过婚（老二到五六十岁也找过个老伴）。他们都爱好民间音乐，八音会的乐器长期存在他们家里。我爱打打锣鼓大半也是在他们家学会的。现在他们都去世了，只老四留下一个孩子。老四叫六牛。这位老叔叔也是灾荒年逃荒出去死在外边的。他的孩子已经在外边落了户。
    东头院的东北，当年有一株大核桃树，树下有两孔古石窑，连门窗都没有。不过这两孔石窑庇护的人可真不少——河南遭了水灾逃荒到这村里的人，开始差不多都在这里住过，有的短时期找不到住处，还有住过几年的。我写“李有才板话”中的“老字辈”人，好多取材于这里。我们村里当年逃荒出去的人，到外边开始当“老字辈”人的时候，未必都能碰到这样好的住处。
    ……
    这些故人，数起来要上百（连邻近村里的数要够好几百）。这些熟悉的善良的面孔，东逃西散，死的死亡的亡，大多数连个后人也没有留下。假如他们不是被旧社会的贫穷和灾荒逼死而能活到现在，一定有好多是领导干部或者劳动英雄，这时候一定都欢聚在这个新食堂吃饭。
    我因为数算这些故人，饭吃得慢了一点，没有注意到大人们都已经吃过饭干活去了，只剩下围着火炉的一群学龄以下的儿童。这伙小宝贝们也不认生，见大人走了，有几个围着我来，问我是哪里来的，其中有个叫出我的名字来（可能是大人指着我悄悄告他说过的）。我以两只手在他们头上摸来摸去，又指着每个问他们的名字。嘴快的指着每一个介绍给我说他叫小什么、他叫小什么，可是我连一个也没有记住，每一个名字前边只记了个“小”字。我觉着这也可以说是些“小字辈”人物吧，不过比我在“李有才板话”中写的那些小字辈人物幸福多了。他们将永远不会再懂得什么叫“逃荒”。
