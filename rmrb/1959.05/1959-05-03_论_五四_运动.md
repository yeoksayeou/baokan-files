On the May Fourth Movement
Li Shu

I.

The May Fourth Movement of 1919 was a powerful patriotic democratic movement that was bound to occur after the imperialist invasion of China, and it is the main symbol of the entire ideological movement of that period. Imperialist aggression turned China into a semi-independent country. China began to adopt capitalist modes of production under the terror of extinction. Imperialism made a fortune in China, but it also created revolutionary forces against itself. The process of imperialist plunder in China, the process of the Chinese people's bankruptcy, was also the process of growth and awakening of Chinese revolutionaries. In the first few decades after the Opium War, we could only see the simple resistance of Chinese peasants and handicraftsmen. After the Sino-Japanese War of 1894, we gradually saw the bourgeois movement to transform China according to the model of Western capitalist countries. The Hundred Days' Reform was an attempt of this movement from top to bottom, and the Xinhai Revolution was the revolutionary outbreak of this movement. However, the imperialists and feudalists, as enemies of the Chinese revolution, were not clearly recognized by the majority of people at the time of the Xinhai Revolution. The spearhead of the revolution was not directly aimed at these two main enemies, but at their tool—the Qing Dynasty government. The republic that arose with the collapse of the Qing Dynasty government was not built on the basis of revolutionary victory, but on the basis of compromise with imperialism and feudalism. The emperor-like activities and retrogressive activities of Yuan Shikai, the president of the republic, quickly made the bourgeoisie, especially the petty bourgeoisie, feel that they had not obtained real benefits from the revolution. The Japanese imperialist aggression of occupying the entire Shandong province under the pretext of declaring war on Germany in the early days of World War I aroused serious vigilance among the Chinese people regarding the national crisis. However, Yuan Shikai continued to collude with Japan, attempting to rely on its support to ascend the throne of emperor. The continued development of foreign aggression and domestic political crisis forced people to reconsider the future of the Chinese nation. Thus, a new liberation movement—the May Fourth Movement—emerged.

Before the May Fourth Movement, the "New Youth" (originally named "Youth") magazine began a fierce ideological revolution against the doctrines of Confucius. This ideological revolution was called the New Culture Movement because it demanded the introduction and popularization of democratic ideas and scientific spirit in China. This movement was a direct response to Yuan Shikai's enthronement and call for honoring Confucius and restoring ancient ways in the ideological circles. The authors of "New Youth" believed that the Xinhai Revolution did not fundamentally change the entire superstructure of Chinese society, and Yuan Shikai's enthronement was not an isolated or accidental event. Among the general public at the time, the systems and customs of the Qing Dynasty were still the criteria for handling affairs. Government officials were full of old ideas from the monarchical era and did not understand what a republican system was at all. Members of Congress advocated honoring Confucius and demanded that Confucianism be designated as the state religion. Many revolutionaries lost their revolutionary will and were assimilated by the reactionaries. Many people claimed to be "new figures," but their ideas were actually outdated. Among the masses, backward ideas continued to exist in large numbers. Superstition was not eradicated. Many people still believed that the Manchu emperor would have a day to "sit on the dragon throne again." The prominent existence of this phenomenon showed that the Xinhai Revolution, like in the political field, was also incomplete in the ideological field.

The New Culture Movement was an enlightenment movement, a continuation of the Xinhai Revolution in the ideological field. Its role was to awaken people's democratic consciousness and become conscious opponents of the feudal system and conscious supporters of the republican system. The lack of such a thorough ideological movement before the Xinhai Revolution was a reflection of the weakness and underdevelopment of Chinese national capital. The emergence of this movement after the Xinhai Revolution was a reflection of the development of Chinese national capital during the war. The fundamental interests of Chinese national capital conflicted with imperialism, so although this movement arose in opposition to feudalism, its development would inevitably point the spearhead of the revolution at imperialism at the same time. The decline of the capitalist system and the victory of the socialist system after the war would inevitably lead some radical democrats and patriots who led this movement to place their hope for national liberation on contact with the international workers' movement, on contact with the great workers' state, the Soviet Union, and transform themselves into socialists. All these developments were completely logical and inevitable.

II.

Chen Duxiu's "A Word to Youth," published in the first issue of "New Youth," first put forward a central idea, that is, China needs to "change course," believing that China's old culture and social system were nearly a thousand years behind Europe, and were worthless, even saying, "I would rather endure the demise of past national essence than endure the current and future nation not adapting to the world's survival and being wiped out." Chen Duxiu called on young people to liberate themselves from the shackles of Confucian doctrines, to become independent and autonomous individuals, to understand China's position in the world, and to rise up for self-salvation with a pragmatic and progressive spirit. Chen Duxiu believed that in order to get rid of ignorance, China "should attach equal importance to science and human rights," establish agriculture with modern technology and independent modern industry, and use scientific knowledge to break superstition. "New Youth" magazine published a series of articles attacking the doctrines of Confucius, regarding it as the greatest enemy hindering the awakening of the Chinese people. In the article "1916," Chen Duxiu believed that "the three cardinal guides of Confucianists are the great source of all morality and politics. If the ruler is the guide of the minister, then the people are appendages to the ruler and have no independent personality; if the father is the guide of the son, then the son is an appendage to the father and has no independent personality; if the husband is the guide of the wife, then the wife is an appendage to the husband and has no independent personality. If all the men and women in the world are ministers, sons, and wives and there is not a single independent person, it is caused by the three cardinal guides. From this arise moral terms that are golden rules, such as loyalty, filial piety, and chastity, which are not the moralities of the master who extends oneself to others, but the moralities of the slave who subjects oneself to others. All human actions are centered on the self, and if this is lost, what else is there to say." In the article "Our Final Awakening," Chen Duxiu pointed out that the feudal social system and the republican system are incompatible. "If we truly want to adopt a republican constitutional system in politics, and still want to preserve the cardinal guides and class system in ethics, in order to achieve the effect of harmonizing the old and the new, it is absolutely impossible to reconcile. The republican constitutional system takes independence, equality, and freedom as its principles, which are absolutely incompatible with the cardinal guides and class system; to preserve one must abolish the other. If we deny autocracy in politics, but still preserve the old privileges in the family and society, then the principles of legal equality and economically independent production will be completely destroyed, and there will be no room for coexistence." This idea was further extended to the incompatibility of China's traditional old culture and Western imported new culture. The authors of "New Youth" demanded the replacement of the old culture with the new culture in order to realize the ideal of "establishing a new Western-style country and organizing a new Western-style society." Thus, in order to make the new culture universally accepted by people, it was even more necessary to oppose the old culture. Wu Yu, a famous scholar from Sichuan, responded to this struggle and wrote several articles in succession to expose the essence of the feudal family system and feudal morality, making sharp attacks on the Confucian doctrines that maintained the feudal system and moral views. Lu Xun, the great mentor of modern Chinese literature, exclaimed "The rites eat people" in his first short story "Diary of a Madman," accusing the relationship between people in Chinese feudal society of being merely a relationship of "eating and being eaten." Lu Xun's many exquisite essays deeply struck the ills of the old society. He lashed out at various backward phenomena everywhere and enthusiastically called for the growth of new forces.

The violent attacks of "New Youth" magazine on feudalism stirred up the entire ideological circles. It even made bourgeois elements who fundamentally opposed revolution get involved in the revolutionary wave for a time. Hu Shi was one of them. Before the Xinhai Revolution, Hu Shi was a contributor to popular magazines and was studying in the United States at the time. "New Youth" influenced him, and he proposed reforms to the old style of Chinese literature, opposing imitation of the ancients and advocating the use of vernacular. Hu Shi's proposed reforms were the inevitable development of the anti-feudal ideological revolution. The old literary style was inseparable from the feudal ideas it reflected. It had become rigid in a long period of stagnation. Although there were still many things to be absorbed, on the whole, it had no vitality, was not sufficient to express modern life, and was even less sufficient to express scientific ideas. In the deepening of the struggle, it inevitably came under attack along with feudal ideas. Hu Shi's proposal was obviously derived from the discussion of "New Youth" magazine on unifying language and writing and creating a unified national language, so once it was put forward, it immediately received the support of the authors of "New Youth," and they further called for a literary revolution, demanding the establishment of a national realistic social literature or popular literature, fundamentally abandoning the prevailing formalistic old literature. This new call caused a wider shock in the ideological circles, rapidly leading the struggle to a climax. The ancient prose of the Tongcheng School, which had become orthodox literature since the eighteenth century, was called a "misleading seed." Qian Xuantong, a famous professor of linguistics, expressed extremely biased ideas, opposing the reading of Chinese books and advocating the fundamental abolition of Chinese characters. Qian Xuantong believed that Chinese classical works were nothing more than two types, one promoting the doctrines of Confucius and the other promoting the doctrines of Laozi and Zhuangzi, which were already harmful and useless to modern Chinese people. Qian Xuantong said that the future world will inevitably tend to adopt a unified language, such as Esperanto. He advocated that before Esperanto becomes popular, "starting from middle school, except for Chinese and the history and geography of the country, the rest of the subjects should all be read in the original Western texts." Similar extremely biased ideas were a reflection of the national nihilism of the petty bourgeoisie and were certainly wrong. But the entire movement was reasonable, and its vigorous development dealt a fatal blow to the feudal ideological system that had ruled China for two thousand years. This reactionary ideological system, which once enjoyed absolute authority, began to collapse entirely. People therefore more clearly recognized the necessity of learning scientific ideas from the West.

The authors of "New Youth" magazine admitted that all their attacks on feudalism from various aspects were aimed at consolidating the republican system. But it was precisely at this time that stubborn facts proved the bankruptcy of the republican system to people, making people doubt what kind of results its consolidation would be able to achieve. Even Chen Duxiu himself, despite his self-appointment as a defender of the republican system, could not give a powerful answer to this question. The fact that the republican regime was monopolized by warlords and politicians representing the interests of the big landlords and big bourgeoisie could not but make the national bourgeoisie and the petty bourgeoisie feel dissatisfied. Chen Duxiu and the remarks of many authors of "New Youth" magazine significantly reflected this sentiment. Chen Duxiu often talked about "party politics" in an extremely contemptuous tone, believing that it was a system not suitable for China, and he demanded a "national movement" like the American and French revolutions to transform China. But what was the goal of the so-called "national movement"? At that time, the best answer that Chen Duxiu could find was still the republican system. So Chen Duxiu had to fabricate a theory of "true republic," saying: "Today, no country's politics is far from being completely and truly republican. ... The republic has no end, and it is not that the republican politics will be completely achieved once a republican system is implemented." Such a republican system that would never be completely achieved was of course not satisfactory, because everyone could see that this was not an ideal, but a never-ending dispute. But precisely because the republican system was not satisfactory, it created conditions for the acceptance of socialist ideals.

III.

The history of the New Culture Movement on the eve of the May Fourth Movement proved a famous principle of Lenin, that is: "In a sense, the bourgeois revolution is more beneficial to the proletariat than to the bourgeoisie." Lenin pointed out that the bourgeois revolution is a revolution that eliminates the remnants of the old system throughout the country, that is, the remnants of serfdom, and most fully guarantees the broadest, freest, and fastest development of capitalism. But this revolution is very beneficial to the proletariat. Therefore, "the more complete, the more resolute, and the more thorough the bourgeois revolution is, the more guaranteed is the proletariat's struggle against the bourgeoisie for socialism." The history of the May Fourth Movement shows that the bourgeois revolution in the ideological field has the same significance for the proletariat. The more complete, the more resolute, and the more thorough this revolution is, the closer it is to the awakening of the proletariat. Conversely, if this revolution is incomplete, not resolute, and not thorough, and its scope is limited, it will definitely hinder or delay the awakening of the proletariat. In this sense, the comprehensive collapse of the Chinese feudal ideological system and the bankruptcy of the republican system are very beneficial developments for the Chinese proletariat.

That was indeed the case. Because of this development, the victory of the great October Socialist Revolution aroused a strong response among the Chinese people. Those who had ideologically completely broken with feudalism, who were disappointed with the republican system, and who were loyal patriots, gained new hope because of this great event in human history. They were willing to fight for the realization of a grand ideal, so that their motherland could be truly liberated.

Li Dazhao, a famous political commentator, was one of these loyal patriots. Before the October Revolution, Li Dazhao, like his contemporaries, believed that consolidating the republican system was the best way to transform China. He called for the awakening of Chinese national consciousness, demanding that young people bravely break with the old society and take on the great historical task of transforming China. But after the October Revolution, Li Dazhao immediately began to abandon bourgeois democracy and tend towards communism based on new understanding. In the speech "The Victory of the Common People" and the paper "The Victory of Bolshevism," Li Dazhao enthusiastically praised the great October Revolution, praised the revolutions in Germany, Hungary, Italy, and other countries at that time that broke out under the influence of the October Revolution, and believed that the future world was the world of the working class's communism, and the high tide of the European revolutionary movement had already foretold that this change was not far away. Li Dazhao pointed out that the victory of socialism was irresistible, and hailed that "the 1917 Russian Revolution was the prelude to the world revolution in the twentieth century," "look at the globe in the future, it must be a world of red flags."

What was particularly encouraging to the Chinese about the October Revolution was that once the power of an imperialist country that had actively carried out aggression in China was grasped by the workers, and the exploiters were eliminated, it automatically gave up all the privileges it had acquired abroad, and demonstrated with practical actions its consistency with the interests of the working class and oppressed nations around the world. This fact made the Chinese, even the bourgeois elements of China, understand a truth, that the liberation struggle of the oppressed nations can only achieve true victory when it is linked with the proletarian revolutionary movement. Before the October Revolution, people used to think that only in capitalist advanced countries could there be conditions for realizing socialism. The October Revolution broke this outdated concept and convinced people that the victory of socialism does not necessarily have to be in capitalist advanced countries, but may also be in countries with less developed capitalism. Therefore, for the people of backward countries to wait for the development of capitalism and wait for the conditions for revolution to mature is to prolong the life of reactionary rule and make themselves continue to endure the pain of being oppressed and exploited. Before the October Revolution, the bourgeois revolutionaries of China had for a long time not known where to find the revolutionary force, and the revolutionary force among the broad masses had not yet been united. The October Revolution greatly broadened people's horizons, and many people began to realize that labor is the real force of the revolution. Li Dazhao's paper reflected the attempt to rely on the mass movement to launch revolutionary struggle. Chen Duxiu denounced soldiers, bureaucrats, and politicians as three evils, and said that in order to eliminate them, the masses "must have considerable demonstrations." Labor became respected. Cai Yuanpei shouted "Labor is sacred." Some articles written by bourgeois elements even said that they wanted to "join the labor circles." Some newspapers and periodicals paid special attention to the reports of European workers' strikes, giving people the prelude to the revolutionary storm. But it cannot be considered that people's understanding at that time was very clear, and that they demanded immediate action. The bourgeois influence in people's minds at that time still existed in large quantities. After the end of the war, the general public believed that since "justice" had triumphed over power, China, as a participating country, could certainly be treated fairly at the peace conference that spoke of "justice," and could argue there to force foreign aggressors to automatically withdraw from China under the pressure of "justice." But what the Chinese got from the peace conference was disappointment. The peace conference rejected the demands put forward by the Chinese representatives and agreed that Japan should take over Germany's privileges in Shandong. After experiencing this great disappointment, people learned a lesson from the negative facts and began to realize the unreliability of the so-called "justice" and "righteousness" of capitalist countries. The democratic awareness that had been growing for many years and the revolutionary spirit inspired by the great October Socialist Revolution quickly spread. At this time, and only at this time, did people begin to truly realize that the liberation of the Chinese nation must rely on the "direct action" of the Chinese people themselves.

On May 4, 1919, Beijing students held a demonstration against Japanese aggression and traitors. The students were oppressed, but they received the support of public opinion. The movement continued to expand in the struggle against the oppression of the reactionaries. After the mass arrests in Beijing on June 3, a nationwide patriotic movement emerged. The first to support the Beijing students were the students and citizens of Shanghai. The students announced a strike, the merchants announced a market strike, and the workers successively announced a strike. The Shanghai storm immediately received a wide response throughout the country. Leaflets calling for riots appeared in Beijing. The expansion of the movement, especially the serious threat of workers' strikes, forced the reactionary government to yield to the revolutionary people within a week, removing the traitors from their government positions and releasing the arrested students. In order to perfunctorily blame public opinion and express responsibility for the reactionary measures, the president, prime minister, and all members of the cabinet announced their resignation. The Chinese representatives attending the peace conference in Paris also announced under the pressure of patriotic students that they would refuse to sign the Treaty of Versailles.

The May Fourth Movement greatly inspired the revolutionary masses, pointing out to them that the road to continued revolutionary struggle lay in the unity of the working class and the working people. Advanced people further understood the important significance of the great October Socialist Revolution, and clearly recognized that the new culture they wanted to introduce and the ideological weapons they wanted to borrow from the West were Marxism-Leninism. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out that "the May Fourth Movement occurred under the call of the world revolution at that time, under the call of the Russian revolution, and under the call of Lenin," precisely because this movement profoundly demonstrated the consistency of the national liberation struggle and the proletarian movement. The Chinese people's demand that their motherland become an independent country and gain equal status internationally does not require them to take a bourgeois nationalist stance in return and develop into an oppressor nation. Therefore, taking the road of Russia, thoroughly eliminating the exploiters, and building socialism is not only the common aspiration of the working class, but also of the working class and all loyal patriots. Because of this aspiration, the mainstream of the New Culture Movement after the May Fourth Movement was no longer a democratic movement, but a Marxist movement. Many newspapers and periodicals that supported the New Culture Movement made the introduction of Marxism and the Russian Revolution one of their main contents. Important works of Marxism and important documents of the Communist International and the Russian Communist Party began to have readable and complete translations. Among the broad masses of young people, the names of Marx and Engels, the founders of scientific socialism, and the name of Lenin, the leader of the October Revolution, became the most beloved names. People had infinite hope for the future of China, and the blossoming of thought was like a garden in spring. Of course, at this time, the Chinese Marxists were still immature, and were still in the process of transforming from democrats to Marxists, and their papers introducing Marxism often still had significant reflections of democratic ideas. However, this was not the main aspect. The main aspect was that they showed a great interest in Marxism-Leninism, a fervent pursuit of truth, and a deep hatred for China's reactionary rule.

Just as the emergence of all new forces inevitably encounters the suppression of reactionary forces, the Chinese Marxist movement was immediately subjected to all kinds of criticisms as soon as it began to form. The first to oppose the Marxist movement was Hu Shi. Hu Shi believed that China did not need Marxism, saying that it could not solve China's problems. In order to resist Marxism, Hu Shi put forward the slogan of "sorting out the national past." The next to oppose Marxism were Liang Qichao, Zhang Dongsun, and Zhang Junmai. They disguised themselves as supporters of socialism, saying that the future of the world belonged to socialism, which was an irresistible trend and beyond doubt, but China was a backward country and did not yet have the conditions to establish a Communist Party. To make China have this condition, the urgent task was not to establish a Communist Party, but to develop capitalism. The next to oppose Marxism was the anarchist party. The anarchist party advocated absolute individual freedom and opposed the establishment of a completely organized society, so they opposed the dictatorship of the proletariat, especially the establishment of a Marxist party that advocated the dictatorship of the proletariat. Chinese Marxists refuted the criticisms of these class enemies. Although they were not yet able to fully develop the fundamental theories of Marxism in the debate, they insisted on using Marxism to solve China's problems, insisting on establishing a Chinese Communist Party according to the example of the Russian Communist Party and realizing socialism through the dictatorship of the proletariat. After this series of debates, the Chinese Marxists completely broke with those bourgeois and petty bourgeois elements who had once cooperated to some extent in the New Culture Movement before the May Fourth Movement, but were actually enemies. They formed their own battlements and firmly embarked on the road of Marxism. Although many of them were not from the working class, they had infinite loyalty to the revolutionary cause, and they resolutely betrayed their class, transformed themselves according to the strict requirements of Marxism, and went directly to the workers to work, to the peasants to work, and strived to get close to the masses and become fighters of the working class. Because Chinese industry was underdeveloped, the working class was small in number, and on the other hand, because the number of revolutionaries from other classes was large, the road of self-transformation of intellectuals after the May Fourth Movement became the common road of the traditional Chinese revolutionary intellectuals dedicating themselves to the socialist cause.

The discussion among young Marxists about the establishment of the Chinese Communist Party was very enthusiastic. Two letters from Comrade Cai Hesen to Comrade Mao Zedong from Paris showed the magnificent ambitions of the Marxists under the influence of Comrade Mao Zedong for developing the Chinese revolutionary movement, the loyal trust in the Russian Communist Party and Lenin, and the firm attitude towards the dictatorship of the proletariat and the principles of internationalism. It is particularly worth pointing out that Comrade Cai Hesen expected Comrade Mao Zedong to become the leader of China's October Revolution. Comrade Mao Zedong was the leader and organizer of the mass struggle in Hunan during the May Fourth Movement. He carried out the most practical work among workers and students, preparing the strongest ideological and cadre conditions for the establishment of the Chinese Communist Party. Comrade Cai Hesen's expectations reflected the great historical significance of the activities Comrade Mao Zedong was engaged in. It was precisely on the basis of such active activities of the Chinese Marxists that the First National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party was held on July 1, 1921, announcing the establishment of the Chinese Communist Party.

IV.

The establishment of the Chinese Communist Party is the great achievement of the May Fourth Movement and the entire ideological movement of this period marked by the May Fourth Movement. Since the founding of the Chinese Communist Party, the face of the Chinese revolution has been completely new. This is the development that the reactionaries and some bourgeois elements in China are most unhappy with, and they therefore often deny the historical significance of the May Fourth Movement to varying degrees. Hu Shi only admitted that the May Fourth Movement was meaningful in terms of literary revolution. Hu Shi's view of the May Fourth Movement itself can explain that he was only related to the entire struggle at that time in advocating vernacular, and other than that, his entire ideological tendency was contrary to the May Fourth Movement. Jiang Jieshi's work "China's Destiny" also denies the May Fourth Movement because it introduced the free thought of the bourgeoisie and the communist thought of the proletariat. The former caused the destruction of the feudal ideological system, while the latter promoted China to embark on a new road of liberation struggle. The fact that both the reactionaries and bourgeois elements deny the May Fourth Movement very powerfully illustrates the fact that although the May Fourth Movement was initially a united front movement of three groups of people, namely the bourgeoisie, the petty bourgeoisie, and the communist intellectuals, only the Chinese working class and the Chinese Communist Party truly inherited and carried forward the traditions of the May Fourth Movement.

Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out that the May Fourth Movement also had shortcomings. At that time, many leading figures took a formalistic view of the status quo, history, and foreign affairs, believing that "what is so-called bad is absolutely bad, everything is bad; what is so-called good is absolutely good, everything is good." Chen Duxiu took this view of Chinese and Western culture, believing that Chinese culture was absolutely bad and Western culture was absolutely good, and that to preserve one must abolish the other. Hu Shi's formalistic view of Chinese and Western culture was the same as Chen Duxiu's, so he later formed his "complete Westernization theory." Hu Shi's view of literary revolution was also formalistic. He tried his best to limit the influence of the literary revolution to the scope of literary form reform. After the National Education Federation passed a resolution in 1919 to use Mandarin in primary school textbooks, he believed that the completion of the literary revolution was no longer a problem. This is a formalistic development to the right. The Chinese working class and the Chinese Communist Party inherited and carried forward the tradition of the May Fourth Movement, widely developed the revolutionary movement throughout the country, and created Mao Zedong Thought, which combines Marxism with the practice of the Chinese revolution. But as Comrade Mao Zedong said, "it is not consistent within the Communist Party. Some of them also have deviations. Marxism has not been firmly grasped, and they have committed formalistic errors, that is, subjectivism, sectarianism, and Party jargon, which is a formalistic development to the 'left'."

In the struggle against formalism, Comrade Mao Zedong correctly resolved the long-standing debate in the past century on the issue of Chinese and Western culture, that is, how to treat Western culture and ancient Chinese culture. Comrade Mao Zedong refuted the so-called "complete Westernization theory" of the Hu Shi faction, pointing out that our culture should be a culture with our national characteristics, which absorbs and develops with the world's progressive culture. China should absorb a large amount of foreign progressive culture, but it must never swallow it whole without criticism. Comrade Mao Zedong summed up the experience of opposing the development of formalism to the "left" and said, "Formalistic absorption of foreign things has caused great losses in China in the past. Chinese communists are the same with the application of Marxism in China. It is necessary to completely and appropriately unite the universal truth of Marxism with the specific practice of the Chinese revolution, that is to say, combine it with national characteristics and pass through a certain national form to be useful, and it must never be applied subjectively and formally. Formal Marxist, is only joking with Marxism and the Chinese revolution, there is no place for them in the Chinese revolutionary ranks. Chinese culture should have its own form, which is the national form. The national form, the content of the new democracy - this is our new culture today." Comrade Mao Zedong believed that we must take a critical attitude towards ancient Chinese culture as well. "To sort out the development process of ancient culture, to remove its feudal dross, and to absorb its democratic essence is a necessary condition for developing a new national culture and enhancing national self-confidence; but it must never be uncritical and all-inclusive. It is necessary to distinguish between all the corrupt things of the ancient feudal ruling class and the excellent people's culture of ancient times, which is somewhat democratic and revolutionary. The new politics and new economy of China at the present time have developed from the old politics and old economy of ancient times, and the new culture of China at the present time has also developed from the old culture of ancient times. Therefore, we must respect our own history and never cut off history. But this kind of respect is to give history a certain scientific position, to respect the dialectical development of history, not to praise the ancient and denigrate the present, and not to praise any feudal toxins." Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out that the new culture we want to create must serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and must draw strength from them in order to truly become a national, scientific, and mass culture.

This is the truth that has been verified by the long-term revolutionary struggle led by the Chinese working class since the May Fourth Movement. When this truth was announced by Comrade Mao Zedong, it fundamentally ended formalism and further armed the Chinese working class ideologically.

    论“五四”运动
    黎澍
    一
    1919年的五四运动是帝国主义侵入中国以后必然要发生的一次强大的爱国民主运动，是这个时期的整个思想运动的主要标志。帝国主义的侵略使中国成为半独立国家。中国在灭亡的恐怖下开始采取了资本主义生产方式。帝国主义在中国发了财，但是也替它自己造成了反对自己的革命势力。帝国主义在中国进行掠夺的过程，中国人民破产的过程，也正是中国革命分子成长和觉醒的过程。在鸦片战争以后最初几十年间，我们还只能看见中国农民和手工业者的朴素的反抗。在1894年中日战争以后，我们就逐渐看到以按照西方资本主义国家的面貌来改造中国的资产阶级运动了。戊戌变法是这个运动的自上而下的尝试，辛亥革命是这个运动的革命的爆发。但是作为中国革命的敌人的帝国主义和封建主义在辛亥革命当时没有明确地为多数人所认识。革命的锋芒不是直接指向这两个最主要的敌人，而是指向它们的工具——清朝政府。随着清朝政府的倾复而产生的共和国不是建立在革命胜利的基础上，而是建立在与帝国主义和封建主义妥协的基础上。共和国总统袁世凯的称帝和复古的活动很快就使得资产阶级特别是小资产阶级感觉到他们并没有从革命得到真正的利益。日本帝国主义在第一次世界大战初期以对德宣战为名进占山东全境的侵略行动引起了中国人民对于民族危机的严重的警惕。可是袁世凯却继续与日本勾结，企图依靠它的支持来登上皇帝的宝座。外国侵略和国内政治危机的继续发展，迫使人们不能不重新考虑中国民族的前途。于是一个新的解放运动——五四运动出现了。
    在五四运动以前，“新青年”（初名“青年”）杂志开始了一个反对孔子学说的猛烈的思想革命。这个思想革命被称为新文化运动，因为它要求在中国输入和普及民主思想和科学精神。这个运动是袁世凯称帝和号召尊孔复古在思想界引起的直接的反响。“新青年”的作者们认为，辛亥革命没有使中国社会的整个上层建筑经历根本性的变化，袁世凯称帝不是一个孤立的偶然的事件。在当时一般人里面，清朝的制度和习惯依然是办事的准则。政府官员满脑子君主时代旧思想，根本不懂得共和制度是什么。国会议员主张尊孔，要求规定孔教为国教。有许多革命党人丧失了革命的意志，被反动派同化了。有许多人自命为“新人物”，他们的思想实际上是陈腐的。在群众中，落后思想继续大量存在着。迷信没有破除。有不少人还相信满洲皇帝有“再坐龙廷”之日。这种现象的显著存在，说明辛亥革命在思想领域中和在政治领域中一样，是不彻底的。
    新文化运动是启蒙运动，是辛亥革命在思想领域中的继续。它的作用在于唤起人们的民主主义意识的觉醒，成为封建制度的自觉的反对者和共和制度的自觉的拥护者。辛亥革命前缺少这样一个彻底的思想运动，是中国民族资本薄弱和不发达的反映。辛亥革命以后出现这个运动，是大战期间中国民族资本有了发展的反映。中国民族资本的根本利益是与帝国主义相冲突的，所以这个运动虽然以反对封建主义而兴起，它的发展必然同时会要把革命的锋芒指向帝国主义。战后资本主义制度的没落和社会主义制度的胜利又必然会要使领导这个运动的一部分急进的民主主义者和爱国者把民族解放的希望寄托于与国际工人运动的联系，寄托于与伟大的工人国家苏联的联系，并使自己转变为社会主义者。所有这些发展都是完全合乎逻辑的，不可避免的。

    陈独秀在“新青年”创刊第一期发表的“敬告青年”一文首先提出一个中心思想，就是中国需要“改弦更张”，认为中国旧有文化和社会制度落后于欧洲几近千年，已经一文不值，甚至说，“吾宁忍过去国粹之消亡，而不忍现在及将来之民族不适世界之生存而归削灭也”。陈独秀号召青年从孔子教义的束缚中解放出来，成为独立自主的人，认识中国在世界的地位，以求实的进取的精神奋起自救。陈独秀认为中国要摆脱愚昧状态，“当以科学与人权并重”，建立有现代技术的农业和独立的现代工业，用科学知识破除迷信。“新青年”杂志发表了一系列的论文攻击孔子学说，把它当作妨碍中国人民觉醒的最大敌人。在
  “1916年”一文中，陈独秀认为“儒者三纲之说为一切道德政治之大原。君为臣纲，则民于君为附属品而无独立自主之人格矣；父为子纲，则子于父为附属品而无独立自主之人格矣；夫为妻纲，则妻于夫为附属品而无独立自主之人格矣。率天下之男女为臣为子为妻而不见有一独立自主之人者，三纲之说为之也。缘此而生金科玉律之道德名词，曰忠，曰孝，曰节，皆非推己及人之主人道德，而为以己属人之奴隶道德也。人间百行，皆以自我为中心，此而丧失，他何足言”。在“吾人最后之觉悟”一文中，陈独秀指出，封建主义的社会制度和共和制度是不相容的。“吾人果欲于政治上采用共和立宪制，复欲于伦理上保守纲常阶级制，以收新旧调和之效，自家冲撞，此绝对不可能之事。盖共和立宪制以独立、平等、自由为原则，与纲常阶级制为绝对不可相容之物，存其一必废其一。倘于政治否认专制，于家族社会仍保守旧有之特权，则法律上权利平等、经济上独立生产之原则破坏无余，焉有并行之余地。”这个思想又引伸为中国传统的旧文化和西方输入的新文化是不相容的，“新青年”的作者们要求用新文化代替旧文化，以便能够实现“建立西洋式之新国家，组织西洋式之新社会”的理想。这样，为了使新文化能够普遍地为人们所接受，就更加须要反对旧文化。著名的四川学者吴虞响应这个斗争，连续写了好几篇论文来揭露封建家族制度和封建道德的实质，对于维护封建制度和道德观点的孔子学说作了尖锐的攻击。中国现代文学的伟大导师鲁迅在他的第一个短篇小说“狂人日记”中发出了“礼教吃人”的惊呼，他控诉中国封建社会的人与人的关系仅仅是“吃与被吃”的关系。鲁迅的许多精美的杂文深深地击中了旧社会的弊害，他到处鞭挞着各种落后现象，热情地呼唤着新生力量的成长。
    “新青年”杂志对于封建主义的狂风暴雨的攻击使得整个思想界为之激动起来。它使得甚至根本反对革命的资产阶级分子也在一个时间里面卷进革命的风浪中来。胡适就是其中的一人。胡适在辛亥革命以前是通俗杂志的投稿者，当时正在美国留学。“新青年”影响了他，他提出了改革中国旧文学体裁的建议，反对模仿古人，主张改用白话。胡适建议的改革是反封建思想革命的必然要达到的发展。旧文学体裁是和它所反映的封建思想的内容分不开的。它已经在长时期停滞中僵化了，尽管其中还有不少可以吸收的东西，但是从整个来说，它已经没有生命力，既不足以表现现代生活，更不足以表达科学思想，在斗争深入的时候不可避免地要同封建思想一起受到攻击。胡适的建议显然是从“新青年”杂志关于统一语言和文字和创造统一民族语言的讨论引伸出来的，所以一经提出，就立即得到“新青年”的作者们的支持，并且进一步号召文学革命，要求建立国民的写实主义的社会文学或平民文学，从根本上抛弃流行的形式主义的旧文学。这个新的号召引起了思想界的更加广泛的震动，把斗争迅速引向高潮。从十八世纪以来成为正统文学的桐城派古文被称为“谬种”。著名语言学教授钱玄同发表了极端偏激的思想，反对读中国书籍，主张根本废除汉字。钱玄同认为中国的古典著作不外两种，一种是宣传孔子学说的，一种是宣传老子和庄子学说的，对于现代中国人，都已经是有害无益的了。钱玄同说，未来世界必然趋向于采用统一的语言，例如世界语。他主张在世界语通行以前，“从中学起，除国文及本国史地外，其余科目，悉读西文原书”。类似这样的极端偏激的思想是小资产阶级的民族虚无主义的反映，当然是错误的。但是整个运动是合理的，它的猛烈的发展使统治中国达二千年之久的封建主义思想体系遭到了致命的打击。这个曾经享有绝对权威的反动思想体系开始整个地崩溃下来了。人们因此更加清楚地认识了向西方学习科学思想的必要性。
      “新青年”杂志的作者们承认，所有他们从各方面对封建主义的攻击都是以巩固共和制度为目的的。但是也正是在这个时候，顽强的事实向人们证明着共和制度的破产，使人们不能不怀疑它的巩固究竟会能够达到什么样的成果。甚至陈独秀本人，尽管他以共和制度保卫者自任，也不能对这个问题作出有力的回答。共和国政权为代表大地主大资产阶级利益的军阀和政客所垄断，这不能不使民族资产阶级和小资产阶级感到不满。陈独秀和“新青年”杂志的许多作者的言论显著地反映了这种情绪。陈独秀往往用极端鄙薄的语调谈到“政党政治”，认为它是不适用于中国的制度，他要求有美国和法国革命时代的“国民运动”来改造中国。但是所谓“国民运动”所要达到的是什么呢？当时陈独秀所能找到的最好的回答还是共和制度。于是陈独秀只好杜撰出一个“真正共和”的理论，说：“今日无论何国政治，去完全真正共和尚远。……盖共和无止境，非一行共和政体，即共和政治完全告成者。”这样一种永远不会完全告成的共和制度当然是不能令人满意的，因为谁都看得到，这不是一个理想，而是一个永不中断的纷争。但是正因为共和制度不能令人满意，就为接受社会主义理想造成了条件。
    三
    五四运动前夕的新文化运动的历史证明了列宁的一个著名的原理，就是：“在某种意义上说来，资产阶级革命对于无产阶级，比对于资产阶级更加有利”。列宁指出，资产阶级革命是扫除全国旧制度残余，即农奴制残余，而最充分地保证资本主义最广阔、最自由和最迅速发展的革命。可是这个革命是对无产阶级十分有利的。因此，“资产阶级革命进行得愈完全，愈坚决，愈彻底，无产阶级反对资产阶级而争取社会主义的斗争，也就愈有保证”。五四运动的历史表明思想领域中的资产阶级革命对无产阶级具有相同的意义，这个革命进行得愈完全，愈坚决，愈彻底，也就愈接近于无产阶级的觉醒。反过来，如果这个革命是不完全的，不坚决的，不彻底的，它的范围是有限的，就一定要妨碍或者延缓无产阶级的觉醒。在这个意义上，中国封建主义思想体系的全面的崩溃，共和制度的破产，是对中国无产阶级非常有利的发展。
    事实正是如此。由于有了这个发展，伟大的十月社会主义革命的胜利在中国人民中引起了强烈的反响。那些在思想上彻底同封建主义决裂了的、对共和制度感到失望的、忠实的爱国者，因为这个人类历史的伟大事件的发生而获得了新的希望。他们愿意为实现一个宏伟的理想进行斗争，使自己的祖国得到真正的解放。
    著名政论家李大钊就是这些忠实的爱国者中的一个。在十月革命以前，李大钊和他的同时代人一样，认为巩固共和制度是改造中国的最好的途径。他呼唤着中国民族意识的觉醒，要求青年人勇敢地同旧社会决裂，担负起改造中国的伟大历史任务。但是在十月革命以后，李大钊根据新的认识，立即开始抛弃资产阶级民主主义，而倾向于共产主义。在演说“庶民的胜利”和论文“布尔什维主义的胜利”中，李大钊热情地歌颂了伟大的十月革命，歌颂了在十月革命影响下爆发的德国、匈牙利、意大利以及当时其他国家的革命，认为未来世界是工人阶级的共产主义的世界，欧洲革命运动的高涨已经预告这个变化的到来将不是遥远的事情。李大钊指出，社会主义的胜利是不可抗拒的，欢呼“1917年的俄国革命是二十世纪中世界革命的先声”，“试看将来的环球，必是赤旗的世界”。
    十月革命特别使中国人感到鼓舞的是，一个曾经在中国积极进行侵略的帝国主义国家，一旦政权为工人所掌握，消灭了剥削者，就自动放弃它在国外取得的一切特权，用实际行动表现了它同全世界工人阶级和被压迫民族的利益的一致。这个事实使中国人，甚至中国的资产阶级分子，懂得了一个道理，就是被压迫民族的解放斗争只有同无产阶级革命运动联系起来，才能得到真正的胜利。在十月革命以前，人们曾经认为只有在资本主义先进国家才有实现社会主义的条件。十月革命打破了这个陈腐的观念，使人们确信社会主义的胜利并不一定是在资本主义先进国家，也可能是在资本主义较少发达的国家。因此，落后国家的人民等待资本主义的发展，等待革命条件的成熟，那就是延长反动统治的寿命，使自己继续忍受被压迫和被剥削的痛苦。在十月革命以前，中国的资产阶级革命者曾经长时期不知道到哪里去寻找革命的力量，而广大的群众中的革命力量也还没有团结起来。十月革命大大开拓了人们的眼界，有许多人开始认识劳工是革命的真正力量。李大钊的论文反映了对于依靠群众运动展开革命斗争的企图。陈独秀指斥军人、官僚、政客为三害，并且说，为了消灭他们，群众“要有相当的示威运动”。劳工成为被尊敬的人。蔡元培喊“劳工神圣”。有些资产阶级分子写的文章甚至说要“加入劳动界”。有些报刊特别注意欧洲工人罢工的报道，给人们以革命暴风雨的预告。但是不能认为人们的认识在当时就是很明确的，并且要求立即采取行动。当时人们思想中的资产阶级影响还大量存在。一般人在大战结束以后，认为“公理”既然战胜了强权，中国作为参战国，当然也可以在讲“公理”的和平会议上得到公平的待遇，可以在那里据理力争，使外国侵略者在“正义”的压迫下自动退出中国。可是中国人从和平会议得到的是失望。和平会议拒绝中国代表提出的要求，并且同意日本接管德国在山东的特权。在经历了这次大失望以后，人们从反面事实得到了教训，开始认识资本主义国家所谓“公理”和“正义”的不可靠。多年来不断增长着的民主主义觉悟和为伟大的十月社会主义革命所鼓舞起来的革命精神很快扩展开来。这时，也只有在这时，人才开始真正体会到，中国民族的解放一定要依靠中国人民自己的“直接行动”。
    1919年5月4日，北京学生举行了反对日本侵略和卖国贼的示威。学生遭到了压迫，但是他们得到了舆论的支持。运动在反对反动派压迫的斗争中不断地扩大。在6月3日北京大逮捕以后，出现了全国规模的爱国运动。首先起来支援北京学生的是上海的学生和市民，学生宣布罢课，商人宣布罢市，工人继起宣布罢工。上海的风潮立即在全国各地得到了广泛的呼应。北京出现了号召暴动的传单。运动的扩大，特别是工人罢工的严重威胁，不出一星期便迫使反动政府屈服在革命人民的面前，免除了卖国贼的政府职务，释放了被捕学生。为了敷衍舆论的责难，表示对反动措施负责，总统、总理和内阁的全体成员宣布辞职。在巴黎出席和平会议的中国代表也在爱国的留学生压迫下宣布拒绝在对德和约上签字。
    五四运动极大地鼓舞了革命的群众，给他们指出了继续革命斗争的道路在于工人阶级和劳动人民的团结。先进的人们进一步领会了伟大的十月社会主义革命的重要意义，明确地认识到他们要输入的新文化，要从西方借取的思想武器，就是马克思列宁主义。毛泽东同志指出，“五四运动是在当时世界革命号召之下，是在俄国革命号召之下，是在列宁号召之下发生的”，正是因为这个运动深刻地表现了民族解放斗争和无产阶级运动的一致性。中国人民要求自己的祖国成为独立的国家，在国际上得到平等地位，并不需要反过来采取资产阶级民族主义立场，发展成为压迫民族，因此，走俄国的路，彻底消灭剥削者，建设社会主义，便不仅是工人阶级的，并且也是工人阶级和一切忠实爱国者的共同愿望。由于这个愿望，新文化运动的主流在五四运动以后，已不再是民主主义运动，而是马克思主义运动。有许多拥护新文化运动的报刊都以介绍马克思主义和俄国革命为主要内容之一。马克思主义的重要著作，共产国际和俄国共产党的重要文件，开始有了可读的完备的译本。在广大的青年群众中，科学社会主义创始人马克思和恩格斯的名字，十月革命领袖列宁的名字，成为最受爱戴的名字。人们对于中国的未来怀抱着无穷的希望，思想的焕发，有如春天的花园。当然，这时中国马克思主义者还是幼稚的，还处在由民主主义者向马克思主义者转变的过程中，在他们的介绍马克思主义的论文中往往还有着民主主义思想的显著的反映。然而这不是主要的方面，主要的方面是他们表现了对于马克思列宁主义的巨大的兴趣，对于真理的热烈的追求，以及对于中国反动统治的深刻的憎恶。
    正如一切新生力量的出现必然要遭到反动势力的压抑一样，中国马克思主义运动刚一开始形成便立即遭到了各式各样的非难。首先起来反对马克思主义运动的是胡适。胡适认为中国不需要马克思主义，说它不能解决中国问题。为了抵制马克思主义，胡适提出了“整理国故”的口号。继起反对马克思主义的是梁启超、张东荪和张君励。他们把自己伪装为社会主义的拥护者，说世界的未来属于社会主义是大势所趋、不容置疑的了，但是中国是落后国家，还没有建立共产党的条件。要使中国具备这个条件，当务之急不是建立共产党，而是发展资本主义。接着起来反对马克思主义的是无政府党。无政府党主张个人的绝对自由，反对建立一个完全有组织的社会，所以他们反对无产阶级专政，特别是反对建立一个主张无产阶级专政的马克思主义政党。中国马克思主义者驳斥了这些阶级敌人的非难。尽管他们在论争中还没有能够充分发挥马克思主义的根本理论，但是他们坚持了用马克思主义解决中国问题的立场，坚持了按照俄国共产党的榜样建立中国共产党和经过无产阶级专政实现社会主义的路线。经过这一系列的争论，中国马克思主义者同那些曾经在五四运动以前的新文化运动中实行过某种程度的合作然而实际上是敌人的资产阶级和小资产阶级分子完全决裂了。他们形成了自己的壁垒，坚定地走上了马克思主义的道路。尽管他们中间有许多人不是工人阶级出身的，但是他们有对革命事业的无限忠诚，他们坚决地背叛了自己的阶级，按照马克思主义的严格要求改造自己，直接到工人中去做工作，到农民中去做工作，力求使自己接近群众，成为工人阶级的战士。由于中国工业不发达，工人阶级数量很小，而另一方面，由于出身其他阶级的革命者的数量很大，五四运动以后知识分子自我改造的道路便成为中国革命知识分子献身社会主义事业的传统的共同道路。
  在青年马克思主义者中进行的关于建立中国共产党的讨论曾经是非常热烈的。蔡和森同志由巴黎寄给毛泽东同志的两封信表现了在毛泽东同志影响下的马克思主义者对于发展中国革命运动的宏伟的抱负，对于俄国共产党和列宁的忠诚的信赖，对于无产阶级专政和国际主义原则的坚定的态度。特别值得指出的是，蔡和森同志期望毛泽东同志成为中国的十月革命的领导者。毛泽东同志是五四运动时期湖南群众斗争的领导者和组织者。他在工人和学生中进行着最切实的工作，为中国共产党的成立准备了最坚强的思想的和干部的条件。蔡和森同志的期望反映了毛泽东同志所从事的活动的重大历史意义。正是在中国马克思主义者的这样的积极活动的基础上，在1921年7月1日举行了中国共产党第一次全国代表大会，宣告了中国共产党的成立。
    四
    中国共产党的成立是五四运动和以五四运动为标志的整个这一时期
  的思想运动的伟大的成果。自从有了中国共产党，中国革命的面貌就焕
  然一新。这是中国的反动派和某些资产阶级分子所最不快意的发展，他
  们因此也就往往在不同的程度上否认五四运动的历史意义。胡适仅仅在
  文学革命这一点上承认五四运动是有意义的。胡适对五四运动的看法本
  身可以说明他同当时整个斗争仅在主张白话一点上有关系，除此以外，他
  的整个思想倾向都是与五四运动相反的。蒋介石著作的“中国之命运”同
  样否定五四运动，因为它引进了资产阶级的自由思想和无产阶级的共产
  主义思想，前者引起了封建主义思想体系的破坏，而后者推动中国走上
  了新的解放斗争的道路。反动派和资产阶级分子都否定五四运动，非常
  有力地说明了一个事实，就是五四运动虽然最初是资产阶级、小资产阶
  级和共产主义知识分子三部分人的统一战线的运动，但是真正继承和发
  扬五四运动传统的只有中国工人阶级和中国共产党。
      毛泽东同志指出，五四运动也是有缺点的，那时许多领导人物对于
  现状，对于历史，对于外国事物，采取了形式主义观点，认为“所谓坏
  就是绝对的坏，一切皆坏；所谓好就是绝对的好，一切皆好。”陈独秀对中国和西方文化就是采取这种观点，认为中国文化绝对坏，西方文化
  绝对好，存其一必废其一。胡适对中国和西方文化的形式主义观点与陈
  独秀相同，所以他在后来形成了他的“全盘西化论”。胡适对文学革命
  的观点也是形式主义的。他极力要把文学革命的影响限制在文学形式改革的范围以内。到1919年全国教育联合会通过小学教科书改用国语的决议以后，就认为文学革命的完成已经不成问题了。这是形式主义向右的发展。中国工人阶级和中国共产党继承和发扬五四运动的传统，在全国范围广泛地发展了革命运动，创造了马克思主义与中国革命实际相结合的毛泽东思想，但是也正如毛泽东同志所说，“在共产党内也不是一致的，其中也有一部分人发生偏向，马克思主义没有拿得稳，犯了形式主义的错误，这就是主观主义、宗派主义和党八股，这是形式主义向‘左’的发展”。
    在反对形式主义的斗争中，毛泽东同志正确地解决了近百年来长期争论的中西文化问题，即如何对待西方文化和中国古代文化问题。毛泽东同志驳斥了胡适派所谓“全盘西化论”，指出我们的文化应当是具有我们民族特点的文化，它与世界进步文化是互相吸收和互相发展的。中国应当大量吸收外国的进步文化，但是决不能生吞活剥，毫无批判。毛泽东同志总结反对形式主义向“左”的发展的经验说，“形式主义地吸收外国的东西，在中国过去是吃过大亏的。中国共产主义者对于马克思主义在中国的应用也是这样，必须将马克思主义的普遍真理和中国革命的具体实践完全地恰当地统一起来，就是说，和民族的特点相结合，经过一定的民族形式，才有用处，决不能主观地公式地应用它。公式的马克思主义者，只是对于马克思主义和中国革命开玩笑，在中国革命队伍中是没有他们的位置的。中国文化应有自己的形式，这就是民族形式。民族的形式，新民主主义的内容——这就是我们今天的新文化。”毛泽东同志认为对待中国古代文化同样必须采取批判的态度。“清理古代文化的发展过程，剔除其封建性的糟粕，吸收其民主性的精华，是发展民族新文化提高民族自信心的必要条件；但是决不能无批判地兼收并蓄。必须将古代封建统治阶级的一切腐朽的东西和古代优秀的人民文化即多少带有民主性和革命性的东西区别开来。中国现时的新政治新经济是从古代的旧政治旧经济发展而来的，中国现时的新文化也是从古代的旧文化发展而来，因此，我们必须尊重自己的历史，决不能割断历史。但是这种尊重，是给历史以一定的科学的地位，是尊重历史的辩证法的发展，而不是颂古非今，不是赞扬任何封建的毒素。”毛泽东同志指出，我们所要创造的新文化必须是为工农群众服务的，必须从他们吸取力量，才能真正成为民族的、科学的、大众的文化。
    这是为五四运动以来中国工人阶级领导的长期革命斗争所证实的真理。当这个真理由毛泽东同志宣布出来的时候，就从根本上结束了形式主义，在思想上进一步武装了中国工人阶级。
