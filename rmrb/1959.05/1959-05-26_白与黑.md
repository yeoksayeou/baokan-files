    White and Black
    Chi Bei'ou
    American newspapers report: A children's book titled "The Rabbit's Wedding," which tells the story of a white rabbit marrying a black rabbit, has recently been banned from some public libraries in Alabama, USA, on the grounds that it "may have anti-segregation motives."

          White horses are superior to black horses,
          Black pigs are inferior to white pigs;
          White lambs should discriminate against black lambs,
          Black mice must be segregated from white mice.
          How can a white rabbit marry a black rabbit?
          It's simply intolerable.
          Such a children's book must be banned,
          Because it insults the noble white people.
          In order to instill racism in the next generation,
          The author should write more stories like these:
          How white dogs lynch black dogs,
          How black cats are casually bitten to death by white cats.
          It seems that American laws will sooner or later be revised,
          Stipulating that when saying "black," one is not allowed to say "white,"
          Black characters are forbidden from being printed on white paper,
          And milk is not allowed to be mixed into coffee.

    白与黑
    池北偶
    美国报纸载称：一本描写一只白兔和一只黑兔结婚的故事的名为“兔子结婚”的小人书，最近在美国亚拉巴马州的一些公立图书馆中被查禁，理由是：它“可能有反对种族隔离的动机”。
          白马比黑马优越，
          黑猪比白猪低劣；
          白羊羔应当歧视黑羊羔，
          黑耗子必须同白耗子隔绝。
          白兔怎能和黑兔通婚？
          简直是叫人不能容忍。
          这样的小人书一定要查禁，
          因为它侮辱了尊贵的白人。
          为了向下一代灌输种族主义，
          作者应当多写这样的一些故事：
          白狗怎样对黑狗采用私刑，
          黑猫怎样被白猫随便咬死。
          看来美国的法律迟早会有所修改，
          规定说“黑”的时候不许说“白”，
          白纸上禁止印黑字，
          咖啡里不准掺牛奶。
