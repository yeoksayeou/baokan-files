　　It's Better to Keep the "Orchestra" on the Side of the Stage
　　Recently, I traveled to some places and, in my spare time, watched a few local operas. They were truly unique and exciting. However, I noticed that some troupes, for some reason, moved the orchestra (commonly known as the "changmian") from the side of the stage to below the stage, between the audience seating and the stage. This felt very strange. When I talked about this with some comrades, everyone guessed that it might be influenced by European opera and our new opera performances. We feel that the orchestra used in traditional Chinese opera is different from the symphony orchestra used in traditional European opera. The roles they play in their respective performances are also different. We don't need to follow the style of others.

　　As everyone knows, the orchestra in opera is led by the drummer. Although the musical patterns are fixed, over the long term, due to the continuous processing and creation of singing styles by many outstanding artists, there are often impromptu performances. In such cases, the accompaniment needs to coordinate with the actors' performances and adapt accordingly to achieve a better effect. Therefore, each performer has a very close connection with the actor's singing. At the same time, although the accompanying orchestra usually consists of only five to seven people, and now sometimes up to a dozen, it is complete with strings, winds, and percussion instruments. In particular, the sound of the percussion is strong. Accompaniment on the side of the stage will not hinder the audience from appreciating the singer's voice. However, the orchestra of traditional European opera is usually a large symphony orchestra with dozens of players and multiple parts. The singer's singing is not just solo, but also includes duets, choruses, and other forms. It has a fixed score, and both the actors and the musicians must sing and play according to this score, without individual improvisation. Thus, there must be a conductor to organize the diverse forms of singing on stage and the complex musical performances of the orchestra into a harmonious whole. To facilitate unified command, their habit is to place the orchestra in a specially designed orchestra pit in front and below the stage. This is also handled according to their specific circumstances.

　　From the above, in order to better complement the singer's voice, to avoid the accompaniment music being too loud, the singer having to strain their voice and the audience still not being able to hear, and to prevent the strong sound of the orchestra from irritating the audience's ears, it is better to keep the opera orchestra on the side of the stage as before.　Reader　Ye Fan

### “场面”还是放在台侧的好

    “场面”还是放在台侧的好
    最近，我出差到一些地方，工余看了几次地方戏，真是各有特色，令人兴奋。但是，我看见有的剧团演出时，不晓得为什么把乐队（俗称“场面”）从台侧移到台下，放在观众座席和舞台之间了。这真使人感到很不习惯。和有的同志谈起这件事，大家猜想可能是受了欧洲歌剧和我们新歌剧演出的影响。我们觉得，中国传统戏曲所使用的乐队和欧洲传统歌剧所使用的交响乐队不同，二者在各自的演出中所起的作用也不一样，我们没有必要按照人家的样式来搞。
    大家都知道，戏曲乐队伴奏的时候是由那个司鼓的人来领头的，伴奏的曲牌虽也是固定的，但长期以来，由于许多杰出艺人在唱腔上的不断加工和创造，常常有即兴的发挥，遇到这种情况，伴奏就需要配合演员的表演随机应变，使演唱获得更好的效果。所以，每一个演奏的人和演员的歌唱有着非常紧密的联系。同时，虽然这个伴奏的乐队一般的只是五、七人，现在有的增多至十几人，由于弦、管、打击乐器俱全，特别是打击乐的音响强烈，在台侧伴奏，不会妨碍观众欣尝演员的歌喉。而欧洲传统歌剧的乐队，通常是一个有几十人、多声部的大型交响乐队。演员的歌唱也不仅仅是独唱，还有重唱、合唱等多种形式。它有一个固定的乐谱，演员和演奏员都必须按照这个乐谱来演唱和演奏，不能个人即兴发挥。这样，就必须有一个指挥的人，把台上多样形式的演唱，和乐队多声部复杂的音乐演奏组织起来，成为一个和谐的整体。为了便于统一指挥，他们的习惯是把乐队放在台前下方专门设置的乐池里，这也是根据他们的具体情况来处理的。
    从上面所说的情况来看，为了更好地衬托演员的歌唱，不致因为伴奏音乐的音量太强，演员唱得声嘶力竭观众还听不见，更不因为乐队的强烈音响刺激观众的听觉产生反感，戏曲乐队还是按老样子放在台侧的好。　读者　叶凡
