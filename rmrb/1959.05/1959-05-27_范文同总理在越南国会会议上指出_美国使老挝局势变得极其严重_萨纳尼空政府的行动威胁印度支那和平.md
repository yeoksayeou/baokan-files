Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, May 26th: Premier Pham Van Dong of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam delivered a report on the current domestic and international situation at the tenth session of the Vietnamese National Assembly today. In his report, Premier Pham Van Dong pointed out, "U.S. imperialism has made the situation in Laos extremely serious."

Pham Van Dong said: "At the instigation of U.S. imperialism, the Phoui Sananikone government blatantly violated the Geneva Agreements on Laos, prevented the International Commission from continuing its activities in Laos, discriminated against and suppressed former Pathet Lao resistance personnel, repeatedly violated the airspace of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, and increased troop deployments (including former Tai puppet troops) to harass the Vietnamese border. It also allowed the South Vietnamese authorities to use Laos as a base for conducting espionage activities against North Vietnam, creating tension along the Vietnamese-Laotian border, especially in the Xiang Lap region. Recently, the Phoui Sananikone government has used force to demand the surrender and disarmament of former Pathet Lao combat forces, surrounded the residences of leaders of the Lao Patriotic Front (including Prince Souphanouvong, chairman of the Lao Patriotic Party), persecuted local cadres of the Patriotic Party, and completely abandoned the agreement signed between the Kingdom of Laos and the former Pathet Lao combat forces."

Pham Van Dong said: "The actions of the Phoui Sananikone government also completely violate the joint statement signed on August 29, 1956, by the delegation of the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the delegation of the Royal Lao Government, headed by Prince Souvanna Phouma, which was visiting Vietnam at the time."

He said: "The actions of the Phoui Sananikone government have created an extremely serious situation in Laos, creating a crisis of renewed war, creating tension in the Vietnamese-Laotian border area, and threatening peace in Indochina. These actions are aimed at realizing the U.S. imperialist attempt to drag Laos into the Southeast Asia aggressive bloc, turn Laos into a U.S. military base, and directly threatening the tranquility of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. The Phoui Sananikone government must bear all responsibility for the consequences of its actions."

In his report, Premier Pham Van Dong also sternly condemned the South Vietnamese authorities for forcing their "National Assembly" to pass "Ordinance No. 10 of 1959." He said: "These murderers who created the Phu Loi massacre and many other massacres have blatantly trampled on humanity and justice, and attempted to create a climate of terror among people of all strata. However, the South Vietnamese people will never be intimidated by them. On the contrary, the South Vietnamese people will unite more closely and vigorously wage a struggle to win the right to live, to win democratic freedoms, and to win national independence and peaceful reunification of the fatherland."

Speaking of the Tibetan rebellion, Premier Pham Van Dong said: "The Vietnamese people warmly welcome the Chinese people and government's rapid and thorough suppression of the Tibetan counter-revolutionary rebel group. This victory enables the Tibetan people to get rid of serfdom earlier and realize the democratic reforms they eagerly desire. The Vietnamese people believe that Tibet is Chinese territory and the Tibetan question is China's internal affair, and no country has the right to interfere."

Referring to the Foreign Ministers' Conference currently being held in Geneva, Premier Pham Van Dong said: "The Vietnamese people and the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam fully support the Soviet government's position at this conference." He said: "We support the delegation of the Government of the German Democratic Republic to attend the Geneva conference for negotiations, and believe that representatives of the People's Republic of Poland and the Czechoslovak Republic have full rights to participate in this conference." He said: "The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam believes that the actions of U.S. imperialism and Western countries to obstruct the smooth progress of the conference must be stopped."

Speaking of the agricultural cooperation movement in North Vietnam, Premier Pham Van Dong said: Agricultural cooperation is the main link in the entire socialist transformation of North Vietnam, and agricultural cooperation has a huge and profound effect on the political, economic, cultural and other aspects of life in North Vietnam. Agricultural cooperation will further consolidate the foundation of the people's democratic state—the worker-peasant alliance—and further consolidate the national united front of North Vietnam. Premier Pham Van Dong said that because of all this, agricultural cooperation will enhance the strength of North Vietnam, making North Vietnam a solid foundation for the struggle for national reunification.

    范文同总理在越南国会会议上指出
    美国使老挝局势变得极其严重
    萨纳尼空政府的行动威胁印度支那和平
    据新华社河内26日电  越南民主共和国总理范文同今天在越南国会第十次会议上作了关于当前国内外形势的报告。范文同总理在报告中指出，“美帝国主义已经使老挝局势变得极其严重”。
    范文同说：“在美帝国主义的唆使下，培·萨纳尼空政府明目张胆地违反关于老挝的日内瓦协议，不让国际委员会继续在老挝活动，歧视和镇压前老挝抗战人员，多次侵犯越南民主共和国领空，增调军队（包括前傣族伪军），来骚扰越南边境，并且让南越当局利用老挝作根据地，向北越进行特务活动，在沿越老边境线上，特别是在向立地区制造紧张局势。最近，培·萨纳尼空政府又使用武力要前寮国战斗部队投降和缴械，包围老挝爱国阵线领袖们的住宅（其中有老挝爱国党主席苏发努冯亲王），迫害爱国党的地方干部，完全废弃了老挝王国和前寮国战斗部队之间所签订的协议。”
    范文同说：“培·萨纳尼空政府的行动，也完全违背了1956年8月29日越南民主共和国政府代表团和当时访问越南的以梭发那·富马亲王为首的老挝王国政府代表团所签订的联合声明。”
    他说：“培·萨纳尼空政府的行动，在老挝造成了一种极其严重的局势，造成了战争重演的危机，造成了越南—老挝边界地区的紧张局势，威胁着印度支那的和平。这些行动旨在实现美帝国主义企图把老挝拉入东南亚侵略集团、把老挝变成美国军事基地、直接威胁越南民主共和国的安宁的阴谋。培·萨纳尼空政府必须对它的行动所造成的后果负全部责任。”
    范文同总理在报告中还严斥南越当局强迫他的“国会”通过“1959年第十号法令”。他说：“这些制造富利惨案和其他许多屠杀事件的凶手们明目张胆地蹂躏了人道和公理，并且企图在各阶层人民中制造恐怖心理。可是，南越人民绝不会给他们吓倒，相反，南越人民将更加紧密地团结起来，大力地进行斗争以争取生活的权利，争取民主自由权，争取民族独立和和平统一祖国。”
    范文同总理在谈到西藏叛乱问题时说：“越南人民热烈欢迎中国人民和政府迅速、彻底地平息西藏反革命叛乱集团。这个胜利使西藏人民能够更早地摆脱农奴制度，实现他们所热切盼望的民主改革。越南人民认为西藏是中国的领土，西藏问题是中国的内政问题，任何国家都无权干涉。”
    谈到正在日内瓦举行的外长会议时，范文同总理说：“越南人民和越南民主共和国政府完全支持苏联政府在这次会议上的立场”。他说：“我们支持德意志民主共和国政府代表团出席日内瓦会议谈判，并且认为波兰人民共和国和捷克斯洛伐克共和国的代表都有充分的权利参加这次会议”。他说：“越南民主共和国政府认为美帝国主义和西方各国阻挠会议顺利进行的行动必须停止”。
    在谈到越南北方的农业合作化问题时，范文同总理说：农业合作化是越南北方全部社会主义改造事业中的主要环节，农业合作化对越南北方的政治、经济、文化等方面的生活有巨大和深刻的作用。农业合作化将进一步巩固人民民主国家的基础——工农联盟，进一步巩固越南北方的民族统一战线。范文同总理说，由于这一切，农业合作化将增强越南北方的力量，使越南北方成为争取祖国统一的稳固基础。
