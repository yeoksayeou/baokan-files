    Articles Should Be Colloquial
    Pu Wei
    Some people speak clearly and understandably in ordinary conversation, sounding very natural. Sometimes, they even say witty things, which are quite humorous. However, as soon as they start writing, their tone changes. Sentences become long and drawn out, words are used stiffly, making them unclear, incomprehensible, and certainly not humorous. Reading such articles is a real disaster. In fact, the purpose of both writing and speaking is to express one's meaning, and the clearer and more understandable the expression, the better. Articles should be written as plainly as if they were spoken, and should never be more difficult to understand than a speech. If there is any difference between an article and ordinary conversation, it is only that the article is more accurate, more thorough, more concise, and more organized. To use an analogy, ordinary conversation is like a roughcast, and writing an article is like processing that roughcast. But first, the roughcast cannot be discarded, and second, the processing cannot lose the original shape.
    Some people will say, "Colloquial language is not suitable for formal occasions, cannot be used in serious articles, and even less so in official documents." This statement is a bit unserious. Please take a look at our Ministry of National Defense's "Message to Compatriots in Taiwan" from October 6th last year. And the "Second Message to Compatriots in Taiwan" on October 25th, which contained a lot of colloquial language. Like "American masters," "meddling in other people's affairs," and that imperialist elements "have no conscience," "I advise you to be careful," "Thank God, our country was seen by an American master," "We are all Chinese," "Firing some cannons to get your attention." Aren't these things we often say? Why is it that using these words in such important proclamations doesn't feel the slightest bit unserious, but other articles can't use them?
    Some people's writing doesn't strive for colloquialization, but simply for incomprehensibility. Many words in their articles are not their own; some sound like lines from Peking Opera, others like poorly translated movie dialogue. It makes people want to laugh. This, it should be said, is truly unserious! Being alive, yet not using living language; being modern people, yet not using modern words! Insisting on being "semi-classical, semi-modern" is really something to be ashamed of, yet some people are used to it and don't find it strange.
    "Does colloquialization mean that complex ideas cannot be expressed?" This depends on how you look at it. The masses of the people speak every day, and they are not all simple-minded. In terms of vocabulary, colloquialization does not mean rejecting scientific terms, but rather combining colloquial language with scientific terms. There are many new words and new terms among the masses. "People's Commune," "Tool Reform," "Increase Labor Productivity," "Technical Revolution," "Great Leap Forward," "Walking on Two Legs," "Nine Fingers and One Finger," countless new words have already taken root among the masses. We cannot look at the language of the masses with the eyes of gentlemen, thinking that their speech is all vulgar and simple. The best words, the most incisive words, often come from the masses.
    Now there are some people who don't know how to speak the language of the masses and deliberately use profundity to cover up their inadequacy. Let's take an example. For example, someone says, "Comrade tricycle worker, if you can transport me to that destination, the train station, within a quarter of an hour, then I will pay you twice the price that is currently due." These sentences are very much in line with the logical "hypothetical judgment," and are also very precise and thorough, but they are too foreign. The tricycle worker would think he was a bit crazy. In ordinary speech, it would be: "Comrade, pedal faster, get to the station in fifteen minutes, and I'll double the fare." Wouldn't that make the meaning clear? Why must you deliberately be profound? Of course, this example is made up; no one really speaks like that. However, when writing articles, there really are people who write like that. If you say he's wrong, he won't be convinced, his face will turn red, and his neck will get thick, replying: "It wouldn't be accurate otherwise!" In fact, colloquialization doesn't oppose new words, nor does it oppose new syntax. There's just one point: it cannot be separated from the masses, and it cannot be separated from the language habits of the Chinese people.
    "Can classical Chinese not be used at all?" This depends on whether the classical Chinese you use is still alive in the language of the masses. "How can this be?" is classical Chinese, which the masses still often use. "Extremely deceitful" and "Truth will come out" are also classical Chinese, which the masses also don't abandon. However, don't move a lot of old antiques without considering the audience, and don't write things that are easy to read in a way that is only suitable for reading but not for reciting, like classical Chinese. For example, don't write "at the time of something" as "at something time," or write "but" as "but," or write "and" or "moreover" as "and." That's not colloquialization. Colloquialization should always be easy to recite, and similar to ordinary speech.
    To achieve colloquialization in articles, we must do two things well. First, we must understand the issue thoroughly. If we don't really understand the issue ourselves and don't have a real understanding of it, it will be difficult to write an article that is like ordinary speech. Second, we must be familiar with the masses, familiar with their way of thinking, familiar with their way of discussing issues, familiar with their tone, and familiar with their commonly used vocabulary. Only in this way can we naturally write articles according to the language habits of the masses and gradually get rid of the "student style." Therefore, to achieve colloquialization in articles, we cannot simply focus on writing techniques, but more importantly, we must go deep into reality, go deep among the masses, thoroughly understand what we want to write and what we want to say, so that we can write clear and understandable colloquial articles in a simple and profound way.

    文章应该口语化
    浦薇
    有的人，平常说话倒清清楚楚明明白白，听起来很自然；有时候，还说句把俏皮话，也很有风趣；可是，一到写起文章来，腔调就变了，句子拉得老长，词儿用得生硬，看起来既不清楚，又不明白，更谈不到风趣。看这种文章真是一种灾难。其实，写文章和讲话的目的都是为了表达自己的意思，应该是越表达得清楚、明白越好。文章应该写得明白如话，决不应该写得比听讲话还难懂。要说文章和平常谈话有什么不同，那只是文章比平常谈话更准确些，更周到些，更简炼些，更有条理些。打个比方，平常的谈话好像是个毛坯，写成文章就是对这个毛坯加工。但是第一，不能丢掉这个毛坯，第二，加工的结果不能失去原形。
    有人又会说：“口语不登大雅之堂，严肃的文章里不能用，文件里更不能用”。这种说法真有点不够严肃。请看看，去年10月6日我们国防部的“告台湾同胞书”。还有10月25日的“再告台湾同胞书”，那里面就有很多口语。像什么“美国老爷”“爱管闲事”，帝国主义分子“都没有良心”，“我劝你们当心一点儿”，“谢天谢地，我们这个国家，算是被一位美国老爷看见了”，“我们都是中国人”，“打一些炮，引起你们注意”。这些话，不都是我们口头上常说的吗？为什么那样重要的文告里用这些话不感到丝毫不严肃，别的文章倒不能用呢？
    有些人写的文章，不是力求口语化，简直是力求难懂，文章中的好多话，并不是作者自己的话，有的像京戏的道白，有的像翻译得不好的电影的台词。使人看了忍不住要发笑，应该说，这才是真正的不严肃呢！本来是活人，却不用活的语言，本来是现代人，却不用现代的话！偏偏要“半文半白”“半古半今”，这实在是件不光彩的事，可是有人却习以为常，不以为怪。
    “口语化是不是不能表达复杂的思想呢？”这要看你到底怎样看。人民群众天天都在说话，他们并不都是思想简单的。拿词汇来说，口语化并不是不要科学名词，而是要口语和科学名词相结合。新的话，新名词，群众里面多得很。“人民公社”、“工具改革”、“提高劳动生产率”、“技术革命”、“大跃进”、“两条腿走路”、“九个指头和一个指头”，数不尽的新话，已经在群众里面生了根，不能用绅士的眼光去看群众的语言，以为他们讲话都是粗俗、简单的。最好的话，一针见血的话，常常正是出在群众当中。
    现在有一些人不会讲群众的话，故意用高深来遮丑。不妨举个例子。例如有人说：“三轮车工人同志，你如果能在一刻钟的条件下把我送到火车站那个目的地，那么，我将付给你多于现在应付的代价的两倍的代价”。这几句话，说得倒很合乎逻辑上的“假言判断”，也很精确周密，就是洋得很，三轮车工人听起来，会把他当作多少有点神经病。照平常讲话，就是说：“同志，踏快点，一刻钟赶到车站，我加倍给钱”。这样难道会说不清意思吗？为什么一定要故作高深呢？当然，这个例子是我编出来的，并不是真的有人那样说话。不过，写文章就不同了，就真的有人是那样的写法了。你说他不对吧，他并不服气，脸红了！脖子也粗了，回答说：“不这样就不精确呀！”其实，口语化并不反对新的话，也不反对新的句法，就是有一点：不能离开群众，不能离开中国人民的语言习惯。
    “文言是不是一点不能用呢？”这要看你用的文言是不是还活在群众的语言当中。“岂有此理”这是文言，群众现在还时常用。“欺人太甚”“水落石出”，也是文言，群众也不丢掉它。可是，你不要不看对象去搬许多老古董，也不要把念起来顺口的话照古文那样写得只可以看、不可以念。例如你不要把“在什么什么的时候”写成“在什么什么时”，把“但是”写成“但”，把“并且”、“而且”写成“并”“而”，这样就不是口语化了。口语化总归要念起来顺口，和平时讲话差不多。
    要作到文章口语化，这就逼着我们非做好两件事情不可。第一，一定要把问题弄通，如果自己对问题都不大懂，没有真正的体会，就很难写出像平时说话那样的文章。第二，一定要熟悉群众，熟悉他们的思路，熟悉他们议论问题的方式方法，熟悉他们的口吻，熟悉他们常用的词汇，这才能很自然地按照群众的语言习惯来写文章，一步一步地改掉“学生腔”。所以要做到文章口语化，不能单在文字技术上下功夫，更重要的是要深入实际，深入群众，把要写的东西，要讲的道理，融会贯通，才能够深入浅出，写出通俗明白的口语化的文章来。
