Judge and Traffickers

On May 4th, New York City cracked down on an international black market ring trafficking in babies. According to the “New York Herald Tribune,” Stephen Scopas, a seemingly respectable New York City judge, was a member of the group. Along with Scopas, lawyer Cohen, Peter, a New York travel agent, and Isaac, a secretary at a New York shipping company, were also arrested.

Scopas was a favored figure under New York City Mayor Wagner. He was appointed as a New York City judge in 1956, with his term scheduled to expire on June 30, 1960. Wagner reluctantly requested Scopas's resignation on May 2nd and ordered his arrest, indicating his difficult situation.

In recent years, the secret activities of Americans buying Greek babies in Greece and shipping them to the United States for resale at high prices have sparked international public opinion. On February 24th, the British "Times" publicly reported that for six years, American "merchants" and "agents" had purchased 1,200 babies in Greece, including 537 from September 1957 to December 1958.

In the United States, some childless couples are ineligible to adopt due to mental illness or other reasons, and they are the clients of human traffickers. According to official statistics from Athens, most of the Greek babies adrift in the United States are "adopted" by these American couples. They deliberately fail to complete legal procedures during "adoption" to avoid legal ties with the babies. Some couples feel troubled and tired not long after "adopting" Greek babies. Then American "merchants" and "agents" can resell these children to others.

The “New York Herald Tribune” said that since Scopas took office, he has earned huge income by participating in the black market ring trafficking in Greek babies. From the second half of 1956 to November 1957, Scopas earned $16,800 from this activity. According to the "New York Times" on May 5th, Scopas sold 30 Greek babies at a price of approximately $1,500 to $2,000 each. To solicit "business," Scopas allowed customers to "purchase" on an "installment plan."

The "New York Times" said, "Take a transaction of $1,500 as an example. After the transaction is settled, $250 is paid immediately. After the State Department issues an entry visa, another $250 is paid. When Scopas notifies the adopting couple of the approval of the Greek court, another $250 is paid. Finally, when Scopas announces that the baby will be flown to the United States, the final $750 is paid." It is truly:

	A seemingly respectable judge,
	Is actually a human trafficker,
	With many tricks to attract customers,
	Payment is made after the deal is done. (Image attached)

    法官与人口贩子
    5月4日，纽约市破获了一个国际贩运婴儿的黑市交易集团。据
  “纽约先驱论坛报”报道，道貌岸然的纽约市法官斯蒂芬·斯柯帕斯是该集团的一个成员。与斯柯帕斯同时被捕的尚有律师柯恩、纽约一家旅行社经纪人彼得斯和纽约一家轮船公司的秘书伊萨克。
    斯柯帕斯是纽约市市长瓦格纳手下的一名得宠的人物。他是1956年被任命为纽约市法官的。照规定任期将于1960年6月30日届满。现在瓦格纳忍痛于5月2日要求斯柯帕斯自动辞职，并且下命被捕入狱，是有不得已的苦衷的。
    最近几年以来，美国人在希腊暗中收买希腊婴儿，运往美国，高价出售给美国无儿女的夫妇的勾当，已经引起了国际舆论的议论。今年2月24日的英国“泰晤士报”公开报道，六年以来，美国“商人”、
  “代理人”在希腊收买了一千二百名婴儿，从1957年9月至1958年12月就收购了五百三十七名。
    在美国，有一些无儿女的夫妇们，由于精神病或其他原因，没有收养婴儿的资格，他们就是人口贩子的主顾。流落美国的希腊婴儿，据雅典官方的统计，大都是由这一类美国夫妇“收养”的。他们在“收养”的时候故意不履行法律手续，以避免与婴儿发生法律的关系。有些夫妇“收养”了希腊婴儿不多几时就感到麻烦、厌倦。于是美国的“商人”、“代理人”，就可以把这些孩子转卖给别人。
    “纽约先驱论坛报”说，自从斯柯帕斯上任以来，由于参加了贩运希腊婴儿的黑市交易集团活动下他获得了巨大的收入。从1956年，半年至1957年11月，斯柯帕斯从事这个勾当的收入达一万六千八百美元。据“纽约时报”5月5日透露，斯柯帕斯经售了三十名希腊婴儿，每名售价约在美金一千五百元至二千元之间。斯柯帕斯为了兜揽“生意”，允许顾客以“分期付款”的方式来“购货”。
  “纽约时报”说，“试以一千五百元一宗的交易为例。交易谈妥后立即先付二百五十元。当国务院发下入境签证以后，续付二百五十元。当斯柯帕斯以希腊法院批准的消息通知收养的夫妇时，再付二百五十元。最后，当斯柯帕斯通知说，婴儿即将由空运来美，就交付最后的七百五十元。”正是：
    道貌岸然一法官，
    原来是个人口贩，
    招揽主顾多法宝，
    交易谈妥后付款。（附图片）
