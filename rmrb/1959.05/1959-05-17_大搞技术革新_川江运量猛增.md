Through Massive Technological Innovation, Sichuan River Transport Volume Increases Sharply

    (Our report) Sichuan Province's inland river navigation has undergone massive technological innovation, greatly increasing transport capacity.
    Sichuan's inland river navigation largely relies on wooden sailing boats. In recent years, although large numbers of new boats have been built and many new boatmen added every year, the backwardness of wooden sailing boat transport has made it far from meeting the needs of growing transport volume.
    Since the start of the mass steelmaking campaign in the second half of last year, the contradiction of transport capacity lagging behind transport volume has become increasingly prominent. Under the attention and leadership of relevant party and government leading departments in Sichuan Province, large and small waterways on the Sichuan River mobilized the masses to carry out technological revolution, implementing wooden boat towage, night navigation, improved boat types, winch-assisted passage over shoals, mechanized port loading and unloading, and the development of motorized wooden boats. This has greatly increased transport capacity. In the first quarter of this year, the province added 180,000 tons of transport capacity, equivalent to 45% of the existing total tonnage of wooden boats. Despite the heavy transport volume in the first quarter, the province still overfulfilled the transportation tasks of steel and grain by 1.9%.
    The realization of wooden boat towage is a tremendous innovation in water transport on the Sichuan River. Towage forms include suspension towage, binding towage, and suspension-binding towage. Luzhou Port once towed eight wooden boats with a main boat carrying 120 tons of cargo, safely passing through 87 dangerous shoals to reach Chongqing. On the Qu River, a main boat once towed thirty-four wooden boats for hundreds of kilometers. Currently, over 10,000 wooden boats across the province have implemented towage, accounting for half of the total tonnage. Wooden boat towage has basically been realized on major rivers such as the Jialing River, Qu River, Fu River, Tuo River, Min River, and Wu River. Implementing wooden boat towage generally saves 30% to 50% of labor. Since the second half of last year, 80,000 tons of wooden boats that had been out of service due to lack of labor have all participated in production, allowing for the transportation of over 2 million tons of additional materials per year.
    Inspired by night navigation on the Yangtze River, boatmen began experimenting with night navigation on the Qu River in the second half of last year. Wooden boat workers used wood, bamboo, and kerosene lamps to make makeshift light beacons. Currently, over 400 kilometers of makeshift light beacons have been set up throughout the river, allowing 15,000 wooden boats to travel day and night, increasing the utilization rate of boats by half. Quxian Port alone can transport over 700,000 tons of additional materials per year. After makeshift light beacons were installed and night navigation was implemented on the Tuo River basin running through central Sichuan, the transport volume doubled. In the past, sugar factories in the Neijiang area were often affected by the lack of sugarcane transport, hindering normal production. After the implementation of night navigation on the Tuo River, the supply of sugarcane has been guaranteed.
    In terms of reforming transportation tools, the Sichuan River has gathered the advantages of various boats from within and outside the province. Based on the characteristics of the Sichuan River, with its many shoals, shallow waters, and small channels, boats with deep drafts, small loads, and slow speeds were transformed into boats with shallow drafts, large loads, fast speeds, easy operation, and safety. Since the second half of last year, the vast number of boatmen have created many types, such as "fish belly boats," "seven-in-one," "nine-in-one," "double-wing boats," "four-wing boats," and "three-section boats." Generally, they increase the load without increasing the number of people, increasing the carrying capacity by 10% to 60%. The province has increased transport capacity by 120,000 tons through improved boat types. These boat types are suitable for rivers of all sizes, and their effects are even greater on waterways with many shoals and shallow water. The province is vigorously promoting "fish belly boats." According to preliminary calculations, if all boats are transformed into fish belly boats, the province can increase transport capacity by 190,000 tons.
    The most labor-intensive and manpower-consuming aspects of inland river transport are the two stages of boats passing over shoals (especially upstream) and port loading and unloading. Boatmen describe the pain of pulling boats over shoals as: "Feet treading on goose stones, hands gripping sand, waist aching and legs numb." Passing over a shoal takes at least one or two hours. Therefore, the boatmen's demand for technological revolution is also the most urgent. Since the second half of last year, over 200 ports and shipping areas under the jurisdiction of the Wu River, Fu River, Jialing River, Changning River, and Qingliu River have installed makeshift winches created by the boatmen themselves, realizing mechanized winch-assisted passage over shoals. Mechanical winches can speed up boat turnover and greatly reduce labor intensity. After these rivers implemented mechanized winches, they can transport over 1 million tons of additional goods per year, equivalent to an increase of 40,000 tons of transport capacity. Boatmen in ports and docks in various places have also created loading and unloading tools such as wooden rail transport tracks, makeshift cranes, and chutes. Larger ports such as Jiangkou, Mao'ertuo, Luzhou, Tongliang, and Guangyuan along the Yangtze River have now realized mechanized and semi-mechanized loading and unloading, greatly improving labor efficiency.
    Fuling Prefecture and other places have also successfully trial-produced a type of gas-powered motorized boat, which can increase the carrying capacity by more than double compared to the original, the speed is three times faster than ordinary wooden boats, and it can save 80% of labor. The province plans to build 50,000 tons of new boats in the second quarter of this year to adapt to the rapid growth in the transport volume of steel, coal, and grain in the second half of the year. Currently, Dazhou, Leshan, and other prefectures have successively produced more than 10,000 tons and put them into production. In the past two years, Sichuan Province has also opened up 69 small river tributaries in remote mountainous areas such as Tongjiang, Lueyang, and Mabian, increasing the annual transport volume by more than 10 million tons. After half a year of rectification of over 200 dangerous shoals near Fuling in the Wu River basin, the water level has been raised, and the transport volume has increased by 40%. Now, not only wooden boats can pass smoothly, but also ships have begun to pass. This year, the province also plans to continue to rectify and open up more than 1,000 kilometers of waterways to increase transport routes and further improve transport efficiency. (Attached picture)

    大搞技术革新　川江运量猛增
    本报讯　四川省内河航运大搞技术革新，运力大增。
    四川内河航运大部分依靠木帆船。几年来，虽然年年都添造大批新船只，增加不少新船工，但由于木帆船运输方式落后，远不能满足运量增长的需要。
    从去年下半年全民大炼钢铁开始，运力跟不上运量的矛盾就愈加突出，在四川省党、政有关领导部门的重视和领导下，川江大小航道发动群众大搞技术革命，实行了木船拖带化、夜航、改良船型，实行绞滩和港口装卸机械化，发展机动木船等，运力大增，今年第一季度，全省共增加运力十八万吨，相当于现有木船总吨位的45％，在今年第一季度运量相当繁重的情况下，仍超额1.9％完成了钢铁、粮食等运输任务。
    木船拖带化的实现，是川江水上运输的巨大创举，拖带形式有吊拖、绑拖和吊绑拖。泸州港曾以一只装载量一百二十吨的木船拖带八只木船，经过八十七处滩险安全到达重庆。渠江河上一只主船曾拖带三十四艘木船航行了上百公里。现在全省实现拖带化的木船已达一万多只，占总吨位的一半。嘉陵江、渠江、涪江、沱江、岷江、乌江等主要河道上都已基本上实现了木船拖带化。实行木船拖带，一般可节省劳动力30％到50％。全省去年下半年以来，八万吨因缺乏劳动力而停驶的木船便全部参加了生产，一年可多运物资二百多万吨。
    船工们在长江夜航的启示下，又从去年下半年起，在渠江试行了夜航。木船工人自己动手用木材、竹材和煤油灯制成土灯标。目前，全江已设置土灯标的有四百多公里，有一万五千只木船可以昼夜兼程，使船只利用率提高了一半，其中仅渠县港一年就可多运物资七十多万吨。贯穿四川中部的沱江流域安上土灯标，实行夜航以后，使运输量加了一番。过去内江地区的制糖厂，经常因为甘蔗运输跟不上影响正常生产，沱江实行夜航后，甘蔗供应已得到了保证。
    在改革运输工具方面，川江集中了省内各地和省外各种船只的优点，根据川江滩多、水浅、漕口小的特点，将吃水深、载量小、航速慢的船只改造成吃水浅、载量大、航速快、容易操作而又安全的船只。从去年下半年以来，广大船工先后创造的有“鱼肚船”、“七合一”、“九合一”、“双翼船”、“四翼船”、
  “三节船”等许多种。一般都是增载不增人，提高载重量10％到60％。全省通过改良船型挖出的运力已达十二万吨。这些船型适用于大小河流，特别在滩多水枯的航道上发挥的作用更大。全省各地正在大力推广“鱼肚船”，据初步计算，如果所有船只都改造成鱼肚船，全省就可以挖出运力十九万吨。
    内河运输劳动强度最大、消耗人力最多的是船只过滩（特别是逆水）和港口装卸两个环节。船工们形容拉滩的痛苦说：“脚蹬鹅石手扒沙，腰干弯酸腿震麻”。过一次滩，至少要耽误一、两个小时。因此船工们对技术革命的要求也最迫切。从去年下半年，乌江、涪江、嘉陵江、长宁河、清流河等二百多个港口所辖航运区域，就已安装上了船工们自己创造的土绞滩机，实现了绞滩机械化。机械绞滩可以加速船只周转，大大减轻劳动强度。这些河流实行绞滩机械化后，一年可多运一百多万吨货物，相当于增加了四万吨运力。各地港口、码头的船工们还创造了木轨运输道、土起重机、梭槽等装卸工具。较大的港口如长江沿岸的江口、猫儿沱、泸州和铜梁、广元等地，现在都已实现机械化和半机械化装卸，劳动效率大大提高。
    涪陵专区等地还试制成功一种煤气机动船，载重量比原来可提高一倍以上，航速比普通木船要快三倍，并可节约劳动力80％。全省计划在今年第二季度内新造船只五万吨，以适应下半年钢、煤、粮运量急剧增长的需要。目前达县、乐山等专区已先后制成一万多吨投入生产。四川省最近两年还先后开辟了边远山区的通江、略阳、马边等小河支流六十九条，每年增加一千多万吨的运输量。乌江流域涪陵附近的二百多个滩险经过半年整治后，提高了水位，运量提高40％，现在不仅木船畅通，并已开始通行轮船了。今年全省还计划继续整治和开辟航道千余公里，以增加运输线路，进一步提高运输效率。（附图片）
