Old Red Army soldier Yu Guanghua left his wife and his child, who was not yet one year old, at the age of thirty-four, and embarked on the journey of the 25,000-li Long March. For a full twenty years, Comrade Yu Guanghua worked as a cook in the revolutionary ranks. To ensure that his comrades ate well and had enough to eat, Yu Guanghua spent countless sleepless nights. In 1950, the organization, in consideration of his health, decided to arrange for him to retire and recuperate. Yu Guanghua thought to himself, I am a Communist Party member, and as long as I am able to work, I must not let the state support me for nothing. "I come from a peasant background, please allow me to return home to engage in production." That winter, he returned to his hometown, which he had left twenty years earlier, filled with the joy of victory.

"After running around outside for twenty years, will he still know how to farm?" Many people expressed doubts about whether Yu Guanghua would be able to engage in production labor after returning home. Comrade Lao Yu heard it and kept it in mind. He strictly demanded of himself, going to the fields to work before dawn every day, and then coming back to cook and feed the pigs, doing the work of several people alone. Whenever he encountered difficulties, he tried his best to recall the thousands of scenes from the Long March to encourage himself. In recent years, he would go to the fields every morning to collect a load of wild manure before the sky began to turn pale in the east. Then he would call the commune members to get up and go to work together. During the noon break, he would also go to the mountains to cut grass for the cattle and do odd jobs. The commune members said, "Since Lao Yu came home, the day dawns earlier!"

One snowy night in December 1955, the commune committee, in order to complete the task of building a reservoir before the Lunar New Year, decided to fight through the snow at night. Comrade Yu Guanghua braved the wind and snow, took off his cotton-padded coat first, rolled up his trouser legs, and walked towards the construction site. "Lao Yu is so old and he has come to work, shouldn't we go too?" The commune members joined the night battle one after another. Yu Guanghua fought day and night with the masses, and many commune members advised him, "Now there are so many people, it doesn't matter if one person is missing." Comrade Lao Yu always said, "More people means more strength!" The following year, the thousand mu of land irrigated by the reservoir reaped a bumper harvest. The masses said gratefully, "Thanks to Comrade Lao Yu!"

Comrade Yu Guanghua is the commune's storekeeper; the commune members praised him as the commune's lock. He has never made a mistake as a storekeeper. In the autumn of the year before last, the commune's rice and peanuts were carried to the threshing ground to dry during the day and had to be taken back at night. The threshing ground was far from the houses, and it took a lot of manpower to carry them in and out every day. Yu Guanghua discussed with the commune director, "Let's leave the rice on the threshing ground, and I'll watch over it at night." Due to his insistence, the commune director agreed. The cold wind blowing through was a minor problem, the most troublesome thing was the sleepiness that would come from time to time. Lao Yu secretly ordered himself to rub his eyelids from time to time to cheer himself up, and when he was really tired, he would get up and walk around. Late at night, he was afraid that the dew would wet the rice, so he pulled the straw from the shed and covered it on the rice piles, and he sat by the rice piles until dawn, watching over it for more than twenty days in a row.

    老红军余光华
    余光华同志在三十四岁那一年，离别了妻子和未满周岁的孩子，踏上了二万五千里长征的途程。整整二十年，余光华在革命队伍里一直作炊事员的工作。为了保证战友们吃好吃饱，余光华不知熬过了多少个不眠的夜晚。1950年，组织上为了照顾他的身体，决定安置他休养。余光华心想，我是一个共产党员，在还能够劳动的时候，绝不能让国家白白养活我。“我是农民出身，请允许我回家生产。”就在这年冬天，他怀着胜利的喜悦，回到离别二十年的故乡。
    “在外边跑了二十年还会种田？”许多群众对余光华回乡是否能够生产劳动表示怀疑。老余同志听在耳里，记在心里。他严格要求着自己，每天天不亮就下田生产，回来再煮饭、喂猪，一个人做几个人的事情。每当遇到困难的时候，他就竭力回忆长征途中的万千情景鼓舞自己。这几年来，他每天清晨到野外拣一趟野粪回来，东方才泛起鱼肚白。他再招呼社员起床，一同出工。中午大家休息了，他还要到山上割牛草，干点零活。社员们说：“老余回家后，天都亮早了！”
    1955年12月间一个雪夜，社委会为了在旧历年前完成兴修水库的任务，决定冒雪夜战。余光华同志迎着风雪，第一个脱下棉袄，卷起裤脚走向工地。“老余这么大年纪都出了工，我们还不该去？”社员们纷纷参加了夜战。余光华日日夜夜与群众战斗在一起，许多社员劝他，“现在这么多人，少一个人也不要紧。”老余同志总是说：“多一个人就多一分力量嘛！”第二年，水库灌溉的一千亩田获得了大丰收。群众感激地说：“多亏老余同志！”
    余光华同志是社里的保管员；社员们称赞他是社里的一把锁。他当保管员从来都没有出过差错。前年秋天，社里的谷子和花生，白天挑到坪上晒，晚上要收回去。晒场离房子很远，每天挑进挑出需要好多人工。余光华和社主任商量，“把谷子放在坪上，夜晚我去看守。”由于他的坚持，社主任答应了。晚风吹过，冷倒是小问题，最伤脑筋的是睡意不时袭来。老余暗暗给自己下命令，不时揉揉眼皮，振作振作精神，实在疲倦时，就起来走动走动。夜深了，他怕露水把谷子打湿，就把棚子上的稻草拉下来盖在谷堆上，自己在谷堆边坐到天光，这样一连看守了二十多天。      （会）
