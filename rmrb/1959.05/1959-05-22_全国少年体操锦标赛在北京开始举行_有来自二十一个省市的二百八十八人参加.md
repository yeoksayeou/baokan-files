Xinhua News Agency, May 20th: The 1959 National Junior Gymnastics Championships began today at the Shichahai Sports Hall in Beijing. The various light and graceful gymnastic movements performed by the male and female gymnasts under the age of seventeen from various regions won the praise of the audience today.

This is the third national junior gymnastics competition held in our country since 1956. The 288 young athletes participating in the competition come from 21 provinces, cities, and autonomous regions. They will hold a three-day competition here to determine the top eight places in the team and individual competitions.

Among the six junior men's gymnastics teams participating in today's competition, the Guangdong men's team ranked first with a total score of 326.2 points (calculated from the scores of the six best team members). The average age of the team's eight members is only fifteen years old. Yu Bide and Li Zhixiong, both fifteen years old from the Guangdong men's team, performed accurate and rhythmic movements, and their individual total scores were also the best, both reaching 55.3 points (out of a full score of 60).

Unlike adult gymnastics competitions, this junior men's and women's gymnastics competition only involves compulsory routines, not optional routines. However, both male and female junior athletes must participate in all six events within one day. The six events for men are: floor exercise, horizontal bar, parallel bars, rings, pommel horse, and vaulting box; the events for women are: floor exercise, uneven bars, balance beam, low horizontal bar, swinging rings, and side horse vault.
