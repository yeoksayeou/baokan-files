Xinhua News Agency, 30th: The rape seed harvest has already begun in provinces south of the Yangtze River such as Hunan and Jiangxi. The harvested rape has generally increased production compared to last year.

The over thirty million mu of rape that will be harvested throughout the country this year is growing exceptionally well. In particular, the rape in major rape-producing areas such as Sichuan, Guizhou, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangsu, and Shanghai is growing even better, generally more than one person tall, with dense layers of full pods.

Most of the particularly well-grown crops are of the improved Victory Rape variety. Of the more than 30 million mu of rape nationwide, Victory Rape accounts for 15 million mu. The yield of Victory Rape is generally about twice that of ordinary rape. This is a major guarantee for this year's large-scale rape harvest.

Xinhua News Agency, 30th: In the northern pastoral areas that have basically achieved people's communeization, thousands upon thousands of collective herdsmen are smiling and busily engaged in lambing and lamb rearing day and night. Recently, according to incomplete statistics from the Ministry of Agriculture, more than 8,180,000 lambs have been delivered in provinces and regions such as Inner Mongolia, Ningxia, Gansu, Qinghai, and Xinjiang. In the grasslands of Inner Mongolia, male and female herders had delivered more than 4,530,000 lambs by April 15th. The Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, known for producing Tan sheep lambskins, has delivered more than 430,000 lambs. On the lush grasslands north and south of the Tianshan Mountains in Xinjiang, herders have also delivered more than 350,000 lambs. The abundant lamb harvest in these areas has created conditions for providing more mutton, milk, and wool products to the people.

After the realization of people's communeization in pastoral areas, it has brought extremely favorable conditions for the development of animal husbandry. People's communes in many pastoral areas have rationally allocated pastureland on a larger scale, utilizing grasslands; rationally allocated and arranged labor, strengthening feeding management; and uniformly allocated epidemic prevention and breeding technical forces, strengthening breeding work and epidemic prevention work. Before lambing, herders in various places made a series of preparations for lambing.

Due to the good work in ewe feeding management and other aspects, the characteristics of this year's lamb harvest are: high lamb survival rate; many multiple births per ewe; and many improved breed lambs. The lamb survival rate in Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, Ningxia, and Gansu has reached 80% to 90%, and the survival rate in individual areas has reached "100 births, 100 live," and the lamb weight is generally higher than in previous years. Among the 300,000 prolific ewes that produce multiple lambs in Inner Mongolia, about 60% have already given birth to twins or triplets. At the Gongnais Stud Farm, a Xinjiang fine-wool sheep base, among the more than 4,400 ewes that have already given birth, more than 1,500 have produced twins, and more than 20 have produced triplets. The lamb survival rate has reached over 96%, and the lambs are generally plump and strong. More than 1,700,000 crossbred lambs improved by fine wool sheep have been produced in Inner Mongolia, which is several times more than the total number of improved lambs produced in the past few years.

In order to rapidly propagate sheep, various places have strengthened the feeding management of ewes after lambing to quickly fatten them and seized the estrus period to carry out rebreeding. More than one million ewes in Inner Mongolia have undergone timely postpartum breeding.

    长江以南油菜结荚累累
    一些牧区羊群一产多羔
    新华社30日讯　长江以南的湖南、江西等省已经开始收获油菜籽。已收获的油菜普遍比去年增产。
    今年全国即将收获的三千几百万亩油菜，生长得空前的好。特别是主要油菜产区四川、贵州、湖北、湖南、江苏、上海等省市的油菜长得更好，一般都有一人多高，饱满的荚实密密层层。
    长得特别好的大多是良种胜利油菜。全国三千多万亩油菜中，胜利油菜占一千五百万亩。胜利油菜的产量一般比普通油菜约高一倍。这是今年油菜大面积丰收的一大保证。
    据新华社30日讯　基本上实现人民公社化的北方牧区，成千上万的集体牧民们都喜笑颜开，日夜紧张地进行接羔和育羔工作。最近，据农业部不完全统计，内蒙古、宁夏、甘肃、青海、新疆等省、区，已接产羊羔八百一十八万多只。内蒙古草原上的男女牧民们，到4月15日止，已接产羊羔四百五十三万多只。产滩羊羔皮著称的宁夏回族自治区，已接产羊羔四十三万多只。在新疆天山南北肥美的草原上，牧民们也已接产羊羔三十五万多只。这些地区羊羔丰收，将给人们提供更多的羊肉、羊奶和羊毛制品创造了条件。
    牧区在实现人民公社化后，给畜牧业的发展带来了极为有利的条件。不少牧区的人民公社在更大的范围内合理地调配牧地，利用草滩；合理地调配和安排劳动力，加强饲养管理；统一调配防疫和配种技术力量，加强了配种工作和疫病防治工作。在接羔以前，各地牧民们作好了一系列的接羔准备工作。
    由于母羊饲养管理等工作做的好，今年羊羔丰收的特点是：羊羔成活率高；很多一羊产多羔；改良种羊羔多。内蒙古、新疆、宁夏和甘肃等地接产的羊羔成活率都达80％至90％，个别地区的成活率达到了“百产百活”，羊羔体重一般都比往年增加。内蒙古全区培养的三十万只一胎多羔丰产母羊中，有60％左右已产了双羔或三羔。新疆细毛羊的基地——巩乃斯种羊场，在已产羊羔的四千四百多只母羊中，产双羔的有一千五百多只，产三羔的有二十多只，羊羔成活率达到96％以上，而且羊羔普遍膘肥体壮。内蒙古全区已产细毛羊改良的杂种羔一百七十多万只，这比过去几年所产的改良羊羔的总数还多几倍。
    各地为了羊只的迅速繁殖，在母羊产羔后加强了母羊饲养管理，使母羊很快肥壮，抓住发情期进行再次配种。内蒙古进行产后及时配种的母羊达一百多万只。
