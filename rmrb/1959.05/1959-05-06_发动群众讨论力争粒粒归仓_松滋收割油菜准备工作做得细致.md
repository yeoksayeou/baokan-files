    Songzi Makes Meticulous Preparations for Rapeseed Harvesting

    (By our reporter) Eight thousand hectares of rapeseed in Songzi County, Hubei Province, have matured and are about to be harvested. Currently, under the slogan "Thoroughly Break Through the Rapeseed Harvesting Barrier, Ensure Every Grain Returns to the Granary and Achieve a Bumper Harvest," people's communes in various locations are making a series of preparations in terms of ideology, organization, and tools.

    This year, the rapeseed in the whole county is growing better than in any previous year, with high yields and early maturity. The county party committee instructed the communes to prepare for the rapeseed harvest early. According to the instructions of the county party committee, various locations have successively held symposiums with labor models, experienced farmers, and technicians to specifically study the practical problems in harvesting. The Baobao Commune's Baishuitang Production Team held a symposium of more than ten people, including rapeseed expert Xie Shangzhi, rapeseed girl Chen Wang, and the team leader, to summarize last year's lessons: due to insufficient preparation and careless harvesting, four hundred and forty mu of rapeseed yielded twenty jin less per mu, resulting in a loss of eighty-eight hundred jin for the whole team. This made them realize the importance of making preparations early this year. They established seven hundred and twenty-four rapeseed harvesting shock teams composed of four thousand people, planning to start harvesting with sickles in early May.

    In order to complete the harvesting task on time, various places have also mobilized the masses to modify the unreasonable aspects of the labor quotas for rapeseed. At the same time, arrangements have also been made for harvesting tools.

　　发动群众讨论力争粒粒归仓
    松滋收割油菜准备工作做得细致
    本报讯　湖北松滋县八万多亩油菜已经硬粒，即将开始收割。目前各地人民公社在“大破油菜收割关，粒粒归仓得丰收”口号鼓舞下，从思想、组织、工具等方面作了一系列的准备工作。
    全县今年油菜比任何一年都生长得好，产量高，成熟早。县委及早指示各公社作好油菜收割的准备。各地按县委指示，先后召开了劳动模范、老农、技术员等座谈会，专门研究收割中的具体问题。八宝公社白水淌生产队召开了油菜丰产能手谢尚志、油菜姑娘陈望及队长等十多人的座谈会，总结了去年的教训：由于准备不够，收打不细致，使四百四十亩油菜，每亩少收二十斤，全队要损失八千八百斤。从而认识到今年及早动手作好准备的重要意义。他们建立了由四万人组成的七百二十四个油菜收获突击队，打算在5月上旬动镰收割。
    为了按时完成收割任务，各地还发动群众，对油菜方面劳动定额不合理的部分作了修改。同时，对收割工具也作了安排。
