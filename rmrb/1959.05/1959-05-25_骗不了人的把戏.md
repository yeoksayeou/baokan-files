A Trick That Fools No One
People's Daily Commentator

Recently, Nobusuke Kishi once again performed a glib act on the issue of Sino-Japanese relations. During his campaign speeches to support Liberal Democratic Party candidates for the House of Councillors in various parts of Japan, Kishi repeatedly emphasized that "Sino-Japanese relations are a problem that must be resolved," and that he "intends to find a way to solve this problem himself." If Kishi thinks that by making such a performance repeatedly in recent times, he can make people believe him, then he is simply ridiculous.

For the Chinese people (and for the vast number of Japanese people as well), Kishi's talk about Sino-Japanese relations in this manner is nothing new. We are so familiar with it that whenever we hear Kishi make such statements, we can accurately predict that it is time for Japan to hold this or that election again. In Japan, the proposition of promoting Sino-Japanese friendship and restoring Sino-Japanese relations is so deeply rooted in people's hearts that even the openly pro-American and anti-communist Japanese reactionaries never abandon using it to win votes. Therefore, a government like the Kishi Nobusuke government, which was brought to power with the support of American monopoly capital, despite consistently pursuing a policy of following the United States and opposing China, inevitably makes various false gestures on the issue of Sino-Japanese relations to deceive Japanese voters whenever Japan holds major or minor elections. But as soon as the election is over, they not only revert to their original state, but also simply dismiss those glib words. This is a lesson that the Chinese people have learned from constantly listening to Kishi's words and observing his actions in recent years, and it has proven to be almost always effective and foolproof. This time, naturally, is no exception. Japan's fifth House of Councillors election after the war will be held on June 2. This election will elect one hundred and twenty-five councillors, half of the councillors in the House of Councillors whose terms have expired, and two vacant seats. In order to realize the conspiracy to revise the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" and amend the Japanese Constitution, the Kishi Nobusuke government and the ruling Liberal Democratic Party are eager to seize as many seats as possible in this election. In order to achieve this goal, the Kishi Nobusuke government and the Liberal Democratic Party, while putting forward a series of election slogans, inciting anti-Soviet and anti-communist sentiments, and engaging in various activities that violate the election law, have once again attempted to take advantage of the widespread desire of the Japanese people to restore Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations by making deceptive gestures to break the deadlock in Sino-Japanese relations in order to win votes.

However, no matter how vivid and realistic Kishi's performance is, it cannot fool people. As early as about a year ago, the Chinese people clearly put forward three principles for breaking the deadlock in Sino-Japanese relations, namely, the Kishi Nobusuke government must (1) stop implementing policies hostile to China; (2) not participate in the conspiracy to create "two Chinas"; and (3) not obstruct the restoration of normal relations between China and Japan and take corresponding measures. Since then, Kishi has shown no intention of reflecting on his actions. The "Diplomatic Blue Book" published by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Kishi Nobusuke government on May 16 is the most powerful proof. This document affirms the Kishi Nobusuke government's policy of subservience to the United States, and is full of undisguised anti-Soviet and anti-China rhetoric. It expresses its refusal to allow Japan to adopt a neutral stance, and reiterates that "strengthening self-defense capabilities and establishing a Japan-U.S. security guarantee system are the basic lines of (Japan's) diplomacy"; that is, it is openly preparing to continue to pursue a blatant policy of hostility toward China and a conspiracy to establish a military alliance aimed at aggression against China, the Soviet Union, and Asian countries. From this, it can be seen that Kishi's attitude of hostility toward our country has not changed fundamentally, and has become even more rampant and undisguised. We must expose Kishi's double-dealing tactics. The Chinese people will not be fooled by Kishi Nobusuke. We believe that the Japanese people will not be fooled by him either. We hope that Japan's insightful friends who sincerely hope to improve Sino-Japanese relations will not be fooled by him either.

    骗不了人的把戏
    本报评论员
    最近一些时候，岸信介又一次对中日关系的问题，作了一场油腔滑调的表演。岸信介在声援日本各地的自由民主党人竞选参议员的旅行演讲中，一再强调“日中关系是一个必须加以解决的问题”，他“打算自己去找出解决这个问题的线索”。如果岸信介以为凭他近来三番五次作这样的表演，就能令人信以为真，那就未免可笑了。
    对于中国人民来说（对广大的日本人民也是同样的），岸信介用这种调调儿谈论中日关系，早已不是什么新鲜事情。我们对它是如此熟悉，以至每逢听到岸信介作出这一类的讲话，就能准确地推断出，又是日本将要举行这样或那样的选举的时候到了。在日本，促进中日友好、恢复中日关系的主张是这样的深入人心，连公开亲美反共的日本反动派，也从来不肯舍弃利用它来骗取选票。所以像由美国垄断资本扶植上台的岸信介这样的政府，尽管一向推行追随美国、敌视中国的政策，可是每当日本举行大小选举，也难免要在中日关系的问题上作出种种虚假姿态来欺骗日本选民。可是只待选举一过，他们不但一切又还其本来面貌，而且把那些油腔滑调的话也干脆一笔勾销了事。这是中国人民近几年来对岸信介不断听其言、观其行而得出来的一条经验，几乎是屡试有效、万无一失。这一次，自然也不例外。日本战后的第五次参议院选举，即将在6月2日举行。这次选举，将选出参议院中任期届满的半数参议员一百二十五人和两名缺额的议员。岸信介政府和执政的自由民主党为了实现修改日美“安全条约”和修改日本宪法的阴谋，亟图在这次选举中尽量多地攫取议席。为了达到这个目的，岸信介政府和自由民主党在提出一系列竞选口号、煽动反苏、反共和进行种种违反选举法的活动的同时，又一次企图利用作出打开中日关系僵局的欺骗姿态，来适应日本人民要求恢复中日邦交的普遍愿望，骗取选票。
    然而，不论岸信介的姿态表演得如何生动逼真，也是骗不了人的。中国人民早在约一年以前就明确地提出打开中日关系僵局的三项原则，这就是岸信介政府必须（1）停止执行敌视中国的政策；（2）不参加制造“两个中国”的阴谋；（3）不阻挠中日两国正常关系的恢复，并采取相应的措施。在这以后，岸信介丝毫没有反省之意。岸信介政府外务省在5月16日发表的“外交蓝皮书”，就是一个最有力的证明。这个文件肯定岸信介政府的屈从美国的外交政策，并且充满露骨敌视苏联和中国的论调。它表示拒绝使日本采取中立的立场，重申“加强自卫力量和建立日美安全保障体系是（日本）外交的基本路线”；也就是公开准备继续推行露骨的敌视中国和阴谋建立以侵略中苏和亚洲各国为目的的军事同盟的政策。由此看来，岸信介敌视我国的态度根本上毫无改变，而且更加猖狂露骨了。我们必须揭穿岸信介的这种两面手段。中国人民是不会上岸信介的当的。我们相信日本人民也同样地不会上他的当。我们希望日本的真诚希望改善中日关系的有见识的朋友们也不要上这个当才好。
