    Participating in Production, Protecting Production, Handling Cases While Laboring
    Political and Legal Work Ensures Safety and Construction Achieve Great Success

    (Our report) With the rapid development of socialist construction in our country, political and legal work has also made great leaps forward since last year, achieving tremendous success.

    The public security, procuratorial, and judicial departments have worked in coordination during the Great Leap Forward, solving a number of long-unsolved cases, clearing up a large number of backlogged cases, eliminating a group of vagrants, long-term fugitives, and other criminals hiding in some remote and backward areas. They also strengthened the struggle against security disasters and accidents, maintaining social order, thereby ensuring the safety of the Great Leap Forward of socialist construction in our country.

    Since 1958, the public security, procuratorial, and judicial organs have made new progress in implementing the Party's mass line. This is centrally reflected in the work of vigorously promoting the security movement. Safety, this slogan, fully embodies the requirements of socialist construction and the people, and at the same time, this slogan appropriately reflects the goal of the political and legal work. Therefore, when the call to vigorously promote the security movement was put forward, it immediately received a response from the broad masses of the people, forming a wave of enthusiasm for the security movement. Practice has proven that this is an extremely important development in the implementation of the mass line by political and legal work in the new situation, opening up new ways for the combination of specialized political and legal work with the broad masses of the people. Since 1958, the public security, procuratorial, and judicial departments have also used the methods of mass airing of views, big-character posters, and great debates to investigate and try cases. In the case-solving work of the public security, procuratorial, and judicial organs in Heze Prefecture, Shandong Province, more than 80% of the cases since last year have been solved through mass airing of views and debates. When the public security organs in Guiyang City, Guizhou Province, mobilized the masses to put up big-character posters, they received a large number of valuable materials exposing counter-revolutionaries and bad elements. A head of a Kuomintang secret agent group who had been lurking for many years felt that there was nowhere to escape under the power of the big-character posters, and was finally forced to confess his crimes. In Jinan Department Store, a case of posting reactionary slogans had not been solved after more than a year of investigation. The public security organs announced the reactionary slogans to the masses, and that day, the employees wrote more than 1,000 big-character posters. With conclusive evidence, the criminals had no choice but to confess their crimes.

    Since last year, cadres of the public security, procuratorial, and judicial departments have gone to the countryside and factories to participate in production and labor. They have made contributions to socialist construction in protecting production, and have also achieved great results in production and labor. Furthermore, they have further strengthened the relationship between political and legal cadres and the broad masses of the people, achieving a double harvest of labor and business. According to statistics from twenty provinces, cities, and autonomous regions, cadres of these three departments completed a total of more than 19.6 million workdays last year. In the Great Steel Smelting Movement last year, according to statistics from sixteen provinces and cities, staff members of the political and legal departments smelted a total of more than 66,000 tons of steel. In addition, according to statistics from nineteen provinces and cities, these three departments cultivated more than 3,000 mu of "experimental fields." Cadres of the political and legal departments in various places participated in labor on one hand, and protected production in labor on the other hand, handling cases on the spot, improving work efficiency, and facilitating the people. Wang Guisen, a judge of the People's Court of Luancheng County, Hebei Province, carried a manure basket and walked through more than 140 villages in 1958, collecting more than 5,000 jin of manure, and participating in labor for 54 days throughout the year. He strengthened the unity of the people, combated the sabotage activities of the enemy, and protected production. The masses were very satisfied. Zhang Xuexin, an assistant procurator of Shouzhang County, Shandong Province, went deep into Yaguang People's Commune, engaged in investigation work while working, and relied on the masses to promptly expose and legally deal with bad elements who had infiltrated the leadership positions within the commune, improving the consciousness of the masses and promoting the Great Leap Forward in production. Practice has proven that the combination of political and legal work and production labor is a correct policy. Only in this way can we better ensure the smooth progress of socialist construction.

    During the Great Leap Forward, public security organs and police officers all over the country actively did good deeds for the people, and launched the "Love the People Month" campaign in February and March this year, further strengthening ties with the masses and enhancing the power of the dictatorship over the enemy. Public security organs in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region have done 370,000 good deeds for the masses, and public security organs in Guangdong Province have done 570,000 good deeds for the masses. Many people's policemen in Guangzhou combined fire prevention inspections with helping residents repair stoves. People's policemen in the Central District alone assisted more than 800 households in repairing stoves. People's policemen in the Central District and the Northern District also helped families of martyrs and soldiers and households lacking labor in their jurisdictions with many household chores, such as chopping firewood, carrying water, washing clothes, and sweeping the floor. During the "Love the People Month," the people's policemen of the Tianjia'an Police Station of the Huaihe River Water Public Security Bureau in Anhui Province helped more than 30 out-of-town boat people and patients among passing travelers to receive treatment in the hospital. They also combined boarding boats to handle household registrations or going out to work with boats, helping boat people deal with more than 120 family disputes and marriage problems.

    In the past year or so, many models of selflessly saving others have emerged among public security, procuratorial, and judicial personnel. Chen Zhongliang, a policeman in Chongqing, risked his life to save the life of a four-year-old girl who was about to be crushed to death by a car that had lost its brakes, and was seriously injured himself. Gao Lianfen, a female police officer in Tianjin, saw that a child was about to be hit by a speeding tram. She immediately rushed to push the child to the side of the road, but she was injured by the tram. Their noble communist qualities have been praised by the masses, who call them "good police of Chairman Mao." (Attached picture)

    Chen Li (second from the left), a judge of the Pingshui People's Court in Shaoxing County, Zhejiang Province, closely relies on the leadership of the Party committee in his work, conscientiously implements the mass line, has a hard-working and in-depth style, closely revolves around the central work of the Party, and extensively carries out legal publicity. This is a photo of Chen Li going deep into the fields to handle cases, not afraid of high mountains and long distances.

    参加生产保卫生产  一面劳动一面办案
    政法工作保证安全建设取得了巨大成绩
    本报讯  随着我国社会主义建设的迅速发展，去年以来政法工作也有很大的跃进，取得了巨大的成绩。
    公安、检察、司法三个部门在大跃进中协同动作，破获了一批长期没有破获的案件，清理了大批积案，肃清了一批躲藏在某些偏僻和落后地区的流窜犯、长期漏网潜逃的罪犯和其他各种犯罪分子，还加强了同治安灾害和事故的斗争，维护了社会治安，从而保障了我国社会主义建设大跃进的安全。
    从1958年以来，公安、检察、司法机关在贯彻执行党的群众路线方面，有了新的进展。这集中地表现在大搞安全运动的工作上。安全，这个口号，充分地体现了社会主义建设事业和人民群众的要求，同时这个口号也恰当地体现了政法工作努力的目标。所以，当提出大搞安全运动的号召以后，立即得到广大人民群众的响应，形成了安全运动的热潮。实践证明，这是政法工作在新的形势下，实行群众路线的一个极其重要的发展，为政法专门工作同广大人民群众的结合开辟了新的途径。从1958年以来，公安、检察、司法三个部门还用大鸣大放、大字报、大辩论的方法，侦察案件和审判案件。山东省菏泽专区公安、检察、司法三个机关在破案工作中，去年以来有80％以上的案件都是通过群众鸣放辩论而破获的。贵州省贵阳市公安机关发动群众贴大字报时，收到了大量检举反革命分子和坏分子的有价值的材料。有一个潜伏多年的军统特务组长在大字报的威力下，感到无处逃身，终于被迫坦白交代。济南市百货大楼一件贴反动标语案，经过一年多侦察，没有破案。公安机关向群众公布了反动标语，当天职工就写了一千多张大字报，犯罪分子在证据确凿的情况下，不得不供认犯罪事实。
    去年以来，公安、检察、司法三个部门的工作干部纷纷下乡、下厂，参加生产劳动。他们在保卫生产上对社会主义建设做出了贡献，在生产劳动上也获得很大成绩，而且进一步密切了政法干部同广大群众的关系，达到了劳动、业务双丰收。据二十个省、市、自治区的统计，去年这三个部门的干部共做了一千九百六十多万个劳动日。在去年大办钢铁运动中，据十六个省、市的统计，政法部门的工作人员共炼出六万六千多吨钢铁。另外，据十九个省、市的统计，这三个部门共种了三千多亩“试验田”。各地政法干部一面参加劳动，一面在劳动中保卫生产，就地办案，提高了工作效率，便利了人民群众。河北省栾城县人民法院审判员王贵森在1958年中，身背粪筐，先后走过一百四十多个村庄，拾粪五千多斤，全年参加劳动五十四天，他一面劳动，一面办案，加强了人民内部的团结，打击了敌人的破坏活动，保卫了生产，群众都很满意。山东寿张县助理检察员张学信，深入亚光人民公社，一面劳动一面进行侦查工作，依靠群众及时揭发和依法处理了混入公社内部窃据领导职位的坏分子，提高了群众的觉悟，促进了生产的大跃进。实践证明，政法工作和生产劳动相结合，是一个正确的方针，只有这样，才能更好地保证社会主义建设事业的顺利进行。
    大跃进中，全国各地的公安机关和民警都积极地为人民群众办好事，并在今年2、3月间展开了爱民月的运动，进一步密切联系了群众，增强了对敌人专政的威力。内蒙古自治区公安机关已为群众办了三十七万件好事，广东省公安机关为群众办了五十七万件好事。广州市许多人民警察结合检查防火工作，帮助居民修改炉灶，仅中区人民警察就协助八百多户居民修改了炉灶。中区、北区的人民警察还帮助辖区内的烈、军属和缺乏劳力的住户做了很多家务事，如劈柴、挑水、洗衣、扫地等。安徽省淮河水上公安局田家庵派出所的人民警察，在爱民月期间帮助三十多个外地船民和过路旅客中的病患者到医院治疗，并且结合上船办户口或随船外出工作，帮助船民处理了家庭纠纷和婚姻问题一百二十多件。
    一年多来，在公安、检察和司法工作人员中，还出现了不少舍己救人的模范事迹。重庆的民警陈仲良在一辆汽车因刹车失灵将要轧死一个四岁的小女孩的紧急时刻里，冒着生命危险，抢救了小孩的生命，自己受了重伤。天津市女警察高连芬看到一个小孩即将被疾驶的电车撞倒，立即奋不顾身地赶去将小孩推向路边，而自己却被电车碰伤。他们的共产主义高贵品质，得到群众的赞扬。群众称他们是“毛主席的好警察”。（附图片）
