Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, May 26th: Cambodian Acting Prime Minister Son Sann said on the 25th that Cambodia's neutral policy is in line with the Geneva Accords and Cambodia's tradition.

According to an official statement, Son Sann made these remarks when discussing Cambodia's foreign policy in parliament. He added that Cambodia's neutral policy has been successful, but it does not suit the wishes of certain governments, especially those of certain neighboring countries. Let these neighbors forever believe that the opportunity for them to change the Cambodian regime and its neutral policy again has been lost.

Son Sann said that Cambodia will resolutely combat all foreign infiltration into Cambodian territory. It cannot accept South Vietnam's proposal for joint military operations on the border, because such action would be tantamount to a military alliance. He also said that the United States is trying its best to bring Cambodia and South Vietnam together.

Son Sann also said that the U.S. government has repeatedly assured that it respects Cambodia's neutral policy and supports Sihanouk's government and Cambodia's independence.

Referring to Cambodia's relations with its neighbors, Son Sann said that Cambodia's relations with Thailand have improved somewhat. Cambodia has requested the Thai government to give a correct answer regarding the issue of Cambodian traitors. Son Sann announced that the Thai Foreign Minister will visit Cambodia, and Prime Minister Sihanouk has also invited the Thai Prime Minister to visit Cambodia.

Son Sann also mentioned his upcoming visit to Laos.

The Acting Prime Minister said that Cambodia and France will soon negotiate a trade and payment agreement, and perhaps also a cultural agreement.

Son Sann announced that Indonesian President Sukarno will visit Cambodia on June 18th, and the two countries have already signed a treaty of friendship. He also said that President Nasser of the United Arab Republic has invited Prime Minister Sihanouk to visit Cairo in June this year.

    柬埔寨代理首相讲话
    重申柬埔寨执行中立政策
    拒绝南越提出联合军事行动的建议
    新华社金边26日电  柬埔寨代理首相松山在25日说，柬埔寨的中立政策是符合日内瓦协议和柬埔寨的传统的。
    据官方发表的一项声明，松山是在议会中谈柬埔寨外交政策时说这番话的，他又说，柬埔寨的中立政策是成功的，但是不合某些政府的心意，特别是某些邻国的心意。让这些邻国永远相信，他们要想再次改变柬埔寨政权和它的中立政策的时机已经失去了。
    松山说，柬埔寨要坚决打击一切外国对柬埔寨领土的渗入，它不能接受南越提出的关于在边境上采取联合军事行动的建议，因为这种行动就等于是军事联盟。他又说，美国正在竭力使柬埔寨和南越搞在一起。
    松山还说，美国政府曾经一再保证，它尊重柬埔寨的中立政策，并且支持西哈努克的政府和柬埔寨的独立。
    在谈到柬埔寨同邻国的关系时，松山说，柬埔寨同泰国的关系已经好了一些，柬埔寨曾经要求泰国政府就有关柬埔寨的卖国贼问题给予正确的回答。松山宣布，泰国外交部长将访问柬埔寨，西哈努克首相还邀请了泰国总理访问柬埔寨。
    松山还谈到他最近将去老挝访问。
    这位代理首相说，柬埔寨同法国不久将就签订一项贸易和支付协定、也许还就签订一项文化协定进行谈判。
    松山宣布，印度尼西亚苏加诺总统将在6月18日访问柬埔寨，两国已经签订了一项友好的条约。他又说，阿拉伯联合共和国纳赛尔总统邀请了西哈努克首相在今年6月访问开罗。
