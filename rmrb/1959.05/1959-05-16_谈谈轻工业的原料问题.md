Let's Talk About Raw Material Problems in Light Industry
郑戈桓

Since the Great Leap Forward, industrial and agricultural production has developed rapidly, people's incomes have increased, and their lives have improved accordingly. Light industry production, which reflects social needs, has also grown. In the first quarter of this year, many products have increased significantly compared with the same period last year. Fountain pens increased by more than 80%, pencils and alcohol increased by more than 40%, paper, sugar, and edible vegetable oil increased by more than 30%, and other products such as crude salt, cigarettes, and soap also had varying degrees of growth. With the growth of production, the demand for raw materials and materials naturally increases greatly.

Since a considerable part of the raw materials for light industry comes from agriculture, agricultural production is limited by seasonality. Before the agricultural harvest season arrives, it is difficult to fully meet the raw material needs for light industry products. In addition, some of the chemical raw materials required by light industry are also required by the metallurgical industry. Light industry must temporarily give these raw materials to industries that occupy a dominant position in the current national economy, such as mining, coal washing, coking, steel rolling, power stations, irrigation and drainage, and the manufacturing of locomotive vehicles, so as to enable them to develop rapidly and pave the way for light industry to obtain abundant production equipment.

Therefore, the increase in raw materials and materials for light industry always lags behind the needs of production within a certain period. This is an objective difficulty in our light industry production. How should we deal with this problem? Should we subjectively do nothing and allow these objective difficulties to dominate us? Absolutely not, and it is not allowed. We still have great subjective initiative to play in the issue of raw materials, great potential to tap, and much to do. At present, in addition to strengthening the organizational leadership work of administrative departments, such as light industry leading departments at all levels earnestly helping various provinces, cities, and enterprises to implement the supply of raw materials, quickly issue the indicators that have been verified and allocated by the state, and organize their orders and supervise and inspect their timely delivery; supervise and inspect the implementation of the inter-provincial and inter-departmental raw material allocation plans, and earnestly arrange short-distance transportation; pay attention to the priorities in the allocation of raw materials, and use the existing raw materials in the most urgent places, etc., the most critical measure is to carry out a mass movement of technical innovation and technical revolution centered on increasing production and practicing economy, and to overcome the difficulties of raw materials in every possible way, expand the source of raw materials, and create conditions for increasing production.

It should be admitted that there is great potential to be tapped in raw materials for light industry.

This is first reflected in the large differences in the use of raw materials between advanced and backward units. If this difference is narrowed, so that the backward catch up with the advanced and the advanced become more advanced, production can be increased immediately. For example, in the papermaking industry, some factories use more than 1,200 kilograms of pulp to produce one ton of offset printing paper, while advanced factories use only more than 800 kilograms. The former uses 50% more pulp than the latter. If the pulp consumption of the national papermaking industry is reduced by 10%, the country can produce 200,000 tons more paper a year. For example, in the papermaking industry, taking sulfate wood pulp as an example, some factories use more than 200 kilograms of alkali per ton of sulfate wood pulp, but some factories use up to 300 kilograms of alkali, which is one-third more. If it drops to more than 200 kilograms, the country can save nearly 10,000 tons of alkali a year. There are also many examples in the rubber industry. For example, the consumption of rubber for each pair of large-sized long ball rubber shoes is generally 180 grams, but the advanced units are only 160 grams, which is 20 grams lower. If the rubber consumption of all rubber shoes reaches the advanced consumption quota, the country can produce more than 20 million pairs of rubber shoes. In other light industry departments such as cigarettes, sugar making, oil, alcohol, soap, canned food, leather, hardware processing, and matches, there is also great potential in the consumption quota of raw materials. As long as the work of saving is carried out seriously, it is possible to achieve the goal of increasing production.

In terms of comprehensive utilization, taking substitutes, and recycling waste products, it is also an important source of tapping the potential of raw materials. Generally speaking, it is not easy to use substitutes for the raw materials of food industry products such as sugar, salt, alcoholic beverages, canned meat products, fish meal, oil, egg products, and dairy products. However, there is great potential in the comprehensive utilization of these products. In the processing of these products, one component is absorbed, and another component is discarded. It is these discarded "wastes" that become valuable raw materials when producing another product; or in the processing process, they only have one use in a certain form, and another use in another form. There are many such examples. For example, we all know that sugar cane is the raw material for sugar making and papermaking; however, the waste molasses after sugar making can be fermented to make alcohol, acetic acid, acetone, butanol, lactic acid, citric acid, glycerin, yeast, dry ice, potassium salt ash, etc.; filter mud can first extract sugarcane wax, and then make granular fertilizer. For example, fish meal processing plants not only use the animal protein of fish to make fish meal for human consumption, but also fish heads, fish tails, fish bones, fish bellies, rotten fish, and small fish that cannot be eaten can be made into the most nutritious feed for livestock and poultry. For example, rice bran cake, cottonseed cake, and feed grain can all be used to make wine first, and then feed, and so on. Comprehensive utilization can not only make the best use of everything, increase new varieties, reduce costs, greatly increase equipment utilization, improve labor productivity, but also promote the improvement of the technical level of light industry production, and lay a good foundation for the adoption of new technologies to produce light industry products.

In terms of recycling waste materials and substitutes, the most meaningful thing to promote at present is the substitution and recycling of chemical raw materials, especially "two alkalis." "Two alkalis" are widely used in light industry, especially in the papermaking industry, which consumes one-quarter of the country's annual production of caustic soda a year, so it is important to pay attention to saving alkali in this regard. At present, in the pulp production of the papermaking industry, graded cooking is adopted, and lime is used to replace part of the caustic soda, which can save 50% of the alkali consumption; similarly, the Shanghai light industry department recovers the alkaline slag of the steelmaking industry, crushes it, soaks it, and passes in steam and other simple processing processes, it can obtain alkali liquor to manufacture rice straw pulp, which can save 30% of the alkali consumption. Other methods, such as using grass and wood ash, using indigenous methods to recycle waste liquid from papermaking factories and printing and dyeing factories, or directly steaming and cooking waste liquid to make thatch pulp, or using mirabilite, native alkali, etc., are worth continuing to test and promote. As for purchasing waste products from urban residents through commercial departments, such as waste paper, waste hemp, rags, waste wool, waste rubber, old toothpaste tubes, waste plastic products, etc., it is also an important source of solving raw materials.

It needs to be pointed out that the quality of light industry products is a problem. Due to the poor quality of some products, a lot of waste is caused. For example, some paper mills pursue the weight of paper, so that the thickness greatly exceeds the standard, but the effective use area of the paper is greatly reduced. Therefore, it is necessary to criticize the idea and practice of opposing saving and quality. Saving raw materials must ensure quality at the same time, and ensuring quality must also pay attention to saving raw materials at the same time. Adhering to this practice will definitely be conducive to increasing production.

The development of raw material industries lagging behind the development of processing industries is only a temporary phenomenon. If each light industry enterprise actively and as much as possible produces a part of raw materials by itself, it can also solve a part of the problem. For example, in order to solve the shortage of caustic soda and bleaching powder in this region and industry, all large cities with electricity use the time of low load every day (about a dozen hours a day) to install electrolytic cells and other necessary equipment for the production of caustic soda and bleaching powder, which can solve part of the needs of caustic soda and bleaching powder. Others can use "foreign methods" if they can, and can use "combination of indigenous and foreign methods" if they can. Everything is determined according to specific conditions. Small-scale indigenous or foreign-made factories that have already been established should be continuously consolidated and improved, so that they can pass the "technical barrier" well, thereby increasing the yield, reducing the consumption of raw materials and fuels, improving labor productivity, and reducing costs.

With the continuous progress of technology, the potential within enterprises is endless, and it must not be considered that the potential has been exhausted. The key to mobilizing the potential hidden in enterprises is how to seriously launch a mass movement of technical innovation and technical revolution.

Firmly believe in the power of the masses, closely rely on and mobilize their labor enthusiasm and pioneering spirit, and we will surely be able to overcome difficulties and complete and overfulfill the national plan. (Attached picture)

    谈谈轻工业的原料问题
    郑戈桓
    大跃进以来，工农业生产有了飞跃的发展，人民的收入增加，生活也相应地改善，反映社会需要的轻工业生产也增长了，今年第一季度许多产品与去年同期比较增长很大。金笔增长80％以上，铅笔、酒精增长40％以上，纸张、食糖、食用植物油增长30％以上，其他如原盐、卷烟、肥皂等都有不同程度的增长。随着生产的增长，原料和材料的需求量自然也就大大增长。
  由于轻工业的原料有相当大的一部分来自农业，农业生产是有季节性限制的，在农业收获季节没有到来以前，轻工业产品需要的原料是难以做到完全满足的。另外，轻工业产品需用的一部分化工原料，同时也是冶金工业所需用的原料，轻工业必需暂时把这部分原料让给那些在当前国民经济中占主导地位的工业，如采矿、洗煤、炼焦、轧钢、电站、排灌和机车车辆等设备的制造业，从而使它们迅速发展，为轻工业获得充裕的生产设备开拓道路。
    所以，轻工业原料材料的增长在一定的时期内，总是赶不上生产需要的。这就是我们轻工业生产中存在的一个客观困难。怎样对待这个问题呢？我们是否在主观上就无可作为，听任这些客观困难摆布呢？绝不应该这样，也不允许这样。我们在原料材料问题上还有很大的主观能动性可以发挥，还有很大的潜力可以挖掘，还大有可为。目前除了加强行政部门的组织领导工作，例如各级轻工业领导部门切实帮助各省市各企业的原料材料供应问题落实，迅速下达业经国家核定分配的指标，并组织其订货和督促检查其及时交货；督促检查省际间部门间的原料材料调拨计划的执行，并切实安排短途交通运输；在原材料的分配上注意轻重缓急，把现有的原材料用到最急需的地方等等以外，最关键的措施就是开展以增产节约为中心的技术革新和技术革命的群众运动，千方百计克服原料材料困难，扩大原料材料的来源，为增加生产创造条件。
    应当承认，目前轻工业原料材料是有很大的潜力可挖的。
    这首先表现在先进单位和落后单位在原料材料使用上存在着很大差别，如果缩小这种差别，使落后赶上先进，先进的更加先进，就能马上增加产量。例如在造纸工业中生产一吨胶版印刷纸，有的工厂要用一千二百多公斤的纸浆，而先进的工厂只用八百多公斤，前者比后者多用了50％的纸浆。如果全国造纸工业用浆量都降低10％，全国一年就可多增产二十万吨纸。又如造纸工业中用碱量，以硫酸盐木浆为例，有的工厂每吨硫酸盐木浆用碱二百多公斤，但有的工厂用碱达到三百多公斤，多了三分之一，如果下降到二百多公斤，全国一年就可节约将近一万吨碱。在橡胶工业中的例子也是很多的。如每双大号长球胶鞋耗用橡胶量一般是一百八十克，但先进单位只是一百六十克，低了二十克，如果所有胶鞋用胶量都达到先进的消耗定额，全国就可增产胶鞋二千多万双。其他如卷烟、制糖、油脂、酒精、肥皂、食品罐头、皮革、五金加工、火柴等轻工业部门，在原料消耗定额上都同样存在很大潜力，只要认真进行节约工作，就有可能达到增产的目的。
    在综合利用，采取代用品，回收废品方面，也是发掘原料材料潜力的重要来源之一。一般地说，食品工业产品如食糖、食盐、饮料酒、罐头肉品、鱼粉、油脂、蛋品、乳品等产品的原料是不好用代用品的，但是在这些产品的综合利用方面，则具有很大的潜力。这些产品在加工过程中，某一成份被吸收，另一种成份则被排弃，正是这些被排弃的“废物”，在生产另一种产品时又成为贵重的原料；或者在加工过程中只在一定形态下有这样的一种用途，在另一形态下又有另一种用途。这些事例是很多的。例如我们所熟知的甘蔗是制糖、造纸等的原料；但是制糖后的废蜜经过发酵可以制酒精、醋酸、丙酮、丁醇、乳酸、柠檬酸、甘油、酵母、干冰、钾盐灰等等；滤泥可以先提取蔗腊，然后制成颗粒肥料。又如鱼粉加工厂除利用了鱼的动物蛋白质作出人食鱼粉外，鱼头、鱼尾、鱼刺、鱼肚、烂鱼、不能吃的小鱼可以做成最有营养价值的家畜、家禽的饲料。又如米糠饼、棉子饼和饲料粮等都可先作酒，后作饲料，等等。综合利用不仅可以物尽其用，增加新的品种，降低成本，大大地提高设备利用率，提高劳动生产率，而且可以促进轻工业生产技术水平的提高，为采用新技术生产轻工业产品打下一个良好的基础。
    在回收废料和代用品方面，当前最有推广意义的是化工原料特别是“两碱”的代用和回收。“两碱”在轻工业中有广泛的用途，特别是造纸工业，它一年的用碱量就占全国烧碱年产量的四分之一，因而在这方面注意节约用碱是有重要意义的。目前造纸工业的纸浆生产中采用分级蒸煮，用石灰代替一部分烧碱，可节约用碱量50％；同样，上海轻工业部门把炼钢工业的碱性炉渣加以回收，粉碎、浸渍，通入蒸汽等简单处理过程，就能得到碱液用以制造稻草浆，就能节约用碱量30％。其他如利用草木灰，对造纸厂、印染厂的废液采用土法回收，或直接将废液蒸煮斯茅草浆，或利用芒硝、土碱等等，都是值得继续试验和推广的。至于通过商业部门向城市居民收购废品，如废纸、废麻、破布、废毛、废胶、旧牙膏瓶、废塑料制品等等，也是解决原料的一个重要来源。
    需要提出的是轻工业产品的质量问题。由于某些产品质量不好，造成很大浪费。例如有些纸厂追求纸张重量，以致厚度大大超过标准，但是纸张的有效使用面积大大减少了。因此必须批判那些把节约和质量对立起来的想法和作法，节约原料材料必须同时保证质量，保证质量也必须同时注意节约原料材料，坚持这个做法，就一定会有利于增加生产。
    原料工业的发展跟不上加工工业的发展只是一种暂时现象，各个轻工业企业如果主动地积极地尽可能地自己进行一部分原材料的生产，也可以解决一部分问题。例如为了解决本地区本行业烧碱和漂白粉的不足，一切有电力的大城市利用每天低负荷的时间（每天大约有十几个钟头）安装电解槽等必要设备进行烧碱和漂白粉的生产，就能解决一部分烧碱和漂白粉的需要。其他能用“洋法”则用“洋法”，能用“土洋结合”则用“土洋结合”。一切根据具体条件决定。已经搞起来的小型土法或洋法生产的工厂要不断巩固、提高它们，使它们能够过好“技术关”，从而增加收得率，降低原料材料、燃料的消耗，提高劳动生产率，降低成本。
    随着技术的不断进步，企业内部的潜力是无穷无尽的，决不能认为潜力已经挖尽了。动员企业内部蕴藏着的潜力的关键在于如何认真展开一个群众性的技术革新和技术革命运动。
    坚决地相信广大群众的力量，紧紧地依靠和动员他们的劳动积极性和首创精神，就一定能够战胜困难，完成和超额完成国家计划。（附图片）
