Xinhua News Agency, 3rd -- People in urban and rural areas across the country continue to angrily condemn imperialism and Indian interventionists. From the Greater Khingan Range to the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau, from the southeast coast to the north and south of the Tianshan Mountains, people of all nationalities have held meetings and posted big-character posters in recent days, denouncing imperialism and Indian expansionists for interfering in our country's internal affairs and instigating the Tibetan reactionary group to carry out rebellion, expressing the common will of 650 million people to resolutely defend the unification of the motherland and the solidarity of all nationalities.

    In the north of the motherland, Heilongjiang Province, inhabited by twelve ethnic groups, people of all ethnic groups held meetings to protest against imperialism and foreign reactionaries for interfering in our country's internal affairs. The workers of Hegang Coal Mine, the forestry workers in the Lesser Khingan Range forest area, the Oroqen people who have only just leaped from primitive hunting life to a socialist happy life, and the Hezhe people who were almost exterminated by Japanese imperialism before liberation, have expressed great indignation at the shameless acts of Indian expansionists in undermining the solidarity of all ethnic groups in our country.

    In Anshan, Dalian, and other ten cities and forty-two counties in Liaoning Province, as well as in various parts of Jilin Province, people of all ethnic groups have expressed increasingly strong anger at the shameless conspiracies of imperialism and Indian expansionists to interfere in our country's internal affairs. Iron and steel workers in Anshan wrote many big-character posters during their intense labor, pointing out that Indian Prime Minister Nehru distorted the facts in his speech, tried his best to defend the Tibetan rebels who harmed the people and betrayed the motherland, and attacked our country, which has seriously threatened the friendly relations between China and India and the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. Artists in Andong City immediately held a meeting to protest after seeing cartoons in Indian reactionary newspapers insulting our great leader. They said: Indian expansionists slander us for suppressing the rebellion as barbarians, which is really slanderous. The barbarians are precisely those rebels who are colluding with them and committing all kinds of evils.

    In the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, from the Hulunbuir Grassland, Baotou Iron and Steel Base to the Hetao area of the Yellow River, workers, farmers, students, and others of all ethnic groups have held continuous meetings, posted big-character posters and slogans, and severely condemned the provocative behavior of Indian expansionists.

    In the north and south of the Tianshan Mountains in the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, people of all ethnic groups have sternly warned Indian expansionists that they must immediately stop their conspiracy activities. Tens of thousands of oil workers of all ethnic groups in Karamay have been condemning the Indian interventionists for days, pointing out: The Chinese people who have stood up are not to be bullied. Tursun and Niyaz, Uygur drillers from the drilling team, said: From our own experience, we deeply realize that all ethnic groups must unite closely in order to develop together, and we will never allow anyone to undermine our great family of ethnic groups that are united and harmonious in our motherland.

    People of all ethnic groups in Qinghai and Gansu provinces and the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region have continued to hold meetings in recent days to denounce the shameless behavior of Indian expansionists in interfering in our country's internal affairs.

    The broad masses of peasants in the Guanzhong Plain, the mountainous areas of southern Shaanxi, and the Loess Plateau in northern Shaanxi Province angrily protested against the provocations of the Indian reactionaries. When the workers and peasants in Yan'an heard the news that Indian reactionaries had insulted Chairman Mao, the leader of the Chinese people, they were filled with righteous indignation. They said that the Bombay Police Bureau in India condoned the reactionary elements insulting our Chairman Mao, which is an insult to the people of the whole country, and it is intolerable.

    The workers of the Qinhuangdao Power Plant in Hebei Province, after holding a forum, jointly wrote a letter to the Qinhuangdao Daily saying: "We warn those Indian expansionists who have lost their minds, it is better to wake up a bit. Today's China is no longer the China ruled by the Qing Dynasty, the Northern Warlords, or the Kuomintang reactionaries. The Chinese people who have stood up are not to be bullied!"

    Tens of thousands of forums and countless big-character posters and blackboard newspapers in various parts of Henan Province have concentratedly reflected the anger of the broad masses of people towards the Indian interventionists.

    The fire of opposing the Indian interventionists' interference in our country's internal affairs has spread throughout the Yangtze River Basin. The people of Sichuan, Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi and other provinces have held forums and meetings, unanimously denouncing the conspiracies of imperialism and Indian expansionists to plot the Tibetan rebellion and to be enemies of the Chinese people. Luo Yongfa, a steelmaking worker at the Daye Steel Plant in Hubei, said: "Any support from foreigners for the armed rebels in Tibet is interference in our country's internal affairs and an infringement on our country's sovereignty. Our working class will never allow it!" Cai Xuezhao, a demobilized soldier from the Xianfeng County Machinery Factory in the Enshi mountainous area, said with excitement: I am a demobilized soldier and once contributed to the peaceful liberation of Tibet. Now, the Indian expansionists are actually instigating the Tibetan rebellion and clamoring for "Tibetan independence," trying to split our country's territory. I firmly disagree.

    People in various parts of Jiangxi Province have held meetings for days to condemn imperialism and Indian interventionists. In Nanchang City alone, more than 200,000 workers participated in the forums.

    In the vast towns and rural areas of the southeastern coastal areas of our country, workers and farmers have severely condemned the provocative behavior of Indian expansionists.

    People's communes in Fujian Province have held forums or written protest letters to condemn the Indian interventionists. Representatives of the She ethnic group and people from all walks of life in Fuan County also held a forum. They used their personal experiences to explain that only by closely uniting in the great family of the motherland can ethnic minorities obtain equality, freedom, and happiness, and completely change the backward and poor state left over from history. We firmly oppose the Indian expansionists colluding with a handful of reactionary elements in Tibet in an attempt to undermine the unity and unification of our great family of ethnic groups.

    Almost all factories, mines, and people's communes in Shandong Province have held forums or protest rallies against imperialism and Indian expansionists for interfering in our country's internal affairs. Corridors in many institutions and factories, as well as streets, are filled with big-character posters denouncing the interventionists. The editorial departments of newspapers in the province and various counties and cities receive a large number of letters from readers every day, angrily denouncing and solemnly warning the interventionists.

    The people in small and medium-sized towns and the broad masses of peasants in Zhejiang and Jiangsu provinces have expressed their determination to resolutely counter the provocations of Indian expansionists in interfering in our country's internal affairs.

    On the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau, the situation is also filled with righteous indignation, and people of all ethnic groups are angrily denouncing the serious provocations of Indian expansionists. Ethnic cadres in the Guizhou Provincial and Municipal organs held a forum. Huang Huanmin (Zhuang nationality), Deputy Director of the Provincial Nationalities Affairs Commission, and Yang Boyao (Yi nationality) pointed out in their speeches: Indian expansionists support the Tibetan traitorous group, launch vicious attacks against our country, and vainly attempt to undermine our country's unification and continue to maintain their past privileges in Tibet, which is absolutely impossible.

    People from all ethnic groups and all walks of life in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region and Guangdong Province in southern China are also continuing to hold rallies to condemn imperialism and Indian interventionists. (Attached picture)
