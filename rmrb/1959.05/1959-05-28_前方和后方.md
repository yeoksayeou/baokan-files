    Front and Rear
    Wu Lü
    In war, there is a front and a rear. An empty rear, "having worries about the rear," is what commanders fear most. During the Warring States period, Sun Bin's strategy of "besieging Wei to rescue Zhao" seized upon the weakness of the Wei state, whose elite troops had been sent out in full force, leaving the rear empty, and achieved victory. During the Battle of Guandu in the Three Kingdoms period, Yuan Shao was defeated because he did not heed Xu You's advice, failing to take advantage of the weakness to attack Xu Chang and disrupt Cao Cao's rear. Instead, Cao Cao burned Yuan Shao's grain supplies at Wuchao, leading to a collapse of morale and a complete defeat.
    Although factory production is different from warfare, it also has a front and a rear. If production is the front, then supply is the rear; if the main workshop is the front, then the tool workshop, machine repair workshop, and other auxiliary workshops are the rear. The rear is the base for the front. Doing a good job in the rear is an important condition for ensuring victory in front-line production. Taking a machinery factory as an example, to achieve high quality and high output, one must first prepare a set of standard tools, maintain good technical performance of machinery and equipment, analyze and test various raw materials, and inspect and calibrate the accuracy of various measuring tools. These are usually referred to as technical rear work. If the rear work is not done well—tools are not up to standard, machinery and equipment do not operate smoothly, raw materials do not meet specifications, and measuring tools are inaccurate—then victory in front-line production will be difficult to achieve.
    This flesh-and-blood relationship between the rear and the front is not difficult to understand. However, in practice, some comrades often neglect the work in the rear. When they arrange production tasks, they often do not consider the time for tool design and manufacturing; when rushing to meet tasks, they do not carry out repairs when the machinery and equipment are due for maintenance, and even transfer the equipment and workers from the machine repair workshop to the front, simply canceling the work in the rear. In their view, the division between front and rear is only possible in ordinary times, and at this time of the Great Leap Forward, they cannot attend to so much. These comrades are of course well-intentioned, for the victory of front-line production. We should also admit that when tasks are urgent, it is necessary to make some adjustments to the strength of each workshop. However, this does not mean that the work in the rear is dispensable, let alone that the work in the rear can be cancelled when the front-line tasks are urgent. The division between front and rear is not a subjective idea of anyone, but an objective existence. Production always requires the use of tools, and equipment always needs to be maintained and repaired; the more urgent the front-line production tasks, the more the work in the rear must be strengthened. Just imagine: the production tasks are tight, the need for tools is great, and the wear and tear of machines is high. In this case, if we do not strengthen the rear but weaken it, or even cancel the work in the rear, how can we achieve victory in front-line production?
    Comrades who neglect the work in the rear often put the work in the rear in opposition to the front-line production, failing to understand that strengthening the work in the rear is precisely to support the front-line production. If the work in the rear is done well, the front-line production can be in an active position, so as not to fight unprepared battles. "Do not fight unprepared battles," this is an important working method that Comrade Mao Zedong often taught us. In war, not fighting unprepared battles means concentrating forces, replenishing ammunition, and preparing and transporting food and grass, all of which rely on the support of the rear. In production, not fighting unprepared battles means doing a series of technical and material production preparation work, which is to strengthen the rear. Fighting unprepared in war, rushing into battle, always leads to failure. Production without preparation, rushing into battle, will also always fail.
    Today, this newspaper published news about the Tianjin Forging Press Factory strengthening the technical rear to ensure the realization of high quality and high output. Their proposal to strengthen the technical rear is worthy of attention. Now, factories and mines across the country are striving for high quality and high output, and strengthening the work in the rear is also an urgent task.

### 前方和后方

    前方和后方
    吴滤
    打仗有前方和后方。后方空虚，“有后顾之忧”，是带兵最忌讳的事情。战国时，孙膑用“围魏救赵”之计，就是抓住了魏国精锐部队倾巢而出，后方空虚的弱点，取得胜利的。三国时官渡之战，袁绍大败，是败在不纳许攸之谋，没有乘虚袭许昌，扰曹操的后方，反被曹操烧了乌巢的粮草，以致军心大乱，一败涂地。
    工厂的生产虽然同打仗不同，但是也有前方和后方。如果说生产是前方，供应就是后方；如果说主要车间是前方，工具车间、机修车间和其他辅助车间就是后方。后方是前方的基地。搞好后方工作，是保证前方生产胜利的重要条件。拿机械工厂来说，要实现优质高产，先要准备一套标准的工具，要保持机器设备良好的技术效能，要对各种原材料进行分析化验，要检查和校正各种量具的精确性。这些，通常都称为技术后方工作。后方工作搞不好，工具不合标准，机器设备运转不灵，原材料不合规格，量具不精确，前方的生产必难取胜。
    后方同前方这种血肉相连的关系，本来是不难理解的。但是，在实践中，有些同志却常常忽视后方的工作。他们布置生产任务的时候，常常不考虑工具设计和制造的时间；赶起任务来，机器设备到了该检修的时候也不检修了，甚至把机修车间的设备和工人都调到前方去，干脆取消了后方的工作。在他们看来，划分前方后方，只有在平常的时候才有可能，值此大跃进之际，就顾不得这许多了。这些同志当然也是好心，是为了前方生产的胜利。我们也应该承认，在任务紧急的时候，各个车间的力量作一些调整是必要的。但是，这决不是说后方工作就是可有可无的了，更不是说前方任务紧急，后方工作就可以取消了。前方和后方的划分，并不是哪一个人主观上的设想，而是一种客观存在。生产总是要使用工具的，设备总是要维护检修的；前方生产任务愈紧，后方工作愈要加强。试想：生产任务紧，工具的需要多，机器的磨损大，在这种情况下，不加强后方，反而削弱后方，甚至取消后方的工作，难道能够得到前方生产的胜利吗？
    忽视后方工作的同志，往往把后方工作同前方生产对立起来，不了解加强后方工作正是为了支援前方生产。后方工作搞好了，前方生产才能立于主动地位，不致打无准备之仗。“不打无准备之仗”，这是毛泽东同志经常教导我们的一种重要的工作方法。在战争中不打无准备之仗，就要集中兵力，补充弹药，筹运粮草，这些都有赖于后方的支援。在生产中不打无准备之仗，就要做好技术上和物质上一系列的生产准备工作，这些就是加强后方。打仗无准备，慌忙应战，总是打不好的。生产无准备，仓卒上阵，也总是搞不好的。
    今天本报发表了天津锻压机床厂加强技术后方，保证实现优质高产的新闻。他们提出加强技术后方的问题很值得重视。现在全国各厂矿都力争优质高产，加强后方工作也是当务之急。
