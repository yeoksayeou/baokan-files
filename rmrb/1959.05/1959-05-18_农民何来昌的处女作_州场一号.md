Farmer He Laichang's Debut Work "Zhou Chang No. 1"

Farmer He Laichang's debut work, "Zhou Chang No. 1," has been published by Jiangxi People's Publishing House.

"Zhou Chang No. 1" is a rich agricultural science and technology book. The entire book is divided into four parts. The first part describes the origins of cultivating "Zhou Chang No. 1" and the naming of the variety. The second part specifically details the hybridization techniques used to cultivate the "Zhou Chang No. 1" variety. The third part introduces the process of cultivating the "Zhou Chang No. 1" rice variety in detail. The fourth part describes how to further improve the already cultivated single-season early indica "Zhou Chang No. 1" to cultivate it into a more perfect high-quality rice variety. Finally, an appendix includes a comparison table of the characteristics of "Zhou Chang No. 1" with its parent strains.

He Laichang is a junior high school graduate who responded to the Party's call in 1955 to return home and participate in agricultural production. He is currently the first director of the Zhou Chang work area of the Junling People's Commune in Huichang County, Jiangxi Province. Over the past few years, with the education of the Party and the help of the masses, he has created many amazing miracles in agricultural technological innovation. Through repeated experiments and research, he has cultivated the two-season early indica "Zhou Chang No. 1" high-quality rice variety. This variety, after scientific identification and production practice, has been proven to increase production by 30%-50% and has received great attention from agricultural workers across the country. The author wrote in the preface to "Zhou Chang No. 1": "Before writing this booklet, I received more than 5,000 letters from all over the country asking me to tell them about the process of cultivating the two-season early indica 'Zhou Chang No. 1' rice variety." In this situation, He Laichang, a farmer with only a junior high school education, relied on the help and support of the Party organization, broke with superstition, and spent only two months of his spare time to write this book.

    农民何来昌的处女作“州场一号”
    农民何来昌的处女作“州场一号”，已由江西人民出版社出版了。
    “州场一号”是一本内容丰富的农业科学技术读物。全书分四部分，第一部分是写培育“州场一号”的起因和品种的定名；第二部分是专门写培育“州场一号”品种的杂交技术；第三部分详细地介绍了培育“州场一号”水稻品种的经过情况；第四部分是写如何进一步改良已培育成的一季早籼“州场一号”，把它培育成为一个更完美的水稻优良品种。最后，附有“州场一号”的性状和与父母本的比较表。
    何来昌是1955年响应党的号召，回家参加农业生产的高小毕业生。现在是江西省会昌县筠岭人民公社州场作业区的第一主任。几年来，在党的教育和群众的帮助下，他在农业技术革新中创造了许多惊人的奇迹，经过反复的试验研究，育成了二季早籼“州场一号”水稻优良品种。这个品种经过科学鉴定和生产实践的证明，能够增产30％—50％，获得了全国各地农业工作者的极大重视。作者在“州场一号”一书的前言中写道：“在写这本小册子以前，我曾接到来自全国各地的五千多封来信，要求我把培育二季早籼‘州场一号’水稻品种的经过告诉他们。”在这种情况下，只具有高小文化水平的农民何来昌，依靠党组织的帮助和支持，破除迷信，仅用两个多月的业余时间，写成了这本书。
