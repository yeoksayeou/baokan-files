    The Most Enchanting Scenery
    By Our Correspondent Jin Sha
    In southern Zhejiang, there are many enchanting sights: the highway on Tiantai Mountain, the orange groves along both banks of the Chengjiang River, the fishing boats of Haimen... However, the most enchanting sight is not these, but the scene of the people of Huangyan County struggling to win their second bumper harvest this year.
    Experts Everywhere
    In a large courtyard, twenty or thirty women are seated around square tables, using their nimble fingers to sort grains of rice. Grains that are not full enough or are discolored are picked out. What remains are grains of uniform size and color. This could not help but arouse my surprise: what is this for? Just then, Li Zanqing, the deputy director of the Seed Breeding Farm of the Luqiao Commune, who was accompanying me on the tour, seemed to have guessed my thoughts, picked up a small handful of rice and said: "This is grain selection!"
    Grain selection is one of the "seven checkpoints" for seed selection in Huangyan County. All rice seeds that have not undergone pre-selection in the fields must pass this checkpoint. This is not an easy checkpoint to pass. Taking the Improved Seed Breeding Farm (equivalent to a management area) as an example, this year it needs to select more than 35,000 jin of rice seeds, and calculating 30,000 grains per jin, there are nearly 700 million grains. To check so many grains one by one will of course take a lot of labor. However, last year's experience proved that it is worthwhile to spend some labor on this. Last year, this farm had a plot of land (two mu), with the same seeds, the same fertilizer, and the same cultivation, but because one mu of seeds had passed the "seven checkpoints" and one mu of seeds had not undergone the grain selection "checkpoint", there were different yields. The one that had undergone grain selection yielded 1,042 jin, and the one that had not undergone grain selection yielded 896 jin. This means that according to this year's planting plan for the Seed Breeding Farm, 898 mu of early rice and 950 mu of late rice, after grain selection, can increase production by 180,000 jin; otherwise, it will reduce production by 180,000 jin. Therefore, after rationally arranging the labor force, this farm is determined to select all the seeds that need to be selected.
    These women used to worry about this work, which is similar to embroidery. However, after a period of learning and practice, they are now skilled and have become "seed selection experts." Now, when these people pick up a grain of rice, they can tell you: this is the "Lucaihao" variety, characterized by: round grain, pointed tip, awnless, with purplish-red color; or this is the "Xiongjiao" variety, pointed tip, without purplish-red color...
    Back in the office, Li Zanqing glanced at the improved seed planting distribution map of the farm on the wall, and a contented smile appeared on his honest and simple face. Yes, this year the Seed Breeding Farm's 800 or 900 mu of early rice are entirely using various improved varieties and have undergone grain selection, which has prepared an important condition for even greater harvests... Before the reporter could think about it, Li Zanqing started talking. He said, "This year, not only the Seed Breeding Farm is using various improved varieties, but other management areas and other communes are also using improved varieties." Isn't this the question I wanted to raise? At this time, Li Zanqing continued: "Among the improved varieties used by the Seed Breeding Farm this year, Lucaihao accounts for 70%. This is because after two years of trials in the previous year and last year, it has been proven that Lucaihao is most suitable for early planting. This variety matures early, has strong disease resistance, is not afraid of lodging, and has a higher yield than other varieties." Speaking of this, Li Zanqing paused and said, "Lucaihao is not without its shortcomings. It must be harvested quickly after maturity, otherwise it will drop grains in the field. Therefore, we plant some Nantehao and Nonglin No. 16 in combination." Then, Li Zanqing talked endlessly about various issues related to seeds. Now, the person sitting in front of me is no longer the taciturn old farmer I had just seen, but a talkative seed expert. There are such experts everywhere. With so many such experts, this year's even greater bumper harvest in agricultural production will have more reliable strength.
    Interesting Debate
    A very interesting debate took place at a production meeting in the Xiaoyou Management Area of the Chengjiang Commune. It happened like this: when Chen Xiaoxian, the Party branch secretary of the Meili Production Team, which had the worst foundation in this management area, proposed that "the first place this year should not be other production teams, but the Meili Production Team," it sparked a debate:
    "What conditions does your Meili Team have to compete for first place?"
    "We have a lot of land, more than 400 mu. If we can harvest 100 jin more per mu, we can harvest 40,000 jin more..."
    "Having a lot of land and few people is useless."
    "There are few people, but the enthusiasm is not small; with enthusiasm, anything can be done well!"...
    This debate was like a gust of wind rising from the flat ground, stirring up even bigger waves on the originally not-so-calm river. Similar debates were unfolding in every corner, especially within the Meili Production Team. Within the Meili Production Team, not everyone admitted that they could catch up with the advanced teams. Although many people no longer said that this was predetermined, they believed that the land and other conditions of the Meili Team determined that it would inevitably fall behind other teams. The first question of the debate was whether the Meili Production Team could continue to leap forward on the basis of last year. By presenting facts and reasoning, it was proven that it was entirely possible to take another step forward this year. The Third Operations Group put forward six reasons: first, the fertilizer applied to the fields last year was only 200 dan per mu, and this year we plan to apply 600 dan of fertilizer to the fields; second, the seeds sown last year were ordinary seeds, and this year 70% of the seeds sown are improved varieties such as Nante, Weiguo, and Xiongjiao; third, not much land was deep-plowed last year, and this year it has been universally plowed to more than five inches, with a few reaching eight inches; fourth, last year water was drawn entirely by human power, and this year there is a water pump, which can not only achieve timely irrigation, but also draw out a batch of labor to carry out intensive cultivation; fifth, this year's close planting is better than last year; sixth, this year, in accordance with the Central Committee's decision, the principles of graded management and distribution according to labor have been resolutely implemented, and the enthusiasm of cadres and commune members is particularly high...
    After clarifying this issue, the reasons why the advanced teams were doing well in production were analyzed. For example, the high yields of rice and oranges in the Huijiang Team are due to the fact that the land and other conditions are relatively good, but more importantly, there is more fertilizer and better cultivation. As long as the cultivation is good, coupled with raising more pigs, the yield of rice and oranges in the Meili Team can catch up with the Huijiang Team. Judging from this year's situation, the Meili Team has won three red flags because of its good cultivation. This well illustrates that as long as you work hard, strive for the upstream, you can catch up with Huijiang and surpass Huijiang.
    After the debate and analysis, the eyes of the commune members lit up. Those who originally had confidence in striving for a greater harvest now have even more confidence; those who originally had no confidence in striving to catch up with the advanced teams now also have confidence. Commune member Chen Sumei said: "Fight hard for two years and surpass Huijiang!" Chen Laoliu added: "Fight hard for one year and catch up with Huijiang!"
    In this way, the Meili Production Team began the struggle to "catch up with Huijiang and surpass Huijiang." Chen Sumei used to prune 60 orange branches a day, but now she prunes 60 branches in three hours, increasing labor efficiency by nearly two times. Hua Benhui picks up 80 jin of cow dung in one morning. In the past, he didn't pick up even one jin. Chen Youfa used to only go to the fields when others called him, but now he often calls others to go to the fields, just because he gets up earlier than others.
    Commune member Chen Miaogui wrote a big-character poster praising the enthusiasm of the commune members:
        One sun is not enough,
        Want to use stars as lamps.
        Everyone's enthusiasm soars into the sky,
        Who says advanced cannot be caught up with?
    As far as I know, it is not only the Meili Production Team of the Chengjiang Commune that has such ambitions, but also the teams with a poorer foundation in other communes also have such great ambitions.
    Icing on the Cake
    In Huangyan, you can often hear such dialogues:
    "The green manure is growing really well this year, it's the first time I've seen it!"
    "Don't say you haven't seen it, even an old man like me hasn't seen it!"
    The green manure of the Wuxing Production Team of the Chengjiang Commune is growing particularly well, half a person tall, and the stems are as thick as a little finger. In the best-growing green manure field, a child can sit in it and not show his head. According to the Party branch secretary of this team: "It is growing right now, and it can grow a few inches overnight." Because of this, there are bound to be different views on the estimated yield of these green manures. Some say:
    "At least 10,000 jin per mu!" Some say:
    "15,000 jin is guaranteed!" Others say: "No more, no less, 12,000 jin!"... Although there are different estimates, the lowest estimate is above 10,000.
    However, the owners of these fields are not satisfied. The Party branch secretary of the Wuxing Team said: "This year's grass seeds (green manure) are growing better than in previous years, but this year's early rice targets are also different from previous years. Besides, we can't just rely on green manure, we also need human manure, smoked soil..."
    Now this team is taking various measures to accumulate and make fertilizer. "Increase fertilizer by another 50 dan per mu" has become the fighting slogan of this team. This team only has five mud-dredging boats, so they have adopted the method of three shifts dredging mud with people stopping but boats not stopping. In this way, each boat can dredge six boats of mud in one day and night. Many elderly people cannot go to the fields, so they make fertilizer at home with firewood and grass. Even old ladies who never participate in labor have joined the fertilizer-making work, setting off a vigorous upsurge of accumulating and making fertilizer.
    The Party branch secretary said to me: "If the green manure is too old, it will reduce the fertilizer effect. Therefore, today (April 1st) we began to plow the green manure fields." As he said this, he took me to visit the scene of plowing the green manure fields. In a green manure field of more than ten mu, it was divided into three shifts of people. One shift was harvesting green manure, cutting the green manure, then chopping it up with knives and scattering it in the field. One shift was driving oxen to plow the land, and one shift was pumping water to irrigate the fields. What was just a green ocean has now become a black land exuding the fragrance of soil and grass. After plowing, seedlings will be transplanted within a day or two. The Party branch secretary said: This is called "plowing while transplanting." According to last year's experience, using this method can increase the yield.
    Cadres Among the Masses
    The rain has not completely stopped, and more than twenty staff members appeared on the muddy field ridges. These staff members inspected the rice seedling fields on both sides, field by field. They inspected the seedling fields where seedling rot had occurred particularly carefully. They pulled up a few seedlings, carefully observed the yellowing and reddening leaves and the rotting roots, and then inquired about the management methods. Among these staff members, there was a chubby person, who was County Chief Wang.
    Recently, seedling rot has occurred in many communes. The seedling fields managed by Hu Shouyu and Jiang Congting, two old farmers from the Luqiao Commune, have also experienced seedling rot. Judging from the management methods of this field, this phenomenon should not have occurred. After the seeds were sown, these two people spent all day in the seedling fields. If they found a piece of firewood, a leaf, or a small stone in the seedling field, they would poke it out with a bamboo pole. The management was very meticulous, like embroidery.
    However, when the seedlings grew to be more than an inch tall, seedling rot occurred. Hu Shouyu and Jiang Congting, along with company commander Tang Puding, were very anxious. What disease did the seedlings have? How did it happen? How to treat it? Not only could the local experienced farmers not answer, but also the agricultural university students who were interning locally could not answer.
    At this time, County Chief Wang came here to investigate and research, found out the reason, and put forward prevention and treatment methods.
    The next day, many production teams confidently re-sowed and raised seedlings.
    In Huangyan, you can see leading cadres like County Chief Wang everywhere. For example, Xu Renyao, the general branch secretary of the Jiazhi Brigade of the Haimen Commune, not only goes deep into production and leads production, but he himself is also a rice transplanting expert. He once competed in rice transplanting with Wang Meiyun, one of the "Seven Immortals" and a Zhejiang youth rice transplanting shock worker. Another example is Pan Xuenian, the Party branch secretary of the Zanyang Production Team of the Sanjia Commune, who not only often works with commune members, but also cares very much about the lives of commune members. If a commune member gets sick, he will go to ask about water and tea. Another example is Ying Meier, the Party branch secretary of the Advanced Team of the Chengjiang Commune, who has set a very good system for himself: participating in production during the day and working at night. If there is a problem in production, he can quickly discover it.
    It is precisely because of such good leading cadres that the enthusiasm of the commune members is guaranteed to become higher and higher.

    最迷人的景色
    本报记者　金沙
    在浙江南部，有许多迷人的景色：天坛山上的公路，澄江两岸的桔林，海门的渔船……但是，最迷人的景色，还不是这些，而是黄岩县人民正在为争取今年第二个丰收而斗争的情景。
    到处有专家
    在一个大院子内，二三十个妇女分坐在一张张方桌子的周围，正在用着灵巧的指头，拨弄着一粒粒谷子。不大饱满的或者带着杂色的谷子，被挑了出来。余下的是大小一般，颜色一般的谷子。这不由得引起了我的惊奇：这是做什么呀？正在这时，陪同我参观的路桥公社种子繁育场的副场长李赞卿，好像已经看出了我的心思，拿起一小把谷子说：“这是粒选谷种！”
    粒选，是黄岩县选种“七关”中的一关，所有没有经过田头预选的谷种，都要过这一关。这是一个不大容易过的关。拿良种繁育场（等于一个管理区）来说，今年需要经过粒选的谷种共有三万五千多斤，按每斤三万粒计算，就有近七万万粒。要把这么多粒谷子，一粒粒检查过，这当然是要花不少劳动力的。但是去年的经验证明了：在这上面花些劳动力是合算的。去年，这个场有一丘田（二亩），同样的种子，同样的肥料，同样的耕作，但因有一亩的种子过了“七关”，有一亩的种子没有经过粒选“关”，就有不同的产量。经过粒选的是一千零四十二斤，没有粒选的是八百九十六斤。这也就是说，按照今年种子繁育场的播种计划，早稻八百九十八亩，晚稻九百五十亩，经过粒选，就可增产十八万斤；反之，就会少产十八万斤。因此这个场对劳动力进行合理安排以后，决心把所有需要粒选的种子都粒选一遍。
    这些妇女对于这个同绣花一样的工作也曾发过愁。但是，经过一个时期学习和实践，现在熟练了，并且成了“选种专家”。现在这些人拿起一粒谷子，可以告诉你：这是“陆财号”品种，特征是：粒圆、嘴尖、无芒、带紫红色；或者这是“熊交”号种子，嘴尖、不带紫红色……
    回到办公室里，李赞卿看了一眼墙上的这个场的良种播种分布图，忠厚朴实的脸上，露出了得意的笑容。是的，今年种子繁育场的八九百亩早稻，完全采用了各种良种，又经过了粒选，这给更大的丰收，准备好了一个重要条件……还没有等记者去联想，李赞卿说开话了，他说：“今年不光种子繁育场选用了各种良种，就是其他管理区，其他公社，也都选用了良种。”这不就是我想提出的问题吗？这时，李赞卿又说下去：“种子繁育场今年选用的良种中，陆财号占70％。这因为经过前年、去年两年的试验，证明了陆财号最适于提早播种。这个品种早熟，抗病力强，不怕倒伏，产量比其他品种高。”说到这里，李赞卿顿了一顿说：“陆财号不是没有缺点，成熟以后必须很快收割，否则会在田间掉粒。因此，我们搭配着种点南特号，农林十六号。”接着，李赞卿滔滔不绝地说起有关种子的各种问题来。现在坐在我面前的，已不是我刚才所见到的一个沉默寡言的老农民，而是一个健谈的种子专家。这样的专家到处都有。有了许多这样的专家，今年农业生产的更大丰收就有了更可靠的力量。
    有趣的争论
    在澄江公社孝友管理区的一次生产会议上，发生了一场很有意思的争论。事情是这样发生的：当这个管理区的基础最差的美丽生产队支部书记陈小仙提出“今年的第一不应该是其他生产队，而应该是美丽生产队”的时候，就引起一场争论：　
    “你们美丽队有什么条件争到第一？”
    “地多，四百多亩地，一亩地多收一百斤，就可以多收四万斤……”
    “地多人少没有用。”
    “人是少，但是干劲不小；有了干劲，什么事都能办好！”……
    这个争论像平地卷起的一阵大风，在本来不大平静的河面上卷起了更大的波浪。——在各个角落都展开了类似的争论，特别是在美丽生产队。在美丽生产队内部，并不是所有的人都承认可以赶上先进队的，还有不少人虽然不再说这是命中注定的，但是认为美丽队的土地等条件，决定了必然要落在别的队的后边。争论的第一个问题是美丽生产队今年能不能在去年基础上继续跃进。经过摆事实，讲道理，证明了今年再前进一步是完全可能的。第三操作组就提出了六点理由：一是去年施到田里的肥料，每亩只有二百担，今年准备施到田里的肥料有六百担；二是去年播种的是一般种子，今年播种的有70％是南特、卫国、熊交等优良品种；三是去年深耕的地不多，今年普遍耕了五寸以上，少数的达到八寸；四是去年车水完全靠人力，今年有了一台抽水机，不光可以做到及时灌溉；而且可以抽出一批劳动力进行精耕细作；五是今年的密植比去年更好；六是今年按照中央决议，坚决贯彻执行了分级管理和按劳分配的原则，干部和社员的干劲特别大……
    在这个问题弄通之后，又分析了先进队生产搞得好的原因。例如汇江队水稻、柑桔产量高，一方面是土地等条件比较好，另一方面，也是最重要的，肥料多，耕作好。只要耕作好，加上多养猪，美丽队水稻、柑桔的产量，是可以赶上汇江队的。从今年的情况看，美丽队因为耕作好，已经得了三次红旗。这很好地说明了，只要鼓足干劲，力争上游，是可以赶上汇江、超过汇江的。
    经过辩论分析，社员的眼睛亮了，原来有信心争取更大丰收的，现在信心更加坚定了；原来没有信心争取赶上先进队的，现在也有信心了。社员陈思梅说：“苦战二年，超过汇江！”陈老六补充说：“苦战一年，赶上汇江！”
    这样，美丽生产队就开始了“赶汇江，超汇江”的斗争。陈思梅过去压桔枝每天是六十株，现在三个钟头就压了六十株，劳动效率提高了近两倍。华本辉一个早上拾牛粪八十斤。过去一斤也不拾。陈友法过去常常是别人叫了才上地，现在反转来常常去叫别人上地，就因为他起得比别人还早。
    社员陈妙桂写了一张大字报，歌颂社员们的干劲：
        一个太阳不够用，
        想把星星当灯点。
        个个干劲冲云霄，
        谁说先进不能赶？
    据我知道，并不仅仅澄江公社美丽生产队有这样的雄心，其他公社基础较差的队，也都抱有这样的大志。
    锦上添花
    在黄岩，经常可以听到这样的对话：
    “今年的绿肥长得真好，头一次见到！”
    “不要说你没见过，连我这样的老头也没见过！”
    澄江公社五星生产队的绿肥长得特别好，有半人高，秆子有小指头粗。在长得最好的绿肥田里，小孩子坐进去，就露不出脑袋来。据这个队的支部书记说：“现在正在长的时候，一夜可以长几寸。”正因为如此，对于这些绿肥产量的估计就难免有了不同的看法。有的说：
    “每亩至少收一万斤！”有的说：
    “一万五千斤是保险的！”也有的说：“不多不少一万二千斤！”……虽然有不同的估计，但是最低的估计也在一万以上。
    可是，这些田的主人并不满足，五星队的支部书记说：“今年的草子（绿肥）是比往年长得好，但是今年的早稻指标也不同于往年。再说，也不能光靠绿肥，还要有人粪、熏土……。”
    现在这个队正在采取各种各样的办法积肥造肥。“每亩再增加肥料五十担”已成为这个队的斗争口号。这个队只有五只捻泥船，就采取人停船不停三班轮流捻泥的方法。这样，每只船一昼夜就可捻泥六船。许多老年人不能下田，就在家里用柴草造肥料，甚至连从不参加劳动的老太太，也都参加了造肥工作，掀起了一个轰轰烈烈的积肥造肥高潮。
    支部书记对我说：“绿肥太老了，会减低肥效。因此，今天（4月1日）开始翻耕绿肥田。”说着，就带我去参观翻耕绿肥田的情形。在一块十多亩大的绿肥田里，分成了三班人，一班是收割绿肥，将绿肥割下后，又用刀切碎，撒在田里，一班人赶着牛翻耕土地，一班人车水灌田。刚才还是一片绿色的海洋，现在就变成了散发着土香和草香的黑色的土地。翻耕过以后，就要在一两天内插上秧。支部书记说：这就叫“边耕边插”。根据去年的经验，采用这个方法，可以增加产量。
    干部在群众中
    雨还没有完全停止，在泥泞的田埂上，出现了二十多个工作人员。这些工作人员对两边的秧田，一块块地进行检查。对于发生了烂秧现象的秧田，检查得特别仔细。他们把烂秧拔起几棵来，仔细地观察发黄发红的叶子和腐烂的根部，接着，就询问管理方法。在这些工作人员中，有个胖胖的人，就是王县长。
    最近，有不少公社发生了烂秧现象。路桥公社胡守玉、蒋从听两个老农所管理的秧田，也发生了烂秧的现象。从这块田的管理方法来看，是不应该发生这种现象的。在种子播下去以后，这两人成天就在秧田里转，一发现秧田里有了一根柴草，或者有了一张树叶，或者有一块小石子，都要用竹杆拨弄出来。管理非常细致，真如绣花。
    但是，在秧苗长有一寸多高的时候，发生了烂秧现象。胡守玉和蒋从听同连长堂普定都十分着急。秧苗究竟发生了什么病？怎样发生的？怎么治法？不但当地有经验的农民回答不出来，就是在当地实习的农业大学的学生，也无法解答。
    正在这个时候，王县长来这里调查研究，并且找出了原因，提出了防治的方法。
    第二天，许多生产队又信心十足地重新播种、育秧。
    在黄岩，到处可以看到像王县长这样的领导干部。比如海门公社葭芷大队总支书记徐仁瑶，不仅深入生产，领导生产，而且他本人就是个插秧能手，曾经同“七仙女”之一、浙江青年插秧突击手王美云比赛过插秧。又如三甲公社赞扬生产队支部书记潘学年，不仅常常同社员一起劳动，而且非常关心社员的生活，社员有了病，就要去问水问茶。又如澄江公社先进队支部书记应梅儿，给自己规定了一个非常好的制度：白天参加生产，晚上进行工作。生产中有了问题，他很快就能发现。
    正是有了这样好的领导干部，保证了社员群众的干劲越来越高。
