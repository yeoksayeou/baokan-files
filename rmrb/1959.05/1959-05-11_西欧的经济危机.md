    Economic Crisis in Western Europe
    Su Lan
    While the "recovery" of the US economy is extremely shaky, the economic situation in Western European countries is further deteriorating. In April of this year, the British magazine "The Banker" admitted: "1958 was a period of economic recession in Western Europe."

    The deterioration of the Western European economy is developing at different speeds and in different forms in different countries. So far, it can be roughly divided into two types. Countries such as the United Kingdom, Belgium, Finland, and Norway have experienced a serious decline in industrial production. Industrial production in the United Kingdom began to decline in 1957, and although there was a slight rebound later, it once again fell below the monthly average index of 1953 in August last year. Due to the US economic crisis, Belgium's exports to the US decreased by 20% last year, which inevitably had a significant impact on its industrial production. Norway's industrial production once declined sharply last year, mainly in the paper, canning, electrical, and metallurgical industries. The other type of countries are West Germany, France, Italy, and Austria. Their industrial production has stagnated or the growth rate has slowed down significantly since the second quarter of 1958. For example, West Germany's industrial production only increased by 2%-3% last year, compared to 5%-6% in 1957 and 7%-8% in 1956. Italy's industrial production only grew by 1-2% last year, compared to 8% in both 1956 and 1957. For these countries, favorable factors are gradually disappearing, and unfavorable factors are constantly increasing. Although they have not yet entered a crisis, the internal conditions for a crisis are fully ripe.

    The following table shows the changes in the Western European economy in the past two years.

    However, whether it is the first type of country or the second type of country, from the perspective of the entire Western Europe, the universal facts are: (1) Some basic industrial sectors, such as steel, coal, construction, and textile industries, have been severely hit in the past year. Western Europe's steel production fell from 90.1 million tons in 1957 to 86.6 million tons. Among them, the United Kingdom's steel production fell from 21.7 million tons to 19.57 million tons, a drop of 10%. West Germany's crude steel production was only 22.8 million tons, a decrease of 7%, falling to the lowest level since 1955. The situation in the coal industry is even more serious. The total surplus coal in Western Europe increased from 16 million tons at the beginning of 1958 to 45 million tons at the end of the year. Among them, the United Kingdom had 20 million tons and West Germany had more than 8 million tons. Total coal production fell from 474 million tons in 1957 to 465 million tons in 1958. Only France did not experience a decline in coal and steel production, but its growth rate slowed down significantly. (2) Foreign trade has shrunk severely. Trade among member countries of the European Economic Cooperation Organization decreased by 4% from the first half of 1957 to the first half of 1958. In the past year, the United Kingdom's exports (calculated by quantity, the same below) decreased by 7.5%; the Netherlands 11.7%; Belgium 4.3%; Norway 6%; Sweden 5.4%.

    In recent months, Western European countries have taken various measures to get rid of the threat of crisis, such as reducing taxes for large companies, loosening credit, and devaluing currencies...etc. They attempt to create "active" domestic markets and expand exports through these methods. These artificial measures can only play a partial and temporary role. Since the beginning of this year, industrial production in some Western European countries has rebounded slightly. However, even if the Western European economy does not experience greater deterioration in the coming year, it will at least stagnate for a long time, or: rebound slightly and then continue to decline, showing a fluctuating state. For example, the British magazine "The Banker" admits that the Western European economy may have a "recovery," but "this recovery is gradual and wavering."

    With the factors of the US economic crisis still developing, the instability and deterioration of the Western European economy cannot but affect the United States in turn, at least, it may "disrupt" the "recovery" process of the US economy. The economic crisis of the capitalist world is developing under the mutual influence and promotion of the United States and Western Europe.

    The depth and breadth of this crisis in the capitalist world are different from the previous crises after the war. It affects not only the industrial countries of North America and Western Europe, but also the vast raw material producing countries in the capitalist world, the so-called "backward countries." The crises of 1948-1949 and 1953-1954 mainly occurred in the United States and individual countries that are particularly closely economically linked to the United States. Looking at various production sectors, this crisis affects almost all major industries; while in the 1951-1952 crisis, the textile industry was mainly affected. It is obviously an overly optimistic illusion to easily get rid of such a relatively deep crisis.

    After World War II, Western European countries carried out a large amount of capital renewal. With the establishment of many modern industries and the adoption of new technologies, demand has expanded and productivity has greatly increased. For example, in the United Kingdom, four workers now produce more cars than twenty workers produced thirty years ago. The output of the British chemical industry has doubled in the past ten years, and the average output per worker in this industrial sector has increased by 65%. Developed productive forces are facing increasingly smaller domestic and foreign markets. The economic crisis is breaking out on this basis.

    The impact of the capitalist economic crisis on Western European countries is very profound. It makes the various contradictions within capitalism increasingly acute, accelerating the process of this decadent social system "rotting down."

    The crisis has prompted Western European countries to intensify the struggle for markets. Every country wants to defeat its competitors and drown the other party. The contradictions in this regard are very complex. It is prominently manifested in the sharp struggle between the "Common Market" and the "Free Trade Area" plan (that is, between Britain and France, West Germany), and within the "Common Market."

    Since the failure of the negotiations on the "Free Trade Area" last December, the United Kingdom has not abandoned its desire to undermine the "Common Market." The United Kingdom's current attitude is to "wait and see," waiting for the development of internal contradictions within the "Common Market," and then take action. Saying waiting does not mean that the United Kingdom is standing idly by, doing nothing. In fact, the United Kingdom has only slightly changed its past noisy approach and adopted some other means. For example, some British monopoly groups are recently working to organize the seven countries outside the "Common Market" in order to confront the "Common Market." The "Financial Times" of April 15 reported: If such a new group can be established, it will greatly improve the United Kingdom's position in negotiations with the "Common Market."

    Within the "Common Market" and the "Coal and Steel Community," the interests of France and West Germany, large countries and small countries, have experienced sharp conflicts. Although the highest authorities of the "Coal and Steel Community" have repeatedly held meetings and made recommendations, they have yielded no results. On the steel issue, French steel, which is 10% cheaper than Ruhr steel prices, has squeezed into the West German market, causing disputes between French and West German monopoly groups. On the coal issue, the struggle is even more acute, with each country wanting to dump its surplus coal and restrict imports of coal from other countries. Recently, the trend of some large countries within the "Community" attempting to shift the coal crisis to Belgium alone has become increasingly apparent.

    The struggle for markets is also unfolding outside Western Europe. For example, in the export of manufactured goods in the capitalist world, the United Kingdom accounted for 19.7% in 1955, ranking second; West Germany accounted for 15.4%, ranking third. But by last year, West Germany accounted for 18.6%, while the United Kingdom accounted for 18%. West German capital is rapidly penetrating the British Commonwealth and France's colonies in Africa.

    It should also be mentioned that Western European countries are taking advantage of the US economic crisis and the weakening of its strength to resist the US control over Western Europe to varying degrees. For example, France's demand to share the leadership of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, and the United Kingdom's self-proclaimed "mediator" between imperialist groups to profit from it, are all happening against this economic background.

    At the same time, the capitalist economic crisis has further sharpened the contradictions between imperialism and "backward countries" (especially colonial countries). Most of the so-called "backward countries" are raw material producing countries. In the capitalist world trade, they have long been at a disadvantage. In the twenty years before 1955, the trade in industrial manufactured goods in the capitalist world increased by 60%. But the growth rate of raw material trade was only half that of industrial manufactured goods. In the past three years, world raw material prices have continued to fall, especially since 1957, due to US restrictions on raw material imports, causing raw material prices to plummet. According to the United Nations' survey of raw material prices in 1958, the average export price of raw materials fell by 10% from mid-1957 to mid-1958. At the same time, the prices of industrial manufactured goods imported into these countries rose by 1%. This has caused raw material producing countries to suffer great losses. Their losses are equivalent to one-sixth of the total gold and foreign exchange reserves of these countries. Capitalist industrial countries took the opportunity to make a fortune, thereby shifting the burden of the crisis to raw material producing countries. It is estimated that in the past year, the United Kingdom "earned" 450 million US dollars due to the drop in raw material prices, while West Germany "earned" 250 million US dollars.

    This cruel plunder by capitalist countries has led to the weakening of the purchasing power and the growth of resistance in raw material producing countries, causing a significant decline in exports to them from capitalist industrial countries. The value of the United Kingdom's exports to other countries in the Sterling area was 1.499 billion pounds in 1957, but decreased to 1.455 billion pounds in 1958.

    In order to shift the crisis, monopoly capital groups in various countries are intensifying their attacks on people's lives, which makes domestic contradictions in various countries more acute. In this crisis, the profits of monopoly groups in various countries have increased unprecedentedly, while the vast middle and lower classes have been severely hit.

    With the shrinking and stagnation of production, a huge army of unemployed has emerged in the capitalist world. The number of unemployed in the United Kingdom reached 550,000, accounting for 2.5% of the labor force. The number of unemployed in West Germany accounted for 5.6%; Italy 8.9%; Denmark 8.3%; Belgium 7.2%. France, which has fewer unemployed people, has also reached 200,000. Of course, the actual number of unemployed is far more than these figures officially announced. For example, in the United Kingdom, it is estimated that the actual number of unemployed has exceeded the million mark. If we add the large number of semi-unemployed groups in various countries, the problem is even more serious. In addition, workers' real wages have not increased, but prices have continued to rise, resulting in lower and lower purchasing power for the people. In France, prices rose by 6% after the devaluation of the franc in December last year. In the United Kingdom, the retail price index rose by six points in 1957 and 1958. In contrast, the profits of monopoly groups have increased greatly. In the United Kingdom, the profits of only 2,758 manufacturers in 1958 increased by 1.3 billion pounds compared to 1957.

    This result of adding the burden of the crisis to the shoulders of the working people cannot but arouse the resistance of the people of various countries, especially the working class. At the same time, the shrinking of the domestic market cannot but deepen the development of the crisis.

    In order to get rid of the economic crisis, some major capitalist countries in Western Europe are further expanding the military industry, increasing military expenditures, and deepening economic militarization.

    In the 1958-1959 fiscal year, the United Kingdom's "defense expenditure" was 1.418 billion pounds, while in the 1959-1960 fiscal year it increased to 1.502 billion pounds. The proportion of the military industry in the West German economy was not very large originally. However, with the shrinking of domestic and foreign markets, it now also wants to expand arms production to "escape" the crisis. Bonn's Minister of Defense Strauss recently stated that for West Germany, military production is "absolutely necessary," which can enable West Germany to occupy a "certain position" in national defense armaments.

    In terms of expanding arms production, they spend a lot of money on nuclear weapons. The United Kingdom is preparing to spend 500 million pounds to manufacture so-called "Blue Streak" missiles. France has also invested a lot of money in nuclear weapons production and is determined to become the "fourth nuclear power." However, facts have long proven that the development of economic militarization only pushes the economic crisis to a more serious stage. Therefore, in Western Europe, there is a growing desire to ease tensions and develop relations with socialist countries. (Attached chart)

    西欧的经济危机
    苏兰
    当美国经济的“复苏”极不牢靠的时候，西欧国家的经济情况却在进一步恶化。今年4月英国的“银行家”杂志承认：“1958年是西欧经济的衰退时期”。
    西欧经济的恶化，在各个不同的国家，正以不同的速度、不同的形式发展着。到目前为止，大体上可以分为两种类型。英国、比利时、芬兰和挪威等国，工业生产曾有严重下降。英国的工业生产从1957年起，即开始下降，以后虽稍有回升，但到去年8月时，又一度跌落到1953年的每月平均指数以下。由于美国的经济危机，比利时去年对美输出减少了20％，这不能不对它的工业生产发生重大影响。挪威去年工业生产曾一度急剧下降，这主要发生在造纸、罐头和电气、冶金工业部门。另一类国家是西德、法国、意大利和奥地利等国。它们的工业生产从1958年第二季度起即陷于停顿，或者是增长的速度已大大缓慢下来。比如西德，去年工业生产只增加了2％—3％，而1957年却是5％—6％，1956年为7％—8％。意大利的工业生产，去年只增长了1—2％，而1956和1957年都是8％。对于这些国家来说，有利的因素正在逐渐消失，不利的因素正在不断增长。它们虽然还没有进入危机，但危机的内在条件已完全成熟。
    从下列的表格中，可以看出西欧经济在最近两年中的变化。
    但是，不论是第一类国家也好，第二类国家也好，从整个西欧来看，带有普遍性的事实是：（一）一些基本工业部门，比如钢、煤、建筑以及纺织工业等，在过去一年中受到了严重打击。西欧的钢产量从1957年的九千零十万吨跌到八千六百六十万吨。其中英国的钢产量从二千一百七十万吨下降到一千九百五十七万吨，跌了10％。西德的原钢生产只有二千二百八十万吨，减产7％，跌到1955年来的最低水平。煤炭工业的情况更为严重。整个西欧过剩的煤，从1958年初的一千六百万吨增加到年底的四千五百万吨。其中英国为二千万吨，西德为八百多万吨。煤的总产量则从1957年的四亿七千四百万吨下降到1958年的四亿六千五百万吨。煤、钢生产没有下跌的只有法国，但其增长速度却大大缓慢了。（二）对外贸易严重萎缩。在欧洲经济合作局成员国间的贸易，从1957年上半年到1958年上半年，下降了4％。在去年一年中，英国的出口（按数量计，下同）下降了7.5％；荷兰11.7％；比利时4.3％；挪威6％；瑞典5.4％。
    近几个月来，西欧各国为了摆脱危机的威胁，采取种种措施，比如减少大公司的纳税、放松信贷、货币贬值……等。他们企图通过这些办法，造成国内市场的“活跃”，并扩大出口。这种人为的措施，当然只能起局部的、暂时的作用。今年年初以来，西欧一部分国家的工业生产曾稍有回升。但是西欧经济在未来一年中即使不发生更大的恶化，至少也将长期停滞，或者是：稍有回升又继续下跌，呈反复动摇状态。如英国的“银行家”杂志就承认，西欧的经济可能有“恢复”，但“这种恢复是逐步的和摇摆的”。
    在美国经济危机因素仍在发展的情况下，西欧经济的动摇不定和恶化，不能不反转来影响到美国，至少，它可能“搅乱”美国经济的“复苏”进程。资本主义世界的经济危机，是在美国和西欧相互影响、相互推动的情况下发展着的。
    资本主义世界这次危机的深度和广度，同战后历次危机的情况不相同。它既影响到北美和西欧的工业国家，也影响到资本主义世界中广大的原料生产国家，即所谓“落后国家”。而1948—1949年和1953—1954年的危机，主要发生在美国以及在经济上同美国特别密切的个别国家。再从各个生产部门来看，这次危机几乎影响到所有的主要工业；而在1951—1952年危机时，受到打击的主要是纺织工业。要想轻易地摆脱这样一次比较深刻的危机，显然是一种过于乐观的幻想。
    第二次世界大战后，西欧国家曾进行了大量的资本更新。随着许多现代化工业的建立和新技术的采用，需求随之扩大，生产率也大大提高。例如在英国，目前四个工人所生产的汽车，比三十年前二十个工人生产的还要多。英国化学工业的产量，在最近十年内增加了一倍，而这一工业部门内每个工人的平均产量则增加了65％。发展了的生产力，面临着愈来愈小的国内外市场。经济危机正是在这一基础上爆发出来的。
    资本主义经济危机对西欧国家的影响是十分深刻的。它使资本主义内部的各种矛盾日益尖锐，加速了这一腐朽的社会制度“烂下去”的过程。
    危机促使西欧国家间加紧了争夺市场的斗争。每一个国家都想把竞争者打倒，把对方淹死。这方面的矛盾是十分复杂的。它突出地表现为“共同市场”和“自由贸易区”计划之间（也就是英国同法国、西德之间），以及“共同市场”内部的尖锐斗争。
    自从去年12月关于“自由贸易区”的谈判失败以后，英国并没有放弃搞垮“共同市场”的愿望。英国目前的态度是“坐以待变”，等待“共同市场”内部矛盾的发展，再乘机下手。说是等待，并不意味着英国袖手旁观，什么也不干。事实上，英国只是稍稍改变一下过去大吵大嚷的作法，改而采用一些别的手段。比如，英国某些垄断集团最近正在活动把“共同市场”以外的七国组织起来，以便同“共同市场”相对抗。4月15日的“金融时报”报道：如果这样一个新的集团能够建立，将使英国在对“共同市场”的谈判中的地位大大改善。
    在“共同市场”和“煤钢联营”内部，法国同西德、大国同小国之间的利益，发生了尖锐的冲突。“煤钢联营”最高当局虽然屡次开会，提出建议，但却毫无结果。在钢的问题上，比鲁尔钢价便宜10％的法国钢，挤入了西德市场，引起了法国同西德垄断集团间的争吵。在煤的问题上，斗争更加尖锐，每个国家都想把自己剩余的煤抛售出去，而限制别国的煤的进口。最近，“联营”内部的一些大国企图把煤的危机转嫁到比利时一国身上的趋势越来越明显了。
    争夺市场的斗争，也在西欧外部展开。例如，在资本主义世界的制造品出口中，1955年英国占19.7％，居第二位；西德占15.4％，居第三位。但到了去年，西德已占18.6％，英国则占18％。西德资本正在急剧地渗入英联邦和法国在非洲的殖民地。
    还应该提到，西欧国家正利用美国发生经济危机、实力受到削弱的机会，对美国控制西欧的作法进行不同程度的反抗。比如，法国要求分享北大西洋公约组织的领导权，英国则以帝国主义集团间的“调停人”自居，从中渔利，这都是在这一经济背景下发生的。
    同时，资本主义经济危机使得帝国主义和“落后国家”（特别是殖民地国家）之间的矛盾进一步尖锐化。所谓“落后国家”，多半是原料生产国。在资本主义世界贸易中，他们长期以来处于不利地位。在1955年以前的二十年中，资本主义世界工业制造品的贸易增长了60％。但原料贸易的增长率却只及工业制造品的一半。近三年来，世界原料价格不断下跌，特别从1957年起，由于美国限制原料进口，造成原料价格猛跌。根据联合国对1958年原料价格的调查，从1957年年中到1958年年中，原料的平均出口价格下降了10％。与此同时，输入到这些国家的工业制造品价格却上涨了1％。这就使原料生产国家吃了大亏。他们所受的损失，相当于这些国家黄金、外汇储备总和的六分之一。资本主义工业国乘机发了横财，从而把危机的负担转嫁到原料生产国家身上。据估计，在去年一年内，英国因原料价格下跌“赚”的钱达四亿五千万美元，西德则“赚”了二亿五千万美元。
    资本主义国家这种残酷的掠夺，引起了原料生产国家购买力的削弱和反抗的增长，使资本主义工业国对它们的出口大大下降。英国对英镑区其它国家的输出品价值，1957年为十四亿九千九百万英镑，1958年则减为十四亿五千五百万英镑。
    各国垄断资本集团为了转嫁危机，加紧向人民生活进攻，这就使各国国内的矛盾更加尖锐。在这次危机中，各国垄断集团的利润空前增加了，而广大中下阶层受到了严重的打击。
    随着生产的萎缩和停滞，在资本主义世界中出现了一支庞大的失业军。英国的失业人数达五十五万人，占劳动人口的2.5％。西德失业人数占到5.6％；意大利占8.9％；丹麦占8.3％；比利时占7.2％。失业人数较少的法国，也达到了二十万人。当然，实际的失业人数，远比官方公布的这些数字多得多。比如在英国，估计实际失业人数已破百万大关。如果再加上各国的大量半失业群，问题就更加严重。此外，工人的实际工资没有增加，而物价却不断上涨，致使人民购买力越来越低。法国在去年12月法郎贬值后，物价上涨了6％。英国在1957、1958两年中，零售价格指数上涨了六点。与此相反，垄断资本集团的利润却大大增加了。在英国，仅二千七百五十八家厂商1958年的利润，就比1957年增加了十三亿镑。
    这种把危机重担加于劳动人民肩上的结果，不能不引起各国人民，特别是工人群众的反抗。同时，国内市场的萎缩也不能不加深危机的发展。
    西欧一些主要资本主义国家，为了摆脱经济危机，正在进一步扩大军事工业，增加军费开支，加深经济军事化。
    英国在1958—1959财政年度中，“国防支出”为十四亿一千八百万英镑，而1959—1960年度则增加到十五亿零二百万镑。西德经济中军事工业的比重原来并不太大。但是，随着国内外市场的萎缩，它现在也要扩大军火生产，以“逃避”危机。波恩国防部长斯特劳斯最近声称：对于西德来说，军事生产是“绝对必要的”，这可以使西德在国防军备中占有“一定的地位”。
    在扩大军火生产方面，它们把很大一笔钱花在核武器上。英国准备花五亿英镑，来制造所谓“蓝光”式导弹。法国也在核武器生产上下了不少本钱，决心想成为“第四核子大国”。但是，事实早已证明，经济军事化的发展只有使经济危机推向更严重的地步。因此，在西欧，要求缓和紧张局势、发展同社会主义国家的愿望有了增长。（附图表）
