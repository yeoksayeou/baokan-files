　　Talking about "Eating Chili Peppers"
　　Fu Lianzhang
    Chili peppers are a food enjoyed by many people. Therefore, whether eating chili peppers is beneficial or harmful is a concern for many.

    To answer this question, one must first understand the main components and effects of chili peppers.

    Chili peppers contain a component called capsaicin, which is the source of the spiciness. There are many types of chili peppers. Generally, those that are large, fleshy, and rich in water, such as the bell peppers we are all familiar with, have a low proportion of capsaicin and are not very spicy. Conversely, those that are small, thin-fleshed, and have low water content have a relatively high proportion of capsaicin and are very spicy, such as the cayenne pepper. The placenta (the core of the chili) and seeds of ripe chili peppers are rich in capsaicin. Washing them away before eating can reduce the spiciness.

    Capsaicin is a stomachic. Moderate consumption can increase the secretion of digestive juices and gastrointestinal motility, which helps with digestive function. It also has the effect of promoting circulation. After eating it, people often experience facial flushing and sweating, giving a feeling of warmth. According to traditional Chinese medicine, it has the properties of "dispelling wind, promoting blood circulation, dispersing cold, relieving stagnation, and guiding stagnation." For wind-cold colds, it can be as effective as ginger soup. Chili peppers can be made into an ointment to treat frostbite that has not yet ulcerated.

    More than twenty years ago, in the Central Revolutionary Base Areas, due to the Kuomintang reactionaries' inhumane blockade, it was difficult to replenish medicines. Chili peppers were often used to treat illnesses for revolutionary soldiers and the people in the liberated areas. At that time, table salt was also temporarily lacking due to the blockade, and chili peppers were used as a good substitute seasoning. During the Long March across snow-capped mountains and grasslands, the weather was freezing cold. Soldiers used the method of eating a little chili pepper to keep warm. I remember that some people who had opposed eating chili peppers exceptionally resorted to chili peppers on the way across the snow-capped mountains and grasslands. It can be seen that chili peppers played a great role in those years. Many of us have a history of "shared hardship" with chili peppers.

    Today, we no longer need to use chili peppers to replace salt, and our medical conditions are getting better and better. The role of chili peppers in treatment is no longer important. However, for us to live healthier and happier lives, it is still necessary to examine our habit of eating chili peppers from a hygienic point of view.

    The nutritional value of chili peppers should be affirmed. Fresh chili peppers are rich in vitamins A and C, especially vitamin C, which ranks first among vegetables. However, people cannot expect chili peppers to be the main source of vitamin C, because vitamin C is widely distributed in vegetables and fruits. For example, the vitamin C content of amaranth is only one-third of that of chili peppers, but it is not difficult for people to eat half a kilogram of amaranth, while it is not so easy to finish 200 grams of chili peppers. The absolute amount of vitamin C contained in half a kilogram of amaranth is more than that in 200 grams of chili peppers, so people who do not have the habit of eating chili peppers do not need to sigh with regret.

    Dried and pickled chili peppers lose a lot of vitamins and can only be used for flavoring, with little nutritional value. The spicy taste entering the mouth greatly increases saliva, making the chyme smooth and easy to swallow, which can indeed enhance appetite. However, if you rely too much on chili peppers to accompany your meals, you will reduce your intake of other nutrients. Moreover, the excessive saliva secretion caused by chili peppers is not entirely a phenomenon necessary for digestion, but mainly a physiological protective reflex, because secreting excessive saliva is to dilute the spiciness and reduce local stimulation. If you eat too many chili peppers, there will be similar hypersecretion and excessive congestion in the stomach as in the oral cavity, with increased peristalsis, which can cause abdominal pain. This is the transformation from a physiological phenomenon to a pathological stage, which is medically called "acute catarrhal gastritis." As for the amount of chili peppers, how much is appropriate and how much can cause disease varies depending on each person's habits and tolerance.

    People with diseases, except for the aforementioned diseases that chili peppers are effective in treating, generally should not eat chili peppers; especially various inflammations, certain vascular and gastrointestinal diseases, such as many febrile diseases, tuberculosis, dermatitis, ulcers, chronic gastroenteritis, hemorrhoids, and high blood pressure, because chili peppers can enhance vascular excitement and stimulate the gastrointestinal tract, which has adverse effects on these diseases.

    Chili peppers have both stomachic effects and certain nutritional value. Therefore, for people who have the habit of eating chili peppers, eating less is beneficial and eating more is harmful. For people who do not have the habit, there is no need to advocate it, and patients with certain diseases should abstain from it.

### 谈谈“吃辣椒”

　　谈谈“吃辣椒”
　　傅连暲
    辣椒是很多人喜爱的一种食物，因此，吃辣椒有益或者有害也是很多人关心的问题。
    要回答这个问题，首先必须了解辣椒的主要成分和作用。
    辣椒中含有一种成分叫做辣椒素，它就是辣味的来源。辣椒的种类很多，大凡形大、肉厚、富于水份的如大家熟知的柿子椒等，辣椒素的含量比例少，辣味不浓。反之形小、肉薄、水份含量少的，辣椒素相对的比例就大，辣味也强，例如羊角椒。成熟后的辣椒胎座（即俗称的辣椒心子）和种子，富含辣椒素，如在食用前洗去，可使辣味减轻。
    辣椒素是一种健胃剂，适量食用能增加消化液的分泌和胃肠蠕动，有助于消化功能。它又具有增进循环的作用，食后每有面部发赤出汗的现象，使人有一种温暖的感觉。按中医的说法它有“袪风、行血、散寒、解郁、导滞”的性质，对于风寒感冒，用之可以与姜汤同样奏效。将辣椒作成油膏，能治未溃烂的冻疮。
    二十多年以前，在中央革命根据地，一度由于国民党反动派灭绝人性的封锁，药物补充困难，辣椒曾常常被用来为革命战士和解放区的人民治病。那时食盐也曾因封锁而一时缺少，辣椒又被用来代替食盐成为很好的调味品。长征过雪山草地时，天寒地冻，奇冷异常，战士们更采用了吃一点辣椒来御寒的办法。我记得曾经反对过吃辣椒的人，在雪山草地途中，也破例的借助了辣椒。可见，辣椒在当年的作用可谓大矣。而我们很多人与辣椒也就有着一种“患难之交”的历史渊源。
    今天，我们已无须用辣椒来代替食盐，我们的医药条件也越来越好，辣椒在治疗上的作用也不重要了。然而为了我们生活得更健康和幸福，还有必要用卫生的观点，来检验一下我们吃辣椒的习惯。
    辣椒的营养价值应该肯定，新鲜的辣椒富有甲种和丙种维生素，特别是丙种维生素，居菜蔬中之首位。但是人们可以不指望辣椒作为取得丙种维生素的主要来源，因为丙种维生素广泛分布于蔬菜和水果之中。例如苋菜的丙种维生素含量，虽然仅及辣椒的三分之一，但是人们不难吃下一斤苋菜，而吃完四两辣椒却不那么容易。一斤苋菜所含的丙种维生素的绝对量比四两辣椒就要多，所以没有吃辣椒习惯的人，也就不必向隅兴叹了。
    干腌辣椒维生素损失颇多，只能用来调味，而没有甚么营养价值。辣味入口，唾液大增，使食糜润滑，易于下咽，固然有增进食欲之功，但如果过份的依赖了辣椒来佐餐，就将减少对于其他营养物的摄取；况且辣椒引起的过量唾液分泌，并不完全是消化所必需的现象，而主要是一种生理的保护性反射，因为分泌过量唾液，是为了稀释辣味和减轻对局部的刺激。如果辣椒吃得太多，在胃内将有与口腔类似的分泌亢进以及过度充血，蠕动增剧而引起腹痛的感觉，这就是从生理现象转化到了病理的阶段，医学上称之为“急性加答儿性胃炎”。至于吃辣椒的量，多少为适宜，多少可以致病，则是因每个人的习惯和耐受量的不同而有所区别。
    患有疾病的人，除前述几种辣椒治之有效的疾病而外，一般均不宜吃辣椒；尤其是各种炎症、某些血管系和胃肠疾病，如许多热性病、肺结核、皮肤炎、溃疡病、慢性胃肠炎、痔疮和高血压等，因为辣椒能增强血管的兴奋和对肠胃的刺激，对于这些疾病有不利的影响。
    辣椒既有健胃作用，又有一定的营养价值，所以，对于有吃辣椒习惯的人，是少吃有益，多吃有害；没有习惯的人，也无须提倡，而某些疾病患者则应禁食。
