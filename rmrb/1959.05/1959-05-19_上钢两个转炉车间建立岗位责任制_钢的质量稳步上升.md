Shanghai, May 18th (reported by this newspaper) - The No. 3 and No. 6 Steel Plants in Shanghai have, on the basis of mobilizing the masses to sum up production experience, comprehensively revised technical operating procedures and established a post responsibility system in their two converter workshops. The quality and output of converter steel have steadily increased, and iron consumption and costs have gradually decreased.

The No. 1 Converter Workshop of the Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant and the Converter Workshop of the No. 6 Steel Plant are both old steelmaking workshops and originally had a relatively complete set of operating procedures and management systems. Since the Great Leap Forward, because the types and quality of raw materials such as pig iron and coke have changed greatly and are not easy to master, and because many new workers have been added, many of the original operating procedures and management systems have either become unsuited to the current production situation, or need to be further implemented. Since the beginning of this year, in carrying out the high-yield and high-quality competition, these two workshops have noted that in order to continuously improve the quality and output of steel, it is first necessary to establish normal production order and have a set of rules and regulations suitable for the current production conditions. As early as the first quarter, the two workshops gradually established some necessary new regulations and systems in response to the weakest links in production at that time. Then, in April, they launched a mass movement to establish rules and regulations. On the one hand, they rectified and revised the past system, re-affirming some of the regulations that are still useful; on the other hand, they mobilized the masses to sum up experience from the bottom up, and formulated and supplemented new regulations. In the No. 1 Converter Workshop of Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant, workers posted more than 1,000 big-character posters during the great blooming and contending, and put forward many suggestions for improvement from the aspects of operating techniques, post responsibilities, and cooperative relationships. Shanghai No. 6 Steel Plant also held symposiums for three shifts of workers, and formulated operating points and inspection systems for important work sections such as pig iron furnaces and converter linings based on everyone's operating experience.

The operating procedures revised by the two workshops based on the experience of the masses are in line with the current production reality. When the No. 3 Steel Plant's converter workshop used local iron to make steel, the sulfur content varied, and the workers' operating methods were also different. Daring furnace chiefs sometimes released steel after making slag twice when the sulfur content was high, which often affected the quality of the steel; some furnace chiefs, sometimes clearly knew that the sulfur content had met the standards and could release steel, but, for the sake of caution, they made slag one more time, resulting in a longer blowing time and a greatly increased iron consumption. Therefore, everyone eagerly hoped to have a new set of operating procedures. This time, they absorbed the operating advantages of each furnace chief and stipulated different slag-making times according to different molten iron compositions. According to the new regulations, the quality of steel has been generally improved, and the smelting time has been further shortened.

After the No. 3 Steel Plant's converter workshop established the post responsibility system, the level of management in the workshop has been rapidly improved. In the workshop, not only the workshop director, duty director, chief engineer, and section chiefs at all levels have clear divisions of labor, but also every worker is clearly responsible, has a post, and production accidents have been greatly reduced.

With the revision and improvement of rules and regulations, the quality and output of steel in these two workshops have been relatively stable. In April, the utilization coefficient of the four movable converters in the No. 1 Converter Workshop of Shanghai No. 3 Steel Plant increased from 19.874 in March to 22.2, and in early May, it further increased to 27.33. The qualified rate of steel ingots in April increased from 96.14% in January to 99.2%. The utilization coefficient of the six fixed converters in Shanghai No. 6 Steel Plant also increased from 11.68 in January to 15.51 in April, and the qualified rate of steel has remained above 98% for the past three months. At present, the amount of iron used to make one ton of steel has been reduced by more than 60 kilograms compared with January, and the cost of steel in April has been reduced by 7% compared with the first quarter. Among the nation's converters, these two workshops in Shanghai have both raised the red banner of high quality and high yield. (Zhou Yongkang) (Attached picture)

    上钢两个转炉车间建立岗位责任制
    钢的质量稳步上升
    本报上海18日电　上钢三厂和上钢六厂的两个转炉车间在发动群众总结生产经验的基础上，全面修订技术操作规程和建立岗位责任制，转炉钢的质量和产量稳步上升，铁耗和成本逐步下降。
    上钢三厂第一转炉车间和六厂的转炉车间都是老炼钢车间，原来都有一套比较完整的操作规程和管理制度。大跃进以来，因为用的生铁、焦炭等原料的品种和质量变动很大，不易掌握，加上增添了许多新工人，因此，原有的许多操作规程和管理制度，有的已经不能适应当前的生产情况，有的需要进一步加以贯彻执行。今年以来，这两个车间在开展高产优质竞赛中，就注意到要不断提高钢的质量产量，首先就需要建立正常的生产秩序，需要有一套适合当前生产条件的规章制度。早在第一季度，两个车间针对当时生产中最薄弱的环节，逐步建立了一些必要的新规程、新制度。接着，4月份，又展开了一个大立规章制度的群众运动。他们一方面把过去的制度加以整顿修改，把部分目前仍然有用的规章重新加以肯定；另一方面，发动群众自下而上总结经验，制订和补充新的规程。上钢三厂第一转炉车间工人们在大鸣大放中，贴出了一千多张大字报，从操作技术、岗位职责、协作关系等几个方面提出了许多改进的意见。上钢六厂也召开了三班工人座谈会，根据大家的操作经验，制订了化铁炉、转炉炉衬等重要工段的操作要点和检查制度。
    两个车间以群众的经验为依据修订的操作规程，是符合当前生产实际的。三厂转炉车间在用土铁炼钢时，硫的成分高低不一，工人的操作方法也各有不同。胆子大的炉长，有时在含硫较高的情况下，造两次渣就放钢，钢的质量往往受到影响；有的炉长，有时明明知道硫的成分已经合格，可以放钢了，但是，为了谨慎起见，又多造一次渣，结果吹炼时间拖长了，铁耗也大大增加。因此，大家迫切希望能有一套新的操作规程。这次，他们吸收各个炉长的操作优点，根据不同的铁水成分，规定了不同的造渣次数。根据新的规程操作，钢的质量普遍提高，冶炼时间也进一步缩短了。
    上钢三厂转炉车间在建立岗位责任制以后，车间里的管理工作水平是迅速提高了。在车间里，不仅车间主任、值班主任、总工长、工段长各级干部都有了明确分工，即是每一个工人也都分清职责，各有岗位，生产上的事故大大减少。
  随着规章制度的修订和健全，这两个车间钢的质量和产量都比较稳定。4月份，上钢三厂第一转炉车间四座活动式转炉的利用系数从3月份的十九点八七四提高到二十二点二，5月上旬又提高到二十七点三三。4月份的钢锭合格率从1月份的96.14％提高到99.2％。上钢六厂六座固定式转炉的利用系数，4月份也从1月份的十一点六八提高到十五点五一，钢的合格率最近三个多月一直保持在98％以上。目前，炼一吨钢用的铁比1月份降低了六十多公斤，钢的成本4月份比第一季度降低了7％。在全国转炉中，上钢这两个车间双双举起了优质高产红旗。　（周永康）（附图片）
