Harbin Wire Factory
"Special Project" Production Proceeds Methodically
(Our newspaper, Harbin, 7th dispatch) How to improve the logistics of key equipment production? Recently, Harbin Wire Factory has adopted a method of organizing "paired" production of special projects with mechanical and electrical machinery factories, which has resolved the contradiction between supply and demand.

When mechanical and electrical factories are rushing to manufacture the six major equipments, they often encounter a difficult problem: some of the steel, wire, and other materials allocated by steel and wire factories are incomplete in specifications. For example, they need thin steel plates but are allocated thick steel plates, they need fine enameled wire but are supplied with thick ones. As a result, the production factories have to send people to the raw material factories to make adjustments. The material factories also have their own difficulties. The material specifications can be as many as thousands. How can they guarantee supply according to specifications, quantity, and time?

The Harbin Wire Factory solved this problem by organizing paired production. Their specific approach is as follows: At the end of March, the factory convened a counterpart meeting, where key factories that need wire materials put forward the varieties, specifications, quantities, and delivery dates of the wire materials they needed. Then, the wire factory worked out a mutually paired special wire production plan based on the order plans submitted by these factories, and then carried out production according to the plan.

### 哈尔滨电线厂  “专案”生产有条不紊

　　哈尔滨电线厂
    “专案”生产有条不紊
    本报哈尔滨7日电　如何做好重点设备的后勤工作，最近哈尔滨电线厂采用了一种和机械电机工厂组织专案“对口”生产的办法，解决了供求之间的矛盾。
    各机械电机工厂在突击制造六大设备的时候，常常会碰到一个难题：各钢铁、电线等材料工厂拨来的材料，其中有些规格不全，有的需要薄钢板却拨来了厚钢板，需要细漆包线却运来了粗的。这样，就要生产工厂派人到原材料工厂去进行调剂。材料工厂方面也有苦衷，材料规格多达千百种，怎样按规格、按数量按时间来保证供应呢？
    哈尔滨电线厂在组织对口生产中，解决了这个问题。它的具体做法是这样的。工厂在3月下旬召开了一个对口会议，由需要电线材料的重点工厂提出需用电线材料的品种、规格、数量和交货日期，然后，电线厂就根据这些工厂提出的定货计划，排出互相对口的专案电线生产计划来，再按计划进行生产。
