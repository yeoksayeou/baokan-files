Chairman, fellow deputies:

We fully agree with Premier Zhou Enlai's government work report and the reports of other leaders. After listening to these reports, we are very excited. Our country used to be "poor and blank," but now, in just a few short years, it has achieved such brilliant achievements in economic and cultural aspects. How can we not be overjoyed!

The more victorious our cause, the more the enemy will try to sabotage us. Recently, reactionary elements of the upper strata of the former Tibetan local government, under the instigation and incitement of British imperialists and foreign reactionaries, betrayed the motherland, undermined national unity, and launched an armed rebellion. For the sake of the unity of the motherland and the happiness of the Tibetan people, we firmly support the government's measures to quell the rebellion and cheer for the rapid suppression of the rebellion. Tibet has been Chinese territory since ancient times, and handling the Tibetan rebellion is our country's internal affair, and no foreign interference is allowed. These days, Indian interventionists, disregarding Sino-Indian friendship, want to use the Tibetan rebellion to split Tibet from China. We warn them that your conspiracy will never be realized. If you continue to act arbitrarily, you will only be bruised and battered in front of the 600 million Chinese people and the people of the world, and you will gain nothing else.

We are health workers and Red Cross workers. Now, we would like to express some opinions on how to improve health work to promote the development of industry and agriculture.

In 1958, with the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production, health work centered on the Patriotic Health Campaign also made great progress and played a significant role in supporting industrial and agricultural production. Many local summaries have such statements: production drives health work, and health work promotes production. In 1959, the tasks of industrial and agricultural production are even more arduous than in 1958. In order to ensure the completion of the tasks of industrial and agricultural production, it is necessary to do a better job in health work, continue to carry out the health campaign to eliminate pests and diseases, strengthen the health measures for collective life in people's communes and factory and mine construction sites, and vigorously prevent the occurrence and spread of seasonal infectious diseases.

According to the experience of previous years, especially in 1958, to do these tasks well, in addition to firmly relying on the leadership of the Party and conscientiously implementing the mass line, we must grasp two key points: first, the integration of health work with production, and second, the integration of science and technology with the mass movement.

What is the integration of health work with production? It means that health serves production, production emphasizes hygiene, and health activities are arranged according to the characteristics of production, so that health work closely revolves around production. Because doing a good job in production is the primary task of the people of the whole country, and it is the fundamental measure to consolidate people's communes and continuously improve people's lives, all work must be subordinate to the needs of production and combined with production as the center, and must not hinder production. Therefore, health work must start from production and serve production, and cannot unilaterally emphasize the importance of health and require putting down production to engage in health exclusively. Otherwise, it would be putting the cart before the horse. However, to do a good job in production, it is necessary to protect the health of the workers, and good labor is inseparable from a healthy body. Therefore, hygiene must also be emphasized in production, and health work must be regarded as one of the measures to do a good job in production. Therefore, health work and production must be carried out in combination. It is certainly wrong to emphasize hygiene unilaterally without starting from production; if one only buries oneself in production and does not pay attention to health work, the result will also affect production. In past years, there have been many examples of increasing production by doing a good job in hygiene, both in industry and agriculture. The Second Engineering Company of Wuhan Iron and Steel Company has become a model health unit due to its vigorous health campaign, which basically achieved "four nos" and "five cleans." The incidence of disease among employees in 1958 decreased by 57 percent compared with 1957, and the attendance rate increased by 4 percent. As a result, the annual production plan was completed ahead of schedule, becoming an advanced production unit. Xiatian Village, Sheng County, Zhejiang Province, has done a good job in health. Since 1953, no one in the village has suffered from infectious diseases. When production leaped forward last year, very few people suffered from colds and coughs, and the attendance rate reached more than 95 percent. In addition, with more fertilizer accumulation and other measures, the average yield of rice per mu in the village was more than 1,000 catties, becoming a model village for all-round leap forward. On the contrary, there are also many lessons learned from the impact of production due to poor hygiene. For example, a county in Hebei originally had good production results, but last year in September and October, insufficient attention was paid to the hygiene of collective living places on construction sites, breeding places for mosquitoes and flies were not seriously eliminated, the treatment of feces and garbage was not good, drinking water was not disinfected, and no attention was paid to food hygiene. In addition, the discovery of diseases was not reported and dealt with in a timely manner. As a result, many diseases became popular. According to the investigation of five villages, the total number of cases of encephalitis, dysentery, whooping cough, influenza, typhoid fever, paratyphoid fever and other diseases reached 13 to 20 percent of the local population, greatly reducing attendance and labor efficiency, and affecting production; later, thanks to the Party Committee's proper attention to health work, the situation improved. These examples fully show that doing a good job in the health campaign to eliminate pests and diseases is indeed an important factor in improving production. As some people say: "Health is the capital of production, and being disease-free is the guarantee of the leap forward."

Production must emphasize hygiene

From the current situation, the problem of health work serving production has generally been solved. However, some people have not fully solved the problem of emphasizing hygiene in production in their ideological understanding. These people are afraid that launching mass health campaigns will delay production, and they have not combined health work with production. They put down health work when production is slightly tight. This is the main reason why the health campaign in some areas is not good enough. We believe that this is a problem that needs to be studied and solved urgently. Carrying out health campaigns, especially large-scale blitzes, does take up some labor and time. However, this issue should be viewed dialectically, seeing both the contradictory side and the unified side; seeing both the present and the long-term. From the present point of view, carrying out the movement to eliminate pests and diseases requires taking out a portion of manpower, which is contradictory to production; but the result is to increase more labor and improve labor attendance and labor efficiency. Ningdu County, Jiangxi Province, carried out a large-scale pest and disease elimination campaign from December 1958 to January this year, consuming a total of 100,000 workdays, which had a certain impact on production at that time; however, because this campaign basically eliminated five diseases such as venereal diseases, ringworm, filariasis, hookworm disease, and malaria, and cured a large number of patients, putting them into production, the translated result is that it can increase more than one million workdays a year. Moreover, this is not only a benefit for a year and a half, but a major event that benefits future generations. The problem lies in the overall planning of the leadership. If the leadership makes overall arrangements well and closely combines health work with production, even mobilizing more people to engage in health campaigns will not delay production, but will promote production. The reason why the Second Engineering Company of Wuhan Iron and Steel Company has become an advanced unit in both production and health is because it has closely combined health work with production arrangements. Their methods are: combining construction site hygiene with safe production; combining environmental sanitation with the development of sideline production (fish farming) and greening; combining workshop hygiene with the maintenance of production equipment; and combining food hygiene with the improvement of food. There are more ways to carry out health campaigns in agriculture. For example, combining fertilizer accumulation with cleaning and sweeping and eliminating mosquito and fly breeding places, combining water conservancy construction with snail elimination, and so on. Especially combining fertilizer accumulation with health campaigns is a very effective method. This spring, many areas seized the high tide of fertilizer accumulation and carried out activities such as "hygienic villages" and "hygienic families," which not only did a good job in hygiene, but also solved the fertilizer problem. In short, as long as the arrangements are proper, combining production with health campaigns is not only a win-win situation, but also has twice the result with half the effort.

What is the integration of science and technology with the mass movement? This requires the vast number of medical and health personnel to go deep into the masses and participate in the activities of eliminating pests and diseases together with the masses. In order to improve the work efficiency and quality of the health campaign, and to save labor and time, it is necessary to strengthen technical guidance to the masses and advocate the spirit of ingenuity. Combining the vast number of medical and health personnel with the masses, on the one hand, can deeply understand the production situation, the living conditions of the masses, and the problems existing in the movement, and put forward plans and methods in a timely manner for the leadership to refer to and play a role in advising; on the other hand, it can widely impart techniques for eliminating pests and diseases and paying attention to hygiene, and timely summarize and promote the inventions, creations and advanced experience of the masses, guide the masses to implement ingenuity, and be able to carry out health activities in combination with various production characteristics, so that the movement is consolidated and regular. Therefore, we hope that the vast number of medical and health personnel and Red Cross members who have mastered basic health knowledge will strengthen ties and unity with the masses. Red Cross members were originally health activists among the masses and capable assistants of the health department. They should set an example in the movement to eliminate pests and diseases and play a vanguard role; and under the guidance of medical personnel, they should organize the masses to learn, study and promote the technology of eliminating pests and diseases.

Eliminating the four pests and emphasizing hygiene is a matter involving everyone in the country. It is a great movement to change customs and habits and transform the country. It is a very arduous and glorious task, requiring the unremitting efforts of all the people, to make it known to every household and involve everyone. Therefore, we hope that all the deputies will always care about this movement when presiding over work and inspecting work, encourage and urge people to do a good job in hygiene, so that the great ideal of creating a "four nos" country called for by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao can be realized as soon as possible.

　　卫生为生产　生产讲卫生
    伍云甫、胡兰生、陈其瑗、刘清扬、浦化人委员的联合发言主席、各位委员：
    我们完全同意周恩来总理的政府工作报告和其他各位首长的报告。听了这些报告，我们非常兴奋。我们国家过去是“一穷二白”，现在，在短短几年之中，在经济和文化各方面就获得如此辉煌的成就，怎么不令人欢欣鼓舞啊！
    我们的事业越胜利，敌人就越要想办法来破坏我们。最近，原西藏地方政府上层反动分子在英帝国主义者和外国反动派的蛊惑煽动下，背叛祖国，破坏民族团结，发动武装叛乱。为了祖国的统一，为了西藏人民的幸福，我们坚决拥护政府平定叛乱的措施，并为叛乱的迅速平定而欢呼。西藏自古是中国的领土，处理西藏叛乱，是我国的内政，不许外国任何干涉。这些天，印度干涉主义分子不顾中印友谊，想利用西藏叛乱事件，把西藏从中国分裂出去。我们警告他们，你们的阴谋是永远不会实现的，如果你们要不顾一切继续蛮干下去，那你们只会在中国六亿人民的面前和全世界人民面前碰得头破血流，此外什么也得不到。
    我们是卫生工作者和红十字会工作者，现在就如何搞好卫生工作以促进工农业发展的问题，发表一点意见。
    一九五八年，随着工农业生产的大跃进，以爱国卫生运动为中心的卫生工作，也有了很大的发展，并在支援工农业生产方面起着显著的作用。在许多地方的总结中都有这样的说法：生产带动了卫生工作，卫生工作促进了生产。一九五九年，工农业生产任务比一九五八年更为繁重，为了保证工农业生产任务的完成，更要做好卫生工作，继续开展除害灭病的卫生运动，加强人民公社和厂矿工地集体生活的卫生措施，大力防止季节传染病的发生和流行。
    根据历年来特别是一九五八年的经验，要做好这些工作，除了要坚决依靠党的领导，认真贯彻群众路线以外，必须抓住两个关键：第一是卫生工作与生产相结合，第二是科学技术与群众运动相结合。
    什么是卫生工作与生产相结合呢？就是卫生为生产服务，生产要讲究卫生，根据生产的特点安排卫生活动，使卫生工作紧紧围绕着生产进行。因为搞好生产是当前全国人民的首要任务，是巩固人民公社、不断改善人民生活的根本措施，一切工作都必须服从生产的需要，以生产为中心结合进行，而不能妨碍生产。因此，卫生工作必须从生产出发，为生产服务，不能片面强调卫生重要，要求放下生产专搞卫生。不然，就会本末倒置。但是，要搞好生产，必须保护劳动者的健康，好劳动是同健康的身体分不开的。因此，在生产中还必须讲究卫生，把卫生工作当作搞好生产的措施之一。所以卫生工作与生产必须结合进行。不从生产出发，片面强调卫生，固然不对；如果只埋头搞生产不注意卫生工作，其结果，也会影响生产。历年来，由于搞好卫生增加生产的事例，不论在工业或农业方面都是很多的。武汉钢铁公司第二工程公司，由于大力开展卫生运动，基本达到“四无”、“五洁”，成为卫生模范单位，职工发病率一九五八年比一九五七年降低百分之五十七，出勤率提高百分之四，结果提前完成了年度生产计划，成为生产先进单位。浙江嵊县下田村，由于卫生工作搞得好，从一九五三年起全村没有人发生传染病，去年生产大跃进时，患伤风咳嗽的人也很少，出勤率达到百分之九十五以上，再加以积肥多及其他措施，全村水稻平均亩产一千斤以上，成为全面跃进的模范村。相反，由于卫生没有搞好而影响生产的，也有不少的教训。例如河北有一个县，生产本来很有成绩，但由于去年九、十月间对于工地集体生活场所卫生注意不够，蚊蝇孳生场所未认真清除，粪便垃圾处理得不好，饮水没有消毒和没有注意饮食卫生，加以发现疾病没有及时报告和处理，结果多种病流行起来，据五个村调查：脑炎、痢疾、百日咳、流感、伤寒、副伤寒等疾病总的发病人数，达到当地人口百分之十三到百分之二十，大大降低了出勤率和劳动效率，影响生产；后来由于党委适当抓紧了卫生工作，情况又好转起来。这些事例充分说明，搞好除害灭病的卫生运动确是提高生产的一项重要因素。正如有些群众说的：“健康是生产的资本，无病是跃进的保证”。
    生产一定要讲究卫生
    从目前情况看来，对于卫生工作要为生产服务问题，一般说来已经解决了。但是，对于生产要讲究卫生的问题，还有一些人在思想认识上没有完全解决，这些人害怕发动群众搞卫生运动就会耽误生产，没有将卫生工作与生产结合起来，生产稍紧张就放下卫生工作。这是当前某些地区卫生运动搞得不够好的主要原因。我们认为这是当前亟需研究解决的问题。开展卫生运动特别是大规模的突击，确实要占用一些劳力和时间。但对这个问题应该辩证地来看，既要看到矛盾的一面，又要看到统一的一面；既要看见眼前，也要看到长远。从眼前看，开展除害灭病运动要拿出一部分人力，对于生产是矛盾；但其结果却是增加更多的劳力，提高劳动出勤率和劳动效率。江西省宁都县在一九五八年十二月到今年一月间，开展了一次大规模的除害灭病运动，共用去十万个劳动日，这对于当时的生产来说，是有一定的影响；但是，由于通过这次运动基本上消灭了性病、头癣、丝虫病、钩虫病、疟疾等五病，治愈了大批病人，投入生产，折算下来一年就可以增加一百多万个劳动日。而且这不仅是一年半载的好处，而是给子孙万代造福的大事。问题在于领导上的统筹安排。如果领导上统筹安排得好，将卫生工作与生产密切结合起来，就是发动较多的群众搞卫生运动，也不会耽误生产，反会促进生产。武钢第二工程公司所以能够在生产和卫生上都成为先进单位，就是由于密切结合生产安排了卫生工作。他们的方法是：将工地卫生与安全生产结合起来；将环境卫生与开展副业生产（养鱼）和绿化结合起来；将车间卫生与维护生产设备结合起来；将饮食卫生与改善伙食结合起来。在农业方面开展卫生运动的途径更多，例如，结合积肥开展清洁扫除和铲除蚊蝇孳生场所，结合兴修水利进行灭蚊灭螺工作，等等。特别是结合积肥开展卫生运动，是非常有效的办法。今年春季，许多地区抓住积肥高潮，开展“卫生村”、“卫生之家”等等活动，既搞好了卫生，又解决了肥料问题。总之，只要安排得当，结合生产开展卫生运动，不仅是一举两得，而且有事半功倍之效。
    什么是科学技术与群众运动相结合呢？这就要求广大的医药卫生人员深入群众，和群众在一起进行除害灭病的活动。为了提高卫生运动的工作效率和质量，为了节省劳力和时间，必须加强对群众的技术指导和提倡巧干精神。广大医药卫生人员与群众结合起来，一方面可以深入了解生产情况、群众生活情况以及运动中存在的问题，及时提出计划和办法，供领导参考，发挥参谋作用；一方面可以广泛传授除害灭病和讲卫生的技术，及时总结和推广群众的发明创造和先进经验，引导群众实行巧干，并能够结合各种生产特点开展卫生活动，使运动巩固经常。因此，我们希望广大的医药卫生人员以及掌握有初级卫生知识的红十字会员，加强联系和团结群众。红十字会员原是群众中的卫生积极分子，卫生部门的得力助手，应该在除害灭病运动中处处以身作则，发挥尖兵作用；并在医务人员的指导下，组织群众学习、钻研和推广除害灭病的技术。
    除四害、讲卫生，是涉及全国每一个人的事情，是移风易俗、改造国家的伟大运动，是一项非常艰巨而光荣的任务，需要全体人民坚持不懈的努力，要做到家喻户晓，人人动手。因此，我们希望各位委员在主持工作和视察工作时，经常关怀这个运动，鼓励和督促人们做好卫生工作，使党中央和毛主席所号召的创造一个“四无”国家的伟大理想及早实现。
