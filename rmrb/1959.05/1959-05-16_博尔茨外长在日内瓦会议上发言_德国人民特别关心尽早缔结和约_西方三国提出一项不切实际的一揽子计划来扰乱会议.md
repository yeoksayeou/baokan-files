Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, May 15th (TASS dispatch from Geneva, May 14th): French Foreign Minister Couve de Murville served as the Executive Chairman of the Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference on the 14th. The first to speak at the meeting was US Secretary of State Herter. On behalf of the United States, Britain, and France, he submitted a proposal for a so-called "peace plan" for discussion at the conference.

\tIn presenting this plan, Herter first made an explanation which shows that the proposals of the Western three countries are based on stale concepts, which do not take into account the reality of the existence of two sovereign Germanies, and completely ignore the legitimate right of the German people to solve the problem of German unification themselves.

\tHerter said that the German question is not the only problem that "has been troubling the people of all countries since 1955." Herter pointed out that the proposals of the Western three countries cover a series of issues related to guaranteeing European security, such as the prohibition of the production of chemical, biological, and nuclear weapons, the general reduction of troops and armaments to agreed levels, and the adoption of measures to prevent sudden attacks in agreed areas around the world.

\tIt is evident that the proposals of the United States, Britain, and France violate the agreement reached by the four countries on the tasks and agenda of the Foreign Ministers' Conference, because the Western three countries proposed to discuss many complex international issues simultaneously. However, doing so would hinder the speedy resolution of the issue of a peace treaty with Germany, which could pave the way for resolving other major issues of strengthening peace and the security of all peoples.

\tIn outlining the Western countries' proposals, Herter said that the unification of Germany should first be restored through elections. Herter said, "We agree to arrange contacts between Eastern and Western Germans before the elections to discuss the methods of election." During the so-called preparatory period, "active measures" should be taken "in the area of European security" according to the Western countries' plan. As for the peace treaty with Germany, its signing will be postponed indefinitely according to the three countries' plan. The plan put forward by Herter also proves that the Western countries are attempting to maintain the occupation regime in West Berlin.

\tNevertheless, Herter insisted that the Western three countries have made great concessions to the Soviet Union's views. He also said that the United States, Britain, and France believe that both the Soviet Union's proposals and the plans put forward by the Western countries should be discussed in secret.

\tCouve de Murville and Lloyd spoke, saying that they fully supported the plan presented by Herter and all of Herter's opinions on the plan.

\tThen, Foreign Minister Bolz, head of the delegation of the German Democratic Republic, spoke. Bolz said in his speech, "I am honored to speak at this Foreign Ministers' Conference on behalf of the government and people of the German Democratic Republic. You can be assured that the vast majority of Germans warmly welcome this negotiation between East and West. The international tension places a particularly heavy burden on the German people, and therefore, their greatest desire is that a solid and lasting peace can be established in Europe."

\tBolz said that for the first time since the end of military operations in Europe, representatives of the two Germanies are meeting with the foreign ministers of the major powers whose people were once attacked by German militarists and dragged into a terrible war. We, the representatives of the German Democratic Republic, solemnly declare at the beginning of our speech that the purpose of our entire policy and our participation in this conference is to forever eliminate the new threat to peace from German militarist forces, which is equally dangerous to the German people and the people of other countries. The people of all countries who once participated in the anti-Hitler alliance made countless sacrifices for this noble and great goal. I can say that the best sons and daughters of the German people and German anti-fascist patriots have also made various sacrifices to achieve this goal.

\tBolz continued, "German anti-fascists wholeheartedly welcomed the determination expressed by the anti-Hitler allied countries in the Potsdam Conference resolutions: to open a new era of peace in Europe by eliminating German fascism and militarism. Within the German Democratic Republic, the main principles of the Potsdam Agreement have been realized. Therefore, no one can accuse the German Democratic Republic of harboring revengeful thoughts, making territorial claims, or threatening the people of other European countries. This is by no means accidental. The German Democratic Republic is determined to spare no effort to safeguard the peace of the German people and eliminate the division of Germany. Peace is a primary, most important, and vital issue for the German people." Bolz emphasized that the German people are particularly concerned about concluding a peace treaty as soon as possible, because a peace treaty would give them lasting peace and enable them to fully enjoy the right to self-determination. We firmly believe that concluding a peace treaty with Germany is still a shortcut to overcoming the unfortunate division of Germany. The peace treaty should grant the two Germanies equal rights and equal obligations, so that it can lead to the rapprochement of the two Germanies.

\tThe peace treaty cannot but involve the issue of West Berlin, and therefore it can create the best conditions for a painless solution to this urgent issue.

\tBolz said, "In the course of the conference, I would like to take this opportunity to elaborate on the political program drafted by the government of the German Democratic Republic for the national revival of Germany - to make Germany a unified, democratic, and peace-loving country. This program contains the proposal to establish a confederation of the two Germanies. We believe that the two Germanies must hold negotiations. However, the proposals repeatedly made by the government of the German Democratic Republic to the government of the Federal Republic of Germany on this issue have not yielded results. I am entrusted by my government to declare on this solemn platform: it is not too late even now. In this hall, the delegations of the two Germanies are sitting at the same table participating in the Foreign Ministers' Conference on an equal footing. The delegation of the German Democratic Republic is willing to discuss all issues of the peace treaty with Germany and measures that help establish a unified, democratic, and peace-loving Germany with the delegation of the Federal Republic of Germany. In this way, the two Germanies will be able to make a significant contribution to achieving results at the conference that satisfy all parties."

\tRepresentative Grewe of the Federal Republic of Germany spoke after Bolz. He supported the proposals presented by Herter and pointed out that these proposals were formulated in close cooperation with the government of the Federal Republic of Germany.

\tGrewe avoided mentioning Bolz's statement expressing his willingness to hold talks with the Federal Republic of Germany.

\tThe next meeting will be held on the afternoon of the 15th.

### 博尔茨外长在日内瓦会议上发言  德国人民特别关心尽早缔结和约  西方三国提出一项不切实际的一揽子计划来扰乱会议

    博尔茨外长在日内瓦会议上发言
    德国人民特别关心尽早缔结和约
    西方三国提出一项不切实际的一揽子计划来扰乱会议
    新华社15日讯　据塔斯社日内瓦14日讯：日内瓦外长会议14日的执行主席是法国外长德姆维尔。第一个在会上发言的是美国国务卿赫脱。他以美国、英国和法国的名义把一项所谓“和平计划”的建议提交会议讨论。
  赫脱在陈述这个计划时先作了一项说明，从这项说明可以看出，西方三国的建议是以陈腐的观念为基础的，这个观念丝毫没有考虑到目前存在着两个主权的德国这个现实情况，并且完全忽视了德国人民有自己解决德国统一问题的合法权利。
    赫脱说，德国问题不是“自1955年以来各国人民耿耿于怀”的唯一问题。赫脱指出，西方三国的建议包揽了保障欧洲安全的一系列问题，像禁止生产化学武器、生物武器和核武器的问题，像把军队和军备普遍裁减到商定的水平问题，以及采取措施在全世界取得协议的地区防止突然袭击的问题等等。
    由此可见，美国、英国和法国的建议违背了四国就外长会议的任务和日程所达成的协议，因为西方三国建议规定要同时讨论许多复杂的国际问题。可是这样做会妨碍迅速地解决对德和约问题，而对德和约能够为解决加强和平和各国人民安全的其他重大问题开辟道路。
    赫脱在大致说明西方国家的建议时说，首先是应该通过选举来恢复德国的统一。赫脱说，我们同意在选举前安排东部和西部德国人的接触以便讨论选举方法问题。在赫脱所谓的准备时期内，要按照西方国家的计划“在欧洲安全方面”采取“积极措施”。至于谈到对德和约，那末按照三国计划，它的签订将被无限期拖延下去。赫脱提出的计划还证明西方国家企图保持西柏林的占领制度。
    虽然如此，可是赫脱硬说，西方三国大大迁就了苏联的观点。他还说，美国、英国、法国认为，无论是苏联的建议，或是西方国家提出的计划都应该秘密讨论。
    德姆维尔和劳埃德发言说，他们完全支持赫脱提出的计划和赫脱关于这个计划的一切意见。
    然后，由德意志民主共和国代表团团长、外交部长博尔茨发言。博尔茨在发言中首先说，我代表德意志民主共和国政府和人民在这次外长会议上发言，感到荣幸。你们可以相信，绝大多数德国人对东西方的这次谈判表示衷心欢迎。国际紧张局势加给德国人民的负担特别沉重，因此，他们最渴望的莫过于欧洲最终将能建立巩固而持久的和平。
    博尔茨说，在欧洲的军事行动结束以后，两个德国的代表第一次同大国外交部长会晤，这些国家的人民曾经遭到德国军国主义者的进攻，并且被德国军国主义者拖入了一场可怕的战争。我们，德意志民主共和国的代表在开始发言的时候首先庄严声明：我们的整个政策和我们参加这次会议的目的是，永远消除德国军国主义势力对和平的新的威胁，这种威胁对德国人民和其他各国人民是同样危险的。曾经参加反希特勒同盟的各国人民为了这个崇高而伟大的目标作出了无数的牺牲。我可以说，德国人民的优秀儿女、德国反法西斯的爱国者为了实现这个目的也作出了种种牺牲。
    博尔茨接着说，德国反法西斯者衷心地欢迎反希特勒同盟国在波茨坦会议的决议中表示的决心：即通过肃清德国法西斯主义和军国主义的办法开辟欧洲的和平纪元。在德意志民主共和国境内，波茨坦协定的主要原则已经实现。因此，谁也不能指责德意志民主共和国，说它有复仇思想，说它提出领土要求或威胁其他欧洲各国人民，这决不是偶然的。德意志民主共和国决心不遗余力地来保障德国人民的和平和消除德国的分裂状态。和平对德国人民来说是首要的、最重要的切身问题。博尔茨强调说，德国人民特别关心尽早缔结和约，因为和约会给他们以持久和平，并能使他们充分享有自决权利。我们坚信，缔结对德和约还是克服德国不幸分裂的一条捷径。和约应给予两个德国以平等的权利和平等的义务，这样，就能导致两个德国的接近。
    和约无论如何不能不涉及西柏林的问题，因此它能创造最好的条件无痛苦地解决这个刻不容缓的问题。
    博尔茨说，在会议的过程中，我愿意利用这个机会来详细地陈述德意志民主共和国政府草拟的德国民族复兴——使德国成为一个统一、民主和爱好和平的国家——的政治纲领。这个纲领包含着建立两个德国的邦联的主张。我们认为，两个德国必须举行谈判。但是，德意志民主共和国政府就这问题一再向德意志联邦共和国政府提出的建议没有获得成果。我受本国政府的委托在这个崇高的讲坛上声明：现在也还不晚。在这个大厅里，两个德国的代表团坐在同样的桌子上以平等的地位参加外长会议，德意志民主共和国的代表团愿意同德意志联邦共和国的代表团讨论对德和约的一切问题以及有助于建立统一、民主和爱好和平的德国的措施。这样，两个德国就能够在使会议获得使各方都满意的结果方面作出重大的贡献。
    德意志联邦共和国代表格雷韦在博尔茨之后发言。他支持赫脱所陈述的建议，并且指出，这些建议是同德意志联邦共和国政府密切合作制定的。
    格雷韦避而不谈博尔茨表示愿意同德意志联邦共和国会谈的上述声明。
    下次会议将于15日下午举行。
