    海南岛准备收割早稻
    新华社广州15日电　海南岛早稻丰收在望。岛上各人民公社正在为迎接夏收进行紧张的准备工作。
    由于夏收时间紧迫，农活错综复杂，各地都在抓紧进行工具改革，以解决劳动力不足的困难。乐东县有一千六百多人投入工具改革工作，新制和修理了牛车四千六百多架，打谷机七百八十多台，同时整修了一百八十多条牛车路。争取夏熟作物快收、快打、快运。海口市郊各公社也在短时间内新制和修理了七千多部快速收割器、九千多部打谷机和大批的牛车。与此同时，各公社的手工业部门还赶编了一批竹器用具，支援夏收。
    为了加强夏收粮食的保管工作，海南岛各人民公社都整修了仓库，海口市东山公社还在仓库里普遍进行一次消毒。有的公社调整了粮食保管，加强仓库管理工作。各地在准备夏收工作时，还制订收割公约，争取做到颗粒还家。
