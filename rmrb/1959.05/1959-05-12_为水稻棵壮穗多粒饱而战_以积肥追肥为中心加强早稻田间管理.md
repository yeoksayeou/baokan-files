    Fight for Strong Rice Plants with Big Ears and Full Grains:
    Strengthen Early Rice Field Management with a Focus on Manure Accumulation and Topdressing
    Guangxi Provinces

    Recently, the rural areas of the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region have launched a massive fertilizer grab, preparing sufficient topdressing for early rice and late autumn crops. At dawn, in villages and fields everywhere, groups of people are making compost, fermenting pond manure, collecting cow dung, sweeping pigsties, and burning wood leaves. At night, the local fertilizer factories in every village and team are brightly lit, and people are still working non-stop to produce fertilizer. According to statistics from the four special districts of Yulin, Nanning, Wuzhou, and Baise, by the 6th, 1.33 billion dan of summer manure had been accumulated.

    After spring sowing and spring transplanting, the amount of fertilizer currently available in various parts of Guangxi is not large, especially the amount of fine fertilizer needed for weeding and topdressing is very small. In view of this situation, Party committees at all levels in the autonomous region have emphasized the need to earnestly grasp the work of accumulating and producing fertilizer in field management. On the basis of deeply mobilizing the masses, various places have properly arranged labor. Many communes have invested more than 60% of their agricultural production labor in fertilizer accumulation and topdressing, and have adopted methods of contracting for quantity, quality, time, and awarding bonuses for exceeding quotas, distributing tasks to brigades, production teams, and individuals at each level.

    Many communes have also formulated plans for accumulating and producing various fertilizers according to the different conditions of crops and geology, so that whatever fertilizer is needed is available. After field identification, the Mapo Brigade of the Red Star Commune made specific plans to apply topdressing to the few rice seedlings that were in danger of lodging, had weak root systems, insufficient base fertilizer, and few tillers, and decided to cultivate these seedlings into first-class seedlings.

    In the manure accumulation movement, all localities have paid attention to opening up fertilizer sources according to local conditions. Mountainous and semi-mountainous areas have taken advantage of the current period of lush vegetation to vigorously collect green manure for composting; plain areas have focused on fermenting pond manure and making compost; and areas near rivers and water have accumulated fertilizer by collecting aquatic plants. The Luopu and Pingshan communes in Luozhai County, based on their specific local conditions, proposed eight methods of accumulating fertilizer, including "burning, digging, fermenting, manufacturing, shoveling, cutting, accumulating, and collecting." Guanheng Commune in Pingnan County is located near mountains and ridges, and Mo Ruoming, the secretary of the commune's Party committee, personally led more than 1,800 commune members to Sanbao Mountain, which is covered in lush greenery, to accumulate fertilizer. They worked hard for seven days, traversing several mountain ranges.

    Various localities have also stepped up the production of local chemical fertilizers. Luozhai County recently built and newly constructed more than 600 local chemical fertilizer factories.

    Hunan Hengnan

    Changsha, May 11th (Our Newspaper) - Hengnan County, Hunan Province, is carrying out an early and mid-season rice field management campaign centered on fertilizer accumulation, production, and topdressing. Currently, 60,000 laborers are involved in this campaign, accounting for 40% of the agricultural labor force. The county has accumulated and produced more than 18 million dan of various quick-acting fertilizers.

    After the basic completion of early and mid-season rice transplanting in Hengnan County, the county Party committee, on the one hand, organized various communes to carry out inspection, evaluation, and competition activities for field management; on the other hand, it organized working groups to go deep into the Jilongjie and Yueping communes to conduct key investigations on the growth of rice seedlings and fertilization. Through comprehensive inspection and key investigation, it was found that there were still 180,000 mu of rice fields in the county that had not turned green after being transplanted for ten and a half months, and some had turned yellow after turning green. The communes and production brigades checked while consulting experienced farmers on the spot to observe the condition of the rice seedlings and analyze the reasons. These fields with slow greening were roughly of the following types: First, the fields that were plowed deeply had new soil layers turned up, and the fertilizer applied was insufficient; second, the fields where rice seedlings were transplanted late; third, the fields that were originally intended for rotation had insufficient fertilizer preparation, but were later planted; fourth, remote fields, autumn-turned fields, muddy fields, and cold-soaked fields; fifth, fields with heavy clay soil. According to the experience of local farmers, to change this slow-greening phenomenon, it is necessary to apply various quick-acting fertilizers according to the specific conditions of the fields. The communes and production teams arranged a certain amount of labor force according to the fertilizer needs of various types of rice seedlings and launched a summer blitz fertilizer accumulation campaign. In the manure accumulation movement, the communes and production brigades fully mobilized the masses and found many fertilizer sources. The Jilongjie, Maodongqiao, and other communes found a way to accumulate fertilizer through "one collection, two cuttings, three shoveling, five digging, six manufacturing, and six burning." One collection is to collect household manure; two cuttings are to cut green manure and grass; three shoveling is to shovel turf, field ridges, and field embankments; five digging is to dig mud from the bottom of cattle and pig pens, dig mud from urine buckets and toilets, dig thousands-of-leg mud, dig sludge, and dig peat mud; six manufacturing is to manufacture local phosphate and potash fertilizers, compost, pond manure, etc.; and six burning is to burn scorched earth, burn pot ashes, etc. to accumulate fertilizer.

    In the fertilizer accumulation and production movement, all localities also paid attention to collecting household fertilizer. In just a few days, the Linghu Commune collected more than 9,600 dan of household fertilizer. The Quansha Commune collected a total of more than 29,000 dan of human and animal manure in just four days, which was promptly applied to the fields, quickly promoting the greening of third-class rice seedlings. From May 1st to 4th, the county collected a total of more than 250,000 dan of household fertilizer.

    While mobilizing the masses to widely open up fertilizer sources, the communes also established various responsibility systems. The Santang, Tanzishan, and other communes also adopted methods such as three linkages, five guarantees, and six determinations. The three linkages are fertilizer linked to work points, fertilizer linked to wages, and fertilizer linked to rations; the five guarantees are guaranteed collection, guaranteed accumulation, guaranteed green manure cutting, guaranteed pond fermentation, and guaranteed manufacturing; and the six determinations are determining people, determining areas, determining tasks, determining time, determining quality, and determining rewards and punishments. Through these methods, the sense of responsibility of the commune members was strengthened, and the enthusiasm for accumulating fertilizer was improved.

    The communes and production brigades, while blitzing fertilizer accumulation and production, applied topdressing to the fields. By the 5th, more than 180,000 mu of third-class rice seedlings in the county had generally been topdressed with a quick-acting nitrogen fertilizer once, and a large part of them had begun to turn green.

    为水稻棵壮穗多粒饱而战
    以积肥追肥为中心加强早稻田间管理
    广西各地
    新华社南宁9日电　　广西僮族自治区农村最近掀起了声势浩大的夺肥大战，为早稻和大秋作物准备足够的追肥。清晨，各地农村的村头田间，到处都有制堆肥、沤凼肥、拾牛屎、扫猪舍、烧木叶的人群。入夜，村村队队的土化肥厂灯火辉煌，人们还在不停地生产。据玉林、南宁、梧州、百色四个专区的统计，到6日止，夏季积肥十三亿三千万担。
    春播、春插以后，广西各地现存的肥料，为数不多，特别是耘田追肥所需要的精肥很少。根据这种情况，自治区各级党委在田间管理工作中，都强调了要切实抓好积肥造肥工作。各地在深入发动群众的基础上，妥善地安排了劳力，许多公社用60％以上的农业生产劳动力，投入积肥、追肥工作中，并且采取包数量、包质量、包时间和超额奖励的办法，把任务层层分配到大队、生产队和个人。
    不少公社还根据作物和地质情况不同制订了积、造各种肥料的规划，做到要什么肥就有什么肥。红星公社马坡大队，经过田头鉴定后，对少数倒伏危险、根系不旺、基肥不足、土质不肥的分蘖少的禾苗，都作了具体的施加追肥计划，决定把这些禾苗培育成一类苗。
    各地在积肥运动中，都注意因地制宜地开辟肥源，山区和半山区利用当前草木茂盛的时期，大抓采青沤肥；平原地区抓沤凼肥，做堆肥；靠河近水地区，用捞水草方法积肥。鹿寨县洛埠、平山等公社，根据本地的具体条件，提出了“烧、挖、沤、制、铲、割、积、收”等八种积肥方法。平南县官成公社近山靠岭，公社党委书记莫若明亲自率领一千八百多个社员，到万绿丛生的三宝山驻山积肥，苦战七天，走遍了几个山岭。
    各地还加紧了土化肥的生产，鹿寨县最近即修建和新建了六百多个土化肥厂。
    湖南衡南
    本报长沙11日电　湖南衡南县正开展一个以积肥、制肥和追肥为中心的早、中稻田间管理运动。目前，投入这一运动的劳动力有六万人，占农业劳力的40％，全县已积制各种速效肥料一千八百多万担。
    衡南县早、中稻插秧基本结束后，县委一方面组织各公社开展田间管理工作的检查评比竞赛运动；另一方面又组织工作组，深入到鸡笼街、岳屏两个公社，对禾苗生长和施肥情况作了重点调查。通过全面检查和重点调查，发现全县还有十八万亩稻田，插下去十天半个月，还没转青，有的转了青又发黄了。各公社、生产大队一边检查，一面找老农临田察看禾苗情况，分析原因。这些转青慢的田，大约有以下几种：一是犁得深的田，翻上了新土层，肥料又下得不足；二是秧苗插得迟的田；三是原来打算轮休的田，肥料准备不足，后来又种上了；四是边远田、翻秋田、泮泥田、冷浸田；五是土质粘性重的田。根据各地老农的经验，要改变这种转青慢的现象，必须因田制宜，追施各种速效肥料。各公社、生产队根据各类田禾苗的需肥情况，安排了一定的劳动力，开展了夏季突击积肥运动。在积肥运动中，各公社、生产大队充分发动群众，找到了许多肥源。鸡笼街、茅洞桥等公社找出一收、二刈、三铲、五挖、六造、六烧的积肥门路。一收是收集家肥；二刈是刈青、刈草；三铲是铲草皮、铲田塍、铲田墈；五挖是挖牛猪栏底泥、挖尿桶厕所泥、挖千脚泥、挖污泥、挖草炭泥；六造是造土制磷钾肥、造堆肥、造凼肥等；六烧是烧焦土、烧锅底灰等积肥。
    在积肥造肥运动中，各地还注意了收集家肥。酃湖公社几天时间就收集了九千六百多担家肥。泉洒公社仅四天时间收人畜屎共两万九千多担，及时追到田里，很快促使三类禾苗转青。全县从5月1日到4日，共收集家肥二十五万多担。
    各公社在发动群众广辟肥源的同时，还建立了各种责任制。三塘、谭子山等公社还采取了三挂钩、五包、六定等办法，三挂钩是肥料与工分挂钩、肥料与工资挂钩、肥料与口粮挂钩；五包是包收、包积、包采青、包沤凼、包制造，六定是定人、定地区、定任务、定时间、定质量、定奖罚。通过这些办法，加强了社员责任心，提高了积肥积极性。
    各公社、生产大队一边突击积肥制肥，一边追肥下田，到5日止，全县十八万多亩三类苗已普遍追施了一次速效氮肥，已有很大一部分开始转青了。
