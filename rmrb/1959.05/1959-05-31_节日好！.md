Xinhua News Agency, May 30th. One thousand two hundred children of all nationalities in the capital held a bonfire party in the ancient cypress forest of the Children's Palace tonight to celebrate their own holiday.

    As the sunset melted into the blue sky, the Young Pioneers' bonfire blazed. The raging flames leaped, dyeing everything around red. The colorful lanterns hanging on the pine and cypress trees and the stars in the sky complemented each other. Children of all ethnic groups sang and danced to their heart's content in this beautiful realm, congratulating each other with "Happy Holiday!"
    A child dressed up as "Grandpa Pine Tree" congratulated the children on the holiday in a loud voice in the crowd. He said: "I hope you study hard, love labor, exercise, and always be full of vigor. Can you do it?" The children excitedly replied: "Yes!"
    When the Tibetan children participating in the party entered the venue, children of all ethnic groups, including Han, Mongolian, Uyghur, Zhuang, and Korean, warmly applauded to welcome them. "Grandpa Pine Tree" said loudly: "The rebellion launched by the reactionary elements of the upper class in Tibet has been quelled, and the Tibetan people will embark on the road of democracy and socialism more quickly. Let us warmly celebrate the new life of the Tibetan people!" The loudspeaker broadcast Tibetan music, and the Tibetan Young Pioneers wearing red scarves and colorful clothes danced the "Rural Labor Dance" symbolizing peace and harvest. Children of all ethnic groups in their respective national costumes also danced their own national dances. Zhang Weimin, an outstanding Young Pioneer and a student from the Second Affiliated Elementary School of Beijing Second Normal School, danced with Tuden Gesang, a Tibetan Young Pioneer. Zhang Weimin said to Tuden Gesang: "Tibet is going to carry out democratic reforms, and I am as happy as you are!" Tuden Gesang said: "We have suffered from the reactionary serf system, and from now on, everything will be fine!" A group of children surrounded a Tibetan girl, Dege Yangjin, took out their notebooks, and asked her to write down her name and address in the notebooks, so that they could become good friends with this girl.
    One of the programs at the party was the "Flower Fairy" and the twelve "Flower Kings" congratulating everyone on the holiday. The girls dressed up as "Flower Fairy" and the twelve "Flower Kings", and walked out of the flowers when everyone was in high spirits. The "Flower Fairy" waved her light gauze, and the twelve "Flower Kings" scattered seeds of happiness behind her.
    Late at night, the bonfire party ended in the children's singing of "Socialism is Good."

    节日好！
    新华社30日讯　首都各民族的少年儿童一千二百人今晚在少年宫古老的松柏林里举行营火晚会，庆祝自己的节日。
    当晚霞溶化在蓝色天空里的时候，少先队的营火燃烧起来了。熊熊的火苗跳跃着，把周围的一切都染成了红色。挂在松柏树上的各色彩灯和天上的繁星交相辉映。各族儿童在这美丽的境界里纵情歌舞，互相祝贺“节日好！”
    一个孩子化装成“松树公公”，在人群里高声向小朋友们祝贺节日。他说：“我希望你们用功读书，热爱劳动、锻炼身体、永远朝气勃勃。你们能不能作到？”小朋友们兴奋地回答说：“能！”
    参加晚会的藏族小朋友走进会场时，汉族、蒙古族、维吾尔族、僮族、朝鲜族等各民族的小朋友热烈鼓掌欢迎他们。“松树公公”大声说：“西藏上层反动分子发动的叛乱已经平息了，西藏人民将要更快地走上民主和社会主义的大道。让我们热烈地庆祝西藏人民的新生吧！”扩音器播送着藏族的乐曲，带着红领巾的藏族少先队员穿着彩衣，跳起了象征着和平和丰收的“农村劳动舞”。穿着各民族服装的各族儿童也跳起本民族的舞来。优秀的少先队员、北京第二师范学校第二附属小学的学生张维敏拉着藏族少先队员土登格桑一起跳舞。张维敏对土登格桑说：“西藏要进行民主改革了，我也和你一样高兴！”土登格桑说：“我们受尽了反动的农奴制度的苦难，从今以后就好了！”一群孩子围着一个藏族小姑娘得给央金，掏出了自己的小本子，请她在本子上记下名字和地址，他们要和这姑娘结成好朋友。
    晚会上有一个节目是“百花仙子”和十二个月的“花王”向大家贺节。女孩子们化装成“百花仙子”和十二个月的“花王”，在大家舞兴正浓的时候从花丛里走了出来，“百花仙子”挥舞着轻纱，十二个月的“花王”在她的后面撒下了幸福的种子。
    夜深了，营火晚会在孩子们欢唱“社会主义好”的歌声中结束。
