Chairman, fellow delegates:

I am Wang Guofan, formerly known as the leader of the "poor stick cooperative." Today, I want to talk about how a group of "poor sticks," under the leadership of the Party, relied on their own efforts and hard work, developing from three donkey legs to tractors running everywhere today; from originally relying on the government for more than two million jin of grain annually, to selling four million jin of grain to the state in 1958; that is, about persisting in implementing the Party's policy of diligently and frugally running the commune. I will report some of the situation to the conference for your criticism and guidance. If we talk about being poor in the past, that is absolutely true. Our Xisili Township is located on the eastern side of Zunhua County, a mountain village at the foot of the Great Wall. Ninety percent of the land is hillside and terraced fields hanging on the mountainside. In the past, one mu of land could only yield sixty or seventy jin of grain a year, and more than ninety percent of the households in the village lacked food and clothing. The twenty-three households that initially joined the cooperative in 1952 were either hired laborers or beggars in the past. Therefore, when the cooperative was first established, we only had 230 mu of land distributed during the land reform and three donkey legs made up of one-quarter to one-third shares of several donkeys. We had nothing else needed for production. Seeing our situation, the well-to-do middle peasants said some unpleasant things, calling us the "poor stick cooperative," and also tried to outdo us in production. Some even said that we didn't have the ability to pick stars from the sky, so we shouldn't even think about catching up with them. All these things were seen by all the members and kept in their hearts. At that time, there were a total of nineteen male members in the cooperative, who all firmly said: As long as we have lofty ambitions, we will definitely be able to pick the stars! With our thirty-eight hands, we must surpass them in production. In this way, we had ambition, and we also had the courage and methods to overcome difficulties. Without livestock and farm tools, we went to the mountains to collect firewood to exchange for them; if some members didn't have enough food, they accommodated each other; if everyone didn't have enough food, they sent some people to cut grass to exchange for food. The grass was cheap, and there were many people, so the grain exchanged was little, so they let the members share it first. In the face of such serious difficulties, a few members sometimes showed a little wavering, advocating borrowing money from the state or asking for relief. However, after discussing these opinions, everyone said: Our country is so big, how can we carry out construction if we all rely on relief and loans? We are determined to grit our teeth and get through this.

Production Developed, Attention Should Still Be Paid to Thrift

After a year of hard work, our agricultural output increased by a lot, and the average grain yield per mu reached 174 jin, which was 21 jin higher than the highest yield per unit area of the well-to-do middle peasants. By chopping firewood, cutting grass, we exchanged for an iron-wheeled cart, a cow, two mules, thirty sheep and some odd farm tools. Facts have proved that hard work can create wealth. This is just as Chairman Mao taught us: "As long as these people control their own destiny and have a Marxist-Leninist line, not evading problems, but solving problems with a positive attitude, any difficulties in the world can always be solved."

People's minds are constantly changing with the changing conditions. For example, the first year after the establishment of the cooperative was a good harvest, and some members believed that this time they had laid a good foundation, and there would be capital for production next year! Some members also said: "We have been competing with the middle peasants in production on an empty stomach for a year, and now it is time to compare our lives with them!" Faced with these two different paths, which one should we take? We mobilized the members to discuss. During the discussion, the members made an interesting analogy: Production is like a "rake," savings are like a "box," and waste is like a "fork." When the "rake" gathers things in, and the "box" accumulates them, they can be taken by hand; when the "rake" gathers things in, and the "fork" picks them out, there is nothing left when you need it. Through this discussion, the members understood that in order to turn over economically, they had to work hard and be thrifty; only by constantly developing production could life be improved.

After solving the relationship between production and life, the cooperative also often emphasized that thrift should be considered from the big picture and started from the small things. During the autumn harvest of 1954, we calculated an account with the members: the cooperative had 300 mu of peanuts, and if one fruit was dropped in each handful, 5,100 jin would be lost. The male members said: Guarantee that when digging peanuts, every handful will "see the hoe on three sides," and the female members said, "We must scrape out a rubber-wheeled cart from meticulous harvesting!" Sure enough, from the autumn of this year to the beginning of winter, through meticulous harvesting, chopping firewood, cutting grass..., we did not borrow a penny from the state and added two more large mules and two rubber-wheeled carts.

In order to eliminate all kinds of unnecessary expenses, we learned from Comrade Geng Changsuo's cooperative's financial contract system and contracted the farm tool repair costs to the teams. Some middle peasant members said: "A team that plants more than 200 mu of land only gets 30 yuan for repair costs for wheels, plows, covers, etc. per year. What can they do? If they only get so little money, then the cooperative will have to buy new ones!" This kind of thinking was opposed by everyone. The members said: "Our furniture could be used before we joined the cooperative, and it can still be used now, so there is no need to buy new ones. The property of the cooperative is like a pit of water, accumulated bit by bit, and not a penny can be wasted. As long as it can be used now, don't buy new ones."

Cannot Be Satisfied with the Status Quo, Must Continue to Work Hard

With the increase in income and the gradual enrichment of life, some people began to be satisfied with the status quo, loafing around, and not actively participating in cooperative labor. In the spring of 1957, several young people often absented themselves from work. When the team leader asked them to go to work, they said: I will work less and get less dividends. We now have grain in the warehouse and money in the bank, and we can't starve to death even if we don't work for a month. The branch studied this situation and asked me to have a discussion with them. I asked them how their lives were now, and they all said they were much better than before. I asked again: "Why can life be better now?" They said: "It is created by labor!" I said: "How did your grandfathers and fathers work in the past?" They all rushed to say that their elders worked well. I said: "That's strange. The old people worked for the landlords and rich peasants, working more than 360 labor days a year, and they didn't create a good life for a lifetime. Why can we create a good life in a few years?" The young men were stunned, and then said: "Now we have the leadership of the Communist Party and have taken the road of collectivization. We must run the cooperative well in the future, actively labor, and increase grain and industrial raw materials to support the country's industrial construction."

Cannot Forget the Pain After the Sore Is Healed, Cannot Forget the Roots After Turning Over

After solving the ideological problem of being satisfied with the status quo, we discovered that individual members had a tendency to forget their roots. For example, member Gao Jinquan had been begging for more than ten years. After joining the cooperative in the winter of 1953, his family of six laborers earned more than 400 yuan in cash every year in addition to eating grain. By 1957, he had built a new house with five main rooms and three wing rooms, and bought two bicycles. The family of twelve, except for three children, had two sets of new quilts per person. It was a glorious thing to become rich from poor by relying on one's own hands, but for a time, he was unhappy when others mentioned the past, thinking that it was too embarrassing to talk about being poor in the past, etc. After education, he has changed his past views, and he is working even harder. This fact shows that ideological education work must be strengthened. After the communization, the commune Party committee summarized our past deeds of diligently and frugally running the cooperative and becoming rich, and widely publicized them among the members. They also arranged these materials in a "Jianming Commune History Museum" (the three donkey legs of the twenty-three households when the primary cooperative was first established will also be placed in the history museum when the donkey dies). Let the members see things and be moved, and improve their class consciousness by recalling the past, and more actively implement the principles of diligently and frugally running the commune and diligently and frugally managing the family.

In the past few years, all the members have increased production on the one hand and saved money on the other hand, investing more than 60,000 yuan in the cooperative and depositing more than 30,000 yuan in the bank, supporting production and construction.

In the entire process of adhering to diligently and frugally running the cooperative, we always remember the Party's teachings: integrate with the masses, "discuss things with the masses, endure hardships first, and enjoy later." The cadres take the lead in production and, like the members, earn work points and dividends based on their labor. This approach has a great impact on the members, making the members know that the cadres are for everyone, not for themselves. Although the leaders and comrades from all walks of life often give us great care and encouragement, we soberly know that our achievements are still far from enough, and we must never be complacent, and we must continue to learn from the brother cooperatives across the country. We have learned from Changli's "Houliangshan Cooperative" in managing fruit trees, Anguo's garden-style cultivation, and Shandong Shimen Song Township's pig raising and other advanced experiences. We will never forget Chairman Mao's words: "Modesty makes people progress, and pride makes people fall behind." If you are not modest, you will not be able to adhere to the principle of diligently and frugally running the cooperative.

Fellow delegates! If we have made achievements in adhering to diligently and frugally running the cooperative, it is that we have consolidated the cooperative, developed production, and improved our lives. By the eve of the communization movement in 1958, we had accumulated more than 470,000 yuan worth of public property, mainly: 1,000 sheep, 157 cattle, 12 mules, 4 horses, 11 rubber-wheeled carts, 19 iron-wheeled carts, a 25-horsepower tractor, a 5-kilowatt generator, and cultivated more than 4,000 mu of pine mountains, 800 mu of river beach forests, and more than 57,000 various fruit trees, of which more than 27,000 have begun to bear fruit. In addition, we have also dug 18 water wells and opened 6 canals, turning more than 2,000 mu of dry land into irrigated land. It can be said that we have turned over economically.

Complete the People's Communization, More People and More Power Can Conquer Heaven

In 1958, the Party Central Committee put forward the "General Line of Going All Out, Aiming High, and Building Socialism with Greater, Faster, Better, and More Economical Results," which gave the members great encouragement. Everyone competed to overcome the unprecedented drought and the once-in-a-century storm, and won an unprecedented bumper harvest. The original Jianming Cooperative's four villages averaged 700 jin of grain per mu, an increase of nine times compared to the average of 70 jin per mu in 1952, reaching 1,000 jin per person. The average yield of cotton per mu was 60 jin of ginned cotton, plus the income from forestry, animal husbandry, fruit trees and household sideline occupations, the average income per person reached 170 yuan. The members built more than 600 new houses, bought more than 130 bicycles and 13 sewing machines, and the phenomenon of no clothes or quilts and lack of clothes and quilts disappeared. Now: every village has telephones, every household listens to the radio, and four villages have lit electric lights.

From the practice of the Great Leap Forward, the members realized on the one hand that the potential for production is endless, but at the same time they also saw that although they worked hard day and night and made great efforts to ensure a good harvest, they still suffered certain losses after all. The crops suffered certain setbacks from the drought, and more than 100 mu of land were destroyed by mountain floods. If a reservoir is built in the gully to control the mountain floods and make them serve the water conservancy of the mountain areas, the output will be even greater. However, to achieve this, the strength of one advanced cooperative is not enough. The facts made us deeply feel that the advanced cooperatives of three or five villages could no longer meet the needs of continued development of production. Therefore, we discussed setting up people's communes. The members were all overjoyed and enthusiastically supported the idea of setting up communes. Our Jianming Cooperative merged with 32 local advanced cooperatives to form the Jianming People's Commune. The establishment of the people's commune showed great superiority. Under the unified leadership of the commune, the members divided the battle lines, launched surprise attacks separately, and completed heavy tasks such as mining, iron smelting, steel smelting, autumn harvest, and deep plowing of 8,000 mu of wheat on time. They opened 47 factories and workshops, and also built a reservoir that could hold 2.7 million cubic meters of water and irrigate more than 10,000 mu of land. They created unprecedented miracles. At this moment, some cadres and members believed that: After the communization, whether from the perspective of manpower, material resources, or financial resources, it is much stronger than the advanced cooperatives, and a bumper harvest has been obtained in production, so we can spend money more generously. Many production teams reached out to the commune for anything they needed that they could solve themselves. Shalingzi is a mountain village, and it is very convenient to use donkeys, but the cadres advocated selling the donkeys and exchanging them for mules and horses. The idea of extravagance is rising again.

Building Socialism, We Must Adhere to Diligently and Frugally Running the Commune

In response to the above situation, the commune Party committee carried out socialist and communist education using the methods of recalling and comparison. They unanimously realized that our current socialist construction is only the beginning of a happy life. To build socialism and enter the beautiful life of the communist era, we must continue to maintain and carry forward the glorious tradition of diligently and frugally running the commune taught by the Party, doing things without spending money, and doing more things with less money. The commune's transportation capacity was insufficient, and the members said: "In the past, we asked the mountains for livestock and carts, and today we want to ask the mountains for cars!" In just seven days, they chopped more than 1.78 million jin of firewood, worth more than 35,600 yuan, which could buy two large cars. In order to strive for a greater leap forward in 1959, the commune reduced non-productive expenditures, concentrated funds on production, and purchased five tractors, seven pot camel machines, and two 10-kilowatt hydro-generators, taking the first step towards the mechanization and electrification of agriculture.

Give Play to the Superiority of the Commune and Continue the Great Leap Forward This Year At this meeting, listening to the reports made by Premier Zhou, Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, made us more confident that we should strive for another great leap forward this year on the basis of last year's Great Leap Forward. We must give full play to the superior conditions of the people's commune, and according to the policy of combining industry and agriculture, plan to establish 17 kinds of small factories and workshops such as repair shops, farm tool factories, pesticide factories, and indigenous fertilizer factories. The total annual output value can reach more than 460,000 yuan; produce 17 kinds of products such as indigenous fertilizers, pesticides, and farm tools to support agricultural production; fully implement the Eight-Character Charter of Agriculture, and increase the grain yield per mu of the entire commune from more than 500 jin last year to about 1,000 jin. At the same time, the yield of cotton per mu will be increased to 100 jin of ginned cotton, and peanuts will be increased to 480 jin. We also plan to make full use of the natural conditions of the mountainous areas to vigorously develop forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations and fisheries, and strive for the all-round development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations and fisheries. In addition to planting more than 4,000 mu of forests on barren mountains and river beaches, we also plan to plant more than 2,000 mu of fruit trees, gradually realizing the afforestation of the land, the mulberry and fruit planting of terraced fields and slopes, and the shading of trees along rivers and roads. In terms of animal husbandry, in addition to vigorously increasing draught animals to support agricultural production, we must also use the two-pronged approach of collective feeding and individual feeding to develop pigs and sheep. The number of pigs and sheep in the entire commune will be rapidly increased from the existing 31,000 to 78,000. At the same time, we also encourage members to raise chickens, ducks, bees and rabbits in large numbers. Sideline production such as chopping firewood and cutting grass is an important way for our original Jianming Cooperative to start from scratch. This year, in addition to doing a good job in industry, agriculture and other productions, the commune still has to set aside slack farming time to carry out 40 kinds of sideline productions such as chopping firewood and weaving thorns to increase the income of the commune, teams and members. In addition, we also plan to use the newly built reservoir to raise 200,000 fish, opening up new avenues of production. After realizing these leap forward targets, the total income of the commune will reach more than 4.79 million yuan. After deducting agricultural tax, public accumulation and various expenses, the grain and cash distributed to the members will be significantly increased compared to last year. According to the principle of distribution according to work and more pay for more work, some production teams with better production, such as the four villages of the original Jianming Cooperative, can increase the average income per person from 170 yuan last year to more than 200 yuan. The average income per person in the entire commune can be increased by about 40% compared to last year. After vigorously implementing the principle of unified leadership and hierarchical management, now, the commune's leap forward plan has been implemented to the ground, the responsibilities have been assigned to people, and the implementation has been carried out at all levels. All the members are continuing to adhere to the Party's policy of diligently and frugally running the commune with soaring enthusiasm, and striving to complete various production tasks ahead of schedule and overfulfill them to welcome the great 10th anniversary of the National Day.

Finally, I would also like to say something about my resentment towards the Indian expansionist elements. These guys support the Tibetan rebel group and interfere in our country's internal affairs, which is to destroy the friendship between the Chinese and Indian peoples, which is really unbearable. In order to safeguard our country's sovereignty and to uphold the friendship between the Chinese and Indian peoples, I want to warn these bad guys: your shameful conspiracy will definitely be crushed.

### 永远勤俭　永远向前  王国藩代表谈建明人民公社继续保持和发扬勤俭办社光荣传统

专栏：

    永远勤俭　永远向前
    王国藩代表谈建明人民公社继续保持和发扬勤俭办社光荣传统主席、各位代表：
    我是过去被人称为“穷棒子社”的王国藩。今天我想谈谈的就是原先的一帮“穷棒子”怎样在党的领导下，自力更生、靠自己的双手艰苦奋斗，从三条驴腿发展到今天拖拉机遍地跑；从原先每年靠政府支援二百多万斤粮食，一九五八年变成卖给国家四百万斤粮食的情况；也就是坚持执行党的勤俭办社方针的一些情况，向大会汇报一下，请大家批评指导。若说过去穷，那可一点也不假。我们西四十里铺在遵化县东边，是个长城脚下的山村，百分之九十的土地是在山腰上挂着的坡地和梯田。过去一亩地一年只能打六、七十斤粮食，全村百分之九十以上的户都缺吃少穿。一九五二年最初参加合作社的二十三户，以往不是扛活的就是讨饭的。所以当合作社刚建成的时候，我们只有土改时分得的二百三十亩地和四分之一到三分之一的若干个驴股凑起来的三条驴腿，其他在生产上所需要的东西就什么也没有了。看到了我们这种光景，富裕中农就说了些不中听的话，给我们叫“穷棒子社”，在生产上也蹩着劲要和我们比，甚至有的说我们没有上天摘星星的本事，就甭想赶上他们。这些事情，全体社员都看在眼里，记在心上。当时全社共有十九个男社员，都坚决地说：只要立下凌云志，定能摘下星星来！凭我们这三十八只手，一定要在生产上超过他们。就这样，我们有了雄心，也就有了克服困难的勇气和办法。没有牲口和农具，我们就上山打柴来换；有的社员没有粮食吃了，就互相通融；都没有粮食吃了，就抽出几个人去割草换粮食，草贱、人多，换来的粮食少，就让社员们先匀着吃。在这样严重的困难面前，少数社员有时也表现一点动摇，主张向国家贷款，或要求救济。但是这些意见，经过社员讨论，大家说：我们的国家这么大，都靠救济和贷款那还怎样进行建设呢？我们就下决心咬牙闯过这一关。
    生产有了发展　还要注意节约
    苦干一年，我们的农业产量加了一番，平均粮食亩产达到了一百七十四斤，比富裕中农最高的单位面积产量还高二十一斤。通过打柴、割草，换来了一辆铁轮车、一头牛、两头骡子、三十只羊和一部分零碎农具。事实证明，苦干就能创造财富。这也正如毛主席教导我们的“只要这些人掌握了自己的命运，又有一条马克思列宁主义的路线，不是回避问题，而是用积极的态度去解决问题，任何人间的困难总是可以解决的。”
    人的脑筋总是跟着条件的变化不断变化的。比方建社的头一年丰收了，有的社员认为这回可打下了个好底子，明年生产有本钱啦！也有的社员说：“饿着肚子跟中农们比了一年生产，现在该和他们比比生活了！”面对着这两条不同的路，到底应该走那条，我们发动社员进行了讨论。在讨论的过程中，社员们打了个有趣的比方：生产好比是“?子”，积蓄好比是“匣子”，浪费花钱好比是“杈子”，“?子”搂了来，“匣子”积起来，同时可以用手拿来；“?子”搂了来，“杈子”挑出去，到用时却没有了。通过这一番讨论，社员们弄清了要从经济上翻身，就得苦干，更要节约；只有不断地发展生产，生活才能改善。
    解决了生产生活的关系问题以后，社里还经常强调勤俭要从大处着眼，从小处着手。一九五四年秋收时，我们跟社员们算了一笔账：全社有三百亩花生，如果一撮撮丢一个果，就要丢五千一百斤。男社员说：保证刨花生时撮撮“三面见镐”，女社员们表示“要从精打细收里扒拉出一辆胶轮车来！”果然，这年秋季到冬初，通过精打细收，砍柴割草……，我们没有向国家借一个钱，就又添置了两头大骡子，两辆胶轮车。
    为了杜绝各种不应有的开支，我们曾学习了耿长锁同志社里的财务包干制，把农具修理费包到队里去。有的中农社员说：“一个队种二百多亩地，轮子、犁杖、盖等，一年只给三十元的修理费够干啥的？如果就给这么点钱那社里就得给买新的！”这种思想受到大家的反对。社员们说：“咱们的家具入社前能用，现在还能用，用不着买新的。社里的财产好像一坑水，是一点一滴集成的，不能浪费一分钱，只要现在能使就不买新的。”
    不能满足现状　还要继续苦干
    随着收入的增加，生活的逐步富裕，有些人就开始满足现状，东溜西晃，不积极参加社内劳动了。一九五七年春，有几个小青年常常旷工，队长让他们上班，他们就说：我不上班我少分红，咱现在仓库里有粮，银行有款，一个月不干活也挨不了蹩。支部研究了这种情况，让我去找他们座谈。我问他们现在的生活怎样，他们都说比过去好多了，我又问：“为什么现在的生活能好起来？”他们说：“是劳动创造的！”我说：“你们的爷爷和爸爸过去劳动怎样？”他们都争着说自己的老人劳动的好。我说：“这就怪了，老人们给地主富农扛活，一年作三百六十多个劳动日，干了一辈子也没创造出好生活，为什么我们在几年的功夫就能创造了好生活哩？”小伙子们楞了，后来说：“现在有共产党领导，走了合作化的道路，今后一定要把社办好，积极劳动，增产粮食和工业原料支持国家的工业建设。”
    疮好了不能忘痛　翻身了不能忘本
    满足现状的思想问题解决了，又发现了个别的社员有忘本的倾向。例如社员高进泉要过十几年饭，一九五三年冬入社以后，全家六个劳动力，除吃粮食外，每年收入现款四百元以上。到一九五七年，就盖了五正三厢的新房，买了两辆自行车。全家十二口人，除三个小孩以外，下余的每人都有两套新被褥。靠自己的双手由穷变富，这本是件光彩事，可是曾经有一段时间他一听别人提到过去就不高兴，认为说过去穷太丢人啦等等。经过教育，他已经改变了过去的看法，劳动的劲头更大了。这个事实说明，思想教育工作还必须加强。公社化以后，公社党委总结了我们过去勤俭办社由穷变富的事迹，在社员中广泛地进行了宣传，还把这些材料，布置了一个“建明公社史馆”（初级社刚成立时二十三户的那头“三条驴腿”的驴将来死了也要放到史馆里去）。让社员们见物动心，通过回忆过去，提高阶级觉悟，更加积极地执行勤俭办社和勤俭持家的原则。
    几年来，全体社员一面增加生产，一面省吃俭用，向社投资六万多元，向银行存款三万多元，支持了生产建设。
    在坚持勤俭办社的全部过程中，我们时刻记着党的教导：和群众打成一片“遇事和群众商量，吃苦在前，享受在后。干部们都是带头生产，和社员一样，凭劳动记工分红。这种作法对社员的影响很大，使社员们知道干部是为了大伙，不是为自己。虽然领导上和各地各界的同志们经常给我们很大的关怀和鼓励，我们清醒地知道：我们的成绩还很不够，绝对不能自满，还得继续向全国的兄弟社学习。我们曾学习了昌黎“后两山社”管理果树、安国的耕作园田化、山东石门宋乡养猪等先进经验。我们永远不会忘记毛主席的话：“虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后。”一不虚心，也就坚持不了勤俭办社的原则了。
    各位代表！如果说我们在坚持勤俭办社上有成绩，那就是巩固了社，发展了生产，改善了生活。到一九五八年公社化运动前夕，我们已经积累了价值四十七万多元的公共财产，主要的是：羊一千只，牛一百五十七头，骡子十二头，马四匹，胶轮大车十一辆，铁轮车十九辆，二十五匹马力的拖拉机一台，五瓩的发电机一部，培养起了四千多亩松山、八百亩河滩林和各种果树五万七千多棵，其中有两万七千多棵已经开始结果了。另外还打了水井十八眼，开了六条渠道，使两千多亩旱地变成水浇地。可以说，我们已经从经济上翻了身。
    完成人民公社化　人多力大能胜天
    一九五八年，党中央提出了“鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线”，给了社员们极大的鼓舞。个个争先恐后，战胜了几十年来未有的大旱灾和百年不遇的暴风雨，夺得了空前的大丰收。原来建明合作社四个村，粮食平均亩产七百斤，比一九五二年时平均亩产七十多斤增加九倍，达到每人占有一千斤。棉花平均亩产皮棉六十斤，再加林、牧、果树和家庭副业的收入，平均每人收入达一百七十元。社员们盖了六百多间新房，买了一百三十多辆自行车、十三架缝纫机，无衣无被、缺衣少被的现象不见了。现在是：村村通电话，户户听广播，并有四个村点上了电灯。
    从大跃进的实践中，社员们一方面认识到生产潜力是无穷的，但同时也看到：虽然披星戴月，付出了极大的努力，保证了丰收，可是毕竟还遭受了一定的损失，庄稼受了干旱的一定挫折，土地被山洪冲毁了一百多亩。如果要在山沟里建起水库把山洪控制起来，让它为山地水利化服务，产量还会有更大的增加。但是，要做到这一点，光凭一个高级社的力量办不到。事实使我们深刻地感到三、五个村的高级社，已经不能适应继续发展生产的需要了。因此，我们就商量搞人民公社。社员们对搞公社个个欢天喜地，热烈拥护。我们的建明社就和当地三十二个高级社合成建明人民公社。人民公社建成，就显示了极大的优越性。在公社的统一领导下，社员们划分战线，分头突击，按时完成了开矿、炼铁、炼钢、秋收、深翻种麦八千亩等繁重任务。开办了工厂、作坊47个，还建成一座能容二百七十万立方水、可浇一万多亩土地的水库。创造了史无前例的奇迹。在这个时刻，却又有部分的干部和社员认为：公社化了，不论从人力、物力、财力方面说，都比高级社雄厚多了，生产上又获得了大丰收，花钱可以大方些。不少的生产队，缺什么东西自己能解决的也伸手向公社要。沙岭子是一个山村，本来使驴很方便，可是干部主张把毛驴卖掉换骡马。铺张思想又有抬头。
    建成社会主义　必须坚持勤俭办社
    针对上述情况，公社党委用回忆、对比的方法，进行了社会主义和共产主义教育。使他们一致认识到，我们现在的社会主义建设，只是幸福生活的开始，要建成社会主义，进入共产主义时代的美好生活，还得继续保持和发扬党所教导我们的勤俭办社的光荣传统，不花钱要办事，少花钱多办事。公社运输力不足，社员们说：“过去我们向山上要过牲口、大车，今天我们要向山上要汽车！”仅七天的时间，就打柴一百七十八万多斤，价值三万五千六百多元，可以买到两辆大汽车。为争取一九五九年的更大跃进，公社削减了非生产开支，使资金集中到生产上来，社购买了五部拖拉机、七台锅驼机，和两部十瓩的水轮发电机，向农业的机械化、电气化，迈出了第一步。发挥公社优越性　今年继续大跃进在这次会议上，听了周总理、李富春、李先念副总理和彭真副委员长所作的报告，使我们更加信心百倍，要在去年大跃进的基础上，争取今年再来一个大跃进。我们要充分发挥人民公社的优越条件，根据工农业并举的方针，有计划地建立修配厂、农具厂、农药厂、土化肥厂等十七种小工厂和作坊，全年生产总值可达四十六万多元；生产土化肥、农药、农具等十七种产品，支持农业生产；全面贯彻农业八字宪法，将全公社的粮食亩产量由去年的五百多斤，提高到千斤左右。同时将棉花的亩产量，提高到一百斤皮棉，花生提高到四百八十斤。我们还计划充分利用山区的自然条件，大力发展林木畜牧副业和渔业，争取农林牧副渔五业全面发展。我们除在荒山河滩种植林木四千多亩外，还准备栽种果树两千多亩，逐步实现大地园林化，梯田坡地桑果化，河边道旁林荫化。在畜牧业方面，我们除大力增加耕畜来支持农业生产外，还要运用集体喂养和个人喂养两条腿走路的办法，发展猪羊。把全社的猪羊数目，从现有的三万一千多只，迅速增加到七万八千只。同时还鼓励社员大量喂养鸡鸭蜂兔。打柴割草等副业生产，是我们原建明社白手起家的重要门路，今年公社除搞好工农业及其他各项生产外，仍然要抽出农闲时间，开展起打柴荆编等四十种副业生产，来增加社、队和社员的收入。另外，我们还打算用新修的水库，放养二十万尾鱼，开辟新的生产门路。实现了这些跃进指标，公社的总收入将达到四百七十九万多元。这笔收入，扣除了农业税、公共积累和各种开支，分配给社员的吃粮和现款，比去年会有显著的提高。根据按劳分配多劳多得的原则，有些生产较好的生产队，例如原来建明合作社四个村的每人平均收入，就可由去年的一百七十元增加到二百元以上。全公社的每人平均收入，大约可比去年增加百分之四十左右。经过大力贯彻统一领导分级管理的原则，现在，公社的跃进规划已经措施到地，责任到人，层层落实。全体社员正以冲天的干劲，继续坚持党的勤俭办社方针，力争提前超额完成各项生产任务，迎接伟大的国庆十周年。
    最后，我还想说一下我对于印度扩张主义分子的愤恨。这些家伙支持西藏叛乱集团、干涉我国内政，也就是破坏中印两国人民的友谊，实在令人难忍。为了维护我们国家的主权，为了坚持中印人民的友谊，我要警告这些坏家伙：你们的可耻的阴谋，一定会被粉碎。
