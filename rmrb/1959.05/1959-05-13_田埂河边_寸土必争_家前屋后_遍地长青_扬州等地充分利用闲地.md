Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, 11th - The broad masses in the Yangzhou Special District of Jiangsu Province are actively utilizing vacant land to plant vegetables, melons, eggplants, water chestnuts, lotus roots, oil crops, and other crops. The entire district has formed a mass planting movement of "around homes and houses, fields and riverbanks, planting everywhere, everywhere green." Currently, over 490,000 mu of vacant land in the district has been planted.

    To cultivate vacant land well, various localities have established specialized institutions. The Taizhou County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party established a headquarters specifically responsible for this work. Each commune, brigade, and production team also assigned specific personnel to be responsible for formulating plans, organizing labor, and raising seeds. The Sanhe Brigade of the Daiyao People's Commune in Xinghua County also studied the problem of crop rotation. The team plans to plant melons on 136 mu of vegetable and feed land. In the summer, the melon vines will be removed and autumn cabbage and radishes will be planted. After the radishes are harvested, spring cabbage can be planted. In addition, planting hyacinth beans, climbing gourds, loofah, and cowpeas along riverbanks, field ridges, beside trees, and around homes, plus planting lotus roots and water chestnuts in ponds, and intercropping radishes in cotton fields, will allow commune members to eat vegetables all year round.

    Various localities have also established responsibility systems and income distribution plans, implementing a system where collective lands are cultivated and harvested by the teams, and individual commune members cultivate and harvest scattered lands. Commune members are actively raising seeds and seizing the time to plant melons and beans.

Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin - Changli County, Hebei Province, is utilizing scattered land to massively plant oil crops, melons, vegetables, and other cash crops.

    Since completing the sowing of large fields at the end of April, the county began to use vacant land to increase the planting of oil crops, melons, vegetable crops, etc. An average of more than 100,000 rural commune members and urban residents are using their early morning and evening rest time to plant sunflowers, castor beans, corn, soybeans, melons, etc., along pits and canal banks. Up to now, the county has cultivated more than 30,000 mu of idle land.

    Before launching the movement to utilize vacant land, the Changli County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party held a special telephone conference to make arrangements, and determined the principle that large areas of vacant land or reclaimed land should be managed by the brigade, small pieces of scattered vacant land should be managed by the team, and the edges of villages and around houses should be planted by individual commune members, who would receive the income.

Our Newspaper - The Zhoukoudian District of Beijing now has more than 3,400 people every day planting various crops on all usable vacant and scattered land to increase the spring sowing area.

    The Ma'an People's Commune decided to launch a ten-day major assault to plant all 1,200 mu of vacant land with crops. The commune stipulated that on the premise of ensuring the completion of the national planting plan, small teams would plant and harvest. Commune members would plant and harvest small vacant lots such as next to houses and in courtyards. Commune members are in high spirits and full of energy. In three days, they planted 336 mu of scattered land with crops such as soybeans, melons, and vegetables.

    田埂河边  寸土必争  家前屋后  遍地长青
    扬州等地充分利用闲地
    新华社南京11日电  江苏省扬州专区广大群众积极利用空隙地种植蔬菜、瓜、茄、菱、藕、油料等作物，全区形成一个“家前屋后，田埂河边，无处不种，遍地常青”的群众性种植运动。现在，全区已被种植的空闲地有四十九万多亩。
    为了种好空闲地，各地都建立了专门机构。中共泰州县委成立了指挥部，专门负责这项工作。各公社、大队、生产队也分配专人负责制订规划、组织力量、筹集种子等工作。兴化县戴窑人民公社三合大队还研究了种植作物的茬口搭配问题。该队计划在一百三十六亩菜地和饲料地栽瓜，夏天把瓜藤拉掉再栽秋青菜和萝卜，萝卜挖掉又可以种春青菜。此外，在河畔、田埂、树旁和家前屋后种扁豆、爬墙瓜、丝瓜、豇豆，加上水塘栽藕、种菱、棉花田夹种萝卜，这样，社员一年四季都可以吃到蔬菜。
    各地还建立了责任制度和收益分配方案，实行成片空地队种队收，零星土地社员谁种谁收。社员们都积极筹集种子，抓时间栽瓜点豆。
    据新华社天津电  河北昌黎县利用零散土地大量种植油料、瓜菜等经济作物。
    这个县自4月底完成了大田播种任务后，就开始利用空闲地增种油料、瓜菜作物等，平均每天有十万多农村社员和城镇居民利用早晚休息的时间，分别到坑、渠道边种植向日葵、蓖麻、玉米、大豆、瓜类等。截至现在，全县已耕种闲散地三万多亩。
    在开展利用空闲地运动前，中共昌黎县委曾专门召开电话会议进行布置，并且确定了大片空闲地或开荒由大队经营，小片零散闲地由小队经营，村边房前房后，发动社员个人种植，以及谁种谁得收益的原则。
    本报讯  北京市周口店区各人民公社，现在每天有三千四百多人，在一切可以利用的闲地、散地上种植各种作物，以增加春播面积。
    马安人民公社决定开展十天大突击，将一千二百亩闲地全部种上庄稼。这个公社规定，在保证完成国家种植计划的前提下，小队种小队收；宅旁、院内等小块空地，社员自种自收。社员们情绪很高，干劲十足，在三天内，就将三百三十六亩零散土地种上了大豆、瓜、菜等作物。
    现在，这个区每天有三千四百多人大搞利用闲地的种植活动，几天来已取得很大成绩，据不完全统计，到8日已利用起闲、散空地，种植瓜、菜、玉米、豆类等五千三百五十七亩。
