Introducing a Good Play to Children
    Bing Xin
    To celebrate International Children's Day, children, you must be planning the most interesting and meaningful activities for yourselves, right? Here, I'd like to introduce you to a program that can be performed at evening parties: the large-scale children's drama "A Revolutionary Family" (published in the May issue of the "Drama Script Monthly"). This play is a collective adaptation of Comrade Tao Cheng's "My Family" by the China Children's Art Theatre, written by Comrades Luo Ying and Zhao Hongru.
    The script dramatically portrays the heroic actions of Comrade Tao Cheng's family in their struggle against the enemy. The play begins by immediately plunging the audience into the counter-revolutionary gunshots of 1927 after Chiang Kai-shek betrayed the revolution. Following this, the Yang Xin (i.e., Ouyang Meisheng) family embarks on a difficult and tortuous struggle against the enemy. Through that struggle, we are clearly made to feel that although the enemy was strong and we were weak at the time, the revolutionary forces were advancing wave upon wave, becoming stronger and more resilient with each fight!
    The script creates the image of the young hero Yang Zhixiong (i.e., Li'an), allowing us to see his communist spirit and character in concrete terms. For example, Zhixiong had a very stubborn personality when he was young, but once, when he failed his arithmetic test, his father reprimanded him, and his stubbornness was expressed in his willingness to accept criticism and correct his mistakes. Soon after, under the persecution of the White Terror, the Party and his father temporarily left them, and the whole family was left helpless. But we saw that Zhixiong did not complain or shed a tear, but resolutely went to the dock to work as a coolie, helping his mother bear the burden of life. It was during this period that he buried a deep hatred for the enemy. Later, when he returned to the embrace of the Party and his father, he used fiery enthusiasm to demand revolutionary work, so he became a small messenger. It seemed that nothing could make Zhixiong more energetic and high-spirited than working for the revolution. We can often feel the sparks of alertness and wisdom flashing in his mind. Once, when he was working as a small messenger, the Party organization was holding a meeting in his home, but the warden pushed a new bicycle in. Immediately, he decided that the warden must love his bicycle very much, so he deliberately went to play with the bicycle, which finally made the warden hurry to push the bicycle away. When he was the Minister of the Youth Workers Department in Shanghai, he had already grown from a Communist Youth League member to a Communist Party member. Once, the Kuomintang police were about to search a worker, and the worker was carrying a leaflet that Zhixiong had just given him, so Zhixiong immediately disguised himself as an enemy and not only protected the worker but also gave the police a good scolding. This made us feel even more strongly the spirit of making himself a docile tool of the Party, which permeated every action he took. Finally, when he was arrested and imprisoned, and on the verge of execution, although the original work did not provide a direct description here, the script created an exciting scene for us. We cannot forget how Zhixiong firmly countered the Kuomintang party hack—the "Mao Tou Ying" (owl), who was trying to persuade him to surrender; nor can we forget how Zhixiong comforted his friends and encouraged his mother with optimism, even though he was about to go to the execution ground. In our ears, we still hear him reciting "The Stormy Petrel" loudly, saying: My dearest Party! I will always be your most loyal son!
    In terms of artistic treatment, this play is also very easy for children to understand. It expresses a relatively rich ideological content, but there are no long, dull dialogues, but rather it is expressed through the vivid actions of the characters; it has a tortuous story, but the dramatic entanglements and clues of each scene are very simple and clear.

    给小朋友介绍一出好戏
    兵辛
    为了庆祝“六一”儿童节，小朋友们，你们一定正在为自己安排最有趣和最有意义的活动吧？这里，我给你们介绍一个可以作晚会演出的节目，那就是大型儿童剧“革命的一家”（发表在剧本月刊五月号上）。这个戏，是中国儿童剧院根据陶承同志的“我的一家”集体改编，由罗英、赵鸿儒两同志执笔写的。
    剧本富有戏剧性地表现了陶承同志一家对敌斗争的英勇行为。戏一开始，马上就把人带进1927年蒋介石背叛革命后的反革命枪声中去。跟着，杨辛（即欧阳梅生）一家就与敌人展开了艰苦而又曲折的斗争。在那斗争中，使我们很鲜明地感到，虽然当时的情况是敌强我弱，可是革命的力量却是前仆后继，越斗越坚强，越斗越壮大了！
    剧本塑造了青年英雄杨志雄
  （即立安）的形象，使我们具体地看到他的共产主义的精神品质。例如，志雄小时候性格非常倔强，可是有一次他的算术没考及格，父亲责备了他，他的倔强也表现在勇于接受批评，勇于改正错误上。不久，在白色恐怖的迫害下，党和父亲都暂时离开了他们，全家生活陷于无助的地步，但是我们看到志雄没叫一声苦，没掉一滴眼泪，毅然走到码头上去当小苦力，帮助母亲担起了生活的重担。就在这段生活里，他对敌人埋下了刻骨的仇恨。后来，当他又回到党和父亲的怀抱中，他就用火样的热情要求革命工作，于是他当上了小交通员。看起来，再没有比能为革命工作更使志雄朝气蓬勃，意气风发的了。我们能常常感觉到他思想里闪烁着机警与才智的火花。就在他作小交通员的时候，有一次党组织在他家里开会，保长却推着新自行车闯来，于是他马上断定了保长一定很爱他的车子，就故意去玩那辆车子，终于使保长赶快推车走掉了。他在上海作青工部部长的时候，那时他早已由共青团员成长为共产党员了。有一次，国民党警察要搜查一个工人，而这个工人身上正放着志雄刚才交给他的传单，于是志雄马上伪装成敌人，不但掩护了工人，而且把警察好好训了一顿。这使我们更突出地感觉到，渗透在他每一个行动里的那种把自己作为党的驯服工具的精神。最后，当他被捕入狱、临刑前的时刻，虽然原著在这里没有作正面的描写，可是剧本却为我们创造了激动人心的场面。我们不能忘记志雄是怎样坚定地反击着劝他投降的国民党党棍——毛头鹰；也不能忘记志雄是怎样充满着乐观主义的精神劝慰朋友，鼓励母亲，虽然他自己就要走向刑场，在我们的耳边，还久久地响着他高声朗诵“海燕”的声音，说着这样的话：我最亲爱的党！我永远是你最忠诚的儿子！
    这个戏在艺术处理上，也是很容易为小朋友们看得懂的。它表现了比较丰富的思想内容，但是并没有大段沉闷的对话，而是通过人物的鲜明动作表现出来的；它有曲折的故事，但每一场的戏剧纠葛、线索却很单纯明快。
