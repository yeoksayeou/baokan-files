Li Shunda and Shen Jilan

Everyone knows that there are Li Shunda and Shen Jilan in the Taihang Mountains. They are both from the Xigou Jinxing People's Commune in Huguan County (formerly Pingshun County). In the old society, this place lacked gold, wood, water, fire, and earth, so the masses lived in great suffering, with little to eat and wear. Now this mountain village has become a beautiful fruit mountain in the Taihang Mountains, not only with telephones and electric lights but also accessible by automobiles.

In the Great Leap Forward of 1958, Li Shunda and Shen Jilan led the people of the Xigou Management District through hard work and ingenuity, increasing grain production from 461 jin per mu in 1957 to 803 jin, increasing the income of all commune members and improving their lives.

In 1959, they were even more motivated and determined. In addition to actively implementing the Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture and completing this task, they will also lead the masses by example in doing the following five things to transform the five lacks of Xigou Village into five haves!

One, "Gold." After exploration, Xigou has a large amount of iron ore (about seven million tons). This year, the masses will be organized to vigorously mine it, both to support industrial construction and to develop production and increase the income of commune members.

Two, "Wood." This year, Xigou will achieve 30,000 mu of forest slopes, 50,000 fruit trees, and 1 million walnut trees, realizing the plan of ten thousand mu of forest and a thousand mu of orchard.

Three, "Water." Last year, they put forward the slogan "Great Battle of Baili Beach, Turn Xigou into Jiangnan." After a hundred days of hard work, they built more than 100 large and small reservoirs, more than 5,200 valley weirs (water storage ponds), 51 flood barriers, and more than 5,600 large and small canals, and also dug more than 1,900 drought wells. This year, we will continue to realize this slogan.

Four, "Fire." In the past, the masses here could not burn coal at all, and relied entirely on firewood for cooking and heating all year round. Now that coal mines have been found, mining must be guaranteed this year.

Five, "Earth." The soil in this village is thin and rocky. After the cooperativization, people carried soil to create land and built terraced fields. This year, all of them will be terraced. And through closing hillsides for afforestation, digging fish-scale pits, building valley weirs, and building reservoirs, soil erosion is basically controlled.

Xu Shunhai and Zhang Xiaobao

Comrades: Do you still remember Xu Shunhai and Zhang Xiaobao, the militia heroes who were famous in the Taihang Mountains during the Anti-Japanese War for killing the enemy?

On the first day of the Spring Festival this year, at more than three o'clock in the middle of the night, snowflakes were flying, the northwest wind was bitterly cold, and people were still sound asleep. In Changxing Village, Huguan County, several people carrying manure baskets and holding iron shovels vaguely appeared on the street. The township notified that there would be a three-day holiday for the Spring Festival. Who got up so early to deliver manure? It was none other than Xu Shunhai, the militia hero who was famous for defending the cave dwellings in the Taihang Mountains during the Anti-Japanese War and today's armed forces minister of the commune, and Zhang Xiaobao, the secretary of the Party branch of the management district.

Changxing Village is located in the rocky mountains in the southeastern part of the Taihang Mountains, where the land is barren. During the Anti-Japanese War, each mu of land yielded an average of only seventy or eighty jin of grain. After liberation, production gradually increased. During the Great Leap Forward in 1958, each mu yielded an average of more than 230 jin of grain. This year, this heroic village will strive to "cross the Yellow River" and achieve an average yield of 500 jin of grain per mu. For this reason, Xu Shunhai and Zhang Xiaobao, with the tenacious spirit of defending the cave dwellings in those years, led the masses to fight against nature.

Old Worker Shi Chengyu

Old worker Shi Chengyu, he was a hero of the Huangyandong Arsenal back then. During the Anti-Japanese War, in order to strike at the enemy, he worked hard day and night, developing and manufacturing a large number of military products such as landmines, grenades, smoke bombs, and rolling mines. Because of his contributions, he was twice named a model worker and attended the group hero meeting in the Jin-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region. Now this arsenal is no longer in the Huangyandong, a cliffside location from those years, but has been established in Changzhi City, the capital of the Jin Southeast Special District in the Taihang Mountains. Its name is Huifeng Machinery Factory, and it is manufacturing new products for the development of industrial and agricultural production. Shi Chengyu is now a technician in this factory.

Although Comrade Shi Chengyu is fifty-three years old, he has not lost the heroic spirit of those years, and is still advancing vigorously in the torrent of the Great Leap Forward like a young man. In 1958, he overfulfilled the annual production plan and won the title of advanced producer for the whole year. In 1959, he was even more motivated and proposed that he would share weal and woe with the workers, guarantee that there would be no defective products in 1959, and complete and overfulfill the plan on time, in quality, and in quantity every quarter.

    老英雄雄心不减当年
    李顺达和申纪兰
    人人都知道太行山上有个李顺达和申纪兰，他们都是壶关县（原平顺县）西沟金星人民公社人。在旧社会，这里因为金、木、水、火、土样样具缺，所以群众生活非常痛苦，少吃没穿。现在这个山庄变成了太行山上一个美丽的花果山，不仅通了电话，点上了电灯，而且通了汽车。
    李顺达和申纪兰在1958年的大跃进中，领导西沟管理区人民经过苦干和巧干，使粮食产量由1957年的亩产四百六十一斤猛增到八百零三斤，全体社员都增加了收入，改善了生活。
    在1959年他们的干劲更足，决心更大。除积极贯彻执行八字宪法，完成这个任务以外，他们俩还要以身作则，带领群众办好以下五件事，把西沟村的五缺变成五有！
    一、“金”。经过勘察，西沟有大量的铁矿石（约七百万吨）。今年要组织群众大力开采，一者可以支援工业建设，再者也能发展生产，增加社员收入。
    二、“木”。西沟今年要达到三万亩林坡，五万株水果树，一百万株核桃树，实现万亩林，千亩园的计划。
　　三、“水”。去年他们提出的口号是“大战百里滩，西沟变江南”。苦战了一百天，修起了一百多个大小水库，五千二百多座谷坊（蓄水池），五十一座拦洪坝，五千六百条大小水渠，还打了一千九百多眼旱井。今年要继续实现这一口号。
    四、“火”。过去这里群众根本烧不到煤，一年四季做饭、取暖全靠用柴。现在找到了煤矿，今年要保证开采出来。
    五、“土”。他们这个村石厚土薄，合作化后，经过人们担土造地，垒成了梯田，今年要全部实现地埂化。并经过封山育林，挖鱼鳞坑，建谷坊，修水库，基本上控制水土流失。
    徐顺孩和张小保
    同志们：你们还记得抗日战争时期名冠太行山的民兵杀敌英雄徐顺孩和张小保吗？
    今年春节初一，深夜三点多钟，天正在飘着雪片，西北风寒冷刺骨，人们都还在酣睡中，壶关县常行村，街上影影绰绰出现了几个挑粪筐拿铁锨的人。乡里通知，春节放假三天，是谁这么早就起来送粪呢？不是别人，正是太行山当年以窑洞保卫战出名的民兵英雄、今天的公社武装部长徐顺孩和管理区党支部书记张小保。
    常行村在太行山东南部的石山区，土地瘠薄，抗日战争时期，每亩土地平均只打七、八十斤粮食，解放后生产逐步提高，1958年大跃进，每亩平均产到二百三十多斤粮食。今年这个英雄的村庄要争取“过黄河”，平均亩产五百斤粮食。为了这，徐顺孩和张小保以当年窑洞保卫战的顽强精神，带领群众向自然界进行斗争。
    老工人石成玉
    老工人石成玉，他是当年黄烟洞兵工厂的英雄。在抗日战争中，为了打击敌人，他不分昼夜苦心钻研，制造出大批的地雷、手榴弹、烟幕弹、滚雷等军火产品。因为有功劳，他曾两次被评为模范，并出席晋冀鲁豫边区的群英大会。现在这个兵工厂不在当年悬崖绝壁的黄烟洞里了，已经建立在太行山晋东南专区的首府——长治市。它的名字叫惠丰机械厂，为发展工农业生产正在制造新的产品。石成玉现在是这个工厂的技师。
    石成玉同志虽然五十三岁了，但他并没有失去当年的英雄气概，还像青年小伙子一样，在大跃进的洪流里奋发前进。1958年他超额完成了全年生产计划，获得了全年先进生产者的称号。1959年他的干劲更足，自己提出：要和工人同甘共苦，保证1959年不出废品，季季按时、按质、按量，完成和超额完成计划。
