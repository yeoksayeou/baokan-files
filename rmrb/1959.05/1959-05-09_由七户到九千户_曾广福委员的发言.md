Committee Member Zeng Guangfu's Speech:

Chairman, fellow committee members:

I fully endorse Premier Zhou's Government Work Report and the reports of the leading comrades.

Our cooperative was a small cooperative formed by seven mutual aid teams in 1951, with only twenty-six people and ninety-six mu of land, which was mostly alkaline land and not very productive. During the high tide of cooperativization in 1956, it was formed into an advanced cooperative by forty-eight small cooperatives. In the autumn of 1958, the People's Commune was established. The entire commune has nine thousand households, thirty-seven thousand people, and one hundred and twenty thousand mu of cultivated land. Before and after the establishment of the commune in 1958, thanks to the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, and through the rectification campaign and the great voicing of views, big-character posters, and great debates, we achieved a great victory in the struggle between the two roads. The ideological awareness of the broad masses of commune members has been raised, greatly boosting their enthusiasm and fully unleashing their initiative in production under the brilliant illumination of the Party's General Line. In the Dong Duzhuang Management Area of the Cuodian People's Commune in Fan County, we have one thousand five hundred households and twenty-one thousand mu of land. Grain production in 1958 quadrupled compared to 1957. Cotton and oilseed crops also achieved bumper harvests. We overfulfilled the task of purchasing 500,000 jin of grain long ago. The great bumper harvest and great leap forward in agricultural production in 1958 were due to our firm adherence to the words of the Party and Chairman Mao, setting high aspirations, boosting morale, and implementing the "Eight-Point Charter" for agriculture. Here, I will briefly talk about the situation of our management area's great efforts in water conservancy and the unfolding of the great leap forward in the manure accumulation campaign.

In the past, it was very difficult to get drinking water in our area. There were very few wells. The twelve villages in the entire management area had only a dozen wells in total. The water source was also insufficient. During droughts, people had to line up to scoop water with spoons. Irrigation was even more out of the question. In addition, due to the drought last year, crops failed nine out of ten years. In the past, the masses had a saying: "Nine years out of ten are drought years, not a single grain is seen, only famine and begging." After cooperativization in 1956, the Party led us to start digging wells and engage in water conservancy. In the past few years, especially after the great leap forward in 1958, we have now dug more than six hundred wells, including more than twenty motorized wells, and excavated more than two hundred ditches (there were none in the past), as well as more than four hundred waterwheels and four pumping machines. All cultivated land has now been fully converted into garden-style fields and has water conservancy. Even the more than one thousand mu of land on the top of the Majia River embankment have been drilled with wells and equipped with pumping machines, which are watered in a timely manner. These are all things that people did not dare to imagine in the past. Thanks to water conservancy, we are not afraid of droughts or floods. For example, although it did not rain during the wheat planting season last year, it did not affect timely sowing at all. Last winter and this spring, the more than eight thousand mu of wheat in the entire management area were generally watered four times. If all the water conservancy facilities were used, more than two thousand mu of land could be watered in a single day. In the past, the wheat seedlings that grew well could be covered by crows only by Qingming Festival; this year's wheat is already more than a foot tall ten days before Qingming Festival. The commune members are all happily saying: "The reservoirs are full of water, and the granaries are full of grain, it's really double insurance!" Many people, thinking about the past and comparing it with the present, are even happier, and sing in a doggerel: "The old man is over eighty years old this year, the suffering of the old society is indescribable, nine years out of ten there is no harvest, nothing to eat and nothing to drink. For thousands of years, no one cared, Chairman Mao's leadership solved it, today we have realized water conservancy, and we are happy with plenty of food and clothing." Indeed, after water conservancy, no matter how big a drought or other disaster, it can't threaten us. The Party's words are correct: "Man is sure to conquer nature." Now the enthusiasm of the commune members is even greater.

In terms of manure accumulation, although the application of fertilizer to the land was much more than before (before cooperativization) before 1958, the average was only more than three thousand jin to four thousand jin per mu. During the great leap forward in 1958, in order to strive for the upstream and strive for a bumper harvest, the commune members proposed "not only to make the land drink enough, but also to make the land eat enough." Men, women, old and young, every household found ways to tap various potentials and made a big fuss about the manure accumulation campaign, resulting in more than eighty kinds of granular fertilizer, bacterial fertilizer, potassium green manure, artificial fertilizer, etc. For example, during the rush to accumulate fertilizer, the entire management area accumulated more than nine million jin of fertilizer in one day and one night, with an average of more than six thousand jin per household. As a result, the amount of fertilizer applied to the land has greatly increased, reaching 30,000 jin to 50,000 jin per mu, and the average standard fertilizer per mu has reached more than 20,000 jin. In order to accumulate more fertilizer, pig raising has been greatly developed. At present, the entire management area has more than four thousand pigs, with an average of three pigs per household, and plans to develop to eight thousand to ten thousand pigs this year.

The above achievements are due to the Party's General Line illuminating people's hearts, and are given to us by the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao. Because our management area has realized water conservancy after the great leap forward in 1958. With the experience of the great leap forward in 1958, striving for a bigger, better and more comprehensive leap forward in 1959 is even more guaranteed. In the future, we must resolutely listen to the Party's words, ensure that agricultural production is done well, and overfulfill the production tasks of grain, cotton, and oil crops in 1959.

### 由七户到九千户  曾广福委员的发言

　　由七户到九千户
    曾广福委员的发言主席、各位委员：
    我听了周总理的政府工作报告和各位首长的报告，完全拥护。
    我社在一九五一年是由七户互助组组成的一个小社，当时只有二十六人，九十六亩土地，还都是碱地不大长庄稼。在一九五六年合作化高潮的时候，又由四十八个小社组成一个高级社。一九五八年秋成立了人民公社。全社共有九千户、三万七千口人、十二万亩耕地。在一九五八年成立公社前后，由于党和毛主席的英明领导，经过了整风和大鸣、大放、大字报、大辩论，取得了两条道路斗争的伟大胜利。广大社员群众思想觉悟都提高了，在党的总路线的光辉照耀下，大大鼓足了干劲，充分发挥了生产积极性。我们范县徂店人民公社董杜庄管理区有一千五百户、土地二万一千亩。粮食产量一九五八年比一九五七年就翻了两番。棉花、油料作物都得到了大丰收。五十万斤的统购粮早就超额完成了任务。一九五八年农业生产上的大丰收大跃进，是由于我们坚决听了党和毛主席的话，立大志、鼓干劲，贯彻了农业“八字宪法”才得来的。在这里简单说说我们管理区大搞水利化和开展积肥运动大跃进的情形。
    过去在我们那里吃水都是很困难的。水井很少。全管理区的十二个村共计才有十多眼井。水源还不足。天旱了打水都得排队用勺子淘。浇地灌溉就更谈不到了，加上去年旱灾，庄稼十年九不收。过去群众有句话是：“十年九年旱，颗粒都不见，只有逃荒和要饭”。一九五六年合作化以后，党领导我们开始打井搞水利。几年来，特别是经过一九五八年的大跃进，现在共打井六百多眼其中机井二十多眼了，开挖沟渠二百多条（过去一条也没有），还有四百多部水车，四部抽水机。所有耕地已全部达到园田化、水利化了。就连马夹河堤顶上的一千多亩地也都打了井，安了抽水机，适时浇上水了。这都是过去想都不敢想的事。由于水利化，旱灾涝灾都不怕了。如去年种麦季节虽没有下雨，根本就没影响适时播种。去冬今春全管理区八千多亩麦子普遍上了四遍水。要把所有水利都用起来，一晌就能浇二千多亩地。以前麦苗长得好的到清明才能埋住老鸹；今年的麦子离清明还有十天，都长的一尺多高了。社员都高兴地说；“水满库，粮满仓，真是双保险哩！”许多群众想想过去，比比现在，更是高兴，用顺口溜唱：“老汉今年八十多，旧社会的苦难没法说，十年九旱不收成，没啥吃来没啥喝。几千年来都无人管，毛主席领导才解决，今天实现了水利化，丰衣足食乐哈哈。”确实在水利化以后，不管有多大的旱灾或其他什么灾害都威胁不住我们了。党说的话对：“人定能胜天”。现在社员的干劲更大了。
    在积肥方面，一九五八年以前虽然土地施肥比从前（合作化前）增加很多，每亩平均也不过三千多斤到四千斤。一九五八年大跃进中，为了力争上游，争取大丰收，社员们提出“不光叫地喝足，还要叫地吃足”。男女老少、家家户户都找窍门，发挥了多种潜力，大闹积肥运动，搞的有颗粒肥、细菌肥、钾绿肥、人造肥等共八十多种。如在突击积肥的时候，一天一夜的时间全管理区就积肥九百多万斤，每户平均六千斤以上。这样一来地里的施肥量大大增加，一亩地上到三万斤、五万斤，平均每亩地的标准肥达到二万斤以上。为了多积肥，大大发展了养猪。现在全管理区共养猪四千多头，平均每户有三头猪，计划在今年还要发展到八千头到一万头。
    以上这些成绩是由于党的总路线照亮了人们的心，是党和毛主席的领导给我们的。由于我们管理区经过一九五八年大跃进实现了水利化。有了一九五八年大跃进的经验，争取一九五九年更大更好更全面的跃进，更加有了保证，今后我们要坚决听党的话，保证搞好农业生产和超额完成一九五九年的粮、棉、油料等生产任务。
