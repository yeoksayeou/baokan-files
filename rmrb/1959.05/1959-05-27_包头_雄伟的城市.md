    Baotou – A Magnificent City
    Tian Lin

    Before visiting Baotou, although I knew from newspapers that Baotou's construction scale was large, I couldn't imagine it would be so big and so magnificent.

    Baotou City is located at the foot of the Daqing Mountains in the eastern part of the Yin Mountains. The urban area alone stretches for sixty to seventy *li* from east to west. The towering Daqing Mountains are naturally very majestic, but now they seem somewhat dwarfed. The No. 1 blast furnace of Baotou Iron and Steel Company, with its outer shell just completed, the hot blast stove and water tower of the No. 1 blast furnace system, and the chimneys of the coking plant already in production, all resemble towering peaks soaring into the clouds. When I went to the No. 1 blast furnace, which looked like a skyscraper, I couldn't help but exclaim in surprise: Ah, I have never seen such a high and large blast furnace! The person in charge of the construction site told me that the volume of this blast furnace reached 1,513 cubic meters. He said that in China, only the No. 10 blast furnace built by Anshan Iron and Steel Company in the fourth quarter of last year can compare with it.

    Upon arriving in Baotou, I had a very fresh feeling. Baotou's new urban area—the main body of Baotou City—is brand new, without any traces of the old era's dilapidated, cramped, and confined features. Newly built wide roads, newly built neat and beautiful factories, workers' dormitories, department stores, cinemas, and schools, newly planted tender green street trees, new-style machinery and equipment in the factories... The vitality of youth overflows in every construction site and production workshop. In order to strive for Baogang's early iron, steel, and steel production, tens of thousands of employees in Baotou City have launched a lively red flag competition since this year, making new records of technological innovation and production construction emerge continuously. Since January, Baotou City employees have proposed more than 100,000 technological innovation projects, of which more than 10,000 have been realized. These have demonstrated great power in accelerating the construction progress of Baogang, ensuring the quality of projects and products, and saving manpower and material resources. For example, such a story happened on the construction site of Baogang's No. 1 blast furnace: A photographer went to take construction photos. When he went there on the first day, he saw that the scrubbing tower had just been made at the base. He didn't take the picture. When he went there on the third day, the scrubbing tower had been completely made and dressed up, standing in front of him. As a result, he had to find another subject. The Baotou Machinery Factory did not have large equipment and had never made large machines in the past. But this year, they boldly accepted the task of making ball mills. The large ring gear of this ball mill has a diameter of more than three meters. What should be used to process it? The workers thought of many ways and finally created two small machines called "snake swallowing an elephant" and "little monkey riding an elephant" to make the large ring gear. The Baotou Automobile Repair Factory could not repair large trucks in the past due to the lack of accessories, but the employees adopted the method of restoring old parts, solved the supply problem of 2,700 accessories, and repaired all the heavy-duty vehicles of Baogang that needed repair and put them into the transportation fleet in April.

    Old Baotou, from more than two hundred years ago, when a Tibetan lama traveling along the Yin Mountains built the first thatched house here, to before liberation, although the population was also tens of thousands, it was merely a gathering and distribution place for frontier fur and grain, with no industry at all, and even handicrafts were scarce.

    The Yellow River basin is the birthplace and breeding ground of our ancestors and Chinese culture, and also the area where the Mongols later nomadic. It is conceivable that it was by no means a barren place in ancient times. Even the name "Baotou" indicates that Baotou was originally rich in water and grass (according to the original Mongolian word for Baotou, which means a place with deer). Due to past ethnic wars and later reactionary rule, many places in the middle and upper reaches of the Yellow River in Baotou have become very desolate. The middle and upper reaches of the Yellow River used to be a battleground between the Xiongnu and the Han people. The "Shanyu's hunting fire illuminates Wolf Mountain" in Tang poetry refers to the western part of the Yin Mountains; Helan Mountain, which Yue Fei wanted to crush in his *Man Jiang Hong*, is on the bank of the Yellow River near the Tengger Desert. Wang Zhaojun died here on the bank of the Yellow River. Zhaojun's tomb is still on the south bank of the Yellow River in Baotou.

    In recent decades, the rulers of old China have only given this area devastation and ravage, without the slightest construction.

    Deserts and desolation can be created by people, and they can also be conquered by people. In Baotou, there are many obvious contrasts: one side is still a desert, and the other side has become an oasis - farmland, vegetable gardens, and nurseries.

    Legend has it that Yumen Pass, which originally had no spring, had spring because Zuo Zongtang planted three thousand weeping willows. And today, the people fighting in Baotou are not planting three thousand trees. The trees and saplings planted this spring alone have reached more than three million. Now Baotou is building a large reservoir that requires digging 700,000 cubic meters of earth. It is necessary to store mountain floods for irrigation and fish farming. Baotou already has tens of thousands of acres of vegetable gardens, as well as many greenhouses and sunny slopes with cucumbers and rape from the south of the Yangtze River.

    This year, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is preparing to carry out aerial seeding in 1.5 million acres of desert area. According to experiments, on rainy days, sowing seeds of grass and trees suitable for desert growth will quickly allow the seeds to take root in the sand, and once they take root, they will no longer be afraid of the wind.

    With our great Party and socialism, we dare to challenge nature. Let us cheer for Baotou, the promising future of this emerging city!

    包头——雄伟的城市
    田林
    没有到包头以前，虽然也从报纸上知道包头的建设规模很大，但是我怎么也想像不到它是如此的大，如此的雄伟。
    包头市在阴山山脉东部的大青山脚下。仅仅市区，从东到西就足足有六、七十华里。巍峨的大青山自然是非常雄伟的，可是，现在它似乎也显得低矮了。包头钢铁公司刚建成外壳的一号高炉、一号高炉系统的热风炉、水塔和已经投入生产的焦化工厂的烟囱等等，所有这些，全似奇峰高耸，直插云霄。当我去到那好像摩天大厦一样的一号高炉跟前，我不由得惊喜地叫了起来：啊，我从来没有看见过这样高、这样大的高炉呀！工地负责人告诉我，这座高炉的容积达一千五百一十三立方公尺。他说，在我国，目前只有鞍山钢铁公司去年第四季度建成的十号高炉，才能和他比美。

    一到包头，我就有一个非常新鲜的感觉，包头的新市区——包头市的主体，它是全身新装，没有半点儿旧时代留下的破破烂烂、仄小局促的痕迹。新修的宽阔的马路，新盖的整齐而漂亮的工厂、工人宿舍、百货商店、影剧院和学校，新种的嫩绿的街树，工厂里面新式的机器设备……青春的活力洋溢在每一个建设工地上和生产车间里。为了争取包钢早日出铁、出钢和出钢材，今年以来，包头市的十几万职工开展了热火朝天的红旗竞赛，使技术革新和生产建设的新纪录不断地涌现。从1月以来，包头市职工提出的技术革新项目达到了十多万件，其中已经实现的一万多件，对于加快包钢的建设进度，保证工程和产品的质量，节约人力物力等都表现出了巨大的力量。如在包钢一号高炉的工地上就发生过这样一个故事：一个摄影记者去拍施工照片，第一天去的时候，看见洗涤塔才作好底座，他没有拍，等到第三天他去拍的时候，洗涤塔已经完全作好并且穿戴完毕，矗立在他跟前了，结果他只得另找题目。包头机械厂没有大设备，过去也没有作过大机器。但是今年他们大胆地接受了作球磨机的任务。这个球磨机的大牙轮，直径达三公尺多，用什么来加工呢？工人们想了许多办法，最后创造出两台被称为“蛇吞象”和“小猴骑大象”的小机器，把大牙轮作出来了。包头汽车修配厂过去因为缺少配件不能修大卡车，但是职工们采取了旧件复新的办法，解决了二千七百个配件的供应问题，在4月份把包钢所有需要修配的载重汽车都修好投入了运输的行列。

    旧包头，从二百多年前，一个沿着阴山山脉游历的西藏喇嘛在这里盖起第一间茅屋起，到解放前，虽然人口也有几万，但是仅仅是一个塞外皮毛和粮食集散的地方，根本没有什么工业，连手工业也少得可怜。
    黄河流域是我们祖先和祖国文化发祥和繁衍之地，也是后来蒙古人游牧的地区，可以想见在古代绝不是一块荒凉的地方。就是“包头”这个名字也表明包头这个地方原来也富于水草（按包头原为蒙语包克图，意思是有鹿的地方）。由于过去的民族战争和后来的反动统治，使包头黄河中上游的许多地方变得十分荒凉。黄河中上游，曾经是过去匈奴和汉人争战之地。唐诗中“单于猎火照狼山”里的狼山，就是阴山山脉的西部；岳飞满江红词里要踏破的贺兰山，就在腾格里沙漠附近的黄河边上。王昭君就死在这里的黄河边上，昭君墓现在还在包头市区黄河的南岸。
    近几十年来，旧中国的统治者给予这一带的也只是摧残和蹂躏，没有半点儿的建设。
    沙漠、荒凉可以由人造成，同样也可以被人征服。在包头，有许多地方就是这样明显的对比：一边还是沙漠，一边已经变成了绿洲——农田、菜园和苗圃。
    相传原来没有春天的玉门关，由于左宗棠种下了三千棵垂杨柳，也就有了春天了。而今天，战斗在包头的人们不是种的三千棵，仅仅今年春天种下的树和树苗就达到三百多万棵。现在包头正在修建着一个要挖土七十万公方的大水库。要把山洪蓄起来浇地养鱼。包头已经有了上几万亩的菜园，还有许多结着黄瓜、长着江南油菜的温室和阳畦。
    今年内蒙古自治区已准备在一百五十万亩的沙漠地区进行飞机播种。根据实验，在阴雨天，把适宜于沙漠生长的草、树籽撒下去，很快籽种就可以在沙中扎根，而一扎上根，就再不怕风吹了。
    有了我们伟大的党，有了社会主义，我们就敢于向大自然挑战。让我们为包头，这个新兴的城市的万里鹏程而欢呼吧！
