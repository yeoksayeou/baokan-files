Xinhua News Agency, May 15th dispatch from New Delhi, according to the Indian News Service: Prime Minister Nehru held a press conference on May 14th. He first discussed the Tibet issue at the meeting.

Nehru declared: The number of refugees who have arrived or are on their way to Indian territory, or Bhutan or Sikkim, is twelve thousand two hundred. He said, "We have now arranged two camp sites, one in Assam, which can accommodate about five thousand people, and another in Buksa, North Bengal, which can accommodate about one thousand people, or slightly more."

He continued, "I cannot say now what other arrangements we may have to make, but for the young people who are physically strong, we will provide them with opportunities to do some work and make a living after a while. I cannot say exactly now. Perhaps in those mountainous areas, we may use them to build roads, if they agree to do so. It is not easy to bring these people to the plains, because the summer in the plains will be difficult for them to bear."

A reporter asked: "When you were in Mussoorie, you told us that the Dalai Lama wanted to return to Tibet if it could be arranged. How can this be achieved?"

Nehru said: "What I said in Mussoorie, I don't remember how I said it at the time; but no one wants to leave or be forced to leave their country, and people want to go back, which is a natural thing. But the reasons that caused him to leave—as long as those reasons continue to exist, there are probably some obstacles to his going there."

When answering questions from other reporters, Nehru made some justifications for inviting Tibet to attend the "Asian Relations Conference" held in New Delhi, India, in March 1947 as a country. He said: "This conference was organized before we came to power." "We became members of the government before the actual meeting was held. But this conference was still a non-governmental conference, it was not convened under the auspices of the government, but under the auspices of non-official people."

He also said, "This was a mixed conference, essentially non-official, but there were also official factors from outside and here, because we became the government at that time. I remember that in this (conference) process, people from Tibet were invited. I don't remember very clearly how they were invited, I mean, what kind of organization had been invited to send representatives. But they did come. I remember an incident that happened in those days. There was a large, roughly drawn map of Asia drawn in chalk, with some dotted lines between Tibet and China. None of us noticed it. This was done by some artist who hung it there. No one knew about it. But the Chinese representative—that is, the Kuomintang representative—at that time Marshal Chiang Kai-shek was the President of China—objected to these dotted lines. He said, you have drawn Tibet as a country separate from China, and they should not have separate representation. That incident did happen. I can't be very sure, but I think someone erased the dotted lines later. But the Tibetans who came still stayed there. We told them that this was not an official meeting. This is mainly a cultural thing." He did not mention the so-called Tibetan "flag" that was hung at the meeting.

Nehru refuted a reporter's statement that the Soviet Union and China had criticized Nehru, Nasser, etc., for their neutral policies. He pointed out that neither the Soviet Union nor China opposed India's neutral policy. He said he "does not remember China criticizing our neutral policy."

When Nehru was asked if he agreed with the "People's Daily" in Beijing that China had full sovereignty over Tibet, he said, "China's statement has always been the same, I know what suzerainty and sovereignty mean in English, but I don't know what they mean in Chinese. I don't know their exact meaning, but their statements have been almost the same throughout the long historical periods." "In the past, there was sometimes a high-ranking Chinese official called the Resident Minister in Tibet stationed in Lhasa, enjoying considerable control, almost like the Resident Representative in India, like the old British Resident Representatives stationed in the Indian states. There have been such various kinds of controls in the past, and sometimes no control at all. You can draw any conclusions you want to make, but the fact is that you have to look at this situation based on the current situation."

A reporter asked Nehru if his impression was that as long as the Dalai Lama stayed in India, there would inevitably be some tension in the relationship between India and China?

Nehru said, "Well, it is quite difficult to look into the future, but perhaps you are right, the Dalai Lama staying here will indeed cause a certain degree of that kind of tension."

Nehru, talking about the ongoing Geneva Foreign Ministers' meeting, said, "I just want to say I wish it success." He said, "Both sides put forward one proposal after another, and the result is opposition, so there is a tense situation, and then some minor agreements are reached, and then they move on to the next step. I think this situation will continue for a while, but people should not expect this meeting to end soon. I think it will lead to what people call a summit meeting. If people expect anything to happen, it will really come from the summit meeting, mainly not from this meeting. I can only say that this meeting may lay the foundation for a certain summit meeting."

When a reporter drew his attention to the fact that Pakistani President Ayub Khan had reiterated his willingness to reach an understanding with India, Nehru said, "It is always good to hear such words. But at present, besides other incidents, we have not completely forgotten the Canberra-type aircraft incident."

A reporter asked if Ayub Khan had made any proposals for a meeting with Nehru or negotiations with India? He replied that there were no such formal or informal proposals.

A reporter asked if former US Ambassador to India Bowles had said that it might be useful for Ayub Khan to hold talks with Nehru?

Nehru said, "At present, I doubt it very much. Talks themselves do not produce results, unless the situation, circumstances, and everything else reach a level sufficient to produce results."

Nehru talked about the Indian government's talks with World Bank President Black on the issue of river waters in the north, which has long been a dispute between India and Pakistan. Nehru said, "I always try to be optimistic." He said, "But there are some rather serious obstacles along the way. Perhaps, we will try to overcome them."

Nehru said that the World Bank's recent proposal on resolving the India-Pakistan canal water dispute is "financially very expensive, which seems terribly large to us, and the period is very long."

He said that the Mangla Dam had been mentioned in negotiations with the World Bank, although not directly. He said, "We protested to the Security Council last year, pointing out that this is Indian territory, although this place is currently occupied by Pakistan. Therefore, we protested to the Security Council. Of course, we cannot accept any method that deprives India of that right."

When talking about the International Commission for Vietnam, Nehru said, "The general situation is that the commission has not made much progress in achieving the goals set for it at the Geneva Conference. But it has done very beneficial and important things. It has prevented conflicts between North and South Vietnam. I believe that they said in their report that if the commission no longer existed, the situation might gradually develop into a situation that would cause conflict, actual conflict. In other words, the commission must continue to exist."

Nehru also talked about some domestic issues, such as the alliance with the Democratic Congress Party in Orissa and the situation in Kerala, etc. Nehru announced that a new oil exploration committee would be established, and the government would begin to nationally control India's oil distribution.

    在5月14日举行的记者招待会上
    尼赫鲁谈有关西藏等问题
    新华社15日讯　据印度新闻处新德里消息：尼赫鲁总理5月14日举行了记者招待会。他在会上首先谈到了西藏问题。
    尼赫鲁宣称：已经来到或者正在途中、已经进入印度领土、或者不丹或者锡金的难民，数字是一万二千二百人。他说，“现在我们已经安排了两个营场，一个在阿萨姆，可以容纳五千人左右，另一个在北孟加拉邦的布克萨，可以容纳大约一千人或者稍微多一些。”
    他接着说，“我现在无法说我们可能必须作出其他什么安排，但是对于身体强壮的青年人，我们过些时候要向他们提供做某种工作和谋生的机会。我现在不能确切地说明。可能在那些山区，我们也许会利用他们来筑路，如果他们同意这样做的话。使这些人到平原上来不是很容易的，因为平原上的夏天对他们说来将是很难忍受的。”
    一位记者问：“你在穆索里的时候曾经告诉我们，达赖喇嘛很想回西藏，假如能够安排这件事情的话。怎样才能获得这个结果呢？”
    尼赫鲁说：“我在穆索里说的话，我记不起我当时是怎么说的了；但是，没有人希望离开或者被迫离开自己的国家，人们希望回去，这是很自然的事。但是促使他离开的原因——只要那些原因继续存在，他要到那里去大概是有某些障碍的。”
    尼赫鲁在回答别的记者的问题的时候，对1947年3月在印度新德里召开的“亚洲关系会议”邀请西藏作为一个国家出席会议一事作了一些辩解。他说：“这次会议是在我们执政之前组织的”。“在举行实际会议之前，我们变成了政府成员。可是这次会议仍然是非政府会议，它不是在政府主持下召开的，而是在非官方人士主持下召开的。”
    他又说，“这是一个混合的会议，实质上是非官方的，可是其中也有来自外界和这里的官方因素，由于当时我们变成了政府。我记得，在这个（会议）过程中，曾经邀请来自西藏的人。我记得不太清楚是怎么邀请他们的，我的意思是说，什么样的组织曾经被邀请派遣代表来。可是他们的确来了。我记得在那些日子里发生的一个事件。有一幅用粉笔画的画得很粗糙的很大的亚洲地图，在西藏和中国之间有一些虚线。我们中间谁也没有注意到它。这是把它挂在那里的某个艺术家干的事。谁也不知道这回事。可是中国代表——也就是说国民党代表——当时蒋介石元帅是中国总统——对这些虚线表示反对。他说，你们把西藏画成一个同中国分开的国家了，他们不应该有单独的代表权。那个事件是发生了。我不能很肯定，可是我想后来有人把虚线擦掉了。可是前来的西藏人还是留在那里。我们告诉他们，这不是官方会议。这主要是文化性的事情。”他没有提到关于在这个会议上挂出的所谓西藏“国旗”的问题。
    尼赫鲁反驳了某个记者关于苏联和中国就中立政策对尼赫鲁、纳赛尔等提出了批评的说法。他指出，无论是苏联或中国都没有反对印度的中立政策。他说，他“不记得中国批评过我们的中立政策”。
    尼赫鲁在回答他是否同意北京“人民日报”所提出的中国对西藏拥有充分的主权的说法时说，“中国的说法一直是一样的，宗主权和主权在英文里的意思我是知道的，但是它在中文里的意思我不知道。我不知道它们的确切含意，但是在各个漫长的历史时期内，他们的说法差不多一直是一样的。”“在过去，有时偶尔有一位叫做驻藏大臣的中国高级官员驻在拉萨，享有相当大的控制权，差不多就像驻印代表，驻在印度各邦的旧时候的英国驻印代表一样。过去有过这样一些各种各样的控制权，有时候则没有任何控制权。你可以得出你想作出的任何结论，但是事实是，你必须根据目前的情况来看待这种局势。”
    有记者问尼赫鲁，他的印象是不是只要达赖喇嘛呆在印度，印度同中国之间的关系就一定会存在某种紧张状态？
    尼赫鲁说，“嗯，展望将来是相当困难的，不过可能你的话是对的，达赖喇嘛呆在这里的确会引起一定程度的那种紧张状态。”
    尼赫鲁谈到目前正在举行的日内瓦外长会议时说，“我只想说祝它成功。”他说，“双方提出一个又一个的建议，结果遭到了反对，于是就出现紧张的局面，接着达成某些次要的协议，然后他们就进到下一步。我想这种情况将继续一段时间，但是人们不会期望这个会议会很快结束。我想它会导致人们所说的最高级会议。如果人们期望发生任何事情的话，那实在将来自最高级会议，主要不会来自这个会议。我只能这样说，这次会议可能会为某个最高级会议奠定基础。”
    当记者提请他注意巴基斯坦总统阿尤布汗再次重申愿意同印度谅解时，尼赫鲁说，“听到这种话总是好的。可是目前，除了其他事件外，我们还没有完全忘掉堪培拉式飞机事件。”
    有记者问，阿尤布汗是否提出任何关于同尼赫鲁会谈或同印度谈判的建议？他回答说，没有那种正式的或非正式的建议。
    有记者问到前美国驻印度大使鲍尔士是否说过阿尤布汗同尼赫鲁举行会谈可能是有用处的？
    尼赫鲁说，“在目前我非常怀疑这一点。会谈本身并不产生结果，除非形势、情况和一切东西达到足以产生结果的程度。”
    尼赫鲁谈到了印度政府正在同世界银行行长布莱克会谈关于北部一些河流的河水问题，这个问题长期以来是印度和巴基斯坦两国之间的争端之一。尼赫鲁说，“我总是设法采取乐观态度”。他说，“但是在途中有一些相当严重的障碍。可能，我们将设法克服它们。”
    尼赫鲁说，世界银行最近提出的关于解决印巴运河河水争端的建议“在财政上用费很大，在我们看来大得了不得，而且时期很长”。
    他说，在同世界银行的谈判中提到过曼格拉水坝，虽然不是直接的。他说，“我们去年曾向安全理事会提出过抗议，指出这是印度的领土，虽然这个地方目前是被巴基斯坦所占领的。因此我们在安全理事会提出了抗议。当然我们不能接受任何剥夺印度的那种权利的办法。”
    在谈到越南国际委员会的时候，尼赫鲁说，“总的情况是，委员会在实现在日内瓦会议上为它规定的目标方面没有取得多大进展。但它做了很有益的事情和很重要的事情。它防止了北越和南越发生冲突。我相信，他们在他们的报告中说，如果委员会不再存在的话，局势可能逐渐地发展成引起冲突的局势，实际上的冲突。换句话说，委员会必须继续存在。”
    尼赫鲁还谈到一些国内问题，例如在奥里萨邦同民主大会党联合的问题和喀拉拉邦形势等等。尼赫鲁宣布将要成立新的开采石油委员会，政府将开始由国家控制印度的石油分配。
