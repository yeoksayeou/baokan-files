    In the overlapping mountains and verdant forests of the Himalayas, it is now the season of blooming flowers and singing birds. The Tibetan people living in Yadong, after assisting the People's Liberation Army in suppressing the bandits, are all overjoyed and in high spirits, immersed in the joy of celebrating their new life. In every village, songs and shouts rise one after another, and girls and boys dance all night long. The elderly Tibetan men and women put on new clothes, washed their hands, and hung white hadas on the portraits of Chairman Mao. Tibetan children picked various flowers on the Himalayas and presented them in front of Chairman Mao's portrait. When the bandits harassed this area, many women did not dare to go out, but now they sing mountain songs while weeding in the tender green fields.

    On the afternoon of April 25th, residents from more than a dozen mountain villages, including Galinggang, Baimugang, Ganggu, and Zhuju in the Himalayan region, held a carnival of over a thousand people in Wubinggang Village to celebrate the new life of the Tibetan people.

    That evening, regardless of gender or age, everyone dressed in festive costumes, brought highland barley wine for the festival, carried kerosene lamps, and held torches, traveling from dozens of miles away to participate in the celebration. The venue for the evening party was set up under a large manor's flower awning, where the Tibetans inlaid gold around the portrait of Chairman Mao, and hung bright red five-star red flags on both sides of the portrait. Auspicious colorful banners representing solemn celebration were hung on the eaves, and large slogans written in Tibetan were plastered all over the venue: "Celebrate the eternal new life of the Tibetan people!" "Long live the unity of the great motherland!" "Long live the great unity of all ethnic groups!" "Long live Chairman Mao, the most beloved leader of all ethnic groups!" "Long live the Chinese Communist Party!"

    The evening party began with thunderous applause from the Tibetans. Luo Zhui, the representative of Wubinggang Village, spoke first. He said, "Under the wise leadership and kind care of the great Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the great snow mountain that weighed on our heads—the reactionary Tibetan local government—has been overthrown, and the bandits who brought disaster to the country and the people have been suppressed. We have been reborn forever." His emotional speech aroused thunderous applause and cheers from the entire audience. At this time, the young people present sang songs in Tibetan such as "Unity is Strength," "Socialism is Good," and "The Sky in the Liberated Area is a Bright Sky."

    Zhao Ruiting, secretary of the CPC Yadong Committee, was also invited to attend this celebration and delivered a speech, congratulating the Tibetan people on their new life. He said: The new life of the Tibetan people is not only a victory for the Tibetan people, but also a victory for all ethnic groups in the country, and a brilliant victory for the central government and Chairman Mao's great ethnic policies. He also congratulated everyone on taking big strides towards a happy and fulfilling socialist path.

    After he finished speaking, the beautiful folk dances of the Himalayan region began. Girls and boys in beautiful clothes sang and danced, singing their newly composed songs:

    A place shrouded in dark clouds needs the sun,
    Tibetan people devastated by bandits need the Communist Party.
    The Communist Party's kindness is higher than the mountains and deeper than the sea.
    We celebrate the new life and will never forget the Communist Party. …

    As the joyous singing ended, an old man in his sixties, Suo Nandanzeng, walked out of the crowd to speak. He said: My old man's hair is all white, and I have never been so excited before. This is because: Today's Tibet is the people's own Tibet, no longer a place where that small handful of reactionaries can kill at will. He continued, "A few days ago, bandits plundered wildly in Akang, Doulong and other places, robbing a large number of cattle, sheep, and ghee. Many families were left empty-handed. The bandits also raped women and committed all kinds of evil. Now these bandits have been wiped out by our powerful army suppressing the rebellion, the darkness and dark clouds have been driven away by the sun, and the light is shining on our way forward."

    Many programs expressing the joy of the Tibetan people were also performed at the evening party. Representatives from many villages also spoke, expressing their joyful feelings.

    Now, the highland barley in the Himalayas has grown a foot high. The vast Tibetan people, amidst cheers, have launched a production campaign to reclaim wasteland, plant experimental fields, try planting rice, build irrigation canals, and plant apple trees. At the same time, many villages are actively organizing livestock and drawing out capable personnel to fully support the army suppressing the rebellion and eliminate the remaining bandits.

    It was late at night when we walked down the Himalayas, and the jubilant singing and dancing in Wubinggang Village were still continuing.

    亚东人民欢庆新生
    新华社记者　格来
    在山峦重叠、林木苍翠的喜马拉雅山区，现在正是百花齐放，百鸟争鸣的季节。居住在亚东的藏族人民，在协助人民解放军肃清了叛匪以后，个个欢天喜地，扬眉吐气，浸沉在喜庆自己新生的欢乐里。在各个村子里，歌声、号子声此起彼伏，姑娘们和小伙子们翩翩起舞，通宵达旦。年老的藏族老大爷和大娘们穿上了新衣服，洗净了手，把一条条洁白的哈达挂在毛主席的像上。藏族儿童们，在喜马拉雅山上采摘了各种鲜花敬献在毛主席的像前。在叛匪骚扰这个地区时，很多妇女不敢出门，现在她们唱着山歌在嫩绿的田野里锄草。
    4月25日下午，居住在喜马拉雅山区噶岭岗、白木岗、岗谷、珠聚等十几个山村的居民，在武斌岗村举行了一千多人的狂欢晚会，欢庆西藏人民获得新生。
    这天晚上，不分男女老幼，都穿上了节日的盛装，带着在节日喝的青稞酒，手提着汽灯，打着火把，从数十里路以外赶来参加联欢。晚会会场布置在一个大庄院的花幄篷底下，藏民们在毛主席像的周围镶上了金边，鲜红的五星红旗，挂在毛主席像的两边。屋檐上挂起了表示隆重喜庆的吉祥彩幡，会场上贴满了用藏文写的大幅标语：“欢庆西藏人民的永远新生！”“伟大祖国的统一万岁！”“各族人民大团结万岁！”“各族人民最敬爱的毛主席万岁！”“中国共产党万岁！”
    晚会在藏民们雷动般的掌声中开始了，武斌岗村的代表洛缀首先讲话。他说：“在伟大的中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导和亲切关怀下，压在我们头上的一座大雪山——反动的西藏地方政府被掀掉了，祸国殃民的叛匪被肃清了，我们永远新生了。”他这段充满感情的讲话，引起全场响起了雷鸣般的掌声和欢呼声。这时到会的青年们用藏语唱起了“团结就是力量”、“社会主义好”和“解放区的天是明朗的天”等歌曲。
    在这天的欢庆晚会上，中共亚东委员会书记赵瑞亭也应邀出席，并在会上讲了话，祝贺西藏人民获得了新生。他说：西藏人民获得新生，不仅是藏族人民的胜利，也是全国各族人民的胜利，是中央和毛主席伟大的民族政策的辉煌胜利。他并祝贺大家迈开大步，向着幸福、美满的社会主义的大道前进。
    他讲完话以后，优美的喜马拉雅山区的民间舞蹈开始了，穿着美丽衣服的姑娘们和小伙子们载歌载舞，唱起了他们最近新编的歌子：
    乌云迷漫的地方需要太阳，
    惨遭叛匪蹂躏的藏民需要共产党。
    共产党的恩情比山高，比海水还深。
    我们欢庆新生，永远忘不了共产党。……
    欢乐的歌声刚落，一个六十多岁的老人锁南丹曾，从人群里走出来讲话。他说：我老汉的头发都白了，从来也没有这样兴奋过。这是因为：今天的西藏是人民自己的西藏了，再不是那一小撮反动派随意杀生的西藏了。他接着说，前些日子，叛匪在阿康、斗隆等地大肆抢掠，抢走了大批牛羊和酥油，很多人家被劫一空。叛匪还奸淫妇女，无恶不作。现在这些叛匪已经被我们强大的平叛大军肃清了，黑暗和乌云被太阳赶走了，光明在照耀着我们前进的道路。
    晚会上还演出了许多表达藏民欢乐的节目。很多村庄的代表也讲了话，说出了他们喜悦的心情。
    现在，喜马拉雅山区的青稞已经长得一尺高了，广大的藏民们，在一片欢腾声中，掀起了一个开荒生产，种试验田，试种稻子，修水渠、栽苹果树的生产运动。很多村庄的藏民同时积极组织畜力和抽出得力的人员全面支援平叛大军，肃清残余的叛匪。
    夜深了，当我们走下喜马拉雅山时，武斌岗村里欢腾的歌舞声，仍在继续着。
