	A Group of Female Commune Members
	Liu Yanru
	Liu Jinmei led a group of female commune members in applying topdressing fertilizer to the autumn crops in the fields.
	People say that in the seventh lunar month, the fiery sun is at its most venomous, making people sweat buckets! In the Weishi Management Area of the Pingding Commune in Yangquan City, Shanxi Province, the autumn seedlings were growing neatly, drooping their heads under the sunlight, gasping for breath. Jinmei and her colleagues, each carrying a dustpan, squatted in the field, moving step by step, applying soil fertilizer to the roots of these small seedlings. Sweat poured down their faces, and their clothes were soaked. Their spines felt broken, and they couldn't straighten up for a long time after standing. Liu Jinmei, the female deputy director of the commune, used to chat and laugh while working, but today, she kept a straight face, staring blankly at the seedlings. Zhang Guiying, a female commune member, laughed at her silly appearance: "Jinmei, what are you staring at so intently? Haven't you ever seen crops before?" Jinmei turned her head and smiled.
	The evening breeze, like a clear spring, washed away the day's sultriness. As soon as dinner was over, the streets were filled with people enjoying the cool air. Liu Jinmei and the women's team leader, Yue Jilin, were seen carrying a seed drill to the commune office.
	The autumn crops had already been sown, so what were they doing with the seed drill? Some nosy people ran to the commune office to see what was up. In the commune office, the Party branch secretary, Liang Yongfu, and the commune director, Xi Taibao, were both present. Jinmei was pointing at the seed drill and gesturing, saying: "If we put soil fertilizer in this seed box and replace the seed drill legs with thicker spouts, we can ensure that the fertilizer is applied evenly. The seed box is small, so we can make it bigger." The branch secretary and the commune director both nodded. However, this thing is different from a seed drill. The legs shouldn't touch the ground, so how can it move? Liu Jinmei said: "Jilin and I have been thinking about it for a long time, but we can't solve this problem. We need your help to come up with a solution!"
	The four of them, some were holding up the seed drill to try it out, some were scratching on the ground, and some were frowning in a daze. Those who came to see the spectacle left when they saw it wasn't interesting. However, the next day, the villagers all knew that Liu Jinmei was going to invent a machine.
	Why not put wheels on the machine so it can be pushed? What a simple solution that took so much brainpower! It kept them up most of the night.
	Early the next morning, Jinmei, with red eyes, took the drawings to find the carpenter, Wang Delu. Jinmei was excited, afraid that Delu wouldn't understand, and explained what this was and what that was. After explaining for a long time, Wang Delu glanced at the drawings and said: "I've lived for over fifty years, and I've never done anything like this. It's neither a cart nor a seed drill. I can't do it!" This rejection stunned Jinmei for a moment, but she still pleaded with him in a nice way. Wang Delu just sat on the doorstep smoking, ignoring her. After a long while, he snorted from his nose and said: "You women want to create something? That's ridiculous!"
	Ridiculous or not, they had to do it. The Party branch secretary and the commune director called a meeting of all the village's ironworkers and carpenters, and Wang Delu had no choice but to work with a pout.
	"The fertilizer applicator is done!" Jinmei and Jilin pushed the finished fertilizer applicator to the field, and the women and children cheered loudly from afar. A group of children, like watching a festive event, ran behind them, shouting and yelling. The female commune members also came to greet them, surrounding the "new product." One person was vying to say: Let me try it! Another was scrambling to push it. Jilin and other female commune members even suggested giving the machine a name. In the end, they decided to call it the "Double-Row Seedling Fertilizer Applicator."
	They tested it for half an afternoon, fertilizing seven and a half mu. People no longer had to bend over backwards to suffer, and the work was done very quickly. But the next day, when they went to the field, they saw that the seedlings were all leaning to one side or the other, as if they had been trampled on, or as if they had been blown by a strong wind. The female commune members were chattering and discussing. Jinmei frowned and said nothing. At this time, Guo Shunshan, who was eighty-some years old, Kang Fuqing, who was seventy-seven years old, and Liu Yuying, who was sixty-some years old, squatted at the edge of the field, making sarcastic remarks: "All just fooling around! In the past, only Lu Ban, the deity of carpentry, could create tools! Look, now these young whippersnappers think they can surpass the deities!" Jinmei ignored them. She suddenly said: "Everyone, stop speculating! Look!" Everyone's attention immediately focused on the wooden wheels of the fertilizer applicator. The diameter of the wooden wheels was five inches, which was too small to support the machine, causing it to damage the seedlings. She had the carpenter replace them with larger wooden wheels, and the fertilizer applicator ran smoothly in the field. Compared to before, when one person could fertilize less than one mu per day, now two people can apply topdressing fertilizer to twenty mu per day, increasing efficiency by more than nine times.

    一伙女社员
    刘燕如
    刘金美领着一伙女社员在地里给秋田上追肥。
    人说，七月流火，太阳正毒，晒得人流油呢！山西省阳泉市平定公社维社管理区的秋苗长得齐刷刷的，在太阳光下搭拉着脑袋喘气儿。金美她们每人端着个簸箕，蹲在地里一步一挪地就往这些小苗根部上土化肥，脸上的汗珠儿泼拉泼拉地往下掉，衣裳全沾在身上了。腰脊骨像折断了一样，站起来好半天直不起腰。刘金美是这个社的女副社长，往常干活计有说有笑，今天，她绷着脸，死盯着小苗发楞。女社员张桂英瞧着她这傻样笑了：“金美这孩死盯着看什么，还没见过这个庄稼？”金美扭头笑了一笑。
    晚风像一股清泉冲净了人们一天浑身的闷燥，晚饭刚罢，街上坐满了乘凉的人，只见刘金美和妇女队长岳计林抬着个耧去社办公室去了。
    秋作物早已全部下种，抬耧去干什么呢？有些好事的人就跑到社办公室里瞧稀罕去。在社办公室里党支部书记梁永福和社主任郗太保都在场，金美正指着耧比划着说：这籽箱里装上土化肥，耧腿换成粗漏筒，肥料保准能上匀，籽箱小，咱们可以做大点。”支部书记和社主任都点着头。可是，这东西和耧不一样，腿不能挨地，怎走呢？刘金美说：“我和计林想了半天了，就是这问题解决不了，你们帮助想点办法呢！”
    他们四个人，有的掌起耧试试，有的在地下圪划，有的绉着眉发呆。看稀罕的看见不稀罕都走了。但是，第二天，村里的人就都知道刘金美要发明机器的事了。
  给机器上安个轮子，不就能推着走了吗？多叫人费脑筋的简单办法呀！害得他们多半夜没睡。
    第二天一早，金美红着眼，拿着图样去找木匠王德禄。金美兴冲冲，唯恐德禄看不懂，给说这是啥，那是什么。说了半天，王德禄拿图纸看了一眼，说：“我活了五十多了，没干过这号营生，车不像车，耧不像耧的，咱干不了！”这钉子碰得金美怔了一下，但还是好言好语央求着。王德禄却坐在门坎上只管吸烟，理也不理她，半晌，才从鼻子里哼了一声说：“你们这伙妇女还想创造哩，真是胡闹三关！”
    胡闹三关也得闹，党支部书记和社主任召集全村铁木匠开了个会，王德禄只好噘着嘴干。
    “施肥机做成了！”金美和计林把做好的施肥机推到地里，妇女和孩子们远远地就大声欢呼起来。一群小孩子们像看红火似的，跟在后头跑着、叫着。女社员也迎了来，团团围住了这部“新产品”，这个争着说：让我试一试；那个抢着要推推。计林等几个女社员还提议要给这部机器起个名字，最后决定叫它“双垅小苗施肥机”。
    试验了半下午，施肥施了七亩半，人再不要折成三折子受罪了，活计做得也真快。可是第二天到地里一看，苗子都东倒西歪，像是被人踩过似的，又像让大风吹了。女社员叽叽喳喳的议论着。金美却绉着眉头不说话。这时候，八十来岁的郭顺山和七十七岁的康福庆，六十多岁的刘毓英三个人蹲在地头卖开风凉话了：“尽胡闹哩！过去鲁班神仙才会创造工具呢！你看，现在这伙年青毛孩子倒想赛过神仙！”金美没有理睬他们，她忽然说：“大家别乱猜疑了，你们看！”人们的视线一下便集中到施肥机的木轮上，木轮的直径是五寸，小了些，架不起来，以致闯坏了苗。她让木匠给换了个大木轮，这架施肥机就在地里痛痛快快地跑开了。这和以前比起来，以前一个人施肥一天还不到一亩，现在两个人一天就能施追肥二十亩，提高了效率九倍多。
