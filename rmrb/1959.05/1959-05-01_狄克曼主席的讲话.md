Chairman Dieckmann's Speech

Respectable Chairman Zhu De of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China, dear friends and comrades:

    Please allow me to express, on behalf of the delegation of the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic, our heartfelt gratitude for such a warm welcome. On behalf of all the people of the German Democratic Republic, I salute our friend, Comrade Zhu De, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress of the People's Republic of China, and also the fraternal people of the People's Republic of China. I would like to take this opportunity to thank Comrade Liu Shaoqi for inviting us. Before visiting your country, we traveled for three weeks, during which we visited India, Ceylon, and our fraternal Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

    Dear friends, we are very happy to be able to meet with you. We believe that this visit to China by the delegation of the People's Chamber of the German Democratic Republic is of great significance. It is the first time in the history of relations between China and Germany that a delegation from the People's Chamber has visited you. In the past, some Germans came to China, but we are different from them. We come from your beloved German Democratic Republic. We are here to learn from China's experience in socialist construction and to understand the situation of China's socialist construction. During this visit, we will also exchange views with Chinese leaders on issues of common concern. We know how much help the great Chinese people give to the issues that concern the people of the German Democratic Republic. Therefore, I would like to take this opportunity to express my heartfelt respect and gratitude to the great Chinese people and to the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. We know how much help the Chinese people have given to the people of the German Democratic Republic in their struggle for national reunification and for the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany. Just as you help us, the German people will always stand by the Chinese people and always support the Chinese people's just struggle, supporting your struggle to liberate Taiwan. All conspiracies are doomed to failure. I believe that German unification will be realized one day, and Taiwan will be liberated one day. I once again thank you for your wonderful reception. I wish you new achievements in the great cause of building your motherland. Let me shout: Long live the unbreakable friendship between the Chinese and German people! Long live the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union! Long live world peace!

    狄克曼主席的讲话敬爱的中华人民共和国全国人民代表大会常务委员会朱德委员长：亲爱的朋友们、同志们：
    请允许我代表德意志民主共和国人民议院代表团对你们这样的热烈欢迎表示衷心的感谢。我代表德意志民主共和国全体人民对欢迎我们的朋友——中华人民共和国全国人民代表大会常务委员会委员长朱德同志，同时也向兄弟的中华人民共和国人民致敬，我愿意在这里感谢刘少奇同志对我们的邀请。我们在访问你们的国家以前曾经作了三个星期的旅行，在这个期间，我们访问了印度、锡兰，并且访问了我们兄弟的越南民主共和国。
    亲爱的朋友们，我们感到很高兴能够和你们聚会，我们认为德意志民主共和国人民议院代表团这次来中国访问是有很重大的意义，人民议院代表团访问你们，这在中国和德国关系的历史上还是第一次。过去历史上曾经有些德国人来中国，但我们不同于这些人，我们来自你们很敬爱的德意志民主共和国。我们这次来访问是为了学习中国社会主义建设的经验，了解中国社会主义建设的情况。我们这次来访问还将同中国领导人就我们共同关心的问题交换意见。我们知道，伟大的中国人民对德意志民主共和国人民所关切的问题是给予多么大的帮助。因此我愿利用这机会向伟大的中国人民，向全国人民代表大会常务委员会表示衷心的敬意和感谢。我们知道中国人民对德意志民主共和国人民的争取祖国统一，争取缔结对德和约的斗争，给了多么巨大的帮助，正像你们对我们的帮助一样，德国人民将永远站在中国人民这一边，永远支持中国人民的正义斗争，支持你们解放台湾的斗争。一切阴谋都是注定要失败的，我相信，德国统一，总有一天要实现，台湾总有一天将获得解放。我再一次感谢你们美好的接待。祝你们在建设祖国的伟大事业中取得新的成就，让我高呼：中德两国人民牢不可破的友谊万岁！以苏联为首的社会主义阵营团结万岁！世界和平万岁！
