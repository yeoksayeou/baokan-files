　　Beautiful and Novel Paper-Cut Illustrations
　　Wu Shan
    The "Collection of One Hundred Flowers," created by folk paper-cut artists Zhang Jigen and Rui Jinfu from Nanjing, along with several art workers, based on Comrade Guo Moruo's collection of poems "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom," has been published by Jiangsu Literature and Art Publishing House. This is a set of paper-cut illustrations with a unique style. In the creative process, due to the collective effort, and especially after the artists' painstaking management and ingenious handling, this set of paper-cuts radiates an unusual brilliance. The compositions are full, the forms are diverse, and the colors are simple. It inherits the characteristics of Nanjing paper-cuts and has new developments and creations. Each piece is created with various different shapes such as squares, rectangles, circles, ellipses, and vase shapes, according to the characteristics and nature of the flower, which is very decorative. Moreover, the problem of fragility of paper-cuts is also compensated for by the connection of the outer frame line and the middle line.
    Among these more than one hundred paper-cuts, each one has different changes, but the whole looks relatively unified and coordinated. The theme of the works is prominent, which can meet the basic requirements of this collection of poems "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom." The composition generally does not adhere to natural forms, but can grasp the beautiful characteristics, and give the necessary exaggeration and richness. The parts that are not beautiful are omitted or covered with flowers. It achieves the goal of taking advantage of the material and guiding the branches towards the leaves. Especially in the contrast of black and white, virtual and real, it is balanced and natural. In the organization and application of lines, there is fineness in roughness, agility in clumsiness, fullness and beauty.
    For example, in the "Lycoris" piece, according to its growth form, leaves should grow on the bulb, stems should come out of the leaves, and flowers should grow on the stems. If it is drawn as it is, the unattractive parts of the leaves and stems occupy most of the middle of the picture. It has the characteristics of Lycoris, but it is not beautiful. Later, breaking through the shackles of natural form, the artist boldly made two flowers grow out from the bulb on both sides, and gave them special exaggeration, and reduced the leaves and bulbs. With this arrangement, the empty middle section is removed, and the beautiful and main parts are refined and enriched. Although it is different from real Lycoris, it still looks like Lycoris. This artistic processing technique with a romantic color of "similar and dissimilar" can also be seen in some other paintings, which will not be listed here. In short, this is a set of novel and unique illustrations, worthy of being introduced to everyone.
    In recent years, with the needs of various aspects, the art of paper-cutting has developed greatly. However, it is still a new attempt to use paper-cut form to illustrate poems. It is believed that with the development of the entire culture and art, the art of paper-cutting will also be more widely used. (Attached pictures)

　　美丽新颖的剪纸插图
　　吴山
    南京市的民间剪纸艺人张吉根芮金富和几位美术工作者，根据郭沫若同志的诗集“百花齐放”所创作的“百花图集”，已由江苏文艺出版社出版了。这是一套别具风格的剪纸插图。在创作过程中，由于发挥了集体的力量，特别经过艺人们的苦心经营和巧妙的处理，所以使这一套剪纸放射出了异样的光彩。构图饱满、形式多样、色彩单纯，既继承了南京剪纸的特点，又有新的发挥和创造。每一幅都按花的特点和性质，创造了方形、长方形、圆形、椭圆形和花瓶形等各种不同的外形，很有装饰性。而且由于外框线和中间线的连接，使剪纸易于破碎的毛病也得到了弥补。
    在这一百余幅剪纸中，每一幅都有不同的变化，但整个看去又比较统一协调。作品的主题突出，能符合“百花齐放”这本诗集的基本要求，构图上一般都不拘泥于自然形态，能抓住美的特点，予以必要的夸张和丰富，不美的部分又设法省略或用花遮去。做到了依材取势，行枝趋叶。尤其在黑白、虚实的对比上，均衡自然，在线条的组织和运用上，粗中有细、笨中带灵、丰满而优美。
    如“石蒜”一幅，按它的生长形态，应该蒜上生叶，叶中出梗，梗上生花。假如照样画出来叶与梗不美的部分占了画面中间的大部，石蒜的特征是有，但是不美。后来突破了自然形态的束缚，大胆的将两朵花从蒜上分两边长出来，并予以特别的夸张，叶和蒜给以缩小。这样安排，中间一段空虚的去掉了，美的、主要的得到了提炼和丰富。虽说和真的石蒜有别，但看去仍像石蒜。这种“似与不似”带有浪漫色彩的艺术处理手法，在其他一些画幅中也可以看到，这里不列举了。总之，这是一套新颖、别致的插图，值得向大家介绍。
    剪纸艺术，这几年来随着各方面需要，已有了很大的发展，但是用剪纸形式给诗歌作插图，这还是一个新的尝试。相信随着整个文化艺术的发展，剪纸艺术也将会得到更广的运用。（附图片）
