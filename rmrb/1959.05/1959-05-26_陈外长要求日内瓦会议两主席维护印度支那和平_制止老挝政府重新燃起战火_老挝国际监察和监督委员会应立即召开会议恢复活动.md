Xinhua News Agency, May 25th - Chen Yi, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China, sent a letter to the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference on Indochina, Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko and British Foreign Secretary Lloyd, regarding the armed attacks launched by the Royal Lao Government against the former Pathet Lao Fighting Units and the close surveillance and house arrest of Lao Patriotic Party leaders. He requested the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom, as participants in the Geneva Conference, and especially as chairmen of the conference, to immediately take measures to stop the serious actions of the Royal Lao Government in violating the Geneva Agreements, and to instruct the International Commission for Laos to immediately convene a meeting to resume activities.

Zhang Wentian and Luo Guibo, Vice Ministers of Foreign Affairs of China, received Soviet Ambassador to China Yudin and British Chargé d'Affaires to China Wen Yusheng on May 25th respectively, and handed them Foreign Minister Chen Yi's letter to the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference. The content of the letter is as follows:

"I would like to draw your attention to my letter to you on February 19, 1959, regarding the unilateral tearing up of the Geneva Agreements by the Kingdom of Laos. Since then, the situation in Laos has not only not improved, but has continued to deteriorate. Recently, the situation has become even more serious due to the Royal Lao Government's attempt to eliminate the former Pathet Lao Fighting Units. Disregarding the Geneva Agreements and the agreements reached between the Royal Lao Government and the former Pathet Lao Fighting Units in December 1956 and November 1957, the Pei Sananikon government ordered the disarming of two battalions of the former Pathet Lao Fighting Units on May 11, 1959. At the same time, the military and police of the Royal Government surrounded the residences of the Lao Patriotic Party and the leaders of the former Pathet Lao Fighting Units, placing them under close surveillance and house arrest. This is the most serious violation of the Geneva Agreements.

"The measures now taken by the Royal Lao Government against the Lao Patriotic Party and the former Pathet Lao Fighting Units are being carried out under the direct instigation and support of the United States. These actions are rekindling the flames of war that have been extinguished for several years, seriously threatening the peace of Indochina, and greatly exacerbating the tense situation in Southeast Asia. As a participant in the 1954 Geneva Conference and one of the guarantors of the Geneva Agreements, the People's Republic of China cannot naturally sit idly by.

"Now, Pham Van Dong, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, has formally requested the two chairmen of the 1954 Geneva Conference to take urgent and effective measures to ensure that the Geneva Agreements on Laos are respected and fully implemented. I believe this request is entirely justified and reasonable. I also believe that at this critical moment, as participants in the 1954 Geneva Conference, and especially as chairmen of the conference, the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom should immediately take measures to stop this serious violation of the Geneva Agreements by the Royal Lao Government in order to maintain the Geneva Agreements and the peace of Indochina, and instruct the International Control and Supervision Commission for Laos to immediately convene a meeting and resume activities."

    陈外长要求日内瓦会议两主席维护印度支那和平
    制止老挝政府重新燃起战火
    老挝国际监察和监督委员会应立即召开会议恢复活动
    新华社25日讯  中华人民共和国外交部部长陈毅就老挝王国政府向前寮国战斗部队发动武装进攻以及严密监视和软禁老挝爱国党领导人问题，致函关于印度支那问题的日内瓦会议的两位主席苏联外交部长葛罗米柯和英国外交大臣劳埃德，要求苏英两国作为日内瓦会议的参加国，特别是作为会议主席国，立即采取措施制止老挝王国政府违反日内瓦协议的严重行为，并且指示老挝国际委员会立即召开会议，恢复活动。
    中国外交部副部长张闻天和罗贵波于5月25日分别接见了苏联驻中国大使尤金和英国驻中国代办文郁生，向他们递交了陈毅外交部长给日内瓦会议两位主席的信。信的内容如下：
    “我谨提请您注意我在1959年2月19日就老挝王国片面撕毁日内瓦协议问题给您的信。自从那时以来，老挝局势不但丝毫没有好转，而且在继续恶化。最近由于老挝王国政府企图消灭前寮国战斗部队的行为，情况已经变得更加严重。培·萨纳尼空政府全然不顾日内瓦协议和老挝王国政府同前寮国战斗部队在1956年12月和1957年11月达成的各项协议，竟于1959年5月11日下令解除前寮国战斗部队两个营的武装。与此同时，王国政府的军警包围了老挝爱国党和前寮国战斗部队领导人的住宅，将他们置于严密监视和软禁之下。这是对日内瓦协议最严重的违反行为。
    “老挝王国政府现在对老挝爱国党和前寮国战斗部队所采取的措施，是在美国的直接唆使和支持下进行的。这些行为正在把已经熄灭几年的战火重新燃起，严重威胁印度支那的和平，大大加剧了东南亚地区的紧张局势。作为1954年日内瓦会议的参加国和日内瓦协议的保证国之一，中华人民共和国对此自然不能坐视。
    “现在，越南民主共和国外交部长范文同已经正式要求1954年日内瓦会议两主席采取紧急的和有效的措施，以保证关于老挝的日内瓦协议得到尊重和彻底履行。我认为这一要求是完全正当合理的。我同样认为，在这一严重的时刻，作为1954年日内瓦会议的参加国，特别是作为会议主席国，苏联和英国应该立即采取措施制止老挝王国政府这一违反日内瓦协议的严重行为，以维护日内瓦协议和印度支那的和平，并指示老挝国际监察和监督委员会立即召开会议、恢复活动。”
