Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, May 13th: According to today's "Akahata" report, Japanese reactionary forces have established a so-called "National Council on the Tibet Issue" and are scheduled to hold their so-called "National Assembly on the Tibet Issue" in Tokyo on the 14th, in order to orchestrate an anti-China, anti-communist slanderous propaganda campaign.

"Akahata" said that this "Council" is planning to bring Norbu, the Dalai Lama's brother, from the United States to Japan in order to use him to promote their movement hostile to China.

News has it that Norbu, residing in New York, telegraphed the "Council" on the morning of the 13th, saying that he would rush to Japan to participate in the so-called "National Assembly on the Tibet Issue," and then he would go to India to meet with the Dalai Lama.

It is reported that the organizers of this "Council" include Eiichi Amau, a former Ministry of Foreign Affairs official, Tatsuo Mitarai, a political commentator, Kyoshin Kitayake, a Liberal Democratic Party candidate for the House of Councillors, and Masashige Matsushita, president of Rikkyo University. According to Kyodo News, the chairman of the "Council" is Yasaburo Shimonaka.

"Akahata" pointed out that these reactionary elements intend to slander China by using the Tibet issue, which is a new plot by the Kishi Nobusuke government to worsen international relations in the Far East.

    新华社13日讯东京消息：据“赤旗报”今天报道：日本反动势力已经成立了一个所谓“西藏问题国民协议会”。并订于14日在东京举行他们所谓的“西藏问题国民大会”，以便策动一个反华、反共的诽谤性的宣传运动。
      “赤旗报”说，这个“协议会”正在计划把达赖喇嘛的哥哥诺布从美国弄到日本去，以便利用他来推进他们敌视中国的运动。
    有消息说，居住在纽约的诺布已经在13日早上打电报告诉这个“协议会”说，他要赶到日本去参加所谓“西藏问题国民大会”，随后他将到印度去会见达赖喇嘛。
    据报道，组织这个“协议会”的有前外务省官员天羽英一、政治评论员御手洗辰雄、自由民主党的参议员候选人北烟教真和立教大学校长松下正寿等人。据共同社报道，“协议会”的会长是下中弥三郎。
    “赤旗报”指出，这些反动分子打算借西藏问题对中国进行诽谤，这是岸信介政府要使远东的国际关系恶化的新的图谋。
