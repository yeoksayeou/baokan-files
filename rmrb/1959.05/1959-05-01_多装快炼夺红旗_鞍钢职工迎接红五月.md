Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 30th. The hundreds of thousands of iron and steel warriors of Anshan Iron and Steel Company are welcoming Red May by launching a high-production, high-quality Red Flag emulation drive. By the 29th, four large open-hearth furnaces and three large blast furnaces had respectively completed their April production plans ahead of schedule by one to six days.

	In the production battle to welcome Red May, the Anshan Iron and Steel Company's ironmaking, steelmaking, and steel rolling systems launched a contest between factories, furnaces, machines, and individuals. The battle between the ten large blast furnaces of the ironmaking plant was the most intense. On the 21st, the Red Flag furnace – No. 9 blast furnace – was affected in its tapping due to insufficient slag pots and molten iron ladles, and its utilization coefficient fell behind No. 3 blast furnace. On the 22nd, the workers of No. 9 blast furnace, as soon as they started work, went all out, using increased steam volume to compensate for insufficient air volume, increasing the intensity of smelting, and quickly raised the utilization coefficient to 2.284, surpassing No. 3 blast furnace, and continuing to lead the entire plant. On the 24th, the entire plant created the highest daily output record since operations began, with an average utilization coefficient reaching 1.686. The steelmaking experts of the various steelmaking plants launched a steel-grabbing battle of "more charging and faster smelting". On the first day of April, the C shift of No. 16 open-hearth furnace created a new national record for fast steelmaking by producing a heat of steel in five minutes and thirty seconds, firing the first shot, greatly boosting the morale of the steelmaking experts, and reports of fast steelmaking victories continued to pour in. The Youth Solidarity Furnace and the Youth Friendship Furnace competed for the Red Flag in the competition, neither giving way to the other. In the first ten days of April, the average hearth utilization coefficient of the Youth Solidarity Furnace lagged behind that of the Youth Friendship Furnace, but in the middle and last ten days of April, the Youth Solidarity Furnace steadily rose, taking the lead in completing the April plan ahead of schedule.

    多装快炼夺红旗
    鞍钢职工迎接红五月
    据新华社鞍山30日电　鞍山钢铁公司的十几万钢铁战士迎接红五月，展开高产优质红旗竞赛，到29日止，已经有四座大型平炉和三座大型高炉，分别提前一天到六天完成了4月份的生产计划。
    在迎接红五月的生产战斗中，鞍钢的炼铁、炼钢、轧钢系统展开了厂与厂、炉与炉、机与机、人与人的打擂比武。炼铁厂十座大型高炉之间鏖战最为激烈。21日，红旗高炉——九高炉因为渣罐和铁水罐不足，影响了出铁，利用系数落在三高炉后面。22日，九高炉的职工一上班，就鼓足干劲，用增加蒸汽量的办法来弥补风量不足，提高冶炼强度，使利用系数迅速提高到二点二八四，超过了三高炉，继续在全厂领先。24日，全厂创造了开工以来日产量的最高纪录，平均利用系数达到一点六八六。各炼钢厂的炼钢能手们展开“多装快炼”的夺钢大战。十六号平炉丙班工人在4月份第一天创造了五点三十分钟炼一炉钢的全国快速炼钢新纪录，打响了第一炮，大大鼓舞了炼钢能手的干劲，快速炼钢的捷报接连不断出现。青年团结炉与青年友谊炉在竞赛中争夺红旗，互不相让。青年团结炉4月上旬平均炉底利用系数落后于青年友谊炉，中旬和下旬，青年团结炉又步步上升，领先提前完成了4月份计划。
