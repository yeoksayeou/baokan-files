Using Groundwater to Serve Production
Ministry of Agriculture Holds On-site Meeting to Summarize Experiences from Various Regions
Shandong Universally Develops Deep Groundwater to Develop Free-Flowing Irrigation

Jinan, May 7 (Reporter from this newspaper) – Shandong Province has achieved great accomplishments in the development and utilization of groundwater. Now, whether in mountainous areas, hills, or on vast plains, it has developed from the development and utilization of shallow groundwater to the development and utilization of deep groundwater, from non-free-flowing to free-flowing, and from a single engineering form to diverse and comprehensive utilization.

On the basis of the great victory achieved in 1958, Shandong Province's groundwater development and utilization work launched a second high tide of water conservancy construction this spring, mainly involving drilling machine wells, digging spring-fed rivers, storing and conserving water, and extensively building field projects. At present, more than 150,000 ponds, dams, and reservoirs have been completed, 10,000 free-flowing and pumped irrigation canal systems have been built, 85 hydropower stations have been built, and more than 68,000 machine wells of various types have been drilled. Twenty-two counties and cities have successively achieved mechanization of wells. Several major rivers, such as the Yi River and the Shu River, have initially established large-scale basin-wide engineering systems. All kinds of water conservancy projects in the province can control approximately 26 billion cubic meters of water, which can irrigate more than 95 million mu of land, accounting for 73% of the cultivated land area. Soil and water conservation in mountainous areas has reached more than 3,200 square kilometers, accounting for 61% of the area with soil erosion. Although the rainfall in Shandong last year was nearly half less than in previous normal years, the total output of grain, cotton, and peanuts doubled compared to 1957. This spring, the province launched a large-scale spring irrigation campaign, which not only enabled more than 27 million mu of wheat fields to get enough water in time, but also irrigated more than 2 million mu of spring fields with base water.

Shandong has very rich groundwater resources, and the people of Shandong have also fully utilized their wisdom and talents in developing groundwater. They put forward the battle cry of "getting power and wealth from groundwater." They have accumulated a lot of experience in the methods of developing and utilizing groundwater. Using these experiences, groundwater not only irrigates farmland, but also serves the overall development of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fishery. Yishui County in the Yimeng Mountain area has accumulated more than 35 million cubic meters of groundwater by drilling deep wells and machine wells, digging pits, ponds, and reservoirs, building river dams, and intercepting shallow flows. The combination of groundwater and surface water has irrigated 950,000 mu of land. The county also uses free-flowing water as power, saving 1.5 million labor days a year. Pingdu County, a semi-mountainous and semi-plain area, has expanded its irrigated area from 530,000 mu in 1957 to 2.1 million mu in 1958 by digging mountain springs and drilling deep wells.

According to the requirements of the great leap forward in agricultural production, Shandong Province plans to expand the irrigated area by 34 million mu this year and basically complete soil and water conservation work in mountainous and hilly areas. At present, it is actively and systematically summarizing irrigation management experience and solving practical problems in irrigation, so that groundwater can play a greater role in this year's continued great leap forward.

Jinan, May 7 (Reporter from this newspaper) – The Ministry of Agriculture recently held an on-site meeting on the utilization and development of groundwater in Gaotang and Pingdu, Shandong, attended by representatives from 19 provinces, cities, and autonomous regions, to summarize and promote the experience of utilizing groundwater. The meeting believed that China's work in developing and utilizing groundwater in 1958 achieved great accomplishments: a total of more than 3 million various water wells (including 380,000 machine wells) were drilled across the country, developing a flow rate of 1,000 cubic meters per second of underground free-flowing water. By the end of last year, the irrigated area using groundwater in the country reached more than 200 million mu, equivalent to 18 times the area irrigated by wells before liberation. Last year, many areas from the south to the north of our country experienced severe drought, and some areas in Hebei, Shandong, Jilin, Liaoning, and other provinces had not had a thorough rain for two to three hundred days. Groundwater water conservancy projects effectively resisted the threat of drought and ensured a great agricultural harvest.

The meeting summarized the basic experience of various regions in utilizing and developing groundwater as "deep, flow, storage, many, combination, and management." "Deep" refers to drilling machine wells and deep wells to fully utilize deep groundwater; "Flow" refers to utilizing underground confined water and topographic slope to transform groundwater into free-flowing water, developing free-flowing irrigation, and using water energy to build hydro stations and power stations; "Storage" refers to controlling free-flowing water and accumulating groundwater to increase water sources and shorten the irrigation cycle; "Many" refers to developing underground water sources in various ways according to local conditions, in order to achieve the purpose of irrigating more land and increasing production; "Combination" refers to rational utilization and comprehensive utilization, serving a variety of economies such as agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, and fishery; "Management" refers to doing a good job in project management and irrigation management to give full play to project benefits.

The meeting called for another great leap forward in the national groundwater utilization and development work this year. All regions should actively realize mechanization of wells according to needs and possibilities, and build machine well reservoirs. Counties with free-flowing groundwater conditions should strive to develop more than five to ten cubic meters per second of water volume this year, and initially ascertain the reserves and distribution of groundwater.

　　利用地下水为生产服务
    农业部召开现场会议总结各地经验
    山东普遍开发深层水发展自流灌溉
    本报济南7日讯　山东省开发利用地下水的工作有很大成就。现在，无论是在山区、丘陵或者在广大平原上，都已经从开发利用地下浅层水发展到开发利用地下深层水，从不自流达到自流，从单一的工程形式发展到多种多样的综合利用。
    山东省地下水的开发利用工作，在1958年取得巨大胜利的基础上，今春又开展了一个以打机井、挖泉组河、蓄水保水、广泛兴修田间工程为主要内容的第二个水利建设高潮。目前已完成塘、坝、水库十五万多座，兴修自流，扬水渠系灌溉工程一万处，水电站八十五处，打各种类型的机井六万八千多眼，有二十二个县市先后达到机井化。有几条主要河流，如沂水、沭河等，已初步建立了大流域性的工程系统。全省各种水利工程，大约可控制水量二百六十亿公方，可以灌溉九千五百多万亩地，占耕地面积73％；山区水土保持已达到三千二百多平方公里，占水土流失面积的61％。去年山东比以往常年同期降雨量虽然减少将近一半，但粮、棉、花生总产量都比1957年翻了一番。今春全省开展了规模巨大的春灌运动，不仅使二千七百多万亩麦田及时喝足了水；同时又为二百多万亩春田灌了底水。
    山东的地下水源非常丰富，山东人民在开发地下水方面，也充分发挥了他们的智慧与才能。他们提出“向地下水要动力，要财富”的战斗口号。在开发利用地下水的方法上，他们积累了很多经验。运用这些经验，使地下水不仅灌溉农田，而且为农、林、牧、副、渔全面大发展服务。沂蒙山区的沂水县通过打深井、机井，挖坑、塘、水库，打拦河坝，截浅流等办法，共蓄积地下水三千五百多公方，地下水与地面水结合起来，灌溉了九十五万亩地。全县并利用自流水作动力，一年可节约一百五十万个劳动日。半山半平原的平度县通过挖山泉、打深井等办法，使灌溉面积由1957年的五十三万亩，扩大到1958年的二百一十万亩。
    山东省根据农业生产大跃进的要求，今年计划扩大灌溉面积三千四百万亩，基本完成山区丘陵地带水土保持工作。目前正在积极系统地总结灌溉管理经验，解决灌溉中的实际问题，使地下水在今年的继续大跃进中发挥更大的效能。

    本报济南7日电　农业部最近在山东高唐和平度召开了十九省市自治区利用开发地下水的现场会议，总结推广利用地下水的经验。会议认为，1958年我国开发利用地下水工作，取得了巨大成就：全国共打各种水井三百多万眼（其中机井三十八万眼），开发地下自流水一千秒公方的流量；到去年底，全国利用地下水灌溉面积达两亿多亩，相当于解放前井灌面积的十八倍。我国去年从南到北，曾有不少地区发生严重旱象，河北、山东、吉林、辽宁等省有些地区二三百天没有下过透雨，地下水水利工程有力地抗御了干旱威胁，保证了农业大丰收。
    会议总结了各地利用开发地下水的基本经验是“深、流、蓄、多、合、管”。“深”，是打机井、打深井，充分利用深层地下水；“流”，是利用地下承压水和地形坡度，变地下水为自流水，发展自流灌溉，并利用水能修建水力站、电力站；“蓄”，是把自流水控制起来，把地下水积蓄起来，以增加水源，缩短轮灌时间；“多”，是因地制宜，多种多样开发地下水源，以便达到多浇地、多增产的目的；“合”，是合理利用、综合利用，为农、林、牧、副、渔多种经济服务；“管”，是作好工程管理和灌溉管理工作，充分发挥工程效益。
    会议要求今年全国地下水利用开发工作再来个大跃进。各地应根据需要和可能积极实现机井化，修建机井水库。地下水有自流条件的县，要争取在今年开发五个到十个以上秒公方水量，并初步摸清地下水储量和分布情况。
