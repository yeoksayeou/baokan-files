    To Struggle Against Disaster is Victory
    Friendship Team in Shanghai Wins a Great Battle in a Storm, While Hua Yi Team Loses Without a Fight
    Farmers in Jianghan Plain Brave Wind and Rain to Rush Plant and Protect Seedlings, Completing Cotton Planting on Time
    This newspaper reports: In the suburbs of Shanghai, the "July 1st" Commune, two production teams adopted different attitudes during a rainstorm, resulting in different outcomes. On April 11th, Shanghai experienced an unexpected level 10 gale and rainstorm. The wind and rain lasted from morning until night, and crops such as wheat and rapeseed in the suburbs were blown down, and the fields were flooded.
    When the wind and rain arrived, the cadres of the Friendship Production Team of the "July 1st" Commune in the suburbs immediately divided their labor after discovering the situation in the morning. They held emergency meetings in each team, mobilizing the masses to rescue the crops. Everyone believed that the wheat, rapeseed, broad beans, and other crops were growing well and a good harvest was in sight. If they didn't rescue them in time, the fruits within reach would be wasted. So, they immediately took action, carrying hoes, barefoot, braving the rain to dredge ditches and drain water in the fields. Some covered vegetable seedlings with straw, and some reinforced pig sheds with wooden stakes and ropes. That evening, Party members and members of the Communist Youth League held a meeting to study measures for rescuing crops, ensuring that not a single seedling or vegetable was lost.
    The next day, the wind and rain stopped, and the soil in the fields was still very wet. Usually, under such circumstances, no work would be done. But on this day, all commune members who could participate in production went to the fields to work. They re-erected the pea trellises that had been blown down and surrounded the rapeseed with ropes. On the 13th, when the weather cleared and the fields dried, the commune members intensified their efforts to loosen the soil, replant, fertilize, and spray pesticide powder to promote rapid crop recovery.
    In the same commune, when the wind and rain suddenly struck the Hua Yi Production Team, some cadres believed that the crops had already been blown down, and the wind and rain were so heavy that rescue would be useless. Therefore, they did not seriously mobilize the commune members to prevent wind and rain (only a few people came out to dredge ditches and drain water). After the rain stopped and the wind subsided, they felt that the fields were too wet and the roads were too slippery to work, so they did not organize the commune members to rescue the crops in time after the disaster.
    The different attitudes taken by these two production teams towards wind and rain disasters led to different results. The wheat, rapeseed, broad beans, peas, and other crops of the Friendship Production Team soon raised their heads after the wind and rain. Fewer pea and broad bean flowers fell, and the kidney bean and pumpkin seedlings grew new, tender green leaves. Tomatoes have also blossomed with yellow flowers. It is estimated that general crops can complete the original production targets. Due to slow action and insufficient rescue efforts, the Hua Yi Production Team lost sixty to seventy pieces of glass from the seedling sheds due to the wind, more broad bean and pea flowers fell, and the fallen wheat and rapeseed crops raised their heads later. It is estimated that wheat production will be reduced by half, rapeseed production will be reduced by 20%, and some cucumber seedlings will also be lost.

    This newspaper reports from Wuhan on the 4th: The vast number of farmers in the cotton-producing areas of the Jianghan Plain in Hubei Province have planted more than 4 million mu of cotton while braving wind and rain.
    In the first half of April, just as the comprehensive planting of cotton was underway in the Jianghan Plain, it suffered three heavy rains in a row. In order to plant in time and not miss the agricultural season, the farmers braved the wind and rain to carry out a struggle to rush planting and protect the seedlings. They concentrated their efforts on draining waterlogging during the rain, and when the rain stopped and the weather cleared, they launched a massive planting campaign, completing the planting task on schedule. Recently, when reporters traveled along the Han (kou) Yi (chang) highway through the Jianghan Plain, they saw busy crowds everywhere, carefully loosening the soil for the rain-soaked cotton fields, or clearing ditches. Cotton fields with missing seedlings due to rain damage were replanted as soon as possible. The Party branch of the Luoji Management Area of the Guikou Commune in Zhongxiang County found that more than 7,000 mu of cotton fields had suffered from soil compaction after planting due to heavy rain when cotton planting was basically completed. It immediately mobilized commune members to rush-produce more than 4,000 soil-loosening rakes in two days and universally loosened the compacted cotton fields once. More than 5,000 mu of cotton seedlings had symptoms of disease and were promptly sprayed with Bordeaux mixture for prevention and treatment. At that time, the weather was unpredictable with alternating cloudy and rainy conditions, so they mobilized commune members to accumulate ash in every household to prevent frost and keep the cotton seedlings warm. After several heavy rains, the groundwater level in some low-lying cotton fields continued to rise. In addition to organizing a large number of people to clear ditches and drain waterlogging, the entire management area dug more than 10,000 water storage ponds on the edges of more than 20,000 mu of low-lying cotton fields, which quickly lowered the groundwater level.
    In order to ensure that the cotton seedlings survive and grow strong after the rain, various places are rushing to produce cotton nutrient pots and nutrient blocks in large quantities in preparation for replanting. The nutrient pots planned to be made in Jingzhou Prefecture alone this year can be used to transplant 570,000 mu of cotton fields. Commune members said that this is "double insurance" to ensure full survival and strong seedlings.
    In order to prevent the attack of natural disasters, many communes have ensured that each cotton field has a dedicated person to manage it, and each plot has management measures. Once a major disaster occurs, there is responsibility at every level and responsibility for everyone. Responsibilities are clear and order is maintained to overcome the disaster.

    向灾害斗争就是胜利
    在上海暴风雨中友谊队大战而胜，华一队不战而败
    江汉平原农民冒风雨抢种护苗，及时种完棉花
    本报讯　上海市郊“七一”公社，有二个生产队在暴风雨袭击时，采取不同态度，得到不同的效果。4月11日，上海市出现了人们意料不到的十级大风和暴雨，风雨从早延续到夜里，郊区的麦子、油菜等作物，被暴风雨刮倒，田野一片积水。
    风雨来临时，市郊“七一”公社友谊生产队的干部们，在早上发现这一情况后，就立即分工到各小队召开紧急会议，动员群众抢救。大家认为，目前小麦、油菜、蚕豆等作物都长得很好，丰收在望，如不及时抢救，眼看到手的果实就要白白糟蹋。于是就立即行动，背着锄头，赤着脚，冒雨在田间开沟排水，有的用稻草复盖蔬菜秧苗，有的打木桩用绳子加固猪棚。当天晚间，党团员们又开会研究抢救作物的措施，保证不损失一棵苗，一棵菜。
    第二天，风雨停了，田里土壤仍然很潮湿，往常这种情况是不出工的。但这一天，所有能参加生产的社员，都下田干活，他们把被风刮倒的豌豆棚重新扶起，油菜也用绳子围起来。13日，天晴田干，社员们又加紧进行松土、补种、施肥、喷药粉等工作，促使作物迅速恢复生长。
    在同一个公社里，华一生产队在暴风雨突然袭击时，有些干部认为作物已被吹倒，风雨又这么大，抢救也没有用，因此，就没有认真动员社员防风雨（只有少数人出来开沟排水）；雨停风止以后，他们又认为田里太湿，路又滑，不好出工，因此没有组织社员在灾后及时地抢救。
    这两个生产队对待风雨灾害采取不同态度，得到了不同的效果。友谊生产队的小麦、油菜、蚕豆、豌豆等在暴风雨后不久都抬起了头，豌豆、蚕豆的花朵落得较少，刀豆、南瓜等秧苗都重新长出嫩绿的新叶，番茄也已开出了黄花，据估计，一般作物都可以完成原订的产量指标。华一生产队，由于行动迟缓，抢救不力，育苗棚上的玻璃被风吹落碎六、七十块，蚕豆、豌豆花朵落得较多，倒伏的小麦、油菜等抬头也较迟。据估计，麦子要减产一半，油菜减产二成，黄瓜秧苗也损失了一部分。

    本报武汉4日电　湖北江汉平原棉产区的广大农民，冒着风雨播种了四百多万亩棉花。
    4月上半月，正当江汉平原棉花全面播种的时候，曾连遭三次大雨。农民们为了及时播种、不误农时，冒着风雨进行了抢种和护苗的斗争。他们在下雨时集中力量排除渍水，雨住天晴就千军万马突击播种，按期完成了播种任务。最近，记者乘车由汉（口）宜（昌）公路穿过江汉平原时，沿路到处是忙碌的人群，他们正在细心地为久雨的棉田疏松土壤，或整理沟渠，遭雨害而缺苗的棉田也及早进行了补种。锺祥县归口公社罗集管理区的党总支在棉花播种基本结束时，发现有七千多亩棉田播种后遭大雨，发生了土地板结现象，马上发动社员在两天内赶制了四千多个松土耙子，把板结的棉田普遍松土一次；五千多亩棉苗有病害现象，也及时喷射了波尔多液进行防治；当时的天气阴雨变幻无常，他们便发动社员们家家户户积火灰，为棉苗防冻保温；有些低洼棉田经过几场大雨后地下水位不断升高，全管理区除了组织大批人力抓紧清沟排渍外，又在两万多亩低洼棉田的田边地角挖了一万多口蓄水垱，使地下水位迅速降低。
    为了确保棉花在遭雨后全苗、壮苗，各地正在大量赶制棉花营养钵和营养块，准备补植。仅荆州专区今年计划作的营养钵，就可以移植五十七万亩棉田。社员们说，这是确保全苗、壮苗的“双保险”。
    为了防止自然灾害的袭击，许多公社的棉田做到了块块有专人管理，丘丘有管理措施。一旦遇到重大灾害时，层层有责，人人有责，职责分明，秩序井然地去战胜灾害。
