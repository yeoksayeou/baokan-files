　　Scientifically and Meticulously Conduct Early Rice Field Management Work
    Cangwu Establishes Agricultural Condition Inspection and Reporting Network
    Levels Responsible, Every Field Specially Managed, Situation Reflected Promptly, Problems Solved Quickly
    Our newspaper's Nanning dispatch on the 7th: Cangwu County, Guangxi, has established a complete agricultural condition inspection and reporting network, conducting field management scientifically and thoughtfully to ensure the implementation of high-yield plans.
    The agricultural condition inspection and reporting network in Cangwu County was established based on summarizing last year's production technology experience and considering this year's production characteristics. Last year's field management lacked specific organizational measures, and some emerging widespread problems were not prevented in time, which affected production. Therefore, this year, from the beginning of field management, an organization and system for agricultural condition inspection and reporting were established, making field management work more and more meticulous, allowing leading cadres to understand the situation below in a timely manner and make decisive decisions.
    The agricultural condition inspection and reporting network is distributed throughout the county. Communes have agricultural condition inspection and reporting networks, brigades have stations, production teams have groups, and each work group has a full-time inspector. Most of them are experienced farmers and technicians. The Cangwu County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has a person responsible for leading the agricultural condition inspection and reporting network, ensuring that each level has someone responsible and each field is specially managed. They care for the seedlings as carefully and patiently as nurses, reporting problems immediately and solving them at any time. In the past half-month, based on soil and seedling growth conditions, they have adopted a prevention-oriented approach, and field management work has been done very well. Some newly emerging problems, such as water, insects, and diseases, have been prevented and eliminated in time. Huang Yaoguang, an inspector of the Xinfu Production Team, discovered rice blast in Gufangdong and immediately reported it to the production team leader. The production team reported to the brigade, and the news quickly reached the county committee. The county committee immediately notified all parts of the county to conduct inspections. At the same time, each commune also held forums for experienced farmers and technicians, researched seven kinds of folk prevention methods, and after promotion, within a few days, more than two thousand mu of rice fields in the county with rice blast were basically turned green.
    After the establishment of the agricultural condition inspection and reporting network, the production experience and work enthusiasm of experienced farmers and technicians have been fully utilized. Many active and responsible inspectors have emerged throughout the county. Pan Jiongchen of the Seventh Production Team of the Diancun Brigade of the Xindi Commune is in charge of 157 mu of fields. To make these seedlings grow more vigorously, this old farmer inspects the fields several times a day. He knows exactly which field ridges need to be repaired, which fields should be drained, and which should be irrigated. Once, he saw that several fields by the roadside had been trampled by livestock, and immediately called several commune members to weave fences together to enclose them. He found a small patch of Imperata cylindrica growing in Dadi Dong, and was shocked, thinking: Don't let this thing absorb the fertilizer and water. He quickly went down to the field and patiently pulled them out one by one. After pulling for a long time, he made sure that not a single one was left before he walked away with peace of mind. This year, many plots have been deeply ploughed, and the fertilizer is sufficient, so the seedlings turn green as soon as they are transplanted and grow very quickly, but because of insufficient phosphorus and potassium fertilizer, some rice has shown signs of lodging. However, the seedlings managed by Pan Jiongchen are growing very robustly, with no signs of lodging. This is mainly due to good management. In addition to topdressing with phosphorus and potassium fertilizer, an important aspect is scientific irrigation and drainage. He divides the fields in the seven dongs he manages into two categories. For fields with good soil quality and sufficient water sources, he adopts the method of draining and sun-drying the fields. The fields are irrigated for one day and drained for three days. After the soil is exposed to the sun, the topsoil becomes dry and hard, and the rice roots penetrate deeper, making the foundation solid. The rice stalks are not often soaked in water, so they are also hard and strong. Another type is sandy soil fields with insufficient water sources, which are not suitable for draining, so shallow irrigation is implemented, with a maximum of three points, so that the fields are neither short of water nor do the rice stalks get excessively soaked. Therefore, when their team conducts irrigation and drainage inspections, everyone praises him for his meticulous work and achievements, inserts seven red flags in his seven dongs, and evaluates him as an excellent inspector.

　　科学地细致地进行早稻田间管理工作
    苍梧建立农情检查报告网
    层层有人负责　田田有人专管　情况及时反映　问题迅速解决
    本报南宁7日电　广西苍梧县建立了一套完整的农情检查报告网，科学而周到地进行田间管理，保证丰产计划落实。
    苍梧县的农情检查报告网，是在总结去年生产技术经验和考虑今年生产特点的基础上建立的。去年的田间管理由于缺乏一套具体的组织措施，对一些刚出现的带有普遍性的问题，没有及时防止，生产受到一些影响。因此今年在田间管理一开始，就建立了一套农情检查报告的组织和制度，使田间管理工作越作越细致；使领导干部及时了解下情，当机立断。
    农情检查报告网分布全县，公社有农情检查报告网，大队设站，生产队设组，各个作业小组设有专职检查员。他们大都是老农和技术员。中共苍梧县委有专人负责对农情检查报告网的领导，做到层层有人负责，田田有人专管。他们像护士一样细心、耐心地护理禾苗，发现问题立即报告，随时解决。半个月来，他们根据土壤和禾苗生长情况，采取防重于治的方针，田间管理工作做的很好。一些刚露头的问题，如水、虫、病等都及时被防止和扑灭。新富生产队检查员黄耀光在古房垌发现了稻热病，立即向生产队长报告，生产队向大队报告，消息很快就传到县委。县委马上通知全县各地进行检查，同时各公社也召开了老农、技术员座谈会，研究出七种防治的土办法，推广后，几天工夫全县两千多亩发生稻热病的禾田都基本转青了。
    农情检查报告网建立后，老农和技术员的生产经验和工作积极性，得到了充分的发挥。全县涌现出很多积极负责的检查员。新地公社殿村大队第七生产队的潘炯臣看管了一百五十七亩田。为使这些禾苗愈长愈旺，这个老农每天都要在田里巡视好几遍，哪一条田基要修要补，哪一块田该排该灌，他都心中有数。有一次他看到几块路边田被家畜踏坏了，立刻招呼几个社员，一起动手编织篱笆围起来。他在大地垌发现一小块田长了标茅，心里一怔，想道：可别叫这东西把肥料、水分吸去了，赶紧下田，一根一根耐心地拔。拔了半天，看看确是一根也不剩了，才放心走开。今年很多地块都经过深耕，肥料又充足，禾苗插下马上转青，长得特别快，但因磷钾肥不够，有的水稻已呈现倒伏现象。可是潘炯臣所管的禾苗却长得很茁壮，没有一点倒伏的迹象。这主要是因为管理得好。他除了追施磷钾肥外，重要的一环在于科学的排灌。他把自己管理的七个垌的田分为两类，对于土质好、水源充足的田，采取排干晒田的办法，灌一天排干三天田经太阳一晒，表土变干硬，禾根就往深处扎，根底就扎实了。禾秆不常泡在水里，也就硬壮了。另有一种是水源不足的沙质土田，不宜于排干，就实行浅灌，最多三分，使田里既不缺水也不至于使禾秆浸水过分。因此，他们队进行排灌检查时，大家称赞他工作细致，有成绩，给他那七个垌插上七面红旗，评他为优秀检查员。　（施峥尧）
