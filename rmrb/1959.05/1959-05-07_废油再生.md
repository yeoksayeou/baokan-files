Waste Oil Regeneration

Lubricating oil is an indispensable oil for modern machinery. Without it, machines cannot operate, airplanes, ships, and trains cannot move, and even sewing machines and clocks in people's daily lives cannot be used.

Lubricating oil is a high-grade oil product, and its price is much higher than gasoline and diesel. If a car travels 100,000 kilometers a year, it consumes at least 1,000 kilograms of lubricating oil, worth about 1,200 yuan.

During the operation of various machines, lubricating oil, apart from burning or scattering a portion under high speed, high temperature, and high pressure, is generally contaminated by water, dust, sand, and metal filings, or due to prolonged use, harmful substances such as carbon residue, asphalt, colloids, and acids are produced in the oil, making it unusable. Therefore, new lubricating oil must be replaced after a certain period. This replaced oil is called waste oil.

Generally, waste oil can be turned back into good oil through mechanical filtration or chemical treatment. This process is called regeneration. The amount of waste oil regenerated varies in different departments. Generally, machine oil and turbine oil can reach 80%; transformer oil reaches 90%, and automobile and tractor oil is relatively less, but it is also 60%. Cutting iron filings in machine factories and recycled silk in textile factories contain waste lubricating oil. Even the wiping cloths and gloves used by workers, due to frequent contact with machines, also absorb a portion of oil. Good oil can be extracted from them by boiling them in alkaline water or using pressing methods.

The method of recovering waste oil is not difficult. Installing a tray under the machine, attaching an oil guide pipe, or installing an oil scraper can avoid the loss of waste oil. Different types of waste oil should not be placed in the same container, especially animal and vegetable oils, which should be stored separately to improve the regeneration rate and quality of regeneration.

Waste oil regeneration is a major link in saving lubricating oil. In 1958, Shanghai sold 20,000 tons of lubricating oil. Through waste oil recovery, 4,200 tons of good oil were produced, worth 4.2 million yuan.

### 废油再生

    废油再生
    润滑油是近代机械工具必不可少的油料。没有它，机器不能运转，飞机、轮船、火车不能开动，就连人们日常生活中的缝纫机、钟表也无法使用。
    润滑油在石油产品中是高级油料，价格比汽油、柴油高得多。一辆汽车如果每年行驶十万公里，至少消耗润滑油一千公斤，价值一千二百元左右。
    润滑油在各种机械运转过程中，除了在高速、高温、高压的情况下燃烧或飞散一部分外，一般都是由于遇到水份、灰尘、砂粒、金属屑末被弄脏，或因时间过长，油内产生碳渣、沥青、胶质、酸类等有害物质而不能继续使用，因此经过一定时期必须更换新的润滑油。这种换下来的油就叫做废油。
    一般的废油经过机械滤清或化学处理，可以重新变成好油，这个过程叫做再生。不同部门的废油再生量也有不同。一般机械油和透平（汽轮机）油可达百分之八十；变压器油达到百分之九十，汽车和拖拉机油比较少，但是也有百分之六十。机械工厂里的切削铁屑、纺织工厂里的回丝都会有废润滑油，甚至工人们使用的拭布、手套，由于经常同机器接触，也吸收了一部分油，放在碱水里煮或用压榨办法，也能从中提出好油。
    回收废油的办法并不困难，在机器下面装个托盘，接根导油管或者安个油刮子，就能避免废油的流失。不同品种的废油不能放在一个盛器里，特别是动、植物油要分别存放，可以提高废油的再生率和再生的品质。
    废油再生是节约润滑油的一个主要环节。一九五八年，上海市销售润滑油二万吨，通过废油回收，制成的好油有四千二百吨，价值四百二十万元。
