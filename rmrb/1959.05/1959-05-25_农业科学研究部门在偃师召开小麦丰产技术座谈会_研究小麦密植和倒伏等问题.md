Agricultural Science Research Department Holds Wheat High-Yield Technology Symposium in Yanshi
    Research on Wheat Close Planting and Lodging Problems

    (Reported by our newspaper) The Crop Breeding and Cultivation Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, together with the Henan Provincial Agricultural Science Research Institute, held a Northern Wheat High-Yield Technology Symposium in Yanshi County, Henan Province, from May 7th to 13th. The meeting exchanged information and experience on the high-yield and scientific research of wheat in northern regions this year, visited the 10,000-mu high-yield demonstration plots in Laocheng Commune and Zhai Town Commune in Yanshi County, and discussed three aspects: reasonable close planting, prevention of lodging, and harvesting and threshing.

    According to the data gathered at the meeting, the sowing amount of wheat in the fields of northern regions this year has increased by about one time compared with 1958, and the number of ears has also greatly increased compared with last year. The meeting affirmed that the sowing density of most wheat fields this year is within the scope of reasonable close planting. On the basis of more wheat seedlings than in previous years, the comprehensive yield increase effect centered on close planting, while improving fertilizer and water conditions and cultivation management levels, has been brought into play.

    After detailed discussions on the issue of wheat close planting at the meeting (the results of the discussion are published in a special article on this page today), the issue of wheat lodging was also discussed. This year, the vast majority of large-area high-yield fields and ordinary fields are growing normally, with only some high-yield experimental fields and a small number of large-area high-yield fields experiencing spotty lodging. Analyzing the reasons, it was unanimously agreed that there are many factors causing wheat lodging. Generally speaking, lodging is closely related to soil, fertilizer, water, seeds, density, and field management. Among them, excessive nitrogen fertilizer, improper irrigation, and poor management are the main causes of lodging. Variety characteristics, excessively high seeding rates in individual high-yield experimental fields and untimely sowing, as well as changes in climatic conditions, especially the invasion of strong winds and rainstorms, can all significantly affect the occurrence and degree of lodging. Due to the comprehensive and complex nature of the factors causing lodging, in order to prevent lodging, comprehensive measures must be taken from the outset, consistently implementing the principle of prevention first from sowing to harvest. For wheat fields with a tendency to lodge, all remedial measures should also be actively taken to reduce and avoid lodging losses.

    The meeting also discussed the issue of harvesting and threshing. Everyone believed that this year's wheat has a high density and many ears, making the harvesting task heavy. In particular, the simultaneous harvesting and sowing of summer crops makes the situation extraordinarily arduous, and improper arrangements can easily lead to neglecting one task at the expense of another. Therefore, it is necessary to closely arrange agricultural work, improve harvesting and threshing, and improve transportation tools to improve harvesting and threshing efficiency. In addition, harvesting should be appropriately advanced according to the characteristics of the varieties to reduce losses from grain shedding and mildew.

    农业科学研究部门在偃师召开小麦丰产技术座谈会
    研究小麦密植和倒伏等问题
    本报讯　中国农业科学院作物育种栽培研究所会同河南省农业科学研究所于5月7日到13日，在河南省偃师县召开了北方小麦丰产技术座谈会。会议交流了今年北方小麦丰产和科学研究的情况和经验，参观了偃师县老城公社和翟镇公社万亩丰产方，并对合理密植、防止倒伏、收获脱粒三个方面进行了讨论。
    根据会上所掌握的资料，今年北方各地小麦大田的播种量比1958年提高了一倍左右，穗数也比去年大大增加，会上肯定了今年大多数麦田的播种密度是在合理密植范围之内，在麦苗比往年为多的基础上发挥了以密植为中心，同时提高肥水条件和耕作管理水平的综合增产作用。
    会议在对小麦密植问题进行详细的讨论以后（讨论结果见今天本版发表的专文），又讨论了小麦倒伏问题。今年绝大多数的大面积丰产田和大田生长正常，只部分高产试验田和少数大面积丰产田发生点片倒伏，分析原因，一致认为引起小麦倒伏的因素很多，一般说倒伏和土、肥、水、种、密以及田间管理，都有密切关系，其中以氮肥过多、浇水不当和管理不善是引起倒伏的主要原因，品种特性、个别高产试验田的播种量过高和播种失时，以及气候条件的变化特别是大风暴雨的侵袭等等都能明显地影响倒伏的发生和倒伏的程度。由于造成倒伏因素的综合性和复杂性，为了防止倒伏必须从基本上采取综合措施，从种到收始终如一地贯彻以防为主的方针。对于有倒伏趋势的麦田也应积极采取一切挽救措施，减免倒伏损失。
    会议还讨论了收获脱粒问题。大家认为：今年小麦密度大、穗子多，收割任务大，特别是夏收、夏种同时进行，更显得异常繁重，安排不当很容易顾此失彼。因此，必须紧密地安排农活、改进收割和脱粒、运输工具，提高收获脱粒效率，并且根据品种特性适当提早收割，减少落粒、霉烂的损失。
