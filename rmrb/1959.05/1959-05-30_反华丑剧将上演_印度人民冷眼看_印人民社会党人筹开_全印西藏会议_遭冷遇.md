Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, May 29th. Some leading figures of the Indian People's Socialist Party have gathered a group of reactionary elements in Calcutta in recent days, attempting to create a false impression for an anti-China farce, the "All-India Tibet Conference," scheduled to be staged on the 30th. However, they have been met with indifference by the local people.

According to newspaper reports, the organizers of the conference will gather some reactionary elements from India and other Asian countries to use the Tibetan rebellion as a pretext to make anti-China and anti-communist clamors, namely, to discuss the problems caused by the so-called "national rebellion" in Tibet. Before this conference, the People's Socialist Party organized some so-called regional conferences to stir up trouble. At one such meeting held on the 26th at the People's Socialist Party office in Howrah, the most densely populated area near Calcutta, the speaker frantically made anti-China and anti-communist noises for forty-five minutes, but according to Calcutta's "Liberty," only twelve people attended the meeting. At a similar meeting held in the Kanchrapara area near Calcutta, there were more organizers than audience members.

On the 27th, the organizers of the "All-India Tibet Conference" also held a so-called "Youth Day" as a prelude to the conference. The chairman of the preparatory committee, a self-proclaimed "historian" named Majumdar, shouted at a gathering at the University of Calcutta to "strengthen the Tibetan liberation struggle on Indian soil." The meeting passed an extremely absurd resolution, demanding that the Chinese army withdraw from Tibet, Chinese territory. However, most of the four hundred participants in this "Youth Day" were not ordinary youth, but members of the People's Socialist Party. The thirty thousand youths of Calcutta, however, expressed their true will at a grand get-together held from the 16th to the 24th, where they shouted slogans such as "Long live Sino-Indian friendship" and "Long live Asian-African solidarity," and firmly stated that they would not interfere in Tibetan affairs, which are China's internal affairs.

The long-planned "All-India Tibet Conference" will be staged on the 30th. In the list of prominent participants announced by the preparatory committee, the names of former Congress Party President Debar, Congress Party President Indira Gandhi, and General Secretary Kripalani have been temporarily crossed out. Former People's Socialist Party Chairman Gan. Xia. Xin Ge and People's Socialist Party leader Narayan will preside over the meeting. The participants will include: People's Socialist Party leader Kripalani, Indian People's Alliance Chairman Ghosh, former Chief Minister of Travancore-Cochin State (now part of Kerala State), People's Socialist Party leader P. Da. Pillai, and the editor of the "Indian Express," Maurice (according to newspaper reports, "his connection with a certain foreign embassy is well-known"), and others. They have invited groups from some Asian and African countries and Yugoslavia to send representatives to participate in this "All-India Tibet Conference."

Shortly after the announcement that the conference would be held, the United States Information Service deliberately issued a message saying that the conference would "put forward ways for India to help restore Tibet's self-determination," and so on.

    反华丑剧将上演　印度人民冷眼看
    印人民社会党人筹开“全印西藏会议”遭冷遇
    新华社新德里29日电　印度人民社会党的一些首脑人物纠集了一批反动分子，连日来在加尔各答进行活动，企图为预定在30日上演的一幕反对中国的丑剧“全印西藏会议”虚张声势。但却遭到了当地人民的冷遇。
    据报纸报道，会议的组织者将张罗一些印度和其它亚洲国家中的一些反动分子，在这个会上利用西藏叛乱事件作反华反共叫嚣，即讨论所谓西藏“民族叛乱”所引起的问题。在这次会议召开以前，人民社会党就搞了一些所谓地区性会议来煽风点火。26日，在加尔各答附近人口最稠密的豪拉地区人民社会党办事处举行的一次这样的会议上，发言者声嘶力竭地作了四十五分钟的反华反共叫嚣，但是据加尔各答“自由报”报道，参加这次会议的人一共只有十二名。而在加尔各答附近的坎奇腊帕腊区举行的一个同类的会议上，组织会议的人比听众的人数还要多。
    27日，“全印西藏会议”的组织者又搞了一个所谓“青年日”，作为会议前奏。会议的筹备委员会主席、号称“历史学家”的马朱达在加尔各答大学举行的一次集会上叫喊“在印度的土地上加强西藏的解放斗争”。会上通过一项极为荒诞的决议，竟然要中国军队撤出中国的领土西藏。但在这个“青年日”的四百个参加者之中，大部分不是普通青年，而是人民社会党的党员。而加尔各答的三万青年却在16日到24日举行的盛大的联欢节中表示了他们真正的意志，他们在这次活动中高呼“印中友好万岁”和“亚非团结万岁”等口号，并且坚决表示不干涉属于中国内政的西藏事务。
    这个筹备已久的“全印西藏会议”将在30日上演。在筹备委员会公布的有名望的参加者的名单中，前国大党主席德巴、国大党主席甘地夫人和总书记克里帕拉尼夫人的名字都临时勾销了。前人民社会党主席甘·夏·辛格、人民社会党领袖纳拉扬将主持会议。参加会议的将有：人民社会党领袖克里帕拉尼、印度人民同盟主席高希、前特特凡哥尔—柯钦邦（现已成为喀拉拉邦的一部分）首席部长、人民社会党领袖帕·答·皮莱和“印度快报”的主编莫雷斯（据报纸报道，“他同某一个外国大使馆的联系是有名的”）等。他们已经邀请一些亚非国家的团体和南斯拉夫派代表参加这次“全印西藏会议”。
    在这次会议宣布将要召开以后不久，美国新闻处就特意为它发了消息，说这次会议将“提出印度帮助恢复西藏自决权”等办法。
