    Wangzhuang Production Team of Hongqi People's Commune and Liwan Production Team of Weixing People's Commune are close neighbors.

    Wangzhuang Production Team has excellent manpower and animal power, but poor water conservancy conditions. Just after the Spring Festival, Wang Erhui, the Party Branch Secretary, led a group of people managing the wheat fields, repaired the wells early, and built dams in the river channels. When watering the wheat seedlings for greening, the well water and river water barely sufficed.

    After watering for greening, it was time to water for jointing. But the water had dried up. What to do? Secretary Wang thought and decided to dig each well three feet deeper, which was just enough to water for jointing.

    After watering for jointing, it was time to water for grain filling. The wells and river dried up after a few scrapes. Seeing that the grain filling period was about to pass, there were still more than a hundred acres that had not been watered. This worried Secretary Wang immensely. He thought of solutions day and night. Suddenly, he thought of two ancient wells in the land bordering Liwan Production Team, wondering if they had any water. He decided to go to the ancient wells immediately to take a look.

    Arriving at the border, he saw that a large autumn field of Liwan Production Team intended for planting cotton not only had not been plowed, but even the base fertilizer had not been transported there. The field was overgrown with weeds.

    He was shocked: "Oh! As the saying goes: Cotton should be planted before Grain Rain. Grain Rain has already passed, and this land has not been fertilized or plowed. If it's not planted in time, how can we guarantee a good harvest? Especially with cotton, isn't each day of late planting resulting in several fewer pounds harvested?"

    He uneasily walked to the two ancient wells and looked at them. Both ancient wells had long collapsed.

    That evening, Wangzhuang Production Team held a commune members' meeting. Secretary Wang mobilized everyone to concentrate their efforts to help Liwan Production Team with spring plowing. Because now the water in the river and wells had dried up, the work in their own fields had to be suspended, waiting for water.

    Instantly, people, horses, and vehicles on the street were loading, pulling, carrying, and pushing, making a lively scene.

    Early the next morning, the twenty-six acres of large autumn land of Liwan Production Team were all covered with a three- or four-inch-thick layer of fertilizer. More than a dozen yokes of livestock plowed, harrowed, and sowed, finishing plowing all twenty-six acres of cotton fields before dark.

    In the evening, as everyone was eating dinner in the dining hall, Secretary Wang, worrying about the water, went to the well again to see how much water had risen. As he walked out of the village, he suddenly heard the sound of gurgling water. Looking up, he vaguely saw people standing by the wheat field, each holding tools and busily working, as if doing something. He found it very strange. The commune members were all at home eating dinner, so where did these people come from? Where did the water come from?

    "Who's there?" he asked from afar.

    "It's us, Secretary Wang," one of the people replied.

    He recognized the voice as that of Secretary Li of Liwan Production Team and immediately quickened his pace:

    "Is that Secretary Li?"

    "Yes, it is!"

    "What are you doing here at this late hour?"

    "Watering the wheat!"

    It turned out that Liwan Production Team had weak manpower and animal power, but it had a reservoir with good water conservancy conditions. After watering their own wheat, they saw that the wheat of Wangzhuang Production Team had not been watered, so they diverted the water to water it. The water in the reservoir was abundant, divided into more than a dozen streams, and could water more than a hundred acres of wheat a day. Liwan Production Team, led by Secretary Li, had already watered sixty or seventy acres of wheat for Wangzhuang Production Team.

    Secretary Wang walked up to Secretary Li and said repeatedly, "Thank you, thank you."

    "It's nothing. In the future, we'll have to ask you to help us plow our cotton fields!" Secretary Li replied with a smile.

    "Cotton fields? We've already plowed them for you!"

    Amidst the gurgling sound of flowing water, the laughter of Secretary Wang, Secretary Li, and the commune members resounded.

    邻居
    河南登封中岳庙南新庄  耿振印
    红旗人民公社王庄生产队和卫星人民公社李弯生产队，是紧密的邻居。
    王庄生产队人力、畜力都很棒，但水利条件很差。刚过完春节，党支书王二会就领着搞麦田管理的一班人，早早把井都修理了，河道都筑了拦坝，赶麦苗浇返青水时，井水、河水凑拢来才够用了。
    返青水浇罢，接着又该浇拔节水了。可是水都刮干了，怎么办呢？王支书想想，只好把各个井再往下挖深了三尺，才把拔节水浇了。
    拔节水浇罢，又该浇灌浆水了。井里、河里刮几下就干了，眼看麦子灌浆期快过，还有一百多亩没有浇。这可把王支书着急坏了。他黑夜白天想办法，想来想去，突然想到和李弯生产队交界处的地里有两眼古井不知有水没有。他决定立刻到古井那儿去看看。
    走到交界处，他看见李弯生产队的一段种棉花的大秋地不但没有犁，连底粪还没运来，田里乱蓬蓬的长着一片杂草。
  他吃惊起来：“啊呀！俗话说：谷雨前，该种棉。谷雨已过了，这地还没运粪，还没动犁，不及时种，咋能保证丰收呢？特别是种棉花，晚种一天不就要少收好几斤吗？”
    他心神不安的走到那两眼古井跟前看了看，两眼古井早塌了。
    当天晚上，王庄生产队召开了社员大会。王支书动员大家集中力量帮助李弯生产队搞春耕。因为现在河里、井里的水都干了，自己田里的活得停一停，等水。
    霎时，街上的人马车辆，装的装，拉的拉，担的担，推的推，闹腾起来。
    第二天早起，李弯生产队那二十六亩大秋地全部摊了三、四寸厚那么一层肥料，十几犋牲口犁的犁，耙的耙，耩的耩，赶天黑把二十六亩棉花地全翻好了。
    傍晚，大家正在饭厅里吃晚饭，王支书耽心着水的事，便又到井上去看水上来有多少。他走出村庄，突然听见哗哗哗的水声。抬头一望，影影绰绰的看见麦田边上站着人，每个人都拿着家伙忙来忙去，好像在干什么。他觉得很奇怪，社员们都在家吃晚饭，哪里来的人？哪里来的水？
    “谁在那里？”他远远地问道。
    “我们呀！王支书。”对方一个人回答。
    他听着这声音好像李弯生产队的李支书，立刻加紧脚步往前走：
    “是不是李支书？”
    “就是呀！”
    “这般时候了，你们还在这里干什么？”
    “浇麦呀！”
    原来李弯生产队人力、畜力很弱，但有个水库，水利条件好。他们把自己的麦子浇完后，一看王庄生产队的麦子没有浇，便把水改下来浇起来。水库里的水很大，分十几股，一天能浇一百多亩麦，李弯生产队由李支书领着，已把王庄生产队的麦浇了六、七十亩了。
    王支书走到李支书跟前一看，连声说：“谢谢你们，谢谢你们。”
    “这有什么，将来我们的棉花地，还得请你们帮着犁呢！”李支书笑着回答。
    “棉花地？我们已经替你们犁好啦！”
    哗哗哗的流水声中，响起了王支书、李支书和社员们的笑声。
