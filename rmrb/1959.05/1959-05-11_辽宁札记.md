    Liaoning Notes
    Zhang Pei
    Twelve Hours and Twenty Hours
    In mid-April, during the enchanting spring season, the reporter took the Beijing-Shenyang express train north from Beijing, departing at 7:00 PM. The next morning at 6:55 AM, we arrived in Shenyang. A distance of approximately 1,500 li (750 km), only took a little over eleven hours. It was no exaggeration to say, close your eyes and you’re leaving, open your eyes and you’ve arrived.
    Nowadays, people taking the Beijing-Shenyang express train don’t feel that the speed has greatly increased; it seems like the train should always be this fast. However, things are best understood through comparison. The first time I traveled the Beijing-Shenyang route was ten years ago, in 1949. I remember that the journey took nearly twenty hours, both north and south. In these ten years, our country has undergone tens of thousands of new changes, and these changes together constitute our country's enormous development and progress. Twenty hours and twelve hours, this inconspicuous small change in the train timetable, also provides a minor but convincing footnote to our country's speed of development.
    The Top Seat
    When you arrive in Liaoning Province, you'll feel a strong industrial atmosphere everywhere. Thick smoke billowing from chimneys, rows of factories, towering iron towers, railway lines as dense as spider webs at junction stations... They signal to you: this is a powerful industrial base of our motherland, a typical province with a high proportion of industry. Counting on the map, there are ten cities that can be given the title of industrial city. They supply the whole country with: steel, coal, machinery, synthetic petroleum, locomotives, sea vessels, chemical products, all the way to tussah silk, glassware, and canned food. Among these industrial cities, Anshan should be specially mentioned.
    Who doesn't know Anshan? Yes, all parts of the country are familiar with Anshan, and know that Anshan is our country's first huge iron and steel production center. During the First Five-Year Plan, the whole country used manpower, material resources, and financial resources to support Anshan's construction. What has Anshan become now? Perhaps not everyone knows its current situation.
    Those who have not been to Anshan Iron and Steel may think it's just a large factory, but it's not. It is a joint enterprise composed of more than forty large factories and mines, and its dedicated railway line is longer than that from Nanjing to Shanghai. Even if you drive a car, it will take several days to see all the factories. Now, Anshan has our country's largest modern blast furnaces and open-hearth furnaces. The No. 10 blast furnace, manufactured by our own country, can produce about 3,000 tons of iron per day and night. This is equivalent to 3,000 small blast furnaces each producing one ton of iron per day. So, how many people manage it? Including the furnace chief, gas workers, and furnace workers, there are only eleven or twelve people per shift, and no more than thirty or forty people in total for three shifts a day and night. Its large open-hearth furnace, called the "Open-Hearth King," has a steelmaking capacity of more than 1,000 tons per day and night. One furnace is equal to the entire output of a medium-sized steel plant. However, the larger and more modern the equipment, the more human wisdom and technology are needed, and the more people need to master it sensitively. Otherwise, the furnace will not listen to you, and being large and modern becomes meaningless. Under the leadership of the Party and with the help of Soviet experts, the cadres, workers, and technicians of Anshan have conquered these giants, rare in the world's metallurgical industry, and made them obediently serve the Chinese people. Now, when people stand in front of the large blast furnaces and open-hearth furnaces of Anshan, watching the fiery iron and steel pouring out of the furnaces, they only think about how to produce more and better iron and steel, and do not feel that these large blast furnaces and open-hearth furnaces are anything particularly new. However, those who were in Anshan in 1948 or visited Anshan at that time have not lost their memories. Facing today's prosperity, thinking about the newly liberated 1948, Anshan has crossed such a huge era in ten years. A dilapidated, stagnant Anshan has been transformed into a magnificent, vibrant Anshan in the hands of the working class. Those gentlemen who categorically believed that the Communist Party could only grow sorghum and could never run such a large steel plant well at that time, I don't know where they are now. If they could come and see again, they might change their foolish ideas somewhat. In fact, what was said to be a "large steel plant" at that time is already two different things compared to today. The largest blast furnaces and open-hearth furnaces at that time have now become little brothers. In 1943, the peak production during the Japanese imperialist rule, 840,000 tons of steel were produced that year. In 1958, Anshan produced 4.2 million tons of steel. It is easy to calculate how many times 4.2 million is equal to 840,000. Last year, Anshan's steel production accounted for about half of the total steel production of all modern iron and steel enterprises in the country.
    A huge stone thrown into the water does not only create one wave. The impact of Anshan's great development does not only stay in Anshan; it is playing a role in a wider range. Anshan supplies the country with seamless steel pipes, heavy steel rails, various types of steel plates, steel materials..., this is only one part or one aspect of its role. Another aspect of its role (which people sometimes easily overlook) is that it is the sower in the iron and steel wilderness. It sends talents who master blast furnaces, open-hearth furnaces, and rolling mills to many virgin lands of the metallurgical industry. In 1958 alone, Anshan sent out 26,000 skilled workers, 4,000 engineers and technicians (including 500 engineers), and 8,000 management cadres. From the Jianghan Plain to the outside of Yumen Pass, there are men and women from Anshan. Just think about how much greater role these people will play in another ten years, and how many successors they will train. The construction of our country's modern ferrous metallurgical industry started in Anshan, and what is its future? People cannot yet predict its ultimate scale, but one thing is certain: Anshan has created conditions for us to build a strong steel industry.
    In 1959, Anshan accounts for a huge number in the 18 million tons of steel, and now Anshan, in the ranks of our country's steel enterprises, indisputably sits in the top seat, playing a decisive role. Hundreds of thousands of Anshan Iron and Steel employees are holding high the red flag of the Great Leap Forward of 1958, and are bravely fighting to create higher levels of daily production.
    Everyone Knows
    Shenyang is a large industrial city known throughout the country with the machinery industry as its core. The employees of industrial enterprises alone number more than 500,000. However, it is quite difficult for such a large industrial city to complete the manufacture of six major pieces of equipment in just three or four months. A weightlifter who is good at lifting weights is not necessarily good at playing basketball, and a swimming athlete may be an amateur at playing table tennis. Similarly, a machine tool factory that can manufacture large and precise machine tools may find it very difficult to handle the small, seemingly simple diesel engines for farmland irrigation at the beginning. Shenyang has a famous No. 1 Machine Tool Factory, which is a brand-new machine tool factory built during the First Five-Year Plan, and it produces several types of modern lathes. In the urgent task of producing six key equipment items, in addition to power generation equipment, it also undertook the task of manufacturing 400 diesel engines. At first, people thought that since they could make such top-notch automatic lathes, there would be no problem making diesel engines. However, when the first batch of diesel engines were made, they always failed to ignite during testing. A diesel engine that doesn't ignite is like a small motor on a machine tool that doesn't move, it is a dead thing, how can this work? Later, the masses were mobilized, everyone came up with ideas, and only then did they overcome the technical hurdle. It seems that technology, no matter how high or low, big or small, should never be underestimated.
    However, to mobilize the masses to overcome technical hurdles and other hurdles, the first thing to do is to pass a political hurdle. This political hurdle does not require talking much about the great principles of Marxism-Leninism, but rather to use the simplest methods to let every worker know the current situation and tasks. After March, the progress of the production of six major equipment items in Shenyang City accelerated, one of the reasons being that the Shenyang Municipal Party Committee told every worker about the task of urgently manufacturing six major equipment items and the importance of completing the task through various forms of meetings. Everyone knows why there is an urgent task, and this seems to have added tens of thousands of horsepower of power. The Shenyang Mining Machinery Factory completed the production task of 80 coal washing machines ahead of schedule. One of their experiences was to carry out large-scale publicity, mobilization, competitions, comparisons, and inspections throughout the factory, so that everyone knew and remembered two numbers: 70 million and 7 million. What do these two numbers mean? Seventy million is the annual production capacity of 80 coal washing machines, which can wash more than 70 million tons of coal. Seven million means that completing 80 coal washing machines one month ahead of schedule can enable the country to increase production by nearly 7 million tons of washed coal. It seems that this is just an encouragement, but the encouragement can quickly turn into a huge force to promote production.
    Revolution is the business of the masses themselves, and construction is also the business of the masses themselves. The business of the masses themselves must be handled by the masses themselves. To do it well, the masses must understand why they should do it. When everyone knows why they should do it, the problem can be said to be half solved. The responsibility of the Party lies in guiding the masses, mobilizing the masses, and organizing the masses, and it is impossible to replace the masses in doing it.
    Unnamed Steelmaking Heroes
    Newspapers, pictorials, and movie scenes often feature the magnificent scenery of steel mills with steel flowers splashing everywhere. When seeing such pictures, paintings, and scenes, people are always moved by the heroic images of steelworkers wearing canvas clothes, dark glasses, and holding iron bars in front of high temperatures. Their faces are dark and their sweat is dripping, but they are the most beautiful people.
    However, many people do not yet know that there is another group of heroic and great people who are closely related to steelmaking furnaces, and they are furnace repair workers. Furnace repair workers often work when the furnace is producing abnormally or when production is stopped for maintenance. Therefore, they are not often seen in newspapers and movie scenes. But they are unnamed steelmaking heroes.
    This is an ordinary scene of furnace repair. Anshan's No. 24 large open-hearth furnace is under maintenance, and we happen to be visiting it. The furnace has probably been out of production for a day or two, and six or seven furnace repair workers are working hard in the furnace. I thought, the inside of the furnace is probably not hot now, look, aren't they working calmly and quietly? So I also crawled in. The inside of the furnace is indeed not very hot, because the fire has been stopped for a day or two, but there is still a wave of heat echoing, like noon in the hot summer of the South. I probably only stayed for five minutes before coming out, but what about those furnace repair workers? They were still working quietly and silently, and would continue to work for several hours. After they repair the furnace, they leave. Although they are not in the photos, they have prepared the conditions for steelmaking.
    In the era of revolution and the era of construction, there are tens of thousands of unnamed people who are not often seen in newspapers and movies, but they have made outstanding contributions to the revolution and construction. They are brave people, heroic people. Without them, the revolution and construction cannot succeed, just like without furnace repair workers, it is impossible to keep the steel flowing constantly.
    Not Included in the Construction Blueprint
    Dalian Shipyard is the largest shipyard in northern China. Not long ago, the hull of its 10,000-ton ocean-going vessel was launched. This shipyard originally only built ships and did not manufacture machines. Its main processes are riveting and welding. No matter how big the ship is, it is always riveted and welded with steel plates, so when it comes to riveting and welding technology, the shipbuilding workers are the best. However, now the country has given it the task of manufacturing heavy rolling mills and power generation equipment.
    Each set of two 750/550 rolling mills has 60,000 parts. A large part, the hot shear machine, weighs 32 tons, a cast steel part weighs more than 20 tons, and a herringbone gear weighs tons. This is a big problem for shipbuilding workers. First, there is not so much, let alone such large mechanical processing equipment; second, the people here only understand the characteristics of ships and do not understand the temperaments of rolling mills and steam turbines at all.
    The conditions are very unfavorable, but the conditions can be changed. The shipyard bravely took on the burden, and mobilized the masses to take it on, using technological innovation and technological revolution methods to take it on. Ninety-three sets of special tooling were manufactured, 65% of the rolling mill processing volume was processed by simple equipment manufactured by ourselves, and large parts and small keys were all passed, although every hurdle was not easy to pass. In this way, the difficult situation is heading in the opposite direction. People originally thought that all these efforts were only to complete the state's tasks, but they did not expect that this would bring rich by-products: through the manufacture of rolling mills and power generation equipment, the mechanical processing capacity has been greatly improved, the technical level has been greatly improved, and a dedicated workshop not included in the construction blueprint has been built unconsciously, providing conditions for both shipbuilding and machine manufacturing.
    Difficulties can be transformed, the problem lies in creating conditions. Don't be afraid of difficulties, but accumulate the "capital" to overcome difficulties—create the necessary conditions, so that the objective laws are in your grasp.

    辽宁札记
    张沛
    十二小时和二十小时
    4月中旬，正是媚人的仲春时节，记者从北京乘京沈直达快车北行，开车时间是下午七时。第二天一早六时五十五分就到了沈阳，“里七外八”共约一千五百里路，只走了十一个多小时。一个晚上，闭上眼睛出发，睁开眼睛就到，这样形容一点也不过分。
    现在人们乘京沈快车，并不觉得速度大大提高了，好像火车本来应当就是这样快。可是，事情就怕比较。我第一次来往京沈道上，是十年以前的1949年。记得那时，南来北往车行都将近二十个小时。十年中间，我们的国家发生了千千万万件的新变化，这些变化加在一起，构成了我们国家的巨大的发展和进步。二十小时和十二小时，这个不被人注意的火车时间表上的小变化，也给我们国家的发展速度，落上了一个微小的然而是有说服力的注脚。
    第一把交椅
    到了辽宁省，你处处会感觉到一种强烈的工业的气氛。浓烟滚滚的烟突、鳞次栉比的厂房、巍然高耸的铁塔、枢纽站上密如蛛网的铁路……，它们向你示意：这儿，是我们祖国的一个强有力的工业基地，一个典型的工业比重很大的省份。从地图上数一数，有十个城市，可以加上工业城的头衔。它们向全国输送：钢铁、煤炭、机械、人造石油、火车头、海轮、化工产品，一直到柞蚕丝绸、玻璃器皿和罐头食品。在这些工业城中，应当特别提一提鞍山。
    谁不知道鞍山？是的，全国各地都熟悉鞍山，都知道鞍山是我国第一个巨大的钢铁生产的中心。在第一个五年计划期间，全国曾用人力、物力、财力支援过鞍山的建设。现在鞍山变得怎样了？也许不是所有的人都知道它的近况。
    没有去过鞍钢的人，可能以为它不过是一个大的工厂罢了，其实不然，它是由四十多个大的厂矿组成的联合企业，它的专用铁路线比南京到上海还要长。你即使乘着汽车跑，要看完所有厂子，也得好几天。现在，鞍山拥有我国最大的现代化的炼铁高炉和炼钢平炉。我国自己制造的十号高炉每昼夜的炼铁能力可以达到三千吨左右。这就是说等于三千个日产一吨铁的小高炉。那末，多少人来管理它呢？包括炉长、煤气工、炉前工一起，一个班只有十一、二个人，一昼夜三班加在一起，也不过三、四十人。它的大型平炉，人们叫它“平炉王”，一昼夜的炼钢能力达一千多吨。一个炉子，等于一个中型炼钢厂的全部产量。可是，设备越大越现代化，越需要人的智慧和技术，越需要人灵敏地掌握它。否则，炉子不听你使唤，大和现代化就变得没有意义。鞍山的干部、工人和技术人员，在党的领导和苏联专家的帮助下，已经征服了这些在世界冶金业中也是少有的大家伙，让它们乖乖地为中国人民效劳。现在人们站在鞍山的大高炉和大平炉群跟前，看着火红的铁水和钢水从炉中倾泻出来的时候，在人们的思虑中，只是如何炼出更多更好的铁和钢，并不觉得这种大高炉、大平炉有什么特别新鲜了。可是，1948年就在鞍山或者曾经在那时到过鞍山的人，他们的记忆并没有消失。面对着今天的繁荣景象，想想刚刚解放的1948年，鞍山，在十年中间，跨过了一个多么巨大的时代啊。一个残破的、僵死了的鞍山，在工人阶级手里变成了一个宏伟的、生气勃勃的鞍山。那时，斩钉截铁地认为共产党只会种高粱而绝不可能办好这样一个大钢铁厂的先生们，现在不知道在什么地方，如果他能再来看看，他也许会多少改变一下自己愚蠢的观念。其实，那时所说的“大钢铁厂”，和今天比较已经是两回事了。那时最大的高炉和平炉，现在变成小弟弟了。1943年，是日本帝国主义统治时生产的最高峰，那一年生产了八十四万吨钢。1958年，鞍山生产了四百二十万吨钢，四百二十万等于八十四万的几倍，是很容易算出的。去年鞍钢的钢产量占了全国现代钢铁企业全部钢产量的一半左右。
    巨石投入水中，激起的绝不是一个浪花，鞍钢大发展的影响不只停留在鞍山，它正在更宽阔的范围内发生作用。鞍山供给全国无缝钢管、重型钢轨、各种型号的钢板、钢材……，这只是它的作用的一个部分或者一个方面。它的作用的另一个方面（人们有时容易忽视它），是钢铁原野上的播种者。它向许多冶金工业处女地，输送掌握高炉、平炉、轧钢机的人材。仅仅1958年，鞍钢送出了两万六千个技术工人，四千个工程技术人员（其中有五百个工程师），八千个管理干部。从江汉平原到玉门关外，都有来自鞍山的男女。只要想一想，再过十年，这些人又将发挥出多么巨大的作用，又将培养出多少接班人。我国现代化的黑色冶金工业的建设从鞍山开始，而它的前景呢？人们现在还无法预测它最终的规模，但有一点是可以肯定的：鞍山为我们建设强大的钢铁工业创造了条件。
    1959年，鞍山在一千八百万吨钢中，占有一个巨大的数字，现在鞍山，在我国钢铁企业的行列中，无可争辩地坐着第一把交椅，起着决定性的作用。十几万鞍钢职工，正在高举着1958年大跃进的红旗，为创造更高的日产水平在英勇地战斗着。
    人人都知道
    沈阳，这是一个闻名全国以机械工业为核心的大工业城。仅仅工业企业的职工就有五十多万人。可是，这样大的工业城，要在短短的三几个月的时间里，完成六大设备的制造，却也挺吃力呢。会举重的大力士，不一定擅长打篮球，游泳健将对于打乒乓球可能是个外行。同样，能造大型、精密的机床的机床厂，对于小小的看起来挺简单的农田排灌用的柴油机，在开始时也会觉得很不好办。沈阳有个著名的第一机床厂，这是第一个五年计划期间建设起来的全新的机床厂，它生产着好些种类的现代化车床。在六项重点设备的突击中，除了发电设备外，它还承担了四百台柴油机的制造任务。起初，人们觉得能造出那样头等的自动车床，造柴油机总不会有什么问题，可是第一批柴油机造出来，试验时，总是着不了火。柴油机不着火，等于机床上的小马达不动弹一样，是死家伙，这怎么行呢？以后发动群众，人人想办法，才过了技术关。看起来，技术不论高低大小，都绝不可轻视它。
    可是，发动群众过技术关以及其它的什么关，首先要过一道政治关。这种政治关，并不需要谈多少马克思列宁主义的大道理，而是要用最简明的方法让每个工人都知道当前的形势和任务。沈阳市的六大设备的生产从3月以后，进度加快，原因之一就是沈阳市委通过各种会议形式，把突击制造六大设备的任务和完成任务的重要意义告诉了每个工人。人人都知道，为什么要突击，这一下就好像增加了几万马力的动力。沈阳矿山机械厂提前完成了八十台洗煤机的生产任务，他们的经验之一就是向全厂大宣传、大动员、大赛大比大检查，使得人人都知道都记熟两个数目字：七千万和七百万。这两个数字是什么意思？七千万，是八十台洗煤机的年生产能力能洗煤七千多万吨。七百万，是提前一个月完成八十台洗煤机，就能使国家增产近七百万吨洗煤。看起来这不过是一种鼓舞，但鼓舞能够迅速变为促进生产的巨大力量。
    革命，是群众自己的事，建设，也是群众自己的事。群众自己的事要群众自己办。要办得好，就必须让群众懂得为什么要办。当人人都知道为什么要办的时候，问题可以说解决了一半。党的责任在于引导群众、动员群众、组织群众，而不可能代替群众去办。
    无名的炼钢英雄
    报纸上、画刊上、电影镜头中，经常出现炼钢厂钢花四溅的雄伟景色。看到这种图片、画幅、镜头时，人们总会为那些在高温前穿着帆布衣、戴着暗色的镜子，手执铁钎的炼钢工人的英勇形象所激动。他们脸色黝黑，汗水淋漓，然而他们是最美丽的人。
    但是，许多人还不知道和炼钢炉发生密切关系的，还有另外一部分英勇而伟大的人，他们是护炉工人。护炉工人工作的时候，往往是在炉子生产不正常或者停止生产进行检修的时候，因此，报刊上，电影镜头中，不常容易见到他们。可是他们是无名的炼钢英雄。
    这是一个普普通通修炉的场面。鞍钢二十四号大平炉在检修，我们正好去访问它。炉子大概已经停止生产一两天了，六、七个修炉工正在炉子里紧张工作，我想，现在炉子内大概不热了，你看，他们不是安详地不动声色地在工作吗？于是我也钻了进去。炉内确实不是什么高温，因为已经停火一两天了，可是，仍然回荡着一股热气，有如南方炎热的夏天的中午。我大概只待了五分钟就出来了，而那些护炉工人呢？照样不动声色在埋头工作，而且一直要工作几小时。他们把炉子修好以后就走了。虽然照片中没有他们，可是他们为炼钢准备了条件。
    在革命时代和建设时代，都有成千成万在报刊上、电影中不大看得到的无名人物，但他们却对革命和建设作了出色的贡献，他们是勇敢的人、英雄的人。没有他们，革命和建设都不能成功，就像没有护炉工人，就不可能使钢水常流一样。
    建设蓝图中所没有的
    大连造船厂，是我国北方最大的造船厂。不久以前，它的万吨海轮的船体下水了。这个造船厂本来是只造船，不造机器的。它的主要工艺是铆和焊。不管多大的船，总是用钢板铆焊起来的，所以要讲铆焊技术，造船工人是顶刮刮的。可是，现在国家交给它重型轧钢机和发电设备的制造任务。
    两套七五○／五五○的轧钢机，每套有六万个部件。一个大部件热剪机重三十二吨，一个铸钢件重二十几吨，一个人字齿轮吨把重。这对于造船工人来说，是个大难题。一来，没有这样多更没有这样大的机械加工设备；二来，这里的人只懂得船的性格，根本不摸轧钢机和汽轮机的脾气。
    条件很不利，可是条件是可以改变的。造船厂勇敢地挑起了担子，而且发动群众来挑，用技术革新和技术革命的方法来挑。九十三套专用胎具制造出来了，65％的轧钢机加工量靠自己制造的简易设备加工出来了，大部件、小关键都过了关，虽然每一个关都是不容易过来的。这一来，困难的形势走向它的反面。人们本来以为这一切努力，只不过是为了完成国家任务，可是没有想到由此带来了丰富的副产品：通过轧钢机和发电设备的制造，机械加工能力大大提高了，技术水平大大提高了，一个建设蓝图中所没有的专用工段在不知不觉中建设起来了，为既造船又造机器提供了条件。
    困难可以转化，问题在于创造条件。不要怕困难，但要积蓄战胜困难的“资本”——创造必需的条件，这样，客观规律就在你的掌握中了。
