(Our Dispatch) The 100,000 employees of 800 light industrial factories in Guangzhou, by every possible means, economized on raw materials and materials, and found substitutes, so that the output in the first four months of this year increased by 1.4 times compared with the same period last year.

At the beginning of this year, Guangzhou Paper Mill, because the raw materials were temporarily not supplied, some people proposed to slow down the speed of the paper machine. The Party committee of this factory grasped this thought and immediately handed over the production plan for this year to the workers, and mobilized everyone to launch a blooming and contending debate. At the meeting and in tens of thousands of big-character posters, the workers analyzed the reasons for the temporary shortage of raw materials, and proposed methods such as saving, finding substitutes, and using waste products. As a result, the factory's production not only did not slow down, but also overfulfilled the plan every month from January to April. The workers of more than 120 hardware factories in the city tried to use some native steel to replace foreign steel to produce hardware products. With the great cooperation of the factories, the trial production was finally successful. Now more than a dozen factories have used native steel to produce durable and beautiful knives, nail clippers, bicycle chains, etc. Guangzhou small light bulbs have a large output. In the past, the glass and solder parts of small light bulbs were always burned with gasoline stoves. This year, with the assistance of relevant departments, after many experiments, a gas generator was used to replace the gasoline stove, which increased the output of small light bulbs and greatly improved the quality. The average burning time of small light bulbs produced in February was 17 hours, and in March it rose to 40 hours. Replacing gasoline with gas can also save the country 500 tons of gasoline throughout the year.

While ensuring quality, the workers in various industries also put forward methods to save raw materials in view of product design, technology and operation methods. The workers of the city's largest rubber factory, Factory 210, studied the tread pattern design of the rubber shoe soles and found that the thickness of each part of the tread pattern of the Liberation-style rubber shoes was very unreasonable. After research, they designed a new tread pattern. After trial wear, it was proved that the new tread pattern not only extends the service life by about 20% compared with the original pattern, but also saves 9 tons of raw rubber per million pairs of rubber shoes. According to the same principle, the sneakers they designed can save 18 tons of raw rubber per million pairs. According to the city's output of 12 million pairs of rubber shoes this year, the saved rubber can be used to make 1.14 million pairs of rubber shoes.

Guangzhou's light industrial factories have also adopted self-reliance methods, and have set up factories for three acids and two alkalis. The Guangzhou Municipal Light Industry Bureau alone directly leads the establishment of 25 large alcohol, sulfuric acid factories or workshops. The products produced by some factories can basically meet the needs of their own factories or industries.

Also, Guangzhou light industrial factories are actively taking measures to improve product quality while increasing output.

At present, all industries in Guangzhou have begun to formulate quality standards and inspection methods for the main products of their respective industries. Many factories and enterprises are also starting to formulate product process regulations and inspection systems. Some factories and enterprises have been able to grasp the quality changes of the products produced daily or weekly, and conduct analysis and research regularly (by ten days, by month) to take timely measures to improve product quality. For example, the employees of Guangzhou Yifeng Enamel Factory hold production after-shift meetings every day to exchange production information and study product quality issues. The factory's Party committee also holds a meeting of workshop leading cadres every two days to keep abreast of product quality changes. In order to widely listen to the opinions of the masses on improving product quality, the factory launched a blooming campaign for all employees on product quality. In order to give every employee an opportunity to display their talents, the factory also established a mass scientific and technological research committee; divided into eleven professional groups according to work types, to study from furnace structure, green body modeling to art design and other more than ten aspects to improve product quality. Due to the adoption of various measures, in April, not only was the output value plan overfulfilled by 35.71%, but also the pass rate of products exceeded the national standards. Many factories have also rapidly improved product quality due to the establishment of a regular product quality inspection system to discover and solve problems in a timely manner.

Now, taking various methods to improve product quality has become a major part of the increase production and practice economy campaign carried out in Guangzhou's various industrial sectors. (Attached picture)

    十万工人猛攻原料关
    广州日用工业品优质高产
    本报讯　广州市八百家轻工业工厂的十万职工，千方百计节约原料和材料，寻找代用品使今年头四个月的产量比去年同期增产一点四倍。
    今年年初，广州造纸厂因为原材料一时供应不上，有人提出要放慢抄纸机的速度。这个厂的党委抓住了这种思想，立即把今年的生产计划交给职工，发动大家展开鸣放辩论。职工们在会议上和成千上万张的大字报中，分析了原材料一时不足的原因，提出了节约、找代用品、利用废品等办法，结果这个厂的生产不但没有放慢速度，而且从1月到4月，月月超额完成计划。全市一百二十多家五金工厂的职工们，试用部分土钢代替洋钢来生产五金制品，在各厂大协作下，终于试制成功。现在已有十多家工厂用土钢生产出了耐用美观的小刀、指甲钳、自行车链条等。广州小电珠的产量很大，过去，小电珠的玻璃和焊锡部分，一向是用汽油炉来烧制的，今年，在有关部门的协助下，经过多次试验，采用煤气发生炉来代替汽油炉，使小电珠的产量提高，质量也大大提高。2月份生产的小电珠平均耐燃时间是十七小时，3月份上升到四十小时。采用煤汽代替汽油，全年还可以为国家节省汽油五百吨。
    各行业职工还在保证质量的前提下，针对产品设计、工艺和操作方法提出了节约原材料的办法。全市规模最大的橡胶厂——二一零厂的职工，对胶鞋的大底花纹设计进行了研究，发现解放式胶鞋大底花纹各部位的厚度很不合理。经过研究，他们设计出了一种新的大底花纹。试穿后证明，新的大底花纹不仅比原花纹延长使用时间20％左右，而且每百万双胶鞋可以节省生胶九吨。他们按同一原理设计的球鞋，每百万双可节省生胶十八吨。按全市今年产胶鞋一千二百万双计算，节省下的胶料，就可制胶鞋一百一十四万双。
    广州各轻工业工厂还采取了自力更生的办法。自办三酸两碱等工厂。仅广州市轻工业局直接领导办的就有二十五个较大的酒精、硫酸工厂或车间。有的厂生产的产品基本上可以满足本厂或本行业的需要。
    又讯　广州市轻工业工厂在增加产量的同时，积极采取措施，提高产品质量。
    目前，广州市各个行业都已着手制订本行业主要产品质量标准和检验方法。许多工厂企业也正在着手制订产品的工艺规程和检验制度。有些工厂企业已经能够做到每日或每周掌握生产产品的质量变化情况，定期（按旬、按月）进行分析研究及时采取措施改进提高产品质量。如广州市益丰搪瓷厂的职工，每天召开生产班后会议，交换生产情况，研究产品质量问题。工厂党委也是每两天召开一次车间领导干部会议，及时掌握产品质量变化情况。这个厂为了广泛听取群众对改进产品质量的意见，发动全厂职工对产品质量进行鸣放。为了使每一个职工都有机会发挥自己的才能，该厂还成立了一个群众性的科学技术研究委员会；按工种分成十一个专业小组，从炉灶结构、生坯造型以至美术设计等十多个方面去研究，以提高产品质量。由于多方面采取措施，4月份不仅超额35.71％完成产值计划，而且产品的正品率也超过了国家标准。也有许多工厂，由于建立了定期检查产品质量制度发现问题及时解决，使产品质量迅速提高。
  现在，采取各色各样的方法提高产品质量，已成为广州市各个工业行业开展增产节约运动中的一项主要内容。（附图片）
