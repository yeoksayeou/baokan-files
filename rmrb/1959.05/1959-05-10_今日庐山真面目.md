　　The True Face of Lushan Today
　　Xióng Lǚqín
    Seen from the side, a range; from the front, a peak,
    Varying in distance, height, and breadth;
    Unable to recognize Lushan's true face,
    Just because I am in the mountain myself.
            ——Song Dynasty, Su Dongpo
    Lushan is located in the northern part of Jiangxi Province, towering between the Yangtze River and Poyang Lake. It is a famous scenic area, summer resort, and natural sanatorium in our country. Before liberation, it was a place where the feudal dynasties and reactionary ruling classes indulged in pleasure. Before liberation, Chiang Kai-shek's reactionaries colluded with imperialists externally and gathered all dark forces internally, turning Lushan into the reactionary center for planning the "Fourth Encirclement Campaign" against our Central Soviet Area. Chiang Kai-shek personally convened a series of "Communist Suppression Meetings" in Lushan. At that time, the mountains were covered with bunkers and electric fences. Laboring people needed mountain passes to enter the mountains, had to pay for passage when walking, and sedan carriers had to pay sedan donations.
    After liberation, under the leadership of the Party, the face of old Lushan has been fundamentally changed. If you visited Lushan before liberation, you will hardly believe your eyes when you revisit it.
    Now, you can take a bus directly from Jiujiang to Guling on the top of the mountain. The steep mountain road of Good Men's Slope, once stained with the blood and sweat of sedan carriers, has been replaced by the wide and flat Lushan Mountain Road, which was completed and opened to traffic on August 1, 1958. Later, a ring road and the Rizhao Peak Tunnel were built in the mountains, with Guling as the center. Tourists can take colorful sightseeing buses in Guling, follow the flat mountain ring road, pass through fog and ridges, and tour the East Valley Sanatorium Area, West Valley Sanatorium Area, Lulin Scenic Area, and the main scenic spots of Guling, such as Dalin Temple, Huajing, Xianren Cave, Huanglong Temple, and Lushan Botanical Garden. This road winds around the mountain for fifteen kilometers. The car travels through the mist, crossing ridges and streams. Everywhere are flying waterfalls and springs, and the scenery is beautiful.
    Guling is a beautiful garden city on the top of the mountain, surrounded by towering peaks, with white clouds often lingering around it, and is known as a city floating on the cloud layer. There are flat and wide asphalt roads, and street gardens with flowers blooming in all seasons. The urban area has large-scale Lushan Mansion, Lushan Hotel, cinemas, libraries, theaters, etc. The shops and hotels in Guling are recently busy repairing their facades, actively preparing to welcome guests.
    Lushan has more than one hundred famous historical sites. Before liberation, the Kuomintang reactionaries colluded with local bullies to demolish the ancient Tianchi Pagoda of the Tang Dynasty and plunder precious cultural relics. After liberation, the Lushan Cultural Relics Exhibition Hall was established to specifically protect, sort out, and exhibit Lushan cultural relics. Dalin Temple of the Tang Dynasty and Bailudong Academy where Zhu Xi lectured in the Song Dynasty have been renovated and look brand new. Huajing, the Flower Path of the Tang poet Bai Juyi, has been developed into Lushan Huajing Park. Luli, the hometown of the Jin Dynasty poet Tao Yuanming, has a hot spring, and a new Lushan Hot Spring Sanatorium has been built.
    Lushan is not only a famous summer resort in the country, but also the most ideal high-altitude natural sanatorium in the country. In order to make Lushan better serve the health care of the working people directly, the Party and the People's Government began to build Lushan Natural Sanatorium City from 1953 while developing production. Lushan currently has twelve sanatoriums and twenty-three rest homes. In addition to expanding and renovating the villas of the reactionary rulers into sanatoriums and rest homes for the workers, the Lushan Administration has also vigorously built many new and large-scale sanatoriums and rest homes over the years.
    In last year's Great Leap Forward, Lushan opened lakes on the top of the mountain, raised fish on the top of the mountain, produced rice in the mountainous areas, and sailed boats on the mountain. The historical Lushan consumer area has basically become a production mountainous area. In the one year of the Great Leap Forward last year, the 50,000 people of Lushan, with a revolutionary spirit that overwhelmed mountains and seas, overcame the natural conditions of high mountains and cold water, strong winds and cold land, and barren land, and achieved a great agricultural harvest. The per-mu yield of food crops reached more than 800 catties, and cotton, oil crops, and other crops also had great growth. On the industrial front, last year's total industrial output value of Lushan increased by 295% compared with 1957. Today's Lushan has its own steel base - Saiyang Iron and Steel Plant, and also has a large-scale cement plant with all modern and automated production and equipment. In addition, there are many factories of various types and sizes, mainly based on local resources, combining indigenous and foreign methods, such as machinery, agricultural tool repair and assembly, food processing, brewing, alcohol, bricks, tiles, and fertilizers, which have opened up broad roads for developing mountain production, comprehensively utilizing mountain resources, and promoting the overall development of mountainous areas.
    Under the battle cry of developing mountainous areas, the 10,000 mu of cloud and mist tea gardens newly opened in Lushan last year are now green with branches and leaves, and new tea can be picked in the next year or two. Nearly seventy varieties of famous flowers and beautiful fruits such as apples, grapes, loquats, pears, and peaches have been planted all over Lushan. When spring comes, peach and plum blossoms are fragrant everywhere. "Widow Village," the famous schistosomiasis area at the foot of the Five Old Men Peaks in Lushan and on the bank of Poyang Lake, has now become a large-scale flower and fruit garden. Apples transplanted here for two years have grown red and large, and the autumn fruits have bent the branches. In addition to vigorously developing flowers and fruits throughout the mountain, the focus is now on planting trees and making the garden landscape beautiful. Various large-scale livestock farms have been established in the mountains, raising a large number of Xinjiang sheep, goats, milk goats, cattle, pigs, chickens, rabbits, and various livestock. In the depths of the white clouds on the top of the mountain, flocks of sheep move from time to time, and the moving songs of the herdsmen are heard from time to time.

### 今日庐山真面目

　　今日庐山真面目
　　熊侣琴
    横看成岭侧成峰，
    远近高低各不同；
    不识庐山真面目，
    只缘身在此山中。
            ——宋·苏东坡
    庐山在江西省的北部，耸立在长江与鄱阳湖之间，是我国著名的风景区、避暑胜地和天然疗养区。在解放前，它一直是封建王朝及反动统治阶级恣意享乐的地方。解放前，蒋介石反动派对外勾结帝国主义，对内纠合一切黑暗势力，把庐山变成当时对我中央苏区策划“四次围剿”的反动中心。蒋介石在庐山亲自召开一系列“剿共会议”。那时遍山碉堡、电网四布，劳动人民上山要入山证、走路要买路钱，轿工抬轿要轿捐。
    解放后，在党的领导下，从根本上改变了旧庐山的面貌。如果解放前到过庐山，当你旧地重游，你将难以相信自己的眼睛了。
    现在从九江乘车，可以直达山顶牯岭。从前遍染轿工血汗的好汉坡陡峭山道，已被宽阔平展的庐山登山公路所代替，这条公路全长三十六公里，是1958年8月1日建成通车的。之后，山中以牯岭为中心又修成了环山公路和日照峰隧道。旅客可以在牯岭搭上彩色的游览车，循着平坦的山中环山公路，穿雾过岭，畅游东谷疗养区、西谷疗养区、芦林风景区以及牯岭主要风景名胜大林寺、花径、仙人洞、黄龙寺及庐山植物园等。这条公路循山蜿蜒长达十五公里，车行雾中，跨岭越溪，四望飞瀑流泉，到处林壑幽深，景色美不胜收。
    牯岭是山顶上一座美丽的园林城市，四周奇峰拱立，白云常缭绕在它的身旁，素称浮在白云层上的城市。这里有平坦宽广的柏油马路，有四时花开的街心公园。市区有规模巨大的庐山大厦、庐山宾馆及电影院、图书馆、剧院等，牯岭各商店、旅社，最近忙着修理门面，积极准备迎接客人。
    庐山著名的古迹名胜达一百余处。解放前，国民党反动派曾勾结地方豪绅，拆毁唐代的天池古塔，劫取宝贵文物。解放后，庐山文物展览馆成立，专门进行庐山文物保护、整理及展出。唐代大林寺及宋代朱熹讲学的白鹿洞书院等，修理得焕然一新。唐诗人白居易的花径，已辟为庐山花径公园。晋诗人陶渊明故里温泉的栗里，已新建起一座庐山温泉疗养院。
    庐山不仅是全国著名的避暑胜地，而且是全国最理想的高山性气候天然疗养区。为了使庐山更好地直接为劳动人民保健事业服务，从1953年起，党和人民政府在发展生产的同时，即着手建设庐山天然疗养城。庐山现有疗养院十二所，休养所二十三所。庐山管理局除了把反动统治者的别墅等加以扩建和改建，变为劳动者的疗养院和休养所外，历年来还大力建设很多新的、规模巨大的疗养院和休养所。
    在去年的大跃进中，庐山山顶开湖，山顶养鱼，山区产稻，山上行舟，历史上的庐山消费区，基本上变成生产山区。去年大跃进的一年，庐山五万人民，以排山倒海的革命干劲，战胜山高水冷、风劲地寒、土地瘠薄的自然条件，获得了农业大丰收，粮食作物亩产达八百斤以上，棉、油料和其它作物也有很大增长。在工业战线上，去年庐山工业总产值比1957年增长295％，今日的庐山，建有自己的钢铁基地——赛阳钢铁厂，还拥有一座生产和设备上全部现代化自动化的大型水泥厂。除此以外，还有很多以土为主、土洋结合的机械、农具修配、食品加工、酿酒、酒精、砖瓦以及肥料等大小不同的各种类型的工厂，为开发山区生产、综合利用山区资源、促进山区全面发展开辟了广阔的道路。
    在开发山区的战斗口号下，庐山去年新辟成的万亩云雾茶园，现已青枝绿叶，明后年就可采摘新茶。庐山上下已遍栽下苹果、葡萄、枇杷、梨、桃等近七十个品种的名花美果，春来到处桃李芬芳。庐山五老峰下，鄱阳湖畔著名的血吸虫区“寡妇里”，现在已变成大型的花果园，这里移植两年生的苹果，长出来又红又大，秋实压弯了树枝。全山除大兴花果外，现正以植树为重点，大闹园林化。山中兴办了各种大型畜牧场，饲有大批新疆绵羊、山羊、奶羊及牛、猪、鸡、兔各种牲畜。山巅白云深处，时而群羊蠕动，时而传来牧人动听的歌声。
