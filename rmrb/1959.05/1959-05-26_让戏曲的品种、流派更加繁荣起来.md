Let the Varieties and Schools of Opera Flourish Even More
Zhang Zhen

The Huiju Opera Troupe's performance in Beijing this time has shown us the unique charm of this opera genre. Although the actors are all children of thirteen or fourteen years old, and have only been studying for a little over a year, I really appreciate their conscientious and meticulous performances, their proper demeanor, and their measured movements. Every gesture, every inflection, every action follows the rules. As the ancients said, without rules, there can be no perfect circle. The Huiju Opera Troupe's masters taught them to respect the rules and pay attention to the rules. Therefore, these children who are just starting out on the stage have been able to master the artistic techniques of Huiju Opera quite skillfully, successfully creating some gratifying character images. Moreover, the atmosphere on the stage is rich, permeated with the unique artistic qualities of Huiju Opera, the singing is desolate and vigorous, and the dance is magnificent, all of which show that this is a major opera genre in its own right.

Our motherland is truly vast and abundant, and there are so many artistic schools. In terms of opera genres (opera genres are, of course, different schools of dramatic art), there are already more than three hundred. In particular, these opera genres have such different styles and characteristics. Some are passionate and heroic; some are tender and sentimental; some sing softly, as if weeping; some have complex and urgent sounds, making your ears tingle and your heart ache… This demonstrates the great artistic creativity of our people, and also reflects our people's diverse artistic tastes and high level of appreciation.

A country like ours, with a long history of culture, has very diverse requirements for cultural enjoyment. On the other hand, its creative ability is also very great. They demand that their rich life be widely expressed in art, and that their multifaceted talents for artistic creation be expressed. Thus, we have all kinds of operas and all kinds of artistic schools. If you don't understand our people, and you don't understand our people's history of artistic activities, you can't understand why there are such complex artistic phenomena.

In the past few years, there was a saying that various operas would mix with each other, and finally merge into a single "Chinese National Opera." Some places also based on this opera policy, to force a certain opera genre to "develop new opera." The result, of course, is predictable. The masses do not welcome this new opera without artistic characteristics. The masses are not unwelcome to any new things. Many people quickly accepted drama and ballet. The problem is that if you force an opera genre to abandon its own artistic characteristics and create a "Chinese National Opera" out of thin air, you will of course first be opposed by the local masses who created this opera genre and regard it as their special enjoyment. Some people say that this practice is "grafting flowers onto trees," but I think it can be called "robbing Peter to pay Paul." This is not to enrich, but probably to reduce the cultural enjoyment of the masses. What does this have in common with the "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom" policy?

A question should be answered: Is it good or bad that different opera genres have their own characteristics and styles? Or: Is it good that our country has so many different kinds of art, each competing for beauty and splendor, "just like a riot of color everywhere"? Or is it good to have a big mix, a big merger, and create a "Chinese National Opera" so that everyone watches the same opera? Everyone can think about this question. As for me, I am willing to watch Ping opera today and Bangzi opera tomorrow. I hope they each have different flavors. Each opera genre and each different play expands the scope of my artistic experience, so that I can appreciate various different aesthetic realms. How happy is that! In my opinion, the large number of opera genres and the richness of artistic schools in our country are symbols of our country's long history and developed culture. The lack of a unified "Chinese National Opera" is not a backward phenomenon.

I think that the different styles of each opera genre and the artistic characteristics of each artistic school should be respected and protected, rather than despised and damaged.

Sometimes it is felt that our understanding of the Party's policy of "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom, Weed Through the Old to Bring Forth the New" is not deep or comprehensive enough, and sometimes it is directly violated. For example, some opera genres sound more and more like Peking opera, some opera genres look more and more like Yue opera, and some operas have several scenes in the middle that look more like Western opera no matter how you look at them. Why should a certain opera genre "transform" into Peking opera, and a certain opera genre should develop in the "direction" of Yue opera? It is said that acting in court dramas requires reciting Peking opera rhymes to be most flavorful. But I have also heard Sichuan opera performing Wen Tianxiang and Emperor Liang Wu, Jin opera performing Tang Wang and Guo Ziyi, and Qin opera performing Zhao Dun and Cheng Ying, etc. They do not recite Peking opera rhymes, but they are still dignified and solemn. The creation of characters should not be limited to one style. Different opera genres can and should have different artistic treatments of the performance. Due to such a large amount of Yue opera-style clothing, even Sichuan opera and Kunqu opera, which are so particular about acting styles, also swing their arms back, turn sideways and drag their sleeves down. If this continues, what will be the difference between opera genres in the future? Perhaps some will say that we are learning from brother opera genres. Yes, learning is very necessary. Without learning, there can be no progress. But learning from other people's experiences must be digested and turned into one's own things, and it is not good to simply copy other people's practices. We want both rich and colorful performances and our own unique style. Some comrades always do not pay enough attention to the particularity of things, and do not understand that universality exists in particularity. Therefore, they often require everyone to look the same. You must know that the "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom" policy is precisely to promote the development of the artistic characteristics of each opera genre. If there is no difference in style and artistic means between opera genres, then what is "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom"?

Not only in opera genre style, but also in repertoire, we often see this phenomenon of "one flower blooming alone." Many repertoires were originally available in various opera genres, and they each have their own flavor. For example, Peking opera "The Tale of the White Snake" is elegant in style, while Shanxi Bangzi "Leifeng Pagoda" is sad and intense. The big section of rolling dialogue on "Broken Bridge" is truly exciting. However, since Comrade Tian Han's "The Tale of the White Snake" came out, it has swept the world, and everyone is competing to stage new versions (this is of course understandable), but Shanxi Bangzi's "Leifeng Pagoda" refuses to perform it again, and even the singing opera "Sacrificing the Pagoda" has disappeared from the stage. Also, after the film "The Fairy Couple" was released, many opera genres also adapted this script. There are many similar examples. Comrade Tian Han's "The Tale of the White Snake" and Huangmei Opera "The Fairy Couple" are undoubtedly good operas, but the "Leifeng Pagoda" and "The Seventh Fairy Descending to Earth" of other opera genres can also be good operas if they are reorganized. Why should they be abandoned suddenly? What the masses require of us is "nine different operas out of ten," not uniformity. Yue opera "Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai" is different from Sichuan opera "The Story of the Willow Shade," Jin opera "June Snow" is different from Peking opera "The Story of the Golden Lock," Qin opera "The Orphan of Zhao" is different from Jin opera "The Eight Righteous Men,"… This is our happiness, not a disaster. Seeing what operas are being performed in Beijing, seeing what opera films have been made, and seeing that the newspapers and periodicals say that a certain opera is good, you quickly abandon yourself and follow others, negating your own opera. This is by no means a good thing. Of course, we do not advocate arrogance, but appropriate self-esteem is still necessary. This self-esteem shows love and a deep understanding of the art of one's own opera genre. An opera genre has self-esteem, and it will have strict requirements on its own art, and will not easily adopt the ready-made tricks of other opera genres, and have confidence, and will not easily abandon its own practices. You must know that any opera genre should have a high degree of artistic harmony. Regardless of whether it is a major opera genre, a minor opera genre, a Peking opera genre, or a "local" opera genre, they all have their own unique beauty that cannot be replaced by other opera genres. Some opera genres seem to think that Peking opera dialogue is beautiful, while their own dialogue is "inferior." This is really a misunderstanding. Try to open "Selected Yangko of Ding County" and take a look at how simple and lovely those peasant languages are. Open the poetry collection "Xintianyou" of northern Shaanxi peasants and read it, how sincere and ardent those feelings are. The specific expression of beauty is ever-changing, and it is by no means that only one kind of beauty is needed, and others can be discarded. Even in Peking opera, there are many schools of performance. The singing and acting skills of the four famous female roles are different. These schools should be inherited and developed. In the performances commemorating Comrade Cheng Yanqiu, we are pleased to see that the Cheng school has good successors. I think that in occasions where artistic schools are taught, it is necessary to restore the apprentice system. This makes it easier for teachers to carefully select their successors and strictly supervise their studies, so that several major schools of female roles (Mei, Cheng, Xun, Shang, Xiao Cuihua, etc.), several major schools of male roles (Yu Shuyan [Li Shaochun], Zhou Xinfang, Tan Fuying, Ma Lianliang, as well as the nearly lost Yan Jupeng school, Gao Qingkui school, etc.), and the Xiao Changhua school of clowns, as well as the countless other roles and other schools of other opera genres, can all be inherited, each establish their own schools, and carry forward and expand. You must know that the reason why art produces schools is that this culture has developed to a mature stage, a phenomenon of moving from simplicity to complexity, which meets the requirements of objective reality. Not wanting schools, advocating moving from complexity to simplicity, or advocating unification and mixing, is hindering rather than promoting culture.

We advocate respecting schools and that art with different styles has the right to exist, and that they all receive support and development. Why is this? This is to build our socialism more perfectly. Although our artistic schools are many, there is only one goal: to serve socialism. Talking about service, then the tools and methods of service should of course be more the better, not less the better. We use "Peking" dialogue to serve socialism, and we also use "local" dialogue to serve socialism; we use "The Tale of the White Snake" to serve socialism, and we also use "Leifeng Pagoda" to serve socialism; we use Mei school singing to serve socialism, and we also use Cheng school singing to serve socialism. With everyone adding firewood, the flames are high. The diversity of schools, styles, forms, and themes makes socialist culture more developed rather than more withered, and makes socialist politics have more helpers rather than fewer. Isn't this a very obvious principle? On the unified political basis, the more different their colors and varieties, the better. This is in line with the dialectical law of "unity of opposites." Socialist culture is eclectic, rich and colorful. The more culture develops, the more extensive and diverse people's artistic tastes will be. Any simplistic ideas or narrow views cannot meet the people's increasingly high demands for culture today. Socialist culture must be a large garden with a hundred flowers blooming, with all kinds of colors competing for beauty, rather than just one or two big flowers admiring themselves there.

    让戏曲的品种、流派更加繁荣起来
    张真
    徽剧团这次到北京来演出，给我们看到了这一个剧种的特有的丰采。虽然演员都是十三、四岁的小朋友，学习才仅仅一年多，但我真喜欢他们表演的认真不苟，举止有法，动作有度，举手投足，引喉发声，处处有规矩。古人说，不以规矩，不能成方圆。徽剧团的老师傅教会他们尊重规矩，讲究规矩，于是这些初初上台的娃娃们，竟能够相当熟练地掌握了徽剧的艺术手法，成功地创造了那么些可喜的人物形象，而且舞台上气氛浓郁，弥漫着徽剧特有的艺术素质，唱腔苍凉遒劲，舞姿气度恢闳，处处显出这是一个自成一家的大剧种。
    我们的祖国真是地大物博，艺术上的流派是如此繁多，以剧种（剧种当然是不同的戏剧艺术的流派）来说，已经有三百多种了，特别是，这些戏曲剧种彼此风格又是那么不同，各有特色，有的激昂壮烈；有的缠绵悱恻；有的轻歌细唱，如泣如诉；有的繁音激楚，热耳酸心……这表现了我国人民的巨大的艺术创造才能，也反映了我国人民在艺术口味上的多方面的爱好和高度的欣赏水平。
    像我国这样一个有悠久文化史的国家，人民对文化享受的要求是十分多样的，另一方面，他们的创作能力也大得很，他们要求在艺术上广泛地表现他们的丰富生活，表现他们对艺术创作的多方面的才能，于是，我们就有了各种各样的戏，各种各样的艺术流派，不了解我们的人民，不了解我们人民的艺术活动史，就不能了解为什么会有这么复杂的艺术现象。
    前几年流传过一种说法，说各个戏曲将要互相混合，最后混成功一种单一的“中国民族歌剧”。有的地方也就根据这样的戏曲方针，硬要某某剧种去“发展新歌剧”。结果当然可想而知，群众不欢迎这种没有艺术特色的新戏。群众并不是不欢迎任何新事物的，话剧和芭蕾舞，不少群众就很快接受了。问题是，硬要一个剧种舍掉自己的艺术特色而去向壁虚造一种“中国民族歌剧”，当然首先就要受到创造了这个剧种，把这个剧种当做自己的特殊享受的本地广大群众的反对。有人说这种作法是“移花接木”，我看却可以称为“李代桃僵”，这不是去丰富，而大概要算是去缩减群众的文化享受。这与“百花齐放”的方针有甚么共同之处呢？
    应该回答一个问题，不同剧种的各有各的特色，各有各的风格，是好呢，还是不好呢？或者：我国有这么多品种不同的艺术，各自竞艳争绯，“恰便是姹紫嫣红开遍”好呢？还是来一个大混合，大合并，搞成一个“中国民族歌剧”，大家都看一样的戏好呢？这个问题大家可以都来想一想。就我来说，我是愿意今天看看评戏，明天又看看梆子的，我希望它们各有不同的风味，每个剧种，每个不同的戏都扩大我的艺术感受的领域，使我能够领略各种不同的美感境界，快何如之！据我看来，我国的剧种繁多，艺术流派丰富，是我们祖国历史悠久，文化发达的象征，没有统一的“中国民族歌剧”，并不是一种落后的现象。
    我想，各剧种的不同的风格，艺术流派的各有其艺术特点，应该受到尊重，受到保护，而不是受到轻视，受到损伤。
    有时会感到，我们对党的“百花齐放、推陈出新”的政策，理解还是不深不全面的，有时竟是直接违反的。比如有些剧种，听来竟愈来愈像京剧了，有些剧种，看来竟愈来愈像越剧了，也有些戏曲，中间有几场无论怎么看都更像西洋歌剧。究竟为什么某某剧种应该向京剧“转化”，某某剧种应该向越剧“方向”发展呢？据说：演袍带戏就是念京剧韵白最够味儿。但是我也听过川剧演的文天祥、梁武帝，晋剧演的唐王、郭子仪，秦腔演的赵盾、程婴等，他们不念京剧韵白，同样也不失其端正庄严。创造人物应该是不拘一格的，不同剧种，可以而且应该对演出有不同的艺术处理。由于服装那么大量的越剧化，竟致连川剧、昆曲这么讲究做派的剧种，也来把两支手臂向后一甩，侧身曳袖而下了。这样发展下去，将来还会有什么剧种的分别？也许会说，我们这是向兄弟剧种学习啊。是的，学习十分必要。不学习就不能进步，但是学习别人的经验，总要经过消化，变成自己的东西，而不好照搬别人的作法。我们是又要表演丰富多采，又要有自己独特风格的。有的同志对于事物的特殊性，似乎总是重视得不很够，不了解普遍性即存在于特殊性之中，因此常常要求大家看齐。要知道“百花齐放”的政策，正是为了促进各个剧种的艺术特点都得到发展，如果剧种和剧种之间没有什么风格的不同，艺术手段的不同，那还有什么“百花齐放”呢？
    不止在剧种风格上，在剧目上我们也常看到这种“一花独放”的迹象。许多剧目原是各剧种里都有的，它们各有风趣。例如，京剧“白蛇传”是风格优美的，山西梆子“雷峰塔”则悲凉激切，“断桥”上场一大段滚白，真是激动人心。但自田汉同志的“白蛇传”一出，风靡天下，大家竞排新本（这当然是可以理解的），而山西梆子的“雷峰塔”却再也不肯演了，连唱工戏“祭塔”也从此绝迹于舞台。还有电影“天仙配”上演以后，许多剧种也都改排这个本子。类似的例子还多得很。田汉同志的“白蛇传”和黄梅戏“天仙配”无疑是好戏，但其他剧种的“雷峰塔”和“七姐下凡”整理一下也可以同样是好戏，为什么遽然予以废弃呢？群众对我们的要求是“十戏九不同”，而不是千篇一律。越剧“梁山伯与祝英台”和川剧“柳荫记”不同，晋剧“六月雪”和京剧“金锁记”不同，秦腔“赵氏孤儿”和晋剧“八义图”不同，……这正是我们的幸福，而不是灾难。看到北京在演什么戏，看到电影拍了什么戏曲片，看到报刊上说哪个戏不错，就赶快舍己从人，否定了自己的戏，这绝不是什么好事情。我们当然不主张自高自大，但适当的自尊心还是必要的，这种自尊心表现了对自己剧种的艺术的热爱和深刻的理解，一个剧种有自尊心，它就会对自己的艺术有严格的要求，不肯轻易袭用其他剧种的现成招数，有信心，不轻易放弃自己的作法。要知道，任何剧种都应该具有高度的艺术谐和，不论大剧种，小剧种，京剧种、“土”剧种，都有它们独具的美感，而为其他剧种替代不了的。有些剧种，似乎认为京剧道白是美的，而自己念白是“挎”的，这真是一种误会。试打开“定县秧歌选”看一看，那些农民语言是多么纯朴可爱，打开陕北农民的诗集“信天游”读一读，那种感情是多么真挚热烈，美感的具体表现是千变万化的，绝不是只要一种美感，其他的可以不要了。就是京剧中，表演上的流派也还有很多，四大名旦的唱腔、演技，各有不同，这些流派应该加以继承，加以发展。在纪念程砚秋同志的演出中，我们欣喜地看到程派有了很好的继承者了。我认为，在传授艺术流派的场合下，有必要恢复收徒弟的制度，这样便于老师精选他的传人和严格地督促他们学艺、让旦角艺术的几个大流派（梅、程、荀、尚、筱翠花等），让生角艺术的几个大流派（余叔岩〔李少春〕、周信芳、谭富英、马连良，以及快失传的言菊朋派、高庆奎派等），和丑角的萧长华派以及说不尽的其他行当，其他剧种的各流派，都加以继承，各立门户，发扬光大。要知道，艺术之所以产生流派，是这种文化发展到了成熟期，由简趋繁的现象，是符合客观现实要求的，不要流派，主张由繁趋简，或主张统一起来，混合起来，在文化上是促退而不是促进。
    我们主张尊重流派，主张风格不同的艺术都有存在的权利，都得到扶植和发展，是为了什么呢？这是为了更完美地建设我们的社会主义。我们的艺术流派虽多，但是目标只有一个：为社会主义服务。谈到服务，那么服务的工具，服务的方式当然是越多越好，而不是越少越好。我们用“京”道白为社会主义服务，也要用“土”道白为社会主义服务；我们用“白蛇传”为社会主义服务，也要用“雷峰塔”为社会主义服务，我们用梅派唱腔为社会主义服务，也要用程派唱腔为社会主义服务，众人捧柴火焰高，流派、风格、形式、题材的多样，使社会主义的文化越发达而不是越萎缩，使社会主义政治的帮手越多而不是越少，这不是很明显的道理么？在统一的政治基础上，它们的花色、品种愈不同愈好，这是合于“矛盾统一”的辩证法的规律的。社会主义文化是兼收并蓄，丰富多采的，文化愈发展，人们的艺术口味也将愈广泛，愈多样，任何简单化的想法，狭隘的观念，都不能适应今天人民日益高涨的对文化的要求。社会主义文化必须是一个百卉盛开的大花园，万紫千红，争芳竞艳，而不是仅仅一两朵大花，在那里孤芳自赏。            一九五九年五月
