    Iron Smelting, Steelmaking, Steel Rolling, Mining, and Coking Armies Fight Hard in the Red May
    Anshan Iron and Steel Fifteen Blast Furnaces and Open Hearth Furnaces Report Good News
    Five Steel Rolling Plants, the Chemical General Plant, and the Sintering General Plant Simultaneously Complete Their Early Ten-Day Plans
    Wuhan Iron and Steel No. 3 Coke Oven Undergoes Baking; Shanghai No. 1 Steel Plant No. 1 Blast Furnace's Output Exceeds Design Level
    Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, 11th – In the first ten days of May, five large blast furnaces and ten large open hearth furnaces at Anshan Iron and Steel overfulfilled their production plans. At the same time, five steel rolling plants, the Chemical General Plant, the Sintering General Plant, and others also completed their ten-day plans. During these ten days, the average daily production level of Anshan Iron and Steel, compared to April, saw an increase of 7.6% in pig iron and 2.1% in steel.
    Entering May, the iron smelting, steelmaking, steel rolling, mining, and coking armies of Anshan Iron and Steel have further launched a heat wave of comparing with, learning from, and catching up with the advanced. Blast furnaces No. 3 and No. 9, in the early ten-day competition, produced a total of 1,644 tons of pig iron more than planned. The No. 1 Steelmaking Plant, due to vigorously promoting the advanced experience of open hearth furnace No. 6, had open hearth furnaces No. 1, No. 4, No. 5, and No. 8 alone produce 2,177 tons of high-quality steel more than the early ten-day plan for May. Open hearth furnace No. 24, known as the "Open Hearth King," also increased its steel output by 807 tons more than planned in the first ten days of May due to strengthened furnace maintenance. The coking workshops of the Chemical General Plant, due to implementing advanced technical measures such as increasing furnace temperature, not only overfulfilled the coke production plan for the first ten days of May, but also saw an average daily output increase of 954 tons compared to April.
    Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 11th – The newly built Wuhan Iron and Steel No. 3 coke oven was ignited for baking this afternoon.
    This coke oven is an important project to ensure the early tapping of iron from the Wuhan Iron and Steel No. 2 blast furnace. In order to speed up the project's progress, the furnace-building workers completed the furnace masonry task, which used to take ninety days, in only thirty-five days. This speed is twenty-four and a half days faster than the Wuhan Iron and Steel No. 1 coke oven and four days faster than the No. 2 coke oven. Because the masonry project implemented the policy of more, faster, better, and more economical, the cost was reduced by 24.55%, saving the state more than 600,000 yuan.
    The early completion of the No. 3 coke oven masonry project is the first victory of the Wuhan Iron and Steel workers in the Great Battle of Red May. The furnace-building workers are determined to create even newer achievements in the construction of the No. 4 coke oven.
    Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, 11th – The No. 1 blast furnace of the Shanghai No. 1 Steel Plant, which was put into production in mid-March, has already exceeded its designed daily pig iron output level. According to the design-specified indicators, the daily output of this blast furnace is 340 tons, with a utilization coefficient of 1.34. In late April, the average daily output of this blast furnace had already exceeded the above indicators, with a utilization coefficient reaching 1.397, and all pig iron was of qualified quality.
    This furnace has a volume of 255 cubic meters and is the first blast furnace on the Shanghai steel front. More than 90% of the nearly 1,000 workers engaged in blast furnace production are novices transferred from various industries. Relying on the support and help of veteran workers from sister factories such as Shijiazhuang Iron and Steel, Anshan Iron and Steel, and Benxi Iron and Steel, they adopted the method of learning while producing and initially mastered the operating technology of blast furnaces in just over a month. At the beginning of April, the workers of this blast furnace put forward the battle slogan of breaking through 300 tons to welcome "May Day" and, in response to the main problems affecting the increase in output, such as excessive slag volume and incomplete slag-iron tapping, continuously held various professional meetings and conscientiously studied the advanced experience of blast furnace production at home and abroad. This resulted in the average daily pig iron output in April increasing by 52% compared to March.

    炼铁炼钢轧钢采矿炼焦各路大军奋战红五月
    鞍钢十五座高炉平炉报捷
    五个轧钢厂和化工总厂、烧结总厂同时完成上旬计划
    武钢三号焦炉烘炉　上钢一厂一号高炉产量超过设计水平
    新华社鞍山11日电　5月上旬，鞍钢有五座大型高炉、十座大型平炉，超额完成了生产计划；同时完成旬计划的还有五个轧钢厂和化工总厂、烧结总厂等。这十天，鞍钢的平均日产水平与4月份相比，生铁增长了7.6％，钢增长了2.1％。
    跨入5月，鞍钢的炼铁、炼钢、轧钢、采矿、炼焦等各路大军，都进一步掀起了比先进学先进赶先进的热潮。三号、九号两座高炉在上旬的竞赛中，共比计划多产生铁一千六百四十四吨。第一炼钢厂由于大力推广了六号平炉的先进经验，仅一号、四号、五号和八号等四座平炉，就比5月上旬的计划多产优质钢二千一百七十七吨。号称“平炉王”的二十四号平炉也因为加强了炉体维护工作，上旬的钢产量比计划超产八百零七吨。化工总厂各个炼焦车间由于推行了提高炉温等先进技术措施，不但超额完成了5月上旬的焦炭生产计划，而且平均日产量比4月份增长了九百五十四吨。
    新华社武汉11日电　新建武钢三号焦炉已在今天下午点火烘炉。
    这座焦炉是确保武钢二号高炉早日出铁的重要工程。为了加快工程进度，筑炉工人只用三十五天的时间就完成了过去需要九十天的砌炉任务。这个速度比武钢一号焦炉快二十四天半，比二号焦炉快四天。由于砌砖工程贯彻了多快好省的方针，成本降低了24.55％，为国家节约了六十多万元。
    三号焦炉的砌砖工程提前完工是武钢职工大战红五月的第一个胜利。筑炉工人们决心要在四号焦炉施工中，创造更新的成就。
    新华社上海11日电　3月中旬投入生产的上海第一钢铁厂一号高炉，生铁日产量已经超过了设计水平。按照设计规定的指标，这座高炉的日产量为三百四十吨，利用系数为一点三四；4月下旬这座高炉的平均日产量已经超过了上述指标，利用系数达到一点三九七，生铁质量全部合格。
    这座炉子容积为二百五十五立方公尺，是上海钢铁战线上的第一座高炉。从事高炉生产的近千名工人，90％以上是从各行各业调来的新手。他们依靠来自石钢、鞍钢、本溪等兄弟厂老工人的支援和帮助，采取边生产、边学习的方法，在短短一个多月的时间里，就初步掌握了高炉的操作技术。4月初这座高炉的职工提出了突破三百吨迎接“五一”的战斗口号，并且针对生产中存在的渣量多、渣铁出不净等影响产量上升的主要问题，连续召开各种专业会议，认真学习了国内外高炉生产的先进经验。使4月份的生铁平均日产量比3月份提高了52％。
