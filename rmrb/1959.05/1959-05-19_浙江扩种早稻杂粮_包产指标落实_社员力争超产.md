Zhejiang Expands Early Rice and Coarse Grain Planting
	Output Quotas Implemented
	Commune Members Strive for Overproduction
(Our newspaper, Hangzhou, 18th dispatch) Zhejiang is doing everything possible to expand the planting of early rice and coarse grains, with many communes achieving "not an inch of land left unplanted, not a single point left barren."
	The transplanting of over ten million mu of early rice in Zhejiang Province has basically been completed. At present, the vast numbers of commune members in people's communes throughout the province, after the implementation of output quotas, are greatly boosting their energy and launching a mass movement to exceed output and exceed plans. On the one hand, they are vigorously grasping measures to increase production in order to improve yield per unit area, and on the other hand, they are seizing the season, mobilizing the masses to expand the planting area of early rice and miscellaneous grain crops by conducting field inspections, making every effort to plant crops on all available field edges, corners, riverbanks, and around houses, striving to exceed output and exceed plans.
	After completing the early rice transplanting plan for the entire commune, the commune members of Jintang People's Commune in Zhoushan County immediately launched an expansion planting campaign. They said, "There is an old saying passed down from our ancestors: 'Three parts of the harvest depend on planting, diligent cultivation brings more pigs and sheep.' Especially with early rice, there are fewer disasters from wind, insects, water, and drought, so planting one more mu will yield one more mu." The commune party committee supported the masses' opinion and led the masses to fully utilize all vacant fields to expand the planting of early rice.
	Sun Zifu, the first secretary of the Zhuji County Party Committee, personally convened a "Zhuge Liang meeting" in the fields of the Shisanhuang Production Team of the Paitou Commune, with the participation of production team cadres and experienced farmers. He mobilized everyone to find tricks, think of ways, tap potential, and check for loopholes to discuss how to overfulfill the output quota. After discussion, everyone believed that to exceed output, the first thing to do was to expand the planting area of early rice, and they put forward the slogan "Plant one more mu of land, harvest one more mu of grain." After the meeting, the cadres of each production team immediately mobilized the masses to conduct field inspections and found that there were seventy mu of land that could be used to expand the planting of early rice. Therefore, they arranged labor and adjusted seedlings to quickly plant them. Based on the experience of this production team, the county party committee deployed all production teams in the county to vigorously grasp the expansion of early rice planting and the planting of coarse grains while vigorously grasping field management. All field edges, corners, riverbanks, around houses, waterfronts, and pond edges that could be used to grow grain were to be planted with crops. After conducting field inspections, the Lijiang Management Area of Fengqiao Commune found that there were five types of fields that could still be used to expand the planting of early rice: one was scattered small plots of land; the second was large interlaced fields beyond the boundary, some of which were not included in the plan due to the distance, and some of which were missed; the third was a part of the fields that were not planned to be planted because they were being prepared for reservoir construction and canal digging, but in fact, a single crop of early rice could still be planted; the fourth was a part of the spring flower fields, which could have been planted with early rice, but were not because the land was too poor; and the fifth was waterlogged fields, which were originally only intended to be planted with one season of late rice. There were 684 mu of these five types of fields in this management area, and early rice is currently being transplanted. (Wu Zhaoxiang)

### 浙江扩种早稻杂粮  包产指标落实  社员力争超产

    浙江扩种早稻杂粮
    包产指标落实
    社员力争超产
    本报杭州18日电　浙江各地千方百计扩种早稻、杂粮，不少公社做到“寸土不让，一分不荒”。
    浙江省一千多万亩早稻插秧已基本结束。目前，全省各地人民公社广大社员在包产指标落实后，大鼓干劲，正在掀起一个超包产、超计划的群众运动，一方面大抓超产措施，以提高单位面积产量，另一方面抓住季节，发动群众通过田野检查，千方百计地扩大早稻和杂粮作物的种植面积，把可以利用的田头、地角、河边、屋旁都种上作物，力争超包产、超计划。
    舟山县金塘人民公社的社员们，在完成全社早稻插秧计划后，随即开展了扩种运动。他们说：“祖辈相传有句老话说：‘落田三分收，勤耕猪羊多’，特别是早稻，风虫水旱灾害比较少，多种一亩就能多收一亩。”公社党委支持群众这个意见，带领群众充分利用一切空隙田扩种早稻。
    诸暨县委第一书记孙子甫，亲自在牌头公社十三黄生产队的田头召开生产队干部和有经验的农民一起参加的“诸葛亮会”，发动大家找窍门，想办法，挖潜力，查漏洞，讨论如何超额完成包产指标。经过讨论，大家认为要超包产，首先要扩大早稻的种植面积，他们提出了“多种一亩田，多收一亩粮”的口号。会后，各生产队干部立即发动群众进行田野检查，发现有七十亩田可以扩种早稻，于是就安排劳力，调剂秧苗，迅速种上。县委根据这个生产队的经验，部署全县各生产队在大抓田间管理的同时，大力抓扩种早稻，大种杂粮，凡是能够种粮食的田头、地角、河边、屋旁、水脚、塘沿都要种上作物。枫桥公社栎江管理区进行田野检查后，发现有五种田还可以扩种早稻：一种是零星小块田；二是越界的大块插花田，这类田有的是由于路远，没有列入规划，有的是被漏掉的；三是有一部分田因为准备修水库、挖渠道，也不准备种了，其实还可以种一熟早稻；四是一部分春花田，本来可以种早稻，因为田瘦不想种了；五是水涝田，原来是只准备种一季晚稻的。这五类田在这个管理区就有六百八十四亩，目前正在插种早稻。　（吴兆祥）
