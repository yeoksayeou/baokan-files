　　Surge Ascents and Balanced Ascents
　　Wang Pu

Increasing production can be approached in two ways: surge-style ascents and balanced ascents. The Jiang'an Vehicle Depot Repair Workshop uses the latter method, and this method should be greatly promoted.

Production, like the development of all things, progresses in a wave-like manner and cannot be absolutely balanced. For an enterprise, raw materials, collaborative products, tools, equipment, even the weather and people's emotions, cannot be readily available, uniform, or consistent at every moment. There will always be surpluses and shortages, good and bad, fast and slow, high and low. To demand that production rise in a straight line every day, every ten days, every month, and every quarter without any fluctuations is impossible in real life unless conservative balancing methods that accommodate the backward are adopted.

Recognizing this objective law of wave-like progress can prevent us from being subjective, so that we dare not unleash our efforts when conditions are good, and we do not run too far from reality when conditions are poor. However, this steady progress of closely following reality, sometimes faster and sometimes slower, must not be confused with the situation where some enterprises rise sharply in production at times, and then fall below the horizontal line at other times. The former is acting in accordance with objective laws, and both the attack and the rest are proactive, so production is orderly and potential is fully mobilized. The latter is the result of an incorrect working method. Some enterprises, with objectively good conditions, such as having all the materials for a month, still experience a loose front and a tight back in production, with idling in the first half of the month and a surge in the second half. Obviously, this situation cannot be called normal wave-like progress, but can only be said to be a result of poor work, suffering from the problem of "unbalanced production."

On the one hand, we must acknowledge the objective law of wave-like development in production. On the other hand, we must strive for balanced production as much as possible when objective conditions permit. This is especially important for grassroots production units and for shorter periods, such as the daily, ten-day, or monthly production arrangements, and it is also relatively easy to achieve. The Jiang'an Vehicle Depot Repair Workshop specifically grasped the daily production progress with a small blackboard and organized balanced production. Of course, the production of this workshop may be relatively simple. However, no matter how complex the enterprise, the basic principle is the same. As long as we closely grasp the production situation, do a good job of organization, and do a good job of preparation, relatively balanced production can always be achieved.

Balanced production is of great benefit to increasing production and practicing economy. With balanced production ascents, work is orderly, quality is guaranteed, labor efficiency and equipment efficiency can be fully utilized, and the economic effect is good. Moreover, in terms of output alone, steady ascents often yield more than sharp rises and falls when calculating the total annual account. The purpose of reporting the achievements of the Jiang'an Vehicle Depot Repair Workshop is not to introduce their experience in using small blackboards. Because the situations of each enterprise are different, and the clever methods are also different. Our purpose is only to hope to remind everyone to pay attention to balanced production and strive for balanced ascents in production.

　　突击上升和均衡上升
　　王朴
    增产，有两种做法。一种做法是突击式上升，一种做法是均衡地上升。江岸车辆段修理工场用的是后一种办法。这种办法要大大提倡。
    生产，同其他一切事物的发展规律一样，总是波浪式地前进、不可能绝对地均衡。拿一个企业来说，原料、协作产品、工具设备，以至天的气候，人的情绪，不可能时时刻刻每一样都那么凑手，都那么整齐划一；总是有多有少，有好有坏，有快有慢，有高有低。要求生产每天每旬每月每季都是没有丝毫波动地直线上升，除非采取迁就落后的保守的平衡方法，否则在实际生活中是不可能出现的。
    认识这种波浪式前进的客观规律，可以使我们防止主观主义，不致在条件好的时候不敢放手跃进，在条件差的时候，又脱离实际跑得过远。然而，这种紧紧跟随着实际，时而快些时而慢些的稳步前进，决不能同有的企业在生产上时而上升得很猛，时而又跌到水平线以下的情况混为一谈。前者是按照客观规律办事，进攻和休整都是主动的，因而生产是有秩序的，潜力是被充分动员的。后者则是一种不正确的工作方法所得的结果。有的企业，本来客观条件很好，例如说，一个月里的材料都齐备了；但是，生产仍然前松后紧，上半月窝工，下半月突击。显然，这种状况就不能叫做正常的波浪式前进，而只能说是由于工作没有做好，害了“生产不均衡”的毛病。
    我们一方面要承认生产是波浪式发展的客观规律，一方面又要在客观条件允许的情况下力求生产均衡。这对于基层的生产单位，对于较短的期间，例如一天一旬一月的生产安排，尤其重要，而且也比较容易做到。江岸车辆段修理工场就是以小黑板具体掌握每日生产进度，组织了均衡生产。当然，这个工场的生产可能比较简单。但是，不管多么复杂的企业，基本道理总是一样的。只要紧紧掌握生产情况做好组织工作，做好准备工作，相对的均衡生产总是可以做到的。
    均衡生产，对于增产节约，好处可是大得很哩。生产均衡地上升，工作有秩序，质量有保证，劳动效率和设备效率可以充分发挥，经济效果又好。而且，单就产量来说，在一年里算个总账，稳步上升也常常比猛升猛降的来得多。我们报道江岸车辆段修理工场的成绩，目的并不是介绍他们运用小黑板的经验。因为各个企业的情况不同，巧妙也不同。我们的目的只是希望能够提醒大家：重视均衡生产，力争生产均衡地上升。
