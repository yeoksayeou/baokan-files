The Flower of Collaboration
    ——A Record of the “Supply and Sales Home” of the Daily Necessities Industry in the Central District of Guangzhou
    By our reporter Zhao Ying
    One evening in early May, on the bustling Xia Jiu Road in Guangzhou, I stepped into the "Supply and Sales Home" praised by people as the flower of collaboration.
    New Things
    Upon entering this "home," the first thing that struck me as new was that the supply and sales cadres of thirty daily necessities factories were cheerfully and openly sharing their business "secrets." Xu Jian, the supply and sales section chief of Rongji Electric Bulb Factory, grinningly pulled out a telegram from Wuzhou from his pocket and showed it to his colleagues. The telegram stated that glass tubes for making electric bulbs were for sale there. He also arranged for personnel from some factories to go to Wuzhou to buy them together. The four walls of this "home" were covered with labels detailing the raw material situation of each factory. Below each factory name were three columns: the top column indicated the names and quantities of raw materials purchased by the factory; the middle column listed the raw materials that could be supplied to brother factories; and the bottom column specified what help was needed from other factories. In another corner, I saw an interesting column publishing raw material leads. The supply and sales cadre of Xingguang Glass Factory wrote in the provided leads: "Zircon sand can replace borax; the metallurgical factory has it for sale." There are so many meaningful things like this. They not only exchange information on raw material procurement there, but also compete in enthusiasm, spirit of cooperation, and completion of production tasks.
    Born in the Great Leap Forward
    The supply and sales work of a factory is as important as the blood vessels of a person, as it must supply enough raw materials for production. In order to feed the factory's machines sufficiently, the supply and sales personnel diligently inquired and ran around everywhere year after year. However, before seriously engaging in large-scale collaboration, each supply and sales person was grabbing raw materials for their own factory. Some units grabbed raw materials and stored them in their own warehouses, while other units could not find urgently needed raw materials despite all their efforts.
    This year's Great Leap Forward in Guangzhou's industrial production has presented new and important tasks for supply and sales personnel, which is to supply more and better "food" for industrial production. How can this task be accomplished? The supply and sales personnel were all considering this question, but could not come up with a good solution. It happened that the Central District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party called for the launch of inventory clearing and the convening of a Mule and Horse Conference. At the meeting, the raw materials needed and surplus by each factory were presented in the form of big-character posters, and as a result, most of the raw materials needed by more than 400 factories in the district were resolved at the meeting. This meeting gave the supply and sales personnel an inspiration. After the meeting, they discussed in groups of three or five that this method was good and could effectively solve the problem. Soon, at a supply and sales personnel meeting convened by the District Committee, the experience of Liang Su Ji, Quanmin, and Shangyou umbrella factories in organizing a joint raw material procurement group was introduced. These three factories divided the umbrella raw materials into umbrella handles, iron wire, and umbrella hooks, which were procured and evenly distributed by the three factories separately, so that the three factories could achieve balanced production and eliminate the phenomenon of Factory A having too many umbrella handles but lacking umbrella hooks, while Factory B lacked umbrella handles but had too many umbrella hooks in the past. Industries such as glass, electric bulbs, and rubber shoes learned from this method and also organized raw material procurement groups one after another.
    The idea of using everyone's strength to do a good job in raw material supply educated this group of supply and sales cadres, and they could not wait to establish the "Supply and Sales Home." At the first "home" meeting, everyone adopted the method of using special column labels to publicize raw materials in order to facilitate mutual exchange, and stipulated that two evenings a week would be "home" activity days. In the usual raw material exchange work, telephone contact was also used to solve problems, which they called "supply and sales network." The meeting also specifically adopted the method of monthly evaluation of thought and work to promote procurement work and improve the members' thinking.
    Abundant Fruits
    Without others' introduction, people can see how wonderful this method is just by carefully flipping through the labels. On April 9, Gaofeng Glass Factory posted a label in the lower column stating "Urgently needed thinner," and on the same day, the middle column of Wenguang Glass Factory recorded "Thinner has been given to Gaofeng Factory"; Hengli Glass Factory also supplied Quanmin Umbrella Factory with nickel sulfate; and the National Glory, Tianguang, and Xinxiangxing factories, which were rated as model workers in April, could all be seen from the labels that they supplied more to others than they asked others for help.
    The spirit of collaboration has changed the relationship between people, achieving the goal of common progress in production. In the past, the purchasing personnel of Gaofeng and Wenguang factories often competed for raw materials. This time, as soon as Wenguang Factory asked the "home" for glass sheets, Gaofeng Factory immediately took the initiative to give some of the glass sheets it had purchased from Nanning to Wenguang Factory. In late March, when the entire industry was engaged in a high-yield campaign, the members of the "Supply and Sales Home" held a preparatory meeting in advance to study the raw material surpluses and shortages of each factory, and finally helped several factories solve the difficulty of insufficient raw materials in the high-yield campaign, so that the production of each factory continued to improve.

    协作之花
    ——记广州中区日用品行业“供销之家”
    本报记者　赵颖
    5月初的一个傍晚，在广州市热闹的下九路上，记者跨进了这个被人们誉为协作之花的“供销之家”。
    新鲜事
    进入这个“家”里，头件使人感到新鲜的是，这里三十个日用品工厂的供销干部，正在欢愉舒畅地公开他们业务上的“秘密”。荣记电珠厂供销股长徐健，笑嘻嘻地从怀里掏出一份梧州来的电报，送给他的同行们看。这封电报上写着那里出售制造电珠材料的玻璃管。他还约定了一些工厂的人员一道到梧州去买。这个“家”的四壁上，贴满了各厂原材料情况的标签。每家厂名的下面都有三个栏目，最上栏是标明本厂购进原材料的名称和数量，中栏写着可以支援兄弟厂的原材料，最下一栏是需要别厂帮助些什么。在另一个角落里，记者看到了一个公布原材料线索的有趣的专栏。星光玻璃厂供销干部提供的线索里写道：“锆英石可代替硼砂，冶金厂有出售”。像这样有意义的事情真多。他们不仅在那里交流原材料采购的情况，而且还在一起比干劲、比协作精神和完成生产任务的情况。
    大跃进中诞生的
    工厂的供销工作，像人的血管一样重要，它要为生产供应足够的原材料。为了使本厂的机器吃饱吃好，供销员们长年累月，勤快地到处探询和奔跑。但是在认真进行大协作以前，每一个供销员都是为了自己工厂抓原材料。有些单位把原材料抓到手往自己的仓库里装，而有些单位有些急用的原材料却踏破铁鞋无觅处。
    今年广州工业生产大跃进，为供销人员提出了新的重要的任务，这就是为工业生产供给更多更好的“粮食”。怎样来完成这个任务呢？供销人员们都在考虑这个问题，但是却想不出个上策来。刚好中共中区委员会号召开展清仓和召开骡马大会，会上用大字报的形式提出各厂所需和所余的原材料，结果全区四百多家工厂所需的原材料绝大部分在会上解决了。这个会给供销人员一个启发，会后，他们便三五成群地议论这个办法好，能有效地解决问题。不久，在区委召开的供销员会议上，介绍了梁苏记、全民、上游三个制伞厂组织原材料采购联合小组的经验，这三个厂把伞的原料分为伞柄、铁丝、伞钩三部分，由三家厂分头采购、平均分配，使这三个厂能够均衡生产，消灭了过去甲厂多伞柄缺伞钩，乙厂又缺伞柄多伞钩的现象。玻璃、电珠、胶鞋等行业学习了这个方法，也先后组织成原材料采购小组。
    用大家力量来做好原材料供应工作的思想，教育了这群供销干部们，他们便迫不及待地成立了“供销之家”。在召开第一次“家”的会议上，全体通过了用设专栏标签的办法公开原材料，以便于互通有无，并且规定了每星期有两个晚上为“家”的活动日，在平时原材料的互通有无工作，也确定用电话联系解决，他们把这叫做“供销网”。会上还特地通过了用每月评比思想和工作的方法来推动采购工作和提高成员的思想。
    丰硕的果实
    不用别人介绍，只要细细翻看一下标签，人们就可以看出这个办法有多么妙。4月9日高峰玻璃厂在下栏贴出了“急需天那水”的标签，同一天文光玻璃厂的中栏就记下了“天那水已给高峰厂”；衡力玻璃厂还支援了全民制伞厂硫酸镍；还有被评为4月份标兵的国光、天光、新祥兴等厂，都可以从标签上看到他们支援别人的比请别人帮助的要来得多。
    协作思想改变了人和人的关系。达到了生产共同跃进的目的。过去高峰和文光工厂购销人员常常争原材料。这次，文光厂刚刚向“家”里提出缺玻璃片，高峰厂就立即主动把自己从南宁采购回来的部分玻璃片让给了文光厂。3月下旬全行业搞高产运动时，“供销之家”的成员就预先开准备会议，研究各厂原材料余缺的情况，终于帮助好几个厂解决了高产运动中原材料不足的困难，使得各厂生产都有了不断的提高。（附图片）
