　　Profound Changes in Education
    Speech by Committee Member Shao Xunzhen
    I wholeheartedly and enthusiastically support the government work report made by Premier Zhou and the other reports I have heard in the past few days. I would like to express some of my thoughts with extreme excitement.

    In the past few years, under the correct leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, we have achieved extremely brilliant achievements in our socialist revolution and socialist construction. In particular, in 1958, under the illumination of the socialist general line, our undertakings in various fields have developed by leaps and bounds, making our country change at a pace of one day equaling twenty years. The Party's leadership in various departments and units has been strengthened, the political consciousness of the people throughout the country has been raised to an unprecedented level, and there has been a deeper understanding and recognition of the spirit of the general line and the set of policies of "walking on two legs." In this way, we have a full guarantee for this year's all-out and comprehensive great leap forward. This is something worth cheering and taking pride in.

    In the past few days, everyone in the meeting has been enthusiastically discussing the great achievements of our undertakings in various fields over the past year. This has been profoundly educational for me. I think it is very necessary for us to talk about the achievements of 1958, because last year's achievements are the basis for the current greater leap forward. We must fully understand this basis and give it sufficient valuation in order to know how to leap forward better and faster.

    As an educator, I am very excited about the achievements and tasks on the cultural and educational front mentioned in the Premier's report. I think the achievements we have made in this area in 1958 are also epoch-making. "With the advent of the socialist economic upsurge, a socialist cultural upsurge has begun to rise in our country." This upsurge is in full swing and its momentum is fierce, demanding the destruction of many obstacles of old things. It requires a fundamental change in the unreasonable situation of the separation and opposition between mental and physical labor that has existed for thousands of years, requires the working people to become the masters of culture, and requires the old intellectuals to become ordinary laborers in society. This trend has formed a dramatic ideological and cultural revolution. In such a revolutionary tide, our cultural and educational undertakings have been vigorously developed. Therefore, as the Premier pointed out in his report, to assess the achievements of education, we should not only focus on the quantity of development, but should make a correct and full assessment of the huge and profound changes that have taken place in the entire undertaking. This is my understanding of the relevant passage in the Premier's report. I will talk about my views on these changes below. If there are any inaccuracies, please give me your advice.

    The Combination of Education and Productive Labor Greatly Improves the Quality of Teaching

    The most significant achievement of the great leap forward in education last year, I think, is also the most important one, that is, the policy of combining education and productive labor has been implemented. In schools, students' participation in productive labor is included in the formal curriculum and occupies a very important position. This is an epoch-making innovation that has never existed in ancient or modern times, in China or abroad. Such an important reform in teaching will inevitably promote teachers, so teachers also rush to ask to be sent to lower levels, or go to factories, mines, and communes with their students, to teach and participate in productive labor within their ability, in order to quickly improve their class consciousness and ideological level. In this way, our policy of education serving the politics of the working class has an important guarantee. What I would particularly like to point out is that as a result of doing so, our teaching quality has also improved significantly, because whether for students or teachers, in the process of participating in labor, they have enriched their direct experience and cultivated their ability to solve practical problems with theory, creating better conditions for teaching and learning. In this way, we can better implement the principles of more, faster, better, and more economical in teaching. At present, students spend more than 30 percent of their study time participating in productive labor, and the time spent with books has indeed been reduced, but their ability to think and understand has greatly improved, and the purpose of learning has been clarified, so they can learn more useful knowledge in less time and improve the quality of learning. This is something that bourgeois educators cannot imagine.

    Achievements in Mass Scientific Research

    Secondly, we should mention the great achievements of mass scientific research. Under the strong leadership of the Party, the masses are engaged in science, which ensures that the policy of science serving politics and serving production is implemented. The mass line has become the main working method in scientific research, fundamentally changing the past situation of cold and deserted, and a few people engaged in science, and has achieved great results. The achievements of mass scientific research in schools, I would like to take the situation of the History Department of Peking University, which I know, as an example to illustrate. Last year, first, second, and third-year students of the History Department of Peking University went to mines, factories, communes, troops, and commercial departments to write the history of workers, peasants, commerce, learning, and soldiers. All fourth and fifth-year students participated in the investigation of minority areas to write the history of various ethnic groups. This belongs to the creative writing aspect. They have also played a great role in the construction of teaching materials. They either write the first draft of the teaching materials in a short period of time to provide a useful basis for teaching, or put forward full and specific suggestions for the revision of existing teaching materials. In terms of data collection, some of the first-year students who participated in the writing of the History of Beijing completed 600,000 words of card work in two weeks. As far as I know, other schools have the same or better results. Judging from the remarkable achievements of the masses engaged in science, it can prove the endless wisdom of the masses and make people feel that young students are formidable and lovely. If we want to greatly develop our socialist culture in a short period of time, we must adhere to the masses engaged in science. We ourselves also see very clearly that if we do not combine with the masses, the most we can make are some extremely limited contributions, or even no contributions that are beneficial to our society. Therefore, we are willing to honestly bow our heads and learn from the young masses. We realize that "walking on two legs" is also needed in science, but no leg can be separated from the mass line. In scientific research, we must look at the near and the far, but the long-term interests and the mass line are not opposed. Isn't a longer-term and systematic research more in need of and able to give full play to collective strength?

    Establish a New Teacher-Student Relationship

    We cannot measure the profound changes in our cultural and educational undertakings by the achievements we have made in teaching and scientific research in a short period of time. We must see that the spiritual outlook of the entire education has fundamentally changed. For example, the establishment of equal and democratic relations between teachers and students also illustrates the fundamental changes in the relationship between people in our society. In my experience, the new teacher-student relationship is a socialist relationship of teaching and learning from each other, with mutual concern, mutual supervision, and mutual assistance in politics and academics. The comradely unity of teachers and students under the leadership of the Party is an important guarantee for the rapid achievement of teaching and scientific research, and it is also an important way for teachers to accelerate their self-transformation. Under the conditions of putting politics in command, it is not very difficult to greatly develop cultural and educational undertakings so that our superstructure can better serve the foundation.

    Premier Zhou pointed out in his report: "To establish a contingent of tens of millions of working-class intellectuals is a great historical task on the cultural and educational front." Like other cultural and educational workers, I want to contribute my greatest strength to this glorious work, and at the same time accelerate my own transformation to become a vanguard in the contingent of tens of millions of working-class intellectuals.

### 教育事业的深刻变化  邵循正委员的发言

　　教育事业的深刻变化
    邵循正委员的发言
    我衷心地、热烈地拥护周总理所作的政府工作报告和这几天所听到的其他各项报告。我以极其兴奋的心情来说出我的一些感想。
    几年以来在党和毛主席的正确领导下，我们社会主义革命、社会主义建设取得了极其辉煌的成就。特别是一九五八年在社会主义总路线的照耀下，我们各方面的事业有了飞跃的发展，使我们国家起了一天等于二十年的变化。党在各部门、各单位的领导加强了，全国人民的政治觉悟空前提高，对于总路线的精神和“两条腿走路”的一套方针，也有更深刻的体会和认识，这样，我们今年全民全面的大跃进就有了充分的保证。这是值得我们大大欢呼引以自豪的事情。
    这几天在会议中，大家热烈谈论这一年多我们事业各方面的伟大成就。这对于我说来是有深刻的教育意义。我想我们大家交谈一九五八年的成绩是十分必要的，因为去年的成就，就是当前更大跃进的根据，我们必须充分了解这个根据，给以足够的估价，才知道如何更好、更快地跃进。
    作为一个教育工作者，我对于总理报告中所谈到的文教战线上的成就和任务，感到十分兴奋。我想一九五八年我们在这方面所取得的成就，也是划时代的。“随着社会主义的经济高潮的到来，在我国开始兴起了一个社会主义的文化高潮。”这个高潮方兴未艾，来势猛烈，要求摧毁许多旧事物的障碍。它要求根本改变几千年来脑力劳动和体力劳动分离对立的不合理情况，要求劳动人民成为文化的掌握者，要求旧知识分子成为社会普通劳动者。这个潮流就形成为一次剧烈的思想文化革命。在这样革命的潮流中，我们文教事业得到了蓬勃的发展。因此正如总理在报告中所提示我们的，要估价教育事业的成就，不要单从发展的数量上着眼，而应该从整个事业所发生的巨大的、深刻的变化作出正确的、充分的估计。这是我对于总理报告中有关的一段话的体会。后面就谈一下我对于这些变化的看法，不对之处，请同志们指教。
    教育与生产劳动结合，大大提高了教学质量
    去年教育事业大跃进的成就，最显著的，我想也是最主要的，就是教育和生产劳动结合的方针得到了贯彻。在学校中，学生参加生产劳动列入教学正式课程之中，而且占了极重要的地位，这是古今中外所没有过的划时代的创举。教学方面这样重要的改革必然推动了教师，于是教师们也争先恐后地要求下放，或是和同学一起到厂、矿、公社中去，一面进行教学，一面参加力所能及的生产劳动，以求迅速提高自己的阶级觉悟和思想水平。这样，我们教育事业为工人阶级政治服务的方针就有了一个重要保证。我特别想说明的就是这样做的结果，我们教学质量也就有显著的提高，因为无论对于学生或是教师，在参加劳动的过程中，丰富了自己的直接经验，培养了自己用理论解决实际问题的能力，对教学和学习都创造了更好的条件，这样，我们就更能够在教学中贯彻多、快、好、省的原则。目前学生以百分之三十以上的学习时间参加生产劳动，抱书本的时间确是减少了，但思考和了解的能力大大地提高了，学习的目的性明确了，就能够以较少的时间学到更多更有用的知识，提高学习的质量。这是资产阶级教育学者所不可能想像到的。
    群众性的科学研究的成就
    其次，应该提到群众性科学研究的巨大成绩。在党的坚强领导之下群众搞科学，这就使得科学为政治服务、为生产服务的方针得到了贯彻。群众路线在科学研究中已经成为主要的工作方法，根本改变了过去冷冷清清、少数人搞科学的局面，取得了巨大的成绩。学校中群众性科学研究的成就，我想拿自己所知道的北京大学历史系的情况来说明。去年，北大历史系一、二、三年级学生曾经到矿、厂、公社、部队和商业部门，大写了工、农、商、学、兵的历史，四、五年级全部学生参加了少数民族地区的调查工作，大写各民族的历史，这是属于创造性写作方面的。在教材建设方面，他们也起了很大的作用，他们或是在很短期间写出教材初稿给教学提供有益的基础，或是对于已有教材提出充分的具体的修改意见。在资料搜集方面，参加北京史编写工作的一部分一年级学生，在两星期内完成了六十万字的卡片工作。据我所知，别的学校也有同样或是更好的成绩。从群众搞科学的显著成就看来，可以证明群众智慧的无穷无尽，可以使人感到青年学生可畏可爱。我们想在短时期内大大发展我们社会主义文化，非坚持群众搞科学不可。我们自己也看得很清楚，假如不与群众结合，所能做出的充其量只是一些极有限的贡献，甚至根本做不出对我们社会有益的贡献，因此，都愿意老老实实地俯首向青年群众学习。我们认识到在科学中也需要“两条腿走路”，但没有一条腿可以离开群众路线的。在科学研究中，要看近的，也要看远的，但远的利益和群众路线不是对立的。较长期的、有系统的研究，不是更需要也可能很好地发挥集体力量吗？
    建立起新的师生关系
    我们远不能以短短时间内所取得的教学和科学研究的成绩来衡量我们文教事业的深刻变化。我们必须看到整个教育事业的精神面貌根本改变了。举一例说，如师生之间平等、民主的关系的建立，也就说明了我们社会中人与人的关系发生了根本性的变化。新的师生关系，据我的体会，就是在政治上、学术上互相关怀、互相督促、互相帮助的社会主义教学相长的关系。师生在党领导下的同志式的团结，是教学和科学研究迅速取得成绩的重要保证，也是教师加速自我改造的一个重要途径。在政治挂帅的条件下，大大发展文教事业，使我们的上层建筑能够更好地为基础服务，已经不是十分困难的事情了。
    总理在报告中指出：“建立一支千万人的工人阶级知识分子队伍，是文教战线的一项伟大的历史任务。”我和其他文教工作者一样，要在这样光荣的工作中贡献出自己最大的力量，同时加速改造自己，成为千万人的工人阶级知识分子队伍中的一个尖兵。
