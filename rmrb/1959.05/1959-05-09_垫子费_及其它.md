　　"Cushion Fees" and Others
　　Dānzēng Jìnměi
    Panchen Erdeni Qoigyijabu, a representative of the National People's Congress, mentioned in his speech at the National People's Congress that the sinister aim of the reactionary upper strata of Tibet was "to once again place the Tibetan people under the enslavement of imperialism and to permanently preserve the darkest and most brutal serf system in the world." To what extent was the serf system in Tibet dark and brutal? Judging solely from the feudal rulers' extortion of the people, the number of pretexts they invented was truly staggering.
    For example, there are "Datui," "Santui," "Zatui," "Dantui," and "Labutui" in Tibetan. Translated into Chinese, they are horse fees, feed fees, grass fees, cushion fees, and Labu fees. These were all pretexts used by Tibetan local government officials to extort money along the way during business trips. To understand their meaning, one must start with the officials' business trips.
    Tibetan officials traveled on horseback. Generally speaking, horses were provided by the common people without compensation, station after station. Some officials rode their own horses on business trips, but at each station, the common people still had to give the official a "Datui," the "reason" being: you didn't ride my horse, you must give me "horse fees!"
    When officials arrived at a place on horseback, if it was summer, they would put the horse on the mountain to eat grass, but they still had to ask the common people for a "Santui," the "reason" being: it didn't eat your horse feed, you have to give me "feed fees!" If it was winter, the officials would ask the common people to bring grass to feed the horse. Of course, there would be no grass in winter, so this was a "Zatui." After eating the common people's hay, they also had to take away "grass fees."
    When officials rested or stayed at a station, if the cushion they sat on was not good enough, they would be furious and demand satin cushions. How could the peasants in the countryside have satin cushions? This was simply a "Dantui" – "cushion fees." They sat on the cushions of the common people and demanded that the owner give them cushion fees! In addition, there was a silk umbrella-like thing called "Labure" on the ceiling above the official's head. If the official was asked to stay in a house without this "Labure," he would have to add a "Labutui," which was the "Labure fee."
    Of course, these horse fees, feed fees, grass fees, cushion fees, "Labure fees," etc., were by no means the prices for renting horses or buying grass. They could ask for as much as they pleased, and you had to give it to them.

　　“垫子费”及其它
　　旦增晋美
    全国人民代表大会代表班禅额尔德尼·却吉坚赞在全国人民代表大会上发言中提到，西藏上层反动集团的罪恶目的是“把西藏人民重新置于帝国主义的奴役之下，并且永远保存世界上最黑暗、最残酷的农奴制度”。西藏的农奴制度，黑暗与残酷到了一种什么地步呢？仅从封建统治者对人民的敲诈勒索方面来讲，巧立名目之多，说起来实在是惊人的。
    例如藏语所说的“达堆”、“散堆”、“杂堆”、“胆堆”、“拉卜堆”等。译成汉语就是马费、料费、草费、垫子费、拉卜费，这些都是西藏地方政府官员出差时一路敲诈勒索的名目。要懂得它们的含义，还得从官员出差讲起。
    西藏官员出差都是骑马的。一般地说，马由老百姓无代价供给，一站一站的送。有的官员出差骑自己的马，但每到一站，老百姓还必须给官员一笔“达堆”，“理由”是：没有骑你的马，必须给我“马费”！
    官员骑马到了一个地方。如果是夏天，就把马放到山上去吃青草，但还得向老百姓要一笔“散堆”，“理由”是：没有吃你马料，得给我“料费”！要是冬天的话，官员们便叫老百姓拿青草来喂马，当然，冬天是不会有青草的，这儿是要一笔“杂堆”。吃了老百姓的干草，还得带走一笔“青草费”。
    官员们到一站休息或住下时，如果坐的垫子不太好，就会大发雷霆，叫拿出缎子垫子来，乡下老百姓哪儿会有缎子垫子呢？这儿无非是要一笔“胆堆”——“垫子费”罢了。坐在老百姓的垫子上，反而叫主人给他一笔垫子费！此外官员坐的头顶的天花板上，要有一个绸子作的四方伞样的东西，名叫“拉卜热”，如果叫官员住没有这种“拉卜热”的房子，还得另外加上一笔名叫“拉卜堆”的“拉卜热费”。
    当然，这些马费、料费、草费、垫子费、“拉卜热费”等，绝不会是什么租马、买草等的价格，他们高兴要多少就得给多少。
