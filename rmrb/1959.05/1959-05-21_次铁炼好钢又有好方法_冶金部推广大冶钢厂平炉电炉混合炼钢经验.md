Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, May 20th: The Daye Steel Plant has successfully carried out a mixed steelmaking desulfurization experiment using electric furnace slag and open-hearth steel. This new method of electric furnace and open-hearth mixed steelmaking can increase the output of high-quality open-hearth steel, and provides another viable method for making good steel from high-sulfur iron. From May 9th to 12th, the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry held an on-site experience exchange meeting at the Daye Steel Plant to specifically introduce and promote Daye Steel Plant's experience in mixed open-hearth and electric furnace steelmaking through discussions and on-site demonstrations.

The method of mixed steelmaking using electric furnace slag and open-hearth steel was successfully tested by the Daye Steel Plant in April of this year. During this on-site meeting, representatives from various regions, after repeated experiments and appraisals, affirmed that the electric furnace and open-hearth mixed steelmaking method has five major advantages: First, it can improve product quality. The results of 38 open-hearth furnace trials at Daye Steel Plant showed that the average sulfur content at the end of the charging process was 0.23%, and after treatment with electric furnace slag, high-quality carbon structural steel with a sulfur content of 0.045% could be produced. Second, it can greatly increase production. Daye Steel Plant has proven through multiple experiments that the smelting time per furnace of steel is shortened by about one hour compared to ordinary steelmaking methods, and the production rate is increased by an average of 7.6%. Third, it can overcome the limitations of high-sulfur pig iron and transform large quantities of high-sulfur pig iron into high-quality steel. The average desulfurization efficiency of the 38 furnaces of steel used for testing at Daye Steel Plant reached 52.3%. Fourth, it can greatly reduce the physical labor of workers. Before tapping the steel, workers only need to reduce the sulfur content in the steel to 0.09%, and a strong mixing with electric furnace slag during tapping can produce high-quality steel with a sulfur content of 0.045%. Fifth, it can greatly save valuable alloy element materials.

Representatives from more than ten units, including Shanghai, Chongqing, Taiyuan Iron and Steel Companies, and Tianjin Steel Plant, who participated in this on-site experience exchange meeting, unanimously agreed that Daye Steel Plant's mixed steelmaking experience is practical and feasible, and is an effective method for open-hearth furnaces to further improve steel quality and produce more high-quality steel. They also expressed their intention to earnestly learn and promote this advanced experience of Daye Steel Plant.

    次铁炼好钢又有好方法
    冶金部推广大冶钢厂平炉电炉混合炼钢经验
    新华社武汉20日电　大冶钢厂用电炉渣同平炉钢水进行混合炼钢脱硫试验获得成功。这种电炉平炉混合炼钢的新方法，可以提高平炉优质钢的产量，为用高硫铁炼好钢又找到了一个可用的方法。5月9日到12日，冶金工业部在大冶钢厂召开了现场经验交流会，通过座谈和现场表演，具体介绍和推广了大冶钢厂采用平炉同电炉混合炼钢的经验。
    用电炉渣同平炉钢水进行混合炼钢的方法，是大冶钢厂在今年4月份试验成功的。在这次现场会议期间，各地代表经过反复试验和鉴定，肯定了电炉同平炉混合炼钢方法有五大优越性：第一，能提高产品质量。大冶钢厂平炉试验三十八炉的结果是：炉料化完时含硫平均在0.23％，经过电炉渣处理后，可炼出含硫在0.045％的炭素优质结构钢。第二，能大大提高产量。大冶钢厂通过多次试验证明，每炉钢的冶炼时间要比用一般炼钢方法缩短一小时左右，生产率平均提高7.6％。第三，可以不受高硫生铁的限制，能够将大量的高硫生铁变为优质钢。大冶钢厂用以试验的三十八炉钢的脱硫效率，平均达到52.3％。第四，可以大大减轻工人体力劳动。工人在出钢之前，只需要把钢水中的含硫量降到0.09％，在出钢时同电炉渣实行强烈的混合，就可以炼出含硫量在0.045％的优质钢。第五，可以大大节约贵重的合金元素材料。
    参加这次现场经验交流会议的上海、重庆、太原钢铁公司和天津钢厂等十多个单位的代表一致认为，大冶钢厂混合炼钢的经验，是切实可行的，是目前平炉进一步改善钢的质量，多产优质钢的有效方法，并且表示要认真学习和推广大冶钢厂这一先进经验。
