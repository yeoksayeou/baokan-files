Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, May 13th: The First Secretary of the German Communist Party, Max Reimann, delivered a letter yesterday via the "German 904 Free Radio Station" regarding the Geneva Foreign Ministers Conference.

In his letter, Reimann pointed out that the policy adopted by Adenauer, Brentano, and the German militarists who are with them, of obstructing the progress of the Geneva Conference, is against the interests of the German people. They have pronounced judgment on themselves with their disgraceful attitude in Geneva, and have incurred everyone's ridicule. Reimann said that the German Communist Party declares to the world that the German nation is not Adenauer, Brentano, and the German militarists. The German nation wants peace and relaxation of the situation. It wants to conclude a peace treaty and to achieve Germany's reunification in national independence.

Reimann called on the West German people to show the world that the West German working class and the vast majority of the people are not walking with Adenauer and Brentano, but hope that the foreign ministers will reach an understanding and peacefully resolve the German question through a peace treaty.

Reimann concluded by saying that the outcome of the East-West conference depends to a large extent on how the working class, standing at the forefront of the peace-loving people of West Germany, fights against militarism and atomic armament, and how they now express their desire for peace and a relaxation of the situation. He said, let every Communist, Social Democrat, and honest person fulfill their responsibility in striving for the success of the Geneva Conference.

    德共第一书记雷曼号召西德人民
    起来争取日内瓦外长会议成功
    谴责阿登纳之流阻挠日内瓦会议
    新华社柏林13日电  德国共产党第一书记马克斯·雷曼昨天通过“德国九○四自由广播电台”就日内瓦外长会议发表一封信件。
    雷曼在信中指出，阿登纳、勃伦塔诺以及同他们在一起的德国军国主义分子所采取的阻挠日内瓦会议进展的政策是违背德国人民的利益的，他们用他们在日内瓦的不光采的态度对自己作了宣判，并且招致了大家的嘲笑。雷曼说，德国共产党向全世界宣告，德意志民族不是阿登纳、勃伦塔诺和德国军国主义分子。德意志民族要和平和缓和局势。它要缔结和约，要在民族独立中实现德国的重新统一。
    雷曼号召西德人民向全世界表明，西德工人阶级和绝大多数人民并没有同阿登纳和勃伦塔诺一道走，而是希望外长们达成谅解以及通过和约和平解决德国问题。
    雷曼最后说，东、西方会议的结果在很大程度上取决于站在西德爱好和平的人民的前列的工人阶级怎样为反对军国主义和原子武装而斗争，以及他们现在怎样表示他们的要求和平和缓和局势的愿望。他说，让每一个共产党人、社会民主党人和正直的人在争取日内瓦会议成功方面尽自己的责任。
