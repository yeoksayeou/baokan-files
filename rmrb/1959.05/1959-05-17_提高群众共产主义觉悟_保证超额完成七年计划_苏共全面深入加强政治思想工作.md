    Moscow Dispatch from our Newspaper, 16th: The Soviet Communist Party organizations at all levels are carrying out comprehensive and in-depth work in further strengthening and improving political and ideological education for the masses. The basic tasks of the party organizations in various regions for ideological education of the masses during the current stage and for a considerable period in the future are to enhance the communist ideological consciousness of the masses by publicizing and explaining Comrade Khrushchev's report at the 21st Congress of the CPSU and the various resolutions and documents of the Congress, and to cultivate new people with a high sense of collectivism, love of labor, and noble communist morality and internationalism and patriotism, in order to mobilize the whole nation to actively complete and overfulfill the Seven-Year Plan—the grand program of communist construction.

    Since the 21st Congress of the CPSU to the present, enterprises, collective farms, institutions, and schools throughout the Soviet Union have been deeply studying the documents of the Congress. Various republics have held meetings specifically to study the issue of publicizing the documents of the 21st Congress. Tens of thousands of reporters and propagandists went to the grassroots to publicize and explain the documents of the Party Congress to the masses. For example, the Party organization of the Azerbaijan Republic sent more than 60,000 propagandists to the grassroots party organizations. The forms of political and ideological work among the masses are lively and diverse, including reports, seminars, discussions, Q&A sessions, and cultural universities, and extensively utilizing tools such as newspapers, television, radio, and movies. The central content of various propaganda efforts is to explain to the masses what communism is in connection with the Seven-Year Plan, as well as the material and spiritual conditions that must be met to achieve communism in the Soviet Union. Because the party organizations' political and ideological work is closely linked to reality, a very active atmosphere of creative labor has emerged in many enterprises and units while studying the documents of the Party Congress. The masses not only generally understand the significance and figures of the Seven-Year Plan, but also deeply know how their own enterprises and collective farms should tap internal potential and complete the Seven-Year Plan ahead of schedule. After studying the documents, many factory workers have set their own targets for completing the 1959 production plan and learning plan ahead of schedule. Leading cadres personally grasping political and ideological work has achieved very good results. The director, workshop directors, and engineers of the Moscow Ilyich factory personally participated in the propaganda work of the Party Congress documents, and mobilized the workers to formulate plans for each workshop and each section based on the factory's Seven-Year Plan, and also displayed them with charts. In enterprises that carry out ideological work so closely connected with the masses and with reality, the enthusiasm of the masses is particularly high.

    While conducting in-depth ideological work, the Party organizations pay great attention to supporting the various initiative spirits of the masses, so that the workers are most vividly and concretely educated in communist ideology through the movement to strive for the titles of "Communist Labor Brigades" and "Communist Labor Shock Workers." The slogan of "working and living in the communist way" has become the most distinct banner for ideological education of the masses. Enterprise and collective farm party organizations also use forms such as regular production meetings and production technology meetings in enterprises, worker congresses, and collective farm member congresses to inspire and attract the broad masses of working people to consciously and victoriously realize the Seven-Year Plan. Through consultation and discussion, the working people put forward various suggestions on production and conduct self-education by exchanging opinions.

    提高群众共产主义觉悟　保证超额完成七年计划
    苏共全面深入加强政治思想工作
    本报莫斯科16日电　苏联共产党各级党组织在进一步加强和提高对群众的政治思想教育工作方面，正在进行全面深入的工作。现阶段和今后相当长的一个时期内，各地党组织对群众的思想教育工作的基本任务是，通过宣传和解说赫鲁晓夫同志在苏共第二十一次代表大会的报告和代表大会各项决议与文件来提高群众的共产主义思想觉悟，培养具有高度集体主义精神、爱好劳动以及具备崇高共产主义道德和国际主义与爱国主义精神的新人，以便动员全民积极完成和超额完成七年计划——共产主义建设的宏伟纲领。
    苏共第二十一次代表大会以后到目前这一时期，全苏各地企业、农庄、机关、学校都在深入学习代表大会文件。各共和国都召开了会议，专门研究了宣传二十一大文件问题。成千上万的报告员和宣传鼓动员，到基层去向群众宣传和解说党代表大会文件，例如阿塞拜疆共和国党组织派了六万多名宣传员到基层党组织去。在群众中进行政治思想工作的形式，是生动多样的，有报告、座谈、讨论、解答问题会、文化大学，此外广泛利用报刊、电视、无线电、电影等工具。在多种宣传中贯彻的中心内容，是联系七年计划向群众说明什么是共产主义，以及在苏联实现共产主义必须具备的物质和精神条件。由于党组织的政治思想工作密切联系实际，许多企业单位在学习党代表大会文件的同时，就出现了一片十分活跃的创造性劳动的气氛。群众不但一般了解了七年计划意义和数字，而且还深刻地知道他们本企业、本农庄应如何来发掘内部潜力，提前完成七年计划。许多工厂工人在学习文件后，都纷纷订出自己提前完成1959年生产计划指标和学习计划。领导干部亲自抓政治思想工作获得很好的效果。莫斯科伊里奇工厂厂长、车间主任、工程师都亲自参加党代表大会文件宣传工作，并发动职工们根据全厂的七年计划订出每一车间、每一工段的计划，还用图表展示出来。像这样密切联系群众、联系实际进行思想工作的企业里，群众的干劲都特别大。
    党组织在深入进行思想工作时，十分注意支持群众各种主动精神，使职工通过争取“共产主义劳动工作队”和“共产主义劳动突击手”称号的运动受到最生动、具体的共产主义思想教育。“按照共产主义方式劳动和生活”的口号，已成为对群众进行思想教育最鲜明的旗帜。企业和农庄党组织还利用企业中的经常生产会议和生产技术会议、工人大会以及农庄中的庄员大会等形式，来启发吸引广大劳动人民自觉地胜利实现七年计划。劳动人民通过商量和讨论对生产提出各种建议，互相提意见进行自我教育。
