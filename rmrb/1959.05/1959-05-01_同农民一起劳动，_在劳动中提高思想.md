Comrades and Representatives:

I fully endorse Premier Zhou's government work report and the various reports of Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, as well as Vice Chairman Peng Zhen. I am committed to resolutely implementing them in my future work.

Now, I would like to report to the assembly on my experiences and understanding gained from participating in this rectification of the People's Communes.

Through rectification, the commune system has become more sound, members are more fond of the commune, and production enthusiasm is greater.

This time, our participation in the rectification work was organized by the Chongqing Municipal People's Political Consultative Conference, based on the study of the documents of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party. The group consisted of members of various democratic parties, non-party democrats, industrialists, businessmen, university professors, engineers, and primary and secondary school principals, totaling 109 people. On January 8th of this year, we formed the "Study Group for Participating in the Rectification of People's Communes" and went to Yudongxi People's Commune in Ba County, Chongqing, to assist in the rectification work.

Thanks to the correct leadership of the Chongqing Municipal Party Committee, the Ba County Party Committee, and the Party organizations at all levels of the commune, as well as the multifaceted care in life and the support and assistance of the broad masses of commune members, we continuously improved our awareness through work and study, dispelled various ideological concerns, and consistently adhered to the principle of eating, living, and laboring with the farmers, as well as ensuring that work, labor, and study were not neglected. Together with the local cadres, we thoroughly mobilized the masses, took socialist and communist ideological education as the key link, focused on production, and conducted rectification work closely around production.

In terms of production, we assisted commune cadres in strengthening the field management of the small spring crops, grasping the spring plowing work, vigorously promoting the fertilizer accumulation campaign, improving labor organization, extensively publicizing the policy of "less planting, high yield, more harvesting," and the "Eight-Point Charter" for agriculture. We earnestly implemented the technical specifications for major spring crops issued by the county Party committee. In terms of living welfare, we focused on assisting in the improvement and consolidation of public canteens, kindergartens, and nurseries. Under the leadership of the Party organizations at all levels of the commune, we assisted in mobilizing commune members to conduct airing of views, debates, and, in conjunction with the inspection and evaluation of production labor, carried out socialist and communist ideological education, especially publicizing the central government's rectification work policies, ensuring that they were known to every household and deeply rooted in people's hearts. On this basis, we carried out contracting work and output quotas, established and improved the production responsibility system, and handled specific problems according to policies and guidelines. Through the above work, the production enthusiasm of cadres and commune members has been greatly mobilized. Currently, a new upsurge of strengthening the late-stage management of small spring crops and carrying out a shock campaign for major spring production is being launched.

First of all, because after the devolution of power, everyone clarified that the production team is the foundation, and they have greater initiative in arranging production; because of unified leadership, hierarchical management, material and labor, equivalent exchange, overcoming the idea of "fear of suffering losses" and the egalitarian idea of relying on the commune's large collective, each production team is generally more active in their own production plans and production leadership. For example, after listening to the report of the four-level cadre meeting, some captains rushed back to their teams overnight to arrange production. The sugarcane task, which had not been arranged for a long time, was immediately arranged and the sugarcane seeds were transported back overnight and planted. The teams competed to ask the management area for tasks and immediately took action, implementing planting sorghum, millet, and vegetables wherever possible. They also became active in developing sideline occupations, formulating leaping plans for developing the production of pigs, cattle, and small poultry, sweeping away the negative emotions of worrying about lack of feed, lack of pigsties, and delaying mating after the estrus of female animals in the past. The female animals of each team have been successively and systematically mated.

Secondly, the broad masses of commune members showed universal concern for production management and launched a shock campaign for major spring production with soaring enthusiasm. When a commune member saw that the seedlings in his management responsibility area were suffering from insect pests, he immediately reported to the captain and carried back pesticides to spray. A sixteen-year-old kindergarten teacher firmly ran the children's canteen. From carrying vegetables and rice to taking care of thirty-nine children to eat well, she was entirely responsible for it alone. Someone asked her: "Isn't it too tiring?" She replied: "No, I'm calling on all the children in the team to eat well, which also means that all the mothers in the team can eat well after work. If I do a good job in taking care of the children, it is equivalent to doing a good job in production."

Due to the policy of distribution according to work, more work, more pay, and more retention for more harvest, which is suitable for the current level of production development of the commune and the consciousness of the commune members, the personal interests of the broad masses of commune members are more closely combined with the collective interests of the commune, which has further stimulated the production enthusiasm of the commune members and boosted their soaring enthusiasm. Many commune members automatically requested to implement hard work during the shock campaign for major spring crops, rushing to harvest and rush to plant, implementing going to work early and leaving work late. Many people often automatically ran to the branch office to ask: "Will there be overtime tonight?" The labor attendance rate of many teams reached one hundred percent. Cooks, feeders, and nannies not only completed their own job tasks every day, but also squeezed time to go up the hill to engage in agricultural production, often appearing the scene of "four staff members meeting" (that is, cooks, feeders, nannies and production fighters working together). In the recent shock campaign for major spring crops, rushing to plant and rush to transplant, there has emerged a new upsurge of "men, women, old and young go to the front line, working hard day and night to ensure a bumper harvest." Commune member Zhu Dagan's words express the general mood of the broad masses of commune members. He said: "Chairman Mao's words have penetrated into our hearts! He really seems to have seen our hearts. We must redouble our efforts to ensure a great leap forward in production to repay the chairman's concern for us."

Third, commune members cherish the public property of the commune even more. Before the rectification policy was conveyed, some commune members often did not cherish large and small farm tools enough. Now, because it is clear that the team is the foundation and each accounts for profits and losses, the collectivist thinking of commune members has been strengthened, and they universally and actively cherish the public property of the commune.

In short, through the above series of work, the problems that were not resolved in the early stage of the establishment of the commune regarding production, distribution, living welfare, and operation and management have been resolved one by one. The system of the commune has become more sound, the commune members love the commune even more, their mood is more cheerful, and the enthusiasm for production is also growing. The rectification work has powerfully promoted the comprehensive development and greater leap forward of the commune's production in 1959. In these three months of rectification work, we have become increasingly clear that the rectification policies are entirely based on the greatest interests of the people of the whole country and are formulated according to the laws of the development of the Chinese revolution and socialist construction. Therefore, although the work has not yet been completed, it has already shown remarkable results. We firmly believe that with the gradual deepening of the rectification work, the People's Commune will be further consolidated and developed, and this new social organization of the People's Commune will surely be able to show its unparalleled superiority and further demonstrate its strong vitality.

Around the Party's central task, participating in labor practice and social practice, strengthening self-remolding

Through more than three months of work, labor and study, I have the following insights:

First, through the rectification work, I have a relatively deep understanding of the superiority of the People's Commune, and thus support the People's Commune system even more.

Through commune members' airing of views and debates on the achievements of the Great Leap Forward in production in 1958, it was clarified that as soon as the commune was set up, a large-scale battle for steel was launched. If the commune was not established and the four modernizations (organizational militarization, action combatization, collective living, and democratic management) were not implemented, it would not be possible to complete such an arduous task, and it would not be possible to establish groups of indigenous and modern iron smelting furnaces on Jielong Mountain from scratch. When 60,000 to 70,000 people went up the mountain, due to the establishment of public canteens, kindergartens, and nurseries by the commune, women's labor was liberated, and women were able to go up the slopes and down the fields to carry out a shock campaign for the "four autumns," showing great talent and ensuring the unprecedented goodness of this year's small spring crops. These eloquent facts made me believe from the bottom of my heart that the commune was produced under the leadership of the Party, in the Great Leap Forward in production, was established at the request of the farmers themselves, and is a guarantee for a greater leap forward in agricultural production. At the same time, it is also the best form to accelerate the speed of socialist construction in our country and realize the two transitions.

In addition, I have gained a further understanding of the People's Commune's guidelines for developing production, and I support these guidelines even more. Yudongxi People's Commune ran iron and steel plants, Huangsha refractory material plants, Baipaoshi plants, coal plants, and tile plants on a large scale, developing diversified economies. In just over a month, the income has reached more than 300,000 yuan. This can solve the commune's half-year wages and management expenses. If it is all used to increase wages, each level can reach 9 yuan per month; if it is used in a unified way, it can quickly expand commune-run industry and expand the components of ownership by the whole people. Furthermore, in terms of grain production, the average yield per mu in the county in 1958 was 672 jin, and this year's contracted output of this commune is generally more than 1,700 jin per mu. Due to the good production leadership and the soaring enthusiasm of the masses, taking wheat alone as an example, Class I seedlings generally use 25 or 6 jin of seeds per mu. According to our yield measurement results, there are about 700,000 plants per mu, and each spike has about 60 grains. According to 18,000 grains per jin, the wheat yield per mu this year can reach more than 2,700 jin. Therefore, this year's large-area high yield of grain is completely certain. The total industrial and agricultural output value of this commune in 1959 is expected to reach 5,800 yuan per household on average, which is also completely achievable. These iron facts prove that the commune's development of production implements the correct policy of simultaneously promoting industry and agriculture, and the policy of developing diversified economies. At the same time, it also convincingly proves that only by communizing and breaking the boundaries of small cooperatives can the most rational use of funds and labor be achieved. Through the measurement of the yield of small spring crops, we have a personal experience of the policy of "less planting, high yield, and more harvesting" and the "Eight-Point Charter" for agriculture, and further consolidated the idea of a greater leap forward. Through the management of Class I seedlings, especially satellite fields - cherishing seedlings like children and managing them like embroidery - everyone saw the beautiful vision of farmland beautification and wholeheartedly supported the great plan of land landscaping proposed by Chairman Mao, wholeheartedly supported the People's Commune system, and yearned for the rapidly advancing countryside.

Second, through "three togethers" (eating together, living together, and working together), especially labor practice, our thoughts and feelings have also begun to change. In the "three togethers," the farmers' diligence, simplicity, and selfless spirit constantly moved us, changed our attitude towards labor, and corrected our past erroneous views that farmers were narrow-minded, selfish, and backward. For example, a member from a capitalist background wrote with emotion: "Digging soil for half a day, my waist aches and my back is sore. Only then did I know that every grain in the dish is the sweat of farmers. Recalling the time of exploitation, I feel ashamed. If I want to change my position, labor must come first." After hearing the vivid examples of farmers resolutely implementing the Party's call to rush to plant late sweet potatoes during the six major droughts in 1958, taking out their own floral quilts, tents, and floral clothes to cover the sweet potato seedlings, and participating in the farmers' hard work day and night, completing the task of accumulating 200,000 jin of fertilizer per household before the Spring Festival, which we thought could not be completed, everyone not only sincerely admired the farmers' great enthusiasm and high awareness, but was also deeply moved by the farmers' love for the Party and resolute obedience to the Party. Some comrades made a self-criticism, saying: "We are not as loving of the Party and obedient to the Party as the farmers. They do so much work for a few yuan a month, and we are not satisfied with so much money every month. This proves that we need to strengthen our remolding." Some checked with emotion the reason why he had not been able to write works since liberation: "It is not a problem of writing skills, but because the position has not been well transformed and the ideological emotions are not right." Thus strengthening the requirements for self-remolding.

Third, through this work, we also realized that focusing on the Party's central task and participating in labor practice and social practice is an effective way to strengthen self-remolding.

In social practice, by going deep into the grassroots and deep into the masses, it is easier to discover problems in our own positions, viewpoints, and ideologies, and it is also easier to put down our airs and, as ordinary laborers, eat, live, work, and labor together with the working people. In this way, we are gradually infected and influenced by the working people, and it is easier to understand the thoughts and feelings of the working people and learn from the working people. Every bit of progress will be encouraged and welcomed by the masses. In this way, it is relatively possible to accelerate the laborization of bourgeois intellectuals who have been separated from the masses and separated from labor for a long time. Secondly, only in social practice and labor practice can we better give play to our expertise. For example, a member who knew acupuncture trained 30 apprentices in more than two months, jointly diagnosed more than 10,000 person-times, which can be regarded as fully giving play to his expertise. If he had not participated in this rectification, his technology could not have been so widely combined with the masses to serve the masses. Several former military and political personnel have the technology of surveying and mapping military maps, and this time they fully played their role in surveying and mapping soil maps in the commune. Engineering and technical personnel participated in the physical labor of carrying burdens, deeply felt the importance of mechanization, and prompted them to use their brains to help the commune repair the pumping station and assist the agricultural machinery factory in carrying out the "three-five" movement. This enables people to appreciate the profound significance that theory must be combined with production practice and technology must be combined with the masses. The People's Commune is large and public, and its needs are multifaceted. As long as you have expertise, you have a broad field to use your talents. As long as you honestly think about the masses, you can get the full support of the masses. In the process of fully playing your expertise, bourgeois intellectuals will be more convinced of the truth that more remolding means more service, and that remolding and service are mutually reinforcing, thus strengthening the requirements for self-remolding. Again, because social practice is full of class struggle and the struggle of two ideologies, through labor practice, one can receive vivid class education and promote self-remolding. In this rectification work, the views on each problem and the handling of each task clearly reflect and test a person's political position and political views. In the process of work, one will naturally receive a lot of class education. For example, for the same problem of eating without money, landlords and rich peasants call it "not being full," well-to-do middle peasants have "many opinions," and poor and lower-middle peasants say "very good." How divergent are the views on a problem with different positions? This makes everyone realize how important the fundamental transformation of position and viewpoint is. At the same time, we also understand that we must treat problems with the method of class analysis. It can be seen that in social practice, it is easier to reflect a person's problems in position and viewpoint, and through practice, there are more opportunities for mutual assistance, so it may be more practical to solve them. This actual struggle is much more practical and effective for a bourgeois element and a bourgeois intellectual who needs to undergo fundamental remolding than simply studying documents.

Fellow representatives, through rectification work and study, our overall experience is: resolutely accepting the leadership of the Party is the guarantee for doing all work well. This time, the Chongqing Municipal Party Committee was very concerned about our work. Before we set off, they not only told us about the situation, guidelines, and policies; after arriving in Ba County, they gave us kind instructions at different stages. The Ba County Party Committee and the Commune Party Committee treated us as their own cadres, relied on and trusted us, absorbed us into various cadre meetings, and gave us various reports, explained policies, introduced the situation, and imparted experience, providing us with good working conditions and giving us multifaceted care in life. The Party also sent its own Party members to participate in the work and study of the group, and established a Party branch, so that the group headquarters had a leading core and a strong leadership force, ensuring the smooth progress of the group's work. Secondly, under the leadership of the Party, the democratic parties also played an organizational role. The Party branch convened Party joint meetings or expanded branch committee meetings at different stages, absorbing responsible comrades outside the Party to participate, study the situation, conduct consultations, and clarify tasks. Each democratic party also established temporary organizations within the group, often carrying out party activities (joint organizational life) around ensuring the group's tasks, carrying out criticism and self-criticism, and strengthening ideological work, so that its members could play a backbone role and the role of the Party's assistant. Again, the backbone role of all parties was brought into play, the working methods of the mass line were adhered to, and the active role of all parties was mobilized. All these activities reflect that the Party's leadership is the fundamental guarantee. Therefore, we deeply realize that resolutely accepting the leadership of the Party is the guarantee for doing all work well, and that bourgeois elements and bourgeois intellectuals conscientiously and consciously participating in social practice is an effective way to strengthen remolding.

Fellow representatives! Let us resolutely accept the leadership of the Party, hold high the red flag of the general line, redouble our soaring enthusiasm, and strive together to achieve a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in 1959!

    同农民一起劳动，
    在劳动中提高思想
    周钦岳代表的发言各位代表：
    我完全拥护周总理的政府工作报告和李富春、李先念副总理以及彭真副委员长的各项报告，并愿在今后工作中坚决贯彻执行。
    现在我就参加这次整顿人民公社工作的体会和认识向大会作一汇报。
    通过整社，公社制度更加健全，社员更加热爱公社，生产劲头更大了
    这次参加整社工作，是在学习党的八届六中全会文件的基础上，由重庆市政协组织的。参加整社的有各民主党派成员，无党派民主人士，有工商业者，大学教授，工程师，中小学校长等共一百零九人，于今年一月八日组成了
  “参加人民公社整社工作学习团”前往重庆市属巴县鱼洞溪人民公社协助整社工作。
    由于中共重庆市委、巴县县委和公社各级党组织的正确领导和生活上的多方照顾，以及广大社员的支持和帮助，我们通过工作与学习，不断提高自觉，解除了各种思想顾虑，始终坚持了与农民同食、同住、同劳动，和工作、劳动、学习三不误的原则，同当地干部一起，深入发动群众，以社会主义及共产主义思想教育为纲，以生产为中心，紧紧围绕生产，步步不离生产地进行整社工作。
    在生产方面，协助公社干部加强小春田间管理，抓紧春耕工作，大搞积肥运动和改进劳动组织，深入宣传“少种、高产、多收”的方针和农业“八字宪法”，认真贯彻了县委关于大春作物的技术规格。生活福利方面，着重协助改进、巩固了公共食堂、幼儿园和托儿所。在公社各级党组织领导下，协助发动社员，进行鸣放辩论，结合生产劳动的检查评比，进行了社会主义和共产主义的思想教育，特别是宣传了中央提出的整社工作方针，达到家喻户晓，深入人心，并在此基础上进行包工包产，建立健全生产责任制以及根据方针政策处理具体问题。通过上述工作，大大地调动了干部和社员群众的生产积极性，目前，正在掀起一个加强小春后期管理和突击大春生产的新高潮。
    首先，由于权力下放后，大家明确了生产队是基础，对生产的安排有了更大的主动性；
  由于统一领导，分级管理，物资劳力，等价交换，克服了“怕吃亏”的思想和依赖公社大集体的平均主义思想，各个生产队普遍对本队的生产计划和生产的领导更加积极了。如有的队长在刚听完四级干部会议的传达报告后，就连夜赶回队里安排生产，长期没有安排好的甘蔗任务，立刻安排就绪，连夜运回蔗种种上了。各队争着向管理区要任务，并且马上行动起来，实行见缝插针，多种高粱、小米和菜蔬。对发展副业也积极起来了，制订发展猪、牛、小家禽的生产跃进计划，一扫过去怕没饲料，怕没猪圈，母畜发情后迟迟不配的一些消极情绪，各队的母畜都先后有计划的配种了。
    其次，广大社员表现了对生产管理的普遍关心和以冲天干劲突击大春生产。有个社员，一见自己的管理责任区苗稼生了虫病，立刻向队长报告并且担回农药喷施。一个十六岁的幼儿园教养员，坚决办好儿童食堂，从担菜、担饭到照顾三十九个小孩吃好饭，完全由她一人担任。有人问她：“是不是太累了？”她回答说：“不，我叫全队的幼儿们吃好饭，也就是叫全队的妈妈们下工后能吃好饭。我作好了带娃儿的工作，就等于搞好了生产。”
    由于按劳分配，多劳多得，多收多留的方针，适合公社当前生产发展水平和社员的觉悟程度，广大社员的个人利益与公社的集体利益更加密切地结合起来，这就更加激发了社员们的生产积极性，鼓起了冲天的干劲。许多社员自动要求在突击大春、抢收、抢种时期，实行苦战，实行早上班、晚下班，很多人常常自动跑到分队部问：“今夜是否加班？”许多队的劳动出工率都达到百分之一百。炊事员、饲养员、教养员不但每天完成本身岗位工作，而且挤出时间上坡搞农业生产，常常出现“四员大会师”的局面（即炊事员、饲养员、教养员与生产战斗员共同劳动）。在最近突击大春抢种、抢栽中，出现了“男女老少上前线，日夜苦干保丰产”的新高潮。社员朱大乾的话道出了广大社员的普遍心情，他说：“毛主席的话钻进我们的心里面来了！他老人家硬是像看到了我们的心。我们一定要鼓足干劲，保证生产的大跃进，来报答主席对我们的关怀。”
    第三，社员更加爱护公社的公共财物了。整社方针传达以前，有些社员对大、小农具常常不够爱护。现在由于明确了队为基础和各计盈亏，社员的集体主义思想更加加强，对公社的公共财物，普遍主动地爱护了。
    总之，通过以上一系列工作，公社建立初期没有来得及解决的关于生产、分配、生活福利和经营管理等方面的问题都逐一解决了，公社的制度更加健全了，社员更加热爱公社，心情更加舒畅了，生产的干劲也越大了，整社工作有力地推动了一九五九年公社生产的全面发展和更大跃进。在这三个多月的整社工作中，我们越来越清楚地认识到整社的方针政策完全是从全国人民最大利益出发，根据中国革命和社会主义建设的发展规律而制定的。因此，工作虽然尚未完结，但已显示出卓著的成效来了。我们深信，随着整社工作的逐步深入，人民公社必将更加巩固和发展起来，人民公社这种新的社会组织，一定能够更加表现出它的无比优越性，进一步表现出它的强大生命力来。
    围绕党的中心任务，参加劳动实践和社会实践，加强自我改造
    通过三个多月的工作、劳动和学习，我有下面几点体会：
    一、通过整社工作，比较深刻地认识了人民公社的优越性，从而更加拥护人民公社的制度。
    通过社员鸣放辩论一九五八年生产大跃进的成就，明确了公社一搭起架子，就展开了为钢而战的大兵团作战，如果不是成立公社，不实行四化（组织军事化、行动战斗化、生活集体化、管理民主化），不可能完成这样艰巨的任务，就不可能从无到有地建立起接龙山上成群的土洋炼铁炉。当六、七万人上山后，由于公社成立了公共食堂、幼儿园、托儿所，解放了妇女劳动力，妇女才能上坡下田，突击“四秋”，大显身手，保证了今年小春作物的空前良好。这些雄辩的事实，使我从内心信服了公社是在党的领导下，在生产大跃进中产生的，是农民自己要求建立的，而又是农业生产更大跃进的保证。同时它又是加快我国社会主义建设速度，实现两个过渡的最好形式。
    此外，对人民公社发展生产的方针也有了进一步的体会，更加拥护这些方针。鱼洞溪人民公社大办炼铁厂、大办耐火材料的黄沙厂、白泡石厂、煤厂、瓦厂，发展多种经济，仅一个多月，收入已达三十余万。这可解决公社的半年工资和管理费开支，如全部用于提高工资，每一级每月可达九元；如统一起来使用，即可迅速扩大社办工业，扩大全民所有制成分。再从粮食生产来说，一九五八年全县平均亩产六百七十二斤，今年这个公社包产，一般亩产均在一千七百余斤以上。由于生产领导得好，群众干劲冲天，仅以小麦一项而论，一类苗一般每亩用种二十五、六斤，据我们测产结果，每亩有七十万株左右，每穗约六十粒，按一万八千粒为一斤计算，今年小麦亩产可达二千七百斤以上。因此，今年粮食的大面积高产是完全有把握的。这个公社一九五九年工农业总产值预计每户平均可达五千八百元，也是完全可以作到的。这些铁的事实证明，公社发展生产贯彻工农业同时并举的方针，发展多种经济的方针的正确。同时也令人信服地证明了只有公社化了，打破小社的界限，才能最合理的使用资金和劳动力。通过小春测产，对于“少种、高产、多收”的方针，和农业“八字宪法”，我们有了亲切的体会，进而巩固了更大跃进的思想。通过一类苗特别是卫星田的管理——爱苗如子女，管理如绣花，大家看到园田化的美丽远景，衷心地拥护毛主席提出的大地园林化的伟大规划，对人民公社制度衷心拥护了，对正在飞跃前进的农村产生了向往。
    二、通过“三同”（同吃、同住、同劳动），特别是劳动实践，我们的思想感情，也开始发生了变化。在“三同”中，农民的勤劳朴实和大公无私的精神，不断地感动我们，改变了我们对劳动的态度和过去认为农民狭隘、自私、落后的错误看法。例如一位资本家出身的成员感叹地写道：“挖了半天土，腰痛背又酸，才知盘中餐，粒粒农民汗，回忆剥削时，感愧实难堪，若要变立场，劳动要当先。”听到农民在一九五八年六次大抗旱中，坚决贯彻党的抢种晚红苕的号召，拿出自己的花被子、帐子、花衣服遮盖红苕秧的生动事例和参加了农民日夜苦战，春节前完成了我们认为不能完成的每户积肥二十万斤的任务后，大家不仅由衷地佩服农民的干劲大，觉悟高，而且特别对农民那种热爱党，坚决听党的话这点深受感动。有的同志自我检查说：“我们不如农民热爱党，听党的话，他们一个月几元钱工资，做那么多工作，我们每月拿了这样多钱还不够满意，这就证明我们需要加强改造了”。有的感慨地检查出他解放以来之所以写不出作品的原因：“不是写作的技巧问题，而是由于立场没有改造好，思想情感不对头。”从而加强了自我改造的要求。
    三、通过这段工作，我们还体会到，围绕党的中心任务，参加劳动实践和社会实践，是加强自我改造的一条有效途径。
    我们在社会实践中，深入了基层，深入了群众，就比较容易发现自己的立场观点和思想意识问题，也就比较容易放下架子，以一个普通劳动者的身份与劳动人民同吃、同住、同劳动、同工作，这样，逐渐受到劳动人民的感染熏陶，就比较容易了解劳动人民的思想感情，向劳动人民学习，每一分进步，都会受到群众的鼓励和欢迎。这样，使长期脱离群众、脱离劳动的资产阶级知识分子，比较可以加速达到劳动化。其次，只有在社会实践和劳动实践中，才能更好地发挥专长。如一个会针灸的团员两个多月内培训了三十个徒弟，共同诊病一万多人次，可算是充分发挥了专长，如果不参加这次整社，他的技术不可能这么广泛地与群众结合为群众服务。几个旧军政人员有测绘军事地图的技术，这次在公社测绘土壤地图时，充分发挥了他们的作用。工程技术人员参加了担挑的体力劳动，深切地感觉到机械化的重要性，就推动他们开动脑筋，帮助公社修复了抽水站，协助农械厂开展了“三五”运动。这就使人们体会到理论必须与生产实际相结合，技术必须与群众相结合的深刻意义。人民公社又大又公，它的需要是多方面的，只要有所专长，你就有广阔的用武之地，只要老老实实为群众着想，就能得到群众的全力支持，而在充分发挥专长
  的过程中，资产阶级知识分子就会更加信服多一分改造，多一分服务，改造与服务二者互为作用的道理，从而也就加强了自我改造的要求。再次，由于社会实践中，充满着阶级斗争和两种思想的斗争，通过劳动实践，就可以受到生动的阶级教育，推动自我改造。这次整社工作中，对每个问题的看法，对每一项工作的处理，都鲜明的反映和考验着一个人的政治立场和政治观点，而在工作的过程中，自然也就受到不少的阶级教育，如同样一个吃饭不要钱的问题，地主富农就叫“吃不饱”，富裕中农就“意见多”，贫雇农就说“好得很”。立场不同，对一个问题的看法是多么分歧，使大家认识到立场观点的根本改造是多么重要。同时也懂得了必须以阶级分析的方法对待问题。由此可见，在社会实践中，就比较容易反映一个人的立场观点上的问题，而通过实践彼此互助的机会多，就可能比较切实地得到解决。这种实际的斗争，对于一个需要进行根本改造的资产阶级分子和资产阶级知识分子来说，比单纯学习文件，要实际得多，有效得多。
    各位代表，通过整社工作与学习，我们总的体会是：坚决接受党的领导是搞好一切工作的保证，这次重庆市委非常关怀我们的工作，出发前不但给我们讲形势、讲方针、讲政策；到巴县后，在不同阶段都给我们以亲切的指示，巴县县委和公社党委，把我们当成自己的干部依靠信任，吸收我们参加各种干部会议，并单独给我们作了各种报告，讲解政策，介绍情况，传授经验，为我们提供了很好的工作条件，并在生活上给予我们多方的照顾。党又派遣了自己的党员参加团的工作与学习，成立了党支部，使团部有了领导核心，有了坚强的领导力量，保证了全团工作顺利前进。其次，在党的领导下民主党派也发挥了组织作用，党支部在不同阶段都召开了党派联席会议或支委扩大会，吸收党外负责同志参加，研究情况，进行协商，明确任务，各民主党派并在团内建立了临时组织，经常围绕保证团的任务开展党派活动（联合组织生活），开展批评与自我批评，加强思想工作，使自己的成员发挥了骨干作用和党的助手作用。再次发挥了各方面的骨干作用，坚持了群众路线的工作方法，调动了各方面的积极作用。所有这些活动，都体现了党的领导是根本保证。因此，我们深刻体会坚决接受党的领导是作好一切工作的保证，而资产阶级分子和资产阶级知识分子认真地、自觉地参加社会实践，又是加强改造的一条有效途径。
    各位代表！让我们坚决接受党的领导，高举总路线红旗，鼓足冲天干劲，为实现一九五九年更大更好更全面的跃进而共同奋斗吧！
