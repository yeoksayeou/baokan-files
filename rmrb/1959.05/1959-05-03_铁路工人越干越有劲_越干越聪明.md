Railway Workers Become More Energetic and Smarter as They Work
Speech by Representative Li Yong

　　An old driver said: "Our railway workers are not afraid of large freight volumes. As soon as we see the freight yard piled high with goods that can't be moved fast enough, we are filled with energy again. Hook them up! Hook up as many as we can, haul as much as we can!"

　　Chairman, esteemed members:

　　I fully agree with and support the "Government Work Report" made by Premier Zhou Enlai, the reports made by Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, and the report by Vice Chairman Peng Zhen.

　　Our railway workers across the country fully support the State Council's order to dissolve the original Tibet local government and quell the rebellion in Tibet. The original Tibet local government and the upper-class reactionary clique colluded with imperialism and foreign reactionaries, tore up the seventeen-article agreement on the peaceful liberation of Tibet, and launched a counter-revolutionary rebellion betraying the motherland and splitting the unity of the motherland. This has aroused great anger among railway workers across the country.

　　Tibet has always been an inseparable part of Chinese territory. Quelling the rebellion of the reactionary elements in Tibet is China's internal affair, and no foreign country can interfere. The imperialists and Indian expansionists openly supported this rebellion, which shows that they harbor ulterior motives toward Tibet, our territory. The conspiracies of the imperialists and foreign reactionaries are bound to fail completely.

　　At present, under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, our railway workers across the country, along with the people of the whole country, are embarking on the Great Leap Forward, with one high tide following another. The four major indicators for 1959 have become a huge driving force, inspiring the vast number of workers to continuously leap forward. Although the contradiction of large freight volumes and small transport capacity that currently exists on the railways has not been completely resolved, based on the soaring enthusiasm of all railway workers, the completion of the state plan for 1959, which stipulates a transportation volume of 520 million tons, is guaranteed. An old driver said, "Our railway workers are not afraid of large freight volumes. As soon as we see the freight yard piled high with goods that can't be moved fast enough, we are filled with energy again. Hook them up! Hook up as many as we can, haul as much as we can!" This sentence reflects the opinions of the vast number of workers. Many veteran railway workers, who have worked on the railways for more than 30 years, have never seen so many goods as they do today in their experience. The increasing prosperity of our great motherland is clearly visible in the eyes of the workers. Therefore, the energy they are filled with is inexhaustible. Moreover, the more they work, the more energetic they become, and the smarter they become. Below, I will focus on the enthusiasm of the railway locomotive department workers.

　　Competing for Every Second, Not Yielding an Ounce

　　I recently visited the Shijiazhuang Locomotive Depot and saw that their red flag competition movement was in full swing, with monthly skill competitions and ten-day evaluations. When there were not enough locomotives, under the call of the Party, the train crews proposed the battle slogan of "competing for every second, not yielding an ounce," and launched a red flag competition to haul more, run faster, and be safe and punctual. For example, the section between Shijiazhuang and Yangquan is all mountainous, with a gradient of 18 per thousand downhill. One locomotive can only haul 650 tons. The workers proposed adding a helper locomotive in the high-gradient section, and starting in April, they hauled 950 tons, so one locomotive could do the work of one and a half. Between Shijiazhuang and Dezhou, the hauling quota is 3,200 tons. Some people thought that this was the limit. However, the crew of locomotive ㄇ3—2364 broke the superstition, dared to think and dared to do, and increased the load from 3,200 tons to 4,000 tons, and increased the technical speed from 40 kilometers to 44.8 kilometers. By promoting their advanced experience throughout the depot, they were able to free up an additional ten and a half locomotives from the existing fleet every day.

　　When equipment was insufficient, the workers launched a large-scale technical revolution to solve the problem. When there were not enough lathes, they built four indigenous lathes themselves. The lathe group launched a 600-point competition to improve the efficiency of the lathes (the 600-point competition meant doing 600 minutes of work in a 480-minute day). The workers combined the technical revolution with improvements to cutting tools and operating methods, significantly improving work efficiency. In March, the whole group averaged 748 points, increasing efficiency by 55.9 percent, which was equivalent to the whole group completing the workload for the first half of April in March. One worker, Zhao Ziying, completed a maximum of 1,868 points, averaging 1,141 points, increasing efficiency by 237.7 percent, which was equivalent to completing the tasks for April and the first ten days of May in March. This effectively accelerated the speed of locomotive repair. In the past, it took three days to prepare the parts needed for a locomotive's overhaul; now, one day is enough. The average overhaul time in January was 7.8 days, but in March, it was shortened to 2.5 days, creating technical conditions for the newly started locomotive overhaul and medium repair tasks.

　　Making What We Don't Have, Learning What We Don't Know

　　When there was not enough oxygen, the workers built an indigenous oxygen plant themselves. Most of them are workers with little education, but because they dare to think and dare to do, the deeds they have created are amazing. A young worker named Lei Changfa created a hydraulic sandblaster, which was promoted throughout the railway system. It not only increased work efficiency tenfold, but especially reduced the amount of dust released during sandblasting to far below the national standard (the national standard for dust content per cubic meter is two milligrams, and the standard was reduced to 0.03 milligrams).

　　The workers' enthusiasm is not only getting stronger and stronger, and more and more skillful, but also the communist spirit is increasing day by day. Many veteran workers have changed their rigid and stiff tempers in the Great Leap Forward, humbly learning from others and patiently teaching apprentices. They have great aspirations and propose to fight against difficulties, "making what we don't have, learning what we don't know." An old worker named Yang Lianchun, in order to learn how to build an oxygen plant, traveled from Hebei to Zhejiang, and from Zhejiang to the Northeast, not only not shirking hardship, but even refusing travel expenses. He said, "It's enough to be able to contribute a little more to socialist construction. What do I need travel expenses for?" I have found that in the minds of many veteran workers, there is nothing more pleasant than contributing one more ounce of strength to the construction of socialism. The problem they are thinking about is how to improve work efficiency, actively changing old working methods, emphasizing "convenience for others, convenience for oneself," and doing everything to be a good vanguard. A dozen or so types of workers in the locomotive depot revolve around the locomotive. Their work is interconnected. For example, locomotive crew, repair workers, and inspectors used to have endless disputes over the quality of locomotives. The crew would blame the repair workers for not repairing them well, the repair workers would blame the crew for not maintaining them well, and the inspector would be caught in the middle, with the repair workers saying he was nitpicking and the crew saying he was irresponsible. Solving this contradiction was very difficult.

　　In the Great Leap Forward, cadres participated in labor, workers participated in management, and large-scale cooperation was launched. The masses realized from their own actions that if the railway is to be a good pioneer, the primary task of the locomotive department workers is to improve the quality of locomotives in order to improve transportation efficiency, which can only be achieved through the efforts of everyone. The repair workers said: The labor of the entire depot's workers is expressed through the crew, so they must respond to the crew's requests regarding locomotive quality. The crew personally participate in locomotive repair to improve their ability to maintain and repair locomotives. The more thoroughly the inspector checks the locomotive, and the higher the requirements, the more welcome they are. This ended the historical disputes.

　　The vast number of workers have achieved a double harvest in work and thought in the Great Leap Forward, which has accelerated the training of new workers. At present, a large number of new workers are being added. When young workers enter the factory, veteran workers set a good example, learning advanced ideology, technology, and labor from their mentors, enabling the new workers to progress rapidly. A large number of apprentices, through hard study and practice, can repair locomotives with their mentors after only two months in the factory. This is a fast, efficient, and economical way to train new forces, which is conducive to the continuous leap forward of the railway cause.

　　At the same time, with the endless miracles created by the workers in their labor, a cultural upsurge has been set off, with everyone reading, everyone writing poetry, singing happily, and dancing joyfully, enriching the cultural life of the vast number of workers. In terms of material life, with the widespread employment of workers' families, major changes have also taken place. Economic conditions have improved, children have entered nurseries and received a good education, and the canteen is more convenient and better than home. Workers' lives are very comfortable, their political, technical, and cultural levels have been significantly improved, the incidence of diseases has gradually decreased, and productivity has increased day by day.

　　In order to welcome "May Day," the workers have launched a vigorous gift-giving movement. The workers say: Wherever the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao point, our actions can reach there.

　　As far as I can see, the workers of the entire railway system, under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, have unlimited potential, and the great leap forward in production will surely be carried out in depth.

### 铁路工人越干越有劲　越干越聪明

专栏：

    铁路工人越干越有劲　越干越聪明
    李永代表的发言
    一位老司机说：“咱们铁路工人不怕运量大，一看见货场里堆着拉不完的货物，满身上的劲又来了，挂吧，挂多少，拉多少！”主席、各位委员：
    我完全同意和拥护周恩来总理所作的“政府工作报告”和李富春、李先念二位副总理所作的报告以及彭真副委员长的报告。
    我们全国铁路职工完全拥护国务院关于解散原西藏地方政府和平定西藏叛乱的命令。原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团勾结帝国主义和外国反动派，撕毁和平解放西藏十七条协议，发动背叛祖国、分裂祖国统一的反革命叛乱。在全国铁路职工中引起了极大的愤怒。
    西藏历来就是中国领土不可分割的一部分，平定西藏反动分子的叛乱是中国人民的内政，任何外国不能干涉。帝国主义和印度扩张主义分子公开支持这次叛乱，说明他们对我国领土西藏抱有不可告人的目的。帝国主义和外国反动派的阴谋必然彻底失败。
    目前我们全国铁路职工，在党中央和毛主席领导下，随同全国人民掀起来的大跃进，一个高潮跟着一个高潮前进，一九五九年的四大指标，成为鼓舞广大职工不断跃进的巨大的动力。虽然当前铁路上存在的运量大、运能小的矛盾，还没有彻底解决，但是根据全路职工的冲天干劲，完成一九五九年国家计划规定的五亿二千万吨的运输量是有保证的。有一位老司机说：“咱们铁路工人不怕运量大，一看见货场里堆着拉不完的货物，满身上的劲又来了，挂吧，挂多少，拉多少！”这句话反映了广大职工的意见。很多老铁路工人，在铁路上干了三十多年，在他们的经历中，从来没有看见过象今天这样多的货物。我们伟大的祖国日益富强，在工人们的眼睛里是看的清清楚楚。因此，他们身上充满的干劲是永远用不完的。而且是越干劲越足，越干越聪明。下边我着重说说铁路机务部门职工的干劲。
    分秒必争　斤两不让
    我最近到过石家庄机务段，看到他们的红旗竞赛运动开展的轰轰烈烈，月月比武、旬旬评比。机车不够用，在党的号召下，乘务员们就提出：“分秒必争，斤两不让”的战斗口号，展开了多拉、快跑、安全正点的红旗竞赛。比如，石家庄到阳泉间，全是山区，下行有千分之十八的坡道，一台机车只能牵引六百五十吨，职工们提出来，在高坡区段加上补机，四月份开始就牵引了九百五十吨，这样一台机车就能顶一台半用；石家庄到德州间，牵引定数是三千二百吨，有的人就认为到限度了，但是，ㄇ3—2364号机车包乘组打破了迷信，敢想敢干，由三千二百吨提高到了四千吨，并且把技术速度由四十公里，提到了四十四点八公里。这样全段推广了他们的先进经验，每天就向现有的机车中多要出来十台半机车。
    设备不够用，工人们就大搞技术革命来解决。车床不足，自己就造出四台土洋结合的车床。车床组开展了六百分竞赛，提高车床的利用效率（六百分竞赛就是在一天四百八十分时间内，干出六百分钟的工作）。工人们结合着技术革命，改进刀具，改进操作方法，显著的提高了工作效率。三月份全组平均达到七百四十八分提高效率百分之五十五点九，等于全组在三月份就完成了四月上半月的工作量。其中一个工人叫赵子英，最高完成一千八百六十八分，他平均完成一千一百四十一分提高效率百分之二百三十七点七，等于在三月份就完成了四月和五月上旬的任务。这就有力的加速了修车速度。过去为架修机车配件需要三天时间，现在一天就够了。一月份架修时间平均七点八天，三月份就缩短到二点五天。并给新开始的机车大修、中修任务创造了技术条件。
    没有就造　不会就学
    氧气不够用，工人自己动手建造土洋结合的氧气厂。他们多数人都是学问不高的工人，但是由于敢想、敢做、创造出来的事迹是很惊人的。有位青年工人叫雷长发创造出来的水压吹砂器，推广了全路。不仅提高了工作效率十倍，特别是将吹砂时散发的含尘量，降低到国家标准以下很多很多（每立方公尺的含尘量国家标准二毫克，降低标准零点零三毫克）。
    职工的干劲不仅越干越足，越干越巧，而且共产主义风格也日益提高。很多老工人在大跃进中改变了古板、生硬的脾气，虚心向别人学习，耐心教徒弟。气魄很大提出向困难做斗争，“没有就造，不会就学”，有个老工人叫杨连春为了要学会建造氧气厂，从河北跑到浙江，从浙江跑到东北，不但不辞辛苦，连出差费都不要，他说：“能为社会主义建设多出一点力气就够了，要出差费做什么。”我发现很多老工人在他们的思想中没有比为建设社会主义多出一分力气更愉快的了。他们想的问题就是用什么方法提高工作效率。积极改变旧的工作方法，强调“与人方便，自己方便”，一切为了当好先行。机务段十几个工种都围着机车活动。工作是互相联动的，如机车乘务员、修车工人、验收员，过去他们之间为了机车质量问题，有吵不完的纠纷，乘务员怪修车工人修的不好，修车工人怪乘务员保养的不好，验收员两面受气，修车工人说他挑刺，乘务员说他工作不负责任。解决这个矛盾是非常伤脑筋的。
    在大跃进中，干部参加了劳动，工人参加了管理，展开了大协作，群众从他们自己的行动中认识到了，铁路要当好先行官，机务部门的工人首要任务只有提高机车质量，才能提高运输效率，这就要有全体的努力才能实现。修车工人说：全段职工的劳动，是要靠乘务员表达出去，因此对乘务员提出的有关机车质量的要求，一定做到有求必应。乘务员亲身参加修车，提高对机车维修和保养的能力。验收员对机车检查的越彻底，要求的越高，越受欢迎。这就把有历史性的纠纷结束了。
    广大职工群众在大跃进中获得了工作、思想双丰收。就加速了对新工人的培养。目前新工人大量的增加，青年工人进了工厂，老工人就给树立了良好的榜样，向师傅学习先进思想，学习技术、学习劳动，使新工人进步很快，有大批徒工经过苦学、苦练，进厂二个月就能跟着师傅修理火车头。这样多快好省地培养新生力量，是有助于铁路事业不停的向前跃进。
    同时随着职工在劳动中创造出的无穷的奇迹，又掀起了一个文化高潮，人人读书，人人写诗，欢乐歌唱，愉快的舞蹈，丰富了广大职工的文化生活。在物质生活方面，随着职工家属广泛的就业，也起了重大变化，经济条件宽裕了，儿童进入了托儿所，受到了良好的教育，食堂比家里又方便又好。职工生活很舒畅，政治、技术、文化水平有了显著提高，疾病率逐渐降低，生产率日益上升。
    为了迎接“五一”，职工又掀起了轰轰烈烈的献礼运动。工人们讲：党中央和毛主席指到那里，我们的行动就能达到那里。
    据我所见的，全路工人，在党和毛主席的领导下，有着无限的潜力，生产大跃进，一定能够深入的开展下去。
