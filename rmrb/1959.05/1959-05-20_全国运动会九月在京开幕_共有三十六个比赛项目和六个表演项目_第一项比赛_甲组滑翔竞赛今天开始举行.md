Xinhua News Agency, 19th – The person in charge of the Preparatory Committee for the First National Games, when introducing the work of the Preparatory Committee since its establishment to Xinhua reporters today, said that the Group A Gliding Competition and the preliminary rounds of football, basketball, volleyball, handball, baseball, and softball will begin successively in twenty cities across the country from late May and mid-June, according to plan. To prepare for participating in this Games, many provinces and cities across the country have already held or are about to hold provincial, municipal, and autonomous region games, promoting the development of mass sports activities in various places. In the games of many provinces and cities, many newcomers with good results have emerged, and various sports records of the provinces and cities have been broken in batches, some even breaking national records.

The person in charge of the Preparatory Committee said that the opening ceremony of the Games will be held in Beijing in September. This National Games will hold thirty-six competitive events and six demonstration events. Among them, except for thirty-four competitive events and five demonstration events that will be held successively in Beijing from August to September, the rowing competition will be held in Wuhan in late August, and the nautical multi-sport competition and the water motorcycle demonstration event will begin in Qingdao in early September. At present, the Preparatory Committee has begun a series of complex scheduling work such as the competition schedule and venue use of the Games.

The earthwork of the grandstands of the largest sports stadium of the National Games—the stadium in the eastern suburbs of Beijing that can accommodate 80,000 spectators—has been basically completed. The circular track of the bicycle velodrome newly built near the Beijing Gymnasium has been completed, and the grandstand project of the velodrome is expected to be completed around the end of May. The National Games' motorcycle circular highway racetrack and the racecourse are also under construction in the western and southwestern suburbs of Beijing, respectively.

The thirty-six competitive events of this National Games are: football, basketball, volleyball, table tennis, tennis, badminton, handball, baseball, women's softball, water polo, polo, track and field, road cycling, gymnastics, acrobatics, weightlifting, swimming, diving, rowing, martial arts, Chinese wrestling, archery, Chinese chess, Go, horse racing, steeplechase, shooting, motorcycle cross-country, motorcycle circular highway, radio transmitting and receiving, nautical multi-sport, nautical model, gliding, paragliding, parachute tower jumping, and aviation model, etc.

The six demonstration events are: velodrome cycling, fencing, international freestyle wrestling, international Greco-Roman wrestling, international chess, and water motorcycles, etc.

Xinhua News Agency, 19th – The earliest competition of the First National Games—the Group A Gliding Competition—has been decided to start in Beijing on May 20th. At present, a total of seventy-eight male and female athletes (including reserve members) from nineteen delegations across the country have all arrived at the Liangxiang China Aviation Sports Club in Beijing and have begun various preparations before the flight. This is more than double the number of people (thirty-two) who participated in the Group A gliding competition of the National Gliding and Parachuting Competition last year.

Due to the development of gliding sports and the improvement of technical level in the past year, this gliding competition not only has a large number of participants, but also the difficulty of the competition events is greater than last year. During this competition, athletes from all over the country will participate in six competitions including glider endurance flight, altitude gain flight, 50-kilometer round-trip speed flight, 100-kilometer fixed-point speed flight, 100-kilometer triangular route speed flight, and directional long-distance flight. The gliders they are piloting will fly far beyond the scope of the airport airspace, and the directional long-distance flight will even fly to places far away from Beijing. This is very different from last year's all competitions being held in the airspace above the airport.

The six competitions will be conducted in batches successively, including team competitions and individual competitions. In the team competition, each delegation calculates the scores of three athletes as the team's total score, and each athlete's score is also counted as the score of the individual competition, without holding a separate individual competition.

The athletes participating in this competition are very young, with those aged seventeen to twenty accounting for more than half. There are fifteen female athletes who will compete with male athletes, and no separate women's group competition will be held. Both male and female athletes will pilot high-performance single-seat advanced gliders for record-breaking purposes.

Among the nineteen delegations participating in this competition, the Chinese People's Liberation Army team and the Sichuan team are very strong. The other seventeen delegations are: Heilongjiang, Liaoning, Jilin, Hebei, Henan, Shaanxi, Shanxi, Shandong, Xinjiang, Gansu, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangsu, Jiangxi, Anhui, Beijing, and Shanghai teams.

The person in charge of this competition told Xinhua reporters that because the summer airflow in Beijing is relatively strong and suitable for holding gliding competitions, the Group A Gliding Competition of the First National Games is held in advance. The Group B Gliding Competition of the National Games (not for record-breaking) will still be held in September.

    全国运动会九月在京开幕
    共有三十六个比赛项目和六个表演项目
    第一项比赛——甲组滑翔竞赛今天开始举行
    新华社19日讯　第一届全国运动会筹备委员会的负责人，今天在对新华社记者介绍筹委会成立以来的工作情况时说，全运会的甲组滑翔竞赛和足球、篮球、排球、手球、棒球和垒球预赛，根据计划将从5月下旬和6月中旬陆续开始在全国二十个城市中举行。为了准备参加这次运动会，全国许多省、市都已经举行过或即将举行全省、市、自治区的运动会，通过这些运动会，推动了各地群众性体育活动的开展。在许多省、市的运动会中，涌现出了不少成绩良好的新手，各省、市的各项运动纪录也成批地被刷新，有的还打破了全国纪录。
    筹委会负责人说，运动大会的开幕式，将于9月间在北京举行。这次全运会将举行三十六项比赛和六项表演赛。其中，除三十四项比赛和五项表演赛都将从8月到9月先后在北京举行外，赛艇竞赛将于8月下旬在武汉举行，航海多项运动竞赛和水上摩托艇表演赛，都将从9月上旬开始在青岛举行。目前，筹委会已经着手运动会的竞赛日程、场地使用等一系列的复杂的编排工作。
    全运会最大的运动场——北京东郊能容纳八万观众的运动场的看台土方工程，已经基本完成。在北京体育馆附近新建的自行车赛车场的环形跑道，已经建成，赛车场的看台工程预计将在5月底左右完工。全运会的摩托车环行公路赛车场和赛马场，也分别在北京西郊和西南郊施工。
    这次全运会的三十六个比赛项目是：足球、篮球、排球、乒乓球、网球、羽毛球、手球、棒球、女子垒球、水球、马球、田径、公路自行车、体操、技巧、举重、游泳、跳水、赛艇、武术、中国式摔跤、射箭、中国象棋、围棋、赛马、障碍赛马、射击、摩托车越野、摩托车环行公路、无线电收发报、航海多项运动、航海模型、滑翔、飞机跳伞、伞塔跳伞、航空模型等。
    六个表演赛项目是：赛车场自行车、击剑、国际自由式摔跤、国际古典式摔跤、国际象棋、水上摩托艇等。
    新华社19日讯　第一届全国运动会最早开始的一项比赛——甲组滑翔竞赛，已经决定5月20日开始在北京举行。目前，来自全国各地共十九个代表队的七十八名男、女运动员（其中包括预备队员），已经全部到达北京良乡中国人民航空俱乐部，并且开始了飞行前的各项准备活动。这比去年参加全国滑翔、跳伞比赛甲组滑翔比赛的人数（三十二人），增加了一倍多。
    由于一年来滑翔运动的发展和技术水平的提高，这次滑翔竞赛不仅参加的人数多，竞赛项目的难度也比去年大。在这次竞赛期间，各地的运动员都将参加滑翔机续航时间飞行、升高高度飞行、五十公里往返竞速飞行、一百公里定点竞速飞行、一百公里三角航线竞速飞行和定向远航飞行等六项竞赛。他们驾驶的滑翔机，将远远地飞出飞机场上空的范围，其中定向远航甚至要飞到离北京很远的地方。这和去年全部竞赛项目都在飞机场上空进行大不相同。
    这次的六项竞赛将先后分批进行，有队际的比赛，也有个人比赛。在队际比赛中，每个代表队计算三名运动员的成绩为队的总分，其中每个运动员的成绩同时也算为个人比赛的成绩，而不再另外举行个人比赛。
    参加这次竞赛的运动员都很年轻，仅十七岁到二十岁的就占一半以上。运动员中有十五名是女的，她们将和男运动员一起比赛，也不单独举行女子组的比赛。男、女运动员都将驾驶性能良好的创纪录用的单座高级滑翔机。
    参加这次竞赛的十九个代表队中，中国人民解放军队和四川队的实力都很强。其他十七个代表队是：黑龙江、辽宁、吉林、河北、河南、陕西、山西、山东、新疆、甘肃、湖北、湖南、江苏、江西、安徽、北京和上海队。
    这次竞赛大会的负责人对新华社记者说，由于北京夏季气流比较强，适合举行滑翔竞赛，因此，第一届全运会的甲组滑翔竞赛提前举行。全运会的乙组滑翔竞赛（不是创纪录性的），仍将在9月间举行。
