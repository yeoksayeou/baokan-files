Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 7th: The Central Committee of the Japanese Communist Party (JCP) published a statement in the "Akahata" today, calling on all Japanese people to support the candidates of the Japanese Communist Party in the Councillor election to be held on June 2nd.

The statement pointed out that the Nobusuke Kishi government and the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, in order to realize their conspiracy to revise the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty" and amend the Japanese Constitution, are attempting to seize more than half or two-thirds of the seats in this Councillor election. The statement condemned the Kishi Nobusuke government and the Liberal Democratic Party for putting forward false election slogans, inciting anti-Soviet and anti-communist sentiment, and engaging in activities that violate election laws in order to realize the above-mentioned conspiracy.

The statement pointed out that behind the tactics adopted by the Nobusuke Kishi government and the Liberal Democratic Party lies a very dangerous conspiracy for the Japanese people, namely, to continue to place Japan in a subordinate position to the United States by revising the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," and to collude with the United States to establish an aggressive military alliance and revive Japanese militarism.

The statement said that the people of Japan and Asia will never forget the history of Nobusuke Kishi as a member of the Tojo Cabinet and a Class A war criminal. No matter what false election slogans his government and the Liberal Democratic Party put forward, they cannot deceive the people, nor can they conceal the corruption, degeneration, and treasonous politics of the Liberal Democratic Party.

The statement said that the Japanese Communist Party advocates abolishing the Japan-U.S. "Security Treaty," adopting a policy of peace and neutrality, stopping the conspiracy to antagonize China and create two Chinas, restoring diplomatic relations between Japan and China, and fully implementing the provisions of the Constitution relating to peace and democracy.

The statement pointed out that if the patriotic and democratic forces of Japan agree with these propositions of the Japanese Communist Party and take these propositions as a common program to unite and launch a struggle, then they will be able to defeat the Liberal Democratic Party.

In its statement, the Japanese Communist Party called on all Japanese people who desire peace, independence, democracy, and improved living standards to support the candidates nominated by the Communist Party and democratic forces in the Councillor election, and to actively engage in struggle to prevent the expansion of the Liberal Democratic Party forces that serve the interests of the United States and Japanese monopoly capital.

　　日共中央就参议员选举号召全体人民
    支持日共和民主力量候选人
    新华社7日讯　东京消息：日本共产党中央委员会干部会今天在“赤旗报”发表文告，号召全体日本人民在将于6月2日举行的参议员选举中支持日本共产党的候选人。
    文告指出，岸信介政府和执政的自由民主党为了实现修改日美“安全条约”和修改日本宪法的阴谋，企图在这次参议员选举中攫取半数以上或者三分之二以上的议席。文告谴责岸信介政府和自由民主党为实现上述阴谋而提出虚伪的竞选口号，煽动反苏、反共，并且进行违反选举法的活动。
    文告指出，在岸信介政府和自由民主党所采取的这种策略背后，隐藏着对日本人民说来非常危险的阴谋，即通过修改日美“安全条约”继续使日本处于从属于美国的地位，并且同美国互相勾结，建立侵略性军事同盟，复活日本军国主义。
    文告说，日本和亚洲人民绝不会忘记岸信介曾经是东条内阁阁员和甲级战犯的历史。不论他的政府和自由民主党提出怎样虚伪的选举口号也骗不了人民，并且掩盖不了自由民主党的贪污、腐败和卖国的政治。
    文告说，日本共产党主张废除日美“安全条约”，采取和平中立的政策，停止敌视中国和制造两个中国的阴谋，恢复日中邦交，完全实施宪法中有关和平与民主的条款。
    文告指出，如果日本爱国民主力量同意日本共产党的这些主张，并且把这些主张作为共同的纲领，团结一致地展开斗争，那么，它们将有可能战胜自由民主党。
    日本共产党在文告中号召要求和平、独立、民主和提高生活水平的所有日本人民在参议员选举中支持共产党和民主力量提出的候选人，并且积极进行斗争，阻止为美国和日本垄断资本服务的自由民主党的势力的扩张。
