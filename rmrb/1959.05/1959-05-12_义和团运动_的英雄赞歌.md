Heroic Eulogy of the "Boxer Movement"
Wei Gang

From April of last year to February of this year, I have successively seen nearly thirty legends and stories of the Boxer Rebellion in "Folk Literature." These legends and stories can be roughly divided into two categories. One category is the highly imaginative, treasure-robbing type of story, such as "Little Yellow Cow," "Fishing Boy," and "White Hen"; the other category is mostly stories that directly reflect the struggle of the Boxer Rebellion, with a strong sense of reality. Of course, these stories also have a strong romantic color.

These stories are a true history of the people's anti-imperialist and anti-feudal struggle. They reflect the situation of the Chinese people around 1900, who, under the oppression and exploitation of the ruling class, were already in dire straits and living in misery. Coupled with the invasion of imperialism, with its looting, burning, killing, and raping everywhere, the people could no longer endure it. In order to survive, the people launched a bloody struggle against imperialism and the feudal ruling class. The Boxer Rebellion burned like wildfire throughout North China. Due to the invasion of imperialism, national contradictions overwhelmed everything, so it can be seen from these stories that the main target of the movement at that time was imperialism. However, in the struggle, the people gradually recognized the true face of the so-called government officials - they were lackeys of imperialism. These stories profoundly and painfully depict the ferocity of the imperialists and their lackeys, and give a pungent satire and merciless exposure to the corrupt and stupid bureaucrats and landlords. The ruling class succumbed to imperialism, but was extremely vicious towards the people, extorting and levying without doing anything. It was truly "like combing with a comb when the bandits come, and like shaving with a razor when the officials come!" The corrupt Qing government was indeed more hateful than bandits and robbers in the eyes of the people. Through the exposure of imperialism and the ruling class, these stories also vividly demonstrated that the Boxer Rebellion was a result of "officials forcing the people to rebel," showing the people's heroic and unyielding revolutionary spirit, and demonstrating the people's high patriotic enthusiasm.

These stories reflect the Boxer Rebellion deeply and widely, reflecting the thoughts and actions of almost all social classes in the movement. It quite profoundly demonstrates the collusion between imperialism, the ruling class, landlords, bullies, and "second devils" (a derogatory term for Chinese collaborators). Landlords, bullies, and "second devils" were the scum of the nation and the dregs of humanity. Some succumbed to imperialism, while others wanted to use the Boxer Rebellion to protect themselves, so they tried to seize control of the group (Liang San's seizure of the group), and if they failed to seize control, they tried to sabotage it (such as "Big Salt Water and Second Salt Water," "Chopping Ma Erye"), while some directly informed the foreign devils. These scum of course eventually received the punishment of the people. Landlords, bullies, and "second devils" were often a trinity, colluding with officials and foreign powers, standing on the heads of the people and doing everything possible to be tyrannical. It is not difficult to understand why the Boxer Rebellion was able to spread like wildfire throughout North China. In these stories, not only is the ferocious face of the rulers deeply exposed, but the ugliness of the social scum in the Boxer Rebellion is also widely revealed. For example, Wang San, the speculative merchant in "Wang San Makes a Fortune," is depicted quite profoundly. When the people were engaged in a life-and-death struggle with imperialism and government soldiers, he first flattered the foreign devils, but his foreign masters did not appreciate it. After the people defeated the foreign devils, he used the government soldiers to plunder the people, and when the Boxers came, he let the Boxers fight with the government soldiers, and he himself swallowed the profits alone. The words, deeds, smiles, and psychological activities of the speculative merchant are depicted very realistically. Another example is the scholar in "Xiuge," who created a very prominent image of a "soft-boned" intellectual. He suffered robbery by foreigners, and his daughter was defiled, but he still could not rise up to resist. In the end, in order to preserve the family's reputation, he wanted to commit suicide with his daughter to be buried with feudal ethics. The people in the story give such people a pungent satire and a powerful spur.

Of course, the most important thing is that these stories reflect the spiritual outlook of the people, showing the courage, wit, self-confidence, and strength of the people, shaping a series of heroic images, and praising the heroic actions and noble qualities of the people. Liu Laodie in "Red Tassel Broadsword," who single-handedly slaughtered one hundred and eighty foreign devils in one breath, collapsed the Huanglong Bridge with a loud laugh, scaring the foreign devils so that they could not even fire their guns, and before he died, he passed the red tassel broadsword to his son, instructing him to find divine soldiers to continue the fight; Huang Laosan in "Pagoda-Bearing Heavenly King," who was wise, brave, and experienced in struggle, in order to preserve the revolutionary forces, blocked the enemy himself, allowing Li Daliang to escape and contact his brothers to continue the struggle, demonstrating the noble quality of high self-sacrifice. Zong Laolu, a hero who had been tempered for a long time in the Jianghu, Liu Heita, who was honest and filial, Hong Dahai, a giant, and Tie Jingang, who was infinitely powerful and invulnerable to swords and spears...etc., were all extremely ordinary working people. They are heroic images created by the people based on their heroic actions in the struggle, incorporating the people's ideals and wishes. They are concentrated representatives of the people's lives, thoughts, and wishes, have high typical significance, and are rooted in the hearts of the people, praised and admired by the people.

The Boxer Rebellion failed, but the people did not lose their confidence in victory, just as the story says, "People may fail, but the heart does not fail; apparent failure does not mean secret failure." This can be seen from the endings of stories such as "Red Tassel Broadsword," "Pagoda-Bearing Heavenly King," "Hong Dahai," "Liu Heita," and "Zhang Tou and Li Tou." One can sense that a more widespread and powerful revolutionary movement will soon be launched. This is artistic truth and historical truth.

As a popular oral creation, the Boxer Rebellion story is not only a rare artistic treasure with profound ideological content, but also a good unity of content and form. It uses concise language and vivid and rich images to express profound social and political content. Through these images, we can not only understand the history of the people's struggle in the past and gain inspiration and education from it, but also gain artistic enjoyment and satisfaction. It has extremely distinct national characteristics in terms of artistic conception, character creation, expression methods, language, and other aspects.

The Boxer Rebellion stories that have been published all have a beginning and an end, with a tight structure and a very clear background. In terms of expression methods, it is based on realistic content, and creatively inherits the romantic expression methods in folk tales, closely combining reality and fantasy, integrating them into one, and the generalization ability is also very strong. It fully expresses the people's hatred and contempt for the enemy, their firm courage and confidence in victory in the struggle against the enemy, as well as the people's beautiful ideals for the future. For example, the story "Fishing Boy" does not reduce the authenticity of the character image because it has a strong fantasy, nor does it damage the beauty and vividness of the entire story. On the contrary, it enhances the expressiveness and makes the story more touching.

In shaping characters, the authors of the Boxer Rebellion stories also inherited the excellent traditions of folk tales, without lengthy descriptions of appearance and lengthy psychological analysis. It depicts the development and growth of the characters in the actions and struggles of the characters, using the characters' every move and short dialogues, selecting the language that can best express the characters' personality to highlight the characters' personality, so that their voices, smiles, and thoughts are vivid and lively. People hear (or read) it as if they see the person and hear the voice. For example, the old man in "Liu Heita" is written so vividly with just a few strokes, giving a very deep impression. Reading "Zong Laolu" also easily reminds us of the Ruan brothers on Liangshanpo; reading "Hong Dahai" will remind us of Lu Zhishen, who uprooted the weeping willow and punched Zhen Guanxi. This method of shaping characters is a tradition of Chinese people's artistic creation for many years, and it has been well inherited and developed in the Boxer Rebellion stories.

The language of these stories is also concise and vivid, with a strong expressiveness, which can be said to have reached the point of being able to depict sounds, shapes, and colors. It has a relatively strong local flavor and national characteristics, and many are expressive popular oral language. For example, the passage after Hong Dahai beat the "second devil" and sent the robbed girl home is both concise and expressive. I think that the reason why the Boxer Rebellion stories can be attractive and have a strong national style, vivid images, and highly generalized language cannot be said to have played a great role.

The Boxer Rebellion story is a hymn to the heroic behavior shown by the working people in the Boxer Rebellion, and a sentence passed on the imperialists, the ruling class, and the scum of the nation. Its praise of the people and the revolution, and its hatred of the enemy, are profound, specific, powerful, penetrating, and heart-rending. It is a magnificent epic written by the Chinese people with blood and flesh. The collection, sorting, and publication of these stories not only provides the broad masses of people with good literary reading materials, but also has great significance for the literary and art circles on how to inherit traditions, develop traditions, how to learn from the people, how to use the oral language of the people... so as to prosper and develop our literary and art undertakings.

    “义和团运动”的英雄赞歌
    蔚钢
    从去年4月至今年2月在“民间文学”上陆续看到了近三十篇义和团的传说故事。这些传说故事大体可分为两类。一类是盗宝式的幻想性极强的故事，如“小黄牛”“渔童”“白母鸡”等；另一类大部分是直接反映义和团斗争的现实性极强的故事。当然在这类故事里也有着强烈的浪漫主义色彩。
    这些故事是人民反帝反封建斗争的真实的历史。它反映了1900年左右时期的中国人民，在统治阶级的压迫剥削下，已经陷于水深火热、民不聊生的境况，又加上帝国主义入侵，到处抢掠、烧杀、奸淫，人民实在难以再忍受下去了。为了争生存，人民向帝国主义和封建统治阶级展开了血的斗争。义和团运动就如火如荼地在华北各地燃烧起来了。由于帝国主义的入侵，民族矛盾压倒了一切，所以从这些故事中看得出来当时运动的主要矛头是指向帝国主义的。但是在斗争中人民也逐渐认清了所谓官府的真面目——他们是帝国主义的奴才。这些故事深刻而沉痛地描绘了帝国主义和奴才们的凶残，给腐朽、愚蠢的官僚、地主以辛辣的讽刺和无情的揭露。统治阶级屈从于帝国主义，但对人民却是穷凶极恶的，敲诈、勒索，无所不为。真是“贼来如篦，官来如剃”！腐朽的清政府在人民的心目中的确是比贼和匪还更加可恶。通过对帝国主义和统治阶级的揭露，这些故事也形象地表现了义和团运动是“官逼民反”，表现了人民那种威武不能屈的英勇顽强的革命精神，显示了人民的高度的爱国热情。
    这些故事对义和团运动反映得既深且广，几乎各个社会阶层的人物在运动中的思想和行动都有所反映。它相当深刻地表现了帝国主义、统治阶级、地主、恶霸、二毛子的互相勾结。地主、恶霸、二毛子是民族的败类，人类的渣滓。他们有的屈从于帝国主义，有的想利用义和团来保护自己，于是就想法霸团（梁三霸团），霸不成就设法破坏（如“大盐水和二盐水”“砍马二爷”），有的直接与洋毛子通风报信，这些败类当然最后都得到了人民的惩处。地主、恶霸、二毛子又往往是三位一体的，他们上结官府，外通洋人，站在人民头上极尽霸道之能事。义和团运动之所以能够如火如荼地燃遍整个华北，就不难理解了。在这些故事里，不仅深刻地暴露了统治者的凶残面目，而且广泛地揭露了义和团运动里的社会渣滓的丑相，像写“王三发横财”中的投机商人王三，就刻划得相当深刻。当人民与帝国主义、官兵进行生死斗争的时候，他先是奉承洋毛子，但他的洋大人并不赏识，人民打败了洋毛子后，他又利用官兵向人民进行掠夺，义和团来了他又让义和团与官兵打，他自己独吞渔利。对投机商人的言行笑貌及心理活动，描绘得非常逼真。再如“秀阁”中的秀才，塑造了一个非常突出的知识分子“软骨头”的形象，他惨遭洋人抢掠，女儿被蹧蹋，仍然不能起来反抗，而最后为了保全门风，想与女儿一齐自杀，为封建礼教殉葬。对这样的人，人民在故事中给以辛辣的讽刺和有力的鞭策。
    当然，最主要的是，这些故事反映了人民的精神面貌，表现了人民的勇敢、机智、自信和力量，塑造了一系列的英雄形象，赞美了人民的英雄行为和高贵品质。“红缨大刀”里单人匹马地一气宰了百八十个洋毛子之后，大笑一声震坍了皇龙桥，吓得洋毛子连枪也放不响了的刘老爹，临死时还把红缨大刀传给儿子，嘱咐他去找神兵继续战斗；“托塔李天王”中智勇双全、富有斗争经验的黄老三，为了保存革命力量，自己挡住敌人，使李大良脱险再去联络兄弟，继续斗争，表现了高度的自我牺牲的高贵品质。创荡江湖久经锻炼的英雄宗老路，耿直孝顺的刘黑塔，巨人式的洪大海，力大无穷刀枪不入的铁金钢……等，都是极普通的劳动人民，是人民根据自己在斗争中的英雄行为，做出的英雄业迹，溶合着人民的理想和愿望而塑造出来的英雄形象。它们是人民的生活、思想、愿望的集中表现者，有着很高的典型意义，又植根于人民的心中，为人民所传颂、敬仰。
    义和团运动是失败了，但人民并没有丧失胜利的信心，正像故事中所说的“人败心不败，明败暗不败”。这从“红缨大刀”“托塔李天王”“洪大海”“刘黑塔”“张头和李头”等故事的结尾中都可以看得出来。感觉出不久的将来就要有一个更为广泛，力量更为强大的革命运动开展起来。这是艺术的真实，也是历史的真实。
    义和团故事，作为人民口头创作，不仅有很深刻的思想内容，而且是内容与形式得到很好的统一的不可多得的艺术珍品。它用简练的语言、生动丰富的形象，表现了深刻的社会政治内容，透过这些形象我们不但能够理解过去人民斗争的历史，从中得到启发和教益，而且能够得到艺术的享受与满足。它在艺术构思、人物塑造、表现方法、语言等各方面，都有着极为鲜明的民族特色。
    现在所发表的义和团故事都有头有尾，结构紧凑，来龙去脉非常清楚。在表现方法上是以现实内容为依据，又创造性的继承了民间故事中浪漫主义的表现方法，将现实与幻想结合得很紧，使它们溶为一体，概括力也很强。它充分地表现了人民对敌人的憎恨和蔑视的心情，对敌斗争的坚强勇敢和必胜的信心，以及人民对未来的美好的理想，例如“渔童”这篇故事，并不因为它有着很浓的幻想而减低了人物形象的真实，也没有损害了整个故事的优美、生动，相反倒是更增强了表现力，使故事更能感人。
    在塑造人物上，义和团故事的作者们也继承了民间故事的优良传统，没有冗长的形貌的描绘和冗长的心理分析，它是在人物的行动和斗争中描绘人物的发展和成长，运用人物的一举一动和简短的对话，选择最能表现人物性格的语言来突出人物的性格，使它的声音、笑貌和思想都生动活泼起来，人们听了（或读了）如见其人，如闻其声。像“刘黑塔”中的老头，只那么几笔，就写得真龙活现，给人很深刻的印象。读了“宗老路”，也很容易使我们联想起梁山泊上的阮氏兄弟来；读了“洪大海”就会想起倒拔垂杨柳拳打镇关西的鲁智深来。这种塑造人物的方法，是中国人民多少年来艺术创造的传统，而在义和团故事中对它有了很好的继承与发挥。
    这些故事的语言也是简练而生动，有着很强的表现力，可说是达到了绘声绘形绘色的地步。它有着比较浓厚的地方色彩和民族特色，很多都是富有表现力的人民口头语言。如洪大海打了二毛子打发被抢的姑娘回家之后的一段描写，既简练又富有表现力。我想义和团故事之所以能吸引人，能具有浓厚的民族风格，形象生动而又极富概括力的语言，不能不说是起了很大的作用。
    义和团故事是劳动人民在义和团运动中所表现的英雄行为的赞美诗，是对帝国主义、统治阶级以及民族的败类们的判决书。它对人民对革命的歌颂，对敌人的憎恨，都是深刻具体力透纸背、沁人肺腑的。它是中国人民用血和肉写成的雄伟史诗。这些故事的搜集、整理和发表，不但给广大人民提供了良好的文学读物，对文艺界如何继承传统，发展传统，如何向人民学习，如何运用人民的口头语言……从而繁荣和发展我们的文艺事业，也都有着很大的意义。
