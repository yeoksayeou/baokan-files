Grasp the Central Link in Improving Steel Quality
Resolutely Reduce the Sulfur Content of Pig Iron from Small Blast Furnaces
Yangquan and Anyang Iron and Steel Plants Strengthen Raw Material Management and Adopt Technical Measures

According to Shanxi Daily, the workers of Yangquan Iron and Steel Plant have taken a series of measures to overcome the sulfur content problem in pig iron, greatly improving product quality and gradually increasing the qualified rate of pig iron. The average qualified rate of pig iron from May 1st to 9th was 14.89%, the average qualified rate from May 10th to 14th increased to 34.65%, the average qualified rate on May 13th was 63%, and the average qualified rate on May 14th was 92.5%; the sulfur content of iron was reduced from 0.15 to about 0.04, reaching the standard of No. 2 and No. 3 foundry iron and No. 2 and No. 3 steelmaking iron.

The quality of pig iron at Yangquan Iron and Steel Plant had dropped significantly in the previous period, which not only affected the completion of the total output value according to the national plan, but also affected the steelmaking of brother factories, and even casting in their own factory could not be used. In order to reverse this situation, with the help of the Provincial and Prefectural Party Committee working groups, they conducted a comprehensive analysis, research, and summary inspection of product quality problems in early May. Then, among all employees, through detailed accounting, reasoning, and finding the reasons, they criticized the erroneous understanding of emphasizing quantity over quality and the idea that the quality of raw materials was not good enough to guarantee the quality of pig iron. At the same time, a three-way combination technical research meeting involving leading cadres, technicians, and veteran workers was held, and all employees were widely mobilized to come up with ways to improve quality. Finally, it was decided to take the following technical measures to improve the quality of pig iron: First, strengthen raw material management, reduce the sulfur and ash content of coke, store various types of coke separately, and screen them before feeding them into the furnace. Second, improve operation, strengthen desulfurization in the furnace, and appropriately increase the slag ratio and silicon content of pig iron. Third, strengthen external desulfurization, concentrate on the use of soda ash, and experiment with using quicklime powder for desulfurization.

Starting from the 10th, they first conducted typical experiments on No. 3 blast furnace under the personal leadership of the plant director, Wang Zhong. By adjusting the coke load, increasing the wind temperature, and increasing the slag ratio, the desulfurization capacity was greatly strengthened. The sulfur content of pig iron in this furnace was reduced from 0.15 to 0.35 to below 0.05, and the qualified rate of pig iron reached more than 90%. Subsequently, other blast furnaces also took measures to improve product quality. On the 14th, the average qualified rate of pig iron in the whole plant reached 92.5%, among which the qualified rates of No. 3, No. 4, No. 6, and No. 7 blast furnaces reached more than 95%.

According to Henan Daily, Anyang Iron and Steel Company's Shuiye Iron Smelting Plant in Henan Province, due to strengthened raw material management and high-temperature smelting by raising wind temperature, all five 28-cubic-meter blast furnaces in the plant have achieved high quality and high production in the movement to produce high-quality pig iron.

In order to ensure the completion of the annual pig iron task, the iron smelting workshop of this plant assigned various economic indicators on a daily, furnace, and shift basis, and quickly launched a red flag competition movement throughout the workshop between furnaces, shifts, and groups for "two highs" (high quality and high output), "two lows" (low coke ratio and low cost), and "one less" (less labor). Their slogan is "Fight the Red May, Break Through the Pig Iron Quality Barrier!" The enthusiasm of all the workers in the workshop is getting higher and higher, and more and more specific measures are being found. Moreover, other subsidiary workshops are also closely cooperating and vigorously supporting in the spirit of collaboration. According to statistics from May 1st to 10th alone, the average daily output of five 28-cubic-meter blast furnaces was 140.4835 tons, an increase of 23.4% compared with the average daily output in April; the utilization coefficient averaged above 1, an increase of 15.1% compared with April; the average coke ratio decreased to 1:1.25, a decrease of 6.7% compared with April; the sulfur content decreased from 0.185 in April to below 0.06; the qualified rate of pig iron reached 98%; the cost per ton of iron decreased by 10% compared with the monthly average in the first quarter. The output and quality of pig iron all met the national requirements.

The reasons why this plant has been able to gradually improve quality and output are that, in addition to putting politics in command, grasping the advanced, grasping the key to production, and organizing forces to carry out surprise attacks, it has taken measures to strengthen raw material management, change the charging ratio, ensure that ore with an iron content of less than 40% is not put into the furnace; ensure high-temperature operation, first actively making U-shaped pipes, changing the number of tuyeres from four to eight to carry out multi-nozzle combustion; master the furnace top material distribution, and continue to use lime as a flux. Therefore, in the past ten days, some blast furnaces in the plant have achieved continuous high quality and high output, the utilization coefficient has been improved, the coke ratio has been reduced, and the sulfur content of pig iron has quickly been reduced from 0.15 to below 0.06.

    抓住当前提高钢铁质量的中心环节
    坚决降低小高炉生铁含硫量
    阳泉、安阳钢铁厂加强原料管理采取技术措施
    据山西日报消息　阳泉钢铁厂的职工，采取了一系列措施，猛攻生铁含硫关，大大提高了产品质量，生铁合格率逐渐上升。5月1日至9日的生铁平均合格率是14.89％，10日至14日的平均合格率提高到了34.65％，13日的平均合格率是63％，14日的平均合格率是92.5％；铁的含硫量由过去的零点一五降低到了零点零四左右，达到了二、三号铸造铁和二、三号炼钢铁的标准。
    阳泉钢铁厂前一段的生铁质量大大下降，不仅影响了按照国家计划完成生产总值，而且影响了兄弟厂的炼钢，就是本厂搞铸造也不能使用。为了扭转这个情况，他们在省委、地委工作组的帮助下，在5月初就产品质量问题进行了全面的分析研究和总结检查。接着在全体职工中，通过算细账、讲道理、找原因，批判了重量轻质和认为原料质量不好便不能保证生铁质量的错误认识。同时召开了有领导干部、技术人员、老工人参加的三结合技术研究会，并广泛发动全体职工想办法提高质量。最后决定采取以下技术措施来提高生铁质量：第一，加强原料管理，降低焦比的硫分和灰分，各种焦炭分堆存放，经过筛拣，分别入炉。第二，改进操作，加强炉内脱硫，适当提高渣比和生铁含矽量。第三，加强炉外脱硫，集中使用苏打，并且试验用生石灰粉脱硫。
    从10日开始，他们先由厂长王忠亲自领导，在三号高炉上进行典型试验。经过调整焦炭负荷，提高风温，提高渣比，大大加强了脱硫能力，这个炉的生铁含硫量由零点一五至零点三五降低到零点零五以下，生铁合格率达到了90％以上。接着其它高炉也均分别采取措施提高产品质量。14日，全厂生铁平均合格率达到了92.5％，其中三号、四号、六号、七号高炉的合格率达到了95％以上。
    据河南日报消息　河南省安阳钢铁公司水冶炼铁厂，在生铁优质高产运动中，由于加强了原料管理，提高风温进行高温冶炼，全厂五座二十八立方公尺的高炉，都达到了优质高产。
    这个厂的炼铁车间为保证全年生铁任务的完成，按日按炉按班分配了各种经济指标，并迅速在全车间掀起了炉与炉、班与班、组与组之间两高（高质高产）、两低（焦比低、成本低）、一少（使用劳力少）的红旗竞赛运动。他们的口号是
  “大战红五月，突破生铁质量关”。全车间职工干劲越来越大，措施越找越多越具体，而且其他附属车间也都本着协作精神，密切配合大力支援。仅据5月1日到10日的统计，五座二十八立方公尺高炉平均日产一百四十点四八三五吨，比4月份平均日产提高23.4％；利用系数平均达到一以上，比4月份提高15.1％；焦比平均下降为一比一点二五，比4月份下降6.7％；含硫量由4月份的零点一八五，下降为零点零六以下；生铁合格率达到98％；每吨铁的成本比第一季度月平均下降10％。生铁的产量和质量，全部达到国家要求标准。
    这个厂所以能获得质量产量逐步提高的原因，除了政治挂帅，抓先进，抓生产关键和组织力量进行突击外，采取了加强原料管理，改变上料比例，保证含铁量在40％以下的矿石不入炉；保证高温操作，首先积极制作了U型管子，把风嘴由四个改成八个，进行多嘴燃烧；掌握好炉顶布料，继续使用石灰作熔剂。因此近十天来，全厂的一些高炉，就都连续优质高产，利用系数提高，焦比降低，生铁含硫量很快由零点一五降低到零点零六以下。（附图片）
