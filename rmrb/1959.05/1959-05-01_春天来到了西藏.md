    Spring Comes to Tibet
    Gesang Lamu
    I am a young Tibetan dancer. In the past few years, I have been to Xinjiang, Guangxi, Hainan, Inner Mongolia, Ningxia... and other places, and I have seen that under the care of the Party and Chairman Mao, the people of all ethnic groups have realized regional autonomy and embarked on a broad road to happiness. In particular, with last year’s Great Leap Forward, the people of all ethnic minorities, together with our Han elder brothers, entered an era where one day equals twenty years. The people of all ethnic groups in Guangxi demonstrated the heroic spirit of "commanding mountains to move and summoning water to come" in building reservoirs; the Hui and Han people of Ningxia fought day and night to make steel; Baotou Steel in Inner Mongolia stands like a giant on the grassland; and the Kawa people of the Greater Liang Mountains have leaped from slavery to socialism at a rate of one day equaling a thousand years. Every time I see these miraculous facts, I am very excited and deeply feel the boundless warmth of the motherland's big family. But when all ethnic groups in the motherland are entering socialism, the people of Tibet are still living in poverty under the old system. How much I look forward to Tibet being reformed quickly, so that the Tibetan people can live a good life.
    In 1956, I went to Tibet with the central delegation and saw the painful lives of some Tibetan compatriots: they built houses with the bones of cattle and horses, and their clothes were so ragged that they could not be repaired. The central delegation distributed "alms" to the Tibetan people, who were so moved that they couldn't sleep all night and said that Chairman Mao was a god. In this year, the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region was established. I thought that the lives of the Tibetan people would get better, but the Tibetan local government and the upper-class reactionary group consistently opposed reform, preventing the people from obtaining freedom and happiness, and maintaining their oppression and rule. This armed rebellion is a complete exposure of their sinful attempt.
    Now, Tibet is reborn, and spring has come to the banks of the Lhasa River and the Yarlung Zangbo River, bringing happiness to the Tibetan people. The Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region has truly exercised its functions and powers. From now on, the Tibetan people will advance together with the people of all ethnic groups in the motherland on the road of socialism. Now, a beautiful picture appears before my eyes: the Tibetan people have embarked on a new historical period, and under the warm sunshine of the Party and Chairman Mao, they are leaping forward at a thousand miles a day to build a paradise on earth in Tibet.

    春天来到了西藏
    格桑拉姆
    我是一个藏族的年青舞蹈演员。几年来，我去过了新疆、广西、海南、内蒙古、宁夏……等地，看到了各民族人民在党和毛主席的关怀下，实现了区域自治，走上了宽阔的幸福大道，特别是去年的大跃进，各少数民族人民和汉族老大哥一起，进入了一天等于二十年的时代。广西的各民族人民在兴修水库中，表现了“命山山走，叫水水来”的雄伟气概；宁夏的回汉人民日夜奋战，大闹钢铁；内蒙古的包钢像巨人般的屹立在草原上；还有大梁山的卡瓦族更是一天等于千年的从奴隶社会飞跃到社会主义社会。每当我看到这些奇迹一般的事实，我总是非常激动，深深感到祖国大家庭的无限温暖。但是当祖国各民族都进入到社会主义的时候，西藏的人民却仍然在旧的制度下过着贫困的生活。我多么盼望着西藏能赶快改革，让西藏人民能过美好的生活。
    1956年，我随中央代表团去西藏，看到一些藏胞的痛苦的生活：他们用牛马的骨头盖房子，衣服破烂得都无法补了。中央代表团给藏族人民发放了“布施”，藏胞们感动得一夜都睡不着觉，并说毛主席是神。就在这年，西藏自治区筹委会成立了。我满以为西藏人民的生活会好起来，但是西藏地方政府和上层反动集团一贯反对改革，不让人民获得自由和幸福，保持他们的压迫和统治。这次的武装叛乱正是他们这种罪恶企图的彻底暴露。
    现在，西藏新生了，春天来到了拉萨河和雅鲁藏布江的两岸，她把幸福带给了藏族人民。西藏自治区筹委会已真正行使了它的职权。从此西藏人民将和祖国各族人民一起在社会主义的大道上前进。现在，在我的眼前，出现了一幅美好的图景，西藏人民从此走上了新的历史时期，他们在党和毛主席温暖阳光的照耀下，一日千里的向前飞跃，建设西藏的人间乐园。
