Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, 16th. The Dongfeng brand automatic grain combine harvester, designed by China itself, has recently been successfully trial-produced at the Shenyang Farm Implement Manufacturing Factory.

　　This automatic grain combine harvester was designed based on the situation of agricultural production increase and the growth characteristics of crops in China, with reference to relevant information on foreign products. This harvester not only automates the entire operation process of harvesting, threshing, grain cleaning, transportation, and bagging, but also, due to its wider cutter width and the installation of double drums, can operate in high-yield fields with a yield of 3,000 catties per mu.

    我国设计的自动谷物联合收割机试制成功
    新华社沈阳16日电　我国自己设计的东风牌自动谷物联合收割机，最近在沈阳农具制造厂试制成功。
    这台自动谷物联合收割机，是根据我国农业增产情况和农作物生长特点，参照国外产品的有关资料设计的。这台收割机，不仅收割、脱谷、清粮、运输、装袋等全部操作过程都是自动化的，而且由于它的剪刀幅度较宽，装置了双滚筒，可以在亩产三千斤的高产田里作业。
