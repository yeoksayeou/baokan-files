Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 21st May: State-owned trading companies in Tibet are vigorously supplying the Tibetan people with daily necessities such as tea and salt. The Tibet General Company of State-Owned Trading Companies is also transferring a large quantity of commodities specially needed by the Tibetan people from the mainland to meet the needs of the Tibetan compatriots.

From July-August of last year to February-March of this year, the rebellious bandits in Tibet looted, burned, and killed throughout Tibet, destroyed roads, and ambushed vehicles, disrupting urban-rural exchanges and commercial trade networks. This prevented the transportation and sale of large quantities of tea stored in Lhasa, and the salt from Heihe could not be transported to the Shannan and Bomi areas, which urgently needed it. During this period, black markets appeared in various parts of Tibet, and tea prices soared three to four times, and it was still difficult to buy. Many families had to boil tree leaves or grass roots into bitter water to drink as tea.

After the Lhasa rebellion was quelled, the Finance and Economics Committee of the CCP Tibet Working Committee and the Tibet General Company of State-Owned Trading Companies immediately made arrangements to supply the Tibetan people with urgently needed daily necessities such as tea and salt. Now, hundreds of thousands of catties of tea and salt have been transported to various places. In the Lhasa Nationalities Store, groups of citizens and suburban farmers come every day to buy tea, salt, cloth, and general merchandise. The Shannan Zedang Trading Branch, immediately after the rebellion was quelled on April 15, immediately took out tea transported from Lhasa and transferred part of the edible salt from government offices and troops to meet the urgent needs of the local Tibetan compatriots. By the beginning of May, it had sold more than 12,000 bricks and tuo teas. In order to take care of the Tibetan compatriots from far away, the salespersons warmly received customers even outside of business hours. Trade departments in Xigaze, Qamdo, Heihe, Gyangze, Yadong, and other places are also sending trade teams as much as possible, carrying daily necessities such as tea and salt deep into rural areas and pastures. The work team sent by the Heihe Military Control Commission also directly exchanged tea and other commodities for the herders' unsold livestock products. The trading branch there will purchase 1.5 million to 2 million catties of lake salt this year for the people of Shannan and Bomi.

The military control commissions in various parts of Tibet have accepted the entrustment of the state-owned trading companies, and the work teams uniformly act as sales agents for tea when they go to the countryside. In this way, Tibetan compatriots in many places can buy tea and salt at their doorsteps, which is warmly welcomed by the Tibetan compatriots. The work teams in Mozhugongka, Quxu, Duilongdeqing, Dangxiong, and other five zongs (districts) in the Lhasa area have recently brought more than 18,500 bricks and tuo teas to the countryside. When the staff of the Lhasa Municipal Military Control Commission sent a batch of tea to the Xika (manor) in Mozhugongka Zong, Tibetan men and women surrounded them with laughter. They said with emotion: "It's really great that the tea is delivered to our doorstep, and the price is so cheap. When the rebellious bandits were there, a piece of tea cost more than four yuan, but now it only costs more than one yuan. The Communist Party and the People's Liberation Army are the great saviors of us poor people, and the rebellious bandits are harmful demons."

### 西藏国营贸易公司迅速安排运销工作  大量供应藏胞茶盐百货

    西藏国营贸易公司迅速安排运销工作
    大量供应藏胞茶盐百货
    新华社拉萨21日电　西藏各地的国营贸易公司正在大力供应西藏人民茶叶、盐等生活必需品。国营贸易公司西藏总公司还正在从内地调运大量藏族人民特需的商品，供应藏胞的需要。
    从去年七八月到今年二三月，叛匪在西藏各地抢劫烧杀、挖毁公路、伏击汽车，破坏了城乡交流和商业贸易网，使存放拉萨的大批茶叶运销不出去，黑河的盐巴也不能运往急需食盐的山南和波密地区。在这期间，西藏各地出现了黑市，茶叶价格猛涨三、四倍，而且还很难买到，许多人家不得不用树叶或草根熬成苦水当茶喝。
    拉萨叛乱平息后，中共西藏工委财经委员会和国营贸易公司西藏总公司立即对供应西藏人民迫切需要的茶叶、盐巴等生活必需品作了安排。现在，几十万斤茶叶和盐巴已经运往各地。拉萨民族商店里每天都有成群的市民和郊区农民来购买茶叶、盐巴、布匹和日用百货。山南泽当贸易分公司在4月15日叛乱刚一平息之后，马上就拿出从拉萨赶运来的茶叶并从机关、部队抽调了部分食盐供应当地藏胞的迫切需要，到五月初已卖出砖茶、沱茶一万二千多块。为了照顾远地来的藏胞，售货员在非营业时间也热情地接待顾客。日喀则、昌都、黑河、江孜、亚东等地的贸易部门还在尽可能地派出贸易小组，携带茶叶、盐巴等生活必需品深入农村和牧场。黑河军管会派出的工作队还直接用茶叶等价交换牧民们滞销的畜产品。那里的贸易分公司今年将收购一百五十至二百万斤湖盐，供给山南和波密人民食用。
    西藏各地军管会都接受了国营贸易公司的委托，工作队下乡时一律代销茶叶。这样，很多地方的藏胞都能在自己的家门口买到茶叶和盐巴，受到藏胞们的热烈欢迎。拉萨地区墨竹工卡、曲水、堆龙德庆、当雄等五个宗的工作队，最近已把一万八千五百多块砖茶和沱茶带到乡下。拉萨市军管会派往墨竹工卡宗的工作人员把一批茶叶带到了溪卡（庄园）时，男女藏胞都欢笑着围上来，他们感动地说：“真是太好了，茶叶送到家门口，价钱又是这样便宜，叛匪在的时候，一块茶叶要四块多钱，现在只卖一块多钱。共产党、人民解放军是我们穷苦人的大救星，叛匪是害人的魔鬼。”
