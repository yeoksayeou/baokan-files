    Welcome "June 1st" with Well-Brought-Up Children
    Capital Childcare Workers Hold Broadcast Rally

    (Our Newspaper) News – At a broadcast rally held on the evening of the 11th, childcare workers in the capital expressed their determination to greet the "June 1st" International Children's Day with practical actions of actively participating in the "Loving Children, Raising Children Well" campaign.

    Since the launch of the "Loving Children, Raising Children Well" red banner competition during the "March 8th" Festival, the childcare work in Beijing has seen even more new atmospheres. They have put forward the idea of "loving other people's children as if loving their own." With their active efforts, the health and education quality of childcare organizations throughout the city have been further improved. The weight of all fifteen children aged six to fifteen months in the small class of Xila Hutong Nursery has increased, and eight of them have gained more than one and a half jin in weight within a month. The twenty-two childcare organizations under the jurisdiction of the Tiyuguan Road Office in Chongwen District have basically eliminated the common acute conjunctivitis among children in the past since the launch of the competition. Children in the large class of the Zhongzhi Xiyuan Organ Kindergarten used to have phenomena such as cursing, lying, and running around. After the patient education of the childcare staff, this class has now been transformed into a good class with mutual assistance, friendship, politeness, and discipline. In the competition, many childcare staff members have tried their best to do "good deeds" for the children. They have done many things that mothers used to do. When the educators of the Municipal No. 1 Kindergarten mended clothes for the children, they sewed a plum blossom on the clothes when there was a round hole, and sewed a "centipede" when there was a triangular hole, so that the children looked beautiful even when wearing mended clothes.

    At the city-wide childcare workers' broadcast rally jointly held by the Beijing Women's Federation and the Municipal Education Bureau and the Public Health Bureau on the evening of the 11th, the childcare staff of seven childcare organizations, including the Municipal Xila Hutong Nursery, the No. 1 Kindergarten, and the Xitiejang Street Kindergarten in Xicheng District, reported to the city's childcare workers on their achievements since the launch of the competition, and proposed the action slogan of welcoming "June 1st" by bringing up children well. Wu Han, Deputy Mayor of Beijing, and Zhang Xiaomei, Director of the Beijing Women's Federation, encouraged childcare workers at the meeting to strengthen their professional study and ideological training, to learn from each other, help each other, and pay attention to summarizing and promoting advanced experience in further developing the red banner competition.

    带好孩子迎接“六一”
    首都保育工作者举行广播大会
    本报讯　首都保育工作者，在11日晚举行的广播大会上，表示要以积极参加“热爱孩子、带好孩子”的实际行动，迎接“六一”国际儿童节。
    自从“三八”节开展“热爱孩子、带好孩子”的红旗竞赛以来，北京市的保育工作出现了更多的新气象。她们提出了“要像爱自己孩子一样来爱别人的孩子。”在她们的积极努力下，全市托儿组织的保健、教育质量都有进一步提高。锡拉胡同托儿所小班十五名六至十五个月的孩子的体重都增加了，其中有八个孩子在一个月内体重增加一斤半以上。崇文区体育馆路办事处管界的二十二处托儿组织，在开展竞赛以后，现在已经基本上消灭了过去儿童常见的急性结膜炎。中直西苑机关幼儿园大班孩子过去常有骂人、说谎、到处乱跑等现象，经过保教人员的耐心教育，现在这个班已转变为互助友爱、有礼貌、守纪律的好班。在竞赛中，许多保教人员都千方百计地为孩子们办“好事”，她们做了许多过去妈妈们做的工作。市立第一幼儿园教养员在给孩子缝补衣服时，衣服上破一个圆洞就缝上一朵梅花，破一个三角洞就缝一个“蜈蚣”，使孩子们穿了补的服装也很美观。
    在北京市妇女联合会和市教育局、公共卫生局11日晚联合举行的全市保育工作者广播大会上，市立锡拉胡同托儿所、第一幼儿园、西城区西铁匠街道幼儿园等七个托儿组织的保教人员向全市保育工作者汇报了她们开展竞赛以来的成绩，并提出了以带好孩子迎接“六一”的行动口号。北京市副市长吴晗和北京市妇女联合会主任张晓梅在会上勉励保育人员加强业务学习和思想锻炼，在进一步开展红旗竞赛中，要互相学习、互相帮助，同时注意总结推广先进经验。（沈骊珠）
