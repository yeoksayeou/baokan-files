Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 22nd: Soviet Premier Khrushchev said on the 20th, when receiving a delegation from the World Federation of Scientific Workers, that we would be very pleased if an agreement on ending nuclear weapons tests could be reached in Geneva before the end of this year. Members of the World Federation of Scientific Workers delegation quoted these words of Khrushchev at a press conference held in Moscow.

At the press conference, a letter from the delegation to Khrushchev was read out. Members of the delegation also spoke about Khrushchev's answers to the questions they raised during the meeting with him.

According to Professor Auger (France), Khrushchev emphasized that he saw nothing preventing a rapid conclusion of an agreement to halt nuclear weapons tests. Khrushchev said that the number of monitoring posts and the issue of membership were not major difficulties, and there was no need for extensive investigation. Khrushchev said that after establishing supervision of the implementation of the agreement, the method of selective investigation, widely adopted by various scientific departments, could be successfully employed, and this method could lead to correct conclusions about the nature of the entire phenomenon.

Delegation members also said at the press conference that Khrushchev told them that the Soviet Union does not support the proposal to conduct test explosions at altitudes above fifty kilometers. He said that he did not know what kind of methods had proven that such high-altitude explosions were safe and that radioactive dust would not fall to the ground.

The scientists said that Khrushchev regretted that some people in the West did not want to explain to the general public the significant dangers posed by nuclear weapons tests. These people always try to underestimate this danger without giving sufficient reasons. Khrushchev emphasized that scientists in various countries can play a major role in explaining this danger and exposing the absurd statements of those who oppose stopping nuclear tests.

During the meeting with the scientists, Khrushchev also discussed the issue of easing international tensions, including resolving the broader issue of disarmament and conducting international cooperation in using scientific achievements for peaceful purposes.

In the letter that the delegation gave to Khrushchev, which was read out at the press conference, the scientists expressed their concern about the serious threat posed by the arms race and continued nuclear weapons tests. However, they believe that the obstacles preventing an agreement in Geneva can be quickly eliminated, and the proposal for both sides to conduct a limited number of investigations each year provides the possibility for reaching a final agreement.

    赫鲁晓夫向世界科协代表团说
    苏联希望年内达成协议停止核试验
    新华社23日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科22日讯：苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫20日在接见世界科学工作者协会代表团时说，如果今年年底以前能在日内瓦达成停止核武器试验的协议，我们将很高兴。世界科学工作者协会代表团的成员在莫斯科举行的记者招待会上曾引用了赫鲁晓夫说的这些话。
    在记者招待会上宣读了代表团给赫鲁晓夫的信。代表团团员还谈到了赫鲁晓夫在同他们会见时对他们提出的问题的答复。
    据毕加教授（法国）说，赫鲁晓夫曾强调指出，他看不到有什么东西阻碍着迅速缔结停止核武器试验的协议。赫鲁晓夫说，监督岗的数目和成员问题并不是很大的困难，没有必要进行大量的调查。赫鲁晓夫说，建立对协议执行情况的监督后，可以成功地采用各种科学部门广泛采用的选择调查的方法，用这种方法可以得出有关整个现象的性质的正确结论。
    代表团团员们在记者招待会上还谈到，赫鲁晓夫曾对他们说，苏联不支持在五十公里以上的高空进行试验爆炸的建议。他说，他不知道，什么样的方法已证明这种高空爆炸是安全的和放射性尘埃不会落到地面上来。
    科学家们说，赫鲁晓夫曾遗憾地指出，西方某些人士不希望向广大公众解释核武器试验带来的重大危险。这些人士总是设法低估这种危险，而不说明充分的理由。赫鲁晓夫着重指出，各国科学家在说明这种危险和揭露反对停止核试验的人的荒谬言论方面能够起很大作用。
    赫鲁晓夫在同科学家们会见时还讨论了缓和国际紧张局势的问题，其中包括解决更广泛的裁军问题以及在利用科学成就为和平目的服务方面进行国际合作的问题。
    在代表团交给赫鲁晓夫的、并在记者招待会上宣读的信中，科学家们对由于军备竞赛和继续核武器试验所产生的严重威胁表示不安。但是他们相信，妨碍在日内瓦达成协议的障碍能够很快地消除，关于双方每年进行有限数量的调查的建议为通过最后的协议提供了可能性。（附图片）
