Xinhua News Agency, 10th Dispatch: The national irrigation and drainage power machinery production plan for April was completed successfully, with a total of more than 660,000 horsepower of machinery produced, accounting for 66% of the second quarter production plan. The quality of the machinery has also improved.

After the national machinery industry system held a radio rally in mid-April to mobilize the completion of the six major equipment tasks, workers producing irrigation and drainage machinery and other machinery were full of energy and universally launched red flag competitions. The production of irrigation and drainage machinery in mid-April increased by 70% compared with the first ten days of the month, and the output in the last ten days of the month increased by 20% compared with mid-April.

The Tianjin Tractor Factory and Tianjin Internal Combustion Engine Factory, which proposed friendly competition to all irrigation and drainage power machinery factories in the country at the radio rally, have both completed their main competition conditions. The Tianjin Tractor Factory proposed to produce 54,000 horsepower of irrigation and drainage power machinery in the second quarter. The factory launched a red flag competition movement comparing quality, output, savings, technological revolution, labor productivity, and safety. In April alone, it produced 21,200 horsepower of irrigation and drainage machinery, accounting for 38.3% of the second quarter plan. The Tianjin Internal Combustion Engine Factory's target was to guarantee the completion of 6,750 horsepower in April, and it actually completed 9,100 horsepower, exceeding the target by 2,350 horsepower. The Wuxi Diesel Engine Factory completed its task ahead of schedule by two days, setting a new monthly output record for the factory. After improving production management, workers at the Shandong Weifang Diesel Engine Factory increased production from eight diesel engine blocks per day to fourteen. Workers at the Nanjing Automobile Factory made great efforts in technological innovation and actively saved materials, enabling the entire factory to complete the manufacturing task of irrigation and drainage power machinery for April seven days ahead of schedule. The Shanghai Chengfu Iron Factory adopted the method of finding key issues at each level, solving key issues at each level, and solving key issues on time. After hard work, ingenuity, and practical work by the workers, it completed the task of manufacturing diesel engines for irrigation and drainage three days ahead of schedule. Workers at the Shenyang Chengyuan Iron Factory made great efforts in technological innovation, overcame difficulties such as shortages of materials, equipment, and manpower, and completed the manufacturing task of 330 20-horsepower diesel engines six days ahead of schedule, exceeding the target by seven units.

Many enterprises have strengthened production management and established inspection systems in the competition movement, so the quality of products has also been greatly improved. The First Automobile Manufacturing Plant, in conjunction with carrying out communist ideological education, criticized the idea of neglecting quality, established a three-inspection system of self-inspection, mutual inspection, and inspector inspection, as well as a waste product inspection meeting and a line-drawing inspection system for models and blanks, which reduced the scrap rate of castings for irrigation and drainage machinery produced in April by more than 50% compared with the past. Workers at the Yangliuqing Power Machine Factory proposed to guarantee the qualification of each unit in the production of irrigation and drainage machinery, strictly carried out technical inspections, greatly reduced the scrap rate and production costs. The cost of a gas engine was 1,356 yuan in the past, but now the cost of a gas engine has been reduced to 800 yuan. The Party Committee of the Shanghai Diesel Engine Factory tightly grasped the link of improving quality, mobilized the workers to speak out freely, formulated process regulations, and vigorously carried out technological innovations centered on improving quality, thereby reducing the scrap rate of castings to 3.9%, of which the scrap rate of machine blocks was reduced to 1.5%.

    排灌机械源源出厂
    四月份生产66万多马力动力机械占二季度计划的66％
    新华社10日讯　全国4月份排灌动力机械生产计划完成得好，共生产了六十六万多匹马力的机械，占第二季度生产计划的66％。机械的质量也有所提高。
    4月中旬全国机械工业系统举行了动员完成六大设备的广播大会以后，生产排灌机械和其它机械的职工们，干劲十足，普遍地开展了红旗竞赛。4月中旬生产的排灌机械比上旬增加了70％，下旬的产量又比中旬增加了20％。
    在广播大会上向全国各生产排灌动力机械厂提出友谊竞赛的天津拖拉机厂和天津内燃机厂，都完成了他们的主要竞赛条件。天津拖拉机厂提出在二季度内要生产五万四千马力的排灌动力机械。这个厂开展了比质量、比产量、比节约、比技术革命、比劳动生产率、比安全的红旗竞赛运动，4月份一个月内就生产了二万一千二百马力的排灌机械，占二季度计划的38.3％。天津内燃机厂的指标是保证在4月份完成六千七百五十马力，4月份实际完成了九千一百马力，超额二千三百五十马力。无锡柴油机厂提前两天超额完成了任务，创造了本厂历年来月产量最高纪录。山东潍坊柴油机厂职工改进生产管理后，由过去日产八个柴油机机座提高到日产十四个。南京汽车厂职工大闹技术革命，积极地节约材料，使全厂提前七天超额完成了4月份排灌动力机械的制造任务。上海诚孚铁工厂采取了层层找关键、层层破关键、定时破关键的办法，经过职工苦干、巧干与实干，提前三天完成了4月份制造排灌用的柴油机的任务。沈阳成源铁工厂职工大闹技术革命，克服了材料、设备、人力不足的困难，提前六天超额七台完成三百三十台二十马力柴油机制造任务。
    许多企业都在竞赛运动中加强了生产管理，建立了检验制度，因此产品质量也有了很大提高。第一汽车制造厂结合开展共产主义思想教育，批判了忽视质量的思想，建立了自己检验、互相检验、检查员检验的三检制度，以及废品检查会和模型、毛坯等划线检查制度，使4月份生产排灌机械铸件的废品率比过去降低了50％多。杨柳青动力机厂职工在生产排灌机械中提出保证台台合格，严格进行了技术检验，大大降低了废品率和生产成本，过去一台煤气机成本是一千三百五十六元，现在一台煤气机降至八百元。上海柴油机厂党委紧紧抓住提高质量这一环，发动职工大鸣大放，制定工艺规程，大力开展了以提高质量为中心的技术革命，从而把铸件废品率降低到3.9％，其中机座废品率降到1.5％。（附图片）
