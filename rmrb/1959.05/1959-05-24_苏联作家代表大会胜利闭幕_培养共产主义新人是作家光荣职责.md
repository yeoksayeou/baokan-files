Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 23rd: The Third Soviet Writers' Congress successfully concluded this afternoon. Soviet Communist Party leaders Furtseva and Pospelov attended the closing ceremony.

The Soviet writer Simonov read out a letter of salute from the Congress to the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party at the meeting. The letter stated that Soviet writers must use all their strength to fulfill the glorious tasks given to them by the Party. Cultivating new communist people will become the most glorious duty of Soviet writers. Soviet writers will further strive for the Party spirit of literature, for the close connection between literature and the people, and for the prosperity of the multinational socialist realist literature.

The meeting also passed a resolution on Surkov's report ("The Tasks of Soviet Literature in Communist Construction").

The resolution stated that in the new historical conditions of the comprehensive construction of a communist society, the educational role and the role of transforming society of Soviet literature are becoming increasingly important. The mission of Soviet literature, armed with the time-tested method of socialist realism, is to actively promote the formation of the spirit of the new communist society, to establish the principles of communist ethics and morality, and to help the country realize its grand construction program.

The resolution pointed out that modern life is the soul of Soviet literature. To reflect the beautiful Soviet reality profoundly and vividly is the writer's lofty duty to the people. Writers must use sharp and pungent artistic language to actively struggle against all obstacles hindering the progress of the Soviet people, boldly expose the contradictions of real life, and help new and advanced things to achieve victory.

The resolution emphasized that the most important task of Soviet writers was, and still is, to resolutely fight against imperialist ideology and various manifestations of revisionism, to oppose all forms of human oppression, to oppose bourgeois nationalism, and to strive for peace and the victory of the internationalist unity of the working people. Writers must further improve their artistic skills and improve the work of cultivating talented young people—the new literary successors.

The Congress adopted the new charter of the Soviet Writers' Union and announced that 143 people were elected as members of the Central Council of the Writers' Union; 29 people were elected as members of the Supervisory Committee.

    苏联作家代表大会胜利闭幕
    培养共产主义新人是作家光荣职责
    新华社莫斯科23日电　苏联第三次作家代表大会23日下午胜利闭幕。苏联共产党领导人福尔采娃和波斯别洛夫出席了闭幕式。
    苏联作家西蒙诺夫在会上宣读了代表大会给苏联共产党中央委员会的致敬信。信中说，苏联作家一定要用全部力量来完成党给予的光荣任务。培养共产主义新人，将成为苏联作家最光荣的职责。苏联作家将进一步为文学的党性，为文学与人民紧密联系和繁荣多民族的社会主义现实主义文学而斗争。
    会议还就苏尔科夫的报告（“苏联文学在共产主义建设中的任务”）通过了一项决议。
    决议说，在全面展开共产主义社会建设的新的历史条件下，苏联文学的教育作用和改造社会的作用越来越大了。用久经考验的社会主义现实主义方法武装的苏联文学的使命，是积极促进新的共产主义社会的人的精神的形成，确定共产主义伦理和道德的原则，帮助国家实现宏伟的建设纲领。
    决议指出，现代生活是苏联文学的灵魂。深刻而鲜明地反映苏联美好现实是作家对人民应尽的崇高的天职。作家必须用尖刻而辛辣的艺术语言，同那些阻挠苏联人民前进的一切障碍进行积极的斗争，大胆地暴露现实生活的矛盾，帮助新的、先进的事物获得胜利。
    决议强调指出，苏联文学家的最重要的任务过去是，现在仍然是同帝国主义意识形态，同修正主义的各种表现进行坚决斗争，反对各种形式的人压迫人的现象，反对资产阶级民族主义，争取和平和劳动人民的国际主义团结的胜利。作家必须进一步提高艺术技巧，改进培养有天才的青年——新的文学接班人的工作。
    大会通过了苏联作家协会的新会章，宣布一百四十三人当选为作家协会中央理事会理事；二十九人当选为监察委员会委员。
