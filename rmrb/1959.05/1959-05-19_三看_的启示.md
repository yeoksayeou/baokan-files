Enlightenment from the "Three Looks"
    Changchun

Last year, many cotton farmers in Shaanxi Province achieved high yields after learning and applying Zhang Qiuxiang's advanced experience. However, some who learned her experience did not achieve high yields. Why? The problem turned out to be rigid application.

Someone asked Zhang Qiuxiang why their cotton was not as good as hers even after learning her experience. Zhang Qiuxiang smiled and said, "My experience may not be entirely applicable in your area. To greatly increase cotton production this year on the basis of last year, even I feel that last year's experience is not enough and needs to be continuously improved according to the new situation." She also said, "Cotton planting experience cannot be rigidly applied, but requires looking at the sky, looking at the land, and looking at the cotton, and applying it flexibly. Among these, looking at the cotton is the most important."

What wonderful words! Don't think Zhang Qiuxiang is just a "rustic" who has not studied Marxist philosophy; in actual production, her application of dialectics is much better than our bookworms. The "three looks" she mentioned, I think, are the essence of her cotton planting experience and the key to her continuously improving high-yield records.

The "sky, land, and seedlings" that Zhang Qiuxiang mentioned are things, objective existences; looking, is to treat objective things with a dialectical attitude. Everything must shift with time, place, and conditions. Field management cannot be separated from the three words "sky, land, and seedlings." Taking fertilization as an example, we must look at whether the seedlings are thin, strong, yellow, or green, and then decide how much fertilizer to apply and what kind of fertilizer to apply; we must also look at the land, and different soil types require different components and amounts of fertilizer; we must also look at the sky, and sunny, rainy, cold, hot, early, and late weather also have a relationship with fertilization. The "sky, land, and seedlings" are interconnected, and the seedlings are the main aspect among them.

"Three Looks" is Zhang Qiuxiang's dialectics of cotton planting, the source of her "skill." Zhang Qiuxiang has a high degree of revolutionary zeal, and with this "skill" of hers, she reaps the fruits of high yield. Some people have the subjective desire to strive for high yields and also have the spirit of hard work, but lack this kind of "skill"; or although they have gone to learn Zhang Qiuxiang's "skill" scriptures, they have not learned the essence of her "skill," so the result is still not "skillful" and they cannot achieve high-yield targets.

Why is it that some people still are not "skillful" even after learning Zhang Qiuxiang's "skill"? The answer: "Sky, land, and seedlings" are not exactly the same. Things are constantly changing and developing; here and there are different, today and yesterday are also different; any theory or experience is obtained at a specific time, in a specific space, and under specific conditions. If it is regarded as applicable at any time, place, and condition, and rigidly applied everywhere, it is as absurd as trying to raise chickens like ducks, driving the chickens into the pond.

Speaking of this, some people may say: Since things are constantly changing, then there is no need to learn the theories and experiences of others. No! Look at the example of another cotton farmer in Shaanxi Province, Xue Junxiu: Xue Junxiu caught up with Zhang Qiuxiang last year. How did she catch up? In her own words: "It was because we learned from Teacher Qiuxiang's experience that we were able to catch up with her." However, the reason she was able to catch up with Zhang Qiuxiang was not only this; there was also: "We learned Teacher Qiuxiang's experience, but not rigidly. After learning it, we studied it collectively and made appropriate changes based on our own actual situation." It can be seen that advanced theories and experiences must still be learned, and the only question is how to apply them in conjunction with reality after learning them. Whoever combines with reality will achieve results; whoever does not combine with reality will take detours.

    “三看”的启示
    长春
    去年，很多陕西省的棉农在学习和运用了张秋香的先进经验后，获得了高产。然而，也有学了她的经验并未得到高产的。为什么？原来毛病就出在死搬硬套上面。
    有人问张秋香，为什么学了她的经验，棉花仍不如她的好。张秋香笑着说：“我的经验，在你们那里不一定完全适用。今年棉花要在去年的基础上大增产，连我自己也觉得去年的经验不够用了，要根据新情况继续改进。”她还说：“植棉经验不能死搬硬套，而要看天看地看棉花，灵活地运用。这中间，看棉花又是最重要的一条。”
    多么精彩的话！莫看张秋香是个“老粗”，没有研究过马克思主义哲学，她在实际生产中运用辩证法，比我们的书呆子们强得多了。她说的“三看”，我以为实是其植棉经验的精髓，也是她连年不断提高丰产纪录的关键。
    张秋香说的“天、地、苗”，就是物，就是客观存在；看，就是要用辩证法的态度对待客观事物。一切事物要以时间、地点、条件为转移，田间管理就离不了“天、地、苗”三个字。拿施肥来说，就要看苗瘦苗壮苗黄苗青，然后决定下多少肥和什么肥；还要看地，不同的土质，就要下不同成分和数量的肥；还要看天，晴雨冷热早晚，和施肥也有关系。“天、地、苗”三者是互相联系的，而苗又是其中的主要方面。
    “三看”，是张秋香植棉的辩证法，是她的“巧”之所在。张秋香有着高度的革命干劲，加上她这个“巧”，便结出了高产的果实。有些人虽有力争高产的主观愿望，也有苦干的精神，但缺乏这种“巧”；或者虽然去学了张秋香的“巧”经，然而没有学到她的“巧”之所在，所以结果也还是不“巧”，不能实现高产的指标。
    为什么张秋香的“巧”，有人学了仍不“巧”呢？曰：“天、地、苗”不尽相同也。事物千变万化、不断发展，这儿和那儿不同，今天和昨天也不同；任何理论或经验，都是在特定时间、特定空间、特定条件下取得的。如果把它看成是在任何时间、地点、条件下都适用的，到处死搬硬套，恰如硬要像养鸭那样养鸡，把鸡赶到池塘里去一样的荒唐。
    说到这里，也许有人会说：既然事物千变万化，那么别人的理论和经验都用不着学了。不！看看陕西省另一棉农薛俊秀的例子吧：薛俊秀去年赶上了张秋香，她怎么赶上的？用她自己的话说：“是我们学了秋香老师的经验，才使我们赶上了她的。”然而使她能赶上张秋香的原因，并不仅此而已；还有：“我们学秋香老师的经验，不是死搬硬套的，学回来后集体研究，根据自己的实际情况，作适当的改变。”可见，先进的理论和经验，也还是必须学习的，问题只在学后要结合实际地运用。谁结合实际，谁就能作出成绩；谁不结合实际，谁就会走弯路。
