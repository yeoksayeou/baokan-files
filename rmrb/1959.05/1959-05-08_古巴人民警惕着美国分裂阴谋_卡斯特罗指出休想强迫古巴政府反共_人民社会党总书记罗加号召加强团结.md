　　Cuban People Vigilant Against American Conspiracy to Split Nation
    Castro States No Forcing of Cuban Government to be Anti-Communist
    People's Socialist Party General Secretary Roca Calls for Strengthening Unity
    Xinhua News Agency, May 6th: Montevideo dispatch: Cuban Prime Minister Castro refuted the claim by American propaganda machines on the 4th in the capital of Uruguay that Cuba is becoming a "communist beachhead" in the Caribbean. When a local reporter mentioned that the American Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS) program said this, Castro dismissed it with a smile, saying, "It's not even worth answering" this question.
    A United Press International dispatch from Montevideo stated that Castro immediately added, "It seems there is an attempt to force Cuba to eliminate and arrest communists, which we will not do, because Cuba now practices true democracy, where all ideologies are respected."
    When a reporter asked which side Cuba would be on if a war broke out between the East and West, Castro replied that, as far as he was concerned, people should talk about peace instead of war. But in terms of "war," he said, the Cuban government's principle is to support just wars.
    Castro said that Cuba pursues a policy of non-interference in the internal affairs of any other country and strives for the unity of the people of Latin American countries.
    Xinhua News Agency, Havana, May 6th: The Cuban newspaper "Hoy" published the television broadcast speech made by the General Secretary of the Cuban People's Socialist Party, Roca, on the 4th. In his speech, Roca called for strengthening unity to smash the conspiracies of domestic and foreign reactionaries.
    Roca called on all revolutionaries and trade unions to unite, because a united trade union movement is the best guarantee to keep the revolution unharmed, unretreating, and undefeated. Roca pointed out that the left needs to unite to advance the revolution, and at the same time, they also demand unity with the center, and at certain times with the right, because the task of all factions is the same during certain periods.
    Roca said that the purpose of the Cuban revolution is not to establish a right-wing or left-wing class dictatorship. He said that the Cuban revolutionary government represents the current revolutionary classes, including farmers, workers, and various middle classes. Roca condemned the claim that communists have infiltrated the Cuban government. He said that the People's Socialist Party stands where it should be, standing where it is needed to advance the revolution.
    Xinhua News Agency, Havana, May 6th: The slanderous television program broadcast by the New York Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS) on the 3rd, which smeared Cuba, aroused unparalleled indignation in the Havana press and among the Cuban people. The CBS television program on the 3rd stated that a totalitarian dictatorship now exists in Cuba, and that Cuba is moving towards communism.
    After the first slander campaign by the American imperialist press against Cuba's execution of war criminals, they are now launching a new slander in an attempt to split the unity of the Cuban people.
    The Cuban "Revolución," the organ of the July 26th Movement, reported that hundreds of Cuban expatriates living in the United States rushed to the CBS building to protest without waiting for the end of this despicable program to slander Cuba. The Cuban representative to the United Nations and the ambassador to Washington also protested.
    "Revolución" pointed out today when publishing the full text of the above program that the full text is reprinted so that all Cuban people can have sufficient understanding of the slander campaign against Cuba abroad. "Revolución" pointed out that the American imperialist press "is serving the most despicable interests, and these people are mobilizing against the Cuban revolution."
    The Cuban "Hoy" pointed out that the real reason for the slander by the American Columbia Broadcasting System is still the policy of American imperialism to suppress the Cuban revolution. This newspaper said that facing the second round of slander and provocation, the Cuban people have only one path: that is, unity.

　　古巴人民警惕着美国分裂阴谋
    卡斯特罗指出休想强迫古巴政府反共
    人民社会党总书记罗加号召加强团结
    新华社6日讯　蒙得维的亚消息：古巴总理卡斯特罗4日在乌拉圭首都驳斥美国宣传机器攻击古巴正在变成加勒比海的“共产主义滩头堡”的说法。一个当地记者向卡斯特罗提到美国哥伦比亚广播公司的宣传节目中曾经这样说过时，卡斯特罗置之一笑，他说，“根本不值得回答”这个问题。
    合众国际社从蒙得维的亚发出的一条消息说，但是，卡斯特罗随即补充说，“似乎有一种要强迫古巴消灭和逮捕共产党人的企图，而我们是不会这样做的，因为古巴现在（实行的）是真正的民主，一切意识形态在这里都受到尊重。”
    有记者问，如果东西方之间发生战争古巴将站在哪一边，卡斯特罗回答说，照他看来，人们应该谈论和平，而不应该去谈论战争。但是就“战争”而言，他说，古巴政府的原则是支持正义的战争。
    卡斯特罗说，古巴奉行不干涉任何其他国家的内政和争取拉丁美洲各国人民团结的政策。
    新华社哈瓦那6日电　古巴“今日报”6日刊登了古巴人民社会党总书记罗加在4日发表的电视广播演说。罗加在演说中号召加强团结，粉碎国内外反动分子的阴谋活动。
    罗加号召一切革命者和工会团结起来，因为团结一致的工会运动是使革命不受损害、不后退、不被击败的最好保证。罗加指出，左派需要团结起来推进革命，同时他们也要求与中派团结，并且在一定的时候与右派团结，因为在一定的时期内一切派别的任务都是共同的。
    罗加说，古巴革命的目的不是要建立一个右派的或左派的阶级专政。他说，古巴革命政府代表目前的各个革命阶级，包括农民、工人和各个中层阶级。罗加谴责了所谓共产党渗入古巴政府的说法。他说，人民社会党站在它应该站的岗位上，站在为了推进革命需要它的地方。
    新华社哈瓦那6日电　纽约哥伦比亚广播公司3日广播的污蔑古巴的电视节目，激起了哈瓦那报界和古巴人民的无比愤慨。纽约哥伦比亚广播公司3日的电视节目说，古巴现在存在着一个极权主义的独裁政权，古巴正向共产主义前进。
    美帝国主义的报刊在反对古巴枪决战犯的第一次诽谤运动后，现在又发动新的诽谤，企图分裂古巴人民的团结。
    古巴7月26日运动机关报“革命报”报道说，旅居美国的古巴侨民数百人没有等这个诋毁古巴的卑鄙节目结束，就赶到哥伦比亚广播公司大厦表示抗议。古巴驻联合国代表驻华盛顿大使也提出了抗议。
    “革命报”今天在发表上述节目全文时指出，转载全文是为了使全体古巴人民对于国外反对古巴的诽谤运动有足够的了解。“革命报”指出，美帝国主义的报界“是为最卑鄙的利益效劳的，这些人正在动员起来反对古巴革命”。
    古巴“今日报”指出，美国哥伦比亚广播公司进行污蔑的真正原因还是美帝国主义坚持镇压古巴革命的政策。这家报纸说，面对着第二回合的诽谤和挑衅，古巴人民只有一条道路：那就是团结。
