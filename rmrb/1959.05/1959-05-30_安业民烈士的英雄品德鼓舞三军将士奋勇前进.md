    Heroic and Tenacious, Selfless for the Public Good
    Martyr An Yemin's Heroic Qualities Inspire the Three Services to Advance Courageously
    Xinhua News Agency, 29th - The broad masses of officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army are studying with boundless respect the noble qualities of An Yemin, the hero of the fiery battle and a communist fighter with unwavering loyalty. They are determined to take An Yemin as their model and better complete the tasks in their respective posts.
    An Yemin was a gunner in a coastal artillery unit of the People's Navy. Last summer, when the Chiang Kai-shek troops on Jinmen constantly bombarded our coastal villages and towns, An Yemin, like the vast numbers of officers and soldiers, harbored deep anger and was ready at any time to avenge the suffering people. On August 23rd, the order to severely punish the Chiang Kai-shek troops was issued. An Yemin suppressed the excitement in his heart and operated the steering wheel of the coastal artillery with absolute precision. The battle began, and thousands of rockets flew across the strait, hitting and setting enemy ships on fire. At this moment, an enemy shell suddenly landed to the left rear of the artillery piece operated by An Yemin, igniting the propellant charges and causing a raging fire. If the gun body was not quickly rotated, it would be damaged immediately. An Yemin gripped the steering wheel and turned the gun body violently. In this critical moment, flames engulfed the gun and An Yemin himself. By the time he had turned the gun to a concealed position, he had become a human torch, his hair and eyebrows singed, his sweat-soaked shirt almost burned to ashes and stuck to his skin. He fainted for a moment. When he awoke, disregarding the repeated dissuasion of the political commissar and comrades, he ran to his gun position with his burnt body and rejoined the battle. His burned arm stuck to the steering wheel, and yellowish fluid streamed from his charred body. His eyes were so swollen that he could barely open them, but he fulfilled his combat duties accurately and quickly with steely will. When enemy ships in Liaoluo Bay had been sunk and damaged and the battle was victoriously concluded, he was sent to the hospital for treatment. In the hospital, his condition continued to deteriorate, and the pain was excruciating, but he still worried about his comrades on the front lines and the victory of the battle. When the soldiers came to see him, he always gritted his teeth, endured the pain, and said that he would soon be able to return to the company, urging everyone to maintain their honor and create even greater victories. As he lay dying, he murmured, "Comrade gun commander, the artillery has been cleaned, please inspect it..." This twenty-year-old Youth League member, from a peasant background and enlisted in 1957, heroically gave his life for the people.
    The Chinese Communist Party Committee of the Navy, in order to commend the noble qualities of this heroic coastal artillery soldier, posthumously admitted him as a full member of the Chinese Communist Party, in accordance with his wishes during his lifetime. The Navy and the political departments of the troops in the Shenyang area have issued special instructions, calling on all officers and soldiers to learn from the heroic actions and noble qualities of Martyr An Yemin. General Tan Zheng, Director of the General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, wrote an article mourning the martyr. The article stated: Taking the interests of the Party and the interests of the people as one's highest interests, caring for the revolution, caring for the collective, and caring for comrades more than oneself are the excellent qualities of the people's soldiers educated by the Party; a heroic, tenacious, and indomitable fighting style, determined to overwhelm the enemy and never be subjugated by any enemy, is the glorious tradition of the people's army led by the Party. An Yemin on the Fujian front, as well as countless revolutionary martyrs such as Dong Cunrui in the Liberation War and Huang Jiguang in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, possessed these qualities and inherited this tradition. Our People's Liberation Army soldiers should be inspired by the deeds of Comrade An Yemin, carry forward this selfless spirit, and enable our cause to achieve greater victories.
    The vast number of officers and soldiers in the army are studying An Yemin's noble qualities with infinite admiration. The coastal artillery company where An Yemin served during his lifetime launched the "An Yemin Red Flag" competition, achieving outstanding results in various tasks. A certain naval fleet patrolling the sea day and night, after studying the heroic deeds of Martyr An Yemin, heroically and tenaciously overcame the violent storms on the sea, and also achieved excellent results in recent night shooting exercises. A certain engineering unit in the Beijing area, performing engineering tasks, under the inspiration of An Yemin's communist thought, launched a large-scale construction collaboration, improved work efficiency, and completed the task ahead of schedule.

### 安业民烈士的英雄品德鼓舞三军将士奋勇前进

    英勇顽强　舍己为公
    安业民烈士的英雄品德鼓舞三军将士奋勇前进
    新华社29日讯　中国人民解放军广大官兵以无比崇敬的心情，学习战斗烈火中的英雄、赤胆忠心的共产主义战士安业民烈士的高贵品德，决心以安业民为榜样，更好地完成各个岗位上的任务。
    安业民是人民海军某海岸炮兵的瞄准手。去年夏天，金门蒋军不断炮击我沿海村镇时，安业民和广大官兵一样怀着满腔怒火，随时准备为受害人民报仇雪恨。8月23日，严惩蒋军的命令下达了，安业民抑制着心头的激动，分毫不差地操纵着海岸大炮的方向盘。战斗开始了，千百道火箭飞过海峡，敌舰被击中起火。这时，敌人射来的一发炮弹突然落到安业民操纵的大炮左后方，药包被打着了，燃起熊熊大火，炮身如不迅速转动立即就要受到损失。安业民紧握方向盘，猛转炮身。在这紧急时刻里，火焰扑上炮身，也扑到安业民的身上。等他把炮身转到隐蔽位置的时候，他已经成了火人，头发、眉毛烧焦了，几乎烧成灰烬的汗衫和皮肉粘在一起。他一阵昏迷倒了下去。当他苏醒过来时，不顾政委和战友们的一再阻劝，光着烧伤的身子，奔上炮位，又参加了战斗。他烧伤的胳臂和方向盘粘到一起了，烧焦了的全身直淌黄水，眼睛也肿得睁不开了，但他以钢铁一样的意志准确迅速地履行着战斗职责。当料罗湾的敌舰被击沉、击伤，战斗胜利结束的时候，他被送到医院治疗。在医院里，他的伤势不断恶化，剧痛难忍，可是他还念念不忘前线的战友和战斗的胜利。战士们来看望他，他总是咬着牙，忍着痛，说自己很快就可以回到连队，嘱咐大家保持荣誉，创造更大的胜利。在他临终的时候，嘴里喃喃地说着：“炮长同志，火炮已经擦好，请你检查……”这位年仅二十，农民出身，1957年入伍的共青团员就这样英勇地为人民献出自己的生命。
    中共海军党委为表彰这位英雄的海岸炮兵战士的崇高品质，根据他生前的愿望，追认他为中共正式党员。海军和沈阳地区部队等部队政治部专门发出指示，号召全体官兵学习安业民烈士的英雄行为和高贵品德。中国人民解放军总政治部主任谭政大将曾撰文悼念烈士。文章写道：以党的利益、人民的利益为自己最高的利益，关心革命、关心集体、关心同志甚于关心自己，是党教育下的人民战士的优美品德；英勇顽强、坚韧不拔、要压倒敌人，而决不被任何敌人所屈服的战斗作风，是党领导的人民军队的光荣传统。福建前线的安业民以及解放战争中的董存瑞、抗美援朝战争中的黄继光等无数革命先烈就具备了这些品德，继承了这个传统。我们解放军战士应当从安业民同志的事迹里得到鼓舞，发扬这种忘我精神，使我们的事业获得更大的胜利。
    部队广大官兵怀着无限敬仰的心情，学习着安业民的高贵品德。安业民生前所在的海岸炮兵连，曾开展“安业民红旗”竞赛，在各项工作上都取得了优异成绩。日夜在海上巡逻的某海军舰队，学习了安业民烈士英雄事迹后，英勇顽强地战胜了海上的狂风巨浪，在最近夜间射击中也取得了优秀成绩。北京地区执行工程任务的某工兵部队，在安业民共产主义思想激励下，展开了施工大协作，提高了工作效率，提前完成了任务。（附图片）
