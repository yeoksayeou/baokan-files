　　Having come to Hong'an County, my greatest wish was to visit and learn from the experimental fields cultivated by the comrades here. The hosts, understanding our sentiments completely, hadn't even allowed us to put down our bags before the responsible comrade from the County Committee enthusiastically began talking about their experimental fields and promised to send someone to guide us on a visit.

　　The next morning, we followed the guide towards the east of Hong'an City. Hong'an County town is small; a few steps and we were out of the city, the undulating hills beginning to the east. The guide pointed to a hill in front and said, "There, that's Five-Harvest Hill. The experimental fields of the County Committee are located there."

　　We looked ahead in the direction the comrade indicated. Ah! What a beautiful Five-Harvest Hill! It was a hill at the foot of a mountain, with a small, perennial river flowing in front. The willows along the riverbank were already sprouting tender leaves, and various wildflowers – red, yellow, purple – were scattered across the ground. The wheat in the experimental fields on the hill was already over three feet tall, forming a green ocean. The rapeseed grew even better, its shimmering yellow flowers standing out even more beautifully amidst the lush green wheat fields. At the same time, the sun joined in the spectacle, its pale red morning glow gently painting the earth of spring. All this made Five-Harvest Hill look like a beautiful painting.

　　We quickened our pace and arrived at the hill. The entire hill was covered with experimental field signs. This place used to be a desolate hill, with only a few families living here, so it was originally called Five-House Hill. The past Five-House Hill was a barren wasteland with poor soil. Although some crops were planted, the harvests were very poor, yielding only a few dozen or a hundred catties per mu. Since 1957, this hill has undergone tremendous changes. That spring, the Party called on cadres to participate in and lead production. Therefore, Cheng Peng, the First Secretary of the Hong'an County Committee of the Communist Party of China, and other responsible cadres of the County Committee, took off their shoes and socks, picked up hoes, and came to this hill. They combined their efforts with technicians and experienced farmers to sow seeds on the coarse, sandy soil and planted the earliest agricultural experimental field of our country's cadres. As a result, for the first time ever, the crops on this barren land yielded a bumper harvest. At the same time, the entire county also achieved a bumper harvest. Subsequently, this place became a sacred site. People from home and abroad came here to learn the "secret," and countless footprints were imprinted on this hill, and countless amazed eyes gazed upon this land. Moreover, like a rising wind and surging clouds, the flowers of experimental fields quickly bloomed in every corner of the country. As a result, agricultural production across the country leaped forward, industrial production leaped forward... our entire nation leaped forward. Five-House Hill became the first stepping stone on the path of being both red and expert for our Party's millions of cadres, a heroic hill that will always be worth commemorating.

　　However, the original name, Five-House Hill, could no longer objectively reflect the rapidly changing face of the area. It had become a symbol of abundant harvests. Therefore, the comrades who cultivated the experimental fields discussed it and changed the name to Five-Harvest Hill. The meaning is obvious: to transform the desolate hill into a hill of abundant harvests, to turn barren land into a paradise of happiness for the people.

　　Now, Five-Harvest Hill is like a large garden, or a scientific research institute. Based on years of experience, the cadres in the experimental fields have made this year's experiments even more diverse. Now, each of the wheat and rapeseed experimental fields has its own characteristics: different densities, different seasons, different fertilization methods... all of which are recorded in detail. When we arrived, the owners of the experimental fields were building windbreaks at the edge of a highly densely planted wheat experimental field to prevent the wheat from lodging. This wheat has over one million plants per mu, has already grown to be more than half a person tall, and has already headed. In front of the wheat and rapeseed experimental fields, there is also a large area of ​​neat and lovely apple and pear trees, which have already sprouted green leaves. In another half a month, they will blossom, and this year they will bear clusters of fruit on the trees.

　　五丰岗
　　海波
    来到红安县，最大的愿望是参观学习这里同志们种的试验田。大概主人们完全理解我们的心情，进门后还没有来得及放下手提包，县委负责同志就热情地谈起他们的试验田了。并且答应派人领着我们去参观。
    第二天一大早，我们随着带路的同志，向红安城东走去。红安县城很小，几步路就出了城，东面便是起伏相连的山岗。引路的同志用手指着前面的一个山岗说：“哪，那就是五丰岗，县委同志的试验田就在那里。”
    我们顺着这位同志的手向前看去，啊！好一个美丽的五丰岗！这是在一个山脚下面的山岗，岗前一条小河，河水终年不断，河边的杨柳已经吐出嫩叶，各种野花红的、黄的、紫的、斑斑点点星散满地。山岗上试验田里的小麦已有三尺多高，成为一片绿色海洋了。油菜长得更好，它那闪闪发光的黄色花儿，在翠绿欲滴的麦田之间，显得更加好看。同时，太阳也来凑热闹，那淡红色的朝霞正把自己的光彩轻轻抹在春天的大地上。这一切把五丰岗装饰得活像一幅美丽的图画。
  我们加快了脚步，来到了山岗上。整个山岗到处插满了试验田的牌子。这里原来是一个荒凉的山岗，只有几户人家，所以原来叫作五房岗。过去的五房岗是个土质很坏的荒山野坡，虽然有些地方种上了庄稼，但收成很差，每亩不过几十斤百把斤。从1957年起，这个山岗发生了巨大变化。那年春天，党号召干部参加生产领导生产。于是中共红安县委第一书记程鹏和其他一些县委负责干部，脱了鞋袜，拿起锄头来到这个山岗上，与技术人员和老农结合起来，在那粗沙薄地上撒下种子，种下了我国干部的最早的一块农业试验田。结果，这块薄地的庄稼破天荒第一次获得了丰收，同时，全县也获得了丰收。接着，这块地方就简直成了圣地，从国内到国外，前来这里取“经”的人络绎不绝，不知有多少万人的脚印印在这个山岗上，不知有多少万人的惊奇的眼睛看这块土地。而且有如风起云涌的试验田之花迅速开遍了全国每个角落。于是，全国农业生产大跃进了，工业生产大跃进了……我们整个国家大跃进了。五房岗成了我们党千百万干部又红又专道路上的第一块阶石，成了一个永远值得纪念的英雄的山岗。
    但是，原来的五房岗这个名字已经不能客观反映迅速改变着的面貌了。它已成了五谷丰登的象征。因此，种试验田的同志商量了一下，就把这里改为五丰岗。意思是明显的：把荒凉的山岗变成五谷丰登的山岗，把不毛之地变成人民幸福的乐园。
    现在，五丰岗像一个大花园，又像一个科学研究所。根据几年来的经验，试验田的干部今年把各种试验搞得更加丰富多采。现在的小麦和油菜试验田，每一块都有自己的特点：密度不同，季节不同，施肥不同……这一切都有详细纪录。我们来到这里时，试验田的主人正在一块高度密植的小麦试验田的田头搭挡风墙，以防小麦倒伏。这块小麦每亩一百多万株，已长得大半人高，已经抽穗了。在小麦、油菜试验田的前面，还有一大片长得整齐可爱，已经吐出绿叶的苹果树、梨树，再有半月就会开花，今年就可以在树上结出累累的水果了。
