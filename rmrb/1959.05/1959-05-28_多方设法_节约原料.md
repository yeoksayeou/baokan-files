Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, May 27th: The Shanghai Radio Equipment Factory, after mobilizing the masses to speak out freely and oppose waste, and further establishing and improving the material management system, has rapidly reduced the consumption of various raw materials. At present, the loss rate of major materials such as plexiglass, resistors, coils, and intermediate frequency transformers has been reduced from about 20% to about 5%, saving a large amount of materials.
    The factory's movement to oppose waste developed from the inventory clearance campaign. In late April, the factory mobilized the masses to clear the warehouse and found a large number of materials urgently needed for production were stockpiled, and the material management system was very unsound. Based on this situation, the factory's Party organization launched the masses to speak out freely. It further exposed loopholes in material management and calculated the losses caused by material waste and other reasons in the fourth quarter of last year and the first quarter of this year, which educated the masses and the leaders. On this basis, the factory's Party and government leaders, together with the staff of the departments and workers, discussed and established a complete set of management systems from the entry of raw materials into the factory, inspection, to the workshop's material requisition and return. It achieved "setting up checkpoints at every level" to block loopholes in waste.
    In the past, the material management department rarely inspected the incoming materials, and sent them to the workshop regardless of whether they were qualified or not; after the material inspection system was established, seven inspection personnel were set up to be responsible for this work, making the materials entering the workshop qualified and usable. In order to change the original phenomenon of issuing as much material as the workshop requested, a quota system for material requisition was established this time. The material management personnel should issue materials according to the amount of materials used for the product and the quantity of production; the designers also prepared a list of materials required for each product and issued it to the relevant workshops and material management departments; as the basis for requisitioning and issuing materials.
    After opposing waste and further establishing and improving the system, it is now rare to find materials scattered on the ground in the workshop. At the entrances and exits of the workshop, there are "scrap boxes" where workers put the remaining scraps and broken materials into the box after work every day. Many workers also sort and return the remaining parts to the warehouse after work. The administrator of the assembly workshop used spare time to repair thousands of "band switches" that had been scrapped in the past, saving the factory seven or eight thousand yuan.

Xinhua News Agency, Yumen, May 27th: Yumen Oil Mine adopts various methods to increase revenue and reduce expenditure, so that the supply of equipment and materials meets the needs of continuous leaps in crude oil production.
    In terms of "reducing expenditure", the measures they take are to use waste and old materials, use substitutes, reduce material consumption, strengthen equipment maintenance, and so on. By using these methods, the machinery factory saved more than 80 tons of steel in more than three months. The staff of the Geological Exploration Company used various specifications of gas pipes instead of oil well casings, so that more than 100 new oil wells were put into production in a timely manner. As crude oil production continued to increase, the oil storage tanks were insufficient. The staff of the Oilfield Construction Engineering Company built six large storage pools with bricks, stones, wood, etc. instead of steel plates, on the premise of not causing losses to the crude oil. One of the storage pools that has been built can store 20,000 tons of oil, saving 350 tons of steel plates.
    In terms of "increasing revenue", they mainly rely on their own efforts to run some factories and produce some raw materials, materials and equipment themselves. Since the beginning of this year, the factories run by the whole mine have produced in batches 26 kinds of products such as drill bits, deep well pumps, calcium carbide, and welding rods, which are important equipment urgently needed for drilling, oil production, and oilfield construction. Among them, the output of drill bits alone in the four months of this year was four times more than the output of the whole year last year, which guaranteed the progress of drilling work. At present, Yumen Oil Mine is building 11 factories for steel wire ropes, barite, cement, rubber parts, drilling and mining equipment, etc., to produce more equipment for drilling, oil production, and oilfield construction.
    Thanks to the guarantee of equipment and material supply, the total crude oil production of Yumen Oil Mine in the first quarter increased by nearly 100% compared with the same period last year; in April, the production plans of the whole mine in drilling, oil production, and oil refining were overfulfilled.

Xinhua News Agency, Lushun-Dalian, May 27th: Dalian Foundry has long been using a part of waste materials for production, turning many discarded materials in the society into good materials and machines.
    From last year to April this year, the factory used a total of 12,090 tons of recycled iron and 180 tons of non-ferrous metals from iron filings, iron mud, and broken copper and scrap iron, and used these steels to manufacture many products such as cast iron valves, lead-lined valves, acid-resistant pumps, and high-tin pumps to support the production and construction of more than 100 units; it also produced various pots, spoons, stoves and other daily necessities to supply the market. Due to the use of waste materials for production, the factory's cost has been reduced by 37.1%.
    In the past, most of the iron filings, iron mud and other scrap iron from factories in Lushun-Dalian were used to fill ditches and reclaim the sea. This was a great waste. In order to utilize these waste materials, Dalian Foundry once organized special personnel to conduct experiments for more than two months, and learned from continuous failures and found a way to use waste materials for production. They used scrap iron to make iron pots, but the quality was not good at first; later, they improved the furnace equipment, increased the melting rate and reduced the sulfur content of the iron, so that the scrap rate was reduced from 60-70% in the past to 5%.

    多方设法  节约原料
    上海无线电器材厂发动群众反浪费
    玉门油矿开源节流保证了器材供应
    大连铸造厂用铁屑废料生产日用品
    新华社上海27日电  上海无线电器材厂经过发动群众大鸣大放，反对浪费，进一步建立和健全了材料管理制度后，各种原材料的损耗量迅速下降。目前，有机玻璃、电阻、线圈、中周变压器等主要材料的损耗率，已从20％降低到5％左右，节约了大批材料。
    这个工厂反对浪费的运动，是从清仓运动发展起来的。4月下旬，这个厂发动群众清理仓库，发现仓库里积压了大批生产上急需的材料，材料管理制度很不健全。根据这一情况，工厂党组织便发动职工群众大鸣大放。进一步揭发材料管理上的漏洞，并且计算了去年第四季度和今年第一季度因为材料浪费等原因所造成的损失，既教育了群众，也教育了领导。在此基础上，工厂党政领导就和科室人员、工人们共同讨论，建立了从原材料进厂、检验到车间领料、退料一整套管理制度。做到“关关设卡”，堵塞浪费漏洞。
    过去，材料管理部门对进厂的材料很少检验，不管合格不合格都送进车间；建立了材料检验制度后，设置了七个检验人员负责这一工作，使进车间的材料合格好用。为了改变原来车间领料，要多少发多少的现象，这次建立了限额领料的制度，材料管理人员要根据产品的用料和生产的数量多寡发给材料；设计人员还拟订了每种产品需用材料的名单，发给各有关车间和材料管理部门；作为领发材料的根据。
    经过反对浪费，进一步建立和健全制度后，现在，车间里很少发现材料散失在地面的情况。车间的出入口处，放置着“零头箱”，工人们每天下工后就把剩下来的零料、碎料投入箱内。许多工人还在下工后把剩余的零件，分门归类地送回仓库。装配车间的管理员利用空余时间，把过去报废的几千只“波段开关”修复使用，为工厂节约了七、八千元。
    新华社玉门27日电  玉门油矿采用各种办法开源节流，使设备器材的供应满足了原油生产不断跃进的需要。
    在“节流”方面，他们采取的办法是利用废旧料，使用代用品，减少材料消耗，加强设备的维护保养等等。机械厂运用这些办法，在三个多月内节约了八十多吨钢材。地质勘探公司职工用规格不同的瓦斯管代替油井套管，使一百多口新油井及时投入了生产。随着原油产量不断提高，储油罐感到不足，油田建设工程公司的职工们在不使原油受损失的前提下，用砖石、木头等代替钢板兴建六个大型储油池，已建成的一个储油池能储油两万吨，节省钢板三百五十吨。
    在“开源”方面，他们主要是自力更生地举办一些工厂，自制一部分原料、材料和器材。今年以来，全矿自办的工厂已成批地生产出钻头、深井泵、电石、电焊条等二十六种产品，这些都是钻井、采油、油田建设中急需的重要器材。其中仅钻头一项，今年四个月的产量就比去年全年的产量多四倍，保证了钻井工作的进行。目前，玉门油矿正在兴建钢丝绳、重晶石、水泥、橡胶配件、钻采设备等十一个工厂，生产更多的钻井、采油、油田建设用的器材。
    由于设备、器材的供应有了保证，玉门油矿第一季度的原油总产量比去年同期增加了近一倍；4月份，全矿的钻井、采油、炼油等方面的生产计划，都超额完成了。
    据新华社旅大27日电  大连铸造厂长期利用一部分废料进行生产，把社会上许多废弃物资变成了良材和机器。
    这个厂从去年到今年4月，共用铁屑、铁泥和破铜烂铁等废料，炼出了一万二千零九十吨再生铁和一百八十多吨有色金属，并且利用这些钢铁制造了铸铁阀、衬铅阀、耐酸泵、高锡泵等许多产品，支援了一百多个单位的生产建设；制出了各种锅、勺、炉子等人民生活用品供应市场。由于利用废料生产，这个厂的成本降低了37.1％。
    过去，旅大市各工厂的铁屑、铁泥和其他杂铁，大部分都被用来垫沟填海。这是一个很大的浪费。大连铸造厂为了利用这些废料，曾经组织专人进行了两个多月的试验，从不断失败中吸取了经验，找到了利用废料生产的办法。他们使用废铁造铁锅，开始时质量不好；后来改进了大炉设备，提高熔化率降低铁的含硫量，使废品率由过去百分之六、七十降低到5％。
