　　The Plight of Women and Children

　　In the afternoon of the "May 1st" Labor Day in 1956, I was in the vegetable garden of Lhasa Primary School with some Tibetan children, discussing the parade on Tiananmen Square in Beijing and the evening's carnival. Little Zhuoga wanted me to talk about what Chairman Mao was wearing; Suolangcuo wanted me to talk about what color flowers the people in the parade were holding. Suddenly, a miserable cry of a woman, a mixture of crying and shouting, came. We immediately stopped talking. Looking up, under a poplar tree next to the Yutuo Bridge, two fierce men pinned down a middle-aged woman, and another Tibetan official in a yellow robe stood aside, shouting like a madman: "Beat her hard, beat her hard! See if she dares to disobey her master's orders!" They were vigorously whipping the woman with a long bamboo board. My eyes were blurred with tears, and my heart was pounding. I only heard the crackling sound of the bamboo board and the smaller and smaller wails. "What crime did this woman commit? Does she deserve such a beating just because she didn't listen to her serf owner? Lhasa, why isn't there any legal punishment for beating people in the street?"
　　In spring, the willows in Lhasa Linka put on green robes, and small spinach sprouted in the newly turned soil. At this time, the pupils of Lhasa Primary School wore their newly bestowed red scarves.
　　Walking on the street, the red scarf fluttered in the east wind, making the spring on the plateau even more lovely. At this time, the reactionaries became angry, grabbed the children's red scarves, as if the children had committed an unforgivable mistake, they scolded: "Don't wear it! This is the Communist Party's flag!" Alas! What a strange thing, children don't even have the freedom to wear red scarves!
　　The children's hearts are red. The children's courage is great. They didn't cry when they were beaten; they didn't lose heart when they were scolded. As soon as they entered the school gate, the red scarves were tied around their necks again, fluttering in the playground and shining in the classroom.
　　Revolution is "Breaking the Law"

　　On April 22, 1956, the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region was established. Under the banner of "Unity, Progress, and Greater Development," Tibetan youth became active. In order to welcome the high tide of building a new Tibet, they bid farewell to their hometowns and parents, crossed high mountains and great rivers, and came to the Tibet Cadre School in Lhasa to study culture and politics.
　　One day, it was Sunday. I was playing cards in a tent when suddenly a few classmates ran in, their faces covered with beads of sweat, gasping for breath. One classmate said, "Several of our classmates have been arrested by Tibetan soldiers in Muru Linka." I was stunned! Why arrest students? I immediately thought of Chiang Kai-shek arresting students ten years ago, but why are Tibetan soldiers also arresting revolutionary youth?
　　A day later, through leadership negotiations, the students returned. It is said that the Tibetan soldiers even wanted to throw them into the Lhasa River! Because these students will make reforms in the future and take the socialist road.
　　There is also one thing that I will never forget. That was a Tibetan young man from Lazizong. Without telling his master, he secretly ran to Xigaze to join the revolutionary ranks. He was very happy, walking proudly on the streets of Xigaze, singing songs, wearing a newly sewn Tibetan dress, his steps particularly powerful. At this time, his master came from the opposite side. This time, the young man did not stick out his tongue, did not take off his hat, and did not look afraid at all. The following is a conversation between the master and servant:
　　"What are you doing in Xigaze?"
　　"Joining the revolution."
　　"No way. The Communist Party won't stay long, you go back quickly!"
　　"I'm not going back, I've decided to study."
　　"You are my chami, you have to provide Ula for me."
　　"My dad will replace me. Isn't that okay?"
　　The fierce landlord had no choice but to leave. I don't know what punishment he will inflict on the young man's father when he goes back? I think maybe an even heavier yoke will be put on the necks of the young man's family members, and I feel very uneasy....
　　Overnight in a Nomad's Village

　　In August, it was the season of ice and frost on the plateau snow mountains. The six of us spent a lot of effort, and the horses were exhausted and sweating all over, panting heavily, before we came to the top of Jiachuo Mountain in Xiegaerzong. There were three herding families living here in small houses built of stone. The surrounding area is rocky mountains, with green grass on the side facing the sun. The nomads' herds of cattle and sheep graze on the mountains. The old herdsman's hair was already gray, probably sixty years old; there were also several middle-aged women, wearing old sheepskins, their faces very haggard; and several children, very enthusiastic, tying our horses and making fires for us, as if they knew we would definitely be guests in his home.
　　I became friends with the old herdsman. He liked the photo of Chairman Mao and the Dalai Lama and Panchen Lama that we gave him. Although I had a headache that night, I was still drawn to the old herdsman's conversation, and I didn't want to sleep. I sat opposite the old herdsman, drinking freshly squeezed milk. The old herdsman told me: "No one used to live on this mountain. The Tibetan local government asked us to move here to watch the mountain. We have a lot of cattle and sheep, but the meat and butter have to be handed over to the master. We can't eat it ourselves. ..." The old herdsman said a lot, and I realized the reason for their haggard faces.
　　The next day, we rode our horses and walked a long way, and the old herdsman and his little grandson were still watching us.
　　The Hope of Farmers

　　In the spring of 1956, along the narrow valley of Dulongdeqingzong, I followed the agricultural loan work team to distribute interest-free loans to farmers. In my conversations with the farmers, I learned that they did not have an inch of land, and each family owed countless debts, and each family had to pay various Ula. At this time, the images of slaves in Greece and Egypt five thousand years ago appeared in my mind. I was very surprised why there were still such primitive and cruel oppression and exploitation in the twentieth century?
　　When we talked about how the Han and other ethnic groups had implemented democratic reforms, farmers had land, houses, and established factories and mines, and were advancing towards socialism, the old farmers couldn't close their mouths and laughed heartily. Especially the young people were even more joyful, they said: "Tibet should also implement reforms, and we also hope to live a happy life soon!"
　　Now, the reactionary Tibetan local government has been dissolved. I recall the past cloudy days in Tibet, and I see the newborn Tibet striding forward! My mood is like the waves of the Yarlung Zangbo River, and I seem to see a democratic socialist new Tibet as evergreen as the pine and cypress trees on the Himalayas!

　　西藏杂忆
　　耿予方
　　妇女和儿童的遭遇
    1956年“五一”劳动节的下午，我和几个藏族小朋友在拉萨小学的菜园里，正在谈论着北京天安门的游行队伍和夜晚的狂欢大会。小卓嘎要我讲讲毛主席穿着什么衣服；索南错要我谈谈游行的人手中拿着什么颜色的花。忽然，传来了一阵连哭带喊的妇女的悲惨叫声。我们立刻停止了谈话。抬头一看，在宇妥桥旁的一棵杨树下面，两个凶狠的人把一个中年妇女按倒，另一个穿着黄袍的藏族官员站在一旁，像是一个狂人一样高声吼着：“狠打，狠打！看她还敢违抗主人的命令！”他们拿着一条长长的竹板，正在狠劲地抽打那个女人。我的眼睛被泪水模糊了，我的心不停的跳动。我只听见劈拍劈拍的竹板声和越来越小的哀号。“这个妇女犯了什么罪呢？难道没有听她的农奴主的话就该遭此毒打吗？拉萨，为什么大街上打人没有受到法律制裁呢？”
    春天，拉萨林卡里的柳树披上了绿袍，新翻的土地里长出了小菠菜。这时，拉萨小学的小学生们，带着新佩上的红领巾。
    在街上走着，红领巾迎着东风飘扬，高原的春天显得更加可爱。这时，反动分子恼怒了，揪住孩子的红领巾，好像孩子犯了不可饶恕的错误一样，他们责骂着：“不准带！这是共产党的旗子！”唉呀！竟有这样的怪事，孩子们竟没有带红领巾的自由！
    孩子们的心是红的。孩子们的胆子是大的。挨了打，没有哭；挨了骂，没有丧气。刚走进学校门口，红领巾又系在脖子上，在操场里飘扬，在教室里放光。
    革命就是“犯法”
    1956年4月22日，西藏自治区筹备委员会成立了。在“团结、进步、更加发展”的旗帜下，藏族青年活跃起来了。他们为了迎接建设新西藏的高潮，告别了家乡和父母，跨过高山大河，来到了拉萨的西藏干部学校，学习文化和政治。
    一天，正是礼拜日。我在一个帐篷里玩扑克，忽然几个同学跑来，脸上冒着豆粒大的汗珠子，口中还呼呼的喘粗气，一个同学说：“我们的几个同学，在木如林卡被藏兵抓走了。”我心里怔了！为什么抓学生呢？我立刻想到十年前蒋介石抓学生的事，可是为什么藏兵也抓革命青年呢。
    过了一天，通过领导交涉，那几个学生才回来了。据说藏兵还要把他们扔到拉萨河里去哩！因为这些学生将来要闹改革，要走社会主义道路。
    还有一件事，也使我久久不忘。那是拉孜宗的一个藏族小伙子，他没有告诉主人，偷偷地跑到日喀则参加了革命队伍。他很高兴，在日喀则街上昂着头，唱着歌，穿着一身新缝的藏装，步子踏得特别有力。这时，对面来了他的主人。这次，青年人没有伸舌头，没有摘帽子，一点也没有害怕的样子。下面是主仆二人的一段对话：
    “你来日喀则干什么？”
    “参加革命。”
    “不行。共产党住不长的，你快回去！”
    “不回去，我决定学习。”
    “你是我的差民，你要给我支乌拉。”
    “我的爸爸代替我。还不行吗？”
    这个凶狠的地主没办法，只好走了。我不知道，他回去后对青年人的爸爸会施什么惩罚？我想也许一条更重的枷锁要套在青年人家庭成员的脖子上，我的心感到很不安……。
    夜宿牧民寨
    8月，高原雪山上已是冰霜季节了。我们六个人费了好大的力气，马也累得满身流汗，大喘粗气，才来到了协噶尔宗的甲错山顶，这儿有三户牧民，住在石头砌成的小房子里。周围是石头山，朝太阳的一面有青草。牧民的牛群羊群就在山上吃草。老牧民头发已经斑白，大概已有六十岁了；还有几个中年妇人，穿着老羊皮，面容很憔悴；还有几个小孩子，很热情，给我们拴马，生火，好像知道我们一定在他家里作客似的。
    我和老牧民成了朋友，他喜欢我们送给他的那一张毛主席和达赖、班禅合照的像片。晚上，我虽然头有些痛，但是我仍然被老牧民的谈话吸引着，我不想睡觉。我坐在老牧民的对面，喝着刚挤的新鲜牛奶。老牧民告诉我：“这个山，过去是没有人住的。西藏地方政府让我们搬来这儿看山。我们的牛羊很多，可是肉，酥油，要交给主人。我们自己是吃不到的。……”老牧民说了很多，我才明白了他们面容憔悴的原因。
    第二天，我们骑在马上，走了很远的一段路程，老牧民还和他的小孙子一起在望着我们。
    农民的希望
    1956年春天，我沿着都隆德钦宗的狭长的山谷，跟着农贷工作组向农民发放无息贷款。我在和农民交谈中，知道了他们没有一寸土地，而且每家都欠着数不清的债务，每家都要支付各种的乌拉。这时，我的脑子里涌现出了五千年前希腊和埃及的奴隶形象，我很奇怪为什么在二十世纪还有这样原始的残酷压迫和剥削？
    当我们谈到汉族和其他民族实行了民主改革，农民有了土地，有了房子，建立了工厂、矿山，正在向社会主义迈进的时候，老农民的嘴巴合不拢，哈哈大笑起来了。特别是那些青年人更是喜悦，他们说：“西藏也应该实行改革，我们也希望早日过上幸福生活！”
    现在，反动的西藏地方政府被解散了。我回忆起西藏过去的阴云弥漫的日子，我看着新生的西藏正在昂首阔步前进！我的心情如同雅鲁藏布江的波涛一样翻滚，我仿佛看到了一个民主的社会主义的新西藏正与喜马拉雅山上的苍松翠柏一样万年长青！
