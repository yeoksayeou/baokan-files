Good Sons and Daughters of the Tibetan People
By our reporter Yu Jingqi

    In the winter of 1950, the Ganzi Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture was officially established. Since then, the Tibetan people on this vast plateau, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, have for the first time in history gained the right to be masters of their own affairs. In the past few years, the broad masses of Tibetan people have rapidly grown into a cadre force through the education and training of the Party, the struggle to overthrow the serf owners, and the practical work of production and construction. They are all good sons and daughters of the Tibetan people.

    Always with the Masses
    Angwang Cilie from Daofu County is one of them. When the People's Liberation Army first came to the plateau, Angwang Cilie was still a poor peasant who had suffered all kinds of hardships. In the process of supporting the advancing army as a civilian worker, he was deeply moved by the People's Liberation Army soldiers' concern and care for the Tibetan people. Since then, he has actively accepted the Party's education. In 1953, he took the lead in responding to the government's call to improve technology and develop production. He was the first in the county to try planting the Nandai (Zheng) wheat variety, which yielded much higher than the local wheat, and the first to use the new-style plow, which promoted the adoption of improved varieties and new-style farm tools by many farmers. That year, he was selected as a provincial labor model. Since then, he has been a provincial people's representative.

    In order to unite the Tibetan compatriots and seek liberation, Angwang Cilie talked to his former suffering companions all night long when the democratic reforms began, pouring out past pains and publicizing the Party's policies. At that time, he was elected chairman of the peasants' association. Some feudal lords threatened to assassinate him, while others tried to buy him off, but he did not waver in the slightest. Therefore, after the democratic reforms, he was elected deputy county head by the masses.

    Over the past few years, Angwang Cilie has always maintained his excellent qualities. He often goes to the countryside to work. He picks up the plow in the fields and works with everyone, chats with them during breaks, understands various situations, solicits opinions from the masses, and patiently publicizes the Party's policies. Last year, he led the masses in overcoming a drought that had not been seen in thirty years.

    As Strong as a Rock
    In 1956, after the autonomous prefecture began democratic reforms, a rebellion was launched by some extremely reactionary feudal lords under the instigation of the reactionary upper strata in Tibet. They used all kinds of vicious means to deal with Tibetan cadres and masses who actively supported the reforms. Zhaba Aba, a Tibetan female deputy township head in Pusharong Township deep in the Zheduo Mountains, used to be a shepherd boy who was beaten by feudal lords. During the democratic reforms, she actively reported the situation to the work team and exposed their crimes of concealing property, and was therefore hated by the feudal lords. When the reactionary feudal lord Muji Azhong organized a rebellion, he suddenly attacked the work team living in Zhaba Aba's home and captured Zhaba Aba. The bandits beat her all over with clubs and gun butts. Muji Azhong forced her to hand over a work cadre living in another house. But they couldn't get anything out of Zhaba Aba. She angrily said to the bandits: "I won't say anything even if you beat me to death." On the night before the bandits were about to kill her, she broke free from her ropes while the bandits were drunk and escaped from the house where she was held.

    Since then, her body has become weaker, but she still insists on working. After the democratic reforms, she actively led the masses in establishing agricultural cooperatives.

    For the Construction of the Hometown
    Gongga Dangqin from Ganzi County chose to learn technology. Now, this child who used to herd cattle has become an excellent Tibetan water conservancy technician.

    In 1951, Gongga Dangqin left his hometown and went to the training class of the former Xikang Provincial Water Conservancy Department to study. It was almost unimaginable to learn technology without culture, but Gongga Dangqin resolutely chose this path. He first concentrated on learning the necessary mathematics. He seized every spare moment to read textbooks and do exercises, every day until late at night. He started with the addition and subtraction of elementary school and insisted on doing every problem; sometimes, a difficult problem took two or three days, but he never felt discouraged or wavered. In this way, he spent half a year learning the arithmetic textbooks of six years of elementary school, learned to use the abacus, and then began to learn junior high school algebra. He went from being a translator to a real water conservancy technician.

    In the areas where he has worked, there are many stories about his hard work. In order to find the simplest canal route, he used ropes to hang on cliffs to carry out measurements, and sometimes he and the masses looked for water sources, running in the mountains for several days in a row, eating tsampa when he was hungry, and sleeping in caves at night. Last year, he was selected to attend the prefecture's advanced producer representative meeting.

    In today's Ganzi Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, examples like Angwang Cilie, Zhaba Aba, and Gongga Dangqin are almost impossible to list one by one. They are the leaders of all ethnic groups in the autonomous prefecture in building a socialist paradise. Their growth has made us see the rebirth of a nation, the future of a nation!

    藏族人民的好儿女
    本报记者　于竞祁
  1950年冬天，甘孜藏族自治州正式诞生。从此，这块辽阔高原上的藏族人民，在中国共产党的领导下历史上第一次得到了当家作主的权利。几年来，广大藏族人民在党的教育培养以及在推翻农奴主统治的斗争，在生产建设的实际工作锻炼中，干部的队伍迅速地成长起来。他们都是藏族人民的好儿女。
    永远和群众在一起
    道孚县的昂旺次列就是他们中的一个。当人民解放军第一次来到高原上的时候，昂旺次列还是一个受尽苦难的贫苦农民。他在支援进军当民工的过程中，深深为人民战士关怀和爱护藏族人民的作风所感动。从此，他积极接受党的教育。1953年，他首先带头响应人民政府号召，改进技术，发展生产，在全县第一个试种了比当地小麦产量高得多的南大（正）小麦良种，第一个使用新式步犁，推动了许多农民采用良种和使用新式农具。当年，他就被选为省的劳动模范。这以后，他一直担任省人民代表。
    昂旺次列为了团结藏族同胞求得解放，当民主改革一开始，他就整夜地到从前和自己一块受苦的伙伴家里谈心，倾诉过去的痛苦，宣传党的政策。当时，他被选为农协会主席。封建主们有的威胁他，说要暗杀他，有的企图收买他，他丝毫没有动摇。因此，民主改革后又被群众选为副县长。
    几年来，昂旺次列始终保持着优良的品质。他经常下乡去工作。到了地里拿起犁头就和大家一块劳动，休息时和他们谈心，了解各种情况，征求群众意见，耐心宣传党的政策。在去年，并领导群众战胜了三十年来所未有的旱灾。
    像岩石一样的坚强
    1956年，当自治州开始民主改革以后，在西藏反动上层的策动下，一些极端反动的封建主们发动了叛乱。他们用尽狠毒的手段对付积极拥护改革的藏族干部和群众。折多山深处普沙绒乡藏族女副乡长扎波阿巴，她过去是一个饱受封建主鞭打的放羊娃。民主改革中，她积极向工作组反映情况，检举他们隐瞒财产的罪恶，因而受到封建主们切齿的痛恨。反动的封建主木吉阿中组织叛乱时，突然地袭击住在扎波阿巴家的工作组，抓住了扎波阿巴。匪徒们用木棒、枪托打得她遍体鳞伤。木吉阿中逼着她交出住在另一家的一个工作干部。但他们没有能从扎波阿巴口中得到一点东西。她愤怒地向匪徒们说：“打死我也不说。”就在匪徒们要杀害她的头一天晚上，他趁匪徒们喝醉酒的时候挣脱了绳索，逃出了关着她的屋子。
    这以后，她的身体更瘦弱了，但她仍然坚持工作。民主改革后，她积极领导群众建立农业社。
    为了建设家乡
    甘孜县的贡呷当钦选择了学技术。现在，这个从前放牛的孩子，已成为一个出色的藏族水利技术员了。
    1951年，贡呷当钦离开了家乡，到了原西康省水利厅的训练班去学习。没有文化学技术，这几乎是不敢想像的事，然而，贡呷当钦却坚定不移地选择了这条道路。他首先把精力集中在学好必需的数学上。他抓住了每一个空隙时间看课本，做习题，每天直到深夜。他从小学的加减法开始，坚持每题必做；有时，一个难题做上两三天，也毫不灰心和动摇。就这样，他用半年时间，学完了小学六年的算术课本，学会了打算盘，接着，又开始学初中代数。他从当翻译而成了一个真正的水利技术员。
    在他工作过的地区，流传着许多关于他的艰苦工作的事迹。为了寻找最简捷的水渠路线，他曾用绳子吊在悬岩上进行测量，有时和群众一道找水源，接连几天在大山里奔跑，饿了吃点糌粑，晚上睡在岩洞里。去年，他被选出席了全州的先进生产者代表会。
    在今天的甘孜藏族自治州里，像昂旺次列、扎波阿巴和贡呷当钦这样的事例，几乎是无法一一列举的。他们是全自治州各族人民建设社会主义乐园的带头人。他们的成长，使我们看到了一个民族的新生，一个民族的未来！（附图片）
