Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, May 1st: Over 30,000 people in Lhasa held a massive demonstration and rally today to celebrate International Labor Day ("May Day"), celebrate the great victory in suppressing the rebellion in the Shannan region, and resolutely oppose imperialists and Indian expansionists for plotting the Tibetan rebellion and interfering in our country's internal affairs.

The marching队伍passed through Barkhor Street in five routes. The streets were filled with the sound of gongs and drums, cheers, and thunderous slogans that shook the whole city. Every residential committee organized large song and dance troupes and bands. Thousands of young men and women, holding snow-white hadas, sang newly composed songs praising Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, praising the new life, and played national musical instruments such as sheepskin drums, six-stringed guitars, long horns, and flutes, dancing the most solemn "Tashi Sholpa" dance. Folk artists performed yak dances and Tibetan operas in the marching队伍, and the entire marching队伍was filled with joy.

The various new things that appeared in the marching队伍were very touching. In front of the marching队伍of residents in the Chengnan District, sixteen Tibetan veteran painters carried huge portraits of Mao Zedong, Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai, and Zhu De painted by them. These Tibetan veteran painters had been painting Buddha statues, murals, and window decorations for temples and aristocratic residences for decades. Tibetan workers held up real objects or models of iron hammers, hoes, and plows they made themselves. Farmers, beggars, and disabled people who had suffered cruel persecution under the darkest serf system marched happily through the streets of Lhasa.

More than 1,600 suburban farmers and workers came to the streets of Lhasa amid cheers. After the establishment of the Lhasa Military Control Commission, it has distributed more than 259,000 jin of interest-free seed grain to suburban farmers and helped them sow the first batch of highland barley seeds. The farmers brought beef and highland barley wine, and they planned to have fun in Lhasa until dark today.

Lamaseries from Drepung Monastery, Sera Monastery, and the large and small Jokhang Temples in Lhasa also participated in today's parade and rally to congratulate the working people of Tibet on the festival and express their indignation against imperialism and foreign reactionaries for interfering in our country's internal affairs. Lamas blew Buddhist horns and conch shells, and also performed unicorn dances and phoenix dances.

At 12 noon, the marching队伍gathered in People's Square in front of the Potala Palace for a celebration meeting.

Tan Guansan, Deputy Secretary of the Tibet Working Committee of the Communist Party of China and Political Commissar of the Tibet Military Region, spoke at the meeting. In his speech, he severely condemned the crimes of British imperialism and Indian expansionists in plotting the Tibetan rebellion and interfering in our country's internal affairs. He said that we must resolutely and thoroughly quell the rebellion and completely eliminate the bandits; we must resolutely realize national regional autonomy and fully realize the rights of the working people and patriotic progressive people to be masters in managing their own national internal affairs. He finally pointed out that we must gradually implement democratic reforms, oppose all destructive activities that undermine reforms and attempt to maintain the serf system forever, and strive to build a democratic and socialist new Tibet.

Lamin Yexisutuo, Deputy Secretary-General of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, congratulated the working people of the city with "Tashi Delek" (good luck) at the meeting. He said: "Since the armed rebellion in the Lhasa area was quelled, imperialists and Indian expansionists have been continuously slandering and attacking our country. I want to warn those foreign ambitionists: 650 million Chinese people, including the Tibetan people, have stood up, and the era of being slaughtered and insulted is over. "No foreign reactionary can separate Tibet from China, nor can they prevent the Tibetan people from taking the road of democracy and socialism."

Jiangba, a representative of Tibetan workers, took the stage and angrily denounced the crimes of the former Tibetan local government and the upper-class reactionary group for cruelly oppressing and despising workers. He firmly said: "Tibet is the Tibet of our workers and all the people. We, the Tibetan people, and the people of all ethnic groups in the motherland are dear brothers. We support the Communist Party, we want socialism, and we resolutely don't want the cannibalistic and blood-drinking serf society that oppresses our working people. Now, imperialists and Indian expansionists are still shamelessly slandering our country and interfering in our internal affairs. We, the Tibetan people, resolutely oppose it!"

The meeting passed a letter of慰问to the People's Liberation Army stationed in Tibet. Finally, the whole audience shouted slogans such as: "Celebrate the great victory of suppressing the rebellion in Shannan!" "Resolutely oppose imperialism and foreign reactionaries interfering in our internal affairs! The Tibetan people unite and strive to build a democratic and socialist new Tibet!"

    拉萨三万多人“五一”示威游行
    庆祝山南地区平叛的伟大胜利
    怒斥外国干涉者策动西藏叛乱
    据新华社拉萨1日电　拉萨市今天有三万多人举行了声势浩大的示威游行和集会，庆祝“五一”国际劳动节，庆祝山南地区平叛的伟大胜利，并且坚决反对帝国主义和印度扩张主义分子策动西藏叛乱、干涉我国内政。
    游行队伍成五路通过八角街，街上锣鼓喧天，欢声雷动，宏亮的口号声震撼着全城。每一个居民委员会都组织了人数众多的歌舞队和乐队，上千名男女青年拿着雪白的哈达，唱着新编写的歌颂毛主席和共产党、歌颂新生活的歌曲，吹奏着羊蹄鼓、六弦琴、长号、笛子等民族乐器，跳着最隆重的“扎西雪巴”舞。民间艺人在游行行列中表演着牦牛舞和藏戏，整个游行队伍一片喜气洋洋。
    游行队伍中出现的各种新鲜事物令人十分感动。在城南区居民游行大队的前面，十六名藏族老画工抬着他们画的毛泽东、刘少奇、周恩来、朱德的巨幅画像，这些藏族老画工在过去的几十年里一直是为寺庙和贵族宅第画佛像、壁画和窗花的。藏族工人高举着他们自己制造的铁锤、锄头和犁刀的实物或模型。在最黑暗的农奴制度下受尽了残酷迫害的农奴、乞丐和残废者欢呼着走过拉萨大街。
    一千六百多名郊区农民和工人在欢呼声中来到拉萨街头。拉萨市军管会成立后已给郊区农民发放了二十五万九千多斤无息种粮，并帮助他们播下了第一批青稞种。农民们带着牛肉和青稞酒，他们今天要在拉萨玩到天黑。
    哲蚌寺、色拉寺和拉萨城内大、小昭寺的喇嘛们也参加了今天的游行和集会，向西藏劳动人民贺节，并表示他们反对帝国主义和外国反动派干涉我国内政的愤慨心情。喇嘛们吹着佛号和海螺，还表演了麒麟舞和凤凰舞。
    中午十二时，游行队伍齐集在布达拉宫前面的人民广场，举行庆祝大会。
  中共西藏工委副书记、西藏军区政治委员谭冠三在大会上讲了话。他在讲话中严厉地谴责了英帝国主义和印度扩张主义分子策动西藏叛乱、干涉我国内政的罪行。他说，我们要坚决彻底地平息叛乱，干干净净地肃清叛匪；要坚决实现民族区域自治，充分实现劳动人民和爱国进步人士在管理本民族内部事务上当家作主的权利。他最后指出，我们要逐步地实行民主改革，反对一切破坏改革、妄图永远保持农奴制度的破坏活动，为建设民主和社会主义的新西藏而奋斗。
    西藏自治区筹备委员会副秘书长拉敏·益喜楚臣在大会上向全市劳动人民祝贺“扎西德勒”（吉祥如意）。他说：“自从拉萨地区武装叛乱平息以来，帝国主义和印度扩张主义分子就连篇累牍地向我国进行诬蔑和攻击。我要警告那些外国野心家们：包括西藏人民在内的六亿五千万中国人民已经站起来了，任人宰割和侮辱的时代永远结束了。“任何外国反动派都不能把西藏从中国分裂出去，都不能阻止西藏人民走民主和社会主义的道路。”
    藏族工人代表江巴走上讲台，他愤怒地控诉了原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团残酷压迫和贱视工人的罪行。他坚决地说：“西藏是我们工人和全体人民的西藏，我们西藏人民和祖国各民族人民是亲兄弟。我们拥护共产党，我们要社会主义，坚决不要压迫我们劳动人民的那种吃人肉、喝人血的农奴社会。现在，帝国主义和印度扩张主义分子还在那里无耻地诬蔑我们国家，干涉我国内政，我们西藏人民坚决反对！”
    大会通过了致驻藏人民解放军的慰问信。最后，全场一致高呼：“庆祝山南平叛的伟大胜利！”“坚决反对帝国主义和外国反动派干涉我国内政！西藏人民团结起来，为建设民主和社会主义的新西藏而奋斗！”等口号。
