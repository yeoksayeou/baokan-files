Xinhua News Agency, Phnom Penh, May 20th: According to the Vietnamese-language "Neutral Newspaper" published here, the abbot of a Vietnamese temple called Longguan Temple (transliteration) in Phnom Penh refused to distribute an issue of a "press release" for the South Vietnamese "delegation" in Cambodia, because this "press release" contained a vicious article attacking the Chinese government's suppression of the Tibetan rebellion.

The newspaper said that many copies of this "press release" were sent to the temple in an attempt to distribute them among the Vietnamese in Cambodia through the abbot of the temple. However, when the abbot learned the content of this "press release," he refused to accept them and immediately returned them. He also said that as a monk, he did not want to work for "psychological warfare." The newspaper said that the abbot's actions were admired by his followers.

    金边一住持拒绝散发攻击中国的宣传品
    新华社金边20日电　据这里出版的越南文“中立报”报道，在金边的一座叫龙关庙（译音）的越南庙宇的住持，拒绝为南越驻柬埔寨的“代表团”散发一期“新闻公报”，因为在这期“公报”中，刊登了一篇攻击中国政府平息西藏叛乱的恶毒的文章。
    这家报纸说，这一期“公报”有许多份数被送交这座庙宇，企图通过庙宇的住持在柬埔寨的越南人中散发。但是，当住持知道这一期“公报”的内容以后，就拒绝接受它们，并且立即把它们退回。他并且说，作为一个僧侣，他不愿为“心理战”工作。这家报纸说，住持的行动得到了他的教徒的敬佩。
