Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, 9th - This correspondent, Wan Guang, reports: The venue for the Geneva Foreign Ministers Conference and the "Press House" building are busily undergoing final preparations, as the conference of Eastern and Western countries is about to open on the 11th. Heads of delegations from the countries concerned are arriving today and tomorrow. Thousands of journalists from around the world have gathered here one after another.

This is a new East-West Foreign Ministers Conference since the summit meeting and foreign ministers meeting of the Soviet Union, the United States, Britain, and France in 1955. Journalists who covered the conference in Geneva that year will not forget how rampant the forces in the United States and other Western countries were in stubbornly obstructing the relaxation of the situation, so that the conference failed to reach an agreement on issues such as Germany. The "cold war" plotters openly put forward the slogan at the time: "Bury" the "Geneva spirit" of peaceful consultation to resolve international disputes, and "throw East-West consultation into the dustbin of history." However, now U.S. Secretary of State Herter, West German Foreign Minister Brentano, and others have had to come to Geneva again.

Since the previous East-West Foreign Ministers Conference, the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic have consistently worked to strive for a peaceful solution to the German question and to ensure European security. Since last November, the Soviet Union, in response to the key issues that urgently need to be resolved, has also put forward proposals for concluding a peace treaty with Germany and ending the occupation regime in West Berlin. As soon as these proposals were put forward, the Western ruling groups fell into a very embarrassing and passive state. At the beginning, the rulers of the United States, West Germany, and other countries loudly clamored that they "can only say 'no' to Soviet proposals" and that "negotiating with the Soviet Union is harmful and useless." However, the Soviet proposals are so popular among the European and world public that the "defense line" of not sitting at the negotiating table built by the cold war propagandists quickly became untenable.

The Geneva East-West Conference provides a favorable opportunity to promote the resolution of ripe international issues. The people of all countries have every reason to demand that this foreign ministers conference and the subsequent summit meeting will help resolve these international issues, first of all, the issue of a peace treaty with Germany and the ending of the occupation regime in West Berlin, thereby opening the way to ease international tensions.

People also naturally see that although the United States and its followers have been forced to sit at the Geneva negotiating table, the West is clamoring to put forward a so-called "package plan" at the foreign ministers conference. This means that they want to use the issue of German reunification, which can only be resolved by the Germans themselves, to obstruct the resolution of the most pressing current issues of concluding a peace treaty with Germany and the West Berlin issue. This plan is mainly drafted based on the opinions of the United States and West Germany. The name "package" means that no issues such as Germany and European security can actually be resolved. On the eve of the Geneva conference, the United States is also trying its best to poison the international atmosphere, accelerate the pace of West German atomic armament, step up the establishment of missile bases in Western Europe, and U.S. planes have repeatedly carried out provocative high-altitude flights when entering West Berlin. The official propaganda machines of the United States, West Germany, and other countries are also systematically spreading pessimistic air about the results of the foreign ministers conference in advance. All of these cannot but cast a political cloud in the clear weather of Geneva.

However, in the face of the urgent demands of the people of the world for easing international tensions, the Western ruling groups are in a serious diplomatic predicament. If the West, relying on Dulles' "carrot and stick" policy, still maintained a so-called "consolidated common front" at the 1955 Geneva Conference, this "front" is now riddled with holes. Although Western countries have held bilateral or multilateral talks one after another in Washington, London, Paris, and Bonn over the past few months to prepare for responding to Soviet proposals, they have not been able to eliminate the deep divisions between them. The four-nation foreign ministers' Paris conference at the end of last month, which was "to formulate a common Western strategy," boasted in its communique that it had reached "complete agreement," but even bourgeois newspapers in the United States, Britain, and France generally admitted that the Paris conference avoided many issues of Western disagreement. "New York Times" reporter Sulzberger wrote: The "group of Western diplomats" participating in the Geneva conference is "perhaps the weakest and most divided group since the beginning of the Cold War," the "cracks in the attitudes of Western allies are large," and the United States "is losing the leadership position (in the West) that we (Americans) are familiar with." This can be said to be a concise portrayal of the current "common front" of the West. Obviously, it is becoming increasingly difficult for the United States and its followers to sabotage the Geneva conference and obstruct the easing of international tensions.

### 日内瓦外长会议准备工作忙碌  美国要捣乱  困难却不少

    日内瓦外长会议准备工作忙碌
    美国要捣乱  困难却不少
    新华社日内瓦9日电　本社记者万光报道：日内瓦外长会议的会场和“记者之家”大厦正忙碌地进行着最后的准备工作，东西方国家会议即将在11日开幕。有关国家政府代表团团长今天和明天到达。上千名世界各国的新闻记者已陆续汇集到这里。
    这是1955年苏，美，英，法四国政府首脑会议和外长会议以来的新的一次东西方国家外长会议。当年到日内瓦采访过会议的记者都不会忘记，美国和其他西方国家里顽固阻挠局势和缓的势力当时怎样猖狂地进行阻挠，使这个会议在德国等问题上都没有达成协议。“冷战”策动者当时公开提出的口号是：“埋葬掉”和平协商解决国际争端的“日内瓦精神”，“把东西方协商扔进历史垃圾箱里去。”但是，现在美国国务卿赫脱、西德外交部长勃伦塔诺等人又不得不来到日内瓦了。
    自前次东西方国家外长会议以来，苏联和德意志民主共和国一贯为争取和平解决德国问题和保障欧洲安全而努力。去年11月以来，苏联针对最迫切需要解决的关键问题，又提出了缔结对德和约和结束西柏林占领制度的建议。这些建议一提出来，西方国家统治集团便陷入十分狼狈和被动应付的状态。美国、西德等国的执政者在开始时，还大肆叫嚷过“只能对苏联建议说‘不’”，“同苏联谈判有害无益”。然而，苏联建议在欧洲和世界公众里是这样深得人心，使得冷战鼓吹者筑起的不坐上会谈桌的“防线”，很快就守不住了。
    日内瓦东西方国家会议，为推动解决成熟了的国际问题提供了有利的机会。各国人民完全有理由要求，这次外长会议以及随后需要举行的政府首脑会议将有助于解决这些国际问题，首先是对德和约和结束西柏林占领制度的问题，这样来给和缓国际紧张局势打开道路。
    人们自然还看到，美国及其追随者虽然被迫坐到日内瓦会议桌旁来，但是西方正在喧嚷要在外长会议上提出所谓“一揽子计划”。这就是说，要用只能由德国人自己解决的德国统一问题来阻挠解决当前最迫切的缔结对德和约和西柏林问题。这个计划主要是根据美国和西德的意见拟订的。“一揽子”其名，使得德国、欧洲安全等问题一个也得不到解决是其实。美国还在日内瓦会议前夕竭力毒化国际气氛，加快西德原子武装的步伐，加紧在西欧设立导弹基地，美国飞机在进入西柏林时一再进行挑衅性的高空飞行。美国、西德等国官方宣传机器还在有计划地预先对外长会议结果散布悲观空气。所有这些，都不能不在日内瓦晴朗的天气中，投下一团政治阴云。
    但是，在全世界人民迫切要求和缓国际紧张局势的面前，西方国家统治集团正处在严重外交困境里。如果说，在1955年日内瓦会议上，靠着杜勒斯的“甜饼和皮鞭”，西方还维持着所谓“巩固的共同阵线”；现在，这条“阵线”已经是千孔百疮了。尽管这几个月来西方国家为了准备应付苏联的建议，走马灯似地在华盛顿、伦敦、巴黎、波恩举行一个又一个双边或多边会谈，但是并没有能够消除它们之间的深刻分歧。上月底“拟订西方共同战略”的四国外长巴黎会议在发表的公报里吹嘘达成了“完全的协议”，然而连美国、英国、法国等资产阶级报纸都普遍承认，巴黎会议回避了不少西方意见分歧的问题。“纽约时报”记者苏兹贝格写道：参加日内瓦会议的“西方外交家班子，也许是从冷战开始以来最弱和最分裂的班子”，西方“盟国态度间的裂痕很大”，而美国“正在丧失我们（美国人）所熟悉的（在西方的）领导地位”。这可以说是对西方目前“共同阵线”的简明写照。显然，美国及其追随者要破坏日内瓦会议，阻挠国际紧张局势的和缓的策划是越来越困难了。
