Heilongjiang Province, the main flax-producing area, has already sown 850,000 mu of flax according to plan, an increase of 270,000 mu over last year. The flax sown earlier is already lush green, some growing to more than half a foot high. Heilongjiang Province has a fifty-year history of planting flax, but the quality of this year's flax sowing exceeds that of any previous year.

    黑龙江种亚麻又多又好
    主要的亚麻产地黑龙江省，已经按计划播种了八十五万亩亚麻，播种面积比去年增加了二十七万亩。播种早的亚麻，已经一片翠绿，有的长到半尺多高了。黑龙江省种植亚麻已有五十年的历史，但今年的亚麻播种质量却超过已往任何一年。
