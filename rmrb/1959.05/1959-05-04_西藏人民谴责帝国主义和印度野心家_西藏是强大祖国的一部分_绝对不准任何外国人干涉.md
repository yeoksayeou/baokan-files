Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa Telegram The Preparatory Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region, various people's organizations in Lhasa, and various residents' committees have held meetings in the past few days to condemn the outrageous words and deeds of imperialists and Indian expansionists who interfere in our internal affairs, support the Tibetan upper-class reactionary group in betraying the motherland, and insult our leaders.

    At a forum held by the Preparatory Committee of the Tibet Autonomous Region, all Tibetan staff members severely condemned imperialists and Indian expansionists for rudely interfering in our internal affairs. Lhamin Yixi Chuchen, Deputy Secretary-General, said: "Indian expansionists have reached an extremely arrogant level in interfering in our internal affairs under various pretexts, which we absolutely cannot tolerate." He asked, "Garmok is a place in India. In recent years, traitors such as Lukangwa and Shagaba, who have fled from Tibet to that place, have colluded with imperialists and Chiang Kai-shek secret agents to carry out traitorous activities that undermine the unification of the motherland and harm the Tibetan people, but they have not been stopped by the Indian side. What is going on?"
    Sampo Tenzin Dondup, a Standing Committee member of the Preparatory Committee, cited many historical facts, such as the conferment of the Dalai Lama and the appointment of senior officials, to illustrate that Tibet has been Chinese territory since ancient times, and that the purpose of imperialism in creating Tibetan independence is to attempt to re-enslave the Tibetan people. He pointed out that after British imperialism invaded Lhasa in 1904, the 750,000 pounds of compensation that Tibet was forced to pay to Britain was also paid by the then central government in Beijing. He also expressed his warm support for the resolution on the Tibet issue adopted at the First Session of the Second National People's Congress and his determination to implement it conscientiously.
    Members of the Lhasa Patriotic Women's Federation and the Patriotic Youth Federation were indignant at the forum and condemned the Indian expansionists' interference in our internal affairs as a criminal act that undermines the Five Principles and Sino-Indian friendship. Langdun Tsering Wangmo, Deputy Director of the Patriotic Women's Federation, said: Any sweet words and conspiracies cannot deceive the Tibetan people. Imperialists in the past did indeed "sympathize" with the Tibetan people. Imperialist agents who sneaked into Lhasa lived in the homes of upper-class reactionary nobles and sent them weapons, fearing that they would not be fierce enough in oppressing and exploiting the Tibetan people. Awang Dorje, a member of the Lhasa Patriotic Youth Federation, warned imperialists and Indian expansionists to clear their heads, otherwise they will suffer the consequences of their own actions.
    People from all ethnic groups and walks of life in Lhasa held hundreds of forums and residents' group meetings, expressing their great anger at the Indian expansionists' interference in our internal affairs. At a joint forum held by the fifth and sixth residents' committees in the southern urban district, carpenter Wengze, blacksmith Bubu Tsering, and old Tibetan worker Dorje Penda, who specializes in dyeing and weaving clothing for the Dalai Lama, all scrambled to speak, expressing their firm opposition to imperialism and foreign reactionaries interfering in China's internal affairs and interfering in the affairs of the Tibetan people's own home.
Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa Telegram People in various parts of Tibet held angry rallies to severely condemn imperialists and Indian expansionists for supporting the armed rebellion of the Tibetan upper-class reactionaries, interfering in our internal affairs, and outrageously provoking our leaders.

    Shigatse, the second largest city in Tibet, held a mass rally of thousands of people on the 27th. Deren Tseren Banjue, a representative of the Panchen Kanpo Lija Committee, said at the meeting: "We resolutely oppose the open interference and slander of our great motherland and leaders by imperialists and Indian expansionists." He said: "We want to warn these ambitionists that no conspiracy can deceive our united people of all ethnic groups, and no trick can shake our confidence in safeguarding the unification of the motherland and taking the socialist road."
    In the Tagong area in the Yarlung Zangbo River basin in eastern Tibet, Ali in the western plateau, the Yadong River valley at the northern foot of the Himalayas, and the 39 ethnic group grasslands in northern Tibet, in recent days, the vast upper-class people, temple Khenpos (i.e., chief administrators) and lamas, farmers, herdsmen, businessmen, handicraftsmen, and Tibetan cadres have all held rallies. They unanimously warned Indian expansionists: Tibet will always be China's Tibet, and any attempt to split Tibet from the big family of the motherland will be completely bankrupt in the face of the powerful 600 million people! The masses in the Tagong area angrily denounced the Indian expansionists' nonsense that the Tibetan rebellion was a problem between Tibetans and Han people. They said: "The heinous crimes of the rebels in betraying the motherland and harming the people are obvious to all. This violates the interests of the people of the whole country, especially the Tibetan people, and is not a problem between Han and Tibetan people at all." Chieftain Qiangze Yundeng said: "We warn foreign reactionaries: The Tibetan people are part of the big family of the powerful motherland, and the era of being slaughtered at will before liberation is long gone."
    The people in the Yadong River valley who had bravely resisted the British imperialist invasion felt extremely angry about the shameless act of the Mumbai police authorities in India condoning hooligans to insult Chairman Mao, the great leader of all ethnic groups in our country. Qinsha Lobsang Zhuoyou, a representative from the Jinre area of Yadong, said angrily: The vast number of monks and lay people in Jinre are extremely angry about the despicable actions of the Indian expansionists. We resolutely condemn the Indian interventionists.
    Farmers and herdsmen from Suozong, Baqingzong, Bizong, and Sezhazong on the Thirty-Nine Ethnic Group Grassland have held rallies for days to condemn the Indian expansionists' crude interference in our internal affairs. The people of these zong also passed a resolution guaranteeing that they would support the People's Liberation Army with practical actions to completely eliminate the remnants of the bandits as soon as possible.

    西藏人民谴责帝国主义和印度野心家
    西藏是强大祖国的一部分
    绝对不准任何外国人干涉
    据新华社拉萨电　西藏自治区筹备委员会和拉萨市各人民团体以及各个居民委员会，这几天都分别举行集会，谴责帝国主义和印度扩张主义分子干涉我国内政、支持西藏上层反动集团背叛祖国和侮辱我国领导人的猖狂言行。
    在西藏自治区筹备委员会举行的座谈会上，全体藏族工作人员严厉谴责帝国主义和印度扩张主义分子粗暴干涉我国内政。副秘书长拉敏·益喜楚臣说：“印度扩张主义分子用各种借口干涉我国内政，已到了十分狂妄的地步，这是我们绝对不能容忍的。”他问道，“噶伦堡是印度的地方，近几年来，从西藏逃窜到那里的叛国头子鲁康娃、夏格巴等，大肆勾结帝国主义和蒋介石特务分子，猖狂地进行破坏祖国统一、残害西藏人民的叛国活动，而并未受到印度方面的制止，这是怎么回事？”
    筹备委员会常务委员桑颇·才旺仁增引用许多历史事实，如册封达赖喇嘛、任命高级官员等来说明西藏自古以来就是中国的领土，帝国主义制造西藏独立的目的是企图重新奴役西藏人民。他指出，1904年英帝国主义侵入拉萨后，西藏被迫给予英国的赔款七十五万英镑，也是当由时的北京中央政府支付的。他还表示热烈拥护第二届全国人民代表大会第一次会议关于西藏问题的决议并且要认真地贯彻执行。
    拉萨市爱国妇女联谊会和爱国青年联谊会的会员们在座谈会上群情激愤，纷纷谴责印度扩张主义分子干涉我国内政是破坏五项原则和中印友谊的罪恶行为。爱国妇女联谊会副主任朗顿·泽仁旺姆说：任何花言巧语和阴谋诡计都是骗不了西藏人民的。帝国主义过去的确“同情”过西藏人，潜入拉萨的帝国主义特务分子住在上层反动贵族家里，送武器给他们，唯恐他们压迫剥削西藏人民不够凶狠。拉萨市爱国青年联谊会会员阿旺多吉警告帝国主义和印度扩张主义分子要清醒一下头脑，否则将自食其恶果。
    拉萨市各族各界人民举行了上百次座谈会和居民小组会，他们对印度扩张主义分子干涉我国内政表示极大愤怒。在城南区第五、第六两个居民委员会联合举行的座谈会上，木匠翁泽、铁匠卜布侧仁和专门给达赖喇嘛染织衣料的老藏工多吉彭达都争着发言，表示坚决反对帝国主义和外国反动派干涉中国内政、干涉西藏人民自己家中的事。
  新华社拉萨电　西藏各地人民愤怒集会，严厉谴责帝国主义和印度扩张主义分子支持西藏上层反动分子武装叛乱、干涉我国内政、侮辱我国领袖的猖狂挑衅。
    西藏第二大城——日喀则27日举行了千人大会。班禅堪布会议厅委员会的代表德伦·慈仁班觉在会上说：“帝国主义和印度扩张主义分子，对我们伟大祖国和领袖进行公开干涉和污蔑，对此我们表示坚决的反对。”他说：“我们要警告这些野心家们，任何阴谋诡计都蒙骗不了我们团结一致的各族人民，任何伎俩也动摇不了我们维护祖国统一和走社会主义道路的信心。”
    西藏东部雅鲁藏布江流域塔工地区，西部高原的阿里，喜马拉雅山北麓的亚东河谷，和藏北三十九族草原上，近几天来，广大上层人士、寺庙堪布（即总管）和喇嘛、农民、牧民、商人、手工业者和藏族干部，都举行了集会。他们一致警告印度扩张主义分子：西藏永远是中国的西藏，任何企图把西藏从祖国大家庭中分裂出去的阴谋，都将在强大的六亿人民面前彻底破产！塔工地区的群众愤怒地斥责了印度扩张主义分子所谓西藏叛乱是藏人和汉人之间的问题的胡说，他们说：“叛乱分子背叛祖国、残害人民的滔天罪行，有目共睹，这是违反全国人民首先是藏族人民的利益，根本不是汉人和藏人之间的什么问题。”头人强则云登说：“我们警告外国反动分子：西藏人民是强大祖国大家庭中的一部分，解放前那种任人宰割的时代早已过去了。”
    亚东河谷曾经英勇抗击英帝国主义侵略的人民，对印度孟买警察当局纵容流氓侮辱我国各族人民伟大领袖毛主席的无耻行径感到无比愤怒。亚东金热地区的代表钦沙·洛桑卓尤愤怒地说：金热的广大僧俗人民对印度扩张主义分子的这种卑鄙行径万分气愤，我们坚决谴责印度干涉者。
    三十九族草原上的索宗、巴庆宗、比如宗、色扎宗的农、牧民们连日举行大会，谴责印度扩张主义分子对我国内政的粗暴干涉。这些宗的人们还通过了一项决议，保证要以实际行动，支援人民解放军早日彻底消灭叛匪残余。
