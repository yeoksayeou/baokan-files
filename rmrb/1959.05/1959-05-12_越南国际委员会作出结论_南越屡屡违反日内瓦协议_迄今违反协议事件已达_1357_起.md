Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, 11th: According to local newspapers, the Vietnam International Commission wrote to the Liaison Delegation of the General Command of the Vietnam People's Army on April 22nd, stating that the International Commission had concluded on another sixty-four incidents of violations of the Geneva Accords by the South Vietnamese authorities, which the People's Army had protested against. The International Commission deemed that the South Vietnamese authorities had violated Article 25 of the "Agreement on the Cessation of Hostilities in Vietnam" of the 1954 Geneva Conference. Thus, to date, the International Commission has concluded that the South Vietnamese authorities have violated the aforementioned provisions of the Geneva Accords in one thousand three hundred and fifty-seven incidents.

The letter pointed out that when the International Commission investigated incidents of persecution and murder of former resistance personnel in South Vietnam by the South Vietnamese authorities, based on protests raised by the Liaison Delegation of the General Command of the Vietnam People's Army, the South Vietnamese authorities "did not provide the International Commission with full assistance and cooperation in accordance with Article 25 of the Geneva Accords."
