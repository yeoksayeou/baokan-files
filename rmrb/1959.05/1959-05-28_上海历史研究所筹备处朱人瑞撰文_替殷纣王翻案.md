Zhu Renrui of the Shanghai History Research Institute Preparatory Office Writes
"Rehabilitating King Zhou of Yin"

Zhu Renrui of the Shanghai History Research Institute Preparatory Office has recently written a long article of more than 20,000 characters entitled: "Rehabilitating King Zhou of Yin". He basically adopts the method of using negative materials, and after comparison, analysis, and research, puts forward his new argument, namely, that King Zhou of Yin was by no means the so-called licentious and tyrannical "tyrant," but a person of extraordinary talent and bravery, who made great contributions to the social and cultural development of the Chinese nation and the people of that time. He made a comprehensive and unreserved affirmation of King Zhou of Yin. This article was serialized in the Shanghai Jiefang Daily on May 8, 12, and 13, with some deletions during serialization. We now introduce its arguments based on the original text for readers' reference.

The so-called crimes of King Zhou of Yin are either lies and slanders, or turning good deeds into bad ones.

The author says that Cao Cao's notoriety is far-reaching, even more so than King Zhou of Yin, the only difference being that Cao Cao was a founding emperor, leaving behind immortal achievements and outstanding poems, his flaws not overshadowing his merits, making it impossible for orthodox theorists to completely blind the eyes of the world. King Zhou of Yin was a monarch of a fallen state, and since the Zhou Dynasty, ancient documents mentioning him have been uniformly negative, without a single word of praise. The historical books list his licentiousness and tyranny as truly shocking. But strangely enough, the six major charges previously leveled against him are nothing more than exaggerations of the crimes of Xia Jie. And they were all propaganda and destruction of the "former king" Zhou by the "rising" Zhou people. He quoted Xia Zengyou, the author of "A History of Ancient China," as saying that there are people in the world who learn to do good things in the same way, but no one learns to do bad things in the same way, there must be fabrications and embellishments here. Then the author analyzes the six charges listed in the "Book of Documents." The author believes that saying King Zhou of Yin "indulged in alcohol" is simply because the Yin people originally liked alcohol, and King Zhou may have had a particularly large capacity for alcohol and drank particularly good wine. As for "drunkenness and confusion," it would definitely not be the case. How could a muddle-headed person become an invincible warrior who "attacked a hundred times and never failed"? As for the "ponds of wine and forests of meat" and other bizarre tales, they all arose from this. And "not using nobles and old ministers" was actually because a group of older people who originally had power, led by King Zhou's brother, Wei Zi Qi, opposed King Zhou after he ascended the throne, did not hold important positions, and were dissatisfied, putting it on King Zhou's head, which was used by the Zhou people for propaganda. Furthermore, "employing petty people" is actually an indiscriminate accusation. It is true that King Zhou promoted slaves to the position of doctor and minister in the late Yin Dynasty, but this should be a progressive measure, and his extremely prosperous military achievements, his immortal contributions to national development and cultural development, are inseparable from this measure. Moreover, Tang and Wu Ding, who preceded him in their extremely prosperous military achievements, also took measures to promote people regardless of their background. As for "listening to women's words," it is just rumors from the opposition and the Zhou people's surprise. The author said that capable women in the Yin Dynasty were very active, and many women appeared in the oracle bone inscriptions. For example, Wu Ding's concubine, Fu Hao, could lead thousands of people to fight enemies, and even Wu Ding's famous general Zhi was under her control. Why couldn't such women's words be listened to? However, this is something that the backward Zhou people could not imagine. King Zhou's wife may have been a character like Fu Hao. But because she was King Zhou's wife, she was even more hated by the opposition and attacked by the Zhou people. Even stranger is that the fifth charge said that King Zhou "believed in destiny," while the sixth charge said that he "did not pay attention to sacrifices." In fact, it is against history to say that the Yin people did not believe in heaven, and it is even more fabricated to say that King Zhou of Yin did not worship his ancestors. According to unearthed oracle bone inscriptions, the sacrificial ceremonies during the time of Emperor Yi (King Zhou's father) and Emperor Xin (King Zhou) were the most complete in the Yin Dynasty.

Therefore, from the perspective of these so-called crimes, they are either lies and slanders, or turning good deeds into bad ones. The author said that when Cui Dongbi and Gu Jiegang added a charge of "ignorance" to King Zhou, was King Zhou, who had a record of "a hundred victories," really a mediocre person? The Zhou people had repeatedly praised Emperor Yi, even calling him "Wise King of Yin," and Wei Zi was also a very capable person. How can it be understood that Emperor Yi did not establish his capable eldest son, but established an ignorant youngest son?

Wei Zi Qi, who opposed King Zhou of Yin, was the main person responsible for the fall of the Yin Dynasty, and also the main person responsible for spreading rumors and slanders against King Zhou.

Subsequently, the author believes that tracing the reasons for the rise and fall of the Yin Dynasty is an important key issue in evaluating King Zhou of Yin, because King Zhou of Yin became a person to whom "all the evils of the world are attributed" precisely because of the result of "death of the person and destruction of the state," "reversing cause and effect." The author believes that the rise and fall of the Yin Dynasty was first because a major split broke out within the Yin royal family. The author said that according to Zuo Zhuan's Commentary on the Ninth Year of Duke Ai, Lu Shi Chunqiu, and Zheng Xuan's explanation, Wei Zi Qi was the eldest son of Emperor Yi. The Yin people followed the system of "brother succeeding brother," but Emperor Yi passed the throne to King Zhou instead of Wei Zi Qi. Wei Zi was not established and naturally was not reconciled. After King Zhou ascended the throne, two factions formed. Wei Zi's faction opposed King Zhou, and many things arose from this. Wei Zi Qi harbored resentment against King Zhou because he could not succeed to the throne, and deliberately spread rumors and slanders against King Zhou. This can be proven from the fact that almost all of the six major crimes of King Zhou listed by the Zhou people originated from the Yin people. The opposition and the enemy sang in harmony, like the drum responding to the drumstick. Comparing these materials, it is undoubtedly clear that there were spokespersons for the enemy country hidden in the Yin Dynasty. King Zhou of Yin, because he used a group of capable people, his regime was very consolidated, and he often went on southern and northern expeditions, simply tolerating these rumors. Until the campaign against the Eastern Yi, because the war lasted a long time and the Yin people suffered heavy casualties, the opposition faction inside began to stir. After King Zhou returned victorious, he learned about these situations, and the struggle between the two factions intensified. The author said that assassinations then occurred, such as the opposition faction "Shang Rong once held feathers and flutes and relied on cavalry and infantry to attack King Zhou," but failed and fled to the Taihang Mountains. Bi Gan clashed with King Zhou and was killed by King Zhou. Ji Zi was imprisoned by King Zhou. Wei Zi hid himself, and Wei Zi's confidants, Grand Master Ci and Little Master Jiang, defected to King Wu of Zhou, leaking the inside information of the Yin people. The great conspirator King Wu of Zhou then took advantage of this opportunity to announce to all the tribes to immediately send troops to attack King Zhou. King Zhou of Yin, under the circumstances that it was difficult to recruit new soldiers after just returning from the war, the standing army was limited and had not yet recovered from fatigue, and the internal situation was unstable, was suddenly attacked by the powerful Zhou allied forces. It was originally difficult to win, but unexpectedly encountered captured soldiers turning against him on the battlefield, and the collapse of "wavering elements," and finally died fighting bravely in the epoch-making Battle of Muye. Therefore, the author believes that Wei Zi Qi was the one who spread rumors and slanders against King Zhou, Wei Zi Qi was the one who launched the internal strife, Wei Zi Qi was the one who sent people to defect to the enemy, and Wei Zi Qi was the one who invited foreign aggression. The responsibility for the fall of the Yin Dynasty should mainly be borne by Wei Zi Qi.

The five great achievements and four major advantages of King Zhou of Yin

The author believes that King Zhou of Yin had five great achievements for the people of that time and the Chinese nation in history; and in connection with these achievements, he personally had four major advantages. His achievements are: First, opening up the Southeast and developing the nation. The author said that King Zhou's pacification of the Eastern Yi played a major role in the preservation and development of the Yin nation. The subsequent retreat of the Yin people from the Central Plains and their southward migration was a failure for the Yin nation, but from the perspective of the entire development of the Chinese nation, opening up the Southeast had great significance. This is King Zhou's immortal contribution to national development. Second, carrying forward and developing traditional culture. The author believes that from the negative materials, at least these three things can be affirmed: the architecture during King Zhou's time surpassed previous generations, King Zhou invented and promoted crafts, and King Zhou promoted and created music. Third, spreading culture to the backward southeastern region. The author said that many ancient artifacts from the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods have been passed down in the southern states of Xu, Chu, Wu, and Yue. The inscriptions on the artifacts are mostly four characters per sentence, which is roughly similar to the inscriptions on the ancient artifacts passed down in the northern states. This shows the general situation of southern culture, especially the emergence of Chu Ci literature in the Warring States period, which added splendor to the South. Needless to say, this is inseparable from the southward migration of Yin culture. Fourth, employing people based on talent. The author said that the Zhou people attacked King Zhou for "employing petty people," but King Zhou was able to promote a large number of new people to govern at once in a situation where the court was full of old people, which was a reform measure aimed at decline. These people put forward many progressive suggestions for the civil and military affairs of the time. Moreover, because King Zhou went from employing people based on talent to "distancing incompetent people," and further to "talented people being happy to be used," it played a positive role in the development of the Yin Dynasty in politics, economy, and military affairs. Fifth, valuing prisoners of war. The author said that using prisoners of war as soldiers and giving them weapons was a great event at that time. In the wars of tribal societies, there was only mutual killing, and prisoners of war were not needed at all. In the wars of slave societies, prisoners of war were the objects of the war, but there was no talk of valuing them. The author also said: According to the records in the oracle bone inscriptions, before Emperor Yi and Emperor Xin (especially during the time of Wu Ding), the number of prisoners of war used as sacrificial sacrifices was very large. During the time of Emperor Yi and Emperor Xin, the number of people killed for sacrifices was generally only within ten people. Comparing this with the use of prisoners of war as soldiers, there is no doubt that King Zhou valued prisoners of war. As for King Zhou's own advantages, the author believes: One is "wisdom and courage." This can be proven from the descriptions in the Yin Benji: "Emperor Zhou was quick-witted, quick-thinking, and quick-sighted. He was extremely intelligent and capable, able to fight fierce beasts with his bare hands, wise enough to reject advice, and eloquent enough to disguise his faults. He looked down on his ministers for their abilities and boasted of his reputation, thinking that everyone was below him." Second, "knowing people well." The author believes that this is a prerequisite for "employing people based on talent." Third, "paying attention to integrity." The author said that in an extremely unfavorable situation, when the general trend was gone, King Zhou of Yin was able to resolutely give up his life, and this spirit of heroic sacrifice is enough to prove it. Fourth, the army and the people trusted him. How can this be seen? The author said that the record of "a hundred victories" is impossible without the support of the army. From the scene of "blood flowing and floating pestles," it can also be proven that King Zhou's main force was of one mind. Furthermore, after the Zhou people conquered Yin, a strange phenomenon occurred, that is, the Zhou people did not establish Wei Zi Qi to succeed Yin, but instead established Wu Geng Lufu (King Zhou's son) to govern the Yin people. What power forced the Zhou people to do this? A reasonable explanation is that the Zhou people knew that the Yin people trusted King Zhou, and only by establishing Wu Geng could the situation be stabilized.

Finally, the author said that under malicious propaganda, the correct facts have of course been submerged a lot, but judging only from the above, King Zhou of Yin has contributed to the people of that time, and has contributed to the development of the nation and the development of culture is already very clear. Getting rid of the prejudice of "judging people by success or failure," among the monarchs of slave-owning society, in terms of his contributions to the people and to history, King Zhou should be ranked at the forefront. His position is higher than the previous Wu Ding and the later King Wu of Zhou. "We should rehabilitate King Zhou of Yin, who has been wrongly accused as a negative teacher for three thousand years."

    上海历史研究所筹备处朱人瑞撰文
    “替殷纣王翻案”
    中国科学院上海历史研究所筹备处朱人瑞，最近撰写了一篇长达二万余字的文章，题目是：“替殷纣王翻案”。他基本上采取利用反面材料，经过比照、分析、研究，提出了他的新论点，即认为殷纣王决不是所谓荒淫暴虐的“一夫纣”，而是一个才智过人、英勇异常，对中华民族社会、文化发展和当时人民有巨大贡献的人物。他对殷纣王作了全面的无保留的肯定。这篇文章，已于5月8、12、13日在上海解放日报连载，在连载时曾略有删节。我们现在根据原文，将其论点简介于下，以供读者参考。
    所谓殷纣王的罪恶，不是诓言和诬蔑就是把好事说成坏事
    作者说，曹操的恶名之远扬，比起殷纣王来，简直是望尘莫及，所不同者，曹操是开国之主，留下了不朽的事迹，卓越的诗篇，瑕不掩瑜，正统论者无法一手掩尽天下人耳目。殷纣王则是亡国之君，自周以来，古代文献中提到他的，都是清一色的否定，从没有片言只语的赞扬。史书列举他的荒淫暴虐也真是骇人听闻。但是很奇怪的是，以前加之于他的六大罪状，无非是夏桀的罪状的夸大。而且都是“兴者”周人，对“前王”纣的宣传破坏。他称引“中国古代史”作者夏曾佑的话说，天下有学做好事而一样的，没有学做坏事一样的，这里一定有穿凿附会处。接着作者就对“尚书”中列举的那六条罪状加以分析。作者认为，说殷纣王“酗酒”，无非是因为殷人本来好酒，而纣王可能酒量特别大些，喝的酒特别好些，至于“酗酒迷乱”，决不会是事实。你想一个头脑糊涂的人怎么能成为“百克而卒无后”的战无不胜者呢？至于“酒池肉林”等奇谈，都是从此而生的。而“不用贵戚旧臣”，实际上是以纣王之兄微子启为首的一部分年长的、原来有权力的人，在纣王即位后和纣王对立，没有握重权，心怀不满，把它加在纣王头上，被周人利用来宣传的。再说“登用小人”，实际上是滥加罪名。殷代末年，破格用人，提升奴隶为大夫卿士的确是纣，但这应该是进步的措施，他的极盛的武功，他对民族发展、文化发展的不朽功劳，和这个措施是分不开的。而且早于他的武功极盛的汤和武丁，也都一样采取过破格用人的措施。至于“听信妇言”，更只是反对派的造谣和周人的少见多怪。作者说，殷代有能力的女性是很活跃的，卜辞中出现的女性就很多。例如武丁的妃妾妇好，能带领万千人去打敌人，连武丁的震代名将沚?都受她节制。这样的妇言为什么不能听？可是，这是落后的周民族所想像不到的。纣王妇，可能是和妇好一样的人物。但因为她是纣王的妻子，所以更为反对派所痛恨、周人所攻击。更奇怪的是，第五条罪状说纣王“信有命在天”，而第六条罪状又说他“不留心祭祀”。其实，要殷代人不信天是违反历史的，而说殷纣王不祀先祖更是捏造。据出土的卜辞证明，帝乙（纣父）、帝辛（纣）时的祀典在殷代是最为完备的。
    因此，从上述这些所谓罪状来看，不是诳言和诬蔑，就是把原是好事说成了坏事。作者说到崔东壁、顾颉刚给纣王又加了一条“愚昧”之罪时说，有过“百克”战绩的纣王可能是个真正的庸人吗？周人曾经多次称赞过帝乙，甚至称他为“殷哲王”，而微子又是个很有能力的人。帝乙不立有能力的长子，而立一个愚昧的幼子，这怎么能理解呢？
    反对殷纣王的微子启是殷亡的主要负责者，也是对纣王造谣中伤的主要负责者
    随后，作者认为追寻殷王朝复灭的原因，是评价殷纣王的重要关键问题，因为殷纣王之成为“天下之恶皆归”的人，也正是由于“身死国灭”，“倒果为因”的结果。作者认为，殷王朝的复灭，首先是因为殷王族内部爆发了大分裂。作者说，据左传哀公九年传、吕氏春秋和郑玄的说法，微子启是帝乙的长子，殷人是“兄终弟及”制，但帝乙把王位传给了纣而不传给微子启，微子不得立，自然不甘心。纣即位后，形成了两派。微子一派和纣作对，许多事情都从此而起。微子启因不能继位而对纣怀恨在心，处心积虑地对纣进行造谣中伤，这从周人所举的纣之六大罪状来源几乎全出于殷人可以证明。反对派和敌人，前唱后和，正像桴鼓之相应。把这些材料两相对照，殷王朝里隐藏着敌国的代言人是无疑的了。殷纣王呢，因为用着一批能人，政权很巩固，又常南征北战，对于这些谣言只是容忍着。直到征东夷一役，因为战争时间很长，殷人死伤很大，反对派在内部就蠢蠢欲动了。纣王战胜归来，了解到这些情况后，两派的斗争就尖锐化了。作者说，于是发生了暗杀，如，反对派“商容尝执羽籥冯于马徒，欲以伐纣”，没有成功，逃到太行山去了。比干和纣王冲突，被纣杀了。箕子被纣监禁了。微子隐藏了起来，微子的心腹太师疵和少师畺投奔周武王，把殷人内情泄露了。大阴谋家周武王于是乘此时机遍告各部落马上出兵伐纣。殷纣王在这刚刚复员新兵征集困难、常备军有限且疲劳未复，内部不稳的情况下，突然遭到了强悍的周联军的意外袭击，原是很难取胜的，不料在战场上又遇到俘虏兵倒戈，“动摇分子”的溃散，终于在震古铄今的牧野之战中力战而亡了。因此，作者认为，造谣中伤纣的是微子启，发动内讧的是微子启，派人投敌的是微子启，招引外侮的是微子启，殷亡的责任主要应由微子启来负。
      殷纣王的五大功绩和四大优点
    作者认为，殷纣王在历史上对当时人民和中华民族有过五大功绩；和这些功绩相联系的他个人有四大优点。他的功绩是：第一、开拓东南和发展民族。作者说，纣对东夷的平定，对殷民族的保全和发展起了重大作用。后来的殷人退出中原，向南迁徙，对殷民族来说是失败的，但从整个中华民族发展来说，开拓东南有巨大意义。这是纣王对民族发展的不朽功绩。第二、对传统文化的发扬光大。作者认为，从反面材料来看，至少这三件事可以肯定：纣时建筑是超越前代的，纣对工艺有过发明和提倡，纣对音乐的提倡和创造。第三、对落后的东南区域传播了文化。作者说，春秋战国时代南方徐、楚、吴、越各国传世古器很多，器铭大都四字为句，与北方各国传世古器铭大致相似，可见南方文化的一般情形，特别是战国时代出现了楚词文学，为南方增添了异彩。不消说，这和殷文化的南下是分不开的。第四是用人惟才。作者说，周人曾以“登用小人”攻击纣王，但是纣能够在旧人满朝的情形下，一下提升大量新人执政，却是一种针对衰敝的革新措施。这些人对当时的文治武功提出了不少有进步意义的建议。更由于纣王从用人惟才，转到“不才者远”，更进而“人才乐为之用”，为殷王朝在政治、经济、军事各方面的发展起了良好的作用。第五是重视俘虏。作者说用俘虏当兵，把武器交给他们，这在当时是件了不起的大事。在氏族社会的战争中，只有互相砍杀，根本不要俘虏。在奴隶社会战争中，俘虏虽是目的物，但也谈不上重视。作者又说：再据卜辞所载，乙辛以前（武丁时尤甚）用俘虏作祭祀牺牲的数字很大，到乙辛时杀人以祭的数字一般只在十人以内。以之和用俘虏当兵两相比较，纣王对俘虏的重视，可以无疑了。至于纣本人的优点，作者认为：一是“智勇兼备”。这从殷本纪：“帝纣资辨捷疾，闻见甚敏，材力过人，手格猛兽，知足以距谏，言足以饰非。矜人臣以能，高天下以声，以为皆出己之下”等描述来看，就可证明。二是“明于知人”。作者认为这是“用人惟才”的先决条件。三、“讲究气节”。作者说，在极端不利、大势已去的情况下，殷纣王能毅然决然地付出自己的生命，这种壮烈牺牲的精神，即足以证明。四是军民对他的信服。何以见得？作者说，“百克”的战绩没有军队的支持是不可能的，从“血流漂杵”的局面来看，也可证纣的主力是万众一心的。再如，周人克殷之后，出现过一种奇怪现象，就是周人不立微子启继殷之后，反而立了武庚禄父（纣的儿子）来统辖殷人。甚么力量迫使周人这样做的？合理的解释是因为周人知道殷人信服纣王，只有立武庚才能安定局势。
    最后，作者说，在恶意宣传下，正确的事实当然被湮没不少，但仅从上述而论，殷纣王有功于当时的人民，有功于民族的发展和文化的发展已经非常明白。甩掉“成败论人”的成见，在奴隶占有制社会的君主中，就其对人民对历史的功劳而论，纣应该列在前茅，他的地位，比以前的武丁，以后的周武王还要高些。“应该替这位冤枉当了三千年反面教员的殷纣王翻案。”
