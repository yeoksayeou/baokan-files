Comrades Chairman and Representatives,

I fully support Premier Zhou's "Government Work Report," Vice Premier Li Fuchun's "Report on the Draft National Economic Plan for 1959," Vice Premier Li Xiannian's "Report on the 1958 National Financial Statement and the Draft National Budget for 1959," and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen's "Work Report of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress."

I would now like to express some opinions on the comprehensive utilization of coal.

Coal is a priceless treasure. It not only contains a large amount of heat energy, but is also an important industrial raw material. From coal, tens of thousands or even hundreds of thousands of new products can be processed. These products are not found in natural substances. It can be used for coking, oil refining, and extracting nitrogen fertilizer, plastics, synthetic fibers, explosives, medicines, pesticides, and other chemical products. It can be said that the world has today's appearance is inseparable from mankind's comprehensive utilization of coal. Without these materials, it would be difficult to imagine that any sector of the modern national economy could achieve normal development at such a high technical level. Due to the progress of atomic energy, jet technology, and electronic computer technology in the past fifteen to twenty years, a new era has begun. A series of new synthetic materials have emerged in practical life, and most of these materials are obtained from coal.

China's coal resources are extremely rich. Our coal reserves are very large. In the past, it was believed that some provinces in China did not produce coal. During the Great Leap Forward in 1958, especially after the mass steelmaking campaign, many new coalfields were discovered everywhere. The reserves are increasing several times over the original 1.5 trillion tons, making China one of the countries with the largest reserves in the world. Taking Shanxi Province as an example, 75% of the counties in the province produce coal, and all four special districts in the province have a very large amount of coking coal. The reserves of coal with a high oil content are also very large. There is also sapropelic coal with an oil content of 20% to 40% (which can be lit with a match, locally called "tangen," also known as "youhulu"). Shanxi Province has many types of high-quality coal, such as Datong coal with low ash and phosphorus content; the coking coal in Xishan of Taiyuan and Xinzhi of Huoxian also have very low sulfur and ash content; the anthracite and lanhua charcoal in Jincheng area of ​​southeastern Shanxi have very little phosphorus and do not require chimneys for stoves. The locals call it fragrant charcoal, which is a good raw material for gas production. The example of Shanxi Province illustrates how rich our motherland's resources are!

Directly burning coal is a huge waste. China's coal production is very large. In 1958, 270 million tons were produced, and in 1959, the plan is for 380 million tons. This shows the leap-forward development of China's industry. In terms of comprehensive utilization of coal, there has also been great development in recent years, but from a level point of view, most of it is still at a relatively low level—direct combustion. The utilization rate of heat is very low, and what is even more regrettable is that a large amount of oil and chemical raw materials are burned for nothing. If based on general bituminous coal, 100 million tons of coal processed by low-temperature dry distillation can extract 7 million to 8 million tons of coal tar. Processing these coal tars can obtain 5 to 6 million tons of various oil products such as gasoline and diesel (if each car uses 10 tons of fuel per year, it can supply 500,000 to 600,000 cars for one year); nearly 1 million tons of ammonium sulfate chemical fertilizer can also be recovered at the same time. If the same 100 million tons of coal are processed by high-temperature dry distillation, 1 million tons of crude benzene, 1 million tons of ammonium sulfate, and 3 million tons of coal tar can be obtained. A large amount of chemical raw materials can be extracted from these coal tars. Using processed coke and semi-coke as fuel, the utilization rate of heat will be higher than directly burning raw coal, so not comprehensively utilizing coal is a huge waste.

Developing comprehensive utilization of coal is entirely possible. First of all, China's coal reserves are very large, and the current production figures are also very large. The plan for this year is 380 million tons. If comprehensive utilization can solve a big problem.

Secondly, under the superiority of China's socialist system, under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and under the banner of exerting great effort, striving for the upper reaches, and building socialism in a more, faster, better, and more economical way, with the Great Leap Forward in industrial and agricultural production, China's comprehensive utilization of coal will surely have great development. Comprehensive utilization of coal is the most powerful technical and economic policy to achieve more, faster, better, and more economical results. It can promote the development of industry, agriculture, transportation, and various sectors of the national economy; it can also comprehensively utilize resources and save national investment. The experience of 1958 proves that not only foreign methods can be comprehensively utilized, but also indigenous methods can be comprehensively utilized. The Datong Automobile School used the indigenous method of stack dry distillation. A stack furnace with an annual output of 300 tons of crude oil, in addition to producing semi-coke and crude oil, the produced coal gas supplied the fuel needed for a boiler, saving four tons of coal per day. This is a very good example.

Thirdly, the technical conditions for realizing comprehensive utilization of coal are basically available. During the first Five-Year Plan period, especially in the Great Leap Forward of 1958, both indigenous and foreign methods have made great progress. For example, in terms of indigenous methods, stack dry distillation has been promoted in many places. A special district in northern Shanxi Province has built 214 stacks with a production capacity of about 23,000 tons, and has trained 1,717 workers. Practice shows that workers who have undergone short-term training can gradually master the technology. Within less than half a year, ten factories had an oil recovery rate of over 80%, and the Makou Oil Refinery had an oil recovery rate of 99%. Another example is the "Red Flag" coke oven, which combines indigenous and foreign methods. From the perspective of four such coke ovens in Shanxi Province, it is a relatively successful furnace type. Changzhi Iron and Steel Plant also achieved success in using simple machinery to pull coke. In foreign methods, large-scale three-stage low-temperature coking furnaces, large-scale high-temperature coking furnace bases, large-scale synthetic ammonia and synthetic oil plants, etc., can all be designed and built by China itself. Some production methods that combine indigenous and foreign methods, such as square gas-fired low-temperature dry distillation furnaces, comprehensive utilization of power technology in power plants, low-temperature dry distillation of pulverized coal, fluidized bed solid heat carrier dry distillation, and furnace-front dry distillation in power plants, have been successful or initially successful. These all show that China's comprehensive utilization of coal can not only use foreign experience, but also create its own experience and create furnace types. Extensive technical teams have been trained in both construction and production. Although it is still difficult to manufacture certain high-pressure equipment in large quantities, some have been successfully trial-produced and put into production. Therefore, there is already a certain foundation in terms of technology.

Furthermore, under the situation of taking steel as the key link and a comprehensive leap forward on the industrial front, the development of all aspects requires the comprehensive utilization of coal to a greater or lesser extent. First of all, high-temperature coking is closely linked to the iron and steel industry and directly serves the iron and steel industry. This year, the large-scale promotion of Red Flag coke ovens will inevitably produce coal tar, and the processing and refining of coal tar from Red Flag furnaces will definitely be on the agenda. Benzene is an extremely scarce substance (a series of important chemical products such as pesticides and synthetic rubber are made from benzene as raw materials). Although there are still some difficulties in the equipment for recovering benzene from Red Flag coke ovens, pilot projects to gain experience and prepare for future recovery. It is entirely possible to add benzene recovery equipment in a relatively short period of time so that all Red Flag coke ovens recover benzene. Because the transportation sector needs a large amount of gasoline and diesel, and China's discovered oil resources cannot meet the needs, low-temperature dry distillation of coal (including shale) will inevitably develop rapidly. The Great Leap Forward in agriculture places urgent demands on nitrogen-containing chemical fertilizers and agricultural plant protection agents. The development of chemical industries such as plastics, synthetic rubber, and synthetic fibers must also mainly take the coal route (the United States and the Soviet Union mainly take the natural oil route). With the development of industry and cities, the coal gas industry will also definitely develop rapidly. These are all inevitable trends in national economic development.

In short, it is necessary and possible for China to rapidly change the situation of low-level utilization of coal (directly burning raw coal) and develop the comprehensive utilization of coal. Of course, the establishment of a complete set of comprehensive coal utilization industries cannot be accomplished overnight. However, as long as we implement the central government's entire set of "walking on two legs" policies, such as large-scale enterprises and small and medium-sized enterprises being developed simultaneously, and foreign production methods and indigenous production methods being developed simultaneously, coal comprehensive utilization industries must be vigorously developed in areas with suitable conditions. In this way, we will leap forward further on the basis of 1958. We believe that China's comprehensive utilization of coal will rapidly catch up with the world level. Let our production materials, construction materials, food, clothing, and supplies all come from coal in the near future. Let coal serve socialist construction and serve communist construction.

### 让煤炭综合利用为建设服务  凌大琦代表的发言

　　让煤炭综合利用为建设服务
    凌大琦代表的发言主席、各位代表：
    我完全拥护周总理的“政府工作报告”，李富春副总理的“关于一九五九年国民经济计划草案的报告”，李先念副总理的“关于一九五八年国家决算和一九五九年国家预算草案的报告”和彭真副委员长的“全国人民代表大会常务委员会的工作报告”。
    我现在就煤炭综合利用问题发表一些意见。
    煤炭是无价之宝。它不但含有大量的热能，而且是重要的工业原料。从煤炭中可以加工成为几万种以至几十万种的新型产品。这些产品都是天然物质所没有的。它可以炼焦、炼油及提取氮肥、塑料、合成纤维、炸药、医药、农药等化工产品。可以说，世界有今天的面貌，是与人类能综合利用煤炭分不开的。如果没有这些材料，便很难想现代国民经济任何一个部门，在目前这样高的技术水平上，能够得到正常的发展。由于近十五年到二十年来原子能、喷气技术、电子计算技术的进展进入了一个新纪元，在实际生活中出现一系列新的合成材料，这些材料多半是从煤炭中取得的。
    我国煤炭资源极为丰富。我国煤炭储量很大。过去认为我国有些省不产煤炭，在一九五八年大跃进中，尤其是大炼钢铁以后，各地普遍发现了许多新的煤田，储量比原来的一万五千亿吨在成倍成倍的增长中，成为世界储量最大的国家之一。即以山西省为例，全省百分之七十五的县产煤，全省四个专区都有很大量的炼焦用煤炭，含油率很高的煤炭储量也很大，还有含油率达百分之二十到百分之四十的腐泥煤（可以用火柴点着，当地叫炭根，又名“油葫芦”）。山西省有许多质量很好的煤炭，如含灰分、含磷都低的大同煤；太原西山及霍县辛置的炼焦煤也是含硫含灰都很低；晋东南晋城一带无烟煤、兰花炭，含磷极少，火炉不要烟囱，当地叫做香炭，是个造气好原料。从山西省的例子说明，祖国的资源是如何的丰富啊！
    煤炭直接的烧掉是个极大的浪费。我国的煤炭产量很大，一九五八年生产两亿七千万吨，一九五九年计划为三亿八千万吨。这说明了我国工业有着飞跃的发展。煤炭综合利用方面，近年也有很大的发展，但是从水平上来看，绝大部分还是停留在比较低级的形式——直接燃烧。热的利用率很低，更可惜的是把大量油品和化工原料白白燃掉。如果以一般烟煤为准，一亿吨煤用低温干馏法加工，就可以提取七百万吨到八百万吨焦油。用这些焦油加工可获得汽油、柴油等各种油品五、六百万吨（如果每辆汽车一年用十吨油料计，可供五、六十万辆汽车一年之用）；还可以同时回收将近一百万吨硫酸铵化学肥料。如同样用一亿吨煤进行高温干馏方法加工，就可以得到一百万吨粗苯、一百万吨硫酸铵及三百万吨焦油。这些焦油中可以提取大量的化工原料。利用加工后的焦炭、半焦作燃料，热的利用率将高于直接燃烧原煤，所以煤炭不综合利用是很大的浪费。
    发展煤炭综合利用是完全有可能的。首先是我国煤炭储量很大，目前生产数字也很大。今年计划即有三亿八千万吨。如果综合利用可以解决很大问题。
    其次，我国社会主义制度的优越性，在中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导下，在鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义的旗帜下，随着工农业生产的大跃进，我国的煤炭综合利用定会有很大的发展。煤炭综合利用就是实现多快好省的最有力的技术经济政策。它能促进工业、农业、交通运输及国民经济各个部门的发展；又能使资源综合利用，节约国家投资。一九五八年的经验证明，不但洋办法可以综合利用，就是土办法也可以综合利用。大同汽车学校用成堆干馏的土办法，一个年产原油三百吨的堆炉，除生产半焦及原油外，所产的煤气就供给了一座锅炉所需燃料，每天节约四吨煤炭，这是一个非常好的例子。
    再次，实现煤炭综合利用的技术条件已基本具备，在第一个五年计划期间内特别是大跃进的一九五八年，无论土法及洋法都有很大的发展。例如在土法方面，成堆干馏已在许多地方推广，山西省晋北一个专区即建了二百一十四个堆，生产能力达两万三千吨左右，并培养了一千七百一十七个工人。实践说明，经短期训练的工人，是能逐步掌握技术的，他们在不到半年的时间内，就有十个工厂采油率达百分之八十以上，而马口炼油厂采油率达百分之九十九。又如土洋结合的“红旗”焦炉，从山西省这样四座焦炉来看，是个比较成功的炉型。长治铁厂用简易机械拉焦也获得成功。在洋办法中，大型三段低温炼焦炉，大型高温炼焦炉基地，大型合成氨、合成石油厂等，我国都能自己设计和建设。有些土洋结合的生产方法，如方型气燃低温干馏炉，发电厂的动力工艺综合利用，粉煤低温干馏，流动床固体热载体干馏及电厂的炉前干馏等技术，已获得成功或初步成功。这些都说明我国煤炭综合利用事业，不但能运用国外经验，并且能自己创造经验，创造炉型。在建设及生产方面都已培养广大的技术队伍。虽然某些高压设备，大批制造还困难，但有的已试制成功，并投入生产，因此，技术方面是已有了一定的基础的。
    还有，工业战线在以钢为纲，全面跃进的形势下，各个方面的发展都或多或少要求煤炭必须综合利用。首先高温炼焦紧密结合钢铁工业，是直接为钢铁服务的。今年大量推广红旗焦炉就必然要产生焦油，红旗炉的焦油加工提炼就一定会排在议事日程上。苯是极缺的物质（农药、合成橡胶等一系列的重要化工产品都是以苯为原料的），红旗焦炉回收苯在设备上，虽还有些困难，但是试点取得经验，为今后回收作好准备，在较短时间内追加回收苯的设备，所有红旗焦炉都回收苯完全是可能的。由于交通运输方面需要大量的汽油、柴油，而我国发现的石油资源还不能满足需要，因此，煤炭（包含页岩）低温干馏就必然会迅速的发展。农业方面大跃进，对含氮化学肥料及农业植物保护药剂有急迫的要求。塑料、合成橡胶、合成纤维等化学工业的发展，也必须主要是走煤的道路（美国与苏联主要是走天然油的道路）。随着工业及都市的发展，煤气工业也一定会迅速发展。这些都是国民经济发展的必然趋势。
    总之，我国迅速改变低级利用煤炭（直接烧原煤）的情况，发展煤炭综合利用事业是有必要与可能的。当然，全套煤炭综合利用工业的建立，不是一个早晨能办到的。但是，只要我们贯彻中央的大型企业和中小型企业同时并举、洋法生产和土法生产同时并举等一整套“两条腿走路”的方针，在有条件的地区，就要大办煤炭综合利用工业。这样，在一九五八年的基础上，就会更向前跃进一步。我们相信，我国煤炭综合利用水平是会迅速赶上世界水平的。让不久的将来，我们的生产原料、建设材料、吃的、穿的、用的，都向煤炭要。让煤炭为社会主义建设服务，为共产主义建设服务。
