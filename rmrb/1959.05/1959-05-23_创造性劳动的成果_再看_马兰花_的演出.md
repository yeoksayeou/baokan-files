    The Fruit of Creative Labor
    ——Re-watching the Performance of "Malan Flower"
    Mei Qian
    "Malan Flower" is a fairy tale play with a beautiful artistic conception, themed around labor and love. The greedy and selfish, lazy Da Lan, the hardworking, brave, pure, and kind Ma Lang and Xiao Lan, as well as the old cat, the embodiment of evil, all left a deep impression on the young audience. In the past, this play was artistically directed and personally rehearsed with the help of Soviet drama expert Comrade Kurinev. It not only achieved great artistic success but was also a flower jointly cultivated by Chinese and Soviet artists.
    This time, it is evident that the comrades of the China Children's Theater have put in a lot of effort and hard work to refine the play, improving it based on the original. This is precisely the fruit of creative labor. I think that the refinement of the retained repertoire must pay attention to two aspects: first, the original director's concept and artistic treatment should be highly respected, and all the advantages should be retained as much as possible; otherwise, there will be no accumulation to speak of. Second, efforts must be made in re-creation, and the original shortcomings cannot be stubbornly clung to; otherwise, there will be no enrichment or improvement to speak of. This refinement of "Malan Flower" can be said to have taken both into account. It is an organic combination of "respect" and "creation," thus making this repertoire not only maintain its stage youth but also shine even more brightly.
    The handling of the main characters and stage scheduling mostly follow the original, which is a faithful reproduction of the original director's concept. Some of the changes, especially the handling of the character Da Lan, I think are very well done and very necessary. Originally, Xiao Lan's harm was due to the joint conspiracy of Da Lan and the old cat. Out of jealousy and greed, Da Lan wanted to snatch the Malan flower, which symbolizes happiness, from Xiao Lan, so she pushed Xiao Lan into the water from the edge of the cliff together with the old cat. Later, the old cat's swallowing of the little bird was also at Da Lan's instigation. When the truth was revealed, Da Lan and the old cat had no choice but to perish together. Handling Da Lan's character in this way inevitably seemed too weighty and too evil. In fact, Da Lan is just a teenage girl, and the conflict occurs between blood sisters, which seems even more unreasonable. In the current performance, Da Lan is changed to being seduced and controlled by the old cat because of selfishness and laziness, leading her astray and deeper and deeper. There is a clear distinction between her and the old cat. This feels more natural and credible, more reasonable, and more measured. As a result, the conflict has not been weakened, and love and hate are still distinct; but when children look at it, they will realize that as long as there are certain bad habits in their thinking and certain shortcomings in their character, there will be a danger of falling and being used by bad people, which can play a more positive educational role. From this, if we add a scene where Da Lan finally recognizes her mistakes and repents, the effect may be even better. Under such changes, I think it is necessary to correspondingly strengthen the depiction of the relationship between Da Lan and the old cat, how Da Lan's weaknesses are discovered and used by the old cat, and how she gradually deepens to achieve complete control, as well as the inevitable contradictions between them, and so on, which are very necessary. This aspect still has obvious shortcomings.
    Secondly, in terms of stage art design, this change is more significant, giving people a refreshing feeling. The overall layout has not been changed, but the artistic style appears more complete and unified. Although the original design also provided a very beautiful fairy tale realm, its foreground tended to be realistic (such as Xiao Lan's house, etc.), and the background tended to be decorative (such as distant mountains and forests, etc.), and there was indeed a lack of coordination between the front and back. This time, the designer basically adopted the single-line flat painting technique of folk prints, focusing on the decorative beauty of the composition, making the entire stage picture more national and fairy tale-like. This intention is very good and worthy of praise. However, there are also some debatable aspects in the specific application. The overall feeling this time is that there is more splendor than beauty. Taking the scene of Ma Lang's house as an example: the layout does appear full of momentum, thick, and smooth; the color tone also appears colorful and dazzling. However, too much rendering loses the quiet and ethereal interest; the full and vivid expression ignores the charm of light and shade. The main body of the scenery is not prominent, nor can it leave the audience with room to expand their imagination. In particular, the parallel display of pine, bamboo, and plum, plus four rows of dense Malan flowers on the left and right, filling the entire stage space, is it somewhat piled up? I think, if it is more refined, more courageous to give up some cumbersome things; if we put more effort into the distance, layers, virtual and real, and strive for clear layers and proper density, will the stage effect be better? Although stage design emphasizes the integrity and prominence of style, its ultimate goal is still to serve the actors' performance, and it should not overwhelm the audience or submerge the characters. Moreover, on the other hand, such scenery also puts forward different requirements for the actors' performance, which must be more rhythmic in movement and more distinct in rhythm, and people and scenery must also maintain a certain distance to avoid destroying the realism caused by the perspective of the scenery. This requires good cooperation, and the adaptation of the director and actors in this regard is still not enough. But this is just a minor flaw, written for reference only.
    In short, I think this performance of "Malan Flower" shows that the comrades of the China Children's Theater are not satisfied with the achievements they have already achieved and strive for a serious work attitude of striving for perfection, and their efforts are welcome.

    创造性劳动的成果
    ——再看“马兰花”的演出
    梅阡
    “马兰花”是一出意境优美、以劳动和爱情为主题的童话剧。剧中的贪婪自私、好吃懒作的大兰，勤劳勇敢、淳真善良的马郎和小兰，以及作为邪恶之化身的老猫等的形象，在儿童观众们的心里都曾留下较深的印象。这出戏过去由苏联戏剧专家库里涅夫同志担任艺术指导，并亲自帮助排练。它不但在艺术水平上获得很高的成就，同时也是中苏艺术工作者共同培育出来的花朵。
    这次演出，看得出中国儿童剧院的同志们，又花了不少心血，又下了不少工夫。对这个戏进行整理，使它在原来的基础上有所提高。这正是创造性劳动的成果。我想对于保留剧目的整理必须注意两个方面：其一，对原来的导演构思和艺术处理，要予以高度的尊重，尽量把一切优点保留下来，否则便谈不上什么积累。其二，又须发挥再度创作的工夫，对原来的不足之处不能抱残守缺，不如此便谈不上丰富与提高。这次“马兰花”的整理可以说是两者兼顾。是“尊重”与“创造”的有机结合，因而使这一剧目不仅保持了舞台青春，而且更有光彩。
    主要的人物处理与舞台调度大都按照原来的样子，是原来导演构思的忠实的再现。而有些改动的地方，特别是关于大兰这个人物的处理，我觉得又改得很好，很有必要。原来小兰的被害是出于大兰和老猫共同的阴谋。大兰为了妒忌、贪婪，要跟小兰抢夺那朵象征幸福的马兰花，就和老猫一起把小兰从悬崖边推下水去。后来老猫的吞食小鸟也是出于大兰的唆使。等到真象揭穿，大兰与老猫的下场也只好是同归于尽。这样处理大兰的性格就未免显得份量过重，恶性太深。其实，大兰不过是个十几岁的女孩子，而矛盾又发生在同胞亲姐妹之间，就更显得不合情理了。现在的演出，把大兰改成因为自私、懒惰而受了老猫的引诱和控制，以致误入歧途，越陷越深。她和老猫之间有了明显的区别。这就觉得比较自然可信，比较合乎情理，有分寸。其结果，矛盾并未削弱，爱憎依然分明；但是叫孩子们看起来，会认识到只要思想上占染某些恶习，品质上存在某些缺点，就会有堕落的危险，就会被坏人利用，更能起积极的教育作用。由此推论，如果再加上大兰终于认识错误、悔过日新的戏，那效果也许会更好一些。在这样的改动下我认为就必须相应地加强大兰与老猫之间关系的描写，大兰的弱点如何被老猫所发现，所利用，又如何步步深入达到完全的控制，以及他们彼此间必然存在的矛盾等等，就十分必要。这方面还显然有不足之处。
    其次，在舞台美术设计方面，这次的改变较为显著。使人感觉耳目一新。整个的布局未动，而在艺术风格上显得更加完整与统一。原来的设计虽然也提供了一幅十分优美的童话境界，但其前景趋于写实（如小兰家的房子等），后景偏于装饰（如远山丛林等），前后确有不够协调之感。这次设计者基本上采取民间版画单线平涂的手法，着意于构图的装饰美，使整个舞台画面更富有民族风格和童话色彩。这意图是很好的，值得赞许。不过在具体运用上也还有一些可以商榷的地方。这次总起来给人的感觉是绚烂有余而优美不足。即以马郎家的一景为例：在布局上确是显得气势饱满，浑厚酣畅；在色调上也显得五彩缤纷，辉煌夺目。但渲染过于浓重，便失掉意境幽渺的情趣；挥洒尽致淋漓，却忽略了浓淡掩映的神韵。景物的主体既不突出，也不能留给观众以展开想像的余地。尤其是松竹梅三物并陈，再加上左右四排茂密的马兰花，充塞了整个的舞台空间，是否有些堆砌之感呢？我想，如果再精炼些，再勇于舍弃一些繁琐的东西；在远近、层次、虚实上再下一番推敲的工夫，作到层次分明，疏密有致，那舞台效果是否会更好些？舞台设计虽讲求风格的完整、突出，但其最后目的还在于为演员的表演服务，不能喧宾夺主，淹没人物。而且另一方面，这样的布景对演员的表演也提出不同的要求，必须是动作更富于韵律，节奏更加鲜明，而且，人与景也须保持一定的距离，以避免破坏景片本身的透视所造成的实感。这需要很好的配合，导演与演员在这方面的适应还显得不够。但这只是美中不足，写来谨供参考。
    总之，我觉得这次“马兰花”的演出，看出中国儿童剧院的同志们不满足于既获的成就，力求精益求精的严肃工作态度，其努力是值得欢迎的。
