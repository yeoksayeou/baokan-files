　　Competing and Cooperating
    Funan Red Flag Commune: All Teams Leap Forward Together
    Hefei, May 5th (Our Dispatch) – The Red Flag Commune in Funan County, Anhui Province, has seen all its production teams achieving simultaneous leaps forward in production by both competing and cooperating, thus demonstrating the superiority of the people's commune.
    After implementing "unified leadership, tiered management," the Red Flag Commune has implemented a system of contracting work and output for each production team. Labor competitions have been launched between brigades and between production teams. In order to better achieve the commune's production increase targets, the commune management committee, based on the differences in manpower and resources between the production teams, decided to carry out necessary cooperation under the principle of "equivalent exchange" ("cooperation" is also one of the contents of the competition assessment).
    To ensure effective cooperation, the commune conducted a round of publicity and discussions on "cooperation" among all cadres and members. Through discussions, members realized that "it takes two hands to clap," and only through mutual cooperation and "mutual exchange" can the overall production increase targets of the entire commune be better achieved.
    On the basis of unified understanding, the commune formulated specific regulations such as "borrowing and returning," and "returning at a depreciated price" for the mutual support of manpower and materials between teams, based on the principle of "equivalent exchange." The Liulin Brigade is a brigade with a relatively good foundation in the entire commune. This team has realized river network management, and the rice planting area has increased. The team alone could not timely produce the required water lifting tools, so the other six brigades dispatched more than forty workers to "cooperate" and quickly made more than 170 waterwheels. The Liulin Brigade then transferred cattle grass to the production teams that lacked cattle grass. For example, the Yaguang Brigade, which had relatively abundant funds, lent 3,000 yuan to the Liunan and Shunhe brigades, enabling these two teams to purchase chemical fertilizers and seeds in time. The Shunhe Brigade planned crop planting areas according to local conditions throughout the team, with rice planned along the riverbanks. However, only two production teams were available, and they were short of labor. Thus, the brigade freed up draft animals and labor within the brigade to support these two production teams.
    Due to both competition and cooperation, the progress of spring production in the Red Flag Commune has been continuously accelerated. All 120,000 mu of wheat in the entire commune have been top-dressed four times. Most of the 53,000 mu of spring-sown land has been applied with sufficient base fertilizer, of which more than 20,000 mu are for rice, and 90% of the field ridges have been built. Spring-sown crops such as corn and hemp have also been planted.

### 边竞赛　边协作  阜南红旗公社各队齐跃进

　　边竞赛　边协作
    阜南红旗公社各队齐跃进
    本报合肥5日电　安徽省阜南县红旗公社各生产队之间边竞赛边协作，发挥了人民公社的优越性，出现了队队生产齐头跃进的局面。
    红旗公社在贯彻执行了“统一领导，分级管理”以后，各生产队实行了包工包产，大队与大队、生产队与生产队之间，都开展了劳动竞赛。公社管理委员会为了更好地实现公社的增产指标，根据各生产队之间人力、物力的差异，决定在“等价交换”的原则下，开展必要的协作（“协作”也是竞赛评比的内容之一）。
    为了搞好协作，这个公社在全体干部和社员中进行了一次关于“协作”的宣传和讨论。经过讨论，社员们认识到“一个巴掌拍不响”，只有互相协作，“互通有无”，才能更好地完成全公社总的增产任务。
    在统一认识的基础上，公社根据“等价交换”的原则，对队与队之间人力物力上的相互支援作出了“有借有还”、“折价归还”等具体规定。柳林大队是全公社基础较好的队，这个队实现了河网化，水稻栽种面积增加，所需提水工具只靠本队很难及时赶制出来，于是另外六个大队就抽出了四十多名工人去“协作”，很快制好了一百七十多部水车。而柳林大队就把牛草调运给缺牛草的生产队。又如，资金比较充裕的亚光大队，借给柳南、顺河两个大队三千元，使这两个队及时购买了化学肥料和种籽。顺河大队在全队范围内因地制宜地规划了作物种植区，水稻都规划在靠河道的两岸，而这里只有两个生产小队，劳力忙不过来，于是在大队内部腾出耕畜和劳动力，支援这两个生产小队。
    由于边竞赛边协作，红旗公社春季生产进度不断地加快。全社十二万多亩小麦，都追了四遍肥。五万三千多亩春种地里，大都施足了基肥，其中两万多亩水稻，90％的田埂都已打好。玉米、大麻等春种作物，也都种上了。
