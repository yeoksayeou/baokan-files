(Our dispatch from Xi'an on the 28th) In the midst of summer harvest preparations, Shaanxi is vigorously rectifying and improving rural collective living welfare undertakings such as canteens, nurseries, and kindergartens to ensure the completion of this year's summer harvest tasks.

In rectifying rural canteens and nurseries, all localities have paid attention to starting from the voluntary participation of the masses and benefiting the summer harvest, and finding various good methods according to local conditions. In the Lianghekou Management Area of the Gaochuan Commune in Xixiang County, there are thirty-one small teams, twenty-two of which are on high mountains. Commune members work on the mountain and eat at the foot of the mountain. A round trip for a meal takes more than ten li, taking up a lot of production time and exhausting the commune members. Therefore, in this rectification, it was decided to set up mobile canteens (bringing stoves, grain, vegetables, etc. to the construction site to cook), so that wherever production is, the canteen moves to. The commune members all said: "The canteen goes up the slope, and the benefits are really many." After these places rectified collective living welfare undertakings, the summer harvest labor force increased. After Ningqiang County rectified canteens, nurseries, and kindergartens, more than 9,700 women who could not participate in agricultural production were put into the summer harvest.

    把食堂托儿所办得更好
    陕西整顿集体生活福利事业
    本报西安28日电　陕西各地在夏收准备中、大力整顿和提高食堂、托儿所、幼儿园等农村集体生活福利事业，以保证完成今年的夏收任务。
    各地在整顿农村食堂、托儿所中，都注意了从群众自愿和有利于夏收出发，因地制宜地找出种种好办法。西乡县高川公社两河口管理区，共有三十一个小队，其中二十二个都在高山上，社员在山上劳动，山下吃饭，一顿饭往返要十多里路，占用了不少生产时间，社员也劳累不堪。因此在这次整顿中，决定举办流动食堂（把灶具、粮食、菜等带到工地做饭），做到生产在哪里，食堂搬到哪里。社员们都说：“食堂上了坡，好处实在多。”这些地方整顿集体生活福利事业以后，夏收劳动力增多了。宁强县经过整顿食堂、托儿所、幼儿园以后，原来不能参加农业生产的九千七百多个妇女都投入了夏收。
