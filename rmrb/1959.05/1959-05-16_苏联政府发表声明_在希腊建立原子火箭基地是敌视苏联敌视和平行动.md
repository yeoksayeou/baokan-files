Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, May 14th: The Soviet government, in a memorandum to the Greek government on May 13th, declared that the Greek government's agreement to establish atomic rocket bases on Greek territory would be considered a hostile act against the Soviet Union and the maintenance of peace, thereby causing serious damage to Soviet-Greek relations.

The Soviet government's memorandum was delivered by Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Firyubin to the Greek Ambassador to Moscow, Babbas, on May 13th.

The memorandum stated that the Soviet government's concern over the plan to establish American atomic rocket bases in Greece stems from the Soviet Union's desire to prevent further escalation of international tensions and its hope to not only maintain but further develop the traditional friendly ties between the Soviet and Greek peoples.

The Soviet Union believes that the Balkan Peninsula can and should become a truly peaceful region and a region of friendly cooperation among Balkan countries. The Soviet side is willing to vigorously assist in this noble cause.

The memorandum drew attention to the fact that preparations for implementing atomic armament and establishing atomic rocket bases on the territory of certain member states of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization are being carried out at a time when the international situation has seen some relaxation, and major powers have agreed to hold foreign ministers' and high-level meetings to resolve ripe international issues. The memorandum pointed out that it is quite obvious that the hidden purpose of intensified measures in atomic and rocket armament is that certain countries want to present the conference participants with a fait accompli, nullify the possibility of reaching an agreement, and undermine efforts aimed at halting the "Cold War" and easing international tensions.

    苏联政府发表声明
    在希腊建立原子火箭基地是敌视苏联敌视和平行动
    新华社14日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联政府13日在给希腊政府的备忘录中声明，希腊政府同意在希腊境内建立原子火箭基地一事，将被认为是敌视苏联和敌视维护和平的行动，从而会给苏希关系带来严重损失。
    苏联政府的这份备忘录由苏联外交部副部长费留宾在13日交给了希腊驻莫斯科大使巴巴斯。
    备忘录说，苏联政府所以对在希腊境内建立美国原子火箭基地的计划感到不安，是因为苏联希望阻止国际紧张局势的进一步加剧，希望不仅保持，而且进一步发展苏希两国人民之间的传统友好联系。
    苏联认为，巴尔干半岛可以而且应当成为真正和平的地区和巴尔干国家友好合作的地区。苏联方面愿意大力协助这一崇高的事业。
    备忘录提请注意，为了实现原子武装和在北大西洋公约组织某些成员国境内建立原子火箭基地计划而做的准备活动，是在国际局势有了一定和缓，大国商定举行外长会议和高级会议解决业已成熟的国际问题的情况下进行的。备忘录指出，十分明显，在原子和火箭武装方面加紧采取措施，其隐藏的目的是某些国家想把会议参加者置于既成事实面前，使达成协议的可能性化为乌有，破坏旨在停止“冷战”和缓和国际紧张局势的努力。
