Silkworm Goddess (Nursery Rhyme)
The little girls from Liang Shangquan Kindergarten,
Are busily picking mulberry leaves under the sun;
Picking mulberry leaves, busily picking mulberry leaves,
Carrying a small bamboo basket in their hands;
Although the bamboo basket is small, their hearts are big,
In a moment, they pick several hundred leaves;
Several hundred mulberry leaves are tender and green,
Feeding several hundred silkworms until they are plump;
The plump silkworms spin long silk,
Forming cocoons that are like flowers;
The flower-like big cocoons,
The flower-like little girls;
The little girls still need the goddess to take care of them,
But they themselves have become silkworm goddesses!

    蚕娘娘（儿歌）
    梁上泉幼儿园的小姑娘，太阳底下采桑忙；采桑忙，忙采桑，手上提了个小竹筐；竹筐虽小心儿大，一会就采了几百张；几百张桑叶嫩青青，几百条蚕儿喂得胖；胖胖的蚕儿吐丝长，结成茧子花一样；花一样的大茧子，花一样的小姑娘；小姑娘还要娘娘管，自己又当了蚕娘娘！
