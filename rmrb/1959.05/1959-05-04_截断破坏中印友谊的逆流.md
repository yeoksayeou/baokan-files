Cutting Off the Countercurrents Sabotaging Sino-Indian Friendship

Speech by Representative Ding Xilin

Chairman, esteemed representatives, esteemed committee members:

I fully agree with and endorse the reports by Premier Zhou Enlai and other leading comrades. Now I would like to discuss the importance of the great friendship between the peoples of China and India in light of the current relations between our country and our friendly neighbor, India.

Currently, under the conspiracy and planning of imperialism, and with the collusion of Tibetan rebels and Indian expansionists, the friendly relations between the two great neighbors, China and India, are encountering certain difficulties. This is a major event concerning the peaceful and friendly lives of the people of our country and the people of India, and even the people of all Asian countries, and cannot but arouse our deep concern.

The great friendship between the peoples of China and India was originally formed in the history of thousands of years of friendly exchanges and cultural exchange. There have never been any unpleasant disputes between our two countries. Therefore, this friendship has deep roots and abundant vitality. In the past century, the people of the two countries have supported each other in the struggle against imperialism and for national independence, making this friendship even stronger. Especially since the great Indian people gained independence and the People's Republic of China was founded, the friendly relations between the two great neighbors, firmly established on a new basis, have provided an example for handling mutual relations to all countries. The Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence jointly advocated by the leaders of the two countries have had an extremely far-reaching impact on the world. At the same time, for nearly ten years, friendly exchanges and cultural exchange between the two countries have been developing rapidly, and the flowers and fruits of friendship have been blooming and ripening in people's lives. All of these are things that the people of China and India are proud of, and are also extremely gratifying to the people of Asia and even the East. Because the facts show that the Sino-Indian friendly relations, which are constantly developing and consolidating on the basis of the "Five Principles," and the great friendship that is deeply rooted and prospering in people's lives, are not only one of the reliable guarantees of the peace and happiness of the ten hundred million people of the two countries, but also have extremely important significance for Asian peace and collective security, and for the struggle of the entire Eastern people against imperialism and for national independence. Therefore, the people of the world welcome the development of this friendship. Only the imperialists and their small handful of followers hate it and try their best to sabotage it.

It is not a new thing that imperialists are heartbroken by the friendly unity of the Asian people. For hundreds of years, one of the main magic weapons of imperialism in carrying out colonial enslavement in the East has been to split the friendly unity of the Eastern countries and nations, and take advantage of the opportunity to reap profits. Today, the people of all countries have reunited and have overthrown colonial rule in most areas, but this has not made the imperialists give up. They are still struggling in every possible way. For example, the notorious Southeast Asia Treaty and the Baghdad Treaty are the two major conspiracy organizations used by imperialism today to split the Asian people and instigate them to kill each other. The imperialists know very well that the friendly unity of the ten hundred million people of China and India is an iron wall erected in front of it in the Eastern world. If they do not open it first, they will be battered and even shattered to pieces. Therefore, the imperialists try their best to slander and provoke, trying to undermine the friendly unity of the people of China and India. The recent Tibetan rebellion, in the eyes of the imperialists, is a good opportunity to show their skills. Therefore, they began to dig the foundation of this iron wall. The armed rebellion of the reactionary group in Tibet, China, occurred under the long-term planning of imperialism and its agents. Now that the rebellion has been quickly put down and this shameful conspiracy has met its due end, the imperialists should go and grieve for their own fate. But no, they still want to take this opportunity to make waves and undermine Sino-Indian friendly relations, attempting to recover the old capital that has already been lost. They use various despicable tricks such as fanning the flames and behind-the-scenes instigation, directing a small handful of people in India who interfere in our country to clamor wantonly, attempting to stir up a countercurrent against China in India and even the entire Southeast Asia, so as to disturb the peaceful life of the Asian people and achieve their long-cherished goal of making a comeback. There is no doubt that this new conspiracy of imperialism can only end in tragedy, and the tree of friendship between the people of China and India will not be damaged by any temporary evil winds and rains.

Originally, China's elimination of a small number of rebels on its own territory, and thus exposing and cracking down on the sinister lair of imperialist activities in carrying out conspiracies on the Sino-Indian border, is only beneficial and not harmful to the further consolidation of friendly relations between China and India, to the security and prosperity of India, and to the peaceful and happy life of the Indian people. In fact, it is precisely based on this correct understanding that the broad masses of the Indian people have expressed joy and congratulations on the victory of the Chinese people, and the fair and just public opinion circles in India have also responded one after another, and aimed at the conspiracies of imperialists and interventionists, clearly pointing out that China's internal affairs must not be interfered with, "Panchsheel" must not be destroyed, and Sino-Indian friendship must not be damaged. The All-India India-China Friendship Association also passed a resolution on April 12 for this purpose. The resolution said, "Tibet is an inseparable part of the People's Republic of China," which "should be respected by all parties concerned," but "the National Committee also notes with uneasiness that certain imperialist countries are ecstatic about this internal strife and even propose to provide assistance. … This is a serious violation of the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries as embodied in Panchsheel." The resolution went on to say: "This interference by foreign imperialists in the affairs of the People's Republic of China not only endangers the interests and security of the People's Republic of China, including Tibet, but also endangers the interests and security of India. Therefore, the National Committee is convinced that in such a very important matter, the People's Republic of China cannot take any risks to tolerate this interference." The resolution emphasized that "the recent events in Tibet should not be allowed to affect the friendly relations between China and India," and called on "the Indian people, especially the staff and leaders of various political parties, to continue to redouble their efforts to develop the friendship between India and China, to strive for the freedom and unity of the people of Asia and Africa, and to strive for world peace." We believe that these points in the above resolution basically express the inner feelings and hopes of the Indian people, and are welcomed by the Chinese people.

However, it is also worth pointing out that, in addition to all these fair and friendly voices, a small handful of people in India who interfere in our internal affairs and some Indian politicians have issued absurd remarks and clamors. Under the instigation of imperialism, they are also afraid that the world will not be in chaos, and do not hesitate to use means such as creating rumors, slanders, and distorting historical facts to incite people's hearts, and even abuse solemn words such as "national sentiments" and "religious sentiments" to serve their own dirty conspiracies. According to them, it seems that it is not the imperialists and their echoers who are interfering in China's internal affairs, but China who is interfering in India's internal affairs. This is really turning black and white upside down and is extremely shameless! Especially after the so-called "Dalai Lama's statement" was distributed, they became even more hot-headed and even had some fanciful ideas. Their voices are already in the same tune or identical to the "Voice of America." They have simply inherited the mantle of British imperialism, which has aroused great indignation among the people of our country. It should be said that this is indeed a countercurrent that currently threatens the friendly relations between the people of China and India. It is playing a destructive role and is therefore worthy of serious vigilance from Indian friends and the Indian people.

As a person in charge of the Sino-Indian Friendship Association, I am particularly concerned about the future of the great friendship between the people of China and India in these days. I know that this deeply rooted and leafy tree of friendship is now encountering a gust of evil wind and rain. This is a test, but I firmly believe that it can pass successfully. In the past few years, I have visited our great neighbor three times, and at the same time received hundreds of Indian friends in China. In that ancient and beautiful country, I was warmly surrounded by the Indian people everywhere, heard the song "India and China are brothers" everywhere, and felt everywhere that India is a great nation with a lofty sense of self-esteem and great respect for other countries. Today, these scenes and feelings are still active in my memory. This is the great friendship in the hearts of the people of China and India, which can never be washed away by a small dirty countercurrent. The people of our two countries are seriously vigilant and are rising up to fight back against the provocations of imperialist interventionists and their echoers, to defend the great tradition of friendship and "Panchsheel," and to strive for the consolidation of Asian peace and security and the friendly relations between the people of all countries. Our struggle will surely be victorious!

### 截断破坏中印友谊的逆流

    截断破坏中印友谊的逆流
    丁西林代表的发言主席，各位代表，各位委员：
    我完全同意并拥护周恩来总理以及其他几位领导同志的报告。现在我想就目前我国与友邦印度的关系，谈一谈中印两国人民的伟大友谊的重要性。
    目前，在帝国主义的阴谋策划下，在西藏叛乱分子和印度扩张主义分子的相互呼应下，中印两大邻邦的友好关系遇到了某些困难。这是关系到我国人民和印度人民乃至亚洲各国人民的和平友好生活的大事，不能不引起我们十分关心。
    中印两国人民的伟大友谊本来是在数千年友好往来和文化交流的历史中形成的。我们两国之间从来没有过不愉快的纠纷。因此这种友谊具有深厚的根基和充沛的生命力。近百年内，两国人民更在反对帝国主义和争取民族独立的斗争中相互支援，使这种友谊变得更加坚强了。特别是自从伟大的印度人民获得独立和中华人民共和国成立以后，两大邻邦在新的基础上巩固地建立起来的友好关系，向各国提供了处理相互间关系的范例，两国领导人共同提倡的和平共处五项原则，更在全世界发生了极为深远的影响。同时，将近十年以来，两国之间的友好往来和文化交流在迅速地发展，友谊的鲜花硕果在人民生活中普遍地开放和成熟。所有这些，都是中印两国人民引以为骄傲的、同样也是亚洲乃至东方各国人民所极为欣慰的事情。因为事实说明，在“五项原则”的基础上不断地发展和巩固的中印友好关系，在人民生活中深深地扎根繁荣的伟大友谊，不仅是两国十亿人民的和平幸福的可靠保证之一，而且对于亚洲的和平和集体安全，对于整个东方人民的反对帝国主义、争取民族独立的斗争，都有十分重大的意义。因此，全世界人民都欢迎这种友谊的发展，只有帝国主义及其一小撮追随者们才厌恶它，并处心积虑地要破坏它。
    帝国主义者对于亚洲人民的友好团结痛心疾首，这不是什么新鲜的事。数百年来，帝国主义在东方进行殖民奴役的主要法宝之一就是分裂东方各国和各民族的友好团结，自己乘隙而入，坐收渔利。如今，各国人民重新团结起来了，并且在大部分地区推翻了殖民统治，但是这并没有使帝国主义者心甘罢休，他们仍然在千方百计地挣扎。例如臭名远扬的东南亚条约和巴格达条约，就是帝国主义今天用以分裂亚洲人民并唆使他们自相残杀的两大阴谋组织。帝国主义者很清楚，中印两国十亿人民的友好团结是东方世界竖立在它面前的一堵铁墙，如果不首先把它打开，就将使自己碰得头破血流，甚至粉身碎骨。因此帝国主义就千方百计地中伤挑拨，力图破坏中印两国人民的友好团结，最近发生的西藏叛乱事件，在帝国主义看来正是大显身手的一个良好机会，因此它便动起手来要挖掘这堵铁墙的墙脚。我国西藏反动集团的武装叛乱是在帝国主义及其代理人的长期策划下发生的。现在叛乱已经迅速平定，这个可耻的阴谋已经落得应有的下场，照理帝国主义者可以去为自己的命运悲泣了。但是不然，它们还要借此兴风作浪，破坏中印友好关系，企图从中捞回业已蚀掉的老本。它们以煽风点火和幕后策动等种种卑劣伎俩，指使印度的一小撮干涉我国的人放肆叫嚣，企图在印度乃至整个东南亚掀起一股反对中国的逆流，来搅混亚洲人民的和平生活，达到其梦寐以求的卷土重来的目的。毫无疑问，帝国主义的这一新的阴谋也只能以悲剧告终，中印两国人民的友谊的大树是不会为任何暂时的邪风恶雨所损害的。
    本来，中国人民消灭自己领土上的少数叛乱分子，并从而揭露和打击帝国主义在中印边界进行阴谋活动的罪恶渊薮，这对于中印两国友好关系的进一步巩固，对于印度的安全、繁荣，以及对于印度人民的和平幸福生活，都是只有益处而无丝毫损害的。事实上，正是基于这种正确的认识，印度广大人民对于中国人民的胜利表示了欢欣庆贺的态度，印度的公正舆论界也纷纷响应，并针对帝国主义和干涉者的阴谋，明白指出中国内政不得干与，“潘查希拉”不容破坏，中印友谊不能损害。印度印中友好协会全国委员会并在四月十二日为此通过了一项决议。决议说，“西藏是中华人民共和国不可分割的部分”，这“应当受到各有关方面的尊重”，但“全国委员会还不安地注意到，某些帝国主义国家对这个内部纷争欣喜若狂，甚至还提议要给予援助。……这是对潘查希拉所体现的不干涉他国内政的原则的严重破坏。”决议接着说：“外国帝国主义者对中华人民共和国事务的这种干涉，不仅危及包括西藏在内的中华人民共和国的利益和安全，而且危及印度的利益和安全。因此，全国委员会确信，在这种极其重大的问题上，中华人民共和国不可能冒任何危险来容忍这种干涉。”决议着重指出，“不应当让西藏最近发生的事件影响中印两国的友好关系”，并呼吁“印度人民，特别是各个政党的工作人员和领袖们继续加倍努力，为发展印中两国的友谊、为争取亚非国家人民的自由和团结，以及为争取世界和平而奋斗。”我们认为上述决议中的这几点基本上说出了印度人民内心的感觉和希望，是中国人民所欢迎的。
    但是，也值得指出，在所有这些公正而友好的呼声之外，印度一小撮干涉我国内政的人和某些印度的政治家却发出了荒谬的言论和叫嚣。他们在帝国主义的怂恿下，也惟恐天下不乱，不惜用造谣、污蔑和歪曲历史事实等手段来煽惑人心，甚至滥用“民族感情”和“宗教感情”等庄严字眼来为自己肮脏的阴谋服务。按照他们的说法，好像不是帝国主义者及其应声虫在干涉中国的内政，而是中国在干涉印度的内政似的。这真是颠倒黑白，无耻已极！特别是在所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”散发以后，他们更加头脑发热，甚至有些异想天开了。他们的声音已经和“美国之音”异曲同工或者毫无二致，他们简直是继承了英帝国主义的衣钵，这引起了我国人民极大的愤慨。应该说，这的确是目前威胁到中印两国人民友好关系的一股逆流，它正在起破坏作用，因而是值得印度朋友们和印度人民严重警惕的。
    作为中印友好协会的一个负责人，在这些日子我特别关心中印两国人民伟大友谊的前途。我知道，这棵根深叶茂的友谊的大树现在遇到了一阵邪风恶雨。这是一个考验，但是我坚决相信它能胜利地通过。过去几年中我曾三次访问我们的伟大邻邦，同时在国内接待过数以百计的印度朋友。在那个古老而美丽的国家里，我到处受到印度人民的热情包围，到处听到“印度中国是兄弟”的歌声，到处感觉到印度是一个具有崇高的自尊感，而又十分尊重别的国家的伟大民族。今天，这些情景和感觉仍然在我的记忆中活动，这是中印两国人民心中的伟大友情，绝不是一小股污浊的逆流所能冲洗掉的。我们两国人民正在严重警惕，正在奋起回击帝国主义干涉者及其应声虫的挑衅，为保卫伟大的友谊传统和“潘查希拉”而斗争，为巩固亚洲的和平安全和各国人民的友好关系而斗争。我们的斗争一定会胜利！
