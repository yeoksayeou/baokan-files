Comrades,

I wholeheartedly support Premier Zhou's government work report, the reports of the two Vice Premiers Li, the report of Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and the report of Vice Chairman Li Weihan on the work of the CPPCC Standing Committee. These reports make us deeply appreciate that only under the socialist system, with the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, can we have such brilliant achievements. Looking forward to the bright future of the motherland, I feel boundless excitement and encouragement.

Since the Great Leap Forward, especially after the establishment of people's communes in rural areas, in order to develop production and liberate female labor, every production team of every people's commune across the country has established nurseries and kindergartens under the leadership of the Party committee. Early childhood education has become an important part of today's rural life in China. The Party Central Committee pointed out in its resolution on certain issues concerning people's communes that "nurseries and kindergartens should be run well, so that every child lives and is educated better than at home, and the children are willing to stay there, and the parents are willing to put their children there." Comrade Liu Shaoqi also pointed out that attention should be paid to raising the level of kindergarten teachers to that of early childhood normal schools. There are more than 20,000 people's communes in the country. If each production team has a kindergarten, more than one million kindergarten teachers will be needed. At present, there are only dozens of early childhood normal schools and a few higher normal colleges with early childhood education majors in our country. How can we complete the task of training so many kindergarten teachers for the whole country? Recently, after inspecting the training of early childhood education teachers in Jiangsu Province, I realized that as long as we implement the Party's policy of "walking on two legs" and combining popularization with improvement, this problem can be solved easily.

In Jiangsu Province, the early childhood education major of Nanjing Normal College and two early childhood normal schools are responsible for the cultivation of early childhood teachers and kindergarten teachers at the levels of higher normal and secondary normal education, as well as the improvement of early childhood education. Since the Party put forward instructions on teaching reform, students of both the normal college and the normal schools have gone to the countryside to participate in labor. While implementing the Party's policy of combining education with productive labor, they also organized short-term training classes in various places, compiled teaching materials, and popularized early childhood education throughout the province in light of the needs of kindergarten development in various places under the leadership of Party committees at all levels, achieving very good results and enabling early childhood education to play a role in serving proletarian politics.

In addition, Jiangsu Province, under the leadership of Party committees at all levels, has adopted various forms on the basis of mobilizing and relying on the masses to improve the political and professional level of kindergarten teachers.

First, short-term training classes.

This method enables kindergarten teachers without professional knowledge to initially clarify the political significance of running kindergartens within a few days and master some basic knowledge of educating children. It is a method that is fast, efficient, and economical. In addition to being organized by students of Nanjing Normal College and normal schools when they go to the countryside, such short-term training classes are also organized separately by various cities, counties, and people's communes. Now all kindergarten teachers in the province have undergone such short-term training, which has popularized early childhood education.

Second, spare-time early childhood normal schools are a form of training for systematically improving the on-the-job kindergarten teachers.

This kind of organization can provide kindergarten teachers with a regular and systematic opportunity to improve their professional knowledge and political and cultural level after receiving popular training in short-term training classes. They gather for study for two and a half days every week or one day on Sundays. The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Education also compiled a set of teaching materials for spare-time early childhood normal schools based on the experience of Nanjing Normal College and normal schools going to the countryside. According to their current plan, the study period for spare-time early childhood normal schools is one to three years, and they are required to reach the level of junior early childhood normal school graduates. The teachers of spare-time early childhood normal schools are mostly selected locally: one type is experienced kindergarten directors with a certain level of expertise in the local area, and the other type is primary school teachers.

Third, teaching and research groups are organizations for kindergarten teachers to study and solve problems in daily teaching.

In this way, teachers can further improve after studying in short-term training classes or in conjunction with spare-time early childhood normal school studies by giving play to the strength of the collective. This form can also be used for popularization. For example, the Hongqi People's Commune in Liyang County, Jiangsu Province, participants in spare-time early childhood normal school studies are teachers from the central kindergartens of each production brigade. After each study session, they organize teaching and research group activities for research and discussion. Later, they return to their respective production brigades to lead the teachers of all kindergartens in the team to conduct teaching and research group activities, convey the spare-time early childhood normal school studies, and organize discussions. Therefore, after the improvement from the spare-time early childhood normal school studies, popularization is carried out through teaching and research groups.

Fourth, half-work, half-study early childhood normal schools.

This is another form of combining popularization with improvement. For example, the Huashi People's Commune in Jiangyin County, Jiangsu Province, within the middle school, uses the school buildings and teachers of the middle school to attach a class of half-work, half-study early childhood normal school. Students study for half a day and participate in labor on campus or return to their production team to work for half a day. The study period is one year. After graduation, they are assigned to serve as kindergarten teachers in various production teams of the commune, and at the same time, a group of current kindergarten teachers are replaced to study at the half-work, half-study early childhood normal school. Such circular rotation can continuously improve the level of kindergarten teachers and the teaching quality of kindergartens. Moreover, because the political and professional level of teachers who have undergone this kind of study is generally higher, they can lead the study of spare-time early childhood normal schools and the activities of teaching and research groups when they return to the production team, and can also improve the quality of these two types of study.

By adopting these diverse training methods, and in practice combining and promoting each other, the level of kindergarten teachers has been universally improved, and the kindergarten work of various people's communes will continue to improve and popularize.

Under the guidance of the Party's policy of combining education with productive labor, teachers and students of Nanjing Normal College and normal schools will regularly go to the countryside every year in the future. They can bring more systematic professional knowledge to the countryside, so that short-term training classes, spare-time early childhood normal schools, and half-work, half-study early childhood normal schools in rural areas can be universally improved. On the other hand, the new experiences created in practice by kindergarten teachers of people's communes through various forms of study are good learning models for normal colleges and normal schools. These experiences created in practice can not only enrich theory, but more importantly, they can enable teachers and students of normal colleges and normal schools to improve their political understanding and further clarify the direction of education serving proletarian politics. Therefore, the various forms of early childhood education studies handled in various places also help normal colleges and normal schools improve their learning quality and teaching quality.

Adopting the Party's policy of "walking on two legs" to popularize and improve early childhood education is not limited to Jiangsu Province. At present, the early childhood education majors of many normal colleges in our country (such as normal colleges in Southwest, Northwest, and Central China, as well as Beijing Normal University, Northeast Normal University, etc.), and dozens of early childhood normal schools across the country, are actively implementing the Party's education policy. They are not only responsible for the task of improvement, but also go to the countryside and factories to organize training classes and engage in the popularization of early childhood education under the leadership of local Party committees. Party committees at all levels in various localities have also established a variety of teacher training methods. As long as we earnestly implement the Party's method of combining improvement with popularization, the work of early childhood education in our country will inevitably be rapidly improved, so that the next generation of building communism can receive better education.

The early childhood education undertaking is both education work and life and welfare work. In the future, with the continuous development of production, life and welfare undertakings must also be continuously expanded and improved. Therefore, the requirements for running nurseries and kindergartens well and educating children well are becoming increasingly urgent. The Party gives kindergarten teachers various learning opportunities, so that we can continuously improve politically and professionally. As a kindergarten teacher, I feel infinitely honored for the tasks entrusted to us by the Party and the people. I must strive to study the theories of Marxism-Leninism, Chairman Mao's writings, and the Party's policies and guidelines, transform my thinking in labor and work practice, and do a good job in early childhood education under the leadership of the Party.

　　多快好省地培训幼儿园教师
    关瑞梧委员的发言各位委员：
    我衷心拥护周总理的政府工作报告、两位李副总理的报告、彭真副委员长的报告以及李维汉副主席关于政协常委会工作的报告。这些报告使我们深深体会到，只有社会主义制度下，有中国共产党和毛主席的英明领导，才可能有这样辉煌的成就。展望祖国灿烂的前途，我感到无限的兴奋和鼓舞。
    自从大跃进以来，尤其是各地农村成立人民公社以后，为了发展生产，为了解放妇女劳动力，全国每个人民公社的每个生产队都在党委的领导下建立了托儿所和幼儿园。幼儿教育已经成为今天我国农村生活的重要内容之一。党中央在关于人民公社若干问题的决议中曾指出“要办好托儿所和幼儿园，使每一个孩子比在家里生活得好、教育得好，使孩子愿意留在那里，父母也愿意把孩子放在那里。”刘少奇同志也曾指出要注意把幼儿园的师资提高到幼儿师范的水平。全国有二万多个人民公社，若是每个生产队都有幼儿园，就需要一百多万的幼儿园教师。而目前我国只有几十所幼儿师范和几所有幼儿教育专业的高等师范学院，怎样完成为全国训练出这许多幼儿园教师的任务呢？最近我在视察中看过江苏省幼儿教育师资的培训工作后，认识到只要贯彻执行了党的两条腿走路的方针与普及和提高相结合的办法，这个问题就可以迎刃而解。
    在江苏省，有南京师范学院的幼儿教育专业和两所幼儿师范学校分别在高等师范和中级师范的水平担负着幼师和幼儿园师资的培养以及幼儿教育的提高任务，自从党提出了教学改革的指示后，师院和幼师的学生都分别下乡劳动。在贯彻了党的教育与生产劳动相结合的方针的同时，她们还针对各地幼儿园发展的需要，在各级党委领导下，在各地组织了短期训练班，编写了教材，在全省范围内，普及了幼儿教育，获得了很好的效果，使幼儿教育发挥了为无产阶级政治服务的作用。
    此外，江苏省又在各级党委的领导下，在发动群众和依靠群众的基础上，采取了多种形式来提高幼儿园教师的政治和业务水平。
    第一是短期训练班
    这种办法是使没有专业知识的幼儿园教师，在几天之内初步明确了办幼儿园的政治意义，并且掌握了一些教育孩子的基本知识，是一种多快好省的办法。这种短期训练班，除由南京师范学院和幼师的学生下乡时参加办理以外，各市、县、人民公社都分别组织。现在全省的幼儿园教师都经过这种短期训练班的训练，使幼儿教育得到了普及。
    第二是业余幼师，是一种系统地提高在职的幼儿园教师的训练形式
    业余幼师这种组织可以使幼儿园教师在经过短训班的普及训练之后有一个经常地、有系统地提高业务知识和政治、文化水平的机会，她们每周集中两个半天或在星期日一天进行学习。江苏省教育厅还根据南京师院和幼师下乡的经验，为业余幼师编写了一套教材。根据他们目前的计划，业余幼师学习的年限是一年至三年，要求达到初级幼师毕业生的水平。业余幼师的师资多半是就地取材：一种是当地有一定水平的有经验的幼儿园主任，另一种是小学教师。
    第三是教研组，这是幼儿园教师研究解决日常教学中的问题的组织
    这样就可以使教师们在经过短期训练班的学习之后，或者结合着业余幼师的学习，发挥集体的力量，得到进一步提高。通过这种形式，也可以进行普及。例如，江苏省溧阳县的红旗人民公社，参加业余幼师学习的是各生产大队的中心幼儿园的教师，她们每次学习之后就组织教研组的活动，进行研究讨论，以后她们又回到本生产大队领导全队的各个幼儿园的教师进行教研组的活动，传达业余幼师的学习，并且组织讨论。因此，从业余幼师的学习得到提高之后，又通过教研组进行普及。
    第四是半工半读幼儿师范
    这是另一种普及与提高相结合的形式。如江苏省江阴县的华市人民公社，在中学之内，利用中学的校舍和师资，附设了一班半工半读的幼师。学生半天学习，半天参加校内的劳动，或回到本生产队去劳动。学习年限为一年。毕业后分配到公社的各生产队任幼儿园教师，同时替换出一批现任的幼儿园教师到半工半读幼师去学习。如此循环轮换，不断提高幼儿园教师的水平，不断提高幼儿园的教学质量。而且由于经过这种学习的教师的政治业务水平一般都比较高，她们回到生产队，可以领导业余幼师的学习和教研组的活动，也能够提高这两种学习的质量。
    采用了以上这些多种多样的训练方式，而且在实践中又使它们相互结合，相互促进，幼儿园教师的水平，普遍地有所提高，因而各人民公社的幼儿园工作也将不断地提高与普及。
    在党的教育与生产劳动相结合的方针指导下，南京师院和幼师的教师和学生今后每年都定期下乡。她们可以将较系统的专业知识带到农村，使农村的短训班、业余幼师和半工半读幼师普遍地得到提高。另一方面，人民公社的幼儿园教师们通过各种各样形式的学习，在实践中创造出来的新经验，又是师院和幼师很好的学习榜样。这些在实践中创造出来的经验，不但可以丰富理论，更重要的是可以使师院和幼师的师生能够提高政治认识，更加明确教育为无产阶级政治服务的方向。因此，各地办理的种种幼儿教育的学习形式，又帮助师院和幼师提高他们的学习质量和教学质量。
    采取党的两条腿走路的方针来普及和提高幼儿教育，不仅限于江苏一省，目前我国许多师范学院的幼儿教育专业（如西南、西北、华中的师范学院和北京师大、东北师大等），和全国几十所幼儿师范学校，都积极贯彻党的教育方针，不但负着提高的任务，同时也下乡下厂，在当地党委领导下，组织训练班，从事幼儿教育的普及工作。各地方各级党委也都建立了多种多样的师资培训方式。只要认真执行党的提高与普及相结合的办法，我国的幼儿教育工作，必然很迅速地得到提高，使建设共产主义的下一代得到更好的教养。
    幼儿教育事业既是教育工作又是生活福利工作。今后随着生产的不断发展，生活福利事业也一定要不断扩大和提高，因而办好托儿所和幼儿园，把孩子教养好的要求，也越来越迫切。党给幼儿教育的教师各种学习的机会，使我们在政治上、业务上得到不断的提高。我作为一个幼儿教育的教师，对党和人民交给我们的任务，感到无限的光荣。我一定要努力学习马克思列宁主义的理论、毛主席的著作和党的方针政策，在劳动和工作实践中改造思想，在党的领导下，做好幼儿教育工作。
