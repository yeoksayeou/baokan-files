Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, May 14th: A joint statement of talks between the Korean Workers’ Party Central Committee Chairman and Cabinet Premier Kim Il-sung and the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party Central Committee Political Bureau member and Worker-Peasant Revolutionary Government Premier Münnich Ferenc was signed in Pyongyang this afternoon.

The statement said that both sides exchanged views on important issues such as the internal situation of the two parties and countries, the current international situation, the international workers' movement, and the further development of relations between the two countries, and reached unanimous agreement on the issues discussed.

The statement said: "The party and government delegations of the two countries fully support the Soviet government's proposal on concluding a peace treaty with Germany and ending the occupation regime in West Berlin, and believe that this is the most realistic measure to ease the tense situation in Europe and peacefully resolve the German question." The party and government delegations of the two countries resolutely condemned the aggressive policy of U.S. imperialism and its allies to arm West German militarism with atomic weapons and rocket weapons, and to turn West Germany into an aggressive base of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. The statement said: "The party and government delegations of the two countries believe that the Soviet government's series of initiatives on disarmament, immediate cessation of nuclear weapon testing, permanent prohibition of weapons of mass destruction, the establishment of nuclear-weapon-free zones in Europe and Asia, and the conclusion of a non-aggression treaty between Warsaw Pact member states and North Atlantic Treaty Organization member states, are practical measures to ease international tensions and defend peace."

The statement condemned the actions of U.S. imperialism in interfering in the internal affairs of Asian countries. The statement said: "Both sides firmly condemn the United States' occupation of China’s inalienable territory of Taiwan and the plot to create two Chinas, and reiterate that the United States must immediately stop interfering in China's internal affairs and withdraw its troops from the Taiwan area."

The statement said: "Both sides firmly support the Japanese people's struggle for the neutralization of Japan, against the revival of Japanese militarism, and for the abolition of the Japan-U.S. 'Security Treaty.'" The statement said that both sides fully support all efforts by the Democratic Republic of Vietnam for the peaceful reunification of the motherland on the basis of the Geneva Accords. Both sides fully support the struggle of the Algerian people and the people of Asian and African countries for freedom, national independence, and against colonialism.

The statement condemned U.S. imperialism for violating the Korean Armistice Agreement, turning South Korea into a base for atomic warfare, and intensifying the tense situation in Korea. The statement said: There is no reason for U.S. troops to continue to remain in South Korea.

The statement said: "The governments of the two countries firmly demand that the aggressive troops of U.S. imperialism, which are hindering the peaceful reunification of Korea and threatening peace in Asia, immediately withdraw from South Korea."

The statement said that the Hungarian Worker-Peasant Revolutionary Government supports the sincere efforts and demands made by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea to realize the repatriation of Korean residents in Japan, and believes that this issue must be resolved immediately. "Both sides firmly protest the Syngman Rhee clique's conspiracy to sell the people of South Korea as slaves to South American countries."

The statement said that the Korean Workers' Party and the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party believe that it is their primary task to make every effort to safeguard the purity of Marxism-Leninism, consolidate the unity of the communist parties and workers' parties of all countries, and wage an irreconcilable struggle against the Yugoslav revisionists and other revisionist elements who attempt to undermine the unity of the international communist movement and weaken the world's peace-loving forces.

The statement said: The representatives of the two parties are satisfied to point out that the ties between the two parties are growing stronger, and the delegations of the two parties exchanged experiences in socialist construction during this meeting. The representatives of the two parties highly appraised each other's correct policies implemented by the two parties in socialist construction and the brilliant achievements made by the people of the two countries.

The statement said that both sides were satisfied to point out that the political, economic, and cultural ties between Korea and Hungary are developing. Both sides emphasized the need to further develop economic cooperation between the two countries. Both sides believe that this visit to Korea by the Hungarian Party and government delegation has made a significant contribution to the development of friendly cooperation between the two countries and to the consolidation of the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union.
