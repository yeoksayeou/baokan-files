The sun shines on the Lhasa plain, sweeping away thousands of years of dark clouds. We have overthrown the mountains on our heads and crushed the chains around our necks. Wonderful! My hometown, glorious! This year's spring! My one million two hundred thousand compatriots have shed their worries and put on smiles. The giant hands of the Tibetan and Han nationalities are building a democratic and happy plateau. Look! The highland barley is full in the barns, and cattle and sheep cover the mountains! Listen! The magnificent songs shake the snow-capped mountains and glaciers.

    我心中的歌
    多吉才仁太阳照着拉萨平原，千年乌云一齐冲散。推倒了头上的大山，碾碎了颈上的锁链。好呀！我的家乡，光荣呀！今年的春天！我的同胞一百二十万，愁眉尽消，挂上了笑颜。藏汉两个民族的巨手，正在建设民主和幸福的高原。看！青稞盈仓，牛羊遍山，听！雄壮的歌震动着雪山冰川。
