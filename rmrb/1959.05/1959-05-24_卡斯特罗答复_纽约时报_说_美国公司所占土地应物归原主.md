Xinhua News Agency, Havana, May 22nd: Cuban Prime Minister Castro today gave a televised speech in response to an editorial in the American "New York Times" on May 21st regarding Cuban land reform. Castro said that he has no intention of revising the land reform law, despite the opposition of those affected to the land reform law and other revolutionary laws.

Castro said that if a law were enacted that preserved the large estate system intact, then it could not be considered a law at all. Castro emphasized that the 50,000 caballerias of land occupied by five American companies in Cuba should be returned to Cuba. He said that these companies have nothing to do with the American people, and since the land they occupy is in Cuba, it should belong to Cuba.

Referring to the recent announcement by the Guatemalan government that six ships carrying weapons had left Cuba to invade Guatemala, Castro said that this was an international conspiracy. He believes that the above conspiracy may be related to Cuba's land reform. This may be the first step in some kind of conspiracy against Cuba, a plan to pave the way for future activities.

In his speech, Castro also mentioned that a Cuban economic delegation headed by Che Guevara, one of the leaders of the Cuban armed forces, will visit the United Arab Republic and other countries to improve trade relations.

Castro said that Cuba's revolution is not red, but olive green. Cuba's revolution is neither capitalist nor communist, neither to the right nor to the left.

    卡斯特罗答复“纽约时报”说
    美国公司所占土地应物归原主
    新华社哈瓦那22日电　古巴总理卡斯特罗今天就美国“纽约时报”21日关于古巴土地改革的社论发表了电视演说，卡斯特罗说，我丝毫不想修改土地改革法，尽管受到影响的那部分人反对土地改革法和其它革命法律。
    卡斯特罗说，如果制定一项原封不动地保留大庄园制度的法律，那就不能算制订了任何法律。卡斯特罗强调指出，五个美国公司在古巴占有的五万卡瓦耶里亚土地应该还给古巴。他说，这些公司与美国人民毫无关系，它们占有的土地既然在古巴，就应该归古巴所有。
    卡斯特罗在谈到危地马拉政府最近宣称有所谓六艘带有武器的船离开古巴去侵略危地马拉的消息时，他说这是一个国际阴谋。他认为，上述阴谋和古巴的土地改革可能有关系。这或许是某种反对古巴的阴谋意图的第一步，是一个为今后的活动开辟道路的计划。
    卡斯特罗在演说中还谈到，以古巴武装部队领袖之一格瓦拉为首的古巴经济代表团将访问阿联和其它国家，以便改善贸易关系。
    卡斯特罗说，古巴的革命不是红色的，而是橄榄绿色。古巴的革命既不是资本主义的，也不是共产主义的，既不向右，也不向左。
