　　Spring in Lhasa doesn't often see rain; and when it does, it's no mere passing shower. The comrades responsible for issuing agricultural loans overlooked this fact, and most of them left without rain gear.
　　Despite the continuous drizzle, they still had to distribute seeds village by village, as this was the prime time for planting!
　　By the time the agricultural loan team arrived at Duilong Xika (village name), it was already getting dark. The entire plateau seemed covered by a giant black pot, and everyone stayed at Aunt Caili Lamu's house. Over the years, the agricultural loan team comrades had always stayed with her. In the Lhasa offices and troops, Aunt Caili Lamu had made the acquaintance of over a dozen people who were like her own sons.
　　After dinner, the comrades chatted and laughed, discussing the grain seed distribution for the next day. Everyone said that this year's increase in the amount would be enough for all households lacking seeds. Team leader Lü Yu didn't actively participate in the discussion; he had a headache and felt dizzy. Waves of confusion washed over him, and he felt chills all over his body. He'd caught a cold from the rain.
　　The rain kept falling. While the comrades were eating, Caili Lamu had already started cooking radish soup. According to her experience, someone who had been chilled by the wind and rain would feel better after drinking two bowls of radish soup. At this time, she didn't know that Lü Yu was sick; she was just following the usual practice of making everyone drink her radish soup after they settled in, otherwise she wouldn't help them with any other problems.
　　Caili Lamu quietly carried the iron pot into the room. The scene before her startled her. Everyone was gathered around Lü Yu, sighing. She suddenly remembered Lü Yu's listless appearance earlier; he must have caught a cold. She took the radish soup back to the kitchen.
　　Caili Lamu grabbed a tattered sheepskin cloak and threw it over herself, took off her boots, and waded out into the rain. Gusts of light wind carried dense rain, bringing a piercing chill. Caili Lamu shivered several times, and in a moment, she arrived at the radish cellar. She felt around in the slippery mud and pulled out a large piece of ginger.
　　After returning to the kitchen, she found a few eggs. Caili Lamu thought, "Drinking just spicy soup won't be good for his throat! Mixing in a few eggs will lessen the spiciness of the ginger soup."
　　Lü Yu tried his best to endure, although he felt like his head was as big as a small mountain, he tried not to groan. He struggled to speak, "Everyone should go to sleep, what's the point of staying up? I feel much better!"
　　But he couldn't hide it from the doctor:
　　"Your fever is still rising, I'll stay with you for a while; everyone else should go to rest!" But no one went to sleep. Just then, the comrades heard someone panting heavily behind them. They turned around and saw Caili Lamu holding a large wooden bowl of egg and ginger soup in both hands. Everyone quickly took the bowl, and some busied themselves wiping the raindrops from her face.
　　"Ama la (Tibetan for 'mother'), quickly put on your boots, or you'll catch a cold too," Lü Yu said with tears in his eyes.
　　"I'll put them on as soon as you drink this."
　　Lü Yu didn't carefully taste the ginger soup, and swallowed the whole eggs after just a few chews; he felt a warmth of love and friendship spread throughout his body along with the ginger soup. After a while, probably because the ginger soup took effect, he started sweating, and Lü Yu really did feel much better.
　　Before everyone lay down to sleep, Caili Lamu brought out the radish soup again. If anyone refused to drink it, they couldn't think about sleeping....

　　雨夜

    拉萨的春天，是不常下雨的；要是下起来的话，却不是一般一掠而过的小雨。发放农业贷款的同志们，对这点有些疏忽，大多数人出门没有带雨具。
    虽然是阴雨连绵，还是要一村一村地去发放种籽，这正是下种的好机会啊！
    农贷组来到堆隆西卡（村名）时，天色已经暗下来。整个高原，像是扣上了一口大黑锅，大家都在采力拉姆大娘的家里住了下来。这些年来，农贷组的同志总是住在她家里。在拉萨的机关部队里，采力拉姆大娘已经结识了十几个像亲儿子一样的亲人。
    同志们吃饭以后，有说有笑的谈论明天发放粮种的事。大家都说今年增加这么大的数字，够所有缺种户用了。小组长吕煜并没有积极参加这次谈论，他有些头昏脑胀。眼前一阵阵昏乱，身上一阵阵发冷，被雨淋了，感冒啦。
    雨，不停地下着。采力拉姆趁同志们吃饭的时候，就已经熬起萝卜汤来。按照她的经验，经过雨打风吹受了凉的人，喝两碗萝卜汤就会好的。这时，她并不知道吕煜害病的事，只是按照惯例，当同志们住下后，必需喝她的萝卜汤，不然的话，她就不给同志们解决其他问题。
    采力拉姆悄悄地端着铁锅跨进了屋门。眼前的情景使她惊愕起来。大家都围在吕煜旁边叹气。她忽然想起吕煜刚刚那副没精打采的样子，一定是感冒了。她又把萝卜汤端回灶房去。
    采力拉姆顺手抓起一件破羊皮披在身上，脱掉靴子，淌着水往门外走去。股股轻风裹来阵阵密雨，带来了袭人的寒气。采力拉姆连打了几个寒噤，转眼来到了萝卜窟的旁边。她在湿滑的泥土里，摸出了一大块生姜。
    回到灶房以后，又找到了几个鸡蛋，采力拉姆想：“光是喝辣汤，嗓子可不好受啊！有几个鸡蛋搅混着，就会减轻姜汤的辣味。”
    吕煜尽力忍耐着，虽然他感到脑袋简直像小山那么大，但他尽力不哼出声来。他挣了挣劲说：“大家都睡吧，白熬着干什么，我觉着轻松多了！”
    但他是瞒不住医生的：
    “你的热度还在增加，我再陪你一会；别的人休息去吧！”但谁也没去睡。正在这时，同志们听到有人呼吃呼吃在后面喘气，回头一看，采力拉姆双手捧着个盛着鸡蛋姜汤的大木碗，大家赶快把碗接过来，有的又忙着替她擦脸上的水珠。
    “阿妈啦（藏语‘妈妈’），你快把靴子穿上，不然也会受凉的。”吕煜含着泪珠说。
    “等你喝下去，我立刻去穿上靴子。”
    吕煜没有仔细品尝姜汤是什么味道，连整个的鸡蛋也只嚼了几下就咽下去了；他感到一股爱抚和友谊的温暖随着这姜汤传遍了全身。一会，大概是姜汤见了效，汗发出来了，吕煜也确实觉得轻松多了。
    大家还没有躺下的时候，采力拉姆又端来了萝卜汤，谁要不喝，就莫想睡觉……。
