Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, May 25th: According to foreign news agency reports cited by the Vietnam News Agency today, Lao Kingdom troops launched an attack on former Pathet Lao fighting units stationed in the Plain of Jars on May 23rd.

The report said that a Kingdom troops spokesperson revealed that the former Pathet Lao fighting units were forced to retaliate in self-defense, and fighting broke out between the two sides.

It was previously reported that the Sananikone government, disregarding the agreement reached between the Lao Kingdom side and the former Pathet Lao fighting units side in 1957 regarding the former Pathet Lao fighting units' participation in national common life, dispatched a large number of troops to surround the former Pathet Lao fighting units and cut off their supply lines, attempting to force them to disarm.

Vietnam News Agency said that observers in Hanoi believe that the Phoui Sananikone government must bear full responsibility for the consequences of their actions.
