Building Large Dams on the Banks of the Yellow River to Forever Overcome Flood and Drought Disasters
Representative Li Chengzhi Discusses the Achievements of Shandong's Water Conservancy Construction
I fully agree with and support Premier Zhou Enlai's Government Work Report and the reports of Vice Premiers Li Fuchun, Li Xiannian, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen. I resolutely support all the central government's measures to quell the rebellion in Tibet and firmly oppose the imperialists and Indian expansionists' instigation of the Tibetan rebellion and their support for the traitorous Tibetan group's criminal activities of splitting China.

I will now report to the congress on the situation of water conservancy construction in Shandong in 1958.

Like the rest of the country, our province, under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and the correct leadership of the Shandong Provincial Party Committee of the CPC, has achieved great accomplishments in all aspects of the political and ideological front and socialist construction. Along with the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production, a high tide of the whole Party and the entire people vigorously running people's communes was rapidly set off, and in a short period of time last autumn, the people's communization was realized in the rural areas of the entire province.

In 1958, Shandong's water conservancy construction, under the brilliant illumination of the general line, and due to the Provincial Party Committee's resolute implementation of the central government's "three main" water management policy and vigorous mass movement, thoroughly opposed various right-leaning conservative ideas, thus ushering in a great leap forward in water conservancy construction, achieving great accomplishments in one year surpassing those of several thousand years. Various engineering measures were established like stars scattered across the sky, and the irrigated area increased sixteen times compared to before liberation, which laid a favorable foundation for realizing water conservancy throughout the province, moving towards a higher stage, and for "fundamentally changing Shandong's natural features and completely eliminating flood and drought disasters."

Water conservancy is the lifeline of agriculture. Our Shandong is at the lower reaches of the Yellow River, with insufficient surface water, less rainfall, and the characteristics of spring drought and autumn floods, with abundant rainfall during the flood season. Drought and flood disasters pose a great threat to agricultural production every year. Therefore, solving the water conservancy problem, overcoming drought and flood disasters, fully utilizing various water sources, and ensuring agricultural harvests are very pressing issues in our province at present. Before liberation, the water conservancy foundation in our province was extremely weak, with only 3.38 million mu of irrigated land, accounting for 2.4 percent of the total cultivated land. After liberation, under the correct leadership of the Party and the government, water conservancy construction work began. After cooperativization, water conservancy construction experienced a new development, and by the end of 1957, the irrigated area in the province had developed to 30 million mu, accounting for 23 percent of the total cultivated land.

"With a pair of hands, leading the high mountains by the nose; with a pair of shoulders, standing tall carrying Yimeng Mountain."

In 1958, under the brilliant illumination of the Party's general line for socialist construction, and under the requirements of the great leap forward in industry and agriculture, the whole Party and the entire people of Shandong launched a water conservancy construction high tide with a larger scale, broader content, stronger momentum, faster speed, and higher quality. In the past year, in vigorously carrying out mass agricultural farmland water conservancy basic construction and soil and water conservation in mountainous areas, the people of the entire province, under the fighting call of "taking advantage of the momentum to advance at full speed, working hard for three years, and changing the face of Shandong" put forward by the Provincial Party Committee, brought into play boundless wisdom and strength. During the movement, the number of people dispatched every day reached more than 10 million. From mountainous areas to plains, from hills to rivers, everywhere could be heard the songs of labor. With the determination and perseverance of "making high mountains bow their heads, rivers give way, and land turn over" to tame nature, they waged a tenacious struggle against nature day and night, overcame various difficulties, and created unprecedented great miracles. For example, the people of Boshan County, with the spirit of the Foolish Old Man Who Moved Mountains, opened mountains and split ridges, moved rivers and changed courses, and led water up the mountains. On cliffs 180 meters above the ground, crossing more than 90 mountain tops, they diverted the Zi River water to the 400-meter-high mountain top, building the 122-li-long Taming the Zi River Project, which can irrigate tens of thousands of mu of farmland and solve the drinking water for more than 40 villages and two mining areas. In the water conservancy great leap forward in the original Heze area, a million-strong labor force worked hard for 20 days, and all the cultivated land basically realized large-field terracing. Another example is the Youth Mountain Control Team of Xiawei Township, Yishui County, which, in order to overcome poor mountains and bad waters and ensure a great agricultural harvest, camped on the spot in deep mountains and wild depressions, persisted through a winter, and opened mountains and split ridges day and night. They sang heroically, "Calling high mountains to bow their heads, calling floods to give way," "Just relying on these hands, leading the high mountains by the nose; just relying on these shoulders, standing tall carrying Yimeng Mountain; when the sun sees it, it is afraid, inviting the moon to change night shifts." Thanks to the heroic labor of the broad masses, tremendous achievements have been made in farmland water conservancy construction and mountainous area construction. In the past year, a total of more than 300,000 storage projects such as ponds and dams and reservoirs, more than 110,000 water diversion projects, more than 1 million wells, 52 million mu of large-field terraces, and 15 million mu of flood control areas have been completed, with a total of 13 billion cubic meters of earthwork and stonework completed. The farmland irrigation area has increased to 85.56 million mu, accounting for more than 70 percent of the province's cultivated land area. The increase in irrigation area in one year is equal to sixteen times the original irrigation area of 3.38 million mu before liberation. Last winter, another second water conservancy construction high tide, focusing on drilling mechanized wells, storing water and conserving water, extensively repairing field projects, and fully utilizing benefits, was launched throughout the province. Since the Provincial Party Committee convened a field work conference in mountainous areas in Yishui County last March, the work of soil and water conservation in mountainous areas has entered a new stage of comprehensive development. More than 1 million people throughout the province have participated in mountain management every day. After a year of hard work, the area controlling soil erosion has reached 28,200 square kilometers, which is equivalent to 12.1 times the area controlling soil erosion of 2,500 square kilometers before 1958.

Fundamental River Control Enters a New Stage of Basin-Wide Comprehensive Management; Taming the Yellow River Embarks on a Strategic Turning Point of Water Diversion for Beneficial Purposes

In the past year, in terms of large- and medium-sized water conservancy project construction, in 1958, our province held a total of 207 large- and medium-sized water conservancy basic construction projects with the North-South Grand Canal and the Yellow River as the backbone and the Weishan Hub on the Yellow River as the heart. This is another new symbol of the great leap forward in water conservancy construction in our province in 1958, and it is also a new stage in our province's fundamental river control entering a comprehensive management from local to basin-wide. In terms of developing and utilizing Yellow River resources, in 1958, a water conservancy construction high tide of marching towards the Yellow River was set off. This is a strategic turning point in the history of Yellow River management for thousands of years, from passive drainage defense to water diversion for beneficial purposes. In the past, although some siphon projects were carried out along the Yellow River, large-scale construction of dike-breaking and gate-building water diversion and irrigation projects only began last year. Such as the Weishan Hub, Dongping Lake Reservoir, and the Yellow River diversion gates of Liuzhuang, Liulou, Luokou, Mazhazi, and Hanjiadun. The construction of these projects is a major event for our province. The Weishan Hub Project is an important part of the comprehensive plan of the Party and the state to eradicate Yellow River water disasters and develop Yellow River water conservancy; it is the central hub of our province's water conservancy network. The entire project includes three major parts: the Weishan Hub, the Dongping Lake Reservoir, and the main water conveyance canal. The Weishan Hub includes more than 40 main buildings such as a dam, intake gate, flood intake gate, control gate, diversion gate, and ship lock. The large Dongping Lake Reservoir project has a water storage area of 628 square kilometers and a water storage capacity of 3 billion cubic meters, playing a huge role in regulating the Yellow River's major floods and preventing ice floods, adjusting north-south navigation, storing water for irrigation, power generation, and aquaculture. Comprehensive management of other major rivers has also been carried out on a basin-wide basis. In addition, 112 large- and medium-sized reservoirs with a water storage capacity of more than 10 million cubic meters, which started construction in 1958, have been completed by the end of the year, with 26 large- and medium-sized reservoirs completed and 1.08 billion cubic meters of water stored. For example, more than 300,000 troops in the former Heze area, after two months of hard struggle, built a large plain reservoir—the Taihangdi Reservoir, which is more than 150 li long and more than 10 li wide, covering an area of about 370,000 mu. It can divert Yellow River floodwaters of more than 1 billion cubic meters and irrigate more than 8 million mu of land, turning the southwestern plains of Shandong, which were once known for frequent droughts and floods, into a rich and beautiful land of fish and rice.

The great leap forward and the great achievements made in water conservancy construction in our province in 1958 are the result of the correct leadership and strong support of the central government; the result of the Shandong Provincial Party Committee of the CPC and the party committees at all levels resolutely implementing the Party's general line for socialist construction and the Party's "three main" water management policy; the result of the victory of the Party's mass rectification movement, the anti-Rightist struggle, and the opposition to localism, decentralism, and right-leaning opportunism; the result of the broad masses of people bringing into play revolutionary soaring spirit, hard struggle, selfless labor, breaking superstitions, liberating thought, and establishing a communist style of daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act; and also the result of learning from the water conservancy construction experience of fraternal provinces.

Due to the tremendous leap forward in water conservancy construction, the natural features of our province have been greatly changed, ordinary flood and drought disasters have been basically eliminated, and a great agricultural harvest has been ensured in 1958.

1958 was a year of uneven drought and flood in Shandong. From the time wheat was planted in September 1957 to the wheat harvest in June 1958, the province received only 170 mm of rainfall in ten months, which was nearly half less than the average rainfall for the same period. In the face of this once-in-fifty-year severe drought, the people of our province, under the leadership of the Party, carried out drought resistance struggles with the power to turn the tide, drilling wells to find springs, blocking rivers and building dams, opening mountains and splitting ridges to find water sources, and using various water conservancy facilities to irrigate more than 80 million mu. Huang County, which was the most severely affected by the drought, only received 181 mm of rainfall in a year, with the plain drying several feet deep and tens of thousands of wells drying up. Under the slogan of "Man can conquer nature, resolutely capture and destroy 'heavenly fire' to ensure a good harvest," the people of Huang County carried out a tenacious drought resistance struggle. Their mechanized well teams wanted to "drill through the earth," and some wells were deepened by dozens of meters, even more than 100 meters. The severe drought was finally overcome. After the autumn, drought went and floods came, and some areas had heavy rainfall. In the Wen-Si River basin and parts of Huxi, rainfall reached more than 800 mm in half a month. In Yixian County, the center of heavy rainfall, the daily rainfall reached 399 mm. However, due to the tremendous blocking and storage effects of farmland water conservancy projects blooming everywhere, no major flood disasters were caused despite the concentrated heavy rainfall. Our province's agricultural production achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest in this situation of imbalanced climate and uneven rainfall, and grain, cotton, and oil more than doubled compared to 1957. Obviously, this is the result of fully implementing the "Eight-Character Constitution" for agriculture, and it is also inseparable from water conservancy construction.

In 1958, the Yellow River in our province experienced an extraordinary flood, and the flood peak exceeded the guaranteed water level by 1.09 meters. The flood was only a few inches away from the top of the dike, putting our province's thousand-mile Yellow River dike to a severe test. Under the call of "Ensuring the safety of the Yellow River and ensuring a good harvest" put forward by the Provincial Party Committee, and with the strong support of the central government and fraternal provinces and cities, the people along the river fought for several days and nights and built a sub-dike one or two meters high on the thousand-mile Yellow River dike, enabling the Yellow River to safely pass the dangerous flood season. This created an unprecedented miracle in the history of Yellow River flood control that extraordinary floods did not breach the dike or divert the flood. When we look back at 1933, when the same type of flood occurred, the Yellow River flood breached the dike and flooded before it reached Shandong, inundating large areas in the five provinces of Henan, Hebei, Shandong, Anhui, and Jiangsu. On the Shandong border, Fan County and Shouzhang were flooded on the north bank, and Heze, Juye, and six or seven other counties were flooded on the south bank. The Yellow River water rushed into Weishan Lake and broke into Nanyang Lake, causing a serious flood disaster. However, today's Yellow River not only does not flood and cause disasters, but is benefiting us. Our province's siphon irrigation has spread to both banks, and most of the large- and medium-sized Yellow River diversion culverts have been initially built and have already been irrigating, and a large east-west canal in central Shandong, irrigating tens of millions of mu of fertile plains, will soon be formed, with north-south water diversion. Last year, when the Weishan Yellow River diversion gate released water, the peasants saw the rolling Yellow River water flow tamely into the northwest Shandong plain, and they happily said: "The people along the river smile, the rolling Yellow River water flows out of the river, building large dams on the banks of the Yellow River, forever overcoming flood and drought disasters." The Yellow River water flowed into the large Dongping Lake Reservoir, and from this year onwards, it has also undertaken a new task—starting to irrigate the land of Liangshan and other places. The Taihangdi Reservoir in Caoxian County stores Yellow River water diverted from Henan Province. Last year, it irrigated the fertile plains of southwest Shandong, and several counties around the reservoir are starting to build "eight-integration" water conservancy projects (eight-integration means: irrigation self-flow, plain river network, cultivated land gardenization, water conservancy electrification, well mechanization everywhere, water and land transportation, diversified aquaculture, and large-scale landscaping), combined with the construction of the main and branch canals of the Liuzhuang Yellow River diversion gate, to use the Yellow River's "heavenly water" to transform the disaster-prone area in history in southwest Shandong into Shandong's "Land of Abundance." On both banks of the Weiyun River in northwest Shandong, several irrigation projects have been built, and the water diverted from the Yellow River to benefit the Weiyun is also nourishing the land in the Liaocheng area. After the completion of the Sinvsi Hydropower Station, it has also sent us hydroelectric light, contributing new strength to socialist construction.

Store the water from the sky, use the water from the ground, comprehensively develop, comprehensively utilize, and fully utilize the effectiveness of water conservancy.

The tremendous achievements in water conservancy construction in the past year have not only basically eliminated ordinary flood and drought disasters and ensured a comprehensive and unprecedented bumper harvest in agricultural production in 1958, but also strengthened the people's belief in "man can conquer nature" and created an ideological and material foundation for completely realizing water conservancy, thoroughly eliminating natural disasters, and fundamentally changing Shandong's natural features.

Although our province has made great achievements in water conservancy construction in 1958, it is still far from fully realizing water conservancy and fully meeting the needs of agricultural production. The existing water conservancy projects cannot achieve the requirements of "completely eliminating drought and flood disasters and comprehensively utilizing water resources." Therefore, the Shandong Provincial Party Committee of the CPC and the Provincial People's Committee made a plan to realize water conservancy last winter. It requires that soil and water conservation and water storage and irrigation projects in all mountainous areas be fully realized in the next few years and developed to a high standard, reaching "no mountain is not green, and all water is clear"; the plains will realize river networkization, gardenization, well mechanization, and irrigation and water lifting mechanization, fully utilize various water conservancy resources, realize comprehensive water conservancy, and reach the standard of "heavy rain will not cause disasters, and no rain will ensure a good harvest." And vigorously carry out hydropower generation, and strive to accelerate the realization of electrification throughout the province. With the Yellow River and the North-South Grand Canal as the water conservancy backbone, and the Weishan Hub as the center, more than 30 first-, second-, and third-level river network projects that can be navigated will be built across the province, with a total length of more than 3,000 kilometers, so that rivers are connected to each other, and reservoirs are connected to each other. Store the water from the sky, use the water from the river, and dig out the water from the ground. Comprehensively develop, comprehensively utilize storage, irrigation, drainage, navigation, power generation, and aquaculture, and gradually build a complete water conservancy project system to fully utilize the maximum effectiveness of water conservancy projects and water resources. In the near future, after the realization of this plan, a new look will appear everywhere in our province: "Channels crisscross, flowing water gurgles; hydropower stations stand in rows, mountains and slopes are green; river channels and slopes are like terraces, water lifting machines roar; gullies and river terraces are all reservoirs, and fish play with lotus roots in the reservoirs; square cultivated land is gardenized, and the project system is built completely."

Dear representatives! Under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and on the basis of the victory of the great leap forward in 1958, the people of Shandong are full of confidence, full of energy, striving for excellence, and making persistent efforts to struggle for a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in 1959.

　　黄河岸上做大闸永远战胜水旱灾
    李澄之代表谈山东水利建设的成就
    我完全同意和拥护周恩来总理的政府工作报告和李富春副总理、李先念副总理和彭真副委员长的各项报告。我坚决拥护中央平定西藏叛乱的一切措施，坚决反对帝国主义和印度扩张主义分子策动西藏叛乱、支持西藏叛国集团分裂中国的罪恶活动。
    我把山东一九五八年水利建设情况向大会作一汇报。
    我省和全国一样，在党中央和毛主席的英明领导下，在中共山东省委的正确领导下，不论在政治思想战线上和社会主义建设各个方面都取得了伟大的成就。随着工农业生产的大跃进，迅速地掀起了一个全党全民大办人民公社的高潮，仅仅在去秋短短的时间内，在全省农村中就实现了人民公社化。
    一九五八年我省的水利建设，在总路线的光辉照耀下，由于省委坚决贯彻了中央的“三主”治水方针和大搞群众运动，彻底地反对了各种右倾保守思想，因而出现了水利建设的大跃进，取得了一年胜过几千年的伟大成就。各项工程措施星罗棋布的建立起来，灌溉面积比解放前增加了十六倍，这就为实现全省水利化，向更高阶段迈进，为“根本改变山东自然面貌，彻底消灭水旱灾害”打下了有利基础。
    水利是农业的命脉。我们山东在黄河的最下游，地上水不足，雨量较少，又有春旱秋涝，汛期雨多的特点。旱涝灾害年年对农业生产威胁很大，因而解决水利问题，战胜旱涝灾害，充分利用各种水源，保证农业的丰收，是我省在当前一个很迫切的问题。解放以前，我省的水利基础是极其薄弱的，全省仅有灌溉面积三百三十八万亩，占总耕地面积的百分之二点四。解放以后，在党和政府的正确领导下，开始了兴修水利的建设工作。合作化以后，水利建设又有了一个新的发展，到一九五七年底，全省灌溉面积已发展到三千万亩，占总耕地面积的百分之二十三。
    “凭着一双手，牵着高山鼻子走；凭着一双肩，挺腰担起沂蒙山”
    一九五八年在党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，在工农业大跃进形势的要求下，山东全党全民掀起了一个规模更大、内容更广、劲头更足、速度更快、质量更高的水利建设高潮。一年来在大搞群众性的农田水利基本建设和山区的水土保持方面，全省人民在省委提出的“乘破竹之势，兼程前进，苦战三年，改变山东面貌”的战斗号召下，发挥了无穷的智慧和力量。在运动中每天出动人数达一千多万人，无论从山区到平原，从丘陵到河川，到处可以听到劳动的歌声，他们以“让高山低头、河水让路、土地翻身”驯服自然的决心和毅力，夜以继日地向大自然进行了顽强的斗争，克服了种种困难，创造了史无前例的伟大奇迹。例如，博山县人民以愚公移山的精神，开山劈岭，移河改道，引水上山，在距地面一百八十公尺的悬崖陡壁上，越过九十多个山头，把淄河水引到四百公尺高的山顶上，修建了全长一百二十二华里的驯淄工程，可灌农田十几万亩，解决四十多个村庄和两个矿区的饮水。原菏泽专区在水利大跃进中，百万劳动大军，苦战了二十天，全部耕地基本上实现了大地畦田化。又如沂水县夏蔚乡青年治山队，为战胜穷山恶水，保证农业大丰收，他们在深山野洼里就地宿营，坚持了一个冬天，不分昼夜的开山劈岭，他们豪迈的唱着“叫高山低头，叫洪水让路”，“就凭这双手，牵着高山鼻子走；就凭这双肩，挺腰担起沂蒙山；太阳一见害了怕，请来月亮换夜班”。由于广大群众的英勇劳动，因而在农田水利建设和山区建设方面，取得了巨大的成就，一年来共完成塘坝、水库等蓄水工程三十余万座，引水工程十一万余处，打井百余万眼，大地畦田五千二百万亩，治涝面积一千五百万亩，共完成土石方一百三十亿公方，农田灌溉面积增加到八千五百五十六万亩，占全省耕地面积百分之七十以上，一年增加的灌溉面积等于解放前原有灌溉面积三百三十八万亩的十六倍，去年冬季，紧接着在全省范围内又开展了一个以打机井、蓄水保水、广泛兴修田间工程，充分发挥效益为主要内容的第二个水利建设高潮。山区的水土保持工作，自从去年三月，省委在沂水县召开了山区工作现场会议以后，水土保持工作随之进入了一个全面发展的新阶段，全省每日参加治山的达一百多万人，经过一年的苦战，控制水土流失面积二万八千二百平方公里，相当于一九五八年前控制水土流失面积二千五百平方公里的十二点一倍。
    根治河流进入流域性的综合治理新阶段；驯服黄河走上引水兴利的战略性转折点
    一年来在大、中型水利工程建设方面，一九五八年我省举办了以南北大运河和黄河为骨干，以黄河位山枢纽为心脏的大、中型水利基本建设工程共二百零七项。这是我省一九五八年水利建设大跃进的又一新标志，也是我省根治河流进入了一个由局部到流域性全面综合治理的新阶段。在开发利用黄河资源方面，一九五八年掀起了向黄河进军的水利建设高潮，这是几千年来在治黄史上由消极的排水防御转入引水兴利的一个战略性的转折点。过去虽然在沿黄作了一些虹吸工程，但是，从去年才大规模开始了破堤建闸引黄灌溉工程。如位山枢纽、东平湖水库和刘庄、刘楼、洛口、马札子、韩家墩等引黄闸，这些工程的兴建，对我省来说是一件大事情。位山枢纽工程，是党和国家根除黄河水害开发黄河水利综合规划中的重要组成部分；是我省水利网的中心枢纽。整个工程包括位山枢纽、东平湖水库、输水总干渠三大部分。其中位山枢纽包括拦河坝、进水闸、进洪闸、节制闸、分水闸、船闸等四十余个主要建筑物。大东平湖水库工程蓄水面积达到六百二十八平方公里，蓄水三十亿立方，起着调节黄河特大洪水及防止凌汛，调济南北航运，蓄水灌溉，发电和养殖等巨大作用。对其他几条主要河流也进行了流域性综合治理。此外，一九五八年度动工兴建的蓄水在一千万公方以上的大中型水库一百一十二座，到年底已完成大、中型水库二十六座，已蓄水十点八亿公方。如原菏泽专区三十多万大军经过两个月的艰苦奋斗，建立了一座大型的平原水库——太行堤水库，长达一百五十多华里，宽十余华里，占地面积约三十七万余亩，可引黄蓄洪十亿余公方，灌溉土地八百余万亩，把过去被人称为旱涝多灾的鲁西南大平原变为富饶美丽的鱼米之乡。
    一九五八年我省水利建设上所出现的大跃进和取得伟大的成就，是中央的正确领导和大力支援的结果；是中共山东省委和各级党委坚决地贯彻执行了党的社会主义建设总路线和党的“三主”治水方针的结果；是党的全民性的整风运动，反右派斗争，和反对地方主义、分散主义、右倾机会主义所取得的胜利的结果；是广大群众发挥了革命的冲天干劲、艰苦奋斗，忘我劳动、破除迷信，解放思想、树立了敢想敢说敢做的共产主义风格的结果；也是学习了兄弟省水利建设经验的结果。
    由于水利建设的巨大跃进，使我省的自然面貌大为改观，基本上解除了普通的水旱灾害，保证了一九五八年的农业大丰收。
    一九五八年山东是一个旱涝不均的年头。从一九五七年的九月开始种麦起到一九五八年的六月小麦收获止，十个月的时间全省只降雨一百七十公厘，比常年同期雨量减少将近一半。在这个五十年一遇的特大旱灾面前，我们全省人民在党的领导下，以回天之力进行了抗旱斗争，打井下泉、拦河打坝、开山劈岭寻找水源，利用了各种水利设施，抗旱浇地达八千多万亩。干旱最严重的黄县一年只降雨一百八十一公厘，平地下干几尺深，水井干了几万眼。黄县的群众在“人定胜天、坚决捕灭‘天火’保丰收”的口号下，进行了顽强的抗旱斗争。他们的机井队要“钻透地球”，把有的水井加深达几十公尺，甚至百多公尺。严重的干旱终于被战胜了。入秋以后，旱去涝来，部分地区又有暴雨，汶泗流域及湖西部分地区半月降雨达八百多公厘，暴雨中心的峄县，日雨量达三百九十九公厘。但是，由于遍地开花的农田水利工程起了巨大的拦蓄作用，尽管暴雨怎么集中，也没有造成多大涝灾。我省的农业生产就在这样气候失调雨量不匀的情况下取得了空前大丰收，粮、棉、油比一九五七年翻了一番多。很显然，这是全面贯彻执行农业“八字宪法”的结果，这也是和水利建设分不开的。
    一九五八年我省黄河出现了特大洪水，洪峰超过了保证水位一点零九公尺，洪水离堤顶仅有几公寸，使我省的千里黄河大堤面临着一次严重的考验。沿河人民在省委提出的“确保黄河安全，保证丰收”的号召下，在中央和兄弟省市的大力支援下，奋战几昼夜，在千里黄河大堤上筑起了一条一两公尺高的子埝，使黄河安全地渡过了危险的汛期，这在黄河防汛史上创造了特大洪水不决口、不分洪、史无前例的奇迹。当我们回顾发生同样类型洪水的一九三三年时，黄河的洪水却没到山东即决口泛滥成灾，淹没河南、河北、山东、安徽、江苏五省广大面积，山东境内北岸淹了范县和寿张，南岸淹了菏泽、巨野等六、七个县。黄河水冲入了微山湖，并又闯进了南阳湖，造成了严重的水灾。但是，今天的黄河不但没有泛滥成灾，反而正为我们谋福利。我省的虹吸灌溉已遍及两岸，大中型的引黄涵闸大部已经初步建成并已放水灌溉，很快即可形成以黄河为我省中部的东西大干渠，南北分水灌溉着几千万亩沃野平原。去年当位山引黄闸放水时，农民们看到滚滚的黄水驯服地流进了鲁西北大平原，他们高兴地说：“沿河人民笑颜开，滚滚黄水出河来，黄河岸上做大闸，永远战胜水旱灾”。黄河的水流进了大东平湖水库，从今年起也担负了新的任务——开始灌溉梁山等的土地。曹县太行堤水库里蓄存着从河南省引来的黄河水，去年即灌溉了鲁西南肥沃的平原，沿库周围的几个县正在着手兴建“八化一体”的水利工程（八化即：灌溉自流化、平原河网化、耕地园田化、水利电气化、遍地机井化、水陆交通化、水产多样化、大地园林化），结合刘庄引黄闸干支渠的修建，要利用黄河的“天上水”，把鲁西南这个历史上灾害频仍的地区变为山东的“天府之国”。在鲁西北的卫运河两岸上，已修建了若干灌溉工程，引黄济卫的水也滋润着聊城地区的土地，四女寺水电站建成后，它又给我们发出了水电之光，为建设社会主义贡献新的力量。
    把天上的水蓄起来，把地下的水用起来，全面开发，综合利用，充分发挥水利的效用
    一年来水利建设上的巨大成就，不仅基本上解除了普通水旱灾害，保证了一九五八年农业生产全面空前的大丰收，而且坚定了广大人民“人定胜天”的信念和为全部实现水利化彻底消灭自然灾害，根本改变山东自然面貌创造了思想和物质基础。
    一九五八年我省的水利建设事业，虽然取得了很大的成就，但是，距离全部实现水利化和完全满足农业生产的需要还相差很远。现有的水利工程还不能实现“彻底消灭旱涝灾害和综合利用水利资源”的要求。因此，中共山东省委和省人委去冬即作出了实现水利化的规划。要求在最近几年内全部实现山区的水土保持，和蓄水灌溉工程，并向高标准发展，达到“无山不绿，有水皆清”；平原实现河网化、园田化、机井化、灌溉提水机械化，充分利用各种水利资源，实现全面的水利化，达到“大雨不成灾，无雨保丰收”的标准。并大搞水利发电，力争加快实现全省电气化。以黄河和南北大运河为水利骨干，以位山枢纽为中心纵横全省兴建能通航的一二三级河网工程三十余条，长达三千多公里，做到河河相通，库库相连，把天上的水蓄起来，把河里的水用起来，把地下的水挖出来，蓄、灌、排、航、发电、养殖等全面开发，综合利用，逐步建成完整的水利工程系统，充分发挥水利工程和水利资源的最大效能。在不久的将来这个规划实现以后，我省将到处出现“渠道纵横，流水淙淙；水电站林立，山、坡青葱葱；河道坡地像阶梯，提水机械响隆隆；沟壑川台皆水库，库中游鱼戏莲菱；方方耕地园田化，工程系统建完整。”的新面貌。
    各位代表！我们山东人民在党中央和毛主席的英明领导下，在一九五八年大跃进的胜利基础上，满怀信心，鼓足干劲，力争上游，再接再厉，为实现一九五九年更大更好更全面的跃进而奋斗。
