Xinhua News Agency, 4th. Beijing: Multiple academic workers researching Asian and African issues in Beijing and other locations have recently initiated the establishment of the Chinese Asian-African Society. The first preparatory meeting was held in Beijing on April 30th.

In light of China's long-standing cultural and historical connections with various Asian and African countries, especially the growing friendly and cooperative relations between China and Asian and African countries since China's liberation, there is an urgent need to strengthen research into various aspects of Asian and African countries, such as society, politics, economy, history, philosophy, literature, and art, to enhance cultural exchange and mutual understanding between the people of China and Asian and African countries.

More than thirty scholars and experts currently researching Asian and African issues in Beijing attended this preparatory meeting. The meeting discussed the draft charter of the Chinese Asian-African Society and elected Guo Moruo, Zhou Yang, Bao Erhan, Chu Tunan, Wu Han, Zhang Tiesheng, and others to be responsible for the preparatory work.
