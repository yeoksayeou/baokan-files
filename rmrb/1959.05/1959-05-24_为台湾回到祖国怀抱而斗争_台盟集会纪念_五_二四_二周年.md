Xinhua News Agency, May 23rd: The headquarters of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League (TDSL) and its Beijing branch held a meeting this afternoon to commemorate the second anniversary of the patriotic anti-American demonstration by the people of Taiwan on "May 24th." Xu Mengshan, Secretary-General of the TDSL headquarters, reported on the intensified U.S. control over Taiwan and the anti-American struggle of the Taiwanese people over the past two years. Xu Mengshan said that the anti-American demonstration two years ago centrally demonstrated the Taiwanese people's deep-seated hatred for the American occupiers and their strong will to demand Taiwan's return to the embrace of the motherland. It showed that the U.S. Seventh Fleet could temporarily enter the Taiwan Strait, but it could not enter the hearts of the Taiwanese people. Over the past two years, the Taiwanese people have continued to wage struggles against the U.S. occupation of Taiwan. Although they have suffered violent suppression by the U.S., the surging anti-American undercurrent is growing. In the past two years, dozens of mass anti-American incidents have occurred, and U.S. invading personnel dare not go out alone in many places in Taiwan, indicating that the anti-American sentiment of the Taiwanese people is constantly growing.

Xu Mengshan emphasized that the struggle of the Taiwanese people is not isolated. The future of Taiwan is determined by the unwavering determination of the 650 million Chinese people to liberate Taiwan. The great leap forward in socialist construction in the motherland and the increasing strength of the socialist camp are very beneficial to the struggle to liberate Taiwan. The U.S. plot to create "two Chinas" and all attempts to permanently occupy Taiwan are bound to fail, and the U.S. aggressors must get out of Taiwan.

Tian Fuda (Gaoshan nationality) and Xie Nanguang, deputies to the National People's Congress, Yang Chunsong, Chen Wenbin, and Su Ziheng, members of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, and Chen Bingji, director of the Beijing branch of the TDSL, all Taiwanese natives living in Beijing, spoke at the meeting. They unanimously denounced the U.S. plot to create "two Chinas" and expressed deep longing for their elders, brothers, and sisters living in darkness and suffering in Taiwan. They hoped that the patriotic soldiers and civilians of Taiwan would unite under the banner of patriotism, be consistent in their foreign policy, resolutely oppose the U.S. creation of "two Chinas," and fight for Taiwan's early return to the embrace of the motherland.

    为台湾回到祖国怀抱而斗争
    台盟集会纪念“五·二四”二周年
    新华社23日讯　台湾民主自治同盟总部和北京市支部在今天下午举行集会，纪念台湾人民“五·二四”爱国反美大示威二周年。台盟总部秘书长徐萌山在会上报告了两年来美国加紧控制台湾和台湾人民反美斗争的情况。徐萌山说，两年前的反美大示威集中地表现了台湾人民对美国占领者仇恨入骨，要求台湾回到祖国怀抱的强烈意志。它表明美国第七舰队一时可以开进台湾海峡，但它不能开进台湾的人心。两年来台湾人民继续不断地进行着反对美国霸占台湾的斗争，虽然遭受到美国的暴力镇压，但汹涌澎湃的反美的暗流在增长着。两年来发生了几十次群众性的反美事件，美国侵略人员在台湾许多地方不敢单独外出，表明台湾人民的反美情绪正在不断增长。
    徐萌山强调指出，台湾人民的斗争不是孤立的。台湾的前途决定于六亿五千万中国人民一定要解放台湾这一不可摇撼的坚决意志。祖国社会主义建设大跃进和社会主义阵营的日益强大对解放台湾的斗争十分有利。美国制造“两个中国”和一切企图永久霸占台湾的阴谋一定失败，美国侵略者一定要滚出台湾。
    全国人民代表大会代表田富达（高山族）、谢南光，全国政协委员杨春松、陈文彬、苏子蘅和台盟北京市支部主任委员陈炳基等旅京台湾籍人士都在会上发言。他们一致痛斥美国制造“两个中国”的阴谋，并且对生活在黑暗苦难中的台湾父老兄弟姊妹表示深切的怀念。他们希望台湾的爱国军民同胞在爱国主义的旗帜下团结起来，一致对外，坚决反对美国制造“两个中国”，为台湾早日回到祖国怀抱而斗争。
