　　I Like Tagore's Country
　　Féng Xīn
    I like Tagore's works, and I also like Tagore's country.

    Whenever I read "Gitanjali" or "The Crescent Moon," my heart is immersed in the wonderful world described by the poet: the vast and noisy sea, the hot and rainy climate, the lush green coconut trees, betel nut trees, banana trees, jackfruit trees..., the fragrant jasmine, white lotus, golden flowers, and ḳadamba flowers..., women with earthen pots on their heads and scarves fluttering in the wind, innocent children playing happily by the sea, and that intoxicating music with a touch of sadness....

    This is India, ancient and beautiful India.

    In modern history, India suffered a brutal ravaging for three hundred and fifty years. From the establishment of the British East India Company in 1600, the Indian people lived a miserable life under the dark rule of British colonialism. Capitalists plundered and seized, draining their essence, and famine and death accompanied them. A British Governor-General, talking about the poverty situation in India at the time, had to admit: "The bones of Indian cotton weavers have bleached the land of the Indian plains." This is the self-confession of robbers. In the early and mid-nineteenth century, the Indian people rose up to resist British colonialism. The "Times" even issued a frantic shout, demanding to take the land of a hundred Hindu temples to compensate for a destroyed Christian church; to use the lives of a thousand insurgents to compensate for a killed European, without showing mercy even to women and children. Blood, the blood of the Indian people, flowed on this ancient and beautiful land.

    Tagore did not forget these things. He loved his country and his people. He sought a "free heaven" in the world. He called for lights and looked forward to dawn. He said: "I don't know whether the socialist idea of more rationally distributing wealth will ever be realized; if not, then God's arrangement is really too cruel, and man is truly an unfortunate creature." He used poetry to awaken his compatriots to cut off the shackles with the "sword that shines like flame and is as heavy as thunder," and to fight the dark rule without fear. Later, he visited the Soviet Union and enthusiastically praised it, saying, "No country in the world can compare with it." He condemned Japan's invasion of China and was concerned about the situation of the Chinese War of Resistance against Japan before his death. He was a poet, a thinker, and also a great warrior who fought for the cause of peace.

    It was precisely for independence and freedom, democracy and peace, that the heroic Indian people launched a surging tide of national liberation movement, fighting the British rulers one after another, and finally exchanged blood for a federal republic.

    I praise Tagore, and I also praise Tagore's compatriots who firmly oppose imperialism, cherish Sino-Indian friendship, and love peace!

　　我喜欢泰戈尔的国家
　　冯心
    我喜欢泰戈尔的作品，我也喜欢泰戈尔的国家。
    每当读“吉檀迦利”或“新月集”的时候，我的心便浸沉在诗人笔下的奇妙天地里：辽阔而喧闹的大海，炎热而多雨的气候，浓绿的椰子树、槟榔树、香蕉树、贾克果树……，馥郁的茉莉花、白莲花、金色花、劫丹波花……，头上顶着瓦罐、披巾在风中飘扬的妇女，在海边欢乐嬉戏着的天真无邪的儿童，还有那带着淡淡悲哀的醉人的音乐……。
    这就是印度，古老而美丽的印度。
    在近代历史上，印度遭受了为时三百五十年之久的残酷蹂躏。从公元1600年英国东印度公司成立，印度人民就在英国殖民主义者的黑暗统治下过着悲惨的生活。资本家巧取豪夺，榨干了他们的精髓，饥馑和死亡伴随着他们。一个英印总督谈到当时印度贫困情况，也不得不承认：“印度棉织工人的白骨，把印度平原的土地都漂白了。”这是强盗们不打自招的口供。十九世纪初叶和中叶，印度人民奋起抗击英国殖民主义者。“泰晤士报”竟发出疯狂的叫喊，要拿一百座印度教寺的土地，来抵偿一所被破坏的基督教会；要用一千个起义者的生命，来抵偿一个被打死的欧洲人，虽妇孺也决不怜惜。血，印度人民的血，在这块古老而美丽的土地上流着。
    泰戈尔没有忘掉这些。他热爱自己的祖国和人民。他在人间寻求着“自由的天国”。他呼唤着灯火，期待着黎明。他说：“我不知道那目的要更合理地分配财富的社会主义思想是否会有实现的一天；如果没有，那上天的安排实在未免太残忍了，而人也真是一种太不幸的生物。”他用诗句唤醒同胞用那“火焰般放光，雷霆般沉重”的巨剑斩断羁勒，没有畏惧地向黑暗统治进行斗争。后来，他到苏联访问，热情地称赞说“世界上没有一个国家能和它相比。”他谴责日本对中国的侵略，临逝世前还关怀着中国抗日战争的情况。他是诗人，思想家，也是一个为和平事业而奋斗的伟大战士。
    正是为了独立与自由，民主与和平，英勇的印度人民掀起了民族解放运动的怒潮，前仆后继地同英国统治者决斗着，终于用鲜血换来了一个联邦共和国。
    我赞美泰戈尔，我也赞美坚决反对帝国主义、珍视中印友谊、爱好和平的泰戈尔的同胞们！
