Fujian Specialties

    Sugarcane
    Fujian is a province rich in sugarcane. It is not only famous for producing large quantities of sugar, but also renowned as a high-yield sugarcane region in the country. In 1958, the year of the Great Leap Forward, the average unit yield of sugarcane across the province's 380,000 mu of land approached 10,000 jin. High-yield fields with a yield of 20,000 jin per mu were commonly seen in various areas, making it a national red flag for high-yield sugarcane. This year, over 400,000 mu of sugarcane are planted, and the average unit area is expected to reach 15,000 jin per mu.
    Originally, Fujian sugarcane varieties only included bamboo sugarcane (i.e., garden sugarcane) and field sugarcane. Later, improved varieties were introduced from Taiwan Province, as well as Java and the Philippines. In the year of liberation, the sugarcane area in the province was only over 85,000 mu, with a unit yield of just over 3,500 jin. In recent years, under the strong leadership and support of the Party and the government, and through the active efforts of the vast number of cadres and sugarcane farmers, the cultivated area has been expanding year by year. At the same time, due to the continuous technological innovation in cultivation by the vast number of sugarcane farmers, sugarcane production has increased rapidly. The Taisugar 134 fine variety, since its promotion in 1954, has reached about 65% of the province's cultivated area this year. Together with other fine varieties, the province has basically achieved the use of improved varieties this year.

    Subtropical Fruits
    Fujian has fruits suitable for growth in tropical and subtropical regions, such as citrus, lychee, longan (also known as dried longan), jackfruit, banana, and many others, which are praised as the "Land of Fruits." Now, citrus trees are in full bloom, and lychee and longan trees are laden with fruit. This year, longan and lychee have particularly abundant spikes and flowers, and the harvest scene is better than in previous years. This year, the total area of ​​various orchards in the province will expand to 1.6 million mu, and the total output is expected to exceed 4 million dan.
    These subtropical fruits have special flavors and are famous at home and abroad. Citrus fruits include Xuegan oranges, Luchu oranges, Fujian oranges, and honey oranges. Recently, San Yue (March) and Liu Yue (June) oranges, which mature in March and June respectively, have been discovered. They mature six to seven months earlier than ordinary citrus fruits, providing favorable conditions for the year-round supply of citrus fruits. Pomelos are most famous in the Pingshan and Wendan pomelo areas of Zhangzhou, which have thin skin, thick flesh, and plenty of juice, and are resistant to storage and easy to transport. Large quantities are transported to the South Pacific Islands every year. Longan and lychee have fleshy and delicious pulp, which can be eaten fresh or dried, and are extremely nutritious. Longan is also a valuable medicinal material. Loquat is the only fruit in early spring, with a sweet taste and crisp flesh, and the processed loquat paste also has medicinal effects. In addition, the abundant pineapple (commonly known as jackfruit), olives, Tianbao bananas from Longxi, etc., are all unique flavors and popular delicacies.

    Tea
    Fujian, a famous tea area in China, has now entered the busy season of spring tea picking and production. At present, 100,000 tea farmers across the province go to the tea mountains every day to pick spring tea. By the end of April, the commercial departments had purchased more than 28,000 dan of spring tea. This year, the province's tea production plan has increased by 70% compared with last year, with a total output of 320,000 dan.
    Fujian tea has many varieties and good quality. Black tea, green tea, white tea, oolong tea, etc. are all available, and Wuyi Rock Tea, Anxi Tieguanyin, Bailin Congou, and Zhengshan Xiaozhong Silver Needle are all world-renowned top-quality teas.
    Wuyi Rock Tea belongs to the oolong tea category and is produced in the scenic Wuyi Mountains in northern Fujian. The tea leaves are verdant in color, oily and shiny, and have a faint fragrance. Among them, Da Hong Pao, Tie Luohan, and Bai Jiguan are even rarer and more precious teas. Anxi Tieguanyin, known as red heart, green edge, and fragrant after seven infusions, is also a very precious oolong tea. The tea has a clear and high fragrance, a slightly astringent taste at the entrance, and is refreshing after drinking. It is mainly sold to Hong Kong, Macao and Southeast Asia and is popular among overseas Chinese. Silver Needle in white tea is one of the most valuable and top-quality teas. This tea is purely baked from the buds of big white tea, and the bud tips are white as silver. The water is light green in color and the taste is clear and refreshing. It is a precious gift. Fujian flower tea has the best quality in the country. It uses unfermented green tea as raw material and is processed with various fragrant flowers such as magnolia and jasmine. The product name is named after the name of the fragrant flower, such as jasmine tea, magnolia tea, pomelo flower tea, fruit flower tea and other dozens of kinds. This kind of flower tea combines the fragrance of tea and flowers, and has a unique style. The soaked water is clear and bright, fragrant and pleasant.

    Mountain Delicacies
    In the vast forest areas of northern Fujian, in addition to producing large quantities of timber and bamboo for construction, it also produces a large number of nationally famous shiitake mushrooms. Shiitake mushrooms have a delicious taste, a fresh and refreshing aroma, and contain nutrients such as protein, fat, cellulose, and vitamin D. Red mushrooms, which grow wild on the forest land on both sides of Shaxi (a tributary of the upper reaches of the Min River), are also a nutritious food.
    Fujian also produces precious tonic medicinal materials - white fungus, with Zhao'an County in southern Fujian being a famous producing area, producing tens of thousands of taels a year. White fungus is rich in sugars, proteins, etc., and can help the lungs, nourish blood, and aid digestion after consumption. The quality is the same as that of the nationally famous Sichuan white fungus.
    In the bamboo forests on both sides of Shaxi, Jianxi, and Futunxi in the upper reaches of the Min River, a large amount of dried bamboo shoots are produced. Among them, there is a precious dried bamboo shoot produced in winter, shaped like magnolia petals, and tastes very delicious, called yulanpian (magnolia slices). Fujian's mountain delicacies enjoy a high reputation at home and abroad. Overseas Chinese often have shiitake mushrooms and yulanpian from their motherland on their dining tables.

    Seafood
    Fujian is one of the major fishing areas in China. Fujian is rich in economic fish species, including large and small yellow croaker, hairtail, shark, cuttlefish, pomfret, eel, squid, snapper, as well as shrimp, swimming crab, sea cucumber, and dozens of other species. Among them, there are many extremely precious seafoods, such as the world's rare lancelet produced in Xiamen, Zhangzhou, and Quanzhou, with an annual output of about 400,000 jin, ranking first in the world. Lancelet has high nutritional value. It contains 70% protein, as well as a large amount of iodine and various inorganic salts. Lancelet is slightly transparent in color, two to three inches long, thin as a thread, with pointed head and tail, growing in the sand on the seashore. Its head organization is unclear, with no brain, no skull, and no spine, but with cartilage extending straight from the tail to the head. It is an animal that transitions from invertebrates to vertebrates. Therefore, it is not only a very good seafood food, but also an important physical material for studying the evolutionary history of organisms. Cuttlefish is also a good seafood, with the local cuttlefish produced in Xiamen Port being the best, sold to Shanghai, Guangzhou, Hong Kong and the South Pacific Islands. The sea clams produced in Fujian have delicious and crisp meat and are rare and nutritious precious aquatic products in the world. Fujian sea clam producing areas are mainly distributed in Zhanggang, Changle County, near the Min River estuary, so it is also known as Minjiang clam. In order to greatly develop sea clam production, an artificial sea clam breeding test farm has been established in Zhanggang this year, and experiments on artificial hatching of seedlings have begun. The farm plans to produce 500,000 jin of sea clams this year as a gift for the 10th anniversary of the National Day.
    Seahorse: It is a valuable medicine that can be used for fitness, kidney nourishment, and heart strengthening, especially for treating neurasthenia. The seahorse has a laterally flattened body, about eight to nine centimeters long, scaleless, and the head initially looks like a horse's head. The body color is brownish-black or yellow-green. The Dongfanghong People's Commune in Tongan established a seahorse breeding pool last year, stocking more than 10 million fry. This year, the county will appropriately expand the breeding pool and produce a large number of seahorses.
    Bamboo Clam: It looks similar to the artificially cultivated razor clam, but it is larger in size, generally ten to twenty centimeters long, and lives in the deep water bottom. It has not yet been artificially cultivated. Bamboo clams can be eaten fresh, but when processed into dried products, the color is light yellow and the taste is more delicious. It is produced in the Dinghai area of ​​Lianjiang.
    Sea Hare: It is a marine mollusk, and the excreted eggs are processed into seaweed powder. Few people eat the sea hare itself. Seaweed powder is cool in nature and has the function of pursuing heat and detoxification. It is mainly sold to inland mining areas. Eating seaweed powder can remove heat and coal gas poisoning, and is very effective in treating occupational diseases such as swelling of the eyeballs. Xiamen has a long history of artificial sea hare breeding and is the main producing area of ​​seaweed powder, with an annual output of about 10,000 jin.
    Red Crab: It is the noblest variety of crab and is widely welcomed by consumers at home and abroad. The red crab has fine and delicious meat. Last year, Xinglin Bay in Xiamen and Hongqi Commune in Jinjiang have begun breeding.

    福建特产
    甘蔗
    福建是一个盛产蔗糖的省份。它不但以出产大量的食糖闻名，而且它是国内一个素负盛名的甘蔗高产地区。1958年大跃进的一年，全省三十八万多亩甘蔗，平均单位产量接近万斤，各地普遍出现大面积亩产二万斤的丰产田，为全国甘蔗高产红旗。今年种植四十多万亩甘蔗，平均单位面积争取达到亩产一万五千斤。
    福建蔗种原只有竹蔗（即园蔗）、田蔗两种，后经由台湾省、以及爪哇、菲律宾等地输入改良种。在解放的那一年，全省甘蔗面积只有八万五千多亩，单位产量不过三千五百斤。几年来在党和政府的大力领导与支持下，经过广大干部、蔗农的积极努力，栽培面积逐年扩大，同时由于广大蔗农不断进行栽培技术革新，甘蔗生产量迅速上升。台糖134良种，自1954年推广以来，今年已达到全省栽培面积的65％左右，加上其他良种，全省今年基本实现了良种化。
    亚热带水果
    福建有适合在热带和亚热带生长的水果，如柑桔、荔枝、龙眼（又名桂元）、菠萝蜜、香蕉等多种，被人们誉称为“水果之乡”。现在，柑桔已经花开满园，荔枝、龙眼枝头结果累累。今年龙眼、荔枝抽穗开花特别繁茂，丰收景象胜过往年。全省今年各种果园面积将扩大到一百六十万亩，预计总产量将超过四百万担。
    这些亚热带水果具有特别风味，国内外著名。柑桔类中有雪柑、芦柑、福桔、蜜桔，最近又发现了在3月和6月成熟的三月柑、六月柑，比一般柑桔早熟六至七个月，为柑桔果品周年供应提供了有利条件。柚子以漳州地区的坪山和文旦柚子最出名，它皮薄、肉厚、汁多，又耐贮藏和便于装运，每年有大批运往南洋群岛。龙眼和荔枝肉多味美，可鲜吃和焙制成干，营养极为丰富，龙眼又是一种贵重的药品。枇杷，是早春唯一的果品，味甜、肉脆，加工后的枇杷膏又有药效之用。此外盛产的凤梨（俗名菠萝蜜）、橄榄、龙溪的天宝香蕉等等，都是别具风味受人欢迎的佳品。
    茶叶
    在我国著名茶区的福建，现在已经进入了春茶采制的大忙季节。目前，全省每天有十万茶农出入茶山，采摘春茶。到4月底，商业部门已经收购春茶二万八千多担，今年全省茶叶生产计划数比去年增加了70％，总产量达到三十二万担。
    福建茶叶种类多、品质好，红茶、绿茶、白茶、乌龙茶等色色俱备，而武夷岩茶、安溪铁观音、白琳工夫、正山小种银针等都是世界闻名的极品茶。
    武夷岩茶属于乌龙茶类，产在风景优美的闽北武夷山区。茶叶颜色青翠，油润有光，闻起来有一股幽香，其中大红袍、铁罗汉、白鸡冠等，更是稀有的名贵茶叶。被人称作红心绿银边，水泡七遍有余香的安溪铁观音，也是一种很名贵的乌龙茶。茶叶香气清高，入口微涩，饮后精神焕发，主销港澳和东南亚各地，素为旅外华侨所喜爱。白茶中的银针，是最名贵的极品茶之一，这种茶纯以大白茶的萌芽烘焙而成，芽毫颜色显白如银，泡水呈浅绿色，味清鲜爽口，为馈赠珍品。福建花茶，质量为全国之冠，它是不经过发酵的绿茶为原料，采用玉兰、茉莉等各种香花加工制成。产品名称以香花之名为名，如茉莉花茶、玉兰花茶、柚子花茶、水果花茶等几十种。此类花茶兼具茶、花之香，别具风格，泡水清碧明净，芬芳悦口。
    山珍
    在福建北部的广大林区里，除了生产大量木材、竹子等建筑用材以外，还出产大宗全国有名的香菇。香菇滋味鲜美，清香爽口，含有蛋白质、油脂、纤维素、维生素丁等养分。沙溪（闽江上游的一个支流）两岸林地上野生的红菇，也是一种富有营养价值的食品。
    福建还出产名贵的补药品——银耳，以闽南的诏安县为著名产地，一年能出产几万两。银耳含有丰富的糖、蛋白质等，食后能助肺、补血和帮助消化，质量和全国闻名的四川银耳一样。
    在闽江上游的沙溪、剑溪、富屯溪两岸的竹林里，出产大量的笋干，其中有一种冬季生产的名贵笋干，形状好像玉兰花瓣，味道非常鲜美，叫玉兰片。福建的山珍，在国内外享有盛誉，海外侨胞的餐桌上，常摆着从祖国来的香菇、玉兰片等。
    海味
    福建是我国主要渔区之一。福建盛产经济鱼类，有大、小黄鱼、带鱼、鲨鱼、墨鱼、鲳、鳗、鱿鱼、鲷鱼以及毛虾、梭子蟹、海参等数十种。其中有许多极为名贵的海味，如在厦门、漳州、泉州盛产的世界稀贵的文昌鱼，年产约有四十万斤，居世界第一位。文昌鱼营养价值颇高，它含有70％的蛋白质，也含有多量的碘和各种无机盐。文昌鱼体色略呈透明，身长二、三寸，细小如弦丝，头尾皂尖，生长在海滨的沙滩中，它头部的组织区划不明，无脑、无头骨、无脊椎，有软骨自尾直达头端，是由无脊椎动物过渡到脊椎动物的动物。因此，它不只是一种很好的海产食品，同时亦是研究生物演化史重要的实物材料。鰇鱼也是一种很好的海味，以厦门港所产的本港鰇鱼最佳，销往上海、广州、香港和南洋群岛各地。福建出产的海蚌，肉质味美清脆，是世界稀有和营养丰富的珍贵水产品。福建海蚌产区主要分布在闽江口附近的长乐县漳港，故又有闽江蚌之称。为了大量发展海蚌生产，今年已在漳港建立了一处人工海蚌养殖试验场，并开始进行人工孵幼苗的试验，该场计划今年生产海蚌五十万斤，作为向国庆十周年的献礼。
    海马：是贵重的药品，可作健身、补肾、强心等用，尤以治疗神经衰弱更有卓效。海马体形侧扁，长约八至九公分，体无鳞，头部初看似马头、体色褐黑或黄绿。同安东方红人民公社去年建立一个海马养殖池，放养一千多万尾幼苗，今年该县将适当扩建养殖池，大量生产海马。
    竹蛏：外形似人工养殖的缢蛏，但比缢蛏体大，一般头长十至二十公分，潜居在深水底层，目前还未人工养殖。竹蛏可以鲜食，但加工成干色泽淡黄，其味更加优美可口，出产在连江定海一带。
    海兔：是海生软体动物，排出的卵经过加工制成海粉。海兔本身肉体很少有人吃，海粉性凉，有追热解毒功用，主要销到内地矿区，饭食海粉可去热解煤气毒，治疗眼球发肿等职业性疾病很有效。厦门人工养殖海兔的历史攸久，是海粉主要产地，年产海粉一万斤左右。
    红蟳：是蟹类里最高贵的品种，广受国内外消费者欢迎，红蟳肉细味美，去年厦门杏林湾和晋江红旗公社已开始养殖。
