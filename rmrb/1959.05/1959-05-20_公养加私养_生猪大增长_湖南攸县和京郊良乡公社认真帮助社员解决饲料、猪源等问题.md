Changsha, This Paper’s Dispatch, 19th: You County, Hunan Province, has adopted a method that emphasizes both collective pig raising and helping commune members raise pigs privately, effectively mobilizing the enthusiasm of commune members for raising pigs. The total number of pigs in the county has increased from 100,800 at the end of last year to 155,000, of which privately raised pigs have increased from 10,500 to 39,700.

　　In developing hog production, the You County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party organized a discussion in various people's communes. Through the discussion, everyone realized that, on the one hand, it is necessary to collectively raise pigs, and on the other hand, it is necessary to give play to the enthusiasm of commune members to raise pigs privately, tap the potential of commune members to raise pigs, and specifically help commune members solve problems such as feed, labor, and piglets. After careful calculation and presenting the facts, some people's concerns about not wanting private pig raising, fearing that private pig raising would affect collective production, and competing with canteens for feed land were also dispelled.

　　After this, while actively developing collective pig raising, various localities earnestly helped commune members solve problems such as feed and piglets. The most important method of solving the feed problem is to use scattered idle land in front of and behind houses and along fields (a total of more than 12,000 mu in the county) to plant feed. At the same time, when plowing green manure, pig-raising commune members are allowed to ensile or dry-store some green manure as feed. In order to solve the problem of refined feed, the county stipulates that, regardless of whether it is publicly or privately raised, the county will allocate seven jin of rice for each piglet born, and fifty jin of grain for each sow that has given birth. Various communes also distribute some rice bran and broken rice to private pig farmers. In addition, various communes also stipulate that commune members are allowed to take uneaten grain from the canteen back as feed according to their rations.

　　Regarding the solution to the piglet source problem, on the one hand, commune members are mobilized to purchase piglets from the collective pig farms of the commune, and on the other hand, for commune members who have difficulties in coming up with money for the time being, the commune will first give him piglets, and after the pigs grow up and are sold, the capital will be returned to the commune.

　　You County has made clear regulations on the income from collective and private pig raising, and the disposal of accumulated fertilizer. First, the fertilizer accumulated from pig raising belongs to the fertilizer of the pig raising professional team, 85% is used for agriculture and 15% is used for feed land. 90% of the fertilizer from canteens and private pig raising is used for agriculture, and 10% is used for feed land. Fertilizer is paid for in cash or temporarily recorded at a price agreed upon jointly, and returned during the autumn harvest distribution. Second, the income from pig raising by professional teams belongs to the operating unit. The income from pig raising in canteens, after deducting the labor remuneration of the feeders, 5% to 10% of the public accumulation fund and public welfare fund, the rest all belongs to the canteen. All income from private pig raising belongs to commune members. Commune members who sell a fat pig to the state can give priority to purchasing two to three jin of oil and five to ten jin of meat. Third, the Party committees and brigade general branches of each commune have determined a secretary to be in charge of animal husbandry management, often hold meetings to summarize experience, and systematically train veterinarians.

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing:
　　This Paper’s Dispatch: Commune members of Liangxiang Commune in the suburbs of Beijing, with the help of the commune, have already received a large number of piglets from the collective pig farms of the commune and production teams to raise at home by more than 5,000 households.

　　Three months ago, this commune had mobilized commune members to raise some piglets in their homes. The commune members used their original pigsties and some available labor to raise the pigs very well. Recently, the commune studied the experience of these commune members in raising pigs at home and believed that while organizations at all levels of the commune collectively raise pigs, distributing some piglets to commune members for private raising has many advantages in solving pigsties, management, and further mobilizing the enthusiasm of commune members for production. This is a good way to develop the pig raising industry. Therefore, it was decided to implement the policy of simultaneously developing public and private pig raising in the commune's pig raising industry, and a series of corresponding measures were stipulated.

　　First, this commune made appropriate divisions of labor between public and private pig raising: the main task of collective pig raising is breeding and breeding, and private pig raising by commune members is responsible for fattening. This can avoid the difficulties in public raising management caused by the large number of piglets produced by sows and the slow speed of building pigsties, and can directly supply healthy piglets that are self-bred and self-raised to commune members, reducing pig diseases and deaths. Pig farms generally adopt two methods to supply piglets: one is that commune members purchase pig seedlings on account and raise them themselves, and the other is that the pig farm supplies pig seedlings, and the team and commune members are jointly responsible for raising them. After the piglets are fattened, the state purchases them at the listed price, and a portion of pork is issued to the pig-raising commune members for their own consumption as stipulated.

　　After solving the policy issue of simultaneous public and private pig raising, organizations at all levels of the commune also mobilized commune members to think of many ways to solve the pig feed problem. In addition to the commune allocating a batch of pig feed to commune members in accordance with state regulations, each production team is dividing a portion of scattered land to commune members to plant feed. Some teams also distributed some stored sweet potato seedlings to commune members, and many teams are calling on commune members to carry out the production activity of "one hundred melon and vegetable plants per household" in the courtyard. Many commune members have already achieved "going to the fields with hands full, and returning home with baskets full of vegetables." Now, elm leaves and locust flowers can be seen being swept everywhere by the village heads and roadsides, and many commune members who go to the fields also carry baskets and baskets, using their rest time to pick wild vegetables.

　　Will private pig raising by commune members affect collective labor? After strengthening leadership, this problem was also solved. Most commune members of Xiaozhuang Production Team have pigs at home, but the number of people attending the team has not decreased. Most of those who participate in pig raising are the elderly who cannot participate in team work and middle and primary school students who return home after school. Some commune members with fewer people also raise pigs. They said that in the past, they could raise pigs while going to the fields and grinding noodles to cook, but now that they eat in the canteen, how can they not find time to raise pigs?

　　In order to encourage the commune members' enthusiasm for accumulating fertilizer, the commune also stipulated a method of recording points for accumulating fertilizer, and a portion of cash can be pre-paid when collecting manure. Now, many elderly people get up early in the morning to put foot pads in the pigsty, collect firewood and grass, and pad the soil to accumulate fertilizer. Some production teams also allocated large carts to help commune members with difficulties pull soil to pad the pigsties. Commune members of Xiaozhuang Production Team, which has more than 200 households, have recently provided more than 700 carts of pen manure to the production team.

　　This people's commune, which has more than 14,000 households, now has an average of 1.7 pigs raised collectively and privately per household, and the number of pigs raised has increased by about 40% compared with the organization of the commune. Organizations at all levels of the commune and canteens have established their own pig farms and a large number of pigsties. The piglets needed by commune members are also being resolved.

    公养加私养　生猪大增长
    湖南攸县和京郊良乡公社认真帮助社员解决饲料、猪源等问题
    本报长沙19日电　湖南攸县采取集体养猪和帮助社员私人养猪并重的办法，有效地调动了社员养猪积极性。全县的生猪已由去年年底的十万零八百头，增加到十五万五千头，其中私人养猪由一万零五百头，增加到三万九千七百头。
  在发展生猪生产中，中共攸县县委组织各人民公社展开了一次讨论。经过讨论，使大家认识到，一方面要集体养猪，另一方面要发挥社员私人养猪的积极性，挖掘社员养猪的潜力，具体帮助社员解决饲料、劳力、猪源等问题。经过算细账，摆事实，还解除了一部分人不愿让私人养猪、怕私人养猪影响集体生产、与食堂争饲料地等顾虑。
    在这以后，各地便在积极发展集体养猪的同时，认真地帮助社员解决养猪的饲料、猪源等问题。在解决饲料方面，最主要的办法，是利用屋前屋后、田边坎边的零星闲散土地（全县共利用这样的土地一万二千多亩）种植饲料。同时在翻耕绿肥的时候，允许养猪的社员青贮或干贮一些绿肥作饲料。为了解决精饲料的问题，县里规定，无论公养或私养，每生一头小猪，由县拨给稻谷七斤，生过小猪的母猪每头给谷五十斤。各公社也分配一些糠皮、碎米给私人养猪户。此外，各公社还规定，社员按照定量没有吃完的粮食，允许从食堂拿回去作饲料。
    对于猪源问题的解决，一方面动员社员从公社购买小猪，另一方面对有困难一时拿不出钱来的社员，由公社先给他小猪，到猪长大出售以后，再还本给公社。
    攸县对于集体养猪和私人养猪的收入，和所积肥料的处理等，都作了明确的规定。第一，养猪所积的肥料，属于养猪专业队的肥料，85％用于农业，15％用于饲料地。食堂和私人养猪的肥料90％用于农业，10％用于饲料地。肥料一律按照共同议定的价格，付给现款或者暂时记账在秋收分配时归还。第二，专业队养猪的收入，归经营单位所有。食堂养猪的收入，除了扣除饲养员劳动报酬、50％到10％的公积金和公益金外，其余全部归食堂所有。私人养猪收入全部归社员。社员出售一头肥猪给国家，可以优先购买二至三斤油，五至十斤肉。第三，各公社党委、大队总支都确定了一个书记专管畜牧经营，经常开会总结经验，有计划地培养兽医。
    本报讯　北京郊区良乡公社的社员们，在公社帮助下，已有五千多户社员从公社和生产队的集体猪场，领得大批小猪回家饲养。
    在三个月以前，这个公社就曾发动社员家庭饲养部分小猪。社员们利用家中原有的猪圈和部分可以利用的劳动力，把猪喂养得很好。最近，公社研究了这些社员家庭养猪的经验，认为在公社各级组织集体养猪的同时，分出部分小猪给社员私养，在解决猪圈、管理和进一步调动社员生产积极性等方面，都有很多好处，这是发展养猪事业的一个好办法。因此，决定在公社的养猪事业上，实行公养私养同时并举的方针，并且相应地规定了一系列的办法。
    首先，这个公社对猪的公养和私养作了适当的分工：集体养猪主要任务是繁殖育种，社员私养，负责育肥，这样，既可以避免因母猪产仔多，建圈速度慢而产生的公养管理工作上的困难，又能以自繁自养的健康小猪直接供给社员，减少猪的疾病死亡。猪场供应猪仔一般采取了两种办法：一种是由社员以记账方式购买猪秧自己喂养，再一种办法是猪场供应猪秧，社员负责喂养，队与社员伙养。小猪育肥后，由国家依照牌价收购，并按规定发给部分猪肉给养猪的社员自行食用。
    在解决了猪的公养私养并举的方针问题以后，公社各级组织还发动社员想了很多办法解决猪饲料问题。除公社按照国家规定，为社员调拨了一批猪饲料外，各生产队正在划出一部分零星土地分给社员种植饲料。有的队还把一部分储存的白薯秧分给社员，不少队正在号召社员利用院中空地开展“一户百棵瓜菜”的生产活动。很多社员已经作到“上地不空手，回家菜满篓”。现在，村头路边，到处可以看到有人在扫榆叶、槐花，许多上地干活的社员也背筐挽篮，利用休息时间采摘野菜。
    社员私人养猪，会不会影响集体劳动？在加强领导以后，这个问题也解决了。肖庄生产队大部分社员家里都养了猪，但是全队出勤人数并没有减少，参加养猪的多是不能参加队内干活的老人和放学回家的中小学生。有些人手少的社员也养了猪，他们说，过去下地收工推碾子作饭还能养猪，现在在食堂吃饭了，怎能抽不出养猪的时间？
    为了鼓励社员们的积肥积极性，公社还规定了积肥记分的办法，打粪时还可以预支一部分现金。现在不少老人在天刚亮时，就给猪圈起垫脚，搂柴草，垫土积肥。有的生产队还拨了大车，帮助有困难的社员拉土垫圈，有二百多户的肖庄生产队的社员们，最近就给生产队提供了七百多车圈肥。
    这个有一万四千多户社员的人民公社，现在集体和私人喂养的猪平均每户已达一点七头，养猪的数量比组织公社时增加了40％左右。公社的各级组织和食堂，都建立了自己的猪场和大批猪圈。社员需要的小猪，也正在设法解决。
