Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 8th: Under the brilliant light of the policy of national equality consistently implemented by the Czechoslovak Communist Party, the Slovak national region has completely transformed its backward face before liberation in the fourteen years and become an industrial and agricultural region with modern industry.

The magnificent goal of completing socialist construction put forward by the 11th Congress of the Czechoslovak Communist Party stipulates that the difference in the economic levels of the Slovak and Czech regions must be completely eliminated in the short term. At present, the Slovak people are working hard towards this goal with the strong assistance of the Czech people. They will double Slovakia's industrial production by 1965 compared with 1957. By then, Slovakia's industrial production will approach the highly developed industrial level of the Czech Republic.

During the period of capitalist rule, Slovakia was only an agricultural appendage of the Czech region. At that time, Slovakia had not only few industries but also outdated and backward equipment. Since liberation, from the first five-year plan in 1949 to the present, Slovakia has built 202 factories and rebuilt 140 factories. In addition, ten new hydroelectric power stations and five thermal power stations have also been built. An atomic power station with a capacity of 150,000 kilowatts is also under construction in Slovakia. It can be put into production in 1960, which will be the first atomic power station in Czechoslovakia.

Next year, a huge metallurgical factory will also begin construction in Slovakia. When it is fully put into production in 1964, it will produce 66% of Czechoslovakia's total steel and 80% of steel products. By then, Slovakia's steel production will increase from 2.7% of the country's total steel production to 32%. In addition, some important chemical plants are also under construction or preparing for construction.

The Czechoslovak Communist Party and the government, under the principle of fully taking into account the characteristics of the Slovak nation and region, provided huge financial and manpower support to enable the Slovak economy to catch up with the Czech region as soon as possible. For example, the funds used by the state for construction in Slovakia greatly exceeded the value provided by the region in the national income. Therefore, in 1958, when the national industrial production level of Czechoslovakia increased by 300% compared with 1937, the Slovak region increased by 700%.

The unemployment, poverty, and backwardness that the capitalist era left to the Slovak people have long gone. The people's material and cultural living standards have been unprecedentedly improved. Slovakia's personal consumption level has increased by more than 90% since 1949, and this rate of increase far exceeds the rate of increase at the national level.

The socialist transformation of agriculture has also achieved good results in the Slovak region. By the end of 1958, cooperatives in the Slovak region occupied 67% of the agricultural land. Since liberation, Slovakia's agricultural production has increased by one-third, and it is expected to approach the level of agricultural production in the Czech region by 1960.

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, 8th: Czechoslovakia is full of dense forests, and many towns and villages are located in the surrounding jungles. Those tall larch trees, towering poplars, and beautiful birches not only provide a large amount of timber for national construction every year but also add a lot of beauty to Czechoslovakia's rivers and mountains.

The forest area of Czechoslovakia accounts for about 30% of the country's total area, with a timber reserve of more than 590 million cubic meters. The country's forests provide more than 11 million cubic meters of timber to the country every year.

This year, Czechoslovakia put forward the slogan of "plant all wasteland, plant a large number of fast-growing trees, and increase the yield per unit area of forests." Residents across the country actively participated in this work. It is expected that 12 million trees will be planted this year. (Attached picture)

### 在捷共的民族平等政策的光辉照耀下  斯洛伐克地区面貌日新月异

　　在捷共的民族平等政策的光辉照耀下
    斯洛伐克地区面貌日新月异
    新华社布拉格8日电　在捷克斯洛伐克共产党一贯执行的民族平等政策的光辉照耀下，十四年来斯洛伐克民族地区完全改变了解放前落后的面貌，变成了一个拥有现代化工业的工农业地区。
    捷共第十一次代表大会提出的完成社会主义建设的宏伟目标中规定，在短期内要完全消除斯洛伐克和捷克地区经济水平的差异。目前斯洛伐克人民正在捷克人民的大力援助下朝着这个目标努力，他们将在1965年使斯洛伐克的工业生产比1957年提高一倍，到那时，斯洛伐克的工业生产将接近捷克高度发展的工业水平。
    在资本主义统治时期，斯洛伐克只是捷克地区的一个农业附属地区。当时斯洛伐克地区的工业不仅少，而且设备大都是陈旧落后的。解放后从第一个五年计划开始的1949年到现在，斯洛伐克已经兴建了二百零二个工厂，改建了一百四十个工厂。此外，还兴建了十个新的水力发电站和五个火力发电站。一座功率为十五万瓩的原子能发电站也正在斯洛伐克兴建中。它在1960年可以投入生产，这将是捷克斯洛伐克第一座原子能发电站。
    明年，一座规模巨大的冶金工厂也将在斯洛伐克动工。当它在1964年全部投入生产后，将生产出目前捷克斯洛伐克全部钢铁的66％，钢材的80％。到那时，斯洛伐克的钢铁生产将由现在占全国钢铁生产的2.7％增长到32％。此外，还有一些重要的化学工厂也在动工兴建或准备兴建中。
    捷克斯洛伐克共产党和政府在充分照顾到斯洛伐克民族和地区的特点的原则下，提供了巨大的财政和人力的支援，以使斯洛伐克经济尽快赶上捷克地区。例如，国家用于斯洛伐克建设的资金大大超过了这个地区在全国国民收入中所提供的价值。因此，在1958年，当捷克斯洛伐克全国工业生产水平比1937年增长了300％时，斯洛伐克地区则增长了700％。
    资本主义时代遗留给斯洛伐克人民的失业、贫困和落后的情况早已经一去不返了。人民的物质和文化生活水平空前提高，斯洛伐克的个人消费水平从1949年以来提高了90％以上，这个上升速度大大超过了全国水平提高的速度。
    农业的社会主义改造也在斯洛伐克地区取得了良好的成绩。到1958年底，斯洛伐克地区的合作社已占有67％的农业土地。解放以来，斯洛伐克的农业生产增长了三分之一，预计到1960年就将接近捷克地区农业生产的水平。
    新华社布拉格8日电　捷克斯洛伐克到处都是茂密的森林，不少城镇和村庄就座落在丛林环绕之中。那些挺秀的落地松、高耸的杨树和秀丽的白桦不仅每年为国家建设提供大量的木材，而且也为捷克斯洛伐克的河山增添了不少美色。
    捷克斯洛伐克森林面积约占全国面积的30％，储木量为五亿九千多万立方公尺，全国的森林每年为国家提供一千一百多万立方公尺的木材。
    今年捷克斯洛伐克提出了“种完所有荒地，大量种植快速成长的树木，提高森林的单位面积产量”的口号。全国居民都积极参加了这一工作，预计今年将种植一千二百万株树木。（附图片）
