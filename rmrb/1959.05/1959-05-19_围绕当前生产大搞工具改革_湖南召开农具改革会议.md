According to the New Hunan Daily, the Hunan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened a provincial agricultural tool reform conference in late April. The conference summarized the experiences of the first quarter's tool reform and proposed the tasks for the second quarter. It required all regions to closely focus on current production, and based on production needs and possibilities, comprehensively address the repair, manufacture, reform, use, and management of tools for transportation, field management, water lifting, and plant protection, pushing the tool reform movement to a new stage of good quality, high usage, and significant results.

The conference believed that the tool reform work in the first quarter, driven by the spring plowing production campaign, was carried out more solidly and deeply. Party committees at all levels attached importance to and strengthened the leadership of tool reform, with a clear focus and effective measures. The masses' creative inventions were more purposeful, with more creation and promotion, and better use and effectiveness. According to statistics at the end of March, more than 670,000 various vehicles and more than 120,000 wooden boats were newly built in rural areas throughout the province, exceeding the original development plan. At the same time, cableways and wooden rails were developed according to local conditions, and roads were repaired accordingly. The work focused on vigorously developing quantity, paid good attention to quality, grasped manufacturing, and emphasized promotion and use, resulting in high utilization rates and significant results. At present, a network of agricultural implement manufacturing and repair has been initially formed throughout the province, with factories in communes, stations in brigades, and personnel in production teams.

The conference also conducted detailed discussions and research on the tasks for the second quarter, believing that the second quarter is a crucial period for agricultural production, with busy farm work, tight labor, and a large variety of tools needed. Party committees at all levels should strengthen the leadership of tool reform, requiring a close focus on current production and grasping projects that use the most labor and are the most time-sensitive, to vigorously promote tool reform. While continuing to focus on transportation tools, efforts should be made to vigorously promote field management tools and water lifting tools, as well as plant protection and harvesting tools. The conference determined that in the second quarter, over 260,000 various vehicles would be developed, 350,000 pieces of water lifting tools would be manufactured and repaired, 500,000 rapid rice harvesters would be manufactured, and 240,000 threshing machines would be newly made and repaired. Appropriate development of other various tools and attention to the repair of small agricultural implements were also emphasized. In terms of working methods, attention should be paid to comprehensively grasping the five aspects of "repair, manufacture, reform, use, and management," and it was emphasized that tool quality should continue to be improved, requiring the quality of newly manufactured and repaired tools in the second quarter to reach a pass rate of 90%, so as to better exert the actual effectiveness of tool reform. The conference required all regions to take measures to grasp experimental research and appraisal and finalization work. The conference believed that the "five comparisons and three combinations" appraisal method created by Nanxian and Hengshan could be promoted. The five comparisons are: comparing labor efficiency, comparing quality, comparing ease of operation, comparing scope of application, and comparing cost. The three combinations are: combining leaders, creators, and users for appraisal. The conference decided to hold some necessary training classes this year to train in the use of new agricultural tools, and to convene on-site meetings for appraisal and finalization. A rapid rice harvester training class was immediately conducted in Jilong Street, Hengnan after the meeting. A special study was also conducted on the issue of agricultural implement factories. The conference required the agricultural tool reform departments of all special districts, autonomous prefectures, cities, and counties to immediately organize forces to conduct in-depth investigations and research on various issues of agricultural implement factories, focusing on key areas, drawing on experience, strengthening management, and further improving agricultural implement factories.

    围绕当前生产大搞工具改革
    湖南召开农具改革会议
    据新湖南报消息　中共湖南省委在4月下旬曾召开全省农具改革会议，总结第一季度工具改革经验，并提出第二季度工具改革任务，要求各地紧密围绕当前生产，根据生产需要和可能，全面抓好交通运输、田间管理、提水工具和植物保护等工具的修理、制造、改革、使用、管理，把工具改革运动推向质量好、使用多、收效大的新阶段。
    会议认为：一季度农具改革工作在春耕生产运动推动下，开展得较扎实、较深入。各级党委重视和加强了工具改革的领导，中心突出，措施有力，群众性的创造发明的目的性更加明确，创造和推广都比较多，使用和收效也比较好。据3月底统计：一季度全省农村新造各种车子六十七万多辆，木船十二万多只，超额完成原定发展计划。同时，还因地制宜地发展了索道、木轨道，相应地修整了道路。在工作上注意了大力发展数量，也较好地注意了质量，抓住了制造，也重视了抓推广使用，使用率高，收效大。目前全省各地工具改革，已初步形成公社有厂、大队有站、生产队有员的农具制造修配网。
    会议对二季度的任务也作了详细讨论和研究，认为二季度是农业生产的关键时期，农活忙，劳力紧，需要的工具种类多，各级党委更要加强工具改革的领导，要求紧密围绕当前生产、抓住在使用劳力最多、在时间上最紧迫的项目，大搞工具改革。在继续抓好交通运输工具的同时，大抓田间管理工具和提水工具，大抓植物保护和收割工具。会议确定二季度发展各种车子二十六万多辆，制造和修理提水工具三十五万件，制造快速割禾器五十万部，新制和修理打稻机二十四万部，并且适当发展其它各种工具，以及注意作好小农具的添修工作。在工作方法上要注意把“修理、制造、改革、使用、管理”等五个方面全面地抓起来，并强调继续提高工具质量，要求二季度新制和修理工具的质量达到90％的合格率，以更好地发挥工具改革的实际效能。会议要求各地采取措施，抓好试验研究和鉴定定型工作。会议认为南县、衡山创造的五比三结合的鉴定方法可以推广。五比是：比工效高低、比质量好坏、比操作难易、比适应范围、比成本大小；三结合是：领导者、创造者、使用者三方面结合起来进行鉴定。会议决定今年内将要举办一些必要的训练班，训练新农具的使用技术，召开现场会，鉴定定型。快速割禾训练班已在会后紧接着在衡南鸡笼街进行。对农具厂问题也进行了专题研究。会议要求各专、州、市、县的农具改革部门立即组织力量，对农具厂的各项问题，选择重点进行深入的调查研究，吸取经验，加强管理，更进一步提高农具厂。
