Xinhua News Agency, New York, 4th. TASS reports: According to the "Worker's Weekly," the National Committee of the Communist Party USA recently held a meeting in New York.

    Lamar, the Secretary for Educational Issues of the National Committee, gave a report at the meeting on the problems faced by American youth. Thompson, the Executive Secretary of the National Committee, gave a report on the preparatory work for the Seventeenth National Convention of the Communist Party USA, which will be held this autumn.

    The "Worker's Weekly" reported that the National Committee welcomed Gus Hall back to work. For the past eight years, Hall has been unable to work due to political exile, imprisonment, and limitations on his civil rights due to judicial trials. At this meeting, he was elected as Secretary of the National Committee and Secretary of the Midwest Local Committee of the Communist Party USA. The National Committee also decided to strive to exempt Thompson from the new seventeen-month prison sentence threatening him.
