Diligent Watering and Ample Fertilization, Land Free of Weeds, Fields Free of Diseased Seedlings
    Ningxia and Inner Mongolia Strengthen Spring Wheat Field Management
    Heilongjiang Province Tensely Sows Field Crops
    Yinchuan, May 14 (By Our Correspondent) The 2,210,000 mu of spring wheat seedlings in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region are all strong and growing vigorously. Currently, the wheat seedlings in the plain areas are already four or five inches high. Across the fertile Yellow River Plain and the Liupan Mountains, there is a scene of vibrant green everywhere. A field management movement centered on eliminating third-class seedlings and promoting the upgrading of every mu of wheat field is being vigorously carried out throughout the region.
    The Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region started early and meticulously with this year's wheat field management. Currently, most of the wheat fields in the plain areas have been top-dressed twice, weeded twice, and generally irrigated once. The amount of top dressing for general fields is above 3,000 to 4,000 jin, and the amount of top dressing for large-scale high-yield fields reaches 6,000 jin. Many areas have also applied refined fertilizer to third-class seedlings to promote the upgrading of wheat seedlings.
    Since the sowing of wheat, all localities have carried out processing and management work step by step and have conducted inspections and comparisons from top to bottom. Since April, the autonomous region has organized two inspection teams to conduct a comprehensive inspection of the wheat seedling inspection, seedling protection, and field management work in the twelve counties and cities in the irrigation area. Communes, production brigades, and production teams in each county have also conducted continuous evaluations. All localities have also universally established a field management responsibility system, from team to group, from group to individual, implementing layer-by-layer contracting.
    Currently, the wheat in the Ningxia Plain is at the jointing stage, and all localities are paying attention to tightly grasping the four major measures of water, fertilizer, protection, and management, requiring them to achieve "four irrigations and four fertilizations, land free of weeds, and fields free of diseased seedlings" to ensure the smooth growth of wheat.
    Hohhot, May 14 (By Our Correspondent) Farmers of all ethnic groups in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region have won the first battle in the wheat high-yield competition. Nearly eight million mu of wheat fields throughout the region are a vibrant green, generally presenting a moving scene of full and strong seedlings. Currently, rural people's communes in various localities are vigorously grasping the field management of wheat seedlings, taking all effective measures to strive for a bumper wheat harvest this year.
    Members of various ethnic groups, including Mongolian and Han, in Hanggin Rear Banner have implemented ridge cultivation on more than 200,000 mu of wheat fields. Generally, one mu is divided into two to five plots. Recently, more than 13,000 people have been mobilized to continue building canals and embankments in preparation for irrigation. In Linhe County, the Chaomei People's Commune has transformed all 39,000+ mu of wheat field into ridge fields due to the promotion of the new type of embankment construction device with high work efficiency. Last year, this commune had three to five mu per plot. Now it has been changed to one to five fen per plot, and complete irrigation canals have been built. After cadres and the masses jointly went deep into the fields in various parts of Bayannur League to inspect and protect seedlings plot by plot, they remedied the wheat fields with missing seedlings and broken ridges, ensuring that every mu had full seedlings and eliminating blank areas. Because the wheat seedlings are growing fast and well, some communes in this league have started meticulous summer weeding work ahead of schedule. The wheat professional teams of the people's communes in Zhaowuda League and Jirem League have also recently started field management early, checking the seedling emergence situation and actively carrying out disease and pest prevention, busy repairing field canals, top-dressing and watering to promote the vigorous growth of wheat seedlings. Communes in Tumd Banner and Togtoh County in Ulanqab League have established wheat field management responsibility systems, formulated wheat field management measures, and some wheat fields have already been watered for the first time.
    Harbin, May 14 (By Our Correspondent) In Heilongjiang Province, where the season is later, the vast people's communes and state farm workers have mobilized various sowing agricultural implements and are stepping up the sowing of field crops at a rate of 3 million mu per day. It is estimated that three or four days after "Lesser Fullness," around May 25, the province can complete this year's sowing plan in a timely manner.
    The sowing quality has surpassed any previous year. The sowing plan for spring wheat has already been overfulfilled by 9%. The wheat fields are now a sea of green. More than 90% of the 27 million mu of field crops that had been sown by the beginning of May were sown with superior varieties. A considerable portion of the land has been applied with a considerable amount of base fertilizer, and fine fertilizer was also applied during sowing. In each people's commune, one can see large areas of farmland that have been harrowed, crushed, and compacted, as flat as a sports field, with newly raised straight ridges, and the distance between rows reduced from more than two chi in previous years to one chi and eight cun -- this is a measure taken to implement reasonable close planting. Many people's communes also have plots of ridge fields to experiment with new sowing methods.

    水勤肥足　地无杂草　田无病苗
    宁夏内蒙古加强春麦田间管理
    黑龙江省紧张播种大田作物
    本报银川14日电　宁夏回族自治区二百二十一万亩春小麦苗全苗壮，普遍生长旺盛。目前平原地区的麦苗已有四、五寸高，沃野千里的黄河平原和六盘山麓，到处一片新绿。以消灭三类苗，促进麦田亩亩升级为中心的田间加工管理运动，正在各地深入展开。
    宁夏回族自治区今年的麦田管理抓得早、做得细。现在平原地区小麦大部分追了两次肥，薅了两遍草，普遍灌了一次水。一般田的追肥量都在三、四千斤以上，大面积丰产田追肥达到六千斤。很多地区还给三类苗追了精细肥料，促进麦苗升级。
    各地从小麦播种以后，就一步紧接一步地开展了加工管理工作，并由上而下地进行了检查评比。4月以来，自治区组织了两个检查团，对灌区十二县市的小麦查苗、保苗和田间管理工作进行了全面大检查；各县的公社、生产大队、生产队，也都连续进行了评比。各地并普遍建立了田间管理责任制，由队到组，由组到人，实行层层包干。
    目前，宁夏平原的小麦正值拔节关，各地都注意紧抓水、肥、保、管四大措施，要求达到“四水四肥、地无杂草、田无病苗”，确保小麦顺利生长。
    本报呼和浩特14日电　内蒙古自治区各族农民在小麦丰产争夺战中打赢了第一仗。全区将近八百万亩麦田一片新绿，普遍呈现苗全苗壮的动人景象。目前，各地农村人民公社正在大抓小麦苗期田间管理，采取一切有效措施，力争今年小麦丰收。
    杭锦后旗蒙汉等族社员把二十多万亩麦田实行了畦田化，地块一般是一亩分为两块到五块，最近已出动一万三千多人继续修渠打堰，准备灌溉。临河县超美人民公社由于推广了高工效的新式打堰器，全社三万九千多亩麦田都变成了畦田。去年这个公社是三至五亩为一块，现在改成一分到五分地为一块，并修建起完整的灌溉渠道。巴彦淖尔盟各地经过干部群众共同深入田间，逐块进行查苗保苗工作后，把缺苗断垅的麦田作了补救，保证了亩亩苗全，消灭空白面积。由于麦苗长得快，长得好，这个盟的部分公社已提前开始进行细致的夏锄工作。昭乌达盟和哲里木盟各人民公社的小麦专业队，最近也提早展开田间管理，检查出苗状况，正在积极进行预防病虫害，忙着整修田间渠道，追肥浇水，促使麦苗茁壮成长。乌兰察布盟土默特旗、托克托县等地公社纷纷确立了麦田管理责任制，订出麦田管理措施，一部分麦田已经浇上第一次水。
    本报哈尔滨14日电　季节较晚的黑龙江省，全省广大人民公社和国营农场的职工出动了各种播种农具，每天以三百万亩的速度加紧播种大田作物。预计“小满”后三、四天，5月25日左右，全省就可以适时完成今年的播种计划。
    播种质量超过过去任何一年。春小麦早已超额9％完成了播种计划。麦田现在是一片青绿。到5月初已经播完的二千七百多万亩大田作物，90％以上都是播种的优良品种。相当大部分的土地都施了相当数量的底肥，而且在播种时又上了细肥。在各人民公社里都可以看到，大片耙碎压匀的农田，平整的像运动场一样，新起的笔直的垅台，行间的距离由往年的二尺以上，缩减到一尺八寸——这是进行合理密植采取的措施。很多人民公社还有一块块的畦田，进行新播种方法的试验。
