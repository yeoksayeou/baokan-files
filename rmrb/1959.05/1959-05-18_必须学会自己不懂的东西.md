    Must Learn What You Don't Understand
    Today, this newspaper publishes two news items about cadres learning agricultural technology. One is from Tongren County in Guizhou, and the other is from Gan County in Jiangxi. Cadres in both counties have improved their leadership skills and vigorously promoted current production because they have learned agricultural science and technology knowledge. The facts in Tongren and Gan counties once again prove that it is increasingly important for cadres to study natural science and agricultural production technology knowledge.
    As early as ten years ago, Comrade Mao Zedong told us in the article "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship": "Serious economic construction tasks are before us. Some of the things we are familiar with will soon be put aside, and the things we are not familiar with are forcing us to do." "We must learn what we don't understand." Reviewing these words today, ten years later, we feel their profound significance even more. In the Great Leap Forward, many new experiences and new problems emerged on the agricultural front. Some are related to work style, some are related to work methods, but more belong to the production aspect, belonging to agricultural science and technology. In last year's Great Leap Forward, we found the key to increasing agricultural production – the Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture. However, how can we best implement the Eight-Point Charter? There are still many issues to be explored. The needs of production development have raised these questions, and the broad masses of farmers urgently demand that cadres help them quickly solve these problems. Just as the cadres in Tongren County and Gan County said, it is no longer feasible for cadres to lead agricultural production with old experiences and work methods. This is the pressure of the situation. To achieve effective leadership in the continued Great Leap Forward in agriculture, we must increase new skills, we must learn production technology and agricultural science knowledge.
    The Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party required that "economic work must be done more and more meticulously." What is meticulousness? It is being in line with reality, it is acting in accordance with the objective laws of things. In agricultural production, it means grasping the laws of agricultural production development and acting in accordance with the laws of agricultural production development. To recognize the laws, master the laws, and consciously act in accordance with objective laws, we need to practice diligently and participate directly in production. But personal practice alone is not enough, because one's own, personal practice is always limited, and we also need to learn from others and learn from books. Comrade Mao Zedong once pointed out in "On Practice": "What we have sensed, we cannot immediately understand it; only what we have understood can we feel it more deeply." For example, fewer and fewer people still have doubts about whether close planting can increase production, but to what extent is close planting reasonable? Only by further mastering the laws of agricultural production development and improving the level of agricultural science and technology knowledge can we more deeply recognize and understand it.
    The experiences of Tongren and Gan counties also prove that agricultural science knowledge is not mysterious, and everyone can learn it. The key lies in having the right method, determination, and perseverance. The rural work cadres in these two counties, recognizing the responsibilities of cadres in the context of the Great Leap Forward in agriculture, are determined to learn agricultural production science and technology knowledge. They use methods such as participating in production, holding technical seminars, and reading books. In just a few months, they have already achieved great results. Their leadership level has improved, and their work has become smoother. It can be expected that as long as they persevere, they will definitely show greater effects day by day.
    The practice of the comrades in Tongren and Gan counties has set an example for us to learn and master scientific and technological knowledge. It is hoped that all rural work cadres can attach importance to this issue and, in conjunction with their own work, use all means to strengthen the learning of agricultural science and technology knowledge.

### 必须学会自己不懂的东西

    必须学会自己不懂的东西
    今天本报刊登了两条有关干部学习农业技术的消息。一条是贵州铜仁县的，一条是江西赣县的。这两个县的干部都因为学习了农业科学技术知识，提高了领导水平，有力地推动了当前生产。铜仁和赣县的事实再一次证明：干部学习自然科学，学习农业生产技术知识，是越来越重要了。
    早在十年前，毛泽东同志在“论人民民主专政”一文中就告诉我们：“严重的经济建设任务摆在我们面前。我们熟习的东西有些快要闲起来了，我们不熟习的东西正在强迫我们去做。”“我们必须学会自己不懂的东西。”十年后的今天重温这段话，更感到它的深刻意义。在大跃进中，在农业战线上出现了许许多多新经验和新问题。有工作作风方面的，有工作方法方面的，但更多的是属于生产方面，属于农业科学技术方面的。去年一个大跃进，我们找到了农业增产的钥匙——八字宪法。但是，怎么样才是最好地贯彻执行八字宪法？还有许多问题需要探索。生产发展的需要提出了这些问题，广大农民迫切要求干部帮助他们迅速解决这些问题。正像铜仁县和赣县干部们说的，干部用老的经验和工作方法领导农业生产已经不行了。这就是形势逼人。要在农业继续大跃进中实现有效的领导，就必须增加新的本领，就必须学习生产技术和农业科学知识。
    党的八届六中全会要求“经济工作一定要愈作愈细致”。细致是什么？是符合实际，是按照事物发展的客观规律办事。在农业生产上说，就是掌握农业生产的发展规律，并且按照农业生产的发展规律办事。要认识规律，掌握规律，并且自觉地按照客观规律办事，就需要认真去实践，去直接参加生产。但是仅仅有个人的实践还是不够的，因为自己的、个人的实践总是有限的，还需要向别人学习，向书本学习。毛泽东同志在“实践论”中曾经指出：“感觉到了的东西，我们不能立刻理解它，只有理解了的东西才更深刻地感觉它。”例如，对密植能增产仍抱怀疑态度的人越来越少了，但是密植到什么程度才是合理的？只有进一步掌握了农业生产发展规律，提高了农业科学技术知识水平，才能更深刻地认识和理解它。
    铜仁和赣县的经验也证明：农业科学知识并不神秘，而且人人可学，关键在于方法对头，有决心，能坚持。这两个县的农村工作干部，认清了在农业大跃进形势下干部的责任，决心学习农业生产科学技术知识，他们用参加生产、开技术座谈会、读书等等办法，只几个月的时间，就已经大见成效，领导水平提高了，工作也更顺利了。可以预期，只要他们坚持下去，定会与日俱增地显示其更大的效果。
    铜仁、赣县的同志们的实践给我们学习和掌握科学技术知识树立了榜样。希望所有的农村工作干部，都能够重视这个问题，结合自己的工作，用一切办法加强对农业科学技术知识的学习。
