Voices of Hong Kong and Macao Compatriots

Committee members Gao Zhuoxiong, Huang Xin'an, He Xian, Fei Yimin, Li Zisong, Wang Kuancheng, and Zhu Shilin said in a joint speech:

Hong Kong and Macao compatriots are elated and proud because the motherland is becoming increasingly prosperous and strong; they express extreme indignation at the Tibetan rebels seeking refuge with foreigners and attempting to split the motherland, and at Indian expansionists disregarding good faith and interfering in our internal affairs.

We are honored to participate in the First Session of the Third National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and to attend the First Session of the Second National People's Congress. We wholeheartedly and completely support Premier Zhou Enlai's Government Work Report and other reports by the leading comrades.

We come from Hong Kong and Macao. The patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong and Macao have unlimited yearning and love for the great socialist construction of the motherland. Every piece of news and every achievement of the motherland will arouse great concern and encouragement for the patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong and Macao. Premier Zhou's report is not only an epic summarizing the Great Leap Forward and a clarion call to encourage another leap forward, but also represents the aspirations and voices of 650 million people in adhering to peaceful coexistence and opposing aggression. Listening to this report has made us further recognize the wise and correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system. It is both touching and exciting!

The overfulfillment of the First Five-Year Plan has laid a solid foundation for our country's economic construction. The comprehensive Great Leap Forward in 1958, the first year of the Second Five-Year Plan, with its massive increase in the production of steel, coal, grain, and cotton, has been unprecedented in terms of quantity and speed, leaving the imperialists dumbfounded; and the success of the nationwide people's commune movement, like the rising sun, has made the imperialists tremble. This is a great achievement of the soaring enthusiasm and selfless labor of the people across the country under the glorious illumination of the Party's general line for socialist construction. Despite the imperialists and reactionaries' wanton fabrication of rumors and slanders, they cannot erase these achievements. Their lies of accusing us of "slave labor" and "breaking up families" have been shattered by ironclad facts. A happy and joyful life, a magnificent and splendid picture, is indeed unfolding before the eyes of the world.

It is impossible to be without difficulties on the road of progress for the people of the motherland. Premier Zhou's report has pointed out the direction for the continued Great Leap Forward for the people across the country, calling on the people across the country to continue to be diligent and thrifty and to work hard, which will ensure a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in 1959. We can be even more confident that in about three Five-Year Plans, our motherland will surely be built into a strong socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture.

Compatriots in Hong Kong and Macao always hope that the motherland will be strong and no longer subjected to aggression and insult as in the past. In the ten years since liberation, people have seen the increasing prosperity and strength of the motherland and the continuous improvement of its international status, and they cannot help but feel elated and proud. The patriotic unity in Hong Kong and Macao has also been strengthened day by day, and the patriotic united front has also been strengthened and expanded! Many patriotic compatriots are proud to be able to visit the motherland and participate in its construction. In 1958, the year of the comprehensive Great Leap Forward in the motherland, more than 40,000 technicians and their families returned to the motherland from Hong Kong and Macao. The technicians all had jobs in Hong Kong, and some veteran technicians even preferred to give up their retirement pensions to rush back. This shows, on the one hand, the selfless and selfless spirit of the working class, and on the other hand, how the socialist construction of the motherland is attracting patriotic compatriots from Hong Kong and Macao.

Recently, the wise and correct measures taken by the Central People's Government to thoroughly quell the Tibetan rebellion have been supported by patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong and Macao, who have unanimously condemned the small number of Tibetan rebels who betrayed the motherland. We believe that Premier Zhou's firm and tolerant position in the report on the Dalai Lama and the neighboring country of India has not only been sincerely supported by the people across the country, including patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong and Macao, but also, in principle, will not leave the Dalai Lama, who was abducted to India, and Indian friends who are willing to abide by the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence indifferent. Unexpectedly, a few days ago, Indian diplomatic officials distributed a so-called "statement by the Dalai Lama" that openly demanded "independence" for Tibet. This is clearly an open support for the Tibetan rebellion and interference in our internal affairs. This cannot help but make people ask: What do these unfriendly behaviors have in common with the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence jointly advocated by China and India? What good will these unfriendly behaviors do for world peace and the Indian people, other than benefiting Western imperialists and colonialists?

We, the patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong and Macao, express our great indignation at the Tibetan rebels seeking refuge with foreigners and openly attempting to split the motherland, and at Indian expansionist elements disregarding good faith and openly interfering in our internal affairs. We believe that the Indian people will certainly cherish Sino-Indian friendship and oppose the arrogant behavior of expansionist elements. Our government's firm policy of safeguarding peace and opposing aggression will inevitably be supported by peace-loving people all over the world. Those who deliberately undermine Sino-Indian friendship and create tension will ultimately waste their efforts.

We are in an era of great changes and brilliant achievements in the motherland, an era of the East wind prevailing over the West wind and peace prevailing over war. As Chinese people, we feel particularly honored and proud. However, we who live in Hong Kong and Macao have different living environments from the mainland, which cannot help but make us feel that we are "falling behind the times." During the conference, we met many friends who had actively strived to participate in labor training. From their words and deeds, we could perceive their ideological improvement and happy mood. This shows the supreme benefit and absolute necessity of self-transformation for intellectuals. "Although I cannot reach it, my heart yearns for it." In the future, we are also determined to study hard, study Marxism-Leninism and Chairman Mao's works, learn from the good examples of the people of the motherland, ensure that we do our job well, and make due contributions to the socialist construction of the motherland.

Let us congratulate the success of the conference! Congratulate the motherland for a greater leap forward!

### 港澳同胞的声音

专栏：

    港澳同胞的声音
    高卓雄、黄新彦、何贤、费彝民、李子诵、王宽诚、朱石麟委员在联合发言中说：
    港澳同胞因祖国日益繁荣昌盛而扬眉吐气，心花怒放；对西藏叛匪托庇外人、企图分裂祖国，对印度扩张主义者不顾信义、干涉我国内政，表示极大的愤慨
    我们光荣地参加中国人民政治协商会议第三届全国委员会第一次会议，列席第二届全国人民代表大会第一次会议。我们衷心地完全地拥护周恩来总理的政府工作报告和各位首长的其他各项报告。
    我们来自香港和澳门。港、澳爱国同胞对祖国的伟大社会主义建设，具有无限的向往和热爱。祖国的每一消息，每一成就，对港、澳爱国同胞来说，都会引起极大的关怀和鼓舞。周总理的报告，不但是总结大跃进的史诗，鼓舞再跃进的号角，而且是代表六亿五千万人民坚持和平共处、反对侵略的愿望和呼声。听了这个报告，使我们更进一步认识中国共产党和毛主席的英明正确领导，社会主义制度的无比优越。令人又感动，又兴奋！
    第一个五年计划的超额完成，已使我国经济建设，奠定了巩固的基础。第二个五年计划的第一年，即一九五八年的全面大跃进，钢、煤、粮、棉的大增产和大丰收，其数字之大，速度之高，都是史无前例的，已叫帝国主义者膛目结舌；而像太阳东升的全国人民公社化运动的成功，更使帝国主义惊心动魄。这是在党的社会主义总路线的光辉照耀下，全国人民的冲天干劲、忘我劳动的伟大成就。尽管帝国主义和反动派肆意造谣诽谤，也丝毫不能抹煞这些成就。而他们污蔑我们“奴隶劳役”，“拆散家庭”等等谎言，而已为铁的事实所粉碎。幸福欢乐生活，绚烂瑰丽的图景，确然展现于世人的眼前。
    在祖国人民前进的大道上，还不可能没有困难，周总理的报告，已为全国人民指明了继续大跃进的方向，号召全国人民继续克勤克俭、努力奋斗，这将保证一九五九年将有更大、更好、更全面的跃进。我们更可以坚信，在三个五年计划左右，我们祖国一定能够建设成具有现代工业、现代农业、现代科学文化的社会主义强国。
    港、澳同胞时刻希望祖国强大，不再像过去那样受人侵侮。解放以来的十年，人们看见祖国的日益繁荣昌盛，国际地位的不断提高，都不禁扬眉吐气，心花怒放。港、澳两地的爱国团结也是日益加强了，爱国的统一战线也是加强和扩大了！许多爱国同胞都以能回祖国参观、回祖国参加建设为荣。就在祖国全面大跃进的一九五八年，从港、澳回到祖国的技工和家属，就有四万多人。技工们都是在香港有职业的，有些老技工甚至宁可放弃退休金，也要赶着回来。这一方面说明了工人阶级的忘我的和大公无私精神，另方面也可见祖国的社会主义建设事业是如何吸引着港、澳爱国同胞。
    最近中央人民政府彻底平息西藏叛乱的英明正确措施，港、澳爱国同胞都纷纷表示拥护，并对背叛祖国的少数西藏叛匪一致声讨。而周总理在报告中对达赖喇嘛、印度邻邦所申明的坚定而宽容的立场，我们以为，不但已为全国人民包括港、澳爱国同胞所衷诚拥护，就是被劫持赴印度的达赖喇嘛和愿意遵守和平共处五项原则的印度友人，照理也不会无动于衷。不料，前几天，印度外交官员，竟然散发以公开要求西藏“独立”为内容的所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”。这显然是公开支持西藏叛乱，干涉我国内政。这就不禁叫人要问：这种不友好的行为，究竟和中印两国所共同倡导的和平共处五项原则有何共通之处？这种不友好的行为，除了对西方帝国主义、殖民主义者有利之外，究竟对世界和平、对印度人民会有什么好处？
    我们港、澳爱国同胞，对西藏叛匪托庇外人，公然企图分裂祖国，对印度扩张主义分子不顾信义公然干涉我国内政，表示极大的愤慨。我们相信，印度人民定会珍视中印友谊，反对扩张分子的狂妄行为。而我国政府维护和平，反对侵略的坚定政策，也必然得到全世界爱好和平人士的支持。那些蓄意破坏中印友谊，制造紧张局势的人，终究不过枉费心机。
    我们是处在祖国伟大变革，成就辉煌的时代，处在东风压倒西风、和平压倒战争的时代，作为中国人，是特别感到光荣而自豪的。但是，我们居住在港、澳的人，生活环境与内地不同，不能不使我们有“赶不上时代”之感。在开会期间，我们接触了不少曾经主动争取参加劳动锻炼的朋友，从他们的言谈举止，都可以察觉到他们思想提高，心情愉快。这就可以说明了自我改造对知识分子有无上的益处和绝对的必要。“虽不能至，予心向往之”。我们今后也决心认真学习，学习马列主义和毛主席著作，学习祖国人民的好榜样，保证做好岗位工作，为祖国社会主义建设作出应有的贡献。
    让我们祝贺会议成功！祝贺祖国更大跃进！
