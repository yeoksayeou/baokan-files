Xinhua News Agency, May 27th: The Polish men's and women's archery teams, who are visiting our country, held their first friendly match with the Chinese youth men's and women's archery teams in Beijing today. Polish male and female archers were far ahead in the first two shooting distances.

The friendly match was held on the athletic field next to the Beijing Gymnasium, with four archers from each side (two men and two women) participating. The men's competition events were: target shooting at 90 and 70 meters distance (36 arrows per distance); the women's events were: target shooting at 70 and 60 meters distance (36 arrows per distance). More than 200 Chinese male and female archers, who just participated in the National Archery Championships on May 26, were present to watch the competition today.

The Polish male and female archers were all skilled, and the arrows they shot were fast with a small parabola, and rarely missed the target rings. In the men's competition, 20-year-old Monchanski, the Polish archery runner-up, achieved the best score, reaching 421 rings (186 rings at 90 meters, 235 rings at 70 meters); followed by Tawakowski, the third-place winner in Polish archery, with 320 rings (144 rings, 176 rings); Xu Kaicai, the 19-year-old national archery runner-up from China, ranked third with 264 rings (94 rings, 170 rings). His score of 170 rings in the 70-meter shooting broke his own highest record of 167 rings in the National Archery Championships.

Among the female archers, the best score was achieved by Kannitzka, the third-place winner in Polish archery, with 442 rings (178 rings at 70 meters, 264 rings at 60 meters); followed by Zugowska, the Polish archery runner-up, with 432 rings (205 rings, 227 rings); Hu Qingmei, the 18-year-old national archery runner-up from China, ranked third with 269 rings (107 rings, 162 rings); Yang Xingjiao, the 17-year-old national archery champion from China, ranked fourth with 266 rings (116 rings, 150 rings). Among them, Hu Qingmei and Yang Xingjiao's 70-meter shooting scores (107 rings and 116 rings) broke the highest record of 88 rings created by Shanghai shooter Shi Xuefang in the National Archery Championships.

    波中举行射箭友谊赛
  据新华社27日讯  应邀来我国访问的波兰男、女射箭队，今天在北京第一次同中国青年男、女射箭队举行友谊比赛。波兰男、女射手在头两个射程的比赛中，成绩都遥遥领先。
    友谊比赛是在北京体育馆旁的田径场上举行的，双方各有四名射手（男、女各二人）参加。男子的比赛项目是：九十和七十公尺距离射准（每个射程射三十六箭）；女子是：七十和六十公尺距离射准（每个射程射三十六箭）。5月26日刚刚参加完全国射箭锦标赛的二百多名我国男、女射手，今天都到场观摩。
    波兰男、女射手个个技术熟练，他们射出的箭速度快、抛物线小，极少射不中靶环。在男子比赛中，二十岁的全波射箭亚军蒙契安斯基成绩最好，达到了四二一环（九十公尺一八六环，七十公尺二三五环）；其次是全波射箭第三名塔瓦科夫斯基，三二○环（一四四环，一七六环）；中国十九岁的全国射箭亚军徐开财成绩占第三位，二六四环（九十四环，一七○环），他的七十公尺射准一七○环的成绩，还打破了他自己在全国射箭锦标赛中创造的一六七环最高纪录。
    女射手中成绩最好的是全波射箭第三名坎尼茨卡，四四二环（七十公尺一七八环，六十公尺二六四环）；其次是全波射箭亚军祖戈夫斯卡，四三二环（二○五环，二二七环）；中国十八岁的全国射箭亚军胡青梅的成绩占第三位，二六九环（一○七环，一六二环）；成绩占第四位的是中国十七岁的全国射箭冠军杨型姣，二六六环（一一六环，一五○环）。其中胡青梅和杨型姣七十公尺射准的成绩（一○七环和一一六环），还都打破了上海射手施雪芳在全国射箭锦标赛中创造的八十八环的最高纪录。（附图片）
