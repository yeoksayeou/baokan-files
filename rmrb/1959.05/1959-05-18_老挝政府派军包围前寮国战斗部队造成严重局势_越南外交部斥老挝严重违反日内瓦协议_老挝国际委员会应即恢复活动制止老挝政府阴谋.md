Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, May 17th. The spokesman of the Foreign Ministry of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a statement today regarding the recent actions of the Kingdom of Laos’ Phoui Sananikone government, which seriously violated the Geneva Accords on Laos and created tension in Indochina. The statement said that the situation in Laos has become very serious in recent days. The Phoui Sananikone government is implementing a conspiracy that it has planned for a long time.

The statement said, "The Phoui Sananikone government has slandered the former Lao fighting units currently stationed in Luang Prabang and Xieng Khouang as opposing the government, and under this pretext, has dispatched a large number of troops, including artillery, to surround the former Lao fighting units, cutting off all sources of food supply, attempting to disarm these units. They have arrested and imprisoned some commanders, and may even create bloody conflicts to kill cadres and soldiers of the former Lao fighting units. The Kingdom of Laos government has clearly and extremely seriously violated the agreement signed between the Kingdom government and the former Lao fighting units."

The statement pointed out, "The already signed agreement stipulates that the Kingdom of Laos government must guarantee the democratic freedoms and free activities of the Patriotic Party, and the Constitution of the Kingdom of Laos also expressly stipulates the inviolable rights of parliamentarians. However, the Lao authorities, using the tension they created as an excuse, ordered the army and police to surround the residences of the leaders of the former Lao fighting units, including Prince Souphanouvong and many other parliamentarians. In many places, they have detained large numbers of Patriotic Party members."

The statement said, "The government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam believes that the above-mentioned actions of the Phoui Sananikone government blatantly violate the Geneva Accords on Laos and the agreement signed between the Kingdom of Laos government and the former Lao fighting units, exacerbate the tense situation in Laos and Indochina, and completely run counter to the desire of the Lao and Vietnamese people for peace and friendship." The statement also recalled the actions of the Phoui Sananikone government since taking office, under the instigation of U.S. imperialism, in undermining the Geneva Accords and the agreement signed with the former Lao fighting units.

The statement pointed out, "As one of the signatories to the Geneva Accords on Laos, and as a neighboring country with more than one thousand kilometers of common border with Laos and which has always hoped to maintain friendly relations with the Kingdom of Laos, the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam is deeply concerned about the seriousness of the development of the situation in Laos and the provocative actions of the Phoui Sananikone government."

The statement said, "The government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam firmly opposes these provocative actions, demands that the Phoui Sananikone government thoroughly fulfill the terms of the Geneva Accords on Laos and the terms of the agreement signed between the Kingdom of Laos government and the former Lao fighting units, demands that the Phoui Sananikone government stop its provocative actions on the Lao-Vietnamese border, and stop its actions that seriously violate the Geneva Accords."

The statement added, "The government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam believes that the International Commission for Supervision and Control in Laos must immediately resume its activities and conduct necessary investigations to stop the ongoing conspiracy of the reactionary forces acting as pawns of U.S. imperialism, which endangers peace in Indochina."

It said, "The government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam hopes that the two chairmen of the Geneva Conference must take appropriate measures to prevent the further deterioration of the situation in Laos."

It concluded, "The government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam declares that the actions of the Kingdom of Laos government, headed by Prime Minister Phoui Sananikone, have extremely seriously violated the Geneva Accords, created a tense situation in the border area between Laos and Vietnam, and undermined peace in Laos and Indochina. The Phoui Sananikone government must bear full responsibility for the adverse consequences it has caused."

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, May 17th. Vietnam News Agency quoted Lao sources received here on the 16th as saying: The Kingdom of Laos government, under the instigation of the United States, is stepping up its persecution of the former Lao fighting units and plotting to disarm them.

Vietnam News Agency said that the public opinion here believes that these conspiracies are completely contrary to the spirit of the military agreement signed between the Kingdom of Laos government and the former Lao fighting units on November 2, 1957. This agreement stipulates that after the transfer of Phong Saly and Sam Neua provinces to the Kingdom government, the Lao fighting units will be incorporated into the Kingdom army.

The Lao Patriotic Party's official newspaper, "Lao Patriotic News," had already exposed this conspiracy of the Kingdom of Laos government as early as February 14th of this year. The newspaper said: "Although an agreement has been signed, the Kingdom government is still planning not to incorporate all officers and soldiers of the former Lao fighting units as a whole into the army, but only to incorporate a small number of them, and expel the rest from the army. The officers and soldiers who are incorporated into the army will have their military ranks reduced by one level regardless of whether they agree or not. Those who are unwilling to accept the new military rank will be dismissed by the Kingdom army."

"Lao Patriotic News" interviewed Xin Kapo Chunlamani, a colonel of the former Lao fighting units, on the Kingdom government's decision to award him the rank of colonel. During the interview, he said: "...I do not refuse this military rank, but I request a postponement of the awarding ceremony. Because at present, the work of incorporating 1,500 former Lao fighting units officers and soldiers into the national army in accordance with the agreement to make the entire Lao people a whole has not been correctly implemented to this day."

Prince Souphanouvong, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Party, also protested in January of this year against the Kingdom government's failure to seriously carry out the work of incorporating officers and soldiers of the former Lao fighting units into the national army.

However, the Kingdom of Laos government has not yet stopped taking hostile and divisive measures against the former Lao fighting units.

    老挝政府派军包围前寮国战斗部队造成严重局势
    越南外交部斥老挝严重违反日内瓦协议
    老挝国际委员会应即恢复活动制止老挝政府阴谋
    新华社河内17日电　越南民主共和国外交部发言人今天就老挝王国培·萨纳尼空政府最近严重违反关于老挝的日内瓦协议、制造印度支那紧张局势的行为发表声明说，最近几天来，老挝的局势非常严重。培·萨纳尼空政府正在实行它策划已久的阴谋。
    声明说，“培·萨纳尼空政府污蔑目前驻扎在琅勃刺邦和川圹的前寮国战斗部队反对政府，并且借故派出包括炮兵在内的大批军队包围前寮国战斗部队，切断一切粮食供应的来源，企图把这些部队缴械。他们逮捕和监禁了一些指挥员，而且还可能制造流血冲突来杀害前寮国战斗部队的干部和战士。老挝王国政府显然已经极其严重地违反了王国政府同前寮国战斗部队签订的协议。”
    声明指出，“已经签订的协议规定，老挝王国政府必须保证爱国党的民主自由和自由活动，老挝王国宪法也明文规定议员的不可侵犯的权利。但是，老挝当局却以自己制造的紧张局势为借口，命令军队和警察包围前寮国战斗部队的领袖，其中包括苏发努冯亲王和其他许多议员的住宅。在许多地方，他们拘留了大批爱国党党员。”
    声明说，“越南民主共和国政府认为，培·萨纳尼空政府上述行为明目张胆地违反了关于老挝的日内瓦协议和老挝王国政府同前寮国战斗部队签订的协议，加剧了老挝和印度支那的紧张局势，完全违背老挝人民和越南人民要求和平和友好的愿望。”声明还回述了培·萨纳尼空政府当政以来，在美国帝国主义的唆使下破坏日内瓦协议和同前寮国战斗部队签订的协议的行为。
    声明指出，“作为关于老挝的日内瓦协议的签字国之一，作为同老挝有着一千多公里的共同边界和一贯希望同老挝王国维持友好关系的邻国，越南民主共和国政府对老挝局势发展的严重性以及培·萨纳尼空政府的挑衅行为感到十分忧虑。”
    声明说，“越南民主共和国政府坚决反对这些挑衅行为，要求培·萨纳尼空政府彻底履行关于老挝的日内瓦协议的条款和老挝王国政府同前寮国战斗部队签订的协议的条款，要求培·萨纳尼空政府停止在老挝和越南边境的挑衅行动，停止严重违反日内瓦协议的行为。”
    声明又说，“越南民主共和国政府认为，老挝国际监察和监督委员会必须立即恢复活动，并且进行必要的调查，制止充当美帝国主义爪牙的反动力量正在进行的阴谋活动，这种活动危害印度支那的和平。”
    它说，“越南民主共和国政府希望日内瓦会议两位主席必须采取适当措施来防止老挝局势的进一步恶化。”
    它最后说，“越南民主共和国政府宣布：以培·萨纳尼空首相为首的老挝王国政府的行为极其严重地违反了日内瓦协议，造成老挝和越南边境一带的紧张局势，破坏老挝和印度支那的和平。培·萨纳尼空政府必须对自己所造成的不良后果负全部责任。”
    新华社河内17日电　越南通讯社16日引述这里收到的老挝消息说：老挝王国政府正在美国的唆使下，加紧迫害前寮国战斗部队并且阴谋解除它们的武装。
    越南通讯社说，这里的舆论认为，这些阴谋是完全违背老挝王国政府和前寮国战斗部队1957年11月2日签订的军事协议的精神的。这项协议规定，在丰沙里和桑怒两省移交给王国政府以后，把寮国战斗部队并入王国军队。
    老挝爱国党机关报“老挝爱国报”早在今年2月14日就揭露了老挝王国政府的这一阴谋。这家报纸说：“虽然双方已经签订了协议，但是王国政府还在策划不把前寮国战斗部队的所有官兵作为一个整体并入军队，而只把他们中间少数一些人并入，把其余的人逐出军队。被并入军队的官兵不论他们同意不同意，军衔一律降一级。不愿意接受新军衔的人，王国军队将予以解取。”
    “老挝爱国报”就王国政府决定授予前寮国战斗部队军官辛卡波·春拉马尼上校军衔一事访问了春拉马尼。他在接见记者时说：“……我不拒绝这个军衔，但是我要求延期举行授衔仪式。因为在目前，根据使老挝全国人民成为一个整体的协议使一千五百名前寮国战斗部队官兵并入国家军队的工作至今一直没有正确地贯彻。”
    老挝爱国党中央委员会主席苏发努冯亲王，在今年1月间也曾经对王国政府没有认真进行把前寮国战斗部队官兵并入国家军队的工作提出过抗议。
    但是，老挝王国政府至今没有停止对前寮国战斗部队采取敌视和分裂的措施。
