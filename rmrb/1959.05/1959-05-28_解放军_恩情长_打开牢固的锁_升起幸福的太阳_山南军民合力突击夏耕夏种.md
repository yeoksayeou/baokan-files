Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 27th. Our correspondent with the army, Yu Fengyuan, reports: In the Shannan area in May, the high mountains are covered with snow, and the river valleys are full of spring scenery. In the fertile fields, everywhere is a joyous scene of military and civilians joining forces to assault summer cultivation and planting.

On May 10th, when the reporter arrived in Duozong, he saw groups of Tibetan compatriots and People's Liberation Army officers and soldiers active in the fields. Some were busy plowing and sowing, while others were digging canals to divert water from the Luozha Nu River for irrigation. Many early-planted highland barley and peas have already sprouted strong green seedlings. The Tibetan compatriots excitedly told the reporter that the seeds they sowed in these lands were mostly interest-free agricultural loans issued by the People's Liberation Army pacification troops and the Military Control Commission. In Duozong alone, more than 250 poor Tibetan households received more than 12,000 catties of seeds.

In the Dalongzong area, on the second day of the People's Liberation Army unit's entry, in addition to distributing 331 grams of interest-free agricultural loan seeds to 87 poor Tibetan households, it also allocated more than 70 iron plows, some warhorses, and all the horses seized from the bandits for the use of local poor Tibetan compatriots. At the same time, the unit also sent officers to organize a spring plowing production guidance group together with local Tibetan compatriots. With the strong support of the People's Liberation Army, the Tibetan compatriots put forward the slogan "Apply more fertilizer, sow good seeds, and do not leave an acre of land uncultivated," and quickly set off a production upsurge. In five days, they assaulted the sowing of land with more than 1,500 grams of seeds.

Now, the broad masses of Tibetan compatriots in the Shannan area, who have been reborn, sing happily while working: "The People's Liberation Army, your kindness is long, you opened the strong locks and raised the sun of happiness."

    解放军  恩情长  打开牢固的锁  升起幸福的太阳
    山南军民合力突击夏耕夏种
    新华社拉萨27日电  本社随军记者于逢源报道：5月的山南地区，高山积雪皑皑，河谷一片春色。在肥沃的田野上，到处是军民合力突击夏耕播种的欢乐景象。
    5月10日，当记者到达多宗时，沿途见到一帮一伙的藏胞和人民解放军官兵活跃在田野里，他们有的忙着耕田播种，有的开挖渠道，引洛渣怒河的水灌溉。许多早种的青稞和豌豆，已经长出茁壮的绿苗。藏胞们兴奋地告诉记者说，他们在这些土地上播下的种籽，大都是人民解放军平叛部队和军管会发放给他们的无息农贷，仅在多宗一地，就有二百五十多户贫苦的藏民领到了一万二千多斤种籽。
    在打隆宗地区，人民解放军某部进驻的第二天，除了给八十七户贫苦藏胞发放了三百三十一克无息农贷种籽以外，还调拨出七十多部铁犁、一部分战马和缴获叛匪的全部马匹，借给当地贫苦藏胞使用。同时，这个部队还派出军官同当地藏胞一起组织了春耕生产指导小组。在人民解放军的大力支援下，藏胞们提出了“多施肥，播好种，不荒一亩地”的口号，迅速掀起了生产热潮。他们在五天中，突击播种了一千五百多克种籽的土地。
    现在，获得新生的山南地区广大藏胞，边劳动、边欢乐地歌唱：“解放军，恩情长，打开了牢固的锁，升起了幸福的太阳。”
