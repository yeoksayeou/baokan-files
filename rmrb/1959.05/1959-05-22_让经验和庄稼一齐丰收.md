    Let Experience and Crops Both Reap a Bumper Harvest
    Su Yi
    During harvest season, besides mobilizing the masses to harvest crops in a timely manner and ensuring a bumper harvest, we should also mobilize the masses to summarize bumper harvest experiences. Bumper harvest experiences are also our enormous social wealth; they will bring us even greater harvests in the future. If we only focus on harvesting grain and oil crops without paying attention to harvesting bumper harvest experiences, it can be said that we have not achieved a comprehensive harvest.
    In last year's Great Leap Forward, the "Eight-Character Charter" for agricultural production increase was created. This year, when sowing summer harvest crops, generally, we acted in accordance with the principles of the "Eight-Character Charter." However, under various conditions, planting different crops, how to apply the "Eight-Character Charter" appropriately, and how to grasp the interrelationships of the eight measures, still require further seeking more detailed and specific experiences. After more than half a year of practice, there are now results. Now, we can carefully observe the rape and wheat in the fields to check whether the specific measures taken are appropriate and reasonable. In this way, we can further grasp the "Eight-Character Charter" and further understand the yield-increasing规律 of summer harvest crops and the yield-increasing规律 of general crops. The "Eight-Character Charter" originated from practice, and it must be continuously enriched and developed in practice. Under various different natural conditions, what kind of close planting is most suitable? To what extent is deep plowing most appropriate? How much base fertilizer and topdressing fertilizer should be applied? What kind of varieties have large ears and many grains? etc. We should conduct a field survey and research before and after the harvest, compare the plots with different growth conditions and different yields, and it will be clear at a glance. Chairman Mao said in On Practice: "Through practice discover the truth, and through practice verify and develop the truth"; and said: "Practice, knowledge, again practice, again knowledge, this form, cycles repeatedly to infinity, and the content of each cycle of practice and knowledge, are relatively advanced to a higher level." Timely summarizing bumper harvest experiences is specifically applying the epistemology of dialectical materialism, continuously and deeply uncovering the mysteries of nature, and continuously improving agricultural production.
    The masses greatly welcome such timely summaries. They said: "It is better to go to the fields to take a look now than to hold a meeting to recall it when winter planting comes." This is very reasonable. As the saying goes, "Hearing a thousand times is not as good as seeing once." Taking advantage of the crops being in the field, or while they are being harvested, on-site evaluation and summarizing experiences is the best time. This will not only play a significant role in striving for a bumper summer harvest next year, but will also be of great benefit in striving for a bumper autumn harvest this year. Letting the broad masses see more clearly that hard work and skillful work can indeed bear the fruit of a bumper harvest, and seeing the enormous effect of adopting advanced measures on increasing production, can help people further emancipate their minds, summon up their energy, and do a better job in summer sowing and field management.

    让经验和庄稼一齐丰收
    苏宜
    在收获的时节，我们除了发动群众适时收获庄稼、保证丰产丰收以外，还应该发动群众总结丰产经验。丰产经验也是我们的巨大的社会财富；它们将会在今后给我们带来更大的丰收。如果只注意收获粮食、油料而不注意收获丰产经验，就可以说没做到全面丰收。
    在去年的大跃进中，产生了农业增产的“八字宪法”。今年的夏收作物在播种的时候，一般是按照“八字宪法”的原则办事的。但是，在各种条件下，种植各种不同的作物，如何把“八字宪法”运用得恰到好处，对于八项措施的相互关系如何掌握，还需要进一步寻求更细致更具体的经验。又经过半年多的实践，现在已经有了结果。现在，就可以仔细观察田里的油菜、麦子，来检查一下采取的各项具体措施是否妥善、合理。这样，就可以进一步掌握“八字宪法”，进一步了解夏收作物的增产规律和一般作物的增产规律。“八字宪法”是从实践中产生的，还要在实践中不断地丰富和发展。在各种不同的自然条件下，什么样的密植最适宜？深耕到什么程度最恰当？底肥和追肥施多少才合适？什么样的品种穗大粒多？等等，我们在收获前后到田间去作一番实地的调查研究，把生长情况不同、产量不同的地块加以比较，就会一目了然。毛主席在实践论中说：“通过实践而发现真理，又通过实践而证实真理和发展真理”；又说：“实践、认识、再实践、再认识，这种形式，循环往复以至无穷，而实践和认识之每一循环的内容，都比较地进到了高一级的程度”。及时总结丰产经验，就是具体运用辩证唯物主义的认识论，不断深入地揭开自然界的奥秘，使农业生产不断提高。
    群众是很欢迎这样的及时总结的。他们说：“到冬种的时候再来开会回忆，不如现在到田里去看一遍。”这话说得十分有理。俗话说得好：“耳闻千遍，不如眼见为实。”趁庄稼都在地里，或者趁刚刚收获的时候，现场评比，总结经验，是最好的时机。这不仅对争取明年夏季丰收会起很大作用，对争取今年秋季丰收也会有很大好处。让广大群众更清楚地看到苦干巧干的确能结丰收之果，看到采用先进措施对增产的巨大作用，就可以帮助人们进一步解放思想，鼓足干劲，把夏季播种和田间管理工作做得更加出色。
