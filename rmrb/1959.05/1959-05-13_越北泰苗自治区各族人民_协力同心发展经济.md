Hanoi, May 12th (By Our Correspondent) – In recent days, various states within the Yuebei Thai-Miao Autonomous Region of Vietnam have held celebrations and exhibitions to warmly celebrate the remarkable achievements made in the four years since the establishment of the autonomous region.

Four years ago, on May 7th, the autonomous region was proclaimed and began to restore and develop its economy. Under the correct leadership of the Labor Party, this northwestern mountainous area has been gradually changing its old appearance over the past four years, and the lives of the people of all nationalities have improved significantly.

First and foremost is the rapid development of the autonomous region's agricultural economy. Rice and corn production have increased year after year, and an unprecedented bumper harvest was achieved in the late crop last year. The total harvest of rice and corn in the region reached 137,780 tons, an increase of 24% compared to 1955. The average per capita share was more than 390 kilograms, double that during the French rule. The phenomenon of widespread famine every year before liberation has been basically eliminated. In the first quarter of this year, the sown area of summer rice and corn in the autonomous region doubled compared to the same period last year, and close planting was generally implemented. It is estimated that the harvest will be greatly increased compared to last year. The mutual aid and cooperation movement in the autonomous region has developed greatly. At present, 97% of farmers in the region have participated in mutual aid teams and cooperatives. Since last year, 52 agricultural production cooperatives and a number of semi-mechanized state-owned farms have been established. Thousands of hectares of wasteland have been turned into fertile fields.

On the formerly barren mountains, the first batch of small-scale brick and tile factories and oil pressing factories have now been built. According to plans, soap factories, knitting factories, machine repair factories, and power plants will be built this year to further prosper the economy of the autonomous region.

In the past four years, the autonomous region has built two large hospitals with modern equipment and thirteen small hospitals, with five times more beds than during the French rule. Infectious diseases such as smallpox and cholera, which were seriously harmful every year before liberation, have been basically eliminated. The autonomous region has also opened hundreds of primary schools, double the number when it was first liberated. Special attention has been paid to the promotion of ethnic minority languages. The Thai language, which the French colonialists tried to eliminate in the past, is now widely popular throughout the region, and the Miao language has also been initially created.

Now, under the leadership of the Labor Party, the people of more than twenty nationalities in the autonomous region, including Thai, Miao, ＠, She, and Zhuang, have united into a big family of national unity and fraternity. The number of ethnic minority cadres has also increased to more than 1,000, five times more than when it was first liberated.

    越北泰苗自治区各族人民
    协力同心发展经济
    本报河内12日电  连日来，越南北方泰苗自治区各州纷纷举行庆祝会和举办展览会，热烈庆祝自治区成立四年来所取得的辉煌成就。
    四年前的5月7日，自治区宣告成立，并且开始恢复和发展经济。在劳动党的正确领导下，四年来，这个西北山区正在逐步改变着旧日的面貌，各族人民的生活也获得了显著的改善。
    首先是自治区农业经济的迅速发展。稻子、玉米年年增产，并在去年晚造获得了空前大丰收。全区稻和玉米的收获量达到十三万七千七百八十吨，比1955年增长24％，按人口平均每人得到三百九十多公斤，比法国统治时期增加了一倍。解放前每年饥荒蔓延的现象已经基本消除。今年第一季度，自治区的夏稻和玉米的耕种面积比去年同时期增加一倍，并且普遍实行合理密植。据估计收获量将比去年大大增加。自治区的变工合作运动已有很大发展。目前全区已经有97％的农户参加了变工组和合作社。去年以来，成立了五十二个农业生产合作社和一批半机械化的国营农场。成千公顷的荒地已经变成了良田。
  在旧日荒凉的山地上，现在已经建成了第一批小型的砖瓦厂、榨油厂，还要按照计划在今年内建设肥皂厂、针织厂、机器修理厂和发电厂等，以便进一步繁荣自治区的经济。
    四年来，自治区建设了两所拥有现代化设备的大医院和十三所小医院，病床比法国统治时期增加五倍。解放前每年危害严重的天花、霍乱等传染病，已经基本上被消灭了。自治区还开办了成百所小学，比刚解放时增加了一倍。民族文字的推广受到特别的重视，法国殖民者过去企图消灭的泰文，现在已经在全区内广泛流行，苗文也已经初步创造成功。
    现在，自治区的泰、苗、＠、舍、僮等二十多个民族的人民，在劳动党的领导下，已经团结成民族友爱的大家庭。民族干部也发展到一千多名，比刚解放时增加了五倍。
