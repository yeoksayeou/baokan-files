In order to ensure the realization of the Great Leap Forward in 1959, and in accordance with the spirit of "the whole country as a coordinated chess game" and implementation, the Water Conservancy Science Research Institute has revised and supplemented its 1959 scientific research plan.

The key tasks originally stipulated in the Water Conservancy Science Research Institute's 1959 plan included vigorously developing the use of local materials (earth, stone) for dam construction in water conservancy and hydropower construction, finding substitute materials and saving materials, and helping water conservancy and hydropower construction overcome the three barriers (equipment, machinery, and labor); scientific research on major projects in current water conservancy and hydropower construction; scientific research on the Three Gorges water conservancy hub; water conservancy issues related to the South-to-North Water Diversion project; water diversion to mountains and river network irrigation; the impact of water conservancy and soil conservation on runoff, floods, and sediment; treatment of the lower reaches of the Yellow River; special research on high water head hydraulic structures; improvement of water conservancy and hydropower calculation methods; experimental research on the survey and design of the Taohuayu water conservancy hub; the application of new technologies in the construction design of water conservancy and hydropower projects; and the exchange and promotion of new electromechanical technologies and existing scientific research results in hydropower stations, totaling more than 400 projects.

In order to make the 1959 plan more in line with the spirit of the whole country as a coordinated chess game, to more carefully distinguish priorities, to advance and retreat, and at the same time to be more in line with objective laws, to implement the plan, to prevent detachment from reality and conservatism, and to better complete this year's huge tasks, the Water Conservancy Science Research Institute further reviewed, revised, and supplemented the 1959 plan. On the whole, the original 1959 plan was not well balanced between urgent and non-urgent tasks, lacked sufficient cool analysis of objective conditions, and considered possibilities less. Among the more than 400 projects, some could not meet research needs due to a lack of materials. Others lacked full consideration of manpower arrangements, utilization of favorable conditions, and tapping of potential. Based on the above specific conditions, the Water Conservancy Science Research Institute determined that the principles for adjusting the 1959 plan are: those that require a large amount of equipment and materials and are currently impossible to do; those that have little significance for the national economy and production and are currently difficult to promote; those with too many topics, manpower difficulties, excessively dispersed force arrangements, and inability to implement; those that are proposed based solely on enthusiasm, for which specific measures cannot yet be conceived, and for which there is currently no certainty, will all be postponed or not listed as key projects. All those that fully utilize favorable conditions, tap potential, combine foreign and local methods, and are of great significance to the national economy will be added. For example, some projects in the Three Gorges project that are not currently urgently needed, the "research on replacing steel with plastics" project which is not very meaningful at present, and some projects with material difficulties have been decided to be postponed. At the same time, making full use of favorable conditions, the "research on evaporative cooling generators" and the "research on the third unit section of the Diaoyutai Power Station" were merged, so that the power problem of the evaporative cooling generator research could be solved by using the turbine of the third unit section as a power drive, thus eliminating the need to build another power station and allowing two experimental research projects to be carried out simultaneously with only one set of equipment. In addition, manpower was concentrated to advance work that is of great significance to water conservancy and hydropower construction and to list it as a key project, such as adding the "Wujiangxi Hydropower Station Research Group" to specifically solve the problems of Wujiangxi; and projects such as "high-speed construction methods for tunnel rock excavation," "stress analysis research of steel pipes and boiler shells," "stress analysis research of large head dams," and "research on the influence of complex foundations on gravity dam stress" are all urgently needed in current water conservancy and hydropower construction and have realistic significance for saving materials, and have all been included in the plan ahead of schedule.

After revision and supplementation, the 1959 plan has arranged priorities more appropriately, putting what should be first first, and what should be last last. In this way, favorable conditions can be fully utilized, manpower and materials can be concentrated, key projects can be better guaranteed, general projects can be taken care of, and the combination of scientific research and current water conservancy and hydropower construction can be further strengthened. All staff members of the institute are spirited and full of energy, striving to move forward and continuing the Great Leap Forward to complete this plan.

    根据实际情况　调整轻重缓急　更好保证重点
    水利科学研究计划更加落实
    本报讯　为了保证实现1959年的大跃进，根据全国一盘棋和落实的精神，水利科学研究院修订和补充了1959年度的科学研究计划。
    水利科学研究院1959年度原订计划中所规定的重点任务，包括大力展开水利水电建设中的利用当地材料（土、石）筑坝、寻找代用材料和节省材料、帮助水利水电建设过三关（器材、机械设备、劳动力）；当前水利水电建设中重大工程的科学研究工作；有关三峡水利枢纽的科学研究工作；南水北调引水路线水利问题；引水上山及河网化灌溉问题；水利化及水土保持对径流、洪水和泥沙的影响；黄河下游河道整治；高水头水工建筑的专题研究；水利水能计算方法的改进；桃花峪水利枢纽的勘测设计的试验研究；新技术在水利水电工程施工设计中的运用；水电站内机电新技术和已有科学研究成果的交流推广等问题，共计四百多个项目。
    为了使1959年的计划更符合全国一盘棋的精神，更细致地分清轻重缓急，有进有让，同时更符合客观规律，使计划落实，防止脱离实际和保守，更好地完成今年的巨大任务，水利科学研究院进一步审查、修订和补充了1959年度的计划。总的来看，原订的1959年度的计划，冷热结合得还不够，对客观条件的冷静分析比较少，从可能考虑也较少。在四百多项目中，有些由于材料缺乏，不能满足研究的需要。有些则对人力安排、有利条件的利用和潜力的挖掘等缺乏充分的考虑。水利科学研究院根据以上具体情况，确定调整1959年度计划的原则是：凡是需要大量器材设备、目前办不到的；对国民经济意义和生产意义不大目前也难推广的；题目过多、人力有困难、力量安排过于分散、无法落实的；单凭热情提出、具体措施还想不出来，目前没有把握的，都推迟或不列为重点。凡是充分利用有利条件、挖潜力、洋土结合，对国民经济有重大意义的问题则补充进去。例如三峡工程中某些目前不急需的项目，目前意义不大的“以塑料代钢的研究”项目，以及器材困难的一些项目都决定推迟。同时，充分利用有利条件，把“蒸发冷却发电机的研究”和“钓鱼台电站第三机组段的研究”合并，使蒸发冷却发电机研究的动力问题，利用第三机组段的水轮机作为动力带动，这样就不用再另修电站，只用一套设备就可以同时进行两项实验研究项目。另外，集中人力把在水利水电建设中有重大意义的工作提前，并列为重点项目，如增添了“五强溪水电站研究小组”，专门解决五强溪的问题；又如“隧洞岩石开挖的高速施工方法”，“钢管及锅壳的应力分析研究”，“大头坝的应力分析研究”，“复杂地基对重力坝应力影响的研究”等项目都是当前水利水电建设中急需解决的、对节省材料有现实意义的问题，都提前列入了计划。
    1959年度的计划，经过修订和补充，轻重缓急安排得更合适了，该先的先了，该后的后了。这样，就可以充分地利用有利条件，集中人力物力，既可以更好地保证重点，又可以照顾一般，也更进一步加强了科学研究与当前水利水电建设的结合。全院工作人员正意气风发，干劲十足，力争上游，为完成这个计划而继续大跃进。
