　　Bulgaria’s Leap Forward in Industry and Agriculture
　　Bulgaria, Peter Topchev

    In realizing the Party's general line proposed by Dimitrov, the leader and mentor of the Bulgarian people, at the Fifth Party Congress regarding the construction of a socialist foundation in Bulgaria, and with the consistent brotherly and selfless assistance of the Soviet Union, our country has undergone fundamental changes. In a short historical period, our country has transformed from a backward and poor nation into a prosperous country with modern, developed industry and highly mechanized cooperative agriculture. On this basis, the material life of the working people has been continuously improved. The first (1949-1953) and second five-year plans (1953-1957) for development along the socialist road have been successfully completed. As a result of this victory, socialist relations of production have been thoroughly and permanently established in both urban and rural areas.

    The Seventh Congress of the Bulgarian Communist Party, held in 1958, approved the third five-year plan (1958-1962) for the development of the national economy. The congress mapped out a grand vision for our country's development: to fully build a socialist society, further develop productive forces and strengthen socialist relations of production, and create the necessary economic conditions for a gradual transition from socialism to communism.

    The working people of our country have embraced the resolutions of the congress with great enthusiasm and are resolutely implementing them every day. Significant achievements could be seen in 1958; for example, the plan for industry was overfulfilled by ten billion leva (Bulgarian currency).

    Even capitalist countries have had to acknowledge the enormous achievements our country has made in various aspects of socialist economy and culture. These achievements are due to the correct policies of the Bulgarian Communist Party, which have created the necessary economic and cultural conditions for the rapid progress of our people.

    However, the practice and life of socialist construction prove that the potential for accelerated development along the socialist road is inexhaustible. The complete victory of socialist relations of production in cities and villages, the higher level of industry, the highly mechanized cooperative agriculture, the rapidly developing culture and the consciousness of the working people, in addition to the ever-expanding assistance and economic cooperation from the countries of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and the elimination of some unfavorable consequences caused by individual superstition—all of this has created the necessary conditions for our country to accomplish a leap forward in economic development along the socialist road in recent years.

    After analyzing the development and achievements of our national economy, the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party, at its October 1958 plenary session, put forward the basic and most important task to the Bulgarian people—to shorten the time limit for completing the third five-year plan. The November 1958 plenary session of the Bulgarian Communist Party pointed out and determined that the issue now is not about any other forward movement, but a leap forward in the economic development along the socialist road. At the same time, the plenary session also formulated the necessary measures to achieve our country's great leap forward task.

    At the plenary session of the Bulgarian Communist Party Central Committee held in January this year, a draft report on accelerating the development of the national economy and improving state and economic leadership, proposed by Comrade Zhivkov to the National Assembly, was adopted. The National Assembly session held at the end of March this year agreed to this report. The report made a comprehensive analysis of the nationwide movement caused by the historic resolutions of the October and November plenary sessions on shortening the completion period of the five-year plan, and formulated plans for the recent stage and the speed of progress in various aspects of our country.

    In order to ensure our country's leap forward in economic development, we must first achieve a leap forward in the development of industry and agriculture. In Comrade Zhivkov's report, the basic tasks of industry and agriculture in recent years were put forward, proposing that the five-year plan in industry should be completed in four years, and agriculture in three years.

    It is now stipulated that industrial production should be doubled by 1962, while the past plan stipulated an increase of only 62%. Compared with 1957, industrial output should be increased by two to three times by 1965.

    By 1965, our country's iron production will reach about 700,000 tons, steel—about 900,000 tons, and steel materials—700,000 tons, which is about six times more than in 1957. It is estimated that coal production will increase two to three times by 1965 compared to 1957. By 1965, electricity will reach 10 billion kilowatt-hours. The production of the chemical industry will increase six times by 1965 compared to 1957, focusing on increasing artificial fertilizers, with the production of artificial fertilizers reaching 1.5 million tons, or an average of 30 kilograms of chemical fertilizer per dekar (equivalent to 1.5 Chinese mu) of land, while in 1958 there were only 4.5 kilograms per dekar.

    Light industry and the food industry must also have new and rapid development. Light industrial production in 1965 will increase by about two times compared to 1957. By 1965, our country will produce 350 million meters of cotton cloth, 13 to 15 million pairs of shoes, etc.

    Due to the accelerated development of agriculture, the production of the food industry should increase by one and a half times by 1962 compared to 1957, rather than the 40% increase stipulated in the original plan.

    In agriculture, it is necessary to resolutely implement the important measures formulated to make the fullest use of the enormous potential, and by 1962 the total agricultural output value should reach 40 to 45 billion leva, which is more than double the figure expected to be reached this year. By 1965, it is expected that this figure will increase to 60 billion leva, which will exceed the total agricultural output value of 1957 by more than 45 billion leva. There will be great development in both horticulture and animal husbandry.

    The Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party very clearly instructed the economic, administrative and political measures that must be taken to complete the task of realizing the leap forward in development. The first is to improve the organization of labor in industry and agriculture and to tap all potentials to the fullest.

    In industry, the task of thoroughly utilizing the enormous possibilities of increasing labor productivity and increasing industrial products was put forward. This requires, first and foremost, the continuous development and most efficient use of existing and new technologies in industrial enterprises. Ensure further improvement of technological operating procedures, improve the skills of workers, improve the organization of labor, and apply assembly line operations in production. Ensure the normal supply of raw materials to enterprises. Strive to shorten the time for new industrial projects to be put into production.

    In agriculture, huge untapped potentials were pointed out. The first is to expand and consolidate agricultural production cooperatives, turning agricultural production cooperatives into diversified economies, and continuously increasing the products of horticulture and animal husbandry. In addition, it is also necessary to ensure the fullest use of all sources for increasing products, such as maximizing the use of agricultural machinery and manure, ensuring the adoption of necessary agricultural technical measures in cultivating land, and fully expanding irrigation areas.

    In addition to these practical measures proposed at the October and November plenary sessions, the January plenary session resolved the issue of reorganizing the state and economic leadership institutions. Due to the many new tasks in our country's economic development, state and economic leadership institutions were established by region. The specific leadership of the national economy was transferred to the newly formed administrative economic regions. The administrative economic region will become a unified entity of the entire social, political and cultural life of the region. The basic administrative unit in the region is the township people's committee, and the basic production economic units are agricultural production cooperatives and industrial enterprises. This reorganization combines decentralization and centralization, thereby better giving play to the creativity and initiative of the working people.

    In addition, measures to improve the planning and appropriation of the national economy, as well as measures to improve wage payment methods and strengthen the cooperative system in rural areas on the basis of combining individual and public interests, were also formulated. At the same time, methods to improve the material life of the working people were also proposed, and the minimum wage should reach 600 leva in the next few years and gradually transition to a seven-hour and six-hour workday.

    In addition to the measures related to economic and state leadership, the Party Central Committee also pointed out some shortcomings in our work style, which should be struggled against.

    All the working people of our country are extremely concerned about the resolutions made by the Party Central Committee's October and November plenary sessions on shortening the time limit for completing the five-year plan. These resolutions hit the hearts of the people precisely because they vividly reflect the people's fervent desire to reach communism as soon as possible. In a short period of time, a high tide of labor has been set off in our country. Workers in various enterprises, agricultural production cooperatives, and institutions, with high patriotic enthusiasm, have begun to explore new methods and find ways to apply these methods in production construction and transportation. Thousands of collectives immediately began specific and practical work to complete the Party's resolutions. A nationwide movement to shorten the completion period of the five-year plan and to achieve a leap forward in economic development has unfolded. Our motherland has never had such a great political and labor upsurge. The slogan of completing the five-year plan in a shortened period has become an irresistible material force. Our country has begun to live and breathe under the banner of this slogan.

    The discussion of Comrade Zhivkov's outline on accelerating the development of the Bulgarian national economy has turned into a creative discussion by the whole people on the vision pointed out by our Party to the people. More than 68,000 meetings and symposiums were held across the country to discuss this outline, with nearly 3.2 million people participating in the discussions.

    This great movement has already had some preliminary achievements. In the two months immediately following the October 1958 plenary session alone, the quarterly plan for industry was overfulfilled by 11.4%, and the plan for December was overfulfilled by 18.1%. In agriculture, 423 small reservoirs were built, 3,332 kilometers of irrigation canals were dug to irrigate 386,762 dekar of land, and 3,037 manure storage sites were built, etc.

    As we begin to implement the 1959 plan, we are entering the decisive battle to shorten the completion period of the five-year plan. According to the 1959 plan, production this year will be nine times greater than that of bourgeois Bulgaria in 1939, and will increase by 28.7% compared to 1958. The plan for the first two months of this year was completed by 103% in electricity, 105.9% in the fuel industry, and 107.8% in ferrous metals. In addition, in February alone, 1,036 enterprises created 121 million leva of over-planned production for the national economy.

    In agriculture, the struggle to increase agricultural production in 1959 by 73.9% compared to 1958 has also unfolded on all fronts. A series of measures have been taken to complete this plan. By February 24, 674,217 dekar of new land had been irrigated. Preparations are now underway to reclaim 1.5 million dekar of new land. Our people have embarked on the task entrusted to them by the Party. The task is clear, realistic, and within the reach of the people. In addition, in this great battle, our selfless and great friend—the Soviet Union and the entire socialist camp—stand by our side, continuing to provide us with assistance. The Party's resolution on accelerating the development of the national economy has shown our country a bright and splendid vision. (Attached images)

　　保加利亚工农业的跃进
　　保加利亚　彼得·托普契也夫
    在实现保加利亚人民的领袖和导师季米特洛夫在第五次党代表大会上提出的关于在保加利亚建成社会主义基础的党的总路线中，在苏联始终不渝的兄弟般的无私援助之下，我们的国家起了根本的变化。我国在短暂的历史期间，从落后和贫困的国家，变成了具有现代化的、发达的工业和高度机械化的合作化农业的富有国家。劳动人民的物质生活在这个基础上不断得到改善。按照社会主义道路发展的第一个（1949—1953年）和第二个五年计划（1953—1957年）都顺利地完成了。由于这个胜利，社会主义的生产关系就在城市和农村中彻底地和永久地确立了。
    1958年举行的保加利亚共产党第七次代表大会，批准了发展国民经济第三个五年计划（1958—1962年）。大会规划了我国发展的宏伟远景：完全建成社会主义社会，进一步发展生产力和加强社会主义生产关系，为逐步地由社会主义过渡到共产主义创造必要的经济条件。
    我国的劳动人民满腔热忱地接受了大会的决议，并且每天都坚决地执行着这一决议。在1958年就能看出相当大的成绩；例如，在工业方面的计划超额完成了十亿列弗（保币）。
    甚至资本主义国家也不得不承认我国在社会主义经济和文化各方面所取得的巨大成就。这些成就的获得是由于保加利亚共产党的正确政策，党为我国人民快速前进创造了必要的经济和文化的条件。
    然而，社会主义建设的实践和生活证明，沿着社会主义的道路加速发展的一切潜力是取之不尽的。社会主义的生产关系在城市和乡村的完全胜利，较高水平的工业，高度机械化的合作化农业，迅速发展的文化和劳动人民的觉悟，此外还有以苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国的不断扩大的援助和经济合作，以及对个人迷信所造成的一些不利的后果的消除，这一切都为我国在最近年代在社会主义道路上完成经济发展方面的跃进创造了必要的条件。
    保加利亚共产党中央委员会在分析了我国国民经济的发展和成就后，在1958年的10月全会上，向保加利亚人民提出了基本的和最重要的任务——缩短完成第三个五年计划的期限。在1958年举行的保共中央11月全会指出和确定，现在的问题不是关于任何其他的前进运动，而是经济沿着社会主义道路发展中的跃进。同时，全会还拟定了实现我国这个伟大跃进任务的必要措施。
    在今年1月保共中央举行的全会上，通过了日夫科夫同志向国民议会提出的关于加速发展国民经济和改进国家和经济领导的报告提纲。今年3月底举行的国民议会会议同意了这个报告。报告中对10月和11月全会关于缩短五年计划完成期限的历史性决议所引起的全民运动，作了全面的分析，并且拟定了最近阶段的规划和我国各方面前进的速度。
    为了保证我国在经济发展方面的跃进，首先必须实现工业和农业发展方面的跃进。在日夫科夫同志的报告中，提出了最近几年工业和农业的基本任务，提出了在工业方面的五年计划要在四年完成，而农业要在三年完成。
    现在规定，到1962年工业生产要增加一倍，而过去的计划规定只增加62％。和1957年比较，到1965年工业产量要增加两三倍。
    到1965年，我国铁的生产将达到七十万吨左右，钢——约九十万吨，钢材——七十万吨，即比1957年增加六倍左右。预计，煤的产量到1965年将比1957年增加两倍至三倍。到1965年，电力将达到一百亿度。化学工业的生产到1965年将比1957年增加六倍，重点是增加人造肥料，人造肥料的生产将达到一百五十万吨，或者平均每一狄卡尔（合一市亩半）土地上将有三十公斤化肥，而1958年每一狄卡尔只有四点五公斤。
    轻工业和食品工业也要有新的、迅速的发展。1965年的轻工业生产将比1957年增加两倍左右。到1965年我国将生产三亿五千万公尺棉布，一千三百万至一千五百万双鞋，等等。
    由于农业的加速发展，食品工业的生产到1962年要比1957年增加一倍半，而不是像原计划所规定的增加40％。
    在农业方面，要坚决贯彻为了最充分地利用巨大的潜力所拟定的重要措施，到1962年农业总产值要达到四百亿至四百五十亿列弗，即比今年预计达到的数字增加一倍以上。到1965年，预料这个数字将增至六百亿列弗，即将比1957年的农业总产值超过四百五十亿列弗。在园艺和畜牧业方面都将有很大的发展。
    保加利亚共产党中央委员会十分明确地指示了为完成实现发展跃进任务而必须采取的经济、行政和政治方面的措施。首先就是要改善工业和农业方面的劳动组织，最充分地挖掘一切潜力。
    在工业方面，提出了彻底利用提高劳动生产率和增加工业产品的巨大可能性的任务。这首先要不断地发展和最高效率地使用工业企业中现有的和新的技术。保证进一步改善工艺操作规程，提高工人的熟练程度，改善劳动组织以及在生产中运用流水作业法。保证正常地向企业供应原料。为缩短新的工业项目投入生产的期限而奋斗。
    在农业方面指出了巨大的未被利用过的潜力。这首先就是扩大和巩固农业生产合作社，使农业生产合作社变成多种经济的，并不断地增加园艺和畜牧业的产品。此外，还要保证最充分地利用一切增加产品的源泉，例如，最大限度地使用农业机器和粪肥，在耕种土地中保证采用必需的农业技术措施，以及全力扩大灌溉面积等。
    除了在10月和11月全会上提出的这些实际措施外，1月全会解决了关于改组国家和经济的领导机构问题。由于我国经济发展有着许多新任务，就按地区成立了国家和经济的领导机构。国民经济的具体领导转给了新组成的行政经济区。行政经济区将成为一区的整个社会、政治和文化生活的统一体。在区内基本的行政单位是乡人民委员会，而基本的生产经济单位是农业生产合作社和工业企业。这个改组把分散和集中结合了起来，从而可以更好地发挥劳动人民的创造性和积极性。
    此外，还拟定了改善国民经济的计划和拨款措施，以及改善工资支付办法和在个人利益和公共利益结合的基础上加强农村中的合作制度等措施。同时，还提出了改善劳动人民物质生活的办法，并且要在最近几年内使最低工资达到六百列弗和逐步地向七小时和六小时的工作日过渡。
    除了有关经济和国家的领导的措施外，党中央委员会还指出了我们工作作风中的一些缺点，对这些缺点应该进行斗争。
    我国全体劳动人民极其关心党中央10月和11月全会所作的关于缩短五年计划完成的期限的决议。这些决议恰巧中了人民的心意，因为决议活生生地反映了人民希望早日到达共产主义的热烈的愿望。我们的国家在一个短时期内就掀起了劳动的高潮。各企业、农业生产合作社和机关的劳动者们以高度的爱国主义热忱，开始挖掘新方法，找出在生产建设和运输中运用这些方法的途径。成千上万的集体立即开始了完成党的决议的具体的实际工作。为了缩短完成五年计划的期限，为了实现经济发展跃进的全民运动展开了。我们祖国从未有过这样巨大的政治和劳动的高潮。在缩短的时期内完成五年计划的口号成了不可抗拒的物质力量。我们的国家开始在这个口号的旗帜下生活和呼吸。
    对日夫科夫同志关于加速发展保加利亚国民经济的提纲的讨论，变成了全民对我们党向人民指出的远景的创造性的讨论。全国举行了六万八千多次会议和座谈会来讨论这个提纲，有将近三百二十万人参加了讨论。
    这个伟大的运动已经有了一些初步的成绩。仅在1958年10月全会后的两个月中间，工业的季度计划就超额完成了11.4％，而12月份的计划超额完成了18.1％。在农业方面建成了四百二十三个小水库，挖了三千三百三十二公里的灌溉渠来灌溉三十八万六千七百六十二狄卡尔土地，还建了三千零三十七个厩肥贮藏所等等。
    在开始执行1959年计划的同时，我们就进入了为缩短完成五年计划的期限的决定性战斗。按照1959年的计划，这一年的生产要比1939年资产阶级的保加利亚大九倍，而比1958年增加28.7％。这个计划的头两个月的计划在电力方面完成了103％，燃料工业——105.9％，黑色金属——107.8％，此外，在2月份仅一千零三十六个企业就给国民经济创造了一亿二千一百万列弗的超计划生产额。
    在农业方面，各个战线也展开了使1959年的农业生产比1958年增加73.9％的斗争。为了完成这个计划，采取了一系列的措施。到2月24日已经灌溉了六十七万四千二百一十七狄卡尔的新土地。现在正准备开垦一百五十万狄卡尔的新土地。我国人民已着手执行党交给他们的任务。任务是明确的、现实的，而且是人民力所能及的。此外，在这一伟大的战斗中有无私的、伟大的朋友——苏联和整个社会主义阵营站在我们一边，继续给我们援助。党所作的关于加速发展国民经济的决议给我们国家展示了光辉灿烂的远景。（附图片）
