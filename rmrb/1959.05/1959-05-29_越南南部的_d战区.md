    The "D Zone" was an anti-war base established by the Vietnam People's Army in Bien Hoa Province in the eastern region of southern Vietnam during the war. It is located east of Highway 13 in Bien Hoa Province, between the Be River and the Dong Nai River. The people in this area have been participating in the resistance war. After the restoration of peace in July 1954, the "D Zone," like all anti-war bases in southern Vietnam, was handed over to the South Vietnamese authorities for administration in accordance with the Geneva Accords. The former resistance personnel here were constantly subjected to cruel persecution and retaliation in the Thuy Ngoc Hau, Nguyen Trai, and other campaigns launched by the Ngo Dinh Diem regime from 1956 to 1958. Since mid-February of this year, the South Vietnamese authorities' acts of persecution have intensified unprecedentedly. They initially classified the masses and carried out "sweeps" in Vinh An, Cai Gao, Chanh Hung, Phuoc Hoa, and other places. Recently, they mobilized more than 10,000 infantry, engineers, artillery, and air force personnel, as well as thousands of police and "Civil Guards," to conduct the largest "sweep" since the restoration of peace in the entire former "D Zone." This military operation, like the one during the war, was carried out under the command of South Vietnamese General Duong Van Minh and American advisors. Under the cover of artillery and air force, the police and "Civil Guards" of the Ngo Dinh Diem clique surrounded and searched villages and households in the former "D Zone," and massively arrested former resistance personnel. At the same time, incidents of kidnapping, assassination, rape of women, robbery of property, and burning of houses occurred one after another. In March of this year, the Ngo Dinh Diem clique even escalated its actions by indiscriminately strafing and bombing with aircraft, causing heavy losses to the people. At present, this brutal persecution is still continuing and expanding to nearby Tay Ninh and Thu Dau Mot provinces.
    The South Vietnamese authorities' brutal suppression and persecution of former resistance personnel in the former "D Zone" and its surrounding areas is a serious violation of the Geneva Accords. Article 14(c) of the agreement explicitly stipulates that no retaliatory or discriminatory measures shall be taken against any individual or group because of their activities during the war, and that their democratic freedoms shall be guaranteed. To this end, General Vo Nguyen Giap, Commander-in-Chief of the Vietnam People's Army, and Ha Van Lau, Head of the Delegation of the General Command of the Vietnam People's Army, have successively lodged strong protests and demanded that the International Commission for Vietnam take resolute measures to ensure that Article 14(c) of the Geneva Accords is strictly implemented in South Vietnam and to protect all democratic freedoms of former resistance personnel.

    越南南部的“D战区”
    “D战区”是战争时期越南人民军在越南南部东区边和省建立起来的一个抗战根据地，位于边和省第13号公路东面，贝河与同奈河之间。这个地区的人民过去一直参加抗战。1954年7月和平恢复后，“D战区”像越南南部所有的抗战根据地一样，按照日内瓦协议的规定交由南越当局管理。这里的前抗战人员在1956年至1958年的吴庭艳政权发动的瑞玉侯、阮寨等战役中，不断遭到残酷的迫害和报复。今年2月中旬以来，南越当局的迫害行为更空前加剧。他们起初将群众加以分类，在永安、丐告、正兴、福和等地进行“扫荡”，最近又出动一万多名步兵、工兵、炮兵、空军以及成千名警察和“民卫队”在整个前“D战区”进行和平恢复以来规模最大的一次“扫荡”。这种同战争时期一样的军事行动是在南越军队杨文明中将和美国顾问的指挥下进行的。吴庭艳集团的警察和“民卫队”在炮兵和空军的掩护下，在前“D战区”里，逐村逐户地进行包围和搜索，大肆逮捕前抗战人员。与此同时，绑架、暗杀、强奸妇女、抢劫财产和焚烧民房的事件层出不穷。今年3月，吴庭艳集团还变本加厉地出动飞机滥施扫射和轰炸，使人民遭受惨重的损失。目前，这种残暴的迫害行动仍在继续，并且扩大到附近的西宁、土龙木省。
    南越当局对前“D战区”和它附近地区的前抗战人员施行残暴的镇压和迫害，是严重违反日内瓦协议的。协议第十四条丙款明文规定：不得对任何个人和团体因其在战时的活动而采取任何报复或歧视，并保证他们的民主自由。为此，越南人民军总司令武元甲和越南人民军总司令部代表团团长何文楼已先后提出强烈抗议，并且要求越南国际委员会采取坚决措施，保证日内瓦协议第十四条丙款在南越得到严格履行、保障前抗战人员的一切民主自由权利。
