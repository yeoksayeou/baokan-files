Xinhua News Agency, 10th: The National Agricultural Exhibition, showcasing the great achievements of agricultural socialist construction in 1958, closed today after receiving two million visitors.

The National Agricultural Exhibition, which opened on January 3rd, had received a total of more than two million visitors as of May 5th.

Chairman Liu Shaoqi, Chairman Zhu De and other national leaders visited the exhibition.

More than 3,200 international friends from more than 50 countries have visited the exhibition.

This National Agricultural Exhibition was held in the context of China's agricultural production winning a comprehensive bumper harvest in 1958. It is a general review of last year's agricultural Great Leap Forward and bumper harvest, and also a large classroom for spreading advanced experience and inspiring the revolutionary spirit of the broad masses. This exhibition has played a role in promoting the continued leap forward of national agricultural production this year.

During the exhibition, visiting delegations from 26 provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions across the country came to Beijing. The members of the visiting delegations were mostly cadres from Party organizations and governments at the provincial, special district, county, and commune levels, totaling 45,421 people. The exhibition also organized technical exchange activities for visiting delegations from various regions, including report meetings, seminars, screenings of science and technology films, and Q&A sessions. Many representatives carefully visited during the day, carefully recording the high-yield experiences of various regions; in the evening, they held seminars, and late at night, they organized their notes. Through their introduction activities after returning, the experience of last year's agricultural Great Leap Forward was spread and exchanged on a larger scale. (Attached picture)

    全国农业展览会闭幕
    新华社10日讯　显示1958年农业社会主义建设伟大成就的全国农业展览会，在接待了两百万观众后，今天宣告闭幕。
    全国农业展览会从1月3日开幕以来，据截至5月5日的统计，接待的观众共有两百万多人次。
    刘少奇主席、朱德委员长等国家领导人员都参观了展览会。
    包括五十多个国家的三千二百多位国际友人，曾经先后参观了这届展览会。
    这届全国农业展览会是在1958年我国农业生产赢得全面大丰收的情况下举办的，它是去年农业大跃进大丰收的总检阅，也是传播先进经验，鼓舞广大群众革命干劲的大课堂。这届展览会对今年全国农业生产的继续跃进起了促进作用。
    在展览进行期间，全国二十六个省、市和自治区都派出参观团来到北京。参观团的成员绝大部分是省、专区、县、社等级党组织和政府的干部，共达四万五千四百二十一人。展览会还为各地参观团组织了技术交流活动，包括报告会、座谈会、放映科学技术电影以及问题解答等，很多代表白天认真参观，仔细记下各地的丰产经验；晚上又进行座谈，深夜还整理笔记。通过他们回去后的介绍活动，去年农业大跃进的经验在更大的范围内得到了传播和交流。（附图片）
