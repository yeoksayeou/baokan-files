Xinhua News Agency, Baghdad, May 25th. Iraqi Prime Minister Kassem held a press conference at the Ministry of Defense on the afternoon of the 23rd. At the meeting, he talked about Iraq's foreign policy and issues related to domestic political life.

	Kassem said, "Now we have enough strength to repel any aggression." He said, "We have formulated a comprehensive plan to deal with any riots on our borders, especially in the north and east."
	Regarding anti-Iraq conspiracies, Kassem said that none of these conspiracies had succeeded. He said, "We were not afraid of them even when some people organized such conspiracies in our country. Now that we have eliminated these conspiracies, what is there to be afraid of?"
	Kassem said, "Iraq is a neutral and peace-loving country. It has no aggressive intentions towards any country. We are striving to strengthen our friendly relations with socialist countries because they are helping us and acting honestly, and we know they have no aggressive intentions."
	Kassem said, "We now enjoy sovereignty. No one can order us to do or not to do anything." He said, "We can get along with many countries in a friendly manner within the scope of mutual benefit. We have gotten rid of the shackles that bind our people, such as the Baghdad Pact, the Habbaniyah and Shaiba military bases, and the Eisenhower Doctrine. Now no country can cause hostility between us and other countries in the world. Except for those who do not want to be friendly with us and want to harm us, all are our friends."
	Kassem said, "As for Western countries, as long as they are willing to be friendly with us, we will not quarrel with them." The Prime Minister wanted the local newspapers to note that it was not necessary to specifically name American, British, French, or Portuguese imperialism. He believes that "imperialism is all those who vainly conspire against us, and the word imperialism is enough and includes everything."
	Talking about domestic political life, Kassem said, "The Iraqi revolution brought a republican system to the Iraqi people, allowing the people the freedom to express their opinions and establish trade unions and social organizations. The Iraqi revolution gave women the same rights as men and opportunities to participate in national political life."
	Kassem reiterated his position: "During the transition period, I do not encourage political parties to continue their activities." He said, "Any group that unintentionally opposes this, I will consider it to be against the security of the Republic."
	Kassem explained: "After the transition period, or possibly before the end of the transition period, political parties will be allowed to conduct activities." He said that the transition period will be very short. He said: "This will be the shortest transition period in revolutionary history."
	All political parties in Iraq were declared illegal by the old regime in 1954. After the Iraqi revolution, this ban has not been lifted.
	Kassem reiterated that he is non-partisan. He said: "I am not a member of any political party, nor am I a member of any class or any group. I am a member of the whole. The whole is my group." He also said: "I hope that the whole will unite as one group without division."
	The Prime Minister talked about the controversy caused in the country after the National Democratic Party recently issued a statement on banning party activities. He said, "The decision of the National Democratic Party is in line with my thinking. Some people think that this decision does not meet the wishes of the majority, but these people do not understand my words."
	Kassem believes that "parties can serve the country without going through party forms. There are now various groups, newspapers, etc." He said, "We are now in a revolution, and we hope it will be a pure revolution." He also said, "Although political parties have participated in the revolution to a large extent, they cannot succeed alone, and if it does succeed, it must have paid a huge 'price'."
	Kassem said: "I have strong evidence that imperialists are trying to divide the country." He said, "Don't think I am against freedom; on the contrary, those who want to give the people the greatest amount of freedom will not reach the extent we are reaching."
	Kassem said that certain events that have occurred recently have deeply affected him. He said, "These events may have been caused by certain conspirators or party members." He also said that in the short term, he will convene all party members to discuss with them. "I do not want disagreements to occur. I have studied the opinions of our brothers, the Communists, the National Democrats, and others. They are all democrats working for the benefit of the people."
	Talking about the external impact of the discussions in the past three days, Kassem said that this is not a good impact, as it weakens each group. Kassem said that any conspiracy can never succeed, because the eyes of the revolutionary leader are watching, and if something happens, he "knows what action should be taken." He guaranteed that no military personnel would be allowed to hit (naturally meaning intentionally) any civilians, either now or in the future.
	Kassem said that a cabinet reshuffle will be announced soon.

    卡塞姆谈伊拉克内外政策
    宣称过渡时期不鼓励政党活动
    新华社巴格达25日电  伊拉克总理卡塞姆23日下午在国防部举行了记者招待会。他在会上谈到伊拉克的外交政策和有关国内政治生活的问题。
    卡塞姆说，“现在我们有足够的力量击退任何侵略。”他说，“我们已经拟定了一个全面的计划，来对付我们边境上，特别是北部和东部的任何骚乱。”
    卡塞姆在谈到反伊拉克的阴谋时说，这种阴谋一个也没有成功。他说，“甚至有人在我们国内组织这种阴谋的时候，我们也没有怕他们。现在我们既然消除了这些阴谋，还有什么可怕的呢？”
    卡塞姆说，“伊拉克是一个中立的爱好和平的国家。它对任何国家都没有侵略意图。我们竭力加强我们同社会主义国家的友好关系，因为它们在帮助我们，并且行动诚实，我们知道它们没有侵略意图。”
    卡塞姆说，“我们现在享有主权。谁也不能命令我们作什么和不作什么。”他说，“我们可以和许多国家在互利的范围内友好相处。我们摆脱了束缚我国人民的枷锁，例如巴格达条约、哈巴尼雅和沙伊巴军事基地、艾森豪威尔主义。现在没有任何国家能够引起我们和世界上其它国家之间的敌视。除了不希望同我们友好，并且想伤害我们的那些人以外，都是我们的朋友。”
    卡塞姆说，“至于西方国家，只要它们愿意同我们友好，我们不同它们吵架。”这位总理要当地报纸注意，没有必要具体说明美国、英国、法国或葡萄牙帝国主义。他认为，“帝国主义就是所有那些妄想阴谋反对我们的人，用帝国主义这个字眼就够了，而且全包括进去了”。
    谈到国内政治生活，卡塞姆说，“伊拉克革命给伊拉克人民带来一个共和制度，使人民有表达自己的意见、建立工会和社会团体的自由。伊拉克革命使妇女同男人享有同等权利和有机会参加国家政治生活。”
    卡塞姆再次强调了他的这种立场：“在过渡时期，我不鼓励政党继续活动”。他说，“任何集团无意地反对这一点，我将认为这是反对共和国的安全。”
    卡塞姆解释说：“在过渡时期以后，或者可能在过渡时期结束以前，将允许政党进行活动”。他说，过渡时期将是很短的。他说：“这将是革命历史中最短的过渡时期。”
    伊拉克所有的政党都在1954年被旧政权宣布为非法。在伊拉克革命以后，这项禁令一直没有废除。
    卡塞姆重申，他是超党派的。他说：“我不是任何政党的成员，也不是任何阶级和任何集团的成员。我是全体中的一员。全体就是我的集团。”他还说：“我希望全体团结一致，成为一个集团，没有分歧”。
    这位总理谈到了在国家民主党最近发表了关于禁止党的活动的声明以后在国内所引起的争论。他表示，“国家民主党的决定是符合我的想法的。有些人认为，这个决定不符合大多数人的愿望，但是这些人没有懂得我的话。”
    卡塞姆认为，“党派可以不通过党派的形式为国家服务。现在有各团体，各报纸等等。”他说，“我们现在是在革命之中，我们希望它成为一个纯洁的革命。”他还说，“政党虽然在很大程度上参加了革命，但是它不能单独取得成功，如果它的确取得了成功，那一定花了巨大的‘代价’”。
    卡塞姆说：“我有有力的证据证明帝国主义者正在设法分裂这个国家。”他说，“别以为我是反对自由的，正相反，那些希望给人民以最大部分自由的人，不会达到我们正在达到的程度。”
    卡塞姆说，最近发生的某些事件使他受了很深的影响。他说，“这些事件可能是某些阴谋分子或可能是党派人员造成的。”他还说，在短期内他将召集所有党派人员，同他们进行讨论。“我不希望发生分歧。我已经研究过我们的兄弟，共产党人和国家民主党人和其他人的意见。他们全都是为人民的利益而努力的民主人士”。
    在谈到在过去三天中的讨论在外部造成的影响时，卡塞姆说，这不是好的影响，这削弱每个集团。卡塞姆说，任何阴谋都永远不能成功，因为革命领袖的眼睛在注视着，如果发生什么事，他“知道应当采取什么行动。”他保证说，不论在现在或将来，任何军人都不得打（自然指有意地）任何平民。
    卡塞姆说，不久将宣布即将进行的内阁改组。
