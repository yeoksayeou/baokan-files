　　Mutual Learning, Mutual Support, Mutual Promotion:
    Huangyan and Pingyang Advance Together in Competition
    Friendship rooted in last year's competition, cooperation blossoms again in this year's competition
    (Our report) Huangyan County and Pingyang County in Zhejiang, which engaged in linked competition and made common progress last year, have once again exchanged challenge letters and are vigorously drumming up enthusiasm for a friendly competition that is developing even more enthusiastically this year.
    Huangyan and Pingyang are located in the coastal area of eastern Zhejiang, more than 500 miles apart, with similar natural conditions. However, in 1957, the average grain yield per mu in Huangyan County was more than 100 jin higher than in Pingyang. Last spring, after the agricultural leadership departments of Zhejiang Province analyzed and compared the natural conditions and farming conditions of these two counties, Pingyang County put forward the slogan "Learn from Huangyan, Catch up with Huangyan," set advancement targets and effective measures, and competed with Huangyan. The 900,000 people of the county worked hard, caught up quickly, and learned and promoted Huangyan County's production experience in a timely manner throughout the year. The people of Huangyan County also took advantage of the victory and moved forward, overcame complacency, and doubled their efforts in the competition with Pingyang County. As a result of one year of linked competition, both counties increased grain production by nearly 100% in 1958.
    This year, when Pingyang County was vigorously preparing for farming, it received a letter of friendly competition from Huangyan County. The Pingyang County Party Committee immediately conducted a serious discussion, printed and distributed the competition letter to leaders at all levels, and organized the broad masses of commune members to study and discuss it carefully. Then, in the county's four-level cadre meeting and agricultural advanced unit representative meeting, in-depth discussions were held, and production increase targets were set to respond to Huangyan's challenge. The common goals of the two counties' competition this year are: to further increase grain production on the basis of last year's bumper harvest; to raise one pig for every mu of cultivated land on average; and to more than double the industrial output value.
    Mutual learning, mutual promotion, catching up with each other, the competitive situation between the two counties is even more enthusiastic than last year. Last year, Pingyang organized more than ten visiting groups, with a total of more than 1,000 people going to Huangyan to learn "experience" and find "treasures," so that many advanced experiences of Huangyan were timely put to practice and yielded results in Pingyang. This year, the people of Pingyang are learning even more modestly from Huangyan. So far, Pingyang has organized three visiting groups to visit and learn from Huangyan. The experience of cadres of the Wuyan Commune and Luqiao Commune in Huangyan County participating in labor and commune members participating in management has been rapidly promoted in Pingyang.
    Since this spring, Huangyan County has also sent delegations to Pingyang to visit and learn more than once. The leadership experience of the party branches of each production team in the Chengxi Brigade of the Wanquan Commune in Pingyang, and the experience of the Chengxi and Chengnan Brigades not having a single cadre detached from production, aroused great interest among the representatives of Huangyan County. Xu Jiliang, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Huangyan County Party Committee who led the visiting group, gave a detailed report after returning to the county and asked for it to be promoted throughout the county.
    Now, everywhere in Pingyang, you can see or hear slogans such as "Learn from Huangyan, Catch up with Huangyan, Surpass Huangyan"; in Huangyan, there are large-character slogans such as "Learn from Pingyang, Catch up with Pingyang, Surpass Pingyang." The leading organs, departments, communes, production brigades, and many production teams in Pingyang County have subscribed to the Huangyan Daily, and they are usually very concerned about Huangyan's production and learn from the experience introduced in the newspaper.
    In the competition between Huangyan and Pingyang, they not only catch up with each other in production, but also often provide mutual support in accordance with the principle of equal value exchange. Although Pingyang also lacks cattle, after hearing that Huangyan lacked even more, it transferred 300 head of cattle to support Huangyan's spring plowing; it also transported a large number of peanut seeds and taro seeds to Huangyan. Huangyan also donated a large number of mandarin orange saplings and thousands of jin of improved rice seeds to Pingyang County.

　　互相学习　互相支援　互相推动
    黄岩平阳在竞赛中一同跃进
    去年竞赛中扎下友谊根，今年再竞赛盛开协作花
    本报讯　去年挂钩竞赛一年、共同跃进的浙江黄岩县和平阳县，今年又互下战表，重擂战鼓，友谊竞赛开展得更加热烈了。
    黄岩和平阳位于浙东沿海地区，两县相隔五百多里，自然条件差不多，但是1957年黄岩县粮食平均亩产比平阳高出一百多斤。去年春天，浙江省农业领导部门把这两个县的自然条件和耕作情况进行分析对比后，平阳县就提出“学黄岩、赶黄岩”的口号，订出跃进指标和有力措施，同黄岩竞赛。全县九十万人民在去年一年中发奋图强，急起直追，及时学习和推广了黄岩县的生产经验。黄岩县人民也在同平阳县的竞赛中，乘胜前进，克服了自满情绪，加倍努力。一年挂钩竞赛的结果，两个县1958年粮食都增产近一倍。
    今年平阳县正在大闹备耕的时候，又接到了黄岩县的友谊竞赛书。中共平阳县委立即进行了认真的讨论，并把竞赛书印发给各级领导干部，组织广大社员认真学习和讨论。接着又在全县四级干部会和农业先进单位代表会上深入讨论，同时订出增产指标，向黄岩应战。两个县今年竞赛的共同目标是：粮食产量要在去年大丰收基础上再增产；平均每亩耕地养一头猪；工业产值翻一番以上。
    相互学习，相互推动，你追我赶，两县这种竞赛局面比去年更加热烈。去年平阳曾先后十多次组织参观团，共有千多人到黄岩取“经”找“宝”，使黄岩许多先进经验及时地在平阳开花结果。今年平阳人民更加虚心地向黄岩学习、到现在为止，平阳已三次组织参观团到黄岩去参观学习。黄岩乌岩公社和路桥公社干部参加劳动、社员参加管理的经验，已经在平阳迅速推广。
    黄岩县今春以来也不止一次派代表团到平阳参观学习。平阳万全公社城西大队各生产队党支部的领导经验、城西和城南两个大队没有一个脱产干部的经验，使黄岩县的代表发生了很大兴趣。率领参观团的中共黄岩县委书记处书记许继良回县后作了详细传达，要求在全县推广。
    现在，在平阳到处可看到或听到“学黄岩、赶黄岩、超黄岩”的口号；在黄岩也到处是“学平阳、赶平阳、超平阳”的大字标语。平阳县的领导机关各部门、各公社、生产大队和许多生产队，都订有黄岩日报，他们平时很关心黄岩的生产情况和学习报上介绍的经验。
    黄岩和平阳竞赛中，不仅在生产上你追我赶，还经常按照等价交换的原则相互支援。平阳虽然也缺牛，但听到黄岩缺得更多以后，就调出三百头耕牛支援黄岩春耕；还先后运送大批花生种子、蕉藕种子给黄岩。黄岩也把大量蜜桔树苗、几千斤水稻良种赠送给平阳县。
