Maritime Public Security Officer
—An Account of How Fang Baolin, Public Security Officer of Pingtan People's Commune, Wisely Annihilated the Chiang Kai-shek Bandit "63" Gunboat
Zhang Zhimin

At the beginning of February, the midday sun obscured the true face of the sea. Wisps of thin clouds wrapped around the sea and sky, and the sea surface was as calm as a lake. On the northeastern sea of Pingtan Island, two motorized sailing boats, dragging their nets and facing the gentle breeze, advanced slowly. These were the boats of the public security officers of the Liushui Brigade of the Pingtan People's Commune. To safeguard the safety of fishery production, they implemented "labor-military integration," netting with one hand and holding a gun in the other, working day and night, fighting on the maritime frontier.

After struggling against the wind and waves all night, Commander Fang Baolin instructed his comrades to take a break, but no one responded. Everyone's eyes were fixed on the net ropes trembling with the boat, estimating the amount of fish in this haul, rejoicing at the "big haul" of ribbonfish this year, and filled with joy for the commune's unprecedented bumper harvest!

Fang Baolin stood at the bow of the boat, shielding his eyes with his hand, peering intently towards the enemy for a while. As the bow turned, what appeared before him was his own fishing ground. On this famous "Niushan Ocean Fishing Ground," thousands of fishing boats were raising their sails and spreading their nets, taking advantage of this great time to search for the southward-migrating schools of fish. Seeing the scattered silver sails, he couldn't help but think that he was born on the sea, grew up on the sea, and had been fishing on the sea since he was ten years old, but his family didn't even own a single plank of a boat... But today it's different, he himself is the master of the sea. He watched mesmerized, lost in thought, and the spring breeze gently caressed his dark, bright shoulders, making his heart feel warm.

The sun shone on their heads, and more than a dozen young men, full of hope, were exerting all their strength to haul in the fishing nets they had cast early in the morning. Piles of fresh fish, gleaming with silver light, were still jumping in the net bags. At this moment, someone suddenly tugged on Fang Baolin's clothes and whispered, "Listen! Gunfire!"

Fang Baolin listened carefully, and indeed, there was gunfire coming from afar. Zheng Qinken, a demobilized soldier and deputy leader of the public security company, hurried over to observe the situation with him. This soldier, who had been a scout, instantly discerned that mixed in with the sparse gunfire was the sound of machine gun bursts, clearly indicating that the enemy had been discovered!

"Speed up hauling the nets, prepare for battle!" Fang Baolin issued the order, sending a signal to the rear about the enemy situation, while leading the people to prepare for battle. The people repeatedly checked the weapons in their hands, built fortifications at the bow of the boat, set up machine guns, and were all in high spirits and full of fighting spirit.

While listening to his comrades' discussions, Fang Baolin observed the enemy. He thought to himself that the enemy would never do what we want them to do. It's not enough to just estimate in a good direction, we should consider some difficult situations... Before he could tell everyone what he was thinking, he heard the sound of a motor coming. He looked through his binoculars and saw that the enemy ship was getting bigger and bigger, its tall bow cutting through the white waves as it sailed forward. Obviously, it wasn't a small boat. As the enemy ship gradually approached, he saw even more clearly the markings on the side of the ship, which was the most ferocious Chiang Kai-shek bandit "63" gunboat in this sea area...

"Target... Enemy... '63' Boat..."

This shout was like a torch, instantly igniting the hatred in people's hearts, and everyone's eyes turned red. The people living on Dongshan Island all knew that one early morning in the summer of 1951, hundreds of fishing boats were joyfully catching the peak-season yellow croaker on this sea when a ghostly whistle sounded. It was this Chiang Kai-shek bandit "63" gunboat that viciously burst into the fishing grounds and began to frantically slaughter these unarmed fishermen. Many people were killed and injured, and many fishermen were ruined and their families were destroyed. Some were captured on the spot, and their whereabouts are still unknown today... The people here had long engraved this towering blood debt on their bones and written it in their hearts!

"Fight them, eliminate them! Don't let them go back!" People were eager to fight, preparing to fight to the death. Although they knew that they were just two small boats, hatred and anger made them want to overcome everything.

As a commander, Fang Baolin observed the enemy situation while considering everyone's opinions. Thinking about the comparison of enemy and our forces, the enemy was a gunboat equipped with various firearms, while they were just two motorized sailing boats equipped with light weapons, without even any bulletproof equipment. If they fought, they might suffer losses, but then he thought that could our liberated fishermen be afraid of this sea pirate? Could they admit defeat in front of the Chiang Kai-shek army? A sense of heroic pride gave him the answer: No! A thousand times no! When he turned around and saw the thousands of fishing boats still fishing peacefully, he became even more convinced. He thought: To protect more fishing boats, we must subdue the enemy! Eliminate them! If we allow the enemy to act fiercely, then the losses won't just be one or two boats. Thinking of this, he raised his voice and shouted to the people: "Comrades, under our feet is our sea, behind us is our land, we are not alone! We have so many fishermen, we have the coastal defense forces! We must fight! Not only must we fight, ...we must also eliminate it... Destroy this '63' bandit..."

Artillery fire roared! The enemy boat approached step by step, two thousand meters, fifteen hundred meters, eight hundred meters... It was about to come close. This fisherman, who had never fought a war, was taking on the role of commander for the first time and was facing a "tough enemy." How should the battle be fought? He wasn't really sure in his heart, but he had a fiery loyalty to the motherland and an unwavering belief in victory. With these, the enemy boat became smaller than a yellow croaker in his eyes. With these, he felt that ten enemies couldn't match one armed public security officer. Infinite anger rose from his heart, and he skillfully directed the battle!

"Turn left... turn right..."
"Form a battle formation... the whole company advance..."
"Get ready... no firing allowed!" "..."

"Boom boom!" The enemy's shells exploded before their eyes, and bullets whizzed over their heads. The young men holding weapons, watching the enemy boat chasing after them and a group of enemies standing on the command platform pointing and firing at them, felt really "aggrieved" to endure the beating without fighting back! They urged Fang Baolin: "Baolin! We should fight! We should fight!..."

Fang Baolin didn't say a word, and stopped the people with his hand. In his mind, he was calculating: He wanted to take a beating first, so that the enemy would get the wrong idea, thinking they were easy to bully, watching and wanting to eat them, but unable to catch them for a while, slowly luring them into the effective firing range of the People's Liberation Army's coastal defense forces, and buying time for his own navy to enter the battle. Then, there would naturally be a way to deal with them.

According to this plan, he steeled himself, endured the grievances, and commanded the two fishing boats to circle around with the enemy boat. Unexpectedly, the enemy was not so "obedient." After fighting for a while, they realized they couldn't catch them and turned to go back!

At this time, Fang Baolin was really anxious. This was much more anxious than "taking a beating." In order to hold the enemy back, he commanded all the weapons on the boats to fire at the enemy boat, bang bang bang, machine guns and rifles, crackling like popping beans. The enemies standing on the bow immediately fell down four or five. The enemy became enraged and fired back at them!

A fierce battle unfolded on the sea! The enemy boat was showing off all its "skills" to destroy these two small boats. The brave public security officers, who were not afraid when they weren't fighting back, were even more unyielding when they took up arms. Everyone crawled to the bow of the boat and rapidly fired at the enemy. Zheng Qinken's heavy machine gun fired in one continuous blast, spewing towards the enemy boat like a tongue of fire. The battle became more and more intense.

"Comrades! Fight! Don't let it run away!" People fought more and more bravely, more and more fiercely. The light machine gunner's hand was wounded by the bullets, and fresh blood dripped down. He gritted his teeth, tore off a piece of clothing, bandaged the wound in the blink of an eye, and when he couldn't pull the trigger anymore, he crawled beside Zheng Qinken to load bullets for his heavy machine gun.

The enemy's shells exploded continuously beside the boat, stirring up water columns several feet high, and spraying up waves. The cannons hit the bow of the boat, piercing holes everywhere. The diesel drums were pierced, and black diesel oil poured out, splashing on people's bodies and faces... The small boats were tossed about in the raging waves, and looked like they would be sunk, overturned at any moment.

At this critical moment of life and death, people's anger rose even higher. Seeing the critical situation, Fang Baolin told everyone to open the grenade caps and prepare to fight the enemy hand-to-hand. Just as they were preparing to dedicate their lives for the country and the Party at the last moment, our brave People's Navy gunboats, riding the wind and waves, had already outflanked them from behind. They saw their own gunboats and cheered with joy. Seeing that his mission was nearing completion, Fang Baolin commanded the two boats to make way for the People's Navy's gunboats, exposing the enemy boat on the sea. Our artillery fire rained down like hailstones. In an instant, the enemy boat was seen with thick smoke rising and flames soaring, swaying and shaking, and then the stern rose higher and higher... But this was already the last time!

The Chiang Kai-shek bandit "63" gunboat was thus buried in the bottom of the sea. Of the twenty-three armed special agents, in addition to those killed and drowned, the rest were all taken prisoner.

    海上公安员
    ——记平潭人民公社公安员方宝林智歼蒋匪“63”号炮艇
    张志民
    2月初，傍午的阳光，隐去了海的真面目，丝丝薄云绕过海空，海面像湖水一样平静。平潭岛东北海面上，两只机帆船，拖着网绳、迎着微风，徐徐前进。这就是平潭人民公社流水大队公安员们的船舶。他们为保卫渔业生产的安全，实行“劳武结合”，一手张网，一手拿枪，日夜劳动，战斗在海洋前哨。
    和风浪搏斗了一夜，指挥员方宝林，嘱咐他的伙伴们抓紧时间休息一会，可没人应声。人们眼盯着那随船颤动的网绳，估计着这一网的鱼量，为今年的带鱼“大发海”，为公社的空前大丰收，心里充满着喜悦！
    方宝林站在船头，用手遮着阳光，凝神向敌方了望过一会儿，随着船头转动，出现在他眼前的，已是自己的渔场。在这著名的“牛山洋渔场”上，几千条渔船，个个扬帆张网，正趁这大好时光，搜捕南游的鱼群。望见那点点银帆，他不由得想到，自己生在海上，长在海上，从十来岁就在海上打鱼，自家却没半块船板……可今天却变了，自己就是海上的主人。他看得着迷，想得入神，春风轻擦着他黑亮的肩膀，心窝里觉得暖烘烘地。
    日头照在头顶，十几个小伙子，正满怀希望，用尽混身力气，起收那清早撒下的渔网，累累鲜鱼，闪着银光，还在网兜里蹦跳。这时一个人忽然拉了拉方宝林的衣服，轻声说道：“听！枪响！”
    方宝林侧耳听了听，果然有枪声从远方传来。复员军人、公安副连长郑琴肯，赶忙和他一起来观察情况。这个当过侦察兵的战士，一瞬间就已分辨出，在这疏稀的枪声里，还夹杂着机枪点射，分明是发现了敌情！
      “加速收网，准备战斗！”方宝林下达了命令，一面向后方发出敌情讯号，一面领导人们作战斗准备。人们一次又一次地检查着手中武器，在船头做好掩体，架好机枪，个个精神抖擞，斗志昂扬。
    方宝林一边听着同志们在议论，一边观察着敌人。心想，敌人决不会随着我们的意思来，光向好的方向去估计不行，该考虑些困难情况……还没容他把这番意思告诉大家，只听一阵马达声传来。他用望远镜看去，只见敌船愈来愈大，高高船头，劈开白浪，向前驶来。显然不是个小船。当敌船渐渐驶近时，更清楚地看到了船舷上的字样，却是在这一带海面上最凶恶的蒋匪第“63”号炮艇……
      “目标……敌……‘63’号……”
    这喊声像支火把一样，顿时点起人们心头仇恨，个个眼睛都红了。住在东庠岛上的人民，都知道在1951年夏天的一个清早，几百只渔船，正在这海面上兴高采烈地捕捉旺季的黄鱼，一阵鬼叫似的汽笛声传来，就是这个蒋匪第“63”号炮艇凶恶地窜入渔场，疯狂地屠杀起这些手无寸铁的渔民。多少人被打死、打伤，多少渔民被害得家破人亡，有的被当场抓走，到如今生死未知……这里的人民，早把这滔天血债，刻在骨上、写在心上！
    “打呀，消灭它！不准它回去！”人们磨拳擦掌，预备要同它拼了。虽明知自己是两条小船，但仇恨和愤怒，使他们要战胜一切。
    作为一个指挥员，方宝林一边观察敌情，一边考虑大家意见，想到敌我力量对比，敌人是带有各种火器的炮艇，自己只是两条配有轻武器的机帆船，上面连个避弹设备也没有，打起来，或许要遭受损失，但转念想到，咱解放了的渔民，能怕这个海贼吗？能在蒋匪军面前认输吗？一种英雄的自豪感给了他回答：不能！一千个不能！当他回过头来，望见那几千条渔船，还在安然捕鱼，更加坚定了他的信念，心说：要保卫住更多的渔船，只有把敌人打服！消灭！倘允许敌人逞凶，那时受损失的就不是一船两船。想到这些，他举首向人们喊道：“同志们，脚下是我们的海水，背后是我们的大地，咱们一点儿也不孤立呀！我们有多少渔民，我们有海防军！要打！不光要打，……我们还要消灭它……打掉这‘63’匪贼……”。
    炮火轰来！敌艇步步逼近，两千公尺，一千五百公尺，八百公尺……眼看要来到跟前了，这个从没打过仗的渔民，头次打仗自己就身担指挥员，并且碰上的是个“硬敌”，战斗应如何打法？心下确也没底，可是，他却有一颗火热的对祖国的忠心，有一个坚定的必胜信念。有了这些，那只敌艇在他眼里，就变得比条黄鱼还渺小。有了这些，他就觉得，敌人十个也抵不了他一个武装公安员，无限愤怒从心里升起，他运用自如地指挥起这场战斗！
    “左转……右转……”
    “成战斗队形……全连前进……”
    “准备好……不准射击！”“……”
    “轰轰！”敌人的炮弹在他们眼前爆炸，子弹掠过头顶。手中握着武器的小伙子们，眼看着敌艇尾随赶来，一群敌人站在指挥台上，指手划脚向他们发炮，甘挨打不还手，心里可实在有点“窝火”啊！他们催着方宝林：“宝林！该打了！该打了！……”
    方宝林一声不哼，用手把人们止住，哪知，他心里正在盘算：就是要先挨顿“打”，这样，使敌人发生错觉，以为他们很好欺负，眼睛看着，想把他们吃掉，但又一时抓不到，慢慢把它诱到人民解放军海防军的火器有力射程之内，并为自己海军争取了进入战斗的时间，那时，自然就有法子收拾它了。
    按照这套计划，他硬着头皮，受着委屈，在指挥两条渔船和敌艇兜圈子。不想，敌人却并不那么“听话”，打过一会，知道抓不到手，转头要往回走了！
    这时，方宝林可确实急了。这比“挨打”时要着急得多。为把敌人拖住，他指挥船上所有武器，一齐向敌艇开火，砰砰碰碰，机枪、步枪，爆豆似地叫起来，站在船头的敌人，立刻倒下了四五个。敌人恼羞成怒炮火齐发，向他们实行反击！
    一场激烈的战斗，在海面上展开来！敌艇施展着它全份“能耐”，要把这两条小船打掉，英勇的公安员们，在不还手时都没怕它，动起武器来更是不示弱，个个爬在船头，急速向敌人射击。郑琴肯的重机枪打成一个整响，火舌一样向敌艇喷去。战斗越打越激烈。
    “同志们！打呀！不许它跑掉！”人们越打越勇，越打越硬，轻机枪手的手被打伤了，鲜血滴滴流下。他咬着牙，扯下块衣片，眨眼间把伤口包好，再不能扣扳机，就爬在郑琴肯身边，为他的重机枪装起子弹。
    敌人的炮弹，连续在船边爆炸，激起几丈高水柱，扬起浪花，机关炮打在船头，穿起片片弹洞，柴油桶被打穿了，黑色柴油，滚滚喷出，喷在人们身上，脸上。……小船在狂浪里颠扑着，眼看要被打沉了，打翻了。
    在这千钧一发的生死关头，人们的怒火更是高涨。方宝林看到情况危急，嘱咐大家打开手榴弹盖子，准备和敌人肉搏。就在他们预备为祖国、为党最后献出生命的一刹那，我们英勇的人民海军炮艇，乘风破浪，已从敌人背后包抄过来。他们望见自己的炮艇，都高兴得拍手欢呼。方宝林看到自己的任务已近完成，指挥两船为人民海军的炮艇闪出“靶场”，让敌艇暴露在海面。我们的炮火，冰雹般砸下，一霎时，只见敌艇浓烟腾起，烈火冲天，摇摇晃晃，后来尾巴越翘越高……不过，这已经是最后的一次了！
    蒋匪“63”号炮艇，就这样葬入海底，二十三名武装特务，除打死、淹死以外，其余全都作了俘虏。
