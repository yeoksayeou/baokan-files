Time Fell Behind
	Zhang Jing Jin Huifeng

　　At 4:40 in the morning, the rumbling sound of explosions had just subsided at the end of the rock tunnel in the Quan Tai vertical shaft. The faint light of over twenty miners' lamps still flickered in the tunnel, and the shaft-sinking workers were already starting their "work break meeting" during this interval.

　　Small team leader Zhao Chuansheng checked his watch and said, "Comrades, there's only one hour and twenty minutes left before the end of the shift. After deducting ten minutes for clearing the smoke, can we complete another cycle?"

　　The team had already completed four cycles today. Completing another cycle in the remaining seventy minutes was an almost unimaginable speed! But as soon as Zhao Chuansheng finished speaking, Deng Congyin, a fifth-grade driller nicknamed "Tiger on the Mountain," shouted, "We guarantee it, let's go!" He stood up and was about to run inside, facing the smoke. Zhao Chuansheng quickly stopped him: "Wait, first tell us how you plan to do it!"

　　Zhao Chuansheng's team is a small team under Wu Xiulun's large team in the Quan Tai work area of Xuzhou Shaft-Sinking Company. Wu Xiulun's large team won two national championships in monthly progress and average progress in shaft construction last year, and won the Coal Ministry's Rocket Red Banner. This year, they are determined to set new records in rock tunnel excavation. Zhao Chuansheng, Yang Duowen, and Zhang Xiangde's three small teams launched a heated competition, and no one was willing to let go of even a second.

　　Now, Zhao Chuansheng's team quickly made new combat arrangements. Each type of worker made mutual guarantees. Deng Congyin said: "As long as the supports keep up, I guarantee to drill all the holes without delaying the blasting." Chu Qingran, a support worker nicknamed "Dragon in the Water," immediately responded: "The supports will definitely keep up, I guarantee your safety, just work with peace of mind!" Loading machine operator Sheng Jibao said: "I guarantee to load the drilling bits in forty minutes." Zhao Chuansheng asked him: "Who are you competing with?" Before Sheng Jibao could answer, trammer Zhao Hongsheng interjected: "However fast the loading machine loads, I'll haul it out just as fast, I guarantee no derailments." Zhao Hongsheng is known as the "Flying Tram" in the team, pushing the cars quickly and without derailments. Zhao Chuansheng was overjoyed: "Good, transfer the 'Flying Tram' over here to compete with Sheng Jibao!"

　　As soon as the time arrived, all the workers rushed to their work locations, eager to get started.

　　Deng Congyin was the first to arrive. This twenty-four-year-old young man is a tough guy, and he always drills more holes than others. The team leader's mobilization filled him with energy. He picked up the pneumatic drill, and, bang, bang, bang, he drilled straight into the rock. The hard rock seemed to soften a bit when it met this "Tiger," and in the blink of an eye, the bit was already deep in the rock core.

　　Sheng Jibao's loading machine moved violently and rhythmically back and forth, clattering as it loaded scoop after scoop of rock into the mine cars. The "Flying Tram" Zhao Hongsheng and Wang Xiaozhong immediately pushed the loaded mine cars out quickly.

　　Chu Qingran, chopping supports with an axe, seized the fifty-second interval while the loaded car was going out and the empty car had not yet returned, and nimbly jumped next to the loading machine to prop up one of the support legs. In the second fifty-second interval, he propped up another support leg on the opposite side. In the third fifty-second interval, he and his assistant Mao Zaixu carried pit props, jumped onto the top of the loading machine, and, each holding one end, erected crossbeams on the support legs. His movements were so fast that it was like a magic trick. In this brief moment, Chu Qingran squatted, leaped, rose, and fell, and every movement was so accurate and skilled, truly like a "Dragon in the Water," and became a perfectly matched pair with Deng Congyin, the "Tiger on the Mountain."

　　The battle was becoming more and more intense. Twelve people used six pneumatic drills simultaneously to drill holes in the face, which was only five square meters in area. Four people carried two short-bit drills on their shoulders to drill the top holes, four people used long-bit drills to reach in between their legs to drill the bottom edge holes, and the other four people lay on the ground to drill the middle bottom holes. The noise of the pneumatic drills was deafening. At this time, Zhao Chuansheng, having finished loading explosives into the top blast holes, was working with Chu Qingran, who had finished supporting the roof, to drill the top holes. Zhao Chuansheng pressed the pneumatic drill against his stomach, untied the handkerchief from his neck, took out his watch wrapped inside, and saw that only the last five minutes remained. He quickly handed the watch to Zheng Yulong and Li Congfa, who were crawling on the ground drilling holes. The former was the team's renowned "Zhuge Liang," and the latter was a sixth-grade worker with the most meticulous and down-to-earth work ethic. If they indicated they were confident, success was almost guaranteed. The watch flashed before their eyes, Zheng Yulong's mouth revealed a smile, and Li Congfa turned his head and pressed his whole body against the pneumatic drill. Zhao Chuansheng felt even more confident after seeing their expressions.

　　In these last five minutes, six tasks were carried out simultaneously with great intensity: laying track, loading explosives, drilling side bottom holes, processing supports, connecting compressed air pipes, and connecting ventilation ducts. When the last two minutes arrived, the holes were drilled, the air pipes were connected, and people began to load explosives into the drill holes and urgently pack up their tools. Suddenly, Zhao Chuansheng's drilling bit was firmly stuck in the drill hole, and he couldn't get it out. Chu Qingran, in a hurry, swung his sledgehammer and hit the drilling bit once. Four people went up and pulled hard, and only then did they manage to pull the bit out.

　　At six o'clock this morning, Cheng Mao, a trade union cadre in the work area, was awakened from his sleep by a series of rapid knocks on the door. At the same time, someone whispered, "Old Cheng, get up, get up, go write a report of good news!"

　　Cheng Mao recognized the voice of Sun Xiushan, the duty dispatcher, and knew that Zhao Chuansheng's team must have created a new record. He sat up in a single motion and responded, "I'm going right now." Then he said, "Hurry up and call up the comrades from the amateur band." At this time, Yuan Houkun, the party branch secretary sleeping on the bed to the north, also woke up and said to Cheng Mao, who was getting dressed, "You go first, I'll get up right away."

　　The workers from Zhao Chuansheng's team came up from the mine laughing and joking. The sky was already bright, and a fresh breeze blew from the green fields. The achievement of advancing 8.5 meters made everyone's heart blossom with joy. When they reached the locker room, Yuan Houkun was already waiting for them. He shook Zhao Chuansheng's hand with a beaming smile, and said to the workers, "Take a shower quickly, everyone is waiting to congratulate you!"

　　The meeting room was filled with workers who had changed into clean clothes, and the table was filled with Da Qianmen cigarettes specially prepared for them by the trade union. But instead of accepting congratulations first, they seriously started their post-shift meeting.

　　Zhao Chuansheng stood up and said, "Everyone did very well today. However, we cannot be arrogant with our achievements. Now let's check to see what shortcomings there are."

　　The atmosphere in the meeting room suddenly became serious. The first to speak was the electrician, Old Niu. He pointed out that although Sheng Jibao did very well, he often drove the loading machine onto the rock at the front of the track, which could easily damage the machine and could also affect overall operations. Sheng Jibao then made a sincere self-criticism. Trammers Wang Xiaozhong, Zhang Xueqing, and Zhao Hongsheng all criticized Bai Yongxing for failing to push the cars out in a timely manner three times. Because he did not abide by collective discipline, he delayed the time for loading rock at the face, ninety seconds each time, three times totaling two hundred and seventy seconds. This time could have allowed six pneumatic drills to drill one hole each simultaneously. Then, Li Congfa compared the operating time of the first cycle and the last cycle, and after careful calculation, he found that the former took fifteen minutes longer than the latter. He said, "If we could all work with the energy and methods of the last cycle, the speed would be even faster!"

　　Time is so precious to them! They never let go of even a second's mistake. This is the tradition of the workers of Wu Xiulun's large team, and they are moving forward in this constant examination of shortcomings.

　　After the meeting, the news reporting team waiting next door began to beat the gongs and drums with deafening intensity, and the meeting room became lively again...

　　时间掉队了
　　张竞　金惠风
    清晨四时四十分，隆隆的爆炸声在权台竖井的岩巷尽头刚刚响过，二十多道镀灯的微光还在岩巷里交错晃动着，建井工人们便趁这个空隙开起“工间会”来。
    小班班长赵传胜看了看表说：“同志们，离下班只有一小时二十分钟了，除去吹炮烟十分钟，还能再干一个循环吗？”
    小班今天已经干过了四个循环，要在余下的七十分钟再走一个循环，这简直是难以想像的速度啊！可是赵传胜的话刚落音，绰号“上山猛虎”的五级打眼工邓从印就嚷道：“咱们保证啦，进！”说着站起来，迎着炮烟就要向里跑。赵传胜连忙喝住他：“等等，你先把怎么干的办法拿出来！”
    赵传胜班是徐州建井公司权台工区吴修伦大班的一个小班。吴修伦大班曾在去年的井筒工程中夺得了月进度和平均进度两项全国冠军，荣获了煤炭部的火箭大红旗。今年，他们又决心在岩巷掘进上再创新纪录，赵传胜、杨多文和张祥德三个小班展开了热烈的竞赛，谁也不肯放过一分一秒的时间。
    现在，赵传胜小班迅速作出了新的战斗部署。各个工种互相提保证。邓从印说：“只要棚子跟上，我保证把眼打齐，不误放炮。外号
  “水中蛟龙”的扶棚工褚庆然马上应道：“棚子一定跟上，保证你安全，放心干吧！”装岩机手盛继宝说：“我保证四十分钟装完钎子。”赵传胜问他：“你和谁赛？”盛继宝还没有回答，推车工赵洪生接口道：“装岩机装多快，我就出多快，保证不误车皮。”赵洪生是班里出名的“飞车”，推起车来又快又不掉道。赵传胜听了满心欢喜：“好，把‘飞车’调过来，和盛继宝赛！”
    时间一到，全班工人都争先恐后地跑到了工作地点。
    邓从印抢在最前面。这个二十四岁的年轻小伙子，是个硬汉子，打起眼来总要比别人多打个把。班长的动员令，把他全身的劲儿都鼓足了，端起风钻，哒哒哒，直向岩层里打。坚硬的岩石遇到这个“猛虎”，也好像软了三分，眨眼之间，钎子已经深深地钻进了岩心。
    盛继宝操纵的装岩机，猛烈而有规律地前后返复爬动着，哗啦啦地把一斗斗岩石装进矿车。“飞车”赵洪生和王孝忠立即飞快地把装满岩石的矿车推出去。
    用斧头砍削着棚架的褚庆然，乘着重车出去，空车尚未进来的五十秒钟的间隙，敏捷地跳到装岩机旁，支起了一根棚腿。第二个五十秒钟又在对面支起了另一根棚腿，到第三个五十秒钟，他又和助手毛在序扛起坑木，跳上装岩机顶，一人拿住一头，在棚腿上架起了横梁，动作之快，简直像玩魔术一样。在这短暂的瞬间，褚庆然蹲跃起落，每个动作都是那么准确、熟练，真如“水中蛟龙”，和“上山猛虎”邓从印，恰恰成了旗鼓相当的一对。
    战斗越来越紧张了。十二个人使着六台风钻同时在只有五平方公尺面积的迎头打眼。四个人在肩上扛着两台短钎风钻分打顶部的邦眼，四人用长钎风钻从他们的腿裆里伸进去打底部的边眼，另外四个人俯伏在地上打中部底眼。哒哒哒的风钻声振耳地响成一片。这时候，在顶炮眼里装完了炸药的赵传胜，正和扶完了棚子的褚庆然合打邦眼，赵传胜用肚子顶住风钻，从颈项里解下手帕，拿出包在里面的手表，一看，时间只剩下最后的五分钟了。他连忙把手表递给爬在地上打眼的郑玉龙和李从法看，前者是班里出名的“诸葛亮”，后者是工作最细致踏实的六级工，什么事情只要他们表示有把握，十九就可成功。手表在他们眼前晃过，郑玉龙嘴角露出了笑容，李从法则是一扭头，用全身的力量向风钻压去，赵传胜看了两个人的表情，心里更加落实了。
    在这最后的五分钟里，钉道、装药、打边底眼、加工棚子、接压风管和接风筒等六项作业同时紧张进行。等到最后两分钟眼子打齐，风管接好，人们开始在钻眼里装炮药和紧急收拾工具的时候，赵传胜的钎子忽然牢牢地卡在钻眼里，怎么也拿不出来了。褚庆然一急，抡起大锤就往钎子上砸了一下，四个人上去使劲一拔，才把钎子拔了出来。
    这天早晨六点钟，工区工会干部程茂在睡梦中猛听得一阵急促的叩门声，同时有人轻声喊道：“老程，起来起来，快写喜报去！”
    程茂听出来这是值班调度员孙秀山的声音，知道一定是赵传胜班创造了新纪录，便一骨碌坐起来应道：“就去”。紧接着又说：“你快去把业余乐队的同志都叫起来。”这时候睡在北边铺上的党总支书记袁厚坤也醒了，对正在穿衣的程茂说：“你先去，我马上起来。”
    赵传胜班的工人嘻嘻哈哈地从井下上来，天色已经大亮，清风从碧绿的田野上吹来。班进八点五公尺的成绩，使每个人的心里都乐开了花。到了更衣室，袁厚坤已在那里等候他们了，他满面笑容地握住赵传胜的手，一面对工人说：“快洗澡，大家都等着给你们贺喜哩！”
    会议室里坐满了换上干净衣服的工人，桌上摆着工会特为他们准备的大前门香烟。可是他们不是先接受祝贺，而是认真地开起班后会来。
    赵传胜站起来说：“今天大家都干得很好。但是，我们有成绩也不能骄傲。现在先检查一下，看看还有那些缺点。”
    会场的空气顿时变得严肃起来。第一个发言的是电工老牛，他指出盛继宝虽然干得很出色，但是他经常把装岩机开到轨道前头的底岩上去，这样容易损坏机器，也可能影响整体作业，跟着，盛继宝也作了诚恳的检讨，推车工王孝忠、张学庆和赵洪生都批评了白永兴三次没有及时向外推车的事情。因为他不遵守集体的纪律，延误了迎头装岩的时间，一次九十秒钟，三次就是二百七十秒，这些时间，几乎可供六部风钻同时各打一个眼。接着，李从法又把第一个循环和最后一个循环的作业时间作了对比，仔细一算，前者比后者多用了十五分钟，他说：“如果咱们都能以最后一个循环的劲头和方法去干，速度还会更快！”
    时间对于他们是多么宝贵！即使一分一秒钟的过失，他们也从不放松。这是吴修伦大班工人的传统，他们就是在这样不断检查缺点中前进的。
    会议结束后，等在旁边的报喜队敲起了震天响的锣鼓，会议室又变得热闹起来……
