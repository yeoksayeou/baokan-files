    The "Twelve Unifications" System for Collaborative Transportation Between Benxi Road Factories
    In the grand collaboration between the railway department and factories and enterprises in Benxi City, a "Twelve Unifications" system was established. The content of this system is:

    1.  Unified Thinking: The transportation department must resolutely serve production, and factories and enterprises must also create favorable conditions for the transportation department to jointly ensure production and jointly complete transportation tasks.

    2.  Unified Pickup and Delivery: Break the restrictions that railway locomotives and factory locomotives cannot enter each other's tracks. Railway locomotives directly deliver freight cars to factory areas, and factory-owned locomotives also directly deliver freight cars to railway stations, reducing the dwell time of vehicles at the transfer lines.

    3.  Unified Signals: The signals and signs used by railway vehicles and factory vehicles are all based on railway signals and signs as the standard.

    4.  Unified Analysis: Railways and factories jointly maintain an analysis ledger, use unified form calculation methods, and create unified shift plans and stage plans.

    5.  Unified Labor Allocation: The loading and unloading forces of the railway, the factory transportation department, and various production factories and mines are uniformly allocated according to needs.

    6.  Unified Joint Labor Competition: Organize railway and factory employees to carry out collaborative competitions in joint labor.

    7.  Unified Shifts: All railway and factory personnel related to transportation are changed to a three-shift system.

    8.  Unified Freight Dispatch: Railway freight dispatchers and dispatchers from the transportation departments of factories and mines work together in the same office.

    9.  Unified Transfer Procedures: The railway and the factory jointly establish an account book, delivering and receiving goods as they arrive and depart.

    10. Unified Indicators: Railways and factories both use railway transportation technical indicators as the basis, mobilizing employees to jointly guarantee completion.

    11. Unified Planning: Railways and factories jointly formulate daily and shift transportation plans, combined with production and sales units.

    12. Unified Vehicle Technical Inspection: Abolish the technical inspection system for vehicles on transfer lines and establish a credit transfer system. (Xinhua News Agency)

    本溪路厂协作运输的“十二统一”制度
    本溪市铁路部门和工厂企业开展大协作中，建立了“十二统一”制度。这个制度的内容是：
    一，统一思想：运输部门必须坚决为生产服务，工厂企业也必须给运输部门创造有利条件，共同保证生产，共同完成运输任务。
    二，统一取送：打破铁路机车、工厂机车、不互相驶入对方轨道的限制，铁路机车把货车直接送到工厂区，工厂自用的机车也直接把货车送到铁路车站，减少车辆在交接线的停留时间。
    三，统一信号：铁路车辆和工厂车辆使用的信号、号讯，都以铁路的信号、号讯为标准。
    四，统一分析：铁路、工厂共同掌握一个分析台帐，统一表格计算方法，统一做班计划和阶段计划。
  五，统一劳力调配：铁路、工厂运输部以及各生产厂矿的装卸力量，根据需要统一调配。
    六，统一联劳大竞赛：组织铁路、工厂职工，开展联合劳动的协作竞赛。
    七，统一班次：铁路、工厂凡与运输有关的人员一律改为三班制。
    八，统一货调：铁路的货运调度员与厂矿企业运输部的调度员在一起联合办公。
    九，统一交接手续：铁路、工厂双方共立一本账，随到随交，随出随接。
    十，统一指标：铁路、工厂都以铁路的运输技术指标为依据，发动职工共同保证完成。
    十一，统一计划：铁路、工厂共同在一起制订日、班运输计划，并与生产、销售单位相结合。
    十二，统一车辆技术检查：取消车辆在交接线的技术检查制度，建立信用交接制度。（新华社讯）
