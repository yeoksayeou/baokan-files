Visiting the Echeng Xishan Base
By our reporters Cao Baoming and Guo Shenrong

Built a Complete Industrial System

When the magazine "Red Flag" published the experience of the Xuguang No. 1 Cooperative of Echeng, Hubei Province, in establishing biogas stations and motorized mills on July 1st last year, Echeng County had only two grain processing factories and a small coal kiln producing a few tons of briquettes (for domestic use) per day. Now, in less than a year, the county has built a small coal and iron base capable of producing iron, steel, and steel products. Furthermore, with this base as the center, it has established a coking plant capable of recovering tar, a refractory brick factory, three machinery manufacturing plants, and eleven commune farm tool factories, forming a "complete" industrial system in the county.

The distribution of this coal and iron base is quite interesting. The steel plant is located on Xishan Mountain next to the county seat. Halfway up the mountain is an open-pit mine with reddish-brown ore, and at the foot of the mountain are workshops roaring with wind and emitting wisps of white smoke. These include ore crushing, iron smelting, steelmaking, steel rolling, wire drawing, and nail making facilities. Ten kilometers along the highway and one or two kilometers along a small road leads to the Bishi Ferry Coal Mine, which has eight pairs of coking coal shafts. The coking plant, refractory brick factory, and machinery factories are located in the city and along the nearby highways and railways, with extremely convenient transportation. These factories and mines are within the Wuhan-Daye power grid and have ample power supply. In the first quarter of this year, they produced more than 10,000 tons of coking coal, more than 1,000 tons of iron, more than 40 tons of steel, and more than 300 tons of refractory bricks. The vast majority of these were used to support key national factories, and the remainder was used to make various machines and farm tools to support agricultural production. Currently, these factories and mines are still under construction. The Xishan Iron and Steel Plant, which already has two small modern blast furnaces, is installing three more small modern blast furnaces (the largest with a volume of 28 cubic meters), two converters, and a belt forging hammer. The coking plant is building five more No. 2 simple coking ovens. The Bishi Ferry Coal Mine is also rushing to repair roads and design railways in order to transport large quantities of prime coking coal and blending coal.

The Story of Iron and Coal

Echeng is extremely rich in iron ore. In the mountains of Xishan, Leishan, and Chengchao, large areas of reddish-brown ore bodies are exposed everywhere. According to historical records, Sun Quan of the Three Kingdoms once mined iron and steel here to "make a thousand swords and ten thousand knives, each three feet and nine inches long." Han Yu's father, Han Zhongqing, also engaged in large-scale smelting here during the Tang Dynasty, "cooking and smelting, the numbers reaching hundreds of millions." Residents also say that Yue Fei of the Southern Song Dynasty once mined iron here to make weapons. But it is unknown when iron smelting was lost in Echeng. Echeng had not produced a single pound of iron for many years. It was not until July of last year, when the entire people started making steel, that Deputy County Chief Jin Fenglin and Industry Bureau Chief Fang Zifang went to Sanlicheng in Dawu and Huashan in Wuchang to learn iron smelting technology, and the first furnace of fire was lit in the county. Immediately afterward, more than 6,000 iron smelting furnaces were erected around Xishan, making Xishan red day and night. This enabled Echeng, which needed to import 600 to 700 tons of iron every year, to export more than 2,800 tons of iron last year to support key factories.

However, the coking coal they used at that time was all transported from Fengfeng in Hebei and Shuangyashan in Heilongjiang. This coking coal, which cost only ten yuan or so per ton at the mine, became more than seventy yuan per ton in Echeng after being transported several times by train, ship, and truck, greatly increasing the cost of pig iron. At the same time, mobilizing all the county's vehicles and ships for transportation often could not meet the needs of production. Whether or not coking coal could be found nearby became the key to the development of steel production in Echeng.

Could Echeng County have coking coal? As early as 1877, the British mining engineer Guo Shidun made a judgment on the coal reserves in Hubei: "The coal seams are too thin, the coal quality is poor, and there is no value." After Zhang Zhidong's failure to mine coal at Wangsanshi in Daye and Tuditang in Wuchang, the argument that "Hubei has no industrial coal" circulated in the industrial community for decades. In May of last year, Wang Baocheng and Yu Xingfa, who had been miners for more than 20 years, reported to the county: "Capitalists used to open two pairs of coal shafts at Bishi Ferry. The coal here can be used to make iron and forge iron, and it is coking coal." In order to verify this news, Fang Zifang, the director of the county industry bureau, crossed the river three times to the Huanggang Special District and asked an engineer to conduct an on-site survey. The engineer's conclusion was still that it was worthless.

In September of last year, Gao Shoupeng, deputy director of the county industry bureau, went to Bishi Ferry again to conduct coking experiments. As a result, the coal seam at the Bishi Ferry Coal Mine became thicker and thicker as it was dug, and the coal quality also became better and better. Of the eight pairs of shafts they opened, five pairs of shafts produced prime coking coal, and three pairs of shafts produced blending coal, and the coal seams were between six inches and one meter thick (prime coking coal seams only four inches thick have mining value), and the thickest even reached two meters. According to Ren Ziheng, Director of the Hubei Provincial Bureau of Fuel Industry, the coal reserves here are estimated to be about 50 million tons, and the production scale can reach 500,000 tons of coking coal per year. This will not only meet the needs of steel production in the county, but also help the neighboring Hubei Iron and Steel Plant and many counties in the Huanggang Special District solve a big problem. In the first quarter of this year, more than 300 tons of coke were produced using coal from here, and the coke strength was very good.

From Indigenous to Modern

At the beginning of this year, the coal and iron base faced a new situation: the vast majority of the labor force had to be transferred back to the countryside to participate in agricultural production. The Xishan Iron and Steel Plant went from more than 10,000 people to 6,000 people, then to 2,400 people, and then to more than 800 people, but they had to produce 8,500 tons of iron, 1,000 tons of steel, and 700 tons of steel this year, which was a huge task. The 1,600 people in the Bishi Ferry Coal Mine will not be reduced, but the output will increase from more than 8,000 tons last year to 130,000 tons. At the same time, it is also required that the product quality be good and the cost be low.

How can these requirements be met?

On the one hand, under possible conditions, they try to arm this coal and iron base with modern equipment as much as possible, such as building modern blast furnaces and converters in steel plants, installing ore crushers, and widening narrow roadways in coal mines, installing steam winches and water pumps, using electricity for ground and underground lighting, and using electricity as the power for drainage, blowing, and mechanical operation.

On the other hand, according to the insufficient conditions of indigenous equipment, they mobilize the masses to make suggestions and use various "indigenous" methods to transform indigenous equipment to achieve "four highs and one low" (high yield, high quality, high labor efficiency, high lifespan, and low cost). At the Xishan Iron and Steel Plant, workers devised ways to install slides and wooden rails between the mining area, the ore crushing workshop, and the blast furnace. The mined ore slides all the way to the ore crushing workshop, and then is sent to the blast furnace in small carts, which can replace the heavy labor of 120 workers every day. At the same time, a series of transformations were carried out on the indigenous furnaces. They used small motors and some wooden boards and hemp ropes to make automatic feeding machines. After the raw materials that have been weighed are loaded into wooden boxes, they go up to the top of the furnace along the wooden rails of the inclined bridge and are poured into the furnace. In this way, the three-shift feeding workers for one furnace are reduced from 18 to 3. Coal gas is drawn from the top of the furnace to burn a hot blast stove to make the indigenous furnace hot blast. The ore is pre-screened and classified, and baked next to the hot blast stove to reduce the coke ratio. The No. 9 indigenous furnace, which was transformed earliest, has a utilization coefficient of 1.1, and 90% of the quality is gray iron.

At the Bishi Ferry Coal Mine, workers also installed wooden rails in the flat roadways of the No. 3 and No. 4 shafts, bamboo skin slides on the forks, and wooden winches at the shaft openings. In this way, the mined coal slides down the slide, then is pushed by small carts, and lifted out of the shaft by wooden winches. These improvements have been enthusiastically welcomed by the coal miners underground.

    鄂城西山访基地
    本报记者　曹葆铭　郭慎容
    建起了一套工业
    “红旗”杂志去年7月1日刊登湖北省鄂城旭光一社举办沼气站、机动磨等的经验时，鄂城全县还只有两个粮食加工厂和一个日产数吨柴煤（生活用煤）的小煤窑。现在，还不到一年，这个县就建起了一个小型煤铁基地，能出铁，出钢，出钢材。并且还以这个基地为中心，办起了能回收焦油的炼焦厂和耐火砖厂，办起了三个机械制造厂和十一个公社农具厂，使县里的工业形成了“一套”。
    这个煤铁基地的分布挺有意思。钢铁厂设在县城旁边的西山，半山腰是红赭色的露天采矿场，山脚下便是响着呜呜风吼和冒着缕缕白烟的车间，其中有碎矿、炼铁、炼钢、轧钢、拉丝和制钉等。沿公路走十公里，再走小路一、二公里，便到了拥有八对焦煤井的碧石渡煤矿。炼焦厂、耐火砖厂、机械厂等设在城里和邻近的公路和铁路两旁，交通极为方便。这些厂矿处在武汉大冶电力网之内，有充足的电源。他们今年第一季度共生产了一万多吨焦煤、一千多吨铁、四十多吨钢和三百多吨耐火砖，绝大部分都用来支援了国家重点工厂，剩余部分用来制成各种机械和农具，支援了农业生产。目前，这些厂矿还在继续建设。已有两座小洋高炉的西山钢铁厂，正在安装三座小型洋高炉（最大的容积是二十八立方公尺）、两座转炉和一台皮带锻锤。炼焦厂正在建设五座二号简易炼焦炉。碧石渡煤矿也正在赶修公路、设计铁路，以便把大量的主焦煤、配焦煤赶运出来。
    铁和煤的故事
    鄂城的铁矿极为丰富。在西山、雷山和程潮的群山，到处都裸露着大片大片的红赭色矿体。据志书记载，三国孙权曾经采这里的钢铁
  “作千口剑，万口刀，各长三尺九寸”。唐朝韩愈的父亲韩仲卿也曾在这里大搞冶炼，做到“且烹且烁，数盈万亿”。居民们也传说南宋岳飞曾在这里采铁制作兵器。但不知从何时起，炼铁竟在鄂城失传了。鄂城多少年来都不出一斤铁。直到去年7月，全民大办钢铁开始，副县长靳凤林和工业局长方子房先后去大悟三里城、武昌花山，学回炼铁技术，全县才升起了第一炉红火。紧接着，西山周围就竖起了六千来座炼铁炉，照得西山日夜通红。这就使每年都需要调进六、七百吨铁的鄂城，在去年调出了二千八百多吨铁去支援重点工厂。
    但是，他们当时用的焦煤，都是远从河北峰峰、黑龙江双鸭山运来的。这些出矿价格才十多元一吨的焦煤，经过乘火车、坐轮船、搭汽车，几次转运，到鄂城就成了七十多元一吨，使生铁成本大大增加。同时，动员了全县的车辆、船只赶运，也时常供不上生产的需要。能不能就近找到焦煤？就成了鄂城发展钢铁生产的关键。
    鄂城县里能有炼焦煤吗？远在1877年，英国矿师郭师敦就给湖北的煤藏下了个断语：“煤层过薄，煤质不良，无什价值。”当张之洞在大冶王三石、武昌土地堂采煤失败后，“湖北无工业用煤”的论调，就在工业界流传了几十年。去年5月，作了二十多年矿工的王宝成、余兴发向县里反映：“过去资本家在碧石渡开过两对煤井。这里的煤能化铁、锻铁，是焦煤。”为了证实这个消息，县工业局长方子房三次过江到黄冈专署，请了一位工程师，到现场勘察。这位工程师的结论仍然是无什价值。
    去年9月，县工业局副局长高寿彭又到碧石渡进行炼焦的试验。结果，碧石渡煤矿的煤层越挖越厚，煤质也越挖越好。他们开了八对井，就有五对井出主焦煤，三对井出配焦煤，而煤层都在六公寸至一公尺之间（主焦煤的煤层四公寸就有开采价值），最厚的还达到两公尺。据湖北省燃料工业厅长任子衡研究认为这里的煤藏量大约有五千万吨左右，生产规模可达到年产五十万吨焦煤。这样，不仅能满足本县钢铁生产的需要，还能帮助邻近的湖北钢铁厂和黄冈专区许多县解决很大问题。今年第一季度用这里的煤炼了三百多吨焦炭，焦炭强度很好。
    由土到洋
    今年一开年，这个煤铁基地又面临一个新的情况：绝大多数的劳动力都要调回农村，参加农业生产。西山钢铁厂就由原来一万多人降为六千人，再降为二千四百人，再降为八百多人，而他们今年却要生产八千五百吨铁、一千吨钢、七百吨钢材，任务很大。碧石渡煤矿的一千六百人不减少，但产量却要从去年的八千多吨升到十三万吨。同时还要求产品质量好，成本低。
    怎样才能达到这些要求呢？
    他们一方面在可能条件下，尽量用洋设备武装这个煤铁基地，如在钢铁厂建设洋高炉、转炉，安装碎矿机；在煤矿改窄巷道为宽巷道，安装蒸汽卷扬机和水泵，用电作地面和井下照明，作排水、鼓风和机械运行的动力，等等。
    另一方面是，根据土设备不足的条件，发动群众人人献计，用各种“土”办法来改造土设备，做到“四高一低”（高产、高质、高工效、高寿命和低成本）。在西山钢铁厂，工人们设法在采矿场——碎矿车间——高炉之间安装了滑丝和木轨。采出的矿石就一直滑到碎矿车间，再用小车送到高炉，可以代替每天一百二十名工人笨重劳动。同时在土炉上进行了一系列的改造。他们用小马达和一些木板、麻绳制成了自动上料机，过好磅秤的原料装入木盒后，就沿着斜桥的木轨上到炉顶，倒入炉里。这样一个炉子的三班上料工人，就由十八人减为三人。从炉顶引出煤气燃烧热风炉，使土炉热风化；把矿石事前筛选分类，并在热风炉旁进行烘烤，以降低焦比。改造最早的九号土炉，利用系数已达到一点一，质量90％是灰口铁。
    在碧石渡煤矿，也由工人们分别在三号、四号井的平巷里安上木轨，上岔道安上竹皮滑道，井口安上木制绞车。这样，采出来的煤就由滑道滑下来，再由小车推送、用木绞车提出井口。这些改进，受到井下挑煤工人的热烈欢迎。
