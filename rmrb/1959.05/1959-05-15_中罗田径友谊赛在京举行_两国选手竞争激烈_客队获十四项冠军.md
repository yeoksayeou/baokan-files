Xinhua News Agency, May 14th: The renowned world record holder in women's high jump, Romania's Iolanda Balaș, cleared a height of 1.80 meters in Beijing this afternoon, setting the world's best performance in women's high jump this year. This achievement is only three centimeters short of her own world record of 1.83 meters set on October 18th last year.

    Balaș achieved this outstanding result during the first friendly competition between the Romanian national men's and women's track and field team and the Chinese men's and women's track and field team. In the women's high jump competition, former world record holder Zheng Fengrong only cleared 1.65 meters due to a foot injury, taking second place.

    Today, the Romanian men's track and field team achieved first place in eight out of eleven events. The Chinese men's track and field team won first place in the 200 meters, 110 meters hurdles, and pole vault. The Romanian women's track and field team won first place in six out of eight events. The Chinese women's track and field team won first place in the 80 meters hurdles and discus throw.

    Today's friendly competition was held at the Xiannongtan Stadium. The wonderful performances of both sides frequently won warm applause from the tens of thousands of spectators. The track races in today's friendly competition between the Romanian and Chinese track and field athletes were particularly competitive. In the women's 100 meters, both Romania's Lucha and China's Liu Xingyu achieved a time of 12.4 seconds. Lucha took first place due to being slightly faster in touching the finish line.

    However, in field events, especially throwing events, the Romanian athletes won with significant advantages in the women's javelin, shot put, and men's javelin, shot put, and hammer throw, except for Shi Baozhu, who won first place in the women's discus.

    In today's friendly competition, three Chinese athletes broke the national records for the men's 1500 meters and women's shot put. These three athletes are: Li Henian and Wang Zhixiang, who broke Chen Youcai's 1957 national record of 3 minutes 59.8 seconds in the men's 1500 meters with times of 3 minutes 57.8 seconds and 3 minutes 59.4 seconds, respectively. Xian Shaomei also broke her own national record of 13.62 meters in the women's shot put with a throw of 13.83 meters.

    The Romanian national men's and women's track and field team will leave Beijing on May 15th to visit Shenyang, with a second friendly competition scheduled for May 18th in Shenyang. On May 22nd and 25th, they will also hold friendly competitions in Tianjin and Jinan, respectively. (Attached photo)

    中罗田径友谊赛在京举行
    两国选手竞争激烈　客队获十四项冠军
    新华社14日讯　著名的女子跳高世界纪录保持者、罗马尼亚的巴拉斯，今天下午在北京跳过了一公尺八十公分的高度，创造了今年以来世界女子跳高的最好成绩。这个成绩同她自己去年10月18日创造的一公尺八十三公分的世界纪录，只差三公分。
    巴拉斯今天是在罗马尼亚国家男、女田径队同中国男、女田径队举行第一次友谊比赛时，创造这一优异成绩的。在女子跳高比赛中，前世界纪录创造者郑凤荣因脚受伤，只跳过一公尺六十五公分，取得第二名。
    罗马尼亚男子田径队今天在十一项比赛中，取得了八项第一名，中国男子田径队在二百公尺、一百一十公尺高栏和撑竿跳高三项比赛中获得第一名；罗马尼亚女子田径队在八项比赛中获得了六项第一名，中国女子田径队赢得了八十公尺低栏和铁饼两项比赛的第一名。
    今天的友谊比赛，是在先农坛体育场举行的。双方的精彩表演，不时博得上万名观众的热烈掌声。罗、中两国的田径选手今天在径赛项目的友谊比赛中，争夺比较激烈。女子一百公尺，罗马尼亚队的露查和中国队的刘兴玉，成绩都达到了十二秒四，露查因触终点白线的动作稍快一点，取得了第一名。
    但是，在田赛特别是投掷项目方面，中国队除了石宝珠赢得女子铁饼第一名外，其他在女子标枪、铅球和男子标枪、铅球、链球等比赛中，罗马尼亚选手都以很大优势获胜。
    在今天的友谊比赛中，有三名中国选手打破了男子一千五百公尺和女子铅球的全国纪录。这三名选手是：李贺年和王致祥分别以三分五十七秒八和三分五十九秒四的成绩，打破了陈有才在1957年创造的男子一千五百公尺三分五十九秒八的全国纪录。冼少梅也以十三公尺八十三公分的成绩，打破了她自己保持的十三公尺六十二公分的女子铅球全国纪录。
    罗马尼亚国家男、女田径队5月15日将离北京去沈阳访问，预定5月18日在沈阳举行访华的第二次友谊比赛。5月22日和25日，他们还将分别在天津和济南举行友谊比赛。（附图片）
