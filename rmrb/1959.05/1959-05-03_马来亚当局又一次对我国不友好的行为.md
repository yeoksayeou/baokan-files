    The Malayan Authorities' Yet Another Unfriendly Act Towards Our Country
    Commentator of this newspaper
    On March 28, the Malayan government published a so-called White Paper on "The Threat of Communism to the Federation of Malaya." In this 32-page White Paper, the Malayan government, in addition to repeating the cliché of "the threat of international communism," used a large amount of space to slander our country, insisting that our country is carrying out subversion in Malaya. This is another extremely unfriendly act by the Malayan government towards the Chinese people.
    The Malayan government has continuously clamored that China is carrying out subversive activities in Malaya, but they have never been able to produce, nor can they possibly produce, any factual basis. In this White Paper, the Malayan government ingeniously took our country's publishing, news, and broadcasting undertakings and the correspondence between returned overseas Chinese and their relatives and friends abroad (i.e., the personal contacts referred to in the White Paper) as a basis for slandering our country. It even quoted extensively from our country's policies on publishing, news, and broadcasting as evidentiary material. This shows that, in order to slander our country, the Malayan government has resorted to clumsy methods of irrelevant association and far-fetched interpretations. If people remember that, not long ago, the Malayan government even described China's classical literary novels as "subversive books from Communist China" and banned their import, they can see how absurd the Malayan government's basis for slandering our country's subversive activities is!
    Anyone with a little common sense knows that it is the imperialist groups headed by the United States, not others, that are carrying out subversive and infiltration activities in Southeast Asian countries, including Malaya. The Malayan government has never said a word about the subversive and infiltration activities of imperialism, but under the instigation and provocation of imperialism, it has fabricated a large number of unfounded lies to slander the Chinese people, who have always sympathized with and supported the national independence movements of Southeast Asian countries. This kind of reversal of black and white cannot deceive the Malayan people and the people of Southeast Asian countries.
    The Chinese people have always attached importance to developing traditional trade and cultural ties with the Malayan people based on the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and have made unremitting efforts for this purpose. The Malayan government has not only failed to make any contribution to promoting the ties between the two peoples, but has repeatedly obstructed the development of relations between the two countries. Recently, the Malayan government has taken a series of unfriendly actions towards China, such as restricting and discriminating against trade between our country and Malaya, expelling large numbers of overseas Chinese, and forcing the closure of the Bank of China's institutions in Malaya. Now, the Malayan government is even wantonly slandering our country in officially published documents. This kind of behavior by the Malayan government, which runs counter to the wishes of the Chinese and Malayan people and is not in line with the national interests of Malaya, is being increasingly criticized and dissatisfied with by the Malayan people. In the spirit of consistent friendship with the Malayan people and solidarity and cooperation among Asian countries, the Chinese people hope that the Malayan government can change its unfriendly attitude towards our people.

    马来亚当局又一次对我国不友好的行为
    本报评论员
    马来亚政府在3月28日发表了一份所谓“共产党对于马来亚联合邦的威胁”的白皮书。马来亚政府在这份长达三十二页的白皮书中，除了重复甚么“国际共产主义的威胁”的滥调外，还使用了大量篇幅对我国进行诬蔑，硬说我国正在马来亚进行颠复活动。这是马来亚政府又一次对中国人民极不友好的行为。
    马来亚政府曾不断叫嚷中国对马来亚进行颠复活动，但他们从来举不出、也不可能举出任何符合事实的根据。在这次发表的白皮书中，马来亚政府竟别出心裁，把我国的出版、新闻、广播事业和归国华侨同海外亲友的通信（即白皮书中所指的个人接触）作为诬蔑我国的根据，而且还连篇累牍地摘录我国有关出版、新闻、广播工作的方针作为引证材料。这说明，马来亚政府为了诬蔑我国，已不惜采用东拉西扯、牵强附会的拙劣手法。人们如果再想到，不久以前，马来亚政府把中国的古典文艺小说都说成是“来自共产党中国的颠复性书籍”而禁止入口，就更可以看出，马来亚政府诬蔑我国进行颠复活动的依据是多么荒谬绝伦！
    稍具有常识的人都知道，对东南亚国家，包括马来亚在内，进行颠复和渗透活动的不是别人，而是以美国为首的帝国主义集团。马来亚政府对帝国主义的颠复和渗透活动从来未置一词，却在帝国主义的指使和挑拨下，编造大量毫无根据的谎言来诽谤一贯同情和支持东南亚各国民族独立运动的中国人民，这种颠倒黑白的叫嚷是欺骗不了马来亚人民和东南亚各国人民的。
    我国人民一向重视根据和平共处的五项原则发展同马来亚人民的传统的贸易和文化联系，并为此作了不懈的努力。马来亚政府不但没有为增进两国人民的联系作出任何贡献，反而一再阻挠两国关系的发展。最近一个时期，马来亚政府采取了限制和歧视我国同马来亚的贸易，驱逐大批华侨出境，迫使中国银行在马来亚的机构停业等一系列对中国不友好的行为，现在马来亚政府竟又在官方发表的文件中对我国大肆诬蔑。马来亚政府这种同中马两国人民的愿望背道而驰，不符合马来亚民族利益的行为，正遭到马来亚人民日益广泛的指责和不满。本着对马来亚人民一贯友好和亚洲国家团结合作的精神，中国人民希望马来亚政府能够改变对我国人民不友好的态度。
