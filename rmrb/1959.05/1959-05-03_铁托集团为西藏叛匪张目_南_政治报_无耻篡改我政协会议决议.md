Xinhua News Agency, May 2nd dispatch from Belgrade: The Yugoslavian "Politika" published a New China News Agency dispatch dated April 29th, which concerned the resolution passed by the First Session of the Third National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), but unscrupulously tampered with its contents using deceptive tactics.

The newspaper altered the phrase in the New China News Agency report that "The Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference strongly condemned the armed rebellion launched by the original Tibetan local government and the upper-strata reactionary clique, in collusion with imperialists and foreign interventionists, to betray the motherland" into "The National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference condemned the armed uprising in Tibet. The uprising was ‘launched by the former Tibetan government and upper-strata elements together with imperialists and foreign interventionists’."

Here, one can see that "original Tibetan local government" lost the word "local" and became "former Tibetan government"; "upper-strata reactionary clique" lost the words "reactionary clique" and became "upper-strata elements"; in the phrase "armed rebellion to betray the motherland," "rebellion" was turned into "uprising," and the words "to betray the motherland" were deleted. In addition, when this newspaper reprinted the New China News Agency report that "the resolution strongly condemned certain expansionist elements in India...", it changed "Indian expansionist elements" to "certain individuals in India."

It is worth noting that this message, which has been completely distorted after these alterations, is published under the New China News Agency heading. This kind of disregard for journalistic ethics reflects how impatiently the Yugoslav revisionists are doing their utmost to support the treasonous crimes of the Tibetan reactionaries and foreign interference in our internal affairs.

    铁托集团为西藏叛匪张目
    南“政治报”无耻篡改我政协会议决议
    新华社2日讯　贝尔格莱德消息：南斯拉夫“政治报”4月30日以新华社电头发表4月29日新华社广播的一条关于中国人民政治协商会议第三届全国委员会第一次会议通过政治决议的消息时，竟采用偷天换日的手法，篡改上述消息的内容。
    这家报纸把新华社消息中所说“中国人民政治协商会议强烈地谴责了原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团勾结帝国主义和外国干涉者所发动的背叛祖国的武装叛乱”改成了“中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会谴责了西藏的武装起义。起义是
  ‘前西藏政府和上层分子协同帝国主义者和外国干涉者一起发动的’”。
    在这里，人们可以看到“原西藏地方政府”没有了“地方”字样，变成了“前西藏政府”；“上层反动集团”没有了“反动集团”字样，变成了“上层分子”；在“背叛祖国的武装叛乱”一语中，把“叛乱”说成是“起义”，并且删去了“背叛祖国”字样。此外，这家报纸在转载新华社消息中所说的“决议强烈地谴责了印度某些扩张主义分子……”时，把“印度扩张主义分子改为“印度某些人士”。
    值得注意的是，经过这些篡改已面目全非的消息是冠以新华社的电头的。这种不顾新闻道德的手法，反映了南斯拉夫修正主义分子是多么迫不及待地为支持西藏反动集团的叛国罪行和外国干涉我国内政而尽力。
