Xinhua News Agency, 30th -- The Chinese People's Liberation Army, while completing combat, training and other tasks, has vigorously developed agricultural and sideline production. Many units have achieved total or substantial self-sufficiency in meat, vegetables, chickens, ducks, fish, and other items.

According to preliminary statistics from units in the Beijing area, this year they cultivated more than 66,500 mu of land, an increase of 17% compared to last year, with an 80% increase in paddy fields. They accumulated 350,000 tons of fertilizer, applying an average of over 10,000 jin of fertilizer per mu. They raised more than 55,000 pigs, an increase of 18% compared to the end of last year, and also raised a number of sows and boars, laying the foundation for self-breeding and self-raising. At the same time, the units also raised nearly a thousand head of cattle, more than 30,000 sheep, more than 18,000 chickens and ducks, and more than 710,000 fish, adapting to local conditions. Units in the Nanjing area harvested nearly six million jin of vegetables in the first quarter of this year, nearly three times more than in the same period last year. In addition to the more than 4,600 pigs already slaughtered, the existing number is more than 30% higher than at the end of last year, and the number of poultry and fish raised has also increased by two to four times compared to last year. In addition, they planted more than 360,000 fruit trees, opened more than 390 workshops, and established 54 farms.

This year, the agricultural and sideline production of the troops has been carried out under the personal leadership of Party committees at all levels. In addition to repeated mobilization and deployment last winter and this spring, the Party committee and leading organs of the troops in the Beijing area also specifically convened a production meeting in late April, formulating fifteen regulations for agricultural and sideline and industrial production. General Yang Yong encouraged everyone at the meeting to work hard in production and strive to achieve total self-sufficiency in non-staple foods within two to three years. At the production meeting and on-site production meeting held by the Logistics Department of the Nanjing area troops, units with outstanding production achievements were commended, advanced experiences were promoted, and short-term training courses were held to impart production knowledge and technology.

Since the beginning of spring, the troops have been in high spirits for production and full of energy. Many troops have not only achieved "garden-style management" on large areas of land, but also planted green vegetables everywhere on river banks, field edges, and in front of and behind houses. Some have opened canals and wells in barren wasteland, achieving a bumper harvest of vegetables. Under the slogan of "adapting to local conditions and relying on self-reliance," the troops stationed on a certain island on the coastal defense front worked together, collecting fifty-two kinds of pig feed in the mountains and catching 200,000 jin of fish and shrimp in the sea. The three million kelp plants they cultivated have also grown to two or three meters high. The Ninth Company of a certain unit on the Fujian front, stationed on a green stone mountain, the soldiers carried soil up from the foot of the mountain, one basket at a time, and piled it on the stones to grow vegetables. Many troops in border areas have greatly increased the area planted with vegetables this year. A certain cavalry unit of the Xinjiang Military Region reclaimed 1,000 mu of wasteland this year. In addition to planting a large amount of vegetables to ensure self-sufficiency in vegetables, they also planted 400 mu of grain and 400 mu of alfalfa, striving for self-sufficiency in military grain and horse grass. On Ximeng Mountain in Yunnan, at an altitude of 2,400 meters, the garrison troops achieved a bumper harvest of green vegetables last year in a "barren land". This year, they have opened up more vegetable fields, determined to achieve total self-sufficiency in meat and vegetables. On the northern Tibetan plateau, at an altitude of more than 4,000 meters, a certain cavalry unit is also vigorously developing production in the past "barren land," harvesting more than 50,000 jin of cabbage and turnips. Due to the soldiers' deep plowing and meticulous cultivation, many high-yield fields have emerged this spring. The spinach planted by a certain unit in the Beijing area yielded an average of 18,000 jin per mu. The spring cabbage planted by the Changde Military Sub-district Office in Hunan yielded an average of more than 7,000 jin per mu. (Attached picture)

A certain unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army has its own pig herds, cattle herds, and sheep flocks in each company. This year, they raised a total of more than 8,500 pigs, more than 300 cattle, and more than 200 sheep.

    解放军农副业生产大发展
    许多部队作到肉、菜、鸡、鸭、鱼全部或大部自给
    新华社30日讯　中国人民解放军在完成战斗、训练等任务的同时，大力发展了农副业生产。不少部队作到了肉、菜、鸡、鸭、鱼等全部或大部分自给。
    北京地区部队初步统计：今年种地六万六千五百多亩，比去年增加了17％，其中水田增加了80％；积肥三十五万吨，平均每亩施肥万斤以上；养猪五万五千多头，比去年年终增加18％，并且养了一批母猪、公猪，为自繁自养打下了基础。同时，各部队还因地制宜地饲养了近千头牛，三万多只羊，一万八千多只鸡、鸭，七十一万多尾鱼。南京地区部队今年第一季度收获的蔬菜近六百万斤，比去年同期增加近三倍，猪除已宰的四千六百多头以外，现有的比去年年底增加30％以上，养的家禽和鱼类也比去年增加了两倍到四倍。此外，他们还种植了果树三十六万多棵，开设作坊三百九十多个，兴办农场五十四个。
    今年部队的农副业生产是在各级党委亲自领导下开展起来的。北京地区部队党委和领导机关，除了去冬今春反复作了动员布置以外，4月下旬还专门召开了生产会议，制定出农副业及工业生产规定十五条。杨勇上将在会上鼓励大家努力生产，争取在两三年内达到副食品全部自给。南京地区部队后勤部举行的生产会议和生产现场会议上，表彰了生产成绩优异的单位，推广了先进经验，并举办短期训练班，传授生产知识和技术。
    各部队入春以来，生产情绪昂扬，干劲充沛。许多部队不仅在大面积土地上，实现了“园田化”，还在河埂田边，房前屋后遍种青菜。有的在贫瘠的荒地上，开渠打井，获得蔬菜丰收。驻在海防前线某岛上的部队，在“因地制宜，自力更生”的口号下，官兵一齐动手，在山里采集到五十二种猪饲料，下海捕到二十万斤鱼虾，他们养殖的三百万株海带也长到二、三公尺高了。福建前线某部九连，驻守在青石山上，战士们从山下把土一筐筐地担上来，堆到石头上种菜。许多边疆地区的部队，今年种菜面积大为增加。新疆军区某骑兵部队，今年开垦荒地一千亩，除大量种菜，保证菜类自给以外，还种了四百亩谷物、四百亩苜蓿，争取军粮、马草自给。在海拔二千四百公尺的云南西盟山上，驻守部队去年在“不毛之地”获得青菜丰收，今年他们开辟了更多菜田，决心肉菜全部自给。在海拔四千多公尺的藏北高原上，某骑兵部队也在过去“不毛之地”大搞生产，收获白菜、蔓菁五万多斤。由于战士们深耕细作，今春出现了许多高产田。北京地区某部种的菠菜，平均亩产一万八千斤。湖南常德军分区机关种的春白菜，亩产平均七千斤以上。（附图片）
    中国人民解放军某部每个连队都有自己的猪群、牛群和羊群。他们今年共饲养了八千五百多口猪、三百多头牛和二百多只羊。
