Go Among the Masses to Invite "Zhuge Liang"
By our reporter Li Yuxiu

    In the vast fields of Taigu County, Shanxi Province, the wheat waves roll, shimmering with golden light. With immense joy, the commune members are intensifying the final stages of wheat management, striving to ensure that every stalk grows more fully. The county has sown a total of 310,000 mu of winter wheat, and fertilizer has been applied universally once, with 260,000 mu fertilized twice or more. Among these, 150,000 mu of irrigated wheat have been watered once universally. Recently, the county committee issued a new call: wage a two-week battle to complete "two universal applications" (universal topdressing and universal watering), "three preventions" (prevent lodging, prevent pests and diseases, prevent frost damage), and "two crash efforts" (crash efforts on third-class wheat and high-yield demonstration plots)! The county’s 45,000-strong wheat field management army is full of energy and high morale, fighting to realize the county committee's call. An old man, nearly sixty, pointed to the boundless and lush wheat and told the reporter: "With such good wheat, how can people not be happy!"

    The spring sowing work throughout the county is drawing to a close. This year, the cotton planting area has expanded by 20% compared to last year, and oil crops have increased by 29.5%. The planting plans for grain crops have also been completed. The characteristics of this year's spring planting are: good preparation, fast progress, and high quality. Various advanced planting methods have been universally promoted throughout the county, with over 50% of crops adopting "nest planting" and concentrated fertilization methods. Currently, the county is carrying out a campaign of "no idle land anywhere, everyone harvests an extra hundred jin of grain." The edges of fields, embankments, roadsides, canals, graves, and vacant lots are all being planted with crops. The commune members happily say, "Plow more slopes in the spring, eat more cornbread in the fall."

    Why is agricultural production in Taigu County showing such a vibrant and vigorous scene this year? The reporter interviewed Comrade Guo Zhenshan, the first secretary of the county committee. This young but experienced secretary in rural work introduced many experiences and leadership methods adapted to this year's new situation. These experiences and methods ultimately boil down to following the mass line.

    In January of this year, Guo Zhenshan and Zhang Dinggao, the county committee's secretary for agriculture, went to several communes, including Dongguan, Jialing, and Qixianzhen, to inspect work. They listened to the reports of the commune cadres and discovered a common problem: the reported materials were not specific. At the same time, they found that the "bureaucratic" work style of the communes was very serious, with many cadres going to the countryside during the day but returning at night, not going deep enough. While working alongside commune members, they observed that labor efficiency was low and there was a lack of concrete leadership and planning. Based on these two aspects, Comrade Guo Zhenshan convened symposiums with commune cadres and commune members. At the meetings, a large amount of material showed that cadres from the county to the commune and management area level generally lacked a deep and practical work style. The key to the formation of this situation was a lack of a system of responsibility. During the symposiums, many measures to strengthen the responsibility system of leaders at all levels were proposed.

    After Comrade Guo Zhenshan returned to the county committee office, he extensively exchanged opinions with the county committee secretaries, committee members, and office cadres. Then, he raised the suggestions for improving work style at a county committee meeting for full discussion. Finally, the county committee made a decision to implement a "five-level chain responsibility system."

    The so-called "five-level chain responsibility system" means that from the county to the work team (county, commune, management area, production team, work group), from planting to harvesting, responsibility is assigned down the line for target setting, measures, technology, mobilizing the masses, and income distribution. The entire county extracted fourteen county committee secretaries, members, county heads, ministers, and thirty-three bureau-level cadres to take charge of the eleven communes; one hundred and fifty-eight commune party secretaries and directors took charge of one hundred and fifty-eight management areas; nine hundred and forty-eight management area branch secretaries and directors took charge of six hundred and seventy-five production teams; more than two thousand production team leaders and deputy leaders took charge of more than three thousand groups; and the commune members of each production group were assigned to manage 600,000 mu of large-area high-yield fields and 300,000 mu of general fields. Several months of experience have proven that the "five-level chain responsibility system" has eight major benefits: 1. The work style of leaders at all levels has become more practical and in-depth; 2. The sense of responsibility of cadres and commune members has been strengthened; 3. The enthusiasm of cadres to participate in labor has increased; 4. The enthusiasm of the masses of commune members has been boosted; 5. Problems are discovered and solved more timely; 6. The relationship between cadres and the masses has been further strengthened; 7. It has promoted cadres to learn scientific technology and production knowledge; 8. It has promoted the collaboration between all levels.

    The development of things always means that when old contradictions are resolved, new contradictions emerge. In April, when Comrade Guo Zhenshan went to Houcheng Commune, his area of responsibility, one morning, he was spreading manure with the commune members in the Fourth Production Team and found that four commune members lacked motivation. During the break, Guo Zhenshan asked them: "Dare you compete with the Third Team?" The other party replied: "We will work hard, why compete?" When Comrade Guo Zhenshan told the commune party secretary about this sentiment, the party secretary said: "After the wheat jointing stage, the competition cooled down." After extensive discussions with commune cadres and careful discussions at the county committee meeting, Comrade Guo Zhenshan made the decision to "launch a five-level high-yield model competition campaign." The county committee unified the specific standards for model commune members, model work groups, model production teams, model management areas, and model communes. It was stipulated that model commune members, model work groups, and model production teams would be selected every month; model management areas would be selected every two months; and model communes would be selected every quarter. This movement has extremely broad mass participation. There are collectives, individuals, cadres, and masses participating. The direction in the competition is clear, the goals are concrete, there are banners at every level, and "pacesetters" everywhere. Not only will it not make the competition movement degenerate into formalism, but it will also promote the movement to advance wave after wave. Since the launch of the five-level high-yield model competition movement, Taigu County's agricultural production has shown a new situation of being lively, colorful, everyone striving to be a model, every commune striving to be the best, red flags being planted everywhere, and the entire county being full of red. According to the results of the county's first evaluation in late April, there were thirty-seven model management areas, one hundred and twelve model production teams, two hundred and fifteen model work groups, more than seven thousand model commune members, and more than four hundred model cadres. The number of people in the county attending work increased by 15.6% compared to before, and labor efficiency increased by 18.5%. Recently, Comrade Guo Zhenshan, based on the situation learned in Hucun Commune, after holding symposiums with production team, management area, and commune cadres, and exchanging opinions with several county committee secretaries and committee members, planned to hire thirteen "Zhuge Liangs" in the eleven communes as consultants for the county committee secretariat. The county committee will invite them to participate and express their opinions when discussing major issues. In addition, each county committee secretary and member will have to contact five to seven "Zhuge Liangs" in their area of responsibility as their consultants. Communes and management areas must also implement the method of inviting "Zhuge Liangs" as consultants. Party committees at all levels must take methods such as inviting people up, going down themselves, and writing letters to establish close and frequent contact with these "Zhuge Liangs" so that they can often hear the voices of the masses.

    At the end of the interview, the first secretary of the county committee told the reporter: "For the first secretary, the most important thing is to constantly discover and propose new problems, and summarize and promote new experiences based on the new situation. To do this, we must study more (learn from the experiences of local and other places, the instructions of higher-level party committees, and humbly learn from the masses), research more (research with people up, down, left, and right, and give full play to the collective leadership of the county committee and the division of labor of the secretaries), and go deeper (go deep into the grassroots, deep into the masses, and deep into the fields). If we can truly concentrate the wisdom of the entire county's masses, all our work will be invincible."

    到群众中请“诸葛亮”
    本报记者  李玉秀
    山西太谷县广阔的田野上，麦浪滚滚，金光闪闪，社员们怀着无限喜悦的心情，加紧小麦的后期加工，要让每一株小麦生长得更饱满。这个县总共种了三十一万亩冬小麦，已经普遍追了一次肥，有二十六万亩追肥两次以上，其中十五万亩水地小麦，已经普浇一次。最近，县委又提出新的号召：大战两周，完成两普（普追肥、普浇）、三防（防倒伏、防病虫害、防霜冻）、两突击（突击三类小麦和高额丰产田小麦）！全县四万五千人组成的麦田管理大军，人人精神充沛，个个斗志昂扬，为实现县委的号召而战斗。一位年近花甲的老大爷指着一眼望不到边生长旺盛的小麦告诉记者：这样好的麦子，怎么能叫人不高兴呢！
    全县的春播工作正在扫尾。今年的棉花播种面积比去年扩大20％，油料比去年扩大了29.5％，粮食作物也完成了种植计划。今年春播的特点是：准备好，进度快，质量高，全县普遍推广了各种先进的种植方法，有50％以上的作物都采取了“窝种”和集中施肥的方法。现在，全县正在开展一个“到处无闲地，每人多收百斤粮”运动。地边、地堰、路旁、渠道、坟地、空地都要种上庄家。社员们高兴地说：“春天多刨个坡坡，秋天多吃个窝窝。”
    太谷县今年的农业生产为什么表现出生气勃勃，生龙活虎的景象呢？记者访问了这个县的县委第一书记郭振山同志。这位年轻的，但是富有农村工作经验的书记介绍了许多适应今年新的形势所提出的经验和领导方法。这些经验和方法，归根到底是走群众路线。
    今年1月，郭振山和县委农业书记张鼎高去东观、贾令、祁县镇等几个公社检查工作，他们听取了社干部的汇报，发现了一个普遍的问题：汇报的材料都不具体。同时，他们发现公社的“机关化”作风很严重，许多干部都是白天下乡，晚上就回来，不深入下去。他们在同社员一起劳动中，看到劳动效率不高，也缺乏具体领导和计划。根据这两方面情况，郭振山同志召集了社干部、社员座谈。会上，大量的材料说明，从县到公社、管理区，干部普遍缺乏深入踏实的作风。形成这种情况的关键是缺乏责任制。座谈当中，大家还提出了许多加强各级领导责任制的办法。
    郭振山同志回到县委机关以后，同县委书记、县委委员、办公室的干部广泛地交换了意见；然后，把改进作风的意见提到县委会议上进行了充分的讨论。最后，县委做出了推行“五级连环责任制”的决定。
    所谓“五级连环责任制”，是从县到作业小组（县、公社、管理区、生产队、作业组），从种到收，实行包指标、包措施、包技术、包发动群众、包收益分配，分级负责到底。全县抽出十四个县委书记、委员、县长、部长和三十三个科局长级干部，分别包干十一个公社；一百五十八个公社党委书记、主任等干部，包干一百五十八个管理区；九百四十八个管理区总支书记、主任等，包干了六百七十五个生产队；二千多个生产队长、副队长、包干了三千多个小组；各个生产组的社员，分工包干六十万亩大面积丰产田和三十万亩一般田。几个月的经验证明，“五级连环责任制”有八大好处：一、各级领导干部作风踏实、深入了；二、干部和社员的责任心加强了；三、提高了干部参加劳动的积极性；四、鼓起了社员群众的干劲；五、发现问题和解决问题更加及时；六、进一步密切了干部和群众的关系；七、促进了干部学习科学技术和生产知识；八、促进了上下左右的协作。
    事物的发展总是旧的矛盾解决了，新的矛盾又出现了。4月份，郭振山同志在他的责任区——候城公社下乡时，一天上午，他在第四生产队和社员一块儿撒粪，发现有四个社员干劲不足。休息下来，郭振山便问他们：你们敢不敢和三队比一比？对方答复说：我们好好劳动就行了，何必比呢？当郭振山同志把这种情绪告诉公社党委书记的时候，党委书记说：过了小麦拔节关以后，竞赛就冷下去了。郭振山同志经过和社干部广泛地交谈并且在县委会议上仔细讨论，做出了“开展五级丰产模范竞赛运动”的决定。县委统一提出模范社员、模范作业小组、模范生产队、模范管理区、模范公社的具体标准。规定每月评选一次模范社员，模范作业小组和模范生产队；两月评选一次模范管理区，每季评选一次模范公社。这个运动，具有极广泛的群众性。参加的有集体，有个人，有干部，有群众。竞赛中方向明确，目标具体，层层有旗帜，处处有“标兵”。不但不会使竞赛运动流于形式，而且会促使运动一浪推一浪步步前进。五级丰产模范竞赛运动开展以来，太谷县的农业生产便出现了生动活泼、有声有色、人人争模范、社社争上游、处处插红旗、全县满堂红的新局面。据4月下旬全县首次评比结果，出现模范管理区三十七个，模范生产队一百一十二个，模范作业组二百一十五个，模范社员七千多人，模范干部四百多人，全县的出勤人数较前增加15.6％，劳动效率提高18.5％。最近，郭振山同志又根据在胡村公社了解的情况，经过生产队、管理区、公社干部座谈，并且和几个县委书记、县委委员交换了意见，计划在全县十一个公社聘请十三名“诸葛亮”当参谋，做为县委书记处的“参谋”。县委讨论决定重大问题，请他们参加发表意见。此外，县委书记、委员每人都要在自己的责任区联系五至七个“诸葛亮”作为自己的参谋。公社、管理区也都要实行请“诸葛亮”当参谋的办法。各级党委都要采取请人上来、自己下去、写信等等方法同这些“诸葛亮”取得密切的经常的联系，以便自己经常听到群众的声音。
    在访问结束的时候，这位县委第一书记告诉记者：对于第一书记说来，最重要的是根据新的形势，不断地发现和提出新的问题，总结和推广新的经验。要做到这一点，就要多学习（学习本地外地的经验、上级党委指示，还要虚心向群众学习）、多研究（和上下左右的人研究，充分发挥县委集体领导和书记分工的作用）、多深入（深入基层，深入群众，深入田间）。如果真正能够把全县群众的智慧集中起来，一切工作就会无往而不胜。
