Albania Advances on the Socialist Road
Alternate Member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Party, Ramiz Alia

This November, the Albanian people will celebrate the 15th anniversary of the liberation of their motherland. The whole country is greeting this festival with tremendous achievements and victories. Since the people seized power, under the wise leadership and education of the Albanian Labor Party, the working people of our country have carried out resolute and great reforms over the past fifteen years. The achievements of Albania's socialist construction clearly demonstrate what kind of cause can be accomplished when the people master their own destiny and when a liberated people, under the leadership of a party loyal to Marxism-Leninism, struggles for a happy life and a bright future! The Labor Party has tapped the inexhaustible strength and enormous talents of the masses and mobilized all of this to serve socialist construction. The victories achieved by our people also demonstrate the strength of proletarian internationalism forged by the countries of the socialist camp headed by the great Soviet Union, and the great role of the strong fraternal cooperation and selfless mutual assistance of socialist countries. For us Albanians, as the Party teaches us: it is as clear as the sun at midday that without the Soviet Union, without the help of the glorious Soviet army in the Second World War, it would have been impossible to obtain freedom and independence. Without the great, selfless, and fraternal assistance of, first of all, the Soviet Union, the great People's Republic of China, and other socialist countries, Albania could not have achieved such brilliant achievements in socialist construction. The achievements made by the Albanian people in the past fifteen years clearly demonstrate that an important condition for building socialism is infinite loyalty to Marxist-Leninist ideology, and to fighting for the purity of Marxism-Leninism, against the bourgeoisie and its loyal servants—modern revisionists. Yugoslav revisionists, who embody the quintessence of revisionism, are agents of U.S. imperialism and deadly enemies of Marxism and socialism.

Fifteen years ago, Albania was one of the most backward countries in Europe, with almost no industry, extremely feudal and backward agriculture, more than 85% of the population illiterate, no institutions of higher learning, no theaters, and no cultural centers. After liberation, under the wise leadership of the Labor Party, Albania took on a completely new look. Our country is rapidly advancing on the road of socialism. Formerly, Albania was a backward agricultural country, but today it has become an advanced agricultural-industrial country. Thanks to the selfless labor of the Albanian people and the generous assistance of the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and other socialist countries, Albania has established a young and modern industry. Our mining industry, especially oil production, is developing rapidly, and the electric power industry is also growing. Now the cloth, shoes, sugar, etc., needed by our people can be met by the products of our factories. Our food industry is increasingly producing a large number of products for the people. Albania's current industrial production is more than sixteen times higher than in 1938 before the war. This figure is enough to illustrate the general situation of our industrial development. We can boldly say that our young socialist industry already plays a leading role in the entire national economy and has laid the foundation for further development of our industry and other sectors of the national economy. If calculated per capita, Albania has already left some countries behind in some industrial sectors. For example, in 1957, Albania's electricity was 18% more than Turkey's; coal was 4.7% more than Italy's and 30% more than Greece's; oil was eleven times more than Italy's and thirteen times more than Yugoslavia's; chromium was nineteen times more than Greece's, fifteen times more than Yugoslavia's, and twice as much as Turkey's; textiles were 150% more than Turkey's, 25% more than Greece's, and 14% more than Yugoslavia's.

In the struggle to build socialism, the Labor Party has paid close attention to the socialist transformation of agriculture, realizing a thorough revolution in the economic system that has existed in the countryside for thousands of years, and fundamentally changing the lives and thoughts of the peasants who make up the vast majority of our population. To complete this transformation, the line of individual farmers voluntarily joining agricultural cooperatives was implemented. This is the only correct path, which has long been confirmed by the experience of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries. The road of agricultural cooperativization has enabled these countries to get rid of agricultural backwardness, develop productive forces, eradicate the roots of the emergence and revival of capitalist elements, ensure the supply of raw materials necessary for industry and the supply of agricultural products to urban residents, and reduce the heavy physical labor of peasants and improve their material and cultural living standards.

Today, in Albania, the area of cultivated land that has joined advanced agricultural cooperatives accounts for 76% of the country's cultivated land. Thanks to the hard work of the working farmers and the vigorous assistance of the state, great achievements have also been made in agriculture in the fifteen years since the establishment of the people's power. Our agriculture is increasingly becoming a powerful, mechanized agriculture, and is constantly providing more products for the market. The area of cultivated land in our country increased by 72% in 1958 compared with 1938, and the irrigated area increased by two times compared with before the war. People remember that in 1938, there were only thirty-five tractors on our land, but now we have nearly three thousand tractors, two hundred and sixteen combine harvesters, and many other agricultural machines. The Labor Party pays special attention to the development of animal husbandry. Although animal husbandry was severely damaged by the war, the number of various livestock has now reached and exceeded pre-war levels.

The Albanian Labor Party constantly cares about the development of agriculture. Agricultural issues are the focus of many important resolutions of the Party Central Committee plenary sessions. The Third Congress of the Party put forward a fundamental task to our peasants: to ensure that our country is self-sufficient in food by 1960. In order to achieve this major task, the working people of our country have mobilized all their forces. 1959 is a decisive year for gloriously fulfilling this task put forward by the Party. The work carried out so far and the state of agricultural cultivation show that all the possibilities for successfully completing the above tasks exist.

Among the achievements of Albania's struggle for socialist construction, the achievements in education and culture occupy an important position. As in other socialist countries, the famous Marxist thesis that socialism is the only social system that makes culture, science, and art the wealth of the broad masses, a system that guarantees the vigorous development of the people's talents and creative power, and can cultivate new people with lofty human qualities, has been fully demonstrated in our country.

Under the leadership of the Party, a socialist revolution is also being carried out victoriously in our country in culture and thought. By 1955, our country had eliminated illiteracy among people under the age of forty. Since 1946, comprehensive compulsory primary education has been implemented for the first time. Now, seven-year compulsory education is being promoted in many cities and rural areas. The network of general schools and vocational schools has been greatly expanded, and night schools and correspondence schools have also grown significantly. Our country established national universities, higher agricultural colleges, normal colleges, and scientific research institutions for the first time under the people's power. Today in Albania, compared with 1938, the number of schools and students has increased by three and a half times, and the number of teachers has increased by five times. One out of every six citizens in our republic is studying in a regular school. If we compare the data from our country in recent years, there are one hundred and sixty-six students per thousand residents, while there are only one hundred and fifty-three in Greece, one hundred and twenty-six in Italy, one hundred and twenty-seven in Yugoslavia, and eighty-five in Turkey. Similarly, great achievements have been made in the fields of art, culture, and literature. In the past, it would have been unthinkable for Albania to have an opera and ballet theater, a film studio, a drama theater, a national song and dance troupe, a variety theater, and its own art films, opera works, etc. All of this has become a reality in the people's Albania, on the advancing socialist road of Albania under the wise leadership of the Labor Party.

The Party's highest goal is to continuously improve the lives of the working masses. There is no doubt that the above achievements have also brought about tremendous changes in this regard.

Our people have overcome countless difficulties and hardships to achieve these achievements in their unwavering struggle. The correct line of the Party, the selfless labor of the masses, and the selfless assistance of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries are the main factors for our country's progress. The immortal ideas of Marxism-Leninism and the ideas of proletarian internationalism have inspired the Albanian people on the road of socialist construction. The steel-like unity and great achievements of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union have strengthened the strength of our people in the struggle to overcome difficulties and enemies. In this regard, the great victories and amazing achievements made by the great, fraternal Chinese people have aroused enthusiastic reactions among our workers and peasants. The leaping advance of the fraternal People's Republic of China in all aspects inspires the Albanian people to strive for new victories. We, the members of the Albanian Labor Party delegation, have visited China for a few days, and we have personally seen how this great country has changed under the leadership of the glorious Chinese Communist Party. How talented its outstanding people are, they have pure feelings and a great heart. How friendly, respectful and affectionate the Chinese people are to the people of our small country. We are fully convinced that this visit will not only help to further consolidate the unbreakable friendship between our two countries within the great socialist camp, but also help our Labor Party to learn from the extremely rich experience of the Chinese Communist Party. During our few days in China, we have seen more clearly the power of the great ideas of Marxism-Leninism, which unites us as eternal friends, and we have seen how solid the socialist camp is and how correct the relations established between the socialist countries are.

The enemies of socialism and their Yugoslav lackeys are trying to split our countries, slander our ideals, and sabotage the construction of our socialist countries. The Yugoslav revisionists are deadly enemies of socialism, and they have been insidiously and unscrupulously opposing socialist countries in the past and are doing so now. The Yugoslav revisionists have long opposed Albania, always wanting to destroy this country and trying to turn our country into a colonial-style "seventh republic." They oppose our country with political sabotage, the most despicable provocations, espionage, and other activities, just like capitalist countries. The Yugoslav revisionists will still suffer a shameful defeat in the future, just like in the past. Albania will stand still like a rock now and in the future, and will make all enemies, including the Yugoslav revisionists, break their heads. As our people say: Albania is not a small country with 1.5 million people, but a great power with 900 million people. Albania is an inseparable member of the great socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union. Our folk proverb says it well: "The dog barks behind, the caravan continues to move forward." We say, let the enemies daydream, let the Yugoslav revisionists draw cakes to satisfy their hunger, socialism cannot be stopped, it is marching victoriously and will win victory all over the world.

    阿尔巴尼亚在社会主义道路上前进
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党中央委员会政治局候补委员　拉米兹·阿利雅
    今年11月，阿尔巴尼亚人民将要庆祝祖国解放十五周年。全国正以巨大的成就和胜利迎接这个节日。自从人民取得政权以来，在阿尔巴尼亚劳动党英明的领导和教育下，十五年来，我国劳动人民进行了坚决伟大的改革。阿尔巴尼亚社会主义建设所获得的成就清楚地表明：当人民掌握了自己的命运，当一个已经解放了的人民在忠实于马克思列宁主义的党的领导下，为争取幸福生活和美好未来而斗争的时候，就会做出怎样的事业来！劳动党发掘了群众的取之不尽的力量和巨大的才能，并把这一切调动起来为社会主义建设服务。我国人民所取得的胜利还表明了以伟大苏联为首的社会主义阵营各国所结成的无产阶级国际主义的力量，表明了社会主义国家坚强的兄弟般的合作和无私的互助的伟大作用。对于我们阿尔巴尼亚人来说，正如党教导我们的：如果没有苏联，没有光荣的苏军在第二次世界大战中给我们帮助，是不能获得自由和独立的，这就像白天里的太阳一样清楚。阿尔巴尼亚如果没有首先是苏联、伟大的中华人民共和国和其他社会主义国家巨大、无私和兄弟般的援助，就不可能在社会主义建设中获得如此辉煌的成就。阿尔巴尼亚人民十五年来所获得的成就清楚地表明了：建设社会主义的重要条件是对马克思列宁主义思想无限忠诚，是为维护马克思列宁主义的纯洁性，向资产阶级及其忠诚的仆从——现代修正主义者进行斗争。南斯拉夫修正主义者集修正主义之大成，是美帝国主义的代理人，是马克思主义和社会主义的死敌。
    十五年前，阿尔巴尼亚是欧洲最落后的国家之一，工业几乎一无所有，农业极端封建落后，85％以上的人口是文盲，全国没有一所高等学校，没有一个剧院和文化馆。解放后，在劳动党的英明领导下，阿尔巴尼亚的面貌焕然一新。我国正迅速地在社会主义道路上迈进，从前阿尔巴尼亚是一个落后的农业国，今天已经成为一个先进的农业—工业国。由于阿尔巴尼亚人民忘我的劳动，由于苏联、中华人民共和国和其他社会主义国家的大公无私的帮助，阿尔巴尼亚已经建立了年轻的、现代化的工业。我国的采矿业，首先是石油生产正飞速发展，电力工业也正在成长。现在我国人民所需要的布匹、皮鞋、食糖等可以由我国工厂的产品来满足。我国的食品工业日益为人民生产出大量的产品。阿尔巴尼亚现在的工业生产比战前1938年提高了十六倍以上，这个数字足以说明我国工业发展的一般情况。我们可以大胆地说，我国年轻的社会主义工业已经在整个国民经济中起着领导作用，并为进一步发展我国工业和发展国民经济的其他部门打下了基础。如果按人口平均计算，阿尔巴尼亚在一些工业部门上已经把一些国家抛在后面了，例如1957年阿尔巴尼亚的电力比土耳其多18％；煤炭比意大利多4.7％，比希腊多30％；石油比意大利多十一倍，比南斯拉夫多十三倍；铬比希腊多十九倍，比南斯拉夫多十五倍，比土耳其多两倍；纺织品比土耳其多150％，比希腊多25％，比南斯拉夫多14％。
    在为建设社会主义的斗争中，劳动党十分注意农业的社会主义改造，实现了农村中千百年来经济制度的彻底革命，使占我国人口绝大多数的农民的生活和思想得到根本的改变。为了完成这一变革，实行了个体农户自愿加入农业合作社的路线，这是唯一正确的道路，早为苏联和其他社会主义国家的经验所证实。农业合作化的道路使我们这些国家摆脱了农业落后的状况，发展了生产力，铲除了资本主义成分产生和复活的根源，保证了对工业必需的原料供应和对市民的农产品供应，并减轻了农民的沉重体力劳动和提高他们的物质和文化生活水平。
    今天，在阿尔巴尼亚，加入高级农业社的耕地面积占全国耕地的76％，由于劳动农民的辛勤劳动和国家的大力帮助，在人民政权建立的十五年来，在农业上也取得了巨大的成就。我们的农业正日益成为强大的、机械化的农业，正不断为市场提供更多的产品。我国耕地面积1958年同1938年比较增加了72％，灌溉面积同战前相比增加了两倍。人们记得，1938年，在我国土地上只有三十五台拖拉机，而现在我们已有近三千台拖拉机、二百一十六台联合收割机和其他许多农业机器了。劳动党特别关心畜牧业的发展。虽然畜牧业受到了战争的严重摧残，但各种牲畜的数目目前都已达到和超过了战前水平。
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动党不断关心农业的发展。农业问题是党中央全会多次的重要决议的中心。党的第三次代表大会向我国农民提出了一项根本任务：到1960年要保证我国粮食自给自足，为了实现这一重大任务，我国劳动人民已经动员了一切力量。1959年是光荣执行党所提出的这项任务的决定性的一年。到现在为止所进行的工作和农业耕种的情况表明，胜利完成上述任务的一切可能性是存在的。
    阿尔巴尼亚为建设社会主义而斗争所取得的成就中，教育和文化的成就占据了一个重要的位置。如其他社会主义国家一样，在我国也完全证明了马克思主义的著名论点，即社会主义是使文化、科学、艺术成为广大群众财富的唯一社会制度，这种制度保证人民的才能和创造力量的蓬勃发展，能培养出具有人类崇高品质的新人。
    在党的领导下，我国在文化和思想上也正在胜利地进行社会主义革命。到1955年，我国已消灭了四十岁以下的文盲。从1946年起，破天荒地实行了全面的初小义务教育。现在，在很多城市和农村正在推行七年制的义务教育。普通学校和职业学校网大大地扩大了，夜校和函授学校也有了很大的增长。我国第一次由人民政权建立了国立大学、高等农学院、师范学院和科学研究机构。今天在阿尔巴尼亚，比之1938年，学校和学生数增加了三倍半，教师增加了五倍。在我们共和国的每六个公民中，就有一个人是在正规的学校中学习。如果拿我国最近几年来的材料比较，一千个居民中有一百六十六人是学生，而希腊只有一百五十三人，意大利一百二十六人，南斯拉夫一百二十七人，土耳其八十五人。同样在艺术、文化和文学领域内，也都获得了很大成就。过去连做梦也不会想到阿尔巴尼亚会有歌舞剧院、电影制片厂、话剧院、国家歌舞团、杂剧院和自己的艺术影片、歌剧作品等等。所有这一切都已在人民的阿尔巴尼亚、在劳动党英明领导下的阿尔巴尼亚的前进的社会主义道路上变成了现实。
    党的最高目标是不断改善劳动群众的生活。毫无疑问，上述各方面的成就在这一方面也带来了巨大的变化。
    我国人民在始终不渝的斗争中，突破了千难万苦获得了这些成就。党的正确路线、群众的忘我劳动、苏联和其他社会主义国家的无私援助是我国取得进步的主要因素。马克思列宁主义的不朽思想和无产阶级国际主义思想鼓舞了在社会主义建设道路上的阿尔巴尼亚人民。以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的钢铁般的团结和巨大的成就，给我国人民在战胜困难和敌人的斗争中增强了力量。在这方面，伟大的、兄弟般的中国人民所取得的巨大胜利和惊人成就，在我国工人和农民当中引起了热烈的反应。兄弟般的中华人民共和国在各方面的跃进，鼓舞着阿尔巴尼亚人民争取新的胜利。我们，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党代表团的成员在中国已经访问了几天，我们亲眼看到在光荣的中国共产党领导下的这个伟大国家是如何变化的。它的出色的人民是多么有才能，他们有纯洁的感情和一颗伟大的心。中国人民对我们这个小国人民是多么友好、敬爱和亲热啊。我们完全相信：这次访问不仅有助于更加巩固联结在伟大社会主义阵营内的我们两国的牢不可破的友谊，而且还有助于我们劳动党学习中国共产党的极其丰富的经验。在我们停留中国的几天里，我们更清楚地看到了马克思列宁主义伟大思想的力量，这种思想把我们联结成为永恒的朋友，我们看到社会主义阵营是多么坚如磐石，各社会主义国家之间所建立的关系是多么正确。
    社会主义的敌人及其南斯拉夫应声虫力图分裂我们各国，诽谤我们的理想，并且破坏我们社会主义国家的建设。南斯拉夫修正主义者是社会主义的死敌，他们过去和现在都在无孔不入地、不择手段地反对社会主义国家。南斯拉夫修正主义者反对阿尔巴尼亚为时已久，历来就想破坏这个国家，企图把我国变成殖民地式的“第七共和国”。他们像资本主义国家一样用政治破坏、最卑鄙的挑衅、间谍等活动反对我国。南斯拉夫修正主义者将来也仍然会同过去一样遭到可耻的失败。阿尔巴尼亚现在和将来都将像岩石一样矗立不动，会使包括南斯拉夫修正主义者在内的一切敌人碰得头破血流。正如我国人民所说的：阿尔巴尼亚不是一百五十万人口的小国，而是拥有九亿人口的伟大强国，阿尔巴尼亚是以苏联为首的伟大的社会主义阵营的一个不可分割的成员。我国有一句民间谚语说得很好：“狗跟在后面狂吠，商队仍继续前进。”我们说，让敌人做白日梦去吧，让南斯拉夫修正主义者画饼充饥去吧，社会主义是挡不住的，它正在胜利进军，将在全世界获得胜利。（附图片）
