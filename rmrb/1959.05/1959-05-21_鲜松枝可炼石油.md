    Fresh Pine Branches Can Be Refined into Petroleum

    What are pine branches good for?

    They can be refined into synthetic petroleum.

    This is a successful research achievement by the Peat Comprehensive Utilization Group of the Lanzhou Branch of the Petroleum Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, in collaboration with the Gansu Provincial Petroleum and Chemical Industry Bureau, assisting the Wuzhu Oil Refinery in Longxi. They used an internal combustion dry distillation furnace, with fresh pine branches as raw material.

    This method of producing synthetic petroleum has many advantages: simple production; high oil yield, with ten jin of pine tar obtainable from every hundred jin of fresh pine branches; and raw materials are available throughout the country. With the development of our country's greening efforts, the amount of fresh pine branches will further increase in the future, providing a more abundant source of raw materials for oil refining. Therefore, the success of this research has opened up a new path for synthetic petroleum in our country.

    鲜松枝可炼石油
    松树枝有什么用？
    可以炼制人造石油。
    这是中国科学院石油研究所兰州分所泥煤综合利用组，最近和甘肃省石油化工局共同协助陇西五竹炼油厂研究成功的。他们采用内燃式干馏炉，以新鲜的松树枝作为原料。
    这一人造石油的方法有许多优点：生产简便；收油率高，每百斤鲜松枝可以得松焦油十斤；原料遍及全国。随着我国绿化事业的发展，今后鲜松枝还将大量增多，为炼油提供更为充足的原料。所以，这一方法的研究成功，为我国人造石油又开辟了一条新的途径。
