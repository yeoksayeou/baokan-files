    Impromptu Poem at the Respect-the-Elderly Meeting
    Zhou Shoujuan
    It is the season when peonies are in full bloom with vibrant colors. On the afternoon of April 29th, golden sunlight shone upon the Second Conference Room of the CPPCC Auditorium. Premier Zhou Enlai specially invited 383 CPPCC members from all over the country to hold a unique tea party. To show respect for the elderly, the invited members were all over sixty years old. Everyone was joyful and full of energy. I also felt suddenly younger. Such a grand gathering should not be without poetry, so I casually composed two quatrains to elicit a smile from the elders!
    A hall full of white hair, gathering all the wise,
    The spring light has not aged, a hundred flowers bloom brightly;
    Cheering and wishing people long life together,
    And wishing our country ten thousand years.
    My heart is still fiery, my body is still strong,
    The brave general Huang Zhong is my teacher;
    Amidst the surging sounds of the Great Leap Forward, I completely forget my age,
    There is no need to recite poems about the setting sun anymore.
    (Referring to the poem "The setting sun is infinitely good, but it is only near dusk")

    敬老会席上口占
    周瘦鹃
    正是姹紫嫣红牡丹怒放的季节，四月二十九日下午，黄澄澄的阳光，普照着政协礼堂的第二会议室；周恩来总理特邀来自祖国各地的三百八十三位全国政协委员，举行一个别开生面的茶话会，为了表示敬老之意，所以邀请的委员们，年龄都是在六十以上的。大家欢天喜地活力满身。我也觉得突然年青了。如此盛会，不可无诗，因口占二绝句，以博诸老一粲！
    白发满堂集众贤，
    春光未老百花妍；
    欢呼共祝人长寿，
    更祝宗邦万万年。
    心犹炽热身犹健，
    骁将黄忠是我师；
    跃进声中浑忘老，
    不须更诵夕阳诗。
    （指“夕阳无限好，只是近黄昏”一诗）
