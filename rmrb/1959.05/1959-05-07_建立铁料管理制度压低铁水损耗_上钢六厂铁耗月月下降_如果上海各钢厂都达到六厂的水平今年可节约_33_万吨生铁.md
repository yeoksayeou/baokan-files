　　Establishing an Iron Material Management System to Reduce Molten Iron Loss
    Shanghai No. 6 Steel Plant's Iron Consumption Decreases Month by Month
    If Shanghai Steel Plants All Reach the Level of No. 6 Plant, 330,000 Tons of Pig Iron Can Be Saved This Year

    (Our newspaper, Shanghai, 6th dispatch) Shanghai No. 6 Steel Plant, while carrying out the high-yield, high-quality red flag competition, also mobilized the masses to try every possible means to save pig iron, striving to produce more steel with the same amount of iron. In recent months, the amount of pig iron consumed has decreased month by month.

    In January, Shanghai No. 6 Steel Plant used an average of 1,319 kilograms of iron to refine one ton of steel. In February, it was reduced to 1,298 kilograms. In March, it was further reduced to 1,263 kilograms. In early and mid-April, on average, only 1,251 kilograms of iron were used to refine one ton of steel. This level of iron consumption has reached the consumption quota required by the National Converter Steelmaking Conference to be achieved in the third quarter, and is approaching the higher target required by the conference for the fourth quarter.

    If calculated at the current level, excluding further reductions in the future, this plant can save more than 4,500 tons of pig iron in the next three quarters. Adding the pig iron already saved in the first quarter, 4,100 tons of steel can be produced this year.

    At the beginning of this year, the Party organization of this plant, while mobilizing the masses to increase steel production and quality, paid attention to educating the workers on saving pig iron. In discussions, the workers also criticized the past thinking that "one should not be particular about saving when using native iron to make steel." The workers said: Ironmaking workers work hard to refine iron, and transport workers transport iron from thousands of miles away. We must try every possible means to pay attention to saving and turn every ounce of iron into steel. Among the projects in the red flag competition carried out by all the workers in the factory, the first and second items were output and quality, and the third item was iron consumption.

    It is indeed difficult to reduce iron consumption per ton of steel when the amount of native iron used is large. In order to overcome this difficulty, Shanghai No. 6 Steel Plant has taken many measures in management and operation. In the past, there was no weighing system for materials used in the workshop. A large account was calculated once a month, and no one investigated the reasons for using more or less. This year, they changed this method of "eating from the same pot" and established a set of iron material management system. From the time pig iron enters the factory, it is weighed at every stage. The cupola and converter also adopt a fixed iron supply method for fixed-point measurement, so that each shift and each furnace knows the material usage. The three shifts of workers also calculate the material usage and finished products separately, and publish the iron consumption accounting results every day to help workers analyze the material usage, find out the reasons, and improve operations. For example, converter workers found that in the past, when slagging, some new workers, due to lack of experience, pressed the slagging rod too deep, resulting in a layer of molten steel on the floating surface being skimmed out. The old workers helped them master the slagging technology, placing the slagging rod between the slag and the steel, and the loss of molten steel was greatly reduced. In the past, steel pouring workers often did not grasp the amount of remaining molten steel well. After the steel ingots were poured, sometimes there was still a lot of remaining steel in the molten steel ladle, which could not be poured again, so they were discarded as large pieces of scrap steel. Because these steels are very large, it is difficult to re-smelt them, often causing waste. Now they have improved the design of the molten steel ladle, and can accurately control the remaining steel when pouring steel, and the molten steel is fully utilized. Cupola workers saw that if the sulfur content of molten iron was high, the converter would have to increase the number of slagging times, but each additional slagging would turn a lot of molten iron into iron oxide and be blown away in large quantities. They adopted two methods of sulfur removal, inside and outside the furnace, to help converter workers reduce the number of slagging times and save molten iron. The cupola itself also tries to reduce the loss of molten iron as much as possible. Therefore, the molten iron loss of this plant's cupola is only 2% to 3%, which is more than half lower than that of general factories.

    In Shanghai No. 6 Steel Plant, saving pig iron has now become a habit for workers, and they regard pig iron as a treasure. When the converter is blowing, a large number of scattered steel blocks splash out, and the workers pick them up and put them into the furnace. A few days ago, some workers were drawn from the workshop to go to the waste slag yard to knock down the scrap steel mixed in the steel slag piece by piece and take it back to the workshop for re-smelting. Since April, although the sulfur content of pig iron has been higher than in March, the iron consumption per ton of steel has been reduced by twelve kilograms compared with March.

    At present, the experience of this plant in saving pig iron has attracted the attention of relevant departments and other steel plants. According to statistics from the Shanghai Metallurgical Industry Bureau, if the iron consumption of all steel plants in Shanghai can reach the current level of Shanghai No. 6 Steel Plant, Shanghai can save 330,000 tons of pig iron for the country this year when completing the national plan.

### 建立铁料管理制度压低铁水损耗  上钢六厂铁耗月月下降  如果上海各钢厂都达到六厂的水平今年可节约33万吨生铁

　　建立铁料管理制度压低铁水损耗
    上钢六厂铁耗月月下降
    如果上海各钢厂都达到六厂的水平今年可节约33万吨生铁
    本报上海6日电　上海第六钢铁厂在开展高产优质红旗竞赛中，同时发动群众千方百计节约生铁，力争用同样数量的铁炼出更多数量的钢，这几个月来，生铁耗用量月月下降。
    上钢六厂1月份炼一吨钢平均用铁一千三百一十九公斤，2月份降低到一千二百九十八公斤，3月份又降为一千二百六十三公斤，4月上旬和中旬，炼一吨钢平均只用到一千二百五十一公斤。这个铁耗水平，已经达到了全国转炉炼钢会议要求在第三季度达到的消耗定额，并且接近会议要求第四季度所要达到的更高的指标。
    如果按目前这个水平计算，以后进一步降低的差额不计在内，这个厂今后三个季度内就可以节约四千五百多吨生铁，加上第一季度已经节约下来的生铁，今年可增产四千一百吨钢。
    今年年初，这个厂的党组织在发动群众提高钢产量和质量的同时，就注意对职工进行了节约生铁的教育。职工们在讨论中，也批判了过去那种“用土铁炼钢不能讲究节约”的思想，工人们说：炼铁工人千辛万苦地把铁炼出来，运输工人千里迢迢地把铁运来，我们一定要千方百计地注意节约，把一斤一两的铁都炼成钢才对。全厂工人在开展红旗竞赛的项目中，第一、第二两项是产量质量，第三项就是铁耗。
    在土铁用量较大的情况下，要求每吨钢降低铁耗，这确实有不少困难。上钢六厂为了克服这个困难，在管理上和操作上曾采取了许多措施。车间里过去用料没有过磅制度，一个月算一笔大账，用多用少也没有人追查原因。今年，他们改变了这种“吃大锅饭”的方法，建立了一套铁料管理制度。生铁从进厂开始，道道过磅。化铁炉和转炉还采用铁水固定供应办法，进行定点测定，让每一个班每一个炉子都知道用料情况。三班工人也把用料和成品分开来计算，并且每天公布铁耗核算结果，帮助工人分析用料情况，找出原因，改进操作。例如转炉工人发现过去扒渣时，有些新工人因为经验不足，把扒杆压得太深，结果把浮面一层钢水也扒了出来，老工人就帮助他们掌握扒渣技术，把扒杆放在渣和钢之间，钢水的损耗就大大减少。浇钢工人过去常常因为没有掌握好钢水的余量，钢锭浇好后，有时钢水包里还有许多余钢，不能再浇，就一大块一大块的当作废钢丢在一边。这些钢，因为体积很大，很难回炉重炼，往往造成浪费。现在他们改进了钢水包的设计，浇钢时可以准确地控制余钢，钢水得到了充分的利用。化铁炉工人看见铁水含硫一高，转炉势必要增加造渣次数，但多造一次渣，就有许多铁水变成氧化铁，大量地被吹走。他们就采用炉内炉外两道去硫的办法，帮助转炉工人减少造渣次数，节约铁水。化铁炉本身也尽量减少铁水损耗，因此，这个厂化铁炉的铁水损耗只有2％到3％，比一般工厂低一半以上。
    在上钢六厂，现在工人们对节约生铁已经成为一种习惯，他们把生铁看成是宝贝。转炉在吹炼时，有大量零星钢块飞溅出来，工人们就把它们拾起来投入炉内。前几天，车间里抽出了一部分工人，到废渣场把混在钢渣内的废钢，一块一块的敲下来，拿回车间回炉重炼。4月份以来，虽然生铁含硫比3月份高，但每吨钢的铁耗反比3月份降低了十二公斤。
    目前，这个厂节约生铁的经验，已经引起有关部门和其他钢厂的重视。据上海市冶金工业局的统计，如果上海各钢厂的铁耗都能达到上钢六厂目前的水平，今年上海在完成国家计划时，就可以为国家节约三十三万吨生铁。
