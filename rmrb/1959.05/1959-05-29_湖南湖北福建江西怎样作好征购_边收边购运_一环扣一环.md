Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, 28th: The rape crop in Hunan Province has been completely harvested, and wheat has also entered the tense stage of full-scale harvesting. The grain and oil purchased in Xiangtan, Shaoyang, Changde and other regions that harvested earlier have already begun to be put into storage. According to incomplete statistics, as of May 20th, the province's storage volume of rapeseed, rapeseed oil, and wheat has increased by about 40% compared with the same period last year.

This year, Hunan's rape and wheat generally achieved bumper harvests. Many communes enthusiastically sell grain and oil after the harvest to support the people in cities and industrial and mining areas. The Gaosha People's Commune in Dongkou County planned to sell 65,000 jin of rapeseed oil to the state. Within three days after the harvest, the entire commune sold more than 55,000 jin and sent it all to state warehouses. During the rape harvest, the Chengtan and Dayao communes in Liuyang County properly arranged labor, implemented quick harvesting, quick drying, quick pressing, and quick sales to the state, and quickly overfulfilled the state's unified purchase task for rapeseed oil.

In order to do a good job in the unified purchase of summer grain and oil, the Hunan Provincial People's Committee issued instructions in April, requiring all regions to make preparations for unified purchase and storage as early as possible. Before the harvest of summer ripe grain and oil crops, all regions conducted detailed surveys of production and commune consumption, rationally allocated unified purchase tasks, appropriately increased purchasing points, and entrusted oil mills and supply and marketing departments to purchase on their behalf to facilitate commune sales.

Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 28th: The broad masses of peasants in Hubei Province are actively selling rapeseed to the state. By the 25th, the grain departments in various regions had purchased and stored a total of 10 million jin of rapeseed.

The Huanggang region, which has an earlier harvest season, has recently been storing more than 600,000 jin of rapeseed every day. Farmers in Hanchuan County sold 700,000 jin of rapeseed to the state in three days. On the 24th, members of the Yangji Management District of the Huancheng Commune in this county beat gongs and drums and sold more than 70,000 jin of rapeseed to the state in one day. The rapeseed sold to the state by the Xin Shenghuo People's Commune in Qichun County in five days was equal to half of the state's planned purchase.

Hubei Province has achieved a bumper harvest of rapeseed this year. The results of trial pressing in various places show that the oil yield is mostly higher than in previous years. In order to ensure that rapeseed is collected quickly, transported quickly, and processed quickly, and to successfully complete the purchase task, the grain departments generally increased and adjusted purchasing points before the start of purchasing based on the characteristics of this year's contiguous oil crops, as well as transportation, labor, and processing capacity. In purchasing, the policies of retaining sufficient seeds and paying higher prices for better quality were implemented. Most purchasing points in the region also managed oil mills, combining purchasing, transportation, and processing into one rope, which saved labor and accelerated the purchasing and oil extraction of rapeseed. For areas with insufficient processing capacity, the grain department organized mobile purchasing teams to purchase and transport to other places for processing.

Xinhua News Agency, Fuzhou, 28th: Many people's communes in Fujian Province have sold their surplus grain to the state after achieving a bumper harvest of barley and wheat. As of May 20th, the province had purchased and stored 14.72 million jin of barley and wheat. The Yangcheng Brigade of the Huangshi People's Commune in Putian County sold 17,654 jin in one day, overfulfilling the state's unified purchase task, and the quality of the grain met the prescribed standards.

Party committees at all levels in Fujian Province have strengthened their leadership over the unified purchase work. Many people's communes have properly arranged labor. After barley and wheat are ripe, they harvest, dry, winnow, and deliver to storage at the same time. In order to facilitate the masses in selling their surplus grain, the grain departments have set up many purchasing stations in the main barley and wheat producing areas, so that grain is purchased as soon as it arrives.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 28th: In Jiangxi Province, 1.6 million mu of the province’s 2 million mu of barley and wheat have been harvested, and all 3 million mu of rapeseed have been harvested. Currently, 230,000 jin of new grain and 5.5 million jin of rapeseed have been purchased and stored, and 1.5 million jin of rapeseed oil has been extracted.

During the wheat and rapeseed harvest, Party organizations at all levels from the province to the commune were led by the first secretary or secretary to form a grain and oil purchase and transfer command organization with the participation of grain, transportation and other departments to strengthen leadership. They also adopted the method of simultaneous harvesting, purchasing, oil extraction, and transportation. Cadres from grain, finance and trade, transportation, and banking departments went to the main production areas to help communes harvest, thresh, dry, and winnow, while carrying out purchasing and transportation work, which greatly facilitated the communes in delivering grain. In Yudu, Gao'an, and Jinxian counties, wheat and rapeseed were harvested in just a few days, and the delivery and storage tasks were completed according to plan. Currently, the wheat and rapeseed producing areas have prepared more than 30,000 pieces of transportation equipment such as bamboo rafts, wooden sailboats, handcarts, and automobiles, and more than 30,000 laborers are engaged in short-distance transportation every day.

    湖南湖北福建江西怎样作好征购
    边收边购运　一环扣一环
    新华社长沙28日电　湖南省的油菜已全部收割，小麦也进入了全面收割的紧张阶段，收割较早的湘潭、邵阳、常德等专区收购的粮油，已经开始入库。据不完全统计，截至5月20日止，全省的菜籽、菜油、小麦入库量，比去年同期增加40％左右。
    今年，湖南的油菜、小麦一般都获得丰收。许多公社在收获后就踊跃出售粮油，支援城市和工矿区人民。洞口县高沙人民公社按照计划，要向国家出售菜油六万五千斤；在收获以后三天内，全社出售了五万五千多斤，并且全部送入国家仓库。浏阳县的澄潭、大瑶两个公社，在油菜收获期间，妥善安排劳力，实行快收、快晒、快榨、快向国家出售，很快就超额完成了国家菜油统购任务。
    为了做好夏季粮油统购工作，湖南省人民委员会在4月份就发出指示，要求各地早些做好统购、入库的各项准备工作。各地在夏熟粮油作物收获以前，都详细地调查了产量和公社消费量的情况，合理分配了统购任务；适当增设了收购点，同时委托榨坊和供销部门代购，以便利公社出售。
    新华社武汉28日电　湖北省广大农民积极地把油菜籽卖给国家。到25日，各地粮食部门征购入库的菜籽共达一千万斤。
    收获季节较早的黄冈专区，最近每天入库菜籽六十多万斤。汉川县农民在三天内就向国家出售了菜籽七十万斤。这个县的环城公社杨集管理区的社员，在24日一天内，敲锣打鼓，将七万多斤菜籽卖给国家。蕲春县新生活人民公社在五天内向国家出售的菜籽，就等于国家计划征购的半数。
    湖北省今年的油菜籽获得普遍丰收。各地试榨的结果，出油率大都比往年提高。粮食部门为了做到菜籽收得快、运的快、加工快，出色地完成征购任务，在开始征购之前，普遍根据今年油料作物连片的特点，以及交通、劳力和加工能力等条件，增设和调整了收购点。在收购中，贯彻了留足种籽、优质优价等政策；大部分地区的收购点都兼管榨坊，将收购、运输和加工拧成一股绳，既节省劳力，又加快了油菜籽的收购和出油工作，对于加工能力不足的地区，粮食部门就组织流动收购组，到产区边收购，边运往外地加工。
    新华社福州28日电　福建省许多人民公社在大麦、小麦获得丰收以后，纷纷把余粮卖给国家。截至5月20日止，全省收购入库的大麦小麦达一千四百七十二万斤。莆田县黄石人民公社洋埕大队一天就出售了一万七千六百五十四斤，超额完成国家的统购任务，粮食的质量都符合规定标准。
    福建省各地党委加强了对统购工作的领导。许多人民公社妥善安排了劳动力，在大麦小麦成熟以后，就边收、边晒、边扬净、边交售入库。为了便利群众出卖余粮，粮食部门在大、小麦主要产区设立了许多收购站，作到粮食随到随收购。
    新华社南昌28日电　江西省二百多万亩大麦小麦已有一百六十万亩收获完毕，三百多万亩油菜全部收获。目前已有二十三万斤新粮和五百五十万斤油菜籽征购入库，并且榨出菜油一百五十万斤。
    在麦子、油菜收获期间，从省到公社各级党组织，都由第一书记或书记挂帅，组成有粮食、交通等部门参加的粮油征购调运指挥机构，加强领导；并且采取边收、边购、边榨油、边运输的方法，由粮食、财贸、运输、银行等部门的干部到主要产区，一面帮助公社收割打场，晒干扬净，一面进行征购、运输工作，给公社交售粮食以很大的方便。于都、高安、进贤三个县的小麦和油菜，只用几天时间就收获完毕，按计划完成交售入库任务。现在，各麦子、油菜产区预备了竹筏、木帆船、手推车、汽车等交通工具三万余件，每天有三万多劳动力在短途运输。
