    Guangxi Produces Tugboat
    The Wuzhou Shipyard in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region has successfully manufactured its first double-steam engine tugboat. This tugboat is 26 meters long, 5 meters wide, and has an average draft of 1.35 meters. Because it has two main engines, it sails smoothly; if one main engine fails, it can continue to sail. During its sea trials, the tugboat proved to be perfectly suitable for navigating shallow, rapid inland rivers. (Yulin)

    广西制出拖轮
    广西僮族自治区梧州造船厂自制成功第一艘双蒸汽机拖轮。这艘拖轮全长二十六公尺、宽五公尺，平均吃水一点三五公尺。由于它有两部主机，航行平稳；如有一部主机发生故障，仍能继续航行。这艘拖轮在试航中证明，它完全适合于浅水急流的内河航行。　（雨淋）
