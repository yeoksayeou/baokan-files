Second Spring
Speech by Committee Member Luo Ying

　　Chairman, fellow committee members:

　　I am honored to be invited to participate in the CPPCC this time and to be able to see our most beloved and great leader Chairman Mao at Huairentang. I feel this is the greatest honor of my life, and I am very excited, grateful, and fortunate! I wholeheartedly support the reports of Premier Zhou and the two Vice Premiers Li.

　　I am a scientific and technical worker who participated in engineering technical work for decades before liberation, including railways, highways, bridges, factories, and so on. Although I accumulated some experience, I never cared about politics or the service object, only knowing how to work diligently and "do my duty," thinking that was serving the country and worthy of my conscience. With such an effort without a position or direction, in most of my life, I could not talk about any contribution to the motherland or the people. I am extremely fortunate that at the age of sixty, I was able to welcome liberation and witness our poor and blank motherland suddenly leap to become a great socialist country in the world in just ten years, achieving unprecedented brilliant achievements in politics, economy, culture, science, and so on, making me feel the happiness and pride of being a Chinese for the first time, and from then on, I had a new life, a second spring! Chairman Mao said that we are doing extremely glorious and great undertakings that our predecessors have never done before. How excited, invigorated, and inspired should I be to contribute my extremely small strength to this extremely glorious and great undertaking!

　　After liberation, I joined the government work. Since 1951, I have served as a consulting engineer for the Ministry of Heavy Industry (now the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry) until now. However, since 1953, I suddenly contracted a serious tumor disease and underwent several surgeries. After several years, I am still recuperating in Shanghai and have not been able to participate in actual work. However, thanks to the government's care, I was not treated as sick leave and dismissed, so I have no worries about my life. I often feel uneasy about receiving undeserved salary. This shows how meticulously our most beloved Party cares for intellectuals. I feel extremely warm, and I would like to express my most loyal gratitude to the Party here!

　　During my recuperation, I was appointed as a member of the Technical Advisory Committee of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge, thanks to the government's support, and was able to participate in a small but significant part of the bridge's work. What made me most happy was that I was able to have contact with Soviet bridge experts and learn a lot of advanced Soviet experience. I studied and worked on bridge engineering in the United States, and later built many bridges on railways and highways in our country, but I had never used such pipe column foundations as those used in the Wuhan Bridge. This creation has a significant impact on future bridge and structural engineering, and it was successful through close cooperation between Chinese and Soviet engineers. From this incident, I was reminded of the unparalleled power of the great Sino-Soviet alliance and its huge contribution to world peace and human happiness!

　　The construction of the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge demonstrates the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system. I once participated in the project of the Qiantang River Bridge in Hangzhou. At that time, I thought I could give full play to my strengths and get the opportunity to "use my talents." Unexpectedly, I encountered unimaginable obstacles in all aspects of design and construction. The people of Hangzhou had earnest hopes for this bridge, only based on the folk legend that "the Qiantang River has no bottom" and that there were turbulent Qiantang tides. In the past, when the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway was built, British engineers were helpless. The reactionary rule of the Kuomintang believed that such a bridge could not be built by Chinese engineers. At first, the American Waddell Bridge Consulting Engineer was invited to make a design, but it required 12 million silver dollars at that time, which was difficult to raise, so it was shelved. Later, we Chinese engineers had to redesign a double-layer bridge, and the budget was reduced to 5 million yuan. Finally, the actual cost after completion was 5.3 million yuan. During the construction, we originally advocated self-managing the necessary mechanical equipment and recruiting workers to build it ourselves, but at that time, the authorities thought that such an investment was too large, and there were no other large bridge projects available, and the steel used for the bridge had to be purchased from abroad. Therefore, the suggestions of our engineering staff were not adopted, and foreign contractors were able to take the opportunity to contract the upper steel trusses and the mid-river pier projects because they had steel and machinery equipment. Due to the quicksand at the bottom of the Qiantang River and the tight construction schedule, we encountered various difficulties from foreign contractors and various obstacles from the relevant departments of the reactionary government during the construction process. Therefore, more of our energy was spent on personnel disputes than on actual construction. In Wuhan, I saw the correct leadership of the Party and the government on the Yangtze River Bridge and the support and cooperation from all parties, and I felt that the engineers of New China were really lucky. The Wuhan Bridge is much larger than the Qiantang River Bridge, and all the steel beams are manufactured with our own steel, but the completion period was two years ahead of schedule, fully reflecting the wisdom and strength of the working masses. This is something that the Qiantang River project could never compare with.

　　During the construction of the Qiantang River Bridge in Hangzhou, there was also such an incident. During the construction of the main bridge piers, shifts were arranged every day to transport personnel to the bridge piers by steamship. Once, the steamship capsized in the wind and waves, drowning more than 80 people, creating a rare and tragic record in the history of bridge construction. However, at that time, the reactionary government succumbed to foreign contractors and ignored it as a natural disaster, which aroused our great indignation. The Wuhan Bridge had almost no work-related accidents due to thorough safety measures, showing the new relationship between people in the new society. Just from the comparison of these two bridges, by analogy, it is very clear to see the bright scene of the whole of China today!

　　I deeply understand that the great achievements of our country in the ten years after liberation are the result of the arduous labor of the people of the whole country under the leadership of the Party. The most important reason is the improvement of political consciousness, so that we can resolutely take the socialist road, which is the road that all mankind should take. Although I am in my twilight years, I am not willing to lag behind. I must continue to strengthen self-transformation, strive to study Marxism-Leninism and Chairman Mao's works, participate in social practice as much as possible, learn from workers and peasants, stand firm, reach the six political criteria, to express my support for the Party, and in the annual national economic plan, do my part to fulfill my lifelong ambition to serve the country!

　　Let us cheer for the greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in 1959 and strive for it!

### 第二次青春  罗英委员的发言

专栏：

　　第二次青春
    罗英委员的发言主席、各位委员：
    这次我被邀参加政协，能在怀仁堂见到我们最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席，感到这是我有生以来最大的光荣，非常兴奋，感激并庆幸！我对周总理和两位李副总理的报告，表示衷心拥护。
    我是一个科学技术工作者，在解放前参加过工程技术工作数十年，包括铁路、公路、桥梁、房厂等等，虽然积累了一些经验，但从来不问政治，不管服务对象，只知辛勤劳作，“尽忠职守”，以为就是报国，就无愧于良知。在这样无立场、无方向的努力下，在我的大半生中，就谈不到对祖国、对人民有什么贡献了。我万分欣幸的是，在六十岁的时候，还能迎接解放，亲眼看到我们一穷二白的祖国，在短短十年中，竟然一跃而成为世界上一个伟大的社会主义国家，在政治、经济、文化、科学等等各方面都取得了史无前例的辉煌成就，使我第一次感到作个中国人民的幸福和自豪，从此有了新生命，有了第二次的青春！毛主席说过，我们正在做我们的前人从未做过的极其光荣伟大的事业。我能在这极其光荣伟大的事业中，尽我一分极其渺小的力量，我该感到如何激动振兴，欢欣鼓舞啊！
    解放后我就参加了政府工作。自一九五一年起，担任重工业部（现冶金工业部）的顾问工程师，直到如今。但自一九五三年起，我忽得了严重的瘤病，动了多次手术，经过数年之久，迄今我尚在上海疗养，未能参加实际工作。但蒙政府照顾，并未当作病假离职，使我生活无忧，我时常感到无功受禄寝馈难安。由此足见我们最爱戴的党是如何无微不至地关怀知识分子，我真感到无比温暖，我在此谨向党表示最忠心的感谢！
    在我疗病期间，蒙政府不弃，聘为武汉长江大桥技术顾问委员会委员，因得参加了大桥一点微不足道的工作。最使我高兴的是因此得和苏联桥梁专家们有了接触，学习到不少苏联先进经验。我曾在美国研究过和做过桥梁工程，后来在我国铁路、公路上又修建过不少桥梁，但像武汉大桥所用的这样管柱基础，就从未用过。这个创造对今后桥梁和结构工程有重大的作用，它是通过中苏工程师密切合作而成功的。从这件事使我联想到，中苏伟大同盟的无比威力，以及它对世界和平及人类幸福所作出的巨大贡献！
    武汉长江大桥的修建，显示了社会主义制度的无比优越性。我曾经参加过杭州的钱塘江大桥的工程。那时我以为可以发挥所长，得到“用武之地”的机会了。不料在设计、施工各方面都遇到不可想像的阻挠。杭州人民对于这座大桥是有殷切希望的，只以民间传说“钱塘江无底”，而且有汹涌的钱塘潮，过去修建沪杭甬铁路时，英国工程师为之束手，国民党的反动统治就认为这种大桥不是中国工程师所能办的。其初请了美国的华德尔桥梁顾问工程师作出设计，但需要那时银圆一千二百万元，款巨难筹，只好搁置。后来不得已才让我们中国工程师重行设计双层桥梁，预算减到五百万元，最后完工核算，实费五百三十万元。在施工时，我们本来主张自办必要的机械设备，自己招工兴建，但那时当局以为这样投资过大，又无其他大桥工程可用，而且桥梁用的钢材又需购自国外，因此我们工程人员的主张未被采用，而外国包商以有钢材和机具设备，就得以乘机承包了上部钢桁和江中正桥桥墩工程。由于钱塘江底有流沙，而且工期紧迫，在施工过程中，遇到外国包商的种种刁难，及反动政府有关各部的各种掣肘，因而全部精力用于人事纠纷者多于真正施工方面。我在武汉看到党和政府对长江大桥的正确领导，以及各方面的支援协作，感到新中国的工程师们真是幸运。武汉大桥比钱塘江桥大得多，而且所有全部钢梁都是我国自己的钢材制造的，但完工期限却比计划提前了两年，充分反映了工人群众的智慧和力量，这就是钱塘江工程所万万不能比拟的了。
    在杭州钱塘江大桥施工时，还有过这样一件事。在正桥桥墩施工，每日工作调班，俱是用汽船运送人员，前往桥墩工作。有一次汽船在风浪中颠复了。淹死八十余人，造成桥梁史上罕见的惨痛纪录，然而那时反动政府屈从外国包商，认为天然灾害就置之不理，引起我们极大愤慨。武汉大桥因安全施设周到，工伤事故差不多是没有的，表现出新社会中人与人的新的关系。仅仅从这两座桥的对比，以此类推，很显明看出，今天全中国的一片光明景象！
    我深切了解，解放后十年来我国的伟大成就，是在党的领导下，全国人民作了如何艰辛劳动，才能获得的结果。其中最主要原因是政治觉悟的提高，因而才能坚决地走社会主义道路，也就是全人类所应当走的道路。我虽在垂暮之年也不甘落伍。我一定继续加强自我改造，努力学习马克思列宁主义和毛主席著作，尽量参加社会实践，向工农学习，站稳立场，达到六条政治标准，来表示我对党的拥护，在每年国民经济计划中，尽我一分应尽的力量，完成我毕生矢志报国的志愿！
    让我们为一九五九年更大更好更全面的跃进而奋斗而欢呼！
