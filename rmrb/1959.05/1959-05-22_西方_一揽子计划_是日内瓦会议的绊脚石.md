    The West's "Package Deal" is a Stumbling Block to the Geneva Conference
    Commentator of this newspaper
    World opinion is closely watching the Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference. Originally, the primary task of this conference should have been to discuss and resolve the major issues that are most pressing in the current international situation and have the most favorable conditions for early resolution, namely the issue of concluding a peace treaty with Germany and the issue of ending the occupation regime in West Berlin. However, in recent days, the Western foreign ministers have deliberately shifted the focus of the conference and obstructed progress in the discussion of substantive issues.
    At the meeting on May 14, U.S. Secretary of State Herter, representing the three Western powers, proposed a so-called "peace plan." This is another name for the so-called "package deal" that Western newspapers had been widely publicizing before the conference. This plan entangles the Berlin issue, the issue of concluding a peace treaty with Germany, the issue of German reunification, the issue of European security, and the issue of general disarmament, stipulating that they are an "indivisible whole." The complexity of its levels, the intricacy of its clauses, and the interweaving and entanglement of various issues artificially lump together issues that could have been resolved earlier with difficult issues. According to the Western plan, the resolution of each issue must depend on the simultaneous resolution of other issues, thereby precluding the possibility of partial and individual solutions. It is particularly evident that they regard the issue of German reunification as a prerequisite for resolving all other issues, and the steps for achieving German reunification are still the old method of so-called "free elections" that Western countries once used to undermine the 1955 Four Foreign Ministers' Conference. In the final analysis, this plan is still an attempt to annex the German Democratic Republic and drag the whole of Germany into the North Atlantic aggressive bloc. What is different from the past is that it even attempts to extend the so-called "occupation rights" that the West currently has in West Berlin to East Berlin. However, the Western countries actually describe this unrealistic and arrogant plan of theirs as some kind of "concession" and "accommodation" to the Soviet Union, which is complete self-deception! This plan, on the surface, seems to want to solve all the problems, but in reality, it does not want to solve any of the problems, in order to maintain the tense situation. As Comrade Khrushchev said, the Western plan is nothing more than a "Cold War" plan, a plan to implement the policy of "strength."
    The entire Western plan is premised on the issue of German reunification. But it is precisely on this issue that the Western plan is completely untenable. This is because: First, the East-West Foreign Ministers' Conference has no right to discuss and deal with the issue of German reunification; German reunification is an internal matter of Germany, a matter for the German people themselves. Second, German reunification cannot be a prerequisite for resolving other issues, especially the issue of a peace treaty with Germany; on the contrary, only by concluding a peace treaty with Germany can conditions be created and a path opened for German reunification. The reason why the Western plan has no foothold is that it completely ignores the current reality of Germany. This reality is the coexistence of two Germanys with different social systems. They both exercise sovereignty in their respective territories and are recognized by many countries internationally. This is a result of historical development after the war and cannot be denied by anyone. Although Western countries have long refused to recognize the German Democratic Republic, this time they have to participate in the conference together with the official representatives of the German Democratic Republic. Therefore, the Western countries' claim that the issue of German reunification must be handled by the four powers and that the German people should be left aside is not only a blatant interference in Germany's internal affairs but has also been negated by reality. No one can deny that the choice of what kind of social system and way of life must be decided by the people themselves, and any one-sided method or mechanical merger that attempts to impose one party's will on the other is unworkable. The Western countries' boasting about reunification while intensifying the rearmament of West Germany is nothing more than an attempt to annex the German Democratic Republic by relying on West Germany's military strength and population majority. It is obvious that the biggest obstacle to German reunification at present is none other than West Germany's rearmament. To remove this obstacle, a peace treaty with Germany must be concluded first. Only by concluding a peace treaty with Germany that can guarantee the peaceful and democratic development of the entire Germany can a premise be created for the two Germanys to gradually seek reunification through consultation and a foundation be laid for strengthening the peace and security of the entire Europe.
    In fact, the issue of German reunification is just a deceptive guise of the Western plan. To put it bluntly, neither West Germany nor the United States is willing to see Germany truly achieve reunification in a democratic and peaceful way. They are trying to accelerate the dangerous plan of rearming West Germany under the condition of German division. According to Associated Press reporter Hightower, senior U.S. officials even "knew long before the future Geneva conference that German reunification is impossible in the foreseeable future." If so, why do the Western countries insist on German reunification as a prerequisite for resolving all other issues? Isn't this a conspiracy to obstruct the resolution of other issues that can be realized at present with issues that are "impossible to realize" at present?
    In order to defend this completely unrealistic plan of the Western countries, the Western foreign ministers have been trying their best in recent days to oppose the Soviet Union's proposal to discuss the peace treaty with Germany. They even fantastically insisted that there is no "international unit in the name of Germany" at all, and that neither the German Democratic Republic nor the Federal Republic of Germany can represent Germany. If a peace treaty with Germany is concluded now, it would be "recognizing the permanent division of Germany." This is a completely malicious distortion. It can be seen that the Soviet draft peace treaty with Germany is precisely to promote the reunification of Germany. The Western countries' defense can only show that they want to push the peace treaty with Germany into the distant future, thereby forever maintaining the divided situation of Germany.
    Due to the Western countries' unreasonable entanglement with the "package deal," the Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference has made little progress since the substantive discussions began. Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko and German Democratic Republic Foreign Minister Bolz have sternly refuted the Western plan at the meeting and insisted that the conference should focus on discussing the issue of the peace treaty with Germany and the issue of the status of West Berlin. However, in order to remove obstacles and enable the conference to continue to progress, the Soviet representative also expressed that it is possible to consider raising some individual clauses and propositions of certain parts of the Western plan for separate discussion and research. Such as the four countries' declaration on resolving all international disputes by peaceful means, not providing assistance to aggressors, certain disarmament issues, and the issue of establishing a zone for limiting armaments. At the meeting on May 20, Gromyko further pointed out that both sides should seek the possibility of approaching each other's attitudes, rather than focusing on differences. This fully demonstrates the Soviet Union's sincerity in seeking agreement. However, whether the conference can achieve real progress does not depend entirely on the Soviet Union. The people of the world are concerned about the Geneva Conference and expect the Western foreign ministers to remove the stumbling blocks they have set up so that the conference can achieve positive results.

### 西方“一揽子计划”是日内瓦会议的绊脚石

    西方“一揽子计划”是日内瓦会议的绊脚石
    本报评论员
    世界各国的舆论正密切注视着日内瓦外长会议。本来这次会议的首要任务应该是讨论和解决当前国际局势中最迫切也最有条件及早解决的重大问题，即缔结对德和约问题和结束西柏林占领制度问题。但是西方外长们这些天来却故意转移会议中心，阻挠实质问题讨论的进展。
    在5月14日会议上，美国国务卿赫脱代表西方三国提出了一个所谓“和平计划”。这也就是西方报刊早在会议之前盛传过的所谓“一揽子计划”的别名。这个计划把柏林问题、缔结对德和约问题、德国统一问题、欧洲安全问题和普遍裁军问题等等，全都缠在一起，并且规定它们是“不可分割的整体”。其层次的复杂，条款的繁琐，各个问题相互之间的交叉牵扯，人为地把本来可以先行解决的问题同繁难的问题搅在一起。按照西方的计划，每一个问题的解决都必须取决于其他问题的同时解决，从而也就排除了局部和个别解决问题的可能。特别明显的是，它们把德国统一问题作为解决其他一切问题的前提，而实现德国统一的步骤，则仍是西方国家曾经用来破坏1955年四国外长会议的所谓“自由选举”的老办法。归根结蒂，这个计划还是企图吞并德意志民主共和国，把整个德国拉入北大西洋侵略集团。和过去所不同的是，它甚至妄想把西方目前在西柏林的所谓“占领权利”也扩大到东柏林去。但是西方国家居然把它们这个不现实的、狂妄的计划，说成是什么对苏联的“让步”和“迁就”，这完全是自欺欺人之谈！这个计划表面上看来似乎想解决所有的问题，但实际上它是什么问题也不想解决，以便继续保持紧张局势。正如赫鲁晓夫同志所说的，西方的计划不是别的，而是“冷战”计划，是执行“实力地位”政策的计划。
    整个西方计划是以德国统一问题为前提的。但恰恰在这个问题上，西方计划是完全站不住脚的。这是因为：第一，东西方外长会议现在根本无权讨论和处理德国的统一问题；德国的统一是德国内部、德国人民自己的事情。第二，德国统一不能作为解决其他问题，特别是对德和约问题的前提；相反，只有缔结对德和约，才能为德国统一创造条件，打开道路。西方计划之所以没有立足点，是因为它根本无视于目前德国的现实情况。这个现实就是两个不同社会制度的德国同时并存。它们都在各自的领土上行使着主权，并且都得到国际上许多国家的承认。这是战后历史发展的一种结果，决不是任何人所能否认得了的。西方国家虽则长期以来拒绝承认德意志民主共和国，但是这次它们却不得不同德意志民主共和国的正式代表一起参加会议。因此，西方国家那种认为必须由四大国来包办德国统一问题而把德国人民撇在一旁的主张，不仅是明目张胆地干涉德国内政，而且也早已为现实所否定了。谁也不能否认，选择什么样的社会制度和生活方式必须由人民自己来作出决定，任何企图以一方意志强加于另一方的片面办法或机械合并的办法，都是行不通的。西方国家在西德变本加厉地重新武装西德的情形下侈谈统一，其目的无非是想凭借西德的军事实力和人口多数来吞并德意志民主共和国。很明显，目前德国统一的最大障碍不是别的，而是西德的重新武装。要扫除这个障碍就必须先缔结对德和约，只有缔结能够保证整个德国和平民主发展的对德和约，才能为东西德双方通过协商来逐步谋求统一创造前提，为加强整个欧洲的和平安全奠定基础。
    其实，德国统一问题也只是西方计划的一个骗人的幌子而已。戳穿了说，现在无论是西德也好，美国也好，都不愿意德国在民主和平的道路上真正实现重新统一。他们力图在德国分裂的状况下，加速完成重新武装西德的危险计划。据美联社记者海托华透露，美国高级官员甚至“在未来日内瓦以前早就知道，在可以预测到的将来，德国统一是不可能实现的”。既然如此，西方为什么又要坚持以德国统一为解决其他一切问题的前提呢？难道这不正是一种预谋，企图以目前“不可能实现”的问题来阻挠目前有可能实现的其他问题的解决吗？
    为了给西方国家这个完全不现实的计划辩护，西方外长们这几天来就竭力反对苏联所提出的讨论对德和约的建议。他们竟异想天开地硬说，现在根本没有一个“以德国为名的国际单位”，无论是德意志民主共和国或德意志联邦共和国都不能代表德国，如果现在缔结对德和约，就是“承认德国永久分裂”。这完全是恶意的歪曲。人们可以看出，苏联的对德和约草案正是为了促进德国的统一。西方国家的辩解只能说明，它们想把对德和约推向遥远的未来，从而永远保持德国分裂的局面。
    由于西方国家以“一揽子计划”来进行无理纠缠，日内瓦外长会议自从开始实质问题的讨论以来，迄今很少进展。苏联外长葛罗米柯和德意志民主共和国外长博尔茨已在会上对西方计划加以严正驳斥，并坚持会议应集中讨论对德和约问题和西柏林地位问题。但是为了排除障碍，使会议得以继续进展，苏联代表也表示可以考虑把西方计划某些部分的个别条款和主张提出来加以单独讨论和研究。如四大国关于用和平方法解决一切国际争端、不给侵略者以援助的宣言、某些裁军问题和建立限制军备区的问题等。在5月20日会议上，葛罗米柯又进一步指出，双方应该谋求态度接近的可能性，而不是把注意力集中在分歧上。这充分表现了苏联谋求协议的诚意。但会议是否能获得真正的进展，并不完全取决于苏联。全世界人民关心日内瓦会议，期待西方外长搬去它们所设置的绊脚石，使会议能够获得肯定的结果。
