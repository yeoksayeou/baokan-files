The Institute of Psychology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences recently invited psychology workers from Peking University, Beijing Normal University, the Institute of Educational Sciences, Beijing Normal College, and other related units to hold a symposium on psychological issues, and discussed some academic issues involved in the movement to criticize bourgeois tendencies in the field of psychology last year.

The criticism of bourgeois tendencies in psychology last year was a mass criticism movement that swept the country. The purpose of this criticism was mainly to examine the bourgeois ideology and viewpoints existing in psychological teaching and research work since liberation, and to expose and criticize the erroneous tendencies in psychology since liberation, such as being seriously divorced from reality, divorced from the masses, and neglecting to understand human psychological activities from the perspective of the social essence of human beings. It should be affirmed that the achievements made by Chinese psychology workers in studying Marxism and advanced Soviet psychological science and attempting to establish Chinese Marxist psychology since liberation cannot be obliterated. However, because most psychology workers do not have a sufficient grasp of Marxism, and the influence of bourgeois academic thought has not been eradicated, some psychologists, when making a materialist understanding of psychological phenomena, committed one-sidedness in their understanding of the Marxist psychological principle that "psychology is the function of the brain and a reflection of objective reality." They emphasized that psychology is "the function of the brain" and neglected that it is "a reflection of objective reality," resulting in disregard for the social essence of psychological activities, analyzing certain class-based psychological activities one-sidedly from a physiological perspective, and even describing the anti-Party words and deeds of rightists as a matter of character or type, rather than a political issue. Criticism of these erroneous tendencies is entirely necessary. It has a great effect on eliminating the influence of bourgeois academic thought in psychology, reversing the tendency of psychology to be seriously divorced from reality, and improving the Marxist-Leninist ideological level of psychology workers, and therefore the achievements are positive.

In last year's criticism movement, some academic issues in psychology were also touched upon. For example, the disciplinary nature of psychology (whether it is a social science, a natural science, or a marginal science), research objects and tasks (researching the common psychological laws of all mankind or the psychological laws of classes, as well as the relationship between physiology and psychology), research methods (whether other methods can be applied in addition to the class analysis method), and other issues. Because the focus of the criticism was mainly on the bourgeois direction, although these academic issues were also raised at the time, they were not well resolved. Some comrades also failed to clearly distinguish these academic issues from bourgeois ideology in their criticisms, which caused some ideological confusion in the field of psychology. Therefore, it is necessary to further discuss these academic issues to seek a more consistent view. The symposium held by the Institute of Psychology this time can be said to be the beginning of this discussion.

The main issues and opinions of this symposium are described below.

I. Objects and Tasks of Psychology

Most comrades disagree with the view that there are no psychological laws common to all mankind; the main task of psychology is to study the laws of the formation and development of communist consciousness.

Cao Richang believes that the main issue to be studied in psychology is "how matter thinks." He said: "Solving the problem of how matter generates consciousness, how to reflect objective existence—that is, the problem of the origin of consciousness and the process of reflection—is the main task of psychology." He believes that psychology should study both psychological phenomena that have class influence and those that do not. Wang Su believes that human psychological activities and psychological processes studied by psychology are formed and developed in society. It is undeniable that class nature restricts and influences the formation of these processes, but "the restriction of human psychological activities by class and the existence of common laws of psychological activities are not mutually exclusive"; psychology should study both common laws and special laws. Liu Shiyi believes that human consciousness is what psychology should study, but the task of studying the laws of the formation and development of social consciousness is mainly the task of historical materialism, and psychology focuses on studying the reflection process. Zhu Zhixian also agrees that mankind has common psychological laws. He said: "From the premise that the essence of man is the sum of social relations and has class nature, it cannot be deduced that psychology has class nature. For example, physiology does not have class nature simply because it studies people." Peng Fei believes that there are common psychological laws and special psychological laws. He said that human consciousness is not abstract, but a subjective reflection of the outside world, and different classes always have different characteristics. Therefore, psychology should study common laws and also reveal special laws.

II. The Disciplinary Nature of Psychology

Cao Richang believes that psychology is a "cross-border science" between social sciences (including disciplines with class nature and those without, such as language) and natural sciences. The emergence of consciousness is the result of the development of the natural world, and the study of this aspect of phenomena in psychology belongs to natural science; consciousness is closely related to labor, language, etc., and the study of this part, which is inseparable from social phenomena, can be said to be social science. Wang Su believes that human psychological phenomena have a social side and a natural side, and are a high degree of synthesis of society and nature. Therefore, psychology, which studies this synthetic phenomenon, should belong to "marginal science" in terms of its disciplinary nature. Long Shuxiu believes that psychology is a social science and also a natural science. His main arguments are:
(1) The human individual studied by psychology is, on the one hand, the sum of social relations, and on the other hand, a material entity—that is, it has both the nature of a social science and the nature of a natural science. (2) The world is unified, and social sciences and natural sciences cannot be completely separated; social science is humanistic science, and humanistic science itself has a social side and also a natural side. (3) From the perspective that psychological activity is a reflection of the objective world, what it reflects includes social phenomena and natural phenomena.

The above speakers all believe that it is inappropriate to classify psychology entirely as a social science. However, Zhu Zhixian believes that the issue of human class nature in psychology is a relatively complex issue, because it is difficult to separate any psychological process from consciousness, and it is difficult to avoid involving the content of consciousness when talking about consciousness. The relationship between consciousness and human psychological processes, how subjective initiative plays a role, and other issues need to be clarified. Peng Fei also believes that because the relationship between form and content, the issue of class nature and common laws, and the connotation of psychological phenomena in psychology have not been clarified, the nature of psychology as a science still needs to be further studied.

III. Should Psychology Study Physiological Mechanisms?

Many comrades believe that it is necessary for psychology to study physiological mechanisms. Liu Shiyi believes that it is wrong to oppose physiology and psychology, or even to believe that the application of Pavlov's theory in psychology hinders the development of psychology. In research work, psychological function should not be opposed to brain function; the study of brain function is the key to studying the reflection process and the cognitive process. Long Shuxiu said: "The human individual is connected with brain function. Psychology can only become a reliable science if it pays attention to the study of the material entity (the brain)." Peng Fei also said that Pavlov's theory should be studied, but he believes that the study of the social aspects of psychology should not be ignored. Zhu Zhixian believes that it is wrong to deny the role of Pavlov's theory in the struggle against idealistic psychology, but the question is how to solve psychological problems from a physiological perspective. If problems are solved solely by relying on physiology, one may embark on the path of mechanical materialism. Chen Yuanhui said that it was wrong for some people to oppose Pavlov's theory in the past under the pretext of criticizing "biologization."

IV. Research Methods of Psychology

Chen Yuanhui strongly opposed the view that the class analysis method should be implemented in all research content of psychology and that the experimental method should be completely abolished. He believes that class analysis is not feasible in the study of child psychology, and it is also inappropriate to conduct class analysis of sensation and perception. Long Shuxiu believes that class analysis is the main method of social science, not the main method of psychology. Liu Shiyi believes that in addition to combining with physiology, psychological research should also be widely combined with other sciences, such as physics, chemistry, mathematics, etc., and use various methods to clarify the laws of brain reflection. He also said that this is an important way to eliminate the backward phenomena of psychology.

V. How Should Psychology Connect with Reality?

Regarding this issue, some preliminary exchanges of views were made at the symposium. For example, Wang Su believes that the scope and objects of psychological research are very broad, but at present, it should mainly be linked to labor, education, and medicine. Xu Feixi believes that elucidating the pathological changes of the reflection process itself in certain psychiatric patients from the study of medical psychology not only has clinical significance, but also helps the study of psychological laws. Chen Yuanhui emphasized that connecting with reality should "concentrate efforts, break through one point, and affect the overall situation."

This symposium is only the beginning of the debate on psychological issues. Although there were differences of opinion in the speeches, it only raised some preliminary issues, which remain to be discussed in depth.

### 中国科学院心理研究所等单位  举行心理学问题座谈会

    中国科学院心理研究所等单位
    举行心理学问题座谈会
    中国科学院心理研究所最近邀请北京大学、北京师范大学、教育科学研究所、北京师范学院等有关单位的心理学工作者，举行了心理学问题座谈会，对去年心理学界开展资产阶级方向批判运动中所涉及的一些学术性问题进行了座谈。
    去年关于心理学中资产阶级方向的批判，是一次遍及全国的群众性批判运动。这次批判的目的，主要是检查解放以来心理学教学和研究工作中存在着的资产阶级思想、观点，揭露和批判解放以来心理学中严重脱离实际、脱离群众、忽视从人的社会实质方面去理解人的心理活动等错误倾向。应该肯定，解放以来我国心理学工作者在学习马克思主义和苏联的先进心理科学，试图建立中国马克思主义心理学方面所获得的成绩是不能抹煞的。但由于一般心理学工作者对马克思主义的掌握还很不够，资产阶级学术思想的影响还没有肃清，因此，部分心理学家当他们对心理现象作唯物主义理解的时候，对于“心理是大脑的机能、客观现实的反映”这一马克思主义心理学的原则的理解犯了片面性。他们强调了心理是“大脑的机能”，而忽视了它是“客观现实的反映”这一方面，以致造成无视心理活动的社会实质，对某些具有阶级性的心理活动片面地从生理学去分析，甚至把右派分子的反党言行说成是性格或类型问题，而不是政治问题。对这些错误倾向的批判是完全必要的。它对于清除心理学中的资产阶级学术思想的影响，扭转心理学严重脱离实际的倾向，提高心理学工作者的马克思列宁主义思想水平，具有很大的作用，因而成绩是肯定的。
    在去年批判运动中，也还接触到心理学的一些学术性问题。例如心理学的学科性质（是社会科学抑是自然科学或边缘科学）、研究对象和任务（研究全人类共同的心理规律抑阶级心理规律，以及生理与心理的关系）、研究方法（阶级分析法之外是否还能应用其他方法）等问题。由于批判的锋芒主要是针对资产阶级的方向，当时这些学术性问题虽然也提了出来，但并未能很好解决。有些同志在批判中也尚未把这些学术性问题与资产阶级思想区分得很清楚，以致在心理学界中曾引起了一些思想混乱。因此，有必要对这些学术问题进一步开展讨论，求取比较一致的看法。心理研究所这次召开的座谈会，可说是这一讨论的开始。
    现将这次座谈的主要问题和意见分述于下。
    一、心理学的对象和任务
    多数同志不同意这样的一种观点，即认为全人类的心理规律是没有的；心理学的主要任务是研究共产主义意识形成和发展的规律。
    曹日昌认为心理学要研究的主要问题是“物质是怎样思惟的”。他说：“解决物质如何产生意识，如何反映客观存在——即意识的起源问题及反映的过程问题，就是心理学的主要任务”。他认为心理学对有阶级影响的心理现象和没有阶级影响的心理现象都应加以研究。王苏认为：心理学所研究的人的心理活动及心理过程等都是在社会中形成和发展的，不可否认，阶级性是制约和影响着这些过程的形成的，但“人的心理活动受阶级所制约，和心理活动有共同规律，并不是互相排斥的”；心理学对于共同规律和特殊规律都应研究。刘世熠认为人的意识是心理学应该研究的，但研究社会意识的形成和发展规律主要是历史唯物主义的任务，心理学着重研究反映过程。朱智贤也同意人类有共同心理规律。他说：“从人的实质是社会关系的总和、是有阶级性的这个前提出发，并不能推论出心理学都有阶级性。例如生理学并不因为它研究人，就有阶级性。”彭飞认为人类有共同的心理规律存在，也有特殊的心理规律存在。他说，人的意识不是抽象的，而是外界的主观映像，不同阶级总有不同特点，因此，心理学要研究共同的规律，也应揭露特殊的规律。
    二、心理学的学科性质
    曹日昌认为心理学是社会科学（包括有阶级性的和没有阶级性的学科——如语言）和自然科学之间的“跨界科学”。意识产生是自然界发展的结果，心理学研究这方面的现象属于自然科学；意识与劳动、语言等密切联系着，研究与社会现象不可分的这一部分，可说是社会科学。王苏认为，人的心理现象有其社会的一面，也有其自然的一面，是社会和自然的高度的综合，因此研究这种综合现象的心理学，它的学科性质应属于“边缘科学”。龙叔修认为心理学是社会科学，同时也是自然科学。他的主要论点是：
  （1）心理学研究的人类个体，一方面是社会关系的总和，一方面又是物质的实体——即带有社会科学性质也带有自然科学性质。（2）世界是统一的，社会科学与自然科学不可能完全截然分开；社会科学是人文科学，人文科学本身就带有社会一面，也有自然一面。（3）从心理活动是客观世界的反映来看，它所反映的有社会现象，也有自然现象。
    以上的发言者，都认为把心理学完全列入社会科学是不妥当的。但朱智贤认为人的阶级性问题在心理学中是一个比较复杂的问题，因为谈到任何心理过程都很难与意识分开，谈到意识都难免涉及意识的内容。意识与人的心理过程关系如何，主观能动性如何起作用等问题都有待于明确。彭飞也认为，由于心理学中形式与内容的关系问题、阶级性与共同规律问题、心理现象的内涵等问题尚未明确，因此心理学应属于什么性质的科学尚有待于进一步研究。三、心理学应否研究生理机制
    不少同志认为心理学研究生理机制是必要的。刘世熠认为，把生理和心理对立起来，甚至认为在心理学中运用巴甫洛夫学说是阻碍心理学的发展，这种论点是错误的。在研究工作中不应把心理与大脑机能对立起来；大脑机能的研究是研究反映过程和认识过程的关键问题。龙叔修说：“人类个体与大脑机能是联系着的。心理学只有注意物质本体（大脑）的研究，才能成为一门可靠的科学。”彭飞也说，巴甫洛夫学说应该研究，但他认为也不能忽视心理的社会方面的研究。朱智贤认为不承认巴甫洛夫学说在对唯心主义心理学斗争中的作用是不对的，但问题是到底如何从生理方面来解决心理学问题。如果单靠生理来解决问题，又可能会走上机械唯物论的道路。陈元辉说，过去有人借口批判“生物学化”而反对巴甫洛夫学说，那是错误的。
    四、心理学的研究方法
    陈元辉在会上极力反对在心理学全部研究内容中，均应贯彻阶级分析法和根本废除实验法的说法。他认为阶级分析对儿童心理学的研究是行不通的，对感觉知觉进行阶级分析也是不妥当的。龙叔修认为阶级分析是社会科学的主要方法，不是心理学的主要方法。刘世熠认为，心理学的研究除应该和生理学结合之外，还应该广泛地和其他科学，如物理学、化学、数学等结合，用各种各样的方法来阐明大脑的反映规律。并说，这是消灭心理学落后现象的重要途径。
    五、心理学怎样联系实际
    关于这个问题，在座谈会上初步交换了一些意见。如王苏认为心理学研究范围和对象很广，但目前主要应联系劳动、教育和医学。徐飞锡认为，从医学心理学的研究阐明某些精神病患者的反映过程本身的病理变化，不但具有临床意义，也有助于心理规律的探讨。陈元辉强调联系实际应“集中力量、攻破一点、影响全局。”
    这次座谈会只是心理学问题争鸣的开始，虽然在发言中存在着意见分歧，但它只是初步提出了一些问题，尚待深入讨论。
