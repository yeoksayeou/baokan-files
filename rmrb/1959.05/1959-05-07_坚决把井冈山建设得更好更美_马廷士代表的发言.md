Comrade Chairman, fellow representatives:

I fully agree with the Government Work Report made by Premier Zhou Enlai. I fully agree with the reports of Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and I guarantee to implement them in future work.

I would now like to report to the congress on some information about the cradle of the revolution - Jinggang Mountain.

Jinggang Mountain is located in the middle of the Luoxiao Mountains, centered on the Upper, Middle, Lower, Big, and Small Five Wells, and Ciping, Baiyin Lake, and Xiazhuang (including Maoping and Dalong). It is surrounded by five major passes: Tongmu Ridge, Zhusha Chong, Shuangma Stone, Bame Mountain, and Wangyangjie, which were also known as the five major sentry posts after the Red Army ascended Jinggang Mountain. Jinggang Mountain is a place of towering mountains, overlapping peaks, steep cliffs, and dangerous terrain, with the main peak reaching an altitude of 1,800 meters. Above ground, it is covered with dense forests and various wild plants; underground, it has abundant mineral deposits of iron, tungsten, gold, and other resources. It contains extremely rich natural wealth and various valuable resources. The people in the Jinggang Mountain area say: "Heroic Jinggang Mountain, stands tall amidst white clouds, ascend to the highest peak, three and a third feet from the sky, flowers bloom in all seasons, treasures fill the mountains, glorious and great, the number one mountain under heaven." This illustrates the danger, magnificence, richness, and greatness of Jinggang Mountain.

The cradle of the revolution—Jinggang Mountain, was China's first revolutionary base.

In the summer of 1927, Chiang Kai-shek colluded with imperialists to betray the revolution, massacring a large number of Communist Party members and revolutionary masses, causing a serious defeat in the First Revolutionary Civil War. In order to lead the Chinese people to continue the revolutionary struggle against Chiang Kai-shek's betrayal, the Chinese Communist Party, in the autumn of 1927, organized and led the famous Autumn Harvest Uprising in Pingjiang and Liuyang. In October of the same year, Chairman Mao led the peasant self-defense army from the Pingjiang and Liuyang uprisings, the Anyuan worker picket team, and part of the Wuhan Garrison Regiment to Jinggang Mountain. At the end of April 1928, Vice Chairman Zhu De led part of the armed forces from the Nanchang "August 1st" Uprising from southern Hunan to Ninggang, where they joined forces with Chairman Mao in Longshi, forming the Fourth Red Army and the Xianggan Border Special Committee. Under the correct leadership of Chairman Mao, the first revolutionary base area in the Xianggan border region was established, with Jinggang Mountain as its center. The spark of Jinggang Mountain ignited the entire Chinese land, and after more than thirty years of struggle, a great victory in the democratic revolution and socialist revolution was finally achieved throughout the country. Jinggang Mountain has written a glorious page in Chinese revolutionary history, and it is well-known in the hearts of people across the country and around the world. It has been hailed by the broad masses as the number one revolutionary mountain under heaven.

The people of the Jinggang Mountain area, under the direct leadership of Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Zhu, from the winter of 1927 to the end of 1928, supported the Red Army with manpower, materials, and financial resources to smash the Kuomintang's three encirclements of Jinggang Mountain, making tremendous contributions. After the Red Army withdrew from Jinggang Mountain in the spring of 1929, they also suffered large-scale massacres and destruction by the Kuomintang reactionaries. For example, Jinggangshan Township had more than 3,000 people before 1928. Due to the Kuomintang's large-scale massacres, only more than 1,200 people remained by the time of liberation in 1949 (now it has recovered to more than 2,600 people), houses were almost completely burned down, and possessions were looted. However, the people of Jinggang Mountain not only did not succumb to the enemy, but instead more resolutely waged a tenacious and long-term struggle against them.

The heroic people of Jinggang Mountain, carrying forward their revolutionary spirit, have developed the mountainous areas and built up the mountainous areas. In recent years, transportation and cultural and educational undertakings have developed by leaps and bounds, and people's lives have been improved and improved year by year.

Since liberation, the people of Jinggang Mountain, following Chairman Mao's instruction to "Carry forward the revolutionary tradition and strive for greater glory," and with the care and help of the Communist Party and the People's Government, have vigorously restored and developed production, built houses, and rebuilt their homes, so that the living standards of the masses have been improved and improved year by year. In particular, grain, which has never been sufficient in the past, and people had to cross high mountains and steep ridges to carry grain from the foot of the mountain to the top to eat. After 1953, the people of Jinggang Mountain not only did not lack grain, but also sold more than 100,000 jin of surplus grain to the state every year.

In order to develop the mountainous areas and build the mountainous areas, in the winter of 1957, more than 50,000 cadres in the province went to the mountains and countryside to participate in labor production. Among them, more than 700 cadres and demobilized soldiers established state-owned comprehensive reclamation farms on Jinggang Mountain. They worked with the people of Jinggang Mountain to develop and build Jinggang Mountain. In March 1958, the Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial People's Committee decided to build a highway from Taihe to Jinggang Mountain. Under the leadership of the local Party and government, the masses of Jinggang Mountain and its surrounding areas, with more than 100,000 migrant workers, braved the wind and rain, day and night, to cut through thorns and break rocks, making high mountains bow their heads and rivers give way. After three months of hard work, a flat and wide mountain highway with a total length of 110 kilometers was finally completed three months ahead of schedule and officially opened to traffic on July 1, 1958. The completion of this highway created extremely favorable conditions for the development and construction of Jinggang Mountain. It is also the long-cherished wish and demand of the people of Jinggang Mountain and the surrounding old revolutionary base areas.

On August 1, 1958, the Jinggang Mountain branch of the Communist Labor University officially opened. More than 800 young men and women students from all over the province and neighboring provinces and Shanghai enthusiastically studied and worked in production at the Jinggang Mountain branch. This branch was established based on the principle of combining work-study, half-work and half-study, and combining education with productive labor. All teachers and students were united, in a happy mood, and full of enthusiasm, studying and working at the same time. In addition to attending classes according to the plan, they also actively participated in labor production. In less than nine months from the establishment of the school in August last year to the present, they have been able to achieve self-sufficiency in solving the school's funding and students' living expenses. Now they have become a new force in the construction of Jinggang Mountain.

Although the Jinggang Mountain Reclamation Farm has only been established for more than a year, it has achieved remarkable results in industrial and agricultural production due to the implementation of the operating principle of simultaneously developing industry and agriculture and combining agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline occupations, and fisheries.

In industry: the factories that have been built and are under construction include: wood processing factories, paper mills, wineries, perfume factories, rosin factories, rayon factories, iron and steel plants, cement plants, and brick and tile factories. In addition, a 650-kilowatt hydroelectric power station is currently under construction and is scheduled to be completed and generate electricity on July 1 this year.

In agriculture: the cadres used their own hands and hoes to cultivate more than 600 mu of wasteland. The reclaimed wasteland has been planted with sweet potatoes, potatoes, tobacco, ginger, peppers, and various vegetables. At the same time, 21,451 mu of Chinese fir trees, 8,711 mu of tung oil trees, 432 mu of various fruit trees, 254 mu of walnuts and chestnuts have been planted, and more than 30 mu of various tree seedlings have been cultivated. In animal husbandry and sideline production: Xinjiang fine wool sheep farms, pig farms, rabbit farms, and bee farms have been established.

In terms of infrastructure construction: the Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial People's Committee have decided to build a revolutionary museum, a martyrs' memorial tower, a library, the Jinggang Mountain Hotel, a department store, and other projects this year. It has also been decided to add three more highways from Ninggang to Jinggang Mountain, Yongxin to Jinggang Mountain, and Suichuan to Jinggang Mountain, and to require that all of them be open to traffic before National Day this year.

Heroic Jinggang Mountain, we plan to strive to build it into a socialist and communist Jinggang Mountain in the next ten to fifteen years or even longer. Let it always shine with brilliant light, not only was it the number one mountain under heaven in the past revolution, but it will still be the number one mountain under heaven in the future socialist and communist construction.

We must build Jinggang Mountain to be more beautiful.

Under the new situation of the nationwide socialist great leap forward, due to the opening of the Jinggang Mountain Highway, the establishment of the state-owned comprehensive reclamation farm and the Jinggang Mountain branch of the Communist Labor University, the unity of cadres and the masses, and the improvement of political and ideological levels, the development and construction of Jinggang Mountain has entered a new period. As mentioned above, thanks to the hard work of the people of Jinggang Mountain, the cadres of the reclamation farm, and all the teachers and students of the Communist Labor University, a lot of work has been done in the development and construction of Jinggang Mountain, and certain achievements have been made. The achievements are inseparable from the cordial care of Chairman Mao and the Central Committee and the strong support and help of relevant departments of the Central Committee and fraternal provinces. Please allow me to express my heartfelt thanks on behalf of the people of Jinggang Mountain. In view of the arduous construction tasks in the future, coupled with the revolutionary historical sites left by the revolutionary predecessors, which we are not very clear about, it is suggested that relevant departments of the Central Committee give strong support and guidance in terms of financial resources, materials, and historical data of Jinggang Mountain in the future construction of Jinggang Mountain. At the same time, it is also hoped that all fraternal provinces will provide assistance and support to the construction of Jinggang Mountain in all aspects.

In order to strengthen the leadership over the development and construction of Jinggang Mountain and complete this arduous and glorious task, the Jiangxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Provincial People's Government have decided to establish the Jinggang Mountain Construction Committee and the Jinggang Mountain Administration Bureau, which will be directly led by the province. The area under the jurisdiction of the Administration Bureau includes the entire Ninggang County (except Hanjiang Township), Ciping Township in Suichuan County, and Nashan Township in Yongxin County, with a total population of 50,000, and a large amount of bamboo, wood, and abundant mineral deposits. In this way, there is a relatively solid material foundation for the construction of Jinggang Mountain, whether in terms of manpower, material resources, or financial resources.

We believe that under the wise and correct leadership of the Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and with the strong support of relevant departments of the Central Committee and all fraternal provinces and cities across the country, we will definitely be able to build Jinggang Mountain better and more beautiful.

Please correct the above speech if it is inappropriate.

### 坚决把井冈山建设得更好更美  马廷士代表的发言

　　坚决把井冈山建设得更好更美
    马廷士代表的发言主席、各位代表：
    我完全同意周恩来总理所作的政府工作报告。完全同意李富春、李先念副总理和彭真副委员长的报告，并保证在今后工作中贯彻执行。
    我现在就革命摇篮——井冈山的一些情况向大会汇报。
    井冈山位于罗霄山脉的中段，它以上、中、下、大、小五井和茨平、白银湖、下庄等地为中心（包括茅坪、大垅），四周有桐木岭、朱砂冲、双马石、八面山、汪洋界五大要口，也是红军上井冈山以后，所称的五大哨口。井冈山是丛山峻岭，峰峦重迭，悬崖陡壁，地势险要，主峰高达海拔1800公尺。在地面上，满山遍野生长着密茂的森林和各种野生植物；在地下有大量的铁、钨、金等各种矿藏，它蕴藏着极为丰富的自然财富和各种各样的宝贵资源。井冈山区的群众说：“英雄井冈山，屹立白云间，登上最高峰，离天三尺三，鲜花四季开，琳琅满山间，光荣又伟大，天下第一山。”这就说明井冈山的险要、雄壮、富饶和伟大。
    革命的摇篮——井冈山，是中国革命的第一个根据地
    在一九二七年夏季，国民党蒋介石勾结帝国主义叛变了革命，大批屠杀共产党员与革命群众，使第一次国内革命战争造成严重失败。中国共产党为了领导中国人民继续坚持革命斗争，反对蒋介石的叛变革命。毛主席在一九二七年秋季，于平江、浏阳组织与领导了著名的秋收起义。在同年十月间，毛主席率领平江、浏阳起义的农民自卫军、安源工人纠察队和武汉警备团一部分武装，登上了井冈山。一九二八年四月底，朱德副主席率领南昌“八一”起义的一部分武装，由湘南来到宁冈在砻市和毛主席会师，成立了红四军和湘赣边特委。在毛主席的正确领导下，以井冈山为中心，首先创立了湘赣边全国第一个革命根据地。井冈山的星星之火，烧红了整个中国大地，经过三十多年的斗争，终于在全国范围内获得了民主革命和社会主义革命的伟大胜利。井冈山这个地方，它在中国革命史上写下了光辉灿烂的一页，无论在全国和全世界人民心目中，都是很著名的，它已为广大人民群众封为革命的天下第一山。
    井冈山地区的人民，在毛主席和朱副主席的直接领导下，在一九二七年冬至一九二八年底，他们以人力、物力、财力，支援红军粉碎国民党三次围剿井冈山，曾作过巨大的贡献。在一九二九年春，红军退出井冈山以后，他们也遭受了国民党反动派的大批屠杀与摧残。如井冈山乡，在一九二八年以前有三千多人，由于国民党进行大批屠杀，到一九四九年解放时仅剩下一千二百多人（现在已经恢复到二千六百多人），房屋几乎被烧光，东西被抢光。但是井冈山的人民，不但没有向敌人屈服，反而更加坚决地向敌人进行顽强的长期斗争。
    英雄的井冈山人民，发扬了革命干劲，开发山区，建设山区，几年来交通、文化教育事业有了飞跃的发展，人民生活逐年得到提高与改善
    自解放以后，井冈山的人民，遵循着毛主席“发扬革命传统，争取更大光荣”的指示和共产党、人民政府的关怀与帮助，大力的恢复与发展了生产，修建房屋，重建家园，使群众生活水平逐年得到改善与提高。特别是粮食，过去历来就不够吃，不得不翻高山、越陡岭，从山下挑粮食到山上吃，到一九五三年以后，井冈山人民不但不缺粮，反而每年都有十多万斤余粮卖给国家。
    为了开发山区，建设山区，一九五七年冬，全省有五万多干部上山下乡参加劳动生产，其中有七百多名干部和转业军官，在井冈山上建立了国营综合垦殖场，他们和井冈山人民一道开发和建设井冈山。省委和省人委于一九五八年三月，决定修建由泰和通往井冈山的公路。在当地党政领导下，井冈山及其周围的群众，十余万民工栉风沐雨，夜以继日地斩荆棘、破岩石，要高山低头，要河水让路，经过三个月的苦战，一条全长一百一十公里平坦宽阔的登山公路，终于提前三个月建成，一九五八年七月一日正式通车。这条公路的建成，为开发和建设井冈山创造了极为有利的条件。也是井冈山和周围的老革命根据地的人民多年来的热望和要求。
    一九五八年八月一日共产主义劳动大学井冈山分校正式开学了，来自全省各地和邻省、上海市等地八百多名青年男女学生，到井冈山分校热情地学习与劳动生产。这个分校是根据勤工俭学、半工半读、教育与生产劳动相结合的方针举办的。全体师生团结一致，心情舒畅，情绪饱满，边学习、边劳动。由于他们除按照计划上课外，还积极参加劳动生产，自去年八月建校到现在不到九个月的时间，对于解决办校经费和学生的生活费用已经能够作到自给。现在他们已成为建设井冈山的一支新生力量。
    井冈山垦殖场，建场时间虽然仅仅一年多，由于贯彻执行了工农业同时并举和农、林、牧、副、渔相结合的经营方针，因此，在工农业生产方面都获得了显著成绩
    在工业方面：已经建成和正在兴建的工厂有：木材加工厂、造纸厂、酿酒厂、香料厂、松香厂、人造纤维厂、炼铁厂、水泥厂和砖瓦厂等。此外，现正建设一座六百五十瓩的水电站，今年七月一日就可以竣工发电。
    在农业上：干部们用自己的双手，拿着锄头开垦荒地六百多亩。所开垦的荒地都种上了红薯、马铃薯、烟叶、生姜、辣椒和各种蔬菜。同时，还栽了杉树二万一千四百五十一亩，油桐八千七百一十一亩，各种果树四百三十二亩，核桃、板栗二百五十四亩，培育各种树苗三十多亩。在畜牧业和副业生产方面：已建立了新疆细羊毛场、养猪场、养兔场和养蜂场等。
    在基建方面：省委和省人委决定今年修建革命博物馆、烈士纪念塔、图书馆、井冈山宾馆、百货商店等工程。并决定再增修宁冈到井冈山、永新到井冈山、遂川到井冈山的三条公路，要求在今年的国庆节前全部通车。
    英雄的井冈山，我们计划在今后十年至十五年或者更长一点的时间，争取把它建设成为社会主义、共产主义井冈山。使它永远闪烁着灿烂的光芒，不仅过去革命是天下第一山，而且在今后社会主义和共产主义建设中仍然是天下第一山。
    一定要把井冈山建设得更美丽
    在全国社会主义大跃进的新形势下，由于井冈山公路的通车，国营综合垦殖场和共产主义劳动大学井冈山分校的建立，干部和群众团结一致和政治思想水平的提高，这就使今后开发与建设井冈山，已进入了一个新的时期。上面已经说过，由于井冈山人民和垦殖场的干部与共产主义劳动大学全体师生的艰苦努力，对于开发和建设井冈山作了不少工作，也取得了一定的成绩。这些成绩的取得，是由于毛主席和中央的亲切关怀和中央有关部门以及兄弟省的大力支援与帮助分不开的，请允许我代表井冈山人民特致以衷心的谢意。鉴于今后建设任务繁重，加之革命先辈遗留下来的革命史迹，我们还不太清楚，因此，在今后对井冈山的建设中，建议中央各有关部门，在财力、物力和井冈山的历史资料等方面给以大力支援和指导。同时，也希望各兄弟省对井冈山的建设，在各方面给予援助和支持。
    为了加强对开发与建设井冈山的领导，完成这一艰巨而光荣的任务，中共江西省委和省人民委员会已决定成立了井冈山建设委员会和井冈山管理局，由省直接领导。管理局所辖范围，包括宁冈全县（除韩江乡）、遂川县的茨坪乡和永新县的拿山乡，共有五万人口，并有大量的竹子、木头和丰富的矿藏。这样，无论从人力、物力、财力方面，对于建设井冈山都有较雄厚的物质基础。
    我们相信在中央和毛主席的英明正确领导下，在中央各有关部门和全国各兄弟省、市的大力支持下，一定能够把井冈山建设得更好更美。
    以上发言，是否妥当，请主席团和各位代表指正。
