Fushun, May 29 (Reported by this newspaper) – In the large-scale bumper harvest movement, the Zibo Mining Bureau of Shandong Province, leading cadres grasped both coal mining and tunneling, making the connection of coal mining faces relatively normal and coal production steadily rising. The Xinwen Mining Bureau, due to emphasizing mining over tunneling and one-sidedly pursuing output, resulted in tunneling lagging far behind mining. The connection of working faces became tense, causing a rapid decline in coal production and a passive situation.

Since the launch of the large-scale bumper harvest movement in March this year, the amount of coal obtained from tunneling at the Zibo Mining Bureau has increased every month, and coal production has risen step by step. The average daily output in March was more than 600 tons higher than in February, and in April it was more than 100 tons higher than in March. May has also seen an increase. However, the amount of coal obtained by the Xinwen Mining Bureau has been decreasing month by month. The total coal production of the mine was 220,000 tons in February, rising to 310,000 tons in March, but dropping to over 260,000 tons in April, and continuing to decline in May. It has failed to meet the state plan every month this year. Two mines are already in a state of semi-shutdown due to the failure to connect preparation working faces.

The production tasks of both mining bureaus this year are greater than last year. The planned annual output of Zibo Coal Mine is nearly 50% higher than the actual output last year; Xinwen Coal Mine will have two pairs of large shafts and nine pairs of small shafts put into production this year, and the planned output this year will be doubled. Faced with these heavy tasks, the two coal mines adopted two completely different approaches based on two different understandings, resulting in such a wide disparity in results.

In the Great Leap Forward last year, Zibo Coal Mine once focused on output and neglected tunneling. At the end of the year, although the increase in coal production was significant, the amount of coal obtained from tunneling decreased by one-half, meaning that half of the old capital had been eaten up. At the beginning of this year, the Party Committee of Zibo Mining Bureau looked back on the past, looked at the present, and thought about the future, educating employees to overcome the ideology of emphasizing mining over tunneling, and put forward the action slogan of "high yield on all faces, rapid advance on all headings," launching a large-scale bumper harvest and rapid tunneling competition throughout the mine.

While strengthening production leadership, this coal mine has strengthened leadership over tunneling work in all aspects. From the bureau to the mine to each wellhead, leading cadres have been assigned responsibilities for production and tunneling. On the basis of mobilizing the masses to speak out freely, a large-scale bumper harvest plan was drawn up on the one hand, and a tunneling work plan was drawn up on the other. Key tunneling faces were included in the scheduling plan in order to reflect the on-site situation in a timely manner and analyze the problems in tunneling in a timely manner. The bureau leaders also clearly stipulated that tunneling teams can only be strengthened, not weakened.

In order to effectively increase output and give full play to the maximum efficiency of production preparation work, all mines have insisted on implementing regular cyclical operations and promoted the experience of double-cycle and multi-cycle in different working faces.

Xinwen Coal Mine, under the condition that the production task this year is relatively heavy, has opposed production and tunneling, and has produced the one-sided thinking of "emphasizing mining and neglecting tunneling." Therefore, although the contradiction between tunneling and production not being adapted to each other was already severely exposed in the fourth quarter of last year, and some mines had less than one month's worth of coal reserves left, tunneling work this year has still not received sufficient attention, but instead, output has been pursued blindly. In March, the bureau held two conferences, both of which were about output. In order to achieve high output and report good news, some mines and mining areas "ate the fat and discarded the lean," indiscriminately mining and tunneling. Some mines even transferred tunneling workers to coal mining faces, making the connection between mining and tunneling increasingly tense. The leaders of the mining bureau made several phone calls every day, and sometimes went down to the mines in person to pursue high output. The rapid tunneling experience of Sun Village Coal Mine of Xinwen Mining Bureau was once summarized by the Ministry of Coal Industry as one of the 36 national experiences, but it was not promoted in Xinwen Mining Bureau. As a result, although the coal production of the whole bureau jumped to 310,000 tons in March (an increase of 40% over February), tunneling work fell far behind. By April, some mines did not have a single preparation working face, and some mines had only enough coal reserves for a few days of mining. This forced the whole bureau to start a sharp decline in coal production from April. Now, Xinwen Mining Bureau is concentrating its efforts to strengthen tunneling work, striving to reverse the passive situation in a relatively short period of time.

The Shandong Coal Industry Administration is summarizing the experiences and lessons of these two coal mines to educate cadres in all mines to establish comprehensive thinking, strive to achieve a balance between mining and tunneling before October, and ensure a steady increase in coal production.

### 采煤、掘进不能单打一  淄博矿务局一手抓采煤一手抓掘进煤产量稳步上升  新汶矿务局重采煤轻掘进工作被动煤产量急速下降

    采煤、掘进不能单打一
    淄博矿务局一手抓采煤一手抓掘进煤产量稳步上升
    新汶矿务局重采煤轻掘进工作被动煤产量急速下降
    本报抚顺29日电　山东省淄博矿务局在大面积丰产运动中，领导干部一手抓采煤，一手抓掘进，使采煤工作面接续比较正常，煤炭产量稳步上升；新汶矿务局由于重采轻掘，片面追求产量，结果掘进大大落后于采煤，工作面接续紧张，造成煤炭产量急速下降的被动局面。
    今年3月份开展大面积丰产运动以来，淄博矿务局掘进出来的获得煤量每月都有增加，煤炭产量随之步步上升，平均日产3月份比2月份多六百多吨，4月份比3月份多一百多吨，5月份又有所提高。新汶矿务局的获得煤量却在逐月减少。全矿的煤炭产量，2月份为二十二万吨，3月份提高到三十一万吨，4月份却降低到二十六万多吨，5月份又继续下降，今年来月月完不成国家计划。有两个矿由于准备工作面接续不上，已经处在半停产状态。
    这两个矿务局今年的生产任务都比去年大。淄博煤矿全年计划产量比去年实际产量提高近50％；新汶煤矿今年将有两对大井、九对小井投入生产，今年计划产量提高一倍。两个煤矿面对着这繁重的任务，在两种认识基础上，采取了两种截然不同的做法，因而得到如此悬殊的结果。
    淄博煤矿在去年大跃进中，曾经因为偏重产量，忽视掘进，一年终了，煤炭产量增长幅度虽然很大，而掘进获得煤量却下降二分之一，也就是说把老本吃掉了一半。今年开始，淄博矿务局党委就瞻望过去，看着今天，想到明天，教育职工克服重采轻掘思想，提出“面面高产，头头快速”的行动口号，在全矿开展了大面积丰产和快速掘进的竞赛运动。
    这个煤矿在加强生产领导的同时，从各方面加强对掘进工作的领导。从局到矿直到各个井口，领导干部都对生产、掘进作了分工负责，在发动群众鸣放的基础上，一手订出大面积丰产规划，一手订出掘进工作规划，重点的掘进迎头都纳入了调度计划，以便把现场情况及时反映上来，及时分析掘进中的问题。局领导还明确规定，掘进队只能加强不能削弱。
    为了有效地提高产量，充分发挥生产准备工作的最大效能，各矿都坚持执行了正规循环作业，在不同的工作面里推广了双循环、多循环经验。
    新汶煤矿在今年生产任务比较繁重的情况下，把生产和掘进对立起来，产生了“重采轻掘”的片面思想。因此，虽然去年第四季度掘进和生产不相适应的矛盾已经严重暴露出来，有的矿剩下的获得煤量还不到一个月，但是今年掘进工作仍未引起足够的重视，而是一味追求产量。3月份这个局召开两次大会，都是要产量。有的矿和采区为了搞高产，组织报喜，便“吃肥丢瘦”，乱采乱掘，还有的矿把掘进改调到采煤掌子去采煤，使采、掘衔接越趋紧张。矿务局领导上每天摇几次电话，有时亲自下到矿井搞高产。新汶矿务局孙村煤矿的快速掘进经验曾被煤炭部总结在全国三十六项经验之内，但是它在新汶矿务局没得到推广。这样一来，全局3月份的煤炭产量虽然跃到三十一万吨（比2月份提高40％），掘进工作却远远掉在后面，到4月份有的矿一个准备工作面也没有，有的矿的获得煤量只够几天开采，这就迫使全局从4月份开始煤炭产量直线下降。现在，新汶矿务局正集中力量加强掘进工作，力争在比较短的时间内扭转被动局面。
    山东煤炭管理局正在通过总结这两个煤矿的经验教训，教育各矿干部树立全面思想，争取在10月以前达到采掘平衡，保证煤炭生产稳步上升。（谭冰洁）
