Xinhua News Agency, Moscow Dispatch: At the Soviet Writers' Congress, starting with the afternoon session on the 18th, the representatives began discussing Surkov's report.

At the afternoon session on the 18th, five writers' representatives spoke. Panferov, in his speech, pointed out the educational role of Soviet literature in helping people solve major life problems and realize the most beautiful goal—building a communist society. He said that in the struggle between the new and the old, the advanced and the backward, writers should always pave the way for new things. Soviet writers will surely gloriously complete the tasks set by the Party.

Writer Mikhalkov, in his speech, particularly talked about the issue of developing children's literature. He said that writers who write for children are responsible for the world's tomorrow. Currently, the Soviet Union publishes more than 170 million books for children every year, and these works are printed in fifty-eight national literatures. He also proposed that children's writers should write more works for the future builders of communism.

At the meeting on the 19th, more than ten writers' representatives spoke. The representatives also listened to the report of the chairman of the credentials committee and elected members of the committee to revise the writers' association charter.

Writer Zelinsky said that the influence of Soviet literature in the literatures of various countries in the world is increasingly strengthening in recent years. He said that currently, an average of two or three Soviet novels are published in various countries around the world every day. In 1958, Soviet novels were translated into forty-eight languages in fifty countries. The circulation of Soviet novels also accounts for a large proportion in those countries. These facts fully demonstrate that the fallacious claims of some revisionists that the prestige of Soviet novels has declined are groundless.

Chukovsky, a children's literature writer and translator who is seventy-seven years old, exposed the essence of reactionary literature in capitalist countries in his speech. He said that at present, countries such as the United States and Britain are full of literature that promotes murder and hatred of mankind, which proves the decline of bourgeois civilization. And Soviet literature is marching forward along the glorious road.

Abashidze, a Georgian writer, Yashen, an Uzbek writer, and Luks, a Latvian writer, also spoke at the morning session on the 19th. In their speeches, they talked about the recent writers' congresses held in various union republics to summarize the development of Soviet national literatures in recent years. Yashen also specifically mentioned that many Uzbek writers requested to go to factories and rural areas for a long time to write about the heroic figures of communist construction.

At the afternoon session on the 19th, Guseyn, chairman of the Azerbaijan Writers' Association, said in his speech that Soviet writers are confidently realizing the tasks put forward by the 21st Congress of the CPSU. The vigorous development of Soviet multi-ethnic literature completely shattered the fallacies of the bourgeoisie about the inability of national literature to develop.

Writer Polevoi severely criticized Yugoslav revisionist literature in his speech. He said that Yugoslavia had very good literary works in the past. However, many works in recent years have embodied formalism and the position of flattering imperialism, and works full of pessimism have continued to appear.

Representatives from Poland, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, France, and Japan delivered congratulatory messages at the meeting.

According to the report of the credentials committee, a total of 497 representatives from 49 different nationalities of the Soviet Union attended this conference. At present, the Soviet Writers' Association has a total of 4,801 members, an increase of 1,200 from 1954.

    苏联文学循着光辉道路奋勇迈进
    苏联作家代表畅述文学事业壮丽景象
    本报综合报道　据新华社莫斯科电：苏联作家代表大会从18日下午会议起，代表们开始讨论苏尔科夫的报告。
    在18日下午会议上有五位作家代表发言。潘费罗夫在发言中指出了苏联文学在帮助人们解决重大生活问题和实现最美好的目的——建设共产主义社会过程中的教育作用。他说，作家在新与旧、先进与落后的斗争中，应该永远为新事物开辟道路。苏联作家一定能光荣地完成党所提出的任务。
  作家米哈尔科夫在发言中特别谈到关于发展儿童文学的问题。他说，为儿童们写作的作家对世界的明天负有责任。苏联现在每年为孩子们出版的书籍达一亿七千万册以上，这些作品共用五十八种民族文学印行。他还提出，儿童作家应该给未来的共产主义建设者多写作品。
    在19日的大会上，有十多位作家代表发了言。代表们还听取了资格审查委员会主席的报告，选举了修改作家协会章程的委员会人员。
    作家泽林斯基说，苏联文学近年来在世界各国文学中起的影响正日益加强。他说，目前，在世界各国每天平均都有两、三本苏联小说出版。1958年，苏联小说被五十个国家译成四十八种文字。苏联小说的发行数量也在那些国内占着很大比重。这些事实充分说明了某些修正主义者诬蔑苏联小说威望下降的谬论是毫无根据的。
    七十七岁高龄的儿童文学家和翻译家楚科夫斯基在发言中揭露了资本主义国家中的反动文学的本质。他说，目前，在美、英等资本主义国家中，充满了鼓吹凶杀和仇恨人类的文学，这证明资产阶级文明的没落。而苏联文学则循着光辉的道路在奋勇迈进。
    在19日上午会议上发言的还有格鲁吉亚作家阿巴希泽、乌兹别克作家亚申、拉脱维亚作家卢克斯等，他们在发言中，谈到了不久前各加盟共和国召开作家代表大会总结近年来苏联各民族文学发展的情况。亚申还特别谈到了乌兹别克许多作家要求长期下厂下乡，写作共产主义建设的英雄人物的情况。
    在19日下午的会议上，阿塞拜疆作家协会主席古谢恩在发言中说，苏联作家正在满怀信心地实现苏共二十一大提出的任务。苏联多民族文学的蓬勃发展完全粉碎了资产阶级关于民族文学不能发展的谬论。
    作家波列伏依在发言中严厉批判了南斯拉夫的修正主义文学。他说，南斯拉夫有过很好的文学作品。但是近年来的许多作品都体现了形式主义和为帝国主义拍马屁的立场，充满悲观主义的作品不断出现。
    波兰、朝鲜民主主义人民共和国、法国和日本的代表团人员在会上致了贺词。
    根据资格审查委员会的报告，出席这次大会的代表一共有四百九十七人，他们来自苏联的四十九个不同的民族。目前，苏联作家协会一共有会员四千八百零一人，比1954年增加了一千二百人。
