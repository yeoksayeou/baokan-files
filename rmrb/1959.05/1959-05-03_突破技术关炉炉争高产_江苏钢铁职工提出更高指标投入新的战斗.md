Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, May 2nd. Steel workers in Jiangsu Province have thrown themselves into a new production battle with even greater enthusiasm at the beginning of Red May. They solemnly declared: "Fight hard in Red May, break through technical barriers, produce good steel, every furnace strives for high yield, and guarantee the completion of steelmaking and rolling tasks with quality and quantity, making contributions to the 18 million tons of steel!"

Due to the leadership of the Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the efforts of all steelworkers, the province's pig iron production task plan for April was completed ahead of schedule on April 27, with a total production of 42,375 tons; the pig iron export plan for April was also completed ahead of schedule on the same day. This victory has further encouraged the revolutionary enthusiasm of the workers. The workers are determined to make persistent efforts in May to fully conquer the steelmaking fortress, so that steel and iron production can triumph together. Workers in the steelmaking workshop of the Nanjing Puzhen Rolling Stock Factory had created excellent achievements of long furnace life, high output, and good quality in April. On the eve of May Day, they ambitiously put forward the slogan "Learn from Shanghai Steel, compare with Shanghai Steel, catch up with Shanghai Steel" (referring to the Shanghai Steel Plant), to achieve higher targets in Red May: the average furnace life of the converter should be 30 heats, striving for 35 heats, with the highest exceeding 40 heats; the qualified rate of steel ingots should reach over 90%; the desulfurization rate of the converter should reach 60%, striving for 70%; and the cost should be reduced by 30% compared to the first quarter. The workers of the Nanjing Aeronautical Institute Steel Plant also set ambitious goals. This plant, with small furnaces and poor equipment conditions, used a 0.5-ton basic small converter to turn high-sulfur earthy iron into steel that meets national standards and cast qualified steel castings. Now, the workers of this plant are full of confidence and propose: In the battle of Red May, they will also use this 0.5-ton small converter to create even greater achievements.

The Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China held a provincial steel production broadcast conference on April 28. Xu Jiatun, Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee Secretariat, asked all steelworkers in the province to boost their energy, concentrate their efforts, clarify their goals, and fight a beautiful battle for steel production in Red May.

    突破技术关炉炉争高产
    江苏钢铁职工提出更高指标投入新的战斗
    新华社南京2日电　江苏省钢铁战线上的职工们，在红五月开始的时候又以更大的干劲投入了新的生产战斗。他们庄严地宣誓：“大战红五月，突破技术关，炼出好钢水，炉炉争高产，保证按质按量完成炼钢轧钢任务，为一八○○万吨钢立功！”
    由于中共江苏省委的领导与全体钢铁工人的努力，全省4月份的生铁生产任务计划已在4月27日提前完成，共产生铁四万二千三百七十五吨；4月份的生铁外调计划也在同一天提前完成。这个胜利，更加鼓舞了工人们的革命干劲。工人们决心在5月份再接再厉，全力攻下炼钢堡垒，使钢和铁的生产同奏凯歌。南京浦镇车辆工厂炼钢车间的工人，曾在4月份创造炉龄长、产量高、质量好的优良成绩。“五一”前夕，他们又雄心勃勃地提出“学上钢、比上钢、赶上钢”（指上海钢铁厂）的口号，在红五月中实现更高的指标：转炉的平均炉龄为三十炉，争取三十五炉，最高的要突破四十炉；钢锭合格率达到90％以上；转炉去硫率达到60％，争取70％；成本要求比第一季度降低30％。南京航空学院炼钢厂的工人们，也立下了雄心大志。这个厂在炉子小、设备条件差的情况下。用零点五的碱性小转炉，把高硫土铁炼成了合乎国家规定标准的钢，浇铸出了合格的铸钢件。现在，这个厂的工人们又满怀信心地提出：在大战红五月中，还要用这个零点五吨的小转炉创造出更大的成绩。
    中共江苏省委在4月28日召开了全省钢铁生产广播大会，省委书记处书记许家屯同志要求全省钢铁职工鼓足干劲，集中力量，明确目标，在红五月打一个钢铁生产的漂亮仗。
