Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 25th: Our reporter Ge Lai reports: Many serfs in the Gyantse area are angrily denouncing the bandit leader and reactionary great serf owner, Palla·Tuden Weideng, for his cruel exploitation and persecution of them. The serfs unanimously demand early democratic reform to destroy the man-eating serf system.

　　The Palla·Tuden Weideng family is known among the great serf owners in Tibet for its cruelty. In addition to huge family properties in Lhasa, the Palla family has 31 Xika (manors) and 12 Zhuoba (pastures) on both sides of the Nyang Chu River, owning more than 3,000 serfs and domestic slaves, occupying more than 3,500 mu of land, and possessing more than 7,000 cattle and sheep. Palla·Tuden Weideng's younger brother, Palla·Wangqiu (also a rebel), lived in Gyantse for a long time to supervise the serfs. Palla·Wangqiu and his wife lived in a manor with 60 regular domestic slaves and 40 reserve domestic slaves. The Palla family also had prisons, equipped with shackles, handcuffs, and various inhumane torture instruments for digging eyes, cutting noses, and nailing palms to persecute serfs. During the rule of the original Tibetan local government, the serfs constantly revolted because they could not bear the cruel oppression of the Palla family, and many serfs were forced to flee to other places.

　　Many serfs burst into tears when they talked about the Palla family's cruel exploitation and persecution of them. They accused that Palla's granaries were piled up with grain, some of which had rotted, and even Palla's dog could eat four or five catties of zanba and butter tea every day, while the serfs only had half a catty of zanba a day and drank thin gruel. Many serf families could not even eat half a bowl of zanba a day. The serfs wore patched and mended ragged clothes that could not cover their bodies, and even the entire property of five serfs was not worth a valuable boot of Palla's. Daojie, who has been a domestic slave for the Palla family for three generations, burst into tears when he accused his family of the cruel persecution they had suffered. He said: His grandfather was a domestic slave for the Palla family. Because he could not get enough to eat at home, he borrowed 30 Ke of highland barley from the Palla family, and the interest rate was six Ke for every five Ke borrowed. Later, the interest became more and more, and he could not pay it off at all. His grandfather was forced to death by Palla's debt; his father also worked as a domestic slave for Palla and was also exhausted to death. Daojie, from the age of nine, replaced his father to continue working as a domestic slave, suffering for forty-four years. He could only eat a little zanba flour porridge every day, and only sixteen Ke of miscellaneous grains for feeding livestock to support his family every year. His eight children were all sallow and emaciated because they could not get enough to eat. In desperation, he had to borrow a little usury from the Palla family to survive. Now, counting from the thirty Ke of highland barley borrowed during his grandfather's time, he owes the Palla family more than 110,500 Ke of grain. Daojie was driven out of the house by the Palla family after he was old and weak. Daojie finally said: Now, the rebellion launched by Palla and other reactionary great serf owners has completely failed, the storm clouds have passed, and the days for the serfs to stand up have arrived. He hopes to implement democratic reforms and live a new happy life under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao.

　　Garmaba Zhong, who has been a slave for Palla for more than 20 years since he was 11 years old, accused that after the peaceful liberation of Tibet, we all longed for reform, but Palla not only opposed it, but also strictly forbade the serfs from saying the word "reform." Once, a serf named Angang was captured by Palla·Wangqiu to be a slave. Angang escaped in the dark and mentioned reform to others. Palla·Wangqiu searched for him everywhere. When he could not catch him, he imprisoned his brother, and finally beat his brother to death. Angang couldn't bear it any longer and went to Lhasa to file a complaint with the original Tibetan local government. The reactionary original Tibetan local government handed this matter over to Palla·Tuden Weideng for handling. Tuden Weideng escorted Angang back to the manor, and Palla·Wangqiu put Angang in prison, lit kerosene lamps and whipped him with leather whips every night, beating Angang to death again. Garmaba Zhong said that in 1956, because he could not bear the devastation of the Palla family, he had no food or clothing, so he escaped in the middle of the night. Palla·Wangqiu ransacked his entire family and later caught him back and beat him with more than 300 leather whips. Garmaba Zhong said: Now, the era when these reactionary guys rode on the people's heads and acted like overlords is over forever. We resolutely demand the implementation of democratic reforms to meet the demands of our working people.

　　Jiang Bai, a lama from Gyantse Baiju Temple, angrily accused Palla of killing his father. He said: "My sixty-four-year-old father was imprisoned by them because he was too old to travel for Palla and could not repay Palla's usury. They put shackles on my father and put him in prison, only giving him a little horse feed to eat. My father was tortured to death by Palla very quickly.” He also revealed that Palla often provoked the close unity of the Han and Tibetan nationalities, insulted the great Chinese Communist Party, and said that after the Communist Party came, there was no freedom for the common people, and that lamas would be eliminated, etc. Jiang Bai said that the opposite is true. It is not the Communist Party but a small group of inhuman bandits and reactionary great serf owners who do not allow the common people to live and arrest lamas to be slaves. He said: "I sincerely request the implementation of democratic reforms to resolutely eliminate the unreasonable and man-eating system."

　　Dunzhu, a herdsman who has been herding sheep for Palla for more than 20 years, accused: "Palla forced me to leave my wife and children to herd sheep for him, and stipulated that three ewes should give birth to two lambs every year and pay forty catties of butter. However, the sheep could not eat grass and died in large numbers due to the plague. Palla whipped me all over my body until I was bleeding and festering, and he still wanted me to compensate him for the sheep and butter. Now I owe Palla sheep and butter that I can't calculate. Without the Communist Party and without today, I would not be able to pay off his sheep and butter even after a hundred years, and my whole family's skin would be peeled off layer by layer by him." He said bitterly that Palla is not a human being, but a "demon king" who eats human flesh and drinks human blood.

　　The serfs accused that Palla, in order to be hostile to the Gyantse Sub-Committee of the CPC and afraid that his usury would be affected, ordered the serfs not to accept agricultural loans issued by the Gyantse Sub-Committee of the CPC, otherwise they would be punished as "surrendering to the Han people." Palla also put Tibetans who were close to the People's Liberation Army and Han workers on a blacklist, threatening them by saying, "If anyone supports the Communist Party, the gods will be angry." The serfs also revealed that the Palla family had intricate connections with imperialists, foreign reactionaries, and the Kuomintang bandit gang. After liberation, Palla's manor had always displayed a photo of Palla·Wangqiu and the traitor Chiang Kai-shek taken together, and the "national emblem" pattern of the Kuomintang reactionaries was also pasted in the toilet.

    江孜农民控诉大农奴主叛匪帕拉
    一致要求早日进行民主改革摧毁吃人的农奴制度
    新华社拉萨25日电  本社记者格来报道：江孜地区的许多农奴，愤怒地控诉叛匪头子、反动大农奴主帕拉·土登为登对他们的残酷剥削和迫害。农奴们一致要求早日进行民主改革，摧毁吃人的农奴制度。
    帕拉·土登为登一家在西藏的大农奴主中以残酷闻名。帕拉家族除在拉萨有巨额家产外，在年楚河两岸有三十一个溪卡（庄园）和十二个卓巴（牧场），拥有农奴、家奴共三千多人，占有土地三千五百多亩，牛羊七千多头。帕拉·土登为登的弟弟帕拉·汪秋（也是叛乱分子）长期住在江孜负责监督农奴。帕拉·汪秋和他的妻子两个人住的一个庄园，常备的家奴就有六十人，预备家奴有四十人。帕拉家还设有监狱，备有脚镣、手铐和挖眼睛、割鼻子、钉手掌用的各种惨无人道的刑具来迫害农奴。在原西藏地方政府统治时期，农奴们就因为不堪帕拉家族的惨酷压迫而不断起来反抗过，有不少农奴被迫逃亡他乡。
    许多农奴一讲起帕拉一家对他们的残酷剥削和迫害，就伤心地哭了起来。他们控诉说，帕拉的粮仓里粮食堆积如山，有的已经腐烂，甚至帕拉的一条狗每天都能吃到四五斤糌粑和酥油茶，而农奴们一个人一天只有半斤糌粑，喝的是稀糊糊，许多农奴家里一天连半碗糌粑也吃不到。农奴们穿的是补了又补、缀了又缀已经褴褛得不能蔽体的破衣服，甚至五个农奴的全部家产，还抵不上帕拉的一只值钱的靴子。祖孙三代都为帕拉家当家奴的刀杰控诉他家受到的残酷迫害时眼泪夺眶而出。他说：他的祖父为帕拉家当家奴，因为家里吃不饱，借了帕拉家的三十克青稞，利息是借五克还六克，后来利息越滚越多，根本还不清，他的祖父就这样被帕拉的债务逼死了；他的父亲又给帕拉作家奴，也活活地累死了。刀杰从九岁起，又代替他父亲继续作家奴，整整苦了四十四年，每天只能吃到一点糌粑面做的稀糊糊，每年只有十六克喂牲口的杂粮养家，他的八个孩子因为吃不饱，个个面黄饥瘦。实在无法，又不得不向帕拉家借一点高利贷活命，现在从祖父时借的三十克青稞算起，他已欠帕拉家十一万零五百多克粮食。刀杰年老力衰后，又被帕拉家赶了出来。刀杰最后说：现在，帕拉和其他反动大农奴主发动的叛乱彻底失败了，狂风乌云过去了，农奴出头的日子到了。他希望实行民主改革，在共产党、毛主席领导下过新的幸福生活。
    从十一岁起，就给帕拉当了二十多年奴隶的噶玛巴仲控诉说，西藏和平解放后我们都渴望改革，但帕拉不仅反对，而且严禁农奴们说“改革”两字。有一次一个叫昂刚的农奴被帕拉·汪秋捉去当奴隶，昂刚在黑夜里逃跑了，并向其他人提了改革的事，帕拉·汪秋就到处捉拿他，捉不到就把他的哥哥关在监狱里，最后把他哥哥活活打死。昂刚忍无可忍，跑到拉萨去向原西藏地方政府告状。反动的原西藏地方政府竟把这件事交给帕拉·土登为登处理，土登为登就把昂刚押回庄园，帕拉·汪秋便把昂刚关进监狱，每天晚上点着汽油灯用皮鞭打，把昂刚又活活打死了。噶玛巴仲说，1956年他因受不了帕拉家的摧残，无吃无穿，乘深夜逃了出去，帕拉·汪秋就抄了他的全家，以后又把他捉回去打了三百多皮鞭。噶玛巴仲说：现在，这些反动家伙们骑在人民头上作威作福的时代永远结束了，我们坚决要求实行民主改革，满足我们劳苦人民的要求。
    江孜白居寺喇嘛姜白愤怒地控诉了帕拉害死他父亲的罪行。他说：“我六十四岁的父亲因为年纪大了，不能给帕拉出差，同时还不起帕拉的高利贷，他们就把我父亲扣上镣铐押进监狱，每天只给一点马料吃，我父亲就这样被帕拉很快折磨死了。”他又揭露说，帕拉经常挑拨汉藏民族的亲密团结，侮辱伟大的中国共产党，说什么共产党来了没有老百姓的自由、要消灭喇嘛等等。姜白说，事实恰恰相反，不让老百姓活下去、把喇嘛捉去当奴隶的，不是共产党而是一小撮没有人性的叛匪和反动的大农奴主。他说：“我衷心要求实行民主改革，把不合理的吃人制度坚决铲除。”
  给帕拉放了二十多年羊的牧奴顿珠控诉说：“帕拉强迫我抛下妻子儿女去给他放牧，并规定三个母羊每年要生两个小羊，缴四十斤酥油。可是羊吃不上草，得瘟疫大批死亡，帕拉便用皮鞭打得我全身冒血淌脓，还要我给他赔羊和酥油。现在我欠下帕拉的羊和酥油已没法计算了，如果没有共产党、没有今天，我再过一百年也还不清他的羊和酥油，全家人的皮都要被他一层层剥掉的。”他痛恨地说，帕拉不是人，而是吃人肉喝人血的“魔王”。
    农奴们控诉说，帕拉为了与中共江孜分工委为敌，而且害怕自己的高利贷受到影响，曾下令农奴不准接受中共江孜分工委发放的农贷，否则就以“投降汉人”论罪。帕拉还把和解放军以及汉族工作人员接近的藏民列入黑名单，威胁他们说：“谁拥护共产党，神灵会发怒的”。农奴们还揭露帕拉一家和帝国主义、外国反动派以及国民党匪帮有着千丝万缕的联系，帕拉庄园里解放后一直放着帕拉·汪秋和蒋介石卖国贼合拍的照片，在厕所里还贴着国民党反动派“国徽”的图案。
