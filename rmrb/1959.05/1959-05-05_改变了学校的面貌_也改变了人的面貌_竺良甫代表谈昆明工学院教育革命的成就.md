    Changed the face of the school
    Also changed the face of the people
    Delegate Zhu Liangfu talks about the achievements of the educational revolution at Kunming Institute of Technology

Chairman, fellow delegates:

I fully agree with and wholeheartedly support Premier Zhou Enlai's government work report, as well as the reports by Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen.

1958 was a year of comprehensive Great Leap Forward in our country. Under the brilliant illumination of the Party's general line for socialist construction, a Great Leap Forward also emerged on the cultural and educational front alongside the Great Leap Forward on the economic front, achieving extraordinarily brilliant accomplishments. In all aspects of cultural and educational undertakings, the Party's leadership has been strengthened; the educational policy of serving the politics of the working class and combining education with productive labor has been established. This has enabled our universities, middle schools, and primary schools to appear in various regions with a completely new look and to increasingly develop into new types of schools for cultivating communist new people.

Last year, Kunming Institute of Technology, like schools across the country, launched a mass movement of diligence and thrift in running schools, beginning to combine school education with productive labor, breaking the old tradition of belittling physical labor and changing the atmosphere of the school. On the basis of the victory of diligence and thrift in running schools, it further carried out a mass movement of educational reform, adopting the method of "big contending, big blooming, big debate, and big character posters" to debate the training objectives, education plans, and teaching syllabi. Teachers and students all conducted inspections and exposures targeting the serious separation from politics, separation from production, and separation of theory from practice that existed in past teaching. They jointly or separately proposed different education plans for comparison and debate. Then, the leadership, based on the Party's education policy, analyzed and studied the opinions of the masses and formulated a trial implementation plan for the education plan. At this time, productive labor was officially stipulated in the education plan. These two movements were both carried out under the leadership of the Party committee. Through these two movements, the vigorous vitality of education serving the politics of the working class and the combination of education with productive labor fundamentally changed the entire face of the school.

At the beginning of diligence and thrift in running schools, in order to make the productive labor of each major as closely integrated with the major as possible, the first problem to be solved was the issue of a productive labor base. At that time, our institute had five majors: geology, mining, mineral processing, metallurgy, and machinery. Except for the machinery major, which had a relatively large machinery factory and a relatively close connection with Kunming Machine Tool Plant, there was an urgent need to solve the problems of the other four majors. The school Party committee immediately contacted relevant geological departments and spent three months conducting a general survey and mineral exploration in more than a dozen counties and 16,000 square kilometers of land in Yunnan Province, discovering 35 kinds of mineral deposits in the process. At the same time, the school Party committee also consulted with the Chuxiong Prefectural Committee of Yunnan Province and concluded a twenty-year cooperation contract with the Yao'an Lead Mine in the area. This was an important measure taken by our institute in combining education with productive labor, which also solved the problem of a productive labor base for the mining, mineral processing, and metallurgy majors. It also assisted the mine in solving design and construction problems in production, as well as ongoing technical problems, supporting local industry. Such a comprehensive collaboration was warmly supported by the vast number of teachers and students and Yao'an Lead Mine, and both sides jointly proposed the intimate slogan: "The school's mine, the mine's school."

What are the benefits of conducting teaching at the mine? Based on our experience over the past year, we have analyzed the courses of each major. For example, for the course on mining methods, because there are many types of ore deposits in the mine, there are also many mining methods. Currently, the methods used include comprehensive open-stope mining, sublevel stoping, room-and-pillar mining, and cut-and-fill mining. In the future, caving methods and other methods will be tested, so that they can be more comprehensively combined with teaching. It can also be combined with production problems to arrange course design and scientific and technological research activities. In general, there are several benefits to conducting teaching at the mine:

      (1) Teaching can better connect with actual production, consolidate and deepen theoretical knowledge, and can expand the scope of knowledge and horizons.
      (2) The mine is newly built, and there are many tasks and problems in design, construction, improving processes, improving equipment, improving operating methods, and systems. Participating in these tasks can indeed cultivate the ability to solve practical production problems and master practical production knowledge. At the same time, it is also easy to find scientific and technological topics for scientific research.
    (3) Using the conditions of the mine can very well explore the experience of new teaching methods and methods of on-site teaching, on-site investigation, and inviting production experts or veteran workers to teach together with teachers.
    (4) In the mine environment, teachers and students can often come into contact with workers and come into contact with production practice, which is conducive to cultivating the thoughts and feelings of the working class, carrying out ideological transformation, and improving socialist and communist awareness.
Conducting teaching at the mine has the above-mentioned favorable conditions, but there are still problems, that is, the combination of teaching and productive labor cannot fully meet the requirements of each course. This needs to be studied and resolved.

The practice of production over the past year has also powerfully promoted scientific research work. In the past, we also knew that colleges and universities should engage in scientific research, but we could not find scientific research topics and could not write scientific research reports. Students thought that scientific research was a matter for teachers, young teachers thought it was a matter for older teachers, and older teachers rarely could write decent reports. But when the school ran its own factories and engaged in production, this stalemate was broken. In the past year, our institute completed more than 200 scientific research projects, of which more than 120 were relatively outstanding, more than six times the total number of scientific research projects since the establishment of our institute. Why couldn't we find scientific research topics in the past, but now we can? Why couldn't we do scientific research in the past, but now we can? The reason is none other than that young teachers and students have emancipated their minds and broken superstitions; because scientific research comes from production and serves production; because theory is connected with practice, theory can solve practical problems in production. Engaging in production has broken the stalemate in scientific research, and now the problem is how to arrange it. The school should focus on teaching and appropriately arrange the work of teaching, production, and scientific research. This is a very complicated and very detailed work. Teaching, production, and scientific research, these three plays all need to be performed on one stage in the school, and they must all be performed vividly. How exactly this play is performed, there is not much experience, and it needs to be further studied and resolved.

What is worth mentioning is that through productive labor, the ideological outlook of the vast number of teachers and students has undergone profound changes, from belittling labor to loving labor, and from belittling workers to respecting workers. After productive labor was formally included in the education plan, students of each major carried out productive labor according to the prescribed time. Teachers of each teaching and research group and staff of each administrative department also have their own production bases and labor places. In addition, if there is public welfare labor, as long as the Party committee issues a call, the entire institute will immediately take action and will definitely overfulfill the task. After hard work, no one has been heard to complain, and when students talk about their feelings, they sing songs saying: "The Communist Party is our sun, nurturing us to grow up healthily; we are like stars and the moon, surrounding the sun day and night." This is indeed a very gratifying phenomenon.

Productive labor has changed the labor viewpoint, and it has also changed the teaching ideas of teachers. Before engaging in productive labor, many teachers only had book knowledge in their minds. When they frowned, they would not think of anything else, only of books. Naturally, their teaching idea was: theory - theory - theory, it was impossible to change to: practice - theory - re-practice. But when the school engaged in productive labor, they saw students operating machines and became the masters of the machines, while they themselves could not do it. Therefore, in the past there were people who "read ten thousand books and could write like a god," but in this situation, when they wanted to teach, they "knew their difficulties after teaching." Therefore, many teachers went to factories and mines to participate in productive labor, put down their airs and humbly learned from workers and young students. We are not against book knowledge. Book knowledge is the theory written by predecessors summarizing the experience of production struggles and class struggles. People cannot directly experience everything. In fact, most of the knowledge is the indirect experience of others. It is entirely necessary to critically accept indirect experience, but valuing indirect experience and not valuing direct experience means that knowledge is incomplete. Teachers going to factories and mines makes their knowledge tend to be more complete, and this kind of transformation is naturally a good transformation. On the student side, book knowledge is relatively lacking, and it must also develop towards its lacking aspects. "Learning then knows inadequacy, teaching then knows difficulty" is the condition for "teaching and learning promote each other" and also the driving force for further improving teaching quality. "Young intellectuals should humbly learn from learned seniors, and older intellectuals should also learn from the strengths of young intellectuals." Premier Zhou's statement further encouraged the enthusiasm of the vast number of teachers and students. Therefore, what lies before the teachers is how to strengthen self-transformation, how to improve professional knowledge (including book knowledge and practical knowledge), and how to become one with the students, and under the leadership of the Party, under the principle of teaching and learning promote each other, truly play a leading role in the teaching process. This is an important issue at present.

In summary, the result of implementing the Party's education policy over the past year is that the students' socialist and communist awareness has been improved, the knowledge they have acquired is also relatively rich and complete, their physical fitness has also been enhanced, the quality of teaching has been improved, scientific research work has been launched, and the class viewpoint, labor viewpoint, collective viewpoint, and dialectical materialism viewpoint of the vast number of teachers and students have all been tempered and improved. This is a great victory of the Party's education policy, a great victory of Marxist-Leninist educational thought, and a great victory of the vast number of teachers and students exerting great efforts and striving for the top under the leadership of the Party. Of course, the time for implementing the policy is not very long, there is not much experience, and there are still many problems, but as long as we exert even greater efforts under the leadership of the Party, meticulously and persistently, all difficulties and problems can be overcome and solved. Let the vast number of teachers and students unite and work hard to further implement the Party's education policy, deepen the educational revolution, and continue to improve the quality of teaching!

### 改变了学校的面貌  也改变了人的面貌  竺良甫代表谈昆明工学院教育革命的成就

    改变了学校的面貌
    也改变了人的面貌
    竺良甫代表谈昆明工学院教育革命的成就主席、各位代表：
    我完全同意并衷心拥护周恩来总理的政府工作报告和李富春副总理、李先念副总理、彭真副委员长的报告。
    一九五八年是我国全面大跃进的一年。在党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，与经济战线上大跃进的同时，文化教育战线上也出现大跃进的局面，获得了异常灿烂的成就。在文化教育事业各个方面，党的领导加强了；教育为工人阶级的政治服务，教育和生产劳动相结合的教育方针确立了。这就使我国的大学、中学和小学都以崭新的面貌出现于各个地区，而且日益发展成为培养共产主义新人的新型学校。
    去年昆明工学院和全国学校一样开展了勤工俭学的群众运动，开始把学校教育同生产劳动结合起来，打破了轻视体力劳动的旧传统，改变了学校的风气。并在勤工俭学胜利基础上进一步开展教育改革的群众运动，采取“四大”的方式辩论了培养目标、教育计划和教学大纲。教师和学生都针对着过去教学中存在的严重脱离政治、脱离生产和理论脱离实际的方面进行了检查和揭发，共同或分别提出不同的教育计划进行比较和辩论，然后领导上根据党的教育方针，分析研究群众的意见，制订出教育计划试行方案。在这时候生产劳动才正式地在教育计划中规定下来。这两次运动都是在党委领导下进行的，经过这两次运动，教育为工人阶级的政治服务，教育和生产劳动相结合的旺盛活力从根本上改变了学校的全部面貌。
    勤工俭学的开始，为了使各专业的生产劳动尽可能地与本专业结合，那首先要解决的问题是生产劳动基地问题。当时我院有地质、采矿、选矿、冶金和机械五个专业，除机械专业有比较大的机械厂并与昆明机床厂有比较密切的联系外，急需解决其他四个专业的问题。学校党委即与地质有关部门联系得以三个月的时间在云南省十几个县，一万六千平方公里的土地进行了普查与找矿的生产劳动，并在劳动过程中发现了各种矿藏三十五种。与此同时，学校党委又与云南省楚雄地委协商得与该区的姚安铅矿订立了为期二十年的合作合同。这是我院在教育与生产劳动相结合方面所采取的重要措施，也就为采、选、冶三个专业解决了生产劳动基地的问题。同时也协助矿山解决生产中的设计和施工以及经常性的技术问题，支援了地方工业。像这样一个全面协作得到了广大师生和姚安铅矿热烈的拥护，双方共同提出亲切的口号：“学校的矿山，矿山的学校。”
    在矿山进行教学究竟有什么好处？我们根据一年来的经验，对于每一专业的课程都作了分析。例如对采矿方法一课来讲，由于矿山的矿床类型很多，因此采矿方法亦很多。目前用的有全面空场法，中段空场法、房柱法、留矿法，今后还要试用崩落法和其他方法，这样可以比较全面地与教学相结合。又可结合生产问题，安排课程设计及科学技术研究活动。总起来说在矿山进行教学有几点好处：
      （1）教学能更好的联系生产实际，巩固和加深理论知识，并可扩大知识领域及眼界。
      （2）矿山是新建的，在设计、施工、改进流程、改良设备、改进操作方法、制度等方面的工作及问题很多。参与这些工作，确可培养解决生产实际问题的能力，掌握生产实际知识。同时也容易找到科学技术课题进行科学研究。
    （3）利用矿山条件很可以摸索新的教学方法的经验和现场教学、现场考查、请生产能手或老工人与教师共同讲课的方法。
    （4）在矿山环境内，师生能经常与工人接触，并接触生产实际，有利于培养工人阶级思想感情，进行思想改造，提高社会主义、共产主义觉悟。在矿山进行教学有上述的有利条件，但还存在着问题，即在教学和生产劳动结合方面还不能完全满足每门课程的要求，这是需要研究加以解决的。
    一年来的生产实践还有力地推动了科学研究工作。过去也知道高等学校要搞科学研究，但就是找不到科学研究课题，写不出科学研究的报告。学生认为科学研究是教师的事情，年青教师认为是年老教师的事情，而年老教师也很少能够写出像样的报告来。但学校自办工厂，一搞生产，这种僵局就打开了。在去年一年我院完成了科学研究课题达二百多项，其中比较出色的就有一百二十多项，为我院成立以来科学研究项目总和六倍以上。为什么过去找不到科学研究课题而现在找到了呢？为什么过去做不出科学研究而现在可以做出了呢？原因不是别的，由于青年教师和学生解放了思想，破除了迷信；由于科学研究来自生产，为生产服务；由于理论联系了实际，理论就能解决生产中的实际问题。搞了生产，科学研究的僵局是打开了，现在的问题是如何安排的问题。学校应以教学为主恰如其分地安排教学、生产和科学研究的工作，这是一个非常复杂，非常细致的工作。教学、生产和科学研究，这三出戏均需要在学校一个舞台上演出而且都要演得有声有色，这台戏究竟怎样演法，经验还不很多，是需要进一步研究加以解决的。
    值得提出的，通过生产劳动，广大师生的思想面貌起了深刻的变化，由轻视劳动变为热爱劳动，由轻视劳动者变为尊重劳动者。生产劳动正式列入教育计划后，各专业的学生均按规定时间进行生产劳动。各教研组的教师和各行政部门的职工也都有自己的生产基地和劳动场所。除此以外如有公益劳动，只要党委一号召全院无不立即行动起来，而且一定超额完成任务。辛勤劳动之后亦未听见谁有怨言，而学生们谈感想时作歌说：“共产党是我们的太阳，培养我们健康地成长；我们像星星和月亮，日日夜夜围绕着太阳。”这确是非常可喜的现象。
    生产劳动改变了劳动观点，同时也改变了教师们的教学思想。在未搞生产劳动以前，很多教师脑子里只有书本知识，眉头一皱，不会想到别的，只会想到书本。很自然，其教学思想是：理论——理论——理论，不可能变为：实践——理论——再实践。但学校一搞生产劳动，眼看到学生操作机器，做了机器的主人，而自己反而不能动手。所以过去有“读破万卷书，下笔如有神”的人，在这种形势之下再要教书，“教然后知困”了。所以很多教师就下厂、下矿去参加生产劳动，放下架子虚心向工人和青年学生学习。我们不是反对书本知识，书本知识是前人总结生产斗争和阶级斗争的经验写成的理论，人不能事事直接经验，事实上多数的知识都是别人的间接经验，批判地接受间接经验是完全有必要的，但是重视间接经验而不重视直接经验，那知识就不完全了。教师们下厂下矿使其知识趋向于比较完全，这种转变自然是好的转变。在学生方面，书本知识是比较缺乏的，也要向其缺乏方面发展。“学然后知不足，教然后知困”乃是“教学相长”的条件，也是教学质量进一步提高的动力。“年青的知识分子要虚心地向有学问的前辈学习，年长的知识分子也要学习青年知识分子的长处。”周总理这样提法益发鼓舞了广大教师和学生的积极性。所以摆在教师的前面是如何加强自我改造，如何提高业务知识（包括书本知识和实际知识），又如何与学生打成一片，在党的领导下，在教学相长的原则下，在教学过程中真正起到主导的作用，这是一个目前重要的问题。
    综上所述，一年来贯彻党的教育方针的结果是：学生们的社会主义、共产主义觉悟提高了，所获得的知识也比较丰富和完全了，体质也增强了，教学质量提高了，科学研究工作展开了，广大师生的阶级观点、劳动观点、集体观点和辩证唯物主义观点都受到了锻炼并提高了。这是党的教育方针的伟大胜利，是马克思列宁主义教育思想的伟大胜利，是广大师生在党的领导下鼓足干劲，力争上游的伟大胜利。当然贯彻方针的时间还不很长，经验还不很多，存在的问题也还不少，但我们只要在党的领导下，鼓起更大的干劲，精雕细刻，持久不懈，一切困难和问题都是可以克服和解决的。让广大的师生们团结起来为进一步贯彻党的教育方针、深入教育革命、继续提高教学质量而努力吧！
