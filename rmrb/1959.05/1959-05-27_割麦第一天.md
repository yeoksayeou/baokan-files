The First Day of Wheat Harvesting
By Our Reporters Fang Di and Luo Chongzhang

Around Sunrise
On May 23rd, the villages, big and small, of Qifanggang People's Commune in Zaoyang County, Hubei Province, woke up earlier than usual. This was the first day of the commune's large-scale rush to harvest wheat. For farmers, what could be more joyful than a bountiful harvest? What's more, this year's wheat harvest was so extraordinary, everyone said it would definitely be a much greater increase than last year's great harvest!

On this day, many commune members who had long exchanged "battle declarations" and were determined to compete in the wheat harvesting competition, got out of bed before the usual wake-up bell rang, inviting their companions, preparing to start the battle earlier than their "opponents." Before five o'clock, the members of Wanggang Production Team, led by Wang Shihe, a young Communist Party member who had challenged others, Wang Shicai, the militia captain, and Li Huaying, the women's team leader, began to arrive in the fields one after another and started the intense wheat harvesting battle. The members of Qifanggang Production Team and Pangang Production Team, who were competing with this team, were no later in starting work that day. Starting work so early, the fields were still a blur, and people could only see things within a few feet around them by the dim light of the already fading moon and stars. But no one paid attention to these things, and instead just carefully swung their sickles, cutting down the thick and dense wheat. The fields were so quiet, the "swish, swish" sound of the sharp sickles meeting the wheat stalks could be heard far and wide, how pleasant they were!

The sun finally peeked out from the eastern horizon, and a faint red glow painted the sky. The increasingly intense light completely dispelled the remnants of the night. The morning sun gently sprinkled on the plump wheat ears. Fields of ripe wheat shone dazzlingly. Those who had been single-mindedly harvesting wheat couldn't help but straighten their backs, admiring the alluring scenery of the harvest; singing praises. Gu Xiurong, a female commune member from Longxingsi Production Team, composed a ditty while harvesting wheat: "The yellow soil ridge is covered with gold, harvesting wheat is like cutting bamboo forest." Sun Kaijin, a sixty-five-year-old commune member, said with a hearty laugh: "My left hand can't pull the wheat, and my right hand can't cut the roots cleanly, don't blame me, the old man, for being weak, it's just because the wheat grows so well." The fields suddenly seemed particularly cheerful and lively.

Competing for the Red Flag

The thick wheat ears, strong stalks, large area, and even ripening made this year's wheat harvesting task of Qifanggang People's Commune greater than in any previous year, and it had to be completed as quickly as possible. This was, of course, arduous. But people had no fear of difficulties, they were confident that they would harvest all the ripe wheat cleanly on time. It was under this premise that teams, groups, and individuals, several days ago, found opponents to compete in wheat harvesting, and put forward competition conditions such as comparing work efficiency and quality. On this day, people planted red flags with their competition conditions written on them on the wheat bundles or field edges. The red flags fluttered in the wind, adding new splendor to the bountiful fields.

Yang Wenlan, the women's team leader of the second team of Gaoji Production Team, led the women's shock brigade and chose the men's shock brigade led by Gao Xinghua, the small team leader, as their opponent. They rushed to the fields before five o'clock in the morning and swung their sickles swiftly. By noon, they had each harvested an average of 1.1 mu, which was considered high according to normal efficiency, but when compared with their opponents, they had still harvested about 0.2 mu less per person. The women were not discouraged. They held a meeting in the wheat field at noon to discuss the reasons for not taking the lead in the morning: mainly that taking children home to breastfeed and sharpening knives in between had delayed work. When the competition continued in the afternoon, they asked their families to bring the children to the fields to breastfeed, and also brought whetstones to the fields, assigning a skilled knife sharpener to help everyone sharpen their sickles. As a result, their work efficiency in the afternoon was about twice as high as in the morning, catching up with and surpassing the men's team. Zhao Zhiying, a female commune member from Sunpo Production Team, competed with her husband, Guo Rongxiang. Because she started work a little later than her husband in the morning, she lost the morning competition. In the afternoon, she went to the field immediately after finishing lunch without letting her husband know, shortening the intermediate rest time, and finally caught up with her husband. The girls of the five sisters shock brigade led by Li Huaying, the women's team leader of Wanggang Production Team, in order to defeat their "opponent" - Zhang Guangfeng and other nine young women, came up with a way to save knife sharpening time, each carrying three sickles, so that the person did not stop when the knife stopped. In this day's wheat harvesting competition, people really raced against time.

This "chase" in the fields enabled many production teams to greatly overfulfill their original wheat harvesting tasks. The second team of Gaoji Production Team originally planned to harvest 323 mu of wheat in three days, but on this day, with the competition of eight wheat harvesting shock brigades, it was basically harvested in just one day. The task accepted by the five sisters shock brigade led by Li Huaying from the team was to harvest 45 mu of wheat in four and a half days, but based on the completion on the first day, it could be completed in just three days.

Go to the Fields

As soon as he finished breakfast, Dan Xinmin, the first secretary of the commune party committee, went to the fields. When he arrived at the second team of Wanggang Production Team, he joined the wheat harvesting ranks, asking the commune members while harvesting: "Who is harvesting the fastest?" A female commune member pointed her sickle at another young woman in front and said: "Li Huaying is the fastest." At this time, Li Huaying had already harvested a dozen feet ahead. Old Dan looked at some wheat ears and said to her: "Li Huaying, not only be fast, but also be careful, don't cut the unripe ones together!" Then he said in a consultative tone: "Look, this field has some wheat that is not ripe enough, why not harvest a ripe field first, and then harvest this one?" Everyone felt that the question he raised was very important. After a discussion, they moved to a completely ripe wheat field in the east. On this day, all levels of cadres in the commune, like Dan Xinmin, participated in the intense wheat harvesting with the commune members, and when they found any problems, they studied and solved them together with the masses. Xia Rufang, the general branch secretary of the Laojie Management District, found that the efficiency was generally not high when harvesting wheat with the masses in the first team of Yuanzhuang Production Team. After talking, he learned that this team had not implemented the principle of more pay for more work in the scoring standard for wheat harvesting, and everyone had opinions. After studying with the commune members, he helped this team to formulate a reasonable scoring method. The work efficiency in the afternoon was more than doubled compared to the morning. Going to the fields, this is not only a slogan of the cadres, the staff of all walks of life in the commune are also like this. More than eighty medical personnel and more than one hundred staff of the industrial and commercial system in the commune also went to the fields with the commune members after eating breakfast early in the morning, carrying medicine boxes and grocery stalls. They also carried sickles with them. On this day, all the shops in Qifang Town were closed, and it was difficult to buy daily necessities in the town. But in the fields, you could buy many cigarettes and daily necessities. It turned out that the commercial personnel had sent the goods to the fields. In the afternoon, we met Zhang Jiesan, a doctor from the commune health center, in the wheat field of Qifanggang Production Team. He was carrying a medical kit and a sickle, and was rushing to the first team. He told us that he had already run to nine teams and had treated twenty-six commune members with minor problems such as knife wounds and dizziness in the fields. In the canteen of the first team of Qifanggang Production Team, we met a cook carrying boiling water to the field. He told us: "Today, I have sent boiling water five times." The cooks of all canteens in the commune, in addition to getting up in the middle of the night to cook for everyone so that everyone could eat well, also had to constantly send boiling water to the wheat harvesting army. They were also busy for the wheat harvest.

The Day's Results

The sun set. Night covered the entire field. But the intense wheat harvesting battle was still going on. People used the light of the bright moon to continue harvesting wheat, and some transported the wheat bundles to the wheat field. When night had fallen, the joyful "ah-ho" sound still rang out from time to time in the fields. Some of the golden waves we saw during the day were now standing with wheat bundles, and some were already empty fields. When it was almost twelve o'clock in the midnight, people went home, and the fields returned to the unique silence of the early summer night. But at this time, in the wheat harvest headquarters and command posts of the commune and various production teams, the cadres were still busy, they wanted to summarize the day's results as the driving force for promoting people to better complete the wheat harvest. The materials provided by the commune wheat harvest headquarters proved: the first day of wheat harvesting was so brilliant! On this day, the whole commune harvested more than 36,000 mu of wheat, accounting for more than 30% of the total harvesting area. The commune originally planned to harvest all the wheat in four to five days, but the results of the first day made the commune wheat harvest headquarters make a new decision to complete the wheat harvest in just over three days.

    割麦第一天
    本报记者  方堤  罗重璋
            日出前后
      5月23日，湖北省枣阳县七方岗人民公社的大小村庄，比平常任何时候都醒得早。这是全公社开始大规模抢割小麦的第一天。对于农民来说，有什么事情比丰收更令人喜悦呢？何况今年的小麦丰收是那样不平凡，大家都说肯定会比大丰收的去年还要大大地增产！
    这一天，许多早就互送战表、决心要在割麦竞赛中比一比高低的社员们，在比平时早得多的起床钟还未敲响的时候，就已翻身下床，邀约自己的同伴，准备比自己的“对手”更早地投入战斗。还不到五点钟，王岗生产队的社员们，就在相互挑了战的青年共产党员王世合、民兵队长王世才和妇女队长李华英等分别领导的快速割麦突击组的带动下，陆续地赶到田间，开始了紧张地割麦战斗。和这个队竞赛的七方岗生产队和潘岗生产队的社员们，这天出工也不比他们晚。出工这样早，田野里还是模糊一片，人们只有借着已经显得黯淡的月亮和星光，才能看见周围几丈以内的东西。但谁也没有去注意这些，而只是用心地挥动着镰刀，把又粗又密的麦子割下来。田野是这样静寂，锋利的镰刀和麦秆相遇时发出的“唰唰”声，远远清晰可闻，它们是多么动听啊！
    太阳终于从东边地平线偷偷露出脸来，天际被抹上一层淡淡的红霞，越来越强烈的光辉完全驱散了残夜。朝阳轻撒在肥硕的麦穗上，成熟了的一片又一片的麦田，顿时，金浪耀眼。那些原来只顾一个劲割麦的突击手们，这时也不得不直起腰来，欣赏一下这撩人的丰收景色；唱起赞美的歌声。隆兴寺生产队的女社员顾秀荣，边割麦就边作了首顺口溜：“黄土岗上遍地金，割麦好像砍竹林。”六十五岁的老社员孙开金笑哈哈地说：“我左手拿麦拉不动，右手割麦不断根，不怪我老汉力气小，只因麦子长得好。”田野上突然显得格外愉快而又热闹了。
          竞赛夺红旗
    麦穗稠、麦秸壮、面积大，成熟齐，使今年七方岗人民公社的小麦收割任务比过去任何一年都大，而且必须尽快地突击完成。这当然是艰巨的。但是人们却没有畏难情绪，他们满怀信心地要按时把全部成熟的小麦干净地收割起来。正是在这个前提下，各队、组和个人，早在几天前，就分别找了比赛割麦的对手，提出了比工效，比质量等比赛条件。这一天，人们把写着自己竞赛条件的红旗，插在麦捆上或田头上边，红旗迎风飘舞，为这丰收的田野增添了新的光采。
    高集生产队第二小队妇女队长杨文兰领导的妇女突击组，选择了小队长高兴华领导的男子突击组作为自己的对手。她们在早上五点钟以前就一溜烟地赶到田间，矫捷地挥镰猛进。到中午每人平均已割完一亩一分，按平常效率来说，这算是高的了，可是和她们的对手比赛起来，每人还是少割二分左右。妇女们没有气馁，她们中午在麦地里开了个会，研究上午没有占先的原因主要是：有孩子的回家喂奶和中间磨刀耽搁了工夫。下午继续比赛时，她们叫家里把孩子送到田边来喂奶，同时还把磨刀石带到田里，抽出一个技术好的磨刀手负责帮大家磨镰刀。结果，她们下午的工效比上午提高约一倍，赶上并超过了男子组。孙坡生产队女社员赵芝英和自己的丈夫郭荣祥比赛，因为早上出工比丈夫稍晚了些，上午赛输了。下午，她一吃完午饭不让丈夫知道就下了地，缩短中间休息时间，最后还是赶上了她丈夫。王岗生产队妇女队长李华英领导的五姐妹突击组的姑娘们，为了战胜自己的“对手”——张广凤等九个青年妇女，想了一个节省磨刀时间的办法，每人带上三把镰刀，做到刀停人不停。在这一天的割麦竞赛中，人们真是分秒必争。
    这场田野里的“追逐”，使得许多生产小队大大超额完成了原定的割麦任务。高集生产队第二小队三百二十三亩小麦原计划三天割完，这一天组织八个割麦突击组竞赛，只一天就基本上割完了。李华英领导的五姐妹突击组，接受队里的任务是四天半割麦四十五亩，可是从第一天完成情况看，只要三天就可完成。
          到田间去
    一吃过早饭，公社党委第一书记但新民就下田了。赶到王岗生产队第二小队，就加入了割麦行列，边割边问社员们：“你们谁割得最快？”旁边一个女社员把镰刀指着前面另一青年妇女说：“得数李华英。”这时，李华英已经割在前面有丈把远了。老但看了看一些麦穗后对她说：“李华英，不但要快，还要细心，可不要把没熟的也一起割了！”接着他用商量的口气说：“你们看，这块田还有些麦子不够熟呢，不如先割块熟透了的，然后再割这块怎样？”大家觉得他提的问题很重要，一商量，就移到东面一块完全熟了的麦田去了。这一天，全公社各级干部也都和但新民一样，跟社员一道参加紧张的割麦，发现了什么问题就和群众共同研究解决。老街管理区总支书记夏如方，在袁庄生产队第一小队和群众一起割麦时，发现效率普遍不高，一交谈，才知道这个小队对于割麦的计分标准未贯彻多劳多得精神，大家有意见。经和社员们研究后，帮助这个小队订出一个合理的计分办法。下午工效就比上午提高一倍还多。到田间去，这不仅是干部们的口号，全公社各行各业的工作人员也都是这样。全社八十多个医务人员和一百多个工商系统的工作人员，这一天也跟社员们一样，清早吃完饭，就带着药箱和杂货担到田间去了。他们还随身带着镰刀。这一天，七方镇上看到所有商店都关了门，想在镇上买点日用品都困难。可是在田间，却可以买到许多香烟和日用品。原来商业人员都把货物送到田间去了。下午我们在七方岗生产队的麦地里碰到公社卫生院的医生张杰三，他带着一个医药包和镰刀，正匆匆地往一小队去，他告诉我们，已经跑了九个小队，在田间已给二十六个有些刀伤头晕等小毛病的社员看了病。在七方岗生产队第一小队的食堂，我们碰上一个炊事员挑着开水送到地里去，他告诉我们：“今天已经送了五次开水了。”全公社各食堂的炊事员们除了半夜起来为大家做饭让大家吃得好外，还要不断地给割麦大军送开水。他们也为麦收而忙。
          一天的战果
    太阳落山了。夜幕复盖着整个田野。但是紧张的割麦战斗仍在坚持着。人们借着明月的光辉有的继续割麦，有的把麦捆运到麦场上去。当夜幕已经降临的时候，田野上还不时响起充满喜悦的“啊嗬”声。白天我们看到的一些金浪翻腾的麦海，现在许多已是麦捆林立，有的已是一片空场了。大约快到午夜十二点时，人们都回家里了，田野里才恢复初夏夜间特有的静寂。可是，就在这时，公社和各生产队的麦收指挥部和指挥所里，干部们还在忙碌着，他们要把一天的战果总结起来，作为推动人们更好地完成麦收的动力。公社麦收指挥部提供的材料证明：割麦第一天的战果是多末辉煌啊！在这一天，全公社割完小麦三万六千多亩，占全部收割面积30％以上。这个公社原来打算在四到五天内把全部小麦割完，但第一天的战果，使公社麦收指挥部作出要在三天多一点的时间内完成麦收的新决定。（附图片）
