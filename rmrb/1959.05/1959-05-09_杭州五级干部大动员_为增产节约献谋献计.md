According to the Zhejiang Daily: The Hangzhou Municipal Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party recently convened a conference of five-level cadres in Hangzhou's industries. The conference reviewed and summarized the work of the first quarter, exposed and resolved the main contradictions existing in enterprises, unified understanding, and on this basis, discussed and studied the tasks for the second quarter. It mobilized the city's workers and masses to further boost their energy, strive for advancement, and launch a production increase and thrift campaign centered on technological revolution and technological innovation, to comprehensively fulfill and overfulfill the state plan for the second quarter.

More than 6,500 people attended the conference. The meeting adopted the methods of extensive airing of views, and communication between upper and lower levels, making it lively and dynamic.

Based on the practice of the first quarter, the conference launched a heated discussion on further promoting the production increase and thrift campaign, and on the issues of production guidelines and planning arrangements. How to achieve this year's Great Leap Forward? Should efforts be concentrated to guarantee key projects? Or should there be an all-round expansion, advancing simultaneously? Some comrades believed that to do things better and more, it was necessary to spread the work out more widely. Some comrades disagreed, believing that under the current situation where the raw materials industry could not meet the needs of production development, if there was an all-round expansion, without focusing on key projects, advancing simultaneously, it would inevitably lead to competition, and no one would be able to advance. Through discussion, the comrades attending the meeting further clarified the production policy of "shortening the front, concentrating forces, and guaranteeing key projects." Of course, while ensuring key projects, comprehensive arrangements should also be made for the production of general products and products needed for people's lives. Through this discussion, everyone felt that the tasks were clear and the mood was pleasant. They said, "The Party's policies are correct, key projects have enthusiasm, general projects also have enthusiasm, and everyone has enthusiasm." When the conference discussed planning arrangements, it first criticized the city leaders for shortcomings such as frequent changes in the plans, and delays in their issuance. Although these shortcomings could not be completely avoided due to lack of experience, economic work must become more and more detailed. As long as the masses are fully relied upon and investigation and research are strengthened, the plans can be made more practical. The so-called practical implementation must fall on the advanced "practicality." A practical plan is completely different from a backward plan. It is necessary to prevent some people from using the excuse of making the plan practical, one-sidedly emphasizing "stability and reliability," ignoring the subjective initiative of people, and blindly pulling down the targets. According to the above spirit, in arranging the tasks for the second quarter, the conference raised some of the production targets for the raw materials industry and daily necessities, and adjusted individual product targets that were not practical enough. Through the discussion of production guidelines and planning arrangements, people were once again vividly educated that they must make their subjective wishes conform to objective reality. Soaring enthusiasm must be combined with scientific analysis. Only in this way can the wisdom of the masses be brought into play, close the relationship between upper and lower levels, and do the work vigorously and practically. Should the factories that were set up during the Great Development undergo a process of rectification? This question sparked debate among the comrades present. Through discussion, everyone unanimously demanded a serious and systematic rectification, consolidation, and improvement of existing industrial and mining enterprises, and studied the content of the rectification, consolidation, and improvement: First, determine the production direction of the enterprise. According to the needs of the state and the production conditions of the enterprise, divide the product division of labor of the factories, and designate some factories to specialize in or concurrently engage in repair and assembly; some factories should vigorously produce small daily commodities. Second, determine the labor force. According to the principle of the most rational and effective use of manpower, quickly formulate labor quotas and fix the production personnel of the enterprise. Third, determine rules and regulations, establish and improve the enterprise economic accounting system, management system, and strengthen production organization. Fourth, rectify and improve the administrative management organization, and strengthen the production responsibility system. Fifth, establish and improve organizations for safe production, living welfare, and other organizations. The work of rectification, consolidation, and improvement must also be closely combined with the current production and construction work, promoting and facilitating each other.

The conference believed that the key to ensuring the completion and overfulfillment of this year's continued leap forward plan lies in further deepening the production increase and thrift campaign centered on technological revolution and technological innovation. In the discussion, everyone had different views on how to correctly understand the relationship between hard work, practical work, and clever work. Some people believed that "hard work" should be the main focus, as "hard work" yields quick results, while "clever work" is "distant water that cannot quench immediate thirst"; others believed that their units had weak technical strength and also had difficulties with raw materials, and had no conditions for "clever work," so "hard work" was more practical. Most people disagreed with the above opinions. They believed that the three are combined, and that "clever work" should be the main focus at present, and that only those with the spirit of "hard work" and "practical work" can truly achieve "clever work." "Clever work" is not "distant water," but "nearby water," because only it can fundamentally solve the key problems of production and double the efficiency of production. As for the conditions for "clever work," the key lies in bringing into play people's subjective initiative. "Clever work" itself can create conditions and overcome difficulties. Of course, the higher authorities should provide as much help as possible in terms of technology and materials. In the discussion, some worker representatives also criticized the leadership for not paying enough attention to technological innovation, and for not promoting it effectively. Some technological innovations were "a gust of wind" or "a three-day wonder"; some leading cadres took planes and trains to other places to learn a lot of advanced experience, but promoted very little of it. Some workers also examined their own superstitious and inferiority complexes regarding technological innovation. The conference studied that the current technological revolution must address key issues such as insufficient raw materials, poor product quality, insufficient production capacity, and a large proportion of manual operation, improve process design, improve operating levels, improve tools and equipment, and improve labor organization, thereby doubling labor productivity, saving raw materials, and improving product quality. The conference pointed out that each factory and enterprise must, in accordance with its own production situation and technical level, formulate a technological revolution plan around the Leap Forward plan, determine the current tasks and long-term directions, and propose catchy slogans for each period, so as to carry out the movement in a planned and step-by-step manner.

The conference also discussed the relationship between production and life, and between hard work and rest. In response to the urgent demands of the masses, such as reasonably arranging the time for workers to work, study, and rest, adjusting workers' dormitories, strengthening safe production, and doing a good job in cooling and preventing heatstroke, it also put forward suggestions for improvement. The cadres attending the meeting deeply realized that leaders must be resourceful and decisive, and that for major issues such as policies, plans, basic measures for implementing plans, and issues related to the vital interests of workers, they must be disclosed to the masses. This conference implemented this spirit in the discussion of the second quarter plan, so that the situation at the upper level was communicated to the lower level, and the situation at the lower level was communicated to the upper level, and the plan was made not only advanced but also practical, and everyone was full of confidence in completing and overfulfilling the plan. The leading cadres attending the meeting said that to truly follow the mass line and do things well, one must be resourceful, not only with cadres at the same level, but also with the broad masses; not only to listen to the opinions of the majority, but also to carefully consider the opinions of the minority. To be resourceful, one must be sincere, and truly seek advice and discuss matters. In this way, with opposing sides, contradictions can be revealed quickly and thoroughly. Only on this basis can one be "decisive."

Now, factories throughout the city are further deeply communicating and implementing the spirit of this conference, organizing and mobilizing the masses, and launching a new upsurge in the production increase and thrift campaign centered on technological revolution and technological innovation in the red May.

　　杭州五级干部大动员  为增产节约献谋献计
    据浙江日报消息：中共杭州市委最近召开了杭州市工业五级干部会议。这次会议检查和总结了第一季度的工作，揭露和解决了当前企业中存在的主要矛盾，统一认识，并在此基础上讨论和研究了第二季度的任务，动员全市职工群众，进一步鼓足干劲，力争上游，开展以技术革命和技术革新为中心的增产节约运动，全面完成和超额完成第二季度国家计划。
    出席这次会议的共六千五百余人。会议采取了大鸣大放、上下通气的方法，开得生动活泼。
    根据第一季度的实践，会议对于进一步开展增产节约运动，对于生产方针和计划安排问题展开了热烈的讨论。如何实现今年的大跃进，是集中力量保证重点呢？还是全面铺开，齐头并进？有的同志认为要把事情办得好一点，多一点，就必须把摊子铺得大一些。有些同志则不以为然，他们认为在当前原材料工业不能满足生产发展需要的情况下，如果全面铺开，不分重点，齐头并进，就势必你挤我，我挤你，结果大家都上不去。通过讨论，到会同志进一步明确了“缩短战线，集中力量，保证重点”的生产方针。当然，在确保重点的同时，对于一般生产和人民生活所需要的产品的生产也应予以全面安排。通过这次讨论，大家都感到任务明确，心情舒畅，他们说：“党的方针政策是正确的，重点有积极性，一般也有积极性，大家都有积极性”。会议在讨论到计划安排时，首先批评了市领导上对计划的安排变化多、下达迟等缺点。这些缺点，虽然由于缺乏经验，不能完全避免，但经济工作必须愈做愈细，只要充分依靠群众，加强调查研究，计划就能订得比较落实。所谓落实就是要落在先进的“实”上面，落实的计划与落后的计划截然不同，必须防止有些人借口计划要落实，片面强调“稳妥可靠”，忽视人的主观能动性，一味将指标往下拉的偏向。根据上述精神，会议在安排第二季度任务中，提高了一部分原材料工业和人民生活必需品的生产指标，并对个别不够落实的产品指标作了调整。通过对生产方针和计划安排的讨论，又一次生动地教育人们一定要使自己的主观愿望符合于客观实际，冲天干劲必须与科学分析相结合，只有这样，才能发挥群众智慧，密切上下关系，轰轰烈烈，踏踏实实地做好工作。在大发展中所办起来的工厂要不要经过一个整顿的过程？这问题引起了到会同志的争论。通过讨论，大家一致要求对现有工矿企业进行一次认真的、系统的整顿、巩固和提高，并研究了整顿、巩固、提高的内容：第一、定企业生产方向。根据国家的需要和企业生产条件，划分工厂的产品分工，指定部分工厂专任或兼任修配；有一部分工厂要大力生产日用小商品。第二、定劳动力。根据最合理和最有效地使用人力的原则，迅速制定劳动定额，固定企业生产人员。第三、定规章制度，建立和健全企业经济核算制度、管理制度，加强生产组织工作。第四、整顿和健全行政管理组织，加强生产责任制。第五、建立和健全安全生产、生活福利等组织。整顿、巩固、提高的工作，又要与当前的生产建设工作密切结合，互相推动，互相促进。
    会议认为要保证完成和超额完成今年的继续跃进的计划，关键在于进一步深入开展以技术革命和技术革新为中心的增产节约运动。在讨论中，大家对于如何正确理解苦干、实干、巧干三者之间的关系，有不同的看法。有人认为这三者应以“苦干”为主，“苦干”见效快，而“巧干”是“远水救不了近火”；也有人认为自己的单位中技术力量薄弱，原材料也有困难，没有条件“巧干”，还是“苦干”实惠。大多数人不同意以上意见。他们认为三者是互相结合的，当前应以“巧干”为主，而只有具备“苦干”、“实干”精神的人，才能真正做到“巧干”。“巧干”不是“远水”，而是“近水”，因为只有它才能从根本上解决生产的关键问题，使生产效率成倍提高。至于“巧干”的条件问题，关键在于发挥人的主观能动性，“巧干”本身就可以创造条件，克服困难。当然，上级部门在技术上，物质上应该尽可能地给予帮助。在讨论中，到会的部分工人代表还批评领导上对技术革新重视不够，推广不力，有些技术革新是“一阵风”、“三日鲜”；有的领导干部坐飞机、乘火车到外地去学了很多先进经验，但推广很少。有些工人也检查了自己对技术革新有迷信自卑思想。会议研究了当前技术革命必须针对原材料不足、产品质量不高、生产能力不足和手工操作比重大等关键问题，改进工艺设计，提高操作水平，改进工具设备，改善劳动组织，从而成倍地提高劳动生产率，节约原材料，提高产品质量。会议指出，各工厂企业必须按照自己的生产情况和技术水平，围绕着跃进计划，制订技术革命规划，确定当前的任务和长远的努力方向，并且提出各个时期的响亮的战斗口号，以便有计划，有步骤地开展运动。
    会议还讨论了生产与生活，苦战与休整的关系。又针对群众的迫切要求，如合理安排职工工作、学习、休息等时间、调整职工宿舍、加强安全生产、做好降温防暑等方面，也都提出了改进意见。到会干部深深体会到，领导者必须多谋善断，凡有关方针、政策、计划、实现计划的基本措施，及有关职工切身利益等方面的重大问题，一定要向群众交底。这次会议在讨论第二季度计划中，就是贯彻了这样的精神，使上情下达，下情上达，计划订得既先进又落实，大家对完成和超额完成计划就信心百倍。到会的领导干部说，要真正走群众路线，把事情办好，就要多谋，不但要与同级干部谋，而且要与广大群众谋；不但要听取多数人的意见，而且要认真考虑少数人的意见。谋一定要真谋，要真主意真商量，这样，有了对立面，矛盾才能揭露得快，揭露得彻底，在这样的基础上，才能“善断”。
    现在，全市各厂正在进一步深入传达和贯彻这次会议的精神，组织和发动群众，在红五月掀起一个以技术革命和技术革新为中心的增产节约运动的新高潮。
