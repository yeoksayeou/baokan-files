　　The Great Initiative
　　——The Fortieth Anniversary of the Communist Saturday Voluntary Labor
    Forty years ago, the first socialist country, the Soviet Republic, faced serious difficulties. Imperialism and its running dogs, the White Army, united to launch a frenzied attack on the young Soviet state, attempting to "strangle it in its cradle." In the spring of 1919, imperialist countries such as Britain, the United States, France, and Japan concentrated all their efforts against the Soviet Republic, covering the White armies of Kolchak, Yudenich, and Denikin in their attacks. At this critical juncture, Lenin proposed: "We must exert all our strength to defeat Kolchak." The Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) put forward the slogan "Everything for the Eastern Front!"

    In response to the call of the Party and Lenin, Moscow and Petrograd sent one-fifth of their Communist Party members and one-tenth of their trade union members to the front lines. The Communist Youth League sent thousands of the best young people to the Eastern Front. Those workers who could not go to the front lines demonstrated a spirit of revolutionary heroism with selfless labor on the rear labor front.

    On May 10, 1919, the Communist Party members and workers at the Moscow marshalling station of the Moscow-Kazan Railway, a railway line connecting the Eastern Front, initiated Communist Saturday voluntary labor to rush repair locomotives. On this occasion, 205 workers, with 1,014 working hours, repaired four locomotives and sixteen carriages, loading and unloading 9,300 poods of materials.

    Initially, some people thought that the significance of Communist Saturday voluntary labor was not great, but Lenin enthusiastically praised this move. Lenin mentioned its great significance in many speeches and articles. Lenin said: "Ordinary workers rise up, overcome enormous difficulties, and selflessly try to increase labor productivity, try to protect every pood of grain, coal, iron, and other products—these products do not belong to the laborers themselves or their 'close relatives,' but to their 'distant relatives,' that is, to the whole society, to the millions of people who initially united into a socialist country and then into a union of Soviet republics—this is the beginning of communism."

    Under the Red Army's annihilation, the White armies of Kolchak and others were defeated, but the serious threat of a fuel panic followed. In November 1919, the Central Committee of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) emphasized in a letter of instruction to Party organizations at all levels: "Saturday voluntary labor should be carried out more frequently, more actively, more systematically, and more organized, primarily using this labor to solve the fuel problem."

    On May 1, 1920 (Saturday), the All-Russian Communist Saturday Voluntary Labor was held. Lenin participated in this movement in the Kremlin. Since then, this movement has flourished throughout the Soviet Union, becoming the beginning of socialist labor emulation. (Pei Xi)

　　伟大的创举
　　——共产主义星期六义务劳动四十周年
    四十年前，第一个社会主义国家——苏维埃共和国面临着严重的困难；帝国主义及其走狗白匪军联合起来，向年青的苏维埃国家发动猖狂的进攻，妄图把它“扼杀在摇篮里”。1919年春天，英、美、法、日等帝国主义集中全力对付苏维埃共和国，他们掩护高尔察克、尤登尼奇、邓尼金等白匪军进攻苏维埃共和国。就在这危急存亡的关头，列宁提出：“必须竭尽一切力量来击溃高尔察克”。俄国共产党（布尔什维克）提出“一切为东线！”的口号。
    为响应党和列宁的号召，莫斯科和彼得格勒派了五分之一的共产党员和十分之一的职工会会员到前线去。共青团派了几千名最优秀的青年到东线去。不能到前线去的工人在后方劳动战线上表现了忘我劳动的革命英雄主义气概。
    1919年5月10日，联系东线的铁路干线莫斯科—喀山铁路莫斯科调车站的共产党员和工人发起了共产主义星期六义务劳动，抢修机车。这一次，二百零五个工人以一千零十四个工时，修好了四个机车和十六个车厢，装卸了九千三百普特材料。
    起初，有些人认为共产主义星期六义务劳动的意义不大，但是，列宁热烈赞扬这一举动。列宁曾在好些讲演和文章中，提到它的重大意义。列宁说：“普通工人起来克服极大的困难，奋不顾身地设法提高劳动生产率，设法保护每一普特粮食、煤、铁及其他产品，这些产品不归劳动者本人及其‘近亲’所有，而归他们的‘远亲’即归全社会所有，归起初联合为一个社会主义国家然后联合为苏维埃共和国联盟的千百万人所有，——这也就是共产主义的开始。”
    在红军歼击下，高尔察克等白匪败北了，但是，随之而来的是燃料恐慌的严重威胁。1919年11月，俄国共产党（布尔什维克）中央委员会在给各级党组织的指示信中强调说：“应当更经常地、更积极地、更有系统地、更有组织地进行星期六义务劳动，首先是利用这种劳动来解决燃料问题。”
    1920年5月1日（星期六），举行了全俄共产主义星期六义务劳动。列宁在克里姆林宫参加了这一运动。从此以后，这个运动在苏联各地蓬勃地开展着，成为社会主义劳动竞赛的开端。　（培熙）
