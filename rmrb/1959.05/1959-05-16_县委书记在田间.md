County Party Secretary in the Fields
By our reporter Huang Shaojin

In the evening glow, a field of rice waves rose and fell in the wind. The early rice seedlings in Luchuan County, Guangxi, had been transplanted for about twenty days. At this time, in the ?tang Second District in the northern suburbs of the county seat, three people were walking and talking on the field ridges in the afterglow of the setting sun. They were Wang Ying, the First Secretary of the Luchuan County Party Committee of the Communist Party of China, Secretary Lin Tingzhu, and Secretary Liu Jianling. With 80% of the county's spring planting tasks completed, the County Party Committee was considering how to proceed with the next stage of work. A wooden sign appeared by the roadside: "Seven Women's Experimental Field." This field was green, and the rice seedlings were two feet tall. Further ahead, several patches of thin, yellow seedlings appeared, only six inches tall. During this year's spring planting, several cold snaps were encountered, which froze some of the seedlings. It seemed that the replanted seedlings were congenitally deficient, and the seedlings grew unevenly. Suddenly, Wang Ying turned to the secretary and said, "Lao Liu, prepare, we'll go to the Ninth District tomorrow." The secretary knew that Secretary Wang was going to "dissect a sparrow" again. Since last year, the Luchuan County Party Committee has been organizing the next high tide immediately after a production high tide.

"Don't let the tail drag down the center"

The next day, Wang Ying and several cadres went to the Luoluo Brigade of the Qinghu Commune, where rice transplanting had started earlier than in other parts of the county. As soon as they arrived, they went to the fields near the entrance to look at the seedlings. In several fields, the seedlings were not growing well. After investigation, it was found that these were nursery fields, transplanted late, and with insufficient base fertilizer. Wang Ying asked the surrounding commune members, "Why don't you apply more manure?" A commune member said, "The early rice is not even ten days old, it will naturally turn green in ten days or so." After looking at the fields, on the way to the brigade headquarters, they met several young women who said they were going to the market. It was not market day. Wang Ying asked everyone, "Why aren't you working?" "The seedlings have all been transplanted." The women walked away giggling. It seemed that field management had not been given enough attention, and the old idea of "emphasizing planting and neglecting management" was at work again. Wang Ying's habit when participating in inspection work was to first go to the site to walk around, look, and talk, and then listen to the cadres' reports. The brigade reported that most of the early rice had been transplanted, and the earlier transplanted rice had been in the ground for more than twenty days. Weeding and topdressing had only been done on a small portion of the fields, while 70% to 80% of the labor force was rushing to finish the remaining transplanting. Wang Ying raised a question for everyone: "Now is the time when transplanting and field management are intertwined. Should we still focus on transplanting?" Ye Zongzhou, director of the Third Production Team, said, "Transplanting must seize the season, and the focus cannot be shifted to field management." Branch Secretary Zeng Yukun also believed that it would be easier to do the work after transplanting was finished. However, some people opposed this view, arguing that the focus should be on field management at present. It seemed that it was not easy to reach a consensus. Wang Ying said to the branch secretary, "Talk to everyone again and see if field management also needs to seize the season."

The next morning, the branch secretary reported some people's opinions. He said that everyone believed that transplanting needed to seize the season, and so did topdressing and weeding. Some old farmers also cited many examples to illustrate the importance of early topdressing and early weeding. This time, everyone's minds were opened. Wang Ying then said: The commune members' opinions are very correct. The effective tillering period of early rice is about twenty-five days after transplanting. This year, the seedlings are developing early and returning to green quickly. If we don't immediately topdress and weed, the 84% of the seedlings that have already been transplanted will suffer from acquired malnutrition. Therefore, the focus should be on field management at present, and the transplanting shouldn't drag down the field management. His remarks made the brigade cadres suddenly realize and they rearranged the labor force, immediately shifting the focus of their work.

Field Diagnosis

Wang Ying wrote a report to the County Party Committee, and "Don't let the tail drag down the center" became the County Party Committee's guiding ideology in production. 70% to 80% of the labor force in agricultural production across the county began to invest in field management. The initial focus of field management was weeding and topdressing, eliminating third-class seedlings, and breaking through the tillering stage. But what are the third-class seedlings this year? What are the reasons? How to eliminate them? The leadership was still unclear about this series of questions.

One night, the cadres were holding a meeting in Xianggao Village, and several farmers were invited to participate. Wang Ying suggested that everyone study the problem of eliminating third-class seedlings. The discussion led to a nursery field in Wuyatang, which was the most typical example of third-class seedlings, and some people called it "stubborn." It had been thirteen days since the field was transplanted, and no new leaves had grown. Everyone analyzed that the reason was that the seedlings were transplanted before they were strong after being frozen, and the quality of the seedling root fertilizer was not good. Therefore, no new leaves grew. Wang Ying asked everyone, "What's the prescription?" Some said to use human urine, some said to use chicken and duck manure, and some said to use cinder and saltpeter mud. Old farmer Pang Fuli said, "I think these four things should be used at the same time, let's call it 'four-flavor soup'." Everyone agreed. Suddenly, Brigade Leader Ye Zongqing said: "The 'four-flavor soup' should also be used according to the situation of the seedlings. I don't think the youth experimental field can use it. The 'four-flavor soup' has a high nitrogen content. Last year, some originally first-class seedlings blindly chased nitrogen fertilizer, resulting in lodging and very little harvest." The youth captain suddenly stood up and shouted, "I want to achieve high yields, I can't do without more nitrogen fertilizer." Suddenly, opinions varied. Someone suggested: "Let's go to the field for a consultation!" Wang Ying supported this opinion.

On April 5th, the branch secretary notified the captains of each team and the technical advisors, and invited several old farmers to Tangliao to carry out a clinical consultation on the field in the third team. A heated debate unfolded on the edge of the youth experimental field: most of the production team leaders advocated that the more refined fertilizer in the experimental field, the better, and the taller the seedlings grow, the better; an old farmer disagreed. He said: "The lodging seedlings last year were of this type. Applying fertilizer without looking at the seedlings is wasting fertilizer and wasting grain." At this time, Wang Ying thought of the dialogue he had with an old man on the roadside of the youth experimental field that day: "Your seedlings are really good this year!" The old man laughed, and then said seriously: "They are good now, but if you are not careful, they may not be good in the future." This old man sees the problem dialectically! Wang Ying asked everyone to recall if the situation last year was as the old farmer said. Some people nodded, but some people disagreed. Wang Ying further analyzed: "There are many seedlings replanted after the cold snap, and there are many nursery fields. It is estimated that the area of third-class seedlings will not be small. If everyone pours the refined fertilizer and manure into the first-class seedling fields, causing the good seedlings to lodge, and the third-class seedlings lack fertilizer, what will be the result?" Someone said: "A hunchback somersaults, losing on both ends." At this time, someone shouted: "If this is the case, overproduction will be a problem." Finally, it was unanimously agreed that these fields can only be lightly applied with grass ash and lime at present to promote strong and non-lodging stalks and more tillering. Wang Ying added a few words: "In the future, when dividing the standards of third-class seedlings, those seedlings that are too dense, showing a rooster tail, and at risk of lodging, should also be treated as third-class seedlings in order to attract people's attention."

In this way, Wang Ying identified and diagnosed all the more than 150 acres of land in Tangliao, field by field. At the final summary, he divided all the third-class seedlings into six types, and formulated prescriptions for each type according to the different conditions of seedling growth, variety, soil quality, and base fertilizer, prescribing the right medicine.

After the field consultation, Wang Ying immediately went to several production teams to check the implementation. He found that the medicine in some fields was not right, and some fields were still not weeded. He and the cadres studied together and found that although the original responsibility system had implemented sub-field management, it had not been implemented to everyone, and the enthusiasm of the masses had not been fully mobilized. So Wang Ying urged everyone to implement the responsibility system of "four guarantees" and "five to the field," so that every field had soldiers and every field had generals, and the field management work was carried out in an orderly manner.

Blossoming Everywhere

After Wang Ying rushed back to the county, he immediately convened a County Party Committee meeting. The County Party Committee believed that the situation of the Luoluo Brigade basically reflected the current production situation in the county: many nursery fields, slow greening of replanted seedlings after the cold snap, and uneven seedling growth. Field management is not only highly seasonal, but also has relatively complex technicality. Therefore, it is necessary to immediately launch a high tide of paddy field management throughout the county and promote advanced experience in a timely manner.

On April 12th, when more than 300 cadres from the county held an on-site meeting in the Luoluo Brigade, the seedlings here were growing luxuriantly, all of which were first-class seedlings. While watching, everyone listened to the introduction of the Luoluo Brigade. Everyone was convinced and praised in unison, "I have never seen such good seedlings!" A high tide of field management to "Learn from Luoluo" arose, and tens of thousands of people converged on the fields, acting as doctors and nurses, "to eliminate third-class seedlings." A new production upsurge was set off. Patches of third-class seedlings took off their yellow robes and put on green clothes. The County Party Committee believed that the new battle had begun, the measures had been implemented, and the responsibility of the leaders was to further push the waves and carry out the mass movement vigorously and solidly.

    县委书记在田间
    本报记者　黄绍进
    晚霞中，一片禾浪迎风起伏，广西陆川县的早稻秧苗，已经插下二十来天了。这时，县城北郊的?塘二区，有三个人，踏着夕阳的余辉，在田埂上走着、谈着。他们是中共陆川县委第一书记王英、书记林廷柱和秘书刘建龄。全县的春播任务，已完成80％了，县委正在考虑下一步的工作如何进行。路旁出现了一块木牌：“七女试验田”。这块田一片青绿，禾苗有两尺来高。再往前走，又出现了几块瘦黄的禾苗，才六寸多高。今年春播时，遇到几次寒潮，冻死了一些秧，看来补播的秧苗，都嫌先天不足，禾苗生长得很不整齐。突然，王英掉转头对秘书说：“老刘，准备一下，明天到九区去。”秘书知道王书记又要去“解剖麻雀”。从去年以来，陆川县委就是在一个生产高潮之后，就着手组织下一个高潮。
    “不让尾巴拖住中心”
    第二天，王英和几个干部到全县插秧较早的清湖公社陆落大队去。一到那里他们就到门口的田边去看禾苗。有几块田，禾苗长得不好，经过了解，这是秧地田，插得迟，基肥下得少。王英问周围的社员说：“为什么不多施些粪水呢？”一个社员说：“早禾不满十嘛，到十来天自然会转青的。”看完田，在去大队部的路上，又遇见几个青年妇女说是去赶集。这天不是集日。王英问大家：“你们怎么不出工呢？”“秧都插完了。”妇女们嘻笑地走过去了。看来，田间管理还没有被人重视起来，又是“重插轻管”的老观念在作怪。王英参加检查工作，习惯先到现场走走、看看、谈谈，然后才听干部的汇报。这个大队汇报的情况是：早稻已大部插下，早插的已经二十多天了，耘田追肥的仅仅很少一部分田，而70％到80％的劳动力在突击插秧扫尾。王英向大家提出一个问题：“当前正是插秧扫尾与田间管理两项工作交叉进行的时候，是不是仍然以插秧为中心呢？”第三作业区主任叶宗周说：“插秧要抢季节，不能把中心转到田间管理上去。”支部书记曾玉坤也认为插完再转，工作好做些。可是也有人反对这种意见，他们主张目前应该以田间管理为中心。看来意见一下子统一不起来。王英对支部书记说：“再找大家谈谈吧，看田间管理要不要抢季节。”
    翌晨，支部书记把一些人的意见作了汇报。他说，大家认为，插秧要抢季节，追肥耘田也要抢季节。有些老农还举了许多事例，说明早追肥早耘田的重要性。这一下，大家思想开朗了。王英这时才说：社员们的意见很正确，早稻有效分蘖期是插秧后的二十五天左右，今年禾苗发育早、返青快，如不马上追肥耘田，已插下的84％的禾苗就会形成后天失调。所以当前应该以田间管理为中心，不能让插秧扫尾拖住田间管理。他的这番话，使大队干部恍然大悟，重新安排了劳动力，马上转移了工作重心。
    田头会诊
    王英向县委写了报告，“不让尾巴拖住中心”成了县委当前在生产上的指导思想。全县农业生产方面的劳动力，70％到80％开始投入田间管理了。田间管理初期的中心问题是耘田追肥，消灭三类禾、大破分蘖关。但是今年的三类禾是哪些？原因何在？怎样消灭？这一系列的问题领导上还是心中无数的。
    一天晚上，干部们在向高村开碰头会，请了几个农民参加。王英建议大家研究消灭三类禾问题，一谈就谈到了乌鸦塘的一块秧地田，这是最典型的三类禾，有人叫它“老顽皮”。这块田插下十三天了，一直不长新叶。大家分析原因是秧苗受冻后还未育壮便插下去，秧根肥质量又不好，因此不长新叶。王英问大家：“怎么处方呢？”有人说要用人尿，有人说要用鸡鸭屎，有人说用火灰、硝泥。老农庞福利说：“我看这四样同时要用，就叫‘四味汤’吧。”大家一致同意了。忽然大队长叶宗庆说：“四味汤也要看禾施用。我看青年试验田就不能用。四味汤的氮肥重，去年有些原来的一类禾瞎追氮肥，结果倒伏了，收得很少。”青年队长忽的站起来嚷道：“我要搞高额丰产，不多下氮肥不行。”顿时意见纷纭。有人提议：“到田间会诊去吧！”王英支持这个意见。
    4月5日，支部书记通知各队队长、技术顾问，邀请几位老农，到第三队的唐寮垌临床会诊。在青年试验田边，展开了一场激烈的争论：大多数的生产队长，都主张试验田里精肥越多越好，禾苗长得越高越好；有一个老农却不同意。他说：“去年倒伏的禾苗，就是这种类型。不看禾施肥，是糟蹋肥料，糟蹋粮食。”这时，王英又想起了那天在青年试验田路边，和一个老头的对话：“今年你们的禾苗真好哇！”老头哈哈一笑，忽又认真地说：“现在是好，如果不小心，将来怕未必好。”这老头看问题很辩证呀！王英便叫大家回忆一下，去年是不是像那个老农所说的情况。有些人点点头，有些人却不同意。王英进一步分析说：“寒潮后补种的秧多，秧地田多，三类禾面积估计不会少的。如果大家把精肥粪尿都倒在一类禾田里，使好禾倒伏，而三类禾又缺肥，结果将会怎样呢？”有人说：“驼子打滚，两头落空。”这时有人叫起来：“这样搞法超产就成问题了。”最后一致认为：这类田目前只能薄施草木灰、石灰，促使禾秆稳壮不倒伏，多分蘖。王英又补充了几句：“今后划分三类禾标准时，应该把那些禾苗过于茂密、呈现鸡公尾、有倒伏危险的，也作为三类禾来处理，以便引起人们的警惕。”
    就这样，王英逐丘逐块地把唐寮垌的一百五十多亩田全部作了鉴定和诊断。最后总结时，他把所有三类禾，又分为六种类型，针对禾苗生长、品种、土质、基肥等不同情况，分别拟定了处方，对症下药。
    田头会诊以后，王英就立即深入到几个生产队去检查执行的情况，发现有些田的药不对方，有些田垌还没有人耘田，就又和干部们一起研究，发现原来的责任制度虽已实行分垌管理，但还没有落实到每一个人，群众的积极性还未全部调动起来。于是王英又督促大家执行“四包”“五到田”的责任制度，做到块块有兵，垌垌有将，田间管理工作进行得有条有理了。
    四面开花
    王英赶回县里后，立即召开了县委会议。县委认为陆落大队的情况，基本上反映了全县当前的生产形势：秧地田多、寒潮后补播的秧苗回青慢、禾苗生长不一致。田间管理不仅有强烈的季节性，而且有比较复杂的技术性。因此，必须立即在全县范围内掀起稻田管理热潮，并且及时地推广先进经验。
    4月12日，全县三百多个干部到陆落大队开现场会议时，这里的禾苗长得茁壮，全部是一类苗。大家一边看，一边听陆落大队的介绍，人人心服口服，众口齐夸“从未见过这么好的禾苗！”一个“学陆落”的田间管理高潮，风起云涌，成千成万的人会师田头，当医生、作护士，“要三类禾绝迹”。新的生产高潮掀起来了。一丘丘的三类禾苗脱下黄袍，穿上绿衣。县委认为，新的战役开始了，措施落实了，领导者的责任，就是要更进一步推波逐浪，把群众运动轰轰烈烈扎扎实实地开展起来。
