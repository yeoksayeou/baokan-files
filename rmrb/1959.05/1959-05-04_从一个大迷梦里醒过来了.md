From a Big Dream

Gu Jiegang, Member of the CPPCC, Discusses His Ideological Transformation Over Two Years

Chairman, esteemed members:

It has been over two years since the Third Session of the Second National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) in March 1957 until the convening of this First Session of the Third National Committee. Two years is not a very long time, but these two years have seen the political struggle of the Anti-Rightist Movement and the ideological battle of the Rectification Campaign, the production battle of the Great Leap Forward by the workers and peasants, and the nationwide rural people's commune movement. This series of struggles and movements have been epoch-making, and the achievements are also extremely fruitful. I am fortunate to participate in the CPPCC and the China Association for Promoting Democracy, personally experiencing and witnessing these struggles and movements, receiving profound education from all sides, which has made me, who has always been backward, willing to strengthen my fundamental self-transformation and contribute my strength to the cause of socialist construction.

Tranquility

I lived in the old society for more than fifty years. Under the long-term influence of landlord and bourgeois ideology, I fell deeply into the quagmire of individualism without realizing it. My lifelong goal was academic research, and I made plans and carried them out, thinking that this was also worthy of the motherland and the people. However, the materials available for research in academia are endless. I wanted to inherit the tradition of textual research but was in a turbulent era, unable to study in a systematic way like scholars of previous generations. I felt that my knowledge was insufficient and I needed to catch up with my predecessors in order to master all the knowledge in that field. Therefore, I spent years immersed in my work, forgetting that beyond my work there was also the politics and theory that guided my work. Not only did I not pay attention to politics and theory, but even when I picked up the newspaper every day, I only glanced at the headlines, so I was also vague about political struggles. After liberation, I certainly felt the invincible power of Marxism and that the people's regime and the reactionary regime were essentially different. But when it came to myself, I felt that I had always been someone who didn't ask about politics, so why should I get involved with politics and take away my working time? In addition, my memory was very poor, and I quickly forgot the new things I read. In this way, I inevitably had a feeling of "the setting sun is infinitely good, only it is near dusk," thinking that there was no need for an old person like me to follow the example of young people, lest I "draw a tiger and end up with a dog." Furthermore, decades of life in the study had cultivated a mood of tranquility, so even though people criticized me, I turned a deaf ear and continued to enjoy myself in my old profession.

Distress

In 1954, the Institute of History of the Chinese Academy of Sciences asked me to serve as a researcher, and I was very happy, because this solved my livelihood problems and allowed me to concentrate on research. Historical science is inherently a science with the most political combativeness, but I always felt that the study of knowledge should be divided, and those who engaged in theoretical work had their own people, so I might as well focus on sorting out historical materials. Who knew that as soon as I arrived in Beijing, one movement followed another, and I didn't get enough time to engage in research. Moreover, the CPPCC included me as a specially invited member, and there were even more meetings. Not only could my own plans not be realized, but even the tasks assigned to me by the Academy of Sciences could not be completed on time, and I felt very distressed. Whenever I received a meeting notice, I often lamented: "Today is ruined again! How can I concentrate my energy on my work?" In this uneasy mood of being unable to retreat and having no way to advance, I felt that all the functions of my body were showing signs of decline. I am really old!

In 1955, friends introduced me to join the China Association for Promoting Democracy. At that time, I thought, what role could someone like me who specializes in academics play in a democratic party? But I couldn't refuse their kindness, so I just added my name to the list. Who knew that a year later I would be elected as a central committee member? I only saw it as an honorary title and never thought about what responsibilities I should bear. Day and night, I was always thinking: in my life, my working time is at most only ten years, how can I squeeze out some time in this environment to do the work that I want to do and can do, and make some real contributions to future generations? As for the democratic parties, they were just an dispensable thing to me.

Alarm and Doubt

Unexpectedly, in the spring and summer of 1957, the rightists took advantage of the opportunity to help the Chinese Communist Party rectify its work style and launched a frantic attack on the Party. After June, the workers and peasants launched the vigorous Anti-Rightist Movement. During this time, I was recuperating and had the time to read the newspapers carefully. Every time I opened the newspaper, one or two rightists were my friends, and these friends, some were knowledgeable, some were talented, and often they were people I admired. I began to doubt, then hate, and finally, combining it with my own ideological reality, I deeply reflected and realized that I also had many rightist thoughts. But in the anti-rightist speeches at that time, intellectuals like me who came from the old society were called "bourgeois intellectuals," indicating that they belonged to two categories from "proletarian intellectuals," and were severely criticized. When I saw this, I felt repulsed, feeling that while political ideology had the distinction between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, objective scientific knowledge did not differ depending on a person's class, so why deny it altogether. It wasn't until the issue of red and expert was raised that I gradually understood that all academics serve politics, and scientific researchers should be red first and then expert; only by being both red and expert can they serve the people well.

Heart-to-Heart

Because of this initial understanding, in 1958, I willingly participated in the rectification movement of the Central Committee of the China Association for Promoting Democracy. The more heart-to-heart talks I wrote, the easier it was for my comrades to see my shortcomings, and thus help me with those shortcomings. After nearly a year of work, carefully analyzing and criticizing my own thoughts and behaviors, I realized that the root of my various erroneous thoughts lay in individualism, which was not only bourgeois but also landlord class. At the same time, it made me understand: why would the Party repeatedly try to win over someone like me who had never been close to the Party after liberation? This is because, under the policy of uniting, educating, and transforming the old intellectuals, they wanted me to embark on the socialist road and make a contribution to building a great motherland. The Party hoped for me and expected me so much, but I was inexplicably ignorant and wanted to bring the old ways into the new society. I didn't seek to understand the spiritual outlook of the new society, so I was tired of learning, avoided meetings, contradicted everywhere, complained about heaven and blamed others, but the Party still didn't abandon me and even educated me through the rectification of the China Association for Promoting Democracy. This was really too generous to me, they had too deep expectations of me, how could I not be grateful and ashamed! Thank you to the Anti-Rightist Movement for shouting loudly at me, and thank you to the Rectification Movement for warmly helping me, saving me from a big dream in a year and a half!

Joyful

From last year to this year, the CPPCC has repeatedly given us opportunities for visits and inspections. I went to Hebei, Henan, Hubei, and Hunan provinces. In the Great Leap Forward movement in industry and agriculture, in the people's commune movement, we saw the prosperity of the cities and villages there and the soaring enthusiasm of the workers and peasants, giving me new vitality everywhere, improving my ideological awareness, and making me want to keep up with the progress of the workers and peasants. In the old society, because I liked to travel, I had been to many rural and border areas, witnessing the arrogance of the imperialists, the corruption and brutality of the bureaucratic bourgeoisie, the bankruptcy of the countryside, and the displacement of the people. These tragic scenes were like pictures, deeply imprinted in my mind. After liberation, due to the great victory of the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, I realized that the motherland had become strong; now, after going out for a walk, seeing the achievements of the Great Leap Forward, I know that the motherland has become rich. Being in the old society, in order to have a little patriotism, I felt despair everywhere. Now the Party has paved a bright road, and no one's talents and strength cannot be used. Nature is also being transformed everywhere to serve the people. Compared with the past, how exciting and joyful this is for me! We saw a couplet on the Dongfeng Canal in Zhengzhou: "Hate that Chiang Kai-shek dug open the Huayuankou in the past, harming thousands of miles; rejoice that the Communist Party built the Dongfeng Sluice today, benefiting all people." It is the same Yellow River in Zhengzhou, but the reactionary regime used it to harm people, while the people's regime used it to benefit the people. Isn't this the difference between hell and heaven? Can we still not ask about politics and not accept transformation? Can we still not obey the leadership of the Party?

Rejuvenation

Vice Premier Li Fuchun said in his report this time: "The broad masses of employees are the most familiar with the equipment and tools they use, and they are also the most willing to innovate. ... We hope that all industrial and mining enterprises across the country can develop experience in this area, ... to make old equipment 'rejuvenate' and new equipment 'add icing on the cake,' and actively tap the potential of existing production equipment." This made me think that when I went out to visit this time, I saw that the machines used in many local industries were originally treated as waste products in Shanghai factories, but after the workers' creative repairs, they were actually put into production like new machines. I also saw in the Zhengzhou Textile Machinery Factory that the raw materials for the hardware factory in their people's commune-run small factory were scrap iron from the machinery factory, the raw materials for the paper mill were waste paper from the machinery factory, and the raw materials for the alcohol factory were rice washing water from the machinery factory. Not only are there no useless people, but there are also no useless things. Mr. Sun Yat-sen once said "make the best use of the land, make the best use of people's talents, and make the best use of things." At that time, it was just an ideal, but now it has all become a reality. What a gratifying thing! These old machines and waste products can still be repaired and processed to rejuvenate, why can't I, this person, and my knowledge be transformed to rejuvenate? I now fully realize that as long as I resolutely obey the six political criteria put forward by Chairman Mao, as long as I strengthen my self-transformation, negate my past outlook on life, correct my academic methods, and strive to participate in socialist college studies to improve my theoretical level, and through labor practice, change my position, I can adapt to the needs of the new society and serve socialism wholeheartedly. In this way, I will truly be rejuvenated. Of course, transformation is long-term, arduous, and complex, but I am determined to accept it and confident to realize it. I only make this guarantee to all comrades in this conference!

### 从一个大迷梦里醒过来了

    从一个大迷梦里醒过来了
    顾颉刚委员谈两年中的思想转变主席、各位委员：
    中国人民政治协商会议全国委员会从一九五七年三月举行了二届第三次全体会议以来，到这回三届第一次全体会议的召开，已经两年多了。两年，虽是一个不太长的时间，但在这两年里，有反右运动的政治斗争和整风运动的思想战斗，有工农群众全面大跃进的生产战斗，有全国农村人民公社化运动，这一系列的斗争和运动都是划时代的，战果也是极丰硕的。我欣幸参加政协和中国民主促进会，亲历了和目睹了这些斗争和运动，从四面八方受到了深刻的教育，使得一向落后的我愿意加强自我根本改造，并愿意为社会主义建设事业贡献出自己的力量。
    宁静
    我生活在旧社会里有五十多年之久，在地主阶级和资产阶级思想长期影响下，使我深深陷入到个人主义的泥坑里而不自觉。我一生以治学为目的，自己规定了计划做去，以为这样也对得起祖国和人民。可是学术界中，可供研究的资料是无穷无尽的。我既想继承考据学的传统而又处在动荡的时代里，不能像前代学者按部就班地学习，就觉得自己知识不够，亟须努力追上前人，方可掌握那方面的全部知识，因此穷年累月忙于业务，忘记了业务之外还有指导业务的政治和理论。不但不注意政治和理论，甚至每天拿到报纸，也只望望大标题，所以对于政治斗争也是模糊的。解放后，固然感到马克思主义的战无不胜的威力，人民政权和反动政权有本质的不同，可是一经联系到自己，就觉得我是向来不问政治的人，何必和政治发生关系，分去业务的工作时间呢？加以记忆力很差，读过的新东西很快就忘了，这样，又不免有“夕阳无限好，只是近黄昏”之感，以为老年人何必向青年人看齐，弄得“画虎不成反类犬”。又因数十年的书斋生活，养成了安于宁静的心情，所以尽管有人批评我，我竟充耳不闻，依然自得其乐地弄着我的老本行。
    苦闷
    一九五四年，中国科学院历史研究所叫我担任研究员，我非常高兴，为的从此解决了生活问题，更可以专心研究。历史科学本是一门最有政治战斗性的科学，但我总觉得研究学问应当分工，担任理论工作的自有其人，我不妨专在整理史料上致力。哪知一到北京，一个运动紧接着一个运动，得不着充分时间从事研究，而且全国政协又把我列入特邀委员，开会更多，不但自己的计划不得实现，就连科学院分配给我的任务也没法准时交卷，心中非常苦闷。每当接到一个开会通知的时候，常常懊恼道：“今天又完了！我的精神怎么能集中起来用到业务上呢？”在这样后退不能、前进又无路的不安心情之下，自己觉得身体上所有的机能都呈现了衰退的现象，我真的老了！
    一九五五年，朋友们介绍我加入民进。我当时想，像我这样专搞学术的人参加到民主党派里能起什么作用呢，不过人家的盛情难却，姑且列入一个名字而已。哪知隔了一年就被选为中央委员，我也只看成一个荣誉的头衔，并不曾想到我该负些什么责任。不论白天黑夜，我老是在想：在我的生命里，我的工作时间最多不过十年了，我怎样才可以在这个环境里抢出一点时间来做自己想做而又能做的工作，对后辈作些真实的贡献呢？至于民主党派，对我却只是一个可有可无的身外之物罢了。
    惊疑
    想不到到了一九五七年春夏间，右派分子借着帮助中国共产党整风的机会，向党猖狂进攻。六月以后，工农群众就发动了轰轰烈烈的反右运动。在这段时间里，我正在养病，有了细心读报的工夫。每天翻开报来，总有一两个右派分子是我的朋友，而且这些朋友，有的有学问，有的有才干，往往是我钦佩的人物。我始而疑，继而恨，终于结合了自己思想实际，深深反省，才认出自己也有不少的右派思想。可是在那时的反右言论中，称我辈从旧社会来的知识分子为“资产阶级知识分子”，表示和“无产阶级知识分子”属于两个范畴，并作严厉的批评，我看了起了反感，觉得政治思想固有无产阶级和资产阶级的分别，至于客观性的科学知识则并不因人的阶级而有不同，何必一起加以否定。直到后来红与专的问题提了出来，才使我渐渐明白：一切学术都是为政治服务的，科学研究者应当先红后专；只有红透专深，才能好好地为人民服务。
    交心
    由于有了这一点初步认识，所以到了一九五八年，我就心服口服地参加了民进中央的整风运动。交心条条写得多了，同志们就容易看出我的缺点，从而针对这些缺点给我以帮助。费了将近一年的工夫，把自己的思想和行为细细加以分析和批判，才看出我种种错误思想的根源就在于个人主义，不但是资产阶级的而且是地主阶级的。同时，使我又明白：像我这样一贯不靠拢党的人，为什么解放后党要屡次争取我，这就是因为要在对旧知识分子团结、教育、改造的政策之下，使我能够走上社会主义道路，为建设伟大的祖国尽一点责任。党这样地希望我，期待我，但我自己莫明其妙，还要把老一套搬到新社会里来，对于新社会的精神面貌一概不求甚解，以致厌烦学习，躲避开会，触处牴牾，怨天尤人，而党仍然没有抛弃我，还通过了民进的整风来教育我，这实在对我太优厚了，期望我太深切了，我哪能不感激，不愧悔！谢谢反右运动对我大喝一声，整风运动对我热忱帮助，在一年半的时间里面把我从一个大迷梦里救出来了！
    欢跃
    从去年到今年，政协屡次给我们参观和视察的机会，我到了河北、河南、湖北、湖南四省。在工农业大跃进运动中，在人民公社化运动中，给我们看到了那里的城市和乡村的繁荣状况和工农群众的冲天干劲，处处给我以新的生命力，提高了我的思想觉悟，使我发生了要跟上工农一起进步的要求。我在旧社会里，为了喜欢旅行，到过许多农村和边疆地区，目睹了那时帝国主义分子的蛮横，官僚资产阶级的腐化和残暴，农村的破产，人民的流离失所，这些惨象好像一幅幅的图画，深印在我的脑筋里。解放后，由于抗美援朝运动的伟大胜利，我才知道祖国强起来了；现在到外面一走，看到了大跃进的成就，才又知道祖国富起来了。处于旧社会的我，为了有一点爱国心，随处感到了绝望的悲哀。现在党已铺平了一条光明大道，没有一个人的才能和力气用不出来，大自然也处处受到了改造而为人民服务，这和过去一对比之下是怎么使我兴奋和欢跃呀！我们在郑州东风渠上看到一副对联：“恨昔日蒋介石扒开花园口，危害千里；喜今朝共产党建成东风闸，造福万民。”同是郑州的黄河，而反动政权拿来害人，人民政权拿来利民，这岂不是地狱和天堂的差异？我们再能不问政治，不接受改造吗？再能不服从党的领导吗？
    还童
    李富春副总理在这次报告里说：“广大的职工群众对于他们使用的设备和工具，是最熟悉的，也是最乐于加以革新的。……我们希望全国所有的工矿企业都能够发展这一方面的经验，……使旧设备‘返老还童’，使新设备‘锦上添花’，积极挖掘现有生产设备的潜力。”我因此想起，这回出去参观，目睹许多地方工业里用的机器，原来是上海工厂里作为废品处理的，只是经过工人们的创造性的修理之后，就居然像新机器一样投入生产了。我又在郑州纺织机械厂里看到他们的人民公社所办的小工厂，五金厂的原料是机械厂里的废铁，造纸厂的原料是机械厂里的废纸，酒精厂的原料是机械厂里的淘米水。不但人无废人，而且物无废物。孙中山先生曾说过“地尽其利，人尽其才，物尽其用”，在当时只是一种理想，而到现在则已一一成为事实，这是何等可喜的事情呵！这些旧机器和废品尚且可以经过了修理和加工而返老还童，为什么我这个人和我的知识不能经过了改造而返老还童呢？我现在已经充分认识到，只要坚决服从毛主席提出的六条政治标准，只要加强改造自己，否定我过去的人生观，端正我的治学方法，并争取参加社会主义学院学习，提高我的理论水平，通过劳动实践，转变立场，我就能适应新社会的需要，全心全意为社会主义服务。这样，我就真的返老还童了。固然改造是长期的、艰巨的、复杂的，但是我有决心接受，也有信心实现，我仅在这次大会中面对着诸位同志提出这个保证！
