　　Xinhua News Agency, 9th dispatch from Washington: Harriman, former Governor of New York and a major capitalist, who recently spent a month in India, testified before the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee on the 8th, viciously provoking discord between India and China and the Soviet Union. He emphasized that the United States should use all its power to unite India and Pakistan to form an alliance against communism, China, and the Soviet Union.

　　After groundlessly attempting to fabricate the so-called ghost story of Chinese and Soviet "intrusion" into India, Harriman viciously provoked, saying that India "does not intend to allow Russians or Chinese to enter their country."

　　Harriman then said: "We should try to unite the military forces of these two countries to jointly defend the subcontinent (referring to India and Pakistan), and not let them use these forces to fight each other."

　　Harriman admitted that the United States' continued military "aid" to Pakistan has caused great unease in India. But he also said that he does not favor reducing any obligations the United States has undertaken under the recently signed U.S.-Pakistan "Mutual Defense Agreement."

　　Harriman even denied that India is a neutral country. He said that although India pursues a policy of non-alignment, "it is not neutral with regard to those things that form the basis of our (American) constitution."

　　Harriman openly believed that India must rely on a large amount of foreign "aid" to develop. He said: "If it only gets a small amount of external assistance, India will be in a state of receiving relief, and its economy cannot develop." Therefore, he advocated that the United States should "aid India." However, he also made it clear that his so-called "aid" was originally imperialist capital export. The Associated Press reported Harriman's remarks, writing: "He said that this would not only encourage the United States, but also encourage the investment of private capital from other industrial countries."

### 美帝国主义分子挑拨印度同中苏关系  想拉印巴建立反共同盟

    美帝国主义分子挑拨印度同中苏关系
    想拉印巴建立反共同盟
    新华社9日讯　华盛顿消息：最近曾在印度进行了一个月活动的美国前纽约州长、大资本家哈里曼8日在美国参议院外交委员会作证时恶毒地挑拨印度同中国、苏联的关系，强调美国要用尽它所有的力量使印度和巴基斯坦联合起来，组成反对共产主义、反对中国和苏联的联盟。
    哈里曼无中生有地企图捏造所谓中苏对印度的侵入的鬼话后，就恶毒地挑拨说，印度“并不打算让俄国人或中国人进入他们的国家”。
    哈里曼接着就说：“我们应当设法使这两个国家的军事力量联合起来共同保卫这个次大陆（指印度与巴基斯坦），而不要让它们使用这些力量来互相作对。”
    哈里曼承认美国继续不断地对巴基斯坦的军事“援助”在印度引起了巨大的不安。但是他又说，他并不赞成削减美国根据最近签订的美—巴“共同防御协定”所承担下来的任何义务。
    哈里曼竟然否认印度是中立国家。他说，虽然印度奉行不结盟政策，但是“对于构成我们（美国）宪法基础的那些东西来说，（印度）并不是中立的”。
    哈里曼公然认为印度一定要依靠大量外“援”才能发展。他说：“如果只得到少量的外部援助，印度就处在领救济金的状态，它的经济就不可能发展。”因此他鼓吹美国要“援助印度”。不过他也表明，他的所谓“援助”原来是帝国主义资本输出。美联社报道哈里曼这段话时写道：“他说，这不仅将鼓励美国，而且还将鼓励其它工业国的私人资本的投资。”
