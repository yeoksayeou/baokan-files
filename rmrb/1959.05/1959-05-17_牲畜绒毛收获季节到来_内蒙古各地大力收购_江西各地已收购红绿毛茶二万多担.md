Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, 16th May: The livestock wool harvest season has arrived. Herdsmen and farmers in the grasslands and rural areas of Inner Mongolia are happily seizing the opportunity to shear various types of wool.

Inner Mongolia's wool production this year is high, and the quality has also improved significantly. The People's Committee of the Autonomous Region recently issued a call to herdsmen and farmers of all ethnic groups to strive to increase wool production, requiring that the sales volume of spring wool in the region this year increase by 20% to 30% compared with the same period last year.

Ike Zhao League, with the largest number of livestock and a warmer climate, has been fully engaged in shearing and purchasing wool since the end of April. In addition to planning to sell 3.44 million jin of various wools and cashmere this year, the League will also shear more than 100,000 jin of camel hair, cow hair, horse mane, and tail hair. In the west of Hulunbuir Prairie, the New Barag Right Banner, Mongolian herdsmen are also excitedly busy seizing cashmere and shearing horse manes and tails on pastures where young animals are abundant. It is estimated that the income from selling various wools to the state by each commune can reach about 150,000 yuan.

In order to complete the spring wool purchase task, commercial departments in various parts of Inner Mongolia have sent personnel deep into the People's Communes to provide technical guidance and do a good job in supplying tools and transporting wool. The Hairisu Supply and Marketing Cooperative of Ongniud Banner in Zhaowuda League organized local commune members of Mongolian men and women to improve cashmere seizing techniques, increasing the average output of cashmere per goat by half an ounce for the entire commune's 13,000 goats. Commercial departments in West Ujimqin Banner of Xilingol League dispatched a large number of mobile purchasing and sales vehicles during the peak wool season, going deep into the production teams and yurts of various communes to purchase wool and deliver the daily necessities needed by the herdsmen to their doorsteps, which was very popular among the masses.

Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, 16th May: Commercial departments in various parts of Jiangxi Province have already purchased more than 21,500 dan of red and green rough tea, an increase of 30% compared with the same period last year.

Since the province began purchasing new tea in April, various localities have promoted on-site purchasing, on-site storage, on-site packaging, on-site transportation, tasks, techniques, samples to the production teams, and the mass line work method of "democratic tea appraisal by comparing samples," which has made the purchasing work progress rapidly.

While carrying out purchasing activities, commercial departments in various localities have also gone deep into the grassroots to help farmers vigorously carry out technological innovation in tea primary processing. Up to now, commercial departments throughout the province have helped People's Communes in tea-producing areas build more than 200 new power, hydraulic, and animal-powered tea primary processing plants, and helped the masses add and repair many tools for picking and making tea, which has played a certain role in improving the quality of tea this year.

    牲畜绒毛收获季节到来
    内蒙古各地大力收购
    江西各地已收购红绿毛茶二万多担
    新华社呼和浩特16日电　牲畜绒毛的收获季节已到。内蒙古草原和农村的牧民和农民正在喜气洋洋地抓剪各种绒毛。
    内蒙古今年的绒毛产量大质量也有显著改进，自治区人民委员会最近向各族牧民农民发出努力增产绒毛的号召，要求全区今年春季绒毛的出售量比去年同期增长20％到30％。
    牲畜数量最多，气候较暖和的伊克昭盟，从4月末起就全面开始抓剪和收购绒毛的工作。全盟今年除计划出售各种羊毛羊绒三百四十四万斤外，还将抓剪骆驼毛、牛毛、马鬃尾等十万斤以上。呼伦贝尔草原西部新巴尔虎右旗，蒙古族牧民，也在幼畜丰收的牧场上兴奋地忙着抓羊绒，剪马鬃尾。预计各公社卖给国家各种绒毛的收入，约可以达到十五万元左右。
    为完成春季绒毛收购任务，内蒙古各地商业部门纷纷派出人员深入人民公社进行技术指导，并做好工具供应和绒毛调运工作。昭乌达盟翁牛特旗海日苏供销部，组织当地公社蒙古族男女社员改进了抓羊绒技术，使全社一万三千只山羊平均每只增产半两绒。锡林郭勒盟西乌珠穆沁旗商业部门，在绒毛旺季中出动大批流动购销车，深入各公社的生产队和蒙古包去，一面收购绒毛，一面把牧人们需要的生活用品送上门，很受群众欢迎。
    新华社南昌16日电　江西省各地商业部门目前已经收购红、绿毛茶二万一千五百多担，比去年同期的收购量增长30％。
    这个省从4月份起开始收购新茶以后，各地都推行了就地收购、就地保管、就地包装、就地运输，任务、技术、样品到生产队，以及“民主对样评茶”等群众路线的工作方法，使收购工作进展很快。
    各地商业部门在进行采购活动的同时，还深入基层帮助农民大搞茶叶初制技术革新。截至目前，全省商业部门已经帮助各产茶人民公社新建了二百多座动力、水力、畜力的茶叶初制厂，并帮助群众添补检修了许多采制茶叶的工具，对提高今年茶叶质量，起了一定的作用。
