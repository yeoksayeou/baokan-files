Guangzhou, 7th (reporter from this newspaper) The CCP Liangyang County Hailing Commune Committee in Guangdong Province recently launched a "Consolidate the Advanced, Attack the Backward" balanced production campaign throughout the commune, vigorously strengthening field management of backward fields to ensure a comprehensive and balanced increase in early rice production.

Due to the uneven depth of plowing, varying amounts of fertilizer application, the presence of both direct seeding and transplanting, and the cultivation of both Indica and Japonica rice varieties, the growth of rice seedlings in Hailing Commune was very inconsistent. In response, the Commune Party Committee proposed to plan wisely, fully follow the mass line, and manage this year's early rice well in all aspects.

To ensure that field management measures were reasonable and implemented effectively, each brigade in the commune established an advisory group of experienced farmers or a field management team combining cadres, experienced farmers, and technicians. Various forums were also held, field inspections and evaluations were conducted, and a professional field management team of over three thousand people was formed. Through bottom-up and top-down approaches, management measures were formulated for each type of field.

The Commune Party Committee believed that ensuring a bumper harvest this year required guaranteeing a large-scale balanced increase in production. Therefore, the commune leadership decided to adopt the approach of grasping both ends to drive the middle: For first-class seedlings, the focus was on preventing lodging by draining water to expose the fields to sunlight and applying more potash fertilizer to make the seedlings grow stronger. For third-class seedlings, rapid-acting fertilizer was applied aggressively to promote rapid growth and development.

The entire commune mobilized over five thousand laborers, forming two teams led by branch secretaries and brigade leaders respectively, to consolidate first-class seedlings and attack third-class seedlings. Pang Jitung, the First Secretary of the Commune Party Committee, personally went to Pinglan Brigade, where the seedlings were growing the worst, to help rescue the backward seedlings. He promptly organized more than twenty fishing boats to go to sea to collect and transport seaweed fertilizer. After several days of concentrated rescue efforts, the entire brigade's 1,600 mu of backward seedlings quickly turned green and grew stronger. After field inspection, the cadres of Pingzhang Brigade criticized the passive sentiment towards rescuing backward seedlings. The brigade immediately transferred 50% of its labor force to form a team to rescue the backward seedlings. Fertilizer was also concentrated on the backward seedlings. In this way, 750 mu of backward seedlings were treated in one day.

Currently, the campaign to strive for balanced production and focus on backward fields is still being carried out in a comprehensive and in-depth manner.

### 力争早稻大面积平衡增产  海陵公社加强管理落后田

    力争早稻大面积平衡增产
    海陵公社加强管理落后田
    本报广州7日电　中共广东省两阳县海陵公社党委最近在全社开展了“巩固先进，突击落后”的平衡生产运动，大力加强对落后田的田间管理工作。确保早稻全面平衡增产。
    海陵公社早稻田由于深翻程度不一，施肥多少不一；有直播有插秧；有籼稻也有粳稻，因而禾苗的生长情况很不一致。公社党委针对这种情况，提出要多谋善断，充分走群众路线，把今年早稻全面管好。
    为了使田间管理措施订得合理和落实，公社各大队都分别成立了老农顾问组，或干部、老农、技术员三结合的田间管理小组，同时还召开各种座谈会，进行田间检查评比，成立了三千多人的田间管理专业队伍，通过自下而上，上下结合的方法，订出了各类田的管理措施。
    公社党委认为要确保今年的大丰收，必须保证大面积平衡增产。因此，公社领导上确定采取抓两头，带动中间的办法：对一类禾着重防倒伏，实行排水晒田，增施钾肥，使禾苗生长粗壮；三类禾则猛追速效肥，使禾苗快长快发。
    全社五千多个劳动力组成两套人马，分别由支部书记和大队长带领，进行巩固一类禾，突击三类禾的斗争。公社党委第一书记庞积通亲自深入到禾苗生长最差的平兰大队，帮助抢救落后禾，及时组织了二十多只渔船出海积运海肥，经过几天的突击抢救，全队一千六百亩落后禾苗迅速回青转壮。平章大队的干部经过田间检查，批判了对抢救落后禾的消极情绪，大队立即抽调了50％的劳力组成抢救落后禾队伍。肥料也集中施在落后禾。这样，一天就处理了落后禾七百五十亩。
    目前，争取平衡生产，大抓落后田的运动还在全面深入地开展。
