Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, May 10th:

    Lamas from many temples in Lhasa, who were coerced into participating in the rebellion, have, after being captured or surrendering, accused the former Tibetan local government and upper-class reactionaries of coercing them to participate in the rebellion.

    They accused that during the Great Prayer Festival in February this year, when Tibetan monks and laypeople gathered in Lhasa for religious assemblies, the rebel elements also began their reactionary conspiracies in Lhasa, coercing lamas to join the rebellion. The twenty-four-year-old lama, Losai, was deceived and coerced into joining the rebellion at the Jokhang Temple by rebel elements and reactionary lamas, such as Niqiong Bazha and Dengzeng Nima. On March 10th, Dengzeng Nima ordered Losai and other lamas to take gasoline and liquor to burn down the bridge over the Liusha River. At that time, Losai and several other lamas were unwilling to go. Dengzeng Nima immediately threatened and deceived them, saying, "You all have amulets on you, what are you afraid of! But you must not shrink back. If you retreat, the amulet won't work." Losai and others had no choice but to go and burn the bridge. When burning the bridge, because they had little fuel, it would not catch fire. A rebel element even took off his kasaya on the spot, dipped it in gasoline, and used it to start the fire.

    Jianzhen Suolang, Dengbo Piqiong, Dengbo Querang, and others are all lamas from the Drepung Monastery. They revealed the activities of the bandits, saying that on the second day of the second month of the Tibetan calendar (i.e., March 11th), the rebel elements in Drepung Monastery summoned more than 1,000 lamas for registration. They ordered that lamas between the ages of fifteen and sixty must be ready to be summoned at any time to participate in the rebellion, and they also formed a lamas "dare-to-die corps." The rebel leaders Qiangcun and Nazha, seeing that some lamas were unwilling to join the "dare-to-die corps," threatened, "You have to go even if you don't want to! Anyone who doesn't go will have their barley rations suspended for a year and be expelled from the monastery!" Thus, batches of so-called "dare-to-die corps" were sent to Norbulingka. Fifty lamas who were always with Dengbo Piqiong were organized into five squads, issued British rifles, and forced to cooperate with the Tibetan army's Gusong Daiben to participate in the rebellion. Jianzhen Suolang, Dengbo Querang, and fifty other lamas were organized into a "dare-to-die corps" and sent to the trenches south of Norbulingka to "fight side by side" with the Khampa rebel elements who had fled to Lhasa. During the rebellion, several Zizhong (fourth-rank monk officials) often inspected and commanded the fortifications, and threatened, "No one is allowed to retreat. Anyone who retreats will be shot!"

    Dengbo Piqiong and others also accused that on the sixth day of the second month of the Tibetan calendar (i.e., March 15th), the Zizhong in charge of commanding the "dare-to-die corps" gave the following order: "It is very inconvenient for us to wear lama clothes and carry guns. The red kasaya also easily exposes our targets. We must all change into plain clothes." Dengbo Querang said, "According to the monastery's rules, it is not allowed to change into plain clothes in the temple, but this time, the superiors ordered us to change into plain clothes." He also said that the kasayas they took off, although the Zizhong said they would keep them for them, were actually taken to wrap guns and ammunition. Dengbo Piqiong confirmed: "At noon on the sixth day of the second month of the Tibetan calendar, I personally saw a large batch of guns and ammunition, handled by Lama Apinze, being taken from the Kashag, all wrapped in kasayas, loaded onto three carriages, and transported to Drepung Monastery."

    西藏叛国集团胁迫喇嘛参加叛乱
    被俘人员揭露出大量罪恶事实
    新华社拉萨10日电　拉萨许多寺庙被胁从参加叛乱的喇嘛在被俘或投降后，控诉原西藏地方政府和上层反动分子胁迫他们参加叛乱的罪行。
    他们控诉说，今年2月传召期间，藏族僧俗人民聚集在拉萨进行宗教集会的时候，叛乱分子也在拉萨开始了反动的阴谋活动，胁迫喇嘛参加叛乱。二十四岁的喇嘛洛塞，就是在大昭寺受叛乱分子、反动喇嘛尼穷巴札、登增尼玛等的欺骗胁迫而参加了叛乱的。3月10日，登增尼玛命令洛塞和其他喇嘛，带着汽油、烧酒，去烧毁流沙河上的桥梁。当时，洛塞和其他几个喇嘛不愿去，登增尼玛立刻一边威胁一边欺骗地说：“你们身上都带有护身符，怕什么！但是，你们千万不得退缩，往后一退，这护身符就不管用了。”洛塞等人只好去烧桥了。烧桥的时候，因为带的燃料少，烧不着，有一个叛乱分子，竟当场把袈裟脱了下来，沾上汽油引火。
    坚贞索朗、登波丕穷、登波却让等人都是哲蚌寺的喇嘛。他们揭露叛匪的活动说，藏历2月初2（即3月11日）那天，哲蚌寺的叛乱分子曾经召集喇嘛一千多人进行登记，并且下令从十五岁到六十岁的喇嘛，都要随时听候召唤，参加叛乱，还组成了喇嘛“敢死队”。叛匪头目强村和那札看到有的喇嘛不愿当“敢死队”，便威胁说：“不去也要去！谁不去，就停发一年青稞，驱逐出寺！”于是，一批一批所谓“敢死队”被送到了罗布林卡。一向和登波丕穷在一起的五十个喇嘛，被编成五个班，配发了英国步枪，被迫配合藏军古松代本参加叛乱。坚贞索朗、登波却让等五十名喇嘛，被编成“敢死队”，派到罗布林卡南面的战壕里，与逃到拉萨的康巴叛乱分子“并肩作战”。在叛乱中，几个孜仲（四品僧官）经常到工事里视察指挥，并且威胁说：“任何人都不能向后退却，谁要退缩，就枪毙谁！”
    登波丕穷等还控诉，在藏历二月初六（即3月15日）那天，负责指挥“敢死队”的孜仲曾经下了这样的命令：“我们穿着喇嘛衣服带枪行动，很不方便，红色袈裟也容易暴露目标，要一律换上便装。”登波却让说：“按照寺庙的教规，本来是不允许在庙内换便衣的，这一回，上边却命令我们换便衣。”他又说，他们换下来的袈裟，孜仲虽说是替他们保存起来，其实是拿去包裹枪支弹药。登波丕穷证实说：“藏历二月初六中午，我亲眼看见由喇嘛阿品则经手，从噶厦那里领出的大批枪支弹药，都是用袈裟包着的，装了三辆马车，运到哲蚌寺去。”（附图片）
    西藏叛乱平息了，西藏人民新的、自由幸福的生活就要开始。祖祖辈辈受尽欺压和奴役的人们，如今开怀畅笑了。这是拉萨人民在平叛大会上欢庆平叛胜利的一个镜头　　　　　　新华社稿
