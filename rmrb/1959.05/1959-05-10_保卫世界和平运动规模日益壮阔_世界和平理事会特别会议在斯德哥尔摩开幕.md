Xinhua News Agency, Stockholm, 8th: The special session of the World Peace Council solemnly opened this afternoon in the Stockholm Civic Hall. Approximately 300 delegates from over 60 countries, including many outstanding leaders and fighters for world peace, attended today's meeting.

　　The meeting was opened by Mrs. Andrea Andreen of Sweden. She welcomed all the delegates and proposed a minute of silence for the late Chairman of the World Peace Council, Frédéric Joliot-Curie, and other deceased peace fighters. Mrs. Andreen, recalling the famous Stockholm Peace Appeal adopted nine years ago in the same hall, pointed out that the basic principles of the peace movement have achieved significant victories in the past decade, preventing the expansion of conflicts and the use of nuclear weapons.

　　The chairman then announced that prominent activists of the peace movement would speak, and enthusiastic applause resounded throughout the hall.

　　The first speaker was Mrs. Eugénie Cotton of France, who traced the development of the peace movement after the war, especially Joliot-Curie's activities and contributions to the peace movement. She emphasized that the peace movement should constantly adapt to the development of the international situation and always maintain its breadth, dynamism, and unity.

　　The Soviet writer Korneichuk spoke of how the idea of peaceful coexistence is taking root more and more deeply in people's hearts. He called for a halt to nuclear weapons testing and the abolition of all nuclear weapons. After elaborating on the peace movement as a broad alliance against war, Korneichuk pointed out the great role of the Soviet government and Comrade Khrushchev in defending peace. He suggested that the meeting make its own demands to the upcoming Geneva Foreign Ministers' Conference and called on everyone to advance for peace. Korneichuk's brilliant speech received great attention from the delegates.

　　Mrs. Maria Rosa Oliver of Argentina then spoke. She vividly introduced the tortuous process of awakening and growth of the Latin American people after the war. She pointed out that a new trend against war and for national independence is emerging in Latin America. The people demand not only political independence but also economic liberation.

　　The next speaker was Guo Moruo. Guo Moruo said that the world peace movement has undergone magnificent development in the past decade. The various calls made by the World Peace Council for maintaining world peace have received more and more support from the broad masses of the people. The development of the world peace movement reflects the common and strong desire of people from all countries to defend peace and oppose war. The great achievements of socialist countries in peaceful construction, the successive victories of national independence movements, and the surging struggles of people from all countries to defend peace have greatly encouraged and strengthened the confidence and determination of the people of the world to fight for peace.

　　Guo Moruo also pointed out that the Chinese people have always fully supported every call of the World Peace Council. Our country regards defending peace as a task of paramount importance. We have made unremitting efforts in the past decade and are willing to further strive for the complete elimination of war and the enhancement of human happiness in the future.

　　Mr. Ouandi of Cameroon paid tribute to the African peace fighters at the conference. He pointed out that the African national liberation movement has developed greatly in the past decade, but the colonialists are still carrying out bloody suppression in many regions. The African people refuse to become victims of warmongers and have great expectations for the peace movement.

　　Mrs. Langevin-Joliot, the daughter of Frédéric Joliot-Curie, was also invited to speak at the meeting. She called on scientists to oppose nuclear weapons and contribute to the cause of peace.

　　The chairman of the meeting announced that the meeting had received a large number of congratulatory telegrams from all over the world. The telegrams read out at today's meeting included those from Khrushchev, Soong Ching-ling, Zhou Enlai, Ho Chi Minh, Sukarno, Qasim, Novotny, Queen Mother Elizabeth of Belgium, Grotewohl, Minich, Yugov, Cárdenas, Mendès-France, Mrs. Nehru, as well as the International Federation of Women, the South African People's Congress, and the Asian-African Solidarity Committee, totaling more than 20 telegrams.

　　The World Peace Council also presented the 10th Anniversary Medal of the Peace Movement to the delegates attending the meeting.

　　Professor John Bernal of Britain, Vice-Chairman of the World Peace Council, then gave a report to the delegates entitled "The Work and Prospects of the World Peace Movement."

　　The meeting adjourned after Bernal's report. The plenary session will continue tomorrow morning.

　　Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 8th: Today's "Pravda" and "Izvestia" published editorials on the special session of the World Peace Council held in Stockholm.

　　"Pravda's" editorial said that ten years have passed since the First World Peace Congress was held. Over the years, the strength of the socialist camp, which has persistently opposed war and strived to consolidate international security, has been greatly enhanced. The Soviet people have made tremendous contributions to the cause of peace. Today, the struggle for peace has become the affair of the people of the world. The movement to defend peace has grown and consolidated over the past decade, mobilizing the broad masses of the people and exerting a huge influence on post-war international policy.

　　The editorial then pointed out that the upcoming Foreign Ministers' Conference in Geneva is a great victory for the world's peace forces. The editorial also said that the struggle for peace must continue unabated, and a high degree of vigilance must be maintained against the aggressive forces of imperialism.

　　"Izvestia's" editorial said that the great socialist camp is an inexhaustible and powerful source of the movement to defend peace. The working people of socialist countries are making immeasurable contributions to solving the most important problem of today—maintaining world peace—with their great achievements in socialist and communist construction. The editorial pointed out that the cause of peace can only be victorious through the resolute struggle of the people of all countries.
