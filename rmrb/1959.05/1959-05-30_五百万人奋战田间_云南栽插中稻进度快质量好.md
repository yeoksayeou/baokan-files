Five Million People Fight in the Fields
Yunnan's Mid-Season Rice Planting Progresses Rapidly and with Good Quality

Kunming Dispatch: (This paper) May 29th. In most areas of the Yunnan plateau, spring planting and summer harvesting have entered the final stages. Currently, more than five million laborers in the province are fully engaged in mid-season rice planting. Under the battle cry of "Great Battle in Red May, Planting for a Full House," mid-season rice planting has formed a massive mass movement. The progress has been greatly accelerated, from the original 160,000 mu planted per day to more than 350,000 mu, while ensuring quality. As of May 25, the province had planted six million mu of mid-season rice, accounting for 35.1% of the planned area.

Yuxi Prefecture, which has the fastest progress, had Party committees at all levels personally going to the front line at the beginning of the rice planting season. They focused on the main problems directly related to the progress of planting, such as water conservancy, draft cattle, and labor, and seriously solved them. Many communes along the river in the entire region have erected thousands of waterwheels, pumping water day and night to irrigate the fields. An army of more than 400,000 laborers is fighting hard in the fields. So far, 66% of the prefecture's more than one million mu of mid-season rice fields have been planted. Many communes have also rushed to plow and plant rice in long-abandoned paddy fields, over fulfilling the rice planting task. The people's communes in the Chuxiong Yi Autonomous Prefecture, based on the characteristics of early rainfall this year, have prepared two sets of plans to adapt to changes in sunny and rainy weather, so as not to be caught off guard and ensure timely planting. In Yongshan County, this prefecture, the progress of rice planting was originally slow. Through organizing cooperation between the mountainous areas and the dams, as of the 21st of this month, the county had completed 73% of its rice planting task.

The main reason for the rapid progress and high quality of mid-season rice planting in Yunnan Province this year is that all communes in the province have carried out contract production work, which has greatly mobilized the production enthusiasm of the masses. For example, the Third Production Team of the Second Management Area of the Housuo Commune in Fuyuan County, Qujing Prefecture, was originally extremely backward in production. After contracting production, all members except two sick people worked full time.

Currently, all parts of the province have concentrated their superior forces to rush to plant, seize the season, grasp the quality, catch up with the progress, and good news continues to come. (Ma Lie)

    五百万人奋战田间
    云南栽插中稻进度快质量好
    本报昆明29日电　云南高原上大部地区春播和夏收都已进入扫尾阶段。目前全省五百多万个劳动力，全力投入了中稻栽插。各地在“大战红五月，栽插满堂红”的战斗口号下，中稻栽插已形成一个声势浩大的群众运动，进度大大加快，由原来的日插十六万多亩，提高到三十五万多亩，并保证了质量。到5月25日止，全省已栽插中稻六百万亩，占计划数的35.1％。
    进度最快的玉溪专区，一开始插秧各级党委都亲自上前线，抓住直接关系栽插进展的水利、耕牛、劳力等主要问题，认真加以解决。全区沿河的许多公社，架起了成千上万台水车，昼夜不停地车水灌田，四十多万劳动大军苦战在田间，到现在全区一百多万亩中稻田已经栽插了66％。不少公社还把多年丢荒的稻田，突击翻犁插上了秧，超额完成了水稻栽插任务。楚雄彝族自治州的各个人民公社，根据今年雨水来得早的特点，打好两套谱，以适应晴雨变化，做到临阵不乱，保证及时栽插。这个专区的永善县，原来插秧进度迟缓，通过组织山区下坝协作，到本月21日止，全县稻谷栽插任务已经完成了73％。
    今年云南省中稻栽插进度快、质量高，最主要的原因是全省各个公社都进行了包产工作，大大调动了群众的生产积极性。如曲靖专区的富源县后所公社第二管理区第三生产队，在生产上原来极为落后，包产后，除了两个病人外，全部出满工。
    现全省各地，都集中了优势兵力突击栽插，抢节令，抓质量，赶进度，捷报不断传来。　（马烈）
