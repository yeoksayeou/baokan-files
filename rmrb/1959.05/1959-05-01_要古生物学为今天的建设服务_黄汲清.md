Comrades,

We completely agree with Premier Zhou Enlai's government work report and the reports of Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian. Premier Zhou's report scientifically summarizes the glorious achievements of the Great Leap Forward in China's industry and agriculture in 1958 and correctly puts forward the various tasks on the economic front in 1959—also a task of the Great Leap Forward. For this document of great historical significance, we, as people's representatives, must not only study it in depth but also publicize and explain it to the masses so that the people of the whole country can understand its spirit and work together to make the greatest efforts to complete this glorious task.

We are geological scientists and are now willing to talk about the new atmosphere that has recently emerged in geological science work and some of our experiences from the perspective of science serving production and construction.

Paleontology is a science between geology and biology. It is not a theoretical science, but a science with practical value. At present, a new situation of large-scale mass movement has emerged in this science.

There is a science in geological science called paleontology, which is a science between geology and biology. Its research object is the remains of organisms preserved in strata—animal fossils and plant fossils. We know that various useful minerals are buried in strata. To understand the distribution laws of minerals, we must first understand the stratigraphic sequence, and the establishment of the stratigraphic sequence must rely on paleontological research. It can be seen that paleontology, contrary to what some people understand, is not a theoretical science, but a science with practical value. Unfortunately, paleontology in old China embarked on the wrong path of research for the sake of research. Today, under the call of the Party's correct policy of science serving production, the situation is completely different. In order to establish the stratigraphic system of some areas of our country in a timely manner and better serve geological production, the Chinese Academy of Sciences and relevant departments such as the Ministry of Geology, the Ministry of Petroleum Industry, the Ministry of Coal Industry, and the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry have decided to convene a national stratigraphic conference in August this year. And the Ministry of Geology, the Ministry of Petroleum, the Ministry of Coal and the units affiliated to the Chinese Academy of Sciences are responsible for holding ten on-site conferences on mineral stratigraphy and regional stratigraphy with preparation, content, and combination of national construction. In order to find new oil fields in eastern China, new coal fields in the Hexi Corridor, rich iron ore in central China, and to find and expand phosphate resources in northern China, five sedimentary mineral stratigraphy conferences or professional conferences were held in Changchun, Lanzhou, Xinyu in Jiangxi, Dengfeng in Henan, and Beijing. In order to establish regional stratigraphic division and comparison standards in southeastern China, the Nanling area, southwestern China, northwestern China, and northern China, five regional stratigraphy on-site conferences were held in Hangzhou, Guangzhou, Guiyang, Lanzhou, and Taiyuan. These on-site conferences are scheduled to be held between March and July. These on-site conferences are all in preparation for the national stratigraphy conference to be held in August. The basic tasks of the National Stratigraphic Conference are two: First, to discuss and solve the important sedimentary mineral problems of oil fields, coal, iron, copper, aluminum, and phosphorus in my country; Second, to discuss and solve the important issues in the division and comparison of regional stratigraphy in my country, stratigraphic comparison tables and stratigraphic norms for all periods (ie, all geological ages) and regions in the country. The leaders of the Chinese Academy of Sciences have called on all the staff of the Nanjing Institute of Geology and Paleontology to participate in this work. Now all the staff of the Institute are going to the relevant areas to carry out stratigraphic research with the spirit of exerting their efforts to strive for the top. All the staff of the Institute are concentrating their efforts to compile the national stratigraphic comparison table, a comprehensive stratigraphic summary report for each geological era, and six sedimentary mineral stratigraphic reports. At the same time, paleontological workers from the Ministry of Geology, the Ministry of Petroleum, and various geological colleges have also been mobilized to participate in the on-site conference and the preparation of the stratigraphic comparison table. It is estimated that there are no less than four or five hundred paleontological workers currently engaged in intense labor for the same purpose, including old scholars over sixty years old, as well as young men and women in their twenties. This is indeed a new situation of science serving production, and it is also an unprecedented new situation of large-scale mass movement in scientific work, especially in paleontological work. The reason why this situation is valuable is that it is carried out under the "national chess game", that is, the great collaboration of all relevant departments in the country. I believe that under the wise leadership of the Party Committee of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the stratigraphic conference will be very successful.

In order to compile the national mineral distribution law map, teachers and students of geological colleges, geological exploration workers, and personnel from relevant units of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, the Ministry of Coal Industry, and the Ministry of Geology are working together to carry out intensive labor. This kind of multi-departmental and multi-service collaboration is the first time in the history of geological science research.

The main aspect of geological science serving production and construction is the study of mineral distribution laws. The more in-depth and detailed our understanding of the laws of mineral distribution, the more confident we will be in the arrangement of prospecting and exploration work, and the more quickly, better, and more economically we can establish various mineral raw material bases for the country. The Ministry of Geology established the Institute of Geology in 1956, and its main task is the study of national mineral distribution laws. To study the laws of mineral distribution, it is necessary to compile mineral distribution maps, geological maps, geotectonic maps, sedimentary facies maps, etc., and finally produce mineral prediction maps, pointing out specific locations for prospecting and mineral exploration. Over the years, the Institute of Geology has taken the compilation of the national mineral distribution law map as its primary task and has invested huge efforts in its work. However, the scale of the national maps is very small and has no practical significance for guiding prospecting and exploration. Therefore, they want to assist one or two provincial bureaus in compiling large-scale mineral distribution law maps. Fortunately, Changchun Geological College has cooperated with Liaoning, Jilin, and Hebei provinces for several years and has carried out a large amount of geological prospecting work in these provinces. Based on these work results, the leaders of the Geological College decided to compile the metallogenic law map of the above-mentioned areas and regard this map as the main item for the "May 1st" gift. The Institute of Geology of the Ministry of Geology seized this good opportunity and decided to conduct a pilot project of map compilation in Changchun. In order to achieve the three combinations of scientific research, teaching, and production, in addition to the teachers and students of the Geological College as the main force, everyone unanimously agreed to invite relevant production units to send people to participate in the map compilation. Within a week, in addition to the Jilin, Liaoning, Hebei, Heilongjiang Geological Bureaus and the Songliao Petroleum Prospecting Team of the Ministry of Geology system, the relevant units of the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry, the Ministry of Coal Industry, and the Ministry of Petroleum Industry also brought relevant materials to participate. Because the results of geophysical exploration play an important role in understanding the laws of mineral distribution, the Ministry of Geology's Airborne Magnetometry Brigade, 903 and 906 Aerial Survey Teams, and the Songliao Plain Geophysical Exploration Team were also invited to participate. It is estimated that there are about 30 professors and teachers, more than 20 engineers and technicians, and more than 100 fourth-year students directly participating in the map compilation. These staff members are organized into several large groups and several small groups. Under the unified command of the Party Group of the Geological College and under the responsible guidance of several professors and senior engineers, they are working day and night in the famous Geological Palace in Changchun City. This is another new situation of great collaboration in geological science research. The reason why this new situation deserves our special attention is that under the call of the Party's national chess game, geological work has changed from the past individual households and the organizational form of lower-level societies to the "advanced cooperative" form of comprehensive large-scale collaboration in a leap-forward posture. This multi-departmental and multi-service collaboration is indeed the first time in the history of geological science research.

We have participated in and will continue to participate in the above-mentioned large-scale collaboration work. We have received a great education, and our initial experience is very deep. We deeply feel that only under the wise leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, only under the brilliant light of the General Line, can the geological cause closely cooperate with the national industrial plan and achieve great development; only under the guidance of the policy of theory serving practice and science serving production and construction can geological science play its due role in geological production, mainly in prospecting and exploration, geological research work, especially paleontological research, can be given due attention without being regarded as useless. Only after the great rectification movement, under the greatly improved political awareness of scientific and technical personnel and the broad masses, and under the call of the Party's national chess game, can geological scientists abandon individualistic plans, overcome the idea of ​​mutual distrust, accept the direct leadership of the Party, and participate in large-scale collaboration of dozens or hundreds of people to work for the same research task. In this new type of large-scale collaboration, even if a few people still have selfish ideas and opinions, they will soon be discovered by the masses and receive due criticism. Therefore, participating in large-scale collaboration can not only improve business skills, but also get good training in political thought.

We are all old intellectuals. Premier Zhou said in his report, "It is wrong to think that old intellectuals no longer need to carry out self-transformation..." Yes, continuing to carry out self-transformation is necessary and arduous, but we are not afraid of difficulties. We resolutely demand to lean towards the Party and absolutely obey the leadership of the Party. We demand to participate in physical labor and live with the working people to improve our level of ideological awareness. Continue to study Marxism-Leninism and Chairman Mao's works. Participate in large-scale collaboration in business work, follow the mass line, and learn from the masses at any time. We demand to cultivate ourselves into both red and expert cadres in a relatively short period of time and do more useful things for the Party and the people.

    要古生物学为今天的建设服务
    黄汲清　斯行健代表的联合发言各位代表：
    我们完全同意周恩来总理的政府工作报告和李富春、李先念两位副总理的报告。周总理的报告科学地总结了我国一九五八年工农业方面大跃进的辉煌成就，正确地提出了一九五九年经济战线上的各项任务——同样也是一个大跃进的任务。对这一具有重大历史意义的文件，我们人民代表一方面必需深入学习，一方面还要在群众中进行宣传解释，务使全国人民都能体会它的精神实质，共同为完成这一光荣的任务而作最大的努力。
    我们是地质科学工作者，现在愿意从科学为生产建设服务这一角度谈一谈地质科学工作中最近出现的新气象和我们的一些体会。
    古生物学是介于地质学和生物学间的科学，不是理论性的科学，而是富有实用价值的科学，目前在这门科学中已出现了大搞群众运动的新局面
    地质科学中有一门叫古生物学，它是介于地质学与生物学间的科学，它的研究对象是保存在地层中的生物遗体——动物化石和植物化石。我们知道各种有用矿产都埋藏在地层中，要搞清矿产的分布规律，首先要搞清地层次序，而地层次序的建立必需依靠古生物的研究。由此可见，古生物学和一部分人所理解的相反，不是一种理论性的科学而恰恰是富有实用价值的科学。遗憾的是旧中国的古生物学走上了为研究而研究的错误道路，今天在党的科学为生产服务的正确方针号召下，情况完全不同了。为了及时建立我国若干地区的地层系统，更好地为地质生产服务，科学院和地质部、石油工业部、煤炭工业部、冶金工业部等有关部门决定在今年八月召开全国地层会议。并且分别由地质部、石油部、煤炭部和科学院所属单位负责开好有准备的、有内容的、结合国家建设的矿产地层和区域地层的十个现场会议。为了在我国东部寻找新油田，在河西走廊寻找新煤田，在华中寻找富铁矿并在华北寻找和扩大磷矿资源的任务，分别在长春、兰州、江西新喻、河南登封和北京等地举行五个沉积矿产地层会议或专业会议。为了在我国东南区、南岭区、西南区、西北区和华北区树立区域地层划分和对比的标准，分别在杭州、广州、贵阳、兰州和太原等地举行五个区域地层现场会议。这些现场会议决定在三月至七月这一期间召开。这些现场会议都是为了开好八月间召开的全国地层会议而准备的。全国地层会议的基本任务有二：第一，讨论和解决我国油田、煤、铁、铜、铝、磷重要沉积矿产问题；第二，讨论和解决我国区域地层划分和对比中的重要问题、全国各纪
  （即各地质时代）、各区地层对比表及地层规范问题。科学院领导方面已经号召南京的地质古生物研究所的全体人员参加这一工作，现在全所人员都以鼓足干劲力争上游的精神分别到各有关地区进行地层的研究工作。全所人员正在集中精力，编制全国地层对比表，和各个地质时代的全面的地层工作总结报告，及六种沉积矿产地层报告。与此同时地质部、石油部和各地质学院的古生物工作者也都动员起来参加现场会议和地层对比表的准备工作。估计目前为同一目的而进行紧张劳动的古生物工作者不下四五百人，其中有年逾花甲的老学者，也有二十多岁的小伙子和姑娘们。这确是科学为生产服务的新局面，同时也是科学工作中、特别是古生物学工作中大搞群众运动的史无前例的新局面。这一局面之所以可贵还在于它是在“全国一盘棋”、也就是全国各有关部门大协作之下搞起来的。相信在科学院党委的英明领导下，地层会议一定能开得非常成功。
    为了编制全国矿产分布规律图，地质学院师生，地质勘探工作人员以及冶金工业部，煤炭工业部和地质部有关单位人员正在通力协作，紧张劳动，这种多部门、多兵种的大协作，在地质科学研究工作中还是开天辟地第一回
    地质科学为生产建设服务的主要方面是矿产分布规律的研究。对矿产分布规律的了解愈深入细致，则我们对普查勘探工作的布置将愈有把握，愈能多快好省地为国家建立各种矿物原料基地。地质部在一九五六年成立了地质研究所，它的主要任务就是全国矿产分布规律的研究。研究矿产分布规律必需编制矿产分布图，地质图、大地构造图、沉积岩相图等图件，最后产生矿产预测图，指出普查找矿的具体地点。地质研究所年来已把编制全国矿产分布规律图作为自己的首要任务，并已投入巨大力量进行工作。不过全国性的图件比例尺很小，没有指导普查勘探的实际意义，因此他们想协助一两个省局进行大比例尺的矿产分布规律图的编制工作。值得庆幸的是长春地质学院几年来与辽宁、吉林、河北各省协作，进行了各该省区大量的地质普查工作。以这些工作成果为基础，地质学院领导方面决定编制上述地区的成矿规律图，并把这一图件作为“五一”献礼的主要项目。地质部地质研究所抓住这一良好机会决定在长春进行编图的试点工作。为了达到科学研究、教学、生产三结合，除了以地质学院师生为主力军外，大家一致同意邀请有关生产单位派人参加编图。在一周之内携带有关资料前来参加者除地质部系统的吉林、辽宁、河北、黑龙江地质局和松辽石油普查大队外，还有冶金工业部、煤炭工业部和石油工业部的各有关单位。由于地球物理探矿的成果对了解矿产分布规律起着重大作用，还邀请了地质部航空磁测大队，903和906航测队，松辽平原物探大队等单位参加。计直接参加编图的人员有教授教员约三十人，工程师技术员二十余人，四年级学生一百多人。这些工作人员被编成几个大组和若干小组，在地质学院党组的统一指挥下，在几位教授和高级工程师的负责指导下，正在长春市有名的地质宫进行夜以继日的非常紧张的劳动。这又是一个地质科学研究工作大协作的新局面。这一新局面之所以值得我们特别重视是在党的全国一盘棋的号召下，地质工作已由过去的单干户和低级社的组织形式，以跃进姿态一变而为全面大协作的“高级合作社”形式。这次多部门和多兵种的大协作在地质科学研究工作中确是开天辟地第一回。
    我们曾经分别参加而且还要继续参加上面所说的大协作工作。我们受到的教育很大，我们的初步体会很深。我们深深感觉到只有在共产党和毛主席的英明领导下，只有在总路线的光辉照耀下，地质事业才能紧密地配合国家工业计划得到长足的发展；只有在理论为实践服务、科学为生产建设服务方针的指导下，地质科学才能在地质生产、主要在普查勘探中起应有的作用，地质研究工作特别是古生物研究才能得到应有的重视，而不致于被看成是无用的东西。也只有在伟大的整风运动以后，在科学技术人员和广大群众的政治觉悟大大提高的情况下，在党的全国一盘棋的号召下，地质科学工作者才能抛弃个人主义的打算，克服互不信赖的念头，接受党的直接领导，参加几十人几百人的大协作，为同一的研究任务进行劳动。在这新型的大协作中纵有少数人仍有自私自利的想法和看法，也必将很快地被群众所发见而受到应有的批判。所以参加大协作不但在业务上可以得到提高，而且在政治思想上也可以得到很好的锻炼。
    我们都是旧知识分子，周总理在报告中说，“以为旧知识分子已经不需要再进行自我改造……是不对的”。是的，继续进行自我改造是必要的也是艰苦的，但我们不怕困难。我们坚决要求靠拢党，绝对服从党的领导。要求参加体力劳动，同劳动人民一起生活，以提高自己的思想觉悟水平。继续学习马克思列宁主义和毛主席的著作。在业务工作中参加大协作，走群众路线，并随时向群众学习。要求在一个较短的时期内把自己培养成为又红又专的干部，为党为人民多作一些有益的事情。
