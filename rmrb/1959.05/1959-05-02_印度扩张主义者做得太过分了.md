Comrade Chairman, fellow members:

I completely agree with Premier Zhou's report and the various reports of the two conferences. I wholeheartedly support the Central People's Government's resolute measures to quell the rebellion in Tibet.

The Chinese People Are Not to Be Bullied

Tibet is an inseparable part of our motherland's territory; this is undeniable by anyone. Recently, imperialist elements and Indian expansionists, with guilty consciences and swollen heads, have dared to blatantly interfere in our internal affairs, attempting to make a big issue out of the Tibetan rebellion, clamoring for "Tibetan independence." This is absolutely intolerable to us. Tibetan reactionaries who betrayed the motherland and abducted the Dalai Lama are the scum and enemies of the Chinese nation. They fled to neighboring India, and we see that Indian expansionists and certain political activists not only failed to express a fair attitude but also opened their doors to accommodate them. Some Indian officials even distributed so-called Dalai statements hostile to the Chinese people. Is this adhering to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence? Is this a friendly gesture? We greatly cherish the traditional friendship between China and India, and we have always upheld the Five Principles we jointly proposed, but we must never allow Indian expansionists to undermine the Five Principles, and we must never allow Indian expansionists to use this friendship as a shield for their interference in China's internal affairs. Those interfering have gone too far. They should take stock of themselves, and look at the calendar. Do they think the Chinese people are easy to bully now? No! The Chinese people are not to be bullied now! If the interferers do not immediately pull back from the brink, and stubbornly continue their reckless actions, the Chinese people will not stand idly by.

We all know the Dalai Lama; he is the Vice-Chairman of the National People's Congress. He has repeatedly expressed his support for the central government and safeguarding the unity of the socialist motherland, and wrote three letters to General Tan Guansan when he was abducted. This is the real Dalai Lama we are familiar with. As for the "Dalai Lama" who twice issued so-called "Dalai Lama's statements," he is a stranger to us because his words do not sound like the words of a Chinese, let alone the words of a Tibetan compatriot. They sound very much like the words of Indian expansionists. Also, how could the Dalai Lama authorize the Dalai Lama to write statements and issue statements? Therefore, we have reason to suspect that the "Dalai Lama" who issued the so-called "Dalai Lama's statements" is a fake Dalai Lama. The facts are clear: The Dalai Lama was abducted by the Tibetan reactionary group, and under the direct manipulation of Indian expansionists, he cannot possibly express his sincere love for the motherland and support for the central government. Regardless of how many statements or talks he makes now or in the future, as long as the voice is not the Dalai Lama's voice we are familiar with, it is nothing more than the interferers using his name. We sternly warn the expansionists: the Chinese people are not to be bullied, China's sovereignty is not to be infringed upon, and China's internal affairs are not to be interfered with. Any despicable attempt to expand territorial ambitions by taking advantage of the Tibetan rebellion is doomed to a shameful failure.

The Party's Care for Insurgent Personnel

The People's Republic of China will soon be ten years old. The changes over the past decade, especially the Great Leap Forward last year, and the great initiative of the people's communes, are truly earth-shattering and joyful. I have been on the side of the people for almost ten years now. The facts of the past ten years prove that the Party's policy of winning over, uniting, educating, and reforming insurgent personnel is incomparably great and correct. All those who revolted with me have now been given appropriate arrangements, and the vast majority of them have made progress to varying degrees, contributing to the construction of the motherland. Some who have reformed well and made rapid progress have even gloriously joined the Communist Party of China. Looking back over the past ten years, the Party's care and education for the insurgent personnel have been truly painstaking and benevolent. Although we insurgent personnel have made some progress, we must not be complacent. The idea that reform is almost complete is unrealistic. Reforming one's thinking and striving for progress is everyone's own business, so it is called "self-reform." It cannot be done by others. The Party can only make arrangements in work and life for the insurgent personnel, and can only help and educate them, providing conditions for promoting progress in all aspects. Whether or not one makes progress and whether or not one reforms well still depends on one's own consciousness, one's own efforts, and one's own responsibility. Others cannot replace it, and the Party cannot take it over. Now it can be affirmed that the majority of the insurgent personnel have made progress, but the progress is still far from enough. We must continue to strengthen self-reform in the practice of serving socialism, according to the six criteria indicated by Chairman Mao. Over the past ten years, I myself have also made progress, but the progress is still not enough. The current me and the me of ten years ago, whether in terms of ideological understanding, work methods, lifestyle, temperament, etc., can be said to have changed a lot. I am not saying that I have been reformed well, but I am explaining that the Party's education and cultivation of me over the past ten years have been meticulous. My understanding is not profound, but I am confident in one thing, that is, to specifically accept the Party's leadership. The more you listen to the Party, the more you confide in the Party, the more you can overcome your own weaknesses and increase your own wisdom. Otherwise, superficial understanding and unstable footing will slow down progress. Therefore, it is said: "Of all things, the Party's leadership is the most important." As long as you earnestly and specifically listen to the Party and frequently confide in the Party, self-reform will be faster. There can be no falseness in this. It is not easy to shift from the old standpoint to the new standpoint. It takes countless practices to complete such a shift. For example, participating in physical labor, which I used to think was low and lowly, I not only don't dislike now, but am very willing to do it. For example, when officers go down to the company to serve as soldiers, I used to be unable to put down my airs, but now I understand that this is a very natural and ordinary thing, and I can't ask for it more. Things like this, my views change year by year, because there is a little more practice each year. I think everyone will have such experience. Now the people's communes have become widespread throughout the country's rural areas, but our self-reform is far from keeping up with the rapidly developing situation of the motherland, and is far from meeting the expectations and requirements of the Party and the people for us. The situation is pressing, and time waits for no one. Let us unite more closely, and under the leadership of the Party and the guidance of the general line, continue to strengthen self-reform, actively contribute our wisdom and strength to the cause of socialism, and use the practical actions of over-fulfilling the 1959 leap forward plan to dedicate ourselves to our great tenth anniversary of the National Day!

### 印度扩张主义者做得太过分了

    印度扩张主义者做得太过分了
    陈明仁委员的发言主席、各位委员：
    我完全同意周总理的报告和两个大会的各项报告。我衷心拥护中央人民政府坚决平息西藏叛乱的各项措施。
    中国人民不是好欺侮的
    西藏是祖国领土的一部分，这是任何人都不能否认的。最近，帝国主义分子和印度的扩张主义分子肚里有鬼，头脑发胀，竟敢明目张胆干涉我国内政，想在西藏的叛乱问题上大做文章，叫嚣什么“西藏独立”，这是我们绝对不能容忍的。背叛祖国劫持达赖喇嘛的西藏反动分子，是中国民族的败类和敌人，他们逃往邻邦印度，我们看到印度扩张主义分子和某些政治活动家不但没有表示公正的态度，反而开门容纳。有些印度的官员还散发敌视中国人民的所谓达赖声明，这难道是遵守五项原则吗？这难道是友好的表示吗？我们非常珍视中印两国的传统友谊，我们始终坚持我们共同提出的五项原则，但是我们绝不能让印度扩张主义分子破坏五项原则，绝不能让印度扩张主义分子利用这种友谊来作为他们干涉中国内政的盾牌。那些干涉者们已经做得太过分了，他们也不量量体重，看看日历，难道现在的中国人是好欺侮的吗？不！现在的中国人是不好欺侮的！干涉者们若不立即悬崖勒马，硬是不识时务蛮干下去的话，中国人民是不会客气的。
    我们都认识达赖喇嘛，他是全国人民代表大会的副委员长。他曾经一再表示拥护中央，维护社会主义祖国的统一，并在被劫持时写给谭冠三将军三封信，这是我们所熟悉的一位真的达赖喇嘛。至于两次发表所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”的“达赖喇嘛”，那是一位使我们很感陌生的人，因为他讲的话不像中国人讲的话，更不像藏族同胞讲的话，听起来倒十分像印度扩张主义分子讲的话。同时，达赖喇嘛怎么能够授权达赖喇嘛写声明和发表声明呢？因此，我们有理由怀疑，发表所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”的那位“达赖喇嘛”是一位假的达赖喇嘛。事实摆得很明显，达赖喇嘛被西藏反动集团劫持，在印度扩张主义分子的直接摆布之下，根本不可能表达他对祖国热爱、对中央拥护的衷心愿望。他目前的声明也好，以后的声明或谈话也好，不管发表多少，只要发出来的声音不是我们听得很熟悉的达赖喇嘛的声音，都不过是干涉者假借名义而已。我们严正警告扩张主义分子：中国人民是不好欺侮的，中国的主权是不容许侵犯的，中国的内政是不容许干涉的。任何企图利用西藏叛乱事件扩张领土野心的卑鄙阴谋，注定要遭到可耻的失败。
    党对起义人员的关怀
    中华人民共和国建国快十周年了。这十年来的变化，特别是去年一年的大跃进，人民公社的伟大创举，真是惊天动地，也令人欢天喜地。我投向人民也快十周年了。十年来的事实证明：党对起义人员的争取、团结、教育、改造的政策是无比伟大和正确的。跟我一道起义的人，现在全部都得到了适当的安排，绝大多数人都有不同程度的进步，对祖国建设事业贡献了一定的力量，有的改造得好的，进步得快的，还光荣加入了中国共产党。回溯十年来的经过，党对起义人员的关怀和教育真是苦口婆心，仁至义尽。我们起义人员虽有一定进步，但我们决不能自满，那种认为改造已经差不多了的想法，是不切合实际的。改造思想，追求进步是每个人自己的事，所以叫做“自我改造”，决不是别人包办得了的。党对起义人员也只能在工作上、生活上进行安排，也只能帮助、教育，从各方面提供促进进步的条件，究竟进不进步，改造得好不好，还得靠自己自觉，自己努力，自己负责，别人是无法代替的，党也是无法包下来的。现在可以肯定，起义人员的多数是有了进步，但进步还很不够，还要在为社会主义服务的实践中，按照毛主席所指示的六项标准，继续加强自我改造。十年来，我个人也有进步，进步也还不够。现在的我和十年前的我，无论在思想认识、工作方法、生活作风、性情脾气等各个方面，可以说改变得不少，我并不是说我已经改造好了，而是说明十年来党对我的教育、培养是无微不至的。我的体会不深，但有一条可以自信，那就是要具体地接受党的领导，越是听党的话，越是向党交心，就越能克服自己的弱点，增长自己的智慧，否则浮光掠影，站脚不稳，进步就很慢了。所以说：“千条万条，党的领导，硬是第一条。”只要你认真地具体地听党的话，经常地向党交心，自我改造就是快些，这中间是来不得一点假的。从旧的立场，转变到新的立场，是一件不容易的事，要经过反复无数次的实践，才能完成这样一个转变。譬如参加体力劳动，我过去认为是低微下贱之事，现在不但不嫌，反而非常乐意去干。又如军官下到连队当兵，过去我就不能放下架子，现在懂得这是一件很自然很普通的事，求之不得。诸如此类，我的看法一年不同一年，因为一年比一年的实践多了一点嘛。我想大家都会有这样体会的。现在全国农村已经普遍人民公社化了，但我们的自我改造，还远远赶不上祖国飞跃发展的形势，还远远不能适应党和人民对我们的期望和要求。形势逼人，时不我与。让我们更加紧密地团结起来，在党的领导和总路线的指引下，继续加强自我改造，积极为社会主义事业贡献自己的智慧和力量，用超额完成一九五九年跃进计划的实际行动，来向我们伟大的国庆十周年献礼吧！
