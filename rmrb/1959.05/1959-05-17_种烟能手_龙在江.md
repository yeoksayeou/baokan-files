    Tobacco Growing Expert - Long Zaijiang
    By Our Correspondent Liu Yangshen
    Long Zaijiang has been growing flue-cured tobacco since he was seventeen, and now it has been eighteen years. Whether he cultivates it himself, or guides others to cultivate it, the tobacco leaves grow abundantly and well, resulting in bumper harvests year after year. Last year, the Xinpu production team he led had an average yield of 457 jin per mu of flue-cured tobacco, more than double that of 1957.
    Is it because the fields he cultivates tobacco in are particularly good? Not at all. Anyone who has been to Xinpu Township in Guiding County, Guizhou, will find that it was originally a hillside, with high and cold terrain and barren soil. However, since liberation, this place has been one of the most famous high-yield flue-cured tobacco areas in the southwest provinces of China.
    In Xinpu, even children as young as seven or eight can tell you stories about Long Zaijiang. People say that as long as he goes there to take a look, he can determine whether the land is suitable for growing tobacco; they say that the tobacco leaves he grows are not dared to be invaded by pests and germs...
    This reporter recently interviewed this tobacco growing expert. He was transplanting tobacco seedlings together with the masses, skillfully transplanting the tobacco seedlings into the ground, and demonstrating to some new members learning to grow tobacco leaves. During the rest time, Long Zaijiang introduced some of his main experiences in tobacco cultivation. He said: "In fact, my planting experience is nothing more than what has already been summarized in the 'Eight-Point Charter' for agriculture, except that I have concretized them. Take close planting as an example. In the past, flue-cured tobacco here was always planted sparsely in large nests, with only a thousand or two thousand nests per mu at most. Since the success of close planting of rice here, I thought: close planting of rice can harvest more grain, can't close planting of tobacco also harvest more tobacco leaves? At that time, I talked to some old farmers about this issue, but they didn't believe it, thinking that this would reduce the quality. However, in the autumn of 1957, I discovered that the tobacco field of a production team had 2,700 plants per mu, which was about 500 more plants than usual; as a result, the harvested tobacco leaves not only had a higher yield than usual, but also the quality of the cured tobacco was very good."
    It was under the inspiration of this fact that Long Zaijiang and the members jointly researched a method for reasonable close planting of tobacco, and introduced it at the provincial flue-cured tobacco on-site conference held in Guiding last spring. Last year, the tobacco leaf production in Guizhou Province increased by more than double, which is inseparable from the promotion of reasonable close planting. This year, the Xinpu production team plans to continue to adopt the yield-increasing measure of close planting.
    "However, I don't advocate unconditional close planting." Long Zaijiang believes that in order to achieve high yields of tobacco leaves, not only must there be a large number of plants, but also each plant must have more leaves, and grow longer and larger, thicker, and with more oil content. If the conditions are ignored and the planting is too dense, although the number of plants increases, the ventilation and light transmission are not good, coupled with the inconvenience of management, the total yield and quality of the tobacco will definitely not be improved.
    Although the farmers in Xinpu have decades of experience in growing tobacco, they have long believed that "fertile soil cannot be used to grow tobacco," saying that "the tobacco leaves grown on fertile soil cannot be cured yellow." Therefore, no base fertilizer was applied in the tobacco fields in the past. In the spring of 1952, he conducted experiments on applying base fertilizer in tobacco fields, and the results proved that this can directly promote the growth of seedlings and the development of roots, and also improve the soil. It was in this year that he created a new record of an average yield of 373 jin per mu, and was elected as a model of flue-cured tobacco production in the southwest region. Since then, the experience of applying base fertilizer in tobacco fields has also spread throughout Guizhou Province.
    Tobacco farmers are often troubled by a tobacco seedling disease that has always been difficult to prevent, which is root rot. When the tobacco seedlings grow to more than two feet tall, the roots often become diseased and rotten, leading to death. In the past, when encountering this situation, they had to reluctantly pull out the tobacco seedlings and burn or bury them deeply to avoid spreading. Long Zaijiang also had this painful experience. He was determined to study ways to prevent and control this disease. After his continuous investigation and research, he finally found two prevention and control methods: one is to deeply turn the land, plowing about a foot deep; the other is to implement the "imported soil method" for tobacco plants that have just developed root rot symptoms—digging out the old soil around the roots of the tobacco plants, replacing it with soil from other places, and mounding the roots well. In this way, root rot can be prevented and controlled simply and effectively. Due to Long Zaijiang's great achievements in cultivating tobacco leaves, he has been invited to various places to teach techniques many times. Recently, he was also invited to teach at the Guizhou Agricultural College.

    种烟能手——龙在江
    本报记者　刘扬深
    龙在江从十七岁种烤烟，到现在已经十八年了。不管是他自己栽种的，还是别人在他指导下栽种的，烟叶都长得又多又好，连年丰收。去年他领导的新铺生产队，两千亩烤烟平均亩产四百五十七斤，比1957年提高了一倍多。
    是不是他栽培烤烟的田地特别好呢？完全不是。到贵州贵定县新铺乡去过的人，都会发现那里原是一个山坡，地势高寒，土壤瘠瘦。但是，这个地方解放以后，一直是我国西南各省最著名的烤烟高产区之一。
    在新铺，一提到龙在江，连七、八岁的小孩也都能告诉你一些故事。人们说，只要他到那里看一看，就可以断定这块土地适不适合种烟；说他种的烟叶，害虫和病菌都不敢侵犯……。
    记者最近访问了这位种烟能手。他正同群众一道移栽烟苗，一边熟练地把一株株烟苗移栽到地里，一边给一些新学种烟叶的社员示范。利用休息时间，龙在江介绍了他在栽培烤烟上的一些主要经验。他说：“实际上，我的种植经验也不外农业‘八字宪法’里已经总结了的那些，只不过是我把它们具体化了。就拿密植来说吧。过去这里烤烟一贯是种稀大窝，一亩地种个千把两千窝就了不起。自从水稻密植在这里见了成效以后，我就想：水稻密植能多收谷子，烤烟密植难道就不能多收烟叶？当时我向一些老农谈这个问题，他们不相信，认为这样做会降低质量。可是，我在1957年秋天，发现有一个生产小队的烟地，每亩种二千七百株，比一般的要多种五百来株；结果，收的烟叶不仅产量比一般高，烤出的烟质量也很好。”
    正是在这个事实的启示下，龙在江和社员共同研究出了烤烟合理密植的办法，并且在去年春天在贵定召开的全省烤烟现场会议上作了介绍。去年贵州省烟叶增产一倍以上，是同推广合理密植分不开的。今年新铺生产队准备继续采取密植这项增产措施。
    “但是，我又不赞成无条件的密植。”龙在江认为，要想烟叶高产，不仅要株数多，还要使每一株的叶片长得多，长得又长又大，长得厚实、油分大。如果不顾条件，种得过密，尽管株数多了，可是通风透光不好，加上管理不便，烟的总产量和质量肯定是提不高的。
    新铺农民虽然有几十年的种烟经验，却长期以来认为“肥土不能种烟”，说“在肥土上种的烟叶烤不黄”。因此，当地过去在烟地里不施底肥。1952年春，他在烟地施底肥进行试验，结果证明，这样做既能直接促进幼苗的生长和根系的发育，又能改良土壤。就是在这一年，他创造了平均亩产三百七十三斤的新纪录，当选为西南地区烤烟生产模范。从此，烟地施底肥的经验也在全贵州省传开了。
    种烟的农民们常为一种历来很难防治的烟苗病害所苦恼，就是根腐病。当烟苗长到两尺多高的时候，往往根部发病腐烂，以至死亡。过去碰到这种情况，只好忍心把烟苗拔去烧掉或深埋，以免蔓延。龙在江也有过这种痛心的经历。他下决心研究防治这种病害的办法。经过他的不断调查研究，终于找到了两种防治办法：一种是深翻土地，犁一尺深左右；另一种是对初发生根腐病症状的烟株，实行
  “客土法”——把烟株根部四周的老土挖去，换上别处的泥土，把根部壅好。这样，根腐病就简便有效地被防治了。由于龙在江在培植烟叶上作出了巨大成绩，他曾多次被邀请到各地去传授技术。最近，他又应聘到贵州农学院讲学。
