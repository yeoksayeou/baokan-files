    Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 30th: The People's Liberation Army rebel-suppressing troops released ninety-six prisoners on the afternoon of the 29th. The released prisoners were each carrying a release certificate issued by the Tibet Military Region and returned to their respective hometowns or temples. Including the previous batches of prisoners released successively, a total of five hundred and fifteen war prisoners captured in the Lhasa rebellion have been granted lenient release.
    Among the released prisoners were former Tibetan army company commanders, platoon leaders, instructors, lamas from rebellious monasteries, and Tibetan civilians who had been coerced into joining the rebellion. After receiving education in the prisoner-of-war camp, they showed signs of admitting their guilt and repenting, and therefore, received lenient treatment from the PLA rebel-suppressing troops. At the time of release, the Tibet Military Region gave each person thirty catties of qingke barley, as well as daily necessities such as towels, soap, and cigarettes. Those who lived far from home were also given travel expenses.
    Many of the released prisoners shed tears of emotion before leaving the prisoner-of-war camp, and expressed that they would abide by the policies and decrees of the Military Control Commission and the People's Government after returning home, work hard in production, and turn over a new leaf.

    Xinhua News Agency, Lhasa, 29th: Our correspondent Zong Zidu reports: The rare editions of Buddhist scriptures and manuscripts of the Dalai Lama collected in Lhasa's temples are now intact thanks to the protection and management of the People's Liberation Army. This was recently told to reporters by living Buddhas and Khenpos from famous temples in Lhasa, as well as attendants of the Dalai Lama in the Norbulingka.
    The "Pattra-leaf Sutras" are the oldest and most precious scriptures in Tibet, written in gold or ink on Bodhi tree leaves. They are ancient, dry, and fragile. These "Pattra-leaf Sutras" are preserved in Gongdelin (one of the famous temples in Lhasa) and have not suffered any damage.
    The "Kangyur" (Tripitaka) written by Sakyamuni and the "Tengyur" (Commentaries) written by later Buddhist scholars to annotate this scripture are also the most valuable scriptures in Tibet. The former has one hundred and eight cases (volumes) and the latter has more than two hundred cases, all of which are preserved in the three major monasteries of Lhasa (Drepung, Sera, and Ganden) and other temples. The handwritten copies of the "Kangyur" and "Tengyur" treasured in Drepung Monastery, the complete set of "gSer Sdong bZang sPyod" (Collected Works of Tsongkhapa, the founder of the Yellow Sect, and his disciples), and the "Yig Cha" (reference books) written by each Zhacang on "Tshad Nyid Bla Ma" (classics for studying debate) have not suffered any damage.
    Many woodcut scripture boards stored in "Xueba Kang" (famous printing house in front of the Potala Palace) at the foot of the Potala Palace are intact. Among them are the biographies and collections of Tsongkhapa and the Dalai Lamas of past generations, as well as the original woodcut boards of books on Tibetan history, literature, philology, and linguistics.
    The "Men Xiong" (medical books) and the secret books on astronomy, astrology, and calendar of the "Mentseekhang" (Medical and Astrological Institute) on Yaowang Mountain are well preserved.
    The Dalai Lama's manuscripts, including his study notes, notes of excerpts from scriptures, outlines for lectures, poems written in 1956 and 1957, prayer poems and prayers written for the printing of scriptures in various Tibetan monasteries, summaries of his daily notes, and drafts of his correspondence with the Panchen Erdeni, have all been properly preserved. The manuscripts preserved in the Dalai Lama's summer palace in Norbulingka are partly wrapped in red satin and partly placed in leather boxes, all stored in bookshelves. The keys to the bookshelves are kept by the Dalai Lama's attendants, and the locks are sealed with sealing wax over yellow cloth strips. (Attached picture)

    平叛大军释放五百多名俘虏
    人民解放军妥善保护文物古迹
    拉萨各寺庙佛经珍本完整无缺
    新华社拉萨30日电　中国人民解放军平叛部队在29日下午，释放了九十六名俘虏，被释放的俘虏都带着西藏军区发给的释放证，返回各自的家乡或寺庙。连同以前陆续释放的几批俘虏在内，在拉萨地区叛乱中俘获的战俘已有五百一十五名获得宽大释放。
    在被释放的俘虏中，有原藏军的连长、排长、教官、叛乱寺庙的喇嘛和被裹胁参加叛乱的藏民。他们在俘虏营里经过教育，有了认罪悔过的表现，因而，受到解放军平叛部队的宽大处理。释放时，西藏军区给每人发了三十斤青稞和毛巾、肥皂、香烟等日用品，离家远的还发了路费。
    许多被释放的俘虏在离开俘虏营前，都激动得流出了眼泪，并表示回家后一定遵守军管会和人民政府的政策法令，努力生产，重新做人。
    新华社拉萨29日电　本社记者宗子度报道：拉萨寺庙收藏的佛经珍本和达赖喇嘛的手稿，由于人民解放军的保护和管理，现在都完整无缺，这是拉萨著名寺庙的活佛、堪布和达赖喇嘛在罗布林卡的侍卫官等最近告诉记者的。
    “贝叶经”是西藏最古老、最珍贵的经典，它是用金汁或墨汁在菩提树叶上写成的，年代久远，干燥易碎。这些“贝叶经”保存在功德林（拉萨著名的寺院之一）中，丝毫没有受到损失。
    释迦牟尼所著的“甘珠尔”（大藏经）和后世佛学者为注释这部经典而写的“敦珠尔”（论藏），也是西藏最宝贵的经典，前者有一百零八函（本），后者有二百多函，都照数保存在拉萨三大寺（哲蚌、色拉、噶丹）和其他各寺庙里。哲蚌寺珍藏的“甘珠尔”和“敦珠尔”的手抄本，整套的“尧瑟松崩”（黄教始祖宗喀巴和他的弟子们的文集）以及各个扎仓对“扯尼白卡”（研究辩论的经典）所写的译卡（参考书），都没有受到损失。
    存放在布达拉宫下面“雪巴康”（前藏著名的印经院）中的许多木刻经板完整无缺。其中有宗喀巴和历世达赖喇嘛的传记、文集，以及西藏的历史、文学、文字学和语言学等书籍的木刻原板。
    药王山的“门雄”（医书）和“门孜康”（医算局）秘传的天文、星算、历法等书籍都保存得很好。
    达赖喇嘛的手稿，其中包括他学经的笔记，从经典上摘采原句的札记，讲经的提纲，1956年和1957年写的诗稿以及为西藏各寺院刻印经书所写的祈祷诗、祈祷文，他的日常记事摘要，以及和班禅额尔德尼通信的底稿等，都被妥善地保存着。保存在罗布林卡达赖喇嘛夏宫里的手稿，一部分用红缎包着，一部分放在皮匣里，全部存放在书橱中。书橱的钥匙由达赖喇嘛的侍卫官保管，锁上面的黄布条加盖有火漆封印。（附图片）
