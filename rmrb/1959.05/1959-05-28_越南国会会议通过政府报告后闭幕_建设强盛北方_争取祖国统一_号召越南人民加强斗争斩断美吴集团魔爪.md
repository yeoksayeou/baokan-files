Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, May 27th: The Tenth Session of the National Assembly of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam successfully closed at 6:00 PM today.

    President Ho Chi Minh, Deputy Prime Ministers Truong Chinh, Vo Nguyen Giap, and ministers of various government departments attended today's afternoon session. Foreign envoys to Vietnam were also invited to attend the meeting.

    At today's afternoon meeting, Prime Minister Pham Van Dong delivered a speech on behalf of the government. He said that the various departments of the government have achieved many successes in their work in the past year. At present, the socialist construction cause in North Vietnam is developing rapidly. He pointed out that all of this proves that under the leadership of the Vietnam Workers' Party and President Ho Chi Minh, the direction and line of socialist construction in North Vietnam is completely correct. Under the guidance of this correct direction and line, we firmly believe that our cause will surely achieve even more brilliant achievements in the future.

    Pham Van Dong pointed out that the achievements made in the past year are the result of the hard work of the Vietnamese people and are inseparable from the selfless assistance of the Soviet Union, China, and other fraternal countries. He said that we must further exert the strength of all the people and use favorable objective conditions to build a strong socialist North and lay a solid foundation for the struggle for peaceful reunification of the country.

    Pham Van Dong pointed out that while we must rapidly develop our construction cause, we must also strengthen and consolidate our national defense, resolutely suppress counter-revolutionary sabotage activities, and defend the fruits of the revolution.

    Pham Van Dong expressed his acceptance of the opinions raised by the National Assembly representatives on the various tasks of the government. He said that these opinions will help the various departments of the government to further improve their work.

    This afternoon, many representatives spoke out to strongly condemn the South Vietnamese authorities for their cruel persecution of patriotic people under the instigation of US imperialism. They unanimously demanded that the International Commission immediately stop the increasingly serious attempts by the South Vietnamese authorities to undermine the Geneva Accords and their conspiracy to divide Vietnam permanently.

    The meeting unanimously adopted the statement of the Vietnam National Assembly on the situation in South Vietnam amidst warm applause.

    Subsequently, all the representatives passed resolutions on the government's reports on "Agricultural Cooperativization," "The 1959 National Plan," and "The 1958 National Financial Statement and the 1959 National Budget," expressing their complete agreement with the aforementioned reports of the government. All representatives also unanimously passed a resolution instructing the government to further study and revise the draft of the "Marriage and Family Law" and then submit it to the broad masses of the people for discussion, and suggested that it be put to a vote at the next session of the National Assembly.

    Finally, Ton Duc Thang, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National Assembly, delivered a closing speech amidst warm applause. He announced that the Tenth Session of the National Assembly had achieved complete success. The National Assembly and the government have reached complete agreement on the issues discussed.

    Ton Duc Thang said that the great achievements of this meeting will surely encourage the Vietnamese people to move from victory to greater victory in the cause of building North Vietnam and unifying the country.

    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, May 27th: After several days of group and plenary discussions, the Tenth Session of the National Assembly of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam today unanimously passed the "Resolution on Agricultural Cooperativization."

    The resolution said, "The National Assembly unanimously believes that the cooperativization movement is currently developing vigorously and has become a mass movement. The movement is proceeding basically well."

    The resolution said, "The National Assembly unanimously believes that agricultural cooperativization is the central link in the current socialist transformation and socialist construction of North Vietnam." The resolution also said, "In mountainous areas, the agricultural cooperativization movement should be combined with the development of production and the completion of democratic reforms."

    The resolution said, "The National Assembly unanimously approves the basic provisions on the goals, requirements, class line, principles, specific policies, and methods of agricultural cooperativization proposed in the government report."

    The resolution said that the National Assembly instructs the government to strengthen its leadership over the agricultural cooperativization movement and requires the various departments of the government to study the specific policies of their respective departments and take all necessary measures to serve the development of the agricultural cooperativization movement in a timely manner.

    Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, May 27th: The Tenth Session of the National Assembly of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam passed a statement on the situation in South Vietnam before closing this afternoon.

    The statement strongly condemns the United States and its running dog, the Ngo Dinh Diem authorities, for creating the Phu Loi incident, promulgating Ordinance No. 10 of 1959, mobilizing regular troops for large-scale sweeps, and intensifying the large-scale massacre of the South Vietnamese people.

    The statement calls on the South Vietnamese people to further unite and persist in the struggle against US interference in South Vietnam and its policy of preparing for war, against the South Vietnamese authorities' reliance on the United States, against suppression and massacres, and to demand the peaceful reunification of the country.

    The statement calls on patriots and people with conscience in the South Vietnamese political institutions and army to not serve the US imperialists' policy of aggression and Ngo Dinh Diem's policy of betraying the country, and to not serve their policy of suppressing and massacring the people.

    The statement calls on the North Vietnamese people to accelerate the construction of North Vietnam as a backing for the reunification of the country.

    The statement expresses its belief that under the heroic struggle of the Vietnamese people and with the sympathy and support of the people of the world, the Vietnamese people will surely be able to sever the bloody claws of the American-Ngo group.
