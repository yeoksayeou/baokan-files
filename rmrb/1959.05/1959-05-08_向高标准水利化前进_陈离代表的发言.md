　　Advancing Towards High-Standard Water Conservancy
    Speech by Representative Chen Li

    Chairman, esteemed representatives:

    I fully endorse the Government Work Report made by Premier Zhou Enlai and the reports made by Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen.

    The glorious and brilliant year of 1958 was a year of all-round great leap forward in China's economic and cultural construction. Under the wise leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the people of the whole country achieved tremendous victories in industry, agriculture, cultural education, and other construction undertakings. I was transferred from the Southwest to Hubei Province and have been working in the water conservancy construction department. Now I will briefly report to the representatives on the water conservancy construction situation in Hubei Province during the Great Leap Forward:

    In 1959, the water conservancy construction in Hubei Province has further developed on the basis of the great leap forward in 1958. It is being carried out according to the policy put forward at the Provincial Water Conservancy Conference last April, which called for a shift from local development to river basin management, from single utilization to comprehensive utilization, and from low guarantee rates to high guarantee rates. The Danjiangkou Water Conservancy Hub on the Han River, the Puchi and Guijiafan Hubs on the Lishui River, the Hujiadu Hub on the Nan River, the Guanyinsi and Jigongjian Hubs on the Ju and Zhang Rivers, the Yangxinzhen Hub on the Fushui River, and the Bailianhe Hub on the Xishui River are all the first-phase projects for comprehensive management of the respective river basins. The six major reservoirs for comprehensive management of the Fu River, except for the Heiwuwan Reservoir, which was completed last spring, the Huantan, Fengjiangkou, Xianjuemiao, Xujiahe, and Yandian reservoirs have all started construction. Other smaller rivers, such as the Gun River, Wudu River, Weisui River, Daoshui River, Jushui River, and Qishui River, have all started construction on a comprehensive management project selected in the river basin plan. There are a total of thirty-eight such reservoirs, all of which are comprehensive utilization projects for flood control, irrigation, power generation, navigation, and aquaculture. The Danjiangkou Hub is the main project for near-term development in the Han River basin plan and is also one of the large-scale projects under construction in the country. The amount of engineering is even greater than the Sanmenxia project. After completion, it can basically eliminate the frequent and serious flood disasters affecting about five million people and 9.5 million mu of farmland within 17,000 square kilometers in the middle and lower reaches of the Han River. It can irrigate 14 million mu of farmland in the Tangbai River area, and its installed capacity of 900,000 kilowatts can solve the urgent power needs of the Central China region. Under the personal direction of Governor Zhang Tixue, the hub is currently under intense construction. The first-phase cofferdam and dam foundation clearing work have been fully completed, and the concrete for the dam body is being poured. The first phase of the project is basically done using "indigenous" methods, creating a precedent for the use of indigenous methods in the construction of large-scale hubs. Under the guidance of the policy of "starting with indigenous methods, prioritizing indigenous methods before adopting foreign ones, and combining indigenous and foreign methods," the project will be basically completed in two to three years, and the project progress is very fast (the construction period for such hubs generally takes more than five years in the world). The Puchi Hub on the Lishui River is an experimental hub. In order to verify a series of technical problems in the design, construction, and power station operation of the Three Gorges Hub in practice, it was approved by the Central Government for construction. The hub has an installed capacity of 40,000 kilowatts and irrigates about one million mu of farmland. The dam is 47 meters high and is the largest experimental project in the world. It is currently under intense construction and is expected to be completed next year, which will provide conditions for making good technical preparations for the Three Gorges project. The remaining hubs such as Hujiadu are also very large in scale, with tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of people regularly working on each construction site, and they can all be completed before the big flood this year or by the end of the year. There are more than 194,000 small and medium-sized water conservancy projects that have started construction in the province, and they have now been basically completed. These achievements fully demonstrate the miracles created by the soaring enthusiasm and infinite wisdom of the working people of our country.

    In conjunction with the networking of rivers and lakes in the plains, Hubei Province has also built many culverts and sluice gates to divert water from the Yangtze River and Han River for irrigation this year. The Zekou Gate, which has already started construction, can irrigate more than 2 million mu of the Jianghan Plain, and the water diversion canal is also combined with navigation and power generation.

    The people's communes in the plain lake areas are particularly enthusiastic about river networking. River networking only started in Hubei last winter, and now each county has created several typical examples of rural landscape. Due to the incomplete construction of large canals and the limited availability of materials for canal system structures, the river networking movement has not yet been widely carried out.

    Hubei plans to increase water diversion and storage by 12 billion cubic meters this year, which is 20 percent more than the total amount of water diverted and stored by all existing farmland water conservancy projects. The irrigated area will be increased by 10 million mu, and some of the already irrigated cultivated land is undergoing "five additions" to the canal system. The so-called "five additions" are to lengthen, widen, deepen, reinforce the canals, and add reservoirs and ponds along the canals. The purpose is to increase water diversion and storage, expand the irrigated area, and increase the irrigation guarantee rate. Adding reservoirs to the canal system and linking them with existing ponds and weirs has a very significant effect on expanding and improving efficiency. The Nan-Yi (Nanzhang and Yicheng counties) hundred-mile-long canal diverts water from the Man River. The original design was to irrigate the fields directly through the canal (through branch canals, bucket canals, and capillary canals), which could only irrigate 100,500 mu. In dry years in summer and autumn, when the river flow is relatively low, it is still not possible to guarantee a bumper harvest. In recent years, the canal system has been changed to a "watermelon vine" type (i.e., long vine bearing melons) and combined with more than 1,000 ponds and weirs in the irrigated area, and some reservoirs have been added. The largest, the Yicheng Liyuqiao Reservoir, has a storage capacity of more than 20 million cubic meters. Last year, which was a dry year, it irrigated 280,000 mu and generated 80 kilowatts of electricity for lighting and grain processing in Yicheng County, and the water was still not used up. This year, it is planned to expand the irrigated area to 400,000 mu. The original canals have not been enlarged, and the structures have not been改造. Only the main and branch canals have been extended, and a batch of canal system structures have been newly built. This experience is worth introducing.

    In Hubei, the long vine bearing melon canal system was first created in Changqu. Last year, Zhao Gang Township in Guanghua County, Xiangyang Prefecture, used this canal system to solve the problem of irrigating more than 10,000 mu of paddy fields with 0.06 flows of the Ducao River. After Comrade Zhao Xiu, First Secretary of the Xiangyang Prefectural Committee, summarized and promoted it, this type of canal system played a great role in Hubei Province's bumper harvest last year. The Zhanghe Reservoir irrigation system of 4 million mu, which is currently under construction, is designed according to this model. This new type of canal system not only makes full use of the runoff of 4,000 square kilometers in the irrigated area, so that the 800 million cubic meters of effective water in the reservoir can ensure sufficient water for 4 million mu of paddy fields, but also installs generators of more than 12,000 kilowatts to ensure year-round navigation of 250 kilometers of canals and expands the area for fish farming. A large amount of earthwork and stonework in the canal system is also saved. This is an important achievement in the design technology of irrigation canal systems.

    Since Hubei Province has sufficient rainfall, as long as it makes full use of surface runoff, and solves the contradiction between irrigation and power generation and navigation, the high standard of storing, diverting, and irrigating 800 to 1,000 cubic meters of water per mu of paddy field and 300 to 500 cubic meters per mu of dry land can be achieved. Ninety-five percent of the cultivated land can be irrigated, of which 80 percent can be irrigated by gravity flow. The desire to use low-cost hydropower to electrify rural areas and to basically network the plains and hilly areas with waterways can also be achieved. The broad masses of farmers in Hubei, on the basis of communization and under the leadership of the Party committees at all levels, are striding forward towards this high-standard water conservancy goal.

    While the people of the whole country are going all out to strive for a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in 1959, the reactionary upper strata of Tibet, under the instigation of imperialism and foreign reactionaries, openly launched an armed rebellion, betrayed the motherland, and undermined unity. This heinous crime aroused unparalleled indignation among the Tibetan monks and laity and the people of the whole country. The People's Liberation Army troops stationed in Tibet were ordered to quickly quell the rebellion. The Tibetan reactionaries kidnapped the Dalai Lama and fled to India. Indian diplomatic officials even distributed a so-called "Dalai Lama statement." This statement is full of lies and is absurd. Indian interventionists have shown particular "warmth" and "sympathy" for the traitors since the Tibetan rebellion occurred, and their failure is like a bereavement for their parents. These facts fully demonstrate that they are colluding with each other and attempting to inherit the mantle of British imperialism. I want to solemnly warn these people in India that the power of the 650 million Chinese people who have stood up is unparalleled. Any conspiracy to interfere in our internal affairs or to covet Chinese territory is intolerable to us. We hope that Indian politicians will prioritize the friendship between the Chinese and Indian people, immediately rein in their horses before it's too late, and stop all shameful attempts to interfere in China's internal affairs.

### 向高标准水利化前进  陈离代表的发言

　　向高标准水利化前进
    陈离代表的发言主席、各位代表：
    我完全拥护周恩来总理所作的政府工作报告和李富春、李先念副总理、彭真副委员长所作的报告。
    光辉灿烂的一九五八年，是我国经济及文化建设全面大跃进的一年，全国人民在共产党和毛主席的英明领导下，在工业、农业、文化教育和其他各项建设事业上都取得了巨大的胜利。我从西南调到湖北省来，都是在水利建设部门工作，现在我简单的将湖北省在大跃进中的水利建设情况向各位代表汇报一下：
    一九五九年湖北省的水利建设，在一九五八年大跃进的基础上有进一步的发展。它是根据去年四月全省水利会议所提出的由局部开发转向流域治理，由单一利用转向综合利用，由低保证率转向高保证率的方针进行的。汉江的丹江口水利枢纽，陆水的蒲圻、桂家畈枢纽，南河的胡家渡枢纽，沮漳河的观音寺，鸡公尖枢纽，富水的阳辛镇枢纽，浠水的白莲河枢纽，都是各河流域治本的第一期工程。府河治本的六大水库，除黑屋湾水库已经在去春完成之外，环潭，封江口，先觉庙，徐家河，宴店五个水库都开了工。其他较小河流，如滚河，雾渡河，洈水，倒水，举水，圻水等，都在流域规划中选择了一个治本工程开了工，这样的水库，共有三十八处，都是防洪，灌溉，发电，航运，水产综合利用工程。丹江口枢纽，是汉江流域规划中近期开发的主要工程，也是全国正在建设的大型工程之一，工程数量比三门峡还大，建成后可以基本上解除汉江中下游地区一万七千平方公里内约五百万人，九百五十万亩耕地频繁而又严重的洪水灾害，可灌溉唐白河地区一千四百万亩农田，装机九十万瓩，可以解决华中地区迫切的需电问题。该枢纽在张体学省长亲自主持下，目前正在紧张施工，第一期围堰和大坝清基工作已全部完成，正在浇筑坝体的砼。该工程的第一期工程，基本上是用“土”办法做的，创造了大型枢纽采用土法施工的先例。该工程将在“土法上马，先土后洋，土洋结合”的方针指导下，在二至三年内基本建成，工程进度是很快的（世界上一般像这样的枢纽施工期限都在五年以上）。陆水的蒲圻枢纽，是一个试验枢纽，为了使解决三峡枢纽设计、施工和电站运行中的一系列技术问题，得到实践的验证，经中央批准兴建的。该枢纽装机容量达四万瓩，灌溉农田约一百万亩，坝高四十七公尺是世界上最大的试验工程，现在正在紧张施工，预计明年可以全部建成，将为作好三峡技术准备提供条件。其余的胡家渡等枢纽，规模亦很宏大，各工地经常有几万人，十几万人施工，都能在今年大汛前或年底前完成。全省已开工的中小型水利工程，共有十九万四千多处，现在已基本上完成。这些成就，充分说明了我国劳动人民的冲天干劲和无穷智慧所创造出来的奇迹。
    结合着平原河网化，湖北省今年也做了不少的从长江、汉水引水灌溉的涵闸，已经开工的泽口闸可灌江汉平原二百多万亩，引水渠也结合着航运和发电。
    平原湖区的人民公社对河网化的劲头特别大。河网化在湖北是去年冬季才开始的，现在各县都做出了几处田园化的典型。由于大干渠没有完成，渠系建筑物材料受了限制，河网化运动还没有普遍开展。
    湖北今年计划增加引蓄水量一百二十亿公方，比原有全部农田水利工程引蓄水量的总和还多百分之二十。增加灌溉面积一千万亩，已有灌溉的耕地有些正在进行渠系“五加”工作。所谓“五加”是渠道加长、加宽、加深、加固、加沿渠蓄水库和塘堰。目的在增加引水和蓄水量，扩大灌溉面积，提高灌溉保证率。渠系增加蓄水库，并与原有塘堰联系起来，对扩大、提高效益作用非常显著。南宜（南漳、宜城两县）百里长渠从蛮河引水，原设计由渠道直接灌田（通过支渠、斗渠、毛渠），只能灌十万零五千亩，在夏秋干旱、河水流量较枯的年份还不能保证丰收。近几年把渠系改成“西瓜秧”式（即长藤结瓜式）与灌区的一千多口塘堰结合起来，并增加了一些水库，最大的宜城鲤鱼桥水库蓄水二千多万公方，去年是干旱年，已灌了二十八万亩，发电八十瓩供宜城县城照明和粮食加工，水还用不完，今年拟扩大灌溉面积到四十万亩。原有渠道并没有加大，建筑物并没有改造，只是延长了干支渠，新建了一批渠系建筑物。这个经验是值得介绍的。
    在湖北，长藤结瓜式渠系是由长渠首创的，去年襄阳专区光化县赵岗乡用这种渠系解决了杜槽河零点零六个流量灌溉一万多亩水田的问题。经襄阳地委第一书记赵修同志总结推广以后，这种渠系在湖北省去年丰收上起了很大的作用。目前正在施工的漳河水库灌溉四百万亩的大渠系就是按照这个型式设计的。这个新型渠系不仅尽量利用了灌区四千平方公里的径流，使八亿公方有效水量的水库能够保证四百万亩水田的充分用水外，还装发电机一万二千多瓩，保证二百五十公里渠道长年通航，扩大了养鱼面积。渠系土石方工程还有大量节省。这是灌溉渠系设计技术上的一个重要成就。
    由于湖北省有充分的雨量，只要尽量利用地表径流，解决灌溉与发电、航运的矛盾，每亩水田蓄引灌溉水八百到一千公方，每亩旱地三百至五百公方的高标准是可以达到的；百分之九十五的耕地得到灌溉，其中百分之八十的耕地自流灌溉也是可以做到的；利用低成本的水力发电使农村电气化的愿望，使平原区和丘陵区基本上航运网化的愿望也是可以达到的。湖北的广大农民在公社化的基础上，在各级党委的领导下，正在向这个高标准水利化的目标大踏步前进。
    当全国人民正鼓足冲天干劲为一九五九年更大更好更全面的跃进而奋斗的时候，西藏上层反动集团在帝国主义和外国反动派的指使下，公开发动武装叛乱，背叛祖国，破坏统一，这一滔天罪行，引起西藏僧俗人民和全国人民无比的愤慨，经我人民解放军驻西藏部队奉命迅速平乱，西藏反动集团劫持达赖喇嘛逃入印度。印度外交官员竟散发了一个所谓“达赖喇嘛声明”。这个声明谎话连篇，荒谬绝伦。印度干涉者在西藏叛乱发生以后，对叛徒们表现特别“热心”和“同情”，对他们的失败，如丧考妣一般，这些事实，充分说明他们狼狈为奸，妄图承继英帝国主义的衣钵。我要严正的警告印度的这些人，站起来了的六亿五千万中国人民力量是无比强大的，任何妄想干涉我国内政，妄想染指中国领土的阴谋，都是我们所不能容忍的。我们希望印度的政治家们：以中印人民的友谊为重，立即悬崖勒马，停止一切干涉中国内政的可耻企图。
