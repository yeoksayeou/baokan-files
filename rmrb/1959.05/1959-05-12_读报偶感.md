    Occasional Thoughts on Reading the Newspaper

    "American horror films have taken over Japan's television world, and are a direct cause of today's world of terror in Japan," and so on (according to Asahi Weekly).

    Horror films, for the people of all countries, are a mental devastation and poisoning;
    Horror films, for the imperialists, are also a true portrayal of life: shooting, homicide, murder, killing like flies—precisely the true expression of their cruel class nature. Those who poison the minds of others also open their own minds:
    Look! Everyone, take a look, what a bunch of flies and mosquitoes, beasts in human clothing!

    Associated Press news: A man named Spiller Thomas, who was not insane, was locked up in a mental hospital for fifteen years.

    Commentators say: Those locked up in American mental hospitals are not necessarily "insane"; they are mostly locked up by the insane.

    The British "Daily Sketch" has a large headline: "Eight Murders in Eight Days."

    Why are there so many murders? An "authoritative" British crime reporter replied: "We are too lenient."

    In fact? The leniency of the robber baron towards robbers is just leniency towards himself, no, it's almost a self-appreciation, a self-intoxication!

    “美国的恐怖影片，霸占了日本电视世界，它是造成今日日本恐怖世界的直接因素”云云（朝日周刊载）。
    恐怖电影对各国人民来说，是心灵的摧残和毒害；
    恐怖电影对帝国主义者来说，也是一种生活的写真：枪杀、凶杀、谋杀、杀人如麻，正是他们残忍的阶级本性之真情流露。去毒害别人的心灵的人，也敞开了自己的心灵：
    喏！大家看看，这是怎么样的一群苍蝇蚊子、衣冠禽兽！

    美联社消息：一个名叫史辟勒·汤玛斯的人，本来并不疯，却被关在疯人院里达十五年。
    论者曰：关在美国疯人院的未必就是“疯”人，他们多半是被疯人关进去的。

    英国“每日素描报”的大字标题：“八天八宗谋杀”。
    谋杀为何如此之多？一位“权威的”英国罪案记者答：“我们太宽大了。”
    其实呢？强盗头子对强盗的宽大，不过是对自己的宽大，不，简直有点儿自我欣赏，自我陶醉哩！
