    Ensuring Cotton Seedlings Successfully Clear the Seedling Stage
    Zhang Qiuxiang

    The period from when cotton emerges from the soil to the entire seedling growth stage is the time when it is most susceptible to natural disasters, like a one-month-old baby, who cannot be neglected even for a moment. This period also has many pests and diseases, and other changes are significant. Getting through this stage well is a crucial point for increasing cotton production.

    Whether cotton seedlings can grow well depends on the environment. Cotton likes warmth and cannot tolerate cold; this is its nature. During the cotton seedling growth stage, it is important to understand this characteristic. The weather does not care about cotton's characteristics; it tends to be cold when it should be warm. Like recently, wind and rain came and went, and the ground temperature dropped sharply. Now, although people cannot completely control the weather, they should understand its changes. People are adaptable, and when the weather changes, people must also adapt. The main reason why hoeing is especially important during the seedling stage is to maintain normal ground temperature. Applying more fertilizer and frequently applying strengthening soil during the seedling stage is both to ensure that the cotton is "fed" well and to keep the soil warm. If you don't understand this principle, just knowing that you need to apply enough manure and hoe well, it is often difficult to grasp the timing. If you can't grasp the timing, the cotton seedlings won't grow according to your wishes. Since hoeing during the seedling stage is for insulation, hoeing is necessary whether there are many weeds or few, after rain, and after applying manure. Some people see that the land is well prepared, the manure is thoroughly composted, and there are not many weeds in the field, so they are reluctant to hoe; this is because they don't understand this principle.

    In addition to insulation, the important tasks during the seedling management period are thinning and setting seedlings. Someone asked me: When is the best time to thin and set seedlings? I can only say: look at the sky, look at the land, and look at the crops. Some people say that early thinning is good; timely early thinning is of course good, but it also depends on the conditions. For example, if the climate suddenly turns cold, it may not be beneficial to strictly adhere to early thinning. Because when the weather is cold and the ground temperature drops, diseases develop quickly. Thinning the seedlings at this time will inevitably cause some cotton seedlings to be affected. This makes it difficult to ensure full stands. Is it bad to thin late? Of course it's bad; this has a great impact on cotton seedlings. In my opinion, you should hurry up and thin out any seedlings that have sprouted two or three true leaves but have not been thinned. There are techniques for thinning seedlings, including pinching, pulling, and hoeing. Which of these methods should be used depends on the seedlings. Hoeing seedlings easily damages the roots of good seedlings, and hoeing should not be used when the seedlings are dense. Pinching seedlings (by hand or with scissors) has many advantages; it does not damage the roots of good seedlings, nor does it affect the growth of good seedlings, but it cannot be used on diseased seedlings. If you pinch the upper part of a diseased seedling and leave the root, the disease is easily transmitted; it is best to pull it out and dispose of it away from the cotton field. The disadvantage of pulling seedlings is that it is easy to injure the roots of good seedlings, so the pulling method should not be used for seedlings that are not sick.

    Some people also ask how many seedlings should be left? This is a matter of rational close planting, which depends on various conditions. What conditions should you look at? First, look at the land, that is, look at the nature of the soil: sandy soil can leave more seedlings than loess soil (clayey and relatively fertile soil), and thin soil can leave more seedlings than fertile soil. Second, look at natural conditions: dry land can leave more seedlings than irrigated land. Third, look at the seeds: seeds with short branches can leave more seedlings than seeds with long branches. Fourth, look at the location: the edge of the field can leave more seedlings, and the center of the field should leave fewer. We advocate rational close planting, but it should still be dense overall. Some people think that proposing rational close planting means not needing to be dense anymore; this is wrong. Last year, our cotton planting team had 4,800 plants of cotton per mu, and this year it is set at 4,900 plants, which is not a decrease, but an increase of 100 plants. This is what we believe is a rational density that can be achieved with our various cultivation and technical conditions. This rational density may not be suitable for other people or places. How densely should you plant in a particular place? It is best for old farmers, middle-aged people, and young people to sit down together and hold a meeting to study and determine a suitable density based on local conditions. When learning from other people's experiences, don't just learn a few numbers.

    Pest control during the seedling stage is very important, and many people think it is difficult to do. Indeed, there are many pests and diseases during the seedling stage, and the impact is also great. This requires seizing the most important pests and diseases that have the greatest impact on the seedling stage, such as cutworms, aphids, and anthracnose, and vigorously controlling them. Cutworms are very stubborn; they come out at night to bite the seedlings and then burrow underground during the day, which is indeed a bit difficult to treat. Last year, we used our brains and came up with a baiting method, and finally defeated them. The method is: stir-fry ten catties of oil residue until cool, mix in three catties of wettable 666, and sprinkle it on the ground in the afternoon. The cutworms come out at night, eat the oil residue, and are all poisoned to death. Methods are created by people; pest control requires using your brains. Western pesticides should be used, and local pesticides should also be used. You cannot just wait for Western pesticides. Like cat's eye water and alfalfa root water, they can all control cotton anthracnose.

    The management tasks during the cotton seedling stage are very heavy, but doing a good job in seedling protection is actually not difficult. Our brigade has summarized five measures: "supplementing, setting, hoeing, preventing, and fertilizing," which are indeed the central tasks for successfully navigating the seedling stage. These methods are also applicable to other regions and are what our cotton planting team did last year. I believe that as long as we do these tasks well, we will definitely be able to achieve full and strong seedlings, laying a better foundation for a bumper cotton harvest.

    要棉花过好幼苗关
    张秋香
    棉花从出土到整个幼苗生长期间，是最经受不起自然灾害的时候，好比一个月娃子，一点照看不到也不行。这个时期的病虫害也多，别的变化也大。过好这一关，是棉花增产的一个骨节眼。
    棉苗能不能长好，要看环境怎么样。棉花喜温，凉了就不行，这是它的特性。在棉花幼苗生长期间，要懂得它的这个特性。天气是不管棉花的特性的，该暖的时候它偏偏冷一阵。就像前些时，风雨时来时往，地温猛然下降了。现在，人虽然还不能完全管住天气，可是应该掌握它的变化。人是活的，天气变了，人也要变。为什么幼苗期锄地要格外抓紧，主要是为了保持地温正常。在幼苗期多施、勤施壮土，一来是给棉花“吃”得好，二来也为了保温。不懂得这个道理，光知道要上足粪、要锄好，往往不容易拿住火候。定不住火候，棉苗生长就不会听人的话。既然苗期锄地是为了保温，草多要锄，草少也要锄，雨后要锄，施过粪也要锄。有人看见地整的好，粪沤的透，地里草不多，就不愿锄，就是不懂这个道理。
    除了保温，幼苗管理期中重要的工作就是间苗、定苗。有人问我：啥时间苗、定苗好？我只能说：看天、看地、看庄稼。有人说早间苗好；适时的早间苗当然好，但是也要看条件。比方说，气候突然变冷了，要是死按早间苗办事，就不一定有好处。因为天冷地温下降，病害发展很快，在这个时候间了苗，难免没有一些棉苗受害。这就很难保证全苗。迟了好不好？当然不好，这对棉花幼苗影响很大。我看，凡是出了两三个真叶没有间苗的，就该赶快间苗。间苗也有技术，有掐苗、拔苗和锄苗，这几样办法究竟该用那一种，要看苗子决定。锄苗容易伤好苗的根，苗密不可用锄苗法。掐苗（用手掐或剪子剪）好处多，不伤好苗的根，也不影响好苗生长，但对有病的苗子就不能用。有病的苗子掐上部，留根部，病害容易传染；最好是拔掉，带出棉田处理。拔苗的坏处就是容易伤动好苗的根，所以对没有生病的苗不要用拔苗的办法。
    有人还问留多少苗好？这是合理密植问题，要看各种条件。看什么条件呢？一要看地，就是看土壤的性质：沙地就比垆土地（粘性大的比较肥沃的土地）能多留，薄地就比肥地能多留。二要看自然条件：旱地就比水地能多留。三要看籽种：发枝短的籽种就比发枝长的籽种能多留。四要看内外：地边就能多留，地心就要少留。我们提倡合理密植，总还是要密。有人认为提出合理密植就是不要密了，这是不对的。去年我们植棉小组每亩棉花四千八百株，今年订为四千九百株，不是减了，还多了一百株。这就是我们认为在我们各种耕作、技术条件都可以办到的一个合理密度。这个合理密度对别的人别的地方不一定就合适。一个地方究竟密植多少？最好是老农、中年人、青年人坐在一起开一个会研究研究，根据本地的各种条件，订出合适的密度来。学别人的经验，不要光学几个数字。
    苗期防虫很重要，好多人都认为不好办。的确，苗期的虫害、病害较多，影响也大。这就要抓住最主要的、对苗期危害最大的，譬如地老虎、蚜虫、炭疽病等，狠狠地防治。地老虎很顽固，夜里出来咬苗子，白天又钻到地下，的确有点难治。去年，我们动了脑子，想了个诱杀办法，终于战胜了它。办法就是：用十斤油渣炒后晾凉，拌入三斤可湿性六六六，下午撒在地里，地老虎夜里出来，吃了油渣，都毒死了。办法是人想出来的，防虫是要动脑筋的。洋农药要用，土农药也要用，不能光等待洋农药。像猫儿眼水、苜蓿根水都能防治棉花炭疽病。
    棉花幼苗期的管理任务很重，做好保苗工作其实并不难。我们大队已总结出了“补、定、锄、防、肥”五个措施，这确实是过好幼苗关的中心工作。这些办法对其他地区也适用，也是我们植棉小组去年做过的。我相信只要做好这些工作，一定能做到苗全、苗壮，为棉花大丰收打下更好的基础。  （原载陕西日报）
