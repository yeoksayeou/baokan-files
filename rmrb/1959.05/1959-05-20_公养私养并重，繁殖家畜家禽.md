According to the 1959 national economic development plan, both livestock and poultry should be greatly developed. This year, an additional 100 million pigs are to be added, meaning that the total number of pigs in the country should increase from 180 million in 1958 to 280 million, a growth of 56%. At the same time, chickens, ducks, and geese should also have substantial increases.

Adding 100 million pigs in one year is unprecedented in our country. In 1949, China had just over 57 million pigs. By 1957, it had 145 million, an increase of just over 88 million in eight years. This year alone, we are to add 100 million. This is, of course, a very ambitious leap forward plan. All people's communes, state-owned farms, and all peasants throughout the country should strive to victoriously achieve this grand and arduous task.

Why do we need to develop China's pig farming industry at such an unprecedented speed? This is because the development of China's industrial and agricultural production requires more pigs, the further improvement of the people's lives requires more pigs, and communes and the vast number of members also need more pigs to increase income. The needs in these areas are urgent and necessary, so we must develop the pig-raising business as quickly as possible. In order to mobilize the vast number of peasants to complete this year's plan to increase pig raising, we should universally and thoroughly explain these aspects to them.

The development of agricultural production in our country, especially after the universal implementation of deep plowing and close planting, requires more fertilizer. At present, the output of chemical fertilizers in our country is very low, and we mainly rely on organic fertilizers such as human and animal manure. Raising pigs is an important source of organic fertilizer. The vast number of peasants know that a pigsty is equal to a small fertilizer factory. The refined fertilizer supplied by one pig per year is enough for the organic fertilizer needed for one mu of land. To ensure that our country's more than 1.6 billion mu of cultivated land have sufficient fertilizer, our pig-raising industry still needs to be increased several times or even ten times to meet the requirements. This also shows that the requirement to increase 100 million pigs this year cannot be said to be too high!

Raising more pigs is also a very important source of increasing the income of communes and peasants. It is reasonable for peasants to regard pigs as "their own small bank." According to investigations, the cost of raising a piglet into a fat pig is about 15 yuan (about 100 jin of refined feed, about 5 yuan, piglets about 10 yuan), and the selling price is about 50 yuan, making a profit of more than 30 yuan. If each farm household raises one more pig each year, the investment is not large, the labor is small, and the income can be increased by more than 30 yuan, which is, of course, a considerable income.

Pork is a popular food among the broad masses of the people in our country. With the development of production and the improvement of people's lives, the consumption of pork is increasing. China is a large country with a population of 650 million. Even if we calculate one jin of pork per person per month for 600 million people, it will be more than 7 billion jin a year. Based on 80 jin or 100 jin of meat per pig, it will require 70 to 80 million pigs. Eating one jin of meat per person per month is not a high standard compared with foreign countries. Although the people of our country have not generally reached this level today, this should be our preliminary goal, and we should strive to eat more in the next few years. At the same time, pork is also a major export commodity in our country. Every year, in order to purchase a large number of machinery and equipment from the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries, we need to export a large number of agricultural products, and pork is one of the main items. Therefore, in order to further improve the lives of the people throughout the country, and to ensure the completion of the pork export task, we must increase the number of pigs even more.

Our country has 120 million farm households. If 70 to 80 million of them raise one more pig per household, that would be 70 to 80 million pigs. Our country has more than 26,000 people's communes, and each people's commune has hundreds of production units and public canteens. It is entirely appropriate and possible for a public canteen and production unit to raise ten or dozens of pigs. In this way, a commune can raise thousands or thousands of pigs, and the whole country can have tens of millions of pigs. This does not include the number raised by state-owned farms. This year, when rural areas have realized communization and agricultural production will continue to leap forward, it is entirely possible to increase the number of pigs by 100 million in one year.

To further develop pig production, so that pigs are raised more, faster, better, and more economically, it is necessary to conscientiously implement the policy of simultaneously emphasizing collective and individual raising, in order to maximize the enthusiasm of leaders at all levels and the vast number of peasants in raising pigs. After the realization of the people's communes in the vast rural areas, in order to develop the diversified economy of the communes, the vast majority of people's communes have established pig farms, and the collective pig-raising business has been greatly developed, which is necessary. In the future, it is also necessary to further give play to the superiority of the people's communes and develop the collective pig-raising business even better. However, it is not enough to rely solely on collective breeding to raise more, faster, and better pigs. We must also vigorously promote and encourage individual members to raise pigs. The "Resolution on Certain Questions Concerning the People's Communes" of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party specifically pointed out: Members can retain "small livestock and poultry, etc., and can continue to engage in some small household side occupations, provided that they do not hinder participation in collective labor." Pigs, chickens, ducks, and geese are such small livestock and poultry. Raising pigs, chickens, ducks, and geese are such household side occupations. We should use effective methods to greatly develop these small side occupations.

After the realization of communization in rural areas, some commune cadres were afraid that raising pigs by members would hinder collective labor, so they did not actively support members in raising pigs and chickens. This concern is superfluous. Each farm household raises one or two pigs, or ten or eight chickens, which can be managed by the elderly and children, as long as the members take care of them a little before and after work, it will not affect collective labor. In order to correctly combine collective production and individual production, some practical systems and methods should be formulated to better combine collective production and individual production. Many places have already done this. They have effectively solved the contradictions between household side occupations and collective production by using methods such as contracting the number of workdays for the whole year, contracting the number of labor days that should be obtained for the whole year, implementing small-scale contracting, setting quotas, setting quality, and setting deadlines. Commune cadres should realize that appropriately developing the household sideline production of members, and appropriately developing household pig raising by members, the pigs are developed, the fertilizer is accumulated more, the pork supply is more abundant, the income of members is increased, and it is more conducive to the development of commune agricultural production, more conducive to the improvement and improvement of the lives of the people throughout the country, and more conducive to the further play of the labor enthusiasm of members.

To develop private pig raising by members more quickly, it is also necessary to set out some specific methods to ensure that members can profit from raising pigs, and earnestly help members solve practical difficulties in raising pigs. Many places such as Sichuan and Liaoning stipulate that: cash purchases of fat pigs from members; the state supplies several jin of pork for each fat pig sold by members; fertilizer is priced according to quality and purchased by production teams; communes help members solve problems such as piglets, etc. These practices are necessary and feasible.

At present, a key issue in developing private pig raising by members is the issue of feed. The fundamental solution to the feed problem is to allocate a portion of the land to be operated by the members themselves to produce feed. As for how much should be allocated to the members, it can be calculated according to the provisions of the original advanced agricultural cooperative charter, based on the population, not exceeding 5% of the average land owned per person; it can also be calculated based on pigs, allocating one or two fen of feed land per pig. Which method is better, the provincial, municipal, and autonomous region party committees can decide for themselves according to the local situation. The sooner this issue is resolved, the more conducive it will be for members to plant feed land without delaying agricultural time. As for the feed currently needed, it can also be resolved. Because: members' homes mostly have a certain amount of surplus grain; public canteens can save a certain amount of grain after rectification; the by-products of some side occupations run by communes and production teams, such as tofu workshops, flour workshops, and oil workshops, can also be used as feed. Now it is summer, which is the season when grass and trees grow luxuriantly, "pigs eat all kinds of grass," and the members' massive collection of green feed in their spare time is currently the most important way to solve the feed problem.

In order to encourage members to develop household pig raising, communes and production teams should also provide members with timely assistance in establishing pigsties, supplying piglets, sanitation and epidemic prevention, and exchanging experiences. For example, sell piglets from the commune or production brigade's pig farm to members at a reasonable price; when members are temporarily unable to purchase piglets and feed, they can also be resolved by means of advance wages or loans; give members necessary consideration in the arrangement of labor time so that they have time to collect and process feed. We believe that adopting these measures will further give play to the enthusiasm of members' household pig raising, so that collective pig raising and private pig raising will develop rapidly at the same time.

Like any other work, the fundamental guarantee for doing the above work well is to put politics in command, rely on the masses, and carry out mass movements in a big way. In order to prepare sufficient fertilizer for crops, in order to provide more meat for the people throughout the country, and in order to meet the needs of industrial production and export, party organizations at all levels should attach great importance to the work of raising pigs, chickens, ducks, and geese, do a good job in propaganda, raise the awareness of the masses, and take practical measures to make our country's livestock and poultry breed faster and more.

### 公养私养并重，繁殖家畜家禽

    公养私养并重，繁殖家畜家禽
    根据1959年国民经济发展计划，家畜家禽都要有很大发展。今年要增加一亿头猪，就是说，全国生猪头数要由1958年的一亿八千万头增加到二亿八千万头，增长56％。同时，鸡、鸭、鹅也要有很大的增加。
    一年之间增加一亿头猪，在我国是空前未有的。1949年，我国的生猪是五千七百多万头，到1957年为一亿四千五百多万头，八年间才增加了八千八百多万头，而今年一年就要增加一亿头，这当然是一个十分宏伟的跃进计划。全国人民公社、国营农场和全体农民，都应当努力奋斗，力争胜利实现这个宏伟而艰巨的任务。
    为什么要用这样空前未有的速度发展我国的生猪饲养业呢？这是因为我国工农业生产的发展需要更多的猪，全国人民生活的进一步改善需要更多的猪，公社和广大社员要增加收入也需要更多的猪。这几方面的需要都是迫切的和必要的，因此必须用尽可能快的速度发展养猪事业。为了动员广大农民完成今年增养生猪的计划，就应当普遍地、深入地向他们讲清楚这些方面的情况。
    我国农业生产的发展，特别是普遍实行深翻、密植以后，需要的肥料更多了。目前我国化学肥料产量很少，主要依靠人粪、畜粪等有机肥料。养猪正是有机肥料的重要来源。广大农民都知道，一圈猪等于一个小小的制肥厂。一头猪一年供应的精肥，足够一亩田需要的有机肥。要使我国有十六亿亩以上的耕地都有充足的肥料，我国养猪事业就还需要有几倍甚至十倍的增加，才能满足要求。这也可以看出，今年增养一亿头猪的要求不能说是太高了！
    多养猪又是增加公社和农民收入的一个很重要的来源。农民把猪看成是“自己的小银行”是有道理的。据调查，一头小猪长成肥猪，成本大约需要十五元左右（精饲料一百斤，约五元左右，猪仔十元左右），卖出时的价格是五十元左右，获利三十多元。每一个农户如果每年增养一头猪，投资不多，用工很少，就可增加三十多元的收入，这当然是一笔很可观的收入。
    猪肉是我国广大人民喜爱的食品。随着生产的发展和人民生活的提高，猪肉的消费量是越来越多。我国是一个六亿五千万人口的大国，就以六亿人每人每月吃一斤猪肉计算，一年就要七十多亿斤，按一头猪出肉八十斤或一百斤计算，就要七、八千万头。每人每月吃肉一斤，同外国比较，还不是一个高标准。尽管今天我国人民还没有普遍达到这个水平，但是这应该是我们初步的目标，并且力争今后若干年内，吃得还要更多一些。同时，猪肉还是我国一项主要出口物资，我国每年为了从苏联和其他兄弟国家购买大批机器设备，需要出口大批农产品，猪肉是其中主要的一项。因此，为了进一步改善全国人民的生活，为了保证完成猪肉出口任务，我们必须更多地增加生猪。
    我国有一亿二千万户农民，如果其中有七、八千万户农民每户增养一头猪，就是七、八千万头猪。我国有二万六千多个人民公社，每个人民公社又有上百个包产单位和公共食堂。一个公共食堂和包产单位养上十头或者几十头猪是完全应该的和可能的。这样，一个公社就可养千头或者几千头猪，全国也有几千万头猪。这还没有计算国营农场饲养的数量。在农村实现了公社化和农业生产将继续大跃进的今年，一年增加生猪一亿头是完全可能的。
    要进一步发展生猪生产，使生猪养得又多又快又好又省，就必需认真贯彻集体饲养和个人饲养同时并举的方针，以便最大限度地把各级领导和广大农民的养猪积极性调动起来。广大农村实现人民公社化以后，为了发展公社的多种经济，绝大多数的人民公社都建立了养猪场，集体养猪事业有了很大的发展，这是必要的。今后还需要进一步发挥人民公社的优越性，把集体养猪事业发展得更好。但是，猪要养得多、养得快、养得好，单单依靠集体饲养是不够的，还必须大力提倡和鼓励社员个人养猪。党的八届六中全会“关于人民公社若干问题的决议”中曾经特别指出：社员可以保留“小家畜和家禽等，也可以在不妨碍参加集体劳动的条件下，继续经营一些家庭小副业。”猪、鸡、鸭、鹅正是这样的小家畜、小家禽。养猪、养鸡、养鸭、养鹅，正是这样的家庭小副业。我们应当用有效的办法使这些小副业大大地发展起来。
    农村实现公社化以后，有些公社干部，怕社员养猪妨碍集体劳动，因此不积极支持社员养猪养鸡。这种顾虑是多余的，每户农民养一两头猪，养十只八只鸡，可以由老人、小孩等来经营，只要社员在上工前后稍加照料就够了，对集体劳动并无影响。为了使集体生产和个人生产正确地结合起来，应当制定出一些切实可行的制度和办法，使集体生产和个人生产更好地结合起来。有很多地方已经这样作了，他们用包全年出勤天数，包全年应得劳动日数，实行小段包工、定量、定质、限期完成等等办法，有效地解决了家庭副业和集体生产的矛盾。公社的干部应当认识到，适当地发展社员家庭副业生产，适当地发展社员家庭养猪，生猪发展了，肥料积造的多了，猪肉供应更充裕了，社员收入增多了，还更有利于公社农业生产的发展，更有利于全国人民生活的改善和提高，更有利于社员劳动积极性的进一步发挥。
    要更快地发展社员私人养猪，还必须定出若干具体的办法，保证社员养猪有利可图，并认真地帮助社员解决养猪中的实际困难。四川、辽宁等许多地方规定：现金收买社员的肥猪；社员每出卖一头肥猪由国家供应若干斤猪肉；肥料按质论价，由生产队收买；公社帮助社员解决猪仔等等问题。这些作法都是必要的，可行的。
    当前，发展社员私人养猪的一个关键性的问题是饲料问题。解决饲料问题的根本办法，是拨一部分土地由社员自己经营，生产饲料。至于应该拨给社员多少，可以按照原高级农业社章程的规定，按人口计算，不超过每人平均占有土地的5％；也可以按猪计算，每头猪拨给一分或者二分饲料地。究竟那种办法好，各省、市、自治区党委可根据当地的情况，自行决定。这个问题解决得越快越早，就越有利于社员不误农时地把饲料地种好。至于目前需要的饲料，也是能够解决的。因为：社员家中大都存有一定数量的余粮；公共食堂经过整顿后可以节约出一定数量的粮食；公社、生产队经营的一些副业如豆腐坊、粉坊、油坊等的副产品也可以拿来作饲料。现在是夏天，正是草木繁茂生长的季节，“猪吃百样草”，社员在劳动余暇大量收集青饲料，是目前解决饲料问题的最重要的办法。
    为了鼓励社员发展家庭养猪，公社和生产队还要在建立猪圈、供应猪仔、卫生防疫、交流经验等方面及时给社员以帮助。例如把公社或生产大队养猪场的猪仔合理作价卖给社员；社员暂时无力购买猪仔和饲料时，还可以采取预支工资或贷款的方式来解决；在劳动时间的安排上给社员必要的照顾，以便他们有时间收集和加工饲料。我们相信，采取这些办法，一定会进一步发挥社员家庭养猪的积极性，使集体养猪和私人养猪同时迅速发展起来。
    像其他任何工作一样，作好上述工作的根本保证是政治挂帅，依靠群众，大搞群众运动。为了给农作物准备充足的肥料，为了使全国人民有更多的肉食，为了满足工业生产和出口的需要，各级党组织应当十分重视养猪、养鸡、养鸭、养鹅的工作，作好宣传，提高群众认识，并采取切实措施，使我国的家畜家禽更快地、更多地繁殖起来。
