This newspaper, Guangzhou, 18th dispatch: "Treat pests immediately, eradicate diseases thoroughly," "Leave no plot untouched, allow no insect to escape," These are the battle slogans proposed by various places in the Foshan Special Zone, Guangdong Province, to strive for a bumper harvest of early rice. At present, more than 50,000 people in the entire special zone are working in the fields every day to prevent and control pests and diseases.

Since the beginning of spring this year, the Foshan Special Zone has experienced high temperatures, abundant rainfall, and high humidity, resulting in particularly rapid growth of rice seedlings, earlier closing of rows than in previous years. Furthermore, some japonica rice seeds were not strictly disinfected, leading to an early and rapid spread of pests and diseases this year. In particular, acute rice blast has become widespread in counties such as Nanhai, Fanshun, Dongguan, and Huiyang. Diseases like rice bakanae disease, rice sheath blight, rice seedling blight, as well as pests such as rice stem borers, planthoppers, and hispa beetles have also appeared successively.

In order to strive to completely eradicate pests and diseases, all localities have implemented the policy of "prevention first, treatment supplemented" and the principles of "early treatment, treatment at a small scale, continuous treatment, and thorough treatment." After the Huadong Commune in Hua County discovered rice blast, the county party committee immediately convened an on-site meeting of the party committee secretaries of each commune in the Huadong Commune to study measures to eliminate rice blast on the spot, promoting comprehensive prevention and control work in various communes. One to two applications of pesticides were sprayed on thousands of acres of land affected by rice blast, effectively suppressing the disease. In Huiyang County, communes organized more than 3,000 people to specifically and consistently spray Bordeaux mixture and various indigenous pesticides on 16,000 acres of land affected by rice blast, bringing the disease under control. Fanshun County adopted three major measures in various communes to prevent and control acute rice blast in japonica rice: "spraying pesticides, applying appropriate amounts of fertilizer, and draining water during the day and irrigating at night," achieving good results. In pest control work, key communes in many counties have established pest and disease forecasting stations, ensuring that every team has informants and every plot of land has scouts, promptly grasping the pest situation and suppressing them as early as possible. After the Lianxing Commune in Conghua County discovered hispa beetles and case worms on more than 200 acres of land, it immediately mobilized forces to adopt the method of "combining weeding with pest control, combining foreign pesticides with indigenous pesticides, and combining fertilizer accumulation with pesticide extraction" to carry out pest control. Commune members soaked a large amount of green leaves from wild plants such as ram's horn and bitter neem in water and applied it to rice seedlings, which not only increased soil fertility but also killed insects, achieving two goals at once. The Xinyao Brigade of the Wanqing Commune in Zhongshan County organized a professional team to carry out a blitzkrieg to eliminate pests. They also established an intelligence network with the production team's irrigation and drainage personnel as the core, promptly eliminating pests after they were discovered. The characteristic of pest and disease prevention and control in the Foshan Special Zone this year is the implementation of the policy of "comprehensive prevention and control with indigenous pesticides and focused eradication with foreign pesticides." Various counties have universally mobilized the masses to manufacture large quantities of indigenous pesticides to solve the difficulty of insufficient pesticides. 685 indigenous pesticide factories in the region have been put into production, with approximately 10,000 people specifically engaged in this production. To date, more than 100,000 dan of various indigenous pesticides have been produced.

    有虫即治　有病即除　一块不漏　一虫不放
    佛山专区防治早稻病虫害
    本报广州18日电　“有虫即治、有病即除”，“一块不漏，一虫不放”，这是广东省佛山专区各地为争取早稻丰收提出的除虫灭病的战斗口号。目前全专区每天出动五万多人在田地上进行防除病虫害工作。
    今年入春以来，佛山专区由于气温高、雨水多、湿度大，禾苗生长特别快，比往年提早封行，加上有部分粳稻的种子未经严格消毒，以致今年的病虫害来得早，蔓延快。特别是急性稻热病，在南海、番顺、东莞、惠阳等县已经普遍发生。徒长病、菌核病、立枯病和三化螟虫、浮尘子、背屎虫等，也陆续出现了。
    为了力争把病虫害全面扑灭，各地都贯彻执行了“预防为主，除治为辅”和“治早、治小、连续治、彻底治”的方针。花县花东公社发现稻热病后，县委便立即在花东公社召开各公社党委书记现场会议，就地研究消灭稻热病的措施，推动各公社开展全面防治工作，在患稻热病的几千亩田上喷射一至二次农药，及时扑灭了病害。惠阳县各公社共组织了三千多人专门固定向发生稻热病的一万六千亩田喷射波尔多液和各种土农药，把稻热病制止下来。番顺县各公社采用“喷撒药物、适量施肥、日排夜灌”三大措施来防治粳稻的急性稻热病，取得了良好的效果。在防虫除虫工作上，不少县的重点公社都建立病虫害预测预报站，做到队队有情报员，块块田有侦察兵，及时掌握虫害情况，趁早扑灭。从化县联星公社发现二百多亩田有背屎虫、负坭虫后，立即抽出力量采取“除草与除虫相结合、洋药剂与土农药相结合、积肥与取农药相结合”的办法进行除虫。社员把大量羊角纽、苦机等野生植物的绿叶浸水施到禾苗上，这样做既可增加土地肥力，又可以杀虫，一举两得。中山县万顷公社新要大队组织专业队进行突击除虫。他们并以生产队的排灌员为核心建立情报网，发现虫害后便及时消灭。佛山专区今年防治病虫害的特点是贯彻了“土农药全面防治、洋农药重点肃清”的方针，各县普遍发动群众大量制造土农药解决农药不足的困难。全区有六百八十五个土农药厂已经投入生产，约有一万多人专门从事这项生产。到目前止，已生产出各种土农药十万多担。
