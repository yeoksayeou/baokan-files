The Heroic Struggle of the Hungarian People Has Always Been Sincerely Admired by the Chinese People
Comrade Peng Zhen's Speech at the Rally of People from All Walks of Life in the Capital Welcoming the Hungarian Party and Government Delegation

Respected Comrade Münnich Ferenc, Respected Comrades of the Hungarian Party and Government Delegation, Comrades, Friends:

On the eve of the great "May Day" International Labor Day, people from all walks of life in our capital, with excitement, gather here to warmly welcome the intimate friends of the Chinese people, Comrade Münnich Ferenc, Member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, Chairman of the Hungarian Revolutionary Worker-Peasant Government, and all the comrades of the Hungarian Party and Government Delegation. On behalf of the people of the capital and the entire Chinese people, I would like to express our high respect to our respected guests, and through you, to the fraternal Hungarian people.

The Hungarian people are a heroic people with a glorious revolutionary tradition. The heroic struggle of the Hungarian people has always been closely watched and sincerely admired by the Chinese people. A little over a month ago, we, together with the Hungarian people, solemnly commemorated the 40th anniversary of the founding of the Hungarian Soviet Republic. Today, we have the opportunity to meet here with Comrade Münnich, an active participant in the Hungarian proletarian revolution of 1919 and one of the commanders of the Hungarian Red Army in those years, and the Hungarian Party and Government Delegation headed by him, which makes us feel extremely happy and honored.

The diligent and courageous Hungarian people, since liberation fourteen years ago, have been carrying out socialist construction with high labor enthusiasm and have achieved brilliant achievements. In particular, after the Hungarian people eliminated the counter-revolutionary rebellion in the winter of 1956, under the leadership of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party and the Hungarian Revolutionary Worker-Peasant Government, the socialist construction of Hungary has developed more rapidly. The industrial output value in 1958 increased by 12% compared with 1957. Now, Hungary's industrial output has reached more than three times that of pre-war levels. In agriculture, although 1958 suffered from natural disasters, the total agricultural output value still increased by 5%. Hungary's agricultural cooperativization movement is rapidly developing forward with a surging momentum. Now the socialist component in agriculture has increased from 26.5% of the country's cultivated land area last year to 48%. While the national economy is constantly developing, the people's material and cultural living standards have also improved accordingly. The Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party enjoys a high prestige among the masses of the people. The Hungarian people are closely united around the Party and are marching bravely on the road of socialism. In the Hungarian general election in November last year, the candidates of the Patriotic People's Front received 99.6% of the votes, which eloquently proves the Hungarian people's great trust and heartfelt love for the Party. Now, the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party has put forward the bold slogan of striving to complete the main targets of the Three-Year Plan within two years. The broad masses of the Hungarian people are actively responding to this call of the Party and are launching a vigorous socialist labor competition. There is no doubt that the Hungarian people will continue to achieve even more brilliant victories in the future struggle. We are very happy about this.

The Hungarian Party and Government, following the principles of Marxism-Leninism, have always been unswervingly striving to strengthen the unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union, and to strengthen the unity of the international communist movement centered on the Communist Party of the Soviet Union. In order to safeguard the purity of Marxism-Leninism, the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party is waging a resolute struggle against Yugoslav modern revisionism. The Hungarian People's Republic has consistently pursued a peaceful foreign policy, fully supporting the efforts of all peace-loving countries and people to maintain peace, supporting the struggle of the people of Asian, African and Latin American countries against colonialism and for the attainment and maintenance of national independence, and resolutely opposing the aggressive and war policies of the imperialist camp headed by the United States. The Hungarian people have made, and will continue to make, significant contributions to the cause of maintaining world peace and promoting human progress.

The people of China and Hungary have forged a deep fighting friendship in the long-term common revolutionary struggle. The victory of the great October Socialist Revolution, as well as the upsurge of revolutionary movements in European countries, including the Hungarian proletarian revolution of 1919, greatly inspired and promoted the Chinese people's revolutionary struggle. The occurrence of the "May Fourth" Movement, which marked the great beginning of the Chinese New Democratic Revolution, is inseparable from the influence of the then booming international workers' movement. Since then, after years of arduous struggle, the people of our two countries have been liberated and have become the masters of their own countries. In the socialist family headed by the Soviet Union, the people of China and Hungary are close brothers. In the struggle against common enemies, we support each other. In the common cause of building socialism, we help each other. Common interests and common ideals closely link us together. In recent years, the mutual visits of leaders of our two countries and the extensive development of economic ties and cultural exchanges between the two countries have further strengthened the friendly cooperation between the two peoples and promoted the common upsurge of socialist construction in the two countries. We firmly believe that with the passage of time, the unbreakable fraternal friendship between the people of China and Hungary will surely be consolidated and developed day by day.

The Chinese people have received strong support from the Hungarian people in their revolutionary struggle and socialist construction, and in the struggle against the US imperialism's occupation of our territory Taiwan. The Chinese people cherish this fraternal support very much. Here, we would like to express our sincere gratitude from our 650 million people to Comrade Münnich and all the comrades of the Hungarian Party and Government Delegation, and through you, to the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party and the Hungarian people.

Long live the unbreakable fraternal friendship between the people of China and Hungary!
Long live the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union!
Long live the great unity of the people of the world!
Long live world peace!

    匈牙利人民的英勇斗争
    一向为中国人民衷心钦佩
    彭真同志在首都各界欢迎匈党政代表团大会上的讲话敬爱的明尼赫·费伦茨同志，敬爱的匈牙利党政代表团的全体同志们，同志们，朋友们：
    正当伟大的“五一”国际劳动节的前夕，我们首都各界人民，怀着兴奋的心情在这里集会，热烈地欢迎中国人民亲密的朋友、匈牙利社会主义工人党中央委员会政治局委员、匈牙利工农革命政府总理明尼赫·费伦茨同志和匈牙利党政代表团的全体同志们。我谨代表首都人民和全中国人民，向我们敬爱的贵宾们，并且通过你们，向兄弟的匈牙利人民表示崇高的敬意。
    匈牙利人民是具有光荣革命传统的英雄的人民。匈牙利人民的英勇斗争，一向为中国人民所密切注视和衷心钦佩。一个多月以前，我们同匈牙利人民一起，隆重地纪念了匈牙利苏维埃共和国成立的四十周年。今天，我们又有机会在这里会见匈牙利1919年无产阶级革命的积极参加者、当年匈牙利红军的司令员之一的明尼赫同志和以他为首的匈牙利党政代表团，使我们感到莫大的喜悦和荣幸。
    勤劳勇敢的匈牙利人民，从解放的十四年来，以高度的劳动热情进行着社会主义建设，取得了辉煌的成就。特别是匈牙利人民在消灭1956年冬天的反革命叛乱之后，在匈牙利社会主义工人党和匈牙利工农革命政府的领导下，匈牙利的社会主义建设有了更迅速的发展。1958年的工业产值，比1957年增长了12％。现在，匈牙利的工业产量，已经达到战前的三倍以上。在农业方面，1958年虽然遭受了自然灾害，但是农业总产值仍然增长了5％。匈牙利的农业合作化运动，正在以汹涌澎湃之势迅速地向前发展。现在农业中的社会主义成份，已经从去年占全国耕地面积的26.5％增加到48％。在国民经济不断发展的同时，人民的物质和文化生活水平也有相应的提高。匈牙利社会主义工人党在人民群众中享有崇高的威信，匈牙利人民紧密地团结在党的周围，在社会主义的大道上奋勇迈进。在去年11月匈牙利的大选中，爱国人民阵线的候选人得到99.6％的选票，它雄辩地证明了匈牙利人民对党的巨大信任和衷心爱戴。现在，匈牙利社会主义工人党提出了争取在两年内完成三年计划主要指标的豪迈口号。匈牙利的广大人民正积极响应党的这一号召，掀起热火朝天的社会主义劳动竞赛。毫无疑问，匈牙利人民将在今后的斗争中，不断取得更加辉煌的胜利。我们对此感到十分高兴。
    匈牙利的党和政府遵循着马克思列宁主义的原则，始终不渝地为加强以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结，为加强以苏联共产党为中心的国际共产主义运动的团结而努力。为了维护马克思列宁主义的纯洁性，匈牙利社会主义工人党同南斯拉夫现代修正主义进行着坚决的斗争。匈牙利人民共和国一贯奉行和平的外交政策，全力支持一切爱好和平的国家和人民维护和平的努力，支持亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国人民反对殖民主义、争取和维护民族独立的斗争，坚决反对以美国为首的帝国主义阵营的侵略政策和战争政策。匈牙利人民对于维护世界和平、促进人类进步的事业，过去已经，今后还将继续作出重大的贡献。
    中匈两国人民，在长期的共同革命斗争中，结成了深厚的战斗友谊。伟大的十月社会主义革命的胜利，以及包括匈牙利1919年无产阶级革命在内的欧洲各国革命运动的高涨，大大地鼓舞了和推动了中国人民的革命斗争。标志着中国新民主主义革命伟大开端的“五四”运动的发生，就是同当时蓬勃发展的国际工人运动的影响分不开的。从那时以来，经过多年的艰苦奋斗，我们两国人民都获得了解放，成了自己国家的主人。在以苏联为首的社会主义大家庭中，中匈两国人民是亲密的兄弟。在反对共同敌人的斗争中，我们互相支持。在建设社会主义的共同事业中，我们互相帮助。共同的利益和共同的理想把我们紧密地联结在一起。近年以来，我们两国的领导人的相互访问，两国经济联系和文化交流的广泛发展，更进一步加强了两国人民之间的友好合作，促进了两国社会主义建设的共同高涨。我们深信，随着时间的推移，中匈两国人民牢不可破的兄弟友谊定将日益巩固，日趋发展。
    中国人民在自己的革命斗争和社会主义建设中，在反对美国帝国主义侵占我国领土台湾的斗争中，得到了匈牙利人民的有力支持。中国人民十分珍视这种兄弟的支援。我们在这里谨向明尼赫同志和匈牙利党政代表团的全体同志们，并且通过你们，向匈牙利社会主义工人党和匈牙利人民表示我们六亿五千万人民诚挚的谢意。
    中匈两国人民之间的牢不可破兄弟友谊万岁！
    以苏联为首的社会主义阵营万岁！
    世界人民大团结万岁！
    世界和平万岁！
