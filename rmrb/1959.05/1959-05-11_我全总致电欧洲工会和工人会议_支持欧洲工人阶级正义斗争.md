    ACFTU Sends Telegram to European Trade Union and Workers' Conference
    Supporting the Just Struggle of the European Working Class
    (Xinhua News Agency) The All-China Federation of Trade Unions (ACFTU) sent a telegram on the 8th to the European Trade Union and Workers' Conference, supporting the just struggle of the European working class to defend peace and oppose the imperialists' use of the German question to create international tension.
    The telegram said: "Germany is the source of two world wars, and therefore the settlement of the German question is not only related to the interests of the German people, but also to world peace. The Chinese people and workers fully support the various positive initiatives repeatedly put forward by the Soviet government for the peaceful settlement of the German question, and support the signing of a peace treaty with Germany and making West Berlin a free city. Your gathering will further demonstrate the European working class's determination to resolutely defend peace and oppose the imperialists' use of the German question to create international tension. The Chinese working class will stand behind you and will join you in unremitting struggle until the German question is properly resolved."

    我全总致电欧洲工会和工人会议
    支持欧洲工人阶级正义斗争
    据新华社讯　中华全国总工会8日致电欧洲工会和工人会议，支持欧洲工人阶级捍卫和平、反对帝国主义者利用德国问题制造国际紧张局势的正义斗争。
    电报说：“德国是两次世界大战的策源地，因而德国问题的解决不仅关系到德国人民的利益，同时也关系到世界的和平。中国人民和工人完全支持苏联政府所一再提出的和平解决德国问题的各项积极倡议，支持签订对德和约和使西柏林成为自由城市。你们的集会将进一步显示着欧洲工人阶级坚决捍卫和平、反对帝国主义者利用德国问题制造国际紧张局势的决心。中国工人阶级将作为你们的后盾，将与你们一起进行不懈的斗争，直到德国问题获得正确的解决为止。”
