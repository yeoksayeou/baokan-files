The Situation of Overall Leap Forward is Pressing: We Must Seriously Study Theory

    Deeply Recognize the Great Significance of Studying Theory

    As early as twenty years ago, in his report at the Sixth Plenary Session of the Sixth Central Committee of the Party, Chairman Mao said: "The task of studying Marxist-Leninist theory universally and deeply is a major issue that needs to be resolved urgently and that we must focus on. I hope that after this plenary session of the Central Committee, a party-wide learning competition will begin to see who has truly learned something, who has learned more and better. From the perspective of bearing the main leadership responsibility, if our party has one hundred to two hundred comrades who have systematically, rather than fragmentarily, and practically, rather than emptily, learned Marxism-Leninism, it will greatly enhance our party's combat power and accelerate our work in defeating Japanese imperialism." Today, as we revisit Chairman Mao's speech, we feel its importance even more deeply.

    Since the Great Leap Forward last year, we have seen many new things emerge in all aspects, all of which require us to strengthen the study of Marxist-Leninist theory. For example, the widespread application of materialist dialectics in our country's practical work in all aspects has yielded a wealth of experience, which we should theoretically summarize; the theory of continuous revolution and the stage theory of revolutionary development have also gained rich experience in our country's practice, and should also be summarized; the role of commodity production, the law of value, and the principle of distribution according to work in our country's actual life also need to be clarified theoretically; in the development of our country's national economy, how to master the law of planned and proportionate development is also a problem with extremely rich content, which also urgently needs to be studied. There are other theoretical issues that general cadres and activists should study and understand. Now it is necessary to widely launch a theoretical study movement to meet this practical need.

    Now cadres at all levels are increasingly aware of the great significance of studying theory, and many problems in practical work must be solved by them. The pressing situation makes many cadres deeply feel the danger of making mistakes if they do not study theory. The popularization of theory in the previous period has also laid some foundation among cadres and mass activists. Therefore, it is now not only possible to further expand the popularization of basic Marxist-Leninist theory, but also possible to further expand the research and improvement of several important theoretical issues of Marxism-Leninism.

    For the entire theoretical study movement, we hope that we must both prevent and overcome the tendency of dogmatism, and actively promote the atmosphere of reading and studying seriously. There was once a view that "practice is theory." This is wrong and is one of the most harmful statements that belittles theory. We must adhere to the principle of combining theory and practice at all times. In the process of learning and research, we must advocate daring to think and speak, give play to creativity, and cultivate good habits of mutual discussion. This is an important issue related to the quality of study style. If we want to carry out the Marxist-Leninist theoretical study movement well, we must adhere to the correct study style that our Party Central Committee has consistently required.

    To Organize a Climax of Studying Theory

    In order to improve our awareness in our work, better implement the Party's various policies, and promote the continued Great Leap Forward of socialist construction, we should launch a climax of studying Marxist-Leninist theory.

    The current situation is very favorable for launching such a climax. On the one hand, the Party Central Committee and Comrade Mao Zedong's development and contribution to Marxist-Leninist theory have enriched the learning content of our vast number of cadres and masses, and provided us with a great example of how to combine the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism with the concrete practice of the Chinese revolution. On the other hand, in this leaping forward situation of ten thousand horses galloping and advancing a thousand miles a day, the vast number of cadres and masses deeply feel the importance of theory and have an urgent need to study theory. At the same time, the various policies formulated by the Party Central Committee and a series of issues raised by the Great Leap Forward need to be explained and summarized theoretically, so as to improve our political and professional level.

    How can we correctly and effectively launch such a climax of studying Marxist-Leninist theory?

    First of all, we must adhere to the principle of combining theory with practice in the study and research of theory. Combining theory with practice "means to study Marxist-Leninist theory purposefully," and "to combine Marxist-Leninist theory with the actual movement of the Chinese revolution." Theory must be combined with practice, which is determined by the essence of Marxism-Leninism. Because if Marxist-Leninist theory is divorced from practice, it will lose its vitality and its meaning of existence. In implementing this policy, we must oppose dogmatism and empiricism. Dogmatism is satisfied with the memory and recitation of theoretical words and phrases, not regarding theory as a guide to action, but as a panacea. Empiricism is satisfied with a smattering of knowledge, like a frog at the bottom of a well, not looking at problems from the perspective of development, belittling the role of theory, and unwilling and afraid to read seriously.

    On the issue of opposing dogmatism, we must overcome the misunderstanding that "reading big books is dogmatism (the so-called big books here obviously refer to the basic theories of Marxism-Leninism), and studying the Party's policies is connecting with reality." Whether there is dogmatism in learning does not lie in what to learn, but in how to learn. If we do not conduct independent thinking in learning, do not comprehend the spirit and essence of the document, but mechanically copy and apply it regardless of time, place, and conditions, we will also make dogmatic mistakes in studying the Party's policies. Studying the Party's policies is very necessary. Because the correct policies are precisely the vivid and lively theory that guides practice, the living and fighting Marxism-Leninism, which has more realistic significance for our current work. However, our Party's policies are all formulated based on the universal truth of Marxism-Leninism. In order to trace the origin and better understand the Party's policies, we must study the basic theories of Marxism-Leninism. Therefore, we must not think that "studying big books" is dogmatism.

    On the issue of opposing empiricism, we should overcome another misunderstanding that "practice is theory." Indeed, theory is produced from practice, but practice is not theory. Practice is not theory, just as raw materials are not finished products. Theory is produced in practice, which requires repeated practice, and requires "the effort of transforming and creating by discarding the crude and selecting the refined, discarding the false and retaining the true, proceeding from the one to the other, and from the outside to the inside." Equating practice with theory is actually abolishing theory.

    Secondly, in the study and research of theory, we must combine breaking superstitions with serious reading. When we advocate breaking superstitions, we only mean that we cannot treat books with a dogmatic attitude, nor can we treat knowledge with an empirical attitude. We advocate daring to think, speak, and act in order to oppose the right-leaning conservative ideology of following old habits and sticking to conventions, and to do things that can be done through efforts, rather than stubbornly doing things that are actually impossible to do. Therefore, breaking superstitions, liberating the mind, and daring to think, speak, and act must be carried out under the guidance of Marxism-Leninism and based on the Party's policies. The more and deeper we study Marxist-Leninist theory and the Party's policies, the more we can break superstitions and liberate our minds.

    Squeeze Out Time to Read

    Recently, I have met some comrades. When talking about it, they always say that they are busy with work and cannot find time to read. It seems that the contradiction between reading and time needs to be resolved.

    When will our work not be busy? Is it necessary to wait until we are not busy or not too busy to read?

    We are doing revolutionary work, and we must care about the thoughts, work, life, and study of the people every day and every hour, care about everything of the masses, no matter how big or small, and do it carefully and conscientiously, in order to be worthy of being a good cadre of the people. Therefore, we are not idle, but busy. Being busy is a normal phenomenon for us to be a revolutionary cadre. If we must wait until we have free time to read, wouldn't it actually mean that we are not prepared to read? This month we say that next month we should have some free time to read some books! When next month comes, we are still busy, so we feel annoyed once, and next month we will feel annoyed again, but we still haven't read the books. If this vicious cycle continues, time will pass quickly. When will we have time to read?

    I think it is necessary to analyze the reasons for being busy with work. There are many things to do and heavy responsibilities, which is one aspect. However, there is also another aspect. That is: our knowledge is not broad, our ideological level is not high, and we do not see problems deeply, accurately, and thoroughly. Therefore, we are always unable to open up the situation and take the initiative, and we are always busy. If our knowledge is broader, our level of ideological understanding is higher, and we see problems more deeply, accurately, and thoroughly, wouldn't we be able to "handle things with ease" and have better results?

    However, how can we broaden our knowledge, improve our level of ideological understanding, and see problems more deeply, accurately, and thoroughly? Reading is an extremely important aspect of enriching knowledge and improving the level of ideological understanding. Moreover, we are doing revolutionary work, and this revolutionary work is carried out under the guidance of Marxist-Leninist theory. If we don't even read Marxist-Leninist books seriously, and don't even study the Party's policies seriously, how can we see the direction clearly and make up our minds? Our revolutionary work is concrete, and every kind of revolutionary work requires rich professional knowledge. If we don't read books in this area and are satisfied with being a layman, how can we not get busier and make more mistakes, and the more mistakes we make, the busier we get? If we are truly responsible for serving the people, how can we not feel sad about the mistakes we have made or the delays in work due to not reading or reading less?

    Being busy with work is a fact, and we will continue to be busy in the future. It is easy to make mistakes when we are busy, so we need to read more. What to do? Only steal time from being busy to read more books. This means squeezing out time to read. Although we are very busy with work, there is one situation that is worth our attention. That is, no matter how busy we are, if the district, county, or city convenes a meeting, even if it lasts for half a day or a day, the work is still carried out, and it may not be done any worse. What is the mystery? It is nothing more than being forced to make some arrangements, prioritizing the urgent and important, and each person is responsible. It can be seen that if we really arrange it well, it is not impossible to squeeze out time to read. Of course, there are also exceptions where we cannot squeeze out time to read, but each time it only lasts for a few days, and it will not be like this every day. We are not working every minute and every second of the day, and there will always be gaps of ten minutes or a quarter of an hour in between. It is naturally difficult and unrealistic to read a lot of books or understand them very deeply in such a short time. However, it is possible to use this short time to read a few lines, inspire our thoughts, and activate our minds as a kind of rest and enjoyment. I think that over time, there will always be some gains. What's more, we also have holidays, and we can get up earlier or go to bed later. If we really want to read, we can always squeeze out this time to read.

### 全面跃进形势逼人  必须认真学习理论

    全面跃进形势逼人  必须认真学习理论
    深刻认识学习理论的重大意义
    早在二十年前，在党的六届六中全会上的报告中，毛主席就说过：“普遍地深入地研究马克思列宁主义的理论的任务，对于我们，是一个亟待解决并须着重地致力才能解决的大问题。我希望从我们这次中央全会之后，来一个全党的学习竞赛，看谁真正地学到了一点东西，看谁学的更多一点，更好一点。在担负主要领导责任的观点上说，如果我们党有一百个至二百个系统地而不是零碎地、实际地而不是空洞地学会了马克思列宁主义的同志，就会大大地提高我们党的战斗力量，并加速我们战胜日本帝国主义的工作。”今天我们重温毛主席的讲话，更加深刻地感觉到它的重要意义。
    从去年大跃进以来，我们看到各方面都出现了许多新的事物，都需要我们加强马克思列宁主义理论的研究。比如，唯物论辩证法在我国各方面实际工作中的普遍运用，取得了极丰富的经验，我们应该加以理论的总结；不断革命论和革命发展的阶段论，在我国的实践中也得到了丰富的经验，也应该有所总结；商品生产、价值法则和按劳分配原则在我国实际生活中所起的作用，同样需要从理论上加以阐明；在我国国民经济的发展中，怎样掌握有计划按比例发展的规律问题，这也是有极丰富的内容的，同样亟须加以研究。还有其他理论问题，都是一般干部和群众积极分子应该学习和领会的。现在必须广泛地展开一个理论的学习运动，以满足这个实际需要。
    现在各级干部日益认识了学习理论的重大意义，实际工作中的许多问题非要他们解决不可。形势逼人，使许多干部深感不学习理论就有犯错误的危险。而前一个时期的理论普及工作或多或少地在干部和群众积极分子中，也已经打下了一些基础。因此，现在不但有可能进一步展开马克思列宁主义的基础理论的普及工作，并且有可能进一步展开关于马克思列宁主义的若干重要理论问题的研究和提高的工作。
    对于整个理论学习运动，我们希望，既要防止和克服教条主义的倾向，又要积极地提倡认真读书和研究的风气。曾经有一种论调说：“实际就是理论。”这是错误的，是轻视理论的一种最有害的说法。我们在任何时候都要坚持理论和实际结合的方针。在学习和研究的过程中，要提倡敢想敢说，发挥创造性，并且养成互相讨论的良好习惯。这是关系到学风好坏的重要问题。我们要把马克思列宁主义的理论学习运动开展得好，就一定要坚持树立我们党中央所一贯要求的正确的学风。
    （摘自北京“前线”第九期社论：必须开展一个理论学习运动）
    要组织学习理论的高潮
    为了提高我们工作中的自觉性，更好地贯彻党的各项方针与政策，以促使社会主义建设继续大跃进，我们应当掀起一个学习马克思列宁主义理论的高潮。
    当前的形势对掀起这样一个高潮是十分有利的。一方面，党中央和毛泽东同志对马克思列宁主义理论的发展和贡献，丰富了我们广大干部和群众的学习内容，给我们在如何运用马克思列宁主义普遍真理与中国革命具体实践相结合的原则上，做出了伟大范例。另一方面，在这万马奔腾一日千里的跃进形势下，广大干部和群众深深感到理论的重要，产生了学习理论的迫切要求。同时，党中央所规定的各项方针政策和大跃进提出的一系列的问题，又需要从理论上加以阐明和总结，从而提高我们的政治水平和业务水平。
    怎样才能正确地、有效地掀起这样一个学习马克思列宁主义理论高潮呢？
    首先，必须在理论的学习与研究中坚持理论联系实际的原则。理论联系实际，“就是要有目的地去研究马克思列宁主义的理论”，就是“要使马克思列宁主义的理论和中国革命的实际运动结合起来”。理论必须与实际相结合，这是由马克思列宁主义的本质决定的。因为马克思列宁主义的理论如果与实践相脱离，就失掉了生命力，就失掉了它存在的意义。在贯彻这一方针中，必须反对教条主义和经验主义。教条主义满足于理论词句的记忆和背诵，不是把理论看作是行动的指南，而是当作医治百病的药方。经验主义满足于一知半解，井底天文，不从发展看问题，轻视理论的作用，不愿意并且害怕认真读书。
    在反对教条主义的问题上，必须克服人们这样一种误解：“读大本书就是教条主义（这里说的大本书，显然是指的马克思列宁主义的基本理论），学习党的方针就是联系实际。”学习上是否存在着教条主义，不在于学什么，而在于如何学。如果在学习中不进行独立思考，不去领会文件的精神与实质，而是不分时间地点条件地生搬硬套，学习党的方针政策同样会犯教条主义的错误。学习党的方针政策是十分必要的。因为正确的方针政策正是指导实践的生动活泼的理论，是活生生的战斗的马克思列宁主义，它对于我们当前工作更有现实的意义。但是，我们党的方针政策都是根据马克思列宁主义的普遍真理制定的。为了追本求源，更好地理解党的方针政策，必须学习马克思列宁主义的基本理论。因此，决不能认为“学大本书”就是教条主义。
    在反对经验主义的问题上，应克服人们“实践即理论”的另一误解。的确，理论是从实践中产生的，但实践并不是理论。实践不是理论，正如原料不是成品的道理一样。实践中产生理论，需要反复地实践，需要“去粗取精、去伪存真、由此及彼、由表及里的改造制作工夫”。把实践与理论等同起来，实际上就是取消了理论。
    其次，在理论的学习与研究中，必须使破除迷信和认真读书相结合。我们提倡破除迷信，只是说不能以教条主义的态度对待书本，不能以经验主义的态度对待知识。我们提倡敢想敢说敢做，是为了反对那种因循旧习、墨守成规的右倾保守思想，是为了做那些经过努力可以做到的事情，而不是硬做那些事实上办不到的事情。因此，破除迷信、解放思想、敢想敢说敢做，必须是在马克思列宁主义指导下进行，以党的方针政策为依据。我们对马克思列宁主义的理论和党的方针政策学得越多、越深，就越能破除迷信、解放思想。

    挤出时间来读书
    近来碰到一些同志，谈起来，总是叫工作忙，抽不出时间来读书。看来，读书和时间的矛盾，是需要解决一下才好。
    我们的工作，什么时候才可以不忙？是不是要一直等到不忙或不太忙的时候再去读书？
    我们干革命工作，要每日每时关心人民群众的思想、工作、生活、学习，关心群众的一切，事无巨细，都要经心，兢兢业业的干，才称得上是人民的好干部。所以，我们不是有闲，而是有忙，忙，乃是我们做一名革命干部的正常现象，若是我们一定要等到有闲的时候才去读书，岂不是实际上不准备去读书了？这个月说，下个月该有点空闲去读点书了吧！到了下个月照样是忙，于是懊恼一次，再下个月又照样再懊恼一次，书还是没有读成，如此恶性循环下去，时光走得很快，到底哪一天才能有读书的时间呢？
    我看，这很需要分析分析工作忙的原因。事情多，责任重，这是一方面。但是，也还有另外一方面。这就是：我们的知识不广，思想水平不高，看问题不深不准不透。于是，我们总是不能打开局面，取得主动，总是弄得忙忙碌碌。假使我们的知识更广一些，思想认识的水平更高一些，看问题看得更深更准一些，不是做起工作来就可以“游刃有余”，而且效果更好了吗？
    可是，知识怎么才能更广，思想水平怎么才能更高，看问题怎么才能更深、更准、更透呢？读书就是丰富知识、提高思想认识水平的一个极为重要的方面。何况我们干的是革命工作，这个革命工作是在马克思列宁主义的理论指导下进行的，如果我们连马克思列宁主义的书籍也不认真去读，连党的方针政策也不认真去研究，怎么能看得清方向，拿得定主意呢？我们的革命工作都是具体的，每一样革命工作，都需要有丰富的业务知识，如果我们对这方面的书也不去读一读，满足于作一个外行，怎么能不越忙越出错、越出错又越忙呢？如果我们为人民办事真正是有负责精神的，又怎能不为自己由于不读书或少读书而出了错或者延误了工作，而感到心里难过呢？
    工作忙是事实，而且今后还要忙下去；忙了容易出错，更需要读书。怎么办？只有忙里偷闲去多读点书。这意思，就是要挤出时间来读书。我们工作虽然很忙，但是有一个情况很值得我们注意。就是不管忙到什么程度，如果区里、县里、市里召集开会，开上个半天、一天，工作也还是进行了，而且做得也未必就差一些。到底奥妙何在？无非是被逼得去作了些安排，急其所急，重其所重，各各有人负责。可见，真要安排得好，并不是连读点书的时间也完全挤不出来的。当然，挤不出读书时间的例外情况也不是绝对没有，但每次为时不过几天，总不会天天如此。我们一天到晚，总不会每分钟每秒钟都在工作，中间总会有十分钟、一刻钟的空隙，定要在这样短短的空隙中读很多书，或者定要理解得很深刻，自然是困难的，不切实际的。但是，利用这短短的时间看它几行，启发自己的思想，活动一下脑筋，作为一种休息和享受，是办得到的。我看日积月累，总会有点收获的。更何况我们还有假日，还可早点起来或者迟一点睡，真是实心实意的想读书，这一点读书的时间总可挤得出来的。
