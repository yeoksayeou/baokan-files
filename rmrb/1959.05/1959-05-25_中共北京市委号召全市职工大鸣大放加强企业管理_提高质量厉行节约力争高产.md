Xinhua News Agency, 24th: The Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China convened a plenary meeting from May 18th to 22nd, with the central theme being to further promote a comprehensive and nationwide campaign for increased production and thrift in Beijing, mobilize all positive factors, and ensure the fulfillment and over-fulfillment of the 1959 national economic plan.

The meeting noted with satisfaction the great achievements made on the industrial front in the first four months of this year. Under the leadership of the Party, the broad masses of workers in Beijing actively discussed the leap forward plan, formulated measures to realize the plan, and launched a socialist labor competition of high output, high quality, and high efficiency, creating a mass movement of comparing with the advanced, learning from the advanced, and catching up with the advanced. At the same time, leadership was grasped early and tightly in the movement, focusing on quality while grasping output, focusing on variety while grasping output value, focusing on light industry (market arrangements) while grasping heavy industry, and grasping enterprise management while vigorously carrying out mass movements, and mobilizing the masses to overcome the difficulties of insufficient raw materials in every possible way. Therefore, the national plan was over-fulfilled in the first four months.

After summarizing the work of the previous stage, the meeting further analyzed the main problems in the current industrial production. Since last year's Great Leap Forward, a batch of newly built and expanded enterprises have been put into production, and the original enterprises have also added new equipment. Many enterprises have not only greatly increased their output but have also added many new products, some of which were not produced in the past, and some of which are technically complex products that could not be produced at all in the past. However, the current industrial technical level and management level are far from keeping up with the needs of rapid production development. Whether in newly built and expanded enterprises or in original enterprises, new workers account for a large proportion, and their ideological and technical training is not enough. The production management and technical management of some enterprises are still very backward. Therefore, the quality of many products is not high, not comparable to the advanced enterprises in the country, and some more complex new products have not yet passed the technical barrier. Although some attention has been paid to quality issues since the beginning of this year, many enterprises have not grasped it deeply and thoroughly. Therefore, improving product quality and striving for high output on the basis of improving quality has become a prominent issue in the current industrial production.

Improving quality, increasing output, and reducing costs must be combined with each other and make an all-round leap forward. However, at present, with the great increase in new enterprises, new workers, new equipment, and new products, if quality cannot keep up quickly, not only is there no guarantee of output, but also a great waste of human and material resources will be caused, and therefore costs cannot be reduced. This is not in line with the principle of more, faster, better, and more economical. Therefore, the central link of the current campaign for increasing production and practicing thrift is to strive to improve product quality so that industrial production can develop solidly forward.

Since last year's Great Leap Forward, the production and supply of raw materials and materials have greatly increased, but some still cannot fully meet the needs of rapid production development. The meeting believed that in addition to stepping up the crash production of raw materials and materials according to the plan, it is also necessary to vigorously tap potential, reduce the consumption of raw materials and materials, and make rational use of raw materials and materials. The meeting pointed out that on the one hand, the supply of certain raw materials and materials is insufficient, and on the other hand, the phenomenon of wasting raw materials and materials in some places is still quite serious. The meeting decided to organize a thorough inventory and rational allocation of raw materials and materials throughout the city under the unified leadership of the Municipal Party Committee; vigorously recycle waste materials in all factories, mines, enterprises, and construction sites; and at the same time, instruct all enterprises and units to take effective measures to reduce the consumption of raw materials and materials. The meeting especially required all key enterprises to vigorously practice thrift, "because they are marshals and pioneers, and are the key targets of guarantee, with strong support from all sides, and the use of raw materials is also large, which easily leads to complacency and waste."

The meeting also pointed out that improving product quality and reducing the consumption of raw materials and materials must be carried out simultaneously, and while saving raw materials and materials and using substitute materials, product quality must be guaranteed. Quality and conservation must be grasped simultaneously, and on this basis, output should be greatly increased.

The meeting believed that in order to achieve greater increases in production and conservation, it is necessary to vigorously strengthen the supporting work of products, especially the supporting work of mechanical and electrical products, reduce the backlog of semi-finished products, and increase the commodity output value of enterprises. The meeting also decided to strengthen the maintenance and repair of equipment, and would rather reduce the production of some products than resolutely take out a part of the production capacity and materials to arrange for equipment maintenance and the production of spare parts.

The meeting pointed out that the campaign for increased production and conservation must be a vigorous mass movement, and the Party organizations in the city must continue to summon up their energy and strive for the upper reaches. It is necessary to adopt the mass line method of great airing of views, great contention, and great debate, let go of mobilizing the masses, and vigorously carry out technical innovation and technical revolution. At the same time, combine the mass movement with centralized leadership, vigorously improve enterprise management, improve labor organization, establish and improve necessary rules and regulations, and conscientiously improve the management level of enterprises.

The meeting discussed the issue of industrial capital construction and summarized the experience of last year's Great Leap Forward in industrial construction from all aspects, such as industrial layout, the overall planning of factories, industrial design, the supporting of industrial equipment, and the principle of concentrating superior forces and carrying out batch assaults in industrial construction.

In order to ensure the continuous leap forward of industrial production, the meeting pointed out that for a batch of backbone factories that were newly built and expanded last year, such as Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company, Beijing Steel Plants, Jingxi Coal Mine, Beijing Steam Turbine Generator Factory, Beijing Forging Factory, First Machine Tool Factory, Changxindian Locomotive Factory, Nankou Parts Factory, etc., it is necessary to concentrate all the forces that can be mobilized in the city according to the principle of the whole country as a chess game, pool the wisdom of the masses, and accelerate construction, and strive to complete and put them into production as soon as possible while ensuring quality. The meeting also decided to conduct overall planning, adjustment, and reorganization of existing enterprises according to the needs of production and actual conditions, and considering the national cooperation relationship and the cooperation relationship in North China, so that each enterprise has a clear product direction and a relatively systematic cooperation relationship, in order to further develop productivity and vigorously overcome the critical weaknesses that can be overcome under the current conditions.

The meeting pointed out that the contingent of workers must be firmly rectified and trained. The number of new workers added to the industrial front in the city last year accounted for more than one-third of the total number of workers. Not only did they have no technology or very poor technology, but they also brought a large number of non-proletarian ideas. Therefore, it is necessary to carry out a "military training movement" to strengthen the political and ideological education and technical training of new workers, and gradually train them into a strong contingent of the working class with a high degree of ideological awareness, a high degree of organization and discipline, and a skillful mastery of modern technology. All enterprises and units should save labor and implement fixed staffing. Obey the unified allocation of labor.

The meeting pointed out that continuing to strengthen the Party's ideological and political leadership over enterprises is the fundamental guarantee for the successful development of the campaign for increased production and conservation. In enterprises, it is necessary to further implement the system of factory director responsibility under the leadership of the Party committee. While grasping production, the Party committee must also effectively grasp political and ideological work and Party affairs work, and not get caught up in daily administrative work. It is necessary to constantly educate Party members and workers with communist ideas. The meeting proposed that the current leaders at all levels should not only grasp the advanced but also make great efforts to grasp the backward. Some units did not thoroughly carry out rectification last year, and the relationship between leaders and the led needs to be further improved. Therefore, it is necessary for the municipal authorities and the district committees where they are located to send strong working groups to conduct make-up rectification and overcome the backward situation within a limited time.

After discussing the issue of the Party's work style, the meeting pointed out that it is necessary to constantly educate Party members and cadres to adhere to the Party's realistic and honest style. It is necessary to proceed from the actual situation, handle affairs according to the actual situation, and act in accordance with the Party's general line of going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results. The so-called plan must be implemented, that is, it must be implemented on the basis of going all out and aiming high, and never on the basis of right-leaning conservative ideas. In work, it is necessary to oppose both the dishonest style and the right-leaning conservative thinking that the lower the target, the better. Both the dishonest style and the right-leaning conservative thinking are not realistic and do not conform to the Party's general line of building socialism.

The meeting called on all Party members, League members, and all workers on the city's production front to continue to carry forward the communist style, strengthen collaboration and cooperation, twist into one rope from top to bottom, left and right, unify will, unify plans, and unify actions, carry out the campaign for increased production and conservation to the end, and use the positive actions of completing and over-completing the 1959 plan to welcome the tenth anniversary of the founding of the great motherland.

The meeting also discussed agricultural production and market issues.

Peng Zhen, First Secretary of the Municipal Party Committee, attended the meeting and delivered a speech. Liu Ren, Second Secretary of the Municipal Party Committee, made a concluding speech at the meeting.

The meeting was attended by all members and alternate members of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, and the Party member leading cadres of the relevant units also attended the meeting as non-voting delegates.

    中共北京市委号召全市职工大鸣大放加强企业管理
    提高质量厉行节约力争高产
    新华社24日讯　在北京市进一步开展全民的全面的增产节约运动，调动一切积极因素，保证完成和超额完成1959年国民经济计划，这是5月18日到22日中共北京市委全体会议的中心内容。
    会议满意地指出：今年头四个月在工业战线上获得了伟大的成就。北京的广大职工群众，在党的领导下，积极地讨论了跃进计划，并且制定实现计划的措施，开展了高产量、高质量、高效率的社会主义劳动竞赛，掀起了比先进，学先进，赶先进的群众运动。同时在运动的领导上，抓得早、抓得紧，在抓产量的同时抓质量，抓产值的同时抓品种，抓重工业的同时抓市场安排（轻工业），在大搞群众运动的同时，抓了企业的管理工作，并且发动群众千方百计地克服原材料不足的困难。因此头四个月都超额完成了国家计划。
    会议总结了前一阶段的工作以后，进一步分析了当前工业生产中的主要问题。去年以来，已经有一批新建和扩建的企业投入生产，原有的企业，也增添了新的设备。许多企业，不仅产量有很大增长，而且增加了许多新的产品，其中有些是过去没有生产过的产品，有些是过去根本不能生产的技术比较复杂的产品。但是当前工业的技术水平和管理水平还远远跟不上生产迅速发展的需要，不论新建和扩建的企业，或者原有的企业，新工人都占了很大比重，他们在思想上技术上的锻炼都还不够，有些企业的生产管理和技术管理还十分落后。因此，许多产品的质量还不高，比不上国内先进企业，有些比较复杂的新产品还没有过技术关。今年以来，虽然抓了一下质量问题，但是许多企业抓得不深不透。因此提高产品质量并在提高质量的基础上力争高产，就成了当前工业生产中的突出问题。
    提高质量，增加产量，降低成本，必须互相结合，全面跃进。但是目前在新企业、新工人、新设备、新产品都有了很大增长的情况下，如果质量不能迅速跟上，不仅产量没有保证，而且会在人力物力上造成很大的浪费，因而成本也不能降低，这样就不符合多快好省的原则。因此，当前增产节约运动的中心环节是努力提高产品质量，使工业生产巩固地向前发展。
    去年大跃进以来，原料、材料的生产和供应，都有很大的增长，但是有些还不能完全满足生产迅速发展的需要。会议认为，除了按照计划加紧突击原料和材料的生产以外，还必须大力挖掘潜力，降低原料和材料的消耗，合理地利用原料和材料。会议指出：现在一方面某些原料和材料供应不足，另方面有些地方浪费原料和材料的现象还相当严重。会议决定在全市范围内，在市委的统一领导下，对原料、材料有组织地进行彻底的清查和合理的调剂；在各厂矿企业和建筑工地上，大力回收废旧材料；同时责成所有的企业单位，采取有效措施，降低原料和材料的消耗。会议特别要求各重点企业大力厉行节约，“因为它们是元帅和先行，是重点保证的对象，各方面都大力支援，使用的原料材料也多，极易养尊处优，造成浪费”。
    会议还指出：提高产品质量和降低原料、材料的消耗必须同时并举，节约原料、材料和采用代用材料的同时，必须保证产品质量。质量和节约必须同时抓紧，并在这个基础上，大力增加产量。
    会议认为，为了实现更大的增产和节约，必须大力加强产品的配套工作，尤其是机械电机产品的配套工作，减少半成品的积压，提高企业的商品产值。会议还决定：加强设备的维护检修，宁可减少一些产品的生产，也要坚决拿出一部分生产能力和材料来安排设备维修和配件备件的生产。
    会议指出，增产节约运动必须是一个轰轰烈烈的群众运动，全市党的组织都要继续鼓足干劲，力争上游。必须采取大鸣大放大辩论的群众路线方法，放手发动群众，大闹技术革新和技术革命。同时，把群众运动和集中领导结合起来，大力改进企业管理，改善劳动组织，建立和健全必要的规章制度，认真地提高企业的管理水平。
    会议讨论了工业基本建设问题，并且从工业的布局，工厂的总体规划，工业设计，工业设备的配套，以及工业建设上集中优势力量、分批突击的方针等各方面总结了去年工业建设大跃进的经验。
  为了保证工业生产不断地跃进，会议指出：对于去年开始新建和扩建的一批骨干工厂，如石景山钢铁公司、北京各钢厂、京西煤矿、北京汽轮发电机厂、北京铸锻厂、第一机床厂、长辛店机车厂、南口配件厂等等，要根据全国一盘棋的方针，集中全市各方面可能调动的力量，群策群力，加紧建设，在保证质量的条件下争取尽快建成投入生产。会议还决定：对现有企业根据生产的需要和实际条件，并且考虑到全国性的协作关系和华北地区的协作关系，按行业按产品通盘规划，进行调整改组，使各个企业都有明确的产品方向，和比较系统的协作关系，以便进一步发挥生产力，大力克服当前条件下可能克服的关键性的薄弱环节。
    会议指出，对于职工队伍，必须抓紧整顿训练。去年全市工业战线上新增加的职工占全部工人总数的三分之一以上，他们不但没有技术或者技术很差，而且带来了大量非无产阶级思想。因此，要开展“练兵运动”，加强对新工人的政治思想教育和技术训练，逐渐把他们锻炼成为具有高度思想觉悟、高度组织性、纪律性和熟练地掌握现代技术的一支坚强的工人阶级队伍。所有的企业单位，都应当节约劳动力，实行定员。服从劳动力的统一调配。
    会议指出，继续加强党对企业的思想政治领导是胜利开展增产节约运动的根本保证。在企业中必须进一步贯彻党委领导下的厂长负责制，党委在抓生产的同时，必须把政治思想工作和党务工作也切实抓起来，而不要陷入日常的行政工作中去。要经常以共产主义思想教育党员和职工。会议提出，当前各级领导不但要抓先进、而且要用大力抓落后，有些单位去年整风不彻底，领导与被领导的关系还有进一步加以改善的必要，因此，必须由市级主管部门和所在区委派强有力的工作组，进行整风补课，限期克服落后局面。
    会议讨论了党的工作作风问题以后指出，必须经常教育党员和干部，坚持党的实事求是老老实实的作风。要从实际情况出发，按实际情况办事，按照党的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线办事。所谓计划要落实，就是要落实在鼓足干劲、力争上游的基础上，决不要落实在右倾保守思想的基础上。在工作中既要反对不老实的作风，也要反对那种认为指标越低越好的右倾保守思想。不老实的作风和右倾保守思想都不是实事求是，都不符合党的建设社会主义的总路线。
    会议要求全市生产战线上的全体党员、团员和全体职工，继续发扬共产主义风格，加强协作配合，上下左右拧成一股劲，统一意志，统一计划，统一行动，把增产节约运动进行到底，用完成和超额完成1959年计划的积极行动，来迎接伟大祖国的建国十周年。
    会议还讨论了农业生产和市场问题。
    市委第一书记彭真同志出席了会议，并讲了话。市委第二书记刘仁同志在会上作了总结发言。
    参加会议的有中共北京市委全体委员和候补委员，各有关单位的党员领导干部也列席了这次会议。
