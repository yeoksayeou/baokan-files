    Step辇图 (Bu Nian Tu)

  　The scroll painting "Step辇图" (Bu Nian Tu), painted on silk with colors, has been passed down through the ages as a genuine work of the great Tang Dynasty figure painter Yan Liben. Many inscriptions by Northern Song Dynasty figures appear after the painting, such as Mi Xiangyang, Huang Gongqi, Liu Cizhuang, and Zhang Woquan, along with a long inscription in seal script by the famous calligrapher Zhang Boyi of the time. According to expert appraisal, this painting is at least a faithful copy made by a painter in the early Northern Song Dynasty based on Yan Liben's original. This is the only surviving "Yan" painting in the country, and also the earliest historical painting related to Tibet.
    In the fifteenth year of Zhenguan (641 AD), Emperor Taizong of Tang allowed Princess Wencheng to marry the Tubo King Songtsen Gampo. Songtsen Gampo then sent his envoy Lu Dongzan to greet the princess. The painter depicted this reception scene. On one side is Emperor Taizong of Tang sitting on a "Step辇" (a type of litter), with six palace women carrying and supporting the seat. Two palace women hold fans, and one palace woman holds a red umbrella. On the other side: the person standing in front in a red robe with a gnarled beard is probably the official in charge of the ceremony at the time. The person in the middle, wearing national costume embroidered with animal patterns and cupping his hands in salute, should be the Tubo envoy Lu Dongzan. The person in white behind him is probably the translator.
    Yan Liben was the Zhujue Langzhong (an official title) of Emperor Taizong of Tang and had painted portraits for Taizong. Taizong often summoned Yan to paint during major events or banquets. This painting was likely a depiction of the time, with vivid figures and realistic scenes. It records an important historical fact from 1300 years ago, and it serves as a testament to the many beautiful and moving stories of Princess Wencheng that still circulate in Tibet today.
    This painting will be exhibited at the Beijing History Museum in October this year.

    步辇图
    王冶秋
  　“步辇图”一卷，绢地彩绘，历代相传为唐代伟大的人物画家阎立本真迹，画后多为北宋人题跋，如米襄阳，黄公器，刘次庄，张偓佺等人，并有当时著名书法家章伯益篆文长跋。现据专家鉴定，这幅画至迟是北宋初年画家根据阎立本的原本而忠实临绘的。这是国内仅存的一幅“阎”画，也是有关西藏的最早的一幅历史画。
    贞观十五年（公元641年），唐太宗允许把文成公主嫁给吐蕃王松赞干布，于是松赞干布派了使者禄车赞来迎公主，画家正是描绘了这个接见场面。一侧是唐太宗坐着“步辇”，六位宫女肩负和扶持着这个坐具，两位宫女掌着扇，一位宫女持着红色伞盖；一侧是：站在前面红袍虬髯的可能是当时的典礼官员，中间一位穿着民族服装，绣着动物花纹，拱手致敬的，当是吐蕃的使者禄车赞，后面一位白衣人，可能是译员。
    阎立本是唐太宗的主爵郎中，曾为太宗画过肖像。太宗遇有重大事件或游宴的时候，常常召阎去画画。这幅画当是当时的描绘，人物生动，情景逼真，它记录了一千三百年前的一段重要史实，它为至今还在西藏流传的文成公主许多美丽动人的故事作了见证。
    这幅画将在今年10月份在北京历史博物馆展出。
