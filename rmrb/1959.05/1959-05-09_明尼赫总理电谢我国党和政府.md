Xinhua News Agency, 8th. Premier Münnich Ferenc cabled the CPC Central Committee and our government yesterday on his departure from our country's territory, on behalf of the Hungarian Party and Government Delegation. The cable reads as follows:

To the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China,
The Government of the People's Republic of China,
Dear Comrades:

Please allow me, on behalf of our delegation as we depart the territory of China, to once again thank you for your warm invitation and truly comradely hospitality.

Our visit to China has given the entire delegation the opportunity to learn much and the experiences are rich. We will convey what we have learned and our experiences to the Hungarian working people.

We are deeply convinced that this visit, the talks, and the Treaty of Friendship and Cooperation signed between our two countries will further strengthen the already existing fraternal ties between the peoples, parties, and governments of our two countries. This will help to further strengthen the unity of the entire socialist camp.

We wish the great Chinese people, the Communist Party of China and the leaders of the Government of the People's Republic of China good health, and wish them many achievements in socialist construction!

Dr. Münnich Ferenc
Prime Minister of the Hungarian Workers' and Peasants' Revolutionary Government,
On behalf of the Hungarian Party and Government Delegation
May 7, 1959

　　明尼赫总理电谢我国党和政府
    新华社8日讯　明尼赫·费伦茨总理昨天在离开我国国土的时候，代表匈牙利党政代表团致电中共中央和我国政府。电文如下：中国共产党中央委员会中华人民共和国政府亲爱的同志们：
    请允许我在离开中国国土的时候代表我们的代表团再一次感谢你们热情的邀请和真正同志般的殷勤款待。
    我们在中国的访问使整个代表团有机会学到许多东西，体验是很丰富的。我们将把学到的这些东西和我们的体验转达给匈牙利劳动人民。
    我们深信，我们这次的访问、会谈和我们两国之间签订的友好合作条约更进一步密切了我们两国人民、两国党和政府之间早已存在的兄弟般的联系。这是有助于进一步加强整个社会主义阵营的团结的。
    我们祝伟大的中国人民，中国共产党和中华人民共和国政府的领导人身体健康，并且祝他们在社会主义建设中获得很多成就！
