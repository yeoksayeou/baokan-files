According to Fujian Daily: Fujian Province's battle to seize a great summer harvest has entered a tense stage. In recent days, the field management army has divided into countless professional teams, fighting in the green sea of rice, skillfully applying fine fertilizer, rationally irrigating, preventing disasters, and striving for early rice with large ears and many grains.

At the beginning of May, after the early rice transplanting was basically completed throughout the province, various localities immediately concentrated their efforts to carry out a field management campaign centered on accumulating fertilizer and topdressing. They greatly broke the tillering and panicle competition barrier, and the effective tillering of most rice fields has increased to varying degrees. According to surveys of Pingzhai Brigade of Shange Commune in Pinghe, representing the plains, and Chencang Commune in Changtai, representing the mountainous areas, each mu generally has more than 300,000 panicles, the rice is two to three feet tall, and the growth is good.

In order to seize the opportunity and attack the barrier of large ears and many grains, various localities have launched a campaign to make and apply fine fertilizer and a campaign to apply topdressing in a concentrated manner. In the Jinjiang area alone, five counties including Putian and Nan'an mobilized more than 370,000 people to accumulate fertilizer, accumulating more than one million dan of fine fertilizer daily. In order to apply panicle fertilizer in a timely manner, various localities rushed to send all fertilizers to the fields. In Xiamen City, on the front line of coastal defense, more than 25,000 workers, cadres of government agencies, residents, and students were mobilized to carry out a ten-day campaign to accumulate and deliver fertilizer, sending more than 35,000 dan of fine fertilizer to farmers in the suburbs. Nan'an County launched a "clearing fertilizer" campaign, clearing all fine fertilizer to the fields. In the past few days, it has cleared out more than 2.2 million dan of quick-acting native miscellaneous fertilizer and more than 1.7 million jin of soil fertilizer, ammonia water, and arsenic fertilizer for applying panicle fertilizer to early rice. Qiaodong Commune in Zhao'an concentrated more than 9,000 people to apply topdressing in a concentrated manner. Commune members of Xishen Brigade carried burdens on their shoulders and never went out empty-handed, applying fertilizer to more than 200 mu of land every day. The rice seedlings in various localities that have been applied with panicle fertilizer are growing stronger and more luxuriantly.

Attacking the barrier of large ears and many grains requires more detailed and careful field management work. Therefore, various localities have selected experienced old farmers and young and strong commune members to organize professional teams responsible for field management. Gutian County organized more than 4,000 field management professional teams, implementing responsibility to each person, and the early rice management was very meticulous. After strengthening the management of 14% of the county's third-class seedlings, half of them have been upgraded. The field management professional team of Anhua Commune in Pinghe, after overcoming the tillering barrier, immediately launched a disaster prevention and seedling protection campaign, rushing to repair more than 60 reservoirs, ponds, canals, and dams, and implemented rational irrigation, making the rice seedlings have thick stems and strong leaves.

After strengthening field management in various localities, most of the early rice seedlings are growing vigorously, and some are growing even better than last year. According to a survey of more than 3.5 million mu of rice seedlings, the first and second-class seedlings account for 87.5%, and the third-class seedlings account for 12.5%. At present, various localities are continuing to vigorously accumulate fertilizer, especially quick-acting fertilizer, to meet the needs of topdressing in rice fields.

    福建田间管理大军巧施肥水
    紧催早稻穗大粒多
    据福建日报消息  福建省夺取夏季大丰收的战斗已进入紧张阶段，连日来，田间管理大军分成无数的专业队，奋战在绿色的稻海里，巧施精肥，合理灌溉，防灾保健，力争早稻穗大粒多。
    5月初，全省早稻插秧基本结束后，各地立即集中力量开展以积肥和追肥为中心的田间管理运动，大破分蘖争穗关，大部分稻田的有效分蘖都有不同程度的增加，季节较早的闽南等地的早稻已转入了圆秆拔节孕穗期。据代表平原的平和山格公社平寨大队和代表山区的长泰陈苍公社调查：每亩分蘖一般在三十万穗以上，稻高二三尺，生长良好。
    为了抓住火候，攻打穗大粒多关，各地都开展了突击积制精肥和突击追肥的运动。晋江专区仅莆田、南安等五县就出动三十七万多人积肥，日积精肥一百多万担。为了及时施穗肥，各地都把所有肥料突击送下田。在海防前线的厦门市，出动了二万五千多工人、机关干部、居民、学生，开展十天突击积肥、送肥运动，把三万五千多担精肥送给了市郊农民。南靖县开展了“清肥”运动，把所有的精肥清下田去，几天来已清出二百二十多万担速效性土杂肥，一百七十多万斤土化肥、氨水和砒肥，为早稻施了穗肥。诏安桥东公社集中了九千多人突击追肥，西沈大队社员担不离肩，出门不空手，每天施肥二百多亩。各地施过穗肥的禾苗，长得更壮更旺。
    攻打穗大粒多关，田间管理工作需要更细致、更认真，因此各地都选了有经验的老农和年青力壮的社员组织专业队，负责田间管理。古田县组织了四千多个田间管理专业队，实行责任到人，早稻管理得十分细致。全县占14％的三类苗，加强管理后已有一半升了级。平和安厚公社的田间管理专业队，攻下分蘖关后，立刻开展防灾保苗运动，突击抢修了六十多处水库、池塘、水圳、水坝，并且实行合理灌水，使禾苗秆粗叶壮。
    各地加强田间管理后，大部分早稻禾苗生长健壮，一部分比去年的还长得好。据调查的三百五十多万亩禾苗中，一二类苗占87.5％，三类苗占12.5％。目前，各地正在继续大力积肥，特别是速效肥，以满足稻田追肥的需要。
