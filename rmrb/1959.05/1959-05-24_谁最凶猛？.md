	Who is the Fiercest?
	Liu Xiang
	A leopard sees a pig, bites it to death, eats it, very decisively. But who wins when a leopard fights a python?
	Someone once saw a leopard encounter a large python, one or two *zhang* in length. The python coiled around the tree very agilely, and the leopard's leaping and maneuvering skills were of no use. Suddenly, the python rushed down from the tree and wrapped itself around the leopard's waist and neck, then tightened, tightened, until it strangled the leopard to death. Before the leopard's flesh hardened, it began to eat heartily.
	The pit viper in the Yangtze River area of China, although only two feet long, is a very venomous snake. When it encounters other animals, it raises its tail, holds its head high, hisses and threatens, or takes the opportunity to bite the opponent to death. But when it encounters the "rarely confused" pig, its skills are useless. The pig finds this performance very interesting, so it walks closer, closer, and bites the viper's head in one bite. By the time the viper realizes that a great disaster is imminent, it has already become a delicious snack for the pig.

    谁最凶猛？
    刘祥
    豹子看见了猪，一口咬死，吃掉，干脆得很。可是豹子和蟒蛇打仗，你猜是谁战胜谁呢？　　曾经有人看见，一只豹子碰到了一条身长一两丈的大蟒蛇。蟒蛇非常灵活地在树上蟠绕着，豹子的扑跃腾挪的本领简直无所施其技。突然，蟒蛇从树上冲下来，一下卷在豹子的腰部、颈部，然后缠紧，缠紧，直到把豹子缠死。趁着豹子肉还没有僵硬，便大吃而特吃起来。
    我国长江一带的蝮蛇，虽然只有两尺多长，可是是一种很毒的蛇。碰到别的动物，它就把尾巴翘起来，头抬得很高，呼呼喷气，进行威胁，或者乘机将对方咬死。可是当它碰到“难得糊涂”的猪的时候，也无所施其技，猪看到它这一套表演，觉得很有趣，便走近去，走近去，一口就把蝮蛇的头咬住了。等到蝮蛇发觉大祸临头的时候已经变成了猪的可口的点心了。
