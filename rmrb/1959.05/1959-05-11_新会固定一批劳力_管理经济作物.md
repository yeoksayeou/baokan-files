Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 9th: While focusing on the field management of paddy rice, Xin Hui County is vigorously strengthening the field management of economic crops, including intertillage, topdressing, and pest control.

Xin Hui County sowed more than 200,000 mu of economic crops this spring. After sowing, each commune fixed a batch of labor to be specifically responsible for the field management of economic crops. Recently, the county also organized more than 40,000 people to conduct a comprehensive inspection and comparison of economic crops, taking production brigades as units. The Xin Hui County Party Committee also organized thirteen working groups to conduct roving inspections in economic crop areas. The county's competent departments separately convened on-site meetings for economic crops such as peanuts, sugarcane, and jute, requesting all localities to firmly grasp the topdressing and pest control of economic crops. After the meetings, people's communes generally planned to build a large fertilizer pool for every 30 to 50 mu of land to implement field-edge composting. The county's sixty-plus pesticide factories have recently produced more than 10,000 dan of various pesticides.

    新会固定一批劳力
    管理经济作物
    新华社广州9日电　新会县在抓好水稻田间管理的同时，大力加强经济作物的中耕、追肥、除虫等田间管理工作。
    新会县今春播种经济作物二十多万亩，播种结束后，各公社都固定了一批劳动力，专门负责经济作物的田间管理工作，最近全县还组织了四万多人，以生产大队为单位，对经济作物进行一次全面的检查评比。中共新会县委也组织了十三个工作组，到经济作物区进行巡回检查。县主管部门分别召开了花生、甘蔗、黄麻等经济作物现场会议，要求各地抓紧经济作物的追肥、防虫工作。会后，各人民公社普遍计划在每三十至五十亩的田造一个大沤肥池，实行田头沤肥；全县六十多个农药厂最近已制出各种农药一万多担。
