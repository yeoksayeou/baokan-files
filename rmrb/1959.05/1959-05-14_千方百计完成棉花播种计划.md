    Do Everything Possible to Complete the Cotton Planting Plan
    This year, all regions have been grasping cotton planting work earlier and better than in previous years. Therefore, most cotton fields have met the requirements of level ground, sufficient moisture, and adequate fertilizer. Cotton planted before Grain Rain has generally sprouted in more than 60-70% of the fields. The planned large-area high-yield cotton fields in various regions (nationwide, approximately 25 to 30 million mu) have even more uniformly sprouted and are growing robustly, green and lush, pleasing to the eye.
    However, the implementation of cotton field planting area plans is not uniformly good everywhere. Currently, more than 15% of cotton fields nationwide have not yet been planted. There are many objective reasons for not completing the planting plan, such as increased wheat density in the Yangtze River basin, making intercropping with cotton difficult; earlier periods with more rain, affecting the progress of cotton planting; and in the cotton-producing provinces of the Yellow River basin, after planting reached over 90%, people's attention gradually shifted to cotton field management, and so on. However, as long as subjective efforts are strengthened, the cotton planting plan can still be completed. For example, Siyang in Jiangsu, Chaoxian in Anhui, and Tianmen in Hubei, which are also located in the rainy south, used methods such as seedling cultivation and transplantation to complete the planting plan by the end of April. Another example is Shulu County in Hebei Province, which not only completed the planting plan for 800,000 mu of cotton fields in a timely manner but also universally inspected seedlings for replanting and carried out field management work in early-planted cotton fields by the end of April. So, where is the problem? The problem is that many people believe that planting more or less does not matter much, and as long as the yield per unit area is increased, the cotton production increase plan can still be achieved. This statement is obviously incorrect. Without sufficient area, the realization of cotton production increase targets cannot be ensured. Calculated with 100 million mu, an average yield of 100 jin of ginned cotton per mu is required to complete the target of producing 100 million dan of ginned cotton; calculated with 90 million mu, the yield per mu must be increased to 110 jin. The smaller the area, the higher the yield per unit area is required. However, under current conditions, there is a certain limit to increasing the yield per unit area. Failure to complete the total planting area plan will create great difficulties in completing the total output plan. Only by planting according to the original planned area or even a slightly larger area is a more realistic and stable approach. Therefore, the cotton planting area cannot be reduced. If the masses cannot understand this point for a while, the reasons should be explained to them. If the masses agree, but there is simply not enough land, this is easy to solve. In addition to intercropping as much as possible, a portion of spring fallow land can also be used for planting. Nantong and Suzhou prefectures in Jiangsu Province are using spring fallow land to complete the cotton planting plan. If the planting area still cannot reach the originally planned area, square seedling cultivation and nutrient pot (block) seedling cultivation can also be carried out to facilitate transplantation after the wheat harvest. These methods can be adopted by both the north and the south, adapting to local conditions.
    Field management of already planted cotton fields should also be strengthened to ensure that every mu planted is harvested. Broken rows and missing seedlings should be replanted as soon as possible. It may seem "insignificant" for a few broken rows and missing seedlings in a mu of land; however, each county and each commune might as well calculate, if all the broken rows and missing seedlings are added up, wouldn't it also be equivalent to reducing a large planting area?

### 千方百计完成棉花播种计划

    千方百计完成棉花播种计划
    今年各地对棉花播种工作都比往年抓得早，抓得好。因此，大部棉田达到了地平、墒饱、肥足的要求。谷雨前播种的棉花，已普遍出苗六七成以上。各地所规划的大面积丰产棉田（全国约有二千五百万到三千万亩），棉苗更是出得整齐、长得茁壮，绿油油的，逗人喜爱。
    但是，棉田播种面积计划的执行情况并不是处处都很好。目前全国还有15％以上的棉田没有播种。没有完成播种计划的客观原因固然很多，如长江流域麦子密度加大，套种棉花有困难；前期雨水又较多，影响了棉花播种进度；黄河流域各产棉省播种达到90％以上后，人们的注意力逐渐转移到棉田管理上去了等等。但是，只要加强主观努力，棉花播种计划还是可以完成的。如同样处在南方多雨情况下的江苏泗阳、安徽巢县、湖北天门等县，采用育苗移栽等办法，4月底就完成了播种计划。又如河北省束鹿县八十万亩棉田，既及时完成了播种计划，又在4月底，就对早播棉田普遍进行了查苗补种和田间管理工作。那么问题在哪里呢？问题在于有不少人认为种多种少没有多大关系，只要提高单位面积产量，同样可以实现棉花增产计划。这种说法显然是不对的。没有足够的面积就不能确保棉花增产指标的实现。以一亿亩来计算，平均亩产皮棉一百斤，才可以完成生产皮棉一亿担的指标：以九千万亩来计算，亩产就要提高到一百一十斤才行。面积愈少，单位面积产量就要求得愈高。可是，在目前条件下，提高单位面积产量是有一定限度的。播种总面积计划不能完成，就会给总产量计划的完成造成很大的困难。只有按原计划面积或更多一点面积播种，才是更现实更稳妥的做法。因此，棉花播种面积不能减少。如果群众对于这点一时想不通，就应该向群众说清道理。如果群众同意了，而只是土地不够，这好解决。除了尽量套种以外，还可以利用一部分春白地播种。江苏省南通、苏州两专区正在利用春白地完成棉花播种计划。如果播种面积仍不能达原订的计划，还可以搞方格育苗和营养钵（块）育苗，以便在麦收后移栽。这些办法，北方或南方，都可以因地制宜地采用。
    对已经播种的棉田也要加强田间管理，保证种一亩，收一亩。断条缺苗，应该尽快补起来。看起来一亩地里断一些条、缺一些苗似乎“无足轻重”；可是，每县、每个公社不妨计算一下，如果把所有的断条缺苗加起来，不也等于减少了很大的播种面积吗？
