Chairman, fellow representatives:
    I fully endorse all the reports of the congress. I am a tunneling worker from the Jixi Coal Mine in Heilongjiang Province. I would like to report to the congress on the rapid tunneling method of the "May 1st" Tunneling Team of Jixi Coal Mine.

    The "May 1st" Tunneling Team will never be a stumbling block to the leap forward in coal production
    Tunneling work is the pioneer of coal mining. Only by speeding up the tunneling work can we prepare the conditions for a large amount of coal production for the mining work. In the past few years, with the increase in the progress of coal mining, tunneling work has also made great progress. However, in terms of the proportion of development, tunneling is still lagging behind mining and cannot keep up with the needs of mining. Especially when the whole people are engaged in large-scale steel production and a large amount of coke is needed, the coal mining work has also made a great leap forward. The workers have fully utilized the role of mechanization. In the past, the monthly progress of mechanized coal mining was 50 to 60 meters, and now it averages 80 to 100 meters per month. However, the monthly progress of tunneling work is only 40 to 60 meters. This raises a question for our tunneling work. If tunneling work does not leap forward, or lags behind, it will hinder the entire leap forward in coal production and also hinder the leap forward in steel production. Can our tunneling work make a leap forward? This is a question that everyone is concerned about. When we took this question to the masses for debate, some people initially expressed a lack of confidence, fearing that a failed leap forward would affect the workers' production morale. Others emphasized the poor equipment, insufficient supply of materials, and the lack of a rock loading machine, making manual pushing of carts unfeasible. However, through debate, our awareness was greatly enhanced. We recognized the important significance of coal production to industrial production. Everyone said: We must make a leap forward. We will never be a stumbling block in the leap forward in coal production. We must change the situation where tunneling lags behind coal mining production and adapt to the needs of mechanized coal mining. We must be pioneers. Therefore, our "May 1st" Tunneling Team began to study how to carry out rapid tunneling. We first analyzed the reasons why the progress was not fast. In the past, we mainly followed the work procedures of drilling holes, blasting, supporting, and transporting rocks and coal one by one in sequence. Naturally, the progress was very slow. After we visited and learned from the advanced tunneling teams such as 4301 and 640 in the mining area, we first studied and improved the labor organization and implemented parallel and cross-operations, using multiple electric drills and pneumatic drills to drill holes. After this improvement, the labor efficiency was greatly improved. However, due to the failure to improve the lifting capacity accordingly, the carts filled with rocks and coal could not be transported out, and the empty carts could not be sent down, affecting the development of the work. The workers could not exert their strength. At this time, the Party committee convened a technical research meeting of cadres, technicians, and workers, and brought into play the spirit of daring to think and daring to act, and improved the transportation method. A cart yard was opened 70 meters away from the winch track to store empty carts. After the cart was filled, the empty cart was first pushed to the working face, and then the full cart was transported out of the well. Then, in terms of operating technology, the drilling method was improved. In the past, the bottom holes were drilled first, which was slow due to the large amount of water. Later, it was changed to drilling the waist holes first, which greatly accelerated the work progress.

    Improve tunneling technology, accelerate tunneling speed, and ensure normal coal mining
    After this series of improvements, the tunneling speed has been significantly improved. For example, for tunneling inclined shafts, the daily progress used to be only one to two meters, and now the average daily progress can reach more than ten meters, increasing efficiency by five to six times. In the inclined shaft winch lane with a semi-coal and rock section of 7.2 square meters and a height of 2.4 meters, 263 meters were completed in just 25 days, creating a new record unprecedented in the entire bureau. Those who were originally not confident in the leap forward also increased their confidence, and those who doubted no longer doubted. However, the situation of tight materials, equipment, and transportation appeared again. The outstanding problem in the tunneling work was the shortage of small tools. How to solve the problem of insufficient materials and equipment? In addition to strictly practicing economy, the entire staff was mobilized to find ways to regenerate themselves, and the staff and their families were mobilized to establish the idea of "taking the mine as home," collecting scattered equipment and materials to support production. For example, if the leg wire of the detonator was short, the workers used the recycled old wire to connect it. The transportation capacity was insufficient, and materials could not be transported up. After discussion by the masses, every day before work, pit wood was carried and iron rails were lifted from places as far as three miles away from the wellhead, exerting a soaring energy, saving three to four horse-drawn carts every day, ensuring the normal progress of coal mining and tunneling work in the severe situation of insufficient vehicles. In winter, the newly tunneled wellhead had no heating equipment, and there was water on the working face, freezing more than 30 cart bottoms, affecting the tunneling work. The leader issued a big-character poster soliciting solutions. After our team snatched this big-character poster, after everyone discussed it, they unanimously proposed "dedicating labor to chisel the cart bottoms." So they mustered their energy and chiseled them all out in just one day.

    Thanks to these creations and improvements, the staff, under the battle call of "taking steel as the key link and coal as the guarantee," mustered soaring energy. Although half of our "May 1st" Tunneling Team were new workers, they completed the annual plan two months ahead of schedule last year. On this basis, in the first quarter of this year, in terms of major roadway tunneling, they completed the tunneling plan for the first quarter 20 days ahead of schedule and overfulfilled the state plan by 150 meters. The tunneling progress in the Jixi mining area in the first quarter of this year increased by 69.3% compared with the same period last year. This fact fully shows that as long as we fully mobilize the masses and rely on the masses under the leadership of the Party, there are no difficulties that cannot be overcome and no problems that cannot be solved.

    Achieve higher speed and strive for greater victory
    This year's leap forward plan for our "May 1st" Tunneling Team is to tunnel 3,280 meters, which is almost double that of last year. It is recognized that completing such an arduous task with the existing personnel and equipment conditions will involve many difficulties. However, all of our team members are determined to further promote the spirit of combining hard work and ingenuity under the leadership of the Party in the extraordinary year of 1959. On the basis of the victory in the first quarter, we will achieve higher speed and strive for greater victory. Not only do we have soaring energy, but we also vigorously carry out technological innovation and promote advanced experience. In particular, our work is still far behind the advanced tunneling teams and groups in coal mines across the country. Therefore, we must learn with an open mind and have formulated a high-speed tunneling plan. In the tunneling of double-track main roadways, we will reach a monthly progress of 500 meters in April. Advanced experiences such as deep-hole blasting and four-shift cross-operation have been implemented. In daily management work, a normal working system has been established. In addition to the daily, ten-day, monthly, and quarterly plans, we have also formulated a plan for the current shift by the masses at the red flag competition meeting before work through the red flag competition campaign, and checked the completion status at the closing meeting, which has strengthened the collaborative relationship between shifts and between types of work. Facts have proved that the masses themselves make plans, the indicators are advanced, and they can guarantee completion. In addition, the participation of cadres in labor and timely assistance in discovering and solving key problems has also greatly encouraged the workers' labor enthusiasm. All of these are a powerful guarantee for us to complete the task and increase the tunneling speed. Therefore, every worker is full of energy, learning from the advanced and catching up with the advanced in the competition, not wasting a minute, demanding progress from every minute and every second, and everyone's heart is filled with the happy wish: "Create new achievements and strive to go to Beijing." Our "May 1st" Tunneling Team is determined to greet the 10th anniversary of the National Day with practical actions to create greater tunneling speed.

    Finally, I wish all the representatives good health.

    向每一分每一秒钟要进度
    崔国山代表的发言主席、各位代表：
    我完全拥护大会的各项报告。我是黑龙江省鸡西煤矿的一个掘进工，现将鸡西煤矿“五一”掘进队的快速掘进法向大会作一汇报。
    “五一”掘进队绝不当煤炭生产跃进的绊脚石
    掘进工作是采煤的先锋，只有掘进工作加快速度，才能给采煤工作准备好大量出煤的条件。几年来随着采煤进度的提高，掘进工作也有很大的进展，但是就发展的比例来看，掘进仍然落后于采煤，赶不上采煤的需要。特别是在全民大搞钢铁，需要大量焦炭的时候，采煤工作也来了个大跃进，工人们充分发挥了机械化的作用，过去机械化采煤月进度是五十公尺到六十公尺，现在平均达到月进度八十公尺到一百公尺，而掘进工作月进度只达四十公尺到六十公尺，这就给我们的掘进工作提出了一个问题，如果掘进工作不跃进，或者是落后，就妨碍了整个煤炭生产的跃进，也妨碍了钢铁生产的跃进。我们掘进工作到底能不能跃进？这是大家都关心的问题，当我们把这个问题拿到群众中去辩论的时候，开始有人表现信心不足，怕跃进不成影响工人的生产情绪，也有人强调设备差，供应材料不够，装岩没有装岩机，靠人力推车不行等等。但是通过辩论，大大的提高了我们的觉悟，认清了煤炭生产对工业生产的重要意义，大家说：我们一定得跃进，我们绝不当煤炭生产跃进中的绊脚石，一定要改变掘进落后于采煤生产的局面，适应机械化采煤的需要，我们一定要当先锋。于是我们“五一”掘进队就开始研究如何进行快速掘进？我们首先分析进度不快的原因在那里？过去主要是按打眼、放炮、支架、装运岩石和煤的工作程序一项项的顺着次序干。这样进度自然是很慢的，经我们到矿区先进的四三○一、六四○等掘进队参观学习后，首先研究改进了劳动组织，实行了平行交叉作业，改用多台电钻和风钻打眼。这样改进后，劳动效率大大提高了。但是，由于提升能力未能相适应的提高，装满岩石和煤的车运不出去，空车送不下来，影响工作的开展，工人有劲使不上。这时党委召开了干部、技术员，工人的技术研究会，发挥了敢想敢干的精神，又改进了运输方法。在绞车道七十公尺的地方，开一个车场子，存放空车，当车装满后，先将空车捣送到工作面，再将饱车运到井外。接着在操作技术上，改进了打眼方法，过去是先打底眼，因水大打的慢，后研究改为先打腰眼，大大加快了工作进度。
    改进掘进技术，加快掘进速度，保证采煤正常进行
    经过这一系列的改进以后，掘进速度有了显著提高，如掘凿斜井井筒，过去仅日进一公尺到二公尺，现在平均日进可达十公尺以上，提高效率五至六倍。在半煤岩断面七点二平方公尺和高二点四公尺的斜井绞车道里，仅二十五天中就完成了二百六十三公尺，创造了全局未有的新纪录。原来对跃进信心不足的也增强了信心，怀疑的人也不再怀疑了。但又出现了材料设备和运输紧张的情况，在掘进工作上，突出的问题是小型工具不足，怎样解决材料设备不足的问题呢？除厉行节约外，发动了全体职工想办法自力更生，发动职工和家属，树立“以矿为家”的思想，收集零散器材，支援生产。如雷管脚线短，工人就利用回收的旧线接起来使用。运输力不足材料运不上来，经过群众讨论，每天在上班前，从离井口远达三里的地方扛坑木，抬铁轨，运到井口，发挥了冲天干劲，每天节省三至四台马车，在车辆不足的严重情况下，保证了采煤掘进工作的正常进行。在冬季，新掘进的井口，没有取暖设备，工作面有水，冻住了三十多个车底，影响掘进工作不能进行。领导出了一张大字报，征求解决的办法。我们队把这张大字报抢来以后，经大家讨论，一致提出“献工刨车底”。于是鼓足了干劲，仅一天就全部刨出。
    由于以上这些创造与改进，职工们在“以钢为纲，以煤保纲”的战斗号召下，鼓起了冲天干劲。虽然我们“五一”掘进队，有一半的新工人，而去年却提前两个月完成了全年计划。在此基础上，今年第一季度，在主要巷道掘进方面又提前二十天完成了第一季度的掘进计划，并超额一百五十公尺完成国家计划。鸡西矿区今年第一季度掘进进度比去年同期提高百分之六十九点三。通过这一事实，充分地说明了，只要在党的领导下，充分发动群众，依靠群众，没有克服不了的困难，没有解决不了的问题。
    实现更高速度，争取更大胜利
    今年我们“五一”掘进队的跃进规划，是掘进三千二百八十公尺，比去年几乎翻了一番。在原有的人员设备的条件下，完成这样艰巨的任务，虽有很多困难，但是，我们全体队员，决心在不平凡的一九五九年里，在党的领导下，更进一步地发扬苦干与巧干相结合的精神，在第一季度胜利的基础上，实现更高的速度，争取更大的胜利。我们不但有冲天的干劲，而且大力开展技术革新，推广先进经验。特别是我们的工作和全国各煤矿的先进掘进队、组比较，还相差很远。因此，我们要虚心学习，并已制订了高速掘进规划。在双道大巷掘进中，四月份将达到月进五百公尺。已在推行了深孔爆破、四班交叉作业等先进经验。在日常管理工作上，建立起正常的工作制度，除订有按日、旬、月、季的计划外，并通过红旗竞赛运动，在上班前誓夺红旗竞赛会上，按班由群众制订当班的计划，并在收工会上检查完成情况，密切了班与班、工种与工种之间的协作关系。事实证明，群众自己订计划，指标既先进，而又能保证完成。此外，由于干部参加劳动，及时帮助发现和解决关键问题，也大大鼓舞了工人的劳动热情。所有这些，都是我们完成任务提高掘进速度的有力保证。因此，工人们个个干劲冲天，在竞赛中学先进赶先进，不浪费一分钟，向每一分每一秒钟要进度，每个人的内心里，充满了幸福的愿望：“创造新成绩，争取上北京”。我们“五一”掘进队决心以创造更大的掘进速度的实际行动来迎接国庆十周年。
    最后祝各位代表身体健康。
