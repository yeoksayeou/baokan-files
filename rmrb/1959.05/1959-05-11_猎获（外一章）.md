    Hunting (Plus One Chapter)
    Ru Yun
    The old hunter, riding a chestnut horse, galloped onto a hilltop. He reined in his horse and scanned the vast wilderness before him with his binoculars.

    Through the lens, he spotted a herd of wild oxen moving from a stretch of Gobi desert towards a grassy plain. The old hunter felt a surge of excitement; he was confident in his infallible marksmanship. In his mind's eye, he could already see the game falling to his shot. He imagined a pot of braised wild beef gracing the exploration team's dinner table…

    He straddled the bareback chestnut horse and let out a sharp whistle. The horse, like an arrow shot from a bowstring, galloped forward.

    The old hunter circled behind the herd of wild oxen, concealing the chestnut horse in a thicket of tamarisk trees. Then, holding his rifle, he lay in wait beside a tamarisk bush, watching the herd.

    He aimed, and in a moment, a flash of fire, a gunshot. The silent wilderness, like a pond into which a boulder had been thrown, shook violently with the sound. The herd of wild oxen scattered. The last one, unexpectedly, had not been fatally wounded—it fled with the herd.

    The old hunter mounted his tall horse and spurred it after his prey.

    The wounded wild ox ran frantically for its life.

    The old hunter pursued relentlessly, determined not to let go of the prize that was almost his, determined to slaughter the beast with his own hands.

    The wild ox ran into the mountains, and the hunter followed.

    The wild ox seemed to be playing hide-and-seek with the hunter: it crossed one ridge, then disappeared behind another.

    The old hunter cursed crudely as he continued his relentless pursuit. Now, he was surrounded by unfamiliar mountains.

    He was about to catch up. But suddenly, the chestnut horse began to slow its pace. The old hunter tumbled off the horse, kicked at the black stones on the ground with his boots, and picked up piece after piece of shiny, black stones, examining them closely…

    The old hunter thought of the geological team leader, who had told him in the hunter's yurt that these black stones were called coal.

    The old hunter looked up and was captivated by the scene before him: a large mountain, entirely black—what a huge open-pit coal mine!

    The hunter took the ore samples, remounted his horse, and instead of chasing the wild ox, he galloped towards the geological team's camp.

    猎获（外一章）
    茹芸
    老猎手骑在一匹枣红色的大马上跃上了一座山岗。他勒住马缰，用望远镜探视着眼前广漠的荒原。
    他从镜里面发现：一群野牛正从一片戈壁向着草滩走去。老猎手心里痒滋滋的，他信得过自己百无一失的枪法。在他眼前，仿佛闪现出那将要应声倒下的猎获物。于是，他想着勘探队餐桌上将要添一盆红烧野牛肉……。
    他跨在没鞍的枣红马上，嗖地吹了一声口哨，那马就像一支射出弦的箭一样，蹬蹬蹬地向前奔去。
    老猎手绕行到野牛群的背后，把枣红马隐没在一片柽柳丛中。然后，他就持着枪躲伏在一株柽柳旁边，窥探着牛群。
    他瞄视着，只片刻功夫，火光一闪，枪响了。寂静的荒原，像一池湖水被投进一块巨石，一下被枪声震得晃晃荡荡。野牛群被惊跑了。那最后一只，却出乎猎人的意外，并没有被命中要害——它随着牛群，一道奔逃了。
    老猎手跨上高头大马，向猎获物催马追去。
    负伤的野牛，没命地狂奔逃生。
    老猎手紧紧地追赶着，追赶着。他发誓：绝不放过这个就要到手的猎获物，一定要亲手宰杀这畜牲。
    野牛跑进山里，猎人追进山里。
    野牛仿佛在和猎人捉迷藏：它翻过一个山梁，又隐没在一个山梁里。
    老猎手一边粗鲁地骂着，一边继续穷追着。现在，他已经被不熟悉的丛山包围了。
    眼看就要追上了。但是，枣红马忽然渐渐放慢了蹄子，只见老猎手一骨碌从马背上翻身跳下来，用马靴踢着地上乌黑的石块，又弯腰捡起一块一块乌黑透亮的石头，端详着，端详着……。
    老猎手想起地质队长，想起队长曾经在猎人所住的蒙古包里，对他讲过，这乌黑的石块叫做煤。
    老猎手抬头一看，不禁被眼前的景象迷住了：一座大山，整个是黑乌乌的——这是多么大的一个露天煤山啊！
    猎手带了矿样，重新跨上马背，他不再追赶野牛，却向着地质队驻地的帐篷，纵马驰去。
