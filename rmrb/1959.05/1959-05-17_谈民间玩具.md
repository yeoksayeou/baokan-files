    On Folk Toys
    Li Cun Song

    Toys play an important role in enriching children's lives. They not only satisfy children's desire for activity, but also play a significant role in cultivating children's beautiful emotions and aesthetic concepts. Therefore, toys should not be miniaturized versions of real objects, but beautiful and fun works of art. Many of China's folk toys achieve this.

    Our great motherland, with its vast territory and large population, diverse customs, and hardworking and intelligent people, is destined to have rich and colorful folk art. Folk toys are no exception. The Dragon Boat Festival, Mid-Autumn Festival, and Spring Festival are the three major folk festivals when folk toys appear the most. The sachets of the Dragon Boat Festival, the "Rabbit God" of the Mid-Autumn Festival, and the "Abundance Year After Year" during the Spring Festival are all related to the myths and legends of these festivals and people's wishes, and therefore each has its own characteristics.

    China's folk toys are generally full of life. Whether they are common birds and animals in life, or imaginative mythological figures, they are full of beautiful ideals for life. Therefore, no matter which region or which subject matter is expressed, they all share this common characteristic: ingenious conception, simple shape, bold deformation, vivid expression, strong colors, and concise patterns. Take the "Rabbit God" riding a black tiger as an example. In real life, rabbits are preyed upon by tigers. However, when folk artists create the image of the jade rabbit in the moon palace in mythology, they imagine it as a mighty god, and the fierce king of beasts becomes its docile mount, vividly expressing the "Rabbit God's" divine power. Bringing these two irreconcilable contradictions together in this way is undoubtedly a romantic approach. Moreover, in terms of color, the tiger is boldly painted as a black tiger, which does not exist in real life, forming a strong contrast with the white rabbit. This kind of artistic exaggeration, because it meets the needs of the content, does not give people a sense of unreasonableness at all.

    Fat babies, lions, tigers, chickens, dogs, etc., are all widely used subjects. However, the images created in this region and that region, or even in the same region, are cleverly different, with endless variations, just like "the Eight Immortals crossing the sea, each showing their own unique abilities." What is equally rare is that despite the thousands of changes, at first glance, the baby is still a baby, and the dog is still a dog, maintaining the realism of the object. What is the secret to not making people feel that the images are all the same, yet not like biological specimens? It is bold artistic exaggeration and deformation based on rich imagination. This exaggeration and deformation is not carried out randomly or casually, but rather by tightly grasping the characteristics of the object, making appropriate choices, and expressing different personalities through specific postures and movements, giving them appropriate human touch. This exaggeration and deformation is also based on familiarity with children's psychology and preferences. For example, lions and tigers are ferocious and terrifying beasts in real life, but in folk toys, they are docile, beautiful, and lovable images, yet they do not lose their majestic feeling.

    The use of color in folk toys has the same characteristics as the color in Chinese New Year paintings. It is consistent with the shape of the toy, does not pursue the realism of specimen models, but boldly paints a bright and cheerful tone. The colors it commonly uses are generally mainly bright red, bright green, bright blue, bright yellow, and black. However, due to the skillful combination, smooth brushstrokes, and decorative beauty of the patterns, a magnificent and simple, strong and harmonious effect is formed on the basis of their own unique characteristics, making people feel both excited and relaxed and happy after seeing them. Like the black fat baby in Xi'an, the baby dares to use black as the main color, which is extremely bold, but the beauty lies in the fact that it does not make people feel dirty or evoke associations with coal, but rather makes you feel that this is a dark-skinned farm boy in floral clothes. Affection arises spontaneously.

    Using local materials and cleverly utilizing materials is also a clear characteristic of folk toys. For example, using various colored scraps of cloth to sew colorful sachets, using the branches of bamboo to cleverly and naturally make the horns of a bamboo dragon, etc. Because it is to use small pieces and waste materials as much as possible, the price is popular. Children can buy a favorite toy for just one or two cents. Therefore, folk toys are extremely popular among the masses, especially in rural areas. In the process of mass production and personal sales, folk artists in various places have gained insight into children's psychology, understood the preferences of the masses, taken into account local customs and habits, and improved their artistic skills, thus constantly improving on the basis of popularization, and forming diverse and distinctive styles on the basis of their own originality. Due to the different places of origin of raw materials, this further strengthens and enriches the local characteristics of folk toys. Although their styles are different, they are not self-respecting and mutually exclusive, but unified on the basis of commonly possessing the traditional national artistic characteristics, forming the unique style of Chinese folk toys. Folk toys are all made by farmers or folk artists who have not received specialized art education, which powerfully illustrates that the working people not only understand beauty, but also know how to conduct aesthetic education for the next generation, and from here we can also see the ordinary and profound truth that art comes from life.

    I played with folk toys in my childhood, and at that time I regarded them as intimate little friends. In recent years, I have "played" with folk toys again, but now I worship them as a teacher in my artistic creation. (Attached pictures)

    谈民间玩具
    李寸松
    玩具对丰富儿童的生活占有重要地位，它不仅满足儿童的活动欲求，同时对培养儿童的美好感情和审美观念起着不小的作用，所以玩具不应该是某种实物的按原样缩小，而应该是一种好看又好玩的优美的艺术品。我国的很多民间玩具就做到了这一点。
    我们伟大的祖国，地大人众，风俗多样，人民又勤劳智慧，这就决定了民间艺术的丰富多采。民间玩具当然也不例外。在端阳、中秋、春节三个民间大节期间，是民间玩具出现得最多的时候，像端阳节的香囊，中秋节的“兔儿爷”，在春节中的“年年有余”等等都是和这些节日的神话传说和人们的愿望相联系的，因而都各有其特色。
    我国的民间玩具一般都富有生活气息，不论是生活中常见的禽兽，或是幻想性的神话人物，都充满了对生活的美好理想。因此，不管哪个地区表现哪一种题材，都具有这种共同的特点：造意巧妙，造型单纯，变形大胆，神态生动，色彩强烈，花纹洗练。比如拿“兔儿爷”骑黑虎来说吧，在现实生活中兔子是老虎搏食的对象，但是民间艺人创造这神话中月宫玉兔这个形象时，却把它想像成为威武的神将，凶猛的兽中之王成了它驯服的坐骑，形象地巧妙地表达了“兔儿爷”的神力。将这具有不可调和矛盾的两者如此地组织在一起，无疑是浪漫主义的手法，不仅如此，在色彩上同样大胆地将老虎画成了现实生活中所没有的黑虎，它与白兔又形成了一个强烈对比。这种艺术的夸张，由于符合内容的需要，所以丝毫也没有给人造成不合情理的感觉。
    胖娃娃、狮、虎、鸡、狗等等都是广泛采用的题材，但这个地区与那个地区，或同是一个地区，创造出来的形象却巧妙不同，变化万千，真好比“八仙过海，各显神通”。同样难得的，也在于尽管千变万化，但一眼看来，娃娃还是娃娃，狗还是狗，保持了对象的真实感，这种所以使人不感到形象的千篇一律而又不是生物标本式的奥秘在哪里呢？那就是在丰富想像力的基础上大胆的艺术夸张和变形。这种夸张和变形不是胡乱地随便地进行的，而是紧紧抓住了对象的特征，作了恰当的取舍，又通过特定的姿态和动作表现了不同的个性，赋予了恰如其分的人情味。这种夸张和变形同时又是以熟悉儿童的心理与爱好为前提的。比如狮子、老虎在现实生活中是凶暴可怕的野兽，但是在民间玩具中，却是驯服、美丽，惹人喜爱的形象，然而又不失其威武的感觉。
    民间玩具的色彩运用，和中国的年画色彩具有同样的特色，它和玩具的造型相一致，不追求标本模型式的真实，而是大胆地涂抹出爽朗、欢乐的调子。它所常用的颜色，一般都以大红、大绿、大蓝、大黄、大黑为主，然而由于组合的巧妙，用笔的流利，纹样的富有装饰美揉合一起，在各有千秋的特色上形成了绚烂而又淳朴，强烈而又调和的效果，使人看了之后产生既兴奋激动又轻松愉快的心情。像西安的黑胖娃娃，娃娃竟敢用黑色作主色，真是大胆之极，但妙在并不使人产生肮脏或者引起煤炭之类的联想，而是使你感觉到这是一个黑黝黝的穿着花衣服的农家胖小子。爱慕之心，油然而生。
  就地取材、巧妙地利用材料也是民间玩具显明的特点之一。比如利用各色碎布拼缝五色缤纷的香囊，利用竹子的枝桠巧妙而自然地作成竹龙的角等等。正因为是尽可能地采用小料和废料，故而价格是大众化的。孩子们只要花上一分或二分钱就可买上一件心爱的玩具。所以民间玩具在群众中，特别在农村中是极为普及的。各地的民间艺人在大量制作和亲自销售的过程中洞悉了儿童的心理，了解了群众的爱好，顾及了当地的风俗习惯，提高了自己的艺术技巧，也就这样地在普及基础上不断地提高，在各有独创性的基础上形成了多种多样的鲜明的风格。由于原料产地的不同，这就更加强了和丰富了民间玩具的地方特点。尽管它们风格各有不同，但不是各自为尊、互相排斥的，而是在共同具备传统的民族的艺术特征的基础上统一起来，形成了中国民间玩具独有的风格。民间玩具都是出自没有受过专门美术教育的农民或民间艺人之手，这有力地说明了劳动人民不但懂得美，同时也懂得如何向下一代进行美的教育，从这里也可看到艺术来自生活的平凡而又深刻的真理。
    民间玩具我在童年时代玩过，那时曾经把它当作知心的小朋友看待。近几年来，我又“玩”起民间玩具来，不过现在却是拜它为自己在艺术创作上的一位老师了。（附图片）
