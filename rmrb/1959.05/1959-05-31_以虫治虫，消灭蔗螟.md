Using Insects to Control Insects, Eliminate Sugarcane Borers
Sugarcane borer, also known as heartworm, is the most common and serious pest in sugarcane production. According to typical surveys, sugarcane affected by borer damage has a sugar content decrease of about 10% and a yield reduction of 25%.

The female Trichogramma wasp punctures sugarcane borer eggs on the back of sugarcane leaves with its ovipositor, using its own eggs to destroy the borer eggs before they hatch into larvae. Red ants, a type of sugarcane borer predator introduced into reed tubes, can be placed on sugarcane stubble, and the red ants will kill the sugarcane borers. Using biological control methods to kill sugarcane borers is not only more effective but also less expensive and less labor-intensive. According to experiments in Shajiao Cooperative, Fanshun County, Guangdong, releasing parasitic wasps on 500 mu of land only required 70 workdays and 600 yuan for wasp seeds. If pesticides were used to control the same area, it would require more than 20 times the labor and three times the cost of pesticides compared to the wasp seeds.

    以虫治虫，消灭蔗螟
    蔗螟又叫钻心虫，是甘蔗生产上最普遍而严重的害虫。据典型调查，受螟害的甘蔗含糖率下降10％左右，产量减低25％。
    赤眼蜂的雌蜂用尾戳破蔗叶背后的螟卵，用自己的卵毁灭螟卵孵化幼虫。把引入芦苇管内的一种蔗螟天敌红蚂蚁放置在蔗头，红蚂蚁即可将蔗螟制死。用生物防治办法杀害蔗螟不仅收效大，并且花钱少，费工少。据广东番顺县沙滘社的试验，放寄生蜂五百亩才用七十个工和六百元蜂种费。如果用药防治同样的面积，要多用二十多倍的人工和三倍于蜂种费的药费。
