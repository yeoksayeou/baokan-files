    The Labor-Progressive Party of Canada National Committee Decides to Expand Party's Mass Work
    Restore Party's Name to Communist Party of Canada
    According to a report in the "Canadian Tribune" on the 25th, the National Committee of the Labor-Progressive Party of Canada held a meeting last weekend. The meeting adopted a political resolution analyzing the domestic and international political situation and the party's tasks, and decided to change the name of the Labor-Progressive Party of Canada to the Communist Party of Canada.
    The resolution said: "Today, the ideal of socialism is deeply rooted in the hearts of the majority of all mankind. The working class in our country is carrying out extensive activities on the economic and political fronts, including broad discussions on the ways in which workers engage in political activities and discussions on socialism. At this time, it is appropriate to restore our party's glorious, scientific, and correct name, namely, the Communist Party of Canada. It is completely in line with our party's historical goal of establishing a proletarian communist society in Canada."
    The resolution said that peace, independence, and socialism are the most fundamental solutions to Canada's problems.
    The resolution reiterated the party's position of striving for the unity of the working class and democratic forces on the economic front and in the political field. In this regard, the resolution said that launching a broad and all-encompassing people's political movement firmly based on trade unions will be a decisive factor in uniting the workers' movement and all democratic forces to strive for Canada to pursue a policy of peaceful coexistence and advance along the path of peace and the development of trade and industry.
    The resolution called on the whole party to take action to unite the Canadian people and fight for the realization of a policy based on peaceful coexistence and Canada's withdrawal from the US war camp.
    The resolution, in the section on the party's work, pointed out the failure of those revisionist forces attempting to undermine the party. The resolution said that as a result, the party has been consolidated, and now the party must build on the path of greatly expanding mass work.
    This resolution will be discussed by the party's local organizations and branches before the party's Seventh National Congress is held in November of this year.

    加劳工进步党全国委员会决定
    扩大党的群众工作
    把党的名称恢复为加拿大共产党
    据“加拿大论坛报”25日报道，加拿大劳工进步党全国委员会在上周末举行了会议。会议通过了一项政治决议，分析了加拿大国内外的政治形势和党的任务，并且决定把加拿大劳工进步党改名为加拿大共产党。
    决议说：“今天，社会主义的理想在全人类的大多数人中深入人心，我国工人阶级在经济和政治战线开展广泛活动，其中包括广泛讨论工人进行政治活动的方式和讨论社会主义，在这个时候，正适宜于恢复我们党的光荣的、科学的、正确的名称，即加拿大共产党。它是完全符合我们党的历史目标——在加拿大建立无产阶级的共产主义社会的。”
    决议说，和平、独立和社会主义是加拿大各项问题的最根本的解决办法。
    决议重申了党在经济战线和政治领域争取工人阶级和民主力量团结的立场。在这方面，决议说，开展一个牢牢地以工会为基础的广泛的和无所不包的人民政治运动，将是使工人运动和所有民主力量团结起来，争取在加拿大奉行和平共处政策沿着和平和发展贸易和工业的道路前进的决定性因素。
    决议号召全党采取行动团结加拿大人民，为争取实现以和平共处和使加拿大脱离美国的战争阵营为基础的政策而斗争。
    决议谈到党的工作部分时指出了那些图谋破坏党的修正主义势力的失败。决议说，由于这样的结果，党巩固了，现在，党必须建立在大大扩大群众工作的路线上。
    这个决议在党的第七届全国代表大会在今年11月举行以前将由党的各个地方组织和支部讨论。
