    Himalayan Ballad
    Hai Leng
	Himalayan snow flutters, the great army pursues the enemy with heroic spirit;
	Himalayan snow surges, sweeping away the bandit's nest with overwhelming force;
	Himalayan snow melts, the army and the people are as close as fish and water, enjoying the spring breeze;
	Himalayan snow shines brightly, killing the enemy and rendering meritorious service, as high as the sun and moon.

    喜马拉雅山谣
    海棱喜马拉雅雪飘飘，大军追敌胆气豪；喜马拉雅雪滔滔，横扫匪巢势如捣；喜马拉雅雪融融，军民鱼水乐春风；喜马拉雅雪皎皎，杀敌立功日月高。
