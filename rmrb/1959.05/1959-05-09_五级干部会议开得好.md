　　The five-level meeting was held well, with great airing of views, big blooming, and big-character posters;
　　Speak freely and tell the truth, resolve contradictions and enlighten the mind;
　　As long as the leadership lays its cards on the table, no difficulty can scare us;
　　The leadership and the masses are of one mind, and increasing production and practicing economy are well done.

　　五级干部会议开得好
    浙文
　　五级会议开得好，大鸣大放大字报；
　　畅所欲言吐真情，矛盾解决心开窍；
　　只要领导把底交，任何困难吓不倒；
　　领导群众心一条，增产节约定搞好。
