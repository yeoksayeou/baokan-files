The US-Ngo Group is Creating a "State of War" in South Vietnam
Vietnam Liu Guiqi

　　When the people in the Phu Loi concentration camp were suffering from intestinal cramps due to poisoning, and desperately trying to lift the roof and call for help, the entire Vietnam, the entire peace-loving and upright humanity issued a cry of indignation, a cry that made those murderous culprits tremble with fear.
　　People thought that the US-Ngo group would restrain themselves a little after that. However, the cries for help of the Phu Loi victims were still faintly audible, and the sound of Ngo Dinh Diem's planes indiscriminately bombing the Xa Lai area was deafening. Recently, the situation in South Vietnam has been worrying. Nearly five years after the armistice, South Vietnam under the US-Ngo rule is still in a sea of blood and fire.
　　This is by no means accidental. Due to the aggressive policy pursued by US imperialism in South Vietnam, and due to Ngo Dinh Diem's traitorous policy, the former resistance personnel and patriots in South Vietnam have been continuously subjected to cruel and bloody suppression. Under the guise of so-called "accusing the communists" and "opposing the communists," the Ngo Dinh Diem regime has created 6,172 incidents of retaliation and terror in various parts of South Vietnam since the restoration of peace until November 1957, killing 2,293 former resistance personnel, 778 missing, and 5,185 injured; 65,211 people were illegally arrested, and 10,024 families were imprisoned in concentration camps. Since the end of 1958, the white terror and barbaric suppression by the Ngo Dinh Diem regime has become increasingly serious. The Phu Loi incident is one of the most typical events under the current terrible social system in South Vietnam.
　　The US-Ngo group thought that their murderous policy could stifle the will and aspirations of the 12 million South Vietnamese people. But they are completely wrong! The South Vietnamese people will not yield! The situation in South Vietnam is still developing in the opposite direction to the US-Ngo group's conspiracy. The patriotic movement in South Vietnam is expanding day by day, especially the struggle to expose the criminal acts of the US-Ngo group is rising day by day. Batch after batch of people are constantly flocking to Phu Loi, demanding the return of their husbands and sons who are imprisoned in the jail. Petitions from the masses are pouring in like snowflakes to the International Commission and the South Vietnamese authorities, demanding an investigation into the Phu Loi incident; demanding an end to all bloody suppression. At the same time, the call for the restoration of normal relations between the North and the South, for disarmament, and for the peaceful reunification of Vietnam is rising day by day.
　　In the face of the South Vietnamese people's strong and just struggle, US imperialism and the Ngo Dinh Diem clique are rampantly carrying out brutal armed suppression. Following the military "sweeps" conducted in February 1959 in Binh Duong (formerly Thu Dau Mot Province), Ha Tien, Rach Gia, Ca Mau provinces, and the areas west of central Vietnam, the US-Ngo group recently launched "sweeps" in the areas east of the south. This is the largest military operation since the restoration of peace. They dispatched 10,000 regular troops and thousands of police and civil guard groups, and took military action against the people in Bien Hoa province, thirty kilometers from Saigon. They dispatched planes, artillery, and armored vehicles, indiscriminately bombing and shelling the Xa Lai area, killing countless unarmed peaceful residents. The only "crime" of these people is loving their country and loving peace. Many peaceful villages in this area were burned to the ground, and the people's lives and property suffered serious damage. The US-Ngo group is using war methods to kill the South Vietnamese people. It is worth noting that the above-mentioned military operations were conducted under the command of Samuel Williams, the head of the US military delegation in South Vietnam, and Yang Wenming, the lieutenant general of Ngo Dinh Diem's army.

    美吴集团正在南越制造“战争状态”
    越南  刘贵淇
    当富利集中营里的人们因中毒而肠绞欲断、掀开屋顶向外呼救的时候，整个越南、整个爱好和平和正直的人类发出了愤慨的呼声，这种呼声使得那些杀人罪魁恐惧发抖。
    人们以为美吴集团将会从此收敛一些的。但是，富利被害者求救哀号之声还隐约于耳，吴庭艳的飞机在斜莱地区滥施轰炸的响声却又震耳欲聋。最近，南越的情况是令人焦虑的。停战已经将近五年的今天，美吴统治下的南越仍处于一片血火的海洋之中。
    这绝不是什么偶然的事情。由于美帝国主义在南越推行的侵略政策，由于吴庭艳的卖国政策，在南越的前抗战人员和爱国者连续遭到残酷的血腥镇压。在所谓“控诉共产党”、“反对共产党”的幌子下，自从和平恢复到1957年11月间，吴庭艳政权就在南越各地制造了六千一百七十二起报复恐怖事件，杀害前抗战人员二千二百九十三人，失踪的七百七十八人，受伤的五千一百八十五人；非法逮捕的有六万五千二百十一人，还有一万零二十四户人家被关入集中营。自从1958年年底以来，吴庭艳政权的白色恐怖和野蛮镇压变得越来越严重。富利事件是当前南越可怕的社会制度下最典型的事件之一。
    美吴集团以为他们这种杀人政策能够扼杀一千二百万南越人民的意志和愿望。但是，他们完全错了！南越人民是不会低头的！南越的情况仍然在朝着与美吴集团的阴谋相反的方向发展。南越的爱国运动日益扩大，特别是揭发美吴集团的罪恶行为的斗争日益高涨。人们一批又一批地不断涌向富利，要求还给她们被监禁在牢狱里的丈夫和儿子。群众的请愿书像雪片似地交到国际委员会和南越当局，要求对富利事件进行调查；要求停止一切血腥镇压。同时，要求恢复南北正常关系、要求裁减军备、要求用和平方法实现越南统一的呼声日益高涨。
    在南越人民坚强的正义斗争面前，美帝国主义和吴庭艳集团却猖狂地进行残暴的武装镇压。继1959年2月在平阳（原土龙木省）、河仙、迪石、金瓯等省以及越南中部以西地区进行军事“扫荡”之后，美吴集团最近接着又在南部以东地区发动“扫荡”。这是和平恢复以来规模最大的一次军事行动。他们派遣了一万名正规军以及成千的警察和民卫团，在距西贡三十公里的边和省对人民采取军事行动。他们出动了飞机大炮、装甲车，在斜莱地区滥炸轰击，杀害无数手无寸铁的和平居民。这些人的唯一“罪名”就是爱祖国、爱和平。这个地区的许多和平村庄被焚烧成为平地，人民的生命财产遭受严重的损害。美吴集团正在使用战争手段来杀害南越人民。值得注意的是，上述军事行动是在美国驻南越的军事代表团团长塞谬尔·威廉斯和吴庭艳军队的中将杨文明指挥下进行的。
