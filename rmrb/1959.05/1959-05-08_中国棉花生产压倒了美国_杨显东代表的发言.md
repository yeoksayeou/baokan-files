　　China's Cotton Production Surpasses the United States
　　Speech by Delegate Yang Xiandong
　　Chairman, fellow delegates:
　　I fully agree with and resolutely support Premier Zhou Enlai's government work report, as well as the reports by Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen. Now, I would like to share my personal thoughts and views on the state of cotton production in our country. I welcome any corrections from the delegates.
　　Cotton plays a crucial role in meeting the people's clothing needs and promoting the development of industry and the entire national economy. Under the radiant guidance of the Party's General Line, with the Great Leap Forward in our industrial and agricultural production, cotton production in 1958 also achieved an unprecedented and astonishing leap forward. Both the total output and the yield per unit area surpassed those of the United States. The United States, which has always ranked first in the world in cotton production, has been left behind by our country. According to the latest communique from the State Statistical Bureau, China's total cotton output in 1958 reached 66.38 million dan (lint cotton, same below), an increase of 102 percent over the 32.8 million dan in 1957, and 31 percent higher than the total cotton output of the United States in 1958 of 50.42 million dan (United Nations Monthly Bulletin of Agricultural Economics, January 1959). In terms of yield per unit area, the average cotton yield in China in 1958 was 77 jin of lint cotton per mu, double the 37.9 jin per mu in 1957, and 9.5 percent higher than the 70.3 jin per mu in the United States in 1958.
　　The speed of cotton production increase in our country is unprecedented. Before liberation, China's total cotton output reached a peak of 16.9 million dan in 1936. Due to the destruction by the enemy during the War of Resistance Against Japan and the War of Liberation, cotton production suffered severe losses. When the whole country was liberated in 1949, China's total cotton output was 8.88 million dan, only 52 percent of the highest output in 1936, and 12.7 percent of the total cotton output of the United States in 1949.
　　After liberation, under the leadership of the Party, we vigorously developed cotton production. In 1951, it reached 20.61 million dan, exceeding the highest pre-war cotton production level by 33 percent in just two years.
　　What is even more exciting is that we have seen that from 1951 to 1958, in just seven short years, China's cotton production has achieved further high-speed development, with total output soaring from 20.61 million dan to 66.38 million dan, an increase of 2.2 times; while it took the United States 52 years to increase its cotton production by that much: from 19.54 million dan in 1859 to 68 million dan in 1911 (1928 Yearbook of Agriculture, US Department of Agriculture).
　　We have also seen that in seven years, China's cotton production increased by 222 percent, while the United States declined by 23 percent during the same period (1951-1958).
　　Cotton production has been listed as one of the four major indicators of China's 1959 national economic plan, with a planned target of 100 million dan of lint cotton. We believe that on the basis of the leap forward victory in 1958, under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, and with the continued efforts of the broad masses, we will certainly be able to complete this grand and glorious task. When this task is completed, we will leave the United States even further behind.
　　Fellow delegates! From the example of cotton production alone, it is clear that American imperialism is decaying economically day by day, while we are getting better and better every day. This vividly reflects the tragic picture of the capitalist system in its twilight years. The Great Leap Forward in cotton production in our country has once again proven the tremendous power of the General Line of socialist construction put forward by the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, and fully demonstrates the incomparable greatness of the soaring enthusiasm and collective wisdom displayed by the broad masses under the command of politics and the leadership of the Party. This once again eloquently proves the unparalleled superiority of our socialist system.

### 中国棉花生产压倒了美国  杨显东代表的发言

　　中国棉花生产压倒了美国
    杨显东代表的发言主席、各位代表：
    我完全同意并且坚决拥护周恩来总理的政府工作报告和李富春副总理、李先念副总理、彭真副委员长的报告。现在，谨就我国棉花生产情况谈一谈个人的感想和看法。请各位代表指正。
    棉花在满足人民衣着需要、促进工业和整个国民经济的发展方面，都起着重要的作用。在党的总路线光辉照耀下，随着我国工农业生产的大跃进，一九五八年的棉花生产也获得了空前惊人的大跃进。总产量和单位面积产量都超过了美国。一向在棉花生产方面居世界第一位的美国，已被我国抛到后面去了。根据国家统计局最近的公报，一九五八年我国棉花总产量已达到六千六百三十八万担（皮棉、下同），比一九五七年的三千二百八十万担增加了百分之一百零二，比一九五八年美国棉花的总产量五千零四十二万担（一九五九年一月联合国农业经济月报）高出百分之三十一。在单位面积产量方面，一九五八年我国棉花平均亩产七十七斤皮棉，比一九五七年亩产三十七点九斤增加了一倍，比美国一九五八年每亩七十点三斤高出百分之九点五。
    我国棉花增产的速度是史无前例的。在解放以前，我国棉花总产量在一九三六年曾经达到一千六百九十万担的最高峰。由于在抗日战争和解放战争时期敌人的破坏，棉花生产遭受了严重的损失。当一九四九年全国解放的时候，我国棉花总产量为八百八十八万担，只及一九三六年最高产量的百分之五十二，为一九四九年美国棉花总产量的百分之十二点七。
    解放以后，在党的领导下，大力发展棉花生产，一九五一年即达到二千零六十一万担，仅仅两年的时间，就超过了战前棉产最高水平百分之三十三。
    更令人兴奋的是我们看到：从一九五一年到一九五八年，在短短的七年内，我国棉花生产又获得了进一步高速度的发展，总产量由二千零六十一万担激增到六千六百三十八万担，增加了二点二倍；而美国过去增产这么多的棉花：由一八五九年的一千九百五十四万担到一九一一年的六千八百万担，他们竟花了五十二年的时间（一九二八年美国农部农业年鉴）。
    我们还看到：七年内，我国棉花生产增加了百分之二百二十二，而美国同时（一九五一至一九五八）却下降了百分之二十三。
    棉花生产已经列为我国一九五九年国民经济计划的四大指标之一，计划是一亿担皮棉。我们相信在一九五八年跃进胜利的基础上，在中国共产党的英明领导下，在广大群众的继续努力下，一定能够完成这一宏伟而光荣的任务。当这个任务完成的时候，我们将把美国抛得更远更后面去了。
    各位代表！仅仅从棉花生产这一事例，就可明显地看出：美帝国主义在经济上也是一天天地烂下去，而我们一天天好起来。这生动地反映了资本主义制度日暮穷途的悲惨景象，而我国棉花生产的大跃进，却又一次地证明了党中央和毛主席提出的社会主义建设总路线的巨大威力，充分地说明了在政治挂帅、党的领导下，广大群众发挥出来的冲天干劲和集体智慧的无比伟大。这再一次雄辩地证明了我国社会主义制度的无比优越性。
