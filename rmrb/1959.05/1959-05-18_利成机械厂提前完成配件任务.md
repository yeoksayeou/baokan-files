Xinhua News Agency report: The Licheng Machinery Factory in Changchun City completed its production task for irrigation and drainage machinery accessories for April fifteen days ahead of schedule.

In late March, this factory accepted the task of producing several thousand diesel engine, and locomotive boiler pistons and piston rings. The task required delivery in April, but according to the factory's production capacity, it would not be completed until May 20. In response to this situation, the factory's Party branch launched a large-scale debate among all employees on "How to Ensure the Production of Key Products." During the debate, employees further clarified the important significance of ensuring the completion of the six major equipment projects and resolved to overcome difficulties such as technical and equipment capacity shortages to complete the task on time. Subsequently, a high tide of technical innovation was launched throughout the factory.

In the technical innovation, factory leaders and workers created many methods to improve productivity. Factory Director Wu Hongyou adopted the method of planting experimental plots, and together with technician Li Pichen, veteran workers Qu Yonglu and Sun Shenglian, changed the metal mold for pistons to a metal skin sleeve sand mold, which increased casting efficiency by three times, completing a month's workload in five days. The lathe operators, focusing on the key problem of insufficient equipment capacity and technical strength, boldly implemented the production method of lathe tooling, which increased production capacity by more than two times. The workload originally planned to be done in fifty days was completed in only fourteen days. When worker Yu Guobin of the second lathe group was making iron pistons, he adopted a multi-tool multi-blade universal tool post, reducing the seven processes of fine turning, chamfering, and grooving to two processes, reducing the time to turn a piston from the original twenty-five minutes to three minutes.

    利成机械厂提前完成配件任务
    新华社讯　长春市利成机械厂提前十五天完成了4月份排灌机械配件的生产任务。
    这个工厂在3月下旬接受了生产几千个柴油机、锅驼机的活塞和活塞环任务。这批活要求在4月内交货，但是按照工厂的生产能力要到5月20日才能完成。针对这一情况，工厂党支部发动全厂职工开展
  “怎样保证重点产品生产”的大辩论。辩论中职工们进一步明确了保证完成六大设备的重要意义，决心克服技术、设备能力不足的困难，按时完成任务。接着，全厂掀起了一个技术革新高潮。
    在技术革新中，工厂领导干部和工人们创造了许多提高生产率的办法。厂长吴洪猷采取种试验田的方法，同技术员李丕晨、老工人曲永禄、孙盛连一起把活塞的金属铸模改为金属皮套砂模，铸造效率提高三倍，用五天的时间完成了一个月的工作量。车工们针对设备能力、技术力量不足的关键，大胆地实现了车工胎具化的生产方法，使生产能力提高二倍以上。原计划要做五十天的工作量，只用十四天就完成了。车工二组工人于国斌在做铁活塞的时候采用了多刀多刃万能刀架，把精车、倒楞、车沟等七道工序减为二道工序，车一个活塞的时间由原来的二十五分钟减少到三分钟。
