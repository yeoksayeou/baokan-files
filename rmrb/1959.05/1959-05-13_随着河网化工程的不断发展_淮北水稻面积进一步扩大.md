    With the Continuous Development of River Network Engineering
    The Rice Area in Huaibei Further Expands

    Hefei, May 12 (reported by this newspaper) With the continuous development of river network engineering in the Huaibei area of Anhui Province, the rice planting area has further expanded. This year, the area planned for rice conversion in the Huaibei area will be double that of last year. Currently, on the vast Huaibei Plain, many specialized teams for rice conversion, composed of more than 300,000 farmers, are actively leveling fields, building ridges, cultivating seedlings, and repairing canals. Nearly four million mu of spring rice fields have been ridged, and multiple plowing and fine harrowing have been universally carried out, with a base fertilizer application of around 1,000 dan per mu. The seedlings required for these spring rice fields have been basically cultivated, and the seedling cultivation for summer rice (wheat stubble rice) fields is proceeding intensely.

    To ensure the completion of this year's rice conversion plan, Huaibei has arranged the rice fields to be converted, plot by plot, since last winter, and has trained more than 200,000 farmer technicians for rice conversion, and has modified and added nearly one million pieces of agricultural implements and water lifting tools used for rice cultivation. Party organizations at all levels in Huaibei have further strengthened the leadership of rice conversion work. In Fuyang and Bengbu prefectures, in addition to the establishment of rice conversion leading groups (committees) at the prefectural, county, and commune levels, all production brigades and production teams have further strengthened the organization of the original specialized rice conversion teams, and implemented a contracted responsibility system by dividing areas, with dedicated personnel in charge at each level. At the same time, they have also summarized the experience of high-yield rice cultivation last year, launched a red flag competition, and vigorously promoted a large-scale high-yield movement.

    Since the winter of 1957, the people of Huaibei have built more than 4 billion cubic meters of large and small river network water conservancy projects on the plain of more than 37,000 square kilometers. Large-scale river network projects are still under construction. The newly opened nine new rivers will cut across and connect the Huai River tributaries such as Ying, Fei, Wo, Tuo, Hui, and Sui rivers, forming dozens of large river networks. More than 400 small rivers connected to the large rivers have also been excavated, and another 1,200 are currently being excavated, which will form countless small river networks within the large river networks. Some of these river network projects have already begun to generate benefits, and the water storage has basically met the water needs for rice transplanting this year.

    The Anhui Provincial Party Committee's proposal to implement river networkization and rice cultivation in the Huaibei area, and to transform the disaster-prone Huaibei into a rich Jiangnan, is a strategic measure for developing agricultural production. The water source in Huaibei is also very abundant. As long as large-scale river network projects are carried out, not only can the sky water be retained, but also the surface water can be stored. Groundwater will also gush out as long as it is dug a few meters deep. Under the guidance of the correct policy of river networkization and rice cultivation proposed by the Provincial Party Committee, the area of rice cultivation in the Huaibei area has been expanding year by year.

### 随着河网化工程的不断发展  淮北水稻面积进一步扩大

    随着河网化工程的不断发展
    淮北水稻面积进一步扩大
    本报合肥12日电  安徽省淮北地区随着河网化工程不断发展，水稻种植面积进一步扩大。今年，淮北地区计划改种水稻的面积，将比去年扩大一倍。目前，在千里淮北平原上，有三十多万农民组成的许多改种水稻的专业队，在积极整田、打埂、育秧苗、修渠道。现在已有近四百万亩春稻田打好了田埂，普遍进行了多耕细耙，每亩施基肥都在千担左右。这些春稻田所需的秧苗已基本上育好，同时夏稻（麦茬稻）田的育秧工作正在紧张进行。
    为保证今年改种水稻计划的完成，淮北各地从去冬就逐丘逐块地安排改种的稻田，训练改种水稻的农民技术员达二十多万人，改制、添置了种植水稻所用的农具和提水工具近百万件。淮北各级党组织，进一步加强了改种水稻工作的领导，阜阳、蚌埠两专区除专区、县、公社建立改种水稻领导小组（委员会）外，各生产大队、生产队都进一步健全原稻改专业队的组织，并推行划片包干办法，层层有专人负责。同时，还总结了去年种植水稻丰产经验，开展红旗竞赛，大搞大面积丰产运动。
    自从1957年入冬以来，淮北人民在三万七千多平方公里的平原上，兴修大小河网的水利工程已达四十多亿公方。大规模的河网化工程仍在继续施工，新开的九条新河，将把颖、淝、涡、沱、浍、濉河等淮河支流纵横切断，互相勾通连接起来，组成几十块大河网，与大河穿连的小河也已开挖好四百多条，目前正在开挖的还有一千二百多条，将组成大河网之中无数的小河网。这些河网工程有的在目前已开始发生效益，蓄水已基本上满足今年改种水稻插秧的用水需要。
    中共安徽省委提出在淮北地区实行河网化、水稻化，把多灾的淮北变富饶的江南，是发展农业生产的一项战略性措施。淮北水源也很充足，只要大搞河网化工程，不但可留住天上水，蓄起地面水，地下水只要挖几公尺深便涌出来。在省委提出的河网化、水稻化正确方针指导下，淮北地区种植水稻面积一年比一年扩大。  （李祥仁）
