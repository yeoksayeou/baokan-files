Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, 19th - With a bumper wheat harvest in sight, the agricultural departments of Henan Province have dispatched inspection and acceptance work groups to the countryside to systematically summarize this year's bumper harvest experiences.

Currently, wheat in most parts of the province is nearing full ripeness and will be harvested in about ten days. The Henan Provincial Department of Agriculture and Forestry has recently been receiving numerous calls from various regions requesting personnel to participate in the acceptance process. In order to meet the demands of the masses and systematically summarize the experiences of large-scale bumper harvest areas and high-yield fields, the Henan Provincial Department of Agriculture, the Henan Provincial Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Beijing Agricultural University, Zhengzhou Animal Husbandry School, and other units have dispatched 144 people, including agronomists, lecturers, department and bureau chiefs, and students, to form eleven inspection and acceptance teams which have departed for the countryside.

The inspection and acceptance work groups will eat, live, and labor alongside the farmers, strengthening the work of measuring land, harvesting, threshing, and weighing. Through these hands-on operations, as well as referencing wheat records and holding small-scale symposiums, they will summarize the yield-increasing experiences of different types of regions, such as mountainous areas, hilly areas, saline-alkali areas, low-lying waterlogged areas, riverine plains, and double-cropping rice-wheat areas. They will also summarize the experience of how to implement the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture in accordance with local conditions, in order to elevate these experiences to the level of theoretical principles through scientific analysis and guide future wheat bumper harvests. In order to learn from the negative examples, the work groups will also systematically summarize several low-yield examples, analyze the causes of low yields, and study methods for increasing yields in low-yield areas in the future.

    通过实地操作总结小麦增产经验
    河南检查验收工作组下乡
    新华社郑州19日电　小麦丰收在望，河南省农业部门派出检查验收工作组，深入农村系统总结今年的丰产经验。
    目前全省大部地区的小麦接近黄熟，再有十天左右即将开镰收割。河南省农林厅最近不断接到各地请求派人参加验收的电话。为了满足群众的要求，系统总结各地大面积丰产方和高额丰产田的经验，河南省农业厅、河南省农业科学研究所和北京农业大学、郑州畜牧学校等单位，派出农艺师、讲师、厅局长、学生等一百四十四人，联合组成了十一个检查验收小组，先后出发下乡。
    检查验收工作组将和农民同吃同住同劳动，加强丈量土地、收割、打场、过秤等工作。通过这些实地操作，以及参照小麦档案、召开小型座谈会等，总结山区、丘陵区、沙碱区、低洼易涝区、河川平原区、稻麦两熟区等不同类型地区的增产经验，总结如何因地制宜地贯彻执行农业“八字宪法”的经验，以便通过科学分析把这些经验提高到理论原则的高度，指导今后小麦丰产。为了从反面来吸取教训，工作组也将有计划地总结若干低产典型，分析低产原因，研究今后低产地区提高产量的办法。
