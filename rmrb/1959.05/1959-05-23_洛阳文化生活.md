    Luoyang Cultural Life
    Dragon Gate Scenery
    From the city, take a public bus, cross the Luoyang Bridge, and follow the straight asphalt road for about half an hour to reach the famous Dragon Gate.
    Here, the two mountains stand facing each other, the clear Yi River flows slowly through the gorge, and the mountains are covered with evergreen pines and cypresses. The waterfall in front of Yu Wang Temple sings, stirring up thousands of ripples. The green trees, red flowers, pavilions, and towers on both banks are reflected in the water, forming a beautiful and attractive picture. However, the most fascinating thing is the countless stone carvings on the cliffs. These more than 100,000 exquisitely carved Buddhist statues from the Wei and Tang dynasties are all vivid and lifelike, and are a treasure house of ancient Eastern stone carving art. On holidays, tourists come in droves. They climb the stairs, from one Buddhist cave to another. They like to take photos in front of a 17-meter-high Buddha statue in Fengxian Temple and send the photos as treasures to friends and relatives in faraway places.
    Museum of the Nine Dynasties' Capital
    People who visit the Dragon Gate pass by Guanlin and go to Guan Di Temple to pay their respects. This is not only because of its magnificent scenery and because it is one of the larger Guan Di Temples in the country, but also because it has become a museum of the Nine Dynasties' capital, displaying a large number of unearthed cultural relics in recent years.
    These cultural relics, which have been sleeping for thousands of years, have been accumulated through archaeological excavations in coordination with infrastructure construction. After research and annotation by archaeologists, they have become material materials for explaining the ancient social life of Luoyang. From these displays, you can see the production tools of the Stone Age 5,000 years ago, grains from 2,000 years ago, the Tang Dynasty's precious art product, the mother-of-pearl inlaid mirror, and the majestic and vivid large stone beast carved 1,800 years ago.
    "Wangcheng Park is Spring in All Seasons"
    "Luoyang peonies are the best in the world." In mid-April, more than 70 kinds of peonies in Wangcheng Park bloomed together, and people came to admire the flowers one after another. The four or five thousand bowl-sized peonies in the park are red, yellow, white, purple..., and the "Hehuan Jiao," a very precious variety, has particularly large flowers and bright red color, which is the most eye-catching; the white "Cang Tou Zi" is like a fairy coming out of a cave, with slender branches, charming and lovely. The "Tong Zi Mian," whose flowers are as delicate as baby faces, are like innocent and lively children, playing in the dense foliage of the flowers. Every flower faces the spring breeze, smiling, and welcomes people who come to admire the flowers.
    In addition to peonies, Wangcheng Park cultivates hundreds of precious flowers and trees on its more than 20 hectares of land. The park has a zoo, music pond, pavilions, flower sheds, etc.
    People are grateful for the gardeners' hard work, because they make the peonies bloom in the severe winter with heavy snow, and make the rare epiphyllum bloom four times a year. They let more than a hundred kinds of flowers in a long row of greenhouses compete for beauty and bloom in all seasons. (With pictures)

    洛阳文化生活
    龙门风光
    从市区乘公共汽车，跨过洛阳桥，顺着笔直的柏油马路，行约半小时就到达中外著名的龙门。
    这里两山遥相屹立，清澈的伊水缓缓地流过这个阙口，满山松柏四季常青，禹王台前的瀑布喧唱着，激起万千涟漪，两岸的绿树红花、楼阁亭台，一齐倒映水中，构成一幅幽美诱人的图画。但是，最能引人入胜的是峭壁上的无数石刻。这十余万躯魏唐时期雕刻精美的佛像，个个神采奕奕，栩栩如生，是古代东方石刻艺术的宝库。每逢假日，游人络绎不绝，他们攀登阶梯，从一个佛洞到另一个佛洞，他们喜欢在奉先寺一尊高达十七公尺的佛像前拍照留影，并把照片当珍品寄给在远方的朋友和亲人。
    九朝故都的博物馆
    去龙门游览的人，路经关林都要到关帝庙去瞻仰一番。这不仅因为它风景壮丽，是国内规模较大的关帝庙之一，而且，因为这里已经成为九朝故都的博物馆，内中陈列着大批近年出土文物的精华。
    这些沉睡了几千年的文物，是在基建配合考古发掘中积累起来的，经过考古学家的研究注释，成为说明洛阳古代社会生活的物质材料。从这些陈列中，可以看到中国五千年前石器时代的生产工具、两千年前的粮食、唐代的名贵艺术品螺钿镜，以及一千八百年前，雕刻得雄浑生动的大石兽。
    “王城公园四季春”
    “洛阳牡丹甲天下”。4月中旬，王城公园的七十多种牡丹一齐开放，赶来观花的人接连不断。园里四、五千朵碗口大的牡丹，颜色有红、有黄、有白、有紫……，品种极为珍贵的“合欢娇”花朵特大，颜色鲜红，最惹人注目；白色的“藏头子”如仙女出洞，枝棵苗条，妖娆多姿可爱。花朵像娃娃脸一样娇嫩的“童子面”如天真活泼的儿童，嬉游于花丛密叶之中。朵朵花儿都迎着春风，张着笑脸，迎接着前来赏花的人们。
    除牡丹之外，王城公园二十多公顷的土地上，培植了几百种珍贵花木。园里设有动物园、音乐池、凉亭、花棚等。
    人们感谢园丁的辛勤劳动，因为他们使牡丹在大雪纷飞的严冬下开放，使罕见的昙花一年开放四次，他们让一长排温室里的百多种花卉，经常争芳斗艳，四季如春。（附图片）
