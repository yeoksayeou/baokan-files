    World-Renowned Brew
    Pilsen Beer from Czechoslovakia
    Czechoslovakian beer is a world-famous brew. People can taste Czechoslovakian beer not only in the cities and villages of Europe, but it is also sold to Asia, Africa, and the Americas. China is also a customer of Czechoslovakian beer.
    Pilsen is the hometown of Czechoslovakian beer, and the Pilsner Urquell Brewery is the oldest brewery in Czechoslovakia. This April marked its 100th anniversary. Over the past century, this factory has experienced countless changes along with society. In the era of the capitalist republic and German fascist rule, the factory's production developed, but very slowly. At the end of World War II, just before liberation, it was bombed by American planes, destroying 60% of the factory buildings and causing losses of more than 300 million crowns. Although Americans also like to drink Pilsen beer, for the monopoly capitalists, when the factory was about to return to the hands of the people, this could not but be a threat to their monopoly profits, so they carried out a cruel and merciless bombing. After liberation, the government vigorously repaired the factory, and the workers became the masters of the factory. They devoted themselves to production with great enthusiasm, and the factory truly entered its golden age.
    Few people who come to Pilsen to visit do not go to see this factory. This brewery is like a small town, covering ninety hectares, employing more than two thousand workers, and having a nine-kilometer-long wine cellar, entirely carved out of the rock. In addition to maintaining some traditional brewing methods, the factory has been fully mechanized in other respects. Why is the beer from the Urquell Brewery particularly famous? Besides its 100 years of history and experience, it also has a particularly good wine cellar and a unique ninety-meter-deep water well. People say that the water from this well plays a great role in the aroma and purity of the beer.
    Currently, eleven large breweries in Czechoslovakia have united to form the Pilsen Beer Enterprise, two of which are in Pilsen and the other nine in other states. The products of the Urquell Brewery rank first in both quantity and quality. In 1958, it produced 150 million liters of beer, and this year's production will increase by 3% compared to last year. The export volume of Czechoslovakian beer is also increasing day by day. Taking the Urquell factory as an example, in 1958 it increased thirty-five times compared to 1945, accounting for two-thirds of the total export volume. Among the export destinations, socialist countries are the largest customers, with the Soviet Union ranking first and the German Democratic Republic second. Therefore, people say that Pilsen beer is the pride of the Czechoslovak people.

    誉满全球的佳酿
    捷克斯洛伐克比尔森的啤酒
    捷克斯洛伐克的啤酒是闻名世界的佳酿，人们不仅在欧洲的城市和乡村可以尝到捷克斯洛伐克的啤酒，它也销往亚洲、非洲、美洲各地，中国也是捷克斯洛伐克啤酒的主顾。
    比尔森是捷克斯洛伐克啤酒的家乡，而比尔森的乌尔基尔啤酒厂是捷克斯洛伐克历史最悠久的一个厂，到今年4月，正好是它的一百周年了。一百年来，这个厂随着社会一道经历了无数的变迁，在资本主义共和国和德国法西斯统治的年代里，这个厂的生产虽然在发展，但是很缓慢的。而在第二次世界大战末期，即将解放的前夕，它又遭到了美国飞机的轰炸，60％的厂房受到破坏，损失达三亿多克朗。虽然美国人也喜欢喝比尔森的啤酒，但对于垄断资本家来说，当工厂将要回到人民手中时，这对它们的垄断利润也不能不是一种威胁，因此进行了残酷无情的轰炸。解放后，政府大力修复了这个工厂，工人们作了工厂的主人，他们以巨大的热情投入了生产，这个厂才真正走上了它的黄金时代。
    到比尔森来参观的人很少不到这个厂去看一看的。这个啤酒厂真像一个小城镇，占地九十公顷，有二千多工人，一条九公里长的藏酒窖，完全是从山岩中开辟出来的，这个厂除了还保持一些传统的煮酒方法外，其它方面已经全部机械化了。为什么乌尔基尔啤酒厂的啤酒特别有名望呢？除了它有一百年的历史和经验，也因为它有一个特别好的藏酒窖和一个特有的九十公尺深的水井，人们都说，这个井的水对啤酒的香醇纯净起了很大的作用。
    目前，捷克斯洛伐克有十一个大的啤酒厂已联合成为比尔森啤酒企业，其中两个在比尔森，其它九个在别的州。而乌尔基尔啤酒厂的产品无论在数量和质量上都是占第一位的，1958年它生产了一亿五千公升啤酒，今年将比去年增产3％。捷克斯洛伐克啤酒的输出量也日益增加，就以乌尔基尔厂来说，1958年比1945年增加了三十五倍，它占整个出口量的三分之二。在输出的对象中，社会主义国家是最大的主顾，苏联占第一，德意志民主共和国第二。所以人们说，比尔森的啤酒是捷克斯洛伐克人民的骄傲。
