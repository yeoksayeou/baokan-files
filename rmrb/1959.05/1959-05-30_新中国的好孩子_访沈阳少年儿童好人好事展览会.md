     Good Children of New China
    ——Visiting the Good Deeds Exhibition of Shenyang Children
        By Our Correspondent Lai Denong
    On the eve of "June 1st" Children's Day, this reporter visited the "Good Deeds Exhibition of Children" held by the Dadong District "Children's Home" in Shenyang City. This is one of the dozens of exhibitions held in Shenyang City during the campaign to promote communist ethics education among young people. From the introduction materials of the deeds displayed in this exhibition, it can be seen that the communist ethics of Shenyang's children are constantly growing.
    "Timur Team"
    The "Timur Team" is a team of children in Shenyang that has done a very good job in supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers. The members of this team are students from Xiaodong Road First Elementary School, and the captain's name is Wang Ping. From the second grade, they often went to the home of Wang Kuiwu, an elderly widow of a revolutionary martyr, to help with odd jobs. In the third grade, after learning the lesson "Helping Grandma Guo with Work" in their language class, they became even more enthusiastic about working for Grandpa Wang. They heard that the old man's son had died in the War to Resist U.S. Aggression and Aid Korea, and that the old man and his wife were over seventy years old and had no one to take care of them. Whenever they had time, they would organize to help chop firewood, carry water, sweep snow, and wipe windows. When they went to Grandpa Wang's home, they sang, danced, and told stories to comfort the elderly spiritually, making the old man and his wife smile. The two old people were also very concerned about these children, often asking about their studies and life, and were grateful for the children's help. They wrote letters to the school many times, praising them as good children of the motherland.
    Because of its outstanding work in supporting the army and giving preferential treatment to families of revolutionary martyrs and soldiers over the past few years, this team was named "Timur Team" by the school brigade. This year, it attended the Shenyang City Activists Conference for Families of Revolutionary Martyrs and Soldiers and was commended by the Shenyang Municipal People's Committee.
      Helping the Old and the Young
    One afternoon, Zhao Zixiang, a student in Class Two of Sixth Grade at Xiaoheyan Street First Elementary School, was walking home from school. As soon as he left the school gate, he encountered an old lady from the countryside asking for directions to a hostel. Although he was very hungry at the time, he did not hesitate to help the old lady find a hostel. He searched from 3 p.m. until dark, but he could not find a hostel with vacancies. He was very anxious and asked the old lady if she had any relatives in Shenyang. The old lady said she did, on Sanjing Street. He was very happy to hear this, so he took the old lady to the tram stop, wrote a note saying, "This old lady is getting off at Sanjing Street," and gave it to the conductor along with the baggage. As the tram started, the old lady thanked him with tears of excitement, saying, "You are truly a good child of New China!" In the past year, there have been 7,800 such cases of children helping the old and the young in Dadong District.
    Beneficial Labor
    One day, Young Pioneers Xiang Wenfang and Deng Junhua went to look for Wei Guozhong to play with. When they got to his door, they couldn't find him anywhere, and the whole house was full of black smoke. They hurriedly shouted into the house: Is anyone inside? There was a hum in the house, but no movement. Disregarding the smoke, they rushed into the house and saw Aunt Wei, who was sick with arthritis, lying on the bed, covering her head with a quilt because she couldn't stand the smoke. The two of them knew this wouldn't do, so they ran outside and found three children, Zhao Wenying, Wang Xiwen, and Wang Zhicheng. Everyone worked together, busy removing ashes, fetching water, and mixing mud, and quickly repaired the stove. Aunt Wei thanked them in person, and later asked her son to tell the school teacher about this to thank the teacher for educating such good children.
      Everyone is Good
    Lei Fengxian is a student in Class Four of Fourth Grade at Dabeijie Third Elementary School. She has consistently maintained full marks in every subject. She has been named a good student by the school several times, and she also received the title of excellent team member last semester. The other eight students in her group did not study very hard, so she helped them review and solve difficult problems at any time. With her help, the students gradually became willing to study hard, but some students still had bad habits of fighting and cursing. She went to break up fights, but these students not only didn't listen but also cursed her. After being ridiculed and hit several times, Lei Fengxian was a little discouraged, thinking that helping was useless, so she might as well not bother. But when she saw her red scarf, she thought that Young Pioneers must not bow their heads in the face of difficulties, so she continued to muster courage to help them. Half a year later, with her help, five students improved their academic performance to four or five points and became team members. The three students who liked to fight also corrected their bad habits, eliminated the phenomenon of failing grades, and actively strived to join the team. (Attached picture)

     新中国的好孩子
    ——访沈阳少年儿童好人好事展览会
        本报记者　赖德浓
    “六一”儿童节前夕，记者访问了沈阳市大东区“少年之家”所举办的“少年儿童好人好事展览会”。这是沈阳市在开展青少年共产主义品德教育运动中，举办的数十个展览会当中的一个。从这个展览会上展出的事迹介绍材料中，可以看出沈阳市少年儿童的共产主义品德正在不断成长。
    “铁木儿小队”
    “铁木儿小队”，是沈阳市少年儿童在拥军优属方面做得很出色的一个小队。这个小队的成员，是小东路第一小学的学生，队长名叫王萍。他们从二年级起就经常到烈属王魁武老大爷家里帮助做零活。到了三年级，他们从语文课中学习了“帮助郭老大娘干活”的课文以后，给王老大爷干活更加起劲了。他们听说老大爷的儿子是在抗美援朝中牺牲的，老大爷、老大娘已经七十多岁，家中无人照顾，一有空就组织起来去帮助劈柴、挑水、扫雪、擦玻璃。他们到王老大爷家里后，又唱歌、又跳舞、又讲故事，从精神上安慰老人，引得老大爷、老大娘喜笑颜开。两位老人也非常关心这群孩子，常常问他们的学习和生活情况，并感激孩子们对他的帮助，曾多次写信送到学校，赞扬他们是祖国的好儿童。
    这个小队由于几年来在拥军优属方面做得出色，被学校大队命名为“铁木儿小队”，今年出席了沈阳市烈军属积极分子大会，受到沈阳市人民委员会的表扬。
      扶老携幼
    一天下午，小河沿街第一小学六年级二班学生赵子祥放学回家，一出校门，就碰到一个从乡下来的老大娘在打听客栈。他这时虽然肚子很饿，却毫不犹豫地帮助这位老大娘去找客栈。他从下午三时一直找到天黑，还未找到有空位的客栈。他非常着急，就问老大娘在沈阳有没有亲戚，老大娘说有，在三经街。他听了很高兴，就把老大娘送到电车站，写了个“这位老大娘在三经街下车”的条子，连包袱一块交给了售票员。电车开动了，老大娘含着兴奋的泪珠向他感谢说：“你真是新中国的好孩子！”大东区儿童像这样扶老携幼的事迹一年来有七千八百多件。
    有益的劳动
    一天，少先队员项文芳、邓君华两人一块儿去找魏国忠玩，走到他家门口，始终不见人影，只见满屋是黑烟。他们忙向屋里喊：里面有人吗？屋里哼了一声又没有动静了。他们不顾烟呛奔进了屋子，只见魏婶闹关节炎病倒在炕上，因为受不住烟呛，用被子把头蒙上。两人一看这怎么能行，赶快奔到屋外，找来了赵文英、王希文、王直成三个小朋友，大家一齐动手，忙着掏灰、打水、和泥，很快修好了炉子。魏婶当面感谢了他们，后来又叫儿子把这件事告诉学校老师，感谢老师教育出这样的好孩子。
      人人都好
    雷凤先是大北街第三小学四年四班的学生，每门功课一直保持全五分。曾几次被学校评为好学生，上学期还获得优秀队员称号。她的小组内的其他八名同学不大用功学习，她就随时帮助他们复习和解决疑难问题。同学们在她的帮助下，渐渐肯用功学习了，但是有的同学仍然存在着爱打架、爱骂人的不良习惯。她去劝架，这些同学不但不听，反而骂她。雷凤先受到几次讽刺、打击后有些灰心了，心想帮助也无用，不如不管。但当她一看到自己的红领巾，想到少先队员决不能在困难面前低头，就又继续鼓起勇气帮助他们。半年后，有五个同学在她的帮助下学习成绩提高到四分、五分，成了队员，爱打架的三个同学也纠正了不良的习惯，消灭了学习成绩不及格的现象，并积极争取入队。（附图片）
