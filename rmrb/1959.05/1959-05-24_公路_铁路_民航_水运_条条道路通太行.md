    Highways, Railways, Civil Aviation, Water Transport:
    Every Road Leads to Taihang

    (Our report) The Taihang Mountains, with their precipitous cliffs and crisscrossing ravines, are now covered with a network of transportation routes, connecting them with all parts of the country.

    In the past, there were only horse-cart roads five or six feet wide and winding, rugged mountain paths. During the Anti-Japanese War, Japanese imperialism drove people to add rails to the Bai (Gui) Jin (Cheng) line of the highway, transporting weapons and ammunition for killing, and seizing the produce and grain of the Taihang Mountains. People hated the invaders and the Baijin line. They repaired the road under the threat of bayonets during the day, and dismantled it at night; in order to hinder the "mopping-up" operations of the Japanese invaders, the roads leading to the mountains were even more thoroughly destroyed.

    Now the roads here are like a net. The entire region has more than eighty highways, railways, and earthen railways, with a total length of 2,048 kilometers. More than 80% of the people's communes have access to automobiles. There are more than 1,500 transport vehicles, 3,158 rubber-wheeled carts, plus various iron-wheeled horse carts, manpower flat carts, and handcarts distributed on various roads. On average, each of the 700,000 farm households in the region has one vehicle.

    The three major innovations in transportation in 1958 were the most inspiring. The civil aviation flight from Taiyuan to Changzhi, the heart of southeastern Shanxi, opened on July 1. The first local railway, the Xianli Railway, which is 144 li long, has been opened from near the Xianli Iron Mine in Huguan County to the Changzhi Iron and Steel Plant and the Luan Mine. On the mountain routes of more than 100 li long at Tunjing Reservoir, Yuelin Mountain Reservoir, and Shencun Reservoir, white sails were raised for the first time. The Zhan (Dian) Dong (Guan) Railway, which is under construction, will closely link the Taihang Mountains with urban and rural areas throughout the country and will accelerate the socialist construction of the mountainous areas.

### 公路　铁路　民航　水运  条条道路通太行

    公路　铁路　民航　水运
    条条道路通太行
    本报讯　悬崖绝壁、沟壑纵横的太行山，现在遍布四通八达的交通网，和祖国各地沟通起来了。
    过去，这里只有一些五、六尺宽的马车道和蜿蜒曲折的崎岖山路。抗日战争时期，日本帝国主义驱使着人们在公路白（圭）晋（城）线加铺了铁轨，运进了杀人的武器弹药，抢走了太行山区的土产和粮食。人们恨侵略者也恨白晋线，白天在刺刀威逼下修路，晚上又把它拆毁；为了阻碍日寇的“扫荡”，通往山区的道路破坏的更彻底。
    现在这里的道路已经像网一样，全区共有公路、铁路、土铁路八十多条，全长达二千零四十八公里，80％以上的人民公社都通了汽车；分布在各条公路上的运输汽车达一千五百多部，胶皮轮大车三千一百五十八辆，加上各种铁轮马车、人力小平车、手推车，全区七十万农户，每户平均有了一辆车。
    1958年在交通事业上的三大创举最振奋人心。由太原到晋东南心脏——长治民航班机于7月1日通航。第一条全长一百四十四华里的地方铁路——西安里铁路由壶关县西安里铁矿附近到长治钢铁厂和潞安矿已经通车。屯绛水库、月林山水库、申村水库等五处长达百多里的山上航线，第一次扬起了白帆。正在建设中的詹（店）东（观）铁路将使太行山区和全国城乡紧紧地联结在一起，将加速山区的社会主义建设。　（李旺先）
