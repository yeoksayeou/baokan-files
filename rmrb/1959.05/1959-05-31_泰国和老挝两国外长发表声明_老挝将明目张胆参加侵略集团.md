Xinhua News Agency, 30th: Bangkok dispatch: According to a broadcast from Thai radio, Thai Foreign Minister Nai Thanat Khoman, upon leaving Laos on the 29th, issued a joint statement with Lao Foreign Minister Khamphan Panya. This joint statement blatantly disregards the Geneva Accords and offers a feeble justification for the act of dragging Laos into the Manila Treaty aggression bloc.

The statement shamelessly declared that no foreign country should attempt to influence the decision as to whether to participate in "international" or "regional" organizations. The joint statement also brazenly stated that various measures taken by countries within the scope of their sovereignty and laws should not be understood as affecting peace.

This statement, cloaked in high-sounding terms such as "respect for each country's decision on its own affairs" and "sovereignty," completely violates international agreements and the obligations undertaken by the Royal Lao Government. At the 1954 Geneva Conference, the Royal Lao Government declared that the Kingdom would not participate in military alliances. This statement by the Royal Lao Government was also guaranteed by the participating countries of the Geneva Conference in the final declaration of the conference. This is not to be undermined by anyone with any excuse.

The statement also said that Laos and Thailand will further expand and promote the existing "cooperation" between the two countries. This shows that Thailand, at the instigation of the United States, will further support the Royal Lao Government's actions to launch a civil war and undermine peace in Indochina.

    泰国和老挝两国外长发表声明
    老挝将明目张胆参加侵略集团
    新华社30日讯  曼谷消息：据泰国电台广播，泰国外交部长乃他纳·科曼在29日离开老挝时，同老挝外交大臣坎番·班雅发表了联合声明。这项联合声明公然不顾日内瓦协议，为把老挝拉入马尼拉条约侵略集团的行动强作辩解。
    这项声明居然露骨地宣称，关于是否决定参加“国际性”的或“区域性”的组织，任何外国都不应该企图对此施加影响。联合声明还厚颜无耻地说，各国在主权和法律范围内所采取的各种措施，将不会被理解为这些做法会影响和平。
    这项在所谓“尊重各国对自己事务的决定”、“主权”等等堂皇的名词掩盖下的声明，彻头彻尾违背了国际协议和老挝王国政府所承担的义务。在1954年日内瓦会议上，老挝王国政府曾经声明，王国政府不参加军事同盟。老挝王国政府的这项声明还曾由日内瓦会议的参加国在会议最后宣言中予以保证。这是不容许任何人以任何借口加以破坏的。
    声明还说，老挝和泰国将进一步扩大和促进两国之间原有的“合作”。这就表明，泰国在美国的指使下，将进一步支持老挝王国政府发动内战破坏印度支那和平的行动。（左上插图作者：江帆）（附图片）
