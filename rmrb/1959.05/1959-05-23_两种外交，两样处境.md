    Two Kinds of Diplomacy, Two Different Situations

    After each session of the Geneva East-West Foreign Ministers' Conference, the delegations of the six participating countries simultaneously hold press conferences at the "Press House" in downtown Geneva, so that journalists can learn about the conference from here, because journalists are not allowed to enter the conference venue to listen. Here, the feelings at the press conferences of the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic are completely different from those at the press conferences of Western countries such as the United States, Britain, France, and West Germany. Attending the former's press conference makes people feel cheerful, while entering the latter's press conference only makes people feel suffocated. The generation of these two different feelings is of course not due to the size and brightness of the rooms where the press conferences are held, but because the East and the West pursue two different diplomatic policies.

    The Soviet delegation has always been the focus of attention of all parties, and its press conferences are often packed. The journalists covering the news certainly know that the Soviet Union plays a pivotal role in today's world and at this conference. They know that it was thanks to the initiative and efforts of the Soviet Union that this conference was convened. They also know that it was thanks to the Soviet Union's firm struggle that the two Germanys were able to participate in the conference. Although the Soviet Union's proposal for Poland and Czechoslovakia to participate in the conference has not yet been realized due to the obstruction of Western countries such as the United States, this issue remains on the agenda.

    What Western diplomats fear most is that the peaceful foreign policy of socialist countries is closely linked to the aspirations of peace-loving people all over the world. The diplomacy of socialist countries makes everything clear in front of the public of all countries, hitting the Western diplomacy that violates the interests of the people and attempts to deceive the people right in the middle. The Soviet Union grasped the key to the current dangerous situation in Europe and proposed a draft peace treaty with Germany and suggestions for normalizing the situation in West Berlin. The West must indicate whether it is willing to seriously discuss these two issues. Faced with this simple and clear test, the "package plan" used by the United States, West Germany, and others to obstruct the solution of any international problem is exposed. Even Western newspapers have to admit that the Soviet Union has a moral and political "huge advantage" at the Foreign Ministers' Conference.

    In order to deal with this situation, some Western journalists have had to resort to fabricating out of thin air. For example, at the beginning of the conference, the London "Times" said that the Soviet Union had "abandoned" its proposal to allow Poland and Czechoslovakia to participate in the conference. Soviet delegation spokesman Kharlamov immediately pointed out at the press conference that this rumor was groundless. He asked on the spot: "Is the gentleman representing the 'Times' also here?" A gentleman hesitantly raised his hand, and sounds of ridicule resounded throughout the audience.

    The young German Democratic Republic, which participated in the East-West Foreign Ministers' Conference for the first time, gave people a lively and profound impression. Its press conferences also attracted many journalists. The German Democratic Republic issued the confident voice of the German people from the conference and from the press conferences, demanding the speedy conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany, demanding that all German people live a peaceful and free life, and demanding the peaceful reunification of their country through the approach and negotiations of the two Germanys. Just as West German militarism, with the support of the United States, is stepping up its war threat to Europe, it is really gratifying for peace-loving people to have such a force on German territory defending the interests of the German people and the cause of European peace. Although US Secretary of State Herter and West German Foreign Minister Brentano and his ilk chant "non-recognition" of the German Democratic Republic, this will not affect the rapid growth of the political and economic strength and the rising international status of this Germany belonging to workers and peasants. Now, Herter has to discuss issues with German Democratic Republic Foreign Minister Bolz. However, it is ridiculous that he was still trying to deny that this country was an "international entity" on the 18th!

    When people turn their eyes from the Soviet Union and the German Democratic Republic to Western countries, they see a completely different picture.

    On the eve of the Foreign Ministers' Conference, Herter and other US officials did not hide that they were attending the conference against their will. They repeatedly emphasized that the hope of reaching an agreement was "slim" and that the United States had decided "not to give an inch." However, after arriving in Geneva, Herter, under the strong pressure of world public opinion, had to put on another face and turned to repeatedly stating that the United States was "very sincere" in striving to reach an agreement and that it had "made great concessions" to cater to the Soviet Union. However, as the saying goes, "a lie has short legs": before long, Herter put forward the Western "package plan" to refuse to discuss the peace treaty with Germany and the end of the West Berlin occupation system.

    People remember that Herter once promised to continue to implement the policies of the "great politician" Dulles. When he spoke against the Soviet draft peace treaty with Germany on the 17th, he specifically quoted Dulles's "advice." Naturally, among the words that Herter regarded as "holy decree," he would not lack Dulles's "famous saying" a few months ago: any suggestion to end the Cold War is a "drug."

    Herter was appointed Secretary of State by Eisenhower after a special health check by a doctor after Dulles became seriously ill. He looks healthy in public, but severe rheumatism has finally forced him to walk with a cane, limping. US delegation spokesman Berding is also old and frail, and speaks unclearly at press conferences, even often saying the wrong things. He once had to apologize to reporters and say: "Please forgive me, I am too old."

    Old age and illness are, of course, the physiological phenomena of these American diplomats; but isn't this precisely the characteristic of current American foreign policy?

    West Germany, the United States' "closest ally" in Europe, is also in a predicament like the United States. When West German representatives speak publicly at the conference, they also hypocritically talk about seeking an agreement; however, no one will fail to see that West German Foreign Minister Brentano is conducting "hotel diplomacy" in Geneva with a large delegation, doing everything possible to obstruct and undermine the conference. He deliberately did not attend the conference, but let his agent support the Western "phased plan" at the conference, which did not allow the Germans to solve their own problems. This is indeed a strange thing rarely seen in the history of diplomacy. No wonder West German spokesmen are constantly being questioned by reporters. They kept asking: "Why is Brentano not attending the conference?" The answer was: "Because Bolz is attending, Brentano is not attending." However, the answer changed in a while: "When Brentano needs to attend, he will attend the conference in some circumstances." Then the spokesman said again: "Brentano's main task is to maintain contact with Western foreign ministers outside the conference." It is really stretched, and there are many embarrassing situations.

    In the week since the Foreign Ministers' Conference, France has come forward to act as the "cold war" vanguard in the West. French Foreign Minister Couve de Murville's statement upon arrival in Geneva and his subsequent speeches at the conference openly opposed reaching an agreement. French spokesmen also used more rude language to attack the Soviet Union at press conferences than other Western countries. This reminds people that the de Gaulle government is now living on West German loans and investments and continuing the Algerian colonial war. The fact that the French delegation appeared at this Foreign Ministers' Conference as a "West German spokesperson" has led some French newspapers to point out that this will put France in "isolation" among the public of various countries. At the press conferences here, French spokesmen are often subjected to harsh questions from French progressive journalists and journalists from other countries. There are reports that some political circles in Paris are already uneasy about this situation. They believe that the French Foreign Minister has done too openly, and West Germany and the United States can hide behind and avoid being the first to bear the brunt.

    In the Western camp, Britain has tried its best to add some "independent" color to itself at the Foreign Ministers' Conference. When Lloyd spoke at the Foreign Ministers' Conference, he expressed "full support" for the United States on the one hand, and from time to time expressed "understanding" of the Soviet Union's different proposals when opposing the Soviet Union's proposals. Lloyd also expressed "wholehearted" support for the Western "package plan" proposed by Herter at the conference, but the next day, newspapers closely related to the British government expressed great dissatisfaction with the plan. Lloyd has one eye on the United States, and Britain has recently deepened its "interdependence" with the United States in the development of nuclear weapons and space exploration programs; at the same time, the other eye is on West Germany's increasingly plump feathers and the real threat to Britain, and on the mood of British voters. This situation makes the spokesmen of the British Foreign Office, who often boast of having "traditional experience" in bourgeois diplomacy and being eloquent, often stammering at press conferences and "no comment" on this and that. This can also be said to be a portrayal of the decline of the British Empire.

    The representatives of Western countries hold more than one "strategic meeting" here every day, but the "Western common front" has shown cracks since the beginning of the conference. Reuters of Britain announced a different British version of the plan before Herter proposed the Western "package plan." This approach angered US and West German officials. American columnist Joseph Alsop specifically wrote an article criticizing Britain for deliberately making trouble with the United States and others, which aroused the unhappiness of British officials here. In addition, the Confederation of British Industry and Reuters recently decided to establish offices in the German Democratic Republic almost simultaneously, regardless of the strong reaction that would inevitably be caused in Britain's Western allies. All this shows that behind the "Western common front" is mutual suspicion, each with its own agenda.

    The first round of the East-West diplomatic confrontation in Geneva has clearly revealed: two kinds of positions, two kinds of diplomacy, and how different their situations are! People here have noticed that the room where the Soviet Union holds press conferences at the "Press House" is spacious and bright, while the room where the United States holds press conferences is dark and difficult to endure. Although this is an interesting coincidence, it is also a vivid portrayal of the situation of these two kinds of diplomacy in the East and the West today.

    两种外交，两样处境
    新华社记者　万光
    日内瓦东西方外长会议每天会议结束后，参加会议的六国代表团同时在日内瓦市中心的“记者之家”里分别举行记者招待会，以便让记者们从这里得知外长会议的情况，因为记者们是不能进入会议会场旁听的。在这里，人们在苏联和德意志民主共和国的记者招待会上的感受，同在美、英、法、西德等西方国家记者招待会上的感受迥然不同。参加前者的记者招待会使人心情开朗，而进入后者的记者招待会会场只会叫人感到憋气。这两种不同的感受的产生，当然不是由于举行记者招待会的房间大小和光线明暗所致，而是由于东西方奉行两种不同的外交政策。
    苏联代表团一直是各方注意的中心，它的记者招待会经常座无虚席。采访新闻的记者们当然都知道，苏联在今天的世界上以及在这次会议中具有举足轻重的作用。他们知道：正是由于苏联的主动和努力，这次会议才得以召开。他们也知道，正是由于苏联的坚定斗争，两个德国才得以参加会议。虽然因为美国等西方国家的阻挠，苏联关于波兰和捷克斯洛伐克参加会议的主张还未能实现，但是这个问题依然保留在议程上。
    西方外交家们最害怕的是，社会主义国家的和平外交政策同全世界各国爱好和平人民的心声息息相通。社会主义国家的外交在各国公众面前使一切事情黑白分明，正中西方既违背人民利益又企图蒙蔽人民的外交的要害。苏联抓住当前欧洲危险局势中的关键，提出对德和约草案和使西柏林局势正常化的建议。西方必须表示是否愿意认真讨论这两个问题。在这个简单而明确的考验面前，美国、西德等用来阻挠解决任何国际问题的“一揽子计划”的黑底子，便暴露无遗了。连西方报纸也不得不承认，苏联在外长会议上拥有道义上和政治上的“巨大优势”。
    为了对付这种形势，有些西方记者只好乞灵于凭空捏造。例如，伦敦“泰晤士报”在会议开始时就曾经说，苏联“放弃了”让波兰和捷克斯洛伐克参加会议的主张。苏联代表团发言人哈尔拉莫夫立即在记者招待会上指出，这种谣传毫无根据。他当场问道：“代表‘泰晤士报’的先生是否也在这里呢？”一位先生迟疑地举了一下手，耻笑的声音顿时响遍全场。
    第一次参加东西方外长会议的年轻的德意志民主共和国，给人以生气勃勃的深刻印象。它的记者招待会，也经常吸引了不少记者。德意志民主共和国从会议上以及从记者招待会上发出了德国人民的充满着信心的声音，要求迅速缔结对德和约，要求保证全德国人民过和平、自由的生活，要求通过两个德国的接近和谈判来和平统一他们的祖国。正当西德军国主义在美国支持下加紧对欧洲进行战争威胁的时候，在德国领土上有这样一个力量在捍卫着德国人民的利益和欧洲和平的事业，实在不能不使爱好和平的人们极为欣慰。尽管美国国务卿赫脱和西德外交部长勃伦塔诺之流口中念念有辞地赌咒“不承认”德意志民主共和国，但是这丝毫也不能影响这个属于工人和农民的德国的政治、经济力量的迅速增长和国际地位的蒸蒸日上。现在，赫脱已经不得不同德意志民主共和国的外交部长博尔茨在一起讨论问题了。可是，可笑的是：他在18日还竭力否认这个国家是一个“国际实体”哩！
    当人们的视线从苏联和德意志民主共和国转到西方国家，便看到一幅完全不同的景象。
    在外长会议举行的前夕，赫脱等美国官方人物并不掩饰，他们是违背了他们的本意来参加会议的。他们一再强调，达成协议的希望“甚微”，美国决定“寸步不让”。但是，在到达日内瓦后，赫脱在世界公众强大的压力下又不得不装出另一副姿态，转而一再表示，美国“非常诚恳”地争取达成协议，它已经“作出很大的让步”来迎合苏联了。然而，俗语说得好，“谎言的腿不长”：曾几何时，赫脱就提出西方的“一揽子计划”来，拒绝讨论对德和约和结束西柏林占领制度的问题。
    人们记得，赫脱曾经保证要继续执行“伟大的政治家”杜勒斯的政策。他在17日发言反对苏联的对德和约草案时，还特地引用了杜勒斯的“忠告”。自然，在赫脱奉为“圣旨”的话当中，不会缺了杜勒斯几个月前的这句“名言”：任何结束冷战的建议都是“毒品”。
    赫脱是在杜勒斯病重之后经过医生的特别健康检查才由艾森豪威尔任命为国务卿的。他在公开场合里表现出健康的样子，但是严重的风湿症终于使他不得不扶着拐杖，一颠一跛地走路。美国代表团发言人伯丁也是老态龙锺，在记者招待会上口齿不清，甚至常常讲错话。他有一次不得不向记者道歉说：“请原谅，我年纪太大了。”
    老和病，固然是这几个美国外交家们的生理现象；但是，难道这不正是目前美国外交政策的特征吗？
    西德，这个美国在欧洲的“最亲密的盟友”，也同美国一样处在窘境之中。西德代表在会上公开发言的时候也假惺惺地谈论谋求协议；但是，谁也不会因此而看不到，西德外交部长勃伦塔诺带着一个庞大的代表团在会外紧张地进行着“旅馆外交”，对会议极尽阻挠、破坏之能事。他故意不出席会议，而让他的代理人在会上一味支持西方不让德国人自己解决自己事情的那种“分阶段计划”，这确是外交史上不多见的怪事。难怪西德的发言人不断受到记者们的追问。他们紧紧追问道：“勃伦塔诺为什么不出席会议？”回答是：“因为博尔茨出席，所以勃伦塔诺不出席。”但是，不一会儿答案就变了：“需要勃伦塔诺出席时，他在某种情况下会出席会议。”接着发言人又说：“勃伦塔诺的主要任务是在会外同西方外长们保持接触。”真是捉襟见时，窘状百出。
    外长会议一周以来，在西方出面充当“冷战”急先锋的是法国。法国外长德姆维尔在到达日内瓦时的声明以及其后在会上的发言都公开反对达成协议。法国发言人在记者招待会上也使用比其他西方国家更加粗暴的语言来攻击苏联。这使人想起了，戴高乐政府现在正在靠西德的贷款和投资度日以及继续进行阿尔及利亚殖民战争。法国代表团在这次外长会议上俨然以“西德代言人”身份出现的这个事实，使得一些法国报纸也指出，这样做法将使法国在各国公众中陷于“孤立”。在这里的记者招待会上，法国发言人经常受到法国进步记者和其他国家记者的严词质询。有消息说，就是巴黎的一部分政界人士也已经对这种情况感到不安，他们认为，法国外长做得过于露骨了，西德和美国反而可以躲在后面，避免首当其冲。
    在西方阵营里，英国在外长会议上竭力设法给自己添加某些“独立”的色彩。劳埃德在外长会议上发言时，一面表示“充分支持”美国，一面在反对苏联建议时又不时表示“可以理解”苏联提出不同的主张。劳埃德还在会上表示“全心全意”支持赫脱提出的西方“一揽子计划”，可是第二天同英国官方有密切联系的报纸又纷纷对这个计划表示很不满意。劳埃德的一只眼睛看着美国，英国新近在发展核武器和空间探测计划等方面已经加深了它同美国的“相互依赖”；而同时，另一只眼睛又看着西德羽毛日渐丰满对英国的现实威胁，看着英国国内选民的情绪。这种处境就使得经常自夸有资产阶级外交“传统经验”和能说会道的英国外交部的发言人在记者招待会上常常支吾其词，对这样那样事情都“没有评论”了。这也可以说是大英帝国没落的写照吧。
    西方国家代表们每天在这里都要举行一次以上的“战略会议”，但是“西方共同阵线”从会议开始后便显出了裂痕。英国的路透社在赫脱提出西方的“一揽子计划”前宣布了这个计划的不同的英国版本，这种作法激怒了美国和西德的官员们。美国专栏作家约瑟夫·艾尔索普特地为这件事撰文指责英国故意同美国等闹别扭，而这又引起这里的英国官员的不快。此外，英国工业联合会和路透社又不顾必然会在英国的西方盟国中引起的强烈反应，最近几乎同时决定在德意志民主共和国设立办事处。凡此种种，说明在“西方共同阵线”后面的正是相互猜疑，各怀鬼胎。
    在日内瓦的东西方外交交锋的第一个回合已经明白显露出：两种立场，两种外交，它们的处境又是如何不同！这里的人们注意到，苏联在“记者之家”举行记者招待会的房间宽敞明亮，而美国举行记者招待会的房间却幽暗难当。这虽然是个有趣的巧合，然而，也正是东西方这两种外交今天处境的生动的写照。
