    Precious Historical Documents

    In order to implement the policy of "excavating cultural heritage and serving the present," the Tunxi Ancient Book Store in Anhui Province has sorted out a batch of precious historical documents after more than a year of collection and sorting work.

    This batch of historical documents includes official documents, contracts, account books, fish scale registers, genealogies, etc. Such as a complete set of deed papers for more than 540 years from Hongwu to Hongguang in the Ming Dynasty and from Shunzhi to Xuantong in the Qing Dynasty; fish scale registers from the Xuande, Chenghua, Jiajing, and Wanli periods of the Ming Dynasty; indenture of sale from the Jiajing, Longqing, and Wanli periods; official case files, notes, judgments, announcements, licenses, court summons, store account books, genealogies, etiquette books, lantern festival books, ancestral hall construction books, family division books, etc. of various counties under the jurisdiction of Huizhou since the Ming and Qing Dynasties. There is also a "Geyuan Public Surname Joint Ink," from the third year of Xianfeng, which is a contract in which farmers jointly demanded rent reduction from landlords.

    珍贵的历史文献资料
    安徽省屯溪古籍书店为了贯彻“发掘文化遗产、古为今用”的方针，经过一年多的搜集、整理工作，已整理出一批珍贵的历史文献资料。
    这批历史文献资料，包括官府公文、合同契约、帐册、鱼鳞册、宗谱等。如明代洪武至弘光、清代顺治至宣统连续五百四十多年的全套契纸；明代宣德、成化、嘉靖、万历年间的鱼鳞册；嘉靖、隆庆、万历年间的卖身契；明清以来徽州所属各县的官府案卷、札文、判批、告示、执照、堂票、商店帐册、宗谱、礼典簿、灯会簿、建祠簿、分家书等等。还有一张咸丰三年的“阁源众姓合墨”，是一张农民联合要求地主减租的合约。
