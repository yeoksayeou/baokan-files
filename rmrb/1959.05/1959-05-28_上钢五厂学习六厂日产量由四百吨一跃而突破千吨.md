    Shanghai, May 26th (By our own correspondent) The Shanghai No. 5 Steel Plant humbly learned from the advanced experiences of fraternal plants like Shanghai No. 6 Steel Plant, concentrated its efforts on tackling the problem of converter furnace lining life, and rapidly changed its backward production situation. On May 23rd, the plant's steel output created a new high record of 1,053 tons per day. Among them, the converter workshop produced 101 heats per day, with an output of 903 tons, an increase of 1.3 times compared to the average daily output from May 1st to 22nd. The electric furnace workshop also achieved an output of 150 tons on this day, an increase of 43% compared to the average daily output of the first 22 days of May.

    The Shanghai No. 5 Steel Plant is a new plant that was completed in the second half of last year. The steelmaking section currently has one electric furnace workshop and one converter workshop. The No. 5 Steel Plant's converter workshop is the largest in the city in terms of designed output and the most modern in equipment, but its production situation has always been poor. In the first five and a half months of this year, the plant's daily output has remained at around 300 to 400 tons. Whether the converter workshop's production can increase has become the key to whether the plant can complete the state plan. In early May, the Party organization of the converter workshop, under the leadership of the plant's Party committee, conducted an inspection in the spirit of rectification, analyzing the reasons for failing to complete the production plan. The main reason was that some cadres were arrogant and complacent and unwilling to humbly learn from the advanced experiences of fraternal plants. After inspection and criticism, the cadres' understanding was improved. Immediately, under the leadership of the plant's Party committee secretary and plant director, they went to fraternal plants such as Shanghai No. 6 Steel Plant and No. 3 Steel Plant to learn from their experiences together with the workers. The entire workshop "focused on increasing furnace lining life, with strict implementation of operating procedures as the key," concentrating its efforts on vigorously carrying out technical innovation, strengthening production management, and tackling the furnace lining life problem. Since mid-May, the production situation has rapidly improved. Originally, the furnace lining life of the No. 5 Steel Plant's converters was the lowest in the city, with an average of only about 20 heats per furnace. From May 19th to 23rd, the average furnace lining life has reached 44.5 heats. Among them, one furnace has blown 67 heats, creating a new record in the city.

    上钢五厂学习六厂日产量由四百吨一跃而突破千吨
    本报上海26日电  上海第五钢铁厂虚心学习上钢六厂等兄弟厂的先进经验，集中力量围攻转炉炉龄关，生产落后面貌迅速改观。5月23日全厂钢产量创造了日产一千零五十三吨的最高纪录。其中转炉车间日炼一百零一炉，产量九百零三吨，比5月1日到22日的平均日产量增长一点三倍。电炉车间这天产量也达到一百五十吨，比5月份前二十二天平均日产量提高43％。
    上钢五厂是去年下半年才建成的新厂，炼钢部分现有一个电炉车间，一个转炉车间。五厂转炉车间是全市设计产量最大、设备最现代化的车间，可是它的生产情况一直较差。今年头五个半月中，全厂日产量一直停留在三、四百吨左右，转炉车间生产能否增长上去，成为这个厂能否完成国家计划的关键。5月初，转炉车间党组织在厂党委领导下，以整风精神进行检查，分析完不成生产计划的原因，主要在于部分干部骄傲自满，不虚心学习兄弟厂先进经验。经过检查批判，干部的认识提高了，当即在厂党委书记、厂长率领下，与工人群众一道到上钢六厂、三厂等兄弟厂学习经验。全车间“以提高炉龄为中心，以严格执行操作规程为重点”，集中力量大搞技术革新，加强生产管理，围攻炉龄关。5月中旬以后，生产情况迅速好转，原来上钢五厂转炉炉龄是全市最低的，平均每只炉子只能吹炼二十炉左右，从5月19日到23日止，平均炉龄已达到四十四点五炉，其中有一只炉子曾吹炼六十七炉，创造全市新纪录。
