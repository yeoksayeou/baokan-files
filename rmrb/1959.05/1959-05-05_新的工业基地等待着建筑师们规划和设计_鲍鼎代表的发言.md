Comrade Chairman, Fellow Delegates:

    I fully agree with and wholeheartedly support the Government Work Report made by Premier Zhou, as well as the reports made by other leading comrades.

    Premier Zhou's report pointed out that our country's situation, both domestically and internationally, is good, and our endeavors in all aspects are thriving and advancing rapidly. Under the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, and inspired by the General Line of "going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in building socialism," the people of the whole country are more closely united around the Party and Chairman Mao. Our country is more prosperous and flourishing than ever before. Premier's report inspires each of us, and I must implement the spirit of the Premier's report into my own work, contributing more and better to fulfilling the tasks proposed in the report.

    The development of Wuhan's industrial construction and the changes in the city's appearance fully demonstrate the unparalleled superiority of the socialist system.

    Premier's report specifically mentioned the tremendous and comprehensive leap forward in our national economic development in 1958. Taking the development of Wuhan as an example, it is equally exciting. The No. 1 blast furnace of Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation, one of China's major iron and steel complexes, was completed and put into production ahead of schedule last year. The output of this one blast furnace alone is three times the total output of the four blast furnaces of the Hanyang Iron Works in the old society. And we are building four such large blast furnaces in total. Last year, many above-quota machinery manufacturing factories, light industry factories, etc. in Wuhan were also fully or partially completed and put into production. The Yangtze River Bridge, dreamed of for decades in the old society, was completed and opened to traffic as early as 1957. In recent years, Wuhan has built hundreds of kilometers of high-grade roads and sewers. Cultural education, scientific research, and medical and health undertakings have all developed accordingly. Hundreds of thousands of square meters of employee housing have been built in large areas. All of these, compared with the past, surpass the achievements of the old era by decades or even centuries. Like many other large cities in the country, Wuhan has undergone fundamental changes and has become one of China's important socialist industrial cities. According to the call of the Party and the government, Wuhan will be built into a strong base of socialist industrialization in the shortest possible time. In 1959, Wuhan has nine central government-administered above-quota basic construction projects. The modern Wuhan Port has already started construction. Sixteen counties in Xiaogan Prefecture, Hubei Province, have been incorporated into Wuhan. This presents new tasks and new requirements for Wuhan's urban planning and architectural design work. Under the leadership of the Party, we have full confidence in happily accepting this glorious task. After listening to Premier's report, we deeply realize the unparalleled superiority of our socialist system. Compared with capitalist cities, which cruelly exploit the working people and serve the interests of monopoly capital, our socialist cities have eliminated exploitation, and the working people are truly masters of their own affairs. Our cities serve production and the working people first and foremost. Capitalist cities are full of economic crises and the fear of unemployment, while our production is constantly developing. We rely on the vast domestic market and do not know what an economic crisis is. We have fundamentally eliminated unemployment and greatly feel the shortage of labor. In capitalist cities, as Premier's report mentioned, their laborers are full of sorrow and pain. Our working people work for the construction of socialism and their own happiness, with soaring enthusiasm. We are full of joy and hope in our work. It should be pointed out that the development of capitalist cities is spontaneous, limited by the private ownership of land and the pursuit of high profits by monopoly capital. Cities cannot be developed in a planned way and controlled in a planned way. The traffic and sanitation conditions in cities are very bad. A small handful of monopoly capital giants live in extravagance, while the vast majority of working people live in darkness. On the contrary, our cities, in accordance with the laws of planned and proportional development of the socialist national economy, have been able to develop in a planned way and control in a planned way from the very beginning, according to the established urban plan. Our socialist system ensures that the living standards of the broad masses of the people are gradually improved with the development of production. All of this fully demonstrates the unparalleled superiority of our socialist system. Obviously, in the words of Chairman Mao, capitalist cities are rotting away day by day, while our cities are getting better day by day.

    The magnificent picture of the motherland's construction inspires architectural workers

    As mentioned above, capitalist cities are limited by private ownership of property, and urban planning often becomes empty talk on paper. Capitalist countries have published many papers, reports, and plans related to urban planning work in recent years, but very few have been put into practice. Architectural workers in capitalist countries are often not using what they have learned, and there is even the risk of unemployment. Our country now has hundreds and thousands of large, medium, and small cities and new industrial bases, and tens of thousands of people's communes waiting for us to plan and design, which opens up infinitely broad prospects for our urban planning and architectural design work. In particular, the emergence of people's communes has made our architectural workers see the infinitely beautiful prospects of the motherland, unfolding before our eyes an infinitely magnificent picture. In the future, tens of thousands of beautiful flowers of people's communes will bloom all over the cities and villages of the motherland, and hundreds and thousands of large, medium, and small cities will be interspersed among them according to the rational layout of the whole country as one chessboard. These cities and people's communes, scattered like stars in the sky, will emit brilliant light on the land of the motherland. The emergence of people's communes has greatly promoted the development of our country's production. In the future, through national industrialization and commune industrialization, agricultural mechanization and electrification, our country's social products will gradually change from not abundant to abundant. Through the landscaping of the land, our cities will become colorful and evergreen all year round. Our countryside will become what the peasants say, "Look far away, it's Huaguo Mountain; look close, it's the Ninth Heaven." By that time, our motherland will become even more lovable, and our lives will surely become more beautiful, infinitely beautiful, and endless. Comrades, let us all work together, striving forward in the infinitely beautiful direction pointed out by the Party!

    As an architect, it is necessary to concentrate the wisdom of the masses to improve design ideas and artistic level.

    As an architect, under the leadership of the Party, we have made certain achievements in urban planning and architectural design. However, our past work is not satisfactory enough. We have taken many detours. In urban planning work, we have not done enough to combine theory with practice and long-term with short-term. Our theoretical level of work is very poor. Recently, in the planning and design of people's communes, we have not understood enough the principle of running communes diligently and thriftily and building them in stages and batches.

    In architectural design work, we once went from the bare box-like structuralism to the retrogressive classicism of large roofs. After retrogressive classicism was rejected, we one-sidedly emphasized economy. For a period of time, the buildings we designed were either all red (red bricks and red tiles) or all gray (blue bricks and blue tiles). We have not fully embodied the Party's policy of achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results and being applicable, economical, and beautiful under possible conditions.

    After the anti-rightist rectification movement, many architects transformed their bourgeois standpoints, and the double leap forward in ideology and work initially appeared. The Party led us to change the past cold and desolate working methods of being locked in the drawing room, relying solely on a flash of inspiration in our own minds, and making a big stroke of the pen. We began to learn to take the mass line and launch mass movements. We conducted collective investigations, collective creations, and collective discussions. We conducted on-site investigations, learned from workers and peasants, and designed on-site. Facts have proved that this working method of mass line and mass movement not only accelerated the design speed and concentrated the wisdom of the masses but also improved the design ideas and artistic level of architects, which is worth promoting.

    Because architects have made a double leap forward in ideology and work, some architectural designs of relatively good quality have emerged. These architectural designs have basically achieved diversification and richness of form. Some designs use large roofs but do not have the ancient and dull atmosphere; some use Western-style colonnades but are different from Western classical colonnades; some are large glass windows and arched thin shells but are different from structuralism. Architects have broken away from the past blind copying and imitation in their designs and have begun to learn to creatively use the good traditions of Chinese and foreign architecture. Generally speaking, these buildings with relatively good design quality can basically meet the Party's policy of being applicable, economical, and beautiful under possible conditions.

    It should be pointed out that this improvement in the architectural creation level of architects is only the beginning. Compared with the level of architects in the Soviet Union and other fraternal countries, we are still far behind. All these so-called buildings with relatively good design quality, if we carefully measure them again today, under the same economic conditions and the same construction and material conditions, in some aspects, such as overall layout, plane arrangement, body volume, proportional weighing, detail decoration, the use of lines and tones, as well as structure and equipment, etc., is it not possible to design them more beautifully and perfectly? This shows that our architects' cultivation of architectural art theory and their mastery of technology and skills are still not enough. In order to do our work well, our architects must continue to thoroughly transform our thinking, carry out the struggle between the two roads of promoting proletarian ideology and eliminating bourgeois ideology in design work, that is to say, to promote proletarian ideology in design and eliminate bourgeois ideology in design. We must unswervingly learn from the Soviet Union, strengthen the study of theoretical policies, earnestly understand the Party's policies and guidelines and implement them into specific design work. We must constantly strive to create, strive to study, and improve our theoretical level and technical level. Only in this way can we better shoulder the glorious tasks entrusted to us by the Party.

    The above opinions are not correct enough, please criticize and correct them.

### 新的工业基地等待着建筑师们规划和设计  鲍鼎代表的发言

    新的工业基地等待着建筑师们规划和设计
    鲍鼎代表的发言主席、各位代表：
    我完全同意并且衷心拥护周总理所作的政府工作报告，和其他各位首长所作的报告。
    周总理的报告指出了，我们的国家，无论在国内方面，或者是在国际方面，形势都是好的，我们的事业，各方面都在欣欣向荣，都在快步前进。全国人民在党和毛主席的英明领导下，在鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义总路线的鼓舞下，更加紧密地团结在党和毛主席的周围。我们的国家比过去任何一个时期都更加兴旺，更加昌盛。总理的报告鼓舞了我们每一个人，我一定要把总理报告的精神贯彻到自己的岗位工作中去，为完成报告中所提出的任务，更多更好地贡献自己的力量。
    武汉工业建设的发展，城市面貌的变化，充分显示了社会主义制度的无比优越
    总理报告中特别提到了一九五八年我国国民经济发展方面巨大的、全面的跃进。就拿武汉市的发展情况来说，同样是令人兴奋的。作为我国主要钢铁联合企业之一的武汉钢铁公司的第一号高炉，去年提前建成投入生产了。仅仅这一个高炉的产量就等于旧社会时代汉阳铁厂四个高炉产量总和的三倍，而我们一共要建四个这样的大型高炉。在去年，武汉有许多限额以上的机械制造工厂、轻工业工厂等等，也先后全部或部分建成投入生产。在旧社会梦想了几十年的长江大桥，早在一九五七年即已建成通车。这些年来武汉市修建了数以百公里计的高级路面和上下水道。文化教育、科学研究和医药卫生事业，都有了相应的发展。数以百万平方公尺的职工住宅，成片地兴建起来。所有这些，和过去相比，胜过了旧时代的几十年、几百年。和全国的许多大城市一样，武汉市的面貌已经起了根本的变化，它已经成为我国重要的社会主义工业城市之一。按照党和政府的号召，武汉市在最短期内，将要建设成为社会主义工业化的强大基地。一九五九年武汉市中央直属限额以上的基本建设项目共有九个，现代化的武汉港已经开工兴建了。湖北省孝感专区的十六个县已经划入武汉市。这就对武汉市的城市规划工作和建筑设计工作提出了新的任务和新的要求。在党的领导下，我们完全有信心来愉快地接受这一光荣的任务。听了总理报告以后，我们深深体会到我国社会主义制度的无比优越性。和资本主义城市相比，资本主义城市残酷剥削劳动人民，为垄断资本的利益服务。我们社会主义城市已经消灭剥削，劳动人民真正当家作主，我们的城市首先为生产劳动人民服务。资本主义城市充满了经济危机和失业恐慌，我们的生产永远发展，我们依靠广大的国内市场，根本不知道什么是经济危机，我们根本消灭了失业，而且大大感到劳动力的不足。在资本主义城市里，正像总理报告中提到的，他们劳动者中间充满了忧愁和痛苦。我国劳动人民为建设社会主义和自己的幸福而劳动，干劲冲天，我们在劳动中充满了欢乐和希望。应该指出，资本主义城市的发展是自发的，它受到了土地私有制和追求垄断资本的高额利润的局限性，城市不可能有计划地发展和有计划地加以控制，城市的交通卫生情况非常恶劣，一小撮垄断资本巨头穷奢极欲，绝大多数劳动人民则过着暗无天日的生活。恰恰相反，我们的城市，按照社会主义国民经济有计划按比例发展的规律，从一开始就有可能按照制定的城市规划，有计划地发展和有计划地控制。我国社会主义制度保证广大人民的生活水平，随着生产的发展而逐步提高。所有这一切，都充分显示了我们社会主义制度的无比优越性。显而易见，按照毛主席的说法，资本主义城市在一天天烂下去，我们的城市在一天天好起来。
    祖国宏伟建设的图景鼓舞着建筑工作者
    如上所述，资本主义城市受到财产私有制的限制，城市规划往往变成纸上空谈。资本主义国家近几年来出版了不少有关城市规划工作的论文报告和方案等等，但是真正付诸实施的寥寥无几。资本主义国家的建筑工作者，往往用非所学，甚至还有失业的危险。我们国家现在有数以千百计的大中小城市和新的工业基地，数以万计的人民公社，在等待着我们去规划设计，这就给我们的城市规划工作和建筑设计工作开辟了无限广阔的前途。特别是人民公社的出现，更使我们建筑工作者看到祖国无限美好的前景，在我们眼前展开了一幅无限雄伟壮丽的图画。将来数以万计的人民公社美丽的花朵，开遍祖国的城市和乡村，数以千百计的大中小城市，按照全国一盘棋的合理布局，穿插其间。这些星罗棋布的城市和人民公社，将在祖国大地上放出万丈的光芒。人民公社的出现，大大促进我国生产的发展，将来通过国家工业化，和公社工业化，农业机械化和电气化，我国社会产品将逐步由不丰富到丰富。通过大地园林化，我们的城市将变成万紫千红，四季长春。我们的农村将变成像农民所说的，“远看花果山，近看九重天”。到那个时候，我们的祖国，将会变得更加可爱，我们的生活一定会更加美好，以至无限美好，永无止境。同志们，让我们大家齐心合力，朝着党所指出的这个无限美好的方向，努力奋斗前进！
    作为一个建筑师，要集中群众的智慧提高设计思想和艺术水平
    作为一个建筑师，在党的领导下，我们在城市规划和建筑设计工作中，取得了一定的成绩。但是，我们过去的工作是不够令人满意的。我们走过不少弯路。在城市规划工作中，我们对于理论与实际相结合，远期与近期相结合，做得很不够。我们工作的理论水平很差。最近在人民公社的规划设计中，对于勤俭办社、分期分批建设的方针更体会不够。
    在建筑设计工作中，我们曾经由光秃秃方盒子的结构主义，走向大屋顶的复古主义。复古主义反掉以后，又片面强调经济。有一个时期我们设计出来的建筑物，不是一片红（红砖红瓦），便是一片灰（青砖青瓦）。我们对于党的多快好省和适用经济、可能条件下美观的方针，全面体现很不够。
    经过反右整风运动，许多建筑师改造了自己的资产阶级立场，才初步出现了思想工作双跃进。党领导我们改变了过去冷冷清清，关在绘图室里，单凭自己脑子里灵机一动，大笔一挥的工作方式，开始学会了走群众路线和大搞群众运动。我们集体调查，集体创作，集体讨论。我们现场调查，向工农群众学习，现场设计。事实证明，这种群众路线和群众运动的工作方式，不仅加快了设计速度，集中了群众智慧，更提高了建筑师们的设计思想和艺术水平，是值得推广的。
    由于建筑师们出现了思想工作双跃进，因而也就出现了一些质量比较好的建筑设计。这些建筑设计基本上做到了形式多样化和丰富多采。有的设计采用了大屋顶，但没有古老沉闷的气息；有的采用了西洋式的柱廊，但不同于西洋古典式的柱廊；有的是大玻璃窗和拱形薄壳，但不同于结构主义。建筑师们在设计中摆脱了过去的盲目抄袭和模仿，开始学会了创造性的运用中外建筑的优良传统。一般说来，这些设计质量比较好的建筑物，都能基本符合党的适用经济可能条件下美观的方针。
    应该指出，建筑师们这种建筑创作水平的提高，现在仅仅是开始。和苏联以及其他兄弟国家建筑师的水平相比，我们还远远落在后面。所有这些所谓设计质量比较好的建筑物，今天如果再仔细衡量一下，在同样的经济条件和同样的施工和材料条件下，在某些方面，例如总体布局、平面布置、体型体量、比例权衡、细部装饰、线条和色调的运用，以及结构和设备等等方面，不是不可能设计得更美观一些，更完善一些。这就说明我们建筑师对于建筑艺术理论的修养，对于技术和技巧的熟练程度，还掌握得很不够。为了搞好我们的工作，我们建筑师一定要继续彻底改造自己的思想，在设计工作中开展两条道路兴无灭资的斗争，这就是说，要兴设计中的无产阶级思想，灭设计中的资产阶级思想。我们要坚持不懈地向苏联学习，要加强理论政策的学习，认真领会党的政策方针并把它贯彻到具体设计工作中去。我们要不断努力创造，努力钻研，提高自己的理论水平和技术水平。只有这样，我们才能更好地担负起党交给我们的光荣任务。
    以上意见，不够正确，请代表们批评指正。
