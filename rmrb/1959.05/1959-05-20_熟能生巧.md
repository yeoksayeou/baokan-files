    Practice Makes Perfect
    Liu Ziju
    As the saying goes, "Practice makes perfect." The so-called "practice" means that people have more contact with objective things or more operations (performances). For example, if people's ears hear more, the sound becomes "familiar"; if people's eyes see more, the colors or shapes become "familiar", and so on; the so-called "perfect" means that people can know the mysteries and tricks of objective things, so they can do more, faster, better and more economically, and it is not easy to make mistakes. For example, we often see those skilled workers and accomplished artists, who often handle their work or art performances with ease, their skills are superb, and they are foolproof.
    If we use philosophical terms to explain "practice makes perfect", the so-called "practice" refers to the quantitative change of things, and the so-called "perfect" refers to the qualitative change of things. "Practice" is the continuous contact and feeling of people with the phenomena and forms of objective things, and it is the perceptual knowledge of people about objective things; "Perfect" is the knowledge and understanding of people about the essence, content, internal connections, and development laws of objective things, and it is the rational knowledge of people about objective things.
    So, how can "practice" "make" "perfect"? In terms of people's knowledge and operation (performance) skills of objective things, there is a unique development (processing) process from "practice" to "perfect". This special development process is usually called the summary of social practice experience (successful experience, especially unsuccessful experience). So, what is experience summary and how to conduct experience summary? The so-called experience summary is the concrete Marxist-Leninist analysis of the results of some repeated social practices (whether it is successful or failed), finding out the reasons for success or failure, that is, the internal connections of things, its development laws, and this reason, internal connections, and development laws are what we call "perfect" (rational knowledge).
    From this, it can be seen that without "practice", that is, without rich practical experience, without rich perceptual knowledge, "perfect" cannot be produced, and true rational knowledge cannot be obtained; however, only "practice", only practical experience, only perceptual knowledge, if not good at summarizing, not good at systematizing and organizing the existing practical experience, it is like a person eating food into the stomach without digestion, still can not get any nutrition, still can not produce "perfect", still can not get rational knowledge.
    From this, it can be seen that actively participating in the practical activities of socialist construction and being good at summarizing the experience of various practical activities is the most effective way to improve people's ideological, political, cultural and technical level. People do the same work or study, some people make progress very quickly, while others make progress very slowly. What is the reason? It lies in whether they are good at summarizing practical experience. People who are good at summarizing experience will make progress quickly, and people who are not good at summarizing experience will make progress slowly. This is a truth that has been repeatedly proved by the practice of daily life. Here, I might as well cite a recent example that is well known to everyone to illustrate it, that is, Comrade Rong Guotuan, the Chinese athlete who won the world men's singles title in the 1959 World Table Tennis Championships. He is very young, and he liked table tennis in middle school. He often studies and practices hard, and has competed with domestic and foreign table tennis players more than once, which shows that he is quite "familiar" with the sport of table tennis. However, the reason why he was able to win the title of world men's singles champion in this World Table Tennis Championships, in addition to his "practice", is more importantly because he was able to summarize his experience in the competition with his opponents in a timely manner, both successful and unsuccessful experience, so that he could timely produce the "perfect" to defeat the opponent.

    熟能生巧

    语云：“熟能生巧”。所谓“熟”就是说人们对于客观事物接触的多或操作（表演）的多的意思，譬如说，人们的耳朵听的多了，声音就“熟”，人们的眼睛看的多了，颜色或形状就“熟”，等等；所谓“巧”就是说人们能够知道客观事物的奥妙和窍门，从而能够干得又多又快又好又省，而且不大容易发生失误的意思，譬如说，我们常常看到那些手艺熟练的工人和工夫到家的艺术家，干起活来或者表演起艺术来，常常是得心应手，巧夺天工，万无一失。
    “熟能生巧”这几个字，如果我们用哲学的用语来解释的话，所谓“熟”是指的事物的量变，所谓“巧”是指的事物的质变。“熟”是人们对于客观事物的现象、形式的不断地接触、感觉，是人们对于客观事物的感性知识；“巧”是人们对于客观事物的本质、内容、内在联系、发展规律的认识和理解，是人们对于客观事物的理性知识。
    那么，“熟”怎样才“能生”出“巧”来呢？在人们对于客观事物的认识和操作（表演）技能方面，从“熟”到“巧”有一个它自己所特有的发展（加工）过程。这个特殊的发展过程，通常我们把它叫做对于社会实践经验
  （成功的经验，尤其是不成功的经验）的总结。那么，什么叫做经验总结，并且怎样去进行经验总结呢？所谓经验总结，就是人们对于某种反复进行的社会实践的结果（不管它是成功的还是失败的），加以具体的马克思列宁主义的分析，找出成功或者失败的原因，即事物的内在联系，它的发展规律，而这种原因、内在联系、发展规律就是我们所说的“巧”（理性知识）。
    由此可见，不“熟”，即没有丰富的实践经验，没有丰富的感性知识，固然生不出“巧”来，固然得不到真正的理性知识；但是，光“熟”，光有实践经验，光有感性知识，如果不善于总结，不善于把已有的实践经验加以条理化，系统化，那就像一个人把饭吃到肚子里没有消化一样，仍然得不到什么营养，仍然生不出“巧”来，仍然得不到理性知识。
    由此可见，积极地参加社会主义建设的实践活动，并且善于总结各种实践活动的经验，是提高人们的思想政治、文化技术水平的最有效的途径。人们同样地进行工作或者学习，有些人进步的很快，有些人进步的却很慢，原因何在呢？在于善于不善于总结实践的经验。善于总结经验的人，进步的就会快，不善于总结经验的人，进步的就会慢。这是一条由日常生活的实践屡次证明的真理。在这里，我不妨举一个大家所共知的最近的例子，来加以说明，那就是在1959年世界乒乓球锦标赛中，荣获了男子单打世界冠军的我国选手容国团同志。他的年纪很轻，他在中学时代就爱好乒乓球这项运动。他经常地勤学苦练，并且不止一次地同国内和国外的乒乓球选手进行过比赛，这说明他对乒乓球这个运动项目是相当“熟”的。但是他这次在世界乒乓球锦标赛中，所以能够荣获男子单打世界冠军的称号，除了他打的“熟”以外，更重要的还是由于他能够及时地总结了他在同他的对手的比赛中的经验，成功的和不成功的经验，从而能够及时地生出了战胜对方的“巧”的缘故。
