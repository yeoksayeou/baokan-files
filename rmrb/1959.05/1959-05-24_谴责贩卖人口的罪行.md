    Condemn the Crime of Trafficking in Human Beings
    By People's Daily Commentator
    The Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea issued a statement on May 22, solemnly condemning the "immigration" conspiracy of the Syngman Rhee clique and resolutely demanding that the Syngman Rhee clique immediately cease this criminal act of betraying the interests of the nation and hand over all the South Korean people they want to forcibly exile to foreign countries to North Korea. This just stand of the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea reflects the common will of all the Korean people in the North and South.
    The "immigration" conspiracy frantically pursued by the Syngman Rhee clique in collusion with US imperialism is actually selling South Korean residents in large numbers to foreign capitalists and farm owners as slaves. Those being sold are mainly the unemployed in South Korea, retired soldiers of the Syngman Rhee army, and residents of North Korea who were abducted by US imperialism and the Syngman Rhee clique during the war. Since the Syngman Rhee clique announced the "Overseas Immigration Committee Ordinance" on May 11, the Korean people have expressed great anger. Nearly 400,000 people in the capitals of North Korean provinces and Kaesong City held rallies and demonstrations to protest the heinous conspiracy of US imperialism and the Syngman Rhee clique, raising their arms and shouting: "US troops get out of South Korea!" "For the peaceful reunification of the motherland, let us all mobilize!" To stop the Syngman Rhee clique's crime of trafficking in human beings, we resolutely demand that the South Korean authorities send all those who are to be sold to foreign countries to North Korea. We are convinced that all peace-loving and justice-minded people in the world will support and support this just struggle of the Korean people.
    This is not the first time that the Syngman Rhee clique has colluded with the United States to traffic in South Korean people. According to statistics, the Syngman Rhee clique forcibly sold 2,265 South Koreans to foreign countries under the name of so-called "special immigration" between 1954 and 1958. According to a report by the Seoul Toyo News Agency, since the beginning of this year, the Syngman Rhee clique has sold 1,191 South Korean orphans to the United States. The recently announced so-called "Overseas Immigration Committee Ordinance" is nothing more than a criminal plan to sell South Koreans to foreigners as slaves on a larger scale. What are the excuses of the United States and the Syngman Rhee clique for trafficking in South Korean people? South Korea has "overpopulation," but this deceptive nonsense cannot conceal the truth. When the United States first occupied South Korea, it shamelessly said that it would build South Korea into a "democratic showcase" of the free world; but fourteen years later, the brutal rule and plunder of South Korea by the United States and the Syngman Rhee clique have left South Korea impoverished and its economy bankrupt. At present, South Korea's industrial production level has been reduced to half of what it was during the Japanese rule, and 6.6 million unemployed and semi-unemployed people are wandering the streets, selling their children, and wailing everywhere. The year-by-year reduction in agricultural production has turned South Korea, which is known as the granary, into a land of hunger. It can be seen that the current disaster of the South Korean people is precisely the result of the vicious colonial rule implemented by the US imperialist aggressors in South Korea for more than ten years.
    In sharp contrast to this tragic and appalling phenomenon in South Korea, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has achieved great success in socialist construction. An unprecedented prosperous scene has emerged in North Korea, the people's happy life is improving day by day, and hunger and unemployment have long been eliminated. The Republic's government cannot ignore the deep misfortune imposed on the South Korean people by US imperialism and the Syngman Rhee clique. It has extended a warm hand of rescue to the South Korean people, has made all preparations for the return of compatriots suffering in Japan, and is prepared to take in and help all South Korean unemployed, displaced farmers and orphans to build a new life and jointly build a socialist new Korea.
    As the statement of the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea pointed out, the only way to get all the South Korean people out of their current tragic situation is to strive for the early realization of the peaceful reunification of North and South Korea and drive US imperialism out of South Korea. Obviously, the Syngman Rhee clique's criminal act of trafficking in human beings will further unite all the Korean people to fight for the peaceful reunification of the motherland.

    谴责贩卖人口的罪行
    本报评论员
    朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府5月22日发表声明，严正谴责李承晚集团的“移民”阴谋，并且坚决要求李承晚集团立即停止这一背叛民族利益的犯罪行为，把他们想要强迫放逐到外国去的南朝鲜人民全部交给朝鲜北部。朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府这一正义立场，反映了南北朝鲜全体人民的共同意志。
    李承晚集团勾结美帝国主义疯狂推行的“移民”阴谋，实际上是在把南朝鲜居民大批出卖给外国资本家和农场主当奴隶。被出卖的，主要是南朝鲜的失业者、李承晚军队的退伍军人以及战争期间被美帝国主义和李承晚集团劫走的朝鲜北部居民。李承晚集团在5月11日公布“海外移民委员会法令”以后，朝鲜人民表示极大的愤怒。朝鲜北部各道首府和开城市等地近四十万群众举行集会和示威游行，抗议美帝国主义和李承晚集团的罪恶阴谋，振臂高呼：“美军从南朝鲜滚出去！”“为了祖国的和平统一，大家一致动员起来！”制止李承晚集团贩卖人口的罪行，坚决要求南朝鲜当局把要卖往外国的所有的人都送到朝鲜北部。我们确信，全世界爱好和平和正义的人民都将支持和声援朝鲜人民的这一正义斗争。
    李承晚集团勾结美国贩卖南朝鲜人口，这已不是第一次了。据统计，李承晚集团在1954年到1958年期间，就曾经在所谓“特别移民”的名义下，强把二千二百六十五名南朝鲜人卖给外国。据汉城东洋通讯社报道，今年以来，李承晚集团已把一千一百九十一名南朝鲜孤儿卖给了美国。最近公布的所谓“海外移民委员会法令”，不过是为了更大规模地推行把南朝鲜人卖给外国人当奴隶的罪恶计划。美国和李承晚集团贩卖南朝鲜人口的借口是什么南朝鲜“人口过剩”，可是这种骗人的胡说，是掩盖不了事实真相的。美国在最初占领南朝鲜的时候，曾大言不惭地说要把南朝鲜建成为自由世界的“民主橱窗”；但十四年后，美国和李承晚集团对南朝鲜的残暴统治和掠夺，使得南朝鲜民穷财尽，经济破产。目前南朝鲜工业生产水平已降低到日本统治时期的一半，六百六十万失业和半失业者流浪街头、鬻儿卖女，哀鸿遍野。农业的逐年减产，更使这号称粮仓的南朝鲜变成了饥饿之乡。由此可见，造成南朝鲜人民目前的灾难的，正是美帝国主义侵略者十几年来在南朝鲜实行的恶毒的殖民统治。
    同南朝鲜这种悲惨和骇人听闻的现象形成鲜明的对照，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国在社会主义建设中取得了巨大成就。朝鲜北部出现了从未有过的繁荣景象，人民的幸福生活日益提高，早已消灭了饥饿和失业。共和国政府对于美帝国主义和李承晚集团强加在南朝鲜人民身上的深重不幸，不能置之不理。它向南朝鲜人民伸出了温暖的拯救之手，已为在日本受苦受难的侨胞归国做好了一切准备，并且准备收留和帮助南朝鲜所有失业者、颠沛流离的农民和孤儿建立新生活，共同建设社会主义的新朝鲜。
    正如朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府的声明所指出的，要使所有南朝鲜人民摆脱目前这种悲惨处境，只有争取早日实现南北朝鲜的和平统一，把美帝国主义赶出南朝鲜。显然，李承晚集团贩卖人口的罪恶勾当，必将使全朝鲜人民进一步团结起来，为实现祖国的和平统一而斗争。
