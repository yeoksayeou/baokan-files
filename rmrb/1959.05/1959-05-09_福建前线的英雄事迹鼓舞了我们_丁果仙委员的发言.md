　　Fujian Frontline Heroes’ Deeds Inspire Us
    Speech by Committee Member Ding Guoxian

    Chairman, fellow committee members:
    In the new situation of the all-round Great Leap Forward in socialist construction in our great motherland, our country is simultaneously convening the National People's Congress and the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference. This meeting is being held at a time when our people's democratic dictatorship is more consolidated and the people's democratic united front is further expanded. Through this meeting, the development of our country's socialist construction will undoubtedly be further accelerated. We are excited about this! We cheer for this!
    I fully endorse the reports made to the conference by Premier Zhou and Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, as well as Vice Chairman Li Weihan, and resolutely implement them.
    Recently, the reactionary clique of the upper strata of the former Tibetan local government launched a rebellion. The State Council ordered the dissolution of the former Tibetan local government and thoroughly quelled the Tibetan rebellion. I firmly support the State Council's measure to prevent our country's sacred territory from being occupied by foreign countries.
    Shanxi Province organized a delegation to visit Fujian in February this year. I accompanied the delegation to the Fujian front for a performance of consolation. Now I will talk about some personal experiences during the consolation visit. During the visit, I personally saw that under the leadership of the Party, the Party, government, army, and people on the Fujian front were united as one, and for the sake of the country's construction, for the liberation of Jinmen, Mazu, Penghu and Taiwan, and for the defense of the country's borders, they were bravely annihilating the Chiang Kai-shek bandits. There are so many amazing deeds that they are innumerable. For example, one night, the Chiang Kai-shek bandits provoked our army in a certain place. Our scouts and militiamen, in a small boat, braved the cold and danger, traveled dozens of miles at night, skillfully dealt with the enemy's interrogation, penetrated deep into the enemy's stronghold, and cleverly and bravely eliminated the enemy's sentry post, capturing a platoon of them, and returned victoriously to their original place. This powerfully struck at the arrogance of the Chiang Kai-shek bandits and defended the national defense and the production and construction of the people on the front line.
    In addition, there are many heroic deeds of the broad masses of people on the Fujian front supporting the front. For example, the "Ten Sisters," "Seven Aunts," "Five Girls," and "Little Eighth Route Army," "Mu Guiying," "Zhao Yiman" and other support-the-front hero teams not only cooked and washed clothes for the soldiers, ensuring that the soldiers ate and dressed well, but also cooperated with the army to hold guns to encircle and annihilate the Chiang Kai-shek bandits. All these iron facts show that our unified and united motherland has unparalleled powerful strength, which will surely consolidate national defense and liberate our country's Jinmen, Mazu, Penghu and Taiwan. The US imperialism's occupation of our country's territory is tantamount to putting a noose around its own neck, and it will inevitably eat its own bitter fruit.
    The heroic deeds on the Fujian front moved me greatly. I received an extremely profound political education, which further made me realize the great significance of literature and art serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers. Especially seeing the amazing achievements of the soldiers and the broad masses of people uniting as one and seizing the opportunity to carry out production and construction in the battle to defend the country's borders, it encouraged us even more. These great achievements powerfully show that the motherland, whether in the interior, the frontier, or in every corner, presents a Great Leap Forward atmosphere with each passing day. Any enemy's attempt to belittle our construction achievements is a waste of effort. At the same time, I also deeply realized that without the leadership of our Party and the heroic commanders and fighters of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, and the heroic fighting of the broad masses of people on the frontier, there would be no consolidated national defense, no peaceful socialist construction, and no happy and fulfilling lives for us. Therefore, we sincerely thank them and actively support them. How can we support the heroic army and heroic people on the front line? First of all, we must put politics in command, improve our own political and ideological awareness, learn from their communist virtues of sacrificing personal interests for the country and the people, and be sure to widely convey the heroic feats of the military and civilians on the Fujian front that I have seen and heard to the people in the interior of the country, so that the people of the country can understand that our happiness is being defended by them, and we must vigorously support them; secondly, comparing ourselves with their heroic deeds, we are far inferior to them in terms of work, study, etc., especially in the peaceful life in the interior, we still lack the spirit of overcoming difficulties and working hard. Therefore, we must take their brave and tenacious fighting spirit as the driving force for our work, ensure that we do our job well, continue to study hard and practice hard, improve the level of dramatic art, implement the policy of letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend, and promote the new, express the various heroic miracles created by our people through literature and art, serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and sing for socialist construction; at the same time, we must impart all the art I have learned to our successors—the new theatrical and literary teams—without reservation, to support the Fujian front with practical actions, and to support the liberation of our country's territories of Jinmen, Mazu, Penghu and Taiwan!
    I wish the conference a victorious success and all the committee members good health!

### 福建前线的英雄事迹鼓舞了我们  丁果仙委员的发言

　　福建前线的英雄事迹鼓舞了我们
    丁果仙委员的发言主席、各位委员：
    在我们伟大的祖国社会主义建设全面大跃进的新形势下，我们国家同时召开了全国人民代表大会和政协全国委员会。这个会议是在我国人民民主专政更加巩固和人民民主统一战线更加扩大时召开的。通过这次会议，将无疑地进一步地加速我国的社会主义建设事业的发展。我们为此而兴奋！为此而欢呼！
    我完全拥护周总理和李富春、李先念二位副总理以及李维汉副主席等向大会所作的报告，并且坚决贯彻执行。
    最近原西藏地方政府上层反动集团发动叛乱，国务院命令解散原西藏地方政府，彻底平息西藏叛乱。我坚决拥护国务院这一使我国神圣的领土不为外国侵占的措施。
    山西省于今年二月份组织赴福建的慰问团，我随同慰问团到福建前线进行了慰问演出，现在就慰问过程中的见闻谈一些个人的体会。在慰问期间，我亲眼看到了在党的领导下福建前线的党政军民像一个人一样，团结一致，为了祖国的建设，为了解放金门、马祖、澎湖和台湾，保卫祖国的边防，英勇歼击着蒋匪军。许许多多的惊人事迹，真是不胜枚举。比如有一夜，蒋匪军向我军某地挑衅。我侦察员与民兵合乘小舟，不怕风寒与惊险，夜行数十浬，巧妙地应付过敌人盘查，深入敌据点，机智、勇敢地消灭了敌军岗哨，俘虏了他们一个排，胜利地返回原地。这就有力的打击了蒋匪军的气焰，保卫了国防，保卫了前线人民的生产建设。
    此外，福建前线的广大人民群众支前的英雄事迹，也是很多很多的。比如“十姐妹”、“七大娘”、“五姑娘”和“小八路”、“穆桂英”、“赵一曼”等支前英雄队，她们不仅给战士们做饭、洗衣，保证战士们吃好穿好，而且协同军队持枪围歼蒋匪军。所有这些铁的事实，都说明我们统一团结的祖国有无比强大的力量，一定能够巩固国防，一定能够解放我国的金门、马祖、澎湖和台湾。美帝国主义霸占我国领土，等于把绞索套在自己脖子上，必然要自食其果。
    福建前线的英雄事迹对我感动很大。使我受到了一次极其深刻的政治教育，从而进一步体会到文艺必须为工农兵服务的重大意义。尤其是看到了战士们同广大人民群众团结一致，在保卫祖国边防的战斗中，抓紧时机进行生产建设的惊人成就，更加鼓舞了我们。这些伟大的成就，有力地表明了祖国不论在内地、前沿以及各个角落，都呈现了一日千里的大跃进气象，任何敌人妄想贬低我们的建设成就，都是枉费心机。同时，也深深体会到，没有我们党的领导与英雄的陆海空三军指战员同志和前沿广大人民群众的英勇战斗，就没有我们巩固的国防，也没有社会主义的和平建设，更没有我们美满幸福的生活。因此，我们衷心地感谢他们，并且积极支援他们。如何来支援前线英雄的军队和英雄的人民呢？首先，必须政治挂帅，提高自己的政治思想觉悟，学习他们为祖国为人民不惜牺牲个人利益的共产主义品德，一定要把我所见到、听到的福建前线军民的丰功伟绩，广泛地传达给祖国内地的人民，让祖国人民都了解我们的幸福是他们在保卫着，我们必须大力支援他们；其次，以他们的英雄事迹来和自己对比，不论在工作、学习等方面都远不及他们，特别是在内地和平生活中，还缺乏克服困难、艰苦工作的精神，因此，要把他们的勇敢、坚韧的战斗精神作为推动自己工作的动力，保证做好岗位工作，继续勤学苦练，提高戏剧艺术水平，贯彻百花齐放、百家争鸣、推陈出新的方针，通过文艺表现我国人民所创造的各种英雄奇迹，为工农兵服务，为社会主义建设而歌唱；同时，要将我所学到的一切艺术毫不保留地传授给我们的接班人——新生的戏剧文艺队伍，以实际行动支援福建前线，支援解放我们祖国的领土金门、马祖、澎湖和台湾！
    祝大会胜利成功，各位委员身体健康！
