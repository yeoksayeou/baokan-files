    Launch a Nationwide Increase Production and Practice Economy Campaign
    ——Celebrating International Labor Day
    Today, the people of China are filled with joy and enthusiasm, joining the working people of the world in celebrating the annual International Labor Day. Three days ago, the First Session of the Second National People's Congress successfully concluded. This conference concentratedly embodied the unprecedented unity of all ethnic groups in our country, summarized the brilliant achievements our country has made in the Great Leap Forward on the political, economic, and cultural fronts, and proposed the 1959 program for developing the national economy. Six hundred and fifty million Chinese people are now united, full of confidence, under the leadership of the great Chinese Communist Party and the wise leader Comrade Mao Zedong, striving to fulfill and overfulfill the 1959 national economic plan and for the rapid development of our country's socialist construction.
    This year's national economic development plan is a plan for continued leap forward. This plan takes into account both the objective possibilities of our country's technical and material conditions and the subjective initiative of our people's revolutionary drive; it takes into account the requirements of mutual adaptation of the various sectors of the national economy in development, and adheres to the principle that construction must have priorities, must prioritize the development of heavy industry, especially the development of raw materials, fuel, and materials industries, and take steel as the key link. The realization of this plan will further consolidate and develop the material foundation of our country's socialism, and further improve the material and cultural living standards of our people. This plan fully conforms to the greatest interests of our people and reflects the urgent demands of our people.
    In order to successfully complete and overfulfill the 1959 national economic plan, the First Session of the Second National People's Congress called for another nationwide increase production and practice economy campaign. Increasing production and practicing economy is the basic method of building socialism in a more, faster, better, and more economical way. The increase production and practice economy campaign is a mass movement in economic work that our people are most familiar with. Vigorously launching the increase production and practice economy campaign is the best way to universally and effectively mobilize the construction enthusiasm of various departments and people in different positions. We must respond to the call of the First Session of the Second National People's Congress, immediately mobilize, and actively participate in this movement. We must fully exert our initiative and creativity, and display great wisdom and courage, on the premise of correctly assessing and mastering the existing material and technical foundation, and within the limits permitted by objective laws, maximize our subjective initiative, and strive to produce more and better industrial and agricultural products with the existing material, financial, and human resources, complete more and better construction work, and accomplish more and better things.
    The purpose of the increase production and practice economy campaign is to fully tap the potential of production equipment, raw materials, materials, funds, and labor, improve labor productivity, increase output, improve quality, and reduce costs. All sectors of the national economy have made great progress in last year's anti-waste and anti-conservatism campaign. However, the possibility of technological progress is infinite. We must never think that the production potential has been exhausted and there is nothing left to tap. For example, in the iron and steel industry, in the first quarter of this year, the average daily iron output per cubic meter of volume in large blast furnaces nationwide was 1.4 tons, while advanced blast furnaces reached 2.15 tons; the average daily steel output per square meter of hearth area in open-hearth furnaces nationwide was 7.3 tons, while advanced open-hearth furnaces reached 13 tons. According to the existing equipment capacity, if the utilization efficiency of blast furnaces in large and medium-sized iron and steel plants across the country is increased by 0.1 tons, the annual increase in pig iron production will be more than 600,000 tons; if the utilization efficiency of open-hearth furnaces is increased by 1 ton, the annual increase in steel production will also be more than 600,000 tons. The iron and steel industry has this difference between advanced and general, and this difference also universally exists in other sectors of the national economy. The existence of this difference precisely shows that the potential for increasing production and practicing economy in various sectors of the national economy is very large and there is much to be done. Therefore, no matter when, we must not be satisfied with the achievements we have already made. We must constantly learn from advanced units and advanced individuals, and try every means to find ways to increase production and practice economy.
    The specific requirements and ways to increase production and practice economy are different among different departments. However, no matter which department, which enterprise, or which people's commune, it must take technological innovation and technological revolution as the central content of carrying out the increase production and practice economy campaign. The main tasks of technological innovation and technological revolution are to reform equipment and tools, reform production processes and operating methods, reform product design, reform labor organization, and reform business management methods. In the increase production and practice economy campaign, adhering to technological innovation and technological revolution can achieve the unity of increasing production and practicing economy, the unity of quantity and quality, and the unity of more, faster, better, and more economical. The development of production technology is endless, and people's understanding of the objective laws of production technology development will gradually become comprehensive and profound. With the continuous development of science and technology, and with the continuous improvement of people's technical and cultural levels, the decisive role of technological innovation and technological revolution in production will become increasingly prominent. Our current task is to do our best to make technology serve the cause of socialist construction more and better.
    Every enterprise, every factory, every mine, every people's commune, every dock, every workshop should, on the basis of last year's actual situation, and according to its own existing equipment capacity, production conditions, plus people's subjective initiative, formulate its first-step production plan, its goals, sit firmly on this position, and advance steadily, steadily win this victory. Then, according to the subjective and objective possibilities, add the equipment, tools, etc. that can be obtained, continue to exert great effort, and strive for greater achievements.
    At present, the socialist red flag emulation campaign on the industrial production front, with technological innovation and technological revolution as its content, the large-area high-yield emulation campaign on the agricultural front, the fast construction movement with more, faster, better, and more economical on the capital construction front, the emulation campaign on the transportation front with reasonable multi-haul and multi-load, fast loading and unloading, safety and punctuality as the main content, and the "six-good" red flag movement on the commercial front with promoting production, implementing policies, completing plans, improving business management, improving service quality, and marching towards becoming both red and expert as its content, are all increase production and practice economy campaigns that adapt to the different tasks, different characteristics, and different forms of each front. Universally carrying out and deepening these different forms of emulation campaigns in various enterprises, institutions, and people's communes will surely achieve more brilliant achievements on the economic front.
    The great victories that our people of all ethnic groups have achieved and will achieve have aroused strong reactions internationally. "Those who are close are happy, and those who are hostile are pained" can summarize everything. Imperialism and all reactionary forces are trying every means to prevent our people from advancing victoriously. They have carried out various conspiracies and sabotage activities and have shamelessly slandered and defamed the Chinese people. Recently, they have even taken advantage of the rebellion of a small handful of upper-class reactionary elements in Tibet to frantically interfere in our country's internal affairs, vainly attempting to split the Tibetan region from the big family of the motherland. This is tolerable, but what is intolerable! We must carry out resolute counterattacks and thoroughly smash any conspiracy of imperialism and all foreign interventionists!
    Resolutely opposing imperialism, loving the motherland, and being diligent and brave are the traditional virtues of the Chinese people. Today, while celebrating International Labor Day, let us raise even higher the banner of opposing imperialism and foreign reactionaries' interference in China's internal affairs, let us further promote the spirit of patriotism, let us exert even greater effort, launch the increase production and practice economy campaign, and use practical actions to accelerate the socialist construction of the motherland to counter the provocations of foreign interventionists!

    全民动员展开增产节约运动
    ——庆祝五一国际劳动节
    今天，全中国人民喜气洋洋，热情鼎沸，同全世界劳动人民一道，欢庆一年一度的五一国际劳动节。三天以前，第二届全国人民代表大会第一次会议已胜利闭幕，这个大会集中地体现了我国各族人民的空前大团结，总结了我国在政治、经济和文化战线上大跃进中所取得的光辉成就，并且提出了1959年发展国民经济的纲领。六亿五千万中国人民现正团结一致，满怀信心地在伟大的中国共产党和英明领袖毛泽东同志领导下，为完成和超额完成1959年国民经济计划，为我国社会主义建设事业的飞速发展而奋斗。
    今年的国民经济发展计划是一个继续跃进的计划。这个计划既考虑了我国技术物资条件的客观可能性，又考虑了我国人民革命干劲的主观能动性；既考虑了国民经济各部门在发展中互相适应的要求，又坚持了建设必须有重点、必须优先发展重工业、首先是发展原料、燃料、材料工业和以钢为纲的方针。实现了这个计划，我国社会主义的物质基础将得到进一步的巩固和发展，我国人民的物质生活和文化生活水平将得到进一步的提高。这个计划完全符合于我国人民的最大利益，反映了我国人民的迫切要求。
    为了胜利地完成和超额完成1959年的国民经济计划，第二届全国人民代表大会第一次会议号召在全国范围内再一次地掀起一个全民性的增产节约运动。增产节约是多快好省地建设社会主义的基本方法，增产节约运动是我国人民最熟悉的经济工作中的群众运动。大搞增产节约运动，是普遍地有效地调动各个部门、各种不同岗位人员的建设积极性的最好办法。我们一定要响应第二届全国人民代表大会第一次会议的号召，立刻动员起来，踊跃地投身到这个运动中去。我们要在正确估量和掌握现有的物质技术基础的前提下，充分发挥主动精神和创造精神，发挥大智大勇，在客观规律所允许的范围内，最大限度地发挥我们的主观能动作用，力争在现有物力、财力和人力的条件下，生产更多更好的工农业产品，完成更多更好的建设工作量，办出更多更好的事情来。
    增产节约运动的目的，是充分挖掘生产设备、原料、材料、资金和劳动力的潜力，提高劳动生产率，增加产量，提高质量，降低成本。国民经济各部门，在去年的反浪费反保守运动中都取得了巨大的进步。但是，技术进步的可能性是无限的。我们决不能认为生产潜力已经挖完了，没得可挖的了。例如钢铁工业，今年第一季度，全国大高炉每立方公尺容积每昼夜的产铁量，平均为一点四吨，而先进的高炉却达到了二点一五吨；全国平炉每一平方公尺炉底面积每昼夜的产钢量，平均为七点三吨，而先进的平炉却达到了十三吨。按照现有设备能力，全国大中型钢铁厂高炉利用效率每提高零点一吨，全年就可以增产生铁六十多万吨；平炉的利用效率每提高一吨，全年也可以增产钢六十多万吨。钢铁工业有这种先进和一般的差别，国民经济其它部门内也普遍存在着这种差别。这种差别的存在，正说明了国民经济各部门的增产节约的潜力是很大的，是大有可为的。因此，不管什么时候，我们都不要满足于已经取得的成就。我们要不断地向先进单位、先进人物学习，要千方百计地找寻增产节约的门路。
    增产节约的具体要求和门路，在各个部门之间是不一样的。但是，不论哪一个部门，哪一个企业，哪一个人民公社，都必须以技术革新和技术革命作为开展增产节约运动的中心内容。技术革新和技术革命的主要工作，就是改革设备和工具，改革生产工艺和操作方法，改革产品设计，改革劳动组织，改革经营管理方法。在增产节约运动中，坚持技术革新和技术革命，就可以做到增产和节约的统一，做到数量和质量的统一，做到多快好省的统一。生产技术的发展是无穷无尽的，人们对生产技术发展的客观规律的认识，是会逐渐全面和深刻的。随着科学技术的不断发展，随着人们的技术水平和文化水平的不断提高，技术革新和技术革命在生产中的决定作用，也会越来越突出。我们当前的任务，就是要尽力使技术为社会主义建设事业更多更好的服务。
    每一个企业、每一个工厂、每一个矿山、每一个人民公社、每一个码头、每一个作坊，都应当在去年实际的基础上，根据自己现有的设备能力、生产条件，再加上人的主观能动性，制定自己第一步的生产计划，奋斗目标，把屁股坐在这个阵地上面，稳步前进，稳步夺得这个胜利。然后再根据主观客观的可能性，增添可能得到的设备、工具等等，继续鼓足干劲，争取更大的成绩。
    目前，工业生产战线上的以技术革新和技术革命为内容的高产高质的社会主义红旗竞赛运动，农业战线上的大面积丰产的竞赛运动，基本建设战线上的多快好省的快速施工运动，运输战线上以合理的多拉多载、快装快卸、安全正点为主要内容的竞赛运动，以及商业战线上的以促进生产、执行政策、完成计划、改善经营管理、提高服务质量、向红专进军为内容的“六好”红旗运动，都是适应各个战线不同任务、不同特点、不同形式的增产节约运动。把这些不同形式的竞赛运动，分别在各个企业、事业单位、各个人民公社里普遍开展起来和深入下去，就一定能在经济战线上取得更加辉煌的成就。
    我国各族人民已经取得的和将要取得的巨大胜利，在国际上引起了强烈的反应，“亲者快，仇者痛”，六个字可以概括一切。帝国主义和一切反动势力千方百计企图阻挡我国人民胜利前进的道路。他们进行了各种阴谋和破坏活动，对中国人民进行了无耻的诬蔑、诽谤。最近他们更利用了西藏一小撮上层反动分子的叛变行为，疯狂地干涉我国的内政，妄想把西藏地方从祖国的大家庭中分裂出去。是可忍，孰不可忍！我们必须进行坚决的反击，彻底粉碎帝国主义和一切外国干涉者的任何阴谋活动！
    坚决反对帝国主义、热爱祖国、勤劳勇敢，这是中国人民的传统美德。今天，在庆祝五一国际劳动节的时候，让我们更高地举起反对帝国主义和外国反动派干涉中国内政的旗帜，让我们进一步地发扬爱国主义的精神，让我们鼓足更大的干劲，展开增产节约运动，以加速祖国社会主义建设的实际行动来回击外国干涉者的挑衅！
