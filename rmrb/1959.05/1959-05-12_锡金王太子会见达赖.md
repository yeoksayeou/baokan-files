Xinhua News Agency, Mussoorie, 11th. According to a report by the Indian Press Trust in Mussoorie on the 10th: Sikkim Prince Namgyal met with the Dalai Lama at Birla House in Mussoorie on the 10th. They were together for a few minutes. Afterwards, he held a two-hour talk with the Dalai Lama's "confidants" on the situation in Tibet. The report said that the specific details of the talks were not available. Namgyal has returned to Gangtok, the capital of Sikkim. He will probably go to Mussoorie again. Namgyal recently went to Japan to "seek assistance" in order to organize a so-called "group to aid the Tibetan people."

In addition, the Indian Press Trust also reported on the 10th that Bakula, the Grand Lama of the Ladakh region and Minister of the Kashmir State Government, has been in Mussoorie for the past four days, holding talks with "high-ranking Tibetan officials."
