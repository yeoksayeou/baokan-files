Xinhua News Agency, 6th. Prime Minister Ferenc Münnich and some members of the Hungarian Party and Government delegation he leads, accompanied by Liao Luyan, Minister of Agriculture of our country, and Hao Deqing, our country's ambassador to Hungary, visited the National Agricultural Exhibition this morning.

    The distinguished guests carefully viewed the exhibits of various crops in our country and were very interested in Golden Queen corn, millet, fruits, and tobacco. They also took a group photo in front of a large lion covered with tobacco leaves.

    Prime Minister Münnich wrote in the exhibition's commemorative album: "The exhibition reflects the unyielding will of the Chinese people, under the leadership of the Party and the government, to eliminate the remnants of the past that hindered development and to build socialism with greater enthusiasm and at a faster pace. The achievements of the Chinese people so far show that the goals they have set for themselves in the future will surely be achieved. We watch these historically significant labors with love and respect, and our socialist camp, headed by the Soviet Union, will guarantee the peace needed for this creative labor.

    This morning, delegation member and First Deputy Minister of Culture and Education of Hungary, Aczél György, visited Peking University.

    新华社6日讯　明尼赫·费伦茨总理和他率领的匈牙利党政代表团部分团员，今天上午由我国农业部部长廖鲁言和我国驻匈牙利大使郝德青等陪同，参观了全国农业展览会。
    贵宾们仔细地观看了我国各种农作物的展品，对金皇后玉米、小米、水果和烟叶很感兴趣，并且在用烟叶复盖着的大狮子前留影。
    明尼赫总理在展览会的纪念册上题词说：“展览会反映了中国人民在党和政府的领导下，力求消除过去阻碍发展的残余，以更大的热情、更快的速度建设社会主义的不屈不挠的意志。迄今为止，中国人民所取得的成绩表明他们今后所规定的目标也必然会达到。我们怀着热爱和尊敬注视着这些具有历史意义的劳动，以苏联为首的我们的社会主义阵营将会保证这种创造性的劳动所需要的和平。
