    Catching Insects
    Pei Shouquan
    The captain and several commune members returned from the street with night soil, already at eleven o'clock at night. As soon as they entered Huangjue Wan from the ditch entrance, they saw several spots of firelight flashing on the distant slope, and he couldn't help but say angrily, "These soft-shelled turtle eaters are really addicted to eating! Still wandering in the fields so late at night. Last night, whoever used torches to shine for soft-shelled turtles trampled down several seedlings, and we still don't know who did it!" As he spoke, he carried the night soil and strode forward. A commune member behind him shouted, "Captain, if you run so fast, the manure will spill! You'll have to scoop it up with your hands!" The captain ignored this, just paused to shift the load on his shoulder and said, "Hey! Tonight, we'll take this opportunity to educate these young kids, who only care about eating and not about the crops." "Chicken, fish, eggs, and noodles are no match for grilled soft-shelled turtle! Who doesn't like to eat it?" a commune member said jokingly. Everyone laughed at this.
    The captain continued to run forward, and everyone followed suit. Before long, they reached the place with the torches. He put down the manure buckets, just as he was about to go forward to find out what was happening, when he suddenly heard a very old voice singing, "Rice stem borer, don't be happy, the old man will send you to the Yellow Springs. Eliminate diseases and pests, and we'll ensure a bumper harvest forever." The captain recognized Wang Laohan's voice and was very surprised, thinking: How come old people are also using torches to catch soft-shelled turtles? He climbed onto the field ridge and took a closer look, only to see Wang Laohan walking back and forth in the newly planted pumpkin field in the paddy field. Still not understanding what they were looking for, he deliberately stepped forward and shouted loudly, "Who is it! What are you doing?" Wang Laohan recognized the captain's voice and coughed before finally responding, "It's me! Nothing."
    It turned out that Wang Laohan had been accumulating fertilizer for several nights in a row. Tonight, the weather was bad, and the captain repeatedly told him not to go, and he reluctantly agreed to rest at home. As soon as the captain left to carry night soil, he saw that the weather had suddenly turned cooler. Based on his experience, there would be many "rice stem borers" coming out to eat the vegetables tonight, so he invited several old people to come out to catch insects. Now, he was afraid that the captain would criticize him for not obeying labor discipline, so he drooped his hands and became very obedient.
    Seeing that they were consciously participating in labor, the captain walked over and shook his hand excitedly, saying, "Right! You're doing a great job, truly getting younger as you live!" Wang Laohan's wrinkled face twitched twice in the firelight, and he immediately said with a smile, "It should be so. This year's leap forward is even greater. The year's plan lies in spring, how can we bear to let pests eat the crops?" The captain said happily, "Uncle Wang, you..." Before he could finish speaking, the commune members had already picked up the manure buckets and left. Someone spontaneously composed a folk song and sang:
    You are old, but your hearts are not old,
    Your leap-forward spirit is truly remarkable,
    Wholeheartedly for the commune,
    Catching insects late at night to protect the seedlings.
    The Eight-Character Charter is all done,
    Grain production increase is ensured,
    Presenting gifts to the Party for National Day,
    You are all old heroes.
    The old men listened and stroked their beards, laughing and saying, "We dare not accept such praise! We dare not accept such praise!" The commune members carrying night soil also turned around and laughed. The night breeze carried their laughter and footsteps, softly and crisply, like a dream, drifting far, far away.

    捉虫
    裴寿全
    队长和几个社员从街上挑粪回来，已是深夜十一点钟了。刚从沟口进黄桷塆，就见远处坡上，有几处火光在闪，不由得他生气的念道：“这些吃黄鳝的，硬吃起瘾啦，这大晚上，还在田里转。昨晚打火把照黄鳝的，把秧子踩倒几窝，还不知是哪个踩的哩！”他一边说，一边担起粪大步大步的向前走。后面一个社员喊道：“队长，你跑那么快，把粪打泼了，要你用手捧起来哟！”队长没管这些，只是站着换了换肩说：“嘿！今晚趁这个机会，把这些青年娃儿教育一下，不顾庄稼只顾好吃。”“鸡鱼蛋面都不如火烧黄鳝啦，哪个不喜欢吃呀？”一个社员故意打趣的说。大家听了，都嘻嘻的笑。
    队长照样往前跑，大家也跟着跑起来。不一会拢了打火把的地方，他放下粪桶，正准备前去问个究竟，忽然听到一个老苍苍的声音在唱：“鲜巴虫，你莫鲜，老汉送你到黄泉，除掉病害和虫害，我们永远保丰年。”队长一听是王老汉的声音，很奇怪，心想：怎么老年人都在打火把照黄鳝呢？他爬上田坎仔细一看，只见王老汉在水田上面新栽的南瓜地里转来转去，但还是不了解他们在找什么，就故意上前大声喊：“谁呀！在干什么？”王老汉一听是队长，便咳一声嗽，好久才应道：“是我！没干什么。”
    原来王老汉接连几夜都在积肥，今晚天气不好，队长再三叫他不要去，他勉强答应在屋里休息。队长刚去担粪后，他见天气突然变得凉快，根据他的经验，今晚会有很多“鲜巴虫”出来吃菜，他就约了几个老年人出来捉虫。现在他怕队长批评他不遵守劳动纪律，軃着手，变得规规矩矩的。
    队长见他们自觉参加劳动，走过去很激动的握着他的手说：“对！你们作得好，真是越活越年青咧！”王老汉在火光下，打皱的脸动了两动，马上带着笑容说：“应该的嘛，今年跃进更大了，一年之计在于春，怎忍心让害虫把庄稼吃掉呢？”队长高兴的说：“王大伯，你……”他话还没说完，社员们已挑起粪桶走了，有人顺口编了一首山歌唱道：
    你们人老心不老，
    跃进气魄真不小，
    一心一意为公社，
    深夜捉虫把苗保。
    八字宪法都做到，
    粮食增产靠得牢，
    国庆向党把礼献，
    你们都是老英豪。
    老头们听了，捏着胡子笑起来，连忙说：“不敢当！不敢当！”担粪的社员们也回过头来笑，晚风吹着他们的笑声和脚步声，轻轻的，脆生生的，像梦一样，飘得老远老远。
