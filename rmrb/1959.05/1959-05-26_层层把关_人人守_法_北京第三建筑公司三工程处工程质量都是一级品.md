    Layer-by-layer Checks, Everyone Observes the "Law"
    The Third Engineering Office of the Beijing Third Construction Company Achieves First-Class Quality on All Projects

    According to a Xinhua News Agency dispatch, the Third Engineering Office of the Beijing Third Construction Company has established a complete set of quality supervision systems of “guarding six gates” and “observing six laws” by mobilizing the masses. As a result, everyone abides by operating procedures and each level tightly controls quality. In April, the six factories and one hospital they were responsible for constructing all achieved first-class construction quality after a joint inspection by relevant departments.

    This engineering office is undertaking nearly 100,000 square meters of construction projects this year. To ensure the quality of these projects, at the beginning of this year, the leaders of the engineering office repeatedly educated the workers on the importance of project quality. Based on the characteristics of the projects and the specific circumstances of the workers' technical levels, they mobilized the masses to formulate a set of quality inspection and supervision systems of "guarding six gates" and "observing six laws" from the bottom up.

    "Guarding six gates" means that, based on the main problems in the entire construction process of each project, six checkpoints are set up from construction preparation to completion, which are checked and supervised by workers, technicians, and leading cadres together, level by level. The specific contents are: 1. Construction Preparation Gate: Before construction begins, cadres, workers, and technicians jointly review the drawings and formulate construction plans, both to become familiar with the design requirements and to correct any deficiencies or errors in the design. 2. Key Parts Gate: Areas that are complex to construct or prone to quality accidents are designated as key parts of the project, and this is communicated to the team level. Workers discuss and formulate measures to ensure the excellent quality of these parts. 3. Reinforced Concrete Gate: Main materials such as steel and cement must pass tests before they can be used. Before and after pouring concrete, it must pass the inspection of full-time quality inspectors and technical directors before pouring or removing the formwork. 4. Component Lifting and Welding Acceptance Gate: Before component lifting or after welding, construction units and processing departments are jointly organized to inspect and accept. 5. Technical Learning Gate: The engineering office has organized training classes for electricians, steel workers, and other types of work, training new workers so that they can master the basic knowledge of each type of work in a short period of time. 6. What is particularly important is the establishment of a mass quality responsibility system gate, which implements an inspection system combining self-inspection, mutual inspection, and professional inspection agencies. Workers and team inspectors conduct self-inspections at any time, and the upper and lower work processes inspect each other. In addition, the site leaders and full-time quality inspectors inspect once every seven days; every ten days, the engineering office organizes workers, technicians, and leading cadres to hold a "three-way combination" quality inspection, and problems are resolved at any time.

    Complementing the "guarding six gates," the workers also formulated "six laws," which are to strengthen the study of drawings, do a good job of technical disclosure, compile and implement construction organization design, earnestly conduct technical inspections, do a good job of material testing, and carry out quality competitions. For more than two months, every morning, the various construction sites belonging to this engineering office have insisted on studying the design drawings for one hour. Technicians explain the requirements to the workers in detail according to the design requirements. After the workers learn the drawings, they have a clear understanding of the quality requirements, which has played a significant role in ensuring quality.

    The result of the continuous improvement of project quality quickly reversed the situation at the beginning of this year where the construction speed was slow and the costs were high due to the large amount of rework. According to statistics from this engineering office, in the two months after the implementation of the quality supervision system, compared with January and February of this year, the amount of work completed doubled, the first-class quality rate of the project increased from 80.9% to 100%, and the cost changed from a monthly loss in the past to a savings of more than 90,000 yuan.

### 层层把关  人人守“法”  北京第三建筑公司三工程处工程质量都是一级品

    层层把关  人人守“法”
    北京第三建筑公司三工程处工程质量都是一级品
    据新华社讯  北京市第三建筑工程公司第三工程处发动群众建立了“把六关”、“守六法”的一整套质量监督制度后，人人遵守操作规程，层层把紧质量关口。4月份，他们负责修建的六个工厂和一个医院，经过各有关部门的联合检查，建筑质量全部都是一级品。
    这个工程处今年承担了近十万平方公尺的建筑工程。为了保证这些工程的质量，今年年初，工程处领导上就向职工们反复进行了重视工程质量的教育；根据工程的特点和工人技术水平等具体情况，发动群众自下而上地制订了一套“把六关”、“守六法”的质量检查监督制度。
    “把六关”，就是根据每项工程整个建筑过程中的主要问题，从施工准备到建成，分设六道关口，由工人、技术人员、领导干部结合一起，加以检查监督，层层把守。它们的具体内容是：一、施工准备关。在动工兴建前，干部、工人、技术人员会审图纸和制订施工方案，一方面熟悉设计要求，同时也纠正了设计不周或错误的地方。二、关键部位关。在施工较复杂或容易发生质量事故的地方，列为工程中的关键部位，并层层下达到队组，工人们讨论制订措施，以确保这些部位的优良质量。三、钢筋混凝土关。钢筋、水泥等主要材料，要经过试验合格，才能使用；在浇灌混凝土前后，要经过专职质量检查员和技术主任的检查合格，才能进行浇灌或拆模。四、构件吊装、焊接验收关。在构件吊装前或焊接后，都组织建设单位和加工部门共同检查验收。五、技术学习关。工程处举办了电焊、钢筋等工种训练班、训练新工人，使他们在短期内能够掌握各个工种的基本知识。六、特别重要的是建立了群众性的质量责任制关，实行自检、互检和专业检查机构相结合的检查制度。工人和队组检查员随时自行检查，上下道工序相互检查。此外，每隔七天由工地领导人员和专职质量检查员检查一次；每隔十天由工程处组织工人、技术人员和领导干部举行一次“三结合”的质量大检查，发现问题，随时解决。
    和把紧“六关”相辅而行的，职工们还制订了“六法”，即加强图纸学习，作好技术交底，编制和贯彻施工组织设计，切实进行技术检查，作好材料试验，开展质量竞赛。两个多月来，这个工程处所属各个工地每天早晨都坚持学习设计图纸一个小时。技术人员按照设计要求详细地向工人交底。工人们学习图纸后，对质量要求了解得清清楚楚，在保证质量上起了很大作用。
    工程质量不断提高的结果，很快地扭转了这个工程处今年年初因为返工活多而造成的建设速度缓慢和成本增高的局面。据这个工程处统计，执行质量监督制度后的两个月，与今年1、2月份比较，完成的工作量增加了一倍，工程质量的一级品率由80.9％提高到100％，成本由过去的月月亏损变为节约了九万多元。（附图片）
