Gliding Sport

Gliding is the beginning of flight. Carrying out mass gliding activities can not only exercise people's bodies and cultivate courage and resourcefulness, but also select and train reserve forces for the aviation industry.

Gliders are divided into primary, intermediate, and advanced categories according to their performance. They do not have their own power and are generally towed into the air by winches, cars, or airplanes, and then rely on air currents to fly freely in the air. Primary and intermediate gliders do not fly very high or very far. Advanced gliders can fly very high (over 10,000 meters) and very far (800-900 kilometers), and can perform various complex flight maneuvers. Advanced gliders are divided into single-seat and two-seat types. In the six gliding competitions in Group A of the First National Games, single-seat advanced gliders will be used.

The six competition events for Group A gliding in the First National Games are also the main events in international competitions. During the competition, the gliders are towed to a height of 800 meters by an airplane for "release" (detachment from the airplane's tow), and then glide freely. In addition to carrying parachutes, athletes can also bring food, water, and oxygen supply equipment. These competitions require athletes to have a healthy body, skilled piloting techniques, a certain knowledge of meteorology, and navigation skills. The content of these six competition events is:

Endurance Time Flight

This is to see who can keep their glider in the air the longest. The time spent in the air is calculated from the time the glider "releases" in the air to the time it lands, and both takeoff and landing must be within the same airfield. Currently, the national record holder for men in this event in China is Song Handong from the People's Liberation Army, with a time of nine hours and ten minutes; the national record holder for women is Chai Shouru from the People's Liberation Army, with a time of six hours and sixteen minutes. Another female athlete from the People's Liberation Army, Shen Meizhen, created a better score of eight hours and nine minutes in March of this year, breaking the women's national record.

Altitude Gain Flight

This is to see whose glider flies the highest. This altitude is not calculated from the ground, but rather the actual altitude that the glider can gain after "release" in the air. This altitude can be determined by the "automatic altitude recorder" inside the glider. Currently, the national record holder for men in this event is Dong Xiang, with a score of 3,900 meters; the national record holder for women is Zhang Yirong, with a score of 3,000 meters. People's Liberation Army female athlete Li Xiuyun created a better score of 3,800 meters in March of this year.

Fifty Kilometer Round-Trip Speed Flight

This is to see whose glider has the fastest average speed in a fifty-kilometer round trip (25 kilometers out and 25 kilometers back). This competition will take off from the Liangxiang Chinese People's Aviation Club Airfield in Beijing, fly to Dongxianfeng Slope, 25 kilometers southwest of the airfield, and then fly back. When turning at Dongxianfeng Slope, a 360-degree turn must be made, and the altitude must not exceed 1,000 meters, so that the local ground referee can issue a signal authorizing the return flight.

One Hundred Kilometer Point-to-Point Speed Flight

This is to see whose glider has the fastest average speed when flying to a designated location 100 kilometers away. The designated location for this competition is Baoding, flying southwest from Liangxiang. Currently, the national record holder for men is Xu Guoan from the People's Liberation Army, with a speed of 24 kilometers per hour. In April of this year, he also created a new national record of 60.6 kilometers per hour. No national record has been created for women.

One Hundred Kilometer Triangular Course Speed Flight

This is also to see whose glider has the fastest average speed in flying 100 kilometers. However, it is not a direct-line flight, but a triangular course flight. The route for this competition is to take off from Liangxiang, pass through Zhuoxian County to the southwest, then pass through Gu'an County to the east, and then return to Liangxiang (it is also possible to pass through Gu'an first and then Zhuoxian). There are ground referees in Zhuoxian and Gu'an. The glider must make a 360-degree turn when flying there, and the altitude must not exceed 1,000 meters, before the referee can issue a signal authorizing continued flight.

Orientational Cross-Country Flight

This is to see whose glider flies the farthest in the designated direction. The designated direction for this competition is south. Since it is an orientational rather than a point-to-point flight, the end point of the flight can be considered wherever the glider lands. However, the distance flown is calculated as the straight line between the takeoff and landing points. Currently, the national record holder for men in this event is Zheng Yuefeng from the People's Liberation Army, with a score of 270 kilometers. No national record has been created for women.

    滑翔运动
    滑翔是飞行的开端。开展群众性的滑翔运动，不仅可以锻炼人们的身体和勇敢、机智的品质，还能为航空事业挑选和培养后备力量。
    滑翔机按照性能的不同，分为初、中、高级三类。它本身没有动力，一般是由绞盘车、汽车或飞机牵引起飞，然后靠气流在空中自由地飞翔。初、中级滑翔机飞得不太高，也不太远。高级滑翔机却能飞得很高（一万多公尺）和很远（八、九百公里），而且能做各种复杂的飞行动作。高级滑翔机分单座和双座两种。第一届全国运动会甲组滑翔竞赛的六项比赛中，都将采用单座高级滑翔机。
    第一届全运会上甲组滑翔竞赛的六个项目比赛也是国际比赛的主要项目。比赛时，滑翔机都是由飞机牵引到八百公尺的高度时进行“脱钩”（脱离飞机的牵引），然后再自由滑翔。运动员除携带降落伞外，还可以带食物、水和供氧设备等。这些比赛，要求运动员有健康的身体、熟练的驾驶技术、一定的气象知识和领航能力等。这六个项目比赛的内容是：
    续航时间飞行
    这是比谁驾驶的滑翔机在空中停留的时间最长。在空中停留的时间是指由滑翔机在空中“脱钩”时算起，到落地时止，并且起飞和降落都要在一个飞机场内。目前我国这个项目的男子全国纪录保持者是解放军选手宋汗栋，成绩九小时十分；女子全国纪录保持者是解放军选手柴寿儒，成绩六小时十六分。另一名解放军女选手沈美珍，今年3月间曾创造了八小时九分的更好成绩，突破女子全国纪录。
    升高高度飞行
    这是看谁的滑翔机飞得最高。这个高度不是由地面算起，而是计算滑翔机在空中“脱钩”后，实际能升高的高度。这个高度可以根据滑翔机内的“高度自动纪录仪”来得知。目前，这个项目的男子全国纪录保持者是董祥，成绩三千九百公尺；女子全国纪录保持者是张一蓉，成绩三千公尺。解放军女选手李秀云今年3月间创造了三千八百公尺的更好成绩。
    五十公里往返竞速飞行
    比滑翔机在五十公里往返中（去、回各二十五公里），谁的平均时速最快。这次比赛，是由北京良乡中国人民航空俱乐部飞机场起飞，到机场西南方二十五公里的东仙峰坡，然后再飞回来。到东仙峰坡转弯时必须作一个三百六十度的盘旋，并且高度不得超过一千公尺，这样，当地的地面裁判才发出准许返飞的信号。
    一百公里定点竞速飞行
    比滑翔机飞到一百公里以外的指定地点时，谁的平均时速最快。这次比赛的指定地点，是由良乡向西南飞到保定。目前，男子的全国纪录保持者是解放军选手徐国安，时速二十四公里。今年4月间，他又创造了时速六十点六公里的全国新成绩。女子还没有创造全国纪录。
  一百公里三角航线竞速飞行
    也是看滑翔机飞行一百公里的平均时速谁最快。但不是直航线的飞行，而是三角形航线的飞行。这次比赛的航线是从良乡起飞，向西南经涿县，再向东经固安县，然后返回良乡（也可以先经固安再过涿县）。在涿县和固安都有地面裁判，滑翔机飞到那里必须作一个三百六十度的盘旋，并且高度也不得超过一千公尺，裁判才发出准许继续飞行的信号。
    定向远航飞行
    这是看谁的滑翔机按指定方向飞得最远。这次比赛指定的方向是南方。由于是定向而不是定点飞行，所以滑翔机不论落在哪里都可以算是飞行的终点。但飞行的距离是按起飞和降落两点间的直线计算的。目前这个项目男子全国纪录的保持者是解放军选手郑岳峰，成绩二百七十公里。女子还没有创造全国纪录。　（新华社）
