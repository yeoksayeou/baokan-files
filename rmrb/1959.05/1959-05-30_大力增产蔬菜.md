Editorial: Vigorously Increase Vegetable Production

    Increasing vegetable production is an important task on the current agricultural production front in our country.

    Vegetables are important necessities in people's lives, and the relationship between vegetables and people's lives is very close. The quantity and quality of vegetables are often indicators of people's living standards. Therefore, making efforts to increase vegetable production and further meeting the people's need for vegetables is not only an important economic task but also an important political task.

    In recent years, under the advocacy of the Party and the state, all localities have attached great importance to vegetable production. Leading comrades in many regions have personally taken charge, convened meetings repeatedly to deploy vegetable production, and established specialized leading bodies to manage non-staple food production, establishing a relatively strong vegetable production front from top to bottom. This year, under the leadership of Party committees in various regions, the spring and summer vegetable sowing work has been completed in many areas, and the sowing area of spring and summer vegetables in many cities has increased significantly compared with last year. The spring and summer vegetable sowing area in Taiyuan City has increased from 40,000 mu last year to 90,000 mu this year. Precisely because various regions have taken a variety of practical and effective measures, the vegetable supply situation in many regions this year has been greatly improved compared with the past. Beijing supplied 39 million jin in April last year, increasing to 70 million jin in April this year, an increase of nearly 80%; Taiyuan increased from 7 liang per person per day in early May last year to 12 liang this year, also an increase of more than 70%; Guangzhou increased from half a jin per person per day last year to one jin this year, a full doubling.

    However, we cannot stop and be complacent with the achievements we have already made. In order to further improve the people's lives, we must continue to work hard and strive for greater achievements. After the great leap forward in industry and agriculture, the purchasing power of the people across the country has greatly increased, and the people's demand for vegetables has greatly increased. Many cities have also experienced rapid industrial development and a growing population, and new industrial and mining areas and new cities are continuously emerging. In light of all these circumstances, we must further grasp vegetable production, develop vegetable production at a faster pace, and strive to overcome the imbalances in vegetable production, strengthen weak links, and first of all, enable vegetable production in large cities to develop more rapidly, further meet the growing needs of the people across the country for vegetables, and meet the needs of the broad masses of people in cities and industrial and mining areas for vegetables.

    The vegetable production problems in large and medium-sized cities and industrial and mining areas occupy a particularly important position in the current overall vegetable production. Cities are our country's industrial bases, and the vast majority of all industrial products that we need in production and life are supplied by cities. Whether we can guarantee sufficient vegetable supplies for the vast number of workers and urban residents is a major issue directly related to the development of industry and a very important task for agriculture to support industrial development. Vegetable production in cities, especially large cities, must implement the policy of suburban areas serving the city and the policy of local production and local supply. That is to say, under the policy of ensuring self-sufficiency in urban vegetables, agricultural production in the near suburbs should "focus on vegetables." If grain, cotton, vegetables, and other crops can be taken care of at the same time, of course, they can be taken care of at the same time. If they cannot be taken care of at the same time, we must first ensure the development of vegetable production; it is all right if cotton, grain, and other crops do not conflict with vegetable production, but if conflicts arise, then we should first make way for vegetables. This is the only correct policy. Only by resolutely implementing this policy can vegetable production obtain the necessary labor force and the necessary means of production, thereby achieving self-sufficiency in urban vegetables. Wherever this policy is well implemented, the vegetable supply in that place will be very sufficient. It is hoped that all localities will pay close attention to this experience.

    To rapidly develop vegetable production in the suburbs of cities, we must resolutely implement the Party's policies, conscientiously carry out ideological education for farmers in the suburbs, and practically solve the specific problems of farmers in the suburbs in developing vegetable production. Urban Party committees should strengthen the education of worker-peasant alliance for vegetable farmers, raise the political and ideological awareness of vegetable farmers, and make vegetable farmers realize that developing vegetable production and supporting urban construction are the glorious responsibility of suburban farmers. At the same time, it is necessary to formulate practical methods to protect the legitimate interests of vegetable farmers, to purchase vegetables from vegetable farmers at reasonable prices, and to appropriately guarantee the supply of rations to vegetable farmers.

    Are we saying that rural vegetables are not important when we emphasize the development of vegetable production in the suburbs of cities? No. The rural population accounts for the vast majority of the country's population, and solving the problem of vegetable consumption for 500 million farmers is of course equally important. All things and all work are always interconnected and mutually constrained. If the rural vegetable problem is not solved well, the urban vegetable problem will still not be solved well. The phenomenon of urban vegetables "flowing back" to the countryside, which occurred in individual regions in the past, is a powerful illustration. Therefore, a policy that gives equal importance to urban and rural areas must be adopted to comprehensively solve the vegetable problem. When arranging vegetable production in people's communes, we must grasp both commercial vegetable production and self-sufficient vegetable production. We must arrange both aspects of production at the same time, otherwise it will affect the self-sufficiency of vegetables in the entire region.

    Vegetables are a major issue related to the lives of all people, a serious political issue. Party committees in all localities must mobilize the broad masses of peasants, conscientiously implement the Party's policies, and make our country's vegetable production achieve even greater development. Now is the peak growing season for spring and summer vegetables. Practical measures should be taken to ensure that spring and summer vegetables grow well. The sowing season for autumn vegetables will soon be upon us, and preparations for the sowing of autumn vegetables should be started as soon as possible, implemented at all levels, and resolutely grasp autumn vegetable production. In particular, cities that have not completed their spring and summer vegetable sowing plans must ensure that they complete and appropriately expand the sowing area of autumn vegetables to solve the problem of vegetable supply throughout the year.

### 大力增产蔬菜

    大力增产蔬菜
    增产蔬菜是当前我国农业生产战线上一个重要的任务。
    蔬菜是人们生活中的重要必需品，蔬菜同人民生活的关系是十分密切的。蔬菜的多少好坏，常常是衡量人们生活水平的标志之一。因此，努力增产蔬菜，进一步满足人民对蔬菜的需要，不仅是一个重要的经济工作，也是一项重要的政治任务。
    几年来在党和国家的倡导下，各地对蔬菜生产十分重视，很多地区的领导同志亲自出马挂帅，反复召开会议部署蔬菜生产，并且建立了专门管理副食品生产的领导机构，从上到下地建立起来了一条比较有力的蔬菜生产战线。今年在各地党委的领导下，很多地区春播和夏播蔬菜的工作已经完成，不少城市的春、夏菜播种面积都比去年扩大了很多。太原市的春、夏菜播种面积由去年的四万亩增加到今年的九万亩。正因为各地采取了种种切实有效的措施，不少地区今年的蔬菜供应状况，都比过去有了很大的改善，北京市去年4月份供应三千九百万斤，今年4月份增到七千万斤，增加近80％；太原市由去年5月初的每人每日七两增加到今年的十二两，也增加70％以上；广州市由去年每人每日半斤，今年增加到一斤，提高整整一倍。
    但是，我们不能在已经获得的成就面前停步不前，为了进一步改善人民生活，我们必须继续努力，争取更大的成绩。全国人民在工农业大跃进以后，购买力有了很大的增长，人民对蔬菜的需要量是大大增加了。很多城市由于工业的迅速发展，人口也日益增多，而且新的工矿区、新的城市也正在连续出现。从这一切情况看来，我们必须更加抓紧蔬菜生产，用更快的速度发展蔬菜生产，力求克服蔬菜生产中的不平衡现象，加强薄弱环节，首先是使大城市的蔬菜生产能更快地发展起来，进一步满足全国人民对蔬菜日益增长着的需要，满足广大城市和工矿区人民对蔬菜的需要。
    大中城市和工矿区蔬菜生产问题在当前整个蔬菜生产中占有特殊重要的地位。城市是我国的工业基地，我们在生产和生活中需要的一切工业品，绝大部分是由城市供应的。能不能保证广大职工及城市居民有足够的蔬菜供应，是和发展工业直接有关的一个大问题，是农业支援工业发展的一项十分重要的任务。城市特别是大城市蔬菜生产必须贯彻郊区为城市服务和执行就地生产就地供应的方针。这就是说，在保证城市蔬菜自给的方针下，近郊区的农业生产应该“以蔬菜为主”，粮、棉、菜等各种作物能够同时兼顾的，当然可以同时兼顾，如果不能同时兼顾，必须首先保证蔬菜生产的发展；棉、粮及其他作物与蔬菜生产不发生矛盾便罢，如果发生矛盾，那就应该首先为蔬菜让路。这是唯一正确的方针。只有坚决执行这条方针，才能使蔬菜生产得到必要的劳动力，才能给蔬菜生产分配必要的生产资料，从而做到城市蔬菜自给。哪一个地方对这个方针贯彻执行得好，哪一个地方的蔬菜供应就很充分。望各地切实注意这个经验。
    要迅速发展城市郊区的蔬菜生产，必须坚决贯彻党的方针，认真作好对郊区农民的思想教育工作，切实解决郊区农民在发展蔬菜生产中的具体问题。城市党委应该加强对菜农的工农联盟的教育，提高菜农的政治思想觉悟，使菜农认识到发展蔬菜生产，支援城市建设是郊区农民的光荣责任。同时要订出切实的办法保护菜农的正当利益，要用合理的价格收购菜农的蔬菜，要适当保证菜农的口粮供应。
    我们强调发展城市郊区的蔬菜生产，是不是农村的蔬菜就不重要了呢？不是的。农村人口占全国人口的绝大部分，解决五亿农民的吃菜问题当然是同样重要的。一切事物一切工作，总是互相联系、互相制约着的。农村蔬菜问题解决不好，城市的蔬菜仍然是解决不好的。过去个别地区曾经发生过的城市蔬菜“倒流”入乡村的现象，就是有力的说明。因此，必须采取城乡并重的方针，才能全面地解决蔬菜问题。在安排人民公社的蔬菜生产的时候，必须既抓商品性的蔬菜生产，又要抓自给性的蔬菜生产。必须把两方面的生产同时安排好，否则就会影响整个地区的蔬菜自给。
    蔬菜是关系全体人民生活的大问题，是一个严重的政治问题，各地党委必须发动广大农民，认真贯彻党的方针，使我国的蔬菜生产有一个更为巨大的发展。现在正是春、夏菜生长盛期，应该采取切实措施，保证春菜、夏菜生长得好。秋菜的播种季节不久也就要到来了，更要及早动手认真作好秋菜播种的准备工作，层层落实，坚决抓好秋菜生产。特别是没有完成春菜和夏菜播种计划的城市，一定要保证完成并且适当扩大秋菜的播种面积，以解决全年的蔬菜供应问题。
