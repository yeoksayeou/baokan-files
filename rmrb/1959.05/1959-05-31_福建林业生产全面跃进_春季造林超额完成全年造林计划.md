    Fujian Forestry Production Leaps Forward Comprehensively
    Spring Afforestation Exceeds Annual Afforestation Plan

    (Our dispatch) Fujian Province's timber felling, timber transport, afforestation and other forestry production are making an all-round leap forward. In the first five months of this year, more than 4.42 million cubic meters of various types of trees were felled in the mountains, exceeding the annual timber felling task by nearly 500,000 cubic meters. More than 1.82 million cubic meters of timber have been transported to various water and land transportation lines, accounting for 46.7% of the annual plan. The province completed afforestation of 10 million mu in the spring, exceeding the annual afforestation plan.

    The main reasons for the comprehensive leap forward in forestry production in Fujian Province are: implementing the policy of unified leadership and decentralized management, with the state, communes, and production teams all engaging in forestry; vigorously developing forest farms and logging yards; and organizing professional teams to carry out year-round production. Now, the province has more than 210 state-owned logging yards and more than 500 commune-run and team-run logging yards (teams), with a total of more than 100,000 forestry production troops. Under the unified leadership of the local Party committees and communes, they have adopted a combination of professional teams and the vast number of farmers in forest areas to engage in afforestation, logging and other activities. In accordance with the national forestry production plan and the overall production arrangements of the communes, they have combined agriculture with logging, timber transport, afforestation and other production, as well as short-term shock campaigns and regular production, thereby greatly improving labor efficiency and work quality.

    At present, the rainy season has arrived in Fujian, and the water levels of rivers and streams have begun to rise, marking the start of a good season for timber transport. From the Wuyi Mountains in northern Fujian to the Daiyun Mountains in southern Fujian, along the banks of rivers, along highways and railways..., there are piles of timber waiting to be transported everywhere. Batches of timber rafts float down the major rivers, and trains and trucks loaded with timber speed day and night on the railways and highways. To date, as many as 540,000 cubic meters of mine props, sleepers and other construction materials have been transported to more than ten provinces and cities such as Shanghai, Jiangsu, Shandong, Anhui, Henan, and Shaanxi.

    Now, the forestry army is advancing victoriously, launching a new upsurge in forestry production centered on "rushing to transport timber to support industrial and agricultural production and construction". The vast number of forest farmers in Jian'ou, Nanping and other advanced areas in spring forestry production have proposed to ensure the quality, quantity and variety of timber, and to guarantee the logging, collection, and transportation to be completed four months ahead of schedule. They have launched a red flag competition for timber production to all forest areas in the province. This competition has been warmly responded to by various places, promoting the acceleration of timber collection, transportation and allocation. (Liu Kuihua)

    福建林业生产全面跃进
    春季造林超额完成全年造林计划
    本报讯　福建省伐木、运木、造林等林业生产全面跃进。今年头五个月中，伐倒在山场的各种林木即达四百四十二万多立方公尺，超额近五十万立方公尺完成了全年木材砍伐任务。运抵各水陆交通沿线的木材已达一百八十二万多立方公尺，占全年计划的46.7％。全省春季造林一千万亩，超额完成了全年的造林计划。
    福建省林业生产能够全面跃进的主要原因是：贯彻了统一领导、分级管理，国家和公社、生产队都办林业的方针，大搞林场、伐木场，组织专业队伍进行常年生产。现在全省有二百一十多个国营伐木场、五百多个社办和队办伐木场（队），共有十多万林业生产大军，他们在当地党委和公社统一领导下，采取专业队伍和林区广大农民造林、伐木等运动相结合，按照国家林业生产计划和公社整个生产安排，把农业和伐木、运木、造林等生产，以及短期突击和经常性生产结合起来，因而大大提高了劳动效率和工作质量。
      目前，福建雨季已到，江河溪流水位开始升涨，运木的好季节开始了。从闽北武夷山到闽南戴云山的广大林区里，从各江河沿岸、各公路、铁路沿线……，到处是堆积如山的待运木材。一批批木排沿各主要江河流放而下，各铁路和公路线上，满载木材的火车和汽车昼夜飞奔。到目前止，单是运往上海、江苏、山东、安徽、河南、陕西等十多个省市的矿柱、枕木和其他建设用材达五十四万立方公尺之多。
    现在各地林业大军正乘胜前进，以“抢运木材，支援工农业生产建设”为中心，掀起了林业生产新高潮。春季林业生产先进地区建瓯、南平等县广大林农们，提出保质保量保品种和包伐、包集运提前四个月超额、全面完成今年木材生产任务为条件，向全省各林区发起木材生产红旗竞赛。这个竞赛得到了各地热烈响应，促进了各地木材集运调拨工作加快进行。　（刘葵华）
