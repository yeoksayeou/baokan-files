Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, May 30th: The Vietnam News Agency reported today that the Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, on May 30th, sent a letter to the countries participating in the 1954 Geneva Conference on Indochina. The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, in the letter, exposed the grave actions of the Laotian Kingdom's Phoui Sananikone government in violating the Geneva Agreements on Laos. It also requested the participating countries of the Geneva Conference to take measures to stop the development of the current situation in Laos, which is detrimental to peace.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, May 30th: According to local newspapers today, the Liaison Delegation of the General Command of the Vietnam People's Army wrote to the International Commission in Vietnam on the 23rd, demanding that it stop the illegal relationship between the South Vietnamese authorities and the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization aggressive bloc.

The letter stated that, according to reports from South Vietnam, the South Vietnamese authorities had sent representatives and aircraft to participate in a large-scale air force exercise held by the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization aggressive bloc countries, led by the United States, at Clark Air Base in the Philippines on April 28th.

The letter said that the participation of the South Vietnamese authorities in this air force exercise and other exercises organized by the Southeast Asia military bloc since the beginning of this year, proves that the South Vietnamese authorities are strengthening their ties with this military bloc, and implementing the military plans of this military bloc, especially the United States.

The Liaison Delegation of the Vietnam People's Army pointed out that this event proves that a true military alliance is forming between the South Vietnamese authorities and the Southeast Asia military bloc, led by the United States. The delegation requested the International Commission in Vietnam to draw conclusions regarding the above-mentioned violations of the Geneva Agreements, and to make the South Vietnamese authorities sever their illegal relations with the Southeast Asia military bloc, especially with the United States.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, May 30th: A telegram from the Demilitarized Zone on the 29th reported that in the early morning of the 28th, more than 250 military and administrative personnel of the South Vietnamese authorities, without carrying legal permits issued by the local Joint Commission, broke into the southern part of the Demilitarized Zone.

These South Vietnamese military and administrative personnel traveled in more than 40 cars and a large number of motorcycles and bicycles, arriving near the Hien Luong Bridge, proceeding along the Ben Hai River, the demarcation line, and congregating at the Vu Xa village near the bridge.

On the 27th, a car carrying eleven South Vietnamese military officers and administrative personnel also came near the bridge to conduct surveying towards the North.

The liaison officer of the Vietnam People's Army participating in the Joint Commission immediately notified the Joint Commission's team of these incursions. The Vietnam People's Army side has already issued two protest letters to the team, demanding that the South Vietnamese authorities immediately cease this behavior that violates the Geneva Agreements.
