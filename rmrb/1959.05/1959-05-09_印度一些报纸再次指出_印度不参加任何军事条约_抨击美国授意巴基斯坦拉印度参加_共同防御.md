Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, May 8th: Some Indian newspapers are criticizing the United States for instigating Pakistan to lure India into so-called "joint defense" activities.

The Indian Urdu newspaper "The Daily Tej" published an editorial today exposing the background of Pakistani President Ayub Khan's suggestion to establish an India-Pakistan "joint defense." The editorial stated, "As soon as we heard the suggestion made by the President of Pakistan, we immediately felt that someone was pulling the strings behind the scenes. The United States controls Pakistan's foreign relations, and it is no secret that Pakistani leaders or politicians never speak out without the authorization of the United States."

The newspaper continued, "It is hard to believe that President Ayub Khan would talk about joint defense without the authorization of the Americans. It must be the Americans pulling the strings, and so the President of Pakistan spoke out. Former U.S. Ambassador to India, Bowles' recent remarks about the relationship between India and Pakistan should help dispel any doubts in this regard."

The editorial criticized Bowles' suggestion that the Tibetan incident should be used to bring about a reconciliation between India and Pakistan. It said, "Before this discussion continues, two things should be acknowledged: First, India will not abandon its non-aligned policy, and it will not participate in any military treaty. Second, India, like Pakistan, hopes for a peaceful resolution of the differences between the two countries."

The newspaper also said, "Pakistan is talking about border issues and China's actions in Tibet, meaning that India, facing threats from the Chinese side, should now resolve the Kashmir and canal water disputes. Therefore, Pakistan suggests cooperation so that India can take steps to develop a joint defense."

The newspaper said, "In our opinion, it is unlikely that India and Pakistan will hold high-level meetings seeking mutual cooperation."

The "National Herald" published an editorial on the 7th regarding the meeting held in Washington to discuss the relationship between India and the United States, stating, "The United States must view India according to India's actual situation, and should not expect its [India's] policies to change due to the developments in Tibet and the emergence of tension in Sino-Indian relations."

The newspaper accused, "The practice of American policymakers linking economic issues with Cold War issues has already damaged the relationship between India and the United States."

The "Times of India" said on the 8th, commenting on U.S. Secretary of Defense McElroy's testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, "McElroy admitted in many words that Pakistan possesses more troops than the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff believe it needs to defend against communism. Does the U.S. government understand what this means to India? This can only make India more worried and more concerned about the military aid the United States gives to Pakistan. After the U.S. Secretary of Defense revealed these circumstances, few people in India can accept the so-called guarantee that this aid will not be used against India at its face value.

The newspaper said that this aid "may indeed encourage Pakistan to pursue a policy of military adventurism."

Today's "Hindustan Standard" published a short commentary saying, "India is certainly uneasy about the extent of military aid Pakistan receives from the United States." It accused, "The guarantee offered by McElroy that Pakistan's military efforts are aimed at communist aggression has lost its strength."

### 印度一些报纸再次指出  印度不参加任何军事条约  抨击美国授意巴基斯坦拉印度参加“共同防御”

    印度一些报纸再次指出
    印度不参加任何军事条约
    抨击美国授意巴基斯坦拉印度参加“共同防御”
    新华社新德里8日电　印度的一些报纸抨击美国唆使巴基斯坦拉拢印度参加所谓“共同防御”的活动。
    印度乌尔都文报纸“文汇报”今天发表社论，揭露巴基斯坦总统阿尤布汗建议建立印度—巴基斯坦“共同防御”的背景。社论说，“当我们一听到巴基斯坦总统所提出的建议，我们立刻就感到有人在上面拉线。美国控制着巴基斯坦的外交关系，没有美国方面的授意，巴基斯坦的领导人或者政治家是从来不开腔的，这不是什么秘密。”
    这家报纸接着说，“没有美国人的授意，阿尤布汗总统就谈论共同防御，这是很难令人相信的。必定是美国人在拉线，于是巴基斯坦总统就开腔了。前美国驻印度大使鲍尔斯最近关于印度同巴基斯坦之间关系的谈话应当有助于消除这方面的任何怀疑”。
    社论抨击鲍尔斯提出的应当利用西藏事件来使印度和巴基斯坦取得和解的这种建议。它说，“在这种讨论继续下去之前，应当承认两件事：第一，印度将不放弃它的不结盟政策，它将不参加任何军事条约。第二，印度像巴基斯坦一样，希望和平解决两国之间的分歧。”
    报纸还说，“巴基斯坦谈论边界问题和中国在西藏的行动，意思是说，面临着中国方面威胁的印度现在应当解决克什米尔和运河用水争端，因此巴基斯坦建议合作，以便印度采取步骤来发展共同防御。”
    这家报纸说，“在我们看来，印度和巴基斯坦举行谋求相互合作的最高级会议是不大可能的。”
    “国民先驱报”在7日就在华盛顿举行的关于讨论印度和美国之间的关系的会议发表社论说，“美国必须按照印度的实际情况来看待印度，而不要期望它（指印度）的政策会由于西藏的事态发展以及中印关系出现了紧张状态而发生任何改变。”
    这家报纸指责说，“美国的决策者把经济问题和冷战问题扯在一起的做法已经把印度和美国的关系弄糟了。”
    “印度时报”8日在评论美国国防部长麦克耳罗伊在参议院外交委员会的作证时说，“麦克耳罗伊在许多话中承认，巴基斯坦拥有的部队超过了美国参谋长联席会议认为它防御共产主义所需要的部队。美国政府是否了解这对印度来说意味着什么？这只能使印度对美国给巴基斯坦的军事援助更为忧虑和更为担心。美国国防部长透露了这些情况后，在印度很少有人能够按它的表面价值来接受所谓这种援助不会用来反对印度的保证。
    这家报纸说，这种援助“也许的确会鼓励巴基斯坦奉行军事冒险的政策。”
    今天的“印度斯坦旗报”发表短评说，“印度对巴基斯坦从美国那里获得的军事援助的程度当然感到不安。”它指责说，“麦克耳罗伊提出的关于巴基斯坦在军事方面的努力是针对共产党侵略的这种保证失去了力量。”
