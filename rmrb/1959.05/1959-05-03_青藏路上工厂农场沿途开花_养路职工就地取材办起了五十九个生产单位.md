Xinhua News Agency, Xining, 2nd. The workers on the Qinghai-Tibet Highway, on the premise of building and maintaining the highway and ensuring smooth transportation, have established fifty-nine factories, mines, farms, forest farms, and pastures along the two-thousand-kilometer highway over the past few years. When the Tibetan rebels launched their rebellion, the workers at the fourteen maintenance stations along the line expressed great indignation. They were determined to support the People's Liberation Army in thoroughly quelling the rebellion with practical actions to ensure the smooth passage of the entire line.

The area through which this highway passes is generally three to five thousand meters above sea level, and most of it is uninhabited valleys, grasslands, and Gobi deserts. Now these factories and mining enterprises are blooming along the road, and the desolate appearance is gradually changing. The eight auto repair and maintenance plants along the line enable the repair, maintenance, and parts manufacturing of automobiles to be solved locally; two iron mines are smelting pig iron and steel for casting tools and accessories. Six coal mines have also been opened, producing a total of 50,000 tons of coal last year. The workers have cultivated farms and vegetable gardens on the wastelands along the road, growing highland barley, wheat and other food crops, and dozens of vegetables. This year, the "Kunlun" named farm in the Golmud area will produce 5.8 million catties of vegetables. On the Kunlun Mountains, known as the "Mountain of Treasures," the workers "work non-stop despite strong winds and heavy snow, and climb snow-capped peaks to find treasures on Sundays," combining road construction and maintenance with treasure hunting and mining. They have now mined abundant resources such as coal, iron, and borax, cement, refractory materials, and building materials. Areas that were previously uninhabited for thousands of miles now have a small market town every hundred kilometers on average, and a residential point every ten kilometers.

The factories and mining enterprises established by the workers have two characteristics. First, they did not require the state to provide funds, but started from scratch using local materials and gradually expanded. Second, they comprehensively develop and engage in diversified operations based on needs and possibilities. Most of the products are tools and equipment for highway and transportation services, as well as daily necessities for workers. Most of these factories and mining enterprises are named after "Kunlun," and the products are all trademarked with "Jade Void Peak" (the main peak of the Kunlun Mountains), symbolizing their ambition to develop and build the remote areas of the motherland, as unshakable as the Kunlun Mountains.

In addition to some larger enterprises directly operated by the Highway Administration, the fourteen highway maintenance sections along the line also undertake the task of developing each section while maintaining the highway. All dining and lodging stations, gas stations, and road maintenance teams every ten kilometers have also built houses, raised sheep, and grown vegetables, striving for self-sufficiency. The workers' families have all been organized to participate in production, solving the difficulty of insufficient labor. (Attached picture)

### 青藏路上工厂农场沿途开花  养路职工就地取材办起了五十九个生产单位

    青藏路上工厂农场沿途开花
    养路职工就地取材办起了五十九个生产单位
    本报西宁2日电　青藏公路的职工，在修好和养好公路、保证交通运输畅通的前提下，几年来，在两千多公里长的公路线上办起了五十九个工厂、矿场、农场、林场和牧场。当西藏叛匪发动叛乱时，沿线十四个养护站的职工，表示极大愤怒。他们决心以保证全线畅通的实际行动，支援人民解放军彻底平定叛乱。
    这条公路经过地区一般在拔海三千到五千公尺，绝大部分是荒无人烟的山谷、草原和戈壁滩。现在这些厂矿企业沿路开花，荒凉的面貌正在逐渐改变。沿线的八个汽车修配厂和保养厂，使汽车的修理保养和零件制配能够就地解决；两个铁矿场，正在为铸造工具配件冶炼生铁和钢材。还开采了六个煤矿，去年共采煤五万吨。职工们在沿路的荒滩上垦植了农场和菜园，种出了青稞、小麦等粮食作物和几十种蔬菜。今年，噶尔穆地区以“昆仑”命名的农场将生产蔬菜五百八十万斤。职工们在被称为“万宝山”的昆仑山上，“大风大雪不停工，星期找宝爬雪峰”，结合着修路养路找宝开矿，现在已经开采了煤、铁和硼砂，水泥、耐火材料、建筑材料等丰富的资源。以前千里无人的地区，现在平均一百公里，就有一个小集镇，十公里就有一个居民点。
    职工们办起的厂矿企业有两个特点。一是没有要国家出钱，而是就地取材，白手起家，逐渐扩建的。二是综合开发，看需要和可能大搞多种经营。产品大多为公路和运输服务的工具器材，以及职工的生活用品。这些厂矿企业大多数以昆仑“命名”，产品都以“玉虚峰”（昆仑山主峰）为商标，象征着他们开发和建设祖国边远地区的雄心壮志，像昆仑山一样不可动摇。
    除了公路管理局直接经营的一些较大的企业外，全线十四个公路养护段也在养好公路的同时承担着开发各段的任务。各个食宿站、加油站和每隔十公里一个的养路班，也都修盖房屋，养羊种菜，力求自给。职工家属都被组织起来参加了生产，解决了劳动力不足的困难。（附图片）
