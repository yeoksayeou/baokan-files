Continue to Actively Carry out Mass Hydrological Observation and Research Work
Speech by Delegate Jia Lian

Fellow Delegates:

I fully agree with and warmly endorse the reports made by Premier Zhou Enlai, Vice Premier Li Fuchun, Vice Premier Li Xiannian, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen. I am a hydrological worker, please allow me to give a brief report to the Congress on the situation of hydrological work in our country.

Hydrological work developed rapidly in 1958, and the national hydrological station network has been basically completed

Hydrological work studies the changing patterns of water in rivers and lakes to serve water conservancy construction and various aspects of the national economy. If meteorology explores the secrets of "heavenly palace" and makes weather forecasts to serve production and construction, then hydrological work should explore the secrets of "dragon palace," explore hydrological patterns, and serve production and construction. All aspects related to rivers and lakes, such as water conservancy and hydropower projects, urban construction, factories, mines, docks, warehouses, highways, railways, shipping, fisheries, and national defense construction, need to use hydrological data and hydrological forecasts. In particular, the construction of water conservancy and hydropower projects, which constantly deals with water, especially requires hydrological data. Therefore, hydrological work is a basic task necessary for the development of national economic construction.

During the First Five-Year Plan period, especially in the Great Leap Forward of 1958, with the rapid development of all aspects of the national economy, hydrological work, like other tasks, under the correct leadership of party committees and governments at all levels, and on the basis of the victory of the rectification campaign against the rightists, also experienced a leap forward and achieved great results. I do not intend to give a detailed report here on the achievements of hydrological work in all aspects. Now I will only report to the Congress on the great development of hydrological stations and how to implement the mass line in hydrological work.

Under the shining light of the socialist general line, hydrological workers in various places in 1958 exerted their energy and, under the guidance of the policy of running hydrology diligently and thriftily, tapped potential, improved labor productivity, greatly developed hydrological survey stations, and expanded the service area. As I said before, hydrological work is a basic task of national economic construction and also a service industry. We know that the commercial sector provides services through a commercial network composed of many department stores and retail stores. Similarly, our hydrological work provides services through a hydrological station network composed of many hydrological survey stations. In 1958, the number of hydrological stations in our country greatly increased. More than 2,300 stations were added nationwide, of which the most important flow stations increased by 770, more than six times the increase in flow stations in 1957, equivalent to 82.4 percent of the total number of stations added during the First Five-Year Plan. By the end of 1958, there were 9,700 national survey stations of various levels across the country. Except for a few stations not set up in extremely remote areas, a close-knit national basic hydrological station network has been basically completed, completing the task stipulated in Article 22 of the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft) ahead of schedule.

Last year, mass hydrological research work was vigorously carried out, and more than 40,000 mass hydrological stations have been built, which not only collected rich hydrological observation data, but also directly served current production, and the masses are very satisfied.

The party's socialist general line not only promoted the rapid development of hydrological station networks, but also illuminated the direction of hydrological work development. After a greater upsurge in the mass water conservancy construction movement in the winter of 1957, water conservancy construction projects blossomed everywhere, and thousands of reservoirs and soil and water conservation projects were rapidly built. At this time, hydrological work, as the vanguard of water conservancy construction, obviously felt that it could not keep up with the needs of the objective situation, because our past hydrological survey stations were mostly located on large and medium-sized rivers, and our hydrological calculations and hydrological forecasts were also limited to large and medium-sized rivers, and we had no time to take care of medium and small rivers, because there were so many medium and small rivers, and all hydrological work could not be contracted by the state. Therefore, in the case of mass water conservancy construction, there was a lack of hydrological data everywhere. Many mass water conservancy projects were built without hydrological calculations. We know that building projects without hydrological calculations is like tailoring clothes without measuring the size. Either the clothes are made too small or too big. Reservoirs or sluice gates and dams are built in rivers to block and store water. If we don’t calculate how much water is in the river and how big the flood is, then the reservoirs will be built too large or too small. This is either a waste of labor or not safe enough. At the same time, in order to manage and use the thousands of water conservancy projects that have been built well, it is also urgently required that hydrological work keep up, so that these projects can play their due role. Under this new situation, we examined the shortcomings of only paying attention to "large" and "foreign" while ignoring "small" and "local," and realized that to do a good job in hydrological service and ensure the smooth progress of mass water conservancy projects, we must break the mysterious view of hydrological work, resolutely take the mass line, hand over technology to the masses, and widely mobilize the masses to engage in hydrological work. The facts of the Great Leap Forward last year proved that once the masses are mobilized, their power is very great. According to incomplete statistics at the end of 1958, more than 40,000 mass hydrological stations were built across the country, which is more than four times the total number of national station networks. These mass stations not only carried out hydrological observation and data collection work, but also served local current production. For example, in terms of water accounting, last year the comrades of the national station network hydrological work were responsible for compiling easy-to-understand water accounting work manuals and distributing them to counties and communes, and helping county and commune water conservancy cadres to study. In this way, county and commune cadres can carry out water conservancy planning and design for the whole county and commune, which has played a great role in the planning and arrangement of water conservancy projects and the construction of reservoirs. Hydrological information and forecasting have also been widely carried out. For example, the Mengcheng Special Zone of Anhui Province mobilized the masses to carry out hydrological forecasting, which has played a significant role in flood prevention work on the surface and water distribution, irrigation plan water use, and other aspects in the dry season. Not only that, after the broad masses of people engaged in hydrological observation and research, the hydrological observation results can directly serve the current agricultural production. Recently, I went to several provinces in the south to inspect work, visited many hydrological stations run by the masses, and visited the party and government responsible comrades of the counties and communes. They all attached great importance to this work and also introduced many practical examples in this regard: For example, in the autumn of 1958, some wheat fields in Shihe People's Commune, Bo County, Anhui Province, did not dare to sow because of drought. When the peasant observers of the mass hydrological station measured that the soil moisture content was above 18 percent, it proved that it was suitable for sowing. After the production team's research, they immediately organized the sowing of wheat fields. After five days, the wheat seedlings came out. The captain said: "You are really good, really good consultants for farmers." After they calculated the available water volume of the whole team, they decided to expand the area of rice conversion by 1,300 mu, and the grain yield increased by 300 jin per mu. The masses praised: "The hydrological station is capable. It manages astronomy and geography. With Chairman Mao, everyone in the station is better than immortals. The Dragon Kings of the four seas all give way." Another example is the Lishao People's Commune in Luoding County, Guangdong Province, which is located in a semi-mountainous area. Soil erosion and drought are relatively serious. In the past, they relied on the sky for food. In recent years, they have built 250 mountain ponds, reservoirs, and medium-sized reservoirs. Since the establishment of a hydrological and meteorological station last year, after mastering the hydrological and meteorological conditions of the whole commune, they can carry out meteorological forecasts and hydrological forecasts, and use radio, blackboard newspapers, signal flags, telephones, and other methods to release water information in a timely manner. In February this year, there were two rainfalls. The commune party committee promptly mobilized more than 15,000 people to work on water storage and water conservation. According to the changes in water level, they adjusted the position of the waterwheel and automatically lifted water for irrigation, ensuring that most of the commune's paddy fields, about 30,000 mu, transplanted rice 10 to 15 days earlier than last year, creating conditions for a good harvest. When I visited the commune, Secretary Li Zhiqiang said to me: "Hydrological and meteorological work really plays the role of the party committee's consultant. We must firmly grasp this link." Another example is the Baimao People's Commune in Changshu County, Jiangsu Province. When water conservancy projects were built in 1958, the transportation of materials was difficult due to shallow water. The comrades leading the project were very anxious. Lu Yongsheng, a farmer observer at the mass hydrological station, predicted that the river water would rise according to the weather forecast that there would be easterly winds. He also mastered the changing pattern of the Yangtze River tide, so he made a prediction of the river water rise height and the time of appearance, and notified the material transport ships that they could deliver on time, which really achieved the goal. Another night, according to the changes in wind, rain, and tide, he predicted that the river water would rise a lot, and reported to the party committee overnight. The party committee immediately convened a telephone conference to mobilize the masses to block the gaps in the sluice gates and dams of the whole commune. The river water suddenly rose by more than half a meter that night. Thanks to the prior precautions, all the farmland was spared the danger of being flooded, which played a significant role. In addition to general stations, the masses also set up research stations to study the hydrological changes of small rivers. This was originally a highly technical matter, but the masses also did a good job with local methods and achieved certain results. The runoff of the Gantang River in Yiyang County, Henan Province, is an example. The station found out the reasons for soil erosion in the upper reaches, proposed methods to prevent soil erosion and surface erosion, and applied the measured data to the two medium-sized reservoirs built on the Gantang River. They also carried out hydrological and meteorological forecasts, which were done very well. Therefore, the local people said with satisfaction: "It's wonderful to build this station. We know when it rains and the water rises. People and property are well protected. Thanks to the good leadership of the party."

Through the mass mobilization to run mass hydrological observation and research work in 1958, I deeply realized the correctness of the general policy of "five parallel" and "walking on two legs" formulated by the central government. It is like a lighthouse, illuminating the direction of our hydrological work. Our hydrological workers must carry out work with "two legs." We must actively carry out mass hydrological observation and research work, so that national station networks and mass stations are carried out simultaneously, and gradually achieve that every commune runs hydrology and every station provides service.

Of course, because mobilizing the masses to run hydrology is still a new task, our experience is still very lacking. From the national situation, there are still some problems at present. For example, in some areas, mass station networks have been established, but they cannot be consolidated, and the role they play in local current production is still not enough. In some areas, mass stations have not been established. In some areas, mass hydrological stations do not cooperate very closely with relevant units such as civil meteorological outposts, agricultural irrigation experiment stations, or scientific research. These must be continuously improved in future work, so as to do hydrological work more, faster, better, and more economically.

If there is anything inappropriate in the above speech, please criticize and correct it.

    继续积极开展群众性水文观测研究工作
    贾琏代表的发言各位代表：
    我完全同意并热烈拥护周恩来总理、李富春副总理、李先念副总理和彭真副委员长的各项报告。我是一个水文工作者，请允许我就我国水文工作情况向大会作一个简要汇报。
    一九五八年，水文工作发展迅速，全国水文站网已基本建成
    水文工作是研究江河湖泊水的变化规律，来为水利建设及国民经济各方面服务的，如果说，气象工作是探知“天宫”的秘密，作出天气预报，为生产建设服务，那么水文工作就应探知“龙宫”的秘密，探求水文规律，为生产建设服务。凡是与江河湖泊有关的水利电力工程，城建、工厂、矿山、码头、仓库、公路、铁路、航运、渔业及国防建设等各方面，都要应用水文资料与水文预报，尤其水利电力工程的建设，时刻与水打交道，也就特别需要水文资料。所以水文工作是国民经济建设发展所必需的一项基本工作。
    在第一个五年计划期间，尤其在一九五八年的大跃进中，随着国民经济各方面的迅速发展，水文事业和其他工作一样，在各级党政的正确领导下，在整风反右的胜利基础上，也有着飞跃的发展，取得了巨大的成绩。我不打算在这里将水文工作的各方面的成就作详细的汇报，现在只从水文站的大发展，以及在水文工作中如何贯彻群众路线等方面向大会汇报一下。
    在社会主义总路线的光辉照耀下，一九五八年各地水文工作者鼓足了干劲，在勤俭办水文的方针指导下，挖掘了潜力，提高了劳动生产率，大大发展了水文测站，扩大了服务面。前面说过水文工作是国民经济建设的一项基本工作，也是一门服务行业，我们知道，商业部门搞服务是通过许多百货公司、零售商店所组成的商业网来服务的，同样，我们水文工作搞服务就要通过许多水文测站组成的水文站网来服务，一九五八年我国水文站网数量有着很大的发展，全国共增设二千三百余处，其中最为主要的流量站就增加了七百七十处，比一九五七年增加的流量站多六倍多，相当于第一个五年计划所增加的总站数的百分之八十二点四。到一九五八年底全国共有各级国家测站九千七百处，除极荒僻地区尚有少数测站未设外，已经基本上建成了一个严密的国家基本水文站网，提前完成了农业发展纲要（修正草案）第二十二条所规定的任务。
    去年，大搞群众性的水文研究工作，已建成群众性水文站四万余处，不但收集了丰富的水文观测资料，而且直接为当前的生产服务，群众非常满意
    党的社会主义总路线，不但促进了水文站网的迅速发展，并且照亮了水文工作发展的方向。一九五七年冬，在群众性水利建设运动掀起更大的高潮以后，水利建设工作遍地开花，成千上万的水库及水土保持工程迅速修建起来。这时，作为水利建设的尖兵的水文工作显然感到赶不上客观形势的需要，因为我们过去的水文测站大都布设在大、中河流上，我们所进行的水文计算和水文预报等服务工作也都局限于大、中河流上，而对中、小河流无暇顾及，因为中、小河流数量众多，所有水文工作也不可能由国家包下来，所以在大搞群众性的水利建设情况下，到处感到水文资料缺乏，有许多群众性水利工程，没有经过水文计算就修建起来。我们知道，没有进行水文计算就修工程，好像裁衣服没有量尺寸一样，不是把衣服做小了就是会做得太大。水库或闸、坝修在河里边，用来拦水与蓄水的，不先算算河里有多少水量，有多大洪水，那么水库就会修得偏大或偏小，这样不是浪费了劳力就是修得不够安全。同时为了把已建成的千千万万的水利工程管理运用好，也迫切要求水文工作跟上去，使这些工程发挥应有的作用。在这种新的形势下，我们检查了过去只注意“大”、“洋”而忽视“小”、“土”的缺点，认识到要做好水文服务工作，保证群众性水利工程的顺利进行，必须打破水文工作的神秘观点，坚决走群众路线，把技术交给群众，并广泛发动群众来搞水文工作。去年大跃进的事实证明，一旦群众发动起来以后，其力量是非常巨大的，据一九五八年底的不完全统计，全国共建成了群众水文站四万余处，约为国家站网总数的四倍多。这些群众站不但进行了水文观测收集资料的工作，而且也为当地当前生产服务，比如在算水账方面，去年国家站网的水文工作同志负责编写通俗易懂的算水账的工作手册发给县、社，并帮助县、社的水利干部进行学习，这样县、社干部就能进行全县、全社的水利化规划设计，对水利工程的计划安排及水库的修建都起了很大的作用。在水文情报和预报方面，也普遍开展起来了，比如安徽省蒙城专区发动群众进行水文预报，对面上的防汛工作及枯水水量分配、灌溉计划用水等各方面都起到显著的效果。不仅如此，在广大群众进行水文观测研究以后还能使水文观测结果直接为当前的农业生产服务，最近我曾到南方几个省检查工作，看了许多群众办的水文站，访问了县、社的党政负责同志，他们对这项工作都非常重视，也介绍了不少这方面的实际例子：如安徽亳县十河人民公社一九五八年秋有的麦田因地旱不敢播种，当群众水文站的农民观测员测得墒情（地里土壤所含水分的情况）均在百分之十八以上时，证明还宜于播种，经过生产队的研究，立即组织了麦田的下种工作，经过五天的时间，麦苗就出齐了，队长说：“你们真行，真是庄稼人的好参谋。”当他们算清全队的可用水量后，决定扩大稻改面积一千三百亩，每亩增产了粮食三百斤，群众赞扬说：“水文站，有能耐，天文地理都来管，有了毛主席，站上个个赛神仙，四海龙王都让位。”又如广东省罗定县位于半山区的黎少人民公社，水土流失和旱情比较严重，过去靠天吃饭，近几年来修了二百五十座山塘水库和中型水库，自从去年建立了水文气象站，掌握了全社的水文气象情况后，能够进行气象预报和水文预报，并且用广播、黑板报、信号旗、电话等方式及时发布水情，在今年二月间两次降雨，公社党委及时动员一万五千多人作蓄水保水工作，根据水位变化调整水力水车的位置，自动提水灌溉，保证了公社中大部分水田约三万多亩比去年提前十至十五天插秧，为丰收创造了条件。我到公社参观时，李志强书记对我说：“水文气象工作真正起到了党委的参谋作用，我们一定紧紧抓住这一环。”再如江苏常熟县白茆人民公社在一九五八年兴修水利工程时，因水浅运料发生困难，领导这个工程的同志非常焦急，群众水文站农民观测员陆永生同志，根据当时的天气预报要刮东风，河水就要上涨，他还掌握了长江潮水变化的规律，于是作出河里涨水高度和出现时间的预报，通知运料船只可以按时运送，果然达到了目的。另一个夜晚，他根据风、雨和潮水的变化，预报河水会上涨很多，连夜向党委报告，党委立即召开电话会议，动员群众堵塞全公社的闸坝缺口，一夜河水果然突涨半公尺多，由于事先有防备，全部农田免除了被淹的危险，起到了显著的效果。除了一般性的站外，群众还办了研究小河流水文变化的研究性质的测站，本来这是技术性较高的，但群众用土办法也很好地办了起来，并且取得了一定的成绩，河南省宜阳县甘棠河径流就是一例，该站找出了上游水土流失的原因，提出防止水土流失及地表侵蚀的办法，并且将实测资料应用到甘棠河修建的两座中型水库上去，他们还进行了水文气象的预报，做得很好，因而当地群众满意地说：“咱建这站真是妙，下雨涨水先知道，人畜财产保得好，感谢党的好领导。”
    通过一九五八年发动群众大办群众性的水文观测研究工作后，我深深地体会到中央制定的“五个并举”和用“两条腿走路”的总方针的正确性，它好比一座灯塔，照亮了我们水文工作前进的方向，我们水文工作者一定要用“两条腿”来进行工作，我们一定要积极开展群众性的水文观测研究工作，做到国家站网与群众站同时并举，并且逐步达到社社办水文，站站搞服务。
    当然，由于发动群众办水文还是一项新的工作，因而我们的经验还很缺乏。从全国情况来看，目前还存在一些问题，比如有的地区群众站网建立起来了，但不能巩固，对当地当前生产所起的作用还很不够，有的地区群众站还没有建立起来，有些地区的群众水文站与民办气象哨，农业灌溉试验站或科学研究等有关单位协作得还不十分密切，这些均须在今后的工作中不断地加以改进，以便把水文工作做得更多更快更好更省。
    以上发言，如有不当之处，请代表们加以批评指正。
