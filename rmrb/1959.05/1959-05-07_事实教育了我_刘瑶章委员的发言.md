Facts Educated Me
    Speech by Committee Member Liu Yaozhang

    I completely agree with and support the work report of the Standing Committee of the Second National Committee delivered by Vice Chairman Li Weihan and the government work report delivered by Premier Zhou Enlai. Because these two reports truthfully reflect the actual situation of the work, profoundly summarize the experiences in the work, and clearly indicate the direction of future work.

    I am a person who has made serious mistakes in political stance. Through ten months of study at the Socialist Academy, the recent participation in the inspection tour in Henan, and the preliminary reading of the reports by Vice Chairman Li and Premier Zhou, I have been particularly deeply moved. I further realize that the leadership of the Party and the socialist path are absolutely correct; without the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, without the soaring enthusiasm of the people and the hard work of cadres at all levels, none of the achievements of socialist revolution and socialist construction would be conceivable. Therefore, I must intensify my fundamental transformation in order to barely keep up with the objectively rapidly developing situation, and to serve socialism and communism as an ordinary worker.

    Due to the deeply ingrained reactionary ruling class stance, my series of reactionary words and deeds since liberation have been extremely serious. The great anti-Rightist struggle seriously and thoroughly criticized my reactionary words and deeds, so that I was fortunately rescued when I was on the verge of destruction in a cliff valley. After the anti-Rightist struggle, the Party and the people not only treated me with special leniency, but also gave me the opportunity to participate in the study of the Socialist Academy, which I eagerly hoped for in my heart but did not have the courage to ask for. I was overjoyed; in the study, the Party's patient education and multi-faceted care, the students' stern supervision and enthusiastic help, everywhere embodied the policy of "treating the illness to save the person" and "being kind to people," so that I began to gain a preliminary understanding of my sinful words and deeds. Retaining me as a member of the Third National Committee was something I never dreamed of. When I received the notification, I was so excited that I couldn't speak, but after calming down a little, I somehow seemed to have gained a courage. This courage helped me break through the ideological concerns of going out for inspection, and finally I participated in the Henan inspection team.

    Although I participated in the Henan inspection team for only a short period of twenty days, and only went to three or four cities and counties, I deeply felt that everyone I came into contact with, from cadres from the province to the county and commune, from workers and peasants to school teachers and students, from old familiar friends to completely unfamiliar old ladies and children, not only did not discriminate against me in the slightest (in fact, discrimination is also justifiable), but also gave me all kinds of warmth and care. What a great encouragement this is to me! I see more clearly that Henan, like all parts of the country, from cities to villages, from industry to agriculture, from culture, education, and health to collective welfare, "our cause is thriving in all aspects and is advancing rapidly." What a profound education this is for me!

    The imperialists always say that it is impossible for us to fundamentally solve the food problem of more than 600 million people. In particular, Henan was a province of continuous disasters before liberation. However, since liberation, its grain production has been increasing year by year. For example, the highest average yield per mu of grain in Dongsi Village, Yanshi County, before liberation was only over 200 jin. In 1952, it was only 453 jin. After agricultural cooperativization in 1956, it rose to 675 jin, and after the people's commune in 1958, it had reached 1,300 jin. The average grain consumption per person was no more than 200 to 220 jin before liberation. In 1958, after selling 590,000 jin to the state, each commune member could still be allocated 500 jin. Moreover, commune members all have savings. This year, the large areas of high-yielding wheat areas are connected one after another, black and green, and you can't see the edge at a glance. Now it can be said that a bumper harvest is in sight. As for "eating without money," it is not only in Henan, but people's communes in rural areas all over the country have already implemented it. Where can people struggling on the verge of starvation be found!

    The imperialists fundamentally do not believe in our socialist industrialization. But in fact, even Henan, whose industrial foundation is almost equal to zero, has seen light and heavy industrial bases being established one by one. The several large-scale machinery manufacturing plants we saw have all completed basic construction ahead of schedule, put into production ahead of schedule, independently designed new varieties, and set the task of quadrupling production this year. Their products not only solve domestic production equipment, but also supply some to foreign countries. They fully develop the spirit of communist cooperation, on the one hand, helping local areas and communes to establish many small factories, and on the other hand, these small factories turn around to serve the large factories. The direction of commune industrialization is now more clearly demonstrated. In a few months, a street commune in Zhengzhou City set up 155 factories; a suburban commune set up 331 factories, from food processing to agricultural machinery repair, from self-sufficient production to commodity production, everything. The communes in Luoyang City, when daily necessities were relatively tight, found their own ways to produce, and actually solved 60% of the city's needs. Can the imperialists not admit defeat in the face of facts in the scale and speed of such development?

    Imperialists have always portrayed Chinese people, especially Chinese peasants, as either stupid or dirty. But in Dengfeng County, a barren mountain area we saw, illiteracy among young and middle-aged people was basically eliminated last year, and primary and secondary education was popularized. Moreover, a high tide of learning philosophy and writing poetry by all people was set off, and many "native experts" in agricultural science and technology also emerged, making outstanding contributions in reforming tools, harnessing mountains and rivers, and forecasting the weather. More than 90% of the children in Jingshi Street Primary School in Luoyang City are children of workers and peasants. Children around the age of ten have set up a "June 1st Factory", manufacturing radios in large quantities, which sell well all over the country, shining brightly for the combination of education and labor production. As for the counties and cities that have basically eliminated the four pests, there are already 29 in the province, and Dengfeng County is one of them. The county has basically eliminated twelve serious diseases such as goiter, syphilis, kala-azar, and roundworms through nationwide physical examinations and treatments. It can be seen that it is not accidental that the peasants' enthusiasm for production labor is getting higher and higher.

    When the imperialists' conspiracy of subversion cannot succeed, they wholeheartedly hope that there will be problems with our social security and that people will not be united. But they did not expect that the days when bandits were rampant like in Henan in the past were long gone. Especially with the people's commune and the integration of government and commune, not only is it easier to supervise the labor of controlled elements by the commune and facilitate the dictatorship, but also civil and criminal cases, and even disputes over quarrels have been greatly reduced. The general masses, due to the improvement of ideological awareness, have also undergone profound changes in the relationship between people. Democratic unity among family members, closer harmony between neighbors, full cooperation between factories, institutions, schools, and groups, and integration with nearby residents, the commune has truly become a socialist big family. With the commune as such a "basic unit of social structure," isn't it natural for more than 600 million people to unite as one under the leadership of the Party, based on common interests and common ideals?

    After our communization, the imperialists and all reactionaries paid special attention to the two issues of family and labor in their rumors and slanders. On the family issue, we only broke a feudal remnant of the patriarchal system and liberated tens of millions of female laborers. In the people's communes in Zhengzhou and Luoyang, we saw that the women who participated in production labor not only had money in their pockets and were economically independent, but also their cultural and technical levels were also improved. In particular, there was a common language between couples, and their feelings were stronger and their unity was closer. The bad habit of women comparing clothes and comparing jewelry has been replaced by comparing labor and comparing progress. The children who entered the nursery school learned more lively, more polite, and more full of collective friendship. Kangfu Paradise in Daye Commune, Dengfeng County, has a complete set of welfare facilities from women's pregnancy to production, breastfeeding, and childcare. It can be said that it is considerate and meticulous. Some communes divide public canteens into three stoves and seven halls, which also embodies the spirit of large collectives and small freedoms. It is clear that we did not break up any families, we just transformed poor and sad families into happy and fulfilling families. Whether it is the old society or modern capitalist countries, will they have such families? However, it is precisely such families that the imperialists and all reactionaries curse! It is reported that some American workers are forced to commit suicide by their families due to unemployment and hunger; while the Chiang Kai-shek gang imprisons many young women in the "American Army Paradise" comfort women's camps, they are engaged in a "happy family movement," which is really ridiculous! On the issue of labor, we have essential differences from capitalist countries. We have long solved the unemployment problem left over from the old society. However, due to the great leap forward in all aspects of industry and agriculture, there is still a shortage of labor. Under such circumstances, it is understandable that the working people, who have already become masters of their own affairs and have mastered their own destiny, have boiling enthusiasm and soaring energy. For example, a commune in the suburbs of Zhengzhou City, the commune members put forward the challenging slogan of "no soldiers when the wind blows, no work when it rains." Last winter, 200,000 people in Dengfeng County went up the mountain to engage in water conservancy, and they were unwilling to go down the mountain during the Spring Festival. Is this something that can be achieved by forced orders? Moreover, we personally saw on a small reservoir construction site in Wencun, this county, an old lady carrying soil, running happily; two brides laughing and racing, and the sound of symphonic music could be heard from far away. Is this comparable to the labor of crying faces under bourgeois exploitation and oppression? However, we do not solve the problem of labor force by infinitely increasing labor intensity. In addition to liberating the labor force, especially the female labor force, we mainly rely on improving labor organization and innovating production tools and technology. We require to improve labor productivity, and at the same time require appropriate study, entertainment and rest. The fundamental problem is still that we always care for people as people, which is completely different from the imperialists and all reactionaries who treat people as cattle and horses.

    There are also two things that left a particularly deep impression on me because of their sharp contrast. One is that for the Yellow River, which has been harmful for thousands of years, the so-called experts in capitalist countries have always believed that it is an incurable disease, but the Sanmenxia Water Conservancy Hub Project is progressing rapidly under the selfless assistance of the Soviet Union at a speed exceeding the design, and it is estimated that it can be completed about two and a half years ahead of schedule. This is an unprecedented victory in conquering the Yellow River! The Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang broke the Huayuankou Yellow River embankment in 1938, flooding 64 counties in three provinces and drowning 890,000 people, but we completed the Dongfeng Canal project in the vicinity of Huayuankou in 100 days last year, irrigating the land of 18 counties and cities and supplying industrial water to Zhengzhou City, making the same Huayuankou have two completely different meanings before and after. Some famous historical sites such as Longmen, Shaolin Temple, and White Horse Temple were either burned down during the warlord melee in the past, or were stolen and destroyed under the collusion between domestic and foreign enemies. Now we have protected and renovated them, and the cultural relics data are also being sorted out and studied, but the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang still has to send more than 5,000 boxes of precious historical relics that were smuggled to Taiwan to the United States for "special exhibition." This is really like what Chairman Mao said, "Its (referring to imperialism and all reactionaries) nature cannot be changed!"

    I heard someone recite a poem written by a worker: "What kind of vine bears what kind of melon, what kind of tree blooms what kind of flower, what kind of era loves what kind of people, what kind of class speaks what kind of words." It is not surprising at all that we have no common likes and dislikes with the imperialists and all reactionaries, nor do we have a common language.

    Why are we able to achieve such brilliant achievements? Undoubtedly, it is mainly due to the leadership of the Party, the adaptation of production relations to productive forces, and the adaptation of the superstructure to the economic base, so our social system has exerted its superiority, the people's commune has shown its strong vitality, so the creativity and initiative of the people have been infinitely displayed. This is the law of social development. But the imperialists and all reactionaries are not happy that we are getting better day by day, and they insist on denying this law, and they insist on transferring this law to their will, which is fundamentally impossible. In fact, since it is impossible, they can only comfort themselves by cursing others. But their curses cannot shake our position in the slightest, but only play a certain negative teaching role for us. First of all, because of their curses, it proves that we are indeed doing the right thing, thus strengthening our confidence in socialist and communist construction; secondly, because their curses are getting more and more fierce, it proves that our cause is getting more and more prosperous, and our lives are getting higher and higher; finally, they stimulate us in this way from the opposite side, so that on the one hand, we become more vigilant, and on the other hand, we work harder and harder to move in the direction opposite to their wishes, and the speed is getting faster and faster.

    In our continuous and comprehensive great leap forward, are there any difficulties and shortcomings? When inspecting in Henan, the leading cadres who reported the work never concealed the current difficulties and shortcomings. But what is the nature of the difficulties and shortcomings, compared with the several inspections I made before the anti-Rightist struggle, my understanding is definitely very different. Before the anti-Rightist struggle, I always had a strong desire to find "shortcomings" every time I set out for inspection, and even presupposed what "shortcomings" there should be; during the inspection, I tried every means to find "shortcomings" or to find materials that could be associated with the presupposed "shortcomings"; once I found them, I took them as a unique miracle, and consciously exaggerated and uglified them, and without analyzing and studying with anyone, I publicized them widely, to make the other party embarrassed and happy. Just from this point, isn't my reactionary political stance already obvious? In the process of development of things, especially new things, contradictions and imbalances, that is, difficulties and shortcomings, are impossible to completely avoid. But what we face, compared with difficulties and favorable conditions, favorable conditions are the main thing; compared with achievements and shortcomings, achievements are the main thing; and difficulties and shortcomings are only individual and temporary phenomena. Facts have proved that under the leadership of the Party, liberating the mind, working hard, and drilling hard, any difficulties and shortcomings can be overcome, and the vast majority have been overcome. I examine the differences in motivation, attitude, and method between my previous and subsequent inspections, which on the one hand further made me realize that my becoming a rightist was not accidental, and on the other hand, I also felt that my ideological stance seemed to be beginning a preliminary transformation.

    Chairman Mao mentioned at the beginning of his speech on "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" that "the unity of the country and the unity of the people," I never paid attention to it in the past; after the anti-Rightist struggle, in the study, sometimes my thoughts touched on this issue, but it was not in-depth. Recently, going out for inspection, from the vastness of the motherland and the prosperity of the 600 million people, and looking back at the domestic political changes I have personally experienced in the past 60 years, I realized that: unity and solidarity are so precious! Chairman Mao pointed out that "this is the basic guarantee that our cause will surely win" is so wise! Premier Zhou specially pointed out at the end of the report that "all our achievements are created by the united strength of all patriotic people in our country," which contains such a lofty sense of pride! The achievement of this unity and solidarity is of course primarily due to the leadership of the Party. With the leadership of the Party, it is possible for more than 600 million people to reach a consensus on action from the consistency of ideological stance, and it is possible to struggle for a common cause and a common ideal goal based on a unified policy and line. But the bourgeois rightists (including myself) are precisely on this issue to take the reactionary road of resisting the historical trend and violating the wishes of more than 600 million people. To divide the country, to make more than 600 million people live in misery, and to allow American imperialism and the Chiang Kai-shek gang to make a comeback. What a dangerous road this is! Thinking of this, I have a more concrete and profound understanding of the seriousness of my reactionary words and deeds and the necessity of the anti-Rightist struggle than in the past.

    In this inspection, I came into contact with many working people, and I once experienced their thoughts and feelings very superficially from their work and life. I finally felt that it is not a simple and easy thing to transform from an exploiting class to a working class. Specifically, for me personally, in terms of listening to the Party, loving labor, and collectivist spirit, I am not generally inferior to the working people, but far behind. Therefore, at present, there can be no common thoughts and feelings, common language, and of course, there is even less talk of making a common contribution to the socialist cause. This will be a great driving force for my intensified transformation.

    Without the anti-Rightist struggle, my stubborn mind could not have been slightly sobered up. Without the study of the Socialist Academy, it would have been impossible to gradually improve my self-understanding. Without this trip to Henan for inspection, it would have been impossible to personally experience the loveliness of the Party, the loveliness of the motherland, and the loveliness of the 600 million people, and the hateful of imperialism and all reactionaries from many vivid and fresh things. For a bourgeois rightist, the Party's series of policies are completely correct. I sincerely thank the Party for its greatness and Chairman Mao for his wisdom. I admit that the transformation of a person's class stance and ideology must go through a long, repeated, and arduous struggle process, but under the call and education of the Party and Chairman Mao, under the supervision and help of the people, and under the encouragement of the favorable situation at home and abroad, I believe and guarantee that I will be able to make full efforts and earnestly transform in the future in study, in labor, and in work practice, in order to contribute everything to the unprecedentedly great cause of socialist communism.

　　事实教育了我
    刘瑶章委员的发言
    我完全同意并且拥护李维汉副主席的第二届全国委员会常务委员会工作报告和周恩来总理的政府工作报告。因为这两个报告真实地反映了工作的实际情况，深刻地总结了工作中的经验并明确地指示了今后工作的方向。
    我是一个在政治立场上犯了严重错误的人。通过了十个月在社会主义学院的学习，最近参加河南视察组的视察和现在初步阅读了李副主席和周总理的报告，我受到了特别深刻的感动。我进一步认识到，党的领导和社会主义的道路是绝对正确的；离开党和毛主席的英明领导，离开人民群众的冲天干劲和各级干部的辛勤努力，任何社会主义革命和社会主义建设的成就是不可能设想的。因此，我必须加紧地根本改造自己，才能勉强跟得上客观上飞跃发展的形势，才能作为一个普通劳动者，为社会主义、共产主义服务。
    由于我的反动的统治阶级立场的根深蒂固，我从解放以后一系列的反动言行是极端严重的。伟大的反右斗争严肃地彻底地批判了我的反动言行，使我在悬崖危谷濒于毁灭的当儿幸而得到了挽救。反右斗争以后，党和人民不但对我特别宽大地处理，而且让我有机会参加内心里殷切希望、但是却没有勇气要求的社会主义学院的学习。我真是喜出望外；在学习中，党的耐心教育和多方关怀，同学们的严正督促和热诚帮助，处处体现了“治病救人”、“与人为善”的方针，使我开始对于自己的罪恶言行获得初步的认识。第三届全国委员会中保留我为委员，这是我作梦也想不到的。当我接到通知的时候，我的心情激动得说不出话来，但是在稍微平静以后，我不知怎的仿佛增长了一股勇气。这股勇气帮助我冲破了出去视察的思想顾虑，终于参加了河南视察组。
    我参加河南视察组，虽然短短的二十天，只到了三几个市县，但是我亲切体会到，我所接触到的每一个人，从省到县和社的干部，从工人农民到学校教职员和学生，从旧熟识的朋友到根本陌生的老大娘和小孩子，他们不但没有丝毫歧视我（其实歧视也是应该的），而且给了我各种各样的温暖和照顾。这对我是多大的鼓励！我更清楚地看到，河南和全国各地一样，从城市到乡村，从工业到农业，从文化教育卫生到集体福利，“我们的事业，各方面都在欣欣向荣，都在快步前进”。这对我又是多么深刻的教育！
    帝国主义者总是说我们不可能根本解决六亿多人的粮食问题。特别河南在解放以前是个连年灾荒的省份。可是，解放以来，它的粮食产量一直是逐年上升。例如偃师县的东寺庄，解放前的粮食平均亩产量最高不过二百多斤，解放后，一九五二年还只四百五十三斤，农业合作化后的一九五六年上升到六百七十五斤，人民公社化后的一九五八年已经达到了一千三百斤。每个人的平均吃粮，解放前最多不过二百到二百二十斤，一九五八年除去卖给国家五十九万斤以外，每个社员还可分配五百斤。而且社员们人人都有了存款。今年大面积的小麦丰产区，一块接一块，黑绿黑绿地一眼看不到边。现在可以说丰收在望。至于“吃饭不要钱”，不只是河南，全国各地的农村人民公社都已经实行了，那里还找得到在饥饿线上挣扎的人们！
    帝国主义者对于我们的社会主义工业化，压根儿就不相信。可是事实上就连工业基础几乎等于零的河南，眼看着轻重工业基地都一一建立起来了。我们看到的几个大型机械制造厂，无一不是提前完成基本建设，提前投入生产，独立设计新的品种，而且定下了今年产量翻五番的任务。它们的产品不但解决了国内的生产设备，还有一部分供应国外。它们充分发挥了共产主义大协作的精神，一方面帮助地方和公社建立许多小厂，一方面这些小厂转过来为大厂服务。公社工业化的方向，目前表现得更清楚。几个月里，郑州市一个街道公社办起了一百五十五个工厂；一个郊区公社办起了三百三十一个工厂，从食品加工到农械修造，从自给性生产到商品性生产，应有尽有。洛阳市的公社，在日用品比较紧张时，自己设法生产，居然解决了城市需要的百分之六十。像这样发展的规模和速度，帝国主义者能不在事实面前服输吗？
    帝国主义者向来对于中国人特别是中国的农民的描绘，不是愚蠢，就是肮脏。可是像我们看到的贫瘠山区的登封县，去年就已经基本上扫清了青壮年文盲，普及了中小学教育了，而且接着掀起了全民学哲学、全民写诗歌的高潮，同时还出现了不少农业科学技术的“土专家”，在改革工具、治山治水和预报天气各方面做出了出色的贡献。洛阳市的敬事街小学百分之九十以上是工农子弟，十岁左右的孩子们竟办起了“六一工厂”，大造收音机，畅销各地，为教育与劳动生产相结合放出异彩。至于基本上消灭四害的县市，全省已经有二十九个，登封县便是其中之一。这个县通过了全民体格检查和治疗，基本上消灭了甲状腺肿、梅毒、黑热病和蛔虫等十二种为害严重的病症。可见农民对于生产劳动的劲头越来越大并不是偶然的。
    在帝国主义者颠复阴谋不可能得逞的时候，一心盼望我们社会治安有问题，人和人闹不团结。可是它没有料到，像河南过去那样的盗匪横行的时光早已一去不复返了。特别是随着人民公社化和政社合一，不但管制分子由公社监督劳动，更便于专政，而且社会上民事刑事案件，甚至吵架拌嘴的纠纷也大大减少，一般群众则由于思想觉悟的提高，人和人的关系也起了深刻的变化。家庭成员间民主团结，左邻右舍倍加和睦，工厂机关学校团体间通力协作并和附近居民打成一片，公社真正成了社会主义的大家庭。有了公社这样“社会结构的基层单位”，六亿多人，在党的领导下，以共同利益共同理想为基础，团结一致不是很自然的吗？
    在我们公社化以后，帝国主义和一切反动派的造谣诬蔑特别注意家庭和劳动两个问题。在家庭问题上，我们只是打破了一个封建残余的家长制和解放了几千万的妇女劳动力。在郑州和洛阳的人民公社中，我们看到参加生产劳动的妇女们，不只是口袋里有了钱，经济上独立了，而且文化和技术水平也随着提高，特别是夫妇间有了共同的语言，感情更浓厚，团结更亲密，妇女间相互比享穿比亭受的坏风气已经被比劳动比进步所代替了。入了托儿所的小孩，学得更活泼，更有礼貌，更富于集体的友爱。登封县大冶公社的康福乐园，从妇女怀孕起，直到生产、哺乳、托儿一整套的福利设施，可以说体贴的无微不至。公共食堂，有些公社把它分成三灶七厅，也是体现了大集体小自由的精神。事情很清楚，我们并没有拆散什么家庭，我们只是把穷愁苦闷的家庭改造成为愉快美满的家庭罢了。无论旧社会或者现代资本主义国家，它们会有这样的家庭吗？然而偏偏帝国主义和一切反动派所诅咒的正是这样的家庭！报上登载，美国工人，有的迫于失业和饥饿而全家自杀；蒋匪帮在把多少青年妇女囚禁在“美军乐园”军妓院中的同时，却搞什么“幸福家庭运动”，真令人哭笑不得！在劳动问题上，我们和资本主义国家有着本质的不同。旧社会遗留下来的失业问题，我们早已解决了。但是由于工农业各方面的大跃进，劳动力仍然感到不足。在这种情况下，已经当家作主，掌握了自己命运的劳动人民，他们的热情沸腾、干劲冲天是可以理解的。例如郑州市郊区的一个公社，社员们提出了“刮风不收兵、下雨不停工”的挑战口号。登封县去冬上山搞水利，达到了二十万人，春节都不肯下山，这是强迫命令所能做到的吗？而且我们在这个县文村的一个小水库工地上，亲眼看到，一个老大娘豪迈地飞跑着挑土；两个新娘子欢笑着竞赛，交响乐似地歌唱声音从多远就听得见，这是在资产阶级剥削压迫下哭丧着脸的劳动所能比拟的吗？但是，我们解决劳动力的问题并不是靠着无限制地增加劳动强度。除去解放劳动力特别是妇女劳动力外，我们主要还是靠着改进劳动组织及革新生产工具和技术。我们要求提高劳动生产率，同时要求适当的学习、娱乐和休息。根本问题还在于，我们总是拿人当人来关怀，同帝国主义和一切反动派的拿人当牛马来看待，毫无相同之处。
    还有两件事情，由于它们的鲜明对照，给我留下的印象特别深刻。一是对于为害几千年的黄河，资本主义国家的所谓专家们，向来认为是不治之症，可是三门峡水利枢纽工程，在苏联的无私援助下，正以超过设计的速度在迅速进展，估计可以提前约两年半完成。这是征服黄河的空前胜利！蒋介石匪帮在一九三八年扒开花园口黄河大堤，泛滥了三个省的六十四个县，淹死了八十九万人，可是我们去年以一百天的工夫，在花园口附近完成了灌溉十八个县市的土地并供给郑州市工业用水的东风渠工程，使得同一花园口前后有着两个截然不同的涵义。一些像龙门、少林寺、白马寺等等名胜古迹，过去有的在军阀混战时被烧毁，有的在国内外敌人互相勾结下被盗窃破坏，现在我们都加以保护和修葺了，文物资料也在整理研究中，可是蒋匪帮目前还要把被偷运到台湾的五千多箱珍贵的历史文物送往美国去“特别展览”。这真是像毛主席所说，“它（指帝国主义和一切反动派）的本性是不能改变的！”
    听见有人传诵一位工人写的诗：“什么藤结什么瓜，什么树开什么花，什么时代爱什么人，什么阶级说什么话”。我们同帝国主义和一切反动派没有共同的好恶，也没有共同的语言，是一点也不奇怪的。
    我们到底为什么能取得这样辉煌的成就呢？无疑地，主要是由于党的领导，生产关系适应了生产力和上层建筑适应了经济基础，所以我们的社会制度发挥了它的优越性，人民公社表现了它的强大生命力，所以人民群众的创造性和积极性无限地施展出来。这就是社会发展的规律。但是帝国主义和一切反动派不高兴我们一天天地好起来，硬要否定这个规律，硬要这个规律以它们的意志为转移，这是根本办不到的。事实上既然办不到，它们只有拿诅咒别人来安慰自己。可是它们的诅咒更丝毫不能动摇我们的立场，只是对我们起了一定的反面教员作用。首先，由于它们的诅咒，证明我们确实是作对了，因而更坚定了我们对社会主义共产主义建设的信心；其次，由于它们的诅咒越来越凶，证明我们的事业是越来越蒸蒸日上，我们的生活是越来越提高了；最后，它们这样从反面刺激我们，使我们一方面越发提高警惕，一方面加倍奋勉地向着同它们的愿望相反的方向迈进，而且速度越来越加快。
    在我们这样不断的全面的大跃进当中，究竟有没有困难和缺点呢？在河南视察时，汇报工作的领导干部们从不隐饰当前的困难和缺点。但是究竟是什么性质的困难和缺点，通过这次视察，和我在反右斗争以前的几次视察比起来，我的认识是肯定地大不相同了。反右斗争以前，我几次出发视察，总是首先抱着寻找“缺点”的浓烈愿望，甚至预先设想要有那些“缺点”；视察时，便千方百计地寻找“缺点”或寻找可以附会预想的“缺点”的资料；找到了就据为独得之奇，并有意识地夸大了它，丑化了它，而且从不同任何人分析研究，便大肆宣扬，以使对方难堪为快。单就这一点来说，我的反动的政治立场不是已经昭然若揭吗？事物特别是新事物发展的过程中，矛盾和不平衡，也就是困难和缺点，是不可能完全避免的。但是我们所面临的，困难和有利条件比，有利条件是主要的；成绩和缺点比，成绩是主要的；而困难和缺点只是个别的一时的现象。事实证明，在党的领导下，解放思想，苦干苦钻，任何困难和缺点都是可以克服的，而且绝大多数已经克服了。我体察我前后视察在动机、态度和方法上的分歧，使我一方面进一步认识到我之所以成为右派并不是偶然的，一方面也感觉到我的思想立场仿佛正在开始着初步的转变。
    毛主席在“关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题”的讲演中，开头就提到“国家的统一，人民的团结”，我过去从未注意过；反右斗争以后，在学习中，有时思想上触及这个问题，但也没有深入。最近出去视察，从祖国大地的辽阔，六亿人民的旺盛，又回顾我亲身经历的六十多年来国内的政治变化，才觉察到：统一和团结是多么珍贵！毛主席指出“这是我们的事业必定要胜利的基本保证”是多么英明！总理在报告结尾，特别提出“我们的一切成就是我国全体爱国人民团结一致的力量创造的”，是包含着多么崇高的自豪感！这个统一和团结的取得，当然首先是由于党的领导。有了党的领导，六亿多人才有可能从思想立场的一致达到行动的一致，才有可能根据统一的方针路线，为共同的事业，共同的理想目标而奋斗。但是资产阶级右派（包括我在内）正是在这个问题上要走向抵抗历史潮流，违背六亿多人民意愿的反动道路。要国家四分五裂，要六亿多人水深火热，要美帝国主义和蒋匪帮卷土重来。这是多么危险的道路！想到这里，我对于我的反动言行的严重性，对于反右斗争的必要性，有了比过去更具体、更深刻的认识。
    在这次视察中，我接触过不少的劳动人民，并曾经从他们的工作和生活中很粗浅地体会过他们的思想感情。我最后感觉到，从一个剥削阶级转变为一个劳动阶级，确不是一件简单容易的事情。具体到我个人来说，在听党的话，热爱劳动，集体主义精神等等方面，我不是一般地不如劳动人民，而是远远地望尘莫及。因而在目前就不能有共同的思想感情，共同语言，当然更谈不到对社会主义事业有共同的贡献了。这对于我的加紧改造，将是很大的一个推动力量。
    没有反右斗争，我的顽固头脑不可能稍稍清醒过来。没有社会主义学院的学习，不可能在自我认识上逐渐有所提高。没有这次去河南的视察，不可能从许多生动的新鲜事物中，亲自体验到党的可爱，祖国的可爱，六亿人民的可爱，而帝国主义和一切反动派的可恨。对于一个资产阶级右派分子来说，党的一系列的政策是完全正确的。我衷心感激党的伟大和毛主席的英明。我承认一个人的阶级立场和思想意识的改造必须经过一段长期的、反复的、艰苦的斗争过程，但是，在党和毛主席的感召和教育下，在人民群众的督促和帮助下，在国内外有利形势的鼓舞下，我相信并且保证，今后在学习中、在劳动中、在工作实践中，一定能够鼓足干劲，认真进行改造，以期为社会主义共产主义的空前伟大事业贡献出自己的一切。
