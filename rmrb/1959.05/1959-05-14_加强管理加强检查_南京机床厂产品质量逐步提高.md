Strengthening Management, Strengthening Inspection
    Nanjing Machine Tool Factory's Product Quality Gradually Improves
    (Our newspaper's Nanjing dispatch, May 13th) In the movement to increase production and practice economy, the Nanjing Machine Tool Factory has gradually improved the quality of its machine tools by strengthening enterprise management and establishing a quality inspection system that combines professional management with mass participation.
    In order to ensure the rapid improvement of product quality, the Nanjing Machine Tool Factory conducted ideological education on ensuring and improving quality among all employees. At the same time, they expanded and strengthened the inspection organization. In this regard, they equipped 25 inspectors, and each workshop established a quality inspection group equipped with 29 inspectors. The production teams democratically elected quality inspectors. The factory's quality inspection team is mainly responsible for inspecting raw materials entering the factory, casting, heat treatment, assembly, and product leaving the factory. The inspection teams in each workshop are mainly responsible for inspecting the key processes of batch-processed parts. The quality inspectors of the production teams are responsible for inspecting the processing quality between processes.
    All levels of quality inspection personnel also hold regular quality analysis meetings, where they report on the product quality situation and existing problems in each period, and propose measures to improve quality.
    While comprehensively rectifying and improving the quality inspection system, the factory leadership also strengthened the management of products, production preparation, technological processes, drawings, and other aspects, and strengthened the training of new workers. After these two-pronged efforts, the quality of machine tools has recently improved significantly. The casting workshop used pig iron with a high sulfur and phosphorus content in the past, and the hardness of the castings exceeded the regulations. Now the hardness of the castings meets the processing requirements. The rework rate in the machining workshop decreased by 20% in April compared to March, the scrap rate decreased by 1%, and the precision of the machine tools can meet the design requirements.

    加强管理加强检查
    南京机床厂产品质量逐步提高
    本报南京13日电  南京机床厂在增产节约运动中，从加强企业管理，建立一套专业管理与群众参加管理相结合的质量检查制度，促使机床质量逐步提高。
    南京机床厂为了保证产品质量的迅速提高，一方面在全体职工中进行保证提高质量的思想教育，另一方面扩大和加强了检查组织，在这方面，他们配备了检查员二十五人，各车间成立了质量检查小组，配备检查员二十九人，各生产小组民主选出了质量检查员。厂的质量检查组主要负责检查原材料进厂、铸工、热处理、装配、产品出厂等方面。各车间的检查小组主要负责检查成批加工零件的关键工序。生产小组的质量检查员负责工序之间加工质量的检查。
    各级质量检查人员，还定期举行质量分析会议，会上回报每个时期的产品质量情况和存在的问题，并提出提高质量的措施。
    在全面整顿和健全质量检查制度的同时，工厂领导方面还加强了制品、生产准备、工艺流程、图纸等方面的管理工作，并加强了新工人的培训工作。这样双管齐下以后，最近机床质量已经有显著的提高。铸工车间使用的是含硫磷较高的土铁，过去铸件硬度超过规定，现在铸件硬度已经合乎加工要求。加工车间的返修率4月份比3月份下降20％，废品率下降1％，机床的精密度都能达到设计要求。
