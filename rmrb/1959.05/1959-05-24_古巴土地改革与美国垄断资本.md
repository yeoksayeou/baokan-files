Cuban Land Reform and U.S. Monopoly Capital

    The Cuban Council of Ministers of the Provisional Government promulgated the Land Reform Law on the 17th, abolishing the large estate system and stipulating that any joint-stock company whose shares are not held by Cubans, or which does not have Cubans as shareholders or managers, cannot operate sugarcane plantations, and non-Cuban citizens are not allowed to purchase any rural property. As a result, all foreign sugar companies, mainly U.S. sugar companies, which in the past enjoyed various privileges in Cuba and controlled the economic lifeline of Cuba, will have to relinquish the sugarcane plantations they used to exploit the Cuban people.

    Due to long-term political control and economic plunder by imperialism, Cuba, like many other Latin American countries, has developed a deformed single economy, mainly producing sugar. Sugarcane fields account for 56% of the country's arable land, and its sugar production and exports rank first in the world. The output in 1958 was 5.6 million tons, and it is estimated that this year's output will reach 5.8 million tons. Income from sugar accounts for 30%-40% of Cuba's national income, and exports of sugar and molasses account for 90% of Cuba's exports. From this, it can be seen the importance of sugarcane cultivation to Cuba's economic development.

    However, most of the land and sugarcane fields in Cuba do not belong to the Cuban people, but to a few large landowners and U.S. monopoly capital. U.S. monopoly capital is the main large landowner in Cuba, owning nearly 75% of the fertile land, and the sugarcane plantations it controls account for 35% of all sugarcane plantations in Cuba.

    According to statistics, twenty-three U.S. companies own or lease a total of 108,000 caballerias of land in Cuba (one caballeria equals 13.43 hectares). Adding the more than 50,000 caballerias of mining areas and other industries that U.S. companies have concessions for, they control a total of more than 160,000 caballerias of land.

    The U.S. monopoly capital groups that own large sugar mills, sugarcane plantations, and large sugar companies in Cuba include: the "Manati Sugar Company" and "Francisco Sugar Company," etc., controlled by the Rockefeller Consortium's New York Schroder Bank. During the Batista dictatorship, the United States almost became the only market for Cuban sugar. It manipulated Cuban sugar prices and stipulated sugar import quotas, controlling the main economic lifeline of Cuba. Therefore, after the Cuban Revolution, U.S. imperialism still attempted to interfere in the Cuban Revolution in every possible way by taking advantage of its monopoly position in the Cuban economy and the fact that most of Cuba's sugar needed to be sold to the United States. The United States not only reduced sugar imports, but also lowered sugar prices, causing difficulties for Cuba's economy and foreign exchange balance. This year, it is estimated that Cuba's foreign exchange earnings will be reduced by 100 million U.S. dollars due to the U.S. lowering sugar prices. However, the new Cuban government did not succumb to U.S. interference and pressure. Now, Cuba's land reform law will deal a heavy blow to U.S. monopoly capital. (Zhen)

    古巴土地改革与美国垄断资本
    古巴临时政府部长会议在17日颁布了土地改革法，废除大庄园制度，并规定任何股份公司的股票如果不是由古巴人持有，或者没有古巴人做股东或管理者，就不能经营甘蔗园，非古巴公民一律不得购买任何农村产业。这样一来，过去在古巴境内享有种种特权而控制了古巴经济命脉的所有外国糖公司主要是美国糖公司，将要让出它们借以剥削古巴人民的甘蔗种植园了。
    由于帝国主义长期的政治控制和经济掠夺，古巴像其他许多拉丁美洲国家一样发展着畸形的单一经济，主要是出产食糖。全国拥有的蔗田面积占可耕地的56％，它的糖产量和输出量都占世界第一位。1958年的产量是五百六十万吨，估计今年产量将达五百八十万吨。蔗糖的收入占古巴国民收入的30％—40％，糖和糖浆的出口占古巴出口的90％。由此可以看出甘蔗的种植对古巴的经济发展的重要意义。
  但是，古巴大部分的土地和蔗田并不属于古巴人民，而是属于少数大庄园主和美国垄断资本。美国垄断资本是古巴主要的大庄园主，它们占有将近75％的肥沃土地，它们所控制的甘蔗种植园占古巴全部甘蔗种植园的35％。
    据统计，美国二十三家公司在古巴所拥有或根据契约租用的土地，共达十万八千卡瓦耶里亚（每卡瓦耶里亚等于一三点四三公顷），加上美国公司所享有租让权的五万多卡瓦耶里亚的矿区和其他产业，共控制十六万多卡瓦耶里亚土地。
    在古巴拥有庞大的制糖厂、甘蔗种植园和大糖业公司的美国垄断资本集团有：洛克菲勒财团的纽约施罗德银行所控制的“马纳提糖业公司”和“弗兰西斯科糖业公司”等。在巴蒂斯塔独裁时期，美国几乎成了古巴糖的唯一市场，它操纵了古巴的糖价并规定了糖的入口定额，掌握了古巴的主要经济命脉。因此，古巴革命后，美帝国主义仍然企图利用它对古巴经济的垄断地位和古巴食糖大部分需要销售美国的条件，百般干涉古巴革命。美国不但减少食糖进口，而且还压低糖价，使古巴经济和外汇收支发生困难。今年估计古巴的外汇收入，由于美国压低糖价，将减少一亿美元。但古巴新政府并没有向美国的干涉和压力屈服。现在古巴的土地改革法，将使美国垄断资本遭到沉重的打击。　（贞）
