Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, May 26th: Shanghai's workers' spare-time schools are closely integrating with factory production to improve teaching work.

Recently, more than 3,000 workers' spare-time schools throughout the city, under the leadership of the CPC district committees, successively summarized the experience of vigorously running workers' spare-time schools last year. At the same time, in accordance with the educational principles of "integrating with production, unified planning, teaching according to aptitude, and flexibility and diversity," they have adopted many specific measures in organizing leadership, training teachers, improving teaching, and rationally arranging time. At present, large and medium-sized factories in the city have basically equipped their spare-time schools with full-time principals or administrative leaders, and under the direct leadership of the CPC committee, have established organizations such as school affairs committees composed of representatives from the factory's administration, trade union, and Communist Youth League. The city already has a contingent of more than 37,000 workers' spare-time teachers. The schools have not only set up political and cultural courses, but also opened different technical courses according to the production situation of their respective industries, playing a significant role in promoting the factory's technical innovation and technical revolution movement and improving labor productivity.

Many factories have implemented teaching methods that classify students according to their different characteristics and requirements, and teach according to their aptitude. The Shanghai No. 1 Motorized Hosiery Factory's production task this year has increased four to five times compared to last year, with many technical innovation projects, but the factory's technical strength is insufficient. The factory's spare-time school has separated experienced veteran workers from young workers, organized seven key technical classes for veteran workers in repair, lathe, fitter, and electrician work with different school systems, and lectured more on technical theory knowledge in order to train them into technicians or engineers; for young workers, eight technical classes were opened according to their types of work to teach technical operation and other knowledge. In a month and a half, the weaving workshop trained more than 300 loom operators. The Shanghai No. 4 Printing and Dyeing Factory and others, in addition to teaching in separate classes, also adopted the elective course method for veteran workers, that is, some cultural and technical courses can be selected by them according to their needs or learned in advance. As a result, the number of students enrolled in these factories has generally increased, and the attendance rate in class has remained above 90%.

Some factories also arrange teaching work according to the annual production tasks, so that the teaching content is more closely coordinated with current production. For example, the technical courses of the old workers' mechanical class at the Da Zhong Porcelain Electrical Factory are arranged according to the production schedule and the task of trial-producing new products. The course includes lectures on the structure and trial production process of new products such as 110 kV high-voltage electrical porcelain and cast current transformers, and technical theory is taught according to the needs of trial-producing these new products. In addition, in addition to classroom teaching, a certain amount of experimental time is arranged, combined with the factory's technical innovation.

Many factories have proven through ten months of running schools that doing a good job in remedial teaching plays a significant role in consolidating spare-time schools. Because workers are highly mobile in busy production tasks, the school tries to provide them with remedial lessons, so that workers will not fall behind in their studies and can persist in spare-time learning for a long time. Now all factories in Shanghai have fixed remedial time. Some factories have also held correspondence tutoring for workers on business trips to other places. According to a survey and statistics conducted by the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau in more than 20 factories, about 6% to 8% of the total number of students enrolled in each factory can persist in learning because they receive remedial lessons.

At present, the Shanghai Municipality and the education departments of Yangpu, Jiangning and other districts where factories are concentrated have organized working groups or central teaching groups to conduct in-depth investigations and studies in different types of factories on the learning conditions of workers and the laws of teaching in spare-time schools and the methods of teaching well and learning well, and are gradually summarizing the experience of cultural class organization, teacher training, and teaching methods in more than 100 key workers' spare-time schools in the urban area, so as to further improve and develop the city's workers' spare-time schools in a comprehensive way.

    密切结合生产改进教学工作
    上海提高职工业余教育质量
    新华社上海26日电  上海市的职工业余学校密切结合工厂生产改进教学工作。
    最近，全市三千多所职工业余学校在中共各区党委领导下，先后总结了去年大办职工业余学校的经验。同时，根据“结合生产、统一安排、因材施教、灵活多样”的办学原则，在组织领导、师资培养、改进教学、合理安排时间等方面采取许多具体措施。目前，全市大、中型工厂举办的业余学校基本上都配备有专职校长或行政工作领导干部，并且在中共党委直接领导下，成立了由全厂行政、工会、共青团的代表参加的校务委员会等组织。全市已有一支拥有三万七千多人的职工业余教师队伍。各校不仅设置了政治课和文化课，并且根据本行业生产情况开设了不同的技术课程，对推动工厂技术革新和技术革命运动、提高劳动生产率起了很大的作用。
    许多工厂推行了按照工人不同特点、不同要求分别编班，因材施教的教学方法。上海第一电机织袜厂今年生产任务比去年增加四、五倍，技术革新项目很多，而厂里技术力量很不足。工厂业余学校就把生产经验丰富的老工人同青年工人分别编班，为老工人举办不同学制的修机、车工、钳工、电工等七个重点技术班，多讲技术理论知识，以便把他们培养成技工或技师；对青年工人则按工种开设八个技术班，讲授技术操作等知识。在一个半月中，织造车间就培训出三百多个挡车工。上海第四印染厂等在分别编班教学外，还对老工人采取选科办法，即有些文化、技术课程可以由他们根据需要选修或提前学习。这些工厂的职工入学人数因此普遍增加，上课出席率都保持在90％以上。
    有些工厂还按照年度的生产任务安排教学工作，使教学内容更密切地配合当前生产。如大中瓷电厂老工人机械班的技术课程，就是根据生产进度和试制新产品的任务安排的，课程中有讲授试制一百一十千伏高压电瓷、浇注式电流互感器等新产品的结构和试制过程，同时根据试制这些新产品的需要讲授一部分技术理论。另外，除课堂教学外，还安排了一定的试验时间，同工厂的技术革新结合起来。
    许多工厂经过十个月办学的经验证明，做好补课工作对巩固业余学校有很大作用。因为在繁忙的生产任务中，工人流动性大，学校设法为他们补课，工人在学习上就不致掉队，可以长期坚持业余学习。现在上海各工厂大都有固定的补课时间。有些工厂还为到外埠出差的工人举办了函授补习。据上海市教育局在二十多个工厂调查统计，工人们由于得到补课能坚持学习的，约占各厂入学总人数的6％到8％。
    目前，上海市和工厂集中的杨浦、江宁等区教育部门都组织了工作组或中心教学组，在不同类型工厂深入调查研究职工学习条件以及业余学校教学的规律和教好学好的方法，并且在市区的一百多个重点职工业余学校中逐步总结文化课编班、师资培养、教学方法等的经验，以点带面地使全市的职工业余学校得到进一步提高与发展。
