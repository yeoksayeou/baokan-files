On "Disclosure"
　　Cheng Jingye

　　"Disclosure" to the masses is a fine tradition of the Party and a key to implementing the Party's mass line.

　　To accomplish a task, the first step is to "disclose" the task, its rationale, and methods to the masses and to conduct thorough debates among them. This is our Party's fine democratic tradition. In our Party's history, this approach has been used not only in social reform work but also in military work. As everyone knows, the Chinese People's Liberation Army practices political, military, and economic democracy. Before each battle, "brainstorming sessions" and "Zhuge Liang meetings" are held to "disclose" the battle task to commanders and soldiers, organizing them to fully discuss methods for completing the battle task. Undoubtedly, in the current socialist construction, we can and should do the same. In fact, both on the agricultural and industrial fronts, numerous examples show that when attention is paid to "disclosing" the state's policies, tasks, and various planned targets to the masses, and when the wisdom and experience of the masses are fully absorbed, right-leaning conservative thoughts are more easily overcome, planned tasks are more practical, measures are more specific, and cadres and the masses are more motivated and confident. As a result, the completion of the task is better guaranteed. Wherever plans and tasks are formulated and executed relying only on a few people's discussions, without "disclosure" to the masses or organizing them for debate, things are cold and cheerless, and there is no reliable guarantee that the planned tasks will be completed.

　　The issue of "disclosure" to the masses is essentially a matter of trust in the masses and of implementing the Party's mass line. We Communists must adopt the mass line and scientific leadership methods in all our work. The so-called mass line and scientific leadership methods are the famous scientific formula summarized by the Party Central Committee in the long practice of the Chinese revolution: "From the masses, to the masses, concentrate, and persevere." It is also what Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out in "Some Questions Concerning Methods of Leadership": "In all the practical work of our Party, all correct leadership is invariably 'from the masses, to the masses.' This means: take the ideas of the masses (scattered and unsystematic ideas) and concentrate them (through study turn them into concentrated and systematic ideas), then go to the masses and propagate and explain these ideas until the masses embrace them as their own, hold fast to them and translate them into action, and test the correctness of these ideas in such action. Then once again concentrate ideas from the masses and once again go to the masses so that the ideas are persevered in and carried through. And so on, over and over again in an endless spiral, with the ideas becoming more correct, more vital and richer each time." In socialist construction, "disclosure" to the masses means first telling them the state's policies, tasks, and various planned targets, explaining why we should do this and how, mobilizing and organizing the masses to fully discuss, and then concentrating the masses' opinions, analyzing and studying them, and supplementing and revising various tasks and planned targets. This not only ensures that the determination of various tasks and planned targets is neither conservative nor lacking a reliable basis, and is as close to reality as possible or in line with reality, but also makes the masses feel that you have given your heart to them, that you breathe the same air as them, thereby further encouraging their consciousness of accelerating socialist construction and turning all work decisions and plans into conscious actions of the masses.

　　Unwillingness to "disclose" to the masses means a lack of mass viewpoint, forgetting that the masses are the masters of our socialist construction.

　　Currently, not everyone deeply understands the importance and necessity of "disclosure" to the masses. Some people say, "Now the Party's prestige is very high, and the masses' awareness is also very high. When the Party issues a call, the masses resolutely guarantee completion. Therefore, there is no need to emphasize 'disclosure' anymore." Others say, "There are no difficulties, no need for 'disclosure.' With difficulties, 'disclosure' will only create ideological confusion." In industrial and mining enterprises, some people also say, "Industry is different from agriculture, and industrial production and construction require a high degree of centralization and unified command. After 'disclosure,' there will be much discussion. Whose opinion should we listen to? If not done well, it will only create ideological confusion." In short, there are some people who do not quite agree with or do not agree at all with "disclosure" to the masses. They are accustomed to simplistic working methods, unilaterally emphasizing the use of administrative orders. They regard "disclosure" as "superfluous." They may verbally support democratic centralism and the mass line, but in reality, they are detached from the masses and act arbitrarily. Clearly, this is an extremely harmful tendency of bureaucratism and commandism that is divorced from the masses and divorced from reality, and it must be overcome.

　　People who do not value "disclosure" to the masses or are unwilling to "disclose" to the masses are mainly due to their lack of a mass viewpoint of relying on and trusting the masses. They do not understand or do not truly understand that our cause is the cause of the people, that the masses are the masters of socialist construction, and that to achieve the development and victory of socialist construction, we cannot leave the active support and conscious action of the people. Any hero will achieve nothing if he is detached from the masses. Comrade Liu Shaoqi said in "On the Party" that the masses "are the real creators of history, and true history is the history of the people." Indeed, historical facts tell us that in class struggle, the people are the basic motive force of the revolution, constantly promoting social progress, and in social production, the people are the production army, creating material and spiritual wealth, not those who call themselves "heroes." If anyone does not believe this, let him look at the earth-shaking leap forward on the industrial and agricultural fronts, one upsurge after another, one victory after another, targets constantly broken, miracles constantly emerging. Imagine, without the correct leadership of the Party and the conscious and voluntary action of the masses, who would have such great ability to create such a great situation? Therefore, a true revolutionary not only loves the masses but also believes in them, relies on them, believes that the masses "liberate themselves" (Marx), consults with the masses on matters, is good at listening to and adopting the correct opinions of the masses, and relies on the masses to complete all tasks.

　　In times of difficulty, we must trust the masses and rely on the masses; in times of victory, we must also trust the masses and rely on the masses.

　　True revolutionary workers, at any time and under any circumstances, firmly believe in and rely on the masses. In times of difficulty, we certainly believe in and rely on the masses; in times of victory, we also believe in and rely on the masses. The higher the awareness of the masses and the stronger their sense of ownership, the more they demand that we consult with them on matters and the more it benefits us to consult with them on matters. Only if we are not arrogant or rash in the face of victory and continue to rely on the masses can we lead the cause of socialist construction from victory to greater victory.

　　The Party's mass line is the fundamental political line of our Party and also the fundamental organizational line of our Party. Therefore, at any time, this line should be implemented without exception. However, some people are often conscientious when they first take up construction posts or when they encounter more difficulties in production and construction, contacting the masses, consulting with them on matters, and humbly asking for their advice. When they become familiar with the situation or achieve some results, they become arrogant and complacent, no longer standing among the masses but standing above them, issuing orders. These people do not understand that anyone, under any circumstances, no matter how great the victory has been, is bound to make serious mistakes if he is detached from the masses. The greater the victory and the higher the Party's prestige among the masses, the more we should pay attention to maintaining close ties with the masses, following the mass line, and guarding against the growth of bureaucratism and commandism. As the Party often warns us: In the entire revolutionary struggle in the past, the Party, the government, and the army lived with the people every day, eating what they ate, wearing what they wore, and doing what they did. The masses knew us, and we knew the masses. We understood each other and trusted each other. Therefore, we overcame many difficult difficulties, finally defeated the enemy, and won the victory. But in the victorious situation, some of our comrades became arrogant and careless, and the tendency to be detached from the masses grew. This requires close attention. The more victorious the revolution, the more we must prevent arrogance and complacency and detachment from the masses, and the more we must sincerely and humbly consult with the masses on matters and maintain close ties with them.

　　The interests of the masses and the interests of the state are consistent. Being responsible to the masses is being responsible to the Party and the state. "Disclosure" is not only being responsible to the masses but also being responsible to the Party and the state.

　　It is correct that industrial production and construction require a high degree of centralization and unified command. However, there is no reason why we should not "disclose" to the masses or follow the mass line. We know that the principle of socialist enterprise management is the opposite of capitalism. It must be to build a highly centralized management on the basis of a high degree of democracy, because only a high degree of democracy can bring into play the enthusiasm and creativity of the masses, and can achieve a high degree of centralization on the basis of collective wisdom and fully developing the enthusiasm of the masses. However, some people only see that modern industrial enterprises are highly rigorous production organizations, only emphasize the need to implement highly centralized management, and ignore the other equally important aspect of democratization in enterprise management. They completely oppose democracy and centralization, as if both democracy and centralization are impossible, and do not understand that the management system of socialist enterprises is a system that correctly combines a high degree of democracy and a high degree of centralization, which is the concrete application of our Party's principle of democratic centralism (centralization on the basis of democracy and democracy under the guidance of centralization). We say that socialist enterprises must not only rely on all the achievements of science and technology, and seriously implement various management systems that are in line with reality, but also attach great importance to all the beneficial initiatives for improving production technology and labor organization put forward by the workers and masses from production practice. It is correct to attach importance to science and technology and rational management systems, to attach importance to normal production and strengthen business management, but it is wrong to develop from this to being unwilling to "disclose" to the masses, to not listen to the opinions of the masses, and even to not adopt the correct initiatives of the masses. As Chairman Mao said to Xinhua News Agency reporters after inspecting the north and south of the Yangtze River last year: "In some places and some enterprises, the work of mobilizing the masses has not been done well, no mass meetings have been held, and the tasks, reasons, and methods have not been explained clearly to the masses, and debates have not been launched among the masses. Until now, some of our comrades are unwilling to engage in large-scale mass movements in the industrial field. They describe engaging in mass movements on the industrial front as 'irregular' and degrade it as 'rural style' and 'guerrilla habits,' which is obviously wrong."

　　People who are unwilling or dare not "disclose" to the masses often oppose being responsible to the state and being responsible to the masses. They believe that if they "disclose" to the masses, the masses may not be able to accept it, which will cause ideological confusion and damage the interests of the Party and the state. These people may be "well-intentioned," but the results are not good. They do not understand that the interests of the masses and the interests of the state are fundamentally consistent. Therefore, being responsible to the masses is being responsible to the Party and the state, and being responsible to the Party and the state is being responsible to the masses. Of course, under certain circumstances, the personal and immediate interests of the workers and masses may conflict with the long-term interests of the state. We should understand that this contradiction is a contradiction based on fundamental consistency, which can be completely unified through patient persuasion and education. In fact, the vast masses, in the Great Leap Forward, working hard selflessly and forgetting to eat and sleep, are not the specific manifestation of personal interests obeying state interests and immediate interests obeying long-term interests? Therefore, it is unrealistic to estimate that all the masses are equally aware and not to do specific ideological work, especially to care about the ideological situation of intermediate elements and individual backward elements, and to require everyone to meet the standards of active elements. However, it is also wrong if we do not see that the awareness of the masses is generally and continuously improving, and do not believe that the masses can correctly handle the relationship between personal and collective interests. The correct approach is to implement various policies and tasks stipulated by the Party and the state with a high degree of principle and a serious and responsible attitude. If these regulations and tasks conflict with the temporary interests of a small number of the masses, or if the masses do not understand the importance and urgency of the task for a while, they should be patiently persuaded and educated to improve the awareness of the masses, encourage the courage of the masses, and increase the confidence of the masses, so that the masses consciously obey the interests of the state and strive to complete the tasks assigned by the state. If it is found that the decisions of the superiors do not conform to the actual situation at the time and place, or that their own plans are too conservative or lack scientific analysis, they should adhere to the spirit of being responsible to the Party and to the masses, make suggestions to the superiors and request corrections, or accept criticism from the masses and modify their plans. Otherwise, they will not be responsible to the masses or to the Party and the state.

　　"Disclosure" to the masses is a meticulous ideological and organizational work, and it should be done seriously, not perfunctorily.

　　The issue of "disclosure" to the masses is not only a question of mass viewpoint but also a very in-depth and meticulous ideological and organizational work. If we want to "disclose," we must do it seriously and repeatedly, not casually, roughly, or simply. We must not only "disclose" the key problems in realizing the plan but also the main measures to overcome the key and complete the plan; we must not only "disclose" the favorable conditions in the work but also the difficulties that may be encountered in the work. After "disclosure" to the masses, we must conscientiously mobilize and organize the masses to conduct in-depth and meticulous discussions, so as to fully absorb the wisdom and experience of the masses, and truly achieve clear goals, key points, specific measures, and a firm understanding in the hearts of cadres and the masses. To achieve these requirements, according to the experience of units that have done a better job of "disclosure," we should generally grasp four links in the "disclosure" process: First, investigate the bottom before "disclosure." That is, before "disclosure," we should roughly find out the potential bottom, the ideological situation bottom, and the difference between advanced and backward. In this way, we can have a rough idea in our minds when "disclosing," and aim at the target, and at the same time, make the leaders' arrangements roughly close to reality or in line with reality. Second, combine "disclosure" with education. Realizing the Leap Forward plan means promoting the development of production, so there must be an advanced and continuously revolutionary ideological foundation. Therefore, we should transform the process of "disclosure" into a process of conducting practical and vivid socialist and communist education to the masses, so that the masses can understand the political and economic significance of completing the national plan, the relationship between completing individual plans and the entire country, so as to improve the awareness of the masses. Third, combine "disclosure" with comparison. It is difficult to imagine that the plans and measures formulated without comparison are advanced and reliable plans and measures. When "disclosing," in order to inspire the masses to compare with the advanced, learn from the advanced, catch up with the advanced, and surpass the advanced, we must put out the opposites of advanced and backward, and inspire the masses to find out the reasons for advanced and backward. In this way, we will actually organically combine the work of "disclosure" with mobilizing and organizing the masses to carry out the socialist competition of comparing with the advanced, learning from the advanced, catching up with the advanced, and surpassing the advanced. In this way, the plans and measures can be formulated both advanced and reliable, and the workers and masses can exert greater efforts, you chase me and I catch up with you, the backward catch up with the advanced, and the advanced become even more advanced. Fourth, combine "disclosure" with debate. After "disclosure," we must conduct full debates among the masses. Practice has proved that not only should ideological problems be debated in a mass way, but scientific and technological problems should also be organized for mass debate. The more truth is debated, the clearer it becomes, and the more methods are debated, the more they become. Through debate, we can not only listen to the opinions of the masses to a greater extent and concentrate the wisdom of the masses, making the plans and measures more advanced and implemented, but also make the understanding of the masses clearer, making the completion of the tasks and plans truly based on a broad and conscious basis of the masses.

　　At present, a new upsurge of the Great Leap Forward in socialist construction is taking shape, and the broad masses have mustered more revolutionary energy than in 1958, and are enthusiastically striving to complete and overfulfill this year's national plan. We should carry forward the Party's democratic tradition. All policies, tasks, and planned targets must be discussed with the masses, respect the opinions of the masses, and obtain their consent. As long as we conscientiously "disclose" to the masses, conscientiously mobilize and organize the masses to conduct debates, and speak freely, cross swords in many ways, opposing sides can be established, contradictions can be revealed, truth can be found, the movement can be launched, and the task can be successfully completed.

　　谈“交底”
　　程精业
    向群众“交底”是党的优良传统，是贯彻党的群众路线的关键
　　要完成任务，首先将任务、理由、方法向群众“交底”，并在群众中进行充分的辩论，这是我们党的优良的民主传统。在我们党的历史上，不仅进行社会改革工作是这样做的，就是军事工作也是这样做的，正如大家所熟悉的，在中国人民解放军中，有政治民主、军事民主和经济民主，部队在每次战斗以前，都召开“想办法会”“诸葛亮会”，把战斗任务向指战员“交底”，组织指战员充分讨论完成战斗任务的办法。毫无疑问，在当前社会主义建设事业中，也完全可以而且应该这样做，事实上，不论是农业战线或是工业战线，都有大量的事例说明：凡是注意把国家方针、任务和各项计划指标向群众“交底”，并充分地吸取了群众的智慧和经验的，右倾保守思想就比较易于克服，计划任务就比较切合实际，措施就订得比较具体，干部和群众的干劲就更足，信心也就更大，从而任务的完成也就更有保证。凡是计划、任务只是依靠几个人议论议论就布置执行，既不向群众“交底”，又不去组织群众辩论的地方，就冷冷清清，计划任务能否完成，就没有可靠的保证。
    向群众“交底”的问题，实质上是对群众信任与否的问题，是贯彻执行党的群众路线问题。我们共产党人，无论进行何项工作，都必须采用群众路线的、科学的领导方法。所谓群众路线的、科学的领导方法，就是党中央在中国革命的长期实践中，总结出来的著名的科学公式：“从群众中来，到群众中去，集中起来，坚持下去”。也是毛泽东同志在“关于领导方法的若干问题”中所指出的：“在我党的一切实际工作中，凡属正确的领导，必须是从群众中来，到群众中去。这就是说，将群众的意见（分散的无系统的意见）集中起来（经过研究，化为集中的系统的意见），又到群众中去作宣传解释，化为群众的意见，使群众坚持下去，见之于行动，并在群众行动中考验这些意见是否正确，然后再从群众中集中起来，再到群众中坚持下去。如此无限循环，一次比一次地更正确、更生动、更丰富。这就是马克思主义的认识论。”在社会主义建设中，向群众“交底”，就是为了把国家的方针、任务、各项计划指标，首先告诉群众，把为什么要这样办，怎样办，向群众讲清楚，发动和组织群众充分讨论，然后把群众的意见集中起来，经过分析研究，补充、修正各项任务和各项计划指标，这样不仅使各项任务和各项计划指标的确定既不保守，又有充分可靠的依据，尽可能地接近实际，或符合实际，而且会使群众进一步感到你是把心交给了他们，和他们呼吸相通，从而也就更加鼓舞了他们加速社会主义建设的自觉性，使一切工作决定、计划，变成了群众的自觉行动。
    不愿向群众“交底”，就是没有群众观点，就是忘掉了群众是我们社会主义建设的主人
    目前，对于向群众“交底”的重要性和必要性，并不是所有的人都已经深刻理解的。有的人说：“现在党的威信很高，群众觉悟也很高，党一声号召，群众坚决保证完成，因此，不必再强调‘交底’。”也有的人说：“没有什么困难，不必‘交底’。有困难，
  ‘交底’反而会造成思想混乱。”在工矿企业中还有人说：“工业和农业不同，搞工业和搞社会改革也不同，工业生产建设需要高度的集中，需要统一指挥，‘交底’后，议论纷纷，究竟听谁的好，搞不好反而会造成思想混乱。”总之，有这么一些人，他们是不大赞成，或者根本不赞成向群众“交底”的，他们习惯于简单化的工作方法，片面地强调运用行政命令办事。把“交底”视为“多此一举”，他们也许口头上拥护民主集中制，赞成群众路线，可是实际上却是脱离群众，一意孤行。显然，这是一种极其有害的脱离群众、脱离实际的官僚主义和命令主义的倾向，必须加以克服。
    不重视向群众“交底”，或者不愿向群众“交底”的人，主要是由于他们缺乏依靠群众，相信群众的群众观点。他们不懂得或者没有真正懂得我们的事业是人民群众的事业，群众是社会主义建设事业的主人，要取得社会主义建设事业的发展和胜利，就一刻也不能离开人民群众的积极支持和自觉行动。任何英雄好汉如果脱离群众，他就一事无成。刘少奇同志在“论党”中说群众“是历史的真正创造者，真正的历史是人民群众的历史”。确实，历史的事实告诉我们，在阶级斗争中，组成革命基本动力的，不断推动社会进步的固然是人民群众，在社会生产上，组成生产大军的，创造物质、精神财富的也是人民群众，而不是那些自命“英雄豪杰”的人，谁如果不相信这一点，不妨请他看一看工农业战线惊天动地的跃进局面，一个高潮接着一个高潮，一个胜利接着一个胜利，指标不断突破，奇迹不断涌现，试想不是党的正确领导，不是群众的自觉自愿行动，谁有这样大的本领造成这样伟大的局面，所以，一个真正革命者，他不但热爱群众，而且相信群众，依靠群众，相信群众“劳动者自己解放自己”（马克思），有事和群众商量，善于听取和采纳群众的正确意见，并且依靠群众去完成一切任务。
    在困难的时候，要相信群众，依靠群众，在胜利的时候，同样要相信群众，依靠群众
    真正的革命工作者，不论在任何时候，任何情况下，都是坚定不移地相信群众，依靠群众的。在困难的时候，固然相信群众，依靠群众，在胜利的时候，同样相信群众，依靠群众，群众的觉悟越高，主人翁责任感越强，越要求我们办事和他们商量，也越有利于我们和他们商量办事。只有我们在胜利面前不骄不躁，继续依靠群众，才可以使社会主义建设事业，从胜利引向更大的胜利。
    党的群众路线，是我们党的根本政治路线，也是我们党的根本的组织路线。因此不论在什么时候，都应该无例外地贯彻这一路线，可是，有些人在开始走上建设岗位的时候，或者在生产建设中碰到比较多的困难的时候，往往还是兢兢业业，联系群众，有事和群众商量，虚心请教群众，当他们熟悉了情况，或者取得一些成绩的时候，就骄傲自满起来，不再是站在群众之中，而是站在群众之上，发号施令。这些人不懂得，任何人不论在什么情况下，不管已经取得多大的胜利，一旦脱离群众，总是免不了要犯严重的错误。胜利越大，党在群众中威信越高，就越要注意密切联系群众，走群众路线，警惕官僚主义和命令主义的滋长。正如党经常告诫我们的：在过去的整个革命斗争过程中，党、政府、军队与人民群众每天生活在一起，吃的什么，穿的什么，做的什么，群众知道我们，我们也知道群众，彼此了解，互相信任，因此，克服了很多的艰巨的困难，终于打败了敌人，获得了胜利。但在胜利的形势下，我们有一些同志就骄傲了，不谨慎了，滋长了脱离群众的倾向，这是要严加注意的。革命愈是胜利，越要防止骄傲自满和脱离群众，越发要真诚地谦逊地同群众商量办事，密切联系群众。
    群众利益和国家利益是一致的，对群众负责就是对党、对国家负责，“交底”，既是对群众负责，也是对党和国家负责
    工业生产建设需要高度的集中和统一的指挥，这是对的。但是，丝毫也没有理由因此可以不要向群众“交底”，不走群众路线。我们知道，社会主义的企业管理原则与资本主义相反，必须是把高度集中的管理，建立在高度民主的基础上，因为只有高度的民主，才能把群众的积极性和创造性发扬起来，才能在集思广益和充分发扬群众积极性的基础上，达到高度的集中。但是，有些人只看到现代化工业企业是一个高度严密的生产组织，只强调必须实行高度集中管理这一方面，而忽视在企业管理上，同样重要的民主化的另一方面，他们把民主和集中完全对立起来，似乎既要民主就无法集中，而不懂得社会主义企业的管理制度，就是把高度的民主和高度的集中正确地结合起来的一种制度，也就是我们党的民主集中制（在民主基础上的集中和集中指导下的民主）原则的具体运用。我们说，社会主义的企业，不但必须依靠科学技术的一切成果，认真推行切合实际的各种管理制度，而且必须很重视职工群众从生产实践中所提出来的改进生产技术和劳动组织的一切有益倡议。那种重视科学技术和合理管理制度，重视正常生产和加强经营管理是正确的，但是由此发展到不愿向群众“交底”，不去倾听群众的意见，甚至不去采纳群众的正确倡议，就不对了，正如毛主席去年巡视大江南北后对新华社记者所说的：“有一些地方，有一些企业，对于发动群众的工作还没有做好，没有开群众大会，没有将任务、理由和方法，向群众讲得清清楚楚，并在群众中展开辩论。到现在，我们还有一些同志不愿意在工业方面搞大规模的群众运动，他们把在工业战线上搞群众运动，说成是‘不正规’，贬之为‘农村作风’、‘游击习气’，这显然是不对的。”
    不愿或者不敢向群众“交底”的人，往往把对国家负责和对群众负责对立起来，他们认为向群众“交底”，群众可能接受不了，反而会引起思想混乱，损害党和国家的利益。这些人也许是出之“好心肠”，可是得出的并不是好结果。他们不懂得：群众的利益和国家的利益，从根本上说是一致的。因此，对群众负责，也就是对党、对国家负责，对党对国家负责也就是对群众负责，当然，在一定的情况下，职工群众的个人的、眼前的利益，可能和国家的、长远的利益有矛盾，应该懂得这种矛盾，是在根本一致的基础上的矛盾，只要经过耐心的说服教育，是完全可以统一起来的。事实上，广大群众在大跃进中，不计报酬，废寝忘食地辛勤劳动，不正是个人利益服从国家利益，眼前利益服从长远利益的具体表现吗？因此，把所有群众的觉悟都估计得一样的很高，而不去做具体的思想工作，特别关心中间分子和个别落后分子的思想情况，一律以积极分子的水平要求所有的人，是不实际的。但是，如果看不到群众觉悟普遍在不断提高，不相信群众能正确处理个人与集体利益的关系，也是不对的。正确的做法就是，以高度的原则精神与严肃认真的态度执行党和国家所规定的各项政策与任务，如果这些规定、任务与少数群众的暂时利益发生矛盾，或者确实由于群众一时还不理解任务的重要性和迫切性，应该耐心地说服教育，提高群众的觉悟，鼓励群众的勇气，增加群众的信心，使群众自觉地服从国家利益，并为完成国家所交予的任务而努力。如果发现上级的决定不合当时当地的实际情况，或者自己的计划偏于保守或缺乏科学分析，就应当坚持对党和对群众负责的精神，给上级提出建议，请求改正，或者接受群众批评，修改自己的计划。否则，既没有对群众负责，也没有对党和国家负责。
    向群众“交底”是个细致的思想工作和组织工作，要认真交底，不能敷衍了事
    向群众“交底”问题，不只是一个群众观点问题，而且也是一个十分深入细致的思想工作和组织工作。既要交底，就要认真地交，反复地交，不能马马虎虎地交，粗枝大叶地交，一交了事。不仅要交在实现计划中所存在的关键问题，而且要交攻克关键，完成计划的主要措施；不仅要交工作中的有利条件，而且要交工作中可能遇到的困难。向群众“交底”以后，就要认真发动和组织群众进行深入细致的讨论，以便充分地吸取群众的智慧和经验，真正达到目标明确，关键有数，措施具体，干部和群众心中落实。要达到这些要求，根据“交底”工作做得比较好的单位的经验，一般应在“交底”过程中，抓住四个环节：第一，先摸底后交底。即在“交底”前，先大体摸清潜力的底、思想情况的底、先进与落后差异的底，这样就可以在“交底”时心中大体有数，有的放矢，同时使领导的安排大体接近实际或者符合实际。第二，“交底”和教育结合。实现跃进计划，意味着促进生产的发展，因此就要有先进的不断革命的思想基础。所以，把“交底”的过程，化为向群众进行实际生动的社会主义、共产主义教育的过程，使群众了解完成国家计划的政治意义和经济意义，完成个人计划和整个国家的关系，以提高群众的觉悟。第三，“交底”和对比结合。没有经过对比订出来的计划和措施，很难设想是先进、可靠的计划和措施。“交底”时，为了启发群众比先进、学先进、赶先进、超先进，一定要把先进和落后的对立面摆出来，并且启发群众找出先进和落后的原因。这样，实际上也就是把“交底”的工作和发动、组织群众开展比先进、学先进、赶先进、超先进的社会主义竞赛，有机地结合起来；这样，就能使计划和措施，订得又先进、又可靠，就能使职工群众发挥更大的干劲，你追我赶，后进赶先进，先进更先进。第四，“交底”和辩论结合。“交底”后，一定要在群众中进行充分辩论。实践证明：不仅思想问题应展开群众性辩论，科学技术问题也应该组织群众辩论。真理越辩越明，办法越辩越多，通过辩论不仅可以在更大范围内和更大程度上听取群众意见，集中群众智慧，使计划措施更加先进、落实，而且可以使群众的认识更加清楚，使任务、计划的完成，真正建筑在广泛的、群众自觉的基础上。
    目前，社会主义建设大跃进的新高潮正在形成，广大群众鼓起了比1958年更足的革命干劲，热情奋发地誓为完成和超额完成今年国家计划而奋斗。我们应该发扬党的民主传统，所有方针、任务和计划指标的确定和执行，一定要和群众商量，尊重群众的意见，并取得他们的同意，只要认真向群众“交底”，认真发动和组织群众进行辩论，并且畅所欲言，多面交锋，对立面就能树立，矛盾就能揭露，真理就能找到，运动就能展开，任务就能胜利完成。
