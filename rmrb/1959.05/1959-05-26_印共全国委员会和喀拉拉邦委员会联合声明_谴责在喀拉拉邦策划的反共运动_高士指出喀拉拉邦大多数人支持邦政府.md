Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, May 25th. The Secretariat of the National Council and the Secretariat of the Kerala State Committee of the Communist Party of India issued a joint statement on the 24th, condemning the anti-communist movement being planned in Kerala, and called on communist organizations everywhere to hold a "Kerala Week" starting June 7th to expose this movement.

The statement pointed out that this anti-communist movement was being launched by groups of communalists, Christian organizations, and Nair people (a Hindu caste supporting the former King's government), and that the real motive of the Congress Party in this state was "to intensify tensions and use the caste movement to achieve their own narrow political goals."

This statement was issued by the National Council and the Kerala State Committee of the Communist Party of India after a joint meeting in Trivandrum, the capital of Kerala. Some members of the Secretariat of the National Council recently went there to study new developments in the state.

After the meeting, Ajoy Ghosh, General Secretary of the Communist Party of India, told reporters that he believed that the majority of the people of Kerala supported the state government, despite the development of caste hysteria. He said that the Communist Party did not approve of any compromise on the basic principles of the Education Act, and if violent actions occurred, the state government would take all necessary measures to deal with such incitement.

According to reports, the National Leadership of the Congress Party has decided that the Congress Party organization in Kerala will not participate in the planned movement against the Education Act because the Education Act has already been approved by the President of India, but Congress Party members serving on school boards are allowed to participate in the movement against the Education Act. Ghosh pointed out that this attitude was self-contradictory.

The Kerala State Assembly passed an education bill in September 1957, stipulating improvements in teachers' lives and that the government could take over poorly managed schools and approve lists of teachers in private schools. After amendments (stipulating that schools run by Anglo-Indians and ethnic minorities were not subject to the ordinance), the bill was approved by the President of India. However, forces opposing the state government are nervously preparing to launch an anti-communist movement on June 1st, the start of the next academic year. According to "The Times of India", the Catholic Archbishop of Changanacherry in Kerala has appealed to Catholic families to participate in the movement as volunteers.

Currently, people are holding mass rallies all over the state to oppose this planned anti-communist movement. The Kerala State Teachers Association, organized by people from different political parties, has expressed support for the state government and has decided to repel this movement.

### 印共全国委员会和喀拉拉邦委员会联合声明  谴责在喀拉拉邦策划的反共运动  高士指出喀拉拉邦大多数人支持邦政府

    印共全国委员会和喀拉拉邦委员会联合声明
    谴责在喀拉拉邦策划的反共运动
    高士指出喀拉拉邦大多数人支持邦政府
    新华社新德里25日电  印度共产党全国委员会书记处和喀拉拉邦委员会书记处24日发表联合声明，谴责在喀拉拉邦内正在策划的反共运动，并且号召各地共产党组织从6月7日起举行“喀拉拉邦周”来揭露这个运动。
    声明指出，这个反共运动是一些教族分子、基督教团体和奈尔人（支持前土王政府的印度教族）的团体准备发动的，而国大党在这个邦里的真正动机是“加剧紧张状态，利用教族运动来达到他们自己狭隘的政治目的”。
    这项声明是印度共产党全国委员会和喀拉拉邦委员会在喀拉拉邦首府特里凡得琅举行了联席会议以后发表的。全国委员会书记处的一些成员最近到那里去研究了邦内新的事态发展。
    印度共产党总书记高士在会后对新闻记者发表了谈话，他表示相信，喀拉拉邦的大多数人民支持邦政府，尽管教族的歇斯底里的行动有所发展。他说，共产党不赞成在教育法的基本原则上作任何妥协，如果发生暴力行动的话，邦政府将采取一切必要的措施来对付这种煽动活动。
    据消息说，国大党的全国领导机构已经决定，喀拉拉邦的国大党组织不参与策划中的反对教育法的运动，因为教育法已经由印度总统批准，但是担任学校董事的国大党员被允许参加反对教育法的运动。高士指出，这种态度是自相矛盾的。
    喀拉拉邦议会在1957年9月通过了一项教育法案，规定改善教师生活和政府可以接办管理不善的学校和批准私立学校教员的名单等。这个法案经修改以后（规定英国籍印度人和少数民族办的学校不受这项法令约束）已由印度总统批准。但反对邦政府的势力正在紧张地准备在6月1日下一学年开始时，发动反共运动。据“印度时报”报道，喀拉拉邦昌甘纳彻里的天主教大主教已经向天主教家庭发出呼吁，要求他们作为志愿人员参加运动。
    现在，邦内各地人民正纷纷举行群众大会，反对这种策划中的反共运动。由不同政党人员组织的喀拉拉邦教师协会已经表示支持邦政府并且决定击退这个运动。
