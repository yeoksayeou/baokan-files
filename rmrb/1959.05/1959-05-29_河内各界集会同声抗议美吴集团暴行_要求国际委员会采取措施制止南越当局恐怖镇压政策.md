Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, May 27th: Over 7,000 representatives from all circles in Hanoi braved the rain tonight to hold a mass rally at the People's Theatre to protest the US-Ngo Dinh Diem clique's intensified bloody suppression of the South Vietnamese people.

    The assembly passed a resolution demanding that the International Commission take active measures to force the South Vietnamese authorities to immediately cease their policy of terrorist suppression and immediately revoke Decree No. 10 of 1959. Throughout the assembly, the masses present indignantly shouted slogans, condemning the US imperialists and the Ngo Dinh Diem group for massacring South Vietnamese patriots and supporting the heroic struggle of the South Vietnamese people.

    Duong Bach Mai, Standing Committee member of the Central Committee of the Vietnam Fatherland Front, said at the assembly that the flames of anger ignited among the people by the Phu Loi massacre had not yet subsided when the US-Ngo Dinh Diem clique launched large-scale mopping-up operations in "War Zone D" and many other places, and recently promulgated the fascist Decree No. 10 of 1959. He said that no matter how cruel the suppression by the US-Ngo Dinh Diem clique may be, the South Vietnamese people will surely defeat them, and final victory will surely belong to the people.

    Bui Ky Xuan, member of the Presidium of the Central Committee of the Vietnam Fatherland Front, read out the letter to the entire people issued by the Central Committee of the Fatherland Front regarding the situation in South Vietnam. The message supported the heroic struggle of the South Vietnamese people against the brutal policies of the US-Ngo Dinh Diem regime and called on the people of North Vietnam to step up the construction of socialist North Vietnam as a solid foundation for the unification of the motherland. The message also called on people of peace and justice in the world to continue to support the struggle of the Vietnamese people and stop the conspiracy of the US-Ngo Dinh Diem clique to provoke war.
