    The socialist countries celebrated the tenth anniversary of the establishment of the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (CMEA) in April this year. A few days ago, the CMEA held its eleventh meeting in Tirana, at which a resolution on the CMEA's ten years of work was adopted. The resolution emphasized:
  "The Council for Mutual Economic Assistance, established in 1949, plays a major role in organizing the planned economic cooperation of socialist countries and in assisting and uniting forces aimed at developing socialist economies." The CMEA's outstanding work over the past decade has led to the great development of economic mutual assistance and cooperation among socialist countries, greatly strengthening the power and unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union.
    Proletarian internationalism is the clear banner of mutual relations between socialist countries. The unprecedented new type of relationship between socialist countries is based on the principles of complete equality between all countries, respect for their territorial integrity, respect for national independence and sovereignty, and non-interference in internal affairs. But this does not include all of its content. Selfless brotherly mutual assistance is an integral part of their mutual relations. This selfless brotherly mutual assistance, especially the assistance of economically developed countries to less economically developed countries, powerfully embodies the principles of proletarian internationalism.
    The Council for Mutual Economic Assistance is an organization for international economic cooperation established on the principles of proletarian internationalism. The countries participating in this organization are Albania, Bulgaria, Hungary, the German Democratic Republic, Poland, Romania, the Soviet Union, and Czechoslovakia. Although Vietnam, China, Korea, and Mongolia are not members of this organization, as members of the socialist family, they also participate equally in the economic cooperation of socialist countries, and their representatives regularly attend meetings of the CMEA and its various institutions as observers.
    For ten years, the CMEA member states have been developing fraternal economic cooperation through the coordination of economic plans, equal and mutually beneficial trade, the provision of concessional loans, various enterprise equipment and technical assistance by economically developed countries to other fraternal countries, the exchange of scientific and technological and production experience, and the provision of free economic assistance. When the socialist countries experienced an unprecedented economic upsurge and countries began to formulate long-term development plans, how to better develop the superiority of socialist international division of labor became an important issue. Production specialization and collaboration among socialist countries is an advanced form of socialist international division of labor, marking a new stage in the economic cooperation of socialist countries. This international division of labor is mainly achieved through the coordination of national economic development plans of socialist countries. The coordination of national economic development plans of socialist countries will ensure the most rational use of natural resources and economic potential in each country. This will strengthen the economic power of the entire socialist camp and harmoniously combine the national interests of each socialist country with the interests of the entire socialist camp. At present, socialist countries are coordinating national economic development plans before 1965, and by 1960, the first common long-term plan before 1975 will be formulated.
    From 1955, the task of solving the specialization and collaboration of production in socialist countries was gradually formulated at the meetings of the CMEA. The Seventh Meeting of the CMEA held in Berlin in 1956 adopted recommendations on the long-term coordination of the development of major sectors of the national economy of member states from 1956 to 1960, and formulated specific measures to expand production specialization and ensure further technological improvement. The Eighth Meeting of the CMEA held in Warsaw in 1957 also proposed the issue of cooperation among member states in the long-term development plans of major sectors of the national economy in ten or fifteen years. The Meeting of Representatives of Communist and Workers' Parties of CMEA Member States held in Moscow in May 1958 put forward important proposals for further developing economic cooperation among member states on the basis of international division of labor, rational arrangement of production specialization and collaboration in socialist countries. This meeting was a new sign of economic mutual assistance and cooperation among countries in the socialist camp.
    In the year after the Moscow meeting, the CMEA held three more meetings to continue discussing the specialization and collaboration of member states in the development plans of the national economy. This eleventh meeting also discussed the issue of further expanding the economic cooperation between member states and the Eastern socialist countries—China, Vietnam, Korea, and Mongolia. This shows that the economic cooperation of socialist countries will be further expanded and developed to a higher stage.
    The development of economic mutual assistance and cooperation among socialist countries has enabled some countries to change their original economically backward appearances and gradually improve to the level of advanced countries. In this regard, the Soviet Union, the most powerful and experienced first socialist country, has played a very significant role in providing selfless assistance to other fraternal countries in many ways. Since the Second World War, the Soviet Union has provided other fraternal countries with loans totaling more than 28 billion rubles. From 1946 to 1958, with the help of the Soviet Union, other socialist countries have built and are building more than 600 enterprises, workshops, and individual installations, most of which have been put into production. Now, when socialist economic cooperation has developed to an advanced stage, the role of the Soviet Union has been greatly enhanced. The iron sand supplied by the Soviet Union plays a decisive role in the growth of pig iron production in other socialist countries. The Soviet Union also provides other socialist countries with most of the most important raw materials they need. For example, in 1957, the percentage of raw materials in the Soviet Union's exports to CMEA member states was: oil 99.5%, iron ore 79.2%, manganese ore 97.6%, copper 75.6%, steel 57.5%, cotton 67.7%.
    After the implementation of production specialization, other socialist countries also occupy a clear position in the socialist international division of labor. For example, Poland supplies other socialist countries with coal, non-ferrous metals, chemicals, and machinery; the German Democratic Republic supplies machinery and chemicals; Czechoslovakia supplies machinery, light industrial products, and certain raw materials, especially coke and coking coal; Hungary supplies machinery, grain and agricultural raw materials, bauxite and aluminum; Romania supplies oil and oil products; Bulgaria supplies non-ferrous metals, grain and agricultural products, light industrial products, and various machines; Albania also participates in an increasingly wide range of division of labor.
    The economic mutual assistance and cooperation of socialist countries has achieved great success. This mutual assistance and cooperation has accelerated the economic development of socialist countries and shortened the time for countries in the socialist camp to achieve final victory in the peaceful economic competition with capitalism. In the past ten years, the industry of CMEA member states has undergone tremendous development. Compared with 1949, the industrial output of various countries in 1958 increased by: 3.5 times in Albania, 1.9 times in Bulgaria, 1.3 times in Hungary, 1.4 times in the German Democratic Republic, 1.8 times in Poland, 1.7 times in Romania, 1.5 times in the Soviet Union, and 1.3 times in Czechoslovakia. During the same period, China's industrial output also increased by about six times, Korea increased by three times, Mongolia increased by one time, and Vietnam's industrial production has also increased by 3.6 times in the past three years. In the past five years, the average growth rate of industrial output value of the entire socialist camp was 11%, while the entire capitalist world was less than 3%. Comrade Khrushchev pointed out at the 21st Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union: "International division of labor, especially the advanced forms of this division, namely specialization and collaboration, will play a huge role in the economic development of the socialist camp. This provides new and more possibilities for the entire socialist camp and every socialist country to develop production. If any country works alone, it is impossible to have such a vigorous development speed as the socialist country system." At present, the industrial output of the entire socialist camp accounts for more than one-third of the world's total industrial output; the completion and over-fulfillment of the Soviet Union's seven-year plan, as well as the high-speed economic development of socialist countries, will enable the industrial production of socialist camp countries to reach more than half of the world's industrial output. By that time, the world socialist system will also have an advantage over the world capitalist system in terms of material production.
    Comrade Khrushchev put forward the famous thesis at the 21st Congress of the CPSU that socialist countries will transition to communist society at roughly the same time, giving great encouragement to the people of all countries in the socialist camp. The basis of this thesis is the law of economic development under the socialist economic system, which is the economic mutual assistance and cooperation of socialist countries. Comrade Khrushchev pointed out: "Under the socialist economic system, the law of planned and proportional development is in effect. Therefore, economically backward countries in the past rely on the experience of other socialist countries, rely on cooperation and mutual assistance, and quickly make up for time to catch up with their economy and culture. In this way, the common level of economic and cultural development of all socialist countries is balanced."
    The implementation of economic mutual assistance and cooperation by socialist camp countries does not exclude mutually beneficial trade with other countries under the principle of peaceful coexistence. When the CMEA was established, it announced that other countries that are willing to adopt its principles and are willing to cooperate with its member states can become members of this organization. Socialist countries have always believed that the more the economic mutual assistance and cooperation of socialist countries develops, the broader the prospects for developing trade relations between the two world systems. Currently, there are broad possibilities for developing trade relations between the two world systems. From 1950 to 1953, due to the "embargo" policy implemented by the imperialist group headed by the United States, the trade relations between the two world systems were practically stagnated; from 1953 to 1957, with the easing of the international situation, the exchange of goods between the two world systems more than doubled. The total amount of exports from CMEA member states to economically underdeveloped countries in 1957 also increased by more than two times compared to 1953. The economic mutual assistance and cooperation of socialist countries has promoted the rapid economic development of socialist countries, created new conditions for conducting trade with capitalist countries and providing economic assistance to underdeveloped countries, and for strengthening the economic basis for peaceful coexistence between the two world systems.
    The Council for Mutual Economic Assistance, which fully embodies the fraternal mutual assistance and cooperation of socialist countries, has nothing in common with the "European Economic Cooperation Bureau" and other organizations with their dog-eat-dog mentality in capitalist countries. The selfless economic assistance of socialist countries to economically underdeveloped countries also has nothing in common with the so-called "assistance" provided by imperialist countries to underdeveloped countries for exploitation and enslavement. Only the Yugoslav modern revisionists who serve imperialism confuse these two completely different types of assistance, and even say that the so-called "assistance" of imperialism is better. They are deliberately beautifying imperialism and vilifying socialism. However, they cannot erase the great achievements of economic mutual assistance and cooperation among countries in the socialist camp. The outstanding work of the CMEA over the past decade not only shows that the economic mutual assistance and cooperation of socialist camp countries is constantly developing, but also shows the broader prospects for such mutual assistance and cooperation in the future.

    社会主义国家经济互助合作的巨大发展
    程光锐
    今年4月，社会主义各国庆祝了经济互助委员会成立十周年。前几天，经济互助委员会在地拉那召开了第十一次会议，会上通过了关于委员会十年工作的决议。决议中强调指出：
  “1949年建立的经济互助委员会在组织社会主义各国有计划的经济合作、在协助和联合旨在发展社会主义经济的力量方面起着重大的作用。”经济互助委员会在过去十年中的卓越的工作，使社会主义国家经济互助合作获得了巨大的发展，大大加强了以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的威力和团结。
    无产阶级国际主义是社会主义国家间的相互关系的鲜明旗帜。社会主义国家间史无前例的新型关系，是建立在各个国家的完全平等、尊重领土完整、尊重国家的独立和主权、互不干涉内政的原则上的。但是，这还没有包括它的全部内容。而无私的兄弟互助，是它们之间相互关系的不可分割的部分。这种无私的兄弟互助，特别是经济发达的国家对经济比较不发达的国家的援助，有力地体现了无产阶级国际主义的原则。
    经济互助委员会就是在无产阶级国际主义的原则上建立的国际经济合作的组织。参加这个组织的有阿尔巴尼亚、保加利亚、匈牙利、德意志民主共和国、波兰、罗马尼亚、苏联和捷克斯洛伐克。越南、中国、朝鲜和蒙古虽然不是这个组织的成员国，但是它们作为社会主义大家庭的成员，实际上也平等地参加社会主义国家的经济合作，它们的代表都以观察员的身份经常出席经济互助委员会及其各个机构的会议。
    十年来，经济互助委员会各成员国，通过经济计划的配合，平等互利的贸易，经济发达的国家对其他兄弟国家提供优惠贷款、各种企业设备和技术援助，交流科学技术和生产经验，无偿地给予经济援助等多种多样的方式，发展着兄弟般的经济合作。当社会主义国家出现了空前的经济高涨、各国纷纷拟订发展远景计划的新情况的时候，如何更好地发展社会主义国际分工的优越性就成了重要的课题。社会主义国家生产专业化和协作是社会主义国际分工的高级形式，它标志着社会主义国家经济合作的新阶段。这种国际分工主要是通过社会主义各国国民经济发展计划的配合达到的。社会主义各国国民经济发展计划的配合，将保证每个国家最合理地利用天然富源和经济潜力。这将会加强整个社会主义阵营的经济威力，使每个社会主义国家的民族利益和整个社会主义阵营的利益和谐地结合起来。目前，社会主义各国正在协调1965年以前的国民经济发展计划，到1960年，还要制订1975年以前的第一个共同的远景计划。
    从1955年起，在经济互助委员会的会议上，就逐渐制订了解决社会主义国家生产专业化和协作的任务。1956年在柏林召开的经济互助委员会第七次会议，通过了关于成员国1956—1960年发展国民经济主要部门长期配合问题的建议，并且制订了关于扩大生产专业化和保证进一步提高技术的具体措施。1957年在华沙召开的经济互助委员会第八次会议，又提出了各成员国国民经济主要部门在十年或十五年长期发展计划方面协作的问题。1958年5月在莫斯科举行的经济互助委员会成员国共产党和工人党代表会议，对于在社会主义各国国际分工、合理安排生产专业化和协作的基础上，进一步发展各成员国之间的经济合作问题提出了重要的建议。这次会议是社会主义阵营国家经济互助合作的新的标志。
    莫斯科会议以后的一年间，经济互助委员会又召开了三次会议，继续讨论各成员国在国民经济发展计划中实行专业化和协作的问题。这次的第十一次会议并且讨论了进一步扩大各成员国同东方社会主义国家——中国、越南、朝鲜和蒙古的经济合作问题。这说明社会主义国家的经济合作将更加扩大并且向着更高的阶段发展。
    社会主义国家经济互助合作的发展，已使一些国家改变了原来的经济落后的面貌，逐渐提高到先进国家的水平。在这方面，力量最强大和经验最丰富的第一个社会主义国家苏联对其他兄弟国家多方面的无私援助起了极显著的作用。第二次世界大战以后，苏联给予其他兄弟国家的贷款已达二百八十多亿卢布。从1946年到1958年，在苏联的帮助下，其他社会主义国家已经建成和正在建设着六百多个企业、车间和个别装置，其中大部分已投入生产。现在，当社会主义经济合作发展到高级阶段的时候，苏联的作用更加大大提高了。苏联供给的铁砂，对其他社会主义国家生铁生产的增长起着决定性的作用。苏联还向其他社会主义国家提供它们需要的大部分最重要的原料，例如，1957年苏联向经济互助委员会成员国的输出中，原料所占的百分比是：石油99.5％，铁矿79.2％，锰矿97.6％，铜75.6％，钢材57.5％，棉花67.7％。
    在实行生产的专业化之后，其他社会主义国家在社会主义国际分工中，也分别占有明确的地位。例如，波兰供给其他社会主义国家煤、有色金属、化学品和机器；德意志民主共和国供给机器和化学品，捷克斯洛伐克供给机器、轻工业产品和某种原料，特别是焦炭和炼焦煤；匈牙利供给机器、粮食和农业原料、铝土矿和铝；罗马尼亚供给石油和石油产品；保加利亚供给有色金属、粮食和农产品、轻工业产品和各种机器；阿尔巴尼亚也参加了范围越来越广的分工。
    社会主义国家的经济互助合作，已经取得了巨大的成就。这种互助合作加速了社会主义国家经济的发展，缩短了社会主义阵营各国在同资本主义进行和平经济竞赛中取得最后胜利的时间。在过去十年中，经济互助委员会成员国的工业有了巨大的发展。1958年各国工业产量同1949年相比：阿尔巴尼亚增加了三点五倍，保加利亚增加了一点九倍，匈牙利增加了一点三倍，德意志民主共和国增加了一点四倍，波兰增加了一点八倍，罗马尼亚增加了一点七倍，苏联增加了一点五倍，捷克斯洛伐克增加了一点三倍。在同一时期，中国的工业产量也增加了大约六倍，朝鲜增加了三倍，蒙古增加了一倍，越南在近三年来工业生产也提高了三点六倍。近五年来，整个社会主义阵营的工业产值平均增长率为11％，而整个资本主义世界还不到3％。赫鲁晓夫同志在苏联共产党第二十一次代表大会上指出：“国际分工，特别是这种分工的高级形式，即专业化和协作，将在社会主义阵营的经济发展方面起巨大的作用。这样就为整个社会主义阵营和每一个社会主义国家提供了新的、更多的可能来发展生产。如果单干，任何一个国家都不可能有像社会主义国家体系这样蓬勃发展的速度。”目前，整个社会主义阵营的工业产量已占全世界工业总产量的三分之一以上；苏联七年计划的完成和超额完成，以及社会主义国家经济的高速度发展，将使社会主义阵营各国的工业生产量达到全世界工业产量的一半以上。到那时候，世界社会主义体系在物质生产方面也将比世界资本主义体系占优势了。
    赫鲁晓夫同志在苏共第二十一次代表大会上提出了社会主义国家将大致同时过渡到共产主义社会的著名论断，给予社会主义阵营各国人民以极大的鼓舞。这个论断的根据就是社会主义经济制度下的经济发展规律，就是社会主义国家经济的互助合作。赫鲁晓夫同志指出：“在社会主义经济制度下，起作用的是有计划、按比例发展的规律，因此，从前经济上落后的国家依靠其他社会主义国家的经验，依靠合作和互助，就迅速弥补时间，使自己的经济和文化赶上去。这样，所有社会主义国家的经济和文化发展的共同水平就平衡起来了。”
    社会主义阵营国家实行经济互助合作，并不排斥同其他国家在和平共处的原则下进行互利的贸易。经济互助委员会在一成立时就曾公布，凡愿采纳它的原则并愿同它的会员国合作的其他国家，都可以成为这个组织的成员，社会主义国家一向认为，社会主义国家经济互助合作越发展，两个世界体系之间发展贸易关系的前途就越广阔。目前存在着发展两个世界体系之间的贸易关系的广泛的可能性。1950年到1953年间，由于以美国为首的帝国主义集团实行“禁运”政策，两个世界体系之间的贸易关系实际上陷于停滞；在1953年到1957年，随着国际形势的趋于缓和，两个世界体系之间的商品交换增加了一倍以上。经济互助委员会成员国向经济不发达国家的输出总额，1957年也比1953年增加了两倍以上。社会主义国家经济互助合作，促进了社会主义国家经济的迅速发展，为同资本主义国家进行贸易和在经济上援助不发达国家，为加强两个世界体系和平共处的经济基础创造了新的条件。
    充分地体现了社会主义国家兄弟般互助合作的经济互助委员会，同资本主义国家勾心斗角的“欧洲经济合作局”之类的组织毫无共同之处。社会主义国家对经济不发达国家的无私的经济援助，同帝国主义国家为了剥削和奴役而对不发达国家提供的所谓“援助”也是毫无共同之处的。只有为帝国主义服务的南斯拉夫现代修正主义者，才把这两种性质完全不同的援助混同起来，甚至把帝国主义的所谓“援助”说得更好。他们存心美化帝国主义、丑化社会主义。但是，他们丝毫也不能抹煞社会主义阵营各国经济互助合作的巨大成就。经济互助委员会十年来的卓越的工作，不仅说明了社会主义阵营各国经济互助合作不断获得发展，而且展示着这种互助合作在今后更加广阔的发展前景。
