Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, 30th -- For more than a month, from March 22nd to April 30th, an Indian newspaper called "Glory" published a full thirty editorials on the Chinese Tibet rebellion. In the past six days, this pro-American Urdu newspaper has successively published six editorials cursing China.

The newspaper's editorial published today clamored that "China's attitude on the Tibet issue is completely imperialist."

The editorial insisted that the Tibetan rebellion occurred "without being influenced by any foreign country, and India did not participate in it," and therefore, "the Chinese government's opposition to India's claims is unfounded." However, it kept silent about all the words and deeds of Indian expansionists.

The newspaper's editorial on the 29th slandered China for conducting "vicious anti-Indian propaganda" and insisted on describing the rebellion launched by the Tibetan upper-class reactionary group as a manifestation of "nationalist sentiment." Its editorial on the 28th accused China of launching "open psychological warfare" against India, saying that China hoped that "India would return the Dalai Lama to China; let Tibet be at the mercy of the greedy Han communists, instead of expressing support for Tibetan autonomy." The editorial on the 27th maliciously stated that "China's unfounded and malicious propaganda aims to make us allow the greedy Han communists to control our neighboring Tibet; to make us close our eyes and let them massacre."

The editorial on the 26th further revealed the fox tail of the expansionists, complaining that India's "recognition of China's ruling position over Tibet in 1951 was a mistake," and that "when China attacked Tibet, although we (India) had our rights in Tibet, we quietly withdrew from there." The title of the editorial on the 25th was "Break with China." This editorial even described the Panchen Erdeni's speech at the National People's Congress as part of the Chinese government's "blackmail aimed at suppressing the voices of India protesting against China's oppressive behavior."

Among these thirty editorials, some of the titles are startling, such as: "New Imperialists in the Far East," "China's Ranting," "Following in Goebbels' Footsteps"...

The newspaper also added such an astonishing headline to a news item on March 28: "Tibet Declares Independence - The United States Has Never Recognized the Agreement Between Tibet and China."

### 一个多月来几乎天天咒骂我国  印度“荣耀报”以攻击我国为荣耀

    一个多月来几乎天天咒骂我国
    印度“荣耀报”以攻击我国为荣耀
    新华社新德里30日电　从3月22日到4月30日这一个多月的时间内，印度有一家报纸叫“荣耀报”，曾经就中国西藏叛乱事件发表了整整三十篇社论。在过去六天内，这家亲美的乌尔都文报纸接连发表了六篇咒骂中国的社论。
    这家报纸今天发表的社论叫嚷说：“中国在西藏问题上所采取的态度完全是帝国主义的态度。”
    这篇社论硬说西藏叛乱的发生“并没有受任何外国的影响，印度没有参与其事”，“因此，中国政府反对印度的说法是没有根据的”。但是它闭口不谈印度扩张主义者的一切言行。
    这家报纸在29日发表的社论污蔑中国进行“恶毒的反对印度的宣传”，并且硬把西藏上层反动集团发动的叛乱说成是“民族主义情绪”的表现。它的28日的社论诬蔑中国向印度“公开发动神经战”，说什么中国希望“印度把达赖喇嘛交还给中国；让西藏听任共产党贪心汉的摆布，而不去表示赞成西藏自治”。27日的社论恶意地说，“中国的毫无根据的和恶毒的宣传，目的是想使我们听任共产党贪心汉去摆布我们的邻国西藏；使我们闭上眼睛让他们去屠杀。”
    26日的社论更进一步露出了扩张主义者的狐狸尾巴，它抱怨说，印度“在1951年承认中国对西藏的统治地位是一种错误”，“当中国进攻西藏时，虽然我们（印度）在西藏有着我们的权利，但是我们安静地从那里撤了出来。”25日社论的题目是“同中国决裂”，这篇社论竟然把班禅额尔德尼在全国人民代表大会会议上的发言说成是中国政府“为了压制印度发出的抗议中国压迫行为的声音而进行的敲榨勒索活动的一部分”。
    在这三十篇社论中，有一些社论的题目是令人吃惊的，例如：“远东的新帝国主义者”，“中国的狂叫”，“步戈培尔的后尘”……。
    这家报纸还在3月28日的一条消息上加上这样的令人诧异的标题：“西藏宣布独立——美国从未承认西藏和中国的协议”。
