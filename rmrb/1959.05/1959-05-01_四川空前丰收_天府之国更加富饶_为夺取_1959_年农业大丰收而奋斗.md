Speech by Representative Li Dazhang

    Chairman, fellow representatives:
    I fully agree with Premier Zhou Enlai's government work report and the reports by Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and I am willing to resolutely implement them in future work.

    The Tibetan Rebel Group Was the Mastermind and Commander of the Rebellion in Garze Prefecture, Sichuan Province

    Now, I will first talk about the Tibet issue. Premier Zhou pointed out in the government work report: "The armed rebellion launched by the former Tibetan local government and the upper-class reactionary clique to betray the motherland and undermine unification has suffered a shameful defeat. The government has ordered the dissolution of the former Tibetan local government (i.e., the Kashag), and the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region will exercise the functions and powers of the local government, so that Tibet can quickly achieve national regional autonomy and gradually carry out democratic reforms." We fully support and endorse this very timely and completely correct major measure taken by the government on the Tibet issue. It should be pointed out that the upper-class reactionary clique in Tibet has been plotting to launch an armed rebellion for a long time. The bandit unrest that occurred in Garze Prefecture, Sichuan Province, and has been quelled, was the result of secret activities and specific instructions and arrangements by upper-class reactionary elements in Tibet, namely Chijiang Luosang Yexi and Chupu Garmaba, Ribei Duoji, etc., after attending the First Session of the First National People's Congress in 1954 and passing through Garze on their way back to Tibet in the spring and summer of 1955. During the rebellion in Garze Prefecture, they used the guise of protecting religion and safeguarding national interests to deceive the people, and used the central government's decision to postpone reforms in Tibet for six years to demand that other Tibetan areas outside Tibet should also not be reformed, and openly put forward the slogan of expelling Han people and never reforming. Some of the weapons used by the rebels were also supplied by the upper-class reactionary clique in Tibet.

    All of the above eloquently proves that the Tibetan rebel group was the mastermind and commander of the rebellion in Garze Prefecture of our province.

    The Tibetan rebel group instructed the upper-class reactionary elements in Garze Prefecture to launch a rebellion, with the aim of using the Tibetan areas on the periphery of Tibet as the front line to cover the drive for independence in Tibet proper, thereby preserving Tibet's backward, dark, reactionary, cruel, and barbaric serf system, in order to continue to serve the expansionist of India and the aggression of its background boss, British imperialism. However, the calculations of these reactionary elements were completely wrong. The rebellion in Garze Prefecture has been quelled, and similarly, the armed rebellion launched by the upper-class reactionary elements in Tibet this time has also suffered a shameful defeat. We fully believe that the Tibetan people will be able to fully realize their aspiration for national regional autonomy in the future, and with the mutual support of all ethnic groups in the country, they will surely build the Tibetan Plateau into a true paradise on earth.

    Last Year, Sichuan's Agricultural Production Achieved an Unprecedented Bumper Harvest. Deeply Summarize Last Year's Experience to Ensure Continued Leap Forward This Year.

    Now I will talk about the agricultural production in our province.

    In 1958, with the correct leadership of the Party and the hard work of all farmers, our province's agricultural production achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest. The total grain output of the province reached 90 billion jin, an increase of 94 percent over 1957, ahead of schedule and exceeding the targets set by the National Agricultural Development Program (Revised Draft). The total cotton output reached 2.5 million dan, an increase of 79 percent over 1957, and the total number of live pigs reached 32 million, an increase of 28 percent over 1957. It is worth mentioning that in 1958, not only did some high-yield satellite fields appear in grain production, but also some larger areas of high-yield fields appeared; not only did all kinds of crops increase in production across the board, but also different areas such as plains, hills, and mountains achieved different degrees of increase in production. The grain output of 74 counties (cities) in the province averaged 1,000 jin or more per mu, of which 25 counties (cities) had reached or exceeded 1,500 jin. The indisputable fact of the great leap forward in agricultural production in 1958 not only powerfully shattered the fallacy that agriculture cannot develop at a high speed, but more importantly, further liberated people's minds and laid a material and ideological foundation for gradually achieving large-scale high yield in the future.

    The achievements made in agricultural production in 1958 were tremendous, but in terms of people's needs, especially fine grains in food and cotton and oil crops in cash crops, they are far from being met. Therefore, according to the state's allocation of 126 billion jin of grain and 4 million dan of cotton to our province in 1959, we must guarantee and strive to over fulfill them. The increase in the above two indicators of grain and cotton will reach or exceed the 40 percent growth requirement put forward by Premier Zhou in the government work report. Judging from the projected target for grain increase, the total grain output in 1959 will increase by 36 billion jin compared with 90 billion jin in 1958, and the increase of 36 billion jin is 2.7 billion jin more than the total grain output of 33.3 billion jin in the bumper year of 1952 (1952). It can be seen that this year's agricultural production target in our province is obviously a great leap forward target, and it is not easy to complete without a solid and hard struggle.

    When proposing and formulating the above indicators, some of our comrades did not have completely consistent ideological understanding. Some comrades believe that this year's grain increase is small and can be completed without much effort. Others believe that this year's grain increase target is high, there are many difficulties, and it is not easy to complete. Although the above two ideological situations are expressed in different forms, the results will affect the completion of this year's grain increase task. The problem is very obvious, if these ideological problems are not solved, it is impossible to strive for a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward on this year's agricultural front. According to the spirit of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party, our province has tightly grasped the important link of solving the ideological problems of cadres first from the four-level cadre meeting held in December last year and subsequent meetings, using the method of presenting facts, calculating detailed accounts, and holding on-site meetings, through summarizing the experience of the great leap forward in 1958, fully affirming last year's achievements, emphasizing that we must continue to exert great efforts and strive for the upstream in this year's agricultural production, at the same time, objectively analyze and point out the various favorable conditions for realizing the agricultural increase task in 1959, especially pointing out that since recently, after the people's communes have been reorganized and consolidated, various systems and organizations have become more sound, which is an even more favorable condition for further mobilizing and giving play to the production enthusiasm of the vast number of commune members, and guaranteeing the completion of the agricultural increase task in 1959. Through the above ideological education work, the level of understanding of cadres has been greatly improved, and the slackness, complacency, and fear of difficulties in the minds of some cadres have been basically resolved, and the confidence in completing the agricultural production task in 1959 has been established and enhanced.

    Vigorously Improve Leadership Methods, Promptly Commend Advanced Models, Organize Appraisals and Competitions, and Encourage the Morale of the Masses.

    While solving the ideological problems of cadres, the Sichuan Provincial Party Committee, based on the main experience of the great leap forward in 1958, promptly put forward the idea of "grasping tightly from the beginning and grasping tightly from beginning to end" in leadership methods, and specifically proposed to apply the following five main experiences that have been mastered and used by the majority of cadres in last year's production practice: strengthen the Party's leadership and put politics in command; mobilize the masses to discuss production targets and make the targets mastered by the masses; carry out red flag competitions, promptly commend advanced models, organize appraisals and inspections, hold on-site meetings, and quickly promote effective advanced experiences; cadres participate in labor and engage in large-scale experimental fields, command fields, etc., and systematically summarize and promote them to educate the vast number of cadres, and skillfully master and apply these experiences in the practice of striving for a greater leap forward in agriculture this year, so as to lead the 1959 agricultural production movement better, develop it healthily, and finally achieve a comprehensive victory.

    After the provincial Party committee's instructions were promptly implemented, they have already shown their remarkable effect on the spring crop production. This year's wheat production in our province, because it was grasped early, grasped tightly, and measures were timely, a bumper harvest is very promising. The large-scale planting of wheat, in terms of Sichuan's historical habits, was rare in the past. In the past, the wheat planted in Sichuan was generally cultivated extensively and planted in a scattered manner. After liberation, although this situation has changed greatly, it was not until the winter and spring of this year that the "Eight-Character Constitution" for agriculture was truly promoted for wheat production like rice, with deep plowing and dense planting, and large-scale fertilization. This is an important reason why a bumper harvest can be achieved in this year's spring crop. Now, the Xichang area, where the season is earlier, has begun to harvest wheat. The wheat along the Yangtze River and Tuojiang River in southern Sichuan has begun to turn yellow and will soon be harvested. The wheat in western and northern Sichuan is blooming and filling. Other spring crops are also growing more vigorously and richly than in previous years. But at this time, some cadres relaxed field management, thinking that the spring crop harvest was a foregone conclusion and could be obtained without effort. We promptly criticized this blindly optimistic thinking, emphasizing that we must continue to strengthen the late-stage field management of spring crops, timely water and topdressing fertilizer, prevent and control diseases and insect pests, and prevent lodging, etc., and strive for spring crops to have long and large ears with many and full grains, and achieve a comprehensive bumper harvest. According to the current situation, if there are no unexpected disasters, a large spring crop harvest is relatively guaranteed. According to preliminary yield estimates, it is possible that the total spring grain output in our province this year will double on the basis of 8.6 billion jin last year (4.2 billion jin of wheat) (of which wheat output will increase by about one and a half times). The scene of a promising harvest in the spring crop this year has greatly boosted people's fighting will and has laid a favorable material and ideological foundation for the major spring production.

    Achieve All-Round Increase in Production of Major Spring Crops and Gradually Implement Large-Scale Deep Plowing and Fine Cultivation

    If striving for a spring harvest is the first important battle on the agricultural production front and requires great effort, then striving for an all-round increase in the production of major spring crops has strategic significance that determines the overall situation and requires even greater effort. The fundamental way to achieve an all-round increase in the production of major spring crops is to gradually implement large-scale deep plowing and fine cultivation and high yield and multiple harvests, and to launch a large-scale high-yield movement for various crops. To this end, the Provincial Party Committee issued instructions in November last year, calling for the development of a large-scale high-yield movement. The people's communes throughout the province warmly responded to the Party's call, and adjusted the planting zoning according to the different conditions of each commune, adopting methods suitable to local conditions. Generally, a group of drought- and flood-resistant, flat, and fertile dam fields, ditch fields, and slopes were selected as high-yield areas for deep plowing and fine cultivation, and concentrated and continuous operation. For a small number of mountain slopes with bad land, measures such as transporting soil, merging soil, and thickening the soil layer were taken to gradually change the old cultivation methods of shallow plowing and extensive cultivation with low yields. Through several months of production practice, the vast number of cadres and the masses have a relatively deep understanding of large-scale high yield, and can generally consciously promote it in production activities. That is to say, we have had a good start in implementing large-scale deep plowing and fine cultivation and high yield and multiple harvests.

    To implement large-scale deep plowing and fine cultivation and high yield and multiple harvests, the first thing to do at present is to launch a mass movement for large-scale high yield. To carry out mass movement on the agricultural production front is an important way to ensure increased agricultural production. The vast number of farmers in our province, like the farmers throughout the country, have greatly improved their socialist consciousness through the education of the people's commune movement, especially the fact that agricultural bumper harvests in 1958 have strengthened their confidence in the certain victory of building socialism. They trust the leadership of the Party even more, and wherever the Party points, they go there. They are full of confidence in realizing the future happy prospects, have a strong desire to continue to leap forward and consolidate the commune system, and they have never believed as now that they are fully capable of conquering nature and can rapidly develop production. Therefore, when our province proposed to carry out a large-scale high-yield movement, it quickly received a warm response from the masses, and gradually enriched and concretized the content of this movement, forming a competition movement on 10 million mu of land to strive for 10,000 jin of grain per mu. Now this movement is continuing to move forward. It not only directly promotes the current spring crop production, but also powerfully promotes the rapid progress of sowing, rice transplanting, and other work for major spring crops, and gradually creates extremely favorable conditions for realizing large-scale deep plowing and fine cultivation and high yield and multiple harvests.

    Grain Crops and Cash Crops Must Be Developed in an All-Round Way

    In order to realize an all-round leap forward on the agricultural front in 1959, we have especially emphasized that grain crops and cash crops must be developed in an all-round way during the spring plowing and sowing period. Because during the spring plowing production period, some areas had a situation where the sowing of cash crops progressed slowly. Although there are many reasons for this situation, it is mainly related to the fact that some people only pay attention to the increase in grain production and ignore the production of cash crops. If this kind of thinking is not overcome in a timely manner, it may affect the completion of this year's cash crop production tasks. In addition, in some areas, in order to expand the area of cash crops and strive for a large grain harvest, the situation of intentionally or unintentionally squeezing out small grains and local specialty products also exists. In order to reverse this situation in a timely manner, we proposed that grain crops and cash crops should be given equal importance, arranged in an all-round way, and managed with emphasis. At the same time, the methods of fixing the area of grain and cash crops, fixing the labor force to specialize in the management of cash crops, and adopting the methods of increasing the yield per unit area and contracting work and production are used to ensure the completion of the grain increase task and the sown area of cash crops. In order to actively develop small grains and local specialty products, the Provincial Party Committee recently launched a movement for each person in the province to plant 100 jin of small grains, and clearly stipulated that the harvest of this small grain belongs entirely to the commune members. In short, our requirement is to grasp both grain and cash crops, small grains, and local specialty products; to grasp both satellite fields and large-area high-yield fields. This is a leadership method of grasping the key point to drive the general. Emphasizing this method in leading agricultural production at present has extremely important significance.

    In order to strive for an all-round bumper harvest in agricultural production in 1959, in addition to formulating practical and feasible production targets, fully doing a good job in political and ideological work, and launching mass movements for large-scale high-yield competitions, it is also necessary to systematically implement the "Eight-Character Constitution" for agricultural production. According to the specific situation and natural conditions of our province, we especially emphasize the following points in terms of major spring production:

    (1) Deep plowing of the land. After the autumn harvest movement last year, we launched a mass movement for deep plowing of the land. Except for a small number of areas where the deep plowing was 1.5 feet deep, most of the land was deeply plowed to about 1 foot. For the land that was not deeply plowed last year, it is required to continue to be deeply plowed this year. Generally, the fields are required to be deeply plowed to about 1 foot, and high-yield fields are deeply plowed to 1.5 feet, and it is required to be leveled, harrowed, and finely cultivated.

    (2) Accumulating and creating fertilizer. The three main links in the current accumulation and creation of fertilizer are to broaden the sources of fertilizer, improve fertilizer efficiency, and quickly transport fertilizer to the fields. Under the current situation of tight labor, insufficient transportation tools, and urgent need for base fertilizer in the spring, we have adopted the policy of adapting to local conditions, taking materials locally, and accumulating fertilizer locally, and are engaged in various types of smoke-fumigated fertilizer, kiln fertilizer, and red stone bone fertilizer according to different situations. The characteristics of these fertilizers are: easy to obtain materials, simple to manufacture, convenient to transport, and relatively high fertilizer efficiency. In order to encourage the enthusiasm of the broad masses to accumulate human and animal manure, we stipulate that the management area or production team should give a certain price for the use of private toilet fertilizer. Now, most areas of our province have entered the busy season of sowing and rice transplanting. In areas where the arrangements for agricultural work are not good, the work of accumulating and creating fertilizer has stopped, but in areas where the arrangements are good, the method of concentrating labor to carry out a shock accumulation of fertilizer and massively composting green manure in paddy fields is still used to accumulate and create a large amount of fertilizer. Some areas use local special soil well salt and sulfur slag and other raw materials to manufacture a lot of high-efficiency indigenous chemical fertilizers. All these methods are worth vigorously promoting.

    (3) Promoting dense planting. After summarizing the experience of the great leap forward in 1958, especially the large-scale high yield of wheat this year, most areas in our province have confidence in dense planting. However, among a part of farmers and cadres, the idea of dense planting is not solid enough, and they still have different degrees of doubt and concern. Therefore, in continuing to promote dense planting, these ideological problems must be patiently resolved. According to recent understanding, in places where the production targets and dense planting specifications are handed over to the masses, and the masses are mobilized to speak out and fully discuss them in conjunction with visits, accounting, and recalling comparisons, the ideological problems are better resolved, and dense planting is easier to promote. Conversely, it will form resistance, and promotion will not open up and stagnate. The promotion of dense planting must pay attention to adapting to local conditions and actively carrying it out. At the same time, it is necessary to consider the degree of deep plowing, the amount of base fertilizer and topdressing fertilizer, and the water source and soil quality, etc., and cannot force uniformity.

    (4) Properly arrange the labor force. During the spring plowing production period, 75 to 80 percent of the main labor force in rural areas must be invested in the front line of agricultural production. In order to achieve this goal, we have adopted the following five methods: (1) Appropriately compress some seasonal and non-urgent commune-run industries; compress too much labor force occupied by diversified operations, living welfare, and livestock breeding; at the same time, reduce the number of full-time administrative cadres as much as possible so that they can directly participate in production; (2) For those basic construction projects that should be temporarily stopped, they must be resolutely stopped temporarily; (3) Students in agricultural middle schools and other commune-run schools must implement the policy of half-day labor production and half-day study, and classes can also be suspended for a short period of time when necessary; resolutely abolish full-time art troupes and sports teams in the commune; resolutely stop the blind outflow of labor force; (4) During the busy farming season, if some elderly people and children voluntarily participate in some labor that they can do, the method of awarding wages can be adopted to encourage them; (5) Mobilize urban residents who can be mobilized to support agricultural production. In Premier Zhou's government work report, it was pointed out that:
  "The fundamental way to solve the shortage of rural labor force is to improve the labor productivity of agriculture, to gradually realize technical innovation and technical revolution, and to gradually realize the semi-mechanization and mechanization of agricultural tools." During this period, we focused on grasping the manufacturing work of several major tools required for transportation and spring plowing and summer harvesting, such as rice transplanting, harvesting, and threshing, and at the same time continued to engage in the "three-five" movement on a large scale, and rushed to repair and manufacture various small agricultural tools.

    The agricultural production task of Sichuan Province in 1959 is arduous and glorious. We have many favorable conditions for completing the task, and we have also done a lot of work. However, in order to finally complete and strive to over fulfill this task, we still need to make the greatest efforts. Recently, the leaders at all levels of our province, according to the deployment of the Sichuan Provincial Party Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, have been going to the agricultural production front to participate in labor and command battles at the same time. A large-scale mass movement of plowing fields, accumulating fertilizer, sowing seeds, and transplanting rice is flourishing. It is fully foreseeable that as long as we closely rely on the leadership of the Party, continue to mobilize the masses, follow the mass line well, and under the leadership of the Party Central Committee, Chairman Mao, and the State Council, we will surely achieve a victory even greater than in 1958.

    四川空前丰收　天府之国更加富饶
    为夺取1959年农业大丰收而奋斗
    李大章代表的发言主席、各位代表：
    我完全同意周恩来总理的政府工作报告和李富春、李先念副总理、彭真副委员长的报告，并愿在今后工作中坚决贯彻执行。
    西藏叛乱集团是四川省甘孜地区叛乱的策划者和指挥者
    现在，我首先讲一讲西藏问题。周总理在政府工作报告中指出：“原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团所发动的背叛祖国，破坏统一的武装叛乱，已经遭到可耻的失败。政府已经命令解散原西藏地方政府（即噶厦），由西藏自治区筹备委员会行使地方政府职权，使西藏迅速实现民族地方自治和逐步进行民主改革”。我们完全拥护和支持政府对西藏问题所采取的这一十分及时和完全正确的重大措施。应当指出，西藏上层反动集团阴谋发动武装叛乱是蓄谋已久的。四川甘孜地区所发生的并且已经被平息了的叛匪骚乱，就是在一九五五年春夏，西藏上层反动分子，即现在已叛国的赤江·罗桑益西和楚普噶玛巴、日贝多吉等在出席一九五四年第一届第一次全国人民代表大会后返藏道经甘孜的时候，即分头阴谋活动和具体指使部署的结果。在甘孜地区的叛乱期中，他们竟利用保护宗教、维护民族利益作幌子来欺骗人民群众，竟利用中央允许西藏六年暂不改革的决定，要求西藏以外的其他藏族地区也不改革，并公开提出驱逐汉人，永不改革的口号。叛乱分子所使用的一部分武器，也是由西藏上层反动集团供给的。
    以上所有这一切，都雄辩的证明：西藏叛乱集团是我省甘孜地区叛乱的策划者和指挥者。
    西藏叛乱集团指示甘孜地区上层反动分子进行叛乱，其目的是企图以西藏外围藏族地区为前线，掩护西藏本区的驱汉独立，从而保存西藏落后的、黑暗的、反动的、残酷的、野蛮的农奴制度，以便继续为印度的扩张主义者，及其后台老板的英帝国主义的侵略服务。但是，这些反动分子的算盘完全打错了。甘孜地区的叛乱已被平息，同样，西藏上层反动分子此次所发动的武装叛乱，也已遭到了可耻的失败。我们完全相信，西藏人民今后一定能够完全实现民族区域自治的愿望，在全国各族人民的互相支援下，他们一定会把西藏高原建成一个真正的人间乐园。
    去年，四川农业生产获得史无前例的大丰收，深入总结去年经验，保证今年继续跃进
    下面我再讲一讲我省的农业生产问题。
    我省一九五八年的农业生产，在党的正确领导和全体农民的辛勤努力下，获得了史无前例的大丰收。全省粮食总产量达到九百亿斤，比一九五七年增长百分之九十四，提前并超额实现了全国农业发展纲要（修正草案）所规定的指标。棉花总产量达到二百五十万担，比一九五七年增产百分之七十九，生猪的总头数达到三千二百万头，比一九五七年增长百分之二十八。值得特别提出的是，一九五八年的粮食生产，不仅出现了部分高产卫星田，而且也出现了部分面积较大的丰产田；不仅各种作物得到全面增产，而且平坝、丘陵、山区等不同地区也都获得了程度不同的增产。全省七十四个县
  （市）的粮食产量，平均每亩达到一千斤到一千斤以上，其中有二十五个县（市）已经达到或超过了一千五百斤。去年农业生产的大跃进这个无可置辩的事实，不仅有力地粉碎了农业不能高速度发展的谬论，而且更重要的是进一步解放了人们的思想，为今后逐步实现大面积丰产奠定了物质和思想基础。
    一九五八年的农业生产所取得的成绩是巨大的，但从人民的需要，特别是粮食中的细粮和经济作物中的棉花、油料来讲，则还远远不能满足。因此，根据一九五九年国家分配给我省粮食一千二百六十亿斤，棉花四百万担的任务，我们都必须保证和争取超额完成。上述粮、棉两项指标的增产幅度，都达到或超过了周总理在政府工作报告中所提出的增长百分之四十的要求。从粮食增产预计指标来看，一九五九年比一九五八年粮食总产量九百亿斤净增三百六十亿斤，而增产的这三百六十亿斤，比丰收的一九五二年粮食总产量还要多二十七亿斤（一九五二年是三百三十三亿斤）。由此可见，我省今年的农业生产指标，显然是一个大跃进指标，不经过一番踏踏实实、艰苦奋斗的过程，是不易完成的。
    在提出和制定以上指标时，我们有些同志在思想认识上并不是完全一致的。一些同志认为今年粮食增产幅度较小，不用费什么气力就可以完成。另一些同志则认为今年的粮食增产指标高，困难多，不易完成。以上两种思想情况，虽然表现的形式不同，但其结果都会影响今年粮食增产任务的完成。问题非常明显，这些思想问题不解决，要争取今年农业战线上更大更好更全面的跃进是不可能的。我省根据党的八届六中全会精神，从去年十二月召开的四级干部会议以及以后的历次会议上，都紧紧抓住了首先解决干部思想问题的这一重要环节，用摆事实、算细账和召开现场会议的办法，通过总结一九五八年大跃进的经验，充分肯定了去年的成绩，强调了在今年农业生产中必须继续鼓足干劲、力争上游，同时，实事求是地分析并指出了实现一九五九年农业增产任务的各种有利条件，特别指出了自最近以来人民公社在经过整理和巩固之后，各种制度和组织是更加健全起来了，这对进一步的调动和发挥广大社员的生产积极性，更是保证完成一九五九年农业增产任务的有利条件。通过以上的思想教育工作，大大提高了干部的认识水平，基本上解决了部分干部中松劲自满和害怕困难的思想，树立并增强了完成一九五九年农业生产任务的信心。
    大力改进领导方法，及时表扬先进，组织评比竞赛，鼓舞群众斗志
    在解决干部思想问题的同时，中共四川省委根据一九五八年大跃进的主要经验，及时提出了在领导方法上要“一开始就抓紧，自始至终都抓紧”，并具体提出要把在去年的生产实践中已为多数干部所掌握与运用的以下五个主要经验，即：加强党的领导，政治挂帅；发动群众讨论生产指标，使指标为群众所掌握；开展红旗竞赛，及时表扬先进，组织评比检查，召开现场会议，迅速推广行之有效的先进经验；干部参加劳动，大搞试验田、指挥田等，加以系统地总结推广，教育广大干部，在为争取今年农业更大跃进的实践中，熟练地掌握与运用这些经验，以便把一九五九年农业生产运动领导得更好，使它健康地向前发展，最后取得全面的胜利。
    省委的这一指示及时贯彻下去以后，已经在小春生产上显示出它的显著的作用来了。今年我省的小麦生产，由于抓得早，抓得紧，措施及时，丰收是大有希望的。大面积的种植小麦，就四川历史习惯来说，过去是少有的。过去四川所种植的小麦，一般耕作粗放，种植分散。解放后，这种情况虽有很大改变，但是，真正把小麦生产像水稻一样普遍推行农业“八字宪法”，进行深耕密植和大量施肥，还是从去冬今春才开始的。这是今年小春可获丰收的一个重要原因。现在，季节较早的西昌地区已经开始收割小麦。川南沿长江、沱江两岸的小麦已开始黄熟，即将收割，川西和川北地区的小麦正在扬花灌浆，其他小春作物也比往年长得茁壮丰实。但是就在这个时候，部分干部放松了田间管理，认为小春丰收已成定局，垂手可得了。我们及时批判了这种盲目乐观的思想，强调必须继续加强小春作物的后期田间管理，及时浇水追肥，防治病虫害，防止倒伏等，力争小春作物穗长穗大，粒多粒饱，获得全面大丰收。根据现在的情况看来，如果不发生意外灾害，小春大丰收是比较有把握的。据初步测产，今年我省小春粮食总产量在去年八十六亿斤（小麦四十二亿斤）的基础上增产一倍左右（其中小麦增产一倍半左右）是可能的。今年小春可望丰收的景象，大大鼓舞了人们的战斗意志，并已为大春生产打下了有利的物质和思想基础。
    实现大春作物全面增产，逐步实行大面积的深耕细作
    如果说争取小春丰收是农业生产战线上第一个重要战役，需要大力以赴，那么，争取大春的全面增产，就具有决定全局的战略意义，更需要加倍的努力。实现大春作物全面增产的根本办法，是必须逐步实行大面积的深耕细作和丰产多收，掀起一个各类作物的大面积丰产运动。为此，省委在去年十一月发出了指示，号召开展大面积丰产运动。全省人民公社热烈响应了党的号召，并按照各公社的不同情况，采取了因地制宜的办法调整了种植区划，一般都选择了一批旱涝保收、土地平坦、土质肥沃的坝田、沟田和坡地作为高产区，进行深耕细作，集中连片经营。对一小部分山坡坏地，采取了传土、并土和加厚土层等办法来逐步改变过去那种浅耕粗作、广种薄收的旧的耕作方法。通过几个月来的生产实践，广大干部和群众对大面积丰产已经有了比较深刻的认识，在生产活动中一般都能自觉地加以推行。这就是说，在贯彻执行大面积深耕细作、丰产多收方面，我们已经有了一个良好的开端。
    贯彻实行大面积的深耕细作、丰产多收，当前首先是要发动一个大面积丰产的群众运动。在农业生产战线上大搞群众运动，是保证农业增产的重要方法。我省广大农民，和全国农民一样，经过人民公社运动的教育，社会主义觉悟大大提高，特别是一九五八年农业大丰收的事实，更坚定了他们建设社会主义必胜的信心。他们对于党的领导是更加信任了，只要把问题交代清楚，党指向那里，他们就走向那里。他们对实现未来的幸福远景充满着信心，有着继续跃进和巩固公社制度的强烈要求，他们从来没有像现在这样相信自己完全有力量征服自然，能够迅速地发展生产。因此，当我省提出开展大面积丰产运动的时候，就很快在群众中得到了热烈的响应，并逐步充实和具体化了这个运动的内容，形成了一个在一千万亩土地上争取亩产万斤粮食的竞赛运动。现在这个运动正在继续向前发展，它不仅直接推动了当前的小春生产，同时也有力地促进了大春作物的播种和插秧等工作的迅速进行，逐步为实现大面积深耕细作和丰产多收创造了极为有利的条件。
    粮食作物与经济作物必须全面发展
    为了实现一九五九年农业战线上的全面跃进，在春耕播种期间，我们特别强调了粮食作物与经济作物必须全面发展。因为在春耕生产期间，部分地区曾经出现过经济作物播种进展迟缓的情况。这种情况发生的原因虽然是多方面的，但主要是同有些人只重视粮食的增产而忽视经济作物的生产有关系。如果这种思想不加以及时的克服，就有可能影响今年经济作物生产任务的完成。另外，有些地区，为着扩大经济作物面积和用大力争取粮食的丰收，因而就有意或无意地把小杂粮、小土特产挤掉的情况也是存在的。为了及时扭转这种情况，我们提出了粮食作物与经济作物并重，全面安排，重点管理，同时用固定粮食与经济作物面积，固定劳动力专门经营经济作物及采用提高单位面积产量和包工包产的办法，来保证完成粮食增产任务和经济作物的播种面积。为了积极发展小杂粮、小土特产，省委最近发动了一个全省每人种植小杂粮一百斤的运动，并明确规定此项小杂粮的收获完全归社员个人所有。总之，我们的要求是既抓粮食，也抓经济作物和小杂粮、小土特产；既抓卫星田，也抓大面积的高产田。这是一个抓住重点带动一般的领导方法，在目前领导农业生产上，强调这种方法，是有着极其重要意义的。
    争取一九五九年农业生产的全面大丰收，除了制定切实可行的生产指标，充分作好政治思想和发动群众开展大面积丰产竞赛运动以外，还必须系统地贯彻农业生产的“八字宪法”。根据我省的具体情况和自然条件，在大春生产方面，我们特别强调以下几点：
      （一）深翻土地。在去年四秋运动以后，我们就发起了一个深翻土地的群众运动。全省除一部分地区深耕一尺五寸外，大部分土地都深耕了一尺左右，对去年没有深耕的土地，要求今年要继续进行深耕，一般田要求深耕一尺左右，高产田深耕一尺五寸，并要求整平耙细。
      （二）积肥造肥。当前积肥造肥的三个主要环节是广开肥源，提高肥效和把肥料迅速运到田间。在目前劳动力紧张，运输工具不足，而大春又急需底肥的情况下，我们采取了因地制宜，就地取材，就地积肥的方针，根据不同的情况，大搞各种烟熏肥、火窑肥、红石骨子肥。这些肥料的特点是：取材容易，制造简单，运输方便，肥效也较高。为了鼓励广大群众积聚人畜粪便的积极性，我们规定了：凡施用私人厕所肥料的，管理区或生产队应给予一定的代价。现在，我省大部分地区都进入了播种插秧的繁忙季节，在农事活路安排不好的地区积肥造肥工作已经停止，而在安排得好的地区，用集中劳动力突击积肥和在水田大沤绿肥的办法，仍然积造了大量的肥料。有的地区利用本地特有的土井盐和硫磺渣等原料制造不少肥效很高的土化肥来，所有这些办法，都值得大力推广。
      （三）推广密植。经过总结一九五八年大跃进的经验，特别是今年小麦的大面积丰产，我省大多数地区，对于密植已经有了信心。但在一部分农民和干部中间，密植思想还不够巩固，他们还存在不同程度的怀疑和顾虑。因此，在继续推广密植中，必须耐心地解决这些思想问题。根据最近了解，凡是把生产指标、密植规格交给群众，发动群众鸣放，并结合参观访问，算细账和回忆对比等办法进行充分讨论的地方，思想问题就解决得比较好，密植也就容易推广。反之，则会形成顶牛，推广不开，停滞不前。推广密植，必须注意因地制宜，积极进行。同时要考虑到深耕程度，底肥追肥的多少以及水源、土质等情况，不能强求一致。
      （四）妥善安排劳动力。在春耕生产期内，必须把农村中百分之七十五到百分之八十的主要劳动力投入农业生产第一线。为了达到这个目的，我们采取了以下五条办法；（1）适当压缩一些有季节性的不急需的社办工业；压缩多种经营、生活福利和牲畜饲养方面占用过多的劳动力；同时，尽量减少脱产的行政干部，使他们直接参加生产；（2）对于那些应该暂时停止的基本建设，必须坚决地暂时停止下来；（3）农业中学等社办学校的学生，必须贯彻半日劳动生产和半日学习的方针，必要时也可以短期停课；坚决取消公社脱产的文工团、体育队；坚决制止劳动力盲目外流；（4）在农忙时，一些老年和儿童如果自愿参加一些力所胜任的劳动，可以采取奖励工资的办法，给以鼓励；（5）动员可能动员的城镇居民支援农业生产。在周总理政府工作报告中指出：
  “解决农村劳动力不足的根本途径，是提高农业的劳动生产率，是逐步实现技术革新和技术革命，逐步实现农具的半机械化和机械化。”在这一时期，我们着重抓运输和春耕夏收所需的插秧、收割、脱粒等几项主要工具的制造工作，同时继续大搞“三五”运动，赶修和抢制各种小农具。
    一九五九年四川省农业生产任务，是艰巨的，也是光荣的。我们具有完成任务的许多有利条件，也作了不少工作。但是，要最后完成和力争超额完成这一任务，还需要尽最大的努力。最近，我省各级领导，根据中共四川省委的部署，亲临农业生产战线，一面参加劳动，一面指挥战斗。一个大规模的犁田、积肥、播种、插秧的群众运动，正在蓬勃发展，完全可以预料，只要我们紧紧依靠党的领导，继续发动群众，走好群众路线，在党中央、毛主席和国务院的领导下，我们一定能够取得比一九五八年更为伟大的胜利。
