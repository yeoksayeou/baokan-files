Xinhua News Agency, Karachi, May 15th. Despite the fact that the proposal by the Pakistani authorities for India to participate in "joint defense" has been rebuffed by India, the Urdu newspaper "Jang" is still working very hard to peddle this stuff in order to provoke India into taking the bait.

This newspaper first uses the method of slandering China to intimidate India. It said that China is "not only Nehru's enemy" but also "the enemy of freedom and consolidation in South Asia." It said that the Chinese "will not only remain in Tibet, but on the contrary, Tibet is in fact a channel, and this channel is now being paved in order to push the storm forward through it."

This newspaper even fabricated such lies: The Chinese are loudly announcing their plan: "Tibet is just a channel for us," and "the main destination is India, which is where we need to reach."

This newspaper then said, "External enemies are watching the whole of India." "The Communists are determined to subvert India." "Not only Kashmir, but the whole of India is about to slip out of hand one by one." This newspaper even said that the Chinese "explained to the Tibetans that they do not need to flee Tibet," and "it is completely useless to run to India for refuge, which tomorrow—if not today—will be under our control."

This newspaper itself knows that no one believes its nonsense, so it hurriedly intensified its tone and said: "These words about the Communists cannot be taken lightly."

This newspaper then fanned the flames. It wrote: "As an experienced politician, Nehru should know that because he placed the Dalai Lama under his protection, he has prepared to deal with the Communists, and now what is needed is that he should be brave and resolutely insist on this measure, and should seek the cooperation of that force (referring to the military bloc manipulated by the United States) that is ready to deal with his opponents side by side with him," "He should first make a sincere attempt to reconcile and understand with Pakistan, which will prove to be his (Nehru's) best supporter in maintaining the consolidation of South Asia." This newspaper wants India to make concessions on issues in dispute with Pakistan. It said that if India agrees to resolve the water dispute and the Kashmir dispute, "it will get a reliable friend like Pakistan."

### 巴基斯坦“战斗报”继续兜售毒品  恶毒诬蔑我国并恐吓印度

    巴基斯坦“战斗报”继续兜售毒品
    恶毒诬蔑我国并恐吓印度
    新华社卡拉奇15日电　尽管巴基斯坦当局提出的要求印度参加“共同防御”的建议在印度碰了壁，乌尔都文报纸“战斗报”却还在十分卖力地兜售这种货色，来挑动印度上钩。
    这家报纸首先用的是污蔑中国以恐吓印度的手法。它说中国“不仅是尼赫鲁的敌人”，而且是“南亚的自由和巩固的敌人。”它说，中国人“不会仅仅限于留在西藏，恰恰相反，事实上西藏是一条通道，现在正在铺设这条通道以便通过它把风暴向前推进。”
    这家报纸甚至制造了这样的谎言：中国人正大张旗鼓地宣布他们的这项计划：“西藏对我们来说，只不过是一条通道”，而“主要的目的地是印度，那里是我们需要达到的地方”。
    这家报纸接着说，“外部敌人正在注视着整个印度”。“共产党人一心想倾复印度”。“不仅是克什米尔，而且整个印度即将一个个地从手中滑走”。这家报纸甚至说，中国人“向西藏人说明，他们无需逃离西藏”，“跑到明天——如果不是今天的话——就将受我们支配的印度去避难，那是完全没有用的。”
    这家报纸自己也知道它这一片鬼话是没人相信的，于是它就赶忙加重语气说：“关于共产党的这些话是不能轻忽看待的”。
    这家报纸接着煽风点火。它写道：“作为一个老练的政治家，尼赫鲁应当知道，由于他把达赖喇嘛置于他的保护下，他已经准备对付共产党，现在需要的是，他应当勇敢，坚决地坚持他的这项措施，应当谋求那种随时准备同他并肩对付他的对手的那种力量（按，即美国操纵的军事集团）的合作”，“应当首先进行真诚的尝试，来同巴基斯坦和解和谅解，巴基斯坦会证明，它是他（尼赫鲁）在保持南亚的巩固方面最好的支持者。”这家报纸要印度在同巴基斯坦有争执的问题上让步。它说，如果印度同意解决运河用水和克什米尔争执的话，“它将得到像巴基斯坦那样可靠的朋友”。
