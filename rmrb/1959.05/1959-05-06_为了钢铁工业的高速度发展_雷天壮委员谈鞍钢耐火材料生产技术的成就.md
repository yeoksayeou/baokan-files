I fully endorse Premier Zhou's government work report, Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the draft of the 1959 national economic plan, and Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1958 state final accounts and the 1959 state budget draft. After listening to these reports, the prosperous scene of the vigorous development of our country's construction in all aspects unfolded before my eyes, increased my strength, and strengthened my confidence in completing this year's plan.

Tibet is an inseparable part of our country; suppressing the Tibetan traitorous clique is our internal affair and brooks no interference. However, imperialists and Indian expansionists are carrying out shameless provocations, echoing each other and clamoring endlessly. Indian officials even distributed the so-called "Dalai Lama's statement." May I ask, how can Indian officials do such an ugly thing? The leader of the Indian Socialist Party openly declared that India should inherit the British imperialists' "monopoly power" over Tibet, confessing the expansionists' ambition in its entirety. With the active support of the Tibetan people, the People's Liberation Army will soon eliminate all the bandits, and the Tibetan people have begun to move towards the bright path of prosperity and progress.

I work in Angang in the field of refractory material technology. I would like to talk about my thoughts and opinions based on what I know about some of the progress in refractory materials in recent years.

During the First Five-Year Plan period, the refractory material industry that the Soviet Union helped us build had the most complete equipment. Through the kind and selfless guidance of Soviet experts in various refractory material specialties, and through studying Soviet literature, the technical strength of the refractory material industry grew rapidly. We have mastered the production technology of various types of refractory materials needed to meet the basic construction and production consumption of iron and steel complexes, and the quality of some important products has reached the international advanced level, with long service life, ensuring the high-speed development of the iron and steel industry.

　　Overcoming Difficulties to Produce New Varieties of High-Quality Refractory Bricks

In recent years, we have been able to further solve some technical problems needed for the development of steel production. With the cooperation of scientific research departments and production units, we overcame the difficulty of chromite ore, which has not been found in our country as a raw material for refractory materials, and used magnesite and bauxite, which are abundant in our country, instead of chromite to make a new type of refractory brick. This brick has a longer service life than the chrome-magnesite bricks commonly used in various industrialized countries, so that Angang no longer uses imported chromite and can use alkaline furnace roofs on all open-hearth furnaces. Other fraternal refractory material production and research units have also creatively solved some important technical problems, putting all levels of high-quality high-alumina bricks into production, and conducting excellent research on high-density magnesia bricks and forsterite bricks. This work has created conditions for various steelmaking furnaces to have high utilization efficiency, and will create conditions for even higher utilization efficiency. Our country lacks steel, and the steelmaking industry itself should use less steel and produce more steel. Therefore, continuously improving the utilization efficiency of steelmaking furnaces is a very important thing. In order to make steelmaking furnaces load more, smelt faster, and last longer, refractory material workers shoulder very arduous tasks. There are indeed thousands upon thousands of topics, and after solving one batch, another batch emerges. This is how steel production continues to grow.

　　Breaking with Conventions, Using Clay Refractory Materials Without Kiln Firing

In the extraordinary year of 1958, the Great Leap Forward in iron and steel production drove the development of refractory materials. Many technical and economic indicators in the production of refractory materials improved, the most prominent being the shortening of kiln firing time, breaking the old rules of the kiln firing curve and opening up a broad road for the increase in refractory brick production.

During the Great Leap Forward, a large amount of technical research work was also carried out. In Angang, research work was carried out on clay refractory materials that can be used without kiln firing. Although this work only involved small-scale trial production and trial use, it was not an experiment in the laboratory. It was produced in a refractory material factory and was used in normal production in two steelmaking plants and one rolling mill. Trial production and trial use included large-sized runner bricks for pit casting and vehicle casting of steel ingots weighing more than five tons; refractory material linings directly rammed with air hammers in steel ladles with a capacity of twenty tons and then seventy tons; and a heating furnace built with dozens of tons of clay refractory bricks that had not been fired. Good results were obtained. This research work was carried out in a relatively broad actual production environment. Although only preliminary results were obtained, it was closer to actual production than the data that could be obtained in the laboratory. In order to confirm what kind of process should be used to produce this type of refractory material, and within what range its products can be used, further laboratory work is needed. Because the laboratory within the enterprise has to undertake the task of solving problems in production on a regular basis, and is limited in terms of materials and equipment, it cannot carry out more systematic work in a short period of three to five months. If a research unit could consider carrying out this work, it may be possible to find a new production path for clay refractory materials. It is estimated that it is not difficult to obtain data that can be used as the basis for designing refractory material factories that are blooming everywhere. Last year, beneficial research work was also carried out in other areas.

　　The Party's Care and Support, and the Wisdom and Help of the Masses, are the Reasons for the Achievements

In the short period of 1958, the technology for the production of refractory materials also achieved the same great achievements as other industries. This was achieved through the great rectification campaign, in which the broad masses of refractory material practitioners criticized the three evils and five airs and all kinds of bourgeois ideology, improved their ideological awareness, and, under the brilliant light of the general line, mustered their energy and strived for the top.

The specific process of the work is not simple. We experienced twists and turns and encountered failures, but finally quickly overcame one difficulty after another. Daring to think, daring to speak, and daring to act were gradually formed through ideological struggle. Some ideas had been formed for a long time, but I dared not speak for fear of being ridiculed as bizarre; some were spoken, but I dared not act or wanted to find a suitable opportunity to do a little bit of exploration. In short, I never thought of daring to ram a lining in a steel ladle with a capacity of seventy tons.

The Party helped us clear our minds. The secretary gave us reports, organized studies, talked to us, and convened an enlarged Party committee to formulate a work plan after listening to everyone's opinions. Through competitions and presentations, we formed a joyful and powerful momentum; we were often taught to use the spirit of the general line to examine our work; and some comrades were criticized for their small-handedness in their work, so that everyone was liberated from the constraints of small-handedness. However, setbacks in work only encouraged us; we were organized to work collectively instead of each person taking on a topic to work on alone. Everyone jointly put forward topics, proposed solutions, defined steps, and arranged schedules, and then divided the work to be executed. When we encountered problems, we studied them collectively, and when we reached key points, we all mobilized together; we twisted the technical work summaries and mutual evaluations together.

In some cases, carrying out research work may temporarily affect production. Even during the tense days of the third quarter of 1958, we invariably received strong assistance from the Party committee, trade union, workers, and technicians of the factory where we were working; when our work suffered setbacks or affected production, they all encouraged us to do it again and do it boldly; this quickly dispelled our feelings of guilt caused by failure. When working, we worked with the workers, and many specific problems could be solved in a timely manner. When we were preparing our work, the workers also urged us to go to production for testing as soon as possible.

The responsible comrades of our unit's Party committee went to our work place to encourage us. Fearing that everyone was too tired, they stipulated working hours and arranged for our lives. In short, under the leadership of the Party and under the Party's meticulous care, we enthusiastically and happily carried out the technical revolution. This year is the key year for three years of hard work, and we will certainly do more, better, and more comprehensive work than last year.

I fully agree with the work report of the Standing Committee of the Second National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference made by Vice Chairman Li Weihan, and I will definitely work hard in accordance with the five aspects of work that should be strengthened in the future as pointed out in the report.

　　为了钢铁工业的高速度发展
    雷天壮委员谈鞍钢耐火材料生产技术的成就
    我完全拥护周总理所作的政府工作报告、李富春副总理所作的关于一九五九年国民经济计划草案的报告和李先念副总理所作的关于一九五八年国家决算和一九五九年国家预算草案的报告。听了这些报告，眼前展开了我国各方面建设蓬勃发展的繁荣景象，增多了力量，对完成今年的计划更加强了信心。
    西藏是我国不可分割的组成部分；讨伐西藏叛国集团是我国内政，不容干涉。但帝国主义和印度扩张主义分子竟然进行无耻挑衅，你呼我应，叫嚣不已。印度官员居然散发所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”，请问，印度官员怎么能够干出这种丑事？印度社会党领袖公然宣称印度应继承英帝国主义对西藏的“垄断权力”，和盘招供了扩张分子的野心。人民解放军在藏族人民积极支援下，即将肃清全部叛匪，西藏人民已开始走向繁荣进步的光明大道。
    我在鞍钢从事于耐火材料技术方面工作，仅就我所知道的有关耐火材料几年来的一些进展情况，谈谈自己的感想和意见。
    在第一个五年计划期间，苏联帮助我们建设的耐火材料工业有着最完善的装备。通过耐火材料各专业的苏联专家亲切无私的指导，通过学习苏联文献，耐火材料工业的技术力量迅速地成长壮大起来。我们已掌握了能够满足钢铁联合企业基本建设和生产消耗所需要的各类品种耐火材料的生产技术，并且某一些重要制品的质量也达到了国际先进水平，有着长的使用寿命，保证了钢铁工业的高速度发展。
    攻克难关，生产出质量优良的耐火砖新品种
    近几年，我们能够进一步解决一些为发展钢铁生产所需要的技术问题了。在科学研究部门和生产单位的协作下，攻克了我国尚未发现可以作为耐火材料原料的铬铁矿这一道难关，利用我国储量丰富的菱镁石和矾土而不用铬矿作出来了一种新的耐火砖。这种砖较诸各工业先进国所普遍采用的铭镁砖，在使用寿命上还要长一些，从而使鞍钢不再使用进口铬矿而能够在全部平炉上采用碱性炉顶。在其它兄弟耐火材料生产和研究单位也创造性地解决了一些重要技术问题，使各级高质量的高铝砖投入生产，对高密度镁砖、镁橄榄石砖进行了出色的研究工作。这一些工作已经为各类炼钢炉可以有高的利用效率，并将为能够有更高的利用效率创造了条件。我国缺少钢，应当使炼钢工业本身少用钢而多产钢，因此不断提高炼钢炉的利用效率是一件非常重要的事情。为着使炼钢炉多装、快炼、高寿，耐火材料工作者便担负着十分艰巨的任务，其中确是存在着千千万万个课题，解决了一批又涌现一批，就是这样来使钢的生产不断地增长。
    打破陈规，不经烧窑作业使用粘土质耐火材料
    在不平凡的一九五八年，钢铁大跃进带动了耐火材料，在耐火材料的生产上很多技术经济指标提高了，最突出的是烧窑时间的缩短，打破了对于烧窑曲线的陈旧规律，为耐火砖的产量增长打开了一条大道。
    在大跃进中，也进行了工作量很大的技术研究工作。在鞍钢进行了不经过烧窑作业便能够使用的粘土质耐火材料研究工作。这项工作虽然是只进行了小批试制和试用，但是它不是在试验室里的试验，在耐火材料生产厂中生产出来，并且分别在两个炼钢厂和一个轧钢厂在正常生产中进行了试用。试制和试用包括了坑铸和车铸五吨多重钢锭的大型号流钢砖；在二十吨然后在七十吨容量的钢水罐中直接用空气锤捣打的耐火材料内衬、用几十吨没有经过烧窑作业的粘土耐火砖砌了一座加热炉；都获得了良好的使用效果。这项研究工作是在较为广泛的实际生产中进行的，虽然仅只获得了初步结果，较诸在试验室中所能取得的资料，则接近生产实际一些。为着肯定这一类耐火材料到底要用怎样一个流程来生产，其制品能够在一个多大范围内使用，便需要作进一步的试验室工作。由于企业内的试验室要担负生产中经常解决问题的任务，并且在资料、设备各方面都受到限制，不能够在三、五个月的短期内来作较为系统化的工作，如果能够有研究单位考虑进行这项工作，便有可能找出一条新的粘土质耐火材料生产途径。估计不难取得可以为遍地开花的耐火材料工厂作为设计的依据资料。去年在其它方面也进行了有益的研究工作。
    党的关怀和支持，群众的智慧和帮助，是取得成绩的原因
    在一九五八年这一段短的时间内，在耐火材料生产技术上也取得了和其他工业同样巨大的成就，是通过伟大的整风运动，广大的耐火材料从业人员批判了三风五气和形形色色的资产阶级思想，提高了思想觉悟，在总路线的光辉照耀下，鼓起了干劲，力争上游所取得的。
    工作的具体过程是不简单的。经历过曲折，遭遇过失败，但终于迅速地克服了一种又一种困难。敢想、敢说、敢干是经过思想斗争逐渐形成的。有些想法是形成已久，怕被讥为怪诞便不敢说；有些是说了但不敢干或是想找适当机会，小小地干一干，探索探索。总之从来也没有想到敢于在一个容量为七十吨的钢水罐中去捣打一个内衬。
    党帮助我们打通了思想。书记给我们作报告，组织学习，找我们谈心，听取了大家的意见后召开扩大党委会来制订工作计划，通过竞赛、献礼形成喜气洋洋的壮大声势；经常教导我们用总路线的精神来检查工作；对于一些同志在工作中的小手小脚而进行批评，使大家从小手小脚的束缚中解放出来。但工作上的一些挫折则只是鼓励；组织大家集体地进行工作而不是每人独抱一个题目去单干。大家共同提出课题，提出解决方案，厘定步骤，安排日程然后分工执行。碰到问题集体研究，进行到关键处一齐出动；将技术工作总结和互相评比拧在一起。
    在某些情况下进行研究工作是有可能暂时影响生产。纵然在一九五八年第三季度那样生产紧张的日子里，我们也毫无例外地得到了在我们进行工作的工厂的党委、工会、工人和技术人员的大力协助；在工作受到挫折或者影响了生产的时候，他们都一致鼓励我们再次来干，大胆地干；这样便使我们因失败而产生的负疚心情很快地消失掉。在工作的时候和工人一起劳动，很多具体问题能够及时解决，在我们作准备工作时，工人也催促我们希望我们尽快地再到生产中去试验。
    我们单位的党委的负责同志，到我们工作地点去鼓励我们，怕大家太疲劳，规定了工作时间，安排了生活。总之，我们在党的领导、在党的无微不至的关怀下，兴奋愉快地来搞技术革命。今年是苦战三年关键性的一年，我们当然要比去年作出更多更好更全面的工作。
    我完全同意李维汉副主席所作的中国人民政治协商会议第二届全国委员会常务委员会工作报告，并一定按照报告中所指出的今后应当加强的五个方面工作努力以赴。
