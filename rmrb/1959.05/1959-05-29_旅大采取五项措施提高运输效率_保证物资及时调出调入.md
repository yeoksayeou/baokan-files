    Lüda Adopts Five Measures to Improve Transportation Efficiency
    Ensure Timely Delivery of Materials

    (From our dispatch) Lüda City is vigorously improving short-distance transportation efficiency to rapidly distribute materials for railways and seaports, ensuring the city's timely import and export of production and living materials.

    This year, Lüda City's material transportation volume increased by 72% compared to last year, averaging over 250,000 ton-kilometers per day. In order to prevent the backlog of key materials and meet the needs of the Great Leap Forward in production, the city's transportation department has taken five measures. First, strengthen the planning, organization, and dispatch of short-distance transportation. On the one hand, stationed personnel are placed at railways and seaports to keep abreast of the arrival of goods from other places; on the other hand, special personnel are sent to assist more than 200 factories, mines, and enterprises throughout the city in preparing consignment plans on an annual, quarterly, and monthly basis. This allows for a clear understanding in advance of the types and quantities of goods to be transferred in and out of the city at each period, transportation routes and distances, and storage locations. Then, based on the principle of prioritizing urgency and according to the characteristics of various transportation tools, reasonable allocation and use are made. Ten flatbed truck stations have been set up in the most prosperous areas of the city to help various agencies, factories, mines, and shops transport miscellaneous materials. In order to improve mileage utilization and reduce the empty running time of vehicles, transportation points have been set up in ten locations throughout the city with large material distribution volumes. Multi-angle circular transportation is implemented between these points, eliminating empty runs, thus greatly improving mileage utilization. Second, implement the motor vehicle train system. Currently, each motor vehicle has an average of one and a half trailers. Third, three training courses were opened to train motor vehicle drivers, changing vehicles that previously worked one shift a day to working two shifts, totaling sixteen hours. Fourth, according to the characteristics of frequent short-distance transportation loading and unloading, vigorously improve loading and unloading efficiency by mobilizing the masses to innovate loading and unloading tools. Employees have now created more than 30 types of machinery, mechanizing 32% of cargo loading and unloading. In the past, it took four workers to lift a barrel of gasoline onto a truck. With the recent development of a barrel loading machine, only two people are needed. Some vehicles have been equipped with automatic two-way tipping devices, eliminating the need for workers to unload sand and gravel. In addition, labor organization has also been improved. Originally, each vehicle was followed by two or three workers for loading and unloading. Now, loading and unloading workers from each vehicle are concentrated and fixed in places with larger loading and unloading tasks to work together, increasing loading and unloading efficiency by a quarter. Fifth, establish vehicle repair and fitting stations, manufacture spare parts independently, and implement mechanized maintenance and repair. According to national regulations, each vehicle must undergo a secondary maintenance after running 4,000 kilometers. In the past, each maintenance took four hours. Recently, workers created a set of maintenance tools, reducing the time to only 50 minutes.

    As a result of Lüda City's implementation of the above five measures, the phenomenon of material backlog rarely occurs in stations, seaports, and various factory and mining enterprise departments, and key materials are delivered as soon as they arrive.

    旅大采取五项措施提高运输效率
    保证物资及时调出调入
    本报讯　旅大市大力提高短途运输效率，迅速为铁路、海港集散物资，保证了全市及时地调出调入生产资料和生活资料。
    今年，旅大市物资调运量比去年增长72％，平均每天达到二十五万吨公里以上。为了作到重点物资不积压，满足生产大跃进的需要，市内交通运输部门采取了五项措施。第一，加强短途运输的计划、组织和调度。一方面，在铁路和海港设立驻在员，随时掌握外地到货情况；另方面派专人帮助全市二百多厂矿企业，按年、按季、按月编制托运计划，以便预先对全市每个时期调出调入的货种、货量、运输道路和距离、存货场所等，作到心中有数，然后根据轻重缓急的原则，并且按各种交通工具的特点，合理的调配使用。全市在最繁华的地区设立了十个平板车站点，帮助各机关、厂矿、商店运送零星物资。为了提高里程利用率，减少汽车空驶时间，全市十个物资集散量大的地方，设立了运输点，各点之间实行多角循环运输，不驶空车，因而大大提高了里程利用率。第二，实行汽车列车化。现在平均每辆汽车已有一个半挂车。第三，开办了三次训练班，训练汽车司机，让过去每天工作一班的汽车，改为工作两班，共十六小时。第四，根据短途运输装卸比较频繁的特点，大力提高装卸效率，办法是发动群众革新装卸工具。现在职工已创造了三十多种机械，使32％的货物装卸机械化了。过去向汽车上装一桶汽油，需要四个工人抬，最近制成装桶机以后，只要两个人就行了。一部分汽车已经装上自动两侧倾卸设备，卸砂子和石子就不需要工人了。另外，还改进了劳动组织，原来每辆车由两三个工人跟着装卸，现在实行各个车上的装卸工人都集中起来，固定在装卸任务较大的地方，协力工作，装卸效率提高了四分之一。第五，建立汽车修配站，自制备品，实行保养修理机械化。国家规定每辆汽车跑四千公里要进行一次二级保养，过去每次要用四小时，最近工人创造了一套保养工具，一次只要五十分钟。
    旅大市实行上述五项措施的结果，车站、海港和各厂矿企业部门，都很少发生物资积压现象，重点物资更作到了随到随运。
