Eighteen Iron Men, Eighteen Red Hearts
By our reporters Tong Xiwen and Li Jianyu

	It was a drizzly early summer day, and Fuxin, a coal city in the western Liaoning hills, was shrouded in heavy fog all day long. There was a silence above the mine. It turned out that the high-yield competition between the "August 1st" tunneling team and the Li Baoshu tunneling team of the Xinqiu Mine had been decided in the past twenty-four hours. Before the start of this fierce battle, there had been heated debate. Although the "August 1st" tunneling team was recognized as a "tiger team," most people still favored Li Baoshu's team to win. No one expected the "August 1st" tunneling team to surpass the famous Li Baoshu team with a record of 15.6 meters per day, exceeding the original target by one time!

	We met Wang Weichang, the "Li Kui" of the "August 1st" tunneling team, at the entrance of the team's pit. He was wearing a willow-woven protective hat, and a bright mining lamp was slung over his shoulder as he prepared to go down the well for the shift change. Suddenly, a man dressed the same as Wang Weichang hurried out of the mine and blocked Wang Weichang's path. This man was covered in mud and water, his thin face was covered with coal dust, his expression was tense but unusually calm. Compared with Wang Weichang, he seemed so gentle. After Wang Weichang's introduction, we learned that he was Xu Fuan, the political instructor of the "August 1st" tunneling team. He wanted Wang Weichang to stay and hold a meeting with the other two group leaders, Zhang Xuehai and Wang Yongde, to solve the problem of mine cars during the operation. So we also participated in this "battlefield meeting" and wanted to take this opportunity to understand the situation we needed to know most.

	These eighteen men who had been tempered in the flames of war were all demobilized and transferred from the People's Liberation Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army around 1956. When they came to the Fuxin Coal Mine with battle wounds and gleaming combat medals, they were like ignorant children standing on the edge of a deep and mysterious sea, unfamiliar with everything and everything was fresh to them. But when they learned that coal was the grain of the country's industrial construction, they loved this profession, which was called "coal black" in the old society, from the bottom of their hearts and firmly demanded to be the vanguard tunneling workers in coal production.

	In 1957, just after the great "August 1st" Army Day, a serious situation suddenly appeared in the mine where tunnel tunneling was far behind the needs of coal mining. Xu Fuan, an outstanding scout who had been wounded in the Battle of Tashan during the Liberation War, was particularly worried about this matter. At this moment, Zhang Xuehai, Wang Yongde and other demobilized soldiers came to him. Wang Yongde, who had been a squad leader in the army, said excitedly: "Thousands of troops and horses are gathered at the starting point of the charge, but the gap cannot be opened. What should we do?" Zhang Xuehai, a veteran squad leader who had made three great achievements in the army, continued: "Wherever it is most difficult, we should go there." The resourceful Xu Fuan came up with an idea: "If everyone is determined, can we organize a tunneling team?" Everyone said, "Yes!" So they jointly invited a dozen demobilized soldiers to submit a request to the Party committee to organize a demobilized soldiers tunneling team.

	Their request was immediately approved by the Party committee, and the "August 1st" tunneling team was born.

	After the team was established, the first task they received was to make lower horizontal drifts in the coal mining field. At the beginning, they knocked down five sheds with one shot, and then encountered coal seam flexures and sandstone. Veteran squad leader Zhang Xuehai desperately held the wind drill, and the drill bit was dry-drilling on the rock. It just slipped and could not get in, and everyone's eyes were burning with anxiety, but still no work came out. In this situation, some people could not help but feel discouraged, saying: "Let's disband if we don't have the skills! So as not to embarrass the army!" Wang Weichang, who was called "Black Whirlwind Li Kui," was anxious. He glared his eyes round and said in a rough voice: "What, are you afraid of hard stones! People are alive, stones are dead. In the battlefield, we eliminated thousands of enemies who could run. Can we be frightened by a dead stone!" Xu Fuan waved his hand to Wang Weichang and continued: "Comrades, you should think about fighting in the tunnels in Korea. At that time, we used sledgehammers to strike and held the drill bits in our hands, as if we were digging with our hands. That's how thousands of mountains were tunneled through by us. Now can we bow our heads to it when using mechanical operations? Communists and people's soldiers must have such hard bones!" Coincidentally, in the most difficult situation, the Party sent them veteran workers. Under the veteran workers' diligent guidance, they learned humbly and finally created the method of "water washing wind drill," successfully opening the first technical barrier to attacking nature.

	Since then, they have had a good start, a good shift, and a good day, and they have almost been leading every month. In 1958, they completed the 1,400-meter tunneling plan forty days ahead of schedule. This year, they created the highest tunneling record of 215.8 meters per month in the entire province's coal mines, and became a glorious red flag for demobilized soldiers in the entire province.

	At the end of the roadway, coal dust was falling, rock powder was flying, and everyone's face was covered with coal powder. The outgoing shift went down the well, or rather, they had been down there for almost an hour, and the incoming shift had not yet come up, which was really puzzling. But Party Branch Secretary Zhang smiled and said to us: "This is not surprising at all. They must be doing cross-operations again."

	"Cross-operations?" This aroused our great interest. To explain this issue, Secretary Zhang continued: "The reason why the "August 1st" team and the Li Baoshu team were able to achieve the final victory in that fierce competition not long ago was because the cross-operations were done well. On that day, the three shifts were chasing each other, each striving to be the first, but in the competition, they did not forget to create conditions for each other and support each other. Those with experience and skills passed them on to the next shift, and whoever encountered difficulties or dangers took care of them. They did not leave when it was time to change shifts and continued to work. I helped you for two hours, and you helped me for three hours. Some people, like Wang Weichang, Zhang Xuehai, Wang Yongde, and Xu Fuan, worked for more than ten hours in a row, forgetting to eat." We asked: "Isn't that too tiring?" He said with emotion: "They just have a lot of energy. Otherwise, people wouldn't call them eighteen warriors. They never seem to know fatigue. As a Party Branch Secretary, I don't know how much I have persuaded them to rest. They won't listen to either soft or hard persuasion. I simply can't do anything with them." Saying this, Secretary Zhang spread out his hands, and then brought them back together, saying: "You have already met Wang Weichang. On the day of the competition, I ordered him to rest for a while. Guess what he said: 'Letting me rest is more uncomfortable than being sick!' This is their attitude towards labor."

	What about the others besides Wang Weichang? Secretary Zhang told us: Wang Yongde cherishes collective honor more than his family. On the day of the fierce battle, it happened to be when his wife gave birth to a child, but he could not bear to leave the mine for a moment; Gong Kefa's thigh was broken by a winch rope. People pulled him to the hospital to put some medicine on it, and asked him to lie down at home to rest for a while, but he came to the mine again and said to his comrades: "Minor injuries should not leave the line of fire. This is the old rule!" Chen Tianli has postponed his wedding date four times in order to participate in the coal grabbing battle…. Ren Kedong, Secretary of the Xinqiu Mine Party Committee, praised them, saying: "You are really eighteen iron men with eighteen red hearts."

    十八个铁人，十八颗红心
    本报记者　佟希文　李健羽
    初夏的一个细雨蒙蒙的日子，辽西丘陵上的煤城阜新，整日都笼罩在浓重的云雾里。矿井地面上一片沉寂。原来，在过去二十四小时内，新丘矿八一掘进队与李宝书掘进队的一场高产竞赛已经揭晓；这场激战没有开始以前，人们曾有过热烈的争论。尽管八一掘进队是公认的“虎队”，但大多数人仍然倾向于李宝书队势在必胜，谁也没有想到八一掘进队竟以日进十五点六公尺、超过原订指标一倍的纪录，赛过著名的李宝书队！
    我们在八一掘进队的坑口，碰上了这个队的“李逵”王维昌。他头上戴着柳条编的防护帽，一盏闪着亮光的矿灯搭在肩头，正准备下井换班了。忽然，一个与王维昌同样打扮的人，匆匆忙忙地走出矿井挡住了王维昌的去路。这人浑身全是泥水，瘦削的脸上满布煤屑，神态紧张却又异常沉着，与王维昌一比较，显得是那样的文静。经王维昌一介绍，我们才知道他就是八一掘进队的政治指导员徐福安。他要王维昌留下来，与另外两个小组长张学海、王永德在一起开个碰头会，解决作业中的车皮问题。于是我们也参加了这个“阵地会议”，并且想趁这个机会了解一下我们最需要知道的情况。
    这十八个经过战火洗炼的人，都是在1956年前后从人民解放军和中国人民志愿军中复员转业的。当他们带着斑斑战伤和金光闪闪的战斗奖章，来到阜新煤矿时，简直如同一个无知的孩子站在深邃奥秘的大海边一样，对什么都是生疏的、新鲜的。但当他们了解到煤炭是祖国工业建设的粮食的时候，他们就从心眼里爱上了这个在旧社会被人们称作“煤黑子”的职业，并且坚决地要求担当煤炭生产的尖兵掘进工。
    1957年，伟大的“八一”建军节刚刚过去，矿井里忽然出现了巷井掘进大大落后于采煤需要的严重局面。在解放战争中曾在东北塔山阻击战中负过伤的出色侦查员徐福安特别为这件事着急。就在这时，张学海、王永德等复员军人来找他了。在部队里当过班长的王永德激动地说：“冲锋出发地集结着千军万马，可就是打不开缺口，这怎么办？”在部队里立过三大战功的老班长张学海接着说：“那里最困难，我们就应该到那里去。”足智多谋的徐福安想出主意来了：“要是大家有决心，我们组织一个掘进队行不行？”大家说：“行！”于是他们共同邀请了十几个复员军人，向党委提出了组织一个复员军人掘进队的要求。
    他们的要求，马上得到党委的批准，八一掘进队诞生了。
    建队后，第一次接受的任务是作采煤场子下横川。开始他们一炮就崩倒了五个棚子，紧接着又遇上了煤层折曲和砂岩。老班长张学海狠命地把着风钻，钎子头在岩石上干打，光出溜就是进不去，个个眼睛都急得冒出火来了，还是不出活。在这个情况下，有的人不免灰心，说：“咱们没有技术就散伙罢！省得给部队丢人！”被人家称为“黑旋风李逵”的王维昌急坏了，他把两眼瞪得溜圆，粗声粗气地说：“怎的，怕石头硬啦！人是活的，石头是死的，在战场我们消灭了成千上万个有腿能跑的敌人，还能让一块死石头吓住！”徐福安向王维昌摆摆手，接着说：“同志们应该想想在朝鲜打山洞。那时候我们是用大锤打，手把钎子，像用手掏一样，就是这样千百座山都被我们掏通了，现在用机械作业还能向它低头吗？共产党员、人民战士就要有这样的硬骨头！”恰巧，在最困难的情况下，党给他们派来了老工人，在老工人勤恳地指导下，他们虚心地学习，终于创造了“水洗风钻”的方法，胜利地攻开了向大自然进攻的第一个技术关。
    这以后，他们开门红、班班红、日日红，几乎是月月领先。1958年提前四十天完成了一千四百公尺的掘进计划，今年又创造了月进二百一十五点八公尺的全省煤矿最高掘进纪录，并且成了全省复员军人的一面光辉的红旗。
    在巷道的尽头，煤屑刷刷地落下来，岩粉飞扬着，每个人的脸都被煤粉糊满了。换班的小组下井了，准确一点说，下去快一个小时了，还不见井里的那个小组上来，这真使人纳闷。可是党总支张书记却笑着对我们说：“这一点也不奇怪，他们一定是又搞交叉作业了。”
  “交叉作业？”这引起了我们很大的兴趣。为了说明这个问题，张书记接着说：“八一队和李宝书队在不久前那场激烈的竞赛中，所以能够取得最后胜利，就是因为交叉作业搞得好。这一天，他们三个班，你追我赶，个个争先，但是在竞赛中，他们并没有忘掉互相创造条件和互相支援。有经验有窍门一班一班往下交，有困难有危险谁遇到谁包干，该换班的时候不走连续干，我帮你两小时，你帮我三小时，有的人像王维昌、张学海、王永德、徐福安等人竟一连干了十几个小时，连吃饭都忘了。”我们问：“那恐怕太累了吧？”他感慨地说：“他们就是有股子猛劲，要不然人家也不会叫他们十八勇士了。他们好像从来不知道劳累似的，作为一个党总支书记，为了叫他们休息，我不知费了多少口舌、软的硬的他们都不吃，简直对他们没办法。”说到这里，张书记摊开了两手，紧接着又收拢回来说：“你们已经认识王维昌了，竞赛那天我命令他休息一会，你猜他说什么——‘让我休息，比得场病还难受！’这就是他们对待劳动的态度。”
    除了王维昌以外，别的人又怎样呢？张书记告诉我们：王永德爱护集体荣誉胜过爱家，激战那天，正赶上他老婆生孩子，可是他却一时也舍不得离开矿井；宫克发大腿被绞绳打破了，人家扯他上医院上点药，按他躺在家里休息一会，但他又到矿井来了，并向同志们说：“轻伤不下火线，这是老规矩了！”陈天礼，为了参加夺煤大战已经四次推迟婚期了……。新丘矿党委书记任克东称赞他们说：“你们真是十八个铁人，十八颗红心”。
