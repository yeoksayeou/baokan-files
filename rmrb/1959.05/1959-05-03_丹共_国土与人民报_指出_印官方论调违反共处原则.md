Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, May 1st: Copenhagen dispatch: The Danish Communist Party's organ, "Land and People's Daily," published an article on April 30th commemorating the fifth anniversary of the signing of the Sino-Indian agreement on peaceful coexistence.

The article then condemned the recent strong clamor for "Tibetan independence" stirred up by reactionary forces in India, and pointed out that Indian officials are also talking a lot about this "independence," albeit in more cautious terms. The article said that this kind of argument from Indian officials clearly violates the provisions regarding "the Tibet region of China" stipulated in the agreement. The article said that the fact that the so-called "Dalai Lama's statement" was distributed to the press by an Indian official clearly violates the principle of non-interference in internal affairs.

The article emphasized that the Chinese government has repeatedly emphasized the value of maintaining friendly relations with India, and recent facts show that the Chinese are right to suspect whether Indian politicians have any intention of undermining the agreement on peaceful coexistence.

    丹共“国土与人民报”指出
    印官方论调违反共处原则
    新华社柏林1日电　哥本哈根消息：丹麦共产党机关报“国土与人民报”4月30日发表文章纪念中国和印度关于和平共处协议签订五周年。
    这篇文章接着谴责了最近时期印度反动势力所掀起的关于“西藏独立”的强烈叫嚣，并且指出，印度官方人士也在大谈这种“独立”，尽管措词比较谨慎。文章说，来自印度官方的这种论调，显然是违反了协议中所规定的关于“中国西藏地方”的条款。文章说，所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”由印度一位官员向报界分发的事实很显然是违反了互不干涉内政的原则的。
    文章强调指出，中国政府多次强调与印度保持友好关系的价值，而最近事实表明中国人怀疑印度政界人士是否有破坏和平共处的协议的企图是正确的。
