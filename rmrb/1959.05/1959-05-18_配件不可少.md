　　Accessories are Indispensable
　　The various attachments and accessories on a machine are like the various organs on a human body. It is impossible to do without any of them.
　　For example, people have eyes, and machines also have eyes. Various instruments are the eyes of the machine. For example, people have circulatory organs, and machines also have circulatory organs. Various transmission devices belong to this category. If a person only has a torso and lacks other organs, it is difficult to call it a person. Similarly, a machine that is missing parts is difficult to call a machine, because it cannot function.
　　Explaining the role of accessories and attachments does not negate the importance of the main component. The main component is still the backbone of the machine, and without the main component, it is like a person without a torso. However, machines cannot be completely compared with humans. A person who is missing eyes or a hand or foot can still eat, walk, produce, and entertain. However, a machine that is missing attachments, accessories, or even a screw may become a pile of dead iron and cannot move.
　　It can be seen that machine accessories are a major matter. While producing the main engine, we must properly arrange the production of accessories. Units that produce accessories and attachments must not only implement each item to ensure the needs of the main engine, but also the delivery date must be closely linked to the production of the main component. It is absolutely not allowed to complete the production of the main component at the beginning of the year, while the accessories and various parts are not fully equipped until the end of the year. The most ideal approach is that the production of all accessories and attachments should be ahead of the main component as much as possible. It is better for accessories and attachments to wait for the main component than for the main component to wait for accessories.
　　The important significance of Beijing, Tianjin, Changchun and other places in seizing accessory production lies here.

### 配件不可少

    配件不可少
  机器上的各种附件和配件，好比人身上的各种器官一样，缺少一样都不行。
    比如说，人有眼睛，机器也有眼睛，各种仪表就是机器的眼睛；比如说，人有循环器官，机器也有循环器官，各种传动设备就是属于这一类。假设一个人只有躯干，缺少其它的器官，那就很难说是一个人；同样，一部机器，缺东拉西，也就很难说是一部机器了，因为它不可能发挥作用。
    说明配件和附件的作用，并不是抹煞主件的重要性，主件仍然是机器的骨干，没有主件就好比人没有躯干一样。但是，机器还不能和人完全相比，一个人缺了眼睛，或者缺了一只手脚，照样可以吃饭、走路、生产、娱乐；然而，一台机器缺少了附件配件甚至一个螺丝钉，它就可能变成一堆死铁，不能动弹。
    可见，机器的配件是一件大事，我们在生产主机的同时，必须妥善安排配件的生产。生产配件附件的单位，不仅要件件落实，以保证主机的需要，就是交货的日期也得跟主件的生产紧密衔接，绝不能年初完成了主件的生产，而附件以及各种零件却要到年底才配齐。最理想的做法是，所有的附件配件的生产，尽可能走在主件的前面，宁可配件附件等主件，绝不要主件等配件。
    北京、天津、长春等地抓紧配件生产的重要意义，也就在这里。
