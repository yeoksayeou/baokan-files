Rural Cadres Should Study Science and Technology
Ganxian and Tongren County Cadres Devote Themselves to Technology, Leading Production More Effectively

Our Newspaper, Ganxian, 14th - To better lead production, the vast number of rural cadres in Ganxian County, Jiangxi Province, are actively studying production technology, creating favorable conditions.

Since communization, production scale has steadily expanded, production content has become increasingly complex, and production technology has constantly innovated. In order to enable cadres to better lead production, the Ganxian County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has formulated many measures, launching a surge in learning production technology among the vast number of cadres, with everyone learning technology and everyone engaging in experimentation. After arduous study and research, all cadres in the county have now mastered basic production technologies. Through experimentation, many cadres have also mastered some of the more complex production knowledge and technology.

Ganxian cadres have various ways and methods of studying production technology. Practice has proven that the following five methods can be universally promoted and have the best results: 1. Communes establish Red and Expert Schools for cadres, holding production technology classes once or twice a week, taught by agricultural technicians and experienced farmers. The course content focuses on the "Eight-Character Charter" for agriculture, learning whatever technology is needed for the current agricultural work. 2. Learning from experienced farmers. Cadres above the production team branch secretary level personally convene farmers' symposiums once a month to absorb various production experiences. 3. According to the season, regularly hold various technical training classes, organizing cadres to undergo technical training in turn. 4. Cadres at all levels participate in planting experimental plots. 5. Carefully read the "Agricultural Almanac" and "Agricultural Technical Operating Regulations" compiled and printed by the County Committee according to the county's conditions; and stipulate that at least five hours per week be devoted to self-study.

Ganxian had never grown cotton before, and this year plans to plant 16,000 mu of cotton. In order to overcome the technical barrier of cotton planting, Huang Deyuan, Deputy Secretary of the County Committee, carefully studied more than ten books on cotton planting techniques, visited more than ten agricultural technicians, then investigated the natural environment of various regions in the county, and convened several farmers' symposiums to listen to their opinions. After repeated study, Huang Deyuan put forward a set of opinions on local cotton planting technical measures. The results of following these opinions are that the cotton seedlings sown this year are growing as well as the cotton seedlings in the advanced cotton planting areas of neighboring counties.

Cadres have become familiar with the entire growth process of crops from beginning to end, learned a lot of extremely useful production knowledge and production technology, and greatly improved and increased their courage and confidence in leading production. Dong Liping, First Secretary of the Jibu Commune Party Committee, did not understand production technology before and lacked sufficient confidence in leading the commune to achieve a great leap forward in production this year. Now, Dong Liping's enthusiasm is growing. After repeated meetings, discussions, and consultations with all commune cadres and the masses, they have confidently formulated a plan for continued leap forward this year and measures to achieve this plan. Currently, Dong Liping often engages in field management with commune members, striving for a bumper harvest of early rice. (Liu Guanghui)

Our Newspaper, Guiyang, 14th - In Tongren County, Guizhou, cadres learning technology has become a prevailing trend. All of the county's more than 4,000 production team leaders and above have learned more than ten agricultural production technologies. They generally master the planting and operation techniques for rice, corn, wheat, and various miscellaneous grains. Cadres going to the fields are no longer laymen leaders, but lead production in the posture of ordinary laborers who are experts, powerfully promoting the current production movement.

After cadres have mastered certain agricultural production technologies, leading agricultural production becomes more practical and effective. In spring plowing production, the county has formulated technical operating regulations for planting twelve kinds of crops such as rice and corn, adapted to local conditions, researched and promoted more than 390 spring sowing technologies, and identified and promoted more than 52 types and more than 90,000 pieces of spring plowing and spring sowing tools, making land preparation, fertilization, sowing, and rice transplanting more solid and meticulous than in previous years. In these production activities, cadres not only learned technology, but also disseminated technology. For example, Huang Ronghua, Secretary of the Jiangkou Commune Party Committee, immediately convened an on-site meeting after learning how to manufacture several kinds of indigenous fertilizers, promoting it throughout the commune. Subsequently, the County Committee organized two technical performance teams for manufacturing indigenous fertilizers to tour and perform throughout the county.

The trend of cadres at all levels in Tongren County diligently studying technology was initiated by the Tongren County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. In last year's mass technical innovation movement, the leading comrades of the County Committee deeply realized that leading by example is an important key to encouraging the masses to learn technology and comprehensively implement the Eight-Character Charter for agriculture. Comrade Yao Hongxian, Secretary of the County Committee, learned more than 130 agricultural production technologies in Jiangkou Commune in one year, thereby rapidly opening up the situation for cadres and the masses to learn technology. Cadres at all levels of the county, commune, and production team quickly launched a surge of "everyone delving into technology, everyone understanding science," and "learn wherever you go, learn whatever you do." Now, in addition to the County Committee and Commune Party Committee establishing technical innovation committees, management districts and production teams have established a total of 95 technical teaching stations, 104 agricultural technical night schools, and 1,360 agricultural scientific research groups.

    农村干部要学习科学技术
    赣县和铜仁县干部钻研技术形成风气，领导生产更加有力
    本报赣县14日电　江西省赣县广大农村干部积极学习生产技术，为更好地领导生产创造了条件。
    公社化以后，生产规模日益扩大，生产内容日益复杂，生产技术步步革新，为了使干部能更好地领导生产，中共赣县县委制定许多措施，在广大干部中掀起了个个学技术、人人搞试验的学习生产技术的热潮。全县干部经过刻苦学习钻研，现在都已经掌握了基本的生产技术。许多干部通过试验，还掌握了一些较复杂的生产知识和技术。
    赣县干部学习生产技术的方式方法多种多样。实践证明，以下五种方法能够普遍推行，效果最好。一、公社设立干部红专学校，每星期上一次至二次生产技术课，由农业技术干部和有经验的农民讲课，课程内容是以“八字宪法”为中心，当前做什么农活就学什么技术。二、向有经验的农民学习。生产队支部书记以上的干部，每月亲自召开一次农民座谈会，以吸取各种生产经验。三、按照季节，定期举办各种技术训练班，轮流组织干部进行技术训练。四、各级干部都参加种试验田。五、精读县委根据本县情况编印的“农历通书”、“农业技术操作规程”两本书；并规定自学时间至少每周有五个小时。
    赣县过去没有种过棉花，今年计划种棉一万六千亩。为了攻破植棉技术关，县委副书记黄德援精读了十多本植棉技术书籍，访问了上十个农业技术干部，之后，又调查了全县各个地区的自然环境，并召集了几次农民座谈会，听取了他们的意见。黄德援经过反复研究，提出了一套关于当地植棉技术措施的意见。按照这些意见做的结果，今年播种的棉花苗与邻县先进植棉区的棉苗长得一样好。
    干部从头到尾熟悉了农作物的生长过程，学到了许多极为有用的生产知识和生产技术，大大提高和增长了他们领导生产的勇气和信心。吉埠公社党委第一书记董力平以前不懂生产技术，对领导公社实现今年生产大跃进缺乏足够的信心。如今，董力平的劲头却越来越大，他和全体社干部、群众经过多次开会讨论、商量，满怀信心地制订了今年继续跃进的计划和实现这个计划的措施。目前，董力平经常同社员一起搞田间管理，力争早稻丰收。　（刘光辉）
    本报贵阳14日电　贵州铜仁县干部学技术已经形成风气。全县四千多名生产队长以上干部，每人都学会了十项以上农业生产技术。对水稻、玉米、小麦和各种杂粮的种植操作技术，一般都能掌握。干部走到田里，已经不是外行的领导者，而是以内行的普通劳动者的姿态领导生产，有力地推动了当前的生产运动。
    干部掌握了一定的农业生产技术以后，领导农业生产更加切实有力。在春耕生产中，这个县已因地制宜地制定了种植水稻、玉米等十二种作物的技术操作规程，研究推广了三百九十多项春播技术，鉴定推广了五十二种、九万多件春耕春播工具，使整地、施肥、播种、插秧等比往年做得扎实细致。在这些生产活动中，干部们不但学到了技术，而且传播了技术。如江口公社党委书记黄荣华，学会了制造几种土化肥后，立即召开了现场会议，在全社推广。随后，县委又组织了两个制造土化肥的技术表演队，在全县范围内巡回表演。
    铜仁县各级干部人人钻技术的风气，是中共铜仁县委会带头开展起来的。在去年大搞技术革新运动中，县委会的领导同志深深体会到领导带头是鼓舞广大群众学技术和全面贯彻执行农业八字宪法的重要关键。县委书记姚洪显同志，在江口公社一年中学会了一百三十多项农业生产技术，从而迅速地打开了干部、群众学技术的局面。县、公社、生产队各级干部，迅速掀起了“人人钻技术，个个懂科学”、“到一处，学一处，做什么、学什么”的热潮。现在，除县委和公社党委成立了技术革新委员会外，管理区、生产队共成立了九十五个技术传授站，一百零四所农业技术夜校，一千三百六十个农业科学研究小组。
