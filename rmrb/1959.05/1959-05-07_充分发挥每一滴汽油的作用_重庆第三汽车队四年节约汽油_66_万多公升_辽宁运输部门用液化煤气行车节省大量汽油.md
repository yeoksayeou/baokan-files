The Third Motor Transport Team in Chongqing Saved Over 660,000 Liters of Gasoline in Four Years
Liaoning Transportation Department Saves Large Amounts of Gasoline by Using Liquefied Petroleum Gas for Vehicles

　　(Our Newspaper Chongqing, 6th) The Chongqing City Motor Transport Company's Third Motor Transport Team has fostered a trend of conserving gasoline. As of April 15th this year, they have saved a total of 665,000 liters of gasoline over the past four years. Calculated according to the current stipulated consumption quota, this batch of gasoline could supply a 4.5-ton truck to travel over 2,512,900 kilometers.
　　This team has 117 ZIS-150 and Jiefang brand trucks. The Party branch of the motor transport team has always attached importance to the conservation of fuel, and regularly educates the employees about saving fuel. The employees also regard saving fuel consumption as one of their daily tasks. They attach importance to learning from the advanced experiences of others in saving gasoline, and apply them specifically to driving.
　　Generally, drivers lack confidence in saving gasoline in winter, believing that more gasoline should be consumed in cold weather. Several leaders of this team earnestly studied the winter fuel consumption and found that the main reason was that the engine could not always maintain a normal temperature. Therefore, the leadership immediately proposed: "Let the car engine live a warm spring life in winter" to save gasoline. As a result, the team saved more than 30,000 liters of gasoline last winter.
　　This team travels all year round in the mountainous areas of Sichuan and Guizhou, without fixed special lines. Wherever there are materials, they are sent to transport goods. The slopes are steep and the bends are sharp, and there are many difficulties. However, this has not affected their efforts to save gasoline. Based on this situation, they sent advanced driving groups and technically skilled drivers to the new routes; and set up stations at the concentration points of the vehicles, and assigned cadres to help the drivers summarize the experience of saving fuel, so that they could quickly become familiar with the new roads and find ways to save fuel.
　　After several years of exploration, the team has now established a number of gasoline-saving systems. The team and the employees have included gasoline saving in the Great Leap Forward plan. The team first improved the fuel quota management work, and handed the quota to the drivers themselves, so that they were all clear about how much fuel was issued, and universally cared about fuel consumption. Every time they drive, they have to calculate the surplus and loss of fuel. Each station also publishes the fuel consumption situation every day, so that everyone knows the situation. Many drivers have made it a habit to save fuel in every aspect of refueling, parking, starting, yielding, reversing, and going uphill and downhill.
　　(Our Newspaper Shenyang, 6th) The Liaoning Province highway transportation department has adopted liquefied petroleum gas to replace gasoline as fuel, saving a lot of gasoline.
　　Liquefied petroleum gas is made by using the by-product of petroleum plants in the gasoline manufacturing process – marsh gas, after low-temperature and high-pressure treatment. In the past, in various petroleum factories, except for a small number of marsh gas that was recovered and used as general fuel, most of it was let run off. In order to turn these "waste products" into useful treasures, the Jinzhou Petroleum Plant No. 6, Jinzhou City Transportation Company, Changchun First Automobile Manufacturing Plant, and Changchun Automobile Research Institute jointly researched and trial-produced liquefied petroleum gas for automobile use, and in April last year, they modified the first liquid gas fuel automobile. Recently, with the help of Petroleum Plant No. 6, Petroleum Plant No. 1 also successfully compressed liquefied petroleum gas from gaseous marsh gas. According to the results of trial use in Fushun and Jinzhou, the vehicle runs normally and performs well. The Fushun City Transportation Company once hitched a trailer to a vehicle fueled by liquefied petroleum gas, loaded six tons of cargo, and conducted round-trip tests between Shenyang and Fushun, which had high slopes along the way, without any problems. They also made a comparison. In the past, this vehicle used 15 kilograms of gasoline per 100 kilometers, and now it only uses 15 kilograms of liquefied petroleum gas, and the automobile carbon residue after the liquefied petroleum gas is burned is less than that of gasoline, which can reduce machine wear and prolong the major and intermediate repair mileage. And the cost of liquefied petroleum gas is only about half that of gasoline.

### 充分发挥每一滴汽油的作用  重庆第三汽车队四年节约汽油66万多公升  辽宁运输部门用液化煤气行车节省大量汽油

　　充分发挥每一滴汽油的作用
    重庆第三汽车队四年节约汽油66万多公升
    辽宁运输部门用液化煤气行车节省大量汽油
    本报重庆6日电　重庆市汽车运输公司第三汽车队职工节约汽油形成风气。到今年4月15日止，四年以来共计节约汽油六十六万五千多公升。按目前规定的消耗定额计算，这批汽油可供一辆载重四吨半的汽车跑二百五十一万二千九百多公里。
    这个车队共有吉斯150型和解放牌货车一百十七辆。汽车队党支部一贯重视油料的节约工作，经常在职工中进行节约油料的教育。职工们也把节约油耗作为自己的日常工作之一。重视学习别人节约汽油的先进经验，并具体应用到行车中去。
    一般的驾驶员对冬季节约汽油缺乏信心，认为冷天应当多消耗些汽油。这个队的几个领导人员切实地研究了冬季油耗，发现主要原因是发动机不能经常保持正常温度，于是，领导方面立即提出建议：要让“汽车发动机在冬季过暖和的春天生活”来节约汽油。结果去年冬季全队节约了三万多公升的汽油。
    这个车队常年奔驰在四川和贵州的山区，没有固定的专线行驶，哪里有物资，就被派往哪里运货。坡陡弯急，困难很多，但，这并没有影响他们节约汽油，他们根据这种情况，把先进行车小组和技术熟练的驾驶人员派到新线路上去；并在汽车集中点上设站，派干部驻点帮助驾驶员总结节约油料的经验，使他们很快熟悉新路，找出节约油料的方法。
    经过几年的摸索，现在全队已建立了若干节约汽油的制度。车队和职工都把节约汽油列入跃进计划内。车队首先改进了油料定额管理工作，把定额交驾驶员自己掌握，使他们都清楚发油的多少，普遍关心油料的消耗。他们每开一次车，都要核算油料的节余和亏损情况。各站并把用油情况天天公布出来，使大家心中有数。许多驾驶人员在加油、停车、起步、让车、倒车和上下坡等环节上处处节约油料，已成为习惯。
    本报沈阳6日电　辽宁省公路运输部门采用液化煤气代替汽油作燃料，节省了大量汽油。
    液化煤气，是利用石油厂在制造汽油过程中产生的副产品——瓦斯气体，经过低温高压处理而成。过去这种瓦斯气体，在各石油工厂中，除少数回收作为一般燃料使用外，绝大部分都跑掉了。为了把这些“废物”变成有用之宝，锦州石油六厂、锦州市运输公司、长春第一汽车制造厂和长春汽车研究所等单位共同研究，试制供汽车使用的液化煤气，并在去年4月改装出第一台液体煤气燃料汽车。最近石油一厂在石油六厂的帮助下，也用气体瓦斯压制液化煤气成功。根据抚顺、锦州两地试用结果证明，汽车行驶情况正常，性能良好。抚顺市运输公司曾把用液化煤气作燃料的汽车挂上拖车，装上六吨货物，在途中有高坡的沈阳、抚顺间进行往返试验，也没有发生任何问题。他们还作了一个比较，过去这台汽车载重跑一百公里要用十五公斤汽油，现在用液化煤气也只用十五公斤，而且液化煤气燃烧后，比汽车残炭少，可以减少机器磨损，延长大修和中修里程。而液化煤气的成本只相当汽油一半左右。
