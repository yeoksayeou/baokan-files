　　A Ewe Produces Nine Lambs in a Year

　　Among a flock of sheep raised by Aji, a member of the Hongzhake People's Commune in Artush County, Kizilsu Kirghiz Autonomous Prefecture, Xinjiang, one ewe produced a total of nine lambs from February of last year to February of this year. This ewe gave birth to twins in February of last year, quadruplets in August, and triplets again on February 13 of this year. This ewe is five years old this year. The reason for such a high reproduction rate is mainly due to good feeding and management, paying attention to selecting alfalfa, wheat straw and other feeds with high nutritional content for feeding; at the same time, timely mating is ensured; if mating is unsuccessful, timely re-mating is carried out.

    一母羊年产九羔
    新疆克孜勒苏柯尔克孜族自治州阿图什县闳扎克人民公社社员阿吉老汉饲养的一群羊中，有一只母羊从去年2月到今年2月，共产了九只羊羔。这只母羊去年2月一次产双羔，8月一次产四羔，今年2月13日又产了三羔。这只母羊今年五岁，繁殖率所以这样高，主要是饲养管理得好，注意选用苜蓿、麦草等营养成分较多的饲料来喂养；同时做到适时配种；没配上时就及时补配。　（据新华社讯）
