Hengshan County, Hunan Province, like other parts of the country, has seen an increase in the demand for packaging materials due to the development of commodity production and the expansion of commodity circulation. For the external transfer of only a few major commodities such as tangerines, red dates, peppers, fresh fish, and eggs, more than 250,000 wooden boxes, more than 340,000 baskets, and more than 45,000 gunny sacks are needed. The production of these packaging supplies requires about 5,000 cubic meters of wood, 230,000 moso bamboo poles, and 130,000 jin of jute. Coupled with the packaging needs of local industrial products, the required quantity is even greater. Under this new situation, Hengshan County promptly paid attention to relying on the masses and widely seeking substitutes to organize production through self-reliance. Under the leadership of the Deputy Secretary of the County Party Committee and the specific leadership of the Minister of Finance and Trade, the director of the County Commercial Bureau took personal charge and designated a manager to specifically handle packaging work. The county organized four technical cadres and more than 700 bamboo weavers to go deep into key areas for roving guidance of production. In the second half of last year alone, 49,000 tangerine baskets and egg baskets were woven in Nanwan, Yanglin, Donghu, Dianmen, Dafeng and other places, basically ensuring the packaging needs of tangerines and eggs.

In organizing the production of packaging materials, there were difficulties, and it was necessary to "break through three barriers": ideological, raw materials, and technical. However, because the County Commercial Bureau paid attention to mobilizing the masses and, through debate, made the masses realize the importance of the production of packaging materials to support national construction, these three barriers were quickly overcome. When there were no raw materials, everyone used small bamboos, various branches, and vines from the mountains to replace them. In order to break through the technical barrier, the County Commercial Bureau sent two cadres to Shantou, Guangdong, to learn from the experience of indigenous production methods. After they returned, a manager took the lead in organizing technical cadres to conduct pilot projects in the Nan Yue Red Flag Paper Mill and the Shiwanzijiao Paper Mill, using small bamboos, rice straw, Vitex negundo, willow branches, tree vines, and tree bark to trial-produce various earthen baskets, grass bags, packaging baskets, ropes, and packaging boxes.

The Nan Yue People's Commune also established a professional team to search for wild raw materials, which went up the mountains to cut substitute raw materials. The commune's supply and marketing cooperative vigorously purchased these wild raw materials and organized the masses to process them in large quantities. According to statistics, in the first quarter of this year, the county found more than 50 kinds of wild plants such as kudzu vine, Wattakaka sinensis, and Vitex negundo. These wild plants were used to process large quantities of grass bags, packaging baskets, and native paper, saving the state a large amount of wood, moso bamboo, and jute, reducing packaging costs, and increasing the cash income of the masses by more than 600,000 yuan.

    衡山县连破三关
    湖南省衡山县和全国各地一样，由于商品生产的发展，商品流通扩大，因而需要的包装用品也增多，仅就广柑、红枣、班椒、鲜鱼、蛋品等几种主要商品的外调，就要木箱二十五万多个、筐篓三十四万多个、麻袋四万五千多条。制做这些包装用品，约需木材五千立方公尺、楠竹二十三万根、麻料十三万斤，再加上地方工业产品的包装，所需数量就更大。在这种新形势下，衡山县及时注意了依靠群众，广泛寻找代用品，自力更生组织生产。他们在县委副书记挂帅，财贸部长具体领导下，由县商业局局长亲自负责，指定一个经理专门抓包装工作。全县组织了四个技术干部、七百多个篾工深入重点地区巡回指导生产，仅去年下半年在南湾、杨林、东湖、店门、大丰等地就编制广柑篓和蛋篓四万九千多个，基本上保证了广柑、蛋品的包装需要。
    在组织包装材料生产中不是没有困难的，需要“突破三关”：思想关、原材料关、技术关。但是由于县商业局注意发动群众，通过辩论，使群众认清了包装材料的生产对支援国家建设的重要意义，这三关都很快渡过了。没有原材料，大家就利用山区的小竹子、各种树枝、树藤代替。为了突破技术关，县商业局派了两个干部去广东汕头学习土法生产经验，回来由一个经理带头组织技术干部在南岳红旗纸厂和石湾甲枣纸厂搞试点，利用小竹子、稻草、黄荆条、柳条、树藤、树皮试制成各种土箕、草袋、包装篓、绳索，以及包装箱等。
    南岳人民公社还成立了寻找野生原料专业队，分头上山砍伐代用原料。公社供销部对这些野生原料进行大力收购，组织群众大量加工。据统计，今年第一季度全县共找到葛藤、瓦子藤、黄荆条等野生植物五十多种。用这些野生植物加工出大批草袋、包装篓、土纸等，为国家节省了大量的木材、楠竹、麻料，降低了包袋成本，还为群众增加了六十多万元的现金收入。
