    Visiting the Site of the First National Congress of the Communist Party of China
    Li Jiyie
    With a cannon's roar, the land of China was shaken, and the October light shone on the stars. The meeting was interrupted by sudden storms, and they hastily boarded a small boat.

    For two hundred years, the old country suffered many disasters, and countless heroes died for the cause. The removal of the three mountains was yet to come, and the strategies were decided in that small building in those years.

    The land of China is seething with vitality and new splendor, and the spark has indeed started a prairie fire. The Long March was a great feat that stabilized the overall situation, and the workers and peasants joined hands to establish a new world.

    访第一次党代表大会会址
    李霁野
    一炮声一响震神州，十月光芒射斗牛。议事未终风雨急，匆匆又上小鱼舟。
    二百年故国多灾险，殉难英雄数万千。拔除三山终有待，小楼定策想当年。
    三神州鼎沸物华新，星火燎原事果真。壮举长征安大局，工农携手定乾坤。
