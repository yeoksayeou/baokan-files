Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, May 21st: According to a report by the Vietnam News Agency today, Kantay Siphandone, the Deputy Head of the Former Lao Fighting Forces Military Delegation, who participated in negotiations with the Lao Kingdom Government in 1957, issued a statement on the Lao situation on the 20th, demanding that the Lao government immediately cease its actions of provoking civil war and fulfill the Geneva Accords. The full text of the statement is as follows:

Since the government of Phoui Sananikone came to power, under the instigation of US imperialism, the Geneva Accords on Laos and the agreements jointly signed by the Lao Kingdom Government and the Former Lao Fighting Forces have been seriously violated by the Lao Kingdom Government.

In recent days, the situation in Laos has developed to an extremely serious point. The Phoui Sananikone government has ordered the encirclement and threatening of the Former Lao Fighting Forces, cut off their supply lines, forced them to disarm, and simultaneously sent troops and police to encircle and closely control the leaders of the Former Lao Fighting Forces, including Prince Souphanouvong. The Phoui Sananikone government’s offensive against the Former Lao Fighting Forces signifies its blatant attempt to provoke a civil war in Laos.

Currently, the situations in Xieng Khouang, the Plains, and Xieng Khouang Province are particularly serious. The Phoui Sananikone government has concentrated a large number of troops in the aforementioned areas, preparing to attack the Former Lao Fighting Forces.

It must be reiterated that, according to the military agreement jointly signed by both parties, the merging of the armed forces of the Former Lao Fighting Forces with the Lao Royal Army must be based on the principle of equal rights (Article 2 of the military agreement). However, the Phoui Sananikone government not only fails to abide by this provision, but also does everything possible to undermine it, attacking and attempting to eliminate the armed forces of the Former Lao Fighting Forces.

The agreement on incorporating the Former Lao Fighting Forces into the Royal Army, as well as the agreement reached between the Former Lao Fighting Forces and the Lao Kingdom Government on political issues, were all aimed at achieving national harmony and national unity, enabling Laos to achieve peace, unity, and independence, so as to satisfy the aspirations of all strata of the Lao people. This demonstrates the goodwill of the Former Lao Fighting Forces, led by Prince Souphanouvong, and the current Lao Patriotic Front, for the nation and the motherland, and thus has gained the sympathy and support of the Lao people and the people of the world.

In the face of the current very tense and serious situation, the Lao people make the following firm demands to the Phoui Sananikone government: it must immediately cease actions aimed at attacking the Former Lao Fighting Forces and provoking civil war in Laos, immediately abandon the conspiracy to disarm the Former Lao Fighting Forces, and immediately withdraw the Lao Royal Army that is encircling the Former Lao Fighting Forces, cutting off their supply lines, and proceeding to attack them;

It must immediately withdraw the Lao Royal Army and police who are controlling the leaders of the Former Lao Fighting Forces, including Prince Souphanouvong, who reside in Vientiane, and the cadres of the Former Lao Fighting Forces who reside in various locations, and immediately release the cadres of the Lao Fighting Forces who have been illegally arrested and held in custody in various provinces;

It must earnestly fulfill the Geneva Accords and the agreements signed by both parties;

It must allow the International Commission for Laos to resume its activities;

The Phoui Sananikone government must immediately cease its actions of launching a civil war, and resolve all disputes through peaceful consultation between the two parties.

If the Phoui Sananikone government continues to persist in its actions that violate agreements, oppose the people, and provoke civil war in Laos, then the Phoui Sananikone government must bear full responsibility for the serious consequences it has caused.

The Lao people have been and will continue to wage a resolute struggle to ensure that the Geneva Accords on Laos and the various agreements signed by the Lao Kingdom Government and the Former Lao Fighting Forces are thoroughly implemented. The Former Lao Fighting Forces and the Lao Patriotic Front, under the leadership of Prince Souphanouvong, as well as the entire Lao people, declare that their own position is: to unite all the people, to achieve national harmony, to unite the country, to support the King, to uphold religion, and to safeguard the constitution, so that Laos can truly become a peaceful, neutral, independent, democratic, and strong country.

    前寮国战斗部队军事代表团副团长发表声明
    老挝政府必须停止发动内战
    要求立即撤走管制苏发努冯等人的军警并释放被捕干部
    新华社河内21日电　据越南通讯社今天报道：在1957年同老挝王国政府进行谈判的前寮国战斗部队军事代表团副团长坎代·西班顿20日就老挝局势发表声明，要求老挝政府立即停止挑起内战的行为，履行日内瓦协议。声明全文如下：
    自从培·萨纳尼空政府执政以来，由于美帝国主义的唆使，关于老挝的日内瓦协议和老挝王国政府同前寮国战斗部队共同签订的协议正在遭到老挝王国政府的严重破坏。
    近日来，老挝的局势已经发展到极其严重的地步。培·萨纳尼空政府下令包围和威胁前寮国战斗部队，切断了他们的接济来源，强迫他们解除武装，同时派军队和警察包围和严密管制包括苏发努冯亲王在内的前寮国战斗部队的领袖。培·萨纳尼空政府向前寮国战斗部队发动的进攻意味着它公然企图挑起老挝的内战。
    目前，镇宁、平原和川圹的局势特别严重。培·萨纳尼空政府在上述地区集中了大量兵力，准备进攻前寮国战斗部队。
    必须重申，根据双方共同签订的军事协议，前寮国战斗部队的武装力量同老挝王国军队的合并必须建立在权利平等的原则上（军事协议第二条）。但是，培·萨纳尼空政府不但不遵守这个规定，而且千方百计地破坏这个规定，它进攻和企图消灭前寮国战斗部队的武装力量。
    关于把前寮国战斗部队并入王国军队的协议以及前寮国战斗部队同老挝王国政府之间就政治问题达成的协议，都是为了实现民族和睦和国家统一，使老挝能够获致和平、统一和独立，以满足老挝各阶层人民的愿望。这表明了以苏发努冯亲王为首的前寮国战斗部队和目前的老挝爱国党为民族、为祖国着想的善意，因而得到老挝人民和世界人民的同情和支持。
    面对当前非常紧张和严重的局势，老挝人民向培·萨纳尼空政府提出以下的坚决要求：必须立即停止目的在于进攻前寮国战斗部队和挑起老挝内战的行为，立即放弃企图解除前寮国战斗部队的武装的阴谋，立即撤走正在包围前寮国战斗部队、切断他们的接济来源并且进而进攻他们的老挝王国军队；
    必须立即撤走正在管制住在万象的苏发努冯亲王等前寮国战斗部队领导人和住在各地的前寮国战斗部队的干部的老挝王国军队和警察，立即释放在各省被非法逮捕和被集中看管的寮国战斗部队的干部；
    必须严正履行日内瓦协议和双方签订的协议；
    必须让老挝国际委员会恢复它的活动；
    培·萨纳尼空政府必须立即停止发动内战的行动，由双方通过和平协商的方式解决一切争端。
    培·萨纳尼空政府如果继续坚持它的违反协议、反对人民、挑起老挝内战的行为，那么，培·萨纳尼空政府就必须对它所造成的严重后果负全部责任。
    老挝人民已经并且将要继续进行坚决的斗争，以保证关于老挝的日内瓦协议以及老挝王国政府同前寮国战斗部队签订的各项协议得到彻底的履行。在苏发努冯亲王领导下的前寮国战斗部队和老挝爱国党以及老挝全体人民申明，他们自己的立场是：团结全体人民，实现民族和睦，统一国家，拥护国王，拥护宗教，维护宪法，以便使老挝真正成为一个和平、中立、独立、民主和强盛的国家。
