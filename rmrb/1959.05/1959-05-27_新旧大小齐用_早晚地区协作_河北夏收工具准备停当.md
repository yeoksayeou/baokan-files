Combining New and Old, Large and Small, Coordinating Early and Late Regions
Hebei's Summer Harvest Tool Preparations are Ready

Tianjin, May 26th (this newspaper) – Hebei Province is using a method that combines large, small, new, and old tools, and is implementing province-wide cooperation to effectively solve the summer harvest tool problem. Currently, areas in northern Hebei such as Zhangjiakou, Chengde, Baoding, and Tianjin, where the wheat harvest season is later, are transporting combine harvesters, reaper-binders, tractors, threshers, and other equipment to Handan, Shijiazhuang prefectures, and southern Tianjin, where the wheat harvest season is earlier, in preparation for harvesting wheat. Various localities have also trial-produced new types of agricultural implements with higher work efficiency, such as animal-powered harvesters and grain reapers, and have repaired and added a large number of new and old small harvesting tools, totaling more than 3.9 million pieces.

When preparing summer harvest tools, Hebei Province not only advocates the simultaneous use of large, small, new, and old tools, but also emphasizes small tools as the foundation, requiring each labor force to have a tool. The cities of Tianjin and Handan have designated more than 8,060 factories to prepare small tools for the summer harvest. The workers in these factories have manufactured more than 400 new types of tools such as grain reapers and horse-drawn harvesters, and have repaired and newly manufactured more than 2.58 million pieces of small tools such as scythes, wooden shovels, and wooden rakes. In the work of preparing tools, various localities, in order to save raw materials, adopted the method of "checking, supplementing, digging, and searching" to clean up and repair agricultural tools scattered in the homes of commune members, and mobilized commune members to take out useful idle tools, which the communes borrowed with compensation, or purchased from other places. Nine counties including Hejian, Wuqing, and Baxian used the method of checking and supplementing to solve the problem of more than 3.19 million small agricultural tools. Shuangwang Commune in Changli County organized a shock team composed of 26 blacksmiths and carpenters to process and repair agricultural tools, and went deep into 47 production teams to carry out processing and repair work. In just ten days, they repaired more than 3,700 various tools such as vehicles and scythes.

In order to give full play to the role of large-scale machinery and achieve the requirements of fast and good harvesting, large-scale cooperation was implemented in the use of machinery. During the summer harvest season, 4,028 combine harvesters, reaper-binders, harvester-windrowers, and threshers were put into operation. Calculated on the basis of harvesting machinery working for seven days and threshing machinery working for ten days, more than 3.21 million mu can be harvested and more than 1.32 billion jin can be threshed, accounting for 10% to 14% of the province's total wheat area. Around the end of May to the beginning of June, Handan, Baoding, and Shijiazhuang prefectures will enter the harvesting stage. These areas have more wheat fields and an earlier season. Two hundred and fourteen combine harvesters, reaper-binders, and threshers were transferred from the three prefectures of Zhangjiakou, Chengde, and Baoding in the north to support Handan, Shijiazhuang, and southern Tianjin; Tianjin also dispatched 30 tractors to support Baoding Prefecture and 38 combine harvesters to support Handan Prefecture; the supporting machinery has now been dispatched. Three hundred and fifty students from Shijiazhuang Mechanization School and ninety students from Beijing Agricultural Mechanization College who were sent down for internship also went to various places to help local communes receive machinery and prepare to participate in the intense summer harvest battle.

    新旧大小齐用  早晚地区协作
    河北夏收工具准备停当
    本报天津26日电  河北省以大、小、新、旧同时并举的办法，准备夏收工具，并实行全省范围的大协作，有效地解决了夏收工具问题。现在，这个省北部张家口、承德、保定及天津市等麦收季节较晚的地区，正在把联合收割机、割捆机、拖拉机、脱粒机等源源运往麦收季节较早的邯郸、石家庄专区及天津市南部地区，准备收割小麦。各地还试制了畜力收割机、割禾器等工效较高的新式农具，修理、添置了大量的新、旧小型收割工具三百九十多万件。
    河北省在准备夏收工具的时候，既提倡大、小、新、旧同时并举，又强调以小型为基础，要求各地每个劳动力都有一件工具。天津、邯郸两个市指定了八千零六十多个工厂，为夏收准备小型工具，这些工厂的职工制造了割禾器、马拉收割机等新型工具四百多件，修理和新制了镰刀、木锨、木扒、等小工具二百五十八万多件。各地在准备工具工作中，为了节省原料，采用“查、补、挖、找”的办法，对散存社员家中的农具进行了清理、修补，发动社员拿出有用的闲弃工具，公社付酬借用，或到外地去采购。河间、武清、坝县等九个县用查、补的办法，就解决了小农具三百一十九万多件。昌黎县双望公社组织了一支由二十六个铁匠、木匠组成的农具加工、修理突击队，深入到四十七个生产队进行加工、修理工作，只十天时间，就修好车辆、镰刀等各种工具三千七百多件。
    为充分发挥大型机械的作用，达到收快、收好的要求，在机械使用上，实行了大协作。在夏收季节里，投入收割的联合收割机、割捆机、割晒机、脱粒机四千零二十八台。以收割机械工作七天，脱粒机械工作十天计算，可收割三百二十一万多亩，脱粒十三亿二千多万斤，可占全省小麦总面积的百分之十到十四。5月末到6月初前后，邯郸、保定、石家庄三专区就要进入收割阶段。这里麦田多，季节早，从北部张家口、承德、保定三个专区调出联合收割机、割捆机、脱粒机二百十四台，分别支援邯郸、石家庄及天津市南部地区；天津市又抽出拖拉机三十台支援保定专区，三十八台联合收割机支援邯郸专区；现在各地支援机械已经启运。石家庄机械化学校三百五十名学生和北京农业机械化学院下放实习的九十名学生也分赴各地，帮助当地公社接收机械，准备投入紧张的夏收战斗。                （谷克东）（附图片）
