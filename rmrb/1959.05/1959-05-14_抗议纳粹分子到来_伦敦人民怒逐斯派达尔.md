    Protesting the Arrival of Nazis
    Londoners Angrily Expel Speidel
    Xinhua News Agency, London, May 12th: Hans Speidel, the former Chief of Staff to Nazi German Field Marshal Rommel and current Commander of NATO's Central European Ground Forces, arrived in London on the evening of May 11th to attend a grand banquet held by the British Royal Family to commemorate the tenth anniversary of the founding of NATO. However, as he was heading to the London Chamber of Commerce Hall for the banquet, he saw a nine-foot-long and four-foot-wide banner that read "Nazi Speidel Get Out!" The banner was unfurled as he passed by.
    This morning, the British authorities fined four people, allegedly responsible for unfurling the banner, five pounds each. Their crime was: committing "disorderly conduct likely to cause a breach of the peace." The judge said when issuing the fine: "We all have our passions, but you cannot let your passions control you as you did last night."
    Police admitted that the crowd watching nearby applauded enthusiastically when they saw the banner.
    One of those fined said to the judge: "As a disabled veteran, I am extremely angry that a man who received the Hitler Decoration for faithfully serving Hitler has been invited to Britain to become a distinguished guest of the Chamber of Commerce Hall."

    抗议纳粹分子到来
    伦敦人民怒逐斯派达尔
    新华社伦敦12日电  曾经担任纳粹德国元帅隆美尔的参谋长的北大西洋集团驻中欧地面部队总司令汉斯·斯派达尔11日晚间到达伦敦，前来参加英国皇室为纪念北大西洋集团成立十周年而举行的盛大宴会。但是，当他前往伦敦商会大厅赴宴时，他在路上看到了一幅写着“纳粹分子斯派达尔滚出去！”的九英尺长、四英尺宽的横幅标语，这幅标语是在他走过时打开的。
    今天上午，英国当局对于据说应对展开这个横幅标语负责的四个人分别罚款五英镑。他们的罪名是：作出“可能妨害治安的无礼行为”。法官在判处罚款时说：“我们大家都有自己的激情，但是不能像你们昨晚所做的那样，让你们的激情控制了你们。”
    警察承认，在旁边观看的群众看到这幅标语时曾热烈鼓掌。
    被罚款的一个人对法官说：“作为一个残废军人，我对于因为忠心地为希特勒效劳而得到希特勒勋章的人竟被请来英国，成为商会厅的贵宾，感到十分愤怒。”
