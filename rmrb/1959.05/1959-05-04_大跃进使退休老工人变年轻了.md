    Comrade Chairman, fellow committee members:
    I fully endorse Premier Zhou's government work report and the reports of the leading comrades. Hearing these reports has been truly exhilarating. I deeply feel that our country, under the brilliant leadership of the great Chinese Communist Party and our most beloved Chairman Mao, is leaping forward.
    I am an old worker from the Jiangnan Shipyard in Shanghai, where I worked and lived for thirty-four years. Due to my age, I retired last year, enjoying the benefits of labor insurance and living a happy and fulfilling life in my old age.
    Before liberation, the Jiangnan Shipyard was a dilapidated old factory, severely damaged by the Kuomintang reactionaries. After liberation, under the leadership of the Party, all the factory workers restored and transformed this dilapidated factory. Over the years, production capacity has continuously improved, new types of work have been added, and the factory has continued to expand. Especially during the Great Leap Forward last year, there was a great leap in production. Through the rectification campaign, the "double opposition" movement, and the anti-rightist struggle, the political enthusiasm and production enthusiasm of the workers have greatly increased. During the "double opposition" movement, the workers in our factory posted more than 500,000 big-character posters, effectively opposing conservative thinking and overcoming waste. Under the shining light of the Party's General Line of "going all out, aiming high, and achieving greater, faster, better, and more economical results in building socialism," all the factory workers were filled with enthusiasm. For example, when building the 5,000-ton ocean freighter (Peace No. 28), the original plan was to complete it in eighteen months. After repeated discussions by the workers, they decided to complete it ahead of schedule and launched a friendly competition with the Dalian Shipyard, which was building the Peace No. 25 ocean freighter at the time. In the end, they successfully completed the task of building the Peace No. 28 5,000-ton ocean freighter in five months and twelve days. This was unprecedented in China's shipbuilding history. In the third quarter of last year, during the battle for steel, all the factory workers put forward the fighting slogan of "Everything for steel, only with steel can we have ships." In the face of insufficient labor, they vigorously launched mass movements and technical innovation and technical revolution. The workers said well: "Shipbuilding heroes are not afraid of difficulties, the heavier the task, the better, everything depends on human effort, and pressure breeds heroes." From the bottom of our hearts, we sang this poem: "Working thinking of steel, targets going higher, walking thinking of steel, strength all over the body, sleeping thinking of steel, joyful dreams, eating thinking of steel, food is fragrant and delicious." That's how we successfully completed the task of steelmaking equipment last year, while also completing the ship repair and building plan.
    Although I have retired, for decades, the factory has been my home. The Great Leap Forward has made us retired workers younger. I and a dozen other retired old workers also participated in steelmaking work, some helping workers' families with sideline production, some training apprentices, and doing some light work to repay the care and attention of the Party and the government for us.
    This year, the production of our factory has improved compared to last year, and the cycle of ship repair and building has been shortened compared to last year. This year's task will definitely be completed and can be overfulfilled. This year will be a leap on the basis of last year's leap.
    Speaking of life, I have even deeper feelings. In the old society, we workers suffered from imperialist aggression and the exploitation and oppression of the Kuomintang reactionaries. We could not support our wives, children, and old parents, and lived a life worse than beasts of burden. After liberation, under the wise leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, we workers became masters of the country. Our work is fully guaranteed, and our lives are improved and enhanced every year. In particular, the Party and the government have given meticulous care and attention to old workers. Take me as an example, although I enjoy labor insurance, my income is still considerable now. Both of my sons are architectural engineering technicians, and they live very well. Compared with the old society, it is a world of difference, fundamentally different. Now, not only has our lives been greatly improved and enhanced, but the social status and political treatment of workers have also been greatly improved. Like me, an ordinary worker, I participated in the first National People's Political Consultative Conference after liberation, and I am still a member of the CPPCC to this day. The Party, the people, and the worker brothers have given me such high honor, which makes me very grateful. At the same time, I also feel ashamed. I love the Party and Chairman Mao from the bottom of my heart.
    Now, a small handful of reactionary elements in Tibet, under the conspiracy, manipulation, and instigation of foreign reactionaries, want to split Tibet from our motherland, which makes me feel extremely indignant. Tibet will always be China's Tibet, and no foreigners are ever allowed to interfere. If imperialism attempts to bully us, our working class will raise our iron fists and beat them until their heads are broken and bleeding. I wish the conference a complete success and all the members good health.

### 大跃进使退休老工人变年轻了

    大跃进使退休老工人变年轻了
    李时良委员的发言主席、各位委员：
    我完全拥护周总理所作政府工作报告和各位首长的报告。听了这些报告以后真是叫人高兴极啦，我深深体会到，我们的国家在伟大的中国共产党和我们最亲爱的毛主席的英明领导下，正在飞跃前进。
    我是上海江南造船厂的一个老工人，我在厂里工作和生活了三十四年。因为年纪大了，去年已经退休，享受着劳动保险的待遇，快乐和幸福地过着我这老年生活。
    解放以前，江南造船厂是一个破破烂烂的老厂子，并且遭到国民党反动派的严重破坏，解放以后，全厂职工在党的领导下，把这样一个不像样的老厂，进行了恢复与改造。几年来，生产能力不断提高，新工种不断增加，工厂不断扩大，特别是在去年的生产大跃进中，生产上有了很大的跃进。通过整风、双反运动和反右派斗争，职工的政治热情和生产热情，大大高涨。在双反运动中，我们厂里的职工同志共贴出了五十多万张大字报，有效地反对保守思想，克服浪费现象。在党的鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义总路线的光辉照耀下，全厂职工干劲冲天，举一个例，在建造五千吨海轮（和平二十八号）时，原订计划是十八个月完成，经过工人一再讨论，提前并且和当时大连造船厂建造的和平二十五号海轮开展友谊竞赛，最后以五个月零十二天胜利地完成建造和平二十八号五千吨海轮的任务。这在我国造船史上是从来没有的。去年第三季度，在为钢而战中，我们全厂职工提出了“一切为了钢，有钢才有船”的战斗口号，在劳动力不足的情况下，大搞群众运动，大闹技术革新和技术革命。职工群众说得好：“造船英雄不怕难，任务越重越好办，事在人为有大志，压力下面出好汉。”我们从心底里唱出了这样一首诗歌：“干活想着钢，指标往上长，走路想着钢，混身力量强，睡觉想着钢，梦里喜洋洋，吃饭想着钢，饭菜香又香。”就是这样，我们去年胜利地完成了炼钢设备的任务。同时完成修造船的计划。
    我虽然已经退休了，几十年来，工厂就是我的家，大跃进使我们这些退休的工人变得年轻起来，我和十几位退休的老工人也参加了炼钢工作，有的帮助职工家属搞副业生产，有的培训艺徒，做些轻便的工作，来报答党和政府对我们的关怀和照顾。
    今年我厂在生产上比去年又有提高，修造船的周期比去年又有缩短，今年的任务一定可以完成，并且能够超额完成。今年将在去年的跃进基础上，跃进再跃进。
      谈起生活来，我有更深的体会。在旧社会，我们工人受尽了帝国主义的侵略，受尽了国民党反动派的剥削和压迫，妻儿老小养不活，过着牛马不如的生活。解放以后，在党和毛主席的英明领导下，我们工人当了国家的主人，工作得到充分的保障，生活每年都得到改善和提高。特别是党和政府对老工人更是无微不至的关怀和照顾。拿我来说吧，我虽然享受劳保，现在收入仍然不少，两个儿子都是建筑工程技术人员，生活得很好，与旧社会比起来，真是天上地下，有着根本的不同。现在我们不仅生活上得到大大地改善和提高，而且工人的社会地位和政治待遇也大大的提高，像我这样一个普通的工人，解放后，第一次全国政协会议我就参加了，并且一直到现在我仍是政协委员。党和人民以及工人兄弟给我这样高的荣誉，真使我感激。同时自己也感到惭愧，我从心眼里热爱党，热爱毛主席。
    现在西藏一小撮反动分子，在外国反动派的阴谋操纵指使之下，想把西藏从我们祖国分裂出去，使我感到无比愤慨。西藏永远是中国的西藏，永远不许任何外国人干涉。帝国主义如果妄图欺侮我们，我们工人阶级将高举铁拳，把它打得头破血流。敬祝大会胜利成功，各位委员身体健康。
