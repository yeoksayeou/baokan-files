Carefully Cultivate Orchards to Ensure a Bumper Harvest of Fruits
National Fruit Tree On-Site Conference Proposes Six Measures to Increase Production

(Our report) The peasants in China's vast fruit-producing areas are working diligently in the vibrant orchards, striving to make every fruit tree strong, every tree produce abundantly, and every fruit large and plump, to achieve a large-scale bumper harvest of fruits this year.

The slogan of launching a large-scale bumper fruit tree production campaign was put forward by the Ministry of Agriculture at the National Fruit Tree On-Site Conference held in Lankao County, Henan Province, not long ago. Last year, the total fruit production in the country increased by 32.2% compared to the previous year, and many high-yield orchards emerged. Last year, more than one-seventh of the country's citrus orchards (referring to fruit-bearing orange trees) achieved a yield of more than 2,000 catties per mu; many famous banana-producing areas in Guangdong Province and famous pear-producing areas such as Jiaohe in Hebei and Yuanping in Shanxi Province achieved large-scale bumper harvests last year. After summarizing these high-yield achievements and experiences, the National Fruit Tree On-Site Conference believes that it is entirely possible to launch a large-scale bumper fruit tree production campaign this year and create more high-yield orchards with yields of 5,000 catties or 10,000 catties per mu. Many fruit-producing areas began preparations for striving for a large-scale bumper fruit tree harvest this year very early. From last autumn to this spring, nurseries across the country transferred more than 300 million fruit tree seedlings to support the expansion or establishment of orchards in various places, including more than 100 million seedlings of major fruits such as apples and citrus. Many fruit-producing areas have also trained a large number of fruit tree production technicians and summarized and disseminated the experiences of large-scale high yields and promoting early and abundant fruit production. Since the beginning of spring, China's famous fruit-producing areas have also paid special attention to the production of famous products. This year, the bananas in the Pearl River Delta, the honey peaches in Feicheng, Shandong, the snow pears in Cangxi, Sichuan, and the seedless grapes in Xinjiang are all being cultivated very well.

The fruit farmers and garden workers in Henan, Anhui, Jiangsu, and Shandong provinces are carefully cultivating the apple, grape, peach, and jujube trees newly planted in the old course of the Yellow River last year. Now, in these areas, in more than 2 million mu of new orchards, some of the early-planted fruit trees have already begun to blossom and bear fruit.

In order to effectively launch a large-scale bumper fruit tree production campaign, the "Six Major Initiatives for Fruit Tree Production" proposed by the National Fruit Tree On-Site Conference to farmers in various fruit-producing areas emphasized several measures to increase production. These measures are: First, conscientiously implement the Eight-Point Charter for Agriculture, and adopt measures such as applying sufficient base fertilizer, multiple top dressings, foliar spraying, intercropping green manure, loosening soil to conserve moisture, storing water for irrigation, and preventing floods and draining waterlogging to achieve water conservancy in orchards, so that fruit trees can "eat their fill and drink their fill"; vigorously carry out deep plowing, improve the soil, and increase soil fertility; vigorously prevent and control plant diseases and insect pests, requiring more counties and cities to achieve orchards free of plant diseases and insect pests; do a good job in pruning and fine management to achieve flower preservation, fruit preservation, and large and plump fruits. Second, unify planning, comprehensively arrange, gradually realize the landscaping of the land, vigorously develop modern new orchards, and at the same time use gaps to plant fruit trees. Require good planting quality, high survival rate, and strengthen the management of young trees to achieve vigorous growth and early high yield. Third, do everything possible to tap the potential of seeds and seedlings, vigorously carry out rapid seedling cultivation, strive for seedlings to be out of the nursery in the same year, and achieve a large number of fruit seedlings, good varieties, and high quality. Fourth, combine indigenous and foreign methods, vigorously engage in technical revolution, summarize and promote advanced experience, and carry out a tool reform campaign centered on improving the labor efficiency of deep plowing, digging holes, disease and insect control, and seedling cultivation. Fifth, put politics in command, vigorously launch mass movements, and carry out socialist labor competitions to compare with, catch up with, and surpass advanced workers. Establish professional organizations, improve the technical network, and assign tasks to teams, responsibilities to individuals, and technology to orchards.

Now, farmers in various fruit-producing areas are working hard to implement these measures. (Attached picture)

### 精心培育果园　保证果品丰收  全国果树现场会议提出六项增产措施

　　精心培育果园　保证果品丰收
    全国果树现场会议提出六项增产措施
    本报讯　我国广大果区的农民们正在万紫千红的果园里辛勤地劳动着，他们力争果树棵棵健壮，株株丰产，果实个个肥大，实现今年水果大面积丰产。
    开展果树大面积丰产运动的口号，是农业部不久以前在河南兰考县召开的全国果树现场会议提出来的。去年，全国水果的总产量比前年增长了32.2％，出现了许多丰产果园。全国约有七分之一以上的柑桔园（指结果桔树）去年达到了亩产两千多斤；广东省许多著名的香蕉产地、河北交河、山西原平等著名的梨产地去年都获得了大面积丰产。全国果树现场会议总结了这些丰产成就和丰产经验以后，认为今年开展果树大面积丰产运动，出现更多的亩产五千斤、一万斤的丰产果园是完全可能的。许多果区很早就开始了争取今年果树大面积丰产的准备工作。自去秋至今春，全国苗圃移出的果树幼苗有三亿多株，支援各地扩大或建立果园，其中有一亿多株是苹果和柑桔等主要水果树苗。许多果区还训练了大批的果树生产技术人员，总结和传播了大面积丰产和促使果树早丰产、多结果的经验。入春以来，我国各著名水果产区还特别注意了名产品的生产，今年，珠江三角洲的香蕉、山东肥城的蜜桃、四川苍溪的雪梨、新疆的无核葡萄，都培育得很好。
    河南、安徽、江苏、山东四省的果农和园艺场的职工们正在细心培育去年在黄河故道中新栽的苹果、葡萄、桃、枣等果树。现在，这些地区二百多万亩新果园中，有些早栽的果树已经开花结果了。
    为了切切实实开展果树大面积丰产运动，全国果树现场会议向各地果区农民提出的“果树生产六大倡议”中，着重提出了几项增产措施。这些措施是：一、认真贯彻农业八字宪法，采取施足基肥、多次追肥、根外喷肥、间作绿肥、松土保墒、蓄水灌溉、防洪排涝等办法实现果园水利化，让果树“吃饱喝足”；大搞深耕，改良土壤，提高地力；大力防治病虫害，要求更多的县、市作到果园无病虫害；作好整枝修剪，精细管理，达到保花、保果，果实个个肥大。二、统一规划、全面安排，逐步实现大地园林化，大力发展现代化新果园，同时利用空隙地栽植果树。要求作到种植质量好，成活率高，加强幼树管理，达到生长旺，早丰产。三、千方百计挖掘种苗潜力，大搞快速育苗，争取当年出圃，作到果苗数量多、品种好、质量高。四、土洋结合，大闹技术革命，总结推广先进经验，开展以提高深耕、挖穴、病虫防治、苗木培育等劳动效率为中心的工具改革运动。五、政治挂帅，大搞群众运动，开展比先进、赶先进、超先进的社会主义劳动竞赛。建立专业组织，健全技术网，作到任务到队，责任到人，技术到园。
    现在各地果区农民正在为贯彻这些措施而努力。（附图片）
