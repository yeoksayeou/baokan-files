Representatives Ke Lin, Liang Boqiang, and Xie Zhiguang Discuss the Achievements of Zhongshan Medical College Last Year

We fully agree with and support Premier Zhou Enlai's Government Work Report, Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the draft 1959 National Economic Plan, Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1958 State Final Accounts and the 1959 State Budget (draft), and Vice Chairman Peng Zhen's report on the work of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. We will resolutely implement them in our future work.

Last year was a year of great leap forward for our country, a year of brilliant achievements in various socialist construction endeavors. On the scientific and cultural front, medical education, like other undertakings, under the correct leadership of the Party and the brilliant illumination of the general line for socialist construction, following the principle of "the whole country as a coordinated chess game" and "walking on two legs," also took a great leap forward, and is now advancing with even more vigorous strides.

We can affirm that due to the rapid development of the national economy and the continuous improvement of the people's demands for material and cultural life, all undertakings must continue to leap forward, surpassing each year, in order to meet the people's aspirations.

We are engaged in medical education, and our current task is to do everything possible to improve this year's medical education work and strive for a greater leap forward to meet the people's aspirations.

Based on our years of experience in our positions, especially the initial experience of last year's education revolution, we have the following immature understandings:

I. Last year's leap forward and development in the national medical education事业 was achieved under the circumstances of the great victory of the anti-rightist struggle and rectification campaign, the strengthening of the Party's leadership, putting politics in command, following the mass line, and resolutely implementing the policy of "education serving proletarian politics" and "education combined with productive labor."

Medical colleges, like other institutions of higher learning, are places where intellectuals congregate. Establishing and consolidating the Party's leadership, implementing the Party's policy of uniting, transforming, and educating intellectuals, and making them serve the working class and socialist construction are always the most important goals. Taking our Zhongshan Medical College as an example, after a series of movements such as the anti-rightist struggle, rectification campaign, great blooming and contending, red and expert debates, and teaching reform, bourgeois individualism was discredited, bourgeois academic thought was criticized, and the relationship between politics and professional work was resolved. Teachers, students, and staff have undergone profound changes and a certain degree of progress in their political thinking. Some have changed their class stance and become working-class intellectuals, while some in the middle have moved to the left to varying degrees. Now, in general, teachers, students, and staff can accept the Party's leadership in politics and professional work, work actively and diligently, and carry out teaching, scientific research, and medical work under the leadership of the Party and in accordance with plans. For example, in the medical work of our affiliated hospitals, when the Party called for all-out efforts to rescue steelmaking burn victims, medical staff shouted the moving slogan "We'll give blood if you need blood!" "We'll give skin if you need skin!" Everyone worked tirelessly, day and night, wholeheartedly treating the injured. Professors and experts also put aside their airs and delivered soup and medicine to the sick and injured, treating patients like family members. In order to popularize medical education, train a large number of senior health personnel, and support the establishment of medical college branches in various special districts, professors, lecturers, assistants, and technicians of our college unconditionally accepted assignments. Last year, Zhongshan Medical College opened three branch colleges and three medical vocational schools. Last winter, in order to cooperate with the rectification and consolidation of the people's communes, our college, according to the instructions of the Provincial Party Committee, quickly dispatched a total of 1,200 teachers, doctors, nurses, and senior students to various counties and cities in the Jiangmen and Zhanjiang special districts and to reservoir construction sites to conduct epidemic prevention, patriotic health campaigns, and training of grassroots health cadres, all of which achieved great results. The above situation is not only true in our college, but also in medical colleges across the country. All this proves that with the correct leadership of the Party, putting politics in command, and the raising of the political and ideological awareness of intellectuals, teaching, medical care, epidemic prevention, and all kinds of work can be carried out smoothly and make great leaps forward.

Therefore, we deeply feel that the unity and transformation of intellectuals is very important. When carrying out this work, we must make specific analyses, treat them differently, and be thorough and meticulous. We must first understand them and understand their political and ideological situation and their professional work. Differentiate between what belongs to the scope of political issues, what belongs to the scope of ideological issues, what belongs to the scope of academic thought, and what belongs to the scope of lifestyle. Only when the situation is clear can we be targeted and achieve the goals of unity, education, and transformation. At the same time, we also realize that the political attitude and ideological style of intellectuals should not be confused. Even when criticizing a person's stance and ideology, if they have made achievements and contributions in academic work, they should also be affirmed. In our experience, this is in line with the Party's policy. Because last year the Party committees and leaders of medical colleges across the country followed the mass line, boldly mobilized the masses, believed in the majority of the masses, and implemented great blooming and contending, big-character posters, and great debates, solved the problems of political thought and academic professional work, and promoted the transformation and unity of intellectuals, the enthusiasm of teachers, students, and staff was greatly improved. Teaching methods, medical style, service spirit, mass viewpoint, and labor attitude have all made significant progress. These are the driving forces for the great leap forward in our medical education事业 last year.

II. Last year's great leap forward in medical education事业 was also the result of implementing the policy of "education serving proletarian politics" and "education combined with productive labor."

Last year, medical colleges across the country implemented the Party's correct policy, implemented the principle of combining popularization and improvement, and medical education across the country has developed unprecedentedly, from the original thirty-eight institutions of higher medical education to more than one hundred. Students' moral, physical, and intellectual education have all increased, and the quality of teaching has been significantly improved. Teachers have begun to overcome the tendency to be divorced from politics, reality, and production. These progresses can also be seen from the situation of our college last year. Our college actively carried out work-study programs last year. Under the leadership of the college Party committee, it established factories (textbook factory, instrument factory, pharmaceutical factory) and a farm combining the three aspects of teaching, research, and production. Teachers, students, and staff of the whole college actively participated in labor such as building reservoirs, rushing to plant and harvest, accumulating fertilizer, planting trees, building railways, and nationwide steelmaking. This strengthened the labor viewpoint and mass viewpoint of teachers, students, and staff. The students showed great drive and enthusiasm in labor, were not afraid of hardship, and established deep feelings with the peasants. Every time they returned to school after finishing their work, the peasants were reluctant to part with them. Many overseas Chinese students have significantly improved their political awareness, labor, and learning enthusiasm through labor training. Obeying the Party's leadership and listening to the Party has become the mainstream of students' political thought. Under the principle of both actively participating in labor and minimizing the impact on the teaching plan, the college as a whole appropriately arranged the ratio of study, labor, and rest. Last year, the college not only listed labor as a formal course, but also carried out teaching work and completed the teaching plan according to the teaching plan. From practice, we believe that in institutions of higher medical education, the ratio of rest, labor, and teaching at 1:2:9 and 1:3:8 is more appropriate, and the mode of labor should not only include industrial and agricultural labor to go to the countryside and factories for labor training to cultivate the feelings of workers and peasants, but also labor that closely connects theory and practice and combines the major, and should be combined with the major as much as possible.

Combining medical education with mass patriotic health campaigns is an important measure to implement education serving proletarian politics. Last year, medical and pharmaceutical colleges across the country implemented this principle under the leadership of Party committees at all levels and achieved great results. At the end of last year, our college, in accordance with the instructions of the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee, sent a total of 1,256 teachers, doctors, and students to form many work teams to Zhanjiang, Jiangmen, Panyu, Haifeng, Hainan and other places to prevent and control epidemics, carry out patriotic health campaigns, train grassroots health workers, collect folk customs, visit virtuous people, carry out labor training, and on-site teaching. After more than two months of enthusiastic labor, under the leadership of the local Party committee, they mobilized the masses, carried out health propaganda, and cooperated with local traditional Chinese and Western medicine and health personnel to train health workers, nursery workers, and cooks (a total of more than 110,000 people), treat diseases, rescue critically ill patients, collect folk customs and visit virtuous people, and have done a lot in accumulating fertilizer, filling low-lying areas, and building toilets, and have won the praise of local Party and government leaders and the masses. In these tasks, they not only completed the tasks assigned by the Provincial Party Committee, which helped to rectify and consolidate the people's communes, but also cultivated the feelings of workers and peasants and the mass viewpoint of teachers and students. They all realized the urgent need of the vast rural areas for medicine and health and medical forces. They all expressed that they must study hard and go to work in the countryside after graduation. Through this practice, the students more firmly grasped the book knowledge they learned in school, exercised their practical work ability, and initially gained experience in carrying out grassroots mass health campaigns. This practical work has inspired the students to recognize the importance of learning theory. They understand that it is wrong for theory to be divorced from practice, but it is also wrong to emphasize practice while ignoring the study of theoretical courses. Therefore, they work harder to study after returning to school. We realize that combining medical education with mass patriotic health campaigns is one of the important methods to cultivate students to be both red and expert and healthy, and it is a necessary measure to implement the Party's education policy.

III. Medical education must be combined with the study of the legacy of traditional Chinese medicine.

Traditional Chinese medicine has accumulated thousands of years of experience in fighting diseases in our country and has rich scientific content. Actively exploring and carefully summarizing the rich experience and theories of traditional Chinese medicine is an extremely important measure to enrich and improve the level of medical science in our country. Last year, medical colleges across the country actively implemented the Party's policy on traditional Chinese medicine under the leadership of Party committees at all levels and achieved great results. In our college, since the second half of last year, from professors to medical staff, more than 90% of the people have participated in the study of traditional Chinese medicine theory according to the principles of voluntariness and possibility, and have carried out mass acupuncture movement, established various traditional Chinese medicine research groups, and compiled more than 100 theses. In the two affiliated hospitals, traditional Chinese medicine has been used to treat more than 200 kinds of diseases, many of which have significant curative effects. At the beginning of this year, when going to the countryside to carry out the movement to eliminate pests and diseases, we vigorously carried out the movement to collect folk customs and visit virtuous people, and collected more than 870,000 prescriptions. We followed the instructions of the Ministry of Health and transferred seventeen teachers to study traditional Chinese medicine full-time. On the other hand, we organized in-service teachers to participate in amateur traditional Chinese medicine night university studies, and incorporated the effective traditional Chinese medicine therapies that we had sorted out into the teaching materials. We emphasized that Western medicine should learn from traditional Chinese medicine, and included traditional Chinese medicine courses in the teaching plan, accounting for a certain proportion. At the same time, we emphasized that we should learn traditional Chinese medicine on the basis of learning Western medicine well. Learning traditional Chinese medicine is to enable students to initially master the basic theories and general diagnosis and treatment techniques of traditional Chinese medicine. Medical staff should study traditional Chinese medicine in conjunction with their specialties under the principles of voluntariness and possibility. The experience of the past year tells us that in order to further implement the Party's education policy, combining medical education with the study of the legacy of traditional Chinese medicine is also one of the necessary measures.

IV. Doing a good job in teacher-student relations is the key to doing a good job in teaching.

We must advocate the new teacher-student relationship—the principle of "respecting teachers and loving students, teaching and learning from each other." Last year, in the teaching revolution and the movement to criticize academic thought, the teacher-student relationship underwent profound changes. In order to implement the Party's education policy, the old teaching system, teaching viewpoints, teaching methods, and teaching ideas should be criticized. Therefore, it is necessary for students to raise opinions to teachers, and the effects and achievements are also very great. We should affirm this point. However, after the education revolution, in some schools, the teacher-student relationship was a bit tense, and individual young teachers and students had a tendency to negate everything, be arrogant and complacent, but this phenomenon was quickly corrected. At present, the teacher-student relationship in our college is generally good. Old teachers can love students and impart their knowledge and experience to young teachers and students without reservation. Students can also respect teachers, and at the same time, they can appropriately raise opinions to teachers. In our teaching work, we must, under the leadership of the school Party committee, give full play to the leading role of old teachers in teaching, that is, teachers should teach students, test students, revise students' homework, answer students' questions, etc. Students should respect teachers; young teachers should humbly learn from old teachers. At the same time, according to the principle of teaching and learning from each other, we encourage and support students to raise opinions to teachers with leadership; young teachers and old teachers should carry out academic debates. Teachers and students, young teachers and old teachers, should establish democratic and equal relations. In this way, we can improve the teacher-student relationship, do a good job in teaching, and more comprehensively implement the Party's education policy.

V. The most important key to doing a good job in teaching and comprehensively implementing the Party's education policy is to continue to strengthen and consolidate the Party's leadership in the school and strengthen political and ideological work.

As everyone knows, without correct thinking, it is impossible to correctly understand the Party's policies; without correct thinking, it is impossible to have a correct work style and work methods. The reason why the education work has achieved great success in the past year is because the Party's leadership has been strengthened and political and ideological work has been strengthened. But from the perspective of our school, we have not done enough in this regard; we must do a better, more in-depth, and more meticulous job in this regard in the future. We plan to strengthen political and ideological work, on the one hand, to combine political education with political movements, connect with reality, to transform students' thinking and cultivate students' communist morality, and on the other hand, to increase the teaching hours of political theory courses, so that students can learn the basic theoretical knowledge of Marxism-Leninism and Chairman Mao Zedong's works more and more systematically, in order to improve students' political theoretical level. At the same time, we must continue to further implement the policy of combining education with productive labor, and strengthen and consolidate students' labor viewpoint on the basis of the achievements in participating in labor last year. In terms of faculty and staff, in the future, we will follow the unified regulations of the central government and each person will spend one month each year participating in general industrial and agricultural labor and labor combined with their major, in order to further strengthen and consolidate the labor viewpoint and mass viewpoint, and strengthen the connection between theory and practice. This is urgently needed for implementing the Party's education policy and doing a good job in teaching.

Finally, we would like to talk about our impressions of the inspection in Guangdong this time. From March 27th, we inspected five areas in Dongjiang, Guangdong: Huiyang, Haifeng, Shanwei, Shantou, and Chao'an, for a period of nine days. Due to time constraints, we only focused on the construction of people's communes and cultural, educational, and health care as the center of our inspection. During our inspection, we deeply realized the superiority of the people's commune system and the correctness of the central government's policies. The central government's decisions and instructions on rectifying and consolidating the people's communes have been conveyed to all the communes we visited, so the peasant masses have realized the nature of the people's communes as collectively owned at the present stage, and they have realized that the people's communes must implement distribution according to labor, equivalent exchange, and must implement unified leadership, hierarchical management, and hierarchical accounting. In Shanwei, we saw that the enthusiasm of fishermen for production has greatly increased, so production has greatly developed. For example, the number of fish caught in March reached more than 22,300 dan, which is 270% of the total output in January and February. Some fishermen even braved strong winds to go to sea. The fishing boat of commune member Zhong Caishan had great enthusiasm for production, saved water and food, stayed at sea for one more day, and caught more than 40 dan of fish. After returning to port, he went to sea again that night and caught more than 30 dan. The further improvement of the enthusiasm of fishermen and peasants shows that the central government's policy of rectifying and consolidating the communes is very correct.

We have visited many commune's public canteens, homes for the elderly, kindergartens and nurseries. Everywhere we met old and young men and women and masses working in the fields, they showed a cheerful and healthy appearance. All this shows that the lives of peasants have undergone a fundamental change. What impressed us the most was the new fishing village in Shanwei, where we saw that the children of fishermen grew up very lively and healthy, and the folk songs sung by the amateur choir composed of fishermen's women were very moving. We also saw that the public canteen of the fishermen's commune was very well run and the nutrition was very rich. Each person could eat six to eight taels of fresh fish and meat every day. All this shows the great superiority of the people's commune system.

However, during our inspection, we also learned that in the past, the communes had too much coverage, which caused some problems. With the development of the commune rectification work, these problems have been solved. In short, we feel that the establishment of the people's communes is a fundamental reform that concerns the material and cultural life of 500 million peasants, promotes the development of agricultural production and the entire rural economy and culture, and fully demonstrates its superiority. At the same time, thanks to the central government's correct and timely formulation of the guidelines and policies for the rectification and construction of the people's communes, and the joint efforts of the entire Party and the people of the whole country, the superiority of the communes will be more significant, and the cause of socialist construction will leap forward even greater, better, and more comprehensively.

    贯彻党的教育方针的几点体会
    柯麟  梁伯强　谢志光代表谈中山医学院去年取得的成绩
    我们完全同意和拥护周恩来总理所作的政府工作报告、李富春副总理关于一九五九年度国民经济计划（草案）的报告、李先念副总理关于一九五八年国家决算和一九五九年国家预算（草案）的报告、彭真副委员长关于全国人民代表大会常务委员会工作报告，并在今后的实际工作中坚决贯彻执行。
    去年是我国大跃进的一年，是各种社会主义建设事业取得光辉成就的一年。在科学文化战线上，医学教育和其他事业一样，在党的正确领导和社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，循着“全国一盘棋”和“两条腿走路”的方针，也跃进了一大步，而且正以更矫健的步伐不断地跃进着。
    我们可以肯定：由于国民经济飞跃的发展，人民对物质生活和文化生活的要求的不断提高，任何事业都要不断跃进，一年胜过一年，才能满足人民的愿望。
    我们是从事医学教育工作的，我们当前的任务就是千方百计努力把今年的医学教育工作办得更好，争取更大的跃进，使之符合人民的愿望。
    根据我们多年来在工作岗位上的经验，特别是去年教育革命的初步经验，我们有下面几点不成熟的体会：
    一、去年全国医学教育事业的跃进和发展：是在反右、整风取得了伟大胜利、加强了党的领导，政治挂帅、走群众路线、坚决贯彻“教育为无产阶级政治服务”“教育与生产劳动相结合”的方针的情况下取得的。
    医学院校和其他高等学校一样，是知识分子成群的所在，确立和巩固党的领导，贯彻党对知识分子的团结、改造、教育的政策，使其为工人阶级服务，为社会主义事业服务，在什么时候都是最主要的努力方向。拿我们中山医学院来讲，经过反右整风、大鸣大放、红专辩论、教学改革等一系列运动之后，搞臭了资产阶级个人主义，批判了资产阶级学术思想，解决了政治与业务关系的问题，师生员工在政治思想上有了深刻的变化和一定程度的进步，其中一部分人改变了阶级立场，成为工人阶级的知识分子，一部分中间状态的人，在不同程度上向左转化；现在，在政治上、业务上，师生员工一般都能接受党的领导，积极努力工作，在教学工作、科学研究工作、医疗工作等方面，都能在党的领导下，依照计划进行。如在我院附属医院的医疗工作中，当党号召全力抢救炼钢烧伤的工人时，医护人员就喊出“要血有血”“要皮有皮”的感人的口号，个个不辞劳苦、夜以继日地全心全意地为伤者治疗；教授专家也放下架子，为伤病者奉汤送药，待病人如亲人。为了普及医学教育，大量培养高级卫生人才，支援各专区开办医学院分院，我们学院的教授、讲师、助教、技术员等都无条件接受任务。中山医学院去年开办了三个分院、三个医专。去冬又为了配合人民公社的整顿、巩固工作，我院根据省委的指示，曾迅速地派遣了教师、医生、护士、高年级学生共一千二百多人，到江门、湛江专区各县市及水库工地，进行防疫、爱国卫生运动和训练培养基层卫生干部，都取得了很大成绩。上述情况，不但在我院如此，在全国各地医学院校也是如此，这一切证明：有了党的正确领导，政治挂帅，知识分子的政治思想觉悟提高了，教学、医疗、防疫等种种工作就能顺利进行，大大跃进。
    因此，我们深深地体会到对知识分子的团结、改造是非常重要的。当进行这工作时，必须作具体分析，分别对待，做到深入细致。要推动知识分子的自我改造，就必须先了解他们，理解他们的政治思想情况、业务情况。区别那些是属于政治问题的范畴，那些是属于思想问题的范畴，那些是属于学术思想的范畴，那些是属于生活作风的范畴，情况弄清楚了，才能有的放矢，才能达到团结、教育、改造的目的。同时，我们也体会到知识分子的政治态度与思想作风不应该混淆起来。就是在批判一个人的立场思想的时候，如果在学术上有成就和有一些贡献的，也应该给予肯定。照我们的体会，这样才符合党的方针。由于去年全国各医学院校的党委和领导走群众路线，放手发动群众，相信群众的多数，实行大鸣大放、大字报、大辩论，解决了政治思想与学术业务的问题，推动了知识分子的改造和团结，因而师生员工的积极性就大大提高；教学方法，医疗作风，服务精神，群众观点，劳动态度，都有了显著的进步，这些就是我们去年医学教育事业大跃进的动力。
    二、去年医学教育事业的大跃进，也是贯彻了“教育为无产阶级政治服务”和“教育与生产劳动相结合”的方针的结果。
    去年全国各医学院校贯彻了党的这个正确方针，执行了普及与提高相结合的原则，全国医学教育有了空前的发展，由原来的三十八所高等医学院校发展到一百多所；学生的德育，体育和智育都有所增长，教学质量有了显著的提高，教师开始克服脱离政治、脱离实际和脱离生产的倾向。这些进步从我们学院去年的情况，也可以看出来。我们的学院去年积极地开展了勤工俭学的活动，在学院党委领导下，开办了三个结合专业的工厂（教材厂、仪器厂、制药厂）和一个农场；全院师生员工积极参加了修筑水库，抢种抢收，积肥植树，筑铁路和全民炼钢等劳动。这都加强了师生员工的劳动观点和群众观点。学生们在劳动中表现得干劲大，热情高，不怕艰苦，并且与农民建立了深厚的感情，每次工作结束返校时，农民都依依不舍。许多华侨学生，通过劳动锻炼，政治觉悟、劳动和学习的积极性都有了显著的提高。服从党的领导，听党的话，已经成为学生政治思想上的主流。学院全体师生在既要积极劳动，又要尽量不影响教学计划的原则下，适当安排了学习、劳动和休息的比例。学院去年不但已经将劳动列为正式课程，而且按照教学计划，进行了教学工作，完成了教学计划。我们从实践中，认为在高等医学院校的休息、劳动、教学的比例以在一、二、九和一、三、八之间较为合适，而且劳动的方式应该既有下乡下厂进行劳动锻炼，培养工农感情的工农业劳动，又要有使理论与实际密切联系、结合专业的劳动，而且应该尽可能的结合专业。
    医学教育与群众性的爱国卫生运动相结合，是贯彻教育为无产阶级政治服务的重要措施。去年全国医药院校在各级党委领导下都执行了这一原则，取得了很大的成绩。我院去年底遵照广东省委的指示，为了配合人民公社的整顿巩固工作，派遣了教师、医生、学生计一千二百五十六人，组成许多工作队到湛江、江门两个专区和番禺、海丰、海南等地进行防治流行病，开展爱国卫生运动、训练基层卫生工作干部、采风访贤、劳动锻炼、现场教学等工作。他们经过两个多月的热情劳动，在当地党委领导下，发动群众，进行卫生宣传，并与地方中西医药卫生人员共同合作下，在训练保健员、保育员和炊事员（共十一万多名），治疗疾病、抢救危急病人、采风访贤以及在积肥、填洼地、修建厕所等方面，都做出了不少的成绩，并获得了当地党政领导和群众的好评。在这些工作中，不仅完成了省委所交给的任务，有助于人民公社的整顿和巩固，而且培养了师生的工农感情和群众观点，他们都了解到广大农村对于医药卫生和医疗力量的迫切需要，他们都表示一定要好好学习，毕业后到农村去工作。通过这种实践，学生们更牢固地掌握了在学校中学得的书本知识，锻炼了实际工作的能力，初步取得了搞基层群众卫生运动工作的经验。这些实际工作，又启发了同学们认识到学习理论的重要性，他们懂得理论脱离实际是不对的，但是只强调实际而忽视了理论课程的学习也是不对的，因此，他们回校后更加努力学习。我们体会医学教育与群众性爱国卫生运动相结合，是培养学生又红又专又健的重要方法之一，是贯彻党的教育方针的必要措施。
    三、医学教育必须与学习祖国医学遗产相结合。
    祖国医学积累了我国数千年对疾病斗争的经验，有丰富的科学内容，积极发掘和认真总结中医中药的丰富经验和理论，是充实和提高我国医学科学水平的一个极为重要的措施。去年全国各医学院校在各级党委的领导下，都积极贯彻了党的中医政策，取得了很大的成绩。在我们学院，从去年下半年以来由教授到医护人员，根据自愿与可能的原则，百分之九十以上的人都参加了中医理论学习，开展了群众性的学习针灸运动，成立了各种中医中药研究小组，编写了一百多篇论著；在两个附属医院中，使用中医中药治疗的已有二百多种病，其中有许多有显著的疗效。今年年初下乡搞除害灭病运动时，又大力开展了采风访贤运动，共采方八十七万多条。我们一面遵照卫生部的指示，调派了十七位教师脱产学习中医；另方面又组织在职教师参加业余中医夜大学学习，并将整理出来的行之有效的中医中药疗法吸收到教材中去。我们一面强调西医学习中医，将中医课列入教学计划之内，并占一定的比重，但同时又强调要在学好西医的基础上学习中医，学习中医是使学生能够初步掌握祖国医学的基础理论和一般诊疗技术。医护人员学习中医，要在自愿和可能的原则下，结合专业进行。一年来的经验告诉我们，为了进一步贯彻党的教育方针，医学教育与学习祖国医学遗产相结合，也是必要措施之一。
    四、搞好师生关系是搞好教学工作的关键。
    我们要提倡新的师生关系——“尊师爱生，教学相长”的原则。去年在教学革命和学术思想批判运动中，师生关系起了深刻的变化。为了贯彻党的教育方针，对旧的教学制度、教学观点、教学方法、教学思想应进行批判，因此学生对老师提意见是必要的，而且效果和成绩也是很大，这一点我们应该肯定。但是在教育革命运动后，在有些学校中，师生关系有点紧张，个别青年教师和学生有否定一切、骄傲自满的倾向，但这种现象很快就纠正过来了。目前我们学院的师生关系一般是良好的，老教师能爱护学生，无保留地将自己的知识和经验传授给青年教师和学生，学生也能尊敬老师，同时又能向老师适当地提意见。我们在教学工作中，要做到在学校党委领导下，充分发挥老教师在教学上的主导作用，即是老师要教学生、考学生、修改学生的作业、解答学生的疑问等。学生则要尊敬老师；青年教师要虚心向老教师学习。同时我们根据教学相长的原则，鼓励和支持学生，有领导地向教师提意见；青年教师和老教师在学术上要开展争鸣。师生之间，青年教师和老教师之间，要建立民主的平等的关系。这样就能搞好师生关系，搞好教学工作，就能更全面地贯彻党的教育方针。
    五、搞好教学工作，全面贯彻党的教育方针最主要的关键，是继续加强和巩固党在学校的领导，加强政治思想工作。
    大家知道，没有正确的思想，就不可能正确地体会党的方针政策；没有正确的思想，就不可能有正确的工作作风和工作方法。一年来教育工作之所以取得伟大的成绩，就是由于加强了党的领导，加强了政治思想工作。但是从我们的学校来说，在这方面还做得不够；今后还要更好、更深入、更细致地做好这方面的工作。我们计划加强政治思想工作，一方面使政治教育既结合政治运动，联系实际，用以改造学生的思想，培养学生的共产主义道德品质，另方面又增加政治理论课的教学时数，使更多和更系统地学习马列主义的基本理论知识和毛泽东主席的著作，用以提高学生的政治理论水平。同时还要继续进一步贯彻教育与生产劳动相结合的方针，在去年参加劳动获得成绩的基础上加强和巩固学生的劳动观点。在教职员方面今后要按照中央的统一规定，每人每年用一个月的时间参加一般的工农业劳动和结合专业的劳动，以进一步加强和巩固劳动观点和群众观点，加强理论与实际的联系，这对于贯彻党的教育方针和搞好教学工作，是迫切需要的。
                ××××
    最后我们想顺便谈一谈这次在广东视察的观感。我们从三月二十七日起，在广东东江的惠阳、海丰、汕尾、汕头、潮安等五个地区作了为时九天的视察。由于时间关系，我们只以人民公社的建设和文教卫生作为视察的中心。我们在视察中深刻地体会到人民公社制度的优越性和中央政策的正确性。我们所到各社均已传达了中央关于整顿和巩固人民公社的决定和指示，因此农民群众都认识了人民公社在现阶段集体所有制的性质，认识了人民公社必须实行按劳分配，等价交换，必须实行统一领导、分级管理、分级核算等等。我们在汕尾看到渔民生产积极性大大的提高，因此生产有了很大的发展，例如三月份捕鱼的数量达二万二千三百多担，为一、二两个月总产量的百分之二百七十。有的渔民还冒着强风出海，社员钟才善的渔船生产劲头大，节水节食，多留在海上一天，就多打四十多担鱼，返航后当晚又出海，再打了三十多担。渔民和农民的积极性这样进一步的提高，说明了中央关于公社的整顿和巩固，其方针政策是非常正确的。
    我们曾参观许多公社的公共食堂、敬老院、幼儿园和托儿所。在这些地方遇见的男女老少和在田间劳动的群众，都表现出心情愉快和健康活泼。这一切说明了农民的生活已经起了根本的改变。最令我们印象深刻的是在汕尾的渔民新村，见渔民的儿童长得非常活泼和健康，由渔民妇女组成的业余歌咏队所唱的民歌非常令人感动。我们又看到渔民公社的公共食堂办得很好，营养很丰富，每人每天可吃到新鲜鱼肉六至八两。这一切都显示着人民公社制度的巨大优越性。
    但在我们的视察中，也获悉了过去公社曾因包得太多而出现一些问题。随着公社整顿工作的开展，这些问题已经解决了。总之，我们感到人民公社的建立，是关系到五亿农民物质生活和文化生活的根本改革，促进了农业生产和整个农村经济、文化的发展，充分显示它的优越性。同时更由于中央正确地、及时地提出了人民公社的整顿和建设工作的方针政策，和全党和全国人民的共同努力，公社的优越性就会更加显著，社会主义的建设事业就会更大、更好和更全面地跃进。
