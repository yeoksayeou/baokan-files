Xinhua News Agency, 7th. Premier Münnich Ferenc, Member of the Political Bureau, Central Committee of the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, of the Hungarian Worker-Peasant Revolutionary Government, said in his farewell speech at the Beijing Airport:
	Dear Comrade Zhou Enlai, Dear Comrades, Dear Friends!
	Our unforgettable and eventful visit has come to an end, and the moment of parting has arrived.
	Now, as we say goodbye, each of us is convinced that our visit has contributed to further deepening the friendship between the people of our two countries and has further strengthened our great socialist camp. We express our heartfelt gratitude for the boundless love and fraternal friendship we have felt every moment of our days here. I can assure you that we leave your country with immense pride, because we communists know that the achievements of millions of Chinese working people under the leadership of the Communist Party of China are, for the people of the world, an indisputable proof of the unparalleled superiority of our socialist society and the inevitable victory of socialism. Every ordinary day of the great Chinese people is filled with a series of inspiring and great actions. The bold steps and the spirit of courageous and novel creation have deservedly won universal praise throughout the world. We hope that you can feel through our words how much our people admire the creative labor of the Chinese working people.
	It is difficult for us to express in a few words what has impressed us the most in China. If we can choose from many attractive experiences, then I want to emphasize the creative power manifested in everything, a power formed by the combination of high spirits and clear goals, with humility and the consciousness of observing discipline. We have seen this power many times in these days. We will talk about this at home as one of the most beautiful experiences, because it is the children of China who won freedom through armed struggle and have made up for nearly hundreds of years of backwardness in a few years with unparalleled great labor, are humble, disciplined, and enthusiastic.
	The love, respect, and loyalty of the Chinese people to the Communist Party of China, which has been tempered in glorious struggles, is an example we can follow. The Communist Party of China has consistently been faithful to the theory of Marxism-Leninism in the revolutionary struggle and construction, and has developed it and demonstrated its application. This is how the Communist Party of China has led and is leading the Chinese people in their struggle. Dear comrades, dear friends,
	Please allow me to once again express my gratitude for your warm reception and meticulous care. You can believe that we will report to our country the experiences of our trip and report that we have completed the task given to us by our people to further closer our fraternal relations.
	I wish you new achievements in developing the economy and culture and in socialist construction, and continue to write the history of New China in the same brilliant characters as in the past. I wish you to continue your construction work in a peaceful environment, because the sunshine of peace should forever shine on our common path. I wish all the Chinese people good health, happiness, and more achievements in their great work.
	Long live the eternal friendship between the Chinese and Hungarian people!
	Long live the rock-solid unity of the socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union!
	Long live the great People's Republic of China!
	Long live peace!

　　明尼赫总理的讲话
    新华社7日讯　匈牙利社会主义工人党中央委员会政治局委员、匈牙利工农革命政府总理明尼赫·费伦茨在北京机场的告别讲话亲爱的周恩来同志，亲爱的同志们，亲爱的朋友们！
    我们难忘的富有经历的访问已经结束了，分别的时刻已经来到了。
    现在，当我们告别的时候，我们每一个人都确信，我们的访问已经对进一步加深我们两国人民之间的友谊作出了贡献，并且进一步加强了我们伟大的社会主义阵营。我们以十分感动的心情，对我们在这里渡过的日子的每一个时刻所感受到的无限热爱和兄弟友情表示感谢。我可以向你们保证，我们带着崇高的自豪感离开你们的国土，因为我们共产党人都知道，千百万中国劳动人民在中国共产党的领导下所获得的成就，对全世界人民来说，是我们社会主义社会无比优越性和社会主义必然胜利的无可争辩的证明。伟大的中国人民的每一个平凡的日子里，都有着一系列令人鼓舞的、伟大的行动。大胆的步伐和勇敢而新颖的创举精神，无愧地赢得了全世界的普遍赞扬。我们希望，你们能够通过我们的言语体会到，我国人民对中国劳动人民的创造性的劳动是多么钦佩。
    我们很难用几句话来表达，在中国，是什么东西给了我们最大的影响。如果可以在许多吸引人的经历中挑选的话，那么我要强调指出的，是表现在一切方面的富有创造性的力量，这种力量是由于充满干劲和明确目标、同谦逊精神和遵守纪律的自觉性相结合而形成的。这种力量我们在这几天内已经多次地看到过。我们将在国内把这一点作为最美好的经验之一来谈到，因为就是这用武装斗争赢得自由的、并且用无可比拟的巨大劳动在几年内弥补了几乎是几百年的落后的中国的儿女是谦逊的、遵守纪律的和热情的。
    中国人民对在光荣斗争中经过锻炼的中国共产党的那种热爱、尊敬和忠诚，是我们可以追随的榜样。中国共产党在革命斗争中和建设事业中始终如一地忠实于马克思列宁主义的理论，并且发展了它和示范地运用了它，中国共产党就是这样领导过和领导着中国人民进行斗争的。亲爱的同志们，亲爱的朋友们，
    请允许我再一次对你们的热情接待和无微不至的关怀表示感谢。你们可以相信，我们将向国内报告我们这次旅途的经历，并且报告我们已经完成了我国人民所给予我们的、促使我们之间的兄弟关系更加密切的这一任务。
    祝你们在发展经济和文化方面和在社会主义建设方面获得新的成就，并且像过去一样，以同样光辉的大字继续书写新中国的历史。祝你们在和平环境中继续进行建设工作，因为和平的阳光应该永远地照耀着我们共同的道路。祝中国全体人民在伟大的工作中身体健康、幸福，并且取得更多成就。
    中匈两国人民的永恒的友谊万岁！
    以苏联为首的社会主义阵营坚如磐石的团结万岁！
    伟大的中华人民共和国万岁！
    和平万岁！
