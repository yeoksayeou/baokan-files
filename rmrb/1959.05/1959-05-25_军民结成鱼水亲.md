The People's Liberation Army land and naval forces stationed in the Zhoushan Islands have made remarkable achievements in supporting the socialist construction of the Zhoushan Islands and have established a close relationship with the people of Zhoushan like fish and water. The Zhoushan Islands are one of China's largest fishing grounds, and it has been a full nine years since their liberation on May 17th of this year. The Chinese People's Liberation Army land and naval forces stationed in the Zhoushan area are determined to work with the local people to build Zhoushan into a strong fortress and a happy people's paradise on the sea.

In the early days of entering the islands, the vast number of commanders and fighters conscientiously implemented the Party's instructions, actively helped the masses restore production, rebuild their homes destroyed by the Kuomintang army, sent a large number of personnel to assist local governments in carrying out mass work, and, with the assistance of the people, annihilated the remaining bandits at sea. In recent years, while undertaking the important task of defending the coast, the troops have vigorously supported the socialist construction of the Zhoushan area. The soldiers said: "The islands are our home, the people are our parents, the army and the people are of one heart, and we are not afraid of any difficulties!"

Over the years, whenever it is the busy farming season or when there are wind and drought disasters, the officers and soldiers have done their best to support the island residents in overcoming the disasters. During the Great Leap Forward in 1958, the troops contributed more than 784,000 labor days, helping the masses build 280 large and small reservoirs and accumulate more than 614,000 dan of fertilizer. In May of last year, 100,000 sweet potato seedlings were shipped to the island and had to be planted within 24 hours, otherwise they would rot. At the same time, there were 500 bags of rice that urgently needed to be unloaded. At this time, most of the men on the island had gone to sea to fish, leaving only women. After hearing this news, the troops stationed on the island immediately helped the masses complete all the tasks within 24 hours. In August of last year, Zhoushan suffered a severe drought, and the troops stationed on the island, from generals to soldiers, participated in the fight against drought to protect seedlings, helping the local people overcome the drought. The people praised the island troops for their "five rescues" (rescuing lives, wind and fire disasters, fishing boats, crops, and houses).

After the upsurge of the cultural revolution was launched throughout the country, the troops continuously established people's schools, taught literacy in every village, and sent 379 teachers to help the island people set up 132 people's schools, and also donated many books and cultural supplies to the people's schools. Shi Qintang, a soldier of a certain unit stationed on Changtu Island, has persisted in running a people's school in Dakeng Village since August 1956, enabling the young and middle-aged people in this village to get rid of illiteracy. The people enthusiastically call him "Teacher Shi."

Before liberation, fishermen here could only resign themselves to fate when they got sick. Now, the hospitals run by the troops stationed on the island take the initiative to prevent and treat diseases for the masses. In the past year, they have treated more than 67,000 people, and have also helped the people's communes train more than 1,290 health workers, reducing the diseases of the local people and improving the sanitary conditions on some small islands. Wang Bin, a health worker of a certain unit stationed on Daishan Island, used acupuncture to cure many patients among the residents, and some deaf and mute people were also cured. The masses call him "Little Miracle Doctor."

In the past nine years, the navy has fought dozens of large and small battles to escort fishing boats and protect them from the enemy, rescuing more than 1,300 fishing boats in distress, and also rescuing many fishermen. In August 1956, a level 12 typhoon suddenly struck the Zhoushan Islands. All the troops stationed on the island were dispatched, rescuing people for two days and nights, and donating clothes and materials to help the local people. Some warships that became famous for rescuing fishing boats and fishermen were called "life-saving ships" and "sea saviors" by the fishermen. The fishermen said: Before liberation, it was "pirates in front, storms behind. When the boat reaches Nanjiu Mountain, wives and children are separated." Now it is "With the Party's guidance, we are not afraid of high winds and waves; with the navy's protection, we are not afraid of pirates."

The People's Liberation Army troops stationed in the Zhoushan Islands have vigorously supported the construction of the islands and have been enthusiastically praised by the Party and government organs and the people in the Zhoushan area. The people on the island wrote a poem for this, saying: "Mountains are connected to mountains, hearts are connected to hearts, the People's Liberation Army are our own people, we work together to build the islands, the army and the people are united like fish and water."

    军民结成鱼水亲
    新华社记者　张涛
    驻在舟山群岛的人民解放军陆海军部队，对支援舟山群岛的社会主义建设作出了显著的成绩，和舟山人民群众建立了鱼水般的密切关系。舟山群岛是我国最大的渔场之一，到今年5月17日，解放整整九年了。驻在舟山地区的中国人民解放军陆、海军部队，决心和当地人民一起把舟山建成一座坚强的堡垒和海上人民乐园。
    部队在进入海岛初期，广大指战员就认真执行了党的指示，积极帮助群众恢复生产，重建被国民党军队破坏了的家园，派出了大批人员协助地方政府开展群众工作，并且在人民群众的协助下，歼灭了海上的残匪。近几年来，部队一方面担负着保卫海防的重大任务，一方面大力支援了舟山地区的社会主义建设。战士们说：“海岛就是家，人民是爹妈，军民结成一条心，什么困难都不怕！”
    历年来，每逢农忙季节或是遇到风旱灾时，部队官兵就全力支援岛上居民战胜灾害。在大跃进的1958年，部队做了七十八万四千多个劳动日，帮助群众修筑了大、小水库二百八十个，积肥六十一万四千多担。去年5月间，岛上运来了十万棵地瓜秧，要在一昼夜内插完，不然就会烂掉。同时又有五百包大米，急待卸运。这时，岛上的男人大都下海捕鱼去了，只剩下妇女。驻岛部队听到这个消息以后，就立即帮助群众在一昼夜间完成了全部任务。去年8月舟山旱情严重，驻岛部队从将军到士兵都投入了抗旱保苗的斗争中，帮助当地人民战胜了旱灾。人民群众赞扬海岛的部队有“五抢之功”（抢救人命、风灾火险、渔船、农作物、房屋）。
    在全国掀起了文化革命的高潮以后，部队连连办民校，村村教识字，派出了三百七十九名教员，帮助海岛人民办起了一百三十二所民校，还给民校捐赠了许多图书和文化用具。驻长涂岛某部战士史钦堂，从1956年8月在大岙村办民校后，一直坚持到现在，使这个村的青壮年都摘掉了文盲帽子。人民群众热情地称他“史老师”。
    解放以前，这里的渔民得了病只能听天由命。现在，驻岛部队办的医院，主动地为群众防治疾病。去年一年中，为群众治病六万七千多人次，还帮助人民公社培养了一千二百九十多名卫生人员，减少了当地人民的疾病，改善了一些小岛上的卫生条件。驻岱山岛某部卫生员王斌用针灸治好了许多居民中的病人，有些聋子、哑吧也被治好了，群众都叫他“小神医”。
    九年来，海军部队为护航护渔和敌人进行了大小战斗几十次，抢救遇险渔船一千三百多只，并且救出了不少渔民。1956年8月间，突然有十二级台风袭击舟山群岛，驻岛部队全部出动，抢救了两昼夜，并且捐献衣物，救济当地群众。由于抢救渔船、渔民而出名的一些舰艇，被渔民称为“救命船”、“海上救星”。渔民说：解放前是“前面是海盗，后面有风暴。船到南韭山，老婆孩子都拆散。”现在是“有了党引导，不怕风浪高；有了海军保，不怕海盗扰。”
    人民解放军驻舟山群岛的部队大力支援海岛建设，得到了舟山地区党政机关和人民群众的热情赞扬。岛上人民为此写了一首诗歌，他们说：“山连山来心连心，解放军是我们自己人，同心协力建海岛，军民结成鱼水亲。”
