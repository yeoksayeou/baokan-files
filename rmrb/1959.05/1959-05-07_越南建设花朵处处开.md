　　Vietnam Construction: Flowers Blooming Everywhere
　　
　　宜安 Built New Power Station
　　
　　宜安, the capital of Nghệ An Province in Vietnam, held a ceremony on May 4th to mark the completion of a power station with a generating capacity of 8,000 kilowatts. 宜安 will become the third industrial center in North Vietnam. The other two industrial centers are the light industrial center in Việt Trì, Phú Thọ Province, and the steel center in Thái Nguyên, the capital of the Việt Bắc Autonomous Region.
　　
　　This new power station was built on the site of an old power station that was destroyed during the war, but its generating capacity is three times that of the original power station.
　　
　　This power station is one of the six modern power stations scheduled to be built in North Vietnam under the Three-Year Plan ending in 1960. The equipment for the power station was provided by the Soviet Union, which also sent technicians to help build the project. The work at the power station is almost entirely mechanized. Since this power station began partial power generation in March last year, the 宜安 Power Station has supplied power to the provincial capital and the nearby Bến Thủy port, and has also supplied power to the pumping stations of a huge irrigation system in the southwest of the province, which irrigates more than 17,000 hectares of arable land. This power station will also supply electricity to rice mills, water supply stations, brick and tile factories, cement factories and other local industrial enterprises.
　　
　　State Farm Production Surges
　　
　　According to figures released at the National State Farm Conference currently being held in Hanoi, the total value of agricultural products from the sixteen state farms in North Vietnam last year increased by 26.6% compared to 1957.
　　
　　In 1958, 60% of the more than 3,500 hectares of cultivated land on state farms was used to grow coffee, oil crops and fruit trees, 30% to grow industrial crops, rice and secondary crops, and the remaining cultivated land to trial rubber and other tropical trees.
　　
　　These state farms currently have 93 tractors and more than 5,500 head of draught animals. More than 7,000 workers work there.
　　
　　Investment in the first quarter of 1959 was much greater than investment for the whole of last year. During the same period, farm workers also reclaimed 783 hectares of wasteland. The area to be cultivated by state farms this year is planned to be more than double the area cultivated in 1958.
　　
　　Catholics Join Agricultural Cooperatives
　　
　　According to a report in the Vietnamese "People's Daily" on the 5th, more than 10,000 Catholic households in Nam Định Province, which has the largest Catholic population in North Vietnam, have joined agricultural cooperatives and mutual aid teams. They account for 28% of the total number of Catholics in Nam Định Province.
　　
　　In the three Catholic villages of An Xá, Xuân Hà and Văn Lý in this province, all Catholics in the villages have joined agricultural cooperatives and mutual aid teams.
　　
　　The province has trained more than 400 Catholic cadres in the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement.

　　越南建设花朵处处开
    宜安建成新发电站
    越南义安省省会宜安4日举行了发电能力为八千瓩的发电站落成典礼。宜安将成为北越第三个工业中心。其他两个工业中心是富寿省越池的轻工业中心和越北自治区首府太原的钢铁中心。
    这个新的发电站建筑在抗战时被破坏的一个旧有的发电站的地址上，但是它的发电能力为原来的发电站的三倍。
    这个发电站是根据到1960年结束的三年计划准备在北越建造的六个现代化发电站中的一个。发电站的设备是苏联援助的，苏联还派技术人员来帮助建设这个工程。发电站的工作几乎全部机械化。从去年3月这个发电站开始局部发电以来，宜安发电站已供应省会和附近的边水港的用电，并且供给这个省西南部的一个巨大灌溉系统的抽水站用电，这个灌溉系统灌溉一万七千公顷以上的耕地。这个发电站还将供应电给一些碾米厂、给水站、砖瓦厂和水泥厂及其他地方工业企业。
    国营农场产量激增
    据目前在河内举行的国营农场会议上发表的数字，去年北越十六个国营农场的农产品总产值比1957年增加26.6％。
    1958年，国营农场的三千五百多公顷的耕地中有60％用来种植咖啡、油料作物和果树，30％种工业作物、大米和次要作物，其余的耕地用来试种橡胶和其它热带树木。
    这些国营农场目前有九十三部拖拉机和五千五百多头耕畜。共有七千多名工人在那里工作。
    1959年第一季度的投资比去年全年的投资大得多。在同一时期里，农场工人也开垦了七百八十三公顷荒地。国营农场计划在今年耕种的面积将比1958年的耕种面积大一倍多。
　　天主教徒参加农业社
    据越南“人民报”5日报道，北越天主教徒最多的南定省，已有一万多户天主教徒参加了农业合作社和变工组。他们占南定省天主教徒总数的28％。
    这个省的安沙、春河、文里等三个天主教乡，全乡教徒都加入了农业合作社和变工组。
    这个省在发展变工合作运动当中，已经培养出四百多名天主教徒干部。
