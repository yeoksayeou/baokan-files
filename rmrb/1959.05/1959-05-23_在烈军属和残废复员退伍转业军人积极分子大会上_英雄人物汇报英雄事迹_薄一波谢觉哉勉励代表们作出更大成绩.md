Xinhua News Agency, May 22nd -- At the National Congress of Active Elements of Revolutionary Martyrs' Families, Military Dependents, and Disabled, Demobilized, Retired, and Transferred Soldiers in Socialist Construction, representatives from all over the country reported on their achievements in the Great Leap Forward during the meetings on the 20th and 22nd. Their speeches were filled with boundless loyalty to the Party, demonstrating that they are all outstanding soldiers in the socialist revolution and socialist construction.

Vice Premier of the State Council Bo Yibo and President of the Supreme People's Court Xie Juezai spoke at the meeting on the 21st and 22nd respectively, warmly congratulating the representatives on their significant contributions to the cause of the Party and encouraging them to make even greater achievements in the continued Great Leap Forward.

More than a thousand representatives, with respect, warmly applauded the speeches of veteran Red Army soldiers Kuang Zhangda and Fang Heming at the meeting. Kuang Zhangda and Fang Heming had made great contributions to the revolution in the past. After retiring, they still regarded themselves as ordinary laborers, living frugally and maintaining close ties with the masses. The brilliance of proletarian fighters always shone on them. Kuang Zhangda, who joined the Red Army in 1932, is now the head of the Red Army Steel Plant in Yongxin County, Jiangxi Province, which was established during the Great Leap Forward last year. Last year, together with many veteran Red Army soldiers who had experienced hundreds of battles, he smelted more than 170 tons of pig iron for the country. This year, they guarantee to overfulfill the production target of 1,700 tons of iron. Kuang Zhangda introduced at the meeting that when the Red Army Steel Plant was first built, Li Ruifeng, a veteran Red Army soldier who had participated in five counter-encirclement campaigns, was injured in battle and had one foot amputated, but he also participated in digging the soil. When he was tired, he would sit down and dig, and his labor efficiency was almost the same as that of people with complete limbs. When others advised him to rest, he said nonchalantly that this was far less difficult than the counter-encirclement campaigns. The exemplary deeds of the veteran Red Army soldiers have spread throughout the countryside. Fang Heming, a veteran Red Army regiment commander, immediately began producing with local farmers after returning to his hometown of Hongan County, Hubei Province, in 1949. During the upsurge of collectivization in 1955, he took the lead in organizing local poor and lower-middle peasants to form agricultural cooperatives. During the Great Leap Forward, he actively participated in steel smelting and planting experimental fields. In his speech, he guaranteed that he would work at least 250 labor days this year, actively publicize the Party's policies, and lead the masses to strive for a continued leap forward in agricultural production this year.

The father of internationalist fighter Luo Shengjiao, Luo Diekai, Liu Hulan's mother Hu Wenxiu, and "Glorious Mother" Shen Meiying, whose two sons were sacrificed for the revolution, not only dedicated their children to the cause of the Party and the people, but also remained enthusiastic and energetic in socialist construction. Their speeches at the meeting gave everyone great encouragement. Luo Diekai, Hu Wenxiu, and Shen Meiying are all old, but they all said in their speeches that they are now living younger and younger. In the Great Leap Forward in agricultural production last year and in the new production upsurge in the countryside this year, they did not avoid wind and rain, took the lead in labor, and actively carried out propaganda and mobilization work under the leadership of the Party, and made great achievements together with the masses. Since this spring, Luo Diekai has received first-class awards from the commune production team three times for his good labor. Hu Wenxiu took the lead in organizing a women's manure collection team last winter and this spring. In two months, she collected more than 150 loads of manure alone, and the whole team collected more than 100,000 catties of manure. With the support of the Party, she also actively participated in organizing kindergartens and nurseries, so that more than 50 mothers could work with peace of mind. In their speeches, they all said that for the beautiful life of the people across the country, for the glorious cause of the Party, for their dead children, and for their living children, they will always stand at the forefront of the battle. The venue resounded with warm applause time and time again, expressing the highest respect to the glorious families of martyrs.

The speeches of the three disabled soldiers' representatives fully demonstrated their revolutionary optimistic spirit of being disabled but not losing their ambition. Liu Yukun joined the New Fourth Army in 1942. His eyes were damaged by enemy artillery shells in the War of Liberation. Now he is the Party Branch Secretary of the Guoqing Production Brigade of the Liuji People's Commune in Yizheng County, Jiangsu Province. In two years, Liu Yukun studied dozens of books such as "On the Cultivation of Communist Party Members," "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship," and "History of Social Development." Since 1957, he has given Party lectures to Party members once a month without interruption. Liu Yukun has a very close relationship with the masses. He often visits farmers' homes and uses his disability allowance to help families in difficulty. The local people praised Liu Yukun as "the Paul of Yizheng County." Li Laicai, a disabled soldier working at the Boai Mechanized Farm in Henan Province, stubbornly learned to drive a giant tractor despite losing both feet. During the Great Leap Forward last year, he actively studied and transformed a semi-automatic corn seeder into a fully automatic corn seeder using waste materials, greatly improving work efficiency. Pan Qifu, a disabled soldier in Anhui Province, lost both legs in the war and is now still serving as the Party General Branch Secretary of the Xiage Commune in Chaoxian County. He also stubbornly participated in production with the masses, demonstrating an amazing iron will.

Zhu Hengchang, the director of the Military Dependents Sundries Factory in Harbin City, Heilongjiang Province, and three other military dependents established this factory in 1955. Thanks to the government's help and their hard work, it has now developed into a factory with more than 150 employees and capable of producing more than 100 kinds of products. Zhu Hengchang introduced in his speech that because the revolutionary martyrs' families who participated in the work of this factory had demonstrated soaring enthusiasm in the Great Leap Forward in 1958, they had used all kinds of waste products such as broken oilcloth, broken tin sheets, and broken sacks to create more than 30 new products and overfulfilled last year's production plan by 300%. With the development of production, the average salary of employees has also increased from 21 yuan per month when the factory was first established to 52 yuan. This year, Zhu Hengchang and others also guaranteed to double the factory's total output value several times as a gift to the 10th anniversary of the National Day. Xing Defu and Huang Meiqiu, representatives of military dependents from Liaoning Province and the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, also introduced at the meeting their achievements in actively leading the masses to reform rural production tools and organizing rural women to participate in labor.

Song Shichun, Gao Fuyou, Han Fengming, Shen Zaifu, Hu Qinggui, Lian Shihai, Zhu Shiqi, Zhu Mingfu, Li Changgui, Zhan Zhongchun, and other demobilized or transferred military personnel representatives from Inner Mongolia, Gansu, Hebei, Beijing, Qinghai, Shandong, Sichuan, Shaanxi, Yunnan, Jilin, etc., either reported on their own achievements in the Great Leap Forward to the conference or introduced the situation of demobilized and transferred military personnel in their areas actively participating in socialist construction. Song Shichun, the leader of the Youth Rocket Tank Group of Baotou Steel, and a demobilized soldier, together with all the members of the group, increased the daily lifting capacity of the crane from 30 tons to 540 tons in the Great Leap Forward last year, increasing work efficiency by 17 times and completing five years of work in six months. Among the 10,008 models selected at the Zhongliang Canal Water Conservancy Project in Gansu Province, where Gao Fuyou works, 36 were demobilized soldiers. The speeches of all these representatives at the conference fully demonstrated that the demobilized and transferred military personnel active on all fronts are now pioneers in construction.

    在烈军属和残废复员退伍转业军人积极分子大会上
    英雄人物汇报英雄事迹
    薄一波谢觉哉勉励代表们作出更大成绩
    新华社22日讯　在全国烈属、军属和残废、复员、退伍、转业军人社会主义建设积极分子大会上，来自祖国各地的代表在20日和22日的大会发言中汇报了他们在大跃进中创立的功绩。他们的发言充满对党的无限忠心，表明了他们在社会主义革命和社会主义建设中都是优秀的战士。
    国务院副总理薄一波和最高人民法院院长谢觉哉，先后在21日和22日的大会上讲话，热烈祝贺代表们对党的事业作出的重大贡献，勉励他们在继续大跃进中作出更大成绩。
    一千多位代表怀着尊敬的心情，热烈鼓掌欢迎老红军旷章大、方和明在大会上发言。旷章大和方和明过去对革命作出了很大贡献，他们退休后仍然以普通劳动者自居，艰苦朴素，联系群众，在他们身上始终闪烁无产阶级战士的光辉。1932年参加红军的旷章大，现在是去年大跃进中建立起来的江西省永新县红军钢铁厂的负责人。去年，他同这个厂的许多身经百战的老红军战士一起，为国家炼出了一百七十多吨生铁。今年，他们保证要超额完成一千七百吨铁的生产指标。旷章大在会上介绍说，红军钢铁厂初建的时候，曾经参加过五次反围剿的老红军李瑞风，过去在战斗中负伤，被锯掉了一只脚，但也参加挖土，挖累了就坐下来挖，他的劳动效率和手脚完整的人差不多。别人劝他休息，他却毫不在乎地说，这比起反围剿的战斗还差得远呢。老红军们的模范事迹，已经传遍乡里。老红军团长方和明自从1949年回到他的家乡湖北省红安县以后，立刻就同当地农民一起生产。1955年的合作化高潮中，他首先发动当地的贫雇农成立了农业社。在大跃进中，他又积极参加炼钢和种试验田。他在发言中保证自己今年最少要做二百五十个劳动日，并且积极宣传党的政策，带动群众争取今年农业生产继续跃进。
    国际主义战士罗盛教的父亲罗迭开、刘胡兰的母亲胡文秀和两个儿子都为革命牺牲了的“光荣妈妈”沈美英，他们不但为党和人民的事业献出了自己的子女，并且在社会主义建设中始终热情洋溢，干劲冲天。他们在大会上的发言，给了大家很大鼓舞。罗迭开、胡文秀、沈美英都已上了年纪，但他们在发言中都说，他们现在却越活越年轻了。在去年的农业生产大跃进中，在今年农村新的生产高潮中，他们都不避风雨，带头劳动，并且在党的领导下积极进行宣传鼓动工作，同群众一起做出了很大的成绩。今春以来，罗迭开由于劳动得好，已经三次得到公社生产队的甲等奖励。胡文秀在去冬今春带头组织妇女积肥队，两个月中她一个人就拾粪一百五十多担，全队积肥十万多斤。她还在党的支持下积极参加组织幼儿园和托儿所，使得五十多位母亲能安心生产。他们在发言中都说，为了全国人民的美好生活，为了党的光荣事业，为了死去的儿女们，为了活着的孩子们，他们将永远站在战斗的最前列。会场上一次又一次响起热烈的掌声，向光荣的烈士家属表示最崇高的敬意。
    三位残废军人代表的发言，充分表现了他们身残志不残的革命乐观主义精神。刘玉坤1942年参加新四军，在解放战争中被敌人炮弹炸坏了双眼，现在是江苏省仪征县刘集人民公社国庆生产大队的党支部书记。在两年内，刘玉坤学习了论共产党员的修养、论人民民主专政、社会发展史等几十本书。从1957年开始，他每月给党员们上一次党课，从不间断。刘玉坤同群众的关系十分亲密，他经常到农民家中去访问，把他的残废补助金拿出来帮助有困难的人家。当地群众都赞扬刘玉坤是“仪征县的保尔”。在河南省博爱机耕农场工作的残废军人李来财，虽已失去双足，仍然顽强地学会了驾驶巨型拖拉机。在去年大跃进中，他积极钻研，把一台半自动玉米播种机利用废料改装成完全自动的玉米播种机，使工作效率大大提高。安徽省残废军人潘启富虽然在战争中失去了双腿，现在还担任着巢县夏阁公社的党总支书记。并且顽强地同群众一起参加生产，表现了惊人的钢铁意志。
    黑龙江省哈尔滨市军属杂品工厂厂长朱恒昌所在的这个工厂，1955年由朱恒昌等三位军属建立起来，由于政府的帮助和他们的辛勤劳动，现在已经发展成为一个拥有一百五十多名职工和能够生产一百多种产品的工厂。朱恒昌在大会发言中介绍说，由于参加这个工厂工作的烈军属们在1958年的大跃进中发挥了冲天干劲，他们曾经利用破油布、破洋铁片、破麻袋等种种废品，创造出新产品三十多种，超额300％完成去年的生产计划。随着生产的发展，职工平均工资也由工厂初建立时的每月二十一元增加到五十二元。今年，朱恒昌他们还保证要把工厂的生产总值再翻几番，作为向国庆十周年的献礼。来自辽宁省和广西僮族自治区的军属代表邢德福和黄美秋，也在大会上介绍了他们积极带动群众改革农村生产工具和组织农村妇女参加劳动的成绩。
    分别来自内蒙、甘肃、河北、北京、青海、山东、四川、陕西、云南、吉林等地的复员或转业军人代表宋世纯、高富有、韩凤鸣、申载富、胡庆贵、连世海、朱士奇、朱明富、李长贵、战仲春等人，有的向大会汇报了他们自己在大跃进中创造的成绩，有的介绍了他们所在地区的复员、转业军人积极参加社会主义建设的情况。包钢青年火箭号坦克组组长、复员军人宋世纯，在去年大跃进中同全体组员一起把吊车的日吊量由三十吨增加到五百四十吨，提高工作效率十七倍，六个月内就完成了五年的工作任务。在高富有所在的甘肃省中梁渠水利工地上，评选出的一万零八名模范中，就有三十六人是复员军人。所有这些代表在大会上的发言都充分表明，活跃在各个战线上的复员、转业军人现在都是建设中的尖兵。
