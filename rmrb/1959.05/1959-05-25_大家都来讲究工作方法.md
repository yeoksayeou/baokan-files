In all lines of work and in all tasks, there are many working methods. However, they cannot deviate from two important principles: first, the mass line, which means acting according to the opinions of the majority of the masses; second, specific problems should be handled specifically, which means acting according to objective possibilities. We advocate the working method of the mass line, the working method of persuasion and education, and oppose commandism and crude, oppressive working methods. Because all the undertakings of the Communists are the cause of the people, and all work must mobilize the masses to consciously carry it out. The creativity of the people is inexhaustible, and the people are the creators of history. We can only be invincible if we rely on the people. If we do not believe in the power of the masses in our work, taking everything into our own hands and not enlightening the masses but issuing commands, we are bound to run into snags. From the revolution and construction of a region, without the conscious action of the broad masses, victory cannot be achieved; down to the popularization of close-planting measures for rice in a locality, if we do not adopt the mass line working methods of airing views, debating, persuading, educating, and demonstrating, the masses will hardly accept it, and even if they accept it reluctantly, they will not actively implement it. We advocate the working method of dealing with specific problems specifically, and oppose the working method of bureaucracy and subjectivism. Because work is about solving the specific contradictions in the development of objective things, and specific problems cannot be solved without specific analysis of specific things and the adoption of practical and specific methods. To solve specific problems, it is necessary to prescribe the right medicine for the disease. If we do not make a diagnosis and use one prescription for all symptoms, accidents are bound to happen. Chairman Mao said in his article "On Contradiction": "Superficiality means not looking at the characteristics of the contradiction as a whole and the characteristics of each of its aspects; it means denying the necessity of probing deeply into the details of a contradiction and of studying its characteristics, but instead merely looking from afar and, after seeing the rough outline, immediately trying to resolve the contradiction (answering questions, settling disputes, handling work, or directing a military operation). Such a way of doing things is sure to lead to trouble." This kind of bureaucratic and subjectivist working method is, of course, not what we adopt.

The key to learning correct working methods lies in seriously studying the instructions of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, carefully listening to the opinions of the masses, and conscientiously studying the experiences and lessons in our own and other people's work. Facts have proved that mastering correct working methods is not impossible. Wasn't it during the Great Leap Forward of 1958 that we gradually learned famous working methods such as putting politics in command, walking on two legs, planting experimental fields, and holding on-the-spot meetings under the teachings of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao?

China's socialist construction is developing more and more, the content of work is becoming more and more complex, and the work should also be done more and more carefully. We need to pay more attention to working methods in our work. Without correct leadership styles and working methods, it is impossible to rapidly launch mass movements on the economic front. In order to build socialism in a faster, better, and more economical way, and to realize the continued Great Leap Forward in 1959, we should further study working methods, summarize advanced working methods, promote advanced working methods, and learn advanced working methods.

### 大家都来讲究工作方法

    大家都来讲究工作方法
    各行、各业、各项工作上的工作方法很多，但是，它们都不能离开两条重要的原则：一是群众路线，也就是按照大多数群众意见办事。一是具体问题，具体处理，也就是按照客观可能性办事。我们提倡群众路线的工作方法，说服教育的工作方法，反对命令主义，粗暴、压服的工作方法。因为共产党人的一切事业，都是人民群众的事业，一切工作都必须发动群众自觉地进行，人民群众的创造力是无穷无尽的，人民群众是历史的创造者，我们只有依靠了人民群众，才无往而不胜。做工作如果不相信群众的力量，包办代替，不启发群众的觉悟，命令行事，那是没有不碰钉子的。大至一个地区的革命与建设，没有广大群众的自觉行动，就不能取得胜利；小至一地推广水稻密植措施，如果不采取鸣放、辩论、说服、教育、示范的群众路线的工作方法，群众就难以接受，勉强接受了，也不会积极实行。我们提倡具体问题具体处理的工作方法，反对官僚主义、主观主义的工作方法。因为，做工作就是解决客观事物发展中的具体矛盾，不对具体事物作具体分析和采取实际的具体的方法，是不能够解决具体问题的。解决具体问题要对症下药，如果不作诊断，百样症候，一张药方，一定要出事故。毛主席在“矛盾论”一文中说：“表面性，是对矛盾总体和矛盾各方的特点都不去看，否认深入事物里面精细地研究矛盾特点的必要，仅仅站在那里远远地望一望，粗枝大叶地看到一点矛盾的形象，就想动手去解决矛盾（答复问题、解决纠纷、处理工作、指挥战争）。这样的做法，没有不出乱子的。”这种官僚主义、主观主义的工作方法，当然是我们所不取的。
    学习正确的工作方法的关键在于认真地学习党中央和毛主席的指示，认真地倾听群众的意见，认真地研究自己和别地工作中的经验教训。事实证明，掌握正确的工作方法并不是办不到的，1958年的大跃进，我们不就是在党中央和毛主席的教导下，逐步学会了政治挂帅、用两条腿走路、种试验田、开现场会等等著名的工作方法吗？
    我国的社会主义建设愈来愈发展，工作内容愈来愈复杂了，工作也应当愈做愈细致，我们在工作中也更加需要讲究工作方法。如果没有正确的领导方式和工作方法，要迅速开展经济战线上的群众运动是不可能的。为了多快好省地建设社会主义，为了实现1959年的继续大跃进，我们更应该进一步研究工作方法，总结先进的工作方法，推广先进的工作方法，学习先进的工作方法。
