　　Reach a Higher Level

　　As a rising star in small blast furnace production, Yunnan Province has joined Anhui, Jiangsu, and other provinces in the ranks of advanced areas in the national small blast furnace production, achieving brilliant results in the widespread bumper harvest of small blast furnaces throughout the province.

　　Yunnan Province does not have any special advantageous conditions. Their basic experience is that the Party committee attaches importance to it, takes action personally, and conscientiously implements the “Technical Measures Program for Small Blast Furnaces” adopted by the National Small Blast Furnace Conference, and also summarizes its own experience. As a result, output and quality have gradually increased.

　　Yunnan's achievements are significant; we hope that all employees of small blast furnaces in Yunnan will continue to make persistent efforts, continue to improve pig iron quality and utilization coefficient, and strive to reach a higher level and create greater achievements.

    百尺竿头再进一步
    作为小高炉生产的后起之秀，云南省已经和安徽、江苏等省一起迈进了全国小高炉生产的先进行列，获得了全省小高炉大面积丰收的辉煌战果。
    云南省并没有什么特殊的有利的条件，他们的一条基本经验，是党委重视，亲自动手，认真地贯彻执行了全国小高炉会议所通过的
  “小高炉技术措施方案”，又总结了自己的经验，因而产量、质量逐步上升。
    云南的成绩是巨大的；我们希望云南小高炉全体职工再接再厉，继续提高生铁质量和利用系数，百尺竿头，再进一步，为创造更大成绩而努力。
