Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, 28th: Yuxi Prefecture in Yunnan Province is implementing a rapid harvesting, planting, requisition, and warehousing system, making it a leader in the province in the summer grain and oil harvest, requisition, and summer rice planting.

As of May 25th, 92% of the summer grain and oil crops in the region have been harvested; the amount of oil and grain stored in warehouses accounts for 62.5% and 15% of the requisition tasks, respectively; and the rice planting has completed 53% of the plan, an increase of 11% over the same period last year. The corn planting plan has already been overfulfilled.

Yuxi Prefecture is one of the main producing areas of wheat and rapeseed in Yunnan Province. Most of the 780,000 mu of spring crops in the region must be harvested before the end of May, which is also the season for large-scale rice planting. As early as March, when wheat turned green and rapeseed bloomed, the Yuxi Prefectural Party Committee arranged the summer harvest and requisition work, established a grain office, and carried out warehouse cleaning and disinfection. Subsequently, field headquarters were established from the prefecture and county levels to the commune and even production team levels, led by the secretaries of party organizations at all levels to lead the masses in harvesting and planting.

In the requisition work, the Yuxi Prefectural Party Committee designated special personnel to be responsible and inspected it every other day; each county inspected it every day, and helped the masses solve problems at any time. The financial and trade departments and grain departments of the prefecture also sent people to go deep into the countryside to help communes and production teams arrange labor, and promptly thresh, dry, and sell grain into storage.

Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, 28th: People's communes in Hainan Island, Guangdong Province, are actively implementing the method of harvesting, selling, and storing grain simultaneously, and quickly sending the summer grain requisitioned by the state into warehouses. As of the 23rd of this month, 7,510,000 jin of grain has been put into storage.

Many communes have properly arranged labor and transportation, and completed the state's summer requisition and purchase tasks in one go. Yaxian County, which harvested the earliest summer crops, implemented simultaneous harvesting, delivery, and warehousing, and sent nearly 3 million jin of summer grain that should be delivered to the state granary very early. Dapo Brigade of Jiaji Commune and Futang Brigade of Longfu Commune in Qionghai County completed the state requisition task in one day. Huangliu Commune in Ledong County, which had just begun summer harvesting, was personally organized and led by the first secretary of the Party committee. With the assistance of railway troops stationed there who sent trucks to help, they seized the time to send grain into warehouses at night. From the 19th to the 21st of this month alone, the grain sent to the state warehouse was equivalent to 83% of the requisition task; and seven brigades overfulfilled the warehousing task.

In the delivery of summer grain, many communes put forward the slogan "Good grain is sent into the warehouse, and bad grain does not leave the village." The grain delivered to the state is generally dried, cleaned, and has full grains.

Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, 28th: After harvesting rapeseed, the Yangying Management Area of Chengguan People's Commune in Xixiang County, Shaanxi Province, sold more than 80,600 jin of rapeseed to the state.

This year, the Yangying Management Area planted 836 mu of rapeseed. At present, except for a few late-maturing Shengli rapeseed that have not been completely harvested, the rest have been fully harvested and dried.

After selling rapeseed to the state, the production teams in this management area have all purchased summer planting tools and paid wages to the commune members with the cash income. After purchasing production tools and paying wages, some production teams also deposited the remaining money in the bank for savings. (Attached picture)

    玉溪夏粮收种购三路领先
    海南岛农民一鼓作气送粮入库

    新华社昆明28日电　云南省玉溪专区实行快收快种快征购快入库，夏收粮油的收获、征购和夏季水稻的栽插工作，在全省都是领先。
    到5月25日为止，全区已有92％的夏收粮油作物收割完毕；入库的油料和粮食，分别占征购任务的62.5％和15％；水稻栽插完成了计划的53％，比去年同期增加11％，包谷播种计划已经超额完成。
    玉溪专区是云南省小麦、油菜的主要产区之一。全区七十八万多亩小春作物，大部分要在5月底以前收割完毕，而这时又正是大面积栽播水稻的季节。中共玉溪地委早在3月份小麦返青、油菜开花的时候，就对夏收和征购工作作了安排，成立了粮食办公室，并且进行清仓消毒。接着，从专区、县到公社甚至生产队，都成立了田间指挥部，由各级党组织书记挂帅领导群众收割栽播。
    在征购工作中，中共玉溪地委指定专人负责，每隔一天检查一次；各县每天检查一次，发现问题，随时帮助群众解决。专区的财贸部门和粮食部门也派人深入农村，帮助公社、生产队安排劳动力，及时打晒和交售入库。
    新华社广州28日电　广东省海南岛各地人民公社积极实行边收边售边入库的办法，迅速把国家征购的夏粮送入仓库。到本月23日止，已入库粮食七百五十一万斤。
    许多公社妥善地安排了劳动力和运输力量，一鼓作气地完成了国家夏征夏购任务。夏收季节最早的崖县实行边收获、边交售、边入库，很早就把应该交售的近三百万斤夏粮送入国家粮库。琼海县嘉积公社大坡大队和龙福公社福塘大队，一天内就分别完成了国家征购任务。才开始夏收不久的乐东县黄流公社，由党委第一书记亲自组织领导，取得当地铁道部队派出载重汽车援助，利用晚上的时间抓紧送粮入库，仅在本月19日至21日的三天内，送入国家仓库的粮食就相当于征购任务的83％；并且有七个大队超额完成了入库任务。
    在交售夏粮中，许多公社提出了“好粮送入库，坏粮不出村”的口号。交售给国家的粮食一般做到晒干、扬净、籽粒饱满。
    新华社西安28日电　陕西西乡县城关人民公社杨营管理区在收割油菜后，出售给国家八万零六百多斤油菜籽。
    杨营管理区今年种植油菜八百三十六亩，目前，除少数成熟较晚的胜利油菜尚未完全收割外，其余的已全部收割上场，并且打净晒干。
    这个管理区的各生产队在向国家出售油菜籽后，都纷纷把收入的现金购买夏种工具并给社员们发放工资。有的生产队在购买生产工具和发工资后，还把余款放进银行里储蓄起来。（附图片）
