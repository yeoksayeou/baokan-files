Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, 4th. After the full text of Indian Prime Minister Nehru's speech on the situation in Tibet delivered on April 27th in the Indian People's Assembly was published in the local newspapers, people from all walks of life paid close attention and held discussions to study it seriously.

Kang Jiakun, a famous red banner bearer on the industrial front in Wuhan, said: Prime Minister Nehru described the solemn counterattack of the Chinese people against foreign interventionists as "disregarding the truth and etiquette and using the language of the Cold War," while he described the slander of China by many Indian politicians and newspapers over the past month as "not political." This is truly strange logic. Kang Jiakun said: Our people's counterattack against foreign intervention is completely just. As long as foreign interventionists do not stop their intervention and conspiracies, we will not stop our just counterattack.

Xiao Jingman, National Model Agricultural Laborer and Director of the Huaguang People's Commune in Echeng, said: In his speech, Nehru said that the basis of the Tibetan rebellion was "strong nationalist sentiment" and that the words and deeds of Indian expansionists in interfering in our country's internal affairs were "not political," but were what he called "sympathy based on emotion and humanitarian reasons." These statements are truly disregarding the facts and etiquette. Everyone in the world knows that Tibet is an inseparable part of Chinese territory, and the patriotic people of Tibet support the Party's and the government's ethnic policies. However, Indian expansionists support the Tibetan rebellion and attempt to undermine our country's unity and ethnic solidarity. Isn't this interference in our internal affairs? Indian expansionists even publicly insulted the image of our leader Chairman Mao. Isn't this a political issue? Nehru does not sympathize with the vast Tibetan people but sympathizes with and supports that small handful of inhuman jackals. Is this Mr. Nehru's "humanitarian" standard?

Responsible persons from the Wuhan local organizations of various democratic parties, the Wuhan Federation of Industry and Commerce, the Overseas Chinese Federation, religious groups, and representatives of ethnic minorities held a discussion on the 3rd. Hu Wenyu, Vice Chairman of the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the China Association for Promoting Democracy, said: Our suppression of the rebellion launched by a small handful of reactionary elements of the upper class in Tibet brought a new life to the Tibetan people. This is a great happy event, but Nehru described it as a "tragedy," which is puzzling. Xu Xuexuan, Deputy Director of the Municipal Federation of Industry and Commerce, pointed out: The leaders of the Tibetan rebels are the most reactionary serf owners in Tibet and long-term lackeys cultivated by British imperialism. They want to maintain the dark serf system forever, cruelly exploit and oppress the people, collude with foreign countries, betray the motherland, and launch an armed rebellion with the support of imperialists and Indian expansionists. This is a well-known fact. Nehru, however, described it as "strong nationalist sentiment." Isn't this an excuse for Indian interventionists and Tibetan rebels? Lu Jingcheng, a Standing Committee Member of the Wuhan Municipal Committee of the Chinese Peasants' and Workers' Democratic Party, refuted Nehru's view that the slanderous remarks made by some Indian politicians and newspapers against the Chinese people to interfere in our internal affairs were "not political in nature." He said that Mrs. Indira Gandhi, President of the Indian National Congress, described the Tibet region of China as a "country," and Mehta, the leader of the Indian People's Socialist Party, said that India and Tibet have a "mother-child relationship." The leaders of the People's Socialist Party also expressed their intention to inherit the mantle of British imperialism, saying that independent India "enjoys the monopoly right to develop that country (Tibet)." Indian newspapers published lengthy news and articles that slandered the Chinese people, using the Tibet issue to wantonly attack the Chinese people, sow discord between China and India, and attempt to split Tibet from Chinese territory. Not satisfied with these Cold War languages, some people even used "hot war" language, proposing to organize a "volunteer army" to support the Tibetan rebels and clamoring that "if India is attacked by China..., it must defend itself." Indian expansionists are frantic in their attempt to split China and achieve their expansionist goal of "inheriting" British imperialism's "monopoly rights" to "develop" Tibet. These facts are obvious to the world. Nehru said that it "is not political." He asked Nehru: To what extent does Indian expansionist interference in China's internal affairs have to reach before it becomes political? Tang Changru, Deputy Director of the Wuhan Branch of the Jiusan Society, pointed out that the Chinese people's appropriate counterattack against Indian interventionists to defend the unity of the motherland and keep their minds clear is completely just. What does this have in common with Nehru's "Cold War language"?

Xinhua News Agency, 5th. After preliminary study and discussion of Indian Prime Minister Nehru's speech on April 27th regarding the situation in Tibet, the people of the capital Beijing believe that this speech distorts the truth about the Tibetan rebellion and defends the words and deeds of those in India who interfere in our internal affairs.

The people participating in this study and discussion came from a wide range and had a national character. They compared many of the arguments made by Nehru in this speech with the facts.

In his speech, Nehru described the slanderous remarks made by some Indian politicians and newspapers over the past month, which were blatant interference in our internal affairs, as something "not political in nature" and "mainly a sympathy based on emotion and humanitarian reasons." Shi Ce, a teacher at the Institute of International Relations, refuted this statement that disregarded the facts in the discussion. Shi Ce said: Indian expansionists say that "India and Tibet have a mother-child relationship," clamor for "Tibetan independence," want Tibet to become a "buffer state," and want a "roundtable conference on the Tibetan issue" to be "convened by India," etc., and have organized many gatherings and various institutions to interfere in our internal affairs and support Tibetan rebels. Can this be said to be "not political"? Mrs. Kriplani, Secretary-General of the National Congress Party, also described Tibet as an "autonomous country" and expressed full sympathy for the "just cause" of the Tibetan rebels. Mrs. Pandit, a senior Indian official in London and Nehru's sister, also said: "I am not interested in China's rule over Tibet... I care about whether Tibet, India, and other countries have the ability to resist the ruling country." Isn't this political incitement? Indian officials personally distributed the so-called "Dalai Lama's statement," and the official gazettes of some Indian embassies abroad formally published this so-called statement and distributed it to the host countries; the Indian People's Assembly openly wants to discuss the so-called Tibetan issue. If this is not "political," then what is it? In his own speeches, Nehru once said that "Tibetans are different from Chinese, and Chinese are Han people." Even in this speech in the People's Assembly, he discussed the Tibet issue in our country as if he were discussing India's internal affairs. May I ask Mr. Nehru, are these not all "political" issues? Shi Ce asked in the discussion: If a similar rebellion occurred in a certain state in India, would a friendly neighboring country with the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence brutally interfere in India's internal affairs in this way?

Who exactly is "disregarding the truth and etiquette and using the language of the Cold War"? Wei Lin, a steelworker at the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Company, said in the discussion that before and after the open armed rebellion launched by the reactionary elements of the upper class in Tibet, more than a dozen Indian newspapers concentrated on slandering and defaming our country. At that time, we did not see any counterattacks against these slanders and defamations in our newspapers. This is understandable. In order not to "make those close to us grieve and those who hate us rejoice," our public opinion circles were waiting for these people to become aware of themselves. However, our restraint was regarded by Indian interventionists as weakness and vulnerability. Not only did they not restrain themselves, but they became more and more frantic and more and more blatant in interfering in China's internal affairs. It was at this time that we Chinese people, in order to explain the truth and prevent foreigners from interfering in our internal affairs, carried out a just and stern counterattack. However, in his speech, Nehru praised the language of Indian interventionists, who violated the Five Principles and interfered in our internal affairs, as "mainly a sympathy based on emotion and humanitarian reasons," and described our people's just counterattack as "disregarding the truth and etiquette" and "using the language of the Cold War." Wang Chuanhua, a worker at Xuanwu Weaving Factory, said that Indian interventionists held demonstrations, drew cartoons, and threw tomatoes to insult our great leader. This is no longer the language of the Cold War, but the actions of the Cold War.

### 奇怪的逻辑　奇怪的标准  北京武汉各界人士座谈尼赫鲁的讲话

　　奇怪的逻辑　奇怪的标准
    北京武汉各界人士座谈尼赫鲁的讲话
    据新华社武汉4日电　印度总理尼赫鲁4月27日在印度人民院就西藏局势问题发表的讲话在此间报纸全文发表后，各界人民都非常注意，并纷纷举行座谈会加以认真研究。
    武汉市工业战线上著名的红旗手康家坤说：尼赫鲁总理把中国人民对外国干涉者所进行的严正的反击说成是“不顾事实真相和礼节，并且使用了冷战的语言”，而把印度许多政治家和报纸对中国一个多月来的诽谤倒说成“没有政治性”，这真是一种奇怪的逻辑。康家坤说：我国人民反击外国干涉完全是正义的，外国干涉者一天不停止干涉和阴谋活动，我们就一天不停止正义的反击。
    全国农业劳动模范、鄂城华光人民公社主任萧敬满说：尼赫鲁在讲话中说西藏叛乱的基础是什么“强烈的民族主义情绪”，并把印度扩张主义分子干涉我国内政的言行说成“不是政治性的”，而是什么“基于感情和人道原因的同情”。这些说法，才真正是不顾事实和礼貌。世界上什么人都知道，西藏是中国领土不可分割的一部分，西藏爱国人民都拥护党和政府的民族政策，可是印度扩张主义分子却支持西藏叛乱，企图破坏我国统一和民族团结，这不是干涉我国内政是什么呢？印度扩张主义分子还公然侮辱我国领袖毛主席的像，这不是政治性问题是什么呢？尼赫鲁不同情广大西藏人民，却去同情和支持那一小撮灭绝人性的豺狼，这就是尼赫鲁先生的“人道”标准吗？
    各民主党派武汉市地方组织和武汉市工商联、侨联、宗教团体等方面的负责人士和少数民族代表，在3日举行了座谈会。民主促进会武汉市委员会副主委胡文裕说：我们平定西藏上层一小撮反动分子发动的叛乱，为西藏人民带来了新生，这是一件大喜事，而尼赫鲁却说成是“悲剧”，这不能不令人感到难解。市工商联副主任委员徐雪轩指出：西藏叛乱分子的头目都是西藏最反动的大农奴主，同时又是英帝国主义长期豢养的走狗，他们想永远保持黑暗的农奴制度，残酷地剥削和压迫人民，他们里通外国，背叛祖国，在帝国主义和印度扩张主义分子的支持下发动了武装叛乱，这是人所共知的事实。而尼赫鲁却说成是“强烈的民族主义情绪”，这不正是为印度干涉者和西藏叛乱分子在作辩解吗？农工民主党武汉市委常委卢镜澄驳斥了尼赫鲁认为印度一些政界人士和报刊对中国人民使用诽谤性言论干涉我国内政的行径“实质上不是政治性的”说法。他说，印度国大党主席英迪拉·甘地夫人把中国西藏地方说成是一个“国家”，印度人民社会党首领梅达说印度和西藏是“母子关系”，人民社会党领袖还表示要继承英帝国主义的衣钵，说什么独立以后的印度“享有发展那个国家（西藏）的垄断权利”，印度的报刊发出了连篇累牍污蔑中国人民的消息和文章，利用西藏问题放肆地攻击中国人民，挑拨中印关系，企图使西藏从中国领土中分裂出去，用这些冷战语言犹嫌不足，竟有人使用“热战”语言，提出要组织“志愿军”支援西藏叛匪，并扬言什么“如果印度遭到来自中国……的进攻就要进行自卫”。印度扩张主义分子为了分裂中国，为了达到他们“继承”英帝国主义“发展”西藏的“垄断权”的扩张目的，竟热到发狂的地步。这些事实世人有目共睹。而尼赫鲁竟说那“不是政治性的”，他问尼赫鲁：印度扩张主义分子干涉中国内政达到什么程度才是政治性的呢？九三学社武汉分社副主任委员唐长儒指出，中国人民为了捍卫祖国的统一，对印度干涉者给以应有的反击，使他们头脑清醒点，是完全正义的，这和尼赫鲁所说的“冷战语言”有何共同之处？
    据新华社5日讯　首都北京人民在初步研究和讨论了印度总理尼赫鲁4月27日就我国西藏局势发表的讲话以后认为，这个讲话歪曲了西藏叛乱事件的真相，并且为印度的那些干涉我国内政的言行辩护。
    参加这项研究和讨论的人范围很广，具有全民的性质。他们对尼赫鲁在这篇讲话中所提出的许多论点，都用事实作了对照。
    尼赫鲁在讲话中，把过去一个多月来印度的一些政界人士和报刊发表的蛮横干涉我国内政的诽谤性的言论，说成是一种“实质上不是政治性的”，“主要是一种基于情感和人道原因的同情”。国际关系学院教师世策在讨论中批驳了这种不顾事实的说法。世策说：印度扩张主义分子说什么“印度和西藏是母子关系”，叫嚷“西藏独立”，要使西藏成为“缓冲国家”，要由“印度召集”“西藏问题的圆桌会议”等等，并且组织了许多干涉我国内政的集会和各种机构来支援西藏叛乱分子，这能说不是“政治性”的吗？国大党总书记克里帕拉尼夫人也把西藏说成是一个“自治国家”，并且表示完全同情西藏叛乱分子的“正义事业”，印度驻伦敦高级官员、尼赫鲁的妹妹潘迪特夫人也说：“我对中国统治西藏不感兴趣。……我关心的是西藏、印度和其它国家是否有能力起来抵抗进行统治的国家”。这难道不是政治性的煽动吗？印度官员亲自散发所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”，印度某些驻外使馆的官方公报正式刊登了这个所谓声明并向驻在国散发；印度的人民院公然要讨论所谓西藏问题，这不是“政治性”又是什么呢？尼赫鲁在自己的谈话中，也曾说过什么“西藏人不同于中国人，中国人是汉人”，直到这次在人民院的讲话中就像谈论印度的内政一样谈论我国的西藏问题，试问尼赫鲁先生，这些难道不都是“政治性”的问题吗？世策在讨论中提出反问：如果印度某个邦也发生了类似西藏叛乱的事情，有着五项原则协议的友好邻国能这样来粗暴地干涉印度的内政吗？
    究竟是谁“不顾事实真相和礼节，使用了冷战的语言”？石景山钢铁公司炼钢工人魏林在讨论中说，干涉者在西藏上层反动分子公开发动武装叛乱前后，印度十几家报纸集中诬蔑诽谤我国，当时，我们并没有在我国的报纸上看到对这些诬蔑和诽谤的回击。这是可以理解的，为了不让“亲者所痛仇者所快”，我国的舆论界在等待这些人的自觉。但是，我们的这种克制，反而被印度干涉者认为软弱可欺，他们不但不有所收敛，反而愈来愈疯狂，愈来愈明目张胆地干涉起中国的内政来了。就是在这个时候，我们中国人民，为了说明事实的真相，不让外国人干涉自己的内政，才进行了义正词严的反击。可是尼赫鲁在讲话中，把印度干涉者破坏五项原则干涉我国内政的语言，赞扬为“主要是一种基于情感和人道原因的同情”，而把我国人民正义的反击，说成是“不顾事实真相和礼节”是“使用了冷战的语言”。宣武织布厂工人王传华说，印度干涉者们搞游行、画漫画、扔西红柿侮辱我们伟大的领袖，这已经不是冷战的语言而且是冷战的行动了。
