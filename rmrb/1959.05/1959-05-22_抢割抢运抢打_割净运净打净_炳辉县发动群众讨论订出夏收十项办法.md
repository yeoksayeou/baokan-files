Our newspaper Hefei, 21st dispatched: Binghui County, Anhui Province, is widely carrying out propaganda and education on meticulous harvesting and threshing. Relying on the masses, summarizing experience, and formulating ten meticulous harvesting and threshing measures to ensure a bumper harvest.

The county's more than 600,000 mu of wheat is about to ripen. When discussing summer harvest preparations, some cadres and masses did not sufficiently recognize the importance of meticulous harvesting and threshing. They said, "As long as the crops are abundant, losing a little doesn't matter." Others thought that it was impossible to not lose a single grain during harvest. In response to the above ideological situation, all communes and production teams promptly organized the masses to conduct in-depth discussions on the issue of meticulous harvesting and threshing. Many places have adopted the method of carefully calculating accounts to strengthen ideological education, explaining that if each mu can harvest three to five more jin of grain through meticulous harvesting and threshing, the entire team, commune, and county will harvest much more grain. Members of the Yaozhuang Production Team of the Qinren Commune said during the discussion: Every grain has been earned through great effort since last autumn. Not a single grain should be lost. The Liushu Production Team of the ?jian Commune did a relatively rough job of the autumn harvest last year, and later re-threshed a lot of grain. The members learned a lesson from this and are determined to harvest and thresh cleanly this summer. While publicizing and discussing the importance of meticulous harvesting and threshing, various localities have also summarized past experiences and found many good methods for meticulous harvesting and threshing.

The Binghui County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party recently convened a meeting of the first secretaries of the Party committees of various communes to further study the methods discussed in various localities and formulated ten measures for meticulous harvesting and threshing:

First, classify and organize in queues for timely harvesting and threshing. Harvest one area as it ripens, transport one area as it is harvested, and thresh one area as it is transported, to prevent wheat from not being harvested when ripe or not being transported or threshed after being harvested, causing losses such as grain shedding and mold in the fields and threshing grounds. Second, harvest cleanly and transport cleanly. When harvesting wheat, cut it from the roots, leaving no stalks behind; when transporting wheat, tie the bundles tightly so they are not scattered. At the same time, cut and handle gently to avoid threshing during harvesting or transportation. Third, organize children and semi-laborers into specialized teams to pick up wheat. After each field is harvested and transported, rake it once to pick up all the wheat ears. Fourth, improve threshing methods. In the past, wheat bundles were not spread out during threshing, but were randomly spread on the field, which did not thresh the wheat ears mixed in the middle of the bundles; when turning the straw, only turning and not shaking, the wheat stalks easily trapped grains. Due to the busy farm work during the summer harvest and planting, threshing was often done at night in the past, when the wheat ears were damp and not threshed cleanly. This year, in addition to threshing in the sunny midday, measures will be taken to spread the wheat bundles, press them with stone rollers, and shake them vigorously to prevent wheat grains from being trapped in the wheat stalks. Fifth, prepare the threshing ground well. Make the threshing ground large and high, with a smooth surface, to prevent wheat grains from scattering outside the field or falling into cracks in the field that cannot be swept out. Sixth, when the threshing ground becomes damp, first sprinkle and press it with plant ash before threshing to prevent the wheat grains from being pressed into the mud. Seventh, single-sun and single-thresh the wheat heads that have been broken but not threshed, because these wheat heads are not easy to thresh and cannot be threshed cleanly when mixed in the wheat stalks. Eighth, assign special personnel to guard the threshing ground to prevent domestic fowl and livestock from ruining it. Ninth, make preparations for wind, rain, and fire prevention. Establish temporary warehouses at the head of the field, threshing, sun-drying, and warehousing simultaneously to prevent the harvested grain from being lost. Tenth, after all the wheat has been threshed, clean the field, sweep up the wheat husks and broken grass around the field, and re-winnow them to ensure that no grain is lost.

The ten measures for meticulous harvesting and threshing are very popular among the commune members in various places. They are determined to make the first summer harvest after communization better and more meticulous. The county's ten communes have prepared more than 120,000 various harvesting and transportation tools in advance and have prepared more than 1,500 qualified field bases. At the same time, 150,000 laborers have been organized into three teams for seizing the harvest, transportation, and threshing, preparing to carry out the "four clean and four block" competition of harvesting cleanly, transporting cleanly, threshing cleanly, warehousing cleanly, and harvesting by block, transporting by block, threshing by block, and warehousing by block during the summer harvest to ensure that every grain is returned to the granary.

### 抢割抢运抢打　割净运净打净  炳辉县发动群众讨论订出夏收十项办法

    炳辉县发动群众讨论订出夏收十项办法
    本报合肥21日电　安徽省炳辉县广泛地开展细收细打的宣传教育，依靠群众，总结经验，制订出细收细打十项办法，保证做到丰产丰收。
    这个县六十多万亩大、小麦，即将成熟。各地在讨论麦收准备工作的时候，有部分干部、群众对细收细打工作认识不够，他们说：“只要庄稼丰收，丢失一点算不了什么。”还有的人认为收割时一粒不丢、一颗不撒是办不到的事。针对上述思想情况，各公社、生产队都及时组织群众，就细收细打问题，进行深入讨论。很多地方都采取算细账的办法，加强思想教育，说明一亩地如能细收细打多收三、五斤粮食，全队、全社、全县就要多收很多粮食。秦仁公社姚庄生产队社员们在讨论时说：从去年秋天忙到如今，每一颗粮食，都是花了很大的辛苦换来的，一粒也不应该丢掉。?涧公社柳树生产小队去年秋收工作比较粗糙，后来又复打出很多粮食，社员们接受了这个教训，决心今年夏收一定要收净打净。各地在宣传、讨论细收细打的重要意义的同时，又总结过去的经验，找出了不少细收细打的好办法。
    中共炳辉县委最近召开了各公社党委第一书记会议，对各地讨论出来的办法，进一步作了研究，制订了细收细打的十项措施：
    第一，分类排队，及时收打。做到黄一块、割一块，运一块、收一块，以便防止麦子成熟不割或割了不运不打，放在田间、场头遭受风雨造成落粒、霉烂等损失。第二，割净、运净。割麦时要从根部割，不漏一株；运麦时，麦把要扎好，不抛撒。同时，要轻割轻放，以免收割或运输时脱粒。第三，把儿童和半劳动力组织成拾麦专业队，在每块田收割运完以后，用耙子耙一遍，把麦穗拾净。第四，改进打场方法。过去打场，麦把子不撒开，乱铺在场上打麦穗子，而麦把中间夹杂的麦穗子就打不到；翻草时只翻不抖，麦秸容易夹粒子；由于夏收夏种时农活较繁忙，过去往往在夜间打麦，麦穗潮润，打不干净。今年除趁晴天中午打场外，并采取撒开麦把，用石滚子压以及加劲翻抖等办法，不让麦粒夹在麦秸里面。第五，做好场地。打麦场做大做高、场面平坦，防止麦粒撒出场外，或漏入场地裂缝里扫不出来。第六，麦场回潮时，先用草木灰撒上压过，再打麦，以免麦粒子压到泥里去。第七，对已经打断而没有脱粒的麦头子，进行单晒单打，因为这些麦头不容易脱粒，混在麦秸里打不净。第八，确定专人看管麦场，防止家禽家畜糟蹋。第九，做好防风、防雨、防火等准备，场头建立临时仓库，边打边晒边进仓，不让到手的粮食受到损失。第十，麦子全部打完后，清理好场地，把场地四周的麦壳，碎草扫起来，再复扬一次，做到颗粒不丢。
    细收细打的十项办法，很受各地社员群众的欢迎，他们决心要把公社化后的第一个夏收搞得更好更细致。全县十个公社，已提前准备好各种收割工具和运输工具十二万多件，做好符合标准的场基一千五百多个。同时组织好十五万个劳动力，分成抢割抢运抢打三套班子，准备在夏收中开展割净、运净、打净、收净和块收、块运、块打、块进仓的“四净四块”竞赛，做到颗粒归仓。
