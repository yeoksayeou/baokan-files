Xinhua News Agency, 14th: The national spring wheat sowing work has basically been completed. As of May 9th, more than 48.1 million mu of spring wheat had been sown in various regions. Heilongjiang, Gansu, and Jilin provinces have all overfulfilled their sowing plans. In many areas, spring wheat has already emerged from the soil, and the fields are a lush green.

	This year, spring wheat fields in various regions were generally ploughed to a depth of six to seven inches or more, with approximately 10,000 jin of base fertilizer applied per mu and 30 to 40 jin of seeds sown per mu. Many regions sowed only after the land was levelled, sufficient fertilizer was applied, irrigation was saturated, and seeds were treated with pesticides. In the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, the quality of fertilizer in more than half of the spring wheat fields in twelve counties and cities was better than last year. Most of the carefully selected improved varieties were subjected to warm water soaking before sowing. The wheat fields in these counties and cities have full and strong seedlings, with first-class wheat fields having 600,000 seedlings per mu accounting for 66%. In Gansu province, spring wheat fields were ploughed deeper and prepared more carefully than last year, with sufficient moisture and fertilizer, resulting in generally full emergence and vigorous seedling growth. In Jilin province, the spring wheat sowing work in various regions was carried out faster and more carefully than in previous years, and the seedlings are now several inches tall and emerge uniformly. Many counties in the Siping Special District promoted methods of close coordination between ploughing, driving animal teams, and spot sowing to ensure even sowing, uniform soil coverage, and smooth compaction, thereby improving the overall quality of sowing.

	Various regions have shifted to field management work after sowing. Wushan County in Gansu Province and the Ning’an People’s Commune in Zhongning County of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region have established wheat archive management systems, classifying and registering wheat fields by number. The wheat field's yield targets, measures, management personnel, and actual progress are all noted in the register, and management personnel also record the implementation of wheat field management at any time. This can both encourage the planned progress of wheat field sowing and management, facilitate the inspection of the implementation of measures, facilitate the final summary of yield increase experience, and provide reliable data for evaluation and awards.

    全国春小麦播种工作基本结束
    新华社14日讯　全国春小麦播种工作基本结束。截至5月9日，各地已播种春麦四千八百一十余万亩。黑龙江、甘肃、吉林三省都超额完成了播种计划。许多地区的春麦田都已出苗，田间一片嫩绿。
    今年各地春麦田普遍深耕六、七寸以上，一般每亩施基肥一万斤左右，每亩播下种子三十到四十斤。许多地区都在地整平、肥施足、墒灌饱、种拌药以后才播种。宁夏回族自治区十二县市半数以上的春麦田，肥料的质量比去年好，精选的良种播种前大部分进行了温汤浸种，这些县市的麦田苗全苗壮，每亩有六十万苗的一类麦田占66％。甘肃全省春小麦田比去年耕得深，整得细，墒饱肥足，普遍全苗，麦苗生长茁壮。吉林省各地春小麦播种工作比往年进行得又快又仔细，现在苗高数寸，出苗整齐。四平专区许多县推行扶犁、赶套、点种等工序紧密配合的方法，做到种得匀，复土均，镇压平整，播种质量普遍提高。
    各地在播种后就转入田间管理工作。甘肃省武山县和宁夏回族自治区的中宁县宁安人民公社都建立了小麦档案管理制度，把麦田分类、编号注册，麦田的产量指标、措施、管理人员和实际工作的进度等都在册内注明，并随时填写管理人员对麦田管理的执行情况等，既可以督促麦田播种、管理工作有计划地进行，便于检查措施贯彻情况，也便于最后总结增产经验，并且为评比奖励提供可靠的资料。
