Chairman, fellow committee members:

　　I fully agree with and support Premier Zhou Enlai's "Government Work Report," Vice Premier Li Fuchun's and Vice Premier Li Xiannian's reports, as well as Vice Chairman Li Weihan's "Work Report of the Standing Committee of the Second National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference."

　　In Vice Chairman Li Weihan's work report, he specifically mentioned, "After the high tide of the Three Great Transformations, this conference issued the 'Decision on Organizing Democratic Personages and Industrialists and Businessmen from All Circles to Conduct Political Study and Theoretical Study,' and established the Socialist Academy. The provincial, municipal, and autonomous region committees of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, based on this decision, have held political schools and short-term training classes for industrialists and businessmen. In addition, this conference has also held study seminars. These studies have achieved significant results, and most participants have made varying degrees of progress politically and ideologically." In the aspects of work that the People's Political Consultative Conference should strengthen in the future, it is specifically pointed out: "Actively promote and assist democratic personages from all circles in conducting self-remolding according to the six political criteria, strengthen socialist, internationalist, and patriotic education, strengthen education on the general line of socialist construction, and help democratic personages from all circles study Marxism-Leninism theory and Chairman Mao Zedong's works on a voluntary basis."

　　After listening to these two passages of the report, I was filled with infinite memories and excitement, which made me more determined to continue to work hard in study and remolding. Because I am a bourgeois element, and also a bourgeois intellectual, and I have been mixed up in the old society for decades, my mind is filled with bourgeois ideology and consciousness. My views and ideas on new things are always unable to break away from the category of the bourgeoisie.

　　Study

　　Since liberation, I have also constantly participated in study, and the purpose of study is to acquire knowledge of Marxism-Leninism, believing that with knowledge of Marxism-Leninism, I can live in the new society. During the rampant attack on the Party by the bourgeois rightists in 1957, although I did not commit any major mistakes, in terms of certain fallacies of the rightists, my thoughts did have some similarities. Because of this, in the early stage of the anti-rightist struggle, I always remained silent, holding the idea of "each sweeping the snow from his own doorstep, preserving oneself by being worldly-wise." I received education and training in the struggle, and gradually realized that the urgent problem I should solve is a problem of standpoint. Therefore, on a conscious and voluntary basis, I participated in the study at the Socialist Academy.

　　When I first entered the Socialist Academy for study, I was very satisfied that I had found the direction of my efforts, which was to change my standpoint. However, I regarded the standpoint problem as something abstract, and the transformation as not difficult. As long as I studied Marxism-Leninism and resolved to take the socialist road, I could transform from a bourgeois standpoint to a proletarian standpoint, and my standpoint problem would be solved. What remained was only the ideological problem. Fortunately, ideological remolding is a long-term process, so I would slowly remold. This was my thinking at the time.

　　When I was studying each unit in the academy, I always wanted to correctly understand the Party's policies and guidelines, but I always had wrong views and ideas. At first, I thought that my theoretical level was not high enough. After group discussions and listening to reports at the general assembly, I realized that it was still a problem of standpoint. Although I was determined to take the socialist road, having this determination only meant the beginning of accepting remolding, and it did not mean that the standpoint problem could be solved. I always hoped to look at problems from a proletarian standpoint, but this was only a subjective wish, and my bourgeois ideology sometimes unconsciously dominated my views and ideas. Subjective wishes could not solve objective existence, and I realized that it was not easy to transform the bourgeois standpoint. Especially for someone like me, who has deep-rooted bourgeois ideas, it is even more difficult to transform. Through theoretical study, I initially learned the method of class analysis, and I deeply realized that the remolding of the bourgeoisie is indeed arduous, complex, and repetitive. Therefore, I now realize that my self-remolding is even more urgently needed, and I must actively and diligently continue to study. This is the first major gain I had in studying at the academy. Secondly, my attitude towards labor and the working people has changed. I grew up in the city and lived in the city. I have never done manual labor and have always despised labor and belittled the working people. During my studies at the academy, in order to combine theory with practice and implement the policy of combining education with productive labor, I visited the Tianjin depression reform, the people's communes in Xushui and Anguo, and various exhibitions. In particular, my participation in the productive labor of the Sijiqing People's Commune in the suburbs of Beijing was of great educational significance to me, which made me have a new understanding of labor, and I also had a preliminary change in my ideological feelings for the working people.

　　In the past, when I saw working people covered in dirt or sweating profusely on buses or trams, I was unwilling to sit with them, and I felt disgusted in my heart, fearing that the dirty things on their bodies would stain me. Since we also dug soil, pulled weeds, dug peanuts, and picked stones in the fields, not only were our hands covered with mud, but also our bodies were covered with dust. I did not feel that these mud and dust were dirty things, but instead thought that these things were the result of my participation in labor and regarded them as a glorious expression. Since then, when I saw workers covered in oil stains and farmers covered in mud and dust on the bus, I not only did not feel disgusted, but also voluntarily gave up my seat to let them sit together.

　　I was someone who never labored in the old society. In addition, due to my age, I would be out of breath if I labored. Although I never asked for leave for the productive labor of the Sijiqing Commune, my labor was symbolic labor, not serious labor. However, I also initially established a labor perspective, and my ideological feelings for the working people also changed considerably, creating favorable conditions for me to remold my standpoint. For the bourgeoisie, the purpose is to exploit labor, and of course they develop the habit of not laboring. In the initial stage of participating in labor, it is natural to feel unaccustomed and unhappy. But we must persevere in order to change from unaccustomed to accustomed, and from unhappy to happy. When you feel accustomed and happy, that is when your standpoint is changing. Furthermore, you will feel that labor becomes the first need in life.

　　As for the elderly and frail people participating in labor, it is not to keep up with others. I think the main thing is to establish a labor perspective to facilitate remolding. Comrade Nie Zhen, the vice president of the Socialist Academy, said it well: "People who can labor more can labor more, people who can labor less can labor less, and people who cannot labor can also not labor. It is also good to be able to visit labor." This is also my main gain in studying at the Socialist Academy.

　　Visit

　　During my study at the Socialist Academy, in addition to political study and theoretical study, I also had to go out to visit and learn at any time, combining study with practice. After each visit and study, I not only recognized many new things, but also further realized the Party's policies and guidelines. Especially in terms of ideology, great changes took place every time. Therefore, I am very interested in visiting and studying. This time, I participated in the inspection work of the Hubei group, which gave me more opportunities to get a more comprehensive visit and study, which was of great help to my standpoint remolding and ideological remolding.

　　When I was studying the general line of socialism last year, some people doubted whether it would be possible to be fast if we want to be many, and whether it would be possible to be economical if we want to be good in building socialism more, faster, better, and more economically. At that time, my level was not high enough, and I did not have sufficient reasons to explain it. I could only understand that socialism could be built more, faster, better, and more economically. This time, I visited large, medium, and small-sized industries and urban people's communes in Wuhan, and also visited the Yangdang People's Commune in Zaoyang County, a more remote hilly area. All the industries and agriculture we visited were leaping forward in response to the call to build socialism more, faster, better, and more economically. There are too many examples to list. Take Wuhan Heavy Machine Tool Plant as an example. The groundbreaking ceremony was held on April 20, 1956, and the original plan for the construction of the plant was divided into two phases: the first phase of the project was to be completed in 1958, and the second phase of the project was to be completed in 1960. Later, because the workers' minds were liberated, and a soaring enthusiasm was set off, and under the brilliant light of the general line of building socialism more, faster, better, and more economically, the plant construction task was merged into one phase, completed two years ahead of schedule, and officially accepted and put into production on September 26, 1958. However, in 1958, only one quarter of the time was left. The initial plan was to produce 42 machine tools, which was later increased to 65 machine tools. When the plan was revised for the third time, the slogan "Double the production, 130 machine tools" was issued. Finally, it was decided to change the slogan to "Fight hard for 100 days and complete 200 machine tools." At that time, some people in the workers' ranks also thought that the task was too large and difficult to complete. However, under the leadership of advanced elements, by December 29, 217 machine tools were produced, overfulfilling this arduous and great task.

　　To take another practical example, there is a 100-meter chimney in Wugang. According to the speed of one meter per day in capitalist countries, it would take 100 days to build. According to the original plan of Soviet experts, it would also take 45 days. As a result, the 100-meter-high chimney was built in 12 and a half days.

　　We also went to Zaoyang County in Hubei to visit the Yangdang People's Commune, which is 40 kilometers away from the county seat. Zaoyang is a poor county, and Yangdang is a hilly area with high mountains and thin soil. It has 14,777 households, a population of 60,430, including 27,900 laborers, and 240,000 mu of land. In 1957, the average income of farmers was 68.3 yuan per person. After the establishment of the people's commune in 1958, the average income per person was at least 120 yuan and up to 207 yuan. The commune planned to build eight new villages, and one new village has been completed, with 318 houses. Using the spare time of farming, it only took three months. There was no wood, so they used old materials. There were no bricks and tiles, so they built kilns to burn them themselves. There were no carpenters, tilers, or mud workers, so they learned while doing. The grandeur of the new village plan is astonishing. In terms of the width of the road, it exceeds the current Chang'an Street in Beijing. But how much did it cost? It only cost more than 150,000 yuan in total. It made me deeply realize the brilliance of the general line of building socialism more, faster, better, and more economically has illuminated every corner. If I hadn't seen it with my own eyes, I wouldn't have believed that there was such a people's commune in the mountain concave.

　　The original population of Zaoyang County was 470,000, and it has now increased to 620,000. The agricultural population accounts for 550,000, there are 270,000 laborers, and the cultivated area is 2.18 million mu. Among them, the original paddy fields were 180,000 mu. After liberation, water conservancy was built year by year, and it has now increased to 750,000 mu. Last year, the commune was established. On the basis of the great leap forward in the whole county, the people of the whole county spontaneously initiated the construction of the Shahe Dam. After the completion of this dam, it can increase the irrigation area by 500,000 mu. It is an extremely arduous project. There are no engineers and a lack of modern tools, and the difficulty is even more prominent. However, the revolutionary enthusiasm of the working people is soaring. It is expected that this great and glorious task can be completed in April. We personally saw them working hard for their own socialist cause in a happy mood on the construction site. According to the person in charge, the total budget for this dam only needs more than 500,000 yuan, which is fully borne by the commune. At first, I thought I heard it wrong. After asking again, it was indeed only more than 500,000 yuan, and it only costs more than one yuan per mu to increase one mu of irrigated land. It is unimaginable if you don't see it with your own eyes.

　　In general, the all-round great leap forward in 1958 has laid the foundation for my country's socialist construction. In particular, the establishment of the people's commune has opened up the best form of social organization in ancient and modern history. Under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, under the brilliant light of the general line of building socialism more, faster, better, and more economically, the people of the whole country will surely unite closely in the ranks of the working class and strive together for the construction of socialism in the motherland. I absolutely believe that the main indicators of the national economic plan for 1959 can not only be successfully completed, but also more and greater brilliant achievements will appear in front of the people of the world.

　　I am a bourgeois intellectual in the process of transformation. Today, I feel that it is more necessary to step up learning and remolding. On a conscious and voluntary basis, I applied to participate in the second phase of study at the Socialist Academy, and it has now been approved, which makes me very excited. I am determined to study hard and strive to transform into a working-class intellectual as soon as possible.

　　决心走社会主义道路  只能说是改造的开始
    康心之委员的发言主席、各位委员：
    我完全同意和拥护周恩来总理的“政府工作报告”和李富春副总理、李先念副总理的报告以及李维汉副主席“中国人民政治协商会议第二届全国委员会常务委员会工作报告”。
    在李维汉副主席所作的工作报告中特别提到了“在三大改造高潮之后，本会发布了‘关于组织各界民主人士和工商业者进行政治学习和理论学习的决定’举办了社会主义学院。中国人民政治协商会议各省、市、自治区委员会根据这一决定，举办了政治学校和工商业者短期讲习班。此外，本会还举办了学习座谈会。这些学习是有显著成绩的，参加学习的大部分人员在政治上、思想上都有不同程度的进步。”并在今后人民政治协商会议应当加强几方面的工作中又特别指出：“积极推动和协助各界民主人士根据六条政治标准进行自我改造，加强社会主义、国际主义和爱国主义教育，加强社会主义建设总路线的教育，帮助各界民主人士在自愿的基础上学习马克思列宁主义理论，学习毛泽东主席的著作。”
    我听了这两段报告之后，引起了我无限的回忆和兴奋，使我更加坚定继续努力学习改造的信心和决心。因为我是一个资产阶级分子，又是一个资产阶级知识分子，加以在旧社会里混了几十年，脑子里装满了资产阶级的思想意识，对于新事物的看法和想法，总是摆脱不了资产阶级的范畴。
    学习
    解放以后，我也不断参加学习，而学习的目的是为要求懂得马列主义的知识，认为有了马列主义的知识，就可以在新社会里生活下去。一九五七年资产阶级右派向党猖狂进攻的时候，我虽然没有犯过重大的错误；而在右派分子某些谬论方面，在我的思想上说来，确有某些相同之处。因为这样，在反右初期，我总是保持缄默，有“各自打扫门前雪、明哲保身的思想”。在斗争中受到了教育和锻炼，逐步认识到我应该急于解决的问题是一个立场的问题；因此在自觉自愿的基础上，参加了社会主义学院的学习。
    当我进入社会主义学院学习的初期，我很满意地认为已经找到了努力的方向，是为改变我的立场；但是我把立场问题认为是抽象的东西，转变也是不难的事；只要学习了马列主义，下定决心走社会主义的道路，就可以由资产阶级立场转变为无产阶级立场，我的立场问题也就解决了，剩下来的只是思想问题。好在思想改造是长期性的，慢慢地再改造吧，这就是我当时的思想情况。
    当我在学院里学习每个单元的时候，总想正确地去理解党的方针和政策，而随时都有错误的看法和想法；最初还认为是我的理论水平不够，经过小组讨论和听了大会的报告，才知道还是一个立场问题。虽然我是有决心要走社会主义的道路，有了这种决心，只能说是接受改造的开始，不是就能够等于解决了立场问题。我总希望站在无产阶级立场去看问题，这不过是主观的愿望，而我的资产阶级思想在不知不觉之间有时支配了我的看法和想法，主观愿望解决不了客观存在，我才感到资产阶级转变立场不是一件容易的事。尤其像我这样一个有根深蒂固的资产阶级思想的人转变起来更是一件不容易的事。通过理论学习，初步学会了阶级分析的方法，我才深深体会到资产阶级的改造的确是艰巨的、复杂的、而且是反复的。因之我现在已经认识到我的自我改造更有迫切的需要，必须积极努力继续学习，这是我在学院学习中第一个重大的收获。其次，对劳动和劳动人民的态度有了改变。我是生长在城市里的人，又是生活在城市的人；从来没有做过体力劳动的工作，一贯地鄙视劳动，轻视劳动人民。在学院学习中，为理论与实际相结合并贯彻了教育与生产劳动结合的方针，参观了天津的洼地改革，徐水、安国的人民公社，以及各种各样的展览会，尤其是参加了北京郊区四季青人民公社的生产劳动，对于我的教育意义非常重大，使我对于劳动的看法，有了新的认识，对于劳动人民的思想感情，也有了初步的转变。
    过去我在汽车上或电车上看见污秽满身或是满头大汗的劳动人民，我不愿意和他们坐在一起，而且心里有讨厌的感觉，唯恐怕他们身上的脏东西沾染到我的身上。自从我们也在田里挖过土，拔过草，刨过花生，拣过石头，不但两手都是污泥，而且周身尘土，自己并不感到这些污泥和尘土是些脏东西，反而认为这些东西是我参加劳动的成绩，引为光荣的表示。自此以后，我在车上看见油垢漆点满身的工人和污泥尘土满身的农民，不但没有讨厌的感觉，而且自愿匀出座位来让他们坐在一起。
    我在旧社会里是一个从来不劳动的人，加以年龄关系一劳动便要气喘；虽然对于四季青公社的生产劳动，从不请假，而我的劳动是象征性的劳动，不是认真的劳动；但也初步的建立了劳动观点，对于劳动人民的思想感情也起了相当的变化，使我改造立场创造了有利的条件。以资产阶级来说，是以剥削劳动力为目的，当然养成不劳动的习惯；开始参加劳动阶段中，感到不习惯、不愉快，这是很自然的事。但是一定要坚持下去，才能够由不习惯而习惯，不愉快而愉快；感到习惯，感到愉快的时候，也就是立场正在转变了。再进一步还会感到劳动成为生活中的第一需要。
    至于年老体弱的人们参加劳动并不是要与别人看齐；我认为主要是建立劳动观点，便于改造。社会主义学院副院长聂真同志说得好：“能多劳动的人可以多劳动，能少劳动的人可以少劳动，不能劳动的人也可以不劳动，能够参观劳动也有好处。”这也是我在社会主义学院学习中的主要收获。
    参观
    在社会主义学院学习期间，除了政治学习和理论学习外，随时还要出外参观，学习结合实际。当我每次参观学习之后，不但认识了许多新的事物，并且进一步体会到党的政策和方针，尤其对于思想方面，每次都起了很大的变化。因之我对参观学习极感兴趣。这次我参加了湖北组的视察工作，使我有更多的机会，得到更全面的参观学习，对我的立场改造和思想改造都有很大的帮助。
    去年学习社会主义总路线的时候，对于多快好省地建设社会主义的方针，有人怀疑既要多能否快，既要好能否省的问题，当时我的水平不够，没有充分的理由来说明，只能体会到多快好省可以建设社会主义而已。这次在武汉参观了大中小型工业和城市人民公社，又参观了比较边远地方丘陵地带的枣阳县所属杨垱人民公社，凡是我们参观过的工业和农业都是响应多快好省地建设社会主义的号召而大跃进。事例太多不胜枚举。即以武汉重型机床厂来说，一九五六年四月二十日举行开工典礼，建厂工作的原定计划分为两期：一九五八年完成第一期工程，一九六○年完成第二期工程。嗣因工人们的思想解放，掀起了冲天干劲，又在多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线的光辉照耀下，建厂任务两期并为一期，提前两年完成，于一九五八年九月二十六日正式验收马上投入生产。但在一九五八年只剩了一季度的时间，最初计划生产机床四十二台，嗣又增加为六十五台，第三次改订计划时发出口号“生产翻一番，机床一百三”，最后决定改变口号为“苦战一百天，完成二百台”。当时在工人队伍中也有人认为任务太大，恐难完成；但在先进分子带头之下，十二月二十九日为止，生产了机床二百一十七台，超额完成了这个艰巨而伟大的任务。
    再举一个实际的例子来看，武钢有一个百公尺的烟囱，按照资本主义国家一天一公尺的速度，需要百天建成；就按苏联专家的原计划，也需要四十五天，结果是十二天半建成了百公尺高的烟囱。
    我们在湖北又到枣阳县去参观了距县城四十公里的杨垱人民公社。枣阳是一个贫瘠的县份，杨垱又是一个丘陵地区，山高土薄，有一万四千七百七十七户，人口六万零四百三十人，其中劳动力二万七千九百个，土地二十四万亩。一九五七年农民收入每人平均六十八点三元。一九五八年成立人民公社后，每人平均收入最低一百二十元，最高二百零七元。这个公社的规划建立新村八个，已经建成了一个新村，房屋有三百零一十八间，利用农闲的时间，只花了三个月的工夫，没有木料，利用旧料，没有砖瓦，自己造窑烧，没有木瓦泥工，边学边做。新村计划的宏伟，令人吃惊；就以马路的宽度来说，超过北京现在的东西长安街。但是花了多少钱呢？一共只花了十五万多元。使我深深体会到多快好省地建设社会主义总路线的光辉，已经照耀到了每一个角落里。如果不是我亲眼看见，我不会相信山凹里还有一个这样的人民公社出现。
    枣阳县原有人口四十七万，现已增加到六十二万，农业人口占五十五万，劳动力有二十七万个，耕地面积二百一十八万亩。其中水田原有十八万亩，解放后逐年兴修水利，现已增加到七十五万亩。去年公社成立，在全县大跃进的基础上，又由全县人民自动发起修建沙河水坝，这个水坝完成后，可以增加灌溉面积五十万亩，是一个极其艰巨的工程，既无工程师，又缺乏现代化的工具，其困难更为突出，而劳动人民的革命热情，干劲冲天，预定在四月中便可完成这一伟大而光荣的任务。我们在工地上亲眼看见他们正在欢天喜地为他们自己的社会主义事业辛勤工作中。据负责人亲口告诉我们这个水坝的总预算只需要五十几万元，完全由公社负担。最初我还认为我听错了，再问一遍，确是只需五十几万元，增加一亩水地平均只需一元多点。如果不去亲眼看见是不可想像的。
    总的说来一九五八年的全面大跃进已经奠定了我国建设社会主义事业的基础；尤其是人民公社的成立在古今中外历史上开辟了社会组织最好的形式。在党和毛主席领导下，在鼓足干劲、力争上游、多快好省地建设社会主义的总路线的光辉照耀下，全国人民一定会紧密地团结在工人阶级队伍中为祖国建设社会主义而共同奋斗。绝对相信对于一九五九年国民经济计划主要指标，不但可以顺利完成，而且还会有更多更大的辉煌成就出现在全世界人民的面前。
    我是一个正在转变中的资产阶级知识分子，在今天来说，更感到有加紧学习改造的必要；又在自觉自愿的基础上申请参加社会主义学院第二期学习，现在已被批准，使我非常感奋。我决心努力学习争取早日转变成为一个工人阶级知识分子。
