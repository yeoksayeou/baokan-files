Xinhua News Agency, May 26th: Commentary by a reporter from this agency: The campaign for the Japanese House of Councillors election has entered its final, tense stage. The election will be held on June 2nd.

In this House of Councillors election campaign, the issues of revising the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" and Japan-China relations have become the focus of the struggle between the democratic forces in Japan and the Nobusuke Kishi group. This struggle has become an important battle for the Japanese people to oppose the Kishi Nobusuke government's subservience to the United States, its hostility towards China, and its march on the road of militarism. It is foreseeable that the democratic forces in Japan will achieve a new victory in this battle.

In the election campaign, the Liberal Democratic Party, headed by Nobusuke Kishi, has been making deceptive propaganda to the effect that revising the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" would "increase Japan's independence and autonomy." It has also made various false gestures on the issue of Japan-China relations, attempting to win votes in order to increase the Liberal Democratic Party's seats in the House of Councillors from just over half to more than two-thirds (the House of Councillors has 250 seats, and the Liberal Democratic Party currently holds 127 seats). This is in order to pave the way for the signing and ratification of a new "Security Treaty" that would further incorporate Japan into the U.S. atomic strategy system, and then to revise the Japanese Constitution that prohibits war, preparing conditions for Japan's rapid nuclear armament and reliving the old dream of the "Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere."

In sharp contrast to the Kishi Nobusuke group's conspiracy, the progressive forces, consisting of the Japan Socialist Party and the Communist Party, have raised the banner of shattering the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," striving to restore Japan-China diplomatic relations, and realizing Japan's neutralization in the election campaign, and have received enthusiastic support from the broad masses of the Japanese people. The Socialist Party stated in its election policy that it wants to "advance from its current state of occupying one-third of the seats in the House of Councillors (78 seats) to become the largest party, so as to further suppress the unreasonable behavior of the Liberal Democratic Party in the House of Representatives, which relies on a majority of seats, while maintaining the peace constitution, and to prevent the revision of the U.S.-Japan Security Treaty."

In order to concentrate efforts to enable the democratic forces to win the election, the Japan Socialist Party and the Communist Party have already put forward joint candidates in Yamanashi, Akita, Ishikawa, Kochi, Ehime, Kagawa and other prefectures.

It can be foreseen from the fact that the Japanese democratic forces have already achieved great victories in the local elections held in April as a prelude to the House of Councillors election, that the Socialist Party and the Communist Party are likely to achieve greater victories in the House of Councillors election.

In the local elections, the number of seats won by progressive parties for prefectural governors, prefectural assembly members, mayors and city councilors, as well as the number of votes obtained in the elections, have increased significantly compared with the previous elections. Even in the four gubernatorial elections in Tokyo, Osaka, Fukuoka, and Hokkaido, where the Liberal Democratic Party has vigorously boasted that it had won "victory," progressive parties have made unprecedented progress.

Despite facing extremely difficult circumstances of being subjected to fascist persecution in the local elections, the Japanese Communist Party has made great progress under the love and enthusiastic support of the voters. Especially in the seven prefectures of Iwate, Akita, Nagano, Mie, Oita, Miyazaki, and Kagoshima, where the Communist Party had to put forward its own candidates alone, the votes obtained by its candidates increased by an average of 4.6 times compared with the 1955 local elections, and even increased by 10 times in some prefectures.

Through this local election, the reactionary nature of the Kishi Nobusuke government has been further exposed, and the Kishi Nobusuke group, which is implementing a policy of subservience to the United States, has become more isolated. On the other hand, with the unfolding of the House of Councillors election campaign, the anti-American struggle of the Japanese masses has also become more intense. In both the election campaign and the movement against the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," there has been a situation in which the Socialist Party and the Communist Party have established joint struggle organizations. This situation is more favorable to the Socialist Party and the Communist Party than the previous House of Representatives election and the recent local elections. This favorable situation will be reflected in the results of the House of Councillors election.

Japanese public opinion pointed out that the results of the House of Councillors election may put the Kishi Nobusuke Cabinet in a more serious crisis. Because, from the current campaign situation, the Socialist Party and the Communist Party will undoubtedly make progress, thereby forming a strong force in the House of Councillors against the Kishi Nobusuke group's revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty"; on the other hand, the seats occupied by the entire conservative forces centered on the Liberal Democratic Party in the House of Councillors will be reduced; within the Liberal Democratic Party, the seats of the "anti-mainstream faction" that holds different views from the Kishi Nobusuke group on the revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" and Japan-China relations may increase, and the factional contradictions within the ruling party will be further deepened. All of this will make the Kishi Nobusuke group face more serious difficulties in the reorganization of the cabinet and the revision of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" after the House of Councillors election. If Kishi Nobusuke disregards the opposition of the people and attempts to forcibly pass a new U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty" at the extraordinary session of the Diet to be held in the autumn, then, under the strong opposition of the progressive parties, it may face a more chaotic and difficult political situation than when it attempted to forcibly pass the reactionary "Police Officer Duties Execution Law" amendment in the Diet last winter.

### 日本参议院选举日益临近  民主力量准备沉重打击反动势力

    日本参议院选举日益临近
    民主力量准备沉重打击反动势力
    新华社26日讯  本社记者述评：日本参议员选举的竞选运动已经进入最后的紧张阶段，这次选举将在6月2日举行投票。
    在这次参议员选举的竞选运动中，修改日美“安全条约”和日中关系问题形成了日本民主力量和岸信介集团之间的斗争的焦点。这次斗争已经成为日本人民反对岸信介政府屈从美国、敌视中国和走军国主义道路的一次重要战役。可以预见，日本民主力量将在这一战役中取得新的胜利。
    在竞选运动中，以岸信介为首的自由民主党极力进行了所谓修改日美“安全条约”将可以“增加日本的独立自主性”的欺骗性宣传，并且在日中关系问题上作了各种各样的虚假姿态，企图借以骗取选票，从而使自由民主党通过这次选举把它在参议院中所占的议席从刚刚超过半数增加到三分之二以上（参议院有二百五十个席位，自由民主党目前占一百二十七席），以便为签订和批准进一步把日本纳于美国原子战略体系的新约“安全条约”，进而修改禁止战争的日本宪法铺平道路，为日本的迅速进行核武装和重温“大东亚共荣圈”旧梦准备条件。
    同岸信介集团的阴谋针锋相对，由日本社会党和共产党构成的进步力量在竞选运动中，高举粉碎日美“安全条约”、争取恢复日中邦交和实现日本中立化的旗帜，受到了日本广大人民的热烈支持。社会党在它的竞选政策中提出，要“从目前占参议院中三分之一议席（七十八席）的状态迈进，成为第一大党，以便在维护和平宪法的同时，进一步压制自由民主党在众议院依靠过半数席位所采取的蛮横无理行为，阻止改订日美安全条约。”
    为了集中力量使民主力量在选举中获得胜利，日本社会党和共产党已经在山梨、秋田、石川、高知、爱媛、香川等县提出联合候选人。
    从日本民主力量在4月里举行的作为参议员选举前哨战的地方选举中已经获得很大胜利这一情况中可以预见，社会党和共产党在参议员选举中有可能取得更大的胜利。
    在地方选举中，进步党派取得的县知事、县议员、市长和市议员的席位以及在选举中获得的票数都比上次选举中有了显著增加。就是在自由民主党极力吹嘘它曾经获得“胜利”的东京、大阪、福冈、北海道四大知事选举中，进步党派还是取得了空前的进展。
    日本共产党尽管在地方选举中面临着受到法西斯迫害的极其困难的局面，但是在选民的爱戴和热烈支持下仍然取得了很大的进展。尤其是在岩手、秋田、长野、三重、大兮、宫崎、鹿儿岛等七个县里，共产党在不得不单独提出它自己的候选人的情况下，它的候选人所获得的选票平均比1955年地方选举时增加了四点六倍，在有的县中甚至增加了十倍。
    经过这次地方选举，岸信介政府的反动本质进一步暴露，执行屈从美国政策的岸信介集团已经变得更加孤立。另一方面，随着参议员竞选运动的展开，日本群众的反美斗争也更加高涨，在竞选运动和反对日美“安全条约”的运动中，都出现了社会党和共产党建立联合斗争组织的局面，这种形势，对社会党和共产党来说，比去年众议员选举和不久前的地方选举时都更加有利，这种有利形势将反映在参议员选举的结果上。
    日本舆论指出，参议员选举的结果可能使岸信介内阁面临更严重的危机。因为，从目前竞选的形势看来，社会党和共产党毫无疑问将要获得进展，从而在参议院中构成反对岸信介集团修改日美“安全条约”的雄厚力量；另一方面，以自由民主党为中心的整个保守势力在参议院占据的席位将会减少；在自由民主党内部，在修改日美“安全条约”和日中关系问题上同岸信介集团持有不同意见的“反主流派”的议席可能增加，执政党内的派系矛盾将会进一步加深。所有这一切，都将使岸信介集团在参议员选举后的改组内阁和修改日美“安全条约”问题上，面临更加严重的困难。如果岸信介不顾人民反对，企图在秋季举行的国会临时会议上强行通过新的日美“安全条约”，那么，在进步党派的强有力的反对下，它有可能面临比去年冬季它在国会上企图强行通过反动的“警察官职务执行法”修正案时更加混乱和困难的政治局面。（附图片）
