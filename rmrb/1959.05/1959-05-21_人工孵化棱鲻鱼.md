Scientific Brief

    Artificial Incubation of Grey Mullet

    More than 10,000 young grey mullet are swimming in Xinglin Bay, Xiamen City, Fujian Province. This is the result of artificial spawning and incubation experiments conducted recently in Xinglin Bay on the locally abundant grey mullet by the Institute of Oceanology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Fujian Provincial Fisheries Experimental Institute, and the Biology Department of Xiamen University, with the assistance and support of the Fujian Provincial Aquatic Products Bureau, the Xiamen City Aquatic Products Bureau, and aquatic farms.

    The mullet, pronounced "zi," is produced in coastal waters. The grey mullet is a type of mullet, smaller in size, with delicious meat and high nutritional value. Xinglin Bay, where this grey mullet is abundant, is a quite ideal fish farming location. According to the aquatic production policy of "emphasizing aquaculture," such bays should be well developed and utilized. Previously, most fish fry here relied on natural capture, but the annual yield of natural fry is unstable, and the mortality rate during capture and transportation is high. To solve the problem of supplying fish fry for bay aquaculture, artificial incubation must be adopted in addition to banning fishing during the spawning season to allow natural spawning. Scientific researchers from the Institute of Oceanology and collaborating units began artificial incubation of grey mullet here in early March this year, resulting in the hatching of this batch of fry, which are now being further cultivated.

    人工孵化棱鲻鱼
    一万多尾幼小的棱鲻鱼正在福建省厦门市杏林湾游来游去。这是中国科学院海洋研究所和福建省水产实验所、厦门大学生物系在福建省水产局、厦门市水产局以及水产养殖场的协助支持下，最近在杏林湾对当地盛产的棱鲻进行人工催卵孵化试验获得的成果。
    鲻，音“资”，产于近海。棱鲻是鲻鱼的一种，体形较小，肉味鲜美，营养价值很高。盛产这种棱鲻的杏林湾，是一个相当理想的养鱼场所。根据“以养为主”的水产方针，对这样的港湾应该很好地加以开发和利用。以往这里的鱼苗大多靠自然捕捞，但是每年天然鱼苗的产量不稳定，而且在捕捞和运输过程中死亡率很高。解决港养鱼苗的供应问题，除禁渔期使其天然产卵外，必须采用人工孵育。海洋研究所同协作单位的科学研究人员，从今年3月初在这里着手进行棱鲻的人工孵育，结果孵出了这一批仔鱼，现在正在进一步培养。
