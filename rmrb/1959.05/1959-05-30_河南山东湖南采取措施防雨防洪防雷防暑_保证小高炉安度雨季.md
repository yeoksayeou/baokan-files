Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, May 29th: The steel front in Henan Province is vigorously storing ore and coke to ensure the normal production of small blast furnaces during the rainy and summer seasons. Since the beginning of May, while focusing on quality and high output, steel plants in various regions have concentrated their transportation forces on a crash program to transport ore and coke. The transportation force organized by Jiaozuo City, consisting of more than 480 horse-drawn carts and 80 trucks, has been working on a crash transportation program for more than ten days, and the ore and coke reserves within the plants have greatly increased compared to the past. At present, key steel plants in Xinxiang, Jiaozuo, Anyang, Zhengzhou, Luoyang, Kaifeng, and other locations have ore reserves sufficient for half a month to a month. Many factories and mines have also gathered large quantities of ore from the mines and transported them to railway lines and major road transport routes that remain unobstructed during the rainy season. To prevent wet materials from entering the furnace, many steel plants have also built rain shelters for the stored furnace materials.

Steel plants in various regions attach great importance to the production safety and living conditions of workers during the summer and rainy seasons. Xinxiang, Jiaozuo, Anyang, and other steel plants recently launched a comprehensive safety inspection by mobilizing the masses of workers, and in conjunction with the inspection, formulated and improved production safety systems, and increased necessary safety production facilities.

Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, May 29th: The Shandong Provincial Metallurgical Industry Bureau recently held a telephone conference, requesting that the metallurgical bureaus of various special districts (cities) and related factories and mines, based on the local historical rainfall, hydrology, and terrain conditions, quickly prepare for rain prevention work to ensure that small blast furnaces safely pass the rainy season. According to the deployment of the Provincial Metallurgical Bureau, various regions have quickly taken action. The Yishan Steel Plant in Yixian County used galvanized iron to construct the top of the blast furnace, and stepped up the construction of a rain shelter for the charging operation. To prevent rainwater from soaking the blast furnace, they also built earthen platforms around the furnace. The Yantai First and Second Iron Smelting Plants have built material sheds of more than 10,000 square meters. Twenty-seven of the forty-five hot blast stove chimneys at the Yantai Steel Plant have been fitted with lightning rods. To ensure the transportation of materials during the rainy season, various parts of the Yantai Special District are organizing highway maintenance networks, mainly through people's communes. This special district is also promoting the experience of "recycled kang heating," using recycled hot blast stove gas to dry materials, ensuring that the blast furnace can consume dry materials during the rainy season.

Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, May 29th: Hunan Province has taken measures to do a good job in preventing rain, floods, lightning, heatstroke, and in summer and rainy season worker labor protection, to ensure the smooth production of small blast furnaces.

In the second half of last year, when Hunan Province was building small blast furnaces, it paid attention to preventing rain, floods, and lightning. Blast furnaces were generally built above the flood water level, the top of the furnaces were equipped with rain shelters, and rain corridors, drainage ditches, and sewers were built in each workshop and factory building. Before the arrival of the rainy season, various places conducted a comprehensive inspection of the small blast furnaces and mines, reinforced and repaired cracked and leaking small blast furnace rain shelters and mine roof shelters. Various factories and mines also extracted a large number of laborers to build simple raw material sheds to ensure that the raw materials were not rained on, and added repairs to all roads, large and small, in the factory area to ensure that transportation in the factory area was unimpeded during the rainy season.

All factories and mines in the province engaged in steel and iron production have formulated specific measures for heatstroke prevention and cooling. The Hunan Provincial Metallurgical Bureau organized the Hengyang Metallurgical Machinery Repair and Manufacturing Plant to produce 318 axial flow fans (spray cooling) for various factories and mines in the province. In order to ensure the safety and health of workers operating under high temperatures, each factory and mine has prepared ice-making machines and mung beans, made cooling drinks, and improved natural ventilation inside the factory buildings.

Because various places had made early preparations for rain, flood, and lightning protection for small blast furnaces, the production of small blast furnaces is still proceeding normally under the recent continuous rainy weather. The Hunan Provincial Metallurgical Bureau recently requested that various factories and mines further improve their preparations for heatstroke prevention and cooling to ensure safe production during the hot season.

    河南山东湖南采取措施防雨防洪防雷防暑
    保证小高炉安度雨季
    新华社郑州29日电　河南省钢铁战线大力储备矿石、焦炭，保证小高炉在雨季、夏季正常进行生产。进入5月份以来，各地钢铁厂在抓优质、高产的同时，都集中运输力量，突击运输矿石、焦炭。焦作市组织的四百八十多辆马车和八十辆汽车的运输大军，已经突击运输了十多天，厂内的矿石，焦炭储备量都比过去大大增加。目前，新乡、焦作、安阳、郑州、洛阳、开封等重点钢铁厂的矿石，都有半月到一个月的储备。有不少的厂矿，还把大量矿石从矿山上集运到雨季运行无阻的铁路旁和公路交通干线。为了不使湿料入炉，许多钢铁厂还为储备的炉料搭盖了防雨棚。
    各地钢铁厂都很重视夏季、雨季职工的生产安全和生活问题。新乡、焦作、安阳等钢铁厂，最近发动职工群众进行了全面安全大检查，结合检查，制定和健全了生产安全制度，增加了必要的安全生产设施。
    新华社济南29日电　山东省冶金工业局最近召开电话会议，要求各专区（市）冶金局和有关厂、矿，根据当地历年雨量、水文及地势情况，迅速作好防雨工作，保证小高炉过好雨季关。各地根据省冶金局的布置，已经迅速行动起来。峄县峄山钢铁厂用白铁皮建造高炉顶，并加紧建造上料操作的防雨棚，为防止雨水浸湿高炉，还在炉子周围筑起土台子。烟台第一、第二炼铁厂，已经建起料棚一万多平方公尺。烟台钢铁厂的四十五座热风炉烟囱，已有二十七座安装了避雷针。为了确保雨季物资运输，烟台专区各地正以人民公社为主组织公路保养网。这个专区还在推行“回笼火炕”的经验，利用回收热风炉煤气来烘料，保证高炉在雨季能吃干料。
    新华社长沙29日电　湖南省采取措施做好防雨、防洪、防雷、防暑和夏季、雨季工人劳动保护工作，保证小高炉顺利生产。
    去年下半年，湖南省在建设小高炉的时候，就注意了防雨、防洪和防雷。高炉普遍建立在洪水水位以上，炉顶都设有遮雨篷，各车间和厂房修了防雨走廊和排水沟、下水道。在雨季来临前，各地对小高炉和矿山，又进行了全面检查，加固和修补了裂缝漏水的小高炉遮雨篷、矿山顶篷。各厂矿还抽出大批劳力修建了简易原料棚，保证原料不被雨淋，加修了厂区所有大小路道，保证厂区运输在雨季畅通无阻。
    全省从事钢、铁生产的各厂矿对于防暑降温工作都制订了具体措施。湖南省冶金局组织衡阳冶金机械修造厂，为全省各厂矿生产了三百一十八台轴流扇风机（喷雾降温）。各厂矿为了保证工人在高温下操作的安全和身体健康，分别准备了制冰机和绿豆，制作清凉饮料，并且改善了厂房内的自然通风。
    由于各地对小高炉防雨、防洪、防雷的准备工作做得早，在最近连续阴雨的情况下，小高炉的生产还是正常进行。湖南省冶金局最近要求各厂矿进一步做好防暑降温的准备工作，保证在暑季安全生产。
