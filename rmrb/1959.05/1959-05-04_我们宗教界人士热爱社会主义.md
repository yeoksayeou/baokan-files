Comrade Chairman, Presidium, all committee members and representatives:

I consider it the happiest and most glorious event in my life to be able to participate in the first session of the Third National Committee of the CPPCC and to attend the first session of the Second National People's Congress as a non-voting delegate.

I fully agree with and support Premier Zhou Enlai's report on the work of the government, Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the draft national economic plan, Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the final state accounts and draft budget, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen's report on the work of the Standing Committee of the NPC, and Vice Chairman Li Weihan's report on the work of the Standing Committee of the Second National Committee of the CPPCC.

This meeting was convened under the glorious illumination of the general line of "going all out, aiming high, and building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results" put forward by the Chinese Communist Party and the great leader Chairman Mao, and after the great victory of the socialist revolution on the ideological and political fronts, with the 600 million people of the country actively striving for socialist construction with soaring enthusiasm, bold creativity, and a daring spirit. Therefore, it is of great historical significance.

I firmly believe that these two meetings will greatly promote the implementation of the resolution of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the CPC and the fulfillment and overfulfillment of the four major targets put forward for the development of the national economy in 1959, namely 18 million tons of steel, 380 million tons of coal, 1,050 billion catties of grain, and 100 million dan of cotton.

Our socialist construction on all fronts, along the broad road opened up by the Great Leap Forward last year, will achieve greater leaps and greater achievements.

The content of my speech is mainly divided into the following two points:

(1) The tremendous changes that have taken place in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region among religious figures after carrying out socialist education and a rectification movement centered on the struggle against local nationalism.

(2) After enhancing their socialist ideological understanding, religious figures feel that their future is bright.

1.  Last year, people of all ethnic groups and all walks of life in the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region launched a rectification movement and socialist education movement, especially the political consultative conference and the Islamic Association of the autonomous region, which lasted six and a half months, carried out a rectification movement centered on opposing local nationalism and achieved great victory. Tremendous changes have also taken place among religious figures in the autonomous region. First of all, we religious figures have more firmly established our confidence in safeguarding the leadership of the Party, the unity of the motherland, the unity of nationalities, and taking the socialist road. We have changed our parasitic thinking of the past that "labor is not glorious," actively participated in socialist construction labor and work, transformed our thinking, and began to gradually move towards a bright future. I will briefly introduce some of the situations in which religious figures in Kuqa County have been involved in the overall leap forward from the second half of 1958 to the present. Under the continuous and victorious influence of the revolutionary movement on the political and ideological front in the Party's rectification and socialist education process, people from all walks of life in the county have set off a climax of self-transformation. We religious figures, like other people from all walks of life, have also actively carried out the self-transformation movement. The vast majority of religious figures have actively participated in political study under the leadership of the Party, improved their ideological understanding, and the political awareness of religious figures has generally been further improved, actively doing things that are beneficial to socialist construction. Under the leadership of the Party and on the basis of continuous improvement of their political awareness, they have also actively participated in the Party's various propaganda work. In the half year of 1958, our 1,190 religious figures widely publicized the Party's general line of socialist construction, with a total audience of 528,333 person-times, making some small contributions to socialist education work.

2.  We religious figures have also deeply realized that to transform our thinking well and change our political stance, in addition to actively carrying out study and strengthening self-transformation, we should also actively participate in various physical labors that are conducive to socialist construction and suitable for our physical conditions, exercise ourselves in labor, improve ourselves, and accumulate wealth for socialist construction. There are a total of 1,197 religious figures in our county, of which 229 have planted 217.8 mu of experimental fields of wheat, corn, cotton, etc. I and 15 other religious figures planted experimental fields on 7 mu of corn land in the Shaksha Cooperative, with an average yield of 800 jin per mu. In terms of manure accumulation, religious figures in our county accumulated 7,174,259 jin of livestock manure, 397,133 jin of human manure, and 1,788,026 jin of other fertilizers, for a total of 9,359,418 jin of fertilizer in the second half of 1958.
Currently, 999 religious figures in our county actually participate in labor, earning 58,160 workdays and 297,798 work points, with an average of 58 and a half days of labor per person, earning 298 work points. The highest was 1,225 work points and the lowest was 30 work points. During the summer harvest of 1958, 27 religious figures living in the city also participated in the work of harvesting and overcoming disasters, helping the cooperative with 378 workdays. Eighty-eight young people helped with flood control and waterlogging work and got 119 workdays. In addition, we religious figures also participated in the industrial construction work of steelmaking and ironmaking.

3.  Religious figures in our county have universally participated in the movement to eliminate the four pests and the conservation movement. Only 238 religious figures in two districts have eliminated 19,484 sparrows, 5,795 rats, 120 kilograms of flies, 921 crows, and more than 12,000 other harmful birds. We responded to Chairman Mao's call for diligence and thrift in managing households and practicing economy. We celebrated the two festivals based on the principle of saving money and widely publicized to the masses. Only 63 religious figures in the city saved a total of 1,134 yuan.

4.  We religious figures have changed the old feudal and backward views of discriminating against women and disrespecting women's human rights. In the past, many religious figures not only did not allow their women to go out to work, but also adopted discriminatory or even打击 attitudes towards working women, saying that "crops will suffer and there will be droughts" if women work with men. Now, this has begun to fundamentally change. In addition to allowing and encouraging their women to work, religious figures have also publicized and explained to the masses that they no longer discriminate against women or look down on women. Communization has played a role in promoting the liberation of women's labor force. Now men and women are working together with enthusiasm and joy, no longer restricted by religious circles. They are now working under the leadership of the commune with soaring enthusiasm and will achieve greater success in socialist construction.

5.  Through the leadership of the Party, the help of the people, and our efforts, our awareness has been improved, and we are basically able to distinguish between right and wrong and draw a clear line between the enemy and ourselves. We have a clearer understanding of all the feudal privileges and systems that are unfavorable to socialist construction and affect production. Religious figures in our autonomous region unanimously and warmly oppose acts that undermine the unity of the motherland and the unity of nationalities. We resolutely oppose all words and deeds that are unfavorable to socialism. We firmly oppose feudal exploitation of the people. We actively support and actively promote children and young people to learn culture and science to become useful talents for the country; we firmly implement the Marriage Law of the People's Republic of China and do not interfere with the freedom of marriage of the masses. Correctly implement the Party's policy of freedom of religious belief and do not force anyone to believe in religion. In this regard, we religious figures are currently doing what we should do and what is beneficial to socialism.

(II) In the past, the understanding of religious figures in our autonomous region on many issues was vague, and some mistakes were also serious. A few people, under the guise of religion, carried out activities against the Party, against socialism, against the unity of the motherland and the unity of nationalities, especially against the help of the Han elder brother to the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang. Under the leadership of the Party, we have ruthlessly exposed and struggled against these reactionary elements who engage in reactionary activities under the guise of religion and under the pretext of religious activities. The six-and-a-half-month rectification meeting of the Autonomous Region Political Consultative Conference and the Islamic Association, attended by nearly 400 people, has greatly educated us. The materials at this meeting fully proved that local nationalist elements, under the banner of religion, have long engaged in organized and planned anti-Party and anti-socialist activities, attempting to overthrow the leadership of the Party and the people's regime, and attempting to betray Xinjiang to imperialism, causing the people to fall into the abyss of poverty and suffering again. These living facts have educated us and improved us, making it clearer to us that the road we must take must be the socialist road. In a socialist country, we religious figures recognize that our future is bright. We can live in today's socialist society, and the people of the whole country and the people of Xinjiang are creating wealth and building the motherland with soaring enthusiasm, which is also a great encouragement to us. The lives of the people of the whole country and the people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang will become increasingly happy, and the future of us religious figures will be as bright and happy as that of the people of the whole country.

We deeply feel that the Party's proposal to carry out rectification, socialist education, and the struggle against local nationalism in minority areas is very correct. After this rectification and struggle, the socialist construction of our Xinjiang will achieve greater achievements like all parts of the country. We religious figures, like other people from all walks of life in the country, will continuously transform our thinking, improve our awareness, and work together with the people of all ethnic groups and all walks of life to actively strive for a happy socialist and communist society.

Finally, I fully agree with the State Council's order on quickly quelling the rebellion of the Tibetan rebel group. At the same time, I also hope that the monks and lay people in Tibet will do their best for the unity of the motherland and the unity of nationalities, actively support the People's Liberation Army to thoroughly quell the rebellion, so that the Tibet Autonomous Region can be established as soon as possible, and the Tibetan people can quickly get rid of the feudal serf system and quickly embark on a happy socialist life. I firmly oppose the shameless act of Indian expansionists interfering in our country's internal affairs. Anyone who wants to divide the unity of our motherland and the unity of all ethnic groups will be met with shameful failure.

Let me finally shout:

Long live the great unity of the people of all ethnic groups in the country!
Long live the Chinese Communist Party!
Long live Chairman Mao, the great leader of the people of all ethnic groups!

专栏：

    我们宗教界人士热爱社会主义
    阿木提大毛拉委员的发言敬爱的主席、主席团、全体委员和代表同志们：
    此次我能够参加第三届政协全国委员会第一次全体会议并能够列席第二届全国人民代表大会第一次会议，我认为是有生以来最愉快和最光荣的一件大事。
    我完全同意和拥护周恩来总理关于政府工作的报告，李富春副总理关于国民经济计划草案的报告，李先念副总理关于国家决算和预算草案的报告，彭真副委员长关于人大常委会的工作报告和李维汉副主席关于政协第二届全国委员会常务委员会的工作报告。
    这次会议是在中国共产党和伟大的领袖毛主席提出的“鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义”总路线的光辉照耀下，全国六亿人民在各个工作岗位上以冲天干劲，大胆创造，敢想敢做的精神为社会主义建设而积极奋斗，尤其是在思想战线上、政治战线上取得社会主义革命伟大胜利后召开的，因此，它是具有重大的历史意义的。
    我深信这两个会议对贯彻中共中央八届六中全会决议，为完成和超额完成一九五九年发展国民经济所提出的钢产量一千八百万吨，煤三亿八千万吨，粮食一万零五百亿斤，棉花一亿担等四大指标将起着很大的推动作用。
    我们各个战线上的社会主义建设，沿着去年大跃进开辟的广宽大道，将要取得更大的跃进和更大的成就。
    我发言的内容主要分为以下两点：
      （一）新疆维吾尔自治区在宗教界人士中进行社会主义教育，和以反对地方民族主义斗争为中心的整风运动以后所起的巨大变化。
    （二）我们宗教界人士提高社会主义思想认识后，感到自己前途是光明的。
    1、新疆维吾尔自治区各族、各界人士去年开展了整风和社会主义教育运动，特别是为期六个半月的自治区政治协商会议和伊斯兰教协会会议进行了以反对地方民族主义为中心的整风运动，取得了很大胜利以后，在自治区的宗教界人士中也产生了巨大的变化。我们宗教界人士首先更加坚定了维护党的领导，祖国的统一，民族的团结和走社会主义道路的信心，改变了过去认为“劳动不光荣”的寄生思想，积极参加社会主义建设的劳动和工作，改造自己思想，开始逐步的向着光明的前途迈进。仅将我们库车县宗教界人士一九五八年下半年起至现在止结合全面跃进中所表现的一些情况简单介绍如下。本县各界人士，在党的整风和社会主义教育过程中，在政治和思想战线上的革命运动继续不断地深入和胜利影响下，掀起了各界人士自我改造的高潮。我们宗教界人士和其他各界人士一样也积极开展了自我改造运动。绝大多数宗教界人士在党的领导下积极参加了政治学习，提高自己的思想认识，宗教界人士的政治觉悟普遍地得到了进一步的提高，积极地做着对社会主义建设有益的事情。在党的领导下和自己政治觉悟不断提高的基础上，也积极参加了党的各种宣传工作。一九五八年的半年中，我们一千一百九十位宗教界人士广泛地宣传了党的社会主义建设总路线，听众达到五十二万八千三百三十三名次。对社会主义教育工作作出了一些小小的贡献。2、我们宗教界人士也深深的体会到，要很好地改造思想，转变政治立场，除积极进行学习，加强自我改造外，还应该积极参加各种有利于社会主义建设的适合自己身体条件的体力劳动，在劳动中锻炼自己，提高自己，为社会主义建设积累财富。我县宗教界人士共有一千一百九十七名，其中二百二十九名种了麦子、玉米、棉花等二百一十七点八亩的试验田。我和其他十五位宗教界人士在沙克沙合作社七亩玉米地上种了试验田，每亩平均获得八百斤的丰产。在积肥方面，我们全县宗教界人士积牲畜粪七百一十七万四千二百五十九斤。积人粪三十九万七千一百三十三斤，积其他肥料一百七十八万八千零二十六斤，一九五八年下半年共积肥九百三十五万九千四百一十八斤。
  目前我县宗教界人士实际参加劳动者九百
  九十九位，得五万八千一百六十个劳动日，获得二十九万七千七百九十八个工分，平均每人参加五十八天半劳动，得二百九十八个工分，最高的得到一千二百二十五个工分，最低得三十个工分。一九五八年夏收时期，居住在城市的宗教界人士还有二十七位参加了收割和战胜灾害的工作，帮助合作社三百七十八个工，八十八名青年帮助了防汛水患工作并得了一百一十九个工。另外，我们宗教界人士还参加炼钢炼铁的工业建设工作。
    3、我县宗教界人士普遍地参加了除四害运动和节约运动。仅两个区的宗教界人士二百三十八人就消灭麻雀一万九千四百八十四只，老鼠五千七百九十五只，苍蝇一百二十公斤，乌鸦九百二十一个，其他害鸟一万二千多个。我们响应了毛主席勤俭持家厉行节约的号召。在两个节日时本着节约原则过节，并向广大群众广泛进行宣传，仅城市六十三位宗教界人士共节约一千一百三十四元。
    4、我们宗教界人士改变了旧封建的歧视妇女、不尊重妇女人权的落后观点。过去许多宗教界人士不但不允许自己的女人出外劳动，而且看见劳动的妇女采取歧视甚至打击的态度，妇女与男人同劳动，便说什么“庄稼要受灾了，要闹旱灾了”。现在开始从根本上改变了，宗教界人士除允许和鼓励自己的女人劳动外，并向广大群众宣传解释，再不歧视妇女，看不起妇女了。公社化后对解放妇女劳动力起了促进的作用。现在男女一起劳动，热情愉快，不再受宗教界的束缚了。现正以干劲冲天的精神在公社领导下劳动着，将要在社会主义建设中取得更大成绩。
    5、经过党的领导，人民群众的帮助和我们的努力，我们觉悟提高了，基本上能够辨别大是大非划清敌我界限了，我们对不利于社会主义建设和影响生产的一切封建的特权和制度有了更加清楚的认识。我们自治区的宗教界人士一致的热烈地反对破坏祖国统一和民族团结的行为。一切不利于社会主义言行，我们都给予坚决的反对。我们坚决反对对人民群众进行封建剥削。我们积极地赞成并积极宣传儿童青年学文化、学科学成为国家有用的人材；坚决贯彻执行中华人民共和国婚姻法，不干涉群众婚姻的自由。正确执行党的宗教信仰自由政策，不强迫任何人信教。在这方面，目前我们宗教界人士正在做着我们应该做的，有利于社会主义的事情。
    （二）我们自治区的宗教界人士中过去在许多问题上认识是模糊的，有些错误也是严重的。有少数人披着宗教外衣进行着反对党、反对社会主义、反对祖国统一和民族团结的活动，特别是反对汉族老大哥对新疆各族人民的帮助。这些披着宗教外衣、假借宗教活动进行反动勾当的反动分子，我们在党的领导下给予了无情的揭露和斗争。自治区政协和伊斯兰教协会为期六个半月将近四百余人参加的整风会议，对我们教育很大。这次会议上材料充分证明了打着宗教旗帜的地方民族主义分子，长期以来进行有组织有计划地反党、反社会主义活动，企图推翻党的领导和人民政权，企图把新疆断送给帝国主义，使人民重陷于穷困苦难的深渊。这些活的事实，教育了我们，提高了我们，使我们更加明确，我们要走的道路必须是社会主义道路，在社会主义国家里，我们宗教界人士认识自己前途是光明的，我们能生活在今天的社会主义社会里，全国人民新疆人民都在用冲天干劲创造财富建设祖国，对我们也是很大的鼓舞。全国人民和新疆各族人民的生活将日益幸福起来，我们宗教界人士的前途也和全国人民一样是光明的幸福的。
    我们深深地感觉到党所提出的在少数民族地区进行整风，进行社会主义教育和反对地方民族主义的斗争是十分正确的。经过这一整风和斗争，将使我们新疆的社会主义建设和全国各地一样取得更大的成就，我们宗教界人士和全国其他各界人士一样，将不断地改造自己的思想，提高自己的觉悟，和各族各界人民一起共同为幸福的社会主义和共产主义社会贡献自己的力量积极奋斗。
    最后，我完全同意国务院关于迅速平定西藏叛乱集团的命令，同时还希望西藏僧俗人民为了祖国的统一，民族的团结尽一切力量，积极支援人民解放军彻底平息叛乱，使西藏自治区早日成立，使西藏人民迅速摆脱封建奴隶制度，很快地走上社会主义幸福的生活。我坚决反对印度扩张主义分子对我国内政进行干涉的无耻行为，任何人想分割我们祖国的统一和各民族的团结，将都要遭到可耻的失败。
    让我最后高呼：
    全国各族人民大团结万岁！
    中国共产党万岁！
    各族人民的伟大领袖毛主席万岁！
