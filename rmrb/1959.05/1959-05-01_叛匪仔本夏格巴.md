    Rebel Official Tsebong Shakabpa

    Tsebong Shakabpa was an important official in the former Tibetan local government. He came from a prominent Tibetan aristocratic family. He studied in England and was a loyal lackey cultivated by the British imperialists for many years. In 1948, the Tibetan local government sent him to the United States and Britain to "seek aid" from these imperialist countries. In 1951, he fled from Lhasa to Kalimpong, where he colluded with imperialists and Indian expansionists in activities to betray the motherland. He was one of the heads of the "Tibetan Welfare Association," a counter-revolutionary organization established by the rebels in Kalimpong. During the suppression of the rebellion at Geduilin, our army captured the original copies of two secret telegrams sent to him by the rebels.
