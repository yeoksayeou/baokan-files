On several issues concerning leadership in industrial construction:
    On the issue of ensuring key projects: There should not be too many key projects arranged, so as not to disperse forces – ensuring key projects and arming oneself is a unity of opposites – under the premise of ensuring key projects, it is necessary to both yield and leap forward.
    On the issue of technical revolution: The main purpose of the increase production and practice economy movement centered on technical revolution is to improve labor productivity – technical revolution must be combined with the comprehensive completion of the state plan – technical revolution must have a certain focus in a certain period.
    On the issue of combining strengthening centralized leadership with vigorously launching mass movements: In 1958, there was a wealth of experience in vigorously launching mass movements, but strengthening centralized leadership seemed insufficiently strong. Some people do not understand that not promoting democracy will alienate the masses, and not strengthening centralized leadership will also alienate the masses.
    On the issue of the greater the enthusiasm of the masses, the more attention should be paid to the lives of the masses: It must be clear that the higher the communist style of the masses not talking about conditions in their work and not calculating rewards for their labor, the more the leadership must pay better attention to improving working conditions and caring for the improvement of the lives of the masses. Therefore, the principle of distribution according to labor must be resolutely implemented in labor and wage issues.

    We fully support Premier Zhou's "Government Work Report" and the reports by Vice-Premiers Li Fuchun, Li Xiannian, and Vice-Chairman Peng Zhen.

    In 1958, under the brilliant light of the Party's General Line, the 2.3 million people of Wuhan, like all parts of the country, experienced an unprecedented situation of a Great Leap Forward in industrial production, capital construction, and other undertakings, and achieved brilliant successes. As a relatively large socialist industrial city in Central China, Wuhan shoulders a glorious and arduous task in industrial construction. According to the state's plan, it must build itself into a powerful socialist industrial base in Central China. Faced with such a glorious and arduous task, Wuhan, like other fraternal cities across the country, must maintain a relatively high speed in industrial construction and industrial production in order to smoothly complete its tasks.

    During the entire First Five-Year Plan period, especially in the first year of the Second Five-Year Plan – 1958 – under the correct leadership of the Central Government and Hubei Province, Wuhan achieved construction achievements and maintained a relatively high speed. In terms of the total value of industrial output, in the First Five-Year Plan period, 1957 increased by 194.4 percent compared to 1952, while 1958 increased by 87.98 percent compared to 1957. Among them, the proportion of production means in the total value of industrial output increased from 36.01 percent in 1957 to 45.1 percent in 1958. The world-renowned Yangtze River Bridge was completed and opened to traffic one year and three months ahead of schedule. Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation's No. 1 blast furnace was put into production nine months and eighteen days ahead of the original plan. Coke ovens No. 1 and No. 2 were also completed and put into production nine months and nineteen days and two months ahead of schedule, respectively. Wuhan Heavy Machine Tool Plant was also completed and put into production one and a half years ahead of the original plan in 1958, and its production capacity increased by 60 percent compared to the original design capacity.

    In order to meet the needs of the Great Leap Forward in industry and agriculture and lay the foundation for Wuhan's basic industry as soon as possible, several new industrial zones were opened up in the Guanshan, Wudong, Gedian, and Xujiapeng areas in the suburbs of Wuhan in 1958. This decision was made only in August 1958. By the end of the year, the Guanshan Industrial Zone had already taken shape. Now, four factories, including the steam turbine plant and the steam turbine generator plant, the blower plant, and the integrated motor plant, have been initially built. Half a year ago, Guanshan was still a wilderness, but now it is a small industrial city with factories standing in rows, employee residences in large areas, and various service industries fully equipped. The large-scale casting and forging center factory, marine special machinery factory, and welding rod factory, which are newly built in the Wudong area, are also under intensive construction. The huge hydraulic press workshop will strive to be put into production in July this year.

    In the past, Wuhan was basically a consumer commercial entrepot city, historically known as the "thoroughfare of nine provinces." After liberation, some industries were built, but they were mainly light industry and mechanical industry for repairing and patching. After the construction during the First Five-Year Plan period, especially after the Great Leap Forward in 1958, it has entered a new stage where it can manufacture relatively large, precise, and complex products and complete sets of equipment in batches. In 1958, the city produced nine sets of ironmaking blast furnace equipment ranging from 28 cubic meters to 83.5 cubic meters, with an annual iron production capacity of 884,000 tons; converter equipment ranging from 0.3 tons to 0.5 tons, with an annual steel production capacity of 1,435,000 tons. Since this year, it is producing complete sets of rolling mills, drum coal feeders, bucket elevators, Red Flag coking oven supporting equipment, steam turbines and steam turbine generators, various irrigation and drainage equipment, mining equipment, train vehicles, etc. for the country.

    The production and construction plan for 1959, formulated on the basis of the great victory in 1958, is also in line with the spirit of high-speed leap forward. Most of the main workshops of Wuhan Iron and Steel Corporation will be completed and put into production this year. No. 2 blast furnace, which is 50 cubic meters larger than No. 1 blast furnace, is now in the stage of intense installation and will be put into production in June and July. It is estimated that five open-hearth furnaces, three coke ovens, and refractory material plants will also be completed and put into production this year. The production capacity after the completion of these construction projects this year will reach an annual production of 1.2 million tons of iron, 500,000 tons of steel, and 150,000 tons of steel products. In 1959, the output of major products that we expect to be completed and put into production, such as steel, cement, rolling equipment, mining equipment, electric smelting equipment, etc., will increase by one to several times compared to last year, while light chemical products such as cotton yarn, cotton cloth, paper, enamelware, cigarettes, and medicines will also have a large increase compared to 1958.

    In short, the entire industrial construction in the Wuhan area is comprehensively leaping forward at a high speed, and is striding forward towards the goal of building a powerful socialist industrial base.

    The main reason why we can move forward at such a high speed is because we have the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee, the Central People's Government, and Chairman Mao. The Party's General Line for building socialism illuminates our path forward like a lighthouse, thereby greatly mobilizing the enthusiasm of the people throughout the city. People have liberated their minds, broken superstitions, and demonstrated soaring revolutionary vigor. At the same time, they have gradually learned to closely combine soaring vigor with scientific analysis, and to unify hard work with smart work, thus generating tremendous material strength.

    The road we have traveled in the past has provided us with rich experience and paved the way for us to strive for greater, better, and more comprehensive leaps forward in the future. After winning the victory of high-speed advancement in 1958, in order to realize the grand plan for 1959, the Party and government leaders of Wuhan City, according to the instructions of the Central Committee and the Provincial Party Committee, the Provincial People's Committee, and based on our existing work foundation and practical experience in our work, at the end of January this year, we issued a call to the people throughout the city to carry out an increase production and practice economy movement centered on technical revolution. This call immediately received a warm response from the people throughout the city. People faced new difficulties on the road forward, launched new battles, and launched a red flag competition movement of three highs (high output, high quality, high labor productivity) and ten comparisons (compare output, compare output value, compare cost, compare profit, compare labor productivity, compare equipment utilization rate, compare safety, compare overall perspective and collaboration perspective, compare work style – both dare to think, dare to speak, dare to act, and be down-to-earth). In this way, in the context of insufficient raw materials and extremely tight labor force, we overcame various difficulties and overfulfilled the state plan for the first quarter by 1.58 percent, and increased by 98.4 percent compared to the same period last year. In the new battle, we further realized that the following issues must be paid special attention to on the road to continued progress:

    First, in implementing the correct policy of "the whole country as one chessboard," we must have a very firm attitude and determination in ensuring key projects. The issue is not only to understand the importance of ensuring key projects in terms of general principles, but especially to conduct repeated screenings in practice, resolutely shorten the battle line, and concentrate forces (human and material) to ensure that key projects are truly guaranteed. At the beginning, many of us were confident that we understood the importance of ensuring key projects, but in actual implementation, we saw that many projects were important here and important there. As a result, this became a key project and that became a key project. Too many key projects were arranged, but in reality, they were still spreading out across the board and advancing simultaneously, dispersing forces. After the instructions from the Central Committee and Hubei Province, as well as the lessons learned in actual work, we have now determined the most prominent key projects in the city in the smelting industry to ensure pig iron and coke; in mechanical production to ensure the matching of rolling mills; and in capital construction to ensure Wuhan Iron and Steel and the casting and forging center plant. Secondly, in practice, we have also realized that ensuring key projects and arming oneself is a unity of opposites. We must be good at unifying this contradiction so as not to hinder key projects because of arming oneself, or because one's own arming is not enough, one cannot serve key projects well. The key to properly handling this issue lies in the need to arm oneself in a planned and purposeful manner, that is, to clearly define that arming oneself is to ensure key projects, and one must never launch arming oneself aimlessly, because arming oneself for the sake of arming oneself will inevitably cause the dispersal of leadership energy, labor, equipment, and materials, making it impossible for urgently needed equipment to be complete sets, and making the production of key products lose its guarantee. After this period of practical lessons, we now clearly define arming ourselves purposefully and plannedly to ensure key projects, which avoids the above-mentioned problems and makes the two complement each other. Thirdly, under the premise of ensuring key projects, we must also concretely implement the spirit of both yielding and leaping forward. In order to ensure key projects, any unit and any valuable human and material resources must contribute everything to key projects, but everything is for key projects, and key projects cannot replace everything. It can only drive everything, so under the premise of ensuring key projects, non-key units must actively strive to move forward by all means in the spirit of self-reliance and create conditions for a leap forward. Because key projects can never move forward in isolation, millions of products, under the principle of not hindering the advancement of key projects, flourish in self-reliance, which in essence plays a positive role in supporting ensuring key projects. Under the guidance of this idea, many light chemical products in the city are now completing or overfulfilling the plan by all means despite many difficulties, which also proves the correctness of the principle of key projects driving the general and the key link leading everything.

    Second, the main purpose of carrying out the increase production and practice economy movement centered on technical revolution is to improve labor productivity, rather than building increase production and practice economy on simply increasing the labor force, adding new equipment, or increasing labor intensity. Only by grasping the central link of technical revolution can we achieve a continuous Great Leap Forward. However, at the beginning of practice, some units often easily oppose the completion of production tasks with technical innovation, thinking that the tasks are so heavy, where is the time to engage in technical revolution? In the face of heavy tasks, they are prone to simply working overtime and increasing labor intensity, only emphasizing hard work and neglecting smart work. In this way, the increase production and practice economy movement is actually a clumsy work that cannot last, which is very detrimental to completing tasks.

    After the technical revolution has been launched, it must be emphasized that the technical revolution should be combined with the comprehensive completion of the state plan, and it must be prevented from engaging in technical revolution for the sake of technical revolution. After some units launched this movement, although a considerable number of rationalization proposals, technical innovations, trial-produced new products, and inventions emerged, because they were not combined with the comprehensive completion of the state plan, many innovations were made, but the tasks were not completed well. This is caused by not understanding the purpose of the technical revolution.

    After the purpose of the technical revolution is understood, it is necessary to further clarify that the technical revolution must have a certain center in a certain period, and the key issues and weak links in current production should be the center and main direction of the technical revolution in this period. For example, Hubei Provincial Prospecting Machinery Plant seized the center of insufficient equipment and vigorously made its own equipment to arm itself, which ensured the overfulfillment of the plan for 1958 and the first quarter of this year. The Wuhan textile system prominently grasped the weak link of rectifying the mechanical conditions, which also provided the most important guarantee for the completion of the production plan. Conversely, if some units have unclear centers and do not highlight the main direction, the technical innovation will appear to be unremarkable, and the completion of tasks will also be affected.

    Third, the issue of combining strengthening centralized leadership with vigorously launching mass movements. Regarding the issue of vigorously launching mass movements in enterprises, the experiences provided to us in the year 1958 are very rich. Now these experiences are still very valuable and are being insisted on, promoted, and developed, such as "two participations, one reform, and three combinations," "three deliveries" (deliver tasks, deliver difficulties, deliver measures), "four bigs" (big airing, big letting go, big-character posters, big debates), etc., especially leading cadres participating in labor together with workers in the form of "going down to the company to be soldiers" at the key locations of production. Wherever there is the most difficulty, there are leading cadres, which has played a great role in inspiring the enthusiasm of the masses and promoting the completion of tasks. However, we still lack experience in strengthening centralized leadership while vigorously launching mass movements. The current situation is that strengthening centralized leadership seems insufficiently strong and cannot be well coordinated with the mass movements. Some chaotic phenomena have appeared in enterprise management. For example, in the great destruction and great establishment of rules and regulations last year, many unreasonable rules and regulations were indeed destroyed, liberating productive forces and promoting the enthusiasm of the broad masses, but some things that should not have been destroyed were destroyed, and things that should have been established have not had time to be established in a timely manner. Also, some things that were not originally destroyed, but because the leadership did not grasp them tightly, formed a spontaneous flow, so that some very good systems were also abolished invisibly, affecting the establishment of normal production order and making the very important statistical supervision work stagnate. As a result, this has caused dissatisfaction among the workers and has affected the improvement of production. Some people unilaterally believe that the masses only hope to promote democracy, but they do not know that the masses also very much hope to strengthen centralized leadership. Not promoting democracy will of course alienate the masses, and not strengthening centralized leadership will also alienate the masses. Currently, emphasizing strengthening centralized leadership on the basis of continuing to vigorously launch mass movements has become an urgent requirement of the masses. The responsibility of the leadership is to adapt to this requirement and quickly strengthen this aspect of the work. However, strengthening centralized leadership today must be closely combined with mass movements, and it is by no means returning to the old path. For example, it is certainly wrong to take a wind-swept approach to the destruction and establishment of rules and regulations, but it is also wrong to simply take the leadership's decision to restore the original state in the establishment and improvement of rules and regulations. It is necessary to launch the masses, through the masses' debates, and the leadership's approval, and then separately decide what should be abolished, what should be established, what should be restored, what should be improved, supplemented, revised, etc. This is the real use of two legs to walk, not one leg.

    Finally, the more we leap forward, the more enthusiastic the masses are, the more we must care about the lives of the masses. Due to the improvement of the political awareness of the staff and workers, in the past year, not only did they display soaring vigor and create a miracle of high-speed development in industrial construction, but also, at the request of the masses, reforms were carried out on some unreasonable treatments passed down from history, such as unreasonable piece-rate wages and various cumbersome reward systems. We have done a lot of work in caring for the lives of the staff and workers, and the broad masses are satisfied. But this, like the destruction and establishment of other rules and regulations, also abolished some reasonable systems that should not have been abolished, so that some of the principles of distribution according to labor were not fully reflected in the issues of wages and rewards. Although the masses have not raised any objections due to the improvement of their awareness, it must be clear in the leadership's thinking that the higher the communist style of the masses not talking about conditions in their work and not calculating rewards for their labor, the more the leadership must pay better attention to improving working conditions, caring for the improvement of the lives of the masses, and making the issues of wages and rewards more reasonable. The more the leadership cares about the masses in these aspects, the higher the masses' revolutionary vigor and communist style will be. Therefore, the principle of distribution according to labor must be resolutely implemented in labor and wage issues, and political command must be combined with appropriate material rewards. These principles should be discussed with the masses to properly resolve issues such as worker promotion, partial restoration of piece-rate wages, formulation of reward systems, and other related issues. The result of doing so will further inspire the enthusiasm and vigor of the masses and better complete the plan.

    We believe that under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee, Chairman Mao, and the Central People's Government, through further efforts in the above-mentioned aspects, especially further improvements in many ideological understandings, we will certainly be able to achieve the task of building Wuhan into a powerful socialist industrial base at a high speed.

　　关于领导工业建设中的几个问题
    关于确保重点的问题：重点安排不能过多，以免分散力量——确保重点和武装自己是个矛盾的统一体——在确保重点的前提下必须既让路又跃进。
    关于技术革命的问题：以技术革命为中心的增产节约运动的主要目的是提高劳动生产率——要把技术革命同全面完成国家计划结合起来——技术革命在一定时期必须有一定的中心。
    关于加强集中领导和大搞群众运动相结合的问题：一九五八年在大搞群众运动方面已有十分丰富的经验，但是在加强集中领导方面显得不够有力。有人不懂得：不发扬民主固然会脱离群众，不加强集中领导，也同样会脱离群众。
    关于群众干劲越大，越要关心群众生活问题：必须明确：群众中的工作不讲条件，劳动不计报酬的共产主义风格愈高，则领导上就愈要更好地注意改进劳动条件，关心群众生活的改善。因此在劳动工资问题上必须坚决执行按劳分配的原则。
　　朱早弟　宋一平　李冬青　陈经畲  唐午园　彭仰钦　杨德重　鲍鼎代表的联合发言
    我们完全拥护周总理所作的“政府工作报告”和李富春副总理、李先念副总理、彭真副委员长的报告。
    一九五八年，武汉市二百三十万人民，在党的总路线光辉照耀下，在工业生产，基本建设及其它各项事业建设中，也如同全国各地一样，出现了前所未有的国民经济大跃进的局面，获得了辉煌的成就。作为华中地区一个比较大的社会主义工业城市来说，武汉市在工业建设方面所肩负的任务，是光荣而艰巨的，按照国家的计划，它要把自己建设成为华中地区的一个强大的社会主义工业基地。面对着这样光荣和艰巨的任务，武汉市和全国的各个兄弟城市一样，必须在工业建设和工业生产中保持较高的速度，才能顺利地完成自己的任务。
    在整个第一个五年计划期间，特别是第二个五年计划的第一年——一九五八年中，在中央和湖北省的正确领导下，武汉市建设的成就，保持了较高的速度。以工业生产总产值来说，在第一个五年计划期间，一九五七年比一九五二年增长了百分之一百九十四点四，而一九五八年比一九五七年，就增长了百分之八十七点九八，其中生产资料的生产，在工业总产值中的比重，就由一九五七年的百分之三十六点零一，提高到一九五八年的百分之四十五点一。举世闻名的长江大桥提前一年零三个月建成通车，武钢一号高炉比原计划提前九个月零十八天投入了生产，一、二号焦炉也分别提前九个月零十九天和提前两个月建成投入生产。武汉重型机床厂，比原订计划也提前一年半，于一九五八年建成并投入了生产，其生产能力比原设计能力提高了百分之六十。
    为了适应工农业大跃进的需要，早日奠定武汉市基本工业的基础，在一九五八年内，又在武汉郊区的关山、武东、葛店及徐家棚等地区，开辟了几个新的工业区，这是一九五八年八月才作出的决定，到年底，关山工业区就已初具规模，现在已经有汽轮机厂和汽轮发电机厂、鼓风机厂、综合电机厂等四个工厂初步建成了，半年前还是一片荒野的关山，现在已是厂房林立，职工住宅成片，各种服务行业一应俱全的一座小工业城市了。在武东地区新建的规模巨大的铸锻中心厂、船用特机厂和电焊条厂，现在也在加紧施工，巨大的水压机车间将在今年七月力争投入生产。
    过去的武汉市，基本上是一个消费的商业转口城市，历史上人们称之为“九省通衢”，解放后建设了一些工业，但主要是轻工业和修修补补的机械工业，经过第一个五年计划期内的建设，特别是经过一九五八年内的大跃进，已经进入了可以成批制造比较大型的、精密的、复杂的产品和成套设备的新阶段。在一九五八年内，全市就生产了二十八立方公尺到八十三点五立方公尺的炼铁高炉设备九套，年产生铁能力达到八十八点四万吨；零点三到零点五吨的转炉设备，年产钢能力达到一百四十三点五万吨；今年以来，正在为国家生产成套的轧钢机、滚筒给煤机、斗式提升机、红旗炼焦炉配套设备、汽轮机和汽轮发电机，各种排灌设备、矿山设备、列车车辆等等。
    在一九五八年巨大胜利的基础上制定的一九五九年生产和建设计划，也同样是合乎高速度跃进的精神的。武汉钢铁公司大部分主体车间，将在今年建成投入生产，比一号高炉还要大五十立方公尺的二号高炉，现已进入紧张安装阶段，六、七月份投入生产，今年预计可以建成投入生产的还有平炉五座，焦炉三座，以及耐火材料厂等等。今年这些建设项目完成后的生产能力，将达到年产生铁一百二十万吨，钢五十万吨，钢材十五万吨。在一九五九年内，我们预计可以建成投入生产的主要项目，从主要产品的产量来说，钢铁、水泥、轧钢设备、矿山设备、电冶设备等等，都将比去年增加一倍到几倍、而棉纱、棉布、纸张、搪瓷用品、卷烟、医药等轻化工产品，也将比一九五八年有很大增长。
    总而言之，武汉地区的整个工业建设，正在高速度地全面跃进着，正在向着建成强大的社会主义工业基地的目标大踏步地前进着。
    我们之所以能以这样高的速度前进，最主要的原因，就是因为我们有了党中央、中央人民政府和毛主席的英明领导，党的建设社会主义的总路线，像灯塔一样地照亮着我们前进的道路，从而极大地调动了全市人民的积极性。人们解放了思想，破除了迷信，发扬了冲天的革命干劲，同时，逐步地学会了把冲天干劲同科学分析紧密地结合起来，把苦干和巧干统一起来，因而产生了巨大的物质力量。
    过去走过的道路给我们提供了丰富的经验，为我们争取今后更大更好更全面的跃进，开辟了途径。在争得了一九五八年高速度前进的胜利之后，为着实现一九五九年的宏伟规划，武汉市的党政领导上，根据中央和省委、省人委的指示精神，根据我们已有的工作基础和工作中的实际体会，在今年元月底，我们向全市人民发出了开展以技术革命为中心的增产节约运动的号召，这一号召，立即获得了全市人民的热烈响应，人们迎着前进道路上的新的困难，展开了新的战斗，掀起了三高（产量高、质量高、劳动生产率高）十比（比产量、比产值、比成本、比利润、比劳动生产率、比设备利用率、比安全、比全面观点和协作观点、比作风——既敢想敢说敢干，又踏踏实实）的红旗竞赛运动。这样，就在原材料不足，劳动力十分紧张的情况下，克服了种种困难，在第一季度内，工业总产值超额百分之一点五八完成了国家计划，和去年同期相比，又增长了百分之九十八点四。在新的战斗中，又进一步地体会到如下一些问题，是在继续前进的道路上，必须特别加以注意的：
    第一，在贯彻执行“全国一盘棋”的正确方针上，对于确保重点，必须要有十分坚决的态度和决心。问题不仅仅在于从一般原则精神上认识确保重点的重要性，尤其需要在实践中，进行反复排队，坚决缩短战线，集中力量（人力和物力），才能使重点得到确实的保证。开始时，我们许多人都满以为懂得了确保重点的重要性了，　而在实际执行中，却看到许多项目这也重要，那也重要，于是，形成这也是重点，那也是重点，重点安排过多，而实际上却仍然是全面铺开，齐头并进，分散了力量。经过中央和湖北省的指示，以及在实际工作中的教训，现在我们才在冶炼工业方面把确保生铁与焦炭；在机械生产上确保轧钢机的配套；在基建上确保武钢与铸锻中心厂等几个全市最突出的重点确定下来了。其次，在实践中，我们还体会到确保重点同武装自己是一个矛盾的统一体，必须善于把这个矛盾统一起来，才能不致因为武装自己而妨碍重点，或者因为自己武装不够而不能很好的服务于重点。妥善处理这一问题的关键，就在于必须有计划有目的地来武装自己，也就是必须明确为保证重点而武装自己，决不能漫无目的地发动武装自己，因为这样为武装自己而武装自己，必然造成领导精力、劳动力、设备和材料的分散，使迫切需要的设备不能成套，使重点产品的生产失去了保证。经过这一段实践的教训，现在我们明确了有目的有计划的为确保重点而武装自己，这就避免了上述这种毛病，而使二者相辅相成地统一起来了。其三，在确保重点的前提下，还必须把既让路又跃进的精神，加以具体的贯彻。为了确保重点，任何单位，任何可贵的人力物力，都必须为重点而贡献出自己的一切，但是一切为了重点，而重点却不能代替一切，它只能带动一切，所以在确保重点的前提下，非重点的单位，必须本着自力更生的精神，千方百计地积极努力前进，创造跃进的条件。因为重点决不能孤立的前进，千百万种产品，在不妨碍重点前进的原则下，在自力更生之中繁荣茂盛起来，这实质上正是为确保重点起了积极的支援作用。在这一思想指导之下，目前全市轻化工的许多产品，虽然困难很多，但却在千方百计之中完成或超额完成了计划，这也就证明了重点带动一般，纲举目张的道理的正确性。
    第二，开展以技术革命为中心的增产节约运动的主要目的是提高劳动生产率，而不是把增产节约建筑在简单增加劳动力，增添新设备或增加劳动强度上面。只有抓住技术革命这个中心环节，才能实现连续不断的大跃进。但在实践之初，却往往有些单位易把完成生产任务同技术革新对立起来，认为任务那样重，哪有时间搞技术革命？他们在繁重任务面前，易于走向单纯加班加点，增强劳动强度上去，只强调苦干而忽视巧干，这样，实际上是使增产节约运动不能持久下去的拙干，对完成任务是十分不利的。
    在技术革命已经开展起来之后，就必须强调把技术革命同全面完成国家计划结合起来，必须防止为技术革命而技术革命。有的单位，一经开展这一运动之后，涌现出的合理化建议、技术革新、试制的新产品和创造发明虽然为数不少，但由于没有同全面完成国家计划结合起来，以致革新虽多，而任务却完成得不好，这就是技术革命的目的性没有弄明白所造成的。
    在技术革命的目的性弄明白之后，还必须进一步明确技术革命在一定时期，必须要有一定的中心，而当前生产中的关键问题和薄弱环节，就应该是这一时期技术革命的中心和主攻方向，例如湖北省探矿机械厂抓住设备不足这一中心而大力自制设备武装自己，就保证了一九五八年和今年一季度计划的超额完成。武汉市纺织系统，突出地抓住了整顿机械状况这一薄弱环节，也就使完成生产计划得到了最主要的保证。反之，有的单位中心不明，主攻方向不突出，则技术革新就显得没有起色，而任务的完成亦受到影响。
    第三，加强集中领导与大搞群众运动相结合问题。关于企业中大搞群众运动问题，在一九五八年一年中，给我们提供的经验是十分丰富的，现在这些经验，仍然十分宝贵，并且正在坚持推广和发扬，例如“两参一改三结合”、“三交”（交任务、交困难、交措施）、“四大”（大鸣、大放、大字报、大辩论）等等，特别是领导干部以“下连当兵”的形式，到生产关键所在之处，去同工人一起参加劳动，那里最困难，那里就有领导干部，这对于鼓舞群众积极性，推动完成任务起了很大的作用。但是，我们对于大搞群众运动的同时，又要加强集中领导这一问题，却还是缺乏经验的，目前的情况正是在加强集中领导方面显得不够有力，不能很好地同群众运动配合起来，在企业管理上出现了某些混乱现象，如在去年对于规章制度的大破大立之中，确实破掉不少的不合理的规章制度，解放了生产力，发扬了广大群众的积极性，但也有些不该破的东西破了，该立的尚来不及及时的建立起来，也有些本来没有破的，但由于领导上抓得不紧，形成自流，以致有些很好的制度，也无形中废除了，影响了正常生产秩序的建立，使十分重要的统计监督工作，处于停滞状态。这样一来，就引起了工人群众的不满，影响了生产的提高，有的人片面的认为群众只是希望发扬民主，而不知群众也同样十分希望加强集中领导，不发扬民主固然是会脱离群众的，而不加强集中领导，也同样是会脱离群众的。目前强调在继续大搞群众运动的基础上加强集中领导，已成为群众的迫切要求，领导的责任就是要适应这种要求，迅速地加强这方面的工作。但今天加强集中领导，必须同群众运动紧密结合起来，而决不是回到过去的老路上去，例如，对于规章制度的破立问题，采取一风吹的办法固然是不对的，但如在建立与健全规章制度中，又简单化地采取领导决定，一律恢复原状的办法也是不对的，必须在发动群众的基础上，通过群众的辩论，领导的批准，然后分别决定该废、该建、该恢复、该改进、补充、修订等等，这才是真正的用两条腿走路，而不是用一条腿走路。
    最后，越是大跃进，越是群众的干劲冲天，越是要关心群众的生活问题。由于职工群众政治觉悟的提高，在去年一年中，不但发扬了冲天的干劲，创造了高速度发展工业建设的奇迹，而且对于历史上传下来的一些不合理的待遇，如不合理的计件工资和种类繁重的各种奖励制等等也在群众要求下，进行了改革，在关心职工群众生活方面，我们做了许多工作，广大群众是满意的。但这也如同其他规章制度的破立一样，也有的不该废除的合理制度废除了，以致在工资奖励等问题上有的未能充分体现按劳取酬的原则，由于群众觉悟的提高，虽然没有提出什么意见，但在领导思想上，必须明确：群众中的工作不讲条件，劳动不计报酬的共产主义风格愈高则领导上就要愈更好的注意改进劳动条件，关心群众的生活改善，和使工资奖励等问题上更加合理，而领导上愈是在这些方面关心群众，则群众革命干劲和共产主义风格也就愈高。因此，在劳动工资问题上必须坚决执行按劳分配的原则，并且把政治挂帅与适当的物质奖励结合起来，根据这些原则和群众一道进行讨论，妥善地解决好工人升级，部分恢复计件工资，制定奖励制度，以及其他的有关问题。这样做的结果必将进一步鼓舞群众的积极性和干劲，更好地完成计划。
    我们相信：在党中央、毛主席和中央人民政府的英明领导下，通过上述各方面的进一步的努力，特别是许多思想认识的进一步的提高，我们是一定能够实现高速度地把武汉市建设成为一个强大的社会主义工业基地的任务的。
