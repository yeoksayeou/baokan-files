    Shanghai is Actively Recovering Packaging Supplies
    (Our report) In order to meet the needs of commodity production and development, employees on the commercial front in Shanghai are collaborating with relevant parties, doing everything possible to recover packaging supplies.
    Organizing the recovery of packaging supplies began in Shanghai a long time ago, and has recently seen new developments. For example, small and medium-sized cardboard boxes were rarely recovered in the past. Since cultural stations began recovering these types of packaging supplies at the end of last year, over 57,000 middle packages (i.e., cardboard boxes) for toothpaste alone have been recovered. Assuming each cardboard box holds 20 tubes of toothpaste, this can package 1.15 million tubes. Currently, many stores in Shanghai attach great importance to this work. Sales staff are careful not to damage the packaging when unpacking boxes, in order to recycle and reuse them. After these cardboard boxes are recovered, the paper wholesale department distributes them to various production units for use according to the industry's categorized method. Currently, many factories, including those producing toothpaste, toothbrushes, hardware, machinery, electric motors, electrical appliances, and food, are using these cardboard boxes. According to these factories, these cardboard boxes, because of the dryness inside the boxes, make it easier for goods to be packaged and shipped from the factory in a timely manner.
    In order to facilitate organized recovery, commercial employees in the city have also created many good methods. For example, after creating foldable wooden boxes, employees at the department stores also created a type of foldable bamboo basket. After unloading goods from this bamboo basket, it can be folded up and down, left and right, making its volume smaller, and making it easy to move and store. Currently, this type of bamboo basket is being used to test the packaging of mast lights for shipment to provinces and cities such as Jiangxi and Liaoning. Employees at the knitwear station saw that the gloves produced by Chongming Knitwear Factory were bundled with straw bags, which not only made the gloves prone to mildew and moth damage, but also damaged the straw bags quickly. Therefore, they came up with a way to help them manufacture more than 3,000 cotton bags to transport this commodity, which not only ensured that the goods were not damaged, but also allowed the cotton bags to be recycled and used multiple times.

    上海积极回收包装用品
    本报讯　为了满足商品生产发展的需要，上海市商业战线上的职工正和有关方面协作，千方百计回收包装用品。
    组织包装用品回收，在上海早就开始了，最近又有了新的发展。如中、小型纸盒，过去很少回收，自去年年底文化站开始回收这类包装用品以来，仅牙膏的中包装（即纸盒），就回收了五万七千多个，以每个纸盒装牙膏二十支计算，可装一百一十五万支。目前上海市很多商店对这项工作都很重视，售货员们拆盒时都注意不损坏包装，以便回收再用。这些纸盒回收后，由纸张批发部按行业归口的办法，再分送给各生产单位使用。目前已有牙膏、牙刷、五金、机械、电机、电器、食品等许多工厂使用着这些纸盒。据这些工厂反映，这些纸盒由于盒内干燥，更便于商品及时包装出厂。
    为了便于组织回收，这个市的商业职工还创造了很多好办法。如百货站的职工继制成折叠式木箱之后，又制成一种可以收折的竹篓。这种竹篓在卸完货以后，上下左右一收折，体积变小，搬运存放很方便。目前正在使用这种竹篓准备试装桅灯，发运江西、辽宁等省市。针棉织品站的职工，看到崇明针织厂生产的手套用草包捆扎，不但会使手套容易霉变虫蛀，草包也损坏很快，于是就想法帮助他们制造了三千多条棉毛袋装运这种商品，不但保证商品不受损坏，棉毛袋还可以多次循环使用。
