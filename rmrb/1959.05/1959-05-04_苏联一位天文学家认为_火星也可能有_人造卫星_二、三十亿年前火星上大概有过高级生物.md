Xinhua News Agency, 3rd: TASS reports: The well-known Soviet astronomer Iosif Shklovsky believes that the two satellites of Mars - Phobos and Deimos - may be "artificial satellites" launched by advanced life forms on Mars many years ago.

    Recently, Shklovsky published his new conclusions about the Martian satellites to a reporter from *Komsomolskaya Pravda*.

    Based on numerous observations, Shklovsky concluded that neither the origin of the Martian satellites nor the strange phenomena in the operation of Phobos can be explained by the general theory of natural satellites. Compared with the satellites of other planets in the solar system, Phobos and Deimos have different characteristics. They are particularly small in size and particularly close to their planet. There is also a surprising feature of Phobos: in a few decades, this satellite has advanced 2.5 degrees ahead of its expected operating point in its orbit, and its operating speed has increased. This shows that it is closer to the surface of Mars than before. This phenomenon is exactly the same as the characteristics of artificial Earth satellites. When artificial Earth satellites are affected by atmospheric resistance, they will gradually approach the ground and speed up their operation.

    When talking about the possible existence of life on Mars, the astronomer said that there is almost no oxygen in the Martian atmosphere now, so advanced life forms no longer exist there. However, the situation two to three billion years ago was different. Many astronomers believe that oxygen existed on Mars at that time, and it was probably at that time that highly civilized creatures appeared on Mars.

    苏联一位天文学家认为
    火星也可能有“人造卫星”
    二、三十亿年前火星上大概有过高级生物
    新华社3日讯  据塔斯社报道：苏联著名天文学家希克洛夫斯基认为，火星的两个卫星——“火卫一”和“火卫二”都可能是若干年前火星上高级生物所发射的“人造卫星”。
    不久前，希克洛夫斯基对“共青团真理报”的记者发表了他关于火星卫星的新结论。
    根据多次的观察，希克洛夫斯基得出结论说，无论是火星卫星的起源，或是“火卫一”在运行中的奇异现象，都不能从一般天然卫星的理论中得到解释。“火卫一”和“火卫二”与太阳系其他行星的卫星相比，具有不同的特点，它们的面积特别小，而且距离它的行星也特别近。关于“火卫一”还有一个惊人的特点，在几十年内，这个卫星在自己的运行轨道上，已经比预计的运行点超前了二点五度，而且运行的速度加快了。这说明，它比从前更靠近了火星的表面。而这一现象正与人造地球卫星的特征一样，当人造地球卫星在受到大气阻力的影响时，是会逐渐接近地面而加快运行速度的。
    这位天文学家在谈到火星上可能存在生物的问题时说，现在火星大气中几乎是没有氧气了，因此，那里的高级生物已不存在。但是，在二、三十亿年之前的情况就与此不同，很多天文学家都认为，在那时火星上存在氧气，大概也就在那个时候，火星上出现过有高度文化水平的生物。
