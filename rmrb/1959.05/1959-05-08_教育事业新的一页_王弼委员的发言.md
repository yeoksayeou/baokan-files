A New Page in Education
Speech by Committee Member Wang Bi

Fellow Committee Members, Comrades:

I have listened to Premier Zhou's Government Work Report, Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the draft of the 1959 National Economic Plan, Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1958 State Final Accounts and the 1959 State Budget Draft, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen's report on the work of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and Vice Chairman Li Weihan's report on the work of the Standing Committee of the Second National Committee of the CPPCC. I express my warm and heartfelt support for all of them and will resolutely implement them. In particular, Premier Zhou's report comprehensively summarized the past, pointed out the future, focused on summarizing the great achievements and rich experiences of the Great Leap Forward in 1958, put forward the task of a greater leap forward in 1959, and analyzed in detail the many favorable international and domestic conditions. It clearly pointed out the direction of effort for the people of the whole country, thus inspiring the people of the whole country and leaders at all levels with confidence and full of energy, and will certainly complete and overfulfill the 1959 National Economic Plan and the 1959 State Budget.

The convening of the First Session of the Third National Committee of the CPPCC at the same time as the First Session of the Second National People's Congress, allowing all CPPCC members to attend the National People's Congress and jointly discuss national affairs, has given me great encouragement and enlightenment, taught me many things, improved my ideological level, and enhanced my sense of responsibility to the Party and the country. I therefore believe that all members will be able to make greater efforts and contributions for the people, for the motherland, and for the Party in their work. Therefore, the convening of these two conferences at the same time can be said to be a united conference, a leap forward conference, and a mobilization conference representing the people of the whole country, all democratic parties, all strata, all groups, and all nationalities. This will make the people of the whole country more united than ever under the wise leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and they will all go all out, aim high, and strive to realize a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in 1959. 1959 is a year of decisive significance in the three years of hard struggle, so the completion of this year's leap forward task is of great significance not only for our country's completion of the Second Five-Year Plan and accelerating socialist construction, but also for the influence and encouragement of the entire socialist camp and the national liberation movements in Asia and Africa.

I feel boundless anger at the recent armed rebellion by the former Tibet local government and upper-class reactionary clique, colluding with imperialism, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and foreign reactionaries! Their heinous acts of undermining national unity and betraying the motherland have been resolutely opposed by the people of all nationalities throughout the country. The Tibetan rebel clique regarded the Central Government's attitude of utmost benevolence and righteousness as weakness and thought that imperialism and foreign reactionaries would definitely help them achieve their ulterior motives – to preserve their dark and cruel serf system that enslaved the Tibetan people for a long time. However, their wishful thinking was completely wrong. The era of imperialism enslaving the Chinese people and invading Chinese territory is long gone. Any conspiracy by imperialism and foreign reactionaries to undermine the unity of the people of all nationalities in our country is bound to be defeated shamefully. Tibet is an inseparable part of Chinese territory. The conspiracy of imperialists and foreign reactionaries to split Tibet from China has been met with the most resolute opposition and condemnation from the people of our whole country. The suppression of the Tibetan rebellion is entirely China's internal affair, and no foreign country can interfere. I fully support all the policies and measures of our Central People's Government to quickly put down the Tibetan rebellion. This will enable the Tibetan people to advance more unitedly in the big family of the motherland, along with the people of all nationalities throughout the country, along the new road of democratic socialism!

May I ask the British imperialists and foreign reactionaries, why are they as bereaved as if they had lost their parents at the shameful failure of a small group of rebels and the upper-class reactionary clique in Tibet? You planned the rebellion of the Tibetan reactionary clique beforehand, and after the failure of the rebellion, you fabricated facts, reversed right and wrong, openly interfered in our internal affairs, and even more barbarously insulted the image of our people's leader Chairman Mao, provoking our country and attempting to undermine the friendship between the people of China and India. These acts simply violated the Five Principles initiated by the Prime Ministers of China and India and supported by the people of all countries in the world. You must know that insulting the image of our people's leader Chairman Mao is insulting our 650 million people. The people of our whole country must lodge a serious protest!

I want to seriously warn the British imperialists and foreign reactionaries, do not be delusional. The Chinese people have stood up, and China now is no longer the China of the Qing Dynasty and the Kuomintang era that could be bullied by anyone. It is an independent and powerful socialist China. I advise you to clear your heads. If you do not stop your activities of interfering in our internal affairs, then you will be lifting a stone only to drop it on your own feet, and you will suffer an irreparable defeat and be subjected to well-deserved punishment!

Below, I would like to offer some opinions on the leap forward in culture and education in 1958.

The Huge and Profound Revolution in Education

Premier Zhou mentioned in his report that "the achievements of the education cause are not only reflected in the development of quantity. More importantly, under the greatly strengthened leadership of the Party in education work, we have implemented the policy of education serving the politics of the working class and the combination of education and productive labor, in accordance with the world outlook of the working class and the socialist and communist education principles, thereby launching a huge and profound revolution in the education cause." Vice Premier Li Xiannian mentioned in his report that "culture, education, science, and health undertakings have achieved great development in 1958; the reason why the funds in these areas were not fully used is mainly because the policy of combining education with productive labor and the policy of diligence and thrift in running undertakings were implemented."

Based on what I personally saw and participated in during my work last year, it proves that what is mentioned in the above reports is indeed a thousand-proven, ten-thousand-evidence fact. Now, I will cite two main facts as follows:

The Great Leap Forward in School Education

(1) The Great Leap Forward in school education. In 1958, school education, due to the firm implementation of the Party's policy of education serving the politics of the working class and the combination of education and productive labor, schools ran factories on a large scale, teachers and students participated in productive labor, and the spiritual outlook of the schools was greatly changed. All schools (including universities, secondary specialized schools, and technical worker schools) have realized or are realizing Chairman Mao's instruction of "being both a school and a factory, both a student and a worker." In 1958, school education work, along with the Great Leap Forward in industry and agriculture, also achieved unprecedentedly huge results, mainly manifested in the following aspects:

1. The Party's leadership over school work has been consolidated, the political and ideological awareness of teachers, students, and staff has been greatly improved, and the spiritual outlook of the schools has been greatly changed.

Through the anti-rightist struggle, the all-people rectification movement, and the criticism of bourgeois educational thought, an ideological struggle to promote proletarian ideology and eliminate bourgeois ideology was launched, and the Party's ideological leadership among all teachers, students, and staff was greatly strengthened. "Listening to the Party" and "Responding to the Party's call" have become the actual actions of the vast majority of teachers and students. The Party's educational work policy has become the guiding principle of school work. A atmosphere of everyone caring about politics, loving the motherland, and actively participating in various political activities has formed within the schools, greatly changing the past situation of some schools "studying behind closed doors and not hearing what is happening outside." Last year, all teachers and students enthusiastically devoted themselves to the propaganda of the Party's general line for socialist construction, the demonstration against imperialist aggression in the Middle East, and actively supported agricultural communes in rushing to harvest and plant, building water conservancy projects, accumulating fertilizer, and the Great Leap Forward in steel production. The labor views of the vast majority of teachers and students have undergone fundamental changes, from despising labor to loving labor. The ideological feelings of teachers and students towards the working people have changed, for example, instances of working selflessly, regardless of compensation, and regardless of time, have constantly emerged in various schools.

Under the brilliant illumination of the Party's general line for socialist construction, teachers and students broke superstitions and liberated their minds. Things that were unthinkable in the past have now become reality. For example, airplanes have always been considered high-end complex products that can only be manufactured by specialized aviation factories. No school or teacher or student dared to manufacture airplanes. However, last year, not only did our aviation academies build airplanes, but even three secondary technical schools and a technical worker school without professors and engineers and without the necessary equipment for manufacturing airplanes, relying only on the Party's leadership and their own soaring energy, a group of young teachers and students without production experience, adopted a combination of indigenous and foreign methods, and also designed and manufactured various small civilian airplanes (the engine is temporarily borrowed from existing ones, and it is currently being designed this year), and successfully completed various test flights in the air. This is an unprecedented feat. This fact shows that as long as the masses, under the leadership of the Party, put politics in command and liberate their minds, their power and wisdom are endless, often beyond what we can usually imagine.

2. Through combining education with specialized productive labor, students' practical production knowledge has been increased, and the quality of teaching has been improved. For example, students majoring in aircraft manufacturing only participated in some internships in the past, without personally participating in the manufacture of the entire aircraft. They had more theoretical knowledge from books and insufficient practical production knowledge, and their ability to solve practical problems in production was still lacking. Through the school's own design and manufacture of aircraft, students gained rich practical knowledge and improved their operational skills. In fact, after this group of students graduated, some of them could directly participate in actual production work upon arrival at the factory without going through an internship period.

3. Schools are self-sufficient in funding and can support the construction of new schools, saving national construction funds. Last year, diligent work-study programs were carried out on a large scale. According to incomplete statistics from some schools, the total value of production increased elevenfold compared to 1957. Among them, eleven technical worker schools have all achieved self-sufficiency in funding, with a surplus of nearly 10 million yuan, which can be used as a fund for opening new schools. For example, the Xi'an First Aviation Technical Worker School contracted to build a new technical worker school, namely the Xi'an Second Aviation Technical School, in the manner of "hens laying eggs." The cadres, teachers, machine tool equipment, school building construction, etc. of the new school were all solved by the old school itself. Such diligent and thrifty school management not only trains a large number of technical workers and technical cadres, but also does not cost the state a penny. This is also something we could not have imagined in the past. In the past, schools were institutions that only consumed and did not produce. Through diligent work-study programs, educational revolution combining education with productive labor, and other mass movements, schools have also become production units. This production not only did not hinder the school's training tasks, but on the contrary, improved the quality of training. I think that this experience of running technical worker schools with part-time work and part-time study and diligent work-study programs can not only be greatly promoted in various industrial departments, but also in people's communes in various provinces and cities, running technical worker schools on a large scale, and training a large number of technical workers and technical cadres. This is greatly beneficial to the commune's operation of industry and the development of local industry.

4. Production of machines to support the country's industrial construction. According to incomplete statistics from eleven technical worker schools, in less than a year (actually only half a year), under the conditions of insufficient raw material supply and lack of organizational production experience, they created an output value of more than 30 million yuan, equivalent to the output value of several medium-sized machinery factories. The products produced by various schools range from tools and instruments to motors, diesel engines, blowers, and various machine tools. Under the current situation of insufficient mechanical industrial production capacity in our country, hundreds of higher and secondary specialized schools and technical worker schools at all levels across the country will converge into a considerable force, which will also play a certain role in accelerating the development of the machinery industry. Therefore, it is suggested that this considerable school production force and its material supply be incorporated into the national plan and properly arranged, which is indeed beneficial!

From this, it seems that implementing the Party's educational work policy not only cultivates construction talents, but also improves the quality of training, not only saves national investment, but also produces machines to support the country's industrial construction. Isn't this killing four birds with one stone? As Minister Lu Dingyi said: "The combination of education and productive labor is needed by the socialist revolution, needed by socialist construction, needed by the long-term goal of building a communist society, and needed by the rapid, good, economical, and efficient development of education."

Colorful Staff and Worker Spare-Time Education

(2) The Leap Forward in Worker Education. Popularizing education among enterprise workers is, from the current point of view, necessary for carrying out technological revolution, improving labor productivity, and accelerating socialist construction; from a long-term perspective, it is necessary for realizing the intellectualization of the working masses, narrowing and even eliminating the differences between mental and physical labor, and transitioning to communism. Precisely because popularizing education is necessary for workers, it has received enthusiastic responses from the broad masses of workers as soon as the Central Committee and Party committees at all levels call for it. Under the correct guidance of the Party's educational work policy, worker education also achieved great development in 1958. I would like to illustrate this from two aspects:

1. In terms of quantity: Under the leadership of the Party committee, each enterprise adopted the workshop-run school method of the mass line of "a thousand people teach, ten thousand people learn." Everyone took action, making do with whatever was available, using local materials, and the capable served as teachers. While producing, they were learning. "After work, don't leave the machine shop, sit down and attend class." Many enterprises saw moving scenes of "classrooms everywhere, the sound of reading everywhere." A new communist ethos of everyone working and everyone learning has begun to take shape in many enterprises. The vast majority of enterprises have widely carried out worker spare-time education, and a few enterprises have also tried to run part-time work and part-time study programs. In enterprises with better school-running results, the number of enrolled students has reached more than 85%, and many enterprises have established a complete worker spare-time education system from literacy, primary school, middle school to university. Some have also opened Party schools, Communist Youth League schools, and worker art schools. The development of worker education in the past year swept away the cold and deserted school-running by a few people in the past, forming a situation of "a hundred flowers blooming, all kinds of purples and reds" of mass school-running.

2. In terms of quality: A significant characteristic of the development of worker education last year was to take political education as the key link, closely integrate political, cultural, and technical education, and break away from the set of school education that some enterprises' worker education copied, so that education closely combined with production, powerfully promoted the development of mass technological innovation movements, thereby promoting the development of production. In addition, it is worth mentioning the issue of workers learning philosophy. The working masses broke the superstition that "philosophy is profound" and launched a movement of workers learning philosophy. Worker comrades studied philosophy, lectured on philosophy, and used the ideological method of dialectical materialism to connect with reality, improve their thinking, and achieve the purpose of promoting production. For example, in a workshop of a factory, since September last year, the production task has increased threefold. The task is heavy, and there are great difficulties in manpower and equipment. As a result, some workers developed negative and conservative ideas, lacked confidence, and lacked drive. In response to this situation, the Party branch organized workers to study four philosophical topics: ① Turning bad things into good things, that is, the problem of the transformation of contradictions. Contradictions can be transformed, and there are no difficulties that cannot be overcome. Making a big fuss about technological revolution and breaking through key points can guarantee the completion of production tasks. ② It depends on human effort, that is, the reaction of consciousness. Only by giving full play to subjective initiative can we overcome difficulties and create miracles. ③ The master leads the way, and the practice is up to the individual, that is, the issue of internal and external causes of the changes of things. The help of others is secondary, and the subjective efforts of individuals play a decisive role in giving play to the drive of everyone, so that the backward can catch up with the advanced. ④ Solidarity and mutual assistance is the concept of the whole. To leap forward comprehensively, we must strengthen communist cooperation. Worker comrades acted as professors and lectured on philosophy, starting from real people and real events in the workshop. For example, there was a worker named Li Xiuqing, whose skills were not proficient, and his tasks were often not completed well. He had a great sense of inferiority and did not dare to compare with others. After learning philosophy, he knew that contradictions could be transformed. As long as he worked hard, added drive and hard work, he could catch up with the advanced. He thus solved his ideological knots, was full of energy, and quickly became an advanced producer. Another young worker, who was originally an advanced producer, developed pride and complacency and did not seek to improve. Soon he was left behind and lost the title of advanced. Drawing theories from real people and real events, worker comrades felt that it was kind, easy to understand, and became more and more interested in listening. Once the correct ideas are grasped by the masses, they will produce great material strength. For example, workers wrote well in poems:

Philosophy shines brightly, learning it has a direction;
Difficulties are nothing, contradictions can be transformed;
Hard work plus skillful work, guarantees threefold increase in production;
Satellites are launched into the sky one after another, red flags are planted all over the workshop!

Therefore, some worker colleges invited worker comrades to lecture on philosophy, and they lectured very well and were very popular. This was also a leap forward in worker education last year, something that was unthinkable at ordinary times.

But it is undeniable that there are still many contradictions in carrying out worker spare-time education in enterprises. The first is the contradiction between production and education, and the second is the contradiction between life and education. Facts have proved that as long as the Party committee attaches importance to it and properly arranges the three times of production, life, and study, the difficulties can be solved, that is, the unity of opposites. If the three times are not well arranged, it will expand the contradiction and create a wrong impression that worker education hinders production, which is also a fact and should be paid attention to!

In 1958, our cultural and educational work, under the brilliant illumination of the Party's general line for socialist construction, due to the correct guidance of the Party's educational work policy, the implementation of the policy of walking on two legs of popularization and improvement, the strengthening of the Party's leadership, and the vigorous development of mass movements, achieved an unprecedented leap forward. However, there are still many shortcomings in the work of running factories in schools and running schools in factories, which need to be overcome. We must not be satisfied with the existing achievements at all. I believe that our cultural and educational undertakings will also, like other undertakings, go all out, aim high, and continue to leap forward, and we must achieve a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in 1959!

Whether the above opinions are appropriate or not, please correct me, fellow committee members.

### 教育事业新的一页  王弼委员的发言

专栏：

　　教育事业新的一页
    王弼委员的发言各位委员、各位同志：
    我听了周总理的政府工作报告、李富春副总理关于一九五九年国民经济计划草案的报告、李先念副总理关于一九五八年国家决算和一九五九年国家预算草案的报告、彭真副委员长的全国人大常委会工作报告和李维汉副主席的政协二届全国常委会工作报告，都表示热烈地、衷心地拥护，并坚决贯彻执行。特别是周总理的报告全面地总结了过去，指示了今后，着重总结了一九五八年大跃进的巨大成绩和丰富经验，提出了一九五九年更大的跃进任务，并详细地分析了国际、国内许多有利条件，明确地指出全国人民的努力方向，因此鼓舞了全国人民及各级领导信心百倍，干劲十足，定能完成和超额完成一九五九年国民经济计划及一九五九年国家预算。
    在召开第二届全国人民代表大会第一次会议的同时，召开第三届政协全国委员会第一次会议，使全体政协委员都能列席全国人民代表大会共同讨论国家大事，这给我很大的鼓舞与启发，学到了许多东西，提高了思想水平，更增强了对党对国家的责任感，从而相信各位委员在自己工作中定能为人民、为祖国、为党做出更大的努力与贡献。因此这次两个大会在同一时期召开，可说是一个代表全国人民、各民主党派、各阶层、各团体、各民族的团结大会，跃进大会，誓师大会。这就使全国人民在中国共产党和毛主席英明领导下，比任何时期更加团结了，都将鼓足干劲，力争上游，为实现一九五九年更大更好更全面的跃进而奋斗。一九五九年是苦战三年具有决定意义的一年，所以今年跃进任务的完成，不仅对我国完成第二个五年计划及加速社会主义建设具有重大意义，就对整个社会主义阵营及亚非各国民族解放运动的影响和鼓舞也是很大的。
    我对最近原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团，勾结帝国主义、蒋介石匪帮和外国反动派进行武装叛乱，感到无比愤怒！他们这种破坏民族团结，背叛祖国的罪恶行为，遭到了全国各族人民的坚决反对。西藏叛乱集团把中央仁至义尽的态度，看做软弱可欺，以为帝国主义和外国反动派在他们发动叛乱时，定会帮助他们达到其不可告人的目的——长期保存他们黑暗的残酷的奴役西藏人民的农奴制度。但是，他们的如意算盘完全打错了。帝国主义奴役中国人民，侵略中国领土的时代，早已一去不复返了。任何帝国主义和外国反动派企图破坏我国各族人民团结的阴谋都必然遭到可耻的失败。西藏是中国领土不可分割的一部分。帝国主义者、外国反动派，企图把西藏从中国分裂出去的阴谋，遭到了我全国人民的最坚决的反对和谴责。平定西藏叛乱完全是中国的内政，任何外国不能干涉。我完全拥护我中央人民政府迅速平定西藏叛乱的一切政策和措施。这将使西藏人民在祖国的大家庭中更加团结地和全国各族人民一起沿着民主的社会主义的新生大道前进！
    试问英国帝国主义者及外国反动派，为什么对西藏一小撮叛乱分子、上层反动集团遭到可耻的失败，如丧考妣一样呢？你们事前策划西藏反动集团的叛乱，叛乱失败后，又捏造事实，颠倒是非，公开地干涉我国内政，更野蛮地污辱我国人民领袖毛主席的像，向我国挑衅，企图破坏中印两国人民间的友谊。这些行为简直是破坏了中印两国总理倡议的并得到世界各国人民拥护的五项原则。要知道污辱我国人民领袖毛主席的像，就是污辱我国六亿五千万人民。我们全国人民要提出严重的抗议！
    我要严重地警告英国帝国主义者及外国反动派，你们不要妄想。中国人民已经站起来了，现在中国早已不是清朝和国民党统治时期的可以任人欺负的中国。而是独立强大的社会主义的中国。劝你们将自己的头脑放清醒点，如果再不停止你们干涉我国内政的活动，那就是你们搬石头打自己的脚，将遭到不可收拾的失败，并受到应得的惩罚！
    下面我想就一九五八年文化教育方面的跃进谈几点意见。
    教育事业的巨大而深刻的革命
　　周总理报告里提到“教育事业的成就不只是表现在数量的发展上。更重要的是，在党对教育工作的领导大大加强的条件下，我们按照工人阶级的世界观和社会主义、共产主义的教育原则，贯彻执行了教育为工人阶级的政治服务、教育和生产劳动相结合的方针，从而展开了教育事业的巨大的深刻的革命。”李先念副总理报告里提到“一九五八年文化、教育、科学和卫生事业得到了巨大的发展；这些方面的经费所以没有用完，主要是由于执行了教育和生产劳动相结合的方针，执行了勤工俭学和勤俭办事业的方针。”
    根据我去年在工作中亲眼所见的并亲自参加的情况来看，证明上述报告中所提到的，确实是千证万据的事实。现举出两个主要的事实如下：
    学校教育大大跃进
    （一）关于学校教育方面的大跃进。一九
    五八年学校教育由于坚决贯彻了党的教育为工人阶级的政治服务，教育与生产劳动相结合的方针，学校大办工厂，师生参加生产劳动，学校的精神面貌大为改观。各学校（包括高等学校、中等专业学校和技术工人学校）都实现了有的正在实现着毛主席提出的“既是学校又是工厂，既是学生又是工人”的指示。一九五八年学校教育工作随着工农业大跃进同样地获得了空前巨大的成绩，主要表现在以下几个方面：
    1、巩固地树立了党对学校工作的领导权，师生员工政治思想觉悟大为提高，学校精神面貌大为改观。
    通过反右斗争，全民整风运动，通过资产阶级教育思想的批判，开展了兴无灭资的思想斗争，党在全体师生员工中的思想领导极大地加强了。“听党的话”，“响应党的号召”已成为广大师生的实际行动。党的教育工作方针成为学校工作的指针。学校内部形成了人人关心政治，热爱祖国，积极参加各项政治活动的风气，大大改变了过去某些学校“闭门读书，两耳不闻窗外事”的局面。去年全体师生热烈地投入了党的社会主义建设总路线的宣传，反对帝国主义在中东侵略的示威游行，并且积极地支援农业社抢收抢种、修水利、积肥和大炼钢铁等运动。广大师生的劳动观点发生了根本的变化，从鄙视劳动转变为热爱劳动。改变了师生对劳动人民的思想感情，例如不计报酬、不计时间、忘我劳动的实例，在各校不断地涌现出来。
    在党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，师生们破除迷信，解放思想。过去不敢设想的事，现在变成了事实。例如，飞机一向被认为是高级复杂的产品，只有专业的航空工厂才能制造。任何学校任何师生都是不敢制造飞机的。然而去年，不仅我们的航空学院造出了飞机，就连没有教授和工程师，没有制造飞机的必需设备的三个中等技术学校和一个技工学校，仅仅依靠了党的领导，凭自己的冲天干劲，一群没有生产经验的青年师生们，采取土洋结合的方法，也都自己设计并制造了各种小型的民用飞机（发动机暂借现有的，今年也正在设计中），而且经过空中各种试飞成功。这是史无前例的创举。这个事实表明了，只要在党的领导下，政治挂帅，思想解放了的群众，其力量与智慧是无穷无尽的，往往不是我们平时可以想像到的。
    2、通过教育结合专业的生产劳动，增加了学生的实际生产知识，提高了教学质量。例如，学飞机制造专业的学生，过去只是参加一些实习，而没有亲自参加整架飞机的制造，书本理论知识多，生产实际知识不足，解决生产中的实际问题的能力尚差。通过学校自己设计、制造飞机，同学们获得了丰富的实际知识，提高了操作技能。事实上这批学生毕业后，一到工厂有的不经过见习期就能直接参加实际生产工作了。
    3、学校经费自给自足，并可支援新校建设，节约了国家建设资金。去年大搞勤工俭学，据一些学校的不完全统计，生产总值比一九五七年翻了十一番。其中有十一所技工学校全部达到经费自给自足以外，还结余近一千万元，可作为开办新校基金。如西安第一航空技工学校以“母鸡下蛋”方式包建了一所新技工学校，即西安第二航空技校。新校的干部、师资、机床设备、校舍建筑等全部由老校自己解决。这样的勤俭办学，既大量的培养技术工人和技术干部，又不花国家一个钱。这也是我们过去想不到的事情。过去，学校是事业单位，只消费不生产。通过勤工俭学，教育与生产劳动相结合的教育革命等群众运动，学校也同时成为生产单位了。这种生产不但没有妨碍学校的培训任务，相反地还提高了培训质量。这种半工半读、勤工俭学地办技工学校的经验，我想不仅在各工业部门大大地可以推广，并在各省市人民公社亦可以推广，大办技工学校，大量地培养技术工人和技术干部。这对公社办工业，地方工业的发展上大大有利。
    4、生产机器，支援了国家的工业建设。据十一所技工学校的不完全统计，在不到一年的时间（实际只有半年）内，在原材料供应不充分和缺乏组织生产经验的情况下，创造了三千多万元的产值，相当于好几个中型机械工厂的产值。各学校生产的产品，从工具、仪表到电动机、柴油机、鼓风机和各式机床等。在目前我国机械工业生产能力不足的情况下，全国数以百计的各级高等与中等专业学校和技工学校将汇集成一股不小的力量，对机械工业的加速发展也会起一定作用的。因此建议将这一股不小的学校生产力量及其材料供应，均纳入国家计划，妥善安排，实为有利！
    由此看来，贯彻执行党的教育工作方针既培养建设人才，又提高了培养质量，既节约了国家投资，又生产机器支援了国家工业建设，这不是一举四得吗？确如陆定一部长所说：“教育与生产劳动相结合是社会主义革命所需要的，是社会主义建设所需要的，是建设共产主义社会的远大目标所需要的，是多快好省地发展教育事业所需要的。”
    职工业余教育万紫千红
    （二）关于职工教育方面的跃进。在企业职工中普及教育，从当前看来，是开展技术革命，提高劳动生产率，加速社会主义建设所必需的；从长远看来，是实现工人群众知识化，缩小以至消灭脑力劳动与体力劳动的差别，为向共产主义过渡所必需的。正是由于普及教育是职工所必需的，所以一经中央和各级党委号召，就得到广大职工群众的热烈响应。在党的教育工作方针正确指导下，一九五八年职工教育亦获得巨大的发展。我想从二个方面来说明：
    1、数量方面：各个企业在党委领导下，采取“千人教，万人学”的群众路线的车间办学方法，大家动手，因陋就简，就地取材，能者为师，一面生产，一面学习。“下班不出机工房，坐下就把课来上”，许多企业出现了“处处是课堂，一片读书声”的动人景象。人人劳动，人人学习的共产主义新风尚，已在不少企业中开始形成。绝大多数企业广泛地开展了职工业余教育，少数企业并试办了半工半读。办学成绩较好的企业，入学人数已达百分之八十五以上，不少企业从扫盲、小学、中学到大学，已经建立起一套完整的职工业余教育体系。还有的开办了党校、团校和职工艺术学校。职工教育在去年一年的发展，一扫过去冷冷清清的少数人办学，形成了“百花齐放，万紫千红”的群众办学的局面。
    2、质量方面：去年职工教育发展的一个显著特点是以政治教育为纲，政治、文化、技术教育密切结合，并且打破了某些企业职工教育照搬学校教育的一套，使教育密切结合生产，有力地促进了群众性的技术革新运动的开展，从而促进了生产的发展。另外，值得一提的是工人学哲学的问题。工人群众破除了“哲学深奥”的迷信，开展了一个工人学哲学的运动，工人同志们学哲学，讲哲学，运用辩证唯物主义的思想方法，联系实际，提高思想，达到了促进生产的目的。如某厂的一个车间，去年九月份以来，生产任务增加了三倍，任务繁重，人力、设备均有很大困难，一部分工人由此产生了消极保守的思想，缺乏信心，干劲不足，针对这种情况，党支部组织工人学习了四个哲学题目：①坏事变好事，即矛盾的转化问题。矛盾是可以转化的，没有克服不了的困难。大闹技术革命，突破关键，就可保证完成生产任务。②事在人为，即意识的反作用，只有充分发挥主观能动作用，才能战胜困难，创造奇迹。③师傅领进门，修行在个人，即事物变化的内因外因问题，别人的帮助是次要的，个人主观努力起决定作用发挥每个人的干劲，落后的才能赶上先进的。④团结互助即整体观念。要全面跃进，必须加强共产主义协作。工人同志当教授，讲哲学，从车间真人真事说起。如有一个工人叫李秀清，技术不熟练，任务经常完成得不好，自卑感很大，不敢和别人比，学了哲学，知道矛盾是可以转化的，只要自己努力，干劲加钻劲，就可以赶上先进的，从而解开了思想疙瘩，精神焕发，进步很快，一跃而成为先进生产者，另一青年工人，原来是先进生产者，但是产生了骄傲自满，不求上进，不久就被抛在后面，失去了先进的称号。从真人真事引出理论，工人同志们听了感到亲切易懂，越听越有兴趣。正确的思想一旦被群众所掌握，就会产生巨大的物质力量。例如工人在诗歌中写得好：
    哲学放光芒，学习它来有方向；
    困难不算啥，矛盾可转化；
    苦干加巧干，保证生产翻三番；
    卫星接连升上天，红旗插满全车间！
    因此有的工学院请工人同志去讲哲学，讲得很好，很受欢迎，这也是去年职工教育的跃进，平时不可设想的事情。
    但不可否认，在企业中开展职工业余教育，尚存在很多矛盾。首先是生产与教育的矛盾，其次是生活与教育的矛盾。事实证明，只要党委重视，将生产、生活、学习三种时间加以妥善安排，困难就可解决，即对立面的统一。如果三种时间安排不好，则扩大矛盾，造成错觉，认为职工教育，是妨碍生产的，这也是事实，应注意！
    一九五八年我们的文化教育工作在党的社会主义建设总路线的光辉照耀下，由于党的教育工作方针的正确指导，贯彻了普及与提高两条腿走路的方针，加强了党的领导，大搞群众运动，因而取得了空前的跃进。但是，无论在学校办工厂，工厂办学校的工作上都还存在不少缺点，需要克服。我们丝毫不能满足于已有的成绩。我相信，我国的文化教育事业也将和其他各项事业一样，鼓足干劲，力争上游，不断地继续跃进，一定要实现一九五九年更大更好更全面的跃进！
    上述意见，是否有当，请各位委员指正。
