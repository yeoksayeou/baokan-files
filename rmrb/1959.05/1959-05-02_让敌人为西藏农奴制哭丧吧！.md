    Speech at the First Session of the Second National People's Congress
    Let the Enemy Mourn the Tibetan Serf System!
    Speech by Representative Xu Deheng Mr. Chairman, distinguished delegates, esteemed committee members:
    I am extremely excited after hearing Premier Zhou Enlai's Report on the Work of the Government, Vice Premier Li Fuchun's report on the 1959 National Economic Plan, Vice Premier Li Xiannian's report on the 1958 State Final Accounts and the 1959 State Budget, Vice Chairman and Secretary-General Peng Zhen's report on the Work of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and Vice Chairman Li Weihan's report on the Work of the Standing Committee of the Second National Committee of the CPPCC. I express my complete agreement and enthusiastic support.

    No amount of Rumors and Slander by Imperialists and Reactionaries can Erase the Great Achievements Created by 600 Million People
    Premier Zhou pointed out in his report that the development of China's national economy in 1958 "was a huge, comprehensive leap forward," which is completely in line with the facts. This unprecedented great leap forward is the glorious victory of the General Line for Socialist Construction formulated by the great Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao. It clearly shows that the Chinese people have embarked on a broad road to build socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, and have achieved extremely great achievements. This year, under the wise leadership of the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao, the people of the whole country will continue to exert their utmost efforts, strive for the best, and strive for a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward.
    The 1959 National Economic Development Plan puts forward even more gigantic tasks. This is an extremely inspiring plan for continued leap forward. It fully meets the requirements of the Chinese people to accelerate the building of socialism, and also embodies the heroic spirit of the people across the country to move mountains and fill seas since the Great Leap Forward last year. Therefore, it will inevitably further mobilize all positive factors to strive to overfulfill this magnificent plan in every possible way. The simultaneous convening of the People's Congress and the National Committee of the CPPCC, gathering more than 2,000 representatives from all walks of life across the country, indicates that the unity of the Chinese people under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party has been further expanded and consolidated, and also shows the determination of the people of the whole country to strive for a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward. Our conference is a conference of unity and a conference of leap forward.
    Distinguished delegates, esteemed committee members: Chairman Mao made his scientific prediction in 1949, saying: "With the advent of the high tide of economic construction, there will inevitably be a high tide of cultural construction." This historic prediction ten years ago has become a glorious reality today. No matter how the imperialists and all reactionaries spread rumors and slanders, they cannot erase the great achievements created by our 600 million people. This year, we must make the enemy tremble even more with achievements more splendid than last year.

    Old Intellectuals Must Strengthen Self-Remolding and Contribute all their Strength to Socialist Construction
    In order to realize this year's National Economic Development Plan and launch a greater upsurge of socialist culture, we intellectuals should contribute all our strength. Premier Zhou said in his report:
  "To establish a contingent of tens of millions of working-class intellectuals is a great historical task on the cultural and educational front. This contingent must be generated by relying on the training of new intellectuals and the remolding of old intellectuals." Premier Zhou affirmed here the achievements of the self-remolding work of the old intellectuals, and pointed out: "All old intellectuals who are willing to take the socialist road should continue to work hard and gradually realize self-remolding in the long-term work practice in the future." The vast majority of the members of the Jiusan Society are old intellectuals who are working on the cultural, educational, and scientific fronts and are still in the process of self-remolding. We must deeply understand the spirit of Premier Zhou's instructions, continue to resolutely implement the Party's policy of uniting, educating, and remolding intellectuals, closely integrate serving socialism with self-remolding, and contribute all our strength to the socialist revolution and socialist construction of the motherland.
    Judging from the situation of the members of the Jiusan Society, the anti-rightist struggle and rectification movement that lasted for more than a year, the great leap forward in industry and agriculture last year, especially the mass technical revolution and cultural revolution, the profound educational revolution, the mass movement to march towards science, etc., have all received profound education and training, and generally have made progress to varying degrees. On some major issues, such as the international and domestic situation, the leadership of the Party, the mass line, the self-remolding of old intellectuals, etc., they have gained a relatively correct understanding. Many people not only realize their shortcomings of being divorced from reality, divorced from the masses, and divorced from productive labor, but also have preliminary changes in business practice and labor practice. Some advanced members have already transformed into working-class intellectuals. However, most people have not yet thoroughly solved ideological problems in the struggle between the two roads of capitalism and socialism, and have not completely broken with bourgeois ideology. Premier Zhou instructed us that old intellectuals should continue to work hard and gradually realize self-remolding in the long-term work practice in the future. This instruction points out the direction of our future efforts and gives me great encouragement. We must further "get on the horse of practice and go down to the sea of the masses," actively devote ourselves to the practice of socialist construction, and learn the Party and the country's policies and guidelines more deeply in practice, study Marxism-Leninism and Chairman Mao's works more carefully, and connect with the masses more closely. We must integrate serving socialism and self-remolding more closely, and at the same time promote the enthusiasm for serving socialism and the enthusiasm for self-remolding. Facts have proved that carrying out self-remolding in work practice and expressing the effect of self-remolding through work practice not only meets the requirements of mobilizing all positive factors and accelerating the building of socialism, but also meets the wishes of the old intellectuals to gradually complete self-remolding. We are determined to do our best, follow the Party's wise instructions to us, and continue to move forward.
    The Actions of Indian Expansionists will Surely be Condemned by Peace-loving People all over the World
    The armed rebellion provoked by a small handful of upper-class reactionaries in Tibet is a serious crime of betraying the motherland and undermining unity. With the enthusiastic support of the Tibetan people, the government has quickly quelled this rebellion. I fully support the government's wise measures to deal with this incident. With the suppression of the rebellion and the gradual democratic reforms in Tibet, the unity of our country and the unity of our nation have been further consolidated. No matter what name the imperialists and reactionaries use, or what tricks they play, they cannot undermine the great unity of the people of all ethnic groups in our country, nor can they stop the progress of Tibet. Since the Tibetan rebellion, the imperialists have clamored a lot, and the expansionists of India have also issued a series of absurd remarks. They say that Tibetans are not Chinese and advocate Tibetan independence. This statement is not only reversing black and white, and provoking the feelings of the people of all ethnic groups in our country, but simply rudely interfering in our country's internal affairs. Tibet is an inseparable part of our country's territory, and the Tibetan people are equal members of our country's multi-ethnic family. The so-called Tibetan "independence" is just a conspiracy of British imperialism to try to occupy Tibet. That kind of "independence" is just another name for a colony. India has just emerged from the long-term colonial rule of British imperialism. Now these people are repeating the old tune of British imperialism. What is their intention? Our country is a unified multi-ethnic country. If it is said that the Tibetans and the Han are different and should be independent, then any multi-ethnic country in the world will be split. I would like to ask: Have the people who say such things thought about the situation in their own country? Do they still have the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence jointly initiated by China and India in mind when they publicly make such remarks interfering in our country's internal affairs? China-India friendship is in the interests of the people of both China and India. The imperialists have recently used the Tibetan rebellion to clamor a lot. On the one hand, they are trying to interfere in our country's internal affairs; on the other hand, they are trying to undermine China-India friendship. The Indian expansionists have issued these extremely unfriendly remarks to our country, which cannot but arouse the anger of our people. We cannot but ask, who do they represent? They think they have inherited the mantle of imperialism, but in fact they have become tools of imperialism. Like the people of our country, the Indian people have suffered deeply from the rule of imperialism and deeply hate the vicious means of imperialism to undermine national unity. We believe that these absurd words and deeds of a few Indian expansionists can never represent the opinions of the vast majority of the Indian people, but only expose their true colors. They will not only be opposed by the Indian people, but will also be condemned by peace-loving people all over the world.
    The imperialists and the revisionists who have taken refuge in imperialism have continuously made malicious slanders and clamors about our country's achievements in the Great Leap Forward last year, the establishment of people's communes, the self-remolding of intellectuals, and the suppression of the rebellion of the Tibetan reactionary group. This only shows their hatred and helpless despair for our "getting better day by day." Slander and clamor cannot change the iron-like facts at all, let alone hinder the progress of history. Let the enemy mourn the serf system and struggle to the death. This cannot save their doomed fate. No matter how rampant US imperialism is, we must liberate Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen, and Matsu, and absolutely cannot tolerate the conspiracy to create "two Chinas." No matter how the imperialists and revisionists spread rumors and instigate discord, the unity of our socialist camp headed by the Soviet Union will be more consolidated and more developed. This year, we must make a hundred times more efforts to welcome our glorious and brilliant tenth anniversary of the National Day with a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward!

### 让敌人为西藏农奴制哭丧吧！

    在第二届全国人民代表大会第一次会议上的发言
    让敌人为西藏农奴制哭丧吧！
    许德珩代表的发言主席、各位代表、各位委员：
    听到了周恩来总理的政府工作报告、李富春副总理关于一九五九年国民经济计划的报告、李先念副总理关于一九五八年国家决算和一九五九年国家预算的报告、彭真副委员长兼秘书长关于全国人民代表大会常务委员会的工作报告，李维汉副主席关于政协第二届全国委员会常务委员会工作报告，感到十分兴奋。我表示完全同意并热烈拥护。
    帝国主义和反动派的任何造谣诬蔑，也不能抹杀六亿人民创造的伟大成绩
    周总理在他的报告中指出，一九五八年我国国民经济的发展“是一个巨大的，全面的跃进”，这是完全符合事实的。这种史无前例的大跃进，是伟大的中国共产党和毛主席所制定的社会主义建设总路线的光辉胜利。它鲜明地表示出，我国人民已经走上了一条多快好省地建设社会主义的大道，并且已经取得了极其伟大的成就。今年全国人民在党中央和毛主席的英明领导下，继续鼓足干劲，力争上游，一定能够争取更大、更好、更全面的跃进。
    一九五九年的国民经济发展计划提出了更为巨大的任务。这是一个极其振奋人心的继续跃进的计划。它完全符合我国人民加速建成社会主义的要求，也体现了去年大跃进以来全国人民移山填海的英雄气概，因而必然能够进一步动员一切积极因素，为千方百计超额完成这个宏伟的计划而奋斗。这次人民代表大会和政协全国委员会同时召开，集全国各方面两千多代表人物于一堂，就表示在中国共产党领导下，我国人民的团结更加扩大和巩固，也表示全国人民争取更大、更好、更全面的跃进的决心。我们的大会是团结的大会、跃进的大会。
    各位代表、各位委员：毛主席在一九四九年就发表了他的科学的预见，他说：“随着经济建设高潮的到来，不可避免地将要出现一个文化建设的高潮。”十年前的这一历史性的预言，今天已经成为光辉的现实。无论帝国主义者和一切反动派怎样造谣诬蔑，也不能抹杀我们六亿人民所创造的伟大的成绩。今年我们一定要以较去年更加辉煌的成就使敌人更加发抖。
    旧知识分子要加强自我改造，在社会主义建设中贡献一切力量
    为了实现今年的国民经济发展计划和掀起更大的社会主义文化高潮，我们知识分子应该贡献出自己的一切力量。周总理在报告中说：
  “建立一支成千万人的工人阶级知识分子队伍，是文教战线的一项伟大的历史任务。这支队伍要依靠培养新知识分子和改造旧知识分子而产生。”周总理在这里肯定了旧知识分子自我改造工作的成绩，并且指出：“一切愿意走社会主义道路的旧知识分子，都应当继续努力，在今后长期的工作实践中逐步地实现自我改造。”九三学社的成员绝大多数都是在文教科学战线上工作的、还处于自我改造过程中的旧知识分子，我们一定要深刻体会周总理指示的精神，继续坚决贯彻党的团结、教育和改造知识分子的政策，把为社会主义服务和自我改造密切结合起来，在祖国的社会主义革命和社会主义建设中，贡献我们的一切力量。
    从九三学社的社员情况看来，一年多的反右派斗争和整风运动，去年的工农业大跃进，特别是群众性的技术革命和文化革命，深刻的教育革命，向科学进军的群众性运动等等，都受到了深刻的教育和锻炼，一般都有了不同程度的进步。对于一些重大问题，例如国际和国内形势，党的领导，群众路线，旧知识分子的自我改造等等，都获得了比较正确的认识。许多人不仅认识到自己的脱离实际、脱离群众、脱离生产劳动的缺点，而且在业务实践和劳动实践中已经有了初步的转变。有些先进的社员已经转变成为工人阶级的知识分子。但是多数人还在资本主义和社会主义两条道路的斗争中没有彻底地解决思想上的问题，没有和资产阶级思想实行彻底地决裂。周总理指示我们，旧知识分子应当继续努力，在今后的长期工作实践中逐步实现自我改造。这个指示给我们指出今后努力的方向，也给我以巨大的鼓舞。我们要进一步“上实践之马，下群众之海”，积极投入社会主义建设的实践，在实践中更深入地学习党和国家的方针政策，更认真地学习马列主义和毛主席的著作，更密切地联系群众。我们一定要把为社会主义服务和自我改造更加密切地结合起来，同时发扬为社会主义服务的积极性和自我改造的积极性。事实证明，在工作实践中进行自我改造，使自我改造的效果通过工作实践表现出来，既符合调动一切积极因素，加速建成社会主义的要求，也符合旧知识分子逐步完成自我改造的愿望。我们决心尽最大的努力，遵照党对我们的英明指示，继续前进。
    印度扩张主义分子所作所为，一定要受到全世界爱好和平人民的谴责
    西藏一小撮上层反动分子挑起的武装叛乱，是背叛祖国、破坏统一的严重罪行。在西藏人民的热烈支持下，政府已经迅速平息了这一叛乱。我完全拥护政府处理这一事件的英明措施。随着叛乱的平定和西藏的逐步进行民主改革，我们的国家的统一和民族的团结更加巩固了。不论帝国主义者和反动分子假借什么名义，玩弄什么花枪，也不能破坏我国各族人民的伟大团结，不能阻止西藏的进步。自从西藏叛乱事件发生以来，帝国主义者大肆叫嚣，印度的扩张主义分子也发表了一系列的荒谬言论。他们说西藏人不是中国人，鼓吹西藏独立。这种说法不只是颠倒黑白，挑拨我国各族人民感情，简直是粗暴地干涉我国内政。西藏是我国领土不可分割的一部分，藏族人民是我国各民族大家庭中平等的一员。所谓西藏“独立”只是英帝国主义妄图霸占西藏的一种阴谋，那种“独立”不过是殖民地的别名。印度刚刚从英帝国主义的长期殖民统治下脱离出来，现在这些人竟然重弹英帝国主义的老调，究竟是何居心？我国是一个多民族的统一的国家，如果说藏族和汉族不同就要独立，那么，世界上任何一个多民族的国家都要分裂了。我想问一问：说这样话的人是否想到了自己的国家的情况？公开发表这种干涉我国内政的话，他们心目中是否还有中印共同倡议的和平共处五项原则？中印友好是符合中印两国人民的利益的。帝国主义者最近利用西藏叛乱大肆叫嚣，一方面是妄图干涉我国内政；另一方面是企图破坏中印友好。印度的扩张主义者发表这些对我国极不友好的言论，不能不引起我国人民的愤怒，我们不能不问，他们究竟是代表什么人的利益？他们自以为继承帝国主义的衣钵，其实是做了帝国主义的工具。印度人民和我国人民一样，曾经深受帝国主义统治的苦难，深恨帝国主义的破坏民族团结的恶毒手段，我们相信，印度少数扩张主义者这些荒谬的言行，是绝对不能代表印度广大人民的意见，只不过暴露他们自己的真面目。他们不仅要受到印度人民的反对，而且也一定要受到全世界爱好和平的人民的谴责。
    帝国主义者和投靠帝国主义的修正主义者对于我国去年大跃进的成就，人民公社的建立，知识分子的自我改造，平息西藏反动集团叛乱等等，都连续不断发出恶毒的诬蔑和叫嚣。这只是表现出他们对我们的“一天天好起来”的仇视和无可奈何的绝望心情。诬蔑和叫嚣丝毫不能改变铁一般的事实，更阻碍不了历史的进展。让敌人去为农奴制度哭丧、去作垂死的挣扎吧，这都不能挽救他们的灭亡命运的。不论美帝国主义怎样的张牙舞爪，我们一定要解放台湾、澎湖、金门、马祖，绝对不能容忍制造
  “两个中国”的阴谋。任凭帝国主义者和修正主义者怎样造谣挑拨，我们以苏联为首的社会主义阵营的团结将更加巩固，更加发展。我们今年一定要百倍努力，以更大、更好、更全面的跃进，来迎接我们光辉灿烂的国庆十周年！
