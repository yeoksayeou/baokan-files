    Liuxi River Irrigation Project Completed
    The Liuxi River water diversion and irrigation project in Guangdong Province has been fully completed and began releasing water on April 20. This project will irrigate 450,000 mu of farmland in the suburbs of Guangzhou and Hua County, and eliminate drought and flood disasters.
    The Liuxi River water diversion and irrigation project is located in the middle reaches of the Liuxi River and is one of the large reservoirs built in Guangdong Province. It consists of a 250-meter-long movable dam and more than 700 kilometers of main canals, branch canals, and sub-branch canals, with a total of more than 1,900 large and small structures such as sluice gates, underground culverts, and aqueducts.
    New Cannery in Inner Mongolia
    The Chifeng Cannery in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region went into production in mid-April. The eight kinds of canned foods produced by this cannery, including pork, beef, chicken, and duck, have been tested and found to be of good quality.
    Chifeng City is the economic center of the Zhaowuda League in Inner Mongolia. The animal husbandry in this league is quite developed, with more than 700,000 cattle, more than 2.7 million sheep, and more than 500,000 pigs last year. Recently, the people's communes in the agricultural and pastoral areas here have launched a campaign to increase the production of pigs and poultry. In order to meet the needs of the local people and the domestic market, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has decided to establish a cannery.
    Tieling Coal to be Shipped Out Soon
    The first phase of the Tie (ling) Fa (ku) Railway, for which the Shenyang area troops of the Chinese People's Liberation Army undertook all the roadbed construction, was successfully completed on the eve of "May Day". The first phase of the Tiefa Railway is 31.5 kilometers long and was originally scheduled to be completed in one year, but they only used more than 50 days. During the construction, the officers and soldiers fought against the stubborn mud and frozen soil with the combat spirit of annihilating the enemy in this area eleven years ago. The work efficiency steadily increased, eventually reaching 5.57 cubic meters, exceeding the national quota (2.24 cubic meters) by more than one time.
    Due to the early completion of this railway, the high-quality coal initially mined from the Tieling coal field will soon be continuously transported to support industrial construction in various regions.
