Certain political figures in India, recently taking advantage of the rebellion by the reactionary upper strata in China's Tibet, have been clamoring, interfering in China's internal affairs, and provoking Sino-Indian relations. They even refer to Tibet as a "nation," openly exposing their wild ambition to plot "Tibetan independence." The actions of these people will only be applauded by imperialists and all reactionaries. This not only has nothing in common with the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence initiated by China and India, but it is also completely contrary to the traditional spirit of the vast Indian people who cherish Sino-Indian friendship.

Not long ago, I and two other comrades, representing the Chinese Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee, were invited to India to participate in an All-India Afro-Asian Solidarity Conference held in Calcutta. The conference lasted from April 2nd to 5th, precisely after the publication of the Chinese government's communique on quelling the rebellion of the reactionary upper strata in Tibet and during the period when the Dalai Lama was abducted to India by the rebels. At that time, what we saw and heard inside and outside the conference revealed two distinctly different situations: one was that a small number of ambitious individuals and some political opportunists with ulterior motives were taking the opportunity to stir up trouble, arbitrarily provoke, and attempt to undermine Sino-Indian friendship and Afro-Asian solidarity, diverting the Indian people's struggle against imperialism and colonialism; the other was that the broad masses of the Indian people, including many just and kind people from all walks of life in India, valued Sino-Indian friendship and insisted on Afro-Asian solidarity. They resolutely opposed those ambitious people using the Tibetan issue to interfere in China's internal affairs, emphasizing that Sino-Indian friendship is an important cornerstone of Afro-Asian solidarity and a tremendous force for safeguarding world peace, and must not be allowed to be sabotaged by anyone.

The Indian Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee is a very broad organization. This All-India Afro-Asian Solidarity Conference was attended by 1,500 delegates from all over India. This conference reflected the tremendous efforts made by the Indian people in recent years, under the encouragement of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and the spirit of the Bandung Conference, to enhance Sino-Indian friendship, strengthen Afro-Asian solidarity, persist in the anti-imperialist and anti-colonialist struggle, and safeguard national independence and world peace. Especially at this stage, when the tide of national independence movements in the vast Afro-Asian region is unprecedentedly high, and the forces of imperialism and colonialism are facing final collapse, they are frantically struggling to find some topics to divert the attention of the Afro-Asian people and undermine the unity of Afro-Asian countries, thereby weakening the firepower of the anti-imperialist and anti-colonialist struggle. Therefore, the holding of this conference was very timely. We are very happy to have the opportunity to see the true feelings of the Indian people at such a moment.

After the news of the armed rebellion by the reactionary upper strata in Tibet was announced, some right-wing groups and political opportunists in India engaged in large-scale activities. Some Indian opportunists are becoming more and more blatant, stepping forward to show their faces. The gongs and drums of groups such as the Praja Socialist Party and the People's League are particularly loud. They organize so-called "Support Tibet Days," organize some sporadic "demonstrations," distribute leaflets, and shed crocodile tears. Some English-language newspapers are filled with provocative and slanderous remarks. They do their best to create an atmosphere, a so-called "pressure," as if the Tibetan issue is no longer China's internal affair but has suddenly become India's problem, as if that small group of Tibetan reactionaries who harm the people and betray the motherland can pretend to be representatives of the 1.2 million people of Tibet. Luokangwa, the traitorous leader who has been fleeing in India for a long time and engaging in conspiracies, led his gang from Kalimpong to New Delhi by plane, and his photo was published in the most prominent position in the center of the front page of the newspaper. One English-language newspaper even published a photo of the Kuomintang gang in Taipei organizing a march of the Three Youth Leagues in the same position; what kind of mixture does this become when it is linked to the news of the demonstration organized by the Indian Praja Socialist Party? I don't know where these people got so much energy. What exactly are they fascinated by? What impact will this chaotic situation have on the Indian people? Honestly speaking, from the desire to care about Sino-Indian friendship and Afro-Asian solidarity, I am worried for our friends in our friendly neighbor, India.

However, these turbid things floating on the surface do not represent the true feelings of the Indian people. During the All-India Afro-Asian Solidarity Conference, when those political opportunists attempted to bring the Tibetan issue, which is entirely China's internal affair, into the conference and openly provoke Sino-Indian relations and undermine Afro-Asian solidarity, they were repeatedly refuted by the delegates. On the second day of the conference, at the Political Subcommittee, the Praja Socialist Party openly put forward two motions smearing China and the Soviet Union, demanding that they be included in the conference resolution: one was to smear China for adopting "imperialist and colonialist policies" in Tibet, and the other was to smear the Soviet Union for implementing "imperialist intervention" in the Middle East. These two absurd proposals were angrily denounced by the delegates. In the end, a vote was taken, with only seven votes in favor of the former and only eleven votes in favor of the latter, while the other six or seven hundred delegates expressed their opposition and unanimously rejected them. It is said that a similar scene occurred when the resolution was passed on the last day of the conference, and the same result was obtained. This situation fully reflects the strong desire of the vast Indian people to abide by the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, develop friendship with China and the Soviet Union, strengthen solidarity among Afro-Asian countries, and persist in the anti-imperialist and anti-colonialist struggle. Even in groups such as the Praja Socialist Party and the People's League, only some leaders insist on the reactionary stance of interfering in China's internal affairs and provoking Sino-Indian relations, and the masses are still unwilling to blindly follow them.

The Indian people generally harbor very friendly feelings towards the Chinese people. On any occasion, this deep feeling will naturally be revealed. During this All-India Afro-Asian Solidarity Conference, from the opening plenary session to the mass rally in the Calcutta grass square on the last day, every time the long-standing friendship between China and India over thousands of years was mentioned, as well as the friendly relations developed on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and the familiar slogan "The people of China and India are brothers," a burst of warm applause always rang out from the crowd; and any remarks made by certain ill-intentioned people to provoke Sino-Indian relations immediately aroused dissatisfaction.

The attempt by some political opportunists in India to take advantage of our Tibetan rebellion to gain some benefits and gain some political capital has now proven to be completely futile. They are desperately throwing sand in the eyes of the masses, but the Indian people's hearts are very clear. We have seen that many fair-minded people in India have also made sober calls, saying that we should not interfere in other countries' internal affairs, do not harm Sino-Indian friendship, and do not undermine Afro-Asian solidarity, because doing so will only benefit the imperialists, and it is very dangerous for India itself. Now, the Dalai Lama has confirmed that the three letters he wrote to General Tan Guansan were written by him personally. The truth of the matter has been revealed. The towering lies relied on by the reactionary traitorous elements in Tibet and the Indian interventionists have collapsed like an avalanche. Clouds cannot cover the sun after all. What else can those who have been blinded by ambition say? The adventure of Indian opportunists on the Tibetan rebellion should arouse the vigilance of all those who cherish Sino-Indian friendship. The friendly relations with a long history between our two great nations must never be allowed to be sabotaged by these interventionist elements. Their words and deeds of interfering in China's internal affairs must be resolutely stopped.

### 不许破坏中印人民的友谊！

　　不许破坏中印人民的友谊！
　　金仲华印度的某些政界人物，最近利用我国西藏上层反动集团的叛乱事件，大肆叫嚣，干涉我国内政，挑拨中印关系，甚至把西藏称为“国家”，公然暴露了策划“西藏独立”的狂妄野心。这些人的行径，只有帝国主义者和一切反动派才会拍手称好。这不仅和中印两国首创的和平共处五项原则毫无共同之处，而且与印度广大人民珍视中印友谊的传统精神，也是完全背道而驰的。
    不久以前，我和其他两位同志代表中国亚非团结委员会，应邀去印度参加了一次在加尔各答举行的全印亚非团结会议。会期从4月2日到5日，正当我国平定西藏上层反动集团叛乱的公报发表之后和达赖喇嘛被叛匪劫持到印度的期间。那时候，我们在会内会外的所见所闻，有两种显然不同的情况：一种是少数野心分子和某些别有用心的政治野心家乘机兴风作浪，恣意挑拨，企图破坏中印友谊和亚非团结，转移印度人民反帝国主义和反殖民主义的斗争方向；另一种是广大的印度人民，包括印度各界许多公正、善良的人士在内，重视中印友谊，坚持亚非团结，他们坚决反对那些野心家们利用西藏问题干涉中国内政，强调中印友谊是亚非团结的重要基石和保卫世界和平的巨大力量，绝不容许任何人加以破坏。
    印度亚非团结委员会是一个很广泛的组织。这次的全印亚非团结会议，有来自印度全国各地的一千五百名代表参加。这个会议反映了近年来印度人民在和平共处五项原则和万隆会议精神的鼓舞下对增进中印友好，加强亚非团结，坚持反帝国主义和反殖民主义斗争，维护民族独立和世界和平所作的巨大努力。特别是在现阶段，亚非广大地区民族独立运动的浪潮空前高涨，帝国主义和殖民主义势力面临最后崩溃，它们在疯狂挣扎中竭力想找到一些题目来转移亚非人民的注意，破坏亚非国家的团结，从而削弱反帝国主义、反殖民主义斗争的火力。因此，这个会议的举行是很适时的。我们很高兴有机会在这样的时刻看到印度人民的真情实感。
    西藏上层反动集团武装叛乱的消息公布后，印度一些右派集团和政治野心家们大肆活动。印度的某些野心分子愈来愈明目张胆，出头露面。什么人民社会党、人民同盟之类的锣鼓敲得特别响，他们搞所谓“支持西藏日”，组织一些零零落落的“游行示威”，发传单，流假眼泪。有些英文大报上则充满了挑拨污蔑的言论。他们竭尽力量造成一种气氛，一种所谓“压力”，似乎西藏的事情已不是中国的内政而忽然变成印度的问题了，似乎那一小撮残害人民、背叛祖国的西藏反动分子竟可以冒充西藏一百二十万人民的代表者了。逃亡在印度长期进行阴谋活动的叛国头子鲁康娃，带领他的一帮人从噶伦堡坐飞机到新德里，他的照片竟被刊登在报纸一版中央最显著的地位。一家英文报甚至把蒋匪帮在台北组织三青团游行的照片，也登在同样的地位；这和印度人民社会党组织游行的新闻联系起来，究竟成了怎样的混合物？我不知道这些人从哪里来了这么大的劲头，他们究竟被什么东西迷了心窍？这样搞得乌烟瘴气，究竟会给印度人民带来什么影响？从关心中印友好、亚非团结的愿望出发，老实说，我是为我们友好邻邦印度的朋友们担一把心的。
    但是，这些浮在面上的浑浊的东西，却并不能代表印度人民的真实感情。在全印亚非团结会议期间，当那些政治野心家企图把完全属于中国内政的西藏问题带进会场，公开挑拨中印关系，破坏亚非团结的时候，一再遭到了代表们的严厉驳斥。会议第二天，在政治小组委员会上，人民社会党公然提出了两个污蔑中国和苏联的动议，要求列入大会决议：一个是污蔑中国对西藏采取了“帝国主义和殖民主义政策”，一个是污蔑苏联对中东实行“帝国主义干涉”。这两个荒谬绝伦的提案，遭到代表们的愤怒指斥，最后投票表决，前者只有七票赞成，后者只有十一票赞成，而其他的六、七百位代表都表示反对，一致加以否决。在会议最后一天通过决议的时候，据说也发生了大致相似的场面，也得到了同样的结果。这种情况，充分反映了印度广大人民要求遵守和平共处五项原则，发展对中苏的友谊，加强亚非国家间的团结，和坚持反帝国主义、反殖民主义斗争的强烈愿望。甚至在人民社会党、人民同盟之类的集团中，也只有一些头子坚持干涉中国内政、挑拨中印关系的反动立场，群众还是不愿意盲从他们的。
    印度人民对中国人民普遍怀抱着非常友好的感情。在任何场合，这种深厚的感情都会自然地流露出来。这次全印亚非团结会议期间，从开幕的大会到最后一天在加尔各答草地广场上的群众大会，每次提到中印两国几千年来的悠久友谊，提到在和平共处五项原则基础上发展的友好关系，以及大家熟悉的“中印两国人民是兄弟”的口号，群众中总是响起一片热烈的掌声；而某些不怀好意的人物发出任何挑拨中印关系的言论，就立刻招来不满意的反响。
    印度的一些政治野心家企图利用我们西藏的叛乱事件，讨些便宜，捞些政治资本，现在证明完全是徒然的。他们拚命向群众眼里掷沙子，但是印度人民的心里是很清楚的。我们看到，印度不少公正人士也曾经发出清醒的呼声，表示不应干涉他国内政，不要损害中印友谊，不要破坏亚非团结，因为这样做只会有利于帝国主义者，而对于印度本身却是很危险的。现在，达赖喇嘛已经证实他给谭冠三将军的三封信是他亲笔写的了。事情的真相已经大白。西藏的反动叛国分子和印度干涉者所依靠的弥天大谎，已经像雪崩一样坍下来了。乌云终究是遮不住太阳的。那些被野心迷了心窍的人们，还有什么话可说呢？印度野心家在西藏叛乱事件上的冒险，应当引起一切珍惜中印友谊的人的警惕，我们两个伟大民族的有悠久历史的友好关系，绝对不容许这些干涉主义分子破坏，必须坚决制止他们的干涉中国内政的言行。
