Xinhua News Agency, 3rd, Colombo - The Ceylon "Forum" Weekly published an editorial on the Tibet situation in its May 1st issue, stating, "Prime Minister Bandaranaike was quite right in pointing out in Parliament last week that the Tibet issue is China's internal affair." The weekly condemned the unreasonable behavior of the prominent supporter of Ceylon's United National Party, Marlewane Gnanissara Thero, for rallying some monks to pass a "resolution" falsely claiming that "Tibet is an independent and autonomous country that has only been invaded by Chinese troops this year." The weekly ridiculed, "These monks would be better off learning a little Tibetan history before hastily passing such a completely unrealistic resolution."

The weekly, in discussing the behavior of certain Indian politicians in supporting the Tibetan rebellion, said, "What if those who oppose land reform and the development of the public sector in India were supplied with weapons to rebel against New Delhi? Would such a rebellion be a national uprising? The world should not condemn those who are trying to implement reforms in Tibet, but rather those foreign conspirators who are providing modern weapons to disgruntled elements who have lost their historical role."

The weekly believes that "Nehru earnestly hopes that the Dalai Lama will resolve his conflict with the Chinese and return to Lhasa. In fact, Nehru had earlier doubted that some letters supposedly written by the Dalai Lama to Chinese generals were genuine. The Dalai Lama has now admitted to Nehru that he wrote these letters, and it seems that the explanation he gave to Prime Minister Nehru for writing these letters, like his statement about the Chinese violating the 1951 agreement without providing details, is unconvincing."

### 锡兰“论坛”周刊发表社论  谴责锡兰反动僧侣就西藏问题无理取闹

    锡兰“论坛”周刊发表社论
    谴责锡兰反动僧侣就西藏问题无理取闹
    新华社3日讯　科伦坡消息：锡兰“论坛”周刊在5月1日的一期就西藏局势问题发表社论说，“班达拉奈克总理上周在议会的讲话中十分正确地指出，西藏问题是中国的内部问题”。这家周刊谴责锡兰统一国民党著名的支持者马勒瓦纳·格纳尼萨拉和尚无理取闹的行为，因为他曾经纠集一些僧侣通过“决议”，胡说什么“西藏是一个独立自主的国家，它只是在今年才受到中国军队的侵略。”这家周刊嘲笑说：“这些僧侣们最好在匆忙通过这种完全不现实的决议以前先学习一点西藏的历史。”
    这家周刊在谈到印度某些政界人士支持西藏叛乱的行为时说，“如果反对印度进行土地改革和发展公营部分的人被供给武器对新德里进行叛乱，情况将会如何呢？这样一种叛乱会是民族起义吗？世界一定不是谴责那些设法在西藏实行改革的人，而是谴责那些向失去历史作用的不满分子提供现代武器的外国阴谋家。”
    这家周刊认为，“尼赫鲁极其希望达赖喇嘛解决他和中国人的冲突而返回拉萨。事实上，尼赫鲁早些时候曾怀疑据说是达赖喇嘛写给中国将军的一些信不是真的。达赖喇嘛现在已向尼赫鲁承认，他写过这些信，看来他就他写这些信的原因向尼赫鲁总理所作的说明，就像他所发表的关于中国人违反了1951年协议这个没有提供细节的声明一样，是不能令人信服的。”
