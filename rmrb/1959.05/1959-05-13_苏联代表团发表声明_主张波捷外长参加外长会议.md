    Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, May 12th (Tass dispatch): The Soviet delegation held a press conference this morning regarding the issue of inviting Poland and Czechoslovakia to participate in the Foreign Ministers' Conference.

    The Director of the Information Department of the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Kharlamov, made the following statement at the press conference: "In the past two days, the Soviet Foreign Minister has held consultations with the foreign ministers of the participating countries of this conference—the United States, Britain, and France. The issue of inviting Poland and Czechoslovakia to participate in the conference with full and equal status was discussed.

    Regrettably, the Western countries' foreign ministers have not yet expressed a positive attitude towards this well-founded proposal from the Soviet delegation.

    In view of this situation, the Soviet delegation intends to formally raise this issue at the Foreign Ministers' Conference today.

    It is clear that the rumors and certain reports circulating on this issue, such as the 'Times' report that the issue of Poland and Czechoslovakia's participation in the conference seems to have been removed from the agenda, are completely unfounded. I am authorized to make an absolutely affirmative statement on this."

    苏联代表团发表声明
    主张波捷外长参加外长会议
    新华社12日讯  塔斯社日内瓦讯：苏联代表团今天上午就邀请波兰和捷克斯洛伐克参加外长会议的问题举行了记者招待会。
    苏联外交部新闻司司长哈尔拉莫夫在记者招待会上作了如下声明：“最近两天来，苏联外交部长同这次会议的参加者——美国、英国和法国的外交部长进行了磋商。谈到了邀请波兰和捷克斯洛伐克以完全平等的资格参加会议的问题。
    遗憾的是，西方国家外长对苏联代表团这个具有充分理由的建议至今没有表示积极的态度。
    鉴于这种情况，苏联代表团打算在今天把这个问题正式向外长会议提出。
    由此可见，就这个问题散布的谣言和某些报道，例如，‘泰晤士报’关于波兰和捷克斯洛伐克参加会议的问题似乎已经从日程上撤消的报道，是没有任何根据的。我受权对此发表绝对肯定的声明。”
