Xinhua News Agency, Buenos Aires, 8th: The Argentine Communist Party recently issued a statement regarding the government's decree banning communist activities. The statement said, "All democrats must be vigilant in the face of this violation of constitutional rights!"

The statement said that this measure "is not only directed against the Communists, but also against all Argentine patriots who are striving to defend democratic freedoms, economic independence, the people's welfare, national progress, and peace, and against all those who oppose the oligarchy, imperialism, and the government's policy of 'austere sacrifice' imposed on the people."

Referring to the government's fabricated accusations that the Communists are preparing to engage in terrorist activities and launch an armed coup, the statement pointed out that "this statement comes from the reactionary arsenal of the (American) Federal Bureau of Investigation." It has been used by successive reactionary governments. "But it is difficult to deceive public opinion today. The Argentine people clearly understand that the Communist Party's policies and practical activities are to safeguard the interests of workers and the people, and to oppose the oligarchy and imperialism. It is these oligarchies and imperialists who should be held responsible for our country's economic and social backwardness." The statement said that the Communists are not isolated in this struggle. The recent elections in Mendoza Province show that the people oppose the government's plan to make the people "endure sacrifices."

The drafters of this order have undermined the principles of the constitution. On the contrary, the Communists will continue to defend the constitution along the path of democracy and progress. The Communists will continue to take legal action. "Those who persecute us will place themselves in an illegal situation. We will appeal to the courts, and first of all, to the people."

The statement said that the Communists will continue to fight alongside the working class and the entire people to defend the interests of the people and the interests of the country. "We are confident that we will be victorious. The era of dictators or reactionary governments serving the interests of the oligarchy and imperialism is gone forever. Now is the era of those democratic and progressive governments, those defenders of the interests of the working class and the people, and those defenders of national independence and peace. They will win the final victory."

Editor's Note: The Argentine government issued a decree on April 27 formally banning the activities of the Communist Party. This decree stipulates that the activities of the Communist Party and all so-called "groups, organizations, and associations directly or indirectly related to or cooperating with the Communist Party" are prohibited. The decree also stipulates the closure of the Communist Party and the organs of the aforementioned groups and organizations, and prohibits the public or secret publication of newspapers and publications of the Communist Party and supporters of the Communist Party.

　　阿根廷共产党发表声明
    坚持为保卫人民利益而斗争
    指出政府禁止阿共活动矛头针对一切爱国者
    新华社8日讯　布宜诺斯艾利斯消息：阿根廷共产党最近就政府关于禁止共产党活动的法令发表了一项声明。声明说，“所有的民主人士在这种违反宪法权利的行动面前，都必须警惕！”
    声明说，这项措施“不仅是针对共产党人而采取的，而且也针对着一切为保卫民主自由、经济独立、人民福利、国家进步以及为和平而努力的阿根廷爱国者，针对着一切为反对寡头政治、帝国主义以及为反对政府强加在人民头上的‘坚忍牺牲’政策的人们而采取的。”
    谈到政府捏造的关于所谓共产党人正在准备采取恐怖行动和发动武装政变的指控，声明指出，“这种说法是从（美国）联邦调查局的反动武库中取来的。”它曾经被历届反动政府所利用过。“但是今天要欺骗舆论就很难了。阿根廷人们清楚地了解，共产党的政策和实际活动是维护工人和人民的利益，反对寡头政治和帝国主义的。正是这些寡头政治和帝国主义应该对我国的经济和社会的落后状态负责。”声明说，共产党人在这场斗争中是不孤立的。门多萨省最近的选举表明，人民反对政府要人民“坚忍牺牲”的计划。
    这项命令的制订者破坏了宪法的原则。相反地，共产党人却将继续沿着民主和进步的道路来保卫宪法。共产党人将继续采取合法的行动。“那些迫害我们的行动的人们将使他们自己置于非法的境地。我们将向法庭上诉，而且首先要向人民上诉。”
    声明说，共产党人将继续和工人阶级以及全体人民一起为保卫人民的利益和国家利益而斗争。“我们确信，我们一定会获得胜利。独裁者或者为寡头政治和帝国主义的利益服务的反动政府的时代已一去不复返了。现在是那些民主的和进步的政府、那些工人阶级和人民利益的保卫者、民族独立与和平的保卫者的时代。他们将会获得最后胜利。”
    编者按　阿根廷政府是在4月27日颁布一项法令正式宣布禁止共产党的活动的。这项法令规定，禁止共产党和一切所谓“直接或间接与共产党有联系或合作的团体、组织和联合会”的活动。法令还规定封闭共产党和上述团体、组织的机关，禁止公开或秘密出版共产党和支持共产党的报纸和刊物。
