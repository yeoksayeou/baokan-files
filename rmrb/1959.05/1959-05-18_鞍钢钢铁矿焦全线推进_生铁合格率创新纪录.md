Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, May 17th: The Anshan Iron and Steel's (An'gang) iron and steel army, in its campaign to increase production and practice economy to produce more and better steel, has achieved a comprehensive victory in the first phase. In the first half of May, compared with April, the average daily output increased by 8.64% for pig iron, 1.73% for steel, 3.89% for sintered ore, and 8.43% for metallurgical coke. The quality of steel products has also improved significantly; among them, the qualification rate of pig iron reached an average of 97.22% in the first half of the month, setting a new record for this year.

In the first half of May, from the mines to the blast furnaces, from the open hearth furnaces to the steel rolling mills, the workers of An'gang launched a competition to "learn from the advanced and catch up with the advanced." The workers of the No. 9 Blast Furnace, the red banner blast furnace of the Ironmaking Plant, in the competition to "learn from Benxi and catch up with Benxi," have increased the utilization coefficient of the blast furnace to 2.176 in the first half of May. The No. 3 Blast Furnace, which is competing with the No. 9 Blast Furnace, also achieved a utilization coefficient of 2.129. They are all full of confidence in striving to surpass Benxi and win the red banner of national blast furnace champion. After the No. 1 Steelmaking Plant promoted the advanced experience of the No. 6 Open Hearth Furnace, the red banner furnace, in maintaining the furnace body, the maintenance of the furnace bodies of all open hearth furnaces has improved. The No. 4 Open Hearth Furnace, due to learning from the advanced experience of the No. 6 Open Hearth Furnace and strengthening furnace body maintenance, has still overfulfilled the production plan for the first ten days of May, even though the furnace body has entered its "old age." The Youth Friendship Furnace, which had lost its red banner due to excessive unplanned furnace repairs, has seen its furnace body utilization coefficient jump to the top among all open hearth furnaces in An'gang in the first ten days of May, thanks to the workers' efforts to focus on furnace body maintenance. The workers of the Second Ore Dressing Section of the Ore Dressing Workshop of the Dagushan Iron Mine, due to promoting the experience of the Fifth Ore Dressing System in improving the quality of concentrate powder and launching a competition centered on quality, the iron content of the concentrate powder averaged 63.36% in the first thirteen days of May, an increase of 1.32% compared to April.

    鞍钢钢铁矿焦全线推进
    生铁合格率创新纪录
    据新华社鞍山17日电　鞍钢各路钢铁大军为多出钢、出好钢而开展的增产节约运动，第一阶段已经取得了全面胜利。5月上半月，平均日产量同4月份比较，生铁增长8.64％，钢增长1.73％，烧结矿增长3.89％，冶金焦炭增长8.43％。钢铁产品的质量也有不少提高；其中，生铁的合格率上半月平均达到97.22％，创造了今年以来的最高纪录。
    5月上半月，鞍钢从矿山到高炉，从平炉到轧钢，各系统的职工都展开了“学先进、赶先进”的竞赛。炼铁厂红旗高炉——九号高炉职工，在“学本溪、赶本溪”的竞赛中，5月上半月已把高炉的利用系数提高到二点一七六；同九号高炉一起竞赛的三号高炉，利用系数也达到二点一二九。他们都满怀信心地要力争赶过本溪，夺取全国高炉冠军红旗。第一炼钢厂推广了红旗炉——六号平炉维护炉体的先进经验以后，各个平炉的炉体维护情况都已好转。四号平炉由于学习了六号平炉的先进经验，加强了炉体维护，在炉体已经进入“老年”期的条件下，依然超额完成了5月上旬的生产计划。曾因非计划修炉多而失去红旗的青年友谊炉，由于职工们狠抓炉体维护，5月上旬的炉体利用系数又跃居到鞍钢各个平炉的首位。大孤山铁矿选矿车间第二选矿工段职工，由于推广了第五选矿系统的提高精矿粉质量的经验，开展了以质量为中心的竞赛，精矿粉的含铁量在5月份前十三天中平均达到63.36％，比4月份提高1.32％。（附图片）
