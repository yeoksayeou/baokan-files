Xinhua News Agency, May 26th, Madrid dispatch: Spain, under the fascist dictatorship of Franco, is encountering a serious economic and political crisis.

After twenty years of fascist dictatorial rule by Franco, Spain's economy today is riddled with holes, the people are impoverished, and the country is financially exhausted. A recent United Press International dispatch from London stated that "Spain is struggling through a severe economic crisis."

The deterioration of Spain's economic situation has occurred despite receiving more than ten billion U.S. dollars in "aid" from the United States. Because the U.S. "aid" is purely military "aid," in recent years, with the exception of a very few industrial sectors related to the military, such as steel and cement, which have seen slight development, many other economic sectors have remained at the level of twenty or thirty years ago. Sectors such as the textile industry, which have always held an important position in Spain's national economy, have not even reached the production level of 1931 today. The production capacity of the textile industry is only utilized at 62%. The shoe industry utilizes 56%. The production of agricultural and livestock products is 8% lower than the production level of 1929. More than 27% of the highways, which are not strategically important, are impassable.

The United States enjoys the right to import capital and goods into Spain tax-free. Three years ago, Spain's gold and foreign exchange reserves were 230 million U.S. dollars, but now they are almost exhausted. The national budget deficit has exceeded 300 million U.S. dollars.

Accompanying this situation is "serious inflation." In the past three years, prices in Spain have risen by 40%, and in 1958 alone, they rose by more than 10%. Those with lower incomes and the middle class are the hardest hit. The Franco regime, under the pretext of "reconstructing" the economy, has for many years implemented policies of restricting wages and reducing consumption, further driving the masses into poverty. According to United Nations statistics, the living standards of Spanish residents are lower than those of any other Western European country.

This situation has led to national dissatisfaction and increasing unrest. A strong undercurrent of opposition to the Franco regime is gathering and developing. Henrike Lister, in an article published in the March issue of the French journal "New Review," said that the desire to restore national independence, which was sold by Franco to U.S. imperialism, is one of the factors that allows Spaniards of different class backgrounds and ideological viewpoints to reach tacit agreements, form alliances, and embark on the path of overthrowing autocratic dictatorship.

The Spanish people's struggle against the Franco regime is first and foremost led by the working class. Since 1957, strikes against the Franco regime have been constantly occurring in Spain. The working class's active struggle against Franco's rule has won the support of its main allies – the rural residents, first and foremost agricultural workers and poor peasants. Marcel Viller, in an article published in the March issue of the French monthly "New Review" this year, said that opposition to Franco's rule is not only growing in various industrial centers, but also in remote provinces. Thousands of workers are acting in concert for the first time, with high morale.

The broad masses of Spanish intellectuals, especially students, have launched a heroic struggle against the Franco regime in the past two years. The strike movement and mass demonstrations in 1958, especially the "National Reconciliation Day" demonstration organized by the Spanish Communist Party on May 5, 1958, opened a new stage in the struggle against the Franco dictatorship.

The development of the struggle of workers and intellectuals against Franco has also had an impact within the Spanish ruling group, putting the ruling group in a process of division, and even the Falange, the main pillar of the Franco regime, is showing signs of disintegration. The "New York Times" believes that there is a "sign of an opposition (to Franco) movement that permeates all levels of people" in Spain. On January 29 this year, the "Spanish Alliance" was formed in Madrid by Spanish "Liberal Royalists" and "Republicans." The French journal "Le Nouvel Observateur" believes that this is "an open challenge to Franco."

The Franco regime has taken brutal repressive measures against the resistance movement. The government has strengthened the so-called "special legal system" to conduct terror trials against those who are dissatisfied with the Franco regime. According to reports, before the Spanish Civil War, there were fewer than 7,000 prisoners in prisons, but this year, according to official materials, there are 18,416 people imprisoned. In the past three days, another eight or nine people have been arrested for secretly promoting strikes among workers. However, as Marcel Viller pointed out in his article, although the dictatorial regime is still rampant, its criminal activities are coming to an end.

    西班牙人民奋起反抗独裁统治
    佛朗哥政权面临严重危机摇摇欲坠
    新华社26日讯  马德里消息：佛朗哥法西斯独裁统治下的西班牙，正在遭遇着严重的经济和政治危机。
    经过佛朗哥二十年的法西斯独裁统治后，西班牙的经济今天正处于百孔千疮、民穷财尽的状态。美国的合众国际社最近从伦敦发出的一条消息中说，“西班牙正在一次严重的经济危机中挣扎”。
    西班牙经济状况的恶化是在得到美国十多亿美元“援助”的情况下发生的。由于美国的“援助”纯系军事“援助”，近年来西班牙除了同军事有关的极少数工业部门、例如钢铁和水泥稍有发展外，其他许多经济部门甚至还停留在二、三十年前的水平上。在西班牙国民经济中一向占有重要地位的纺织工业等部门，今天的生产还没有达到1931年的生产水平。纺织工业的生产能力只利用了62％。制鞋工业利用了56％。农产品和畜产品的生产，比1929年的生产水平还低8％。27％以上的没有战略意义的公路不能通车。
    美国在西班牙享有免税输入资本和货物的权利。三年前西班牙的黄金和外汇储备有两亿三千万美元，现在几乎消耗完了。国家预算的赤字已经超过三亿美元。
    伴随着这种情况而来的是“严重的通货膨涨”。在最近三年中，西班牙物价上涨了40％，单是1958年就上涨了10％以上。受打击最厉害的是收入较低的人和中小阶层。而佛朗哥政权以“改建”经济为借口，多年来实行限制工资、减少消费量的政策，进一步把人民群众引向了贫困。据联合国统计，西班牙居民的生活水平低于其他任何西欧国家。
    这种情况导致了全国的不满和日益动荡不安。一股反佛朗哥政权的有力的潜流正在汇集着、发展着。亨利克·利斯特在法国“新评论”三月号发表的一篇文章中说，恢复自己被佛朗哥出卖给美帝国主义者的民族独立的愿望，是阶级出身和思想意识观点不同的西班牙人取得默契和结成联盟，并走上推翻专制独裁道路的因素之一。
    西班牙人民反佛朗哥政权的斗争首先是以工人阶级为先导。自1957年以来，反对佛朗哥政权的罢工在西班牙不断发生。工人阶级反对佛朗哥统治的积极斗争已经取得自己的主要同盟军——农村居民、首先是农业工人和贫农的支持。马塞尔·维里埃在今年3月间法国“新评论”月刊发表的一篇文章中说，反对佛朗哥统治的活动不仅在各工业中心增长，而且各偏僻省份也参加了反对活动。成千上万的工人第一次一致行动，斗志高涨。
    西班牙广大知识分子、特别是学生近两年来展开了反佛朗哥政权的英勇斗争。1958年的罢工运动和群众示威游行、特别是由西班牙共产党组织、在1958年5月5日举行的“全国和解日”大示威，为反对佛朗哥独裁统治的斗争开辟了新阶段。
    工人和知识分子反佛朗哥斗争的发展在西班牙统治集团内部也产生着影响，使统治集团处于分化过程中，甚至佛朗哥政权的主要支柱长枪党也出现分崩迹象。“纽约时报”认为，在西班牙出现了一个“遍及各阶层人民的反对（佛朗哥）运动的迹象”。今年1月29日在马德里由西班牙“自由保皇党”人和“共和党”人组成了“西班牙联盟”。“法兰西观察家”周刊认为这是“向佛朗哥公开挑战”。
    佛朗哥政权对反抗运动采取了残酷的镇压措施。政府加强所谓“特别法制”来对不满佛朗哥政权的人进行恐怖审判。据报道，在西班牙内战前，监狱里的犯人不到七千人，而今年根据官方的材料说，却囚禁着一万八千四百十六人。最近三天，又有八、九人因为在工人中间秘密宣传罢工而被捕。但是，正如马塞尔·维里埃在他的文章中所指出的，尽管独裁政权还在飞扬跋扈，但是它的罪恶活动却快要结束了。（附图片）
