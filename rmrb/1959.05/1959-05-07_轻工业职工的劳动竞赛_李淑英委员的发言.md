Light Industry Workers' Labor Competition
Speech by Committee Member Li Shuying

Chairman, fellow committee members:

I fully endorse Premier Zhou Enlai's government work report, as well as the reports made by Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and Vice Chairman Li Weihan.

I would like to offer some opinions on the labor competition among light industry workers:

Under the care of the Party and Chairman Mao, and under the brilliant illumination of the Party's general line for building socialism, and guided by the Party's policy of giving priority to the development of heavy industry while simultaneously promoting both heavy and light industries, and through the joint efforts of the people nationwide, China's light industry production has made tremendous progress during the Great Leap Forward of 1958. The total output value of light industry in 1958 increased by about 50 percent compared to 1957, roughly equivalent to twice the average growth rate during the First Five-Year Plan. In particular, the small-scale light industry factories run by the people's communes in the second half of the year numbered 300,000. New developments have also been made in the comprehensive utilization of resources in industries such as oil, salt, and sugar. All of this has played a positive role in supporting socialist construction and improving the people's material and cultural lives.

This year is a decisive year for the "Three Years of Hard Struggle." Since the beginning of the year, light industry workers across the country have actively responded to the call of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party. To achieve an even greater leap forward than in 1958, various industries have launched a massive socialist labor competition in various forms, such as inter-provincial, inter-factory, intra-industry, and intra-work type competitions. For example, on the basis of holding Great Leap Forward rallies in various places, a million salt workers and salt farmers across the country have launched a "six comparison" competition movement centered on technological revolution, comparing output, quality, progress of capital construction, comprehensive utilization, labor productivity, and safety. Currently, in the northern coastal salt areas, which account for about 70 percent of the total output, striving to complete the annual state plan in the first half of the year has become the slogan of action for all workers. On the basis of the original eighteen factories' bumper harvest red flag competition, the paper industry has launched a high-yield, high-quality, low-consumption, and safe competition movement centered on increasing production and practicing economy throughout the industry. Fifteen large sugar factories in the south have also launched an inter-factory competition centered on increasing production. The momentum of the competition, the extent of its organization, and the enthusiasm of the workers are all unprecedented.

In order to achieve the grand leap forward plan for 1959, and to ensure that the widespread labor competition takes firm root, is sustained, and bears fruit, light industry workers across the country are full of confidence and high spirits; they are striving to improve their political awareness and technical skills; helping each other, checking each other, comparing with each other, and promoting each other; focusing on weak links in production and existing problems, everyone is using their brains and finding ways to carry out technological revolution and technological innovation; carefully calculating and saving raw materials; and summarizing, exchanging, and promoting advanced experiences. In short, they are doing everything possible to strive for a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in light industry this year. Everyone is working hard, practically, and cleverly! For example, Li Wenlong, a worker at the Tangda Salt Field, after painstakingly reforming his tools, could rake 41 tons of salt and push 28 tons of salt every day, exceeding the quota by more than one time, and the masses called him a "fire dragon." Such things are numerous in various light industry sectors. In particular, the decision of the Party Central Committee and the State Council to convene a representative meeting of advanced collectives and advanced producers in the fourth quarter of this year has given unlimited encouragement to light industry workers across the country, and has immediately set off a red-hot upsurge of comparing with the advanced, learning from the advanced, and catching up with the advanced in various industries. Everyone is adding effort to effort, and everyone is striving to go to Beijing to report their new achievements to Chairman Mao in person, which has become the greatest aspiration of all workers.

Continue to vigorously carry out mass technological revolution to deepen the increase production and practice economy movement

Past experience has proven that as long as we rely on the leadership of the Party and fully mobilize the masses to vigorously carry out technological revolution, we can improve production efficiency, save raw materials, save labor, and reduce labor load. Only through vigorously carrying out technological revolution can we ensure that the increase production and practice economy movement is carried out in depth in enterprises. For example, continuous cooking, continuous pulping, vacuum suction round wire, and automatic paper drawing technology reforms in the paper industry can increase production capacity by 20 to 70 percent. Another example is the Changlu Tangda Salt Field. Due to the construction of new fields, the increase in chemical products, and the addition of lightering tasks, it was planned that 2,613 additional people would be needed based on the average number of people, but the labor force could not be supplemented. After they handed the difficulties over to the masses for discussion, they basically solved the problem of labor tension by deeply carrying out technological revolution and technological innovation, and popularizing effective advanced experiences. Among them, the Dagutuo area alone adopted the method of discharging while lightering, reducing the processes of unloading trays and building salt, increasing work efficiency by more than one time and saving 741 laborers. In terms of saving raw materials, the potential of various light industry sectors is very large. Taking the paper industry as an example, advanced paper mills only use 900 kilograms of pulp to produce one ton of paper, while general paper mills use more than 1,100 kilograms, a difference of about 200 kilograms. If calculated according to this year's production target of 2.2 million tons of paper, if the loss of pulp is reduced by 10 kilograms per ton of paper (which is possible), 22,000 tons of pulp can be saved throughout the year, and these pulps can be made into 20,000 to 25,000 tons of paper. As long as we try every means and do everything possible to achieve economy, substitution, recycling, increased production for self-use, comprehensive utilization, etc., raw materials will be greatly saved. For example, the Xuzhou Match Factory deeply mobilized the masses and paid attention to saving every bit and piece. After mass technical improvements, the length of the match sticks was changed from 40 cm to 39.5 cm, and the thickness of the box skin was changed from 0.53 mm to 0.5 mm (without much impact on users), saving more than 450 cubic meters of wood throughout the year. If the sticks are shortened by another half centimeter, thinned by 0.07 mm, and changed from 100 sticks to 200 sticks, more than 280 cubic meters of wood can be saved this year (calculated in nine months). Another example is the Hangzhou Huafeng Paper Mill. Because it fully mobilized the masses and boldly carried out technological innovations, it overcame the difficulty of insufficient chemical raw materials and adopted a simple method of combining indigenous and foreign methods to produce its own "acids and alkalis." It can produce more than 6,800 tons of soda ash, caustic soda, bleaching powder, etc. within the year, and can gradually achieve self-reliance by the third quarter.

In particular, in some light industry sectors where manual operations account for a relatively large proportion, the widespread and in-depth technological revolution is even more effective. For example, in the Tangda Salt Field, a worker changed the flatbed cart for pushing salt to a concave cart, which increased labor efficiency by 25 percent without increasing labor intensity.

At present, there is a great distance between advanced factories and general factories in light industry, and advanced experience needs to be seriously promoted

In the past few years, especially in the Great Leap Forward of last year, a large number of advanced experiences have emerged. According to incomplete statistics, 730 advanced technical experiences were generated in only five industries: paper making, salt making, ceramics, glass, and enamel. If these experiences are carefully organized and promoted, the leap forward in light industry production will be accelerated. At present, the difference between advanced factories and general factories in light industry is very large. For example, in the oil and fat industry, advanced factories produce two more jin of oil per hundred jin of raw materials than general factories. If the effective experiences of advanced units are promoted in factories across the country, a lot of oil will be produced throughout the year. Taking cottonseed alone as an example, this year's cottonseed processing volume is 3.66 million tons. If each factory increases the average oil yield by one jin per hundred jin of cottonseed, 36,600 tons more oil can be produced throughout the year. Calculated at 12 jin per person per year, it can feed 6 million people for one year. Another example is the advanced experience of salt field workers in mass-producing brine using indigenous methods, and raising brine with brine, which can accelerate brine production and increase the production of crude salt. Another example is Zhao Dehe, a young worker at the Daokou Oil Factory in Henan, who, encouraged by the Party's call to "catch up with and surpass Britain in 15 years or less," worked hard to study how to quickly improve the cottonseed oil extraction rate. He was not highly educated, but he bought and read many technical theory books. With the support and care of the Party and the help of veteran workers, he finally found an advanced experience to improve the cottonseed oil extraction rate, which increased the cottonseed oil extraction rate of the factory from 95% to more than 97%, setting a national record. The preliminary results of promoting this experience in seven other factories have generally increased the cottonseed oil extraction rate by 5 to 6 percent. If it is promoted to the whole country, the increase in production will be very large. In short, the potential of various light industry sectors is very large. We have full confidence and determination to fully mobilize the masses and rely on the masses under the leadership of the Party, to deeply carry out the increase production and practice economy movement centered on technological revolution and technological innovation, to complete and over fulfill this year's national plan along the victorious road of last year, and to strive for a greater, better, and more comprehensive leap forward in light industry production!

Just as the people across the country are full of confidence and carrying out a great leap forward in socialist construction, the former Tibetan local government and upper-class reactionary clique, colluding with imperialism, the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang, and Indian expansionists, betrayed the motherland and carried out a rebellion. This shameless behavior is intolerable to the people across the country and the broad masses of Tibetan people. Together with the Tibetan people, our People's Liberation Army quickly quelled the rebellion. From then on, the Tibetan people will forever get rid of the dark and cruel feudal serf exploitation system that has existed for many years, and build a socialist and beautiful life together with the people of the whole country. China's internal affairs will never allow interference from Indian expansionists!

　　轻工业职工的劳动竞赛
    李淑英委员的发言主席、各位委员：
    我完全拥护周恩来总理所作的政府工作报告，和李富春、李先念副总理、彭真副委员长、李维汉副主席所作的各项报告。
    我想就轻工业职工劳动竞赛情况发表一些意见：
    我国轻工业生产，在党和毛主席的关怀下，在党的建设社会主义总路线的光辉照耀下，和党在优先发展重工业的基础上，实行重工业和轻工业同时并举等等一整套两条腿走路的方针指导下，经过全国人民的共同努力，在一九五八年的大跃进中，有了巨大的发展。一九五八年轻工业的总产值约比一九五七年增长百分之五十，大体相等于第一个五年计划中平均增长数的两倍；尤其是下半年人民公社所办的小型轻工业工厂就有三十万个；在油、盐、糖等行业中，综合利用也有了新的发展。所有这些，对于支援社会主义建设和改善人民物质文化生活都发挥了积极作用。
    今年是“苦战三年”具有决定性的一年。从年初开始，全国轻工业职工在各条战线上积极响应党的八届六中全会的号召，为实现比一九五八年更伟大的跃进，各行各业掀起了一个声势浩大的省际、厂际、同行业、同工种等多种多样的社会主义劳动竞赛。如盐业在各地召开跃进大会的基础上，全国百万盐工盐民开展了以技术革命为中心的比产量、比质量、比基本建设进度、比综合利用、比劳动生产率、比安全六比竞赛运动。目前，在占总产量百分之七十左右的北方海盐地区，力争上半年完成全年国家计划，已成为全体职工的行动口号。造纸行业在原有十八个工厂丰产红旗竞赛的基础上又在全行业开展了以增产节约为中心的高产、优质、低耗、安全竞赛运动。南方十五个大型糖厂也开展了以增产为中心的厂际竞赛。竞赛的声势之浩大、组织之广泛、职工情绪之高涨，都是空前的。
    全国轻工业职工，为了实现一九五九年宏伟的跃进计划，使广泛掀起的劳动竞赛牢牢扎根、持久深入、开花结果，人人信心百倍、个个干劲昂扬；努力提高政治觉悟和技术水平；互相帮助，互相检查，互相评比，互相促进；围绕生产薄弱环节和存在问题，人人动脑筋，人人想办法，大闹技术革命和技术革新；认真精打细算，节约使用原材料；总结、交流与推广先进经验。总之，千方百计地，努力争今年轻工业更大、更好、更全面的跃进，人人苦干、实干、巧干！如塘大盐场工人李文龙，经过苦钻改革工具后，每日扒盐达四十一吨，推盐二十八吨，超过定额一倍以上，群众称他是“一条火龙”。像这样的事情，在轻工业各行业中是很多的。特别是党中央和国务院决定今年第四季度召开先进集体、先进生产者代表会议后，给全国轻工业职工无限的鼓舞，立即在各行各业掀起了如火如荼的比先进、学先进、赶先进的热潮，人人劲上鼓劲，个个争取上北京，亲自向毛主席汇报新成绩，已成为全体职工的最大愿望。
    继续大搞群众性的技术革命，使增产节约运动深入开展
    过去的经验证明，只要依靠党的领导和充分发动群众，大搞技术革命，就能提高生产效率、节约原材料、节约劳动力，减轻劳动负荷。只有通过大搞技术革命，才能保证增产节约运动在企业中深入开展。如：造纸工业中的连续蒸煮、连续打浆、抽气园网，自动引纸的技术改革，可使生产能力提高百分之二十到百分之七十。又如：长芦塘大盐场，由于建成新场，增加化工产品、增添驳运任务，按平均人数计划需增加二千六百一十三人，但劳动力无法得到补充。他们把困难交给群众讨论后，从深入开展技术革命和技术革新，推广行之有效的先进经验后，基本上解决了劳力紧张的问题。其中仅大沽坨地采用随驳随放的办法减少了卸盘、筑盐等工序后，提高工效一倍以上，节省劳动力七百四十一人；在节约原材料方面，轻工业各个行业的潜力都很大，以造纸工业为例，先进纸厂造每吨纸只用九百公斤浆，一般纸厂就要用到一千一百多公斤，相差二百公斤左右。若按今年二百二十万吨纸的生产任务计算，如果每一吨纸减少十公斤浆的流失（这是可能办到的），全年就可以节约二万二千吨浆，这些浆可以制成二万到二万五千吨纸。只要我们千方百计地想尽一切办法，做到节约代用、回收再用、增产自用、综合利用等等，就会使原材料大量节约。如徐州火柴厂，深入发动群众，注意一点一滴的节约，经过群众性的技术改进，将火柴梗子的长度由四十公分改为三十九点五公分，盒皮的厚度由零点五三公厘改为零点五公厘（对用户无甚影响），全年共可节约木材四百五十多立方公尺。如果将梗子再缩短半公分，改细点零七公厘，将一百支装改为二百支装，今年（以九个月计算），还可节约木材二百八十多立方公尺；又如：杭州华丰造纸厂由于充分发动了群众，大胆地进行技术革新，克服化工原料不足的困难，采用土洋结合的简易办法，自搞“酸碱”生产，在年内可产纯碱、烧碱、漂白粉等六千八百多吨，到第三季度可逐步做到自力更生。
    尤其是在某些手工操作比重比较大的轻工业行业中，广泛深入地开展技术革命，其收效更为显著。如塘大盐场，有个工人将推盐的平板车子改为凹肚车后，在并不增加劳动强度的情况下，使劳动效率提高了百分之二十五。
    目前轻工业先进工厂和一般工厂之间，生产相距甚远，需要认真推广先进经验
    在过去几年中，特别是在去年大跃进中，出现了大量的先进经验，据不完全统计：去年仅造纸、制盐、陶瓷、玻璃、搪瓷五个行业就产生了七百三十多项先进技术经验。若将这些经验认真组织推广，就会加速轻工业生产的跃进。目前轻工业先进工厂和一般工厂之间，相距的差额很大。如油脂工业的出油率，先进厂子比一般厂子每百斤原料要多出两斤油，如果把先进单位行之有效的经验在全国各厂推广开来，全年就会增产不少油。其中单以棉子计算，今年棉子处理量是三百六十六万吨，若各厂在每百斤棉子中平均提高一斤的话，全年就可以多出油三万六千六百吨。按每人每年十二斤计算，可供六百万人吃一年。又如盐场职工所制造的群众性的土法制卤，以卤养卤的先进经验，可以加速制卤，增产原盐。再如河南道口油厂青年工人赵德合，在党所提出的“在十五年或在更短的时间，赶上和超过英国”的号召的鼓舞下，刻苦钻研，研究如何迅速提高棉子精油率。他的文化程度不高，但是买了不少技术理论书看，在党的支持和关怀下，在老工人的帮助下，终于摸索出一条提高棉子精油率的先进经验，使该厂棉子精油率由百分之九十五上升到百分之九十七以上，创全国最高纪录。这项经验经初步在其他七个厂推广的结果，一般使棉子精油率提高了百分之五到百分之六。若再推广到全国，这个增产的数字将是很大的。总之，轻工业各个行业的潜力很大，我们完全有信心、有决心在党的领导下，充分发动群众和依靠群众，深入开展以技术革命和技术革新为中心的增产节约运动，沿着去年胜利的道路，完成和超额完成今年的国家计划，并力争轻工业生产更大、更好、更全面的跃进！
    正当全国人民信心百倍，进行社会主义建设大跃进的时候，原西藏地方政府和上层反动集团，勾结帝国主义、蒋匪帮和印度扩张主义分子，背叛祖国，进行叛乱。这种无耻行为，是全国人民和广大的藏族人民所不能容忍的。我人民解放军和藏族人民一起，迅速的平定叛乱。从此藏族人民，将永远摆脱多少年来黑暗残酷封建农奴剥削制度，和全国人民一道建设社会主义美好生活。我国的内政，决不允许印度扩张主义分子干涉！
