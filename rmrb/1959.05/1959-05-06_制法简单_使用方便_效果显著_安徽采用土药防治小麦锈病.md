    Anhui Adopts Local Remedies to Prevent Wheat Rust
    (Our newspaper Hefei dispatch, 5th) People's communes in Anhui Province are utilizing the experience of eradicating wheat rust last year, adopting various local methods to prevent diseases that may occur this year. Currently, various localities have rushed to produce over 200 million catties of various local pesticides, and various spraying and dusting equipment are also being rushed into production.
    Wheat in Anhui has suffered from varying degrees of rust disease over the years, with severe outbreaks in 1954, 1956, and 1958. In the struggle against wheat rust, the broad masses of farmers have created many effective local methods. In particular, last year, widespread mass prevention and control work was carried out, and various local rust prevention methods were discovered and promoted. 60% of the province's pesticide control area adopted local methods, greatly reducing the harm of rust disease to wheat and ensuring a bumper wheat harvest. This year, Anhui has experienced more rainfall and higher temperatures, and rust disease has been found sporadically in some areas. In order to prevent and control it as early as possible and prevent the spread of rust disease, all localities have further summarized last year's experience, collected various wild plants effective in preventing rust disease according to local conditions, and rushed to produce various local pesticides.
    In areas with excessive rainfall, members of the people's communes are clearing ditches and draining water in wheat fields. Some are also applying fertilizers such as grass ash, wall soil, and stove soil, which can reduce the humidity of wheat fields and enhance the disease resistance of wheat, making it less susceptible to rust disease. In areas where wheat rust has occurred sporadically, various local pesticides have been used for prevention and control.
    Currently, about 60 kinds of local pesticides have been collected and produced in various places. After careful testing and determination by the Provincial Department of Agriculture and local agricultural technology departments, about half of the local pesticides can reduce the germination rate of rust spores by more than 90%. The remaining local pesticides also have a significant effect on inhibiting the germination of rust spores. For example, the grass ash water and smartweed water commonly used by the masses to spray diseased wheat plants have a kill rate of 100% against spores. The use of datura water and artemisia water also kills spores with an efficiency of 98%. Cat's eye grass, a wild plant found everywhere, can kill spores at a rate of 92%.
    The preparation methods of various local pesticides are very simple. For example, cat's eye grass and red smartweed can be soaked or boiled in five catties of clean water per catty, then the dregs are filtered out, and the juice is sprayed. One catty of tea cake water boiled with fifty catties of clean water to extract the juice and sprayed is also effective. One catty of salt dissolved in one hundred catties of clean water can be used directly. Other wild plants, such as spider lily, rhubarb, bitter bark, datura leaves, castor bean leaves, stemona root, rhododendron, Stellera chamaejasme, and yellow artemisia, are generally soaked in water at a ratio of 1:10 to 1:20, and the juice is sprayed for significant effect.
    In addition, farmers in various places are rushing to burn lime, and in the Huainan area, sulfur is extracted from hot spring water in preparation for using a sulfur-lime mixture to prevent wheat rust. Some places, in order to save the amount of sulfur used, have adopted a mixture of local pesticides and sulfur-lime mixture, which is more effective than using sulfur-lime mixture alone.
    Many people's communes are simultaneously manufacturing local pesticides, rushing to manufacture and repair dusting machines, sprayers, small water dragons and other equipment to improve the efficiency of pesticide spraying and save labor.

    安徽采用土药防治小麦锈病
    本报合肥5日电　安徽省各地人民公社正运用去年扑灭麦锈病的经验，采用各种土法来防治今年可能发生的病害。目前各地已赶制了各种土农药二亿多斤，各种喷药、撒药的器械也正在突击赶制中。
    安徽各地小麦历年来都有程度不同的锈病发生，1954年、1956年和1958年麦锈病都很严重。广大农民在与麦锈病作斗争中，创造了很多有效的土办法。特别是去年广泛开展了群众性的防治工作，发掘和推广了各种防锈的土法，全省的药剂防治面积有60％采用土法，大大减轻了锈病对小麦的危害程度，保证了小麦丰收。今年安徽各地雨水较多、气温较高，有些地方已零星地发现了锈病。为了及早防治，不让锈病蔓延，各地都进一步总结了去年的经验，因地制宜地采集各种对防治锈病有效的野生植物和赶制各种土农药。
    在雨水过多的地方，人民公社的社员们都在小麦田里清沟排水，有的并结合施用草木灰、墙土、灶土等肥料，既可减少麦田的湿度，又能增强小麦的抗病力，使小麦不易感染锈病。在已零星发生麦锈病的地方，也都已用各种土农药进行了防治。
    目前各地采制的土农药有六十种左右，经过省农业厅及各地农业技术部门的细致试验测定，约有半数以上的土农药，能使锈病的病菌孢子的发芽率减少90％以上，其余的土农药对抑制锈病病菌孢子的发芽也有显著作用。如群众普遍使用的以草木灰水、蓼草水喷射小麦病株，对病菌孢子的杀伤率达100％，用蔓陀萝水、蒿草水防治，杀伤病菌孢子的效率也达98％。猫儿眼也是各地都有的野生植物，它的杀伤病菌孢子率可达到92％。
    各种土农药的制法都很简单。如猫儿眼草、红蓼草，每斤加五斤清水浸泡或熬煮后，将渣子滤掉，取其汁液喷洒即可。茶饼水一斤加五十斤清水熬煮取汁喷洒也有效。每斤食盐加一百斤清水融化后就可使用。其他如石蒜、大黄、苦树皮、蔓陀萝叶、蓖麻叶、百部根、闹羊花、狼毒根、黄蒿等各种野生植物，一般以一比十至一比二十的水浸泡后，取汁喷洒效果都很显著。
    此外，各地农民都正在赶烧石灰，在淮南地区并以温泉水提炼硫磺，准备采用硫磺石灰合剂防治麦锈病。有的地方为节省硫磺的用量，采取土农药和石灰硫磺合剂混合使用，效果比单用硫磺石灰合剂还好。
    很多人民公社一边制造土农药，一边赶制和修理喷粉器、喷雾器、小水龙等器械，以提高喷撒农药的效率，节省劳动力。
