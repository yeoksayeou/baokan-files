Resolutely Complete the Hemp Planting Plan
By Our Newspaper Commentator

Our newspaper published an editorial on March 27th entitled "Strive for a Greater Leap Forward in Hemp Production." That editorial discussed the close relationship between hemp production and the country's industrial and agricultural construction and the people's lives. It also discussed several issues that must be addressed to achieve a greater hemp harvest this year, with particular emphasis on expanding the planting area of hemp crops and increasing the yield per unit area of hemp fields according to the state plan, hoping that all hemp-suitable regions and people's communes across the country would do their best to fulfill the glorious task given by the state.

More than a month has passed, and now is the time for the full-scale launch of hemp crop planting. How is the hemp planting task being completed? It is understood that some areas with faster planting progress have completed the task, but some areas have slow planting progress, and even individual key hemp-producing areas have repeatedly reduced the hemp planting area. Reducing the hemp planting area is detrimental to completing the hemp production plan. The problem is very obvious: only by increasing the yield per unit area on the basis of a sufficient planting area can a bumper harvest be reliably guaranteed.

Why can some hemp-producing areas complete the state-planned planting area, while others cannot? The main reason is the different degrees of importance attached to hemp production and whether the production arrangements are thorough. According to the state plan, the expansion of hemp planting area this year is not very large; if we attach importance to it ideologically and can make reasonable arrangements, it is entirely possible to complete the state plan. Hunan Province, which has a larger planting plan, has increased its jute production task by about two times this year compared to last year, and 50% of the task is distributed in eight counties along the lake and river. The comrades in this province are full of confidence in completing this year's hemp production task. At the hemp on-site meeting, the Hunan representatives challenged the other provinces, guaranteeing the completion of the planting tasks of 675,000 mu of jute and 826,000 mu of ramie, and ensuring that every field achieves a bumper harvest and that the planting area is the harvest area. Jiangsu Province's planned jute planting area this year is 75,000 mu more than the state plan. Recently, the Provincial People's Committee issued a special instruction, requiring all localities to strive to complete the provincial plan; and instructing all localities: the original plan should not be less than the provincial plan, and should be fixed; the original plan is less than the provincial task target, we must mobilize those communes that are suitable for hemp cultivation and can cultivate hemp to plant more.

Some people in some areas have concerns about growing hemp: they are afraid of labor costs, high investment, wind, drought, and so on. As long as we explain the truth to the masses, so that the masses understand the benefits of growing hemp to national construction and people's lives, to the commune, and to themselves, and make proper arrangements in terms of labor, investment, technology, land, etc., the masses' concerns will be eliminated. Chishan Commune and Nandashan Commune in Yuanjiang County, Hunan, launched a mass debate and calculated the detailed accounts of land, labor, etc. The masses' concerns were eliminated all at once, and they quickly completed the task of expanding the hemp planting area.

The planting opportunity will soon be lost, so don't hesitate any longer. It is hoped that all localities will act decisively in accordance with the requirements for hemp production put forward in the Ten Initiatives of the National Conference of Representatives of Advanced Agricultural Units, immediately take measures, and resolutely ensure the completion of the state plan. In areas where sowing is about to end, it is necessary to quickly check the implementation of the sowing plan, check seedlings and replant; in areas where sowing progress is slow, it is necessary to speed up progress; in areas where sowing has not yet started, it is necessary to strengthen ideological education and implement the hemp sowing plan to the plots as soon as possible, seize the opportunity, and rush to sow. While doing a good job in sowing, fertilizers, medicines and machinery should also be properly arranged. In short, we must start from the beginning and grasp it to the end, and never give up until the hemp production task is completed! (Attached pictures)

### 坚决完成麻类播种计划

　　坚决完成麻类播种计划
　　本报评论员
    本报3月27日曾经发表“争取麻类生产更大跃进”的社论。在那篇社论中，谈到了麻类生产同国家工农业建设事业及人民生活的密切关系；也谈到了要实现今年麻类更大丰收必须注意解决的几个问题，其中特别着重谈到按照国家计划扩大麻类作物的种植面积和提高麻田单位面积产量的问题，希望全国适于种麻的地区和各人民公社，尽力完成国家给予的光荣任务。
    时间过去了一个多月，现在已到了麻类作物播种工作全面展开的时候，麻类播种任务完成得怎样了呢？据了解，有些播种进度较快的地区已完成了任务；但也有一些地区播种进度缓慢，甚至有个别重点产麻地区一再缩减麻类种植面积。缩减麻类种植面积，对于完成麻类生产计划是不利的。问题很明显，只有在足够的种植面积的基础上提高单位面积产量，丰产才有可靠的保证。
    为什么有些产麻区可以完成国家计划种植面积，有的地方却不能完成呢？主要原因是对麻类生产重视的程度不同，对生产的安排周到与否也不相同。按照国家计划，今年麻类种植面积扩大的并不算多；如果思想上重视而又能合理地安排，完成国家计划是完全可能的。种植计划较大的湖南省，今年黄麻生产任务比去年约扩大了二倍，而且50％的任务都分配在滨湖沿江的八个县；这个省的同志们对完成今年麻类生产任务充满了信心。在麻类现场会议上，湖南代表向各省提出挑战，保证完成黄麻六十七万五千亩和苎麻八十二万六千亩的种植任务，并且要做到丘丘丰产，保证种植面积就是收获面积。江苏省今年黄麻计划种植面积比国家计划还多七万五千亩，最近省人民委员会特别发出了指示，要求各地力争完成省计划；并且指示各地：原订计划不少于省计划的，不要再有变动，固定下来；原订计划少于省的任务指标的，要动员那些适宜种麻和能够种麻的公社多种。
    有些地区部分群众对种麻有顾虑：怕费工，怕投资多，怕风，怕旱，等等。只要向群众好好讲清道理，使群众明白种麻对国家建设和人民生活、对公社、对自己的好处，并且切实在劳力、投资、技术、土地等几方面作妥善的安排，群众的顾虑就会消除。湖南沅江县赤山公社和南大膳公社，发动群众辩论，算了土地、劳力等的细账，群众顾虑一下就消除了，很快就完成了扩大麻类种植面积的任务。
    播种时机很快就会失去，千万不可再迟疑了。希望各地按照全国农业先进单位代表会议的十大倡议中对麻类生产提出的要求，当机立断，立即采取措施，坚决保证完成国家计划。在播种快要结束的地区，要赶快检查播种计划执行情况，查苗补种；在播种进度较慢的地区，要加快进度；在尚未播种的地区，要加强思想教育工作，尽快将麻类播种计划落实到地块，抓紧时机，抢播下去。在做好播种工作的同时，对肥料、药械等也要进行妥善安排。总之，要从头抓起，一抓到底，不完成麻类生产任务决不罢休！（附图片）
