    Industrial Reconstruction of the German Democratic Republic
    By Our Correspondent Zhang Xinmin
    Since the end of March, the German Democratic Republic has launched a nationwide discussion on the Seven-Year Perspective Plan. All production units, such as factories, mines, transportation enterprises, and agricultural production cooperatives, are studying specific measures to achieve the plan in their own units, in conjunction with the development of national economy seven-year plan targets proposed by the State Planning Commission. Although the seven-year plan targets proposed by the State Planning Commission are not expected to be announced until after the end of this nationwide discussion in May, some of the main product targets have already been specified in the resolutions of the Fifth Congress of the German Socialist Unity Party last year and in the three documents published after this Congress: the program for the development of the chemical industry, the seven-year plan for agricultural development, and the seven-year plan for the construction industry. For example: In the industrial sector: in 1965, the total industrial output value of the German Democratic Republic will be 150% of that in 1960, of which the output value of the chemical industry will be 164% higher than in 1958, and the output of plastics will increase from the current average of seven kilograms per person per year to sixteen kilograms; in the agricultural sector: in 1965, the average grain yield should reach 3,000 to 3,200 kilograms per hectare; an average of 39 dairy cows should be raised per 100 hectares of arable land, with an average annual milk production of 3,500 kilograms per cow; an average of 130 pigs should be raised per 100 hectares of arable land, and the corresponding feed grain should increase from the current annual output of 5 million tons to 6.3 million tons; in the construction industry: as the main building material, the output of cement in 1965 will increase by 111% compared with the present, the output of concrete components will increase to 13 million tons, and the output of asbestos-cement boards will increase from the current 800,000 square meters to 6.5 million square meters. From these indicators, people can believe that the seven-year plan targets of the German Democratic Republic will certainly be an inspiring program.
    German comrades believe that in the current decisive stage of the economic competition between socialism and capitalism, the realization of their seven-year plan will be the contribution made by the German Democratic Republic to the current stage of the competition. Party and government leaders also emphasized that the core of realizing this plan is speed.
    The Fifth Congress of the German Socialist Unity Party decided last year that the key to increasing the speed of construction is to improve labor productivity, and believes that in the case of the relatively small population of the German Democratic Republic, it is difficult to increase production by increasing the labor force in various departments. Now the industry of the German Democratic Republic is undergoing a comprehensive reconstruction in this direction.
    The comprehensive reconstruction of industry includes not only the construction and expansion of new factories and mines, the installation and updating of equipment, and the adoption of new technologies, but more importantly, changes in the management system, the degree of production concentration, and management methods and working methods. This also includes changes in the relationship between scientists, engineers, technicians, and workers in factories and mines.
    As early as September last year, the Council of Ministers of the German Democratic Republic completed the abolition of various industrial ministries, and formed many "National Enterprise Unions" according to various industrial categories to replace the original industrial ministries in leading the work of various factories and mines, and handed over 565 enterprises to be directly led by the special districts. In the past, the central industrial departments were all in the capital, and there were many levels from the central government to the factory and mine production units, and it was not possible to grasp the situation and solve problems in a timely manner. After the establishment of "National Enterprise Unions", the location of the "National Enterprise Unions" is not necessarily in Berlin, depending on the distribution of enterprises. For example, the Halle Special District is the center of the chemical industry in the German Democratic Republic, and the "National Enterprise Union" of the chemical industry is located in this special district. The number of management levels has been reduced, the connection between the various factories and mines of the same type has been strengthened, and it is easier for cadres to face the masses, which naturally helps the development of production. Because the "National Enterprise Unions" are closely linked with the various production factories and mines, it is also much more convenient for the national planning organs to grasp the situation and carry out leadership. When talking with the economic staff of the German Democratic Republic about the unprecedented development of industry in 1958, people talked with great relish about the positive role played by the change in the industrial management system in this great development.
    This year, on the basis of changing the management system, the scattered production left over from the old capitalist relations of production will be concentrated. The Party and the government have proposed to implement "specialization, standardization, and modularization" in various industrial sectors, and are prepared to promote further concentration of production, better improve labor productivity, and thus accelerate the speed of construction through these "three modernizations". "Specialization, standardization, and modularization" have become one of the central contents of the current industrial reconstruction of the German Democratic Republic.
    The so-called "specialization" means that the production of each factory tends to be specialized. The so-called "standardization" and "modularization" mean that products and processes tend to be unified in standards and modules. Comrades in the German Democratic Republic believe that the realization of these "three modernizations" will make it easier for the mechanization and automation of various factories and mines, and will also promote the further development of science and technology in industry, and labor productivity will also be improved accordingly. Comrades in the German Democratic Republic believe that these "three modernizations" are tasks that cannot be completely solved under capitalist relations of production, especially standardization and modularization, which are impossible to achieve under capitalist relations of production.
    In February this year, the State Planning Commission convened a special meeting to discuss "standardization". The meeting examined the unreasonable phenomenon of excessive product variety left over from the old relations of production in some departments. For example, there are 21 factories in the country producing electric irons, with as many as 41 varieties; and 4 factories in the country producing 14 kinds of household sewing machines; the meeting believes that so many varieties are not needed. From the production point of view, excessive variety is not conducive to improving labor productivity and reducing costs; from the consumer point of view, some difficulties are often brought about in parts and repair work due to excessive variety, especially in agricultural machinery. For example, there are currently 52 types of feed selectors in the country, while according to the situation in the German Democratic Republic, it is enough to reduce them to 27 types. The general manager of the agricultural machinery and tractor manufacturing "National Enterprise Union" believes that this phenomenon of excessive variety is not beneficial to agricultural mechanization; on the other hand, through modularization, the specialization of the agricultural machinery manufacturing sector can be promoted, thereby improving its production capacity and better supplying agricultural machinery.
    With the implementation of specialization, standardization and modularization, some factories have also reorganized the arrangement of workshops. In the past, lathes were in one workshop and milling machines were in another workshop; now, according to the process, machines are grouped and concentrated to form a production network, which greatly improves labor productivity and reduces costs with very little investment. The Sokauniwitz Electric Heating Factory is one example. This factory grouped the machines into six production networks according to the process. The same scale of production tasks originally required 800 workers, but after the reorganization, only 200 workers were needed to complete them.
    What is more noteworthy in the industrial reconstruction is the change in factory management methods and working methods. The Party organization criticized the idea of ​​treating the reconstruction plan as a simple matter that a few design experts could solve in the office, but as a complex political task. The Party organization advocated organizing all engineers, technicians and workers of factories and mines to discuss it together, and relying on them to achieve it. The "October 7th" large lathe manufacturing factory in Berlin set a good example. When drafting the factory reconstruction plan, the Party organization of this factory organized nine groups and six detachments, absorbing more than 1,000 engineers, technicians, master craftsmen, production workers and management personnel to jointly participate in the drafting work, and then took the reconstruction plan to the trade unions and production meetings of various workshops for in-depth discussions, and finally discussed and approved it at the factory's economic meeting. This extensive and in-depth mass discussion laid a good foundation for the factory's reconstruction work.
    The "socialist work collectives" that have developed in factories and mines recently have also had a positive impact on promoting technological progress and improving labor productivity. Under the advocacy of the Socialist Unity Party at all levels, engineers and researchers have changed the situation in the past where they did not have enough contact with practice and workers, and moved towards close integration with workers and production. This kind of "socialist work collective" is currently developing rapidly. The Halle Special District, which has advanced work, has established more than 1,200, and the Greater Berlin area also has more than 300. Advocating the combination of engineers, researchers and workers, advocating the combination of theory and practice, and organizing "socialist work collectives" have become another important content of industrial reconstruction.
    At present, the industrial reconstruction work of the German Democratic Republic has begun, and hundreds of thousands of workers and other working people of the German Democratic Republic are concentrating their efforts to invest in this complex and arduous work. With the realization of industrial reconstruction, people will see that the industry of the German Democratic Republic, which has long enjoyed international reputation, will appear in the world at a higher level.

    德意志民主共和国的工业改建
    本报记者  张辛民
    从3月下旬起，德意志民主共和国在全国范围内展开了一个关于七年远景计划的全民性讨论。工厂、矿山、交通运输企业以及农业生产合作社等所有生产单位，都结合讨论国家计划委员会提出的发展国民经济七年计划指标，研究自己单位实现计划的一些具体措施。虽然国家计划委员会提出的七年计划指标要在5月份这个全民性讨论结束后才可望公布，但在去年德国统一社会党第五次代表大会决议中和在这次代表大会以后公布的发展化学工业的纲领、农业发展七年计划和建筑业发展七年计划这三个文件中，已经规定了若干主要产品的指标。譬如：在工业方面：1965年德意志民主共和国工业总产值将为1960年的150％，其中化学工业产值将比1958年提高164％，塑料产量从现在每年每人平均七公斤增加到十六公斤；在农业方面：1965年谷物产量平均每公顷应达到三千到三千二百公斤；奶牛每一百公顷耕地平均饲养三十九头，每头平均年产奶三千五百公斤；猪每一百公顷耕地平均饲养一百三十头，与此相适应的饲料谷物从现在的年产五百万吨增加到六百三十万吨；在建筑业方面：作为主要建筑材料的水泥，1965年的产量将较现在增加111％，混凝土构件增至一千三百万吨，石棉混凝土板从现在的八十万平方公尺增加到六百五十万平方公尺。从这些指标中，人们可以相信，德意志民主共和国的七年计划指标一定会是一个鼓舞人心的纲领。
    德国同志认为，在目前社会主义同资本主义经济竞赛的决定性阶段，实现自己的七年计划将是德意志民主共和国对于现阶段的竞赛所做出的贡献。党和政府的领导人还强调实现这个计划的中心是速度。
    去年德国统一社会党第五次代表大会上决定，提高建设速度的关键是提高劳动生产率，认为在德意志民主共和国人口较少的情况下，希望用增加各个部门的劳动力来增加生产是有困难的。现在德意志民主共和国的工业正在沿着这个方向全面进行改建。
    工业的全面改建不只包括新建和扩建厂矿，装置和更新设备，采取新的技术，更重要的是从管理体制、生产集中程度和管理方法、工作方法上的改变，这里还包括了厂矿企业中科学家、工程师、技术人员和工人的关系的改变。
    早在去年9月，德意志民主共和国部长会议就完成了取消各个工业部，而根据各种不同的工业种类组成了许多“国营企业联合组织”，代替原有的各个工业部负责领导各个厂矿企业的工作，并将五百六十五个企业交给专区直接领导。过去，中央各工业部门都在首都，从中央到厂矿生产单位层次多，掌握情况、解决问题不能十分及时。建立“国营企业联合组织”后，根据企业分布情况，“国营企业联合组织”的所在地就不一定设在柏林。譬如，哈雷专区是德意志民主共和国的化学工业中心，化学工业的“国营企业联合组织”就设在这个专区。管理层次减少了，各相同的厂矿企业之间的联系密切了，干部便于面向群众了，结果自然是有利于生产的发展。由于“国营企业联合组织”和各生产厂矿企业联系紧密，对于国家计划机关掌握情况和进行领导也方便得多。在和德意志民主共和国的经济工作人员谈到1958年工业的空前发展时，人们都津津乐道地谈论工业管理体制的改变在这个大发展中所起的良好作用。
    今年在改变管理体制的基础上，又将旧的资本主义生产关系所遗留的分散的生产进行集中。党和政府提出了要在各个工业部门中实行“专业化、标准化、定型化”，准备通过这“三化”促进生产的进一步集中，更好地提高劳动生产率，从而加速建设的速度。“专业化、标准化、定型化”就成为当前德意志民主共和国工业改建的中心内容之一。
  所谓“专业化”，就是各厂的生产趋向专业。所谓“标准化”、“定型化”就是产品和工艺程序趋向统一标准和定型。德意志民主共和国同志认为，实现这“三化”，就更便于各厂矿企业的机械化和自动化，也将促使工业中的科学技术进一步得到发展，劳动生产率也将随之提高。德意志民主共和国同志认为，这“三化”是在资本主义生产关系下不可能彻底解决的任务，特别是标准化、定型化，在资本主义生产关系下是不可能做到的。
    今年2月间，国家计划委员会曾召开了一个专门讨论“标准化”的会议。会上检查了在一些部门中，还有由于旧的生产关系所遗留下来的一些产品品种过繁的不合理现象。譬如电熨斗，全国有二十一个工厂，品种达四十一种，家庭用缝纫机，全国四家工厂生产十四种；会议认为这样多的品种是不需要的。从生产方面说，品种过繁对于提高劳动生产率和降低成本是不利的；从消费方面说，在配件和修理工作上也常因品种过繁带来一些困难，特别在农业机械上。譬如，全国现有选择饲料机五十二种，而根据德意志民主共和国的情况，减少到二十七种便已够用了。农业机器和拖拉机制造“国营企业联合组织”总经理认为，这种品种过繁的现象，对于农业机械化并没有利；另一方面，通过定型化，将可以促进农业机械制造部门的专业化，从而提高它的生产能力，更好地供应农业机械。
    随着实行专业化、标准化和定型化，有些工厂还改组了车间的安排。过去旋床在一个车间，铣床又在另一个车间；现在根据工序把机器分组集中，组成生产网，只用很少投资就大大地提高了劳动生产率和降低了成本。国营索考尼维茨电热厂就是一例。这个工厂按工序把机器分组组成了六个生产网，同样规模的生产任务原来需要八百名工人，改组后只需要二百名工人就完成了。
    在工业改建中更引人注意的是工厂管理方法、工作方法的改变。党的组织批判了那种把改建计划当作少数设计专家在办公室里能解决的简单事务，而是当作一个复杂的政治任务，党组织提倡组织厂矿企业全体工程师、技术人员和工人共同讨论，并依赖他们来实现。柏林“十月七日”大型旋床制造厂就做出了很好的榜样。这个厂的党组织在起草工厂改建计划时，曾经组织了九个小组和六个分队，吸收了一千多名工程师、技术人员、老师傅、生产工人和管理人员共同参加起草工作，然后又把改建计划拿到各个车间的工会和生产会议上进行深入的讨论，最后在全厂的经济会议上讨论通过。这种广泛和深入的群众讨论，就为工厂的改建工作奠定了良好的基础。
    最近一个时期厂矿企业中发展起来的“社会主义工作集体”对于促进技术进步、提高劳动生产率也发生了良好影响。在统一社会党各级组织的倡导下，工程师、研究人员改变了过去和实践、和工人联系不够的状况而走向和工人、和生产密切结合。这种“社会主义工作集体”目前正在迅速发展，工作先进的哈雷专区已经建立起一千二百多个，大柏林市也有了三百多个。提倡工程师、研究人员和工人相结合，提倡理论和实践相结合，组织“社会主义工作集体”，就成为工业改建的另一个重要内容。
    目前，德意志民主共和国的工业改建工作已在开始，成千上万的德意志民主共和国的工人和其他劳动人民，正在集中力量投入这一复杂艰巨的工作。随着工业改建的实现，人们将看到早就享有国际声誉的德意志民主共和国的工业将以更高的水平出现于世界。
