Small Statistics

There are tens of thousands of types of commodities in our country, and the main packaging raw materials, such as wood, sacks, and cardboard, are needed in large quantities. Taking Shanghai's externally transferred commodities as an example, it is estimated that 340,000 cubic meters of wood will be needed for packaging this year; transporting this wood will require more than 8,000 train cars; 120 million various glass bottles are needed, and the production of these bottles will require about 1,000 tons of soda ash and more than 400 tons of borax. Tianjin ships out various pesticides and fertilizers each year, requiring 840,000 sacks. According to this year's second-quarter toothpaste production plan, the lead tubes for inner packaging will use 180 tons of lead.

    小统计
    我国商品种类成千上万，最主要的包装原材料如木材、麻袋、纸板，所需数量很大。以上海市外调商品来说，估计今年包装用的木材就需要三十四万立方公尺；调运这些木材就需要车皮八千多个；需要各种玻璃瓶子一亿二千万个，而生产这些瓶子还需要纯碱约一千吨、硼砂四百余吨。天津市每年运出的各种农药、化肥，仅麻袋就需要八十四万条。按今年第二季度牙膏生产计划，需要的内包装铅管将用铅一百八十吨。
