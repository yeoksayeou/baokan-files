An Ordinary Village in the Taihang Mountains
By Our Correspondents Hao Zhan'ao and Li Yuxiu

    Clear Spring Water
    The village of Yuanquan in Licheng is embraced by the majestic Taihang Mountains. In the village, a pool of clear spring water flowing from the foot of the Taihang Mountains has accumulated, hence the name Yuanquan (Spring Source) Village. During the arduous years of the Anti-Japanese War, it was one of the important industrial bases of the Anti-Japanese base areas in the Taihang Mountains. The spring water of Yuanquan is warm in winter and cool in summer. It is said that the paper made with it is durable and beautiful. This spring water, which made great contributions during the Anti-Japanese War, is now flowing ceaselessly to the fertile land, serving the great leap forward in agriculture with all its strength.
    In the past, Yuanquan Village was scarred by the cruel oppression of feudal forces and Japanese invaders, and the working people lived in extreme poverty. However, today's Yuanquan is a different Yuanquan. She has become very familiar, yet very strange. We say familiar because people will never forget her name and the spring water as clear as a mirror. We say strange because, except for the Martyrs' Memorial Pavilion standing in the village, which is the only sign of the war, what is presented to people is a thriving scene.
    Old Party Member Recalls the Past
    We arrived at the home of Comrade Yang Jifu, deputy secretary of the Party branch of the Yuanquan Management District.
    Yang Jifu, the deputy secretary of the Party branch, is the first Communist Party member in the village. He is not young, but he is very strong. He is a native of Yuanquan and has been a village cadre for twenty years. He is practically a living history book; without any hesitation, he told us about the changes in the village.
    "When I was a child, I remember Yuanquan Village as a poor village. Nine out of ten households worked as hired laborers for landlords and rich peasants.
    "In 1940, the Party organization was officially established in the village. The Party branch led the masses to organize mutual aid teams and cooperatives, reduce rent and interest, and abolish the landlords' exploitative practices. Later, land reform was carried out, and the landlords were completely defeated. Production was organized, and more grain was produced than in the past, and the lives of the peasants gradually improved.
    "But then again, difficulties are always encountered in doing work. For example, when the agricultural cooperatives were established in 1953, everyone knew that listening to the Party's call was correct, but some people wanted to wait and see before joining the cooperatives. Well, let them wait. Party members and members of the Communist Youth League took the lead and organized the first 32 households into elementary cooperatives. Two years later, people saw that agricultural cooperatives could produce more grain than mutual aid teams, so they all came to ask to join. The whole village was organized into an advanced cooperative. People want to go to higher places, and water flows to lower places. Who doesn't want to live a good life?" Old Yang smiled and continued.
    "Our Yuanquan Village has thick rocks and thin soil. In a bad year, one mu (0.16 acres) can only produce a hundred or so jin (about 50-60 kg) of grain. However, in the year the advanced cooperative was established, the average yield per mu was 320 jin, which was four or five times more than the pre-war output."
    What excited Old Yang the most was the establishment of the people's commune in 1958 and the great leap forward in agriculture. The average grain yield per mu was 449 jin. Moreover, forestry, animal husbandry, and sideline occupations have all developed greatly. The average income per person in the village was 100 yuan. Old Yang happily said: "I have lived in Yuanquan Village for fifty-five years, and this is the first year."

    Visiting a Commune Member's Home
    Eating in a canteen, we quickly became familiar with the commune members. One day, after dinner, we went to chat with a commune member named Li Yangchun.
    The two whitewashed rooms were brightly lit by electric lights. Li Yangchun and his wife were both at home. This sturdy peasant in his fifties, wearing a standard Licheng blue homespun cotton coat, neatly dressed, looked very capable. His wife was rushing to make new shoes for her husband and children so that they could wear them to the fair.
    While chatting, Li Yangchun said: "I worked as a hired laborer for the landlord for ten years. After the land reform, I was given land. Later, I joined the mutual aid team and the agricultural cooperative. The grain yield increased year by year, and life got better and better. Last year, when the commune was established, I worked 440 workdays alone." He continued non-stop, as if afraid of being interrupted, "Now, the children are all studying in school..."
    Speaking of this, the hostess, who had been silent, could no longer suppress her emotions. She said excitedly: "Talking about children makes me sad. You see, I'm not ashamed to say it, I gave birth to fourteen children, and now only four are left (one was given to Li Yangchun's brother). In the past, there was little to eat and drink, plus the Japanese devils' 'mopping-up operations,' even adults couldn't survive, let alone take care of children. In this way, ten children were starved and sick to death! Alas, it's a pity they were born too early. If they were born in this era, how good would it be."
    Li Yangchun looked at his wife approvingly and turned to us and said: "Not to mention anything else, the bedding is much better now. My family of five has a quilt for each person with some left over. The year before last, I bought a blanket, and last year I bought another one. In the past, we lived in this poor mountain village, what did we know about thermos bottles? Now we have thermos bottles, rubber boots... everything." He pointed to them one by one excitedly.
    "In terms of eating and drinking, you eat in the canteen, so of course you know. In the past, we had an old saying here, 'If you don't eat chaff for three days, you have no backbone!' In recent years, production has developed, and our food and drink have also improved step by step. Since the establishment of the commune, we don't eat chaff at all."
    According to the investigation by the Licheng County Committee of the Communist Party of China: In this village of 170 households, 34 households have built 144 new houses in the past three years; 70 households have renovated 263 houses. There are 63 households in the village with bank savings, the most of which is 490 yuan. Surplus grain households account for 62% of the total number of households. The whole village has purchased a total of 148 thermos bottles, 475 pairs of rubber shoes and rain boots...
    Yes, those heroes who created "elm wood cannons and landmines" in the Anti-Japanese War are now showing their skills again. Dong Fuhai once knocked down several enemies with his bare hands and seized a rifle, for which he was rewarded by the people's government. Today, he is meticulously raising silkworms. He and his partners plan to earn 3,000 yuan this year, which is four times more than last year.

    太行山上一个普通农村
    本报记者　郝占敖　李玉秀
    清澈的泉水
    黎城源泉村，被雄伟的太行山环抱着。村中，聚积着一池从太行山脚下流出来的清澈的泉水，源泉村就因此而得名。在艰苦的抗日战争的岁月里，它一直是太行山区抗日根据地的工业重地之一。源泉的泉水，冬暖夏凉。据说，用它造出来的纸，耐用、美观。这股抗日战争时期有过很大贡献的泉水，今天又川流不息地流向肥沃的土地上，全力为农业大跃进服务。
    过去，源泉村在封建势力和日本侵略者的残酷压榨下，遍体鳞伤，劳动人民过着极端贫困的生活。然而，今天的源泉却又是另外一个源泉了，她变得使人非常熟悉，却又十分生疏了。说她熟悉，是因为她的名字和那股清澈得像镜子一样的泉水，人们永远不会忘掉；说她生疏，是因为除了矗立在村中的烈士纪念亭唯一能标明战争的痕迹，展现在人们面前的，却是一片欣欣向荣的景象。
    老党员话当年
    我们到了源泉管理区党支部副书记杨积福同志家里。
    党支部副书记杨积福，是村子里头一个共产党员，年纪已经不小了，可是身体却非常结实。他是道地的源泉人，又是在本村整整工作了二十年的村干部。他简直是一部活历史；不经过任何思索就滔滔不绝地向我们叙述起这个村子的变化来了。
    “我还是一个小孩子的时候，就记得源泉村是一个穷村子，十户里边，有九户给地主富农当长工。
    “1940年，村里正式成立了党的组织。党支部领导群众组织起变工队、互助组，搞减租减息，取消了地主的‘黑骡打滚’、‘出门三声炮’的高利贷剥削。后来，又搞土地改革，彻底打垮了地主。组织起来生产，粮食比过去打得多了，农民的生活才一天天地好起来。
    “话又说回来了，做工作总是要碰到困难的。比方说吧，1953年成立农业社，谁也知道听党的号召不会错，可是，有些人还想看一看再入社。好吧，那就让他们等一等。党团员带头，先组织了三十二户的初级社。隔了两年，人们看见农业社就是能比互助组多打粮，都来要求入社了。全村就组织成一个高级社。人往高处走，水往低处流，谁还不愿过好生活？”老杨笑了笑，又说下去。
    “我们源泉村，石厚土薄，遇上个年景，一亩才能打百十斤粮食。可是，成立高级社的那一年，每亩平均打了三百二十斤，比起战前的产量增加了四、五倍。”
    使老杨感到最兴奋的是1958年人民公社成立和农业大跃进。粮食每亩平均产量四百四十九斤。而且，林业、牧业、副业都有很大的发展，全村每人平均收入一百元。老杨高兴地说：“我在源泉村活了五十五年，这是头一年。”在一个社员家里做客
    在一个食堂里吃饭，很快我们就跟社员们熟悉起来。一天，吃过晚饭，我们顺便去一户叫李阳春的社员家里聊天。
    两间粉刷得雪白的房间，被电灯光照得明晃晃的。这时候，李阳春两口子都在家里。这个身材粗壮的五十多岁的庄稼人，穿着一件标准的黎城蓝粗布棉袄，收拾得干干净净的，看起来很精干。妻子正在给丈夫和孩子们赶做新鞋，好让他们赶古会时候穿。
    在拉家常的时候，李阳春说：“以前，我给地主整整当了十年长工。土地改革，我分到了土地，以后组织互助组、农业社，粮食一年比一年打得多，生活一天比一天过得好了，去年成立公社，我一个人就做了四百四十个劳动日。”他仿佛怕别人打断他谈话似的，不停息地说下去，“现在，孩子们都在学校里念书……”
    谈到这里，一直保持沉默的女主人，再也压抑不住自己的感情了，她激动地说：“一说孩子就叫人伤心，你们看，我也不嫌羞，我生过十四个孩子，现在只留下四个（一个给了李阳春哥），以前少吃没喝，加上日本鬼子‘扫荡’，连大人也活不了，哪里还能顾得了孩子。就这样，饿的饿，病的病，把十个孩子活活给糟蹋了！唉，可惜他们生得太早了，要是在这个年头里生，该有多好。”
    李阳春赞同地看了看他的女人，又转向我们说：“不说别的，现在铺的、盖的都好了。我家五口人，每人一床被子还有剩余。前年，买了一块毯子，去年又买了一块。过去咱在这穷山沟，知道啥叫暖水瓶？现在暖水瓶、水鞋……样样都有。”他兴奋地一样样指给我们看。
    “在吃喝方面，你们在食堂吃饭，当然都知道了。以前，我们这里有句老话，叫‘三天不吃糠，肚里没主张！’这几年生产发展了，我们吃喝也一步步提高了。自成立公社以来，根本就不吃糠了。”
    根据中共黎城县委的调查：这个一百七十户人家的村子，近三年来，有三十四户新盖房子一百四十四间；七十户翻盖房子二百六十三间。全村有六十三户在银行存款，其中最多的存四百九十元。余粮户占总户数的62％。全村共购买暖水瓶一百四十八个，胶鞋、雨鞋四百七十五双……。
    是的，那些当年在抗日战争中创造“榆木炮带弹雷”的英雄们，今天又在大显本领。董富海曾经赤手空拳，打倒了几个敌人，夺得了一支步枪，因而受到了人民政府的奖励。今天，他又细致地养山蚕，他和他的伙伴们今年计划收入三千元，比去年要增加四倍。（附图片）
