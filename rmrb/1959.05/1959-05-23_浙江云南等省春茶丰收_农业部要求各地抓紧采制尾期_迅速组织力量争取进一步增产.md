Xinhua News Agency, 21st - As summer arrives, the tea mountains north and south of the Yangtze River are even greener, and the spring tea harvesting and production work in various places is nearing its end. The Ministry of Agriculture held a national tea telephone conference on May 12. According to reports from various provinces, Zhejiang, Yunnan, Hubei, Fujian and other provinces have all increased spring tea production compared to last year.

During this year's spring tea picking, the phenomenon of missed picking is still relatively common. The Ministry of Agriculture requires all localities to quickly organize forces, seize the tail end of the spring tea harvesting and production, and carry out a concentrated harvest and production to strive for further production increases. And strengthen the tea garden topdressing management work to create conditions for greater summer and autumn tea production.

Last winter and this spring, various localities did a better job of topdressing and cultivating tea gardens than in previous years; this year the temperature is also relatively high, and tea trees in Anhui, Zhejiang, Yunnan, and Hunan provinces generally sprouted earlier, with more buds, and the tree vigor is strong; these areas also advanced the spring tea picking time, which are important reasons for this year's bumper spring tea harvest. The quality of spring tea has also improved in many areas, such as Qimen black tea, where first-grade tea accounts for 84.2% this year.

This year's increase in spring tea production was achieved under the circumstance that the labor force invested in tea production was reduced compared to last year. This shows that: due to the attention and close attention of party and government leaders in various places to tea production, the efficiency of tea harvesting and production has been improved. This year, many people's communes in Hunan and Anhui have implemented measures such as contracting, production quotas, quality standards, and quantity standards for tea garden management and tea harvesting and processing; people's communes in Zhejiang, Sichuan and other provinces have implemented methods such as rewarding overproduction of tea picking and paying partial cash wages. All of these have played a significant role in improving the labor enthusiasm of farmers in harvesting and processing spring tea, and ensuring the increase in production and quality of spring tea. In order to improve labor productivity, various localities have promoted rapid double-handed picking methods, launched a movement to pick over 100 catties of tea per day, and many provinces have promoted many advanced tea-making tools, such as various hydraulic, animal-powered, and motorized tea-making machines.

    浙江云南等省春茶丰收
    农业部要求各地抓紧采制尾期
    迅速组织力量争取进一步增产
    新华社21日讯　夏季到来，长江南北的茶山更加碧绿，各地春茶采制工作临近尾期。农业部在5月12日召开了全国茶叶电话会议，根据各省汇报，浙江、云南、湖北、福建等省的春茶比去年都增产。
    在今年春茶采摘中，漏采的现象还比较普遍，农业部要求各地迅速组织力量，抓紧春茶采制尾期，突击采制，争取进一步增产。并加强茶园追肥管理工作为夏秋茶更多的增产创造条件。
    去冬今春各地对茶园追肥培土等管理工作作得比往年好；今年气温又比较高，安徽、浙江、云南、湖南四省茶树普遍发芽早、出芽多、树势生长健壮；这些地区又提早了春茶采摘的时间，这些是今年春茶丰收的重要原因。不少地区春茶质量也有提高，如祁门红茶今年一级茶占84.2％。
    今年春茶增产是在投入茶叶生产劳动力比去年减少的情况下取得的。这说明：由于各地党政领导对茶叶生产重视，抓得紧，茶叶采制的效率提高了。今年湖南、安徽许多人民公社的茶园管理和采茶、制茶都实行了包工、包产、定质、定量等措施；浙江、四川等省的人民公社实行了采茶超产奖励和支付部分现金工资等办法，所有这些对于提高农民采制春茶的劳动积极性，保证春茶增产和品质的提高都起了很大作用。为了提高劳动生产率，各地推广了双手快速z法，开展日采茶叶超百斤运动，许多省推广了许多先进的制茶工具，如各种水力、畜力、动力制茶机。
