　　Production as a Whole Linked Ring by Ring
　　Hunan's Coal and Iron Production Rises Through Counterpart Production

　　(Our newspaper, Changsha, 7th dispatch) Hunan Province's measure of adopting counterpart production between steel, iron, coal, and coke has played a significant role in guaranteeing the smooth completion of this year's provincial steel production tasks.

　　This year, Hunan Province's steel production has developed from small native furnaces to small modern furnace groups. The province has consolidated its original six hundred thousand scattered native blast furnaces into over one hundred steel and iron bases using modern methods; small coal mines have also been consolidated. At the same time, this year's steel production tasks not only require high output but also good quality, a wide variety, and low costs. Thus, the original counterpart relationships were no longer adequate. In order to adapt to the new situation, the Hunan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened a steel, iron, coal, and coke production conference in early March. The entire province made unified plans, broke down regional boundaries, and, starting from guaranteeing key priorities, adjusted the old steel, iron, coal, and coke counterpart relationships to establish new ones. At this conference, factories and mines, departments and departments, all signed counterpart contracts. In this way, the province's steel, iron, coal, and coke production was linked ring by ring into a whole, overcoming the unreasonable phenomena of the past in transportation and fuel supply, etc.

　　Since the counterpart conference, all of the province's one hundred-plus key steel bases have received sufficient fuel supplies. The Xianghua Iron Plant in Hengshan County, which had a good foundation in iron smelting, had been in a state of semi-shutdown at the beginning of this year due to a lack of fuel. Now, after several coal mines were designated to guarantee the plant's fuel supply, production quickly returned to normal. In the past, the Zijiang Iron Plant in Anhua County had two of its three small blast furnaces shut down due to insufficient fuel. Now, not only have all three furnaces been put into production, but they are also actively building two more small blast furnaces.

　　Because the province made unified plans and broke down regional boundaries, the transportation lines became more rational. In the past, the coal and coke used for steelmaking in Changsha City were supplied by Zhuzhou City, while Chaling and Youxian Counties, which are close to Zhuzhou City, had to transport them by truck from Ningxiang County in the western part of Changsha City, passing through Changsha before being transported to Chaling and Youxian. Now, after adjustment, the transportation distance has been shortened by two-thirds, saving a large amount of transportation costs and transportation capacity.

　　Since Hunan Province adopted counterpart production for steel, iron, coal, and coke, a new situation has emerged in production. The province's daily pig iron production level in March increased from 930 tons in February to 1,213 tons. The daily output of steel and steel products also increased by one to two times compared to February, and the quantity and quality of coal and coke have significantly improved. Now, the province's steel, iron, coal, and coke producing factories and mines are working hard and cleverly to strive to overfulfill the production tasks for the second quarter. (Gao Changren)

　　一环套一环结成生产整体
    湖南煤铁对口生产上升
    本报长沙7日电　湖南省采取钢、铁、煤、焦对口生产的办法，对保证今年全省钢铁生产任务的顺利完成，起了重大的作用。
    今年湖南省钢铁生产已由小土炉群发展到小洋炉群，全省由去年的六万多座分散的土高炉，整编为一百多个用洋法生产的钢铁基地；小煤窑也进行了整编。同时，今年的钢铁生产任务，不仅要求产量高，还要求质量好、品种多、成本低。这样，原有的对口关系，就不相适应了。为了适应新的情况，中共湖南省委在3月初召开了钢、铁、煤、焦生产会议，全省统一规划，打破区域界限，从保证重点出发，把旧的钢、铁、煤、焦对口关系加以调整，建立新的对口关系。在这次会议上，厂矿与厂矿、部门与部门，都签订了对口合同。这样全省的钢、铁、煤、焦生产就一环套一环地结成了一个整体，克服了过去运输和燃料供应等方面不合理的现象。
    对口会议以后，全省一百多个重点钢铁基点都得到了足够的燃料供应。炼铁基础较好的衡山县湘华铁厂，今年初一直因缺乏燃料，处于半停工状态。现在，确定了几个煤矿保证供应这个厂的燃料以后，生产迅速转入正常。安化县资江铁厂过去因燃料不足，三座小高炉停了两座。现在，不仅三座炉子全部投入生产，还积极兴建两座小高炉。
    由于全省作了统一的规划，打破了地区界线，使运输线路更加合理。过去，长沙市炼钢用的煤焦，都由株洲市供应，而靠近株洲市的茶陵、攸县，却要从长沙市西部的宁乡县用汽车运输，经过长沙再运到茶陵、攸县。现在，经过调整，运距就缩短了三分之二，节约了大批运费和运力。
    湖南省采取钢、铁、煤、焦生产对口以后，生产上出现了新的局面。全省3月份的生铁日产水平，就由2月份的九百三十吨上升到一千二百十三吨，钢和钢材的日产量，也比2月份增加一倍到两倍，煤和焦炭的产量质量都有显著的提高。现在，全省生产钢铁煤焦的厂矿企业，正在为争取超额完成第二季度的生产任务而苦干巧干。　（高长任）
