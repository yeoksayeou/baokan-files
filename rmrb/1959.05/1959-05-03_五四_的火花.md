    Sparks of the May Fourth Movement
    Xia Zhizhi

    I entered Hubei Women's Normal School in 1918. At that time, Hubei Province only had one women's normal school. The school's education for us was completely the old way, cultivating us to either become well-behaved elementary school teachers or virtuous wives and good mothers. We were not to concern ourselves with any social or political issues; we were completely ignorant. We were confined to the school all day, almost isolated from the outside world. Even when going home for vacation, our parents had to pick us up. In addition, the social atmosphere at that time was very feudal, and the warlords' armies often harassed young women on the streets, so we didn't dare to go out casually. At school, we studied classical Chinese prose, never came into contact with new culture, so our thinking was very closed. During the May Fourth Movement, we only knew that students in Beijing were making trouble, opposing Japan, and boycotting Japanese goods. Male students in Wuhan were also active, but we didn't know exactly what was going on.

    After the May Fourth Movement, the social atmosphere became more open, and male students, having accepted some new ideas during the May Fourth Movement, gradually influenced us female students.

    In the spring of 1921, Comrades Liu Zitong and Chen Tanqiu came to the Women's Normal School to teach. They promoted revolutionary principles to us, told us what the October Revolution and the May Fourth Movement were all about, and enlightened our minds. From 1921 to 1922, through them, we had contact with many comrades who led the workers' movement, such as Dong Biwu, Yun Daiying, and Li Qiushi, but not much interaction. We knew that they all believed in communism and that there was an organization called the Marxist Research Society, but we didn't understand the specific activities of this organization.

    Our propaganda activities among women, on the student side, were only at the Women's Normal School (at that time, Wuhan also had a girls' middle school, with only dozens of students and no Party strength). On the women worker's side, we had done some work among female workers in yarn factories and tobacco factories. At that time, Comrades Lin Yunan, Xu Lianghao, Xiang Dejiang (Xiang Ying), and Shi Yang mainly engaged in the workers' movement, and some also did student work concurrently. Comrades Dong Biwu, Chen Tanqiu, Liu Zitong, and Yun Daiying were all teachers who often did propaganda work among the students. This aroused the opposition of the old forces in society. The stubborn faction insulted them for "hating their fathers and being unfilial." I remember someone writing articles in the newspaper scolding them, saying, "The words of hating fathers and being unfilial are heartlessly advocated, and the ideas of equal distribution of property and shared wives are recklessly discussed." The reactionary forces used these "reasons" to attack the new forces. Teachers were dismissed and wanted, and students were expelled. The stubborn faction in the school threatened the school authorities with resignation and, together with the students' parents, demanded the dismissal of Comrade Liu Zitong. The principal of the Women's Normal School was originally an old scholar. Because the May Fourth New Culture Movement advocated vernacular Chinese, he hired a few teachers who lectured on new literature, which could be considered as catering to the trend. Under the encirclement of the old forces, in the spring of 1922, he dismissed Comrade Liu Zitong. Because of this, the students of the Women's Normal School launched a great storm. Originally, after Comrade Liu Zitong and others came to the school, they brought us many new ideas. We were already dissatisfied with the stubborn faction in the school and some unreasonable phenomena. Now that the school authorities dismissed Comrade Liu Zitong for no reason, it aroused great indignation among us. We held a strike to protest.

    During the strike, more than a dozen progressive students from our Women's Normal School organized a "Women's Reading Club" and self-studied some progressive books. At the same time, we invited Comrades Chen Tanqiu, Huang Fusheng, and others to give us speeches, mainly on the issue of women's liberation. They introduced us to the path of women's liberation and criticized the "women's suffrage movement" engaged in by a small number of upper-class women at that time from a Marxist point of view. In addition, they also talked about Marxism.

    At the same time as the Women's Normal School strike, the Wuhan Foreign Language College was also having a strike, which was very fierce. The Wuhan Student Union issued a call, requesting all schools above the secondary level to support the struggle of the Women's Normal School and the Foreign Language College students by going on strike.

    At that time, the Wuhan student movement, with Zhonghua University as its base, was very active at the Foreign Language College and several middle schools.

    In 1922, seven or eight students from our Women's Normal School were absorbed into the Wuhan Youth League branch as members. In winter, five of us were expelled for participating in the student movement. After that, the League organization sent us to the yarn factory to help do some work. Soon, the "February 7th" strike broke out. The Party and the League were busy with the labor movement, and we helped in the "Wuhan News Agency" run by the Party, sending news稿s (mimeographed) of the strike to various newspapers. After "February 7th," we couldn't stay in Wuhan, so we ran to Beijing.

    “五四”的火花
    夏之栩
    我在1918年进湖北女子师范，当时，湖北省只有这样一个女子师范。学校对我们的教育，完全是旧的一套，培养我们或者成为一个安分守己的小学教员，或者当个贤妻良母。什么社会问题、政治问题，都不要我们过问，我们是毫无所知。我们整天被关在学校里，几乎和外界隔绝。连放假回家，也得由家长来接。加上当时社会风气很封建，军阀的军队，又往往在街上随便调戏青年妇女，我们也不敢随便上街。在学校里，读的是文言骈体文，从来没有接触过新文化，因此思想很闭塞，“五四”运动当时，我们只知道北京学生闹学潮，反对日本，抵制日货，武汉的男学生也有活动，但我们不知道究竟是怎么一回事。
    “五四”以后，社会风气开通了一些，加上男学生在“五四”运动中，接受了一些新思想，这些新思想，逐渐影响到我们女学生。
    1921年春，刘子通、陈潭秋等同志先后来到女师教书。他们向我们宣传革命的道理，告诉我们十月革命和“五四”运动是怎么一回事，使我们的思想得到启蒙。1921年—1922年间，通过他们，我们和董必武、恽代英、李求实等许多领导工人运动的同志都有过接触，但来往不多。我们知道他们都是信仰共产主义的，也知道有马克思主义研究会的组织，但对这个组织的具体活动情况不了解。
    我们在妇女中的宣传活动，在学生方面，就只有女师（当时武汉还有一个女子中学，只有数十人，也没有党的力量），女工方面，曾向纱厂和烟厂的女工进行过一些工作。当时林育南、许良昊、项德降（项英）、施洋等同志，主要搞工人运动，有的也兼做学生工作。董必武、陈潭秋、刘子通、恽代英等同志都是教员，经常向学生做宣传工作。这就引起社会上旧势力的反对，顽固派侮辱他们“仇父非孝”，记得有人写文章在报纸上骂他们说：“仇父非孝之言，忍心倡导，均产共妻之说，信口訾谈。”反动势力就拿这些“理由”打击新的力量。教员被解聘被通缉，学生被开除。学校里的顽固派，以辞职威胁校方，并联合学生家长，要求解聘刘子通同志。女师校长，本来是个旧学派，因“五四”新文化运动提倡白话文，请几个讲新文学的教员，也算是迎合潮流，他在旧势力的包围之下，于1922年春，解聘刘子通同志。为这件事，女师学生掀起了一次大风潮。原来从刘子通同志等来校以后，把许多新思想带给我们，我们对于学校里的顽固派，和一些不合理的现象已有不满，现在校方无理解聘刘子通同志，就引起我们很大的愤慨。举行罢课抗议。
    在罢课期间，我们女师的十多个进步同学，组织了一个“妇女读书会”，自学一些进步书籍。同时，请陈潭秋、黄负生等同志给我们讲话，主要讲妇女解放问题，他们曾向我们介绍妇女解放的道路，用马克思主义观点批判当时少数上层妇女所从事的“妇女参政运动”，此外，也讲马克思主义。
    和女师学潮同时，武汉外国语专门学校也闹学潮，闹得很凶，武汉学联曾发出号召，要求中等以上各校用罢课来支援女师和外专学生的斗争。
    当时武汉学生运动，以中华大学为大本营，外国语专门学校和几个中学都很活跃。
    1922年我们七八个女师的学生被武汉青年团支部吸收为团员。冬天，我们五个人因学生运动被开除。此后，团的组织曾派我们到纱厂去帮助做一些工作。不久，爆发“二七”罢工运动，党和团都忙着搞工运，我们在党办的“武汉通讯社”帮助工作，向各报纸发罢工消息的新闻稿（油印的），“二七”后，我们在武汉待不下去，便跑到北京来了。
