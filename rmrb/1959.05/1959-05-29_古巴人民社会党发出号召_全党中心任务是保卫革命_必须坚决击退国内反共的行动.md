Xinhua News Agency, Havana, 27th -- The People's Socialist Party of Cuba, at its National Committee plenary session on the 27th, passed a resolution defining the central task of the entire party at present as defending the revolution and pushing it forward.

The People's Socialist Party's resolution on the current situation and tasks pointed out that the passage of the Land Reform Law is an extremely important step forward for the Cuban revolution. It will change the semi-colonial economic structure and establish an independent and progressive economic structure. It will raise the people's living standards and eliminate single-product economies and unemployment. The plenary session called on party members and the masses to support this law without reservation and to defend it from attacks by imperialists, large landowners, and other reactionaries.

The resolution said that imperialists, large landowners, and Batista elements affected by the Land Reform Law are waging a broad and acute struggle against this law. Counter-revolutionary conspiracies are currently developing, Cuban sugar quotas are being threatened in the U.S. market, Trujillo and other tyrants are carrying out armed provocations, and newspapers of large landowners, Batista elements, and other elements are openly engaging in reactionary propaganda. Faced with this situation, the National Committee affirmed that strengthening the unity of all revolutionary forces is more important than ever.

The resolution said that from this point of view, the plenary session believes that attacking any revolutionary organization, violating democratic principles within organizations such as trade unions, developing factional struggles within organizations, and tolerating and concealing the actions of Mujal splinter groups are inappropriate.

The resolution strongly condemned anti-communist actions and believes that such actions must be resolutely repelled. The resolution pointed out that reactionaries are attempting to oppose all fundamental measures of the revolution under the guise of anti-communism. They call everyone who has a revolutionary, anti-imperialist, and progressive stance a communist. They call all laws and measures that are detrimental to vested interest groups communist. The resolution emphasized that making concessions to anti-communism weakens the revolution. Making anti-communist statements cannot weaken or repel the attacks of the enemies of the revolution, but will help and strengthen such attacks. Some people among the revolutionary forces disagree with the ideas and principles of the communists. These issues can be discussed within the revolution, but should not weaken the unity of the revolution or hinder necessary cooperation. The purpose of this cooperation is to defend the revolution and implement measures that revolutionaries with various different ideas and tendencies all agree on.

The resolution finally called on the fraternal people of Latin American countries to intensify and strengthen their support for the Cuban revolution.

    古巴人民社会党发出号召
    全党中心任务是保卫革命
    必须坚决击退国内反共的行动
    新华社哈瓦那27日电　古巴人民社会党在27日的全国委员会全体会议上通过决议，确定以保卫革命并使其向前发展作为全党当前的中心任务。
    人民社会党关于目前形势和任务的决议指出，土地改革法的通过是古巴革命向前迈出的极端重要的一步，它将改变半殖民地的经济结构，建立起独立和进步的经济结构；它将提高人民的生活水平和消除单一生产及失业现象。全会号召党员和群众无限制地支持这个法律，保卫它不受帝国主义者、大庄园主和其他反动分子的攻击。
    决议说，受到土地改革法影响的帝国主义分子、大庄园主和巴蒂斯塔分子正在对这项法律展开广泛而尖锐的斗争。目前反革命阴谋在发展，美国市场上古巴糖的定额受着威胁，特鲁希略和其他暴君进行着武装挑衅，大庄园主、巴蒂斯塔分子和其他分子的报刊公开地进行反动宣传。面对着这种局势，全国委员会确认加强一切革命力量的团结比以往任何时候更为重要。
    决议说，从这种观点出发，全会认为对任何一个革命组织进行攻击、违背工会等等组织内部的民主原则、发展各组织中的派别斗争以及容忍和掩藏穆哈尔分裂分子的作法都是不适当的。
    决议强烈地谴责反共的行动，并且认为必须坚决地击退这种行动。决议指出，反动派企图在反共的名目下反对革命的一切根本措施。他们把一切具有革命、反帝国主义和进步立场的人都叫做共产党人。他们把一切有害于既得利益集团的法律和措施都称为共产党的。决议强调指出，向反共让步就是削弱革命。发表反共言论不能削弱也不能击退革命敌人的进攻，而会帮助和加强这种进攻。革命力量当中有些人不同意共产党人的思想和原则，这些问题可以在革命内部进行讨论，但是不应该削弱革命的团结和妨碍必要的合作。这种合作的目的是保卫革命和推行我们具有各种不同思想和倾向的革命者都一致同意的措施。
    决议最后要求拉丁美洲各国兄弟人民加紧和加强对古巴革命的支援。
