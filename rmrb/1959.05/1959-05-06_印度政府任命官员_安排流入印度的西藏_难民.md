Xinhua News Agency, May 5th, New Delhi Dispatch: According to the Press Trust of India, the Indian government has appointed Nanda, an official from the Ministry of External Affairs, to be responsible for arranging for the so-called "refugees" flowing into India from Tibet. Nanda already departed for Tezpur in Assam on May 1st.

According to an Associated Press dispatch from New Delhi on May 1st, Nanda's current task is to "investigate the scale of the refugee problem, understand how much housing is needed, and probably decide whether and when to allow journalists to meet with the refugees."

The dispatch said that the Indian "government is working overtime there (in Assam) to complete the construction of a large camp for the refugees."

According to Indian official sources, the number of these "refugees" has reached 7,000 as of May 1st. These sources say that some more people may enter India in the following days.

The Press Trust of India reported from Tezpur on May 2nd that "(Indian) authorities are establishing camps for refugees in Misamari (northeast of Tezpur, Assam)." The report said that "the State Police Bureau has also established a radio station in Misamari."

The May 2nd "Indian Express" said that the so-called "Central Relief Committee for Tibetans," chaired by Acharya Kripalani, Chairman of the Praja Socialist Party, is responsible for "handling" the "aid" to the "refugees." The Indian Red Cross, through its organization in Assam, also provided "aid" to the "refugees." The "Times of India" said on May 5th that Mrs. Sucheta Kripalani, General Secretary of the Congress Party, went to Tezpur on the evening of May 4th to "inspect the arrangements made there for Tibetan refugees." She will also organize an "relief committee" in Assam.

The "Hindustan Standard" reported on May 3rd, "The Praja Socialist Party National Committee, recently established to help Tibetan refugees in India, held a meeting in New Delhi on Saturday (May 2nd) to discuss relief and aid work." Representatives of the Indian Red Cross and Mrs. Kripalani, General Secretary of the All-India Congress Committee, attended the meeting.

    印度政府任命官员
    安排流入印度的西藏“难民”
    新华社5日讯　新德里消息：据印度报业托辣斯报道，印度政府已经任命外交部官员南达负责安排从西藏流入印度的所谓“难民”。南达已经于5月1日动身前往阿萨姆邦的提斯浦尔。
    据5月1日美联社发自新德里的消息，南达当前的任务是“调查难民问题的规模，了解需要多少住房，大概还要决定是否准许和何时准许记者会见难民。”
    这条消息说，印度“政府正在那里（阿萨姆邦）加班工作以完成为难民们修建的一个大营地的工作。”
    据印度官方人士宣布，迄5月1日为止，这些“难民”的人数已达到七千人。这些人士说，在这以后几天内可能还有一些人进入印度。
    印度报业托辣斯5月2日自提斯浦尔报道，“（印度）当局正在米萨马里（阿萨姆邦提斯浦尔东北）为难民建立营地。”报道说，“邦警察局还在米萨马里建立了无线电台。”
    5月2日的“印度快报”说，由人民社会党主席阿恰里亚·克里帕拉尼担任主席的所谓“中央救济西藏人委员会”正在负责“处理”给“难民”的“援助”。印度红十字会通过它在阿萨姆的机构也为“难民”提供了“援助”。“印度时报”5月5日说，国大党总书记苏契塔·克里帕拉尼夫人已于5月4日晚上前往提斯浦尔去“视察那里为西藏难民所作的安排”。她还将组织阿萨姆邦的“救济委员会”。
    5月3日“印度斯坦旗报”报道，“不久前成立的帮助在印度的西藏难民的人民社会党民族委员会星期六（5月2日）在新德里举行会议，讨论了救济和援助工作的问题。”印度红十字会的代表和印度国大党全国委员会总书记克里帕拉尼夫人出席了这个会议。
