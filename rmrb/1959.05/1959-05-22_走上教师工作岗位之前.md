　　In a few months, we will be leaving the capital, leaving our beloved alma mater. The future teaching life is already tugging at our heartstrings. We imagine how we will formally step onto the podium for the first time; how we will labor together with students in the fields...

　　When I think of the beautiful and lofty word "teacher," the scenes of running schools in factories and rural areas, and the internships in middle schools, appear before our eyes.

　　Once, classmate Zeng Tian taught Wang Houjian's "The Story of Grain" at the Experimental Middle School. When she talked about the heroic sacrifice of the young Red Seventh soldier, many students couldn't help but shed tears. After class, students confided in the teacher about their aspirations for revolution. When students looked at us with inquisitive eyes and asked all sorts of questions, those pure and progressive demands, and strong desires for knowledge, powerfully inspired and spurred us on.

　　In a few months, we will be living with them. Our ideological transformation and learning have never been so closely linked to tomorrow's work as they are now. For us, every minute is as precious as gold. Before "May Day," we held an organizational life session with the theme of "Learning from Revolutionary Predecessors, Becoming Red Graduates"; recently, we will combine the study of "On Contradiction" in the philosophy class to discuss why we should establish the idea of continuous revolution. Applications to join the Party are being submitted to the Party branch one after another. In the evening, we gather in twos and threes under the green shade of the campus, talking intimately, and offering each other earnest criticisms: "Why do you always get emotional over trivial matters in life? You should be more open-minded and put the Party's demands on us first"; "Why are you always so arrogant when listening to other people's opinions?" We want to become people's teachers who are expected by the Party and the people, and seize every opportunity to train and transform ourselves.

　　Just like treating daughters who are about to get married, the teachers are busier than usual. In order to enable us to learn more knowledge in the shortest possible time, they often prepare lessons until late at night. At the three-way combination meeting held by the Party branch, the teachers of the modern literature group more carefully understood the students' opinions on teaching; and put forward strict criticisms of the phenomenon that some students do not carefully study the lecture notes due to complacency. At the same time, they also taught us that teachers are not only disseminators of culture, but also builders of science. They must always explore the latest achievements, not be satisfied with a smattering of knowledge, and set lofty aspirations. We must cherish these words and keep them in mind at all times.

　　The Party has repeatedly taught us that not reading and not seeking thorough understanding is the worst fault. Now, the atmosphere of diligent reading is one of the new features of our collective. When studying Tolstoy's "Resurrection," it is natural for everyone to link it to the question of "whether the world outlook contradicts the creative method." For this reason, students have borrowed almost all the commentaries on Tolstoy in the library; they have also collected the fallacies of domestic and foreign revisionists on this issue, and made dozens of cards; as for Lenin's articles on Tolstoy, they are read word by word, with various symbols drawn on them, and densely written small characters between the lines are proof of this. Why is this? One student put it well: "In the past, revisionists, in order to deny the class nature of literature and deny the ideological transformation of writers, said that the world outlook contradicted the creative method, and always used Tolstoy as a shield. We were once confused by it. Can we let our future students be fooled again!"

　　We are about to leave our alma mater. What can we leave as a souvenir? We fertilize the tomatoes and cabbages in the vegetable garden, water the sunflowers planted during the school's Party Congress, and prepare to complete the last scientific research task in our university stage - revising the first draft of the "History of Chinese Folk Literature." At present, we are using our spare time to collect materials; carefully study various comments on the history of folk literature, and prepare to clarify the scope and status of folk literature, as well as its relationship with writers' literature, etc., first arming ourselves theoretically, and waiting to concentrate on revision after the course is over.

　　Speaking of the history of folk literature, we all say: "It is the product of the great revolution in education." Last year, during the great revolution in education, students who participated in compiling the "History of Chinese Literature" had the idea of compiling a history of Chinese folk literature because they came into contact with more creations of the working people themselves. Then, we ate, lived, and worked with the peasants of Yongfengtun Township and the May 1st Cooperative. In just one month, we learned some labor skills, but more importantly, we understood the truth that poems come from the labor front. When we said goodbye to the peasants with tears of reluctance, we secretly made up our minds: to be good children of the working people, and to dedicate our strength to the intellectualization of workers and peasants. We returned to school with the fragrance of soil. In this time of the Great Leap Forward, how can we spend a leisurely summer vacation? We must let the folk literature that was trampled underfoot by the ruling class shine brightly, "Yes!" So we immediately plunged into the battle of compiling the "History of Chinese Folk Literature." Writing books and making statements was something we never dared to think about in the past. At this time, the Party's call for "liberating the mind" boosted our courage to advance towards the fortress of science. When encountering difficulties, the soaring enthusiasm of the working people gave us powerful encouragement. With the support of all parties, we used collective wisdom to write the first draft of the "History of Chinese Folk Literature." In the past year, combined with learning, under the leadership of the Party, and under the guidance of teachers, our fourth grade has also held six scientific report meetings. Through scientific research, we have not only expanded our knowledge field, but also cultivated independent working ability, which should be so important for a people's teacher!

　　Four years, the days are not long, but it makes us unforgettable for life. In the past four years, we have experienced the socialist revolution in politics and ideology, we have participated in the thrilling anti-Rightist struggle, and we have been tempered by the flames of "Double Opposition"; in the great revolution in education, we have washed away the dirt of individualism with the sweat of labor... Here, there is so much hard work of the Party! When we are advancing triumphantly and confidently towards the future life, how can we not think of the Party's teachings.

　　Where to go after graduation? Huang Jiancheng, a student from the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, hopes to return to his hometown. Four years ago, when he left his hometown to study in Beijing, the villagers sent him forty miles. Before parting, they repeatedly told him: "You are the first college student in our village. Listen to Chairman Mao's words and come back after you have learned well!" Recently, a large reservoir has been built in their hometown. He said excitedly: "I can teach students under electric lights in the future!"

　　Who young people don't want to fly far? What attracts us most is the border. The special pages of each region introduced by the People's Daily every week are the most attractive to us. Dear Party, we are the first batch of university graduates to implement the Party's education policy. We are young people who have grown up beside the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao. Please issue a call! Our resounding answer is: The needs of the motherland are our volunteers! Our resounding answer is: "We must spend our lives vigorously and promisingly for the Party's education cause."

    走上教师工作岗位之前
    北京师范大学中文系四年级学生
    还有几个月就要离开首都，离开亲爱的母校了。未来的教师生活已经在扣动着我们的心弦，我们想像着怎样第一次正式走上讲台；如何与学生共同劳动在田野上……
    想起“教师”这个美丽崇高的字眼，在工厂、农村办学，在中学实习时的情景就呈现在我们眼前。
    有一次曾恬同学在实验中学教王厚坚写的“粮食的故事”，当她讲到年幼的红七英勇牺牲的时候，好多同学忍不住流出了眼泪，课后，一个个的学生向老师倾吐自己向往革命的理想。当学生每次用探索的眼光对着我们发出种种问题的时候，那些纯真的进步要求，强烈的求知欲望，有力地激励着我们，鞭策着我们。
    再有几个月就要与他们生活在一起了。我们的思想改造和学习从来没有像现在这样与明天的工作紧密地联系起来，对我们来说，每一分钟都像黄金似的宝贵。“五一”前夕，我们以“向革命前辈学习，做红色毕业生”为题过了组织生活；最近又将结合哲学课“矛盾论”的学习，讨论为什么要树立不断革命思想。入党申请书一份又一份地交到党支部。傍晚，我们三三两两地在校园的绿荫下促膝交谈着，相互提出恳切的批评：“你干吗老为生活琐事闹情绪呢？胸襟要开阔一点，把党对我们的要求放在第一位”；“你为什么倾听别人意见时态度总是不谦虚呢？”我们要成为党和人民期望的人民教师，抓紧一切机会，锻炼改造自己。
    就像对待要出嫁的女儿一样，老师比往常更忙碌了。为使我们在最短期间学到更多知识，经常备课到深夜，在党支部召开的三结合会议上，现代文学组的教师们更细致地了解了同学们对于教学的意见；对于部分同学由于自满情绪不认真钻研讲稿的现象提出了严格的批评。同时还教导我们：教师不但是文化的传播者，也应该是科学的建设者，要时刻探讨最新的成就，不要满足于一知半解，要立下宏伟的志向。这些话，我们要好好珍惜，时刻牢记在心里。
    党一再教导我们，不读书，不好求甚解是再坏也不过的毛病。现在，刻苦读书的风气已是我们集体的新气象之一。在学习托尔斯泰的“复活”的时候，很自然的，大家就联系到“世界观是否与创作方法矛盾”的问题，为了这，同学们把图书馆里有关托尔斯泰的评论差不多都借光了；还搜集了国内外修正主义者在这问题上的谬论，做了几十张卡片；至于列宁论托尔斯泰的文章更是逐字逐句地阅读，在那上面画着的各种各样的符号，字里行间写着密密麻麻的小字便是证明。为什么这样？一个同学说得好：“过去修正主义者为了否定文学的阶级性，否定作家的思想改造，说什么世界观与创作方法矛盾，总拿托尔斯泰做挡箭牌，我们曾被它弄得头昏脑胀过，难道还能让我们将来的学生再上当吗！”
    就要离开母校了，用什么来留作纪念呢？我们在菜园里给西红柿和洋白菜施肥，给在校党代会召开时种下的向日葵浇水，还准备着完成大学阶段最后一项科学研究任务——修改“中国民间文学史”初稿。目前，我们利用课余时间搜集资料；仔细研究对民间文学史的各种评论，并准备弄清民间文学的范围、地位以及它与作家文学的关系等问题，先在理论上武装自己，以待课程结束后集中精力修改。
    提起民间文学史，我们都说：“它是教育大革命的产儿”。去年，教育大革命的时候，参加编写“中国文学史”的同学由于接触到更多的劳动人民自己的创作，便有了编写中国民间文学史的想法。接着，我们到永丰屯乡与五一社农民同吃、同住、同劳动，短短的一个月，我们学习到一些劳动的技能，然而更重要的还是懂得了劳动战线出诗章的道理。当我们流着惜别眼泪与农民告别的时候，都暗暗地下了决心：做劳动人民的好儿女，一定要为工农知识化献出自己的力量。我们带着泥土的芳香回到了学校。在这全民大跃进的时候，怎能过一个闲适的暑假呢？一定要让被统治阶级踩在脚底下的民间文学大放异彩，“对！”于是我们立即投到编写中国民间文学史的战斗中去。著书立说，这是我们过去想也不敢想的事，这时党的“解放思想”的号召，鼓起了我们向科学堡垒进军的勇气。在遇到困难时，劳动人民的冲天干劲给我们有力的鼓舞。我们在各方面的支持下用集体智慧，写出了“中国民间文学史”初稿。一年来，结合学习，在党的领导下，在教师的指导下，我们四年级还开过六次科学报告会。通过科学研究不但扩大了知识领域，而且培养了独立工作能力，这对一个人民教师来说该是多么重要啊！
    四年，日子并不算长，然而它却使我们终身难忘。四年中我们经历了政治、思想上的社会主义革命，我们参加了惊心动魄的反右派斗争，受到了“双反”烈火的冶炼；在教育大革命中，我们用劳动的汗水洗刷着个人主义的肮脏……这里，有着党的多少心血啊！当我们高歌猛进、满怀信心地走上未来的生活的时候，怎么能不想起党的教言。
    毕业后到那里去呢？从广西僮族自治区来的黄建成同学希望回到他的家乡。四年前，当他离开故乡来北京学习的时候，乡亲们一直送了他四十里路，临别还一再嘱咐：“你是咱们村第一个大学生，好好听毛主席的话，学好后回来啊！”最近，他们家乡已经修了个大水库。他兴奋地说：“以后我可在电灯下面教学生了！”
    年青人谁不想远走高飞呢？最使我们向往的还是边疆。人民日报每周介绍的各地区专页最是吸引我们。亲爱的党，我们是贯彻党的教育方针后第一批大学毕业生，我们是在党中央和毛主席身旁长大的年青人，请您发出召唤吧！我们响亮的回答：祖国的需要就是我们的志愿！我们响亮的回答是：“要为党的教育事业奋发有为地度过一生。”
