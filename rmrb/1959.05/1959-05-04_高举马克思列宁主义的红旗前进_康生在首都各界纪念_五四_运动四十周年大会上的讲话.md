Comrades:

    It has been forty years since the May Fourth Movement. In these forty years, our motherland has undergone tremendous changes. At the time of the May Fourth Movement, the Chinese people lived under the cruel exploitation and oppression of imperialism and feudalism. That dark era is gone forever. Under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, our country has not only completely accomplished the democratic revolution but has also achieved great victories in the socialist revolution and socialist construction. Our socialist motherland is like the rising sun appearing on the eastern horizon.

    The May Fourth Movement took place under the influence of the great October Socialist Revolution. It was the beginning of China's new democratic revolution led by the proletariat. After the May Fourth Movement, the Chinese workers' movement developed rapidly, Marxism-Leninism was widely disseminated in China, and the Communist Party of China was officially established in 1921. The May Fourth Movement was the beginning of the new cultural movement led by the Chinese proletariat. Comrade Mao Zedong pointed out that "after the May Fourth Movement, China produced a completely new force in culture; that is, the communist ideology led by the Chinese Communists, namely, the communist world outlook and theory of social revolution." The May Fourth Movement opened up the only correct revolutionary road of intellectuals integrating with workers and peasants. Therefore, the May Fourth Movement is of utmost importance to the historical development of our country in the past forty years.

    To commemorate the May Fourth Movement, we must launch a broad movement to study Marxist-Leninist theory. Chairman Mao Zedong, the great leader of all ethnic groups in our country, is the most outstanding representative of Marxist-Leninist theory in our country. The continuous great victories of the Chinese revolution and construction are the result of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, adhering to the combination of Marxist-Leninist theory and China's specific reality. Our socialist construction has achieved extremely great victories on all fronts. In particular, since 1958, under the brilliant illumination of the Party's General Line for socialist construction, our industrial and agricultural production has achieved a great leap forward, and our rural people's commune movement has also achieved extremely great victories. The more our cause develops, the more we need to strengthen the theoretical research and guidance of Marxism-Leninism on new things. We must study theory systematically and in connection with reality. We must advocate reading diligently. In order to develop theoretical research in the social sciences, we must strengthen leadership, cultivate a contingent of theoretical workers, encourage social science workers to conduct systematic and long-term efforts under the guidance of Marxism-Leninism, fully grasp relevant data, engage in independent and creative research, and, on the basis of serving socialism, implement the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom, let a hundred schools of thought contend." We must advocate the study of dialectical materialism, oppose idealism, and oppose metaphysics. Any dogmatic tendency divorced from reality is wrong, and any empirical tendency that belittles theory is also wrong. We must maintain the purity of Marxism-Leninism, continue to smash the fallacies of Yugoslav modern revisionism and other modern revisionisms, and thoroughly eliminate its bad influence.

    To commemorate the May Fourth Movement, we must resolutely implement the policy of intellectualizing workers and peasants and making intellectuals laborers. Comrade Mao Zedong said, "The final demarcation of revolutionary, non-revolutionary, or counter-revolutionary intellectuals depends on whether they are willing and implement integration with the workers and peasants." Now, many of the old intellectuals in our country not only sincerely want to accept the leadership of the Party and serve socialist construction but also begin to go deep among the workers and peasants, participate in the struggle, participate in productive labor, and transform themselves into intellectuals of the working class. We must continue to implement the Party's education policy, so that education serves the politics of the working class and is combined with productive labor. In order to rapidly transform our country into a great socialist country with modern industry, modern agriculture, and modern science and culture, we must cultivate a vast contingent of working-class intellectuals who are both red and expert, especially encouraging the vast number of young people to strengthen self-transformation, march towards science, master various scientific knowledge, and strive to climb the peaks of science. We must constantly improve the cultural, scientific, and technological level of the broad masses of workers and peasants and make unremitting efforts to gradually eliminate the boundaries between mental and physical labor.

    To commemorate the May Fourth Movement, we must carry forward the thoroughly revolutionary spirit of the May Fourth Movement. The history of our country since the May Fourth Movement proves that to overthrow the rule of imperialism and feudalism and to realize the lofty ideals of socialism, we must unite all forces that can be united under the leadership of the proletariat and the Communist Party to wage a resolute struggle against the enemies of the revolution. All paths of reform and compromise are unworkable. The history since the May Fourth Movement also tells us that society is constantly advancing, and the revolution must also continuously develop from a lower stage to a higher stage. At the time of the May Fourth Movement, the task of the Chinese revolution was to oppose imperialism and feudal forces. Therefore, we must resolutely oppose the comprador bourgeoisie and the landlord class ideology. Our current task is to thoroughly complete the socialist revolution and achieve the victory of socialist construction. Therefore, we must resolutely oppose bourgeois ideology, establish proletarian ideology, oppose individualist ideology, and establish collectivist ideology. In order not to be thrown behind the times by the wheel of history, people must constantly improve their awareness, transform their thinking, always stand at the forefront of the times, and always act as thorough revolutionaries.

    Comrades! In the forty years since the May Fourth Movement, the struggle of our people has achieved extremely brilliant victories. Now, the people of the whole country are making arduous efforts to strive for a better tomorrow. We must go all out, rely on the masses, overcome various difficulties, and strive to fulfill and overfulfill the 1959 industrial and agricultural production plan. We must thoroughly eliminate the rebellion of pro-imperialist elements in Tibet and smash the conspiracy of imperialists and foreign interventionists to interfere in our internal affairs, support the rebels, and undermine our national unity! Let us, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao Zedong, hold high the red banner of Marxism-Leninism and bravely advance!

    高举马克思列宁主义的红旗前进
    康生在首都各界纪念“五四”运动四十周年大会上的讲话同志们：
    五四运动发生到现在，已经四十年了。在这四十年里，我们祖国经历了一个天翻地复的大变化。在五四运动发生的当时，中国人民生活在帝国主义和封建主义残酷的剥削和压迫之下。这个黑暗的时代已经一去不复返了。我国在中国共产党的领导下，现在不仅已经彻底地完成了民主主义革命，并且取得了社会主义革命和社会主义建设的伟大胜利。我们的社会主义祖国，正像初升的太阳出现在东方的地平线上。
    五四运动是在伟大的十月社会主义革命的影响下发生的，它是我国无产阶级领导的新民主主义革命的开始。五四运动以后，中国工人运动有了迅速的发展，马克思列宁主义在中国得到了广泛传播，到1921年中国共产党就正式成立了。五四运动是中国无产阶级领导的新文化运动的开始，毛泽东同志指出，
  “在‘五四’以后，中国产生了完全崭新的文化生力军，这就是中国共产党人所领导的共产主义的文化思想，即共产主义的宇宙观和社会革命论。”五四运动开辟了知识分子和工农群众相结合的唯一正确的革命道路。因此，五四运动，对于我国近四十年来的历史发展，有着极其重大的意义。
    纪念五四运动，必须展开一个广泛的学习马克思列宁主义理论的运动。我国各族人民的伟大领袖毛泽东主席，是马克思列宁主义理论在我国最杰出的代表。中国革命和建设能够不断取得伟大的胜利，就是以毛泽东同志为首的中国共产党中央委员会坚持马克思列宁主义的理论和中国具体实际相结合的结果。我国的社会主义建设事业在各个战线上都已经取得极伟大的胜利，特别是1958年以来，我国工农业生产在党的建设社会主义总路线的光辉照耀下，取得了巨大的跃进，我国农村人民公社化运动也取得极伟大的胜利。我们的事业越是向前发展，也就越是需要对新的事物加强马克思列宁主义理论的研究和指导。我们要结合实际地、系统地学习理论。我们要提倡认真地读书。为了发展社会科学方面的理论研究工作，必须加强领导，培养理论工作队伍，鼓励社会科学工作者在马克思列宁主义的指导下，进行有系统的、长时期的努力，充分掌握有关的资料，从事独立的、创造性的研究，并且在为社会主义服务的基础上，贯彻执行“百花齐放，百家争鸣”的方针。必须提倡学习辩证唯物主义，反对唯心主义，反对形而上学。任何脱离实际的教条主义倾向，都是不对的，任何轻视理论的经验主义倾向，也是不对的。我们必须保持马克思列宁主义的纯洁性，继续粉碎南斯拉夫现代修正主义和其它各种现代修正主义的谬论，彻底肃清它的恶劣影响。
    纪念五四运动，必须坚决贯彻执行知识分子劳动化和工农群众知识化的方针。毛泽东同志说过“革命的或不革命的或反革命的知识分子的最后的分界，看其是否愿意并且实行和工农民众相结合。”现在，我国旧知识分子中间有不少人不仅真诚地愿意接受党的领导，为社会主义建设服务，而且开始深入到工农群众中去，参加斗争，参加生产劳动，把自己改造成为工人阶级的知识分子。我们必须继续贯彻执行党的教育方针，使教育为工人阶级政治服务，使教育和生产劳动相结合。为了把我国迅速建设成为一个具有现代工业、现代农业、现代科学文化的伟大的社会主义国家，我们必须培养一支广大的、又红又专的工人阶级知识分子队伍，特别要鼓励广大青年群众加强自我改造，向科学进军，掌握各门科学知识，努力攀登科学的高峰。我们必须不断提高广大工农群众的文化、科学技术水平，并且为了逐步消灭脑力劳动和体力劳动的界限而不懈地努力。
    纪念五四运动，必须发扬五四运动彻底革命的精神。五四运动以来的我国历史证明，要推翻帝国主义和封建主义的统治，要实现社会主义的崇高理想，就必须在无产阶级和共产党的领导下，团结一切可能团结的力量，向革命的敌人进行坚决的斗争。一切改良妥协的道路都是行不通的。五四运动以来的历史又告诉我们，社会是不断前进的，革命也要不断由低级阶段发展到高级阶段。在五四运动当时，中国革命的任务是反对帝国主义和封建势力，因此，必须坚决反对买办资产阶级和地主阶级思想。我们当前的任务，是彻底完成社会主义革命和取得社会主义建设的胜利，因此，必须坚决反对资产阶级思想，树立无产阶级思想，反对个人主义思想，树立集体主义思想。为了不被历史车轮抛到时代的后面去，人们就必须不断地提高觉悟，改造思想，经常站在时代的最前列，永远充当一个彻底的革命派。
    同志们！在五四运动以来的四十年当中，我国人民的斗争已经取得了极其辉煌的胜利。现在，全国人民正在为着争取更美好的明天，作着艰巨的努力。我们要鼓足干劲，依靠群众，克服各种困难，为完成和超额完成1959年工农业生产计划而奋斗。我们要彻底消灭西藏亲帝国主义分子的叛乱，粉碎帝国主义者和外国干涉者干涉我国内政、支持叛乱分子、破坏我国统一的阴谋！让我们在中国共产党和毛泽东主席的领导下，高举着马克思列宁主义的红旗，奋勇前进！
