Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, May 3rd: United Arab Republic's Egyptian Region Minister of Public Works, Musa Arafa, said at a press conference here today that the Soviet Union had invited a UAR delegation to visit the Soviet Union to discuss the final plans and blueprints for the first phase of the High Dam project with Soviet experts.

He said that the Soviet Union has studied the complete plans and designs of the first phase of the High Dam project. The Soviet Union also invited the UAR delegation to visit large dams and other construction projects underway in the Soviet Union. Arafa said that after approving the final blueprints and implementation plans, they decided to import equipment and machinery needed for the project from the Soviet Union, which the UAR could not yet manufacture. They also agreed to have some Soviet experts and technicians assist UAR experts in implementing the plan.

Arafa said that the UAR felt that the Soviet experts had demonstrated great ability and rich experience in their professions during their visits to the Egyptian region in November last year and March this year.

Arafa announced that after the completion of the Aswan Dam's hydroelectric power station, the UAR would begin the first phase of the High Dam project. He said that the UAR had completed most of the preparatory work for the project, such as building roads on both banks leading to the High Dam area, and erecting power lines to supply the electricity needed for the project.

Arafa expressed the hope that by the end of this year, construction of the High Dam would begin under the supervision of a joint management organization composed of Arab and Soviet engineers, led by Arab experts assisted by Soviet experts. It is estimated that this management organization will be established next month in order to be able to start planning how to carry out the project.

When a reporter asked whether there were any disagreements between the UAR and the Soviet Union regarding the blueprints of the project, Arafa said that there are many solutions to any project. As long as the proposed solutions meet the objectives of the project, then discussing various solutions cannot be considered a disagreement.

Arafa will lead a UAR delegation to Moscow on the 6th.

    讨论高水坝工程的计划和蓝图
    阿联代表团将去苏联
    新华社开罗3日电　阿拉伯联合共和国埃及地区公共工程部长穆萨·阿拉法今天在这里的记者招待会上说，苏联邀请阿联代表团访问苏联，以便同苏联专家一起讨论高水坝第一阶段工程的最后计划和蓝图。
    他说，苏联已经研究了高水坝第一阶段工程的全部计划和设计图，苏联还邀请阿联代表团参观苏联正在进行的大水坝和其他建设工程。阿拉法说，在批准最后蓝图和执行计划以后，他们决定从苏联输入阿联还不能制造的工程所需要的装备和机器。他们还同意由一些苏联专家和技术人员帮助阿联专家来执行计划。
    阿拉法说，阿联感到苏联专家在去年11月和今年3月访问埃及地区期间证明了他们在他们的专业方面有很大的能力和丰富经验。
  阿拉法宣布，在阿斯旺水坝的水力发电站完成后，阿联将开始进行高水坝的第一阶段工程。他说，阿联已经完成了工程的大部分准备工作，像在两岸建造通往高水坝地区的公路，架设电线以供应工程所需要的电力等必要措施。
    阿拉法表示希望到今年年底，将在阿拉伯和苏联工程师组成的联合管理机构的监督下开始高水坝的建设，这个管理机构是由得到苏联专家帮助的阿拉伯专家领导的。估计，将在下月成立这个管理机构，以便有可能开始筹划怎样来进行这项工程。
    有记者问，阿联同苏联之间对于工程的蓝图是否有不一致的意见。阿拉法说，任何工程都有许多处理办法，只要提出的处理办法符合工程的目的，那么讨论各种处理办法并不能认为是意见不一致。
    阿拉法将率领一个阿联代表团在6日动身去莫斯科。
