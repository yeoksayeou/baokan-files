Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, May 29th: The Soviet Party and Government Delegation currently visiting Albania continued its talks with the Albanian Party and Government Delegation in Tirana on the afternoon of the 29th. That same afternoon, the Soviet Delegation held a grand banquet at the Palace of Albanian Guerrillas.

Khrushchev, head of the Soviet Delegation, and Shehu, Chairman of the Albanian Council of Ministers, delivered speeches at the banquet.

Khrushchev said, "We hope that this visit to your country by the Soviet Party and Government Delegation will further strengthen and develop the friendship and fraternal cooperation between the Soviet people and the Albanian people, and between the peoples of all countries in the great socialist camp. The friendship between the peoples of socialist countries is one of the sources of their strength and invincible power. At the same time, this unbreakable friendship is one of the most important factors in strengthening world peace."

Khrushchev raised his glass to wish the People's Republic of Albania, which is confidently advancing along the road of socialism, new and greater achievements.

Shehu said in his speech, "Our people have the honor of receiving such distinguished guests and such outstanding activists for the first time in our country. This guest comes from his great motherland, from the first country to open the road to socialism and is currently marching towards communism with firm steps, from the country that points out the path of freedom and happiness to all the people of the world, from the glorious Soviet Union. Therefore, all our people—workers, peasants, youth, women, and our intellectuals—have turned these days into grand festivals. Therefore, all our people have experienced and are experiencing the happiest and most exciting unforgettable moments during these days."

In addition to Albanian Party and government leaders Hoxha and Shehu, and members of the Soviet delegation, the banquet was also attended by Grotewohl, Premier of the German Democratic Republic, who is vacationing here, and Marshal Peng Dehuai, head of the Chinese Military Friendship Delegation, who came to Albania for a friendly visit.

On the morning of this day, a group of delegation members of the Soviet delegation led by Mukhitdinov, accompanied by Kabo, a member of the Political Bureau of the Albanian Labor Party, visited the port of Durrës. (Attached picture)
