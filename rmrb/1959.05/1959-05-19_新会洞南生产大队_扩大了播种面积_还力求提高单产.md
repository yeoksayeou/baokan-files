From Guangzhou, May 18th - The Dongnan Production Brigade of Yaxi Commune in Xinhui County, Guangdong Province, which has expanded its early rice planting area by 20%, has recently concentrated its superior forces to vigorously grasp field management centered on accumulating fertilizer, making fertilizer, and topdressing. It is determined to strive for a greater harvest on the basis of expanding the planting area.

During the spring plowing season this year, the Yaxi Commune assigned the Dongnan Brigade an early rice planting area plan of 2,500 mu, a unit yield target of 500 jin, and a total output of 1.25 million jin. The cadres and members of this brigade tried every means to actively expand the planting area during rice transplanting, and as a result, a total of 3,000 mu of early rice was planted, 500 mu more than the task assigned by the commune. However, after the area was expanded, new problems emerged in the minds of some cadres. They believed that "even if the per-mu yield is lower with the expanded area, it doesn't matter, because the total output will not be less." Some even said that "originally, a per-mu yield of 500 jin was needed to complete the early rice production task, but now a per-mu yield of 400 jin will do." And they felt that "this year's early rice production task is easy to complete." Under the guidance of this thinking, after the transplanting was completed, the brigade, for a period of time in field management, due to dispersed leadership and dispersed labor, the labor force invested in cultivation and topdressing by each production team generally accounted for only about 20%, resulting in 1,050 mu of third-class seedlings. The members were very anxious when they saw that there was a lot of grass and lack of fertilizer in the rice fields, and they wanted to weed and topdress, but the team arranged for them to do other work. Some members criticized, "Last year, at this time, all the seedlings were dark green, but this year, large areas of seedlings are yellow and weak." More members made suggestions to the cadres, demanding strengthened leadership and concentrating superior forces to carry out weeding and topdressing.

The members' various criticisms and suggestions alerted the cadres. The brigade's Party branch immediately held a meeting of cadres, accepted the members' opinions, and criticized the erroneous understanding that "the early rice production task is easy to complete." Afterwards, it was decided to concentrate superior forces for a ten-day blitz to change the situation where the seedlings were not growing well enough. All brigade and production team cadres, regardless of what work they were originally doing, were all assigned to specific teams and groups, so that everyone had a labor quota and everyone had a work task. And implement overproduction rewards to strive to maximize total output on the basis of expanding the planting area.

Now, the seedlings of this brigade have all changed from being deficient in fertilizer, yellow, and weak, to growing lush and strong, ranking at the top in the commune.

    新会洞南生产大队
    扩大了播种面积
    还力求提高单产
    本报广州18日电　早稻播种面积扩大了20％的广东省新会县崖西公社洞南生产大队，最近集中优势兵力，大抓以积肥制肥追肥为中心的田间管理，决心在扩大播种面积的基础上，争取更大的丰收。
    今年春耕时，崖西公社分配给洞南大队的早稻播种面积计划是二千五百亩，单位产量指标是五百斤，总产量为一百二十五万斤。这个大队的干部和社员在插秧中多方设法，积极扩大播种面积，结果共插下了早稻三千亩，比公社下达的任务扩大了五百亩。可是，面积扩大以后，部分干部思想又出现了新的问题，他们认为“面积扩大了，亩产量低些也没问题，反正总产量不会少”。有人还说，原来要亩产五百斤才能完成早稻生产任务，现在亩产四百斤便行了。并且还觉得“今年早稻生产任务容易完成”。在这种思想指导下，插秧结束以后，这个大队在田间管理的一段时间内，由于领导分散，劳力分散，各生产小队投入中耕追肥的劳动力一般只占二成多，因此出现了一千零五十亩三类苗。社员们看见稻田草多、缺肥，十分焦急，想去除草追肥，但队里却安排去做其他工作。有的社员批评说：“去年现在禾苗全部浓绿了，今年禾苗大片黄弱。”更多的社员向干部提出建议，要求加强领导，集中优势力量进行耘田追肥。
    社员们的各种批评建议，使干部警觉起来。大队党支部马上召开干部会议，接受社员们的意见，批判了“早稻生产任务容易完成”的错误认识。之后，便决定集中优势兵力，突击十天，改变禾苗生长不够好的状况。所有大队和生产队的干部，不论原来抓什么工作，全部分别包队包组，做到人人有劳动定额，个个有工作任务。并实行超产奖励，争取在扩大播种面积的基础上，最大限度地提高总产量。
    现在，这个大队的禾苗已全部改变了缺肥黄弱的情况，生长青葱壮旺，在公社里跃居上游。
