   Recommending Several Good Children's Songs
  　Li Yaqun
    In the work of selecting and compiling Sichuan folk songs, I discovered a batch of children's songs that I think are quite beautiful. The "June 1st" Children's Day is approaching again, so I will try to transcribe a few here as a Children's Day gift.
    I think these children's songs are simple and vivid. They more or less reflect the spirit of the times, and have little or no adult tone. That's why I say they are quite beautiful. However, after all, I am also an adult, and the children's songs that I like may not be liked by the children. If the children read these children's songs and do not find them beautiful, and criticize me for being subjective and forcing children to eat children's songs that do not suit their tastes, this will be beneficial to my future selection and editing work.
    1. Mother gets up early to dig sweet potatoes, and the rooster next door crows. Rooster, rooster, don't crow, or you will wake up my younger brother who will want you to hold him.
    (Tian Mingren, Xiushan County)
    2. Little rooster, don't cry, the collective's grain must be cherished. Don't blame me for hitting you randomly, who told you to be greedy.
            (Zhi Guang)
    3. Little rooster, don't crow, the kindergarten is very lively. You go find the little bugs yourself, I won't deal with you.
    (Pu Dong Township, Yunyang County)
      4. After eating eggplants, keep the caps and use them as military hats. Greet Dad with a salute, and make a funny face to Mom.
            (Hai Tao)
        5. School is over, school is over, the older brothers and sisters run home. Mom sees them and quickly waves her hand: "Don't wake up your dad! Your dad didn't sleep last night, he stayed up all night repairing the waterwheel." The older brother nods, the older sister sticks out her tongue, the older brother holds the older sister's hand, and they tiptoe out.
            (Yu Zhibin)

   推荐几首好儿歌
  　李亚群
    在选编四川民歌的工作中，发现了一批我认为相当漂亮的儿歌。“六一”儿童节又快到了，试抄几首在这里，作为儿童节献礼。
    这些儿歌，我觉得朴实生动。它们或多或少地反映了时代风貌，而又没有或少有大人腔。所以我说它们相当漂亮。但是，毕竟我也是大人，我喜欢的儿歌，小朋友们未必也喜欢。如其小朋友们读了这些儿歌，并不感到它们漂亮，批评我是主观主义，把不适合小朋友们胃口的儿歌硬塞给小朋友们，这对于我今后的选编工作是有益处的。
    一妈妈早起挖红苕，隔壁公鸡喔喔叫。公鸡公鸡你莫叫，吵醒弟弟要你抱。
    （秀山县田明仁）
    二小公鸡，你莫哭，社里谷子要爱护，不要怪我乱打你，哪个叫你贪口福。
            （之光）
    三小公鸡，你莫叫，幼儿园里很热闹，你自去把小虫找，我不跟你打交道。
    （云阳县蒲东乡）
      四吃了茄子留盖盖，拿来当顶军帽戴。见了爸爸行个礼，见了妈妈做个怪。
            （海涛）
        五放学啦，放学啦，哥哥姐姐跑回家。妈妈见了忙摇手：“不要吵醒你爸爸！你爸昨夜没睡觉，修理水车熬通宵。”哥哥听了点点头，姐姐听了伸舌头，哥哥牵着姐姐手，踮起脚尖往外走。
            （于质彬）
