Resolutely Counter Indian Interventionists
Speech by Committee Member Yan Jialuo

Chairman, fellow committee members:

I fully support Premier Zhou's government work report, as well as the reports by Vice Premiers Li Fuchun and Li Xiannian, Vice Chairman Peng Zhen, and Vice Chairman Li Weihan. In particular, Premier Zhou's report not only provided me with profound socialist education, but also filled me with confidence in continuous progress and self-transformation.

I would now like to share some observations from my inspection tour of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, and also address the slander of our religious policy by U.S. imperialism.

On the basis of the great victory of the rectification campaign and the anti-rightist struggle, and inspired by the general line of socialist construction, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region achieved unprecedented and brilliant achievements in all areas of production during the great leap forward of socialist construction in 1958.

In the context of the nationwide campaign to produce steel, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region promoted the development of basic industries. By the end of 1958, 144 modern blast furnaces of five meters or more had been built, and semi-modern and various earthen blast furnaces were found throughout the region. Driven by the iron and steel industry, the coal, electricity, machinery, forestry and other industries have all experienced rapid development. The giant of the grasslands, Baotou Iron and Steel (one of China's three major steel bases), saw its No. 1 blast furnace, with a daily output of over 2,000 tons, produce iron as a gift to the Party on "July 1st." After its basic construction is completed in 1961, and fully put into production in 1962, Baotou Iron and Steel's annual total output value will reach tens of billions of yuan. This will bring about a tremendous change of historical significance to the economic development of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region.

Since the Great Leap Forward, workers have been using their soaring energy, selfless labor, breaking superstitions, emancipating their minds, and using the spirit of daring to think, speak, and act to invent and create products that exceed international standards in quality. In the situation where the East wind prevails over the West wind, many industrial products across the country have exceeded international levels. The licorice paste produced by the Hohhot Pharmaceutical Factory in Inner Mongolia has already surpassed that of the United States.

At the same time, many industries in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region have rapidly caught up with the advanced domestic levels during the Great Leap Forward. For example, the photosensitive instrument invented and created by the Hohhot Film Studio is the first one made in our country using indigenous methods; the Baotou Automobile Repair and Mechanical Plant has created tractors, automobiles, as well as portable boilers and diesel engines.

Since the Great Leap Forward, a vigorous development has also emerged in culture, education, and health in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region. The policy of education serving proletarian politics and combining education with productive labor has been implemented in cultural, educational, and health undertakings; a new atmosphere of schools running factories and factories running schools has emerged. Elementary education was basically universalized in 1958, and the number of various middle schools increased from 126 in 1957 to 760; the number of institutions of higher learning increased from four to twenty-one. At the same time, a patriotic health campaign centered on the elimination of the four pests was widely and deeply carried out. After collectivization, the communes ran 795 hospitals.

After collectivization, the rural and pastoral areas of Inner Mongolia have realized the unparalleled superiority of the people's communes! Grain and livestock production has increased at a high speed. In 1958, members of all ethnic groups in rural areas obtained an unprecedented bumper harvest, with total grain output reaching 11.8 billion jin. The single economy left over from thousands of years in pastoral areas has been replaced by a diversified economy, so a thriving new atmosphere has emerged in pastoral areas. The bumper harvest of winter and spring lambs is unprecedented, with over 4.14 million winter and spring lambs surviving. Improved breeds account for more than 60 percent.

The astonishing achievements in industrial, agricultural, and livestock production construction can be definitively said to be the victory of the Party's socialist general line; the great result of the nationwide rectification movement; and the result of the hard work of people of all ethnic groups and the vast number of workers under the leadership of the Party Central Committee, Chairman Mao, and the Party committees at all levels in Inner Mongolia.

It is very clear that on the basis of the Great Leap Forward in 1958, people of all ethnic groups and the vast number of workers, with full confidence and soaring enthusiasm, under the leadership of the Party, giving prominence to politics, and emancipating their minds, will surely be able to complete the production plan for a greater leap forward in 1959, and are very likely to overfulfill it.

The ambitious second five-year plan for agriculture and animal husbandry in the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region is: to increase the total number of livestock from 24.47 million head in 1958 to 60 million head by 1962. To increase the number of live pigs from 3 million in 1958 to 32.5 million by 1962. By 1962, the average per capita annual meat consumption will be 180 to 200 jin, 800 eggs, and 500 jin of milk. The total grain output will increase from 11.8 billion jin in 1958 to 75 billion jin in 1962; by 1962, the average per capita annual grain intake will be 5,769 jin. The high-speed development of agriculture and animal husbandry will greatly change the face of the autonomous region!

In the ten years since liberation, from my personal experience, I have deeply realized that in my beloved motherland, freedom of religious belief is completely free and is protected by law. The Party and the government have consistently advocated and resolutely implemented the policy of freedom of religious belief, which is not only well-known but also an undeniable fact.

After lamenting the shameful failure of the rebellion in Tibet, U.S. imperialism has rampantly fabricated rumors and slandered China for "destroying religion." It is also preparing a report to slander our religious policy. This hypocritical conspiracy of "protecting religion" is not unfamiliar to us Chinese Christians. Looking at the history of imperialist aggression against China over the past century, haven't imperialists used Christianity to carry out heinous activities of aggression against our country under the guise of "spreading the gospel and saving souls"? Furthermore, didn't imperialists, through their running dogs, the Ni Xisheng and Wang Mingdao counter-revolutionary groups, engage in activities of betraying the motherland, opposing the people, and undermining socialist construction, committing heinous crimes under the religious cloak and in the name of "for faith"? When we strip off the cloak of "protecting religion" from U.S. imperialism and see its essence, what is it "religious guardian"? It is a savage wolf with the ambition of destroying human peace and happiness, destroying people's souls, and destroying the brutal colonial rule of religion!

These shameless lies of U.S. imperialism have been completely shattered in the face of facts! Its slander is completely in vain. The deliberate fabrication of this clumsy lie by U.S. imperialists cannot deceive anyone! May I ask, who kidnapped the Dalai Lama? Who set up cannons in the Potala Palace? Who looted valuable offerings from temples? Wasn't it the traitors? The traitors have done all kinds of bad things, and the People's Liberation Army was ordered to suppress the rebellion precisely to protect the interests of the Tibetan people and to protect freedom of religious belief.

Protecting freedom of religious belief is stipulated by the Constitution, but while the state protects freedom of religious belief, religious believers must also love the country and abide by the law. Chairman Liu Shaoqi clearly pointed out in his report on the draft Constitution of the People's Republic of China: "According to the provisions of the draft Constitution, our country will, as in the past, effectively guarantee citizens' right to freedom of religious belief. However, guaranteeing freedom of religious belief and guaranteeing freedom of counter-revolutionary activities are two absolutely different things. Our Constitution and all laws will never allow those who engage in counter-revolutionary activities under the guise of religion to gain any convenience." The Tibetan traitors kidnapped the Dalai Lama, looted valuable offerings from temples, and even killed and insulted monks and nuns. Is this protecting religion? What the Tibetan rebels did was not within the scope of religion; they were wolves in religious clothing. What they did was a criminal activity of betraying the motherland. Their treasonous acts not only violated national law, but also betrayed religious doctrines. Quelling the rebellion not only upheld national law, but also eliminated a major harm for the religious community. U.S. imperialists hypocritically appear as "defenders of the faith" and slander our suppression of the rebellion as "destroying religion." Its intention is to use the name of religion to maliciously provoke discord, vainly attempting to undermine our national unity, pull Tibet out of the embrace of our motherland, and achieve its goal of divide and rule colonial rule. U.S. imperialists, I want to tell you loudly! Your conspiracy, your evil intentions and goals, have been completely bankrupt in front of the great Chinese people who have been liberated from the rule of the three great enemies of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism! The era when U.S. imperialists used the name of religion to create division in order to achieve their goals of divide and rule colonial rule is gone forever in front of the Chinese people who have stood up!

The Tibetan rebels, who have cut themselves off from the people, vainly attempted to undermine national unity and create a split in the motherland, but instead promoted the consolidation of the motherland's unity; promoted the closeness of national unity; and promoted the acceleration of Tibet's prosperity. Eradicating the rebels and quelling the rebellion, while upholding national law, also actually protected freedom of religious belief.

This blatant and despicable practice of fabricating facts, creating rumors, and slandering by U.S. imperialism has aroused the severe condemnation and strong opposition of us Christians and religious figures across the country! The heinous Tibetan rebels are doomed to self-destruction, and the U.S. imperialists who support the rebels will also perish in the same way!

After reading the so-called "statement of the Dalai Lama" distributed by Indian diplomatic personnel, which fabricated rumors and slandered the motherland in every possible way, and talked about the absurd document of so-called Tibetan independence; and seeing in the People's Daily that under the connivance of the Indian police authorities, "demonstrators" in Bombay openly and rampantly insulted the image of our head of state, the great leader loved by 650 million people, it is truly infuriating and extremely indignant. If the Indian expansionist elements inherit the mantle of British imperialist aggression, and vainly attempt to make a fuss about the Tibet issue, trying to take the opportunity to achieve the purpose of muddying the waters, that is truly a pipe dream. We want to solemnly warn all imperialists and reactionaries that the Chinese people who have stood up will never allow anyone to interfere in our country's internal affairs! We will never allow anyone to touch any part of our country's sacred territory! The Chinese people who have stood up love peace, but are by no means weak and can be bullied. Any imperialist and reactionary who dares to undermine our country's unity will be resolutely counterattacked by 600 million people! Any imperialist and reactionary who attempts to separate Tibet from the motherland will be crushed to pieces by the rolling wheels of history moving forward with the force of a thunderbolt!

### 坚决反击印度干涉者  阎迦勒委员的发言

    坚决反击印度干涉者
    阎迦勒委员的发言主席、各位委员：
    我完全拥护周总理的政府工作报告，李富春副总理、李先念副总理、彭真副委员长、李维汉副主席的各项报告。特别是周总理的报告既使我受到了深刻的社会主义教育，又给我充满不断进步和自我改造的信心。
    我现在要就在内蒙古自治区视察的观感，和对美帝国主义对我宗教政策的诬蔑，讲几句话。
    内蒙古自治区在整风和反右派斗争伟大胜利的基础上，在党的英明领导下，在社会主义建设总路线的鼓舞下，一九五八年社会主义建设全面的大跃进中，各项生产事业，都获得了空前辉煌的成就。
    内蒙古自治区在全党全民大办钢铁的形势下，促进了基础工业的发展。到一九五八年底，已建起五公尺以上的洋高炉一百四十四座，半土半洋和各种土高炉遍及全区各个地区。在钢铁工业带动下，煤炭、电力、机械、森林等工业，都有了飞跃的发展。草原上的巨人，我国三大钢铁基地之一的包钢，它的日产二千多吨的一号高炉出铁，作为在“七一”向党的献礼。它在一九六一年基本建设完成，到一九六二年全部投入生产后，包钢每年的总产值，就达几十亿元。这对内蒙古自治区的经济发展，将会起具有历史意义的巨大变化。
    大跃进以来，工人们以冲天的干劲，忘我的劳动，破除迷信，解放思想，以敢想敢说敢做的精神，发明创造出生产质量超过国际水平的产品。在东风压倒西风的形势下，全国各地许多工业产品，已超过了国际水平。仅就内蒙古呼和浩特市制药厂所生产的甘草膏，已超过了美国。
    同时，内蒙古自治区还有许多工业，在大跃进中已飞快的赶上了国内先进水平。如呼和浩特市电影制片厂，发明创造的感光仪，是我国土办法制造第一台；包头汽车修配和机械厂，已创造出拖拉机、汽车，以及锅驼机和柴油机等。
    大跃进以来，内蒙古自治区文教卫生也出现了一个蓬勃发展的局面。在文教卫生事业上贯彻了教育为无产阶级政治服务和教育与生产劳动相结合的方针；出现了学校办工厂，工厂办学校的新气象。一九五八年基本普及了小学教育，各类中学由一九五七年一百二十六所，增加到七百六十所；高等学校由四所发展到二十一所。同时广泛深入地展开了以除四害为中心的爱国卫生运动。公社化后，社举办的医院，就有七百九十五处。
    公社化后，内蒙古的农村、牧区，已体会到人民公社无比的优越性！粮食、牲畜有了高速度的增产。农村各族社员，在一九五八年获得了空前未有的丰收，粮食总产量达到一百一十八亿斤。牧区千年遗留下来的单一经济，已被多种经济所代替，所以在牧区出现了欣欣向荣的新气象。冬春羔的丰收是史无前例的，冬春羔已成活四百一十四万多只。改良羔占百分之六十以上。
    工、农、牧各项生产建设事业，所获得的惊人的成绩，肯定地说，是党的社会主义总路线的胜利；是全民整风运动伟大的成果；是在党中央、毛主席以及内蒙古各级党委的领导下，各族人民和广大职工以冲天干劲劳动的结果。
    非常显然地看出，在一九五八年大跃进基础上，各族人民、广大职工，信心百倍，干劲冲天，在党的领导下，政治挂帅，思想解放，这样生气勃勃生产的情况下，必能完成一九五九年更大跃进的生产计划，并且很有可能超额完成。
    内蒙古自治区农牧业，豪迈的第二个五年计划是：牲畜总头数从一九五八年的二千四百四十七万头，到一九六二年发展到六千万头。生猪从一九五八年三百万口，到一九六二年发展到三千二百五十万口。到一九六二年按人口平均计算每人每年食肉量一百八十斤至二百斤、蛋八百个、奶五百斤。粮食总产量从一九五八年的一百一十八亿斤，到一九六二年将达到七百五十亿斤；到一九六二年每人每年平均可得粮食五千七百六十九斤。农牧业的高速度发展，将大大地改变自治区的面貌！
    解放十年来，从我切身的经历中，深深体会到在我可爱的祖国，宗教信仰是完全自由的，是受到法律保护的。党和政府一贯主张，并且坚决贯彻执行宗教信仰自由的政策，这不但是众所共知的，也是铁一般的事实。
    美帝国主义在哀叹西藏叛乱遭到可耻的失败之后，就大肆造谣诬蔑说什么中国在“毁灭宗教”。并且还在准备诬蔑我国宗教政策的报告。它的这种假惺惺地以“保护宗教”出现的阴谋手法，对于我们中国基督教徒说来，倒也并不生疏。从近百年来帝国主义侵华史看到，帝国主义利用基督教，对我国进行侵略的罪恶活动，岂不是在“传福音，救灵魂”的幌子下干的吗？再看，帝国主义通过它的走狗倪析声、王明道反革命集团，进行背叛祖国，反对人民，破坏社会主义建设的活动，犯下了滔天罪行，岂不是披上了宗教外衣，以“为了信仰”为名么？当我们剥下了美帝国主义“保护宗教”的外衣，看到它的本质时，它那是什么“宗教的护卫者”，它原是摧毁人类的和平幸福，摧毁人的心灵，摧毁宗教的残暴的殖民统治的野心狼！
    美帝国主义这些无耻的谰言，在事实面前，已经完全被粉碎了！它的这种造谣诬蔑，完全是枉费心机。美帝国主义者别有用心的捏造这种拙劣的谎言，欺骗不了任何人！试问，劫持达赖喇嘛的是谁？在布达拉宫架设大炮的是谁？劫走寺庙贵重供器的是谁？不正是叛国分子干的吗？叛国分子干尽了坏事，人民解放军奉命讨伐叛匪，正是为了保护西藏人民的利益和保护宗教信仰自由。
    保护宗教信仰自由，是宪法所规定的，但是国家保护宗教信仰自由，而宗教徒也必须爱国守法。刘少奇委员长早在关于中华人民共和国宪法草案的报告中，即已明确指出：“根据宪法草案规定，我们的国家将如同过去一样切实地保障公民有宗教信仰自由的权利。但是，保障宗教信仰自由和保障反革命活动自由，是绝对不能混同的两件事，我们的宪法和一切法律同样是永远不会让那些披着宗教外衣进行反革命活动的分子得到一点方便的。”西藏叛国分子既劫持达赖喇嘛，又劫走寺庙贵重供器，并且还杀害侮辱僧尼，难道这是在保护宗教吗？西藏叛匪所干的，并不在宗教范围之内，他们是披着宗教外衣的豺狼。他们所干的，是背叛祖国的罪恶活动。他们的叛国行为，不仅违反国法，而且也是背叛宗教教义。平息叛乱，不仅维护了国法，而且也是给宗教界除了大害。美帝国主义者伪善地以“卫道者”的面貌出现，诬蔑我们的平息叛乱是“毁灭宗教”。它的企图是利用宗教名义，恶毒地进行挑拨离间，妄想破坏我们的民族团结，把西藏从我们祖国的怀抱里拉出去，达到它分而治之的殖民统治的目的。美帝国主义者，我要厉声地告诉你！你的这种阴谋诡计，罪恶的企图和目的，在从帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本主义三大敌人的统治下，获得了解放的伟大的中国人民面前，已经完全破产了！美帝国主义者利用宗教名义妄想制造分裂，为了达到它分而治之的殖民统治的时代，在站起来的中国人民面前一去而不复返了！
    自绝于人民的西藏叛匪，妄想破坏民族团结，造成祖国分裂，结果却促进了祖国统一的巩固；促进了民族团结的紧密；促进了西藏繁荣的加速。肃清叛匪，平息叛乱，在维护国家法律的同时，在实际上也保护了宗教信仰自由。
    美帝国主义这种公然采取捏造事实，造谣诬蔑的卑鄙做法，激起了我们基督教徒和全国宗教界人士，严厉的谴责和强烈的反对！罪恶滔天的西藏叛匪是怎样的自取灭亡，支持叛匪的美帝国主义也必照样同归灭亡！
    读了由印度外交人员散发的所谓“达赖喇嘛的声明”对祖国百般造谣诬蔑，大谈其所谓西藏独立荒谬透顶的文件；并在人民日报看到了在印度警察当局纵容下，孟买“示威者”公然在我领事馆前猖狂的污辱我国元首、六亿五千万人民所敬爱的伟大领袖的像，真令人怒发直冲，万分愤慨。印度扩张主义分子们承继了英帝国主义侵略的衣钵，妄想在西藏问题上做什么文章，企图趁机达到混水摸鱼目的的话，那真是痴人作梦。我们要正告一切帝国主义和反动派，已经站起来了的中国人民决不允许任何人干涉我国的内政！决不允许任何人染指我国任何部分的神圣领土！已经站起来的中国人民是热爱和平的，但决不是软弱可欺的，任何帝国主义和反动派，胆敢破坏我国的统一，必将遭到六亿人民坚决的回击！任何帝国主义和反动派，想使西藏脱离祖国的企图，都将要被以雷霆万钧之势向前滚动的历史车轮碾得粉碎！
