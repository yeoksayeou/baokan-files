    Strengthen Responsibility Systems, Increase Labor Efficiency
    Qingyuan Xibu Team Implements Group Contract Piece-Rate Card System
    Hengyang Satellite Brigade Implements Continuous Crop Rotation and Segmented Work Arrangement Method

    (Our report) The Xibu Production Team of Nankouqian People's Commune in Qingyuan County, Liaoning Province, implemented a group (or individual) contract piece-rate card system based on grasping "small-segment plans" during the spring plowing season. This has proven to be an effective measure for strengthening the production team's planned management and improving the labor efficiency of its members. Because of this method, the Xibu Production Team implemented the team's small-segment work plans down to each member, so that each member knew in advance what kind of work to do for each segment, how much to do, and how much remuneration they could get, thereby greatly improving their labor enthusiasm and initiative.

    Although this team knew how to use "small-segment plans" to guide production very early on, they still assigned work temporarily every day, resulting in a chaotic "people piling up" situation. Every night, they had to evaluate work and record points, making work and production very busy and passive.

    In early April, the work team of the Qingyuan County Committee of the Communist Party of China came to this team and helped them find that the main reason for the busy and chaotic work and production was that the "small-segment plans" had not taken root among the masses, and therefore the labor enthusiasm and initiative of the members had not been fully utilized. After joint research by the County Committee work team, team cadres, and members, and drawing on the labor management experience of the past advanced cooperatives, it was decided to adopt the "group (or individual) contract piece-rate card system" based on the "small-segment plan." That is, the team established and printed four kinds of production cards or forms: "Small-Segment Plan," "Group (or Individual) Contract Piece-Rate Card," "Member Labor Record," and "Small-Segment Summary." The "Small-Segment Plan" was set every five days, specifying the types of agricultural work to be completed by the entire team within five days, the amount of work, the start and end times, the labor and animal power required, and the division of labor among the team committee leaders. After completing the "Small-Segment Plan," the small-segment work was then implemented down to each member in a tailored manner through the "Group (or Individual) Contract Piece-Rate Card" form. The type of work, work address, amount of work, completion date, quality requirements, and remuneration to be paid were all clearly filled in on the card. On the back of the card was attached a "Group Labor Record": the work points remuneration that each member of the group should obtain each day according to the contract piece-rate regulations was evaluated by the group for comparison and recorded on it by the group leader, reported to the team committee every five days, and transferred to the team's labor ledger. When a segment of the "Small-Segment Plan" was completed, a "Small-Segment Summary" was carried out, and the next "Small-Segment Plan" was formulated at the same time. The "Small-Segment Summary" included an inspection and summary of the task completion, existing problems and their causes, and main experiences and lessons learned. On the one hand, it checked the previous stage of work, and on the other hand, it pointed out the direction for improving the work in the next stage. These four cards and forms are very simple to use, which is convenient for leadership to master and is welcomed by the members.

    Although the Xibu Production Team has implemented this new method for a short period of time, it has achieved remarkable results in promoting current production. Its benefits are: First, because the agricultural work and remuneration for each segment are specifically arranged in advance, the plan is implemented, the tasks are clear, and more work leads to more pay, which greatly stimulates the labor enthusiasm and initiative of the members. Members who used to frequently be absent from work are now attending. Labor efficiency has generally increased by about 30% or more compared to the past. During the first "Small-Segment Plan" period, the entire team originally planned to use fifty workers to dig up seventy-five acres of hawthorn in five days, but it was completed in only four days. Under the promotion of group (or individual) contract piece-rate, the work of delivering fertilizer, plowing the land, and rice seedling nurseries have also progressed rapidly. Second, the team was freed from a series of busy tasks such as assigning work, evaluating work, and recording points every day, and a new situation of well-organized production order emerged. Not only can team cadres better participate in production and lead production, but members can also better carry out labor and rest. Third, it establishes production labor archives for the entire team and each member, which can not only better ensure the implementation of the production responsibility system, but also accumulate data for evaluating "good members" and for further research and improvement of production labor management issues in the future. Fourth, it is convenient to carry out competitions between groups and between people within the team, providing favorable conditions for improving labor efficiency and ensuring the realization of production plans.

    (Our report) The Weixing Brigade of Kuzong People's Commune in Hengyang County, Hunan Province, recently implemented the method of continuous crop rotation and segmented work arrangement based on work groups, fully leveraging the enthusiasm of its members.

    After collectivization, the attendance rate of members of the Weixing Brigade often reached more than 90%, but because work was arranged temporarily every day, it often formed a situation of "people piling up," resulting in low work efficiency. In response to this situation, the Party Branch focused on the first work group of the first production team and convened a meeting of all members to mobilize everyone to come up with ideas on how to arrange work. Farmer Chen Songyi first expressed his opinion, saying: "Work should be done according to the matter, major matters should be done together, minor matters should be done separately, and strong and weak labor and technology should be matched well to avoid 'people piling up.' Based on my experience, plowing fields and spreading ditch manure can be done by only three or four people." Everyone also agreed that the work arrangement of the work group should adapt to the agricultural season and the interrelationship between each agricultural task. The tasks to be done currently should be listed one by one, distinguishing between the important and urgent, and then, according to the strength of each member's labor, the level of technology, and appropriately taking care of the distance of residence, temporary agricultural work co-op groups should be organized for each item. Each group should select a member with good ideology and high technology to specifically responsible for the work arrangement, point calculation, and quality inspection. In this way, some large-scale works suitable for continuous operation, such as plowing fields, building field ridges, spreading fertilizer, leveling fields, transplanting rice seedlings, and inter-cultivation and top-dressing, are contracted to the co-op temporary groups. In order to ensure the quality of work, the work group establishes a responsibility system for the co-op temporary groups, implementing "four fixings" (fixing tasks, fixing time, fixing work points, and fixing quality). Some small and scattered tasks that are not suitable for continuous operation, such as herding cattle, chopping pigweed, raising fish, storing water, and watching water, are contracted to specialists.

    After the method of continuous crop rotation and segmented work arrangement was promoted throughout the brigade, cadres no longer have to shout for people to come to work every day, and members no longer have to wait for assignments. Everyone has a clear idea of what they are doing, where they are doing it, the size of the task, and how many work points they will get, thereby greatly improving work efficiency.

    Members summarized that this kind of work arrangement has the following major advantages: First, it can rationally use labor, so that everyone can give full play to their talents and use their talents to the fullest. Member Chen Guishi's legs were not working well. After co-op work arrangement, he was arranged to spread silt and pull seedlings in Chen Guiyin's group, giving full play to his strengths. In the past, he used to do seven or eight points a day, but now it has increased to twelve points. Second, a normal production order has been established, so that you don’t wait for me and I don’t urge you, and production can proceed in an orderly manner. Third, it strengthens unity and mutual assistance. Fourth, the co-op group implements "four fixings," with responsibility to the person, guaranteeing the quality of work. Fifth, after implementing co-op segmented work arrangement, the group leader can calculate the work points by the field, avoiding staying up late at night to evaluate work points, and also avoiding incorrect or missed records. Sixth, there are key members responsible for everything, which is convenient for leadership. In the past, each production battle unit—the work group—had twenty-odd households, averaging seventy or eighty people. There was only one work group leader, who could not form a core. It was difficult for one person to grasp twenty-odd households with a hundred people, and it was difficult to grasp production, ideology, and life. Now, after the establishment of five or six agricultural work co-op temporary groups under the work group, the backbone force has been increased, promoting work.

    After implementing the method of continuous crop rotation and segmented work arrangement, all six production teams of the brigade finished the transplanting of early and mid-season rice ahead of schedule. At the same time, each production team also organized a part of the labor force to engage in cash crop production and seize sideline income. In just five days after transplanting rice seedlings, the entire brigade seized more than 1,100 yuan in cash income. (Huang Shengpu)

    加强责任制度  提高劳动效率
    清原西卜小队推行小组包工计件卡片制
    衡阳卫星大队实行农活连作分段排工法
    本报讯  辽宁清原县南口前人民公社西卜生产小队在春耕中，抓“小段计划”的基础上推行小组（或个人）包工计件卡片制，证明是一项加强生产队的计划管理和提高社员劳动效率的有效措施。西卜生产小队由于推行这种办法，把队的小段作业计划落实到每个社员身上，使每个社员对每一段要作什么活、作多少、可得多少报酬在事前心中有数，因而大大提高了劳动积极性和主动性。
    这个小队虽然很早就知道利用“小段计划”来指导生产，但是每天仍然是临时派工，干活一窝蜂，每天晚上都要进行评工记分，工作生产十分忙乱被动。
    4月初，中共清原县委工作组来到这个队，帮助他们找到了工作生产忙乱的主要原因是“小段计划”没有在群众中生根，因此社员的劳动积极性和主动性未得充分发挥。经过县委工作组和队干部、社员们共同研究，吸收过去高级社的劳动管理经验，决定采取在“小段计划”的基础上推行“小组（或个人）包工计件卡片制”。即由小队建立和印制“小段计划”、“小组（或个人）包工计件卡片”、“社员劳动记录”、“小段总结”等四种生产卡片或表格。“小段计划”五天订一次，在“小段计划”上把全队五天内要完成的农活种类、工作数量、起止时间、需用的人工和畜工、队委领导分工等都订好。订完“小段计划”后，随之就把小段活计通过“小组（或个人）包工计件卡片”的形式，因人制宜地落实到每个社员身上。在卡片上把工种、工作地址、工作数量、完成日期、质量要求、付给的报酬等都填写清楚。在卡片的背面附有“小组劳动记录”：把参加劳动的小组成员每天按照包工计件的规定所应取得的工分报酬，经小组对照评定，由小组长登记在上面，五天一报队委会，转记到小队的劳动工账上。一段“小段计划”执行完了时，进行一次“小段总结”，同时制订下个“小段计划”。在“小段总结”中，把完成任务情况、存在的问题和原因、主要经验教训加以检查总结。一方面检查了上段工作，又为下段改进工作指出了方向。这四种卡片和表格使用起来都很简便，既便于领导掌握，也受社员欢迎。
    西卜生产小队推行这种新方法，虽然时间还很短，但对推动当前生产已收到显著效果。它的好处是：一、由于每一段的农活和报酬事先都做了具体安排，计划落实，任务明确，多劳多得，因而大大激发了社员的劳动积极性和主动性。过去经常不出勤的社员也出勤了。劳动效率普遍比过去约提高30％以上。全小队在第一个“小段计划”期间，原计划五天内用五十个人工刨完七十五亩地的楂子，结果只用四天的时间便完成了。在小组（或个人）包工计件的推动下，送肥、翻地、水稻畦苗等工作也都进展很快。二、使小队摆脱了每天都要派工、评工、记分等一系列忙乱的事务，出现了生产秩序井井有条的新局面，不但小队干部可以更好地参加生产领导生产，社员也可以更好地进行劳动和休息了。三、为全队和每个社员建立了生产劳动档案，不但能更好保证生产责任制的贯彻，同时可以为评选“好社员”和为今后进一步研究改进生产劳动管理问题积累资料。四、便于在队内开展组与组、人与人的竞赛，为提高劳动效率和保证生产计划的实现提供有利的条件。      （高方）
    本报讯  湖南衡阳县库宗公社卫星大队，最近以作业组为单位实行农活连作分段排工法，充分发挥了社员的积极性。
    公社化以后，卫星大队社员出工率经常达到90％以上，但是由于每天临时排工，往往形成“人打堆”，工效不高。党总支针对这一情况，以第一生产队第一作业组为重点，召开了全组社员会议，就如何排工的问题发动大家出主意。农民陈颂仪首先发表意见，他说：“做事要看事做事，大事合着干，小事分开做，劳力、技术强弱搭配好，避免‘人打堆’。凭我的经验，犁田、撒沟粪，只要三、四个人就搞得了。”大家还一致认为，作业组排工应当适应农事季节和每项农活相互间的连带关系，把当前要做的事一项一项摆出来，分清轻重缓急，然后根据每个社员的劳力强弱、技术高低，并适当照顾居住远近，分项组织农活连作临时小组，各组选出一个思想好、技术高的社员具体负责排工计分和检查工夫质量。这样对一些宜于连作的大活，如犁田、上田塍脚、撒肥、平田、插秧以及中耕、追肥等连贯性的大农活就包到各连作临时小组。为了保证工夫质量，作业组对连作临时小组建立责任制，实行“四定”（定任务、定时间、定工分、定质量）。对一些不宜于连作的小活零活，如看牛、打猪草、养鱼、蓄水看水等就包到专人。
    农活连作分段排工的办法，在全大队推广以后，干部再不要天天喊人出工，社员也不再等候分配了。自己做什么事，在什么地方，任务大小，多少工分都各自有底，从而工效大大提高。
    社员总结这样排工有以下几大好处：一、能合理使用劳力，做到人尽其才，才尽其用。社员陈贵石脚不好使，通过连作排工以后，安排他在陈贵银小组撒淤扯秧，发挥了他的特长，过去他每天做七、八分，现在提高到十二分。二、建立了正常的生产秩序，不要你等我，我催你，生产能进行得有条有理。三、加强了团结互助。四、连作小组实行“四定”，责任到人，保证了工夫质量。五、实行连作分段排工以后，小组负责人在田边就可以计好工分，以免晚上熬夜评工分，而且不会错记漏记。六、事事有骨干负责，领导方便，以前每个生产战斗单位——作业组都有二十来户，平均七、八十人，只有一个作业组长，形不成核心，一人抓二十来户百把人，对生产、思想、生活都很难抓好，如今作业组以下成立五、六个农活连作临时小组以后，增加了骨干力量，推动了工作。
    实行农活连作分段排工法后，全大队六个生产队都提早结束了早、中稻的插秧工作；同时，各生产队还组织了一部分劳力搞经济作物生产和抓副业现金收入。仅在插秧后五天，全大队就抓回现金收入一千一百多元。      （黄生谱）
