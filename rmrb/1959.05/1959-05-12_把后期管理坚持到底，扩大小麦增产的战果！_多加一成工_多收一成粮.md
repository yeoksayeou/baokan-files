Persist in Late-Stage Management to Expand the Gains of Wheat Production!
Add 10% More Effort, Harvest 10% More Grain
Shanxi Concentrates Efforts on Stalks, Ears, and Grains; Anhui Organizes Masses to Vigorously Prevent Wheat Rust

Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, 11th. Shanxi Province's wheat-producing areas are vigorously dispelling the notion that "wheat is already set, and late-stage processing is of little use," and are redoubling their efforts to carry out the late-stage management movement in wheat fields. Wheat farmers in the wheat-growing region have decided to launch a vigorous and down-to-earth high tide of late-stage processing and management of wheat from mid-May through the thirty days spanning May and June, to expand the gains of the wheat production increase movement and strive to increase wheat production even more.

Currently, the leading departments of each wheat-producing area, after careful deployment, field inspection and ranking, allocation of labor, and formulation of specific measures and indicators, are making the late-stage processing movement in wheat fields spread more and more rapidly. Jinan Prefecture, a major wheat-producing area in Shanxi Province, recently conducted field inspections and ranking. Of the 8.2 million mu of wheat in the region, first-class wheat accounts for 40%, second-class wheat accounts for 46%, and third-class wheat accounts for 14%. Recently, there have been two consecutive spring rains here. The Jinan Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party requires all localities to seize the good opportunity after the rain to concentrate their efforts on two tasks: First, universally spray phosphate fertilizer and apply ashes to all wheat fields, giving "preferential treatment" to backward fields, and resolutely eliminate third-class fields. Second, resolutely implement lodging prevention measures. Regions with conditions should build windbreak frames and use bamboo poles to remove dew drops from the plant leaves to reduce the weight on the stalks and prevent lodging. For lodged wheat, frames should be set up to support it, allowing for ventilation and light, and normal growth. More than 100,000 professional personnel are stationed throughout the region, and they will persist from now until harvest, striving to increase wheat production by 20 to 30 jin per mu, and increase wheat production by about 200 million jin throughout the region. In the Taihang Mountains, Jincheng and Yangcheng counties have organized inspection groups of 10,000 people each to help backward wheat fields catch up with advanced wheat fields, inspecting while carrying out intensive processing and management of backward fields. While gradually completing spring planting tasks, Jinzhong and Jinbei regions are gradually transferring labor to prepare for a late-stage wheat field management campaign to fight for increased wheat production.

This year, Shanxi Province's 16 million mu of wheat have thick stalks and lush leaves, growing excellently, better than in any previous year. Wheat in the Jinan Plain is generally flowering and filling, while wheat in the Taihang Mountains, Jin Southeast Prefecture, and Jinzhong area is currently heading. The spring wheat that was expanded for the first time this year in the Yanbei ancient Great Wall border region and the Luliang Mountains in northwestern Shanxi, where wheat was previously scarce, is also rolling with wheat waves and a sea of green, showing a scene of abundance. Faced with the upcoming bumper harvest, farmers in various regions are jubilant and are doing everything possible to consolidate and expand the results of the bumper harvest. However, there is also a saying in various regions that the bumper wheat harvest is already set, and processing is irrelevant. In fact, some areas are experiencing drought and need to ensure the water demand in the later stages of wheat production from multiple aspects; in order to ensure large ears, full grains, and large kernels, more fertilizer and nutrition are needed; in terms of insect and wind prevention, although great achievements have been made, it is still necessary to persist. In short, there is not nothing to do in the later stages of wheat fields, but there are many things to do; late-stage processing is not useless, but is very important. Therefore, Party committees at all levels have adopted the method of great airing of views, great debates, great investigations, great accounting, and great mobilization to solve ideological problems and clarify the current status of wheat growth. Now, all localities have carried out a comprehensive mobilization for late-stage processing based on the local agricultural season and the spirit of replenishing whatever is lacking.

Recently, many areas have initially seen a situation of large-scale efforts in late-stage processing of wheat fields. Moreover, with unified thinking and consistent actions, achievements have been made quickly. In the Jin Southeast Prefecture, the late-stage processing of wheat fields has shifted from slow to fast, and the number of cultivated and weeded wheat fields has quickly risen to 1.4 million mu; 560,000 mu of wheat fields have received a third application of fertilizer, "late-stage topdressing"; and 270,000 mu of wheat fields have been irrigated in the later stages. Most communes have prepared the necessary medicines and machinery for preventing and controlling late-stage insect pests. On the one hand, the Party branch of Liu Village Commune in Linfen County, Jinan Plain, organized veteran farmers to explain, and on the other hand, cited examples from last year's wheat experimental fields to mobilize commune members to deliberate and discuss. Everyone realized the principle of "add 10% more effort, produce 10% more grain," and then put forward the slogan of "wheat is not harvested, processing does not stop." The commune rectified the wheat field management team and specifically stipulated a bonus system for wheat overproduction. In this way, the late-stage management of wheat fields quickly became lively and prosperous. Cadres and commune members divided responsibility areas and responsibility fields, inspecting each mu and looking at each plot, replenishing fertilizer where it was lacking, replenishing water where it was lacking, and concentrating efforts to attack three key points: attacking stalks, attacking ears, and attacking grains.

Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, 11th. The Anhui Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China held an emergency telephone conference of prefectural and municipal party secretaries on the evening of May 8 to deploy and intensify the prevention and control of wheat rust.

Comrade Zeng Xisheng, First Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, said at the meeting: Recent continuous rainy weather has caused wheat rust to develop rapidly. Everyone should learn from the lessons of the rust that occurred in 1956 and caused reduced production, pay attention to this issue, and tell the cadres of each county and commune to mobilize the broad masses of the people to do everything possible to ensure that the wheat is not affected by disaster. He pointed out: The most important methods at present are to ditch and drain water, and spray sulfur-lime mixture and native pesticides. It is also necessary to spread dry soil and ashes in the wheat fields to absorb moisture and reduce soil moisture. There are many methods for preventing and controlling rust in various places, and these experiences should be summarized and promoted. Comrade Zeng Xisheng asked the party secretaries of various places to personally inspect the places where rust has occurred, and must not be careless. In places where rust has not occurred, preparations must be made to prevent problems before they occur.

The local and municipal party committees quickly conveyed the instructions of the provincial party committee to the counties and communes through telephone conferences overnight, and promptly organized the broad masses to rush to prevent and control wheat rust. On May 9, the Liuan Prefecture mobilized 199,900 people to clear ditches and drain water for more than half of the wheat fields in the entire prefecture, and universally sprayed sulfur mixture and native pesticides. On May 9, Woyang, Mengcheng, Yingshang, and Jieshou counties in Fuyang Prefecture organized more than 8,800 professional teams to clear ditches and drain water, and cleared ditches and drained water for more than 930,000 mu of wheat fields in one day. The Fengyang County Party Committee recently established a command post for the prevention and control of wheat rust. The first secretary of the county party committee personally directed it, and transferred half of the county's section and bureau chiefs to go deep into the grassroots to divide areas and contract responsibilities, leading the masses to prevent and control wheat rust. The Su County County Party Committee of the Communist Party of China formed two teams with some of the labor force of the commune, one to prevent and control, and the other to rush to manufacture native pesticides. By adopting the method of vigorously launching mass movements to prevent and control wheat rust, good results have been achieved. At present, the wheat fields where wheat rust has occurred in all parts of the province have been sprayed with various agents once, and most have been medicated two to three times, which has played a role in suppressing the development of wheat rust.

    把后期管理坚持到底，扩大小麦增产的战果！
    多加一成工　多收一成粮
    山西集中力量攻株攻穗攻颗粒，安徽组织群众突击防治麦锈病
    本报太原11日电　山西省产麦区正在大力破除所谓“小麦已成定局、后期加工不顶大用”的论调，再接再厉地开展麦田后期管理运动。麦区农民决定从5月中旬起，在横跨5、6月的三十天中，掀起一个轰轰烈烈的踏踏实实的小麦后期加工管理的高潮，扩大小麦增产运动的战果，力争增产更多的小麦。
    目前，各产麦区领导部门经过严密部署，查田排队，调配劳力，制定具体措施和指标，使各地麦田后期加工运动越来越迅速地推开。山西省小麦主要产地晋南专区最近进行了麦田排队，全区八百二十万亩小麦中，一类麦占40％，二类麦占46％，三类麦占14％。最近，这里连续下了两场春雨，中共晋南地委要求各地抓紧雨后加工好时机，集中力量做好两项工作：一、所有麦田普遍喷磷肥，施草木灰，为落后田吃“偏饭”，坚决消灭三类田；二、坚决贯彻防倒伏措施，有条件的地区架防风架，利用竹杆拉掉株叶上的露水珠，减轻株秆负重，防止倒伏。对已倒伏的要设架扶起来，使它通风透光，正常生长。全区固定十万多人的专业队伍，从现在一直要坚持到收获，争取每亩麦田多增产二十至三十斤小麦，全区多增产两亿斤左右小麦。太行山区晋城、阳城县为了使落后麦田迎头赶上先进麦田，分别组织了万人检查团，一边检查，一边对落后田突击加工管理。晋中、晋北地区在逐步完成春播任务的同时，正陆续抽调劳力，准备开展一次为多增产小麦而战的麦田后期管理突击运动。
    今年，山西省一千六百多万亩小麦株粗叶茂，生长出色，比以往任何一年都好。晋南平原小麦普遍扬花灌浆，太行山区、晋东南专区和晋中一带小麦正在孕穗。过去小麦奇缺的雁北古长城塞上地区和晋西北吕梁山区今年首次扩大种植的春小麦，也是麦浪滚滚、一片碧绿，呈现出了丰收景象。各地农民面临着即将到来的大丰收，欢欣鼓舞，正在千方百计地巩固和扩大丰收成果。但是，各地也出现了一种认为小麦丰收已成定局，加工不加工无关紧要的说法。事实上，部分地区天气干旱，需要从多方面保证小麦后期需水量；为了保证穗大籽满颗粒大，更需要肥料营养；就防虫防风来说，虽然已取得很大成就，还需要坚持下去。总之麦田后期不是无事可做而是事很多，后期加工不是不顶事而是顶大事。因此，各级党委采取了大鸣大放大辩论和大检查大算账大发动的办法，双管齐下地解决思想问题和澄清小麦生长现状。现在各地已根据当地的农事季节和缺啥补啥的精神，进行了开展后期加工的全面大发动。
    最近以来，许多地区已初步出现了大抓大搞麦田后期加工的局面。而且思想统一，行动一致，很快就取得了成绩。晋东南专区麦田后期加工由慢转快，中耕锄麦数量很快上升到一百四十万亩；有五十六万亩麦田追施了第三次肥“后期追肥”；有二十七万亩麦田进行了后期灌溉。大部分公社防治后期虫害的药剂药械都已准备齐全。晋南平原临汾县刘村公社党支部一方面组织老农讲解，一方面引用对比了去年小麦试验田的实例，发动社员们酝酿讨论。大家认识到“多加一成工、多产一成粮”的道理，随即提出了“小麦不收，加工不休”的口号。公社整顿了麦田管理队伍，具体规定了小麦超产奖励制度。这样，麦田后期管理工作很快就热火朝天地开展起来了。干部、社员们划分责任区、责任田，亩亩查、块块看，缺肥的补肥，缺水的补水，集中力量，主攻三关：攻株、攻穗、攻颗粒。
    新华社合肥11日电　中共安徽省委于5月8日晚召开地、市委书记紧急电话会议，部署加紧防治小麦锈病的工作。
    省委第一书记曾希圣同志在会上说：近来连日阴雨，麦锈病发展很快，大家应接受1956年发生锈病而造成减产的教训，重视这个问题，并告诉各县、各公社的干部要动员广大群众千方百计地保证麦子不受灾。他指出：当前最重要的办法是开沟排水，喷施硫磺石灰合剂和土农药。还要将干土、草木灰，撒在麦地里，吸收水分，降低麦田湿度。防治锈病，各地都有很多办法，应该总结和推广这些经验。曾希圣同志要求各地党委书记对已发生锈病的地方要亲自去检查，决不能麻痹大意。锈病没有发生的地方，也要做到有备无患。
    各地、市委连夜火速将省委指示通过电话会议传达到各县、公社，并且及时组织广大群众突击防治麦锈病。六安专区在5月9日，发动十九万九千多人，对全专区一半以上的麦田进行了清沟排水，并普遍喷施了硫磺合剂和土农药。阜阳专区的涡阳、蒙城、颍上、界首四县，在5月9日，组织了八千八百多个突击清沟排水专业队，一天就开沟排水九十三万多亩麦田。凤阳县委最近成立了防治麦锈病指挥部，县委第一书记亲自指挥，并抽调全县占一半的科、局长干部深入基层划片包干，领导群众防治麦锈病。中共宿县县委将公社部分劳动力组成两套班子，一面防治，一面突击制造土农药。经过各地党委采用大搞群众运动的办法防治麦锈病，已取得良好效果。现在全省各地对发生麦锈病的麦田，已全部用各种药剂喷撒一遍，大部分已用药两遍到三遍，对抑制麦锈病的发展起了很大作用。（附图片）
