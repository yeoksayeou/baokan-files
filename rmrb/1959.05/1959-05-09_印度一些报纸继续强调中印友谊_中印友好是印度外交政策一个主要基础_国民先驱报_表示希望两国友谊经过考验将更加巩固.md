Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, May 8th. The Indian Bengali daily "Yugantar" published an editorial on the 7th regarding Prime Minister Nehru's speech in the Council of States on the 4th, emphasizing that "one of the main foundations of India's peace-loving, non-aligned foreign policy is Sino-Indian friendship."

The editorial stated that "the ideals of Panchsheel, which are widely recognized in current international relations, were first advocated in the agreement between China and India. Twenty-nine Asian and African countries accepted this ideal in Bandung and expressed their moral protest against the vicious plot of Asians fighting Asians."

The editorial emphasized that Panchsheel and "Bandung" can be said to be a declaration to safeguard peace in the East, and this declaration comes from Sino-Indian friendship. It said, "The recent deterioration of this friendship due to Tibet has in fact damaged the ideals of Panchsheel itself. People with ulterior motives have launched a propaganda campaign saying that friendship between communist and non-communist countries cannot last, and that peaceful coexistence is merely a statement. India has frequently promoted this ideal on the international stage, thereby enhancing its prestige. If this ideal is damaged, it will definitely be detrimental to India."

The editorial also said, "China also absolutely needs peace to carry out its construction. If the people's confidence in this fundamental declaration of safeguarding peace is damaged, it must also be harmful to China. And those Indians who have shown excessive enthusiasm for Tibet should also remember that only through Sino-Indian friendly relations can Tibet and the Tibetan people have true happiness. Those forces that oppose the deeply rooted ideal of peaceful coexistence, and those who attempt to gain from the rupture of Sino-Indian friendship, are not friends of Tibet."

When talking about Nehru's rejection of Pakistan's proposal for Indo-Pakistani "joint defense," the editorial said, "Many people who are enamored with Tibet will be disappointed by Nehru's firm statement." The purpose of expressing enthusiasm for Tibet—note that it is outside India—is not for the Tibetan people but for the territory of Tibet.

The newspaper said, "Those with ulterior motives are happy that the Cold War may enter India, which India has always tried to avoid. They are also happy that in the near future, as a necessary result of the Cold War, India will definitely abandon its neutrality. But Nehru disappointed those who support 'Tibetan independence,' and he firmly said that India would not fall into this trap." The newspaper believes that whether the existence of Tibet as an "independent country" is justified in history and international law is another matter. But realizing this "independence" will inevitably force India to abandon its non-aligned foreign policy, and Sino-Indian friendship will inevitably break down, which is a practical reality. Asian people who love peace and those who are truly well-intentioned towards Tibet will be relieved when they know that India will never satisfy this demand. No matter what the stakes are for Tibet and the Dalai Lama for India, India will still adhere to its non-aligned policy.

The "National Herald" on May 6th expressed support for Nehru's speech in the (Council of States) debate. It said: "There cannot be such a question that this country (India) will participate in any military alliance due to the imbalance in this region of the world. The US military treaty with Pakistan and Pakistan's participation in the alliance have not made us depart from our basic policies, nor can the development of the Tibetan situation make any changes to it."

The newspaper said: "India will continue to strive to maintain and strengthen its friendly relations with China."

Regarding China's criticism of some Indian words and deeds that interfere in China's internal affairs, the newspaper believes that "the debate in the Council of States should be considered a sufficient answer to these accusations. If these accusations continue, they must be answered again, which will be unfortunate."

The newspaper expressed hope to stop mutual accusations, and said: "Only when these accusations stop can a normal atmosphere be created to seek a solution to the Tibetan crisis. If India is asked to contribute to solving such problems, it will be happy to do so."

Xinhua News Agency, May 8th, New Delhi: Since the Tibetan rebellion, the Indian "National Herald" has repeatedly made remarks emphasizing the importance of Sino-Indian friendship and emphasizing that Tibet is a part of China.

The newspaper published an article on April 21, expressing its support for Premier Zhou Enlai's remarks on the Tibetan rebellion in his "Government Work Report" at the National People's Congress. It said that Premier Zhou Enlai said in the report, "There is no reason for the friendship between India and China and the principles guiding the relations between the two countries to be shaken by the development of the situation in Tibet. This sentence will be warmly welcomed in this country (India)."

It said, "People from all walks of life in India who sympathize with Tibet in distress place this issue within the scope of Sino-Indian friendship. There are very few exceptions. Some foreign elements have attempted to use the development of the situation in Tibet as a means to promote divisions between India and China, force India to change its non-aligned policy and participate in the Cold War. They have found that the Indian government and the vast majority of (Indian) people are determined not to change their objective state. The right of asylum granted to the Dalai Lama in this country and the statements he may make should not be the reason for the slightest wavering in Sino-Indian friendship. Mr. Zhou's repeated assurances of autonomy will help the Indian people correctly understand all aspects of the Tibetan issue."

When talking about the future social reforms in Tibet, the article said, "According to Mr. Zhou, due to the failure of the reactionary rebellion, the Tibetan people now have the opportunity to get rid of the shackles of serfdom and realize their desire for democratic autonomy and social progress. With the help of all ethnic groups in the country, they will gradually build the Tibetan plateau into a true paradise on earth. This will not only make the Tibetan people and the Chinese people extremely satisfied, but also make everyone who truly sympathizes with the Tibetan people extremely satisfied. This is Mr. Zhou's suggestion, and this is also a guarantee. There is no reason to doubt his sincerity. China has paid great attention to encouraging various ethnic groups and their cultures. There is one aspect that cannot be conceded, that is: Tibet will be regarded as a part of Chinese territory, and the security of the country cannot be relaxed. The Indian people who care about their own security will understand China's desire for security. Mr. Zhou hopes that Sino-Indian friendship will be more consolidated after the current period of testing. In this country (India), people will also widely hold this hope."

### 印度一些报纸继续强调中印友谊  中印友好是印度外交政策一个主要基础  “国民先驱报”表示希望两国友谊经过考验将更加巩固

　　印度一些报纸继续强调中印友谊
    中印友好是印度外交政策一个主要基础
    “国民先驱报”表示希望两国友谊经过考验将更加巩固
    新华社新德里8日电　印度孟加拉文日报“划时代报”7日就印度总理尼赫鲁4日在联邦院的讲话发表社论，强调指出，“印度的爱好和平的不结盟的外交政策的主要基础之一是中印友好。”
    社论说，“在目前国际关系中得到普遍承认的潘查希拉的理想，首先是在中印两国的协议中倡导的。二十九个亚非国家在万隆接受了这种理想，并且曾经表达了它们对亚洲人打亚洲人的这一狠毒阴谋的道义上的抗议。”
    社论强调潘查希拉和“万隆”可以被说成是维护东方和平的一项宣告，而这项宣告是来自中印友谊。它说，“最近由于西藏而引起的这种友谊的恶化已经在事实上损害了潘查希拉本身的理想。别有用心的人们已经发动了一个宣传运动，说共产党国家和非共产党国家之间的友谊是不可能持久的，和平共处仅仅是一种表示而已。印度在国际舞台上经常宣扬这种理想，因而使它在国际舞台上的威望得到提高。如果这种理想受到损害，是肯定不利于印度的。”
    社论又说，“中国为了进行它的建设也绝对需要和平。如果群众对这个保卫和平的根本性的声明的信心受到了损伤，对于中国也一定是有害的。而那些对西藏表现过分热心的印度人也应当记住：只有通过中印友好关系，西藏和西藏人才可能有真正的幸福。那种为正在深入人心的和平共处的理想所反对的势力，和那些企图从中印友好（关系）破裂中捞一把的势力，都不是西藏的朋友。”
    社论在谈到尼赫鲁拒绝巴基斯坦提出的关于印巴“共同防御”的建议时说，“许多钟情于西藏的人对尼赫鲁这一坚决的声明将要感到失望。”对西藏——要注意它是在印度的外面的——表示热情的目的不是为了西藏人民而是为了西藏这块地方。
    这家报纸说，“那些别有用心的人们高兴的是：冷战有可能进入印度而高兴，而冷战是印度一向竭力避免的。他们还高兴：在最近的将来，由于冷战的必然结果，印度肯定会放弃它的中立。可是尼赫鲁使这些支持‘西藏独立’的人们很失望，他坚定地说印度不会步入这个陷阱。”这家报纸认为，在历史上和国际法上，西藏作为一个“独立国家”存在是否正当，是另外一件事。但是实现（西藏的）这种“独立”，必然使印度放弃不结盟的外交政策，中印友谊必然要破裂，这却是实际的现实。亚洲爱好和平的人们和真正对西藏抱有好心肠的人，当他们知道印度永远不会满足这种要求的时候就会放心的。不管西藏和达赖喇嘛对印度来说有怎样的利害关系，印度仍将坚持它的不结盟政策。
    “国民先驱报”5月6日表示支持尼赫鲁在（联邦院）辩论中的讲话。它说：“不可能发生这样的问题：这个国家（印度）会由于世界的这一地区发生了不均衡现象而参加任何军事联盟。美国同巴基斯坦的军事条约和巴基斯坦参加联盟的政策，都没有使我们离开我们的基本政策，西藏事态的发展也不能使它有任何改变。”
    这家报纸说：“印度将继续努力保持和加强它同中国的友好关系。”
    谈到中国的舆论对印度某些干涉中国内政言行的指责时，这家报纸认为，“联邦院的辩论应该认为是对这些指责的足够的回答。如果继续进行这种指责那就必须再次给予答复，这将是不幸的。”
    这家报纸表示希望停止互相的指责，并且说：“只有当这些指责停下来的时候，才能创造一种正常的气氛来寻求解决西藏危机的办法。如果要求印度在解决这样的问题方面作出贡献的话，它是会高兴地去做的。”
    新华社8日讯　新德里消息：在西藏叛乱事件发生以来，印度“国民先驱报”曾经一再发表言论，强调中印友好的重要意义，强调西藏是中国的一部分。
    这家报纸在4月21日发表了一篇文章，表示赞成周恩来总理在全国人民代表大会会议上所作的“政府工作报告”中关于西藏叛乱事件的一些话。它说，周恩来总理在报告中说，“印中两国间的友谊和指导两国关系的原则没有理由要因为西藏的事态发展而动摇，这句话将在这个国家（印度）受到热情的欢迎。”
    它说，“对于处在困难中的西藏表示同情的印度各阶层人民是把这个问题放在中印友谊的范围以内的。例外是很少的。有些外国分子企图利用西藏的事态发展作为一种手段来促进印中之间的分歧，迫使印度改变它的不结盟政策并且参加冷战，他们已经发现，印度政府和绝大多数（印度）人民决心不改变他们的客观状态。达赖喇嘛在这个国家所得到的避难权以及他可能发表的声明，也不应该成为印中友谊发生丝毫动摇的原因。周先生一再保证自治，这种保证将帮助印度人民正确地了解西藏问题的各个方面。”
    在谈到西藏今后的社会改革的问题时，文章说，“据周先生说，由于反动派叛乱的失败，西藏人民现在已经有可能摆脱农奴制度的枷锁，实现民主自治和社会进步的愿望。他们将在全国各族人民的帮助下，逐步地把西藏高原建成一个真正的人间乐园。这不但会使西藏人民和中国人民感到极为满足，而且还会使一切真正同情西藏人民的人感到极为满意。这是周先生的建议，这也是一个保证。没有理由怀疑他的真诚。中国曾经极为注意给予各个民族和它们的文化以鼓励。在一个方面是不能让步的，那就是：西藏将被认为是中国领土的一部分，国家的安全不能放松。关心自己安全的印度人民将会了解中国对于安全的愿望，周先生希望中印友谊在经过了目前的考验时期以后将更加巩固，在这个国家（印度）里，人们也将广泛地抱有这种希望。”
