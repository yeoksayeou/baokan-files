How to Use Nitrate-Containing Soil as Fertilizer
Li Guangrui

Currently, it is the time when various crops need a large amount of fertilizer. We must do everything possible to find sources of fertilizer to promote good growth and development of crops, so as to ensure a comprehensive bumper harvest in agricultural production this year.

Our rural areas have very broad sources of fertilizer, and farmers have always had experience in collecting and applying them. Here, we will discuss how to directly apply nitrate soil as fertilizer.

Types and Distribution of Nitrate Soil

Nitrate soil is soil containing nitrates. These nitrates mainly exist in the form of potassium nitrate, sodium nitrate, and calcium nitrate. In addition to containing the two readily available nutrients, nitrogen and potassium, it also contains a certain amount of readily available phosphorus, which can be directly absorbed and utilized by crops. Therefore, it is a very good farm fertilizer.

Nitrate soil exists in provinces such as Henan, Hebei, Shanxi, Shandong, Shaanxi, Sichuan, and Hubei in China. Generally, the soil of village house sites, old wall soil, courtyard soil, toilets, stables, and city walls in rural areas contains nitrates, with more readily available nitrogen, potassium, and phosphorus. It is a fertilizer with complete three elements. As a farming proverb says: "Home soil is a tiger in the field," which is because these soils contain more effective nutrients. According to the analysis of house site soil from thirteen households in Hubei by the former Central China Agricultural Science Research Institute, each hundred dan contains an average of 13.89 jin of effective nitrogen, equivalent to 27.8 dan of human manure or 69.45 jin of ammonium sulfate, which is 60.4 times higher than general soil; at the same time, it contains 25.2 jin of effective potassium, equivalent to 630 jin of plant ash or 52.5 jin of potassium sulfate, which is 24.5 times higher than general soil; it also contains 1.71 jin of effective phosphorus, equivalent to 9.5 jin of superphosphate, which is also 7.4 times higher than general soil. Each hundred dan of old wall soil contains 9.04 jin of effective nitrogen, equivalent to 45.2 jin of ammonium sulfate, which is 39 times higher than general soil; it contains 9.36 jin of effective potassium, equivalent to 19.5 jin of potassium sulfate, which is 9 times higher than general soil; although the content of effective phosphorus is less, it is also 3 times higher than general soil. Courtyard soil also contains more readily available nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium. According to analysis, each kilogram of courtyard soil contains 199 to 1222 milligrams of readily available nitrogen, which is about 13 to 44 times higher than the cotton field soil in the same area; it contains 95 to 170 milligrams of readily available phosphorus, which is about 2 to 6 times higher than general soil; it contains 1418 to 1588 milligrams of readily available potassium, which is about 20 to 26 times higher than general field. The wall soil and road soil in the north also contain certain readily available nutrients, which can be used as fertilizer.

The effective nutrients contained in the above-mentioned various soils mainly exist in the form of nitrates. The accumulation of these readily available nutrients is closely related to the role of nitrifying bacteria. Because organic matter in the soil can only generate nitrates through the action of microorganisms, especially nitrifying bacteria. These nitrates rise to the soil surface with capillary water and accumulate within 3 to 10 centimeters of the topsoil (the topsoil of pig and cattle sheds and toilets has more fertilizer and the accumulated soil layer is even thicker). At the same time, children's and poultry feces and sewage often seep into the ground in the house, which increases the fertility of the topsoil over time. Also, because the topsoil and old wall soil are indoors, the soil temperature and humidity do not change much, which is suitable for the activity of nitrifying bacteria, so the nitrate in the soil is generated quickly; the generated nitrate will not be washed away by rainwater, so the nitrate in the soil accumulates more and more. Also, because the nitric acid produced by nitrification can dissolve the insoluble phosphorus and potassium elements in the soil and convert them into a state that plants can easily absorb, the above-mentioned nitrate-containing soil not only contains more nitrate nitrogen, but also has a considerable amount of readily available phosphorus and potassium nutrients.

In addition to the fact that the topsoil and old wall soil contain more or less nitrate, it is particularly worth mentioning that nitrate soil layers have also been found to accumulate in the soil profiles of some fertile areas. For example, a nitrate soil layer is accumulated in the loess soil profile of the Guanzhong Plain in Shaanxi. According to our investigation with Soviet fertilizer expert Professor Naikin in the Hongqi People's Commune and Wugong Yangling People's Commune in Sanyuan County, Shaanxi Province last October, this nitrate soil layer is generally distributed between 100 cm and 130 cm below the topsoil, and some are above 80 cm or below 150 cm. From the soil profile, it can be clearly seen that this layer of soil is about 15 to 30 centimeters thick, appears particularly moist, and has a deep color, with a clear difference from the topsoil and subsoil.

The late soil science professor Lan Mengjiu of Northwest Agricultural College studied this nitrate soil layer in 1951. According to his analysis, the salt deposits under the red clay layer of Wugong soil (70 to 80 cm deep from the surface) contain more dinitrogen pentoxide. If converted into sodium nitrate, it is 2.74%. The sodium nitrate content under the lime nodule layer in the same area also reached 1.806%; the soil at the animal burrows in these soil layers contains 0.959% sodium nitrate and 0.718% potassium nitrate, totaling 1.677%. According to Professor Lan Mengjiu's research, it seems certain that there are more nitrate accumulations under the red clay layer and lime nodule layer of the soil of the first and second terraces in Guanzhong Plain, as well as along animal burrows. This shows that in the nitrate soil layer in this area, each hundred jin of soil contains 1.677 to 2.74 jin of sodium nitrate or potassium nitrate, equivalent to 1.3 to 2.06 jin of ammonium sulfate. The soil layer below each mu of land contains about 300,000 to 600,000 jin of such soil, and the nitrogen content is equivalent to 3,900 to 12,360 jin of ammonium sulfate. What a remarkable source of fertilizer this is! However, the salt deposits on the loess cliffs and at the foot of the soil banks in the same area do not contain nitrate at all, and the nitrate content in the latter is also very low. From the analysis results, this cliff soil layer has no fertilizer value at all.

The reason for the accumulation of nitrate under the soil in Guanzhong is mainly because farmers have continuously applied organic fertilizers to the surface soil for many years. Plant remains and animal excrement are gradually converted into nitrates through the decomposition and nitrification of nitrogen-fixing bacteria, ammonifying bacteria, and nitrifying bacteria. They are leached down by rainwater or irrigation water. At the same time, they are also affected by the dissolution of groundwater and upward movement along soil capillaries during drought. Therefore, nitrate gradually accumulates in the soil layer about one meter above and below the ground under the force of these two opposing directions, forming the current nitrate soil layer.

In addition, the nitrate soil used for making firecrackers in Kaifeng, Henan, also contains 1.75% potassium nitrate and 0.85% magnesium nitrate. Nitrate soil has also been found in southern Xinjiang, which is called "Xiaoer soil" by local farmers. It contains more readily available nitrogen and potassium, and southern Xinjiang has begun to apply it widely. In other fertile areas or ancient towns, as well as some humid and dark caves, the soil also contains a large amount of nitrate due to the existence of animal feces and urine (such as bat feces in caves) and organic nitrogen-containing substances (at the same time, rainwater cannot wash it away). It can be used to fertilize fields under the decomposition of a large number of nitrogen-fixing bacteria and nitric acid bacteria.

Ways to Identify Nitrate Soil

As mentioned above, the nitrates in nitrate-containing soil mainly exist in the form of potassium nitrate and sodium nitrate. These two nitrates are produced by complex bacterial action and chemical processes, and its formation conditions can be summarized as:

	(1) There must be products after the decomposition of nitrogen-containing organic matter in the soil;
	(2) The soil contains alkali, or is alkaline or slightly alkaline soil;
	(3) Contact with a large amount of air and water;
	(4) Suitable temperature conditions, 25 to 35 degrees Celsius.

Among these conditions, the first one is the most important, and air and temperature can promote the progress of its complex process. Therefore, in general, the base of old walls, the soil of the floor in the house, empty courtyards, and places that are humid and cannot be washed by rainwater can generate nitrate soil because there is nitrogen-containing organic matter.

Since potassium nitrate and sodium nitrate are highly soluble in water, nitrate-containing soil is relatively moist. The nitrate in the soil in high mountains is easily washed away by mountain torrents and brought into lakes and rivers. The nitrate in the plains seeps into the soil after rain, and when the weather is sunny, the nitrate rises to the ground due to capillary action and evaporation of water by sunlight, so there is more nitrate soil in the plains than in mountainous areas.

However, it must be pointed out here that there are two types of nitrate soil, one is fire nitrate soil and the other is skin nitrate soil. The above-mentioned various types of readily available nitrogen and potassium-containing soils are all fire nitrate soil. It has a bitter, spicy, and numb taste, and has a salty taste, especially spicy is good nitrate soil. Nitrate-containing soil is different from nitrate-free soil. Nitrate soil is moist and cannot be dried by the sun, and it turns slightly purplish-red after being exposed to the sun. Most nitrate-containing soil is crisp, damp, and has falling soil surface, and the particles are in the shape of ant droppings. Nitrate-free soil is white and dry.

Skin nitrate soil is soil containing mirabilite (ie, sodium sulfate). The most common place is river beach, and the surface is white powder (not needle-shaped transparent body). The main taste is salty and cool. Skin nitrate soil does not have nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium nutrients and cannot be used as fertilizer to avoid causing soil salinization.

How to Use Nitrate Soil to Fertilize?

The methods of using various nitrate-containing soils to fertilize fields are: first, dig it out and directly apply it to the fields. In many places, during the season when crops urgently need fertilizer, old walls are replaced, topsoil is dug up, bottoms of pens are removed, and gutters are scraped. The soil dug out is immediately applied to the fields, and the effect of increasing production is very significant. Last year, in the Xiangyang area of Hubei, many agricultural cooperatives adopted this method to solve the top dressing in the seedling stage. The advantage of this method is that the source of fertilizer is large and the quantity is large, and it can achieve great results without processing. Moreover, digging the soil and applying it to the field at the same time avoids the evaporation or loss of effective nutrients during the accumulation process.

The second is to use nitrate soil to mix with plant ash, soak and extract and concentrate to produce potassium nitrate, which is used as fertilizer. The potassium nitrate produced in this way is a white transparent, long pyramidal crystal, generally containing 14% nitrogen and 45% potassium oxide. It is a good nitrogen and potassium compound fertilizer. It can also be used to manufacture black explosives, fireworks, etc. It is also a good preservative and raw material for manufacturing glass.

Since very pure potassium nitrate minerals found in nature are very few and cannot meet the needs. Therefore, people have known for a long time to use the ancient wall nitrate soil and plant ash to extract potassium nitrate. Chinese farmers have rich experience in this regard.

As for the nitrate soil layer buried under the soil, it can be reasonably used according to the local specific conditions. If there are no signs of salinization on the surface soil and the nitrate soil layer is close to the ground, consider combining deep plowing to turn up the lower soil with more nitrate nitrogen to the surface as fertilizer. This will play a huge role in expanding fertilizer sources and further increasing local crop yields. You can also use the nitrate soil layer exposed in the section to dig nitrate soil nearby and apply it to the ground. Farmers in Guanzhong, Shaanxi, often use this soil to pad stable pens to make soil manure. They have unconsciously used this nitrate salt, but after the nitrate salt comes into contact with fresh livestock manure and urine, the nitrate nitrogen is partially reduced and lost; most of it is consumed by microbial reproduction; and it is greatly lost in the open-air accumulation process, and there is little effect.

If the surface soil has salinization and the nitrate soil layer also contains a lot of salt, it can not be directly applied. It can be mixed with plant ash, soaked and extracted and concentrated to separate the salt and produce pure potassium nitrate for application. At the same time, the byproduct brine of making potassium nitrate also contains 2%-5% effective nitrogen and about 3% soluble potassium, which can also be used as fertilizer.

In addition, the following points must also be paid attention to when directly applying nitrate soil to fertilize fields:

	(1) When applying nitrate-containing soil, it should be combined with the application of organic fertilizer, and neither should be neglected. Because nitrate soil contains readily available nitrogen and soluble potassium, but does not contain or contains very little organic matter, it has no effect on cultivating soil fertility. Therefore, nitrate-containing soil must be applied in combination with slow-release fertilizers such as pig and cattle manure and compost, so that the fertilizer effect is both fast and lasting. At the same time, phosphate fertilizer should also be applied in combination.
	(2) Paddy fields are prone to nitrate reduction due to lack of air after nitrate soil is applied, resulting in volatilization loss; at the same time, paddy fields are often irrigated and drained, and nitrate nitrogen is most easily lost. Therefore, nitrate soil is best used in dry land. Wheat, cotton, hemp, tobacco, miscellaneous grains, vegetables, etc. can be applied. The amount used at one time in dry land should not be too much, so as not to cause the crops to fail to absorb it fully in time, and the nutrients will penetrate and lose from the soil; or absorb too much at one time, causing crazy growth. The amount used each time in paddy fields should not be too much, and do not drain water immediately after application.
	(3) The nutrients contained in nitrate soil can dissolve in water and quickly exert fertilizer effect, so it is suitable for top dressing.
	(4) It is best to pile up various nitrate-containing soils indoors, or apply them to the fields as soon as they are dug out, to avoid volatilization loss. If piled outdoors, it must be covered.

    怎样利用含硝泥土作肥料
    李光锐
    目前，正是各种庄稼需要大量肥料的时候，千方百计寻找肥源，促使作物得到良好的生长发育，才能保证今年农业生产全面大丰收。
    我国各地农村有着非常广阔的肥源，农民群众向来有采集施用的经验。这里所谈的是如何利用硝土来直接施肥。
    硝土的种类及其分布
    硝土是含有硝酸盐的土壤。这种硝酸盐主要以硝酸钾、硝酸钠及硝酸钙的形式存在。它里面除了含有氮、钾两种速效养分以外，还有的含有一定数量的速效磷，这些都可以直接供作物吸收利用，所以是一种很好的农家肥料。
    硝土在我国河南、河北、山西、山东、陕西、四川、湖北等省都有。大凡农村庄户地皮土、老墙土、院土、厕所、厩圈及城墙等低处的泥土都含有硝酸盐，里面有着较多的速效氮、钾和磷酸，是一种三要素完备的肥料。农谚说：
  “家里土，地里虎。”就是因为这些土里含有较多的有效养分的缘故。根据前华中农业科学研究所在湖北对十三户的地皮土分析，每百担平均含有效氮十三点八九斤，相当人粪尿二十七点八担，或硫酸铵六十九点四五斤，比一般土壤高六十点四倍；同时含有效钾二十五点二斤，相当草木灰六百三十斤，或硫酸钾五十二点五斤，比一般土壤高二十四倍半；还含有效磷一点七一斤，相当过磷酸钙九斤半，也比一般土壤高七点四倍。陈墙土每百担含有效氮九点零四斤，相当硫酸铵四十五点二斤，比一般土壤高三十九倍；含有效钾九点三六斤，相当硫酸钾十九斤半，比一般土壤高九倍；有效磷含量虽然较少，但比一般土壤也高三倍。院土也含有较多的速效氮磷钾，据分析每公斤院土含速效氮一百九十九至一千二百二十二毫克，比同一地方的棉田土壤约高十三至四十四倍；含速效磷九十五至一百七十毫克，比一般土约高二至六倍多；含速效钾一千四百十八至一千五百八十八毫克，比一般田约高二十至二十六倍。北方的墙土、道土也都含有一定的速效养分，都可以用作肥料。
    上述各种泥土所含有效养分主要以硝酸盐形式存在。这种速效养分的累积与硝化细菌的作用有密切关系。因为土壤中有机质只有经过微生物，特别是硝化细菌的作用，才能生成硝酸盐类。这些硝酸盐随着毛细管水上升带到土壤表层，就聚积在表土三至十厘米以内（猪、牛舍及厕所的地皮土肥分较多，聚积的土层还要更厚一些）。同时屋内地上常有小孩、家禽粪尿及污水渗入，日积月累也增加了地皮土的肥分。又因为地皮土和陈墙土都在屋内，土壤温度和湿度变化不大，适合硝化细菌的活动，于是土中的硝便生成的很快；所生成的硝又不会被雨水淋洗冲走，这样土中的硝就愈积愈多。又由于硝化作用所产生的硝酸，能将土中难溶性磷、钾元素溶解，转化为植物容易吸收的状态，所以上述含有硝酸盐的泥土中不仅含有较多的硝酸态氮，而且速效磷钾养分也相当多。
    除了地皮土、陈墙土等含有或多或少的硝酸盐以外，特别值得提出的是有些肥沃地区的土壤剖面中也发现累积有硝酸盐土层。例如陕西关中平原黄土性土壤剖面就有一个硝酸盐土层。据我们去年10月陪苏联肥料专家纳依金教授在陕西三原县红旗人民公社及武功杨陵人民公社等地考察，看到这个硝酸盐土层一般分布在距表土一百厘米以下至一百三十厘米之间，也有在八十厘米以上或一百五十厘米以下的。从土壤剖面可以清楚地看出，这一层土壤约有十五至三十多厘米厚，显得特别潮湿，颜色很深，同表土、底土有着鲜明的差别。
    西北农学院已故土壤学教授蓝梦九，在1951年曾对这个硝酸盐土层作过研究。根据他的分析结果，在武功土壤红色粘土层下（距地表深七十至八十厘米）的盐积物含有较多的五氧化二氮，如果换算成硝酸钠，则有2.74％。在同一地区土壤石灰结核层下的硝酸钠含量也达1.806％；在这些土层动物穴口的土壤含硝酸钠0.959％，硝酸钾0.718％，两者合计占1.677％。根据蓝梦九教授的研究，似乎可以肯定在关中平原各县头道塬和二道塬土壤的红色粘土层下，与石灰结核层下，以及沿动物洞穴处皆有较多含量的硝酸盐积聚。这说明在这一带地方的硝酸盐土层，每百斤土壤就含有一点六七七至二点七四斤硝酸钠或硝酸钾，相当一点三至二点零六斤硫酸铵，每亩土地下面约有三十至六十万斤这样的土层，所含氮素相当于硫酸铵三千九百至一万二千三百六十斤。这是一个多么了不起的大肥源！但在同一地区黄土崖上与土岸脚下的盐积物，前者根本不含硝酸盐，后者含硝酸盐亦极少，从分析结果看，这种崖岸土层毫无肥料价值可言。
    在关中土壤下面积聚硝酸盐的原因主要是劳动农民在很多年以来，在表层土壤连续施用有机肥料，植物遗体和动物排泄物经过固氮菌、氨化菌、硝酸菌的分解和硝化作用的进行，逐渐生成一部分硝酸盐，随雨水或灌溉水淋溶沉降而下，同时在干旱时期又受地下水溶解沿土壤毛细管向上移动的影响，于是硝酸盐在这两种方向相反的力量迫使下，逐渐在距地面一米上下的土层里聚积起来，形成现在的硝酸盐土层。
    此外，在河南开封一带制火硝所用的硝土也含有1.75％的硝酸钾和0.85％的硝酸镁。在新疆南部也发现有硝土，当地农民称为“硝尔土”，它里面含有较多的速效性氮和钾，南疆已经开始广泛施用。在其他肥沃地区或古老城镇，以及有些潮湿阴暗的山洞，因有动物的粪尿（如山洞的蝙蝠粪）和有机含氮物质的存在（同时雨水又淋洗不到），在大量的固氮菌和硝酸细菌的分解作用下，使那里的泥土也含有大量的硝，可用以肥田。
    识别硝土的办法
    如上所述，含硝泥土中的硝酸盐主要以硝酸钾和硝酸钠的形式存在。这两种硝化物都是由于复杂的细菌作用和化学过程而生成的，它的形成条件可以概括为：
      （一）土壤中必须有含氮有机物质分解后的产物存在；
      （二）土壤中含有碱，或是碱性与微碱性土壤；
      （三）与大量的空气和水分接触；
      （四）适宜的温度条件，摄氏二十五至三十五度。
    在这些条件中以第一条为最重要，而空气与温度则能促进其复杂过程的进行，所以一般陈年的墙脚，屋内地皮土，空院以及阴湿而雨水淋洗不到的地方，因为这里有含氮有机物质的存在，故能生成硝土。
    由于硝酸钾及硝酸钠在水中的溶解度都大，所以含硝的泥土都比较潮湿。高山泥土中的硝，因易随山洪流水冲走，带入湖泊河流中。平地的硝，下雨后渗入泥土，天晴又由于毛细管作用及阳光照射水分蒸发，使硝上升地面，所以平地较山区硝土多。
    但是这里必须指出，硝土有两种，一种是火硝土，另一种是皮硝土。上述各种含有速效氮、钾养分的都属于火硝土。它具有一种苦、辣、麻味，并带有咸味，特别发辣的则是好硝土。凡含有硝的泥土与无硝的泥土不同，硝土潮湿，经太阳晒不干，太阳晒后稍变紫红色。有硝的土，大多数发酥、起潮、落土面子，颗粒呈蚂蚁粪状。无硝的土颜色发白，发干。
    皮硝土则为含有芒硝（即硫酸钠）的土，最多的地方是河滩，表面为白色粉状（而不是针状透明体），主要为咸味、凉味。皮硝土没有氮、磷、钾养分，不可作为肥料施用，以免引起土壤盐渍化。
    怎样用硝土来施肥？
    利用各种含有硝酸盐泥土肥田的办法有：第一是起出直接上田。不少地方在庄稼紧急需肥季节，换老墙、挖地皮、起圈底、刮阴沟，这样起出的泥土立即上到田里，增产效果都非常显著。去年湖北襄阳地区小麦大面积丰收，不少农业社是采用这种办法解决苗期的追肥。这样作的好处是：肥料来源多，数量大，不需加工就能见到大的效果。而且一边起土一边上田也避免了堆积过程挥发或流失有效养分。
    第二是把硝土用来与草木灰混合浸提浓缩，制取硝酸钾，作为肥料施用。这样制成的硝酸钾为白色透明、长棱锥状晶体，一般含氮14％，含氧化钾45％，是一种很好的氮、钾复合化肥，也可以用来制造黑色炸药、花炮等，又是好的防腐剂和制造玻璃的原料。
    由于大自然中被发现的较纯的硝酸钾矿很少，远不能满足需要。所以很久以前人们就知道利用古老的墙脚硝土和草木灰提炼硝酸钾，我国农民对这一点有丰富的经验。
    至于埋藏在土壤下面的硝酸盐土层，可以根据当地具体情况加以合理的利用。如果表层土壤没有盐渍化的迹象，且硝酸盐土层距地面较近，可以考虑结合深耕翻起下层含硝酸态氮素较多的土壤到表层作肥料施用，这对于扩大肥源，进一步提高当地作物产量将会起到巨大的作用。也可以利用地段露出的硝土层，就近掘取硝土上地。陕西关中农民常采用此土垫厩圈制土粪之用，无形中已采用此硝盐，但是硝盐与新鲜牲畜粪尿接触后，硝酸态氮即已部分被还原而损失；其大部分被微生物繁殖所消耗；且在露天堆积过程，风吹日晒雨淋损失很大，少有效果。
    如果表层土壤有盐渍化现象，硝酸盐土层又含有大量盐分，可不直接施用，可用它与草木灰混合浸提浓缩，分离盐分，制出较纯的硝酸钾施用。同时制硝酸钾的副产品卤水也含有2％—5％的有效氮及3％左右的可溶性钾，也可以作肥料施用。
    此外，直接施用硝土肥田时还必须注意以下几点：
      （1）施用含硝泥土时要结合施有机肥料，二者不可偏废。因为硝土虽含有速效氮及可溶性钾，但不含或很少含有机物，对培养土壤肥力没有作用，故必须把含硝泥土与猪牛栏粪、堆肥等迟效肥料结合施用，这样肥效既来得快，又能持久。同时还应配合施用磷肥。
      （2）水田由于缺乏空气，硝土施后容易引起硝酸还原作用，造成挥发损失；同时水田经常灌水、排水，硝酸态氮最易流失，因此硝土最好用在旱地。小麦、棉、麻、烟、杂粮、蔬菜等都可以施用。在旱地一次用量不宜过多，以免作物来不及充分吸收，养分即会从土壤渗透流失；或一时吸收过多，发生疯长。在水田每次用量更不宜多，施后不要立即排水。
      （3）硝土所含养分能够溶解于水，迅速发挥肥效，因此宜作追肥施用。
      （4）挖出各种含硝泥土最好堆在室内，或随起出随上田，以免挥发损失。如果堆在室外，必须加以覆盖。
