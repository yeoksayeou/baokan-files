Xinhua News Agency, May 9th: Our correspondent's summary of the current situation on the steel front says: Recently, China's steel production has gradually increased, and the speed of the increase has been higher every ten days. Steel production in mid-April increased by 3.7% compared with the first ten days of the month, and increased by another 6.2% in the last ten days of the month compared with mid-April; the production of pig iron and steel products is also gradually increasing.

From the current situation, rapidly strengthening the iron production link will promote the continued increase in the production of steel and steel products as soon as possible. The current situation of the leap forward in the iron and steel industry is: where there is iron, there is steel. The speed of the entire iron and steel industry's leap forward largely depends on the speed of pig iron growth.

The relevant departments of the Central Government and various provinces, cities, and autonomous regions are currently working intensely on the raw materials, production, and allocation of pig iron to create conditions for the continued growth of steel production.

Regarding the issue of raw materials and fuel for ironmaking, the competent authorities believe that, in addition to the need for the coal department to fully supply high-quality coking coal, it is necessary to immediately take measures to increase the production and quality of ore (including iron ore, manganese ore, and refractory material ore) and increase ore transportation capacity. Currently, what is particularly important is to improve the quality of ore, especially the quality of iron ore. This is because the quality of ore has a very significant relationship with the output and quality of pig iron, the utilization coefficient of the blast furnace, the consumption of coke, and the amount of ore transported. China's iron ore production this year is measured in tens of millions of tons. If some ores have very low iron content or are mixed with rubble, it means that a large number of trains, automobiles, and manpower must be used to transport large amounts of stones, and a large number of blast furnaces and coke must be used to melt large amounts of stones, resulting in a small amount of low-quality pig iron. This is a slow, poor, and wasteful method of ore production. Now, the quality of the vast majority of ore is good, but some ore is not good enough. If the quality of all iron ore meets the requirements for ironmaking, it would be equivalent to increasing the production of a large amount of ore, saving a large amount of transportation capacity and coke, and enabling the same number of blast furnace equipment to produce more and better pig iron. This is a method of producing ore that is more, faster, better, and more economical.

In order to ensure the quality of ore, the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry requires mines in various regions to select iron ore with a grade that meets the requirements of ironmaking for mining, classify it according to quality after mining, and manually remove rubble. At the same time, it requires provinces such as Hebei, Jiangsu, Shandong, Anhui, and Sichuan to produce more iron ore for open-hearth steelmaking. This is because a large part of this year's steel production relies on open-hearth production, and this type of ore is directly related to completing this year's production tasks. The Ministry of Metallurgical Industry has called on mining workers across the country: "Do not let waste rock leave the mine."

Quickly transporting the produced ore to the railway line is the key point that needs to be grasped urgently and is being prominently grasped in the current ore transportation work. The State Economic Commission recently held a meeting to specifically arrange the transportation of ore. Some provinces with heavy ore production tasks have listed the transportation of ore as a priority for transportation. The Ministry of Metallurgical Industry has also allocated light rails that can be laid for 660 kilometers to 42 key mines for the construction of light railways, and requires relevant provinces and cities to quickly build roadbeds and prepare mine cars, sleepers, and spikes so that when the rails arrive, the road is completed, and ore can be transported immediately.

The central issue of pig iron production is to focus on technology in a down-to-earth manner and increase the utilization coefficient of blast furnaces and the daily output level of pig iron. In terms of the production of large and medium-sized blast furnaces, Benxi Iron and Steel Plant No. 1 has created the nation's most advanced blast furnace utilization coefficient, maintaining it above 2.2 for more than four months this year. The problem now is how those blast furnaces with utilization coefficients stuck below 1 or around 1.3 can learn from Benxi's experience and catch up quickly.

The workers of small blast furnaces across the country are also currently attacking technical barriers, turning the production of small blast furnaces from a state of high coke ratio, high cost, low output, and low quality to a state of low coke ratio, low cost, high output, and high quality. Small blast furnaces in Hebei, Anhui, Shandong, Jiangsu, Jiangxi, Guizhou, Sichuan, and other places have achieved significant technical experience in the production of small blast furnaces in the high-yield, high-quality red flag competition. Hebei Province has adopted the method of increasing the air volume of centralized blowers and raising the air temperature to 600 to 700 degrees, and the sulfur content of pig iron produced by small blast furnaces in the province has been significantly reduced. The average utilization coefficient of small blast furnaces in Shandong Province has also increased significantly. Some small blast furnaces in Jiangxi Province have simultaneously adopted technical measures such as selecting ore, reducing coke ash content, conducting multi-nozzle combustion, and increasing smelting intensity, and their utilization coefficient has reached and exceeded the standard proposed by the Ministry of Metallurgical Industry (producing one ton of iron per cubic meter of blast furnace volume per day and night), and some have reached two tons. This kind of small blast furnace red flag is not only present in one place and one furnace, but also flying high in many areas and many furnace groups. This year, pig iron produced by small blast furnaces accounts for about half of the country's total pig iron production. Therefore, seriously summarizing, learning, and promoting the advanced experience of small blast furnace production has the same significant economic significance as promoting advanced experience in large and medium-sized blast furnaces. The Ministry of Metallurgical Industry has dispatched more than 600 technicians to various parts of the country to provide technical guidance, help various regions summarize and promote advanced experience, and enable small blast furnaces to play a greater role in this year's battle for steel.

In terms of the allocation of pig iron, many provinces and enterprises have implemented the spirit of "the whole country as one chessboard" and resolutely transferred pig iron according to the national plan. In April, Anhui, Jiangsu, Fujian, and other provinces, as well as Shijingshan, Benxi, Longyan, and other steel companies, completed or overfulfilled their allocation plans; Shandong, Sichuan, and Zhejiang also completed them relatively well. Recently, provinces and cities with the task of transferring pig iron held another meeting on iron transfer and further took measures. Shandong Province, which has a large task of transferring pig iron, has designated special personnel from the Provincial Party Committee and the Prefectural Party Committee to be responsible for the transfer of pig iron. Hebei Province has formulated management methods for pig iron, stipulating that pig iron produced by blast furnaces throughout the province will be under the unified management and allocation of the province as soon as it leaves the furnace, and the Provincial Party Committee has also designated special personnel to supervise. Sichuan Province divides pig iron into three categories according to quality, and the first and second categories (good iron) are transferred to the Central Government, and more than 100 people form nine quality inspection teams for pig iron transfer, which are sent to the pig iron production areas to supervise, and pig iron that does not meet the standards is not allowed to be loaded into the train. Sichuan Province has also organized a professional transportation team to ensure that pig iron is transported to railway lines or docks as soon as possible. The leading organs of various provinces, cities, and autonomous regions have emphasized resolutely implementing the spirit of "the whole country as one chessboard," prioritizing the country over the locality, prioritizing external transfer over internal use, and completing the national iron transfer plan with quality and quantity.

　　全国一盘棋　促铁为保钢
    各地大力加强生铁生产调运保证钢产量跃进
    新华社9日讯　本社记者综述当前钢铁战线的情况说：近来我国钢铁的产量逐步上升，上升的速度也一旬高过一旬。钢产量4月中旬比上旬增长3.7％，下旬又比中旬增长6.2％；生铁和钢材的产量，也在逐步上升着。
    从目前的情况看，迅速加强铁的生产这一环节，就会尽快地促进钢和钢材的产量继续上升。当前钢铁工业跃进的形势是：有铁就有钢。整个钢铁工业跃进的速度，在很大程度上取决于生铁增长的速度。
    中央有关部门和各省、市、自治区，目前正在从生铁的原料、生产、调拨三个方面进行紧张的工作，为钢产量继续增长创造条件。
    关于炼铁原料和燃料的问题，主管部门认为，除去需要煤炭部门充分供应优质的炼焦用煤以外，需要立即采取措施提高矿石的产量和质量（包括铁矿、锰矿和耐火材料矿石），并且增加矿石的运输能力。目前特别重要的是提高矿石质量，尤其是提高铁矿石的质量。因为矿石的质量，对于生铁的产量和质量、高炉的利用系数、焦炭的消耗和矿石的运输量这四个方面，都有着极为重大的关系。我国今年铁矿石的产量是以千万吨计的，如果矿石中有些含铁量很低或掺有杂石，那就意味着要用大量的火车汽车和人力运大量的石头，用大量的高炉和焦炭熔化大量的石头，而得到的却是量少质劣的生铁。这是矿石生产中少慢差费的方法。现在绝大部分的矿石的质量是好的，但是也有少部分矿石不够好。如果所有铁矿石的质量都合乎炼铁要求，那就等于增产大量的矿石，节省大量的运输能力和焦炭，就可以用同样多的高炉设备炼出更多更好的生铁。这是矿石生产中多快好省的方法。
    为了保证矿石的质量，冶金部要求各地矿山选择矿石品位合乎炼铁要求的铁矿进行开采，采后要按质量分级和经过手选清出杂石。同时要求河北、江苏、山东、安徽和四川等省更多地生产平炉炼钢掺用的铁矿石。这是因为今年的钢产量有很大一部分是靠平炉生产的，这种矿石直接关系着完成今年的生产任务。冶金部已经号召全国采矿的职工：“不让废石出矿山”。
    把生产出来的矿石迅速运到铁路线上，这是当前矿石运输工作方面需要抓紧而且正在突出地抓的重点。国家经济委员会最近召开了会议，具体安排了矿石的运输工作。生产矿石任务重的一些省，已把运矿石列为优先运输的物资。冶金工业部也拨出了可铺设六百六十公里的轻轨，供给四十二个重点矿山修建轻便铁路，并且要求有关省市迅速修路基，准备矿车、枕木和道钉等，以便将来轨到路成，立即运矿石。
    生铁生产的中心问题是踏踏实实地抓技术，提高高炉的利用系数和生铁的日产水平。在大中型高炉的生产方面，本溪第一钢铁厂已经创造了高炉利用系数的全国最先进的成绩，今年四个多月以来一直保持在二点二以上。现在的问题是那些利用系数停在一以下或一点三左右的高炉如何学习本溪的经验，迅速地赶上去。
    全国各地小高炉的职工们，目前也在猛攻技术关，使小高炉的生产从焦比高、成本高、产量低、质量低的状况变为焦比低、成本低、产量高、质量高。河北、安徽、山东、江苏、江西、贵州、四川等地的小高炉，在高产优质红旗竞赛中，已经取得了小高炉生产方面重大的技术经验。河北省采用集中鼓风机加大风量和把风温提高到六百至七百度的方法，全省小高炉生产的生铁的含硫量已显著降低。山东省全省小高炉的平均利用系数也有显著的增长。江西省有些小高炉同时采用了精选矿石、降低焦炭灰分、进行多嘴燃烧和提高冶炼强度等技术措施，利用系数已达到和超过了冶金部提出的标准（每立方公尺高炉容积每昼夜产铁一吨），有的达到了二吨。这种小高炉的红旗，不只是一地一炉有，而是在许多地区许多炉群上高高飘扬。今年小高炉生产的生铁占全国生铁总产量的一半左右，因此，认真总结、学习和推广小高炉生产的先进经验，同在大中型高炉推广先进经验具有同等重大的经济意义。冶金部已派出六百多技术人员，分赴全国各地，进行技术指导，帮助各地总结和推广先进经验，使小高炉在今年的夺钢大战中发挥更大的作用。
    在生铁的调拨方面，很多省和企业都贯彻了“全国一盘棋”的精神，坚决按照国家计划外调生铁。4月份安徽、江苏、福建等省和石景山、本溪、龙烟等钢铁公司，都完成或超额完成了调拨计划；山东、四川和浙江等省也完成得比较好。最近，有外调生铁任务的省市又举行了调铁的会议，进一步采取了措施。外调生铁任务很大的山东省，中共省委和地委都指定了专人负责外调生铁的工作。河北省制定了生铁的管理办法，规定全省高炉生产的生铁一出炉就归省统一管理调拨，省委并且指定专人监督。四川省把生铁按质量分为三类，一类、二类（好铁）调中央，并且由一百多人组成九个调运生铁质量检查团，分赴生铁产地监督，不合标准的生铁一律不准装车。四川省还组织了专业运输队，保证尽快地把生铁运到铁路沿线或码头。各省、市、自治区领导机关都强调坚决贯彻“全国一盘棋”的精神，先国家后地方，先外后内，按质按量完成国家的调铁计划。
