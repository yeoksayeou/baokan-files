Let the Eight Thousand Li of Rivers and Streams Be Open to Boats
Qiu Xianzong, Deputy Director of the Sichuan Provincial Department of Transportation

Fully utilizing all rivers to develop water transport is a strategy Sichuan Province has proposed based on its unique natural conditions. In Sichuan Province's 570,000 square kilometers of land, more than 400 rivers and streams, large and small, crisscross, totaling over 80,000 li in length. From the marginal mountain areas to the heartland, from cities to villages, rivers are evenly distributed, with ample water sources and year-round navigability. At present, the province has over 13,200 kilometers of formally navigable waterways, with the Yangtze River as the main trunk and the Jialing River, Tuo River, Min River, and Wu River as branches, forming a comprehensive natural water transport network.

In Sichuan's inland river shipping, besides the Yangtze and Jialing Rivers which use some steamboats for transport, the main reliance is on wooden boat transport. In 1958, the freight volume completed by wooden boats throughout the province accounted for about 40% of the total volume of various transportation tools. The characteristics of inland river transport are large capacity and low cost. A small river tributary that only allows the passage of wooden boats with a load of ten tons is equivalent to the transportation capacity of a highway; and the cost of wooden boat transport is only one-third of the cost of motor transport. For a large province like Sichuan, inland river transport not only undertakes long-distance trunk line transport tasks, but is also an important tool for the short-distance collection and distribution of goods for trains, ships, and automobiles. Therefore, fully utilizing abundant water resources to develop inland river transport is of even greater significance.

Although Sichuan's rivers are navigable year-round, there are many shoals, rapid currents, and hidden reefs, resulting in very low transport efficiency. After liberation, we carried out large-scale management and opening up of waterways, turning water hazards into water benefits. In particular, in 1958, the broad masses of the rural areas, in conjunction with water conservancy construction, mobilized the masses to conquer dangerous shoals, blast away reefs, and dredge waterways in a very short period of time. They opened up 56 small river tributaries, such as the Dacheng River, Simeng River, Mengxi River, Madu River, Yangxi River, Yanzi River, and Tongkou River, totaling more than 1,100 kilometers in length. The management and opening of these rivers provided convenient transportation conditions for guaranteeing the great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production. The Longshui District of Dazu County organized a 4,000-strong water management army, and in a very short period of time, managed 30 large and small tributaries, built 19 stone dikes and 45 earth dams, making every village navigable and realizing a water network. Last year, this district transported more than 7,000 tons of goods and saved more than 90,000 laborers from the transportation front. After the management of the 30 rivers, they can also irrigate 25,000 mu of farmland, increase arable land by 4,800 mu, and increase grain production by more than 1.3 million jin per year.

While vigorously managing and opening rivers, mass technological revolution movements were launched on the water. Wooden boat workers created many advanced experiences. There are excellent boat types such as fish-belly boats, seven-in-one boats, and three-section boats. Most of the dangerous shoals have been equipped with capstans, and countless small river tributaries have promoted double-wing boats. Long dragons of wooden boats dragging transportation have spread throughout thousands of miles of rivers, and transportation efficiency has increased several times over.

We used Sichuan's superior conditions for water transport to alleviate the pressure on land transport in 1958 and to make up for the shortcomings of modern transportation tools such as trains, automobiles, and ships. At present, 60% of the main raw materials and fuels, such as pig iron, ore, and coking coal, required by the steel plants in Chongqing are transported by wooden boats. Since the beginning of this year, wooden boats have undertaken the task of transporting 80% of the pig iron to the key steel plants in Chongqing, with a monthly volume of 20,000 tons.

Sichuan is one of the main grain-producing provinces in the country, and millions of tons of Sichuan grain are transferred out of the province via waterways every year. Fleets of wooden boats transport Sichuan's annually abundant grain from the Jialing River, Fu River, and Qu River to the Yangtze River coast and railway lines, and transport them into cities to supply workers and residents. Many remote areas, such as Xiushan and Youyang in southeastern Sichuan, and Tongjiang, Bazhong, and Nanjiang in northern Sichuan, used to rely mainly on manual carrying for transporting grain, with small volumes and high costs. Year after year, large amounts of grain were stockpiled and became "dead corner grain." Last year, the province opened up small rivers and gradually transported out the "dead corner grain" that had been accumulated for many years.

Driven by the iron and steel industry, inland river transport in Sichuan Province has played a huge role in connecting the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas. In the second half of last year, many industrial areas and economic crop areas had large numbers of wooden boats forming professional transportation lines, connecting the production and sales areas, so that production materials such as chemical fertilizers, pesticides, and agricultural machinery produced by factories were transported to the rural areas in time to supply agricultural production. Sichuan's abundant tangerines, live pigs, pickled mustard tubers, white fungus, medicinal materials, and other local specialties are transported out of the province. Every year, no less than hundreds of thousands of tons of chemical fertilizers, farm tools, and pesticides are distributed to the rural areas through inland river transportation lines.

Building waterways also has the advantages of low investment and quick results. For example, it costs 50,000 yuan to build one kilometer of highway, 400,000 yuan to build one kilometer of railway, and only 3,000 to 4,000 yuan to open one kilometer of waterway, which is only one-tenth of the investment in building a highway and eight-thousandths of the investment in building a railway. Therefore, mobilizing the masses to manage waterways, open up branch and small rivers, build dams to store water, raise water levels, and make full use of all available water sources so that all usable rivers can be navigable is an important way to solve the current shortage of transportation capacity.

    让八万里河川舟楫畅通
    四川省交通厅副厅长  丘先忠
    充分利用一切河流，发展水上运输，是四川省根据独具的天然条件提出的。在四川省五十七万平方公里的土地上，四百多条大小河川纵横密布，总长八万多里。从边沿山区到腹心地带，从城市到乡村，河流分布均匀，水源充足，常年通航。现在四川省正式通航里程共有一万三千二百多公里，以长江为主干，嘉陵江、沱江、岷江、乌江等为分支，形成了一个四通八达的天然水运网。
    四川内河航运除了长江和嘉陵江使用一部分轮船运输外，主要是依靠木船运输。1958年全省木船完成的货运量，约占各种运输工具总运量的40％左右。内河运输的特点是运量大、成本低，一条只通行载重十吨木船的小河支流，就相当于一条公路的运输能力；而木船运输的成本只有汽车运输成本的三分之一。像四川这样大的省，内河航运既担负了长途干线的运输任务，又是火车、轮船、汽车短途集散物资的重要工具。因此，充分利用丰富的水利资源发展内河航运就具有更重要的意义。
    四川河流虽然常年通航，但是滩多水急，暗礁丛生，运效很低。解放后，我们对航道进行了大规模的整治、开辟工作，变水害为水利，特别是1958年广大农村结合水利建设，发动群众在很短的时间内就征服了险滩、炸除礁石、疏通航道，开辟了大城河、思蒙河、蒙溪河、麻渡河、洋溪河、燕子河、通口河等小河支流五十六条，共长一千一百多公里，这些河道的整治和开辟，对保证工农业生产大跃进提供了便利的运输条件。大足县龙水区组织四千人的治水大军，在很短的时间内，就整治了大小支流三十条，修石埝十九座、土坝四十五处，村村通航，实现了水网化。去年这个区共运输物资七千多吨，并从运输战线上节约出九万多个劳动力。三十条河流经过整治后还可以灌溉田土二万五千亩，增加耕地四千八百亩，每年可增产粮食一百三十多万斤。
    在大力整河开河的同时，水上开展了群众性的技术革命运动。木船职工，创造了许多先进经验。有鱼肚船、七合一、三节船等优良船型，绝大多数的险滩都装上了绞滩机，无数的支流小河推广了双翼船，长龙般的木船拖带运输遍及万里江河，运输效率成倍提高。
    我们利用了四川水上运输这个优越条件，1958年减轻了陆上运输的压力，弥补了火车、汽车、轮船等现代运输工具的不足。重庆各钢铁厂需要的生铁、矿石、煤焦等主要原料和燃料，目前已有60％用木船运输。今年以来，木船已承担了把80％生铁运到重庆各重点钢厂的任务，每月运量达二万吨。
    四川是全国出产粮食的主要省份之一，每年都有数百万吨的川粮从水路外调，成群结队的木船，把四川年年丰收的粮食从嘉陵江、涪江、渠江运到长江沿岸和铁路沿线，运进城市供应职工和居民。许多偏僻的地区如川东南的秀山、酉阳，川北的通江、巴中、南江一带，过去运粮大部分是靠人力肩挑背运，运量小、成本高，一年年大量粮食积压下来变成了“死角粮”。去年全省开辟了小河流，把多年积存的“死角粮”也逐渐运出来了。
    在钢铁工业的带动下，四川省内河运输在沟通城乡物资交流上更发挥了巨大作用。去年下半年，许多工业区和经济作物区都有大批的木船组成专业运输线，把产、销区域连接起来，使工厂生产的化肥、农药、农械等生产资料及时运到农村供给农业生产，四川盛产的广柑、生猪、榨菜、银耳、药材等土特产品运出省外。每年通过内河运输线分散到农村的化学肥料和农具、农药都不下数十万吨。
    建设河道还有投资少、收效快的优点，如修一公里公路要投资五万元，修一公里铁路要投资四十万元，而开辟一公里航道仅需三、四千元，只相当于修公路投资的十分之一，修铁路的千分之八。因此，发动群众整治航道，开辟支、小河流，筑坝蓄水，提高水位，把一切可以利用的水源充分利用起来，使所有能利用的河流都能通航，是解决目前运输力量不足的重要办法。
