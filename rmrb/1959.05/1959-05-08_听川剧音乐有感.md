　　Thoughts on Listening to Sichuan Opera Music
　　Wang Jing
　　A few days ago, the Sichuan Provincial Sichuan Opera Troupe held a performance for the music circles in Beijing. The program was selected with music as the focus, including modern dramas such as "One-Person Store Red Flag Fluttering" and "Ding Youjun," as well as historical dramas such as "Double Worship of the Moon" and "Three Slaps." Famous actors Chen Shufang, Xu Qianyun and other comrades participated in the performance. Although the performance was only one act, one fragment, through their melodious singing, the audience felt the essence of Sichuan Opera Gaoqiang music.
　　Speaking of Sichuan Opera Gaoqiang music, musicians have had a process of understanding it. I remember during the first National Opera Performance in 1952, some musicians believed that Sichuan Opera Gaoqiang music was just some "recitation tunes," monotonous, poor, and not even considered music. This was either due to ignorance or to the influence of foreign dogmatic thinking. In short, it was a frivolous attitude towards the national artistic heritage. In recent years, through continuous performances, promotion, and introductions, and through discussions on the issue of inheriting the national artistic heritage, everyone has a further understanding of Sichuan Opera Gaoqiang music; this performance of Sichuan Opera in Beijing and the warm love and welcome it received from everyone is proof of this.
　　But the past criticisms of Sichuan Opera music, even if they were somewhat biased, promoted its innovation and continuous progress, which was not necessarily a bad thing. Compared with the 1952 performance, today's actors are more artistically mature. For example, the singing of Comrade Chen Shufang's performance of Ding Youjun before her execution was慷慨激昂, inspiring. This also shows that Sichuan Opera Gaoqiang music has many positive factors that can be used in expressing modern heroic figures. In addition, in the past, the singing was only accompanied by gongs and drums, but now they are trying to add stringed and wind instruments accompaniment; in the past, the drummer helped with the singing, but now there is a special female chorus accompaniment... These are all obvious improvements.
　　Female chorus accompaniment has a more suitable range, which allows the art of chorus accompaniment to be professionally divided, so everyone agrees. Some people feel that male voices can still be added to the chorus team (according to their normal range) to enrich the timbre and range. This is an opinion worth noting. Of course, adding male voices is not a very simple matter. Male voices will cause some changes to the female voices and the tune of the chorus accompaniment, and there will be some difficulties. But it is worth doing some cautious and planned experiments.
　　However, there are two different reactions to the increase in stringed and wind instruments accompaniment: one is in favor, and the other is against. Those who agree say that this makes the expressive means of Sichuan Opera Gaoqiang music richer and has great potential; those who oppose say that this deviates from the tradition of Gaoqiang music and is absolutely unacceptable.
　　Indeed, judging from this exhibition performance program, there are various ways to add accompaniment to Gaoqiang, and not every program has successfully solved this problem. In some programs, such as a section in "Peacock Gallbladder," the improper use of accompaniment affected the singing and damaged the original style of the actors. However, other programs have made some valuable attempts in the use of accompaniment and have gained some positive experience. Moreover, according to the comrades of the Sichuan Opera Troupe, these different approaches are just a kind of exploration and experiment. They do not intend to add accompaniment to all the programs, and many traditional programs still maintain the original performance form. These different practices have all received the support of the audience; some audiences like both unaccompanied and accompanied Gaoqiang.
　　I support the spirit of the Sichuan Opera Troupe in daring to innovate and striving to win over a wide audience.
　　Some opponents believe that the absence of stringed and wind instruments accompaniment is the tradition of Gaoqiang music, and adding accompaniment is destroying the tradition. They cite some immature accompaniment as examples to prove that Gaoqiang absolutely cannot add accompaniment. This view is worth discussing. In the development of Chinese opera, many operas did not have accompaniment at the beginning, and after there was accompaniment, the types of instruments were not fixed. If it is believed that whether or not there is accompaniment or which instruments should be used for accompaniment is a fixed tradition of an opera, then how can the development history of Chinese opera be explained? Yang Youhe, a famous Sichuan Opera actor, said it well: "The issue of adding orchestral accompaniment is mainly based on the needs of the plot. If it is added well, it will be beneficial and harmless, it will have the flavor of Gaoqiang, and it can cover up shortcomings, and it can play a role in setting off the plot." He advocates that the two practices of adding and not adding accompaniment can "coexist, so that it can be tested by the broad masses over a long period of time before a more correct conclusion can be drawn, and no one should be excluded from any practice based solely on personal preference." (Collection of Discussions on Opera Music, p. 40) In my opinion, this view is fair and truly understands opera and understands the audience.

　　听川剧音乐有感
　　王竞
    前几天，四川省川剧演出团为北京音乐界举行了一次演出。节目是以音乐为重点而选择的，有现代戏“一人商店红旗飘”、“丁佑君”等，有历史剧“双拜月”、“三击掌”等。名演员陈书舫、许倩云等同志都参加了演出。虽然演出的只是一场、一片断，但通过她们宛转的歌喉，使听众感受到川剧高腔音乐中的精华。
    说起川剧高腔音乐，音乐家们对它的认识是有一个过程的。记得1952年全国第一次戏曲会演时，有一些音乐家认为川剧高腔音乐只是一些“朗诵调”，单调、贫乏，甚至算不得音乐。这或者是由于无知，或者是由于洋教条思想在作怪，总之是对于民族艺术遗产的一种轻率的态度。这几年来，经过不断的演出、推广和介绍，经过对继承民族艺术遗产问题的讨论，大家对于川剧高腔音乐有了更进一步的看法；这次川剧在京的演出受到大家热烈的爱好和欢迎，就是一个证明。
    但过去对于川剧音乐的一些批评，即令是有所偏颇，却推动了它的革新和不断进步，这也未尝不是一件好事。和1952年会演时相比，今天演员们在艺术上更臻成熟了。例如陈书舫同志表演的丁佑君在就义前的一段歌唱，慷慨激昂，振奋人心。这也说明了川剧高腔音乐在表现现代英雄人物方面，有很多积极因素可以被利用。此外，过去唱腔只是锣鼓伴奏，现在尝试加上弦管乐器伴奏；过去是由鼓师帮腔，现在有了专门的女声帮腔……这些也都是很明显的改进。
    女声帮腔，音域比较合适，使帮腔艺术得到专业的分工，所以大家一致赞成。有人觉得帮腔队中还是可以加进男声（按照他们正常的音域），以丰富音色和音域上的变化。这是一个值得注意的意见。当然，加进男声，也不是一件非常简单的事，男声对女声和帮腔的曲调都会引起一些变化，会有一些困难。但不妨进行一些慎重的、有计划的尝试。
    增加弦管乐器伴奏，却有两种不同的反映：一种赞成，一种反对。赞成者说，这使得川剧高腔音乐的表现手段更为丰富，大有可为；反对者说，这脱离了高腔音乐的传统，实在要不得。
    的确，从这次展览性的演出节目来看，高腔加伴奏也有各种做法，并不是每一个节目都成功地解决了这个问题。有些节目，例如“孔雀胆”中的一段，由于伴奏运用不当，影响了唱腔，损伤了演员的原有风格。但另外的一些节目，在伴奏的运用上都做了一些可贵的尝试，取得了一些积极的经验。而且据川剧演出团的同志介绍，这些不同的做法，只是一种摸索和试验，他们并不打算把所有的节目都加上伴奏，许多传统节目还保持原有的演出形式。这些不同的做法，都获得了观众的支持；有些观众，对于无伴奏的和有伴奏的高腔，都是喜欢的。
    我拥护川剧演出团这种勇于革新和尽力争取广大观众的精神。
    有些反对者认为没有弦管乐器伴奏便是高腔音乐的传统，加了伴奏便是破坏传统。他们举一些不成熟的伴奏为例，证明高腔是绝对加不得伴奏的。这种看法值得商讨。在我国戏曲发展中，许多剧种在开始时都是没有伴奏的，有了伴奏以后，乐器的种类也不是固定不变的。如果认为有无伴奏或应由哪几件乐器伴奏作为一个剧种固定不变的传统，那么如何来解释我国戏曲的发展历史呢？川剧名演员阳友鹤同志说得好：“关于加管弦乐伴奏问题，主要是根据剧情的需要，如果加得好，便有益无损，既有高腔的味道，又能遮丑，并且能对剧情起陪衬烘托的作用。”他主张加与不加伴奏两种做法“可以并存，使之在广大群众当中经过长期的考验，才能得出较正确的结论，而不应该单凭个人偏爱，对任何一种作法有所排斥”。（戏曲音乐工作讨论集，第40页）我以为，这种看法是公允的，并且是真正懂得戏曲和懂得观众的。
