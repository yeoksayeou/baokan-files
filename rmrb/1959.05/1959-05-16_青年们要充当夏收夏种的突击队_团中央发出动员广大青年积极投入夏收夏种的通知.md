Xinhua News Agency, 15th - The Central Committee of the Communist Youth League of China today issued a notice to all levels of the League organizations, requiring immediate mobilization of the broad masses of young people to actively participate in the summer harvest and planting.

The notice said: The season for summer harvest and planting is approaching, and a tense labor will begin. In order to bring back all the first batch of victory fruits on the agricultural front in 1959 without any loss, the rural League organizations at all levels should immediately mobilize the Communist Youth League members and all young people to act as shock brigades for summer harvest and planting to ensure winning the victory of summer harvest and planting.

The notice put forward six tasks to the League organizations at all levels and the League members and young people:

First, do everything possible to ensure quick harvesting and threshing, and harvest and thresh well and cleanly. The notice said that this year's wheat is planted relatively densely, and harvesting, transportation, threshing, and storage are more labor-intensive than in the past. Therefore, special attention should be paid to improving tools. All good harvesting machines, threshing machines, and other harvesting and threshing tools should be promoted as soon as possible. All advanced experiences that are conducive to quick harvesting, threshing, and planting should be actively disseminated. Local League committees can work with relevant parties to hold advanced tool competitions or skill contests to launch a high-efficiency competition movement for summer harvest and planting.

Second, in order to ensure quick harvesting and threshing, youth shock brigades can also be organized to carry out shock work wherever it is needed. Places with later summer harvests and plantings and smaller summer harvest tasks should, under the unified plan and leadership of the Party, promote the spirit of collaboration and support places with earlier seasons and larger tasks. Achieve not missing the farming season, harvesting one piece when it is ripe, and planting one piece when it is harvested. How to organize the shock brigade and how to calculate labor remuneration should be decided by the leaders of the brigade or management area.

Third, in all places where summer harvest and planting tasks are tight, young people from agencies, schools, and troops should support agricultural labor in a planned way under leadership. Young people in factories and mines near rural areas should also participate in labor to support agriculture during holidays.

Fourth, before harvesting, everyone should be educated on saving food and cherishing food, so as to achieve careful harvesting and threshing, and return every grain to the home. During harvesting, carry out competitions for careful harvesting and threshing. Organize young people to pick up grain well, picking up while harvesting.

Fifth, young men and women should take the lead in carefully selecting fine seeds. Select the fine seeds with hard stalks, large ears, many grains, full seeds, disease resistance, and lodging resistance, thresh and dry them separately, and store them properly.

Sixth, in places where harvesting is late, it is still necessary to continue to firmly grasp the processing and management of summer harvest crops. The League organizations should educate young people to pay attention to both summer harvest and planting, and also to do a good job in the field management of autumn crops. The center of field management is topdressing and watering. Therefore, never relax in accumulating fertilizer, making fertilizer, and building water conservancy. At the same time, attention should also be paid to fighting against natural disasters such as drought, flood, and insects.

The notice finally said that in order to mobilize the enthusiasm of the broad masses of young people, the League committees at all levels should pay special attention to organizing League members and young people to conscientiously study and discuss the Party Central Committee's various instructions on agriculture, understand the Party's various policies, thereby boosting their soaring drive, actively participate in summer harvest and planting, and play a greater shock role in realizing the great bumper harvest in 1959.

    青年们要充当夏收夏种的突击队
    团中央发出动员广大青年积极投入夏收夏种的通知
    新华社15日讯　中国共产主义青年团中央委员会今天向各级团组织发出通知，要求立即动员广大青年积极投入夏收夏种。
    通知说：夏收夏种季节即将到来，一场紧张的劳动，就要开始。为了把1959年农业战线上第一批胜利果实全部无遗地拿回来，各级农村团的组织应当立即动员共青团员和全体青年，充当夏收夏种的突击队，保证赢得夏收夏种的胜利。
    通知向各级团组织和团员、青年们提出了六项任务：
    第一，千方百计，保证快收快打，收好打净。通知说，今年的小麦种得比较密，收割、运输、脱粒、保管，都比过去费工，因此，要特别注意改良工具。一切好的收割机脱粒机等收、打工具要尽快推广。一切对快收快打快种有利的先进经验，都要积极传播。各地团委可以同有关方面一起，召开先进工具比赛会或比巧会，展开一个夏收夏种的高工效竞赛运动。
    第二，为了保证快收快打，还可以组织青年突击队，那里需要就到那里去突击。夏收夏种较晚的和夏收任务小的地方，应当在党的统一计划、统一领导下，发扬协作精神，支援季节较早和任务比较大的地方。做到不误农时，熟一片收一片，收一片种一片。突击队怎样组织，劳动报酬如何计算，要由大队或管理区的领导决定。
    第三，一切夏收夏种任务紧张的地方，机关、学校和部队的青年，应当有领导有计划地支援农业劳动。靠近农村的厂矿青年，也应当利用假日，参加支援农业的劳动。
    第四，收割以前，要使大家都受到节约粮食、爱惜粮食的教育，做到细收细打，颗粒还家。收割当中，开展精收细打比赛。要很好地组织青少年拣粮活动，边收边拣。
    第五，男女青年应当带头精选良种。把秆硬、穗大、粒多、籽饱、抗病害、不倒伏的良种挑选出来，单打单晒，妥加保管。
    第六，收割晚的地方，对夏收作物还需要继续抓紧加工管理。团组织要教育青年既注意夏收夏种，又注意搞好大秋作物田间管理。搞好田间管理的中心是追肥浇水，因此，绝不要放松积肥造肥、兴修水利。同时还要注意向旱、涝、虫等自然灾害作斗争。
    通知最后说，为了很好地调动广大青年的积极性，各地团委应该特别注意组织团员和青年，认真地学习、讨论党中央关于农业的各项指示，了解党的各项政策，从而鼓起冲天干劲，积极地投入夏收夏种，在实现1959年大丰收中发挥更大的突击作用。
