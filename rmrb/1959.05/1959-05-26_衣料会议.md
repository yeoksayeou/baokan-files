Clothing Conference
　　Gao Shiqi

　　Clothing is the protector of the human body. Mankind's ancestors, when living in caves and the wilderness, understood this significance. They ground bones into needles and used stitched animal skins to cover their bodies; this is the origin of clothing.

　　With clothing, the human body is less likely to be contaminated by dust, garbage, and bacteria, which can cause infectious diseases. With clothing, the risk of injuries is also reduced. Clothing also helps the human body fight tirelessly against the weather: it can regulate body temperature and resist the attacks of severe cold and heat. In the snowy winter, it prevents body heat from dissipating. In the hot summer, it can block the frightening solar radiation.

　　The raw materials for making clothes are called fabrics. Fabrics have all sorts of representatives, with different family backgrounds and personal compositions. Today, they are gathered together for a conference. Let's get to know them!

　　Cotton, ramie, and flax grow in the fields, and their components are all carbohydrates.

　　Cotton was once called "white gold," and it is a proactive member of the fabric family. Since ancient times, it has diligently served mankind. After people learned to weave baskets and mats, they soon learned to use cotton to spin yarn and weave cloth.

　　From the era of handicraft industry to the era of mechanized mass production, cotton's descendants have been working busily and intensely, flying from machine to machine, from workshop to workshop. Before it reaches the sewing machine, it has to visit the dyeing and finishing factory to satisfy people's desire for beauty, and then it is warmly welcomed by the broad masses of the people.

　　Ramie and flax are also skilled at making clothes. They were once called "summer fibers." Their fibers are very strong and resilient, do not rot easily in water, and are resistant to abrasion and dissipate heat quickly. They have a wide range of uses and can be woven into various high-grade fine cloths, which are soft, refreshing, and durable when used as clothing.

　　Wool and leather both have pastures as their homes, and their components are both proteins.

　　Wool is a light, soft, durable, and warm member of the fabric family, and it is a standard-bearer in the manufacture of woolen cloth. It can keep warm because there are gaps in its structure where air can be trapped. Non-flowing air is a poor conductor of heat, making it difficult for internal heat to dissipate and external cold to penetrate.

　　After people domesticated sheep, they gradually learned the technique of shearing wool.

　　Leather is not an official representative of fabrics because it is not breathable and does not absorb moisture well, so it cannot be used for ordinary clothing. However, many members of the clothing family, such as leather hats, leather coats, leather vests, and leather shoes, are made with them, and they also operate many sideline businesses such as belts, leather bags, and suitcases. Leather must go through soaking, dehairing, tanning, and dyeing procedures before it can become truly useful leather.

　　Like leather, oilcloth and rubberized cloth are not official representatives, but they have some special uses, which is to make raincoats, rain hats, and umbrellas.

　　Silk is a beautiful figure among fabrics and an outstanding talent among fibers. It was once called the "queen" of fibers. It comes from silk farming families, and its personal component is also protein. After the silkworm has eaten its fill of mulberry leaves and grown up, it spits out a viscous liquid from a small hole in its lower lip. Upon contact with air, the liquid solidifies into beautiful silk. Silk is one of the finest and longest fibers in nature, with luster, toughness, and softness, and it can also absorb moisture.

　　The use of silk should first be attributed to the Yuanfei of our great ancestor, the Yellow Emperor—Lei Zu. This was more than 4,500 years ago. She taught women the techniques of silkworm rearing and silk reeling, and they used silk to weave silk fabrics. Later, the silk industry became more and more developed, and the working people made great progress and improvements in their experience and achievements in this field. By the Zhou Dynasty, China's silk became one of the main export commodities, bringing great honor to the motherland.

　　In the modern life of the people, people's requirements for clothing are diverse, and they also want good quality and low prices. General silk and woolen fabrics cannot yet meet these requirements, and people are working hard to find new fabrics that are more economical and more beautiful.

　　In recent years, various types of rayon, artificial cotton, artificial leather, and artificial wool have appeared on the market. These are specially invited representatives at the clothing conference.

　　Rayon comes from forests; artificial cotton comes from wood and wild fibers; artificial leather comes from oil cities; and artificial wool comes from dairy farms.

　　At the clothing conference, there is a youngest representative whose name is non-woven fabric, and it comes from chemical factories. This is the latest revolutionary achievement in the world's textile industry. Clothes made of this fabric can make us feel: lighter, more comfortable, more warmth-retaining and heat-resistant, richer and more colorful, and more economical.

　　Non-woven fabric is also called "non-woven cloth," and it can be produced in two ways. The first is the stitching method. The raw materials for textiles such as cotton, wool, hemp, and silk are combed into a fiber web, repeatedly folded into a wadding layer, and then stitched into cloth. The second is the adhesive method. The fiber web is turned into a wadding layer, and then rubber liquid is sprayed on the wadding layer to bond and press it into cloth.

　　Non-woven fabric is a new product after World War II. Because it can use low-grade raw materials, has high output and low cost, and can also manufacture varieties that the general textile industry cannot currently manufacture, countries all over the world attach great importance to its development, and its new varieties are constantly appearing.

　　The clothing representatives are truly gathered in one hall.

　　On the closing day, they passed two resolutions.

　　They called on: clothes should not be made too tight, nor should they be made too loose. If it is too tight, it will compress the internal organs of the body, hindering intestinal peristalsis and blood circulation; if it is too loose, it will hinder movement and cannot play a role in keeping warm.

　　They appealed: clothes should be washed and changed frequently, and should be taken out to bask in the sun regularly to avoid the breeding of bacteria; when storing them, you must add some camphor tablets or mothballs to prevent insect infestation. Protecting clothes is protecting your own body.

    衣料会议
    高士其
    衣服是人体的保护者。人类的祖先，在穴居野处的时候，就懂得这个意义了。他们把骨头磨成针，拿缝好的兽皮来遮盖身体，这就是衣服的起源。
    有了衣服，人体就不会受到灰尘、垃圾和细菌的污染而引起传染病；有了衣服，外伤的事故也会减轻。衣服还帮助人体同天气作不屈不挠的斗争：它能调节体温，抵抗严寒和酷暑的进攻。在冰雪的冬天，它能防止体热发散。在炎热的夏天，它又能挡住那吓人的太阳辐射。
    制造衣服的原料叫做衣料，衣料有各色各样的代表，它们的家庭出身和个人成分都不一样。今天，它们都聚集在一起开会，让我们来认识认识它们吧！
    棉花、苎麻和亚麻生长在田地里，它们的成分都是碳水化合物。
    棉花曾被称做“白色的金子”，它是衣料中的积极分子。从远古以来，它就勤勤恳恳为人类服务。在人们学会了编织筐子和席子以后，不久也就学会了用棉花来纺纱织布了。
    从手工业到机械化大生产的时代，棉花的子孙们一直都在繁忙紧张地工作着，从机器到机器，从车间到车间，它们到处飘舞着。当它未到缝纫机之前，为了满足人们爱美的愿望，还得到染整工厂去游历一番，然后受到广大人民的热烈欢迎。
    苎麻和亚麻也是制造衣服的能手，它们曾被称做“夏天的纤维”。它们的纤维非常强韧有力，见水也不容易腐烂，耐磨擦、散热快。它们的用途很广，能织各种高级细布，用作衣料既柔软爽身又经久耐穿。
    羊毛和皮革都是以牧场为家，它们的成分都是蛋白质。
    羊毛是衣料中又轻又软、经久耐用的保暖家，是制造呢料的红旗手。它们所以能保暖，是由于在它的结构中有空隙的地方，可以把空气拘留起来。不流动的空气原是热的不良导体，可以使内热不易发散，外寒不易侵入。
    在人们驯服了绵羊以后，就逐渐学会了取毛的技术。
    皮革不是衣料中的正式代表，因为它不能通风，又不大能吸收水分，因而不能作普通衣服用。可是在衣服的家属里，有许多成员如皮帽、皮大衣、皮背心、皮鞋等都是用它们来制造，它们还经营着许多副业如皮带、皮包、皮箱等。皮子要经过浸湿、去毛、鞣制、染色等手续，才能变成真正有用的皮革。
    像皮革一样，漆布、油布、橡皮布也不是正式代表，它们却有一些特种用途，那就是制造雨衣、雨帽和雨伞。
    蚕丝是衣料中的漂亮人物，也是纤维中的杰出人材，它曾被称做纤维的“皇后”。它的出身是来自养蚕之家，它的个人成分也是蛋白质。蚕虫吃饱了桑叶，发育长大后，就从下唇的小孔里吐出一种粘液，见了空气，粘液便结成美丽的丝。蚕丝在自然界中是一种最细最长的纤维之一，富有光泽，非常坚韧而又柔软，也能吸收水分。
    利用蚕丝，首先应当归功于我们伟大祖先黄帝的元妃——嫘祖。这是四千五百多年前的事。她教会了妇女们养蚕抽丝的技术，她们用蚕丝织成绸子。后来蚕丝事业越来越发达，劳动人民在这方面的经验和成就都有很大的发展和提高。到了周朝时代，我国的丝绸就成为主要的出口物资之一，给祖国带来了很大的荣誉。
    在现代人民的生活里，人们对衣服的要求是多种多样的，而且还要物美价廉，一般的丝织品和毛织品，还不能达到这样的要求，人们正在为寻找更经济、更美观的新衣料而努力着。
    近些年来，在市场上，出现了各种品种的人造丝、人造棉、人造皮革和人造羊毛，这些都是衣料会议中的特邀代表。
    人造丝来自森林；人造棉来自木材和野生纤维；人造皮革来自石油城；人造羊毛来自牛奶房。
    衣料会议中，有一位最年轻的代表，它的名字叫做无纺织布，它来自化学工厂。这是世界纺织工业中带有革命性的最新成就。这种布做成衣服能使我们感到：更轻便、更舒服，更保暖防热、更丰富多采，也更经济。
    无纺织布又有人叫做“不织的布”，可以用两种方法来生产。第一种是缝合法。把棉、毛、麻、丝等纺织用的原料梳成纤维网，经过反复拆叠变成絮层，然后再缝合成布。第二种是粘合法。把纤维网变成絮层，再用橡胶液喷在絮层上粘压成布。
    无纺织布是第二次世界大战后的新产品，因为它能利用低级原料，产量高而成本低，还能制造一般纺织工业目前不能制造的品种，所以世界各国都很重视它的发展，它的新品种不断地在出现。
    衣料代表真是济济一堂。
    在闭幕那一天，它们通过两项决议。
    它们号召：做衣服不要做得太紧，也不要做得太宽。太紧了会压迫身体内部的器官，妨碍肠管的蠕动和血液流通；太宽了妨碍动作而且不能起保暖的作用。
    它们呼吁：衣服要勤洗换，要经常拿出来晒晒太阳，以免细菌繁殖；在收藏起来的时候，还得加些樟脑片或卫生球，预防蛀虫侵蚀。保护衣服就是保护自己的身体。
