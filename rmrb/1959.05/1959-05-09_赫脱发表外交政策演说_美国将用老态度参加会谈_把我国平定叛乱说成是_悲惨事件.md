Xinhua News Agency, Washington, 8th: U.S. Secretary of State Herter delivered his first foreign policy speech since taking office on television and radio on the 7th, regarding the Geneva Foreign Ministers Conference. Herter said that although Dulles, who had represented the United States in negotiations with the Soviet Union for the past six years, had resigned, he could guarantee that U.S. "foreign policy will not lack coherence," and that the attitude the United States decided to take at the Geneva Conference would be "fully in line with the policies formulated in the past few years."

Herter said that the Western countries had a unified position at the Geneva Conference, which was: "We will not abandon our basic principles, but we are willing to negotiate how to apply these principles."

When talking about the U.S. attitude towards the several issues to be discussed at the Geneva Conference, Herter stated that on the West Berlin issue, the Soviet proposal to turn West Berlin into a free city was unacceptable to the United States, and the West would "firmly defend" their "rights and obligations" in Berlin in Geneva. He emphasized that the West was "firm" on the West Berlin issue, although this did not mean they were not prepared to negotiate.

Herter admitted that holding the East-West Foreign Ministers Conference would "provide an opportunity" to resolve some international issues, including the West Berlin issue. However, he immediately made it clear that the United States was not prepared to take this "opportunity" seriously. In order to set obstacles for the Geneva Conference, Herter talked at length throughout his speech about the issue of German reunification, which must be resolved by the Germans themselves, but avoided talking about the issue of concluding a peace treaty with Germany, although everyone knew that the issue of concluding a peace treaty with Germany was the focus of discussion at this conference, which had been agreed upon by the Soviet Union and the three Western countries.

Herter said that at the Geneva Conference, "The center of our policy can be stated simply and clearly as follows: a reunited Germany in freedom, a security system linked to arms supervision arrangements, and a free and secure Berlin in the interim period (of achieving these principles)." These words from Herter proved the earlier news from Western news agencies that the United States and other Western countries would play the so-called "package" plan at the Geneva Conference, forcibly linking issues such as the West Berlin issue and the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany, which could be resolved conditionally, with the German reunification issue and the so-called European security issue, thereby making the resolution of the issues difficult.

Herter also said that the United States would participate in the Geneva Conference with such "general goals": "to seek some progress, even if it is small, in achieving a just peace," and at the same time to "make it very clear to the Soviet Union that we have the strength and will to defend the free world."

Herter poured cold water on the Geneva Conference. He said he could frankly say that he "was not going to Geneva with great expectations."

The U.S. Secretary of State described the Geneva Conference as "the result of the Berlin crisis," and as "an opportunity created by the Soviet challenge," which showed the U.S. government's extreme lack of enthusiasm for East-West talks.

Talking about the prospect of an East-West summit, Herter reiterated Eisenhower's words that Eisenhower was prepared to attend a summit if the progress of the Foreign Ministers Conference proved that there was reason to hold a summit. Herter said: "This means that the Foreign Ministers Conference must provide some hope."

Herter then wantonly slandered China and the Soviet Union, citing the so-called "red tide" in Iraq, the Hungarian incident, and China's suppression of the Tibetan rebellion in an attempt to illustrate the threat of communism to the world. He described China's suppression of the rebellion by the Tibetan upper-class reactionary clique as a "tragic event." He said in a viciously provocative tone that this event "conspicuously showed the obvious and immediate threat of Chinese communism to all free Asians with blood." Herter's remarks were obviously an attempt to poison the atmosphere of the Geneva Conference and alienate the relationship between China and the Soviet Union and the nationally independent countries.

### 赫脱发表外交政策演说  美国将用老态度参加会谈  把我国平定叛乱说成是“悲惨事件”

    赫脱发表外交政策演说
    美国将用老态度参加会谈
    把我国平定叛乱说成是“悲惨事件”
    新华社8日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国务卿赫脱7日在电视广播中就日内瓦外长会议发表他就任以来的第一次外交政策演说。赫脱说，虽然过去六年来一直代表美国同苏联谈判的杜勒斯已经辞职了，但是他可以保证，美国的“外交政策将不会缺乏连贯性”，美国决定在日内瓦会议上采取的态度将“充分符合过去几年所制订的各项政策”。
    赫脱说，西方国家在日内瓦会议上有一个一致的立场，这个立场就是：“我们不会背弃我们的基本原则，但是我们愿意谈判如何运用这些原则。”
    谈到美国对于在日内瓦会议上将要讨论的几个问题的态度时，赫脱表示，在西柏林问题上，苏联关于把西柏林变为自由城市的建议是美国所不能接受的，西方将要在日内瓦“坚决维护”它们在柏林的“权利和义务”。他强调说，西方在西柏林问题上是“坚定”的，虽然这并不意味着它们不准备谈判。
    赫脱承认，东西方外长会议的举行将为解决一些国际问题，其中包括西柏林问题“提供一个机会”。但是他随即表明，美国并不准备认真对待这个“机会”。为了给日内瓦会议设置障碍，赫脱在通篇演说中大谈其必须由德国人自己解决的德国重新统一问题，却避而不谈缔结对德和约问题，虽然大家知道，缔结对德和约问题是苏联和西方三国已经协议的这次会议要着重讨论的问题。
    赫脱说，在日内瓦会议上，“我们政策的中心可以简单明确地说成是这样：一个在自由中重新统一的德国，一个同武器监督安排联系起来的安全制度，以及在（实现这些原则的）中间这段时期内保持一个自由而安全的柏林”。赫脱这些话证明了早些时候西方通讯社透露的消息，美国和其他西方国家将在日内瓦会议上玩弄所谓“一揽子”计划，硬要把西柏林问题和缔结对德和约问题这样一些有条件解决的问题同德国统一问题以及所谓欧洲安全问题等等拉扯在一起，从而使得问题的解决变得困难起来。
    赫脱还说，美国将要抱着这样一些“总的目的”参加日内瓦会议：“谋求在实现公正的和平方面获得一些进展，即使是微小的进展”，同时要“向苏联十分清楚地表明，我们具有维护自由世界的力量和意志。”
    赫脱为日内瓦会议大泼冷水。他说，他可以坦白地说，他“并不是抱着很大的期望去日内瓦的”。
    这位美国国务卿把日内瓦会议说成是“柏林危机的结果”，说成是由于“苏联的挑战而造成的机会”，他的这些话表现出美国政府对东西方会谈极其缺乏热忱。
    谈到东西方首脑会议的前景时，赫脱重申艾森豪威尔的话说，艾森豪威尔准备参加最高级会议，如果外长会议的进展证明有理由举行最高级会议的话。赫脱说：“这意味着，外长会议必须提供某种希望。”
    赫脱接着大肆诬蔑中国和苏联，他举出伊拉克的所谓“红色浪潮”、匈牙利事件以及中国平息西藏叛乱的事情来企图说明共产主义对世界的威胁。他把中国对西藏上层反动集团的叛乱的平息说做是一个“悲惨事件”。他以恶毒的挑拨口吻说，这个事件“用鲜血引人注目地表现了中国共产主义对所有自由亚洲人的眼前的明显威胁。”赫脱说这些话显然是企图以此来毒化日内瓦会议的气氛，离间中苏两国同民族独立国家的关系。
