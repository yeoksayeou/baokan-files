Xinhua News Agency, May 30th - According to a report from the Vietnam News Agency: Gunfire could be heard in the western border region of Vietnam on the 29th, proving that the Lao Phoui Sananikone government's troops are still attacking the Lao fighting units.

According to news received last night, many battalions of Phoui Sananikone's troops, supported by heavy artillery, launched an attack on the Lao fighting units in the Meng Fang area east of Xieng Khouang on May 28th. The Lao fighting units returned fire in self-defense. It is reported that the Lao fighting units repelled the attack.

The news also said that the Phoui Sananikone government is sending more troops to the area in an attempt to continue the civil war it deliberately provoked.

Xinhua News Agency, Washington, May 30th - In order to cope with the criticism from the world's just public opinion, the U.S. State Department issued a statement on the 29th, attempting to defend the U.S.'s instigation of the Lao Kingdom government to attack the former Lao fighting units, destroy the Geneva Accords, and escalate the tense situation in Southeast Asia.

The statement deliberately avoids mentioning the ironclad facts that the Lao Kingdom government, under U.S. instigation and support, tore up its promise to guarantee the democratic and free rights of former resistance personnel and even openly attacked the former Lao fighting units with force, thus violating the agreement and launching a civil war. Instead, it argued out of thin air: "The Communist's argument that Laos violated its international agreements is fabricated. It is the Communists who are now violating and have always violated the Lao agreements."

The statement tries its best to conceal the crime of the U.S. instigating and supporting the Lao Kingdom army to attack the former Lao fighting units. It said: "The United States has nothing to do with this matter, it did not participate in the efforts made by the Lao Kingdom government." However, everyone knows, and even Americans themselves admit, that the Lao government army, which is now brazenly surrounding and attacking the former Lao fighting units, is a "national guard whose entire expenses are paid by American taxpayers." A former official of the U.S. International Cooperation Administration stationed in Laos, Miller, recently admitted that the United States has given Laos $135 million in military aid in the past three and a half years, and a large number of U.S. military personnel, weapons, and ammunition have been shipped to Laos. Not long ago, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State for Far Eastern Affairs Robertson boasted triumphantly about the "achievements" of the U.S. "aid" to Laos. Lao Foreign Minister Khamphan Panya also openly stated on the 21st that the Lao government will rely on the Southeast Asian aggressive bloc controlled by the United States.

The U.S. State Department's statement finally, as usual, viciously slandered China in an attempt to cover up the crimes of U.S. imperialism. It falsely accused China of "violating the agreement" and said: "The tension in Southeast Asia exists only because the Chinese Communists have consistently adopted such tactics, namely, expanding their controlled areas through infiltration, subversion, and the threat of hostile military action."

### 老挝政府军继续进攻寮国战斗部队  美国务院为老挝政府开脱罪责并大肆反共反华

    老挝政府军继续进攻寮国战斗部队
    美国务院为老挝政府开脱罪责并大肆反共反华
    新华社30日讯　据越南通讯社消息：在越南西部边境地区29日可以听见枪声、这证明老挝培·萨纳尼空政府的军队还在继续攻击寮国战斗部队。
    根据昨晚收到的消息，培·萨纳尼空军队许多营在重炮支援下，5月28日向川圹东面的孟坊地区的寮国战斗部队发动了进攻。寮国战斗部队为了自卫进行还击。据报道寮国战斗部队击退了这次进攻。
    消息又说，培·萨纳尼空政府正在派遣更多的军队到这一地区去，企图继续进行它故意挑起的内战。
    新华社30日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国务院为了应付世界正义舆论的抨击，在29日发表声明，妄图为美国策动老挝王国政府进攻前寮国战斗部队、破坏日内瓦协议、加剧东南亚紧张局势的行为辩护。
    这个声明故意避而不谈老挝王国政府在美国教唆与支持下撕毁保证前抗战人员民主自由权利的诺言甚至公开以武力进攻前寮国战斗部队等破坏协议、发动内战的铁一般的事实，而凭空狡辩说：“共产党人所说的老挝破坏它的国际协议的论点是虚构的。现在破坏并且过去一直破坏老挝协议的，正是共产党人。”
    声明极力掩饰美国策动与支持老挝王国军队进攻前寮国战斗部队的罪行。它说：“美国同这件事没有任何关系，它没有参加老挝王国政府所作的努力。”但是，人们都知道，甚至美国人自己也承认，目前悍然包围并进攻前寮国战斗部队的老挝政府军队，是一支“由美国纳税人支付其全部经费的国民警备队”。美国国际合作署前驻老挝的一个官员密勒不久前承认，最近三年半以来，美国就给了老挝一亿三千五百万美元的军事援助，并且有大批美国军事人员和武器弹药运进老挝。不久以前，美国远东事务助理国务卿罗伯逊就曾得意忘形地吹嘘美国“援助”老挝的“成就”。而老挝王国外交大臣坎番·班雅21日也公开表示老挝政府将投靠美国控制下的东南亚侵略集团。
    美国国务院的明声最后照例恶毒地诽谤中国，妄图以此掩盖美帝国主义的罪行。它反诬中国“破坏协议”，并且说：“东南亚之所以存在紧张局势只是因为中国共产党人一贯采取这样的策略，即通过渗入、颠复和采取敌对军事行动的威胁来扩大他们的控制地区。”
