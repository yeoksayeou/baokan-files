This newspaper reports: Fujian Hua'an Shajian Commune, in developing poultry production, conscientiously implements the policy of walking on two legs, both public and private raising, and fully utilizes the superiority of the commune to solve the problems of seedlings, feed, and labor. As a result, the commune's poultry production is thriving, with more than 59,000 chickens, ducks, and geese, nearly tripling compared to the early stage of the commune's establishment, averaging more than ten chickens, ducks, and geese per household.

Shajian Commune's poultry production did not develop rapidly in the previous period. The Party Committee analyzed the reasons for this and believed that the main reason was that the leadership did not pay close attention, and at the same time, the policy of walking on two legs, both public and private raising, was not well implemented. Therefore, it was decided that the Commune Party Secretary should take the lead in establishing a poultry production guidance committee to vigorously publicize the policy of collective and household breeding by commune members. At the same time, it was clearly announced that whoever raises the poultry owns it and earns more income, and specific regulations were made that the income from poultry raised by teams and canteens is at the disposal of the breeding unit; the income from poultry raised by commune members is at the disposal of the individual. Moreover, the masses were informed of the benefits of developing poultry production: first, it can give full play to the role of the elderly and weak labor force; second, it can increase the income of collectives and individuals and improve the lives of commune members; third, it can ensure the supply to the market. As a result, the enthusiasm of production teams, canteens, and commune members in developing poultry production was greatly stimulated. In addition to raising more chickens and ducks themselves, commune members also invested in mother birds, hatching eggs, and wood and tiles for building poultry sheds to develop collective poultry farming.

The commune decided to establish young poultry breeding farms at the team level to breed young poultry on a large scale, and to publicize the principle of "eat less and hatch more" to the commune members, calling on them not to eat hatching eggs and to hatch more young poultry. In this way, a mass hatching upsurge was quickly set off, and the whole commune developed more than 59,000 chickens, ducks, and geese, including 4,500 raised by commune-run poultry farms, 30,000 raised by teams and canteens, and 25,000 raised by individual commune members.

Cadres took the lead, the masses took action, and the whole commune opened up a broad source of feed. The five-character method of "planting, breeding, manufacturing, substitution, and driving" was summarized: "planting" means using the front and back of houses and the edges of fields to plant green feed; "breeding" means breeding white ants with leaves and bark; "manufacturing" means processing peanut shells and other materials into feed; "substitution" means using various substitute feeds; "driving" means driving geese up the mountains and driving ducks down to the fields. After the cadres of the Xiawei Canteen went to the mountains to cut grass and successfully bred white ants, all 300 chickens in the canteen were fed with white ants, and the chickens grew very quickly.

This newspaper reports: The Hou'anping Production Team of Lutun Commune in Gaiping County, Liaoning Province, has adopted measures such as "private raising with public assistance and fixed meat consumption" and "sow 'division' raising, with percentage of piglets," which have mobilized the enthusiasm of commune members in raising pigs, and the morale of commune members in raising pigs is high, and pig production has developed rapidly.

The commune members of the Hou'anping Production Team have had the habit of raising pigs in the past, especially raising more sows. In order to further develop pig production, after consulting with commune members, it was decided to take the following three measures.

First, private raising with public assistance and fixed meat consumption. The specific method is: the production team lends piglets to commune members, each pig is lent 400 catties of sugar residue, and the fine feed is purchased by the commune members themselves according to the national supply standard. At the same time, commune members are mobilized to plant melons and collect wild feed in front of and behind their houses to solve the feed problem. After the pigs are raised, the team buys them back and pays according to the quality. The production team is also responsible for pulling twenty carts of soil to pad the pigsty for each pig. In order to solve the problem of meat consumption for commune members, it is stipulated that commune members who raise two pigs can eat one themselves, and those who raise one pig can eat half of it, according to the method of "more raising, more eating, less raising, less eating," and the rest is sold to the state at the listed price. At the same time, the production team and commune members signed a pig-raising meat contract, so that commune members can be sure of the situation. This eliminates the ideological concerns of commune members. In order to encourage commune members to carefully raise pigs, the team stipulates that those who weigh more than 150 catties can be slaughtered for eating and selling. If they are sold privately in the middle of the journey, the production team will recover all the pig money and feed advance payments.

Second, sow "division" raising, with percentage of piglets. The production team distributes the sows to the canteen for breeding, and the production team provides each sow with 1,000 catties of sugar residue and 200 catties of fine feed. The part that is not enough is solved by the canteen. The piglets bred are divided according to a ratio of four to six, that is, four parts to the canteen and six parts to the production team. This promotes everyone to care about collective pig raising, do a good job in collective pig raising, and improve the breeding rate.

Third, special personnel raise three things and give one reward. In order to strengthen the breeding and raising of sows, the canteens are used as units to determine special personnel to raise them, and a management system of fixed tasks, fixed feed, fixed remuneration, and rewards for exceeding quotas is implemented. The specific method is: 20 work points are paid to feed one sow per month; 10 work points are paid for each piglet in a litter of eight until the weaning is completed; when there are more than eight piglets in a litter, in addition to paying work points according to the number, each piglet is awarded five work points. If losses are caused due to poor feeding management, the breeder shall compensate.

The Hou'anping Production Team has a total of 567 households. The team has 69 sows. Except for three piglets, the rest are all pregnant. According to an average of eight piglets per sow, more than 500 piglets can be born. In addition to the existing pigs of the commune members, the plan of one pig per household can be realized by the end of May. If each sow produces another litter of piglets by the end of the year, it can be doubled to achieve two pigs per household. Now the team has allocated 26 piglets to commune members for raising. Commune members are taking time out in the morning and evening to repair pigsties.

    公养私养并举大养猪鸡鸭鹅
    芦屯公社后安平队采取有效措施迅速增添生猪
    沙建公社家禽几个月内比建社初期增加近两倍
    本报讯  福建华安沙建公社在发展家禽生产中，认真贯彻执行公养和私养两条腿走路的方针，并充分发挥公社的优越性，解决了种苗、饲料、劳力问题，因而使全社家禽生产欣欣向荣，鸡鸭鹅达到五万九千多只，比办社初期增加近两倍，平均每户有鸡鸭鹅十多只。
    沙建公社前一时期家禽生产发展不快，党委会检查分析原因，认为主要是领导上抓得不紧，同时没有很好贯彻执行公养和私养两条腿走路的方针。于是，决定由公社党委书记挂帅，建立家禽生产指导委员会，大力宣传集体饲养和社员家庭饲养并举的方针，同时明确宣布谁养谁所有、多养多收入的政策，具体规定队和食堂饲养的家禽，其收入归饲养单位支配；社员个人养禽，其收入归个人支配。而且向群众宣传发展家禽生产的好处：一、能充分发挥老弱劳力的作用；二、增加集体和个人的收入，改善社员生活；三、能保证对市场的供应。这样一来，大大刺激了生产队、食堂和社员发展家禽生产的积极性。社员们除了自己多养鸡、鸭外，还纷纷向队、食堂投资母禽、种蛋和盖禽舍用的木材、瓦片等，发展集体养禽业。
    社里决定以队为单位建立幼禽抚育场，大规模繁殖幼禽，并且向社员宣传“少吃多孵”的道理，号召社员不吃种蛋，多孵幼禽。这样，迅速掀起了群众性的孵化热潮，全社共发展了鸡鸭鹅五万九千多只，其中社办养禽场养的有四千五百只，队、食堂养的三万只，社员个人饲养的二万五千只。
    干部带头、群众动手，全社开辟了广阔的饲料来源。总结了“种、繁、制、代、赶”五字妙法：“种”就是利用屋前屋后、田头田尾种植青饲料；
  “繁”就是用树叶树皮繁殖白蚂蚁；“制”就是用花生壳等加工成饲料；“代”就是采用各种代饲料；“赶”就是赶鹅上山、赶鸭下田。下尾食堂干部到山上割草回来繁殖白蚂蚁成功后，全食堂三百多只鸡全用白蚂蚁喂养，而且鸡长得很快。
    本报讯  辽宁盖平县芦屯公社后安平生产队，采取“私养公助定吃肉”
  “母猪‘分’养，见崽提成”等措施，调动了社员养猪积极性，社员养猪情绪高涨，生猪生产迅速发展。
    后安平生产队的社员，过去就有养猪习惯，特别是母猪养得较多。为了进一步发展生猪生产，经过和社员共同商量，决定采取以下三个措施。
    一、私养公助定吃肉。具体作法是：生产队贷给社员仔猪，每口猪贷给糖糟四百斤，精饲料按国家供应标准，预支钱给社员自己购买。同时发动社员房前屋后多种瓜类和收集野生饲料，解决饲料问题。猪养成了由队收买，以质论价给报酬，生产队并负责给每头猪拉二十车土垫圈。为了解决社员吃肉的问题，规定社员养两头猪可自吃一头，养一头自吃一半的“多养多吃，少养少吃”的办法，余者按牌价卖给国家。同时生产队和社员签订养猪用肉合同，使社员心里有数。这就消除了社员的思想顾虑。为鼓励社员精心饲养，队里规定了够一百五十斤以上的可杀吃和出售，如中途私自卖掉，生产队就把猪款、饲料预支款全部收回。
    二、母猪“分”养，见小猪提成。生产队把母猪分给食堂饲养繁殖，由生产队供给每头母猪一千斤糖糟和二百斤精饲料，不足部分由食堂解决，繁殖的小猪按四六提成，即食堂四成，生产队六成。这样就促使社员人人关心集体养猪，搞好集体养猪，提高繁殖率。
    三、专人饲养三定一奖。为了加强母猪饲养繁殖，以食堂为单位，确定专人饲养，并实行定任务、定饲料、定报酬和超额奖励的管理制度。具体作法是：喂一口母猪每月付给二十个工分；一窝定八个小猪，每个小猪到分窝止付给十个工分；一窝超过八个小猪时，除按数付给工分外，每个小猪奖五个工分。如因饲养管理不善而受损失，由饲养员赔偿。
    后安平生产队共五百六十七户，全队有六十九头母猪，除三头小猪外，其余都满怀，平均每头母猪按八个小猪算可下五百多个小猪，加上社员现有的，到五月底可以实现每户一头猪的计划。每头母猪到年底再下一窝小猪，就可翻一番，实现每户两头猪。现在队里已拨出二十六个小猪给社员饲养。社员们都抽出早晚空隙修整猪圈。
