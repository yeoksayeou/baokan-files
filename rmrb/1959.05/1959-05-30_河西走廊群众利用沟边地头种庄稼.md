Masses in the Hexi Corridor Utilize Ditch Edges and Field Headlands to Plant Crops

    This Dispatch from Hangzhou, May 29th – The Zhejiang Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has instructed all areas of the province to fully utilize vacant and idle land to plant crops.
    Zhejiang is a naturally favorable agricultural province with mountains, rivers, plains, and oceans, and the cultivated land area has always been relatively high. However, according to a recent estimate by the Zhejiang Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, there are still two to three million mu of non-cultivated land that can be utilized throughout the province. This includes young forests of mulberry, tea, and tung oil trees, areas of barren land, burnt mountain land, sandy beaches and mudflats along rivers and coasts, vacant and idle land along pond dikes, riverbanks, roadsides, canal banks, field edges, and around houses, as well as crisscrossing rivers, ponds, and ditches. Therefore, the Zhejiang Provincial Committee recently instructed all areas of the province to fully utilize these vacant and idle lands and water surfaces to plant minor grains and breed aquatic products and aquatic plants, in order to solve the need for feed for the large-scale development of livestock and poultry.
    This Dispatch from Lanzhou, May 29th – In the fertile Hexi Corridor of Gansu, the sowing date this year will be extended until July. The Hexi Corridor region is vast and has a large amount of fertile arable wasteland. In the past, the masses here had the habit of reclaiming and cultivating land. Every year, after the cultivated land was planted, they would always plant some "bump crops" on some wasteland without fixed water conservancy conditions, but with better soil moisture or with the expectation of being able to irrigate once. The masses said, "One year of planting bump crops keeps you from hunger for three years." This year, people's communes in Shandan, Yongchang, Gaotai, Jiuquan, Yumen, Anxi, Minqin and other counties (cities), in addition to extensively reclaiming wasteland and planting "bump crops", are also calling on commune members to do everything possible to tap the potential of the land, and to make full use of the edges of canals and ditches, the edges of fields and ridges, and the areas in front of courtyards and behind houses to plant crops and vegetables, so that no inch of land is left idle. At present, the multi-planting and quick-planting work of the various communes is continuing.
    During this period, the leadership departments also adopted various organizational measures to help the communes solve some specific problems. For example, in terms of labor arrangement, they are generally divided into two teams, one to focus on summer field management and the other to focus on autumn planting. In terms of water use, under the premise of practicing strict economy and rational irrigation, priority is given to wheat field water use, and then as much water as possible is used to irrigate "bump crops." Regarding the seed problem, the grassroots units first make adjustments on their own, and finally the county leading organs assist in solving the problem.

    河西走廊群众利用沟边地头种庄稼
    本报杭州29日电　中共浙江省委指示全省各地充分利用空隙闲地种植农作物。
    浙江是一个有山有水，有平原有海洋的天然良好的农业省份，土地的耕种面积一向是较高的。但据中共浙江省委最近的估算，全省可以利用的非耕地面积仍然还有二、三百万亩之多。其中有桑、茶、油桐、水果的幼林地，花白地，烧山地，沿江沿海的沙滩和涂地，塘堤河沿、道旁渠畔、田边地角、房前屋后等处的空隙闲地，还有纵横交叉的河塘沟渠等等。为此，浙江省委在最近指示全省各地要把这些空隙闲地和水面充分地利用起来，种植小杂粮和繁殖水产、水草，以便解决大量发展牲畜和家禽的饲料需要。
    本报兰州29日电　沃野千里的甘肃河西走廊，今年的播种日期一直要延长到7月份。河西走廊地区辽阔，有大量肥沃可耕的荒地。过去这里的群众就有垦种的习惯，每年耕地种完以后，总要在一些没有固定的水利条件，但地墒较好或估计能浇上一次水的荒地上种些“撞田”。群众说：“一年撞下，三年不饥”。今年，山丹、永昌、高台、酒泉、玉门、安西、民勤等县（市）的人民公社除了广泛开荒和种“撞田”外，还号召社员千方百计挖掘土地潜力，尽量利用渠边沟沿，地头埂畔，庭前院后等地种庄稼和蔬菜，不让寸土尺地空闲。现在各公社的多种快种工作正在继续开展。
    各领导部门在这期间还采取了各项组织措施，帮助各公社解决一些具体问题。例如，在劳动力安排上一般都分成两套人马，一抓夏季的田间管理，一抓秋田抢种。在用水方面，在厉行节约和合理灌溉的前提下，首先满足麦田用水，再尽量多浇些“撞田”。有关种籽问题，先由各基层单位自行调剂，最后再由县领导机关协助解决。
